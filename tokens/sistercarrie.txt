THE
MAGNET
ATTRACTING
--
A
WAIF
AMID
FORCES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Caroline
Meeber
boarded
the
afternoon
train
for
Chicago
,
her
total
*NL*
outfit
consisted
of
a
small
trunk
,
a
cheap
imitation
alligator-skin
*NL*
satchel
,
a
small
lunch
in
a
paper
box
,
and
a
yellow
leather
snap
purse
,
*NL*
containing
her
ticket
,
a
scrap
of
paper
with
her
sister
's
address
in
Van
*NL*
Buren
Street
,
and
four
dollars
in
money
.
It
was
in
August
,
1889
.
She
*NL*
was
eighteen
years
of
age
,
bright
,
timid
,
and
full
of
the
illusions
of
*NL*
ignorance
and
youth
.
Whatever
touch
of
regret
at
parting
characterised
*NL*
her
thoughts
,
it
was
certainly
not
for
advantages
now
being
given
up
.
A
*NL*
gush
of
tears
at
her
mother
's
farewell
kiss
,
a
touch
in
her
throat
when
*NL*
the
cars
clacked
by
the
flour
mill
where
her
father
worked
by
the
day
,
*NL*
a
pathetic
sigh
as
the
familiar
green
environs
of
the
village
passed
in
*NL*
review
,
and
the
threads
which
bound
her
so
lightly
to
girlhood
and
home
*NL*
were
irretrievably
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
there
was
always
the
next
station
,
where
one
might
descend
*NL*
and
return
.
There
was
the
great
city
,
bound
more
closely
by
these
very
*NL*
trains
which
came
up
daily
.
Columbia
City
was
not
so
very
far
away
,
*NL*
even
once
she
was
in
Chicago
.
What
,
pray
,
is
a
few
hours
--
a
few
hundred
*NL*
miles
?
She
looked
at
the
little
slip
bearing
her
sister
's
address
and
*NL*
wondered
.
She
gazed
at
the
green
landscape
,
now
passing
in
swift
*NL*
review
,
until
her
swifter
thoughts
replaced
its
impression
with
vague
*NL*
conjectures
of
what
Chicago
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
girl
leaves
her
home
at
eighteen
,
she
does
one
of
two
things
.
*NL*
Either
she
falls
into
saving
hands
and
becomes
better
,
or
she
rapidly
*NL*
assumes
the
cosmopolitan
standard
of
virtue
and
becomes
worse
.
Of
an
*NL*
intermediate
balance
,
under
the
circumstances
,
there
is
no
possibility
.
*NL*
The
city
has
its
cunning
wiles
,
no
less
than
the
infinitely
smaller
and
*NL*
more
human
tempter
.
There
are
large
forces
which
allure
with
all
the
*NL*
soulfulness
of
expression
possible
in
the
most
cultured
human
.
The
gleam
*NL*
of
a
thousand
lights
is
often
as
effective
as
the
persuasive
light
in
a
*NL*
wooing
and
fascinating
eye
.
Half
the
undoing
of
the
unsophisticated
and
*NL*
natural
mind
is
accomplished
by
forces
wholly
superhuman
.
A
blare
*NL*
of
sound
,
a
roar
of
life
,
a
vast
array
of
human
hives
,
appeal
to
the
*NL*
astonished
senses
in
equivocal
terms
.
Without
a
counsellor
at
hand
to
*NL*
whisper
cautious
interpretations
,
what
falsehoods
may
not
these
things
*NL*
breathe
into
the
unguarded
ear
!
Unrecognised
for
what
they
are
,
their
*NL*
beauty
,
like
music
,
too
often
relaxes
,
then
weakens
,
then
perverts
the
*NL*
simpler
human
perceptions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Caroline
,
or
Sister
Carrie
,
as
she
had
been
half
affectionately
termed
*NL*
by
the
family
,
was
possessed
of
a
mind
rudimentary
in
its
power
of
*NL*
observation
and
analysis
.
Self-interest
with
her
was
high
,
but
not
*NL*
strong
.
It
was
,
nevertheless
,
her
guiding
characteristic
.
Warm
with
the
*NL*
fancies
of
youth
,
pretty
with
the
insipid
prettiness
of
the
formative
*NL*
period
,
possessed
of
a
figure
promising
eventual
shapeliness
and
an
eye
*NL*
alight
with
certain
native
intelligence
,
she
was
a
fair
example
of
the
*NL*
middle
American
class
--
two
generations
removed
from
the
emigrant
.
Books
*NL*
were
beyond
her
interest
--
knowledge
a
sealed
book
.
In
the
intuitive
*NL*
graces
she
was
still
crude
.
She
could
scarcely
toss
her
head
gracefully
.
*NL*
Her
hands
were
almost
ineffectual
.
The
feet
,
though
small
,
were
set
*NL*
flatly
.
And
yet
she
was
interested
in
her
charms
,
quick
to
understand
*NL*
the
keener
pleasures
of
life
,
ambitious
to
gain
in
material
things
.
*NL*
A
half-equipped
little
knight
she
was
,
venturing
to
reconnoitre
*NL*
the
mysterious
city
and
dreaming
wild
dreams
of
some
vague
,
far-off
*NL*
supremacy
,
which
should
make
it
prey
and
subject
--
the
proper
penitent
,
*NL*
grovelling
at
a
woman
's
slipper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
a
voice
in
her
ear
,
``
is
one
of
the
prettiest
little
resorts
*NL*
in
Wisconsin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
''
she
answered
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
was
just
pulling
out
of
Waukesha
.
For
some
time
she
had
been
*NL*
conscious
of
a
man
behind
.
She
felt
him
observing
her
mass
of
hair
.
*NL*
He
had
been
fidgetting
,
and
with
natural
intuition
she
felt
a
certain
*NL*
interest
growing
in
that
quarter
.
Her
maidenly
reserve
,
and
a
certain
*NL*
sense
of
what
was
conventional
under
the
circumstances
,
called
her
to
*NL*
forestall
and
deny
this
familiarity
,
but
the
daring
and
magnetism
of
*NL*
the
individual
,
born
of
past
experiences
and
triumphs
,
prevailed
.
She
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
forward
to
put
his
elbows
upon
the
back
of
her
seat
and
*NL*
proceeded
to
make
himself
volubly
agreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
is
a
great
resort
for
Chicago
people
.
The
hotels
are
swell
.
*NL*
You
are
not
familiar
with
this
part
of
the
country
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
am
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
``
That
is
,
I
live
at
Columbia
City
.
I
*NL*
have
never
been
through
here
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
this
is
your
first
visit
to
Chicago
,
''
he
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
she
was
conscious
of
certain
features
out
of
the
side
of
*NL*
her
eye
.
Flush
,
colourful
cheeks
,
a
light
moustache
,
a
grey
fedora
*NL*
hat
.
She
now
turned
and
looked
upon
him
in
full
,
the
instincts
of
*NL*
self-protection
and
coquetry
mingling
confusedly
in
her
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
say
that
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
answered
,
in
a
very
pleasing
way
and
with
an
assumed
air
of
*NL*
mistake
,
``
I
thought
you
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
type
of
the
travelling
canvasser
for
a
manufacturing
house
--
a
*NL*
class
which
at
that
time
was
first
being
dubbed
by
the
slang
of
the
day
*NL*
``
drummers
.
''
He
came
within
the
meaning
of
a
still
newer
term
,
which
had
*NL*
sprung
into
general
use
among
Americans
in
1880
,
and
which
concisely
*NL*
expressed
the
thought
of
one
whose
dress
or
manners
are
calculated
to
*NL*
elicit
the
admiration
of
susceptible
young
women
--
a
``
masher
.
''
His
suit
*NL*
was
of
a
striped
and
crossed
pattern
of
brown
wool
,
new
at
that
time
,
*NL*
but
since
become
familiar
as
a
business
suit
.
The
low
crotch
of
the
vest
*NL*
revealed
a
stiff
shirt
bosom
of
white
and
pink
stripes
.
From
his
coat
*NL*
sleeves
protruded
a
pair
of
linen
cuffs
of
the
same
pattern
,
fastened
*NL*
with
large
,
gold
plate
buttons
,
set
with
the
common
yellow
agates
known
*NL*
as
``
cat
's
-
eyes
.
''
His
fingers
bore
several
rings
--
one
,
the
ever-enduring
*NL*
heavy
seal
--
and
from
his
vest
dangled
a
neat
gold
watch
chain
,
from
*NL*
which
was
suspended
the
secret
insignia
of
the
Order
of
Elks
.
The
whole
*NL*
suit
was
rather
tight-fitting
,
and
was
finished
off
with
heavy-soled
tan
*NL*
shoes
,
highly
polished
,
and
the
grey
fedora
hat
.
He
was
,
for
the
order
*NL*
of
intellect
represented
,
attractive
,
and
whatever
he
had
to
recommend
*NL*
him
,
you
may
be
sure
was
not
lost
upon
Carrie
,
in
this
,
her
first
*NL*
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lest
this
order
of
individual
should
permanently
pass
,
let
me
put
down
*NL*
some
of
the
most
striking
characteristics
of
his
most
successful
manner
*NL*
and
method
.
Good
clothes
,
of
course
,
were
the
first
essential
,
the
*NL*
things
without
which
he
was
nothing
.
A
strong
physical
nature
,
actuated
*NL*
by
a
keen
desire
for
the
feminine
,
was
the
next
.
A
mind
free
of
any
*NL*
consideration
of
the
problems
or
forces
of
the
world
and
actuated
not
*NL*
by
greed
,
but
an
insatiable
love
of
variable
pleasure
.
His
method
was
*NL*
always
simple
.
Its
principal
element
was
daring
,
backed
,
of
course
,
by
*NL*
an
intense
desire
and
admiration
for
the
sex
.
Let
him
meet
with
a
young
*NL*
woman
once
and
he
would
approach
her
with
an
air
of
kindly
familiarity
,
*NL*
not
unmixed
with
pleading
,
which
would
result
in
most
cases
in
a
*NL*
tolerant
acceptance
.
If
she
showed
any
tendency
to
coquetry
he
would
be
*NL*
apt
to
straighten
her
tie
,
or
if
she
``
took
up
''
with
him
at
all
,
to
call
*NL*
her
by
her
first
name
.
If
he
visited
a
department
store
it
was
to
lounge
*NL*
familiarly
over
the
counter
and
ask
some
leading
questions
.
In
more
*NL*
exclusive
circles
,
on
the
train
or
in
waiting
stations
,
he
went
slower
.
*NL*
If
some
seemingly
vulnerable
object
appeared
he
was
all
attention
--
to
*NL*
pass
the
compliments
of
the
day
,
to
lead
the
way
to
the
parlor
car
,
*NL*
carrying
her
grip
,
or
,
failing
that
,
to
take
a
seat
next
her
with
the
*NL*
hope
of
being
able
to
court
her
to
her
destination
.
Pillows
,
books
,
a
*NL*
footstool
,
the
shade
lowered
;
all
these
figured
in
the
things
which
he
*NL*
could
do
.
If
,
when
she
reached
her
destination
he
did
not
alight
and
*NL*
attend
her
baggage
for
her
,
it
was
because
,
in
his
own
estimation
,
he
*NL*
had
signally
failed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
should
some
day
write
the
complete
philosophy
of
clothes
.
No
*NL*
matter
how
young
,
it
is
one
of
the
things
she
wholly
comprehends
.
There
*NL*
is
an
indescribably
faint
line
in
the
matter
of
man
's
apparel
which
*NL*
somehow
divides
for
her
those
who
are
worth
glancing
at
and
those
*NL*
who
are
not
.
Once
an
individual
has
passed
this
faint
line
on
the
way
*NL*
downward
he
will
get
no
glance
from
her
.
There
is
another
line
at
*NL*
which
the
dress
of
a
man
will
cause
her
to
study
her
own
.
This
line
the
*NL*
individual
at
her
elbow
now
marked
for
Carrie
.
She
became
conscious
*NL*
of
an
inequality
.
Her
own
plain
blue
dress
,
with
its
black
cotton
tape
*NL*
trimmings
,
now
seemed
to
her
shabby
.
She
felt
the
worn
state
of
her
*NL*
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
see
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
I
know
quite
a
number
of
people
in
your
town
.
*NL*
Morgenroth
the
clothier
and
Gibson
the
dry
goods
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
?
''
she
interrupted
,
aroused
by
memories
of
longings
their
*NL*
show
windows
had
cost
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
had
a
clew
to
her
interest
,
and
followed
it
deftly
.
In
a
few
*NL*
minutes
he
had
come
about
into
her
seat
.
He
talked
of
sales
of
clothing
,
*NL*
his
travels
,
Chicago
,
and
the
amusements
of
that
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
going
there
,
you
will
enjoy
it
immensely
.
Have
you
*NL*
relatives
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
visit
my
sister
,
''
she
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
see
Lincoln
Park
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
Michigan
Boulevard
.
They
*NL*
are
putting
up
great
buildings
there
.
It
's
a
second
New
York
--
great
.
So
*NL*
much
to
see
--
theatres
,
crowds
,
fine
houses
--
oh
,
you
'll
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
ache
in
her
fancy
of
all
he
described
.
Her
*NL*
insignificance
in
the
presence
of
so
much
magnificence
faintly
affected
*NL*
her
.
She
realised
that
hers
was
not
to
be
a
round
of
pleasure
,
and
yet
*NL*
there
was
something
promising
in
all
the
material
prospect
he
set
forth
.
*NL*
There
was
something
satisfactory
in
the
attention
of
this
individual
*NL*
with
his
good
clothes
.
She
could
not
help
smiling
as
he
told
her
of
some
*NL*
popular
actress
of
whom
she
reminded
him
.
She
was
not
silly
,
and
yet
*NL*
attention
of
this
sort
had
its
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
in
Chicago
some
little
time
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
he
observed
at
one
*NL*
turn
of
the
now
easy
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
vaguely
--
a
flash
vision
of
the
possibility
*NL*
of
her
not
securing
employment
rising
in
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Several
weeks
,
anyhow
,
''
he
said
,
looking
steadily
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
much
more
passing
now
than
the
mere
words
indicated
.
He
*NL*
recognised
the
indescribable
thing
that
made
up
for
fascination
and
*NL*
beauty
in
her
.
She
realised
that
she
was
of
interest
to
him
from
the
*NL*
one
standpoint
which
a
woman
both
delights
in
and
fears
.
Her
manner
was
*NL*
simple
,
though
for
the
very
reason
that
she
had
not
yet
learned
the
many
*NL*
little
affectations
with
which
women
conceal
their
true
feelings
.
Some
*NL*
things
she
did
appeared
bold
.
A
clever
companion
--
had
she
ever
had
*NL*
one
--
would
have
warned
her
never
to
look
a
man
in
the
eyes
so
steadily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
ask
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
going
to
be
there
several
weeks
.
I
'm
going
to
study
stock
at
*NL*
our
place
and
get
new
samples
.
I
might
show
you
`
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
can
or
not
.
I
mean
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
can
.
*NL*
I
shall
be
living
with
my
sister
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
she
minds
,
we
'll
fix
that
.
''
He
took
out
his
pencil
and
a
*NL*
little
pocket
note-book
as
if
it
were
all
settled
.
``
What
is
your
address
*NL*
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fumbled
her
purse
which
contained
the
address
slip
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
down
in
his
hip
pocket
and
took
out
a
fat
purse
.
It
was
*NL*
filled
with
slips
of
paper
,
some
mileage
books
,
a
roll
of
greenbacks
.
*NL*
It
impressed
her
deeply
.
Such
a
purse
had
never
been
carried
by
any
one
*NL*
attentive
to
her
.
Indeed
,
an
experienced
traveller
,
a
brisk
man
of
the
*NL*
world
,
had
never
come
within
such
close
range
before
.
The
purse
,
the
*NL*
shiny
tan
shoes
,
the
smart
new
suit
,
and
the
air
with
which
he
did
*NL*
things
,
built
up
for
her
a
dim
world
of
fortune
,
of
which
he
was
the
*NL*
centre
.
It
disposed
her
pleasantly
toward
all
he
might
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
out
a
neat
business
card
,
on
which
was
engraved
Bartlett
,
Caryoe
*NL*
&
Company
,
and
down
in
the
left-hand
corner
,
Chas
.
H.
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
me
,
''
he
said
,
putting
the
card
in
her
hand
and
touching
his
*NL*
name
.
``
It
's
pronounced
Drew-eh
.
Our
family
was
French
,
on
my
father
's
*NL*
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
it
while
he
put
up
his
purse
.
Then
he
got
out
a
letter
*NL*
from
a
bunch
in
his
coat
pocket
.
``
This
is
the
house
I
travel
for
,
''
he
*NL*
went
on
,
pointing
to
a
picture
on
it
,
``
corner
of
State
and
Lake
.
''
There
*NL*
was
pride
in
his
voice
.
He
felt
that
it
was
something
to
be
connected
*NL*
with
such
a
place
,
and
he
made
her
feel
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
address
?
''
he
began
again
,
fixing
his
pencil
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
Meeber
,
''
she
said
slowly
.
``
Three
hundred
and
fifty-four
West
Van
*NL*
Buren
Street
,
care
S.
C.
Hanson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wrote
it
carefully
down
and
got
out
the
purse
again
.
``
You
'll
be
at
*NL*
home
if
I
come
around
Monday
night
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
true
it
is
that
words
are
but
the
vague
shadows
of
the
volumes
we
*NL*
mean
.
Little
audible
links
,
they
are
,
chaining
together
great
inaudible
*NL*
feelings
and
purposes
.
Here
were
these
two
,
bandying
little
phrases
,
*NL*
drawing
purses
,
looking
at
cards
,
and
both
unconscious
of
how
*NL*
inarticulate
all
their
real
feelings
were
.
Neither
was
wise
enough
to
be
*NL*
sure
of
the
working
of
the
mind
of
the
other
.
He
could
not
tell
how
his
*NL*
luring
succeeded
.
She
could
not
realise
that
she
was
drifting
,
until
he
*NL*
secured
her
address
.
Now
she
felt
that
she
had
yielded
something
--
he
,
*NL*
that
he
had
gained
a
victory
.
Already
they
felt
that
they
were
somehow
*NL*
associated
.
Already
he
took
control
in
directing
the
conversation
.
His
*NL*
words
were
easy
.
Her
manner
was
relaxed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
nearing
Chicago
.
Signs
were
everywhere
numerous
.
Trains
*NL*
flashed
by
them
.
Across
wide
stretches
of
flat
,
open
prairie
they
could
*NL*
see
lines
of
telegraph
poles
stalking
across
the
fields
toward
the
great
*NL*
city
.
Far
away
were
indications
of
suburban
towns
,
some
big
smokestacks
*NL*
towering
high
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frequently
there
were
two-story
frame
houses
standing
out
in
the
open
*NL*
fields
,
without
fence
or
trees
,
lone
outposts
of
the
approaching
army
of
*NL*
homes
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
child
,
the
genius
with
imagination
,
or
the
wholly
untravelled
,
*NL*
the
approach
to
a
great
city
for
the
first
time
is
a
wonderful
thing
.
*NL*
Particularly
if
it
be
evening
--
that
mystic
period
between
the
glare
and
*NL*
gloom
of
the
world
when
life
is
changing
from
one
sphere
or
condition
*NL*
to
another
.
Ah
,
the
promise
of
the
night
.
What
does
it
not
hold
for
the
*NL*
weary
!
What
old
illusion
of
hope
is
not
here
forever
repeated
!
Says
the
*NL*
soul
of
the
toiler
to
itself
,
``
I
shall
soon
be
free
.
I
shall
be
in
the
*NL*
ways
and
the
hosts
of
the
merry
.
The
streets
,
the
lamps
,
the
lighted
*NL*
chamber
set
for
dining
,
are
for
me
.
The
theatre
,
the
halls
,
the
parties
,
*NL*
the
ways
of
rest
and
the
paths
of
song
--
these
are
mine
in
the
night
.
''
*NL*
Though
all
humanity
be
still
enclosed
in
the
shops
,
the
thrill
runs
*NL*
abroad
.
It
is
in
the
air
.
The
dullest
feel
something
which
they
may
not
*NL*
always
express
or
describe
.
It
is
the
lifting
of
the
burden
of
toil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sister
Carrie
gazed
out
of
the
window
.
Her
companion
,
affected
by
her
*NL*
wonder
,
so
contagious
are
all
things
,
felt
anew
some
interest
in
the
*NL*
city
and
pointed
out
its
marvels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Northwest
Chicago
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
This
is
the
Chicago
River
,
''
*NL*
and
he
pointed
to
a
little
muddy
creek
,
crowded
with
the
huge
masted
*NL*
wanderers
from
far-off
waters
nosing
the
black-posted
banks
.
With
a
*NL*
puff
,
a
clang
,
and
a
clatter
of
rails
it
was
gone
.
``
Chicago
is
getting
*NL*
to
be
a
great
town
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
It
's
a
wonder
.
You
'll
find
lots
to
see
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
hear
this
very
well
.
Her
heart
was
troubled
by
a
kind
of
*NL*
terror
.
The
fact
that
she
was
alone
,
away
from
home
,
rushing
into
a
*NL*
great
sea
of
life
and
endeavour
,
began
to
tell
.
She
could
not
help
but
*NL*
feel
a
little
choked
for
breath
--
a
little
sick
as
her
heart
beat
so
*NL*
fast
.
She
half
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
think
it
was
nothing
,
that
*NL*
Columbia
City
was
only
a
little
way
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chicago
!
Chicago
!
''
called
the
brakeman
,
slamming
open
the
door
.
They
*NL*
were
rushing
into
a
more
crowded
yard
,
alive
with
the
clatter
and
clang
*NL*
of
life
.
She
began
to
gather
up
her
poor
little
grip
and
closed
her
hand
*NL*
firmly
upon
her
purse
.
Drouet
arose
,
kicked
his
legs
to
straighten
his
*NL*
trousers
,
and
seized
his
clean
yellow
grip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
your
people
will
be
here
to
meet
you
?
''
he
said
.
``
Let
me
carry
*NL*
your
grip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'd
rather
you
would
n't
.
I
'd
rather
you
would
n't
be
*NL*
with
me
when
I
meet
my
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
said
in
all
kindness
.
``
I
'll
be
near
,
though
,
in
case
she
*NL*
is
n't
here
,
and
take
you
out
there
safely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
so
kind
,
''
said
Carrie
,
feeling
the
goodness
of
such
attention
in
*NL*
her
strange
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chicago
!
''
called
the
brakeman
,
drawing
the
word
out
long
.
They
were
*NL*
under
a
great
shadowy
train
shed
,
where
the
lamps
were
already
beginning
*NL*
to
shine
out
,
with
passenger
cars
all
about
and
the
train
moving
at
a
*NL*
snail
's
pace
.
The
people
in
the
car
were
all
up
and
crowding
about
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
we
are
,
''
said
Drouet
,
leading
the
way
to
the
door
.
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
till
I
see
you
Monday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
she
answered
,
taking
his
proffered
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
I
'll
be
looking
till
you
find
your
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
into
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
filed
out
,
and
he
affected
to
take
no
notice
of
her
.
A
lean-faced
,
*NL*
rather
commonplace
woman
recognised
Carrie
on
the
platform
and
hurried
*NL*
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Sister
Carrie
!
''
she
began
,
and
there
was
embrace
of
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
realised
the
change
of
affectional
atmosphere
at
once
.
Amid
all
*NL*
the
maze
,
uproar
,
and
novelty
she
felt
cold
reality
taking
her
by
the
*NL*
hand
.
No
world
of
light
and
merriment
.
No
round
of
amusement
.
Her
sister
*NL*
carried
with
her
most
of
the
grimness
of
shift
and
toil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
are
all
the
folks
at
home
?
''
she
began
;
``
how
is
father
,
and
*NL*
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
answered
,
but
was
looking
away
.
Down
the
aisle
,
toward
the
gate
*NL*
leading
into
the
waiting-room
and
the
street
,
stood
Drouet
.
He
was
*NL*
looking
back
.
When
he
saw
that
she
saw
him
and
was
safe
with
her
sister
*NL*
he
turned
to
go
,
sending
back
the
shadow
of
a
smile
.
Only
Carrie
saw
it
.
*NL*
She
felt
something
lost
to
her
when
he
moved
away
.
When
he
disappeared
*NL*
she
felt
his
absence
thoroughly
.
With
her
sister
she
was
much
alone
,
a
*NL*
lone
figure
in
a
tossing
,
thoughtless
sea
.

WHAT
POVERTY
THREATENED
--
OF
GRANITE
AND
BRASS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
's
flat
,
as
the
one-floor
resident
apartments
were
then
being
*NL*
called
,
was
in
a
part
of
West
Van
Buren
Street
inhabited
by
families
of
*NL*
labourers
and
clerks
,
men
who
had
come
,
and
were
still
coming
,
with
the
*NL*
rush
of
population
pouring
in
at
the
rate
of
50,000
a
year
.
It
was
on
*NL*
the
third
floor
,
the
front
windows
looking
down
into
the
street
,
where
,
*NL*
at
night
,
the
lights
of
grocery
stores
were
shining
and
children
were
*NL*
playing
.
To
Carrie
,
the
sound
of
the
little
bells
upon
the
horse-cars
,
*NL*
as
they
tinkled
in
and
out
of
hearing
,
was
as
pleasing
as
it
was
novel
.
*NL*
She
gazed
into
the
lighted
street
when
Minnie
brought
her
into
the
front
*NL*
room
,
and
wondered
at
the
sounds
,
the
movement
,
the
murmur
of
the
vast
*NL*
city
which
stretched
for
miles
and
miles
in
every
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hanson
,
after
the
first
greetings
were
over
,
gave
Carrie
the
baby
*NL*
and
proceeded
to
get
supper
.
Her
husband
asked
a
few
questions
and
sat
*NL*
down
to
read
the
evening
paper
.
He
was
a
silent
man
,
American
born
,
of
a
*NL*
Swede
father
,
and
now
employed
as
a
cleaner
of
refrigerator
cars
at
the
*NL*
stock-yards
.
To
him
the
presence
or
absence
of
his
wife
's
sister
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
indifference
.
Her
personal
appearance
did
not
affect
him
one
*NL*
way
or
the
other
.
His
one
observation
to
the
point
was
concerning
the
*NL*
chances
of
work
in
Chicago
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
big
place
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
can
get
in
somewhere
in
a
few
days
.
*NL*
Everybody
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
tacitly
understood
beforehand
that
she
was
to
get
work
and
*NL*
pay
her
board
.
He
was
of
a
clean
,
saving
disposition
,
and
had
already
*NL*
paid
a
number
of
monthly
instalments
on
two
lots
far
out
on
the
West
*NL*
Side
.
His
ambition
was
some
day
to
build
a
house
on
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
interval
which
marked
the
preparation
of
the
meal
Carrie
found
*NL*
time
to
study
the
flat
.
She
had
some
slight
gift
of
observation
and
that
*NL*
sense
,
so
rich
in
every
woman
--
intuition
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
the
drag
of
a
lean
and
narrow
life
.
The
walls
of
the
rooms
were
*NL*
discordantly
papered
.
The
floors
were
covered
with
matting
and
the
hall
*NL*
laid
with
a
thin
rag
carpet
.
One
could
see
that
the
furniture
was
of
*NL*
that
poor
,
hurriedly
patched
together
quality
sold
by
the
instalment
*NL*
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
with
Minnie
,
in
the
kitchen
,
holding
the
baby
until
it
began
*NL*
to
cry
.
Then
she
walked
and
sang
to
it
,
until
Hanson
,
disturbed
in
his
*NL*
reading
,
came
and
took
it
.
A
pleasant
side
to
his
nature
came
out
here
.
*NL*
He
was
patient
.
One
could
see
that
he
was
very
much
wrapped
up
in
his
*NL*
offspring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
now
,
''
he
said
,
walking
.
``
There
,
there
,
''
and
there
was
a
certain
*NL*
Swedish
accent
noticeable
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
want
to
see
the
city
first
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
said
Minnie
,
when
they
*NL*
were
eating
.
``
Well
,
we
'll
go
out
Sunday
and
see
Lincoln
Park
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
noticed
that
Hanson
had
said
nothing
to
this
.
He
seemed
to
be
*NL*
thinking
of
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
think
I
'll
look
around
tomorrow
.
I
've
got
Friday
*NL*
and
Saturday
,
and
it
wo
n't
be
any
trouble
.
Which
way
is
the
business
*NL*
part
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
began
to
explain
,
but
her
husband
took
this
part
of
the
*NL*
conversation
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
that
way
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
east
.
``
That
's
east
.
''
Then
he
went
off
*NL*
into
the
longest
speech
he
had
yet
indulged
in
,
concerning
the
lay
of
*NL*
Chicago
.
``
You
'd
better
look
in
those
big
manufacturing
houses
along
*NL*
Franklin
Street
and
just
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
''
he
concluded
.
*NL*
``
Lots
of
girls
work
there
.
You
could
get
home
easy
,
too
.
It
is
n't
very
*NL*
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
nodded
and
asked
her
sister
about
the
neighbourhood
.
The
latter
*NL*
talked
in
a
subdued
tone
,
telling
the
little
she
knew
about
it
,
while
*NL*
Hanson
concerned
himself
with
the
baby
.
Finally
he
jumped
up
and
handed
*NL*
the
child
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
to
get
up
early
in
the
morning
,
so
I
'll
go
to
bed
,
''
and
off
*NL*
he
went
,
disappearing
into
the
dark
little
bedroom
off
the
hall
,
for
the
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
works
way
down
at
the
stock-yards
,
''
explained
Minnie
,
``
so
he
's
got
*NL*
to
get
up
at
half-past
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
do
you
get
up
to
get
breakfast
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
about
twenty
minutes
of
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Together
they
finished
the
labour
of
the
day
,
Carrie
washing
the
dishes
*NL*
while
Minnie
undressed
the
baby
and
put
it
to
bed
.
Minnie
's
manner
was
*NL*
one
of
trained
industry
,
and
Carrie
could
see
that
it
was
a
steady
round
*NL*
of
toil
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
see
that
her
relations
with
Drouet
would
have
to
be
*NL*
abandoned
.
He
could
not
come
here
.
She
read
from
the
manner
of
Hanson
,
*NL*
in
the
subdued
air
of
Minnie
,
and
,
indeed
,
the
whole
atmosphere
of
the
*NL*
flat
,
a
settled
opposition
to
anything
save
a
conservative
round
of
*NL*
toil
.
If
Hanson
sat
every
evening
in
the
front
room
and
read
his
paper
,
*NL*
if
he
went
to
bed
at
nine
,
and
Minnie
a
little
later
,
what
would
*NL*
they
expect
of
her
?
She
saw
that
she
would
first
need
to
get
work
and
*NL*
establish
herself
on
a
paying
basis
before
she
could
think
of
having
*NL*
company
of
any
sort
.
Her
little
flirtation
with
Drouet
seemed
now
an
*NL*
extraordinary
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
``
he
ca
n't
come
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
asked
Minnie
for
ink
and
paper
,
which
were
upon
the
mantel
in
*NL*
the
dining-room
,
and
when
the
latter
had
gone
to
bed
at
ten
,
got
out
*NL*
Drouet
's
card
and
wrote
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
have
you
call
on
me
here
.
You
will
have
to
wait
until
you
hear
*NL*
from
me
again
.
My
sister
's
place
is
so
small
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
troubled
herself
over
what
else
to
put
in
the
letter
.
She
wanted
*NL*
to
make
some
reference
to
their
relations
upon
the
train
,
but
was
too
*NL*
timid
.
She
concluded
by
thanking
him
for
his
kindness
in
a
crude
way
,
*NL*
then
puzzled
over
the
formality
of
signing
her
name
,
and
finally
decided
*NL*
upon
the
severe
,
winding
up
with
a
``
Very
truly
,
''
which
she
subsequently
*NL*
changed
to
``
Sincerely
.
''
She
scaled
and
addressed
the
letter
,
and
going
*NL*
in
the
front
room
,
the
alcove
of
which
contained
her
bed
,
drew
the
one
*NL*
small
rocking-chair
up
to
the
open
window
,
and
sat
looking
out
upon
*NL*
the
night
and
streets
in
silent
wonder
.
Finally
,
wearied
by
her
own
*NL*
reflections
,
she
began
to
grow
dull
in
her
chair
,
and
feeling
the
need
*NL*
of
sleep
,
arranged
her
clothing
for
the
night
and
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
awoke
at
eight
the
next
morning
,
Hanson
had
gone
.
Her
sister
*NL*
was
busy
in
the
dining-room
,
which
was
also
the
sitting-room
,
sewing
.
*NL*
She
worked
,
after
dressing
,
to
arrange
a
little
breakfast
for
herself
,
*NL*
and
then
advised
with
Minnie
as
to
which
way
to
look
.
The
latter
had
*NL*
changed
considerably
since
Carrie
had
seen
her
.
She
was
now
a
thin
,
*NL*
though
rugged
,
woman
of
twenty-seven
,
with
ideas
of
life
coloured
by
her
*NL*
husband
's
,
and
fast
hardening
into
narrower
conceptions
of
pleasure
and
*NL*
duty
than
had
ever
been
hers
in
a
thoroughly
circumscribed
youth
.
She
*NL*
had
invited
Carrie
,
not
because
she
longed
for
her
presence
,
but
because
*NL*
the
latter
was
dissatisfied
at
home
,
and
could
probably
get
work
and
pay
*NL*
her
board
here
.
She
was
pleased
to
see
her
in
a
way
but
reflected
her
*NL*
husband
's
point
of
view
in
the
matter
of
work
.
Anything
was
good
enough
*NL*
so
long
as
it
paid
--
say
,
five
dollars
a
week
to
begin
with
.
A
shop
girl
*NL*
was
the
destiny
prefigured
for
the
newcomer
.
She
would
get
in
one
of
the
*NL*
great
shops
and
do
well
enough
until
--
well
,
until
something
happened
.
*NL*
Neither
of
them
knew
exactly
what
.
They
did
not
figure
on
promotion
.
*NL*
They
did
not
exactly
count
on
marriage
.
Things
would
go
on
,
though
,
in
a
*NL*
dim
kind
of
way
until
the
better
thing
would
eventuate
,
and
Carrie
*NL*
would
be
rewarded
for
coming
and
toiling
in
the
city
.
It
was
under
such
*NL*
auspicious
circumstances
that
she
started
out
this
morning
to
look
for
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
following
her
in
her
round
of
seeking
,
let
us
look
at
the
*NL*
sphere
in
which
her
future
was
to
lie
.
In
1889
Chicago
had
the
peculiar
*NL*
qualifications
of
growth
which
made
such
adventuresome
pilgrimages
even
*NL*
on
the
part
of
young
girls
plausible
.
Its
many
and
growing
commercial
*NL*
opportunities
gave
it
widespread
fame
,
which
made
of
it
a
giant
*NL*
magnet
,
drawing
to
itself
,
from
all
quarters
,
the
hopeful
and
the
*NL*
hopeless
--
those
who
had
their
fortune
yet
to
make
and
those
whose
*NL*
fortunes
and
affairs
had
reached
a
disastrous
climax
elsewhere
.
It
was
*NL*
a
city
of
over
500,000
,
with
the
ambition
,
the
daring
,
the
activity
of
*NL*
a
metropolis
of
a
million
.
Its
streets
and
houses
were
already
scattered
*NL*
over
an
area
of
seventy-five
square
miles
.
Its
population
was
not
so
*NL*
much
thriving
upon
established
commerce
as
upon
the
industries
which
*NL*
prepared
for
the
arrival
of
others
.
The
sound
of
the
hammer
engaged
upon
*NL*
the
erection
of
new
structures
was
everywhere
heard
.
Great
industries
*NL*
were
moving
in
.
The
huge
railroad
corporations
which
had
long
before
*NL*
recognised
the
prospects
of
the
place
had
seized
upon
vast
tracts
of
*NL*
land
for
transfer
and
shipping
purposes
.
Street-car
lines
had
been
*NL*
extended
far
out
into
the
open
country
in
anticipation
of
rapid
growth
.
*NL*
The
city
had
laid
miles
and
miles
of
streets
and
sewers
through
regions
*NL*
where
,
perhaps
,
one
solitary
house
stood
out
alone
--
a
pioneer
of
the
*NL*
populous
ways
to
be
.
There
were
regions
open
to
the
sweeping
winds
and
*NL*
rain
,
which
were
yet
lighted
throughout
the
night
with
long
,
blinking
*NL*
lines
of
gas-lamps
,
fluttering
in
the
wind
.
Narrow
board
walks
extended
*NL*
out
,
passing
here
a
house
,
and
there
a
store
,
at
far
intervals
,
*NL*
eventually
ending
on
the
open
prairie
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
central
portion
was
the
vast
wholesale
and
shopping
district
,
*NL*
to
which
the
uninformed
seeker
for
work
usually
drifted
.
It
was
a
*NL*
characteristic
of
Chicago
then
,
and
one
not
generally
shared
by
other
*NL*
cities
,
that
individual
firms
of
any
pretension
occupied
individual
*NL*
buildings
.
The
presence
of
ample
ground
made
this
possible
.
It
gave
an
*NL*
imposing
appearance
to
most
of
the
wholesale
houses
,
whose
offices
were
*NL*
upon
the
ground
floor
and
in
plain
view
of
the
street
.
The
large
plates
*NL*
of
window
glass
,
now
so
common
,
were
then
rapidly
coming
into
use
,
and
*NL*
gave
to
the
ground
floor
offices
a
distinguished
and
prosperous
look
.
*NL*
The
casual
wanderer
could
see
as
he
passed
a
polished
array
of
*NL*
office
fixtures
,
much
frosted
glass
,
clerks
hard
at
work
,
and
genteel
*NL*
businessmen
in
``
nobby
''
suits
and
clean
linen
lounging
about
or
sitting
*NL*
in
groups
.
Polished
brass
or
nickel
signs
at
the
square
stone
entrances
*NL*
announced
the
firm
and
the
nature
of
the
business
in
rather
neat
and
*NL*
reserved
terms
.
The
entire
metropolitan
centre
possessed
a
high
and
*NL*
mighty
air
calculated
to
overawe
and
abash
the
common
applicant
,
and
to
*NL*
make
the
gulf
between
poverty
and
success
seem
both
wide
and
deep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Into
this
important
commercial
region
the
timid
Carrie
went
.
She
walked
*NL*
east
along
Van
Buren
Street
through
a
region
of
lessening
importance
,
*NL*
until
it
deteriorated
into
a
mass
of
shanties
and
coal-yards
,
and
*NL*
finally
verged
upon
the
river
.
She
walked
bravely
forward
,
led
by
*NL*
an
honest
desire
to
find
employment
and
delayed
at
every
step
by
the
*NL*
interest
of
the
unfolding
scene
,
and
a
sense
of
helplessness
amid
so
*NL*
much
evidence
of
power
and
force
which
she
did
not
understand
.
These
*NL*
vast
buildings
,
what
were
they
?
These
strange
energies
and
huge
*NL*
interests
,
for
what
purposes
were
they
there
?
She
could
have
understood
*NL*
the
meaning
of
a
little
stone-cutter
's
yard
at
Columbia
City
,
carving
*NL*
little
pieces
of
marble
for
individual
use
,
but
when
the
yards
of
some
*NL*
huge
stone
corporation
came
into
view
,
filled
with
spur
tracks
and
flat
*NL*
cars
,
transpierced
by
docks
from
the
river
and
traversed
overhead
by
*NL*
immense
trundling
cranes
of
wood
and
steel
,
it
lost
all
significance
in
*NL*
her
little
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
with
the
vast
railroad
yards
,
with
the
crowded
array
of
*NL*
vessels
she
saw
at
the
river
,
and
the
huge
factories
over
the
way
,
*NL*
lining
the
water
's
edge
.
Through
the
open
windows
she
could
see
the
*NL*
figures
of
men
and
women
in
working
aprons
,
moving
busily
about
.
The
*NL*
great
streets
were
wall-lined
mysteries
to
her
;
the
vast
offices
,
*NL*
strange
mazes
which
concerned
far-off
individuals
of
importance
.
She
*NL*
could
only
think
of
people
connected
with
them
as
counting
money
,
*NL*
dressing
magnificently
,
and
riding
in
carriages
.
What
they
dealt
in
,
*NL*
how
they
laboured
,
to
what
end
it
all
came
,
she
had
only
the
vaguest
*NL*
conception
.
It
was
all
wonderful
,
all
vast
,
all
far
removed
,
and
she
*NL*
sank
in
spirit
inwardly
and
fluttered
feebly
at
the
heart
as
she
thought
*NL*
of
entering
any
one
of
these
mighty
concerns
and
asking
for
something
to
*NL*
do
--
something
that
she
could
do
--
anything
.

WEE
QUESTION
OF
FORTUNE
--
FOUR-FIFTY
A
WEEK
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Once
across
the
river
and
into
the
wholesale
district
,
she
glanced
about
*NL*
her
for
some
likely
door
at
which
to
apply
.
As
she
contemplated
the
wide
*NL*
windows
and
imposing
signs
,
she
became
conscious
of
being
gazed
upon
*NL*
and
understood
for
what
she
was
--
a
wage-seeker
.
She
had
never
done
this
*NL*
thing
before
,
and
lacked
courage
.
To
avoid
a
certain
indefinable
shame
*NL*
she
felt
at
being
caught
spying
about
for
a
position
,
she
quickened
her
*NL*
steps
and
assumed
an
air
of
indifference
supposedly
common
to
one
upon
*NL*
an
errand
.
In
this
way
she
passed
many
manufacturing
and
wholesale
*NL*
houses
without
once
glancing
in
.
At
last
,
after
several
blocks
of
*NL*
walking
,
she
felt
that
this
would
not
do
,
and
began
to
look
about
again
,
*NL*
though
without
relaxing
her
pace
.
A
little
way
on
she
saw
a
great
door
*NL*
which
,
for
some
reason
,
attracted
her
attention
.
It
was
ornamented
by
a
*NL*
small
brass
sign
,
and
seemed
to
be
the
entrance
to
a
vast
hive
of
six
*NL*
or
seven
floors
.
``
Perhaps
,
''
she
thought
,
``
they
may
want
some
one
,
''
*NL*
and
crossed
over
to
enter
.
When
she
came
within
a
score
of
feet
of
the
*NL*
desired
goal
,
she
saw
through
the
window
a
young
man
in
a
grey
checked
*NL*
suit
.
That
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
concern
,
she
could
not
tell
,
*NL*
but
because
he
happened
to
be
looking
in
her
direction
her
weakening
*NL*
heart
misgave
her
and
she
hurried
by
,
too
overcome
with
shame
to
enter
.
*NL*
Over
the
way
stood
a
great
six-story
structure
,
labelled
Storm
and
King
,
*NL*
which
she
viewed
with
rising
hope
.
It
was
a
wholesale
dry
goods
concern
*NL*
and
employed
women
.
She
could
see
them
moving
about
now
and
then
upon
*NL*
the
upper
floors
.
This
place
she
decided
to
enter
,
no
matter
what
.
She
*NL*
crossed
over
and
walked
directly
toward
the
entrance
.
As
she
did
so
,
*NL*
two
men
came
out
and
paused
in
the
door
.
A
telegraph
messenger
in
*NL*
blue
dashed
past
her
and
up
the
few
steps
that
led
to
the
entrance
and
*NL*
disappeared
.
Several
pedestrians
out
of
the
hurrying
throng
which
filled
*NL*
the
sidewalks
passed
about
her
as
she
paused
,
hesitating
.
She
looked
*NL*
helplessly
around
,
and
then
,
seeing
herself
observed
,
retreated
.
It
was
*NL*
too
difficult
a
task
.
She
could
not
go
past
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
severe
a
defeat
told
sadly
upon
her
nerves
.
Her
feet
carried
her
*NL*
mechanically
forward
,
every
foot
of
her
progress
being
a
satisfactory
*NL*
portion
of
a
flight
which
she
gladly
made
.
Block
after
block
passed
by
.
*NL*
Upon
streetlamps
at
the
various
corners
she
read
names
such
as
Madison
,
*NL*
Monroe
,
La
Salle
,
Clark
,
Dearborn
,
State
,
and
still
she
went
,
her
feet
*NL*
beginning
to
tire
upon
the
broad
stone
flagging
.
She
was
pleased
in
part
*NL*
that
the
streets
were
bright
and
clean
.
The
morning
sun
,
shining
down
*NL*
with
steadily
increasing
warmth
,
made
the
shady
side
of
the
streets
*NL*
pleasantly
cool
.
She
looked
at
the
blue
sky
overhead
with
more
*NL*
realisation
of
its
charm
than
had
ever
come
to
her
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
cowardice
began
to
trouble
her
in
a
way
.
She
turned
back
,
resolving
*NL*
to
hunt
up
Storm
and
King
and
enter
.
On
the
way
,
she
encountered
a
great
*NL*
wholesale
shoe
company
,
through
the
broad
plate
windows
of
which
she
saw
*NL*
an
enclosed
executive
department
,
hidden
by
frosted
glass
.
Without
*NL*
this
enclosure
,
but
just
within
the
street
entrance
,
sat
a
grey-haired
*NL*
gentleman
at
a
small
table
,
with
a
large
open
ledger
before
him
.
She
*NL*
walked
by
this
institution
several
times
hesitating
,
but
,
finding
*NL*
herself
unobserved
,
faltered
past
the
screen
door
and
stood
humble
*NL*
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
young
lady
,
''
observed
the
old
gentleman
,
looking
at
her
somewhat
*NL*
kindly
,
``
what
is
it
you
wish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
that
is
,
do
you
--
I
mean
,
do
you
need
any
help
?
''
she
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
just
at
present
,
''
he
answered
smiling
.
``
Not
just
at
present
.
Come
*NL*
in
some
time
next
week
.
Occasionally
we
need
some
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
received
the
answer
in
silence
and
backed
awkwardly
out
.
The
*NL*
pleasant
nature
of
her
reception
rather
astonished
her
.
She
had
expected
*NL*
that
it
would
be
more
difficult
,
that
something
cold
and
harsh
would
be
*NL*
said
--
she
knew
not
what
.
That
she
had
not
been
put
to
shame
and
made
to
*NL*
feel
her
unfortunate
position
,
seemed
remarkable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somewhat
encouraged
,
she
ventured
into
another
large
structure
.
It
was
a
*NL*
clothing
company
,
and
more
people
were
in
evidence
--
well-dressed
men
of
*NL*
forty
and
more
,
surrounded
by
brass
railings
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
office
boy
approached
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
you
wish
to
see
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
the
manager
,
''
she
said
.
He
ran
away
and
spoke
to
one
of
*NL*
a
group
of
three
men
who
were
conferring
together
.
One
of
these
came
*NL*
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
said
coldly
.
The
greeting
drove
all
courage
from
her
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
need
any
help
?
''
she
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
replied
abruptly
,
and
turned
upon
his
heel
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
foolishly
out
,
the
office
boy
deferentially
swinging
the
door
*NL*
for
her
,
and
gladly
sank
into
the
obscuring
crowd
.
It
was
a
severe
*NL*
setback
to
her
recently
pleased
mental
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
walked
quite
aimlessly
for
a
time
,
turning
here
and
there
,
*NL*
seeing
one
great
company
after
another
,
but
finding
no
courage
to
*NL*
prosecute
her
single
inquiry
.
High
noon
came
,
and
with
it
hunger
.
She
*NL*
hunted
out
an
unassuming
restaurant
and
entered
,
but
was
disturbed
to
*NL*
find
that
the
prices
were
exorbitant
for
the
size
of
her
purse
.
A
bowl
*NL*
of
soup
was
all
that
she
could
afford
,
and
,
with
this
quickly
eaten
,
*NL*
she
went
out
again
.
It
restored
her
strength
somewhat
and
made
her
*NL*
moderately
bold
to
pursue
the
search
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
walking
a
few
blocks
to
fix
upon
some
probable
place
,
she
again
*NL*
encountered
the
firm
of
Storm
and
King
,
and
this
time
managed
to
get
in
.
*NL*
Some
gentlemen
were
conferring
close
at
hand
,
but
took
no
notice
of
her
.
*NL*
She
was
left
standing
,
gazing
nervously
upon
the
floor
.
When
the
limit
*NL*
of
her
distress
had
been
nearly
reached
,
she
was
beckoned
to
by
a
man
at
*NL*
one
of
the
many
desks
within
the
near-by
railing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
you
wish
to
see
?
''
he
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
any
one
,
if
you
please
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
am
looking
for
something
*NL*
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
want
to
see
Mr.
McManus
,
''
he
returned
.
``
Sit
down
,
''
and
he
*NL*
pointed
to
a
chair
against
the
neighbouring
wall
.
He
went
on
leisurely
*NL*
writing
,
until
after
a
time
a
short
,
stout
gentleman
came
in
from
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
McManus
,
''
called
the
man
at
the
desk
,
``
this
young
woman
wants
to
*NL*
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
short
gentleman
turned
about
towards
Carrie
,
and
she
arose
and
came
*NL*
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
do
for
you
,
miss
?
''
he
inquired
,
surveying
her
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
know
if
I
can
get
a
position
,
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
what
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
anything
in
particular
,
''
she
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
had
any
experience
in
the
wholesale
dry
goods
business
?
''
*NL*
he
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
stenographer
or
typewriter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
``
Well
,
we
have
n't
anything
here
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
employ
only
*NL*
experienced
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
step
backward
toward
the
door
,
when
something
about
her
*NL*
plaintive
face
attracted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
worked
at
anything
before
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
it
's
hardly
possible
that
you
would
get
anything
to
do
in
a
*NL*
wholesale
house
of
this
kind
.
Have
you
tried
the
department
stores
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
acknowledged
that
she
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
I
were
you
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
her
rather
genially
,
``
I
would
*NL*
try
the
department
stores
.
They
often
need
young
women
as
clerks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
she
said
,
her
whole
nature
relieved
by
this
spark
of
*NL*
friendly
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
as
she
moved
toward
the
door
,
``
you
try
the
department
*NL*
stores
,
''
and
off
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
the
department
store
was
in
its
earliest
form
of
successful
*NL*
operation
,
and
there
were
not
many
.
The
first
three
in
the
United
*NL*
States
,
established
about
1884
,
were
in
Chicago
.
Carrie
was
familiar
*NL*
with
the
names
of
several
through
the
advertisements
in
the
``
Daily
*NL*
News
,
''
and
now
proceeded
to
seek
them
.
The
words
of
Mr.
McManus
had
*NL*
somehow
managed
to
restore
her
courage
,
which
had
fallen
low
,
and
she
*NL*
dared
to
hope
that
this
new
line
would
offer
her
something
.
Some
time
*NL*
she
spent
in
wandering
up
and
down
,
thinking
to
encounter
the
buildings
*NL*
by
chance
,
so
readily
is
the
mind
,
bent
upon
prosecuting
a
hard
but
*NL*
needful
errand
,
eased
by
that
self-deception
which
the
semblance
of
*NL*
search
,
without
the
reality
,
gives
.
At
last
she
inquired
of
a
police
*NL*
officer
,
and
was
directed
to
proceed
``
two
blocks
up
,
''
where
she
would
*NL*
find
``
The
Fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nature
of
these
vast
retail
combinations
,
should
they
ever
*NL*
permanently
disappear
,
will
form
an
interesting
chapter
in
the
*NL*
commercial
history
of
our
nation
.
Such
a
flowering
out
of
a
modest
trade
*NL*
principle
the
world
had
never
witnessed
up
to
that
time
.
They
were
along
*NL*
the
line
of
the
most
effective
retail
organisation
,
with
hundreds
of
*NL*
stores
coordinated
into
one
and
laid
out
upon
the
most
imposing
and
*NL*
economic
basis
.
They
were
handsome
,
bustling
,
successful
affairs
,
with
*NL*
a
host
of
clerks
and
a
swarm
of
patrons
.
Carrie
passed
along
the
busy
*NL*
aisles
,
much
affected
by
the
remarkable
displays
of
trinkets
,
dress
*NL*
goods
,
stationery
,
and
jewelry
.
Each
separate
counter
was
a
show
place
*NL*
of
dazzling
interest
and
attraction
.
She
could
not
help
feeling
the
*NL*
claim
of
each
trinket
and
valuable
upon
her
personally
,
and
yet
she
did
*NL*
not
stop
.
There
was
nothing
there
which
she
could
not
have
used
--
nothing
*NL*
which
she
did
not
long
to
own
.
The
dainty
slippers
and
stockings
,
*NL*
the
delicately
frilled
skirts
and
petticoats
,
the
laces
,
ribbons
,
*NL*
hair-combs
,
purses
,
all
touched
her
with
individual
desire
,
and
she
felt
*NL*
keenly
the
fact
that
not
any
of
these
things
were
in
the
range
of
her
*NL*
purchase
.
She
was
a
work-seeker
,
an
outcast
without
employment
,
one
whom
*NL*
the
average
employee
could
tell
at
a
glance
was
poor
and
in
need
of
a
*NL*
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
not
be
thought
that
any
one
could
have
mistaken
her
for
a
*NL*
nervous
,
sensitive
,
high-strung
nature
,
cast
unduly
upon
a
cold
,
*NL*
calculating
,
and
unpoetic
world
.
Such
certainly
she
was
not
.
But
women
*NL*
are
peculiarly
sensitive
to
their
adornment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
did
Carrie
feel
the
drag
of
desire
for
all
which
was
new
and
*NL*
pleasing
in
apparel
for
women
,
but
she
noticed
too
,
with
a
touch
at
the
*NL*
heart
,
the
fine
ladies
who
elbowed
and
ignored
her
,
brushing
past
in
*NL*
utter
disregard
of
her
presence
,
themselves
eagerly
enlisted
in
the
*NL*
materials
which
the
store
contained
.
Carrie
was
not
familiar
with
the
*NL*
appearance
of
her
more
fortunate
sisters
of
the
city
.
Neither
had
she
*NL*
before
known
the
nature
and
appearance
of
the
shop
girls
with
whom
she
*NL*
now
compared
poorly
.
They
were
pretty
in
the
main
,
some
even
handsome
,
*NL*
with
an
air
of
independence
and
indifference
which
added
,
in
the
case
of
*NL*
the
more
favoured
,
a
certain
piquancy
.
Their
clothes
were
neat
,
in
many
*NL*
instances
fine
,
and
wherever
she
encountered
the
eye
of
one
it
was
only
*NL*
to
recognise
in
it
a
keen
analysis
of
her
own
position
--
her
individual
*NL*
shortcomings
of
dress
and
that
shadow
of
manner
which
she
thought
must
*NL*
hang
about
her
and
make
clear
to
all
who
and
what
she
was
.
A
flame
of
*NL*
envy
lighted
in
her
heart
.
She
realised
in
a
dim
way
how
much
the
city
*NL*
held
--
wealth
,
fashion
,
ease
--
every
adornment
for
women
,
and
she
longed
*NL*
for
dress
and
beauty
with
a
whole
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
second
floor
were
the
managerial
offices
,
to
which
,
after
some
*NL*
inquiry
,
she
was
now
directed
.
There
she
found
other
girls
ahead
of
*NL*
her
,
applicants
like
herself
,
but
with
more
of
that
self-satisfied
*NL*
and
independent
air
which
experience
of
the
city
lends
;
girls
*NL*
who
scrutinised
her
in
a
painful
manner
.
After
a
wait
of
perhaps
*NL*
three-quarters
of
an
hour
,
she
was
called
in
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
a
sharp
,
quick-mannered
Jew
,
who
was
sitting
at
a
roll-top
*NL*
desk
near
the
window
,
``
have
you
ever
worked
in
any
other
store
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
have
n't
,
''
he
said
,
eyeing
her
keenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
prefer
young
women
just
now
with
some
experience
.
I
guess
we
*NL*
ca
n't
use
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
stood
waiting
a
moment
,
hardly
certain
whether
the
interview
had
*NL*
terminated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
wait
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Remember
we
are
very
busy
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
began
to
move
quickly
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
,
''
he
said
,
calling
her
back
.
``
Give
me
your
name
and
address
.
We
*NL*
want
girls
occasionally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
gotten
safely
into
the
street
,
she
could
scarcely
restrain
*NL*
the
tears
.
It
was
not
so
much
the
particular
rebuff
which
she
had
just
*NL*
experienced
,
but
the
whole
abashing
trend
of
the
day
.
She
was
tired
and
*NL*
nervous
.
She
abandoned
the
thought
of
appealing
to
the
other
department
*NL*
stores
and
now
wandered
on
,
feeling
a
certain
safety
and
relief
in
*NL*
mingling
with
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
indifferent
wandering
she
turned
into
Jackson
Street
,
not
far
*NL*
from
the
river
,
and
was
keeping
her
way
along
the
south
side
of
that
*NL*
imposing
thoroughfare
,
when
a
piece
of
wrapping
paper
,
written
on
with
*NL*
marking
ink
and
tacked
up
on
the
door
,
attracted
her
attention
.
It
*NL*
read
,
``
Girls
wanted
--
wrappers
&
stitchers
.
''
She
hesitated
a
moment
,
then
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
firm
of
Speigelheim
&
Co.
,
makers
of
boys
'
caps
,
occupied
one
floor
*NL*
of
the
building
,
fifty
feet
in
width
and
some
eighty
feet
in
depth
.
*NL*
It
was
a
place
rather
dingily
lighted
,
the
darkest
portions
having
*NL*
incandescent
lights
,
filled
with
machines
and
work
benches
.
At
the
*NL*
latter
laboured
quite
a
company
of
girls
and
some
men
.
The
former
were
*NL*
drabby-looking
creatures
,
stained
in
face
with
oil
and
dust
,
clad
in
*NL*
thin
,
shapeless
,
cotton
dresses
and
shod
with
more
or
less
worn
shoes
.
*NL*
Many
of
them
had
their
sleeves
rolled
up
,
revealing
bare
arms
,
and
in
*NL*
some
cases
,
owing
to
the
heat
,
their
dresses
were
open
at
the
neck
.
They
*NL*
were
a
fair
type
of
nearly
the
lowest
order
of
shop-girls
--
careless
,
*NL*
slouchy
,
and
more
or
less
pale
from
confinement
.
They
were
not
timid
,
*NL*
however
;
were
rich
in
curiosity
,
and
strong
in
daring
and
slang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
about
her
,
very
much
disturbed
and
quite
sure
that
she
did
*NL*
not
want
to
work
here
.
Aside
from
making
her
uncomfortable
by
sidelong
*NL*
glances
,
no
one
paid
her
the
least
attention
.
She
waited
until
the
whole
*NL*
department
was
aware
of
her
presence
.
Then
some
word
was
sent
around
,
*NL*
and
a
foreman
,
in
an
apron
and
shirt
sleeves
,
the
latter
rolled
up
to
*NL*
his
shoulders
,
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
see
me
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
need
any
help
?
''
said
Carrie
,
already
learning
directness
of
*NL*
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
how
to
stitch
caps
?
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
had
any
experience
at
this
kind
of
work
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
that
she
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
foreman
,
scratching
his
ear
meditatively
,
``
we
do
need
*NL*
a
stitcher
.
We
like
experienced
help
,
though
.
We
've
hardly
got
time
*NL*
to
break
people
in
.
''
He
paused
and
looked
away
out
of
the
window
.
``
We
*NL*
might
,
though
,
put
you
at
finishing
,
''
he
concluded
reflectively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
you
pay
a
week
?
''
ventured
Carrie
,
emboldened
by
a
certain
*NL*
softness
in
the
man
's
manner
and
his
simplicity
of
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
and
a
half
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
was
about
to
exclaim
,
but
checked
herself
and
allowed
her
*NL*
thoughts
to
die
without
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
not
exactly
in
need
of
anybody
,
''
he
went
on
vaguely
,
looking
her
*NL*
over
as
one
would
a
package
.
``
You
can
come
on
Monday
morning
,
though
,
''
*NL*
he
added
,
``
and
I
'll
put
you
to
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Carrie
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
come
,
bring
an
apron
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
away
and
left
her
standing
by
the
elevator
,
never
so
much
as
*NL*
inquiring
her
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
appearance
of
the
shop
and
the
announcement
of
the
price
paid
*NL*
per
week
operated
very
much
as
a
blow
to
Carrie
's
fancy
,
the
fact
that
*NL*
work
of
any
kind
was
offered
after
so
rude
a
round
of
experience
was
*NL*
gratifying
.
She
could
not
begin
to
believe
that
she
would
take
the
*NL*
place
,
modest
as
her
aspirations
were
.
She
had
been
used
to
better
than
*NL*
that
.
Her
mere
experience
and
the
free
out-of-door
life
of
the
country
*NL*
caused
her
nature
to
revolt
at
such
confinement
.
Dirt
had
never
been
her
*NL*
share
.
Her
sister
's
flat
was
clean
.
This
place
was
grimy
and
low
,
the
*NL*
girls
were
careless
and
hardened
.
They
must
be
bad-minded
and
hearted
,
*NL*
she
imagined
.
Still
,
a
place
had
been
offered
her
.
Surely
Chicago
*NL*
was
not
so
bad
if
she
could
find
one
place
in
one
day
.
She
might
find
*NL*
another
and
better
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
subsequent
experiences
were
not
of
a
reassuring
nature
,
however
.
*NL*
From
all
the
more
pleasing
or
imposing
places
she
was
turned
away
*NL*
abruptly
with
the
most
chilling
formality
.
In
others
where
she
applied
*NL*
only
the
experienced
were
required
.
She
met
with
painful
rebuffs
,
the
*NL*
most
trying
of
which
had
been
in
a
manufacturing
cloak
house
,
where
she
*NL*
had
gone
to
the
fourth
floor
to
inquire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
the
foreman
,
a
rough
,
heavily
built
individual
,
who
*NL*
looked
after
a
miserably
lighted
workshop
,
``
we
do
n't
want
any
one
.
Do
n't
*NL*
come
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
wane
of
the
afternoon
went
her
hopes
,
her
courage
,
and
her
*NL*
strength
.
She
had
been
astonishingly
persistent
.
So
earnest
an
effort
*NL*
was
well
deserving
of
a
better
reward
.
On
every
hand
,
to
her
fatigued
*NL*
senses
,
the
great
business
portion
grew
larger
,
harder
,
more
stolid
in
*NL*
its
indifference
.
It
seemed
as
if
it
was
all
closed
to
her
,
that
the
*NL*
struggle
was
too
fierce
for
her
to
hope
to
do
anything
at
all
.
Men
and
*NL*
women
hurried
by
in
long
,
shifting
lines
.
She
felt
the
flow
of
the
*NL*
tide
of
effort
and
interest
--
felt
her
own
helplessness
without
quite
*NL*
realising
the
wisp
on
the
tide
that
she
was
.
She
cast
about
vainly
*NL*
for
some
possible
place
to
apply
,
but
found
no
door
which
she
had
*NL*
the
courage
to
enter
.
It
would
be
the
same
thing
all
over
.
The
old
*NL*
humiliation
of
her
plea
,
rewarded
by
curt
denial
.
Sick
at
heart
and
in
*NL*
body
,
she
turned
to
the
west
,
the
direction
of
Minnie
's
flat
,
which
she
*NL*
had
now
fixed
in
mind
,
and
began
that
wearisome
,
baffled
retreat
which
*NL*
the
seeker
for
employment
at
nightfall
too
often
makes
.
In
passing
*NL*
through
Fifth
Avenue
,
south
towards
Van
Buren
Street
,
where
she
intended
*NL*
to
take
a
car
,
she
passed
the
door
of
a
large
wholesale
shoe
house
,
*NL*
through
the
plate-glass
windows
of
which
she
could
see
a
middle-aged
*NL*
gentleman
sitting
at
a
small
desk
.
One
of
those
forlorn
impulses
which
*NL*
often
grow
out
of
a
fixed
sense
of
defeat
,
the
last
sprouting
of
a
*NL*
baffled
and
uprooted
growth
of
ideas
,
seized
upon
her
.
She
walked
*NL*
deliberately
through
the
door
and
up
to
the
gentleman
,
who
looked
at
her
*NL*
weary
face
with
partially
awakened
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
give
me
something
to
do
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
really
do
n't
know
,
''
he
said
kindly
.
``
What
kind
of
work
is
it
you
*NL*
want
--
you
're
not
a
typewriter
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
only
employ
book-keepers
and
typewriters
here
.
You
might
*NL*
go
around
to
the
side
and
inquire
upstairs
.
They
did
want
some
help
*NL*
upstairs
a
few
days
ago
.
Ask
for
Mr.
Brown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hastened
around
to
the
side
entrance
and
was
taken
up
by
the
*NL*
elevator
to
the
fourth
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
Mr.
Brown
,
Willie
,
''
said
the
elevator
man
to
a
boy
near
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Willie
went
off
and
presently
returned
with
the
information
that
Mr.
*NL*
Brown
said
she
should
sit
down
and
that
he
would
be
around
in
a
little
*NL*
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
portion
of
the
stock
room
which
gave
no
idea
of
the
general
*NL*
character
of
the
place
,
and
Carrie
could
form
no
opinion
of
the
nature
*NL*
of
the
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
want
something
to
do
,
''
said
Mr.
Brown
,
after
he
inquired
*NL*
concerning
the
nature
of
her
errand
.
``
Have
you
ever
been
employed
in
a
*NL*
shoe
factory
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
he
inquired
,
and
being
informed
,
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
as
I
have
anything
for
you
.
Would
you
work
for
four
and
a
half
a
*NL*
week
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
too
worn
by
defeat
not
to
feel
that
it
was
considerable
.
She
*NL*
had
not
expected
that
he
would
offer
her
less
than
six
.
She
acquiesced
,
*NL*
however
,
and
he
took
her
name
and
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
finally
,
``
you
report
here
at
eight
o'clock
Monday
*NL*
morning
.
I
think
I
can
find
something
for
you
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
her
revived
by
the
possibilities
,
sure
that
she
had
found
*NL*
something
at
last
.
Instantly
the
blood
crept
warmly
over
her
body
.
*NL*
Her
nervous
tension
relaxed
.
She
walked
out
into
the
busy
street
and
*NL*
discovered
a
new
atmosphere
.
Behold
,
the
throng
was
moving
with
a
*NL*
lightsome
step
.
She
noticed
that
men
and
women
were
smiling
.
Scraps
of
*NL*
conversation
and
notes
of
laughter
floated
to
her
.
The
air
was
light
.
*NL*
People
were
already
pouring
out
of
the
buildings
,
their
labour
ended
*NL*
for
the
day
.
She
noticed
that
they
were
pleased
,
and
thoughts
of
her
*NL*
sister
's
home
and
the
meal
that
would
be
awaiting
her
quickened
her
*NL*
steps
.
She
hurried
on
,
tired
perhaps
,
but
no
longer
weary
of
foot
.
What
*NL*
would
not
Minnie
say
!
Ah
,
the
long
winter
in
Chicago
--
the
lights
,
the
*NL*
crowd
,
the
amusement
!
This
was
a
great
,
pleasing
metropolis
after
all
.
*NL*
Her
new
firm
was
a
goodly
institution
.
Its
windows
were
of
huge
plate
*NL*
glass
.
She
could
probably
do
well
there
.
Thoughts
of
Drouet
returned
--
of
*NL*
the
things
he
had
told
her
.
She
now
felt
that
life
was
better
,
that
it
*NL*
was
livelier
,
sprightlier
.
She
boarded
a
car
in
the
best
of
spirits
,
*NL*
feeling
her
blood
still
flowing
pleasantly
.
She
would
live
in
Chicago
,
*NL*
her
mind
kept
saying
to
itself
.
She
would
have
a
better
time
than
she
*NL*
had
ever
had
before
--
she
would
be
happy
.

THE
SPENDINGS
OF
FANCY
--
FACTS
ANSWER
WITH
SNEERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
next
two
days
Carrie
indulged
in
the
most
high-flown
*NL*
speculations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
fancy
plunged
recklessly
into
privileges
and
amusements
which
would
*NL*
have
been
much
more
becoming
had
she
been
cradled
a
child
of
fortune
.
*NL*
With
ready
will
and
quick
mental
selection
she
scattered
her
meagre
*NL*
four-fifty
per
week
with
a
swift
and
graceful
hand
.
Indeed
,
as
she
sat
*NL*
in
her
rocking-chair
these
several
evenings
before
going
to
bed
and
*NL*
looked
out
upon
the
pleasantly
lighted
street
,
this
money
cleared
for
*NL*
its
prospective
possessor
the
way
to
every
joy
and
every
bauble
which
*NL*
the
heart
of
woman
may
desire
.
``
I
will
have
a
fine
time
,
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
sister
Minnie
knew
nothing
of
these
rather
wild
cerebrations
,
though
*NL*
they
exhausted
the
markets
of
delight
.
She
was
too
busy
scrubbing
the
*NL*
kitchen
woodwork
and
calculating
the
purchasing
power
of
eighty
cents
*NL*
for
Sunday
's
dinner
.
When
Carrie
had
returned
home
,
flushed
with
her
*NL*
first
success
and
ready
,
for
all
her
weariness
,
to
discuss
the
now
*NL*
interesting
events
which
led
up
to
her
achievement
,
the
former
had
*NL*
merely
smiled
approvingly
and
inquired
whether
she
would
have
to
spend
*NL*
any
of
it
for
car
fare
.
This
consideration
had
not
entered
in
before
,
*NL*
and
it
did
not
now
for
long
affect
the
glow
of
Carrie
's
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
Disposed
as
she
then
was
to
calculate
upon
that
vague
basis
which
*NL*
allows
the
subtraction
of
one
sum
from
another
without
any
perceptible
*NL*
diminution
,
she
was
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Hanson
came
home
at
seven
o'clock
,
he
was
inclined
to
be
a
little
*NL*
crusty
--
his
usual
demeanour
before
supper
.
This
never
showed
so
much
in
*NL*
anything
he
said
as
in
a
certain
solemnity
of
countenance
and
the
*NL*
silent
manner
in
which
he
slopped
about
.
He
had
a
pair
of
yellow
carpet
*NL*
slippers
which
he
enjoyed
wearing
,
and
these
he
would
immediately
*NL*
substitute
for
his
solid
pair
of
shoes
.
This
,
and
washing
his
face
with
*NL*
the
aid
of
common
washing
soap
until
it
glowed
a
shiny
red
,
constituted
*NL*
his
only
preparation
for
his
evening
meal
.
He
would
then
get
his
evening
*NL*
paper
and
read
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
young
man
,
this
was
rather
a
morbid
turn
of
character
,
and
so
*NL*
affected
Carrie
.
Indeed
,
it
affected
the
entire
atmosphere
of
the
flat
,
*NL*
as
such
things
are
inclined
to
do
,
and
gave
to
his
wife
's
mind
its
*NL*
subdued
and
tactful
turn
,
anxious
to
avoid
taciturn
replies
.
Under
the
*NL*
influence
of
Carrie
's
announcement
he
brightened
up
somewhat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
lose
any
time
,
did
you
?
''
he
remarked
,
smiling
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
returned
Carrie
with
a
touch
of
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
her
one
or
two
more
questions
and
then
turned
to
play
with
the
*NL*
baby
,
leaving
the
subject
until
it
was
brought
up
again
by
Minnie
at
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
,
however
,
was
not
to
be
reduced
to
the
common
level
of
*NL*
observation
which
prevailed
in
the
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
be
such
a
large
company
,
''
she
said
,
at
one
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
big
plate-glass
windows
and
lots
of
clerks
.
The
man
I
saw
said
*NL*
they
hired
ever
so
many
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
very
hard
to
get
work
now
,
''
put
in
Hanson
,
``
if
you
look
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
,
under
the
warming
influence
of
Carrie
's
good
spirits
and
her
*NL*
husband
's
somewhat
conversational
mood
,
began
to
tell
Carrie
of
some
*NL*
of
the
well-known
things
to
see
--
things
the
enjoyment
of
which
cost
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
like
to
see
Michigan
Avenue
.
There
are
such
fine
houses
.
It
is
*NL*
such
a
fine
street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
H.
R.
Jacob
's
?
''
interrupted
Carrie
,
mentioning
one
of
the
*NL*
theatres
devoted
to
melodrama
which
went
by
that
name
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
not
very
far
from
here
,
''
answered
Minnie
.
``
It
's
in
Halstead
*NL*
Street
,
right
up
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
'd
like
to
go
there
.
I
crossed
Halstead
Street
to-day
,
did
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
there
was
a
slight
halt
in
the
natural
reply
.
Thoughts
are
a
*NL*
strangely
permeating
factor
.
At
her
suggestion
of
going
to
the
theatre
,
*NL*
the
unspoken
shade
of
disapproval
to
the
doing
of
those
things
which
*NL*
involved
the
expenditure
of
money
--
shades
of
feeling
which
arose
in
the
*NL*
mind
of
Hanson
and
then
in
Minnie
--
slightly
affected
the
atmosphere
of
*NL*
the
table
.
Minnie
answered
``
yes
,
''
but
Carrie
could
feel
that
going
to
*NL*
the
theatre
was
poorly
advocated
here
.
The
subject
was
put
off
for
a
*NL*
little
while
until
Hanson
,
through
with
his
meal
,
took
his
paper
and
*NL*
went
into
the
front
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
alone
,
the
two
sisters
began
a
somewhat
freer
*NL*
conversation
,
Carrie
interrupting
it
to
hum
a
little
,
as
they
worked
at
*NL*
the
dishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
walk
up
and
see
Halstead
Street
,
if
it
is
n't
too
far
,
''
*NL*
said
Carrie
,
after
a
time
.
``
Why
do
n't
we
go
to
the
theatre
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
think
Sven
would
want
to
go
to-night
,
''
returned
Minnie
.
``
He
*NL*
has
to
get
up
so
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
mind
--
he
'd
enjoy
it
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
does
n't
go
very
often
,
''
returned
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'd
like
to
go
,
''
rejoined
Carrie
.
``
Let
's
you
and
me
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
pondered
a
while
,
not
upon
whether
she
could
or
would
go
--
for
*NL*
that
point
was
already
negatively
settled
with
her
--
but
upon
some
means
*NL*
of
diverting
the
thoughts
of
her
sister
to
some
other
topic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
some
other
time
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
finding
no
ready
means
of
*NL*
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
sensed
the
root
of
the
opposition
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
some
money
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
go
with
me
.
''
Minnie
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
could
go
along
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
returned
Minnie
softly
,
and
rattling
the
dishes
to
drown
the
*NL*
conversation
.
``
He
would
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
several
years
since
Minnie
had
seen
Carrie
,
and
in
that
time
*NL*
the
latter
's
character
had
developed
a
few
shades
.
Naturally
timid
in
*NL*
all
things
that
related
to
her
own
advancement
,
and
especially
so
when
*NL*
without
power
or
resource
,
her
craving
for
pleasure
was
so
strong
that
*NL*
it
was
the
one
stay
of
her
nature
.
She
would
speak
for
that
when
silent
*NL*
on
all
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
him
,
''
she
pleaded
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
was
thinking
of
the
resource
which
Carrie
's
board
would
add
.
It
*NL*
would
pay
the
rent
and
would
make
the
subject
of
expenditure
a
little
*NL*
less
difficult
to
talk
about
with
her
husband
.
But
if
Carrie
was
going
*NL*
to
think
of
running
around
in
the
beginning
there
would
be
a
hitch
*NL*
somewhere
.
Unless
Carrie
submitted
to
a
solemn
round
of
industry
and
saw
*NL*
the
need
of
hard
work
without
longing
for
play
,
how
was
her
coming
to
*NL*
the
city
to
profit
them
?
These
thoughts
were
not
those
of
a
cold
,
*NL*
hard
nature
at
all
.
They
were
the
serious
reflections
of
a
mind
*NL*
which
invariably
adjusted
itself
,
without
much
complaining
,
to
such
*NL*
surroundings
as
its
industry
could
make
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
she
yielded
enough
to
ask
Hanson
.
It
was
a
half-hearted
*NL*
procedure
without
a
shade
of
desire
on
her
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
wants
us
to
go
to
the
theatre
,
''
she
said
,
looking
in
upon
her
*NL*
husband
.
Hanson
looked
up
from
his
paper
,
and
they
exchanged
a
mild
*NL*
look
,
which
said
as
plainly
as
anything
:
``
This
is
n't
what
we
expected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
to
go
,
''
he
returned
.
``
What
does
she
want
to
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H.
R.
Jacob
's
,
''
said
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
down
at
his
paper
and
shook
his
head
negatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carrie
saw
how
they
looked
upon
her
proposition
,
she
gained
a
still
*NL*
clearer
feeling
of
their
way
of
life
.
It
weighed
on
her
,
but
took
no
*NL*
definite
form
of
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'll
go
down
and
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
after
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
made
no
objection
to
this
,
and
Carrie
put
on
her
hat
and
went
*NL*
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
has
Carrie
gone
?
''
asked
Hanson
,
coming
back
into
the
dining-room
*NL*
when
he
heard
the
door
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
she
was
going
down
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
''
answered
*NL*
Minnie
.
``
I
guess
she
just
wants
to
look
out
a
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ought
n't
to
be
thinking
about
spending
her
money
on
theatres
*NL*
already
,
do
you
think
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
just
feels
a
little
curious
,
I
guess
,
''
ventured
Minnie
.
``
Everything
*NL*
is
so
new
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Hanson
,
and
went
over
to
the
baby
,
his
forehead
*NL*
slightly
wrinkled
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thinking
of
a
full
career
of
vanity
and
wastefulness
which
a
*NL*
young
girl
might
indulge
in
,
and
wondering
how
Carrie
could
contemplate
*NL*
such
a
course
when
she
had
so
little
,
as
yet
,
with
which
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Saturday
Carrie
went
out
by
herself
--
first
toward
the
river
,
which
*NL*
interested
her
,
and
then
back
along
Jackson
Street
,
which
was
then
lined
*NL*
by
the
pretty
houses
and
fine
lawns
which
subsequently
caused
it
to
*NL*
be
made
into
a
boulevard
.
She
was
struck
with
the
evidences
of
wealth
,
*NL*
although
there
was
,
perhaps
,
not
a
person
on
the
street
worth
more
than
*NL*
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
.
She
was
glad
to
be
out
of
the
flat
,
because
*NL*
already
she
felt
that
it
was
a
narrow
,
humdrum
place
,
and
that
*NL*
interest
and
joy
lay
elsewhere
.
Her
thoughts
now
were
of
a
more
*NL*
liberal
character
,
and
she
punctuated
them
with
speculations
as
to
the
*NL*
whereabouts
of
Drouet
.
She
was
not
sure
but
that
he
might
call
anyhow
*NL*
Monday
night
,
and
,
while
she
felt
a
little
disturbed
at
the
possibility
,
*NL*
there
was
,
nevertheless
,
just
the
shade
of
a
wish
that
he
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Monday
she
arose
early
and
prepared
to
go
to
work
.
She
dressed
*NL*
herself
in
a
worn
shirt-waist
of
dotted
blue
percale
,
a
skirt
of
*NL*
light-brown
serge
rather
faded
,
and
a
small
straw
hat
which
she
had
worn
*NL*
all
summer
at
Columbia
City
.
Her
shoes
were
old
,
and
her
necktie
was
in
*NL*
that
crumpled
,
flattened
state
which
time
and
much
wearing
impart
.
*NL*
She
made
a
very
average
looking
shop-girl
with
the
exception
of
her
*NL*
features
.
These
were
slightly
more
even
than
common
,
and
gave
her
a
*NL*
sweet
,
reserved
,
and
pleasing
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
no
easy
thing
to
get
up
early
in
the
morning
when
one
is
used
to
*NL*
sleeping
until
seven
and
eight
,
as
Carrie
had
been
at
home
.
She
gained
*NL*
some
inkling
of
the
character
of
Hanson
's
life
when
,
half
asleep
,
she
*NL*
looked
out
into
the
dining-room
at
six
o'clock
and
saw
him
silently
*NL*
finishing
his
breakfast
.
By
the
time
she
was
dressed
he
was
gone
,
and
*NL*
she
,
Minnie
,
and
the
baby
ate
together
,
the
latter
being
just
old
enough
*NL*
to
sit
in
a
high
chair
and
disturb
the
dishes
with
a
spoon
.
Her
spirits
*NL*
were
greatly
subdued
now
when
the
fact
of
entering
upon
strange
and
*NL*
untried
duties
confronted
her
.
Only
the
ashes
of
all
her
fine
fancies
*NL*
were
remaining
--
ashes
still
concealing
,
nevertheless
,
a
few
red
embers
*NL*
of
hope
.
So
subdued
was
she
by
her
weakening
nerves
,
that
she
ate
quite
*NL*
in
silence
going
over
imaginary
conceptions
of
the
character
of
the
*NL*
shoe
company
,
the
nature
of
the
work
,
her
employer
's
attitude
.
She
was
*NL*
vaguely
feeling
that
she
would
come
in
contact
with
the
great
owners
,
*NL*
that
her
work
would
be
where
grave
,
stylishly
dressed
men
occasionally
*NL*
look
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good
luck
,
''
said
Minnie
,
when
she
was
ready
to
go
.
They
had
*NL*
agreed
it
was
best
to
walk
,
that
morning
at
least
,
to
see
if
she
could
*NL*
do
it
every
day
--
sixty
cents
a
week
for
car
fare
being
quite
an
item
*NL*
under
the
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
how
it
goes
to-night
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
in
the
sunlit
street
,
with
labourers
tramping
by
in
either
*NL*
direction
,
the
horse-cars
passing
crowded
to
the
rails
with
the
small
*NL*
clerks
and
floor
help
in
the
great
wholesale
houses
,
and
men
and
women
*NL*
generally
coming
out
of
doors
and
passing
about
the
neighbourhood
,
*NL*
Carrie
felt
slightly
reassured
.
In
the
sunshine
of
the
morning
,
beneath
*NL*
the
wide
,
blue
heavens
,
with
a
fresh
wind
astir
,
what
fears
,
except
*NL*
the
most
desperate
,
can
find
a
harbourage
?
In
the
night
,
or
the
gloomy
*NL*
chambers
of
the
day
,
fears
and
misgivings
wax
strong
,
but
out
in
the
*NL*
sunlight
there
is
,
for
a
time
,
cessation
even
of
the
terror
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
went
straight
forward
until
she
crossed
the
river
,
and
then
*NL*
turned
into
Fifth
Avenue
.
The
thoroughfare
,
in
this
part
,
was
like
a
*NL*
walled
canon
of
brown
stone
and
dark
red
brick
.
The
big
windows
looked
*NL*
shiny
and
clean
.
Trucks
were
rumbling
in
increasing
numbers
;
men
and
*NL*
women
,
girls
and
boys
were
moving
onward
in
all
directions
.
She
met
*NL*
girls
of
her
own
age
,
who
looked
at
her
as
if
with
contempt
for
her
*NL*
diffidence
.
She
wondered
at
the
magnitude
of
this
life
and
at
the
*NL*
importance
of
knowing
much
in
order
to
do
anything
in
it
at
all
.
Dread
*NL*
at
her
own
inefficiency
crept
upon
her
.
She
would
not
know
how
,
she
*NL*
would
not
be
quick
enough
.
Had
not
all
the
other
places
refused
her
*NL*
because
she
did
not
know
something
or
other
?
She
would
be
scolded
,
*NL*
abused
,
ignominiously
discharged
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
weak
knees
and
a
slight
catch
in
her
breathing
that
she
came
*NL*
up
to
the
great
shoe
company
at
Adams
and
Fifth
Avenue
and
entered
the
*NL*
elevator
.
When
she
stepped
out
on
the
fourth
floor
there
was
no
one
at
*NL*
hand
,
only
great
aisles
of
boxes
piled
to
the
ceiling
.
She
stood
,
very
*NL*
much
frightened
,
awaiting
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Mr.
Brown
came
up
.
He
did
not
seem
to
recognise
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
want
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
's
heart
sank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
I
should
come
this
morning
to
see
about
work
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
interrupted
.
``
Um
--
yes
.
What
is
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
Meeber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
.
``
You
come
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
led
the
way
through
dark
,
box-lined
aisles
which
had
the
smell
of
*NL*
new
shoes
,
until
they
came
to
an
iron
door
which
opened
into
the
factory
*NL*
proper
.
There
was
a
large
,
low-ceiled
room
,
with
clacking
,
rattling
*NL*
machines
at
which
men
in
white
shirt
sleeves
and
blue
gingham
aprons
*NL*
were
working
.
She
followed
him
diffidently
through
the
clattering
*NL*
automatons
,
keeping
her
eyes
straight
before
her
,
and
flushing
slightly
.
*NL*
They
crossed
to
a
far
corner
and
took
an
elevator
to
the
sixth
floor
.
*NL*
Out
of
the
array
of
machines
and
benches
,
Mr.
Brown
signalled
a
foreman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
girl
,
''
he
said
,
and
turning
to
Carrie
,
``
You
go
with
him
.
''
*NL*
He
then
returned
,
and
Carrie
followed
her
new
superior
to
a
little
desk
*NL*
in
a
corner
,
which
he
used
as
a
kind
of
official
centre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
never
worked
at
anything
like
this
before
,
have
you
?
''
he
*NL*
questioned
,
rather
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
rather
annoyed
at
having
to
bother
with
such
help
,
but
put
*NL*
down
her
name
and
then
led
her
across
to
where
a
line
of
girls
occupied
*NL*
stools
in
front
of
clacking
machines
.
On
the
shoulder
of
one
of
the
*NL*
girls
who
was
punching
eye-holes
in
one
piece
of
the
upper
,
by
the
aid
*NL*
of
the
machine
,
he
put
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
''
he
said
,
``
show
this
girl
how
to
do
what
you
're
doing
.
When
you
*NL*
get
through
,
come
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
so
addressed
rose
promptly
and
gave
Carrie
her
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
hard
to
do
,
''
she
said
,
bending
over
.
``
You
just
take
this
so
,
*NL*
fasten
it
with
this
clamp
,
and
start
the
machine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
suited
action
to
word
,
fastened
the
piece
of
leather
,
which
was
*NL*
eventually
to
form
the
right
half
of
the
upper
of
a
man
's
shoe
,
by
*NL*
little
adjustable
clamps
,
and
pushed
a
small
steel
rod
at
the
side
of
*NL*
the
machine
.
The
latter
jumped
to
the
task
of
punching
,
with
sharp
,
*NL*
snapping
clicks
,
cutting
circular
bits
of
leather
out
of
the
side
of
the
*NL*
upper
,
leaving
the
holes
which
were
to
hold
the
laces
.
After
observing
a
*NL*
few
times
,
the
girl
let
her
work
at
it
alone
.
Seeing
that
it
was
fairly
*NL*
well
done
,
she
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pieces
of
leather
came
from
the
girl
at
the
machine
to
her
right
,
*NL*
and
were
passed
on
to
the
girl
at
her
left
.
Carrie
saw
at
once
that
an
*NL*
average
speed
was
necessary
or
the
work
would
pile
up
on
her
and
all
*NL*
those
below
would
be
delayed
.
She
had
no
time
to
look
about
,
and
bent
*NL*
anxiously
to
her
task
.
The
girls
at
her
left
and
right
realised
her
*NL*
predicament
and
feelings
,
and
,
in
a
way
,
tried
to
aid
her
,
as
much
as
*NL*
they
dared
,
by
working
slower
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
task
she
laboured
incessantly
for
some
time
,
finding
relief
from
*NL*
her
own
nervous
fears
and
imaginings
in
the
humdrum
,
mechanical
movement
*NL*
of
the
machine
.
She
felt
,
as
the
minutes
passed
,
that
the
room
was
not
*NL*
very
light
.
It
had
a
thick
odour
of
fresh
leather
,
but
that
did
not
*NL*
worry
her
.
She
felt
the
eyes
of
the
other
help
upon
her
,
and
troubled
*NL*
lest
she
was
not
working
fast
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
when
she
was
fumbling
at
the
little
clamp
,
having
made
a
slight
*NL*
error
in
setting
in
the
leather
,
a
great
hand
appeared
before
her
eyes
*NL*
and
fastened
the
clamp
for
her
.
It
was
the
foreman
.
Her
heart
thumped
so
*NL*
that
she
could
scarcely
see
to
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Start
your
machine
,
''
he
said
,
``
start
your
machine
.
Do
n't
keep
the
line
*NL*
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
recovered
her
sufficiently
and
she
went
excitedly
on
,
hardly
*NL*
breathing
until
the
shadow
moved
away
from
behind
her
.
Then
she
heaved
a
*NL*
great
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
morning
wore
on
the
room
became
hotter
.
She
felt
the
need
of
a
*NL*
breath
of
fresh
air
and
a
drink
of
water
,
but
did
not
venture
to
stir
.
*NL*
The
stool
she
sat
on
was
without
a
back
or
foot-rest
,
and
she
began
to
*NL*
feel
uncomfortable
.
She
found
,
after
a
time
,
that
her
back
was
beginning
*NL*
to
ache
.
She
twisted
and
turned
from
one
position
to
another
slightly
*NL*
different
,
but
it
did
not
ease
her
for
long
.
She
was
beginning
to
weary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
up
,
why
do
n't
you
?
''
said
the
girl
at
her
right
,
without
any
form
*NL*
of
introduction
.
``
They
wo
n't
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
her
gratefully
.
``
I
guess
I
will
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
up
from
her
stool
and
worked
that
way
for
a
while
,
but
it
was
*NL*
a
more
difficult
position
.
Her
neck
and
shoulders
ached
in
bending
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirit
of
the
place
impressed
itself
on
her
in
a
rough
way
.
She
did
*NL*
not
venture
to
look
around
,
but
above
the
clack
of
the
machine
she
could
*NL*
hear
an
occasional
remark
.
She
could
also
note
a
thing
or
two
out
of
the
*NL*
side
of
her
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
Harry
last
night
?
''
said
the
girl
at
her
left
,
addressing
*NL*
her
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
seen
the
tie
he
had
on
.
Gee
,
but
he
was
a
mark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
S-s-t
,
''
said
the
other
girl
,
bending
over
her
work
.
The
first
,
*NL*
silenced
,
instantly
assumed
a
solemn
face
.
The
foreman
passed
slowly
*NL*
along
,
eyeing
each
worker
distinctly
.
The
moment
he
was
gone
,
the
*NL*
conversation
was
resumed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
began
the
girl
at
her
left
,
``
what
jeh
think
he
said
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
he
saw
us
with
Eddie
Harris
at
Martin
's
last
night
.
''
``
No
!
''
They
*NL*
both
giggled
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
youth
with
tan-coloured
hair
,
that
needed
clipping
very
badly
,
came
*NL*
shuffling
along
between
the
machines
,
bearing
a
basket
of
leather
*NL*
findings
under
his
left
arm
,
and
pressed
against
his
stomach
.
When
near
*NL*
Carrie
,
he
stretched
out
his
right
hand
and
gripped
one
girl
under
the
*NL*
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
,
let
me
go
,
''
she
exclaimed
angrily
.
``
Duffer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
grinned
broadly
in
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rubber
!
''
he
called
back
as
she
looked
after
him
.
There
was
nothing
of
*NL*
the
gallant
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
at
last
could
scarcely
sit
still
.
Her
legs
began
to
tire
and
she
*NL*
wanted
to
get
up
and
stretch
.
Would
noon
never
come
?
It
seemed
as
if
she
*NL*
had
worked
an
entire
day
.
She
was
not
hungry
at
all
,
but
weak
,
and
her
*NL*
eyes
were
tired
,
straining
at
the
one
point
where
the
eye-punch
came
*NL*
down
.
The
girl
at
the
right
noticed
her
squirmings
and
felt
sorry
for
*NL*
her
.
She
was
concentrating
herself
too
thoroughly
--
what
she
did
really
*NL*
required
less
mental
and
physical
strain
.
There
was
nothing
to
be
done
,
*NL*
however
.
The
halves
of
the
uppers
came
piling
steadily
down
.
Her
hands
*NL*
began
to
ache
at
the
wrists
and
then
in
the
fingers
,
and
towards
the
*NL*
last
she
seemed
one
mass
of
dull
,
complaining
muscles
,
fixed
in
an
*NL*
eternal
position
and
performing
a
single
mechanical
movement
which
*NL*
became
more
and
more
distasteful
,
until
as
last
it
was
absolutely
*NL*
nauseating
.
When
she
was
wondering
whether
the
strain
would
ever
cease
,
*NL*
a
dull-sounding
bell
clanged
somewhere
down
an
elevator
shaft
,
and
the
*NL*
end
came
.
In
an
instant
there
was
a
buzz
of
action
and
conversation
.
All
*NL*
the
girls
instantly
left
their
stools
and
hurried
away
in
an
adjoining
*NL*
room
,
men
passed
through
,
coming
from
some
department
which
opened
on
*NL*
the
right
.
The
whirling
wheels
began
to
sing
in
a
steadily
modifying
*NL*
key
,
until
at
last
they
died
away
in
a
low
buzz
.
There
was
an
audible
*NL*
stillness
,
in
which
the
common
voice
sounded
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
got
up
and
sought
her
lunch
box
.
She
was
stiff
,
a
little
dizzy
,
*NL*
and
very
thirsty
.
On
the
way
to
the
small
space
portioned
off
by
wood
,
*NL*
where
all
the
wraps
and
lunches
were
kept
,
she
encountered
the
foreman
,
*NL*
who
stared
at
her
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
did
you
get
along
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
''
she
replied
,
very
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Um
,
''
he
replied
,
for
want
of
something
better
,
and
walked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
better
material
conditions
,
this
kind
of
work
would
not
have
been
*NL*
so
bad
,
but
the
new
socialism
which
involves
pleasant
working
conditions
*NL*
for
employees
had
not
then
taken
hold
upon
manufacturing
companies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
smelled
of
the
oil
of
the
machines
and
the
new
leather
--
a
*NL*
combination
which
,
added
to
the
stale
odours
of
the
building
,
was
not
*NL*
pleasant
even
in
cold
weather
.
The
floor
,
though
regularly
swept
every
*NL*
evening
,
presented
a
littered
surface
.
Not
the
slightest
provision
*NL*
had
been
made
for
the
comfort
of
the
employees
,
the
idea
being
that
*NL*
something
was
gained
by
giving
them
as
little
and
making
the
work
*NL*
as
hard
and
unremunerative
as
possible
.
What
we
know
of
foot-rests
,
*NL*
swivel-back
chairs
,
dining-rooms
for
the
girls
,
clean
aprons
and
curling
*NL*
irons
supplied
free
,
and
a
decent
cloak
room
,
were
unthought
of
.
The
*NL*
washrooms
were
disagreeable
,
crude
,
if
not
foul
places
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
atmosphere
was
sordid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
about
her
,
after
she
had
drunk
a
tinful
of
water
from
a
*NL*
bucket
in
one
corner
,
for
a
place
to
sit
and
eat
.
The
other
girls
had
*NL*
ranged
themselves
about
the
windows
or
the
work-benches
of
those
of
the
*NL*
men
who
had
gone
out
.
She
saw
no
place
which
did
not
hold
a
couple
or
a
*NL*
group
of
girls
,
and
being
too
timid
to
think
of
intruding
herself
,
she
*NL*
sought
out
her
machine
and
,
seated
upon
her
stool
,
opened
her
lunch
on
*NL*
her
lap
.
There
she
sat
listening
to
the
chatter
and
comment
about
*NL*
her
.
It
was
,
for
the
most
part
,
silly
and
graced
by
the
current
slang
.
*NL*
Several
of
the
men
in
the
room
exchanged
compliments
with
the
girls
at
*NL*
long
range
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Kitty
,
''
called
one
to
a
girl
who
was
doing
a
waltz
step
in
a
few
*NL*
feet
of
space
near
one
of
the
windows
,
``
are
you
going
to
the
ball
with
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
,
Kitty
,
''
called
another
,
``
you
'll
jar
your
back
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
Rubber
,
''
was
her
only
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Carrie
listened
to
this
and
much
more
of
similar
familiar
badinage
*NL*
among
the
men
and
girls
,
she
instinctively
withdrew
into
herself
.
She
*NL*
was
not
used
to
this
type
,
and
felt
that
there
was
something
hard
and
*NL*
low
about
it
all
.
She
feared
that
the
young
boys
about
would
address
*NL*
such
remarks
to
her
--
boys
who
,
beside
Drouet
,
seemed
uncouth
and
*NL*
ridiculous
.
She
made
the
average
feminine
distinction
between
clothes
,
*NL*
putting
worth
,
goodness
,
and
distinction
in
a
dress
suit
,
and
leaving
*NL*
all
the
unlovely
qualities
and
those
beneath
notice
in
overalls
and
*NL*
jumper
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
glad
when
the
short
half
hour
was
over
and
the
wheels
began
to
*NL*
whirr
again
.
Though
wearied
,
she
would
be
inconspicuous
.
This
illusion
*NL*
ended
when
another
young
man
passed
along
the
aisle
and
poked
her
*NL*
indifferently
in
the
ribs
with
his
thumb
.
She
turned
about
,
indignation
*NL*
leaping
to
her
eyes
,
but
he
had
gone
on
and
only
once
turned
to
grin
.
*NL*
She
found
it
difficult
to
conquer
an
inclination
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
next
her
noticed
her
state
of
mind
.
``
Do
n't
you
mind
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
``
He
's
too
fresh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
said
nothing
,
but
bent
over
her
work
.
She
felt
as
though
she
*NL*
could
hardly
endure
such
a
life
.
Her
idea
of
work
had
been
so
entirely
*NL*
different
.
All
during
the
long
afternoon
she
thought
of
the
city
outside
*NL*
and
its
imposing
show
,
crowds
,
and
fine
buildings
.
Columbia
City
and
the
*NL*
better
side
of
her
home
life
came
back
.
By
three
o'clock
she
was
sure
it
*NL*
must
be
six
,
and
by
four
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
forgotten
to
note
the
*NL*
hour
and
were
letting
all
work
overtime
.
The
foreman
became
a
true
ogre
,
*NL*
prowling
constantly
about
,
keeping
her
tied
down
to
her
miserable
task
.
*NL*
What
she
heard
of
the
conversation
about
her
only
made
her
feel
sure
*NL*
that
she
did
not
want
to
make
friends
with
any
of
these
.
When
six
*NL*
o'clock
came
she
hurried
eagerly
away
,
her
arms
aching
and
her
limbs
*NL*
stiff
from
sitting
in
one
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
passed
out
along
the
hall
after
getting
her
hat
,
a
young
machine
*NL*
hand
,
attracted
by
her
looks
,
made
bold
to
jest
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Maggie
,
''
he
called
,
``
if
you
wait
,
I
'll
walk
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thrown
so
straight
in
her
direction
that
she
knew
who
was
meant
,
*NL*
but
never
turned
to
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
crowded
elevator
,
another
dusty
,
toil-stained
youth
tried
to
make
*NL*
an
impression
on
her
by
leering
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
young
man
,
waiting
on
the
walk
outside
for
the
appearance
of
*NL*
another
,
grinned
at
her
as
she
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
going
my
way
,
are
you
?
''
he
called
jocosely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
turned
her
face
to
the
west
with
a
subdued
heart
.
As
she
turned
*NL*
the
corner
,
she
saw
through
the
great
shiny
window
the
small
desk
at
*NL*
which
she
had
applied
.
There
were
the
crowds
,
hurrying
with
the
same
*NL*
buzz
and
energy-yielding
enthusiasm
.
She
felt
a
slight
relief
,
but
it
*NL*
was
only
at
her
escape
.
She
felt
ashamed
in
the
face
of
better
dressed
*NL*
girls
who
went
by
.
She
felt
as
though
she
should
be
better
served
,
and
*NL*
her
heart
revolted
.

A
GLITTERING
NIGHT
FLOWER
--
THE
USE
OF
A
NAME
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
did
not
call
that
evening
.
After
receiving
the
letter
,
he
had
*NL*
laid
aside
all
thought
of
Carrie
for
the
time
being
and
was
floating
*NL*
around
having
what
he
considered
a
gay
time
.
On
this
particular
evening
*NL*
he
dined
at
``
Rector
's
,
''
a
restaurant
of
some
local
fame
,
which
occupied
*NL*
a
basement
at
Clark
and
Monroe
Streets
.
There
--
after
he
visited
the
*NL*
resort
of
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
's
in
Adams
Street
,
opposite
the
imposing
*NL*
Federal
Building
.
There
he
leaned
over
the
splendid
bar
and
swallowed
a
*NL*
glass
of
plain
whiskey
and
purchased
a
couple
of
cigars
,
one
of
which
*NL*
he
lighted
.
This
to
him
represented
in
part
high
life
--
a
fair
sample
of
*NL*
what
the
whole
must
be
.
Drouet
was
not
a
drinker
in
excess
.
He
was
not
a
*NL*
moneyed
man
.
He
only
craved
the
best
,
as
his
mind
conceived
it
,
and
such
*NL*
doings
seemed
to
him
a
part
of
the
best
.

,
with
its
polished
*NL*
marble
walls
and
floor
,
its
profusion
of
lights
,
its
show
of
china
and
*NL*
silverware
,
and
,
above
all
,
its
reputation
as
a
resort
for
actors
and
*NL*
professional
men
,
seemed
to
him
the
proper
place
for
a
successful
man
to
*NL*
go
.
He
loved
fine
clothes
,
good
eating
,
and
particularly
the
company
and
*NL*
acquaintanceship
of
successful
men
.
When
dining
,
it
was
a
source
of
keen
*NL*
satisfaction
to
him
to
know
that
Joseph
Jefferson
was
wont
to
come
to
*NL*
this
same
place
,
or
that
Henry
E.
Dixie
,
a
well-known
performer
of
the
*NL*
day
,
was
then
only
a
few
tables
off
.
At
Rector
's
he
could
always
obtain
*NL*
this
satisfaction
,
for
there
one
could
encounter
politicians
,
brokers
,
*NL*
actors
,
some
rich
young
``
rounders
''
of
the
town
,
all
eating
and
drinking
*NL*
amid
a
buzz
of
popular
commonplace
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
So-and-so
over
there
,
''
was
a
common
remark
of
these
gentlemen
*NL*
among
themselves
,
particularly
among
those
who
had
not
yet
reached
,
but
*NL*
hoped
to
do
so
,
the
dazzling
height
which
money
to
dine
here
lavishly
*NL*
represented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
,
''
would
be
the
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
did
n't
you
know
that
?
Why
,
he
's
manager
of
the
Grand
Opera
*NL*
House
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
things
would
fall
upon
Drouet
's
ears
,
he
would
straighten
*NL*
himself
a
little
more
stiffly
and
eat
with
solid
comfort
.
If
he
had
any
*NL*
vanity
,
this
augmented
it
,
and
if
he
had
any
ambition
,
this
stirred
it
.
*NL*
He
would
be
able
to
flash
a
roll
of
greenbacks
too
some
day
.
As
it
was
,
*NL*
he
could
eat
where
THEY
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
preference
for
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
's
Adams
Street
place
was
another
*NL*
yard
off
the
same
cloth
.
This
was
really
a
gorgeous
saloon
from
a
*NL*
Chicago
standpoint
.
Like
Rector
's
,
it
was
also
ornamented
with
a
blaze
*NL*
of
incandescent
lights
,
held
in
handsome
chandeliers
.
The
floors
were
of
*NL*
brightly
coloured
tiles
,
the
walls
a
composition
of
rich
,
dark
,
polished
*NL*
wood
,
which
reflected
the
light
,
and
coloured
stucco-work
,
which
gave
*NL*
the
place
a
very
sumptuous
appearance
.
The
long
bar
was
a
blaze
of
*NL*
lights
,
polished
woodwork
,
coloured
and
cut
glassware
,
and
many
fancy
*NL*
bottles
.
It
was
a
truly
swell
saloon
,
with
rich
screens
,
fancy
wines
,
*NL*
and
a
line
of
bar
goods
unsurpassed
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Rector
's
,
Drouet
had
met
Mr.
G.
W.
Hurstwood
,
manager
of
Fitzgerald
*NL*
and
Moy
's
.
He
had
been
pointed
out
as
a
very
successful
and
well-known
*NL*
man
about
town
.
Hurstwood
looked
the
part
,
for
,
besides
being
slightly
*NL*
under
forty
,
he
had
a
good
,
stout
constitution
,
an
active
manner
,
and
a
*NL*
solid
,
substantial
air
,
which
was
composed
in
part
of
his
fine
clothes
,
*NL*
his
clean
linen
,
his
jewels
,
and
,
above
all
,
his
own
sense
of
his
*NL*
importance
.
Drouet
immediately
conceived
a
notion
of
him
as
being
some
*NL*
one
worth
knowing
,
and
was
glad
not
only
to
meet
him
,
but
to
visit
the
*NL*
Adams
Street
bar
thereafter
whenever
he
wanted
a
drink
or
a
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
an
interesting
character
after
his
kind
.
He
was
shrewd
and
*NL*
clever
in
many
little
things
,
and
capable
of
creating
a
good
impression
.
*NL*
His
managerial
position
was
fairly
important
--
a
kind
of
stewardship
*NL*
which
was
imposing
,
but
lacked
financial
control
.
He
had
risen
by
*NL*
perseverance
and
industry
,
through
long
years
of
service
,
from
the
*NL*
position
of
barkeeper
in
a
commonplace
saloon
to
his
present
altitude
.
*NL*
He
had
a
little
office
in
the
place
,
set
off
in
polished
cherry
and
*NL*
grill-work
,
where
he
kept
,
in
a
roll-top
desk
,
the
rather
simple
*NL*
accounts
of
the
place
--
supplies
ordered
and
needed
.
The
chief
executive
*NL*
and
financial
functions
devolved
upon
the
owners
--
Messrs.
Fitzgerald
and
*NL*
Moy
--
and
upon
a
cashier
who
looked
after
the
money
taken
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
most
part
he
lounged
about
,
dressed
in
excellent
tailored
suits
*NL*
of
imported
goods
,
a
solitaire
ring
,
a
fine
blue
diamond
in
his
tie
,
*NL*
a
striking
vest
of
some
new
pattern
,
and
a
watch-chain
of
solid
gold
,
*NL*
which
held
a
charm
of
rich
design
,
and
a
watch
of
the
latest
make
and
*NL*
engraving
.
He
knew
by
name
,
and
could
greet
personally
with
a
``
Well
,
old
*NL*
fellow
,
''
hundreds
of
actors
,
merchants
,
politicians
,
and
the
general
run
*NL*
of
successful
characters
about
town
,
and
it
was
part
of
his
success
to
*NL*
do
so
.
He
had
a
finely
graduated
scale
of
informality
and
*NL*
friendship
,
which
improved
from
the
``
How
do
you
do
?
''
addressed
to
*NL*
the
fifteen-dollar-a-week
clerks
and
office
attaches
,
who
,
by
long
*NL*
frequenting
of
the
place
,
became
aware
of
his
position
,
to
the
``
Why
,
old
*NL*
man
,
how
are
you
?
''
which
he
addressed
to
those
noted
or
rich
individuals
*NL*
who
knew
him
and
were
inclined
to
be
friendly
.
There
was
a
class
,
*NL*
however
,
too
rich
,
too
famous
,
or
too
successful
,
with
whom
he
could
not
*NL*
attempt
any
familiarity
of
address
,
and
with
these
he
was
professionally
*NL*
tactful
,
assuming
a
grave
and
dignified
attitude
,
paying
them
the
*NL*
deference
which
would
win
their
good
feeling
without
in
the
least
*NL*
compromising
his
own
bearing
and
opinions
.
There
were
,
in
the
last
*NL*
place
,
a
few
good
followers
,
neither
rich
nor
poor
,
famous
,
nor
yet
*NL*
remarkably
successful
,
with
whom
he
was
friendly
on
the
score
of
*NL*
good-fellowship
.
These
were
the
kind
of
men
with
whom
he
would
converse
*NL*
longest
and
most
seriously
.
He
loved
to
go
out
and
have
a
good
time
*NL*
once
in
a
while
--
to
go
to
the
races
,
the
theatres
,
the
sporting
*NL*
entertainments
at
some
of
the
clubs
.
He
kept
a
horse
and
neat
trap
,
had
*NL*
his
wife
and
two
children
,
who
were
well
established
in
a
neat
house
on
*NL*
the
North
Side
near
Lincoln
Park
,
and
was
altogether
a
very
acceptable
*NL*
individual
of
our
great
American
upper
class
--
the
first
grade
below
the
*NL*
luxuriously
rich
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
liked
Drouet
.
The
latter
's
genial
nature
and
dressy
appearance
*NL*
pleased
him
.
He
knew
that
Drouet
was
only
a
travelling
salesman
--
and
not
*NL*
one
of
many
years
at
that
--
but
the
firm
of
Bartlett
,
Caryoe
&
Company
*NL*
was
a
large
and
prosperous
house
,
and
Drouet
stood
well
.
Hurstwood
*NL*
knew
Caryoe
quite
well
,
having
drunk
a
glass
now
and
then
with
him
,
in
*NL*
company
with
several
others
,
when
the
conversation
was
general
.
Drouet
*NL*
had
what
was
a
help
in
his
business
,
a
moderate
sense
of
humour
,
and
*NL*
could
tell
a
good
story
when
the
occasion
required
.
He
could
talk
races
*NL*
with
Hurstwood
,
tell
interesting
incidents
concerning
himself
and
his
*NL*
experiences
with
women
,
and
report
the
state
of
trade
in
the
cities
*NL*
which
he
visited
,
and
so
managed
to
make
himself
almost
invariably
*NL*
agreeable
.
To-night
he
was
particularly
so
,
since
his
report
to
the
*NL*
company
had
been
favourably
commented
upon
,
his
new
samples
had
been
*NL*
satisfactorily
selected
,
and
his
trip
marked
out
for
the
next
six
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
hello
,
Charlie
,
old
man
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
as
Drouet
came
in
that
*NL*
evening
about
eight
o'clock
.
``
How
goes
it
?
''
The
room
was
crowded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
shook
hands
,
beaming
good
nature
,
and
they
strolled
towards
the
*NL*
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
seen
you
in
six
weeks
.
When
did
you
get
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friday
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
Had
a
fine
trip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
of
it
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
his
black
eyes
lit
with
a
warmth
which
*NL*
half
displaced
the
cold
make-believe
that
usually
dwelt
in
them
.
``
What
*NL*
are
you
going
to
take
?
''
he
added
,
as
the
barkeeper
,
in
snowy
jacket
and
*NL*
tie
,
leaned
toward
them
from
behind
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
Pepper
,
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
of
the
same
for
me
,
''
put
in
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
are
you
in
town
this
time
?
''
inquired
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
until
Wednesday
.
I
'm
going
up
to
St.
Paul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
Evans
was
in
here
Saturday
and
said
he
saw
you
in
Milwaukee
last
*NL*
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
saw
George
,
''
returned
Drouet
.
``
Great
old
boy
,
is
n't
he
?
We
had
*NL*
quite
a
time
there
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
barkeeper
was
setting
out
the
glasses
and
bottle
before
them
,
and
*NL*
they
now
poured
out
the
draught
as
they
talked
,
Drouet
filling
his
to
*NL*
within
a
third
of
full
,
as
was
considered
proper
,
and
Hurstwood
taking
*NL*
the
barest
suggestion
of
whiskey
and
modifying
it
with
seltzer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
become
of
Caryoe
?
''
remarked
Hurstwood
.
``
I
have
n't
seen
him
*NL*
around
here
in
two
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laid
up
,
they
say
,
''
exclaimed
Drouet
.
``
Say
,
he
's
a
gouty
old
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Made
a
lot
of
money
in
his
time
,
though
,
has
n't
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
wads
of
it
,
''
returned
Drouet
.
``
He
wo
n't
live
much
longer
.
Barely
*NL*
comes
down
to
the
office
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
one
boy
,
has
n't
he
?
''
asked
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
a
swift-pacer
,
''
laughed
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
he
ca
n't
hurt
the
business
very
much
,
though
,
with
the
other
*NL*
members
all
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
ca
n't
injure
that
any
,
I
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
standing
,
his
coat
open
,
his
thumbs
in
his
pockets
,
*NL*
the
light
on
his
jewels
and
rings
relieving
them
with
agreeable
*NL*
distinctness
.
He
was
the
picture
of
fastidious
comfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
one
not
inclined
to
drink
,
and
gifted
with
a
more
serious
turn
of
*NL*
mind
,
such
a
bubbling
,
chattering
,
glittering
chamber
must
ever
seem
an
*NL*
anomaly
,
a
strange
commentary
on
nature
and
life
.
Here
come
the
*NL*
moths
,
in
endless
procession
,
to
bask
in
the
light
of
the
flame
.
Such
*NL*
conversation
as
one
may
hear
would
not
warrant
a
commendation
of
the
*NL*
scene
upon
intellectual
grounds
.
It
seems
plain
that
schemers
*NL*
would
choose
more
sequestered
quarters
to
arrange
their
plans
,
that
*NL*
politicians
would
not
gather
here
in
company
to
discuss
anything
save
*NL*
formalities
,
where
the
sharp-eared
may
hear
,
and
it
would
scarcely
be
*NL*
justified
on
the
score
of
thirst
,
for
the
majority
of
those
who
frequent
*NL*
these
more
gorgeous
places
have
no
craving
for
liquor
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
the
fact
that
here
men
gather
,
here
chatter
,
here
love
to
pass
and
rub
*NL*
elbows
,
must
be
explained
upon
some
grounds
.
It
must
be
that
a
strange
*NL*
bundle
of
passions
and
vague
desires
give
rise
to
such
a
curious
social
*NL*
institution
or
it
would
not
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
,
for
one
,
was
lured
as
much
by
his
longing
for
pleasure
as
by
his
*NL*
desire
to
shine
among
his
betters
.
The
many
friends
he
met
here
dropped
*NL*
in
because
they
craved
,
without
,
perhaps
,
consciously
analysing
it
,
the
*NL*
company
,
the
glow
,
the
atmosphere
which
they
found
.
One
might
take
it
,
*NL*
after
all
,
as
an
augur
of
the
better
social
order
,
for
the
things
which
*NL*
they
satisfied
here
,
though
sensory
,
were
not
evil
.
No
evil
could
come
*NL*
out
of
the
contemplation
of
an
expensively
decorated
chamber
.
The
*NL*
worst
effect
of
such
a
thing
would
be
,
perhaps
,
to
stir
up
in
the
*NL*
material-minded
an
ambition
to
arrange
their
lives
upon
a
similarly
*NL*
splendid
basis
.
In
the
last
analysis
,
that
would
scarcely
be
called
the
*NL*
fault
of
the
decorations
,
but
rather
of
the
innate
trend
of
the
mind
.
*NL*
That
such
a
scene
might
stir
the
less
expensively
dressed
to
emulate
the
*NL*
more
expensively
dressed
could
scarcely
be
laid
at
the
door
of
anything
*NL*
save
the
false
ambition
of
the
minds
of
those
so
affected
.
Remove
the
*NL*
element
so
thoroughly
and
solely
complained
of
--
liquor
--
and
there
would
*NL*
not
be
one
to
gainsay
the
qualities
of
beauty
and
enthusiasm
which
would
*NL*
remain
.
The
pleased
eye
with
which
our
modern
restaurants
of
fashion
are
*NL*
looked
upon
is
proof
of
this
assertion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
here
is
the
fact
of
the
lighted
chamber
,
the
dressy
,
greedy
*NL*
company
,
the
small
,
self-interested
palaver
,
the
disorganized
,
aimless
,
*NL*
wandering
mental
action
which
it
represents
--
the
love
of
light
and
show
*NL*
and
finery
which
,
to
one
outside
,
under
the
serene
light
of
the
eternal
*NL*
stars
,
must
seem
a
strange
and
shiny
thing
.
Under
the
stars
and
sweeping
*NL*
night
winds
,
what
a
lamp-flower
it
must
bloom
;
a
strange
,
glittering
*NL*
night-flower
,
odour-yielding
,
insect-drawing
,
insect-infested
rose
of
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
that
fellow
coming
in
there
?
''
said
Hurstwood
,
glancing
at
a

just
entering

arrayed
in
a
high
hat
and
Prince
Albert
coat
,
*NL*
his
fat
cheeks
puffed
and
red
as
with
good
eating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

where
?
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There

''
said
Hurstwood
,
indicating
the
direction
by
a
cast
of
his
eye
,
*NL*
``

with

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Drouet
,
now
affecting
not
to
see
.
``
Who
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
Jules
Wallace
,
the
spiritualist

''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
followed
him
with
his
eyes
,
much
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
look
much
like
a
man
who
sees
spirits
,
does
he
?
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
returned
Hurstwood
.
``
He
's
got
the
money
,
all
right
,
''
*NL*
and
a
little
twinkle
passed
over
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
go
much
on
those
things
,
do
you
?
''
asked
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
never
can
tell
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
There
may
be
something
to
*NL*
it
.
I
would
n't
bother
about
it
myself
,
though
.
By
the
way

''
he
added
,
*NL*
``
are
you
going
anywhere
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
Hole
in
the
Ground

''
said
Drouet
,
mentioning
the
popular
farce
of
*NL*
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'd
better
be
going
.
It
's
half
after
eight
already
,
''
and
he
*NL*
drew
out
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
was
already
thinning
out
considerably
--
some
bound
for
the
*NL*
theatres
,
some
to
their
clubs
,
and
some
to
that
most
fascinating
of
*NL*
all
the
pleasures
--
for
the
type
of
man
there
represented
,
at
least
--
the
*NL*
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
,
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
around
after
the
show
.
I
have
something
I
want
to
show
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
said
Drouet
,
elated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
anything
on

you

''
added
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
come
round
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
struck
a
little
peach
coming
in
on
the
train
Friday

''
remarked
*NL*
Drouet
,
by
way
of
parting
.
``
By
George
,
that
's
so
,
I
must
go
and
call
on
*NL*
her
before
I
go
away

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
never
mind
her
,
''
Hurstwood
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
she
was
a
little
dandy
,
I
tell
you
,
''
went
on
Drouet
*NL*
confidentially
,
and
trying
to
impress
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twelve
o'clock
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
said
Drouet
,
going
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
was
Carrie
's
name
bandied
about
in
the
most
frivolous
and
gay
of
*NL*
places
,
and
that
also
when
the
little
toiler
was
bemoaning
her
narrow
*NL*
lot
,
which
was
almost
inseparable
from
the
early
stages
of
this
,
her
*NL*
unfolding
fate

Chapter
VI
.
THE
MACHINE
AND
THE
MAIDEN
--
A
KNIGHT
OF
TO-DAY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
flat
that
evening
Carrie
felt
a
new
phase
of
its
atmosphere
.
The
*NL*
fact
that
it
was
unchanged
,
while
her
feelings
were
different
,
increased
*NL*
her
knowledge
of
its
character
.
Minnie
,
after
the
good
spirits
Carrie
*NL*
manifested
at
first
,
expected
a
fair
report
.
Hanson
supposed
that
Carrie
*NL*
would
be
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
came
in
from
the
hall
in
his
working
clothes
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
Carrie
through
the
dining-room
door
,
``
how
did
you
make
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
it
's
pretty
hard
.
I
do
n't
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
air
about
her
which
showed
plainer
than
any
words
that
she
*NL*
was
both
weary
and
disappointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
work
is
it
?
''
he
asked
,
lingering
a
moment
as
he
turned
*NL*
upon
his
heel
to
go
into
the
bathroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Running
a
machine
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
evident
that
it
did
not
concern
him
much
,
save
from
the
side
*NL*
of
the
flat
's
success
.
He
was
irritated
a
shade
because
it
could
not
*NL*
have
come
about
in
the
throw
of
fortune
for
Carrie
to
be
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
worked
with
less
elation
than
she
had
just
before
Carrie
arrived
.
*NL*
The
sizzle
of
the
meat
frying
did
not
sound
quite
so
pleasing
now
that
*NL*
Carrie
had
reported
her
discontent
.
To
Carrie
,
the
one
relief
of
the
*NL*
whole
day
would
have
been
a
jolly
home
,
a
sympathetic
reception
,
a
*NL*
bright
supper
table
,
and
some
one
to
say
:
``
Oh
,
well
,
stand
it
a
little
*NL*
while
.
You
will
get
something
better
,
''
but
now
this
was
ashes
.
She
began
*NL*
to
see
that
they
looked
upon
her
complaint
as
unwarranted
,
and
that
she
*NL*
was
supposed
to
work
on
and
say
nothing
.
She
knew
that
she
was
to
pay
*NL*
four
dollars
for
her
board
and
room
,
and
now
she
felt
that
it
would
be
*NL*
an
exceedingly
gloomy
round
,
living
with
these
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
was
no
companion
for
her
sister
--
she
was
too
old
.
Her
thoughts
*NL*
were
staid
and
solemnly
adapted
to
a
condition
.
If
Hanson
had
any
*NL*
pleasant
thoughts
or
happy
feelings
he
concealed
them
.
He
seemed
to
do
*NL*
all
his
mental
operations
without
the
aid
of
physical
expression
.
He
was
*NL*
as
still
as
a
deserted
chamber
.
Carrie
,
on
the
other
hand
,
had
the
blood
*NL*
of
youth
and
some
imagination
.
Her
day
of
love
and
the
mysteries
of
*NL*
courtship
were
still
ahead
.
She
could
think
of
things
she
would
like
to
*NL*
do
,
of
clothes
she
would
like
to
wear
,
and
of
places
she
would
like
to
*NL*
visit
.
These
were
the
things
upon
which
her
mind
ran
,
and
it
was
like
*NL*
meeting
with
opposition
at
every
turn
to
find
no
one
here
to
call
forth
*NL*
or
respond
to
her
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
forgotten
,
in
considering
and
explaining
the
result
of
her
day
,
*NL*
that
Drouet
might
come
.
Now
,
when
she
saw
how
unreceptive
these
two
*NL*
people
were
,
she
hoped
he
would
not
.
She
did
not
know
exactly
what
she
*NL*
would
do
or
how
she
would
explain
to
Drouet
,
if
he
came
.
After
supper
*NL*
she
changed
her
clothes
.
When
she
was
trimly
dressed
she
was
rather
a
*NL*
sweet
little
being
,
with
large
eyes
and
a
sad
mouth
.
Her
face
expressed
*NL*
the
mingled
expectancy
,
dissatisfaction
,
and
depression
she
felt
.
She
*NL*
wandered
about
after
the
dishes
were
put
away
,
talked
a
little
with
*NL*
Minnie
,
and
then
decided
to
go
down
and
stand
in
the
door
at
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
stairs
.
If
Drouet
came
,
she
could
meet
him
there
.
Her
face
took
on
*NL*
the
semblance
of
a
look
of
happiness
as
she
put
on
her
hat
to
go
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
does
n't
seem
to
like
her
place
very
well
,
''
said
Minnie
to
*NL*
her
husband
when
the
latter
came
out
,
paper
in
hand
,
to
sit
in
the
*NL*
dining-room
a
few
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ought
to
keep
it
for
a
time
,
anyhow
,
''
said
Hanson
.
``
Has
she
gone
*NL*
downstairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
tell
her
to
keep
it
if
I
were
you
.
She
might
be
here
weeks
without
*NL*
getting
another
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
said
she
would
,
and
Hanson
read
his
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
you
,
''
he
said
a
little
later
,
``
I
would
n't
let
her
stand
in
*NL*
the
door
down
there
.
It
do
n't
look
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
her
,
''
said
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
life
of
the
streets
continued
for
a
long
time
to
interest
Carrie
.
*NL*
She
never
wearied
of
wondering
where
the
people
in
the
cars
were
going
*NL*
or
what
their
enjoyments
were
.
Her
imagination
trod
a
very
narrow
round
,
*NL*
always
winding
up
at
points
which
concerned
money
,
looks
,
clothes
,
or
*NL*
enjoyment
.
She
would
have
a
far-off
thought
of
Columbia
City
now
and
*NL*
then
,
or
an
irritating
rush
of
feeling
concerning
her
experiences
of
the
*NL*
present
day
,
but
,
on
the
whole
,
the
little
world
about
her
enlisted
her
*NL*
whole
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
floor
of
the
building
,
of
which
Hanson
's
flat
was
the
third
,
*NL*
was
occupied
by
a
bakery
,
and
to
this
,
while
she
was
standing
there
,
*NL*
Hanson
came
down
to
buy
a
loaf
of
bread
.
She
was
not
aware
of
his
*NL*
presence
until
he
was
quite
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
after
bread
,
''
was
all
he
said
as
he
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
contagion
of
thought
here
demonstrated
itself
.
While
Hanson
really
*NL*
came
for
bread
,
the
thought
dwelt
with
him
that
now
he
would
see
what
*NL*
Carrie
was
doing
.
No
sooner
did
he
draw
near
her
with
that
in
mind
than
*NL*
she
felt
it
.
Of
course
,
she
had
no
understanding
of
what
put
it
into
*NL*
her
head
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
aroused
in
her
the
first
shade
of
*NL*
real
antipathy
to
him
.
She
knew
now
that
she
did
not
like
him
.
He
was
*NL*
suspicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
thought
will
colour
a
world
for
us
.
The
flow
of
Carrie
's
meditations
*NL*
had
been
disturbed
,
and
Hanson
had
not
long
gone
upstairs
before
she
*NL*
followed
.
She
had
realised
with
the
lapse
of
the
quarter
hours
that
*NL*
Drouet
was
not
coming
,
and
somehow
she
felt
a
little
resentful
,
a
little
*NL*
as
if
she
had
been
forsaken
--
was
not
good
enough
.
She
went
upstairs
,
*NL*
where
everything
was
silent
.
Minnie
was
sewing
by
a
lamp
at
the
table
.
*NL*
Hanson
had
already
turned
in
for
the
night
.
In
her
weariness
and
*NL*
disappointment
Carrie
did
no
more
than
announce
that
she
was
going
to
*NL*
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
'd
better
,
''
returned
Minnie
.
``
You
've
got
to
get
up
early
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
was
no
better
.
Hanson
was
just
going
out
the
door
as
Carrie
*NL*
came
from
her
room
.
Minnie
tried
to
talk
with
her
during
breakfast
,
but
*NL*
there
was
not
much
of
interest
which
they
could
mutually
discuss
.
As
on
*NL*
the
previous
morning
,
Carrie
walked
down
town
,
for
she
began
to
realise
*NL*
now
that
her
four-fifty
would
not
even
allow
her
car
fare
after
she
paid
*NL*
her
board
.
This
seemed
a
miserable
arrangement
.
But
the
morning
light
*NL*
swept
away
the
first
misgivings
of
the
day
,
as
morning
light
is
ever
*NL*
wont
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
shoe
factory
she
put
in
a
long
day
,
scarcely
so
wearisome
as
the
*NL*
preceding
,
but
considerably
less
novel
.
The
head
foreman
,
on
his
round
,
*NL*
stopped
by
her
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
come
from
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Brown
hired
me
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
did
,
eh
!
''
and
then
,
``
See
that
you
keep
things
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
machine
girls
impressed
her
even
less
favourably
.
They
seemed
*NL*
satisfied
with
their
lot
,
and
were
in
a
sense
``
common
.
''
Carrie
had
more
*NL*
imagination
than
they
.
She
was
not
used
to
slang
.
Her
instinct
in
the
*NL*
matter
of
dress
was
naturally
better
.
She
disliked
to
listen
to
the
girl
*NL*
next
to
her
,
who
was
rather
hardened
by
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
quit
this
,
''
she
heard
her
remark
to
her
neighbour
.
``
What
*NL*
with
the
stipend
and
being
up
late
,
it
's
too
much
for
me
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
free
with
the
fellows
,
young
and
old
,
about
the
place
,
and
*NL*
exchanged
banter
in
rude
phrases
,
which
at
first
shocked
her
.
She
saw
*NL*
that
she
was
taken
to
be
of
the
same
sort
and
addressed
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
''
remarked
one
of
the
stout-wristed
sole-workers
to
her
at
noon
.
*NL*
``
You
're
a
daisy
.
''
He
really
expected
to
hear
the
common
``
Aw
!
go
chase
*NL*
yourself
!
''
in
return
,
and
was
sufficiently
abashed
,
by
Carrie
's
silently
*NL*
moving
away
,
to
retreat
,
awkwardly
grinning
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
at
the
flat
she
was
even
more
lonely
--
the
dull
situation
*NL*
was
becoming
harder
to
endure
.
She
could
see
that
the
Hansons
seldom
*NL*
or
never
had
any
company
.
Standing
at
the
street
door
looking
out
,
*NL*
she
ventured
to
walk
out
a
little
way
.
Her
easy
gait
and
idle
manner
*NL*
attracted
attention
of
an
offensive
but
common
sort
.
She
was
slightly
*NL*
taken
back
at
the
overtures
of
a
well-dressed
man
of
thirty
,
who
in
*NL*
passing
looked
at
her
,
reduced
his
pace
,
turned
back
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
for
a
little
stroll
,
are
you
,
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
in
amazement
,
and
then
summoned
sufficient
thought
*NL*
to
reply
:
``
Why
,
I
do
n't
know
you
,
''
backing
away
as
she
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
do
n't
matter
,
''
said
the
other
affably
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bandied
no
more
words
with
him
,
but
hurried
away
,
reaching
her
own
*NL*
door
quite
out
of
breath
.
There
was
something
in
the
man
's
look
which
*NL*
frightened
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
remainder
of
the
week
it
was
very
much
the
same
.
One
or
two
*NL*
nights
she
found
herself
too
tired
to
walk
home
,
and
expended
car
fare
.
*NL*
She
was
not
very
strong
,
and
sitting
all
day
affected
her
back
.
She
went
*NL*
to
bed
one
night
before
Hanson
.
*NL*
*NL*
Transplantation
is
not
always
successful
in
the
matter
of
flowers
or
*NL*
maidens
.
It
requires
sometimes
a
richer
soil
,
a
better
atmosphere
*NL*
to
continue
even
a
natural
growth
.
It
would
have
been
better
if
her
*NL*
acclimatization
had
been
more
gradual
--
less
rigid
.
She
would
have
done
*NL*
better
if
she
had
not
secured
a
position
so
quickly
,
and
had
seen
more
*NL*
of
the
city
which
she
constantly
troubled
to
know
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
first
morning
it
rained
she
found
that
she
had
no
umbrella
.
*NL*
Minnie
loaned
her
one
of
hers
,
which
was
worn
and
faded
.
There
was
the
*NL*
kind
of
vanity
in
Carrie
that
troubled
at
this
.
She
went
to
one
of
the
*NL*
great
department
stores
and
bought
herself
one
,
using
a
dollar
and
a
*NL*
quarter
of
her
small
store
to
pay
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
do
that
for
,
Carrie
?
''
asked
Minnie
when
she
saw
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
need
one
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
foolish
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
resented
this
,
though
she
did
not
reply
.
She
was
not
going
to
be
*NL*
a
common
shop-girl
,
she
thought
;
they
need
not
think
it
,
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
first
Saturday
night
Carrie
paid
her
board
,
four
dollars
.
Minnie
*NL*
had
a
quaver
of
conscience
as
she
took
it
,
but
did
not
know
how
to
*NL*
explain
to
Hanson
if
she
took
less
.
That
worthy
gave
up
just
four
*NL*
dollars
less
toward
the
household
expenses
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
He
contemplated
increasing
his
Building
and
Loan
payments
.
As
for
*NL*
Carrie
,
she
studied
over
the
problem
of
finding
clothes
and
amusement
*NL*
on
fifty
cents
a
week
.
She
brooded
over
this
until
she
was
in
a
state
of
*NL*
mental
rebellion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
up
the
street
for
a
walk
,
''
she
said
after
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
alone
,
are
you
?
''
asked
Hanson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
returned
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
,
''
said
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
SOMETHING
,
''
said
Carrie
,
and
by
the
tone
she
put
into
*NL*
the
last
word
they
realised
for
the
first
time
she
was
not
pleased
with
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
her
?
''
asked
Hanson
,
when
she
went
into
the
front
*NL*
room
to
get
her
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
ought
to
know
better
than
to
want
to
go
out
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
did
not
go
very
far
,
after
all
.
She
returned
and
stood
in
the
*NL*
door
.
The
next
day
they
went
out
to
Garfield
Park
,
but
it
did
not
please
*NL*
her
.
She
did
not
look
well
enough
.
In
the
shop
next
day
she
heard
the
*NL*
highly
coloured
reports
which
girls
give
of
their
trivial
amusements
.
*NL*
They
had
been
happy
.
On
several
days
it
rained
and
she
used
up
car
fare
.
*NL*
One
night
she
got
thoroughly
soaked
,
going
to
catch
the
car
at
Van
Buren
*NL*
Street
.
All
that
evening
she
sat
alone
in
the
front
room
looking
out
*NL*
upon
the
street
,
where
the
lights
were
reflected
on
the
wet
pavements
,
*NL*
thinking
.
She
had
imagination
enough
to
be
moody
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Saturday
she
paid
another
four
dollars
and
pocketed
her
fifty
cents
*NL*
in
despair
.
The
speaking
acquaintanceship
which
she
formed
with
some
of
*NL*
the
girls
at
the
shop
discovered
to
her
the
fact
that
they
had
more
of
*NL*
their
earnings
to
use
for
themselves
than
she
did
.
They
had
young
men
*NL*
of
the
kind
whom
she
,
since
her
experience
with
Drouet
,
felt
above
,
who
*NL*
took
them
about
.
She
came
to
thoroughly
dislike
the
light-headed
young
*NL*
fellows
of
the
shop
.
Not
one
of
them
had
a
show
of
refinement
.
She
saw
*NL*
only
their
workday
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
day
when
the
first
premonitory
blast
of
winter
swept
over
*NL*
the
city
.
It
scudded
the
fleecy
clouds
in
the
heavens
,
trailed
long
,
*NL*
thin
streamers
of
smoke
from
the
tall
stacks
,
and
raced
about
the
*NL*
streets
and
corners
in
sharp
and
sudden
puffs
.
Carrie
now
felt
the
*NL*
problem
of
winter
clothes
.
What
was
she
to
do
?
She
had
no
winter
jacket
,
*NL*
no
hat
,
no
shoes
.
It
was
difficult
to
speak
to
Minnie
about
this
,
but
at
*NL*
last
she
summoned
the
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'm
going
to
do
about
clothes
,
''
she
said
one
evening
*NL*
when
they
were
together
.
``
I
need
a
hat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
looked
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
keep
part
of
your
money
and
buy
yourself
one
?
''
she
*NL*
suggested
,
worried
over
the
situation
which
the
withholding
of
Carrie
's
*NL*
money
would
create
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
for
a
week
or
so
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
,
''
ventured
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
pay
two
dollars
?
''
asked
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
readily
acquiesced
,
glad
to
escape
the
trying
situation
,
and
*NL*
liberal
now
that
she
saw
a
way
out
.
She
was
elated
and
began
figuring
at
*NL*
once
.
She
needed
a
hat
first
of
all
.
How
Minnie
explained
to
Hanson
she
*NL*
never
knew
.
He
said
nothing
at
all
,
but
there
were
thoughts
in
the
air
*NL*
which
left
disagreeable
impressions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
arrangement
might
have
worked
if
sickness
had
not
intervened
.
It
*NL*
blew
up
cold
after
a
rain
one
afternoon
when
Carrie
was
still
without
*NL*
a
jacket
.
She
came
out
of
the
warm
shop
at
six
and
shivered
as
the
wind
*NL*
struck
her
.
In
the
morning
she
was
sneezing
,
and
going
down
town
made
*NL*
it
worse
.
That
day
her
bones
ached
and
she
felt
light-headed
.
Towards
*NL*
evening
she
felt
very
ill
,
and
when
she
reached
home
was
not
hungry
.
*NL*
Minnie
noticed
her
drooping
actions
and
asked
her
about
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
feel
real
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hung
about
the
stove
,
suffered
a
chattering
chill
,
and
went
to
bed
*NL*
sick
.
The
next
morning
she
was
thoroughly
feverish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
was
truly
distressed
at
this
,
but
maintained
a
kindly
demeanour
.
*NL*
Hanson
said
perhaps
she
had
better
go
back
home
for
a
while
.
When
she
*NL*
got
up
after
three
days
,
it
was
taken
for
granted
that
her
position
was
*NL*
lost
.
The
winter
was
near
at
hand
,
she
had
no
clothes
,
and
now
she
was
*NL*
out
of
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
;
``
I
'll
go
down
Monday
and
see
if
I
ca
n't
get
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
anything
,
her
efforts
were
more
poorly
rewarded
on
this
trial
than
*NL*
the
last
.
Her
clothes
were
nothing
suitable
for
fall
wearing
.
Her
*NL*
last
money
she
had
spent
for
a
hat
.
For
three
days
she
wandered
*NL*
about
,
utterly
dispirited
.
The
attitude
of
the
flat
was
fast
becoming
*NL*
unbearable
.
She
hated
to
think
of
going
back
there
each
evening
.
Hanson
*NL*
was
so
cold
.
She
knew
it
could
not
last
much
longer
.
Shortly
she
would
*NL*
have
to
give
up
and
go
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
fourth
day
she
was
down
town
all
day
,
having
borrowed
ten
cents
*NL*
for
lunch
from
Minnie
.
She
had
applied
in
the
cheapest
kind
of
places
*NL*
without
success
.
She
even
answered
for
a
waitress
in
a
small
restaurant
*NL*
where
she
saw
a
card
in
the
window
,
but
they
wanted
an
experienced
girl
.
*NL*
She
moved
through
the
thick
throng
of
strangers
,
utterly
subdued
in
*NL*
spirit
.
Suddenly
a
hand
pulled
her
arm
and
turned
her
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
said
a
voice
.
In
the
first
glance
she
beheld
Drouet
.
He
*NL*
was
not
only
rosy-cheeked
,
but
radiant
.
He
was
the
essence
of
sunshine
*NL*
and
good-humour
.
``
Why
,
how
are
you
,
Carrie
?
''
he
said
.
``
You
're
a
daisy
.
*NL*
Where
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
smiled
under
his
irresistible
flood
of
geniality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
out
home
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
saw
you
across
the
street
there
.
I
thought
it
was
*NL*
you
.
I
was
just
coming
out
to
your
place
.
How
are
you
,
anyhow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
all
right
,
''
said
Carrie
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
looked
her
over
and
saw
something
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
want
to
talk
to
you
.
You
're
not
going
anywhere
in
*NL*
particular
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
just
now
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
up
here
and
have
something
to
eat
.
George
!
but
I
'm
glad
to
see
*NL*
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
so
relieved
in
his
radiant
presence
,
so
much
looked
after
and
*NL*
cared
for
,
that
she
assented
gladly
,
though
with
the
slightest
air
of
*NL*
holding
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
took
her
arm
--
and
there
was
an
exuberance
of
*NL*
good-fellowship
in
the
word
which
fairly
warmed
the
cockles
of
her
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
through
Monroe
Street
to
the
old
Windsor
dining-room
,
which
*NL*
was
then
a
large
,
comfortable
place
,
with
an
excellent
cuisine
and
*NL*
substantial
service
.
Drouet
selected
a
table
close
by
the
window
,
*NL*
where
the
busy
rout
of
the
street
could
be
seen
.
He
loved
the
changing
*NL*
panorama
of
the
street
--
to
see
and
be
seen
as
he
dined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
he
said
,
getting
Carrie
and
himself
comfortably
settled
,
``
what
*NL*
will
you
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
over
the
large
bill
of
fare
which
the
waiter
handed
her
*NL*
without
really
considering
it
.
She
was
very
hungry
,
and
the
things
she
*NL*
saw
there
awakened
her
desires
,
but
the
high
prices
held
her
attention
.
*NL*
``
Half
broiled
spring
chicken
--
seventy-five
.
Sirloin
steak
with
*NL*
mushrooms
--
one
twenty-five
.
''
She
had
dimly
heard
of
these
things
,
but
it
*NL*
seemed
strange
to
be
called
to
order
from
the
list
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
fix
this
,
''
exclaimed
Drouet
.
``
Sst
!
waiter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
officer
of
the
board
,
a
full-chested
,
round-faced
negro
,
*NL*
approached
,
and
inclined
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sirloin
with
mushrooms
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
Stuffed
tomatoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yassah
,
''
assented
the
negro
,
nodding
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hashed
brown
potatoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yassah
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Asparagus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yassah
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
pot
of
coffee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
turned
to
Carrie
.
``
I
have
n't
had
a
thing
since
breakfast
.
Just
*NL*
got
in
from
Rock
Island
.
I
was
going
off
to
dine
when
I
saw
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
smiled
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
been
doing
?
''
he
went
on
.
``
Tell
me
all
about
yourself
.
How
*NL*
is
your
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
well
,
''
returned
Carrie
,
answering
the
last
query
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
have
n't
been
sick
,
have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
that
's
a
blooming
shame
,
is
n't
it
?
You
do
n't
look
very
well
.
*NL*
I
thought
you
looked
a
little
pale
.
What
have
you
been
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Working
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
!
At
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rhodes
,
Morgenthau
and
Scott
--
why
,
I
know
that
house
over
here
on
*NL*
Fifth
Avenue
,
is
n't
it
?
They
're
a
close-fisted
concern
.
What
made
you
go
*NL*
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
get
anything
else
,
''
said
Carrie
frankly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
an
outrage
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
You
ought
n't
to
be
working
for
*NL*
those
people
.
Have
the
factory
right
back
of
the
store
,
do
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
n't
a
good
house
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
You
do
n't
want
to
work
at
*NL*
anything
like
that
,
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
chatted
on
at
a
great
rate
,
asking
questions
,
explaining
things
about
*NL*
himself
,
telling
her
what
a
good
restaurant
it
was
,
until
the
waiter
*NL*
returned
with
an
immense
tray
,
bearing
the
hot
savoury
dishes
which
had
*NL*
been
ordered
.
Drouet
fairly
shone
in
the
matter
of
serving
.
He
appeared
*NL*
to
great
advantage
behind
the
white
napery
and
silver
platters
of
the
*NL*
table
and
displaying
his
arms
with
a
knife
and
fork
.
As
he
cut
the
meat
*NL*
his
rings
almost
spoke
.
His
new
suit
creaked
as
he
stretched
to
reach
*NL*
the
plates
,
break
the
bread
,
and
pour
the
coffee
.
He
helped
Carrie
to
*NL*
a
rousing
plateful
and
contributed
the
warmth
of
his
spirit
to
her
body
*NL*
until
she
was
a
new
girl
.
He
was
a
splendid
fellow
in
the
true
popular
*NL*
understanding
of
the
term
,
and
captivated
Carrie
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
little
soldier
of
fortune
took
her
good
turn
in
an
easy
way
.
She
*NL*
felt
a
little
out
of
place
,
but
the
great
room
soothed
her
and
the
view
*NL*
of
the
well-dressed
throng
outside
seemed
a
splendid
thing
.
Ah
,
what
was
*NL*
it
not
to
have
money
!
What
a
thing
it
was
to
be
able
to
come
in
here
and
*NL*
dine
!
Drouet
must
be
fortunate
.
He
rode
on
trains
,
dressed
in
such
nice
*NL*
clothes
,
was
so
strong
,
and
ate
in
these
fine
places
.
He
seemed
quite
a
*NL*
figure
of
a
man
,
and
she
wondered
at
his
friendship
and
regard
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
lost
your
place
because
you
got
sick
,
eh
?
''
he
said
.
``
What
are
*NL*
you
going
to
do
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
around
,
''
she
said
,
a
thought
of
the
need
that
hung
outside
this
*NL*
fine
restaurant
like
a
hungry
dog
at
her
heels
passing
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Drouet
,
``
that
wo
n't
do
.
How
long
have
you
been
looking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
days
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
of
that
!
''
he
said
,
addressing
some
problematical
individual
.
``
You
*NL*
ought
n't
to
be
doing
anything
like
that
.
These
girls
,
''
and
he
waved
an
*NL*
inclusion
of
all
shop
and
factory
girls
,
``
do
n't
get
anything
.
Why
,
you
*NL*
ca
n't
live
on
it
,
can
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
brotherly
sort
of
creature
in
his
demeanour
.
When
he
had
*NL*
scouted
the
idea
of
that
kind
of
toil
,
he
took
another
tack
.
Carrie
was
*NL*
really
very
pretty
.
Even
then
,
in
her
commonplace
garb
,
her
figure
was
*NL*
evidently
not
bad
,
and
her
eyes
were
large
and
gentle
.
Drouet
looked
*NL*
at
her
and
his
thoughts
reached
home
.
She
felt
his
admiration
.
It
was
*NL*
powerfully
backed
by
his
liberality
and
good-humour
.
She
felt
that
she
*NL*
liked
him
--
that
she
could
continue
to
like
him
ever
so
much
.
There
was
*NL*
something
even
richer
than
that
,
running
as
a
hidden
strain
,
in
her
*NL*
mind
.
Every
little
while
her
eyes
would
meet
his
,
and
by
that
means
the
*NL*
interchanging
current
of
feeling
would
be
fully
connected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
stay
down
town
and
go
to
the
theatre
with
me
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
hitching
his
chair
closer
.
The
table
was
not
very
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
she
answered
,
a
little
drearily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
like
out
there
where
you
are
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
if
you
do
n't
get
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
back
home
,
I
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
least
quaver
in
her
voice
as
she
said
this
.
Somehow
,
the
*NL*
influence
he
was
exerting
was
powerful
.
They
came
to
an
understanding
of
*NL*
each
other
without
words
--
he
of
her
situation
,
she
of
the
fact
that
*NL*
he
realised
it
.
``
No
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
ca
n't
make
it
!
''
genuine
sympathy
*NL*
filling
his
mind
for
the
time
.
``
Let
me
help
you
.
You
take
some
of
my
*NL*
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
she
said
,
leaning
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
meditating
,
merely
shaking
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
quite
tenderly
for
his
kind
.
There
were
some
loose
*NL*
bills
in
his
vest
pocket
--
greenbacks
.
They
were
soft
and
noiseless
,
and
*NL*
he
got
his
fingers
about
them
and
crumpled
them
up
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'll
see
you
through
all
right
.
Get
yourself
some
*NL*
clothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
reference
he
had
made
to
that
subject
,
and
now
she
*NL*
realised
how
bad
off
she
was
.
In
his
crude
way
he
had
struck
the
*NL*
key-note
.
Her
lips
trembled
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
her
hand
out
on
the
table
before
her
.
They
were
quite
alone
in
*NL*
their
corner
,
and
he
put
his
larger
,
warmer
hand
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
,
come
,
Carrie
,
''
he
said
,
``
what
can
you
do
alone
?
Let
me
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
her
hand
gently
and
she
tried
to
withdraw
it
.
At
this
he
held
*NL*
it
fast
,
and
she
no
longer
protested
.
Then
he
slipped
the
greenbacks
he
*NL*
had
into
her
palm
,
and
when
she
began
to
protest
,
he
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
loan
it
to
you
--
that
's
all
right
.
I
'll
loan
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
her
take
it
.
She
felt
bound
to
him
by
a
strange
tie
of
affection
*NL*
now
.
They
went
out
,
and
he
walked
with
her
far
out
south
toward
Polk
*NL*
Street
,
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
want
to
live
with
those
people
?
''
he
said
in
one
place
,
*NL*
abstractedly
.
Carrie
heard
it
,
but
it
made
only
a
slight
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
down
and
meet
me
to
morrow
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
we
'll
go
to
the
*NL*
matinee
.
Will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
protested
a
while
,
but
acquiesced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
doing
anything
.
Get
yourself
a
nice
pair
of
shoes
and
a
*NL*
jacket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
scarcely
gave
a
thought
to
the
complication
which
would
trouble
*NL*
her
when
he
was
gone
.
In
his
presence
,
she
was
of
his
own
hopeful
,
*NL*
easy-way-out
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
bother
about
those
people
out
there
,
''
he
said
at
parting
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
left
him
,
feeling
as
though
a
great
arm
had
slipped
out
before
*NL*
her
to
draw
off
trouble
.
The
money
she
had
accepted
was
two
soft
,
green
,
*NL*
handsome
ten-dollar
bills
.

Chapter
VII
.
THE
LURE
OF
THE
MATERIAL
--
BEAUTY
SPEAKS
FOR
ITSELF
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
true
meaning
of
money
yet
remains
to
be
popularly
explained
and
*NL*
comprehended
.
When
each
individual
realises
for
himself
that
this
thing
*NL*
primarily
stands
for
and
should
only
be
accepted
as
a
moral
due
--
that
*NL*
it
should
be
paid
out
as
honestly
stored
energy
,
and
not
as
a
usurped
*NL*
privilege
--
many
of
our
social
,
religious
,
and
political
troubles
will
*NL*
have
permanently
passed
.
As
for
Carrie
,
her
understanding
of
the
moral
*NL*
significance
of
money
was
the
popular
understanding
,
nothing
more
.
The
*NL*
old
definition
:
``
Money
:
something
everybody
else
has
and
I
must
get
,
''
*NL*
would
have
expressed
her
understanding
of
it
thoroughly
.
Some
of
it
she
*NL*
now
held
in
her
hand
--
two
soft
,
green
ten-dollar
bills
--
and
she
felt
*NL*
that
she
was
immensely
better
off
for
the
having
of
them
.
It
was
*NL*
something
that
was
power
in
itself
.
One
of
her
order
of
mind
would
*NL*
have
been
content
to
be
cast
away
upon
a
desert
island
with
a
bundle
of
*NL*
money
,
and
only
the
long
strain
of
starvation
would
have
taught
her
that
*NL*
in
some
cases
it
could
have
no
value
.
Even
then
she
would
have
had
no
*NL*
conception
of
the
relative
value
of
the
thing
;
her
one
thought
would
,
*NL*
undoubtedly
,
have
concerned
the
pity
of
having
so
much
power
and
the
*NL*
inability
to
use
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
girl
thrilled
as
she
walked
away
from
Drouet
.
She
felt
ashamed
*NL*
in
part
because
she
had
been
weak
enough
to
take
it
,
but
her
need
was
so
*NL*
dire
,
she
was
still
glad
.
Now
she
would
have
a
nice
new
jacket
!
Now
she
*NL*
would
buy
a
nice
pair
of
pretty
button
shoes
.
She
would
get
stockings
,
*NL*
too
,
and
a
skirt
,
and
,
and
--
until
already
,
as
in
the
matter
of
her
*NL*
prospective
salary
,
she
had
got
beyond
,
in
her
desires
,
twice
the
*NL*
purchasing
power
of
her
bills
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
conceived
a
true
estimate
of
Drouet
.
To
her
,
and
indeed
to
all
the
*NL*
world
,
he
was
a
nice
,
good-hearted
man
.
There
was
nothing
evil
in
the
*NL*
fellow
.
He
gave
her
the
money
out
of
a
good
heart
--
out
of
a
realisation
*NL*
of
her
want
.
He
would
not
have
given
the
same
amount
to
a
poor
young
*NL*
man
,
but
we
must
not
forget
that
a
poor
young
man
could
not
,
in
*NL*
the
nature
of
things
,
have
appealed
to
him
like
a
poor
young
girl
.
*NL*
Femininity
affected
his
feelings
.
He
was
the
creature
of
an
inborn
*NL*
desire
.
Yet
no
beggar
could
have
caught
his
eye
and
said
,
``
My
God
,
*NL*
mister
,
I
'm
starving
,
''
but
he
would
gladly
have
handed
out
what
was
*NL*
considered
the
proper
portion
to
give
beggars
and
thought
no
more
about
*NL*
it
.
There
would
have
been
no
speculation
,
no
philosophising
.
He
had
no
*NL*
mental
process
in
him
worthy
the
dignity
of
either
of
those
terms
.
In
*NL*
his
good
clothes
and
fine
health
,
he
was
a
merry
,
unthinking
moth
of
the
*NL*
lamp
.
Deprived
of
his
position
,
and
struck
by
a
few
of
the
involved
and
*NL*
baffling
forces
which
sometimes
play
upon
man
,
he
would
have
been
as
*NL*
helpless
as
Carrie
--
as
helpless
,
as
non-understanding
,
as
pitiable
,
if
*NL*
you
will
,
as
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
in
regard
to
his
pursuit
of
women
,
he
meant
them
no
harm
,
because
*NL*
he
did
not
conceive
of
the
relation
which
he
hoped
to
hold
with
them
as
*NL*
being
harmful
.
He
loved
to
make
advances
to
women
,
to
have
them
succumb
*NL*
to
his
charms
,
not
because
he
was
a
cold-blooded
,
dark
,
scheming
*NL*
villain
,
but
because
his
inborn
desire
urged
him
to
that
as
a
chief
*NL*
delight
.
He
was
vain
,
he
was
boastful
,
he
was
as
deluded
by
fine
*NL*
clothes
as
any
silly-headed
girl
.
A
truly
deep-dyed
villain
could
*NL*
have
hornswaggled
him
as
readily
as
he
could
have
flattered
a
pretty
*NL*
shop-girl
.
His
fine
success
as
a
salesman
lay
in
his
geniality
and
the
*NL*
thoroughly
reputable
standing
of
his
house
.
He
bobbed
about
among
men
,
*NL*
a
veritable
bundle
of
enthusiasm
--
no
power
worthy
the
name
of
intellect
,
*NL*
no
thoughts
worthy
the
adjective
noble
,
no
feelings
long
continued
in
*NL*
one
strain
.
A
Madame
Sappho
would
have
called
him
a
pig
;
a
Shakespeare
*NL*
would
have
said
``
my
merry
child
''
;
old
,
drinking
Caryoe
thought
him
*NL*
a
clever
,
successful
businessman
.
In
short
,
he
was
as
good
as
his
*NL*
intellect
conceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
best
proof
that
there
was
something
open
and
commendable
about
the
*NL*
man
was
the
fact
that
Carrie
took
the
money
.
No
deep
,
sinister
soul
with
*NL*
ulterior
motives
could
have
given
her
fifteen
cents
under
the
guise
of
*NL*
friendship
.
The
unintellectual
are
not
so
helpless
.
Nature
has
taught
*NL*
the
beasts
of
the
field
to
fly
when
some
unheralded
danger
threatens
.
*NL*
She
has
put
into
the
small
,
unwise
head
of
the
chipmunk
the
untutored
*NL*
fear
of
poisons
.
``
He
keepeth
His
creatures
whole
,
''
was
not
written
of
*NL*
beasts
alone
.
Carrie
was
unwise
,
and
,
therefore
,
like
the
sheep
in
its
*NL*
unwisdom
,
strong
in
feeling
.
The
instinct
of
self-protection
,
strong
in
*NL*
all
such
natures
,
was
roused
but
feebly
,
if
at
all
,
by
the
overtures
of
*NL*
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carrie
had
gone
,
he
felicitated
himself
upon
her
good
opinion
.
By
*NL*
George
,
it
was
a
shame
young
girls
had
to
be
knocked
around
like
that
.
*NL*
Cold
weather
coming
on
and
no
clothes
.
Tough
.
He
would
go
around
to
*NL*
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
's
and
get
a
cigar
.
It
made
him
feel
light
of
foot
as
*NL*
he
thought
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
reached
home
in
high
good
spirits
,
which
she
could
scarcely
*NL*
conceal
.
The
possession
of
the
money
involved
a
number
of
points
which
*NL*
perplexed
her
seriously
.
How
should
she
buy
any
clothes
when
Minnie
*NL*
knew
that
she
had
no
money
?
She
had
no
sooner
entered
the
flat
than
this
*NL*
point
was
settled
for
her
.
It
could
not
be
done
.
She
could
think
of
no
*NL*
way
of
explaining
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
come
out
?
''
asked
Minnie
,
referring
to
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
none
of
the
small
deception
which
could
feel
one
thing
and
*NL*
say
something
directly
opposed
.
She
would
prevaricate
,
but
it
would
be
*NL*
in
the
line
of
her
feelings
at
least
.
So
instead
of
complaining
when
she
*NL*
felt
so
good
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
promise
of
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Boston
Store
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
sure
promised
?
''
questioned
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
to
find
out
to-morrow
,
''
returned
Carrie
disliking
to
draw
out
*NL*
a
lie
any
longer
than
was
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
felt
the
atmosphere
of
good
feeling
which
Carrie
brought
with
*NL*
her
.
She
felt
now
was
the
time
to
express
to
Carrie
the
state
of
*NL*
Hanson
's
feeling
about
her
entire
Chicago
venture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
should
n't
get
it
--
''
she
paused
,
troubled
for
an
easy
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
do
n't
get
something
pretty
soon
,
I
think
I
'll
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
saw
her
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sven
thinks
it
might
be
best
for
the
winter
,
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
flashed
on
Carrie
at
once
.
They
were
unwilling
to
keep
*NL*
her
any
longer
,
out
of
work
.
She
did
not
blame
Minnie
,
she
did
not
blame
*NL*
Hanson
very
much
.
Now
,
as
she
sat
there
digesting
the
remark
,
she
was
*NL*
glad
she
had
Drouet
's
money
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
after
a
few
moments
,
``
I
*NL*
thought
of
doing
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
explain
that
the
thought
,
however
,
had
aroused
all
the
*NL*
antagonism
of
her
nature
.
Columbia
City
,
what
was
there
for
her
?
She
*NL*
knew
its
dull
,
little
round
by
heart
.
Here
was
the
great
,
mysterious
*NL*
city
which
was
still
a
magnet
for
her
.
What
she
had
seen
only
suggested
*NL*
its
possibilities
.
Now
to
turn
back
on
it
and
live
the
little
old
life
*NL*
out
there
--
she
almost
exclaimed
against
the
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
reached
home
early
and
went
in
the
front
room
to
think
.
What
*NL*
could
she
do
?
She
could
not
buy
new
shoes
and
wear
them
here
.
She
would
*NL*
need
to
save
part
of
the
twenty
to
pay
her
fare
home
.
She
did
not
want
*NL*
to
borrow
of
Minnie
for
that
.
And
yet
,
how
could
she
explain
where
she
*NL*
even
got
that
money
?
If
she
could
only
get
enough
to
let
her
out
easy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
over
the
tangle
again
and
again
.
Here
,
in
the
morning
,
Drouet
*NL*
would
expect
to
see
her
in
a
new
jacket
,
and
that
could
n't
be
.
The
*NL*
Hansons
expected
her
to
go
home
,
and
she
wanted
to
get
away
,
and
yet
she
*NL*
did
not
want
to
go
home
.
In
the
light
of
the
way
they
would
look
on
her
*NL*
getting
money
without
work
,
the
taking
of
it
now
seemed
dreadful
.
She
*NL*
began
to
be
ashamed
.
The
whole
situation
depressed
her
.
It
was
all
*NL*
so
clear
when
she
was
with
Drouet
.
Now
it
was
all
so
tangled
,
so
*NL*
hopeless
--
much
worse
than
it
was
before
,
because
she
had
the
semblance
*NL*
of
aid
in
her
hand
which
she
could
not
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
spirits
sank
so
that
at
supper
Minnie
felt
that
she
must
have
had
*NL*
another
hard
day
.
Carrie
finally
decided
that
she
would
give
the
money
*NL*
back
.
It
was
wrong
to
take
it
.
She
would
go
down
in
the
morning
and
hunt
*NL*
for
work
.
At
noon
she
would
meet
Drouet
as
agreed
and
tell
him
.
At
this
*NL*
decision
her
heart
sank
,
until
she
was
the
old
Carrie
of
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curiously
,
she
could
not
hold
the
money
in
her
hand
without
feeling
some
*NL*
relief
.
Even
after
all
her
depressing
conclusions
,
she
could
sweep
*NL*
away
all
thought
about
the
matter
and
then
the
twenty
dollars
seemed
a
*NL*
wonderful
and
delightful
thing
.
Ah
,
money
,
money
,
money
!
What
a
thing
it
*NL*
was
to
have
.
How
plenty
of
it
would
clear
away
all
these
troubles
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
she
got
up
and
started
out
a
little
early
.
Her
decision
*NL*
to
hunt
for
work
was
moderately
strong
,
but
the
money
in
her
pocket
,
*NL*
after
all
her
troubling
over
it
,
made
the
work
question
the
least
*NL*
shade
less
terrible
.
She
walked
into
the
wholesale
district
,
but
as
the
*NL*
thought
of
applying
came
with
each
passing
concern
,
her
heart
shrank
.
*NL*
What
a
coward
she
was
,
she
thought
to
herself
.
Yet
she
had
applied
so
*NL*
often
.
It
would
be
the
same
old
story
.
She
walked
on
and
on
,
and
finally
*NL*
did
go
into
one
place
,
with
the
old
result
.
She
came
out
feeling
that
*NL*
luck
was
against
her
.
It
was
no
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
much
thinking
,
she
reached
Dearborn
Street
.
Here
was
the
great
*NL*
Fair
store
with
its
multitude
of
delivery
wagons
about
its
long
window
*NL*
display
,
its
crowd
of
shoppers
.
It
readily
changed
her
thoughts
,
she
who
*NL*
was
so
weary
of
them
.
It
was
here
that
she
had
intended
to
come
and
get
*NL*
her
new
things
.
Now
for
relief
from
distress
;
she
thought
she
would
go
*NL*
in
and
see
.
She
would
look
at
the
jackets
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
in
this
world
more
delightful
than
that
middle
state
*NL*
in
which
we
mentally
balance
at
times
,
possessed
of
the
means
,
lured
by
*NL*
desire
,
and
yet
deterred
by
conscience
or
want
of
decision
.
When
Carrie
*NL*
began
wandering
around
the
store
amid
the
fine
displays
she
was
in
this
*NL*
mood
.
Her
original
experience
in
this
same
place
had
given
her
a
high
*NL*
opinion
of
its
merits
.
Now
she
paused
at
each
individual
bit
of
finery
,
*NL*
where
before
she
had
hurried
on
.
Her
woman
's
heart
was
warm
with
desire
*NL*
for
them
.
How
would
she
look
in
this
,
how
charming
that
would
make
her
!
*NL*
She
came
upon
the
corset
counter
and
paused
in
rich
reverie
as
she
noted
*NL*
the
dainty
concoctions
of
colour
and
lace
there
displayed
.
If
she
would
*NL*
only
make
up
her
mind
,
she
could
have
one
of
those
now
.
She
lingered
in
*NL*
the
jewelry
department
.
She
saw
the
earrings
,
the
bracelets
,
the
pins
,
*NL*
the
chains
.
What
would
she
not
have
given
if
she
could
have
had
them
*NL*
all
!
She
would
look
fine
too
,
if
only
she
had
some
of
these
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
jackets
were
the
greatest
attraction
.
When
she
entered
the
store
,
*NL*
she
already
had
her
heart
fixed
upon
the
peculiar
little
tan
jacket
with
*NL*
large
mother-of-pearl
buttons
which
was
all
the
rage
that
fall
.
Still
*NL*
she
delighted
to
convince
herself
that
there
was
nothing
she
would
*NL*
like
better
.
She
went
about
among
the
glass
cases
and
racks
where
these
*NL*
things
were
displayed
,
and
satisfied
herself
that
the
one
she
thought
*NL*
of
was
the
proper
one
.
All
the
time
she
wavered
in
mind
,
now
persuading
*NL*
herself
that
she
could
buy
it
right
away
if
she
chose
,
now
recalling
*NL*
to
herself
the
actual
condition
.
At
last
the
noon
hour
was
dangerously
*NL*
near
,
and
she
had
done
nothing
.
She
must
go
now
and
return
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
was
on
the
corner
when
she
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
''
he
said
,
``
where
is
the
jacket
and
''
--
looking
down
--
``
the
shoes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
thought
to
lead
up
to
her
decision
in
some
intelligent
way
,
*NL*
but
this
swept
the
whole
fore-schemed
situation
by
the
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
to
tell
you
that
--
that
I
ca
n't
take
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
it
,
is
it
?
''
he
returned
.
``
Well
,
you
come
on
with
me
.
Let
's
*NL*
go
over
here
to
Partridge
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
walked
with
him
.
Behold
,
the
whole
fabric
of
doubt
and
*NL*
impossibility
had
slipped
from
her
mind
.
She
could
not
get
at
the
points
*NL*
that
were
so
serious
,
the
things
she
was
going
to
make
plain
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
had
lunch
yet
?
Of
course
you
have
n't
.
Let
's
go
in
here
,
''
and
*NL*
Drouet
turned
into
one
of
the
very
nicely
furnished
restaurants
off
*NL*
State
Street
,
in
Monroe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
n't
take
the
money
,
''
said
Carrie
,
after
they
were
settled
in
*NL*
a
cosey
corner
,
and
Drouet
had
ordered
the
lunch
.
``
I
ca
n't
wear
those
*NL*
things
out
there
.
They
--
they
would
n't
know
where
I
got
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
to
do
,
''
he
smiled
,
``
go
without
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'll
go
home
,
''
she
said
,
wearily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
've
been
thinking
it
over
too
long
.
I
'll
tell
*NL*
you
what
you
do
.
You
say
you
ca
n't
wear
them
out
there
.
Why
do
n't
you
*NL*
rent
a
furnished
room
and
leave
them
in
that
for
a
week
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
shook
her
head
.
Like
all
women
,
she
was
there
to
object
and
be
*NL*
convinced
.
It
was
for
him
to
brush
the
doubts
away
and
clear
the
path
if
*NL*
he
could
.
``
Why
are
you
going
home
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
get
anything
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
keep
you
?
''
he
remarked
,
intuitively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ca
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
do
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
come
with
me
.
I
'll
take
care
*NL*
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
heard
this
passively
.
The
peculiar
state
which
she
was
in
made
it
*NL*
sound
like
the
welcome
breath
of
an
open
door
.
Drouet
seemed
of
her
*NL*
own
spirit
and
pleasing
.
He
was
clean
,
handsome
,
well-dressed
,
and
*NL*
sympathetic
.
His
voice
was
the
voice
of
a
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
do
back
at
Columbia
City
?
''
he
went
on
,
rousing
by
the
*NL*
words
in
Carrie
's
mind
a
picture
of
the
dull
world
she
had
left
.
``
There
*NL*
is
n't
anything
down
there
.
Chicago
's
the
place
.
You
can
get
a
nice
room
*NL*
here
and
some
clothes
,
and
then
you
can
do
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
out
through
the
window
into
the
busy
street
.
There
it
was
,
*NL*
the
admirable
,
great
city
,
so
fine
when
you
are
not
poor
.
An
elegant
*NL*
coach
,
with
a
prancing
pair
of
bays
,
passed
by
,
carrying
in
its
*NL*
upholstered
depths
a
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
you
have
if
you
go
back
?
''
asked
Drouet
.
There
was
no
subtle
*NL*
undercurrent
to
the
question
.
He
imagined
that
she
would
have
nothing
at
*NL*
all
of
the
things
he
thought
worth
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
sat
still
,
looking
out
.
She
was
wondering
what
she
could
do
.
They
*NL*
would
be
expecting
her
to
go
home
this
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
turned
to
the
subject
of
the
clothes
she
was
going
to
buy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
get
yourself
a
nice
little
jacket
?
You
've
got
to
have
it
.
*NL*
I
'll
loan
you
the
money
.
You
need
n't
worry
about
taking
it
.
You
can
get
*NL*
yourself
a
nice
room
by
yourself
.
I
wo
n't
hurt
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
saw
the
drift
,
but
could
not
express
her
thoughts
.
She
felt
more
*NL*
than
ever
the
helplessness
of
her
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
only
get
something
to
do
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
you
can
,
''
went
on
Drouet
,
``
if
you
stay
here
.
You
ca
n't
if
you
go
*NL*
away
.
They
wo
n't
let
you
stay
out
there
.
Now
,
why
not
let
me
get
you
a
*NL*
nice
room
?
I
wo
n't
bother
you
--
you
need
n't
be
afraid
.
Then
,
when
you
get
*NL*
fixed
up
,
maybe
you
could
get
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
pretty
face
and
it
vivified
his
mental
resources
.
She
*NL*
was
a
sweet
little
mortal
to
him
--
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
.
She
seemed
*NL*
to
have
some
power
back
of
her
actions
.
She
was
not
like
the
common
run
*NL*
of
store-girls
.
She
was
n't
silly
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reality
,
Carrie
had
more
imagination
than
he
--
more
taste
.
It
was
*NL*
a
finer
mental
strain
in
her
that
made
possible
her
depression
*NL*
and
loneliness
.
Her
poor
clothes
were
neat
,
and
she
held
her
head
*NL*
unconsciously
in
a
dainty
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
I
could
get
something
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
he
said
,
reaching
over
and
filling
her
cup
with
tea
.
``
I
'll
help
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
and
he
laughed
reassuringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
'll
tell
you
what
we
'll
do
.
We
'll
go
over
here
to
Partridge
's
and
*NL*
you
pick
out
what
you
want
.
Then
we
'll
look
around
for
a
room
for
you
.
*NL*
You
can
leave
the
things
there
.
Then
we
'll
go
to
the
show
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
go
out
to
the
flat
then
,
that
's
all
right
.
You
do
n't
need
*NL*
to
stay
in
the
room
.
Just
take
it
and
leave
your
things
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hung
in
doubt
about
this
until
the
dinner
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
over
and
look
at
the
jackets
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Together
they
went
.
In
the
store
they
found
that
shine
and
rustle
of
*NL*
new
things
which
immediately
laid
hold
of
Carrie
's
heart
.
Under
the
*NL*
influence
of
a
good
dinner
and
Drouet
's
radiating
presence
,
the
scheme
*NL*
proposed
seemed
feasible
.
She
looked
about
and
picked
a
jacket
like
the
*NL*
one
which
she
had
admired
at
The
Fair
.
When
she
got
it
in
her
hand
it
*NL*
seemed
so
much
nicer
.
The
saleswoman
helped
her
on
with
it
,
and
,
by
*NL*
accident
,
it
fitted
perfectly
.
Drouet
's
face
lightened
as
he
saw
the
*NL*
improvement
.
She
looked
quite
smart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
thing
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
turned
before
the
glass
.
She
could
not
help
feeling
pleased
as
*NL*
she
looked
at
herself
.
A
warm
glow
crept
into
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
thing
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
Now
pay
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nine
dollars
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
--
take
it
,
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
reached
in
her
purse
and
took
out
one
of
the
bills
.
The
woman
asked
*NL*
if
she
would
wear
the
coat
and
went
off
.
In
a
few
minutes
she
was
back
*NL*
and
the
purchase
was
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Partridge
's
they
went
to
a
shoe
store
,
where
Carrie
was
fitted
*NL*
for
shoes
.
Drouet
stood
by
,
and
when
he
saw
how
nice
they
looked
,
*NL*
said
,
``
Wear
them
.
''
Carrie
shook
her
head
,
however
.
She
was
thinking
of
*NL*
returning
to
the
flat
.
He
bought
her
a
purse
for
one
thing
,
and
a
pair
*NL*
of
gloves
for
another
,
and
let
her
buy
the
stockings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
come
down
here
and
buy
yourself
a
skirt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
of
Carrie
's
actions
there
was
a
touch
of
misgiving
.
The
deeper
*NL*
she
sank
into
the
entanglement
,
the
more
she
imagined
that
the
thing
*NL*
hung
upon
the
few
remaining
things
she
had
not
done
.
Since
she
had
not
*NL*
done
these
,
there
was
a
way
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
knew
a
place
in
Wabash
Avenue
where
there
were
rooms
.
He
showed
*NL*
Carrie
the
outside
of
these
,
and
said
:
``
Now
,
you
're
my
sister
.
''
He
*NL*
carried
the
arrangement
off
with
an
easy
hand
when
it
came
to
the
*NL*
selection
,
looking
around
,
criticising
,
opining
.
``
Her
trunk
will
be
here
*NL*
in
a
day
or
so
,
''
he
observed
to
the
landlady
,
who
was
very
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
alone
,
Drouet
did
not
change
in
the
least
.
He
talked
in
*NL*
the
same
general
way
as
if
they
were
out
in
the
street
.
Carrie
left
her
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Drouet
,
``
why
do
n't
you
move
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
them
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
that
up
as
they
walked
along
the
avenue
.
It
was
a
warm
*NL*
afternoon
.
The
sun
had
come
out
and
the
wind
had
died
down
.
As
he
talked
*NL*
with
Carrie
,
he
secured
an
accurate
detail
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
*NL*
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
out
of
it
,
''
he
said
,
``
they
wo
n't
care
.
I
'll
help
you
get
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
until
her
misgivings
vanished
.
He
would
show
her
about
*NL*
a
little
and
then
help
her
get
something
.
He
really
imagined
that
he
*NL*
would
.
He
would
be
out
on
the
road
and
she
could
be
working
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
do
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
go
out
there
and
get
*NL*
whatever
you
want
and
come
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
a
long
time
about
this
.
Finally
she
agreed
.
He
would
come
*NL*
out
as
far
as
Peoria
Street
and
wait
for
her
.
She
was
to
meet
him
at
*NL*
half-past
eight
.
At
half-past
five
she
reached
home
,
and
at
six
her
*NL*
determination
was
hardened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
did
n't
get
it
?
''
said
Minnie
,
referring
to
Carrie
's
story
of
the
*NL*
Boston
Store
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
her
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
.
``
No
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
'd
better
try
any
more
this
fall
,
''
said
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Hanson
came
home
he
wore
the
same
inscrutable
demeanour
.
He
washed
*NL*
in
silence
and
went
off
to
read
his
paper
.
At
dinner
Carrie
felt
a
*NL*
little
nervous
.
The
strain
of
her
own
plans
were
considerable
,
and
the
*NL*
feeling
that
she
was
not
welcome
here
was
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
find
anything
,
eh
?
''
said
Hanson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
his
eating
again
,
the
thought
that
it
was
a
burden
to
have
*NL*
her
here
dwelling
in
his
mind
.
She
would
have
to
go
home
,
that
was
all
.
*NL*
Once
she
was
away
,
there
would
be
no
more
coming
back
in
the
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
afraid
of
what
she
was
going
to
do
,
but
she
was
relieved
*NL*
to
know
that
this
condition
was
ending
.
They
would
not
care
.
Hanson
*NL*
particularly
would
be
glad
when
she
went
.
He
would
not
care
what
became
*NL*
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
she
went
into
the
bathroom
,
where
they
could
not
disturb
*NL*
her
,
and
wrote
a
little
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
Minnie
,
''
it
read
.
``
I
'm
not
going
home
.
I
'm
going
to
stay
*NL*
in
Chicago
a
little
while
and
look
for
work
.
Do
n't
worry
.
I
'll
be
all
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
front
room
Hanson
was
reading
his
paper
.
As
usual
,
she
helped
*NL*
Minnie
clear
away
the
dishes
and
straighten
up
.
Then
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
I
'll
stand
down
at
the
door
a
little
while
.
''
She
could
scarcely
*NL*
prevent
her
voice
from
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
remembered
Hanson
's
remonstrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sven
does
n't
think
it
looks
good
to
stand
down
there
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
he
?
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
wo
n't
do
it
any
more
after
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
on
her
hat
and
fidgeted
around
the
table
in
the
little
bedroom
,
*NL*
wondering
where
to
slip
the
note
.
Finally
she
put
it
under
Minnie
's
*NL*
hair-brush
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
closed
the
hall-door
,
she
paused
a
moment
and
wondered
what
*NL*
they
would
think
.
Some
thought
of
the
queerness
of
her
deed
affected
*NL*
her
.
She
went
slowly
down
the
stairs
.
She
looked
back
up
the
lighted
*NL*
step
,
and
then
affected
to
stroll
up
the
street
.
When
she
reached
the
*NL*
corner
she
quickened
her
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
hurrying
away
,
Hanson
came
back
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Carrie
down
at
the
door
again
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Minnie
;
``
she
said
she
was
n't
going
to
do
it
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
over
to
the
baby
where
it
was
playing
on
the
floor
and
began
to
*NL*
poke
his
finger
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
was
on
the
corner
waiting
,
in
good
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Carrie
,
''
he
said
,
as
a
sprightly
figure
of
a
girl
drew
near
him
.
*NL*
``
Got
here
safe
,
did
you
?
Well
,
we
'll
take
a
car
.

Chapter

INTIMATIONS
BY
WINTER
--
AN
AMBASSADOR
SUMMONED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
forces
which
sweep
and
play
throughout
the
universe
,
untutored
*NL*
man
is
but
a
wisp
in
the
wind
.
Our
civilisation
is
still
in
a
middle
*NL*
stage
,
scarcely
beast
,
in
that
it
is
no
longer
wholly
guided
by
*NL*
instinct
;
scarcely
human
,
in
that
it
is
not
yet
wholly
guided
by
reason
.
*NL*
On
the
tiger
no
responsibility
rests
.
We
see
him
aligned
by
nature
with
*NL*
the
forces
of
life
--
he
is
born
into
their
keeping
and
without
thought
he
*NL*
is
protected
.
We
see
man
far
removed
from
the
lairs
of
the
jungles
,
*NL*
his
innate
instincts
dulled
by
too
near
an
approach
to
free-will
,
his
*NL*
free-will
not
sufficiently
developed
to
replace
his
instincts
and
afford
*NL*
him
perfect
guidance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
becoming
too
wise
to
hearken
always
to
instincts
and
desires
;
he
*NL*
is
still
too
weak
to
always
prevail
against
them
.
As
a
beast
,
the
forces
*NL*
of
life
aligned
him
with
them
;
as
a
man
,
he
has
not
yet
wholly
learned
*NL*
to
align
himself
with
the
forces
.
In
this
intermediate
stage
he
*NL*
wavers
--
neither
drawn
in
harmony
with
nature
by
his
instincts
nor
yet
*NL*
wisely
putting
himself
into
harmony
by
his
own
free-will
.
He
is
even
as
*NL*
a
wisp
in
the
wind
,
moved
by
every
breath
of
passion
,
acting
now
by
his
*NL*
will
and
now
by
his
instincts
,
erring
with
one
,
only
to
retrieve
by
*NL*
the
other
,
falling
by
one
,
only
to
rise
by
the
other
--
a
creature
of
*NL*
incalculable
variability
.
We
have
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
*NL*
evolution
is
ever
in
action
,
that
the
ideal
is
a
light
that
can
not
fail
.
*NL*
He
will
not
forever
balance
thus
between
good
and
evil
.
When
this
jangle
*NL*
of
free-will
instinct
shall
have
been
adjusted
,
when
perfect
under
*NL*
standing
has
given
the
former
the
power
to
replace
the
latter
entirely
,
*NL*
man
will
no
longer
vary
.
The
needle
of
understanding
will
yet
point
*NL*
steadfast
and
unwavering
to
the
distinct
pole
of
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Carrie
--
as
in
how
many
of
our
worldlings
do
they
not
?
--
instinct
*NL*
and
reason
,
desire
and
understanding
,
were
at
war
for
the
mastery
.
She
*NL*
followed
whither
her
craving
led
.
She
was
as
yet
more
drawn
than
she
*NL*
drew
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Minnie
found
the
note
next
morning
,
after
a
night
of
mingled
wonder
*NL*
and
anxiety
,
which
was
not
exactly
touched
by
yearning
,
sorrow
,
or
love
,
*NL*
she
exclaimed
:
``
Well
,
what
do
you
think
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Hanson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
Carrie
has
gone
to
live
somewhere
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hanson
jumped
out
of
bed
with
more
celerity
than
he
usually
displayed
*NL*
and
looked
at
the
note
.
The
only
indication
of
his
thoughts
came
in
*NL*
the
form
of
a
little
clicking
sound
made
by
his
tongue
;
the
sound
some
*NL*
people
make
when
they
wish
to
urge
on
a
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
suppose
she
's
gone
to
?
''
said
Minnie
,
thoroughly
aroused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
a
touch
of
cynicism
lighting
his
eye
.
``
Now
she
has
gone
*NL*
and
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
moved
her
head
in
a
puzzled
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
,
''
she
said
,
``
she
does
n't
know
what
she
has
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Hanson
,
after
a
while
,
sticking
his
hands
out
before
him
,
*NL*
``
what
can
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
's
womanly
nature
was
higher
than
this
.
She
figured
the
*NL*
possibilities
in
such
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
``
poor
Sister
Carrie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
of
this
particular
conversation
,
which
occurred
at
5
A.M.
,
*NL*
that
little
soldier
of
fortune
was
sleeping
a
rather
troubled
sleep
in
*NL*
her
new
room
,
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
's
new
state
was
remarkable
in
that
she
saw
possibilities
in
it
.
*NL*
She
was
no
sensualist
,
longing
to
drowse
sleepily
in
the
lap
of
luxury
.
*NL*
She
turned
about
,
troubled
by
her
daring
,
glad
of
her
release
,
wondering
*NL*
whether
she
would
get
something
to
do
,
wondering
what
Drouet
would
do
.
*NL*
That
worthy
had
his
future
fixed
for
him
beyond
a
peradventure
.
He
could
*NL*
not
help
what
he
was
going
to
do
.
He
could
not
see
clearly
enough
to
*NL*
wish
to
do
differently
.
He
was
drawn
by
his
innate
desire
to
act
the
old
*NL*
pursuing
part
.
He
would
need
to
delight
himself
with
Carrie
as
surely
*NL*
as
he
would
need
to
eat
his
heavy
breakfast
.
He
might
suffer
the
least
*NL*
rudimentary
twinge
of
conscience
in
whatever
he
did
,
and
in
just
so
far
*NL*
he
was
evil
and
sinning
.
But
whatever
twinges
of
conscience
he
might
*NL*
have
would
be
rudimentary
,
you
may
be
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
he
called
upon
Carrie
,
and
she
saw
him
in
her
chamber
.
He
*NL*
was
the
same
jolly
,
enlivening
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
,
''
he
said
,
``
what
are
you
looking
so
blue
about
?
Come
on
out
to
*NL*
breakfast
.
You
want
to
get
your
other
clothes
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
with
the
hue
of
shifting
thought
in
her
large
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
get
something
to
do
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
get
that
all
right
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
What
's
the
use
worrying
right
*NL*
now
?
Get
yourself
fixed
up
.
See
the
city
.
I
wo
n't
hurt
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
wo
n't
,
''
she
remarked
,
half
truthfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
on
the
new
shoes
,
have
n't
you
?
Stick
'em
out
.
George
,
they
look
*NL*
fine
.
Put
on
your
jacket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
that
fits
like
a
T
,
do
n't
it
?
''
he
remarked
,
feeling
the
set
of
it
*NL*
at
the
waist
and
eyeing
it
from
a
few
paces
with
real
pleasure
.
``
What
*NL*
you
need
now
is
a
new
skirt
.
Let
's
go
to
breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
put
on
her
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
the
gloves
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
she
said
,
taking
them
out
of
the
bureau
drawer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
come
on
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
first
hour
of
misgiving
was
swept
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
went
this
way
on
every
occasion
.
Drouet
did
not
leave
her
much
alone
.
*NL*
She
had
time
for
some
lone
wanderings
,
but
mostly
he
filled
her
hours
*NL*
with
sight-seeing
.
At
Carson
,
Pirie
's
he
bought
her
a
nice
skirt
and
*NL*
shirt
waist
.
With
his
money
she
purchased
the
little
necessaries
of
*NL*
toilet
,
until
at
last
she
looked
quite
another
maiden
.
The
mirror
*NL*
convinced
her
of
a
few
things
which
she
had
long
believed
.
She
was
*NL*
pretty
,
yes
,
indeed
!
How
nice
her
hat
set
,
and
were
n't
her
eyes
pretty
.
*NL*
She
caught
her
little
red
lip
with
her
teeth
and
felt
her
first
thrill
*NL*
of
power
.
Drouet
was
so
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
to
see
``
The
Mikado
''
one
evening
,
an
opera
which
was
*NL*
hilariously
popular
at
that
time
.
Before
going
,
they
made
off
for
*NL*
the
Windsor
dining-room
,
which
was
in
Dearborn
Street
,
a
considerable
*NL*
distance
from
Carrie
's
room
.
It
was
blowing
up
cold
,
and
out
of
her
*NL*
window
Carrie
could
see
the
western
sky
,
still
pink
with
the
fading
*NL*
light
,
but
steely
blue
at
the
top
where
it
met
the
darkness
.
A
long
,
*NL*
thin
cloud
of
pink
hung
in
midair
,
shaped
like
some
island
in
a
far-off
*NL*
sea
.
Somehow
the
swaying
of
some
dead
branches
of
trees
across
the
way
*NL*
brought
back
the
picture
with
which
she
was
familiar
when
she
looked
*NL*
from
their
front
window
in
December
days
at
home
.
She
paused
and
wrung
*NL*
her
little
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
,
her
lip
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sensed
something
,
and
slipped
his
arm
over
her
shoulder
,
patting
her
*NL*
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
''
he
said
gently
,
``
you
're
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
slip
on
her
jacket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
wear
that
boa
about
your
throat
to
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
north
on
Wabash
to
Adams
Street
and
then
west
.
The
lights
*NL*
in
the
stores
were
already
shining
out
in
gushes
of
golden
hue
.
The
arc
*NL*
lights
were
sputtering
overhead
,
and
high
up
were
the
lighted
windows
*NL*
of
the
tall
office
buildings
.
The
chill
wind
whipped
in
and
out
in
gusty
*NL*
breaths
.
Homeward
bound
,
the
six
o'clock
throng
bumped
and
jostled
.
*NL*
Light
overcoats
were
turned
up
about
the
ears
,
hats
were
pulled
down
.
*NL*
Little
shop-girls
went
fluttering
by
in
pairs
and
fours
,
chattering
,
*NL*
laughing
.
It
was
a
spectacle
of
warm-blooded
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
pair
of
eyes
met
Carrie
's
in
recognition
.
They
were
looking
*NL*
out
from
a
group
of
poorly
dressed
girls
.
Their
clothes
were
faded
and
*NL*
loose-hanging
,
their
jackets
old
,
their
general
make-up
shabby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
recognised
the
glance
and
the
girl
.
She
was
one
of
those
who
*NL*
worked
at
the
machines
in
the
shoe
factory
.
The
latter
looked
,
not
quite
*NL*
sure
,
and
then
turned
her
head
and
looked
.
Carrie
felt
as
if
some
great
*NL*
tide
had
rolled
between
them
.
The
old
dress
and
the
old
machine
came
*NL*
back
.
She
actually
started
.
Drouet
did
n't
notice
until
Carrie
bumped
*NL*
into
a
pedestrian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
thinking
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
dined
and
went
to
the
theatre
.
That
spectacle
pleased
Carrie
*NL*
immensely
.
The
colour
and
grace
of
it
caught
her
eye
.
She
had
vain
*NL*
imaginings
about
place
and
power
,
about
far-off
lands
and
magnificent
*NL*
people
.
When
it
was
over
,
the
clatter
of
coaches
and
the
throng
of
fine
*NL*
ladies
made
her
stare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
minute
,
''
said
Drouet
,
holding
her
back
in
the
showy
foyer
where
*NL*
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
moving
in
a
social
crush
,
skirts
rustling
,
*NL*
lace-covered
heads
nodding
,
white
teeth
showing
through
parted
lips
.
*NL*
``
Let
's
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixty-seven
,
''
the
coach-caller
was
saying
,
his
voice
lifted
in
a
sort
*NL*
of
euphonious
cry
.
``
Sixty-seven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
fine
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
,
''
said
Drouet
.
He
was
as
much
affected
by
this
show
of
finery
and
*NL*
gayety
as
she
.
He
pressed
her
arm
warmly
.
Once
she
looked
up
,
her
even
*NL*
teeth
glistening
through
her
smiling
lips
,
her
eyes
alight
.
As
they
were
*NL*
moving
out
he
whispered
down
to
her
,
``
You
look
lovely
!
''
They
were
right
*NL*
where
the
coach-caller
was
swinging
open
a
coach-door
and
ushering
in
*NL*
two
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stick
to
me
and
we
'll
have
a
coach
,
''
laughed
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
scarcely
heard
,
her
head
was
so
full
of
the
swirl
of
life
.
They
*NL*
stopped
in
at
a
restaurant
for
a
little
after-theatre
lunch
.
Just
a
*NL*
shade
of
a
thought
of
the
hour
entered
Carrie
's
head
,
but
there
was
no
*NL*
household
law
to
govern
her
now
.
If
any
habits
ever
had
time
to
fix
upon
*NL*
her
,
they
would
have
operated
here
.
Habits
are
peculiar
things
.
They
*NL*
will
drive
the
really
non-religious
mind
out
of
bed
to
say
prayers
that
*NL*
are
only
a
custom
and
not
a
devotion
.
The
victim
of
habit
,
when
he
*NL*
has
neglected
the
thing
which
it
was
his
custom
to
do
,
feels
a
little
*NL*
scratching
in
the
brain
,
a
little
irritating
something
which
comes
of
*NL*
being
out
of
the
rut
,
and
imagines
it
to
be
the
prick
of
conscience
,
*NL*
the
still
,
small
voice
that
is
urging
him
ever
to
righteousness
.
If
the
*NL*
digression
is
unusual
enough
,
the
drag
of
habit
will
be
heavy
enough
*NL*
to
cause
the
unreasoning
victim
to
return
and
perform
the
perfunctory
*NL*
thing
.
``
Now
,
bless
me
,
''
says
such
a
mind
,
``
I
have
done
my
duty
,
''
when
,
*NL*
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
it
has
merely
done
its
old
,
unbreakable
trick
once
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
no
excellent
home
principles
fixed
upon
her
.
If
she
had
,
she
*NL*
would
have
been
more
consciously
distressed
.
Now
the
lunch
went
off
with
*NL*
considerable
warmth
.
Under
the
influence
of
the
varied
occurrences
,
the
*NL*
fine
,
invisible
passion
which
was
emanating
from
Drouet
,
the
food
,
the
*NL*
still
unusual
luxury
,
she
relaxed
and
heard
with
open
ears
.
She
was
*NL*
again
the
victim
of
the
city
's
hypnotic
influence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Drouet
at
last
,
``
we
had
better
be
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
dawdling
over
the
dishes
,
and
their
eyes
had
frequently
*NL*
met
.
Carrie
could
not
help
but
feel
the
vibration
of
force
which
*NL*
followed
,
which
,
indeed
,
was
his
gaze
.
He
had
a
way
of
touching
her
hand
*NL*
in
explanation
,
as
if
to
impress
a
fact
upon
her
.
He
touched
it
now
as
*NL*
he
spoke
of
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
arose
and
went
out
into
the
street
.
The
downtown
section
was
now
*NL*
bare
,
save
for
a
few
whistling
strollers
,
a
few
owl
cars
,
a
few
*NL*
open
resorts
whose
windows
were
still
bright
.
Out
Wabash
Avenue
they
*NL*
strolled
,
Drouet
still
pouring
forth
his
volume
of
small
information
.
He
*NL*
had
Carrie
's
arm
in
his
,
and
held
it
closely
as
he
explained
.
Once
in
a
*NL*
while
,
after
some
witticism
,
he
would
look
down
,
and
his
eyes
would
meet
*NL*
hers
.
At
last
they
came
to
the
steps
,
and
Carrie
stood
up
on
the
first
*NL*
one
,
her
head
now
coming
even
with
his
own
.
He
took
her
hand
and
held
it
*NL*
genially
.
He
looked
steadily
at
her
as
she
glanced
about
,
warmly
musing
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
that
hour
,
Minnie
was
soundly
sleeping
,
after
a
long
evening
*NL*
of
troubled
thought
.
She
had
her
elbow
in
an
awkward
position
under
her
*NL*
side
.
The
muscles
so
held
irritated
a
few
nerves
,
and
now
a
vague
scene
*NL*
floated
in
on
the
drowsy
mind
.
She
fancied
she
and
Carrie
were
somewhere
*NL*
beside
an
old
coal-mine
.
She
could
see
the
tall
runway
and
the
heap
*NL*
of
earth
and
coal
cast
out
.
There
was
a
deep
pit
,
into
which
they
were
*NL*
looking
;
they
could
see
the
curious
wet
stones
far
down
where
the
wall
*NL*
disappeared
in
vague
shadows
.
An
old
basket
,
used
for
descending
,
was
*NL*
hanging
there
,
fastened
by
a
worn
rope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
get
in
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Minnie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
come
on
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
pull
the
basket
over
,
and
now
,
in
spite
of
all
protest
,
she
*NL*
had
swung
over
and
was
going
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
,
''
she
called
,
``
Carrie
,
come
back
''
;
but
Carrie
was
far
down
now
*NL*
and
the
shadow
had
swallowed
her
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
moved
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
mystic
scenery
merged
queerly
and
the
place
was
by
waters
she
*NL*
had
never
seen
.
They
were
upon
some
board
or
ground
or
something
that
*NL*
reached
far
out
,
and
at
the
end
of
this
was
Carrie
.
They
looked
about
,
*NL*
and
now
the
thing
was
sinking
,
and
Minnie
heard
the
low
sip
of
the
*NL*
encroaching
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
Carrie
,
''
she
called
,
but
Carrie
was
reaching
farther
out
.
She
*NL*
seemed
to
recede
,
and
now
it
was
difficult
to
call
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
,
''
she
called
,
``
Carrie
,
''
but
her
own
voice
sounded
far
away
,
and
*NL*
the
strange
waters
were
blurring
everything
.
She
came
away
suffering
as
*NL*
though
she
had
lost
something
.
She
was
more
inexpressibly
sad
than
she
*NL*
had
ever
been
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
way
through
many
shifts
of
the
tired
brain
,
those
curious
*NL*
phantoms
of
the
spirit
slipping
in
,
blurring
strange
scenes
,
one
with
*NL*
the
other
.
The
last
one
made
her
cry
out
,
for
Carrie
was
slipping
away
*NL*
somewhere
over
a
rock
,
and
her
fingers
had
let
loose
and
she
had
seen
*NL*
her
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Minnie
!
What
's
the
matter
?
Here
,
wake
up
,
''
said
Hanson
,
disturbed
,
and
*NL*
shaking
her
by
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wha
--
what
's
the
matter
?
''
said
Minnie
,
drowsily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wake
up
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
turn
over
.
You
're
talking
in
your
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
or
so
later
Drouet
strolled
into
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
's
,
spruce
in
*NL*
dress
and
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Charley
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
looking
out
from
his
office
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
strolled
over
and
looked
in
upon
the
manager
at
his
desk
.
``
When
*NL*
do
you
go
out
on
the
road
again
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
soon
,
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
seen
much
of
you
this
trip
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
been
busy
,
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
some
few
minutes
on
general
topics
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
said
Drouet
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
,
``
I
want
you
to
come
*NL*
out
some
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
where
?
''
inquired
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
to
my
house
,
of
course
,
''
said
Drouet
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
looked
up
quizzically
,
the
least
suggestion
of
a
smile
*NL*
hovering
about
his
lips
.
He
studied
the
face
of
Drouet
in
his
wise
way
,
*NL*
and
then
with
the
demeanour
of
a
gentleman
,
said
:
``
Certainly
;
glad
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
have
a
nice
game
of
euchre

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
bring
a
nice
little
bottle
of
Sec

''
asked
Hurstwood
.
``
Certainly

*NL*
said
Drouet
.
``
I
'll
introduce
you

Hurstwood

Lincoln
Park
,
was
a
brick
*NL*
building
of
a
very
popular
type
then
,
a
three-story
affair
with
the
*NL*
first
floor
sunk
a
very
little
below
the
level
of
the
street
.
It
had
a
*NL*
large
bay
window
bulging
out
from
the
second
floor
,
and
was
graced
in
*NL*
front
by
a
small
grassy
plot
,
twenty-five
feet
wide
and
ten
feet
*NL*
deep
.
There
was
also
a
small
rear
yard
,
walled
in
by
the
fences
of
the
*NL*
neighbours
and
holding
a
stable
where
he
kept
his
horse
and
trap
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ten
rooms
of
the
house
were
occupied
by
himself
,
his
wife
Julia
,
and
*NL*
his
son
and
daughter
,
George
,
Jr.
,
and
Jessica
.
There
were
besides
*NL*
these
a
maid-servant
,
represented
from
time
to
time
by
girls
of
various
*NL*
extraction
,
for
Mrs.
Hurstwood
was
not
always
easy
to
please
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
I
let
Mary
go
yesterday
,
''
was
not
an
unfrequent
salutation
at
*NL*
the
dinner
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
was
his
only
reply
.
He
had
long
since
wearied
of
discussing
*NL*
the
rancorous
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lovely
home
atmosphere
is
one
of
the
flowers
of
the
world
,
than
*NL*
which
there
is
nothing
more
tender
,
nothing
more
delicate
,
nothing
more
*NL*
calculated
to
make
strong
and
just
the
natures
cradled
and
nourished
*NL*
within
it
.
Those
who
have
never
experienced
such
a
beneficent
influence
*NL*
will
not
understand
wherefore
the
tear
springs
glistening
to
the
eyelids
*NL*
at
some
strange
breath
in
lovely
music
.
The
mystic
chords
which
bind
and
*NL*
thrill
the
heart
of
the
nation
,
they
will
never
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
residence
could
scarcely
be
said
to
be
infused
with
this
*NL*
home
spirit
.
It
lacked
that
toleration
and
regard
without
which
the
*NL*
home
is
nothing
.
There
was
fine
furniture
,
arranged
as
soothingly
as
the
*NL*
artistic
perception
of
the
occupants
warranted
.
There
were
soft
rugs
,
*NL*
rich
,
upholstered
chairs
and
divans
,
a
grand
piano
,
a
marble
carving
of
*NL*
some
unknown
Venus
by
some
unknown
artist
,
and
a
number
of
small
bronzes
*NL*
gathered
from
heaven
knows
where
,
but
generally
sold
by
the
large
*NL*
furniture
houses
along
with
everything
else
which
goes
to
make
the
*NL*
``
perfectly
appointed
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
dining-room
stood
a
sideboard
laden
with
glistening
decanters
and
*NL*
other
utilities
and
ornaments
in
glass
,
the
arrangement
of
which
could
*NL*
not
be
questioned
.
Here
was
something
Hurstwood
knew
about
.
He
had
*NL*
studied
the
subject
for
years
in
his
business
.
He
took
no
little
*NL*
satisfaction
in
telling
each
Mary
,
shortly
after
she
arrived
,
something
*NL*
of
what
the
art
of
the
thing
required
.
He
was
not
garrulous
by
any
*NL*
means
.
On
the
contrary
,
there
was
a
fine
reserve
in
his
manner
*NL*
toward
the
entire
domestic
economy
of
his
life
which
was
all
that
is
*NL*
comprehended
by
the
popular
term
,
gentlemanly
.
He
would
not
argue
,
he
*NL*
would
not
talk
freely
.
In
his
manner
was
something
of
the
dogmatist
.
*NL*
What
he
could
not
correct
,
he
would
ignore
.
There
was
a
tendency
in
him
*NL*
to
walk
away
from
the
impossible
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
time
when
he
had
been
considerably
enamoured
of
his
Jessica
,
*NL*
especially
when
he
was
younger
and
more
confined
in
his
success
.
Now
,
*NL*
however
,
in
her
seventeenth
year
,
Jessica
had
developed
a
certain
amount
*NL*
of
reserve
and
independence
which
was
not
inviting
to
the
richest
form
*NL*
of
parental
devotion
.
She
was
in
the
high
school
,
and
had
notions
of
*NL*
life
which
were
decidedly
those
of
a
patrician
.
She
liked
nice
clothes
*NL*
and
urged
for
them
constantly
.
Thoughts
of
love
and
elegant
individual
*NL*
establishments
were
running
in
her
head
.
She
met
girls
at
the
high
*NL*
school
whose
parents
were
truly
rich
and
whose
fathers
had
standing
*NL*
locally
as
partners
or
owners
of
solid
businesses
.
These
girls
gave
*NL*
themselves
the
airs
befitting
the
thriving
domestic
establishments
from
*NL*
whence
they
issued
.
They
were
the
only
ones
of
the
school
about
whom
*NL*
Jessica
concerned
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Hurstwood
,
Jr.
,
was
in
his
twentieth
year
,
and
was
already
*NL*
connected
in
a
promising
capacity
with
a
large
real
estate
firm
.
He
*NL*
contributed
nothing
for
the
domestic
expenses
of
the
family
,
but
was
*NL*
thought
to
be
saving
his
money
to
invest
in
real
estate
.
He
had
some
*NL*
ability
,
considerable
vanity
,
and
a
love
of
pleasure
that
had
not
,
as
*NL*
yet
,
infringed
upon
his
duties
,
whatever
they
were
.
He
came
in
and
went
*NL*
out
,
pursuing
his
own
plans
and
fancies
,
addressing
a
few
words
to
his
*NL*
mother
occasionally
,
relating
some
little
incident
to
his
father
,
but
*NL*
for
the
most
part
confining
himself
to
those
generalities
with
which
*NL*
most
conversation
concerns
itself
.
He
was
not
laying
bare
his
*NL*
desires
for
any
one
to
see
.
He
did
not
find
any
one
in
the
house
who
*NL*
particularly
cared
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurstwood
was
the
type
of
woman
who
has
ever
endeavoured
to
*NL*
shine
and
has
been
more
or
less
chagrined
at
the
evidences
of
superior
*NL*
capability
in
this
direction
elsewhere
.
Her
knowledge
of
life
extended
*NL*
to
that
little
conventional
round
of
society
of
which
she
was
not
--
but
*NL*
longed
to
be
--
a
member
.
She
was
not
without
realisation
already
*NL*
that
this
thing
was
impossible
,
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
.
For
her
*NL*
daughter
,
she
hoped
better
things
.
Through
Jessica
she
might
rise
*NL*
a
little
.
Through
George
,
Jr.
's
,
possible
success
she
might
draw
to
*NL*
herself
the
privilege
of
pointing
proudly
.
Even
Hurstwood
was
doing
well
*NL*
enough
,
and
she
was
anxious
that
his
small
real
estate
adventures
should
*NL*
prosper
.
His
property
holdings
,
as
yet
,
were
rather
small
,
but
his
*NL*
income
was
pleasing
and
his
position
with
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
was
fixed
.
*NL*
Both
those
gentlemen
were
on
pleasant
and
rather
informal
terms
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
atmosphere
which
such
personalities
would
create
must
be
apparent
to
*NL*
all
.
It
worked
out
in
a
thousand
little
conversations
,
all
of
which
were
*NL*
of
the
same
calibre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
up
to
Fox
Lake
to-morrow
,
''
announced
George
,
Jr.
,
at
the
*NL*
dinner
table
one
Friday
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
going
on
up
there
?
''
queried
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eddie
Fahrway
's
got
a
new
steam
launch
,
and
he
wants
me
to
come
up
and
*NL*
see
how
it
works
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
did
it
cost
him
?
''
asked
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
over
two
thousand
dollars
.
He
says
it
's
a
dandy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
Fahrway
must
be
making
money
,
''
put
in
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
,
I
guess

Jack
told
me
they
were
shipping
Vegacura
to
Australia
*NL*
now

said
they
sent
a
whole
box
to
Cape
Town
last
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
think
of
that
!
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
,
``
and
only
four
years
ago
they
*NL*
had
that
basement
in
Madison
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jack
told
me
they
were
going
to
put
up
a
six-story
building
next
spring
*NL*
in
Robey
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
think
of
that
!
''
said
Jessica
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
particular
occasion
Hurstwood
wished
to
leave
early
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
I
'll
be
going
down
town
,
''
he
remarked
,
rising
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
going
to
McVicker
's
Monday
?
''
questioned
Mrs.
Hurstwood
,
without
*NL*
rising
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
on
dining
,
while
he
went
upstairs
for
his
hat
and
coat
.
*NL*
Presently
the
door
clicked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
papa
's
gone
,
''
said
Jessica
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
's
school
news
was
of
a
particular
stripe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
going
to
give
a
performance
in
the
Lyceum
,
upstairs
,
''
she
*NL*
reported
one
day
,
``
and
I
'm
going
to
be
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
?
''
said
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
'll
have
to
have
a
new
dress
.
Some
of
the
nicest
girls
in
the
*NL*
school
are
going
to
be
in
it
.
Miss
Palmer
is
going
to
take
the
part
of
*NL*
Portia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
?
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
got
that
Martha
Griswold
in
it
again
.
She
thinks
she
can
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
family
does
n't
amount
to
anything
,
does
it
?
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
*NL*
sympathetically
.
``
They
have
n't
anything
,
have
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
returned
Jessica
,
``
they
're
poor
as
church
mice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
distinguished
very
carefully
between
the
young
boys
of
the
school
,
*NL*
many
of
whom
were
attracted
by
her
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
?
''
she
remarked
to
her
mother
one
evening
;
``
that
*NL*
Herbert
Crane
tried
to
make
friends
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
,
my
dear
?
''
inquired
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
one
,
''
said
Jessica
,
pursing
her
pretty
lips
.
``
He
's
just
a
*NL*
student
there
.
He
has
n't
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
half
of
this
picture
came
when
young
Blyford
,
son
of
Blyford
,
*NL*
the
soap
manufacturer
,
walked
home
with
her
.
Mrs.
Hurstwood
was
on
the
*NL*
third
floor
,
sitting
in
a
rocking-chair
reading
,
and
happened
to
look
*NL*
out
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
that
with
you
,
Jessica
?
''
she
inquired
,
as
Jessica
came
*NL*
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Mr.
Blyford
,
mamma
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
he
wants
me
to
stroll
over
into
the
park
with
him
,
''
explained
*NL*
Jessica
,
a
little
flushed
with
running
up
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
``
Do
n't
be
gone
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
two
went
down
the
street
,
she
glanced
interestedly
out
of
the
*NL*
window
.
It
was
a
most
satisfactory
spectacle
indeed
,
most
satisfactory
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
atmosphere
Hurstwood
had
moved
for
a
number
of
years
,
not
*NL*
thinking
deeply
concerning
it
.
His
was
not
the
order
of
nature
to
*NL*
trouble
for
something
better
,
unless
the
better
was
immediately
and
*NL*
sharply
contrasted
.
As
it
was
,
he
received
and
gave
,
irritated
sometimes
*NL*
by
the
little
displays
of
selfish
indifference
,
pleased
at
times
by
some
*NL*
show
of
finery
which
supposedly
made
for
dignity
and
social
distinction
.
*NL*
The
life
of
the
resort
which
he
managed
was
his
life
.
There
he
spent
*NL*
most
of
his
time
.
When
he
went
home
evenings
the
house
looked
nice
.
*NL*
With
rare
exceptions
the
meals
were
acceptable
,
being
the
kind
that
an
*NL*
ordinary
servant
can
arrange
.
In
part
,
he
was
interested
in
the
talk
*NL*
of
his
son
and
daughter
,
who
always
looked
well
.
The
vanity
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Hurstwood
caused
her
to
keep
her
person
rather
showily
arrayed
,
but
to
*NL*
Hurstwood
this
was
much
better
than
plainness
.
There
was
no
love
lost
*NL*
between
them
.
There
was
no
great
feeling
of
dissatisfaction
.
Her
opinion
*NL*
on
any
subject
was
not
startling
.
They
did
not
talk
enough
together
*NL*
to
come
to
the
argument
of
any
one
point
.
In
the
accepted
and
popular
*NL*
phrase
,
she
had
her
ideas
and
he
had
his
.
Once
in
a
while
he
would
meet
*NL*
a
woman
whose
youth
,
sprightliness
,
and
humour
would
make
his
wife
seem
*NL*
rather
deficient
by
contrast
,
but
the
temporary
dissatisfaction
which
*NL*
such
an
encounter
might
arouse
would
be
counterbalanced
by
his
social
*NL*
position
and
a
certain
matter
of
policy
.
He
could
not
complicate
his
*NL*
home
life
,
because
it
might
affect
his
relations
with
his
employers
.
*NL*
They
wanted
no
scandals
.
A
man
,
to
hold
his
position
,
must
have
*NL*
a
dignified
manner
,
a
clean
record
,
a
respectable
home
anchorage
.
*NL*
Therefore
he
was
circumspect
in
all
he
did
,
and
whenever
he
appeared
in
*NL*
the
public
ways
in
the
afternoon
,
or
on
Sunday
,
it
was
with
his
wife
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
his
children
.
He
would
visit
the
local
resorts
,
or
those
*NL*
near
by
in
Wisconsin
,
and
spend
a
few
stiff
,
polished
days
strolling
*NL*
about
conventional
places
doing
conventional
things
.
He
knew
the
need
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
some
one
of
the
many
middle-class
individuals
whom
he
knew
,
who
had
*NL*
money
,
would
get
into
trouble
,
he
would
shake
his
head
.
It
did
n't
do
to
*NL*
talk
about
those
things
.
If
it
came
up
for
discussion
among
such
friends
*NL*
as
with
him
passed
for
close
,
he
would
deprecate
the
folly
of
the
thing
.
*NL*
``
It
was
all
right
to
do
it
--
all
men
do
those
things
--
but
why
was
n't
he
*NL*
careful
?
A
man
ca
n't
be
too
careful
.
''
He
lost
sympathy
for
the
man
that
*NL*
made
a
mistake
and
was
found
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
account
he
still
devoted
some
time
to
showing
his
wife
*NL*
about
--
time
which
would
have
been
wearisome
indeed
if
it
had
not
been
*NL*
for
the
people
he
would
meet
and
the
little
enjoyments
which
did
not
*NL*
depend
upon
her
presence
or
absence
.
He
watched
her
with
considerable
*NL*
curiosity
at
times
,
for
she
was
still
attractive
in
a
way
and
men
*NL*
looked
at
her
.
She
was
affable
,
vain
,
subject
to
flattery
,
and
this
*NL*
combination
,
he
knew
quite
well
,
might
produce
a
tragedy
in
a
woman
of
*NL*
her
home
position
.
Owing
to
his
order
of
mind
,
his
confidence
in
the
sex
*NL*
was
not
great
.
His
wife
never
possessed
the
virtues
which
would
win
the
*NL*
confidence
and
admiration
of
a
man
of
his
nature
.
As
long
as
she
loved
*NL*
him
vigorously
he
could
see
how
confidence
could
be
,
but
when
that
was
*NL*
no
longer
the
binding
chain
--
well
,
something
might
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
last
year
or
two
the
expenses
of
the
family
seemed
a
large
*NL*
thing
.
Jessica
wanted
fine
clothes
,
and
Mrs.
Hurstwood
,
not
to
be
*NL*
outshone
by
her
daughter
,
also
frequently
enlivened
her
apparel
.
*NL*
Hurstwood
had
said
nothing
in
the
past
,
but
one
day
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jessica
must
have
a
new
dress
this
month
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
one
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
arraying
himself
in
one
of
his
perfection
vests
before
the
*NL*
glass
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
she
just
bought
one
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
just
something
for
evening
wear
,
''
returned
his
wife
*NL*
complacently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
,
''
returned
Hurstwood
,
``
that
she
's
spending
a
good
deal
*NL*
for
dresses
of
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
's
going
out
more
,
''
concluded
his
wife
,
but
the
tone
of
his
*NL*
voice
impressed
her
as
containing
something
she
had
not
heard
there
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
a
man
who
traveled
much
,
but
when
he
did
,
he
had
been
*NL*
accustomed
to
take
her
along
.
On
one
occasion
recently
a
local
*NL*
aldermanic
junket
had
been
arranged
to
visit
Philadelphia
--
a
junket
that
*NL*
was
to
last
ten
days
.
Hurstwood
had
been
invited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
knows
us
down
there
,
''
said
one
,
a
gentleman
whose
face
was
a
*NL*
slight
improvement
over
gross
ignorance
and
sensuality
.
He
always
wore
*NL*
a
silk
hat
of
most
imposing
proportions
.
``
We
can
have
a
good
time
.
''
*NL*
His
left
eye
moved
with
just
the
semblance
of
a
wink
.
``
You
want
to
come
*NL*
along
,
George
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Hurstwood
announced
his
intention
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
away
,
Julia
,
''
he
said
,
``
for
a
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
she
asked
,
looking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Philadelphia
,
on
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
consciously
,
expecting
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
to
leave
you
behind
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
she
replied
,
but
he
could
see
that
she
was
thinking
that
it
*NL*
was
a
curious
thing
.
Before
he
went
she
asked
him
a
few
more
questions
,
*NL*
and
that
irritated
him
.
He
began
to
feel
that
she
was
a
disagreeable
*NL*
attachment
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
trip
he
enjoyed
himself
thoroughly
,
and
when
it
was
over
he
*NL*
was
sorry
to
get
back
.
He
was
not
willingly
a
prevaricator
,
and
hated
*NL*
thoroughly
to
make
explanations
concerning
it
.
The
whole
incident
was
*NL*
glossed
over
with
general
remarks
,
but
Mrs.
Hurstwood
gave
the
subject
*NL*
considerable
thought
.
She
drove
out
more
,
dressed
better
,
and
attended
*NL*
theatres
freely
to
make
up
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
an
atmosphere
could
hardly
come
under
the
category
of
home
life
.
It
*NL*
ran
along
by
force
of
habit
,
by
force
of
conventional
opinion
.
With
*NL*
the
lapse
of
time
it
must
necessarily
become
dryer
and
dryer
--
must
*NL*
eventually
be
tinder
,
easily
lighted
and
destroyed
.

THE
COUNSEL
OF
WINTER
--
FORTUNE
'S
AMBASSADOR
CALLS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
light
of
the
world
's
attitude
toward
woman
and
her
duties
,
the
*NL*
nature
of
Carrie
's
mental
state
deserves
consideration
.
Actions
such
*NL*
as
hers
are
measured
by
an
arbitrary
scale
.
Society
possesses
a
*NL*
conventional
standard
whereby
it
judges
all
things
.
All
men
should
be
*NL*
good
,
all
women
virtuous
.
Wherefore
,
villain
,
hast
thou
failed
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
the
liberal
analysis
of
Spencer
and
our
modern
naturalistic
*NL*
philosophers
,
we
have
but
an
infantile
perception
of
morals
.
There
is
*NL*
more
in
the
subject
than
mere
conformity
to
a
law
of
evolution
.
It
is
*NL*
yet
deeper
than
conformity
to
things
of
earth
alone
.
It
is
more
involved
*NL*
than
we
,
as
yet
,
perceive
.
Answer
,
first
,
why
the
heart
thrills
;
explain
*NL*
wherefore
some
plaintive
note
goes
wandering
about
the
world
,
undying
;
*NL*
make
clear
the
rose
's
subtle
alchemy
evolving
its
ruddy
lamp
in
light
*NL*
and
rain
.
In
the
essence
of
these
facts
lie
the
first
principles
of
*NL*
morals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
thought
Drouet
,
``
how
delicious
is
my
conquest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
thought
Carrie
,
with
mournful
misgivings
,
``
what
is
it
I
have
*NL*
lost
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
this
world-old
proposition
we
stand
,
serious
,
interested
,
*NL*
confused
;
endeavouring
to
evolve
the
true
theory
of
morals
--
the
true
*NL*
answer
to
what
is
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
view
of
a
certain
stratum
of
society
,
Carrie
was
comfortably
*NL*
established
--
in
the
eyes
of
the
starveling
,
beaten
by
every
wind
and
*NL*
gusty
sheet
of
rain
,
she
was
safe
in
a
halcyon
harbour
.
Drouet
had
taken
*NL*
three
rooms
,
furnished
,
in
Ogden
Place
,
facing
Union
Park
,
on
the
West
*NL*
Side
.
That
was
a
little
,
green-carpeted
breathing
spot
,
than
which
,
*NL*
to-day
,
there
is
nothing
more
beautiful
in
Chicago
.
It
afforded
a
vista
*NL*
pleasant
to
contemplate
.
The
best
room
looked
out
upon
the
lawn
of
the
*NL*
park
,
now
sear
and
brown
,
where
a
little
lake
lay
sheltered
.
Over
the
*NL*
bare
limbs
of
the
trees
,
which
now
swayed
in
the
wintry
wind
,
rose
the
*NL*
steeple
of
the
Union
Park
Congregational
Church
,
and
far
off
the
towers
*NL*
of
several
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rooms
were
comfortably
enough
furnished
.
There
was
a
good
Brussels
*NL*
carpet
on
the
floor
,
rich
in
dull
red
and
lemon
shades
,
and
representing
*NL*
large
jardinieres
filled
with
gorgeous
,
impossible
flowers
.
There
was
a
*NL*
large
pier-glass
mirror
between
the
two
windows
.
A
large
,
soft
,
green
,
*NL*
plush-covered
couch
occupied
one
corner
,
and
several
rocking-chairs
*NL*
were
set
about
.
Some
pictures
,
several
rugs
,
a
few
small
pieces
of
*NL*
bric-a-brac
,
and
the
tale
of
contents
is
told
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
bedroom
,
off
the
front
room
,
was
Carrie
's
trunk
,
bought
by
*NL*
Drouet
,
and
in
the
wardrobe
built
into
the
wall
quite
an
array
of
*NL*
clothing
--
more
than
she
had
ever
possessed
before
,
and
of
very
becoming
*NL*
designs
.
There
was
a
third
room
for
possible
use
as
a
kitchen
,
where
*NL*
Drouet
had
Carrie
establish
a
little
portable
gas
stove
for
the
*NL*
preparation
of
small
lunches
,
oysters
,
Welsh
rarebits
,
and
the
like
,
of
*NL*
which
he
was
exceedingly
fond
;
and
,
lastly
,
a
bath
.
The
whole
place
was
*NL*
cosey
,
in
that
it
was
lighted
by
gas
and
heated
by
furnace
registers
,
*NL*
possessing
also
a
small
grate
,
set
with
an
asbestos
back
,
a
method
of
*NL*
cheerful
warming
which
was
then
first
coming
into
use
.
By
her
industry
*NL*
and
natural
love
of
order
,
which
now
developed
,
the
place
maintained
an
*NL*
air
pleasing
in
the
extreme
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
then
,
was
Carrie
,
established
in
a
pleasant
fashion
,
free
of
*NL*
certain
difficulties
which
most
ominously
confronted
her
,
laden
with
*NL*
many
new
ones
which
were
of
a
mental
order
,
and
altogether
so
turned
*NL*
about
in
all
of
her
earthly
relationships
that
she
might
well
have
been
*NL*
a
new
and
different
individual
.
She
looked
into
her
glass
and
saw
a
*NL*
prettier
Carrie
than
she
had
seen
before
;
she
looked
into
her
mind
,
a
*NL*
mirror
prepared
of
her
own
and
the
world
's
opinions
,
and
saw
a
worse
.
*NL*
Between
these
two
images
she
wavered
,
hesitating
which
to
believe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
,
but
you
're
a
little
beauty
,
''
Drouet
was
wont
to
exclaim
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
look
at
him
with
large
,
pleased
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
it
,
do
n't
you
?
''
he
would
continue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
would
reply
,
feeling
delight
in
the
fact
that
*NL*
one
should
think
so
,
hesitating
to
believe
,
though
she
really
did
,
that
*NL*
she
was
vain
enough
to
think
so
much
of
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
conscience
,
however
,
was
not
a
Drouet
,
interested
to
praise
.
There
*NL*
she
heard
a
different
voice
,
with
which
she
argued
,
pleaded
,
excused
.
It
*NL*
was
no
just
and
sapient
counsellor
,
in
its
last
analysis
.
It
was
only
an
*NL*
average
little
conscience
,
a
thing
which
represented
the
world
,
her
past
*NL*
environment
,
habit
,
convention
,
in
a
confused
way
.
With
it
,
the
voice
of
*NL*
the
people
was
truly
the
voice
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thou
failure
!
''
said
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
she
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
those
about
,
''
came
the
whispered
answer
.
``
Look
at
those
who
are
*NL*
good
.
How
would
they
scorn
to
do
what
you
have
done
.
Look
at
the
good
*NL*
girls
;
how
will
they
draw
away
from
such
as
you
when
they
know
you
have
*NL*
been
weak
.
You
had
not
tried
before
you
failed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
when
Carrie
was
alone
,
looking
out
across
the
park
,
that
she
*NL*
would
be
listening
to
this
.
It
would
come
infrequently
--
when
something
*NL*
else
did
not
interfere
,
when
the
pleasant
side
was
not
too
apparent
,
*NL*
when
Drouet
was
not
there
.
It
was
somewhat
clear
in
utterance
at
first
,
*NL*
but
never
wholly
convincing
.
There
was
always
an
answer
,
always
the
*NL*
December
days
threatened
.
She
was
alone
;
she
was
desireful
;
she
was
*NL*
fearful
of
the
whistling
wind
.
The
voice
of
want
made
answer
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
the
bright
days
of
summer
pass
by
,
a
city
takes
on
that
sombre
*NL*
garb
of
grey
,
wrapt
in
which
it
goes
about
its
labours
during
the
long
*NL*
winter
.
Its
endless
buildings
look
grey
,
its
sky
and
its
streets
assume
*NL*
a
sombre
hue
;
the
scattered
,
leafless
trees
and
wind-blown
dust
and
*NL*
paper
but
add
to
the
general
solemnity
of
colour
.
There
seems
to
be
*NL*
something
in
the
chill
breezes
which
scurry
through
the
long
,
narrow
*NL*
thoroughfares
productive
of
rueful
thoughts
.
Not
poets
alone
,
nor
*NL*
artists
,
nor
that
superior
order
of
mind
which
arrogates
to
itself
all
*NL*
refinement
,
feel
this
,
but
dogs
and
all
men
.
These
feel
as
much
as
the
*NL*
poet
,
though
they
have
not
the
same
power
of
expression
.
The
sparrow
*NL*
upon
the
wire
,
the
cat
in
the
doorway
,
the
dray
horse
tugging
his
weary
*NL*
load
,
feel
the
long
,
keen
breaths
of
winter
.
It
strikes
to
the
heart
of
*NL*
all
life
,
animate
and
inanimate
.
If
it
were
not
for
the
artificial
fires
*NL*
of
merriment
,
the
rush
of
profit-seeking
trade
,
and
pleasure-selling
*NL*
amusements
;
if
the
various
merchants
failed
to
make
the
customary
*NL*
display
within
and
without
their
establishments
;
if
our
streets
were
*NL*
not
strung
with
signs
of
gorgeous
hues
and
thronged
with
hurrying
*NL*
purchasers
,
we
would
quickly
discover
how
firmly
the
chill
hand
of
*NL*
winter
lays
upon
the
heart
;
how
dispiriting
are
the
days
during
which
*NL*
the
sun
withholds
a
portion
of
our
allowance
of
light
and
warmth
.
We
are
*NL*
more
dependent
upon
these
things
than
is
often
thought
.
We
are
insects
*NL*
produced
by
heat
,
and
pass
without
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
drag
of
such
a
grey
day
the
secret
voice
would
reassert
itself
,
*NL*
feebly
and
more
feebly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
mental
conflict
was
not
always
uppermost
.
Carrie
was
not
by
any
*NL*
means
a
gloomy
soul
.
More
,
she
had
not
the
mind
to
get
firm
hold
upon
a
*NL*
definite
truth
.
When
she
could
not
find
her
way
out
of
the
labyrinth
of
*NL*
ill-logic
which
thought
upon
the
subject
created
,
she
would
turn
away
*NL*
entirely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
,
all
the
time
,
was
conducting
himself
in
a
model
way
for
one
of
*NL*
his
sort
.
He
took
her
about
a
great
deal
,
spent
money
upon
her
,
and
when
*NL*
he
travelled
took
her
with
him
.
There
were
times
when
she
would
be
*NL*
alone
for
two
or
three
days
,
while
he
made
the
shorter
circuits
of
his
*NL*
business
,
but
,
as
a
rule
,
she
saw
a
great
deal
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Carrie
,
''
he
said
one
morning
,
shortly
after
they
had
so
*NL*
established
themselves
,
``
I
've
invited
my
friend
Hurstwood
to
come
out
*NL*
some
day
and
spend
the
evening
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
''
asked
Carrie
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
a
nice
man
.
He
's
manager
of
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
finest
resort
in
town
.
It
's
a
way-up
,
swell
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
puzzled
a
moment
.
She
was
wondering
what
Drouet
had
told
him
,
*NL*
what
her
attitude
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
said
Drouet
,
feeling
her
thought
.
``
He
does
n't
know
*NL*
anything
.
You
're
Mrs.
Drouet
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
about
this
which
struck
Carrie
as
slightly
*NL*
inconsiderate
.
She
could
see
that
Drouet
did
not
have
the
keenest
*NL*
sensibilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
we
get
married
?
''
she
inquired
,
thinking
of
the
voluble
*NL*
promises
he
had
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
will
,
''
he
said
,
``
just
as
soon
as
I
get
this
little
deal
of
*NL*
mine
closed
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
referring
to
some
property
which
he
said
he
had
,
and
which
*NL*
required
so
much
attention
,
adjustment
,
and
what
not
,
that
somehow
or
*NL*
other
it
interfered
with
his
free
moral
,
personal
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
soon
as
I
get
back
from
my
Denver
trip
in
January
we
'll
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
accepted
this
as
basis
for
hope
--
it
was
a
sort
of
salve
to
her
*NL*
conscience
,
a
pleasant
way
out
.
Under
the
circumstances
,
things
would
be
*NL*
righted
.
Her
actions
would
be
justified
.
She
really
was
not
enamoured
of
*NL*
Drouet
.
She
was
more
clever
than
he
.
In
a
dim
way
,
she
was
beginning
to
*NL*
see
where
he
lacked
.
If
it
had
not
been
for
this
,
if
she
had
not
been
*NL*
able
to
measure
and
judge
him
in
a
way
,
she
would
have
been
worse
off
*NL*
than
she
was
.
She
would
have
adored
him
.
She
would
have
been
utterly
*NL*
wretched
in
her
fear
of
not
gaining
his
affection
,
of
losing
his
*NL*
interest
,
of
being
swept
away
and
left
without
an
anchorage
.
As
it
*NL*
was
,
she
wavered
a
little
,
slightly
anxious
,
at
first
,
to
gain
him
*NL*
completely
,
but
later
feeling
at
ease
in
waiting
.
She
was
not
exactly
*NL*
sure
what
she
thought
of
him
--
what
she
wanted
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Hurstwood
called
,
she
met
a
man
who
was
more
clever
than
Drouet
*NL*
in
a
hundred
ways
.
He
paid
that
peculiar
deference
to
women
which
every
*NL*
member
of
the
sex
appreciates
.
He
was
not
overawed
,
he
was
not
overbold
.
*NL*
His
great
charm
was
attentiveness
.
Schooled
in
winning
those
birds
of
*NL*
fine
feather
among
his
own
sex
,
the
merchants
and
professionals
who
*NL*
visited
his
resort
,
he
could
use
even
greater
tact
when
endeavouring
to
*NL*
prove
agreeable
to
some
one
who
charmed
him
.
In
a
pretty
woman
of
any
*NL*
refinement
of
feeling
whatsoever
he
found
his
greatest
incentive
.
He
*NL*
was
mild
,
placid
,
assured
,
giving
the
impression
that
he
wished
to
be
of
*NL*
service
only
--
to
do
something
which
would
make
the
lady
more
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
had
ability
in
this
line
himself
when
the
game
was
worth
the
*NL*
candle
,
but
he
was
too
much
the
egotist
to
reach
the
polish
which
*NL*
Hurstwood
possessed
.
He
was
too
buoyant
,
too
full
of
ruddy
life
,
too
*NL*
assured
.
He
succeeded
with
many
who
were
not
quite
schooled
in
the
art
*NL*
of
love
.
He
failed
dismally
where
the
woman
was
slightly
experienced
and
*NL*
possessed
innate
refinement
.
In
the
case
of
Carrie
he
found
a
woman
who
*NL*
was
all
of
the
latter
,
but
none
of
the
former
.
He
was
lucky
in
the
fact
*NL*
that
opportunity
tumbled
into
his
lap
,
as
it
were
.
A
few
years
later
,
*NL*
with
a
little
more
experience
,
the
slightest
tide
of
success
,
and
he
had
*NL*
not
been
able
to
approach
Carrie
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
a
piano
here
,
Drouet
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
smiling
at
*NL*
Carrie
,
on
the
evening
in
question
,
``
so
that
your
wife
could
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
had
not
thought
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
we
ought
,
''
he
observed
readily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
play
,
''
ventured
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
very
difficult
,
''
returned
Hurstwood
.
``
You
could
do
very
well
*NL*
in
a
few
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
the
best
form
for
entertaining
this
evening
.
His
clothes
were
*NL*
particularly
new
and
rich
in
appearance
.
The
coat
lapels
stood
out
with
*NL*
that
medium
stiffness
which
excellent
cloth
possesses
.
The
vest
was
of
*NL*
a
rich
Scotch
plaid
,
set
with
a
double
row
of
round
mother-of-pearl
*NL*
buttons
.
His
cravat
was
a
shiny
combination
of
silken
threads
,
not
loud
,
*NL*
not
inconspicuous
.
What
he
wore
did
not
strike
the
eye
so
forcibly
*NL*
as
that
which
Drouet
had
on
,
but
Carrie
could
see
the
elegance
of
the
*NL*
material
.
Hurstwood
's
shoes
were
of
soft
,
black
calf
,
polished
only
to
a
*NL*
dull
shine
.
Drouet
wore
patent
leather
but
Carrie
could
not
help
feeling
*NL*
that
there
was
a
distinction
in
favour
of
the
soft
leather
,
where
all
*NL*
else
was
so
rich
.
She
noticed
these
things
almost
unconsciously
.
They
*NL*
were
things
which
would
naturally
flow
from
the
situation
.
She
was
used
*NL*
to
Drouet
's
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
we
have
a
little
game
of
euchre
?
''
suggested
Hurstwood
,
after
*NL*
a
light
round
of
conversation
.
He
was
rather
dexterous
in
avoiding
*NL*
everything
that
would
suggest
that
he
knew
anything
of
Carrie
's
past
.
He
*NL*
kept
away
from
personalities
altogether
,
and
confined
himself
to
those
*NL*
things
which
did
not
concern
individuals
at
all
.
By
his
manner
,
he
put
*NL*
Carrie
at
her
ease
,
and
by
his
deference
and
pleasantries
he
amused
her
.
*NL*
He
pretended
to
be
seriously
interested
in
all
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
to
play
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charlie
,
you
are
neglecting
a
part
of
your
duty
,
''
he
observed
to
Drouet
*NL*
most
affably
.
``
Between
us
,
though
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
we
can
show
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
his
tact
he
made
Drouet
feel
that
he
admired
his
choice
.
There
was
*NL*
something
in
his
manner
that
showed
that
he
was
pleased
to
be
there
.
*NL*
Drouet
felt
really
closer
to
him
than
ever
before
.
It
gave
him
more
*NL*
respect
for
Carrie
.
Her
appearance
came
into
a
new
light
,
under
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
appreciation
.
The
situation
livened
considerably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
let
me
see
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
looking
over
Carrie
's
shoulder
very
*NL*
deferentially
.
``
What
have
you
?
''
He
studied
for
a
moment
.
``
That
's
rather
*NL*
good
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
lucky
.
Now
,
I
'll
show
you
how
to
trounce
your
husband
.
You
take
*NL*
my
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
Drouet
,
``
if
you
two
are
going
to
scheme
together
,
I
wo
n't
*NL*
stand
a
ghost
of
a
show
.
Hurstwood
's
a
regular
sharp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
your
wife
.
She
brings
me
luck
.
Why
should
n't
she
win
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
gratefully
at
Hurstwood
,
and
smiled
at
Drouet
.
The
former
*NL*
took
the
air
of
a
mere
friend
.
He
was
simply
there
to
enjoy
himself
.
*NL*
Anything
that
Carrie
did
was
pleasing
to
him
,
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
he
said
,
holding
back
one
of
his
own
good
cards
,
and
giving
*NL*
Carrie
a
chance
to
take
a
trick
.
``
I
count
that
clever
playing
for
a
*NL*
beginner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
laughed
gleefully
as
she
saw
the
hand
coming
her
way
.
It
was
*NL*
as
if
she
were
invincible
when
Hurstwood
helped
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
look
at
her
often
.
When
he
did
,
it
was
with
a
mild
light
in
*NL*
his
eye
.
Not
a
shade
was
there
of
anything
save
geniality
and
kindness
.
*NL*
He
took
back
the
shifty
,
clever
gleam
,
and
replaced
it
with
one
of
*NL*
innocence
.
Carrie
could
not
guess
but
that
it
was
pleasure
with
him
in
*NL*
the
immediate
thing
.
She
felt
that
he
considered
she
was
doing
a
great
*NL*
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
unfair
to
let
such
playing
go
without
earning
something
,
''
he
said
*NL*
after
a
time
,
slipping
his
finger
into
the
little
coin
pocket
of
his
*NL*
coat
.
``
Let
's
play
for
dimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Drouet
,
fishing
for
bills
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
quicker
.
His
fingers
were
full
of
new
ten-cent
pieces
.
*NL*
``
Here
we
are
,
''
he
said
,
supplying
each
one
with
a
little
stack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
this
is
gambling
,
''
smiled
Carrie
.
``
It
's
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Drouet
,
``
only
fun
.
If
you
never
play
for
more
than
that
,
you
*NL*
will
go
to
Heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
moralise
,
''
said
Hurstwood
to
Carrie
gently
,
``
until
you
see
*NL*
what
becomes
of
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
husband
gets
them
,
he
'll
tell
you
how
bad
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
laughed
loud
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
such
an
ingratiating
tone
about
Hurstwood
's
voice
,
the
*NL*
insinuation
was
so
perceptible
that
even
Carrie
got
the
humour
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
you
leave
?
''
said
Hurstwood
to
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
Wednesday
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
rather
hard
to
have
your
husband
running
about
like
that
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
?
''
said
Hurstwood
,
addressing
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
going
along
with
me
this
time
,
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
both
go
with
me
to
the
theatre
before
you
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
Eh
,
Carrie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
it
ever
so
much
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
did
his
best
to
see
that
Carrie
won
the
money
.
He
rejoiced
in
*NL*
her
success
,
kept
counting
her
winnings
,
and
finally
gathered
and
put
*NL*
them
in
her
extended
hand
.
They
spread
a
little
lunch
,
at
which
he
*NL*
served
the
wine
,
and
afterwards
he
used
fine
tact
in
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
first
Carrie
and
then
Drouet
with
his
eyes
,
*NL*
``
you
must
be
ready
at
7.30
.
I
'll
come
and
get
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
with
him
to
the
door
and
there
was
his
cab
waiting
,
its
red
*NL*
lamps
gleaming
cheerfully
in
the
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
he
observed
to
Drouet
,
with
a
tone
of
good-fellowship
,
``
when
you
*NL*
leave
your
wife
alone
,
you
must
let
me
show
her
around
a
little
.
It
will
*NL*
break
up
her
loneliness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
said
Drouet
,
quite
pleased
at
the
attention
shown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
so
kind
,
''
observed
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
``
I
would
want
your
husband
to
do
as
much
*NL*
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
and
went
lightly
away
.
Carrie
was
thoroughly
impressed
.
She
*NL*
had
never
come
in
contact
with
such
grace
.
As
for
Drouet
,
he
was
equally
*NL*
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
nice
man
,
''
he
remarked
to
Carrie
,
as
they
returned
to
their
*NL*
cosey
chamber
.
``
A
good
friend
of
mine
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
seems
to
be

Carrie

Chapter

THE
PERSUASION
OF
FASHION
--
FEELING
GUARDS
O'ER
ITS
OWN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
an
apt
student
of
fortune
's
ways
--
of
fortune
's
*NL*
superficialities
.
Seeing
a
thing
,
she
would
immediately
set
to
inquiring
*NL*
how
she
would
look
,
properly
related
to
it
.
Be
it
known
that
this
is
not
*NL*
fine
feeling
,
it
is
not
wisdom
.
The
greatest
minds
are
not
so
afflicted
;
*NL*
and
on
the
contrary
,
the
lowest
order
of
mind
is
not
so
disturbed
.
*NL*
Fine
clothes
to
her
were
a
vast
persuasion
;
they
spoke
tenderly
and
*NL*
Jesuitically
for
themselves
.
When
she
came
within
earshot
of
their
*NL*
pleading
,
desire
in
her
bent
a
willing
ear
.
The
voice
of
the
so-called
*NL*
inanimate
!
Who
shall
translate
for
us
the
language
of
the
stones
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
the
lace
collar
she
secured
from
Partridge
's
,
``
I
fit
you
*NL*
beautifully
;
do
n't
give
me
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
such
little
feet
,
''
said
the
leather
of
the
soft
new
shoes
;
``
how
*NL*
effectively
I
cover
them
.
What
a
pity
they
should
ever
want
my
aid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
these
things
were
in
her
hand
,
on
her
person
,
she
might
dream
of
*NL*
giving
them
up
;
the
method
by
which
they
came
might
intrude
itself
so
*NL*
forcibly
that
she
would
ache
to
be
rid
of
the
thought
of
it
,
but
she
*NL*
would
not
give
them
up
.
``
Put
on
the
old
clothes
--
that
torn
pair
of
*NL*
shoes
,
''
was
called
to
her
by
her
conscience
in
vain
.
She
could
possibly
*NL*
have
conquered
the
fear
of
hunger
and
gone
back
;
the
thought
of
hard
*NL*
work
and
a
narrow
round
of
suffering
would
,
under
the
last
pressure
of
*NL*
conscience
,
have
yielded
,
but
spoil
her
appearance
?
--
be
old-clothed
and
*NL*
poor-appearing
?
--
never
!
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
heightened
her
opinion
on
this
and
allied
subjects
in
such
a
*NL*
manner
as
to
weaken
her
power
of
resisting
their
influence
.
It
is
so
*NL*
easy
to
do
this
when
the
thing
opined
is
in
the
line
of
what
we
desire
.
*NL*
In
his
hearty
way
,
he
insisted
upon
her
good
looks
.
He
looked
at
her
*NL*
admiringly
,
and
she
took
it
at
its
full
value
.
Under
the
circumstances
,
*NL*
she
did
not
need
to
carry
herself
as
pretty
women
do
.
She
picked
that
*NL*
knowledge
up
fast
enough
for
herself
.
Drouet
had
a
habit
,
characteristic
*NL*
of
his
kind
,
of
looking
after
stylishly
dressed
or
pretty
women
on
the
*NL*
street
and
remarking
upon
them
.
He
had
just
enough
of
the
feminine
love
*NL*
of
dress
to
be
a
good
judge
--
not
of
intellect
,
but
of
clothes
.
He
saw
*NL*
how
they
set
their
little
feet
,
how
they
carried
their
chins
,
with
what
*NL*
grace
and
sinuosity
they
swung
their
bodies
.
A
dainty
,
self-conscious
*NL*
swaying
of
the
hips
by
a
woman
was
to
him
as
alluring
as
the
glint
of
*NL*
rare
wine
to
a
toper
.
He
would
turn
and
follow
the
disappearing
vision
*NL*
with
his
eyes
.
He
would
thrill
as
a
child
with
the
unhindered
passion
*NL*
that
was
in
him
.
He
loved
the
thing
that
women
love
in
themselves
,
*NL*
grace
.
At
this
,
their
own
shrine
,
he
knelt
with
them
,
an
ardent
devotee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
that
woman
who
went
by
just
now
?
''
he
said
to
Carrie
on
the
*NL*
first
day
they
took
a
walk
together
.
``
Fine
stepper
,
was
n't
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
,
and
observed
the
grace
commended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
is
,
''
she
returned
,
cheerfully
,
a
little
suggestion
of
possible
*NL*
defect
in
herself
awakening
in
her
mind
.
If
that
was
so
fine
,
she
must
*NL*
look
at
it
more
closely
.
Instinctively
,
she
felt
a
desire
to
imitate
it
.
*NL*
Surely
she
could
do
that
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
one
of
her
mind
sees
many
things
emphasized
and
re-emphasized
and
*NL*
admired
,
she
gathers
the
logic
of
it
and
applies
accordingly
.
Drouet
*NL*
was
not
shrewd
enough
to
see
that
this
was
not
tactful
.
He
could
not
*NL*
see
that
it
would
be
better
to
make
her
feel
that
she
was
competing
with
*NL*
herself
,
not
others
better
than
herself
.
He
would
not
have
done
it
with
*NL*
an
older
,
wiser
woman
,
but
in
Carrie
he
saw
only
the
novice
.
Less
clever
*NL*
than
she
,
he
was
naturally
unable
to
comprehend
her
sensibility
.
He
*NL*
went
on
educating
and
wounding
her
,
a
thing
rather
foolish
in
one
whose
*NL*
admiration
for
his
pupil
and
victim
was
apt
to
grow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
took
the
instructions
affably
.
She
saw
what
Drouet
liked
;
in
a
*NL*
vague
way
she
saw
where
he
was
weak
.
It
lessens
a
woman
's
opinion
of
a
*NL*
man
when
she
learns
that
his
admiration
is
so
pointedly
and
generously
*NL*
distributed
.
She
sees
but
one
object
of
supreme
compliment
in
this
*NL*
world
,
and
that
is
herself
.
If
a
man
is
to
succeed
with
many
women
,
he
*NL*
must
be
all
in
all
to
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
own
apartments
Carrie
saw
things
which
were
lessons
in
the
same
*NL*
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
house
with
her
lived
an
official
of
one
of
the
theatres
,
Mr.
*NL*
Frank
A.
Hale
,
manager
of
the
Standard
,
and
his
wife
,
a
pleasing-looking
*NL*
brunette
of
thirty-five
.
They
were
people
of
a
sort
very
common
in
*NL*
America
today
,
who
live
respectably
from
hand
to
mouth
.
Hale
received
*NL*
a
salary
of
forty-five
dollars
a
week
.
His
wife
,
quite
attractive
,
*NL*
affected
the
feeling
of
youth
,
and
objected
to
that
sort
of
home
life
*NL*
which
means
the
care
of
a
house
and
the
raising
of
a
family
.
Like
Drouet
*NL*
and
Carrie
,
they
also
occupied
three
rooms
on
the
floor
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
she
arrived
Mrs.
Hale
established
social
relations
with
*NL*
her
,
and
together
they
went
about
.
For
a
long
time
this
was
her
only
*NL*
companionship
,
and
the
gossip
of
the
manager
's
wife
formed
the
medium
*NL*
through
which
she
saw
the
world
.
Such
trivialities
,
such
praises
of
*NL*
wealth
,
such
conventional
expression
of
morals
as
sifted
through
this
*NL*
passive
creature
's
mind
,
fell
upon
Carrie
and
for
the
while
confused
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
her
own
feelings
were
a
corrective
influence
.
The
*NL*
constant
drag
to
something
better
was
not
to
be
denied
.
By
those
things
*NL*
which
address
the
heart
was
she
steadily
recalled
.
In
the
apartments
*NL*
across
the
hall
were
a
young
girl
and
her
mother
.
They
were
from
*NL*
Evansville
,
Indiana
,
the
wife
and
daughter
of
a
railroad
treasurer
.
The
*NL*
daughter
was
here
to
study
music
,
the
mother
to
keep
her
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
did
not
make
their
acquaintance
,
but
she
saw
the
daughter
coming
*NL*
in
and
going
out
.
A
few
times
she
had
seen
her
at
the
piano
in
the
*NL*
parlour
,
and
not
infrequently
had
heard
her
play
.
This
young
woman
was
*NL*
particularly
dressy
for
her
station
,
and
wore
a
jewelled
ring
or
two
*NL*
which
flashed
upon
her
white
fingers
as
she
played
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Carrie
was
affected
by
music
.
Her
nervous
composition
responded
*NL*
to
certain
strains
,
much
as
certain
strings
of
a
harp
vibrate
when
a
*NL*
corresponding
key
of
a
piano
is
struck
.
She
was
delicately
moulded
*NL*
in
sentiment
,
and
answered
with
vague
ruminations
to
certain
wistful
*NL*
chords
.
They
awoke
longings
for
those
things
which
she
did
not
have
.
*NL*
They
caused
her
to
cling
closer
to
things
she
possessed
.
One
short
song
*NL*
the
young
lady
played
in
a
most
soulful
and
tender
mood
.
Carrie
heard
*NL*
it
through
the
open
door
from
the
parlour
below
.
It
was
at
that
hour
*NL*
between
afternoon
and
night
when
,
for
the
idle
,
the
wanderer
,
things
are
*NL*
apt
to
take
on
a
wistful
aspect
.
The
mind
wanders
forth
on
far
journeys
*NL*
and
returns
with
sheaves
of
withered
and
departed
joys
.
Carrie
sat
at
*NL*
her
window
looking
out
.
Drouet
had
been
away
since
ten
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
She
had
amused
herself
with
a
walk
,
a
book
by
Bertha
M.
Clay
which
*NL*
Drouet
had
left
there
,
though
she
did
not
wholly
enjoy
the
latter
,
and
*NL*
by
changing
her
dress
for
the
evening
.
Now
she
sat
looking
out
across
*NL*
the
park
as
wistful
and
depressed
as
the
nature
which
craves
variety
and
*NL*
life
can
be
under
such
circumstances
.
As
she
contemplated
her
new
state
,
*NL*
the
strain
from
the
parlour
below
stole
upward
.
With
it
her
thoughts
*NL*
became
coloured
and
enmeshed
.
She
reverted
to
the
things
which
were
best
*NL*
and
saddest
within
the
small
limit
of
her
experience
.
She
became
for
the
*NL*
moment
a
repentant
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
in
this
mood
Drouet
came
in
,
bringing
with
him
an
entirely
*NL*
different
atmosphere
.
It
was
dusk
and
Carrie
had
neglected
to
light
the
*NL*
lamp
.
The
fire
in
the
grate
,
too
,
had
burned
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
,
Cad
?
''
he
said
,
using
a
pet
name
he
had
given
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
delicate
and
lonely
in
her
voice
,
but
he
could
not
*NL*
hear
it
.
He
had
not
the
poetry
in
him
that
would
seek
a
woman
out
under
*NL*
such
circumstances
and
console
her
for
the
tragedy
of
life
.
Instead
,
he
*NL*
struck
a
match
and
lighted
the
gas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
you
've
been
crying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
still
wet
with
a
few
vague
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pshaw
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
do
n't
want
to
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
,
feeling
in
his
good-natured
egotism
that
it
was
*NL*
probably
lack
of
his
presence
which
had
made
her
lonely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
now
,
''
he
went
on
;
``
it
's
all
right
.
Let
's
waltz
a
little
to
*NL*
that
music
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
have
introduced
a
more
incongruous
proposition
.
It
made
*NL*
clear
to
Carrie
that
he
could
not
sympathise
with
her
.
She
could
not
*NL*
have
framed
thoughts
which
would
have
expressed
his
defect
or
made
clear
*NL*
the
difference
between
them
,
but
she
felt
it
.
It
was
his
first
great
*NL*
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Drouet
said
about
the
girl
's
grace
,
as
she
tripped
out
evenings
*NL*
accompanied
by
her
mother
,
caused
Carrie
to
perceive
the
nature
and
*NL*
value
of
those
little
modish
ways
which
women
adopt
when
they
would
*NL*
presume
to
be
something
.
She
looked
in
the
mirror
and
pursed
up
her
*NL*
lips
,
accompanying
it
with
a
little
toss
of
the
head
,
as
she
had
seen
*NL*
the
railroad
treasurer
's
daughter
do
.
She
caught
up
her
skirts
with
an
*NL*
easy
swing
,
for
had
not
Drouet
remarked
that
in
her
and
several
others
,
*NL*
and
Carrie
was
naturally
imitative
.
She
began
to
get
the
hang
of
those
*NL*
little
things
which
the
pretty
woman
who
has
vanity
invariably
adopts
.
*NL*
In
short
,
her
knowledge
of
grace
doubled
,
and
with
it
her
appearance
*NL*
changed
.
She
became
a
girl
of
considerable
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
noticed
this
.
He
saw
the
new
bow
in
her
hair
and
the
new
way
of
*NL*
arranging
her
locks
which
she
affected
one
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
fine
that
way
,
Cad
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
?
''
she
replied
,
sweetly
.
It
made
her
try
for
other
effects
that
*NL*
selfsame
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
used
her
feet
less
heavily
,
a
thing
that
was
brought
about
by
her
*NL*
attempting
to
imitate
the
treasurer
's
daughter
's
graceful
carriage
.
How
*NL*
much
influence
the
presence
of
that
young
woman
in
the
same
house
had
*NL*
upon
her
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
.
But
,
because
of
all
these
things
,
*NL*
when
Hurstwood
called
he
had
found
a
young
woman
who
was
much
more
than
*NL*
the
Carrie
to
whom
Drouet
had
first
spoken
.
The
primary
defects
of
dress
*NL*
and
manner
had
passed
.
She
was
pretty
,
graceful
,
rich
in
the
timidity
*NL*
born
of
uncertainty
,
and
with
a
something
childlike
in
her
large
eyes
*NL*
which
captured
the
fancy
of
this
starched
and
conventional
poser
among
*NL*
men
.
It
was
the
ancient
attraction
of
the
fresh
for
the
stale
.
If
*NL*
there
was
a
touch
of
appreciation
left
in
him
for
the
bloom
and
*NL*
unsophistication
which
is
the
charm
of
youth
,
it
rekindled
now
.
He
*NL*
looked
into
her
pretty
face
and
felt
the
subtle
waves
of
young
life
*NL*
radiating
therefrom
.
In
that
large
clear
eye
he
could
see
nothing
that
*NL*
his
blase
nature
could
understand
as
guile
.
The
little
vanity
,
if
he
*NL*
could
have
perceived
it
there
,
would
have
touched
him
as
a
pleasant
*NL*
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
rode
away
in
his
cab
,
``
how
Drouet
came
to
win
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
credit
for
feelings
superior
to
Drouet
at
the
first
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cab
plopped
along
between
the
far-receding
lines
of
gas
lamps
on
*NL*
either
hand
.
He
folded
his
gloved
hands
and
saw
only
the
lighted
chamber
*NL*
and
Carrie
's
face
.
He
was
pondering
over
the
delight
of
youthful
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
a
bouquet
for
her
,
''
he
thought
.
``
Drouet
wo
n't
mind
.
''
He
*NL*
never
for
a
moment
concealed
the
fact
of
her
attraction
for
himself
.
*NL*
He
troubled
himself
not
at
all
about
Drouet
's
priority
.
He
was
merely
*NL*
floating
those
gossamer
threads
of
thought
which
,
like
the
spider
's
,
*NL*
he
hoped
would
lay
hold
somewhere
.
He
did
not
know
,
he
could
not
guess
,
*NL*
what
the
result
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
weeks
later
Drouet
,
in
his
peregrinations
,
encountered
one
of
his
*NL*
well-dressed
lady
acquaintances
in
Chicago
on
his
return
from
a
short
*NL*
trip
to
Omaha
.
He
had
intended
to
hurry
out
to
Ogden
Place
and
surprise
*NL*
Carrie
,
but
now
he
fell
into
an
interesting
conversation
and
soon
*NL*
modified
his
original
intention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
to
dinner
,
''
he
said
,
little
recking
any
chance
meeting
which
*NL*
might
trouble
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
visited
one
of
the
better
restaurants
for
a
social
chat
.
It
was
*NL*
five
in
the
afternoon
when
they
met
;
it
was
seven-thirty
before
the
last
*NL*
bone
was
picked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
was
just
finishing
a
little
incident
he
was
relating
,
and
his
*NL*
face
was
expanding
into
a
smile
,
when
Hurstwood
's
eye
caught
his
own
.
*NL*
The
latter
had
come
in
with
several
friends
,
and
,
seeing
Drouet
and
some
*NL*
woman
,
not
Carrie
,
drew
his
own
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
rascal
,
''
he
thought
,
and
then
,
with
a
touch
of
righteous
*NL*
sympathy
,
``
that
's
pretty
hard
on
the
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
jumped
from
one
easy
thought
to
another
as
he
caught
Hurstwood
's
*NL*
eye
.
He
felt
but
very
little
misgiving
,
until
he
saw
that
Hurstwood
was
*NL*
cautiously
pretending
not
to
see
.
Then
some
of
the
latter
's
impression
*NL*
forced
itself
upon
him
.
He
thought
of
Carrie
and
their
last
meeting
.
*NL*
By
George
,
he
would
have
to
explain
this
to
Hurstwood
.
Such
a
chance
*NL*
half-hour
with
an
old
friend
must
not
have
anything
more
attached
to
it
*NL*
than
it
really
warranted
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
he
was
troubled
.
Here
was
a
moral
complication
of
*NL*
which
he
could
not
possibly
get
the
ends
.
Hurstwood
would
laugh
at
him
*NL*
for
being
a
fickle
boy
.
He
would
laugh
with
Hurstwood
.
Carrie
would
*NL*
never
hear
,
his
present
companion
at
table
would
never
know
,
and
yet
he
*NL*
could
not
help
feeling
that
he
was
getting
the
worst
of
it
--
there
was
*NL*
some
faint
stigma
attached
,
and
he
was
not
guilty
.
He
broke
up
the
*NL*
dinner
by
becoming
dull
,
and
saw
his
companion
on
her
car
.
Then
he
went
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
n't
talked
to
me
about
any
of
these
later
flames
,
''
thought
*NL*
Hurstwood
to
himself
.
``
He
thinks
I
think
he
cares
for
the
girl
out
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ought
not
to
think
I
'm
knocking
around
,
since
I
have
just
introduced
*NL*
him
out
there
,
''
thought
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
,
''
Hurstwood
said
,
genially
,
the
next
time
Drouet
drifted
in
*NL*
to
his
polished
resort
,
from
which
he
could
not
stay
away
.
He
raised
his
*NL*
forefinger
indicatively
,
as
parents
do
to
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
acquaintance
of
mine
that
I
ran
into
just
as
I
was
coming
up
*NL*
from
the
station
,
''
explained
Drouet
.
``
She
used
to
be
quite
a
beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
attracts
a
little
,
eh
?
''
returned
the
other
,
affecting
to
jest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Drouet
,
``
just
could
n't
escape
her
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
are
you
here
?
''
asked
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
bring
the
girl
down
and
take
dinner
with
me
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
you
keep
her
cooped
up
out
there
.
I
'll
get
a
box
for
Joe
*NL*
Jefferson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
me
,
''
answered
the
drummer
.
``
Sure
I
'll
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
pleased
Hurstwood
immensely
.
He
gave
Drouet
no
credit
for
any
*NL*
feelings
toward
Carrie
whatever
.
He
envied
him
,
and
now
,
as
he
looked
at
*NL*
the
well-dressed
jolly
salesman
,
whom
he
so
much
liked
,
the
gleam
of
*NL*
the
rival
glowed
in
his
eye
.
He
began
to
``
size
up
''
Drouet
from
the
*NL*
standpoints
of
wit
and
fascination
.
He
began
to
look
to
see
where
he
was
*NL*
weak
.
There
was
no
disputing
that
,
whatever
he
might
think
of
him
as
a
*NL*
good
fellow
,
he
felt
a
certain
amount
of
contempt
for
him
as
a
lover
.
He
*NL*
could
hoodwink
him
all
right
.
Why
,
if
he
would
just
let
Carrie
see
one
*NL*
such
little
incident
as
that
of
Thursday
,
it
would
settle
the
matter
.
*NL*
He
ran
on
in
thought
,
almost
exulting
,
the
while
he
laughed
and
chatted
,
*NL*
and
Drouet
felt
nothing
.
He
had
no
power
of
analysing
the
glance
and
the
*NL*
atmosphere
of
a
man
like
Hurstwood
.
He
stood
and
smiled
and
accepted
the
*NL*
invitation
while
his
friend
examined
him
with
the
eye
of
a
hawk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
object
of
this
peculiarly
involved
comedy
was
not
thinking
of
*NL*
either
.
She
was
busy
adjusting
her
thoughts
and
feelings
to
newer
*NL*
conditions
,
and
was
not
in
danger
of
suffering
disturbing
pangs
from
*NL*
either
quarter
.
One
evening
Drouet
found
her
dressing
herself
before
the
*NL*
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cad
,
''
said
he
,
catching
her
,
``
I
believe
you
're
getting
vain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
of
the
kind
,
''
she
returned
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
mighty
pretty
,
''
he
went
on
,
slipping
his
arm
around
her
.
*NL*
``
Put
on
that
navy-blue
dress
of
yours
and
I
'll
take
you
to
the
show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
promised
Mrs.
Hale
to
go
with
her
to
the
Exposition
to-night
,
''
*NL*
she
returned
,
apologetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
,
eh
?
''
he
said
,
studying
the
situation
abstractedly
.
``
I
would
n't
*NL*
care
to
go
to
that
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
answered
Carrie
,
puzzling
,
but
not
offering
to
*NL*
break
her
promise
in
his
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
a
knock
came
at
their
door
and
the
maidservant
handed
a
letter
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
there
's
an
answer
expected
,
''
she
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
from
Hurstwood
,
''
said
Drouet
,
noting
the
superscription
as
he
tore
*NL*
it
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
to
come
down
and
see
Joe
Jefferson
with
me
to-night
,
''
it
ran
*NL*
in
part
.
``
It
's
my
turn
,
as
we
agreed
the
other
day
.
All
other
bets
are
*NL*
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
say
to
this
?
''
asked
Drouet
,
innocently
,
while
*NL*
Carrie
's
mind
bubbled
with
favourable
replies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
decide
,
Charlie
,
''
she
said
,
reservedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
we
had
better
go
,
if
you
can
break
that
engagement
upstairs
,
''
*NL*
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
,
''
returned
Carrie
without
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
selected
writing
paper
while
Carrie
went
to
change
her
dress
.
She
*NL*
hardly
explained
to
herself
why
this
latest
invitation
appealed
to
her
*NL*
most
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
wear
my
hair
as
I
did
yesterday
?
''
she
asked
,
as
she
came
out
*NL*
with
several
articles
of
apparel
pending
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
he
returned
,
pleasantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
relieved
to
see
that
he
felt
nothing
.
She
did
not
credit
her
*NL*
willingness
to
go
to
any
fascination
Hurstwood
held
for
her
.
It
*NL*
seemed
that
the
combination
of
Hurstwood
,
Drouet
,
and
herself
was
*NL*
more
agreeable
than
anything
else
that
had
been
suggested
.
She
arrayed
*NL*
herself
most
carefully
and
they
started
off
,
extending
excuses
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
as
they
came
up
the
theatre
lobby
,
``
we
are
*NL*
exceedingly
charming
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
fluttered
under
his
approving
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
''
he
said
,
leading
the
way
up
the
foyer
into
the
theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
ever
there
was
dressiness
it
was
here
.
It
was
the
personification
of
*NL*
the
old
term
spick
and
span
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
see
Jefferson
?
''
he
questioned
,
as
he
leaned
toward
Carrie
*NL*
in
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
did
,
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
delightful
,
delightful
,
''
he
went
on
,
giving
the
commonplace
*NL*
rendition
of
approval
which
such
men
know
.
He
sent
Drouet
after
a
*NL*
programme
,
and
then
discoursed
to
Carrie
concerning
Jefferson
as
he
had
*NL*
heard
of
him
.
The
former
was
pleased
beyond
expression
,
and
was
really
*NL*
hypnotised
by
the
environment
,
the
trappings
of
the
box
,
the
elegance
of
*NL*
her
companion
.
Several
times
their
eyes
accidentally
met
,
and
then
*NL*
there
poured
into
hers
such
a
flood
of
feeling
as
she
had
never
before
*NL*
experienced
.
She
could
not
for
the
moment
explain
it
,
for
in
the
next
*NL*
glance
or
the
next
move
of
the
hand
there
was
seeming
indifference
,
*NL*
mingled
only
with
the
kindest
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
shared
in
the
conversation
,
but
he
was
almost
dull
in
comparison
.
*NL*
Hurstwood
entertained
them
both
,
and
now
it
was
driven
into
Carrie
's
*NL*
mind
that
here
was
the
superior
man
.
She
instinctively
felt
that
he
was
*NL*
stronger
and
higher
,
and
yet
withal
so
simple
.
By
the
end
of
the
third
*NL*
act
she
was
sure
that
Drouet
was
only
a
kindly
soul
,
but
otherwise
*NL*
defective
.
He
sank
every
moment
in
her
estimation
by
the
strong
*NL*
comparison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
such
a
nice
time
,
''
said
Carrie
,
when
it
was
all
over
and
*NL*
they
were
coming
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
''
added
Drouet
,
who
was
not
in
the
least
aware
that
a
*NL*
battle
had
been
fought
and
his
defences
weakened
.
He
was
like
the
*NL*
Emperor
of
China
,
who
sat
glorying
in
himself
,
unaware
that
his
fairest
*NL*
provinces
were
being
wrested
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
have
saved
me
a
dreary
evening
,
''
returned
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
``
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
Carrie
's
little
hand
,
and
a
current
of
feeling
swept
from
one
to
*NL*
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
tired
,
''
said
Carrie
,
leaning
back
in
the
car
when
Drouet
began
*NL*
to
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
rest
a
little
while
I
smoke
,
''
he
said
,
rising
,
and
then
he
*NL*
foolishly
went
to
the
forward
platform
of
the
car
and
left
the
game
as
*NL*
it
stood
.

Chapter
XII
.
OF
THE
LAMPS
OF
THE
MANSIONS
--
THE
AMBASSADOR
PLEA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurstwood
was
not
aware
of
any
of
her
husband
's
moral
defections
,
*NL*
though
she
might
readily
have
suspected
his
tendencies
,
which
she
well
*NL*
understood
.
She
was
a
woman
upon
whose
action
under
provocation
you
*NL*
could
never
count
.
Hurstwood
,
for
one
,
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
*NL*
what
she
would
do
under
certain
circumstances
.
He
had
never
seen
her
*NL*
thoroughly
aroused
.
In
fact
,
she
was
not
a
woman
who
would
fly
into
a
*NL*
passion
.
She
had
too
little
faith
in
mankind
not
to
know
that
they
were
*NL*
erring
.
She
was
too
calculating
to
jeopardize
any
advantage
she
might
*NL*
gain
in
the
way
of
information
by
fruitless
clamour
.
Her
wrath
would
*NL*
never
wreak
itself
in
one
fell
blow
.
She
would
wait
and
brood
,
studying
*NL*
the
details
and
adding
to
them
until
her
power
might
be
commensurate
*NL*
with
her
desire
for
revenge
.
At
the
same
time
,
she
would
not
delay
to
*NL*
inflict
any
injury
,
big
or
little
,
which
would
wound
the
object
of
her
*NL*
revenge
and
still
leave
him
uncertain
as
to
the
source
of
the
evil
.
She
*NL*
was
a
cold
,
self-centred
woman
,
with
many
a
thought
of
her
own
which
*NL*
never
found
expression
,
not
even
by
so
much
as
the
glint
of
an
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
felt
some
of
this
in
her
nature
,
though
he
did
not
actually
*NL*
perceive
it
.
He
dwelt
with
her
in
peace
and
some
satisfaction
.
He
did
*NL*
not
fear
her
in
the
least
--
there
was
no
cause
for
it
.
She
still
took
a
*NL*
faint
pride
in
him
,
which
was
augmented
by
her
desire
to
have
her
social
*NL*
integrity
maintained
.
She
was
secretly
somewhat
pleased
by
the
fact
*NL*
that
much
of
her
husband
's
property
was
in
her
name
,
a
precaution
which
*NL*
Hurstwood
had
taken
when
his
home
interests
were
somewhat
more
alluring
*NL*
than
at
present
.
His
wife
had
not
the
slightest
reason
to
feel
that
*NL*
anything
would
ever
go
amiss
with
their
household
,
and
yet
the
shadows
*NL*
which
run
before
gave
her
a
thought
of
the
good
of
it
now
and
then
.
She
*NL*
was
in
a
position
to
become
refractory
with
considerable
advantage
,
and
*NL*
Hurstwood
conducted
himself
circumspectly
because
he
felt
that
he
could
*NL*
not
be
sure
of
anything
once
she
became
dissatisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
on
the
night
when
Hurstwood
,
Carrie
,
and
Drouet
*NL*
were
in
the
box
at
McVickar
's
,
George
,
Jr.
,
was
in
the
sixth
row
of
the
*NL*
parquet
with
the
daughter
of
H.
B.
Carmichael
,
the
third
partner
of
a
*NL*
wholesale
dry-goods
house
of
that
city
.
Hurstwood
did
not
see
his
son
,
*NL*
for
he
sat
,
as
was
his
wont
,
as
far
back
as
possible
,
leaving
himself
*NL*
just
partially
visible
,
when
he
bent
forward
,
to
those
within
the
*NL*
first
six
rows
in
question
.
It
was
his
wont
to
sit
this
way
in
every
*NL*
theatre
--
to
make
his
personality
as
inconspicuous
as
possible
where
it
*NL*
would
be
no
advantage
to
him
to
have
it
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
moved
but
what
,
if
there
was
any
danger
of
his
conduct
being
*NL*
misconstrued
or
ill-reported
,
he
looked
carefully
about
him
and
counted
*NL*
the
cost
of
every
inch
of
conspicuity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
at
breakfast
his
son
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
,
Governor
,
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
at
McVickar
's
?
''
said
Hurstwood
,
with
the
best
grace
in
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
young
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Carmichael
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurstwood
directed
an
inquiring
glance
at
her
husband
,
but
could
*NL*
not
judge
from
his
appearance
whether
it
was
any
more
than
a
casual
look
*NL*
into
the
theatre
which
was
referred
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
the
play
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
returned
Hurstwood
,
``
only
it
's
the
same
old
thing
,
`
Rip
Van
*NL*
Winkle
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
did
you
go
with
?
''
queried
his
wife
,
with
assumed
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charlie
Drouet
and
his
wife
.
They
are
friends
of
Moy
's
,
visiting
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
the
peculiar
nature
of
his
position
,
such
a
disclosure
as
this
*NL*
would
ordinarily
create
no
difficulty
.
His
wife
took
it
for
granted
that
*NL*
his
situation
called
for
certain
social
movements
in
which
she
might
not
*NL*
be
included
.
But
of
late
he
had
pleaded
office
duty
on
several
occasions
*NL*
when
his
wife
asked
for
his
company
to
any
evening
entertainment
.
He
*NL*
had
done
so
in
regard
to
the
very
evening
in
question
only
the
morning
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
going
to
be
busy
,
''
she
remarked
,
very
carefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
was
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
I
could
n't
help
the
interruption
,
but
I
made
*NL*
up
for
it
afterward
by
working
until
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
settled
the
discussion
for
the
time
being
,
but
there
was
a
residue
*NL*
of
opinion
which
was
not
satisfactory
.
There
was
no
time
at
which
the
*NL*
claims
of
his
wife
could
have
been
more
unsatisfactorily
pushed
.
For
*NL*
years
he
had
been
steadily
modifying
his
matrimonial
devotion
,
and
found
*NL*
her
company
dull
.
Now
that
a
new
light
shone
upon
the
horizon
,
this
*NL*
older
luminary
paled
in
the
west
.
He
was
satisfied
to
turn
his
face
away
*NL*
entirely
,
and
any
call
to
look
back
was
irksome
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
on
the
contrary
,
was
not
at
all
inclined
to
accept
anything
less
*NL*
than
a
complete
fulfilment
of
the
letter
of
their
relationship
,
though
*NL*
the
spirit
might
be
wanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
coming
down
town
this
afternoon
,
''
she
remarked
,
a
few
days
*NL*
later
.
``
I
want
you
to
come
over
to
Kinsley
's
and
meet
Mr.
Phillips
and
*NL*
his
wife
.
They
're
stopping
at
the
Tremont
,
and
we
're
going
to
show
them
*NL*
around
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
occurrence
of
Wednesday
,
he
could
not
refuse
,
though
the
*NL*
Phillips
were
about
as
uninteresting
as
vanity
and
ignorance
could
make
*NL*
them
.
He
agreed
,
but
it
was
with
short
grace
.
He
was
angry
when
he
left
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
put
a
stop
to
this
,
''
he
thought
.
``
I
'm
not
going
to
be
bothered
*NL*
fooling
around
with
visitors
when
I
have
work
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
this
Mrs.
Hurstwood
came
with
a
similar
proposition
,
only
*NL*
it
was
to
a
matinee
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
he
returned
,
``
I
have
n't
time
.
I
'm
too
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
find
time
to
go
with
other
people
,
though
,
''
she
replied
,
with
*NL*
considerable
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
of
the
kind
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
ca
n't
avoid
business
relations
,
*NL*
and
that
's
all
there
is
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
never
mind
,
''
she
exclaimed
.
Her
lips
tightened
.
The
feeling
of
*NL*
mutual
antagonism
was
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
his
interest
in
Drouet
's
little
shop-girl
grew
in
an
*NL*
almost
evenly
balanced
proportion
.
That
young
lady
,
under
the
stress
of
*NL*
her
situation
and
the
tutelage
of
her
new
friend
,
changed
effectively
.
*NL*
She
had
the
aptitude
of
the
struggler
who
seeks
emancipation
.
The
*NL*
glow
of
a
more
showy
life
was
not
lost
upon
her
.
She
did
not
grow
in
*NL*
knowledge
so
much
as
she
awakened
in
the
matter
of
desire
.
Mrs.
Hale
's
*NL*
extended
harangues
upon
the
subjects
of
wealth
and
position
taught
her
*NL*
to
distinguish
between
degrees
of
wealth
.
Mrs.
Hale
loved
to
drive
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
in
the
sun
when
it
was
fine
,
and
to
satisfy
her
soul
with
*NL*
a
sight
of
those
mansions
and
lawns
which
she
could
not
afford
.
On
the
*NL*
North
Side
had
been
erected
a
number
of
elegant
mansions
along
what
is
*NL*
now
known
as
the
North
Shore
Drive
.
The
present
lake
wall
of
stone
and
*NL*
granitoid
was
not
then
in
place
,
but
the
road
had
been
well
laid
out
,
*NL*
the
intermediate
spaces
of
lawn
were
lovely
to
look
upon
,
and
the
houses
*NL*
were
thoroughly
new
and
imposing
.
When
the
winter
season
had
passed
and
*NL*
the
first
fine
days
of
the
early
spring
appeared
,
Mrs.
Hale
secured
*NL*
a
buggy
for
an
afternoon
and
invited
Carrie
.
They
rode
first
through
*NL*
Lincoln
Park
and
on
far
out
towards
Evanston
,
turning
back
at
four
and
*NL*
arriving
at
the
north
end
of
the
Shore
Drive
at
about
five
o'clock
.
*NL*
At
this
time
of
year
the
days
are
still
comparatively
short
,
and
the
*NL*
shadows
of
the
evening
were
beginning
to
settle
down
upon
the
great
*NL*
city
.
Lamps
were
beginning
to
burn
with
that
mellow
radiance
which
seems
*NL*
almost
watery
and
translucent
to
the
eye
.
There
was
a
softness
in
the
*NL*
air
which
speaks
with
an
infinite
delicacy
of
feeling
to
the
flesh
*NL*
as
well
as
to
the
soul
.
Carrie
felt
that
it
was
a
lovely
day
.
She
was
*NL*
ripened
by
it
in
spirit
for
many
suggestions
.
As
they
drove
along
the
*NL*
smooth
pavement
an
occasional
carriage
passed
.
She
saw
one
stop
and
*NL*
the
footman
dismount
,
opening
the
door
for
a
gentleman
who
seemed
to
*NL*
be
leisurely
returning
from
some
afternoon
pleasure
.
Across
the
broad
*NL*
lawns
,
now
first
freshening
into
green
,
she
saw
lamps
faintly
glowing
*NL*
upon
rich
interiors
.
Now
it
was
but
a
chair
,
now
a
table
,
now
an
ornate
*NL*
corner
,
which
met
her
eye
,
but
it
appealed
to
her
as
almost
nothing
else
*NL*
could
.
Such
childish
fancies
as
she
had
had
of
fairy
palaces
and
kingly
*NL*
quarters
now
came
back
.
She
imagined
that
across
these
richly
carved
*NL*
entrance-ways
,
where
the
globed
and
crystalled
lamps
shone
upon
panelled
*NL*
doors
set
with
stained
and
designed
panes
of
glass
,
was
neither
care
nor
*NL*
unsatisfied
desire
.
She
was
perfectly
certain
that
here
was
happiness
.
*NL*
If
she
could
but
stroll
up
yon
broad
walk
,
cross
that
rich
entrance-way
,
*NL*
which
to
her
was
of
the
beauty
of
a
jewel
,
and
sweep
in
grace
and
luxury
*NL*
to
possession
and
command
--
oh
!
how
quickly
would
sadness
flee
;
how
,
in
*NL*
an
instant
,
would
the
heartache
end
.
She
gazed
and
gazed
,
wondering
,
*NL*
delighting
,
longing
,
and
all
the
while
the
siren
voice
of
the
unrestful
*NL*
was
whispering
in
her
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
could
have
such
a
home
as
that
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hale
sadly
,
``
how
*NL*
delightful
it
would
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
they
do
say
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
that
no
one
is
ever
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
heard
so
much
of
the
canting
philosophy
of
the
grapeless
fox
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
notice
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hale
,
``
that
they
all
try
mighty
hard
,
though
,
to
*NL*
take
their
misery
in
a
mansion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
came
to
her
own
rooms
,
Carrie
saw
their
comparative
*NL*
insignificance
.
She
was
not
so
dull
but
that
she
could
perceive
*NL*
they
were
but
three
small
rooms
in
a
moderately
well-furnished
*NL*
boarding-house
.
She
was
not
contrasting
it
now
with
what
she
had
had
,
*NL*
but
what
she
had
so
recently
seen
.
The
glow
of
the
palatial
doors
was
*NL*
still
in
her
eye
,
the
roll
of
cushioned
carriages
still
in
her
ears
.
*NL*
What
,
after
all
,
was
Drouet
?
What
was
she
?
At
her
window
,
she
thought
it
*NL*
over
,
rocking
to
and
fro
,
and
gazing
out
across
the
lamp-lit
park
toward
*NL*
the
lamp-lit
houses
on
Warren
and
Ashland
avenues
.
She
was
too
wrought
*NL*
up
to
care
to
go
down
to
eat
,
too
pensive
to
do
aught
but
rock
and
sing
.
*NL*
Some
old
tunes
crept
to
her
lips
,
and
,
as
she
sang
them
,
her
heart
sank
.
*NL*
She
longed
and
longed
and
longed
.
It
was
now
for
the
old
cottage
room
in
*NL*
Columbia
City
,
now
the
mansion
upon
the
Shore
Drive
,
now
the
fine
*NL*
dress
of
some
lady
,
now
the
elegance
of
some
scene
.
She
was
sad
beyond
*NL*
measure
,
and
yet
uncertain
,
wishing
,
fancying
.
Finally
,
it
seemed
as
*NL*
if
all
her
state
was
one
of
loneliness
and
forsakenness
,
and
she
could
*NL*
scarce
refrain
from
trembling
at
the
lip
.
She
hummed
and
hummed
as
the
*NL*
moments
went
by
,
sitting
in
the
shadow
by
the
window
,
and
was
therein
as
*NL*
happy
,
though
she
did
not
perceive
it
,
as
she
ever
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Carrie
was
still
in
this
frame
of
mind
,
the
house-servant
brought
*NL*
up
the
intelligence
that
Mr.
Hurstwood
was
in
the
parlour
asking
to
see
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
he
does
n't
know
that
Charlie
is
out
of
town
,
''
thought
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
seen
comparatively
little
of
the
manager
during
the
winter
,
*NL*
but
had
been
kept
constantly
in
mind
of
him
by
one
thing
and
another
,
*NL*
principally
by
the
strong
impression
he
had
made
.
She
was
quite
*NL*
disturbed
for
the
moment
as
to
her
appearance
,
but
soon
satisfied
*NL*
herself
by
the
aid
of
the
mirror
,
and
went
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
in
his
best
form
,
as
usual
.
He
had
n't
heard
that
Drouet
*NL*
was
out
of
town
.
He
was
but
slightly
affected
by
the
intelligence
,
and
*NL*
devoted
himself
to
the
more
general
topics
which
would
interest
Carrie
.
*NL*
It
was
surprising
--
the
ease
with
which
he
conducted
a
conversation
.
He
*NL*
was
like
every
man
who
has
had
the
advantage
of
practice
and
knows
he
*NL*
has
sympathy
.
He
knew
that
Carrie
listened
to
him
pleasurably
,
and
,
*NL*
without
the
least
effort
,
he
fell
into
a
train
of
observation
which
*NL*
absorbed
her
fancy
.
He
drew
up
his
chair
and
modulated
his
voice
to
*NL*
such
a
degree
that
what
he
said
seemed
wholly
confidential
.
He
confined
*NL*
himself
almost
exclusively
to
his
observation
of
men
and
pleasures
.
*NL*
He
had
been
here
and
there
,
he
had
seen
this
and
that
.
Somehow
he
made
*NL*
Carrie
wish
to
see
similar
things
,
and
all
the
while
kept
her
aware
of
*NL*
himself
.
She
could
not
shut
out
the
consciousness
of
his
individuality
*NL*
and
presence
for
a
moment
.
He
would
raise
his
eyes
slowly
in
smiling
*NL*
emphasis
of
something
,
and
she
was
fixed
by
their
magnetism
.
He
would
*NL*
draw
out
,
with
the
easiest
grace
,
her
approval
.
Once
he
touched
her
hand
*NL*
for
emphasis
and
she
only
smiled
.
He
seemed
to
radiate
an
atmosphere
*NL*
which
suffused
her
being
.
He
was
never
dull
for
a
minute
,
and
seemed
to
*NL*
make
her
clever
.
At
least
,
she
brightened
under
his
influence
until
all
*NL*
her
best
side
was
exhibited
.
She
felt
that
she
was
more
clever
with
him
*NL*
than
with
others
.
At
least
,
he
seemed
to
find
so
much
in
her
to
applaud
.
*NL*
There
was
not
the
slightest
touch
of
patronage
.
Drouet
was
full
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
something
so
personal
,
so
subtle
,
in
each
meeting
between
*NL*
them
,
both
when
Drouet
was
present
and
when
he
was
absent
,
that
Carrie
*NL*
could
not
speak
of
it
without
feeling
a
sense
of
difficulty
.
She
was
*NL*
no
talker
.
She
could
never
arrange
her
thoughts
in
fluent
order
.
It
was
*NL*
always
a
matter
of
feeling
with
her
,
strong
and
deep
.
Each
time
there
*NL*
had
been
no
sentence
of
importance
which
she
could
relate
,
and
as
for
*NL*
the
glances
and
sensations
,
what
woman
would
reveal
them
?
Such
things
*NL*
had
never
been
between
her
and
Drouet
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
they
could
*NL*
never
be
.
She
had
been
dominated
by
distress
and
the
enthusiastic
forces
*NL*
of
relief
which
Drouet
represented
at
an
opportune
moment
when
she
*NL*
yielded
to
him
.
Now
she
was
persuaded
by
secret
current
feelings
which
*NL*
Drouet
had
never
understood
.
Hurstwood
's
glance
was
as
effective
as
*NL*
the
spoken
words
of
a
lover
,
and
more
.
They
called
for
no
immediate
*NL*
decision
,
and
could
not
be
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
in
general
attach
too
much
importance
to
words
.
They
are
under
*NL*
the
illusion
that
talking
effects
great
results
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
*NL*
words
are
,
as
a
rule
,
the
shallowest
portion
of
all
the
argument
.
They
*NL*
but
dimly
represent
the
great
surging
feelings
and
desires
which
*NL*
lie
behind
.
When
the
distraction
of
the
tongue
is
removed
,
the
heart
*NL*
listens
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
conversation
she
heard
,
instead
of
his
words
,
the
voices
of
*NL*
the
things
which
he
represented
.
How
suave
was
the
counsel
of
his
*NL*
appearance
!
How
feelingly
did
his
superior
state
speak
for
itself
!
The
*NL*
growing
desire
he
felt
for
her
lay
upon
her
spirit
as
a
gentle
hand
.
She
*NL*
did
not
need
to
tremble
at
all
,
because
it
was
invisible
;
she
did
not
*NL*
need
to
worry
over
what
other
people
would
say
--
what
she
herself
*NL*
would
say
--
because
it
had
no
tangibility
.
She
was
being
pleaded
with
,
*NL*
persuaded
,
led
into
denying
old
rights
and
assuming
new
ones
,
and
yet
*NL*
there
were
no
words
to
prove
it
.
Such
conversation
as
was
indulged
in
*NL*
held
the
same
relationship
to
the
actual
mental
enactments
of
the
twain
*NL*
that
the
low
music
of
the
orchestra
does
to
the
dramatic
incident
which
*NL*
it
is
used
to
cover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
seen
the
houses
along
the
Lake
Shore
on
the
North
Side
?
''
*NL*
asked
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
was
just
over
there
this
afternoon
--
Mrs.
Hale
and
I.
Are
n't
they
*NL*
beautiful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
very
fine
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
me
,
''
said
Carrie
,
pensively
.
``
I
wish
I
could
live
in
such
a
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
happy
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
slowly
,
after
a
slight
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
raised
his
eyes
solemnly
and
was
looking
into
her
own
.
He
assumed
*NL*
that
he
had
struck
a
deep
chord
.
Now
was
a
slight
chance
to
say
a
word
*NL*
in
his
own
behalf
.
He
leaned
over
quietly
and
continued
his
steady
gaze
.
*NL*
He
felt
the
critical
character
of
the
period
.
She
endeavoured
to
stir
,
*NL*
but
it
was
useless
.
The
whole
strength
of
a
man
's
nature
was
working
.
He
*NL*
had
good
cause
to
urge
him
on
.
He
looked
and
looked
,
and
the
longer
the
*NL*
situation
lasted
the
more
difficult
it
became
.
The
little
shop-girl
was
*NL*
getting
into
deep
water
.
She
was
letting
her
few
supports
float
away
*NL*
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
said
at
last
,
``
you
must
n't
look
at
me
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
relaxed
a
little
and
let
the
situation
endure
,
giving
him
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
satisfied
with
life
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
,
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
he
was
the
master
of
the
situation
--
he
felt
it
.
He
reached
over
*NL*
and
touched
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
jumping
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
intend
to
,
''
he
answered
,
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
run
away
,
as
she
might
have
done
.
She
did
not
terminate
the
*NL*
interview
,
but
he
drifted
off
into
a
pleasant
field
of
thought
with
the
*NL*
readiest
grace
.
Not
long
after
he
rose
to
go
,
and
she
felt
that
he
*NL*
was
in
power
.
``
You
must
n't
feel
bad
,
''
he
said
,
kindly
;
``
things
will
*NL*
straighten
out
in
the
course
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
answer
,
because
she
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
good
friends
,
are
n't
we
?
''
he
said
,
extending
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word
,
then
,
until
I
see
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
retained
a
hold
on
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
promise
,
''
she
said
,
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
more
generous
than
that
,
''
he
said
,
in
such
a
simple
way
*NL*
that
she
was
touched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
not
talk
about
it
any
more
,
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
said
,
brightening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
down
the
steps
and
into
his
cab
.
Carrie
closed
the
door
and
*NL*
ascended
into
her
room
.
She
undid
her
broad
lace
collar
before
the
*NL*
mirror
and
unfastened
her
pretty
alligator
belt
which
she
had
recently
*NL*
bought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
getting
terrible
,
''
she
said
,
honestly
affected
by
a
feeling
of
*NL*
trouble
and
shame
.
``
I
do
n't
seem
to
do
anything
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
unloosed
her
hair
after
a
time
,
and
let
it
hang
in
loose
brown
*NL*
waves
.
Her
mind
was
going
over
the
events
of
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
murmured
at
last
,
``
what
I
can
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Hurstwood
as
he
rode
away
,
``
she
likes
me
all
right
;
that
I
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
aroused
manager
whistled
merrily
for
a
good
four
miles
to
his
office
*NL*
an
old
melody
that
he
had
not
recalled
for
fifteen
years
.

HIS
CREDENTIALS
ACCEPTED
--
A
BABEL
OF
TONGUES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
quite
two
days
after
the
scene
between
Carrie
and
Hurstwood
*NL*
in
the
Ogden
Place
parlour
before
he
again
put
in
his
appearance
.
He
had
*NL*
been
thinking
almost
uninterruptedly
of
her
.
Her
leniency
had
,
in
a
way
,
*NL*
inflamed
his
regard
.
He
felt
that
he
must
succeed
with
her
,
and
that
*NL*
speedily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reason
for
his
interest
,
not
to
say
fascination
,
was
deeper
than
*NL*
mere
desire
.
It
was
a
flowering
out
of
feelings
which
had
been
withering
*NL*
in
dry
and
almost
barren
soil
for
many
years
.
It
is
probable
that
Carrie
*NL*
represented
a
better
order
of
woman
than
had
ever
attracted
him
before
.
*NL*
He
had
had
no
love
affair
since
that
which
culminated
in
his
marriage
,
*NL*
and
since
then
time
and
the
world
had
taught
him
how
raw
and
erroneous
*NL*
was
his
original
judgment
.
Whenever
he
thought
of
it
,
he
told
himself
*NL*
that
,
if
he
had
it
to
do
over
again
,
he
would
never
marry
such
a
woman
.
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
his
experience
with
women
in
general
had
lessened
his
*NL*
respect
for
the
sex
.
He
maintained
a
cynical
attitude
,
well
grounded
*NL*
on
numerous
experiences
.
Such
women
as
he
had
known
were
of
nearly
*NL*
one
type
,
selfish
,
ignorant
,
flashy
.
The
wives
of
his
friends
were
not
*NL*
inspiring
to
look
upon
.
His
own
wife
had
developed
a
cold
,
commonplace
*NL*
nature
which
to
him
was
anything
but
pleasing
.
What
he
knew
of
that
*NL*
under-world
where
grovel
the
beat-men
of
society
-LRB-
and
he
knew
a
*NL*
great
deal
-RRB-
had
hardened
his
nature
.
He
looked
upon
most
women
with
*NL*
suspicion
--
a
single
eye
to
the
utility
of
beauty
and
dress
.
He
followed
*NL*
them
with
a
keen
,
suggestive
glance
.
At
the
same
time
,
he
was
not
so
*NL*
dull
but
that
a
good
woman
commanded
his
respect
.
Personally
,
he
did
not
*NL*
attempt
to
analyse
the
marvel
of
a
saintly
woman
.
He
would
take
off
*NL*
his
hat
,
and
would
silence
the
light-tongued
and
the
vicious
in
her
*NL*
presence
--
much
as
the
Irish
keeper
of
a
Bowery
hall
will
humble
himself
*NL*
before
a
Sister
of
Mercy
,
and
pay
toll
to
charity
with
a
willing
and
*NL*
reverent
hand
.
But
he
would
not
think
much
upon
the
question
of
why
he
*NL*
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
in
his
situation
who
comes
,
after
a
long
round
of
worthless
or
*NL*
hardening
experiences
,
upon
a
young
,
unsophisticated
,
innocent
soul
,
is
*NL*
apt
either
to
hold
aloof
,
out
of
a
sense
of
his
own
remoteness
,
or
to
*NL*
draw
near
and
become
fascinated
and
elated
by
his
discovery
.
It
is
only
*NL*
by
a
roundabout
process
that
such
men
ever
do
draw
near
such
a
girl
.
*NL*
They
have
no
method
,
no
understanding
of
how
to
ingratiate
themselves
*NL*
in
youthful
favour
,
save
when
they
find
virtue
in
the
toils
.
If
,
*NL*
unfortunately
,
the
fly
has
got
caught
in
the
net
,
the
spider
can
come
*NL*
forth
and
talk
business
upon
its
own
terms
.
So
when
maidenhood
has
*NL*
wandered
into
the
moil
of
the
city
,
when
it
is
brought
within
the
circle
*NL*
of
the
``
rounder
''
and
the
roue
,
even
though
it
be
at
the
outermost
rim
,
*NL*
they
can
come
forth
and
use
their
alluring
arts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
had
gone
,
at
Drouet
's
invitation
,
to
meet
a
new
baggage
of
*NL*
fine
clothes
and
pretty
features
.
He
entered
,
expecting
to
indulge
in
*NL*
an
evening
of
lightsome
frolic
,
and
then
lose
track
of
the
newcomer
*NL*
forever
.
Instead
he
found
a
woman
whose
youth
and
beauty
attracted
him
.
*NL*
In
the
mild
light
of
Carrie
's
eye
was
nothing
of
the
calculation
of
*NL*
the
mistress
.
In
the
diffident
manner
was
nothing
of
the
art
of
the
*NL*
courtesan
.
He
saw
at
once
that
a
mistake
had
been
made
,
that
some
*NL*
difficult
conditions
had
pushed
this
troubled
creature
into
his
*NL*
presence
,
and
his
interest
was
enlisted
.
Here
sympathy
sprang
to
the
*NL*
rescue
,
but
it
was
not
unmixed
with
selfishness
.
He
wanted
to
win
Carrie
*NL*
because
he
thought
her
fate
mingled
with
his
was
better
than
if
it
were
*NL*
united
with
Drouet
's
.
He
envied
the
drummer
his
conquest
as
he
had
never
*NL*
envied
any
man
in
all
the
course
of
his
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
certainly
better
than
this
man
,
as
she
was
superior
,
*NL*
mentally
,
to
Drouet
.
She
came
fresh
from
the
air
of
the
village
,
the
*NL*
light
of
the
country
still
in
her
eye
.
Here
was
neither
guile
nor
*NL*
rapacity
.
There
were
slight
inherited
traits
of
both
in
her
,
but
they
*NL*
were
rudimentary
.
She
was
too
full
of
wonder
and
desire
to
be
greedy
.
*NL*
She
still
looked
about
her
upon
the
great
maze
of
the
city
without
*NL*
understanding
.
Hurstwood
felt
the
bloom
and
the
youth
.
He
picked
her
as
*NL*
he
would
the
fresh
fruit
of
a
tree
.
He
felt
as
fresh
in
her
presence
as
*NL*
one
who
is
taken
out
of
the
flash
of
summer
to
the
first
cool
breath
of
*NL*
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
,
left
alone
since
the
scene
in
question
,
and
having
no
one
*NL*
with
whom
to
counsel
,
had
at
first
wandered
from
one
strange
mental
*NL*
conclusion
to
another
,
until
at
last
,
tired
out
,
she
gave
it
up
.
*NL*
She
owed
something
to
Drouet
,
she
thought
.
It
did
not
seem
more
than
*NL*
yesterday
that
he
had
aided
her
when
she
was
worried
and
distressed
.
She
*NL*
had
the
kindliest
feelings
for
him
in
every
way
.
She
gave
him
credit
*NL*
for
his
good
looks
,
his
generous
feelings
,
and
even
,
in
fact
,
failed
*NL*
to
recollect
his
egotism
when
he
was
absent
;
but
she
could
not
feel
any
*NL*
binding
influence
keeping
her
for
him
as
against
all
others
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
such
a
thought
had
never
had
any
grounding
,
even
in
Drouet
's
desires
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
is
,
that
this
goodly
drummer
carried
the
doom
of
all
enduring
*NL*
relationships
in
his
own
lightsome
manner
and
unstable
fancy
.
He
went
*NL*
merrily
on
,
assured
that
he
was
alluring
all
,
that
affection
followed
*NL*
tenderly
in
his
wake
,
that
things
would
endure
unchangingly
for
his
*NL*
pleasure
.
When
he
missed
some
old
face
,
or
found
some
door
finally
shut
*NL*
to
him
,
it
did
not
grieve
him
deeply
.
He
was
too
young
,
too
successful
.
*NL*
He
would
remain
thus
young
in
spirit
until
he
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Hurstwood
,
he
was
alive
with
thoughts
and
feelings
concerning
*NL*
Carrie
.
He
had
no
definite
plans
regarding
her
,
but
he
was
determined
to
*NL*
make
her
confess
an
affection
for
him
.
He
thought
he
saw
in
her
drooping
*NL*
eye
,
her
unstable
glance
,
her
wavering
manner
,
the
symptoms
of
a
budding
*NL*
passion
.
He
wanted
to
stand
near
her
and
make
her
lay
her
hand
in
*NL*
his
--
he
wanted
to
find
out
what
her
next
step
would
be
--
what
the
next
*NL*
sign
of
feeling
for
him
would
be
.
Such
anxiety
and
enthusiasm
had
not
*NL*
affected
him
for
years
.
He
was
a
youth
again
in
feeling
--
a
cavalier
in
*NL*
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
position
opportunity
for
taking
his
evenings
out
was
excellent
.
*NL*
He
was
a
most
faithful
worker
in
general
,
and
a
man
who
commanded
the
*NL*
confidence
of
his
employers
in
so
far
as
the
distribution
of
his
time
*NL*
was
concerned
.
He
could
take
such
hours
off
as
he
chose
,
for
it
was
well
*NL*
known
that
he
fulfilled
his
managerial
duties
successfully
,
whatever
*NL*
time
he
might
take
.
His
grace
,
tact
,
and
ornate
appearance
gave
the
*NL*
place
an
air
which
was
most
essential
,
while
at
the
same
time
his
long
*NL*
experience
made
him
a
most
excellent
judge
of
its
stock
necessities
.
*NL*
Bartenders
and
assistants
might
come
and
go
,
singly
or
in
groups
,
but
,
*NL*
so
long
as
he
was
present
,
the
host
of
old-time
customers
would
barely
*NL*
notice
the
change
.
He
gave
the
place
the
atmosphere
to
which
they
were
*NL*
used
.
Consequently
,
he
arranged
his
hours
very
much
to
suit
himself
,
*NL*
taking
now
an
afternoon
,
now
an
evening
,
but
invariably
returning
*NL*
between
eleven
and
twelve
to
witness
the
last
hour
or
two
of
the
day
's
*NL*
business
and
look
after
the
closing
details
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
that
things
are
safe
and
all
the
employees
are
out
when
you
go
*NL*
home
,
George
,
''
Moy
had
once
remarked
to
him
,
and
he
never
once
,
in
all
*NL*
the
period
of
his
long
service
,
neglected
to
do
this
.
Neither
of
the
*NL*
owners
had
for
years
been
in
the
resort
after
five
in
the
afternoon
,
and
*NL*
yet
their
manager
as
faithfully
fulfilled
this
request
as
if
they
had
*NL*
been
there
regularly
to
observe
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
Friday
afternoon
,
scarcely
two
days
after
his
previous
visit
,
he
*NL*
made
up
his
mind
to
see
Carrie
.
He
could
not
stay
away
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Evans
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
the
head
barkeeper
,
``
if
any
one
calls
,
I
*NL*
will
be
back
between
four
and
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
to
Madison
Street
and
boarded
a
horse-car
,
which
carried
him
*NL*
to
Ogden
Place
in
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
thought
of
going
for
a
walk
,
and
had
put
on
a
light
grey
*NL*
woollen
dress
with
a
jaunty
double-breasted
jacket
.
She
had
out
her
hat
*NL*
and
gloves
,
and
was
fastening
a
white
lace
tie
about
her
throat
when
the
*NL*
housemaid
brought
up
the
information
that
Mr.
Hurstwood
wished
to
see
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
slightly
at
the
announcement
,
but
told
the
girl
to
say
that
*NL*
she
would
come
down
in
a
moment
,
and
proceeded
to
hasten
her
dressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
could
not
have
told
herself
at
this
moment
whether
she
was
glad
*NL*
or
sorry
that
the
impressive
manager
was
awaiting
her
presence
.
She
*NL*
was
slightly
flurried
and
tingling
in
the
cheeks
,
but
it
was
more
*NL*
nervousness
than
either
fear
or
favour
.
She
did
not
try
to
conjecture
*NL*
what
the
drift
of
the
conversation
would
be
.
She
only
felt
that
she
must
*NL*
be
careful
,
and
that
Hurstwood
had
an
indefinable
fascination
for
her
.
*NL*
Then
she
gave
her
tie
its
last
touch
with
her
fingers
and
went
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deep-feeling
manager
was
himself
a
little
strained
in
the
nerves
by
*NL*
the
thorough
consciousness
of
his
mission
.
He
felt
that
he
must
make
*NL*
a
strong
play
on
this
occasion
,
but
now
that
the
hour
was
come
,
and
*NL*
he
heard
Carrie
's
feet
upon
the
stair
,
his
nerve
failed
him
.
He
sank
*NL*
a
little
in
determination
,
for
he
was
not
so
sure
,
after
all
,
what
her
*NL*
opinion
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
entered
the
room
,
however
,
her
appearance
gave
him
courage
.
She
*NL*
looked
simple
and
charming
enough
to
strengthen
the
daring
of
any
lover
.
*NL*
Her
apparent
nervousness
dispelled
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
?
''
he
said
,
easily
.
``
I
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
*NL*
come
out
this
afternoon
,
it
was
so
pleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Carrie
,
halting
before
him
,
``
I
was
just
preparing
to
go
for
*NL*
a
walk
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
were
you
?
''
he
said
.
``
Supposing
,
then
,
you
get
your
hat
and
we
both
*NL*
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
crossed
the
park
and
went
west
along
Washington
Boulevard
,
*NL*
beautiful
with
its
broad
macadamised
road
,
and
large
frame
houses
*NL*
set
back
from
the
sidewalks
.
It
was
a
street
where
many
of
the
more
*NL*
prosperous
residents
of
the
West
Side
lived
,
and
Hurstwood
could
not
*NL*
help
feeling
nervous
over
the
publicity
of
it
.
They
had
gone
but
a
few
*NL*
blocks
when
a
livery
stable
sign
in
one
of
the
side
streets
solved
the
*NL*
difficulty
for
him
.
He
would
take
her
to
drive
along
the
new
Boulevard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Boulevard
at
that
time
was
little
more
than
a
country
road
.
The
part
*NL*
he
intended
showing
her
was
much
farther
out
on
this
same
West
Side
,
*NL*
where
there
was
scarcely
a
house
.
It
connected
Douglas
Park
with
*NL*
Washington
or
South
Park
,
and
was
nothing
more
than
a
neatly
MADE
road
,
*NL*
running
due
south
for
some
five
miles
over
an
open
,
grassy
prairie
,
and
*NL*
then
due
east
over
the
same
kind
of
prairie
for
the
same
distance
.
There
*NL*
was
not
a
house
to
be
encountered
anywhere
along
the
larger
part
of
the
*NL*
route
,
and
any
conversation
would
be
pleasantly
free
of
interruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
stable
he
picked
a
gentle
horse
,
and
they
were
soon
out
of
range
*NL*
of
either
public
observation
or
hearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
drive
?
''
he
said
,
after
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
tried
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
the
reins
in
her
hand
,
and
folded
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
there
's
nothing
to
it
much
,
''
he
said
,
smilingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
when
you
have
a
gentle
horse
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
handle
a
horse
as
well
as
any
one
,
after
a
little
practice
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
encouragingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
looking
for
some
time
for
a
break
in
the
conversation
when
*NL*
he
could
give
it
a
serious
turn
.
Once
or
twice
he
had
held
his
peace
,
*NL*
hoping
that
in
silence
her
thoughts
would
take
the
colour
of
his
own
,
*NL*
but
she
had
lightly
continued
the
subject
.
Presently
,
however
,
his
*NL*
silence
controlled
the
situation
.
The
drift
of
his
thoughts
began
to
*NL*
tell
.
He
gazed
fixedly
at
nothing
in
particular
,
as
if
he
were
thinking
*NL*
of
something
which
concerned
her
not
at
all
.
His
thoughts
,
however
,
*NL*
spoke
for
themselves
.
She
was
very
much
aware
that
a
climax
was
pending
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
have
spent
the
happiest
evenings
in
years
*NL*
since
I
have
known
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
?
''
she
said
,
with
assumed
airiness
,
but
still
excited
by
the
*NL*
conviction
which
the
tone
of
his
voice
carried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
tell
you
the
other
evening
,
''
he
added
,
``
but
somehow
the
*NL*
opportunity
slipped
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
listening
without
attempting
to
reply
.
She
could
think
of
*NL*
nothing
worth
while
to
say
.
Despite
all
the
ideas
concerning
right
*NL*
which
had
troubled
her
vaguely
since
she
had
last
seen
him
,
she
was
now
*NL*
influenced
again
strongly
in
his
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
out
here
to-day
,
''
he
went
on
,
solemnly
,
``
to
tell
you
just
how
I
*NL*
feel
--
to
see
if
you
would
n't
listen
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
something
of
a
romanticist
after
his
kind
.
He
was
capable
*NL*
of
strong
feelings
--
often
poetic
ones
--
and
under
a
stress
of
desire
,
*NL*
such
as
the
present
,
he
waxed
eloquent
.
That
is
,
his
feelings
and
his
*NL*
voice
were
coloured
with
that
seeming
repression
and
pathos
which
is
the
*NL*
essence
of
eloquence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
he
said
,
putting
his
hand
on
her
arm
,
and
keeping
a
strange
*NL*
silence
while
he
formulated
words
,
``
that
I
love
you
?
''
Carrie
did
not
*NL*
stir
at
the
words
.
She
was
bound
up
completely
in
the
man
's
atmosphere
.
*NL*
He
would
have
churchlike
silence
in
order
to
express
his
feelings
,
and
*NL*
she
kept
it
.
She
did
not
move
her
eyes
from
the
flat
,
open
scene
before
*NL*
her
.
Hurstwood
waited
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
repeated
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
say
that
,
''
she
said
,
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
words
were
not
convincing
at
all
.
They
were
the
result
of
a
feeble
*NL*
thought
that
something
ought
to
be
said
.
He
paid
no
attention
to
them
*NL*
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
,
''
he
said
,
using
her
first
name
with
sympathetic
familiarity
,
``
I
*NL*
want
you
to
love
me
.
You
do
n't
know
how
much
I
need
some
one
to
waste
a
*NL*
little
affection
on
me
.
I
am
practically
alone
.
There
is
nothing
in
my
*NL*
life
that
is
pleasant
or
delightful
.
It
's
all
work
and
worry
with
people
*NL*
who
are
nothing
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
,
Hurstwood
really
imagined
that
his
state
was
*NL*
pitiful
.
He
had
the
ability
to
get
off
at
a
distance
and
view
himself
*NL*
objectively
--
of
seeing
what
he
wanted
to
see
in
the
things
which
made
up
*NL*
his
existence
.
Now
,
as
he
spoke
,
his
voice
trembled
with
that
peculiar
*NL*
vibration
which
is
the
result
of
tensity
.
It
went
ringing
home
to
his
*NL*
companion
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
should
think
,
''
she
said
,
turning
upon
him
large
eyes
which
were
*NL*
full
of
sympathy
and
feeling
,
``
that
you
would
be
very
happy
.
You
know
so
*NL*
much
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
it
,
''
he
said
,
his
voice
dropping
to
a
soft
minor
,
``
I
know
too
*NL*
much
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
important
thing
to
her
to
hear
one
so
well-positioned
and
*NL*
powerful
speaking
in
this
manner
.
She
could
not
help
feeling
the
*NL*
strangeness
of
her
situation
.
How
was
it
that
,
in
so
little
a
while
,
*NL*
the
narrow
life
of
the
country
had
fallen
from
her
as
a
garment
,
and
*NL*
the
city
,
with
all
its
mystery
,
taken
its
place
?
Here
was
this
greatest
*NL*
mystery
,
the
man
of
money
and
affairs
sitting
beside
her
,
appealing
*NL*
to
her
.
Behold
,
he
had
ease
and
comfort
,
his
strength
was
great
,
his
*NL*
position
high
,
his
clothing
rich
,
and
yet
he
was
appealing
to
her
.
She
*NL*
could
formulate
no
thought
which
would
be
just
and
right
.
She
troubled
*NL*
herself
no
more
upon
the
matter
.
She
only
basked
in
the
warmth
of
his
*NL*
feeling
,
which
was
as
a
grateful
blaze
to
one
who
is
cold
.
Hurstwood
*NL*
glowed
with
his
own
intensity
,
and
the
heat
of
his
passion
was
already
*NL*
melting
the
wax
of
his
companion
's
scruples
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
am
happy
;
that
I
ought
not
to
complain
?
If
you
*NL*
were
to
meet
all
day
with
people
who
care
absolutely
nothing
about
you
,
*NL*
if
you
went
day
after
day
to
a
place
where
there
was
nothing
but
show
*NL*
and
indifference
,
if
there
was
not
one
person
in
all
those
you
knew
to
*NL*
whom
you
could
appeal
for
sympathy
or
talk
to
with
pleasure
,
perhaps
you
*NL*
would
be
unhappy
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
striking
a
chord
now
which
found
sympathetic
response
in
her
*NL*
own
situation
.
She
knew
what
it
was
to
meet
with
people
who
were
*NL*
indifferent
,
to
walk
alone
amid
so
many
who
cared
absolutely
nothing
*NL*
about
you
.
Had
not
she
?
Was
not
she
at
this
very
moment
quite
alone
?
Who
*NL*
was
there
among
all
whom
she
knew
to
whom
she
could
appeal
for
sympathy
?
*NL*
Not
one
.
She
was
left
to
herself
to
brood
and
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
be
content
,
''
went
on
Hurstwood
,
``
if
I
had
you
to
love
me
.
If
*NL*
I
had
you
to
go
to
;
you
for
a
companion
.
As
it
is
,
I
simply
move
about
*NL*
from
place
to
place
without
any
satisfaction
.
Time
hangs
heavily
on
my
*NL*
hands
.
Before
you
came
I
did
nothing
but
idle
and
drift
into
anything
*NL*
that
offered
itself
.
Since
you
came
--
well
,
I
've
had
you
to
think
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
illusion
that
here
was
some
one
who
needed
her
aid
began
to
grow
*NL*
in
Carrie
's
mind
.
She
truly
pitied
this
sad
,
lonely
figure
.
To
think
*NL*
that
all
his
fine
state
should
be
so
barren
for
want
of
her
;
that
he
*NL*
needed
to
make
such
an
appeal
when
she
herself
was
lonely
and
without
*NL*
anchor
.
Surely
,
this
was
too
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
very
bad
,
''
he
said
,
apologetically
,
as
if
he
owed
it
to
her
to
*NL*
explain
on
this
score
.
``
You
think
,
probably
,
that
I
roam
around
,
and
get
*NL*
into
all
sorts
of
evil
?
I
have
been
rather
reckless
,
but
I
could
easily
*NL*
come
out
of
that
.
I
need
you
to
draw
me
back
,
if
my
life
ever
amounts
to
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
with
the
tenderness
which
virtue
ever
feels
in
*NL*
its
hope
of
reclaiming
vice
.
How
could
such
a
man
need
reclaiming
?
His
*NL*
errors
,
what
were
they
,
that
she
could
correct
?
Small
they
must
be
,
*NL*
where
all
was
so
fine
.
At
worst
,
they
were
gilded
affairs
,
and
with
what
*NL*
leniency
are
gilded
errors
viewed
.
He
put
himself
in
such
a
lonely
light
*NL*
that
she
was
deeply
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
that
way
?
''
she
mused
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
slipped
his
arm
about
her
waist
,
and
she
could
not
find
the
heart
to
*NL*
draw
away
.
With
his
free
hand
he
seized
upon
her
fingers
.
A
breath
of
*NL*
soft
spring
wind
went
bounding
over
the
road
,
rolling
some
brown
*NL*
twigs
of
the
previous
autumn
before
it
.
The
horse
paced
leisurely
on
,
*NL*
unguided
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
he
said
,
softly
,
``
that
you
love
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
fell
consciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Own
to
it
,
dear
,
''
he
said
,
feelingly
;
``
you
do
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
answer
,
but
he
felt
his
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
''
he
said
,
richly
,
drawing
her
so
close
that
their
lips
were
*NL*
near
together
.
He
pressed
her
hand
warmly
,
and
then
released
it
to
touch
*NL*
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
?
''
he
said
,
pressing
his
lips
to
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
answer
,
her
lips
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
he
said
,
joyously
,
his
fine
eyes
ablaze
,
``
you
're
my
own
girl
,
*NL*
are
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
way
of
further
conclusion
,
her
head
lay
softly
upon
his
shoulder
.

WITH
EYES
AND
NOT
SEEING
--
ONE
INFLUENCE
WANES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
in
her
rooms
that
evening
was
in
a
fine
glow
,
physically
and
*NL*
mentally
.
She
was
deeply
rejoicing
in
her
affection
for
Hurstwood
and
*NL*
his
love
,
and
looked
forward
with
fine
fancy
to
their
next
meeting
*NL*
Sunday
night
.
They
had
agreed
,
without
any
feeling
of
enforced
secrecy
,
*NL*
that
she
should
come
down
town
and
meet
him
,
though
,
after
all
,
the
need
*NL*
of
it
was
the
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hale
,
from
her
upper
window
,
saw
her
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Um
,
''
she
thought
to
herself
,
``
she
goes
riding
with
another
man
when
her
*NL*
husband
is
out
of
the
city
.
He
had
better
keep
an
eye
on
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
is
that
Mrs.
Hale
was
not
the
only
one
who
had
a
thought
on
*NL*
this
score
.
The
housemaid
who
had
welcomed
Hurstwood
had
her
opinion
*NL*
also
.
She
had
no
particular
regard
for
Carrie
,
whom
she
took
to
be
cold
*NL*
and
disagreeable
.
At
the
same
time
,
she
had
a
fancy
for
the
merry
and
*NL*
easy-mannered
Drouet
,
who
threw
her
a
pleasant
remark
now
and
then
,
and
*NL*
in
other
ways
extended
her
the
evidence
of
that
regard
which
he
had
for
*NL*
all
members
of
the
sex
.
Hurstwood
was
more
reserved
and
critical
in
*NL*
his
manner
.
He
did
not
appeal
to
this
bodiced
functionary
in
the
same
*NL*
pleasant
way
.
She
wondered
that
he
came
so
frequently
,
that
Mrs.
Drouet
*NL*
should
go
out
with
him
this
afternoon
when
Mr.
Drouet
was
absent
.
*NL*
She
gave
vent
to
her
opinions
in
the
kitchen
where
the
cook
was
.
As
a
*NL*
result
,
a
hum
of
gossip
was
set
going
which
moved
about
the
house
in
*NL*
that
secret
manner
common
to
gossip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
,
now
that
she
had
yielded
sufficiently
to
Hurstwood
to
confess
*NL*
her
affection
,
no
longer
troubled
about
her
attitude
towards
him
.
*NL*
Temporarily
she
gave
little
thought
to
Drouet
,
thinking
only
of
the
*NL*
dignity
and
grace
of
her
lover
and
of
his
consuming
affection
for
her
.
*NL*
On
the
first
evening
,
she
did
little
but
go
over
the
details
of
the
*NL*
afternoon
.
It
was
the
first
time
her
sympathies
had
ever
been
thoroughly
*NL*
aroused
,
and
they
threw
a
new
light
on
her
character
.
She
had
some
*NL*
power
of
initiative
,
latent
before
,
which
now
began
to
exert
itself
.
She
*NL*
looked
more
practically
upon
her
state
and
began
to
see
glimmerings
of
*NL*
a
way
out
.
Hurstwood
seemed
a
drag
in
the
direction
of
honour
.
Her
*NL*
feelings
were
exceedingly
creditable
,
in
that
they
constructed
out
*NL*
of
these
recent
developments
something
which
conquered
freedom
from
*NL*
dishonour
.
She
had
no
idea
what
Hurstwood
's
next
word
would
be
.
She
*NL*
only
took
his
affection
to
be
a
fine
thing
,
and
appended
better
,
more
*NL*
generous
results
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
yet
,
Hurstwood
had
only
a
thought
of
pleasure
without
responsibility
.
*NL*
He
did
not
feel
that
he
was
doing
anything
to
complicate
his
life
.
His
*NL*
position
was
secure
,
his
home-life
,
if
not
satisfactory
,
was
at
least
*NL*
undisturbed
,
his
personal
liberty
rather
untrammelled
.
Carrie
's
love
*NL*
represented
only
so
much
added
pleasure
.
He
would
enjoy
this
new
gift
*NL*
over
and
above
his
ordinary
allowance
of
pleasure
.
He
would
be
happy
*NL*
with
her
and
his
own
affairs
would
go
on
as
they
had
,
undisturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
evening
Carrie
dined
with
him
at
a
place
he
had
selected
in
*NL*
East
Adams
Street
,
and
thereafter
they
took
a
cab
to
what
was
then
a
*NL*
pleasant
evening
resort
out
on
Cottage
Grove
Avenue
near
39th
Street
.
*NL*
In
the
process
of
his
declaration
he
soon
realised
that
Carrie
took
*NL*
his
love
upon
a
higher
basis
than
he
had
anticipated
.
She
kept
him
at
*NL*
a
distance
in
a
rather
earnest
way
,
and
submitted
only
to
those
tender
*NL*
tokens
of
affection
which
better
become
the
inexperienced
lover
.
*NL*
Hurstwood
saw
that
she
was
not
to
be
possessed
for
the
asking
,
and
*NL*
deferred
pressing
his
suit
too
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
he
feigned
to
believe
in
her
married
state
he
found
that
he
had
to
*NL*
carry
out
the
part
.
His
triumph
,
he
saw
,
was
still
at
a
little
distance
.
*NL*
How
far
he
could
not
guess
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
returning
to
Ogden
Place
in
the
cab
,
when
he
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
I
see
you
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
answered
,
wondering
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
come
down
to
The
Fair
,
''
he
suggested
,
``
next
Tuesday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
soon
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
,
''
he
added
.
``
I
'll
write
you
,
care
of
this
*NL*
West
Side
Post-office
.
Could
you
call
next
Tuesday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cab
stopped
one
door
out
of
the
way
according
to
his
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
he
whispered
,
as
the
cab
rolled
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
for
the
smooth
progression
of
this
affair
,
Drouet
*NL*
returned
.
Hurstwood
was
sitting
in
his
imposing
little
office
the
next
*NL*
afternoon
when
he
saw
Drouet
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
hello
,
Charles
,
''
he
called
affably
;
``
back
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
smiled
Drouet
,
approaching
and
looking
in
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
arose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
looking
the
drummer
over
,
``
rosy
as
ever
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
talking
of
the
people
they
knew
and
things
that
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Been
home
yet
?
''
finally
asked
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
going
,
though
,
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remembered
the
little
girl
out
there
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
``
and
called
*NL*
once
.
Thought
you
would
n't
want
her
left
quite
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
you
are
,
''
agreed
Drouet
.
``
How
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
Rather
anxious
about
you
though
.
You
'd
*NL*
better
go
out
now
and
cheer
her
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Drouet
,
smilingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
to
have
you
both
come
down
and
go
to
the
show
with
me
Wednesday
,
''
*NL*
concluded
Hurstwood
at
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
old
man
,
''
said
his
friend
,
``
I
'll
see
what
the
girl
says
and
let
*NL*
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
separated
in
the
most
cordial
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
nice
fellow
,
''
Drouet
thought
to
himself
as
he
turned
the
*NL*
corner
towards
Madison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drouet
is
a
good
fellow
,
''
Hurstwood
thought
to
himself
as
he
went
back
*NL*
into
his
office
,
``
but
he
's
no
man
for
Carrie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
of
the
latter
turned
his
mind
into
a
most
pleasant
vein
,
and
*NL*
he
wandered
how
he
would
get
ahead
of
the
drummer
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Drouet
entered
Carrie
's
presence
,
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
as
*NL*
usual
,
but
she
responded
to
his
kiss
with
a
tremour
of
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
had
a
great
trip
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
?
How
did
you
come
out
with
that
La
Crosse
man
you
were
telling
*NL*
me
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
fine
;
sold
him
a
complete
line
.
There
was
another
fellow
there
,
*NL*
representing
Burnstein
,
a
regular
hook-nosed
sheeny
,
but
he
was
n't
in
*NL*
it
.
I
made
him
look
like
nothing
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
undid
his
collar
and
unfastened
his
studs
,
preparatory
to
washing
*NL*
his
face
and
changing
his
clothes
,
he
dilated
upon
his
trip
.
Carrie
*NL*
could
not
help
listening
with
amusement
to
his
animated
descriptions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
surprised
the
people
at
the
office
.
I
've
sold
*NL*
more
goods
this
last
quarter
than
any
other
man
of
our
house
on
the
*NL*
road
.
I
sold
three
thousand
dollars
'
worth
in
La
Crosse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
plunged
his
face
in
a
basin
of
water
,
and
puffed
and
blew
as
he
*NL*
rubbed
his
neck
and
ears
with
his
hands
,
while
Carrie
gazed
upon
him
*NL*
with
mingled
thoughts
of
recollection
and
present
judgment
.
He
was
still
*NL*
wiping
his
face
,
when
he
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
strike
for
a
raise
in
June
.
They
can
afford
to
pay
it
,
as
*NL*
much
business
as
I
turn
in
.
I
'll
get
it
too
,
do
n't
you
forget
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
do
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
if
that
little
real
estate
deal
I
've
got
on
goes
through
,
*NL*
we
'll
get
married
,
''
he
said
with
a
great
show
of
earnestness
,
the
while
*NL*
he
took
his
place
before
the
mirror
and
began
brushing
his
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
you
ever
intend
to
marry
me
,
Charlie
,
''
Carrie
said
*NL*
ruefully
.
The
recent
protestations
of
Hurstwood
had
given
her
courage
to
*NL*
say
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
I
do
--
course
I
do
--
what
put
that
into
your
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
stopped
his
trifling
before
the
mirror
now
and
crossed
over
to
*NL*
her
.
For
the
first
time
Carrie
felt
as
if
she
must
move
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
've
been
saying
that
so
long
,
''
she
said
,
looking
with
her
pretty
*NL*
face
upturned
into
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
I
mean
it
too
,
but
it
takes
money
to
live
as
I
want
to
.
*NL*
Now
,
when
I
get
this
increase
,
I
can
come
pretty
near
fixing
things
all
*NL*
right
,
and
I
'll
do
it
.
Now
,
do
n't
you
worry
,
girlie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
patted
her
reassuringly
upon
the
shoulder
,
but
Carrie
felt
how
really
*NL*
futile
had
been
her
hopes
.
She
could
clearly
see
that
this
easy-going
*NL*
soul
intended
no
move
in
her
behalf
.
He
was
simply
letting
things
drift
*NL*
because
he
preferred
the
free
round
of
his
present
state
to
any
legal
*NL*
trammellings
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
contrast
,
Hurstwood
appeared
strong
and
sincere
.
He
had
no
easy
*NL*
manner
of
putting
her
off
.
He
sympathised
with
her
and
showed
her
what
*NL*
her
true
value
was
.
He
needed
her
,
while
Drouet
did
not
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
she
said
remorsefully
,
her
tone
reflecting
some
of
her
own
*NL*
success
and
more
of
her
helplessness
,
``
you
never
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
wait
a
little
while
and
see
,
''
he
concluded
.
``
I
'll
marry
you
*NL*
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
and
felt
justified
.
She
was
looking
for
something
*NL*
which
would
calm
her
conscience
,
and
here
it
was
,
a
light
,
airy
*NL*
disregard
of
her
claims
upon
his
justice
.
He
had
faithfully
promised
to
*NL*
marry
her
,
and
this
was
the
way
he
fulfilled
his
promise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
he
said
,
after
he
had
,
as
he
thought
,
pleasantly
disposed
of
the
*NL*
marriage
question
,
``
I
saw
Hurstwood
to-day
,
and
he
wants
us
to
go
to
the
*NL*
theatre
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
started
at
the
name
,
but
recovered
quickly
enough
to
avoid
*NL*
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
she
asked
,
with
assumed
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wednesday
.
We
'll
go
,
wo
n't
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
think
so
,
''
she
answered
,
her
manner
being
so
enforcedly
reserved
*NL*
as
to
almost
excite
suspicion
.
Drouet
noticed
something
but
he
thought
*NL*
it
was
due
to
her
feelings
concerning
their
talk
about
marriage
.
``
He
*NL*
called
once
,
he
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
he
was
out
here
Sunday
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
he
?
''
said
Drouet
.
``
I
thought
from
what
he
said
that
he
had
called
a
*NL*
week
or
so
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he
did
,
''
answered
Carrie
,
who
was
wholly
unaware
of
what
*NL*
conversation
her
lovers
might
have
held
.
She
was
all
at
sea
mentally
,
*NL*
and
fearful
of
some
entanglement
which
might
ensue
from
what
she
would
*NL*
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
then
he
called
twice
?
''
said
Drouet
,
the
first
shade
of
*NL*
misunderstanding
showing
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Carrie
innocently
,
feeling
now
that
Hurstwood
must
have
*NL*
mentioned
but
one
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
imagined
that
he
must
have
misunderstood
his
friend
.
He
did
not
*NL*
attach
particular
importance
to
the
information
,
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
have
to
say
?
''
he
queried
,
with
slightly
increased
*NL*
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
he
came
because
he
thought
I
might
be
lonely
.
You
had
n't
been
*NL*
in
there
so
long
he
wondered
what
had
become
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
is
a
fine
fellow
,
''
said
Drouet
,
rather
gratified
by
his
*NL*
conception
of
the
manager
's
interest
.
``
Come
on
and
we
'll
go
out
to
*NL*
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Hurstwood
saw
that
Drouet
was
back
he
wrote
at
once
to
Carrie
,
*NL*
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
him
I
called
on
you
,
dearest
,
when
he
was
away
.
I
did
not
say
*NL*
how
often
,
but
he
probably
thought
once
.
Let
me
know
of
anything
you
may
*NL*
have
said
.
Answer
by
special
messenger
when
you
get
this
,
and
,
darling
,
*NL*
I
must
see
you
.
Let
me
know
if
you
ca
n't
meet
me
at
Jackson
and
Throop
*NL*
Streets
Wednesday
afternoon
at
two
o'clock
.
I
want
to
speak
with
you
*NL*
before
we
meet
at
the
theatre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
received
this
Tuesday
morning
when
she
called
at
the
West
Side
*NL*
branch
of
the
post-office
,
and
answered
at

He
did
n't
seem
to
mind

I
will
*NL*
try
and
be
at
Throop
Street

nothing

I
seem
to
be
getting
*NL*
very
bad

It
's
wrong

act
as
I
do

I
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
when
he
met
her
as
agreed
,
reassured
her
on
this
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
worry
,
sweetheart
,
''
he
said
.
``
Just
as
soon
as
he
goes
on
*NL*
the
road
again
we
will
arrange
something
.
We
'll
fix
it
so
that
you
wo
n't
*NL*
have
to
deceive
any
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
imagined
that
he
would
marry
her
at
once
,
though
he
had
not
*NL*
directly
said
so
,
and
her
spirits
rose
.
She
proposed
to
make
the
best
of
*NL*
the
situation
until
Drouet
left
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
show
any
more
interest
in
me
than
you
ever
have
,
''
Hurstwood
*NL*
counselled
concerning
the
evening
at
the
theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
look
at
me
steadily
then
,
''
she
answered
,
mindful
of
the
*NL*
power
of
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
,
''
he
said
,
squeezing
her
hand
at
parting
and
giving
the
glance
*NL*
she
had
just
cautioned
against
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
she
said
playfully
,
pointing
a
finger
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
show
has
n't
begun
yet
,
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
her
walk
from
him
with
tender
solicitation
.
Such
youth
and
*NL*
prettiness
reacted
upon
him
more
subtly
than
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
theatre
things
passed
as
they
had
in
Hurstwood
's
favour
.
If
he
*NL*
had
been
pleasing
to
Carrie
before
,
how
much
more
so
was
he
now
.
His
*NL*
grace
was
more
permeating
because
it
found
a
readier
medium
.
Carrie
*NL*
watched
his
every
movement
with
pleasure
.
She
almost
forgot
poor
Drouet
,
*NL*
who
babbled
on
as
if
he
were
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
too
clever
to
give
the
slightest
indication
of
a
change
.
*NL*
He
paid
,
if
anything
,
more
attention
to
his
old
friend
than
usual
,
*NL*
and
yet
in
no
way
held
him
up
to
that
subtle
ridicule
which
a
lover
in
*NL*
favour
may
so
secretly
practise
before
the
mistress
of
his
heart
.
If
*NL*
anything
,
he
felt
the
injustice
of
the
game
as
it
stood
,
and
was
not
*NL*
cheap
enough
to
add
to
it
the
slightest
mental
taunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
play
produced
an
ironical
situation
,
and
this
was
due
to
Drouet
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
was
one
in
``
The
Covenant
,
''
in
which
the
wife
listened
to
the
*NL*
seductive
voice
of
a
lover
in
the
absence
of
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Served
him
right
,
''
said
Drouet
afterward
,
even
in
view
of
her
keen
*NL*
expiation
of
her
error
.
``
I
have
n't
any
pity
for
a
man
who
would
be
such
*NL*
a
chump
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
never
can
tell
,
''
returned
Hurstwood
gently
.
``
He
probably
*NL*
thought
he
was
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
a
man
ought
to
be
more
attentive
than
that
to
his
wife
if
he
*NL*
wants
to
keep
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
come
out
of
the
lobby
and
made
their
way
through
the
showy
*NL*
crush
about
the
entrance
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
mister
,
''
said
a
voice
at
Hurstwood
's
side
,
``
would
you
mind
giving
*NL*
me
the
price
of
a
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
interestedly
remarking
to
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honest
to
God
,
mister
,
I
'm
without
a
place
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
plea
was
that
of
a
gaunt-faced
man
of
about
thirty
,
who
looked
the
*NL*
picture
of
privation
and
wretchedness
.
Drouet
was
the
first
to
see
.
*NL*
He
handed
over
a
dime
with
an
upwelling
feeling
of
pity
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
Hurstwood
scarcely
noticed
the
incident
.
Carrie
quickly
forgot

Chapter

THE
IRK
OF
THE
OLD
TIES
--
THE
MAGIC
OF
YOUTH
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
complete
ignoring
by
Hurstwood
of
his
own
home
came
with
the
growth
*NL*
of
his
affection
for
Carrie
.
His
actions
,
in
all
that
related
to
his
*NL*
family
,
were
of
the
most
perfunctory
kind
.
He
sat
at
breakfast
with
*NL*
his
wife
and
children
,
absorbed
in
his
own
fancies
,
which
reached
far
*NL*
without
the
realm
of
their
interests
.
He
read
his
paper
,
which
was
*NL*
heightened
in
interest
by
the
shallowness
of
the
themes
discussed
by
*NL*
his
son
and
daughter
.
Between
himself
and
his
wife
ran
a
river
of
*NL*
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
Carrie
had
come
,
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
blissful
again
.
*NL*
There
was
delight
in
going
down
town
evenings
.
When
he
walked
forth
*NL*
in
the
short
days
,
the
street
lamps
had
a
merry
twinkle
.
He
began
to
*NL*
experience
the
almost
forgotten
feeling
which
hastens
the
lover
's
feet
.
*NL*
When
he
looked
at
his
fine
clothes
,
he
saw
them
with
her
eyes
--
and
her
*NL*
eyes
were
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
in
the
flush
of
such
feelings
he
heard
his
wife
's
voice
,
when
*NL*
the
insistent
demands
of
matrimony
recalled
him
from
dreams
to
a
stale
*NL*
practice
,
how
it
grated
.
He
then
knew
that
this
was
a
chain
which
bound
*NL*
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
,
in
that
tone
of
voice
which
had
long
*NL*
since
come
to
be
associated
in
his
mind
with
demands
,
``
we
want
you
to
*NL*
get
us
a
season
ticket
to
the
races
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
go
to
all
of
them
?
''
he
said
with
a
rising
inflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
races
in
question
were
soon
to
open
at
Washington
Park
,
on
the
South
*NL*
Side
,
and
were
considered
quite
society
affairs
among
those
who
did
not
*NL*
affect
religious
rectitude
and
conservatism
.
Mrs.
Hurstwood
had
*NL*
never
asked
for
a
whole
season
ticket
before
,
but
this
year
certain
*NL*
considerations
decided
her
to
get
a
box
.
For
one
thing
,
one
of
her
*NL*
neighbours
,
a
certain
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Ramsey
,
who
were
possessors
of
money
,
*NL*
made
out
of
the
coal
business
,
had
done
so
.
In
the
next
place
,
her
*NL*
favourite
physician
,
Dr.
Beale
,
a
gentleman
inclined
to
horses
and
*NL*
betting
,
had
talked
with
her
concerning
his
intention
to
enter
a
*NL*
two-year-old
in
the
Derby
.
In
the
third
place
,
she
wished
to
exhibit
*NL*
Jessica
,
who
was
gaining
in
maturity
and
beauty
,
and
whom
she
hoped
to
*NL*
marry
to
a
man
of
means
.
Her
own
desire
to
be
about
in
such
things
*NL*
and
parade
among
her
acquaintances
and
common
throng
was
as
much
an
*NL*
incentive
as
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
thought
over
the
proposition
a
few
moments
without
answering
.
*NL*
They
were
in
the
sitting
room
on
the
second
floor
,
waiting
for
supper
.
*NL*
It
was
the
evening
of
his
engagement
with
Carrie
and
Drouet
to
see
``
The
*NL*
Covenant
,
''
which
had
brought
him
home
to
make
some
alterations
in
his
*NL*
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
sure
separate
tickets
would
n't
do
as
well
?
''
he
asked
,
hesitating
*NL*
to
say
anything
more
rugged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
replied
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
taking
offence
at
her
manner
,
``
you
need
n't
get
mad
*NL*
about
it
.
I
'm
just
asking
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
mad
,
''
she
snapped
.
``
I
'm
merely
asking
you
for
a
season
ticket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'm
telling
you
,
''
he
returned
,
fixing
a
clear
,
steady
eye
on
her
,
*NL*
``
that
it
's
no
easy
thing
to
get
.
I
'm
not
sure
whether
the
manager
will
*NL*
give
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
thinking
all
the
time
of
his
``
pull
''
with
the
race-track
*NL*
magnates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
buy
it
then
,
''
she
exclaimed
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
talk
easy
,
''
he
said
.
``
A
season
family
ticket
costs
one
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
dollars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
not
argue
with
you
,
''
she
replied
with
determination
.
``
I
want
the
*NL*
ticket
and
that
's
all
there
is
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
risen
,
and
now
walked
angrily
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
get
it
then
,
''
he
said
grimly
,
though
in
a
modified
tone
of
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
usual
,
the
table
was
one
short
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
he
had
cooled
down
considerably
,
and
later
the
ticket
*NL*
was
duly
secured
,
though
it
did
not
heal
matters
.
He
did
not
mind
giving
*NL*
his
family
a
fair
share
of
all
that
he
earned
,
but
he
did
not
like
to
be
*NL*
forced
to
provide
against
his
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
know
,
mother
,
''
said
Jessica
another
day
,
``
the
Spencers
are
*NL*
getting
ready
to
go
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Where
,
I
wonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Europe
,
''
said
Jessica
.
``
I
met
Georgine
yesterday
and
she
told
me
.
She
*NL*
just
put
on
more
airs
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
say
when
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monday
,
I
think
.
They
'll
get
a
notice
in
the
papers
again
--
they
always
*NL*
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
consolingly
,
``
we
'll
go
one
of
these
*NL*
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
moved
his
eyes
over
the
paper
slowly
,
but
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
We
sail
for
Liverpool
from
New
York
,
'
''
Jessica
exclaimed
,
mocking
her
*NL*
acquaintance
.
''
`
Expect
to
spend
most
of
the
``
summah

in
France
,

--
vain
*NL*
thing

If
it
was
anything
to
go
to

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
if
you
envy
her
so
much
,
''
put
in
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
grated
upon
him
to
see
the
feeling
his
daughter
displayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
worry
over
them
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
George
get
off
?
''
asked
Jessica
of
her
mother
another
day
,
thus
*NL*
revealing
something
that
Hurstwood
had
heard
nothing
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
has
he
gone
?
''
he
asked
,
looking
up
.
He
had
never
before
been
kept
*NL*
in
ignorance
concerning
departures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
going
to
Wheaton
,
''
said
Jessica
,
not
noticing
the
slight
put
*NL*
upon
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
out
there
?
''
he
asked
,
secretly
irritated
and
chagrined
to
think
*NL*
that
he
should
be
made
to
pump
for
information
in
this
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
tennis
match
,
''
said
Jessica
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
say
anything
to
me
,
''
Hurstwood
concluded
,
finding
it
*NL*
difficult
to
refrain
from
a
bitter
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
he
must
have
forgotten
,
''
exclaimed
his
wife
blandly
.
In
the
*NL*
past
he
had
always
commanded
a
certain
amount
of
respect
,
which
was
a
*NL*
compound
of
appreciation
and
awe
.
The
familiarity
which
in
part
still
*NL*
existed
between
himself
and
his
daughter
he
had
courted
.
As
it
was
,
it
*NL*
did
not
go
beyond
the
light
assumption
of
words
.
The
TONE
was
always
*NL*
modest
.
Whatever
had
been
,
however
,
had
lacked
affection
,
and
now
he
saw
*NL*
that
he
was
losing
track
of
their
doings
.
His
knowledge
was
no
longer
*NL*
intimate
.
He
sometimes
saw
them
at
table
,
and
sometimes
did
not
.
He
*NL*
heard
of
their
doings
occasionally
,
more
often
not
.
Some
days
he
found
*NL*
that
he
was
all
at
sea
as
to
what
they
were
talking
about
--
things
they
*NL*
had
arranged
to
do
or
that
they
had
done
in
his
absence
.
More
affecting
*NL*
was
the
feeling
that
there
were
little
things
going
on
of
which
he
no
*NL*
longer
heard
.
Jessica
was
beginning
to
feel
that
her
affairs
were
her
*NL*
own
.
George
,
Jr.
,
flourished
about
as
if
he
were
a
man
entirely
and
must
*NL*
needs
have
private
matters
.
All
this
Hurstwood
could
see
,
and
it
left
a
*NL*
trace
of
feeling
,
for
he
was
used
to
being
considered
--
in
his
official
*NL*
position
,
at
least
--
and
felt
that
his
importance
should
not
begin
*NL*
to
wane
here
.
To
darken
it
all
,
he
saw
the
same
indifference
and
*NL*
independence
growing
in
his
wife
,
while
he
looked
on
and
paid
the
bills
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
consoled
himself
with
the
thought
,
however
,
that
,
after
all
,
he
was
*NL*
not
without
affection
.
Things
might
go
as
they
would
at
his
house
,
but
*NL*
he
had
Carrie
outside
of
it
.
With
his
mind
's
eye
he
looked
into
her
*NL*
comfortable
room
in
Ogden
Place
,
where
he
had
spent
several
such
*NL*
delightful
evenings
,
and
thought
how
charming
it
would
be
when
Drouet
*NL*
was
disposed
of
entirely
and
she
was
waiting
evenings
in
cosey
little
*NL*
quarters
for
him
.
That
no
cause
would
come
up
whereby
Drouet
would
be
*NL*
led
to
inform
Carrie
concerning
his
married
state
,
he
felt
hopeful
.
*NL*
Things
were
going
so
smoothly
that
he
believed
they
would
not
change
.
*NL*
Shortly
now
he
would
persuade
Carrie
and
all
would
be
satisfactory
.

The
day
after
their

visit
he
began
writing
her
regularly
--
a
*NL*
letter
every
morning
,
and
begging
her
to
do
as
much
for
him
.
He
was
*NL*
not
literary
by
any
means
,
but
experience
of
the
world
and
his
growing
*NL*
affection
gave
him
somewhat
of
a
style
.
This
he
exercised
at
his
*NL*
office
desk
with
perfect
deliberation
.
He
purchased
a
box
of
delicately
*NL*
coloured
and
scented
writing
paper
in
monogram
,
which
he
kept
locked
*NL*
in
one
of
the
drawers
.
His
friends
now
wondered
at
the
cleric
and
very
*NL*
official-looking
nature
of
his
position
.
The
five
bartenders
viewed
with
*NL*
respect
the
duties
which
could
call
a
man
to
do
so
much
desk-work
and
*NL*
penmanship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
surprised
himself
with
his
fluency
.
By
the
natural
law
which
*NL*
governs
all
effort
,
what
he
wrote
reacted
upon
him
.
He
began
to
feel
*NL*
those
subtleties
which
he
could
find
words
to
express
.
With
every
*NL*
expression
came
increased
conception
.
Those
inmost
breathings
which
*NL*
there
found
words
took
hold
upon
him
.
He
thought
Carrie
worthy
of
all
*NL*
the
affection
he
could
there
express
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
indeed
worth
loving
if
ever
youth
and
grace
are
to
command
*NL*
that
token
of
acknowledgment
from
life
in
their
bloom
.
Experience
had
*NL*
not
yet
taken
away
that
freshness
of
the
spirit
which
is
the
charm
of
*NL*
the
body
.
Her
soft
eyes
contained
in
their
liquid
lustre
no
suggestion
*NL*
of
the
knowledge
of
disappointment
.
She
had
been
troubled
in
a
way
by
*NL*
doubt
and
longing
,
but
these
had
made
no
deeper
impression
than
could
be
*NL*
traced
in
a
certain
open
wistfulness
of
glance
and
speech
.
The
mouth
had
*NL*
the
expression
at
times
,
in
talking
and
in
repose
,
of
one
who
might
be
*NL*
upon
the
verge
of
tears
.
It
was
not
that
grief
was
thus
ever
present
.
*NL*
The
pronunciation
of
certain
syllables
gave
to
her
lips
this
peculiarity
*NL*
of
formation
--
a
formation
as
suggestive
and
moving
as
pathos
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
bold
in
her
manner
.
Life
had
not
taught
her
*NL*
domination
--
superciliousness
of
grace
,
which
is
the
lordly
power
of
some
*NL*
women
.
Her
longing
for
consideration
was
not
sufficiently
powerful
to
*NL*
move
her
to
demand
it
.
Even
now
she
lacked
self-assurance
,
but
there
was
*NL*
that
in
what
she
had
already
experienced
which
left
her
a
little
less
*NL*
than
timid
.
She
wanted
pleasure
,
she
wanted
position
,
and
yet
she
was
*NL*
confused
as
to
what
these
things
might
be
.
Every
hour
the
kaleidoscope
*NL*
of
human
affairs
threw
a
new
lustre
upon
something
,
and
therewith
it
*NL*
became
for
her
the
desired
--
the
all
.
Another
shift
of
the
box
,
and
some
*NL*
other
had
become
the
beautiful
,
the
perfect
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
spiritual
side
,
also
,
she
was
rich
in
feeling
,
as
such
a
nature
*NL*
well
might
be
.
Sorrow
in
her
was
aroused
by
many
a
spectacle
--
an
*NL*
uncritical
upwelling
of
grief
for
the
weak
and
the
helpless
.
She
was
*NL*
constantly
pained
by
the
sight
of
the
white-faced
,
ragged
men
who
*NL*
slopped
desperately
by
her
in
a
sort
of
wretched
mental
stupor
.
The
*NL*
poorly
clad
girls
who
went
blowing
by
her
window
evenings
,
hurrying
home
*NL*
from
some
of
the
shops
of
the
West
Side
,
she
pitied
from
the
depths
of
*NL*
her
heart
.
She
would
stand
and
bite
her
lips
as
they
passed
,
shaking
her
*NL*
little
head
and
wondering
.
They
had
so
little
,
she
thought
.
It
was
so
*NL*
sad
to
be
ragged
and
poor
.
The
hang
of
faded
clothes
pained
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
have
to
work
so
hard
!
''
was
her
only
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
street
sometimes
she
would
see
men
working
--
Irishmen
with
picks
,
*NL*
coal-heavers
with
great
loads
to
shovel
,
Americans
busy
about
some
work
*NL*
which
was
a
mere
matter
of
strength
--
and
they
touched
her
fancy
.
Toil
,
*NL*
now
that
she
was
free
of
it
,
seemed
even
a
more
desolate
thing
than
when
*NL*
she
was
part
of
it
.
She
saw
it
through
a
mist
of
fancy
--
a
pale
,
sombre
*NL*
half-light
,
which
was
the
essence
of
poetic
feeling
.
Her
old
father
,
*NL*
in
his
flour-dusted
miller
's
suit
,
sometimes
returned
to
her
in
memory
,
*NL*
revived
by
a
face
in
a
window
.
A
shoemaker
pegging
at
his
last
,
a
*NL*
blastman
seen
through
a
narrow
window
in
some
basement
where
iron
was
*NL*
being
melted
,
a
bench-worker
seen
high
aloft
in
some
window
,
his
coat
*NL*
off
,
his
sleeves
rolled
up
;
these
took
her
back
in
fancy
to
the
details
*NL*
of
the
mill
.
She
felt
,
though
she
seldom
expressed
them
,
sad
thoughts
*NL*
upon
this
score
.
Her
sympathies
were
ever
with
that
under-world
of
toil
*NL*
from
which
she
had
so
recently
sprung
,
and
which
she
best
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Hurstwood
did
not
know
it
,
he
was
dealing
with
one
whose
feelings
*NL*
were
as
tender
and
as
delicate
as
this
.
He
did
not
know
,
but
it
was
this
*NL*
in
her
,
after
all
,
which
attracted
him
.
He
never
attempted
to
analyse
*NL*
the
nature
of
his
affection
.
It
was
sufficient
that
there
was
tenderness
*NL*
in
her
eye
,
weakness
in
her
manner
,
good
nature
and
hope
in
her
*NL*
thoughts
.
He
drew
near
this
lily
,
which
had
sucked
its
waxen
beauty
and
*NL*
perfume
from
below
a
depth
of
waters
which
he
had
never
penetrated
,
*NL*
and
out
of
ooze
and
mould
which
he
could
not
understand
.
He
drew
near
*NL*
because
it
was
waxen
and
fresh
.
It
lightened
his
feelings
for
him
.
It
*NL*
made
the
morning
worth
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
material
way
,
she
was
considerably
improved
.
Her
awkwardness
had
*NL*
all
but
passed
,
leaving
,
if
anything
,
a
quaint
residue
which
was
as
*NL*
pleasing
as
perfect
grace
.
Her
little
shoes
now
fitted
her
smartly
*NL*
and
had
high
heels
.
She
had
learned
much
about
laces
and
those
little
*NL*
neckpieces
which
add
so
much
to
a
woman
's
appearance
.
Her
form
had
*NL*
filled
out
until
it
was
admirably
plump
and
well-rounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
wrote
her
one
morning
,
asking
her
to
meet
him
in
Jefferson
*NL*
Park
,
Monroe
Street
.
He
did
not
consider
it
policy
to
call
any
more
,
*NL*
even
when
Drouet
was
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
afternoon
he
was
in
the
pretty
little
park
by
one
,
and
had
*NL*
found
a
rustic
bench
beneath
the
green
leaves
of
a
lilac
bush
which
*NL*
bordered
one
of
the
paths
.
It
was
at
that
season
of
the
year
when
the
*NL*
fulness
of
spring
had
not
yet
worn
quite
away
.
At
a
little
pond
near
by
*NL*
some
cleanly
dressed
children
were
sailing
white
canvas
boats
.
In
the
*NL*
shade
of
a
green
pagoda
a
bebuttoned
officer
of
the
law
was
resting
,
his
*NL*
arms
folded
,
his
club
at
rest
in
his
belt
.
An
old
gardener
was
upon
the
*NL*
lawn
,
with
a
pair
of
pruning
shears
,
looking
after
some
bushes
.
High
*NL*
overhead
was
the
clean
blue
sky
of
the
new
summer
,
and
in
the
thickness
*NL*
of
the
shiny
green
leaves
of
the
trees
hopped
and
twittered
the
busy
*NL*
sparrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
had
come
out
of
his
own
home
that
morning
feeling
much
of
the
*NL*
same
old
annoyance
.
At
his
store
he
had
idled
,
there
being
no
need
to
*NL*
write
.
He
had
come
away
to
this
place
with
the
lightness
of
heart
which
*NL*
characterises
those
who
put
weariness
behind
.
Now
,
in
the
shade
of
this
*NL*
cool
,
green
bush
,
he
looked
about
him
with
the
fancy
of
the
lover
.
He
*NL*
heard
the
carts
go
lumbering
by
upon
the
neighbouring
streets
,
but
they
*NL*
were
far
off
,
and
only
buzzed
upon
his
ear
.
The
hum
of
the
surrounding
*NL*
city
was
faint
,
the
clang
of
an
occasional
bell
was
as
music
.
He
looked
*NL*
and
dreamed
a
new
dream
of
pleasure
which
concerned
his
present
fixed
*NL*
condition
not
at
all
.
He
got
back
in
fancy
to
the
old
Hurstwood
,
who
was
*NL*
neither
married
nor
fixed
in
a
solid
position
for
life
.
He
remembered
*NL*
the
light
spirit
in
which
he
once
looked
after
the
girls
--
how
he
had
*NL*
danced
,
escorted
them
home
,
hung
over
their
gates
.
He
almost
wished
he
*NL*
was
back
there
again
--
here
in
this
pleasant
scene
he
felt
as
if
he
were
*NL*
wholly
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
two
Carrie
came
tripping
along
the
walk
toward
him
,
rosy
and
clean
.
*NL*
She
had
just
recently
donned
a
sailor
hat
for
the
season
with
a
band
of
*NL*
pretty
white-dotted
blue
silk
.
Her
skirt
was
of
a
rich
blue
material
,
*NL*
and
her
shirt
waist
matched
it
,
with
a
thin-stripe
of
blue
upon
a
*NL*
snow-white
ground
--
stripes
that
were
as
fine
as
hairs
.
Her
brown
shoes
*NL*
peeped
occasionally
from
beneath
her
skirt
.
She
carried
her
gloves
in
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
looked
up
at
her
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
came
,
dearest
,
''
he
said
eagerly
,
standing
to
meet
her
and
taking
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
;
``
did
you
think
I
would
n't
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
forehead
,
which
was
moist
from
her
brisk
walk
.
Then
he
*NL*
took
out
one
of
his
own
soft
,
scented
silk
handkerchiefs
and
touched
her
*NL*
face
here
and
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
he
said
affectionately
,
``
you
're
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
happy
in
being
near
one
another
--
in
looking
into
each
other
's
*NL*
eyes
.
Finally
,
when
the
long
flush
of
delight
had
sub
sided
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
is
Charlie
going
away
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
answered
.
``
He
says
he
has
some
things
to
do
for
the
*NL*
house
here
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
grew
serious
,
and
he
lapsed
into
quiet
thought
.
He
looked
up
*NL*
after
a
time
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
away
and
leave
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
eyes
to
the
boys
with
the
boats
,
as
if
the
request
were
of
*NL*
little
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
would
we
go
?
''
she
asked
in
much
the
same
manner
,
rolling
her
*NL*
gloves
,
and
looking
into
a
neighbouring
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
want
to
go
?
''
he
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
in
the
tone
in
which
he
said
this
which
made
her
*NL*
feel
as
if
she
must
record
her
feelings
against
any
local
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ca
n't
stay
in
Chicago
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
thought
that
this
was
in
her
mind
--
that
any
removal
would
be
*NL*
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
he
asked
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
because
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
would
n't
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
to
this
with
but
dull
perception
of
what
it
meant
.
It
had
no
*NL*
serious
ring
to
it
.
The
question
was
not
up
for
immediate
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
have
to
give
up
my
position
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
he
used
made
it
seem
as
if
the
matter
deserved
only
slight
*NL*
consideration
.
Carrie
thought
a
little
,
the
while
enjoying
the
pretty
*NL*
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
like
to
live
in
Chicago
and
him
here
,
''
she
said
,
thinking
of
*NL*
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
big
town
,
dearest
,
''
Hurstwood
answered
.
``
It
would
be
as
good
as
*NL*
moving
to
another
part
of
the
country
to
move
to
the
South
Side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
fixed
upon
that
region
as
an
objective
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
I
should
n't
want
to
get
married
as
long
as
he
is
*NL*
here
.
I
would
n't
want
to
run
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
suggestion
of
marriage
struck
Hurstwood
forcibly
.
He
saw
clearly
*NL*
that
this
was
her
idea
--
he
felt
that
it
was
not
to
be
gotten
over
*NL*
easily
.
Bigamy
lightened
the
horizon
of
his
shadowy
thoughts
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
He
wondered
for
the
life
of
him
how
it
would
all
come
out
.
He
*NL*
could
not
see
that
he
was
making
any
progress
save
in
her
regard
.
When
*NL*
he
looked
at
her
now
,
he
thought
her
beautiful
.
What
a
thing
it
was
to
*NL*
have
her
love
him
,
even
if
it
be
entangling
!
She
increased
in
value
in
*NL*
his
eyes
because
of
her
objection
.
She
was
something
to
struggle
for
,
*NL*
and
that
was
everything
.
How
different
from
the
women
who
yielded
*NL*
willingly
!
He
swept
the
thought
of
them
from
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
do
n't
know
when
he
'll
go
away
?
''
asked
Hurstwood
,
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
determined
little
miss
,
are
n't
you
?
''
he
said
,
after
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
looking
up
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
a
wave
of
feeling
sweep
over
her
at
this
.
It
was
pride
at
*NL*
what
seemed
his
admiration
--
affection
for
the
man
who
could
feel
this
*NL*
concerning
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
coyly
,
``
but
what
can
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
folded
his
hands
and
looked
away
over
the
lawn
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
he
said
pathetically
,
``
you
would
come
to
me
.
I
do
n't
like
to
*NL*
be
away
from
you
this
way
.
What
good
is
there
in
waiting
?
You
're
not
any
*NL*
happier
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happier
!
''
she
exclaimed
softly
,
``
you
know
better
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
are
then
,
''
he
went
on
in
the
same
tone
,
``
wasting
our
days
.
If
*NL*
you
are
not
happy
,
do
you
think
I
am
?
I
sit
and
write
to
you
the
biggest
*NL*
part
of
the
time
.
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
Carrie
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
throwing
*NL*
sudden
force
of
expression
into
his
voice
and
fixing
her
with
his
eyes
,
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
live
without
you
,
and
that
's
all
there
is
to
it
.
Now
,
''
he
*NL*
concluded
,
showing
the
palm
of
one
of
his
white
hands
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
at-an-end
,
helpless
expression
,
``
what
shall
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
shifting
of
the
burden
to
her
appealed
to
Carrie
.
The
semblance
of
*NL*
the
load
without
the
weight
touched
the
woman
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
wait
a
little
while
yet
?
''
she
said
tenderly
.
``
I
'll
try
and
*NL*
find
out
when
he
's
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
good
will
it
do
?
''
he
asked
,
holding
the
same
strain
of
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
perhaps
we
can
arrange
to
go
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
really
did
not
see
anything
clearer
than
before
,
but
she
was
getting
*NL*
into
that
frame
of
mind
where
,
out
of
sympathy
,
a
woman
yields
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
did
not
understand
.
He
was
wondering
how
she
was
to
be
*NL*
persuaded
--
what
appeal
would
move
her
to
forsake
Drouet
.
He
began
to
*NL*
wonder
how
far
her
affection
for
him
would
carry
her
.
He
was
thinking
of
*NL*
some
question
which
would
make
her
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
he
hit
upon
one
of
those
problematical
propositions
which
often
*NL*
disguise
our
own
desires
while
leading
us
to
an
understanding
of
the
*NL*
difficulties
which
others
make
for
us
,
and
so
discover
for
us
a
way
.
It
*NL*
had
not
the
slightest
connection
with
anything
intended
on
his
part
,
and
*NL*
was
spoken
at
random
before
he
had
given
it
a
moment
's
serious
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
,
''
he
said
,
looking
into
her
face
and
assuming
a
serious
look
*NL*
which
he
did
not
feel
,
``
suppose
I
were
to
come
to
you
next
week
,
or
this
*NL*
week
for
that
matter
--
to-night
say
--
and
tell
you
I
had
to
go
away
--
that
*NL*
I
could
n't
stay
another
minute
and
was
n't
coming
back
any
more
--
would
*NL*
you
come
with
me
?
''
His
sweetheart
viewed
him
with
the
most
affectionate
*NL*
glance
,
her
answer
ready
before
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
stop
to
argue
or
arrange
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
you
could
n't
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
when
he
saw
that
she
took
him
seriously
,
and
he
thought
what
a
*NL*
chance
it
would
afford
for
a
possible
junket
of
a
week
or
two
.
He
had
*NL*
a
notion
to
tell
her
that
he
was
joking
and
so
brush
away
her
sweet
*NL*
seriousness
,
but
the
effect
of
it
was
too
delightful
.
He
let
it
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
we
did
n't
have
time
to
get
married
here
?
''
he
added
,
an
*NL*
afterthought
striking
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
got
married
as
soon
as
we
got
to
the
other
end
of
the
journey
it
*NL*
would
be
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
that
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
seemed
peculiarly
bright
to
him
now
.
He
wondered
whatever
*NL*
could
have
put
such
a
thought
into
his
head
.
Impossible
as
it
was
,
he
*NL*
could
not
help
smiling
at
its
cleverness
.
It
showed
how
she
loved
him
.
*NL*
There
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
now
,
and
he
would
find
a
way
to
win
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
jokingly
,
``
I
'll
come
and
get
you
one
of
these
*NL*
evenings
,
''
and
then
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
stay
with
you
,
though
,
if
you
did
n't
marry
me
,
''
Carrie
added
*NL*
reflectively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
,
''
he
said
tenderly
,
taking
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
extremely
happy
now
that
she
understood
.
She
loved
him
the
*NL*
more
for
thinking
that
he
would
rescue
her
so
.
As
for
him
,
the
marriage
*NL*
clause
did
not
dwell
in
his
mind
.
He
was
thinking
that
with
such
*NL*
affection
there
could
be
no
bar
to
his
eventual
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
stroll
about
,
''
he
said
gayly
,
rising
and
surveying
all
the
lovely
*NL*
park
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
the
young
Irishman
,
who
looked
after
them
with
envious
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
foine
couple
,
''
he
observed
to
himself
.
``
They
must
be
rich

Chapter

A
WITLESS
ALADDIN
--
THE
GATE
TO
THE
WORLD
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
his
present
stay
in
Chicago
,
Drouet
paid
some
slight
*NL*
attention
to
the
secret
order
to
which
he
belonged
.
During
his
last
trip
*NL*
he
had
received
a
new
light
on
its
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
''
said
another
drummer
to
him
,
``
it
's
a
great
thing
.
Look
at
*NL*
Hazenstab
.
He
is
n't
so
deuced
clever
.
Of
course
he
's
got
a
good
house
*NL*
behind
him
,
but
that
wo
n't
do
alone
.
I
tell
you
it
's
his
degree
.
He
's
*NL*
a
way-up
Mason
,
and
that
goes
a
long
way
.
He
's
got
a
secret
sign
that
*NL*
stands
for
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
resolved
then
and
there
that
he
would
take
more
interest
in
such
*NL*
matters
.
So
when
he
got
back
to
Chicago
he
repaired
to
his
local
lodge
*NL*
headquarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Drouet
,
''
said
Mr.
Harry
Quincel
,
an
individual
who
was
very
*NL*
prominent
in
this
local
branch
of
the
Elks
,
``
you
're
the
man
that
can
*NL*
help
us
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
the
business
meeting
and
things
were
going
socially
with
*NL*
a
hum
.
Drouet
was
bobbing
around
chatting
and
joking
with
a
score
of
*NL*
individuals
whom
he
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
up
to
?
''
he
inquired
genially
,
turning
a
smiling
face
upon
*NL*
his
secret
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
trying
to
get
up
some
theatricals
for
two
weeks
from
to-day
,
*NL*
and
we
want
to
know
if
you
do
n't
know
some
young
lady
who
could
take
a
*NL*
part
--
it
's
an
easy
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
said
Drouet
,
``
what
is
it
?
''
He
did
not
trouble
to
remember
*NL*
that
he
knew
no
one
to
whom
he
could
appeal
on
this
score
.
His
innate
*NL*
good-nature
,
however
,
dictated
a
favourable
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
we
are
trying
to
do
,
''
went
on
Mr.
*NL*
Quincel
.
``
We
are
trying
to
get
a
new
set
of
furniture
for
the
lodge
.
*NL*
There
is
n't
enough
money
in
the
treasury
at
the
present
time
,
and
we
*NL*
thought
we
would
raise
it
by
a
little
entertainment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
interrupted
Drouet
,
``
that
's
a
good
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Several
of
the
boys
around
here
have
got
talent
.
There
's
Harry
*NL*
Burbeck
,
he
does
a
fine
black-face
turn
.
Mac
Lewis
is
all
right
at
heavy
*NL*
dramatics
.
Did
you
ever
hear
him
recite
`
Over
the
Hills
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
tell
you
,
he
does
it
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
want
me
to
get
some
woman
to
take
a
part
?
''
questioned
Drouet
,
*NL*
anxious
to
terminate
the
subject
and
get
on
to
something
else
.
``
What
are
*NL*
you
going
to
play
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Under
the
Gaslight
,
'
''
said
Mr.
Quincel
,
mentioning
Augustin
Daly
's
*NL*
famous
production
,
which
had
worn
from
a
great
public
success
down
to
an
*NL*
amateur
theatrical
favourite
,
with
many
of
the
troublesome
accessories
*NL*
cut
out
and
the
dramatis
personae
reduced
to
the
smallest
possible
*NL*
number
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
had
seen
this
play
some
time
in
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
''
he
said
;
``
that
's
a
fine
play
.
It
will
go
all
right
.
You
*NL*
ought
to
make
a
lot
of
money
out
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
think
we
'll
do
very
well
,
''
Mr.
Quincel
replied
.
``
Do
n't
you
forget
*NL*
now
,
''
he
concluded
,
Drouet
showing
signs
of
restlessness
;
``
some
young
*NL*
woman
to
take
the
part
of
Laura
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
I
'll
attend
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
away
,
forgetting
almost
all
about
it
the
moment
Mr.
Quincel
had
*NL*
ceased
talking
.
He
had
not
even
thought
to
ask
the
time
or
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
was
reminded
of
his
promise
a
day
or
two
later
by
the
receipt
of
*NL*
a
letter
announcing
that
the
first
rehearsal
was
set
for
the
following
*NL*
Friday
evening
,
and
urging
him
to
kindly
forward
the
young
lady
's
*NL*
address
at
once
,
in
order
that
the
part
might
be
delivered
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
who
the
deuce
do
I
know
?
''
asked
the
drummer
reflectively
,
*NL*
scratching
his
rosy
ear
.
``
I
do
n't
know
any
one
that
knows
anything
about
*NL*
amateur
theatricals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
over
in
memory
the
names
of
a
number
of
women
he
knew
,
and
*NL*
finally
fixed
on
one
,
largely
because
of
the
convenient
location
of
her
*NL*
home
on
the
West
Side
,
and
promised
himself
that
as
he
came
out
that
*NL*
evening
he
would
see
her
.
When
,
however
,
he
started
west
on
the
car
*NL*
he
forgot
,
and
was
only
reminded
of
his
delinquency
by
an
item
in
the
*NL*
``
Evening
News
''
--
a
small
three-line
affair
under
the
head
of
Secret
*NL*
Society
Notes
--
which
stated
the
Custer
Lodge
of
the
Order
of
Elks
would
*NL*
give
a
theatrical
performance
in
Avery
Hall
on
the
16th
,
when
``
Under
the
*NL*
Gaslight
''
would
be
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
!
''
exclaimed
Drouet
,
``
I
forgot
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
inquired
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
at
their
little
table
in
the
room
which
might
have
been
used
*NL*
for
a
kitchen
,
where
Carrie
occasionally
served
a
meal
.
To-night
the
*NL*
fancy
had
caught
her
,
and
the
little
table
was
spread
with
a
pleasing
*NL*
repast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
lodge
entertainment
.
They
're
going
to
give
a
play
,
and
they
*NL*
wanted
me
to
get
them
some
young
lady
to
take
a
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
they
're
going
to
play
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Under
the
Gaslight
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
16th
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
do
n't
you
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
any
one
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
he
said
,
``
how
would
you
like
to
take
the
part
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
ca
n't
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
questioned
Drouet
reflectively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
answered
Carrie
,
``
I
never
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
she
was
pleased
to
think
he
would
ask
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
brightened
,
for
if
there
was
anything
that
enlisted
her
sympathies
it
*NL*
was
the
art
of
the
stage
.
True
to
his
nature
,
Drouet
clung
to
this
idea
*NL*
as
an
easy
way
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nothing
.
You
can
act
all
you
have
to
down
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
weakly
,
very
much
drawn
toward
the
*NL*
proposition
and
yet
fearful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
can
.
Now
,
why
do
n't
you
do
it
?
They
need
some
one
,
and
it
will
*NL*
be
lots
of
fun
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
it
wo
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
like
that
.
I
know
you
would
.
I
've
seen
you
dancing
around
here
*NL*
and
giving
imitations
and
that
's
why
I
asked
you
.
You
're
clever
enough
,
*NL*
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not

said
Carrie
shyly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
do

You
go
down
and
see
about
it
.
It
'll
be
*NL*
fun
for
you
.
The
rest
of
the
company
is
n't
going
to
be
any
good
.
They
*NL*
have
n't
any
experience
.
What
do
they
know
about
theatricals
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
as
he
thought
of
their
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hand
me
the
coffee

it
when

I
asked

*NL*
*NL*

What
is
the

did
you
say

Under

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
part
would
they
want
me
to
take
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
one
of

heroines

I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
a
play
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Drouet
,
whose
memory
for
such
things
was
not
the
best
,
*NL*
``
it
's
about
a
girl
who
gets
kidnapped
by
a
couple
of
crooks
--
a
man
and
*NL*
a
woman
that
live
in
the
slums
.
She
had
some
money
or
something
and
they
*NL*
wanted
to
get
it
.
I
do
n't
know
now
how
it
did
go
exactly
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
know
what
part
I
would
have
to
take
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
,
to
tell
the
truth

''
He
thought
a
moment
.
``
Yes
,
I
do
,
too
.
*NL*
Laura
,
that
's
the
thing
--
you
're
to
be
Laura
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
ca
n't
remember
what
the
part
is
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
save
me

Cad

I
ca
n't
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
ought
to
,
too
;
I
've
seen
*NL*
the
play
enough
.
There
's
a
girl
in
it
that
was
stolen
when
she
was
an
*NL*
infant
--
was
picked
off
the
street
or
something
--
and
she
's
the
one
that
's
*NL*
hounded
by
the
two
old
criminals
I
was
telling
you
about
.
''
He
stopped
*NL*
with
a
mouthful
of
pie
poised
on
a
fork
before
his
face
.
``
She
comes
very
*NL*
near
getting
drowned
--
no
,
that
's
not
it
.
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
,
''
he
*NL*
concluded
hopelessly
,
``
I
'll
get
you
the
book
.
I
ca
n't
remember
now
for
*NL*
the
life
of
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't

''
said
Carrie
,
when
he
had
concluded
,
her
interest
*NL*
and
desire
to
shine
dramatically
struggling
with
her
timidity
for
the
*NL*
mastery
.
``
I
might
go
if
you
thought
I
'd
do
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
you
'll
do
,
''
said
Drouet
,
who
,
in
his
efforts
to
enthuse
*NL*
Carrie
,
had
interested
himself
.
``
Do
you
think
I
'd
come
home
here
and
*NL*
urge
you
to
do
something
that
I
did

you
would
make
a
success
*NL*
of
?
You
can
act
all
right
.
It
'll
be
good
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
must
I
go
?
''
said
Carrie
,
reflectively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
rehearsal
is
Friday
night
.
I
'll
get
the
part
for
you
*NL*
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Carrie
resignedly
,
``
I
'll
do
it
,
but
if
I
make
a
*NL*
failure
now
it
's
your
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
fail
,
''
assured
Drouet
.
``
Just
act
as
you
do
around
here
.
Be
*NL*
natural
.
You
're
all
right
.
I
've
often
thought
you
'd
make
a
corking
good
*NL*
actress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
really
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
said
the
drummer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
little
knew
as
he
went
out
of
the
door
that
night
what
a
secret
*NL*
flame
he
had
kindled
in
the
bosom
of
the
girl
he
left
behind
.
Carrie
was
*NL*
possessed
of
that
sympathetic
,
impressionable
nature
which
,
ever
in
the
*NL*
most
developed
form
,
has
been
the
glory
of
the
drama
.
She
was
created
*NL*
with
that
passivity
of
soul
which
is
always
the
mirror
of
the
active
*NL*
world
.
She
possessed
an
innate
taste
for
imitation
and
no
small
ability
.
*NL*
Even
without
practice
,
she
could
sometimes
restore
dramatic
situations
*NL*
she
had
witnessed
by
re-creating
,
before
her
mirror
,
the
expressions
of
*NL*
the
various
faces
taking
part
in
the
scene
.
She
loved
to
modulate
her
*NL*
voice
after
the
conventional
manner
of
the
distressed
heroine
,
and
*NL*
repeat
such
pathetic
fragments
as
appealed
most
to
her
sympathies
.
Of
*NL*
late
,
seeing
the
airy
grace
of
the
ingenue
in
several
well-constructed
*NL*
plays
,
she
had
been
moved
to
secretly
imitate
it
,
and
many
were
the
*NL*
little
movements
and
expressions
of
the
body
in
which
she
indulged
from
*NL*
time
to
time
in
the
privacy
of
her
chamber
.
On
several
occasions
,
when
*NL*
Drouet
had
caught
her
admiring
herself
,
as
he
imagined
,
in
the
mirror
,
*NL*
she
was
doing
nothing
more
than
recalling
some
little
grace
of
the
*NL*
mouth
or
the
eyes
which
she
had
witnessed
in
another
.
Under
his
airy
*NL*
accusation
she
mistook
this
for
vanity
and
accepted
the
blame
with
a
*NL*
faint
sense
of
error
,
though
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
it
was
nothing
more
*NL*
than
the
first
subtle
outcroppings
of
an
artistic
nature
,
endeavouring
*NL*
to
re-create
the
perfect
likeness
of
some
phase
of
beauty
which
appealed
*NL*
to
her
.
In
such
feeble
tendencies
,
be
it
known
,
such
outworking
of
*NL*
desire
to
reproduce
life
,
lies
the
basis
of
all
dramatic
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
when
Carrie
heard
Drouet
's
laudatory
opinion
of
her
dramatic
*NL*
ability
,
her
body
tingled
with
satisfaction
.
Like
the
flame
which
*NL*
welds
the
loosened
particles
into
a
solid
mass
,
his
words
united
those
*NL*
floating
wisps
of
feeling
which
she
had
felt
,
but
never
believed
,
*NL*
concerning
her
possible
ability
,
and
made
them
into
a
gaudy
shred
of
*NL*
hope
.
Like
all
human
beings
,
she
had
a
touch
of
vanity
.
She
felt
that
*NL*
she
could
do
things
if
she
only
had
a
chance
.
How
often
had
she
looked
*NL*
at
the
well-dressed
actresses
on
the
stage
and
wondered
how
she
would
*NL*
look
,
how
delightful
she
would
feel
if
only
she
were
in
their
place
.
The
*NL*
glamour
,
the
tense
situation
,
the
fine
clothes
,
the
applause
,
these
had
*NL*
lured
her
until
she
felt
that
she
,
too
,
could
act
--
that
she
,
too
,
*NL*
could
compel
acknowledgment
of
power
.
Now
she
was
told
that
she
really
*NL*
could
--
that
little
things
she
had
done
about
the
house
had
made
even
him
*NL*
feel
her
power
.
It
was
a
delightful
sensation
while
it
lasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Drouet
was
gone
,
she
sat
down
in
her
rocking-chair
by
the
window
to
*NL*
think
about
it
.
As
usual
,
imagination
exaggerated
the
possibilities
*NL*
for
her
.
It
was
as
if
he
had
put
fifty
cents
in
her
hand
and
she
had
*NL*
exercised
the
thoughts
of
a
thousand
dollars
.
She
saw
herself
in
a
*NL*
score
of
pathetic
situations
in
which
she
assumed
a
tremulous
voice
and
*NL*
suffering
manner
.
Her
mind
delighted
itself
with
scenes
of
luxury
and
*NL*
refinement
,
situations
in
which
she
was
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
,
the
*NL*
arbiter
of
all
fates
.
As
she
rocked
to
and
fro
she
felt
the
tensity
*NL*
of
woe
in
abandonment
,
the
magnificence
of
wrath
after
deception
,
the
*NL*
languour
of
sorrow
after
defeat
.
Thoughts
of
all
the
charming
women
she
*NL*
had
seen
in
plays
--
every
fancy
,
every
illusion
which
she
had
concerning
*NL*
the
stage
--
now
came
back
as
a
returning
tide
after
the
ebb
.
She
built
up
*NL*
feelings
and
a
determination
which
the
occasion
did
not
warrant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
dropped
in
at
the
lodge
when
he
went
down
town
,
and
swashed
*NL*
around
with
a
great
AIR
,
as
Quincel
met
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
that
young
lady
you
were
going
to
get
for
us
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
her
,
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
?
''
said
Quincel
,
rather
surprised
by
his
promptness
;
``
that
's
*NL*
good
.
What
's
her
address
?
''
and
he
pulled
out
his
notebook
in
order
to
be
*NL*
able
to
send
her
part
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
send
her
her
part
?
''
asked
the
drummer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
take
it
.
I
'm
going
right
by
her
house
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
her
address
was
?
We
only
want
it
in
case
we
have
any
*NL*
information
to
send
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-nine
Ogden
Place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
her
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
Madenda
,
''
said
the
drummer
,
firing
at
random
.
The
lodge
members
*NL*
knew
him
to
be
single
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
sounds
like
somebody
that
can
act
,
does
n't
it
?
''
said
Quincel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
part
home
to
Carrie
and
handed
it
to
her
with
the
manner
of
*NL*
one
who
does
a
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
that
's
the
best
part
.
Do
you
think
you
can
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
until
I
look
it
over
.
You
know
I
'm
afraid
,
now
that
I
've
*NL*
said
I
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
go
on
.
What
have
you
got
to
be
afraid
of
?
It
's
a
cheap
company
.
The
*NL*
rest
of
them
are
n't
as
good
as
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
see
,
''
said
Carrie
,
pleased
to
have
the
part
,
for
all
her
*NL*
misgivings
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sidled
around
,
dressing
and
fidgeting
before
he
arranged
to
make
his
*NL*
next
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
getting
ready
to
print
the
programmes
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
gave
*NL*
them
the
name
of
Carrie
Madenda
.
Was
that
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
guess
so
,
''
said
his
companion
,
looking
up
at
him
.
She
was
*NL*
thinking
it
was
slightly
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
did
n't
make
a
hit
,
you
know
,
''
he
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
she
answered
,
rather
pleased
now
with
his
caution
.
It
was
*NL*
clever
for
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
want
to
introduce
you
as
my
wife
,
because
you
'd
feel
worse
*NL*
then
if
you
did
n't
GO
.
They
all
know
me
so
well
.
But
you
'll
GO
all
*NL*
right
.
Anyhow
,
you
'll
probably
never
meet
any
of
them
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
care
,
''
said
Carrie
desperately
.
She
was
determined
now
to
*NL*
have
a
try
at
the
fascinating
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
.
He
had
been
afraid
that
he
was
about
*NL*
to
precipitate
another
conversation
upon
the
marriage
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
part
of
Laura
,
as
Carrie
found
out
when
she
began
to
examine
it
,
was
*NL*
one
of
suffering
and
tears
.
As
delineated
by
Mr.
Daly
,
it
was
true
to
*NL*
the
most
sacred
traditions
of
melodrama
as
he
found
it
when
he
began
*NL*
his
career
.
The
sorrowful
demeanour
,
the
tremolo
music
,
the
long
,
*NL*
explanatory
,
cumulative
addresses
,
all
were
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
,
''
read
Carrie
,
consulting
the
text
and
drawing
her
voice
*NL*
out
pathetically
.
``
Martin
,
be
sure
and
give
him
a
glass
of
wine
before
*NL*
he
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
surprised
at
the
briefness
of
the
entire
part
,
not
knowing
that
*NL*
she
must
be
on
the
stage
while
others
were
talking
,
and
not
only
be
*NL*
there
,
but
also
keep
herself
in
harmony
with
the
dramatic
movement
of
*NL*
the
scenes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
can
do
that
,
though
,
''
she
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Drouet
came
the
next
night
,
she
was
very
much
satisfied
with
her
*NL*
day
's
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
goes
it
,
Caddie
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
she
laughed
.
``
I
think
I
have
it
memorised
nearly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good
,
''
he
said
.
``
Let
's
hear
some
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
can
get
up
and
say
it
off
here
,
''
she
said
*NL*
bashfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
why
you
should
n't
.
It
'll
be
easier
here
than
it
will
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
that
,
''
she
answered
.
Eventually
she
took
off
the
*NL*
ballroom
episode
with
considerable
feeling
,
forgetting
,
as
she
got
*NL*
deeper
in
the
scene
,
all
about
Drouet
,
and
letting
herself
rise
to
a
*NL*
fine
state
of
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
Drouet
;
``
fine
,
out
o
'
sight
!
You
're
all
right
Caddie
,
I
*NL*
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
really
moved
by
her
excellent
representation
and
the
general
*NL*
appearance
of
the
pathetic
little
figure
as
it
swayed
and
finally
*NL*
fainted
to
the
floor
.
He
had
bounded
up
to
catch
her
,
and
now
held
her
*NL*
laughing
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
you
afraid
you
'll
hurt
yourself
?
''
he
asked

A
GLIMPSE
THROUGH
THE
GATEWAY
--
HOPE
LIGHTENS
THE
EYE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
,
to
Carrie
,
very
important
theatrical
performance
was
to
take
place
*NL*
at
the
Avery
on
conditions
which
were
to
make
it
more
noteworthy
than
*NL*
was
at
first
anticipated
.
The
little
dramatic
student
had
written
to
*NL*
Hurstwood
the
very
morning
her
part
was
brought
her
that
she
was
going
*NL*
to
take
part
in
a
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
am
,
''
she
wrote
,
feeling
that
he
might
take
it
as
a
jest
;
``
I
*NL*
have
my
part
now
,
honest
,
truly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
smiled
in
an
indulgent
way
as
he
read
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
what
it
is
going
to
be
?
I
must
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
at
once
,
making
a
pleasant
reference
to
her
ability
.
``
I
*NL*
have
n't
the
slightest
doubt
you
will
make
a
success
.
You
must
come
to
*NL*
the
park
to-morrow
morning
and
tell
me
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
gladly
complied
,
and
revealed
all
the
details
of
the
undertaking
*NL*
as
she
understood
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
's
fine
.
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
.
Of
course
,
you
will
*NL*
do
well
,
you
're
so
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
truly
never
seen
so
much
spirit
in
the
girl
before
.
Her
tendency
*NL*
to
discover
a
touch
of
sadness
had
for
the
nonce
disappeared
.
As
she
*NL*
spoke
her
eyes
were
bright
,
her
cheeks
red
.
She
radiated
much
of
the
*NL*
pleasure
which
her
undertakings
gave
her
.
For
all
her
misgivings
--
and
*NL*
they
were
as
plentiful
as
the
moments
of
the
day
--
she
was
still
happy
.
*NL*
She
could
not
repress
her
delight
in
doing
this
little
thing
which
,
to
*NL*
an
ordinary
observer
,
had
no
importance
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
charmed
by
the
development
of
the
fact
that
the
girl
had
*NL*
capabilities
.
There
is
nothing
so
inspiring
in
life
as
the
sight
of
a
*NL*
legitimate
ambition
,
no
matter
how
incipient
.
It
gives
colour
,
force
,
*NL*
and
beauty
to
the
possessor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
now
lightened
by
a
touch
of
this
divine
afflatus
.
She
drew
*NL*
to
herself
commendation
from
her
two
admirers
which
she
had
not
earned
.
*NL*
Their
affection
for
her
naturally
heightened
their
perception
of
*NL*
what
she
was
trying
to
do
and
their
approval
of
what
she
did
.
Her
*NL*
inexperience
conserved
her
own
exuberant
fancy
,
which
ran
riot
with
*NL*
every
straw
of
opportunity
,
making
of
it
a
golden
divining
rod
whereby
*NL*
the
treasure
of
life
was
to
be
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
see
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
``
I
ought
to
know
some
of
the
boys
in
the
*NL*
lodge
.
I
'm
an
Elk
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
must
n't
let
him
know
I
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
,
''
said
the
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
for
you
to
be
there
,
if
you
want
to
come
,
but
I
do
n't
see
how
*NL*
you
can
unless
he
asks
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
there
,
''
said
Hurstwood
affectionately
.
``
I
can
fix
it
so
he
*NL*
wo
n't
know
you
told
me
.
You
leave
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
interest
of
the
manager
was
a
large
thing
in
itself
for
the
*NL*
performance
,
for
his
standing
among
the
Elks
was
something
worth
talking
*NL*
about
.
Already
he
was
thinking
of
a
box
with
some
friends
,
and
flowers
*NL*
for
Carrie
.
He
would
make
it
a
dress-suit
affair
and
give
the
little
*NL*
girl
a
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
day
or
two
,
Drouet
dropped
into
the
Adams
Street
resort
,
and
he
*NL*
was
at
once
spied
by
Hurstwood
.
It
was
at
five
in
the
afternoon
and
*NL*
the
place
was
crowded
with
merchants
,
actors
,
managers
,
politicians
,
a
*NL*
goodly
company
of
rotund
,
rosy
figures
,
silk-hatted
,
starchy-bosomed
,
*NL*
beringed
and
bescarfpinned
to
the
queen
's
taste
.
John
L.
Sullivan
,
the
*NL*
pugilist
,
was
at
one
end
of
the
glittering
bar
,
surrounded
by
a
company
*NL*
of
loudly
dressed
sports
,
who
were
holding
a
most
animated
conversation
.
*NL*
Drouet
came
across
the
floor
with
a
festive
stride
,
a
new
pair
of
tan
*NL*
shoes
squeaking
audibly
at
his
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
``
I
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
.
I
*NL*
thought
you
had
gone
out
of
town
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
report
more
regularly
we
'll
have
to
cut
you
off
the
list
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
help
it
,
''
said
the
drummer
,
``
I
've
been
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
strolled
over
toward
the
bar
amid
the
noisy
,
shifting
company
of
*NL*
notables
.
The
dressy
manager
was
shaken
by
the
hand
three
times
in
as
*NL*
many
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
your
lodge
is
going
to
give
a
performance
,
''
observed
Hurstwood
,
*NL*
in
the
most
offhand
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
who
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
They
just
sent
me
a
couple
of
tickets
,
which
*NL*
I
can
have
for
two
dollars
.
Is
it
going
to
be
any
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
replied
the
drummer
.
``
They
've
been
trying
to
get
me
to
*NL*
get
some
woman
to
take
a
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
n't
intending
to
go
,
''
said
the
manager
easily
.
``
I
'll
subscribe
,
of
*NL*
course
.
How
are
things
over
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
They
're
going
to
fit
things
up
out
of
the
proceeds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
manager
,
``
I
hope
they
make
a
success
of
it
.
Have
*NL*
another
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
intend
to
say
any
more
.
Now
,
if
he
should
appear
on
the
scene
*NL*
with
a
few
friends
,
he
could
say
that
he
had
been
urged
to
come
along
.
*NL*
Drouet
had
a
desire
to
wipe
out
the
possibility
of
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
the
girl
is
going
to
take
a
part
in
it
,
''
he
said
abruptly
,
*NL*
after
thinking
it
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
!
How
did
that
happen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
were
short
and
wanted
me
to
find
them
some
one
.
I
told
*NL*
Carrie
,
and
she
seems
to
want
to
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
for
her
,
''
said
the
manager
.
``
It
'll
be
a
real
nice
affair
.
Do
her
*NL*
good
,
too
.
Has
she
ever
had
any
experience
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
it
is
n't
anything
very
serious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
clever
,
though
,
''
said
Drouet
,
casting
off
any
imputation
against
*NL*
Carrie
's
ability
.
``
She
picks
up
her
part
quick
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
!
''
said
the
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
she
surprised
me
the
other
night
.
By
George
,
if
she
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
give
her
a
nice
little
send-off
,
''
said
the
manager
.
``
I
'll
look
*NL*
after
the
flowers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
smiled
at
his
good-nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
the
show
you
must
come
with
me
and
we
'll
have
a
little
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
'll
do
all
right
,
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
her
.
She
's
got
to
do
all
right
.
We
'll
make
her
,
''
and
the
*NL*
manager
gave
one
of
his
quick
,
steely
half-smiles
,
which
was
a
compound
*NL*
of
good-nature
and
shrewdness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
,
meanwhile
,
attended
the
first
rehearsal
.
At
this
performance
*NL*
Mr.
Quincel
presided
,
aided
by
Mr.
Millice
,
a
young
man
who
had
some
*NL*
qualifications
of
past
experience
,
which
were
not
exactly
understood
by
*NL*
any
one
.
He
was
so
experienced
and
so
business-like
,
however
,
that
he
*NL*
came
very
near
being
rude
--
failing
to
remember
,
as
he
did
,
that
the
*NL*
individuals
he
was
trying
to
instruct
were
volunteer
players
and
not
*NL*
salaried
underlings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Miss
Madenda
,
''
he
said
,
addressing
Carrie
,
who
stood
in
one
part
*NL*
uncertain
as
to
what
move
to
make
,
``
you
do
n't
want
to
stand
like
*NL*
that
.
Put
expression
in
your
face
.
Remember
,
you
are
troubled
over
the
*NL*
intrusion
of
the
stranger
.
Walk
so
,
''
and
he
struck
out
across
the
Avery
*NL*
stage
in
almost
drooping
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
did
not
exactly
fancy
the
suggestion
,
but
the
novelty
of
the
*NL*
situation
,
the
presence
of
strangers
,
all
more
or
less
nervous
,
and
the
*NL*
desire
to
do
anything
rather
than
make
a
failure
,
made
her
timid
.
She
*NL*
walked
in
imitation
of
her
mentor
as
requested
,
inwardly
feeling
that
*NL*
there
was
something
strangely
lacking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mrs.
Morgan
,
''
said
the
director
to
one
young
married
woman
who
was
*NL*
to
take
the
part
of
Pearl
,
``
you
sit
here
.
Now
,
Mr.
Bamberger
,
you
stand
*NL*
here
,
so
.
Now
,
what
is
it
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
,
''
said
Mr.
Bamberger
feebly
.
He
had
the
part
of
Ray
,
Laura
's
*NL*
lover
,
the
society
individual
who
was
to
waver
in
his
thoughts
of
*NL*
marrying
her
,
upon
finding
that
she
was
a
waif
and
a
nobody
by
birth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
--
what
does
your
text
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
,
''
repeated
Mr.
Bamberger
,
looking
intently
at
his
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
it
also
says
,
''
the
director
remarked
,
``
that
you
are
to
look
*NL*
shocked
.
Now
,
say
it
again
,
and
see
if
you
ca
n't
look
shocked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
!
''
demanded
Mr.
Bamberger
vigorously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
that
wo
n't
do
!
Say
it
this
way
--
EXPLAIN
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Explain
,
''
said
Mr.
Bamberger
,
giving
a
modified
imitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
better
.
Now
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
night
,
''
resumed
Mrs.
Morgan
,
whose
lines
came
next
,
``
father
and
*NL*
mother
were
going
to
the
opera

When
they
were
crossing
Broadway
,
the
*NL*
usual
crowd
of
children
accosted
them
for
alms
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
,
''
said
the
director
,
rushing
forward
,
his
arm
extended
.
``
Put
*NL*
more
feeling
into
what
you
are
saying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morgan
looked
at
him
as
if
she
feared
a
personal
assault
.
Her
eye
*NL*
lightened
with
resentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
,
Mrs.
Morgan
,
''
he
added
,
ignoring
the
gleam
,
but
modifying
his
*NL*
manner
,
``
that
you
're
detailing
a
pathetic
story
.
You
are
now
supposed
*NL*
to
be
telling
something
that
is
a
grief
to
you

It
requires
feeling

*NL*
repression

thus
:

The
usual
crowd
of
children
accosted
them
for
alms

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morgan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
mother
felt
in
her
pocket
for
some
change
,
her
fingers
touched
a
*NL*
cold
and
trembling
hand
which
had
clutched
her
purse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good

interrupted
the
director
,
nodding
his
head
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

Well

exclaimed
Mr.

speaking
the

here
fell
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

the

approaching
,
``
not

That
's
the
idea

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

said
Carrie
weakly

noticing
that
it
had
not
been
*NL*
proved
yet
whether
the
members
of
the
company
knew
their
lines

alone
the
details
of
expression

``
that
it

went
through

might
pick
up
*NL*
some
points

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
good
idea

Miss
Madenda

said
Mr.
Quincel
,
who
sat
at
the
side
*NL*
of
the
stage
,
looking
serenely
on
and
volunteering
opinions
which
the
*NL*
director
did
not
heed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,

said
the
latter
,
somewhat
abashed
,
``
it
might
be
well
to
do

it

Then
brightening
,
with
a
show
of
authority
,
``
Suppose
we
run
right
*NL*
through
,
putting
in
as
much
expression
as
we
can

``

Mr.

This
hand

''
resumed
Mrs.
Morgan
,
glancing
up
at
Mr.
Bamberger
and
down
*NL*
at
her
book
,
as
the
lines
proceeded
,
``
my
mother
grasped
in
her
own
,
*NL*
and
so
tight
that
a
small
,
feeble
voice
uttered
an
exclamation
of
pain
.
*NL*
Mother
looked
down
,
and
there
beside
her
was
a
little
ragged
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
observed
the
director
,
now
hopelessly
idle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thief
!
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Bamberger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Louder
,
''
put
in
the
director
,
finding
it
almost
impossible
to
keep
his
*NL*
hands
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thief
!
''
roared
poor
Bamberger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
a
thief
hardly
six
years
old
,
with
a
face
like
an
angel
's
.
*NL*
`
Stop
,
'
said
my
mother
.
`
What
are
you
doing
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Trying
to
steal
,
'
said
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Do
n't
you
know
that
it
is
wicked
to
do
so
?
'
asked
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
No
,
'
said
the
girl
,
`
but
it
is
dreadful
to
be
hungry
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Who
told
you
to
steal
?
'
asked
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
She
--
there
,
'
said
the
child
,
pointing
to
a
squalid
woman
in
a
doorway
*NL*
opposite
,
who
fled
suddenly
down
the
street
.
`
That
is
old
Judas
,
'
said
*NL*
the
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morgan
read
this
rather
flatly
,
and
the
director
was
in
despair
.
He
*NL*
fidgeted
around
,
and
then
went
over
to
Mr.
Quincel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
them
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
guess
we
'll
be
able
to
whip
them
into
shape
,
''
said
the
latter
,
*NL*
with
an
air
of
strength
under
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
the
director
.
``
That
fellow
Bamberger
strikes
me
as
*NL*
being
a
pretty
poor
shift
for
a
lover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
all
we
've
got
,
''
said
Quincel
,
rolling
up
his
eyes
.
``
Harrison
went
*NL*
back
on
me
at
the
last
minute
.
Who
else
can
we
get
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
the
director
.
``
I
'm
afraid
he
'll
never
pick
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Bamberger
was
exclaiming
,
``
Pearl
,
you
are
joking
with
*NL*
me
.
''
``
Look
at
that
now
,
''
said
the
director
,
whispering
behind
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
My
Lord
!
what
can
you
do
with
a
man
who
drawls
out
a
sentence
like
*NL*
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
the
best
you
can
,
''
said
Quincel
consolingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rendition
ran
on
in
this
wise
until
it
came
to
where
Carrie
,
as
*NL*
Laura
,
comes
into
the
room
to
explain
to
Ray
,
who
,
after
hearing
Pearl
's
*NL*
statement
about
her
birth
,
had
written
the
letter
repudiating
her
,
*NL*
which
,
however
,
he
did
not
deliver
.
Bamberger
was
just
concluding
the
*NL*
words
of
Ray
,
``
I
must
go
before
she
returns
.
Her
step
!
Too
late
,
''
and
*NL*
was
cramming
the
letter
in
his
pocket
,
when
she
began
sweetly
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ray
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
--
Miss
Courtland
,
''
Bamberger
faltered
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
a
moment
and
forgot
all
about
the
company
present
.
*NL*
She
began
to
feel
the
part
,
and
summoned
an
indifferent
smile
to
her
*NL*
lips
,
turning
as
the
lines
directed
and
going
to
a
window
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
not
present
.
She
did
it
with
a
grace
which
was
fascinating
to
look
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
woman
?
''
asked
the
director
,
watching
Carrie
in
her
little
*NL*
scene
with
Bamberger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Madenda
,
''
said
Quincel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
her
name
,
''
said
the
director
,
``
but
what
does
she
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Quincel
.
``
She
's
a
friend
of
one
of
our
members
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
's
got
more
gumption
than
any
one
I
've
seen
here
so
far
--
seems
*NL*
to
take
an
interest
in
what
she
's
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
,
too
,
is
n't
she
?
''
said
Quincel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
director
strolled
away
without
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
scene
,
where
she
was
supposed
to
face
the
company
in
the
*NL*
ball-room
,
she
did
even
better
,
winning
the
smile
of
the
director
,
who
*NL*
volunteered
,
because
of
her
fascination
for
him
,
to
come
over
and
speak
*NL*
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
ever
on
the
stage
?
''
he
asked
insinuatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
so
well
,
I
thought
you
might
have
had
some
experience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
only
smiled
consciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
away
to
listen
to
Bamberger
,
who
was
feebly
spouting
some
*NL*
ardent
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morgan
saw
the
drift
of
things
and
gleamed
at
Carrie
with
envious
*NL*
and
snapping
black
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
some
cheap
professional
,
''
she
gave
herself
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
thinking
,
and
scorned
and
hated
her
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rehearsal
ended
for
one
day
,
and
Carrie
went
home
feeling
that
she
*NL*
had
acquitted
herself
satisfactorily
.
The
words
of
the
director
*NL*
were
ringing
in
her
ears
,
and
she
longed
for
an
opportunity
to
tell
*NL*
Hurstwood
.
She
wanted
him
to
know
just
how
well
she
was
doing
.
Drouet
,
*NL*
too
,
was
an
object
for
her
confidences
.
She
could
hardly
wait
until
he
*NL*
should
ask
her
,
and
yet
she
did
not
have
the
vanity
to
bring
it
up
.
The
*NL*
drummer
,
however
,
had
another
line
of
thought
to-night
,
and
her
little
*NL*
experience
did
not
appeal
to
him
as
important
.
He
let
the
conversation
*NL*
drop
,
save
for
what
she
chose
to
recite
without
solicitation
,
and
Carrie
*NL*
was
not
good
at
that
.
He
took
it
for
granted
that
she
was
doing
very
*NL*
well
and
he
was
relieved
of
further
worry
.
Consequently
he
threw
Carrie
*NL*
into
repression
,
which
was
irritating
.
She
felt
his
indifference
keenly
*NL*
and
longed
to
see
Hurstwood
.
It
was
as
if
he
were
now
the
only
friend
*NL*
she
had
on
earth
.
The
next
morning
Drouet
was
interested
again
,
but
the
*NL*
damage
had
been
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
a
pretty
letter
from
the
manager
,
saying
that
by
the
time
she
*NL*
got
it
he
would
be
waiting
for
her
in
the
park
.
When
she
came
,
he
shone
*NL*
upon
her
as
the
morning
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
''
he
asked
,
``
how
did
you
come
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
enough
,
''
she
said
,
still
somewhat
reduced
after
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
tell
me
just
what
you
did
.
Was
it
pleasant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
related
the
incidents
of
the
rehearsal
,
warming
up
as
she
*NL*
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
delightful
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
I
'm
so
glad
.
I
must
get
over
*NL*
there
to
see
you
.
When
is
the
next
rehearsal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tuesday
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
but
they
do
n't
allow
visitors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagine
I
could
get
in
,
''
said
Hurstwood
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
completely
restored
and
delighted
by
his
consideration
,
but
she
*NL*
made
him
promise
not
to
come
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
you
must
do
your
best
to
please
me
,
''
he
said
encouragingly
.
``
Just
*NL*
remember
that
I
want
you
to
succeed
.
We
will
make
the
performance
worth
*NL*
while
.
You
do
that
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
,
''
said
Carrie
,
brimming
with
affection
and
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
girl
,
''
said
Hurstwood
fondly
.
``
Now
,
remember
,
''
shaking
an
*NL*
affectionate
finger
at
her
,
``
your
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
she
answered
,
looking
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
earth
was
brimming
sunshine
that
morning
.
She
tripped
along
,
*NL*
the
clear
sky
pouring
liquid
blue
into
her
soul
.
Oh
,
blessed
are
the
*NL*
children
of
endeavour
in
this
,
that
they
try
and
are
hopeful
.
And
*NL*
blessed
also
are
they
who
,
knowing
,
smile
and
approve

Chapter
XVIII

JUST
OVER
THE
BORDER
--
A
HAIL
AND
FAREWELL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
evening
of
the
16th
the
subtle
hand
of
Hurstwood
had
made
itself
*NL*
apparent
.
He
had
given
the
word
among
his
friends
--
and
they
were
many
*NL*
and
influential
--
that
here
was
something
which
they
ought
to
attend
,
*NL*
and
,
as
a
consequence
,
the
sale
of
tickets
by
Mr.
Quincel
,
acting
for
*NL*
the
lodge
,
had
been
large
.
Small
four-line
notes
had
appeared
in
all
of
*NL*
the
daily
newspapers
.
These
he
had
arranged
for
by
the
aid
of
one
of
*NL*
his
newspaper
friends
on
the
``
Times
,
''
Mr.
Harry
McGarren
,
the
managing
*NL*
editor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Harry
,
''
Hurstwood
said
to
him
one
evening
,
as
the
latter
stood
at
*NL*
the
bar
drinking
before
wending
his
belated
way
homeward
,
``
you
can
help
*NL*
the
boys
out
,
I
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
McGarren
,
pleased
to
be
consulted
by
the
opulent
*NL*
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Custer
Lodge
is
getting
up
a
little
entertainment
for
their
own
*NL*
good
,
and
they
'd
like
a
little
newspaper
notice
.
You
know
what
I
mean
--
a
*NL*
squib
or
two
saying
that
it
's
going
to
take
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
McGarren
,
``
I
can
fix
that
for
you
,
George
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
Hurstwood
kept
himself
wholly
in
the
background
.
The
*NL*
members
of
Custer
Lodge
could
scarcely
understand
why
their
little
*NL*
affair
was
taking
so
well
.
Mr.
Harry
Quincel
was
looked
upon
as
quite
a
*NL*
star
for
this
sort
of
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
the
16th
had
arrived
Hurstwood
's
friends
had
rallied
*NL*
like
Romans
to
a
senator
's
call
.
A
well-dressed
,
good-natured
,
*NL*
flatteringly-inclined
audience
was
assured
from
the
moment
he
thought
of
*NL*
assisting
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
little
student
had
mastered
her
part
to
her
own
satisfaction
,
much
*NL*
as
she
trembled
for
her
fate
when
she
should
once
face
the
gathered
*NL*
throng
,
behind
the
glare
of
the
footlights
.
She
tried
to
console
herself
*NL*
with
the
thought
that
a
score
of
other
persons
,
men
and
women
,
were
*NL*
equally
tremulous
concerning
the
outcome
of
their
efforts
,
but
she
could
*NL*
not
disassociate
the
general
danger
from
her
own
individual
liability
.
*NL*
She
feared
that
she
would
forget
her
lines
,
that
she
might
be
unable
to
*NL*
master
the
feeling
which
she
now
felt
concerning
her
own
movements
in
*NL*
the
play
.
At
times
she
wished
that
she
had
never
gone
into
the
affair
;
*NL*
at
others
,
she
trembled
lest
she
should
be
paralysed
with
fear
and
*NL*
stand
white
and
gasping
,
not
knowing
what
to
say
and
spoiling
the
entire
*NL*
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
matter
of
the
company
,
Mr.
Bamberger
had
disappeared
.
That
*NL*
hopeless
example
had
fallen
under
the
lance
of
the
director
's
criticism
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Morgan
was
still
present
,
but
envious
and
determined
,
if
for
*NL*
nothing
more
than
spite
,
to
do
as
well
as
Carrie
at
least
.
A
loafing
*NL*
professional
had
been
called
in
to
assume
the
role
of
Ray
,
and
,
while
he
*NL*
was
a
poor
stick
of
his
kind
,
he
was
not
troubled
by
any
of
those
qualms
*NL*
which
attack
the
spirit
of
those
who
have
never
faced
an
audience
.
He
*NL*
swashed
about
-LRB-
cautioned
though
he
was
to
maintain
silence
concerning
*NL*
his
past
theatrical
relationships
-RRB-
in
such
a
self-confident
manner
that
*NL*
he
was
like
to
convince
every
one
of
his
identity
by
mere
matter
of
*NL*
circumstantial
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
easy
,
''
he
said
to
Mrs.
Morgan
,
in
the
usual
affected
stage
*NL*
voice
.
``
An
audience
would
be
the
last
thing
to
trouble
me
.
It
's
the
*NL*
spirit
of
the
part
,
you
know
,
that
is
difficult
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
disliked
his
appearance
,
but
she
was
too
much
the
actress
not
to
*NL*
swallow
his
qualities
with
complaisance
,
seeing
that
she
must
suffer
his
*NL*
fictitious
love
for
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
she
was
ready
to
go
.
Theatrical
paraphernalia
had
been
provided
*NL*
over
and
above
her
care
.
She
had
practised
her
make-up
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
had
rehearsed
and
arranged
her
material
for
the
evening
by
one
o'clock
,
*NL*
and
had
gone
home
to
have
a
final
look
at
her
part
,
waiting
for
the
*NL*
evening
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
occasion
the
lodge
sent
a
carriage
.
Drouet
rode
with
her
as
far
*NL*
as
the
door
,
and
then
went
about
the
neighbouring
stores
,
looking
*NL*
for
some
good
cigars
.
The
little
actress
marched
nervously
into
her
*NL*
dressing-room
and
began
that
painfully
anticipated
matter
of
make-up
*NL*
which
was
to
transform
her
,
a
simple
maiden
,
to
Laura
,
The
Belle
of
*NL*
Society
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flare
of
the
gas-jets
,
the
open
trunks
,
suggestive
of
travel
and

display
,
the
scattered
contents
of
the
make-up
box
--
rouge
,
pearl
*NL*
powder
,
whiting
,
burnt
cork
,
India
ink
,
pencils
for
the

,
*NL*
wigs
,
scissors
,
looking-glasses
,
drapery
--
in
short
,
all
the
nameless
*NL*
paraphernalia
of
disguise
,
have
a
remarkable
atmosphere
of
their
own
.
*NL*
Since
her
arrival
in
the
city
many
things
had
influenced
her
,
but
always
*NL*
in
a
far-removed
manner
.
This
new
atmosphere
was
more
friendly
.
It
was
*NL*
wholly
unlike
the
great
brilliant
mansions
which
waved
her
coldly
away
,
*NL*
permitting
her
only
awe
and
distant
wonder
.
This
took
her
by
the
hand
*NL*
kindly
,
as
one
who
says
,
``
My
dear
,
come
in
.
''
It
opened
for
her
as
if
*NL*
for
its
own
.
She
had
wondered
at
the
greatness
of
the
names
upon
the
*NL*
bill-boards
,
the
marvel
of
the
long
notices
in
the
papers
,
the
beauty
*NL*
of
the
dresses
upon
the
stage
,
the
atmosphere
of
carriages
,
flowers
,
*NL*
refinement
.
Here
was
no
illusion
.
Here
was
an
open
door
to
see
all
of
*NL*
that
.
She
had
come
upon
it
as
one
who
stumbles
upon
a
secret
passage
*NL*
and
,
behold
,
she
was
in
the
chamber
of
diamonds
and
delight
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
dressed
with
a
flutter
,
in
her
little
stage
room
,
hearing
the
*NL*
voices
outside
,
seeing
Mr.
Quincel
hurrying
here
and
there
,
noting
Mrs.
*NL*
Morgan
and
Mrs.
Hoagland
at
their
nervous
work
of
preparation
,
seeing
*NL*
all
the
twenty
members
of
the
cast
moving
about
and
worrying
over
what
*NL*
the
result
would
be
,
she
could
not
help
thinking
what
a
delight
this
*NL*
would
be
if
it
would
endure
;
how
perfect
a
state
,
if
she
could
only
do
*NL*
well
now
,
and
then
some
time
get
a
place
as
a
real
actress
.
The
thought
*NL*
had
taken
a
mighty
hold
upon
her
.
It
hummed
in
her
ears
as
the
melody
of
*NL*
an
old
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
in
the
little
lobby
another
scene
was
begin
enacted
.
Without
*NL*
the
interest
of
Hurstwood
,
the
little
hall
would
probably
have
been
*NL*
comfortably
filled
,
for
the
members
of
the
lodge
were
moderately
*NL*
interested
in
its
welfare
.
Hurstwood
's
word
,
however
,
had
gone
the
*NL*
rounds
.
It
was
to
be
a
full-dress
affair
.
The
four
boxes
had
been
taken
.
*NL*
Dr.
Norman
McNeill
Hale
and
his
wife
were
to
occupy
one
.
This
was
quite
*NL*
a
card
.
C.
R.
Walker
,
dry-goods
merchant
and
possessor
of
at
least
two
*NL*
hundred
thousand
dollars
,
had
taken
another
;
a
well-known
coal
merchant
*NL*
had
been
induced
to
take
the
third
,
and
Hurstwood
and
his
friends
the
*NL*
fourth
.
Among
the
latter
was
Drouet
.
The
people
who
were
now
pouring
*NL*
here
were
not
celebrities
,
nor
even
local
notabilities
,
in
a
general
*NL*
sense
.
They
were
the
lights
of
a
certain
circle
--
the
circle
of
small
*NL*
fortunes
and
secret
order
distinctions
.
These
gentlemen
Elks
knew
the
*NL*
standing
of
one
another
.
They
had
regard
for
the
ability
which
could
*NL*
amass
a
small
fortune
,
own
a
nice
home
,
keep
a
barouche
or
carriage
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
wear
fine
clothes
,
and
maintain
a
good
mercantile
position
.
*NL*
Naturally
,
Hurstwood
,
who
was
a
little
above
the
order
of
mind
*NL*
which
accepted
this
standard
as
perfect
,
who
had
shrewdness
and
much
*NL*
assumption
of
dignity
,
who
held
an
imposing
and
authoritative
position
,
*NL*
and
commanded
friendship
by
intuitive
tact
in
handling
people
,
was
*NL*
quite
a
figure
.
He
was
more
generally
known
than
most
others
in
the
same
*NL*
circle
,
and
was
looked
upon
as
some
one
whose
reserve
covered
a
mine
of
*NL*
influence
and
solid
financial
prosperity
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-night
he
was
in
his
element
.
He
came
with
several
friends
directly
*NL*
from
Rector
's
in
a
carriage
.
In
the
lobby
he
met
Drouet
,
who
was
*NL*
just
returning
from
a
trip
for
more
cigars
.
All
five
now
joined
in
an
*NL*
animated
conversation
concerning
the
company
present
and
the
general
*NL*
drift
of
lodge
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
here
?
''
said
Hurstwood
,
passing
into
the
theatre
proper
,
where
*NL*
the
lights
were
turned
up
and
a
company
of
gentlemen
were
laughing
and
*NL*
talking
in
the
open
space
back
of
the
seats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Hurstwood
?
''
came
from
the
first
individual
*NL*
recognised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
see
you
,
''
said
the
latter
,
grasping
his
hand
lightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looks
quite
an
affair
,
does
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
''
said
the
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Custer
seems
to
have
the
backing
of
its
members
,
''
observed
the
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
should
,
''
said
the
knowing
manager
.
``
I
'm
glad
to
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
George
,
''
said
another
rotund
citizen
,
whose
avoirdupois
made
*NL*
necessary
an
almost
alarming
display
of
starched
shirt
bosom
,
``
how
goes
*NL*
it
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
,
''
said
the
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
brings
you
over
here
?
You
're
not
a
member
of
Custer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-nature
,
''
returned
the
manager
.
``
Like
to
see
the
boys
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wife
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
could
n't
come
to-night
.
She
's
not
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry
to
hear
it
--
nothing
serious
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
just
feeling
a
little
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
Mrs.
Hurstwood
when
she
was
travelling
once
with
you
over
to
*NL*
St.
Joe
--
''
and
here
the
newcomer
launched
off
in
a
trivial
recollection
,
*NL*
which
was
terminated
by
the
arrival
of
more
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
George
,
how
are
you
?
''
said
another
genial
West
Side
politician
*NL*
and
lodge
member
.
``
My
,
but
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
again
;
how
are
things
,
*NL*
anyhow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
I
see
you
got
that
nomination
for
alderman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
whipped
them
out
over
there
without
much
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
suppose
Hennessy
will
do
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
'll
go
back
to
his
brick
business
.
He
has
a
brick-yard
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
that
,
''
said
the
manager
.
``
Felt
pretty
sore
,
I
suppose
,
*NL*
over
his
defeat
.
''
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
the
other
,
winking
shrewdly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
more
favoured
of
his
friends
whom
he
had
invited
began
to
*NL*
roll
up
in
carriages
now
.
They
came
shuffling
in
with
a
great
show
of
*NL*
finery
and
much
evident
feeling
of
content
and
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
are
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
turning
to
one
from
a
group
with
whom
he
*NL*
was
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
returned
the
newcomer
,
a
gentleman
of
about
forty-five
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
say
,
''
he
whispered
,
jovially
,
pulling
Hurstwood
over
by
the
*NL*
shoulder
so
that
he
might
whisper
in
his
ear
,
``
if
this
is
n't
a
good
*NL*
show
,
I
'll
punch
your
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
pay
for
seeing
your
old
friends
.
Bother
the
show
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
another
who
inquired
,
``
Is
it
something
really
good
?
''
the
manager
*NL*
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
do
n't
suppose
so
.
''
Then
,
lifting
his
hand
graciously
,
*NL*
``
For
the
lodge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lots
of
boys
out
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
look
up
Shanahan
.
He
was
just
asking
for
you
a
moment
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thus
that
the
little
theatre
resounded
to
a
babble
of
successful
*NL*
voices
,
the
creak
of
fine
clothes
,
the
commonplace
of
good-nature
,
and
*NL*
all
largely
because
of
this
man
's
bidding
.
Look
at
him
any
time
within
*NL*
the
half
hour
before
the
curtain
was
up
,
he
was
a
member
of
an
eminent
*NL*
group
--
a
rounded
company
of
five
or
more
whose
stout
figures
,
large
*NL*
white
bosoms
,
and
shining
pins
bespoke
the
character
of
their
success
.
*NL*
The
gentlemen
who
brought
their
wives
called
him
out
to
shake
hands
.
*NL*
Seats
clicked
,
ushers
bowed
while
he
looked
blandly
on
.
He
was
evidently
*NL*
a
light
among
them
,
reflecting
in
his
personality
the
ambitions
of
those
*NL*
who
greeted
him
.
He
was
acknowledged
,
fawned
upon
,
in
a
way
lionised
.
*NL*
Through
it
all
one
could
see
the
standing
of
the
man
.
It
was
greatness
*NL*
in
a
way
,
small
as
it
was
.

Chapter

AN
HOUR
IN
ELFLAND
--
A
CLAMOUR
HALF
HEARD
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
curtain
was
ready
to
go
up
.
All
the
details
of
the
make-up
*NL*
had
been
completed
,
and
the
company
settled
down
as
the
leader
of
the
*NL*
small
,
hired
orchestra
tapped
significantly
upon
his
music
rack
with
*NL*
his
baton
and
began
the
soft
curtain-raising
strain
.
Hurstwood
ceased
*NL*
talking
,
and
went
with
Drouet
and
his
friend
Sagar
Morrison
around
to
*NL*
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
we
'll
see
how
the
little
girl
does
,
''
he
said
to
Drouet
,
in
a
tone
*NL*
which
no
one
else
could
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
stage
,
six
of
the
characters
had
already
appeared
in
the
opening
*NL*
parlour
scene
.
Drouet
and
Hurstwood
saw
at
a
glance
that
Carrie
was
*NL*
not
among
them
,
and
went
on
talking
in
a
whisper
.
Mrs.
Morgan
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Hoagland
,
and
the
actor
who
had
taken
Bamberger
's
part
were
representing
*NL*
the
principal
roles
in
this
scene
.
The
professional
,
whose
name
was
*NL*
Patton
,
had
little
to
recommend
him
outside
of
his
assurance
,
but
this
*NL*
at
the
present
moment
was
most
palpably
needed
.
Mrs.
Morgan
,
as
Pearl
,
*NL*
was
stiff
with
fright
.
Mrs.
Hoagland
was
husky
in
the
throat
.
The
whole
*NL*
company
was
so
weak-kneed
that
the
lines
were
merely
spoken
,
and
nothing
*NL*
more
.
It
took
all
the
hope
and
uncritical
good-nature
of
the
audience
to
*NL*
keep
from
manifesting
pity
by
that
unrest
which
is
the
agony
of
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
perfectly
indifferent
.
He
took
it
for
granted
that
it
*NL*
would
be
worthless
.
All
he
cared
for
was
to
have
it
endurable
enough
to
*NL*
allow
for
pretension
and
congratulation
afterward
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
first
rush
of
fright
,
however
,
the
players
got
over
the
*NL*
danger
of
collapse
.
They
rambled
weakly
forward
,
losing
nearly
all
the
*NL*
expression
which
was
intended
,
and
making
the
thing
dull
in
the
extreme
,
*NL*
when
Carrie
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
glance
at
her
,
and
both
Hurstwood
and
Drouet
saw
plainly
that
she
*NL*
also
was
weak-kneed
.
She
came
faintly
across
the
stage
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
sir
;
we
have
been
looking
for
you
since
eight
o'clock
,
''
but
*NL*
with
so
little
colour
and
in
such
a
feeble
voice
that
it
was
positively
*NL*
painful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
frightened
,
''
whispered
Drouet
to
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
line
presently
which
was
supposed
to
be
funny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
as
much
as
to
say
that
I
'm
a
sort
of
life
pill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
out
so
flat
,
however
,
that
it
was
a
deathly
thing
.
Drouet
*NL*
fidgeted
.
Hurstwood
moved
his
toe
the
least
bit
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
place
in
which
Laura
was
to
rise
and
,
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
impending
disaster
,
say
,
sadly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
had
n't
said
that
,
Pearl
.
You
know
the
old
proverb
,
`
Call
a
*NL*
maid
by
a
married
name
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lack
of
feeling
in
the
thing
was
ridiculous
.
Carrie
did
not
get
it
*NL*
at
all
.
She
seemed
to
be
talking
in
her
sleep
.
It
looked
as
if
she
*NL*
were
certain
to
be
a
wretched
failure
.
She
was
more
hopeless
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Morgan
,
who
had
recovered
somewhat
,
and
was
now
saying
her
lines
clearly
*NL*
at
least
.
Drouet
looked
away
from
the
stage
at
the
audience
.
The
latter
*NL*
held
out
silently
,
hoping
for
a
general
change
,
of
course
.
Hurstwood
*NL*
fixed
his
eye
on
Carrie
,
as
if
to
hypnotise
her
into
doing
better
.
He
*NL*
was
pouring
determination
of
his
own
in
her
direction
.
He
felt
sorry
for
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
more
minutes
it
fell
to
her
to
read
the
letter
sent
in
by
*NL*
the
strange
villain
.
The
audience
had
been
slightly
diverted
by
a
*NL*
conversation
between
the
professional
actor
and
a
character
called
*NL*
Snorky
,
impersonated
by
a
short
little
American
,
who
really
developed
*NL*
some
humour
as
a
half-crazed
,
one-armed
soldier
,
turned
messenger
for
*NL*
a
living
.
He
bawled
his
lines
out
with
such
defiance
that
,
while
they
*NL*
really
did
not
partake
of
the
humour
intended
,
they
were
funny
.
Now
he
*NL*
was
off
,
however
,
and
it
was
back
to
pathos
,
with
Carrie
as
the
chief
*NL*
figure
.
She
did
not
recover
.
She
wandered
through
the
whole
scene
*NL*
between
herself
and
the
intruding
villain
,
straining
the
patience
of
the
*NL*
audience
,
and
finally
exiting
,
much
to
their
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She

too
nervous
,
''
said
Drouet
,
feeling
in
the
mildness
of
the
remark
*NL*
that
he
was
lying
for
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
go
back
and
say
a
word
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
was
glad
to
do
anything
for
relief
.
He
fairly
hustled
around
to
*NL*
the
side
entrance
,
and
was
let
in
by
the
friendly
door-keeper
.
Carrie
*NL*
was
standing
in
the
wings
,
weakly
waiting
her
next
cue
,
all
the
snap
and
*NL*
nerve
gone
out
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Cad
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
her
,
``
you
must
n't
be
nervous
.
Wake
up
.
*NL*
Those
guys
out
there
do
n't
amount
to
anything
.
What
are
you
afraid
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
just
do
n't
seem
to
be
able
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
grateful
for
the
drummer
's
presence
,
though
.
She
had
found
the
*NL*
company
so
nervous
that
her
own
strength
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
Brace
up
.
What
are
you
afraid
of
?
Go
on
out
*NL*
there
now
,
and
do
the
trick
.
What
do
you
care
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
revived
a
little
under
the
drummer
's
electrical
,
nervous
*NL*
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
do
so
very
bad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
.
All
you
need
is
a
little
more
ginger
.
Do
it
as
you
showed
*NL*
me
.
Get
that
toss
of
your
head
you
had
the
other
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
remembered
her
triumph
in
the
room
.
She
tried
to
think
she
could
*NL*
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
next
?
''
he
said
,
looking
at
her
part
,
which
she
had
been
*NL*
studying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
scene
between
Ray
and
me
when
I
refuse
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
you
do
that
lively
,
''
said
the
drummer
.
``
Put
in
snap
,
that
's
*NL*
the
thing
.
Act
as
if
you
did
n't
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
turn
next
,
Miss
Madenda
,
''
said
the
prompter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
a
chump
for
being
afraid
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
Come
on
now
,
*NL*
brace
up
.
I
'll
watch
you
from
right
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
now
go
on
.
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prompter
signalled
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
out
,
weak
as
ever
,
but
suddenly
her
nerve
partially
*NL*
returned
.
She
thought
of
Drouet
looking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ray
,
''
she
said
,
gently
,
using
a
tone
of
voice
much
more
calm
than
when
*NL*
she
had
last
appeared
.
It
was
the
scene
which
had
pleased
the
director
*NL*
at
the
rehearsal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
easier
,
''
thought
Hurstwood
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
do
the
part
as
she
had
at
rehearsal
,
but
she
was
better
.
The
*NL*
audience
was
at
least
not
irritated
.
The
improvement
of
the
work
of
the
*NL*
entire
company
took
away
direct
observation
from
her
.
They
were
making
*NL*
very
fair
progress
,
and
now
it
looked
as
if
the
play
would
be
passable
,
*NL*
in
the
less
trying
parts
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
came
off
warm
and
nervous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
looking
at
him
,
``
was
it
any
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
say
so
.
That
's
the
way
.
Put
life
into
it
.
You
did
that
*NL*
about
a
thousand
per
cent
.
better
than
you
did
the
other
scene
.
Now
go
*NL*
on
and
fire
up
.
You
can
do
it
.
Knock
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
really
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
,
I
should
say
so
.
What
comes
next
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
ballroom
scene
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
do
that
all
right
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
woman
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
you
did
it
for
me
!
Now
you
go
out
there
and
*NL*
do
it
.
It
'll
be
fun
for
you
.
Just
do
as
you
did
in
the
room
.
If
you
'll
*NL*
reel
it
off
that
way
,
I
'll
bet
you
make
a
hit
.
Now
,
what
'll
you
bet
?
You
*NL*
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
drummer
usually
allowed
his
ardent
good-nature
to
get
the
better
of
*NL*
his
speech
.
He
really
did
think
that
Carrie
had
acted
this
particular
*NL*
scene
very
well
,
and
he
wanted
her
to
repeat
it
in
public
.
His
*NL*
enthusiasm
was
due
to
the
mere
spirit
of
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
time
came
,
he
buoyed
Carrie
up
most
effectually
.
He
began
to
*NL*
make
her
feel
as
if
she
had
done
very
well
.
The
old
melancholy
of
desire
*NL*
began
to
come
back
as
he
talked
at
her
,
and
by
the
time
the
situation
*NL*
rolled
around
she
was
running
high
in
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
can
do
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
you
can
.
Now
you
go
ahead
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
stage
,
Mrs.
Van
Dam
was
making
her
cruel
insinuation
against
*NL*
Laura
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
listened
,
and
caught
the
infection
of
something
--
she
did
not
know
*NL*
what
.
Her
nostrils
sniffed
thinly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
,
''
the
professional
actor
began
,
speaking
as
Ray
,
``
that
society
*NL*
is
a
terrible
avenger
of
insult
.
Have
you
ever
heard
of
the
Siberian
*NL*
wolves
?
When
one
of
the
pack
falls
through
weakness
,
the
others
devour
*NL*
him
.
It
is
not
an
elegant
comparison
,
but
there
is
something
wolfish
in
*NL*
society
.
Laura
has
mocked
it
with
a
pretence
,
and
society
,
which
is
made
*NL*
up
of
pretence
,
will
bitterly
resent
the
mockery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sound
of
her
stage
name
Carrie
started
.
She
began
to
feel
the
*NL*
bitterness
of
the
situation
.
The
feelings
of
the
outcast
descended
upon
*NL*
her
.
She
hung
at
the
wing
's
edge
,
wrapt
in
her
own
mounting
thoughts
.
*NL*
She
hardly
heard
anything
more
,
save
her
own
rumbling
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
girls
,
''
said
Mrs.
Van
Dam
,
solemnly
,
``
let
us
look
after
our
*NL*
things
.
They
are
no
longer
safe
when
such
an
accomplished
thief
enters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cue
,
''
said
the
prompter
,
close
to
her
side
,
but
she
did
not
hear
.
*NL*
Already
she
was
moving
forward
with
a
steady
grace
,
born
of
inspiration
.
*NL*
She
dawned
upon
the
audience
,
handsome
and
proud
,
shifting
,
with
the
*NL*
necessity
of
the
situation
,
to
a
cold
,
white
,
helpless
object
,
as
the
*NL*
social
pack
moved
away
from
her
scornfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
blinked
his
eyes
and
caught
the
infection
.
The
radiating
waves
*NL*
of
feeling
and
sincerity
were
already
breaking
against
the
farthest
*NL*
walls
of
the
chamber
.
The
magic
of
passion
,
which
will
yet
dissolve
the
*NL*
world
,
was
here
at
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
drawing
,
too
,
of
attention
,
a
riveting
of
feeling
,
*NL*
heretofore
wandering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ray
!
Ray
!
Why
do
you
not
come
back
to
her
?
''
was
the
cry
of
Pearl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
eye
was
fixed
on
Carrie
,
still
proud
and
scornful
.
They
moved
as
*NL*
she
moved
.
Their
eyes
were
with
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morgan
,
as
Pearl
,
approached
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
home
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
Carrie
,
her
voice
assuming
for
the
first
time
a
*NL*
penetrating
quality
which
it
had
never
known
.
``
Stay
with
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
an
almost
accusing
hand
toward
her
lover
.
Then
,
with
a
*NL*
pathos
which
struck
home
because
of
its
utter
simplicity
,
``
He
shall
not
*NL*
suffer
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
realised
that
he
was
seeing
something
extraordinarily
good
.
*NL*
It
was
heightened
for
him
by
the
applause
of
the
audience
as
the
curtain
*NL*
descended
and
the
fact
that
it
was
Carrie
.
He
thought
now
that
she
was
*NL*
beautiful
.
She
had
done
something
which
was
above
his
sphere
.
He
felt
a
*NL*
keen
delight
in
realising
that
she
was
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
,
''
he
said
,
and
then
,
seized
by
a
sudden
impulse
,
arose
and
went
*NL*
about
to
the
stage
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
in
upon
Carrie
she
was
still
with
Drouet
.
His
feelings
for
*NL*
her
were
most
exuberant
.
He
was
almost
swept
away
by
the
strength
and
*NL*
feeling
she
exhibited
.
His
desire
was
to
pour
forth
his
praise
with
the
*NL*
unbounded
feelings
of
a
lover
,
but
here
was
Drouet
,
whose
affection
was
*NL*
also
rapidly
reviving
.
The
latter
was
more
fascinated
,
if
anything
,
than
*NL*
Hurstwood
.
At
least
,
in
the
nature
of
things
,
it
took
a
more
ruddy
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
said
Drouet
,
``
you
did
out
of
sight
.
That
was
simply
great
.
*NL*
I
knew
you
could
do
it
.
Oh
,
but
you
're
a
little
daisy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
's
eyes
flamed
with
the
light
of
achievement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
do
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
?
Well
,
I
guess
.
Did
n't
you
hear
the
applause
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
faint
sound
of
clapping
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
got
it
something
like
--
I
felt
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Hurstwood
came
in
.
Instinctively
he
felt
the
change
in
Drouet
.
*NL*
He
saw
that
the
drummer
was
near
to
Carrie
,
and
jealousy
leaped
alight
*NL*
in
his
bosom
.
In
a
flash
of
thought
,
he
reproached
himself
for
having
*NL*
sent
him
back
.
Also
,
he
hated
him
as
an
intruder
.
He
could
scarcely
pull
*NL*
himself
down
to
the
level
where
he
would
have
to
congratulate
Carrie
as
*NL*
a
friend
.
Nevertheless
,
the
man
mastered
himself
,
and
it
was
a
triumph
.
*NL*
He
almost
jerked
the
old
subtle
light
to
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
Carrie
,
``
I
would
come
around
and
tell
*NL*
you
how
well
you
did
,
Mrs.
Drouet
.
It
was
delightful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
took
the
cue
,
and
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
telling
her
,
''
put
in
Drouet
,
now
delighted
with
his
*NL*
possession
,
``
that
I
thought
she
did
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
did
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
turning
upon
Carrie
eyes
in
which
she
*NL*
read
more
than
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
laughed
luxuriantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
as
well
in
the
rest
of
the
play
,
you
will
make
us
all
think
*NL*
you
are
a
born
actress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
smiled
again
.
She
felt
the
acuteness
of
Hurstwood
's
position
,
*NL*
and
wished
deeply
that
she
could
be
alone
with
him
,
but
she
did
not
*NL*
understand
the
change
in
Drouet
.
Hurstwood
found
that
he
could
not
talk
,
*NL*
repressed
as
he
was
,
and
grudging
Drouet
every
moment
of
his
presence
,
*NL*
he
bowed
himself
out
with
the
elegance
of
a
Faust
.
Outside
he
set
his
*NL*
teeth
with
envy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
!
''
he
said
,
``
is
he
always
going
to
be
in
the
way
?
''
He
was
moody
*NL*
when
he
got
back
to
the
box
,
and
could
not
talk
for
thinking
of
his
*NL*
wretched
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
curtain
for
the
next
act
arose
,
Drouet
came
back
.
He
was
*NL*
very
much
enlivened
in
temper
and
inclined
to
whisper
,
but
Hurstwood
*NL*
pretended
interest
.
He
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
stage
,
although
Carrie
was
*NL*
not
there
,
a
short
bit
of
melodramatic
comedy
preceding
her
entrance
.
*NL*
He
did
not
see
what
was
going
on
,
however
.
He
was
thinking
his
own
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
they
were
wretched
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
progress
of
the
play
did
not
improve
matters
for
him
.
Carrie
,
from
*NL*
now
on
,
was
easily
the
centre
of
interest
.
The
audience
,
which
had
*NL*
been
inclined
to
feel
that
nothing
could
be
good
after
the
first
gloomy
*NL*
impression
,
now
went
to
the
other
extreme
and
saw
power
where
it
was
*NL*
not
.
The
general
feeling
reacted
on
Carrie
.
She
presented
her
part
with
*NL*
some
felicity
,
though
nothing
like
the
intensity
which
had
aroused
the
*NL*
feeling
at
the
end
of
the
long
first
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
Hurstwood
and
Drouet
viewed
her
pretty
figure
with
rising
feelings
.
*NL*
The
fact
that
such
ability
should
reveal
itself
in
her
,
that
they
should
*NL*
see
it
set
forth
under
such
effective
circumstances
,
framed
almost
in
*NL*
massy
gold
and
shone
upon
by
the
appropriate
lights
of
sentiment
and
*NL*
personality
,
heightened
her
charm
for
them
.
She
was
more
than
the
old
*NL*
Carrie
to
Drouet
.
He
longed
to
be
at
home
with
her
until
he
could
tell
*NL*
her
.
He
awaited
impatiently
the
end
,
when
they
should
go
home
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
on
the
contrary
,
saw
in
the
strength
of
her
new
*NL*
attractiveness
his
miserable
predicament
.
He
could
have
cursed
the
*NL*
man
beside
him
.
By
the
Lord
,
he
could
not
even
applaud
feelingly
as
he
*NL*
would
.
For
once
he
must
simulate
when
it
left
a
taste
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
last
act
that
Carrie
's
fascination
for
her
lovers
assumed
*NL*
its
most
effective
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
listened
to
its
progress
,
wondering
when
Carrie
would
come
on
.
*NL*
He
had
not
long
to
wait
.
The
author
had
used
the
artifice
of
sending
all
*NL*
the
merry
company
for
a
drive
,
and
now
Carrie
came
in
alone
.
It
was
*NL*
the
first
time
that
Hurstwood
had
had
a
chance
to
see
her
facing
the
*NL*
audience
quite
alone
,
for
nowhere
else
had
she
been
without
a
foil
of
*NL*
some
sort
.
He
suddenly
felt
,
as
she
entered
,
that
her
old
strength
--
the
*NL*
power
that
had
grasped
him
at
the
end
of
the
first
act
--
had
come
back
.
*NL*
She
seemed
to
be
gaining
feeling
,
now
that
the
play
was
drawing
to
a
*NL*
close
and
the
opportunity
for
great
action
was
passing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Pearl
,
''
she
said
,
speaking
with
natural
pathos
.
``
It
is
a
sad
thing
*NL*
to
want
for
happiness
,
but
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
see
another
groping
*NL*
about
blindly
for
it
,
when
it
is
almost
within
the
grasp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
gazing
now
sadly
out
upon
the
open
sea
,
her
arm
resting
*NL*
listlessly
upon
the
polished
door-post
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
began
to
feel
a
deep
sympathy
for
her
and
for
himself
.
He
*NL*
could
almost
feel
that
she
was
talking
to
him
.
He
was
,
by
a
combination
*NL*
of
feelings
and
entanglements
,
almost
deluded
by
that
quality
of
voice
*NL*
and
manner
which
,
like
a
pathetic
strain
of
music
,
seems
ever
a
*NL*
personal
and
intimate
thing
.
Pathos
has
this
quality
,
that
it
seems
ever
*NL*
addressed
to
one
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
she
can
be
very
happy
with
him
,
''
went
on
the
little
actress
.
*NL*
``
Her
sunny
temper
,
her
joyous
face
will
brighten
any
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
slowly
toward
the
audience
without
seeing
.
There
was
so
much
*NL*
simplicity
in
her
movements
that
she
seemed
wholly
alone
.
Then
she
found
*NL*
a
seat
by
a
table
,
and
turned
over
some
books
,
devoting
a
thought
to
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
no
longings
for
what
I
may
not
have
,
''
she
breathed
in
*NL*
conclusion
--
and
it
was
almost
a
sigh
--
``
my
existence
hidden
from
all
save
*NL*
two
in
the
wide
world
,
and
making
my
joy
out
of
the
joy
of
that
innocent
*NL*
girl
who
will
soon
be
his
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
sorry
when
a
character
,
known
as
Peach
Blossom
,
*NL*
interrupted
her
.
He
stirred
irritably
,
for
he
wished
her
to
go
on
.
He
*NL*
was
charmed
by
the
pale
face
,
the
lissome
figure
,
draped
in
pearl
grey
,
*NL*
with
a
coiled
string
of
pearls
at
the
throat
.
Carrie
had
the
air
of
*NL*
one
who
was
weary
and
in
need
of
protection
,
and
,
under
the
fascinating
*NL*
make-believe
of
the
moment
,
he
rose
in
feeling
until
he
was
ready
in
*NL*
spirit
to
go
to
her
and
ease
her
out
of
her
misery
by
adding
to
his
own
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
Carrie
was
alone
again
,
and
was
saying
,
with
animation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
return
to
the
city
,
no
matter
what
dangers
may
lurk
here
.
I
must
*NL*
go
,
secretly
if
I
can
;
openly
,
if
I
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sound
of
horses
'
hoofs
outside
,
and
then
Ray
's
voice
saying
:
*NL*
``
No
,
I
shall
not
ride
again
.
Put
him
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
,
and
then
began
a
scene
which
had
as
much
to
do
with
the
*NL*
creation
of
the
tragedy
of
affection
in
Hurstwood
as
anything
in
his
*NL*
peculiar
and
involved
career
.
For
Carrie
had
resolved
to
make
something
*NL*
of
this
scene
,
and
,
now
that
the
cue
had
come
,
it
began
to
take
a
*NL*
feeling
hold
upon
her
.
Both
Hurstwood
and
Drouet
noted
the
rising
*NL*
sentiment
as
she
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
had
gone
with
Pearl
,
''
she
said
to
her
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
go
part
of
the
way
,
but
I
left
the
Party
a
mile
down
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
and
Pearl
had
no
disagreement
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
yes
;
that
is
,
we
always
have
.
Our
social
barometers
always
stand
at
*NL*
`
cloudy
'
and
`
overcast
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
whose
fault
is
that
?
''
she
said
,
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
mine
,
''
he
answered
,
pettishly
.
``
I
know
I
do
all
I
can
--
I
say
all
I
*NL*
can
--
but
she
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
rather
awkwardly
put
by
Patton
,
but
Carrie
redeemed
it
with
a
*NL*
grace
which
was
inspiring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
is
your
wife
,
''
she
said
,
fixing
her
whole
attention
upon
the
*NL*
stilled
actor
,
and
softening
the
quality
of
her
voice
until
it
was
again
*NL*
low
and
musical
.
``
Ray
,
my
friend
,
courtship
is
the
text
from
which
*NL*
the
whole
sermon
of
married
life
takes
its
theme
.
Do
not
let
yours
be
*NL*
discontented
and
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
two
little
hands
together
and
pressed
them
appealingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
gazed
with
slightly
parted
lips
.
Drouet
was
fidgeting
with
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
my
wife
,
yes
,
''
went
on
the
actor
in
a
manner
which
was
weak
by
*NL*
comparison
,
but
which
could
not
now
spoil
the
tender
atmosphere
which
*NL*
Carrie
had
created
and
maintained
.
She
did
not
seem
to
feel
that
he
was
*NL*
wretched
.
She
would
have
done
nearly
as
well
with
a
block
of
wood
.
The
*NL*
accessories
she
needed
were
within
her
own
imagination
.
The
acting
of
*NL*
others
could
not
affect
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
repent
already
?
''
she
said
,
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
lost
you
,
''
he
said
,
seizing
her
little
hand
,
``
and
I
was
at
the
*NL*
mercy
of
any
flirt
who
chose
to
give
me
an
inviting
look
.
It
was
your
*NL*
fault
--
you
know
it
was
--
why
did
you
leave
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
turned
slowly
away
,
and
seemed
to
be
mastering
some
impulse
in
*NL*
silence
.
Then
she
turned
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ray
,
''
she
said
,
``
the
greatest
happiness
I
have
ever
felt
has
been
the
*NL*
thought
that
all
your
affection
was
forever
bestowed
upon
a
virtuous
*NL*
woman
,
your
equal
in
family
,
fortune
,
and
accomplishments
.
What
a
*NL*
revelation
do
you
make
to
me
now
!
What
is
it
makes
you
continually
war
*NL*
with
your
happiness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
question
was
asked
so
simply
that
it
came
to
the
audience
and
*NL*
the
lover
as
a
personal
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
it
came
to
the
part
where
the
lover
exclaimed
,
``
Be
to
me
as
you
*NL*
used
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
answered
,
with
affecting
sweetness
,
``
I
can
not
be
that
to
you
,
but
*NL*
I
can
speak
in
the
spirit
of
the
Laura
who
is
dead
to
you
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
it
as
you
will
,
''
said
Patton
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
leaned
forward
.
The
whole
audience
was
silent
and
intent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
woman
you
look
upon
be
wise
or
vain
,
''
said
Carrie
,
her
eyes
*NL*
bent
sadly
upon
the
lover
,
who
had
sunk
into
a
seat
,
``
beautiful
or
*NL*
homely
,
rich
or
poor
,
she
has
but
one
thing
she
can
really
give
or
*NL*
refuse
--
her
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
felt
a
scratch
in
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
beauty
,
her
wit
,
her
accomplishments
,
she
may
sell
to
you
;
but
her
*NL*
love
is
the
treasure
without
money
and
without
price
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
suffered
this
as
a
personal
appeal
.
It
came
to
him
as
if
*NL*
they
were
alone
,
and
he
could
hardly
restrain
the
tears
for
sorrow
*NL*
over
the
hopeless
,
pathetic
,
and
yet
dainty
and
appealing
woman
whom
he
*NL*
loved
.
Drouet
also
was
beside
himself
.
He
was
resolving
that
he
would
be
*NL*
to
Carrie
what
he
had
never
been
before
.
He
would
marry
her
,
by
George
!
*NL*
She
was
worth
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
asks
only
in
return
,
''
said
Carrie
,
scarcely
hearing
the
small
,
*NL*
scheduled
reply
of
her
lover
,
and
putting
herself
even
more
in
harmony
*NL*
with
the
plaintive
melody
now
issuing
from
the
orchestra
,
``
that
when
you
*NL*
look
upon
her
your
eyes
shall
speak
devotion
;
that
when
you
address
her
*NL*
your
voice
shall
be
gentle
,
loving
,
and
kind
;
that
you
shall
not
despise
*NL*
her
because
she
can
not
understand
all
at
once
your
vigorous
thoughts
*NL*
and
ambitious
designs
;
for
,
when
misfortune
and
evil
have
defeated
your
*NL*
greatest
purposes
,
her
love
remains
to
console
you
.
You
look
to
the
*NL*
trees
,
''
she
continued
,
while
Hurstwood
restrained
his
feelings
only
by
*NL*
the
grimmest
repression
,
``
for
strength
and
grandeur
;
do
not
despise
the
*NL*
flowers
because
their
fragrance
is
all
they
have
to
give
.
Remember
,
''
she
*NL*
concluded
,
tenderly
,
``
love
is
all
a
woman
has
to
give
,
''
and
she
laid
a
*NL*
strange
,
sweet
accent
on
the
all
,
``
but
it
is
the
only
thing
which
God
*NL*
permits
us
to
carry
beyond
the
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
were
in
the
most
harrowed
state
of
affection
.
They
scarcely
*NL*
heard
the
few
remaining
words
with
which
the
scene
concluded
.
They
only
*NL*
saw
their
idol
,
moving
about
with
appealing
grace
,
continuing
a
power
*NL*
which
to
them
was
a
revelation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
resolved
a
thousands
things
,
Drouet
as
well
.
They
joined
*NL*
equally
in
the
burst
of
applause
which
called
Carrie
out
.
Drouet
pounded
*NL*
his
hands
until
they
ached
.
Then
he
jumped
up
again
and
started
out
.
As
*NL*
he
went
,
Carrie
came
out
,
and
,
seeing
an
immense
basket
of
flowers
being
*NL*
hurried
down
the
aisle
toward
her
she
waited
.
They
were
Hurstwood
's
.
*NL*
She
looked
toward
the
manager
's
box
for
a
moment
,
caught
his
eye
,
and
*NL*
smiled
.
He
could
have
leaped
out
of
the
box
to
enfold
her
.
He
forgot
*NL*
the
need
of
circumspectness
which
his
married
state
enforced
.
He
almost
*NL*
forgot
that
he
had
with
him
in
the
box
those
who
knew
him
.
By
the
Lord
,
*NL*
he
would
have
that
lovely
girl
if
it
took
his
all
.
He
would
act
at
once
.
*NL*
This
should
be
the
end
of
Drouet
,
and
do
n't
you
forget
it
.
He
would
not
*NL*
wait
another
day
.
The
drummer
should
not
have
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
excited
that
he
could
not
stay
in
the
box
.
He
went
into
the
*NL*
lobby
,
and
then
into
the
street
,
thinking
.
Drouet
did
not
return
.
In
*NL*
a
few
minutes
the
last
act
was
over
,
and
he
was
crazy
to
have
Carrie
*NL*
alone
.
He
cursed
the
luck
that
could
keep
him
smiling
,
bowing
,
shamming
,
*NL*
when
he
wanted
to
tell
her
that
he
loved
her
,
when
he
wanted
to
whisper
*NL*
to
her
alone
.
He
groaned
as
he
saw
that
his
hopes
were
futile
.
He
must
*NL*
even
take
her
to
supper
,
shamming
.
He
finally
went
about
and
asked
how
*NL*
she
was
getting
along
.
The
actors
were
all
dressing
,
talking
,
hurrying
*NL*
about
.
Drouet
was
palavering
himself
with
the
looseness
of
excitement
*NL*
and
passion
.
The
manager
mastered
himself
only
by
a
great
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
going
to
supper
,
of
course
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
voice
that
was
a
*NL*
mockery
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Carrie
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
actress
was
in
fine
feather
.
She
was
realising
now
what
it
*NL*
was
to
be
petted
.
For
once
she
was
the
admired
,
the
sought-for
.
The
*NL*
independence
of
success
now
made
its
first
faint
showing
.
With
the
*NL*
tables
turned
,
she
was
looking
down
,
rather
than
up
,
to
her
lover
.
*NL*
She
did
not
fully
realise
that
this
was
so
,
but
there
was
something
in
*NL*
condescension
coming
from
her
which
was
infinitely
sweet
.
When
she
was
*NL*
ready
they
climbed
into
the
waiting
coach
and
drove
down
town
;
once
,
*NL*
only
,
did
she
find
an
opportunity
to
express
her
feeling
,
and
that
was
*NL*
when
the
manager
preceded
Drouet
in
the
coach
and
sat
beside
her
.
Before
*NL*
Drouet
was
fully
in
she
had
squeezed
Hurstwood
's
hand
in
a
gentle
,
*NL*
impulsive
manner
.
The
manager
was
beside
himself
with
affection
.
He
*NL*
could
have
sold
his
soul
to
be
with
her
alone
.
``
Ah
,
''
he
thought
,
``
the
*NL*
agony
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
hung
on
,
thinking
he
was
all
in
all
.
The
dinner
was
spoiled
by
*NL*
his
enthusiasm
.
Hurstwood
went
home
feeling
as
if
he
should
die
if
he
*NL*
did
not
find
affectionate
relief
.
He
whispered
``
to-morrow
''
passionately
*NL*
to
Carrie
,
and
she
understood
.
He
walked
away
from
the
drummer
and
his
*NL*
prize
at
parting
feeling
as
if
he
could
slay
him
and
not
regret
.
Carrie
*NL*
also
felt
the
misery
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
he
said
,
simulating
an
easy
friendliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
said
the
little
actress
,
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fool
!
''
he
said
,
now

to-morrow

Drouet

Chapter
XX
.
THE
LURE
OF
THE
SPIRIT
--
THE
FLESH
IN
PURSUIT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Passion
in
a
man
of
Hurstwood
's
nature
takes
a
vigorous
form
.
It
is
no
*NL*
musing
,
dreamy
thing
.
There
is
none
of
the
tendency
to
sing
outside
of
*NL*
my
lady
's
window
--
to
languish
and
repine
in
the
face
of
difficulties
.
In
*NL*
the
night
he
was
long
getting
to
sleep
because
of
too
much
thinking
,
and
*NL*
in
the
morning
he
was
early
awake
,
seizing
with
alacrity
upon
the
*NL*
same
dear
subject
and
pursuing
it
with
vigour
.
He
was
out
of
sorts
*NL*
physically
,
as
well
as
disordered
mentally
,
for
did
he
not
delight
in
a
*NL*
new
manner
in
his
Carrie
,
and
was
not
Drouet
in
the
way
?
Never
was
man
*NL*
more
harassed
than
he
by
the
thoughts
of
his
love
being
held
by
the
*NL*
elated
,
flush-mannered
drummer
.
He
would
have
given
anything
,
it
seemed
*NL*
to
him
,
to
have
the
complication
ended
--
to
have
Carrie
acquiesce
to
an
*NL*
arrangement
which
would
dispose
of
Drouet
effectually
and
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
to
do
.
He
dressed
thinking
.
He
moved
about
in
the
same
chamber
with
*NL*
his
wife
,
unmindful
of
her
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
breakfast
he
found
himself
without
an
appetite
.
The
meat
to
which
he
*NL*
helped
himself
remained
on
his
plate
untouched
.
His
coffee
grew
cold
,
*NL*
while
he
scanned
the
paper
indifferently
.
Here
and
there
he
read
a
*NL*
little
thing
,
but
remembered
nothing
.
Jessica
had
not
yet
come
down
.
*NL*
His
wife
sat
at
one
end
of
the
table
revolving
thoughts
of
her
own
in
*NL*
silence
.
A
new
servant
had
been
recently
installed
and
had
forgot
the
*NL*
napkins
.
On
this
account
the
silence
was
irritably
broken
by
a
reproof
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
told
you
about
this
before
,
Maggie
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
``
I
'm
not
*NL*
going
to
tell
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
took
a
glance
at
his
wife
.
She
was
frowning
.
Just
now
her
*NL*
manner
irritated
him
excessively
.
Her
next
remark
was
addressed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
made
up
your
mind
,
George
,
when
you
will
take
your
vacation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
customary
for
them
to
discuss
the
regular
summer
outing
at
this
*NL*
season
of
the
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'm
very
busy
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'll
want
to
make
up
your
mind
pretty
soon
,
wo
n't
you
,
if
we
're
*NL*
going
?
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
we
have
a
few
days
yet
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hmff
,
''
she
returned
.
``
Do
n't
wait
until
the
season
's
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stirred
in
aggravation
as
she
said
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
go
again
,
''
he
observed
.
``
One
would
think
I
never
did
*NL*
anything
,
the
way
you
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
want
to
know
about
it
,
''
she
reiterated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
a
few
days
yet
,
''
he
insisted
.
``
You
'll
not
want
to
start
*NL*
before
the
races
are
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
irritated
to
think
that
this
should
come
up
when
he
wished
to
*NL*
have
his
thoughts
for
other
purposes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
may
.
Jessica
does
n't
want
to
stay
until
the
end
of
the
races
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
want
with
a
season
ticket
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uh
!
''
she
said
,
using
the
sound
as
an
exclamation
of
disgust
,
``
I
'll
not
*NL*
argue
with
you
,
''
and
therewith
arose
to
leave
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
he
said
,
rising
,
putting
a
note
of
determination
in
his
voice
*NL*
which
caused
her
to
delay
her
departure
,
``
what
's
the
matter
with
you
of
*NL*
late
?
Ca
n't
I
talk
with
you
any
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
you
can
TALK
with
me
,
''
she
replied
,
laying
emphasis
on
the
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
would
n't
think
so
by
the
way
you
act
.
Now
,
you
want
to
know
*NL*
when
I
'll
be
ready
--
not
for
a
month
yet
.
Maybe
not
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
without
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
,
eh
?
''
he
sneered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
astonished
at
the
woman
's
determination
,
but
it
only
irritated
*NL*
him
the
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
'll
see
about
that
.
It
seems
to
me
you
're
trying
to
run
things
*NL*
with
a
pretty
high
hand
of
late
.
You
talk
as
though
you
settled
my
*NL*
affairs
for
me
.
Well
,
you
do
n't
.
You
do
n't
regulate
anything
that
's
*NL*
connected
with
me
.
If
you
want
to
go
,
go
,
but
you
wo
n't
hurry
me
by
any
*NL*
such
talk
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thoroughly
aroused
now
.
His
dark
eyes
snapped
,
and
he
crunched
*NL*
his
paper
as
he
laid
it
down
.
Mrs.
Hurstwood
said
nothing
more
.
He
was
*NL*
just
finishing
when
she
turned
on
her
heel
and
went
out
into
the
hall
*NL*
and
upstairs
.
He
paused
for
a
moment
,
as
if
hesitating
,
then
sat
down
*NL*
and
drank
a
little
coffee
,
and
thereafter
arose
and
went
for
his
hat
and
*NL*
gloves
upon
the
main
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
had
really
not
anticipated
a
row
of
this
character
.
She
had
*NL*
come
down
to
the
breakfast
table
feeling
a
little
out
of
sorts
with
*NL*
herself
and
revolving
a
scheme
which
she
had
in
her
mind
.
Jessica
had
*NL*
called
her
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
races
were
not
what
they
were
*NL*
supposed
to
be
.
The
social
opportunities
were
not
what
they
had
thought
*NL*
they
would
be
this
year
.
The
beautiful
girl
found
going
every
day
a
dull
*NL*
thing
.
There
was
an
earlier
exodus
this
year
of
people
who
were
anybody
*NL*
to
the
watering
places
and
Europe
.
In
her
own
circle
of
acquaintances
*NL*
several
young
men
in
whom
she
was
interested
had
gone
to
Waukesha
.
She
*NL*
began
to
feel
that
she
would
like
to
go
too
,
and
her
mother
agreed
with
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
Mrs.
Hurstwood
decided
to
broach
the
subject
.
She
was
*NL*
thinking
this
over
when
she
came
down
to
the
table
,
but
for
some
reason
*NL*
the
atmosphere
was
wrong
.
She
was
not
sure
,
after
it
was
all
over
,
just
*NL*
how
the
trouble
had
begun
.
She
was
determined
now
,
however
,
that
her
*NL*
husband
was
a
brute
,
and
that
,
under
no
circumstances
,
would
she
let
*NL*
this
go
by
unsettled
.
She
would
have
more
lady-like
treatment
or
she
*NL*
would
know
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
his
part
,
the
manager
was
loaded
with
the
care
of
this
new
argument
*NL*
until
he
reached
his
office
and
started
from
there
to
meet
Carrie
.
Then
*NL*
the
other
complications
of
love
,
desire
,
and
opposition
possessed
him
.
*NL*
His
thoughts
fled
on
before
him
upon
eagles
'
wings
.
He
could
hardly
wait
*NL*
until
he
should
meet
Carrie
face
to
face
.
What
was
the
night
,
after
all
,
*NL*
without
her
--
what
the
day
?
She
must
and
should
be
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
her
part
,
Carrie
had
experienced
a
world
of
fancy
and
feeling
*NL*
since
she
had
left
him
,
the
night
before
.
She
had
listened
to
Drouet
's
*NL*
enthusiastic
maunderings
with
much
regard
for
that
part
which
concerned
*NL*
herself
,
with
very
little
for
that
which
affected
his
own
gain
.
She
kept
*NL*
him
at
such
lengths
as
she
could
,
because
her
thoughts
were
with
her
own
*NL*
triumph
.
She
felt
Hurstwood
's
passion
as
a
delightful
background
to
her
*NL*
own
achievement
,
and
she
wondered
what
he
would
have
to
say
.
She
was
*NL*
sorry
for
him
,
too
,
with
that
peculiar
sorrow
which
finds
something
*NL*
complimentary
to
itself
in
the
misery
of
another
.
She
was
now
*NL*
experiencing
the
first
shades
of
feeling
of
that
subtle
change
which
*NL*
removes
one
out
of
the
ranks
of
the
suppliants
into
the
lines
of
the
*NL*
dispensers
of
charity
.
She
was
,
all
in
all
,
exceedingly
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
however
,
there
was
nothing
in
the
papers
concerning
the
*NL*
event
,
and
,
in
view
of
the
flow
of
common
,
everyday
things
about
,
it
now
*NL*
lost
a
shade
of
the
glow
of
the
previous
evening
.
Drouet
himself
was
*NL*
not
talking
so
much
OF
as
FOR
her
.
He
felt
instinctively
that
,
for
some
*NL*
reason
or
other
,
he
needed
reconstruction
in
her
regard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
spruced
around
their
chambers
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
preparatory
to
going
down
town
,
``
that
I
'll
straighten
out
that
*NL*
little
deal
of
mine
this
month
and
then
we
'll
get
married
.
I
was
talking
*NL*
with
Mosher
about
that
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
wo
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
was
coming
to
feel
a
certain
faint
*NL*
power
to
jest
with
the
drummer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
more
feelingly
than
usual
,
adding
,
with
the
*NL*
tone
of
one
who
pleads
,
``
Do
n't
you
believe
what
I
've
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
laughed
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
's
assurance
now
misgave
him
.
Shallow
as
was
his
mental
*NL*
observation
,
there
was
that
in
the
things
which
had
happened
which
made
*NL*
his
little
power
of
analysis
useless
.
Carrie
was
still
with
him
,
but
not
*NL*
helpless
and
pleading
.
There
was
a
lilt
in
her
voice
which
was
new
.
She
*NL*
did
not
study
him
with
eyes
expressive
of
dependence
.
The
drummer
*NL*
was
feeling
the
shadow
of
something
which
was
coming
.
It
coloured
his
*NL*
feelings
and
made
him
develop
those
little
attentions
and
say
those
*NL*
little
words
which
were
mere
forefendations
against
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
afterward
he
departed
,
and
Carrie
prepared
for
her
meeting
with
*NL*
Hurstwood
.
She
hurried
at
her
toilet
,
which
was
soon
made
,
and
hastened
*NL*
down
the
stairs
.
At
the
corner
she
passed
Drouet
,
but
they
did
not
see
*NL*
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drummer
had
forgotten
some
bills
which
he
wished
to
turn
into
his
*NL*
house
.
He
hastened
up
the
stairs
and
burst
into
the
room
,
but
found
only
*NL*
the
chambermaid
,
who
was
cleaning
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
half
to
himself
,
``
has
Carrie
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
wife
?
Yes
,
she
went
out
just
a
few
minutes
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
strange
,
''
thought
Drouet
.
``
She
did
n't
say
a
word
to
me
.
I
wonder
*NL*
where
she
went
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hastened
about
,
rummaging
in
his
valise
for
what
he
wanted
,
*NL*
and
finally
pocketing
it
.
Then
he
turned
his
attention
to
his
fair
*NL*
neighbour
,
who
was
good-looking
and
kindly
disposed
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
up
to
?
''
he
said
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
cleaning
,
''
she
replied
,
stopping
and
winding
a
dusting
towel
about
*NL*
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tired
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
very
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
show
you
something
,
''
he
said
,
affably
,
coming
over
and
taking
*NL*
out
of
his
pocket
a
little
lithographed
card
which
had
been
issued
by
*NL*
a
wholesale
tobacco
company
.
On
this
was
printed
a
picture
of
a
pretty
*NL*
girl
,
holding
a
striped
parasol
,
the
colours
of
which
could
be
changed
*NL*
by
means
of
a
revolving
disk
in
the
back
,
which
showed
red
,
yellow
,
*NL*
green
,
and
blue
through
little
interstices
made
in
the
ground
occupied
*NL*
by
the
umbrella
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
that
clever
?
''
he
said
,
handing
it
to
her
and
showing
her
how
it
*NL*
worked
.
``
You
never
saw
anything
like
that
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
nice
?
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
have
it
if
you
want
it
,
''
he
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
pretty
ring
you
have
,
''
he
said
,
touching
a
commonplace
setting
*NL*
which
adorned
the
hand
holding
the
card
he
had
given
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
he
answered
,
making
use
of
a
pretence
at
examination
to
*NL*
secure
her
finger
.
``
That
's
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ice
being
thus
broken
,
he
launched
into
further
observation
*NL*
pretending
to
forget
that
her
fingers
were
still
retained
by
his
.
She
*NL*
soon
withdrew
them
,
however
,
and
retreated
a
few
feet
to
rest
against
*NL*
the
window-sill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
see
you
for
a
long
time
,
''
she
said
,
coquettishly
,
repulsing
*NL*
one
of
his
exuberant
approaches
.
``
You
must
have
been
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
,

said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
travel
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
far
--
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
very
well
.
You
get
tired
of
it
after
a
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
travel
,
''
said
the
girl
,
gazing
idly
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
become
of
your
friend
,
Mr.
Hurstwood
?
''
she
suddenly
asked
,
*NL*
bethinking
herself
of
the
manager
,
who
,
from
her
own
observation
,
seemed
*NL*
to
contain
promising
material
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
here
in
town
.
What
makes
you
ask
about
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
only
he
has
n't
been
here
since
you
got
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
come
to
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
take
up
his
name
a
dozen
times
in
the
last
month
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
,
''
said
the
drummer
,
lightly
.
``
He
has
n't
called
more
than
half
a
*NL*
dozen
times
since
we
've
been
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
n't
,
eh
?
''
said
the
girl
,
smiling
.
``
That
's
all
you
know
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
took
on
a
slightly
more
serious
tone
.
He
was
uncertain
as
to
*NL*
whether
she
was
joking
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tease
,
''
he
said
,
``
what
makes
you
smile
that
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
him
recently
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
since
you
came
back
,
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
often
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
nearly
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
mischievous
newsmonger
,
and
was
keenly
wondering
what
the
*NL*
effect
of
her
words
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
did
he
come
to
see
?
''
asked
the
drummer
,
incredulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Drouet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
rather
foolish
at
this
answer
,
and
then
attempted
to
correct
*NL*
himself
so
as
not
to
appear
a
dupe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
what
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
replied
the
girl
,
her
head
cocked
coquettishly
on
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
an
old
friend
,
''
he
went
on
,
getting
deeper
into
the
mire
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
gone
on
further
with
his
little
flirtation
,
but
the
taste
*NL*
for
it
was
temporarily
removed
.
He
was
quite
relieved
when
the
girl
's
*NL*
named
was
called
from
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
to
go
,
''
she
said
,
moving
away
from
him
airily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
see
you
later
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
pretence
of
disturbance
at
being
*NL*
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
gone
,
he
gave
freer
play
to
his
feelings
.
His
face
,
never
*NL*
easily
controlled
by
him
,
expressed
all
the
perplexity
and
disturbance
*NL*
which
he
felt
.
Could
it
be
that
Carrie
had
received
so
many
visits
*NL*
and
yet
said
nothing
about
them
?
Was
Hurstwood
lying
?
What
did
the
*NL*
chambermaid
mean
by
it
,
anyway
?
He
had
thought
there
was
something
odd
*NL*
about
Carrie
's
manner
at
the
time
.
Why
did
she
look
so
disturbed
when
*NL*
he
had
asked
her
how
many
times
Hurstwood
had
called
?
By
George
!
He
*NL*
remembered
now
.
There
was
something
strange
about
the
whole
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
in
a
rocking-chair
to
think
the
better
,
drawing
up
one
leg
*NL*
on
his
knee
and
frowning
mightily
.
His
mind
ran
on
at
a
great
rate
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
Carrie
had
n't
acted
out
of
the
ordinary
.
It
could
n't
be
,
by
*NL*
George
,
that
she
was
deceiving
him
.
She
had
n't
acted
that
way
.
Why
,
*NL*
even
last
night
she
had
been
as
friendly
toward
him
as
could
be
,
and
*NL*
Hurstwood
too
.
Look
how
they
acted
!
He
could
hardly
believe
they
would
*NL*
try
to
deceive
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
thoughts
burst
into
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
act
sort
of
funny
at
times
.
Here
she
had
dressed
,
and
gone
out
*NL*
this
morning
and
never
said
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
scratched
his
head
and
prepared
to
go
down
town
.
He
was
still
*NL*
frowning
.
As
he
came
into
the
hall
he
encountered
the
girl
,
who
was
now
*NL*
looking
after
another
chamber
.
She
had
on
a
white
dusting
cap
,
beneath
*NL*
which
her
chubby
face
shone
good-naturedly
.
Drouet
almost
forgot
*NL*
his
worry
in
the
fact
that
she
was
smiling
on
him
.
He
put
his
hand
*NL*
familiarly
on
her
shoulder
,
as
if
only
to
greet
her
in
passing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
over
being
mad
?
''
she
said
,
still
mischievously
inclined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
mad
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quit
your
fooling
about
that
,
''
he
said
,
in
an
offhand
way
.
``
Were
you
*NL*
serious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
she
answered
.
Then
,
with
an
air
of
one
who
did
not
*NL*
intentionally
mean
to
create
trouble
,
``
He
came
lots
of
times
.
I
thought
*NL*
you
knew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
game
of
deception
was
up
with
Drouet
.
He
did
not
try
to
simulate
*NL*
indifference
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
spend
the
evenings
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
.
Sometimes
they
went
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
You
must
n't
look
so
mad
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
,
''
he
said
.
``
Did
any
one
else
see
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
the
girl
,
as
if
,
after
all
,
it
were
nothing
in
*NL*
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
ago
was
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
before
you
came
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
drummer
pinched
his
lip
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
anything
,
will
you
?
''
he
asked
,
giving
the
girl
's
arm
a
gentle
*NL*
squeeze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
''
she
returned
.
``
I
would
n't
worry
over
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
said
,
passing
on
,
seriously
brooding
for
once
,
and
yet
*NL*
not
wholly
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
he
was
making
a
most
excellent
*NL*
impression
upon
the
chambermaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
see
her
about
that
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
passionately
,
feeling
*NL*
that
he
had
been
unduly
wronged
.
``
I
'll
find
out
,
b
`
George
,
whether
*NL*
she
'll
act
that
way
or
not

Chapter
XXI

THE
LURE
OF
THE
SPIRIT
--
THE
FLESH
IN
PURSUIT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carrie
came
Hurstwood
had
been
waiting
many
minutes
.
His
blood
was
*NL*
warm
;
his
nerves
wrought
up
.
He
was
anxious
to
see
the
woman
who
had
*NL*
stirred
him
so
profoundly
the
night
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
''
he
said
,
repressedly
,
feeling
a
spring
in
his
limbs
and
*NL*
an
elation
which
was
tragic
in
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
on
as
if
bound
for
some
objective
point
,
while
Hurstwood
*NL*
drank
in
the
radiance
of
her
presence
.
The
rustle
of
her
pretty
skirt
*NL*
was
like
music
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
satisfied
?
''
he
asked
,
thinking
of
how
well
she
did
the
night
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tightened
his
fingers
as
he
saw
the
smile
she
gave
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
wonderful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
laughed
ecstatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
one
of
the
best
things
I
've
seen
in
a
long
time
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
dwelling
on
her
attractiveness
as
he
had
felt
it
the
evening
*NL*
before
,
and
mingling
it
with
the
feeling
her
presence
inspired
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
dwelling
in
the
atmosphere
which
this
man
created
for
her
.
*NL*
Already
she
was
enlivened
and
suffused
with
a
glow
.
She
felt
his
drawing
*NL*
toward
her
in
every
sound
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
were
such
nice
flowers
you
sent
me
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
moment
or
*NL*
two
.
``
They
were
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
you
liked
them
,
''
he
answered
,
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thinking
all
the
time
that
the
subject
of
his
desire
was
being
*NL*
delayed
.
He
was
anxious
to
turn
the
talk
to
his
own
feelings
.
All
was
*NL*
ripe
for
it
.
His
Carrie
was
beside
him
.
He
wanted
to
plunge
in
and
*NL*
expostulate
with
her
,
and
yet
he
found
himself
fishing
for
words
and
*NL*
feeling
for
a
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
got
home
all
right
,
''
he
said
,
gloomily
,
of
a
sudden
,
his
tune
*NL*
modifying
itself
to
one
of
self-commiseration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Carrie
,
easily
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
steadily
for
a
moment
,
slowing
his
pace
and
fixing
her
*NL*
with
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
the
flood
of
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
me
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
confused
Carrie
considerably
,
for
she
realised
the
flood-gates
*NL*
were
open
.
She
did
n't
know
exactly
what
to
answer
.
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
lower
lip
between
his
teeth
for
a
moment
,
and
then
let
it
*NL*
go
.
He
stopped
by
the
walk
side
and
kicked
the
grass
with
his
toe
.
He
*NL*
searched
her
face
with
a
tender
,
appealing
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
away
from
him
?
''
he
asked
,
intensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
returned
Carrie
,
still
illogically
drifting
and
finding
*NL*
nothing
at
which
to
catch
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
she
was
in
a
most
hopeless
quandary
.
Here
was
a
*NL*
man
whom
she
thoroughly
liked
,
who
exercised
an
influence
over
her
,
*NL*
sufficient
almost
to
delude
her
into
the
belief
that
she
was
possessed
*NL*
of
a
lively
passion
for
him
.
She
was
still
the
victim
of
his
keen
eyes
,
*NL*
his
suave
manners
,
his
fine
clothes
.
She
looked
and
saw
before
her
a
*NL*
man
who
was
most
gracious
and
sympathetic
,
who
leaned
toward
her
with
a
*NL*
feeling
that
was
a
delight
to
observe
.
She
could
not
resist
the
glow
*NL*
of
his
temperament
,
the
light
of
his
eye
.
She
could
hardly
keep
from
*NL*
feeling
what
he
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
she
was
not
without
thoughts
which
were
disturbing
.
What
did
*NL*
he
know
?
What
had
Drouet
told
him
?
Was
she
a
wife
in
his
eyes
,
or
what
?
*NL*
Would
he
marry
her
?
Even
while
he
talked
,
and
she
softened
,
and
her
eyes
*NL*
were
lighted
with
a
tender
glow
,
she
was
asking
herself
if
Drouet
*NL*
had
told
him
they
were
not
married
.
There
was
never
anything
at
all
*NL*
convincing
about
what
Drouet
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
she
was
not
grieved
at
Hurstwood
's
love
.
No
strain
of
bitterness
*NL*
was
in
it
for
her
,
whatever
he
knew
.
He
was
evidently
sincere
.
His
*NL*
passion
was
real
and
warm
.
There
was
power
in
what
he
said
.
What
should
*NL*
she
do
?
She
went
on
thinking
this
,
answering
vaguely
,
languishing
*NL*
affectionately
,
and
altogether
drifting
,
until
she
was
on
a
borderless
*NL*
sea
of
speculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
come
away
?
''
he
said
,
tenderly
.
``
I
will
arrange
for
you
*NL*
whatever
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
what
?
''
he
asked
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
look
of
confusion
and
pain
in
her
face
.
She
was
wondering
*NL*
why
that
miserable
thought
must
be
brought
in
.
She
was
struck
as
by
*NL*
a
blade
with
the
miserable
provision
which
was
outside
the
pale
of
*NL*
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
himself
realized
that
it
was
a
wretched
thing
to
have
dragged
in
.
*NL*
He
wanted
to
weigh
the
effects
of
it
,
and
yet
he
could
not
see
.
He
*NL*
went
beating
on
,
flushed
by
her
presence
,
clearly
awakened
,
intensely
*NL*
enlisted
in
his
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
?
''
he
said
,
beginning
over
and
with
a
more
reverent
*NL*
feeling
.
``
You
know
I
ca
n't
do
without
you
--
you
know
it
--
it
ca
n't
go
on
*NL*
this
way
--
can
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
ask
if
I
--
I
would
n't
argue
with
you
if
I
could
help
it
.
Look
*NL*
at
me
,
Carrie
.
Put
yourself
in
my
place
.
You
do
n't
want
to
stay
away
*NL*
from
me
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
as
if
in
deep
thought
.
``
Then
why
not
settle
the
whole
*NL*
thing
,
once
and
for
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
!
Ah
,
Carrie
,
what
makes
you
say
that
?
Do
n't
torment
me
.
Be
*NL*
serious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
said
Carrie
,
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
be
,
dearest
,
and
say
that
.
Not
when
you
know
how
I
love
you
.
*NL*
Look
at
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
manner
as
he
said
this
was
the
most
quiet
imaginable
.
His
face
and
*NL*
body
retained
utter
composure
.
Only
his
eyes
moved
,
and
they
flashed
a
*NL*
subtle
,
dissolving
fire
.
In
them
the
whole
intensity
of
the
man
's
nature
*NL*
was
distilling
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
act
this
way
,
dearest
?
''
he
inquired
,
after
a
time
.
``
You
*NL*
love
me
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
on
her
such
a
storm
of
feeling
that
she
was
overwhelmed
.
For
*NL*
the
moment
all
doubts
were
cleared
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
,
frankly
and
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
you
'll
come
,
wo
n't
you
--
come
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
shook
her
head
in
spite
of
her
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
wait
any
longer
,
''
urged
Hurstwood
.
``
If
that
is
too
soon
,
come
*NL*
Saturday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
we
be
married
?
''
she
asked
,
diffidently
,
forgetting
in
her
*NL*
difficult
situation
that
she
had
hoped
he
took
her
to
be
Drouet
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
started
,
hit
as
he
was
by
a
problem
which
was
more
difficult
*NL*
than
hers
.
He
gave
no
sign
of
the
thoughts
that
flashed
like
messages
to
*NL*
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
time
you
say
,
''
he
said
,
with
ease
,
refusing
to
discolour
his
*NL*
present
delight
with
this
miserable
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saturday
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
will
marry
me
then
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
'll
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
looked
at
his
lovely
prize
,
so
beautiful
,
so
winsome
,
so
*NL*
difficult
to
be
won
,
and
made
strange
resolutions
.
His
passion
had
*NL*
gotten
to
that
stage
now
where
it
was
no
longer
coloured
with
reason
.
He
*NL*
did
not
trouble
over
little
barriers
of
this
sort
in
the
face
of
so
much
*NL*
loveliness
.
He
would
accept
the
situation
with
all
its
difficulties
;
he
*NL*
would
not
try
to
answer
the
objections
which
cold
truth
thrust
upon
*NL*
him
.
He
would
promise
anything
,
everything
,
and
trust
to
fortune
to
*NL*
disentangle
him
.
He
would
make
a
try
for
Paradise
,
whatever
might
be
*NL*
the
result
.
He
would
be
happy
,
by
the
Lord
,
if
it
cost
all
honesty
of
*NL*
statement
,
all
abandonment
of
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
tenderly
.
She
could
have
laid
her
head
upon
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
so
delightful
did
it
all
seem
.
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
'll
try
and
*NL*
get
ready
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
looked
into
her
pretty
face
,
crossed
with
little
shadows
*NL*
of
wonder
and
misgiving
,
and
thought
he
had
never
seen
anything
more
*NL*
lovely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
see
you
again
to-morrow
,
''
he
said
,
joyously
,
``
and
we
'll
talk
over
*NL*
the
plans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
with
her
,
elated
beyond
words
,
so
delightful
had
been
the
*NL*
result
.
He
impressed
a
long
story
of
joy
and
affection
upon
her
,
though
*NL*
there
was
but
here
and
there
a
word
.
After
a
half-hour
he
began
to
*NL*
realise
that
the
meeting
must
come
to
an
end
,
so
exacting
is
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
''
he
said
at
parting
,
a
gayety
of
manner
adding
wonderfully
*NL*
to
his
brave
demeanour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Carrie
,
tripping
elatedly
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
so
much
enthusiasm
engendered
that
she
was
believing
*NL*
herself
deeply
in
love
.
She
sighed
as
she
thought
of
her
handsome
*NL*
adorer
.
Yes
,
she
would
get
ready
by
Saturday
.
She
would
go
,
and
they
*NL*
would
be
happy
.

Chapter
XXII
.
THE
BLAZE
OF
THE
TINDER
--
FLESH
WARS
WITH
THE
FLESH
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
misfortune
of
the
Hurstwood
household
was
due
to
the
fact
that
*NL*
jealousy
,
having
been
born
of
love
,
did
not
perish
with
it
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Hurstwood
retained
this
in
such
form
that
subsequent
influences
could
*NL*
transform
it
into
hate
.
Hurstwood
was
still
worthy
,
in
a
physical
sense
,
*NL*
of
the
affection
his
wife
had
once
bestowed
upon
him
,
but
in
a
social
*NL*
sense
he
fell
short
.
With
his
regard
died
his
power
to
be
attentive
to
*NL*
her
,
and
this
,
to
a
woman
,
is
much
greater
than
outright
crime
toward
*NL*
another
.
Our
self-love
dictates
our
appreciation
of
the
good
or
evil
in
*NL*
another
.
In
Mrs.
Hurstwood
it
discoloured
the
very
hue
of
her
husband
's
*NL*
indifferent
nature
.
She
saw
design
in
deeds
and
phrases
which
sprung
*NL*
only
from
a
faded
appreciation
of
her
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
consequence
,
she
was
resentful
and
suspicious
.
The
jealousy
that
*NL*
prompted
her
to
observe
every
falling
away
from
the
little
amenities
of
*NL*
the
married
relation
on
his
part
served
to
give
her
notice
of
the
*NL*
airy
grace
with
which
he
still
took
the
world
.
She
could
see
from
*NL*
the
scrupulous
care
which
he
exercised
in
the
matter
of
his
personal
*NL*
appearance
that
his
interest
in
life
had
abated
not
a
jot
.
Every
motion
,
*NL*
every
glance
had
something
in
it
of
the
pleasure
he
felt
in
Carrie
,
of
*NL*
the
zest
this
new
pursuit
of
pleasure
lent
to
his
days
.
Mrs.
Hurstwood
*NL*
felt
something
,
sniffing
change
,
as
animals
do
danger
,
afar
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
feeling
was
strengthened
by
actions
of
a
direct
and
more
potent
*NL*
nature
on
the
part
of
Hurstwood
.
We
have
seen
with
what
irritation
he
*NL*
shirked
those
little
duties
which
no
longer
contained
any
amusement
of
*NL*
satisfaction
for
him
,
and
the
open
snarls
with
which
,
more
recently
,
*NL*
he
resented
her
irritating
goads
.
These
little
rows
were
really
*NL*
precipitated
by
an
atmosphere
which
was
surcharged
with
dissension
.
That
*NL*
it
would
shower
,
with
a
sky
so
full
of
blackening
thunderclouds
,
would
*NL*
scarcely
be
thought
worthy
of
comment
.
Thus
,
after
leaving
the
breakfast
*NL*
table
this
morning
,
raging
inwardly
at
his
blank
declaration
of
*NL*
indifference
at
her
plans
,
Mrs.
Hurstwood
encountered
Jessica
in
her
*NL*
dressing-room
,
very
leisurely
arranging
her
hair
.
Hurstwood
had
already
*NL*
left
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
n't
be
so
late
coming
down
to
breakfast
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
addressing
Jessica
,
while
making
for
her
crochet
basket
.
``
Now
here
the
*NL*
things
are
quite
cold
,
and
you
have
n't
eaten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
natural
composure
was
sadly
ruffled
,
and
Jessica
was
doomed
to
feel
*NL*
the
fag
end
of
the
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
hungry
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
n't
you
say
so
,
and
let
the
girl
put
away
the
things
,
*NL*
instead
of
keeping
her
waiting
all
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
mind
,
''
answered
Jessica
,
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
,
if
she
does
n't
,
''
returned
the
mother
,
``
and
,
anyhow
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
like
you
to
talk
that
way
to
me
.
You
're
too
young
to
put
on
such
an
air
*NL*
with
your
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mamma
,
do
n't
row
,
''
;
answered
Jessica
.
``
What
's
the
matter
this
*NL*
morning
,
anyway
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
's
the
matter
,
and
I
'm
not
rowing
.
You
must
n't
think
because
I
*NL*
indulge
you
in
some
things
that
you
can
keep
everybody
waiting
.
I
wo
n't
*NL*
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
keeping
anybody
waiting
,
''
returned
Jessica
,
sharply
,
stirred
*NL*
out
of
a
cynical
indifference
to
a
sharp
defence
.
``
I
said
I
was
n't
*NL*
hungry
.
I
do
n't
want
any
breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
how
you
address
me
,
missy
.
I
'll
not
have
it
.
Hear
me
now
;
I
'll
not
*NL*
have
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jessica
heard
this
last
while
walking
out
of
the
room
,
with
a
toss
of
*NL*
her
head
and
a
flick
of
her
pretty
skirts
indicative
of
the
independence
*NL*
and
indifference
she
felt
.
She
did
not
propose
to
be
quarrelled
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
little
arguments
were
all
too
frequent
,
the
result
of
a
growth
*NL*
of
natures
which
were
largely
independent
and
selfish
.
George
,
Jr.
,
*NL*
manifested
even
greater
touchiness
and
exaggeration
in
the
matter
of
his
*NL*
individual
rights
,
and
attempted
to
make
all
feel
that
he
was
a
man
*NL*
with
a
man
's
privileges
--
an
assumption
which
,
of
all
things
,
is
most
*NL*
groundless
and
pointless
in
a
youth
of
nineteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
a
man
of
authority
and
some
fine
feeling
,
and
it
irritated
*NL*
him
excessively
to
find
himself
surrounded
more
and
more
by
a
world
upon
*NL*
which
he
had
no
hold
,
and
of
which
he
had
a
lessening
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
when
such
little
things
,
such
as
the
proposed
earlier
start
to
*NL*
Waukesha
,
came
up
,
they
made
clear
to
him
his
position
.
He
was
being
*NL*
made
to
follow
,
was
not
leading
.
When
,
in
addition
,
a
sharp
temper
was
*NL*
manifested
,
and
to
the
process
of
shouldering
him
out
of
his
authority
*NL*
was
added
a
rousing
intellectual
kick
,
such
as
a
sneer
or
a
cynical
*NL*
laugh
,
he
was
unable
to
keep
his
temper
.
He
flew
into
hardly
repressed
*NL*
passion
,
and
wished
himself
clear
of
the
whole
household
.
It
seemed
a
*NL*
most
irritating
drag
upon
all
his
desires
and
opportunities
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
this
,
he
still
retained
the
semblance
of
leadership
and
control
,
*NL*
even
though
his
wife
was
straining
to
revolt
.
Her
display
of
temper
*NL*
and
open
assertion
of
opposition
were
based
upon
nothing
more
than
the
*NL*
feeling
that
she
could
do
it
.
She
had
no
special
evidence
wherewith
to
*NL*
justify
herself
--
the
knowledge
of
something
which
would
give
her
both
*NL*
authority
and
excuse
.
The
latter
was
all
that
was
lacking
,
however
,
to
*NL*
give
a
solid
foundation
to
what
,
in
a
way
,
seemed
groundless
discontent
.
*NL*
The
clear
proof
of
one
overt
deed
was
the
cold
breath
needed
to
convert
*NL*
the
lowering
clouds
of
suspicion
into
a
rain
of
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
inkling
of
untoward
deeds
on
the
part
of
Hurstwood
had
come
.
Doctor
*NL*
Beale
,
the
handsome
resident
physician
of
the
neighbourhood
,
met
Mrs.
*NL*
Hurstwood
at
her
own
doorstep
some
days
after
Hurstwood
and
Carrie
had
*NL*
taken
the
drive
west
on
Washington
Boulevard
.
Dr.
Beale
,
coming
east
on
*NL*
the
same
drive
,
had
recognised
Hurstwood
,
but
not
before
he
was
quite
*NL*
past
him
.
He
was
not
so
sure
of
Carrie
--
did
not
know
whether
it
was
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
wife
or
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
speak
to
your
friends
when
you
meet
them
out
driving
,
do
*NL*
you
?
''
he
said
,
jocosely
,
to
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
see
them
,
I
do
.
Where
was
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
Washington
Boulevard
.
''
he
answered
,
expecting
her
eye
to
light
with
*NL*
immediate
remembrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
out
near
Hoyne
Avenue
.
You
were
with
your
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
're
mistaken
,
''
she
answered
.
Then
,
remembering
her
husband
's
*NL*
part
in
the
affair
,
she
immediately
fell
a
prey
to
a
host
of
young
*NL*
suspicions
,
of
which
,
however
,
she
gave
no
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
I
saw
your
husband
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
I
was
n't
so
sure
about
you
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
your
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
was
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
,
knowing
full
well
that
such
*NL*
was
not
the
case
,
as
Jessica
had
been
her
companion
for
weeks
.
She
had
*NL*
recovered
herself
sufficiently
to
wish
to
know
more
of
the
details
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
in
the
afternoon
?
''
she
asked
,
artfully
,
assuming
an
air
of
*NL*
acquaintanceship
with
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
about
two
or
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
have
been
Jessica
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
,
not
wishing
to
seem
to
*NL*
attach
any
importance
to
the
incident
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
physician
had
a
thought
or
two
of
his
own
,
but
dismissed
the
matter
*NL*
as
worthy
of
no
further
discussion
on
his
part
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurstwood
gave
this
bit
of
information
considerable
thought
during
*NL*
the
next
few
hours
,
and
even
days
.
She
took
it
for
granted
that
the
*NL*
doctor
had
really
seen
her
husband
,
and
that
he
had
been
riding
,
most
*NL*
likely
,
with
some
other
woman
,
after
announcing
himself
as
BUSY
to
her
.
*NL*
As
a
consequence
,
she
recalled
,
with
rising
feeling
,
how
often
he
had
*NL*
refused
to
go
to
places
with
her
,
to
share
in
little
visits
,
or
,
indeed
,
*NL*
take
part
in
any
of
the
social
amenities
which
furnished
the
diversion
*NL*
of
her
existence
.
He
had
been
seen
at
the
theatre
with
people
whom
he
*NL*
called
Moy
's
friends
;
now
he
was
seen
driving
,
and
,
most
likely
,
would
*NL*
have
an
excuse
for
that
.
Perhaps
there
were
others
of
whom
she
did
not
*NL*
hear
,
or
why
should
he
be
so
busy
,
so
indifferent
,
of
late
?
In
the
last
*NL*
six
weeks
he
had
become
strangely
irritable
--
strangely
satisfied
to
pick
*NL*
up
and
go
out
,
whether
things
were
right
or
wrong
in
the
house
.
Why
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
recalled
,
with
more
subtle
emotions
,
that
he
did
not
look
at
her
*NL*
now
with
any
of
the
old
light
of
satisfaction
or
approval
in
his
eye
.
*NL*
Evidently
,
along
with
other
things
,
he
was
taking
her
to
be
getting
old
*NL*
and
uninteresting
.
He
saw
her
wrinkles
,
perhaps
.
She
was
fading
,
while
*NL*
he
was
still
preening
himself
in
his
elegance
and
youth
.
He
was
still
an
*NL*
interested
factor
in
the
merry-makings
of
the
world
,
while
she
--
but
she
*NL*
did
not
pursue
the
thought
.
She
only
found
the
whole
situation
bitter
,
*NL*
and
hated
him
for
it
thoroughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
came
of
this
incident
at
the
time
,
for
the
truth
is
it
did
not
*NL*
seem
conclusive
enough
to
warrant
any
discussion
.
Only
the
atmosphere
of
*NL*
distrust
and
ill-feeling
was
strengthened
,
precipitating
every
now
and
*NL*
then
little
sprinklings
of
irritable
conversation
,
enlivened
by
flashes
*NL*
of
wrath
.
The
matter
of
the
Waukesha
outing
was
merely
a
continuation
of
*NL*
other
things
of
the
same
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
Carrie
's
appearance
on
the
Avery
stage
,
Mrs.
Hurstwood
*NL*
visited
the
races
with
Jessica
and
a
youth
of
her
acquaintance
,
Mr.
Bart
*NL*
Taylor
,
the
son
of
the
owner
of
a
local
house-furnishing
establishment
.
*NL*
They
had
driven
out
early
,
and
,
as
it
chanced
,
encountered
several
*NL*
friends
of
Hurstwood
,
all
Elks
,
and
two
of
whom
had
attended
the
*NL*
performance
the
evening
before
.
A
thousand
chances
the
subject
of
the
*NL*
performance
had
never
been
brought
up
had
Jessica
not
been
so
engaged
*NL*
by
the
attentions
of
her
young
companion
,
who
usurped
as
much
time
as
*NL*
possible
.
This
left
Mrs.
Hurstwood
in
the
mood
to
extend
the
perfunctory
*NL*
greetings
of
some
who
knew
her
into
short
conversations
,
and
the
short
*NL*
conversations
of
friends
into
long
ones
.
It
was
from
one
who
meant
but
*NL*
to
greet
her
perfunctorily
that
this
interesting
intelligence
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
this
individual
,
who
wore
sporting
clothes
of
the
most
*NL*
attractive
pattern
,
and
had
a
field-glass
strung
over
his
shoulder
,
*NL*
``
that
you
did
not
get
over
to
our
little
entertainment
last
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
,
inquiringly
,
and
wondering
why
he
should
*NL*
be
using
the
tone
he
did
in
noting
the
fact
that
she
had
not
been
to
*NL*
something
she
knew
nothing
about
.
It
was
on
her
lips
to
say
,
``
What
was
*NL*
it
?
''
when
he
added
,
``
I
saw
your
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
wonder
was
at
once
replaced
by
the
more
subtle
quality
of
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
cautiously
,
``
was
it
pleasant
?
He
did
not
tell
me
much
*NL*
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
.
Really
one
of
the
best
private
theatricals
I
ever
attended
.
There
*NL*
was
one
actress
who
surprised
us
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
bad
you
could
n't
have
been
there
,
really
.
I
was
sorry
to
hear
*NL*
you
were
n't
feeling
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
well
!
Mrs.
Hurstwood
could
have
echoed
the
words
after
him
*NL*
open-mouthed
.
As
it
was
,
she
extricated
herself
from
her
mingled
impulse
*NL*
to
deny
and
question
,
and
said
,
almost
raspingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
too
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looks
like
there
will
be
quite
a
crowd
here
to-day
,
does
n't
it
?
''
the
*NL*
acquaintance
observed
,
drifting
off
upon
another
topic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
's
wife
would
have
questioned
farther
,
but
she
saw
no
*NL*
opportunity
.
She
was
for
the
moment
wholly
at
sea
,
anxious
to
think
for
*NL*
herself
,
and
wondering
what
new
deception
was
this
which
caused
him
to
*NL*
give
out
that
she
was
ill
when
she
was
not
.
Another
case
of
her
company
*NL*
not
wanted
,
and
excuses
being
made
.
She
resolved
to
find
out
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
at
the
performance
last
evening
?
''
she
asked
of
the
next
of
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
friends
who
greeted
her
as
she
sat
in
her
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
You
did
n't
get
around
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
,
``
I
was
not
feeling
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
your
husband
told
me
,
''
he
answered
.
``
Well
,
it
was
really
very
*NL*
enjoyable
.
Turned
out
much
better
than
I
expected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
there
many
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
was
full
.
It
was
quite
an
Elk
night
.
I
saw
quite
a
number
of
*NL*
your
friends
--
Mrs.
Harrison
,
Mrs.
Barnes
,
Mrs.
Collins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
a
social
gathering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
it
was
.
My
wife
enjoyed
it
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurstwood
bit
her
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
she
thought
,
``
that
's
the
way
he
does
.
Tells
my
friends
I
am
sick
*NL*
and
can
not
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
what
could
induce
him
to
go
alone
.
There
was
something
back
*NL*
of
this
.
She
rummaged
her
brain
for
a
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
evening
,
when
Hurstwood
reached
home
,
she
had
brooded
herself
into
a
*NL*
state
of
sullen
desire
for
explanation
and
revenge
.
She
wanted
to
know
*NL*
what
this
peculiar
action
of
his
imported
.
She
was
certain
there
was
*NL*
more
behind
it
all
than
what
she
had
heard
,
and
evil
curiosity
mingled
*NL*
well
with
distrust
and
the
remnants
of
her
wrath
of
the
morning
.
She
,
*NL*
impending
disaster
itself
,
walked
about
with
gathered
shadow
at
the
eyes
*NL*
and
the
rudimentary
muscles
of
savagery
fixing
the
hard
lines
of
her
*NL*
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
as
we
may
well
believe
,
the
manager
came
home
in
the
*NL*
sunniest
mood
.
His
conversation
and
agreement
with
Carrie
had
raised
his
*NL*
spirits
until
he
was
in
the
frame
of
mind
of
one
who
sings
joyously
.
He
*NL*
was
proud
of
himself
,
proud
of
his
success
,
proud
of
Carrie
.
He
could
*NL*
have
been
genial
to
all
the
world
,
and
he
bore
no
grudge
against
his
*NL*
wife
.
He
meant
to
be
pleasant
,
to
forget
her
presence
,
to
live
in
the
*NL*
atmosphere
of
youth
and
pleasure
which
had
been
restored
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
now
,
the
house
,
to
his
mind
,
had
a
most
pleasing
and
comfortable
*NL*
appearance
.
In
the
hall
he
found
an
evening
paper
,
laid
there
by
the
*NL*
maid
and
forgotten
by
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
In
the
dining-room
the
table
was
*NL*
clean
laid
with
linen
and
napery
and
shiny
with
glasses
and
decorated
*NL*
china
.
Through
an
open
door
he
saw
into
the
kitchen
,
where
the
fire
was
*NL*
crackling
in
the
stove
and
the
evening
meal
already
well
under
way
.
Out
*NL*
in
the
small
back
yard
was
George
,
Jr.
,
frolicking
with
a
young
dog
he
*NL*
had
recently
purchased
,
and
in
the
parlour
Jessica
was
playing
at
the
*NL*
piano
,
the
sounds
of
a
merry
waltz
filling
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
*NL*
comfortable
home
.
Every
one
,
like
himself
,
seemed
to
have
regained
his
*NL*
good
spirits
,
to
be
in
sympathy
with
youth
and
beauty
,
to
be
inclined
to
*NL*
joy
and
merry-making
.
He
felt
as
if
he
could
say
a
good
word
all
around
*NL*
himself
,
and
took
a
most
genial
glance
at
the
spread
table
and
polished
*NL*
sideboard
before
going
upstairs
to
read
his
paper
in
the
comfortable
*NL*
armchair
of
the
sitting-room
which
looked
through
the
open
windows
into
*NL*
the
street
.
When
he
entered
there
,
however
,
he
found
his
wife
brushing
*NL*
her
hair
and
musing
to
herself
the
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
lightly
in
,
thinking
to
smooth
over
any
feeling
that
might
still
*NL*
exist
by
a
kindly
word
and
a
ready
promise
,
but
Mrs.
Hurstwood
said
*NL*
nothing
.
He
seated
himself
in
the
large
chair
,
stirred
lightly
in
making
*NL*
himself
comfortable
,
opened
his
paper
,
and
began
to
read
.
In
a
few
*NL*
moments
he
was
smiling
merrily
over
a
very
comical
account
of
a
baseball
*NL*
game
which
had
taken
place
between
the
Chicago
and
Detroit
teams
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
while
he
was
doing
this
Mrs.
Hurstwood
was
observing
him
casually
*NL*
through
the
medium
of
the
mirror
which
was
before
her
.
She
noticed
his
*NL*
pleasant
and
contented
manner
,
his
airy
grace
and
smiling
humour
,
and
it
*NL*
merely
aggravated
her
the
more
.
She
wondered
how
he
could
think
to
carry
*NL*
himself
so
in
her
presence
after
the
cynicism
,
indifference
,
and
neglect
*NL*
he
had
heretofore
manifested
and
would
continue
to
manifest
so
long
as
*NL*
she
would
endure
it
.
She
thought
how
she
should
like
to
tell
him
--
what
*NL*
stress
and
emphasis
she
would
lend
her
assertions
,
how
she
should
*NL*
drive
over
this
whole
affair
until
satisfaction
should
be
rendered
her
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
the
shining
sword
of
her
wrath
was
but
weakly
suspended
by
a
*NL*
thread
of
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
Hurstwood
encountered
a
humorous
item
concerning
*NL*
a
stranger
who
had
arrived
in
the
city
and
became
entangled
with
a
*NL*
bunco-steerer
.
It
amused
him
immensely
,
and
at
last
he
stirred
and
*NL*
chuckled
to
himself
.
He
wished
that
he
might
enlist
his
wife
's
attention
*NL*
and
read
it
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
,
ha
,
''
he
exclaimed
softly
,
as
if
to
himself
,
``
that
's
funny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurstwood
kept
on
arranging
her
hair
,
not
so
much
as
deigning
a
*NL*
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stirred
again
and
went
on
to
another
subject
.
At
last
he
felt
as
if
*NL*
his
good-humour
must
find
some
outlet
.
Julia
was
probably
still
out
*NL*
of
humour
over
that
affair
of
this
morning
,
but
that
could
easily
be
*NL*
straightened
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
she
was
in
the
wrong
,
but
he
did
n't
*NL*
care
.
She
could
go
to
Waukesha
right
away
if
she
wanted
to
.
The
sooner
*NL*
the
better
.
He
would
tell
her
that
as
soon
as
he
got
a
chance
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
thing
would
blow
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
notice
,
''
he
said
,
at
last
,
breaking
forth
concerning
another
*NL*
item
which
he
had
found
,
``
that
they
have
entered
suit
to
compel
the
*NL*
Illinois
Central
to
get
off
the
lake
front
,
Julia
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
scarcely
force
herself
to
answer
,
but
managed
to
say
``
No
,
''
*NL*
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
pricked
up
his
ears
.
There
was
a
note
in
her
voice
which
*NL*
vibrated
keenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
good
thing
if
they
did
,
''
he
went
on
,
half
to
himself
,
*NL*
half
to
her
,
though
he
felt
that
something
was
amiss
in
that
quarter
.
*NL*
He
withdrew
his
attention
to
his
paper
very
circumspectly
,
listening
*NL*
mentally
for
the
little
sounds
which
should
show
him
what
was
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
no
man
as
clever
as
Hurstwood
--
as
observant
and
*NL*
sensitive
to
atmospheres
of
many
sorts
,
particularly
upon
his
own
plane
*NL*
of
thought
--
would
have
made
the
mistake
which
he
did
in
regard
to
his
*NL*
wife
,
wrought
up
as
she
was
,
had
he
not
been
occupied
mentally
with
*NL*
a
very
different
train
of
thought
.
Had
not
the
influence
of
Carrie
's
*NL*
regard
for
him
,
the
elation
which
her
promise
aroused
in
him
,
lasted
*NL*
over
,
he
would
not
have
seen
the
house
in
so
pleasant
a
mood
.
It
was
not
*NL*
extraordinarily
bright
and
merry
this
evening
.
He
was
merely
very
much
*NL*
mistaken
,
and
would
have
been
much
more
fitted
to
cope
with
it
had
he
*NL*
come
home
in
his
normal
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
studied
his
paper
a
few
moments
longer
,
he
felt
that
he
*NL*
ought
to
modify
matters
in
some
way
or
other
.
Evidently
his
wife
was
not
*NL*
going
to
patch
up
peace
at
a
word
.
So
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
George
get
the
dog
he
has
there
in
the
yard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
snapped
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
paper
down
on
his
knees
and
gazed
idly
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
He
did
not
propose
to
lose
his
temper
,
but
merely
to
be
persistent
and
*NL*
agreeable
,
and
by
a
few
questions
bring
around
a
mild
understanding
of
*NL*
some
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
feel
so
bad
about
that
affair
of
this
morning
?
''
he
said
,
at
*NL*
last
.
``
We
need
n't
quarrel
about
that
.
You
know
you
can
go
to
Waukesha
if
*NL*
you
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
can
stay
here
and
trifle
around
with
some
one
else
?
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
turning
to
him
a
determined
countenance
upon
which
was
drawn
*NL*
a
sharp
and
wrathful
sneer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
as
if
slapped
in
the
face
.
In
an
instant
his
persuasive
,
*NL*
conciliatory
manner
fled
.
He
was
on
the
defensive
at
a
wink
and
puzzled
*NL*
for
a
word
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
he
said
at
last
,
straightening
himself
and
gazing
at
*NL*
the
cold
,
determined
figure
before
him
,
who
paid
no
attention
,
but
went
*NL*
on
arranging
herself
before
the
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
I
mean
,
''
she
said
,
finally
,
as
if
there
were
a
world
of
*NL*
information
which
she
held
in
reserve
--
which
she
did
not
need
to
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
,
''
he
said
,
stubbornly
,
yet
nervous
and
alert
for
what
*NL*
should
come
next
.
The
finality
of
the
woman
's
manner
took
away
his
*NL*
feeling
of
superiority
in
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hmph
!
''
he
murmured
,
with
a
movement
of
his
head
to
one
side
.
It
was
the
*NL*
weakest
thing
he
had
ever
done
.
It
was
totally
unassured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurstwood
noticed
the
lack
of
colour
in
it
.
She
turned
upon
him
,
*NL*
animal-like
,
able
to
strike
an
effectual
second
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
the
Waukesha
money
to-morrow
morning
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
in
amazement
.
Never
before
had
he
seen
such
a
cold
,
*NL*
steely
determination
in
her
eye
--
such
a
cruel
look
of
indifference
.
*NL*
She
seemed
a
thorough
master
of
her
mood
--
thoroughly
confident
and
*NL*
determined
to
wrest
all
control
from
him
.
He
felt
that
all
his
resources
*NL*
could
not
defend
him
.
He
must
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
he
said
,
jumping
up
.
``
You
want
!
I
'd
like
to
know
*NL*
what
's
got
into
you
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
's
GOT
into
me
,
''
she
said
,
flaming
.
``
I
want
that
money
.
You
can
*NL*
do
your
swaggering
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Swaggering
,
eh
!
What
!
You
'll
get
nothing
from
me
.
What
do
you
mean
by
*NL*
your
insinuations
,
anyhow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
were
you
last
night
?
''
she
answered
.
The
words
were
hot
as
they
*NL*
came
.
``
Who
were
you
driving
with
on
Washington
Boulevard
?
Who
were
you
*NL*
with
at
the
theatre
when
George
saw
you
?
Do
you
think
I
'm
a
fool
to
*NL*
be
duped
by
you
?
Do
you
think
I
'll
sit
at
home
here
and
take
your
`
too
*NL*
busys
'
and
`
ca
n't
come
,
'
while
you
parade
around
and
make
out
that
I
'm
*NL*
unable
to
come
?
I
want
you
to
know
that
lordly
airs
have
come
to
an
end
*NL*
so
far
as
I
am
concerned
.
You
ca
n't
dictate
to
me
nor
my
children
.
I
'm
*NL*
through
with
you
entirely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lie
,
''
he
said
,
driven
to
a
corner
and
knowing
no
other
excuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lie
,
eh
!
''
she
said
,
fiercely
,
but
with
returning
reserve
;
``
you
may
call
*NL*
it
a
lie
if
you
want
to
,
but
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lie
,
I
tell
you
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
low
,
sharp
voice
.
``
You
've
been
*NL*
searching
around
for
some
cheap
accusation
for
months
and
now
you
think
*NL*
you
have
it
.
You
think
you
'll
spring
something
and
get
the
upper
hand
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
tell
you
,
you
ca
n't
.
As
long
as
I
'm
in
this
house
I
'm
master
of
*NL*
it
,
and
you
or
any
one
else
wo
n't
dictate
to
me
--
do
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
crept
toward
her
with
a
light
in
his
eye
that
was
ominous
.
Something
*NL*
in
the
woman
's
cool
,
cynical
,
upper-handish
manner
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
already
master
,
caused
him
to
feel
for
the
moment
as
if
he
could
*NL*
strangle
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
at
him
--
a
pythoness
in
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
dictating
to
you
,
''
she
returned
;
``
I
'm
telling
you
what
I
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
answer
was
so
cool
,
so
rich
in
bravado
,
that
somehow
it
took
the
*NL*
wind
out
of
his
sails
.
He
could
not
attack
her
,
he
could
not
ask
her
*NL*
for
proofs
.
Somehow
he
felt
evidence
,
law
,
the
remembrance
of
all
his
*NL*
property
which
she
held
in
her
name
,
to
be
shining
in
her
glance
.
He
*NL*
was
like
a
vessel
,
powerful
and
dangerous
,
but
rolling
and
floundering
*NL*
without
sail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'm
telling
you
,
''
he
said
in
the
end
,
slightly
recovering
himself
,
*NL*
``
what
you
'll
not
get
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
see
about
it
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'll
find
out
what
my
rights
are
.
*NL*
Perhaps
you
'll
talk
to
a
lawyer
,
if
you
wo
n't
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
magnificent
play
,
and
had
its
effect
.
Hurstwood
fell
back
*NL*
beaten
.
He
knew
now
that
he
had
more
than
mere
bluff
to
contend
with
.
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
a
dull
proposition
.
What
to
say
*NL*
he
hardly
knew
.
All
the
merriment
had
gone
out
of
the
day
.
He
was
*NL*
disturbed
,
wretched
,
resentful
.
What
should
he
do
?
``
Do
as
you
please
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
at
last
.
``
I
'll
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
,
''
and
out
he
*NL*
strode

Chapter
XXIII

A
SPIRIT
IN
TRAVAIL
--
ONE
RUNG
PUT
BEHIND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carrie
reached
her
own
room
she
had
already
fallen
a
prey
to
those
*NL*
doubts
and
misgivings
which
are
ever
the
result
of
a
lack
of
decision
.
*NL*
She
could
not
persuade
herself
as
to
the
advisability
of
her
promise
,
or
*NL*
that
now
,
having
given
her
word
,
she
ought
to
keep
it
.
She
went
over
the
*NL*
whole
ground
in
Hurstwood
's
absence
,
and
discovered
little
objections
*NL*
that
had
not
occurred
to
her
in
the
warmth
of
the
manager
's
argument
.
*NL*
She
saw
where
she
had
put
herself
in
a
peculiar
light
,
namely
,
that
*NL*
of
agreeing
to
marry
when
she
was
already
supposedly
married
.
She
*NL*
remembered
a
few
things
Drouet
had
done
,
and
now
that
it
came
to
walking
*NL*
away
from
him
without
a
word
,
she
felt
as
if
she
were
doing
wrong
.
Now
,
*NL*
she
was
comfortably
situated
,
and
to
one
who
is
more
or
less
afraid
*NL*
of
the
world
,
this
is
an
urgent
matter
,
and
one
which
puts
up
strange
,
*NL*
uncanny
arguments
.
``
You
do
not
know
what
will
come
.
There
are
miserable
*NL*
things
outside
.
People
go
a-begging
.
Women
are
wretched
.
You
never
can
*NL*
tell
what
will
happen
.
Remember
the
time
you
were
hungry
.
Stick
to
what
*NL*
you
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Curiously
,
for
all
her
leaning
towards
Hurstwood
,
he
had
not
taken
a
*NL*
firm
hold
on
her
understanding
.
She
was
listening
,
smiling
,
approving
,
*NL*
and
yet
not
finally
agreeing
.
This
was
due
to
a
lack
of
power
on
his
*NL*
part
,
a
lack
of
that
majesty
of
passion
that
sweeps
the
mind
from
its
*NL*
seat
,
fuses
and
melts
all
arguments
and
theories
into
a
tangled
mass
,
*NL*
and
destroys
for
the
time
being
the
reasoning
power
.
This
majesty
of
*NL*
passion
is
possessed
by
nearly
every
man
once
in
his
life
,
but
it
is
*NL*
usually
an
attribute
of
youth
and
conduces
to
the
first
successful
*NL*
mating
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
being
an
older
man
,
could
scarcely
be
said
to
retain
the
fire
*NL*
of
youth
,
though
he
did
possess
a
passion
warm
and
unreasoning
.
It
was
*NL*
strong
enough
to
induce
the
leaning
toward
him
which
,
on
Carrie
's
part
,
*NL*
we
have
seen
.
She
might
have
been
said
to
be
imagining
herself
in
love
,
*NL*
when
she
was
not
.
Women
frequently
do
this
.
It
flows
from
the
fact
that
*NL*
in
each
exists
a
bias
toward
affection
,
a
craving
for
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
being
loved
.
The
longing
to
be
shielded
,
bettered
,
sympathised
with
,
*NL*
is
one
of
the
attributes
of
the
sex
.
This
,
coupled
with
sentiment
and
*NL*
a
natural
tendency
to
emotion
,
often
makes
refusing
difficult
.
It
*NL*
persuades
them
that
they
are
in
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
at
home
,
she
changed
her
clothes
and
straightened
the
rooms
for
*NL*
herself
.
In
the
matter
of
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture
she
never
*NL*
took
the
housemaid
's
opinion
.
That
young
woman
invariably
put
one
of
*NL*
the
rocking-chairs
in
the
corner
,
and
Carrie
as
regularly
moved
it
out
.
*NL*
To-day
she
hardly
noticed
that
it
was
in
the
wrong
place
,
so
absorbed
*NL*
was
she
in
her
own
thoughts
.
She
worked
about
the
room
until
Drouet
put
*NL*
in
appearance
at
five
o'clock
.
The
drummer
was
flushed
and
excited
and
*NL*
full
of
determination
to
know
all
about
her
relations
with
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
after
going
over
the
subject
in
his
mind
the
livelong
day
,
*NL*
he
was
rather
weary
of
it
and
wished
it
over
with
.
He
did
not
foresee
*NL*
serious
consequences
of
any
sort
,
and
yet
he
rather
hesitated
to
begin
.
*NL*
Carrie
was
sitting
by
the
window
when
he
came
in
,
rocking
and
looking
*NL*
out
.
``
Well
,
''
she
said
innocently
,
weary
of
her
own
mental
discussion
*NL*
and
wondering
at
his
haste
and
ill-concealed
excitement
,
``
what
makes
you
*NL*
hurry
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
hesitated
,
now
that
he
was
in
her
presence
,
uncertain
as
to
what
*NL*
course
to
pursue
.
He
was
no
diplomat
.
He
could
neither
read
nor
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
get
home
?
''
he
asked
foolishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
an
hour
or
so
ago
.
What
makes
you
ask
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
n't
here
,
''
he
said
,
``
when
I
came
back
this
morning
,
and
I
*NL*
thought
you
had
gone
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
did
,
''
said
Carrie
simply
.
``
I
went
for
a
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
looked
at
her
wonderingly
.
For
all
his
lack
of
dignity
in
such
*NL*
matters
he
did
not
know
how
to
begin
.
He
stared
at
her
in
the
most
*NL*
flagrant
manner
until
at
last
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
stare
at
me
so
?
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
was
just
thinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
thinking
what
?
''
she
returned
smilingly
,
puzzled
by
his
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
--
nothing
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
what
makes
you
look
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
was
standing
by
the
dresser
,
gazing
at
her
in
a
comic
manner
.
He
*NL*
had
laid
off
his
hat
and
gloves
and
was
now
fidgeting
with
the
little
*NL*
toilet
pieces
which
were
nearest
him
.
He
hesitated
to
believe
that
the
*NL*
pretty
woman
before
him
was
involved
in
anything
so
unsatisfactory
to
*NL*
himself
.
He
was
very
much
inclined
to
feel
that
it
was
all
right
,
after
*NL*
all
.
Yet
the
knowledge
imparted
to
him
by
the
chambermaid
was
rankling
*NL*
in
his
mind
.
He
wanted
to
plunge
in
with
a
straight
remark
of
some
sort
,
*NL*
but
he
knew
not
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
go
this
morning
?
''
he
finally
asked
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
went
for
a
walk
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
you
did
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
what
makes
you
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
beginning
to
see
now
that
he
knew
something
.
Instantly
she
drew
*NL*
herself
into
a
more
reserved
position
.
Her
cheeks
blanched
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
maybe
you
did
n't
,
''
he
said
,
beating
about
the
bush
in
the
*NL*
most
useless
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
gazed
at
him
,
and
as
she
did
so
her
ebbing
courage
halted
.
*NL*
She
saw
that
he
himself
was
hesitating
,
and
with
a
woman
's
intuition
*NL*
realised
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
great
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
talk
like
that
?
''
she
asked
,
wrinkling
her
pretty
*NL*
forehead
.
``
You
act
so
funny
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
funny
,
''
he
answered
.
They
looked
at
one
another
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
and
then
Drouet
plunged
desperately
into
his
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
about
you
and
Hurstwood
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
and
Hurstwood
--
what
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
he
come
here
a
dozen
times
while
I
was
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
dozen
times
,
''
repeated
Carrie
,
guiltily
.
``
No
,
but
what
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
said
that
you
went
out
riding
with
him
and
that
he
came
here
*NL*
every
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
such
thing
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
``
It
is
n't
true
.
Who
told
you
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
flushing
scarlet
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
,
but
Drouet
did
not
*NL*
catch
the
full
hue
of
her
face
,
owing
to
the
modified
light
of
the
*NL*
room
.
He
was
regaining
much
confidence
as
Carrie
defended
herself
with
*NL*
denials
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
some
one
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
're
sure
you
did
n't
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
You
know
how
often
he
came
.

*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
paused
for
a
moment
and
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
you
told
me
,
''
he
said
finally
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
nervously
about
,
while
Carrie
looked
at
him
confusedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
know
that
I
did
n't
tell
you
any
such
thing
as
that
,
''
said
*NL*
Carrie
,
recovering
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
you
,
''
went
on
Drouet
,
ignoring
her
last
remark
,
``
I
would
n't
*NL*
have
anything
to
do
with
him
.
He
's
a
married
man
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
--
who
is
?
''
said
Carrie
,
stumbling
at
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Hurstwood
,
''
said
Drouet
,
noting
the
effect
and
feeling
that
he
was
*NL*
delivering
a
telling
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurstwood
!
''
exclaimed
Carrie
,
rising
.
Her
face
had
changed
several
*NL*
shades
since
this
announcement
was
made
.
She
looked
within
and
without
*NL*
herself
in
a
half-dazed
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
this
?
''
she
asked
,
forgetting
that
her
interest
was
out
of
*NL*
order
and
exceedingly
incriminating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
know
it
.
I
've
always
known
it
,
''
said
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
feeling
about
for
a
right
thought
.
She
was
making
a
most
*NL*
miserable
showing
,
and
yet
feelings
were
generating
within
her
which
*NL*
were
anything
but
crumbling
cowardice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
told
you
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
did
n't
,
''
she
contradicted
,
suddenly
recovering
her
voice
.
``
You
*NL*
did
n't
do
anything
of
the
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
listened
to
her
in
astonishment
.
This
was
something
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
did
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
around
her
very
solemnly
,
and
then
went
over
to
the
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
n't
to
have
had
anything
to
do
with
him
,
''
said
Drouet
in
an
*NL*
injured
tone
,
``
after
all
I
've
done
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
you
!
What
have
you
done
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
little
brain
had
been
surging
with
contradictory
feelings
--
shame
at
*NL*
exposure
,
shame
at
Hurstwood
's
perfidy
,
anger
at
Drouet
's
deception
,
the
*NL*
mockery
he
had
made
at
her
.
Now
one
clear
idea
came
into
her
head
.
He
*NL*
was
at
fault
.
There
was
no
doubt
about
it
.
Why
did
he
bring
Hurstwood
*NL*
out
--
Hurstwood
,
a
married
man
,
and
never
say
a
word
to
her
?
Never
mind
*NL*
now
about
Hurstwood
's
perfidy
--
why
had
he
done
this
?
Why
had
n't
he
*NL*
warned
her
?
There
he
stood
now
,
guilty
of
this
miserable
breach
of
*NL*
confidence
and
talking
about
what
he
had
done
for
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
like
that
,
''
exclaimed
Drouet
,
little
realising
the
fire
his
*NL*
remark
had
generated
.
``
I
think
I
've
done
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
,
eh
?
''
she
answered
.
``
You
've
deceived
me
--
that
's
what
you
've
*NL*
done
.
You
've
brought
your
old
friends
out
here
under
false
pretences
.
*NL*
You
've
made
me
out
to
be
--
Oh
,
''
and
with
this
her
voice
broke
and
she
*NL*
pressed
her
two
little
hands
together
tragically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
what
that
's
got
to
do
with
it
,
''
said
the
drummer
quaintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
,
recovering
herself
and
shutting
her
teeth
.
``
No
,
of
*NL*
course
you
do
n't
see
.
There
is
n't
anything
you
see
.
You
could
n't
have
*NL*
told
me
in
the
first
place
,
could
you
?
You
had
to
make
me
out
*NL*
wrong
until
it
was
too
late
.
Now
you
come
sneaking
around
with
your
*NL*
information
and
your
talk
about
what
you
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
had
never
suspected
this
side
of
Carrie
's
nature
.
She
was
alive
*NL*
with
feeling
,
her
eyes
snapping
,
her
lips
quivering
,
her
whole
body
*NL*
sensible
of
the
injury
she
felt
,
and
partaking
of
her
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
sneaking
?
''
he
asked
,
mildly
conscious
of
error
on
his
part
,
but
*NL*
certain
that
he
was
wronged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
,
''
stamped
Carrie
.
``
You
're
a
horrid
,
conceited
coward
,
that
's
*NL*
what
you
are
.
If
you
had
any
sense
of
manhood
in
you
,
you
would
n't
have
*NL*
thought
of
doing
any
such
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
drummer
stared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
a
coward
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
do
you
mean
by
going
with
other
men
,
*NL*
anyway
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Other
men
!
''
exclaimed
Carrie
.
``
Other
men
--
you
know
better
than
that
.
I
*NL*
did
go
with
Mr.
Hurstwood
,
but
whose
fault
was
it
?
Did
n't
you
bring
him
*NL*
here
?
You
told
him
yourself
that
he
should
come
out
here
and
take
me
*NL*
out
.
Now
,
after
it
's
all
over
,
you
come
and
tell
me
that
I
ought
n't
to
*NL*
go
with
him
and
that
he
's
a
married
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
at
the
sound
of
the
last
two
words
and
wrung
her
hands
.
The
*NL*
knowledge
of
Hurstwood
's
perfidy
wounded
her
like
a
knife
.
``
Oh
,
''
she
*NL*
sobbed
,
repressing
herself
wonderfully
and
keeping
her
eyes
dry
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
n't
think
you
'd
be
running
around
with
him
when
I
was
away
,
''
*NL*
insisted
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
think
!
''
said
Carrie
,
now
angered
to
the
core
by
the
man
's
*NL*
peculiar
attitude
.
``
Of
course
not
.
You
thought
only
of
what
would
be
*NL*
to
your
satisfaction
.
You
thought
you
'd
make
a
toy
of
me
--
a
plaything
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
'll
show
you
that
you
wo
n't
.
I
'll
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
*NL*
you
at
all
.
You
can
take
your
old
things
and
keep
them
,
''
and
unfastening
*NL*
a
little
pin
he
had
given
her
,
she
flung
it
vigorously
upon
the
floor
*NL*
and
began
to
move
about
as
if
to
gather
up
the
things
which
belonged
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
Drouet
was
not
only
irritated
but
fascinated
the
more
.
He
looked
*NL*
at
her
in
amazement
,
and
finally
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
where
your
wrath
comes
in
.
I
've
got
the
right
of
this
*NL*
thing
.
You
ought
n't
to
have
done
anything
that
was
n't
right
after
all
I
*NL*
did
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
for
me
?
''
asked
Carrie
blazing
,
her
head
thrown
back
*NL*
and
her
lips
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
've
done
a
good
deal
,
''
said
the
drummer
,
looking
around
.
*NL*
``
I
've
given
you
all
the
clothes
you
wanted
,
have
n't
I
?
I
've
taken
you
*NL*
everywhere
you
wanted
to
go
.
You
've
had
as
much
as
I
've
had
,
and
more
*NL*
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
not
ungrateful
,
whatever
else
might
be
said
of
her
.
In
so
*NL*
far
as
her
mind
could
construe
,
she
acknowledged
benefits
received
.
She
*NL*
hardly
knew
how
to
answer
this
,
and
yet
her
wrath
was
not
placated
.
She
*NL*
felt
that
the
drummer
had
injured
her
irreparably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
ask
you
to
?
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
it
,
''
said
Drouet
,
``
and
you
took
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
talk
as
though
I
had
persuaded
you
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
``
You
stand
*NL*
there
and
throw
up
what
you
've
done
.
I
do
n't
want
your
old
things
.
I
'll
*NL*
not
have
them
.
You
take
them
to-night
and
do
what
you
please
with
them
.
*NL*
I
'll
not
stay
here
another
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nice
!
''
he
answered
,
becoming
angered
now
at
the
sense
of
his
own
*NL*
approaching
loss
.
``
Use
everything
and
abuse
me
and
then
walk
off
.
That
's
*NL*
just
like
a
woman
.
I
take
you
when
you
have
n't
got
anything
,
and
then
*NL*
when
some
one
else
comes
along
,
why
I
'm
no
good
.
I
always
thought
it
'd
*NL*
come
out
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
really
hurt
as
he
thought
of
his
treatment
,
and
looked
as
if
he
*NL*
saw
no
way
of
obtaining
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
so
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
and
I
'm
not
going
with
anybody
else
.
You
*NL*
have
been
as
miserable
and
inconsiderate
as
you
can
be
.
I
hate
you
,
I
*NL*
tell
you
,
and
I
would
n't
live
with
you
another
minute
.
You
're
a
big
,
*NL*
insulting
''
--
here
she
hesitated
and
used
no
word
at
all
--
``
or
you
would
n't
*NL*
talk
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
secured
her
hat
and
jacket
and
slipped
the
latter
on
over
her
*NL*
little
evening
dress
.
Some
wisps
of
wavy
hair
had
loosened
from
the
*NL*
bands
at
the
side
of
her
head
and
were
straggling
over
her
hot
,
red
*NL*
cheeks
.
She
was
angry
,
mortified
,
grief-stricken
.
Her
large
eyes
were
*NL*
full
of
the
anguish
of
tears
,
but
her
lids
were
not
yet
wet
.
She
was
*NL*
distracted
and
uncertain
,
deciding
and
doing
things
without
an
aim
or
*NL*
conclusion
,
and
she
had
not
the
slightest
conception
of
how
the
whole
*NL*
difficulty
would
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
a
fine
finish
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
Pack
up
and
pull
out
,
eh
?
*NL*
You
take
the
cake
.
I
bet
you
were
knocking
around
with
Hurstwood
or
you
*NL*
would
n't
act
like
that
.
I
do
n't
want
the
old
rooms
.
You
need
n't
pull
out
*NL*
for
me
.
You
can
have
them
for
all
I
care
,
but
b
`
George
,
you
have
n't
done
*NL*
me
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
not
live
with
you
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
live
with
you
.
*NL*
You
've
done
nothing
but
brag
around
ever
since
you
've
been
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
,
I
have
n't
anything
of
the
kind
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
walked
over
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
he
said
,
stepping
over
and
heading
her
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
out
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
above
all
,
sympathetic
,
and
the
sight
of
Carrie
wandering
out
,
*NL*
he
knew
not
where
,
affected
him
,
despite
his
grievance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
merely
pulled
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strain
of
the
situation
was
too
much
for
her
,
however
.
She
made
one
*NL*
more
vain
effort
and
then
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
be
reasonable
,
Cad
,
''
said
Drouet
gently
.
``
What
do
you
want
to
rush
*NL*
out
for
this
way
?
You
have
n't
any
place
to
go
.
Why
not
stay
here
now
and
*NL*
be
quiet
?
I
'll
not
bother
you
.
I
do
n't
want
to
stay
here
any
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
gone
sobbing
from
the
door
to
the
window
.
She
was
so
overcome
*NL*
she
could
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
reasonable
now
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
hold
you
.
You
can
go
if
*NL*
you
want
to
,
but
why
do
n't
you
think
it
over
?
Lord
knows
,
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
stop
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
received
no
answer
.
Carrie
was
quieting
,
however
,
under
the
influence
*NL*
of
his
plea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stay
here
now
,
and
I
'll
go
,
''
he
added
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
listened
to
this
with
mingled
feelings
.
Her
mind
was
shaken
loose
*NL*
from
the
little
mooring
of
logic
that
it
had
.
She
was
stirred
by
this
*NL*
thought
,
angered
by
that
--
her
own
injustice
,
Hurstwood
's
,
Drouet
's
,
*NL*
their
respective
qualities
of
kindness
and
favour
,
the
threat
of
the
*NL*
world
outside
,
in
which
she
had
failed
once
before
,
the
impossibility
*NL*
of
this
state
inside
,
where
the
chambers
were
no
longer
justly
hers
,
the
*NL*
effect
of
the
argument
upon
her
nerves
,
all
combined
to
make
her
a
mass
*NL*
of
jangling
fibres
--
an
anchorless
,
storm-beaten
little
craft
which
could
*NL*
do
absolutely
nothing
but
drift
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
said
Drouet
,
coming
over
to
her
after
a
few
moments
,
with
a
new
*NL*
idea
,
and
putting
his
hand
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
!
''
said
Carrie
,
drawing
away
,
but
not
removing
her
handkerchief
*NL*
from
her
eyes
.
``
Never
mind
about
this
quarrel
now
.
Let
it
go
.
You
stay
*NL*
here
until
the
month
's
out
,
anyhow
,
and
then
you
can
tell
better
what
*NL*
you
want
to
do
.
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
do
that
,
''
he
said
.
``
There
's
no
use
your
packing
up
now
.
*NL*
You
ca
n't
go
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
he
got
nothing
for
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'll
do
that
,
we
'll
call
it
off
for
the
present
and
I
'll
get
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
lowered
her
handkerchief
slightly
and
looked
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
do
that
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
?
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
only
looked
vaguely
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
!
come
on
,
''
he
said
,
``
tell
me
.
Will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
softly
,
forced
to
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
me
you
'll
do
that
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
we
'll
quit
talking
about
it
.
*NL*
It
'll
be
the
best
thing
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
heard
him
,
but
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
answer
reasonably
.
*NL*
She
felt
that
the
man
was
gentle
,
and
that
his
interest
in
her
had
*NL*
not
abated
,
and
it
made
her
suffer
a
pang
of
regret
.
She
was
in
a
most
*NL*
helpless
plight
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Drouet
,
his
attitude
had
been
that
of
the
jealous
lover
.
Now
his
*NL*
feelings
were
a
mixture
of
anger
at
deception
,
sorrow
at
losing
Carrie
,
*NL*
misery
at
being
defeated
.
He
wanted
his
rights
in
some
way
or
other
,
and
*NL*
yet
his
rights
included
the
retaining
of
Carrie
,
the
making
her
feel
her
*NL*
error
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
?
''
he
urged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
see
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
left
the
matter
as
open
as
before
,
but
it
was
something
.
It
looked
*NL*
as
if
the
quarrel
would
blow
over
,
if
they
could
only
get
some
way
of
*NL*
talking
to
one
another
.
Carrie
was
ashamed
,
and
Drouet
aggrieved
.
He
*NL*
pretended
to
take
up
the
task
of
packing
some
things
in
a
valise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
Carrie
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
,
certain
sound
*NL*
thoughts
came
into
her
head
.
He
had
erred
,
true
,
but
what
had
she
done
?
*NL*
He
was
kindly
and
good-natured
for
all
his
egotism
.
Throughout
this
*NL*
argument
he
had
said
nothing
very
harsh
.
On
the
other
hand
,
there
*NL*
was
Hurstwood
--
a
greater
deceiver
than
he
.
He
had
pretended
all
this
*NL*
affection
,
all
this
passion
,
and
he
was
lying
to
her
all
the
while
.
Oh
,
*NL*
the
perfidy
of
men
!
And
she
had
loved
him
.
There
could
be
nothing
more
*NL*
in
that
quarter
.
She
would
see
Hurstwood
no
more
.
She
would
write
him
*NL*
and
let
him
know
what
she
thought
.
Thereupon
what
would
she
do
?
Here
*NL*
were
these
rooms
.
Here
was
Drouet
,
pleading
for
her
to
remain
.
Evidently
*NL*
things
could
go
on
here
somewhat
as
before
,
if
all
were
arranged
.
It
*NL*
would
be
better
than
the
street
,
without
a
place
to
lay
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
she
thought
of
as
Drouet
rummaged
the
drawers
for
collars
and
*NL*
laboured
long
and
painstakingly
at
finding
a
shirt-stud
.
He
was
in
no
*NL*
hurry
to
rush
this
matter
.
He
felt
an
attraction
to
Carrie
which
would
*NL*
not
down
.
He
could
not
think
that
the
thing
would
end
by
his
walking
out
*NL*
of
the
room
.
There
must
be
some
way
round
,
some
way
to
make
her
own
up
*NL*
that
he
was
right
and
she
was
wrong
--
to
patch
up
a
peace
and
shut
*NL*
out
Hurstwood
for
ever
.
Mercy
,
how
he
turned
at
the
man
's
shameless
*NL*
duplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
few
moments
'
silence
,
``
that
you
'll
try
*NL*
and
get
on
the
stage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
wondering
what
she
was
intending
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
I
'll
do
yet
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
,
maybe
I
can
help
you
.
I
've
got
a
lot
of
friends
in
that
*NL*
line
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
answer
to
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
and
try
to
knock
around
now
without
any
money
.
Let
me
help
*NL*
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
no
easy
thing
to
go
on
your
own
hook
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
only
rocked
back
and
forth
in
her
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
go
up
against
a
hard
game
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bestirred
himself
about
some
other
details
and
Carrie
rocked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
tell
me
all
about
this
thing
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
time
,
*NL*
``
and
let
's
call
it
off
?
You
do
n't
really
care
for
Hurstwood
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
want
to
start
on
that
again
?
''
said
Carrie
.
``
You
were
to
*NL*
blame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
was
n't
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
were
,
too
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
You
should
n't
have
ever
told
me
such
*NL*
a
story
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
did
n't
have
much
to
do
with
him
,
did
you
?
''
went
on
Drouet
,
*NL*
anxious
for
his
own
peace
of
mind
to
get
some
direct
denial
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
talk
about
it
,
''
said
Carrie
,
pained
at
the
quizzical
turn
the
*NL*
peace
arrangement
had
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
of
acting
like
that
now
,
Cad
?
''
insisted
the
drummer
,
*NL*
stopping
in
his
work
and
putting
up
a
hand
expressively
.
``
You
might
let
*NL*
me
know
where
I
stand
,
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
,
feeling
no
refuge
but
in
anger
.
``
Whatever
has
*NL*
happened
is
your
own
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
do
care
for
him
?
''
said
Drouet
,
stopping
completely
and
*NL*
experiencing
a
rush
of
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
stop
!
''
said
Carrie
.
``
Well
,
I
'll
not
be
made
a
fool
of
,
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Drouet
.
``
You
may
trifle
around
with
him
if
you
want
to
,
but
you
ca
n't
*NL*
lead
me
.
You
can
tell
me
or
not
,
just
as
you
want
to
,
but
I
wo
n't
fool
*NL*
any
longer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shoved
the
last
few
remaining
things
he
had
laid
out
into
his
valise
*NL*
and
snapped
it
with
a
vengeance
.
Then
he
grabbed
his
coat
,
which
he
had
*NL*
laid
off
to
work
,
picked
up
his
gloves
,
and
started
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
go
to
the
deuce
as
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
*NL*
reached
the
door
.
``
I
'm
no
sucker
,
''
and
with
that
he
opened
it
with
a
*NL*
jerk
and
closed
it
equally
vigorously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
listened
at
her
window
view
,
more
astonished
than
anything
else
*NL*
at
this
sudden
rise
of
passion
in
the
drummer
.
She
could
hardly
believe
*NL*
her
senses
--
so
good-natured
and
tractable
had
he
invariably
been
.
It
was
*NL*
not
for
her
to
see
the
wellspring
of
human
passion
.
A
real
flame
of
love
*NL*
is
a
subtle
thing
.
It
burns
as
a
will-o
'
-
the-wisp
,
dancing
onward
to
*NL*
fairylands
of
delight
.
It
roars
as
a
furnace
.
Too
often
jealousy
is
the
*NL*
quality
upon
which
it
feeds
.

ASHES
OF
TINDER
--
A
FACE
AT
THE
WINDOW
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
Hurstwood
remained
down
town
entirely
,
going
to
the
Palmer
*NL*
House
for
a
bed
after
his
work
was
through
.
He
was
in
a
fevered
state
of
*NL*
mind
,
owing
to
the
blight
his
wife
's
action
threatened
to
cast
upon
*NL*
his
entire
future
.
While
he
was
not
sure
how
much
significance
might
be
*NL*
attached
to
the
threat
she
had
made
,
he
was
sure
that
her
attitude
,
if
*NL*
long
continued
,
would
cause
him
no
end
of
trouble
.
She
was
determined
,
*NL*
and
had
worsted
him
in
a
very
important
contest
.
How
would
it
be
from
*NL*
now
on
?
He
walked
the
floor
of
his
little
office
,
and
later
that
of
his
*NL*
room
,
putting
one
thing
and
another
together
to
no
avail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurstwood
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
decided
not
to
lose
her
advantage
*NL*
by
inaction
.
Now
that
she
had
practically
cowed
him
,
she
would
follow
up
*NL*
her
work
with
demands
,
the
acknowledgment
of
which
would
make
her
word
*NL*
LAW
in
the
future
.
He
would
have
to
pay
her
the
money
which
she
would
*NL*
now
regularly
demand
or
there
would
be
trouble
.
It
did
not
matter
what
*NL*
he
did
.
She
really
did
not
care
whether
he
came
home
any
more
or
not
.
*NL*
The
household
would
move
along
much
more
pleasantly
without
him
,
and
she
*NL*
could
do
as
she
wished
without
consulting
any
one
.
Now
she
proposed
to
*NL*
consult
a
lawyer
and
hire
a
detective
.
She
would
find
out
at
once
just
*NL*
what
advantages
she
could
gain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
walked
the
floor
,
mentally
arranging
the
chief
points
of
*NL*
his
situation
.
``
She
has
that
property
in
her
name
,
''
he
kept
saying
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
What
a
fool
trick
that
was
.
Curse
it
!
What
a
fool
move
that
*NL*
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
also
thought
of
his
managerial
position
.
``
If
she
raises
a
row
now
*NL*
I
'll
lose
this
thing
.
They
wo
n't
have
me
around
if
my
name
gets
in
the
*NL*
papers
.
My
friends
,
too
!
''
He
grew
more
angry
as
he
thought
of
the
talk
*NL*
any
action
on
her
part
would
create
.
How
would
the
papers
talk
about
it
?
*NL*
Every
man
he
knew
would
be
wondering
.
He
would
have
to
explain
and
deny
*NL*
and
make
a
general
mark
of
himself
.
Then
Moy
would
come
and
confer
with
*NL*
him
and
there
would
be
the
devil
to
pay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
little
wrinkles
gathered
between
his
eyes
as
he
contemplated
this
,
*NL*
and
his
brow
moistened
.
He
saw
no
solution
of
anything
--
not
a
loophole
*NL*
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
all
this
thoughts
of
Carrie
flashed
upon
him
,
and
the
*NL*
approaching
affair
of
Saturday
.
Tangled
as
all
his
matters
were
,
he
did
*NL*
not
worry
over
that
.
It
was
the
one
pleasing
thing
in
this
whole
rout
of
*NL*
trouble
.
He
could
arrange
that
satisfactorily
,
for
Carrie
would
be
glad
*NL*
to
wait
,
if
necessary
.
He
would
see
how
things
turned
out
to-morrow
,
and
*NL*
then
he
would
talk
to
her
.
They
were
going
to
meet
as
usual
.
He
saw
only
*NL*
her
pretty
face
and
neat
figure
and
wondered
why
life
was
not
arranged
*NL*
so
that
such
joy
as
he
found
with
her
could
be
steadily
maintained
.
How
*NL*
much
more
pleasant
it
would
be
.
Then
he
would
take
up
his
wife
's
threat
*NL*
again
,
and
the
wrinkles
and
moisture
would
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
he
came
over
from
the
hotel
and
opened
his
mail
,
but
*NL*
there
was
nothing
in
it
outside
the
ordinary
run
.
For
some
reason
he
*NL*
felt
as
if
something
might
come
that
way
,
and
was
relieved
when
all
the
*NL*
envelopes
had
been
scanned
and
nothing
suspicious
noticed
.
He
began
*NL*
to
feel
the
appetite
that
had
been
wanting
before
he
had
reached
the
*NL*
office
,
and
decided
before
going
out
to
the
park
to
meet
Carrie
to
drop
*NL*
in
at
the
Grand
Pacific
and
have
a
pot
of
coffee
and
some
rolls
.
While
*NL*
the
danger
had
not
lessened
,
it
had
not
as
yet
materialised
,
and
with
*NL*
him
no
news
was
good
news
.
If
he
could
only
get
plenty
of
time
to
think
,
*NL*
perhaps
something
would
turn
up
.
Surely
,
surely
,
this
thing
would
not
*NL*
drift
along
to
catastrophe
and
he
not
find
a
way
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
spirits
fell
,
however
,
when
,
upon
reaching
the
park
,
he
waited
and
*NL*
waited
and
Carrie
did
not
come
.
He
held
his
favourite
post
for
an
hour
*NL*
or
more
,
then
arose
and
began
to
walk
about
restlessly
.
Could
something
*NL*
have
happened
out
there
to
keep
her
away
?
Could
she
have
been
reached
*NL*
by
his
wife
?
Surely
not
.
So
little
did
he
consider
Drouet
that
it
never
*NL*
once
occurred
to
him
to
worry
about
his
finding
out
.
He
grew
restless
as
*NL*
he
ruminated
,
and
then
decided
that
perhaps
it
was
nothing
.
She
had
not
*NL*
been
able
to
get
away
this
morning
.
That
was
why
no
letter
notifying
him
*NL*
had
come
.
He
would
get
one
to-day
.
It
would
probably
be
on
his
desk
when
*NL*
he
got
back
.
He
would
look
for
it
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
he
gave
up
waiting
and
drearily
headed
for
the
Madison
car
.
*NL*
To
add
to
his
distress
,
the
bright
blue
sky
became
overcast
with
little
*NL*
fleecy
clouds
which
shut
out
the
sun
.
The
wind
veered
to
the
east
,
and
*NL*
by
the
time
he
reached
his
office
it
was
threatening
to
drizzle
all
*NL*
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
in
and
examined
his
letters
,
but
there
was
nothing
from
Carrie
.
*NL*
Fortunately
,
there
was
nothing
from
his
wife
either
.
He
thanked
his
*NL*
stars
that
he
did
not
have
to
confront
that
proposition
just
now
when
he
*NL*
needed
to
think
so
much
.
He
walked
the
floor
again
,
pretending
to
be
in
*NL*
an
ordinary
mood
,
but
secretly
troubled
beyond
the
expression
of
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one-thirty
he
went
to
Rector
's
for
lunch
,
and
when
he
returned
a
*NL*
messenger
was
waiting
for
him
.
He
looked
at
the
little
chap
with
a
*NL*
feeling
of
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
to
bring
an
answer
,
''
said
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
recognised
his
wife
's
writing
.
He
tore
it
open
and
read
*NL*
without
a
show
of
feeling
.
It
began
in
the
most
formal
manner
and
was
*NL*
sharply
and
coldly
worded
throughout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
send
the
money
I
asked
for
at
once
.
I
need
it
to
carry
*NL*
out
my
plans
.
You
can
stay
away
if
you
want
to
.
It
does
n't
matter
in
the
*NL*
least
.
But
I
must
have
some
money
.
So
do
n't
delay
,
but
send
it
by
the
*NL*
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
it
,
he
stood
holding
it
in
his
hands
.
The
audacity
*NL*
of
the
thing
took
his
breath
.
It
roused
his
ire
also
--
the
deepest
*NL*
element
of
revolt
in
him
.
His
first
impulse
was
to
write
but
four
words
*NL*
in
reply
--
``
Go
to
the
devil
!
''
--
but
he
compromised
by
telling
the
boy
that
*NL*
there
would
be
no
reply
.
Then
he
sat
down
in
his
chair
and
gazed
without
*NL*
seeing
,
contemplating
the
result
of
his
work
.
What
would
she
do
about
*NL*
that
?
The
confounded
wretch
!
Was
she
going
to
try
to
bulldoze
him
into
*NL*
submission
?
He
would
go
up
there
and
have
it
out
with
her
,
that
's
what
*NL*
he
would
do
.
She
was
carrying
things
with
too
high
a
hand
.
These
were
*NL*
his
first
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
,
however
,
his
old
discretion
asserted
itself
.
Something
had
to
*NL*
be
done
.
A
climax
was
near
and
she
would
not
sit
idle
.
He
knew
her
well
*NL*
enough
to
know
that
when
she
had
decided
upon
a
plan
she
would
follow
it
*NL*
up
.
Possibly
matters
would
go
into
a
lawyer
's
hands
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
her
!
''
he
said
softly
,
with
his
teeth
firmly
set
,
``
I
'll
make
it
*NL*
hot
for
her
if
she
causes
me
trouble
.
I
'll
make
her
change
her
tone
if
I
*NL*
have
to
use
force
to
do
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
arose
from
his
chair
and
went
and
looked
out
into
the
street
.
The
*NL*
long
drizzle
had
begun
.
Pedestrians
had
turned
up
collars
,
and
trousers
*NL*
at
the
bottom
.
Hands
were
hidden
in
the
pockets
of
the
umbrellaless
;
*NL*
umbrellas
were
up
.
The
street
looked
like
a
sea
of
round
black
cloth
*NL*
roofs
,
twisting
,
bobbing
,
moving
.
Trucks
and
vans
were
rattling
in
a
*NL*
noisy
line
and
everywhere
men
were
shielding
themselves
as
best
they
*NL*
could
.
He
scarcely
noticed
the
picture
.
He
was
forever
confronting
*NL*
his
wife
,
demanding
of
her
to
change
her
attitude
toward
him
before
he
*NL*
worked
her
bodily
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
four
o'clock
another
note
came
,
which
simply
said
that
if
the
*NL*
money
was
not
forthcoming
that
evening
the
matter
would
be
laid
before
*NL*
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
on
the
morrow
,
and
other
steps
would
be
taken
to
get
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
almost
exclaimed
out
loud
at
the
insistency
of
this
thing
.
*NL*
Yes
,
he
would
send
her
the
money
.
He
'd
take
it
to
her
--
he
would
go
up
*NL*
there
and
have
a
talk
with
her
,
and
that
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
on
his
hat
and
looked
around
for
his
umbrella
.
He
would
have
some
*NL*
arrangement
of
this
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
a
cab
and
was
driven
through
the
dreary
rain
to
the
North
*NL*
Side
.
On
the
way
his
temper
cooled
as
he
thought
of
the
details
of
the
*NL*
case
.
What
did
she
know
?
What
had
she
done
?
Maybe
she
'd
got
hold
of
*NL*
Carrie
,
who
knows
--
or
--
or
Drouet
.
Perhaps
she
really
had
evidence
,
and
*NL*
was
prepared
to
fell
him
as
a
man
does
another
from
secret
ambush
.
*NL*
She
was
shrewd
.
Why
should
she
taunt
him
this
way
unless
she
had
good
*NL*
grounds
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
wish
that
he
had
compromised
in
some
way
or
other
--
that
he
*NL*
had
sent
the
money
.
Perhaps
he
could
do
it
up
here
.
He
would
go
in
and
*NL*
see
,
anyhow
.
He
would
have
no
row
.
By
the
time
he
reached
his
own
street
*NL*
he
was
keenly
alive
to
the
difficulties
of
his
situation
and
wished
over
*NL*
and
over
that
some
solution
would
offer
itself
,
that
he
could
see
his
*NL*
way
out
.
He
alighted
and
went
up
the
steps
to
the
front
door
,
but
it
was
*NL*
with
a
nervous
palpitation
of
the
heart
.
He
pulled
out
his
key
and
tried
*NL*
to
insert
it
,
but
another
key
was
on
the
inside
.
He
shook
at
the
knob
,
*NL*
but
the
door
was
locked
.
Then
he
rang
the
bell
.
No
answer
.
He
rang
*NL*
again
--
this
time
harder
.
Still
no
answer
.
He
jangled
it
fiercely
several
*NL*
times
in
succession
,
but
without
avail
.
Then
he
went
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
door
which
opened
under
the
steps
into
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
protected
by
an
iron
grating
,
intended
as
a
safeguard
against
burglars
.
*NL*
When
he
reached
this
he
noticed
that
it
also
was
bolted
and
that
the
*NL*
kitchen
windows
were
down
.
What
could
it
mean
?
He
rang
the
bell
and
then
*NL*
waited
.
Finally
,
seeing
that
no
one
was
coming
,
he
turned
and
went
back
*NL*
to
his
cab
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
they
've
gone
out
,
''
he
said
apologetically
to
the
individual
who
*NL*
was
hiding
his
red
face
in
a
loose
tarpaulin
raincoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
a
young
girl
up
in
that
winder
,
''
returned
the
cabby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
looked
,
but
there
was
no
face
there
now
.
He
climbed
moodily
*NL*
into
the
cab
,
relieved
and
distressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
this
was
the
game
,
was
it
?
Shut
him
out
and
make
him
pay
.
Well
,
by
*NL*
the
Lord
,
that
did
beat
all
!

ASHES
OF
TINDER
--
THE
LOOSING
OF
STAYS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Hurstwood
got
back
to
his
office
again
he
was
in
a
greater
quandary
*NL*
than
ever
.
Lord
,
Lord
,
he
thought
,
what
had
he
got
into
?
How
could
*NL*
things
have
taken
such
a
violent
turn
,
and
so
quickly
?
He
could
hardly
*NL*
realise
how
it
had
all
come
about
.
It
seemed
a
monstrous
,
unnatural
,
*NL*
unwarranted
condition
which
had
suddenly
descended
upon
him
without
his
*NL*
let
or
hindrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
he
gave
a
thought
now
and
then
to
Carrie
.
What
could
be
the
*NL*
trouble
in
that
quarter
?
No
letter
had
come
,
no
word
of
any
kind
,
and
*NL*
yet
here
it
was
late
in
the
evening
and
she
had
agreed
to
meet
him
that
*NL*
morning
.
To-morrow
they
were
to
have
met
and
gone
off
--
where
?
He
saw
*NL*
that
in
the
excitement
of
recent
events
he
had
not
formulated
a
plan
*NL*
upon
that
score
.
He
was
desperately
in
love
,
and
would
have
taken
great
*NL*
chances
to
win
her
under
ordinary
circumstances
,
but
now
--
now
what
?
*NL*
Supposing
she
had
found
out
something
?
Supposing
she
,
too
,
wrote
him
and
*NL*
told
him
that
she
knew
all
--
that
she
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
*NL*
him
?
It
would
be
just
like
this
to
happen
as
things
were
going
now
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
he
had
not
sent
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
strolled
up
and
down
the
polished
floor
of
the
resort
,
his
hands
in
*NL*
his
pockets
,
his
brow
wrinkled
,
his
mouth
set
.
He
was
getting
some
vague
*NL*
comfort
out
of
a
good
cigar
,
but
it
was
no
panacea
for
the
ill
which
*NL*
affected
him
.
Every
once
in
a
while
he
would
clinch
his
fingers
and
tap
*NL*
his
foot
--
signs
of
the
stirring
mental
process
he
was
undergoing
.
His
*NL*
whole
nature
was
vigorously
and
powerfully
shaken
up
,
and
he
was
finding
*NL*
what
limits
the
mind
has
to
endurance
.
He
drank
more
brandy
and
soda
*NL*
than
he
had
any
evening
in
months
.
He
was
altogether
a
fine
example
of
*NL*
great
mental
perturbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
his
study
nothing
came
of
the
evening
except
this
--
he
sent
the
*NL*
money
.
It
was
with
great
opposition
,
after
two
or
three
hours
of
the
*NL*
most
urgent
mental
affirmation
and
denial
,
that
at
last
he
got
an
*NL*
envelope
,
placed
in
it
the
requested
amount
,
and
slowly
sealed
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
called
Harry
,
the
boy
of
all
work
around
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
take
this
to
this
address
,
''
he
said
,
handing
him
the
envelope
,
``
and
*NL*
give
it
to
Mrs.
Hurstwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
is
n't
there
bring
it
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
seen
my
wife
?
''
he
asked
as
a
precautionary
measure
as
the
boy
*NL*
turned
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
sir
.
I
know
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
now
.
Hurry
right
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
answer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
hastened
away
and
the
manager
fell
to
his
musings
.
Now
he
had
*NL*
done
it
.
There
was
no
use
speculating
over
that
.
He
was
beaten
for
*NL*
to-night
and
he
might
just
as
well
make
the
best
of
it
.
But
,
oh
,
the
*NL*
wretchedness
of
being
forced
this
way
!
He
could
see
her
meeting
the
boy
*NL*
at
the
door
and
smiling
sardonically
.
She
would
take
the
envelope
and
*NL*
know
that
she
had
triumphed
.
If
he
only
had
that
letter
back
he
would
n't
*NL*
send
it
.
He
breathed
heavily
and
wiped
the
moisture
from
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
relief
,
he
arose
and
joined
in
conversation
with
a
few
friends
who
*NL*
were
drinking
.
He
tried
to
get
the
interest
of
things
about
him
,
but
it
*NL*
was
not
to
be
.
All
the
time
his
thoughts
would
run
out
to
his
home
and
*NL*
see
the
scene
being
therein
enacted
.
All
the
time
he
was
wondering
what
*NL*
she
would
say
when
the
boy
handed
her
the
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
an
hour
and
three-quarters
the
boy
returned
.
He
had
evidently
*NL*
delivered
the
package
,
for
,
as
he
came
up
,
he
made
no
sign
of
taking
*NL*
anything
out
of
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
it
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
answer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
it
was
high
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
scowled
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
more
to
be
done
upon
that
score
that
night
.
He
went
on
*NL*
brooding
over
his
situation
until
midnight
,
when
he
repaired
again
to
*NL*
the
Palmer
House
.
He
wondered
what
the
morning
would
bring
forth
,
and
*NL*
slept
anything
but
soundly
upon
it
.
Next
day
he
went
again
to
the
office
*NL*
and
opened
his
mail
,
suspicious
and
hopeful
of
its
contents
.
No
word
*NL*
from
Carrie
.
Nothing
from
his
wife
,
which
was
pleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
that
he
had
sent
the
money
and
that
she
had
received
it
*NL*
worked
to
the
ease
of
his
mind
,
for
,
as
the
thought
that
he
had
done
*NL*
it
receded
,
his
chagrin
at
it
grew
less
and
his
hope
of
peace
more
.
He
*NL*
fancied
,
as
he
sat
at
his
desk
,
that
nothing
would
be
done
for
a
week
or
*NL*
two
.
Meanwhile
,
he
would
have
time
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
process
of
THINKING
began
by
a
reversion
to
Carrie
and
the
*NL*
arrangement
by
which
he
was
to
get
her
away
from
Drouet
.
How
about
that
*NL*
now
?
His
pain
at
her
failure
to
meet
or
write
him
rapidly
increased
as
*NL*
he
devoted
himself
to
this
subject
.
He
decided
to
write
her
care
of
the
*NL*
West
Side
Post-office
and
ask
for
an
explanation
,
as
well
as
to
have
*NL*
her
meet
him
.
The
thought
that
this
letter
would
probably
not
reach
*NL*
her
until
Monday
chafed
him
exceedingly
.
He
must
get
some
speedier
*NL*
method
--
but
how
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
upon
it
for
a
half-hour
,
not
contemplating
a
messenger
or
a
*NL*
cab
direct
to
the
house
,
owing
to
the
exposure
of
it
,
but
finding
that
*NL*
time
was
slipping
away
to
no
purpose
,
he
wrote
the
letter
and
then
began
*NL*
to
think
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hours
slipped
by
,
and
with
them
the
possibility
of
the
union
he
had
*NL*
contemplated
.
He
had
thought
to
be
joyously
aiding
Carrie
by
now
in
*NL*
the
task
of
joining
her
interests
to
his
,
and
here
it
was
afternoon
and
*NL*
nothing
done
.
Three
o'clock
came
,
four
,
five
,
six
,
and
no
letter
.
The
*NL*
helpless
manager
paced
the
floor
and
grimly
endured
the
gloom
of
defeat
.
*NL*
He
saw
a
busy
Saturday
ushered
out
,
the
Sabbath
in
,
and
nothing
done
.
*NL*
All
day
,
the
bar
being
closed
,
he
brooded
alone
,
shut
out
from
home
,
*NL*
from
the
excitement
of
his
resort
,
from
Carrie
,
and
without
the
ability
*NL*
to
alter
his
condition
one
iota
.
It
was
the
worst
Sunday
he
had
spent
in
*NL*
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Monday
's
second
mail
he
encountered
a
very
legal-looking
letter
,
*NL*
which
held
his
interest
for
some
time
.
It
bore
the
imprint
of
the
law
*NL*
offices
of
McGregor
,
James
and
Hay
,
and
with
a
very
formal
``
Dear
Sir
,
''
*NL*
and
``
We
beg
to
state
,
''
went
on
to
inform
him
briefly
that
they
had
been
*NL*
retained
by
Mrs.
Julia
Hurstwood
to
adjust
certain
matters
which
related
*NL*
to
her
sustenance
and
property
rights
,
and
would
he
kindly
call
and
see
*NL*
them
about
the
matter
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
it
through
carefully
several
times
,
and
then
merely
shook
his
*NL*
head
.
It
seemed
as
if
his
family
troubles
were
just
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
he
said
after
a
time
,
quite
audibly
,
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
add
to
his
misery
there
was
no
word
from
Carrie
.
He
was
quite
certain
*NL*
now
that
she
knew
he
was
married
and
was
angered
at
his
perfidy
.
His
*NL*
loss
seemed
all
the
more
bitter
now
that
he
needed
her
most
.
He
thought
*NL*
he
would
go
out
and
insist
on
seeing
her
if
she
did
not
send
him
word
*NL*
of
some
sort
soon
.
He
was
really
affected
most
miserably
of
all
by
*NL*
this
desertion
.
He
had
loved
her
earnestly
enough
,
but
now
that
the
*NL*
possibility
of
losing
her
stared
him
in
the
face
she
seemed
much
more
*NL*
attractive
.
He
really
pined
for
a
word
,
and
looked
out
upon
her
with
his
*NL*
mind
's
eye
in
the
most
wistful
manner
.
He
did
not
propose
to
lose
her
,
*NL*
whatever
she
might
think
.
Come
what
might
,
he
would
adjust
this
matter
,
*NL*
and
soon
.
He
would
go
to
her
and
tell
her
all
his
family
complications
.
*NL*
He
would
explain
to
her
just
where
he
stood
and
how
much
he
needed
her
.
*NL*
Surely
she
could
n't
go
back
on
him
now
?
It
was
n't
possible
.
He
would
*NL*
plead
until
her
anger
would
melt
--
until
she
would
forgive
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
thought
:
``
Supposing
she
is
n't
out
there
--
suppose
she
has
*NL*
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
forced
to
take
his
feet
.
It
was
too
much
to
think
of
and
sit
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
his
rousing
availed
him
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Tuesday
it
was
the
same
way
.
He
did
manage
to
bring
himself
into
the
*NL*
mood
to
go
out
to
Carrie
,
but
when
he
got
in
Ogden
Place
he
thought
he
*NL*
saw
a
man
watching
him
and
went
away
.
He
did
not
go
within
a
block
of
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
galling
incidents
of
this
visit
was
that
he
came
back
on
a
*NL*
Randolph
Street
car
,
and
without
noticing
arrived
almost
opposite
the
*NL*
building
of
the
concern
with
which
his
son
was
connected
.
This
sent
a
*NL*
pang
through
his
heart
.
He
had
called
on
his
boy
there
several
times
.
*NL*
Now
the
lad
had
not
sent
him
a
word
.
His
absence
did
not
seem
to
be
*NL*
noticed
by
either
of
his
children
.
Well
,
well
,
fortune
plays
a
man
queer
*NL*
tricks
.
He
got
back
to
his
office
and
joined
in
a
conversation
with
*NL*
friends
.
It
was
as
if
idle
chatter
deadened
the
sense
of
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
he
dined
at
Rector
's
and
returned
at
once
to
his
office
.
In
*NL*
the
bustle
and
show
of
the
latter
was
his
only
relief
.
He
troubled
over
*NL*
many
little
details
and
talked
perfunctorily
to
everybody
.
He
stayed
at
*NL*
his
desk
long
after
all
others
had
gone
,
and
only
quitted
it
when
the
*NL*
night
watchman
on
his
round
pulled
at
the
front
door
to
see
if
it
was
*NL*
safely
locked
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Wednesday
he
received
another
polite
note
from
McGregor
,
James
and
*NL*
Hay
.
It
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Sir
:
We
beg
to
inform
you
that
we
are
instructed
to
wait
until
*NL*
to-morrow
-LRB-
Thursday
-RRB-
at
one
o'clock
,
before
filing
suit
against
you
,
on
*NL*
behalf
of
Mrs.
Julia
Hurstwood
,
for
divorce
and
alimony
.
If
we
do
not
*NL*
hear
from
you
before
that
time
we
shall
consider
that
you
do
not
wish
to
*NL*
compromise
the
matter
in
any
way
and
act
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
truly
yours
,
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Compromise
!
''
exclaimed
Hurstwood
bitterly
.
``
Compromise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
here
it
was
spread
out
clear
before
him
,
and
now
he
knew
what
to
*NL*
expect
.
If
he
did
n't
go
and
see
them
they
would
sue
him
promptly
.
If
he
*NL*
did
,
he
would
be
offered
terms
that
would
make
his
blood
boil
.
He
folded
*NL*
the
letter
and
put
it
with
the
other
one
.
Then
he
put
on
his
hat
and
*NL*
went
for
a
turn
about
the
block
.

Chapter
XXVI
.
THE
AMBASSADOR
FALLEN
--
A
SEARCH
FOR
THE
GATE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
,
left
alone
by
Drouet
,
listened
to
his
retreating
steps
,
scarcely
*NL*
realising
what
had
happened
.
She
knew
that
he
had
stormed
out
.
It
was
*NL*
some
moments
before
she
questioned
whether
he
would
return
,
not
now
*NL*
exactly
,
but
ever
.
She
looked
around
her
upon
the
rooms
,
out
of
which
*NL*
the
evening
light
was
dying
,
and
wondered
why
she
did
not
feel
quite
*NL*
the
same
towards
them
.
She
went
over
to
the
dresser
and
struck
a
match
,
*NL*
lighting
the
gas
.
Then
she
went
back
to
the
rocker
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
time
before
she
could
collect
her
thoughts
,
but
when
she
*NL*
did
,
this
truth
began
to
take
on
importance
.
She
was
quite
alone
.
*NL*
Suppose
Drouet
did
not
come
back
?
Suppose
she
should
never
hear
anything
*NL*
more
of
him
?
This
fine
arrangement
of
chambers
would
not
last
long
.
She
*NL*
would
have
to
quit
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
credit
,
be
it
said
,
she
never
once
counted
on
Hurstwood
.
She
*NL*
could
only
approach
that
subject
with
a
pang
of
sorrow
and
regret
.
For
*NL*
a
truth
,
she
was
rather
shocked
and
frightened
by
this
evidence
of
human
*NL*
depravity
.
He
would
have
tricked
her
without
turning
an
eyelash
.
She
*NL*
would
have
been
led
into
a
newer
and
worse
situation
.
And
yet
she
could
*NL*
not
keep
out
the
pictures
of
his
looks
and
manners
.
Only
this
one
deed
*NL*
seemed
strange
and
miserable
.
It
contrasted
sharply
with
all
she
felt
*NL*
and
knew
concerning
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
alone
.
That
was
the
greater
thought
just
at
present
.
How
*NL*
about
that
?
Would
she
go
out
to
work
again
?
Would
she
begin
to
look
*NL*
around
in
the
business
district
?
The
stage
!
Oh
,
yes
.
Drouet
had
spoken
*NL*
about
that
.
Was
there
any
hope
there
?
She
moved
to
and
fro
,
in
deep
*NL*
and
varied
thoughts
,
while
the
minutes
slipped
away
and
night
fell
*NL*
completely
.
She
had
had
nothing
to
eat
,
and
yet
there
she
sat
,
thinking
*NL*
it
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remembered
that
she
was
hungry
and
went
to
the
little
cupboard
in
*NL*
the
rear
room
where
were
the
remains
of
one
of
their
breakfasts
.
She
*NL*
looked
at
these
things
with
certain
misgivings
.
The
contemplation
of
*NL*
food
had
more
significance
than
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
eating
she
began
to
wonder
how
much
money
she
had
.
It
*NL*
struck
her
as
exceedingly
important
,
and
without
ado
she
went
to
look
*NL*
for
her
purse
.
It
was
on
the
dresser
,
and
in
it
were
seven
dollars
in
*NL*
bills
and
some
change
.
She
quailed
as
she
thought
of
the
insignificance
*NL*
of
the
amount
and
rejoiced
because
the
rent
was
paid
until
the
end
of
*NL*
the
month
.
She
began
also
to
think
what
she
would
have
done
if
she
had
*NL*
gone
out
into
the
street
when
she
first
started
.
By
the
side
of
that
*NL*
situation
,
as
she
looked
at
it
now
,
the
present
seemed
agreeable
.
She
*NL*
had
a
little
time
at
least
,
and
then
,
perhaps
,
everything
would
come
out
*NL*
all
right
,
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
had
gone
,
but
what
of
it
?
He
did
not
seem
seriously
angry
.
He
*NL*
only
acted
as
if
he
were
huffy
.
He
would
come
back
--
of
course
he
would
.
*NL*
There
was
his
cane
in
the
corner
.
Here
was
one
of
his
collars
.
He
had
*NL*
left
his
light
overcoat
in
the
wardrobe
.
She
looked
about
and
tried
to
*NL*
assure
herself
with
the
sight
of
a
dozen
such
details
,
but
,
alas
,
the
*NL*
secondary
thought
arrived
.
Supposing
he
did
come
back
.
Then
what
?
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
another
proposition
nearly
,
if
not
quite
,
as
disturbing
.
She
*NL*
would
have
to
talk
with
and
explain
to
him
.
He
would
want
her
to
admit
*NL*
that
he
was
right
.
It
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
live
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Friday
Carrie
remembered
her
appointment
with
Hurstwood
,
and
the
*NL*
passing
of
the
hour
when
she
should
,
by
all
right
of
promise
,
have
*NL*
been
in
his
company
served
to
keep
the
calamity
which
had
befallen
her
*NL*
exceedingly
fresh
and
clear
.
In
her
nervousness
and
stress
of
mind
she
*NL*
felt
it
necessary
to
act
,
and
consequently
put
on
a
brown
street
dress
,
*NL*
and
at
eleven
o'clock
started
to
visit
the
business
portion
once
again
.
*NL*
She
must
look
for
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
,
which
threatened
at
twelve
and
began
at
one
,
served
equally
*NL*
well
to
cause
her
to
retrace
her
steps
and
remain
within
doors
as
it
did
*NL*
to
reduce
Hurstwood
's
spirits
and
give
him
a
wretched
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morrow
was
Saturday
,
a
half-holiday
in
many
business
quarters
,
and
*NL*
besides
it
was
a
balmy
,
radiant
day
,
with
the
trees
and
grass
shining
*NL*
exceedingly
green
after
the
rain
of
the
night
before
.
When
she
went
out
*NL*
the
sparrows
were
twittering
merrily
in
joyous
choruses
.
She
could
not
*NL*
help
feeling
,
as
she
looked
across
the
lovely
park
,
that
life
was
a
*NL*
joyous
thing
for
those
who
did
not
need
to
worry
,
and
she
wished
over
*NL*
and
over
that
something
might
interfere
now
to
preserve
for
her
the
*NL*
comfortable
state
which
she
had
occupied
.
She
did
not
want
Drouet
or
his
*NL*
money
when
she
thought
of
it
,
nor
anything
more
to
do
with
Hurstwood
,
*NL*
but
only
the
content
and
ease
of
mind
she
had
experienced
,
for
,
after
*NL*
all
,
she
had
been
happy
--
happier
,
at
least
,
than
she
was
now
when
*NL*
confronted
by
the
necessity
of
making
her
way
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
arrived
in
the
business
part
it
was
quite
eleven
o'clock
,
*NL*
and
the
business
had
little
longer
to
run
.
She
did
not
realise
this
at
*NL*
first
,
being
affected
by
some
of
the
old
distress
which
was
a
result
*NL*
of
her
earlier
adventure
into
this
strenuous
and
exacting
quarter
.
She
*NL*
wandered
about
,
assuring
herself
that
she
was
making
up
her
mind
to
*NL*
look
for
something
,
and
at
the
same
time
feeling
that
perhaps
it
was
*NL*
not
necessary
to
be
in
such
haste
about
it
.
The
thing
was
difficult
to
*NL*
encounter
,
and
she
had
a
few
days
.
Besides
,
she
was
not
sure
that
*NL*
she
was
really
face
to
face
again
with
the
bitter
problem
of
*NL*
self-sustenance
.
Anyhow
,
there
was
one
change
for
the
better
.
She
knew
*NL*
that
she
had
improved
in
appearance
.
Her
manner
had
vastly
changed
.
Her
*NL*
clothes
were
becoming
,
and
men
--
well-dressed
men
,
some
of
the
kind
*NL*
who
before
had
gazed
at
her
indifferently
from
behind
their
polished
*NL*
railings
and
imposing
office
partitions
--
now
gazed
into
her
face
with
a
*NL*
soft
light
in
their
eyes
.
In
a
way
,
she
felt
the
power
and
satisfaction
*NL*
of
the
thing
,
but
it
did
not
wholly
reassure
her
.
She
looked
for
nothing
*NL*
save
what
might
come
legitimately
and
without
the
appearance
of
special
*NL*
favour
.
She
wanted
something
,
but
no
man
should
buy
her
by
false
*NL*
protestations
or
favour
.
She
proposed
to
earn
her
living
honestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
store
closes
at
one
on
Saturdays
,
''
was
a
pleasing
and
satisfactory
*NL*
legend
to
see
upon
doors
which
she
felt
she
ought
to
enter
and
inquire
*NL*
for
work
.
It
gave
her
an
excuse
,
and
after
encountering
quite
a
number
*NL*
of
them
,
and
noting
that
the
clock
registered
12.15
,
she
decided
that
it
*NL*
would
be
no
use
to
seek
further
to-day
,
so
she
got
on
a
car
and
went
to
*NL*
Lincoln
Park
.
There
was
always
something
to
see
there
--
the
flowers
,
the
*NL*
animals
,
the
lake
--
and
she
flattered
herself
that
on
Monday
she
would
be
*NL*
up
betimes
and
searching
.
Besides
,
many
things
might
happen
between
now
*NL*
and
Monday
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sunday
passed
with
equal
doubts
,
worries
,
assurances
,
and
heaven
knows
*NL*
what
vagaries
of
mind
and
spirit
.
Every
half-hour
in
the
day
the
thought
*NL*
would
come
to
her
most
sharply
,
like
the
tail
of
a
swishing
whip
,
that
*NL*
action
--
immediate
action
--
was
imperative
.
At
other
times
she
would
look
*NL*
about
her
and
assure
herself
that
things
were
not
so
bad
--
that
certainly
*NL*
she
would
come
out
safe
and
sound
.
At
such
times
she
would
think
of
*NL*
Drouet
's
advice
about
going
on
the
stage
,
and
saw
some
chance
for
*NL*
herself
in
that
quarter
.
She
decided
to
take
up
that
opportunity
on
the
*NL*
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
she
arose
early
Monday
morning
and
dressed
herself
*NL*
carefully
.
She
did
not
know
just
how
such
applications
were
made
,
but
*NL*
she
took
it
to
be
a
matter
which
related
more
directly
to
the
theatre
*NL*
buildings
.
All
you
had
to
do
was
to
inquire
of
some
one
about
the
*NL*
theatre
for
the
manager
and
ask
for
a
position
.
If
there
was
anything
,
*NL*
you
might
get
it
,
or
,
at
least
,
he
could
tell
you
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
had
no
experience
with
this
class
of
individuals
whatsoever
,
and
*NL*
did
not
know
the
salacity
and
humour
of
the
theatrical
tribe
.
She
only
*NL*
knew
of
the
position
which
Mr.
Hale
occupied
,
but
,
of
all
things
,
she
*NL*
did
not
wish
to
encounter
that
personage
,
on
account
of
her
intimacy
*NL*
with
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
however
,
at
this
time
,
one
theatre
,
the
Chicago
Opera
House
,
*NL*
which
was
considerably
in
the
public
eye
,
and
its
manager
,
David
A.
*NL*
Henderson
,
had
a
fair
local
reputation
.
Carrie
had
seen
one
or
two
*NL*
elaborate
performances
there
and
had
heard
of
several
others
.
She
*NL*
knew
nothing
of
Henderson
nor
of
the
methods
of
applying
,
but
she
*NL*
instinctively
felt
that
this
would
be
a
likely
place
,
and
accordingly
*NL*
strolled
about
in
that
neighbourhood
.
She
came
bravely
enough
to
the
*NL*
showy
entrance
way
,
with
the
polished
and
begilded
lobby
,
set
with
*NL*
framed
pictures
out
of
the
current
attraction
,
leading
up
to
the
quiet
*NL*
box-office
,
but
she
could
get
no
further
.
A
noted
comic
opera
comedian
*NL*
was
holding
forth
that
week
,
and
the
air
of
distinction
and
prosperity
*NL*
overawed
her
.
She
could
not
imagine
that
there
would
be
anything
in
such
*NL*
a
lofty
sphere
for
her
.
She
almost
trembled
at
the
audacity
which
might
*NL*
have
carried
her
on
to
a
terrible
rebuff
.
She
could
find
heart
only
to
*NL*
look
at
the
pictures
which
were
showy
and
then
walk
out
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
her
as
if
she
had
made
a
splendid
escape
and
that
it
would
be
foolhardy
*NL*
to
think
of
applying
in
that
quarter
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
experience
settled
her
hunting
for
one
day
.
She
looked
*NL*
around
elsewhere
,
but
it
was
from
the
outside
.
She
got
the
location
of
*NL*
several
playhouses
fixed
in
her
mind
--
notably
the
Grand
Opera
House
and
*NL*
McVickar
's
,
both
of
which
were
leading
in
attractions
--
and
then
came
*NL*
away
.
Her
spirits
were
materially
reduced
,
owing
to
the
newly
restored
*NL*
sense
of
magnitude
of
the
great
interests
and
the
insignificance
of
her
*NL*
claims
upon
society
,
such
as
she
understood
them
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
she
was
visited
by
Mrs.
Hale
,
whose
chatter
and
protracted
*NL*
stay
made
it
impossible
to
dwell
upon
her
predicament
or
the
fortune
*NL*
of
the
day
.
Before
retiring
,
however
,
she
sat
down
to
think
,
and
gave
*NL*
herself
up
to
the
most
gloomy
forebodings
.
Drouet
had
not
put
in
an
*NL*
appearance
.
She
had
had
no
word
from
any
quarter
,
she
had
spent
a
*NL*
dollar
of
her
precious
sum
in
procuring
food
and
paying
car
fare
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
she
would
not
endure
long
.
Besides
,
she
had
discovered
no
*NL*
resource
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
situation
her
thoughts
went
out
to
her
sister
in
Van
Buren
*NL*
Street
,
whom
she
had
not
seen
since
the
night
of
her
flight
,
and
to
her
*NL*
home
at
Columbia
City
,
which
seemed
now
a
part
of
something
that
could
*NL*
not
be
again
.
She
looked
for
no
refuge
in
that
direction
.
Nothing
but
*NL*
sorrow
was
brought
her
by
thoughts
of
Hurstwood
,
which
would
return
.
*NL*
That
he
could
have
chosen
to
dupe
her
in
so
ready
a
manner
seemed
a
*NL*
cruel
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tuesday
came
,
and
with
it
appropriate
indecision
and
speculation
.
She
*NL*
was
in
no
mood
,
after
her
failure
of
the
day
before
,
to
hasten
forth
*NL*
upon
her
work-seeking
errand
,
and
yet
she
rebuked
herself
for
what
she
*NL*
considered
her
weakness
the
day
before
.
Accordingly
she
started
out
to
*NL*
revisit
the
Chicago
Opera
House
,
but
possessed
scarcely
enough
courage
*NL*
to
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
manage
to
inquire
at
the
box-office
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Manager
of
the
company
or
the
house
?
''
asked
the
smartly
dressed
*NL*
individual
who
took
care
of
the
tickets
.
He
was
favourably
impressed
by
*NL*
Carrie
's
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
,
taken
back
by
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
see
the
manager
of
the
house
to-day
,
anyhow
,
''
volunteered
*NL*
the
young
man
.
``
He
's
out
of
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
noted
her
puzzled
look
,
and
then
added
:
``
What
is
it
you
wish
to
see
*NL*
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
about
getting
a
position
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
see
the
manager
of
the
company
,
''
he
returned
,
``
but
he
*NL*
is
n't
here
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
he
be
in
?
''
asked
Carrie
,
somewhat
relieved
by
this
*NL*
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
might
find
him
in
between
eleven
and
twelve
.
He
's
here
after
*NL*
two
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
thanked
him
and
walked
briskly
out
,
while
the
young
man
gazed
*NL*
after
her
through
one
of
the
side
windows
of
his
gilded
coop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-looking
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
and
proceeded
to
visions
of
*NL*
condescensions
on
her
part
which
were
exceedingly
flattering
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
principal
comedy
companies
of
the
day
was
playing
an
*NL*
engagement
at
the
Grand
Opera
House
.
Here
Carrie
asked
to
see
the
*NL*
manager
of
the
company
.
She
little
knew
the
trivial
authority
of
this
*NL*
individual
,
or
that
had
there
been
a
vacancy
an
actor
would
have
been
*NL*
sent
on
from
New
York
to
fill
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
office
is
upstairs
,
''
said
a
man
in
the
box-office
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
persons
were
in
the
manager
's
office
,
two
lounging
near
a
*NL*
window
,
another
talking
to
an
individual
sitting
at
a
roll-top
desk
--
the
*NL*
manager
.
Carrie
glanced
nervously
about
,
and
began
to
fear
that
she
*NL*
should
have
to
make
her
appeal
before
the
assembled
company
,
two
of
*NL*
whom
--
the
occupants
of
the
window
--
were
already
observing
her
carefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
do
it
,
''
the
manager
was
saying
;
``
it
's
a
rule
of
Mr.
Frohman
's
*NL*
never
to
allow
visitors
back
of
the
stage
.
No
,
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
timidly
waited
,
standing
.
There
were
chairs
,
but
no
one
motioned
*NL*
her
to
be
seated
.
The
individual
to
whom
the
manager
had
been
talking
*NL*
went
away
quite
crestfallen
.
That
luminary
gazed
earnestly
at
some
*NL*
papers
before
him
,
as
if
they
were
of
the
greatest
concern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
that
in
the
`
Herald
'
this
morning
about
Nat
Goodwin
,
*NL*
Harris
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
person
addressed
.
``
What
was
it
?
''
``
Made
quite
a
curtain
*NL*
address
at
Hooley
's
last
night
.
Better
look
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Harris
reached
over
to
a
table
and
began
to
look
for
the
``
Herald
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
the
manager
to
Carrie
,
apparently
noticing
her
for
*NL*
the
first
time
.
He
thought
he
was
going
to
be
held
up
for
free
tickets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
summoned
up
all
her
courage
,
which
was
little
at
best
.
She
*NL*
realised
that
she
was
a
novice
,
and
felt
as
if
a
rebuff
were
certain
.
Of
*NL*
this
she
was
so
sure
that
she
only
wished
now
to
pretend
she
had
called
*NL*
for
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
tell
me
how
to
go
about
getting
on
the
stage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
best
way
after
all
to
have
gone
about
the
matter
.
She
*NL*
was
interesting
,
in
a
manner
,
to
the
occupant
of
the
chair
,
and
the
*NL*
simplicity
of
her
request
and
attitude
took
his
fancy
.
He
smiled
,
as
did
*NL*
the
others
in
the
room
,
who
,
however
,
made
some
slight
effort
to
conceal
*NL*
their
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
answered
,
looking
her
brazenly
over
.
``
Have
you
ever
*NL*
had
any
experience
upon
the
stage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
``
I
have
taken
part
in
amateur
*NL*
performances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
she
had
to
make
some
sort
of
showing
in
order
to
retain
his
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
studied
for
the
stage
?
''
he
said
,
putting
on
an
air
intended
as
*NL*
much
to
impress
his
friends
with
his
discretion
as
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
answered
,
tipping
lazily
back
in
his
chair
*NL*
while
she
stood
before
him
.
``
What
makes
you
want
to
get
on
the
stage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
abashed
at
the
man
's
daring
,
but
could
only
smile
in
answer
to
*NL*
his
engaging
smirk
,
and
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
to
make
a
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
answered
,
rather
taken
by
her
trim
appearance
,
and
feeling
as
*NL*
if
he
might
scrape
up
an
acquaintance
with
her
.
``
That
's
a
good
reason
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
?
Well
,
Chicago
is
not
a
good
place
for
what
you
want
to
do
.
*NL*
You
ought
to
be
in
New
York
.
There
's
more
chance
there
.
You
could
hardly
*NL*
expect
to
get
started
out
here
.
''
Carrie
smiled
genially
,
grateful
that
*NL*
he
should
condescend
to
advise
her
even
so
much
.
He
noticed
the
smile
,
*NL*
and
put
a
slightly
different
construction
on
it
.
He
thought
he
saw
an
*NL*
easy
chance
for
a
little
flirtation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
he
said
,
pulling
a
chair
forward
from
the
side
of
his
desk
*NL*
and
dropping
his
voice
so
that
the
two
men
in
the
room
should
not
hear
.
*NL*
Those
two
gave
each
other
the
suggestion
of
a
wink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
be
going
,
Barney
,
''
said
one
,
breaking
away
and
so
addressing
*NL*
the
manager
.
``
See
you
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
the
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
remaining
individual
took
up
a
paper
as
if
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
have
any
idea
what
sort
of
part
you
would
like
to
get
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
manager
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
would
take
anything
to
begin
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
he
said
.
``
Do
you
live
here
in
the
city
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
smiled
most
blandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
tried
to
get
in
as
a
chorus
girl
?
''
he
asked
,
assuming
a
*NL*
more
confidential
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
began
to
feel
that
there
was
something
exuberant
and
unnatural
in
*NL*
his
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
most
girls
begin
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
who
go
on
the
stage
.
*NL*
It
's
a
good
way
to
get
experience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
turning
on
her
a
glance
of
the
companionable
and
persuasive
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
that
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
difficult
thing
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
but
there
's
always
a
chance
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
Then
,
as
if
he
suddenly
remembered
,
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
*NL*
consulted
it
.
``
I
've
an
appointment
at
two
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
've
got
to
*NL*
go
to
lunch
now
.
Would
you
care
to
come
and
dine
with
me
?
We
can
talk
it
*NL*
over
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Carrie
,
the
whole
motive
of
the
man
flashing
on
her
at
*NL*
once
.
``
I
have
an
engagement
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
too
bad
,
''
he
said
,
realising
that
he
had
been
a
little
*NL*
beforehand
in
his
offer
and
that
Carrie
was
about
to
go
away
.
``
Come
in
*NL*
later
.
I
may
know
of
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
she
answered
,
with
some
trepidation
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
good-looking
,
was
n't
she
?
''
said
the
manager
's
companion
,
who
*NL*
had
not
caught
all
the
details
of
the
game
he
had
played
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
in
a
way
,
''
said
the
other
,
sore
to
think
the
game
had
been
lost
.
*NL*
``
She
'd
never
make
an
actress
,
though
.
Just
another
chorus
girl
--
that
's
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
experience
nearly
destroyed
her
ambition
to
call
upon
the
*NL*
manager
at
the
Chicago
Opera
House
,
but
she
decided
to
do
so
after
a
*NL*
time
.
He
was
of
a
more
sedate
turn
of
mind
.
He
said
at
once
that
there
*NL*
was
no
opening
of
any
sort
,
and
seemed
to
consider
her
search
foolish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chicago
is
no
place
to
get
a
start
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
ought
to
be
in
New
*NL*
York
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
she
persisted
,
and
went
to
McVickar
's
,
where
she
could
not
find
*NL*
any
one
.
``
The
Old
Homestead
''
was
running
there
,
but
the
person
to
whom
*NL*
she
was
referred
was
not
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
little
expeditions
took
up
her
time
until
quite
four
o'clock
,
when
*NL*
she
was
weary
enough
to
go
home
.
She
felt
as
if
she
ought
to
continue
*NL*
and
inquire
elsewhere
,
but
the
results
so
far
were
too
dispiriting
.
She
*NL*
took
the
car
and
arrived
at
Ogden
Place
in
three-quarters
of
an
hour
,
*NL*
but
decided
to
ride
on
to
the
West
Side
branch
of
the
Post-office
,
where
*NL*
she
was
accustomed
to
receive
Hurstwood
's
letters
.
There
was
one
*NL*
there
now
,
written
Saturday
,
which
she
tore
open
and
read
with
mingled
*NL*
feelings
.
There
was
so
much
warmth
in
it
and
such
tense
complaint
at
her
*NL*
having
failed
to
meet
him
,
and
her
subsequent
silence
,
that
she
rather
*NL*
pitied
the
man
.
That
he
loved
her
was
evident
enough
.
That
he
had
wished
*NL*
and
dared
to
do
so
,
married
as
he
was
,
was
the
evil
.
She
felt
as
if
the
*NL*
thing
deserved
an
answer
,
and
consequently
decided
that
she
would
write
*NL*
and
let
him
know
that
she
knew
of
his
married
state
and
was
justly
*NL*
incensed
at
his
deception
.
She
would
tell
him
that
it
was
all
over
*NL*
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
her
room
,
the
wording
of
this
missive
occupied
her
for
some
time
,
for
*NL*
she
fell
to
the
task
at
once
.
It
was
most
difficult
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
need
to
have
me
explain
why
I
did
not
meet
you
,
''
she
wrote
*NL*
in
part
.
``
How
could
you
deceive
me
so
?
You
can
not
expect
me
to
have
*NL*
anything
more
to
do
with
you
.
I
would
n't
under
any
circumstances
.
Oh
,
*NL*
how
could
you
act
so
?
''
she
added
in
a
burst
of
feeling
.
``
You
have
*NL*
caused
me
more
misery
than
you
can
think
.
I
hope
you
will
get
over
your
*NL*
infatuation
for
me
.
We
must
not
meet
any
more
.
Good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
the
letter
the
next
morning
,
and
at
the
corner
dropped
it
*NL*
reluctantly
into
the
letter-box
,
still
uncertain
as
to
whether
she
*NL*
should
do
so
or
not
.
Then
she
took
the
car
and
went
down
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
dull
season
with
the
department
stores
,
but
she
was
*NL*
listened
to
with
more
consideration
than
was
usually
accorded
to
young
*NL*
women
applicants
,
owing
to
her
neat
and
attractive
appearance
.
She
was
*NL*
asked
the
same
old
questions
with
which
she
was
already
familiar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
do
?
Have
you
ever
worked
in
a
retail
store
before
?
Are
you
*NL*
experienced
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
The
Fair
,
See
and
Company
's
,
and
all
the
great
stores
it
was
much
the
*NL*
same
.
It
was
the
dull
season
,
she
might
come
in
a
little
later
,
possibly
*NL*
they
would
like
to
have
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
arrived
at
the
house
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
weary
and
*NL*
disheartened
,
she
discovered
that
Drouet
had
been
there
.
His
umbrella
*NL*
and
light
overcoat
were
gone
.
She
thought
she
missed
other
things
,
but
*NL*
could
not
be
sure
.
Everything
had
not
been
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
his
going
was
crystallising
into
staying
.
What
was
she
to
do
now
?
*NL*
Evidently
she
would
be
facing
the
world
in
the
same
old
way
within
a
day
*NL*
or
two
.
Her
clothes
would
get
poor
.
She
put
her
two
hands
together
*NL*
in
her
customary
expressive
way
and
pressed
her
fingers
.
Large
tears
*NL*
gathered
in
her
eyes
and
broke
hot
across
her
cheeks
.
She
was
alone
,
*NL*
very
much
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
really
had
called
,
but
it
was
with
a
very
different
mind
from
*NL*
that
which
Carrie
had
imagined
.
He
expected
to
find
her
,
to
justify
*NL*
his
return
by
claiming
that
he
came
to
get
the
remaining
portion
of
his
*NL*
wardrobe
,
and
before
he
got
away
again
to
patch
up
a
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
when
he
arrived
,
he
was
disappointed
to
find
Carrie
out
.
*NL*
He
trifled
about
,
hoping
that
she
was
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
and
*NL*
would
soon
return
.
He
constantly
listened
,
expecting
to
hear
her
foot
on
*NL*
the
stair
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
did
so
,
it
was
his
intention
to
make
believe
that
he
had
just
*NL*
come
in
and
was
disturbed
at
being
caught
.
Then
he
would
explain
his
*NL*
need
of
his
clothes
and
find
out
how
things
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wait
as
he
did
,
however
,
Carrie
did
not
come
.
From
pottering
around
*NL*
among
the
drawers
,
in
momentary
expectation
of
her
arrival
he
changed
*NL*
to
looking
out
of
the
window
,
and
from
that
to
resting
himself
in
the
*NL*
rocking-chair
.
Still
no
Carrie
.
He
began
to
grow
restless
and
lit
a
*NL*
cigar
.
After
that
he
walked
the
floor
.
Then
he
looked
out
of
the
window
*NL*
and
saw
clouds
gathering
.
He
remembered
an
appointment
at
three
.
He
*NL*
began
to
think
that
it
would
be
useless
to
wait
,
and
got
hold
of
his
*NL*
umbrella
and
light
coat
,
intending
to
take
these
things
,
any
way
.
It
*NL*
would
scare
her
,
he
hoped
.
To-morrow
he
would
come
back
for
the
others
.
*NL*
He
would
find
out
how
things
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
started
to
go
he
felt
truly
sorry
that
he
had
missed
her
.
There
*NL*
was
a
little
picture
of
her
on
the
wall
,
showing
her
arrayed
in
the
*NL*
little
jacket
he
had
first
bought
her
--
her
face
a
little
more
wistful
*NL*
than
he
had
seen
it
lately
.
He
was
really
touched
by
it
,
and
looked
into
*NL*
the
eyes
of
it
with
a
rather
rare
feeling
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
do
me
right
,
Cad
,
''
he
said
,
as
if
he
were
addressing
her
in
*NL*
the
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
to
the
door
,
took
a
good
look
around
and
went
out
.

Chapter

WHEN
WATERS
ENGULF
US
WE
REACH
FOR
A
STAR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
when
he
returned
from
his
disturbed
stroll
about
the
streets
,
*NL*
after
receiving
the
decisive
note
from
McGregor
,
James
and
Hay
,
that
*NL*
Hurstwood
found
the
letter
Carrie
had
written
him
that
morning
.
He
*NL*
thrilled
intensely
as
he
noted
the
handwriting
,
and
rapidly
tore
it
*NL*
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
he
thought
,
``
she
loves
me
or
she
would
not
have
written
to
me
at
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
slightly
depressed
at
the
tenor
of
the
note
for
the
first
few
*NL*
minutes
,
but
soon
recovered
.
``
She
would
n't
write
at
all
if
she
did
n't
*NL*
care
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
his
one
resource
against
the
depression
which
held
him
.
He
*NL*
could
extract
little
from
the
wording
of
the
letter
,
but
the
spirit
he
*NL*
thought
he
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
really
something
exceedingly
human
--
if
not
pathetic
--
in
his
*NL*
being
thus
relieved
by
a
clearly
worded
reproof
.
He
who
had
for
so
*NL*
long
remained
satisfied
with
himself
now
looked
outside
of
himself
for
*NL*
comfort
--
and
to
such
a
source
.
The
mystic
cords
of
affection
!
How
they
*NL*
bind
us
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colour
came
to
his
cheeks
.
For
the
moment
he
forgot
the
letter
from
*NL*
McGregor
,
James
and
Hay
.
If
he
could
only
have
Carrie
,
perhaps
he
could
*NL*
get
out
of
the
whole
entanglement
--
perhaps
it
would
not
matter
.
He
*NL*
would
n't
care
what
his
wife
did
with
herself
if
only
he
might
not
lose
*NL*
Carrie
.
He
stood
up
and
walked
about
,
dreaming
his
delightful
dream
of
a
*NL*
life
continued
with
this
lovely
possessor
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
,
however
,
before
the
old
worry
was
back
for
*NL*
consideration
,
and
with
it
what
weariness
!
He
thought
of
the
morrow
and
*NL*
the
suit
.
He
had
done
nothing
,
and
here
was
the
afternoon
slipping
away
.
*NL*
It
was
now
a
quarter
of
four
.
At
five
the
attorneys
would
have
gone
*NL*
home
.
He
still
had
the
morrow
until
noon
.
Even
as
he
thought
,
the
last
*NL*
fifteen
minutes
passed
away
and
it
was
five
.
Then
he
abandoned
the
*NL*
thought
of
seeing
them
any
more
that
day
and
turned
to
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
to
be
observed
that
the
man
did
not
justify
himself
to
himself
.
He
*NL*
was
not
troubling
about
that
.
His
whole
thought
was
the
possibility
of
*NL*
persuading
Carrie
.
Nothing
was
wrong
in
that
.
He
loved
her
dearly
.
Their
*NL*
mutual
happiness
depended
upon
it
.
Would
that
Drouet
were
only
away
!
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
thinking
thus
elatedly
,
he
remembered
that
he
wanted
some
*NL*
clean
linen
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
he
purchased
,
together
with
a
half-dozen
ties
,
and
went
to
the
*NL*
Palmer
House
.
As
he
entered
he
thought
he
saw
Drouet
ascending
the
*NL*
stairs
with
a
key
.
Surely
not
Drouet
!
Then
he
thought
,
perhaps
they
had
*NL*
changed
their
abode
temporarily
.
He
went
straight
up
to
the
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Drouet
stopping
here
?
''
he
asked
of
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
is
,
''
said
the
latter
,
consulting
his
private
registry
list
.
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
''
exclaimed
Hurstwood
,
otherwise
concealing
his
*NL*
astonishment
.
``
Alone
?
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
turned
away
and
set
his
lips
so
as
best
to
express
and
conceal
*NL*
his
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
that
?
''
he
thought
.
``
They
've
had
a
row
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hastened
to
his
room
with
rising
spirits
and
changed
his
linen
.
As
he
*NL*
did
so
,
he
made
up
his
mind
that
if
Carrie
was
alone
,
or
if
she
had
gone
*NL*
to
another
place
,
it
behooved
him
to
find
out
.
He
decided
to
call
at
*NL*
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
I
'll
do
,
''
he
thought
.
``
I
'll
go
to
the
door
and
ask
if
Mr.
*NL*
Drouet
is
at
home
.
That
will
bring
out
whether
he
is
there
or
not
and
*NL*
where
Carrie
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
almost
moved
to
some
muscular
display
as
he
thought
of
it
.
He
*NL*
decided
to
go
immediately
after
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
coming
down
from
his
room
at
six
,
he
looked
carefully
about
to
see
*NL*
if
Drouet
was
present
and
then
went
out
to
lunch
.
He
could
scarcely
eat
,
*NL*
however
,
he
was
so
anxious
to
be
about
his
errand
.
Before
starting
he
*NL*
thought
it
well
to
discover
where
Drouet
would
be
,
and
returned
to
his
*NL*
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Mr.
Drouet
gone
out
?
''
he
asked
of
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
the
latter
,
``
he
's
in
his
room
.
Do
you
wish
to
send
up
a
*NL*
card
?
''
``
No
,
I
'll
call
around
later
,
''
answered
Hurstwood
,
and
strolled
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
Madison
car
and
went
direct
to
Ogden
Place
this
time
walking
*NL*
boldly
up
to
the
door
.
The
chambermaid
answered
his
knock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Drouet
in
?
''
said
Hurstwood
blandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
out
of
the
city
,
''
said
the
girl
,
who
had
heard
Carrie
tell
this
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Hale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mrs.
Drouet
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
has
gone
to
the
theatre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
''
said
Hurstwood
,
considerably
taken
back
;
then
,
as
if
*NL*
burdened
with
something
important
,
``
You
do
n't
know
to
which
theatre
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
really
had
no
idea
where
she
had
gone
,
but
not
liking
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
and
wishing
to
cause
him
trouble
,
answered
:
``
Yes
,
Hooley
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
returned
the
manager
,
and
,
tipping
his
hat
slightly
,
went
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
look
in
at
Hooley
's
,
''
thought
he
,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
*NL*
not
.
Before
he
had
reached
the
central
portion
of
the
city
he
thought
*NL*
the
whole
matter
over
and
decided
it
would
be
useless
.
As
much
as
he
*NL*
longed
to
see
Carrie
,
he
knew
she
would
be
with
some
one
and
did
not
*NL*
wish
to
intrude
with
his
plea
there
.
A
little
later
he
might
do
so
--
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
Only
in
the
morning
he
had
the
lawyer
question
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
pilgrimage
threw
quite
a
wet
blanket
upon
his
rising
*NL*
spirits
.
He
was
soon
down
again
to
his
old
worry
,
and
reached
the
resort
*NL*
anxious
to
find
relief
.
Quite
a
company
of
gentlemen
were
making
the
*NL*
place
lively
with
their
conversation
.
A
group
of
Cook
County
politicians
*NL*
were
conferring
about
a
round
cherry-wood
table
in
the
rear
portion
of
*NL*
the
room
.
Several
young
merrymakers
were
chattering
at
the
bar
before
*NL*
making
a
belated
visit
to
the
theatre
.
A
shabbily-genteel
individual
,
*NL*
with
a
red
nose
and
an
old
high
hat
,
was
sipping
a
quiet
glass
of
ale
*NL*
alone
at
one
end
of
the
bar
.
Hurstwood
nodded
to
the
politicians
and
*NL*
went
into
his
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
ten
o'clock
a
friend
of
his
,
Mr.
Frank
L.
Taintor
,
a
local
sport
*NL*
and
racing
man
,
dropped
in
,
and
seeing
Hurstwood
alone
in
his
office
*NL*
came
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,

!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
,
Frank
?
''
said
Hurstwood
,
somewhat
relieved
by
the
sight
of
*NL*
him
.
``
Sit
down
,
''
and
he
motioned
him
to
one
of
the
chairs
in
the
little
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
George
?
''
asked
Taintor
.
``
You
look
a
little
glum
.
*NL*
Have
n't
lost
at
the
track
,
have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
feeling
very
well
to-night
.
I
had
a
slight
cold
the
other
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
whiskey
,
George
,
''
said
Taintor
.
``
You
ought
to
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
still
conferring
there
,
several
other
of
Hurstwood
's
*NL*
friends
entered
,
and
not
long
after
eleven
,
the
theatres
being
out
,
some
*NL*
actors
began
to
drop
in
--
among
them
some
notabilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
began
one
of
those
pointless
social
conversations
so
common
in
*NL*
American
resorts
where
the
would-be
gilded
attempt
to
rub
off
gilt
from
*NL*
those
who
have
it
in
abundance
.
If
Hurstwood
had
one
leaning
,
it
was
*NL*
toward
notabilities
.
He
considered
that
,
if
anywhere
,
he
belonged
among
*NL*
them
.
He
was
too
proud
to
toady
,
too
keen
not
to
strictly
observe
the
*NL*
plane
he
occupied
when
there
were
those
present
who
did
not
appreciate
*NL*
him
,
but
,
in
situations
like
the
present
,
where
he
could
shine
as
a
*NL*
gentleman
and
be
received
without
equivocation
as
a
friend
and
equal
*NL*
among
men
of
known
ability
,
he
was
most
delighted
.
It
was
on
such
*NL*
occasions
,
if
ever
,
that
he
would
``
take
something
.
''
When
the
social
*NL*
flavour
was
strong
enough
he
would
even
unbend
to
the
extent
of
drinking
*NL*
glass
for
glass
with
his
associates
,
punctiliously
observing
his
turn
*NL*
to
pay
as
if
he
were
an
outsider
like
the
others
.
If
he
ever
approached
*NL*
intoxication
--
or
rather
that
ruddy
warmth
and
comfortableness
which
*NL*
precedes
the
more
sloven
state
--
it
was
when
individuals
such
as
these
*NL*
were
gathered
about
him
,
when
he
was
one
of
a
circle
of
chatting
*NL*
celebrities
.
To-night
,
disturbed
as
was
his
state
,
he
was
rather
*NL*
relieved
to
find
company
,
and
now
that
notabilities
were
gathered
,
he
*NL*
laid
aside
his
troubles
for
the
nonce
,
and
joined
in
right
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
before
the
imbibing
began
to
tell
.
Stories
began
to
crop
*NL*
up
--
those
ever-enduring
,
droll
stories
which
form
the
major
portion
of
*NL*
the
conversation
among
American
men
under
such
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twelve
o'clock
arrived
,
the
hour
for
closing
,
and
with
it
the
company
*NL*
took
leave
.
Hurstwood
shook
hands
with
them
most
cordially
.
He
was
very
*NL*
roseate
physically
.
He
had
arrived
at
that
state
where
his
mind
,
*NL*
though
clear
,
was
,
nevertheless
,
warm
in
its
fancies
.
He
felt
as
if
his
*NL*
troubles
were
not
very
serious
.
Going
into
his
office
,
he
began
to
turn
*NL*
over
certain
accounts
,
awaiting
the
departure
of
the
bartenders
and
the
*NL*
cashier
,
who
soon
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
manager
's
duty
,
as
well
as
his
custom
,
after
all
were
gone
*NL*
to
see
that
everything
was
safely
closed
up
for
the
night
.
As
a
rule
,
*NL*
no
money
except
the
cash
taken
in
after
banking
hours
was
kept
about
*NL*
the
place
,
and
that
was
locked
in
the
safe
by
the
cashier
,
who
,
with
the
*NL*
owners
,
was
joint
keeper
of
the
secret
combination
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
*NL*
Hurstwood
nightly
took
the
precaution
to
try
the
cash
drawers
and
the
*NL*
safe
in
order
to
see
that
they
were
tightly
closed
.
Then
he
would
lock
*NL*
his
own
little
office
and
set
the
proper
light
burning
near
the
safe
,
*NL*
after
which
he
would
take
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
in
his
experience
had
he
found
anything
out
of
order
,
but
*NL*
to-night
,
after
shutting
down
his
desk
,
he
came
out
and
tried
the
safe
.
*NL*
His
way
was
to
give
a
sharp
pull
.
This
time
the
door
responded
.
He
was
*NL*
slightly
surprised
at
that
,
and
looking
in
found
the
money
cases
as
left
*NL*
for
the
day
,
apparently
unprotected
.
His
first
thought
was
,
of
course
,
*NL*
to
inspect
the
drawers
and
shut
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
speak
to
Mayhew
about
this
to-morrow
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
had
certainly
imagined
upon
going
out
a
half-hour
before
*NL*
that
he
had
turned
the
knob
on
the
door
so
as
to
spring
the
lock
.
He
had
*NL*
never
failed
to
do
so
before
.
But
to-night
Mayhew
had
other
thoughts
.
He
*NL*
had
been
revolving
the
problem
of
a
business
of
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
look
in
here
,
''
thought
the
manager
,
pulling
out
the
money
*NL*
drawers
.
He
did
not
know
why
he
wished
to
look
in
there
.
It
was
quite
a
*NL*
superfluous
action
,
which
another
time
might
not
have
happened
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
did
so
,
a
layer
of
bills
,
in
parcels
of
a
thousand
,
such
as
banks
*NL*
issue
,
caught
his
eye
.
He
could
not
tell
how
much
they
represented
,
but
*NL*
paused
to
view
them
.
Then
he
pulled
out
the
second
of
the
cash
drawers
.
*NL*
In
that
were
the
receipts
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
ever
left
any
money
this
way
,
''
his
*NL*
mind
said
to
itself
.
``
They
must
have
forgotten
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
other
drawer
and
paused
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
them
,
''
said
a
voice
in
his
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
hand
into
the
first
of
the
boxes
and
lifted
the
stack
,
*NL*
letting
the
separate
parcels
fall
.
They
were
bills
of
fifty
and
one
*NL*
hundred
dollars
done
in
packages
of
a
thousand
.
He
thought
he
counted
*NL*
ten
such
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
I
shut
the
safe
?
''
his
mind
said
to
itself
,
lingering
.
``
What
*NL*
makes
me
pause
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
answer
there
came
the
strangest
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
have
ten
thousand
dollars
in
ready
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lo
,
the
manager
remembered
that
he
had
never
had
so
much
.
All
his
*NL*
property
had
been
slowly
accumulated
,
and
now
his
wife
owned
that
.
He
*NL*
was
worth
more
than
forty
thousand
,
all
told
--
but
she
would
get
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
puzzled
as
he
thought
of
these
things
,
then
pushed
in
the
drawers
*NL*
and
closed
the
door
,
pausing
with
his
hand
upon
the
knob
,
which
might
so
*NL*
easily
lock
it
all
beyond
temptation
.
Still
he
paused
.
Finally
he
went
*NL*
to
the
windows
and
pulled
down
the
curtains
.
Then
he
tried
the
door
,
*NL*
which
he
had
previously
locked
.
What
was
this
thing
,
making
him
*NL*
suspicious
?
Why
did
he
wish
to
move
about
so
quietly
.
He
came
back
to
*NL*
the
end
of
the
counter
as
if
to
rest
his
arm
and
think
.
Then
he
went
and
*NL*
unlocked
his
little
office
door
and
turned
on
the
light
.
He
also
opened
*NL*
his
desk
,
sitting
down
before
it
,
only
to
think
strange
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
safe
is
open
,
''
said
a
voice
.
``
There
is
just
the
least
little
crack
*NL*
in
it
.
The
lock
has
not
been
sprung
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
floundered
among
a
jumble
of
thoughts
.
Now
all
the
*NL*
entanglement
of
the
day
came
back
.
Also
the
thought
that
here
was
a
*NL*
solution
.
That
money
would
do
it
.
If
he
had
that
and
Carrie
.
He
rose
up
*NL*
and
stood
stock-still
,
looking
at
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
it
?
''
his
mind
asked
,
and
for
answer
he
put
his
hand
slowly
*NL*
up
and
scratched
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
was
no
fool
to
be
led
blindly
away
by
such
an
errant
*NL*
proposition
as
this
,
but
his
situation
was
peculiar
.
Wine
was
in
his
*NL*
veins
.
It
had
crept
up
into
his
head
and
given
him
a
warm
view
of
the
*NL*
situation
.
It
also
coloured
the
possibilities
of
ten
thousand
for
him
.
*NL*
He
could
see
great
opportunities
with
that
.
He
could
get
Carrie
.
Oh
,
*NL*
yes
,
he
could
!
He
could
get
rid
of
his
wife
.
That
letter
,
too
,
was
*NL*
waiting
discussion
to-morrow
morning
.
He
would
not
need
to
answer
that
.
*NL*
He
went
back
to
the
safe
and
put
his
hand
on
the
knob
.
Then
he
pulled
*NL*
the
door
open
and
took
the
drawer
with
the
money
quite
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
it
once
out
and
before
him
,
it
seemed
a
foolish
thing
to
think
*NL*
about
leaving
it
.
Certainly
it
would
.
Why
,
he
could
live
quietly
with
*NL*
Carrie
for
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
!
what
was
that
?
For
the
first
time
he
was
tense
,
as
if
a
stern
hand
*NL*
had
been
laid
upon
his
shoulder
.
He
looked
fearfully
around
.
Not
a
soul
*NL*
was
present
.
Not
a
sound
.
Some
one
was
shuffling
by
on
the
sidewalk
.
He
*NL*
took
the
box
and
the
money
and
put
it
back
in
the
safe
.
Then
he
partly
*NL*
closed
the
door
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
those
who
have
never
wavered
in
conscience
,
the
predicament
of
the
*NL*
individual
whose
mind
is
less
strongly
constituted
and
who
trembles
*NL*
in
the
balance
between
duty
and
desire
is
scarcely
appreciable
,
unless
*NL*
graphically
portrayed
.
Those
who
have
never
heard
that
solemn
voice
of
*NL*
the
ghostly
clock
which
ticks
with
awful
distinctness
,
``
thou
shalt
,
''
*NL*
``
thou
shalt
not
,
''
``
thou
shalt
,
''
``
thou
shalt
not
,
''
are
in
no
position
to
*NL*
judge
.
Not
alone
in
sensitive
,
highly
organised
natures
is
such
a
mental
*NL*
conflict
possible
.
The
dullest
specimen
of
humanity
,
when
drawn
*NL*
by
desire
toward
evil
,
is
recalled
by
a
sense
of
right
,
which
is
*NL*
proportionate
in
power
and
strength
to
his
evil
tendency
.
We
must
*NL*
remember
that
it
may
not
be
a
knowledge
of
right
,
for
no
knowledge
of
*NL*
right
is
predicated
of
the
animal
's
instinctive
recoil
at
evil
.
Men
*NL*
are
still
led
by
instinct
before
they
are
regulated
by
knowledge
.
It
*NL*
is
instinct
which
recalls
the
criminal
--
it
is
instinct
-LRB-
where
highly
*NL*
organised
reasoning
is
absent
-RRB-
which
gives
the
criminal
his
feeling
of
*NL*
danger
,
his
fear
of
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
every
first
adventure
,
then
,
into
some
untried
evil
,
the
mind
wavers
.
*NL*
The
clock
of
thought
ticks
out
its
wish
and
its
denial
.
To
those
who
*NL*
have
never
experienced
such
a
mental
dilemma
,
the
following
will
appeal
*NL*
on
the
simple
ground
of
revelation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Hurstwood
put
the
money
back
,
his
nature
again
resumed
its
ease
and
*NL*
daring
.
No
one
had
observed
him
.
He
was
quite
alone
.
No
one
could
tell
*NL*
what
he
wished
to
do
.
He
could
work
this
thing
out
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
imbibation
of
the
evening
had
not
yet
worn
off
.
Moist
as
was
his
*NL*
brow
,
tremble
as
did
his
hand
once
after
the
nameless
fright
,
he
was
*NL*
still
flushed
with
the
fumes
of
liquor
.
He
scarcely
noticed
that
the
*NL*
time
was
passing
.
He
went
over
his
situation
once
again
,
his
eye
always
*NL*
seeing
the
money
in
a
lump
,
his
mind
always
seeing
what
it
would
do
.
He
*NL*
strolled
into
his
little
room
,
then
to
the
door
,
then
to
the
safe
again
.
*NL*
He
put
his
hand
on
the
knob
and
opened
it
.
There
was
the
money
!
Surely
*NL*
no
harm
could
come
from
looking
at
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
out
the
drawer
again
and
lifted
the
bills
.
They
were
so
smooth
,
*NL*
so
compact
,
so
portable
.
How
little
they
made
,
after
all
.
He
decided
he
*NL*
would
take
them
.
Yes
,
he
would
.
He
would
put
them
in
his
pocket
.
Then
he
*NL*
looked
at
that
and
saw
they
would
not
go
there
.
His
hand
satchel
!
To
be
*NL*
sure
,
his
hand
satchel
.
They
would
go
in
that
--
all
of
it
would
.
No
one
*NL*
would
think
anything
of
it
either
.
He
went
into
the
little
office
and
*NL*
took
it
from
the
shelf
in
the
corner
.
Now
he
set
it
upon
his
desk
and
*NL*
went
out
toward
the
safe
.
For
some
reason
he
did
not
want
to
fill
it
out
*NL*
in
the
big
room
.
First
he
brought
the
bills
and
then
the
loose
receipts
*NL*
of
the
day
.
He
would
take
it
all
.
He
put
the
empty
drawers
back
and
*NL*
pushed
the
iron
door
almost
to
,
then
stood
beside
it
meditating
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wavering
of
a
mind
under
such
circumstances
is
an
almost
*NL*
inexplicable
thing
,
and
yet
it
is
absolutely
true
.
Hurstwood
could
not
*NL*
bring
himself
to
act
definitely
.
He
wanted
to
think
about
it
--
to
ponder
*NL*
over
it
,
to
decide
whether
it
were
best
.
He
was
drawn
by
such
a
keen
*NL*
desire
for
Carrie
,
driven
by
such
a
state
of
turmoil
in
his
own
affairs
*NL*
that
he
thought
constantly
it
would
be
best
,
and
yet
he
wavered
.
He
did
*NL*
not
know
what
evil
might
result
from
it
to
him
--
how
soon
he
might
come
*NL*
to
grief
.
The
true
ethics
of
the
situation
never
once
occurred
to
him
,
*NL*
and
never
would
have
,
under
any
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
all
the
money
in
the
handbag
,
a
revulsion
of
feeling
seized
*NL*
him
.
He
would
not
do
it
--
no
!
Think
of
what
a
scandal
it
would
make
.
The
*NL*
police
!
They
would
be
after
him
.
He
would
have
to
fly
,
and
where
?
Oh
,
*NL*
the
terror
of
being
a
fugitive
from
justice
!
He
took
out
the
two
boxes
*NL*
and
put
all
the
money
back
.
In
his
excitement
he
forgot
what
he
was
*NL*
doing
,
and
put
the
sums
in
the
wrong
boxes
.
As
he
pushed
the
door
to
,
*NL*
he
thought
he
remembered
doing
it
wrong
and
opened
the
door
again
.
There
*NL*
were
the
two
boxes
mixed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
them
out
and
straightened
the
matter
,
but
now
the
terror
had
*NL*
gone
.
Why
be
afraid
?
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
money
was
in
his
hand
the
lock
clicked
.
It
had
sprung
!
Did
*NL*
he
do
it
?
He
grabbed
at
the
knob
and
pulled
vigorously
.
It
had
closed
.
*NL*
Heavens
!
he
was
in
for
it
now
,
sure
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
he
realised
that
the
safe
was
locked
for
a
surety
,
the
sweat
*NL*
burst
out
upon
his
brow
and
he
trembled
violently
.
He
looked
about
him
*NL*
and
decided
instantly
.
There
was
no
delaying
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Supposing
I
do
lay
it
on
the
top
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
go
away
,
they
'll
*NL*
know
who
took
it
.
I
'm
the
last
to
close
up
.
Besides
,
other
things
will
*NL*
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
once
he
became
the
man
of
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
get
out
of
this
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hurried
into
his
little
room
,
took
down
his
light
overcoat
and
hat
,
*NL*
locked
his
desk
,
and
grabbed
the
satchel
.
Then
he
turned
out
all
but
one
*NL*
light
and
opened
the
door
.
He
tried
to
put
on
his
old
assured
air
,
but
*NL*
it
was
almost
gone
.
He
was
repenting
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
n't
done
that
,
''
he
said
.
``
That
was
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
steadily
down
the
street
,
greeting
a
night
watchman
whom
*NL*
he
knew
who
was
trying
doors
.
He
must
get
out
of
the
city
,
and
that
*NL*
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
how
the
trains
run
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
looked
.
It
was
nearly
half-past
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
first
drugstore
he
stopped
,
seeing
a
long-distance
telephone
*NL*
booth
inside
.
It
was
a
famous
drugstore
,
and
contained
one
of
the
first
*NL*
private
telephone
booths
ever
erected
.
``
I
want
to
use
your
`
phone
a
*NL*
minute
,
''
he
said
to
the
night
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
1643
,
''
he
called
to
Central
,
after
looking
up
the
Michigan
*NL*
Central
depot
number
.
Soon
he
got
the
ticket
agent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
the
trains
leave
here
for
Detroit
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
explained
the
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
with
a
sleeper
.
Yes
,
there
is
,
too
,
''
he
added
.
``
There
is
a
mail
*NL*
train
out
of
here
at
three
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
What
time
does
that
get
to
Detroit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thinking
if
he
could
only
get
there
and
cross
the
river
into
*NL*
Canada
,
he
could
take
his
time
about
getting
to
Montreal
.
He
was
*NL*
relieved
to
learn
that
it
would
reach
there
by
noon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mayhew
wo
n't
open
the
safe
till
nine
,
''
he
thought
.
``
They
ca
n't
get
on
*NL*
my
track
before
noon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
thought
of
Carrie
.
With
what
speed
must
he
get
her
,
if
he
got
*NL*
her
at
all
.
She
would
have
to
come
along
.
He
jumped
into
the
nearest
cab
*NL*
standing
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Ogden
Place
,
''
he
said
sharply
.
``
I
'll
give
you
a
dollar
more
if
you
*NL*
make
good
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cabby
beat
his
horse
into
a
sort
of
imitation
gallop
which
was
*NL*
fairly
fast
,
however
.
On
the
way
Hurstwood
thought
what
to
do
.
Reaching
*NL*
the
number
,
he
hurried
up
the
steps
and
did
not
spare
the
bell
in
waking
*NL*
the
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mrs.
Drouet
in
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
astonished
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
her
to
dress
and
come
to
the
door
at
once
.
Her
husband
is
in
the
*NL*
hospital
,
injured
,
and
wants
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
girl
hurried
upstairs
,
convinced
by
the
man
's
strained
and
*NL*
emphatic
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Carrie
,
lighting
the
gas
and
searching
for
her
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Drouet
is
hurt
and
in
the
hospital
.
He
wants
to
see
you
.
The
cab
's
*NL*
downstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
dressed
very
rapidly
,
and
soon
appeared
below
,
forgetting
*NL*
everything
save
the
necessities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drouet
is
hurt
,
''
said
Hurstwood
quickly
.
``
He
wants
to
see
you
.
Come
*NL*
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
so
bewildered
that
she
swallowed
the
whole
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
in
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
helping
her
and
jumping
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cabby
began
to
turn
the
horse
around
.
``
Michigan
Central
depot
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
standing
up
and
speaking
so
low
that
Carrie
could
not
hear
,
``
as
*NL*
fast
as
you
can
go
.

Chapter
XXVIII
.
A
PILGRIM
,
AN
OUTLAW
--
THE
SPIRIT
DETAINED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
cab
had
not
travelled
a
short
block
before
Carrie
,
settling
herself
*NL*
and
thoroughly
waking
in
the
night
atmosphere
,
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
him
?
Is
he
hurt
badly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
anything
very
serious
,
''
Hurstwood
said
solemnly
.
He
was
very
*NL*
much
disturbed
over
his
own
situation
,
and
now
that
he
had
Carrie
with
*NL*
him
,
he
only
wanted
to
get
safely
out
of
reach
of
the
law
.
Therefore
he
*NL*
was
in
no
mood
for
anything
save
such
words
as
would
further
his
plans
*NL*
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
did
not
forget
that
there
was
something
to
be
settled
between
*NL*
her
and
Hurstwood
,
but
the
thought
was
ignored
in
her
agitation
.
The
one
*NL*
thing
was
to
finish
this
strange
pilgrimage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Way
out
on
the
South
Side
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
We
'll
have
to
take
the
*NL*
train
.
It
's
the
quickest
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
said
nothing
,
and
the
horse
gambolled
on
.
The
weirdness
of
the
*NL*
city
by
night
held
her
attention
.
She
looked
at
the
long
receding
rows
*NL*
of
lamps
and
studied
the
dark
,
silent
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
he
hurt
himself
?
''
she
asked
--
meaning
what
was
the
nature
of
his
*NL*
injuries
.
Hurstwood
understood
.
He
hated
to
lie
any
more
than
necessary
,
*NL*
and
yet
he
wanted
no
protests
until
he
was
out
of
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
exactly
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
just
called
me
up
to
go
and
get
*NL*
you
and
bring
you
out
.
They
said
there
was
n't
any
need
for
alarm
,
but
*NL*
that
I
should
n't
fail
to
bring
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
's
serious
manner
convinced
Carrie
,
and
she
became
silent
,
*NL*
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
examined
his
watch
and
urged
the
man
to
hurry
.
For
one
in
so
*NL*
delicate
a
position
he
was
exceedingly
cool
.
He
could
only
think
of
how
*NL*
needful
it
was
to
make
the
train
and
get
quietly
away
.
Carrie
seemed
*NL*
quite
tractable
,
and
he
congratulated
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
due
time
they
reached
the
depot
,
and
after
helping
her
out
he
handed
*NL*
the
man
a
five-dollar
bill
and
hurried
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wait
here
,
''
he
said
to
Carrie
,
when
they
reached
the
waiting-room
,
*NL*
``
while
I
get
the
tickets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
much
time
to
catch
that
train
for
Detroit
?
''
he
asked
of
the
*NL*
agent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
minutes
,
''
said
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paid
for
two
tickets
as
circumspectly
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
far
?
''
said
Carrie
,
as
he
hurried
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
,
''
he
said
.
``
We
must
get
right
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pushed
her
before
him
at
the
gate
,
stood
between
her
and
the
ticket
*NL*
man
while
the
latter
punched
their
tickets
,
so
that
she
could
not
see
,
*NL*
and
then
hurried
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
line
of
express
and
passenger
cars
and
one
or
two
*NL*
common
day
coaches
.
As
the
train
had
only
recently
been
made
up
and
few
*NL*
passengers
were
expected
,
there
were
only
one
or
two
brakemen
waiting
.
*NL*
They
entered
the
rear
day
coach
and
sat
down
.
Almost
immediately
,
``
All
*NL*
aboard
,
''
resounded
faintly
from
the
outside
,
and
the
train
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
began
to
think
it
was
a
little
bit
curious
--
this
going
to
a
*NL*
depot
--
but
said
nothing
.
The
whole
incident
was
so
out
of
the
natural
*NL*
that
she
did
not
attach
too
much
weight
to
anything
she
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
have
you
been
?
''
asked
Hurstwood
gently
,
for
he
now
breathed
easier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
was
so
disturbed
that
she
could
not
bring
*NL*
a
proper
attitude
to
bear
in
the
matter
.
She
was
still
nervous
to
reach
*NL*
Drouet
and
see
what
could
be
the
matter
.
Hurstwood
contemplated
her
and
*NL*
felt
this
.
He
was
not
disturbed
that
it
should
be
so
.
He
did
not
trouble
*NL*
because
she
was
moved
sympathetically
in
the
matter
.
It
was
one
of
the
*NL*
qualities
in
her
which
pleased
him
exceedingly
.
He
was
only
thinking
how
*NL*
he
should
explain
.
Even
this
was
not
the
most
serious
thing
in
his
mind
,
*NL*
however
.
His
own
deed
and
present
flight
were
the
great
shadows
which
*NL*
weighed
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fool
I
was
to
do
that
,
''
he
said
over
and
over
.
``
What
a
mistake
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
sober
senses
,
he
could
scarcely
realise
that
the
thing
had
been
*NL*
done
.
He
could
not
begin
to
feel
that
he
was
a
fugitive
from
justice
.
*NL*
He
had
often
read
of
such
things
,
and
had
thought
they
must
be
terrible
,
*NL*
but
now
that
the
thing
was
upon
him
,
he
only
sat
and
looked
into
the
*NL*
past
.
The
future
was
a
thing
which
concerned
the
Canadian
line
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
reach
that
.
As
for
the
rest
he
surveyed
his
actions
for
the
*NL*
evening
,
and
counted
them
parts
of
a
great
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
he
said
,
``
what
could
I
have
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
would
decide
to
make
the
best
of
it
,
and
would
begin
to
do
so
*NL*
by
starting
the
whole
inquiry
over
again
.
It
was
a
fruitless
,
harassing
*NL*
round
,
and
left
him
in
a
queer
mood
to
deal
with
the
proposition
he
had
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
clacked
through
the
yards
along
the
lake
front
,
and
ran
rather
*NL*
slowly
to
Twenty-fourth
Street
.
Brakes
and
signals
were
visible
without
.
*NL*
The
engine
gave
short
calls
with
its
whistle
,
and
frequently
the
bell
*NL*
rang
.
Several
brakemen
came
through
,
bearing
lanterns
.
They
were
locking
*NL*
the
vestibules
and
putting
the
cars
in
order
for
a
long
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
it
began
to
gain
speed
,
and
Carrie
saw
the
silent
streets
*NL*
flashing
by
in
rapid
succession
.
The
engine
also
began
its
whistle-calls
*NL*
of
four
parts
,
with
which
it
signalled
danger
to
important
crossings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
very
far
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
``
Not
so
very
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
He
could
*NL*
hardly
repress
a
smile
at
her
simplicity
.
He
wanted
to
explain
and
*NL*
conciliate
her
,
but
he
also
wanted
to
be
well
out
of
Chicago
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
lapse
of
another
half-hour
it
became
apparent
to
Carrie
that
it
*NL*
was
quite
a
run
to
wherever
he
was
taking
her
,
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
in
Chicago
?
''
she
asked
nervously
.
They
were
now
far
beyond
the
*NL*
city
limits
,
and
the
train
was
scudding
across
the
Indiana
line
at
a
*NL*
great
rate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
,
``
not
where
we
are
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
in
the
way
he
said
this
which
aroused
her
in
an
*NL*
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
pretty
brow
began
to
contract
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
going
to
see
Charlie
,
are
n't
we
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
the
time
was
up
.
An
explanation
might
as
well
come
now
as
*NL*
later
.
Therefore
,
he
shook
his
head
in
the
most
gentle
negative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
Carrie
.
She
was
nonplussed
at
the
possibility
of
the
errand
*NL*
being
different
from
what
she
had
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
looked
at
her
in
the
most
kindly
and
mollifying
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
where
are
you
taking
me
,
then
?
''
she
asked
,
her
voice
showing
the
*NL*
quality
of
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
Carrie
,
if
you
'll
be
quiet
.
I
want
you
to
come
along
*NL*
with
me
to
another
city
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Carrie
,
her
voice
rising
into
a
weak
cry
.
``
Let
me
off
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
go
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
quite
appalled
at
the
man
's
audacity
.
This
was
something
which
*NL*
had
never
for
a
moment
entered
her
head
.
Her
one
thought
now
was
to
get
*NL*
off
and
away
.
If
only
the
flying
train
could
be
stopped
,
the
terrible
*NL*
trick
would
be
amended
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
arose
and
tried
to
push
out
into
the
aisle
--
anywhere
.
She
knew
she
*NL*
had
to
do
something
.
Hurstwood
laid
a
gentle
hand
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
still
,
Carrie
,
''
he
said
.
``
Sit
still
.
It
wo
n't
do
you
any
good
*NL*
to
get
up
here
.
Listen
to
me
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
.
Wait
a
*NL*
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
pushing
at
his
knees
,
but
he
only
pulled
her
back
.
No
one
saw
*NL*
this
little
altercation
,
for
very
few
persons
were
in
the
car
,
and
they
*NL*
were
attempting
to
doze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
was
,
nevertheless
,
complying
against
her
*NL*
will
.
``
Let
me
go
,
''
she
said
.
``
How
dare
you
?
''
and
large
tears
began
to
*NL*
gather
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
now
fully
aroused
to
the
immediate
difficulty
,
and
ceased
*NL*
to
think
of
his
own
situation
.
He
must
do
something
with
this
girl
,
or
*NL*
she
would
cause
him
trouble
.
He
tried
the
art
of
persuasion
with
all
his
*NL*
powers
aroused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
now
,
Carrie
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
must
n't
act
this
way
.
I
did
n't
*NL*
mean
to
hurt
your
feelings
.
I
do
n't
want
to
do
anything
to
make
you
feel
*NL*
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
sobbed
Carrie
,
``
oh
,
oh
--
oo
--
o
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
must
n't
cry
.
Wo
n't
you
listen
to
me
?
*NL*
Listen
to
me
a
minute
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
why
I
came
to
do
this
thing
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
help
it
.
I
assure
you
I
could
n't
.
Wo
n't
you
listen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
sobs
disturbed
him
so
that
he
was
quite
sure
she
did
not
hear
a
word
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
listen
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
,
flashing
up
.
``
I
want
you
to
take
me
out
of
*NL*
this
,
or
I
'll
tell
the
conductor
.
I
wo
n't
go
with
you
.
It
's
a
shame
,
''
*NL*
and
again
sobs
of
fright
cut
off
her
desire
for
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
listened
with
some
astonishment
.
He
felt
that
she
had
just
*NL*
cause
for
feeling
as
she
did
,
and
yet
he
wished
that
he
could
straighten
*NL*
this
thing
out
quickly
.
Shortly
the
conductor
would
come
through
for
the
*NL*
tickets
.
He
wanted
no
noise
,
no
trouble
of
any
kind
.
Before
everything
*NL*
he
must
make
her
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
get
out
until
the
train
stops
again
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
It
*NL*
wo
n't
be
very
long
until
we
reach
another
station
.
You
can
get
out
then
*NL*
if
you
want
to
.
I
wo
n't
stop
you
.
All
I
want
you
to
do
is
to
listen
a
*NL*
moment
.
You
'll
let
me
tell
you
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
seemed
not
to
listen
.
She
only
turned
her
head
toward
the
window
,
*NL*
where
outside
all
was
black
.
The
train
was
speeding
with
steady
grace
*NL*
across
the
fields
and
through
patches
of
wood
.
The
long
whistles
*NL*
came
with
sad
,
musical
effect
as
the
lonely
woodland
crossings
were
*NL*
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
conductor
entered
the
car
and
took
up
the
one
or
two
fares
that
*NL*
had
been
added
at
Chicago
.
He
approached
Hurstwood
,
who
handed
out
the
*NL*
tickets
.
Poised
as
she
was
to
act
,
Carrie
made
no
move
.
She
did
not
look
*NL*
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
conductor
had
gone
again
Hurstwood
felt
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
angry
at
me
because
I
deceived
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
did
n't
mean
*NL*
to
,
Carrie
.
As
I
live
I
did
n't
.
I
could
n't
help
it
.
I
could
n't
stay
away
*NL*
from
you
after
the
first
time
I
saw
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
ignoring
the
last
deception
as
something
that
might
go
by
the
*NL*
board
.
He
wanted
to
convince
her
that
his
wife
could
no
longer
be
a
*NL*
factor
in
their
relationship
.
The
money
he
had
stolen
he
tried
to
shut
*NL*
out
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
to
me
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
I
hate
you
.
I
want
you
to
go
away
from
*NL*
me
.
I
am
going
to
get
out
at
the
very
next
station
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
a
tremble
of
excitement
and
opposition
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
you
'll
hear
me
out
,
wo
n't
you
?
After
all
you
*NL*
have
said
about
loving
me
,
you
might
hear
me
.
I
do
n't
want
to
do
you
any
*NL*
harm
.
I
'll
give
you
the
money
to
go
back
with
when
you
go
.
I
merely
want
*NL*
to
tell
you
,
Carrie
.
You
ca
n't
stop
me
from
loving
you
,
whatever
you
may
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
tenderly
,
but
received
no
reply
.
``
You
think
I
have
*NL*
deceived
you
badly
,
but
I
have
n't
.
I
did
n't
do
it
willingly
.
I
'm
through
*NL*
with
my
wife
.
She
has
n't
any
claims
on
me
.
I
'll
never
see
her
any
more
.
*NL*
That
's
why
I
'm
here
to-night
.
That
's
why
I
came
and
got
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
Charlie
was
hurt
,
''
said
Carrie
,
savagely
.
``
You
deceived
me
.
*NL*
You
've
been
deceiving
me
all
the
time
,
and
now
you
want
to
force
me
to
*NL*
run
away
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
excited
that
she
got
up
and
tried
to
get
by
him
again
.
He
let
*NL*
her
,
and
she
took
another
seat
.
Then
he
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
run
away
from
me
,
Carrie
,
''
he
said
gently
.
``
Let
me
explain
.
If
*NL*
you
will
only
hear
me
out
you
will
see
where
I
stand
.
I
tell
you
my
wife
*NL*
is
nothing
to
me
.
She
has
n't
been
anything
for
years
or
I
would
n't
have
*NL*
ever
come
near
you
.
I
'm
going
to
get
a
divorce
just
as
soon
as
I
can
.
*NL*
I
'll
never
see
her
again
.
I
'm
done
with
all
that
.
You
're
the
only
person
*NL*
I
want
.
If
I
can
have
you
I
wo
n't
ever
think
of
another
woman
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
heard
all
this
in
a
very
ruffled
state
.
It
sounded
sincere
*NL*
enough
,
however
,
despite
all
he
had
done
.
There
was
a
tenseness
in
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
voice
and
manner
which
could
but
have
some
effect
.
She
did
*NL*
not
want
anything
to
do
with
him
.
He
was
married
,
he
had
deceived
*NL*
her
once
,
and
now
again
,
and
she
thought
him
terrible
.
Still
there
is
*NL*
something
in
such
daring
and
power
which
is
fascinating
to
a
woman
,
*NL*
especially
if
she
can
be
made
to
feel
that
it
is
all
prompted
by
love
of
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
progress
of
the
train
was
having
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
*NL*
solution
of
this
difficult
situation
.
The
speeding
wheels
and
*NL*
disappearing
country
put
Chicago
farther
and
farther
behind
.
Carrie
*NL*
could
feel
that
she
was
being
borne
a
long
distance
off
--
that
the
engine
*NL*
was
making
an
almost
through
run
to
some
distant
city
.
She
felt
at
times
*NL*
as
if
she
could
cry
out
and
make
such
a
row
that
some
one
would
come
to
*NL*
her
aid
;
at
other
times
it
seemed
an
almost
useless
thing
--
so
far
was
*NL*
she
from
any
aid
,
no
matter
what
she
did
.
All
the
while
Hurstwood
was
*NL*
endeavouring
to
formulate
his
plea
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
strike
*NL*
home
and
bring
her
into
sympathy
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
simply
put
where
I
did
n't
know
what
else
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
deigned
no
suggestion
of
hearing
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
say
you
would
n't
come
unless
I
could
marry
you
,
I
decided
to
put
*NL*
everything
else
behind
me
and
get
you
to
come
away
with
me
.
I
'm
going
*NL*
off
now
to
another
city
.
I
want
to
go
to
Montreal
for
a
while
,
and
then
*NL*
anywhere
you
want
to
.
We
'll
go
and
live
in
New
York
,
if
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
not
have
anything
to
do
with
you
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
want
to
get
off
*NL*
this
train
.
Where
are
we
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Detroit
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Carrie
,
in
a
burst
of
anguish
.
So
distant
and
definite
a
*NL*
point
seemed
to
increase
the
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
along
with
me
?
''
he
said
,
as
if
there
was
great
danger
*NL*
that
she
would
not
.
``
You
wo
n't
need
to
do
anything
but
travel
with
me
.
*NL*
I
'll
not
trouble
you
in
any
way
.
You
can
see
Montreal
and
New
York
,
and
*NL*
then
if
you
do
n't
want
to
stay
you
can
go
back
.
It
will
be
better
than
*NL*
trying
to
go
back
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
gleam
of
fairness
shone
in
this
proposition
for
Carrie
.
It
*NL*
seemed
a
plausible
thing
to
do
,
much
as
she
feared
his
opposition
if
she
*NL*
tried
to
carry
it
out
.
Montreal
and
New
York
!
Even
now
she
was
speeding
*NL*
toward
those
great
,
strange
lands
,
and
could
see
them
if
she
liked
.
She
*NL*
thought
,
but
made
no
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
thought
he
saw
a
shade
of
compliance
in
this
.
He
redoubled
his
*NL*
ardour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
,
''
he
said
,
``
what
I
've
given
up
.
I
ca
n't
go
back
to
Chicago
any
*NL*
more
.
I
've
got
to
stay
away
and
live
alone
now
,
if
you
do
n't
come
with
*NL*
me
.
You
wo
n't
go
back
on
me
entirely
,
will
you
,
Carrie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
talk
to
me
,
''
she
answered
forcibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
kept
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
felt
the
train
to
be
slowing
down
.
It
was
the
moment
to
act
if
*NL*
she
was
to
act
at
all
.
She
stirred
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
of
going
,
Carrie
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
you
ever
cared
for
me
at
*NL*
all
,
come
along
and
let
's
start
right
.
I
'll
do
whatever
you
say
.
I
'll
*NL*
marry
you
,
or
I
'll
let
you
go
back
.
Give
yourself
time
to
think
it
over
.
*NL*
I
would
n't
have
wanted
you
to
come
if
I
had
n't
loved
you
.
I
tell
you
,
*NL*
Carrie
,
before
God
,
I
ca
n't
live
without
you
.
I
wo
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
tensity
of
fierceness
in
the
man
's
plea
which
appealed
*NL*
deeply
to
her
sympathies
.
It
was
a
dissolving
fire
which
was
actuating
*NL*
him
now
.
He
was
loving
her
too
intensely
to
think
of
giving
her
up
in
*NL*
this
,
his
hour
of
distress
.
He
clutched
her
hand
nervously
and
pressed
*NL*
it
with
all
the
force
of
an
appeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
was
now
all
but
stopped
.
It
was
running
by
some
cars
on
a
side
*NL*
track
.
Everything
outside
was
dark
and
dreary
.
A
few
sprinkles
on
the
*NL*
window
began
to
indicate
that
it
was
raining
.
Carrie
hung
in
a
quandary
,
*NL*
balancing
between
decision
and
helplessness
.
Now
the
train
stopped
,
and
*NL*
she
was
listening
to
his
plea
.
The
engine
backed
a
few
feet
and
all
was
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wavered
,
totally
unable
to
make
a
move
.
Minute
after
minute
slipped
*NL*
by
and
still
she
hesitated
,
he
pleading
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
let
me
come
back
if
I
want
to
?
''
she
asked
,
as
if
she
now
had
*NL*
the
upper
hand
and
her
companion
was
utterly
subdued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
he
answered
,
``
you
know
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
only
listened
as
one
who
has
granted
a
temporary
amnesty
.
She
*NL*
began
to
feel
as
if
the
matter
were
in
her
hands
entirely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
was
again
in
rapid
motion
.
Hurstwood
changed
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
very
tired
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
let
me
get
you
a
berth
in
the
sleeper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
,
though
for
all
her
distress
and
his
trickery
she
was
*NL*
beginning
to
notice
what
she
had
always
felt
--
his
thoughtfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
will
feel
so
much
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
fix
my
coat
for
you
,
anyway
,
''
and
he
arose
and
arranged
his
*NL*
light
coat
in
a
comfortable
position
to
receive
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
he
said
tenderly
,
``
now
see
if
you
ca
n't
rest
a
little
.
''
He
*NL*
could
have
kissed
her
for
her
compliance
.
He
took
his
seat
beside
her
*NL*
and
thought
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
we
're
in
for
a
heavy
rain
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
looks
,
''
said
Carrie
,
whose
nerves
were
quieting
under
the
*NL*
sound
of
the
rain
drops
,
driven
by
a
gusty
wind
,
as
the
train
swept
on
*NL*
frantically
through
the
shadow
to
a
newer
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
that
he
had
in
a
measure
mollified
Carrie
was
a
source
of
*NL*
satisfaction
to
Hurstwood
,
but
it
furnished
only
the
most
temporary
*NL*
relief
.
Now
that
her
opposition
was
out
of
the
way
,
he
had
all
of
his
*NL*
time
to
devote
to
the
consideration
of
his
own
error
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
condition
was
bitter
in
the
extreme
,
for
he
did
not
want
the
*NL*
miserable
sum
he
had
stolen
.
He
did
not
want
to
be
a
thief
.
That
sum
*NL*
or
any
other
could
never
compensate
for
the
state
which
he
had
thus
*NL*
foolishly
doffed
.
It
could
not
give
him
back
his
host
of
friends
,
his
*NL*
name
,
his
house
and
family
,
nor
Carrie
,
as
he
had
meant
to
have
her
.
*NL*
He
was
shut
out
from
Chicago
--
from
his
easy
,
comfortable
state
.
He
*NL*
had
robbed
himself
of
his
dignity
,
his
merry
meetings
,
his
pleasant
*NL*
evenings
.
And
for
what
?
The
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
unbearable
it
*NL*
became
.
He
began
to
think
that
he
would
try
and
restore
himself
to
his
*NL*
old
state
.
He
would
return
the
miserable
thievings
of
the
night
and
*NL*
explain
.
Perhaps
Moy
would
understand
.
Perhaps
they
would
forgive
him
*NL*
and
let
him
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
noontime
the
train
rolled
into
Detroit
and
he
began
to
feel
*NL*
exceedingly
nervous
.
The
police
must
be
on
his
track
by
now
.
They
had
*NL*
probably
notified
all
the
police
of
the
big
cities
,
and
detectives
would
*NL*
be
watching
for
him
.
He
remembered
instances
in
which
defaulters
had
*NL*
been
captured
.
Consequently
,
he
breathed
heavily
and
paled
somewhat
.
His
*NL*
hands
felt
as
if
they
must
have
something
to
do
.
He
simulated
interest
*NL*
in
several
scenes
without
which
he
did
not
feel
.
He
repeatedly
beat
his
*NL*
foot
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
noticed
his
agitation
,
but
said
nothing
.
She
had
no
idea
what
it
*NL*
meant
or
that
it
was
important
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
now
why
he
had
not
asked
whether
this
train
went
on
through
*NL*
to
Montreal
or
some
Canadian
point
.
Perhaps
he
could
have
saved
time
.
He
*NL*
jumped
up
and
sought
the
conductor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
any
part
of
this
train
go
to
Montreal
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
next
sleeper
back
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
have
asked
more
,
but
it
did
not
seem
wise
,
so
he
decided
to
*NL*
inquire
at
the
depot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
rolled
into
the
yards
,
clanging
and
puffing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
we
had
better
go
right
on
through
to
Montreal
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
Carrie
.
``
I
'll
see
what
the
connections
are
when
we
get
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
exceedingly
nervous
,
but
did
his
best
to
put
on
a
calm
exterior
.
*NL*
Carrie
only
looked
at
him
with
large
,
troubled
eyes
.
She
was
drifting
*NL*
mentally
,
unable
to
say
to
herself
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
stopped
and
Hurstwood
led
the
way
out
.
He
looked
warily
around
*NL*
him
,
pretending
to
look
after
Carrie
.
Seeing
nothing
that
indicated
*NL*
studied
observation
,
he
made
his
way
to
the
ticket
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
train
for
Montreal
leaves
when
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
twenty
minutes
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bought
two
tickets
and
Pullman
berths
.
Then
he
hastened
back
to
*NL*
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
go
right
out
again
,
''
he
said
,
scarcely
noticing
that
Carrie
looked
*NL*
tired
and
weary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
was
out
of
all
this
,
''
she
exclaimed
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
feel
better
when
we
reach
Montreal
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
an
earthly
thing
with
me
,
''
said
Carrie
;
``
not
even
a
*NL*
handkerchief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
buy
all
you
want
as
soon
as
you
get
there
,
dearest
,
''
he
*NL*
explained
.
``
You
can
call
in
a
dressmaker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
crier
called
the
train
ready
and
they
got
on
.
Hurstwood
breathed
*NL*
a
sigh
of
relief
as
it
started
.
There
was
a
short
run
to
the
river
,
and
*NL*
there
they
were
ferried
over
.
They
had
barely
pulled
the
train
off
the
*NL*
ferry-boat
when
he
settled
back
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
be
so
very
long
now
,
''
he
said
,
remembering
her
in
his
relief
.
*NL*
``
We
get
there
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
scarcely
deigned
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
see
if
there
is
a
dining-car
,
''
he
added
.
``
I
'm
hungry
.

Chapter
XXIX
.
THE
SOLACE
OF
TRAVEL
--
THE
BOATS
OF
THE
SEA
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
untravelled
,
territory
other
than
their
own
familiar
heath
is
*NL*
invariably
fascinating
.
Next
to
love
,
it
is
the
one
thing
which
solaces
*NL*
and
delights
.
Things
new
are
too
important
to
be
neglected
,
and
mind
,
*NL*
which
is
a
mere
reflection
of
sensory
impressions
,
succumbs
to
the
flood
*NL*
of
objects
.
Thus
lovers
are
forgotten
,
sorrows
laid
aside
,
death
hidden
*NL*
from
view
.
There
is
a
world
of
accumulated
feeling
back
of
the
trite
*NL*
dramatic
expression
--
``
I
am
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Carrie
looked
out
upon
the
flying
scenery
she
almost
forgot
that
she
*NL*
had
been
tricked
into
this
long
journey
against
her
will
and
that
she
*NL*
was
without
the
necessary
apparel
for
travelling
.
She
quite
forgot
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
presence
at
times
,
and
looked
away
to
homely
farmhouses
and
*NL*
cosey
cottages
in
villages
with
wondering
eyes
.
It
was
an
interesting
*NL*
world
to
her
.
Her
life
had
just
begun
.
She
did
not
feel
herself
defeated
*NL*
at
all
.
Neither
was
she
blasted
in
hope
.
The
great
city
held
much
.
*NL*
Possibly
she
would
come
out
of
bondage
into
freedom
--
who
knows
?
Perhaps
*NL*
she
would
be
happy
.
These
thoughts
raised
her
above
the
level
of
erring
.
*NL*
She
was
saved
in
that
she
was
hopeful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
the
train
pulled
safely
into
Montreal
and
they
*NL*
stepped
down
,
Hurstwood
glad
to
be
out
of
danger
,
Carrie
wondering
at
*NL*
the
novel
atmosphere
of
the
northern
city
.
Long
before
,
Hurstwood
had
*NL*
been
here
,
and
now
he
remembered
the
name
of
the
hotel
at
which
he
had
*NL*
stopped
.
As
they
came
out
of
the
main
entrance
of
the
depot
he
heard
it
*NL*
called
anew
by
a
busman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
right
up
and
get
rooms
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
clerk
's
office
Hurstwood
swung
the
register
about
while
the
clerk
*NL*
came
forward
.
He
was
thinking
what
name
he
would
put
down
.
With
the
*NL*
latter
before
him
he
found
no
time
for
hesitation
.
A
name
he
had
seen
*NL*
out
of
the
car
window
came
swiftly
to
him
.
It
was
pleasing
enough
.
With
*NL*
an
easy
hand
he
wrote
,
``
G.
W.
Murdock
and
wife
.
''
It
was
the
largest
*NL*
concession
to
necessity
he
felt
like
making
.
His
initials
he
could
not
*NL*
spare
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
shown
their
room
Carrie
saw
at
once
that
he
had
secured
*NL*
her
a
lovely
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
bath
there
,
''
said
he
.
``
Now
you
can
clean
up
when
you
get
*NL*
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
went
over
and
looked
out
the
window
,
while
Hurstwood
looked
at
*NL*
himself
in
the
glass
.
He
felt
dusty
and
unclean
.
He
had
no
trunk
,
no
*NL*
change
of
linen
,
not
even
a
hair-brush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
ring
for
soap
and
towels
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
send
you
up
a
hair-brush
.
*NL*
Then
you
can
bathe
and
get
ready
for
breakfast
.
I
'll
go
for
a
shave
and
*NL*
come
back
and
get
you
,
and
then
we
'll
go
out
and
look
for
some
clothes
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
good-naturedly
as
he
said
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
in
one
of
the
rocking-chairs
,
while
Hurstwood
waited
for
*NL*
the
boy
,
who
soon
knocked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soap
,
towels
,
and
a
pitcher
of
ice-water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
now
,
''
he
said
to
Carrie
,
coming
toward
her
and
holding
out
his
*NL*
hands
,
but
she
did
not
move
to
take
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
mad
at
me
,
are
you
?
''
he
asked
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
she
answered
,
rather
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
care
for
me
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
answer
,
but
looked
steadily
toward
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
you
could
love
me
a
little
?
''
he
pleaded
,
taking
one
of
*NL*
her
hands
,
which
she
endeavoured
to
draw
away
.
``
You
once
said
you
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made
you
deceive
me
so
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
help
it
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
wanted
you
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
have
any
right
to
want
me
,
''
she
answered
,
striking
cleanly
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
Carrie
,
''
he
answered
,
``
here
I
am
.
It
's
too
late
now
.
Wo
n't
*NL*
you
try
and
care
for
me
a
little
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
rather
worsted
in
thought
as
he
stood
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
negatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
start
all
over
again
.
Be
my
wife
from
to-day
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
rose
up
as
if
to
step
away
,
he
holding
her
hand
.
Now
he
slipped
*NL*
his
arm
about
her
and
she
struggled
,
but
in
vain
.
He
held
her
quite
*NL*
close
.
Instantly
there
flamed
up
in
his
body
the
all
compelling
desire
.
*NL*
His
affection
took
an
ardent
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
was
folded
close
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
love
me
?
''
he
said
.
``
Wo
n't
you
be
mine
from
now
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
never
been
ill-disposed
toward
him
.
Only
a
moment
before
she
*NL*
had
been
listening
with
some
complacency
,
remembering
her
old
affection
*NL*
for
him
.
He
was
so
handsome
,
so
daring
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
however
,
this
feeling
had
changed
to
one
of
opposition
,
which
rose
*NL*
feebly
.
It
mastered
her
for
a
moment
,
and
then
,
held
close
as
she
was
,
*NL*
began
to
wane
.
Something
else
in
her
spoke
.
This
man
,
to
whose
bosom
she
*NL*
was
being
pressed
,
was
strong
;
he
was
passionate
,
he
loved
her
,
and
she
*NL*
was
alone
.
If
she
did
not
turn
to
him
--
accept
of
his
love
--
where
else
*NL*
might
she
go
?
Her
resistance
half
dissolved
in
the
flood
of
his
strong
*NL*
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
him
lifting
her
head
and
looking
into
her
eyes
.
What
magnetism
*NL*
there
was
she
could
never
know
.
His
many
sins
,
however
,
were
for
the
*NL*
moment
all
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
her
closer
and
kissed
her
,
and
she
felt
that
further
*NL*
opposition
was
useless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
marry
me
?
''
she
asked
,
forgetting
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
very
day
,
''
he
said
,
with
all
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
hall-boy
pounded
on
the
door
and
he
released
his
hold
upon
her
*NL*
regretfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
get
ready
now
,
will
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
at
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
back
in
three-quarters
of
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
,
flushed
and
excited
,
moved
away
as
he
admitted
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Below
stairs
,
he
halted
in
the
lobby
to
look
for
a
barber
shop
.
For
the
*NL*
moment
,
he
was
in
fine
feather
.
His
recent
victory
over
Carrie
seemed
*NL*
to
atone
for
much
he
had
endured
during
the
last
few
days
.
Life
seemed
*NL*
worth
fighting
for
.
This
eastward
flight
from
all
things
customary
and
*NL*
attached
seemed
as
if
it
might
have
happiness
in
store
.
The
storm
showed
*NL*
a
rainbow
at
the
end
of
which
might
be
a
pot
of
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
about
to
cross
to
a
little
red-and-white
striped
bar
which
was
*NL*
fastened
up
beside
a
door
when
a
voice
greeted
him
familiarly
.
Instantly
*NL*
his
heart
sank
.
``
Why
,
hello
,
George
,
old
man
!
''
said
the
voice
.
``
What
are
*NL*
you
doing
down
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
already
confronted
,
and
recognised
his
friend
Kenny
,
the
*NL*
stock-broker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
attending
to
a
little
private
matter
,
''
he
answered
,
his
mind
*NL*
working
like
a
key-board
of
a
telephone
station
.
This
man
evidently
did
*NL*
not
know
--
he
had
not
read
the
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
seems
strange
to
see
you
way
up
here
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenny
*NL*
genially
.
``
Stopping
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hurstwood
uneasily
,
thinking
of
his
handwriting
on
the
*NL*
register
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
to
be
in
town
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
only
a
day
or
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
Had
your
breakfast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
lying
blandly
.
``
I
'm
just
going
for
a
shave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
have
a
drink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
until
afterwards
,
''
said
the
ex-manager
.
``
I
'll
see
you
later
.
Are
*NL*
you
stopping
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mr.
Kenny
,
and
then
,
turning
the
word
again
added
:
``
How
are
*NL*
things
out
in
Chicago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
the
same
as
usual
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
smiling
genially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wife
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
see
more
of
you
to-day
.
I
'm
just
going
in
here
for
*NL*
breakfast
.
Come
in
when
you
're
through
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
moving
away
.
The
whole
conversation
was
a
*NL*
trial
to
him
.
It
seemed
to
add
complications
with
very
word
.
This
man
*NL*
called
up
a
thousand
memories
.
He
represented
everything
he
had
left
.
*NL*
Chicago
,
his
wife
,
the
elegant
resort
--
all
these
were
in
his
greeting
*NL*
and
inquiries
.
And
here
he
was
in
this
same
hotel
expecting
to
confer
*NL*
with
him
,
unquestionably
waiting
to
have
a
good
time
with
him
.
All
*NL*
at
once
the
Chicago
papers
would
arrive
.
The
local
papers
would
have
*NL*
accounts
in
them
this
very
day
.
He
forgot
his
triumph
with
Carrie
in
the
*NL*
possibility
of
soon
being
known
for
what
he
was
,
in
this
man
's
eyes
,
a
*NL*
safe-breaker
.
He
could
have
groaned
as
he
went
into
the
barber
shop
.
He
*NL*
decided
to
escape
and
seek
a
more
secluded
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
when
he
came
out
he
was
glad
to
see
the
lobby
clear
,
*NL*
and
hastened
toward
the
stairs
.
He
would
get
Carrie
and
go
out
by
the
*NL*
ladies
'
entrance
.
They
would
have
breakfast
in
some
more
inconspicuous
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Across
the
lobby
,
however
,
another
individual
was
surveying
him
.
He
was
*NL*
of
a
commonplace
Irish
type
,
small
of
stature
,
cheaply
dressed
,
and
with
*NL*
a
head
that
seemed
a
smaller
edition
of
some
huge
ward
politician
's
.
*NL*
This
individual
had
been
evidently
talking
with
the
clerk
,
but
now
he
*NL*
surveyed
the
ex-manager
keenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
felt
the
long-range
examination
and
recognised
the
type
.
*NL*
Instinctively
he
felt
that
the
man
was
a
detective
--
that
he
was
being
*NL*
watched
.
He
hurried
across
,
pretending
not
to
notice
,
but
in
his
mind
*NL*
was
a
world
of
thoughts
.
What
would
happen
now
?
What
could
these
people
*NL*
do
?
He
began
to
trouble
concerning
the
extradition
laws
.
He
did
not
*NL*
understand
them
absolutely
.
Perhaps
he
could
be
arrested
.
Oh
,
if
Carrie
*NL*
should
find
out
!
Montreal
was
too
warm
for
him
.
He
began
to
long
to
be
*NL*
out
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
bathed
and
was
waiting
when
he
arrived
.
She
looked
*NL*
refreshed
--
more
delightful
than
ever
,
but
reserved
.
Since
he
had
gone
*NL*
she
had
resumed
somewhat
of
her
cold
attitude
towards
him
.
Love
was
not
*NL*
blazing
in
her
heart
.
He
felt
it
,
and
his
troubles
seemed
increased
.
He
*NL*
could
not
take
her
in
his
arms
;
he
did
not
even
try
.
Something
about
her
*NL*
forbade
it
.
In
part
his
opinion
was
the
result
of
his
own
experiences
*NL*
and
reflections
below
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
ready
,
are
you
?
''
he
said
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
out
for
breakfast
.
This
place
down
here
does
n't
appeal
to
me
*NL*
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
out
,
and
at
the
corner
the
commonplace
Irish
individual
was
*NL*
standing
,
eyeing
him
.
Hurstwood
could
scarcely
refrain
from
showing
that
*NL*
he
knew
of
this
chap
's
presence
.
The
insolence
in
the
fellow
's
eye
was
*NL*
galling
.
Still
they
passed
,
and
he
explained
to
Carrie
concerning
the
*NL*
city
.
Another
restaurant
was
not
long
in
showing
itself
,
and
here
they
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
queer
town
this
is
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
marvelled
at
it
solely
*NL*
because
it
was
not
like
Chicago
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
Is
n't
as
lively
as
Chicago
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
Do
n't
you
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Carrie
,
whose
feelings
were
already
localised
in
the
great
*NL*
Western
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
n't
as
interesting
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
here
?
''
asked
Carrie
,
wondering
at
his
choosing
to
visit
this
*NL*
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
much
,
''
returned
Hurstwood
.
``
It
's
quite
a
resort
.
There
's
some
*NL*
pretty
scenery
about
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
listened
,
but
with
a
feeling
of
unrest
.
There
was
much
about
her
*NL*
situation
which
destroyed
the
possibility
of
appreciation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
wo
n't
stay
here
long
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
who
was
now
really
glad
*NL*
to
note
her
dissatisfaction
.
``
You
pick
out
your
clothes
as
soon
as
*NL*
breakfast
is
over
and
we
'll
run
down
to
New
York
soon
.
You
'll
like
that
.
*NL*
It
's
a
lot
more
like
a
city
than
any
place
outside
Chicago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
really
planning
to
slip
out
and
away
.
He
would
see
what
these
*NL*
detectives
would
do
--
what
move
his
employers
at
Chicago
would
make
--
then
*NL*
he
would
slip
away
--
down
to
New
York
,
where
it
was
easy
to
hide
.
He
knew
*NL*
enough
about
that
city
to
know
that
its
mysteries
and
possibilities
of
*NL*
mystification
were
infinite
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
he
thought
,
however
,
the
more
wretched
his
situation
became
.
*NL*
He
saw
that
getting
here
did
not
exactly
clear
up
the
ground
.
The
firm
*NL*
would
probably
employ
detectives
to
watch
him
--
Pinkerton
men
or
agents
*NL*
of
Mooney
and
Boland
.
They
might
arrest
him
the
moment
he
tried
to
leave
*NL*
Canada
.
So
he
might
be
compelled
to
remain
here
months
,
and
in
what
a
*NL*
state
!
*NL*
*NL*
Back
at
the
hotel
Hurstwood
was
anxious
and
yet
fearful
to
see
the
*NL*
morning
papers
.
He
wanted
to
know
how
far
the
news
of
his
criminal
deed
*NL*
had
spread
.
So
he
told
Carrie
he
would
be
up
in
a
few
moments
,
and
went
*NL*
to
secure
and
scan
the
dailies
.
No
familiar
or
suspicious
faces
were
*NL*
about
,
and
yet
he
did
not
like
reading
in
the
lobby
,
so
he
sought
the
*NL*
main
parlour
on
the
floor
above
and
,
seated
by
a
window
there
,
looked
*NL*
them
over
.
Very
little
was
given
to
his
crime
,
but
it
was
there
,
*NL*
several
``
sticks
''
in
all
,
among
all
the
riffraff
of
telegraphed
murders
,
*NL*
accidents
,
marriages
,
and
other
news
.
He
wished
,
half
sadly
,
that
he
*NL*
could
undo
it
all
.
Every
moment
of
his
time
in
this
far-off
abode
of
*NL*
safety
but
added
to
his
feeling
that
he
had
made
a
great
mistake
.
There
*NL*
could
have
been
an
easier
way
out
if
he
had
only
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
papers
before
going
to
the
room
,
thinking
thus
to
keep
them
*NL*
out
of
the
hands
of
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
are
you
feeling
?
''
he
asked
of
her
.
She
was
engaged
in
looking
*NL*
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
over
,
and
was
about
to
begin
a
conversation
with
her
,
when
a
*NL*
knock
came
at
their
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
it
's
one
of
my
parcels
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
opened
the
door
,
outside
of
which
stood
the
individual
whom
he
*NL*
had
so
thoroughly
suspected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
Mr.
Hurstwood
,
are
you
?
''
said
the
latter
,
with
a
volume
of
*NL*
affected
shrewdness
and
assurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hurstwood
calmly
.
He
knew
the
type
so
thoroughly
that
some
*NL*
of
his
old
familiar
indifference
to
it
returned
.
Such
men
as
these
were
*NL*
of
the
lowest
stratum
welcomed
at
the
resort
.
He
stepped
out
and
closed
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
what
I
am
here
for
,
do
n't
you
?
''
said
the
man
*NL*
confidentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
guess
,
''
said
Hurstwood
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
you
intend
to
try
and
keep
the
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
my
affair
,
''
said
Hurstwood
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
do
it
,
you
know
,
''
said
the
detective
,
eyeing
him
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
my
man
,
''
said
Hurstwood
authoritatively
,
``
you
do
n't
*NL*
understand
anything
about
this
case
,
and
I
ca
n't
explain
to
you
.
*NL*
Whatever
I
intend
to
do
I
'll
do
without
advice
from
the
outside
.
You
'll
*NL*
have
to
excuse
me
.
''
``
Well
,
now
,
there
's
no
use
of
your
talking
that
*NL*
way
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
when
you
're
in
the
hands
of
the
police
.
We
can
make
*NL*
a
lot
of
trouble
for
you
if
we
want
to
.
You
're
not
registered
right
in
*NL*
this
house
,
you
have
n't
got
your
wife
with
you
,
and
the
newspapers
do
n't
*NL*
know
you
're
here
yet
.
You
might
as
well
be
reasonable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
to
know
?
''
asked
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
you
're
going
to
send
back
that
money
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
paused
and
studied
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
use
explaining
to
you
about
this
,
''
he
said
at
last
.
``
There
's
*NL*
no
use
of
your
asking
me
.
I
'm
no
fool
,
you
know
.
I
know
just
what
you
*NL*
can
do
and
what
you
ca
n't
.
You
can
create
a
lot
of
trouble
if
you
want
*NL*
to
.
I
know
that
all
right
,
but
it
wo
n't
help
you
to
get
the
money
.
Now
,
*NL*
I
've
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
.
I
've
already
written
Fitzgerald
and
*NL*
Moy
,
so
there
's
nothing
I
can
say
.
You
wait
until
you
hear
more
from
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
he
had
been
talking
he
had
been
moving
away
from
the
door
,
*NL*
down
the
corridor
,
out
of
the
hearing
of
Carrie
.
They
were
now
near
the
*NL*
end
where
the
corridor
opened
into
the
large
general
parlour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
give
it
up
?
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
irritated
Hurstwood
greatly
.
Hot
blood
poured
into
his
brain
.
*NL*
Many
thoughts
formulated
themselves
.
He
was
no
thief
.
He
did
n't
want
the
*NL*
money
.
If
he
could
only
explain
to
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
,
maybe
it
would
be
*NL*
all
right
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
,
''
he
said
,
``
there
's
no
use
my
talking
about
this
at
all
.
I
*NL*
respect
your
power
all
right
,
but
I
'll
have
to
deal
with
the
people
who
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
ca
n't
get
out
of
Canada
with
it
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
get
out
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
When
I
get
ready
there
'll
be
*NL*
nothing
to
stop
me
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
back
,
and
the
detective
watched
him
closely
.
It
seemed
an
*NL*
intolerable
thing
.
Still
he
went
on
and
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
it
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
friend
of
mine
from
Chicago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
this
conversation
was
such
a
shock
that
,
coming
as
it
did
*NL*
after
all
the
other
worry
of
the
past
week
,
it
sufficed
to
induce
a
deep
*NL*
gloom
and
moral
revulsion
in
Hurstwood
.
What
hurt
him
most
was
the
fact
*NL*
that
he
was
being
pursued
as
a
thief
.
He
began
to
see
the
nature
of
that
*NL*
social
injustice
which
sees
but
one
side
--
often
but
a
single
point
in
*NL*
a
long
tragedy
.
All
the
newspapers
noted
but
one
thing
,
his
taking
the
*NL*
money
.
How
and
wherefore
were
but
indifferently
dealt
with
.
All
the
*NL*
complications
which
led
up
to
it
were
unknown
.
He
was
accused
without
*NL*
being
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
in
his
room
with
Carrie
the
same
day
,
he
decided
to
send
the
*NL*
money
back
.
He
would
write
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
,
explain
all
,
and
then
*NL*
send
it
by
express
.
Maybe
they
would
forgive
him
.
Perhaps
they
would
*NL*
ask
him
back
.
He
would
make
good
the
false
statement
he
had
made
about
*NL*
writing
them
.
Then
he
would
leave
this
peculiar
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
hour
he
thought
over
this
plausible
statement
of
the
tangle
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
tell
them
about
his
wife
,
but
could
n't
.
He
finally
narrowed
it
*NL*
down
to
an
assertion
that
he
was
light-headed
from
entertaining
friends
,
*NL*
had
found
the
safe
open
,
and
having
gone
so
far
as
to
take
the
money
*NL*
out
,
had
accidentally
closed
it
.
This
act
he
regretted
very
much
.
He
was
*NL*
sorry
he
had
put
them
to
so
much
trouble
.
He
would
undo
what
he
could
by
*NL*
sending
the
money
back
--
the
major
portion
of
it
.
The
remainder
he
would
*NL*
pay
up
as
soon
as
he
could
.
Was
there
any
possibility
of
his
being
*NL*
restored
?
This
he
only
hinted
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
troubled
state
of
the
man
's
mind
may
be
judged
by
the
very
*NL*
construction
of
this
letter
.
For
the
nonce
he
forgot
what
a
painful
*NL*
thing
it
would
be
to
resume
his
old
place
,
even
if
it
were
given
him
.
He
*NL*
forgot
that
he
had
severed
himself
from
the
past
as
by
a
sword
,
and
that
*NL*
if
he
did
manage
to
in
some
way
reunite
himself
with
it
,
the
jagged
line
*NL*
of
separation
and
reunion
would
always
show
.
He
was
always
forgetting
*NL*
something
--
his
wife
,
Carrie
,
his
need
of
money
,
present
situation
,
or
*NL*
something
--
and
so
did
not
reason
clearly
.
Nevertheless
,
he
sent
the
*NL*
letter
,
waiting
a
reply
before
sending
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
he
accepted
his
present
situation
with
Carrie
,
getting
what
*NL*
joy
out
of
it
he
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
came
the
sun
by
noon
,
and
poured
a
golden
flood
through
their
open
*NL*
windows
.
Sparrows
were
twittering
.
There
were
laughter
and
song
in
the
*NL*
air
.
Hurstwood
could
not
keep
his
eyes
from
Carrie
.
She
seemed
the
*NL*
one
ray
of
sunshine
in
all
his
trouble
.
Oh
,
if
she
would
only
love
him
*NL*
wholly
--
only
throw
her
arms
around
him
in
the
blissful
spirit
in
which
*NL*
he
had
seen
her
in
the
little
park
in
Chicago
--
how
happy
he
would
be
!
*NL*
It
would
repay
him
;
it
would
show
him
that
he
had
not
lost
all
.
He
would
*NL*
not
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
,
''
he
said
,
getting
up
once
and
coming
over
to
her
,
``
are
you
*NL*
going
to
stay
with
me
from
now
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
quizzically
,
but
melted
with
sympathy
as
the
value
of
*NL*
the
look
upon
his
face
forced
itself
upon
her
.
It
was
love
now
,
keen
*NL*
and
strong
--
love
enhanced
by
difficulty
and
worry
.
She
could
not
help
*NL*
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
be
everything
to
you
from
now
on
,
''
he
said
.
``
Do
n't
make
me
worry
*NL*
any
more
.
I
'll
be
true
to
you
.
We
'll
go
to
New
York
and
get
a
nice
flat
.
*NL*
I
'll
go
into
business
again
,
and
we
'll
be
happy
.
Wo
n't
you
be
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
listened
quite
solemnly
.
There
was
no
great
passion
in
her
,
but
*NL*
the
drift
of
things
and
this
man
's
proximity
created
a
semblance
of
*NL*
affection
.
She
felt
rather
sorry
for
him
--
a
sorrow
born
of
what
had
only
*NL*
recently
been
a
great
admiration
.
True
love
she
had
never
felt
for
him
.
*NL*
She
would
have
known
as
much
if
she
could
have
analysed
her
feelings
,
*NL*
but
this
thing
which
she
now
felt
aroused
by
his
great
feeling
broke
*NL*
down
the
barriers
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
stay
with
me
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
nodding
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gathered
her
to
himself
,
imprinting
kisses
upon
her
lips
and
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
marry
me
,
though
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'll
get
a
license
to-day
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
a
new
name
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
'll
take
a
new
name
and
live
a
new
*NL*
life
.
From
now
on
I
'm
Murdock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
take
that
name
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
shall
I
take
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
anything
,
only
do
n't
take
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
a
while
,
still
keeping
his
arms
about
her
,
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
would
Wheeler
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
Wheeler
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
get
the
license
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
married
by
a
Baptist
minister
,
the
first
divine
they
found
*NL*
convenient
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
Chicago
firm
answered
.
It
was
by
Mr.
Moy
's
dictation
.
He
*NL*
was
astonished
that
Hurstwood
had
done
this
;
very
sorry
that
it
had
come
*NL*
about
as
it
had
.
If
the
money
were
returned
,
they
would
not
trouble
*NL*
to
prosecute
him
,
as
they
really
bore
him
no
ill-will
.
As
for
his
*NL*
returning
,
or
their
restoring
him
to
his
former
position
,
they
had
not
*NL*
quite
decided
what
the
effect
of
it
would
be
.
They
would
think
it
over
*NL*
and
correspond
with
him
later
,
possibly
,
after
a
little
time
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sum
and
substance
of
it
was
that
there
was
no
hope
,
and
they
wanted
*NL*
the
money
with
the
least
trouble
possible
.
Hurstwood
read
his
doom
.
*NL*
He
decided
to
pay
$
9,500
to
the
agent
whom
they
said
they
would
send
,
*NL*
keeping
$
1,300
for
his
own
use
.
He
telegraphed
his
acquiescence
,
*NL*
explained
to
the
representative
who
called
at
the
hotel
the
same
day
,
*NL*
took
a
certificate
of
payment
,
and
told
Carrie
to
pack
her
trunk
.
He
was
*NL*
slightly
depressed
over
this
newest
move
at
the
time
he
began
to
make
*NL*
it
,
but
eventually
restored
himself
.
He
feared
that
even
yet
he
might
be
*NL*
seized
and
taken
back
,
so
he
tried
to
conceal
his
movements
,
but
it
was
*NL*
scarcely
possible
.
He
ordered
Carrie
's
trunk
sent
to
the
depot
,
where
he
*NL*
had
it
sent
by
express
to
New
York
.
No
one
seemed
to
be
observing
him
,
*NL*
but
he
left
at
night
.
He
was
greatly
agitated
lest
at
the
first
station
*NL*
across
the
border
or
at
the
depot
in
New
York
there
should
be
waiting
*NL*
for
him
an
officer
of
the
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
,
ignorant
of
his
theft
and
his
fears
,
enjoyed
the
entry
into
*NL*
the
latter
city
in
the
morning
.
The
round
green
hills
sentinelling
the
*NL*
broad
,
expansive
bosom
of
the
Hudson
held
her
attention
by
their
beauty
*NL*
as
the
train
followed
the
line
of
the
stream
.
She
had
heard
of
the
*NL*
Hudson
River
,
the
great
city
of
New
York
,
and
now
she
looked
out
,
*NL*
filling
her
mind
with
the
wonder
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
train
turned
east
at
Spuyten
Duyvil
and
followed
the
east
bank
of
*NL*
the
Harlem
River
,
Hurstwood
nervously
called
her
attention
to
the
*NL*
fact
that
they
were
on
the
edge
of
the
city
.
After
her
experience
with
*NL*
Chicago
,
she
expected
long
lines
of
cars
--
a
great
highway
of
tracks
--
and
*NL*
noted
the
difference
.
The
sight
of
a
few
boats
in
the
Harlem
and
more
*NL*
in
the
East
River
tickled
her
young
heart
.
It
was
the
first
sign
of
the
*NL*
great
sea
.
Next
came
a
plain
street
with
five-story
brick
flats
,
and
*NL*
then
the
train
plunged
into
the
tunnel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grand
Central
Station
!
''
called
the
trainman
,
as
,
after
a
few
minutes
of
*NL*
darkness
and
smoke
,
daylight
reappeared
.
Hurstwood
arose
and
gathered
up
*NL*
his
small
grip
.
He
was
screwed
up
to
the
highest
tension
.
With
Carrie
*NL*
he
waited
at
the
door
and
then
dismounted
.
No
one
approached
him
,
but
*NL*
he
glanced
furtively
to
and
fro
as
he
made
for
the
street
entrance
.
*NL*
So
excited
was
he
that
he
forgot
all
about
Carrie
,
who
fell
behind
,
*NL*
wondering
at
his
self-absorption
.
As
he
passed
through
the
depot
proper
*NL*
the
strain
reached
its
climax
and
began
to
wane
.
All
at
once
he
was
on
*NL*
the
sidewalk
,
and
none
but
cabmen
hailed
him
.
He
heaved
a
great
breath
*NL*
and
turned
,
remembering
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
going
to
run
off
and
leave
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
trying
to
remember
which
car
takes
us
to
the
Gilsey
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
hardly
heard
him
,
so
interested
was
she
in
the
busy
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
large
is
New
York
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
a
million
or
more
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
around
and
hailed
a
cab
,
but
he
did
so
in
a
changed
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
years
the
thought
that
he
must
count
these
little
*NL*
expenses
flashed
through
his
mind
.
It
was
a
disagreeable
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
decided
he
would
lose
no
time
living
in
hotels
but
would
rent
a
flat
.
*NL*
Accordingly
he
told
Carrie
,
and
she
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
look
to-day
,
if
you
want
to
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
thought
of
his
experience
in
Montreal
.
At
the
more
important
*NL*
hotels
he
would
be
certain
to
meet
Chicagoans
whom
he
knew
.
He
stood
up
*NL*
and
spoke
to
the
driver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
me
to
the
Belford
,
''
he
said
,
knowing
it
to
be
less
frequented
by
*NL*
those
whom
he
knew
.
Then
he
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
residence
part
?
''
asked
Carrie
,
who
did
not
take
the
tall
*NL*
five-story
walls
on
either
hand
to
be
the
abodes
of
families
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everywhere
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
who
knew
the
city
fairly
well
.
``
There
are
*NL*
no
lawns
in
New
York
.
All
these
are
houses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
I
do
n't
like
it
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
was
coming
to
have
a
few
*NL*
opinions
of
her
own
.

Chapter
XXX
.
THE
KINGDOM
OF
GREATNESS
--
THE
PILGRIM
A
DREAM
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
a
man
like
Hurstwood
could
be
in
Chicago
,
it
is
very
evident
*NL*
that
he
would
be
but
an
inconspicuous
drop
in
an
ocean
like
New
York
.
In
*NL*
Chicago
,
whose
population
still
ranged
about
500,000
,
millionaires
were
*NL*
not
numerous
.
The
rich
had
not
become
so
conspicuously
rich
as
to
drown
*NL*
all
moderate
incomes
in
obscurity
.
The
attention
of
the
inhabitants
*NL*
was
not
so
distracted
by
local
celebrities
in
the
dramatic
,
artistic
,
*NL*
social
,
and
religious
fields
as
to
shut
the
well-positioned
man
from
*NL*
view
.
In
Chicago
the
two
roads
to
distinction
were
politics
and
trade
.
*NL*
In
New
York
the
roads
were
any
one
of
a
half-hundred
,
and
each
had
been
*NL*
diligently
pursued
by
hundreds
,
so
that
celebrities
were
numerous
.
*NL*
The
sea
was
already
full
of
whales
.
A
common
fish
must
needs
disappear
*NL*
wholly
from
view
--
remain
unseen
.
In
other
words
,
Hurstwood
was
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
more
subtle
result
of
such
a
situation
as
this
,
which
,
though
*NL*
not
always
taken
into
account
,
produces
the
tragedies
of
the
world
.
*NL*
The
great
create
an
atmosphere
which
reacts
badly
upon
the
small
.
*NL*
This
atmosphere
is
easily
and
quickly
felt
.
Walk
among
the
magnificent
*NL*
residences
,
the
splendid
equipages
,
the
gilded
shops
,
restaurants
,
*NL*
resorts
of
all
kinds
;
scent
the
flowers
,
the
silks
,
the
wines
;
drink
*NL*
of
the
laughter
springing
from
the
soul
of
luxurious
content
,
of
the
*NL*
glances
which
gleam
like
light
from
defiant
spears
;
feel
the
quality
*NL*
of
the
smiles
which
cut
like
glistening
swords
and
of
strides
born
of
*NL*
place
,
and
you
shall
know
of
what
is
the
atmosphere
of
the
high
*NL*
and
mighty
.
Little
use
to
argue
that
of
such
is
not
the
kingdom
of
*NL*
greatness
,
but
so
long
as
the
world
is
attracted
by
this
and
the
human
*NL*
heart
views
this
as
the
one
desirable
realm
which
it
must
attain
,
so
*NL*
long
,
to
that
heart
,
will
this
remain
the
realm
of
greatness
.
So
long
,
*NL*
also
,
will
the
atmosphere
of
this
realm
work
its
desperate
results
in
*NL*
the
soul
of
man
.
It
is
like
a
chemical
reagent
.
One
day
of
it
,
like
one
*NL*
drop
of
the
other
,
will
so
affect
and
discolour
the
views
,
the
aims
,
the
*NL*
desire
of
the
mind
,
that
it
will
thereafter
remain
forever
dyed
.
A
day
*NL*
of
it
to
the
untried
mind
is
like
opium
to
the
untried
body
.
A
craving
*NL*
is
set
up
which
,
if
gratified
,
shall
eternally
result
in
dreams
and
*NL*
death
.
Aye
!
dreams
unfulfilled
--
gnawing
,
luring
,
idle
phantoms
which
*NL*
beckon
and
lead
,
beckon
and
lead
,
until
death
and
dissolution
dissolve
*NL*
their
power
and
restore
us
blind
to
nature
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
of
Hurstwood
's
age
and
temperament
is
not
subject
to
the
illusions
*NL*
and
burning
desires
of
youth
,
but
neither
has
he
the
strength
of
hope
*NL*
which
gushes
as
a
fountain
in
the
heart
of
youth
.
Such
an
atmosphere
*NL*
could
not
incite
in
him
the
cravings
of
a
boy
of
eighteen
,
but
in
so
far
*NL*
as
they
were
excited
,
the
lack
of
hope
made
them
proportionately
bitter
.
*NL*
He
could
not
fail
to
notice
the
signs
of
affluence
and
luxury
on
every
*NL*
hand
.
He
had
been
to
New
York
before
and
knew
the
resources
of
its
*NL*
folly
.
In
part
it
was
an
awesome
place
to
him
,
for
here
gathered
all
*NL*
that
he
most
respected
on
this
earth
--
wealth
,
place
,
and
fame
.
The
*NL*
majority
of
the
celebrities
with
whom
he
had
tipped
glasses
in
his
day
*NL*
as
manager
hailed
from
this
self-centred
and
populous
spot
.
The
most
*NL*
inviting
stories
of
pleasure
and
luxury
had
been
told
of
places
and
*NL*
individuals
here
.
He
knew
it
to
be
true
that
unconsciously
he
was
*NL*
brushing
elbows
with
fortune
the
livelong
day
;
that
a
hundred
or
*NL*
five
hundred
thousand
gave
no
one
the
privilege
of
living
more
than
*NL*
comfortably
in
so
wealthy
a
place
.
Fashion
and
pomp
required
more
ample
*NL*
sums
,
so
that
the
poor
man
was
nowhere
.
All
this
he
realised
,
now
quite
*NL*
sharply
,
as
he
faced
the
city
,
cut
off
from
his
friends
,
despoiled
of
*NL*
his
modest
fortune
,
and
even
his
name
,
and
forced
to
begin
the
battle
*NL*
for
place
and
comfort
all
over
again
.
He
was
not
old
,
but
he
was
not
so
*NL*
dull
but
that
he
could
feel
he
soon
would
be
.
Of
a
sudden
,
then
,
this
*NL*
show
of
fine
clothes
,
place
,
and
power
took
on
peculiar
significance
.
It
*NL*
was
emphasised
by
contrast
with
his
own
distressing
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
distressing
.
He
soon
found
that
freedom
from
fear
of
arrest
*NL*
was
not
the
sine
qua
non
of
his
existence
.
That
danger
dissolved
,
the
*NL*
next
necessity
became
the
grievous
thing
.
The
paltry
sum
of
thirteen
*NL*
hundred
and
some
odd
dollars
set
against
the
need
of
rent
,
clothing
,
*NL*
food
,
and
pleasure
for
years
to
come
was
a
spectacle
little
calculated
*NL*
to
induce
peace
of
mind
in
one
who
had
been
accustomed
to
spend
five
*NL*
times
that
sum
in
the
course
of
a
year
.
He
thought
upon
the
subject
*NL*
rather
actively
the
first
few
days
he
was
in
New
York
,
and
decided
*NL*
that
he
must
act
quickly
.
As
a
consequence
,
he
consulted
the
business
*NL*
opportunities
advertised
in
the
morning
papers
and
began
investigations
*NL*
on
his
own
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
not
before
he
had
become
settled
,
however
.
Carrie
and
he
went
*NL*
looking
for
a
flat
,
as
arranged
,
and
found
one
in
Seventy-eighth
Street
*NL*
near
Amsterdam
Avenue
.
It
was
a
five-story
building
,
and
their
flat
was
*NL*
on
the
third
floor
.
Owing
to
the
fact
that
the
street
was
not
yet
built
*NL*
up
solidly
,
it
was
possible
to
see
east
to
the
green
tops
of
the
trees
*NL*
in
Central
Park
and
west
to
the
broad
waters
of
the
Hudson
,
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
which
was
to
be
had
out
of
the
west
windows
.
For
the
privilege
of
six
*NL*
rooms
and
a
bath
,
running
in
a
straight
line
,
they
were
compelled
to
pay
*NL*
thirty-five
dollars
a
month
--
an
average
,
and
yet
exorbitant
,
rent
for
a
*NL*
home
at
the
time
.
Carrie
noticed
the
difference
between
the
size
of
the
*NL*
rooms
here
and
in
Chicago
and
mentioned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
not
find
anything
better
,
dear
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
``
unless
you
*NL*
go
into
one
of
the
old-fashioned
houses
,
and
then
you
wo
n't
have
any
of
*NL*
these
conveniences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
picked
out
the
new
abode
because
of
its
newness
and
bright
*NL*
wood-work
.
It
was
one
of
the
very
new
ones
supplied
with
steam
heat
,
*NL*
which
was
a
great
advantage
.
The
stationary
range
,
hot
and
cold
water
,
*NL*
dumb-waiter
,
speaking
tubes
,
and
call-bell
for
the
janitor
pleased
her
*NL*
very
much
.
She
had
enough
of
the
instincts
of
a
housewife
to
take
great
*NL*
satisfaction
in
these
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
made
arrangements
with
one
of
the
instalment
houses
whereby
*NL*
they
furnished
the
flat
complete
and
accepted
fifty
dollars
down
and
*NL*
ten
dollars
a
month
.
He
then
had
a
little
plate
,
bearing
the
name
G.
W.
*NL*
Wheeler
,
made
,
which
he
placed
on
his
letter-box
in
the
hall
.
It
sounded
*NL*
exceedingly
odd
to
Carrie
to
be
called
Mrs.
Wheeler
by
the
janitor
,
but
*NL*
in
time
she
became
used
to
it
and
looked
upon
the
name
as
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
house
details
settled
,
Hurstwood
visited
some
of
the
advertised
*NL*
opportunities
to
purchase
an
interest
in
some
flourishing
down-town
*NL*
bar
.
After
the
palatial
resort
in
Adams
Street
,
he
could
not
stomach
the
*NL*
commonplace
saloons
which
he
found
advertised
.
He
lost
a
number
of
days
*NL*
looking
up
these
and
finding
them
disagreeable
.
He
did
,
however
,
gain
*NL*
considerable
knowledge
by
talking
,
for
he
discovered
the
influence
of
*NL*
Tammany
Hall
and
the
value
of
standing
in
with
the
police
.
The
most
*NL*
profitable
and
flourishing
places
he
found
to
be
those
which
conducted
*NL*
anything
but
a
legitimate
business
,
such
as
that
controlled
by
*NL*
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
.
Elegant
back
rooms
and
private
drinking
booths
on
*NL*
the
second
floor
were
usually
adjuncts
of
very
profitable
places
.
He
*NL*
saw
by
portly
keepers
,
whose
shirt
fronts
shone
with
large
diamonds
,
*NL*
and
whose
clothes
were
properly
cut
,
that
the
liquor
business
here
,
*NL*
as
elsewhere
,
yielded
the
same
golden
profit
.
At
last
he
found
an
*NL*
individual
who
had
a
resort
in
Warren
Street
,
which
seemed
an
excellent
*NL*
venture
.
It
was
fairly
well-appearing
and
susceptible
of
improvement
.
*NL*
The
owner
claimed
the
business
to
be
excellent
,
and
it
certainly
looked
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
deal
with
a
very
good
class
of
people
,
''
he
told
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
``
Merchants
,
salesmen
,
and
professionals
.
It
's
a
well-dressed
class
.
No
*NL*
bums
.
We
do
n't
allow
'em
in
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
listened
to
the
cash-register
ring
,
and
watched
the
trade
for
*NL*
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
profitable
enough
for
two
,
is
it
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
see
for
yourself
if
you
're
any
judge
of
the
liquor
trade
,
''
said
*NL*
the
owner
.
``
This
is
only
one
of
the
two
places
I
have
.
The
other
is
down
*NL*
in
Nassau
Street
.
I
ca
n't
tend
to
them
both
alone
.
If
I
had
some
one
who
*NL*
knew
the
business
thoroughly
I
would
n't
mind
sharing
with
him
in
this
*NL*
one
and
letting
him
manage
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
experience
enough
,
''
said
Hurstwood
blandly
,
but
he
felt
a
*NL*
little
diffident
about
referring
to
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
suit
yourself
,
Mr.
Wheeler
,
''
said
the
proprietor
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
offered
a
third
interest
in
the
stock
,
fixtures
,
and
good-will
,
*NL*
and
this
in
return
for
a
thousand
dollars
and
managerial
ability
on
*NL*
the
part
of
the
one
who
should
come
in
.
There
was
no
property
involved
,
*NL*
because
the
owner
of
the
saloon
merely
rented
from
an
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
offer
was
genuine
enough
,
but
it
was
a
question
with
Hurstwood
*NL*
whether
a
third
interest
in
that
locality
could
be
made
to
yield
one
*NL*
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
month
,
which
he
figured
he
must
have
in
*NL*
order
to
meet
the
ordinary
family
expenses
and
be
comfortable
.
It
was
*NL*
not
the
time
,
however
,
after
many
failures
to
find
what
he
wanted
,
to
*NL*
hesitate
.
It
looked
as
though
a
third
would
pay
a
hundred
a
month
now
.
*NL*
By
judicious
management
and
improvement
,
it
might
be
made
to
pay
more
.
*NL*
Accordingly
he
agreed
to
enter
into
partnership
,
and
made
over
his
*NL*
thousand
dollars
,
preparing
to
enter
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
inclination
was
to
be
elated
,
and
he
confided
to
Carrie
*NL*
that
he
thought
he
had
made
an
excellent
arrangement
.
Time
,
however
,
*NL*
introduced
food
for
reflection
.
He
found
his
partner
to
be
very
*NL*
disagreeable
.
Frequently
he
was
the
worse
for
liquor
,
which
made
him
*NL*
surly
.
This
was
the
last
thing
which
Hurstwood
was
used
to
in
business
.
*NL*
Besides
,
the
business
varied
.
It
was
nothing
like
the
class
of
patronage
*NL*
which
he
had
enjoyed
in
Chicago
.
He
found
that
it
would
take
a
long
time
*NL*
to
make
friends
.
These
people
hurried
in
and
out
without
seeking
the
*NL*
pleasures
of
friendship
.
It
was
no
gathering
or
lounging
place
.
Whole
*NL*
days
and
weeks
passed
without
one
such
hearty
greeting
as
he
had
been
*NL*
wont
to
enjoy
every
day
in
Chicago
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
another
thing
,
Hurstwood
missed
the
celebrities
--
those
well-dressed
,
*NL*
elite
individuals
who
lend
grace
to
the
average
bars
and
bring
news
*NL*
from
far-off
and
exclusive
circles
.
He
did
not
see
one
such
in
a
month
.
*NL*
Evenings
,
when
still
at
his
post
,
he
would
occasionally
read
in
the
*NL*
evening
papers
incidents
concerning
celebrities
whom
he
knew
--
whom
*NL*
he
had
drunk
a
glass
with
many
a
time
.
They
would
visit
a
bar
like
*NL*
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
's
in
Chicago
,
or
the
Hoffman
House
,
uptown
,
but
he
*NL*
knew
that
he
would
never
see
them
down
here
.
Again
,
the
business
did
not
*NL*
pay
as
well
as
he
thought
.
It
increased
a
little
,
but
he
found
he
would
*NL*
have
to
watch
his
household
expenses
,
which
was
humiliating
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
very
beginning
it
was
a
delight
to
go
home
late
at
night
,
as
*NL*
he
did
,
and
find
Carrie
.
He
managed
to
run
up
and
take
dinner
with
her
*NL*
between
six
and
seven
,
and
to
remain
home
until
nine
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
but
the
novelty
of
this
waned
after
a
time
,
and
he
began
to
*NL*
feel
the
drag
of
his
duties
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
month
had
scarcely
passed
before
Carrie
said
in
a
very
natural
*NL*
way
:
``
I
think
I
'll
go
down
this
week
and
buy
a
dress
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
kind
?
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
something
for
street
wear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
answered
,
smiling
,
although
he
noted
mentally
that
it
*NL*
would
be
more
agreeable
to
his
finances
if
she
did
n't
.
Nothing
was
said
*NL*
about
it
the
next
day
,
but
the
following
morning
he
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
done
anything
about
your
dress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
a
few
moments
,
as
if
in
thought
,
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
mind
putting
it
off
a
few
days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Carrie
,
who
did
not
catch
the
drift
of
his
remarks
.
She
*NL*
had
never
thought
of
him
in
connection
with
money
troubles
before
.
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
This
investment
of
mine
is
*NL*
taking
a
lot
of
money
just
now
.
I
expect
to
get
it
all
back
shortly
,
but
*NL*
just
at
present
I
am
running
close
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
answered
Carrie
.
``
Why
,
certainly
,
dear
.
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
*NL*
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
necessary
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
her
acquiescence
,
there
was
something
about
the
way
Hurstwood
*NL*
spoke
which
reminded
Carrie
of
Drouet
and
his
little
deal
which
he
was
*NL*
always
about
to
put
through
.
It
was
only
the
thought
of
a
second
,
but
it
*NL*
was
a
beginning
.
It
was
something
new
in
her
thinking
of
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
things
followed
from
time
to
time
,
little
things
of
the
same
*NL*
sort
,
which
in
their
cumulative
effect
were
eventually
equal
to
a
full
*NL*
revelation
.
Carrie
was
not
dull
by
any
means
.
Two
persons
can
not
long
*NL*
dwell
together
without
coming
to
an
understanding
of
one
another
.
*NL*
The
mental
difficulties
of
an
individual
reveal
themselves
whether
*NL*
he
voluntarily
confesses
them
or
not
.
Trouble
gets
in
the
air
and
*NL*
contributes
gloom
,
which
speaks
for
itself
.
Hurstwood
dressed
as
nicely
*NL*
as
usual
,
but
they
were
the
same
clothes
he
had
in
Canada
.
Carrie
*NL*
noticed
that
he
did
not
install
a
large
wardrobe
,
though
his
own
was
*NL*
anything
but
large
.
She
noticed
,
also
,
that
he
did
not
suggest
many
*NL*
amusements
,
said
nothing
about
the
food
,
seemed
concerned
about
his
*NL*
business
.
This
was
not
the
easy
Hurstwood
of
Chicago
--
not
the
liberal
,
*NL*
opulent
Hurstwood
she
had
known
.
The
change
was
too
obvious
to
escape
*NL*
detection
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
time
she
began
to
feel
that
a
change
had
come
about
,
and
that
she
*NL*
was
not
in
his
confidence
.
He
was
evidently
secretive
and
kept
his
own
*NL*
counsel
.
She
found
herself
asking
him
questions
about
little
things
.
*NL*
This
is
a
disagreeable
state
to
a
woman
.
Great
love
makes
it
seem
*NL*
reasonable
,
sometimes
plausible
,
but
never
satisfactory
.
Where
great
*NL*
love
is
not
,
a
more
definite
and
less
satisfactory
conclusion
is
*NL*
reached
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Hurstwood
,
he
was
making
a
great
fight
against
the
difficulties
*NL*
of
a
changed
condition
.
He
was
too
shrewd
not
to
realise
the
tremendous
*NL*
mistake
he
had
made
,
and
appreciate
that
he
had
done
well
in
getting
*NL*
where
he
was
,
and
yet
he
could
not
help
contrasting
his
present
state
*NL*
with
his
former
,
hour
after
hour
,
and
day
after
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
he
had
the
disagreeable
fear
of
meeting
old-time
friends
,
ever
*NL*
since
one
such
encounter
which
he
made
shortly
after
his
arrival
in
the
*NL*
city
.
It
was
in
Broadway
that
he
saw
a
man
approaching
him
whom
he
*NL*
knew
.
There
was
no
time
for
simulating
non-recognition
.
The
exchange
of
*NL*
glances
had
been
too
sharp
,
the
knowledge
of
each
other
too
apparent
.
*NL*
So
the
friend
,
a
buyer
for
one
of
the
Chicago
wholesale
houses
,
felt
,
*NL*
perforce
,
the
necessity
of
stopping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
?
''
he
said
,
extending
his
hand
with
an
evident
mixture
of
*NL*
feeling
and
a
lack
of
plausible
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
equally
embarrassed
.
``
How
is
it
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
;
I
'm
down
here
doing
a
little
buying
.
Are
you
located
here
*NL*
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
``
I
have
a
place
down
in
Warren
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
''
said
the
friend
.
``
Glad
to
hear
it
.
I
'll
come
down
and
see
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
,
''
said
the
other
,
smiling
affably
and
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
never
asked
for
my
number
,
''
thought
Hurstwood
;
``
he
would
n't
think
*NL*
of
coming
.
''
He
wiped
his
forehead
,
which
had
grown
damp
,
and
hoped
*NL*
sincerely
he
would
meet
no
one
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
things
told
upon
his
good-nature
,
such
as
it
was
.
His
one
hope
was
*NL*
that
things
would
change
for
the
better
in
a
money
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
Carrie
.
His
furniture
was
being
paid
for
.
He
was
maintaining
his
*NL*
position
.
As
for
Carrie
,
the
amusements
he
could
give
her
would
have
*NL*
to
do
for
the
present
.
He
could
probably
keep
up
his
pretensions
*NL*
sufficiently
long
without
exposure
to
make
good
,
and
then
all
would
*NL*
be
well
.
He
failed
therein
to
take
account
of
the
frailties
of
human
*NL*
nature
--
the
difficulties
of
matrimonial
life
.
Carrie
was
young
.
With
*NL*
him
and
with
her
varying
mental
states
were
common
.
At
any
moment
the
*NL*
extremes
of
feeling
might
be
anti-polarised
at
the
dinner
table
.
This
*NL*
often
happens
in
the
best
regulated
families
.
Little
things
brought
out
*NL*
on
such
occasions
need
great
love
to
obliterate
them
afterward
.
Where
*NL*
that
is
not
,
both
parties
count
two
and
two
and
make
a
problem
after
a
*NL*
while

Chapter
XXXI

A
PET
OF
GOOD
FORTUNE
--
BROADWAY
FLAUNTS
ITS
JOYS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
the
city
and
his
own
situation
on
Hurstwood
was
paralleled
*NL*
in
the
case
of
Carrie
,
who
accepted
the
things
which
fortune
provided
*NL*
with
the
most
genial
good-nature
.
New
York
,
despite
her
first
expression
*NL*
of
disapproval
,
soon
interested
her
exceedingly
.
Its
clear
atmosphere
,
*NL*
more
populous
thoroughfares
,
and
peculiar
indifference
struck
her
*NL*
forcibly
.
She
had
never
seen
such
a
little
flat
as
hers
,
and
yet
it
soon
*NL*
enlisted
her
affection
.
The
new
furniture
made
an
excellent
showing
,
*NL*
the
sideboard
which
Hurstwood
himself
arranged
gleamed
brightly
.
The
*NL*
furniture
for
each
room
was
appropriate
,
and
in
the
so-called
parlour
,
*NL*
or
front
room
,
was
installed
a
piano
,
because
Carrie
said
she
would
like
*NL*
to
learn
to
play
.
She
kept
a
servant
and
developed
rapidly
in
household
*NL*
tactics
and
information
.
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
felt
*NL*
settled
,
and
somewhat
justified
in
the
eyes
of
society
as
she
conceived
*NL*
of
it
.
Her
thoughts
were
merry
and
innocent
enough
.
For
a
long
while
she
*NL*
concerned
herself
over
the
arrangement
of
New
York
flats
,
and
wondered
*NL*
at
ten
families
living
in
one
building
and
all
remaining
strange
and
*NL*
indifferent
to
each
other
.
She
also
marvelled
at
the
whistles
of
the
*NL*
hundreds
of
vessels
in
the
harbour
--
the
long
,
low
cries
of
the
Sound
*NL*
steamers
and
ferry-boats
when
fog
was
on
.
The
mere
fact
that
these
*NL*
things
spoke
from
the
sea
made
them
wonderful
.
She
looked
much
at
what
*NL*
she
could
see
of
the
Hudson
from
her
west
windows
and
of
the
great
city
*NL*
building
up
rapidly
on
either
hand
.
It
was
much
to
ponder
over
,
and
*NL*
sufficed
to
entertain
her
for
more
than
a
year
without
becoming
stale
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
another
thing
,
Hurstwood
was
exceedingly
interesting
in
his
*NL*
affection
for
her
.
Troubled
as
he
was
,
he
never
exposed
his
difficulties
*NL*
to
her
.
He
carried
himself
with
the
same
self-important
air
,
took
his
*NL*
new
state
with
easy
familiarity
,
and
rejoiced
in
Carrie
's
proclivities
*NL*
and
successes
.
Each
evening
he
arrived
promptly
to
dinner
,
and
found
the
*NL*
little
dining-room
a
most
inviting
spectacle
.
In
a
way
,
the
smallness
*NL*
of
the
room
added
to
its
luxury
.
It
looked
full
and
replete
.
The
*NL*
white-covered
table
was
arrayed
with
pretty
dishes
and
lighted
with
a
*NL*
four-armed
candelabra
,
each
light
of
which
was
topped
with
a
red
shade
.
*NL*
Between
Carrie
and
the
girl
the
steaks
and
chops
came
out
all
right
,
and
*NL*
canned
goods
did
the
rest
for
a
while
.
Carrie
studied
the
art
of
making
*NL*
biscuit
,
and
soon
reached
the
stage
where
she
could
show
a
plate
of
*NL*
light
,
palatable
morsels
for
her
labour
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
the
second
,
third
,
and
fourth
months
passed
.
Winter
came
,
*NL*
and
with
it
a
feeling
that
indoors
was
best
,
so
that
the
attending
of
*NL*
theatres
was
not
much
talked
of
.
Hurstwood
made
great
efforts
to
meet
*NL*
all
expenditures
without
a
show
of
feeling
one
way
or
the
other
.
*NL*
He
pretended
that
he
was
reinvesting
his
money
in
strengthening
the
*NL*
business
for
greater
ends
in
the
future
.
He
contented
himself
with
*NL*
a
very
moderate
allowance
of
personal
apparel
,
and
rarely
suggested
*NL*
anything
for
Carrie
.
Thus
the
first
winter
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
year
,
the
business
which
Hurstwood
managed
did
increase
*NL*
somewhat
.
He
got
out
of
it
regularly
the
$
150
per
month
which
he
had
*NL*
anticipated
.
Unfortunately
,
by
this
time
Carrie
had
reached
certain
*NL*
conclusions
,
and
he
had
scraped
up
a
few
acquaintances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
of
a
passive
and
receptive
rather
than
an
active
and
aggressive
*NL*
nature
,
Carrie
accepted
the
situation
.
Her
state
seemed
satisfactory
*NL*
enough
.
Once
in
a
while
they
would
go
to
a
theatre
together
,
*NL*
occasionally
in
season
to
the
beaches
and
different
points
about
the
*NL*
city
,
but
they
picked
up
no
acquaintances
.
Hurstwood
naturally
abandoned
*NL*
his
show
of
fine
manners
with
her
and
modified
his
attitude
to
one
*NL*
of
easy
familiarity
.
There
were
no
misunderstandings
,
no
apparent
*NL*
differences
of
opinion
.
In
fact
,
without
money
or
visiting
friends
,
*NL*
he
led
a
life
which
could
neither
arouse
jealousy
nor
comment
.
Carrie
*NL*
rather
sympathised
with
his
efforts
and
thought
nothing
upon
her
lack
*NL*
of
entertainment
such
as
she
had
enjoyed
in
Chicago
.
New
York
as
a
*NL*
corporate
entity
and
her
flat
temporarily
seemed
sufficient
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
Hurstwood
's
business
increased
,
he
,
as
stated
,
began
to
*NL*
pick
up
acquaintances
.
He
also
began
to
allow
himself
more
clothes
.
*NL*
He
convinced
himself
that
his
home
life
was
very
precious
to
him
,
but
*NL*
allowed
that
he
could
occasionally
stay
away
from
dinner
.
The
first
time
*NL*
he
did
this
he
sent
a
message
saying
that
he
would
be
detained
.
Carrie
*NL*
ate
alone
,
and
wished
that
it
might
not
happen
again
.
The
second
time
,
*NL*
also
,
he
sent
word
,
but
at
the
last
moment
.
The
third
time
he
forgot
*NL*
entirely
and
explained
afterwards
.
These
events
were
months
apart
,
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
were
you
,
George
?
''
asked
Carrie
,
after
the
first
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tied
up
at
the
office
,
''
he
said
genially
.
``
There
were
some
accounts
I
*NL*
had
to
straighten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
you
could
n't
get
home
,
''
she
said
kindly
.
``
I
was
fixing
to
*NL*
have
such
a
nice
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
time
he
gave
a
similar
excuse
,
but
the
third
time
the
feeling
*NL*
about
it
in
Carrie
's
mind
was
a
little
bit
out
of
the
ordinary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
get
home
,
''
he
said
,
when
he
came
in
later
in
the
evening
,
``
I
*NL*
was
so
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
you
have
sent
me
word
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
to
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
you
know
I
forgot
it
until
it
was
too
late
*NL*
to
do
any
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
had
such
a
good
dinner
!
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
it
so
happened
that
from
his
observations
of
Carrie
he
began
to
*NL*
imagine
that
she
was
of
the
thoroughly
domestic
type
of
mind
.
He
really
*NL*
thought
,
after
a
year
,
that
her
chief
expression
in
life
was
finding
its
*NL*
natural
channel
in
household
duties
.
Notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
*NL*
had
observed
her
act
in
Chicago
,
and
that
during
the
past
year
he
had
*NL*
only
seen
her
limited
in
her
relations
to
her
flat
and
him
by
conditions
*NL*
which
he
made
,
and
that
she
had
not
gained
any
friends
or
associates
,
he
*NL*
drew
this
peculiar
conclusion
.
With
it
came
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
*NL*
in
having
a
wife
who
could
thus
be
content
,
and
this
satisfaction
worked
*NL*
its
natural
result
.
That
is
,
since
he
imagined
he
saw
her
satisfied
,
*NL*
he
felt
called
upon
to
give
only
that
which
contributed
to
such
*NL*
satisfaction
.
He
supplied
the
furniture
,
the
decorations
,
the
food
,
and
*NL*
the
necessary
clothing
.
Thoughts
of
entertaining
her
,
leading
her
out
*NL*
into
the
shine
and
show
of
life
,
grew
less
and
less
.
He
felt
attracted
*NL*
to
the
outer
world
,
but
did
not
think
she
would
care
to
go
along
.
Once
*NL*
he
went
to
the
theatre
alone
.
Another
time
he
joined
a
couple
of
his
*NL*
new
friends
at
an
evening
game
of
poker
.
Since
his
money-feathers
were
*NL*
beginning
to
grow
again
he
felt
like
sprucing
about
.
All
this
,
however
,
*NL*
in
a
much
less
imposing
way
than
had
been
his
wont
in
Chicago
.
He
*NL*
avoided
the
gay
places
where
he
would
be
apt
to
meet
those
who
had
known
*NL*
him
.
Now
,
Carrie
began
to
feel
this
in
various
sensory
ways
.
She
was
*NL*
not
the
kind
to
be
seriously
disturbed
by
his
actions
.
Not
loving
him
*NL*
greatly
,
she
could
not
be
jealous
in
a
disturbing
way
.
In
fact
,
she
was
*NL*
not
jealous
at
all
.
Hurstwood
was
pleased
with
her
placid
manner
,
when
*NL*
he
should
have
duly
considered
it
.
When
he
did
not
come
home
it
did
*NL*
not
seem
anything
like
a
terrible
thing
to
her
.
She
gave
him
credit
for
*NL*
having
the
usual
allurements
of
men
--
people
to
talk
to
,
places
to
stop
,
*NL*
friends
to
consult
with
.
She
was
perfectly
willing
that
he
should
enjoy
*NL*
himself
in
his
way
,
but
she
did
not
care
to
be
neglected
herself
.
Her
*NL*
state
still
seemed
fairly
reasonable
,
however
.
All
she
did
observe
was
*NL*
that
Hurstwood
was
somewhat
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
in
the
second
year
of
their
residence
in
Seventy-eighth
Street
*NL*
the
flat
across
the
hall
from
Carrie
became
vacant
,
and
into
it
moved
*NL*
a
very
handsome
young
woman
and
her
husband
,
with
both
of
whom
Carrie
*NL*
afterwards
became
acquainted
.
This
was
brought
about
solely
by
the
*NL*
arrangement
of
the
flats
,
which
were
united
in
one
place
,
as
it
were
,
by
*NL*
the
dumb-waiter
.
This
useful
elevator
,
by
which
fuel
,
groceries
,
and
the
*NL*
like
were
sent
up
from
the
basement
,
and
garbage
and
waste
sent
down
,
*NL*
was
used
by
both
residents
of
one
floor
;
that
is
,
a
small
door
opened
*NL*
into
it
from
each
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
occupants
of
both
flats
answered
to
the
whistle
of
the
janitor
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
they
would
stand
face
to
face
when
they
opened
the
*NL*
dumb-waiter
doors
.
One
morning
,
when
Carrie
went
to
remove
her
paper
,
*NL*
the
newcomer
,
a
handsome
brunette
of
perhaps
twenty-three
years
of
age
,
*NL*
was
there
for
a
like
purpose
.
She
was
in
a
night-robe
and
dressing-gown
,
*NL*
with
her
hair
very
much
tousled
,
but
she
looked
so
pretty
and
*NL*
good-natured
that
Carrie
instantly
conceived
a
liking
for
her
.
The
*NL*
newcomer
did
no
more
than
smile
shamefacedly
,
but
it
was
sufficient
.
*NL*
Carrie
felt
that
she
would
like
to
know
her
,
and
a
similar
feeling
*NL*
stirred
in
the
mind
of
the
other
,
who
admired
Carrie
's
innocent
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
real
pretty
woman
who
has
moved
in
next
door
,
''
said
Carrie
to
*NL*
Hurstwood
at
the
breakfast
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
they
?
''
asked
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
The
name
on
the
bell
is
Vance
.
Some
one
*NL*
over
there
plays
beautifully
.
I
guess
it
must
be
she
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
never
can
tell
what
sort
of
people
you
're
living
next
to
in
*NL*
this
town
,
can
you
?
''
said
Hurstwood
,
expressing
the
customary
New
York
*NL*
opinion
about
neighbours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
think
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
I
have
been
in
this
house
with
nine
other
*NL*
families
for
over
a
year
and
I
do
n't
know
a
soul
.
These
people
have
been
*NL*
here
over
a
month
and
I
have
n't
seen
any
one
before
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
as
well
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
You
never
know
who
you
're
going
to
*NL*
get
in
with
.
Some
of
these
people
are
pretty
bad
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
so
,
''
said
Carrie
,
agreeably
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
turned
to
other
things
,
and
Carrie
thought
no
more
upon
*NL*
the
subject
until
a
day
or
two
later
,
when
,
going
out
to
market
,
she
*NL*
encountered
Mrs.
Vance
coming
in
.
The
latter
recognised
her
and
nodded
,
*NL*
for
which
Carrie
returned
a
smile
.
This
settled
the
probability
of
*NL*
acquaintanceship
.
If
there
had
been
no
faint
recognition
on
this
*NL*
occasion
,
there
would
have
been
no
future
association
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
saw
no
more
of
Mrs.
Vance
for
several
weeks
,
but
she
heard
her
*NL*
play
through
the
thin
walls
which
divided
the
front
rooms
of
the
flats
,
*NL*
and
was
pleased
by
the
merry
selection
of
pieces
and
the
brilliance
*NL*
of
their
rendition
.
She
could
play
only
moderately
herself
,
and
such
*NL*
variety
as
Mrs.
Vance
exercised
bordered
,
for
Carrie
,
upon
the
verge
of
*NL*
great
art
.
Everything
she
had
seen
and
heard
thus
far
--
the
merest
scraps
*NL*
and
shadows
--
indicated
that
these
people
were
,
in
a
measure
,
refined
and
*NL*
in
comfortable
circumstances
.
So
Carrie
was
ready
for
any
extension
of
*NL*
the
friendship
which
might
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Carrie
's
bell
rang
and
the
servant
,
who
was
in
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
pressed
the
button
which
caused
the
front
door
of
the
general
entrance
*NL*
on
the
ground
floor
to
be
electrically
unlatched
.
When
Carrie
waited
at
*NL*
her
own
door
on
the
third
floor
to
see
who
it
might
be
coming
up
to
call
*NL*
on
her
,
Mrs.
Vance
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
'll
excuse
me
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
went
out
a
while
ago
and
forgot
*NL*
my
outside
key
,
so
I
thought
I
'd
ring
your
bell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
common
trick
of
other
residents
of
the
building
,
whenever
*NL*
they
had
forgotten
their
outside
keys
.
They
did
not
apologise
for
it
,
*NL*
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
'm
glad
you
did
.
I
do
the
same
thing
*NL*
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
just
delightful
weather
?
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
,
pausing
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
after
a
few
more
preliminaries
,
this
visiting
acquaintance
was
*NL*
well
launched
,
and
in
the
young
Mrs.
Vance
Carrie
found
an
agreeable
*NL*
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
several
occasions
Carrie
visited
her
and
was
visited
.
Both
flats
were
*NL*
good
to
look
upon
,
though
that
of
the
Vances
tended
somewhat
more
to
the
*NL*
luxurious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
come
over
this
evening
and
meet
my
husband
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Vance
,
not
long
after
their
intimacy
began
.
``
He
wants
to
meet
you
.
You
*NL*
play
cards
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
'll
have
a
game
of
cards
.
If
your
husband
comes
home
bring
him
*NL*
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
coming
to
dinner
to-night
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
he
does
come
we
'll
call
him
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
acquiesced
,
and
that
evening
met
the
portly
Vance
,
an
individual
*NL*
a
few
years
younger
than
Hurstwood
,
and
who
owed
his
seemingly
*NL*
comfortable
matrimonial
state
much
more
to
his
money
than
to
his
good
*NL*
looks
.
He
thought
well
of
Carrie
upon
the
first
glance
and
laid
himself
*NL*
out
to
be
genial
,
teaching
her
a
new
game
of
cards
and
talking
to
her
*NL*
about
New
York
and
its
pleasures
.
Mrs.
Vance
played
some
upon
the
piano
,
*NL*
and
at
last
Hurstwood
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
,
''
he
said
to
Mrs.
Vance
when
Carrie
*NL*
introduced
him
,
showing
much
of
the
old
grace
which
had
captivated
*NL*
Carrie
.
``
Did
you
think
your
wife
had
run
away
?
''
said
Mr.
Vance
,
*NL*
extending
his
hand
upon
introduction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
but
what
she
might
have
found
a
better
husband
,
''
said
*NL*
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
turned
his
attention
to
Mrs.
Vance
,
and
in
a
flash
Carrie
saw
*NL*
again
what
she
for
some
time
had
subconsciously
missed
in
Hurstwood
--
the
*NL*
adroitness
and
flattery
of
which
he
was
capable
.
She
also
saw
that
she
*NL*
was
not
well
dressed
--
not
nearly
as
well
dressed
--
as
Mrs.
Vance
.
These
*NL*
were
not
vague
ideas
any
longer
.
Her
situation
was
cleared
up
for
her
.
*NL*
She
felt
that
her
life
was
becoming
stale
,
and
therein
she
felt
cause
*NL*
for
gloom
.
The
old
helpful
,
urging
melancholy
was
restored
.
The
desirous
*NL*
Carrie
was
whispered
to
concerning
her
possibilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
immediate
results
to
this
awakening
,
for
Carrie
had
little
*NL*
power
of
initiative
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
she
seemed
ever
capable
of
*NL*
getting
herself
into
the
tide
of
change
where
she
would
be
easily
borne
*NL*
along
.
Hurstwood
noticed
nothing
.
He
had
been
unconscious
of
the
marked
*NL*
contrasts
which
Carrie
had
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
even
detect
the
shade
of
melancholy
which
settled
in
her
*NL*
eyes
.
Worst
of
all
,
she
now
began
to
feel
the
loneliness
of
the
flat
and
*NL*
seek
the
company
of
Mrs.
Vance
,
who
liked
her
exceedingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
to
the
matinee
this
afternoon
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
,
who
had
*NL*
stepped
across
into
Carrie
's
flat
one
morning
,
still
arrayed
in
a
soft
*NL*
pink
dressing-gown
,
which
she
had
donned
upon
rising
.
Hurstwood
and
*NL*
Vance
had
gone
their
separate
ways
nearly
an
hour
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Carrie
,
noticing
the
air
of
the
petted
and
*NL*
well-groomed
woman
in
Mrs.
Vance
's
general
appearance
.
She
looked
as
*NL*
though
she
was
dearly
loved
and
her
every
wish
gratified
.
``
What
shall
we
*NL*
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
want
to
see
Nat
Goodwin
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
.
``
I
do
think
he
is
*NL*
the
jolliest
actor
.
The
papers
say
this
is
such
a
good
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
will
we
have
to
start
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
at
once
and
walk
down
Broadway
from
Thirty-fourth
Street
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Vance
.
``
It
's
such
an
interesting
walk
.
He
's
at
the
Madison
*NL*
Square
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
glad
to
go
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
How
much
will
we
have
to
pay
for
*NL*
seats
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
more
than
a
dollar
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
departed
,
and
at
one
o'clock
reappeared
,
stunningly
arrayed
*NL*
in
a
dark-blue
walking
dress
,
with
a
nobby
hat
to
match
.
Carrie
had
*NL*
gotten
herself
up
charmingly
enough
,
but
this
woman
pained
her
by
*NL*
contrast
.
She
seemed
to
have
so
many
dainty
little
things
which
Carrie
*NL*
had
not
.
There
were
trinkets
of
gold
,
an
elegant
green
leather
purse
set
*NL*
with
her
initials
,
a
fancy
handkerchief
,
exceedingly
rich
in
design
,
and
*NL*
the
like
.
Carrie
felt
that
she
needed
more
and
better
clothes
to
compare
*NL*
with
this
woman
,
and
that
any
one
looking
at
the
two
would
pick
Mrs.
*NL*
Vance
for
her
raiment
alone
.
It
was
a
trying
,
though
rather
unjust
*NL*
thought
,
for
Carrie
had
now
developed
an
equally
pleasing
figure
,
and
*NL*
had
grown
in
comeliness
until
she
was
a
thoroughly
attractive
type
of
*NL*
her
colour
of
beauty
.
There
was
some
difference
in
the
clothing
of
the
*NL*
two
,
both
of
quality
and
age
,
but
this
difference
was
not
especially
*NL*
noticeable
.
It
served
,
however
,
to
augment
Carrie
's
dissatisfaction
with
*NL*
her
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
walk
down
Broadway
,
then
as
now
,
was
one
of
the
remarkable
features
*NL*
of
the
city
.
There
gathered
,
before
the
matinee
and
afterwards
,
not
only
*NL*
all
the
pretty
women
who
love
a
showy
parade
,
but
the
men
who
love
to
*NL*
gaze
upon
and
admire
them
.
It
was
a
very
imposing
procession
of
pretty
*NL*
faces
and
fine
clothes
.
Women
appeared
in
their
very
best
hats
,
shoes
,
*NL*
and
gloves
,
and
walked
arm
in
arm
on
their
way
to
the
fine
shops
or
*NL*
theatres
strung
along
from
Fourteenth
to
Thirty-fourth
Streets
.
Equally
*NL*
the
men
paraded
with
the
very
latest
they
could
afford
.
A
tailor
might
*NL*
have
secured
hints
on
suit
measurements
,
a
shoemaker
on
proper
lasts
and
*NL*
colours
,
a
hatter
on
hats
.
It
was
literally
true
that
if
a
lover
of
*NL*
fine
clothes
secured
a
new
suit
,
it
was
sure
to
have
its
first
airing
on
*NL*
Broadway
.
So
true
and
well
understood
was
this
fact
,
that
several
years
*NL*
later
a
popular
song
,
detailing
this
and
other
facts
concerning
the
*NL*
afternoon
parade
on
matinee
days
,
and
entitled
``
What
Right
Has
He
on
*NL*
Broadway
?
''
was
published
,
and
had
quite
a
vogue
about
the
music-halls
of
*NL*
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
her
stay
in
the
city
,
Carrie
had
never
heard
of
this
showy
*NL*
parade
;
had
never
even
been
on
Broadway
when
it
was
taking
place
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
it
was
a
familiar
thing
to
Mrs.
Vance
,
who
not
only
knew
of
*NL*
it
as
an
entity
,
but
had
often
been
in
it
,
going
purposely
to
see
and
be
*NL*
seen
,
to
create
a
stir
with
her
beauty
and
dispel
any
tendency
to
fall
*NL*
short
in
dressiness
by
contrasting
herself
with
the
beauty
and
fashion
*NL*
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
stepped
along
easily
enough
after
they
got
out
of
the
car
at
*NL*
Thirty-fourth
Street
,
but
soon
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
lovely
company
*NL*
which
swarmed
by
and
with
them
as
they
proceeded
.
She
noticed
suddenly
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Vance
's
manner
had
rather
stiffened
under
the
gaze
of
handsome
*NL*
men
and
elegantly
dressed
ladies
,
whose
glances
were
not
modified
by
any
*NL*
rules
of
propriety
.
To
stare
seemed
the
proper
and
natural
thing
.
Carrie
*NL*
found
herself
stared
at
and
ogled
.
Men
in
flawless
top-coats
,
high
hats
,
*NL*
and
silver-headed
walking
sticks
elbowed
near
and
looked
too
often
into
*NL*
conscious
eyes
.
Ladies
rustled
by
in
dresses
of
stiff
cloth
,
shedding
*NL*
affected
smiles
and
perfume
.
Carrie
noticed
among
them
the
sprinkling
*NL*
of
goodness
and
the
heavy
percentage
of
vice
.
The
rouged
and
powdered
*NL*
cheeks
and
lips
,
the
scented
hair
,
the
large
,
misty
,
and
languorous
*NL*
eye
,
were
common
enough
.
With
a
start
she
awoke
to
find
that
she
was
*NL*
in
fashion
's
crowd
,
on
parade
in
a
show
place
--
and
such
a
show
place
!
*NL*
Jewellers
'
windows
gleamed
along
the
path
with
remarkable
frequency
.
*NL*
Florist
shops
,
furriers
,
haberdashers
,
confectioners
--
all
followed
in
*NL*
rapid
succession
.
The
street
was
full
of
coaches
.
Pompous
doormen
*NL*
in
immense
coats
,
shiny
brass
belts
and
buttons
,
waited
in
front
of
*NL*
expensive
salesrooms
.
Coachmen
in
tan
boots
,
white
tights
,
and
blue
*NL*
jackets
waited
obsequiously
for
the
mistresses
of
carriages
who
were
*NL*
shopping
inside
.
The
whole
street
bore
the
flavour
of
riches
and
show
,
*NL*
and
Carrie
felt
that
she
was
not
of
it
.
She
could
not
,
for
the
life
*NL*
of
her
,
assume
the
attitude
and
smartness
of
Mrs.
Vance
,
who
,
in
her
*NL*
beauty
,
was
all
assurance
.
She
could
only
imagine
that
it
must
be
*NL*
evident
to
many
that
she
was
the
less
handsomely
dressed
of
the
two
.
*NL*
It
cut
her
to
the
quick
,
and
she
resolved
that
she
would
not
come
here
*NL*
again
until
she
looked
better
.
At
the
same
time
she
longed
to
feel
the
*NL*
delight
of
parading
here
as
an
equal
.
Ah
,
then
she
would
be
happy
!

THE
FEAST
OF
BELSHAZZAR
--
A
SEER
TO
TRANSLATE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Such
feelings
as
were
generated
in
Carrie
by
this
walk
put
her
in
an
*NL*
exceedingly
receptive
mood
for
the
pathos
which
followed
in
the
play
.
*NL*
The
actor
whom
they
had
gone
to
see
had
achieved
his
popularity
by
*NL*
presenting
a
mellow
type
of
comedy
,
in
which
sufficient
sorrow
was
*NL*
introduced
to
lend
contrast
and
relief
to
humour
.
For
Carrie
,
as
we
well
*NL*
know
,
the
stage
had
a
great
attraction
.
She
had
never
forgotten
her
one
*NL*
histrionic
achievement
in
Chicago
.
It
dwelt
in
her
mind
and
occupied
her
*NL*
consciousness
during
many
long
afternoons
in
which
her
rocking-chair
*NL*
and
her
latest
novel
contributed
the
only
pleasures
of
her
state
.
Never
*NL*
could
she
witness
a
play
without
having
her
own
ability
vividly
brought
*NL*
to
consciousness
.
Some
scenes
made
her
long
to
be
a
part
of
them
--
to
*NL*
give
expression
to
the
feelings
which
she
,
in
the
place
of
the
character
*NL*
represented
,
would
feel
.
Almost
invariably
she
would
carry
the
vivid
*NL*
imaginations
away
with
her
and
brood
over
them
the
next
day
alone
.
She
*NL*
lived
as
much
in
these
things
as
in
the
realities
which
made
up
her
*NL*
daily
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
often
that
she
came
to
the
play
stirred
to
her
heart
's
core
*NL*
by
actualities
.
To-day
a
low
song
of
longing
had
been
set
singing
in
her
*NL*
heart
by
the
finery
,
the
merriment
,
the
beauty
she
had
seen
.
Oh
,
these
*NL*
women
who
had
passed
her
by
,
hundreds
and
hundreds
strong
,
who
were
*NL*
they
?
Whence
came
the
rich
,
elegant
dresses
,
the
astonishingly
coloured
*NL*
buttons
,
the
knick-knacks
of
silver
and
gold
?
Where
were
these
lovely
*NL*
creatures
housed
?
Amid
what
elegancies
of
carved
furniture
,
decorated
*NL*
walls
,
elaborate
tapestries
did
they
move
?
Where
were
their
rich
*NL*
apartments
,
loaded
with
all
that
money
could
provide
?
In
what
stables
*NL*
champed
these
sleek
,
nervous
horses
and
rested
the
gorgeous
carriages
?
*NL*
Where
lounged
the
richly
groomed
footmen
?
Oh
,
the
mansions
,
the
lights
,
*NL*
the
perfume
,
the
loaded
boudoirs
and
tables
!
New
York
must
be
filled
*NL*
with
such
bowers
,
or
the
beautiful
,
insolent
,
supercilious
creatures
*NL*
could
not
be
.
Some
hothouses
held
them
.
It
ached
her
to
know
that
she
*NL*
was
not
one
of
them
--
that
,
alas
,
she
had
dreamed
a
dream
and
it
had
not
*NL*
come
true
.
She
wondered
at
her
own
solitude
these
two
years
past
--
her
*NL*
indifference
to
the
fact
that
she
had
never
achieved
what
she
had
*NL*
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
play
was
one
of
those
drawing-room
concoctions
in
which
charmingly
*NL*
overdressed
ladies
and
gentlemen
suffer
the
pangs
of
love
and
jealousy
*NL*
amid
gilded
surroundings
.
Such
bon-mots
are
ever
enticing
to
those
who
*NL*
have
all
their
days
longed
for
such
material
surroundings
and
have
never
*NL*
had
them
gratified
.
They
have
the
charm
of
showing
suffering
under
ideal
*NL*
conditions
.
Who
would
not
grieve
upon
a
gilded
chair
?
Who
would
not
*NL*
suffer
amid
perfumed
tapestries
,
cushioned
furniture
,
and
liveried
*NL*
servants
?
Grief
under
such
circumstances
becomes
an
enticing
thing
.
*NL*
Carrie
longed
to
be
of
it
.
She
wanted
to
take
her
sufferings
,
whatever
*NL*
they
were
,
in
such
a
world
,
or
failing
that
,
at
least
to
simulate
them
*NL*
under
such
charming
conditions
upon
the
stage
.
So
affected
was
her
*NL*
mind
by
what
she
had
seen
,
that
the
play
now
seemed
an
extraordinarily
*NL*
beautiful
thing
.
She
was
soon
lost
in
the
world
it
represented
,
and
*NL*
wished
that
she
might
never
return
.
Between
the
acts
she
studied
the
*NL*
galaxy
of
matinee
attendants
in
front
rows
and
boxes
,
and
conceived
a
*NL*
new
idea
of
the
possibilities
of
New
York
.
She
was
sure
she
had
not
seen
*NL*
it
all
--
that
the
city
was
one
whirl
of
pleasure
and
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
out
,
the
same
Broadway
taught
her
a
sharper
lesson
.
The
scene
she
*NL*
had
witnessed
coming
down
was
now
augmented
and
at
its
height
.
Such
*NL*
a
crush
of
finery
and
folly
she
had
never
seen
.
It
clinched
her
*NL*
convictions
concerning
her
state
.
She
had
not
lived
,
could
not
lay
claim
*NL*
to
having
lived
,
until
something
of
this
had
come
into
her
own
life
.
*NL*
Women
were
spending
money
like
water
;
she
could
see
that
in
every
*NL*
elegant
shop
she
passed
.
Flowers
,
candy
,
jewelry
,
seemed
the
principal
*NL*
things
in
which
the
elegant
dames
were
interested
.
And
she
--
she
had
*NL*
scarcely
enough
pin
money
to
indulge
in
such
outings
as
this
a
few
times
*NL*
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
the
pretty
little
flat
seemed
a
commonplace
thing
.
It
was
not
*NL*
what
the
rest
of
the
world
was
enjoying
.
She
saw
the
servant
working
at
*NL*
dinner
with
an
indifferent
eye
.
In
her
mind
were
running
scenes
of
the
*NL*
play
.
Particularly
she
remembered
one
beautiful
actress
--
the
sweetheart
*NL*
who
had
been
wooed
and
won
.
The
grace
of
this
woman
had
won
Carrie
's
*NL*
heart
.
Her
dresses
had
been
all
that
art
could
suggest
,
her
sufferings
*NL*
had
been
so
real
.
The
anguish
which
she
had
portrayed
Carrie
could
feel
.
*NL*
It
was
done
as
she
was
sure
she
could
do
it
.
There
were
places
in
which
*NL*
she
could
even
do
better
.
Hence
she
repeated
the
lines
to
herself
.
Oh
,
*NL*
if
she
could
only
have
such
a
part
,
how
broad
would
be
her
life
!
She
,
*NL*
too
,
could
act
appealingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Hurstwood
came
,
Carrie
was
moody
.
She
was
sitting
,
rocking
and
*NL*
thinking
,
and
did
not
care
to
have
her
enticing
imaginations
broken
in
*NL*
upon
;
so
she
said
little
or
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
Carrie
?
''
said
Hurstwood
after
a
time
,
noticing
her
*NL*
quiet
,
almost
moody
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
do
n't
feel
very
well
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
sick
,
are
you
?
''
he
asked
,
approaching
very
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
she
said
,
almost
pettishly
,
``
I
just
do
n't
feel
very
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
too
bad
,
''
he
said
,
stepping
away
and
adjusting
his
vest
*NL*
after
his
slight
bending
over
.
``
I
was
thinking
we
might
go
to
a
show
*NL*
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
go
,
''
said
Carrie
,
annoyed
that
her
fine
visions
should
*NL*
have
thus
been
broken
into
and
driven
out
of
her
mind
.
``
I
've
been
to
the
*NL*
matinee
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
have
?
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
What
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Gold
Mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
good
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
do
n't
want
to
go
again
to
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
do
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
wakened
out
of
her
melancholia
and
called
to
the
dinner
*NL*
table
,
she
changed
her
mind
.
A
little
food
in
the
stomach
does
wonders
.
*NL*
She
went
again
,
and
in
so
doing
temporarily
recovered
her
equanimity
.
*NL*
The
great
awakening
blow
had
,
however
,
been
delivered
.
As
often
as
she
*NL*
might
recover
from
these
discontented
thoughts
now
,
they
would
occur
*NL*
again
.
Time
and
repetition
--
ah
,
the
wonder
of
it
!
The
dropping
water
and
*NL*
the
solid
stone
--
how
utterly
it
yields
at
last
!
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
this
matinee
experience
--
perhaps
a
month
--
Mrs.
Vance
*NL*
invited
Carrie
to
an
evening
at
the
theatre
with
them
.
She
heard
Carrie
*NL*
say
that
Hurstwood
was
not
coming
home
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
come
with
us
?
Do
n't
get
dinner
for
yourself
.
We
're
going
*NL*
down
to
Sherry
's
for
dinner
and
then
over
to
the
Lyceum
.
Come
along
with
*NL*
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
will
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
dress
at
three
o'clock
for
her
departure
at
half-past
*NL*
five
for
the
noted
dining-room
which
was
then
crowding
Delmonico
's
for
*NL*
position
in
society
.
In
this
dressing
Carrie
showed
the
influence
of
*NL*
her
association
with
the
dashing
Mrs.
Vance
.
She
had
constantly
had
her
*NL*
attention
called
by
the
latter
to
novelties
in
everything
which
pertains
*NL*
to
a
woman
's
apparel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
get
such
and
such
a
hat
?
''
or
,
``
Have
you
seen
the
new
*NL*
gloves
with
the
oval
pearl
buttons
?
''
were
but
sample
phrases
out
of
a
*NL*
large
selection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
time
you
get
a
pair
of
shoes
,
dearie
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
,
``
get
*NL*
button
,
with
thick
soles
and
patent-leather
tips
.
They
're
all
the
rage
*NL*
this
fall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
have
you
seen
the
new
shirtwaists
at
Altman
's
?
They
have
*NL*
some
of
the
loveliest
patterns
.
I
saw
one
there
that
I
know
would
look
*NL*
stunning
on
you
.
I
said
so
when
I
saw
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
listened
to
these
things
with
considerable
interest
,
for
they
*NL*
were
suggested
with
more
of
friendliness
than
is
usually
common
between
*NL*
pretty
women
.
Mrs.
Vance
liked
Carrie
's
stable
good-nature
so
well
that
*NL*
she
really
took
pleasure
in
suggesting
to
her
the
latest
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
get
yourself
one
of
those
nice
serge
skirts
they
're
*NL*
selling
at
Lord
&
Taylor
's
?
''
she
said
one
day
.
``
They
're
the
circular
*NL*
style
,
and
they
're
going
to
be
worn
from
now
on
.
A
dark
blue
one
would
*NL*
look
so
nice
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
listened
with
eager
ears
.
These
things
never
came
up
between
her
*NL*
and
Hurstwood
.
Nevertheless
,
she
began
to
suggest
one
thing
and
another
,
*NL*
which
Hurstwood
agreed
to
without
any
expression
of
opinion
.
He
noticed
*NL*
the
new
tendency
on
Carrie
's
part
,
and
finally
,
hearing
much
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Vance
and
her
delightful
ways
,
suspected
whence
the
change
came
.
He
was
*NL*
not
inclined
to
offer
the
slightest
objection
so
soon
,
but
he
felt
that
*NL*
Carrie
's
wants
were
expanding
.
This
did
not
appeal
to
him
exactly
,
but
*NL*
he
cared
for
her
in
his
own
way
,
and
so
the
thing
stood
.
Still
,
there
*NL*
was
something
in
the
details
of
the
transactions
which
caused
Carrie
*NL*
to
feel
that
her
requests
were
not
a
delight
to
him
.
He
did
not
enthuse
*NL*
over
the
purchases
.
This
led
her
to
believe
that
neglect
was
creeping
*NL*
in
,
and
so
another
small
wedge
was
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
one
of
the
results
of
Mrs.
Vance
's
suggestions
was
the
*NL*
fact
that
on
this
occasion
Carrie
was
dressed
somewhat
to
her
own
*NL*
satisfaction
.
She
had
on
her
best
,
but
there
was
comfort
in
the
thought
*NL*
that
if
she
must
confine
herself
to
a
best
,
it
was
neat
and
fitting
.
She
*NL*
looked
the
well-groomed
woman
of
twenty-one
,
and
Mrs.
Vance
praised
her
,
*NL*
which
brought
colour
to
her
plump
cheeks
and
a
noticeable
brightness
*NL*
into
her
large
eyes
.
It
was
threatening
rain
,
and
Mr.
Vance
,
at
his
*NL*
wife
's
request
,
had
called
a
coach
.
``
Your
husband
is
n't
coming
?
''
*NL*
suggested
Mr.
Vance
,
as
he
met
Carrie
in
his
little
parlour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
he
said
he
would
n't
be
home
for
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
leave
a
little
note
for
him
,
telling
him
where
we
are
.
He
might
*NL*
turn
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
had
not
thought
of
it
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
him
we
'll
be
at
Sherry
's
until
eight
o'clock
.
He
knows
,
though
I
*NL*
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
crossed
the
hall
with
rustling
skirts
,
and
scrawled
the
note
,
*NL*
gloves
on
.
When
she
returned
a
newcomer
was
in
the
Vance
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Wheeler
,
let
me
introduce
Mr.
Ames
,
a
cousin
of
mine
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Vance
.
``
He
's
going
along
with
us
,
are
n't
you
,
Bob
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
glad
to
meet
you
,
''
said
Ames
,
bowing
politely
to
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
caught
in
a
glance
the
dimensions
of
a
very
stalwart
figure
.
*NL*
She
also
noticed
that
he
was
smooth-shaven
,
good
looking
,
and
young
,
but
*NL*
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Ames
is
just
down
in
New
York
for
a
few
days
,
''
put
in
Vance
,
``
and
*NL*
we
're
trying
to
show
him
around
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
are
you
?
''
said
Carrie
,
taking
another
glance
at
the
newcomer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
am
just
on
here
from
Indianapolis
for
a
week
or
so
,
''
said
young
*NL*
Ames
,
seating
himself
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
to
wait
while
Mrs.
Vance
*NL*
completed
the
last
touches
of
her
toilet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
find
New
York
quite
a
thing
to
see
,
do
n't
you
?
''
said
*NL*
Carrie
,
venturing
something
to
avoid
a
possible
deadly
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
rather
large
to
get
around
in
a
week
,
''
answered
Ames
,
pleasantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
an
exceedingly
genial
soul
,
this
young
man
,
and
wholly
free
of
*NL*
affectation
.
It
seemed
to
Carrie
he
was
as
yet
only
overcoming
the
last
*NL*
traces
of
the
bashfulness
of
youth
.
He
did
not
seem
apt
at
conversation
,
*NL*
but
he
had
the
merit
of
being
well
dressed
and
wholly
courageous
.
Carrie
*NL*
felt
as
if
it
were
not
going
to
be
hard
to
talk
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
guess
we
're
ready
now
.
The
coach
is
outside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
people
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
,
coming
in
smiling
.
``
Bob
,
you
'll
have
*NL*
to
look
after
Mrs.
Wheeler
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
to
,
''
said
Bob
smiling
,
and
edging
closer
to
Carrie
.
``
You
wo
n't
*NL*
need
much
watching
,
will
you
?
''
he
volunteered
,
in
a
sort
of
ingratiating
*NL*
and
help-me-out
kind
of
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
,
I
hope
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
descended
the
stairs
,
Mrs.
Vance
offering
suggestions
,
and
climbed
*NL*
into
the
open
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Vance
,
slamming
the
coach
door
,
and
the
conveyance
*NL*
rolled
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
we
're
going
to
see
?
''
asked
Ames
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sothern
,
''
said
Vance
,
``
in
`
Lord
Chumley
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
is
so
good
!
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
.
``
He
's
just
the
funniest
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
notice
the
papers
praise
it
,
''
said
Ames
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
any
doubt
,
''
put
in
Vance
,
``
but
we
'll
all
enjoy
it
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ames
had
taken
a
seat
beside
Carrie
,
and
accordingly
he
felt
it
his
*NL*
bounden
duty
to
pay
her
some
attention
.
He
was
interested
to
find
her
so
*NL*
young
a
wife
,
and
so
pretty
,
though
it
was
only
a
respectful
interest
.
*NL*
There
was
nothing
of
the
dashing
lady
's
man
about
him
.
He
had
respect
*NL*
for
the
married
state
,
and
thought
only
of
some
pretty
marriageable
*NL*
girls
in
Indianapolis
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
born
New
Yorker
?
''
asked
Ames
of
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
I
've
only
been
here
for
two
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
you
've
had
time
to
see
a
great
deal
of
it
,
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
seem
to
have
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
``
It
's
about
as
strange
to
me
as
*NL*
when
I
first
came
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
from
the
West
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
'm
from
Wisconsin
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
does
seem
as
if
most
people
in
this
town
have
n't
been
here
so
*NL*
very
long
.
I
hear
of
lots
of
Indiana
people
in
my
line
who
are
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
line
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
connected
with
an
electrical
company
,
''
said
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
followed
up
this
desultory
conversation
with
occasional
*NL*
interruptions
from
the
Vances
.
Several
times
it
became
general
and
*NL*
partially
humorous
,
and
in
that
manner
the
restaurant
was
reached
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
noticed
the
appearance
of
gayety
and
pleasure-seeking
in
the
*NL*
streets
which
they
were
following
.
Coaches
were
numerous
,
pedestrians
*NL*
many
,
and
in
Fifty-ninth
Street
the
street
cars
were
crowded
.
At
*NL*
Fifty-ninth
Street
and
Fifth
Avenue
a
blaze
of
lights
from
several
new
*NL*
hotels
which
bordered
the
Plaza
Square
gave
a
suggestion
of
sumptuous
*NL*
hotel
life
.
Fifth
Avenue
,
the
home
of
the
wealthy
,
was
noticeably
*NL*
crowded
with
carriages
,
and
gentlemen
in
evening
dress
.
At
Sherry
's
an
*NL*
imposing
doorman
opened
the
coach
door
and
helped
them
out
.
Young
Ames
*NL*
held
Carrie
's
elbow
as
he
helped
her
up
the
steps
.
They
entered
*NL*
the
lobby
already
swarming
with
patrons
,
and
then
,
after
divesting
*NL*
themselves
of
their
wraps
,
went
into
a
sumptuous
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
Carrie
's
experience
she
had
never
seen
anything
like
this
.
In
the
*NL*
whole
time
she
had
been
in
New
York
Hurstwood
's
modified
state
had
*NL*
not
permitted
his
bringing
her
to
such
a
place
.
There
was
an
almost
*NL*
indescribable
atmosphere
about
it
which
convinced
the
newcomer
that
this
*NL*
was
the
proper
thing
.
Here
was
the
place
where
the
matter
of
expense
*NL*
limited
the
patrons
to
the
moneyed
or
pleasure-loving
class
.
Carrie
*NL*
had
read
of
it
often
in
the
``
Morning
''
and
``
Evening
World
.
''
She
had
seen
*NL*
notices
of
dances
,
parties
,
balls
,
and
suppers
at
Sherry
's
.
The
Misses
*NL*
So-and-so
would
give
a
party
on
Wednesday
evening
at
Sherry
's
.
Young
Mr.
*NL*
So-and-So
would
entertain
a
party
of
friends
at
a
private
luncheon
on
*NL*
the
sixteenth
,
at
Sherry
's
.
The
common
run
of
conventional
,
perfunctory
*NL*
notices
of
the
doings
of
society
,
which
she
could
scarcely
refrain
from
*NL*
scanning
each
day
,
had
given
her
a
distinct
idea
of
the
gorgeousness
*NL*
and
luxury
of
this
wonderful
temple
of
gastronomy
.
Now
,
at
last
,
she
was
*NL*
really
in
it
.
She
had
come
up
the
imposing
steps
,
guarded
by
the
large
*NL*
and
portly
doorman
.
She
had
seen
the
lobby
,
guarded
by
another
large
and
*NL*
portly
gentleman
,
and
been
waited
upon
by
uniformed
youths
who
took
care
*NL*
of
canes
,
overcoats
,
and
the
like
.
Here
was
the
splendid
dining-chamber
,
*NL*
all
decorated
and
aglow
,
where
the
wealthy
ate
.
Ah
,
how
fortunate
was
*NL*
Mrs.
Vance
;
young
,
beautiful
,
and
well
off
--
at
least
,
sufficiently
so
to
*NL*
come
here
in
a
coach
.
What
a
wonderful
thing
it
was
to
be
rich
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vance
led
the
way
through
lanes
of
shining
tables
,
at
which
were
seated
*NL*
parties
of
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
,
or
six
.
The
air
of
assurance
and
*NL*
dignity
about
it
all
was
exceedingly
noticeable
to
the
novitiate
.
*NL*
Incandescent
lights
,
the
reflection
of
their
glow
in
polished
glasses
,
*NL*
and
the
shine
of
gilt
upon
the
walls
,
combined
into
one
tone
of
light
*NL*
which
it
requires
minutes
of
complacent
observation
to
separate
and
take
*NL*
particular
note
of
.
The
white
shirt
fronts
of
the
gentlemen
,
the
bright
*NL*
costumes
of
the
ladies
,
diamonds
,
jewels
,
fine
feathers
--
all
were
*NL*
exceedingly
noticeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
walked
with
an
air
equal
to
that
of
Mrs.
Vance
,
and
accepted
the
*NL*
seat
which
the
head
waiter
provided
for
her
.
She
was
keenly
aware
of
*NL*
all
the
little
things
that
were
done
--
the
little
genuflections
and
*NL*
attentions
of
the
waiters
and
head
waiter
which
Americans
pay
for
.
The
*NL*
air
with
which
the
latter
pulled
out
each
chair
,
and
the
wave
of
the
*NL*
hand
with
which
he
motioned
them
to
be
seated
,
were
worth
several
*NL*
dollars
in
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
seated
,
there
began
that
exhibition
of
showy
,
wasteful
,
and
*NL*
unwholesome
gastronomy
as
practised
by
wealthy
Americans
,
which
is
the
*NL*
wonder
and
astonishment
of
true
culture
and
dignity
the
world
over
.
The
*NL*
large
bill
of
fare
held
an
array
of
dishes
sufficient
to
feed
an
army
,
*NL*
sidelined
with
prices
which
made
reasonable
expenditure
a
ridiculous
*NL*
impossibility
--
an
order
of
soup
at
fifty
cents
or
a
dollar
,
with
a
dozen
*NL*
kinds
to
choose
from
;
oysters
in
forty
styles
and
at
sixty
cents
the
*NL*
half-dozen
;
entrees
,
fish
,
and
meats
at
prices
which
would
house
one
*NL*
over
night
in
an
average
hotel
.
One
dollar
fifty
and
two
dollars
seemed
*NL*
to
be
the
most
common
figures
upon
this
most
tastefully
printed
bill
of
*NL*
fare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
noticed
this
,
and
in
scanning
it
the
price
of
spring
chicken
*NL*
carried
her
back
to
that
other
bill
of
fare
and
far
different
occasion
*NL*
when
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
sat
with
Drouet
in
a
good
restaurant
in
*NL*
Chicago
.
It
was
only
momentary
--
a
sad
note
as
out
of
an
old
song
--
and
*NL*
then
it
was
gone
.
But
in
that
flash
was
seen
the
other
Carrie
--
poor
,
*NL*
hungry
,
drifting
at
her
wits
'
ends
,
and
all
Chicago
a
cold
and
closed
*NL*
world
,
from
which
she
only
wandered
because
she
could
not
find
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
walls
were
designs
in
colour
,
square
spots
of
robin
's
-
egg
blue
,
*NL*
set
in
ornate
frames
of
gilt
,
whose
corners
were
elaborate
mouldings
of
*NL*
fruit
and
flowers
,
with
fat
cupids
hovering
in
angelic
comfort
.
On
the
*NL*
ceilings
were
coloured
traceries
with
more
gilt
,
leading
to
a
centre
*NL*
where
spread
a
cluster
of
lights
--
incandescent
globes
mingled
with
*NL*
glittering
prisms
and
stucco
tendrils
of
gilt
.
The
floor
was
of
*NL*
a
reddish
hue
,
waxed
and
polished
,
and
in
every
direction
were
*NL*
mirrors
--
tall
,
brilliant
,
bevel-edged
mirrors
--
reflecting
and
*NL*
re-reflecting
forms
,
faces
,
and
candelabra
a
score
and
a
hundred
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tables
were
not
so
remarkable
in
themselves
,
and
yet
the
imprint
*NL*
of
Sherry
upon
the
napery
,
the
name
of
Tiffany
upon
the
silverware
,
the
*NL*
name
of
Haviland
upon
the
china
,
and
over
all
the
glow
of
the
small
,
*NL*
red-shaded
candelabra
and
the
reflected
tints
of
the
walls
on
garments
*NL*
and
faces
,
made
them
seem
remarkable
.
Each
waiter
added
an
air
of
*NL*
exclusiveness
and
elegance
by
the
manner
in
which
he
bowed
,
scraped
,
*NL*
touched
,
and
trifled
with
things
.
The
exclusively
personal
attention
*NL*
which
he
devoted
to
each
one
,
standing
half
bent
,
ear
to
one
side
,
*NL*
elbows
akimbo
,
saying
:
``
Soup
--
green
turtle
,
yes
.
One
portion
,
yes
.
*NL*
Oysters
--
certainly
--
half-dozen
--
yes
.
Asparagus
.
Olives
--
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
the
same
with
each
one
,
only
Vance
essayed
to
order
for
all
,
*NL*
inviting
counsel
and
suggestions
.
Carrie
studied
the
company
with
open
*NL*
eyes
.
So
this
was
high
life
in
New
York
.
It
was
so
that
the
rich
spent
*NL*
their
days
and
evenings
.
Her
poor
little
mind
could
not
rise
above
*NL*
applying
each
scene
to
all
society
.
Every
fine
lady
must
be
in
the
crowd
*NL*
on
Broadway
in
the
afternoon
,
in
the
theatre
at
the
matinee
,
in
the
*NL*
coaches
and
dining-halls
at
night
.
It
must
be
glow
and
shine
everywhere
,
*NL*
with
coaches
waiting
,
and
footmen
attending
,
and
she
was
out
of
it
all
.
*NL*
In
two
long
years
she
had
never
even
been
in
such
a
place
as
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vance
was
in
his
element
here
,
as
Hurstwood
would
have
been
in
former
*NL*
days
.
He
ordered
freely
of
soup
,
oysters
,
roast
meats
,
and
side
dishes
,
*NL*
and
had
several
bottles
of
wine
brought
,
which
were
set
down
beside
the
*NL*
table
in
a
wicker
basket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ames
was
looking
away
rather
abstractedly
at
the
crowd
and
showed
an
*NL*
interesting
profile
to
Carrie
.
His
forehead
was
high
,
his
nose
rather
*NL*
large
and
strong
,
his
chin
moderately
pleasing
.
He
had
a
good
,
wide
,
*NL*
well-shaped
mouth
,
and
his
dark-brown
hair
was
parted
slightly
on
one
*NL*
side
.
He
seemed
to
have
the
least
touch
of
boyishness
to
Carrie
,
and
yet
*NL*
he
was
a
man
full
grown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
he
said
,
turning
back
to
Carrie
,
after
his
reflection
,
*NL*
``
I
sometimes
think
it
is
a
shame
for
people
to
spend
so
much
money
this
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
a
moment
with
the
faintest
touch
of
surprise
at
his
*NL*
seriousness
.
He
seemed
to
be
thinking
about
something
over
which
she
had
*NL*
never
pondered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
''
she
answered
,
interestedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
they
pay
so
much
more
than
these
things
are
worth
.
They
*NL*
put
on
so
much
show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
why
people
should
n't
spend
when
they
have
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Vance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
do
any
harm
,
''
said
Vance
,
who
was
still
studying
the
bill
of
*NL*
fare
,
though
he
had
ordered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ames
was
looking
away
again
,
and
Carrie
was
again
looking
at
his
*NL*
forehead
.
To
her
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
about
strange
things
.
As
he
*NL*
studied
the
crowd
his
eye
was
mild
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
that
woman
's
dress
over
there
,
''
he
said
,
again
turning
to
*NL*
Carrie
,
and
nodding
in
a
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
said
Carrie
,
following
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Over
there
in
the
corner
--
way
over
.
Do
you
see
that
brooch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
large
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
the
largest
clusters
of
jewels
I
have
ever
seen
,
''
said
Ames
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
Carrie
.
She
felt
as
if
she
would
like
to
be
*NL*
agreeable
to
this
young
man
,
and
also
there
came
with
it
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
preceded
it
,
the
slightest
shade
of
a
feeling
that
he
was
better
*NL*
educated
than
she
was
--
that
his
mind
was
better
.
He
seemed
to
look
it
,
*NL*
and
the
saving
grace
in
Carrie
was
that
she
could
understand
that
people
*NL*
could
be
wiser
.
She
had
seen
a
number
of
people
in
her
life
who
reminded
*NL*
her
of
what
she
had
vaguely
come
to
think
of
as
scholars
.
This
strong
*NL*
young
man
beside
her
,
with
his
clear
,
natural
look
,
seemed
to
get
a
hold
*NL*
of
things
which
she
did
not
quite
understand
,
but
approved
of
.
It
was
*NL*
fine
to
be
so
,
as
a
man
,
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
changed
to
a
book
that
was
having
its
vogue
at
the
*NL*
time
--
``
Moulding
a
Maiden
,
''
by
Albert
Ross
.
Mrs.
Vance
had
read
it
.
Vance
*NL*
had
seen
it
discussed
in
some
of
the
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
can
make
quite
a
strike
writing
a
book
,
''
said
Vance
.
``
I
notice
*NL*
this
fellow
Ross
is
very
much
talked
about
.
''
He
was
looking
at
Carrie
as
*NL*
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
n't
heard
of
him
,
''
said
Carrie
,
honestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
have
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
.
``
He
's
written
lots
of
things
.
This
last
*NL*
story
is
pretty
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
amount
to
much
,
''
said
Ames
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
turned
her
eyes
toward
him
as
to
an
oracle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
stuff
is
nearly
as
bad
as
`
Dora
Thorne
,
'
''
concluded
Ames
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
felt
this
as
a
personal
reproof
.
She
read
``
Dora
Thorne
,
''
or
had
*NL*
a
great
deal
in
the
past
.
It
seemed
only
fair
to
her
,
but
she
supposed
*NL*
that
people
thought
it
very
fine
.
Now
this
clear-eyed
,
fine-headed
*NL*
youth
,
who
looked
something
like
a
student
to
her
,
made
fun
of
it
.
It
*NL*
was
poor
to
him
,
not
worth
reading
.
She
looked
down
,
and
for
the
first
*NL*
time
felt
the
pain
of
not
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
there
was
nothing
sarcastic
or
supercilious
in
the
way
Ames
spoke
.
*NL*
He
had
very
little
of
that
in
him
.
Carrie
felt
that
it
was
just
kindly
*NL*
thought
of
a
high
order
--
the
right
thing
to
think
,
and
wondered
what
*NL*
else
was
right
,
according
to
him
.
He
seemed
to
notice
that
she
listened
*NL*
and
rather
sympathised
with
him
,
and
from
now
on
he
talked
mostly
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
waiter
bowed
and
scraped
about
,
felt
the
dishes
to
see
if
they
*NL*
were
hot
enough
,
brought
spoons
and
forks
,
and
did
all
those
little
*NL*
attentive
things
calculated
to
impress
the
luxury
of
the
situation
*NL*
upon
the
diner
,
Ames
also
leaned
slightly
to
one
side
and
told
her
of
*NL*
Indianapolis
in
an
intelligent
way
.
He
really
had
a
very
bright
mind
,
*NL*
which
was
finding
its
chief
development
in
electrical
knowledge
.
His
*NL*
sympathies
for
other
forms
of
information
,
however
,
and
for
types
of
*NL*
people
,
were
quick
and
warm
.
The
red
glow
on
his
head
gave
it
a
sandy
*NL*
tinge
and
put
a
bright
glint
in
his
eye
.
Carrie
noticed
all
these
things
*NL*
as
he
leaned
toward
her
and
felt
exceedingly
young
.
This
man
was
far
*NL*
ahead
of
her
.
He
seemed
wiser
than
Hurstwood
,
saner
and
brighter
than
*NL*
Drouet
.
He
seemed
innocent
and
clean
,
and
she
thought
that
he
was
*NL*
exceedingly
pleasant
.
She
noticed
,
also
,
that
his
interest
in
her
was
a
*NL*
far-off
one
.
She
was
not
in
his
life
,
nor
any
of
the
things
that
touched
*NL*
his
life
,
and
yet
now
,
as
he
spoke
of
these
things
,
they
appealed
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
care
to
be
rich
,
''
he
told
her
,
as
the
dinner
proceeded
and
*NL*
the
supply
of
food
warmed
up
his
sympathies
;
``
not
rich
enough
to
spend
*NL*
my
money
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
would
n't
you
?
''
said
Carrie
,
the
,
to
her
,
new
attitude
forcing
*NL*
itself
distinctly
upon
her
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
good
would
it
do
?
A
man
does
n't
need
this
sort
of
*NL*
thing
to
be
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
thought
of
this
doubtfully
;
but
,
coming
from
him
,
it
had
weight
*NL*
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
probably
could
be
happy
,
''
she
thought
to
herself
,
``
all
alone
.
He
's
*NL*
so
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Vance
kept
up
a
running
fire
of
interruptions
,
and
these
*NL*
impressive
things
by
Ames
came
at
odd
moments
.
They
were
sufficient
,
*NL*
however
,
for
the
atmosphere
that
went
with
this
youth
impressed
itself
*NL*
upon
Carrie
without
words
.
There
was
something
in
him
,
or
the
world
he
*NL*
moved
in
,
which
appealed
to
her
.
He
reminded
her
of
scenes
she
had
seen
*NL*
on
the
stage
--
the
sorrows
and
sacrifices
that
always
went
with
she
*NL*
knew
not
what
.
He
had
taken
away
some
of
the
bitterness
of
the
contrast
*NL*
between
this
life
and
her
life
,
and
all
by
a
certain
calm
indifference
*NL*
which
concerned
only
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
out
,
he
took
her
arm
and
helped
her
into
the
coach
,
and
*NL*
then
they
were
off
again
,
and
so
to
the
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
acts
Carrie
found
herself
listening
to
him
very
attentively
.
*NL*
He
mentioned
things
in
the
play
which
she
most
approved
of
--
things
which
*NL*
swayed
her
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
it
rather
fine
to
be
an
actor
?
''
she
asked
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
be
a
good
one
.
I
think
the
theatre
a
great
*NL*
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
this
little
approval
set
Carrie
's
heart
bounding
.
Ah
,
if
she
could
*NL*
only
be
an
actress
--
a
good
one
!
This
man
was
wise
--
he
knew
--
and
he
*NL*
approved
of
it
.
If
she
were
a
fine
actress
,
such
men
as
he
would
approve
*NL*
of
her
.
She
felt
that
he
was
good
to
speak
as
he
had
,
although
it
did
*NL*
not
concern
her
at
all
.
She
did
not
know
why
she
felt
this
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
close
of
the
show
it
suddenly
developed
that
he
was
not
going
*NL*
back
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
are
n't
you
?
''
said
Carrie
,
with
an
unwarrantable
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
'm
stopping
right
around
here
in
Thirty-third
*NL*
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
could
not
say
anything
else
,
but
somehow
this
development
shocked
*NL*
her
.
She
had
been
regretting
the
wane
of
a
pleasant
evening
,
but
she
had
*NL*
thought
there
was
a
half-hour
more
.
Oh
,
the
half-hours
,
the
minutes
of
*NL*
the
world
;
what
miseries
and
griefs
are
crowded
into
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
good-bye
with
feigned
indifference
.
What
matter
could
it
make
?
*NL*
Still
,
the
coach
seemed
lorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
into
her
own
flat
she
had
this
to
think
about
.
She
did
not
*NL*
know
whether
she
would
ever
see
this
man
any
more
.
What
difference
could
*NL*
it
make
--
what
difference
could
it
make
?
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
had
returned
,
and
was
already
in
bed
.
His
clothes
were
*NL*
scattered
loosely
about
.
Carrie
came
to
the
door
and
saw
him
,
then
*NL*
retreated
.
She
did
not
want
to
go
in
yet
a
while
.
She
wanted
to
think
.
*NL*
It
was
disagreeable
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Back
in
the
dining-room
she
sat
in
her
chair
and
rocked
.
Her
little
*NL*
hands
were
folded
tightly
as
she
thought
.
Through
a
fog
of
longing
and
*NL*
conflicting
desires
she
was
beginning
to
see
.
Oh
,
ye
legions
of
hope
and
*NL*
pity
--
of
sorrow
and
pain
!
She
was
rocking
,
and
beginning
to
see

Chapter
XXXIII
.
WITHOUT
THE
WALLED
CITY
--
THE
SLOPE
OF
THE
YEARS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
immediate
result
of
this
was
nothing
.
Results
from
such
things
*NL*
are
usually
long
in
growing
.
Morning
brings
a
change
of
feeling
.
The
*NL*
existent
condition
invariably
pleads
for
itself
.
It
is
only
at
odd
*NL*
moments
that
we
get
glimpses
of
the
misery
of
things
.
The
heart
*NL*
understands
when
it
is
confronted
with
contrasts
.
Take
them
away
and
the
*NL*
ache
subsides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
went
on
,
leading
much
this
same
life
for
six
months
thereafter
or
*NL*
more
.
She
did
not
see
Ames
any
more
.
He
called
once
upon
the
Vances
,
but
*NL*
she
only
heard
about
it
through
the
young
wife
.
Then
he
went
West
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
gradual
subsidence
of
whatever
personal
attraction
had
*NL*
existed
.
The
mental
effect
of
the
thing
had
not
gone
,
however
,
and
never
*NL*
would
entirely
.
She
had
an
ideal
to
contrast
men
by
--
particularly
men
*NL*
close
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
this
time
--
a
period
rapidly
approaching
three
*NL*
years
--
Hurstwood
had
been
moving
along
in
an
even
path
.
There
was
no
*NL*
apparent
slope
downward
,
and
distinctly
none
upward
,
so
far
as
the
*NL*
casual
observer
might
have
seen
.
But
psychologically
there
was
a
change
,
*NL*
which
was
marked
enough
to
suggest
the
future
very
distinctly
indeed
.
*NL*
This
was
in
the
mere
matter
of
the
halt
his
career
had
received
when
he
*NL*
departed
from
Chicago
.
A
man
's
fortune
or
material
progress
is
very
much
*NL*
the
same
as
his
bodily
growth
.
Either
he
is
growing
stronger
,
healthier
,
*NL*
wiser
,
as
the
youth
approaching
manhood
,
or
he
is
growing
weaker
,
older
,
*NL*
less
incisive
mentally
,
as
the
man
approaching
old
age
.
There
are
no
*NL*
other
states
.
Frequently
there
is
a
period
between
the
cessation
of
*NL*
youthful
accretion
and
the
setting
in
,
in
the
case
of
the
middle-aged
*NL*
man
,
of
the
tendency
toward
decay
when
the
two
processes
are
almost
*NL*
perfectly
balanced
and
there
is
little
doing
in
either
direction
.
Given
*NL*
time
enough
,
however
,
the
balance
becomes
a
sagging
to
the
grave
side
.
*NL*
Slowly
at
first
,
then
with
a
modest
momentum
,
and
at
last
the
graveward
*NL*
process
is
in
the
full
swing
.
So
it
is
frequently
with
man
's
fortune
.
*NL*
If
its
process
of
accretion
is
never
halted
,
if
the
balancing
stage
is
*NL*
never
reached
,
there
will
be
no
toppling
.
Rich
men
are
,
frequently
,
*NL*
in
these
days
,
saved
from
this
dissolution
of
their
fortune
by
their
*NL*
ability
to
hire
younger
brains
.
These
younger
brains
look
upon
the
*NL*
interests
of
the
fortune
as
their
own
,
and
so
steady
and
direct
its
*NL*
progress
.
If
each
individual
were
left
absolutely
to
the
care
of
his
own
*NL*
interests
,
and
were
given
time
enough
in
which
to
grow
exceedingly
old
,
*NL*
his
fortune
would
pass
as
his
strength
and
will
.
He
and
his
would
be
*NL*
utterly
dissolved
and
scattered
unto
the
four
winds
of
the
heavens
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
see
wherein
the
parallel
changes
.
A
fortune
,
like
a
man
,
is
an
*NL*
organism
which
draws
to
itself
other
minds
and
other
strength
than
that
*NL*
inherent
in
the
founder
.
Beside
the
young
minds
drawn
to
it
by
salaries
,
*NL*
it
becomes
allied
with
young
forces
,
which
make
for
its
existence
*NL*
even
when
the
strength
and
wisdom
of
the
founder
are
fading
.
It
may
be
*NL*
conserved
by
the
growth
of
a
community
or
of
a
state
.
It
may
be
involved
*NL*
in
providing
something
for
which
there
is
a
growing
demand
.
This
removes
*NL*
it
at
once
beyond
the
special
care
of
the
founder
.
It
needs
not
so
much
*NL*
foresight
now
as
direction
.
The
man
wanes
,
the
need
continues
or
grows
,
*NL*
and
the
fortune
,
fallen
into
whose
hands
it
may
,
continues
.
Hence
,
some
*NL*
men
never
recognise
the
turning
in
the
tide
of
their
abilities
.
It
is
*NL*
only
in
chance
cases
,
where
a
fortune
or
a
state
of
success
is
wrested
*NL*
from
them
,
that
the
lack
of
ability
to
do
as
they
did
formerly
becomes
*NL*
apparent
.
Hurstwood
,
set
down
under
new
conditions
,
was
in
a
position
to
*NL*
see
that
he
was
no
longer
young
.
If
he
did
not
,
it
was
due
wholly
to
the
*NL*
fact
that
his
state
was
so
well
balanced
that
an
absolute
change
for
the
*NL*
worse
did
not
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
trained
to
reason
or
introspect
himself
,
he
could
not
analyse
the
*NL*
change
that
was
taking
place
in
his
mind
,
and
hence
his
body
,
but
he
*NL*
felt
the
depression
of
it
.
Constant
comparison
between
his
old
state
and
*NL*
his
new
showed
a
balance
for
the
worse
,
which
produced
a
constant
state
*NL*
of
gloom
or
,
at
least
,
depression
.
Now
,
it
has
been
shown
experimentally
*NL*
that
a
constantly
subdued
frame
of
mind
produces
certain
poisons
in
*NL*
the
blood
,
called
katastates
,
just
as
virtuous
feelings
of
pleasure
*NL*
and
delight
produce
helpful
chemicals
called
anastates
.
The
poisons
*NL*
generated
by
remorse
inveigh
against
the
system
,
and
eventually
produce
*NL*
marked
physical
deterioration
.
To
these
Hurstwood
was
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
time
it
told
upon
his
temper
.
His
eye
no
longer
*NL*
possessed
that
buoyant
,
searching
shrewdness
which
had
characterised
*NL*
it
in
Adams
Street
.
His
step
was
not
as
sharp
and
firm
.
He
was
given
*NL*
to
thinking
,
thinking
,
thinking
.
The
new
friends
he
made
were
not
*NL*
celebrities
.
They
were
of
a
cheaper
,
a
slightly
more
sensual
and
cruder
,
*NL*
grade
.
He
could
not
possibly
take
the
pleasure
in
this
company
that
he
*NL*
had
in
that
of
those
fine
frequenters
of
the
Chicago
resort
.
He
was
left
*NL*
to
brood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
,
exceedingly
slowly
,
his
desire
to
greet
,
conciliate
,
and
make
at
*NL*
home
these
people
who
visited
the
Warren
Street
place
passed
from
him
.
*NL*
More
and
more
slowly
the
significance
of
the
realm
he
had
left
began
to
*NL*
be
clear
.
It
did
not
seem
so
wonderful
to
be
in
it
when
he
was
in
it
.
It
*NL*
had
seemed
very
easy
for
any
one
to
get
up
there
and
have
ample
raiment
*NL*
and
money
to
spend
,
but
now
that
he
was
out
of
it
,
how
far
off
it
*NL*
became
.
He
began
to
see
as
one
sees
a
city
with
a
wall
about
it
.
Men
*NL*
were
posted
at
the
gates
.
You
could
not
get
in
.
Those
inside
did
not
*NL*
care
to
come
out
to
see
who
you
were
.
They
were
so
merry
inside
there
*NL*
that
all
those
outside
were
forgotten
,
and
he
was
on
the
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
day
he
could
read
in
the
evening
papers
of
the
doings
within
this
*NL*
walled
city
.
In
the
notices
of
passengers
for
Europe
he
read
the
names
*NL*
of
eminent
frequenters
of
his
old
resort
.
In
the
theatrical
column
*NL*
appeared
,
from
time
to
time
,
announcements
of
the
latest
successes
of
*NL*
men
he
had
known
.
He
knew
that
they
were
at
their
old
gayeties
.
Pullmans
*NL*
were
hauling
them
to
and
fro
about
the
land
,
papers
were
greeting
them
*NL*
with
interesting
mentions
,
the
elegant
lobbies
of
hotels
and
the
glow
*NL*
of
polished
dining-rooms
were
keeping
them
close
within
the
walled
city
.
*NL*
Men
whom
he
had
known
,
men
whom
he
had
tipped
glasses
with
--
rich
men
,
*NL*
and
he
was
forgotten
!
Who
was
Mr.
Wheeler
?
What
was
the
Warren
Street
*NL*
resort
?
Bah
!
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
thinks
that
such
thoughts
do
not
come
to
so
common
a
type
of
*NL*
mind
--
that
such
feelings
require
a
higher
mental
development
--
I
would
*NL*
urge
for
their
consideration
the
fact
that
it
is
the
higher
mental
*NL*
development
that
does
away
with
such
thoughts
.
It
is
the
higher
mental
*NL*
development
which
induces
philosophy
and
that
fortitude
which
refuses
*NL*
to
dwell
upon
such
things
--
refuses
to
be
made
to
suffer
by
their
*NL*
consideration
.
The
common
type
of
mind
is
exceedingly
keen
on
all
*NL*
matters
which
relate
to
its
physical
welfare
--
exceedingly
keen
.
It
*NL*
is
the
unintellectual
miser
who
sweats
blood
at
the
loss
of
a
hundred
*NL*
dollars
.
It
is
the
Epictetus
who
smiles
when
the
last
vestige
of
*NL*
physical
welfare
is
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
came
,
in
the
third
year
,
when
this
thinking
began
to
produce
*NL*
results
in
the
Warren
Street
place
.
The
tide
of
patronage
dropped
a
*NL*
little
below
what
it
had
been
at
its
best
since
he
had
been
there
.
This
*NL*
irritated
and
worried
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
night
when
he
confessed
to
Carrie
that
the
business
was
not
*NL*
doing
as
well
this
month
as
it
had
the
month
before
.
This
was
in
lieu
of
*NL*
certain
suggestions
she
had
made
concerning
little
things
she
wanted
to
*NL*
buy
.
She
had
not
failed
to
notice
that
he
did
not
seem
to
consult
her
*NL*
about
buying
clothes
for
himself
.
For
the
first
time
,
it
struck
her
as
*NL*
a
ruse
,
or
that
he
said
it
so
that
she
would
not
think
of
asking
for
*NL*
things
.
Her
reply
was
mild
enough
,
but
her
thoughts
were
rebellious
.
He
*NL*
was
not
looking
after
her
at
all
.
She
was
depending
for
her
enjoyment
*NL*
upon
the
Vances
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
latter
announced
that
they
were
going
away
.
It
was
*NL*
approaching
spring
,
and
they
were
going
North
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
to
Carrie
,
``
we
think
we
might
as
well
give
*NL*
up
the
flat
and
store
our
things
.
We
'll
be
gone
for
the
summer
,
and
it
*NL*
would
be
a
useless
expense
.
I
think
we
'll
settle
a
little
farther
down
*NL*
town
when
we
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
heard
this
with
genuine
sorrow
.
She
had
enjoyed
Mrs.
Vance
's
*NL*
companionship
so
much
.
There
was
no
one
else
in
the
house
whom
she
knew
.
*NL*
Again
she
would
be
all
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
gloom
over
the
slight
decrease
in
profits
and
the
departure
*NL*
of
the
Vances
came
together
.
So
Carrie
had
loneliness
and
this
mood
*NL*
of
her
husband
to
enjoy
at
the
same
time
.
It
was
a
grievous
thing
.
She
*NL*
became
restless
and
dissatisfied
,
not
exactly
,
as
she
thought
,
with
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
but
with
life
.
What
was
it
?
A
very
dull
round
indeed
.
What
*NL*
did
she
have
?
Nothing
but
this
narrow
,
little
flat
.
The
Vances
could
*NL*
travel
,
they
could
do
the
things
worth
doing
,
and
here
she
was
.
For
*NL*
what
was
she
made
,
anyhow
?
More
thought
followed
,
and
then
tears
--
tears
*NL*
seemed
justified
,
and
the
only
relief
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
another
period
this
state
continued
,
the
twain
leading
a
rather
*NL*
monotonous
life
,
and
then
there
was
a
slight
change
for
the
worse
.
One
*NL*
evening
,
Hurstwood
,
after
thinking
about
a
way
to
modify
Carrie
's
desire
*NL*
for
clothes
and
the
general
strain
upon
his
ability
to
provide
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
'll
ever
be
able
to
do
much
with
Shaughnessy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
a
slow
,
greedy
`
mick
'
!
He
wo
n't
agree
to
anything
to
improve
*NL*
the
place
,
and
it
wo
n't
ever
pay
without
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
make
him
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
've
tried
.
The
only
thing
I
can
see
,
if
I
want
to
improve
,
is
to
*NL*
get
hold
of
a
place
of
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
I
have
is
tied
up
in
there
just
now
.
If
I
had
a
chance
to
*NL*
save
a
while
I
think
I
could
open
a
place
that
would
give
us
plenty
of
*NL*
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
we
save
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
might
try
it
,
''
he
suggested
.
``
I
've
been
thinking
that
if
we
'd
take
*NL*
a
smaller
flat
down
town
and
live
economically
for
a
year
,
I
would
have
*NL*
enough
,
with
what
I
have
invested
,
to
open
a
good
place
.
Then
we
could
*NL*
arrange
to
live
as
you
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
suit
me
all
right
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
felt
*NL*
badly
to
think
it
had
come
to
this
.
Talk
of
a
smaller
flat
sounded
like
*NL*
poverty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
lots
of
nice
little
flats
down
around
Sixth
Avenue
,
below
*NL*
Fourteenth
Street
.
We
might
get
one
down
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
look
at
them
if
you
say
so
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
could
break
away
from
this
fellow
inside
of
a
year
,
''
said
*NL*
Hurstwood
.
``
Nothing
will
ever
come
of
this
arrangement
as
it
's
going
on
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
look
around
,
''
said
Carrie
,
observing
that
the
proposed
change
*NL*
seemed
to
be
a
serious
thing
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
upshot
of
this
was
that
the
change
was
eventually
effected
;
not
*NL*
without
great
gloom
on
the
part
of
Carrie
.
It
really
affected
her
more
*NL*
seriously
than
anything
that
had
yet
happened
.
She
began
to
look
upon
*NL*
Hurstwood
wholly
as
a
man
,
and
not
as
a
lover
or
husband
.
She
felt
*NL*
thoroughly
bound
to
him
as
a
wife
,
and
that
her
lot
was
cast
with
*NL*
his
,
whatever
it
might
be
;
but
she
began
to
see
that
he
was
gloomy
and
*NL*
taciturn
,
not
a
young
,
strong
,
and
buoyant
man
.
He
looked
a
little
bit
*NL*
old
to
her
about
the
eyes
and
mouth
now
,
and
there
were
other
things
*NL*
which
placed
him
in
his
true
rank
,
so
far
as
her
estimation
was
*NL*
concerned
.
She
began
to
feel
that
she
had
made
a
mistake
.
Incidentally
,
*NL*
she
also
began
to
recall
the
fact
that
he
had
practically
forced
her
to
*NL*
flee
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
flat
was
located
in
Thirteenth
Street
,
a
half
block
west
of
*NL*
Sixth
Avenue
,
and
contained
only
four
rooms
.
The
new
neighbourhood
did
*NL*
not
appeal
to
Carrie
as
much
.
There
were
no
trees
here
,
no
west
view
of
*NL*
the
river
.
The
street
was
solidly
built
up
.
There
were
twelve
families
*NL*
here
,
respectable
enough
,
but
nothing
like
the
Vances
.
Richer
people
*NL*
required
more
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
left
alone
in
this
little
place
,
Carrie
did
without
a
girl
.
She
*NL*
made
it
charming
enough
,
but
could
not
make
it
delight
her
.
Hurstwood
*NL*
was
not
inwardly
pleased
to
think
that
they
should
have
to
modify
their
*NL*
state
,
but
he
argued
that
he
could
do
nothing
.
He
must
put
the
best
face
*NL*
on
it
,
and
let
it
go
at
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
show
Carrie
that
there
was
no
cause
for
financial
alarm
,
but
*NL*
only
congratulation
over
the
chance
he
would
have
at
the
end
of
the
year
*NL*
by
taking
her
rather
more
frequently
to
the
theatre
and
by
providing
a
*NL*
liberal
table
.
This
was
for
the
time
only
.
He
was
getting
in
the
frame
*NL*
of
mind
where
he
wanted
principally
to
be
alone
and
to
be
allowed
to
*NL*
think
.
The
disease
of
brooding
was
beginning
to
claim
him
as
a
victim
.
*NL*
Only
the
newspapers
and
his
own
thoughts
were
worth
while
.
The
delight
*NL*
of
love
had
again
slipped
away
.
It
was
a
case
of
live
,
now
,
making
the
*NL*
best
you
can
out
of
a
very
commonplace
station
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
road
downward
has
but
few
landings
and
level
places
.
The
very
state
*NL*
of
his
mind
,
superinduced
by
his
condition
,
caused
the
breach
to
widen
*NL*
between
him
and
his
partner
.
At
last
that
individual
began
to
wish
that
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
out
of
it
.
It
so
happened
,
however
,
that
a
real
estate
*NL*
deal
on
the
part
of
the
owner
of
the
land
arranged
things
even
more
*NL*
effectually
than
ill-will
could
have
schemed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
that
?
''
said
Shaughnessy
one
morning
to
Hurstwood
,
pointing
*NL*
to
the
real
estate
column
in
a
copy
of
the
``
Herald
,
''
which
he
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
what
is
it
?
''
said
Hurstwood
,
looking
down
the
items
of
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
who
owns
this
ground
has
sold
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
?
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
,
and
there
was
the
notice
.
Mr.
August
Viele
had
yesterday
*NL*
registered
the
transfer
of
the
lot
,
25
x
75
feet
,
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
Warren
and
Hudson
Streets
,
to
J.
F.
Slawson
for
the
sum
of
$
57,000
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
lease
expires
when
?
''
asked
Hurstwood
,
thinking
.
``
Next
February
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
said
Shaughnessy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
say
what
the
new
man
's
going
to
do
with
it
,
''
remarked
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
looking
back
to
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
hear
,
I
guess
,
soon
enough
,
''
said
Shaughnessy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
,
it
did
develop
.
Mr.
Slawson
owned
the
property
adjoining
,
*NL*
and
was
going
to
put
up
a
modern
office
building
.
The
present
one
was
to
*NL*
be
torn
down
.
It
would
take
probably
a
year
and
a
half
to
complete
the
*NL*
other
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
things
developed
by
degrees
,
and
Hurstwood
began
to
ponder
*NL*
over
what
would
become
of
the
saloon
.
One
day
he
spoke
about
it
to
his
*NL*
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
it
would
be
worth
while
to
open
up
somewhere
else
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
be
the
use
?
''
said
Shaughnessy
.
``
We
could
n't
get
another
*NL*
corner
around
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
n't
pay
anywhere
else
,
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
try
it
,
''
said
the
other
.
The
approaching
change
now
took
on
*NL*
a
most
serious
aspect
to
Hurstwood
.
Dissolution
meant
the
loss
of
his
*NL*
thousand
dollars
,
and
he
could
not
save
another
thousand
in
the
time
.
*NL*
He
understood
that
Shaughnessy
was
merely
tired
of
the
arrangement
,
and
*NL*
would
probably
lease
the
new
corner
,
when
completed
,
alone
.
He
began
*NL*
to
worry
about
the
necessity
of
a
new
connection
and
to
see
impending
*NL*
serious
financial
straits
unless
something
turned
up
.
This
left
him
in
*NL*
no
mood
to
enjoy
his
flat
or
Carrie
,
and
consequently
the
depression
*NL*
invaded
that
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
he
took
such
time
as
he
could
to
look
about
,
but
*NL*
opportunities
were
not
numerous
.
More
,
he
had
not
the
same
impressive
*NL*
personality
which
he
had
when
he
first
came
to
New
York
.
Bad
thoughts
*NL*
had
put
a
shade
into
his
eyes
which
did
not
impress
others
favourably
.
*NL*
Neither
had
he
thirteen
hundred
dollars
in
hand
to
talk
with
.
About
*NL*
a
month
later
,
finding
that
he
had
not
made
any
progress
,
Shaughnessy
*NL*
reported
definitely
that
Slawson
would
not
extend
the
lease
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
this
thing
's
got
to
come
to
an
end
,
''
he
said
,
affecting
an
air
*NL*
of
concern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
it
has
,
it
has
,
''
answered
Hurstwood
,
grimly
.
He
would
not
give
*NL*
the
other
a
key
to
his
opinions
,
whatever
they
were
.
He
should
not
have
*NL*
the
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
or
two
later
he
saw
that
he
must
say
something
to
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
think
I
'm
going
to
get
the
worst
of
my
deal
down
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
?
''
asked
Carrie
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
man
who
owns
the
ground
has
sold
it
,
and
the
new
owner
wo
n't
*NL*
release
it
to
us
.
The
business
may
come
to
an
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
start
somewhere
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
does
n't
seem
to
be
any
place
.
Shaughnessy
does
n't
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
lose
what
you
put
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
whose
face
was
a
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
n't
that
too
bad
?
''
said
Carrie
.

That

*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
,
and
gathered
from
his
whole
demeanour
what
it
*NL*
meant
.
It
was
serious
,
very
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
you
can
get
something
else
?
''
she
ventured
,
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
thought
a
while
.
It
was
all
up
with
the
bluff
about
money
and
*NL*
investment
.
She
could
see
now
that
he
was
``
broke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
said
solemnly
;
``
I
can
try

THE
GRIND
OF
THE
MILLSTONES
--
A
SAMPLE
OF
CHAFF
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
pondered
over
this
situation
as
consistently
as
Hurstwood
,
once
*NL*
she
got
the
facts
adjusted
in
her
mind
.
It
took
several
days
for
her
*NL*
to
fully
realise
that
the
approach
of
the
dissolution
of
her
husband
's
*NL*
business
meant
commonplace
struggle
and
privation
.
Her
mind
went
back
to
*NL*
her
early
venture
in
Chicago
,
the
Hansons
and
their
flat
,
and
her
heart
*NL*
revolted
.
That
was
terrible
!
Everything
about
poverty
was
terrible
.
She
*NL*
wished
she
knew
a
way
out
.
Her
recent
experiences
with
the
Vances
had
*NL*
wholly
unfitted
her
to
view
her
own
state
with
complacence
.
The
glamour
*NL*
of
the
high
life
of
the
city
had
,
in
the
few
experiences
afforded
her
by
*NL*
the
former
,
seized
her
completely
.
She
had
been
taught
how
to
dress
*NL*
and
where
to
go
without
having
ample
means
to
do
either
.
Now
,
these
*NL*
things
--
ever-present
realities
as
they
were
--
filled
her
eyes
and
mind
.
*NL*
The
more
circumscribed
became
her
state
,
the
more
entrancing
seemed
this
*NL*
other
.
And
now
poverty
threatened
to
seize
her
entirely
and
to
remove
*NL*
this
other
world
far
upward
like
a
heaven
to
which
any
Lazarus
might
*NL*
extend
,
appealingly
,
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
too
,
the
ideal
brought
into
her
life
by
Ames
remained
.
He
had
gone
,
*NL*
but
here
was
his
word
that
riches
were
not
everything
;
that
there
was
a
*NL*
great
deal
more
in
the
world
than
she
knew
;
that
the
stage
was
good
,
and
*NL*
the
literature
she
read
poor
.
He
was
a
strong
man
and
clean
--
how
much
*NL*
stronger
and
better
than
Hurstwood
and
Drouet
she
only
half
formulated
*NL*
to
herself
,
but
the
difference
was
painful
.
It
was
something
to
which
*NL*
she
voluntarily
closed
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
last
three
months
of
the
Warren
Street
connection
,
Hurstwood
*NL*
took
parts
of
days
off
and
hunted
,
tracking
the
business
advertisements
.
*NL*
It
was
a
more
or
less
depressing
business
,
wholly
because
of
the
thought
*NL*
that
he
must
soon
get
something
or
he
would
begin
to
live
on
the
*NL*
few
hundred
dollars
he
was
saving
,
and
then
he
would
have
nothing
to
*NL*
invest
--
he
would
have
to
hire
out
as
a
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
he
discovered
in
his
line
advertised
as
an
opportunity
,
*NL*
was
either
too
expensive
or
too
wretched
for
him
.
Besides
,
winter
was
*NL*
coming
,
the
papers
were
announcing
hardships
,
and
there
was
a
general
*NL*
feeling
of
hard
times
in
the
air
,
or
,
at
least
,
he
thought
so
.
In
his
*NL*
worry
,
other
people
's
worries
became
apparent
.
No
item
about
a
firm
*NL*
failing
,
a
family
starving
,
or
a
man
dying
upon
the
streets
,
supposedly
*NL*
of
starvation
,
but
arrested
his
eye
as
he
scanned
the
morning
papers
.
*NL*
Once
the
``
World
''
came
out
with
a
flaring
announcement
about
``
80,000
*NL*
people
out
of
employment
in
New
York
this
winter
,
''
which
struck
as
a
*NL*
knife
at
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eighty
thousand
!
''
he
thought
.
``
What
an
awful
thing
that
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
new
reasoning
for
Hurstwood
.
In
the
old
days
the
world
had
*NL*
seemed
to
be
getting
along
well
enough
.
He
had
been
wont
to
see
similar
*NL*
things
in
the
``
Daily
News
,
''
in
Chicago
,
but
they
did
not
hold
his
*NL*
attention
.
Now
,
these
things
were
like
grey
clouds
hovering
along
the
*NL*
horizon
of
a
clear
day
.
They
threatened
to
cover
and
obscure
his
life
*NL*
with
chilly
greyness
.
He
tried
to
shake
them
off
,
to
forget
and
brace
*NL*
up
.
Sometimes
he
said
to
himself
,
mentally
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
worrying
?
I
'm
not
out
yet
.
I
've
got
six
weeks
more
.
Even
*NL*
if
worst
comes
to
worst
,
I
've
got
enough
to
live
on
for
six
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Curiously
,
as
he
troubled
over
his
future
,
his
thoughts
occasionally
*NL*
reverted
to
his
wife
and
family
.
He
had
avoided
such
thoughts
for
the
*NL*
first
three
years
as
much
as
possible
.
He
hated
her
,
and
he
could
get
*NL*
along
without
her
.
Let
her
go
.
He
would
do
well
enough
.
Now
,
however
,
*NL*
when
he
was
not
doing
well
enough
,
he
began
to
wonder
what
she
was
*NL*
doing
,
how
his
children
were
getting
along
.
He
could
see
them
living
as
*NL*
nicely
as
ever
,
occupying
the
comfortable
house
and
using
his
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
George
!
it
's
a
shame
they
should
have
it
all
,
''
he
vaguely
thought
to
*NL*
himself
on
several
occasions
.
``
I
did
n't
do
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
looked
back
now
and
analysed
the
situation
which
led
up
to
his
*NL*
taking
the
money
,
he
began
mildly
to
justify
himself
.
What
had
he
*NL*
done
--
what
in
the
world
--
that
should
bar
him
out
this
way
and
heap
such
*NL*
difficulties
upon
him
?
It
seemed
only
yesterday
to
him
since
he
was
*NL*
comfortable
and
well-to-do
.
But
now
it
was
all
wrested
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
n't
deserve
what
she
got
out
of
me
,
that
is
sure
.
I
did
n't
do
so
*NL*
much
,
if
everybody
could
just
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
thought
that
the
facts
ought
to
be
advertised
.
It
was
only
*NL*
a
mental
justification
he
was
seeking
from
himself
--
something
that
would
*NL*
enable
him
to
bear
his
state
as
a
righteous
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
five
weeks
before
the
Warren
Street
place
closed
up
,
he
*NL*
left
the
saloon
to
visit
three
or
four
places
he
saw
advertised
in
the
*NL*
``
Herald
.
''
One
was
down
in
Gold
Street
,
and
he
visited
that
,
but
did
not
*NL*
enter
.
It
was
such
a
cheap
looking
place
he
felt
that
he
could
not
*NL*
abide
it
.
Another
was
on
the
Bowery
,
which
he
knew
contained
many
showy
*NL*
resorts
.
It
was
near
Grand
Street
,
and
turned
out
to
be
very
handsomely
*NL*
fitted
up
.
He
talked
around
about
investments
for
fully
three-quarters
*NL*
of
an
hour
with
the
proprietor
,
who
maintained
that
his
health
was
poor
,
*NL*
and
that
was
the
reason
he
wished
a
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
just
how
much
money
would
it
take
to
buy
a
half
interest
*NL*
here
?
''
said
Hurstwood
,
who
saw
seven
hundred
dollars
as
his
limit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
thousand
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
jaw
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cash
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
put
on
an
air
of
deliberation
,
as
one
who
might
really
buy
;
*NL*
but
his
eyes
showed
gloom
.
He
wound
up
by
saying
he
would
think
it
over
,
*NL*
and
came
away
.
The
man
he
had
been
talking
to
sensed
his
condition
in
a
*NL*
vague
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
he
wants
to
buy
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
He
does
n't
talk
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
was
as
grey
as
lead
and
cold
.
It
was
blowing
up
a
*NL*
disagreeable
winter
wind
.
He
visited
a
place
far
up
on
the
east
side
,
*NL*
near
Sixty-ninth
Street
,
and
it
was
five
o'clock
,
and
growing
dim
,
when
*NL*
he
reached
there
.
A
portly
German
kept
this
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
this
ad
of
yours
?
''
asked
Hurstwood
,
who
rather
objected
to
*NL*
the
looks
of
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dat
iss
all
over
,
''
said
the
German
.
``
I
vill
not
sell
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
that
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
dere
is
nothing
to
dat
.
It
iss
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
turning
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
German
paid
no
more
attention
to
him
,
and
it
made
him
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
crazy
ass
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
What
does
he
want
to
advertise
*NL*
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Wholly
depressed
,
he
started
for
Thirteenth
Street
.
The
flat
had
only
a
*NL*
light
in
the
kitchen
,
where
Carrie
was
working
.
He
struck
a
match
and
,
*NL*
lighting
the
gas
,
sat
down
in
the
dining-room
without
even
greeting
her
.
*NL*
She
came
to
the
door
and
looked
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
you
,
is
it
?
''
she
said
,
and
went
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
without
even
looking
up
from
the
evening
paper
he
had
*NL*
bought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
saw
things
were
wrong
with
him
.
He
was
not
so
handsome
when
*NL*
gloomy
.
The
lines
at
the
sides
of
the
eyes
were
deepened
.
Naturally
*NL*
dark
of
skin
,
gloom
made
him
look
slightly
sinister
.
He
was
quite
a
*NL*
disagreeable
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
set
the
table
and
brought
in
the
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dinner
's
ready
,
''
she
said
,
passing
him
for
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
,
reading
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
in
and
sat
down
at
her
place
,
feeling
exceedingly
wretched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
eat
now
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
folded
his
paper
and
drew
near
,
silence
holding
for
a
time
,
except
*NL*
for
the
``
Pass
me
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
been
gloomy
to-day
,
has
n't
it
?
''
ventured
Carrie
,
after
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
picked
at
his
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
still
sure
to
close
up
?
''
said
Carrie
,
venturing
to
take
up
the
*NL*
subject
which
they
had
discussed
often
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
we
are
,
''
he
said
,
with
the
slightest
modification
of
*NL*
sharpness
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
retort
angered
Carrie
.
She
had
had
a
dreary
day
of
it
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
talk
like
that
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
pushing
back
from
the
table
,
as
if
to
say
more
,
*NL*
but
letting
it
go
at
that
.
Then
he
picked
up
his
paper
.
Carrie
left
her
*NL*
seat
,
containing
herself
with
difficulty
.
He
saw
she
was
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
`
way
,
''
he
said
,
as
she
started
back
into
the
kitchen
.
``
Eat
*NL*
your
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
,
not
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
paper
a
few
moments
,
and
then
rose
up
and
put
on
his
*NL*
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
downtown
,
Carrie
,
''
he
said
,
coming
out
.
``
I
'm
out
of
sorts
*NL*
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
angry
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
will
be
all
right
to
morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
,
but
she
paid
no
attention
to
him
,
working
at
her
*NL*
dishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
!
''
he
said
finally
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
strong
result
of
the
situation
between
them
,
but
with
*NL*
the
nearing
of
the
last
day
of
the
business
the
gloom
became
almost
*NL*
a
permanent
thing
.
Hurstwood
could
not
conceal
his
feelings
about
the
*NL*
matter
.
Carrie
could
not
help
wondering
where
she
was
drifting
.
It
got
*NL*
so
that
they
talked
even
less
than
usual
,
and
yet
it
was
not
Hurstwood
*NL*
who
felt
any
objection
to
Carrie
.
It
was
Carrie
who
shied
away
from
him
.
*NL*
This
he
noticed
.
It
aroused
an
objection
to
her
becoming
indifferent
*NL*
to
him
.
He
made
the
possibility
of
friendly
intercourse
almost
a
giant
*NL*
task
,
and
then
noticed
with
discontent
that
Carrie
added
to
it
by
her
*NL*
manner
and
made
it
more
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
final
day
came
.
When
it
actually
arrived
,
Hurstwood
,
who
*NL*
had
got
his
mind
into
such
a
state
where
a
thunderclap
and
raging
storm
*NL*
would
have
seemed
highly
appropriate
,
was
rather
relieved
to
find
*NL*
that
it
was
a
plain
,
ordinary
day
.
The
sun
shone
,
the
temperature
was
*NL*
pleasant
.
He
felt
,
as
he
came
to
the
breakfast
table
,
that
it
was
n't
so
*NL*
terrible
,
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
to
Carrie
,
``
to-day
's
my
last
day
on
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
smiled
in
answer
to
his
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
glanced
over
his
paper
rather
gayly
.
He
seemed
to
have
lost
a
*NL*
load
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
down
for
a
little
while
,
''
he
said
after
breakfast
,
``
and
then
*NL*
I
'll
look
around
.
To-morrow
I
'll
spend
the
whole
day
looking
about
.
I
*NL*
think
I
can
get
something
,
now
this
thing
's
off
my
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
smiling
and
visited
the
place
.
Shaughnessy
was
there
.
They
*NL*
had
made
all
arrangements
to
share
according
to
their
interests
.
When
,
*NL*
however
,
he
had
been
there
several
hours
,
gone
out
three
more
,
and
*NL*
returned
,
his
elation
had
departed
.
As
much
as
he
had
objected
to
the
*NL*
place
,
now
that
it
was
no
longer
to
exist
,
he
felt
sorry
.
He
wished
that
*NL*
things
were
different
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shaughnessy
was
coolly
businesslike
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
at
five
o'clock
,
``
we
might
as
well
count
the
change
and
*NL*
divide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
so
.
The
fixtures
had
already
been
sold
and
the
sum
divided
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
said
Hurstwood
at
the
final
moment
,
in
a
last
effort
to
be
*NL*
genial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
,
''
said
Shaughnessy
,
scarcely
deigning
a
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
Warren
Street
arrangement
was
permanently
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
prepared
a
good
dinner
at
the
flat
,
but
after
his
ride
up
,
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
in
a
solemn
and
reflective
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Carrie
,
inquisitively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
out
of
that
,
''
he
answered
,
taking
off
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
looked
at
him
,
she
wondered
what
his
financial
state
was
now
.
*NL*
They
ate
and
talked
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
have
enough
to
buy
in
anywhere
else
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
have
to
get
something
else
and
save
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
nice
if
you
could
get
some
place
,
''
said
Carrie
,
prompted
by
*NL*
anxiety
and
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
I
will
,
''
he
said
reflectively
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
days
thereafter
he
put
on
his
overcoat
regularly
in
the
morning
*NL*
and
sallied
forth
.
On
these
ventures
he
first
consoled
himself
with
the
*NL*
thought
that
with
the
seven
hundred
dollars
he
had
he
could
still
make
*NL*
some
advantageous
arrangement
.
He
thought
about
going
to
some
brewery
,
*NL*
which
,
as
he
knew
,
frequently
controlled
saloons
which
they
leased
,
and
*NL*
get
them
to
help
him
.
Then
he
remembered
that
he
would
have
to
pay
out
*NL*
several
hundred
any
way
for
fixtures
and
that
he
would
have
nothing
left
*NL*
for
his
monthly
expenses
.
It
was
costing
him
nearly
eighty
dollars
a
*NL*
month
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
,
in
his
sanest
moments
,
``
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
I
'll
get
something
*NL*
else
and
save
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
getting-something
proposition
complicated
itself
the
moment
he
*NL*
began
to
think
of
what
it
was
he
wanted
to
do
.
Manage
a
place
?
Where
*NL*
should
he
get
such
a
position
?
The
papers
contained
no
requests
for
*NL*
managers
.
Such
positions
,
he
knew
well
enough
,
were
either
secured
by
*NL*
long
years
of
service
or
were
bought
with
a
half
or
third
interest
.
Into
*NL*
a
place
important
enough
to
need
such
a
manager
he
had
not
money
enough
*NL*
to
buy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
started
out
.
His
clothes
were
very
good
and
his
*NL*
appearance
still
excellent
,
but
it
involved
the
trouble
of
deluding
.
*NL*
People
,
looking
at
him
,
imagined
instantly
that
a
man
of
his
age
,
stout
*NL*
and
well
dressed
,
must
be
well
off
.
He
appeared
a
comfortable
owner
of
*NL*
something
,
a
man
from
whom
the
common
run
of
mortals
could
well
expect
*NL*
gratuities
.
Being
now
forty-three
years
of
age
,
and
comfortably
built
,
*NL*
walking
was
not
easy
.
He
had
not
been
used
to
exercise
for
many
years
.
*NL*
His
legs
tired
,
his
shoulders
ached
,
and
his
feet
pained
him
at
*NL*
the
close
of
the
day
,
even
when
he
took
street
cars
in
almost
every
*NL*
direction
.
The
mere
getting
up
and
down
,
if
long
continued
,
produced
*NL*
this
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
that
people
took
him
to
be
better
off
than
he
was
,
he
well
*NL*
understood
.
It
was
so
painfully
clear
to
him
that
it
retarded
his
*NL*
search
.
Not
that
he
wished
to
be
less
well-appearing
,
but
that
he
was
*NL*
ashamed
to
belie
his
appearance
by
incongruous
appeals
.
So
he
hesitated
,
*NL*
wondering
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
the
hotels
,
but
instantly
he
remembered
that
he
had
had
no
*NL*
experience
as
a
clerk
,
and
,
what
was
more
important
,
no
acquaintances
or
*NL*
friends
in
that
line
to
whom
he
could
go
.
He
did
know
some
hotel
owners
*NL*
in
several
cities
,
including
New
York
,
but
they
knew
of
his
dealings
*NL*
with
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
.
He
could
not
apply
to
them
.
He
thought
of
*NL*
other
lines
suggested
by
large
buildings
or
businesses
which
he
knew
*NL*
of
--
wholesale
groceries
,
hardware
,
insurance
concerns
,
and
the
like
--
but
*NL*
he
had
had
no
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
to
go
about
getting
anything
was
a
bitter
thought
.
Would
he
have
*NL*
to
go
personally
and
ask
;
wait
outside
an
office
door
,
and
,
then
,
*NL*
distinguished
and
affluent
looking
,
announce
that
he
was
looking
for
*NL*
something
to
do
?
He
strained
painfully
at
the
thought
.
No
,
he
could
not
*NL*
do
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
really
strolled
about
,
thinking
,
and
then
,
the
weather
being
cold
,
*NL*
stepped
into
a
hotel
.
He
knew
hotels
well
enough
to
know
that
any
decent
*NL*
individual
was
welcome
to
a
chair
in
the
lobby
.
This
was
in
the
Broadway
*NL*
Central
,
which
was
then
one
of
the
most
important
hotels
in
the
city
.
*NL*
Taking
a
chair
here
was
a
painful
thing
to
him
.
To
think
he
should
come
*NL*
to
this
!
He
had
heard
loungers
about
hotels
called
chairwarmers
.
He
*NL*
had
called
them
that
himself
in
his
day
.
But
here
he
was
,
despite
the
*NL*
possibility
of
meeting
some
one
who
knew
him
,
shielding
himself
from
*NL*
cold
and
the
weariness
of
the
streets
in
a
hotel
lobby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
do
this
way
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
There
's
no
use
of
my
*NL*
starting
out
mornings
without
first
thinking
up
some
place
to
go
.
I
'll
*NL*
think
of
some
places
and
then
look
them
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
occurred
to
him
that
the
positions
of
bartenders
were
sometimes
open
,
*NL*
but
he
put
this
out
of
his
mind
.
Bartender
--
he
,
the
ex-manager
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
grew
awfully
dull
sitting
in
the
hotel
lobby
,
and
so
at
four
he
went
*NL*
home
.
He
tried
to
put
on
a
business
air
as
he
went
in
,
but
it
was
a
*NL*
feeble
imitation
.
The
rocking
chair
in
the
dining-room
was
comfortable
.
*NL*
He
sank
into
it
gladly
,
with
several
papers
he
had
bought
,
and
began
to
*NL*
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
going
through
the
room
to
begin
preparing
dinner
,
Carrie
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
was
here
for
the
rent
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
was
he
?
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
least
wrinkle
crept
into
his
brow
as
he
remembered
that
this
was
*NL*
February
2d
,
the
time
the
man
always
called
.
He
fished
down
in
his
*NL*
pocket
for
his
purse
,
getting
the
first
taste
of
paying
out
when
nothing
*NL*
is
coming
in
.
He
looked
at
the
fat
,
green
roll
as
a
sick
man
looks
at
*NL*
the
one
possible
saving
cure
.
Then
he
counted
off
twenty-eight
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
''
he
said
to
Carrie
,
when
she
came
through
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
buried
himself
in
his
papers
and
read
.
Oh
,
the
rest
of
it
--
the
relief
*NL*
from
walking
and
thinking
!
What
Lethean
waters
were
these
floods
of
*NL*
telegraphed
intelligence
!
He
forgot
his
troubles
,
in
part
.
Here
was
a
*NL*
young
,
handsome
woman
,
if
you
might
believe
the
newspaper
drawing
,
suing
*NL*
a
rich
,
fat
,
candy-making
husband
in
Brooklyn
for
divorce
.
Here
was
*NL*
another
item
detailing
the
wrecking
of
a
vessel
in
ice
and
snow
off
*NL*
Prince
's
Bay
on
Staten
Island
.
A
long
,
bright
column
told
of
the
doings
*NL*
in
the
theatrical
world
--
the
plays
produced
,
the
actors
appearing
,
the
*NL*
managers
making
announcements
.
Fannie
Davenport
was
just
opening
at
*NL*
the
Fifth
Avenue
.
Daly
was
producing
``
King
Lear
.
''
He
read
of
the
early
*NL*
departure
for
the
season
of
a
party
composed
of
the
Vanderbilts
and
*NL*
their
friends
for
Florida
.
An
interesting
shooting
affray
was
on
in
the
*NL*
mountains
of
Kentucky
.
So
he
read
,
read
,
read
,
rocking
in
the
warm
room
*NL*
near
the
radiator
and
waiting
for
dinner
to
be
served
.

Chapter
XXXV
.
THE
PASSING
OF
EFFORT
--
THE
VISAGE
OF
CARE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
he
looked
over
the
papers
and
waded
through
a
long
*NL*
list
of
advertisements
,
making
a
few
notes
.
Then
he
turned
to
the
*NL*
male-help-wanted
column
,
but
with
disagreeable
feelings
.
The
day
was
*NL*
before
him
--
a
long
day
in
which
to
discover
something
--
and
this
was
*NL*
how
he
must
begin
to
discover
.
He
scanned
the
long
column
,
which
mostly
*NL*
concerned
bakers
,
bushelmen
,
cooks
,
compositors
,
drivers
,
and
the
like
,
*NL*
finding
two
things
only
which
arrested
his
eye
.
One
was
a
cashier
wanted
*NL*
in
a
wholesale
furniture
house
,
and
the
other
a
salesman
for
a
whiskey
*NL*
house
.
He
had
never
thought
of
the
latter
.
At
once
he
decided
to
look
*NL*
that
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
firm
in
question
was
Alsbery
&
Co.
,
whiskey
brokers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
admitted
almost
at
once
to
the
manager
on
his
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morning
,
sir
,
''
said
the
latter
,
thinking
at
first
that
he
was
*NL*
encountering
one
of
his
out-of-town
customers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morning
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
You
advertised
,
I
believe
,
for
a
*NL*
salesman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
the
man
,
showing
plainly
the
enlightenment
which
had
come
to
*NL*
him
.
``
Yes
.
Yes
,
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
'd
drop
in
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
with
dignity
.
``
I
've
had
some
*NL*
experience
in
that
line
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
have
you
?
''
said
the
man
.
``
What
experience
have
you
had
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
managed
several
liquor
houses
in
my
time
.
Recently
I
owned
a
*NL*
third-interest
in
a
saloon
at
Warren
and
Hudson
streets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
ceased
,
waiting
for
some
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
want
a
salesman
,
''
said
the
man
.
``
I
do
n't
know
as
it
's
anything
*NL*
you
'd
care
to
take
hold
of
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
Well
,
I
'm
in
no
position
to
choose
,
just
at
*NL*
present
.
If
it
were
open
,
I
should
be
glad
to
get
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
did
not
take
kindly
at
all
to
his
``
No
position
to
choose
.
''
He
*NL*
wanted
some
one
who
was
n't
thinking
of
a
choice
or
something
better
.
*NL*
Especially
not
an
old
man
.
He
wanted
some
one
young
,
active
,
and
glad
to
*NL*
work
actively
for
a
moderate
sum
.
Hurstwood
did
not
please
him
at
all
.
*NL*
He
had
more
of
an
air
than
his
employers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
in
answer
,
``
we
'd
be
glad
to
consider
your
application
.
*NL*
We
sha
n't
decide
for
a
few
days
yet
.
Suppose
you
send
us
your
*NL*
references
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
good-morning
and
came
away
.
At
the
corner
he
looked
at
the
*NL*
furniture
company
's
address
,
and
saw
that
it
was
in
West
Twenty-third
*NL*
Street
.
Accordingly
,
he
went
up
there
.
The
place
was
not
large
enough
,
*NL*
however
.
It
looked
moderate
,
the
men
in
it
idle
and
small
salaried
.
He
*NL*
walked
by
,
glancing
in
,
and
then
decided
not
to
go
in
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
want
a
girl
,
probably
,
at
ten
a
week
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
o'clock
he
thought
of
eating
,
and
went
to
a
restaurant
in
Madison
*NL*
Square
.
There
he
pondered
over
places
which
he
might
look
up
.
He
was
*NL*
tired
.
It
was
blowing
up
grey
again
.
Across
the
way
,
through
Madison
*NL*
Square
Park
,
stood
the
great
hotels
,
looking
down
upon
a
busy
scene
.
He
*NL*
decided
to
go
over
to
the
lobby
of
one
and
sit
a
while
.
It
was
warm
in
*NL*
there
and
bright
.
He
had
seen
no
one
he
knew
at
the
Broadway
Central
.
In
*NL*
all
likelihood
he
would
encounter
no
one
here
.
Finding
a
seat
on
one
*NL*
of
the
red
plush
divans
close
to
the
great
windows
which
look
out
on
*NL*
Broadway
's
busy
rout
,
he
sat
musing
.
His
state
did
not
seem
so
bad
*NL*
in
here
.
Sitting
still
and
looking
out
,
he
could
take
some
slight
*NL*
consolation
in
the
few
hundred
dollars
he
had
in
his
purse
.
He
could
*NL*
forget
,
in
a
measure
,
the
weariness
of
the
street
and
his
tiresome
*NL*
searches
.
Still
,
it
was
only
escape
from
a
severe
to
a
less
severe
*NL*
state
.
He
was
still
gloomy
and
disheartened
.
There
,
minutes
seemed
to
go
*NL*
very
slowly
.
An
hour
was
a
long
,
long
time
in
passing
.
It
was
filled
for
*NL*
him
with
observations
and
mental
comments
concerning
the
actual
*NL*
guests
of
the
hotel
,
who
passed
in
and
out
,
and
those
more
prosperous
*NL*
pedestrians
whose
good
fortune
showed
in
their
clothes
and
spirits
as
*NL*
they
passed
along
Broadway
,
outside
.
It
was
nearly
the
first
time
*NL*
since
he
had
arrived
in
the
city
that
his
leisure
afforded
him
ample
*NL*
opportunity
to
contemplate
this
spectacle
.
Now
,
being
,
perforce
,
idle
*NL*
himself
,
he
wondered
at
the
activity
of
others
.
How
gay
were
the
youths
*NL*
he
saw
,
how
pretty
the
women
.
Such
fine
clothes
they
all
wore
.
They
*NL*
were
so
intent
upon
getting
somewhere
.
He
saw
coquettish
glances
cast
*NL*
by
magnificent
girls
.
Ah
,
the
money
it
required
to
train
with
such
--
how
*NL*
well
he
knew
!
How
long
it
had
been
since
he
had
had
the
opportunity
to
*NL*
do
so
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
outside
registered
four
.
It
was
a
little
early
,
but
he
thought
*NL*
he
would
go
back
to
the
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
going
back
to
the
flat
was
coupled
with
the
thought
that
Carrie
*NL*
would
think
he
was
sitting
around
too
much
if
he
came
home
early
.
He
*NL*
hoped
he
would
n't
have
to
,
but
the
day
hung
heavily
on
his
hands
.
Over
*NL*
there
he
was
on
his
own
ground
.
He
could
sit
in
his
rocking-chair
and
*NL*
read
.
This
busy
,
distracting
,
suggestive
scene
was
shut
out
.
He
could
*NL*
read
his
papers
.
Accordingly
,
he
went
home
.
Carrie
was
reading
,
quite
*NL*
alone
.
It
was
rather
dark
in
the
flat
,
shut
in
as
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
hurt
your
eyes
,
''
he
said
when
he
saw
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
taking
off
his
coat
,
he
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
make
some
*NL*
little
report
of
his
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
talking
with
a
wholesale
liquor
company
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
may
go
*NL*
on
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
that
be
nice
!
''
said
Carrie
.
``
It
would
n't
be
such
a
bad
thing
,
''
*NL*
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Always
from
the
man
at
the
corner
now
he
bought
two
papers
--
the
``
Evening
*NL*
World
''
and
``
Evening
Sun
.
''
So
now
he
merely
picked
his
papers
up
,
as
he
*NL*
came
by
,
without
stopping
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
up
his
chair
near
the
radiator
and
lighted
the
gas
.
Then
it
was
*NL*
as
the
evening
before
.
His
difficulties
vanished
in
the
items
he
so
well
*NL*
loved
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
even
worse
than
the
one
before
,
because
now
he
could
*NL*
not
think
of
where
to
go
.
Nothing
he
saw
in
the
papers
he
studied
--
till
*NL*
ten
o'clock
--
appealed
to
him
.
He
felt
that
he
ought
to
go
out
,
and
yet
*NL*
he
sickened
at
the
thought
.
Where
to
,
where
to
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
forget
to
leave
me
my
money
for
this
week
,
''
said
Carrie
,
*NL*
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
an
arrangement
by
which
he
placed
twelve
dollars
a
week
in
her
*NL*
hands
,
out
of
which
to
pay
current
expenses
.
He
heaved
a
little
sigh
as
*NL*
she
said
this
,
and
drew
out
his
purse
.
Again
he
felt
the
dread
of
the
*NL*
thing
.
Here
he
was
taking
off
,
taking
off
,
and
nothing
coming
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
!
''
he
said
,
in
his
own
thoughts
,
``
this
ca
n't
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Carrie
he
said
nothing
whatsoever
.
She
could
feel
that
her
request
*NL*
disturbed
him
.
To
pay
her
would
soon
become
a
distressing
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
,
what
have
I
got
to
do
with
it
?
''
she
thought
.
``
Oh
,
why
should
I
be
*NL*
made
to
worry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
went
out
and
made
for
Broadway
.
He
wanted
to
think
up
some
*NL*
place
.
Before
long
,
though
,
he
reached
the
Grand
Hotel
at
Thirty-first
*NL*
Street
.
He
knew
of
its
comfortable
lobby
.
He
was
cold
after
his
twenty
*NL*
blocks
'
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
in
their
barber
shop
and
get
a
shave
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
justified
himself
in
sitting
down
in
here
after
his
tonsorial
*NL*
treatment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
time
hanging
heavily
on
his
hands
,
he
went
home
early
,
and
this
*NL*
continued
for
several
days
,
each
day
the
need
to
hunt
paining
him
,
and
*NL*
each
day
disgust
,
depression
,
shamefacedness
driving
him
into
lobby
*NL*
idleness
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
three
days
came
in
which
a
storm
prevailed
,
and
he
did
not
go
*NL*
out
at
all
.
The
snow
began
to
fall
late
one
afternoon
.
It
was
a
regular
*NL*
flurry
of
large
,
soft
,
white
flakes
.
In
the
morning
it
was
still
coming
*NL*
down
with
a
high
wind
,
and
the
papers
announced
a
blizzard
.
From
out
the
*NL*
front
windows
one
could
see
a
deep
,
soft
bedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
I
'll
not
try
to
go
out
to-day
,
''
he
said
to
Carrie
at
breakfast
.
*NL*
``
It
's
going
to
be
awful
bad
,
so
the
papers
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
has
n't
brought
my
coal
,
either
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
ordered
by
*NL*
the
bushel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
over
and
see
about
it
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
This
was
the
first
time
*NL*
he
had
ever
suggested
doing
an
errand
,
but
,
somehow
,
the
wish
to
sit
*NL*
about
the
house
prompted
it
as
a
sort
of
compensation
for
the
privilege
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
and
all
night
it
snowed
,
and
the
city
began
to
suffer
from
a
*NL*
general
blockade
of
traffic
.
Great
attention
was
given
to
the
details
of
*NL*
the
storm
by
the
newspapers
,
which
played
up
the
distress
of
the
poor
in
*NL*
large
type
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
sat
and
read
by
his
radiator
in
the
corner
.
He
did
not
try
to
*NL*
think
about
his
need
of
work
.
This
storm
being
so
terrific
,
and
tying
up
*NL*
all
things
,
robbed
him
of
the
need
.
He
made
himself
wholly
comfortable
*NL*
and
toasted
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
observed
his
ease
with
some
misgiving
.
For
all
the
fury
of
*NL*
the
storm
she
doubted
his
comfort
.
He
took
his
situation
too
*NL*
philosophically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
however
,
read
on
and
on
.
He
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
*NL*
Carrie
.
She
fulfilled
her
household
duties
and
said
little
to
disturb
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
it
was
still
snowing
,
and
the
next
,
bitter
cold
.
Hurstwood
*NL*
took
the
alarm
of
the
paper
and
sat
still
.
Now
he
volunteered
to
do
a
*NL*
few
other
little
things
.
One
was
to
go
to
the
butcher
,
another
to
*NL*
the
grocery
.
He
really
thought
nothing
of
these
little
services
in
*NL*
connection
with
their
true
significance
.
He
felt
as
if
he
were
not
*NL*
wholly
useless
--
indeed
,
in
such
a
stress
of
weather
,
quite
worth
while
*NL*
about
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
fourth
day
,
however
,
it
cleared
,
and
he
read
that
the
storm
was
*NL*
over
.
Now
,
however
,
he
idled
,
thinking
how
sloppy
the
streets
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
noon
before
he
finally
abandoned
his
papers
and
got
under
way
.
*NL*
Owing
to
the
slightly
warmer
temperature
the
streets
were
bad
.
He
*NL*
went
across
Fourteenth
Street
on
the
car
and
got
a
transfer
south
on
*NL*
Broadway
.
One
little
advertisement
he
had
,
relating
to
a
saloon
down
in
*NL*
Pearl
Street
.
When
he
reached
the
Broadway
Central
,
however
,
he
changed
*NL*
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
?
''
he
thought
,
looking
out
upon
the
slop
and
snow
.
``
I
*NL*
could
n't
buy
into
it
.
It
's
a
thousand
to
one
nothing
comes
of
it
.
I
*NL*
guess
I
'll
get
off
,
''
and
off
he
got
.
In
the
lobby
he
took
a
seat
and
*NL*
waited
again
,
wondering
what
he
could
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
idly
pondering
,
satisfied
to
be
inside
,
a
well-dressed
*NL*
man
passed
up
the
lobby
,
stopped
,
looked
sharply
,
as
if
not
sure
of
his
*NL*
memory
,
and
then
approached
.
Hurstwood
recognised
Cargill
,
the
owner
of
*NL*
the
large
stables
in
Chicago
of
the
same
name
,
whom
he
had
last
seen
at
*NL*
Avery
Hall
,
the
night
Carrie
appeared
there
.
The
remembrance
of
how
this
*NL*
individual
brought
up
his
wife
to
shake
hands
on
that
occasion
was
also
*NL*
on
the
instant
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
greatly
abashed
.
His
eyes
expressed
the
difficulty
he
*NL*
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
Hurstwood
!
''
said
Cargill
,
remembering
now
,
and
sorry
that
he
*NL*
had
not
recognised
him
quickly
enough
in
the
beginning
to
have
avoided
*NL*
this
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
How
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Cargill
,
troubled
for
something
to
talk
about
.
*NL*
``
Stopping
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
``
just
keeping
an
appointment
.
''
``
I
knew
you
had
*NL*
left
Chicago
.
I
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
here
now
,
''
answered
Hurstwood
,
anxious
to
get
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doing
well
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
to
hear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
at
one
another
,
rather
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
an
engagement
with
a
friend
upstairs
.
I
'll
leave
you
.
So
*NL*
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
nodded
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
all
,
''
he
murmured
,
turning
toward
the
door
.
``
I
knew
that
would
*NL*
happen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
several
blocks
up
the
street
.
His
watch
only
registered
1.30
.
*NL*
He
tried
to
think
of
some
place
to
go
or
something
to
do
.
The
day
was
so
*NL*
bad
he
wanted
only
to
be
inside
.
Finally
his
feet
began
to
feel
wet
and
*NL*
cold
,
and
he
boarded
a
car
.
This
took
him
to
Fifty-ninth
Street
,
which
*NL*
was
as
good
as
anywhere
else
.
Landed
here
,
he
turned
to
walk
back
along
*NL*
Seventh
Avenue
,
but
the
slush
was
too
much
.
The
misery
of
lounging
about
*NL*
with
nowhere
to
go
became
intolerable
.
He
felt
as
if
he
were
catching
*NL*
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stopping
at
a
corner
,
he
waited
for
a
car
south
bound
.
This
was
no
day
*NL*
to
be
out
;
he
would
go
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
surprised
to
see
him
at
a
quarter
of
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
miserable
day
out
,
''
was
all
he
said
.
Then
he
took
off
his
coat
*NL*
and
changed
his
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
he
felt
a
cold
coming
on
and
took
quinine
.
He
was
feverish
*NL*
until
morning
,
and
sat
about
the
next
day
while
Carrie
waited
on
him
.
*NL*
He
was
a
helpless
creature
in
sickness
,
not
very
handsome
in
a
*NL*
dull-coloured
bath
gown
and
his
hair
uncombed
.
He
looked
haggard
about
*NL*
the
eyes
and
quite
old
.
Carrie
noticed
this
,
and
it
did
not
appeal
to
*NL*
her
.
She
wanted
to
be
good-natured
and
sympathetic
,
but
something
about
*NL*
the
man
held
her
aloof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
evening
he
looked
so
badly
in
the
weak
light
that
she
suggested
*NL*
he
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
sleep
alone
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
'll
feel
better
.
I
'll
open
*NL*
your
bed
for
you
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
did
all
these
things
,
she
was
in
a
most
despondent
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
life
!
What
a
life
!
''
was
her
one
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
during
the
day
,
when
he
sat
near
the
radiator
,
hunched
up
and
*NL*
reading
,
she
passed
through
,
and
seeing
him
,
wrinkled
her
brows
.
In
the
*NL*
front
room
,
where
it
was
not
so
warm
,
she
sat
by
the
window
and
cried
.
*NL*
This
was
the
life
cut
out
for
her
,
was
it
?
To
live
cooped
up
in
a
small
*NL*
flat
with
some
one
who
was
out
of
work
,
idle
,
and
indifferent
to
her
.
*NL*
She
was
merely
a
servant
to
him
now
,
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
crying
made
her
eyes
red
,
and
when
,
in
preparing
his
bed
,
she
*NL*
lighted
the
gas
,
and
,
having
prepared
it
,
called
him
in
,
he
noticed
the
*NL*
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
he
asked
,
looking
into
her
face
.
His
voice
*NL*
was
hoarse
and
his
unkempt
head
only
added
to
its
grewsome
quality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
Carrie
,
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
crying
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
,
either
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
for
love
of
him
,
that
he
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
cry
,
''
he
said
,
getting
into
bed
.
``
Things
will
come
out
all
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
day
or
two
he
was
up
again
,
but
rough
weather
holding
,
he
stayed
*NL*
in
.
The
Italian
newsdealer
now
delivered
the
morning
papers
,
and
these
*NL*
he
read
assiduously
.
A
few
times
after
that
he
ventured
out
,
but
meeting
*NL*
another
of
his
old-time
friends
,
he
began
to
feel
uneasy
sitting
about
*NL*
hotel
corridors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
he
came
home
early
,
and
at
last
made
no
pretence
of
going
*NL*
anywhere
.
Winter
was
no
time
to
look
for
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Naturally
,
being
about
the
house
,
he
noticed
the
way
Carrie
did
things
.
*NL*
She
was
far
from
perfect
in
household
methods
and
economy
,
and
her
*NL*
little
deviations
on
this
score
first
caught
his
eye
.
Not
,
however
,
*NL*
before
her
regular
demand
for
her
allowance
became
a
grievous
thing
.
*NL*
Sitting
around
as
he
did
,
the
weeks
seemed
to
pass
very
quickly
.
Every
*NL*
Tuesday
Carrie
asked
for
her
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
we
live
as
cheaply
as
we
might
?
''
he
asked
one
Tuesday
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
the
best
I
can
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
was
added
to
this
at
the
moment
,
but
the
next
day
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
ever
go
to
the
Gansevoort
Market
over
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
there
was
such
a
market
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
you
can
get
things
lots
cheaper
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
very
indifferent
to
the
suggestion
.
These
were
things
which
*NL*
she
did
not
like
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
you
pay
for
a
pound
of
meat
?
''
he
asked
one
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
are
different
prices
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
Sirloin
steak
is
*NL*
twenty-two
cents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
steep
,
is
n't
it
?
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
asked
about
other
things
,
until
finally
,
with
the
passing
days
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
become
a
mania
with
him
.
He
learned
the
prices
and
remembered
*NL*
them
.
His
errand-running
capacity
also
improved
.
It
began
in
a
small
*NL*
way
,
of
course
.
Carrie
,
going
to
get
her
hat
one
morning
,
was
stopped
by
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
,
Carrie
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Over
to
the
baker
's
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
just
as
leave
go
for
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
acquiesced
,
and
he
went
.
Each
afternoon
he
would
go
to
the
corner
*NL*
for
the
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
you
want
?
''
he
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
she
began
to
use
him
.
Doing
this
,
however
,
she
lost
the
*NL*
weekly
payment
of
twelve
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
pay
me
to-day
,
''
she
said
one
Tuesday
,
about
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
understood
well
enough
what
it
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
about
five
dollars
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
owe
the
coal
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
day
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
this
Italian
up
here
on
the
corner
sells
coal
at
twenty-five
*NL*
cents
a
bushel
.
I
'll
trade
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
heard
this
with
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
came
to
be
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
,
I
must
have
some
coal
to-day
,
''
or
,
``
You
must
get
some
meat
of
*NL*
some
kind
for
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
find
out
what
she
needed
and
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accompanying
this
plan
came
skimpiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
got
a
half-pound
of
steak
,
''
he
said
,
coming
in
one
afternoon
*NL*
with
his
papers
.
``
We
never
seem
to
eat
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
miserable
details
ate
the
heart
out
of
Carrie
.
They
blackened
her
*NL*
days
and
grieved
her
soul
.
Oh
,
how
this
man
had
changed
!
All
day
and
*NL*
all
day
,
here
he
sat
,
reading
his
papers
.
The
world
seemed
to
have
no
*NL*
attraction
.
Once
in
a
while
he
would
go
out
,
in
fine
weather
,
it
might
*NL*
be
four
or
five
hours
,
between
eleven
and
four
.
She
could
do
nothing
but
*NL*
view
him
with
gnawing
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
apathy
with
Hurstwood
,
resulting
from
his
inability
to
see
his
*NL*
way
out
.
Each
month
drew
from
his
small
store
.
Now
,
he
had
only
five
*NL*
hundred
dollars
left
,
and
this
he
hugged
,
half
feeling
as
if
he
could
*NL*
stave
off
absolute
necessity
for
an
indefinite
period
.
Sitting
around
*NL*
the
house
,
he
decided
to
wear
some
old
clothes
he
had
.
This
came
first
*NL*
with
the
bad
days
.
Only
once
he
apologised
in
the
very
beginning
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
bad
to-day
,
I
'll
just
wear
these
around
.
''
Eventually
these
*NL*
became
the
permanent
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Also
,
he
had
been
wont
to
pay
fifteen
cents
for
a
shave
,
and
a
tip
of
*NL*
ten
cents
.
In
his
first
distress
,
he
cut
down
the
tip
to
five
,
then
to
*NL*
nothing
.
Later
,
he
tried
a
ten-cent
barber
shop
,
and
,
finding
that
the
*NL*
shave
was
satisfactory
,
patronised
regularly
.
Later
still
,
he
put
off
*NL*
shaving
to
every
other
day
,
then
to
every
third
,
and
so
on
,
until
once
a
*NL*
week
became
the
rule
.
On
Saturday
he
was
a
sight
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
as
his
own
self-respect
vanished
,
it
perished
for
him
in
*NL*
Carrie
.
She
could
not
understand
what
had
gotten
into
the
man
.
He
had
*NL*
some
money
,
he
had
a
decent
suit
remaining
,
he
was
not
bad
looking
when
*NL*
dressed
up
.
She
did
not
forget
her
own
difficult
struggle
in
Chicago
,
*NL*
but
she
did
not
forget
either
that
she
had
never
ceased
trying
.
He
never
*NL*
tried
.
He
did
not
even
consult
the
ads
in
the
papers
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
a
distinct
impression
escaped
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
put
so
much
butter
on
the
steak
?
''
he
asked
her
one
*NL*
evening
,
standing
around
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
make
it
good
,
of
course
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Butter
is
awful
dear
these
days
,
''
he
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
mind
it
if
you
were
working
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shut
up
after
this
,
and
went
in
to
his
paper
,
but
the
retort
rankled
*NL*
in
his
mind
.
It
was
the
first
cutting
remark
that
had
come
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
evening
,
Carrie
,
after
reading
,
went
off
to
the
front
room
*NL*
to
bed
.
This
was
unusual
.
When
Hurstwood
decided
to
go
,
he
retired
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
without
a
light
.
It
was
then
that
he
discovered
Carrie
's
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
funny
,
''
he
said
;
``
maybe
she
's
sitting
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
the
matter
no
more
thought
,
but
slept
.
In
the
morning
she
was
*NL*
not
beside
him
.
Strange
to
say
,
this
passed
without
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
approaching
,
and
a
slightly
more
conversational
feeling
*NL*
prevailing
,
Carrie
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'll
sleep
alone
to-night
.
I
have
a
headache
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
night
she
went
to
her
front
bed
without
apologies
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
grim
blow
to
Hurstwood
,
but
he
never
mentioned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
with
an
irrepressible
frown
,
``
let
her
*NL*
sleep
alone
.

Chapter
XXXVI

A
GRIM
RETROGRESSION
--
THE
PHANTOM
OF
CHANCE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Vances
,
who
had
been
back
in
the
city
ever
since
Christmas
,
had
not
*NL*
forgotten
Carrie
;
but
they
,
or
rather
Mrs.
Vance
,
had
never
called
on
*NL*
her
,
for
the
very
simple
reason
that
Carrie
had
never
sent
her
address
.
*NL*
True
to
her
nature
,
she
corresponded
with
Mrs.
Vance
as
long
as
she
*NL*
still
lived
in
Seventy-eighth
Street
,
but
when
she
was
compelled
to
move
*NL*
into
Thirteenth
,
her
fear
that
the
latter
would
take
it
as
an
indication
*NL*
of
reduced
circumstances
caused
her
to
study
some
way
of
avoiding
the
*NL*
necessity
of
giving
her
address
.
Not
finding
any
convenient
method
,
she
*NL*
sorrowfully
resigned
the
privilege
of
writing
to
her
friend
entirely
.
*NL*
The
latter
wondered
at
this
strange
silence
,
thought
Carrie
must
have
*NL*
left
the
city
,
and
in
the
end
gave
her
up
as
lost
.
So
she
was
thoroughly
*NL*
surprised
to
encounter
her
in
Fourteenth
Street
,
where
she
had
gone
*NL*
shopping
.
Carrie
was
there
for
the
same
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mrs.
Wheeler
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
,
looking
Carrie
over
in
a
glance
,
*NL*
``
where
have
you
been
?
Why
have
n't
you
been
to
see
me
?
I
've
been
*NL*
wondering
all
this
time
what
had
become
of
you
.
Really
,
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
glad
to
see
you
,
''
said
Carrie
,
pleased
and
yet
nonplussed
.
Of
*NL*
all
times
,
this
was
the
worst
to
encounter
Mrs.
Vance
.
``
Why
,
I
'm
living
*NL*
down
town
here
.
I
've
been
intending
to
come
and
see
you
.
Where
are
you
*NL*
living
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Fifty-eighth
Street
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
,
``
just
off
Seventh
*NL*
Avenue
--
218
.
Why
do
n't
you
come
and
see
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
Really
,
I
've
been
wanting
to
come
.
I
know
I
*NL*
ought
to
.
It
's
a
shame
.
But
you
know
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
number
?
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirteenth
Street
,
''
said
Carrie
,
reluctantly
.
``
112
West
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
,
``
that
's
right
near
here
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
You
must
come
down
and
see
me
some
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
a
fine
one
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
,
laughing
,
the
while
noting
*NL*
that
Carrie
's
appearance
had
modified
somewhat
.
``
The
address
,
too
,
''
she
*NL*
added
to
herself
.
``
They
must
be
hard
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
she
liked
Carrie
well
enough
to
take
her
in
tow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
with
me
in
here
a
minute
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
turning
into
a
store
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carrie
returned
home
,
there
was
Hurstwood
,
reading
as
usual
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
take
his
condition
with
the
utmost
nonchalance
.
His
beard
was
*NL*
at
least
four
days
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
thought
Carrie
,
``
if
she
were
to
come
here
and
see
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
in
absolute
misery
.
It
looked
as
if
her
situation
was
*NL*
becoming
unbearable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Driven
to
desperation
,
she
asked
at
dinner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
hear
any
more
from
that
wholesale
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
do
n't
want
an
inexperienced
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
dropped
the
subject
,
feeling
unable
to
say
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
Mrs.
Vance
this
afternoon
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
,
eh
?
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
back
in
New
York
now
,
''
Carrie
went
on
.
``
She
did
look
so
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
can
afford
it
as
long
as
he
puts
up
for
it
,
''
returned
*NL*
Hurstwood
.
``
He
's
got
a
soft
job
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
looking
into
the
paper
.
He
could
not
see
the
look
of
*NL*
infinite
weariness
and
discontent
Carrie
gave
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
she
thought
she
'd
call
here
some
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
been
long
getting
round
to
it
,
has
n't
she
?
''
said
Hurstwood
,
with
*NL*
a
kind
of
sarcasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
did
n't
appeal
to
him
from
her
spending
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
,
angered
by
the
man
's
attitude
.
``
Perhaps
*NL*
I
did
n't
want
her
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
too
gay
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
significantly
.
``
No
one
can
keep
up
with
*NL*
her
pace
unless
they
've
got
a
lot
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Vance
does
n't
seem
to
find
it
very
hard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
not
now
,
''
answered
Hurstwood
,
doggedly
,
well
understanding
the
*NL*
inference
;
``
but
his
life
is
n't
done
yet
.
You
ca
n't
tell
what
'll
happen
.
*NL*
He
may
get
down
like
anybody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
quite
knavish
in
the
man
's
attitude
.
His
eye
seemed
*NL*
to
be
cocked
with
a
twinkle
upon
the
fortunate
,
expecting
their
defeat
.
*NL*
His
own
state
seemed
a
thing
apart
--
not
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
thing
was
the
remains
of
his
old-time
cocksureness
and
*NL*
independence
.
Sitting
in
his
flat
,
and
reading
of
the
doings
of
other
*NL*
people
,
sometimes
this
independent
,
undefeated
mood
came
upon
him
.
*NL*
Forgetting
the
weariness
of
the
streets
and
the
degradation
of
search
,
*NL*
he
would
sometimes
prick
up
his
ears
.
It
was
as
if
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
do
something
.
I
'm
not
down
yet
.
There
's
a
lot
of
things
coming
to
*NL*
me
if
I
want
to
go
after
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
this
mood
that
he
would
occasionally
dress
up
,
go
for
a
shave
,
*NL*
and
,
putting
on
his
gloves
,
sally
forth
quite
actively
.
Not
with
any
*NL*
definite
aim
.
It
was
more
a
barometric
condition
.
He
felt
just
right
for
*NL*
being
outside
and
doing
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
such
occasions
,
his
money
went
also
.
He
knew
of
several
poker
rooms
*NL*
down
town
.
A
few
acquaintances
he
had
in
downtown
resorts
and
about
*NL*
the
City
Hall
.
It
was
a
change
to
see
them
and
exchange
a
few
friendly
*NL*
commonplaces
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
once
been
accustomed
to
hold
a
pretty
fair
hand
at
poker
.
Many
a
*NL*
friendly
game
had
netted
him
a
hundred
dollars
or
more
at
the
time
when
*NL*
that
sum
was
merely
sauce
to
the
dish
of
the
game
--
not
the
all
in
all
.
*NL*
Now
,
he
thought
of
playing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
win
a
couple
of
hundred
.
I
'm
not
out
of
practice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
but
fair
to
say
that
this
thought
had
occurred
to
him
several
*NL*
times
before
he
acted
upon
it
.
The
poker
room
which
he
first
invaded
was
*NL*
over
a
saloon
in
West
Street
,
near
one
of
the
ferries
.
He
had
been
*NL*
there
before
.
Several
games
were
going
.
These
he
watched
for
a
time
and
*NL*
noticed
that
the
pots
were
quite
large
for
the
ante
involved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deal
me
a
hand
,
''
he
said
at
the
beginning
of
a
new
shuffle
.
He
pulled
*NL*
up
a
chair
and
studied
his
cards
.
Those
playing
made
that
quiet
study
of
*NL*
him
which
is
so
unapparent
,
and
yet
invariably
so
searching
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
fortune
was
with
him
at
first
.
He
received
a
mixed
collection
*NL*
without
progression
or
pairs
.
The
pot
was
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
pass
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
strength
of
this
,
he
was
content
to
lose
his
ante
.
The
deals
*NL*
did
fairly
by
him
in
the
long
run
,
causing
him
to
come
away
with
a
few
*NL*
dollars
to
the
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
afternoon
he
was
back
again
,
seeking
amusement
and
profit
.
This
*NL*
time
he
followed
up
three
of
a
kind
to
his
doom
.
There
was
a
better
hand
*NL*
across
the
table
,
held
by
a
pugnacious
Irish
youth
,
who
was
a
political
*NL*
hanger-on
of
the
Tammany
district
in
which
they
were
located
.
Hurstwood
*NL*
was
surprised
at
the
persistence
of
this
individual
,
whose
bets
came
*NL*
with
a
sang-froid
which
,
if
a
bluff
,
was
excellent
art
.
Hurstwood
began
*NL*
to
doubt
,
but
kept
,
or
thought
to
keep
,
at
least
,
the
cool
demeanour
*NL*
with
which
,
in
olden
times
,
he
deceived
those
psychic
students
of
the
*NL*
gaming
table
,
who
seem
to
read
thoughts
and
moods
,
rather
than
exterior
*NL*
evidences
,
however
subtle
.
He
could
not
down
the
cowardly
thought
that
*NL*
this
man
had
something
better
and
would
stay
to
the
end
,
drawing
his
*NL*
last
dollar
into
the
pot
,
should
he
choose
to
go
so
far
.
Still
,
he
hoped
*NL*
to
win
much
--
his
hand
was
excellent
.
Why
not
raise
it
five
more
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
raise
you
three
,
''
said
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
it
five
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
pushing
out
his
chips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
again
,
''
said
the
youth
,
pushing
out
a
small
pile
of
reds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
have
some
more
chips
,
''
said
Hurstwood
to
the
keeper
in
charge
,
*NL*
taking
out
a
bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cynical
grin
lit
up
the
face
of
his
youthful
opponent
.
When
the
chips
*NL*
were
laid
out
,
Hurstwood
met
the
raise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
again
,
''
said
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
brow
was
wet
.
He
was
deep
in
now
--
very
deep
for
him
.
Sixty
*NL*
dollars
of
his
good
money
was
up
.
He
was
ordinarily
no
coward
,
but
the
*NL*
thought
of
losing
so
much
weakened
him
.
Finally
he
gave
way
.
He
would
*NL*
not
trust
to
this
fine
hand
any
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
full
house
!
''
said
the
youth
,
spreading
out
his
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
hand
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
had
you
,
''
he
said
,
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
raked
in
his
chips
,
and
Hurstwood
came
away
,
not
without
first
*NL*
stopping
to
count
his
remaining
cash
on
the
stair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
hundred
and
forty
dollars
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
loss
and
ordinary
expenses
,
so
much
had
already
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Back
in
the
flat
,
he
decided
he
would
play
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Remembering
Mrs.
Vance
's
promise
to
call
,
Carrie
made
one
other
mild
*NL*
protest
.
It
was
concerning
Hurstwood
's
appearance
.
This
very
day
,
coming
*NL*
home
,
he
changed
his
clothes
to
the
old
togs
he
sat
around
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
always
put
on
those
old
clothes
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
wearing
my
good
ones
around
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
think
you
'd
feel
better
.
''
Then
she
added
:
``
Some
one
*NL*
might
call
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mrs.
Vance
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
need
n't
see
me
,
''
he
answered
,
sullenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
lack
of
pride
and
interest
made
Carrie
almost
hate
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
thought
,
``
there
he
sits
.
`
She
need
n't
see
me
.
'
I
should
think
*NL*
he
would
be
ashamed
of
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
real
bitterness
of
this
thing
was
added
when
Mrs.
Vance
did
call
.
*NL*
It
was
on
one
of
her
shopping
rounds
.
Making
her
way
up
the
commonplace
*NL*
hall
,
she
knocked
at
Carrie
's
door
.
To
her
subsequent
and
agonising
*NL*
distress
,
Carrie
was
out
.
Hurstwood
opened
the
door
,
half-thinking
that
*NL*
the
knock
was
Carrie
's
.
For
once
,
he
was
taken
honestly
aback
.
The
lost
*NL*
voice
of
youth
and
pride
spoke
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
he
said
,
actually
stammering
,
``
how
do
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
?
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
,
who
could
scarcely
believe
her
eyes
.
*NL*
His
great
confusion
she
instantly
perceived
.
He
did
not
know
whether
to
*NL*
invite
her
in
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
wife
at
home
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
,
``
Carrie
's
out
;
but
wo
n't
you
step
in
?
She
'll
be
back
*NL*
shortly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No-o
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
,
realising
the
change
of
it
all
.
``
I
'm
really
*NL*
very
much
in
a
hurry
.
I
thought
I
'd
just
run
up
and
look
in
,
but
I
*NL*
could
n't
stay
.
Just
tell
your
wife
she
must
come
and
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
standing
back
,
and
feeling
intense
relief
at
*NL*
her
going
.
He
was
so
ashamed
that
he
folded
his
hands
weakly
,
as
he
sat
*NL*
in
the
chair
afterwards
,
and
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
,
coming
in
from
another
direction
,
thought
she
saw
Mrs.
Vance
*NL*
going
away
.
She
strained
her
eyes
,
but
could
not
make
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
anybody
here
just
now
?
''
she
asked
of
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
guiltily
;
``
Mrs.
Vance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
see
you
?
''
she
asked
,
expressing
her
full
despair
.
This
cut
*NL*
Hurstwood
like
a
whip
,
and
made
him
sullen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
had
eyes
,
she
did
.
I
opened
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Carrie
,
closing
one
hand
tightly
out
of
sheer
nervousness
.
*NL*
``
What
did
she
have
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
he
answered
.
``
She
could
n't
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
looking
like
that
!
''
said
Carrie
,
throwing
aside
a
long
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
it
?
''
he
said
,
angering
.
``
I
did
n't
know
she
was
coming
,
did
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knew
she
might
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
told
you
she
said
she
was
coming
.
*NL*
I
've
asked
you
a
dozen
times
to
wear
your
other
clothes
.
Oh
,
I
think
*NL*
this
is
just
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
up
,
''
he
answered
.
``
What
difference
does
it
make
?
You
could
n't
*NL*
associate
with
her
,
anyway
.
They
've
got
too
much
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
said
I
wanted
to
?
''
said
Carrie
,
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
act
like
it
,
rowing
around
over
my
looks
.
You
'd
think
I
'd
*NL*
committed
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
interrupted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
could
n't
if
I
wanted
to
,
but
whose
fault
is
*NL*
it
?
You
're
very
free
to
sit
and
talk
about
who
I
could
associate
with
.
*NL*
Why
do
n't
you
get
out
and
look
for
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
thunderbolt
in
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
it
to
you
?
''
he
said
,
rising
,
almost
fiercely
.
``
I
pay
the
rent
,
*NL*
do
n't
I
?
I
furnish
the
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
pay
the
rent
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
You
talk
as
if
there
was
nothing
*NL*
else
in
the
world
but
a
flat
to
sit
around
in
.
You
have
n't
done
a
thing
*NL*
for
three
months
except
sit
around
and
interfere
here
.
I
'd
like
to
know
*NL*
what
you
married
me
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
marry
you
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
snarling
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
know
what
you
did
,
then
,
in
Montreal
?
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
n't
marry
you
,
''
he
answered
.
``
You
can
get
that
out
of
your
*NL*
head
.
You
talk
as
though
you
did
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
a
moment
,
her
eyes
distending
.
She
had
believed
it
*NL*
was
all
legal
and
binding
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
lie
to
me
for
,
then
?
''
she
asked
,
fiercely
.
``
What
did
you
*NL*
force
me
to
run
away
with
you
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
became
almost
a
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Force
!
''
he
said
,
with
curled
lip
.
``
A
lot
of
forcing
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Carrie
,
breaking
under
the
strain
,
and
turning
.
``
Oh
,
oh
!
''
and
*NL*
she
hurried
into
the
front
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
now
hot
and
waked
up
.
It
was
a
great
shaking
up
for
him
,
*NL*
both
mental
and
moral
.
He
wiped
his
brow
as
he
looked
around
,
and
then
*NL*
went
for
his
clothes
and
dressed
.
Not
a
sound
came
from
Carrie
;
she
*NL*
ceased
sobbing
when
she
heard
him
dressing
.
She
thought
,
at
first
,
with
*NL*
the
faintest
alarm
,
of
being
left
without
money
--
not
of
losing
him
,
*NL*
though
he
might
be
going
away
permanently
.
She
heard
him
open
the
top
of
*NL*
the
wardrobe
and
take
out
his
hat
.
Then
the
dining-room
door
closed
,
and
*NL*
she
knew
he
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
moments
of
silence
,
she
stood
up
,
dry-eyed
,
and
looked
out
*NL*
the
window
.
Hurstwood
was
just
strolling
up
the
street
,
from
the
flat
,
*NL*
toward
Sixth
Avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
made
progress
along
Thirteenth
and
across
Fourteenth
Street
*NL*
to
Union
Square
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
for
work
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Look
for
work
!
She
tells
me
to
get
*NL*
out
and
look
for
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
shield
himself
from
his
own
mental
accusation
,
which
told
*NL*
him
that
she
was
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
cursed
thing
that
Mrs.
Vance
's
call
was
,
anyhow
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
``
Stood
right
there
,
and
looked
me
over
.
I
know
what
she
was
thinking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
remembered
the
few
times
he
had
seen
her
in
Seventy-eight
Street
.
She
*NL*
was
always
a
swell-looker
,
and
he
had
tried
to
put
on
the
air
of
being
*NL*
worthy
of
such
as
she
,
in
front
of
her
.
Now
,
to
think
she
had
caught
him
*NL*
looking
this
way
.
He
wrinkled
his
forehead
in
his
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
he
said
a
dozen
times
in
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
quarter
after
four
when
he
left
the
house
.
Carrie
was
in
tears
.
*NL*
There
would
be
no
dinner
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
deuce
,
''
he
said
,
swaggering
mentally
to
hide
his
own
shame
*NL*
from
himself
.
``
I
'm
not
so
bad
.
I
'm
not
down
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
around
the
square
,
and
seeing
the
several
large
hotels
,
*NL*
decided
to
go
to
one
for
dinner
.
He
would
get
his
papers
and
make
*NL*
himself
comfortable
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ascended
into
the
fine
parlour
of
the
Morton
House
,
then
one
of
the
*NL*
best
New
York
hotels
,
and
,
finding
a
cushioned
seat
,
read
.
It
did
not
*NL*
trouble
him
much
that
his
decreasing
sum
of
money
did
not
allow
of
such
*NL*
extravagance
.
Like
the
morphine
fiend
,
he
was
becoming
addicted
to
his
*NL*
ease
.
Anything
to
relieve
his
mental
distress
,
to
satisfy
his
craving
*NL*
for
comfort
.
He
must
do
it
.
No
thoughts
for
the
morrow
--
he
could
not
*NL*
stand
to
think
of
it
any
more
than
he
could
of
any
other
calamity
.
Like
*NL*
the
certainty
of
death
,
he
tried
to
shut
the
certainty
of
soon
being
*NL*
without
a
dollar
completely
out
of
his
mind
,
and
he
came
very
near
doing
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well-dressed
guests
moving
to
and
fro
over
the
thick
carpets
carried
*NL*
him
back
to
the
old
days
.
A
young
lady
,
a
guest
of
the
house
,
playing
a
*NL*
piano
in
an
alcove
pleased
him
.
He
sat
there
reading
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
dinner
cost
him
$
1.50
.
By
eight
o'clock
he
was
through
,
and
then
,
*NL*
seeing
guests
leaving
and
the
crowd
of
pleasure-seekers
thickening
*NL*
outside
wondered
where
he
should
go
.
Not
home
.
Carrie
would
be
up
.
No
,
*NL*
he
would
not
go
back
there
this
evening
.
He
would
stay
out
and
knock
*NL*
around
as
a
man
who
was
independent
--
not
broke
--
well
might
.
He
bought
*NL*
a
cigar
,
and
went
outside
on
the
corner
where
other
individuals
were
*NL*
lounging
--
brokers
,
racing
people
,
thespians
--
his
own
flesh
and
blood
.
*NL*
As
he
stood
there
,
he
thought
of
the
old
evenings
in
Chicago
,
and
how
*NL*
he
used
to
dispose
of
them
.
Many
's
the
game
he
had
had
.
This
took
him
to
*NL*
poker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
do
that
thing
right
the
other
day
,
''
he
thought
,
referring
*NL*
to
his
loss
of
sixty
dollars
.
``
I
should
n't
have
weakened
.
I
could
have
*NL*
bluffed
that
fellow
down
.
I
was
n't
in
form
,
that
's
what
ailed
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
studied
the
possibilities
of
the
game
as
it
had
been
played
,
and
*NL*
began
to
figure
how
he
might
have
won
,
in
several
instances
,
by
bluffing
*NL*
a
little
harder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
old
enough
to
play
poker
and
do
something
with
it
.
I
'll
try
my
hand
*NL*
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Visions
of
a
big
stake
floated
before
him
.
Supposing
he
did
win
a
couple
*NL*
of
hundred
,
would
n't
he
be
in
it
?
Lots
of
sports
he
knew
made
their
*NL*
living
at
this
game
,
and
a
good
living
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
always
had
as
much
as
I
had
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
off
he
went
to
a
poker
room
in
the
neighbourhood
,
feeling
much
as
he
*NL*
had
in
the
old
days
.
In
this
period
of
self-forgetfulness
,
aroused
first
*NL*
by
the
shock
of
argument
and
perfected
by
a
dinner
in
the
hotel
,
with
*NL*
cocktails
and
cigars
,
he
was
as
nearly
like
the
old
Hurstwood
as
he
*NL*
would
ever
be
again
.
It
was
not
the
old
Hurstwood
--
only
a
man
arguing
*NL*
with
a
divided
conscience
and
lured
by
a
phantom
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
poker
room
was
much
like
the
other
one
,
only
it
was
a
back
room
in
*NL*
a
better
drinking
resort
.
Hurstwood
watched
a
while
,
and
then
,
seeing
*NL*
an
interesting
game
,
joined
in
.
As
before
,
it
went
easy
for
a
while
,
he
*NL*
winning
a
few
times
and
cheering
up
,
losing
a
few
pots
and
growing
more
*NL*
interested
and
determined
on
that
account
.
At
last
the
fascinating
*NL*
game
took
a
strong
hold
on
him
.
He
enjoyed
its
risks
and
ventured
,
on
*NL*
a
trifling
hand
,
to
bluff
the
company
and
secure
a
fair
stake
.
To
his
*NL*
self-satisfaction
intense
and
strong
,
he
did
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
height
of
this
feeling
he
began
to
think
his
luck
was
with
him
.
*NL*
No
one
else
had
done
so
well
.
Now
came
another
moderate
hand
,
and
again
*NL*
he
tried
to
open
the
jack-pot
on
it
.
There
were
others
there
who
were
*NL*
almost
reading
his
heart
,
so
close
was
their
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
three
of
a
kind
,
''
said
one
of
the
players
to
himself
.
``
I
'll
just
*NL*
stay
with
that
fellow
to
the
finish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
was
that
bidding
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
raise
you
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
got
to
where
Hurstwood
had
seventy-five
dollars
up
.
The
other
man
*NL*
really
became
serious
.
Perhaps
this
individual
-LRB-
Hurstwood
-RRB-
really
did
*NL*
have
a
stiff
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
showed
his
hand
.
He
was
done
.
The
bitter
fact
that
he
had
lost
*NL*
seventy-five
dollars
made
him
desperate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
have
another
pot
,
''
he
said
,
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
other
players
quit
,
but
observant
loungers
took
their
*NL*
places
.
Time
passed
,
and
it
came
to
twelve
o'clock
.
Hurstwood
held
on
,
*NL*
neither
winning
nor
losing
much
.
Then
he
grew
weary
,
and
on
a
last
hand
*NL*
lost
twenty
more
.
He
was
sick
at
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
quarter
after
one
in
the
morning
he
came
out
of
the
place
.
The
*NL*
chill
,
bare
streets
seemed
a
mockery
of
his
state
.
He
walked
slowly
*NL*
west
,
little
thinking
of
his
row
with
Carrie
.
He
ascended
the
stairs
and
*NL*
went
into
his
room
as
if
there
had
been
no
trouble
.
It
was
his
loss
that
*NL*
occupied
his
mind
.
Sitting
down
on
the
bedside
he
counted
his
money
.
*NL*
There
was
now
but
a
hundred
and
ninety
dollars
and
some
change
.
He
put
*NL*
it
up
and
began
to
undress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
what
's
getting
into
me
,
anyhow
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Carrie
scarcely
spoke
and
he
felt
as
if
he
must
go
out
*NL*
again
.
He
had
treated
her
badly
,
but
he
could
not
afford
to
make
up
.
Now
*NL*
desperation
seized
him
,
and
for
a
day
or
two
,
going
out
thus
,
he
lived
*NL*
like
a
gentleman
--
or
what
he
conceived
to
be
a
gentleman
--
which
took
*NL*
money
.
For
his
escapades
he
was
soon
poorer
in
mind
and
body
,
to
say
*NL*
nothing
of
his
purse
,
which
had
lost
thirty
by
the
process
.
Then
he
came
*NL*
down
to
cold
,
bitter
sense
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rent
man
comes
to-day
,
''
said
Carrie
,
greeting
him
thus
*NL*
indifferently
three
mornings
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
this
is
the
second
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
frowned
.
Then
in
despair
he
got
out
his
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
an
awful
lot
to
pay
for
rent
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
nearing
his
last
hundred
dollars
.
*NL*

*NL*
Chapter
XXXVII
.
THE
SPIRIT
AWAKENS
--
NEW
SEARCH
FOR
THE
GATE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
useless
to
explain
how
in
due
time
the
last
fifty
dollars
*NL*
was
in
sight
.
The
seven
hundred
,
by
his
process
of
handling
,
had
only
*NL*
carried
them
into
June
.
Before
the
final
hundred
mark
was
reached
he
*NL*
began
to
indicate
that
a
calamity
was
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
said
one
day
,
taking
a
trivial
expenditure
for
meat
*NL*
as
a
text
,
``
it
seems
to
take
an
awful
lot
for
us
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
seem
to
me
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
that
we
spend
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
money
is
nearly
gone
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
hardly
know
where
it
's
gone
*NL*
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
seven
hundred
dollars
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
but
a
hundred
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
so
disconsolate
that
it
scared
her
.
She
began
to
see
that
she
*NL*
herself
had
been
drifting
.
She
had
felt
it
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
George
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
why
do
n't
you
get
out
and
look
for
*NL*
something
?
You
could
find
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
looked
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
can
t
make
people
give
you
a
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
weakly
at
him
and
said
:
``
Well
,
what
do
you
think
you
will
do
?
*NL*
A
hundred
dollars
wo
n't
last
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
ca
n't
do
any
more
than
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
became
frightened
over
this
announcement
.
She
thought
desperately
*NL*
upon
the
subject
.
Frequently
she
had
considered
the
stage
as
a
door
*NL*
through
which
she
might
enter
that
gilded
state
which
she
had
so
much
*NL*
craved
.
Now
,
as
in
Chicago
,
it
came
as
a
last
resource
in
distress
.
*NL*
Something
must
be
done
if
he
did
not
get
work
soon
.
Perhaps
she
would
*NL*
have
to
go
out
and
battle
again
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
wonder
how
one
would
go
about
getting
a
place
.
Her
*NL*
experience
in
Chicago
proved
that
she
had
not
tried
the
right
way
.
There
*NL*
must
be
people
who
would
listen
to
and
try
you
--
men
who
would
give
you
*NL*
an
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
talking
at
the
breakfast
table
,
a
morning
or
two
later
,
when
*NL*
she
brought
up
the
dramatic
subject
by
saying
that
she
saw
that
Sarah
*NL*
Bernhardt
was
coming
to
this
country
.
Hurstwood
had
seen
it
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
people
get
on
the
stage
,
George
?
''
she
finally
asked
,
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
said
.
``
There
must
be
dramatic
agents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
sipping
coffee
,
and
did
not
look
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Regular
people
who
get
you
a
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
so
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
air
with
which
she
asked
attracted
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
still
thinking
about
being
an
actress
,
are
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
,
``
I
was
just
wondering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
being
clear
,
there
was
something
in
the
thought
which
he
*NL*
objected
to
.
He
did
not
believe
any
more
,
after
three
years
of
*NL*
observation
,
that
Carrie
would
ever
do
anything
great
in
that
line
.
*NL*
She
seemed
too
simple
,
too
yielding
.
His
idea
of
the
art
was
that
it
*NL*
involved
something
more
pompous
.
If
she
tried
to
get
on
the
stage
she
*NL*
would
fall
into
the
hands
of
some
cheap
manager
and
become
like
the
rest
*NL*
of
them
.
He
had
a
good
idea
of
what
he
meant
by
THEM
.
Carrie
was
pretty
.
*NL*
She
would
get
along
all
right
,
but
where
would
he
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
get
that
idea
out
of
my
head
,
if
I
were
you
.
It
's
a
lot
more
*NL*
difficult
than
you
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
felt
this
to
contain
,
in
some
way
,
an
aspersion
upon
her
ability
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
I
did
real
well
in
Chicago
,
''
she
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
,
''
he
answered
,
seeing
that
he
was
arousing
opposition
,
``
but
*NL*
Chicago
is
n't
New
York
,
by
a
big
jump
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
did
not
answer
this
at
all
.
It
hurt
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
stage
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
is
all
right
if
you
can
be
one
of
the
big
*NL*
guns
,
but
there
's
nothing
to
the
rest
of
it
.
It
takes
a
long
while
to
*NL*
get
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
,
slightly
aroused
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
flash
,
he
thought
he
foresaw
the
result
of
this
thing
.
Now
,
when
*NL*
the
worst
of
his
situation
was
approaching
,
she
would
get
on
the
stage
*NL*
in
some
cheap
way
and
forsake
him
.
Strangely
,
he
had
not
conceived
well
*NL*
of
her
mental
ability
.
That
was
because
he
did
not
understand
the
nature
*NL*
of
emotional
greatness
.
He
had
never
learned
that
a
person
might
be
*NL*
emotionally
--
instead
of
intellectually
--
great
.
Avery
Hall
was
too
far
*NL*
away
for
him
to
look
back
and
sharply
remember
.
He
had
lived
with
this
*NL*
woman
too
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
,
''
he
answered
.
``
If
I
were
you
I
would
n't
think
of
it
.
It
's
*NL*
not
much
of
a
profession
for
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
better
than
going
hungry
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
If
you
do
n't
want
me
to
*NL*
do
that
,
why
do
n't
you
get
work
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
ready
for
this
.
He
had
got
used
to
the
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
up
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
of
this
was
that
she
secretly
resolved
to
try
.
It
did
n't
*NL*
matter
about
him
.
She
was
not
going
to
be
dragged
into
poverty
and
*NL*
something
worse
to
suit
him
.
She
could
act
.
She
could
get
something
*NL*
and
then
work
up
.
What
would
he
say
then
?
She
pictured
herself
already
*NL*
appearing
in
some
fine
performance
on
Broadway
;
of
going
every
evening
*NL*
to
her
dressing-room
and
making
up
.
Then
she
would
come
out
at
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
and
see
the
carriages
ranged
about
,
waiting
for
the
people
.
It
*NL*
did
not
matter
whether
she
was
the
star
or
not
.
If
she
were
only
once
*NL*
in
,
getting
a
decent
salary
,
wearing
the
kind
of
clothes
she
liked
,
*NL*
having
the
money
to
do
with
,
going
here
and
there
as
she
pleased
,
how
*NL*
delightful
it
would
all
be
.
Her
mind
ran
over
this
picture
all
the
day
*NL*
long
.
Hurstwood
's
dreary
state
made
its
beauty
become
more
and
more
*NL*
vivid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curiously
this
idea
soon
took
hold
of
Hurstwood
.
His
vanishing
sum
*NL*
suggested
that
he
would
need
sustenance
.
Why
could
not
Carrie
assist
him
*NL*
a
little
until
he
could
get
something
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
in
one
day
with
something
of
this
idea
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
John
B.
Drake
to-day
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
's
going
to
open
a
hotel
here
*NL*
in
the
fall
.
He
says
that
he
can
make
a
place
for
me
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
he
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
the
man
that
runs
the
Grand
Pacific
in
Chicago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
get
about
fourteen
hundred
a
year
out
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
good
,
would
n't
it
?
''
she
said
,
sympathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
can
only
get
over
this
summer
,
''
he
added
,
``
I
think
I
'll
be
all
*NL*
right
.
I
'm
hearing
from
some
of
my
friends
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
swallowed
this
story
in
all
its
pristine
beauty
.
She
sincerely
*NL*
wished
he
could
get
through
the
summer
.
He
looked
so
hopeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
money
have
you
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
fifty
dollars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mercy
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
what
will
we
do
?
It
's
only
twenty
days
*NL*
until
the
rent
will
be
due
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
rested
his
head
on
his
hands
and
looked
blankly
at
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
you
could
get
something
in
the
stage
line
?
''
he
blandly
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
could
,
''
said
Carrie
,
glad
that
some
one
approved
of
the
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
lay
my
hand
to
whatever
I
can
get
,
''
he
said
,
now
that
he
saw
her
*NL*
brighten
up
.
``
I
can
get
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
cleaned
up
the
things
one
morning
after
he
had
gone
,
dressed
as
*NL*
neatly
as
her
wardrobe
permitted
,
and
set
out
for
Broadway
.
She
did
*NL*
not
know
that
thoroughfare
very
well
.
To
her
it
was
a
wonderful
*NL*
conglomeration
of
everything
great
and
mighty
.
The
theatres
were
*NL*
there
--
these
agencies
must
be
somewhere
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
decided
to
stop
in
at
the
Madison
Square
Theatre
and
ask
how
to
find
*NL*
the
theatrical
agents
.
This
seemed
the
sensible
way
.
Accordingly
,
when
*NL*
she
reached
that
theatre
she
applied
to
the
clerk
at
the
box
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
''
he
said
,
looking
out
.
``
Dramatic
agents
?
I
do
n't
know
.
You
'll
find
*NL*
them
in
the
`
Clipper
,
'
though
.
They
all
advertise
in
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
a
paper
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
clerk
,
marvelling
at
such
ignorance
of
a
common
fact
.
*NL*
``
You
can
get
it
at
the
news-stands
,
''
he
added
politely
,
seeing
how
*NL*
pretty
the
inquirer
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
proceeded
to
get
the
``
Clipper
,
''
and
tried
to
find
the
agents
by
*NL*
looking
over
it
as
she
stood
beside
the
stand
.
This
could
not
be
done
so
*NL*
easily
.
Thirteenth
Street
was
a
number
of
blocks
off
,
but
she
went
back
,
*NL*
carrying
the
precious
paper
and
regretting
the
waste
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
already
there
,
sitting
in
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
were
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
trying
to
find
some
dramatic
agents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
a
little
diffident
about
asking
concerning
her
success
.
The
*NL*
paper
she
began
to
scan
attracted
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
got
there
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
`
Clipper
.
'
The
man
said
I
'd
find
their
addresses
in
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
all
the
way
over
to
Broadway
to
find
that
out
?
I
could
*NL*
have
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
?
''
she
asked
,
without
looking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
asked
me
,
''
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
hunting
aimlessly
through
the
crowded
columns
.
Her
mind
was
*NL*
distracted
by
this
man
's
indifference
.
The
difficulty
of
the
situation
*NL*
she
was
facing
was
only
added
to
by
all
he
did
.
Self-commiseration
*NL*
brewed
in
her
heart
.
Tears
trembled
along
her
eyelids
but
did
not
fall
.
*NL*
Hurstwood
noticed
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
recover
herself
she
went
into
the
front
room
while
he
searched
.
*NL*
Presently
she
returned
.
He
had
a
pencil
,
and
was
writing
upon
an
*NL*
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
're
three
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
took
it
and
found
that
one
was
Mrs.
Bermudez
,
another
Marcus
*NL*
Jenks
,
a
third
Percy
Weil
.
She
paused
only
a
moment
,
and
then
moved
*NL*
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
as
well
go
right
away
,
''
she
said
,
without
looking
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
saw
her
depart
with
some
faint
stirrings
of
shame
,
which
were
*NL*
the
expression
of
a
manhood
rapidly
becoming
stultified
.
He
sat
a
while
,
*NL*
and
then
it
became
too
much
.
He
got
up
and
put
on
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
I
'll
go
out
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
and
went
,
strolling
nowhere
*NL*
in
particular
,
but
feeling
somehow
that
he
must
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
's
first
call
was
upon
Mrs.
Bermudez
,
whose
address
was
quite
the
*NL*
nearest
.
It
was
an
old-fashioned
residence
turned
into
offices
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Bermudez
's
offices
consisted
of
what
formerly
had
been
a
back
chamber
*NL*
and
a
hall
bedroom
,
marked
``
Private
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Carrie
entered
she
noticed
several
persons
lounging
about
--
men
,
who
*NL*
said
nothing
and
did
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
waiting
to
be
noticed
,
the
door
of
the
hall
bedroom
opened
*NL*
and
from
it
issued
two
very
mannish-looking
women
,
very
tightly
dressed
,
*NL*
and
wearing
white
collars
and
cuffs
.
After
them
came
a
portly
lady
of
*NL*
about
forty-five
,
light-haired
,
sharp-eyed
,
and
evidently
good-natured
.
*NL*
At
least
she
was
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
do
n't
forget
about
that
,
''
said
one
of
the
mannish
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
the
portly
woman
.
``
Let
's
see
,
''
she
added
,
``
where
are
you
*NL*
the
first
week
in
February
?
''
``
Pittsburg
,
''
said
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
write
you
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
the
other
,
and
the
two
passed
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
the
portly
lady
's
face
became
exceedingly
sober
and
shrewd
.
*NL*
She
turned
about
and
fixed
on
Carrie
a
very
searching
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
``
young
woman
,
what
can
I
do
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
Mrs.
Bermudez
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Carrie
,
hesitating
how
to
begin
,
``
do
you
get
places
for
*NL*
persons
upon
the
stage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
get
me
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
had
any
experience
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
little
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
did
you
play
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
with
no
one
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
It
was
just
a
show
gotten
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
see
,
''
said
the
woman
,
interrupting
her
.
``
No
,
I
do
n't
know
of
*NL*
anything
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
's
countenance
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
get
some
New
York
experience
,
''
concluded
the
affable
Mrs.
*NL*
Bermudez
.
``
We
'll
take
your
name
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
stood
looking
while
the
lady
retired
to
her
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
address
?
''
inquired
a
young
lady
behind
the
counter
,
taking
*NL*
up
the
curtailed
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
George
Wheeler
,
''
said
Carrie
,
moving
over
to
where
she
was
*NL*
writing
.
The
woman
wrote
her
address
in
full
and
then
allowed
her
to
*NL*
depart
at
her
leisure
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
encountered
a
very
similar
experience
in
the
office
of
Mr.
Jenks
,
*NL*
only
he
varied
it
by
saying
at
the
close
:
``
If
you
could
play
at
some
*NL*
local
house
,
or
had
a
programme
with
your
name
on
it
,
I
might
do
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
third
place
the
individual
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
work
do
you
want
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
do
you
want
to
get
in
a
comedy
or
on
the
vaudeville
or
in
the
*NL*
chorus
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'd
like
to
get
a
part
in
a
play
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
it
'll
cost
you
something
to
do
that
.
''
``
How
much
?
''
*NL*
said
Carrie
,
who
,
ridiculous
as
it
may
seem
,
had
not
thought
of
this
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
for
you
to
say
,
''
he
answered
shrewdly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
curiously
.
She
hardly
knew
how
to
continue
the
*NL*
inquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
get
me
a
part
if
I
paid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
did
n't
you
'd
get
your
money
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
agent
saw
he
was
dealing
with
an
inexperienced
soul
,
and
continued
*NL*
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
want
to
deposit
fifty
dollars
,
anyway
.
No
agent
would
trouble
*NL*
about
you
for
less
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
saw
a
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'll
think
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
to
go
,
and
then
bethought
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
soon
would
I
get
a
place
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
hard
to
say
,
''
said
the
man
.
``
You
might
get
one
in
a
week
,
*NL*
or
it
might
be
a
month
.
You
'd
get
the
first
thing
that
we
thought
you
*NL*
could
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
Carrie
,
and
then
,
half-smiling
to
be
agreeable
,
she
walked
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
agent
studied
a
moment
,
and
then
said
to
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
funny
how
anxious
these
women
are
to
get
on
the
stage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
found
ample
food
for
reflection
in
the
fifty-dollar
proposition
.
*NL*
``
Maybe
they
'd
take
my
money
and
not
give
me
anything
,
''
she
thought
.
She
*NL*
had
some
jewelry
--
a
diamond
ring
and
pin
and
several
other
pieces
.
She
*NL*
could
get
fifty
dollars
for
those
if
she
went
to
a
pawnbroker
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
home
before
her
.
He
had
not
thought
she
would
be
so
long
*NL*
seeking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
said
,
not
venturing
to
ask
what
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
find
out
anything
to-day
,
''
said
Carrie
,
taking
off
her
gloves
.
*NL*
``
They
all
want
money
to
get
you
a
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
asked
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty
dollars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
want
anything
,
do
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
're
like
everybody
else
.
You
ca
n't
tell
whether
they
'd
ever
get
*NL*
you
anything
after
you
did
pay
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
would
n't
put
up
fifty
on
that
basis
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
as
if
he
*NL*
were
deciding
,
money
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
think
I
'll
try
some
of
the
managers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
heard
this
,
dead
to
the
horror
of
it
.
He
rocked
a
little
to
*NL*
and
fro
,
and
chewed
at
his
finger
.
It
seemed
all
very
natural
in
such
*NL*
extreme
states
.
He
would
do
better
later
on

IN
ELF
LAND
DISPORTING
--
THE
GRIM
WORLD
WITHOUT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carrie
renewed
her
search
,
as
she
did
the
next
day
,
going
to
*NL*
the
Casino
,
she
found
that
in
the
opera
chorus
,
as
in
other
fields
,
*NL*
employment
is
difficult
to
secure
.
Girls
who
can
stand
in
a
line
and
*NL*
look
pretty
are
as
numerous
as
labourers
who
can
swing
a
pick
.
She
found
*NL*
there
was
no
discrimination
between
one
and
the
other
of
applicants
,
*NL*
save
as
regards
a
conventional
standard
of
prettiness
and
form
.
Their
*NL*
own
opinion
or
knowledge
of
their
ability
went
for
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
shall
I
find
Mr.
Gray
?
''
she
asked
of
a
sulky
doorman
at
the
stage
*NL*
entrance
of
the
Casino
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
see
him
now
;
he
's
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
when
I
can
see
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
an
appointment
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'll
have
to
call
at
his
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
''
exclaimed
Carrie
.
``
Where
is
his
office
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
the
number
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
there
was
no
need
of
calling
there
now
.
He
would
not
be
in
.
*NL*
Nothing
remained
but
to
employ
the
intermediate
hours
in
search
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dismal
story
of
ventures
in
other
places
is
quickly
told
.
Mr.
Daly
*NL*
saw
no
one
save
by
appointment
.
Carrie
waited
an
hour
in
a
dingy
*NL*
office
,
quite
in
spite
of
obstacles
,
to
learn
this
fact
of
the
placid
,
*NL*
indifferent
Mr.
Dorney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
have
to
write
and
ask
him
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Empire
Theatre
she
found
a
hive
of
peculiarly
listless
and
*NL*
indifferent
individuals
.
Everything
ornately
upholstered
,
everything
*NL*
carefully
finished
,
everything
remarkably
reserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Lyceum
she
entered
one
of
those
secluded
,
under-stairway
closets
,
*NL*
berugged
and
bepaneled
,
which
causes
one
to
feel
the
greatness
of
all
*NL*
positions
of
authority
.
Here
was
reserve
itself
done
into
a
box-office
*NL*
clerk
,
a
doorman
,
and
an
assistant
,
glorying
in
their
fine
positions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
be
very
humble
now
--
very
humble
indeed
.
Tell
us
what
it
is
*NL*
you
require
.
Tell
it
quickly
,
nervously
,
and
without
a
vestige
of
*NL*
self-respect
.
If
no
trouble
to
us
in
any
way
,
we
may
see
what
we
can
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
atmosphere
of
the
Lyceum
--
the
attitude
,
for
that
matter
,
*NL*
of
every
managerial
office
in
the
city
.
These
little
proprietors
of
*NL*
businesses
are
lords
indeed
on
their
own
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
came
away
wearily
,
somewhat
more
abashed
for
her
pains
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
heard
the
details
of
the
weary
and
unavailing
search
that
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
get
to
see
any
one
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
just
walked
,
and
walked
,
*NL*
and
waited
around
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
only
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
have
to
have
some
friends
before
you
can
get
in
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
disconsolately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
saw
the
difficulty
of
this
thing
,
and
yet
it
did
not
seem
*NL*
so
terrible
.
Carrie
was
tired
and
dispirited
,
but
now
she
could
rest
.
*NL*
Viewing
the
world
from
his
rocking-chair
,
its
bitterness
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
approach
so
rapidly
.
To-morrow
was
another
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-morrow
came
,
and
the
next
,
and
the
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
saw
the
manager
at
the
Casino
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
around
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
first
of
next
week
.
I
may
make
some
changes
*NL*
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
large
and
corpulent
individual
,
surfeited
with
good
clothes
and
*NL*
good
eating
,
who
judged
women
as
another
would
horseflesh
.
Carrie
was
*NL*
pretty
and
graceful
.
She
might
be
put
in
even
if
she
did
not
have
any
*NL*
experience
.
One
of
the
proprietors
had
suggested
that
the
chorus
was
a
*NL*
little
weak
on
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
of
next
week
was
some
days
off
yet
.
The
first
of
the
month
was
*NL*
drawing
near
.
Carrie
began
to
worry
as
she
had
never
worried
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
look
for
anything
when
you
go
out
?
''
she
asked
Hurstwood
*NL*
one
morning
as
a
climax
to
some
painful
thoughts
of
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
do
,
''
he
said
pettishly
,
troubling
only
a
little
over
the
*NL*
disgrace
of
the
insinuation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
take
anything
,
''
she
said
,
``
for
the
present
.
It
will
soon
be
the
*NL*
first
of
the
month
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
the
picture
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
quit
reading
his
paper
and
changed
his
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
look
for
something
,
''
he
thought
.
``
He
would
go
and
see
if
some
*NL*
brewery
could
n't
get
him
in
somewhere
.
Yes
,
he
would
take
a
position
as
*NL*
bartender
,
if
he
could
get
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
same
sort
of
pilgrimage
he
had
made
before
.
One
or
two
slight
*NL*
rebuffs
,
and
the
bravado
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
use
,
''
he
thought
.
``
I
might
as
well
go
on
back
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
his
money
was
so
low
,
he
began
to
observe
his
clothes
and
feel
*NL*
that
even
his
best
ones
were
beginning
to
look
commonplace
.
This
was
a
*NL*
bitter
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
came
in
after
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
see
some
of
the
variety
managers
,
''
she
said
,
aimlessly
.
``
You
*NL*
have
to
have
an
act
.
They
do
n't
want
anybody
that
has
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
some
of
the
brewery
people
to-day
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
One
man
told
*NL*
me
he
'd
try
to
make
a
place
for
me
in
two
or
three
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
face
of
so
much
distress
on
Carrie
's
part
,
he
had
to
make
some
*NL*
showing
,
and
it
was
thus
he
did
so
.
It
was
lassitude
's
apology
to
*NL*
energy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monday
Carrie
went
again
to
the
Casino
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
tell
you
to
come
around
to
day
?
''
said
the
manager
,
looking
her
*NL*
over
as
she
stood
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
the
first
of
the
week
,
''
said
Carrie
,
greatly
abashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ever
had
any
experience
?
''
he
asked
again
,
almost
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
owned
to
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
her
over
again
as
he
stirred
among
some
papers
.
He
was
*NL*
secretly
pleased
with
this
pretty
,
disturbed-looking
young
woman
.
``
Come
*NL*
around
to
the
theatre
to-morrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
's
heart
bounded
to
her
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
she
said
with
difficulty
.
She
could
see
he
wanted
her
,
and
*NL*
turned
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
he
really
put
her
to
work
?
Oh
,
blessed
fortune
,
could
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Already
the
hard
rumble
of
the
city
through
the
open
windows
became
*NL*
pleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sharp
voice
answered
her
mental
interrogation
,
driving
away
all
*NL*
immediate
fears
on
that
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
sure
you
're
there
promptly
,
''
the
manager
said
roughly
.
``
You
'll
be
*NL*
dropped
if
you
're
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
hastened
away
.
She
did
not
quarrel
now
with
Hurstwood
's
idleness
.
*NL*
She
had
a
place
--
she
had
a
place
!
This
sang
in
her
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
delight
she
was
almost
anxious
to
tell
Hurstwood
.
But
,
as
she
*NL*
walked
homeward
,
and
her
survey
of
the
facts
of
the
case
became
larger
,
*NL*
she
began
to
think
of
the
anomaly
of
her
finding
work
in
several
weeks
*NL*
and
his
lounging
in
idleness
for
a
number
of
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
he
get
something
?
''
she
openly
said
to
herself
.
``
If
I
can
he
*NL*
surely
ought
to
.
It
was
n't
very
hard
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
forgot
her
youth
and
her
beauty
.
The
handicap
of
age
she
did
not
,
in
*NL*
her
enthusiasm
,
perceive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
ever
,
the
voice
of
success
.
Still
,
she
could
not
keep
her
secret
.
*NL*
She
tried
to
be
calm
and
indifferent
,
but
it
was
a
palpable
sham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
said
,
seeing
her
relieved
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
?
''
he
said
,
breathing
a
better
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
a
place
is
it
?
''
he
asked
,
feeling
in
his
veins
as
if
now
*NL*
he
might
get
something
good
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
chorus
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
the
Casino
show
you
told
me
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
begin
rehearsing
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
more
explanation
volunteered
by
Carrie
,
because
she
was
happy
.
*NL*
At
last
Hurstwood
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
how
much
you
'll
get
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
did
n't
want
to
ask
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
guess
they
pay
twelve
or
*NL*
fourteen
dollars
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
that
,
I
guess
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
good
dinner
in
the
flat
that
evening
,
owing
to
the
mere
*NL*
lifting
of
the
terrible
strain
.
Hurstwood
went
out
for
a
shave
,
and
*NL*
returned
with
a
fair-sized
sirloin
steak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
to-morrow
,
''
he
thought
,
``
I
'll
look
around
myself
,
''
and
with
*NL*
renewed
hope
he
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
Carrie
reported
promptly
and
was
given
a
place
in
the
*NL*
line
.
She
saw
a
large
,
empty
,
shadowy
play-house
,
still
redolent
of
the
*NL*
perfumes
and
blazonry
of
the
night
,
and
notable
for
its
rich
,
oriental
*NL*
appearance
.
The
wonder
of
it
awed
and
delighted
her
.
Blessed
be
its
*NL*
wondrous
reality
.
How
hard
she
would
try
to
be
worthy
of
it
.
It
was
*NL*
above
the
common
mass
,
above
idleness
,
above
want
,
above
insignificance
.
*NL*
People
came
to
it
in
finery
and
carriages
to
see
.
It
was
ever
a
centre
*NL*
of
light
and
mirth
.
And
here
she
was
of
it
.
Oh
,
if
she
could
only
*NL*
remain
,
how
happy
would
be
her
days
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
said
the
manager
,
who
was
conducting
the
drill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madenda
,
''
she
replied
,
instantly
mindful
of
the
name
Drouet
had
*NL*
selected
in
Chicago
.
``
Carrie
Madenda
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
Miss
Madenda
,
''
he
said
,
very
affably
,
as
Carrie
thought
,
*NL*
``
you
go
over
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
called
to
a
young
woman
who
was
already
of
the
company
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Clark
,
you
pair
with
Miss
Madenda
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
young
lady
stepped
forward
,
so
that
Carrie
saw
where
to
go
,
and
the
*NL*
rehearsal
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
soon
found
that
while
this
drilling
had
some
slight
resemblance
*NL*
to
the
rehearsals
as
conducted
at
Avery
Hall
,
the
attitude
of
the
*NL*
manager
was
much
more
pronounced
.
She
had
marvelled
at
the
insistence
*NL*
and
superior
airs
of
Mr.
Millice
,
but
the
individual
conducting
here
*NL*
had
the
same
insistence
,
coupled
with
almost
brutal
roughness
.
As
the
*NL*
drilling
proceeded
,
he
seemed
to
wax
exceedingly
wroth
over
trifles
,
and
*NL*
to
increase
his
lung
power
in
proportion
.
It
was
very
evident
that
he
*NL*
had
a
great
contempt
for
any
assumption
of
dignity
or
innocence
on
the
*NL*
part
of
these
young
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clark
,
''
he
would
call
--
meaning
,
of
course
,
Miss
Clark
--
``
why
do
n't
you
*NL*
catch
step
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
fours
,
right
!
Right
,
I
said
,
right
!
For
heaven
's
sake
,
get
on
to
*NL*
yourself
!
Right
!
''
and
in
saying
this
he
would
lift
the
last
sounds
into
*NL*
a
vehement
roar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maitland
!
Maitland
!
''
he
called
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
nervous
,
comely-dressed
little
girl
stepped
out
.
Carrie
trembled
for
*NL*
her
out
of
the
fulness
of
her
own
sympathies
and
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Miss
Maitland
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
the
matter
with
your
ears
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
`
column
left
'
means
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
are
you
stumbling
around
the
right
for

Want
to
break
up
the
*NL*
line
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
what
you
were
just
.
Keep
your
ears
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
pitied
,
and
trembled
for
her
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
another
suffered
the
pain
of
personal
rebuke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
a
minute
,
''
cried
the
manager
,
throwing
up
his
hands
,
as
if
in
*NL*
despair
.
His
demeanour
was
fierce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elvers
,
''
he
shouted
,
``
what
have
you
got
in
your
mouth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
Miss
Elvers
,
while
some
smiled
and
stood
nervously
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
you
talking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
keep
your
mouth
still
then
.
Now
,
all
together
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Carrie
's
turn
came
.
It
was
because
of
her
extreme
anxiety
to
do
*NL*
all
that
was
required
that
brought
on
the
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
some
one
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mason
,
''
said
the
voice
.
``
Miss
Mason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
around
to
see
who
it
could
be
.
A
girl
behind
shoved
her
a
*NL*
little
,
but
she
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
you
!
''
said
the
manager
.
``
Ca
n't
you
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Carrie
,
collapsing
,
and
blushing
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
your
name
Mason
?
''
asked
the
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
it
's
Madenda
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
's
the
matter
with
your
feet
?
Ca
n't
you
dance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
had
long
since
learned
this
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
do
it
then
?
Do
n't
go
shuffling
along
as
if
you
were
dead
.
*NL*
I
've
got
to
have
people
with
life
in
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
's
cheek
burned
with
a
crimson
heat
.
Her
lips
trembled
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
constant
urging
,
coupled
with
irascibility
and
energy
,
for
*NL*
three
long
hours
.
Carrie
came
away
worn
enough
in
body
,
but
too
excited
*NL*
in
mind
to
notice
it
.
She
meant
to
go
home
and
practise
her
evolutions
*NL*
as
prescribed
.
She
would
not
err
in
any
way
,
if
she
could
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
reached
the
flat
Hurstwood
was
not
there
.
For
a
wonder
he
was
*NL*
out
looking
for
work
,
as
she
supposed
.
She
took
only
a
mouthful
to
eat
*NL*
and
then
practised
on
,
sustained
by
visions
of
freedom
from
financial
*NL*
distress
--
``
The
sound
of
glory
ringing
in
her
ears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Hurstwood
returned
he
was
not
so
elated
as
when
he
went
away
,
and
*NL*
now
she
was
obliged
to
drop
practice
and
get
dinner
.
Here
was
an
early
*NL*
irritation
.
She
would
have
her
work
and
this
.
Was
she
going
to
act
and
*NL*
keep
house
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
not
do
it
,
''
she
said
,
``
after
I
get
started
.
He
can
take
his
meals
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Each
day
thereafter
brought
its
cares
.
She
found
it
was
not
such
a
*NL*
wonderful
thing
to
be
in
the
chorus
,
and
she
also
learned
that
her
*NL*
salary
would
be
twelve
dollars
a
week
.
After
a
few
days
she
had
*NL*
her
first
sight
of
those
high
and
mighties
--
the
leading
ladies
and
*NL*
gentlemen
.
She
saw
that
they
were
privileged
and
deferred
to
.
She
was
*NL*
nothing
--
absolutely
nothing
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
home
was
Hurstwood
,
daily
giving
her
cause
for
thought
.
He
seemed
to
*NL*
get
nothing
to
do
,
and
yet
he
made
bold
to
inquire
how
she
was
getting
*NL*
along
.
The
regularity
with
which
he
did
this
smacked
of
some
one
who
*NL*
was
waiting
to
live
upon
her
labour
.
Now
that
she
had
a
visible
means
of
*NL*
support
,
this
irritated
her
.
He
seemed
to
be
depending
upon
her
little
*NL*
twelve
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
getting
along
?
''
he
would
blandly
inquire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
all
right
,
''
she
would
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Find
it
easy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
all
right
when
I
get
used
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
paper
would
then
engross
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
some
lard
,
''
he
would
add
,
as
an
afterthought
.
``
I
thought
maybe
*NL*
you
might
want
to
make
some
biscuit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
calm
suggestion
of
the
man
astonished
her
a
little
,
especially
in
*NL*
the
light
of
recent
developments
.
Her
dawning
independence
gave
her
more
*NL*
courage
to
observe
,
and
she
felt
as
if
she
wanted
to
say
things
.
Still
*NL*
she
could
not
talk
to
him
as
she
had
to
Drouet
.
There
was
something
in
*NL*
the
man
's
manner
of
which
she
had
always
stood
in
awe
.
He
seemed
to
have
*NL*
some
invisible
strength
in
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
after
her
first
week
's
rehearsal
,
what
she
expected
came
openly
*NL*
to
the
surface
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
have
to
be
rather
saving
,
''
he
said
,
laying
down
some
meat
he
had
*NL*
purchased
.
``
You
wo
n't
get
any
money
for
a
week
or
so
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
was
stirring
a
pan
at
the
stove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
only
got
the
rent
and
thirteen
dollars
more
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
I
'm
to
use
my
money
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
she
remembered
that
she
had
hoped
to
buy
a
few
things
for
*NL*
herself
.
She
needed
clothes
.
Her
hat
was
not
nice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
twelve
dollars
do
towards
keeping
up
this
flat
?
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
Why
does
n't
he
get
something
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
important
night
of
the
first
real
performance
came
.
She
did
not
*NL*
suggest
to
Hurstwood
that
he
come
and
see
.
He
did
not
think
of
going
.
It
*NL*
would
only
be
money
wasted
.
She
had
such
a
small
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
advertisements
were
already
in
the
papers
;
the
posters
upon
the
*NL*
bill-boards
.
The
leading
lady
and
many
members
were
cited
.
Carrie
was
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
in
Chicago
,
she
was
seized
with
stage
fright
as
the
very
first
*NL*
entrance
of
the
ballet
approached
,
but
later
she
recovered
.
The
apparent
*NL*
and
painful
insignificance
of
the
part
took
fear
away
from
her
.
She
felt
*NL*
that
she
was
so
obscure
it
did
not
matter
.
Fortunately
,
she
did
not
*NL*
have
to
wear
tights
.
A
group
of
twelve
were
assigned
pretty
golden-hued
*NL*
skirts
which
came
only
to
a
line
about
an
inch
above
the
knee
.
Carrie
*NL*
happened
to
be
one
of
the
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
standing
about
the
stage
,
marching
,
and
occasionally
lifting
up
her
*NL*
voice
in
the
general
chorus
,
she
had
a
chance
to
observe
the
audience
*NL*
and
to
see
the
inauguration
of
a
great
hit
.
There
was
plenty
of
*NL*
applause
,
but
she
could
not
help
noting
how
poorly
some
of
the
women
of
*NL*
alleged
ability
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
do
better
than
that
,
''
Carrie
ventured
to
herself
,
in
several
*NL*
instances
.
To
do
her
justice
,
she
was
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
it
was
over
she
dressed
quickly
,
and
as
the
manager
had
*NL*
scolded
some
others
and
passed
her
,
she
imagined
she
must
have
proved
*NL*
satisfactory
.
She
wanted
to
get
out
quickly
,
because
she
knew
but
few
,
*NL*
and
the
stars
were
gossiping
.
Outside
were
carriages
and
some
correct
*NL*
youths
in
attractive
clothing
,
waiting
.
Carrie
saw
that
she
was
scanned
*NL*
closely
.
The
flutter
of
an
eyelash
would
have
brought
her
a
companion
.
*NL*
That
she
did
not
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
experienced
youth
volunteered
,
anyhow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
going
home
alone
,
are
you
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
merely
hastened
her
steps
and
took
the
Sixth
Avenue
car
.
Her
head
*NL*
was
so
full
of
the
wonder
of
it
that
she
had
time
for
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
any
more
from
the
brewery
?
''
she
asked
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
week
,
hoping
by
the
question
to
stir
him
on
to
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
,
``
they
're
not
quite
ready
yet
.
I
think
something
will
*NL*
come
of
that
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
nothing
more
then
,
objecting
to
giving
up
her
own
money
,
and
*NL*
yet
feeling
that
such
would
have
to
be
the
case
.
Hurstwood
felt
the
*NL*
crisis
,
and
artfully
decided
to
appeal
to
Carrie
.
He
had
long
since
*NL*
realised
how
good-natured
she
was
,
how
much
she
would
stand
.
There
was
*NL*
some
little
shame
in
him
at
the
thought
of
doing
so
,
but
he
justified
*NL*
himself
with
the
thought
that
he
really
would
get
something
.
Rent
day
*NL*
gave
him
his
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
counted
it
out
,
``
that
's
about
the
last
of
my
*NL*
money
.
I
'll
have
to
get
something
pretty
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
askance
,
half-suspicious
of
an
appeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
only
hold
out
a
little
longer
I
think
I
could
get
something
.
*NL*
Drake
is
sure
to
open
a
hotel
here
in
September
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
?
''
said
Carrie
,
thinking
of
the
short
month
that
still
remained
*NL*
until
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
mind
helping
me
out
until
then
?
''
he
said
appealingly
.
``
I
*NL*
think
I
'll
be
all
right
after
that
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Carrie
,
feeling
sadly
handicapped
by
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
get
along
if
we
economise
.
I
'll
pay
you
back
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'll
help
you
,
''
said
Carrie
,
feeling
quite
hardhearted
at
thus
*NL*
forcing
him
to
humbly
appeal
,
and
yet
her
desire
for
the
benefit
of
her
*NL*
earnings
wrung
a
faint
protest
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
take
anything
,
George
,
temporarily
?
''
she
said
.
``
What
*NL*
difference
does
it
make
?
Maybe
,
after
a
while
,
you
'll
get
something
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
anything
,
''
he
said
,
relieved
,
and
wincing
under
reproof
.
*NL*
``
I
'd
just
as
leave
dig
on
the
streets
.
Nobody
knows
me
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
need
n't
do
that
,
''
said
Carrie
,
hurt
by
the
pity
of
it
.
``
But
*NL*
there
must
be
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
get
something
!
''
he
said
,
assuming
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
back
to
his
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XXXIX
.
OF
LIGHTS
AND
OF
SHADOWS
--
THE
PARTING
OF
WORLDS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
Hurstwood
got
as
the
result
of
this
determination
was
more
*NL*
self-assurance
that
each
particular
day
was
not
the
day
.
At
the
same
*NL*
time
,
Carrie
passed
through
thirty
days
of
mental
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
need
of
clothes
--
to
say
nothing
of
her
desire
for
ornaments
--
grew
*NL*
rapidly
as
the
fact
developed
that
for
all
her
work
she
was
not
to
have
*NL*
them
.
The
sympathy
she
felt
for
Hurstwood
,
at
the
time
he
asked
her
to
*NL*
tide
him
over
,
vanished
with
these
newer
urgings
of
decency
.
He
was
not
*NL*
always
renewing
his
request
,
but
this
love
of
good
appearance
was
.
It
*NL*
insisted
,
and
Carrie
wished
to
satisfy
it
,
wished
more
and
more
that
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
not
in
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
reasoned
,
when
he
neared
the
last
ten
dollars
,
that
he
had
*NL*
better
keep
a
little
pocket
change
and
not
become
wholly
dependent
for
*NL*
car-fare
,
shaves
,
and
the
like
;
so
when
this
sum
was
still
in
his
hand
*NL*
he
announced
himself
as
penniless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
clear
out
,
''
he
said
to
Carrie
one
afternoon
.
``
I
paid
for
some
coal
*NL*
this
morning
,
and
that
took
all
but
ten
or
fifteen
cents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
some
money
there
in
my
purse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
went
to
get
it
,
starting
for
a
can
of
tomatoes
.
Carrie
*NL*
scarcely
noticed
that
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
new
order
.
He
took
*NL*
out
fifteen
cents
and
bought
the
can
with
it
.
Thereafter
it
was
dribs
*NL*
and
drabs
of
this
sort
,
until
one
morning
Carrie
suddenly
remembered
*NL*
that
she
would
not
be
back
until
close
to
dinner
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
all
out
of
flour
,
''
she
said
;
``
you
'd
better
get
some
this
*NL*
afternoon
.
We
have
n't
any
meat
,
either
.
How
would
it
do
if
we
had
liver
*NL*
and
bacon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suits
me
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
get
a
half
or
three-quarters
of
a
pound
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
'll
be
enough
,
''
volunteered
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
her
purse
and
laid
down
a
half
dollar
.
He
pretended
not
to
*NL*
notice
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
bought
the
flour
--
which
all
grocers
sold
in
3 1/2
-
pound
*NL*
packages
--
for
thirteen
cents
and
paid
fifteen
cents
for
a
half-pound
*NL*
of
liver
and
bacon
.
He
left
the
packages
,
together
with
the
balance
of
*NL*
twenty-two
cents
,
upon
the
kitchen
table
,
where
Carrie
found
it
.
It
did
*NL*
not
escape
her
that
the
change
was
accurate
.
There
was
something
sad
in
*NL*
realising
that
,
after
all
,
all
that
he
wanted
of
her
was
something
*NL*
to
eat
.
She
felt
as
if
hard
thoughts
were
unjust
.
Maybe
he
would
get
*NL*
something
yet
.
He
had
no
vices
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
very
evening
,
however
,
on
going
into
the
theatre
,
one
of
the
chorus
*NL*
girls
passed
her
all
newly
arrayed
in
a
pretty
mottled
tweed
suit
,
which
*NL*
took
Carrie
's
eye
.
The
young
woman
wore
a
fine
bunch
of
violets
and
*NL*
seemed
in
high
spirits
.
She
smiled
at
Carrie
good-naturedly
as
she
*NL*
passed
,
showing
pretty
,
even
teeth
,
and
Carrie
smiled
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
can
afford
to
dress
well
,
''
thought
Carrie
,
``
and
so
could
I
,
if
I
*NL*
could
only
keep
my
money
.
I
have
n't
a
decent
tie
of
any
kind
to
wear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
out
her
foot
and
looked
at
her
shoe
reflectively
.
``
I
'll
get
a
*NL*
pair
of
shoes
Saturday
,
anyhow
;
I
do
n't
care
what
happens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
sweetest
and
most
sympathetic
little
chorus
girls
in
the
*NL*
company
made
friends
with
her
because
in
Carrie
she
found
nothing
to
*NL*
frighten
her
away
.
She
was
a
gay
little
Manon
,
unwitting
of
society
's
*NL*
fierce
conception
of
morality
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
good
to
her
neighbour
*NL*
and
charitable
.
Little
license
was
allowed
the
chorus
in
the
matter
of
*NL*
conversation
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
some
was
indulged
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
warm
to-night
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
this
girl
,
arrayed
in
pink
*NL*
fleshings
and
an
imitation
golden
helmet
.
She
also
carried
a
shining
*NL*
shield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
is
,
''
said
Carrie
,
pleased
that
some
one
should
talk
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
almost
roasting
,
''
said
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
into
her
pretty
face
,
with
its
large
blue
eyes
,
and
saw
*NL*
little
beads
of
moisture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
more
marching
in
this
opera
than
ever
I
did
before
,
''
added
the
*NL*
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
in
others
?
''
asked
Carrie
,
surprised
at
her
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lots
of
them
,
''
said
the
girl
;
``
have
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
first
experience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
it
?
I
thought
I
saw
you
the
time
they
ran
`
The
Queen
's
Mate
'
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Carrie
,
shaking
her
head
;
``
not
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
blare
of
the
orchestra
and
the
*NL*
sputtering
of
the
calcium
lights
in
the
wings
as
the
line
was
called
*NL*
to
form
for
a
new
entrance
.
No
further
opportunity
for
conversation
*NL*
occurred
,
but
the
next
evening
,
when
they
were
getting
ready
for
the
*NL*
stage
,
this
girl
appeared
anew
at
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
this
show
is
going
on
the
road
next
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
do
you
think
you
'll
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
I
guess
so
,
if
they
'll
take
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
'll
take
you
.
I
would
n't
go
.
They
wo
n't
give
you
any
more
,
and
*NL*
it
will
cost
you
everything
you
make
to
live
.
I
never
leave
New
York
.
*NL*
There
are
too
many
shows
going
on
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
always
get
in
another
show
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
have
.
There
's
one
going
on
up
at
the
Broadway
this
month
.
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
try
and
get
in
that
if
this
one
really
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
heard
this
with
aroused
intelligence
.
Evidently
it
was
n't
so
very
*NL*
difficult
to
get
on
.
Maybe
she
also
could
get
a
place
if
this
show
went
*NL*
away
.
``
Do
they
all
pay
about
the
same
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Sometimes
you
get
a
little
more
.
This
show
does
n't
pay
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
get
twelve
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
''
said
the
girl
.
``
They
pay
me
fifteen
,
and
you
do
more
work
than
*NL*
I
do
.
I
would
n't
stand
it
if
I
were
you
.
They
're
just
giving
you
less
*NL*
because
they
think
you
do
n't
know
.
You
ought
to
be
making
fifteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
not
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'll
get
more
at
the
next
place
if
you
want
it
,
''
went
on
the
*NL*
girl
,
who
admired
Carrie
very
much
.
``
You
do
fine
,
and
the
manager
knows
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
Carrie
did
unconsciously
move
about
with
an
air
*NL*
pleasing
and
somewhat
distinctive
.
It
was
due
wholly
to
her
natural
*NL*
manner
and
total
lack
of
self-consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
I
could
get
more
up
at
the
Broadway
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
can
,
''
answered
the
girl
.
``
You
come
with
me
when
I
go
.
*NL*
I
'll
do
the
talking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
heard
this
,
flushing
with
thankfulness
.
She
liked
this
little
*NL*
gaslight
soldier
.
She
seemed
so
experienced
and
self-reliant
in
her
*NL*
tinsel
helmet
and
military
accoutrements
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
future
must
be
assured
if
I
can
always
get
work
this
way
,
''
thought
*NL*
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
in
the
morning
,
when
her
household
duties
would
infringe
upon
her
*NL*
and
Hurstwood
sat
there
,
a
perfect
load
to
contemplate
,
her
fate
seemed
*NL*
dismal
and
unrelieved
.
It
did
not
take
so
very
much
to
feed
them
under
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
close-measured
buying
,
and
there
would
possibly
be
enough
*NL*
for
rent
,
but
it
left
nothing
else
.
Carrie
bought
the
shoes
and
some
*NL*
other
things
,
which
complicated
the
rent
problem
very
seriously
.
*NL*
Suddenly
,
a
week
from
the
fatal
day
,
Carrie
realised
that
they
were
*NL*
going
to
run
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
looking
into
her
purse
at
breakfast
,
*NL*
``
that
I
'll
have
enough
to
pay
the
rent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
have
you
?
''
inquired
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
got
twenty-two
dollars
,
but
there
's
everything
to
be
paid
*NL*
for
this
week
yet
,
and
if
I
use
all
I
get
Saturday
to
pay
this
,
there
*NL*
wo
n't
be
any
left
for
next
week
.
Do
you
think
your
hotel
man
will
open
*NL*
his
hotel
this
month
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
''
returned
Hurstwood
.
``
He
said
he
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
,
Hurstwood
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
worry
about
it
.
Maybe
the
grocer
will
wait
.
He
can
do
that
.
We
've
*NL*
traded
there
long
enough
to
make
him
trust
us
for
a
week
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
he
will
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
.
''
On
this
account
,
Hurstwood
,
this
very
day
,
looked
grocer
*NL*
Oeslogge
clearly
in
the
eye
as
he
ordered
a
pound
of
coffee
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mind
carrying
my
account
until
the
end
of
every
week
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Mr.
Wheeler
,
''
said
Mr.
Oeslogge
.
``
Dat
iss
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
still
tactful
in
distress
,
added
nothing
to
this
.
It
seemed
*NL*
an
easy
thing
.
He
looked
out
of
the
door
,
and
then
gathered
up
his
*NL*
coffee
when
ready
and
came
away
.
The
game
of
a
desperate
man
had
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rent
was
paid
,
and
now
came
the
grocer
.
Hurstwood
managed
by
paying
out
*NL*
of
his
own
ten
and
collecting
from
Carrie
at
the
end
of
the
week
.
Then
*NL*
he
delayed
a
day
next
time
settling
with
the
grocer
,
and
so
soon
had
his
*NL*
ten
back
,
with
Oeslogge
getting
his
pay
on
this
Thursday
or
Friday
for
*NL*
last
Saturday
's
bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
entanglement
made
Carrie
anxious
for
a
change
of
some
sort
.
*NL*
Hurstwood
did
not
seem
to
realise
that
she
had
a
right
to
anything
.
He
*NL*
schemed
to
make
what
she
earned
cover
all
expenses
,
but
seemed
not
to
*NL*
trouble
over
adding
anything
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
talks
about
worrying
,
''
thought
Carrie
.
``
If
he
worried
enough
he
*NL*
could
n't
sit
there
and
wait
for
me
.
He
'd
get
something
to
do
.
No
man
*NL*
could
go
seven
months
without
finding
something
if
he
tried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
of
him
always
around
in
his
untidy
clothes
and
gloomy
*NL*
appearance
drove
Carrie
to
seek
relief
in
other
places
.
Twice
a
week
*NL*
there
were
matinees
,
and
then
Hurstwood
ate
a
cold
snack
,
which
he
*NL*
prepared
himself
.
Two
other
days
there
were
rehearsals
beginning
at
ten
*NL*
in
the
morning
and
lasting
usually
until
one
.
Now
,
to
this
Carrie
added
*NL*
a
few
visits
to
one
or
two
chorus
girls
,
including
the
blue-eyed
soldier
*NL*
of
the
golden
helmet
.
She
did
it
because
it
was
pleasant
and
a
relief
*NL*
from
dulness
of
the
home
over
which
her
husband
brooded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blue-eyed
soldier
's
name
was
Osborne
--
Lola
Osborne
.
Her
room
was
*NL*
in
Nineteenth
Street
near
Fourth
Avenue
,
a
block
now
given
up
wholly
to
*NL*
office
buildings
.
Here
she
had
a
comfortable
back
room
,
looking
over
a
*NL*
collection
of
back
yards
in
which
grew
a
number
of
shade
trees
pleasant
*NL*
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
your
home
in
New
York
?
''
she
asked
of
Lola
one
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
ca
n't
get
along
with
my
people
.
They
always
want
me
to
do
*NL*
what
they
want
.
Do
you
live
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
your
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
ashamed
to
say
that
she
was
married
.
She
had
talked
so
much
*NL*
about
getting
more
salary
and
confessed
to
so
much
anxiety
about
her
*NL*
future
,
that
now
,
when
the
direct
question
of
fact
was
waiting
,
she
*NL*
could
not
tell
this
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
some
relatives
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Osborne
took
it
for
granted
that
,
like
herself
,
Carrie
's
time
was
*NL*
her
own
.
She
invariably
asked
her
to
stay
,
proposing
little
outings
*NL*
and
other
things
of
that
sort
until
Carrie
began
neglecting
her
dinner
*NL*
hours
.
Hurstwood
noticed
it
,
but
felt
in
no
position
to
quarrel
with
*NL*
her
.
Several
times
she
came
so
late
as
scarcely
to
have
an
hour
in
which
*NL*
to
patch
up
a
meal
and
start
for
the
theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
rehearse
in
the
afternoons
?
''
Hurstwood
once
asked
,
concealing
*NL*
almost
completely
the
cynical
protest
and
regret
which
prompted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
was
looking
around
for
another
place
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
she
was
,
but
only
in
such
a
way
as
furnished
the
*NL*
least
straw
of
an
excuse
.
Miss
Osborne
and
she
had
gone
to
the
office
*NL*
of
the
manager
who
was
to
produce
the
new
opera
at
the
Broadway
and
*NL*
returned
straight
to
the
former
's
room
,
where
they
had
been
since
three
*NL*
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
felt
this
question
to
be
an
infringement
on
her
liberty
.
She
did
*NL*
not
take
into
account
how
much
liberty
she
was
securing
.
Only
the
latest
*NL*
step
,
the
newest
freedom
,
must
not
be
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
saw
it
all
clearly
enough
.
He
was
shrewd
after
his
kind
,
and
*NL*
yet
there
was
enough
decency
in
the
man
to
stop
him
from
making
any
*NL*
effectual
protest
.
In
his
almost
inexplicable
apathy
he
was
content
*NL*
to
droop
supinely
while
Carrie
drifted
out
of
his
life
,
just
as
he
was
*NL*
willing
supinely
to
see
opportunity
pass
beyond
his
control
.
He
could
*NL*
not
help
clinging
and
protesting
in
a
mild
,
irritating
,
and
ineffectual
*NL*
way
,
however
--
a
way
that
simply
widened
the
breach
by
slow
degrees
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
further
enlargement
of
this
chasm
between
them
came
when
the
manager
,
*NL*
looking
between
the
wings
upon
the
brightly
lighted
stage
where
the
*NL*
chorus
was
going
through
some
of
its
glittering
evolutions
,
said
to
the
*NL*
master
of
the
ballet
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
fourth
girl
there
on
the
right
--
the
one
coming
round
at
the
*NL*
end
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
the
ballet-master
,
``
that
's
Miss
Madenda
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
good
looking
.
Why
do
n't
you
let
her
head
that
line
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
do
that
.
She
'll
look
better
there
than
the
woman
you
've
got
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
I
will
do
that
,
''
said
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
evening
Carrie
was
called
out
,
much
as
if
for
an
error
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
lead
your
company
to
night
,
''
said
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
snap
into
it
,
''
he
added
.
``
We
must
have
snap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
replied
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Astonished
at
this
change
,
she
thought
that
the
heretofore
leader
must
*NL*
be
ill
;
but
when
she
saw
her
in
the
line
,
with
a
distinct
expression
of
*NL*
something
unfavourable
in
her
eye
,
she
began
to
think
that
perhaps
it
*NL*
was
merit
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
chic
way
of
tossing
her
head
to
one
side
,
and
holding
her
arms
*NL*
as
if
for
action
--
not
listlessly
.
In
front
of
the
line
this
showed
up
*NL*
even
more
effectually
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
girl
knows
how
to
carry
herself
,
''
said
the
manager
,
another
*NL*
evening
.
He
began
to
think
that
he
should
like
to
talk
with
her
.
If
*NL*
he
had
n't
made
it
a
rule
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
members
of
the
*NL*
chorus
,
he
would
have
approached
her
most
unbendingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
that
girl
at
the
head
of
the
white
column
,
''
he
suggested
to
the
man
*NL*
in
charge
of
the
ballet
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
white
column
consisted
of
some
twenty
girls
,
all
in
snow-white
*NL*
flannel
trimmed
with
silver
and
blue
.
Its
leader
was
most
stunningly
*NL*
arrayed
in
the
same
colours
,
elaborated
,
however
,
with
epaulets
and
*NL*
a
belt
of
silver
,
with
a
short
sword
dangling
at
one
side
.
Carrie
was
*NL*
fitted
for
this
costume
,
and
a
few
days
later
appeared
,
proud
of
her
new
*NL*
laurels
.
She
was
especially
gratified
to
find
that
her
salary
was
now
*NL*
eighteen
instead
of
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
heard
nothing
about
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
not
give
him
the
rest
of
my
money
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
do
enough
.
I
*NL*
am
going
to
get
me
something
to
wear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
during
this
second
month
she
had
been
buying
for
*NL*
herself
as
recklessly
as
she
dared
,
regardless
of
the
consequences
.
*NL*
There
were
impending
more
complications
rent
day
,
and
more
extension
of
*NL*
the
credit
system
in
the
neighbourhood
.
Now
,
however
,
she
proposed
to
do
*NL*
better
by
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
first
move
was
to
buy
a
shirt
waist
,
and
in
studying
these
she
found
*NL*
how
little
her
money
would
buy
--
how
much
,
if
she
could
only
use
all
.
*NL*
She
forgot
that
if
she
were
alone
she
would
have
to
pay
for
a
room
and
*NL*
board
,
and
imagined
that
every
cent
of
her
eighteen
could
be
spent
for
*NL*
clothes
and
things
that
she
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
she
picked
upon
something
,
which
not
only
used
up
all
her
*NL*
surplus
above
twelve
,
but
invaded
that
sum
.
She
knew
she
was
going
too
*NL*
far
,
but
her
feminine
love
of
finery
prevailed
.
The
next
day
Hurstwood
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
owe
the
grocer
five
dollars
and
forty
cents
this
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
we
?
''
said
Carrie
,
frowning
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
in
her
purse
to
leave
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
only
got
eight
dollars
and
twenty
cents
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
owe
the
milkman
sixty
cents
,
''
added
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
there
's
the
coal
man
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
said
nothing
.
He
had
seen
the
new
things
she
was
buying
;
the
*NL*
way
she
was
neglecting
household
duties
;
the
readiness
with
which
she
*NL*
was
slipping
out
afternoons
and
staying
.
He
felt
that
something
was
*NL*
going
to
happen
.
All
at
once
she
spoke
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
;
``
I
ca
n't
do
it
all
.
I
do
n't
earn
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
direct
challenge
.
Hurstwood
had
to
take
it
up
.
He
tried
to
be
*NL*
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
do
it
all
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
only
want
a
little
help
*NL*
until
I
can
get
something
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
``
That
's
always
the
way
.
It
takes
more
than
I
*NL*
can
earn
to
pay
for
things
.
I
do
n't
see
what
I
'm
going
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
tried
to
get
something
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
What
do
you
want
me
*NL*
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
have
tried
so
very
hard
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
got
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
,
''
he
said
,
angered
almost
to
harsh
words
.
``
You
need
n't
*NL*
throw
up
your
success
to
me
.
All
I
asked
was
a
little
help
until
I
could
*NL*
get
something
.
I
'm
not
down
yet
.
I
'll
come
up
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
to
speak
steadily
,
but
his
voice
trembled
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
's
anger
melted
on
the
instant
.
She
felt
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
``
here
's
the
money
,
''
and
emptied
it
out
on
the
table
.
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
got
quite
enough
to
pay
it
all
.
If
they
can
wait
until
*NL*
Saturday
,
though
,
I
'll
have
some
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
keep
it
,
''
said
Hurstwood
sadly
.
``
I
only
want
enough
to
pay
the
*NL*
grocer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
it
back
,
and
proceeded
to
get
dinner
early
and
in
good
time
.
Her
*NL*
little
bravado
made
her
feel
as
if
she
ought
to
make
amends
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
little
while
their
old
thoughts
returned
to
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
making
more
than
she
says
,
''
thought
Hurstwood
.
``
She
says
she
's
*NL*
making
twelve
,
but
that
would
n't
buy
all
those
things
.
I
do
n't
care
.
Let
*NL*
her
keep
her
money
.
I
'll
get
something
again
one
of
these
days
.
Then
she
*NL*
can
go
to
the
deuce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
said
this
in
his
anger
,
but
it
prefigured
a
possible
course
of
*NL*
action
and
attitude
well
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
,
''
thought
Carrie
.
``
He
ought
to
be
told
to
get
out
and
do
*NL*
something
.
It
is
n't
right
that
I
should
support
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
these
days
Carrie
was
introduced
to
several
youths
,
friends
of
Miss
*NL*
Osborne
,
who
were
of
the
kind
most
aptly
described
as
gay
and
festive
.
*NL*
They
called
once
to
get
Miss
Osborne
for
an
afternoon
drive
.
Carrie
was
*NL*
with
her
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
go
along
,
''
said
Lola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
come
and
go
.
What
have
you
got
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
to
be
home
by
five
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
take
us
to
dinner
,
''
said
Lola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
wo
n't
go
.
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
come
.
They
're
awful
nice
boys
.
We
'll
get
you
back
in
time
.
We
're
*NL*
only
going
for
a
drive
in
Central
Park
.
''
Carrie
thought
a
while
,
and
at
*NL*
last
yielded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
must
be
back
by
half-past
four
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
information
went
in
one
ear
of
Lola
and
out
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Drouet
and
Hurstwood
,
there
was
the
least
touch
of
cynicism
in
her
*NL*
attitude
toward
young
men
--
especially
of
the
gay
and
frivolous
sort
.
She
*NL*
felt
a
little
older
than
they
.
Some
of
their
pretty
compliments
seemed
*NL*
silly
.
Still
,
she
was
young
in
heart
and
body
and
youth
appealed
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
'll
be
right
back
,
Miss
Madenda
,
''
said
one
of
the
chaps
,
bowing
.
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
think
we
'd
keep
you
over
time
,
now
,
would
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Carrie
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
off
for
a
drive
--
she
,
looking
about
and
noticing
fine
*NL*
clothing
,
the
young
men
voicing
those
silly
pleasantries
and
weak
quips
*NL*
which
pass
for
humour
in
coy
circles
.
Carrie
saw
the
great
park
parade
*NL*
of
carriages
,
beginning
at
the
Fifty-ninth
Street
entrance
and
winding
*NL*
past
the
Museum
of
Art
to
the
exit
at
One
Hundred
and
Tenth
Street
and
*NL*
Seventh
Avenue
.
Her
eye
was
once
more
taken
by
the
show
of
wealth
--
the
*NL*
elaborate
costumes
,
elegant
harnesses
,
spirited
horses
,
and
,
above
all
,
*NL*
the
beauty
.
Once
more
the
plague
of
poverty
galled
her
,
but
now
she
*NL*
forgot
in
a
measure
her
own
troubles
so
far
as
to
forget
Hurstwood
.
He
*NL*
waited
until
four
,
five
,
and
even
six
.
It
was
getting
dark
when
he
got
*NL*
up
out
of
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
she
is
n't
coming
home
,
''
he
said
,
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
,
''
he
thought
.
``
She
's
getting
a
start
now
.
I
'm
out
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
really
discovered
her
neglect
,
but
only
at
a
quarter
after
*NL*
five
,
and
the
open
carriage
was
now
far
up
Seventh
Avenue
,
near
the
*NL*
Harlem
River
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
is
it
?
''
she
inquired
.
``
I
must
be
getting
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
quarter
after
five
,
''
said
her
companion
,
consulting
an
elegant
,
*NL*
open-faced
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
!
''
exclaimed
Carrie
.
Then
she
settled
back
with
a
sigh
.
*NL*
``
There
's
no
use
crying
over
spilt
milk
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
,
''
said
the
youth
,
who
saw
visions
of
a
fine
dinner
now
,
*NL*
and
such
invigorating
talk
as
would
result
in
a
reunion
after
the
show
.
*NL*
He
was
greatly
taken
with
Carrie
.
``
We
'll
drive
down
to
Delmonico
's
now
*NL*
and
have
something
there
,
wo
n't
we
,
Orrin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
''
replied
Orrin
,
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
thought
of
Hurstwood
.
Never
before
had
she
neglected
dinner
*NL*
without
an
excuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
back
,
and
at
6.15
sat
down
to
dine
.
It
was
the
Sherry
*NL*
incident
over
again
,
the
remembrance
of
which
came
painfully
back
to
*NL*
Carrie
.
She
remembered
Mrs.
Vance
,
who
had
never
called
again
after
*NL*
Hurstwood
's
reception
,
and
Ames
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
figure
her
mind
halted
.
It
was
a
strong
,
clean
vision
.
He
liked
*NL*
better
books
than
she
read
,
better
people
than
she
associated
with
.
His
*NL*
ideals
burned
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
fine
to
be
a
good
actress
,
''
came
distinctly
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
sort
of
an
actress
was
she
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
about
,
Miss
Madenda
?
''
inquired
her
merry
*NL*
companion
.
``
Come
,
now
,
let
's
see
if
I
can
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
Do
n't
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
it
off
and
ate
.
She
forgot
,
in
part
,
and
was
merry
.
When
it
*NL*
came
to
the
after-theatre
proposition
,
however
,
she
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
ca
n't
.
I
have
a
previous
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
now
,
Miss
Madenda
,
''
pleaded
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
I
ca
n't
.
You
've
been
so
kind
,
but
you
'll
have
to
*NL*
excuse
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
youth
looked
exceedingly
crestfallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cheer
up
,
old
man
,
''
whispered
his
companion
.
``
We
'll
go
around
,
anyhow
.
*NL*
She
may
change
her
mind
.

Chapter
XL

A
PUBLIC
DISSENSION
--
A
FINAL
APPEAL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
after-theatre
lark
,
however
,
so
far
as
Carrie
was
*NL*
concerned
.
She
made
her
way
homeward
,
thinking
about
her
absence
.
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
asleep
,
but
roused
up
to
look
as
she
passed
through
to
her
*NL*
own
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
at
breakfast
she
felt
like
apologising
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
get
home
last
evening
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Carrie
,
''
he
answered
,
``
what
's
the
use
saying
that
?
I
do
n't
care
.
*NL*
You
need
n't
tell
me
that
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
,
her
colour
rising
.
Then
,
seeing
that
he
*NL*
looked
as
if
he
said
``
I
know
,
''
she
exclaimed
:
``
Oh
,
all
right
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
now
on
,
her
indifference
to
the
flat
was
even
greater
.
There
*NL*
seemed
no
common
ground
on
which
they
could
talk
to
one
another
.
She
let
*NL*
herself
be
asked
for
expenses
.
It
became
so
with
him
that
he
hated
to
do
*NL*
it
.
He
preferred
standing
off
the
butcher
and
baker
.
He
ran
up
a
grocery
*NL*
bill
of
sixteen
dollars
with
Oeslogge
,
laying
in
a
supply
of
staple
*NL*
articles
,
so
that
they
would
not
have
to
buy
any
of
those
things
for
*NL*
some
time
to
come
.
Then
he
changed
his
grocery
.
It
was
the
same
with
the
*NL*
butcher
and
several
others
.
Carrie
never
heard
anything
of
this
directly
*NL*
from
him
.
He
asked
for
such
as
he
could
expect
,
drifting
farther
and
*NL*
farther
into
a
situation
which
could
have
but
one
ending
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
fashion
,
September
went
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
Mr.
Drake
going
to
open
his
hotel
?
''
Carrie
asked
several
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
He
wo
n't
do
it
before
October
,
though
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
became
disgusted
.
``
Such
a
man
,
''
she
said
to
herself
frequently
.
*NL*
More
and
more
she
visited
.
She
put
most
of
her
spare
money
in
clothes
,
*NL*
which
,
after
all
,
was
not
an
astonishing
amount
.
At
last
the
opera
she
*NL*
was
with
announced
its
departure
within
four
weeks
.
``
Last
two
weeks
of
*NL*
the
Great
Comic
Opera
success
--
The
--------
,
''
etc.
,
was
upon
all
*NL*
billboards
and
in
the
newspapers
,
before
she
acted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
going
out
on
the
road
,
''
said
Miss
Osborne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
went
with
her
to
apply
to
another
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ever
had
any
experience
?
''
was
one
of
his
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
with
the
company
at
the
Casino
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
end
of
this
was
another
engagement
at
twenty
per
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
delighted
.
She
began
to
feel
that
she
had
a
place
in
the
*NL*
world
.
People
recognised
ability
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
changed
was
her
state
that
the
home
atmosphere
became
intolerable
.
*NL*
It
was
all
poverty
and
trouble
there
,
or
seemed
to
be
,
because
it
was
*NL*
a
load
to
bear
.
It
became
a
place
to
keep
away
from
.
Still
she
slept
*NL*
there
,
and
did
a
fair
amount
of
work
,
keeping
it
in
order
.
It
was
*NL*
a
sitting
place
for
Hurstwood
.
He
sat
and
rocked
,
rocked
and
read
,
*NL*
enveloped
in
the
gloom
of
his
own
fate
.
October
went
by
,
and
November
.
*NL*
It
was
the
dead
of
winter
almost
before
he
knew
it
,
and
there
he
sat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
doing
better
,
that
he
knew
.
Her
clothes
were
improved
now
,
*NL*
even
fine
.
He
saw
her
coming
and
going
,
sometimes
picturing
to
himself
*NL*
her
rise
.
Little
eating
had
thinned
him
somewhat
.
He
had
no
appetite
.
*NL*
His
clothes
,
too
,
were
a
poor
man
's
clothes
.
Talk
about
getting
*NL*
something
had
become
even
too
threadbare
and
ridiculous
for
him
.
So
he
*NL*
folded
his
hands
and
waited
--
for
what
,
he
could
not
anticipate
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
however
,
troubles
became
too
thick
.
The
hounding
of
creditors
,
*NL*
the
indifference
of
Carrie
,
the
silence
of
the
flat
,
and
presence
of
*NL*
winter
,
all
joined
to
produce
a
climax
.
It
was
effected
by
the
arrival
*NL*
of
Oeslogge
,
personally
,
when
Carrie
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
call
about
my
bill
,
''
said
Mr.
Oeslogge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
only
faintly
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
is
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixteen
dollars
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
much
?
''
said
Carrie
.
``
Is
this
right
?
''
she
asked
,
turning
to
*NL*
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
never
heard
anything
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
as
if
she
thought
he
had
been
contracting
some
needless
*NL*
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
had
it
all
right
,
''
he
answered
.
Then
he
went
to
the
door
.
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
pay
you
anything
on
that
to-day
,
''
he
said
,
mildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
can
you
?
''
said
the
grocer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
before
Saturday
,
anyhow
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
!
''
returned
the
grocer
.
``
This
is
fine
.
I
must
have
that
.
I
need
the
*NL*
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
standing
farther
back
in
the
room
,
hearing
it
all
.
She
was
*NL*
greatly
distressed
.
It
was
so
bad
and
commonplace
.
Hurstwood
was
annoyed
*NL*
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
there
's
no
use
talking
about
it
now
.
If
you
'll
come
in
*NL*
Saturday
,
I
'll
pay
you
something
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grocery
man
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
we
going
to
pay
it
?
''
asked
Carrie
,
astonished
by
the
bill
.
``
I
*NL*
ca
n't
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
do
n't
have
to
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
ca
n't
get
what
he
ca
n't
get
.
*NL*
He
'll
have
to
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
how
we
ran
up
such
a
bill
as
that
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
ate
it
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
funny
,
''
she
replied
,
still
doubting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
of
your
standing
there
and
talking
like
that
,
now
?
''
*NL*
he
asked
.
``
Do
you
think
I
've
had
it
alone
?
You
talk
as
if
I
'd
taken
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
too
much
,
anyhow
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
ought
n't
to
be
made
to
*NL*
pay
for
it
.
I
've
got
more
than
I
can
pay
for
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
replied
Hurstwood
,
sitting
down
in
silence
.
He
was
sick
of
*NL*
the
grind
of
this
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
went
out
and
there
he
sat
,
determining
to
do
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
had
been
appearing
in
the
papers
about
this
time
rumours
and
*NL*
notices
of
an
approaching
strike
on
the
trolley
lines
in
Brooklyn
.
There
*NL*
was
general
dissatisfaction
as
to
the
hours
of
labour
required
and
the
*NL*
wages
paid
.
As
usual
--
and
for
some
inexplicable
reason
--
the
men
chose
*NL*
the
winter
for
the
forcing
of
the
hand
of
their
employers
and
the
*NL*
settlement
of
their
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
had
been
reading
of
this
thing
,
and
wondering
concerning
the
*NL*
huge
tie-up
which
would
follow
.
A
day
or
two
before
this
trouble
with
*NL*
Carrie
,
it
came
.
On
a
cold
afternoon
,
when
everything
was
grey
and
it
*NL*
threatened
to
snow
,
the
papers
announced
that
the
men
had
been
called
*NL*
out
on
all
the
lines
.
Being
so
utterly
idle
,
and
his
mind
filled
with
*NL*
the
numerous
predictions
which
had
been
made
concerning
the
scarcity
*NL*
of
labour
this
winter
and
the
panicky
state
of
the
financial
market
,
*NL*
Hurstwood
read
this
with
interest
.
He
noted
the
claims
of
the
striking
*NL*
motormen
and
conductors
,
who
said
that
they
had
been
wont
to
receive
two
*NL*
dollars
a
day
in
times
past
,
but
that
for
a
year
or
more
``
trippers
''
had
*NL*
been
introduced
,
which
cut
down
their
chance
of
livelihood
one-half
,
*NL*
and
increased
their
hours
of
servitude
from
ten
to
twelve
,
and
even
*NL*
fourteen
.
These
``
trippers
''
were
men
put
on
during
the
busy
and
rush
*NL*
hours
,
to
take
a
car
out
for
one
trip
.
The
compensation
paid
for
such
a
*NL*
trip
was
only
twenty-five
cents
.
When
the
rush
or
busy
hours
were
over
,
*NL*
they
were
laid
off
.
Worst
of
all
,
no
man
might
know
when
he
was
going
to
*NL*
get
a
car
.
He
must
come
to
the
barns
in
the
morning
and
wait
around
in
*NL*
fair
and
foul
weather
until
such
time
as
he
was
needed
.
Two
trips
were
*NL*
an
average
reward
for
so
much
waiting
--
a
little
over
three
hours
'
work
*NL*
for
fifty
cents
.
The
work
of
waiting
was
not
counted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
complained
that
this
system
was
extending
,
and
that
the
time
*NL*
was
not
far
off
when
but
a
few
out
of
7,000
employees
would
have
*NL*
regular
two-dollar-a-day
work
at
all
.
They
demanded
that
the
system
*NL*
be
abolished
,
and
that
ten
hours
be
considered
a
day
's
work
,
barring
*NL*
unavoidable
delays
,
with
$
2.25
pay
.
They
demanded
immediate
acceptance
*NL*
of
these
terms
,
which
the
various
trolley
companies
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
at
first
sympathised
with
the
demands
of
these
men
--
indeed
,
it
*NL*
is
a
question
whether
he
did
not
always
sympathise
with
them
to
the
*NL*
end
,
belie
him
as
his
actions
might
.
Reading
nearly
all
the
news
,
he
was
*NL*
attracted
first
by
the
scare-heads
with
which
the
trouble
was
noted
*NL*
in
the
``
World
.
''
He
read
it
fully
--
the
names
of
the
seven
companies
*NL*
involved
,
the
number
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
foolish
to
strike
in
this
sort
of
weather
,
''
he
thought
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
Let
'em
win
if
they
can
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
there
was
even
a
larger
notice
of
it
.
``
Brooklynites
Walk
,
''
*NL*
said
the
``
World
.
''
``
Knights
of
Labour
Tie
up
the
Trolley
Lines
Across
the
*NL*
Bridge
.
''
``
About
Seven
Thousand
Men
Out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
read
this
,
formulating
to
himself
his
own
idea
of
what
would
*NL*
be
the
outcome
.
He
was
a
great
believer
in
the
strength
of
corporations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ca
n't
win
,
''
he
said
,
concerning
the
men
.
``
They
have
n't
any
money
.
*NL*
The
police
will
protect
the
companies
.
They
've
got
to
.
The
public
has
to
*NL*
have
its
cars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
n't
sympathise
with
the
corporations
,
but
strength
was
with
them
.
*NL*
So
was
property
and
public
utility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
fellows
ca
n't
win
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
things
,
he
noticed
a
circular
issued
by
one
of
the
*NL*
companies
,
which
read
:

also
noted

one

read

;

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
noted
particularly
in
each
the
``
protection
guaranteed
.
''
It
signified
*NL*
to
him
the
unassailable
power
of
the
companies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
got
the

''
he
thought
.
``
There

*NL*
anything

''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
still
in
his
mind
,
the
incident
with
Oeslogge
and
Carrie
*NL*
occurred
.
There
had
been
a
good
deal
to
irritate
him
,
but
this
seemed
*NL*
much
the
worst
.
Never
before
had
she
accused
him
of
stealing
--
or
very
*NL*
near
that
.
She
doubted
the
naturalness
of
so
large
a
bill
.
And
he
had
*NL*
worked
so
hard
to
make
expenses
seem
light
.
He
had
been
``
doing
''
butcher
*NL*
and
baker
in
order
not
to
call
on
her
.
He
had
eaten
very
little
--
almost
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
all
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
can
get
something
.
I
'm
not
down
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
that
he
really
must
do
something
now
.
It
was
too
cheap
to
sit
*NL*
around
after
such
an
insinuation
as
this
.
Why
,
after
a
little
,
he
would
*NL*
be
standing
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
looked
out
the
window
into
the
chilly
street
.
It
came
*NL*
gradually
into
his
mind
,
as
he
stood
there
,
to
go
to
Brooklyn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
his
mind
said
.
``
Any
one
can
get
work
over
there
.
You
'll
get
*NL*
two
a
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
accidents

''
said
a
voice
.
``
You
might
get
hurt

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
wo
n't
be
much
of
that

''
he
answered
.
``
They
've
called
out
the
*NL*
police

''
rejoined
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
apply
as
a
motorman
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
can
ring
up
fares
all
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
want
motormen
,
mostly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
take
anybody
;
that
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
hours
he
argued
pro
and
con
with
this
mental
counsellor
,
*NL*
feeling
no
need
to
act
at
once
in
a
matter
so
sure
of
profit
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
he
put
on
his
best
clothes
,
which
were
poor
enough
,
*NL*
and
began
stirring
about
,
putting
some
bread
and
meat
into
a
page
of
a
*NL*
newspaper
.
Carrie
watched
him
,
interested
in
this
new
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Over
to
Brooklyn
,
''
he
answered
.
Then
,
seeing
her
still
inquisitive
,
he
*NL*
added
:
``
I
think
I
can
get
on
over
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
trolley
lines
?
''
said
Carrie
,
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
rejoined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
afraid
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
?
''
he
answered
.
``
The
police
are
protecting
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
paper
said
four
men
were
hurt
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
returned
;
``
but
you
ca
n't
go
by
what
the
papers
say
.
They
'll
*NL*
run
the
cars
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
rather
determined
now
,
in
a
desolate
sort
of
way
,
and
Carrie
*NL*
felt
very
sorry
.
Something
of
the
old
Hurstwood
was
here
--
the
least
*NL*
shadow
of
what
was
once
shrewd
and
pleasant
strength
.
Outside
,
it
was
*NL*
cloudy
and
blowing
a
few
flakes
of
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
day
to
go
over
there
,
''
thought
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
he
left
before
she
did
,
which
was
a
remarkable
thing
,
and
tramped
*NL*
eastward
to
Fourteenth
Street
and
Sixth
Avenue
,
where
he
took
the
car
.
*NL*
He
had
read
that
scores
of
applicants
were
applying
at
the
office
of
the
*NL*
Brooklyn
City
Railroad
building
and
were
being
received
.
He
made
his
*NL*
way
there
by
horse-car
and
ferry
--
a
dark
,
silent
man
--
to
the
offices
in
*NL*
question
.
It
was
a
long
way
,
for
no
cars
were
running
,
and
the
day
was
*NL*
cold
;
but
he
trudged
along
grimly
.
Once
in
Brooklyn
,
he
could
clearly
*NL*
see
and
feel
that
a
strike
was
on
.
People
showed
it
in
their
manner
.
*NL*
Along
the
routes
of
certain
tracks
not
a
car
was
running
.
About
certain
*NL*
corners
and
nearby
saloons
small
groups
of
men
were
lounging
.
Several
*NL*
spring
wagons
passed
him
,
equipped
with
plain
wooden
chairs
,
and
*NL*
labelled
``
Flatbush
''
or
``
Prospect
Park
.
Fare
,
Ten
Cents
.
''
He
noticed
cold
*NL*
and
even
gloomy
faces
.
Labour
was
having
its
little
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
near
the
office
in
question
,
he
saw
a
few
men
standing
*NL*
about
,
and
some
policemen
.
On
the
far
corners
were
other
men
--
whom
he
*NL*
took
to
be
strikers
--
watching
.
All
the
houses
were
small
and
wooden
,
the
*NL*
streets
poorly
paved
.
After
New
York
,
Brooklyn
looked
actually
poor
and
*NL*
hard-up
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
his
way
into
the
heart
of
the
small
group
,
eyed
by
policemen
and
*NL*
the
men
already
there
.
One
of
the
officers
addressed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
looking
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
if
I
can
get
a
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
offices
are
up
those
steps
,
''
said
the
bluecoat
.
His
face
was
a
very
*NL*
neutral
thing
to
contemplate
.
In
his
heart
of
hearts
,
he
sympathised
*NL*
with
the
strikers
and
hated
this
``
scab
.
''
In
his
heart
of
hearts
,
also
,
*NL*
he
felt
the
dignity
and
use
of
the
police
force
,
which
commanded
order
.
*NL*
Of
its
true
social
significance
,
he
never
once
dreamed
.
His
was
not
the
*NL*
mind
for
that
.
The
two
feelings
blended
in
him
--
neutralised
one
another
*NL*
and
him
.
He
would
have
fought
for
this
man
as
determinedly
as
for
*NL*
himself
,
and
yet
only
so
far
as
commanded
.
Strip
him
of
his
uniform
,
and
*NL*
he
would
have
soon
picked
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
ascended
a
dusty
flight
of
steps
and
entered
a
small
,
*NL*
dust-coloured
office
,
in
which
were
a
railing
,
a
long
desk
,
and
several
*NL*
clerks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
?
''
said
a
middle-aged
man
,
looking
up
at
him
from
the
long
*NL*
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
hire
any
men
?
''
inquired
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
--
a
motorman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
'm
not
anything
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
at
all
abashed
by
his
position
.
He
knew
these
people
needed
*NL*
men
.
If
one
did
n't
take
him
,
another
would
.
This
man
could
take
him
or
*NL*
leave
him
,
just
as
he
chose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
prefer
experienced
men
,
of
course
,
''
said
the
man
.
He
paused
,
*NL*
while
Hurstwood
smiled
indifferently
.
Then
he
added
:
``
Still
,
I
guess
you
*NL*
can
learn
.
What
is
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wheeler
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
wrote
an
order
on
a
small
card
.
``
Take
that
to
our
barns
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
and
give
it
to
the
foreman
.
He
'll
show
you
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
went
down
and
out
.
He
walked
straight
away
in
the
direction
*NL*
indicated
,
while
the
policemen
looked
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
another
wants
to
try
it
,
''
said
Officer
Kiely
to
Officer
Macey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
my
mind
he
'll
get
his
fill
,
''
returned
the
latter
,
quietly
.
They
*NL*
had
been
in
strikes
before
.

Chapter
XLI
.
THE
STRIKE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
barn
at
which
Hurstwood
applied
was
exceedingly
short-handed
,
and
*NL*
was
being
operated
practically
by
three
men
as
directors
.
There
were
a
*NL*
lot
of
green
hands
around
--
queer
,
hungry-looking
men
,
who
looked
as
if
*NL*
want
had
driven
them
to
desperate
means
.
They
tried
to
be
lively
and
*NL*
willing
,
but
there
was
an
air
of
hang-dog
diffidence
about
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
went
back
through
the
barns
and
out
into
a
large
,
enclosed
*NL*
lot
,
where
were
a
series
of
tracks
and
loops
.
A
half-dozen
cars
were
*NL*
there
,
manned
by
instructors
,
each
with
a
pupil
at
the
lever
.
More
*NL*
pupils
were
waiting
at
one
of
the
rear
doors
of
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
silence
Hurstwood
viewed
this
scene
,
and
waited
.
His
companions
took
*NL*
his
eye
for
a
while
,
though
they
did
not
interest
him
much
more
than
the
*NL*
cars
.
They
were
an
uncomfortable-looking
gang
,
however
.
One
or
two
*NL*
were
very
thin
and
lean
.
Several
were
quite
stout
.
Several
others
were
*NL*
rawboned
and
sallow
,
as
if
they
had
been
beaten
upon
by
all
sorts
of
*NL*
rough
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
by
the
paper
they
are
going
to
call
out
the
militia
?
''
*NL*
Hurstwood
heard
one
of
them
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
'll
do
that
,
''
returned
the
other
.
``
They
always
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
we
're
liable
to
have
much
trouble
?
''
said
another
,
whom
Hurstwood
*NL*
did
not
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Scotchman
that
went
out
on
the
last
car
,
''
put
in
a
voice
,
``
told
me
*NL*
that
they
hit
him
in
the
ear
with
a
cinder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
,
nervous
laugh
accompanied
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
those
fellows
on
the
Fifth
Avenue
line
must
have
had
a
hell
of
*NL*
a
time
,
according
to
the
papers
,
''
drawled
another
.
``
They
broke
his
car
*NL*
windows
and
pulled
him
off
into
the
street
`
fore
the
police
could
stop
*NL*
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
there
are
more
police
around
to-day
,
''
was
added
by
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
hearkened
without
much
mental
comment
.
These
talkers
seemed
*NL*
scared
to
him
.
Their
gabbling
was
feverish
--
things
said
to
quiet
their
*NL*
own
minds
.
He
looked
out
into
the
yard
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
of
the
men
got
around
quite
near
him
,
but
behind
his
back
.
They
were
*NL*
rather
social
,
and
he
listened
to
what
they
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
railroad
man
?
''
said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
No
.
I
've
always
worked
in
a
paper
factory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
job
in
Newark
until
last
October
,
''
returned
the
other
,
with
*NL*
reciprocal
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
words
which
passed
too
low
to
hear
.
Then
the
*NL*
conversation
became
strong
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
blame
these
fellers
for
striking
,
''
said
one
.
``
They
've
got
the
*NL*
right
of
it
,
all
right
,
but
I
had
to
get
something
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Same
here
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
If
I
had
any
job
in
Newark
I
would
n't
be
*NL*
over
here
takin
'
chances
like
these
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
hell
these
days
,
ai
n't
it
?
''
said
the
man
.
``
A
poor
man
ai
n't
*NL*
nowhere
.
You
could
starve
,
by
God
,
right
in
the
streets
,
and
there
ai
n't
*NL*
most
no
one
would
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
you
are
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
The
job
I
had
I
lost
'cause
they
shut
*NL*
down
.
They
run
all
summer
and
lay
up
a
big
stock
,
and
then
shut
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
paid
some
little
attention
to
this
.
Somehow
,
he
felt
a
little
*NL*
superior
to
these
two
--
a
little
better
off
.
To
him
these
were
ignorant
*NL*
and
commonplace
,
poor
sheep
in
a
driver
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
devils
,
''
he
thought
,
speaking
out
of
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
*NL*
a
bygone
period
of
success
.
``
Next
,
''
said
one
of
the
instructors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
next
,
''
said
a
neighbour
,
touching
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
and
climbed
on
the
platform
.
The
instructor
took
it
for
*NL*
granted
that
no
preliminaries
were
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
this
handle
,
''
he
said
,
reaching
up
to
an
electric
cut-off
,
*NL*
which
was
fastened
to
the
roof
.
``
This
throws
the
current
off
or
on
.
If
*NL*
you
want
to
reverse
the
car
you
turn
it
over
here
.
If
you
want
to
send
*NL*
it
forward
,
you
put
it
over
here
.
If
you
want
to
cut
off
the
power
,
you
*NL*
keep
it
in
the
middle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
smiled
at
the
simple
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
this
handle
here
regulates
your
speed
.
To
here
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
*NL*
with
his
finger
,
``
gives
you
about
four
miles
an
hour
.
This
is
eight
.
*NL*
When
it
's
full
on
,
you
make
about
fourteen
miles
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
watched
him
calmly
.
He
had
seen
motormen
work
before
.
He
knew
*NL*
just
about
how
they
did
it
,
and
was
sure
he
could
do
as
well
,
with
a
*NL*
very
little
practice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
instructor
explained
a
few
more
details
,
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
we
'll
back
her
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
stood
placidly
by
,
while
the
car
rolled
back
into
the
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
you
want
to
be
careful
about
,
and
that
is
to
start
easy
.
Give
*NL*
one
degree
time
to
act
before
you
start
another
.
The
one
fault
of
most
*NL*
men
is
that
they
always
want
to
throw
her
wide
open
.
That
's
bad
.
It
's
*NL*
dangerous
,
too
.
Wears
out
the
motor
.
You
do
n't
want
to
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
and
waited
,
while
the
man
talked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
take
it
,
''
he
said
,
finally
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ex-manager
laid
hand
to
the
lever
and
pushed
it
gently
,
as
he
*NL*
thought
.
It
worked
much
easier
than
he
imagined
,
however
,
with
the
*NL*
result
that
the
car
jerked
quickly
forward
,
throwing
him
back
against
*NL*
the
door
.
He
straightened
up
sheepishly
,
while
the
instructor
stopped
*NL*
the
car
with
the
brake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
be
careful
about
that
,
''
was
all
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
found
,
however
,
that
handling
a
brake
and
regulating
speed
*NL*
were
not
so
instantly
mastered
as
he
had
imagined
.
Once
or
twice
he
*NL*
would
have
ploughed
through
the
rear
fence
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
*NL*
hand
and
word
of
his
companion
.
The
latter
was
rather
patient
with
him
,
*NL*
but
he
never
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
to
get
the
knack
of
working
both
arms
at
once
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
*NL*
takes
a
little
practice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
o'clock
came
while
he
was
still
on
the
car
practising
,
and
he
began
*NL*
to
feel
hungry
.
The
day
set
in
snowing
,
and
he
was
cold
.
He
grew
weary
*NL*
of
running
to
and
fro
on
the
short
track
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
ran
the
car
to
the
end
and
both
got
off
.
Hurstwood
went
into
the
*NL*
barn
and
sought
a
car
step
,
pulling
out
his
paper-wrapped
lunch
from
*NL*
his
pocket
.
There
was
no
water
and
the
bread
was
dry
,
but
he
enjoyed
*NL*
it
.
There
was
no
ceremony
about
dining
.
He
swallowed
and
looked
*NL*
about
,
contemplating
the
dull
,
homely
labour
of
the
thing
.
It
was
*NL*
disagreeable
--
miserably
disagreeable
--
in
all
its
phases
.
Not
because
*NL*
it
was
bitter
,
but
because
it
was
hard
.
It
would
be
hard
to
any
one
,
he
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
eating
,
he
stood
about
as
before
,
waiting
until
his
turn
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
intention
was
to
give
him
an
afternoon
of
practice
,
but
the
greater
*NL*
part
of
the
time
was
spent
in
waiting
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
evening
came
,
and
with
it
hunger
and
a
debate
with
himself
as
to
*NL*
how
he
should
spend
the
night
.
It
was
half-past
five
.
He
must
soon
eat
.
*NL*
If
he
tried
to
go
home
,
it
would
take
him
two
hours
and
a
half
of
cold
*NL*
walking
and
riding
.
Besides
he
had
orders
to
report
at
seven
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
and
going
home
would
necessitate
his
rising
at
an
unholy
and
*NL*
disagreeable
hour
.
He
had
only
something
like
a
dollar
and
fifteen
cents
*NL*
of
Carrie
's
money
,
with
which
he
had
intended
to
pay
the
two
weeks
'
coal
*NL*
bill
before
the
present
idea
struck
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
must
have
some
place
around
here
,
''
he
thought
.
``
Where
does
that
*NL*
fellow
from
Newark
stay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
he
decided
to
ask
.
There
was
a
young
fellow
standing
near
one
*NL*
of
the
doors
in
the
cold
,
waiting
a
last
turn
.
He
was
a
mere
boy
in
*NL*
years
--
twenty-one
about
--
but
with
a
body
lank
and
long
,
because
of
*NL*
privation
.
A
little
good
living
would
have
made
this
youth
plump
and
*NL*
swaggering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
they
arrange
this
,
if
a
man
has
n't
any
money
?
''
inquired
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
discreetly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellow
turned
a
keen
,
watchful
face
on
the
inquirer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
eat
?
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
sleep
.
I
ca
n't
go
back
to
New
York
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
foreman
'll
fix
that
if
you
ask
him
,
I
guess
.
He
did
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
just
told
him
I
did
n't
have
anything
.
Gee
,
I
could
n't
go
home
.
I
*NL*
live
way
over
in
Hoboken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
only
cleared
his
throat
by
way
of
acknowledgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
got
a
place
upstairs
here
,
I
understand
.
I
do
n't
know
what
sort
*NL*
of
a
thing
it
is
.
Purty
tough
,
I
guess
.
He
gave
me
a
meal
ticket
this
*NL*
noon
.
I
know
that
was
n't
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
smiled
grimly
,
and
the
boy
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
no
fun
,
is
it
?
''
he
inquired
,
wishing
vainly
for
a
cheery
*NL*
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
,
''
answered
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
tackle
him
now
,
''
volunteered
the
youth
.
``
He
may
go
`
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
there
some
place
I
can
stay
around
here
to-night
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
``
If
I
have
to
go
back
to
New
York
,
I
'm
afraid
I
wo
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
're
some
cots
upstairs
,
''
interrupted
the
man
,
``
if
you
want
one
of
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
do
,
''
he
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
meant
to
ask
for
a
meal
ticket
,
but
the
seemingly
proper
moment
never
*NL*
came
,
and
he
decided
to
pay
himself
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
ask
him
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ate
in
a
cheap
restaurant
in
the
vicinity
,
and
,
being
cold
and
*NL*
lonely
,
went
straight
off
to
seek
the
loft
in
question
.
The
company
was
*NL*
not
attempting
to
run
cars
after
nightfall
.
It
was
so
advised
by
the
*NL*
police
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
seemed
to
have
been
a
lounging
place
for
night
workers
.
There
*NL*
were
some
nine
cots
in
the
place
,
two
or
three
wooden
chairs
,
a
soap
*NL*
box
,
and
a
small
,
round-bellied
stove
,
in
which
a
fire
was
blazing
.
*NL*
Early
as
he
was
,
another
man
was
there
before
him
.
The
latter
was
*NL*
sitting
beside
the
stove
warming
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
approached
and
held
out
his
own
toward
the
fire
.
He
was
sick
*NL*
of
the
bareness
and
privation
of
all
things
connected
with
his
venture
,
*NL*
but
was
steeling
himself
to
hold
out
.
He
fancied
he
could
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cold
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
the
early
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
long
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
of
a
place
to
sleep
in
,
is
it
?
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
than
nothing
,
''
replied
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
'll
turn
in
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rising
,
he
went
to
one
of
the
cots
and
stretched
himself
,
removing
only
*NL*
his
shoes
,
and
pulling
the
one
blanket
and
dirty
old
comforter
over
him
*NL*
in
a
sort
of
bundle
.
The
sight
disgusted
Hurstwood
,
but
he
did
not
dwell
*NL*
on
it
,
choosing
to
gaze
into
the
stove
and
think
of
something
else
.
*NL*
Presently
he
decided
to
retire
,
and
picked
a
cot
,
also
removing
his
*NL*
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
doing
so
,
the
youth
who
had
advised
him
to
come
here
*NL*
entered
,
and
,
seeing
Hurstwood
,
tried
to
be
genial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
'n
nothin
'
,
''
he
observed
,
looking
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
did
not
take
this
to
himself
.
He
thought
it
to
be
an
*NL*
expression
of
individual
satisfaction
,
and
so
did
not
answer
.
The
*NL*
youth
imagined
he
was
out
of
sorts
,
and
set
to
whistling
softly
.
Seeing
*NL*
another
man
asleep
,
he
quit
that
and
lapsed
into
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
made
the
best
of
a
bad
lot
by
keeping
on
his
clothes
and
*NL*
pushing
away
the
dirty
covering
from
his
head
,
but
at
last
he
dozed
*NL*
in
sheer
weariness
.
The
covering
became
more
and
more
comfortable
,
its
*NL*
character
was
forgotten
,
and
he
pulled
it
about
his
neck
and
slept
.
*NL*
In
the
morning
he
was
aroused
out
of
a
pleasant
dream
by
several
men
*NL*
stirring
about
in
the
cold
,
cheerless
room
.
He
had
been
back
in
Chicago
*NL*
in
fancy
,
in
his
own
comfortable
home
.
Jessica
had
been
arranging
to
go
*NL*
somewhere
,
and
he
had
been
talking
with
her
about
it
.
This
was
so
clear
*NL*
in
his
mind
,
that
he
was
startled
now
by
the
contrast
of
this
room
.
*NL*
He
raised
his
head
,
and
the
cold
,
bitter
reality
jarred
him
into
*NL*
wakefulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guess
I
'd
better
get
up
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
water
on
this
floor
.
He
put
on
his
shoes
in
the
cold
*NL*
and
stood
up
,
shaking
himself
in
his
stiffness
.
His
clothes
felt
*NL*
disagreeable
,
his
hair
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hell
!
''
he
muttered
,
as
he
put
on
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Downstairs
things
were
stirring
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
a
hydrant
,
with
a
trough
which
had
once
been
used
for
horses
,
*NL*
but
there
was
no
towel
here
,
and
his
handkerchief
was
soiled
from
*NL*
yesterday
.
He
contented
himself
with
wetting
his
eyes
with
the
ice-cold
*NL*
water
.
Then
he
sought
the
foreman
,
who
was
already
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
your
breakfast
yet
?
''
inquired
that
worthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
get
it
,
then
;
your
car
wo
n't
be
ready
for
a
little
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
let
me
have
a
meal
ticket
?
''
he
asked
with
an
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
''
said
the
man
,
handing
him
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
breakfasted
as
poorly
as
the
night
before
on
some
fried
steak
and
bad
*NL*
coffee
.
Then
he
went
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
the
foreman
,
motioning
him
,
when
he
came
in
.
``
You
take
this
*NL*
car
out
in
a
few
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
climbed
up
on
the
platform
in
the
gloomy
barn
and
waited
for
*NL*
a
signal
.
He
was
nervous
,
and
yet
the
thing
was
a
relief
.
Anything
was
*NL*
better
than
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
the
fourth
day
of
the
strike
,
the
situation
had
taken
a
turn
for
*NL*
the
worse
.
The
strikers
,
following
the
counsel
of
their
leaders
and
*NL*
the
newspapers
,
had
struggled
peaceably
enough
.
There
had
been
no
great
*NL*
violence
done
.
Cars
had
been
stopped
,
it
is
true
,
and
the
men
argued
*NL*
with
.
Some
crews
had
been
won
over
and
led
away
,
some
windows
broken
,
*NL*
some
jeering
and
yelling
done
;
but
in
no
more
than
five
or
six
instances
*NL*
had
men
been
seriously
injured
.
These
by
crowds
whose
acts
the
leaders
*NL*
disclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Idleness
,
however
,
and
the
sight
of
the
company
,
backed
by
the
police
,
*NL*
triumphing
,
angered
the
men
.
They
saw
that
each
day
more
cars
were
going
*NL*
on
,
each
day
more
declarations
were
being
made
by
the
company
officials
*NL*
that
the
effective
opposition
of
the
strikers
was
broken
.
This
put
*NL*
desperate
thoughts
in
the
minds
of
the
men
.
Peaceful
methods
meant
,
they
*NL*
saw
,
that
the
companies
would
soon
run
all
their
cars
and
those
who
*NL*
had
complained
would
be
forgotten
.
There
was
nothing
so
helpful
to
the
*NL*
companies
as
peaceful
methods
.
All
at
once
they
blazed
forth
,
and
for
*NL*
a
week
there
was
storm
and
stress
.
Cars
were
assailed
,
men
attacked
,
*NL*
policemen
struggled
with
,
tracks
torn
up
,
and
shots
fired
,
until
at
*NL*
last
street
fights
and
mob
movements
became
frequent
,
and
the
city
was
*NL*
invested
with
militia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
knew
nothing
of
the
change
of
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
your
car
out
,
''
called
the
foreman
,
waving
a
vigorous
hand
at
him
.
A
*NL*
green
conductor
jumped
up
behind
and
rang
the
bell
twice
as
a
signal
to
*NL*
start
.
Hurstwood
turned
the
lever
and
ran
the
car
out
through
the
door
*NL*
into
the
street
in
front
of
the
barn
.
Here
two
brawny
policemen
got
up
*NL*
beside
him
on
the
platform
--
one
on
either
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sound
of
a
gong
near
the
barn
door
,
two
bells
were
given
by
the
*NL*
conductor
and
Hurstwood
opened
his
lever
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
policemen
looked
about
them
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
cold
,
all
right
,
this
morning
,
''
said
the
one
on
the
left
,
who
*NL*
possessed
a
rich
brogue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
enough
of
it
yesterday
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
I
would
n't
want
a
*NL*
steady
job
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
Hurstwood
,
who
stood
facing
*NL*
the
cold
wind
,
which
was
chilling
him
completely
,
and
thinking
of
his
*NL*
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
a
steady
gait
,
''
the
foreman
had
said
.
``
Do
n't
stop
for
any
one
who
*NL*
does
n't
look
like
a
real
passenger
.
Whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
stop
for
a
*NL*
crowd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
officers
kept
silent
for
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
man
must
have
gone
through
all
right
,
''
said
the
officer
on
the
*NL*
left
.
``
I
do
n't
see
his
car
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
on
there
?
''
asked
the
second
officer
,
referring
,
of
course
,
to
its
*NL*
complement
of
policemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Schaeffer
and
Ryan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
silence
,
in
which
the
car
ran
smoothly
along
.
There
*NL*
were
not
so
many
houses
along
this
part
of
the
way
.
Hurstwood
did
not
*NL*
see
many
people
either
.
The
situation
was
not
wholly
disagreeable
to
*NL*
him
.
If
he
were
not
so
cold
,
he
thought
he
would
do
well
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
brought
out
of
this
feeling
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
curve
*NL*
ahead
,
which
he
had
not
expected
.
He
shut
off
the
current
and
did
an
*NL*
energetic
turn
at
the
brake
,
but
not
in
time
to
avoid
an
unnaturally
*NL*
quick
turn
.
It
shook
him
up
and
made
him
feel
like
making
some
*NL*
apologetic
remarks
,
but
he
refrained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
look
out
for
them
things
,
''
said
the
officer
on
the
left
,
*NL*
condescendingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
agreed
Hurstwood
,
shamefacedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
lots
of
them
on
this
line
,
''
said
the
officer
on
the
right
.
*NL*
Around
the
corner
a
more
populated
way
appeared
.
One
or
two
pedestrians
*NL*
were
in
view
ahead
.
A
boy
coming
out
of
a
gate
with
a
tin
milk
bucket
*NL*
gave
Hurstwood
his
first
objectionable
greeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scab
!
''
he
yelled
.
``
Scab
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
heard
it
,
but
tried
to
make
no
comment
,
even
to
himself
.
He
*NL*
knew
he
would
get
that
,
and
much
more
of
the
same
sort
,
probably
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
corner
farther
up
a
man
stood
by
the
track
and
signalled
the
car
to
*NL*
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
him
,
''
said
one
of
the
officers
.
``
He
's
up
to
some
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
obeyed
.
At
the
corner
he
saw
the
wisdom
of
it
.
No
sooner
did
*NL*
the
man
perceive
the
intention
to
ignore
him
,
than
he
shook
his
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
bloody
coward
!
''
he
yelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
half
dozen
men
,
standing
on
the
corner
,
flung
taunts
and
jeers
*NL*
after
the
speeding
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
winced
the
least
bit
.
The
real
thing
was
slightly
worse
than
*NL*
the
thoughts
of
it
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
came
in
sight
,
three
or
four
blocks
farther
on
,
a
heap
of
something
*NL*
on
the
track
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
been
at
work
,
here
,
all
right
,
''
said
one
of
the
policemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
have
an
argument
,
maybe
,
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
ran
the
car
close
and
stopped
.
He
had
not
done
so
wholly
,
*NL*
however
,
before
a
crowd
gathered
about
.
It
was
composed
of
ex-motormen
*NL*
and
conductors
in
part
,
with
a
sprinkling
of
friends
and
sympathisers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
off
the
car
,
pardner
,
''
said
one
of
the
men
in
a
voice
meant
to
*NL*
be
conciliatory
.
``
You
do
n't
want
to
take
the
bread
out
of
another
man
's
*NL*
mouth
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
held
to
his
brake
and
lever
,
pale
and
very
uncertain
what
to
*NL*
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
back
,
''
yelled
one
of
the
officers
,
leaning
over
the
platform
*NL*
railing
.
``
Clear
out
of
this
,
now
.
Give
the
man
a
chance
to
do
his
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
pardner
,
''
said
the
leader
,
ignoring
the
policeman
and
*NL*
addressing
Hurstwood
.
``
We
're
all
working
men
,
like
yourself
.
If
you
were
*NL*
a
regular
motorman
,
and
had
been
treated
as
we
've
been
,
you
would
n't
*NL*
want
any
one
to
come
in
and
take
your
place
,
would
you
?
You
would
n't
*NL*
want
any
one
to
do
you
out
of
your
chance
to
get
your
rights
,
would
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
her
off
!
shut
her
off
!
''
urged
the
other
of
the
policemen
,
roughly
.
*NL*
``
Get
out
of
this
,
now
,
''
and
he
jumped
the
railing
and
landed
before
the
*NL*
crowd
and
began
shoving
.
Instantly
the
other
officer
was
down
beside
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
back
,
now
,
''
they
yelled
.
``
Get
out
of
this
.
What
the
hell
do
you
*NL*
mean
?
Out
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
a
small
swarm
of
bees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
shove
me
,
''
said
one
of
the
strikers
,
determinedly
.
``
I
'm
not
doing
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
of
this
!
''
cried
the
officer
,
swinging
his
club
.
``
I
'll
give
ye
a
*NL*
bat
on
the
sconce
.
Back
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
hell
!
''
cried
another
of
the
strikers
,
pushing
the
other
way
,
*NL*
adding
at
the
same
time
some
lusty
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crack
came
an
officer
's
club
on
his
forehead
.
He
blinked
his
eyes
*NL*
blindly
a
few
times
,
wabbled
on
his
legs
,
threw
up
his
hands
,
and
*NL*
staggered
back
.
In
return
,
a
swift
fist
landed
on
the
officer
's
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Infuriated
by
this
,
the
latter
plunged
left
and
right
,
laying
about
*NL*
madly
with
his
club
.
He
was
ably
assisted
by
his
brother
of
the
blue
,
*NL*
who
poured
ponderous
oaths
upon
the
troubled
waters
.
No
severe
damage
*NL*
was
done
,
owing
to
the
agility
of
the
strikers
in
keeping
out
of
reach
.
*NL*
They
stood
about
the
sidewalk
now
and
jeered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
conductor
?
''
yelled
one
of
the
officers
,
getting
his
eye
on
*NL*
that
individual
,
who
had
come
nervously
forward
to
stand
by
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
The
latter
had
stood
gazing
upon
the
scene
with
more
astonishment
than
*NL*
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
come
down
here
and
get
these
stones
off
the
track
?
''
*NL*
inquired
the
officer
.
``
What
you
standing
there
for
?
Do
you
want
to
stay
*NL*
here
all
day
?
Get
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
breathed
heavily
in
excitement
and
jumped
down
with
the
*NL*
nervous
conductor
as
if
he
had
been
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurry
up
,
now
,
''
said
the
other
policeman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cold
as
it
was
,
these
officers
were
hot
and
mad
.
Hurstwood
worked
with
*NL*
the
conductor
,
lifting
stone
after
stone
and
warming
himself
by
the
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
scab
,
you
!
''
yelled
the
crowd
.
``
You
coward
!
Steal
a
man
's
job
,
*NL*
will
you
?
Rob
the
poor
,
will
you
,
you
thief
?
We
'll
get
you
yet
,
now
.
*NL*
Wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
all
of
this
was
delivered
by
one
man
.
It
came
from
here
and
there
,
*NL*
incorporated
with
much
more
of
the
same
sort
and
curses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Work
,
you
blackguards
,
''
yelled
a
voice
.
``
Do
the
dirty
work
.
You
're
the
*NL*
suckers
that
keep
the
poor
people
down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
God
starve
ye
yet
,
''
yelled
an
old
Irish
woman
,
who
now
threw
open
a
*NL*
nearby
window
and
stuck
out
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
you
,
''
she
added
,
catching
the
eye
of
one
of
the
policemen
.
*NL*
``
You
bloody
,
murtherin
'
thafe
!
Crack
my
son
over
the
head
,
will
you
,
you
*NL*
hardhearted
,
murtherin
'
divil
?
Ah
,
ye
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
officer
turned
a
deaf
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
the
devil
,
you
old
hag
,
''
he
half
muttered
as
he
stared
round
upon
*NL*
the
scattered
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
stones
were
off
,
and
Hurstwood
took
his
place
again
amid
a
*NL*
continued
chorus
of
epithets
.
Both
officers
got
up
beside
him
and
the
*NL*
conductor
rang
the
bell
,
when
,
bang
!
bang
!
through
window
and
door
*NL*
came
rocks
and
stones
.
One
narrowly
grazed
Hurstwood
's
head
.
Another
*NL*
shattered
the
window
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Throw
open
your
lever
,
''
yelled
one
of
the
officers
,
grabbing
at
the
*NL*
handle
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
complied
and
the
car
shot
away
,
followed
by
a
rattle
of
stones
*NL*
and
a
rain
of
curses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
--
--
--
--
hit
me
in
the
neck
,
''
said
one
of
the
officers
.
``
I
*NL*
gave
him
a
good
crack
for
it
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
must
have
left
spots
on
some
of
them
,
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
big
guy
that
called
us
a
--
--
--
--
''
said
the
first
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
get
him
yet
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
we
were
in
for
it
sure
,
once
there
,
''
said
the
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
warmed
and
excited
,
gazed
steadily
ahead
.
It
was
an
*NL*
astonishing
experience
for
him
.
He
had
read
of
these
things
,
but
the
*NL*
reality
seemed
something
altogether
new
.
He
was
no
coward
in
spirit
.
*NL*
The
fact
that
he
had
suffered
this
much
now
rather
operated
to
arouse
a
*NL*
stolid
determination
to
stick
it
out
.
He
did
not
recur
in
thought
to
New
*NL*
York
or
the
flat
.
This
one
trip
seemed
a
consuming
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
ran
into
the
business
heart
of
Brooklyn
uninterrupted
.
People
*NL*
gazed
at
the
broken
windows
of
the
car
and
at
Hurstwood
in
his
plain
*NL*
clothes
.
Voices
called
``
scab
''
now
and
then
,
as
well
as
other
epithets
,
*NL*
but
no
crowd
attacked
the
car
.
At
the
downtown
end
of
the
line
,
one
of
*NL*
the
officers
went
to
call
up
his
station
and
report
the
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
gang
out
there
,
''
he
said
,
``
laying
for
us
yet
.
Better
send
*NL*
some
one
over
there
and
clean
them
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
car
ran
back
more
quietly
--
hooted
,
watched
,
flung
at
,
but
not
*NL*
attacked
.
Hurstwood
breathed
freely
when
he
saw
the
barns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
observed
to
himself
,
``
I
came
out
of
that
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
car
was
turned
in
and
he
was
allowed
to
loaf
a
while
,
but
later
he
*NL*
was
again
called
.
This
time
a
new
team
of
officers
was
aboard
.
Slightly
*NL*
more
confident
,
he
sped
the
car
along
the
commonplace
streets
and
felt
*NL*
somewhat
less
fearful
.
On
one
side
,
however
,
he
suffered
intensely
.
The
*NL*
day
was
raw
,
with
a
sprinkling
of
snow
and
a
gusty
wind
,
made
all
the
*NL*
more
intolerable
by
the
speed
of
the
car
.
His
clothing
was
not
intended
*NL*
for
this
sort
of
work
.
He
shivered
,
stamped
his
feet
,
and
beat
his
arms
*NL*
as
he
had
seen
other
motormen
do
in
the
past
,
but
said
nothing
.
The
*NL*
novelty
and
danger
of
the
situation
modified
in
a
way
his
disgust
and
*NL*
distress
at
being
compelled
to
be
here
,
but
not
enough
to
prevent
him
*NL*
from
feeling
grim
and
sour
.
This
was
a
dog
's
life
,
he
thought
.
It
was
a
*NL*
tough
thing
to
have
to
come
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
thought
that
strengthened
him
was
the
insult
offered
by
Carrie
.
*NL*
He
was
not
down
so
low
as
to
take
all
that
,
he
thought
.
He
could
do
*NL*
something
--
this
,
even
--
for
a
while
.
It
would
get
better
.
He
would
save
a
*NL*
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
boy
threw
a
clod
of
mud
while
he
was
thus
reflecting
and
hit
him
upon
*NL*
the
arm
.
It
hurt
sharply
and
angered
him
more
than
he
had
been
any
time
*NL*
since
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
cur
!
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurt
you
?
''
asked
one
of
the
policemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
of
the
corners
,
where
the
car
slowed
up
because
of
a
turn
,
an
*NL*
ex-motorman
,
standing
on
the
sidewalk
,
called
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
come
out
,
pardner
,
and
be
a
man
?
Remember
we
're
fighting
for
*NL*
decent
day
's
wages
,
that
's
all
.
We
've
got
families
to
support
.
''
The
man
*NL*
seemed
most
peaceably
inclined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
pretended
not
to
see
him
.
He
kept
his
eyes
straight
on
before
*NL*
and
opened
the
lever
wide
.
The
voice
had
something
appealing
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
morning
this
went
on
and
long
into
the
afternoon
.
He
made
three
*NL*
such
trips
.
The
dinner
he
had
was
no
stay
for
such
work
and
the
cold
was
*NL*
telling
on
him
.
At
each
end
of
the
line
he
stopped
to
thaw
out
,
but
*NL*
he
could
have
groaned
at
the
anguish
of
it
.
One
of
the
barnmen
,
out
of
*NL*
pity
,
loaned
him
a
heavy
cap
and
a
pair
of
sheepskin
gloves
,
and
for
*NL*
once
he
was
extremely
thankful
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
second
trip
of
the
afternoon
he
ran
into
a
crowd
about
half
*NL*
way
along
the
line
,
that
had
blocked
the
car
's
progress
with
an
old
*NL*
telegraph
pole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
that
thing
off
the
track
,
''
shouted
the
two
policemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yah
,
yah
,
yah
!
''
yelled
the
crowd
.
``
Get
it
off
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
policemen
got
down
and
Hurstwood
started
to
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
stay
there
,
''
one
called
.
``
Some
one
will
run
away
with
your
car
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
the
babel
of
voices
,
Hurstwood
heard
one
close
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
down
,
pardner
,
and
be
a
man
.
Do
n't
fight
the
poor
.
Leave
that
to
*NL*
the
corporations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
the
same
fellow
who
had
called
to
him
from
the
corner
.
Now
,
as
*NL*
before
,
he
pretended
not
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
down
,
''
the
man
repeated
gently
.
``
You
do
n't
want
to
fight
poor
men
.
*NL*
Do
n't
fight
at
all
.
''
It
was
a
most
philosophic
and
jesuitical
motorman
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
third
policeman
joined
the
other
two
from
somewhere
and
some
one
ran
*NL*
to
telephone
for
more
officers
.
Hurstwood
gazed
about
,
determined
but
*NL*
fearful
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
grabbed
him
by
the
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
off
of
that
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
jerking
at
him
and
trying
to
pull
him
*NL*
over
the
railing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
go
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
savagely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
show
you
--
you
scab
!
''
cried
a
young
Irishman
,
jumping
up
on
the
car
*NL*
and
aiming
a
blow
at
Hurstwood
.
The
latter
ducked
and
caught
it
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
instead
of
the
jaw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Away
from
here
,
''
shouted
an
officer
,
hastening
to
the
rescue
,
and
*NL*
adding
,
of
course
,
the
usual
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
recovered
himself
,
pale
and
trembling
.
It
was
becoming
serious
*NL*
with
him
now
.
People
were
looking
up
and
jeering
at
him
.
One
girl
was
*NL*
making
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
waver
in
his
resolution
,
when
a
patrol
wagon
rolled
up
and
*NL*
more
officers
dismounted
.
Now
the
track
was
quickly
cleared
and
the
*NL*
release
effected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
go
now
,
quick
,
''
said
the
officer
,
and
again
he
was
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
end
came
with
a
real
mob
,
which
met
the
car
on
its
return
trip
*NL*
a
mile
or
two
from
the
barns
.
It
was
an
exceedingly
poor-looking
*NL*
neighbourhood
.
He
wanted
to
run
fast
through
it
,
but
again
the
track
*NL*
was
blocked
.
He
saw
men
carrying
something
out
to
it
when
he
was
yet
a
*NL*
half-dozen
blocks
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
they
are
again
!
''
exclaimed
one
policeman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
them
something
this
time
,
''
said
the
second
officer
,
whose
*NL*
patience
was
becoming
worn
.
Hurstwood
suffered
a
qualm
of
body
as
the
*NL*
car
rolled
up
.
As
before
,
the
crowd
began
hooting
,
but
now
,
rather
*NL*
than
come
near
,
they
threw
things
.
One
or
two
windows
were
smashed
and
*NL*
Hurstwood
dodged
a
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
policemen
ran
out
toward
the
crowd
,
but
the
latter
replied
by
*NL*
running
toward
the
car
.
A
woman
--
a
mere
girl
in
appearance
--
was
among
*NL*
these
,
bearing
a
rough
stick
.
She
was
exceedingly
wrathful
and
struck
*NL*
at
Hurstwood
,
who
dodged
.
Thereupon
,
her
companions
,
duly
encouraged
,
*NL*
jumped
on
the
car
and
pulled
Hurstwood
over
.
He
had
hardly
time
to
speak
*NL*
or
shout
before
he
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
go
of
me
,
''
he
said
,
falling
on
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
sucker
,
''
he
heard
some
one
say
.
Kicks
and
blows
rained
on
him
.
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
suffocating
.
Then
two
men
seemed
to
be
dragging
him
off
*NL*
and
he
wrestled
for
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
up
,
''
said
a
voice
,
``
you
're
all
right
.
Stand
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
let
loose
and
recovered
himself
.
Now
he
recognised
two
officers
.
*NL*
He
felt
as
if
he
would
faint
from
exhaustion
.
Something
was
wet
on
his
*NL*
chin
.
He
put
up
his
hand
and
felt
,
then
looked
.
It
was
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
cut
me
,
''
he
said
,
foolishly
,
fishing
for
his
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
now
,
''
said
one
of
the
officers
.
``
It
's
only
a
scratch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
senses
became
cleared
now
and
he
looked
around
.
He
was
standing
in
a
*NL*
little
store
,
where
they
left
him
for
the
moment
.
Outside
,
he
could
see
,
*NL*
as
he
stood
wiping
his
chin
,
the
car
and
the
excited
crowd
.
A
patrol
*NL*
wagon
was
there
,
and
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
over
and
looked
out
.
It
was
an
ambulance
,
backing
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
some
energetic
charging
by
the
police
and
arrests
being
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
now
,
if
you
want
to
take
your
car
,
''
said
an
officer
,
opening
*NL*
the
door
and
looking
in
.
He
walked
out
,
feeling
rather
uncertain
of
*NL*
himself
.
He
was
very
cold
and
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
conductor
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
not
here
now
,
''
said
the
policeman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
went
toward
the
car
and
stepped
nervously
on
.
As
he
did
so
*NL*
there
was
a
pistol
shot
.
Something
stung
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
fired
that
?
''
he
heard
an
officer
exclaim
.
``
By
God
!
who
did
that
?
''
*NL*
Both
left
him
,
running
toward
a
certain
building
.
He
paused
a
moment
and
*NL*
then
got
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
George
!
''
exclaimed
Hurstwood
,
weakly
,
``
this
is
too
much
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
nervously
to
the
corner
and
hurried
down
a
side
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whew
!
''
he
said
,
drawing
in
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
half
block
away
,
a
small
girl
gazed
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
sneak
,
''
she
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
homeward
in
a
blinding
snowstorm
,
reaching
the
ferry
by
*NL*
dusk
.
The
cabins
were
filled
with
comfortable
souls
,
who
studied
him
*NL*
curiously
.
His
head
was
still
in
such
a
whirl
that
he
felt
confused
.
All
*NL*
the
wonder
of
the
twinkling
lights
of
the
river
in
a
white
storm
passed
*NL*
for
nothing
.
He
trudged
doggedly
on
until
he
reached
the
flat
.
There
he
*NL*
entered
and
found
the
room
warm
.
Carrie
was
gone
.
A
couple
of
evening
*NL*
papers
were
lying
on
the
table
where
she
left
them
.
He
lit
the
gas
and
*NL*
sat
down
.
Then
he
got
up
and
stripped
to
examine
his
shoulder
.
It
was
*NL*
a
mere
scratch
.
He
washed
his
hands
and
face
,
still
in
a
brown
study
,
*NL*
apparently
,
and
combed
his
hair
.
Then
he
looked
for
something
to
eat
,
*NL*
and
finally
,
his
hunger
gone
,
sat
down
in
his
comfortable
rocking-chair
.
*NL*
It
was
a
wonderful
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
hand
to
his
chin
,
forgetting
,
for
the
moment
,
the
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
time
,
his
nature
recovering
itself
,
``
that
's
a
*NL*
pretty
tough
game
over
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
and
saw
the
papers
.
With
half
a
sigh
he
picked
up
the
*NL*
``
World
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strike
Spreading
in
Brooklyn
,
''
he
read
.
``
Rioting
Breaks
Out
in
all
*NL*
Parts
of
the
City
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
adjusted
his
paper
very
comfortably
and
continued
.
It
was
the
one
*NL*
thing
he
read
with
absorbing
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XLII
.
A
TOUCH
OF
SPRING
--
THE
EMPTY
SHELL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
look
upon
Hurstwood
's
Brooklyn
venture
as
an
error
of
judgment
*NL*
will
none
the
less
realise
the
negative
influence
on
him
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
he
had
tried
and
failed
.
Carrie
got
a
wrong
idea
of
it
.
He
said
*NL*
so
little
that
she
imagined
he
had
encountered
nothing
worse
than
*NL*
the
ordinary
roughness
--
quitting
so
soon
in
the
face
of
this
seemed
*NL*
trifling
.
He
did
not
want
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
now
one
of
a
group
of
oriental
beauties
who
,
in
the
second
act
*NL*
of
the
comic
opera
,
were
paraded
by
the
vizier
before
the
new
potentate
*NL*
as
the
treasures
of
his
harem
.
There
was
no
word
assigned
to
any
of
*NL*
them
,
but
on
the
evening
when
Hurstwood
was
housing
himself
in
the
*NL*
loft
of
the
street-car
barn
,
the
leading
comedian
and
star
,
feeling
*NL*
exceedingly
facetious
,
said
in
a
profound
voice
,
which
created
a
ripple
*NL*
of
laughter
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
merely
happened
to
be
Carrie
who
was
courtesying
before
him
.
It
might
*NL*
as
well
have
been
any
of
the
others
,
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
.
He
*NL*
expected
no
answer
and
a
dull
one
would
have
been
reproved
.
But
Carrie
,
*NL*
whose
experience
and
belief
in
herself
gave
her
daring
,
courtesied
*NL*
sweetly
again
and
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
yours
truly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
trivial
thing
to
say
,
and
yet
something
in
the
way
she
did
it
*NL*
caught
the
audience
,
which
laughed
heartily
at
the
mock-fierce
potentate
*NL*
towering
before
the
young
woman
.
The
comedian
also
liked
it
,
hearing
the
*NL*
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
your
name
was
Smith
,
''
he
returned
,
endeavouring
to
get
the
*NL*
last
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
almost
trembled
for
her
daring
after
she
had
said
this
.
All
*NL*
members
of
the
company
had
been
warned
that
to
interpolate
lines
or
*NL*
``
business
''
meant
a
fine
or
worse
.
She
did
not
know
what
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
standing
in
her
proper
position
in
the
wings
,
awaiting
*NL*
another
entry
,
the
great
comedian
made
his
exit
past
her
and
paused
in
*NL*
recognition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
just
leave
that
in
hereafter
,
''
he
remarked
,
seeing
how
*NL*
intelligent
she
appeared
.
``
Do
n't
add
any
more
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Carrie
,
humbly
.
When
he
went
on
she
found
herself
*NL*
trembling
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
in
luck
,
''
remarked
another
member
of
the
chorus
.
``
There
*NL*
is
n't
another
one
of
us
has
got
a
line
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
gainsaying
the
value
of
this
.
Everybody
in
the
company
*NL*
realised
that
she
had
got
a
start
.
Carrie
hugged
herself
when
next
*NL*
evening
the
lines
got
the
same
applause
.
She
went
home
rejoicing
,
*NL*
knowing
that
soon
something
must
come
of
it
.
It
was
Hurstwood
who
,
by
*NL*
his
presence
,
caused
her
merry
thoughts
to
flee
and
replaced
them
with
*NL*
sharp
longings
for
an
end
of
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
she
asked
him
about
his
venture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
not
trying
to
run
any
cars
except
with
police
.
They
do
n't
want
*NL*
anybody
just
now
--
not
before
next
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
week
came
,
but
Carrie
saw
no
change
.
Hurstwood
seemed
more
*NL*
apathetic
than
ever
.
He
saw
her
off
mornings
to
rehearsals
and
the
like
*NL*
with
the
utmost
calm
.
He
read
and
read
.
Several
times
he
found
himself
*NL*
staring
at
an
item
,
but
thinking
of
something
else
.
The
first
of
these
*NL*
lapses
that
he
sharply
noticed
concerned
a
hilarious
party
he
had
once
*NL*
attended
at
a
driving
club
,
of
which
he
had
been
a
member
.
He
sat
,
*NL*
gazing
downward
,
and
gradually
thought
he
heard
the
old
voices
and
the
*NL*
clink
of
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
dandy
,
Hurstwood
,
''
his
friend
Walker
said
.
He
was
standing
*NL*
again
well
dressed
,
smiling
,
good-natured
,
the
recipient
of
encores
for
*NL*
a
good
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
looked
up
.
The
room
was
so
still
it
seemed
ghostlike
.
*NL*
He
heard
the
clock
ticking
audibly
and
half
suspected
that
he
had
been
*NL*
dozing
.
The
paper
was
so
straight
in
his
hands
,
however
,
and
the
items
*NL*
he
had
been
reading
so
directly
before
him
,
that
he
rid
himself
of
the
*NL*
doze
idea
.
Still
,
it
seemed
peculiar
.
When
it
occurred
a
second
time
,
*NL*
however
,
it
did
not
seem
quite
so
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
Butcher
and
grocery
man
,
baker
and
coal
man
--
not
the
group
with
whom
he
*NL*
was
then
dealing
,
but
those
who
had
trusted
him
to
the
limit
--
called
.
He
*NL*
met
them
all
blandly
,
becoming
deft
in
excuse
.
At
last
he
became
bold
,
*NL*
pretended
to
be
out
,
or
waved
them
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ca
n't
get
blood
out
of
a
turnip
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
I
had
it
I
'd
pay
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
's
little
soldier
friend
,
Miss
Osborne
,
seeing
her
succeeding
,
had
*NL*
become
a
sort
of
satellite
.
Little
Osborne
could
never
of
herself
amount
*NL*
to
anything
.
She
seemed
to
realise
it
in
a
sort
of
pussy-like
way
and
*NL*
instinctively
concluded
to
cling
with
her
soft
little
claws
to
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
'll
get
up
,
''
she
kept
telling
Carrie
with
admiration
.
``
You
're
so
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Timid
as
Carrie
was
,
she
was
strong
in
capability
.
The
reliance
of
*NL*
others
made
her
feel
as
if
she
must
,
and
when
she
must
she
dared
.
*NL*
Experience
of
the
world
and
of
necessity
was
in
her
favour
.
No
longer
*NL*
the
lightest
word
of
a
man
made
her
head
dizzy
.
She
had
learned
that
men
*NL*
could
change
and
fail
.
Flattery
in
its
most
palpable
form
had
lost
its
*NL*
force
with
her
.
It
required
superiority
--
kindly
superiority
--
to
move
*NL*
her
--
the
superiority
of
a
genius
like
Ames
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
the
actors
in
our
company
,
''
she
told
Lola
one
day
.
*NL*
``
They
're
all
so
struck
on
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
Mr.
Barclay
's
pretty
nice
?
''
inquired
Lola
,
who
had
*NL*
received
a
condescending
smile
or
two
from
that
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
's
nice
enough
,
''
answered
Carrie
;
``
but
he
is
n't
sincere
.
He
*NL*
assumes
such
an
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lola
felt
for
her
first
hold
upon
Carrie
in
the
following
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
paying
room-rent
where
you
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
where
I
could
get
the
loveliest
room
and
bath
,
cheap
.
It
's
too
*NL*
big
for
me
,
but
it
would
be
just
right
for
two
,
and
the
rent
is
only
six
*NL*
dollars
a
week
for
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Seventeenth
Street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
as
I
'd
care
to
change
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
was
already
*NL*
turning
over
the
three-dollar
rate
in
her
mind
.
She
was
thinking
if
she
*NL*
had
only
herself
to
support
this
would
leave
her
seventeen
for
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
came
of
this
until
after
the
Brooklyn
adventure
of
Hurstwood
's
*NL*
and
her
success
with
the
speaking
part
.
Then
she
began
to
feel
as
if
she
*NL*
must
be
free
.
She
thought
of
leaving
Hurstwood
and
thus
making
him
act
*NL*
for
himself
,
but
he
had
developed
such
peculiar
traits
she
feared
he
*NL*
might
resist
any
effort
to
throw
him
off
.
He
might
hunt
her
out
at
*NL*
the
show
and
hound
her
in
that
way
.
She
did
not
wholly
believe
that
he
*NL*
would
,
but
he
might
.
This
,
she
knew
,
would
be
an
embarrassing
thing
if
*NL*
he
made
himself
conspicuous
in
any
way
.
It
troubled
her
greatly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
were
precipitated
by
the
offer
of
a
better
part
.
One
of
the
*NL*
actresses
playing
the
part
of
a
modest
sweetheart
gave
notice
of
leaving
*NL*
and
Carrie
was
selected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
are
you
going
to
get
?
''
asked
Miss
Osborne
,
on
hearing
the
good
*NL*
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
ask
him
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
find
out
.
Goodness
,
you
'll
never
get
anything
if
you
do
n't
ask
.
*NL*
Tell
them
you
must
have
forty
dollars
,
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
!
''
exclaimed
Lola
.
``
Ask
'em
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
succumbed
to
this
prompting
,
waiting
,
however
,
until
the
manager
*NL*
gave
her
notice
of
what
clothing
she
must
have
to
fit
the
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
I
get
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirty-five
dollars
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
too
much
astonished
and
delighted
to
think
of
mentioning
*NL*
forty
.
She
was
nearly
beside
herself
,
and
almost
hugged
Lola
,
who
clung
*NL*
to
her
at
the
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
as
much
as
you
ought
to
get
,
''
said
the
latter
,
``
especially
*NL*
when
you
've
got
to
buy
clothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
remembered
this
with
a
start
.
Where
to
get
the
money
?
She
had
*NL*
none
laid
up
for
such
an
emergency
.
Rent
day
was
drawing
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
not
do
it
,
''
she
said
,
remembering
her
necessity
.
``
I
do
n't
use
the
*NL*
flat
.
I
'm
not
going
to
give
up
my
money
this
time
.
I
'll
move
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fitting
into
this
came
another
appeal
from
Miss
Osborne
,
more
urgent
*NL*
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
live
with
me
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
she
pleaded
.
``
We
can
have
the
loveliest
*NL*
room
.
It
wo
n't
cost
you
hardly
anything
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
,
''
said
Carrie
,
frankly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
,
''
said
Lola
.
``
We
'll
have
such
a
good
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
thought
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
will
,
''
she
said
,
and
then
added
:
``
I
'll
have
to
see
first
,
*NL*
though
.
''
With
the
idea
thus
grounded
,
rent
day
approaching
,
and
clothes
*NL*
calling
for
instant
purchase
,
she
soon
found
excuse
in
Hurstwood
's
*NL*
lassitude
.
He
said
less
and
drooped
more
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
rent
day
approached
,
an
idea
grew
in
him
.
It
was
fostered
by
the
*NL*
demands
of
creditors
and
the
impossibility
of
holding
up
many
more
.
*NL*
Twenty-eight
dollars
was
too
much
for
rent
.
``
It
's
hard
on
her
,
''
he
*NL*
thought
.
``
We
could
get
a
cheaper
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Stirred
with
this
idea
,
he
spoke
at
the
breakfast
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
we
pay
too
much
rent
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
do
,
''
said
Carrie
,
not
catching
his
drift
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
we
could
get
a
smaller
place
,
''
he
suggested
.
``
We
do
n't
*NL*
need
four
rooms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
countenance
,
had
he
been
scrutinising
her
,
would
have
exhibited
the
*NL*
disturbance
she
felt
at
this
evidence
of
his
determination
to
stay
by
*NL*
her
.
He
saw
nothing
remarkable
in
asking
her
to
come
down
lower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
answered
,
growing
wary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
must
be
places
around
here
where
we
could
get
a
couple
of
rooms
,
*NL*
which
would
do
just
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
heart
revolted
.
``
Never
!
''
she
thought
.
Who
would
furnish
the
money
to
*NL*
move
?
To
think
of
being
in
two
rooms
with
him
!
She
resolved
to
spend
her
*NL*
money
for
clothes
quickly
,
before
something
terrible
happened
.
That
very
*NL*
day
she
did
it
.
Having
done
so
,
there
was
but
one
other
thing
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lola
,
''
she
said
,
visiting
her
friend
,
``
I
think
I
'll
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
jolly
!
''
cried
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
we
get
it
right
away
?
''
she
asked
,
meaning
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
cried
Lola
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
to
look
at
it
.
Carrie
had
saved
ten
dollars
from
her
*NL*
expenditures
--
enough
for
this
and
her
board
beside
.
Her
enlarged
salary
*NL*
would
not
begin
for
ten
days
yet
--
would
not
reach
her
for
seventeen
.
She
*NL*
paid
half
of
the
six
dollars
with
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
've
just
enough
to
get
on
to
the
end
of
the
week
,
''
she
confided
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
got
some
,
''
said
Lola
.
``
I
've
got
twenty-five
dollars
,
if
you
*NL*
need
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
guess
I
'll
get
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
decided
to
move
Friday
,
which
was
two
days
away
.
Now
that
the
*NL*
thing
was
settled
,
Carrie
's
heart
misgave
her
.
She
felt
very
much
like
a
*NL*
criminal
in
the
matter
.
Each
day
looking
at
Hurstwood
,
she
had
realised
*NL*
that
,
along
with
the
disagreeableness
of
his
attitude
,
there
was
*NL*
something
pathetic
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
the
same
evening
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
go
,
and
*NL*
now
he
seemed
not
so
shiftless
and
worthless
,
but
run
down
and
beaten
*NL*
upon
by
chance
.
His
eyes
were
not
keen
,
his
face
marked
,
his
hands
*NL*
flabby
.
She
thought
his
hair
had
a
touch
of
grey
.
All
unconscious
of
his
*NL*
doom
,
he
rocked
and
read
his
paper
,
while
she
glanced
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Knowing
that
the
end
was
so
near
,
she
became
rather
solicitous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
go
over
and
get
some
canned
peaches
?
''
she
asked
Hurstwood
,
*NL*
laying
down
a
two-dollar
bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
he
said
,
looking
in
wonder
at
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
if
you
can
get
some
nice
asparagus
,
''
she
added
.
``
I
'll
cook
it
for
*NL*
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
rose
and
took
the
money
,
slipping
on
his
overcoat
and
getting
*NL*
his
hat
.
Carrie
noticed
that
both
of
these
articles
of
apparel
were
old
*NL*
and
poor
looking
in
appearance
.
It
was
plain
enough
before
,
but
now
it
*NL*
came
home
with
peculiar
force
.
Perhaps
he
could
n't
help
it
,
after
all
.
*NL*
He
had
done
well
in
Chicago
.
She
remembered
his
fine
appearance
the
days
*NL*
he
had
met
her
in
the
park
.
Then
he
was
so
sprightly
,
so
clean
.
Had
it
*NL*
been
all
his
fault
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
back
and
laid
the
change
down
with
the
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
keep
it
,
''
she
observed
.
``
We
'll
need
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
sort
of
pride
;
``
you
keep
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
go
on
and
keep
it
,
''
she
replied
,
rather
unnerved
.
``
There
'll
be
*NL*
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
at
this
,
not
knowing
the
pathetic
figure
he
had
become
in
*NL*
her
eyes
.
She
restrained
herself
with
difficulty
from
showing
a
quaver
*NL*
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
truly
,
this
would
have
been
Carrie
's
attitude
in
any
case
.
She
*NL*
had
looked
back
at
times
upon
her
parting
from
Drouet
and
had
regretted
*NL*
that
she
had
served
him
so
badly
.
She
hoped
she
would
never
meet
him
*NL*
again
,
but
she
was
ashamed
of
her
conduct
.
Not
that
she
had
any
choice
*NL*
in
the
final
separation
.
She
had
gone
willingly
to
seek
him
,
with
*NL*
sympathy
in
her
heart
,
when
Hurstwood
had
reported
him
ill
.
There
was
*NL*
something
cruel
somewhere
,
and
not
being
able
to
track
it
mentally
*NL*
to
its
logical
lair
,
she
concluded
with
feeling
that
he
would
never
*NL*
understand
what
Hurstwood
had
done
and
would
see
hard-hearted
decision
*NL*
in
her
deed
;
hence
her
shame
.
Not
that
she
cared
for
him
.
She
did
not
*NL*
want
to
make
any
one
who
had
been
good
to
her
feel
badly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
realise
what
she
was
doing
by
allowing
these
feelings
to
*NL*
possess
her
.
Hurstwood
,
noticing
the
kindness
,
conceived
better
of
her
.
*NL*
``
Carrie
's
good-natured
,
anyhow
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
to
Miss
Osborne
's
that
afternoon
,
she
found
that
little
lady
*NL*
packing
and
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
come
over
with
me
today
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
'll
be
there
Friday
.
Would
you
mind
*NL*
lending
me
the
twenty-five
dollars
you
spoke
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
''
said
Lola
,
going
for
her
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
get
some
other
things
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
all
right
,
''
answered
the
little
girl
,
good-naturedly
,
glad
*NL*
to
be
of
service
.
It
had
been
days
since
Hurstwood
had
done
more
than
*NL*
go
to
the
grocery
or
to
the
news-stand
.
Now
the
weariness
of
indoors
was
*NL*
upon
him
--
had
been
for
two
days
--
but
chill
,
grey
weather
had
held
him
*NL*
back
.
Friday
broke
fair
and
warm
.
It
was
one
of
those
lovely
harbingers
*NL*
of
spring
,
given
as
a
sign
in
dreary
winter
that
earth
is
not
forsaken
*NL*
of
warmth
and
beauty
.
The
blue
heaven
,
holding
its
one
golden
orb
,
*NL*
poured
down
a
crystal
wash
of
warm
light
.
It
was
plain
,
from
the
voice
*NL*
of
the
sparrows
,
that
all
was
halcyon
outside
.
Carrie
raised
the
front
*NL*
windows
,
and
felt
the
south
wind
blowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
lovely
out
to-day
,
''
she
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
''
said
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
,
he
immediately
got
his
other
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
be
back
for
lunch
?
''
asked
Carrie
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
into
the
streets
and
tramped
north
,
along
Seventh
Avenue
,
*NL*
idly
fixing
upon
the
Harlem
River
as
an
objective
point
.
He
had
seen
*NL*
some
ships
up
there
,
the
time
he
had
called
upon
the
brewers
.
He
*NL*
wondered
how
the
territory
thereabouts
was
growing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
Fifty-ninth
Street
,
he
took
the
west
side
of
Central
Park
,
*NL*
which
he
followed
to
Seventy-eighth
Street
.
Then
he
remembered
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
and
turned
over
to
look
at
the
mass
of
buildings
erected
.
*NL*
It
was
very
much
improved
.
The
great
open
spaces
were
filling
up
.
Coming
*NL*
back
,
he
kept
to
the
Park
until
110th
Street
,
and
then
turned
into
*NL*
Seventh
Avenue
again
,
reaching
the
pretty
river
by
one
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
it
ran
winding
before
his
gaze
,
shining
brightly
in
the
clear
*NL*
light
,
between
the
undulating
banks
on
the
right
and
the
tall
,
*NL*
tree-covered
heights
on
the
left
.
The
spring-like
atmosphere
woke
him
to
*NL*
a
sense
of
its
loveliness
,
and
for
a
few
moments
he
stood
looking
at
it
,
*NL*
folding
his
hands
behind
his
back
.
Then
he
turned
and
followed
it
toward
*NL*
the
east
side
,
idly
seeking
the
ships
he
had
seen
.
It
was
four
o'clock
*NL*
before
the
waning
day
,
with
its
suggestion
of
a
cooler
evening
,
caused
*NL*
him
to
return
.
He
was
hungry
and
would
enjoy
eating
in
the
warm
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
flat
by
half-past
five
,
it
was
still
dark
.
He
knew
*NL*
that
Carrie
was
not
there
,
not
only
because
there
was
no
light
showing
*NL*
through
the
transom
,
but
because
the
evening
papers
were
stuck
between
*NL*
the
outside
knob
and
the
door
.
He
opened
with
his
key
and
went
in
.
*NL*
Everything
was
still
dark
.
Lighting
the
gas
,
he
sat
down
,
preparing
to
*NL*
wait
a
little
while
.
Even
if
Carrie
did
come
now
,
dinner
would
be
late
.
*NL*
He
read
until
six
,
then
got
up
to
fix
something
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
did
so
,
he
noticed
that
the
room
seemed
a
little
queer
.
What
*NL*
was
it
?
He
looked
around
,
as
if
he
missed
something
,
and
then
saw
an
*NL*
envelope
near
where
he
had
been
sitting
.
It
spoke
for
itself
,
almost
*NL*
without
further
action
on
his
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reaching
over
,
he
took
it
,
a
sort
of
chill
settling
upon
him
even
while
*NL*
he
reached
.
The
crackle
of
the
envelope
in
his
hands
was
loud
.
Green
*NL*
paper
money
lay
soft
within
the
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
George
,
''
he
read
,
crunching
the
money
in
one
hand
,
``
I
'm
going
*NL*
away
.
I
'm
not
coming
back
any
more
.
It
's
no
use
trying
to
keep
up
the
*NL*
flat
;
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
I
would
n't
mind
helping
you
,
if
I
could
,
but
I
*NL*
ca
n't
support
us
both
,
and
pay
the
rent
.
I
need
what
little
I
make
to
*NL*
pay
for
my
clothes

I
'm
leaving
twenty
dollars

It
's
all
I
have
just
*NL*
now

You

whatever
you

I

CARRIE

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
the
note
and
looked
quietly
round
.
Now
he
knew
what
he
*NL*
missed
.
It
was
the
little
ornamental
clock
,
which
was
hers
.
It
had
gone
*NL*
from
the
mantelpiece
.
He
went
into
the
front
room
,
his
bedroom
,
the
*NL*
parlour
,
lighting
the
gas
as
he
went
.
From
the
chiffonier
had
gone
*NL*
the
knick-knacks
of
silver
and
plate
.
From
the
table-top
,
the
lace
*NL*
coverings
.
He
opened
the
wardrobe
--
no
clothes
of
hers
.
He
opened
the
*NL*
drawers
--
nothing
of
hers
.
Her
trunk
was
gone
from
its
accustomed
place
.
*NL*
Back
in
his
own
room
hung
his
old
clothes
,
just
as
he
had
left
them
.
*NL*
Nothing
else
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
into
the
parlour
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
looking
vacantly
*NL*
at
the
floor
.
The
silence
grew
oppressive
.
The
little
flat
seemed
*NL*
wonderfully
deserted
.
He
wholly
forgot
that
he
was
hungry
,
that
it
was
*NL*
only
dinner-time
.
It
seemed
later
in
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
he
found
that
the
money
was
still
in
his
hands
.
There
were
*NL*
twenty
dollars
in
all
,
as
she
had
said
.
Now
he
walked
back
,
leaving
the
*NL*
lights
ablaze
,
and
feeling
as
if
the
flat
were
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
get
out
of
this
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
sheer
loneliness
of
his
situation
rushed
upon
him
in
full
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Left
me
!
''
he
muttered
,
and
repeated
,
``
left
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
that
had
been
so
comfortable
,
where
he
had
spent
so
many
days
*NL*
of
warmth
,
was
now
a
memory
.
Something
colder
and
chillier
confronted
*NL*
him
.
He
sank
down
in
his
chair
,
resting
his
chin
in
his
hand
--
mere
*NL*
sensation
,
without
thought
,
holding
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
something
like
a
bereaved
affection
and
self-pity
swept
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
need
n't
have
gone
away
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'd
have
got
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
a
long
while
without
rocking
,
and
added
quite
clearly
,
out
loud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tried
,
did
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
midnight
he
was
still
rocking
,
staring
at
the
floor
.

THE
WORLD
TURNS
FLATTERER
--
AN
EYE
IN
THE
DARK
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Installed
in
her
comfortable
room
,
Carrie
wondered
how
Hurstwood
had
*NL*
taken
her
departure
.
She
arranged
a
few
things
hastily
and
then
left
for
*NL*
the
theatre
,
half
expecting
to
encounter
him
at
the
door
.
Not
finding
*NL*
him
,
her
dread
lifted
,
and
she
felt
more
kindly
toward
him
.
She
quite
*NL*
forgot
him
until
about
to
come
out
,
after
the
show
,
when
the
chance
of
*NL*
his
being
there
frightened
her
.
As
day
after
day
passed
and
she
heard
*NL*
nothing
at
all
,
the
thought
of
being
bothered
by
him
passed
.
In
a
little
*NL*
while
she
was
,
except
for
occasional
thoughts
,
wholly
free
of
the
gloom
*NL*
with
which
her
life
had
been
weighed
in
the
flat
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
curious
to
note
how
quickly
a
profession
absorbs
one
.
Carrie
*NL*
became
wise
in
theatrical
lore
,
hearing
the
gossip
of
little
Lola
.
She
*NL*
learned
what
the
theatrical
papers
were
,
which
ones
published
items
*NL*
about
actresses
and
the
like
.
She
began
to
read
the
newspaper
notices
,
*NL*
not
only
of
the
opera
in
which
she
had
so
small
a
part
,
but
of
others
.
*NL*
Gradually
the
desire
for
notice
took
hold
of
her
.
She
longed
to
be
*NL*
renowned
like
others
,
and
read
with
avidity
all
the
complimentary
or
*NL*
critical
comments
made
concerning
others
high
in
her
profession
.
The
*NL*
showy
world
in
which
her
interest
lay
completely
absorbed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
this
time
that
the
newspapers
and
magazines
were
beginning
*NL*
to
pay
that
illustrative
attention
to
the
beauties
of
the
stage
which
*NL*
has
since
become
fervid
.
The
newspapers
,
and
particularly
the
Sunday
*NL*
newspapers
,
indulged
in
large
decorative
theatrical
pages
,
in
which
the
*NL*
faces
and
forms
of
well-known
theatrical
celebrities
appeared
,
enclosed
*NL*
with
artistic
scrolls
.
The
magazines
also
or
at
least
one
or
two
of
the
*NL*
newer
ones
--
published
occasional
portraits
of
pretty
stars
,
and
now
and
*NL*
again
photos
of
scenes
from
various
plays
.
Carrie
watched
these
with
*NL*
growing
interest
.
When
would
a
scene
from
her
opera
appear
?
When
would
*NL*
some
paper
think
her
photo
worth
while
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sunday
before
taking
her
new
part
she
scanned
the
theatrical
pages
*NL*
for
some
little
notice
.
It
would
have
accorded
with
her
expectations
if
*NL*
nothing
had
been
said
,
but
there
in
the
squibs
,
tailing
off
several
*NL*
more
substantial
items
,
was
a
wee
notice
.
Carrie
read
it
with
a
tingling
*NL*
body
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
part
of
Katisha
,
the
country
maid
,
in
`
The
Wives
of
Abdul
'
at
the
*NL*
Broadway
,
heretofore
played
by
Inez
Carew
,
will
be
hereafter
filled
by
*NL*
Carrie
Madenda
,
one
of
the
cleverest
members
of
the
chorus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
hugged
herself
with
delight
.
Oh
,
was
n't
it
just
fine
!
At
last
!
*NL*
The
first
,
the
long-hoped
for
,
the
delightful
notice
!
And
they
called
*NL*
her
clever
.
She
could
hardly
restrain
herself
from
laughing
loudly
.
Had
*NL*
Lola
seen
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
got
a
notice
here
of
the
part
I
'm
going
to
play
to-morrow
*NL*
night
,
''
said
Carrie
to
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
jolly
!
Have
they
?
''
cried
Lola
,
running
to
her
.
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
looking
.
``
You
'll
get
more
now
,
if
you
do
well
.
I
had
my
*NL*
picture
in
the
`
World
'
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
?
Well
,
I
should
say
,
''
returned
the
little
girl
.
``
They
had
a
frame
*NL*
around
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
never
published
my
picture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
will
,
''
said
Lola
.
``
You
'll
see
.
You
do
better
than
most
that
*NL*
get
theirs
in
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
felt
deeply
grateful
for
this
.
She
almost
loved
Lola
for
the
*NL*
sympathy
and
praise
she
extended
.
It
was
so
helpful
to
her
--
so
almost
*NL*
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fulfilling
her
part
capably
brought
another
notice
in
the
papers
that
*NL*
she
was
doing
her
work
acceptably
.
This
pleased
her
immensely
.
She
began
*NL*
to
think
the
world
was
taking
note
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
week
she
got
her
thirty-five
dollars
,
it
seemed
an
enormous
*NL*
sum
.
Paying
only
three
dollars
for
room
rent
seemed
ridiculous
.
After
*NL*
giving
Lola
her
twenty-five
,
she
still
had
seven
dollars
left
.
With
four
*NL*
left
over
from
previous
earnings
,
she
had
eleven
.
Five
of
this
went
to
*NL*
pay
the
regular
installment
on
the
clothes
she
had
to
buy
.
The
next
week
*NL*
she
was
even
in
greater
feather
.
Now
,
only
three
dollars
need
be
paid
*NL*
for
room
rent
and
five
on
her
clothes
.
The
rest
she
had
for
food
and
her
*NL*
own
whims
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
save
a
little
for
summer
,
''
cautioned
Lola
.
``
We
'll
probably
*NL*
close
in
May
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
intend
to
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
regular
entrance
of
thirty-five
dollars
a
week
to
one
who
has
*NL*
endured
scant
allowances
for
several
years
is
a
demoralising
thing
.
*NL*
Carrie
found
her
purse
bursting
with
good
green
bills
of
comfortable
*NL*
denominations
.
Having
no
one
dependent
upon
her
,
she
began
to
buy
pretty
*NL*
clothes
and
pleasing
trinkets
,
to
eat
well
,
and
to
ornament
her
room
.
*NL*
Friends
were
not
long
in
gathering
about
.
She
met
a
few
young
men
who
*NL*
belonged
to
Lola
's
staff
.
The
members
of
the
opera
company
made
her
*NL*
acquaintance
without
the
formality
of
introduction
.
One
of
these
*NL*
discovered
a
fancy
for
her
.
On
several
occasions
he
strolled
home
with
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
stop
in
and
have
a
rarebit
,
''
he
suggested
one
midnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
rosy
restaurant
,
filled
with
the
merry
lovers
of
late
hours
,
*NL*
she
found
herself
criticising
this
man
.
He
was
too
stilted
,
too
*NL*
self-opinionated
.
He
did
not
talk
of
anything
that
lifted
her
above
the
*NL*
common
run
of
clothes
and
material
success
.
When
it
was
all
over
,
he
*NL*
smiled
most
graciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
to
go
straight
home
,
have
you
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
,
with
an
air
of
quiet
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
so
inexperienced
as
she
looks
,
''
he
thought
,
and
thereafter
*NL*
his
respect
and
ardour
were
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
help
sharing
in
Lola
's
love
for
a
good
time
.
There
were
*NL*
days
when
they
went
carriage
riding
,
nights
when
after
the
show
they
*NL*
dined
,
afternoons
when
they
strolled
along
Broadway
,
tastefully
dressed
.
*NL*
She
was
getting
in
the
metropolitan
whirl
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
her
picture
appeared
in
one
of
the
weeklies
.
She
had
not
known
*NL*
of
it
,
and
it
took
her
breath
.
``
Miss
Carrie
Madenda
,
''
it
was
labelled
.
*NL*
``
One
of
the
favourites
of
`
The
Wives
of
Abdul
'
company
.
''
At
Lola
's
*NL*
advice
she
had
had
some
pictures
taken
by
Sarony
.
They
had
got
one
*NL*
there
.
She
thought
of
going
down
and
buying
a
few
copies
of
the
paper
,
*NL*
but
remembered
that
there
was
no
one
she
knew
well
enough
to
send
them
*NL*
to
.
Only
Lola
,
apparently
,
in
all
the
world
was
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
metropolis
is
a
cold
place
socially
,
and
Carrie
soon
found
that
a
*NL*
little
money
brought
her
nothing
.
The
world
of
wealth
and
distinction
*NL*
was
quite
as
far
away
as
ever
.
She
could
feel
that
there
was
no
warm
,
*NL*
sympathetic
friendship
back
of
the
easy
merriment
with
which
many
*NL*
approached
her
.
All
seemed
to
be
seeking
their
own
amusement
,
regardless
*NL*
of
the
possible
sad
consequence
to
others
.
So
much
for
the
lessons
of
*NL*
Hurstwood
and
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
April
she
learned
that
the
opera
would
probably
last
until
the
middle
*NL*
or
the
end
of
May
,
according
to
the
size
of
the
audiences
.
Next
season
*NL*
it
would
go
on
the
road
.
She
wondered
if
she
would
be
with
it
.
As
usual
,
*NL*
Miss
Osborne
,
owing
to
her
moderate
salary
,
was
for
securing
a
home
*NL*
engagement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
putting
on
a
summer
play
at
the
Casino
,
''
she
announced
,
after
*NL*
figuratively
putting
her
ear
to
the
ground
.
``
Let
's
try
and
get
in
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
willing
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
tried
in
time
and
were
apprised
of
the
proper
date
to
apply
again
.
*NL*
That
was
May
16th
.
Meanwhile
their
own
show
closed
May
5th
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
that
want
to
go
with
the
show
next
season
,
''
said
the
manager
,
*NL*
``
will
have
to
sign
this
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
sign
,
''
advised
Lola
.
``
I
would
n't
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
but
maybe
I
ca
n't
get
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
wo
n't
,
''
said
the
little
girl
,
who
had
a
resource
in
her
*NL*
admirers
.
``
I
went
once
and
I
did
n't
have
anything
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
season
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
thought
this
over
.
She
had
never
been
on
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
get
along
,
''
added
Lola
.
``
I
always
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
did
not
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manager
who
was
putting
on
the
summer
skit
at
the
Casino
had
never
*NL*
heard
of
Carrie
,
but
the
several
notices
she
had
received
,
her
published
*NL*
picture
,
and
the
programme
bearing
her
name
had
some
little
weight
with
*NL*
him
.
He
gave
her
a
silent
part
at
thirty
dollars
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
tell
you
?
''
said
Lola
.
``
It
does
n't
do
you
any
good
to
go
away
*NL*
from

all

*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
because
Carrie
was
pretty
,
the
gentlemen
who
made
up
the
advance
*NL*
illustrations
of
shows
about
to
appear
for
the
Sunday
papers
selected
*NL*
Carrie
's
photo
along
with
others
to
illustrate
the
announcement
.
Because
*NL*
she
was
very
pretty
,
they
gave
it
excellent
space
and
drew
scrolls
about
*NL*
it
.
Carrie
was
delighted
.
Still
,
the
management
did
not
seem
to
have
*NL*
seen
anything
of
it
.
At
least
,
no
more
attention
was
paid
to
her
than
*NL*
before
.
At
the
same
time
there
seemed
very
little
in
her
part
.
It
*NL*
consisted
of
standing
around
in
all
sorts
of
scenes
,
a
silent
little
*NL*
Quakeress
.
The
author
of
the
skit
had
fancied
that
a
great
deal
could
be
*NL*
made
of
such
a
part
,
given
to
the
right
actress
,
but
now
,
since
it
had
*NL*
been
doled
out
to
Carrie
,
he
would
as
leave
have
had
it
cut
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
kick
,
old
man
,
''
remarked
the
manager
.
``
If
it
do
n't
go
the
first
*NL*
week
we
will
cut
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
had
no
warning
of
this
halcyon
intention
.
She
practised
her
*NL*
part
ruefully
,
feeling
that
she
was
effectually
shelved
.
At
the
dress
*NL*
rehearsal
she
was
disconsolate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
n't
so
bad
,
''
said
the
author
,
the
manager
noting
the
curious
*NL*
effect
which
Carrie
's
blues
had
upon
the
part
.
``
Tell
her
to
frown
a
*NL*
little
more
when
Sparks
dances
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
did
not
know
it
,
but
there
was
the
least
show
of
wrinkles
between
*NL*
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
was
puckered
quaintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frown
a
little
more
,
Miss
Madenda
,
''
said
the
stage
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
instantly
brightened
up
,
thinking
he
had
meant
it
as
a
rebuke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
frown
,
''
he
said
.
``
Frown
as
you
did
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
it
,
''
he
said
.
``
Frown
hard
when
Mr.
Sparks
dances
.
I
want
to
see
*NL*
how
it
looks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
enough
to
do
.
Carrie
scowled
.
The
effect
was
something
so
*NL*
quaint
and
droll
it
caught
even
the
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
good
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
she
'll
do
that
all
through
,
I
think
it
will
*NL*
take
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Going
over
to
Carrie
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
you
try
frowning
all
through
.
Do
it
hard
.
Look
mad
.
It
'll
make
*NL*
the
part
really
funny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
opening
night
it
looked
to
Carrie
as
if
there
were
nothing
to
her
*NL*
part
,
after
all
.
The
happy
,
sweltering
audience
did
not
seem
to
see
her
*NL*
in
the
first
act
.
She
frowned
and
frowned
,
but
to
no
effect
.
Eyes
were
*NL*
riveted
upon
the
more
elaborate
efforts
of
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
act
,
the
crowd
,
wearied
by
a
dull
conversation
,
roved
with
*NL*
its
eyes
about
the
stage
and
sighted
her
.
There
she
was
,
grey-suited
,
*NL*
sweet-faced
,
demure
,
but
scowling
.
At
first
the
general
idea
was
that
*NL*
she
was
temporarily
irritated
,
that
the
look
was
genuine
and
not
fun
at
*NL*
all
.
As
she
went
on
frowning
,
looking
now
at
one
principal
and
now
at
*NL*
the
other
,
the
audience
began
to
smile
.
The
portly
gentlemen
in
the
*NL*
front
rows
began
to
feel
that
she
was
a
delicious
little
morsel
.
It
was
*NL*
the
kind
of
frown
they
would
have
loved
to
force
away
with
kisses
.
All
*NL*
the
gentlemen
yearned
toward
her
.
She
was
capital
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
the
chief
comedian
,
singing
in
the
centre
of
the
stage
,
noticed
*NL*
a
giggle
where
it
was
not
expected
.
Then
another
and
another
.
When
the
*NL*
place
came
for
loud
applause
it
was
only
moderate
.
What
could
be
the
*NL*
trouble
?
He
realised
that
something
was
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
after
an
exit
,
he
caught
sight
of
Carrie
.
She
was
frowning
*NL*
alone
on
the
stage
and
the
audience
was
giggling
and
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
George
,
I
wo
n't
stand
that
!
''
thought
the
thespian
.
``
I
'm
not
going
to
*NL*
have
my
work
cut
up
by
some
one
else
.
Either
she
quits
that
when
I
do
my
*NL*
turn
or
I
quit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
's
all
right
,
''
said
the
manager
,
when
the
kick
came
.
``
That
's
*NL*
what
she
's
supposed
to
do
.
You
need
n't
pay
any
attention
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
ruins
my
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
do
n't
,
''
returned
the
former
,
soothingly
.
``
It
's
only
a
little
*NL*
fun
on
the
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
eh
?
''
exclaimed
the
big
comedian
.
``
She
killed
my
hand
all
right
.
*NL*
I
'm
not
going
to
stand
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
wait
until
after
the
show
.
Wait
until
to-morrow
.
We
'll
see
what
*NL*
we
can
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
act
,
however
,
settled
what
was
to
be
done
.
Carrie
was
the
chief
*NL*
feature
of
the
play
.
The
audience
,
the
more
it
studied
her
,
the
more
*NL*
it
indicated
its
delight
.
Every
other
feature
paled
beside
the
quaint
,
*NL*
teasing
,
delightful
atmosphere
which
Carrie
contributed
while
on
the
*NL*
stage
.
Manager
and
company
realised
she
had
made
a
hit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
critics
of
the
daily
papers
completed
her
triumph
.
There
were
*NL*
long
notices
in
praise
of
the
quality
of
the
burlesque
,
touched
with
*NL*
recurrent
references
to
Carrie
.
The
contagious
mirth
of
the
thing
was
*NL*
repeatedly
emphasised
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Madenda
presents
one
of
the
most
delightful
bits
of
character
work
*NL*
ever
seen
on
the
Casino
stage
,
''
observed
the
stage
critic
of
the
``
Sun
.
''
*NL*
``
It
is
a
bit
of
quiet
,
unassuming
drollery
which
warms
like
good
wine
.
*NL*
Evidently
the
part
was
not
intended
to
take
precedence
,
as
Miss
Madenda
*NL*
is
not
often
on
the
stage
,
but
the
audience
,
with
the
characteristic
*NL*
perversity
of
such
bodies
,
selected
for
itself
.
The
little
Quakeress
was
*NL*
marked
for
a
favourite
the
moment
she
appeared
,
and
thereafter
easily
*NL*
held
attention
and
applause
.
The
vagaries
of
fortune
are
indeed
*NL*
curious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
critic
of
the
``
Evening
World
,
''
seeking
as
usual
to
establish
a
catch
*NL*
phrase
which
should
``
go
''
with
the
town
,
wound
up
by
advising
:
``
If
you
*NL*
wish
to
be
merry
,
see
Carrie
frown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
was
miraculous
so
far
as
Carrie
's
fortune
was
concerned
.
*NL*
Even
during
the
morning
she
received
a
congratulatory
message
from
the
*NL*
manager
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
have
taken
the
town
by
storm
,
''
he
wrote
.
``
This
is
*NL*
delightful
.
I
am
as
glad
for
your
sake
as
for
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
author
also
sent
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
when
she
entered
the
theatre
the
manager
had
a
most
*NL*
pleasant
greeting
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Stevens
,
''
he
said
,
referring
to
the
author
,
``
is
preparing
a
little
*NL*
song
,
which
he
would
like
you
to
sing
next
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
sing
,
''
returned
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
anything
difficult
.
`
It
's
something
that
is
very
simple
,
'
he
*NL*
says
,
`
and
would
suit
you
exactly
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
would
n't
mind
trying
,
''
said
Carrie
,
archly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
mind
coming
to
the
box-office
a
few
moments
before
you
*NL*
dress
?
''
observed
the
manager
,
in
addition
.
``
There
's
a
little
matter
I
*NL*
want
to
speak
to
you
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
replied
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
latter
place
the
manager
produced
a
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
of
course
,
''
he
said
,
``
we
want
to
be
fair
with
you
in
the
matter
of
*NL*
salary
.
Your
contract
here
only
calls
for
thirty
dollars
a
week
for
*NL*
the
next
three
months
.
How
would
it
do
to
make
it
,
say
,
one
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
a
week
and
extend
it
for
twelve
months
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
''
said
Carrie
,
scarcely
believing
her
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Supposing
,
then
,
you
just
sign
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
and
beheld
a
new
contract
made
out
like
the
other
one
,
*NL*
with
the
exception
of
the
new
figures
of
salary
and
time
.
With
a
hand
*NL*
trembling
from
excitement
she
affixed
her
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
hundred
and
fifty
a
week
!
''
she
murmured
,
when
she
was
again
alone
.
*NL*
She
found
,
after
all
--
as
what
millionaire
has
not
?
--
that
there
was
no
*NL*
realising
,
in
consciousness
,
the
meaning
of
large
sums
.
It
was
only
a
*NL*
shimmering
,
glittering
phrase
in
which
lay
a
world
of
possibilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down
in
a
third-rate
Bleecker
Street
hotel
,
the
brooding
Hurstwood
read
*NL*
the
dramatic
item
covering
Carrie
's
success
,
without
at
first
realising
*NL*
who
was
meant
.
Then
suddenly
it
came
to
him
and
he
read
the
whole
thing
*NL*
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
her
,
all
right
,
I
guess
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
looked
about
upon
a
dingy
,
moth-eaten
hotel
lobby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
she
's
struck
it
,
''
he
thought
,
a
picture
of
the
old
shiny
,
*NL*
plush-covered
world
coming
back
,
with
its
lights
,
its
ornaments
,
its
*NL*
carriages
,
and
flowers
.
Ah
,
she
was
in
the
walled
city
now
!
Its
splendid
*NL*
gates
had
opened
,
admitting
her
from
a
cold
,
dreary
outside
.
She
seemed
*NL*
a
creature
afar
off
--
like
every
other
celebrity
he
had
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
her
have
it
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
wo
n't
bother
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
grim
resolution
of
a
bent
,
bedraggled
,
but
unbroken
pride
.

Chapter
XLIV
.
AND
THIS
IS
NOT
ELF
LAND
--
WHAT
GOLD
WILL
NOT
BUY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carrie
got
back
on
the
stage
,
she
found
that
over
night
her
*NL*
dressing-room
had
been
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
to
use
this
room
,
Miss
Madenda
,
''
said
one
of
the
stage
lackeys
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
longer
any
need
of
climbing
several
flights
of
steps
to
a
small
*NL*
coop
shared
with
another
.
Instead
,
a
comparatively
large
and
commodious
*NL*
chamber
with
conveniences
not
enjoyed
by
the
small
fry
overhead
.
She
*NL*
breathed
deeply
and
with
delight
.
Her
sensations
were
more
physical
than
*NL*
mental
.
In
fact
,
she
was
scarcely
thinking
at
all
.
Heart
and
body
were
*NL*
having
their
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
the
deference
and
congratulation
gave
her
a
mental
*NL*
appreciation
of
her
state
.
She
was
no
longer
ordered
,
but
requested
,
and
*NL*
that
politely
.
The
other
members
of
the
cast
looked
at
her
enviously
as
*NL*
she
came
out
arrayed
in
her
simple
habit
,
which
she
wore
all
through
*NL*
the
play
.
All
those
who
had
supposedly
been
her
equals
and
superiors
*NL*
now
smiled
the
smile
of
sociability
,
as
much
as
to
say
:
``
How
friendly
we
*NL*
have
always
been
.
''
Only
the
star
comedian
whose
part
had
been
so
deeply
*NL*
injured
stalked
by
himself
.
Figuratively
,
he
could
not
kiss
the
hand
*NL*
that
smote
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doing
her
simple
part
,
Carrie
gradually
realised
the
meaning
of
the
*NL*
applause
which
was
for
her
,
and
it
was
sweet
.
She
felt
mildly
guilty
of
*NL*
something
--
perhaps
unworthiness
.
When
her
associates
addressed
her
in
*NL*
the
wings
she
only
smiled
weakly
.
The
pride
and
daring
of
place
were
not
*NL*
for
her
.
It
never
once
crossed
her
mind
to
be
reserved
or
haughty
--
to
*NL*
be
other
than
she
had
been
.
After
the
performances
she
rode
to
her
room
*NL*
with
Lola
,
in
a
carriage
provided
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
a
week
in
which
the
first
fruits
of
success
were
offered
to
*NL*
her
lips
--
bowl
after
bowl
.
It
did
not
matter
that
her
splendid
salary
*NL*
had
not
begun
.
The
world
seemed
satisfied
with
the
promise
.
She
began
*NL*
to
get
letters
and
cards
.
A
Mr.
Withers
--
whom
she
did
not
know
from
*NL*
Adam
--
having
learned
by
some
hook
or
crook
where
she
resided
,
bowed
*NL*
himself
politely
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
excuse
me
for
intruding
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
have
you
been
thinking
*NL*
of
changing
your
apartments
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
n't
thought
of
it
,
''
returned
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
connected
with
the
Wellington
--
the
new
hotel
on
Broadway
.
*NL*
You
have
probably
seen
notices
of
it
in
the
papers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
recognised
the
name
as
standing
for
one
of
the
newest
and
most
*NL*
imposing
hostelries
.
She
had
heard
it
spoken
of
as
having
a
splendid
*NL*
restaurant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
went
on
Mr.
Withers
,
accepting
her
acknowledgment
of
*NL*
familiarity
.
``
We
have
some
very
elegant
rooms
at
present
which
we
would
*NL*
like
to
have
you
look
at
,
if
you
have
not
made
up
your
mind
where
you
*NL*
intend
to
reside
for
the
summer
.
Our
apartments
are
perfect
in
every
*NL*
detail
--
hot
and
cold
water
,
private
baths
,
special
hall
service
for
*NL*
every
floor
,
elevators
,
and
all
that
.
You
know
what
our
restaurant
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
quietly
.
She
was
wondering
whether
he
took
her
to
*NL*
be
a
millionaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
your
rates
?
''
she
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
that
is
what
I
came
to
talk
with
you
privately
about
.
Our
*NL*
regular
rates
are
anywhere
from
three
to
fifty
dollars
a
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
''
interrupted
Carrie
.
``
I
could
n't
pay
any
such
rate
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
how
you
feel
about
it
,
''
exclaimed
Mr.
Withers
,
halting
.
``
But
*NL*
just
let
me
explain
.
I
said
those
are
our
regular
rates
.
Like
every
*NL*
other
hotel
we
make
special
ones
however
.
Possibly
you
have
not
thought
*NL*
about
it
,
but
your
name
is
worth
something
to
us
.
''
``
Oh
!
''
ejaculated
*NL*
Carrie
,
seeing
at
a
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
Every
hotel
depends
upon
the
repute
of
its
patrons
.
A
*NL*
well-known
actress
like
yourself
,
''
and
he
bowed
politely
,
while
Carrie
*NL*
flushed
,
``
draws
attention
to
the
hotel
,
and
--
although
you
may
not
*NL*
believe
it
--
patrons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
returned
Carrie
,
vacantly
,
trying
to
arrange
this
curious
*NL*
proposition
in
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
continued
Mr.
Withers
,
swaying
his
derby
hat
softly
and
beating
*NL*
one
of
his
polished
shoes
upon
the
floor
,
``
I
want
to
arrange
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
to
have
you
come
and
stop
at
the
Wellington
.
You
need
not
*NL*
trouble
about
terms
.
In
fact
,
we
need
hardly
discuss
them
.
Anything
*NL*
will
do
for
the
summer
--
a
mere
figure
--
anything
that
you
think
you
could
*NL*
afford
to
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
was
about
to
interrupt
,
but
he
gave
her
no
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
come
to-day
or
to-morrow
--
the
earlier
the
better
--
and
we
will
*NL*
give
you
your
choice
of
nice
,
light
,
outside
rooms
--
the
very
best
we
*NL*
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
very
kind
,
''
said
Carrie
,
touched
by
the
agent
's
extreme
*NL*
affability
.
``
I
should
like
to
come
very
much
.
I
would
want
to
pay
what
*NL*
is
right
,
however
.
I
should
n't
want
to
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
trouble
about
that
at
all
,
''
interrupted
Mr.
Withers
.
*NL*
``
We
can
arrange
that
to
your
entire
satisfaction
at
any
time
.
If
three
*NL*
dollars
a
day
is
satisfactory
to
you
,
it
will
be
so
to
us
.
All
you
have
*NL*
to
do
is
to
pay
that
sum
to
the
clerk
at
the
end
of
the
week
or
month
,
*NL*
just
as
you
wish
,
and
he
will
give
you
a
receipt
for
what
the
rooms
*NL*
would
cost
if
charged
for
at
our
regular
rates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
speaker
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
you
come
and
look
at
the
rooms
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
be
glad
to
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
but
I
have
a
rehearsal
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
mean
at
once
,
''
he
returned
.
``
Any
time
will
do
.
Would
this
*NL*
afternoon
be
inconvenient
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
remembered
Lola
,
who
was
out
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
room-mate
,
''
she
added
,
``
who
will
have
to
go
wherever
I
do
.
I
*NL*
forgot
about
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
''
said
Mr.
Withers
,
blandly
.
``
It
is
for
you
to
say
whom
*NL*
you
want
with
you
.
As
I
say
,
all
that
can
be
arranged
to
suit
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bowed
and
backed
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
four
,
then
,
we
may
expect
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
be
there
to
show
you
,
''
and
so
Mr.
Withers
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
rehearsal
Carrie
informed
Lola
.
``
Did
they
really
?
''
exclaimed
the
*NL*
latter
,
thinking
of
the
Wellington
as
a
group
of
managers
.
``
Is
n't
that
*NL*
fine
?
Oh
,
jolly
!
It
's
so
swell
.
That
's
where
we
dined
that
night
we
went
*NL*
with
those
two
Cushing
boys
.
Do
n't
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
as
fine
as
it
can
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'd
better
be
going
up
there
,
''
observed
Carrie
later
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rooms
which
Mr.
Withers
displayed
to
Carrie
and
Lola
were
three
and
*NL*
bath
--
a
suite
on
the
parlour
floor
.
They
were
done
in
chocolate
and
dark
*NL*
red
,
with
rugs
and
hangings
to
match
.
Three
windows
looked
down
into
*NL*
busy
Broadway
on
the
east
,
three
into
a
side
street
which
crossed
there
.
*NL*
There
were
two
lovely
bedrooms
,
set
with
brass
and
white
enamel
beds
,
*NL*
white
ribbon-trimmed
chairs
and
chiffoniers
to
match
.
In
the
third
room
,
*NL*
or
parlour
,
was
a
piano
,
a
heavy
piano
lamp
,
with
a
shade
of
gorgeous
*NL*
pattern
,
a
library
table
,
several
huge
easy
rockers
,
some
dado
book
*NL*
shelves
,
and
a
gilt
curio
case
,
filled
with
oddities
.
Pictures
were
upon
*NL*
the
walls
,
soft
Turkish
pillows
upon
the
divan
footstools
of
brown
plush
*NL*
upon
the
floor
.
Such
accommodations
would
ordinarily
cost
a
hundred
*NL*
dollars
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
lovely
!
''
exclaimed
Lola
,
walking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
comfortable
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
was
lifting
a
lace
curtain
and
*NL*
looking
down
into
crowded
Broadway
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bath
was
a
handsome
affair
,
done
in
white
enamel
,
with
a
large
,
*NL*
blue-bordered
stone
tub
and
nickel
trimmings
.
It
was
bright
and
*NL*
commodious
,
with
a
bevelled
mirror
set
in
the
wall
at
one
end
and
*NL*
incandescent
lights
arranged
in
three
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
find
these
satisfactory
?
''
observed
Mr.
Withers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
,
''
answered
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
any
time
you
find
it
convenient
to
move
in
,
they
are
ready
.
*NL*
The
boy
will
bring
you
the
keys
at
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
noted
the
elegantly
carpeted
and
decorated
hall
,
the
marbled
*NL*
lobby
,
and
showy
waiting-room
.
It
was
such
a
place
as
she
had
often
*NL*
dreamed
of
occupying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
we
'd
better
move
right
away
,
do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
she
observed
*NL*
to
Lola
,
thinking
of
the
commonplace
chamber
in
Seventeenth
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
by
all
means
,
''
said
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
her
trunks
left
for
the
new
abode
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dressing
,
after
the
matinee
on
Wednesday
,
a
knock
came
at
her
*NL*
dressing-room
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
the
card
handed
by
the
boy
and
suffered
a
shock
of
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
her
I
'll
be
right
out
,
''
she
said
softly
.
Then
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
card
,
added
:
``
Mrs.
Vance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
little
sinner
,
''
the
latter
exclaimed
,
as
she
saw
Carrie
coming
*NL*
toward
her
across
the
now
vacant
stage
.
``
How
in
the
world
did
this
*NL*
happen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
laughed
merrily
.
There
was
no
trace
of
embarrassment
in
her
*NL*
friend
's
manner
.
You
would
have
thought
that
the
long
separation
had
*NL*
come
about
accidentally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
returned
Carrie
,
warming
,
in
spite
of
her
first
troubled
*NL*
feelings
,
toward
this
handsome
,
good-natured
young
matron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
,
I
saw
your
picture
in
the
Sunday
paper
,
but
your
name
*NL*
threw
me
off
.
I
thought
it
must
be
you
or
somebody
that
looked
just
like
*NL*
you
,
and
I
said
:
`
Well
,
now
,
I
will
go
right
down
there
and
see
.
'
I
was
*NL*
never
more
surprised
in
my
life
.
How
are
you
,
anyway
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
''
returned
Carrie
.
``
How
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
.
But
are
n't
you
a
success
!
Dear
,
oh
!
All
the
papers
talking
about
*NL*
you
.
I
should
think
you
would
be
just
too
proud
to
breathe
.
I
was
almost
*NL*
afraid
to
come
back
here
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nonsense
,
''
said
Carrie
,
blushing
.
``
You
know
I
'd
be
glad
to
see
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
anyhow
,
here
you
are
.
Ca
n't
you
come
up
and
take
dinner
with
me
*NL*
now
?
Where
are
you
stopping
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Wellington
,
''
said
Carrie
,
who
permitted
herself
a
touch
of
pride
*NL*
in
the
acknowledgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
are
you
?
''
exclaimed
the
other
,
upon
whom
the
name
was
not
without
*NL*
its
proper
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tactfully
,
Mrs.
Vance
avoided
the
subject
of
Hurstwood
,
of
whom
she
*NL*
could
not
help
thinking
.
No
doubt
Carrie
had
left
him
.
That
much
she
*NL*
surmised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
think
I
can
,
''
said
Carrie
,
``
to-night
.
I
have
so
little
*NL*
time
.
I
must
be
back
here
by
7.30
.
Wo
n't
you
come
and
dine
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
be
delighted
,
but
I
ca
n't
to-night
,
''
said
Mrs.
Vance
studying
*NL*
Carrie
's
fine
appearance
.
The
latter
's
good
fortune
made
her
seem
*NL*
more
than
ever
worthy
and
delightful
in
the
others
eyes
.
``
I
promised
*NL*
faithfully
to
be
home
at
six
.
''
Glancing
at
the
small
gold
watch
pinned
*NL*
to
her
bosom
,
she
added
:
``
I
must
be
going
,
too
.
Tell
me
when
you
're
*NL*
coming
up
,
if
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
any
time
you
like
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
to-morrow
then
.
I
'm
living
at
the
Chelsea
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moved
again
?
''
exclaimed
Carrie
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
You
know
I
ca
n't
stay
six
months
in
one
place
.
I
just
have
to
*NL*
move
.
Remember
now
--
half-past
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
forget
,
''
said
Carrie
,
casting
a
glance
at
her
as
she
went
away
.
*NL*
Then
it
came
to
her
that
she
was
as
good
as
this
woman
now
--
perhaps
*NL*
better
.
Something
in
the
other
's
solicitude
and
interest
made
her
feel
*NL*
as
if
she
were
the
one
to
condescend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
on
each
preceding
day
,
letters
were
handed
her
by
the
doorman
at
*NL*
the
Casino
.
This
was
a
feature
which
had
rapidly
developed
since
Monday
.
*NL*
What
they
contained
she
well
knew
.
MASH
NOTES
were
old
affairs
in
their
*NL*
mildest
form
.
She
remembered
having
received
her
first
one
far
back
*NL*
in
Columbia
City
.
Since
then
,
as
a
chorus
girl
,
she
had
received
*NL*
others
--
gentlemen
who
prayed
for
an
engagement
.
They
were
common
sport
*NL*
between
her
and
Lola
,
who
received
some
also
.
They
both
frequently
made
*NL*
light
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
however
,
they
came
thick
and
fast
.
Gentlemen
with
fortunes
did
*NL*
not
hesitate
to
note
,
as
an
addition
to
their
own
amiable
collection
of
*NL*
virtues
,
that
they
had
their
horses
and
carriages
.
Thus
one
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
million
in
my
own
right
.
I
could
give
you
every
luxury
.
There
*NL*
is
n't
anything
you
could
ask
for
that
you
could
n't
have
.
I
say
this
,
not
*NL*
because
I
want
to
speak
of
my
money
,
but
because
I
love
you
and
wish
to
*NL*
gratify
your
every
desire
.
It
is
love
that
prompts
me
to
write
.
Will
you
*NL*
not
give
me
one
half-hour
in
which
to
plead
my
cause
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Such
of
these
letters
as
came
while
Carrie
was
still
in
the
Seventeenth
*NL*
Street
place
were
read
with
more
interest
--
though
never
delight
--
than
*NL*
those
which
arrived
after
she
was
installed
in
her
luxurious
quarters
at
*NL*
the
Wellington
.
Even
there
her
vanity
--
or
that
self-appreciation
which
,
*NL*
in
its
more
rabid
form
,
is
called
vanity
--
was
not
sufficiently
cloyed
to
*NL*
make
these
things
wearisome
.
Adulation
,
being
new
in
any
form
,
pleased
*NL*
her
.
Only
she
was
sufficiently
wise
to
distinguish
between
her
old
*NL*
condition
and
her
new
one
.
She
had
not
had
fame
or
money
before
.
Now
*NL*
they
had
come
.
She
had
not
had
adulation
and
affectionate
propositions
*NL*
before
.
Now
they
had
come
.
Wherefore
?
She
smiled
to
think
that
men
*NL*
should
suddenly
find
her
so
much
more
attractive
.
In
the
least
way
it
*NL*
incited
her
to
coolness
and
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
look
here
,
''
she
remarked
to
Lola
.
``
See
what
this
man
says
:
`
If
*NL*
you
will
only
deign
to
grant
me
one
half-hour
,
'
''
she
repeated
,
with
an

He

``
That

*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you

suggested
Lola
,
``

*NL*
``
Indeed

Carrie
.
``
I
know
what
he
'd
say

I
do
n't
want
to

*NL*
*NL*
Lola
looked
at
her
with
big
,
merry
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
could
n't
hurt
you
,
''
she
returned
.
``
You
might
have
some
fun
with
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
awfully
queer
,
''
returned
the
little
,
blue-eyed
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
crowded
fortune
.
For
this
whole
week
,
though
her
large
salary
had
*NL*
not
yet
arrived
,
it
was
as
if
the
world
understood
and
trusted
her
.
*NL*
Without
money
--
or
the
requisite
sum
,
at
least
--
she
enjoyed
the
luxuries
*NL*
which
money
could
buy
.
For
her
the
doors
of
fine
places
seemed
to
open
*NL*
quite
without
the
asking
.
These
palatial
chambers
,
how
marvellously
they
*NL*
came
to
her
.
The
elegant
apartments
of
Mrs.
Vance
in
the
Chelsea
--
these
*NL*
were
hers
.
Men
sent
flowers
,
love
notes
,
offers
of
fortune
.
And
still
*NL*
her
dreams
ran
riot
.
The
one
hundred
and
fifty
!
the
one
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
!
What
a
door
to
an
Aladdin
's
cave
it
seemed
to
be
.
Each
day
,
her
*NL*
head
almost
turned
by
developments
,
her
fancies
of
what
her
fortune
must
*NL*
be
,
with
ample
money
,
grew
and
multiplied
.
She
conceived
of
delights
*NL*
which
were
not
--
saw
lights
of
joy
that
never
were
on
land
or
sea
.
Then
,
*NL*
at
last
,
after
a
world
of
anticipation
,
came
her
first
installment
of
*NL*
one
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
paid
to
her
in
greenbacks
--
three
twenties
,
six
tens
,
and
six
*NL*
fives
.
Thus
collected
it
made
a
very
convenient
roll
.
It
was
accompanied
*NL*
by
a
smile
and
a
salutation
from
the
cashier
who
paid
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
''
said
the
latter
,
when
she
applied
;
``
Miss
Madenda
--
one
hundred
*NL*
and
fifty
dollars
.
Quite
a
success
the
show
seems
to
have
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
''
returned
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Right
after
came
one
of
the
insignificant
members
of
the
company
,
and
*NL*
she
heard
the
changed
tone
of
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
said
the
same
cashier
,
sharply
.
One
,
such
as
she
had
only
*NL*
recently
been
,
was
waiting
for
her
modest
salary
.
It
took
her
back
to
*NL*
the
few
weeks
in
which
she
had
collected
--
or
rather
had
received
--
almost
*NL*
with
the
air
of
a
domestic
,
four-fifty
per
week
from
a
lordly
foreman
in
*NL*
a
shoe
factory
--
a
man
who
,
in
distributing
the
envelopes
,
had
the
manner
*NL*
of
a
prince
doling
out
favours
to
a
servile
group
of
petitioners
.
She
*NL*
knew
that
out
in
Chicago
this
very
day
the
same
factory
chamber
was
full
*NL*
of
poor
homely-clad
girls
working
in
long
lines
at
clattering
machines
;
*NL*
that
at
noon
they
would
eat
a
miserable
lunch
in
a
half-hour
;
that
*NL*
Saturday
they
would
gather
,
as
they
had
when
she
was
one
of
them
,
and
*NL*
accept
the
small
pay
for
work
a
hundred
times
harder
than
she
was
now
*NL*
doing
.
Oh
,
it
was
so
easy
now
!
The
world
was
so
rosy
and
bright
.
She
*NL*
felt
so
thrilled
that
she
must
needs
walk
back
to
the
hotel
to
think
,
*NL*
wondering
what
she
should
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
does
not
take
money
long
to
make
plain
its
impotence
,
providing
the
*NL*
desires
are
in
the
realm
of
affection
.
With
her
one
hundred
and
fifty
in
*NL*
hand
,
Carrie
could
think
of
nothing
particularly
to
do
.
In
itself
,
as
a
*NL*
tangible
,
apparent
thing
which
she
could
touch
and
look
upon
,
it
was
a
*NL*
diverting
thing
for
a
few
days
,
but
this
soon
passed
.
Her
hotel
bill
*NL*
did
not
require
its
use
.
Her
clothes
had
for
some
time
been
wholly
*NL*
satisfactory
.
Another
day
or
two
and
she
would
receive
another
hundred
*NL*
and
fifty
.
It
began
to
appear
as
if
this
were
not
so
startlingly
*NL*
necessary
to
maintain
her
present
state
.
If
she
wanted
to
do
anything
*NL*
better
or
move
higher
she
must
have
more
--
a
great
deal
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
a
critic
called
to
get
up
one
of
those
tinsel
interviews
which
shine
*NL*
with
clever
observations
,
show
up
the
wit
of
critics
,
display
the
folly
*NL*
of
celebrities
,
and
divert
the
public
.
He
liked
Carrie
,
and
said
so
,
*NL*
publicly
--
adding
,
however
,
that
she
was
merely
pretty
,
good-natured
,
and
*NL*
lucky
.
This
cut
like
a
knife
.
The
``
Herald
,
''
getting
up
an
entertainment
*NL*
for
the
benefit
of
its
free
ice
fund
,
did
her
the
honour
to
beg
her
to
*NL*
appear
along
with
celebrities
for
nothing
.
She
was
visited
by
a
young
*NL*
author
,
who
had
a
play
which
he
thought
she
could
produce
.
Alas
,
she
*NL*
could
not
judge
.
It
hurt
her
to
think
it
.
Then
she
found
she
must
put
*NL*
her
money
in
the
bank
for
safety
,
and
so
moving
,
finally
reached
the
*NL*
place
where
it
struck
her
that
the
door
to
life
's
perfect
enjoyment
was
*NL*
not
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
she
began
to
think
it
was
because
it
was
summer
.
Nothing
was
*NL*
going
on
much
save
such
entertainments
as
the
one
in
which
she
was
the
*NL*
star
.
Fifth
Avenue
was
boarded
up
where
the
rich
had
deserted
their
*NL*
mansions
.
Madison
Avenue
was
little
better
.
Broadway
was
full
of
loafing
*NL*
thespians
in
search
of
next
season
's
engagements
.
The
whole
city
was
*NL*
quiet
and
her
nights
were
taken
up
with
her
work
.
Hence
the
feeling
that
*NL*
there
was
little
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
to
Lola
one
day
,
sitting
at
one
of
the
windows
*NL*
which
looked
down
into
Broadway
,
``
I
get
lonely
;
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Lola
,
``
not
very
often
.
You
wo
n't
go
anywhere
.
That
's
what
's
*NL*
the
matter
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
can
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
're
lots
of
places
,
''
returned
Lola
,
who
was
thinking
of
her
*NL*
own
lightsome
tourneys
with
the
gay
youths
.
``
You
wo
n't
go
with
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
go
with
these
people
who
write
to
me
.
I
know
what
kind
*NL*
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
n't
to
be
lonely
,
''
said
Lola
,
thinking
of
Carrie
's
success
.
*NL*
``
There
're
lots
would
give
their
ears
to
be
in
your
shoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
out
again
at
the
passing
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unconsciously
her
idle
hands
were
beginning
to
weary

CURIOUS
SHIFTS
OF
THE
POOR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
gloomy
Hurstwood
,
sitting
in
his
cheap
hotel
,
where
he
had
taken
*NL*
refuge
with
seventy
dollars
--
the
price
of
his
furniture
--
between
him
and
*NL*
nothing
,
saw
a
hot
summer
out
and
a
cool
fall
in
,
reading
.
He
was
not
*NL*
wholly
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
his
money
was
slipping
away
.
As
*NL*
fifty
cents
after
fifty
cents
were
paid
out
for
a
day
's
lodging
he
*NL*
became
uneasy
,
and
finally
took
a
cheaper
room
--
thirty-five
cents
a
*NL*
day
--
to
make
his
money
last
longer
.
Frequently
he
saw
notices
of
Carrie
.
*NL*
Her
picture
was
in
the
``
World
''
once
or
twice
,
and
an
old
``
Herald
''
he
*NL*
found
in
a
chair
informed
him
that
she
had
recently
appeared
with
some
*NL*
others
at
a
benefit
for
something
or
other
.
He
read
these
things
with
*NL*
mingled
feelings
.
Each
one
seemed
to
put
her
farther
and
farther
away
*NL*
into
a
realm
which
became
more
imposing
as
it
receded
from
him
.
On
the
*NL*
billboards
,
too
,
he
saw
a
pretty
poster
,
showing
her
as
the
Quaker
Maid
,
*NL*
demure
and
dainty
.
More
than
once
he
stopped
and
looked
at
these
,
gazing
*NL*
at
the
pretty
face
in
a
sullen
sort
of
way
.
His
clothes
were
shabby
,
and
*NL*
he
presented
a
marked
contrast
to
all
that
she
now
seemed
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somehow
,
so
long
as
he
knew
she
was
at
the
Casino
,
though
he
had
never
*NL*
any
intention
of
going
near
her
,
there
was
a
subconscious
comfort
for
*NL*
him
--
he
was
not
quite
alone
.
The
show
seemed
such
a
fixture
that
,
*NL*
after
a
month
or
two
,
he
began
to
take
it
for
granted
that
it
was
still
*NL*
running
.
In
September
it
went
on
the
road
and
he
did
not
notice
it
.
When
*NL*
all
but
twenty
dollars
of
his
money
was
gone
,
he
moved
to
a
fifteen-cent
*NL*
lodging-house
in
the
Bowery
,
where
there
was
a
bare
lounging-room
filled
*NL*
with
tables
and
benches
as
well
as
some
chairs
.
Here
his
preference
was
*NL*
to
close
his
eyes
and
dream
of
other
days
,
a
habit
which
grew
upon
him
.
*NL*
It
was
not
sleep
at
first
,
but
a
mental
hearkening
back
to
scenes
and
*NL*
incidents
in
his
Chicago
life
.
As
the
present
became
darker
,
the
past
*NL*
grew
brighter
,
and
all
that
concerned
it
stood
in
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
unconscious
of
just
how
much
this
habit
had
hold
of
him
until
one
*NL*
day
he
found
his
lips
repeating
an
old
answer
he
had
made
to
one
of
his
*NL*
friends
.
They
were
in
Fitzgerald
and
Moy
's
.
It
was
as
if
he
stood
in
the
*NL*
door
of
his
elegant
little
office
,
comfortably
dressed
,
talking
to
*NL*
Sagar
Morrison
about
the
value
of
South
Chicago
real
estate
in
which
the
*NL*
latter
was
about
to
invest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
would
you
like
to
come
in
on
that
with
me
?
''
he
heard
Morrison
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
me
,
''
he
answered
,
just
as
he
had
years
before
.
``
I
have
my
hands
*NL*
full
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
movement
of
his
lips
aroused
him
.
He
wondered
whether
he
had
really
*NL*
spoken
.
The
next
time
he
noticed
anything
of
the
sort
he
really
did
*NL*
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
jump
,
you
bloody
fool
?
''
he
was
saying
.
``
Jump
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
funny
English
story
he
was
telling
to
a
company
of
actors
.
Even
*NL*
as
his
voice
recalled
him
,
he
was
smiling
.
A
crusty
old
codger
,
sitting
*NL*
near
by
,
seemed
disturbed
;
at
least
,
he
stared
in
a
most
pointed
way
.
*NL*
Hurstwood
straightened
up
.
The
humour
of
the
memory
fled
in
an
instant
*NL*
and
he
felt
ashamed
.
For
relief
,
he
left
his
chair
and
strolled
out
into
*NL*
the
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
looking
down
the
ad
.
columns
of
the
``
Evening
World
,
''
he
saw
*NL*
where
a
new
play
was
at
the
Casino
.
Instantly
,
he
came
to
a
mental
halt
.
*NL*
Carrie
had
gone
!
He
remembered
seeing
a
poster
of
her
only
yesterday
,
*NL*
but
no
doubt
it
was
one
left
uncovered
by
the
new
signs
.
Curiously
,
this
*NL*
fact
shook
him
up
.
He
had
almost
to
admit
that
somehow
he
was
depending
*NL*
upon
her
being
in
the
city
.
Now
she
was
gone
.
He
wondered
how
this
*NL*
important
fact
had
skipped
him
.
Goodness
knows
when
she
would
be
back
*NL*
now
.
Impelled
by
a
nervous
fear
,
he
rose
and
went
into
the
dingy
hall
,
*NL*
where
he
counted
his
remaining
money
,
unseen
.
There
were
but
ten
dollars
*NL*
in
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
how
all
these
other
lodging-house
people
around
him
*NL*
got
along
.
They
did
n't
seem
to
do
anything
.
Perhaps
they
*NL*
begged
--
unquestionably
they
did
.
Many
was
the
dime
he
had
given
to
*NL*
such
as
they
in
his
day
.
He
had
seen
other
men
asking
for
money
on
the
*NL*
streets
.
Maybe
he
could
get
some
that
way
.
There
was
horror
in
this
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
in
the
lodging-house
room
,
he
came
to
his
last
fifty
cents
.
He
*NL*
had
saved
and
counted
until
his
health
was
affected
.
His
stoutness
*NL*
had
gone
.
With
it
,
even
the
semblance
of
a
fit
in
his
clothes
.
Now
he
*NL*
decided
he
must
do
something
,
and
,
walking
about
,
saw
another
day
go
by
,
*NL*
bringing
him
down
to
his
last
twenty
cents
--
not
enough
to
eat
for
the
*NL*
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Summoning
all
his
courage
,
he
crossed
to
Broadway
and
up
to
the
Broadway
*NL*
Central
hotel
.
Within
a
block
he
halted
,
undecided
.
A
big
,
heavy-faced
*NL*
porter
was
standing
at
one
of
the
side
entrances
,
looking
out
.
Hurstwood
*NL*
purposed
to
appeal
to
him
.
Walking
straight
up
,
he
was
upon
him
before
*NL*
he
could
turn
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
he
said
,
recognising
even
in
his
plight
the
man
's
*NL*
inferiority
,
``
is
there
anything
about
this
hotel
that
I
could
get
to
*NL*
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
stared
at
him
the
while
he
continued
to
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
out
of
work
and
out
of
money
and
I
've
got
to
get
something
,
--
it
*NL*
does
n't
matter
what
.
I
do
n't
care
to
talk
about
what
I
've
been
,
but
if
*NL*
you
'd
tell
me
how
to
get
something
to
do
,
I
'd
be
much
obliged
to
you
.
It
*NL*
would
n't
matter
if
it
only
lasted
a
few
days
just
now
.
I
've
got
to
have
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
still
gazed
,
trying
to
look
indifferent
.
Then
,
seeing
that
*NL*
Hurstwood
was
about
to
go
on
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
You
'll
have
to
ask
inside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Curiously
,
this
stirred
Hurstwood
to
further
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
might
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellow
shook
his
head
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
Inside
went
the
ex-manager
and
straight
to
an
office
off
the
clerk
's
*NL*
desk
.
One
of
the
managers
of
the
hotel
happened
to
be
there
.
Hurstwood
*NL*
looked
him
straight
in
the
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
give
me
something
to
do
for
a
few
days
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
in
a
*NL*
position
where
I
have
to
get
something
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
comfortable
manager
looked
at
him
,
as
much
as
to
say
:
``
Well
,
I
*NL*
should
judge
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
here
,
''
explained
Hurstwood
,
nervously
,
``
because
I
've
been
a
*NL*
manager
myself
in
my
day
.
I
've
had
bad
luck
in
a
way
but
I
'm
not
here
to
*NL*
tell
you
that
.
I
want
something
to
do
,
if
only
for
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
imagined
he
saw
a
feverish
gleam
in
the
applicant
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
hotel
did
you
manage
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
a
hotel
,
''
said
Hurstwood
.
``
I
was
manager
of
Fitzgerald
and
*NL*
Moy
's
place
in
Chicago
for
fifteen
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
''
said
the
hotel
man
.
``
How
did
you
come
to
get
out
of
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
figure
of
Hurstwood
was
rather
surprising
in
contrast
to
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
by
foolishness
of
my
own
.
It
is
n't
anything
to
talk
about
now
.
*NL*
You
could
find
out
if
you
wanted
to
.
I
'm
`
broke
'
now
and
,
if
you
will
*NL*
believe
me
,
I
have
n't
eaten
anything
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hotel
man
was
slightly
interested
in
this
story
.
He
could
hardly
*NL*
tell
what
to
do
with
such
a
figure
,
and
yet
Hurstwood
's
earnestness
made
*NL*
him
wish
to
do
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
Olsen
,
''
he
said
,
turning
to
the
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reply
to
a
bell
and
a
disappearing
hall-boy
,
Olsen
,
the
head
porter
,
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Olsen
,
''
said
the
manager
,
``
is
there
anything
downstairs
you
could
find
*NL*
for
this
man
to
do
?
I
'd
like
to
give
him
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
''
said
Olsen
.
``
We
have
about
all
the
help
we
need
.
I
*NL*
think
I
could
find
something
,
sir
,
though
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
.
Take
him
to
the
kitchen
and
tell
Wilson
to
give
him
something
to
*NL*
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
sir
,
''
said
Olsen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
followed
.
Out
of
the
manager
's
sight
,
the
head
porter
's
manner
*NL*
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
the
devil
there
is
to
do
,
''
he
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
said
nothing
.
To
him
the
big
trunk
hustler
was
a
subject
for
*NL*
private
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
to
give
this
man
something
to
eat
,
''
he
observed
to
the
cook
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
looked
Hurstwood
over
,
and
seeing
something
keen
and
*NL*
intellectual
in
his
eyes
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sit
down
over
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
was
Hurstwood
installed
in
the
Broadway
Central
,
but
not
for
long
.
*NL*
He
was
in
no
shape
or
mood
to
do
the
scrub
work
that
exists
about
the
*NL*
foundation
of
every
hotel
.
Nothing
better
offering
,
he
was
set
to
aid
*NL*
the
fireman
,
to
work
about
the
basement
,
to
do
anything
and
everything
*NL*
that
might
offer
.
Porters
,
cooks
,
firemen
,
clerks
--
all
were
over
him
.
*NL*
Moreover
his
appearance
did
not
please
these
individuals
--
his
temper
was
*NL*
too
lonely
--
and
they
made
it
disagreeable
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
stolidity
and
indifference
of
despair
,
however
,
he
endured
it
*NL*
all
,
sleeping
in
an
attic
at
the
roof
of
the
house
,
eating
what
the
cook
*NL*
gave
him
,
accepting
a
few
dollars
a
week
,
which
he
tried
to
save
.
His
*NL*
constitution
was
in
no
shape
to
endure
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
the
following
February
he
was
sent
on
an
errand
to
a
large
coal
*NL*
company
's
office
.
It
had
been
snowing
and
thawing
and
the
streets
were
*NL*
sloppy
.
He
soaked
his
shoes
in
his
progress
and
came
back
feeling
dull
*NL*
and
weary
.
All
the
next
day
he
felt
unusually
depressed
and
sat
about
*NL*
as
much
as
possible
,
to
the
irritation
of
those
who
admired
energy
in
*NL*
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
some
boxes
were
to
be
moved
to
make
room
for
new
*NL*
culinary
supplies
.
He
was
ordered
to
handle
a
truck
.
Encountering
a
big
*NL*
box
,
he
could
not
lift
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
there
?
''
said
the
head
porter
.
``
Ca
n't
you
handle
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
straining
to
lift
it
,
but
now
he
quit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
,
weakly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
looked
at
him
and
saw
that
he
was
deathly
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
sick
,
are
you
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
think
I
am
,
''
returned
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'd
better
go
sit
down
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
he
did
,
but
soon
grew
rapidly
worse
.
It
seemed
all
he
could
do
to
*NL*
crawl
to
his
room
,
where
he
remained
for
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
Wheeler
's
sick
,
''
reported
one
of
the
lackeys
to
the
night
*NL*
clerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
He
's
got
a
high
fever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hotel
physician
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
send
him
to
Bellevue
,
''
he
recommended
.
``
He
's
got
pneumonia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
he
was
carted
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
three
weeks
the
worst
was
over
,
but
it
was
nearly
the
first
of
*NL*
May
before
his
strength
permitted
him
to
be
turned
out
.
Then
he
was
*NL*
discharged
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
more
weakly
looking
object
ever
strolled
out
into
the
spring
sunshine
*NL*
than
the
once
hale
,
lusty
manager
.
All
his
corpulency
had
fled
.
His
face
*NL*
was
thin
and
pale
,
his
hands
white
,
his
body
flabby
.
Clothes
and
all
,
*NL*
he
weighed
but
one
hundred
and
thirty-five
pounds
.
Some
old
garments
*NL*
had
been
given
him
--
a
cheap
brown
coat
and
misfit
pair
of
trousers
.
Also
*NL*
some
change
and
advice
.
He
was
told
to
apply
to
the
charities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
resorted
to
the
Bowery
lodging-house
,
brooding
over
where
to
*NL*
look
.
From
this
it
was
but
a
step
to
beggary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
a
man
do
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
ca
n't
starve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
application
was
in
sunny
Second
Avenue
.
A
well-dressed
man
*NL*
came
leisurely
strolling
toward
him
out
of
Stuyvesant
Park
.
Hurstwood
*NL*
nerved
himself
and
sidled
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
mind
giving
me
ten
cents
?
''
he
said
,
directly
.
``
I
'm
in
a
*NL*
position
where
I
must
ask
some
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
scarcely
looked
at
him
,
fished
in
his
vest
pocket
and
took
out
a
*NL*
dime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
are
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
obliged
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
softly
,
but
the
other
paid
no
more
*NL*
attention
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Satisfied
with
his
success
and
yet
ashamed
of
his
situation
,
he
decided
*NL*
that
he
would
only
ask
for
twenty-five
cents
more
,
since
that
would
be
*NL*
sufficient
.
He
strolled
about
sizing
up
people
,
but
it
was
long
before
*NL*
just
the
right
face
and
situation
arrived
.
When
he
asked
,
he
was
*NL*
refused
.
Shocked
by
this
result
,
he
took
an
hour
to
recover
and
then
*NL*
asked
again
.
This
time
a
nickel
was
given
him
.
By
the
most
watchful
*NL*
effort
he
did
get
twenty
cents
more
,
but
it
was
painful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
he
resorted
to
the
same
effort
,
experiencing
a
variety
of
*NL*
rebuffs
and
one
or
two
generous
receptions
.
At
last
it
crossed
his
mind
*NL*
that
there
was
a
science
of
faces
,
and
that
a
man
could
pick
the
liberal
*NL*
countenance
if
he
tried
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
pleasure
to
him
,
however
,
this
stopping
of
passers-by
.
He
saw
*NL*
one
man
taken
up
for
it
and
now
troubled
lest
he
should
be
arrested
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
went
on
,
vaguely
anticipating
that
indefinite
something
*NL*
which
is
always
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
a
sense
of
satisfaction
,
then
,
that
he
saw
announced
one
*NL*
morning
the
return
of
the
Casino
Company
,
``
with
Miss
Carrie
Madenda
.
''
*NL*
He
had
thought
of
her
often
enough
in
days
past
.
How
successful
she
*NL*
was
--
how
much
money
she
must
have
!
Even
now
,
however
,
it
took
a
severe
*NL*
run
of
ill
luck
to
decide
him
to
appeal
to
her
.
He
was
truly
hungry
*NL*
before
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
ask
her
.
She
wo
n't
refuse
me
a
few
dollars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
he
headed
for
the
Casino
one
afternoon
,
passing
it
several
*NL*
times
in
an
effort
to
locate
the
stage
entrance
.
Then
he
sat
in
Bryant
*NL*
Park
,
a
block
away
,
waiting
.
``
She
ca
n't
refuse
to
help
me
a
little
,
''
he
*NL*
kept
saying
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beginning
with
half-past
six
,
he
hovered
like
a
shadow
about
the
*NL*
Thirty-ninth
Street
entrance
,
pretending
always
to
be
a
hurrying
*NL*
pedestrian
and
yet
fearful
lest
he
should
miss
his
object
.
He
was
*NL*
slightly
nervous
,
too
,
now
that
the
eventful
hour
had
arrived
;
but
being
*NL*
weak
and
hungry
,
his
ability
to
suffer
was
modified
.
At
last
he
saw
that
*NL*
the
actors
were
beginning
to
arrive
,
and
his
nervous
tension
increased
,
*NL*
until
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
not
stand
much
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
thought
he
saw
Carrie
coming
and
moved
forward
,
only
to
see
that
*NL*
he
was
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ca
n't
be
long
,
now
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
half
fearing
to
encounter
*NL*
her
and
equally
depressed
at
the
thought
that
she
might
have
gone
in
by
*NL*
another
way
.
His
stomach
was
so
empty
that
it
ached
.
*NL*
*NL*
Individual
after
individual
passed
him
,
nearly
all
well
dressed
,
almost
*NL*
all
indifferent
.
He
saw
coaches
rolling
by
,
gentlemen
passing
with
*NL*
ladies
--
the
evening
's
merriment
was
beginning
in
this
region
of
theatres
*NL*
and
hotels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
coach
rolled
up
and
the
driver
jumped
down
to
open
the
door
.
*NL*
Before
Hurstwood
could
act
,
two
ladies
flounced
across
the
broad
walk
*NL*
and
disappeared
in
the
stage
door
.
He
thought
he
saw
Carrie
,
but
it
was
*NL*
so
unexpected
,
so
elegant
and
far
away
,
he
could
hardly
tell
.
He
waited
*NL*
a
while
longer
,
growing
feverish
with
want
,
and
then
seeing
that
the
*NL*
stage
door
no
longer
opened
,
and
that
a
merry
audience
was
arriving
,
he
*NL*
concluded
it
must
have
been
Carrie
and
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
''
he
said
,
hastening
out
of
the
street
into
which
the
more
*NL*
fortunate
were
pouring
,
``
I
've
got
to
get
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
hour
,
when
Broadway
is
wont
to
assume
its
most
interesting
*NL*
aspect
,
a
peculiar
individual
invariably
took
his
stand
at
the
corner
*NL*
of
Twenty-sixth
Street
and
Broadway
--
a
spot
which
is
also
intersected
by
*NL*
Fifth
Avenue
.
This
was
the
hour
when
the
theatres
were
just
beginning
*NL*
to
receive
their
patrons
.
Fire
signs
announcing
the
night
's
amusements
*NL*
blazed
on
every
hand
.
Cabs
and
carriages
,
their
lamps
gleaming
like
*NL*
yellow
eyes
,
pattered
by
.
Couples
and
parties
of
three
and
four
freely
*NL*
mingled
in
the
common
crowd
,
which
poured
by
in
a
thick
stream
,
laughing
*NL*
and
jesting
.
On
Fifth
Avenue
were
loungers
--
a
few
wealthy
strollers
,
*NL*
a
gentleman
in
evening
dress
with
his
lady
on
his
arm
,
some
club-men
*NL*
passing
from
one
smoking-room
to
another
.
Across
the
way
the
great
*NL*
hotels
showed
a
hundred
gleaming
windows
,
their
cafes
and
billiard-rooms
*NL*
filled
with
a
comfortable
,
well-dressed
,
and
pleasure-loving
throng
.
*NL*
All
about
was
the
night
,
pulsating
with
the
thoughts
of
pleasure
and
*NL*
exhilaration
--
the
curious
enthusiasm
of
a
great
city
bent
upon
finding
*NL*
joy
in
a
thousand
different
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unique
individual
was
no
less
than
an
ex-soldier
turned
*NL*
religionist
,
who
,
having
suffered
the
whips
and
privations
of
our
*NL*
peculiar
social
system
,
had
concluded
that
his
duty
to
the
God
which
he
*NL*
conceived
lay
in
aiding
his
fellow-man
.
The
form
of
aid
which
he
chose
*NL*
to
administer
was
entirely
original
with
himself
.
It
consisted
of
*NL*
securing
a
bed
for
all
such
homeless
wayfarers
as
should
apply
to
him
at
*NL*
this
particular
spot
,
though
he
had
scarcely
the
wherewithal
to
provide
*NL*
a
comfortable
habitation
for
himself
.
Taking
his
place
amid
this
*NL*
lightsome
atmosphere
,
he
would
stand
,
his
stocky
figure
cloaked
in
a
*NL*
great
cape
overcoat
,
his
head
protected
by
a
broad
slouch
hat
,
awaiting
*NL*
the
applicants
who
had
in
various
ways
learned
the
nature
of
his
*NL*
charity
.
For
a
while
he
would
stand
alone
,
gazing
like
any
idler
upon
an
*NL*
ever-fascinating
scene
.
On
the
evening
in
question
,
a
policeman
*NL*
passing
saluted
him
as
``
captain
,
''
in
a
friendly
way
.
An
urchin
who
had
*NL*
frequently
seen
him
before
,
stopped
to
gaze
.
All
others
took
him
for
*NL*
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
,
save
in
the
matter
of
dress
,
and
conceived
*NL*
of
him
as
a
stranger
whistling
and
idling
for
his
own
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
first
half-hour
waned
,
certain
characters
appeared
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
in
the
passing
crowds
one
might
see
,
now
and
then
,
a
loiterer
*NL*
edging
interestedly
near
.
A
slouchy
figure
crossed
the
opposite
corner
*NL*
and
glanced
furtively
in
his
direction
.
Another
came
down
Fifth
Avenue
*NL*
to
the
corner
of
Twenty-sixth
Street
,
took
a
general
survey
,
and
hobbled
*NL*
off
again
.
Two
or
three
noticeable
Bowery
types
edged
along
the
Fifth
*NL*
Avenue
side
of
Madison
Square
,
but
did
not
venture
over
.
The
soldier
,
in
*NL*
his
cape
overcoat
,
walked
a
short
line
of
ten
feet
at
his
corner
,
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
indifferently
whistling
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
nine
o'clock
approached
,
some
of
the
hubbub
of
the
earlier
hour
*NL*
passed
.
The
atmosphere
of
the
hotels
was
not
so
youthful
.
The
air
,
too
,
*NL*
was
colder
.
On
every
hand
curious
figures
were
moving
--
watchers
and
*NL*
peepers
,
without
an
imaginary
circle
,
which
they
seemed
afraid
to
*NL*
enter
--
a
dozen
in
all
.
Presently
,
with
the
arrival
of
a
keener
sense
of
*NL*
cold
,
one
figure
came
forward
.
It
crossed
Broadway
from
out
the
shadow
*NL*
of
Twenty-sixth
Street
,
and
,
in
a
halting
,
circuitous
way
,
arrived
close
*NL*
to
the
waiting
figure
.
There
was
something
shamefaced
or
diffident
about
*NL*
the
movement
,
as
if
the
intention
were
to
conceal
any
idea
of
stopping
*NL*
until
the
very
last
moment
.
Then
suddenly
,
close
to
the
soldier
,
came
*NL*
the
halt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
looked
in
recognition
,
but
there
was
no
especial
greeting
.
*NL*
The
newcomer
nodded
slightly
and
murmured
something
like
one
who
waits
*NL*
for
gifts
.
The
other
simply
motioned
to-ward
the
edge
of
the
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
over
there
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
the
spell
was
broken
.
Even
while
the
soldier
resumed
his
short
,
*NL*
solemn
walk
,
other
figures
shuffled
forward
.
They
did
not
so
much
*NL*
as
greet
the
leader
,
but
joined
the
one
,
sniffling
and
hitching
and
*NL*
scraping
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gold
,
ai
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
winter
's
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Looks
as
though
it
might
rain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
motley
company
had
increased
to
ten
.
One
or
two
knew
each
other
and
*NL*
conversed
.
Others
stood
off
a
few
feet
,
not
wishing
to
be
in
the
crowd
*NL*
and
yet
not
counted
out
.
They
were
peevish
,
crusty
,
silent
,
eying
*NL*
nothing
in
particular
and
moving
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
would
have
been
talking
soon
,
but
the
soldier
gave
them
no
chance
.
*NL*
Counting
sufficient
to
begin
,
he
came
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beds
,
eh
,
all
of
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
general
shuffle
and
murmur
of
approval
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
line
up
here
.
I
'll
see
what
I
can
do
.
I
have
n't
a
cent
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
fell
into
a
sort
of
broken
,
ragged
line
.
One
might
see
,
now
,
some
*NL*
of
the
chief
characteristics
by
contrast
.
There
was
a
wooden
leg
in
*NL*
the
line
.
Hats
were
all
drooping
,
a
group
that
would
ill
become
a
*NL*
second-hand
Hester
Street
basement
collection
.
Trousers
were
all
warped
*NL*
and
frayed
at
the
bottom
and
coats
worn
and
faded
.
In
the
glare
of
the
*NL*
store
lights
,
some
of
the
faces
looked
dry
and
chalky
;
others
were
red
*NL*
with
blotches
and
puffed
in
the
cheeks
and
under
the
eyes
;
one
or
two
*NL*
were
rawboned
and
reminded
one
of
railroad
hands
.
A
few
spectators
came
*NL*
near
,
drawn
by
the
seemingly
conferring
group
,
then
more
and
more
,
and
*NL*
quickly
there
was
a
pushing
,
gaping
crowd
.
Some
one
in
the
line
began
to
*NL*
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
exclaimed
the
captain
.
``
Now
,
then
,
gentlemen
,
these
men
are
*NL*
without
beds
.
They
have
to
have
some
place
to
sleep
to-night
.
They
ca
n't
*NL*
lie
out
in
the
streets
.
I
need
twelve
cents
to
put
one
of
them
to
bed
.
*NL*
Who
will
give
it
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
'll
have
to
wait
here
,
boys
,
until
some
one
does
.
Twelve
cents
*NL*
is
n't
so
very
much
for
one
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
fifteen
,
''
exclaimed
a
young
man
,
peering
forward
with
strained
*NL*
eyes
.
``
It
's
all
I
can
afford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
Now
I
have
fifteen
.
Step
out
of
the
line
,
''
and
seizing
one
*NL*
by
the
shoulder
,
the
captain
marched
him
off
a
little
way
and
stood
him
*NL*
up
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
back
,
he
resumed
his
place
and
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
three
cents
left
.
These
men
must
be
put
to
bed
somehow
.
There
*NL*
are
''
--
counting
--
``
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
,
six
,
seven
,
eight
,
nine
,
*NL*
ten
,
eleven
,
twelve
men
.
Nine
cents
more
will
put
the
next
man
to
bed
;
*NL*
give
him
a
good
,
comfortable
bed
for
the
night
.
I
go
right
along
and
*NL*
look
after
that
myself
.
Who
will
give
me
nine
cents
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
watchers
,
this
time
a
middle-aged
man
,
handed
him
a
five-cent
*NL*
piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
have
eight
cents
.
Four
more
will
give
this
man
a
bed
.
Come
,
*NL*
gentlemen
.
We
are
going
very
slow
this
evening
.
You
all
have
good
beds
.
*NL*
How
about
these
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
''
remarked
a
bystander
,
putting
a
coin
into
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
said
the
captain
,
looking
at
the
coin
,
``
pays
for
two
beds
for
*NL*
two
men
and
gives
me
five
on
the
next
one
.
Who
will
give
me
seven
cents
*NL*
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
down
Sixth
Avenue
this
evening
,
Hurstwood
chanced
to
cross
*NL*
east
through
Twenty-sixth
Street
toward
Third
Avenue
.
He
was
wholly
*NL*
disconsolate
in
spirit
,
hungry
to
what
he
deemed
an
almost
mortal
*NL*
extent
,
weary
,
and
defeated
.
How
should
he
get
at
Carrie
now
?
It
would
*NL*
be
eleven
before
the
show
was
over
.
If
she
came
in
a
coach
,
she
would
go
*NL*
away
in
one
.
He
would
need
to
interrupt
under
most
trying
circumstances
.
*NL*
Worst
of
all
,
he
was
hungry
and
weary
,
and
at
best
a
whole
day
must
*NL*
intervene
,
for
he
had
not
heart
to
try
again
to-night
.
He
had
no
food
*NL*
and
no
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
neared
Broadway
,
he
noticed
the
captain
's
gathering
of
*NL*
wanderers
,
but
thinking
it
to
be
the
result
of
a
street
preacher
or
some
*NL*
patent
medicine
fakir
,
was
about
to
pass
on
.
However
,
in
crossing
the
*NL*
street
toward
Madison
Square
Park
,
he
noticed
the
line
of
men
whose
beds
*NL*
were
already
secured
,
stretching
out
from
the
main
body
of
the
crowd
.
In
*NL*
the
glare
of
the
neighbouring
electric
light
he
recognised
a
type
of
*NL*
his
own
kind
--
the
figures
whom
he
saw
about
the
streets
and
in
the
*NL*
lodging-houses
,
drifting
in
mind
and
body
like
himself
.
He
wondered
what
*NL*
it
could
be
and
turned
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
captain
curtly
pleading
as
before
.
He
heard
with
*NL*
astonishment
and
a
sense
of
relief
the
oft-repeated
words
:
``
These
men
*NL*
must
have
a
bed
.
''
Before
him
was
the
line
of
unfortunates
whose
beds
*NL*
were
yet
to
be
had
,
and
seeing
a
newcomer
quietly
edge
up
and
take
a
*NL*
position
at
the
end
of
the
line
,
he
decided
to
do
likewise
.
What
use
*NL*
to
contend
?
He
was
weary
to-night
.
It
was
a
simple
way
out
of
one
*NL*
difficulty
,
at
least
.
To-morrow
,
maybe
,
he
would
do
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
Back
of
him
,
where
some
of
those
were
whose
beds
were
safe
,
a
relaxed
*NL*
air
was
apparent
.
The
strain
of
uncertainty
being
removed
,
he
heard
*NL*
them
talking
with
moderate
freedom
and
some
leaning
toward
sociability
.
*NL*
Politics
,
religion
,
the
state
of
the
government
,
some
newspaper
*NL*
sensations
,
and
the
more
notorious
facts
the
world
over
,
found
*NL*
mouthpieces
and
auditors
there
.
Cracked
and
husky
voices
pronounced
*NL*
forcibly
upon
odd
matters
.
Vague
and
rambling
observations
were
made
in
*NL*
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
squints
,
and
leers
,
and
some
dull
,
ox-like
stares
from
those
*NL*
who
were
too
dull
or
too
weary
to
converse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Standing
tells
.
Hurstwood
became
more
weary
waiting
.
He
thought
he
*NL*
should
drop
soon
and
shifted
restlessly
from
one
foot
to
the
other
.
*NL*
At
last
his
turn
came
.
The
man
ahead
had
been
paid
for
and
gone
to
the
*NL*
blessed
line
of
success
.
He
was
now
first
,
and
already
the
captain
was
*NL*
talking
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twelve
cents
,
gentlemen
--
twelve
cents
puts
this
man
to
bed
.
He
would
n't
*NL*
stand
here
in
the
cold
if
he
had
any
place
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
swallowed
something
that
rose
to
his
throat
.
Hunger
and
*NL*
weakness
had
made
a
coward
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
''
said
a
stranger
,
handing
money
to
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
latter
put
a
kindly
hand
on
the
ex-manager
's
shoulder
.
``
Line
up
*NL*
over
there
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
there
,
Hurstwood
breathed
easier
.
He
felt
as
if
the
world
were
*NL*
not
quite
so
bad
with
such
a
good
man
in
it
.
Others
seemed
to
feel
like
*NL*
himself
about
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
's
a
great
feller
,
ai
n't
he
?
''
said
the
man
ahead
--
a
little
,
*NL*
woebegone
,
helpless-looking
sort
of
individual
,
who
looked
as
though
he
*NL*
had
ever
been
the
sport
and
care
of
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
!
there
's
a
lot
back
there
yet
,
''
said
a
man
farther
up
,
leaning
out
*NL*
and
looking
back
at
the
applicants
for
whom
the
captain
was
pleading
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Must
be
over
a
hundred
to-night
,
''
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
the
guy
in
the
cab
,
''
observed
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cab
had
stopped
.
Some
gentleman
in
evening
dress
reached
out
a
bill
to
*NL*
the
captain
,
who
took
it
with
simple
thanks
and
turned
away
to
his
line
.
*NL*
There
was
a
general
craning
of
necks
as
the
jewel
in
the
white
shirt
*NL*
front
sparkled
and
the
cab
moved
off
.
Even
the
crowd
gaped
in
awe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
fixes
up
nine
men
for
the
night
,
''
said
the
captain
,
counting
out
*NL*
as
many
of
the
line
near
him
.
``
Line
up
over
there
.
Now
,
then
,
there
are
*NL*
only
seven
.
I
need
twelve
cents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Money
came
slowly
.
In
the
course
of
time
the
crowd
thinned
out
to
*NL*
a
meagre
handful
.
Fifth
Avenue
,
save
for
an
occasional
cab
or
foot
*NL*
passenger
,
was
bare
.
Broadway
was
thinly
peopled
with
pedestrians
.
Only
*NL*
now
and
then
a
stranger
passing
noticed
the
small
group
,
handed
out
a
*NL*
coin
,
and
went
away
,
unheeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
remained
stolid
and
determined
.
He
talked
on
,
very
slowly
,
*NL*
uttering
the
fewest
words
and
with
a
certain
assurance
,
as
though
he
*NL*
could
not
fail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
;
I
ca
n't
stay
out
here
all
night
.
These
men
are
getting
tired
and
*NL*
cold
.
Some
one
give
me
four
cents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
time
when
he
said
nothing
at
all
.
Money
was
handed
him
,
*NL*
and
for
each
twelve
cents
he
singled
out
a
man
and
put
him
in
the
other
*NL*
line
.
Then
he
walked
up
and
down
as
before
,
looking
at
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
theatres
let
out
.
Fire
signs
disappeared
.
A
clock
struck
eleven
.
*NL*
Another
half-hour
and
he
was
down
to
the
last
two
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
,
''
he
exclaimed
to
several
curious
observers

``
eighteen

us

up

give
me
the
money

Remember
,
I
have
to
go
over
to

yet
to-night

Before

I

down
and
put
them
to

Eighteen

''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
responded
.
He
walked
to
and
fro
,
looking
down
for
several
*NL*
minutes
,
occasionally
saying
softly
:
``
Eighteen
cents
.
''
It
seemed
as
if
*NL*
this
paltry
sum
would
delay
the
desired
culmination
longer
than
all
the
*NL*
rest
had
.
Hurstwood
,
buoyed
up
slightly
by
the
long
line
of
which
he
was
*NL*
a
part
,
refrained
with
an
effort
from
groaning
,
he
was
so
weak
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
a
lady
in
opera
cape
and
rustling
skirts
came
down
Fifth
Avenue
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
her
escort
.
Hurstwood
gazed
wearily
,
reminded
by
her
both
*NL*
of
Carrie
in
her
new
world
and
of
the
time
when
he
had
escorted
his
own
*NL*
wife
in
like
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
gazing
,
she
turned
and
,
looking
at
the
remarkable
company
,
*NL*
sent
her
escort
over
.
He
came
,
holding
a
bill
in
his
fingers
,
all
*NL*
elegant
and
graceful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
''
said
the
captain
,
turning
to
the
two
remaining
applicants
.
*NL*
``
Now
we
have
some
for
to-morrow
night
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therewith
he
lined
up
the
last
two
and
proceeded
to
the
head
,
counting
*NL*
as
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
hundred
and
thirty-seven
,
''
he
announced
.
``
Now
,
boys
,
line
up
.
Right
*NL*
dress
there
.
We
wo
n't
be
much
longer
about
this
.
Steady
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
placed
himself
at
the
head
and
called
out
``
Forward
.
''
Hurstwood
*NL*
moved
with
the
line
.
Across
Fifth
Avenue
,
through
Madison
Square
by
the
*NL*
winding
paths
,
east
on
Twenty-third
Street
,
and
down
Third
Avenue
wound
*NL*
the
long
,
serpentine
company
.
Midnight
pedestrians
and
loiterers
*NL*
stopped
and
stared
as
the
company
passed
.
Chatting
policemen
,
at
various
*NL*
corners
,
stared
indifferently
or
nodded
to
the
leader
,
whom
they
had
*NL*
seen
before
.
On
Third
Avenue
they
marched
,
a
seemingly
weary
way
,
to
*NL*
Eighth
Street
,
where
there
was
a
lodginghouse
,
closed
,
apparently
,
for
*NL*
the
night
.
They
were
expected
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
in
the
gloom
they
stood
,
while
the
leader
parleyed
within
.
Then
*NL*
doors
swung
open
and
they
were
invited
in
with
a
``
Steady
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
was
at
the
head
showing
rooms
,
so
that
there
was
no
delay
for
*NL*
keys
.
Toiling
up
the
creaky
stairs
,
Hurstwood
looked
back
and
saw
the
*NL*
captain
,
watching
;
the
last
one
of
the
line
being
included
in
his
broad
*NL*
solicitude
.
Then
he
gathered
his
cloak
about
him
and
strolled
out
into
*NL*
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stand
much
of
this
,
''
said
Hurstwood
,
whose
legs
ached
him
*NL*
painfully
,
as
he
sat
down
upon
the
miserable
bunk
in
the
small
,
*NL*
lightless
chamber
allotted
to
him
.
``
I
've
got
to
eat
,
or
I
'll
die

STIRRING
TROUBLED
WATERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Playing
in
New
York
one
evening
on
this
her
return
,
Carrie
was
putting
*NL*
the
finishing
touches
to
her
toilet
before
leaving
for
the
night
,
when
*NL*
a
commotion
near
the
stage
door
caught
her
ear
.
It
included
a
familiar
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
now
.
I
want
to
see
Miss
Madenda
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
send
in
your
card
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
off
!
Here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
half-dollar
was
passed
over
,
and
now
a
knock
came
at
her
dressing-room
*NL*
door
.
Carrie
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
!
''
said
Drouet
.
``
I
do
swear
!
Why
,
how
are
you
?
I
knew
that
*NL*
was
you
the
moment
I
saw
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
fell
back
a
pace
,
expecting
a
most
embarrassing
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
going
to
shake
hands
with
me
?
Well
,
you
're
a
dandy
!
That
's
*NL*
all
right
,
shake
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
put
out
her
hand
,
smiling
,
if
for
nothing
more
than
the
man
's
*NL*
exuberant
good-nature
.
Though
older
,
he
was
but
slightly
changed
.
The
*NL*
same
fine
clothes
,
the
same
stocky
body
,
the
same
rosy
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
fellow
at
the
door
there
did
n't
want
to
let
me
in
,
until
I
paid
*NL*
him
.
I
knew
it
was
you
,
all
right
.
Say
,
you
've
got
a
great
show
.
You
do
*NL*
your
part
fine
.
I
knew
you
would
.
I
just
happened
to
be
passing
to
*NL*
night
and
thought
I
'd
drop
in
for
a
few
minutes
.
I
saw
your
name
on
the
*NL*
programme
,
but
I
did
n't
remember
it
until
you
came
on
the
stage
.
Then
*NL*
it
struck
me
all
at
once
.
Say
,
you
could
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
*NL*
feather
.
That
's
the
same
name
you
used
out
there
in
Chicago
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Carrie
,
mildly
,
overwhelmed
by
the
man
's
assurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
was
,
the
moment
I
saw
you
.
Well
,
how
have
you
been
,
anyhow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
''
said
Carrie
,
lingering
in
her
dressing-room
.
She
was
*NL*
rather
dazed
by
the
assault
.
``
How
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
Oh
,
fine
.
I
'm
here
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
so
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
've
been
here
for
six
months
.
I
've
got
charge
of
a
branch
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
nice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
when
did
you
go
on
the
stage
,
anyhow
?
''
inquired
Drouet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
three
years
ago
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
so
!
Well
,
sir
,
this
is
the
first
I
've
heard
of
it
.
I
knew
*NL*
you
would
,
though
.
I
always
said
you
could
act
--
did
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
did
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
do
look
great
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
never
saw
anybody
improve
so
.
*NL*
You
're
taller
,
are
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
?
Oh
,
a
little
,
maybe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gazed
at
her
dress
,
then
at
her
hair
,
where
a
becoming
hat
was
set
*NL*
jauntily
,
then
into
her
eyes
,
which
she
took
all
occasion
to
avert
.
*NL*
Evidently
he
expected
to
restore
their
old
friendship
at
once
and
*NL*
without
modification
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
seeing
her
gather
up
her
purse
,
handkerchief
,
and
the
*NL*
like
,
preparatory
to
departing
,
``
I
want
you
to
come
out
to
dinner
with
*NL*
me
;
wo
n't
you
?
I
've
got
a
friend
out
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
ca
n't
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
Not
to-night
.
I
have
an
early
engagement
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
,
let
the
engagement
go
.
Come
on
.
I
can
get
rid
of
him
.
I
want
to
*NL*
have
a
good
talk
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
Carrie
;
``
I
ca
n't
.
You
must
n't
ask
me
any
more
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
for
a
late
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
come
on
and
have
a
talk
,
then
,
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to-night
,
''
she
said
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
We
'll
have
a
talk
some
*NL*
other
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
result
of
this
,
she
noticed
a
shade
of
thought
pass
over
his
face
,
*NL*
as
if
he
were
beginning
to
realise
that
things
were
changed
.
Good-nature
*NL*
dictated
something
better
than
this
for
one
who
had
always
liked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
come
around
to
the
hotel
to-morrow
,
''
she
said
,
as
sort
of
penance
*NL*
for
error
.
``
You
can
take
dinner
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Drouet
,
brightening
.
``
Where
are
you
stopping
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Waldorf
,
''
she
answered
,
mentioning
the
fashionable
hostelry
then
*NL*
but
newly
erected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
come
at
three
,
''
said
Carrie
,
pleasantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
Drouet
called
,
but
it
was
with
no
especial
delight
that
*NL*
Carrie
remembered
her
appointment
.
However
,
seeing
him
,
handsome
as
*NL*
ever
,
after
his
kind
,
and
most
genially
disposed
,
her
doubts
as
to
*NL*
whether
the
dinner
would
be
disagreeable
were
swept
away
.
He
talked
as
*NL*
volubly
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
put
on
a
lot
of
lugs
here
,
do
n't
they
?
''
was
his
first
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
they
do
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Genial
egotist
that
he
was
,
he
went
at
once
into
a
detailed
account
of
*NL*
his
own
career
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
have
a
business
of
my
own
pretty
soon
,
''
he
observed
in
one
*NL*
place
.
``
I
can
get
backing
for
two
hundred
thousand
dollars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
listened
most
good-naturedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
he
said
,
suddenly
;
``
where
is
Hurstwood
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
flushed
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
here
in
New
York
,
I
guess
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
have
n't
seen
him
for
some
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
mused
for
a
moment
.
He
had
not
been
sure
until
now
that
the
*NL*
ex-manager
was
not
an
influential
figure
in
the
background
.
He
imagined
*NL*
not
;
but
this
assurance
relieved
him
.
It
must
be
that
Carrie
had
got
*NL*
rid
of
him
--
as
well
she
ought
,
he
thought
.
``
A
man
always
makes
a
mistake
*NL*
when
he
does
anything
like
that
,
''
he
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
what
?
''
said
Carrie
,
unwitting
of
what
was
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
know
,
''
and
Drouet
waved
her
intelligence
,
as
it
were
,
with
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
,
''
she
answered
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
that
affair
in
Chicago
--
the
time
he
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
are
talking
about
,
''
said
Carrie
.
Could
it
be
he
*NL*
would
refer
so
rudely
to
Hurstwood
's
flight
with
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
!
''
said
Drouet
,
incredulously
.
``
You
knew
he
took
ten
thousand
*NL*
dollars
with
him
when
he
left
,
did
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
Carrie
.
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
say
he
stole
money
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
Drouet
,
puzzled
at
her
tone
,
``
you
knew
that
,
did
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
Of
course
I
did
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
funny
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
He
did
,
you
know
.
It
was
in
all
the
*NL*
papers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
did
you
say
he
took
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
thousand
dollars
.
I
heard
he
sent
most
of
it
back
afterwards
,
*NL*
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
vacantly
at
the
richly
carpeted
floor
.
A
new
light
was
*NL*
shining
upon
all
the
years
since
her
enforced
flight
.
She
remembered
now
*NL*
a
hundred
things
that
indicated
as
much
.
She
also
imagined
that
he
took
*NL*
it
on
her
account
.
Instead
of
hatred
springing
up
there
was
a
kind
of
*NL*
sorrow
generated
.
Poor
fellow
!
What
a
thing
to
have
had
hanging
over
his
*NL*
head
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner
Drouet
,
warmed
up
by
eating
and
drinking
and
softened
in
mood
,
*NL*
fancied
he
was
winning
Carrie
to
her
old-time
good-natured
regard
for
*NL*
him
.
He
began
to
imagine
it
would
not
be
so
difficult
to
enter
into
*NL*
her
life
again
,
high
as
she
was
.
Ah
,
what
a
prize
!
he
thought
.
How
*NL*
beautiful
,
how
elegant
,
how
famous
!
In
her
theatrical
and
Waldorf
*NL*
setting
,
Carrie
was
to
him
the
all
desirable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
how
nervous
you
were
that
night
at
the
Avery
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
smiled
to
think
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
anybody
do
better
than
you
did
then
,
Cad
,
''
he
added
*NL*
ruefully
,
as
he
leaned
an
elbow
on
the
table
;
``
I
thought
you
and
I
were
*NL*
going
to
get
along
fine
those
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
talk
that
way
,
''
said
Carrie
,
bringing
in
the
least
touch
of
*NL*
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
let
me
tell
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
,
rising
.
``
Besides
,
it
's
time
I
was
getting
ready
for
*NL*
the
theatre
.
I
'll
have
to
leave
you
.
Come
,
now
.
''
``
Oh
,
stay
a
minute
,
''
*NL*
pleaded
Drouet
.
``
You
've
got
plenty
of
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Carrie
,
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reluctantly
Drouet
gave
up
the
bright
table
and
followed
.
He
saw
her
to
*NL*
the
elevator
and
,
standing
there
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
I
see
you
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
some
time
,
possibly
,
''
said
Carrie
.
``
I
'll
be
here
all
summer
.
*NL*
Good-night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elevator
door
was
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
!
''
said
Drouet
,
as
she
rustled
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
strolled
sadly
down
the
hall
,
all
his
old
longing
revived
,
*NL*
because
she
was
now
so
far
off
.
The
merry
frou-frou
of
the
place
spoke
*NL*
all
of
her
.
He
thought
himself
hardly
dealt
with
.
Carrie
,
however
,
had
*NL*
other
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
it
was
that
she
passed
Hurstwood
,
waiting
at
the
Casino
,
*NL*
without
observing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
night
,
walking
to
the
theatre
,
she
encountered
him
face
to
*NL*
face
.
He
was
waiting
,
more
gaunt
than
ever
,
determined
to
see
her
,
if
*NL*
he
had
to
send
in
word
.
At
first
she
did
not
recognise
the
shabby
,
baggy
*NL*
figure
.
He
frightened
her
,
edging
so
close
,
a
seemingly
hungry
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
,
''
he
half
whispered
,
``
can
I
have
a
few
words
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
and
recognised
him
on
the
instant
.
If
there
ever
had
lurked
*NL*
any
feeling
in
her
heart
against
him
,
it
deserted
her
now
.
Still
,
she
*NL*
remembered
what
Drouet
said
about
his
having
stolen
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
George
,
''
she
said
;
``
what
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
sick
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
've
just
got
out
of
the
hospital
.
For
*NL*
God
's
sake
,
let
me
have
a
little
money
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
Carrie
,
her
lip
trembling
in
a
strong
effort
to
*NL*
maintain
her
composure
.
``
But
what
's
the
matter
with
you
,
anyhow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
opening
her
purse
,
and
now
pulled
out
all
the
bills
in
it
--
a
*NL*
five
and
two
twos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
sick
,
I
told
you
,
''
he
said
,
peevishly
,
almost
resenting
her
*NL*
excessive
pity
.
It
came
hard
to
him
to
receive
it
from
such
a
source
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
all
I
have
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
answered
,
softly
.
``
I
'll
give
it
back
to
you
some
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
at
him
,
while
pedestrians
stared
at
her
.
She
felt
the
*NL*
strain
of
publicity
.
So
did
Hurstwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
tell
me
what
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
she
asked
,
hardly
*NL*
knowing
what
to
do
.
``
Where
are
you
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
've
got
a
room
down
in
the
Bowery
,
''
he
answered
.
``
There
's
no
use
*NL*
trying
to
tell
you
here
.
I
'm
all
right
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
in
a
way
to
resent
her
kindly
inquiries
--
so
much
better
had
*NL*
fate
dealt
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
go
on
in
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
much
obliged
,
but
I
wo
n't
bother
you
*NL*
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
answer
,
but
he
turned
away
and
shuffled
off
toward
the
*NL*
east
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
days
this
apparition
was
a
drag
on
her
soul
before
it
began
to
wear
*NL*
partially
away
.
Drouet
called
again
,
but
now
he
was
not
even
seen
by
*NL*
her
.
His
attentions
seemed
out
of
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
out
,
''
was
her
reply
to
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
peculiar
,
indeed
,
was
her
lonely
,
self-withdrawing
temper
,
that
she
*NL*
was
becoming
an
interesting
figure
in
the
public
eye
--
she
was
so
quiet
*NL*
and
reserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
the
management
decided
to
transfer
the
show
to
London
.
A
*NL*
second
summer
season
did
not
seem
to
promise
well
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
would
you
like
to
try
subduing
London
?
''
asked
her
manager
,
one
*NL*
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
be
just
the
other
way
,
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
we
'll
go
in
June
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hurry
of
departure
,
Hurstwood
was
forgotten
.
Both
he
and
Drouet
*NL*
were
left
to
discover
that
she
was
gone
.
The
latter
called
once
,
and
*NL*
exclaimed
at
the
news
.
Then
he
stood
in
the
lobby
,
chewing
the
ends
of
*NL*
his
moustache
.
At
last
he
reached
a
conclusion
--
the
old
days
had
gone
*NL*
for
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
n't
so
much
,
''
he
said
;
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
did
not
*NL*
believe
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
shifted
by
curious
means
through
a
long
summer
and
fall
.
A
*NL*
small
job
as
janitor
of
a
dance
hall
helped
him
for
a
month
.
Begging
,
*NL*
sometimes
going
hungry
,
sometimes
sleeping
in
the
park
,
carried
him
over
*NL*
more
days
.
Resorting
to
those
peculiar
charities
,
several
of
which
,
in
*NL*
the
press
of
hungry
search
,
he
accidentally
stumbled
upon
,
did
the
rest
.
*NL*
Toward
the
dead
of
winter
,
Carrie
came
back
,
appearing
on
Broadway
in
*NL*
a
new
play
;
but
he
was
not
aware
of
it
.
For
weeks
he
wandered
about
the
*NL*
city
,
begging
,
while
the
fire
sign
,
announcing
her
engagement
,
blazed
*NL*
nightly
upon
the
crowded
street
of
amusements
.
Drouet
saw
it
,
but
did
*NL*
not
venture
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
Ames
returned
to
New
York
.
He
had
made
a
little
success
*NL*
in
the
West
,
and
now
opened
a
laboratory
in
Wooster
Street
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
he
encountered
Carrie
through
Mrs.
Vance
;
but
there
was
nothing
*NL*
responsive
between
them
.
He
thought
she
was
still
united
to
Hurstwood
,
*NL*
until
otherwise
informed
.
Not
knowing
the
facts
then
,
he
did
not
profess
*NL*
to
understand
,
and
refrained
from
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Mrs.
Vance
,
he
saw
the
new
play
,
and
expressed
himself
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ought
not
to
be
in
comedy
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
think
she
could
do
better
*NL*
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
they
met
at
the
Vances
'
accidentally
,
and
began
a
very
*NL*
friendly
conversation
.
She
could
hardly
tell
why
the
one-time
keen
*NL*
interest
in
him
was
no
longer
with
her
.
Unquestionably
,
it
was
because
*NL*
at
that
time
he
had
represented
something
which
she
did
not
have
;
but
*NL*
this
she
did
not
understand
.
Success
had
given
her
the
momentary
feeling
*NL*
that
she
was
now
blessed
with
much
of
which
he
would
approve
.
As
a
*NL*
matter
of
fact
,
her
little
newspaper
fame
was
nothing
at
all
to
him
.
He
*NL*
thought
she
could
have
done
better
,
by
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
go
into
comedy-drama
,
after
all
?
''
he
said
,
remembering
her
*NL*
interest
in
that
form
of
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
;
``
I
have
n't
,
so
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
in
such
a
peculiar
way
that
she
realised
she
had
*NL*
failed
.
It
moved
her
to
add
:
``
I
want
to
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
you
would
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
have
the
sort
of
disposition
*NL*
that
would
do
well
in
comedy-drama
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
surprised
her
that
he
should
speak
of
disposition
.
Was
she
,
then
,
so
*NL*
clearly
in
his
mind
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
should
judge
you
were
rather
sympathetic
in
your
*NL*
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
smiled
and
coloured
slightly
.
He
was
so
innocently
frank
with
*NL*
her
that
she
drew
nearer
in
friendship
.
The
old
call
of
the
ideal
was
*NL*
sounding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
answered
,
pleased
,
nevertheless
,
beyond
all
*NL*
concealment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
your
play
,
''
he
remarked
.
``
It
's
very
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
liked
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
indeed
,
''
he
said
,
``
for
a
comedy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
all
that
was
said
at
the
time
,
owing
to
an
interruption
,
but
*NL*
later
they
met
again
.
He
was
sitting
in
a
corner
after
dinner
,
staring
*NL*
at
the
floor
,
when
Carrie
came
up
with
another
of
the
guests
.
Hard
work
*NL*
had
given
his
face
the
look
of
one
who
is
weary
.
It
was
not
for
Carrie
*NL*
to
know
the
thing
in
it
which
appealed
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
alone
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
listening
to
the
music
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
back
in
a
moment
,
''
said
her
companion
,
who
saw
nothing
in
the
*NL*
inventor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
he
looked
up
in
her
face
,
for
she
was
standing
a
moment
,
while
he
*NL*
sat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
that
a
pathetic
strain
?
''
he
inquired
,
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
,
''
she
returned
,
also
catching
it
,
now
that
her
attention
was
*NL*
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
he
added
,
offering
her
the
chair
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
listened
a
few
moments
in
silence
,
touched
by
the
same
feeling
,
*NL*
only
hers
reached
her
through
the
heart
.
Music
still
charmed
her
as
in
*NL*
the
old
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
it
is
about
music
,
''
she
started
to
say
,
moved
by
the
*NL*
inexplicable
longings
which
surged
within
her
;
``
but
it
always
makes
me
*NL*
feel
as
if
I
wanted
something
--
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
;
``
I
know
how
you
feel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
turned
to
considering
the
peculiarity
of
her
disposition
,
*NL*
expressing
her
feelings
so
frankly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
not
to
be
melancholy
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
a
while
,
and
then
went
off
into
a
seemingly
alien
observation
*NL*
which
,
however
,
accorded
with
their
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
world
is
full
of
desirable
situations
,
but
,
unfortunately
,
we
can
*NL*
occupy
but
one
at
a
time
.
It
does
n't
do
us
any
good
to
wring
our
hands
*NL*
over
the
far-off
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
music
ceased
and
he
arose
,
taking
a
standing
position
before
her
,
as
*NL*
if
to
rest
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
get
into
some
good
,
strong
comedy-drama
?
''
he
said
.
He
was
*NL*
looking
directly
at
her
now
,
studying
her
face
.
Her
large
,
sympathetic
*NL*
eyes
and
pain-touched
mouth
appealed
to
him
as
proofs
of
his
judgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
shall
,
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
your
field
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
do
.
I
do
n't
suppose
you
're
aware
of
it
,
but
there
*NL*
is
something
about
your
eyes
and
mouth
which
fits
you
for
that
sort
of
*NL*
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
thrilled
to
be
taken
so
seriously
.
For
the
moment
,
loneliness
*NL*
deserted
her
.
Here
was
praise
which
was
keen
and
analytical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
in
your
eyes
and
mouth
,
''
he
went
on
abstractedly
.
``
I
remember
*NL*
thinking
,
the
first
time
I
saw
you
,
that
there
was
something
peculiar
*NL*
about
your
mouth
.
I
thought
you
were
about
to
cry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
odd
,
''
said
Carrie
,
warm
with
delight
.
This
was
what
her
heart
*NL*
craved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
noticed
that
that
was
your
natural
look
,
and
to-night
I
saw
it
*NL*
again
.
There
's
a
shadow
about
your
eyes
,
too
,
which
gives
your
face
much
*NL*
this
same
character
.
It
's
in
the
depth
of
them
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
looked
straight
into
his
face
,
wholly
aroused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
probably
are
not
aware
of
it
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
away
,
pleased
that
he
should
speak
thus
,
longing
to
be
equal
*NL*
to
this
feeling
written
upon
her
countenance
.
It
unlocked
the
door
to
*NL*
a
new
desire
.
She
had
cause
to
ponder
over
this
until
they
met
*NL*
again
--
several
weeks
or
more
.
It
showed
her
she
was
drifting
away
from
*NL*
the
old
ideal
which
had
filled
her
in
the
dressing-rooms
of
the
Avery
*NL*
stage
and
thereafter
,
for
a
long
time
.
Why
had
she
lost
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
why
you
should
be
a
success
,
''
he
said
,
another
time
,
``
if
you
had
*NL*
a
more
dramatic
part
.
I
've
studied
it
out
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
as
one
pleased
with
a
puzzle
,
``
the
expression
in
your
*NL*
face
is
one
that
comes
out
in
different
things
.
You
get
the
same
thing
*NL*
in
a
pathetic
song
,
or
any
picture
which
moves
you
deeply
.
It
's
a
*NL*
thing
the
world
likes
to
see
,
because
it
's
a
natural
expression
of
its
*NL*
longing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
gazed
without
exactly
getting
the
import
of
what
he
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
world
is
always
struggling
to
express
itself
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
Most
*NL*
people
are
not
capable
of
voicing
their
feelings
.
They
depend
upon
*NL*
others
.
That
is
what
genius
is
for
.
One
man
expresses
their
desires
for
*NL*
them
in
music
;
another
one
in
poetry
;
another
one
in
a
play
.
Sometimes
*NL*
nature
does
it
in
a
face
--
it
makes
the
face
representative
of
all
*NL*
desire
.
That
's
what
has
happened
in
your
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
with
so
much
of
the
import
of
the
thing
in
his
eyes
*NL*
that
she
caught
it
.
At
least
,
she
got
the
idea
that
her
look
was
*NL*
something
which
represented
the
world
's
longing
.
She
took
it
to
heart
as
*NL*
a
creditable
thing
,
until
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
puts
a
burden
of
duty
on
you
.
It
so
happens
that
you
have
this
*NL*
thing
.
It
is
no
credit
to
you
--
that
is
,
I
mean
,
you
might
not
have
had
*NL*
it
.
You
paid
nothing
to
get
it
.
But
now
that
you
have
it
,
you
must
do
*NL*
something
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
asked
Carrie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
say
,
turn
to
the
dramatic
field
.
You
have
so
much
sympathy
and
*NL*
such
a
melodious
voice
.
Make
them
valuable
to
others
.
It
will
make
your
*NL*
powers
endure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
did
not
understand
this
last
.
All
the
rest
showed
her
that
her
*NL*
comedy
success
was
little
or
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
just
this
.
You
have
this
quality
in
your
eyes
and
mouth
and
in
*NL*
your
nature
.
You
can
lose
it
,
you
know
.
If
you
turn
away
from
it
and
*NL*
live
to
satisfy
yourself
alone
,
it
will
go
fast
enough
.
The
look
*NL*
will
leave
your
eyes
.
Your
mouth
will
change
.
Your
power
to
act
will
*NL*
disappear
.
You
may
think
they
wo
n't
,
but
they
will
.
Nature
takes
care
of
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
interested
in
forwarding
all
good
causes
that
he
sometimes
*NL*
became
enthusiastic
,
giving
vent
to
these
preachments
.
Something
in
*NL*
Carrie
appealed
to
him
.
He
wanted
to
stir
her
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
she
said
,
absently
,
feeling
slightly
guilty
of
neglect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'd
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
of
this
was
like
roiling
helpless
waters
.
Carrie
troubled
*NL*
over
it
in
her
rocking-chair
for
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
I
'll
stay
in
comedy
so
very
much
longer
,
''
she
*NL*
eventually
remarked
to
Lola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
why
not
?
''
said
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
can
do
better
in
a
serious
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
put
that
idea
in
your
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
,
''
she
answered
;
``
I
've
always
thought
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
she
did
nothing
--
grieving
.
It
was
a
long
way
to
this
better
*NL*
thing
--
or
seemed
so
--
and
comfort
was
about
her
;
hence
the
inactivity
and
*NL*
longing
.

Chapter
XLVII

THE
WAY
OF
THE
BEATEN
--
A
HARP
IN
THE
WIND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
city
,
at
that
time
,
there
were
a
number
of
charities
similar
in
*NL*
nature
to
that
of
the
captain
's
,
which
Hurstwood
now
patronised
in
a
*NL*
like
unfortunate
way
.
One
was
a
convent
mission-house
of
the
Sisters
of
*NL*
Mercy
in
Fifteenth
Street
--
a
row
of
red
brick
family
dwellings
,
before
*NL*
the
door
of
which
hung
a
plain
wooden
contribution
box
,
on
which
was
*NL*
painted
the
statement
that
every
noon
a
meal
was
given
free
to
all
those
*NL*
who
might
apply
and
ask
for
aid
.
This
simple
announcement
was
modest
in
*NL*
the
extreme
,
covering
,
as
it
did
,
a
charity
so
broad
.
Institutions
and
*NL*
charities
are
so
large
and
so
numerous
in
New
York
that
such
things
as
*NL*
this
are
not
often
noticed
by
the
more
comfortably
situated
.
But
to
one
*NL*
whose
mind
is
upon
the
matter
,
they
grow
exceedingly
under
inspection
.
*NL*
Unless
one
were
looking
up
this
matter
in
particular
,
he
could
have
*NL*
stood
at
Sixth
Avenue
and
Fifteenth
Street
for
days
around
the
noon
hour
*NL*
and
never
have
noticed
that
out
of
the
vast
crowd
that
surged
along
*NL*
that
busy
thoroughfare
there
turned
out
,
every
few
seconds
,
some
*NL*
weather-beaten
,
heavy-footed
specimen
of
humanity
,
gaunt
in
countenance
*NL*
and
dilapidated
in
the
matter
of
clothes
.
The
fact
is
none
the
less
*NL*
true
,
however
,
and
the
colder
the
day
the
more
apparent
it
became
.
*NL*
Space
and
a
lack
of
culinary
room
in
the
mission-house
,
compelled
an
*NL*
arrangement
which
permitted
of
only
twenty-five
or
thirty
eating
at
one
*NL*
time
,
so
that
a
line
had
to
be
formed
outside
and
an
orderly
entrance
*NL*
effected
.
This
caused
a
daily
spectacle
which
,
however
,
had
become
*NL*
so
common
by
repetition
during
a
number
of
years
that
now
nothing
was
*NL*
thought
of
it
.
The
men
waited
patiently
,
like
cattle
,
in
the
coldest
*NL*
weather
--
waited
for
several
hours
before
they
could
be
admitted
.
No
*NL*
questions
were
asked
and
no
service
rendered
.
They
ate
and
went
away
*NL*
again
,
some
of
them
returning
regularly
day
after
day
the
winter
*NL*
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
big
,
motherly
looking
woman
invariably
stood
guard
at
the
door
during
*NL*
the
entire
operation
and
counted
the
admissible
number
.
The
men
moved
up
*NL*
in
solemn
order
.
There
was
no
haste
and
no
eagerness
displayed
.
It
was
*NL*
almost
a
dumb
procession
.
In
the
bitterest
weather
this
line
was
to
be
*NL*
found
here
.
Under
an
icy
wind
there
was
a
prodigious
slapping
of
hands
*NL*
and
a
dancing
of
feet
.
Fingers
and
the
features
of
the
face
looked
as
if
*NL*
severely
nipped
by
the
cold
.
A
study
of
these
men
in
broad
light
proved
*NL*
them
to
be
nearly
all
of
a
type
.
They
belonged
to
the
class
that
sit
on
*NL*
the
park
benches
during
the
endurable
days
and
sleep
upon
them
during
*NL*
the
summer
nights
.
They
frequent
the
Bowery
and
those
down-at-the-heels
*NL*
East
Side
streets
where
poor
clothes
and
shrunken
features
are
not
*NL*
singled
out
as
curious
.
They
are
the
men
who
are
in
the
lodginghouse
*NL*
sitting-rooms
during
bleak
and
bitter
weather
and
who
swarm
about
the
*NL*
cheaper
shelters
which
only
open
at
six
in
a
number
of
the
lower
East
*NL*
Side
streets
.
Miserable
food
,
ill-timed
and
greedily
eaten
,
had
played
*NL*
havoc
with
bone
and
muscle
.
They
were
all
pale
,
flabby
,
sunken-eyed
,
*NL*
hollow-chested
,
with
eyes
that
glinted
and
shone
and
lips
that
were
a
*NL*
sickly
red
by
contrast
.
Their
hair
was
but
half
attended
to
,
their
ears
*NL*
anaemic
in
hue
,
and
their
shoes
broken
in
leather
and
run
down
at
heel
*NL*
and
toe
.
They
were
of
the
class
which
simply
floats
and
drifts
,
every
*NL*
wave
of
people
washing
up
one
,
as
breakers
do
driftwood
upon
a
stormy
*NL*
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
century
,
in
another
section
of
the
city
,
*NL*
Fleischmann
,
the
baker
,
had
given
a
loaf
of
bread
to
any
one
who
would
*NL*
come
for
it
to
the
side
door
of
his
restaurant
at
the
corner
of
Broadway
*NL*
and
Tenth
Street
,
at
midnight
.
Every
night
during
twenty
years
about
*NL*
three
hundred
men
had
formed
in
line
and
at
the
appointed
time
marched
*NL*
past
the
doorway
,
picked
their
loaf
from
a
great
box
placed
just
*NL*
outside
,
and
vanished
again
into
the
night
.
From
the
beginning
to
the
*NL*
present
time
there
had
been
little
change
in
the
character
or
number
of
*NL*
these
men
.
There
were
two
or
three
figures
that
had
grown
familiar
to
*NL*
those
who
had
seen
this
little
procession
pass
year
after
year
.
Two
*NL*
of
them
had
missed
scarcely
a
night
in
fifteen
years
.
There
were
about
*NL*
forty
,
more
or
less
,
regular
callers
.
The
remainder
of
the
line
was
*NL*
formed
of
strangers
.
In
times
of
panic
and
unusual
hardships
there
were
*NL*
seldom
more
than
three
hundred
.
In
times
of
prosperity
,
when
little
is
*NL*
heard
of
the
unemployed
,
there
were
seldom
less
.
The
same
number
,
*NL*
winter
and
summer
,
in
storm
or
calm
,
in
good
times
and
bad
,
held
this
*NL*
melancholy
midnight
rendezvous
at
Fleischmann
's
bread
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
both
of
these
two
charities
,
during
the
severe
winter
which
was
now
*NL*
on
,
Hurstwood
was
a
frequent
visitor
.
On
one
occasion
it
was
peculiarly
*NL*
cold
,
and
finding
no
comfort
in
begging
about
the
streets
,
he
waited
*NL*
until
noon
before
seeking
this
free
offering
to
the
poor
.
Already
,
at
*NL*
eleven
o'clock
of
this
morning
,
several
such
as
he
had
shambled
forward
*NL*
out
of
Sixth
Avenue
,
their
thin
clothes
flapping
and
fluttering
in
the
*NL*
wind
.
They
leaned
against
the
iron
railing
which
protects
the
walls
of
*NL*
the
Ninth
Regiment
Armory
,
which
fronts
upon
that
section
of
Fifteenth
*NL*
Street
,
having
come
early
in
order
to
be
first
in
.
Having
an
hour
to
*NL*
wait
,
they
at
first
lingered
at
a
respectful
distance
;
but
others
coming
*NL*
up
,
they
moved
closer
in
order
to
protect
their
right
of
precedence
.
To
*NL*
this
collection
Hurstwood
came
up
from
the
west
out
of
Seventh
Avenue
*NL*
and
stopped
close
to
the
door
,
nearer
than
all
the
others
.
Those
who
*NL*
had
been
waiting
before
him
,
but
farther
away
,
now
drew
near
,
and
by
a
*NL*
certain
stolidity
of
demeanour
,
no
words
being
spoken
,
indicated
that
*NL*
they
were
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
the
opposition
to
his
action
,
he
looked
sullenly
along
the
*NL*
line
,
then
moved
out
,
taking
his
place
at
the
foot
.
When
order
had
been
*NL*
restored
,
the
animal
feeling
of
opposition
relaxed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
be
pretty
near
noon
,
''
ventured
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
''
said
another
.
``
I
've
been
waiting
nearly
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gee
,
but
it
's
cold
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
peered
eagerly
at
the
door
,
where
all
must
enter
.
A
grocery
man
*NL*
drove
up
and
carried
in
several
baskets
of
eatables
.
This
started
some
*NL*
words
upon
grocery
men
and
the
cost
of
food
in
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
meat
's
gone
up
,
''
said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
wuz
war
,
it
would
help
this
country
a
lot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
line
was
growing
rapidly
.
Already
there
were
fifty
or
more
,
*NL*
and
those
at
the
head
,
by
their
demeanour
,
evidently
congratulated
*NL*
themselves
upon
not
having
so
long
to
wait
as
those
at
the
foot
.
There
*NL*
was
much
jerking
of
heads
,
and
looking
down
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
do
n't
matter
how
near
you
get
to
the
front
,
so
long
as
you
're
in
the
*NL*
first
twenty-five
,
''
commented
one
of
the
first
twenty-five
.
``
You
all
go
*NL*
in
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph
!
''
ejaculated
Hurstwood
,
who
had
been
so
sturdily
displaced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
here
Single
Tax
is
the
thing
,
''
said
another
.
``
There
ai
n't
going
to
*NL*
be
no
order
till
it
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
most
part
there
was
silence
;
gaunt
men
shuffling
,
glancing
,
and
*NL*
beating
their
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
door
opened
and
the
motherly-looking
sister
appeared
.
She
*NL*
only
looked
an
order
.
Slowly
the
line
moved
up
and
,
one
by
one
,
passed
*NL*
in
,
until
twenty-five
were
counted
.
Then
she
interposed
a
stout
arm
,
and
*NL*
the
line
halted
,
with
six
men
on
the
steps
.
Of
these
the
ex-manager
was
*NL*
one
.
Waiting
thus
,
some
talked
,
some
ejaculated
concerning
the
misery
of
*NL*
it
;
some
brooded
,
as
did
Hurstwood
.
At
last
he
was
admitted
,
and
,
having
*NL*
eaten
,
came
away
,
almost
angered
because
of
his
pains
in
getting
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eleven
o'clock
of
another
evening
,
perhaps
two
weeks
later
,
he
was
*NL*
at
the
midnight
offering
of
a
loaf
--
waiting
patiently
.
It
had
been
*NL*
an
unfortunate
day
with
him
,
but
now
he
took
his
fate
with
a
touch
of
*NL*
philosophy
.
If
he
could
secure
no
supper
,
or
was
hungry
late
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
here
was
a
place
he
could
come
.
A
few
minutes
before
twelve
,
*NL*
a
great
box
of
bread
was
pushed
out
,
and
exactly
on
the
hour
a
portly
,
*NL*
round-faced
German
took
position
by
it
,
calling
``
Ready
.
''
The
whole
*NL*
line
at
once
moved
forward
each
taking
his
loaf
in
turn
and
going
*NL*
his
separate
way
.
On
this
occasion
,
the
ex-manager
ate
his
as
he
went
*NL*
plodding
the
dark
streets
in
silence
to
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
January
he
had
about
concluded
that
the
game
was
up
with
him
.
Life
*NL*
had
always
seemed
a
precious
thing
,
but
now
constant
want
and
weakened
*NL*
vitality
had
made
the
charms
of
earth
rather
dull
and
inconspicuous
.
*NL*
Several
times
,
when
fortune
pressed
most
harshly
,
he
thought
he
would
*NL*
end
his
troubles
;
but
with
a
change
of
weather
,
or
the
arrival
of
a
*NL*
quarter
or
a
dime
,
his
mood
would
change
,
and
he
would
wait
.
Each
day
he
*NL*
would
find
some
old
paper
lying
about
and
look
into
it
,
to
see
if
there
*NL*
was
any
trace
of
Carrie
,
but
all
summer
and
fall
he
had
looked
in
vain
.
*NL*
Then
he
noticed
that
his
eyes
were
beginning
to
hurt
him
,
and
this
*NL*
ailment
rapidly
increased
until
,
in
the
dark
chambers
of
the
lodgings
*NL*
he
frequented
,
he
did
not
attempt
to
read
.
Bad
and
irregular
eating
was
*NL*
weakening
every
function
of
his
body
.
The
one
recourse
left
him
was
to
*NL*
doze
when
a
place
offered
and
he
could
get
the
money
to
occupy
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
beginning
to
find
,
in
his
wretched
clothing
and
meagre
state
of
*NL*
body
,
that
people
took
him
for
a
chronic
type
of
bum
and
beggar
.
Police
*NL*
hustled
him
along
,
restaurant
and
lodginghouse
keepers
turned
him
out
*NL*
promptly
the
moment
he
had
his
due
;
pedestrians
waved
him
off
.
He
found
*NL*
it
more
and
more
difficult
to
get
anything
from
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
admitted
to
himself
that
the
game
was
up
.
It
was
after
a
*NL*
long
series
of
appeals
to
pedestrians
,
in
which
he
had
been
refused
and
*NL*
refused
--
every
one
hastening
from
contact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
a
little
something
,
will
you
,
mister
?
''
he
said
to
the
last
one
.
*NL*
``
For
God
's
sake
,
do
;
I
'm
starving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw
,
get
out
,
''
said
the
man
,
who
happened
to
be
a
common
type
himself
.
*NL*
``
You
're
no
good
.
I
'll
give
you
nawthin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
put
his
hands
,
red
from
cold
,
down
in
his
pockets
.
Tears
came
*NL*
into
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
'm
no
good
now
.
I
was
all
right
.
I
had
money
.
*NL*
I
'm
going
to
quit
this
,
''
and
,
with
death
in
his
heart
,
he
started
down
*NL*
toward
the
Bowery
.
People
had
turned
on
the
gas
before
and
died
;
why
*NL*
should
n't
he
?
He
remembered
a
lodginghouse
where
there
were
little
,
*NL*
close
rooms
,
with
gas-jets
in
them
,
almost
pre-arranged
,
he
thought
,
for
*NL*
what
he
wanted
to
do
,
which
rented
for
fifteen
cents
.
Then
he
remembered
*NL*
that
he
had
no
fifteen
cents
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
he
met
a
comfortable-looking
gentleman
,
coming
,
clean-shaven
,
*NL*
out
of
a
fine
barber
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
mind
giving
me
a
little
something
?
''
he
asked
this
man
boldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
looked
him
over
and
fished
for
a
dime
.
Nothing
but
*NL*
quarters
were
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
he
said
,
handing
him
one
,
to
be
rid
of
him
.
``
Be
off
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
moved
on
,
wondering
.
The
sight
of
the
large
,
bright
coin
*NL*
pleased
him
a
little
.
He
remembered
that
he
was
hungry
and
that
he
could
*NL*
get
a
bed
for
ten
cents
.
With
this
,
the
idea
of
death
passed
,
for
the
*NL*
time
being
,
out
of
his
mind
.
It
was
only
when
he
could
get
nothing
but
*NL*
insults
that
death
seemed
worth
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
in
the
middle
of
the
winter
,
the
sharpest
spell
of
the
season
*NL*
set
in
.
It
broke
grey
and
cold
in
the
first
day
,
and
on
the
second
*NL*
snowed
.
Poor
luck
pursuing
him
,
he
had
secured
but
ten
cents
by
*NL*
nightfall
,
and
this
he
had
spent
for
food
.
At
evening
he
found
himself
*NL*
at
the
Boulevard
and
Sixty-seventh
Street
,
where
he
finally
turned
*NL*
his
face
Bowery-ward
.
Especially
fatigued
because
of
the
wandering
*NL*
propensity
which
had
seized
him
in
the
morning
,
he
now
half
dragged
his
*NL*
wet
feet
,
shuffling
the
soles
upon
the
sidewalk
.
An
old
,
thin
coat
was
*NL*
turned
up
about
his
red
ears
--
his
cracked
derby
hat
was
pulled
down
*NL*
until
it
turned
them
outward
.
His
hands
were
in
his
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
just
go
down
Broadway
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
Forty-second
Street
,
the
fire
signs
were
already
blazing
*NL*
brightly
.
Crowds
were
hastening
to
dine
.
Through
bright
windows
,
at
*NL*
every
corner
,
might
be
seen
gay
companies
in
luxuriant
restaurants
.
*NL*
There
were
coaches
and
crowded
cable
cars
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
weary
and
hungry
state
,
he
should
never
have
come
here
.
The
*NL*
contrast
was
too
sharp
.
Even
he
was
recalled
keenly
to
better
things
.
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
?
''
he
thought
.
``
It
's
all
up
with
me
.
I
'll
quit
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
People
turned
to
look
after
him
,
so
uncouth
was
his
shambling
figure
.
*NL*
Several
officers
followed
him
with
their
eyes
,
to
see
that
he
did
not
*NL*
beg
of
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
paused
in
an
aimless
,
incoherent
sort
of
way
and
looked
through
*NL*
the
windows
of
an
imposing
restaurant
,
before
which
blazed
a
fire
sign
,
*NL*
and
through
the
large
,
plate
windows
of
which
could
be
seen
the
red
and
*NL*
gold
decorations
,
the
palms
,
the
white
napery
,
and
shining
glassware
,
*NL*
and
,
above
all
,
the
comfortable
crowd
.
Weak
as
his
mind
had
become
,
his
*NL*
hunger
was
sharp
enough
to
show
the
importance
of
this
.
He
stopped
stock
*NL*
still
,
his
frayed
trousers
soaking
in
the
slush
,
and
peered
foolishly
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eat
,
''
he
mumbled
.
``
That
's
right
,
eat
.
Nobody
else
wants
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
voice
dropped
even
lower
,
and
his
mind
half
lost
the
fancy
it
*NL*
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
mighty
cold
,
''
he
said
.
``
Awful
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
Broadway
and
Thirty-ninth
Street
was
blazing
,
in
incandescent
fire
,
*NL*
Carrie
's
name
.
``
Carrie
Madenda
,
''
it
read
,
``
and
the
Casino
Company
.
''
All
*NL*
the
wet
,
snowy
sidewalk
was
bright
with
this
radiated
fire
.
It
was
so
*NL*
bright
that
it
attracted
Hurstwood
's
gaze
.
He
looked
up
,
and
then
at
*NL*
a
large
,
gilt-framed
posterboard
,
on
which
was
a
fine
lithograph
of
*NL*
Carrie
,
lifesize
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
gazed
at
it
a
moment
,
snuffling
and
hunching
one
shoulder
,
as
*NL*
if
something
were
scratching
him
.
He
was
so
run
down
,
however
,
that
his
*NL*
mind
was
not
exactly
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
that
entrance
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
the
attendant
,
staring
at
him
.
Seeing
him
pause
,
he
went
*NL*
over
and
shoved
him
.
``
Get
out
of
here
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
Miss
Madenda
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
,
eh
?
''
the
other
said
,
almost
tickled
at
the
spectacle
.
``
Get
out
*NL*
of
here
,
''
and
he
shoved
him
again
.
Hurstwood
had
no
strength
to
resist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
Miss
Madenda
,
''
he
tried
to
explain
,
even
as
he
was
being
*NL*
hustled
away
.
``
I
'm
all
right
.
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
gave
him
a
last
push
and
closed
the
door
.
As
he
did
so
,
*NL*
Hurstwood
slipped
and
fell
in
the
snow
.
It
hurt
him
,
and
some
vague
*NL*
sense
of
shame
returned
.
He
began
to
cry
and
swear
foolishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
damned
dog
!
''
he
said
.
``
Damned
old
cur
,
''
wiping
the
slush
from
his
*NL*
worthless
coat
.
``
I
--
I
hired
such
people
as
you
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
a
fierce
feeling
against
Carrie
welled
up
--
just
one
fierce
,
angry
*NL*
thought
before
the
whole
thing
slipped
out
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
owes
me
something
to
eat
,
''
he
said
.
``
She
owes
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hopelessly
he
turned
back
into
Broadway
again
and
slopped
onward
and
*NL*
away
,
begging
,
crying
,
losing
track
of
his
thoughts
,
one
after
another
,
*NL*
as
a
mind
decayed
and
disjointed
is
wont
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
truly
a
wintry
evening
,
a
few
days
later
,
when
his
one
distinct
*NL*
mental
decision
was
reached
.
Already
,
at
four
o'clock
,
the
sombre
hue
of
*NL*
night
was
thickening
the
air
.
A
heavy
snow
was
falling
--
a
fine
picking
,
*NL*
whipping
snow
,
borne
forward
by
a
swift
wind
in
long
,
thin
lines
.
The
*NL*
streets
were
bedded
with
it
--
six
inches
of
cold
,
soft
carpet
,
churned
to
*NL*
a
dirty
brown
by
the
crush
of
teams
and
the
feet
of
men
.
Along
Broadway
*NL*
men
picked
their
way
in
ulsters
and
umbrellas
.
Along
the
Bowery
,
men
*NL*
slouched
through
it
with
collars
and
hats
pulled
over
their
ears
.
In
*NL*
the
former
thoroughfare
businessmen
and
travellers
were
making
for
*NL*
comfortable
hotels
.
In
the
latter
,
crowds
on
cold
errands
shifted
*NL*
past
dingy
stores
,
in
the
deep
recesses
of
which
lights
were
already
*NL*
gleaming
.
There
were
early
lights
in
the
cable
cars
,
whose
usual
clatter
*NL*
was
reduced
by
the
mantle
about
the
wheels
.
The
whole
city
was
muffled
*NL*
by
this
fast-thickening
mantle
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
comfortable
chambers
at
the
Waldorf
,
Carrie
was
reading
at
this
*NL*
time
``
Pere
Goriot
,
''
which
Ames
had
recommended
to
her
.
It
was
so
strong
,
*NL*
and
Ames
's
mere
recommendation
had
so
aroused
her
interest
,
that
she
*NL*
caught
nearly
the
full
sympathetic
significance
of
it
.
For
the
first
*NL*
time
,
it
was
being
borne
in
upon
her
how
silly
and
worthless
had
been
*NL*
her
earlier
reading
,
as
a
whole
.
Becoming
wearied
,
however
,
she
yawned
*NL*
and
came
to
the
window
,
looking
out
upon
the
old
winding
procession
of
*NL*
carriages
rolling
up
Fifth
Avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
bad
?
''
she
observed
to
Lola
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Terrible
!
''
said
that
little
lady
,
joining
her
.
``
I
hope
it
snows
enough
*NL*
to
go
sleigh
riding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
''
said
Carrie
,
with
whom
the
sufferings
of
Father
Goriot
were
*NL*
still
keen
.
``
That
's
all
you
think
of
.
Are
n't
you
sorry
for
the
people
*NL*
who
have
n't
anything
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
am
,
''
said
Lola
;
``
but
what
can
I
do
?
I
have
n't
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carrie
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
care
,
if
you
had
,
''
she
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
,
too
,
''
said
Lola
.
``
But
people
never
gave
me
anything
when
I
was
*NL*
hard
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
just
awful
?
''
said
Carrie
,
studying
the
winter
's
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
that
man
over
there
,
''
laughed
Lola
,
who
had
caught
sight
of
*NL*
some
one
falling
down
.
``
How
sheepish
men
look
when
they
fall
,
do
n't
*NL*
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
have
to
take
a
coach
to-night
,
''
answered
Carrie
absently
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
lobby
of
the
Imperial
,
Mr.
Charles
Drouet
was
just
arriving
,
*NL*
shaking
the
snow
from
a
very
handsome
ulster
.
Bad
weather
had
driven
him
*NL*
home
early
and
stirred
his
desire
for
those
pleasures
which
shut
out
the
*NL*
snow
and
gloom
of
life
.
A
good
dinner
,
the
company
of
a
young
woman
,
and
*NL*
an
evening
at
the
theatre
were
the
chief
things
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
hello
,
Harry
!
''
he
said
,
addressing
a
lounger
in
one
of
the
*NL*
comfortable
lobby
chairs
.
``
How
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
about
six
and
six
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
Rotten
weather
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
say
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
I
've
been
just
sitting
here
*NL*
thinking
where
I
'd
go
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
with
me
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
I
can
introduce
you
to
something
*NL*
dead
swell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
?
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
a
couple
of
girls
over
here
in
Fortieth
Street
.
We
could
have
a
*NL*
dandy
time
.
I
was
just
looking
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Supposing
you
get
'em
and
take
'em
out
to
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
said
Drouet
.
``
Wait
'll
I
go
upstairs
and
change
my
clothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
be
in
the
barber
shop
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
I
want
to
get
a
*NL*
shave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Drouet
,
creaking
off
in
his
good
shoes
toward
the
*NL*
elevator
.
The
old
butterfly
was
as
light
on
the
wing
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
an
incoming
vestibuled
Pullman
,
speeding
at
forty
miles
an
hour
*NL*
through
the
snow
of
the
evening
,
were
three
others
,
all
related
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
call
for
dinner
in
the
dining-car
,
''
a
Pullman
servitor
was
*NL*
announcing
,
as
he
hastened
through
the
aisle
in
snow-white
apron
and
*NL*
jacket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
I
want
to
play
any
more
,
''
said
the
youngest
,
a
*NL*
black-haired
beauty
,
turned
supercilious
by
fortune
,
as
she
pushed
a
*NL*
euchre
hand
away
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
into
dinner
?
''
inquired
her
husband
,
who
was
all
that
fine
*NL*
raiment
can
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
not
yet
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
play
any
more
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jessica
,
''
said
her
mother
,
who
was
also
a
study
in
what
good
clothing
*NL*
can
do
for
age
,
``
push
that
pin
down
in
your
tie
--
it
's
coming
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jessica
obeyed
,
incidentally
touching
at
her
lovely
hair
and
looking
at
*NL*
a
little
jewel-faced
watch
.
Her
husband
studied
her
,
for
beauty
,
even
*NL*
cold
,
is
fascinating
from
one
point
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
wo
n't
have
much
more
of
this
weather
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
only
takes
*NL*
two
weeks
to
get
to
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Hurstwood
nestled
comfortably
in
her
corner
and
smiled
.
It
was
so
*NL*
nice
to
be
the
mother-in-law
of
a
rich
young
man
--
one
whose
financial
*NL*
state
had
borne
her
personal
inspection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
the
boat
will
sail
promptly
?
''
asked
Jessica
,
``
if
it
*NL*
keeps
up
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
''
answered
her
husband
.
``
This
wo
n't
make
any
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
down
the
aisle
came
a
very
fair-haired
banker
's
son
,
also
of
*NL*
Chicago
,
who
had
long
eyed
this
supercilious
beauty
.
Even
now
he
did
not
*NL*
hesitate
to
glance
at
her
,
and
she
was
conscious
of
it
.
With
a
specially
*NL*
conjured
show
of
indifference
,
she
turned
her
pretty
face
wholly
away
.
*NL*
It
was
not
wifely
modesty
at
all
.
By
so
much
was
her
pride
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Hurstwood
stood
before
a
dirty
four
story
building
in
a
*NL*
side
street
quite
near
the
Bowery
,
whose
one-time
coat
of
buff
had
been
*NL*
changed
by
soot
and
rain
.
He
mingled
with
a
crowd
of
men
--
a
crowd
which
*NL*
had
been
,
and
was
still
,
gathering
by
degrees
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
with
the
approach
of
two
or
three
,
who
hung
about
the
closed
*NL*
wooden
doors
and
beat
their
feet
to
keep
them
warm
.
They
had
on
faded
*NL*
derby
hats
with
dents
in
them
.
Their
misfit
coats
were
heavy
with
melted
*NL*
snow
and
turned
up
at
the
collars
.
Their
trousers
were
mere
bags
,
frayed
*NL*
at
the
bottom
and
wobbling
over
big
,
soppy
shoes
,
torn
at
the
sides
*NL*
and
worn
almost
to
shreds
.
They
made
no
effort
to
go
in
,
but
shifted
*NL*
ruefully
about
,
digging
their
hands
deep
in
their
pockets
and
leering
*NL*
at
the
crowd
and
the
increasing
lamps
.
With
the
minutes
,
increased
the
*NL*
number
.
There
were
old
men
with
grizzled
beards
and
sunken
eyes
,
men
*NL*
who
were
comparatively
young
but
shrunken
by
diseases
,
men
who
were
*NL*
middle-aged
.
None
were
fat
.
There
was
a
face
in
the
thick
of
the
*NL*
collection
which
was
as
white
as
drained
veal
.
There
was
another
red
as
*NL*
brick
.
Some
came
with
thin
,
rounded
shoulders
,
others
with
wooden
legs
,
*NL*
still
others
with
frames
so
lean
that
clothes
only
flapped
about
them
.
*NL*
There
were
great
ears
,
swollen
noses
,
thick
lips
,
and
,
above
all
,
red
,
*NL*
blood-shot
eyes
.
Not
a
normal
,
healthy
face
in
the
whole
mass
;
not
a
*NL*
straight
figure
;
not
a
straightforward
,
steady
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
drive
of
the
wind
and
sleet
they
pushed
in
on
one
another
.
There
*NL*
were
wrists
,
unprotected
by
coat
or
pocket
,
which
were
red
with
cold
.
*NL*
There
were
ears
,
half
covered
by
every
conceivable
semblance
of
a
hat
,
*NL*
which
still
looked
stiff
and
bitten
.
In
the
snow
they
shifted
,
now
one
*NL*
foot
,
now
another
,
almost
rocking
in
unison
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
growth
of
the
crowd
about
the
door
came
a
murmur
.
It
was
not
*NL*
conversation
,
but
a
running
comment
directed
at
any
one
in
general
.
It
*NL*
contained
oaths
and
slang
phrases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
damn
,
I
wish
they
'd
hurry
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
the
copper
watchin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
it
ai
n't
winter
,
nuther
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wisht
I
was
in
Sing
Sing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
a
sharper
lash
of
wind
cut
down
and
they
huddled
closer
.
It
was
an
*NL*
edging
,
shifting
,
pushing
throng
.
There
was
no
anger
,
no
pleading
,
no
*NL*
threatening
words
.
It
was
all
sullen
endurance
,
unlightened
by
either
*NL*
wit
or
good
fellowship
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
carriage
went
jingling
by
with
some
reclining
figure
in
it
.
One
of
the
*NL*
men
nearest
the
door
saw
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
the
bloke
ridin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ai
n't
so
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
eh
,
eh
!
''
yelled
another
,
the
carriage
having
long
since
passed
out
*NL*
of
hearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
the
night
crept
on
.
Along
the
walk
a
crowd
turned
*NL*
out
on
its
way
home
.
Men
and
shop-girls
went
by
with
quick
steps
.
The
*NL*
cross-town
cars
began
to
be
crowded
.
The
gas
lamps
were
blazing
,
and
*NL*
every
window
bloomed
ruddy
with
a
steady
flame
.
Still
the
crowd
hung
*NL*
about
the
door
,
unwavering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ai
n't
they
ever
goin
'
to
open
up
?
''
queried
a
hoarse
voice
,
*NL*
suggestively
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
to
renew
the
general
interest
in
the
closed
door
,
and
many
*NL*
gazed
in
that
direction
.
They
looked
at
it
as
dumb
brutes
look
,
as
dogs
*NL*
paw
and
whine
and
study
the
knob
.
They
shifted
and
blinked
and
muttered
,
*NL*
now
a
curse
,
now
a
comment
.
Still
they
waited
and
still
the
snow
whirled
*NL*
and
cut
them
with
biting
flakes
.
On
the
old
hats
and
peaked
shoulders
it
*NL*
was
piling
.
It
gathered
in
little
heaps
and
curves
and
no
one
brushed
*NL*
it
off
.
In
the
centre
of
the
crowd
the
warmth
and
steam
melted
it
,
and
*NL*
water
trickled
off
hat
rims
and
down
noses
,
which
the
owners
could
*NL*
not
reach
to
scratch
.
On
the
outer
rim
the
piles
remained
unmelted
.
*NL*
Hurstwood
,
who
could
not
get
in
the
centre
,
stood
with
head
lowered
to
*NL*
the
weather
and
bent
his
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
appeared
through
the
transom
overhead
.
It
sent
a
thrill
of
*NL*
possibility
through
the
watchers
.
There
was
a
murmur
of
recognition
.
At
*NL*
last
the
bars
grated
inside
and
the
crowd
pricked
up
its
ears
.
Footsteps
*NL*
shuffled
within
and
it
murmured
again
.
Some
one
called
:
``
Slow
up
there
,
*NL*
now
,
''
and
then
the
door
opened
.
It
was
push
and
jam
for
a
minute
,
with
*NL*
grim
,
beast
silence
to
prove
its
quality
,
and
then
it
melted
inward
,
*NL*
like
logs
floating
,
and
disappeared
.
There
were
wet
hats
and
wet
*NL*
shoulders
,
a
cold
,
shrunken
,
disgruntled
mass
,
pouring
in
between
bleak
*NL*
walls
.
It
was
just
six
o'clock
and
there
was
supper
in
every
hurrying
*NL*
pedestrian
's
face
.
And
yet
no
supper
was
provided
here
--
nothing
but
*NL*
beds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hurstwood
laid
down
his
fifteen
cents
and
crept
off
with
weary
steps
to
*NL*
his
allotted
room
.
It
was
a
dingy
affair
--
wooden
,
dusty
,
hard
.
A
small
*NL*
gas-jet
furnished
sufficient
light
for
so
rueful
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
!
''
he
said
,
clearing
his
throat
and
locking
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
he
began
leisurely
to
take
off
his
clothes
,
but
stopped
first
with
*NL*
his
coat
,
and
tucked
it
along
the
crack
under
the
door
.
His
vest
he
*NL*
arranged
in
the
same
place
.
His
old
wet
,
cracked
hat
he
laid
softly
upon
*NL*
the
table
.
Then
he
pulled
off
his
shoes
and
lay
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
he
thought
a
while
,
for
now
he
arose
and
turned
the
gas
*NL*
out
,
standing
calmly
in
the
blackness
,
hidden
from
view
.
After
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
in
which
he
reviewed
nothing
,
but
merely
hesitated
,
he
turned
*NL*
the
gas
on
again
,
but
applied
no
match
.
Even
then
he
stood
there
,
hidden
*NL*
wholly
in
that
kindness
which
is
night
,
while
the
uprising
fumes
filled
*NL*
the
room
.
When
the
odour
reached
his
nostrils
,
he
quit
his
attitude
and
*NL*
fumbled
for
the
bed
.
``
What
's
the
use
?
''
he
said
,
weakly
,
as
he
stretched
*NL*
himself
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
Carrie
had
attained
that
which
in
the
beginning
seemed
life
's
*NL*
object
,
or
,
at
least
,
such
fraction
of
it
as
human
beings
ever
attain
of
*NL*
their
original
desires
.
She
could
look
about
on
her
gowns
and
carriage
,
*NL*
her
furniture
and
bank
account
.
Friends
there
were
,
as
the
world
takes
*NL*
it
--
those
who
would
bow
and
smile
in
acknowledgment
of
her
success
.
For
*NL*
these
she
had
once
craved
.
Applause
there
was
,
and
publicity
--
once
far
*NL*
off
,
essential
things
,
but
now
grown
trivial
and
indifferent
.
*NL*
Beauty
also
--
her
type
of
loveliness
--
and
yet
she
was
lonely
.
In
her
*NL*
rocking-chair
she
sat
,
when
not
otherwise
engaged
--
singing
and
dreaming
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
in
life
there
is
ever
the
intellectual
and
the
emotional
*NL*
nature
--
the
mind
that
reasons
,
and
the
mind
that
feels
.
Of
one
come
*NL*
the
men
of
action
--
generals
and
statesmen
;
of
the
other
,
the
poets
and
*NL*
dreamers
--
artists
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
harps
in
the
wind
,
the
latter
respond
to
every
breath
of
fancy
,
*NL*
voicing
in
their
moods
all
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
ideal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Man
has
not
yet
comprehended
the
dreamer
any
more
than
he
has
the
*NL*
ideal
.
For
him
the
laws
and
morals
of
the
world
are
unduly
severe
.
*NL*
Ever
hearkening
to
the
sound
of
beauty
,
straining
for
the
flash
of
its
*NL*
distant
wings
,
he
watches
to
follow
,
wearying
his
feet
in
travelling
.
So
*NL*
watched
Carrie
,
so
followed
,
rocking
and
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
must
be
remembered
that
reason
had
little
part
in
this
.
Chicago
*NL*
dawning
,
she
saw
the
city
offering
more
of
loveliness
than
she
had
ever
*NL*
known
,
and
instinctively
,
by
force
of
her
moods
alone
,
clung
to
it
.
*NL*
In
fine
raiment
and
elegant
surroundings
,
men
seemed
to
be
contented
.
*NL*
Hence
,
she
drew
near
these
things
.
Chicago
,
New
York
;
Drouet
,
Hurstwood
;
*NL*
the
world
of
fashion
and
the
world
of
stage
--
these
were
but
incidents
.
*NL*
Not
them
,
but
that
which
they
represented
,
she
longed
for
.
Time
proved
*NL*
the
representation
false
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
the
tangle
of
human
life
!
How
dimly
as
yet
we
see
.
Here
was
Carrie
,
*NL*
in
the
beginning
poor
,
unsophisticated
,
emotional
;
responding
with
*NL*
desire
to
everything
most
lovely
in
life
,
yet
finding
herself
turned
as
*NL*
by
a
wall
.
Laws
to
say
:
``
Be
allured
,
if
you
will
,
by
everything
lovely
,
*NL*
but
draw
not
nigh
unless
by
righteousness
.
''
Convention
to
say
:
``
You
*NL*
shall
not
better
your
situation
save
by
honest
labour
.
''
If
honest
labour
*NL*
be
unremunerative
and
difficult
to
endure
;
if
it
be
the
long
,
long
road
*NL*
which
never
reaches
beauty
,
but
wearies
the
feet
and
the
heart
;
if
the
*NL*
drag
to
follow
beauty
be
such
that
one
abandons
the
admired
way
,
taking
*NL*
rather
the
despised
path
leading
to
her
dreams
quickly
,
who
shall
cast
*NL*
the
first
stone
?
Not
evil
,
but
longing
for
that
which
is
better
,
more
*NL*
often
directs
the
steps
of
the
erring
.
Not
evil
,
but
goodness
more
often
*NL*
allures
the
feeling
mind
unused
to
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
the
tinsel
and
shine
of
her
state
walked
Carrie
,
unhappy
.
As
when
*NL*
Drouet
took
her
,
she
had
thought
:
``
Now
I
am
lifted
into
that
which
is
*NL*
best
''
;
as
when
Hurstwood
seemingly
offered
her
the
better
way
:
``
Now
am
*NL*
I
happy
.
''
But
since
the
world
goes
its
way
past
all
who
will
not
partake
*NL*
of
its
folly
,
she
now
found
herself
alone
.
Her
purse
was
open
to
him
*NL*
whose
need
was
greatest
.
In
her
walks
on
Broadway
,
she
no
longer
thought
*NL*
of
the
elegance
of
the
creatures
who
passed
her
.
Had
they
more
of
that
*NL*
peace
and
beauty
which
glimmered
afar
off
,
then
were
they
to
be
envied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Drouet
abandoned
his
claim
and
was
seen
no
more
.
Of
Hurstwood
's
death
*NL*
she
was
not
even
aware
.
A
slow
,
black
boat
setting
out
from
the
pier
at
*NL*
Twenty-seventh
Street
upon
its
weekly
errand
bore
,
with
many
others
,
his
*NL*
nameless
body
to
the
Potter
's
Field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
passed
all
that
was
of
interest
concerning
these
twain
in
their
*NL*
relation
to
her
.
Their
influence
upon
her
life
is
explicable
alone
by
*NL*
the
nature
of
her
longings
.
Time
was
when
both
represented
for
her
*NL*
all
that
was
most
potent
in
earthly
success
.
They
were
the
personal
*NL*
representatives
of
a
state
most
blessed
to
attain
--
the
titled
*NL*
ambassadors
of
comfort
and
peace
,
aglow
with
their
credentials
.
It
is
*NL*
but
natural
that
when
the
world
which
they
represented
no
longer
allured
*NL*
her
,
its
ambassadors
should
be
discredited
.
Even
had
Hurstwood
returned
*NL*
in
his
original
beauty
and
glory
,
he
could
not
now
have
allured
her
.
*NL*
She
had
learned
that
in
his
world
,
as
in
her
own
present
state
,
was
not
*NL*
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
alone
,
she
was
now
an
illustration
of
the
devious
ways
by
which
*NL*
one
who
feels
,
rather
than
reasons
,
may
be
led
in
the
pursuit
of
beauty
.
*NL*
Though
often
disillusioned
,
she
was
still
waiting
for
that
halcyon
day
*NL*
when
she
would
be
led
forth
among
dreams
become
real
.
Ames
had
pointed
*NL*
out
a
farther
step
,
but
on
and
on
beyond
that
,
if
accomplished
,
would
*NL*
lie
others
for
her
.
It
was
forever
to
be
the
pursuit
of
that
radiance
of
*NL*
delight
which
tints
the
distant
hilltops
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
Carrie
,
Carrie
!
Oh
,
blind
strivings
of
the
human
heart
!
Onward
*NL*
onward
,
it
saith
,
and
where
beauty
leads
,
there
it
follows
.
Whether
it
*NL*
be
the
tinkle
of
a
lone
sheep
bell
o'er
some
quiet
landscape
,
or
the
*NL*
glimmer
of
beauty
in
sylvan
places
,
or
the
show
of
soul
in
some
passing
*NL*
eye
,
the
heart
knows
and
makes
answer
,
following
.
It
is
when
the
feet
*NL*
weary
and
hope
seems
vain
that
the
heartaches
and
the
longings
arise
.
*NL*
Know
,
then
,
that
for
you
is
neither
surfeit
nor
content
.
In
your
*NL*
rocking-chair
,
by
your
window
dreaming
,
shall
you
long
,
alone
.
In
your
*NL*
rocking-chair
,
by
your
window
,
shall
you
dream
such
happiness
as
you
may
*NL*
never
feel
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
