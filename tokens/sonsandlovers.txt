CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
THE
EARLY
MARRIED
LIFE
OF
THE
MORELS
*NL*
*NL*
``
THE
BOTTOMS
''
succeeded
to
``
Hell
Row
''
.
Hell
Row
was
a
block
of
thatched
,
*NL*
bulging
cottages
that
stood
by
the
brookside
on
Greenhill
Lane
.
There
*NL*
lived
the
colliers
who
worked
in
the
little
gin-pits
two
fields
away
.
*NL*
The
brook
ran
under
the
alder
trees
,
scarcely
soiled
by
these
small
*NL*
mines
,
whose
coal
was
drawn
to
the
surface
by
donkeys
that
plodded
*NL*
wearily
in
a
circle
round
a
gin
.
And
all
over
the
countryside
were
these
*NL*
same
pits
,
some
of
which
had
been
worked
in
the
time
of
Charles
II
,
the
*NL*
few
colliers
and
the
donkeys
burrowing
down
like
ants
into
the
earth
,
*NL*
making
queer
mounds
and
little
black
places
among
the
corn-fields
and
*NL*
the
meadows
.
And
the
cottages
of
these
coal-miners
,
in
blocks
and
pairs
*NL*
here
and
there
,
together
with
odd
farms
and
homes
of
the
stockingers
,
*NL*
straying
over
the
parish
,
formed
the
village
of
Bestwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
some
sixty
years
ago
,
a
sudden
change
took
place
,
gin-pits
were
*NL*
elbowed
aside
by
the
large
mines
of
the
financiers
.
The
coal
and
iron
*NL*
field
of
Nottinghamshire
and
Derbyshire
was
discovered
.
Carston
,
Waite
*NL*
and
Co.
appeared
.
Amid
tremendous
excitement
,
Lord
Palmerston
formally
*NL*
opened
the
company
's
first
mine
at
Spinney
Park
,
on
the
edge
of
Sherwood
*NL*
Forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
the
notorious
Hell
Row
,
which
through
growing
old
had
*NL*
acquired
an
evil
reputation
,
was
burned
down
,
and
much
dirt
was
cleansed
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carston
,
Waite
&
Co.
found
they
had
struck
on
a
good
thing
,
so
,
down
the
*NL*
valleys
of
the
brooks
from
Selby
and
Nuttall
,
new
mines
were
sunk
,
until
*NL*
soon
there
were
six
pits
working
.
From
Nuttall
,
high
up
on
the
sandstone
*NL*
among
the
woods
,
the
railway
ran
,
past
the
ruined
priory
of
the
*NL*
Carthusians
and
past
Robin
Hood
's
Well
,
down
to
Spinney
Park
,
then
on
to
*NL*
Minton
,
a
large
mine
among
corn-fields
;
from
Minton
across
the
farmlands
*NL*
of
the
valleyside
to
Bunker
's
Hill
,
branching
off
there
,
and
running
*NL*
north
to
Beggarlee
and
Selby
,
that
looks
over
at
Crich
and
the
hills
of
*NL*
Derbyshire
:
six
mines
like
black
studs
on
the
countryside
,
linked
by
a
*NL*
loop
of
fine
chain
,
the
railway
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
accommodate
the
regiments
of
miners
,
Carston
,
Waite
and
Co.
built
the
*NL*
Squares
,
great
quadrangles
of
dwellings
on
the
hillside
of
Bestwood
,
*NL*
and
then
,
in
the
brook
valley
,
on
the
site
of
Hell
Row
,
they
erected
the
*NL*
Bottoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bottoms
consisted
of
six
blocks
of
miners
'
dwellings
,
two
rows
*NL*
of
three
,
like
the
dots
on
a
blank-six
domino
,
and
twelve
houses
in
a
*NL*
block
.
This
double
row
of
dwellings
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
rather
sharp
*NL*
slope
from
Bestwood
,
and
looked
out
,
from
the
attic
windows
at
least
,
on
*NL*
the
slow
climb
of
the
valley
towards
Selby
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
houses
themselves
were
substantial
and
very
decent
.
One
could
walk
*NL*
all
round
,
seeing
little
front
gardens
with
auriculas
and
saxifrage
in
*NL*
the
shadow
of
the
bottom
block
,
sweet-williams
and
pinks
in
the
sunny
*NL*
top
block
;
seeing
neat
front
windows
,
little
porches
,
little
privet
*NL*
hedges
,
and
dormer
windows
for
the
attics
.
But
that
was
outside
;
that
*NL*
was
the
view
on
to
the
uninhabited
parlours
of
all
the
colliers
'
wives
.
*NL*
The
dwelling-room
,
the
kitchen
,
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
facing
*NL*
inward
between
the
blocks
,
looking
at
a
scrubby
back
garden
,
and
then
at
*NL*
the
ash-pits
.
And
between
the
rows
,
between
the
long
lines
of
ash-pits
,
*NL*
went
the
alley
,
where
the
children
played
and
the
women
gossiped
and
the
*NL*
men
smoked
.
So
,
the
actual
conditions
of
living
in
the
Bottoms
,
that
*NL*
was
so
well
built
and
that
looked
so
nice
,
were
quite
unsavoury
because
*NL*
people
must
live
in
the
kitchen
,
and
the
kitchens
opened
on
to
that
*NL*
nasty
alley
of
ash-pits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
was
not
anxious
to
move
into
the
Bottoms
,
which
was
already
*NL*
twelve
years
old
and
on
the
downward
path
,
when
she
descended
to
it
from
*NL*
Bestwood
.
But
it
was
the
best
she
could
do
.
Moreover
,
she
had
an
end
*NL*
house
in
one
of
the
top
blocks
,
and
thus
had
only
one
neighbour
;
on
*NL*
the
other
side
an
extra
strip
of
garden
.
And
,
having
an
end
house
,
she
*NL*
enjoyed
a
kind
of
aristocracy
among
the
other
women
of
the
``
between
''
*NL*
houses
,
because
her
rent
was
five
shillings
and
sixpence
instead
of
*NL*
five
shillings
a
week
.
But
this
superiority
in
station
was
not
much
*NL*
consolation
to
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
thirty-one
years
old
,
and
had
been
married
eight
years
.
A
rather
*NL*
small
woman
,
of
delicate
mould
but
resolute
bearing
,
she
shrank
a
little
*NL*
from
the
first
contact
with
the
Bottoms
women
.
She
came
down
in
the
*NL*
July
,
and
in
the
September
expected
her
third
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
was
a
miner
.
They
had
only
been
in
their
new
home
three
*NL*
weeks
when
the
wakes
,
or
fair
,
began
.
Morel
,
she
knew
,
was
sure
to
make
*NL*
a
holiday
of
it
.
He
went
off
early
on
the
Monday
morning
,
the
day
of
*NL*
the
fair
.
The
two
children
were
highly
excited
.
William
,
a
boy
of
seven
,
*NL*
fled
off
immediately
after
breakfast
,
to
prowl
round
the
wakes
ground
,
*NL*
leaving
Annie
,
who
was
only
five
,
to
whine
all
morning
to
go
also
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
did
her
work
.
She
scarcely
knew
her
neighbours
yet
,
and
knew
no
*NL*
one
with
whom
to
trust
the
little
girl
.
So
she
promised
to
take
her
to
*NL*
the
wakes
after
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
appeared
at
half-past
twelve
.
He
was
a
very
active
lad
,
*NL*
fair-haired
,
freckled
,
with
a
touch
of
the
Dane
or
Norwegian
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
have
my
dinner
,
mother
?
''
he
cried
,
rushing
in
with
his
cap
on
.
*NL*
''
'Cause
it
begins
at
half-past
one
,
the
man
says
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
have
your
dinner
as
soon
as
it
's
done
,
''
replied
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
done
?
''
he
cried
,
his
blue
eyes
staring
at
her
in
indignation
.
*NL*
``
Then
I
'm
goin
'
be-out
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
.
It
will
be
done
in
five
minutes
.
It
is
*NL*
only
half-past
twelve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
be
beginnin
'
,
''
the
boy
half
cried
,
half
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
die
if
they
do
,
''
said
the
mother
.
``
Besides
,
it
's
only
*NL*
half-past
twelve
,
so
you
've
a
full
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
began
hastily
to
lay
the
table
,
and
directly
the
three
sat
down
.
*NL*
They
were
eating
batter-pudding
and
jam
,
when
the
boy
jumped
off
his
*NL*
chair
and
stood
perfectly
stiff
.
Some
distance
away
could
be
heard
the
*NL*
first
small
braying
of
a
merry-go-round
,
and
the
tooting
of
a
horn
.
His
*NL*
face
quivered
as
he
looked
at
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
!
''
he
said
,
running
to
the
dresser
for
his
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
your
pudding
in
your
hand
--
and
it
's
only
five
past
one
,
so
you
*NL*
were
wrong
--
you
have
n't
got
your
twopence
,
''
cried
the
mother
in
a
*NL*
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
came
back
,
bitterly
disappointed
,
for
his
twopence
,
then
went
*NL*
off
without
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
go
,
I
want
to
go
,
''
said
Annie
,
beginning
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
you
shall
go
,
whining
,
wizzening
little
stick
!
''
said
the
*NL*
mother
.
And
later
in
the
afternoon
she
trudged
up
the
hill
under
the
*NL*
tall
hedge
with
her
child
.
The
hay
was
gathered
from
the
fields
,
and
*NL*
cattle
were
turned
on
to
the
eddish
.
It
was
warm
,
peaceful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
did
not
like
the
wakes
.
There
were
two
sets
of
horses
,
one
*NL*
going
by
steam
,
one
pulled
round
by
a
pony
;
three
organs
were
grinding
,
*NL*
and
there
came
odd
cracks
of
pistol-shots
,
fearful
screeching
of
the
*NL*
cocoanut
man
's
rattle
,
shouts
of
the
Aunt
Sally
man
,
screeches
from
the
*NL*
peep-show
lady
.
The
mother
perceived
her
son
gazing
enraptured
outside
*NL*
the
Lion
Wallace
booth
,
at
the
pictures
of
this
famous
lion
that
had
*NL*
killed
a
negro
and
maimed
for
life
two
white
men
.
She
left
him
alone
,
*NL*
and
went
to
get
Annie
a
spin
of
toffee
.
Presently
the
lad
stood
in
front
*NL*
of
her
,
wildly
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
said
you
was
coming
--
is
n't
the
'
a
lot
of
things
?
--
that
lion
's
*NL*
killed
three
men
--
I
've
spent
my
tuppence
--
an
'
look
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
from
his
pocket
two
egg-cups
,
with
pink
moss-roses
on
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
these
from
that
stall
where
y'
ave
ter
get
them
marbles
in
*NL*
them
holes
.
An
'
I
got
these
two
in
two
goes
-
`
aepenny
a
go-they
've
got
*NL*
moss-roses
on
,
look
here
.
I
wanted
these
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
he
wanted
them
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
she
said
,
pleased
.
``
They
ARE
pretty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
carry
'em
,
'cause
I
'm
frightened
o
'
breakin
'
'em
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
tipful
of
excitement
now
she
had
come
,
led
her
about
the
ground
,
*NL*
showed
her
everything
.
Then
,
at
the
peep-show
,
she
explained
the
*NL*
pictures
,
in
a
sort
of
story
,
to
which
he
listened
as
if
spellbound
.
He
*NL*
would
not
leave
her
.
All
the
time
he
stuck
close
to
her
,
bristling
with
*NL*
a
small
boy
's
pride
of
her
.
For
no
other
woman
looked
such
a
lady
as
she
*NL*
did
,
in
her
little
black
bonnet
and
her
cloak
.
She
smiled
when
she
saw
*NL*
women
she
knew
.
When
she
was
tired
she
said
to
her
son
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
you
coming
now
,
or
later
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
goin
'
a
`
ready
?
''
he
cried
,
his
face
full
of
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Already
?
It
is
past
four
,
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
goin
'
a
`
ready
for
?
''
he
lamented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
come
if
you
do
n't
want
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
went
slowly
away
with
her
little
girl
,
whilst
her
son
stood
*NL*
watching
her
,
cut
to
the
heart
to
let
her
go
,
and
yet
unable
to
leave
*NL*
the
wakes
.
As
she
crossed
the
open
ground
in
front
of
the
Moon
and
Stars
*NL*
she
heard
men
shouting
,
and
smelled
the
beer
,
and
hurried
a
little
,
*NL*
thinking
her
husband
was
probably
in
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
half-past
six
her
son
came
home
,
tired
now
,
rather
pale
,
and
*NL*
somewhat
wretched
.
He
was
miserable
,
though
he
did
not
know
it
,
because
*NL*
he
had
let
her
go
alone
.
Since
she
had
gone
,
he
had
not
enjoyed
his
*NL*
wakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
my
dad
been
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
helping
to
wait
at
the
Moon
and
Stars
.
I
seed
him
through
that
*NL*
black
tin
stuff
wi
'
holes
in
,
on
the
window
,
wi
'
his
sleeves
rolled
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
exclaimed
the
mother
shortly
.
``
He
's
got
no
money
.
An
'
he
'll
be
*NL*
satisfied
if
he
gets
his
`
lowance
,
whether
they
give
him
more
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
light
was
fading
,
and
Mrs.
Morel
could
see
no
more
to
sew
,
she
*NL*
rose
and
went
to
the
door
.
Everywhere
was
the
sound
of
excitement
,
the
*NL*
restlessness
of
the
holiday
,
that
at
last
infected
her
.
She
went
*NL*
out
into
the
side
garden
.
Women
were
coming
home
from
the
wakes
,
the
*NL*
children
hugging
a
white
lamb
with
green
legs
,
or
a
wooden
horse
.
*NL*
Occasionally
a
man
lurched
past
,
almost
as
full
as
he
could
carry
.
*NL*
Sometimes
a
good
husband
came
along
with
his
family
,
peacefully
.
But
*NL*
usually
the
women
and
children
were
alone
.
The
stay-at-home
mothers
*NL*
stood
gossiping
at
the
corners
of
the
alley
,
as
the
twilight
sank
,
*NL*
folding
their
arms
under
their
white
aprons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
was
alone
,
but
she
was
used
to
it
.
Her
son
and
her
little
*NL*
girl
slept
upstairs
;
so
,
it
seemed
,
her
home
was
there
behind
her
,
*NL*
fixed
and
stable
.
But
she
felt
wretched
with
the
coming
child
.
The
world
*NL*
seemed
a
dreary
place
,
where
nothing
else
would
happen
for
her
--
at
*NL*
least
until
William
grew
up
.
But
for
herself
,
nothing
but
this
dreary
*NL*
endurance
--
till
the
children
grew
up
.
And
the
children
!
She
could
not
*NL*
afford
to
have
this
third
.
She
did
not
want
it
.
The
father
was
serving
*NL*
beer
in
a
public
house
,
swilling
himself
drunk
.
She
despised
him
,
and
*NL*
was
tied
to
him
.
This
coming
child
was
too
much
for
her
.
If
it
were
not
*NL*
for
William
and
Annie
,
she
was
sick
of
it
,
the
struggle
with
poverty
and
*NL*
ugliness
and
meanness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
into
the
front
garden
,
feeling
too
heavy
to
take
herself
out
,
*NL*
yet
unable
to
stay
indoors
.
The
heat
suffocated
her
.
And
looking
ahead
,
*NL*
the
prospect
of
her
life
made
her
feel
as
if
she
were
buried
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
front
garden
was
a
small
square
with
a
privet
hedge
.
There
she
*NL*
stood
,
trying
to
soothe
herself
with
the
scent
of
flowers
and
the
*NL*
fading
,
beautiful
evening
.
Opposite
her
small
gate
was
the
stile
that
*NL*
led
uphill
,
under
the
tall
hedge
between
the
burning
glow
of
the
cut
*NL*
pastures
.
The
sky
overhead
throbbed
and
pulsed
with
light
.
The
glow
sank
*NL*
quickly
off
the
field
;
the
earth
and
the
hedges
smoked
dusk
.
As
it
grew
*NL*
dark
,
a
ruddy
glare
came
out
on
the
hilltop
,
and
out
of
the
glare
the
*NL*
diminished
commotion
of
the
fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
down
the
trough
of
darkness
formed
by
the
path
under
the
*NL*
hedges
,
men
came
lurching
home
.
One
young
man
lapsed
into
a
run
down
*NL*
the
steep
bit
that
ended
the
hill
,
and
went
with
a
crash
into
the
stile
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
shuddered
.
He
picked
himself
up
,
swearing
viciously
,
rather
*NL*
pathetically
,
as
if
he
thought
the
stile
had
wanted
to
hurt
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
indoors
,
wondering
if
things
were
never
going
to
alter
.
She
was
*NL*
beginning
by
now
to
realise
that
they
would
not
.
She
seemed
so
far
*NL*
away
from
her
girlhood
,
she
wondered
if
it
were
the
same
person
walking
*NL*
heavily
up
the
back
garden
at
the
Bottoms
as
had
run
so
lightly
up
the
*NL*
breakwater
at
Sheerness
ten
years
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
I
to
do
with
it
?
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
What
have
I
to
do
*NL*
with
all
this
?
Even
the
child
I
am
going
to
have
!
It
does
n't
seem
as
if
*NL*
I
were
taken
into
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
life
takes
hold
of
one
,
carries
the
body
along
,
accomplishes
*NL*
one
's
history
,
and
yet
is
not
real
,
but
leaves
oneself
as
it
were
*NL*
slurred
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wait
,
''
Mrs.
Morel
said
to
herself
--
``
I
wait
,
and
what
I
wait
for
can
*NL*
never
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
straightened
the
kitchen
,
lit
the
lamp
,
mended
the
fire
,
looked
*NL*
out
the
washing
for
the
next
day
,
and
put
it
to
soak
.
After
which
*NL*
she
sat
down
to
her
sewing
.
Through
the
long
hours
her
needle
flashed
*NL*
regularly
through
the
stuff
.
Occasionally
she
sighed
,
moving
to
relieve
*NL*
herself
.
And
all
the
time
she
was
thinking
how
to
make
the
most
of
what
*NL*
she
had
,
for
the
children
's
sakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
eleven
her
husband
came
.
His
cheeks
were
very
red
and
*NL*
very
shiny
above
his
black
moustache
.
His
head
nodded
slightly
.
He
was
*NL*
pleased
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

she
said
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

His
voice
went

.
``

He
laid
the
*NL*
gingerbread

the
cocoanut
,
a
hairy
object
,
on
the
table
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
As
a
compromise
,
she
picked
up
the
cocoanut
and
shook
it
,
to
see
if
it
*NL*
had
any
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*

said
*NL*
Morel
.
He
was
extraordinarily
pleased
with
himself
,
because
of
his
day
's
*NL*
helping
to
wait
in
the
Moon
and
Stars
.
He
chattered
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
,
very
tired
,
and
sick
of
his
babble
,
went
to
bed
as
quickly
*NL*
as
possible
,
while
he
raked
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
came
of
a
good
old
burgher
family
,
famous
independents
*NL*
who
had
fought
with
Colonel
Hutchinson
,
and
who
remained
stout
*NL*
Congregationalists
.
Her
grandfather
had
gone
bankrupt
in
the
lace-market
*NL*
at
a
time
when
so
many
lace-manufacturers
were
ruined
in
Nottingham
.
Her
*NL*
father
,
George
Coppard
,
was
an
engineer
--
a
large
,
handsome
,
haughty
*NL*
man
,
proud
of
his
fair
skin
and
blue
eyes
,
but
more
proud
still
of
his
*NL*
integrity
.
Gertrude
resembled
her
mother
in
her
small
build
.
But
her
*NL*
temper
,
proud
and
unyielding
,
she
had
from
the
Coppards
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Coppard
was
bitterly
galled
by
his
own
poverty
.
He
became
foreman
*NL*
of
the
engineers
in
the
dockyard
at
Sheerness
.
Mrs.
Morel
--
Gertrude
--
was
*NL*
the
second
daughter
.
She
favoured
her
mother
,
loved
her
mother
best
of
*NL*
all
;
but
she
had
the
Coppards
'
clear
,
defiant
blue
eyes
and
their
broad
*NL*
brow
.
She
remembered
to
have
hated
her
father
's
overbearing
manner
*NL*
towards
her
gentle
,
humorous
,
kindly-souled
mother
.
She
remembered
*NL*
running
over
the
breakwater
at
Sheerness
and
finding
the
boat
.
She
*NL*
remembered
to
have
been
petted
and
flattered
by
all
the
men
when
she
had
*NL*
gone
to
the
dockyard
,
for
she
was
a
delicate
,
rather
proud
child
.
She
*NL*
remembered
the
funny
old
mistress
,
whose
assistant
she
had
become
,
whom
*NL*
she
had
loved
to
help
in
the
private
school
.
And
she
still
had
the
Bible
*NL*
that
John
Field
had
given
her
.
She
used
to
walk
home
from
chapel
*NL*
with
John
Field
when
she
was
nineteen
.
He
was
the
son
of
a
well-to-do
*NL*
tradesman
,
had
been
to
college
in
London
,
and
was
to
devote
himself
to
*NL*
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
always
recall
in
detail
a
September
Sunday
afternoon
,
when
*NL*
they
had
sat
under
the
vine
at
the
back
of
her
father
's
house
.
The
sun
*NL*
came
through
the
chinks
of
the
vine-leaves
and
made
beautiful
patterns
,
*NL*
like
a
lace
scarf
,
falling
on
her
and
on
him
.
Some
of
the
leaves
were
*NL*
clean
yellow
,
like
yellow
flat
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
sit
still
,
''
he
had
cried
.
``
Now
your
hair
,
I
do
n't
know
what
it
IS
*NL*
like
!
It
's
as
bright
as
copper
and
gold
,
as
red
as
burnt
copper
,
and
*NL*
it
has
gold
threads
where
the
sun
shines
on
it
.
Fancy
their
saying
it
's
*NL*
brown
.
Your
mother
calls
it
mouse-colour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
met
his
brilliant
eyes
,
but
her
clear
face
scarcely
showed
the
*NL*
elation
which
rose
within
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
say
you
do
n't
like
business
,
''
she
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
.
I
hate
it
!
''
he
cried
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
would
like
to
go
into
the
ministry
,
''
she
half
implored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
.
I
should
love
it
,
if
I
thought
I
could
make
a
first-rate
*NL*
preacher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
n't
you
--
why
DO
N'T
you
?
''
Her
voice
rang
with
defiance
.
``
If
I
*NL*
were
a
man
,
nothing
would
stop
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
her
head
erect
.
He
was
rather
timid
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
my
father
's
so
stiff-necked
.
He
means
to
put
me
into
the
business
,
*NL*
and
I
know
he
'll
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you
're
a
MAN
?
''
she
had
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
a
man
is
n't
everything
,
''
he
replied
,
frowning
with
puzzled
*NL*
helplessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
she
moved
about
her
work
at
the
Bottoms
,
with
some
experience
of
*NL*
what
being
a
man
meant
,
she
knew
that
it
was
NOT
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
twenty
,
owing
to
her
health
,
she
had
left
Sheerness
.
Her
father
had
*NL*
retired
home
to
Nottingham
.
John
Field
's
father
had
been
ruined
;
the
*NL*
son
had
gone
as
a
teacher
in
Norwood
.
She
did
not
hear
of
him
until
,
two
*NL*
years
later
,
she
made
determined
inquiry
.
He
had
married
his
landlady
,
a
*NL*
woman
of
forty
,
a
widow
with
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
still
Mrs.
Morel
preserved
John
Field
's
Bible
.
She
did
not
now
*NL*
believe
him
to
be
--
Well
,
she
understood
pretty
well
what
he
might
or
*NL*
might
not
have
been
.
So
she
preserved
his
Bible
,
and
kept
his
memory
*NL*
intact
in
her
heart
,
for
her
own
sake
.
To
her
dying
day
,
for
thirty-five
*NL*
years
,
she
did
not
speak
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
twenty-three
years
old
,
she
met
,
at
a
Christmas
party
,
a
*NL*
young
man
from
the
Erewash
Valley
.
Morel
was
then
twenty-seven
years
*NL*
old
.
He
was
well
set-up
,
erect
,
and
very
smart
.
He
had
wavy
black
hair
*NL*
that
shone
again
,
and
a
vigorous
black
beard
that
had
never
been
shaved
.
*NL*
His
cheeks
were
ruddy
,
and
his
red
,
moist
mouth
was
noticeable
because
*NL*
he
laughed
so
often
and
so
heartily
.
He
had
that
rare
thing
,
a
rich
,
*NL*
ringing
laugh
.
Gertrude
Coppard
had
watched
him
,
fascinated
.
He
was
*NL*
so
full
of
colour
and
animation
,
his
voice
ran
so
easily
into
comic
*NL*
grotesque
,
he
was
so
ready
and
so
pleasant
with
everybody
.
Her
own
*NL*
father
had
a
rich
fund
of
humour
,
but
it
was
satiric
.
This
man
's
was
*NL*
different
:
soft
,
non-intellectual
,
warm
,
a
kind
of
gambolling
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
herself
was
opposite
.
She
had
a
curious
,
receptive
mind
which
found
*NL*
much
pleasure
and
amusement
in
listening
to
other
folk
.
She
was
clever
*NL*
in
leading
folk
to
talk
.
She
loved
ideas
,
and
was
considered
very
*NL*
intellectual
.
What
she
liked
most
of
all
was
an
argument
on
religion
or
*NL*
philosophy
or
politics
with
some
educated
man
.
This
she
did
not
often
*NL*
enjoy
.
So
she
always
had
people
tell
her
about
themselves
,
finding
her
*NL*
pleasure
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
person
she
was
rather
small
and
delicate
,
with
a
large
brow
,
and
*NL*
dropping
bunches
of
brown
silk
curls
.
Her
blue
eyes
were
very
straight
,
*NL*
honest
,
and
searching
.
She
had
the
beautiful
hands
of
the
Coppards
.
*NL*
Her
dress
was
always
subdued
.
She
wore
dark
blue
silk
,
with
a
peculiar
*NL*
silver
chain
of
silver
scallops
.
This
,
and
a
heavy
brooch
of
twisted
*NL*
gold
,
was
her
only
ornament
.
She
was
still
perfectly
intact
,
deeply
*NL*
religious
,
and
full
of
beautiful
candour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walter
Morel
seemed
melted
away
before
her
.
She
was
to
the
miner
that
*NL*
thing
of
mystery
and
fascination
,
a
lady
.
When
she
spoke
to
him
,
it
was
*NL*
with
a
southern
pronunciation
and
a
purity
of
English
which
thrilled
*NL*
him
to
hear
.
She
watched
him
.
He
danced
well
,
as
if
it
were
natural
and
*NL*
joyous
in
him
to
dance
.
His
grandfather
was
a
French
refugee
who
had
*NL*
married
an
English
barmaid
--
if
it
had
been
a
marriage
.
Gertrude
Coppard
*NL*
watched
the
young
miner
as
he
danced
,
a
certain
subtle
exultation
like
*NL*
glamour
in
his
movement
,
and
his
face
the
flower
of
his
body
,
ruddy
,
*NL*
with
tumbled
black
hair
,
and
laughing
alike
whatever
partner
he
bowed
*NL*
above
.
She
thought
him
rather
wonderful
,
never
having
met
anyone
like
*NL*
him
.
Her
father
was
to
her
the
type
of
all
men
.
And
George
Coppard
,
*NL*
proud
in
his
bearing
,
handsome
,
and
rather
bitter
;
who
preferred
*NL*
theology
in
reading
,
and
who
drew
near
in
sympathy
only
to
one
man
,
the
*NL*
Apostle
Paul
;
who
was
harsh
in
government
,
and
in
familiarity
ironic
;
*NL*
who
ignored
all
sensuous
pleasure
:
--
he
was
very
different
from
the
*NL*
miner
.
Gertrude
herself
was
rather
contemptuous
of
dancing
;
she
had
not
*NL*
the
slightest
inclination
towards
that
accomplishment
,
and
had
never
*NL*
learned
even
a
Roger
de
Coverley
.
She
was
puritan
,
like
her
father
,
*NL*
high-minded
,
and
really
stern
.
Therefore
the
dusky
,
golden
softness
of
*NL*
this
man
's
sensuous
flame
of
life
,
that
flowed
off
his
flesh
like
the
*NL*
flame
from
a
candle
,
not
baffled
and
gripped
into
incandescence
by
*NL*
thought
and
spirit
as
her
life
was
,
seemed
to
her
something
wonderful
,
*NL*
beyond
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
and
bowed
above
her
.
A
warmth
radiated
through
her
as
if
she
had
*NL*
drunk
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
do
come
and
have
this
one
wi
'
me
,
''
he
said
caressively
.
``
It
's
easy
,
*NL*
you
know
.
I
'm
pining
to
see
you
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
told
him
before
she
could
not
dance
.
She
glanced
at
his
humility
*NL*
and
smiled
.
Her
smile
was
very
beautiful
.
It
moved
the
man
so
that
he
*NL*
forgot
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
dance
,
''
she
said
softly
.
Her
words
came
clean
and
ringing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
--
he
often
did
the
right
thing
by
*NL*
instinct
--
he
sat
beside
her
,
inclining
reverentially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
n't
miss
your
dance
,
''
she
reproved
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
I
do
n't
want
to
dance
that
--
it
's
not
one
as
I
care
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
invited
me
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
very
heartily
at
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
thought
o
'
that
.
Tha
`
rt
not
long
in
taking
the
curl
out
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
her
turn
to
laugh
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
look
as
if
you
'd
come
much
uncurled
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
like
a
pig
's
tail
,
I
curl
because
I
canna
help
it
,
''
he
laughed
,
*NL*
rather
boisterously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
a
miner
!
''
she
exclaimed
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
went
down
when
I
was
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
in
wondering
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
were
ten
!
And
was
n't
it
very
hard
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
soon
get
used
to
it
.
You
live
like
th
'
mice
,
an
'
you
pop
out
at
*NL*
night
to
see
what
's
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes
me
feel
blind
,
''
she
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
a
moudiwarp
!
''
he
laughed
.
``
Yi
,
an
'
there
's
some
chaps
as
does
*NL*
go
round
like
moudiwarps
.
''
He
thrust
his
face
forward
in
the
blind
,
*NL*
snout-like
way
of
a
mole
,
seeming
to
sniff
and
peer
for
direction
.
``
They
*NL*
dun
though
!
''
he
protested
naively
.
``
Tha
niver
seed
such
a
way
they
get
*NL*
in
.
But
tha
mun
let
me
ta'e
thee
down
some
time
,
an
'
tha
can
see
for
*NL*
thysen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
startled
.
This
was
a
new
tract
of
life
suddenly
*NL*
opened
before
her
.
She
realised
the
life
of
the
miners
,
hundreds
of
them
*NL*
toiling
below
earth
and
coming
up
at
evening
.
He
seemed
to
her
noble
.
He
*NL*
risked
his
life
daily
,
and
with
gaiety
.
She
looked
at
him
,
with
a
touch
*NL*
of
appeal
in
her
pure
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
n't
ter
like
it
?
''
he
asked
tenderly
.
''
`
Appen
not
,
it
`
ud
dirty
*NL*
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
never
been
``
thee
'd
''
and
``
thou
'd
''
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
Christmas
they
were
married
,
and
for
three
months
she
was
*NL*
perfectly
happy
:
for
six
months
she
was
very
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
signed
the
pledge
,
and
wore
the
blue
ribbon
of
a
tee-totaller
:
he
*NL*
was
nothing
if
not
showy
.
They
lived
,
she
thought
,
in
his
own
house
.
*NL*
It
was
small
,
but
convenient
enough
,
and
quite
nicely
furnished
,
*NL*
with
solid
,
worthy
stuff
that
suited
her
honest
soul
.
The
women
,
her
*NL*
neighbours
,
were
rather
foreign
to
her
,
and
Morel
's
mother
and
sisters
*NL*
were
apt
to
sneer
at
her
ladylike
ways
.
But
she
could
perfectly
well
*NL*
live
by
herself
,
so
long
as
she
had
her
husband
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
when
she
herself
wearied
of
love-talk
,
she
tried
to
open
her
*NL*
heart
seriously
to
him
.
She
saw
him
listen
deferentially
,
but
without
*NL*
understanding
.
This
killed
her
efforts
at
a
finer
intimacy
,
and
she
had
*NL*
flashes
of
fear
.
Sometimes
he
was
restless
of
an
evening
:
it
was
not
*NL*
enough
for
him
just
to
be
near
her
,
she
realised
.
She
was
glad
when
he
*NL*
set
himself
to
little
jobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
remarkably
handy
man
--
could
make
or
mend
anything
.
So
she
would
*NL*
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
like
that
coal-rake
of
your
mother
's
--
it
is
small
and
natty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
ter
,
my
wench
?
Well
,
I
made
that
,
so
I
can
make
thee
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
why
,
it
's
a
steel
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
what
if
it
is
!
Tha
s
`
lt
ha'e
one
very
similar
,
if
not
exactly
*NL*
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
mind
the
mess
,
nor
the
hammering
and
noise
.
He
was
busy
and
*NL*
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
seventh
month
,
when
she
was
brushing
his
Sunday
coat
,
she
*NL*
felt
papers
in
the
breast
pocket
,
and
,
seized
with
a
sudden
curiosity
,
*NL*
took
them
out
to
read
.
He
very
rarely
wore
the
frock-coat
he
was
married
*NL*
in
:
and
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
before
to
feel
curious
concerning
the
*NL*
papers
.
They
were
the
bills
of
the
household
furniture
,
still
unpaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
''
she
said
at
night
,
after
he
was
washed
and
had
had
his
*NL*
dinner
.
``
I
found
these
in
the
pocket
of
your
wedding-coat
.
Have
n't
you
*NL*
settled
the
bills
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
have
n't
had
a
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
told
me
all
was
paid
.
I
had
better
go
into
Nottingham
on
*NL*
Saturday
and
settle
them
.
I
do
n't
like
sitting
on
another
man
's
chairs
*NL*
and
eating
from
an
unpaid
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
have
your
bank-book
,
ca
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
can
ha'e
it
,
for
what
good
it
'll
be
to
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
--
''
she
began
.
He
had
told
her
he
had
a
good
bit
of
money
left
*NL*
over
.
But
she
realised
it
was
no
use
asking
questions
.
She
sat
rigid
*NL*
with
bitterness
and
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
she
went
down
to
see
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
you
buy
the
furniture
for
Walter
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
,
''
tartly
retorted
the
elder
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
did
he
give
you
to
pay
for
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
woman
was
stung
with
fine
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eighty
pound
,
if
you
're
so
keen
on
knowin
'
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eighty
pounds
!
But
there
are
forty-two
pounds
still
owing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
where
has
it
all
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
find
all
the
papers
,
I
think
,
if
you
look
--
beside
ten
pound
as
*NL*
he
owed
me
,
an
'
six
pound
as
the
wedding
cost
down
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
pounds
!
''
echoed
Gertrude
Morel
.
It
seemed
to
her
monstrous
that
,
*NL*
after
her
own
father
had
paid
so
heavily
for
her
wedding
,
six
pounds
*NL*
more
should
have
been
squandered
in
eating
and
drinking
at
Walter
's
*NL*
parents
'
house
,
at
his
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
has
he
sunk
in
his
houses
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
houses
--
which
houses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gertrude
Morel
went
white
to
the
lips
.
He
had
told
her
the
house
he
*NL*
lived
in
,
and
the
next
one
,
was
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
the
house
we
live
in
--
''
she
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
my
houses
,
those
two
,
''
said
the
mother-in-law
.
``
And
not
clear
*NL*
either
.
It
's
as
much
as
I
can
do
to
keep
the
mortgage
interest
paid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gertrude
sat
white
and
silent
.
She
was
her
father
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
ought
to
be
paying
you
rent
,
''
she
said
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walter
is
paying
me
rent
,
''
replied
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
rent
?
''
asked
Gertrude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
and
six
a
week
,
''
retorted
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
more
than
the
house
was
worth
.
Gertrude
held
her
head
erect
,
*NL*
looked
straight
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
lucky
to
be
you
,
''
said
the
elder
woman
,
bitingly
,
``
to
have
a
*NL*
husband
as
takes
all
the
worry
of
the
money
,
and
leaves
you
a
free
*NL*
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
wife
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
very
little
to
her
husband
,
but
her
manner
had
changed
towards
*NL*
him
.
Something
in
her
proud
,
honourable
soul
had
crystallised
out
hard
*NL*
as
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
October
came
in
,
she
thought
only
of
Christmas
.
Two
years
ago
,
at
*NL*
Christmas
,
she
had
met
him
.
Last
Christmas
she
had
married
him
.
This
*NL*
Christmas
she
would
bear
him
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
dance
yourself
,
do
you
,
missis
?
''
asked
her
nearest
neighbour
,
*NL*
in
October
,
when
there
was
great
talk
of
opening
a
dancing-class
over
*NL*
the
Brick
and
Tile
Inn
at
Bestwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
never
had
the
least
inclination
to
,
''
Mrs.
Morel
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fancy
!
An
'
how
funny
as
you
should
ha
'
married
your
Mester
.
You
know
*NL*
he
's
quite
a
famous
one
for
dancing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
he
was
famous
,
''
laughed
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yea
,
he
is
though
!
Why
,
he
ran
that
dancing-class
in
the
Miners
'
Arms
*NL*
club-room
for
over
five
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
did
.
''
The
other
woman
was
defiant
.
``
An
'
it
was
thronged
*NL*
every
Tuesday
,
and
Thursday
,
an

Sat

day

there

on

*NL*
accordin

to
all
accounts

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
kind
of
thing
was
gall
and
bitterness
to
Mrs.
Morel
,
and
she
had
*NL*
a
fair
share
of
it
.
The
women
did
not
spare
her
,
at
first
;
for
she
was
*NL*
superior
,
though
she
could
not
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
be
rather
late
in
coming
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
working
very
late
now
,
are
n't
they
?
''
she
said
to
her
*NL*
washer-woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
later
than
they
allers
do
,
I
do
n't
think

But
they
stop
to
have
*NL*
their
pint
at
Ellen

they

an

Dinner

stone
cold

an

it
serves

right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mr.
Morel
does
not
take
any
drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
dropped
the
clothes
,
looked
at
Mrs.
Morel
,
then
went
on
with
*NL*
her
work
,
saying
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gertrude
Morel
was
very
ill
when
the
boy
was
born
.
Morel
was
good
to
*NL*
her
,
as
good
as
gold
.
But
she
felt
very
lonely
,
miles
away
from
her
own
*NL*
people
.
She
felt
lonely
with
him
now
,
and
his
presence
only
made
it
more
*NL*
intense
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
was
small
and
frail
at
first
,
but
he
came
on
quickly
.
He
was
*NL*
a
beautiful
child
,
with
dark
gold
ringlets
,
and
dark-blue
eyes
which
*NL*
changed
gradually
to
a
clear
grey
.
His
mother
loved
him
passionately
.
*NL*
He
came
just
when
her
own
bitterness
of
disillusion
was
hardest
to
bear
;
*NL*
when
her
faith
in
life
was
shaken
,
and
her
soul
felt
dreary
and
lonely
.
*NL*
She
made
much
of
the
child
,
and
the
father
was
jealous
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Mrs.
Morel
despised
her
husband
.
She
turned
to
the
child
;
she
*NL*
turned
from
the
father
.
He
had
begun
to
neglect
her
;
the
novelty
of
his
*NL*
own
home
was
gone
.
He
had
no
grit
,
she
said
bitterly
to
herself
.
What
*NL*
he
felt
just
at
the
minute
,
that
was
all
to
him
.
He
could
not
abide
by
*NL*
anything
.
There
was
nothing
at
the
back
of
all
his
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
began
a
battle
between
the
husband
and
wife
--
a
fearful
,
bloody
*NL*
battle
that
ended
only
with
the
death
of
one
.
She
fought
to
make
him
*NL*
undertake
his
own
responsibilities
,
to
make
him
fulfill
his
obligations
.
*NL*
But
he
was
too
different
from
her
.
His
nature
was
purely
sensuous
,
and
*NL*
she
strove
to
make
him
moral
,
religious
.
She
tried
to
force
him
to
face
*NL*
things
.
He
could
not
endure
it
--
it
drove
him
out
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
baby
was
still
tiny
,
the
father
's
temper
had
become
so
*NL*
irritable
that
it
was
not
to
be
trusted
.
The
child
had
only
to
give
a
*NL*
little
trouble
when
the
man
began
to
bully
.
A
little
more
,
and
the
hard
*NL*
hands
of
the
collier
hit
the
baby
.
Then
Mrs.
Morel
loathed
her
husband
,
*NL*
loathed
him
for
days
;
and
he
went
out
and
drank
;
and
she
cared
very
*NL*
little
what
he
did
.
Only
,
on
his
return
,
she
scathed
him
with
her
*NL*
satire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
estrangement
between
them
caused
him
,
knowingly
or
unknowingly
,
*NL*
grossly
to
offend
her
where
he
would
not
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
was
only
one
year
old
,
and
his
mother
was
proud
of
him
,
he
was
*NL*
so
pretty
.
She
was
not
well
off
now
,
but
her
sisters
kept
the
boy
in
*NL*
clothes
.
Then
,
with
his
little
white
hat
curled
with
an
ostrich
feather
,
*NL*
and
his
white
coat
,
he
was
a
joy
to
her
,
the
twining
wisps
of
hair
*NL*
clustering
round
his
head
.
Mrs.
Morel
lay
listening
,
one
Sunday
morning
,
*NL*
to
the
chatter
of
the
father
and
child
downstairs
.
Then
she
dozed
off
.
*NL*
When
she
came
downstairs
,
a
great
fire
glowed
in
the
grate
,
the
room
was
*NL*
hot
,
the
breakfast
was
roughly
laid
,
and
seated
in
his
armchair
,
against
*NL*
the
chimney-piece
,
sat
Morel
,
rather
timid
;
and
standing
between
*NL*
his
legs
,
the
child
--
cropped
like
a
sheep
,
with
such
an
odd
round
*NL*
poll
--
looking
wondering
at
her
;
and
on
a
newspaper
spread
out
upon
*NL*
the
hearthrug
,
a
myriad
of
crescent-shaped
curls
,
like
the
petals
of
a
*NL*
marigold
scattered
in
the
reddening
firelight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
stood
still
.
It
was
her
first
baby
.
She
went
very
white
,
and
*NL*
was
unable
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dost
think
o
'
`
im
?
''
Morel
laughed
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gripped
her
two
fists
,
lifted
them
,
and
came
forward
.
Morel
shrank
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
kill
you
,
I
could
!
''
she
said
.
She
choked
with
rage
,
her
two
*NL*
fists
uplifted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yer
non
want
ter
make
a
wench
on
`
im
,
''
Morel
said
,
in
a
frightened
*NL*
tone
,
bending
his
head
to
shield
his
eyes
from
hers
.
His
attempt
at
*NL*
laughter
had
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
looked
down
at
the
jagged
,
close-clipped
head
of
her
child
.
*NL*
She
put
her
hands
on
his
hair
,
and
stroked
and
fondled
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
my
boy
!
''
she
faltered
.
Her
lip
trembled
,
her
face
broke
,
and
,
*NL*
snatching
up
the
child
,
she
buried
her
face
in
his
shoulder
and
cried
*NL*
painfully
.
She
was
one
of
those
women
who
can
not
cry
;
whom
it
hurts
as
*NL*
it
hurts
a
man
.
It
was
like
ripping
something
out
of
her
,
her
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
sat
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
his
hands
gripped
together
till
*NL*
the
knuckles
were
white
.
He
gazed
in
the
fire
,
feeling
almost
stunned
,
*NL*
as
if
he
could
not
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
came
to
an
end
,
soothed
the
child
and
cleared
away
the
*NL*
breakfast-table
.
She
left
the
newspaper
,
littered
with
curls
,
spread
*NL*
upon
the
hearthrug
.
At
last
her
husband
gathered
it
up
and
put
it
at
*NL*
the
back
of
the
fire
.
She
went
about
her
work
with
closed
mouth
and
very
*NL*
quiet
.
Morel
was
subdued
.
He
crept
about
wretchedly
,
and
his
meals
were
*NL*
a
misery
that
day
.
She
spoke
to
him
civilly
,
and
never
alluded
to
what
*NL*
he
had
done
.
But
he
felt
something
final
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
she
said
she
had
been
silly
,
that
the
boy
's
hair
would
have
*NL*
had
to
be
cut
,
sooner
or
later
.
In
the
end
,
she
even
brought
herself
to
*NL*
say
to
her
husband
it
was
just
as
well
he
had
played
barber
when
he
*NL*
did
.
But
she
knew
,
and
Morel
knew
,
that
that
act
had
caused
something
*NL*
momentous
to
take
place
in
her
soul
.
She
remembered
the
scene
all
her
*NL*
life
,
as
one
in
which
she
had
suffered
the
most
intensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
act
of
masculine
clumsiness
was
the
spear
through
the
side
of
her
*NL*
love
for
Morel
.
Before
,
while
she
had
striven
against
him
bitterly
,
she
*NL*
had
fretted
after
him
,
as
if
he
had
gone
astray
from
her
.
Now
she
ceased
*NL*
to
fret
for
his
love
:
he
was
an
outsider
to
her
.
This
made
life
much
*NL*
more
bearable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
she
still
continued
to
strive
with
him
.
She
still
had
her
*NL*
high
moral
sense
,
inherited
from
generations
of
Puritans
.
It
was
now
a
*NL*
religious
instinct
,
and
she
was
almost
a
fanatic
with
him
,
because
*NL*
she
loved
him
,
or
had
loved
him
.
If
he
sinned
,
she
tortured
him
.
If
he
*NL*
drank
,
and
lied
,
was
often
a
poltroon
,
sometimes
a
knave
,
she
wielded
*NL*
the
lash
unmercifully
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pity
was
,
she
was
too
much
his
opposite
.
She
could
not
be
content
*NL*
with
the
little
he
might
be
;
she
would
have
him
the
much
that
he
ought
*NL*
to
be
.
So
,
in
seeking
to
make
him
nobler
than
he
could
be
,
she
destroyed
*NL*
him
.
She
injured
and
hurt
and
scarred
herself
,
but
she
lost
none
of
her
*NL*
worth
.
She
also
had
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drank
rather
heavily
,
though
not
more
than
many
miners
,
and
always
*NL*
beer
,
so
that
whilst
his
health
was
affected
,
it
was
never
injured
.
*NL*
The
week-end
was
his
chief
carouse
.
He
sat
in
the
Miners
'
Arms
until
*NL*
turning-out
time
every
Friday
,
every
Saturday
,
and
every
Sunday
evening
.
*NL*
On
Monday
and
Tuesday
he
had
to
get
up
and
reluctantly
leave
towards
ten
*NL*
o'clock
.
Sometimes
he
stayed
at
home
on
Wednesday
and
Thursday
evenings
,
*NL*
or
was
only
out
for
an
hour
.
He
practically
never
had
to
miss
work
owing
*NL*
to
his
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
although
he
was
very
steady
at
work
,
his
wages
fell
off
.
He
was
*NL*
blab-mouthed
,
a
tongue-wagger
.
Authority
was
hateful
to
him
,
therefore
*NL*
he
could
only
abuse
the
pit-managers
.
He
would
say
,
in
the
Palmerston
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Th
'
gaffer
come
down
to
our
stall
this
morning
,
an
'
'
e
says
,
`
You
know
,
*NL*
Walter
,
this
`
ere
'll
not
do
.
What
about
these
props
?
'
An
'
I
says
to
him
,
*NL*
`
Why
,
what
art
talkin
'
about
?
What
d'st
mean
about
th
'
props
?
'
`
It
'll
*NL*
never
do
,
this
`
ere
,
'
'
e
says
.
`
You
'll
be
havin
'
th
'
roof
in
,
one
o
'
*NL*
these
days
.
'
An
'
I
says
,
`
Tha
'd
better
stan
'
on
a
bit
o
'
clunch
,
then
,
*NL*
an
'
hold
it
up
wi
'
thy
`
ead
.
'
So
'
e
wor
that
mad
,
'
e
cossed
an
'
'
e
*NL*
swore
,
an
'
t
`
other
chaps
they
did
laugh
.
''
Morel
was
a
good
mimic
.
He
*NL*
imitated
the
manager
's
fat
,
squeaky
voice
,
with
its
attempt
at
good
*NL*
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
sha
n't
have
it
,
Walter
.
Who
knows
more
about
it
,
me
or
you
?
'
So
*NL*
I
says
,
`
I
've
niver
fun
out
how
much
tha
'
knows
,
Alfred
.
It
'll
`
appen
*NL*
carry
thee
ter
bed
an
'
back
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
Morel
would
go
on
to
the
amusement
of
his
boon
companions
.
And
some
*NL*
of
this
would
be
true
.
The
pit-manager
was
not
an
educated
man
.
He
had
*NL*
been
a
boy
along
with
Morel
,
so
that
,
while
the
two
disliked
each
other
,
*NL*
they
more
or
less
took
each
other
for
granted
.
But
Alfred
Charlesworth
*NL*
did
not
forgive
the
butty
these
public-house
sayings
.
Consequently
,
*NL*
although
Morel
was
a
good
miner
,
sometimes
earning
as
much
as
five
*NL*
pounds
a
week
when
he
married
,
he
came
gradually
to
have
worse
and
worse
*NL*
stalls
,
where
the
coal
was
thin
,
and
hard
to
get
,
and
unprofitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Also
,
in
summer
,
the
pits
are
slack
.
Often
,
on
bright
sunny
mornings
,
*NL*
the
men
are
seen
trooping
home
again
at
ten
,
eleven
,
or
twelve
o'clock
.
*NL*
No
empty
trucks
stand
at
the
pit-mouth
.
The
women
on
the
hillside
look
*NL*
across
as
they
shake
the
hearthrug
against
the
fence
,
and
count
the
*NL*
wagons
the
engine
is
taking
along
the
line
up
the
valley
.
And
the
*NL*
children
,
as
they
come
from
school
at
dinner-time
,
looking
down
the
*NL*
fields
and
seeing
the
wheels
on
the
headstocks
standing
,
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Minton
's
knocked
off
.
My
dad
'll
be
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
is
a
sort
of
shadow
over
all
,
women
and
children
and
men
,
*NL*
because
money
will
be
short
at
the
end
of
the
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
was
supposed
to
give
his
wife
thirty
shillings
a
week
,
to
*NL*
provide
everything
--
rent
,
food
,
clothes
,
clubs
,
insurance
,
doctors
.
*NL*
Occasionally
,
if
he
were
flush
,
he
gave
her
thirty-five
.
But
these
*NL*
occasions
by
no
means
balanced
those
when
he
gave
her
twenty-five
.
In
*NL*
winter
,
with
a
decent
stall
,
the
miner
might
earn
fifty
or
fifty-five
*NL*
shillings
a
week
.
Then
he
was
happy
.
On
Friday
night
,
Saturday
,
and
*NL*
Sunday
,
he
spent
royally
,
getting
rid
of
his
sovereign
or
thereabouts
.
*NL*
And
out
of
so
much
,
he
scarcely
spared
the
children
an
extra
penny
or
*NL*
bought
them
a
pound
of
apples
.
It
all
went
in
drink
.
In
the
bad
times
,
*NL*
matters
were
more
worrying
,
but
he
was
not
so
often
drunk
,
so
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
used
to
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
I
would
n't
rather
be
short
,
for
when
he
's
flush
,
there
*NL*
is
n't
a
minute
of
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
earned
forty
shillings
he
kept
ten
;
from
thirty-five
he
kept
five
;
*NL*
from
thirty-two
he
kept
four
;
from
twenty-eight
he
kept
three
;
from
*NL*
twenty-four
he
kept
two
;
from
twenty
he
kept
one-and-six
;
from
eighteen
*NL*
he
kept
a
shilling
;
from
sixteen
he
kept
sixpence
.
He
never
saved
a
*NL*
penny
,
and
he
gave
his
wife
no
opportunity
of
saving
;
instead
,
she
had
*NL*
occasionally
to
pay
his
debts
;
not
public-house
debts
,
for
those
never
*NL*
were
passed
on
to
the
women
,
but
debts
when
he
had
bought
a
canary
,
or
a
*NL*
fancy
walking-stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
wakes
time
Morel
was
working
badly
,
and
Mrs.
Morel
was
trying
*NL*
to
save
against
her
confinement
.
So
it
galled
her
bitterly
to
think
*NL*
he
should
be
out
taking
his
pleasure
and
spending
money
,
whilst
she
*NL*
remained
at
home
,
harassed
.
There
were
two
days
'
holiday
.
On
the
Tuesday
*NL*
morning
Morel
rose
early
.
He
was
in
good
spirits
.
Quite
early
,
before
*NL*
six
o'clock
,
she
heard
him
whistling
away
to
himself
downstairs
.
He
*NL*
had
a
pleasant
way
of
whistling
,
lively
and
musical
.
He
nearly
always
*NL*
whistled
hymns
.
He
had
been
a
choir-boy
with
a
beautiful
voice
,
and
had
*NL*
taken
solos
in
Southwell
cathedral
.
His
morning
whistling
alone
betrayed
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
lay
listening
to
him
tinkering
away
in
the
garden
,
his
*NL*
whistling
ringing
out
as
he
sawed
and
hammered
away
.
It
always
gave
*NL*
her
a
sense
of
warmth
and
peace
to
hear
him
thus
as
she
lay
in
bed
,
the
*NL*
children
not
yet
awake
,
in
the
bright
early
morning
,
happy
in
his
man
's
*NL*
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
,
while
the
children
with
bare
legs
and
feet
were
sitting
*NL*
playing
on
the
sofa
,
and
the
mother
was
washing
up
,
he
came
in
from
his
*NL*
carpentry
,
his
sleeves
rolled
up
,
his
waistcoat
hanging
open
.
He
was
*NL*
still
a
good-looking
man
,
with
black
,
wavy
hair
,
and
a
large
black
*NL*
moustache
.
His
face
was
perhaps
too
much
inflamed
,
and
there
was
about
*NL*
him
a
look
almost
of
peevishness
.
But
now
he
was
jolly
.
He
went
straight
*NL*
to
the
sink
where
his
wife
was
washing
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
are
thee
there
!
''
he
said
boisterously
.
``
Sluthe
off
an
'
let
me
*NL*
wesh
mysen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
wait
till
I
've
finished
,
''
said
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mun
I
?
An
'
what
if
I
shonna
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
good-humoured
threat
amused
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
can
go
and
wash
yourself
in
the
soft-water
tub
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
I
can
'
an
'
a
'
,
tha
mucky
little
`
ussy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
which
he
stood
watching
her
a
moment
,
then
went
away
to
wait
for
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
chose
he
could
still
make
himself
again
a
real
gallant
.
Usually
*NL*
he
preferred
to
go
out
with
a
scarf
round
his
neck
.
Now
,
however
,
he
*NL*
made
a
toilet
.
There
seemed
so
much
gusto
in
the
way
he
puffed
and
*NL*
swilled
as
he
washed
himself
,
so
much
alacrity
with
which
he
hurried
to
*NL*
the
mirror
in
the
kitchen
,
and
,
bending
because
it
was
too
low
for
him
,
*NL*
scrupulously
parted
his
wet
black
hair
,
that
it
irritated
Mrs.
Morel
.
He
*NL*
put
on
a
turn-down
collar
,
a
black
bow
,
and
wore
his
Sunday
tail-coat
.
*NL*
As
such
,
he
looked
spruce
,
and
what
his
clothes
would
not
do
,
his
*NL*
instinct
for
making
the
most
of
his
good
looks
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
nine
Jerry
Purdy
came
to
call
for
his
pal
.
Jerry
was
*NL*
Morel
's
bosom
friend
,
and
Mrs.
Morel
disliked
him
.
He
was
a
tall
,
*NL*
thin
man
,
with
a
rather
foxy
face
,
the
kind
of
face
that
seems
to
lack
*NL*
eyelashes
.
He
walked
with
a
stiff
,
brittle
dignity
,
as
if
his
head
were
*NL*
on
a
wooden
spring
.
His
nature
was
cold
and
shrewd
.
Generous
where
he
*NL*
intended
to
be
generous
,
he
seemed
to
be
very
fond
of
Morel
,
and
more
or
*NL*
less
to
take
charge
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
hated
him
.
She
had
known
his
wife
,
who
had
died
of
*NL*
consumption
,
and
who
had
,
at
the
end
,
conceived
such
a
violent
dislike
*NL*
of
her
husband
,
that
if
he
came
into
her
room
it
caused
her
haemorrhage
.
*NL*
None
of
which
Jerry
had
seemed
to
mind
.
And
now
his
eldest
daughter
,
*NL*
a
girl
of
fifteen
,
kept
a
poor
house
for
him
,
and
looked
after
the
two
*NL*
younger
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mean
,
wizzen-hearted
stick
!
''
Mrs.
Morel
said
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
never
known
Jerry
mean
in
MY
life
,
''
protested
Morel
.
``
A
*NL*
opener-handed
and
more
freer
chap
you
could
n't
find
anywhere
,
accordin
'
*NL*
to
my
knowledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open-handed
to
you
,
''
retorted
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
But
his
fist
is
shut
tight
*NL*
enough
to
his
children
,
poor
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
things
!
And
what
for
are
they
poor
things
,
I
should
like
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Morel
would
not
be
appeased
on
Jerry
's
score
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
of
argument
was
seen
,
craning
his
thin
neck
over
the
*NL*
scullery
curtain
.
He
caught
Mrs.
Morel
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mornin
'
,
missis
!
Mester
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jerry
entered
unasked
,
and
stood
by
the
kitchen
doorway
.
He
was
not
*NL*
invited
to
sit
down
,
but
stood
there
,
coolly
asserting
the
rights
of
men
*NL*
and
husbands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
day
,
''
he
said
to
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grand
out
this
morning
--
grand
for
a
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
YOU
'RE
going
for
a
walk
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
We
mean
walkin
'
to
Nottingham
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
greeted
each
other
,
both
glad
:
Jerry
,
however
,
full
of
*NL*
assurance
,
Morel
rather
subdued
,
afraid
to
seem
too
jubilant
in
presence
*NL*
of
his
wife
.
But
he
laced
his
boots
quickly
,
with
spirit
.
They
were
*NL*
going
for
a
ten-mile
walk
across
the
fields
to
Nottingham
.
Climbing
the
*NL*
hillside
from
the
Bottoms
,
they
mounted
gaily
into
the
morning
.
At
the
*NL*
Moon
and
Stars
they
had
their
first
drink
,
then
on
to
the
Old
Spot
.
Then
*NL*
a
long
five
miles
of
drought
to
carry
them
into
Bulwell
to
a
glorious
*NL*
pint
of
bitter
.
But
they
stayed
in
a
field
with
some
haymakers
whose
*NL*
gallon
bottle
was
full
,
so
that
,
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
city
,
*NL*
Morel
was
sleepy
.
The
town
spread
upwards
before
them
,
smoking
vaguely
*NL*
in
the
midday
glare
,
fridging
the
crest
away
to
the
south
with
spires
*NL*
and
factory
bulks
and
chimneys
.
In
the
last
field
Morel
lay
down
under
*NL*
an
oak
tree
and
slept
soundly
for
over
an
hour
.
When
he
rose
to
go
*NL*
forward
he
felt
queer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
had
dinner
in
the
Meadows
,
with
Jerry
's
sister
,
then
repaired
*NL*
to
the
Punch
Bowl
,
where
they
mixed
in
the
excitement
of
pigeon-racing
.
*NL*
Morel
never
in
his
life
played
cards
,
considering
them
as
having
some
*NL*
occult
,
malevolent
power
--
``
the
devil
's
pictures
,
''
he
called
them
!
But
*NL*
he
was
a
master
of
skittles
and
of
dominoes
.
He
took
a
challenge
from
*NL*
a
Newark
man
,
on
skittles
.
All
the
men
in
the
old
,
long
bar
took
sides
,
*NL*
betting
either
one
way
or
the
other
.
Morel
took
off
his
coat
.
Jerry
held
*NL*
the
hat
containing
the
money
.
The
men
at
the
tables
watched
.
Some
*NL*
stood
with
their
mugs
in
their
hands
.
Morel
felt
his
big
wooden
ball
*NL*
carefully
,
then
launched
it
.
He
played
havoc
among
the
nine-pins
,
and
*NL*
won
half
a
crown
,
which
restored
him
to
solvency
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
seven
o'clock
the
two
were
in
good
condition
.
They
caught
the
7.30
*NL*
train
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
the
Bottoms
was
intolerable
.
Every
inhabitant
remaining
*NL*
was
out
of
doors
.
The
women
,
in
twos
and
threes
,
bareheaded
and
in
white
*NL*
aprons
,
gossiped
in
the
alley
between
the
blocks
.
Men
,
having
a
rest
*NL*
between
drinks
,
sat
on
their
heels
and
talked
.
The
place
smelled
stale
;
*NL*
the
slate
roofs
glistered
in
the
arid
heat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
took
the
little
girl
down
to
the
brook
in
the
meadows
,
which
*NL*
were
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
away
.
The
water
ran
quickly
over
*NL*
stones
and
broken
pots
.
Mother
and
child
leaned
on
the
rail
of
the
old
*NL*
sheep-bridge
,
watching
.
Up
at
the
dipping-hole
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
meadow
,
Mrs.
Morel
could
see
the
naked
forms
of
boys
flashing
round
the
*NL*
deep
yellow
water
,
or
an
occasional
bright
figure
dart
glittering
over
*NL*
the
blackish
stagnant
meadow
.
She
knew
William
was
at
the
dipping-hole
,
*NL*
and
it
was
the
dread
of
her
life
lest
he
should
get
drowned
.
Annie
*NL*
played
under
the
tall
old
hedge
,
picking
up
alder
cones
,
that
she
called
*NL*
currants
.
The
child
required
much
attention
,
and
the
flies
were
teasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
were
put
to
bed
at
seven
o'clock
.
Then
she
worked
awhile
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Walter
Morel
and
Jerry
arrived
at
Bestwood
they
felt
a
load
off
*NL*
their
minds
;
a
railway
journey
no
longer
impended
,
so
they
could
put
the
*NL*
finishing
touches
to
a
glorious
day
.
They
entered
the
Nelson
with
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
returned
travellers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
a
work-day
,
and
the
thought
of
it
put
a
damper
on
the
*NL*
men
's
spirits
.
Most
of
them
,
moreover
,
had
spent
their
money
.
Some
were
*NL*
already
rolling
dismally
home
,
to
sleep
in
preparation
for
the
morrow
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
,
listening
to
their
mournful
singing
,
went
indoors
.
Nine
*NL*
o'clock
passed
,
and
ten
,
and
still
``
the
pair
''
had
not
returned
.
On
a
*NL*
doorstep
somewhere
a
man
was
singing
loudly
,
in
a
drawl
:
``
Lead
,
kindly
*NL*
Light
.
''
Mrs.
Morel
was
always
indignant
with
the
drunken
men
that
they
*NL*
must
sing
that
hymn
when
they
got
maudlin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
`
Genevieve
'
were
n't
good
enough
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kitchen
was
full
of
the
scent
of
boiled
herbs
and
hops
.
On
the
hob
a
*NL*
large
black
saucepan
steamed
slowly
.
Mrs.
Morel
took
a
panchion
,
a
great
*NL*
bowl
of
thick
red
earth
,
streamed
a
heap
of
white
sugar
into
the
bottom
,
*NL*
and
then
,
straining
herself
to
the
weight
,
was
pouring
in
the
liquor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Morel
came
in
.
He
had
been
very
jolly
in
the
Nelson
,
but
*NL*
coming
home
had
grown
irritable
.
He
had
not
quite
got
over
the
feeling
*NL*
of
irritability
and
pain
,
after
having
slept
on
the
ground
when
he
was
*NL*
so
hot
;
and
a
bad
conscience
afflicted
him
as
he
neared
the
house
.
*NL*
He
did
not
know
he
was
angry
.
But
when
the
garden
gate
resisted
his
*NL*
attempts
to
open
it
,
he
kicked
it
and
broke
the
latch
.
He
entered
just
*NL*
as
Mrs.
Morel
was
pouring
the
infusion
of
herbs
out
of
the
saucepan
.
*NL*
Swaying
slightly
,
he
lurched
against
the
table
.
The
boiling
liquor
*NL*
pitched
.
Mrs.
Morel
started
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
,
''
she
cried
,
``
coming
home
in
his
drunkenness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Comin
'
home
in
his
what
?
''
he
snarled
,
his
hat
over
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
her
blood
rose
in
a
jet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
you
're
NOT
drunk
!
''
she
flashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
put
down
her
saucepan
,
and
was
stirring
the
sugar
into
the
*NL*
beer
.
He
dropped
his
two
hands
heavily
on
the
table
,
and
thrust
his
face
*NL*
forwards
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Say
you
're
not
drunk
,
'
''
he
repeated
.
``
Why
,
nobody
but
a
nasty
little
*NL*
bitch
like
you
`
ud
`
ave
such
a
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thrust
his
face
forward
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
money
to
bezzle
with
,
if
there
's
money
for
nothing
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
spent
a
two-shillin
'
bit
this
day
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
get
as
drunk
as
a
lord
on
nothing
,
''
she
replied
.
``
And
,
''
*NL*
she
cried
,
flashing
into
sudden
fury
,
``
if
you
've
been
sponging
on
your
*NL*
beloved
Jerry
,
why
,
let
him
look
after
his
children

for
they
need
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
lie
,
it
's
a
lie
.
Shut
your
face
,
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
now
at
battle-pitch
.
Each
forgot
everything
save
the
hatred
of
*NL*
the
other
and
the
battle
between
them
.
She
was
fiery
and
furious
as
he
.
*NL*
They
went
on
till
he
called
her
a
liar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
cried
,
starting
up
,
scarce
able
to
breathe
.
``
Do
n't
call
me
*NL*
that
--
you
,
the
most
despicable
liar
that
ever
walked
in
shoe-leather
.
''
*NL*
She
forced
the
last
words
out
of
suffocated
lungs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
liar
!
''
he
yelled
,
banging
the
table
with
his
fist
.
``
You
're
a
*NL*
liar
,
you
're
a
liar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stiffened
herself
,
with
clenched
fists
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
is
filthy
with
you
,
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
get
out
on
it
--
it
's
mine

Get
out
on

he
shouted
.
``
It
's
me

Then

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
would

''
she
cried
,
suddenly
shaken
into
tears
of
impotence
.
``
Ah
,
*NL*
would
n't
I
,
would
n't
I
have
gone
long
ago
,
but
for

.
Ay

*NL*
have

I
repented
not
going
years
ago
,
when
I

--
suddenly
*NL*
drying
into
rage
.
``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

then

he
shouted
,
beside
himself
.
``
Go

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

She
faced
round
.
``
No

she
cried
loudly
,
``

she
laughed
,
``
I
should
look
well
to
leave
them
to
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

''
he
cried
thickly
,
lifting
his
fist
.
He
was
afraid
of
her
.
``
Go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
only
too
glad
.
I
should
laugh
,
laugh
,
my
lord
,
if
I
could
*NL*
get
away
from
you
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
up
to
her
,
his
red
face
,
with
its
bloodshot
eyes
,
thrust
*NL*
forward
,
and
gripped
her
arms
.
She
cried
in
fear
of
him
,
struggled
to
be
*NL*
free
.
Coming
slightly
to
himself
,
panting
,
he
pushed
her
roughly
to
the
*NL*
outer
door
,
and
thrust
her
forth
,
slotting
the
bolt
behind
her
with
a
*NL*
bang
.
Then
he
went
back
into
the
kitchen
,
dropped
into
his
armchair
,
his
*NL*
head
,
bursting
full
of
blood
,
sinking
between
his
knees
.
Thus
he
dipped
*NL*
gradually
into
a
stupor
,
from
exhaustion
and
intoxication
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
was
high
and
magnificent
in
the
August
night
.
Mrs.
Morel
,
*NL*
seared
with
passion
,
shivered
to
find
herself
out
there
in
a
great
white
*NL*
light
,
that
fell
cold
on
her
,
and
gave
a
shock
to
her
inflamed
soul
.
*NL*
She
stood
for
a
few
moments
helplessly
staring
at
the
glistening
great
*NL*
rhubarb
leaves
near
the
door
.
Then
she
got
the
air
into
her
breast
.
She
*NL*
walked
down
the
garden
path
,
trembling
in
every
limb
,
while
the
child
*NL*
boiled
within
her
.
For
a
while
she
could
not
control
her
consciousness
;
*NL*
mechanically
she
went
over
the
last
scene
,
then
over
it
again
,
certain
*NL*
phrases
,
certain
moments
coming
each
time
like
a
brand
red-hot
down
on
*NL*
her
soul
;
and
each
time
she
enacted
again
the
past
hour
,
each
time
the
*NL*
brand
came
down
at
the
same
points
,
till
the
mark
was
burnt
in
,
and
the
*NL*
pain
burnt
out
,
and
at
last
she
came
to
herself
.
She
must
have
been
half
*NL*
an
hour
in
this
delirious
condition
.
Then
the
presence
of
the
night
came
*NL*
again
to
her
.
She
glanced
round
in
fear
.
She
had
wandered
to
the
side
*NL*
garden
,
where
she
was
walking
up
and
down
the
path
beside
the
currant
*NL*
bushes
under
the
long
wall
.
The
garden
was
a
narrow
strip
,
bounded
from
*NL*
the
road
,
that
cut
transversely
between
the
blocks
,
by
a
thick
thorn
*NL*
hedge
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hurried
out
of
the
side
garden
to
the
front
,
where
she
could
stand
*NL*
as
if
in
an
immense
gulf
of
white
light
,
the
moon
streaming
high
in
face
*NL*
of
her
,
the
moonlight
standing
up
from
the
hills
in
front
,
and
filling
*NL*
the
valley
where
the
Bottoms
crouched
,
almost
blindingly
.
There
,
panting
*NL*
and
half
weeping
in
reaction
from
the
stress
,
she
murmured
to
herself
*NL*
over
and
over
again
:
``
The
nuisance
!
the
nuisance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
became
aware
of
something
about
her
.
With
an
effort
she
roused
*NL*
herself
to
see
what
it
was
that
penetrated
her
consciousness
.
The
tall
*NL*
white
lilies
were
reeling
in
the
moonlight
,
and
the
air
was
charged
with
*NL*
their
perfume
,
as
with
a
presence
.
Mrs.
Morel
gasped
slightly
in
fear
.
*NL*
She
touched
the
big
,
pallid
flowers
on
their
petals
,
then
shivered
.
*NL*
They
seemed
to
be
stretching
in
the
moonlight
.
She
put
her
hand
into
*NL*
one
white
bin
:
the
gold
scarcely
showed
on
her
fingers
by
moonlight
.
She
*NL*
bent
down
to
look
at
the
binful
of
yellow
pollen
;
but
it
only
appeared
*NL*
dusky
.
Then
she
drank
a
deep
draught
of
the
scent
.
It
almost
made
her
*NL*
dizzy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
leaned
on
the
garden
gate
,
looking
out
,
and
she
lost
herself
*NL*
awhile
.
She
did
not
know
what
she
thought
.
Except
for
a
slight
feeling
*NL*
of
sickness
,
and
her
consciousness
in
the
child
,
herself
melted
out
like
*NL*
scent
into
the
shiny
,
pale
air
.
After
a
time
the
child
,
too
,
melted
with
*NL*
her
in
the
mixing-pot
of
moonlight
,
and
she
rested
with
the
hills
and
*NL*
lilies
and
houses
,
all
swum
together
in
a
kind
of
swoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
came
to
herself
she
was
tired
for
sleep
.
Languidly
she
looked
*NL*
about
her
;
the
clumps
of
white
phlox
seemed
like
bushes
spread
with
*NL*
linen
;
a
moth
ricochetted
over
them
,
and
right
across
the
garden
.
*NL*
Following
it
with
her
eye
roused
her
.
A
few
whiffs
of
the
raw
,
strong
*NL*
scent
of
phlox
invigorated
her
.
She
passed
along
the
path
,
hesitating
at
*NL*
the
white
rose-bush
.
It
smelled
sweet
and
simple
.
She
touched
the
white
*NL*
ruffles
of
the
roses
.
Their
fresh
scent
and
cool
,
soft
leaves
reminded
*NL*
her
of
the
morning-time
and
sunshine
.
She
was
very
fond
of
them
.
But
she
*NL*
was
tired
,
and
wanted
to
sleep
.
In
the
mysterious
out-of-doors
she
felt
*NL*
forlorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
noise
anywhere
.
Evidently
the
children
had
not
been
*NL*
wakened
,
or
had
gone
to
sleep
again
.
A
train
,
three
miles
away
,
*NL*
roared
across
the
valley
.
The
night
was
very
large
,
and
very
strange
,
*NL*
stretching
its
hoary
distances
infinitely
.
And
out
of
the
silver-grey
*NL*
fog
of
darkness
came
sounds
vague
and
hoarse
:
a
corncrake
not
far
off
,
*NL*
sound
of
a
train
like
a
sigh
,
and
distant
shouts
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
quietened
heart
beginning
to
beat
quickly
again
,
she
hurried
down
*NL*
the
side
garden
to
the
back
of
the
house
.
Softly
she
lifted
the
latch
;
*NL*
the
door
was
still
bolted
,
and
hard
against
her
.
She
rapped
gently
,
*NL*
waited
,
then
rapped
again
.
She
must
not
rouse
the
children
,
nor
the
*NL*
neighbours
.
He
must
be
asleep
,
and
he
would
not
wake
easily
.
Her
heart
*NL*
began
to
burn
to
be
indoors
.
She
clung
to
the
door-handle
.
Now
it
was
*NL*
cold
;
she
would
take
a
chill
,
and
in
her
present
condition
!
*NL*
*NL*
Putting
her
apron
over
her
head
and
her
arms
,
she
hurried
again
to
the
*NL*
side
garden
,
to
the
window
of
the
kitchen
.
Leaning
on
the
sill
,
she
*NL*
could
just
see
,
under
the
blind
,
her
husband
's
arms
spread
out
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
his
black
head
on
the
board
.
He
was
sleeping
with
his
face
*NL*
lying
on
the
table
.
Something
in
his
attitude
made
her
feel
tired
of
*NL*
things
.
The
lamp
was
burning
smokily
;
she
could
tell
by
the
copper
*NL*
colour
of
the
light
.
She
tapped
at
the
window
more
and
more
noisily
.
*NL*
Almost
it
seemed
as
if
the
glass
would
break
.
Still
he
did
not
wake
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
vain
efforts
,
she
began
to
shiver
,
partly
from
contact
with
the
*NL*
stone
,
and
from
exhaustion
.
Fearful
always
for
the
unborn
child
,
she
*NL*
wondered
what
she
could
do
for
warmth
.
She
went
down
to
the
coal-house
,
*NL*
where
there
was
an
old
hearthrug
she
had
carried
out
for
the
rag-man
the
*NL*
day
before
.
This
she
wrapped
over
her
shoulders
.
It
was
warm
,
if
grimy
.
*NL*
Then
she
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
path
,
peeping
every
now
and
then
*NL*
under
the
blind
,
knocking
,
and
telling
herself
that
in
the
end
the
very
*NL*
strain
of
his
position
must
wake
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
after
about
an
hour
,
she
rapped
long
and
low
at
the
window
.
*NL*
Gradually
the
sound
penetrated
to
him
.
When
,
in
despair
,
she
had
ceased
*NL*
to
tap
,
she
saw
him
stir
,
then
lift
his
face
blindly
.
The
labouring
of
*NL*
his
heart
hurt
him
into
consciousness
.
She
rapped
imperatively
at
the
*NL*
window
.
He
started
awake
.
Instantly
she
saw
his
fists
set
and
his
*NL*
eyes
glare
.
He
had
not
a
grain
of
physical
fear
.
If
it
had
been
*NL*
twenty
burglars
,
he
would
have
gone
blindly
for
them
.
He
glared
round
,
*NL*
bewildered
,
but
prepared
to
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open
the
door
,
Walter
,
''
she
said
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hands
relaxed
.
It
dawned
on
him
what
he
had
done
.
His
head
dropped
,
*NL*
sullen
and
dogged
.
She
saw
him
hurry
to
the
door
,
heard
the
bolt
chock
.
*NL*
He
tried
the
latch
.
It
opened
--
and
there
stood
the
silver-grey
night
,
*NL*
fearful
to
him
,
after
the
tawny
light
of
the
lamp
.
He
hurried
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Morel
entered
,
she
saw
him
almost
running
through
the
door
*NL*
to
the
stairs
.
He
had
ripped
his
collar
off
his
neck
in
his
haste
to
*NL*
be
gone
ere
she
came
in
,
and
there
it
lay
with
bursten
button-holes
.
It
*NL*
made
her
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
warmed
and
soothed
herself
.
In
her
weariness
forgetting
everything
,
*NL*
she
moved
about
at
the
little
tasks
that
remained
to
be
done
,
set
his
*NL*
breakfast
,
rinsed
his
pit-bottle
,
put
his
pit-clothes
on
the
hearth
*NL*
to
warm
,
set
his
pit-boots
beside
them
,
put
him
out
a
clean
scarf
and
*NL*
snap-bag
and
two
apples
,
raked
the
fire
,
and
went
to
bed
.
He
was
already
*NL*
dead
asleep
.
His
narrow
black
eyebrows
were
drawn
up
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
peevish
misery
into
his
forehead
while
his
cheeks
'
down-strokes
,
and
his
*NL*
sulky
mouth
,
seemed
to
be
saying
:
``
I
do
n't
care
who
you
are
nor
what
you
*NL*
are
,
I
SHALL
have
my
own
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
knew
him
too
well
to
look
at
him
.
As
she
unfastened
her
*NL*
brooch
at
the
mirror
,
she
smiled
faintly
to
see
her
face
all
smeared
*NL*
with
the
yellow
dust
of
lilies
.
She
brushed
it
off
,
and
at
last
lay
*NL*
down
.
For
some
time
her
mind
continued
snapping
and
jetting
sparks
,
*NL*
but
she
was
asleep
before
her
husband
awoke
from
the
first
sleep
of
his
*NL*
drunkenness
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
THE
BIRTH
OF
PAUL
,
AND
ANOTHER
BATTLE
*NL*
*NL*
AFTER
such
a
scene
as
the
last
,
Walter
Morel
was
for
some
days
abashed
*NL*
and
ashamed
,
but
he
soon
regained
his
old
bullying
indifference
.
Yet
*NL*
there
was
a
slight
shrinking
,
a
diminishing
in
his
assurance
.
Physically
*NL*
even
,
he
shrank
,
and
his
fine
full
presence
waned
.
He
never
grew
in
the
*NL*
least
stout
,
so
that
,
as
he
sank
from
his
erect
,
assertive
bearing
,
his
*NL*
physique
seemed
to
contract
along
with
his
pride
and
moral
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
he
realised
how
hard
it
was
for
his
wife
to
drag
about
at
her
*NL*
work
,
and
,
his
sympathy
quickened
by
penitence
,
hastened
forward
with
*NL*
his
help
.
He
came
straight
home
from
the
pit
,
and
stayed
in
at
evening
*NL*
till
Friday
,
and
then
he
could
not
remain
at
home
.
But
he
was
back
again
*NL*
by
ten
o'clock
,
almost
quite
sober
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
always
made
his
own
breakfast
.
Being
a
man
who
rose
early
and
had
*NL*
plenty
of
time
he
did
not
,
as
some
miners
do
,
drag
his
wife
out
of
bed
*NL*
at
six
o'clock
.
At
five
,
sometimes
earlier
,
he
woke
,
got
straight
out
of
*NL*
bed
,
and
went
downstairs
.
When
she
could
not
sleep
,
his
wife
lay
waiting
*NL*
for
this
time
,
as
for
a
period
of
peace
.
The
only
real
rest
seemed
to
be
*NL*
when
he
was
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
downstairs
in
his
shirt
and
then
struggled
into
his
*NL*
pit-trousers
,
which
were
left
on
the
hearth
to
warm
all
night
.
There
*NL*
was
always
a
fire
,
because
Mrs.
Morel
raked
.
And
the
first
sound
in
*NL*
the
house
was
the
bang
,
bang
of
the
poker
against
the
raker
,
as
Morel
*NL*
smashed
the
remainder
of
the
coal
to
make
the
kettle
,
which
was
filled
*NL*
and
left
on
the
hob
,
finally
boil
.
His
cup
and
knife
and
fork
,
all
he
*NL*
wanted
except
just
the
food
,
was
laid
ready
on
the
table
on
a
newspaper
.
*NL*
Then
he
got
his
breakfast
,
made
the
tea
,
packed
the
bottom
of
the
doors
*NL*
with
rugs
to
shut
out
the
draught
,
piled
a
big
fire
,
and
sat
down
to
an
*NL*
hour
of
joy
.
He
toasted
his
bacon
on
a
fork
and
caught
the
drops
of
fat
*NL*
on
his
bread
;
then
he
put
the
rasher
on
his
thick
slice
of
bread
,
and
*NL*
cut
off
chunks
with
a
clasp-knife
,
poured
his
tea
into
his
saucer
,
*NL*
and
was
happy
.
With
his
family
about
,
meals
were
never
so
pleasant
.
He
*NL*
loathed
a
fork
:
it
is
a
modern
introduction
which
has
still
scarcely
*NL*
reached
common
people
.
What
Morel
preferred
was
a
clasp-knife
.
Then
,
in
*NL*
solitude
,
he
ate
and
drank
,
often
sitting
,
in
cold
weather
,
on
a
little
*NL*
stool
with
his
back
to
the
warm
chimney-piece
,
his
food
on
the
fender
,
*NL*
his
cup
on
the
hearth
.
And
then
he
read
the
last
night
's
newspaper
--
what
*NL*
of
it
he
could
--
spelling
it
over
laboriously
.
He
preferred
to
keep
the
*NL*
blinds
down
and
the
candle
lit
even
when
it
was
daylight
;
it
was
the
*NL*
habit
of
the
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
quarter
to
six
he
rose
,
cut
two
thick
slices
of
bread
and
butter
,
*NL*
and
put
them
in
the
white
calico
snap-bag
.
He
filled
his
tin
bottle
with
*NL*
tea
.
Cold
tea
without
milk
or
sugar
was
the
drink
he
preferred
for
the
*NL*
pit
.
Then
he
pulled
off
his
shirt
,
and
put
on
his
pit-singlet
,
a
vest
*NL*
of
thick
flannel
cut
low
round
the
neck
,
and
with
short
sleeves
like
a
*NL*
chemise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
upstairs
to
his
wife
with
a
cup
of
tea
because
she
was
ill
,
*NL*
and
because
it
occurred
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
brought
thee
a
cup
o
'
tea
,
lass
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
need
n't
,
for
you
know
I
do
n't
like
it
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
it
up
;
it
'll
pop
thee
off
to
sleep
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
accepted
the
tea
.
It
pleased
him
to
see
her
take
it
and
sip
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
back
my
life
there
's
no
sugar
in
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yi
--
there
's
one
big
`
un
,
''
he
replied
,
injured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
wonder
,
''
she
said
,
sipping
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
winsome
face
when
her
hair
was
loose
.
He
loved
her
to
grumble
*NL*
at
him
in
this
manner
.
He
looked
at
her
again
,
and
went
,
without
any
*NL*
sort
of
leave-taking
.
He
never
took
more
than
two
slices
of
bread
and
*NL*
butter
to
eat
in
the
pit
,
so
an
apple
or
an
orange
was
a
treat
to
him
.
*NL*
He
always
liked
it
when
she
put
one
out
for
him
.
He
tied
a
scarf
round
*NL*
his
neck
,
put
on
his
great
,
heavy
boots
,
his
coat
,
with
the
big
pocket
,
*NL*
that
carried
his
snap-bag
and
his
bottle
of
tea
,
and
went
forth
into
*NL*
the
fresh
morning
air
,
closing
,
without
locking
,
the
door
behind
him
.
He
*NL*
loved
the
early
morning
,
and
the
walk
across
the
fields
.
So
he
appeared
*NL*
at
the
pit-top
,
often
with
a
stalk
from
the
hedge
between
his
teeth
,
*NL*
which
he
chewed
all
day
to
keep
his
mouth
moist
,
down
the
mine
,
feeling
*NL*
quite
as
happy
as
when
he
was
in
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
,
when
the
time
for
the
baby
grew
nearer
,
he
would
bustle
round
*NL*
in
his
slovenly
fashion
,
poking
out
the
ashes
,
rubbing
the
fireplace
,
*NL*
sweeping
the
house
before
he
went
to
work
.
Then
,
feeling
very
*NL*
self-righteous
,
he
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
'm
cleaned
up
for
thee
:
tha
's
no
`
casions
ter
stir
a
peg
all
day
,
*NL*
but
sit
and
read
thy
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
made
her
laugh
,
in
spite
of
her
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
dinner
cooks
itself
?
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
I
know
nowt
about
th
'
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
know
if
there
were
n't
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
`
appen
so
,
''
he
answered
,
departing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
got
downstairs
,
she
would
find
the
house
tidy
,
but
dirty
.
She
*NL*
could
not
rest
until
she
had
thoroughly
cleaned
;
so
she
went
down
to
the
*NL*
ash-pit
with
her
dustpan
.
Mrs.
Kirk
,
spying
her
,
would
contrive
to
have
*NL*
to
go
to
her
own
coal-place
at
that
minute
.
Then
,
across
the
wooden
*NL*
fence
,
she
would
call
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
keep
wagging
on
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
answered
Mrs.
Morel
deprecatingly
.
``
There
's
nothing
else
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
Hose
?
''
called
a
very
small
woman
from
across
the
road
.
It
*NL*
was
Mrs.
Anthony
,
a
black-haired
,
strange
little
body
,
who
always
wore
a
*NL*
brown
velvet
dress
,
tight
fitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
I
wish
he
'd
come
.
I
've
got
a
copperful
of
clothes
,
an

I
'm
sure
I
*NL*
heered
his
bell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
!
He
's
at
the
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
women
looked
down
the
alley
.
At
the
end
of
the
Bottoms
a
*NL*
man
stood
in
a
sort
of
old-fashioned
trap
,
bending
over
bundles
of
*NL*
cream-coloured
stuff
;
while
a
cluster
of
women
held
up
their
arms
to
*NL*
him
,
some
with
bundles
.
Mrs.
Anthony
herself
had
a
heap
of
creamy
,
*NL*
undyed
stockings
hanging
over
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
done
ten
dozen
this
week
,
''
she
said
proudly
to
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
T-t-t
!
''
went
the
other
.
``
I
do
n't
know
how
you
can
find
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
said
Mrs.
Anthony
.
``
You
can
find
time
if
you
make
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
you
do
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
And
how
much
shall
you
*NL*
get
for
those
many
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tuppence-ha
`
penny
a
dozen
,
''
replied
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
I
'd
starve
before
I
'd
sit
down
and
seam
*NL*
twenty-four
stockings
for
twopence
ha

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Mrs.
Anthony
.
``
You
can
rip
along
with
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hose
was
coming
along
,
ringing
his
bell
.
Women
were
waiting
at
the
*NL*
yard-ends
with
their
seamed
stockings
hanging
over
their
arms
.
The
*NL*
man
,
a
common
fellow
,
made
jokes
with
them
,
tried
to
swindle
them
,
and
*NL*
bullied
them
.
Mrs.
Morel
went
up
her
yard
disdainfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
understood
thing
that
if
one
woman
wanted
her
neighbour
,
she
*NL*
should
put
the
poker
in
the
fire
and
bang
at
the
back
of
the
fireplace
,
*NL*
which
,
as
the
fires
were
back
to
back
,
would
make
a
great
noise
in
the
*NL*
adjoining
house
.
One
morning
Mrs.
Kirk
,
mixing
a
pudding
,
nearly
started
*NL*
out
of
her
skin
as
she
heard
the
thud
,
thud
,
in
her
grate
.
With
her
*NL*
hands
all
floury
,
she
rushed
to
the
fence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
knock
,
Mrs.
Morel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
n't
mind
,
Mrs.
Kirk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Kirk
climbed
on
to
her
copper
,
got
over
the
wall
on
to
Mrs.
Morel
's
*NL*
copper
,
and
ran
in
to
her
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
dear
,
how
are
you
feeling
?
''
she
cried
in
concern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
fetch
Mrs.
Bower
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Kirk
went
into
the
yard
,
lifted
up
her
strong
,
shrill
voice
,
and
*NL*
called
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ag-gie
--
Ag-gie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
was
heard
from
one
end
of
the
Bottoms
to
the
other
.
At
last
*NL*
Aggie
came
running
up
,
and
was
sent
for
Mrs.
Bower
,
whilst
Mrs.
Kirk
*NL*
left
her
pudding
and
stayed
with
her
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
went
to
bed
.
Mrs.
Kirk
had
Annie
and
William
for
dinner
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Bower
,
fat
and
waddling
,
bossed
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hash
some
cold
meat
up
for
the
master
's
dinner
,
and
make
him
an
*NL*
apple-charlotte
pudding
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
may
go
without
pudding
this
day
,
''
said
Mrs.
Bower
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
was
not
as
a
rule
one
of
the
first
to
appear
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
pit
,
ready
to
come
up
.
Some
men
were
there
before
four
o'clock
,
when
the
*NL*
whistle
blew
loose-all
;
but
Morel
,
whose
stall
,
a
poor
one
,
was
at
this
*NL*
time
about
a
mile
and
a
half
away
from
the
bottom
,
worked
usually
till
*NL*
the
first
mate
stopped
,
then
he
finished
also
.
This
day
,
however
,
the
*NL*
miner
was
sick
of
the
work
.
At
two
o'clock
he
looked
at
his
watch
,
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
green
candle
--
he
was
in
a
safe
working
--
and
again
at
*NL*
half-past
two
.
He
was
hewing
at
a
piece
of
rock
that
was
in
the
way
for
*NL*
the
next
day
's
work
.
As
he
sat
on
his
heels
,
or
kneeled
,
giving
hard
*NL*
blows
with
his
pick
,
``
Uszza
--
uszza
!
''
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
ter
finish
,
Sorry
?
''
cried
Barker
,
his
fellow
butty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finish
?
Niver
while
the
world
stands
!
''
growled
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
on
striking
.
He
was
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
heart-breaking
job
,
''
said
Barker
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Morel
was
too
exasperated
,
at
the
end
of
his
tether
,
to
answer
.
*NL*
Still
he
struck
and
hacked
with
all
his
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
might
as
well
leave
it
,
Walter
,
''
said
Barker
.
``
It
'll
do
to-morrow
,
*NL*
without
thee
hackin
'
thy
guts
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
lay
no
b
--
finger
on
this
to-morrow
,
Isr
`
el
!
''
cried
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
if
tha
wunna
,
somebody
else
'll
ha'e
to
,
''
said
Israel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Morel
continued
to
strike
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey-up
there
--
LOOSE-A
'
!
''
cried
the
men
,
leaving
the
next
stall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
continued
to
strike
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
'll
happen
catch
me
up
,
''
said
Barker
,
departing
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
gone
,
Morel
,
left
alone
,
felt
savage
.
He
had
not
finished
*NL*
his
job
.
He
had
overworked
himself
into
a
frenzy
.
Rising
,
wet
with
*NL*
sweat
,
he
threw
his
tool
down
,
pulled
on
his
coat
,
blew
out
his
candle
,
*NL*
took
his
lamp
,
and
went
.
Down
the
main
road
the
lights
of
the
other
men
*NL*
went
swinging
.
There
was
a
hollow
sound
of
many
voices
.
It
was
a
long
,
*NL*
heavy
tramp
underground
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
,
where
the
great
drops
of
water
fell
*NL*
plash
.
Many
colliers
were
waiting
their
turns
to
go
up
,
talking
noisily
.
*NL*
Morel
gave
his
answers
short
and
disagreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
rainin
'
,
Sorry
,
''
said
old
Giles
,
who
had
had
the
news
from
the
*NL*
top
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
found
one
comfort
.
He
had
his
old
umbrella
,
which
he
loved
,
in
the
*NL*
lamp
cabin
.
At
last
he
took
his
stand
on
the
chair
,
and
was
at
the
top
*NL*
in
a
moment
.
Then
he
handed
in
his
lamp
and
got
his
umbrella
,
which
he
*NL*
had
bought
at
an
auction
for
one-and-six
.
He
stood
on
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
pit-bank
for
a
moment
,
looking
out
over
the
fields
;
grey
rain
was
*NL*
falling
.
The
trucks
stood
full
of
wet
,
bright
coal
.
Water
ran
down
the
*NL*
sides
of
the
waggons
,
over
the
white
``
C.W.
and
Co.
''
.
Colliers
,
walking
*NL*
indifferent
to
the
rain
,
were
streaming
down
the
line
and
up
the
field
,
*NL*
a
grey
,
dismal
host
.
Morel
put
up
his
umbrella
,
and
took
pleasure
from
*NL*
the
peppering
of
the
drops
thereon
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
along
the
road
to
Bestwood
the
miners
tramped
,
wet
and
grey
and
*NL*
dirty
,
but
their
red
mouths
talking
with
animation
.
Morel
also
walked
*NL*
with
a
gang
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
He
frowned
peevishly
as
he
went
.
Many
*NL*
men
passed
into
the
Prince
of
Wales
or
into
Ellen
's
.
Morel
,
feeling
*NL*
sufficiently
disagreeable
to
resist
temptation
,
trudged
along
under
*NL*
the
dripping
trees
that
overhung
the
park
wall
,
and
down
the
mud
of
*NL*
Greenhill
Lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
lay
in
bed
,
listening
to
the
rain
,
and
the
feet
of
the
*NL*
colliers
from
Minton
,
their
voices
,
and
the
bang
,
bang
of
the
gates
as
*NL*
they
went
through
the
stile
up
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
some
herb
beer
behind
the
pantry
door
,
''
she
said
.
``
Th
'
*NL*
master
'll
want
a
drink
,
if
he
does
n't
stop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
late
,
so
she
concluded
he
had
called
for
a
drink
,
since
it
*NL*
was
raining
.
What
did
he
care
about
the
child
or
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
ill
when
her
children
were
born
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
she
asked
,
feeling
sick
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
took
consolation
in
that
.
The
thought
of
being
the
mother
of
men
*NL*
was
warming
to
her
heart
.
She
looked
at
the
child
.
It
had
blue
eyes
,
*NL*
and
a
lot
of
fair
hair
,
and
was
bonny
.
Her
love
came
up
hot
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
everything
.
She
had
it
in
bed
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
,
thinking
nothing
,
dragged
his
way
up
the
garden
path
,
wearily
*NL*
and
angrily
.
He
closed
his
umbrella
,
and
stood
it
in
the
sink
;
then
he
*NL*
sluthered
his
heavy
boots
into
the
kitchen
.
Mrs.
Bower
appeared
in
the
*NL*
inner
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
``
she
's
about
as
bad
as
she
can
be
.
It
's
a
boy
childt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
miner
grunted
,
put
his
empty
snap-bag
and
his
tin
bottle
on
the
*NL*
dresser
,
went
back
into
the
scullery
and
hung
up
his
coat
,
then
came
and
*NL*
dropped
into
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Han
yer
got
a
drink
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
went
into
the
pantry
.
There
was
heard
the
pop
of
a
cork
.
She
*NL*
set
the
mug
,
with
a
little
,
disgusted
rap
,
on
the
table
before
Morel
.
He
*NL*
drank
,
gasped
,
wiped
his
big
moustache
on
the
end
of
his
scarf
,
drank
,
*NL*
gasped
,
and
lay
back
in
his
chair
.
The
woman
would
not
speak
to
him
*NL*
again
.
She
set
his
dinner
before
him
,
and
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
that
the
master
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
gave
him
his
dinner
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Bower
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
sat
with
his
arms
on
the
table
--
he
resented
the
fact
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Bower
put
no
cloth
on
for
him
,
and
gave
him
a
little
plate
,
instead
*NL*
of
a
full-sized
dinner-plate
--
he
began
to
eat
.
The
fact
that
his
wife
*NL*
was
ill
,
that
he
had
another
boy
,
was
nothing
to
him
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
He
was
too
tired
;
he
wanted
his
dinner
;
he
wanted
to
sit
with
his
arms
*NL*
lying
on
the
board
;
he
did
not
like
having
Mrs.
Bower
about
.
The
fire
*NL*
was
too
small
to
please
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
finished
his
meal
,
he
sat
for
twenty
minutes
;
then
he
*NL*
stoked
up
a
big
fire
.
Then
,
in
his
stockinged
feet
,
he
went
reluctantly
*NL*
upstairs
.
It
was
a
struggle
to
face
his
wife
at
this
moment
,
and
he
was
*NL*
tired
.
His
face
was
black
,
and
smeared
with
sweat
.
His
singlet
had
*NL*
dried
again
,
soaking
the
dirt
in
.
He
had
a
dirty
woollen
scarf
round
his
*NL*
throat
.
So
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
how
are
ter
,
then
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
be
all
right
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
at
a
loss
what
to
say
next
.
He
was
tired
,
and
this
bother
was
*NL*
rather
a
nuisance
to
him
,
and
he
did
n't
quite
know
where
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lad
,
tha
says
,
''
he
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
down
the
sheet
and
showed
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
him
!
''
he
murmured
.
Which
made
her
laugh
,
because
he
blessed
by
*NL*
rote
--
pretending
paternal
emotion
,
which
he
did
not
feel
just
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
now
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
my
lass
,
''
he
answered
,
turning
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dismissed
,
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
,
but
he
dared
not
.
She
half
wanted
*NL*
him
to
kiss
her
,
but
could
not
bring
herself
to
give
any
sign
.
She
only
*NL*
breathed
freely
when
he
was
gone
out
of
the
room
again
,
leaving
behind
*NL*
him
a
faint
smell
of
pit-dirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
had
a
visit
every
day
from
the
Congregational
clergyman
.
Mr.
*NL*
Heaton
was
young
,
and
very
poor
.
His
wife
had
died
at
the
birth
of
his
*NL*
first
baby
,
so
he
remained
alone
in
the
manse
.
He
was
a
Bachelor
of
Arts
*NL*
of
Cambridge
,
very
shy
,
and
no
preacher
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
fond
of
him
,
and
*NL*
he
depended
on
her
.
For
hours
he
talked
to
her
,
when
she
was
well
.
He
*NL*
became
the
god-parent
of
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
the
minister
stayed
to
tea
with
Mrs.
Morel
.
Then
she
laid
*NL*
the
cloth
early
,
got
out
her
best
cups
,
with
a
little
green
rim
,
and
*NL*
hoped
Morel
would
not
come
too
soon
;
indeed
,
if
he
stayed
for
a
pint
,
*NL*
she
would
not
mind
this
day
.
She
had
always
two
dinners
to
cook
,
because
*NL*
she
believed
children
should
have
their
chief
meal
at
midday
,
whereas
*NL*
Morel
needed
his
at
five
o'clock
.
So
Mr.
Heaton
would
hold
the
baby
,
*NL*
whilst
Mrs.
Morel
beat
up
a
batter-pudding
or
peeled
the
potatoes
,
and
*NL*
he
,
watching
her
all
the
time
,
would
discuss
his
next
sermon
.
His
ideas
*NL*
were
quaint
and
fantastic
.
She
brought
him
judiciously
to
earth
.
It
was
*NL*
a
discussion
of
the
wedding
at
Cana
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
He
changed
the
water
into
wine
at
Cana
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
is
a
*NL*
symbol
that
the
ordinary
life
,
even
the
blood
,
of
the
married
husband
*NL*
and
wife
,
which
had
before
been
uninspired
,
like
water
,
became
filled
*NL*
with
the
Spirit
,
and
was
as
wine
,
because
,
when
love
enters
,
the
whole
*NL*
spiritual
constitution
of
a
man
changes
,
is
filled
with
the
Holy
Ghost
,
*NL*
and
almost
his
form
is
altered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
thought
to
herself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
poor
fellow
,
his
young
wife
is
dead
;
that
is
why
he
makes
his
love
*NL*
into
the
Holy
Ghost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
halfway
down
their
first
cup
of
tea
when
they
heard
the
*NL*
sluther
of
pit-boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Morel
,
in
spite
of
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
looked
rather
scared
.
Morel
entered
.
He
was
feeling
rather
*NL*
savage
.
He
nodded
a
``
How
d'yer
do
''
to
the
clergyman
,
who
rose
to
shake
*NL*
hands
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Morel
,
showing
his
hand
,
``
look
thee
at
it
!
Tha
niver
*NL*
wants
ter
shake
hands
wi
'
a
hand
like
that
,
does
ter
?
There
's
too
much
*NL*
pick-haft
and
shovel-dirt
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
flushed
with
confusion
,
and
sat
down
again
.
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
rose
,
carried
out
the
steaming
saucepan
.
Morel
took
off
his
coat
,
*NL*
dragged
his
armchair
to
table
,
and
sat
down
heavily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
tired
?
''
asked
the
clergyman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tired
?
I
ham
that
,
''
replied
Morel
.
``
YOU
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
be
*NL*
tired
,
as
I
'M
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
clergyman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
look
yer
`
ere
,
''
said
the
miner
,
showing
the
shoulders
of
his
*NL*
singlet
.
``
It
's
a
bit
dry
now
,
but
it
's
wet
as
a
clout
with
sweat
even
*NL*
yet
.
Feel
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
Mr.
Heaton
does
n't
want
to
feel
your
*NL*
nasty
singlet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clergyman
put
out
his
hand
gingerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
perhaps
he
does
n't
,
''
said
Morel
;
``
but
it
's
all
come
out
of
me

*NL*

the
pit

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
you
drank
all
the
beer

said
Mrs.
Morel
,
pouring
out
his
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An

was
there
no
more
to
be
got
?
''
Turning
to
the
clergyman
--
``
A
man

*NL*
that
caked
up
wi
'
th
'
dust
,
you
know

--
that

up
down
a
coal-mine
,
*NL*
he
NEEDS
a
drink
when
he
comes
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
he
does

''
said
the
clergyman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
ten
to
one
if
there
's
owt
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
water
--
and
there
's
tea
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Water
!
It
's
not
water
as
'll
clear
his
throat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
poured
out
a
saucerful
of
tea
,
blew
it
,
and
sucked
it
up
through
his
*NL*
great
black
moustache
,
sighing
afterwards
.
Then
he
poured
out
another
*NL*
saucerful
,
and
stood
his
cup
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cloth
!
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
putting
it
on
a
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
as
comes
home
as
I
do
's
too
tired
to
care
about
cloths
,
''
said
*NL*
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pity
!
''
exclaimed
his
wife
,
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
full
of
the
smell
of
meat
and
vegetables
and
pit-clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
over
to
the
minister
,
his
great
moustache
thrust
forward
,
his
*NL*
mouth
very
red
in
his
black
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Heaton
,
''
he
said
,
``
a
man
as
has
been
down
the
black
hole
all
day
,
*NL*
dingin

away
at
a
coal-face

yi
,
a
sight
harder
than
that
wall
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Need
n't
make
a
moan
of
it
,
''
put
in
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hated
her
husband
because
,
whenever
he
had
an
audience
,
he
whined
*NL*
and
played
for
sympathy
.
William
,
sitting
nursing
the
baby
,
hated
him
,
*NL*
with
a
boy
's
hatred
for
false
sentiment
,
and
for
the
stupid
treatment
of
*NL*
his
mother
.
Annie
had
never
liked
him
;
she
merely
avoided
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
minister
had
gone
,
Mrs.
Morel
looked
at
her
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
mess
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dos
'
t
think
I
'm
goin
'
to
sit
wi
'
my
arms
danglin
'
,
cos
tha
's
got
a
*NL*
parson
for
tea
wi
'
thee
?
''
he
bawled
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
angry
,
but
she
said
nothing
.
The
baby
began
to
cry
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
,
picking
up
a
saucepan
from
the
hearth
,
accidentally
knocked
*NL*
Annie
on
the
head
,
whereupon
the
girl
began
to
whine
,
and
Morel
to
shout
*NL*
at
her
.
In
the
midst
of
this
pandemonium
,
William
looked
up
at
the
big
*NL*
glazed
text
over
the
mantelpiece
and
read
distinctly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
Bless
Our
Home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
Mrs.
Morel
,
trying
to
soothe
the
baby
,
jumped
up
,
rushed
at
*NL*
him
,
boxed
his
ears
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
YOU
putting
in
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
sat
down
and
laughed
,
till
tears
ran
over
her
cheeks
,
while
*NL*
William
kicked
the
stool
he
had
been
sitting
on
,
and
Morel
growled
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
canna
see
what
there
is
so
much
to
laugh
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
directly
after
the
parson
's
visit
,
feeling
unable
to
bear
*NL*
herself
after
another
display
from
her
husband
,
she
took
Annie
and
the
*NL*
baby
and
went
out
.
Morel
had
kicked
William
,
and
the
mother
would
never
*NL*
forgive
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
over
the
sheep-bridge
and
across
a
corner
of
the
meadow
to
the
*NL*
cricket-ground
.
The
meadows
seemed
one
space
of
ripe
,
evening
light
,
*NL*
whispering
with
the
distant
mill-race
.
She
sat
on
a
seat
under
the
*NL*
alders
in
the
cricket-ground
,
and
fronted
the
evening
.
Before
her
,
level
*NL*
and
solid
,
spread
the
big
green
cricket-field
,
like
the
bed
of
a
sea
of
*NL*
light
.
Children
played
in
the
bluish
shadow
of
the
pavilion
.
Many
rooks
,
*NL*
high
up
,
came
cawing
home
across
the
softly-woven
sky
.
They
stooped
in
*NL*
a
long
curve
down
into
the
golden
glow
,
concentrating
,
cawing
,
wheeling
,
*NL*
like
black
flakes
on
a
slow
vortex
,
over
a
tree
clump
that
made
a
dark
*NL*
boss
among
the
pasture
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
gentlemen
were
practising
,
and
Mrs.
Morel
could
hear
the
chock
*NL*
of
the
ball
,
and
the
voices
of
men
suddenly
roused
;
could
see
the
white
*NL*
forms
of
men
shifting
silently
over
the
green
,
upon
which
already
the
*NL*
under
shadows
were
smouldering
.
Away
at
the
grange
,
one
side
of
the
*NL*
haystacks
was
lit
up
,
the
other
sides
blue-grey
.
A
waggon
of
sheaves
*NL*
rocked
small
across
the
melting
yellow
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
going
down
.
Every
open
evening
,
the
hills
of
Derbyshire
were
*NL*
blazed
over
with
red
sunset
.
Mrs.
Morel
watched
the
sun
sink
from
the
*NL*
glistening
sky
,
leaving
a
soft
flower-blue
overhead
,
while
the
western
*NL*
space
went
red
,
as
if
all
the
fire
had
swum
down
there
,
leaving
the
*NL*
bell
cast
flawless
blue
.
The
mountain-ash
berries
across
the
field
stood
*NL*
fierily
out
from
the
dark
leaves
,
for
a
moment
.
A
few
shocks
of
corn
in
*NL*
a
corner
of
the
fallow
stood
up
as
if
alive
;
she
imagined
them
bowing
;
*NL*
perhaps
her
son
would
be
a
Joseph
.
In
the
east
,
a
mirrored
sunset
*NL*
floated
pink
opposite
the
west
's
scarlet
.
The
big
haystacks
on
the
*NL*
hillside
,
that
butted
into
the
glare
,
went
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Mrs.
Morel
it
was
one
of
those
still
moments
when
the
small
frets
*NL*
vanish
,
and
the
beauty
of
things
stands
out
,
and
she
had
the
peace
and
*NL*
the
strength
to
see
herself
.
Now
and
again
,
a
swallow
cut
close
to
her
.
*NL*
Now
and
again
,
Annie
came
up
with
a
handful
of
alder-currants
.
The
baby
*NL*
was
restless
on
his
mother
's
knee
,
clambering
with
his
hands
at
the
*NL*
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
looked
down
at
him
.
She
had
dreaded
this
baby
like
a
*NL*
catastrophe
,
because
of
her
feeling
for
her
husband
.
And
now
she
felt
*NL*
strangely
towards
the
infant
.
Her
heart
was
heavy
because
of
the
child
,
*NL*
almost
as
if
it
were
unhealthy
,
or
malformed
.
Yet
it
seemed
quite
well
.
*NL*
But
she
noticed
the
peculiar
knitting
of
the
baby
's
brows
,
and
the
*NL*
peculiar
heaviness
of
its
eyes
,
as
if
it
were
trying
to
understand
*NL*
something
that
was
pain
.
She
felt
,
when
she
looked
at
her
child
's
dark
,
*NL*
brooding
pupils
,
as
if
a
burden
were
on
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
looks
as
if
he
was
thinking
about
something
--
quite
sorrowful
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Kirk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
looking
at
him
,
the
heavy
feeling
at
the
mother
's
heart
melted
*NL*
into
passionate
grief
.
She
bowed
over
him
,
and
a
few
tears
shook
swiftly
*NL*
out
of
her
very
heart
.
The
baby
lifted
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lamb
!
''
she
cried
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
that
moment
she
felt
,
in
some
far
inner
place
of
her
soul
,
that
*NL*
she
and
her
husband
were
guilty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
baby
was
looking
up
at
her
.
It
had
blue
eyes
like
her
own
,
but
its
*NL*
look
was
heavy
,
steady
,
as
if
it
had
realised
something
that
had
stunned
*NL*
some
point
of
its
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
arms
lay
the
delicate
baby
.
Its
deep
blue
eyes
,
always
looking
up
*NL*
at
her
unblinking
,
seemed
to
draw
her
innermost
thoughts
out
of
her
.
She
*NL*
no
longer
loved
her
husband
;
she
had
not
wanted
this
child
to
come
,
and
*NL*
there
it
lay
in
her
arms
and
pulled
at
her
heart
.
She
felt
as
if
the
*NL*
navel
string
that
had
connected
its
frail
little
body
with
hers
had
not
*NL*
been
broken
.
A
wave
of
hot
love
went
over
her
to
the
infant
.
She
held
it
*NL*
close
to
her
face
and
breast
.
With
all
her
force
,
with
all
her
soul
she
*NL*
would
make
up
to
it
for
having
brought
it
into
the
world
unloved
.
She
*NL*
would
love
it
all
the
more
now
it
was
here
;
carry
it
in
her
love
.
Its
*NL*
clear
,
knowing
eyes
gave
her
pain
and
fear
.
Did
it
know
all
about
her
?
*NL*
When
it
lay
under
her
heart
,
had
it
been
listening
then
?
Was
there
a
*NL*
reproach
in
the
look
?
She
felt
the
marrow
melt
in
her
bones
,
with
fear
*NL*
and
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
she
was
aware
of
the
sun
lying
red
on
the
rim
of
the
hill
*NL*
opposite
.
She
suddenly
held
up
the
child
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
''
she
said
.
``
Look
,
my
pretty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thrust
the
infant
forward
to
the
crimson
,
throbbing
sun
,
almost
with
*NL*
relief
.
She
saw
him
lift
his
little
fist
.
Then
she
put
him
to
her
bosom
*NL*
again
,
ashamed
almost
of
her
impulse
to
give
him
back
again
whence
he
*NL*
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
lives
,
''
she
thought
to
herself
,
``
what
will
become
of
him
--
what
*NL*
will
he
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
heart
was
anxious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
call
him
Paul
,
''
she
said
suddenly
;
she
knew
not
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
she
went
home
.
A
fine
shadow
was
flung
over
the
deep
green
*NL*
meadow
,
darkening
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
expected
,
she
found
the
house
empty
.
But
Morel
was
home
by
ten
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
that
day
,
at
least
,
ended
peacefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walter
Morel
was
,
at
this
time
,
exceedingly
irritable
.
His
work
seemed
*NL*
to
exhaust
him
.
When
he
came
home
he
did
not
speak
civilly
to
anybody
.
*NL*
If
the
fire
were
rather
low
he
bullied
about
that
;
he
grumbled
about
his
*NL*
dinner
;
if
the
children
made
a
chatter
he
shouted
at
them
in
a
way
that
*NL*
made
their
mother
's
blood
boil
,
and
made
them
hate
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Friday
,
he
was
not
home
by
eleven
o'clock
.
The
baby
was
unwell
,
*NL*
and
was
restless
,
crying
if
he
were
put
down
.
Mrs.
Morel
,
tired
to
*NL*
death
,
and
still
weak
,
was
scarcely
under
control
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
the
nuisance
would
come
,
''
she
said
wearily
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
at
last
sank
down
to
sleep
in
her
arms
.
She
was
too
tired
to
*NL*
carry
him
to
the
cradle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'll
say
nothing
,
whatever
time
he
comes
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
only
works
*NL*
me
up
;
I
wo
n't
say
anything
.
But
I
know
if
he
does
anything
it
'll
make
*NL*
my
blood
boil
,
''
she
added
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sighed
,
hearing
him
coming
,
as
if
it
were
something
she
could
not
*NL*
bear
.
He
,
taking
his
revenge
,
was
nearly
drunk
.
She
kept
her
head
*NL*
bent
over
the
child
as
he
entered
,
not
wishing
to
see
him
.
But
it
*NL*
went
through
her
like
a
flash
of
hot
fire
when
,
in
passing
,
he
lurched
*NL*
against
the
dresser
,
setting
the
tins
rattling
,
and
clutched
at
the
*NL*
white
pot
knobs
for
support
.
He
hung
up
his
hat
and
coat
,
then
returned
,
*NL*
stood
glowering
from
a
distance
at
her
,
as
she
sat
bowed
over
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
nothing
to
eat
in
the
house
?
''
he
asked
,
insolently
,
as
if
to
a
*NL*
servant
.
In
certain
stages
of
his
intoxication
he
affected
the
*NL*
clipped
,
mincing
speech
of
the
towns
.
Mrs.
Morel
hated
him
most
in
this
*NL*
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
there
is
in
the
house
,
''
she
said
,
so
coldly
,
it
sounded
*NL*
impersonal
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
and
glared
at
her
without
moving
a
muscle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
a
civil
question
,
and
I
expect
a
civil
answer
,
''
he
said
*NL*
affectedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
got
it
,
''
she
said
,
still
ignoring
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glowered
again
.
Then
he
came
unsteadily
forward
.
He
leaned
on
the
*NL*
table
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
other
jerked
at
the
table
drawer
to
*NL*
get
a
knife
to
cut
bread
.
The
drawer
stuck
because
he
pulled
sideways
.
*NL*
In
a
temper
he
dragged
it
,
so
that
it
flew
out
bodily
,
and
spoons
,
*NL*
forks
,
knives
,
a
hundred
metallic
things
,
splashed
with
a
clatter
and
a
*NL*
clang
upon
the
brick
floor
.
The
baby
gave
a
little
convulsed
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
,
clumsy
,
drunken
fool
?
''
the
mother
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
tha
should
get
the
flamin
'
thing
thysen
.
Tha
should
get
up
,
like
*NL*
other
women
have
to
,
an
'
wait
on
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
on
you
--
wait
on
you
?
''
she
cried
.
``
Yes
,
I
see
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yis
,
an
'
I
'll
learn
thee
tha
's
got
to
.
Wait
on
ME
,
yes
tha
sh
`
lt
wait
*NL*
on
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
milord
.
I
'd
wait
on
a
dog
at
the
door
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
trying
to
fit
in
the
drawer
.
At
her
last
speech
he
turned
round
.
*NL*
His
face
was
crimson
,
his
eyes
bloodshot
.
He
stared
at
her
one
silent
*NL*
second
in
threat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
P-h
!
''
she
went
quickly
,
in
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jerked
at
the
drawer
in
his
excitement
.
It
fell
,
cut
sharply
on
his
*NL*
shin
,
and
on
the
reflex
he
flung
it
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
corners
caught
her
brow
as
the
shallow
drawer
crashed
into
*NL*
the
fireplace
.
She
swayed
,
almost
fell
stunned
from
her
chair
.
To
her
*NL*
very
soul
she
was
sick
;
she
clasped
the
child
tightly
to
her
bosom
.
A
*NL*
few
moments
elapsed
;
then
,
with
an
effort
,
she
brought
herself
to
.
*NL*
The
baby
was
crying
plaintively
.
Her
left
brow
was
bleeding
rather
*NL*
profusely
.
As
she
glanced
down
at
the
child
,
her
brain
reeling
,
some
*NL*
drops
of
blood
soaked
into
its
white
shawl
;
but
the
baby
was
at
least
*NL*
not
hurt
.
She
balanced
her
head
to
keep
equilibrium
,
so
that
the
blood
*NL*
ran
into
her
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walter
Morel
remained
as
he
had
stood
,
leaning
on
the
table
with
one
*NL*
hand
,
looking
blank
.
When
he
was
sufficiently
sure
of
his
balance
,
*NL*
he
went
across
to
her
,
swayed
,
caught
hold
of
the
back
of
her
*NL*
rocking-chair
,
almost
tipping
her
out
;
then
leaning
forward
over
her
,
*NL*
and
swaying
as
he
spoke
,
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
wondering
concern
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
it
catch
thee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
swayed
again
,
as
if
he
would
pitch
on
to
the
child
.
With
the
*NL*
catastrophe
he
had
lost
all
balance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
''
she
said
,
struggling
to
keep
her
presence
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hiccoughed
.
``
Let
's
--
let
's
look
at
it
,
''
he
said
,
hiccoughing
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lem
me
--
lem
me
look
at
it
,
lass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smelled
him
of
drink
,
felt
the
unequal
pull
of
his
swaying
grasp
on
*NL*
the
back
of
her
rocking-chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
''
she
said
,
and
weakly
she
pushed
him
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
,
uncertain
in
balance
,
gazing
upon
her
.
Summoning
all
her
*NL*
strength
she
rose
,
the
baby
on
one
arm
.
By
a
cruel
effort
of
will
,
*NL*
moving
as
if
in
sleep
,
she
went
across
to
the
scullery
,
where
she
bathed
*NL*
her
eye
for
a
minute
in
cold
water
;
but
she
was
too
dizzy
.
Afraid
lest
*NL*
she
should
swoon
,
she
returned
to
her
rocking-chair
,
trembling
in
every
*NL*
fibre
.
By
instinct
,
she
kept
the
baby
clasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
,
bothered
,
had
succeeded
in
pushing
the
drawer
back
into
its
*NL*
cavity
,
and
was
on
his
knees
,
groping
,
with
numb
paws
,
for
the
scattered
*NL*
spoons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brow
was
still
bleeding
.
Presently
Morel
got
up
and
came
craning
his
*NL*
neck
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
it
done
to
thee
,
lass
?
''
he
asked
,
in
a
very
wretched
,
humble
*NL*
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
see
what
it
's
done
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
,
bending
forward
,
supported
on
his
hands
,
which
grasped
his
*NL*
legs
just
above
the
knee
.
He
peered
to
look
at
the
wound
.
She
drew
away
*NL*
from
the
thrust
of
his
face
with
its
great
moustache
,
averting
her
*NL*
own
face
as
much
as
possible
.
As
he
looked
at
her
,
who
was
cold
and
*NL*
impassive
as
stone
,
with
mouth
shut
tight
,
he
sickened
with
feebleness
*NL*
and
hopelessness
of
spirit
.
He
was
turning
drearily
away
,
when
he
saw
*NL*
a
drop
of
blood
fall
from
the
averted
wound
into
the
baby
's
fragile
,
*NL*
glistening
hair
.
Fascinated
,
he
watched
the
heavy
dark
drop
hang
in
*NL*
the
glistening
cloud
,
and
pull
down
the
gossamer
.
Another
drop
fell
.
It
*NL*
would
soak
through
to
the
baby
's
scalp
.
He
watched
,
fascinated
,
feeling
*NL*
it
soak
in
;
then
,
finally
,
his
manhood
broke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
this
child
?
''
was
all
his
wife
said
to
him
.
But
her
low
,
intense
*NL*
tones
brought
his
head
lower
.
She
softened
:
``
Get
me
some
wadding
out
of
*NL*
the
middle
drawer
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stumbled
away
very
obediently
,
presently
returning
with
a
pad
,
which
*NL*
she
singed
before
the
fire
,
then
put
on
her
forehead
,
as
she
sat
with
*NL*
the
baby
on
her
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
clean
pit-scarf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
rummaged
and
fumbled
in
the
drawer
,
returning
presently
with
a
*NL*
red
,
narrow
scarf
.
She
took
it
,
and
with
trembling
fingers
proceeded
to
*NL*
bind
it
round
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
tie
it
for
thee
,
''
he
said
humbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
do
it
myself
,
''
she
replied
.
When
it
was
done
she
went
upstairs
,
*NL*
telling
him
to
rake
the
fire
and
lock
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Mrs.
Morel
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knocked
against
the
latch
of
the
coal-place
,
when
I
was
getting
a
*NL*
raker
in
the
dark
,
because
the
candle
blew
out
.
''
Her
two
small
children
*NL*
looked
up
at
her
with
wide
,
dismayed
eyes
.
They
said
nothing
,
but
their
*NL*
parted
lips
seemed
to
express
the
unconscious
tragedy
they
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Walter
Morel
lay
in
bed
next
day
until
nearly
dinner-time
.
He
did
not
*NL*
think
of
the
previous
evening
's
work
.
He
scarcely
thought
of
anything
,
*NL*
but
he
would
not
think
of
that
.
He
lay
and
suffered
like
a
sulking
dog
.
*NL*
He
had
hurt
himself
most
;
and
he
was
the
more
damaged
because
he
would
*NL*
never
say
a
word
to
her
,
or
express
his
sorrow
.
He
tried
to
wriggle
out
*NL*
of
it
.
``
It
was
her
own
fault
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
Nothing
,
however
,
*NL*
could
prevent
his
inner
consciousness
inflicting
on
him
the
punishment
*NL*
which
ate
into
his
spirit
like
rust
,
and
which
he
could
only
alleviate
*NL*
by
drinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
as
if
he
had
not
the
initiative
to
get
up
,
or
to
say
a
word
,
or
*NL*
to
move
,
but
could
only
lie
like
a
log
.
Moreover
,
he
had
himself
violent
*NL*
pains
in
the
head
.
It
was
Saturday
.
Towards
noon
he
rose
,
cut
himself
*NL*
food
in
the
pantry
,
ate
it
with
his
head
dropped
,
then
pulled
on
his
*NL*
boots
,
and
went
out
,
to
return
at
three
o'clock
slightly
tipsy
and
*NL*
relieved
;
then
once
more
straight
to
bed
.
He
rose
again
at
six
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
had
tea
and
went
straight
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sunday
was
the
same
:
bed
till
noon
,
the
Palmerston
Arms
till
2.30
,
*NL*
dinner
,
and
bed
;
scarcely
a
word
spoken
.
When
Mrs.
Morel
went
upstairs
,
*NL*
towards
four
o'clock
,
to
put
on
her
Sunday
dress
,
he
was
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
She
would
have
felt
sorry
for
him
,
if
he
had
once
said
,
``
Wife
,
I
'm
*NL*
sorry
.
''
But
no
;
he
insisted
to
himself
it
was
her
fault
.
And
so
he
*NL*
broke
himself
.
So
she
merely
left
him
alone
.
There
was
this
deadlock
of
*NL*
passion
between
them
,
and
she
was
stronger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
began
tea
.
Sunday
was
the
only
day
when
all
sat
down
to
meals
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
my
father
going
to
get
up
?
''
asked
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
lie
,
''
the
mother
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
feeling
of
misery
over
all
the
house
.
The
children
breathed
*NL*
the
air
that
was
poisoned
,
and
they
felt
dreary
.
They
were
rather
*NL*
disconsolate
,
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
what
to
play
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
Morel
woke
he
got
straight
out
of
bed
.
That
was
*NL*
characteristic
of
him
all
his
life
.
He
was
all
for
activity
.
The
*NL*
prostrated
inactivity
of
two
mornings
was
stifling
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
near
six
o'clock
when
he
got
down
.
This
time
he
entered
without
*NL*
hesitation
,
his
wincing
sensitiveness
having
hardened
again
.
He
did
not
*NL*
care
any
longer
what
the
family
thought
or
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tea-things
were
on
the
table
.
William
was
reading
aloud
from
``
The
*NL*
Child
's
Own
''
,
Annie
listening
and
asking
eternally
``
why
?
''
Both
children
*NL*
hushed
into
silence
as
they
heard
the
approaching
thud
of
their
father
's
*NL*
stockinged
feet
,
and
shrank
as
he
entered
.
Yet
he
was
usually
indulgent
*NL*
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
made
the
meal
alone
,
brutally
.
He
ate
and
drank
more
noisily
than
*NL*
he
had
need
.
No
one
spoke
to
him
.
The
family
life
withdrew
,
shrank
*NL*
away
,
and
became
hushed
as
he
entered
.
But
he
cared
no
longer
about
his
*NL*
alienation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
he
had
finished
tea
he
rose
with
alacrity
to
go
out
.
It
was
*NL*
this
alacrity
,
this
haste
to
be
gone
,
which
so
sickened
Mrs.
Morel
.
As
*NL*
she
heard
him
sousing
heartily
in
cold
water
,
heard
the
eager
scratch
*NL*
of
the
steel
comb
on
the
side
of
the
bowl
,
as
he
wetted
his
hair
,
she
*NL*
closed
her
eyes
in
disgust
.
As
he
bent
over
,
lacing
his
boots
,
there
*NL*
was
a
certain
vulgar
gusto
in
his
movement
that
divided
him
from
the
*NL*
reserved
,
watchful
rest
of
the
family
.
He
always
ran
away
from
the
*NL*
battle
with
himself
.
Even
in
his
own
heart
's
privacy
,
he
excused
*NL*
himself
,
saying
,
``
If
she
had
n't
said
so-and-so
,
it
would
never
have
*NL*
happened
.
She
asked
for
what
she
's
got
.
''
The
children
waited
in
*NL*
restraint
during
his
preparations
.
When
he
had
gone
,
they
sighed
with
*NL*
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
the
door
behind
him
,
and
was
glad
.
It
was
a
rainy
evening
.
The
*NL*
Palmerston
would
be
the
cosier
.
He
hastened
forward
in
anticipation
.
All
*NL*
the
slate
roofs
of
the
Bottoms
shone
black
with
wet
.
The
roads
,
always
*NL*
dark
with
coal-dust
,
were
full
of
blackish
mud
.
He
hastened
along
.
The
*NL*
Palmerston
windows
were
steamed
over
.
The
passage
was
paddled
with
wet
*NL*
feet
.
But
the
air
was
warm
,
if
foul
,
and
full
of
the
sound
of
voices
and
*NL*
the
smell
of
beer
and
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shollt
ha'e
,
Walter
?
''
cried
a
voice
,
as
soon
as
Morel
appeared
in
*NL*
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Jim
,
my
lad
,
wheriver
has
thee
sprung
frae
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
made
a
seat
for
him
,
and
took
him
in
warmly
.
He
was
glad
.
In
a
*NL*
minute
or
two
they
had
thawed
all
responsibility
out
of
him
,
all
shame
,
*NL*
all
trouble
,
and
he
was
clear
as
a
bell
for
a
jolly
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Wednesday
following
,
Morel
was
penniless
.
He
dreaded
his
wife
.
*NL*
Having
hurt
her
,
he
hated
her
.
He
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
*NL*
himself
that
evening
,
having
not
even
twopence
with
which
to
go
to
the
*NL*
Palmerston
,
and
being
already
rather
deeply
in
debt
.
So
,
while
his
wife
*NL*
was
down
the
garden
with
the
child
,
he
hunted
in
the
top
drawer
of
*NL*
the
dresser
where
she
kept
her
purse
,
found
it
,
and
looked
inside
.
It
*NL*
contained
a
half-crown
,
two
halfpennies
,
and
a
sixpence
.
So
he
took
the
*NL*
sixpence
,
put
the
purse
carefully
back
,
and
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
when
she
wanted
to
pay
the
greengrocer
,
she
looked
in
the
*NL*
purse
for
her
sixpence
,
and
her
heart
sank
to
her
shoes
.
Then
she
sat
*NL*
down
and
thought
:
``
WAS
there
a
sixpence
?
I
had
n't
spent
it
,
had
I
?
And
I
*NL*
had
n't
left
it
anywhere
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
much
put
about
.
She
hunted
round
everywhere
for
it
.
And
,
as
she
*NL*
sought
,
the
conviction
came
into
her
heart
that
her
husband
had
taken
*NL*
it
.
What
she
had
in
her
purse
was
all
the
money
she
possessed
.
But
that
*NL*
he
should
sneak
it
from
her
thus
was
unbearable
.
He
had
done
so
twice
*NL*
before
.
The
first
time
she
had
not
accused
him
,
and
at
the
week-end
he
*NL*
had
put
the
shilling
again
into
her
purse
.
So
that
was
how
she
had
known
*NL*
he
had
taken
it
.
The
second
time
he
had
not
paid
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
she
felt
it
was
too
much
.
When
he
had
had
his
dinner
--
he
came
*NL*
home
early
that
day
--
she
said
to
him
coldly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
take
sixpence
out
of
my
purse
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
''
he
said
,
looking
up
in
an
offended
way
.
``
No
,
I
didna
!
I
niver
*NL*
clapped
eyes
on
your
purse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
could
detect
the
lie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
know
you
did
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
I
didna
,
''
he
shouted
.
``
Yer
at
me
again
,
are
yer
?
I
've
had
*NL*
about
enough
o
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
filch
sixpence
out
of
my
purse
while
I
'm
taking
the
clothes
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
may
yer
pay
for
this
,
''
he
said
,
pushing
back
his
chair
in
*NL*
desperation
.
He
bustled
and
got
washed
,
then
went
determinedly
upstairs
.
*NL*
Presently
he
came
down
dressed
,
and
with
a
big
bundle
in
a
blue-checked
,
*NL*
enormous
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
'll
see
me
again
when
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
be
before
I
want
to
,
''
she
replied
;
and
at
that
he
marched
out
*NL*
of
the
house
with
his
bundle
.
She
sat
trembling
slightly
,
but
her
heart
*NL*
brimming
with
contempt
.
What
would
she
do
if
he
went
to
some
other
*NL*
pit
,
obtained
work
,
and
got
in
with
another
woman
?
But
she
knew
him
too
*NL*
well
--
he
could
n't
.
She
was
dead
sure
of
him
.
Nevertheless
her
heart
was
*NL*
gnawed
inside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
my
dad
?
''
said
William
,
coming
in
from
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
he
's
run
away
,
''
replied
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
He
's
taken
a
bundle
in
the
blue
handkerchief
,
and
*NL*
says
he
's
not
coming
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
do
?
''
cried
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
never
trouble
,
he
wo
n't
go
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
he
does
n't
come
back
,
''
wailed
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
and
William
retired
to
the
sofa
and
wept
.
Mrs.
Morel
sat
and
*NL*
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
pair
of
gabeys
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
You
'll
see
him
before
the
night
's
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
children
were
not
to
be
consoled
.
Twilight
came
on
.
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
grew
anxious
from
very
weariness
.
One
part
of
her
said
it
would
be
a
*NL*
relief
to
see
the
last
of
him
;
another
part
fretted
because
of
keeping
*NL*
the
children
;
and
inside
her
,
as
yet
,
she
could
not
quite
let
him
go
.
At
*NL*
the
bottom
,
she
knew
very
well
he
could
NOT
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
down
to
the
coal-place
at
the
end
of
the
garden
,
however
,
*NL*
she
felt
something
behind
the
door
.
So
she
looked
.
And
there
in
the
dark
*NL*
lay
the
big
blue
bundle
.
She
sat
on
a
piece
of
coal
and
laughed
.
Every
*NL*
time
she
saw
it
,
so
fat
and
yet
so
ignominious
,
slunk
into
its
corner
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
with
its
ends
flopping
like
dejected
ears
from
the
knots
,
she
*NL*
laughed
again
.
She
was
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
sat
waiting
.
He
had
not
any
money
,
she
knew
,
so
if
he
stopped
*NL*
he
was
running
up
a
bill
.
She
was
very
tired
of
him
--
tired
to
death
.
He
*NL*
had
not
even
the
courage
to
carry
his
bundle
beyond
the
yard-end
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
meditated
,
at
about
nine
o'clock
,
he
opened
the
door
and
came
in
,
*NL*
slinking
,
and
yet
sulky
.
She
said
not
a
word
.
He
took
off
his
coat
,
and
*NL*
slunk
to
his
armchair
,
where
he
began
to
take
off
his
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
fetch
your
bundle
before
you
take
your
boots
off
,
''
she
*NL*
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
thank
your
stars
I
've
come
back
to-night
,
''
he
said
,
looking
up
*NL*
from
under
his
dropped
head
,
sulkily
,
trying
to
be
impressive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
where
should
you
have
gone
?
You
dare
n't
even
get
your
parcel
*NL*
through
the
yard-end
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
such
a
fool
she
was
not
even
angry
with
him
.
He
continued
to
*NL*
take
his
boots
off
and
prepare
for
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
's
in
your
blue
handkerchief
,
''
she
said
.
``
But
if
you
*NL*
leave
it
the
children
shall
fetch
it
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
he
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
house
,
returning
presently
and
*NL*
crossing
the
kitchen
with
averted
face
,
hurrying
upstairs
.
As
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
saw
him
slink
quickly
through
the
inner
doorway
,
holding
his
bundle
,
she
*NL*
laughed
to
herself
:
but
her
heart
was
bitter
,
because
she
had
loved
him
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
THE
CASTING
OFF
OF
MOREL
--
THE
TAKING
ON
OF
WILLIAM
*NL*
*NL*
DURING
the
next
week
Morel
's
temper
was
almost
unbearable
.
Like
all
*NL*
miners
,
he
was
a
great
lover
of
medicines
,
which
,
strangely
enough
,
he
*NL*
would
often
pay
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mun
get
me
a
drop
o
'
laxy
vitral
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
a
winder
as
we
*NL*
canna
ha'e
a
sup
i
'
th
'
`
ouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Mrs.
Morel
bought
him
elixir
of
vitriol
,
his
favourite
first
*NL*
medicine
.
And
he
made
himself
a
jug
of
wormwood
tea
.
He
had
hanging
in
*NL*
the
attic
great
bunches
of
dried
herbs
:
wormwood
,
rue
,
horehound
,
elder
*NL*
flowers
,
parsley-purt
,
marshmallow
,
hyssop
,
dandelion
,
and
centaury
.
*NL*
Usually
there
was
a
jug
of
one
or
other
decoction
standing
on
the
hob
,
*NL*
from
which
he
drank
largely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grand
!
''
he
said
,
smacking
his
lips
after
wormwood
.
``
Grand
!
''
And
he
*NL*
exhorted
the
children
to
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
better
than
any
of
your
tea
or
your
cocoa
stews
,
''
he
vowed
.
But
*NL*
they
were
not
to
be
tempted
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
,
however
,
neither
pills
nor
vitriol
nor
all
his
herbs
would
*NL*
shift
the
``
nasty
peens
in
his
head
''
.
He
was
sickening
for
an
attack
of
*NL*
an
inflammation
of
the
brain
.
He
had
never
been
well
since
his
sleeping
*NL*
on
the
ground
when
he
went
with
Jerry
to
Nottingham
.
Since
then
he
had
*NL*
drunk
and
stormed
.
Now
he
fell
seriously
ill
,
and
Mrs.
Morel
had
him
*NL*
to
nurse
.
He
was
one
of
the
worst
patients
imaginable
.
But
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
all
,
and
putting
aside
the
fact
that
he
was
breadwinner
,
she
never
*NL*
quite
wanted
him
to
die
.
Still
there
was
one
part
of
her
wanted
him
for
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbours
were
very
good
to
her
:
occasionally
some
had
the
children
*NL*
in
to
meals
,
occasionally
some
would
do
the
downstairs
work
for
her
,
one
*NL*
would
mind
the
baby
for
a
day
.
But
it
was
a
great
drag
,
nevertheless
.
*NL*
It
was
not
every
day
the
neighbours
helped
.
Then
she
had
nursing
of
baby
*NL*
and
husband
,
cleaning
and
cooking
,
everything
to
do
.
She
was
quite
worn
*NL*
out
,
but
she
did
what
was
wanted
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
money
was
just
sufficient
.
She
had
seventeen
shillings
a
week
*NL*
from
clubs
,
and
every
Friday
Barker
and
the
other
butty
put
by
a
portion
*NL*
of
the
stall
's
profits
for
Morel
's
wife
.
And
the
neighbours
made
broths
,
*NL*
and
gave
eggs
,
and
such
invalids
'
trifles
.
If
they
had
not
helped
her
so
*NL*
generously
in
those
times
,
Mrs.
Morel
would
never
have
pulled
through
,
*NL*
without
incurring
debts
that
would
have
dragged
her
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
weeks
passed
.
Morel
,
almost
against
hope
,
grew
better
.
He
had
a
fine
*NL*
constitution
,
so
that
,
once
on
the
mend
,
he
went
straight
forward
to
*NL*
recovery
.
Soon
he
was
pottering
about
downstairs
.
During
his
illness
his
*NL*
wife
had
spoilt
him
a
little
.
Now
he
wanted
her
to
continue
.
He
often
*NL*
put
his
band
to
his
head
,
pulled
down
the
corners
of
his
mouth
,
and
*NL*
shammed
pains
he
did
not
feel
.
But
there
was
no
deceiving
her
.
At
first
*NL*
she
merely
smiled
to
herself
.
Then
she
scolded
him
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
,
man
,
do
n't
be
so
lachrymose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
wounded
him
slightly
,
but
still
he
continued
to
feign
sickness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
be
such
a
mardy
baby
,
''
said
the
wife
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
was
indignant
,
and
cursed
under
his
breath
,
like
a
boy
.
He
was
*NL*
forced
to
resume
a
normal
tone
,
and
to
cease
to
whine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
there
was
a
state
of
peace
in
the
house
for
some
time
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
was
more
tolerant
of
him
,
and
he
,
depending
on
her
almost
*NL*
like
a
child
,
was
rather
happy
.
Neither
knew
that
she
was
more
tolerant
*NL*
because
she
loved
him
less
.
Up
till
this
time
,
in
spite
of
all
,
he
had
*NL*
been
her
husband
and
her
man
.
She
had
felt
that
,
more
or
less
,
what
he
*NL*
did
to
himself
he
did
to
her
.
Her
living
depended
on
him
.
There
were
*NL*
many
,
many
stages
in
the
ebbing
of
her
love
for
him
,
but
it
was
always
*NL*
ebbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
with
the
birth
of
this
third
baby
,
her
self
no
longer
set
towards
*NL*
him
,
helplessly
,
but
was
like
a
tide
that
scarcely
rose
,
standing
off
*NL*
from
him
.
After
this
she
scarcely
desired
him
.
And
,
standing
more
aloof
*NL*
from
him
,
not
feeling
him
so
much
part
of
herself
,
but
merely
part
of
*NL*
her
circumstances
,
she
did
not
mind
so
much
what
he
did
,
could
leave
him
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
halt
,
the
wistfulness
about
the
ensuing
year
,
which
*NL*
is
like
autumn
in
a
man
's
life
.
His
wife
was
casting
him
off
,
half
*NL*
regretfully
,
but
relentlessly
;
casting
him
off
and
turning
now
for
love
*NL*
and
life
to
the
children
.
Henceforward
he
was
more
or
less
a
husk
.
And
*NL*
he
himself
acquiesced
,
as
so
many
men
do
,
yielding
their
place
to
their
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
his
recuperation
,
when
it
was
really
over
between
them
,
both
made
*NL*
an
effort
to
come
back
somewhat
to
the
old
relationship
of
the
first
*NL*
months
of
their
marriage
.
He
sat
at
home
and
,
when
the
children
were
in
*NL*
bed
,
and
she
was
sewing
--
she
did
all
her
sewing
by
hand
,
made
all
shirts
*NL*
and
children
's
clothing
--
he
would
read
to
her
from
the
newspaper
,
slowly
*NL*
pronouncing
and
delivering
the
words
like
a
man
pitching
quoits
.
Often
*NL*
she
hurried
him
on
,
giving
him
a
phrase
in
anticipation
.
And
then
he
*NL*
took
her
words
humbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silences
between
them
were
peculiar
.
There
would
be
the
swift
,
*NL*
slight
``
cluck
''
of
her
needle
,
the
sharp
``
pop
''
of
his
lips
as
he
let
out
*NL*
the
smoke
,
the
warmth
,
the
sizzle
on
the
bars
as
he
spat
in
the
fire
.
*NL*
Then
her
thoughts
turned
to
William
.
Already
he
was
getting
a
big
boy
.
*NL*
Already
he
was
top
of
the
class
,
and
the
master
said
he
was
the
smartest
*NL*
lad
in
the
school
.
She
saw
him
a
man
,
young
,
full
of
vigour
,
making
the
*NL*
world
glow
again
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Morel
sitting
there
,
quite
alone
,
and
having
nothing
to
think
about
,
*NL*
would
be
feeling
vaguely
uncomfortable
.
His
soul
would
reach
out
in
its
*NL*
blind
way
to
her
and
find
her
gone
.
He
felt
a
sort
of
emptiness
,
almost
*NL*
like
a
vacuum
in
his
soul
.
He
was
unsettled
and
restless
.
Soon
he
could
*NL*
not
live
in
that
atmosphere
,
and
he
affected
his
wife
.
Both
felt
an
*NL*
oppression
on
their
breathing
when
they
were
left
together
for
some
*NL*
time
.
Then
he
went
to
bed
and
she
settled
down
to
enjoy
herself
alone
,
*NL*
working
,
thinking
,
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
another
infant
was
coming
,
fruit
of
this
little
peace
and
*NL*
tenderness
between
the
separating
parents
.
Paul
was
seventeen
months
old
*NL*
when
the
new
baby
was
born
.
He
was
then
a
plump
,
pale
child
,
quiet
,
with
*NL*
heavy
blue
eyes
,
and
still
the
peculiar
slight
knitting
of
the
brows
.
*NL*
The
last
child
was
also
a
boy
,
fair
and
bonny
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
sorry
when
*NL*
she
knew
she
was
with
child
,
both
for
economic
reasons
and
because
she
*NL*
did
not
love
her
husband
;
but
not
for
the
sake
of
the
infant
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
called
the
baby
Arthur
.
He
was
very
pretty
,
with
a
mop
of
gold
*NL*
curls
,
and
he
loved
his
father
from
the
first
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
glad
this
*NL*
child
loved
the
father
.
Hearing
the
miner
's
footsteps
,
the
baby
would
*NL*
put
up
his
arms
and
crow
.
And
if
Morel
were
in
a
good
temper
,
he
called
*NL*
back
immediately
,
in
his
hearty
,
mellow
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
,
my
beauty
?
I
sh
'll
come
to
thee
in
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
off
his
pit-coat
,
Mrs.
Morel
would
put
an
*NL*
apron
round
the
child
,
and
give
him
to
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
sight
the
lad
looks
!
''
she
would
exclaim
sometimes
,
taking
back
*NL*
the
baby
,
that
was
smutted
on
the
face
from
his
father
's
kisses
and
*NL*
play
.
Then
Morel
laughed
joyfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
little
collier
,
bless
his
bit
o
'
mutton
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
these
were
the
happy
moments
of
her
life
now
,
when
the
children
*NL*
included
the
father
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
William
grew
bigger
and
stronger
and
more
active
,
while
Paul
,
*NL*
always
rather
delicate
and
quiet
,
got
slimmer
,
and
trotted
after
his
*NL*
mother
like
her
shadow
.
He
was
usually
active
and
interested
,
but
*NL*
sometimes
he
would
have
fits
of
depression
.
Then
the
mother
would
find
*NL*
the
boy
of
three
or
four
crying
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
she
asked
,
and
got
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
she
insisted
,
getting
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
sobbed
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
tried
to
reason
him
out
of
it
,
or
to
amuse
him
,
but
without
*NL*
effect
.
It
made
her
feel
beside
herself
.
Then
the
father
,
always
*NL*
impatient
,
would
jump
from
his
chair
and
shout
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
does
n't
stop
,
I
'll
smack
him
till
he
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
do
nothing
of
the
sort
,
''
said
the
mother
coldly
.
And
then
she
*NL*
carried
the
child
into
the
yard
,
plumped
him
into
his
little
chair
,
and
*NL*
said
:
``
Now
cry
there
,
Misery
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
a
butterfly
on
the
rhubarb-leaves
perhaps
caught
his
eye
,
or
*NL*
at
last
he
cried
himself
to
sleep
.
These
fits
were
not
often
,
but
they
*NL*
caused
a
shadow
in
Mrs.
Morel
's
heart
,
and
her
treatment
of
Paul
was
*NL*
different
from
that
of
the
other
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
one
morning
as
she
was
looking
down
the
alley
of
the
Bottoms
*NL*
for
the
barm-man
,
she
heard
a
voice
calling
her
.
It
was
the
thin
little
*NL*
Mrs.
Anthony
in
brown
velvet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Mrs.
Morel
,
I
want
to
tell
you
about
your
Willie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
?
''
replied
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lad
as
gets
`
old
of
another
an
'
rips
his
clothes
off
'n
`
is
back
,
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Anthony
said
,
``
wants
showing
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Alfred
's
as
old
as
my
William
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Appen
'
e
is
,
but
that
does
n't
give
him
a
right
to
get
hold
of
the
*NL*
boy
's
collar
,
an
'
fair
rip
it
clean
off
his
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
I
do
n't
thrash
my
children
,
and
even
if
I
did
,
*NL*
I
should
want
to
hear
their
side
of
the
tale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'd
happen
be
a
bit
better
if
they
did
get
a
good
hiding
,
''
retorted
*NL*
Mrs.
Anthony
.
``
When
it
comes
ter
rippin

a
lad
's
clean
collar
off
'n
`
is
*NL*
back
a-purpose

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
he
did
n't
do
it
on
purpose
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
me
a
liar
!
''
shouted
Mrs.
Anthony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
moved
away
and
closed
her
gate
.
Her
hand
trembled
as
she
held
*NL*
her
mug
of
barm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
s
'll
let
your
mester
know
,
''
Mrs.
Anthony
cried
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dinner-time
,
when
William
had
finished
his
meal
and
wanted
to
be
off
*NL*
again
--
he
was
then
eleven
years
old
--
his
mother
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
tear
Alfred
Anthony
's
collar
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
I
tear
his
collar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
when
,
but
his
mother
says
you
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
it
was
yesterday
--
an
'
it
was
torn
a
`
ready

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
tore
it
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'd
got
a
cobbler
as
`

licked
seventeen

an

Alfy

says
:

*NL*
*NL*
An

so
I
says

an

an

But
I

my
cobbler

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
from
his
pocket
a
black
old
horse-chestnut
hanging
on
a
*NL*
string
.
This
old
cobbler
had
``
cobbled
''
--
hit
and
smashed
--
seventeen
other
*NL*
cobblers
on
similar
strings
.
So
the
boy
was
proud
of
his
veteran
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
you
know
you
've
got
no
right
to
rip
his
*NL*
collar

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

our

!
''
he
answered
.
``
I
never

an

collar
as
was
torn
a
`

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
time

''
said
his
mother
,
``
YOU

I

if

with

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
,
our
mother
;
I
never
did
it
a-purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
was
rather
miserable
at
being
reprimanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
well
,
you
be
more
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
William
fled
away
,
glad
to
be
exonerated
.
And
Mrs.
Morel
,
who
hated
any
*NL*
bother
with
the
neighbours
,
thought
she
would
explain
to
Mrs.
Anthony
,
*NL*
and
the
business
would
be
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
evening
Morel
came
in
from
the
pit
looking
very
sour
.
He
stood
*NL*
in
the
kitchen
and
glared
round
,
but
did
not
speak
for
some
minutes
.
*NL*
Then
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wheer
's
that
Willy
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
HIM
for
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Morel
,
who
had
guessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
let
`
im
know
when
I
get
him
,
''
said
Morel
,
banging
his
pit-bottle
*NL*
on
to
the
dresser
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
Mrs.
Anthony
's
got
hold
of
you
and
been
yarning
to
you
about
*NL*
Alfy
's
collar
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
rather
sneering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Niver
mind
who
's
got
hold
of
me
,
''

Morel

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
poor
tale

said
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
that
you

`
Ripping

repeated
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
He
was
running
*NL*
after
that
Alfy
,
who
'd
taken
his
cobbler
,
and

accidentally
got

of
his
collar
,
because
the
other
dodged
--
as
an
Anthony

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
shouted
Morel
threateningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
,
before
you

''
replied
his
wife
bitingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Niver
you

''
stormed
Morel
.
``
I
know
my
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
more
than
doubtful
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
supposing
some
*NL*
loud-mouthed
creature
had
been
getting
you
to
thrash
your
own
children

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
repeated
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
said
no
more
,
but
sat
and
nursed
his
bad
temper
.
Suddenly
William
*NL*
ran
in
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
have
my
tea
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
can
ha'e
more
than
that
!
''
shouted
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
noise
,
man
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
;
``
and
do
n't
look
so
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
look
ridiculous
before
I
've
done
wi

him
!
''
shouted
Morel
,
rising
*NL*
from
his
chair
and
glaring
at
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
,
who
was
a
tall
lad
for
his
years
,
but
very
sensitive
,
had
gone
*NL*
pale
,
and
was
looking
in
a
sort
of
horror
at
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
out
!
''
Mrs.
Morel
commanded
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
had
not
the
wit
to
move
.
Suddenly
Morel
clenched
his
fist
,
and
*NL*
crouched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
GI'E
him
`
go
out
'
!
''
he
shouted
like
an
insane
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Morel
,
panting
with
rage
.
``
You
shall
not
touch
him
*NL*
for
HER
telling
,
you
shall
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shonna
I
?
''
shouted
Morel
.
``
Shonna
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
glaring
at
the
boy
,
he
ran
forward
.
Mrs.
Morel
sprang
in
between
*NL*
them
,
with
her
fist
lifted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
DARE
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
he
shouted
,
baffled
for
the
moment
.
``
What
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spun
round
to
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
GO
out
of
the
house
!
''
she
commanded
him
in
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
,
as
if
hypnotised
by
her
,
turned
suddenly
and
was
gone
.
Morel
*NL*
rushed
to
the
door
,
but
was
too
late
.
He
returned
,
pale
under
his
*NL*
pit-dirt
with
fury
.
But
now
his
wife
was
fully
roused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
dare
!
''
she
said
in
a
loud
,
ringing
voice
.
``
Only
dare
,
milord
,
to
*NL*
lay
a
finger
on
that
child
!
You
'll
regret
it
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
afraid
of
her
.
In
a
towering
rage
,
he
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
children
were
old
enough
to
be
left
,
Mrs.
Morel
joined
*NL*
the
Women
's
Guild
.
It
was
a
little
club
of
women
attached
to
the
*NL*
Co-operative
Wholesale
Society
,
which
met
on
Monday
night
in
the
long
*NL*
room
over
the
grocery
shop
of
the
Bestwood
``
Co-op
''
.
The
women
were
*NL*
supposed
to
discuss
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
co-operation
,
and
*NL*
other
social
questions
.
Sometimes
Mrs.
Morel
read
a
paper
.
It
seemed
*NL*
queer
to
the
children
to
see
their
mother
,
who
was
always
busy
about
*NL*
the
house
,
sitting
writing
in
her
rapid
fashion
,
thinking
,
referring
*NL*
to
books
,
and
writing
again
.
They
felt
for
her
on
such
occasions
the
*NL*
deepest
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
loved
the
Guild
.
It
was
the
only
thing
to
which
they
did
not
*NL*
grudge
their
mother
--
and
that
partly
because
she
enjoyed
it
,
partly
*NL*
because
of
the
treats
they
derived
from
it
.
The
Guild
was
called
by
some
*NL*
hostile
husbands
,
who
found
their
wives
getting
too
independent
,
the
*NL*
``
clat-fart
''
shop
--
that
is
,
the
gossip-shop
.
It
is
true
,
from
off
*NL*
the
basis
of
the
Guild
,
the
women
could
look
at
their
homes
,
at
the
*NL*
conditions
of
their
own
lives
,
and
find
fault
.
So
the
colliers
found
*NL*
their
women
had
a
new
standard
of
their
own
,
rather
disconcerting
.
And
*NL*
also
,
Mrs.
Morel
always
had
a
lot
of
news
on
Monday
nights
,
so
that
the
*NL*
children
liked
William
to
be
in
when
their
mother
came
home
,
because
she
*NL*
told
him
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
when
the
lad
was
thirteen
,
she
got
him
a
job
in
the
``
Co-op
.
''
*NL*
office
.
He
was
a
very
clever
boy
,
frank
,
with
rather
rough
features
and
*NL*
real
viking
blue
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
``
All

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

Mrs.

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

said
Mrs.
Morel
,
``

there

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If

the
pit
at

,
it
's
no
reason
why
I
*NL*
should
do
the

with

lad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twelve

It
wor
a
sight
afore

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whenever
it
was
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
proud
of
her
son
.
He
went
to
the
night
school
,
and
learned
*NL*
shorthand
,
so
that
by
the
time
he
was
sixteen
he
was
the
best
shorthand
*NL*
clerk
and
book-keeper
on
the
place
,
except
one
.
Then
he
taught
in
the
*NL*
night
schools
.
But
he
was
so
fiery
that
only
his
good-nature
and
his
*NL*
size
protected
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
things
that
men
do
--
the
decent
things
--
William
did
.
He
could
*NL*
run
like
the
wind
.
When
he
was
twelve
he
won
a
first
prize
in
a
race
;
*NL*
an
inkstand
of
glass
,
shaped
like
an
anvil
.
It
stood
proudly
on
the
*NL*
dresser
,
and
gave
Mrs.
Morel
a
keen
pleasure
.
The
boy
only
ran
for
her
.
*NL*
He
flew
home
with
his
anvil
,
breathless
,
with
a
``
Look
,
mother
!
''
That
was
*NL*
the
first
real
tribute
to
herself
.
She
took
it
like
a
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
pretty
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
began
to
get
ambitious
.
He
gave
all
his
money
to
his
mother
.
*NL*
When
he
earned
fourteen
shillings
a
week
,
she
gave
him
back
two
for
*NL*
himself
,
and
,
as
he
never
drank
,
he
felt
himself
rich
.
He
went
about
*NL*
with
the
bourgeois
of
Bestwood
.
The
townlet
contained
nothing
higher
*NL*
than
the
clergyman
.
Then
came
the
bank
manager
,
then
the
doctors
,
then
*NL*
the
tradespeople
,
and
after
that
the
hosts
of
colliers
.
Willam
began
*NL*
to
consort
with
the
sons
of
the
chemist
,
the
schoolmaster
,
and
*NL*
the
tradesmen
.
He
played
billiards
in
the
Mechanics
'
Hall
.
Also
he
*NL*
danced
--
this
in
spite
of
his
mother
.
All
the
life
that
Bestwood
offered
*NL*
he
enjoyed
,
from
the
sixpenny-hops
down
Church
Street
,
to
sports
and
*NL*
billiards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
treated
to
dazzling
descriptions
of
all
kinds
of
flower-like
*NL*
ladies
,
most
of
whom
lived
like
cut
blooms
in
William
's
heart
for
a
*NL*
brief
fortnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
some
flame
would
come
in
pursuit
of
her
errant
swain
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
would
find
a
strange
girl
at
the
door
,
and
immediately
she
sniffed
*NL*
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Morel
in
?
''
the
damsel
would
ask
appealingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
husband
is
at
home
,
''
Mrs.
Morel
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
mean
YOUNG
Mr.
Morel
,
''
repeated
the
maiden
painfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
one
?
There
are
several
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
much
blushing
and
stammering
from
the
fair
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
met
Mr.
Morel
--
at
Ripley
,
''
she
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
at
a
dance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
approve
of
the
girls
my
son
meets
at
dances
.
And
he
is
NOT
at
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
came
home
angry
with
his
mother
for
having
turned
the
girl
away
*NL*
so
rudely
.
He
was
a
careless
,
yet
eager-looking
fellow
,
who
walked
with
*NL*
long
strides
,
sometimes
frowning
,
often
with
his
cap
pushed
jollily
to
*NL*
the
back
of
his
head
.
Now
he
came
in
frowning
.
He
threw
his
cap
on
to
*NL*
the
sofa
,
and
took
his
strong
jaw
in
his
hand
,
and
glared
down
at
*NL*
his
mother
.
She
was
small
,
with
her
hair
taken
straight
back
from
her
*NL*
forehead
.
She
had
a
quiet
air
of
authority
,
and
yet
of
rare
warmth
.
*NL*
Knowing
her
son
was
angry
,
she
trembled
inwardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
a
lady
call
for
me
yesterday
,
mother
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
a
lady
.
There
was
a
girl
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
did
n't
you
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
forgot
,
simply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fumed
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good-looking
girl
--
seemed
a
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
look
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Big
brown
eyes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
NOT
look
.
And
tell
your
girls
,
my
son
,
that
when
they
're
running
*NL*
after
you
,
they
're
not
to
come
and
ask
your
mother
for
you
.
Tell
them
*NL*
that
--
brazen
baggages
you
meet
at
dancing-classes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
she
was
a
nice
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'm
sure
she
was
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
ended
the
altercation
.
Over
the
dancing
there
was
a
great
strife
*NL*
between
the
mother
and
the
son
.
The
grievance
reached
its
height
when
*NL*
William
said
he
was
going
to
Hucknall
Torkard
--
considered
a
low
town
--
to
*NL*
a
fancy-dress
ball
.
He
was
to
be
a
Highlander
.
There
was
a
dress
he
*NL*
could
hire
,
which
one
of
his
friends
had
had
,
and
which
fitted
him
*NL*
perfectly
.
The
Highland
suit
came
home
.
Mrs.
Morel
received
it
coldly
*NL*
and
would
not
unpack
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
suit
come
?
''
cried
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
parcel
in
the
front
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rushed
in
and
cut
the
string
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
fancy
your
son
in
this
!
''
he
said
,
enraptured
,
showing
her
*NL*
the
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
do
n't
want
to
fancy
you
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
dance
,
when
he
had
come
home
to
dress
,
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
put
on
her
coat
and
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
going
to
stop
and
see
me
,
mother
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
do
n't
want
to
see
you
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
rather
pale
,
and
her
face
was
closed
and
hard
.
She
was
afraid
of
*NL*
her
son
's
going
the
same
way
as
his
father
.
He
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
his
heart
stood
still
with
anxiety
.
Then
he
caught
sight
of
the
Highland
*NL*
bonnet
with
its
ribbons
.
He
picked
it
up
gleefully
,
forgetting
her
.
She
*NL*
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
nineteen
he
suddenly
left
the
Co-op
.
office
and
got
a
*NL*
situation
in
Nottingham
.
In
his
new
place
he
had
thirty
shillings
a
week
*NL*
instead
of
eighteen
.
This
was
indeed
a
rise
.
His
mother
and
his
father
*NL*
were
brimmed
up
with
pride
.
Everybody
praised
William
.
It
seemed
he
was
*NL*
going
to
get
on
rapidly
.
Mrs.
Morel
hoped
,
with
his
aid
,
to
help
her
*NL*
younger
sons
.
Annie
was
now
studying
to
be
a
teacher
.
Paul
,
also
very
*NL*
clever
,
was
getting
on
well
,
having
lessons
in
French
and
German
from
*NL*
his
godfather
,
the
clergyman
who
was
still
a
friend
to
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
Arthur
,
a
spoilt
and
very
good-looking
boy
,
was
at
the
Board
school
,
but
*NL*
there
was
talk
of
his
trying
to
get
a
scholarship
for
the
High
School
in
*NL*
Nottingham
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
remained
a
year
at
his
new
post
in
Nottingham
.
He
was
studying
*NL*
hard
,
and
growing
serious
.
Something
seemed
to
be
fretting
him
.
Still
*NL*
he
went
out
to
the
dances
and
the
river
parties
.
He
did
not
drink
.
The
*NL*
children
were
all
rabid
teetotallers
.
He
came
home
very
late
at
night
,
*NL*
and
sat
yet
longer
studying
.
His
mother
implored
him
to
take
more
care
,
*NL*
to
do
one
thing
or
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dance
,
if
you
want
to
dance
,
my
son
;
but
do
n't
think
you
can
work
in
*NL*
the
office
,
and
then
amuse
yourself
,
and
THEN
study
on
top
of
all
.
You
*NL*
ca
n't
;
the
human
frame
wo
n't
stand
it
.
Do
one
thing
or
the
other
--
amuse
*NL*
yourself
or
learn
Latin
;
but
do
n't
try
to
do
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
got
a
place
in
London
,
at
a
hundred
and
twenty
a
year
.
This
*NL*
seemed
a
fabulous
sum
.
His
mother
doubted
almost
whether
to
rejoice
or
*NL*
to
grieve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
want
me
in
Lime
Street
on
Monday
week
,
mother
,
''
he
cried
,
his
*NL*
eyes
blazing
as
he
read
the
letter
.
Mrs.
Morel
felt
everything
go
silent
*NL*
inside
her
.
He
read
the
letter
:
''
`
And
will
you
reply
by
Thursday
whether
*NL*
you
accept
.
Yours
faithfully
--
'
They
want
me
,
mother
,
at
a
hundred
and
*NL*
twenty
a
year
,
and
do
n't
even
ask
to
see
me
.
Did
n't
I
tell
you
I
could
*NL*
do
it
!
Think
of
me
in
London
!
And
I
can
give
you
twenty
pounds
a
year
,
*NL*
mater
.
We
s
'll
all
be
rolling
in
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
,
my
son
,
''
she
answered
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
never
occurred
to
him
that
she
might
be
more
hurt
at
his
going
*NL*
away
than
glad
of
his
success
.
Indeed
,
as
the
days
drew
near
for
his
*NL*
departure
,
her
heart
began
to
close
and
grow
dreary
with
despair
.
She
*NL*
loved
him
so
much
!
More
than
that
,
she
hoped
in
him
so
much
.
Almost
she
*NL*
lived
by
him
.
She
liked
to
do
things
for
him
:
she
liked
to
put
a
cup
for
*NL*
his
tea
and
to
iron
his
collars
,
of
which
he
was
so
proud
.
It
was
a
joy
*NL*
to
her
to
have
him
proud
of
his
collars
.
There
was
no
laundry
.
So
she
*NL*
used
to
rub
away
at
them
with
her
little
convex
iron
,
to
polish
them
,
*NL*
till
they
shone
from
the
sheer
pressure
of
her
arm
.
Now
she
would
not
do
*NL*
it
for
him
.
Now
he
was
going
away
.
She
felt
almost
as
if
he
were
going
*NL*
as
well
out
of
her
heart
.
He
did
not
seem
to
leave
her
inhabited
with
*NL*
himself
.
That
was
the
grief
and
the
pain
to
her
.
He
took
nearly
all
*NL*
himself
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
before
his
departure
--
he
was
just
twenty
--
he
burned
his
*NL*
love-letters
.
They
had
hung
on
a
file
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
*NL*
cupboard
.
From
some
of
them
he
had
read
extracts
to
his
mother
.
Some
*NL*
of
them
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
read
herself
.
But
most
were
too
*NL*
trivial
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
on
the
Saturday
morning
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
Postle
,
let
's
go
through
my
letters
,
and
you
can
have
the
*NL*
birds
and
flowers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
had
done
her
Saturday
's
work
on
the
Friday
,
because
he
was
*NL*
having
a
last
day
's
holiday
.
She
was
making
him
a
rice
cake
,
which
*NL*
he
loved
,
to
take
with
him
.
He
was
scarcely
conscious
that
she
was
so
*NL*
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
first
letter
off
the
file
.
It
was
mauve-tinted
,
and
had
*NL*
purple
and
green
thistles
.
William
sniffed
the
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nice
scent
!
Smell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
thrust
the
sheet
under
Paul
's
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Um
!
''
said
Paul
,
breathing
in
.
``
What
d'you
call
it
?
Smell
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
ducked
her
small
,
fine
nose
down
to
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
smell
their
rubbish
,
''
she
said
,
sniffing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
girl
's
father
,
''
said
William
,
``
is
as
rich
as
Croesus
.
He
owns
*NL*
property
without
end
.
She
calls
me
Lafayette
,
because
I
know
French
.
*NL*
`
You
will
see
,
I
've
forgiven
you

--
I
like

forgiving

I
told
*NL*
mother
about
you
this
morning
,
and
she
will
have
much
pleasure
if
you
*NL*
come
to
tea
on
Sunday
,
but
she
will
have
to
get
father
's
consent
also
.
I
*NL*
sincerely
hope
he
will
agree
.
I
will
let
you

however

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Let
you
know
how
it

''
interrupted
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Transpires
'
--
oh
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Transpires
!
'
''
repeated
Mrs.
Morel
mockingly
.
``
I
thought
she
was
so
*NL*
well
educated
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
William
felt
slightly
uncomfortable
,
and
abandoned
this
maiden
,
giving
*NL*
Paul
the
corner
with
the
thistles
.
He
continued
to
read
extracts
from
*NL*
his
letters
,
some
of
which
amused
his
mother
,
some
of
which
saddened
her
*NL*
and
made
her
anxious
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lad
,
''
she
said
,
``
they
're
very
wise
.
They
know
they
've
only
got
to
*NL*
flatter
your
vanity
,
and
you
press
up
to
them
like
a
dog
that
has
its
*NL*
head
scratched
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
ca
n't
go
on
scratching
for
ever
,
''
he
replied
.
``
And
when
*NL*
they
've
done
,
I
trot
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
one
day
you
'll
find
a
string
round
your
neck
that
you
ca
n't
pull
*NL*
off

''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
me
!
I
'm
equal
to
any
of

,
they
need
n't
flatter
*NL*
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
flatter
YOURSELF
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
there
was
a
heap
of
twisted
black
pages
,
all
that
remained
of
the
*NL*
file
of
scented
letters
,
except
that
Paul
had
thirty
or
forty
pretty
*NL*
tickets
from
the
corners
of
the
notepaper
--
swallows
and
forget-me-nots
*NL*
and
ivy
sprays
.
And
William
went
to
London
,
to
start
a
new
life
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
YOUNG
LIFE
OF
PAUL
*NL*
*NL*
PAUL
would
be
built
like
his
mother
,
slightly
and
rather
small
.
His
fair
*NL*
hair
went
reddish
,
and
then
dark
brown
;
his
eyes
were
grey
.
He
was
a
*NL*
pale
,
quiet
child
,
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
listen
,
and
with
a
full
,
*NL*
dropping
underlip
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
rule
he
seemed
old
for
his
years
.
He
was
so
conscious
of
what
other
*NL*
people
felt
,
particularly
his
mother
.
When
she
fretted
he
understood
,
*NL*
and
could
have
no
peace
.
His
soul
seemed
always
attentive
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
grew
older
he
became
stronger
.
William
was
too
far
removed
from
*NL*
him
to
accept
him
as
a
companion
.
So
the
smaller
boy
belonged
at
first
*NL*
almost
entirely
to
Annie
.
She
was
a
tomboy
and
a
``
flybie-skybie
''
,
as
her
*NL*
mother
called
her
.
But
she
was
intensely
fond
of
her
second
brother
.
So
*NL*
Paul
was
towed
round
at
the
heels
of
Annie
,
sharing
her
game
.
She
raced
*NL*
wildly
at
lerky
with
the
other
young
wild-cats
of
the
Bottoms
.
And
*NL*
always
Paul
flew
beside
her
,
living
her
share
of
the
game
,
having
as
*NL*
yet
no
part
of
his
own
.
He
was
quiet
and
not
noticeable
.
But
his
sister
*NL*
adored
him
.
He
always
seemed
to
care
for
things
if
she
wanted
him
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
big
doll
of
which
she
was
fearfully
proud
,
though
not
so
fond
.
*NL*
So
she
laid
the
doll
on
the
sofa
,
and
covered
it
with
an
antimacassar
,
*NL*
to
sleep
.
Then
she
forgot
it
.
Meantime
Paul
must
practise
jumping
off
*NL*
the
sofa
arm
.
So
he
jumped
crash
into
the
face
of
the
hidden
doll
.
*NL*
Annie
rushed
up
,
uttered
a
loud
wail
,
and
sat
down
to
weep
a
dirge
.
Paul
*NL*
remained
quite
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
tell
it
was
there
,
mother
;
you
could
n't
tell
it
was
*NL*
there
,
''
he
repeated
over
and
over
.
So
long
as
Annie
wept
for
the
doll
*NL*
he
sat
helpless
with
misery
.
Her
grief
wore
itself
out
.
She
forgave
*NL*
her
brother
--
he
was
so
much
upset
.
But
a
day
or
two
afterwards
she
was
*NL*
shocked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
make
a
sacrifice
of
Arabella
,
''
he
said
.
``
Let
's
burn
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
horrified
,
yet
rather
fascinated
.
She
wanted
to
see
what
the
boy
*NL*
would
do
.
He
made
an
altar
of
bricks
,
pulled
some
of
the
shavings
out
of
*NL*
Arabella
's
body
,
put
the
waxen
fragments
into
the
hollow
face
,
poured
*NL*
on
a
little
paraffin
,
and
set
the
whole
thing
alight
.
He
watched
with
*NL*
wicked
satisfaction
the
drops
of
wax
melt
off
the
broken
forehead
of
*NL*
Arabella
,
and
drop
like
sweat
into
the
flame
.
So
long
as
the
stupid
big
*NL*
doll
burned
he
rejoiced
in
silence
.
At
the
end
be
poked
among
the
embers
*NL*
with
a
stick
,
fished
out
the
arms
and
legs
,
all
blackened
,
and
smashed
*NL*
them
under
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
sacrifice
of
Missis
Arabella
,
''
he
said
.
``
An
'
I
'm
glad
*NL*
there
's
nothing
left
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
disturbed
Annie
inwardly
,
although
she
could
say
nothing
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
hate
the
doll
so
intensely
,
because
he
had
broken
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
children
,
but
particularly
Paul
,
were
peculiarly
against
their
*NL*
father
,
along
with
their
mother
.
Morel
continued
to
bully
and
to
drink
.
*NL*
He
had
periods
,
months
at
a
time
,
when
he
made
the
whole
life
of
the
*NL*
family
a
misery
.
Paul
never
forgot
coming
home
from
the
Band
of
Hope
*NL*
one
Monday
evening
and
finding
his
mother
with
her
eye
swollen
and
*NL*
discoloured
,
his
father
standing
on
the
hearthrug
,
feet
astride
,
his
*NL*
head
down
,
and
William
,
just
home
from
work
,
glaring
at
his
father
.
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
as
the
young
children
entered
,
but
none
of
the
*NL*
elders
looked
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
was
white
to
the
lips
,
and
his
fists
were
clenched
.
He
waited
*NL*
until
the
children
were
silent
,
watching
with
children
's
rage
and
hate
;
*NL*
then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
coward
,
you
dare
n't
do
it
when
I
was
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Morel
's
blood
was
up
.
He
swung
round
on
his
son
.
William
was
bigger
,
*NL*
but
Morel
was
hard-muscled
,
and
mad
with
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doss
n't
I
?
''
he
shouted
.
``
Doss
n't
I
?
Ha'e
much
more
o
'
thy
chelp
,
my
*NL*
young
jockey
,
an
'
I
'll
rattle
my
fist
about
thee
.
Ay
,
an
'
I
sholl
that
,
*NL*
dost
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
crouched
at
the
knees
and
showed
his
fist
in
an
ugly
,
almost
*NL*
beast-like
fashion
.
William
was
white
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
yer
?
''
he
said
,
quiet
and
intense
.
``
It
`
ud
be
the
last
time
,
*NL*
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
danced
a
little
nearer
,
crouching
,
drawing
back
his
fist
to
*NL*
strike
.
William
put
his
fists
ready
.
A
light
came
into
his
blue
eyes
,
*NL*
almost
like
a
laugh
.
He
watched
his
father
.
Another
word
,
and
the
men
*NL*
would
have
begun
to
fight
.
Paul
hoped
they
would
.
The
three
children
sat
*NL*
pale
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
it
,
both
of
you
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Morel
in
a
hard
voice
.
``
We
've
had
*NL*
enough
for
ONE
night
.
And
YOU
,
''
she
said
,
turning
on
to
her
husband
,
*NL*
``
look
at
your
children
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
glanced
at
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
the
children
,
you
nasty
little
bitch
!
''
he
sneered
.
``
Why
,
what
*NL*
have
I
done
to
the
children
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
But
they
're
like
*NL*
yourself
;
you
've
put
'em
up
to
your
own
tricks
and
nasty
ways
--
you
've
*NL*
learned
'em
in
it
,
you
`
ave.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
refused
to
answer
him
.
No
one
spoke
.
After
a
while
he
threw
his
*NL*
boots
under
the
table
and
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
let
me
have
a
go
at
him
?
''
said
William
,
when
his
father
*NL*
was
upstairs
.
``
I
could
easily
have
beaten
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
nice
thing
--
your
own
father
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
FATHER
!
'
''
repeated
William
.
``
Call
HIM
MY
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
is
--
and
so
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
do
n't
you
let
me
settle
him
?
I
could
do
,
easily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
idea
!
''
she
cried
.
``
It
has
n't
come
to
THAT
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
's
come
to
worse
.
Look
at
yourself
.
WHY
did
n't
you
let
*NL*
me
give
it
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
could
n't
bear
it
,
so
never
think
of
it
,
''
she
cried
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
children
went
to
bed
,
miserably
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
William
was
growing
up
,
the
family
moved
from
the
Bottoms
to
a
*NL*
house
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
,
commanding
a
view
of
the
valley
,
which
*NL*
spread
out
like
a
convex
cockle-shell
,
or
a
clamp-shell
,
before
it
.
In
*NL*
front
of
the
house
was
a
huge
old
ash-tree
.
The
west
wind
,
sweeping
from
*NL*
Derbyshire
,
caught
the
houses
with
full
force
,
and
the
tree
shrieked
*NL*
again
.
Morel
liked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
music
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
sends
me
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Paul
and
Arthur
and
Annie
hated
it
.
To
Paul
it
became
almost
a
*NL*
demoniacal
noise
.
The
winter
of
their
first
year
in
the
new
house
their
*NL*
father
was
very
bad
.
The
children
played
in
the
street
,
on
the
brim
of
*NL*
the
wide
,
dark
valley
,
until
eight
o'clock
.
Then
they
went
to
bed
.
Their
*NL*
mother
sat
sewing
below
.
Having
such
a
great
space
in
front
of
the
house
*NL*
gave
the
children
a
feeling
of
night
,
of
vastness
,
and
of
terror
.
This
*NL*
terror
came
in
from
the
shrieking
of
the
tree
and
the
anguish
of
the
*NL*
home
discord
.
Often
Paul
would
wake
up
,
after
he
had
been
asleep
a
long
*NL*
time
,
aware
of
thuds
downstairs
.
Instantly
he
was
wide
awake
.
Then
he
*NL*
heard
the
booming
shouts
of
his
father
,
come
home
nearly
drunk
,
then
the
*NL*
sharp
replies
of
his
mother
,
then
the
bang
,
bang
of
his
father
's
fist
on
*NL*
the
table
,
and
the
nasty
snarling
shout
as
the
man
's
voice
got
higher
.
*NL*
And
then
the
whole
was
drowned
in
a
piercing
medley
of
shrieks
and
*NL*
cries
from
the
great
,
wind-swept
ash-tree
.
The
children
lay
silent
in
*NL*
suspense
,
waiting
for
a
lull
in
the
wind
to
hear
what
their
father
was
*NL*
doing
.
He
might
hit
their
mother
again
.
There
was
a
feeling
of
horror
,
*NL*
a
kind
of
bristling
in
the
darkness
,
and
a
sense
of
blood
.
They
lay
with
*NL*
their
hearts
in
the
grip
of
an
intense
anguish
.
The
wind
came
through
*NL*
the
tree
fiercer
and
fiercer
.
All
the
chords
of
the
great
harp
hummed
,
*NL*
whistled
,
and
shrieked
.
And
then
came
the
horror
of
the
sudden
silence
,
*NL*
silence
everywhere
,
outside
and
downstairs
.
What
was
it
?
Was
it
a
*NL*
silence
of
blood
?
What
had
he
done
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
lay
and
breathed
the
darkness
.
And
then
,
at
last
,
they
*NL*
heard
their
father
throw
down
his
boots
and
tramp
upstairs
in
his
*NL*
stockinged
feet
.
Still
they
listened
.
Then
at
last
,
if
the
wind
allowed
,
*NL*
they
heard
the
water
of
the
tap
drumming
into
the
kettle
,
which
their
*NL*
mother
was
filling
for
morning
,
and
they
could
go
to
sleep
in
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
were
happy
in
the
morning
--
happy
,
very
happy
playing
,
dancing
at
*NL*
night
round
the
lonely
lamp-post
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
.
But
they
*NL*
had
one
tight
place
of
anxiety
in
their
hearts
,
one
darkness
in
their
*NL*
eyes
,
which
showed
all
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
hated
his
father
.
As
a
boy
he
had
a
fervent
private
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
him
stop
drinking
,
''
he
prayed
every
night
.
``
Lord
,
let
my
father
*NL*
die
,
''
he
prayed
very
often
.
``
Let
him
not
be
killed
at
pit
,
''
he
prayed
*NL*
when
,
after
tea
,
the
father
did
not
come
home
from
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
another
time
when
the
family
suffered
intensely
.
The
children
*NL*
came
from
school
and
had
their
teas
.
On
the
hob
the
big
black
saucepan
*NL*
was
simmering
,
the
stew-jar
was
in
the
oven
,
ready
for
Morel
's
dinner
.
*NL*
He
was
expected
at
five
o'clock
.
But
for
months
he
would
stop
and
drink
*NL*
every
night
on
his
way
from
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
winter
nights
,
when
it
was
cold
,
and
grew
dark
early
,
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
would
put
a
brass
candlestick
on
the
table
,
light
a
tallow
candle
to
*NL*
save
the
gas
.
The
children
finished
their
bread-and-butter
,
or
dripping
,
*NL*
and
were
ready
to
go
out
to
play
.
But
if
Morel
had
not
come
they
*NL*
faltered
.
The
sense
of
his
sitting
in
all
his
pit-dirt
,
drinking
,
after
*NL*
a
long
day
's
work
,
not
coming
home
and
eating
and
washing
,
but
sitting
,
*NL*
getting
drunk
,
on
an
empty
stomach
,
made
Mrs.
Morel
unable
to
bear
*NL*
herself
.
From
her
the
feeling
was
transmitted
to
the
other
children
.
She
*NL*
never
suffered
alone
any
more
:
the
children
suffered
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
out
to
play
with
the
rest
.
Down
in
the
great
trough
of
*NL*
twilight
,
tiny
clusters
of
lights
burned
where
the
pits
were
.
A
few
last
*NL*
colliers
straggled
up
the
dim
field
path
.
The
lamplighter
came
along
.
No
*NL*
more
colliers
came
.
Darkness
shut
down
over
the
valley
;
work
was
done
.
*NL*
It
was
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Paul
ran
anxiously
into
the
kitchen
.
The
one
candle
still
burned
on
*NL*
the
table
,
the
big
fire
glowed
red
.
Mrs.
Morel
sat
alone
.
On
the
hob
*NL*
the
saucepan
steamed
;
the
dinner-plate
lay
waiting
on
the
table
.
All
*NL*
the
room
was
full
of
the
sense
of
waiting
,
waiting
for
the
man
who
was
*NL*
sitting
in
his
pit-dirt
,
dinnerless
,
some
mile
away
from
home
,
across
*NL*
the
darkness
,
drinking
himself
drunk
.
Paul
stood
in
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
my
dad
come
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
see
he
has
n't
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
cross
with
the
futility
of
the
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
boy
dawdled
about
near
his
mother
.
They
shared
the
same
*NL*
anxiety
.
Presently
Mrs.
Morel
went
out
and
strained
the
potatoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
ruined
and
black
,
''
she
said
;
``
but
what
do
I
care
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
many
words
were
spoken
.
Paul
almost
hated
his
mother
for
suffering
*NL*
because
his
father
did
not
come
home
from
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
bother
yourself
for
?
''
he
said
.
``
If
he
wants
to
stop
and
get
*NL*
drunk
,
why
do
n't
you
let
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
!
''
flashed
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
You
may
well
say
`
let
him
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
that
the
man
who
stops
on
the
way
home
from
work
is
on
a
quick
*NL*
way
to
ruining
himself
and
his
home
.
The
children
were
yet
young
,
and
*NL*
depended
on
the
breadwinner
.
William
gave
her
the
sense
of
relief
,
*NL*
providing
her
at
last
with
someone
to
turn
to
if
Morel
failed
.
But
the
*NL*
tense
atmosphere
of
the
room
on
these
waiting
evenings
was
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minutes
ticked
away
.
At
six
o'clock
still
the
cloth
lay
on
the
*NL*
table
,
still
the
dinner
stood
waiting
,
still
the
same
sense
of
anxiety
*NL*
and
expectation
in
the
room
.
The
boy
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
.
He
*NL*
could
not
go
out
and
play
.
So
he
ran
in
to
Mrs.
Inger
,
next
door
but
*NL*
one
,
for
her
to
talk
to
him
.
She
had
no
children
.
Her
husband
was
good
*NL*
to
her
but
was
in
a
shop
,
and
came
home
late
.
So
,
when
she
saw
the
lad
*NL*
at
the
door
,
she
called
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
Paul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
sat
talking
for
some
time
,
when
suddenly
the
boy
rose
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
be
going
and
seeing
if
my
mother
wants
an
errand
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pretended
to
be
perfectly
cheerful
,
and
did
not
tell
his
friend
what
*NL*
ailed
him
.
Then
he
ran
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
at
these
times
came
in
churlish
and
hateful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
nice
time
to
come
home
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wha
's
it
matter
to
yo
'
what
time
I
come
whoam
?
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
everybody
in
the
house
was
still
,
because
he
was
dangerous
.
He
ate
*NL*
his
food
in
the
most
brutal
manner
possible
,
and
,
when
he
had
done
,
*NL*
pushed
all
the
pots
in
a
heap
away
from
him
,
to
lay
his
arms
on
the
*NL*
table
.
Then
he
went
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
hated
his
father
so
.
The
collier
's
small
,
mean
head
,
with
its
black
*NL*
hair
slightly
soiled
with
grey
,
lay
on
the
bare
arms
,
and
the
face
,
*NL*
dirty
and
inflamed
,
with
a
fleshy
nose
and
thin
,
paltry
brows
,
was
*NL*
turned
sideways
,
asleep
with
beer
and
weariness
and
nasty
temper
.
If
*NL*
anyone
entered
suddenly
,
or
a
noise
were
made
,
the
man
looked
up
and
*NL*
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
lay
my
fist
about
thy
y'
ead
,
I
'm
tellin
'
thee
,
if
tha
doesna
stop
*NL*
that
clatter
!
Dost
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
two
last
words
,
shouted
in
a
bullying
fashion
,
usually
at
Annie
,
*NL*
made
the
family
writhe
with
hate
of
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
shut
out
from
all
family
affairs
.
No
one
told
him
anything
.
*NL*
The
children
,
alone
with
their
mother
,
told
her
all
about
the
day
's
*NL*
happenings
,
everything
.
Nothing
had
really
taken
place
in
them
until
it
*NL*
was
told
to
their
mother
.
But
as
soon
as
the
father
came
in
,
everything
*NL*
stopped
.
He
was
like
the
scotch
in
the
smooth
,
happy
machinery
of
the
*NL*
home
.
And
he
was
always
aware
of
this
fall
of
silence
on
his
entry
,
*NL*
the
shutting
off
of
life
,
the
unwelcome
.
But
now
it
was
gone
too
far
to
*NL*
alter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
dearly
have
liked
the
children
to
talk
to
him
,
but
they
could
*NL*
not
.
Sometimes
Mrs.
Morel
would
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
tell
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
won
a
prize
in
a
competition
in
a
child
's
paper
.
Everybody
was
*NL*
highly
jubilant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
'd
better
tell
your
father
when
he
comes
in
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
``
You
know
how
be
carries
on
and
says
he
's
never
told
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Paul
.
But
he
would
almost
rather
have
forfeited
the
*NL*
prize
than
have
to
tell
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
won
a
prize
in
a
competition
,
dad
,
''
he
said
.
Morel
turned
round
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
,
my
boy
?
What
sort
of
a
competition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
--
about
famous
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
is
the
prize
,
then
,
as
you
've
got
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
birds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
--
hm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
was
all
.
Conversation
was
impossible
between
the
father
and
any
*NL*
other
member
of
the
family
.
He
was
an
outsider
.
He
had
denied
the
God
in
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
times
when
he
entered
again
into
the
life
of
his
own
people
*NL*
was
when
he
worked
,
and
was
happy
at
work
.
Sometimes
,
in
the
evening
,
he
*NL*
cobbled
the
boots
or
mended
the
kettle
or
his
pit-bottle
.
Then
he
always
*NL*
wanted
several
attendants
,
and
the
children
enjoyed
it
.
They
united
with
*NL*
him
in
the
work
,
in
the
actual
doing
of
something
,
when
he
was
his
real
*NL*
self
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
good
workman
,
dexterous
,
and
one
who
,
when
he
was
in
a
good
*NL*
humour
,
always
sang
.
He
had
whole
periods
,
months
,
almost
years
,
of
*NL*
friction
and
nasty
temper
.
Then
sometimes
he
was
jolly
again
.
It
was
*NL*
nice
to
see
him
run
with
a
piece
of
red-hot
iron
into
the
scullery
,
*NL*
crying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
my
road
--
out
of
my
road
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
hammered
the
soft
,
red-glowing
stuff
on
his
iron
goose
,
and
made
*NL*
the
shape
he
wanted
.
Or
he
sat
absorbed
for
a
moment
,
soldering
.
Then
*NL*
the
children
watched
with
joy
as
the
metal
sank
suddenly
molten
,
and
was
*NL*
shoved
about
against
the
nose
of
the
soldering-iron
,
while
the
room
was
*NL*
full
of
a
scent
of
burnt
resin
and
hot
tin
,
and
Morel
was
silent
and
*NL*
intent
for
a
minute
.
He
always
sang
when
he
mended
boots
because
of
the
*NL*
jolly
sound
of
hammering
.
And
he
was
rather
happy
when
he
sat
putting
*NL*
great
patches
on
his
moleskin
pit
trousers
,
which
he
would
often
do
,
*NL*
considering
them
too
dirty
,
and
the
stuff
too
hard
,
for
his
wife
to
*NL*
mend
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
best
time
for
the
young
children
was
when
he
made
fuses
.
Morel
*NL*
fetched
a
sheaf
of
long
sound
wheat-straws
from
the
attic
.
These
he
*NL*
cleaned
with
his
hand
,
till
each
one
gleamed
like
a
stalk
of
gold
,
after
*NL*
which
he
cut
the
straws
into
lengths
of
about
six
inches
,
leaving
,
if
he
*NL*
could
,
a
notch
at
the
bottom
of
each
piece
.
He
always
had
a
beautifully
*NL*
sharp
knife
that
could
cut
a
straw
clean
without
hurting
it
.
Then
he
set
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
the
table
a
heap
of
gunpowder
,
a
little
pile
of
black
*NL*
grains
upon
the
white-scrubbed
board
.
He
made
and
trimmed
the
straws
*NL*
while
Paul
and
Annie
rifled
and
plugged
them
.
Paul
loved
to
see
the
*NL*
black
grains
trickle
down
a
crack
in
his
palm
into
the
mouth
of
the
*NL*
straw
,
peppering
jollily
downwards
till
the
straw
was
full
.
Then
he
*NL*
bunged
up
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
soap
--
which
he
got
on
his
thumb-nail
*NL*
from
a
pat
in
a
saucer
--
and
the
straw
was
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
dad
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
my
beauty
,
''
replied
Morel
,
who
was
peculiarly
lavish
of
*NL*
endearments
to
his
second
son
.
Paul
popped
the
fuse
into
the
powder-tin
,
*NL*
ready
for
the
morning
,
when
Morel
would
take
it
to
the
pit
,
and
use
it
*NL*
to
fire
a
shot
that
would
blast
the
coal
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
Arthur
,
still
fond
of
his
father
,
would
lean
on
the
arm
of
*NL*
Morel
's
chair
and
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
us
about
down
pit
,
daddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
Morel
loved
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
's
one
little
`
oss
--
we
call
`
im
Taffy
,
''
he
would
begin
.
``
An

*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
had
a
warm
way
of
telling
a
story
.
He
made
one
feel
Taffy
's
*NL*
cunning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
brown
`
un

''
he
would
answer
,
``

not
very
high

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

Arthur
always
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wants
a
bit

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
story
of
Taffy
would
go
on
interminably
,
and
everybody
loved
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
sometimes
it
was
a
new
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
what

When
I
went
to

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
These
happy
evenings
could
not
take
place
unless
Morel
had
some
job
*NL*
to
do
.
And
then
he
always
went
to
bed
very
early
,
often
before
the
*NL*
children
.
There
was
nothing
remaining
for
him
to
stay
up
for
,
when
he
*NL*
had
finished
tinkering
,
and
had
skimmed
the
headlines
of
the
newspaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
children
felt
secure
when
their
father
was
in
bed
.
They
lay
and
*NL*
talked
softly
a
while
.
Then
they
started
as
the
lights
went
suddenly
*NL*
sprawling
over
the
ceiling
from
the
lamps
that
swung
in
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
colliers
tramping
by
outside
,
going
to
take
the
nine
o'clock
shift
.
They
*NL*
listened
to
the
voices
of
the
men
,
imagined
them
dipping
down
into
the
*NL*
dark
valley
.
Sometimes
they
went
to
the
window
and
watched
the
three
*NL*
or
four
lamps
growing
tinier
and
tinier
,
swaying
down
the
fields
in
the
*NL*
darkness
.
Then
it
was
a
joy
to
rush
back
to
bed
and
cuddle
closely
in
*NL*
the
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
rather
a
delicate
boy
,
subject
to
bronchitis
.
The
others
were
*NL*
all
quite
strong
;
so
this
was
another
reason
for
his
mother
's
difference
*NL*
in
feeling
for
him
.
One
day
he
came
home
at
dinner-time
feeling
ill
.
But
*NL*
it
was
not
a
family
to
make
any
fuss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
YOU
?
''
his
mother
asked
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
ate
no
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
eat
no
dinner
,
you
're
not
going
to
school
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
after
dinner
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
,
on
the
warm
chintz
cushions
the
*NL*
children
loved
.
Then
he
fell
into
a
kind
of
doze
.
That
afternoon
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
was
ironing
.
She
listened
to
the
small
,
restless
noise
the
boy
*NL*
made
in
his
throat
as
she
worked
.
Again
rose
in
her
heart
the
old
,
*NL*
almost
weary
feeling
towards
him
.
She
had
never
expected
him
to
live
.
*NL*
And
yet
he
had
a
great
vitality
in
his
young
body
.
Perhaps
it
would
have
*NL*
been
a
little
relief
to
her
if
he
had
died
.
She
always
felt
a
mixture
of
*NL*
anguish
in
her
love
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
,
in
his
semi-conscious
sleep
,
was
vaguely
aware
of
the
clatter
of
the
*NL*
iron
on
the
iron-stand
,
of
the
faint
thud
,
thud
on
the
ironing-board
.
*NL*
Once
roused
,
he
opened
his
eyes
to
see
his
mother
standing
on
the
*NL*
hearthrug
with
the
hot
iron
near
her
cheek
,
listening
,
as
it
were
,
to
*NL*
the
heat
.
Her
still
face
,
with
the
mouth
closed
tight
from
suffering
and
*NL*
disillusion
and
self-denial
,
and
her
nose
the
smallest
bit
on
one
side
,
*NL*
and
her
blue
eyes
so
young
,
quick
,
and
warm
,
made
his
heart
contract
*NL*
with
love
.
When
she
was
quiet
,
so
,
she
looked
brave
and
rich
with
life
,
*NL*
but
as
if
she
had
been
done
out
of
her
rights
.
It
hurt
the
boy
keenly
,
*NL*
this
feeling
about
her
that
she
had
never
had
her
life
's
fulfilment
:
*NL*
and
his
own
incapability
to
make
up
to
her
hurt
him
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
impotence
,
yet
made
him
patiently
dogged
inside
.
It
was
his
childish
*NL*
aim
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spat
on
the
iron
,
and
a
little
ball
of
spit
bounded
,
raced
off
the
*NL*
dark
,
glossy
surface
.
Then
,
kneeling
,
she
rubbed
the
iron
on
the
sack
*NL*
lining
of
the
hearthrug
vigorously
.
She
was
warm
in
the
ruddy
firelight
.
*NL*
Paul
loved
the
way
she
crouched
and
put
her
head
on
one
side
.
Her
*NL*
movements
were
light
and
quick
.
It
was
always
a
pleasure
to
watch
her
.
*NL*
Nothing
she
ever
did
,
no
movement
she
ever
made
,
could
have
been
found
*NL*
fault
with
by
her
children
.
The
room
was
warm
and
full
of
the
scent
of
*NL*
hot
linen
.
Later
on
the
clergyman
came
and
talked
softly
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
laid
up
with
an
attack
of
bronchitis
.
He
did
not
mind
much
.
*NL*
What
happened
happened
,
and
it
was
no
good
kicking
against
the
pricks
.
*NL*
He
loved
the
evenings
,
after
eight
o'clock
,
when
the
light
was
put
out
,
*NL*
and
he
could
watch
the
fire-flames
spring
over
the
darkness
of
the
walls
*NL*
and
ceiling
;
could
watch
huge
shadows
waving
and
tossing
,
till
the
room
*NL*
seemed
full
of
men
who
battled
silently
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
retiring
to
bed
,
the
father
would
come
into
the
sickroom
.
He
was
*NL*
always
very
gentle
if
anyone
were
ill
.
But
he
disturbed
the
atmosphere
*NL*
for
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
ter
asleep
,
my
darlin
'
?
''
Morel
asked
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
is
my
mother
comin
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
just
finishin
'
foldin
'
the
clothes
.
Do
you
want
anything
?
''
Morel
*NL*
rarely
``
thee
'd
''
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
nothing
.
But
how
long
will
she
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
long
,
my
duckie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
waited
undecidedly
on
the
hearthrug
for
a
moment
or
two
.
He
*NL*
felt
his
son
did
not
want
him
.
Then
he
went
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
*NL*
said
to
his
wife
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
childt
's
axin
'
for
thee
;
how
long
art
goin
'
to
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Until
I
've
finished
,
good
gracious
!
Tell
him
to
go
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
says
you
're
to
go
to
sleep
,
''
the
father
repeated
gently
to
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
want
HER
to
come
,
''
insisted
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
he
ca
n't
go
off
till
you
come
,
''
Morel
called
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
dear
!
I
sha
n't
be
long
.
And
do
stop
shouting
downstairs
.
There
's
*NL*
the
other
children
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Morel
came
again
and
crouched
before
the
bedroom
fire
.
He
loved
a
*NL*
fire
dearly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
says
she
wo
n't
be
long
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
loitered
about
indefinitely
.
The
boy
began
to
get
feverish
with
*NL*
irritation
.
His
father
's
presence
seemed
to
aggravate
all
his
sick
*NL*
impatience
.
At
last
Morel
,
after
having
stood
looking
at
his
son
awhile
,
*NL*
said
softly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
my
darling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
Paul
replied
,
turning
round
in
relief
to
be
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
loved
to
sleep
with
his
mother
.
Sleep
is
still
most
perfect
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
hygienists
,
when
it
is
shared
with
a
beloved
.
The
warmth
,
the
*NL*
security
and
peace
of
soul
,
the
utter
comfort
from
the
touch
of
the
*NL*
other
,
knits
the
sleep
,
so
that
it
takes
the
body
and
soul
completely
in
*NL*
its
healing
.
Paul
lay
against
her
and
slept
,
and
got
better
;
whilst
she
,
*NL*
always
a
bad
sleeper
,
fell
later
on
into
a
profound
sleep
that
seemed
to
*NL*
give
her
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
convalescence
he
would
sit
up
in
bed
,
see
the
fluffy
horses
feeding
*NL*
at
the
troughs
in
the
field
,
scattering
their
hay
on
the
trodden
yellow
*NL*
snow
;
watch
the
miners
troop
home
--
small
,
black
figures
trailing
slowly
*NL*
in
gangs
across
the
white
field
.
Then
the
night
came
up
in
dark
blue
*NL*
vapour
from
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
convalescence
everything
was
wonderful
.
The
snowflakes
,
suddenly
*NL*
arriving
on
the
window-pane
,
clung
there
a
moment
like
swallows
,
*NL*
then
were
gone
,
and
a
drop
of
water
was
crawling
down
the
glass
.
The
*NL*
snowflakes
whirled
round
the
corner
of
the
house
,
like
pigeons
dashing
*NL*
by
.
Away
across
the
valley
the
little
black
train
crawled
doubtfully
*NL*
over
the
great
whiteness
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
so
poor
,
the
children
were
delighted
if
they
could
do
*NL*
anything
to
help
economically
.
Annie
and
Paul
and
Arthur
went
out
early
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
in
summer
,
looking
for
mushrooms
,
hunting
through
the
*NL*
wet
grass
,
from
which
the
larks
were
rising
,
for
the
white-skinned
,
*NL*
wonderful
naked
bodies
crouched
secretly
in
the
green
.
And
if
they
got
*NL*
half
a
pound
they
felt
exceedingly
happy
:
there
was
the
joy
of
finding
*NL*
something
,
the
joy
of
accepting
something
straight
from
the
hand
of
*NL*
Nature
,
and
the
joy
of
contributing
to
the
family
exchequer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
most
important
harvest
,
after
gleaning
for
frumenty
,
was
the
*NL*
blackberries
.
Mrs.
Morel
must
buy
fruit
for
puddings
on
the
Saturdays
;
*NL*
also
she
liked
blackberries
.
So
Paul
and
Arthur
scoured
the
coppices
and
*NL*
woods
and
old
quarries
,
so
long
as
a
blackberry
was
to
be
found
,
every
*NL*
week-end
going
on
their
search
.
In
that
region
of
mining
villages
*NL*
blackberries
became
a
comparative
rarity
.
But
Paul
hunted
far
and
wide
.
*NL*
He
loved
being
out
in
the
country
,
among
the
bushes
.
But
he
also
could
*NL*
not
bear
to
go
home
to
his
mother
empty
.
That
,
he
felt
,
would
disappoint
*NL*
her
,
and
he
would
have
died
rather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
!
''
she
would
exclaim
as
the
lads
came
in
,
late
,
and
tired
*NL*
to
death
,
and
hungry
,
``
wherever
have
you
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
replied
Paul
,
``
there
was
n't
any
,
so
we
went
over
Misk
Hills
.
And
*NL*
look
here
,
our
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
peeped
into
the
basket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
those
are
fine
ones
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
's
over
two
pounds
--
is
n't
there
over
two
pounds
''
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
the
basket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Paul
fished
out
a
little
spray
.
He
always
brought
her
one
spray
,
*NL*
the
best
he
could
find
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
!
''
she
said
,
in
a
curious
tone
,
of
a
woman
accepting
a
*NL*
love-token
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
walked
all
day
,
went
miles
and
miles
,
rather
than
own
himself
*NL*
beaten
and
come
home
to
her
empty-handed
.
She
never
realised
this
,
*NL*
whilst
he
was
young
.
She
was
a
woman
who
waited
for
her
children
to
grow
*NL*
up
.
And
William
occupied
her
chiefly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
William
went
to
Nottingham
,
and
was
not
so
much
at
home
,
the
*NL*
mother
made
a
companion
of
Paul
.
The
latter
was
unconsciously
jealous
of
*NL*
his
brother
,
and
William
was
jealous
of
him
.
At
the
same
time
,
they
were
*NL*
good
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
's
intimacy
with
her
second
son
was
more
subtle
and
fine
,
*NL*
perhaps
not
so
passionate
as
with
her
eldest
.
It
was
the
rule
that
Paul
*NL*
should
fetch
the
money
on
Friday
afternoons
.
The
colliers
of
the
five
*NL*
pits
were
paid
on
Fridays
,
but
not
individually
.
All
the
earnings
of
*NL*
each
stall
were
put
down
to
the
chief
butty
,
as
contractor
,
and
he
*NL*
divided
the
wages
again
,
either
in
the
public-house
or
in
his
own
home
.
*NL*
So
that
the
children
could
fetch
the
money
,
school
closed
early
on
*NL*
Friday
afternoons
.
Each
of
the
Morel
children
--
William
,
then
Annie
,
*NL*
then
Paul
--
had
fetched
the
money
on
Friday
afternoons
,
until
they
went
*NL*
themselves
to
work
.
Paul
used
to
set
off
at
half-past
three
,
with
a
*NL*
little
calico
bag
in
his
pocket
.
Down
all
the
paths
,
women
,
girls
,
*NL*
children
,
and
men
were
seen
trooping
to
the
offices
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
offices
were
quite
handsome
:
a
new
,
red-brick
building
,
almost
*NL*
like
a
mansion
,
standing
in
its
own
grounds
at
the
end
of
Greenhill
*NL*
Lane
.
The
waiting-room
was
the
hall
,
a
long
,
bare
room
paved
with
blue
*NL*
brick
,
and
having
a
seat
all
round
,
against
the
wall
.
Here
sat
the
*NL*
colliers
in
their
pit-dirt
.
They
had
come
up
early
.
The
women
and
*NL*
children
usually
loitered
about
on
the
red
gravel
paths
.
Paul
always
*NL*
examined
the
grass
border
,
and
the
big
grass
bank
,
because
in
it
grew
*NL*
tiny
pansies
and
tiny
forget-me-nots
.
There
was
a
sound
of
many
voices
.
*NL*
The
women
had
on
their
Sunday
hats
.
The
girls
chattered
loudly
.
Little
*NL*
dogs
ran
here
and
there
.
The
green
shrubs
were
silent
all
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
from
inside
came
the
cry
``
Spinney
Park
--
Spinney
Park
.
''
All
the
folk
*NL*
for
Spinney
Park
trooped
inside
.
When
it
was
time
for
Bretty
to
be
paid
,
*NL*
Paul
went
in
among
the
crowd
.
The
pay-room
was
quite
small
.
A
counter
*NL*
went
across
,
dividing
it
into
half
.
Behind
the
counter
stood
two
*NL*
men
--
Mr.
Braithwaite
and
his
clerk
,
Mr.
Winterbottom
.
Mr.
Braithwaite
*NL*
was
large
,
somewhat
of
the
stern
patriarch
in
appearance
,
having
a
*NL*
rather
thin
white
beard
.
He
was
usually
muffled
in
an
enormous
silk
*NL*
neckerchief
,
and
right
up
to
the
hot
summer
a
huge
fire
burned
in
the
*NL*
open
grate
.
No
window
was
open
.
Sometimes
in
winter
the
air
scorched
the
*NL*
throats
of
the
people
,
coming
in
from
the
freshness
.
Mr.
Winterbottom
*NL*
was
rather
small
and
fat
,
and
very
bald
.
He
made
remarks
that
were
not
*NL*
witty
,
whilst
his
chief
launched
forth
patriarchal
admonitions
against
*NL*
the
colliers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
crowded
with
miners
in
their
pit-dirt
,
men
who
had
been
*NL*
home
and
changed
,
and
women
,
and
one
or
two
children
,
and
usually
a
dog
.
*NL*
Paul
was
quite
small
,
so
it
was
often
his
fate
to
be
jammed
behind
the
*NL*
legs
of
the
men
,
near
the
fire
which
scorched
him
.
He
knew
the
order
of
*NL*
the
names
--
they
went
according
to
stall
number
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holliday
,
''
came
the
ringing
voice
of
Mr.
Braithwaite
.
Then
Mrs.
*NL*
Holliday
stepped
silently
forward
,
was
paid
,
drew
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bower
--
John
Bower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
boy
stepped
to
the
counter
.
Mr.
Braithwaite
,
large
and
irascible
,
*NL*
glowered
at
him
over
his
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
John
Bower
!
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
me
,
''
said
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
used
to
`
ave
a
different
nose
than
that
,
''
said
glossy
Mr.
*NL*
Winterbottom
,
peering
over
the
counter
.
The
people
tittered
,
thinking
of
*NL*
John
Bower
senior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
it
your
father
's
not
come
!
''
said
Mr.
Braithwaite
,
in
a
large
and
*NL*
magisterial
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
badly
,
''
piped
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
tell
him
to
keep
off
the
drink
,
''
pronounced
the
great
*NL*
cashier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
niver
mind
if
he
puts
his
foot
through
yer
,
''
said
a
mocking
voice
*NL*
from
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
men
laughed
.
The
large
and
important
cashier
looked
down
at
his
*NL*
next
sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fred
Pilkington
!
''
he
called
,
quite
indifferent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Braithwaite
was
an
important
shareholder
in
the
firm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
knew
his
turn
was
next
but
one
,
and
his
heart
began
to
beat
.
He
was
*NL*
pushed
against
the
chimney-piece
.
His
calves
were
burning
.
But
he
did
*NL*
not
hope
to
get
through
the
wall
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walter
Morel
!
''
came
the
ringing
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
''
piped
Paul
,
small
and
inadequate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morel
--
Walter
Morel
!
''
the
cashier
repeated
,
his
finger
and
thumb
on
the
*NL*
invoice
,
ready
to
pass
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
suffering
convulsions
of
self-consciousness
,
and
could
not
*NL*
or
would
not
shout
.
The
backs
of
the
men
obliterated
him
.
Then
Mr.
*NL*
Winterbottom
came
to
the
rescue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
here
.
Where
is
he
?
Morel
's
lad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fat
,
red
,
bald
little
man
peered
round
with
keen
eyes
.
He
pointed
at
*NL*
the
fireplace
.
The
colliers
looked
round
,
moved
aside
,
and
disclosed
the
*NL*
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
he
is
!
''
said
Mr.
Winterbottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
to
the
counter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seventeen
pounds
eleven
and
fivepence
.
Why
do
n't
you
shout
up
when
*NL*
you
're
called
?
''
said
Mr.
Braithwaite
.
He
banged
on
to
the
invoice
a
*NL*
five-pound
bag
of
silver
,
then
in
a
delicate
and
pretty
movement
,
picked
*NL*
up
a
little
ten-pound
column
of
gold
,
and
plumped
it
beside
the
silver
.
*NL*
The
gold
slid
in
a
bright
stream
over
the
paper
.
The
cashier
finished
*NL*
counting
off
the
money
;
the
boy
dragged
the
whole
down
the
counter
to
*NL*
Mr.
Winterbottom
,
to
whom
the
stoppages
for
rent
and
tools
must
be
paid
.
*NL*
Here
he
suffered
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixteen
an
'
six
,
''
said
Mr.
Winterbottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
was
too
much
upset
to
count
.
He
pushed
forward
some
loose
silver
*NL*
and
half
a
sovereign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
you
think
you
've
given
me
?
''
asked
Mr.
Winterbottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
looked
at
him
,
but
said
nothing
.
He
had
not
the
faintest
notion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
got
a
tongue
in
your
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
bit
his
lip
,
and
pushed
forward
some
more
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
they
teach
you
to
count
at
the
Board-school
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nowt
but
algibbra
an
'
French
,
''
said
a
collier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
cheek
an
'
impidence
,
''
said
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
keeping
someone
waiting
.
With
trembling
fingers
he
got
his
*NL*
money
into
the
bag
and
slid
out
.
He
suffered
the
tortures
of
the
damned
*NL*
on
these
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
relief
,
when
he
got
outside
,
and
was
walking
along
the
Mansfield
*NL*
Road
,
was
infinite
.
On
the
park
wall
the
mosses
were
green
.
There
were
*NL*
some
gold
and
some
white
fowls
pecking
under
the
apple
trees
of
an
*NL*
orchard
.
The
colliers
were
walking
home
in
a
stream
.
The
boy
went
near
*NL*
the
wall
,
self-consciously
.
He
knew
many
of
the
men
,
but
could
not
*NL*
recognise
them
in
their
dirt
.
And
this
was
a
new
torture
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
got
down
to
the
New
Inn
,
at
Bretty
,
his
father
was
not
yet
come
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Wharmby
,
the
landlady
,
knew
him
.
His
grandmother
,
Morel
's
mother
,
*NL*
had
been
Mrs.
Wharmby
's
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
's
not
come
yet
,
''
said
the
landlady
,
in
the
peculiar
*NL*
half-scornful
,
half-patronising
voice
of
a
woman
who
talks
chiefly
to
*NL*
grown
men
.
``
Sit
you
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bench
in
the
bar
.
Some
colliers
were
*NL*
``
reckoning
''
--
sharing
out
their
money
--
in
a
corner
;
others
came
in
.
They
*NL*
all
glanced
at
the
boy
without
speaking
.
At
last
Morel
came
;
brisk
,
and
*NL*
with
something
of
an
air
,
even
in
his
blackness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
he
said
rather
tenderly
to
his
son
.
``
Have
you
bested
me
?
Shall
*NL*
you
have
a
drink
of
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
and
all
the
children
were
bred
up
fierce
anti-alcoholists
,
and
he
*NL*
would
have
suffered
more
in
drinking
a
lemonade
before
all
the
men
than
*NL*
in
having
a
tooth
drawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
looked
at
him
_
de
haut
en
bas
_
,
rather
pitying
,
and
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
resenting
his
clear
,
fierce
morality
.
Paul
went
home
,
*NL*
glowering
.
He
entered
the
house
silently
.
Friday
was
baking
day
,
and
*NL*
there
was
usually
a
hot
bun
.
His
mother
put
it
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
turned
on
her
in
a
fury
,
his
eyes
flashing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
NOT
going
to
the
office
any
more
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
?
''
his
mother
asked
in
surprise
.
His
sudden
rages
*NL*
rather
amused
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
NOT
going
any
more
,
''
he
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
tell
your
father
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
chewed
his
bun
as
if
he
hated
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
--
I
'm
not
going
to
fetch
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
one
of
Carlin
's
children
can
go
;
they
'd
be
glad
enough
of
the
*NL*
sixpence
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sixpence
was
Paul
's
only
income
.
It
mostly
went
in
buying
birthday
*NL*
presents
;
but
it
WAS
an
income
,
and
he
treasured
it
.
But
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
can
have
it
,
then
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
''
said
his
mother
.
``
But
you
need
n't
bully
ME
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
hateful
,
and
common
,
and
hateful
,
they
are
,
and
I
'm
not
going
*NL*
any
more
.
Mr.
Braithwaite
drops
his
`
h
's
'
,
an
'
Mr.
Winterbottom
says
*NL*
`
You
was
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
that
why
you
wo
n't
go
any
more
?
''
smiled
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
was
silent
for
some
time
.
His
face
was
pale
,
his
eyes
dark
and
*NL*
furious
.
His
mother
moved
about
at
her
work
,
taking
no
notice
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
always
stan
'
in
front
of
me
,
so
's
I
ca
n't
get
out
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
lad
,
you
've
only
to
ASK
them
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
then
Alfred
Winterbottom
says
,
`
What
do
they
teach
you
at
the
*NL*
Board-school
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
never
taught
HIM
much
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
that
is
a
fact
--
neither
*NL*
manners
nor
wit
--
and
his
cunning
he
was
born
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
in
her
own
way
,
she
soothed
him
.
His
ridiculous
hypersensitiveness
*NL*
made
her
heart
ache
.
And
sometimes
the
fury
in
his
eyes
roused
her
,
made
*NL*
her
sleeping
soul
lift
up
its
head
a
moment
,
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
cheque
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seventeen
pounds
eleven
and
fivepence
,
and
sixteen
and
six
stoppages
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
boy
.
``
It
's
a
good
week
;
and
only
five
shillings
stoppages
*NL*
for
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
was
able
to
calculate
how
much
her
husband
had
earned
,
and
could
*NL*
call
him
to
account
if
he
gave
her
short
money
.
Morel
always
kept
to
*NL*
himself
the
secret
of
the
week
's
amount
.
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
was
the
baking
night
and
market
night
.
It
was
the
rule
that
Paul
*NL*
should
stay
at
home
and
bake
.
He
loved
to
stop
in
and
draw
or
read
;
he
*NL*
was
very
fond
of
drawing
.
Annie
always
``
gallivanted
''
on
Friday
nights
;
*NL*
Arthur
was
enjoying
himself
as
usual
.
So
the
boy
remained
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
loved
her
marketing
.
In
the
tiny
market-place
on
the
top
*NL*
of
the
hill
,
where
four
roads
,
from
Nottingham
and
Derby
,
Ilkeston
*NL*
and
Mansfield
,
meet
,
many
stalls
were
erected
.
Brakes
ran
in
from
*NL*
surrounding
villages
.
The
market-place
was
full
of
women
,
the
streets
*NL*
packed
with
men
.
It
was
amazing
to
see
so
many
men
everywhere
in
the
*NL*
streets
.
Mrs.
Morel
usually
quarrelled
with
her
lace
woman
,
sympathised
*NL*
with
her
fruit
man
--
who
was
a
gabey
,
but
his
wife
was
a
bad
`
un
--
laughed
*NL*
with
the
fish
man
--
who
was
a
scamp
but
so
droll
--
put
the
linoleum
man
*NL*
in
his
place
,
was
cold
with
the
odd-wares
man
,
and
only
went
to
the
*NL*
crockery
man
when
she
was
driven
--
or
drawn
by
the
cornflowers
on
a
*NL*
little
dish
;
then
she
was
coldly
polite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wondered
how
much
that
little
dish
was
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sevenpence
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
the
dish
down
and
walked
away
;
but
she
could
not
leave
the
*NL*
market-place
without
it
.
Again
she
went
by
where
the
pots
lay
coldly
on
*NL*
the
floor
,
and
she
glanced
at
the
dish
furtively
,
pretending
not
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
little
woman
,
in
a
bonnet
and
a
black
costume
.
Her
bonnet
was
*NL*
in
its
third
year
;
it
was
a
great
grievance
to
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
''
the
girl
implored
,
``
do
n't
wear
that
nubbly
little
bonnet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
else
shall
I
wear
,
''
replied
the
mother
tartly
.
``
And
I
'm
sure
*NL*
it
's
right
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
started
with
a
tip
;
then
had
had
flowers
;
now
was
reduced
to
*NL*
black
lace
and
a
bit
of
jet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
rather
come
down
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
Could
n't
you
give
it
a
*NL*
pick-me-up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
jowl
your
head
for
impudence
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
and
she
tied
the
*NL*
strings
of
the
black
bonnet
valiantly
under
her
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
at
the
dish
again
.
Both
she
and
her
enemy
,
the
pot
man
,
*NL*
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
,
as
if
there
were
something
between
them
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
it
for
fivepence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
.
Her
heart
hardened
;
but
then
she
stooped
and
took
up
her
*NL*
dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
have
it
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yer
'll
do
me
the
favour
,
like
?
''
he
said
.
``
Yer
'd
better
spit
in
it
,
like
*NL*
yer
do
when
y'
ave
something
give
yer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
paid
him
the
fivepence
in
a
cold
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
you
give
it
me
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
would
n't
let
me
have
it
for
*NL*
fivepence
if
you
did
n't
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
flamin
'
,
scrattlin
'
place
you
may
count
yerself
lucky
if
you
*NL*
can
give
your
things
away
,
''
he
growled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
there
are
bad
times
,
and
good
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
forgiven
the
pot
man
.
They
were
friends
.
She
dare
now
finger
*NL*
his
pots
.
So
she
was
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
waiting
for
her
.
He
loved
her
home-coming
.
She
was
always
her
*NL*
best
so
--
triumphant
,
tired
,
laden
with
parcels
,
feeling
rich
in
spirit
.
*NL*
He
heard
her
quick
,
light
step
in
the
entry
and
looked
up
from
his
*NL*
drawing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
sighed
,
smiling
at
him
from
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
,
you
ARE
loaded
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
putting
down
his
brush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
!
''
she
gasped
.
``
That
brazen
Annie
said
she
'd
meet
me
.
SUCH
a
*NL*
weight
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
her
string
bag
and
her
packages
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
bread
done
?
''
she
asked
,
going
to
the
oven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
one
is
soaking
,
''
he
replied
.
``
You
need
n't
look
,
I
've
not
*NL*
forgotten
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
pot
man
!
''
she
said
,
closing
the
oven
door
.
``
You
know
what
a
*NL*
wretch
I
've
said
he
was
?
Well
,
I
do
n't
think
he
's
quite
so
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
was
attentive
to
her
.
She
took
off
her
little
black
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
think
he
ca
n't
make
any
money
--
well
,
it
's
everybody
's
cry
alike
*NL*
nowadays
--
and
it
makes
him
disagreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
ME
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
one
ca
n't
wonder
at
it
.
And
he
let
me
have
--
how
much
do
you
think
*NL*
he
let
me
have
THIS
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
the
dish
out
of
its
rag
of
newspaper
,
and
stood
looking
on
it
*NL*
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
me
!
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
stood
together
gloating
over
the
dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
LOVE
cornflowers
on
things
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
thought
of
the
teapot
you
bought
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
and
three
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fivepence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
enough
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Do
you
know
,
I
fairly
sneaked
off
with
it
.
But
I
'd
been
*NL*
extravagant
,
I
could
n't
afford
any
more
.
And
he
need
n't
have
let
me
have
*NL*
it
if
he
had
n't
wanted
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
need
n't
,
need
he
,
''
said
Paul
,
and
the
two
comforted
each
other
*NL*
from
the
fear
of
having
robbed
the
pot
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
c
'n
have
stewed
fruit
in
it
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
custard
,
or
a
jelly
,
''
said
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
radishes
and
lettuce
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
forget
that
bread
,
''
she
said
,
her
voice
bright
with
glee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
looked
in
the
oven
;
tapped
the
loaf
on
the
base
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
done
,
''
he
said
,
giving
it
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tapped
it
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
,
going
to
unpack
her
bag
.
``
Oh
,
and
I
'm
a
wicked
,
*NL*
extravagant
woman
.
I
know
I
s
'll
come
to
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hopped
to
her
side
eagerly
,
to
see
her
latest
extravagance
.
She
*NL*
unfolded
another
lump
of
newspaper
and
disclosed
some
roots
of
pansies
*NL*
and
of
crimson
daisies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
penn
`
orth
!
''
she
moaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
CHEAP
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
could
n't
afford
it
THIS
week
of
all
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
lovely
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
they
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
giving
way
to
pure
joy
.
``
Paul
,
look
at
*NL*
this
yellow
one
,
is
n't
it
--
and
a
face
just
like
an
old
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
!
''
cried
Paul
,
stooping
to
sniff
.
``
And
smells
that
nice
!
But
he
's
a
*NL*
bit
splashed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
in
the
scullery
,
came
back
with
the
flannel
,
and
carefully
washed
*NL*
the
pansy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
NOW
look
at
him
now
he
's
wet
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
brimful
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
of
Scargill
Street
felt
quite
select
.
At
the
end
where
*NL*
the
Morels
lived
there
were
not
many
young
things
.
So
the
few
were
more
*NL*
united
.
Boys
and
girls
played
together
,
the
girls
joining
in
the
fights
*NL*
and
the
rough
games
,
the
boys
taking
part
in
the
dancing
games
and
rings
*NL*
and
make-belief
of
the
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
and
Paul
and
Arthur
loved
the
winter
evenings
,
when
it
was
not
*NL*
wet
.
They
stayed
indoors
till
the
colliers
were
all
gone
home
,
till
it
*NL*
was
thick
dark
,
and
the
street
would
be
deserted
.
Then
they
tied
their
*NL*
scarves
round
their
necks
,
for
they
scorned
overcoats
,
as
all
the
*NL*
colliers
'
children
did
,
and
went
out
.
The
entry
was
very
dark
,
and
at
*NL*
the
end
the
whole
great
night
opened
out
,
in
a
hollow
,
with
a
little
*NL*
tangle
of
lights
below
where
Minton
pit
lay
,
and
another
far
away
*NL*
opposite
for
Selby
.
The
farthest
tiny
lights
seemed
to
stretch
out
the
*NL*
darkness
for
ever
.
The
children
looked
anxiously
down
the
road
at
the
*NL*
one
lamp-post
,
which
stood
at
the
end
of
the
field
path
.
If
the
little
,
*NL*
luminous
space
were
deserted
,
the
two
boys
felt
genuine
desolation
.
They
*NL*
stood
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
under
the
lamp
,
turning
their
*NL*
backs
on
the
night
,
quite
miserable
,
watching
the
dark
houses
.
Suddenly
*NL*
a
pinafore
under
a
short
coat
was
seen
,
and
a
long-legged
girl
came
*NL*
flying
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
Billy
Pillins
an
'
your
Annie
an
'
Eddie
Dakin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
did
not
matter
so
much
--
there
were
three
now
.
They
set
up
a
game
*NL*
round
the
lamp-post
,
till
the
others
rushed
up
,
yelling
.
Then
the
play
*NL*
went
fast
and
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
only
this
one
lamp-post
.
Behind
was
the
great
scoop
of
*NL*
darkness
,
as
if
all
the
night
were
there
.
In
front
,
another
wide
,
dark
*NL*
way
opened
over
the
hill
brow
.
Occasionally
somebody
came
out
of
this
*NL*
way
and
went
into
the
field
down
the
path
.
In
a
dozen
yards
the
night
*NL*
had
swallowed
them
.
The
children
played
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
brought
exceedingly
close
together
owing
to
their
isolation
.
*NL*
If
a
quarrel
took
place
,
the
whole
play
was
spoilt
.
Arthur
was
very
*NL*
touchy
,
and
Billy
Pillins
--
really
Philips
--
was
worse
.
Then
Paul
had
to
*NL*
side
with
Arthur
,
and
on
Paul
's
side
went
Alice
,
while
Billy
Pillins
*NL*
always
had
Emmie
Limb
and
Eddie
Dakin
to
back
him
up
.
Then
the
six
would
*NL*
fight
,
hate
with
a
fury
of
hatred
,
and
flee
home
in
terror
.
Paul
never
*NL*
forgot
,
after
one
of
these
fierce
internecine
fights
,
seeing
a
big
red
*NL*
moon
lift
itself
up
,
slowly
,
between
the
waste
road
over
the
hilltop
,
*NL*
steadily
,
like
a
great
bird
.
And
he
thought
of
the
Bible
,
that
the
moon
*NL*
should
be
turned
to
blood
.
And
the
next
day
he
made
haste
to
be
friends
*NL*
with
Billy
Pillins
.
And
then
the
wild
,
intense
games
went
on
again
under
*NL*
the
lamp-post
,
surrounded
by
so
much
darkness
.
Mrs.
Morel
,
going
into
*NL*
her
parlour
,
would
hear
the
children
singing
away
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
shoes
are
made
of
Spanish
leather
,
*NL*
My
socks
are
made
of
silk
;
*NL*
I
wear
a
ring
on
every
finger
,
*NL*
I
wash
myself
in
milk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sounded
so
perfectly
absorbed
in
the
game
as
their
voices
came
*NL*
out
of
the
night
,
that
they
had
the
feel
of
wild
creatures
singing
.
*NL*
It
stirred
the
mother
;
and
she
understood
when
they
came
in
at
eight
*NL*
o'clock
,
ruddy
,
with
brilliant
eyes
,
and
quick
,
passionate
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
loved
the
Scargill
Street
house
for
its
openness
,
for
the
great
*NL*
scallop
of
the
world
it
had
in
view
.
On
summer
evenings
the
women
would
*NL*
stand
against
the
field
fence
,
gossiping
,
facing
the
west
,
watching
the
*NL*
sunsets
flare
quickly
out
,
till
the
Derbyshire
hills
ridged
across
the
*NL*
crimson
far
away
,
like
the
black
crest
of
a
newt
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
summer
season
the
pits
never
turned
full
time
,
particularly
the
*NL*
soft
coal
.
Mrs.
Dakin
,
who
lived
next
door
to
Mrs.
Morel
,
going
to
the
*NL*
field
fence
to
shake
her
hearthrug
,
would
spy
men
coming
slowly
up
the
*NL*
hill
.
She
saw
at
once
they
were
colliers
.
Then
she
waited
,
a
tall
,
thin
,
*NL*
shrew-faced
woman
,
standing
on
the
hill
brow
,
almost
like
a
menace
to
*NL*
the
poor
colliers
who
were
toiling
up
.
It
was
only
eleven
o'clock
.
From
*NL*
the
far-off
wooded
hills
the
haze
that
hangs
like
fine
black
crape
at
*NL*
the
back
of
a
summer
morning
had
not
yet
dissipated
.
The
first
man
came
*NL*
to
the
stile
.
``
Chock-chock
!
''
went
the
gate
under
his
thrust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
han
'
yer
knocked
off
?
''
cried
Mrs.
Dakin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
han
,
missis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
as
they
letn
yer
goo
,
''
she
said
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
that
,
''
replied
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
you
know
you
're
flig
to
come
up
again
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
man
went
on
.
Mrs.
Dakin
,
going
up
her
yard
,
spied
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
taking
the
ashes
to
the
ash-pit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
Minton
's
knocked
off
,
missis
,
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
sickenin
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Morel
in
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
But
I
'n
just
seed
Jont
Hutchby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
might
as
well
have
saved
their
shoe-leather
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
And
*NL*
both
women
went
indoors
disgusted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colliers
,
their
faces
scarcely
blackened
,
were
trooping
home
again
.
*NL*
Morel
hated
to
go
back
.
He
loved
the
sunny
morning
.
But
he
had
gone
to
*NL*
pit
to
work
,
and
to
be
sent
home
again
spoilt
his
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
,
at
this
time
!
''
exclaimed
his
wife
,
as
he
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
help
it
,
woman
?
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
've
not
done
half
enough
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
eat
my
bit
o
'
snap
as
I
took
with
me
,
''
he
bawled
*NL*
pathetically
.
He
felt
ignominious
and
sore
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
children
,
coming
home
from
school
,
would
wonder
to
see
their
*NL*
father
eating
with
his
dinner
the
two
thick
slices
of
rather
dry
and
*NL*
dirty
bread-and-butter
that
had
been
to
pit
and
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
my
dad
eating
his
snap
for
now
?
''
asked
Arthur
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
ha'e
it
holled
at
me
if
I
didna
,
''
snorted
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
story
!
''
exclaimed
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
is
it
goin
'
to
be
wasted
?
''
said
Morel
.
``
I
'm
not
such
a
extravagant
*NL*
mortal
as
you
lot
,
with
your
waste
.
If
I
drop
a
bit
of
bread
at
pit
,
in
*NL*
all
the
dust
an
'
dirt
,
I
pick
it
up
an
'
eat
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mice
would
eat
it
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
It
would
n't
be
wasted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
bread-an
'
-
butter
's
not
for
mice
,
either
,
''
said
Morel
.
``
Dirty
or
*NL*
not
dirty
,
I
'd
eat
it
rather
than
it
should
be
wasted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
leave
it
for
the
mice
and
pay
for
it
out
of
your
next
pint
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
might
I
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
very
poor
that
autumn
.
William
had
just
gone
away
to
London
,
*NL*
and
his
mother
missed
his
money
.
He
sent
ten
shillings
once
or
twice
,
*NL*
but
he
had
many
things
to
pay
for
at
first
.
His
letters
came
regularly
*NL*
once
a
week
.
He
wrote
a
good
deal
to
his
mother
,
telling
her
all
his
*NL*
life
,
how
he
made
friends
,
and
was
exchanging
lessons
with
a
Frenchman
,
*NL*
how
he
enjoyed
London
.
His
mother
felt
again
he
was
remaining
to
her
*NL*
just
as
when
he
was
at
home
.
She
wrote
to
him
every
week
her
direct
,
*NL*
rather
witty
letters
.
All
day
long
,
as
she
cleaned
the
house
,
she
*NL*
thought
of
him
.
He
was
in
London
:
he
would
do
well
.
Almost
,
he
was
like
*NL*
her
knight
who
wore
HER
favour
in
the
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
coming
at
Christmas
for
five
days
.
There
had
never
been
such
*NL*
preparations
.
Paul
and
Arthur
scoured
the
land
for
holly
and
evergreens
.
*NL*
Annie
made
the
pretty
paper
hoops
in
the
old-fashioned
way
.
And
there
*NL*
was
unheard-of
extravagance
in
the
larder
.
Mrs.
Morel
made
a
big
and
*NL*
magnificent
cake
.
Then
,
feeling
queenly
,
she
showed
Paul
how
to
blanch
*NL*
almonds
.
He
skinned
the
long
nuts
reverently
,
counting
them
all
,
to
see
*NL*
not
one
was
lost
.
It
was
said
that
eggs
whisked
better
in
a
cold
place
.
*NL*
So
the
boy
stood
in
the
scullery
,
where
the
temperature
was
nearly
at
*NL*
freezing-point
,
and
whisked
and
whisked
,
and
flew
in
excitement
to
his
*NL*
mother
as
the
white
of
egg
grew
stiffer
and
more
snowy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
look
,
mother
!
Is
n't
it
lovely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
balanced
a
bit
on
his
nose
,
then
blew
it
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
do
n't
waste
it
,
''
said
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
was
mad
with
excitement
.
William
was
coming
on
Christmas
Eve
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
surveyed
her
pantry
.
There
was
a
big
plum
cake
,
and
a
rice
*NL*
cake
,
jam
tarts
,
lemon
tarts
,
and
mince-pies
--
two
enormous
dishes
.
She
*NL*
was
finishing
cooking
--
Spanish
tarts
and
cheese-cakes
.
Everywhere
was
*NL*
decorated
.
The
kissing
bunch
of
berried
holly
hung
with
bright
and
*NL*
glittering
things
,
spun
slowly
over
Mrs.
Morel
's
head
as
she
trimmed
her
*NL*
little
tarts
in
the
kitchen
.
A
great
fire
roared
.
There
was
a
scent
of
*NL*
cooked
pastry
.
He
was
due
at
seven
o'clock
,
but
he
would
be
late
.
The
*NL*
three
children
had
gone
to
meet
him
.
She
was
alone
.
But
at
a
quarter
to
*NL*
seven
Morel
came
in
again
.
Neither
wife
nor
husband
spoke
.
He
sat
in
his
*NL*
armchair
,
quite
awkward
with
excitement
,
and
she
quietly
went
on
with
*NL*
her
baking
.
Only
by
the
careful
way
in
which
she
did
things
could
it
be
*NL*
told
how
much
moved
she
was
.
The
clock
ticked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
dost
say
he
's
coming
?
''
Morel
asked
for
the
fifth
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
train
gets
in
at
half-past
six
,
''
she
replied
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
he
'll
be
here
at
ten
past
seven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
bless
you
,
it
'll
be
hours
late
on
the
Midland
,
''
she
said
*NL*
indifferently
.
But
she
hoped
,
by
expecting
him
late
,
to
bring
him
early
.
*NL*
Morel
went
down
the
entry
to
look
for
him
.
Then
he
came
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
,
man
!
''
she
said
.
``
You
're
like
an
ill-sitting
hen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hadna
you
better
be
gettin
'
him
summat
t
'
eat
ready
?
''
asked
the
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
plenty
of
time
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
not
so
much
as
I
can
see
on
,
''
he
answered
,
turning
crossly
in
*NL*
his
chair
.
She
began
to
clear
her
table
.
The
kettle
was
singing
.
They
*NL*
waited
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meantime
the
three
children
were
on
the
platform
at
Sethley
Bridge
,
*NL*
on
the
Midland
main
line
,
two
miles
from
home
.
They
waited
one
hour
.
*NL*
A
train
came
--
he
was
not
there
.
Down
the
line
the
red
and
green
lights
*NL*
shone
.
It
was
very
dark
and
very
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
him
if
the
London
train
's
come
,
''
said
Paul
to
Annie
,
when
they
saw
*NL*
a
man
in
a
tip
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
,
''
said
Annie
.
``
You
be
quiet
--
he
might
send
us
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Paul
was
dying
for
the
man
to
know
they
were
expecting
someone
by
*NL*
the
London
train
:
it
sounded
so
grand
.
Yet
he
was
much
too
much
scared
*NL*
of
broaching
any
man
,
let
alone
one
in
a
peaked
cap
,
to
dare
to
ask
.
The
*NL*
three
children
could
scarcely
go
into
the
waiting-room
for
fear
of
being
*NL*
sent
away
,
and
for
fear
something
should
happen
whilst
they
were
off
the
*NL*
platform
.
Still
they
waited
in
the
dark
and
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
an
hour
an
'
a
half
late
,
''
said
Arthur
pathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Annie
,
``
it
's
Christmas
Eve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
grew
silent
.
He
was
n't
coming
.
They
looked
down
the
darkness
*NL*
of
the
railway
.
There
was
London
!
It
seemed
the
utter-most
of
distance
.
*NL*
They
thought
anything
might
happen
if
one
came
from
London
.
They
were
*NL*
all
too
troubled
to
talk
.
Cold
,
and
unhappy
,
and
silent
,
they
huddled
*NL*
together
on
the
platform
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
after
more
than
two
hours
,
they
saw
the
lights
of
an
engine
*NL*
peering
round
,
away
down
the
darkness
.
A
porter
ran
out
.
The
children
*NL*
drew
back
with
beating
hearts
.
A
great
train
,
bound
for
Manchester
,
drew
*NL*
up
.
Two
doors
opened
,
and
from
one
of
them
,
William
.
They
flew
to
him
.
*NL*
He
handed
parcels
to
them
cheerily
,
and
immediately
began
to
explain
*NL*
that
this
great
train
had
stopped
for
HIS
sake
at
such
a
small
station
*NL*
as
Sethley
Bridge
:
it
was
not
booked
to
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
parents
were
getting
anxious
.
The
table
was
set
,
the
chop
*NL*
was
cooked
,
everything
was
ready
.
Mrs.
Morel
put
on
her
black
apron
.
*NL*
She
was
wearing
her
best
dress
.
Then
she
sat
,
pretending
to
read
.
The
*NL*
minutes
were
a
torture
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
said
Morel
.
``
It
's
an
hour
an
'
a
ha'ef
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
those
children
waiting
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Th
'
train
canna
ha
'
come
in
yet
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
,
on
Christmas
Eve
they
're
HOURS
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
a
bit
cross
with
each
other
,
so
gnawed
with
anxiety
.
The
*NL*
ash
tree
moaned
outside
in
a
cold
,
raw
wind
.
And
all
that
space
of
night
*NL*
from
London
home
!
Mrs.
Morel
suffered
.
The
slight
click
of
the
works
*NL*
inside
the
clock
irritated
her
.
It
was
getting
so
late
;
it
was
getting
*NL*
unbearable
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
,
and
a
footstep
in
the
entry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
's
here
!
''
cried
Morel
,
jumping
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
stood
back
.
The
mother
ran
a
few
steps
towards
the
door
and
*NL*
waited
.
There
was
a
rush
and
a
patter
of
feet
,
the
door
burst
open
.
*NL*
William
was
there
.
He
dropped
his
Gladstone
bag
and
took
his
mother
in
*NL*
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mater
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
boy
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
two
seconds
,
no
longer
,
she
clasped
him
and
kissed
him
.
Then
she
*NL*
withdrew
and
said
,
trying
to
be
quite
normal
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
late
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
I
!
''
he
cried
,
turning
to
his
father
.
``
Well
,
dad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
shook
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
lad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
's
eyes
were
wet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
tha
'd
niver
be
commin
'
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'd
come
!
''
exclaimed
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
son
turned
round
to
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
look
well
,
''
she
said
proudly
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
I
should
think
so
--
coming
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
fine
fellow
,
big
,
straight
,
and
fearless-looking
.
He
looked
*NL*
round
at
the
evergreens
and
the
kissing
bunch
,
and
the
little
tarts
that
*NL*
lay
in
their
tins
on
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
jove
!
mother
,
it
's
not
different
!
''
he
said
,
as
if
in
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
was
still
for
a
second
.
Then
he
suddenly
sprang
forward
,
*NL*
picked
a
tart
from
the
hearth
,
and
pushed
it
whole
into
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
did
iver
you
see
such
a
parish
oven
!
''
the
father
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
brought
them
endless
presents
.
Every
penny
he
had
he
had
spent
*NL*
on
them
.
There
was
a
sense
of
luxury
overflowing
in
the
house
.
For
his
*NL*
mother
there
was
an
umbrella
with
gold
on
the
pale
handle
.
She
kept
*NL*
it
to
her
dying
day
,
and
would
have
lost
anything
rather
than
that
.
*NL*
Everybody
had
something
gorgeous
,
and
besides
,
there
were
pounds
of
*NL*
unknown
sweets
:
Turkish
delight
,
crystallised
pineapple
,
and
such-like
*NL*
things
which
,
the
children
thought
,
only
the
splendour
of
London
could
*NL*
provide
.
And
Paul
boasted
of
these
sweets
among
his
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Real
pineapple
,
cut
off
in
slices
,
and
then
turned
into
crystal
--
fair
*NL*
grand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
was
mad
with
happiness
in
the
family
.
Home
was
home
,
and
they
*NL*
loved
it
with
a
passion
of
love
,
whatever
the
suffering
had
been
.
There
*NL*
were
parties
,
there
were
rejoicings
.
People
came
in
to
see
William
,
to
*NL*
see
what
difference
London
had
made
to
him
.
And
they
all
found
him
``
such
*NL*
a
gentleman
,
and
SUCH
a
fine
fellow
,
my
word
''
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
went
away
again
the
children
retired
to
various
places
to
weep
*NL*
alone
.
Morel
went
to
bed
in
misery
,
and
Mrs.
Morel
felt
as
if
she
were
*NL*
numbed
by
some
drug
,
as
if
her
feelings
were
paralysed
.
She
loved
him
*NL*
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
the
office
of
a
lawyer
connected
with
a
large
shipping
firm
,
*NL*
and
at
the
midsummer
his
chief
offered
him
a
trip
in
the
Mediterranean
*NL*
on
one
of
the
boats
,
for
quite
a
small
cost
.
Mrs.
Morel
wrote
:
``
Go
,
go
,
*NL*
my
boy
.
You
may
never
have
a
chance
again
,
and
I
should
love
to
think
of
*NL*
you
cruising
there
in
the
Mediterranean
almost
better
than
to
have
you
*NL*
at
home
.
''
But
William
came
home
for
his
fortnight
's
holiday
.
Not
even
*NL*
the
Mediterranean
,
which
pulled
at
all
his
young
man
's
desire
to
travel
,
*NL*
and
at
his
poor
man
's
wonder
at
the
glamorous
south
,
could
take
him
away
*NL*
when
he
might
come
home
.
That
compensated
his
mother
for
much

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
PAUL
LAUNCHES
INTO
LIFE
*NL*
*NL*
MOREL
was
rather
a
heedless
man
,
careless
of
danger
.
So
he
had
endless
*NL*
accidents
.
Now
,
when
Mrs.
Morel
heard
the
rattle
of
an
empty
coal-cart
*NL*
cease
at
her
entry-end
,
she
ran
into
the
parlour
to
look
,
expecting
*NL*
almost
to
see
her
husband
seated
in
the
waggon
,
his
face
grey
under
his
*NL*
dirt
,
his
body
limp
and
sick
with
some
hurt
or
other
.
If
it
were
he
,
she
*NL*
would
run
out
to
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
year
after
William
went
to
London
,
and
just
after
Paul
had
left
*NL*
school
,
before
he
got
work
,
Mrs.
Morel
was
upstairs
and
her
son
was
*NL*
painting
in
the
kitchen
--
he
was
very
clever
with
his
brush
--
when
there
*NL*
came
a
knock
at
the
door
.
Crossly
he
put
down
his
brush
to
go
.
At
the
*NL*
same
moment
his
mother
opened
a
window
upstairs
and
looked
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
pit-lad
in
his
dirt
stood
on
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
Walter
Morel
's
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
guessed
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mester
's
got
hurt
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
dear
me
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
It
's
a
wonder
if
he
had
n't
,
lad
.
And
*NL*
what
's
he
done
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
for
sure

but
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
me
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Eh
,
dear
,
what
a
one
he
is
!
There
's
*NL*
not
five
minutes
of
peace
,
I
'll
be
hanged
if
there
is
!
His
thumb
's
*NL*
nearly
better
,
and
now
--
Did
you
see
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
seed
him
at
th

An

up

*NL*

wor
in

But
he
shouted
like
anythink
when
Doctor
Fraser
*NL*
examined
him
i

th

lamp
cabin

an
'
cossed
an

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
faltered
to
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
WOULD
want
to
come
home
,
so
that
I
can
have
all
the
bother
.
Thank
*NL*
you
,
my
lad

Eh
,
dear
,
if
I
'm
not
sick
--
sick
and
surfeited
,
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
downstairs
.
Paul
had
mechanically
resumed
his
painting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
must
be
pretty
bad
if
they
've
taken
him
to
the
hospital
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
.
``
But
what
a
CARELESS
creature
he
is
!
OTHER
men
do
n't
have
all
*NL*
these
accidents

Yes
,
he
WOULD
want
to
put
all
the
burden
on
me
.
Eh
,
*NL*
dear
,
just
as
we
WERE
getting
easy
a
bit
at
last
.
Put
those
things
away
,
*NL*
there
's
no
time
to
be
painting
now
.
What
time
is
there
a
train
?
I
know
I
*NL*
s
'll
have
to
go
trailing
to
Keston
.
I
s
'll
have
to
leave
that
bedroom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
finish
it
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't

I
shall
catch
the
seven
o'clock
back

I
should
think

Oh
,
*NL*
my
blessed
heart
,
the
fuss
and
commotion
he
'll
make
!
And
those
granite
*NL*
setts
at
Tinder
Hill
--
he
might
well
call
them
kidney
pebbles
--
they
'll
*NL*
jolt
him
almost
to
bits
.
I
wonder
why
they
ca
n't
mend
them
,
the
state
*NL*
they
're
in
,
an
'
all
the
men
as
go
across
in

ambulance

You
'd
think

they

have
a

here

The
men
bought
the
ground
,
and
,
my
sirs
,
*NL*
there
'd
be
accidents
enough
to
keep
it
going

But
no
,
they
must
trail
*NL*
them
ten
miles
in
a
slow
ambulance
to
Nottingham

It
's
a
crying
shame

Oh

the
fuss

I

Poor
beggar

he
'll
wish
himself
anywhere
rather
.
*NL*
But
he
'll
look
after
him

I
know

Now
there
's
no
telling
how
long
he
'll
*NL*
be
stuck
in
that
hospital
--
and
WO
N'T
he
hate
it

But
if
it
's
only
his
*NL*
leg
it
's
not
so
bad

''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
she
was
getting
ready
.
Hurriedly
taking
off
her
bodice
,
she
*NL*
crouched
at
the
boiler
while
the
water
ran
slowly
into
her
lading-can
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
this
boiler
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
*NL*
wriggling
the
handle
impatiently
.
She
had
very
handsome
,
strong
arms
,
*NL*
rather
surprising
on
a
smallish
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
cleared
away
,
put
on
the
kettle
,
and
set
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
n't
a
train
till
four-twenty
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
've
time
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
I
have
n't
!
''
she
cried
,
blinking
at
him
over
the
towel
as
she
*NL*
wiped
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
have
.
You
must
drink
a
cup
of
tea
at
any
rate

Should
I
come
*NL*
with
you
to
Keston
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
with

What
for

I

Now

what
have
I

take
*NL*
him
?
Eh
,
dear
!
His
clean
shirt
--
and
it
's
a
blessing
it
IS
clean
.
But
it
*NL*
had
better
be
aired
.
And
stockings
--
he
wo
n't
want
them
--
and
a
towel
,
I
*NL*
suppose
;
and
handkerchiefs
.
Now
what
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
comb
,
a
knife
and
fork
and
spoon
,

said
Paul
.
His
father
had
been
in
*NL*
the
hospital
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
knows
what
sort
of
state
his
feet
were
in

''
continued
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
,
as
she
combed
her
long
brown
hair
,
that
was
fine
as
silk
,
and
*NL*
was
touched
now
with
grey
.
``
He
's
very
particular
to
wash
himself
to
the
*NL*
waist
,
but
below
he
thinks
does
n't
matter
.
But
there
,
I
suppose
they
see
*NL*
plenty
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
had
laid
the
table
.
He
cut
his
mother
one
or
two
pieces
of
very
*NL*
thin
bread
and
butter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
''
he
said
,
putting
her
cup
of
tea
in
her
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
be
bothered
!
''
she
exclaimed
crossly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
've
got
to
,
so
there
,
now
it
's
put
out
ready
,
''
he
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
sat
down
and
sipped
her
tea
,
and
ate
a
little
,
in
silence
.
She
*NL*
was
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
she
was
gone
,
to
walk
the
two
and
a
half
miles
to
*NL*
Keston
Station
.
All
the
things
she
was
taking
him
she
had
in
her
bulging
*NL*
string
bag
.
Paul
watched
her
go
up
the
road
between
the
hedges
--
a
*NL*
little
,
quick-stepping
figure
,
and
his
heart
ached
for
her
,
that
she
was
*NL*
thrust
forward
again
into
pain
and
trouble
.
And
she
,
tripping
so
quickly
*NL*
in
her
anxiety
,
felt
at
the
back
of
her
her
son
's
heart
waiting
on
her
,
*NL*
felt
him
bearing
what
part
of
the
burden
he
could
,
even
supporting
her
.
*NL*
And
when
she
was
at
the
hospital
,
she
thought
:
``
It
WILL
upset
that
lad
*NL*
when
I
tell
him
how
bad
it
is
.
I
'd
better
be
careful
.
''
And
when
she
was
*NL*
trudging
home
again
,
she
felt
he
was
coming
to
share
her
burden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
bad
?
''
asked
Paul
,
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
bad
enough
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sighed
and
sat
down
,
undoing
her
bonnet-strings
.
Her
son
watched
her
*NL*
face
as
it
was
lifted
,
and
her
small
,
work-hardened
hands
fingering
at
*NL*
the
bow
under
her
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
answered
,
``
it
's
not
really
dangerous
,
but
the
nurse
says
*NL*
it
's
a
dreadful
smash
.
You
see
,
a
great
piece
of
rock
fell
on
his
*NL*
leg
--
here
--
and
it
's
a
compound
fracture
.
There
are
pieces
of
bone
*NL*
sticking
through
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ugh
--
how
horrid
!
''
exclaimed
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
''
she
continued
,
``
of
course
he
says
he
's
going
to
die

it
would
n't
*NL*
be
him
if

`
I

done

my
lass

he
said
,
looking
at
me
.
*NL*
`
Do
n't
be
so
silly

I
said
to
him
.
`
You
're
not
going

die

a
broken
*NL*
leg

however
badly
it
's
smashed

I
s

niver
come
out
of
`
ere
but
in
*NL*
a
wooden
box

he
groaned
.
`
Well
,

I
said
,
`
if
you
want
them
to
carry
*NL*
you
into
the
garden
in
a
wooden
box
,
when
you
're
better

I
've
no
doubt
*NL*
they
will

`
If
we
think
it
's
good
for
him

said
the
Sister

She
's
an
*NL*
awfully
nice
Sister
,
but
rather
strict
.

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
took
off
her
bonnet
.
The
children
waited
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
he
IS
bad
,
''
she
continued
,
``
and
he
will
be
.
It
's
a
great
*NL*
shock
,
and
he
's
lost
a
lot
of
blood
;
and
,
of
course
,
it
IS
a
very
*NL*
dangerous
smash

It
's
not
at
all
sure
that
it
will
mend
so
easily

And
*NL*
then
there
's
the
fever
and
the
mortification

if
it
took
bad
ways
he
'd
*NL*
quickly
be
gone

But
there
,
he
's
a
clean-blooded
man
,
with
wonderful
*NL*
healing
flesh
,
and
so
I
see
no
reason
why
it
SHOULD
take
bad
ways

Of
*NL*
course
there
's
a
wound

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
pale
now
with
emotion
and
anxiety
.
The
three
children
realised
*NL*
that
it
was
very
bad
for
their
father
,
and
the
house
was
silent
,
*NL*
anxious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
always
gets
better

said
Paul
after
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
tell
him
,
''
said
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
moved
about
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
really
looked
nearly
done
for

she
said
.
``
But
the
Sister
says
*NL*
that
is
the
pain

*NL*
*NL*
Annie
took
away
her
mother
's
coat
and
bonnet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
looked
at
me
when
I
came
away

I
said
:

I

'll
have
to
go
now

*NL*
Walter

because
of
the
train

And
he
looked
at
me
.
It
*NL*
seems
hard

''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
took
up
his
brush
again
and
went
on
painting
.
Arthur
went
outside
*NL*
for
some
coal
.
Annie
sat
looking
dismal
.
And
Mrs.
Morel
,
in
her
little
*NL*
rocking-chair
that
her
husband
had
made
for
her
when
the
first
baby
was
*NL*
coming
,
remained
motionless
,
brooding
.
She
was
grieved
,
and
bitterly
*NL*
sorry
for
the
man
who
was
hurt
so
much
.
But
still
,
in
her
heart
of
*NL*
hearts
,
where
the
love
should
have
burned
,
there
was
a
blank
.
Now
,
when
*NL*
all
her
woman
's
pity
was
roused
to
its
full
extent
,
when
she
would
have
*NL*
slaved
herself
to
death
to
nurse
him
and
to
save
him
,
when
she
would
*NL*
have
taken
the
pain
herself
,
if
she
could
,
somewhere
far
away
inside
*NL*
her
,
she
felt
indifferent
to
him
and
to
his
suffering
.
It
hurt
her
*NL*
most
of
all
,
this
failure
to
love
him
,
even
when
he
roused
her
strong
*NL*
emotions
.
She
brooded
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
,

she
said
suddenly
,
``
when
I
'd
got
halfway
to
Keston
,
I
found
*NL*
I
'd
come
out
in
my
working
boots
--
and
LOOK
at
them
.
''
They
were
an
old
*NL*
pair
of
Paul
's
,
brown
and
rubbed
through
at
the
toes
.
``
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
what
to
do
with
myself
,
for
shame
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
when
Annie
and
Arthur
were
at
school
,
Mrs.
Morel
talked
*NL*
again
to
her
son
,
who
was
helping
her
with
her
housework
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
Barker
at
the
hospital
.
He
did
look
bad
,
poor
little
fellow
!
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
I
said
to
him
,
`
what
sort
of
a
journey
did
you
have
with
him
?
'
*NL*
`
Dunna
ax
me
,
missis
!
'
he
said
.
`
Ay
,
'
I
said
,
'
I
know
what
he
'd
be
.
'
*NL*
`
But
it
WOR
bad
for
him
,
Mrs.
Morel
,
it
WOR
that
!
'
he
said
.
'
I
know
,
'
I
*NL*
said
.
`
At
ivry
jolt
I
thought
my
`
eart
would
ha
'
flown
clean
out
o
'
my
*NL*
mouth
,
'
he
said
.
`
An
'
the
scream
'
e
gives
sometimes
!
Missis
,
not
for
a
*NL*
fortune
would
I
go
through
wi
'
it
again
.
'
'
I
can
quite
understand
it
,
'
*NL*
I
said
.
`
It
's
a
nasty
job
,
though
,
'
he
said
,
`
an
'
one
as
'll
be
a
long
*NL*
while
afore
it
's
right
again
.
'
`
I
'm
afraid
it
will
,
'
I
said
.
I
like
Mr.
*NL*
Barker
--
I
DO
like
him
.
There
's
something
so
manly
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
resumed
his
task
silently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
of
course
,
''
Mrs.
Morel
continued
,
``
for
a
man
like
your
father
,
*NL*
the
hospital
IS
hard
.
He
CA
N'T
understand
rules
and
regulations
.
And
he
*NL*
wo
n't
let
anybody
else
touch
him
,
not
if
he
can
help
it
.
When
he
smashed
*NL*
the
muscles
of
his
thigh
,
and
it
had
to
be
dressed
four
times
a
day
,
*NL*
WOULD
he
let
anybody
but
me
or
his
mother
do
it
?
He
would
n't
.
So
,
of
*NL*
course
,
he
'll
suffer
in
there
with
the
nurses
.
And
I
did
n't
like
leaving
*NL*
him
.
I
'm
sure
,
when
I
kissed
him
an
'
came
away
,
it
seemed
a
shame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
talked
to
her
son
,
almost
as
if
she
were
thinking
aloud
to
him
,
*NL*
and
he
took
it
in
as
best
he
could
,
by
sharing
her
trouble
to
lighten
*NL*
it
.
And
in
the
end
she
shared
almost
everything
with
him
without
*NL*
knowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
had
a
very
bad
time
.
For
a
week
he
was
in
a
critical
condition
.
*NL*
Then
he
began
to
mend
.
And
then
,
knowing
he
was
going
to
get
better
,
the
*NL*
whole
family
sighed
with
relief
,
and
proceeded
to
live
happily
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not
badly
off
whilst
Morel
was
in
the
hospital
.
There
were
*NL*
fourteen
shillings
a
week
from
the
pit
,
ten
shillings
from
the
sick
*NL*
club
,
and
five
shillings
from
the
Disability
Fund
;
and
then
every
week
*NL*
the
butties
had
something
for
Mrs.
Morel
--
five
or
seven
shillings
--
so
*NL*
that
she
was
quite
well
to
do
.
And
whilst
Morel
was
progressing
*NL*
favourably
in
the
hospital
,
the
family
was
extraordinarily
happy
and
*NL*
peaceful
.
On
Saturdays
and
Wednesdays
Mrs.
Morel
went
to
Nottingham
to
*NL*
see
her
husband
.
Then
she
always
brought
back
some
little
thing
:
a
small
*NL*
tube
of
paints
for
Paul
,
or
some
thick
paper
;
a
couple
of
postcards
for
*NL*
Annie
,
that
the
whole
family
rejoiced
over
for
days
before
the
girl
was
*NL*
allowed
to
send
them
away
;
or
a
fret-saw
for
Arthur
,
or
a
bit
of
pretty
*NL*
wood
.
She
described
her
adventures
into
the
big
shops
with
joy
.
Soon
the
*NL*
folk
in
the
picture-shop
knew
her
,
and
knew
about
Paul
.
The
girl
in
*NL*
the
book-shop
took
a
keen
interest
in
her
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
full
of
*NL*
information
when
she
got
home
from
Nottingham
.
The
three
sat
round
till
*NL*
bed-time
,
listening
,
putting
in
,
arguing
.
Then
Paul
often
raked
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
the
man
in
the
house
now
,
''
he
used
to
say
to
his
mother
with
joy
.
*NL*
They
learned
how
perfectly
peaceful
the
home
could
be
.
And
they
*NL*
almost
regretted
--
though
none
of
them
would
have
owned
to
such
*NL*
callousness
--
that
their
father
was
soon
coming
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
now
fourteen
,
and
was
looking
for
work
.
He
was
a
rather
small
*NL*
and
rather
finely-made
boy
,
with
dark
brown
hair
and
light
blue
eyes
.
*NL*
His
face
had
already
lost
its
youthful
chubbiness
,
and
was
becoming
*NL*
somewhat
like
William
's
--
rough-featured
,
almost
rugged
--
and
it
was
*NL*
extraordinarily
mobile
.
Usually
he
looked
as
if
he
saw
things
,
was
full
*NL*
of
life
,
and
warm
;
then
his
smile
,
like
his
mother
's
,
came
suddenly
and
*NL*
was
very
lovable
;
and
then
,
when
there
was
any
clog
in
his
soul
's
quick
*NL*
running
,
his
face
went
stupid
and
ugly
.
He
was
the
sort
of
boy
that
*NL*
becomes
a
clown
and
a
lout
as
soon
as
he
is
not
understood
,
or
feels
*NL*
himself
held
cheap
;
and
,
again
,
is
adorable
at
the
first
touch
of
*NL*
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
suffered
very
much
from
the
first
contact
with
anything
.
When
he
was
*NL*
seven
,
the
starting
school
had
been
a
nightmare
and
a
torture
to
him
.
*NL*
But
afterwards
he
liked
it
.
And
now
that
he
felt
he
had
to
go
out
into
*NL*
life
,
he
went
through
agonies
of
shrinking
self-consciousness
.
He
was
*NL*
quite
a
clever
painter
for
a
boy
of
his
years
,
and
he
knew
some
French
*NL*
and
German
and
mathematics
that
Mr.
Heaton
had
taught
him
.
But
nothing
*NL*
he
had
was
of
any
commercial
value
.
He
was
not
strong
enough
for
heavy
*NL*
manual
work
,
his
mother
said
.
He
did
not
care
for
making
things
with
his
*NL*
hands
,
preferred
racing
about
,
or
making
excursions
into
the
country
,
or
*NL*
reading
,
or
painting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
to
be
?
''
his
mother
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
no
answer
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
quite
truthfully
the
only
answer
he
could
give
.
His
ambition
,
*NL*
as
far
as
this
world
's
gear
went
,
was
quietly
to
earn
his
thirty
or
*NL*
thirty-five
shillings
a
week
somewhere
near
home
,
and
then
,
when
his
*NL*
father
died
,
have
a
cottage
with
his
mother
,
paint
and
go
out
as
he
*NL*
liked
,
and
live
happy
ever
after
.
That
was
his
programme
as
far
as
doing
*NL*
things
went
.
But
he
was
proud
within
himself
,
measuring
people
against
*NL*
himself
,
and
placing
them
,
inexorably
.
And
he
thought
that
PERHAPS
he
*NL*
might
also
make
a
painter
,
the
real
thing
.
But
that
he
left
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
his
mother
,
``
you
must
look
in
the
paper
for
the
*NL*
advertisements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
.
It
seemed
to
him
a
bitter
humiliation
and
an
anguish
*NL*
to
go
through
.
But
he
said
nothing
.
When
he
got
up
in
the
morning
,
his
*NL*
whole
being
was
knotted
up
over
this
one
thought
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
to
go
and
look
for
advertisements
for
a
job
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
stood
in
front
of
the
morning
,
that
thought
,
killing
all
joy
and
even
*NL*
life
,
for
him
.
His
heart
felt
like
a
tight
knot
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
at
ten
o'clock
,
he
set
off
.
He
was
supposed
to
be
a
queer
,
*NL*
quiet
child
.
Going
up
the
sunny
street
of
the
little
town
,
he
felt
as
*NL*
if
all
the
folk
he
met
said
to
themselves
:
``
He
's
going
to
the
Co-op
.
*NL*
reading-room
to
look
in
the
papers
for
a
place
.
He
ca
n't
get
a
job
.
I
*NL*
suppose
he
's
living
on
his
mother
.
''
Then
he
crept
up
the
stone
stairs
*NL*
behind
the
drapery
shop
at
the
Co-op.
,
and
peeped
in
the
reading-room
.
*NL*
Usually
one
or
two
men
were
there
,
either
old
,
useless
fellows
,
or
*NL*
colliers
``
on
the
club
''
.
So
he
entered
,
full
of
shrinking
and
suffering
*NL*
when
they
looked
up
,
seated
himself
at
the
table
,
and
pretended
to
scan
*NL*
the
news
.
He
knew
they
would
think
:
``
What
does
a
lad
of
thirteen
want
in
*NL*
a
reading-room
with
a
newspaper
?
''
and
he
suffered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
looked
wistfully
out
of
the
window
.
Already
he
was
a
prisoner
*NL*
of
industrialism
.
Large
sunflowers
stared
over
the
old
red
wall
of
the
*NL*
garden
opposite
,
looking
in
their
jolly
way
down
on
the
women
who
*NL*
were
hurrying
with
something
for
dinner
.
The
valley
was
full
of
corn
,
*NL*
brightening
in
the
sun
.
Two
collieries
,
among
the
fields
,
waved
their
*NL*
small
white
plumes
of
steam
.
Far
off
on
the
hills
were
the
woods
of
*NL*
Annesley
,
dark
and
fascinating
.
Already
his
heart
went
down
.
He
was
*NL*
being
taken
into
bondage
.
His
freedom
in
the
beloved
home
valley
was
*NL*
going
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brewers
'
waggons
came
rolling
up
from
Keston
with
enormous
barrels
,
*NL*
four
a
side
,
like
beans
in
a
burst
bean-pod
.
The
waggoner
,
throned
*NL*
aloft
,
rolling
massively
in
his
seat
,
was
not
so
much
below
Paul
's
eye
.
*NL*
The
man
's
hair
,
on
his
small
,
bullet
head
,
was
bleached
almost
white
by
*NL*
the
sun
,
and
on
his
thick
red
arms
,
rocking
idly
on
his
sack
apron
,
the
*NL*
white
hairs
glistened
.
His
red
face
shone
and
was
almost
asleep
with
*NL*
sunshine
.
The
horses
,
handsome
and
brown
,
went
on
by
themselves
,
looking
*NL*
by
far
the
masters
of
the
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
wished
he
were
stupid
.
``
I
wish
,
''
he
thought
to
himself
,
``
I
was
fat
*NL*
like
him
,
and
like
a
dog
in
the
sun
.
I
wish
I
was
a
pig
and
a
brewer
's
*NL*
waggoner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
the
room
being
at
last
empty
,
he
would
hastily
copy
an
*NL*
advertisement
on
a
scrap
of
paper
,
then
another
,
and
slip
out
in
immense
*NL*
relief
.
His
mother
would
scan
over
his
copies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
may
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
William
had
written
out
a
letter
of
application
,
couched
in
admirable
*NL*
business
language
,
which
Paul
copied
,
with
variations
.
The
boy
's
*NL*
handwriting
was
execrable
,
so
that
William
,
who
did
all
things
well
,
got
*NL*
into
a
fever
of
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
brother
was
becoming
quite
swanky
.
In
London
he
found
that
he
*NL*
could
associate
with
men
far
above
his
Bestwood
friends
in
station
.
Some
*NL*
of
the
clerks
in
the
office
had
studied
for
the
law
,
and
were
more
or
*NL*
less
going
through
a
kind
of
apprenticeship
.
William
always
made
friends
*NL*
among
men
wherever
he
went
,
he
was
so
jolly
.
Therefore
he
was
soon
*NL*
visiting
and
staying
in
houses
of
men
who
,
in
Bestwood
,
would
have
*NL*
looked
down
on
the
unapproachable
bank
manager
,
and
would
merely
have
*NL*
called
indifferently
on
the
Rector
.
So
he
began
to
fancy
himself
as
a
*NL*
great
gun
.
He
was
,
indeed
,
rather
surprised
at
the
ease
with
which
he
*NL*
became
a
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
was
glad
,
he
seemed
so
pleased
.
And
his
lodging
in
*NL*
Walthamstow
was
so
dreary
.
But
now
there
seemed
to
come
a
kind
of
fever
*NL*
into
the
young
man
's
letters
.
He
was
unsettled
by
all
the
change
,
he
did
*NL*
not
stand
firm
on
his
own
feet
,
but
seemed
to
spin
rather
giddily
on
the
*NL*
quick
current
of
the
new
life
.
His
mother
was
anxious
for
him
.
She
could
*NL*
feel
him
losing
himself
.
He
had
danced
and
gone
to
the
theatre
,
boated
*NL*
on
the
river
,
been
out
with
friends
;
and
she
knew
he
sat
up
afterwards
*NL*
in
his
cold
bedroom
grinding
away
at
Latin
,
because
he
intended
to
get
*NL*
on
in
his
office
,
and
in
the
law
as
much
as
he
could
.
He
never
sent
his
*NL*
mother
any
money
now
.
It
was
all
taken
,
the
little
he
had
,
for
his
own
*NL*
life
.
And
she
did
not
want
any
,
except
sometimes
,
when
she
was
in
a
*NL*
tight
corner
,
and
when
ten
shillings
would
have
saved
her
much
worry
.
*NL*
She
still
dreamed
of
William
,
and
of
what
he
would
do
,
with
herself
*NL*
behind
him
.
Never
for
a
minute
would
she
admit
to
herself
how
heavy
and
*NL*
anxious
her
heart
was
because
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Also
he
talked
a
good
deal
now
of
a
girl
he
had
met
at
a
dance
,
a
*NL*
handsome
brunette
,
quite
young
,
and
a
lady
,
after
whom
the
men
were
*NL*
running
thick
and
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
you
would
run
,
my
boy
,
''
his
mother
wrote
to
him
,
``
unless
*NL*
you
saw
all
the
other
men
chasing
her
too
.
You
feel
safe
enough
and
vain
*NL*
enough
in
a
crowd
.
But
take
care
,
and
see
how
you
feel
when
you
find
*NL*
yourself
alone
,
and
in
triumph
.
''
William
resented
these
things
,
and
*NL*
continued
the
chase
.
He
had
taken
the
girl
on
the
river
.
``
If
you
saw
*NL*
her
,
mother
,
you
would
know
how
I
feel
.
Tall
and
elegant
,
with
the
*NL*
clearest
of
clear
,
transparent
olive
complexions
,
hair
as
black
as
jet
,
*NL*
and
such
grey
eyes
--
bright
,
mocking
,
like
lights
on
water
at
night
.
It
*NL*
is
all
very
well
to
be
a
bit
satirical
till
you
see
her
.
And
she
dresses
*NL*
as
well
as
any
woman
in
London
.
I
tell
you
,
your
son
does
n't
half
put
*NL*
his
head
up
when
she
goes
walking
down
Piccadilly
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
wondered
,
in
her
heart
,
if
her
son
did
not
go
walking
down
*NL*
Piccadilly
with
an
elegant
figure
and
fine
clothes
,
rather
than
with
*NL*
a
woman
who
was
near
to
him
.
But
she
congratulated
him
in
her
doubtful
*NL*
fashion
.
And
,
as
she
stood
over
the
washing-tub
,
the
mother
brooded
over
*NL*
her
son
.
She
saw
him
saddled
with
an
elegant
and
expensive
wife
,
earning
*NL*
little
money
,
dragging
along
and
getting
draggled
in
some
small
,
ugly
*NL*
house
in
a
suburb
.
``
But
there
,
''
she
told
herself
,
``
I
am
very
likely
*NL*
a
silly
--
meeting
trouble
halfway
.
''
Nevertheless
,
the
load
of
anxiety
*NL*
scarcely
ever
left
her
heart
,
lest
William
should
do
the
wrong
thing
by
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
Paul
was
bidden
call
upon
Thomas
Jordan
,
Manufacturer
of
*NL*
Surgical
Appliances
,
at
21
,
Spaniel
Row
,
Nottingham
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
all
*NL*
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
!
''
she
cried
,
her
eyes
shining
.
``
You
've
only
written
four
*NL*
letters
,
and
the
third
is
answered
.
You
're
lucky
,
my
boy
,
as
I
always
*NL*
said
you
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
looked
at
the
picture
of
a
wooden
leg
,
adorned
with
elastic
*NL*
stockings
and
other
appliances
,
that
figured
on
Mr.
Jordan
's
notepaper
,
*NL*
and
he
felt
alarmed
.
He
had
not
known
that
elastic
stockings
existed
.
*NL*
And
he
seemed
to
feel
the
business
world
,
with
its
regulated
system
of
*NL*
values
,
and
its
impersonality
,
and
he
dreaded
it
.
It
seemed
monstrous
*NL*
also
that
a
business
could
be
run
on
wooden
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
and
son
set
off
together
one
Tuesday
morning
.
It
was
August
and
*NL*
blazing
hot
.
Paul
walked
with
something
screwed
up
tight
inside
him
.
*NL*
He
would
have
suffered
much
physical
pain
rather
than
this
unreasonable
*NL*
suffering
at
being
exposed
to
strangers
,
to
be
accepted
or
rejected
.
Yet
*NL*
he
chattered
away
with
his
mother
.
He
would
never
have
confessed
to
her
*NL*
how
he
suffered
over
these
things
,
and
she
only
partly
guessed
.
She
*NL*
was
gay
,
like
a
sweetheart
.
She
stood
in
front
of
the
ticket-office
at
*NL*
Bestwood
,
and
Paul
watched
her
take
from
her
purse
the
money
for
the
*NL*
tickets
.
As
he
saw
her
hands
in
their
old
black
kid
gloves
getting
the
*NL*
silver
out
of
the
worn
purse
,
his
heart
contracted
with
pain
of
love
of
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
quite
excited
,
and
quite
gay
.
He
suffered
because
she
WOULD
talk
*NL*
aloud
in
presence
of
the
other
travellers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
look
at
that
silly
cow
!
''
she
said
,
``
careering
round
as
if
it
*NL*
thought
it
was
a
circus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
most
likely
a
bottfly
,
''
he
said
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
what
?
''
she
asked
brightly
and
unashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
thought
a
while
.
He
was
sensible
all
the
time
of
having
her
*NL*
opposite
him
.
Suddenly
their
eyes
met
,
and
she
smiled
to
him
--
a
rare
,
*NL*
intimate
smile
,
beautiful
with
brightness
and
love
.
Then
each
looked
out
*NL*
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sixteen
slow
miles
of
railway
journey
passed
.
The
mother
and
son
*NL*
walked
down
Station
Street
,
feeling
the
excitement
of
lovers
having
an
*NL*
adventure
together
.
In
Carrington
Street
they
stopped
to
hang
over
the
*NL*
parapet
and
look
at
the
barges
on
the
canal
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
like
Venice
,
''
he
said
,
seeing
the
sunshine
on
the
water
that
*NL*
lay
between
high
factory
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
she
answered
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
enjoyed
the
shops
immensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
see
that
blouse
,
''
she
would
say
,
``
would
n't
that
just
suit
our
*NL*
Annie
?
And
for
one-and-eleven-three
.
Is
n't
that
cheap
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
made
of
needlework
as
well
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
plenty
of
time
,
so
they
did
not
hurry
.
The
town
was
strange
*NL*
and
delightful
to
them
.
But
the
boy
was
tied
up
inside
in
a
knot
of
*NL*
apprehension
.
He
dreaded
the
interview
with
Thomas
Jordan
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
eleven
o'clock
by
St.
Peter
's
Church
.
They
turned
up
a
*NL*
narrow
street
that
led
to
the
Castle
.
It
was
gloomy
and
old-fashioned
,
*NL*
having
low
dark
shops
and
dark
green
house
doors
with
brass
knockers
,
*NL*
and
yellow-ochred
doorsteps
projecting
on
to
the
pavement
;
then
another
*NL*
old
shop
whose
small
window
looked
like
a
cunning
,
half-shut
eye
.
Mother
*NL*
and
son
went
cautiously
,
looking
everywhere
for
``
Thomas
Jordan
and
*NL*
Son
''
.
It
was
like
hunting
in
some
wild
place
.
They
were
on
tiptoe
of
*NL*
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
they
spied
a
big
,
dark
archway
,
in
which
were
names
of
various
*NL*
firms
,
Thomas
Jordan
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
!
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
But
now
WHERE
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
round
.
On
one
side
was
a
queer
,
dark
,
cardboard
factory
,
on
*NL*
the
other
a
Commercial
Hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
up
the
entry
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
ventured
under
the
archway
,
as
into
the
jaws
of
the
dragon
.
*NL*
They
emerged
into
a
wide
yard
,
like
a
well
,
with
buildings
all
round
.
It
*NL*
was
littered
with
straw
and
boxes
,
and
cardboard
.
The
sunshine
actually
*NL*
caught
one
crate
whose
straw
was
streaming
on
to
the
yard
like
gold
.
But
*NL*
elsewhere
the
place
was
like
a
pit
.
There
were
several
doors
,
and
two
*NL*
flights
of
steps
.
Straight
in
front
,
on
a
dirty
glass
door
at
the
top
of
*NL*
a
staircase
,
loomed
the
ominous
words
``
Thomas
Jordan
and
Son
--
Surgical
*NL*
Appliances
.
''
Mrs.
Morel
went
first
,
her
son
followed
her
.
Charles
I
*NL*
mounted
his
scaffold
with
a
lighter
heart
than
had
Paul
Morel
as
he
*NL*
followed
his
mother
up
the
dirty
steps
to
the
dirty
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pushed
open
the
door
,
and
stood
in
pleased
surprise
.
In
front
of
her
*NL*
was
a
big
warehouse
,
with
creamy
paper
parcels
everywhere
,
and
clerks
,
*NL*
with
their
shirt-sleeves
rolled
back
,
were
going
about
in
an
at-home
*NL*
sort
of
way
.
The
light
was
subdued
,
the
glossy
cream
parcels
seemed
*NL*
luminous
,
the
counters
were
of
dark
brown
wood
.
All
was
quiet
and
very
*NL*
homely
.
Mrs.
Morel
took
two
steps
forward
,
then
waited
.
Paul
stood
*NL*
behind
her
.
She
had
on
her
Sunday
bonnet
and
a
black
veil
;
he
wore
a
*NL*
boy
's
broad
white
collar
and
a
Norfolk
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
clerks
looked
up
.
He
was
thin
and
tall
,
with
a
small
face
.
*NL*
His
way
of
looking
was
alert
.
Then
he
glanced
round
to
the
other
end
of
*NL*
the
room
,
where
was
a
glass
office
.
And
then
he
came
forward
.
He
did
*NL*
not
say
anything
,
but
leaned
in
a
gentle
,
inquiring
fashion
towards
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
see
Mr.
Jordan
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
fetch
him
,
''
answered
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
down
to
the
glass
office
.
A
red-faced
,
white-whiskered
old
man
*NL*
looked
up
.
He
reminded
Paul
of
a
pomeranian
dog
.
Then
the
same
little
*NL*
man
came
up
the
room
.
He
had
short
legs
,
was
rather
stout
,
and
wore
*NL*
an
alpaca
jacket
.
So
,
with
one
ear
up
,
as
it
were
,
he
came
stoutly
and
*NL*
inquiringly
down
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morning
!
''
he
said
,
hesitating
before
Mrs.
Morel
,
in
doubt
as
to
*NL*
whether
she
were
a
customer
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morning
.
I
came
with
my
son
,
Paul
Morel
.
You
asked
him
to
call
*NL*
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
this
way
,
''
said
Mr.
Jordan
,
in
a
rather
snappy
little
manner
*NL*
intended
to
be
businesslike
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
followed
the
manufacturer
into
a
grubby
little
room
,
upholstered
*NL*
in
black
American
leather
,
glossy
with
the
rubbing
of
many
customers
.
*NL*
On
the
table
was
a
pile
of
trusses
,
yellow
wash-leather
hoops
tangled
*NL*
together
.
They
looked
new
and
living
.
Paul
sniffed
the
odour
of
new
*NL*
wash-leather
.
He
wondered
what
the
things
were
.
By
this
time
he
was
so
*NL*
much
stunned
that
he
only
noticed
the
outside
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
!
''
said
Mr.
Jordan
,
irritably
pointing
Mrs.
Morel
to
a
*NL*
horse-hair
chair
.
She
sat
on
the
edge
in
an
uncertain
fashion
.
Then
the
*NL*
little
old
man
fidgeted
and
found
a
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
write
this
letter
?
''
he
snapped
,
thrusting
what
Paul
recognised
*NL*
as
his
own
notepaper
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
he
was
occupied
in
two
ways
:
first
,
in
feeling
guilty
*NL*
for
telling
a
lie
,
since
William
had
composed
the
letter
;
second
,
in
*NL*
wondering
why
his
letter
seemed
so
strange
and
different
,
in
the
fat
,
*NL*
red
hand
of
the
man
,
from
what
it
had
been
when
it
lay
on
the
kitchen
*NL*
table
.
It
was
like
part
of
himself
,
gone
astray
.
He
resented
the
way
the
*NL*
man
held
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
learn
to
write
?
''
said
the
old
man
crossly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
merely
looked
at
him
shamedly
,
and
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
IS
a
bad
writer
,
''
put
in
Mrs.
Morel
apologetically
.
Then
she
pushed
*NL*
up
her
veil
.
Paul
hated
her
for
not
being
prouder
with
this
common
*NL*
little
man
,
and
he
loved
her
face
clear
of
the
veil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
say
you
know
French
?
''
inquired
the
little
man
,
still
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
school
did
you
go
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Board-school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
learn
it
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
I
--
''
The
boy
went
crimson
and
got
no
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
godfather
gave
him
lessons
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
half
pleading
and
*NL*
rather
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jordan
hesitated
.
Then
,
in
his
irritable
manner
--
he
always
seemed
to
*NL*
keep
his
hands
ready
for
action
--
he
pulled
another
sheet
of
paper
from
*NL*
his
pocket
,
unfolded
it
.
The
paper
made
a
crackling
noise
.
He
handed
it
*NL*
to
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
that
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
note
in
French
,
in
thin
,
flimsy
foreign
handwriting
that
the
*NL*
boy
could
not
decipher
.
He
stared
blankly
at
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Monsieur
,
'
''
he
began
;
then
he
looked
in
great
confusion
at
Mr.
Jordan
.
*NL*
``
It
's
the
--
it
's
the
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
say
``
handwriting
''
,
but
his
wits
would
no
longer
work
even
*NL*
sufficiently
to
supply
him
with
the
word
.
Feeling
an
utter
fool
,
and
*NL*
hating
Mr.
Jordan
,
he
turned
desperately
to
the
paper
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Sir
,

*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
say
``
handwriting
''
,
but
the
word
still
refused
to
come
.
*NL*
Seeing
him
stuck
,
Mr.
Jordan
snatched
the
paper
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Please
send
by
return
two
pairs
grey
thread
stockings

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
flashed
Paul
,
''
`
doigts
'
means
`
fingers
'
--
as
well
--
as
a
rule
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
man
looked
at
him
.
He
did
not
know
whether
``
doigts
''
meant
*NL*
``
fingers
''
;
he
knew
that
for
all
HIS
purposes
it
meant
``
toes
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fingers
to
stockings
!
''
he
snapped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
DOES
mean
fingers
,
''
the
boy
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hated
the
little
man
,
who
made
such
a
clod
of
him
.
Mr.
Jordan
looked
*NL*
at
the
pale
,
stupid
,
defiant
boy
,
then
at
the
mother
,
who
sat
quiet
and
*NL*
with
that
peculiar
shut-off
look
of
the
poor
who
have
to
depend
on
the
*NL*
favour
of
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
could
he
come
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
as
soon
as
you
wish
.
He
has
finished
school
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
live
in
Bestwood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
he
could
be
in
--
at
the
station
--
at
quarter
to
eight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
ended
by
Paul
's
being
engaged
as
junior
spiral
clerk
at
eight
*NL*
shillings
a
week
.
The
boy
did
not
open
his
mouth
to
say
another
word
,
*NL*
after
having
insisted
that
``
doigts
''
meant
``
fingers
''
.
He
followed
his
*NL*
mother
down
the
stairs
.
She
looked
at
him
with
her
bright
blue
eyes
full
*NL*
of
love
and
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
'll
like
it
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Doigts
'
does
mean
`
fingers
'
,
mother
,
and
it
was
the
writing
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
read
the
writing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
my
boy
.
I
'm
sure
he
'll
be
all
right
,
and
you
wo
n't
see
much
*NL*
of
him
.
Was
n't
that
first
young
fellow
nice
?
I
'm
sure
you
'll
like
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
was
n't
Mr.
Jordan
common
,
mother
?
Does
he
own
it
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
he
was
a
workman
who
has
got
on
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
must
n't
mind
*NL*
people
so
much
.
They
're
not
being
disagreeable
to
YOU
--
it
's
their
way
.
*NL*
You
always
think
people
are
meaning
things
for
you
.
But
they
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
sunny
.
Over
the
big
desolate
space
of
the
market-place
the
*NL*
blue
sky
shimmered
,
and
the
granite
cobbles
of
the
paving
glistened
.
*NL*
Shops
down
the
Long
Row
were
deep
in
obscurity
,
and
the
shadow
was
full
*NL*
of
colour
.
Just
where
the
horse
trams
trundled
across
the
market
was
a
*NL*
row
of
fruit
stalls
,
with
fruit
blazing
in
the
sun
--
apples
and
piles
of
*NL*
reddish
oranges
,
small
green-gage
plums
and
bananas
.
There
was
a
warm
*NL*
scent
of
fruit
as
mother
and
son
passed
.
Gradually
his
feeling
of
*NL*
ignominy
and
of
rage
sank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
should
we
go
for
dinner
?
''
asked
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
felt
to
be
a
reckless
extravagance
.
Paul
had
only
been
in
an
*NL*
eating-house
once
or
twice
in
his
life
,
and
then
only
to
have
a
cup
of
*NL*
tea
and
a
bun
.
Most
of
the
people
of
Bestwood
considered
that
tea
and
*NL*
bread-and-butter
,
and
perhaps
potted
beef
,
was
all
they
could
afford
to
*NL*
eat
in
Nottingham
.
Real
cooked
dinner
was
considered
great
extravagance
.
*NL*
Paul
felt
rather
guilty
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
a
place
that
looked
quite
cheap
.
But
when
Mrs.
Morel
scanned
*NL*
the
bill
of
fare
,
her
heart
was
heavy
,
things
were
so
dear
.
So
she
*NL*
ordered
kidney-pies
and
potatoes
as
the
cheapest
available
dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ought
n't
to
have
come
here
,
mother
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
she
said
.
``
We
wo
n't
come
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
insisted
on
his
having
a
small
currant
tart
,
because
he
liked
*NL*
sweets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
it
,
mother
,
''
he
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
insisted
;
``
you
'll
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
looked
round
for
the
waitress
.
But
the
waitress
was
busy
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
did
not
like
to
bother
her
then
.
So
the
mother
and
son
waited
*NL*
for
the
girl
's
pleasure
,
whilst
she
flirted
among
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brazen
hussy
!
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
to
Paul
.
``
Look
now
,
she
's
taking
that
*NL*
man
HIS
pudding
,
and
he
came
long
after
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
matter
,
mother
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
was
angry
.
But
she
was
too
poor
,
and
her
orders
were
too
*NL*
meagre
,
so
that
she
had
not
the
courage
to
insist
on
her
rights
just
*NL*
then
.
They
waited
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
we
go
,
mother
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mrs.
Morel
stood
up
.
The
girl
was
passing
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
bring
one
currant
tart
?
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
clearly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
looked
round
insolently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Directly
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
waited
quite
long
enough
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
the
girl
came
back
with
the
tart
.
Mrs.
Morel
asked
coldly
*NL*
for
the
bill
.
Paul
wanted
to
sink
through
the
floor
.
He
marvelled
at
his
*NL*
mother
's
hardness
.
He
knew
that
only
years
of
battling
had
taught
her
to
*NL*
insist
even
so
little
on
her
rights
.
She
shrank
as
much
as
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
last
time
I
go
THERE
for
anything
!
''
she
declared
,
when
they
*NL*
were
outside
the
place
,
thankful
to
be
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
go
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
look
at
Keep
's
and
Boot
's
,
and
one
or
two
*NL*
places
,
shall
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
discussions
over
the
pictures
,
and
Mrs.
Morel
wanted
to
buy
*NL*
him
a
little
sable
brush
that
he
hankered
after
.
But
this
indulgence
he
*NL*
refused
.
He
stood
in
front
of
milliners
'
shops
and
drapers
'
shops
almost
*NL*
bored
,
but
content
for
her
to
be
interested
.
They
wandered
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
just
look
at
those
black
grapes
!
''
she
said
.
``
They
make
your
mouth
*NL*
water
.
I
've
wanted
some
of
those
for
years
,
but
I
s
'll
have
to
wait
a
*NL*
bit
before
I
get
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
rejoiced
in
the
florists
,
standing
in
the
doorway
sniffing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
oh
!
Is
n't
it
simply
lovely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
saw
,
in
the
darkness
of
the
shop
,
an
elegant
young
lady
in
black
*NL*
peering
over
the
counter
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
looking
at
you
,
''
he
said
,
trying
to
draw
his
mother
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
it
?
''
she
exclaimed
,
refusing
to
be
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stocks
!
''
he
answered
,
sniffing
hastily
.
``
Look
,
there
's
a
tubful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
there
is
--
red
and
white
.
But
really
,
I
never
knew
stocks
to
smell
*NL*
like
it
!
''
And
,
to
his
great
relief
,
she
moved
out
of
the
doorway
,
but
*NL*
only
to
stand
in
front
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
!
''
she
cried
to
him
,
who
was
trying
to
get
out
of
sight
of
the
*NL*
elegant
young
lady
in
black
--
the
shop-girl
.
``
Paul
!
Just
look
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
reluctantly
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
just
look
at
that
fuchsia
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
pointing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
He
made
a
curious
,
interested
sound
.
``
You
'd
think
every
second
as
*NL*
the
flowers
was
going
to
fall
off
,
they
hang
so
big
an
'
heavy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
such
an
abundance
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
way
they
drop
downwards
with
their
threads
and
knots
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Lovely
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
who
'll
buy
it
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
!
''
she
answered
.
``
Not
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
die
in
our
parlour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
beastly
cold
,
sunless
hole
;
it
kills
every
bit
of
a
plant
you
put
*NL*
in
,
and
the
kitchen
chokes
them
to
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
bought
a
few
things
,
and
set
off
towards
the
station
.
Looking
up
*NL*
the
canal
,
through
the
dark
pass
of
the
buildings
,
they
saw
the
Castle
*NL*
on
its
bluff
of
brown
,
green-bushed
rock
,
in
a
positive
miracle
of
*NL*
delicate
sunshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
it
be
nice
for
me
to
come
out
at
dinner-times
?
''
said
Paul
.
``
I
can
*NL*
go
all
round
here
and
see
everything
.
I
s
'll
love
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
,
''
assented
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
spent
a
perfect
afternoon
with
his
mother
.
They
arrived
home
in
*NL*
the
mellow
evening
,
happy
,
and
glowing
,
and
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
he
filled
in
the
form
for
his
season-ticket
and
took
it
*NL*
to
the
station
.
When
he
got
back
,
his
mother
was
just
beginning
to
wash
*NL*
the
floor
.
He
sat
crouched
up
on
the
sofa
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
it
'll
be
here
on
Saturday
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
will
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
one
pound
eleven
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
washing
her
floor
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
lot
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
more
than
I
thought
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
I
s
'll
earn
eight
shillings
a
week
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
,
but
went
on
with
her
work
.
At
last
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
William
promised
me
,
when
he
went
to
London
,
as
he
'd
give
me
a

pound
a
month

He
has
given

ten
shillings

twice
;
and
now
I
know
*NL*
he
has
n't
a
farthing
if
I
asked
him

Not
that
I
want
it

Only
just
now

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
earns

said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
earns
a

thirty

it

precious
little

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
spends
over
fifty

Paul
.

*NL*
``
And
I
keep
this
house
on

than
thirty

she
replied
;

am

supposed

find
money

extras

But
they
do

care
about

once
they

gone

He

rather
spend
it
on

creature

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

Paul

*NL*

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
William
was
succeeding
with
his
``
Gipsy
''
,
as
he
called
her
.
He
asked
the
*NL*
girl
--
her
name
was
Louisa
Lily
Denys
Western
--
for
a
photograph
to
send
*NL*
to
his
mother
.
The
photo
came
--
a
handsome
brunette
,
taken
in
profile
,
*NL*
smirking
slightly
--
and
,
it
might
be
,
quite
naked
,
for
on
the
photograph
*NL*
not
a
scrap
of
clothing
was
to
be
seen
,
only
a
naked
bust
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
wrote
Mrs.
Morel
to
her
son
,
``
the
photograph
of
Louie
is
very
*NL*
striking

I
can
see

do
you

my

boy

it
was
very
good
taste
of
a

give
her

that
photo

to
send
to

the
first

Certainly
the
shoulders
are
beautiful

*NL*
*NL*
Morel
found
the
photograph
standing
on
the
chiffonier
in
the
parlour

He
*NL*
came
out
with
it
between
his
thick
thumb
and
finger

*NL*
*NL*
``

to
send
you
another
,
that
I
hope
*NL*
will
please
you
better
.
She
's
always
being
photographed
;
in
fact
,
the
*NL*
photographers
ask
her
if
they
may
take
her
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
new
photograph
came
,
with
a
little
silly
note
from
the
*NL*
girl
.
This
time
the
young
lady
was
seen
in
a
black
satin
evening
bodice
,
*NL*
cut
square
,
with
little
puff
sleeves
,
and
black
lace
hanging
down
her
*NL*
beautiful
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
she
ever
wears
anything
except
evening
clothes
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
sarcastically
.
``
I
'm
sure
I
ought
to
be
impressed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
disagreeable
,
mother
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
I
think
the
first
one
with
*NL*
bare
shoulders
is
lovely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
''
answered
his
mother
.
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Monday
morning
the
boy
got
up
at
six
to
start
work
.
He
had
the
*NL*
season-ticket
,
which
had
cost
such
bitterness
,
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
.
*NL*
He
loved
it
with
its
bars
of
yellow
across
.
His
mother
packed
his
dinner
*NL*
in
a
small
,
shut-up
basket
,
and
he
set
off
at
a
quarter
to
seven
to
*NL*
catch
the
7.15
train
.
Mrs.
Morel
came
to
the
entry-end
to
see
him
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
perfect
morning
.
From
the
ash
tree
the
slender
green
fruits
*NL*
that
the
children
call
``
pigeons
''
were
twinkling
gaily
down
on
a
little
*NL*
breeze
,
into
the
front
gardens
of
the
houses
.
The
valley
was
full
of
a
*NL*
lustrous
dark
haze
,
through
which
the
ripe
corn
shimmered
,
and
in
which
*NL*
the
steam
from
Minton
pit
melted
swiftly
.
Puffs
of
wind
came
.
Paul
*NL*
looked
over
the
high
woods
of
Aldersley
,
where
the
country
gleamed
,
and
*NL*
home
had
never
pulled
at
him
so
powerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morning
,
mother
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
,
but
feeling
very
unhappy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morning
,
''
she
replied
cheerfully
and
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
in
her
white
apron
on
the
open
road
,
watching
him
as
he
*NL*
crossed
the
field
.
He
had
a
small
,
compact
body
that
looked
full
of
*NL*
life
.
She
felt
,
as
she
saw
him
trudging
over
the
field
,
that
where
he
*NL*
determined
to
go
he
would
get
.
She
thought
of
William
.
He
would
have
*NL*
leaped
the
fence
instead
of
going
round
the
stile
.
He
was
away
in
*NL*
London
,
doing
well
.
Paul
would
be
working
in
Nottingham
.
Now
she
had
*NL*
two
sons
in
the
world
.
She
could
think
of
two
places
,
great
centres
of
*NL*
industry
,
and
feel
that
she
had
put
a
man
into
each
of
them
,
that
these
*NL*
men
would
work
out
what
SHE
wanted
;
they
were
derived
from
her
,
they
*NL*
were
of
her
,
and
their
works
also
would
be
hers
.
All
the
morning
long
*NL*
she
thought
of
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eight
o'clock
he
climbed
the
dismal
stairs
of
Jordan
's
Surgical
*NL*
Appliance
Factory
,
and
stood
helplessly
against
the
first
great
*NL*
parcel-rack
,
waiting
for
somebody
to
pick
him
up
.
The
place
was
still
*NL*
not
awake
.
Over
the
counters
were
great
dust
sheets
.
Two
men
only
had
*NL*
arrived
,
and
were
heard
talking
in
a
corner
,
as
they
took
off
their
*NL*
coats
and
rolled
up
their
shirt-sleeves
.
It
was
ten
past
eight
.
*NL*
Evidently
there
was
no
rush
of
punctuality
.
Paul
listened
to
the
voices
*NL*
of
the
two
clerks
.
Then
he
heard
someone
cough
,
and
saw
in
the
office
*NL*
at
the
end
of
the
room
an
old
,
decaying
clerk
,
in
a
round
smoking-cap
of
*NL*
black
velvet
embroidered
with
red
and
green
,
opening
letters
.
He
waited
*NL*
and
waited
.
One
of
the
junior
clerks
went
to
the
old
man
,
greeted
him
*NL*
cheerily
and
loudly
.
Evidently
the
old
``
chief
''
was
deaf
.
Then
the
young
*NL*
fellow
came
striding
importantly
down
to
his
counter
.
He
spied
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
he
said
.
``
You
the
new
lad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
What
's
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
Morel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
Morel
?
All
right
,
you
come
on
round
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
followed
him
round
the
rectangle
of
counters
.
The
room
was
second
*NL*
storey
.
It
had
a
great
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
,
fenced
as
with
a
*NL*
wall
of
counters
,
and
down
this
wide
shaft
the
lifts
went
,
and
the
light
*NL*
for
the
bottom
storey
.
Also
there
was
a
corresponding
big
,
oblong
hole
*NL*
in
the
ceiling
,
and
one
could
see
above
,
over
the
fence
of
the
top
*NL*
floor
,
some
machinery
;
and
right
away
overhead
was
the
glass
roof
,
and
*NL*
all
light
for
the
three
storeys
came
downwards
,
getting
dimmer
,
so
that
*NL*
it
was
always
night
on
the
ground
floor
and
rather
gloomy
on
the
second
*NL*
floor
.
The
factory
was
the
top
floor
,
the
warehouse
the
second
,
the
*NL*
storehouse
the
ground
floor
.
It
was
an
insanitary
,
ancient
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
led
round
to
a
very
dark
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
`
Spiral
'
corner
,
''
said
the
clerk
.
``
You
're
Spiral
,
with
*NL*
Pappleworth
.
He
's
your
boss
,
but
he
's
not
come
yet
.
He
does
n't
get
here
*NL*
till
half-past
eight
.
So
you
can
fetch
the
letters
,
if
you
like
,
from
*NL*
Mr.
Melling
down
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
pointed
to
the
old
clerk
in
the
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
peg
to
hang
your
cap
on
.
Here
are
your
entry
ledgers
.
Mr.
*NL*
Pappleworth
wo
n't
be
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
thin
young
man
stalked
away
with
long
,
busy
strides
over
the
*NL*
hollow
wooden
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
minute
or
two
Paul
went
down
and
stood
in
the
door
of
the
glass
*NL*
office
.
The
old
clerk
in
the
smoking-cap
looked
down
over
the
rim
of
his
*NL*
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-morning
,
''
he
said
,
kindly
and
impressively
.
``
You
want
the
letters
*NL*
for
the
Spiral
department
,
Thomas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
resented
being
called
``
Thomas
''
.
But
he
took
the
letters
and
*NL*
returned
to
his
dark
place
,
where
the
counter
made
an
angle
,
where
the
*NL*
great
parcel-rack
came
to
an
end
,
and
where
there
were
three
doors
in
*NL*
the
corner
.
He
sat
on
a
high
stool
and
read
the
letters
--
those
whose
*NL*
handwriting
was
not
too
difficult
.
They
ran
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
please
send
me
at
once
a
pair
of
lady
's
silk
spiral
*NL*
thigh-hose
,
without
feet
,
such
as
I
had
from
you
last
year
;
length
,
*NL*
thigh
to
knee
,
etc.
''
Or
,
``
Major
Chamberlain
wishes
to
repeat
his
*NL*
previous
order
for
a
silk
non-elastic
suspensory
bandage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Many
of
these
letters
,
some
of
them
in
French
or
Norwegian
,
were
a
great
*NL*
puzzle
to
the
boy
.
He
sat
on
his
stool
nervously
awaiting
the
arrival
*NL*
of
his
``
boss
''
.
He
suffered
tortures
of
shyness
when
,
at
half-past
eight
,
*NL*
the
factory
girls
for
upstairs
trooped
past
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pappleworth
arrived
,
chewing
a
chlorodyne
gum
,
at
about
twenty
to
*NL*
nine
,
when
all
the
other
men
were
at
work
.
He
was
a
thin
,
sallow
man
*NL*
with
a
red
nose
,
quick
,
staccato
,
and
smartly
but
stiffly
dressed
.
He
*NL*
was
about
thirty-six
years
old
.
There
was
something
rather
``
doggy
''
,
*NL*
rather
smart
,
rather
`
cute
and
shrewd
,
and
something
warm
,
and
something
*NL*
slightly
contemptible
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
my
new
lad
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
stood
up
and
said
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetched
the
letters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pappleworth
gave
a
chew
to
his
gum
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Copied
'em
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
come
on
then
,
let
's
look
slippy
.
Changed
your
coat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
bring
an
old
coat
and
leave
it
here
.
''
He
pronounced
the
*NL*
last
words
with
the
chlorodyne
gum
between
his
side
teeth
.
He
vanished
*NL*
into
the
darkness
behind
the
great
parcel-rack
,
reappeared
coatless
,
*NL*
turning
up
a
smart
striped
shirt-cuff
over
a
thin
and
hairy
arm
.
Then
*NL*
he
slipped
into
his
coat
.
Paul
noticed
how
thin
he
was
,
and
that
his
*NL*
trousers
were
in
folds
behind
.
He
seized
a
stool
,
dragged
it
beside
the
*NL*
boy
's
,
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
took
a
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pappleworth
was
very
close
to
him
.
The
man
seized
the
letters
,
*NL*
snatched
a
long
entry-book
out
of
a
rack
in
front
of
him
,
flung
it
open
,
*NL*
seized
a
pen
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
look
here
.
You
want
to
copy
these
letters
in
here
.
''
He
sniffed
*NL*
twice
,
gave
a
quick
chew
at
his
gum
,
stared
fixedly
at
a
letter
,
*NL*
then
went
very
still
and
absorbed
,
and
wrote
the
entry
rapidly
,
in
a
*NL*
beautiful
flourishing
hand
.
He
glanced
quickly
at
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
you
can
do
it
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
then
,
let
's
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprang
off
his
stool
.
Paul
took
a
pen
.
Mr.
Pappleworth
disappeared
.
*NL*
Paul
rather
liked
copying
the
letters
,
but
he
wrote
slowly
,
laboriously
,
*NL*
and
exceedingly
badly
.
He
was
doing
the
fourth
letter
,
and
feeling
quite
*NL*
busy
and
happy
,
when
Mr.
Pappleworth
reappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
how
`
r
'
yer
getting
on
?
Done
'em
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
over
the
boy
's
shoulder
,
chewing
,
and
smelling
of
chlorodyne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strike
my
bob
,
lad
,
but
you
're
a
beautiful
writer
!
''
he
exclaimed
*NL*
satirically
.
``
Ne'er
mind
,
how
many
h
`
yer
done
?
Only
three
!
I
'd
'
a
eaten
*NL*
'em
.
Get
on
,
my
lad
,
an
'
put
numbers
on
'em
.
Here
,
look
!
Get
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
ground
away
at
the
letters
,
whilst
Mr.
Pappleworth
fussed
over
*NL*
various
jobs
.
Suddenly
the
boy
started
as
a
shrill
whistle
sounded
near
*NL*
his
ear
.
Mr.
Pappleworth
came
,
took
a
plug
out
of
a
pipe
,
and
said
,
in
*NL*
an
amazingly
cross
and
bossy
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
heard
a
faint
voice
,
like
a
woman
's
,
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
tube
.
*NL*
He
gazed
in
wonder
,
never
having
seen
a
speaking-tube
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Mr.
Pappleworth
disagreeably
into
the
tube
,
``
you
'd
better
*NL*
get
some
of
your
back
work
done
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
the
woman
's
tiny
voice
was
heard
,
sounding
pretty
and
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
not
time
to
stand
here
while
you
talk
,
''
said
Mr.
Pappleworth
,
and
*NL*
he
pushed
the
plug
into
the
tube
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
lad
,
''
he
said
imploringly
to
Paul
,
``
there
's
Polly
crying
out
*NL*
for
them
orders
.
Ca
n't
you
buck
up
a
bit
?
Here
,
come
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
book
,
to
Paul
's
immense
chagrin
,
and
began
the
copying
*NL*
himself
.
He
worked
quickly
and
well
.
This
done
,
he
seized
some
strips
*NL*
of
long
yellow
paper
,
about
three
inches
wide
,
and
made
out
the
day
's
*NL*
orders
for
the
work-girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
watch
me
,
''
he
said
to
Paul
,
working
all
the
while
rapidly
.
*NL*
Paul
watched
the
weird
little
drawings
of
legs
,
and
thighs
,
and
ankles
,
*NL*
with
the
strokes
across
and
the
numbers
,
and
the
few
brief
directions
*NL*
which
his
chief
made
upon
the
yellow
paper
.
Then
Mr.
Pappleworth
*NL*
finished
and
jumped
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
with
me
,
''
he
said
,
and
the
yellow
papers
flying
in
his
hands
,
*NL*
he
dashed
through
a
door
and
down
some
stairs
,
into
the
basement
where
*NL*
the
gas
was
burning
.
They
crossed
the
cold
,
damp
storeroom
,
then
a
*NL*
long
,
dreary
room
with
a
long
table
on
trestles
,
into
a
smaller
,
cosy
*NL*
apartment
,
not
very
high
,
which
had
been
built
on
to
the
main
building
.
*NL*
In
this
room
a
small
woman
with
a
red
serge
blouse
,
and
her
black
hair
*NL*
done
on
top
of
her
head
,
was
waiting
like
a
proud
little
bantam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
y'
are
!
''
said
Pappleworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
is
`
here
you
are
'
!
''
exclaimed
Polly
.
``
The
girls
have
been
*NL*
here
nearly
half
an
hour
waiting
.
Just
think
of
the
time
wasted
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
YOU
think
of
getting
your
work
done
and
not
talking
so
much
,
''
said
Mr.
*NL*
Pappleworth
.
``
You
could
ha

been
finishing
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
quite
well
we
finished
everything
off
on
Saturday
!
''
cried
*NL*
Pony
,
flying
at
him
,
her
dark
eyes
flashing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tu-tu-tu-tu-terterter
!
''
he
mocked
.
``
Here
's
your
new
lad
.
Do
n't
ruin
him
*NL*
as
you
did
the
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
we
did
the
last
!
''
repeated
Polly
.
``
Yes
,
WE
do
a
lot
of
ruining
,
we
*NL*
do
.
My
word
,
a
lad
would
TAKE
some
ruining
after
he
'd
been
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
time
for
work
now
,
not
for
talk
,
''
said
Mr.
Pappleworth
severely
*NL*
and
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
time
for
work
some
time
back
,
''
said
Polly
,
marching
away
with
*NL*
her
head
in
the
air
.
She
was
an
erect
little
body
of
forty
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
room
were
two
round
spiral
machines
on
the
bench
under
the
*NL*
window
.
Through
the
inner
doorway
was
another
longer
room
,
with
six
more
*NL*
machines
.
A
little
group
of
girls
,
nicely
dressed
in
white
aprons
,
stood
*NL*
talking
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
nothing
else
to
do
but
talk
?
''
said
Mr.
Pappleworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
wait
for
you
,
''
said
one
handsome
girl
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
get
on
,
get
on
,
''
he
said
.
``
Come
on
,
my
lad
.
You
'll
know
your
road
*NL*
down
here
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Paul
ran
upstairs
after
his
chief
.
He
was
given
some
checking
*NL*
and
invoicing
to
do
.
He
stood
at
the
desk
,
labouring
in
his
execrable
*NL*
handwriting
.
Presently
Mr.
Jordan
came
strutting
down
from
the
glass
*NL*
office
and
stood
behind
him
,
to
the
boy
's
great
discomfort
.
Suddenly
a
*NL*
red
and
fat
finger
was
thrust
on
the
form
he
was
filling
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
MR.
J.
A.
Bates
,
Esquire
!
''
exclaimed
the
cross
voice
just
behind
his
*NL*
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
looked
at
``
Mr.
J.
A.
Bates
,
Esquire
''
in
his
own
vile
writing
,
and
*NL*
wondered
what
was
the
matter
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
they
teach
you
any
better
THAN
that
while
they
were
at
it
?
If
*NL*
you
put
`
Mr.
'
you
do
n't
put
Esquire
'
-
a
man
ca
n't
be
both
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
regretted
his
too-much
generosity
in
disposing
of
honours
,
*NL*
hesitated
,
and
with
trembling
fingers
,
scratched
out
the
``
Mr.
''
Then
all
*NL*
at
once
Mr.
Jordan
snatched
away
the
invoice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
another
!
Are
you
going
to
send
that
to
a
gentleman
?
''
And
he
tore
*NL*
up
the
blue
form
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
,
his
ears
red
with
shame
,
began
again
.
Still
Mr.
Jordan
watched
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
they
DO
teach
in
schools
.
You
'll
have
to
write
better
*NL*
than
that
.
Lads
learn
nothing
nowadays
,
but
how
to
recite
poetry
*NL*
and
play
the
fiddle
.
Have
you
seen
his
writing
?
''
he
asked
of
Mr.
*NL*
Pappleworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
prime
,
is
n't
it
?
''
replied
Mr.
Pappleworth
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jordan
gave
a
little
grunt
,
not
unamiable
.
Paul
divined
that
his
*NL*
master
's
bark
was
worse
than
his
bite
.
Indeed
,
the
little
manufacturer
,
*NL*
although
he
spoke
bad
English
,
was
quite
gentleman
enough
to
leave
his
*NL*
men
alone
and
to
take
no
notice
of
trifles
.
But
he
knew
he
did
not
*NL*
look
like
the
boss
and
owner
of
the
show
,
so
he
had
to
play
his
role
of
*NL*
proprietor
at
first
,
to
put
things
on
a
right
footing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
see
,
WHAT
'S
your
name
?
''
asked
Mr.
Pappleworth
of
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
Morel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
curious
that
children
suffer
so
much
at
having
to
pronounce
their
*NL*
own
names
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
Morel
,
is
it
?
All
right
,
you
Paul-Morel
through
them
things
there
,
*NL*
and
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Pappleworth
subsided
on
to
a
stool
,
and
began
writing
.
A
girl
came
*NL*
up
from
out
of
a
door
just
behind
,
put
some
newly-pressed
elastic
web
*NL*
appliances
on
the
counter
,
and
returned
.
Mr.
Pappleworth
picked
up
the
*NL*
whitey-blue
knee-band
,
examined
it
,
and
its
yellow
order-paper
quickly
,
*NL*
and
put
it
on
one
side
.
Next
was
a
flesh-pink
``
leg
''
.
He
went
through
*NL*
the
few
things
,
wrote
out
a
couple
of
orders
,
and
called
to
Paul
to
*NL*
accompany
him
.
This
time
they
went
through
the
door
whence
the
girl
had
*NL*
emerged
.
There
Paul
found
himself
at
the
top
of
a
little
wooden
flight
*NL*
of
steps
,
and
below
him
saw
a
room
with
windows
round
two
sides
,
and
at
*NL*
the
farther
end
half
a
dozen
girls
sitting
bending
over
the
benches
*NL*
in
the
light
from
the
window
,
sewing
.
They
were
singing
together
``
Two
*NL*
Little
Girls
in
Blue
''
.
Hearing
the
door
opened
,
they
all
turned
round
,
*NL*
to
see
Mr.
Pappleworth
and
Paul
looking
down
on
them
from
the
far
end
of
*NL*
the
room
.
They
stopped
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
make
a
bit
less
row
?
''
said
Mr.
Pappleworth
.
``
Folk
'll
think
we
*NL*
keep
cats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
hunchback
woman
on
a
high
stool
turned
her
long
,
rather
heavy
face
*NL*
towards
Mr.
Pappleworth
,
and
said
,
in
a
contralto
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
all
tom-cats
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
Mr.
Pappleworth
tried
to
be
impressive
for
Paul
's
benefit
.
*NL*
He
descended
the
steps
into
the
finishing-off
room
,
and
went
to
the
*NL*
hunchback
Fanny
.
She
had
such
a
short
body
on
her
high
stool
that
her
*NL*
head
,
with
its
great
bands
of
bright
brown
hair
,
seemed
over
large
,
as
*NL*
did
her
pale
,
heavy
face
.
She
wore
a
dress
of
green-black
cashmere
,
and
*NL*
her
wrists
,
coming
out
of
the
narrow
cuffs
,
were
thin
and
flat
,
as
she
*NL*
put
down
her
work
nervously
.
He
showed
her
something
that
was
wrong
with
*NL*
a
knee-cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
need
n't
come
blaming
it
on
to
me
.
It
's
not
my
*NL*
fault
.
''
Her
colour
mounted
to
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
said
it
WAS
your
fault
.
Will
you
do
as
I
tell
you
?
''
replied
Mr.
*NL*
Pappleworth
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say
it
's
my
fault
,
but
you
'd
like
to
make
out
as
it
was
,
''
the
*NL*
hunchback
woman
cried
,
almost
in
tears
.
Then
she
snatched
the
knee-cap
*NL*
from
her
``
boss
''
,
saying
:
``
Yes
,
I
'll
do
it
for
you
,
but
you
need
n't
be
*NL*
snappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
your
new
lad
,
''
said
Mr.
Pappleworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
turned
,
smiling
very
gently
on
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
do
n't
make
a
softy
of
him
between
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
us
as
`
ud
make
a
softy
of
him
,
''
she
said
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
then
,
Paul
,
''
said
Mr.
Pappleworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Au
revoy
,
Paul
,
''
said
one
of
the
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
titter
of
laughter
.
Paul
went
out
,
blushing
deeply
,
not
*NL*
having
spoken
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
was
very
long
.
All
morning
the
work-people
were
coming
to
speak
*NL*
to
Mr.
Pappleworth
.
Paul
was
writing
or
learning
to
make
up
parcels
,
*NL*
ready
for
the
midday
post
.
At
one
o'clock
,
or
,
rather
,
at
a
quarter
to
*NL*
one
,
Mr.
Pappleworth
disappeared
to
catch
his
train
:
he
lived
in
the
*NL*
suburbs
.
At
one
o'clock
,
Paul
,
feeling
very
lost
,
took
his
dinner-basket
*NL*
down
into
the
stockroom
in
the
basement
,
that
had
the
long
table
on
*NL*
trestles
,
and
ate
his
meal
hurriedly
,
alone
in
that
cellar
of
gloom
and
*NL*
desolation
.
Then
he
went
out
of
doors
.
The
brightness
and
the
freedom
of
*NL*
the
streets
made
him
feel
adventurous
and
happy
.
But
at
two
o'clock
*NL*
he
was
back
in
the
corner
of
the
big
room
.
Soon
the
work-girls
went
*NL*
trooping
past
,
making
remarks
.
It
was
the
commoner
girls
who
worked
*NL*
upstairs
at
the
heavy
tasks
of
truss-making
and
the
finishing
of
*NL*
artificial
limbs
.
He
waited
for
Mr.
Pappleworth
,
not
knowing
what
to
do
,
*NL*
sitting
scribbling
on
the
yellow
order-paper
.
Mr.
Pappleworth
came
at
*NL*
twenty
minutes
to
three
.
Then
he
sat
and
gossiped
with
Paul
,
treating
*NL*
the
boy
entirely
as
an
equal
,
even
in
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
there
was
never
very
much
to
do
,
unless
it
were
near
*NL*
the
week-end
,
and
the
accounts
had
to
be
made
up
.
At
five
o'clock
all
*NL*
the
men
went
down
into
the
dungeon
with
the
table
on
trestles
,
and
there
*NL*
they
had
tea
,
eating
bread-and-butter
on
the
bare
,
dirty
boards
,
talking
*NL*
with
the
same
kind
of
ugly
haste
and
slovenliness
with
which
they
ate
*NL*
their
meal
.
And
yet
upstairs
the
atmosphere
among
them
was
always
jolly
*NL*
and
clear
.
The
cellar
and
the
trestles
affected
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
,
when
all
the
gases
were
lighted
,
WORK
went
more
briskly
.
*NL*
There
was
the
big
evening
post
to
get
off
.
The
hose
came
up
warm
and
*NL*
newly
pressed
from
the
workrooms
.
Paul
had
made
out
the
invoices
.
Now
he
*NL*
had
the
packing
up
and
addressing
to
do
,
then
he
had
to
weigh
his
stock
*NL*
of
parcels
on
the
scales
.
Everywhere
voices
were
calling
weights
,
there
*NL*
was
the
chink
of
metal
,
the
rapid
snapping
of
string
,
the
hurrying
to
*NL*
old
Mr.
Melling
for
stamps
.
And
at
last
the
postman
came
with
his
sack
,
*NL*
laughing
and
jolly
.
Then
everything
slacked
off
,
and
Paul
took
his
*NL*
dinner-basket
and
ran
to
the
station
to
catch
the
eight-twenty
train
.
*NL*
The
day
in
the
factory
was
just
twelve
hours
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
sat
waiting
for
him
rather
anxiously
.
He
had
to
walk
from
*NL*
Keston
,
so
was
not
home
until
about
twenty
past
nine
.
And
he
left
the
*NL*
house
before
seven
in
the
morning
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
rather
anxious
about
*NL*
his
health
.
But
she
herself
had
had
to
put
up
with
so
much
that
she
*NL*
expected
her
children
to
take
the
same
odds
.
They
must
go
through
with
*NL*
what
came
.
And
Paul
stayed
at
Jordan
's
,
although
all
the
time
he
was
*NL*
there
his
health
suffered
from
the
darkness
and
lack
of
air
and
the
long
*NL*
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
in
pale
and
tired
.
His
mother
looked
at
him
.
She
saw
he
was
*NL*
rather
pleased
,
and
her
anxiety
all
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
was
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ever
so
funny
,
mother
,
''
he
replied
.
``
You
do
n't
have
to
work
a
bit
hard
,
*NL*
and
they
're
nice
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
get
on
all
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
they
only
say
my
writing
's
bad
.
But
Mr.
Pappleworth
--
he
's
my
*NL*
man
--
said
to
Mr.
Jordan
I
should
be
all
right
.
I
'm
Spiral
,
mother
;
you
*NL*
must
come
and
see
.
It
's
ever
so
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
he
liked
Jordan
's
.
Mr.
Pappleworth
,
who
had
a
certain
``
saloon
bar
''
*NL*
flavour
about
him
,
was
always
natural
,
and
treated
him
as
if
he
had
been
*NL*
a
comrade
.
Sometimes
the
``
Spiral
boss
''
was
irritable
,
and
chewed
more
*NL*
lozenges
than
ever
.
Even
then
,
however
,
he
was
not
offensive
,
but
one
*NL*
of
those
people
who
hurt
themselves
by
their
own
irritability
more
than
*NL*
they
hurt
other
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
done
that
YET
?
''
he
would
cry
.
``
Go
on
,
be
a
month
of
*NL*
Sundays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
and
Paul
could
understand
him
least
then
,
he
was
jocular
and
in
*NL*
high
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
bring
my
little
Yorkshire
terrier
bitch
tomorrow
,
''
he
said
*NL*
jubilantly
to
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a
Yorkshire
terrier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
DO
N'T
know
what
a
Yorkshire
terrier
is
?
DO
N'T
KNOW
A
YORKSHIRE
--
''
Mr.
*NL*
Pappleworth
was
aghast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
little
silky
one
--
colours
of
iron
and
rusty
silver
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
THAT
'S
it
,
my
lad
.
She
's
a
gem
.
She
's
had
five
pounds
'
worth
of
pups
*NL*
already
,
and
she
's
worth
over
seven
pounds
herself
;
and
she
does
n't
*NL*
weigh
twenty
ounces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
the
bitch
came
.
She
was
a
shivering
,
miserable
morsel
.
Paul
*NL*
did
not
care
for
her
;
she
seemed
so
like
a
wet
rag
that
would
never
*NL*
dry
.
Then
a
man
called
for
her
,
and
began
to
make
coarse
jokes
.
But
Mr.
*NL*
Pappleworth
nodded
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
boy
,
and
the
talk
*NL*
went
on
_
sotto
voce
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jordan
only
made
one
more
excursion
to
watch
Paul
,
and
then
the
only
*NL*
fault
he
found
was
seeing
the
boy
lay
his
pen
on
the
counter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
your
pen
in
your
ear
,
if
you
're
going
to
be
a
clerk
.
Pen
in
your
*NL*
ear
!
''
And
one
day
he
said
to
the
lad
:
``
Why
do
n't
you
hold
your
shoulders
*NL*
straighter
?
Come
down
here
,
''
when
he
took
him
into
the
glass
office
and
*NL*
fitted
him
with
special
braces
for
keeping
the
shoulders
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Paul
liked
the
girls
best
.
The
men
seemed
common
and
rather
dull
.
*NL*
He
liked
them
all
,
but
they
were
uninteresting
.
Polly
,
the
little
brisk
*NL*
overseer
downstairs
,
finding
Paul
eating
in
the
cellar
,
asked
him
if
she
*NL*
could
cook
him
anything
on
her
little
stove
.
Next
day
his
mother
gave
*NL*
him
a
dish
that
could
be
heated
up
.
He
took
it
into
the
pleasant
,
clean
*NL*
room
to
Polly
.
And
very
soon
it
grew
to
be
an
established
custom
that
he
*NL*
should
have
dinner
with
her
.
When
he
came
in
at
eight
in
the
morning
he
*NL*
took
his
basket
to
her
,
and
when
he
came
down
at
one
o'clock
she
had
his
*NL*
dinner
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
very
tall
,
and
pale
,
with
thick
chestnut
hair
,
irregular
*NL*
features
,
and
a
wide
,
full
mouth
.
She
was
like
a
small
bird
.
He
often
*NL*
called
her
a
``
robinet
''
.
Though
naturally
rather
quiet
,
he
would
sit
and
*NL*
chatter
with
her
for
hours
telling
her
about
his
home
.
The
girls
all
*NL*
liked
to
hear
him
talk
.
They
often
gathered
in
a
little
circle
while
he
*NL*
sat
on
a
bench
,
and
held
forth
to
them
,
laughing
.
Some
of
them
regarded
*NL*
him
as
a
curious
little
creature
,
so
serious
,
yet
so
bright
and
jolly
,
*NL*
and
always
so
delicate
in
his
way
with
them
.
They
all
liked
him
,
and
he
*NL*
adored
them
.
Polly
he
felt
he
belonged
to
.
Then
Connie
,
with
her
mane
of
*NL*
red
hair
,
her
face
of
apple-blossom
,
her
murmuring
voice
,
such
a
lady
in
*NL*
her
shabby
black
frock
,
appealed
to
his
romantic
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
sit
winding
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
looks
as
if
you
were
spinning
at
*NL*
a
spinning-wheel
--
it
looks
ever
so
nice
.
You
remind
me
of
Elaine
in
the
*NL*
`
Idylls
of
the
King
'
.
I
'd
draw
you
if
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
glanced
at
him
blushing
shyly
.
And
later
on
he
had
a
sketch
*NL*
he
prized
very
much
:
Connie
sitting
on
the
stool
before
the
wheel
,
her
*NL*
flowing
mane
of
red
hair
on
her
rusty
black
frock
,
her
red
mouth
shut
*NL*
and
serious
,
running
the
scarlet
thread
off
the
hank
on
to
the
reel
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Louie
,
handsome
and
brazen
,
who
always
seemed
to
thrust
her
hip
at
*NL*
him
,
he
usually
joked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Emma
was
rather
plain
,
rather
old
,
and
condescending
.
But
to
condescend
*NL*
to
him
made
her
happy
,
and
he
did
not
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
put
needles
in
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
and
do
n't
bother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ought
to
know
how
to
put
needles
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
ground
at
her
machine
all
the
while
steadily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
many
things
you
ought
to
know
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
then
,
how
to
stick
needles
in
the
machine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
boy
,
what
a
nuisance
he
is
!
Why
,
THIS
is
how
you
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
her
attentively
.
Suddenly
a
whistle
piped
.
Then
Polly
*NL*
appeared
,
and
said
in
a
clear
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Pappleworth
wants
to
know
how
much
longer
you
're
going
to
be
down
*NL*
here
playing
with
the
girls
,
Paul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
flew
upstairs
,
calling
``
Good-bye
!
''
and
Emma
drew
herself
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
ME
who
wanted
him
to
play
with
the
machine
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
rule
,
when
all
the
girls
came
back
at
two
o'clock
,
he
ran
upstairs
*NL*
to
Fanny
,
the
hunchback
,
in
the
finishing-off
room
.
Mr.
Pappleworth
*NL*
did
not
appear
till
twenty
to
three
,
and
he
often
found
his
boy
sitting
*NL*
beside
Fanny
,
talking
,
or
drawing
,
or
singing
with
the
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
after
a
minute
's
hesitation
,
Fanny
would
begin
to
sing
.
She
had
a
*NL*
fine
contralto
voice
.
Everybody
joined
in
the
chorus
,
and
it
went
well
.
*NL*
Paul
was
not
at
all
embarrassed
,
after
a
while
,
sitting
in
the
room
with
*NL*
the
half
a
dozen
work-girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
song
Fanny
would
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
've
been
laughing
at
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
so
soft
,
Fanny
!
''
cried
one
of
the
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
there
was
mention
of
Connie
's
red
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
's
is
better
,
to
my
fancy
,
''
said
Emma
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
try
to
make
a
fool
of
me
,
''
said
Fanny
,
flushing
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
she
has
,
Paul
;
she
's
got
beautiful
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
treat
of
a
colour
,
''
said
he
.
``
That
coldish
colour
like
earth
,
*NL*
and
yet
shiny
.
It
's
like
bog-water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
me
!
''
exclaimed
one
girl
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
do
but
get
criticised
,
''
said
Fanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
should
see
it
down
,
Paul
,
''
cried
Emma
earnestly
.
``
It
's
simply
*NL*
beautiful
.
Put
it
down
for
him
,
Fanny
,
if
he
wants
something
to
paint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
would
not
,
and
yet
she
wanted
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
take
it
down
myself
,
''
said
the
lad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
if
you
like
,
''
said
Fanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
carefully
took
the
pins
out
of
the
knot
,
and
the
rush
of
hair
,
of
*NL*
uniform
dark
brown
,
slid
over
the
humped
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
lovely
lot
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
watched
.
There
was
silence
.
The
youth
shook
the
hair
loose
*NL*
from
the
coil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
splendid
!
''
he
said
,
smelling
its
perfume
.
``
I
'll
bet
it
's
worth
*NL*
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
leave
it
you
when
I
die
,
Paul
,
''
said
Fanny
,
half
joking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
just
like
anybody
else
,
sitting
drying
their
hair
,
''
said
one
*NL*
of
the
girls
to
the
long-legged
hunchback
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Fanny
was
morbidly
sensitive
,
always
imagining
insults
.
Polly
was
*NL*
curt
and
businesslike
.
The
two
departments
were
for
ever
at
war
,
and
*NL*
Paul
was
always
finding
Fanny
in
tears
.
Then
he
was
made
the
recipient
*NL*
of
all
her
woes
,
and
he
had
to
plead
her
case
with
Polly
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
time
went
along
happily
enough
.
The
factory
had
a
homely
feel
.
*NL*
No
one
was
rushed
or
driven
.
Paul
always
enjoyed
it
when
the
work
got
*NL*
faster
,
towards
post-time
,
and
all
the
men
united
in
labour
.
He
liked
to
*NL*
watch
his
fellow-clerks
at
work
.
The
man
was
the
work
and
the
work
was
*NL*
the
man
,
one
thing
,
for
the
time
being
.
It
was
different
with
the
girls
.
*NL*
The
real
woman
never
seemed
to
be
there
at
the
task
,
but
as
if
left
out
,
*NL*
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
train
going
home
at
night
he
used
to
watch
the
lights
of
the
*NL*
town
,
sprinkled
thick
on
the
hills
,
fusing
together
in
a
blaze
in
the
*NL*
valleys
.
He
felt
rich
in
life
and
happy
.
Drawing
farther
off
,
there
was
*NL*
a
patch
of
lights
at
Bulwell
like
myriad
petals
shaken
to
the
ground
*NL*
from
the
shed
stars
;
and
beyond
was
the
red
glare
of
the
furnaces
,
*NL*
playing
like
hot
breath
on
the
clouds
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
walk
two
and
more
miles
from
Keston
home
,
up
two
long
hills
,
*NL*
down
two
short
hills
.
He
was
often
tired
,
and
he
counted
the
lamps
*NL*
climbing
the
hill
above
him
,
how
many
more
to
pass
.
And
from
the
*NL*
hilltop
,
on
pitch-dark
nights
,
he
looked
round
on
the
villages
five
*NL*
or
six
miles
away
,
that
shone
like
swarms
of
glittering
living
things
,
*NL*
almost
a
heaven
against
his
feet
.
Marlpool
and
Heanor
scattered
the
*NL*
far-off
darkness
with
brilliance
.
And
occasionally
the
black
valley
*NL*
space
between
was
traced
,
violated
by
a
great
train
rushing
south
to
*NL*
London
or
north
to
Scotland
.
The
trains
roared
by
like
projectiles
level
*NL*
on
the
darkness
,
fuming
and
burning
,
making
the
valley
clang
with
*NL*
their
passage
.
They
were
gone
,
and
the
lights
of
the
towns
and
villages
*NL*
glittered
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
came
to
the
corner
at
home
,
which
faced
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
night
.
The
ash-tree
seemed
a
friend
now
.
His
mother
rose
with
*NL*
gladness
as
he
entered
.
He
put
his
eight
shillings
proudly
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
help
,
mother
?
''
he
asked
wistfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
precious
little
left
,
''
she
answered
,
``
after
your
ticket
and
*NL*
dinners
and
such
are
taken
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
told
her
the
budget
of
the
day
.
His
life-story
,
like
an
Arabian
*NL*
Nights
,
was
told
night
after
night
to
his
mother
.
It
was
almost
as
if
it
*NL*
were
her
own
life
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
DEATH
IN
THE
FAMILY
*NL*
*NL*
ARTHUR
MOREL
was
growing
up
.
He
was
a
quick
,
careless
,
impulsive
boy
,
a
*NL*
good
deal
like
his
father
.
He
hated
study
,
made
a
great
moan
if
he
had
*NL*
to
work
,
and
escaped
as
soon
as
possible
to
his
sport
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
appearance
he
remained
the
flower
of
the
family
,
being
well
made
,
*NL*
graceful
,
and
full
of
life
.
His
dark
brown
hair
and
fresh
colouring
,
and
*NL*
his
exquisite
dark
blue
eyes
shaded
with
long
lashes
,
together
with
his
*NL*
generous
manner
and
fiery
temper
,
made
him
a
favourite
.
But
as
he
grew
*NL*
older
his
temper
became
uncertain
.
He
flew
into
rages
over
nothing
,
*NL*
seemed
unbearably
raw
and
irritable
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
,
whom
he
loved
,
wearied
of
him
sometimes
.
He
thought
only
of
*NL*
himself
.
When
he
wanted
amusement
,
all
that
stood
in
his
way
he
*NL*
hated
,
even
if
it
were
she
.
When
he
was
in
trouble
he
moaned
to
her
*NL*
ceaselessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
,
boy
!
''
she
said
,
when
he
groaned
about
a
master
who
,
he
said
,
*NL*
hated
him
,
``
if
you
do
n't
like
it
,
alter
it
,
and
if
you
ca
n't
alter
it
,
*NL*
put
up
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
his
father
,
whom
he
had
loved
and
who
had
worshipped
him
,
he
came
*NL*
to
detest
.
As
he
grew
older
Morel
fell
into
a
slow
ruin
.
His
body
,
which
*NL*
had
been
beautiful
in
movement
and
in
being
,
shrank
,
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
ripen
with
the
years
,
but
to
get
mean
and
rather
despicable
.
There
came
*NL*
over
him
a
look
of
meanness
and
of
paltriness
.
And
when
the
mean-looking
*NL*
elderly
man
bullied
or
ordered
the
boy
about
,
Arthur
was
furious
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
Morel
's
manners
got
worse
and
worse
,
his
habits
somewhat
*NL*
disgusting
.
When
the
children
were
growing
up
and
in
the
crucial
stage
*NL*
of
adolescence
,
the
father
was
like
some
ugly
irritant
to
their
souls
.
*NL*
His
manners
in
the
house
were
the
same
as
he
used
among
the
colliers
*NL*
down
pit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dirty
nuisance
!
''
Arthur
would
cry
,
jumping
up
and
going
straight
out
*NL*
of
the
house
when
his
father
disgusted
him
.
And
Morel
persisted
the
more
*NL*
because
his
children
hated
it
.
He
seemed
to
take
a
kind
of
satisfaction
*NL*
in
disgusting
them
,
and
driving
them
nearly
mad
,
while
they
were
so
*NL*
irritably
sensitive
at
the
age
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
.
So
that
Arthur
,
*NL*
who
was
growing
up
when
his
father
was
degenerate
and
elderly
,
hated
him
*NL*
worst
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
sometimes
,
the
father
would
seem
to
feel
the
contemptuous
hatred
*NL*
of
his
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
not
a
man
tries
harder
for
his
family
!
''
he
would
shout
.
``
He
*NL*
does
his
best
for
them
,
and
then
gets
treated
like
a
dog
.
But
I
'm
not
*NL*
going
to
stand
it
,
I
tell
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
the
threat
and
the
fact
that
he
did
not
try
so
hard
as
he
*NL*
imagined
,
they
would
have
felt
sorry
.
As
it
was
,
the
battle
now
went
on
*NL*
nearly
all
between
father
and
children
,
he
persisting
in
his
dirty
and
*NL*
disgusting
ways
,
just
to
assert
his
independence
.
They
loathed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Arthur
was
so
inflamed
and
irritable
at
last
,
that
when
he
won
a
*NL*
scholarship
for
the
Grammar
School
in
Nottingham
,
his
mother
decided
*NL*
to
let
him
live
in
town
,
with
one
of
her
sisters
,
and
only
come
home
at
*NL*
week-ends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
was
still
a
junior
teacher
in
the
Board-school
,
earning
about
four
*NL*
shillings
a
week
.
But
soon
she
would
have
fifteen
shillings
,
since
she
*NL*
had
passed
her
examination
,
and
there
would
be
financial
peace
in
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
clung
now
to
Paul
.
He
was
quiet
and
not
brilliant
.
But
still
*NL*
he
stuck
to
his
painting
,
and
still
he
stuck
to
his
mother
.
Everything
*NL*
he
did
was
for
her
.
She
waited
for
his
coming
home
in
the
evening
,
and
*NL*
then
she
unburdened
herself
of
all
she
had
pondered
,
or
of
all
that
*NL*
had
occurred
to
her
during
the
day
.
He
sat
and
listened
with
his
*NL*
earnestness
.
The
two
shared
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
was
engaged
now
to
his
brunette
,
and
had
bought
her
an
*NL*
engagement
ring
that
cost
eight
guineas
.
The
children
gasped
at
such
a
*NL*
fabulous
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
guineas
!
''
said
Morel
.
``
More
fool
him
!
If
he
'd
gen
me
some
o
n't
,
*NL*
it
`
ud
ha
'
looked
better
on
`
im
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Given
YOU
some
of
it
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
Why
give
YOU
some
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
remembered
HE
had
bought
no
engagement
ring
at
all
,
and
she
*NL*
preferred
William
,
who
was
not
mean
,
if
he
were
foolish
.
But
now
the
*NL*
young
man
talked
only
of
the
dances
to
which
he
went
with
his
betrothed
,
*NL*
and
the
different
resplendent
clothes
she
wore
;
or
he
told
his
mother
*NL*
with
glee
how
they
went
to
the
theatre
like
great
swells
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
bring
the
girl
home
.
Mrs.
Morel
said
she
should
come
at
the
*NL*
Christmas
.
This
time
William
arrived
with
a
lady
,
but
with
no
presents
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
had
prepared
supper
.
Hearing
footsteps
,
she
rose
and
went
to
*NL*
the
door
.
William
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
mother
!
''
He
kissed
her
hastily
,
then
stood
aside
to
present
a
*NL*
tall
,
handsome
girl
,
who
was
wearing
a
costume
of
fine
black-and-white
*NL*
check
,
and
furs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
Gyp
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Western
held
out
her
hand
and
showed
her
teeth
in
a
small
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Morel
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
you
will
be
hungry
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
we
had
dinner
in
the
train
.
Have
you
got
my
gloves
,
Chubby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
William
Morel
,
big
and
raw-boned
,
looked
at
her
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
've
lost
them
.
Do
n't
be
cross
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
frown
went
over
his
face
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
She
glanced
round
*NL*
the
kitchen
.
It
was
small
and
curious
to
her
,
with
its
glittering
*NL*
kissing-bunch
,
its
evergreens
behind
the
pictures
,
its
wooden
chairs
and
*NL*
little
deal
table
.
At
that
moment
Morel
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
dad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
my
son
!
Tha
's
let
on
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
shook
hands
,
and
William
presented
the
lady
.
She
gave
the
same
*NL*
smile
that
showed
her
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
,
Mr.
Morel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
bowed
obsequiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
well
,
and
I
hope
so
are
you
.
You
must
make
yourself
very
*NL*
welcome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
,
''
she
replied
,
rather
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
like
to
go
upstairs
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
mind
;
but
not
if
it
is
any
trouble
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
no
trouble
.
Annie
will
take
you
.
Walter
,
carry
up
this
box
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
be
an
hour
dressing
yourself
up
,
''
said
William
to
his
*NL*
betrothed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
took
a
brass
candlestick
,
and
,
too
shy
almost
to
speak
,
preceded
*NL*
the
young
lady
to
the
front
bedroom
,
which
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Morel
had
*NL*
vacated
for
her
.
It
,
too
,
was
small
and
cold
by
candlelight
.
The
*NL*
colliers
'
wives
only
lit
fires
in
bedrooms
in
case
of
extreme
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
unstrap
the
box
?
''
asked
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
very
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
played
the
part
of
maid
,
then
went
downstairs
for
hot
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
's
rather
tired
,
mother
,
''
said
William
.
``
It
's
a
beastly
*NL*
journey
,
and
we
had
such
a
rush
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
I
can
give
her
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
she
'll
be
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
a
chill
in
the
atmosphere
.
After
half
an
hour
Miss
Western
*NL*
came
down
,
having
put
on
a
purplish-coloured
dress
,
very
fine
for
the
*NL*
collier
's
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
you
'd
no
need
to
change
,
''
said
William
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Chubby
!
''
Then
she
turned
with
that
sweetish
smile
to
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
he
's
always
grumbling
,
Mrs.
Morel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
?
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
That
's
not
very
nice
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
,
really
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
cold
,
''
said
the
mother
.
``
Wo
n't
you
come
near
the
fire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
jumped
out
of
his
armchair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
sit
you
here
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Come
and
sit
you
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dad
,
keep
your
own
chair
.
Sit
on
the
sofa
,
Gyp
,
''
said
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
!
''
cried
Morel
.
``
This
cheer
's
warmest
.
Come
and
sit
here
,
Miss
*NL*
Wesson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
so
much
,
''
said
the
girl
,
seating
herself
in
the
collier
's
*NL*
armchair
,
the
place
of
honour
.
She
shivered
,
feeling
the
warmth
of
the
*NL*
kitchen
penetrate
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetch
me
a
hanky
,
Chubby
dear
!
''
she
said
,
putting
up
her
mouth
to
him
,
*NL*
and
using
the
same
intimate
tone
as
if
they
were
alone
;
which
made
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
family
feel
as
if
they
ought
not
to
be
present
.
The
young
*NL*
lady
evidently
did
not
realise
them
as
people
:
they
were
creatures
to
*NL*
her
for
the
present
.
William
winced
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
such
a
household
,
in
Streatham
,
Miss
Western
would
have
been
a
lady
*NL*
condescending
to
her
inferiors
.
These
people
were
to
her
,
certainly
*NL*
clownish
--
in
short
,
the
working
classes
.
How
was
she
to
adjust
herself
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
,
''
said
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Western
took
no
notice
,
as
if
a
servant
had
spoken
.
But
when
the
*NL*
girl
came
downstairs
again
with
the
handkerchief
,
she
said
:
``
Oh
,
thank
*NL*
you
!
''
in
a
gracious
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
and
talked
about
the
dinner
on
the
train
,
which
had
been
so
*NL*
poor
;
about
London
,
about
dances
.
She
was
really
very
nervous
,
and
*NL*
chattered
from
fear
.
Morel
sat
all
the
time
smoking
his
thick
twist
*NL*
tobacco
,
watching
her
,
and
listening
to
her
glib
London
speech
,
as
he
*NL*
puffed
.
Mrs.
Morel
,
dressed
up
in
her
best
black
silk
blouse
,
answered
*NL*
quietly
and
rather
briefly
.
The
three
children
sat
round
in
silence
and
*NL*
admiration
.
Miss
Western
was
the
princess
.
Everything
of
the
best
was
*NL*
got
out
for
her
:
the
best
cups
,
the
best
spoons
,
the
best
table
cloth
,
*NL*
the
best
coffee-jug
.
The
children
thought
she
must
find
it
quite
grand
.
*NL*
She
felt
strange
,
not
able
to
realise
the
people
,
not
knowing
how
to
*NL*
treat
them
.
William
joked
,
and
was
slightly
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
ten
o'clock
he
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
tired
,
Gyp
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
,
Chubby
,
''
she
answered
,
at
once
in
the
intimate
tones
and
*NL*
putting
her
head
slightly
on
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
light
her
the
candle
,
mother
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
replied
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Western
stood
up
,
held
out
her
hand
to
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
Mrs.
Morel
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
sat
at
the
boiler
,
letting
the
water
run
from
the
tap
into
a
stone
*NL*
beer-bottle
.
Annie
swathed
the
bottle
in
an
old
flannel
pit-singlet
,
and
*NL*
kissed
her
mother
good-night
.
She
was
to
share
the
room
with
the
lady
,
*NL*
because
the
house
was
full
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wait
a
minute
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
to
Annie
.
And
Annie
sat
nursing
*NL*
the
hot-water
bottle
.
Miss
Western
shook
hands
all
round
,
to
everybody
's
*NL*
discomfort
,
and
took
her
departure
,
preceded
by
William
.
In
five
minutes
*NL*
he
was
downstairs
again
.
His
heart
was
rather
sore
;
he
did
not
know
why
.
*NL*
He
talked
very
little
till
everybody
had
gone
to
bed
,
but
himself
and
*NL*
his
mother
.
Then
he
stood
with
his
legs
apart
,
in
his
old
attitude
on
*NL*
the
hearthrug
,
and
said
hesitatingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
son
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
in
the
rocking-chair
,
feeling
somehow
hurt
and
humiliated
,
for
*NL*
his
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
came
the
slow
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
shy
yet
,
mother
.
She
's
not
used
to
it
.
It
's
different
from
her
*NL*
aunt
's
house
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
is
,
my
boy
;
and
she
must
find
it
difficult
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
.
''
Then
he
frowned
swiftly
.
``
If
only
she
would
n't
put
on
her
*NL*
BLESSED
airs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
her
first
awkwardness
,
my
boy
.
She
'll
be
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
mother
,
''
he
replied
gratefully
.
But
his
brow
was
gloomy
.
*NL*
``
You
know
,
she
's
not
like
you
,
mother
.
She
's
not
serious
,
and
she
ca
n't
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
young
,
my
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
she
's
had
no
sort
of
show
.
Her
mother
died
when
she
was
a
*NL*
child
.
Since
then
she
's
lived
with
her
aunt
,
whom
she
ca
n't
bear
.
And
*NL*
her
father
was
a
rake
.
She
's
had
no
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
Well
,
you
must
make
up
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
--
you
have
to
forgive
her
a
lot
of
things

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
WHAT
do
you
have
to
forgive
her
,
my
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dunno
.
When
she
seems
shallow
,
you
have
to
remember
she
's
never
had
*NL*
anybody
to
bring
her
deeper
side
out
.
And
she
's
FEARFULLY
fond
of
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anybody
can
see
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
know
,
mother
--
she
's
--
she
's
different
from
us

Those
sort
of
*NL*
people
,
like
those
she
lives
amongst
,
they
do
n't
seem
to
have
the
same
*NL*
principles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
n't
judge
too
hastily
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
seemed
uneasy
within
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
however
,
he
was
up
singing
and
larking
round
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
he
called
,
sitting
on
the
stairs
.
``
Are
you
getting
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
her
voice
called
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merry
Christmas
!
''
he
shouted
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
laugh
,
pretty
and
tinkling
,
was
heard
in
the
bedroom
.
She
did
not
*NL*
come
down
in
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
she
REALLY
getting
up
when
she
said
she
was
?
''
he
asked
of
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
was
,
''
replied
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
a
while
,
then
went
to
the
stairs
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
New
Year
,
''
he
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Chubby
dear
!
''
came
the
laughing
voice
,
far
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Buck
up
!
''
he
implored
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
an
hour
,
and
still
he
was
waiting
for
her
.
Morel
,
who
*NL*
always
rose
before
six
,
looked
at
the
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
a
winder
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
had
breakfasted
,
all
but
William
.
He
went
to
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
have
to
send
you
an
Easter
egg
up
there
?
''
he
called
,
rather
*NL*
crossly
.
She
only
laughed
.
The
family
expected
,
after
that
time
of
*NL*
preparation
,
something
like
magic
.
At
last
she
came
,
looking
very
nice
*NL*
in
a
blouse
and
skirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
REALLY
been
all
this
time
getting
ready
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chubby
dear
!
That
question
is
not
permitted
,
is
it
,
Mrs.
Morel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
played
the
grand
lady
at
first
.
When
she
went
with
William
*NL*
to
chapel
,
he
in
his
frock-coat
and
silk
hat
,
she
in
her
furs
and
*NL*
London-made
costume
,
Paul
and
Arthur
and
Annie
expected
everybody
to
bow
*NL*
to
the
ground
in
admiration
.
And
Morel
,
standing
in
his
Sunday
suit
*NL*
at
the
end
of
the
road
,
watching
the
gallant
pair
go
,
felt
he
was
the
*NL*
father
of
princes
and
princesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
she
was
not
so
grand
.
For
a
year
now
she
had
been
a
sort
of
*NL*
secretary
or
clerk
in
a
London
office
.
But
while
she
was
with
the
Morels
*NL*
she
queened
it
.
She
sat
and
let
Annie
or
Paul
wait
on
her
as
if
they
*NL*
were
her
servants
.
She
treated
Mrs.
Morel
with
a
certain
glibness
and
*NL*
Morel
with
patronage
.
But
after
a
day
or
so
she
began
to
change
her
*NL*
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
always
wanted
Paul
or
Annie
to
go
along
with
them
on
their
*NL*
walks
.
It
was
so
much
more
interesting
.
And
Paul
really
DID
admire
*NL*
``
Gipsy
''
wholeheartedly
;
in
fact
,
his
mother
scarcely
forgave
the
boy
for
*NL*
the
adulation
with
which
he
treated
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
second
day
,
when
Lily
said
:
``
Oh
,
Annie
,
do
you
know
where
I
left
*NL*
my
muff
?
''
William
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
it
is
in
your
bedroom
.
Why
do
you
ask
Annie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Lily
went
upstairs
with
a
cross
,
shut
mouth
.
But
it
angered
the
*NL*
young
man
that
she
made
a
servant
of
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
third
evening
William
and
Lily
were
sitting
together
in
the
*NL*
parlour
by
the
fire
in
the
dark
.
At
a
quarter
to
eleven
Mrs.
Morel
was
*NL*
heard
raking
the
fire
.
William
came
out
to
the
kitchen
,
followed
by
his
*NL*
beloved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
as
late
as
that
,
mother
?
''
he
said
.
She
had
been
sitting
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
LATE
,
my
boy
,
but
it
is
as
late
as
I
usually
sit
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
go
to
bed
,
then
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
leave
you
two
?
No
,
my
boy
,
I
do
n't
believe
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
trust
us
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
I
can
or
not
,
I
wo
n't
do
it
.
You
can
stay
till
eleven
if
you
*NL*
like
,
and
I
can
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
bed
,
Gyp
,
''
he
said
to
his
girl
.
``
We
wo
n't
keep
mater
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
has
left
the
candle
burning
,
Lily
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
;
``
I
think
you
*NL*
will
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
thank
you
.
Good-night
,
Mrs.
Morel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
William
kissed
his
sweetheart
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
,
and
she
went
.
*NL*
He
returned
to
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
trust
us
,
mother
?
''
he
repeated
,
rather
offended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
boy
,
I
tell
you
I
do
n't
BELIEVE
in
leaving
two
young
things
like
you
*NL*
alone
downstairs
when
everyone
else
is
in
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
was
forced
to
take
this
answer
.
He
kissed
his
mother
good-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Easter
he
came
over
alone
.
And
then
he
discussed
his
sweetheart
*NL*
endlessly
with
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
mother
,
when
I
'm
away
from
her
I
do
n't
care
for
her
a
bit
.
I
*NL*
should
n't
care
if
I
never
saw
her
again
.
But
,
then
,
when
I
'm
with
her
in
*NL*
the
evenings
I
am
awfully
fond
of
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
queer
sort
of
love
to
marry
on
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
if
she
holds
*NL*
you
no
more
than
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
IS
funny
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
It
worried
and
perplexed
him
.
``
But
*NL*
yet
--
there
's
so
much
between
us
now
I
could
n't
give
her
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
best
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
But
if
it
is
as
you
say
,
I
would
n't
*NL*
call
it
LOVE
--
at
any
rate
,
it
does
n't
look
much
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
mother
.
She
's
an
orphan
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
never
came
to
any
sort
of
conclusion
.
He
seemed
puzzled
and
rather
*NL*
fretted
.
She
was
rather
reserved
.
All
his
strength
and
money
went
*NL*
in
keeping
this
girl
.
He
could
scarcely
afford
to
take
his
mother
to
*NL*
Nottingham
when
he
came
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
's
wages
had
been
raised
at
Christmas
to
ten
shillings
,
to
his
great
*NL*
joy
.
He
was
quite
happy
at
Jordan
's
,
but
his
health
suffered
from
the
*NL*
long
hours
and
the
confinement
.
His
mother
,
to
whom
he
became
more
and
*NL*
more
significant
,
thought
how
to
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
half-day
holiday
was
on
Monday
afternoon
.
On
a
Monday
morning
in
*NL*
May
,
as
the
two
sat
alone
at
breakfast
,
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
will
be
a
fine
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
in
surprise
.
This
meant
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
Mr.
Leivers
has
gone
to
live
on
a
new
farm
.
Well
,
he
asked
me
*NL*
last
week
if
I
would
n't
go
and
see
Mrs.
Leivers
,
and
I
promised
to
bring
*NL*
you
on
Monday
if
it
's
fine
.
Shall
we
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
little
woman
,
how
lovely
!
''
he
cried
.
``
And
we
'll
go
this
*NL*
afternoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
hurried
off
to
the
station
jubilant
.
Down
Derby
Road
was
a
*NL*
cherry-tree
that
glistened
.
The
old
brick
wall
by
the
Statutes
ground
*NL*
burned
scarlet
,
spring
was
a
very
flame
of
green
.
And
the
steep
swoop
*NL*
of
highroad
lay
,
in
its
cool
morning
dust
,
splendid
with
patterns
of
*NL*
sunshine
and
shadow
,
perfectly
still
.
The
trees
sloped
their
great
green
*NL*
shoulders
proudly
;
and
inside
the
warehouse
all
the
morning
,
the
boy
had
*NL*
a
vision
of
spring
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
home
at
dinner-time
his
mother
was
rather
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
going
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
'm
ready
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
he
got
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
get
dressed
while
I
wash
up
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
so
.
He
washed
the
pots
,
straightened
,
and
then
took
her
boots
.
*NL*
They
were
quite
clean
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
one
of
those
naturally
exquisite
*NL*
people
who
can
walk
in
mud
without
dirtying
their
shoes
.
But
Paul
had
to
*NL*
clean
them
for
her
.
They
were
kid
boots
at
eight
shillings
a
pair
.
He
,
*NL*
however
,
thought
them
the
most
dainty
boots
in
the
world
,
and
he
cleaned
*NL*
them
with
as
much
reverence
as
if
they
had
been
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
appeared
in
the
inner
doorway
rather
shyly
.
She
had
got
a
*NL*
new
cotton
blouse
on
.
Paul
jumped
up
and
went
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
stars
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
What
a
bobby-dazzler
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sniffed
in
a
little
haughty
way
,
and
put
her
head
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
bobby-dazzler
at
all
!
''
she
replied
.
``
It
's
very
quiet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
forward
,
whilst
he
hovered
round
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
asked
,
quite
shy
,
but
pretending
to
be
high
and
mighty
,
``
do
*NL*
you
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Awfully
!
You
ARE
a
fine
little
woman
to
go
jaunting
out
with
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
and
surveyed
her
from
the
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
I
was
walking
down
the
street
behind
you
,
I
should
*NL*
say
:
`
Does
n't
THAT
little
person
fancy
herself
!
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
does
n't
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
She
's
not
sure
it
suits
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
she
wants
to
be
in
dirty
black
,
looking
as
if
she
was
wrapped
in
*NL*
burnt
paper
.
It
DOES
suit
you
,
and
I
say
you
look
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sniffed
in
her
little
way
,
pleased
,
but
pretending
to
know
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
``
it
's
cost
me
just
three
shillings
.
You
could
n't
have
*NL*
got
it
ready-made
for
that
price
,
could
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
you
could
n't
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
you
know
,
it
's
good
stuff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Awfully
pretty
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blouse
was
white
,
with
a
little
sprig
of
heliotrope
and
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
young
for
me
,
though
,
I
'm
afraid
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
young
for
you
!
''
he
exclaimed
in
disgust
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
buy
some
*NL*
false
white
hair
and
stick
it
on
your
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
soon
have
no
need
,
''
she
replied
.
``
I
'm
going
white
fast
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
've
no
business
to
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
do
I
want
with
a
*NL*
white-haired
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
you
'll
have
to
put
up
with
one
,
my
lad
,
''
she
said
rather
*NL*
strangely
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
set
off
in
great
style
,
she
carrying
the
umbrella
William
had
given
*NL*
her
,
because
of
the
sun
.
Paul
was
considerably
taller
than
she
,
though
*NL*
he
was
not
big
.
He
fancied
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
fallow
land
the
young
wheat
shone
silkily
.
Minton
pit
waved
its
*NL*
plumes
of
white
steam
,
coughed
,
and
rattled
hoarsely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
look
at
that
!
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
Mother
and
son
stood
on
the
road
to
*NL*
watch
.
Along
the
ridge
of
the
great
pit-hill
crawled
a
little
group
*NL*
in
silhouette
against
the
sky
,
a
horse
,
a
small
truck
,
and
a
man
.
They
*NL*
climbed
the
incline
against
the
heavens
.
At
the
end
the
man
tipped
the
*NL*
wagon
.
There
was
an
undue
rattle
as
the
waste
fell
down
the
sheer
slope
*NL*
of
the
enormous
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sit
a
minute
,
mother
,
''
he
said
,
and
she
took
a
seat
on
a
bank
,
*NL*
whilst
he
sketched
rapidly
.
She
was
silent
whilst
he
worked
,
looking
*NL*
round
at
the
afternoon
,
the
red
cottages
shining
among
their
greenness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
world
is
a
wonderful
place
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
wonderfully
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
's
the
pit
,
''
he
said
.
``
Look
how
it
heaps
together
,
like
something
*NL*
alive
almost
--
a
big
creature
that
you
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
.
``
Perhaps
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
all
the
trucks
standing
waiting
,
like
a
string
of
beasts
to
be
*NL*
fed
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
very
thankful
I
am
they
ARE
standing
,
''
she
said
,
``
for
that
means
*NL*
they
'll
turn
middling
time
this
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
like
the
feel
of
MEN
on
things
,
while
they
're
alive
.
There
's
a
*NL*
feel
of
men
about
trucks
,
because
they
've
been
handled
with
men
's
hands
,
*NL*
all
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
along
under
the
trees
of
the
highroad
.
He
was
constantly
*NL*
informing
her
,
but
she
was
interested
.
They
passed
the
end
of
*NL*
Nethermere
,
that
was
tossing
its
sunshine
like
petals
lightly
in
*NL*
its
lap
.
Then
they
turned
on
a
private
road
,
and
in
some
trepidation
*NL*
approached
a
big
farm
.
A
dog
barked
furiously
.
A
woman
came
out
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
the
way
to
Willey
Farm
?
''
Mrs.
Morel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
hung
behind
in
terror
of
being
sent
back
.
But
the
woman
was
*NL*
amiable
,
and
directed
them
.
The
mother
and
son
went
through
the
wheat
*NL*
and
oats
,
over
a
little
bridge
into
a
wild
meadow
.
Peewits
,
with
their
*NL*
white
breasts
glistening
,
wheeled
and
screamed
about
them
.
The
lake
was
*NL*
still
and
blue
.
High
overhead
a
heron
floated
.
Opposite
,
the
wood
heaped
*NL*
on
the
hill
,
green
and
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
wild
road
,
mother
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
Just
like
Canada
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
beautiful
!
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
looking
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
that
heron
--
see
--
see
her
legs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
directed
his
mother
,
what
she
must
see
and
what
not
.
And
she
was
*NL*
quite
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
now
,
''
she
said
,
``
which
way
?
He
told
me
through
the
wood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wood
,
fenced
and
dark
,
lay
on
their
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
feel
a
bit
of
a
path
this
road
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
You
've
got
town
*NL*
feet
,
somehow
or
other
,
you
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
a
little
gate
,
and
soon
were
in
a
broad
green
alley
of
the
*NL*
wood
,
with
a
new
thicket
of
fir
and
pine
on
one
hand
,
an
old
oak
glade
*NL*
dipping
down
on
the
other
.
And
among
the
oaks
the
bluebells
stood
in
*NL*
pools
of
azure
,
under
the
new
green
hazels
,
upon
a
pale
fawn
floor
of
*NL*
oak-leaves
.
He
found
flowers
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
bit
of
new-mown
hay
,
''
he
said
;
then
,
again
,
he
brought
her
*NL*
forget-me-nots
.
And
,
again
,
his
heart
hurt
with
love
,
seeing
her
hand
,
*NL*
used
with
work
,
holding
the
little
bunch
of
flowers
he
gave
her
.
She
was
*NL*
perfectly
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
the
end
of
the
riding
was
a
fence
to
climb
.
Paul
was
over
in
a
*NL*
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
he
said
,
``
let
me
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
go
away
.
I
will
do
it
in
my
own
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
below
with
his
hands
up
ready
to
help
her
.
She
climbed
*NL*
cautiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
way
to
climb
!
''
he
exclaimed
scornfully
,
when
she
was
safely
to
*NL*
earth
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hateful
stiles
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Duffer
of
a
little
woman
,
''
he
replied
,
``
who
ca
n't
get
over
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
front
,
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
was
a
cluster
of
low
red
farm
*NL*
buildings
.
The
two
hastened
forward
.
Flush
with
the
wood
was
the
apple
*NL*
orchard
,
where
blossom
was
falling
on
the
grindstone
.
The
pond
was
deep
*NL*
under
a
hedge
and
overhanging
oak
trees
.
Some
cows
stood
in
the
shade
.
*NL*
The
farm
and
buildings
,
three
sides
of
a
quadrangle
,
embraced
the
*NL*
sunshine
towards
the
wood
.
It
was
very
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
and
son
went
into
the
small
railed
garden
,
where
was
a
scent
*NL*
of
red
gillivers
.
By
the
open
door
were
some
floury
loaves
,
put
out
to
*NL*
cool
.
A
hen
was
just
coming
to
peck
them
.
Then
,
in
the
doorway
suddenly
*NL*
appeared
a
girl
in
a
dirty
apron
.
She
was
about
fourteen
years
old
,
had
*NL*
a
rosy
dark
face
,
a
bunch
of
short
black
curls
,
very
fine
and
free
,
and
*NL*
dark
eyes
;
shy
,
questioning
,
a
little
resentful
of
the
strangers
,
she
*NL*
disappeared
.
In
a
minute
another
figure
appeared
,
a
small
,
frail
woman
,
*NL*
rosy
,
with
great
dark
brown
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
smiling
with
a
little
glow
,
``
you
've
come
,
then
.
I
*NL*
AM
glad
to
see
you
.
''
Her
voice
was
intimate
and
rather
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
women
shook
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
are
you
sure
we
're
not
a
bother
to
you
?
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
I
know
*NL*
what
a
farming
life
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
We
're
only
too
thankful
to
see
a
new
face
,
it
's
so
lost
up
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
taken
through
into
the
parlour
--
a
long
,
low
room
,
with
a
great
*NL*
bunch
of
guelder-roses
in
the
fireplace
.
There
the
women
talked
,
whilst
*NL*
Paul
went
out
to
survey
the
land
.
He
was
in
the
garden
smelling
the
*NL*
gillivers
and
looking
at
the
plants
,
when
the
girl
came
out
quickly
to
*NL*
the
heap
of
coal
which
stood
by
the
fence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
these
are
cabbage-roses
?
''
he
said
to
her
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
bushes
along
the
fence
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
with
startled
,
big
brown
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
they
are
cabbage-roses
when
they
come
out
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
faltered
.
``
They
're
white
with
pink
middles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
're
maiden-blush
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
flushed
.
She
had
a
beautiful
warm
colouring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
have
MUCH
in
your
garden
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
our
first
year
here
,
''
she
answered
,
in
a
distant
,
rather
*NL*
superior
way
,
drawing
back
and
going
indoors
.
He
did
not
notice
,
but
*NL*
went
his
round
of
exploration
.
Presently
his
mother
came
out
,
and
they
*NL*
went
through
the
buildings
.
Paul
was
hugely
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
suppose
you
have
the
fowls
and
calves
and
pigs
to
look
after
?
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Morel
to
Mrs.
Leivers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
little
woman
.
``
I
ca
n't
find
time
to
look
after
cattle
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
not
used
to
it
.
It
's
as
much
as
I
can
do
to
keep
going
in
the
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
suppose
it
is
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
girl
came
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tea
is
ready
,
mother
,
''
she
said
in
a
musical
,
quiet
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
,
Miriam
,
then
we
'll
come
,
''
replied
her
mother
,
almost
*NL*
ingratiatingly
.
``
Would
you
CARE
to
have
tea
now
,
Mrs.
Morel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
Whenever
it
's
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
and
his
mother
and
Mrs.
Leivers
had
tea
together
.
Then
they
*NL*
went
out
into
the
wood
that
was
flooded
with
bluebells
,
while
fumy
*NL*
forget-me-nots
were
in
the
paths
.
The
mother
and
son
were
in
ecstasy
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
got
back
to
the
house
,
Mr.
Leivers
and
Edgar
,
the
eldest
*NL*
son
,
were
in
the
kitchen
.
Edgar
was
about
eighteen
.
Then
Geoffrey
and
*NL*
Maurice
,
big
lads
of
twelve
and
thirteen
,
were
in
from
school
.
Mr.
*NL*
Leivers
was
a
good-looking
man
in
the
prime
of
life
,
with
a
golden-brown
*NL*
moustache
,
and
blue
eyes
screwed
up
against
the
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
were
condescending
,
but
Paul
scarcely
observed
it
.
They
went
*NL*
round
for
eggs
,
scrambling
into
all
sorts
of
places
.
As
they
were
*NL*
feeding
the
fowls
Miriam
came
out
.
The
boys
took
no
notice
of
her
.
One
*NL*
hen
,
with
her
yellow
chickens
,
was
in
a
coop
.
Maurice
took
his
hand
full
*NL*
of
corn
and
let
the
hen
peck
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Durst
you
do
it
?
''
he
asked
of
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
see
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
small
hand
,
warm
,
and
rather
capable-looking
.
Miriam
watched
.
*NL*
He
held
the
corn
to
the
hen
.
The
bird
eyed
it
with
her
hard
,
bright
eye
,
*NL*
and
suddenly
made
a
peck
into
his
hand
.
He
started
,
and
laughed
.
``
Rap
,
*NL*
rap
,
rap
!
''
went
the
bird
's
beak
in
his
palm
.
He
laughed
again
,
and
the
*NL*
other
boys
joined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
knocks
you
,
and
nips
you
,
but
she
never
hurts
,
''
said
Paul
,
when
the
*NL*
last
corn
had
gone
.
``
Now
,
Miriam
,
''
said
Maurice
,
``
you
come
an
`
ave
a
*NL*
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
cried
,
shrinking
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
baby
.
The
mardy-kid
!
''
said
her
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
hurt
a
bit
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
It
only
just
nips
rather
nicely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
still
cried
,
shaking
her
black
curls
and
shrinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
durs
n't
,
''
said
Geoffrey
.
``
She
niver
durst
do
anything
except
recite
*NL*
poitry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Durs
n't

off

She

but

*NL*
herself
somebody
.
`
The
Lady
of
the
Lake
.
'
Yah
!
''
cried
Maurice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
was
crimson
with
shame
and
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
do
more
than
you
,
''
she
cried
.
``
You
're
never
anything
but
cowards
*NL*
and
bullies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
cowards
and
bullies
!
''
they
repeated
mincingly
,
mocking
her
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
such
a
clown
shall
anger
me
,
*NL*
A
boor
is
answered
silently
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
he
quoted
against
her
,
shouting
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
indoors
.
Paul
went
with
the
boys
into
the
orchard
,
where
they
*NL*
had
rigged
up
a
parallel
bar
.
They
did
feats
of
strength
.
He
was
more
*NL*
agile
than
strong
,
but
it
served
.
He
fingered
a
piece
of
apple-blossom
*NL*
that
hung
low
on
a
swinging
bough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
get
the
apple-blossom
,
''
said
Edgar
,
the
eldest
brother
.
*NL*
``
There
'll
be
no
apples
next
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
n't
going
to
get
it
,
''
replied
Paul
,
going
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
felt
hostile
to
him
;
they
were
more
interested
in
their
own
*NL*
pursuits
.
He
wandered
back
to
the
house
to
look
for
his
mother
.
As
he
*NL*
went
round
the
back
,
he
saw
Miriam
kneeling
in
front
of
the
hen-coop
,
*NL*
some
maize
in
her
hand
,
biting
her
lip
,
and
crouching
in
an
intense
*NL*
attitude
.
The
hen
was
eyeing
her
wickedly
.
Very
gingerly
she
put
forward
*NL*
her
hand
.
The
hen
bobbed
for
her
.
She
drew
back
quickly
with
a
cry
,
half
*NL*
of
fear
,
half
of
chagrin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
hurt
you
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
crimson
and
started
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
wanted
to
try
,
''
she
said
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
it
does
n't
hurt
,
''
he
said
,
and
,
putting
only
two
corns
in
his
*NL*
palm
,
he
let
the
hen
peck
,
peck
,
peck
at
his
bare
hand
.
``
It
only
makes
*NL*
you
laugh
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hand
forward
and
dragged
it
away
,
tried
again
,
and
started
*NL*
back
with
a
cry
.
He
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
'd
let
her
take
corn
from
my
face
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
only
she
bumps
a
*NL*
bit
.
She
's
ever
so
neat
.
If
she
was
n't
,
look
how
much
ground
she
'd
peck
*NL*
up
every
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
grimly
,
and
watched
.
At
last
Miriam
let
the
bird
peck
from
*NL*
her
hand
.
She
gave
a
little
cry
--
fear
,
and
pain
because
of
fear
--
rather
*NL*
pathetic
.
But
she
had
done
it
,
and
she
did
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
,
''
said
the
boy
.
``
It
does
n't
hurt
,
does
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
with
dilated
dark
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
laughed
,
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
rose
and
went
indoors
.
She
seemed
to
be
in
some
way
resentful
*NL*
of
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
I
'm
only
a
common
girl
,
''
she
thought
,
and
she
wanted
to
prove
*NL*
she
was
a
grand
person
like
the
``
Lady
of
the
Lake
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
found
his
mother
ready
to
go
home
.
She
smiled
on
her
son
.
He
took
*NL*
the
great
bunch
of
flowers
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Leivers
walked
down
the
fields
*NL*
with
them
.
The
hills
were
golden
with
evening
;
deep
in
the
woods
showed
*NL*
the
darkening
purple
of
bluebells
.
It
was
everywhere
perfectly
stiff
,
*NL*
save
for
the
rustling
of
leaves
and
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
a
beautiful
place
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Mr.
Leivers
;
``
it
's
a
nice
little
place
,
if
only
it
*NL*
were
n't
for
the
rabbits
.
The
pasture
's
bitten
down
to
nothing
.
I
dunno
*NL*
if
ever
I
s
'll
get
the
rent
off
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
clapped
his
hands
,
and
the
field
broke
into
motion
near
the
woods
,
*NL*
brown
rabbits
hopping
everywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
believe
it
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
and
Paul
went
on
alone
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
it
lovely
,
mother
?
''
he
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
thin
moon
was
coming
out
.
His
heart
was
full
of
happiness
till
it
*NL*
hurt
.
His
mother
had
to
chatter
,
because
she
,
too
,
wanted
to
cry
with
*NL*
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
WOULD
N'T

that
man

she
said
.
``
WOULD
N'T

And
I
'D
learn

I

talk
with

I

with

My

I

But
there

she

the
strength

she
simply
has

the
*NL*
strength

She
ought
never
to
have
been
burdened
like
it
,
you
know

I

*NL*
sorry
for

I

My

if

I

should
n't

a

she
's
very
lovable

William
came
home
again
with
his
sweetheart
at
the
Whitsuntide
.
He
had
*NL*
one
week
of
his
holidays
then
.
It
was
beautiful
weather
.
As
a
rule
,
*NL*
William
and
Lily
and
Paul
went
out
in
the
morning
together
for
a
walk
.
*NL*
William
did
not
talk
to
his
beloved
much
,
except
to
tell
her
things
from
*NL*
his
boyhood
.
Paul
talked
endlessly
to
both
of
them
.
They
lay
down
,
all
*NL*
three
,
in
a
meadow
by
Minton
Church
.
On
one
side
,
by
the
Castle
Farm
,
*NL*
was
a
beautiful
quivering
screen
of
poplars
.
Hawthorn
was
dropping
*NL*
from
the
hedges
;
penny
daisies
and
ragged
robin
were
in
the
field
,
like
*NL*
laughter
.
William
,
a
big
fellow
of
twenty-three
,
thinner
now
and
even
a
*NL*
bit
gaunt
,
lay
back
in
the
sunshine
and
dreamed
,
while
she
fingered
with
*NL*
his
hair
.
Paul
went
gathering
the
big
daisies
.
She
had
taken
off
her
*NL*
hat
;
her
hair
was
black
as
a
horse
's
mane
.
Paul
came
back
and
threaded
*NL*
daisies
in
her
jet-black
hair
--
big
spangles
of
white
and
yellow
,
and
*NL*
just
a
pink
touch
of
ragged
robin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
look
like
a
young
witch-woman
,
''
the
boy
said
to
her
.
``
Does
n't
*NL*
she
,
William
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lily
laughed
.
William
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
.
In
his
gaze
was
*NL*
a
certain
baffled
look
of
misery
and
fierce
appreciation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
made
a
sight
of
me
?
''
she
asked
,
laughing
down
on
her
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
has
!
''
said
William
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
.
Her
beauty
seemed
to
hurt
him
.
He
glanced
at
her
*NL*
flower-decked
head
and
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
nice
enough
,
if
that
's
what
you
want
to
know
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
walked
without
her
hat
.
In
a
little
while
William
recovered
,
and
*NL*
was
rather
tender
to
her
.
Coming
to
a
bridge
,
he
carved
her
initials
and
*NL*
his
in
a
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
L.
L.
W.
*NL*
*NL*
W.
M
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
watched
his
strong
,
nervous
hand
,
with
its
glistening
hairs
and
*NL*
freckles
,
as
he
carved
,
and
she
seemed
fascinated
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
there
was
a
feeling
of
sadness
and
warmth
,
and
a
certain
*NL*
tenderness
in
the
house
,
whilst
William
and
Lily
were
at
home
.
But
often
*NL*
he
got
irritable
.
She
had
brought
,
for
an
eight-days
'
stay
,
five
dresses
*NL*
and
six
blouses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
would
you
mind
,
''
she
said
to
Annie
,
``
washing
me
these
two
blouses
,
*NL*
and
these
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Annie
stood
washing
when
William
and
Lily
went
out
the
next
morning
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
was
furious
.
And
sometimes
the
young
man
,
catching
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
his
sweetheart
's
attitude
towards
his
sister
,
hated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
morning
she
looked
very
beautiful
in
a
dress
of
foulard
,
silky
*NL*
and
sweeping
,
and
blue
as
a
jay-bird
's
feather
,
and
in
a
large
cream
hat
*NL*
covered
with
many
roses
,
mostly
crimson
.
Nobody
could
admire
her
enough
.
*NL*
But
in
the
evening
,
when
she
was
going
out
,
she
asked
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chubby
,
have
you
got
my
gloves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
?
''
asked
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
new
black
SUEDE
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
hunt
.
She
had
lost
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
mother
,
''
said
William
,
``
that
's
the
fourth
pair
she
's
lost
*NL*
since
Christmas
--
at
five
shillings
a
pair
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
only
gave
me
TWO
of
them
,
''
she
remonstrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
evening
,
after
supper
,
he
stood
on
the
hearthrug
whilst
she
*NL*
sat
on
the
sofa
,
and
he
seemed
to
hate
her
.
In
the
afternoon
he
had
*NL*
left
her
whilst
he
went
to
see
some
old
friend
.
She
had
sat
looking
at
a
*NL*
book
.
After
supper
William
wanted
to
write
a
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
your
book
,
Lily
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
Would
you
care
to
go
on
*NL*
with
it
for
a
few
minutes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
said
the
girl
.
``
I
will
sit
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
so
dull
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
William
scribbled
irritably
at
a
great
rate
.
As
he
sealed
the
envelope
*NL*
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Read
a
book
!
Why
,
she
's
never
read
a
book
in
her
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
go
along
!
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
cross
with
the
exaggeration
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
,
mother
--
she
has
n't
,
''
he
cried
,
jumping
up
and
taking
his
old
*NL*
position
on
the
hearthrug
.
``
She
's
never
read
a
book
in
her
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Er
's
like
me
,
''
chimed
in
Morel
.
''
`
Er
canna
see
what
there
is

books

*NL*

borin

your

nor
more
can
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
should
n't
say
these
things
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
to
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
true
,
mother
--
she
CA
N'T
read
.
What
did
you
give
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
gave
her
a
little
thing
of
Annie
Swan
's
.
Nobody
wants
to
read
*NL*
dry
stuff
on
Sunday
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
bet
she
did
n't
read
ten
lines
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
''
said
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
Lily
sat
miserably
on
the
sofa
.
He
turned
to
her
swiftly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
DID
you
read
any
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
many
pages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
ONE
THING
you
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
got
beyond
the
second
page
.
He
read
a
great
deal
,
and
had
a
*NL*
quick
,
active
intelligence
.
She
could
understand
nothing
but
love-making
*NL*
and
chatter
.
He
was
accustomed
to
having
all
his
thoughts
sifted
through
*NL*
his
mother
's
mind
;
so
,
when
he
wanted
companionship
,
and
was
asked
in
*NL*
reply
to
be
the
billing
and
twittering
lover
,
he
hated
his
betrothed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
mother
,
''
he
said
,
when
he
was
alone
with
her
at
night
,
``
she
's
*NL*
no
idea
of
money

she
's
so
wessel-brained

When
she
's
paid

she
'll
*NL*
suddenly
buy
such
rot
as
marrons
glaces
,
and
then
I
have
to
buy
her
*NL*
season
ticket
,
and
her
extras
,
even
her
underclothing
.
And
she
wants
to
*NL*
get
married
,
and
I
think
myself
we
might
as
well
get
married
next
year
.
*NL*
But
at
this
rate
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
mess
of
a
marriage
it
would
be

replied
his
mother
.
``
I
should
*NL*
consider
it
again

my
boy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
I
've
gone
too
far
to
break
off
now

he
said
,
``
and
so
I
shall
*NL*
get
married
as
soon
as
I
can

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

my

If

you
will

there
's
no
stopping
you

I
tell
you

I
ca
n't
sleep
when
I

about
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

she
'll
be
all
right

We
shall
manage

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
lets
you
buy
her
underclothing
?

asked
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
he
began
apologetically
,
``
she
did
n't
ask
me
;
but
one
*NL*
morning
--
and
it
WAS
cold
--
I
found
her
on
the
station
shivering
,
not
able
*NL*
to
keep
still
;
so
I
asked
her
if
she
was
well
wrapped
up
.
She
said
:
'
I
*NL*
think
so
.
'
So
I
said
:
`
Have
you
got
warm
underthings
on
?
'
And
she
*NL*
said
:
`
No
,
they
were
cotton
.
'
I
asked
her
why
on
earth
she
had
n't
got
*NL*
something
thicker
on
in
weather
like
that
,
and
she
said
because
she
HAD
*NL*
nothing
.
And
there
she
is
--
a
bronchial
subject
!
I
HAD
to
take
her
and
*NL*
get
some
warm
things
.
Well
,
mother
,
I
should
n't
mind
the
money
if
we
*NL*
had
any
.
And
,
you
know
,
she
OUGHT
to
keep
enough
to
pay
for
her
*NL*
season-ticket
;
but
no
,
she
comes
to
me
about
that
,
and
I
have
to
find
*NL*
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
poor
lookout
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
pale
,
and
his
rugged
face
,
that
used
to
be
so
perfectly
careless
*NL*
and
laughing
,
was
stamped
with
conflict
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
ca
n't
give
her
up
now
;
it
's
gone
too
far
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
,
*NL*
besides
,
for
SOME
things
I
could
n't
do
without
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
boy
,
remember
you
're
taking
your
life
in
your
hands
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
.
``
NOTHING
is
as
bad
as
a
marriage
that
's
a
hopeless
failure
.
Mine
*NL*
was
bad
enough
,
God
knows
,
and
ought
to
teach
you
something
;
but
it
*NL*
might
have
been
worse
by
a
long
chalk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
with
his
back
against
the
side
of
the
chimney-piece
,
his
hands
*NL*
in
his
pockets
.
He
was
a
big
,
raw-boned
man
,
who
looked
as
if
he
would
*NL*
go
to
the
world
's
end
if
he
wanted
to
.
But
she
saw
the
despair
on
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
give
her
up
now
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
said
,
``
remember
there
are
worse
wrongs
than
breaking
off
an
*NL*
engagement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
give
her
up
NOW
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
ticked
on
;
mother
and
son
remained
in
silence
,
a
conflict
*NL*
between
them
;
but
he
would
say
no
more
.
At
last
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
to
bed
,
my
son
.
You
'll
feel
better
in
the
morning
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
you
'll
know
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
,
and
went
.
She
raked
the
fire
.
Her
heart
was
heavy
now
*NL*
as
it
had
never
been
.
Before
,
with
her
husband
,
things
had
seemed
to
be
*NL*
breaking
down
in
her
,
but
they
did
not
destroy
her
power
to
live
.
Now
*NL*
her
soul
felt
lamed
in
itself
.
It
was
her
hope
that
was
struck
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
often
William
manifested
the
same
hatred
towards
his
betrothed
.
*NL*
On
the
last
evening
at
home
he
was
railing
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
you
do
n't
believe
me
,
what
she
's
like
,
would
you
*NL*
believe
she
has
been
confirmed
three
times
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
!
''
laughed
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
or
not
,
she
HAS
!
That
's
what
confirmation
means
for
her
--
a
bit
*NL*
of
a
theatrical
show
where
she
can
cut
a
figure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have

cried
the
girl
--
``
I

is
not
true

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

''
he
cried
,
flashing
round
on
her
.
``
Once
in
Bromley

once
in
*NL*
Beckenham

once
somewhere

*NL*
*NL*

she
said

in

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

And

*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
I
was
only
fourteen

Mrs.

she
pleaded

tears
in
her
eyes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

said
Mrs.
Morel
;
``
I
can
quite
understand

William

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it

not

*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
sat
on
the
sofa
,
crying
.
She
was
not
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
LOVE
!
''
he
cried
,
``
you
might
as
well
ask
a
fly
to
love
you
!
It
'll
*NL*
love
settling
on
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
say
no
more
,
''
commanded
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
If
you
want
to
say
these
*NL*
things
,
you
must
find
another
place
than
this
.
I
am
ashamed
of
you
,
*NL*
William
!
Why
do
n't
you
be
more
manly
.
To
do
nothing
but
find
fault
with
*NL*
a
girl
,
and
then
pretend
you
're
engaged
to
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
subsided
in
wrath
and
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
was
silent
,
and
later
he
repented
,
kissed
and
comforted
the
*NL*
girl
.
Yet
it
was
true
,
what
he
had
said
.
He
hated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
going
away
,
Mrs.
Morel
accompanied
them
as
far
as
*NL*
Nottingham
.
It
was
a
long
way
to
Keston
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
mother
,
''
he
said
to
her
,
``
Gyp
's
shallow
.
Nothing
goes
deep
*NL*
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
William
,
I
WISH
you
would
n't
say
these
things
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
very
*NL*
uncomfortable
for
the
girl
who
walked
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
does
n't
,
mother
.
She
's
very
much
in
love
with
me
now
,
but
if
I
*NL*
died
she
'd
have
forgotten
me
in
three
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
was
afraid
.
Her
heart
beat
furiously
,
hearing
the
quiet
*NL*
bitterness
of
her
son
's
last
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
she
replied
.
``
You
DO
N'T
know
,
and
therefore
you
've
no
*NL*
right
to
say
such
a
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
always
saying
these
things
!
''
cried
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
three
months
after
I
was
buried
you
'd
have
somebody
else
,
and
I
*NL*
should
be
forgotten
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
that
's
your
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
saw
them
into
the
train
in
Nottingham
,
then
she
returned
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
one
comfort
,
''
she
said
to
Paul
--
``
he
'll
never
have
any
money
to
*NL*
marry
on
,
that
I
AM
sure
of
.
And
so
she
'll
save
him
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
took
cheer
.
Matters
were
not
yet
very
desperate
.
She
firmly
*NL*
believed
William
would
never
marry
his
Gipsy
.
She
waited
,
and
she
kept
*NL*
Paul
near
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
summer
long
William
's
letters
had
a
feverish
tone
;
he
seemed
*NL*
unnatural
and
intense
.
Sometimes
he
was
exaggeratedly
jolly
,
usually
he
*NL*
was
flat
and
bitter
in
his
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
his
mother
said
,
``
I
'm
afraid
he
's
ruining
himself
against
that
*NL*
creature
,
who
is
n't
worthy
of
his
love
--
no
,
no
more
than
a
rag
doll
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
come
home
.
The
midsummer
holiday
was
gone
;
it
was
a
long
*NL*
while
to
Christmas
.
He
wrote
in
wild
excitement
,
saying
he
could
come
*NL*
for
Saturday
and
Sunday
at
Goose
Fair
,
the
first
week
in
October
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
well
,
my
boy
,
''
said
his
mother
,
when
she
saw
him
.
She
was
*NL*
almost
in
tears
at
having
him
to
herself
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
've
not
been
well
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
've
seemed
to
have
a
dragging
cold
*NL*
all
the
last
month
,
but
it
's
going
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
sunny
October
weather
.
He
seemed
wild
with
joy
,
like
a
schoolboy
*NL*
escaped
;
then
again
he
was
silent
and
reserved
.
He
was
more
gaunt
than
*NL*
ever
,
and
there
was
a
haggard
look
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
doing
too
much
,
''
said
his
mother
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
doing
extra
work
,
trying
to
make
some
money
to
marry
on
,
he
said
.
*NL*
He
only
talked
to
his
mother
once
on
the
Saturday
night
;
then
he
was
sad
*NL*
and
tender
about
his
beloved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
you
know
,
mother
,
for
all
that
,
if
I
died
she
'd
be
*NL*
broken-hearted
for
two
months
,
and
then
she
'd
start
to
forget
me
.
You
'd
*NL*
see
,
she
'd
never
come
home
here
to
look
at
my
grave
,
not
even
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
William
,
''
said
his
mother
,
``
you
're
not
going
to
die
,
so
why
talk
*NL*
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
whether
or
not
--
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
ca
n't
help
it
.
She
is
like
that
,
and
if
you
choose
her
--
well
,
*NL*
you
ca
n't
grumble
,
''
said
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Sunday
morning
,
as
he
was
putting
his
collar
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
''
he
said
to
his
mother
,
holding
up
his
chin
,
``
what
a
rash
my
*NL*
collar
's
made
under
my
chin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
at
the
junction
of
chin
and
throat
was
a
big
red
inflammation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ought
not
to
do
that
,
''
said
his
mother
.
``
Here
,
put
a
bit
of
this
*NL*
soothing
ointment
on
.
You
should
wear
different
collars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
away
on
Sunday
midnight
,
seeming
better
and
more
solid
for
his
*NL*
two
days
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Tuesday
morning
came
a
telegram
from
London
that
he
was
ill
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
got
off
her
knees
from
washing
the
floor
,
read
the
telegram
,
*NL*
called
a
neighbour
,
went
to
her
landlady
and
borrowed
a
sovereign
,
put
*NL*
on
her
things
,
and
set
off
.
She
hurried
to
Keston
,
caught
an
express
for
*NL*
London
in
Nottingham
.
She
had
to
wait
in
Nottingham
nearly
an
hour
.
A
*NL*
small
figure
in
her
black
bonnet
,
she
was
anxiously
asking
the
porters
*NL*
if
they
knew
how
to
get
to
Elmers
End
.
The
journey
was
three
hours
.
She
*NL*
sat
in
her
corner
in
a
kind
of
stupor
,
never
moving
.
At
King
's
Cross
*NL*
still
no
one
could
tell
her
how
to
get
to
Elmers
End
.
Carrying
her
*NL*
string
bag
,
that
contained
her
nightdress
,
a
comb
and
brush
,
she
went
*NL*
from
person
to
person
.
At
last
they
sent
her
underground
to
Cannon
*NL*
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
six
o'clock
when
she
arrived
at
William
's
lodging
.
The
blinds
*NL*
were
not
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
he
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
better
,
''
said
the
landlady
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
the
woman
upstairs
.
William
lay
on
the
bed
,
with
bloodshot
*NL*
eyes
,
his
face
rather
discoloured
.
The
clothes
were
tossed
about
,
there
*NL*
was
no
fire
in
the
room
,
a
glass
of
milk
stood
on
the
stand
at
his
*NL*
bedside
.
No
one
had
been
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
my
son
!
''
said
the
mother
bravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
.
He
looked
at
her
,
but
did
not
see
her
.
Then
he
began
*NL*
to
say
,
in
a
dull
voice
,
as
if
repeating
a
letter
from
dictation
:
``
Owing
*NL*
to
a
leakage
in
the
hold
of
this
vessel
,
the
sugar
had
set
,
and
become
*NL*
converted
into
rock
.
It
needed
hacking
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
quite
unconscious
.
It
had
been
his
business
to
examine
some
such
*NL*
cargo
of
sugar
in
the
Port
of
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
has
he
been
like
this
?
''
the
mother
asked
the
landlady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
got
home
at
six
o'clock
on
Monday
morning
,
and
he
seemed
to
sleep
*NL*
all
day
;
then
in
the
night
we
heard
him
talking
,
and
this
morning
he
*NL*
asked
for
you
.
So
I
wired
,
and
we
fetched
the
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
have
a
fire
made
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
tried
to
soothe
her
son
,
to
keep
him
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
came
.
It
was
pneumonia
,
and
,
he
said
,
a
peculiar
erysipelas
,
*NL*
which
had
started
under
the
chin
where
the
collar
chafed
,
and
was
*NL*
spreading
over
the
face
.
He
hoped
it
would
not
get
to
the
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
settled
down
to
nurse
.
She
prayed
for
William
,
prayed
that
he
*NL*
would
recognise
her
.
But
the
young
man
's
face
grew
more
discoloured
.
*NL*
In
the
night
she
struggled
with
him
.
He
raved
,
and
raved
,
and
would
not
*NL*
come
to
consciousness
.
At
two
o'clock
,
in
a
dreadful
paroxysm
,
he
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
sat
perfectly
still
for
an
hour
in
the
lodging
bedroom
;
then
*NL*
she
roused
the
household
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
o'clock
,
with
the
aid
of
the
charwoman
,
she
laid
him
out
;
then
*NL*
she
went
round
the
dreary
London
village
to
the
registrar
and
the
*NL*
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
to
the
cottage
on
Scargill
Street
came
another
wire
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
William
died
last
night
.
Let
father
come
,
bring
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
,
Paul
,
and
Arthur
were
at
home
;
Mr.
Morel
was
gone
to
work
.
The
*NL*
three
children
said
not
a
word
.
Annie
began
to
whimper
with
fear
;
Paul
*NL*
set
off
for
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
beautiful
day
.
At
Brinsley
pit
the
white
steam
melted
slowly
in
*NL*
the
sunshine
of
a
soft
blue
sky
;
the
wheels
of
the
headstocks
twinkled
*NL*
high
up
;
the
screen
,
shuffling
its
coal
into
the
trucks
,
made
a
busy
*NL*
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
my
father
;
he
's
got
to
go
to
London
,
''
said
the
boy
to
the
first
*NL*
man
he
met
on
the
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

wants
Walter
Morel

Go

*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
into
the
little
top
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
man
went
to
the
telephone
and
rang
up
the
bottom
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walter
Morel
's
wanted

Summat

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
round
to
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
be
up
in
a
few
minutes
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
wandered
out
to
the
pit-top
.
He
watched
the
chair
come
up
,
with
its
*NL*
wagon
of
coal
.
The
great
iron
cage
sank
back
on
its
rest
,
a
full
carfle
*NL*
was
hauled
off
,
an
empty
tram
run
on
to
the
chair
,
a
bell
ting
`
ed
*NL*
somewhere
,
the
chair
heaved
,
then
dropped
like
a
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
did
not
realise
William
was
dead
;
it
was
impossible
,
with
such
*NL*
a
bustle
going
on
.
The
puller-off
swung
the
small
truck
on
to
the
*NL*
turn-table
,
another
man
ran
with
it
along
the
bank
down
the
curving
*NL*
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
William
is
dead
,
and
my
mother
's
in
London
,
and
what
will
she
be
*NL*
doing
?
''
the
boy
asked
himself
,
as
if
it
were
a
conundrum
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
chair
after
chair
come
up
,
and
still
no
father
.
At
last
,
*NL*
standing
beside
a
wagon
,
a
man
's
form
!
the
chair
sank
on
its
rests
,
*NL*
Morel
stepped
off
.
He
was
slightly
lame
from
an
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
thee
,
Paul
?
Is

e
worse

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
to
go
to
London

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
walked
off
the
pit-bank
,
where
men
were
watching
curiously
.
As
*NL*
they
came
out
and
went
along
the
railway
,
with
the
sunny
autumn
field
on
*NL*
one
side
and
a
wall
of
trucks
on
the
other
,
Morel
said
in
a
frightened
*NL*
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
E

niver
gone

child

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Last

We
had
a
telegram
from
my
mother

*NL*
*NL*
Morel
walked
on
a
few
strides
,
then
leaned
up
against
a
truck-side
,
*NL*
his
hand
over
his
eyes
.
He
was
not
crying
.
Paul
stood
looking
round
,
*NL*
waiting
.
On
the
weighing
machine
a
truck
trundled
slowly
.
Paul
saw
*NL*
everything
,
except
his
father
leaning
against
the
truck
as
if
he
were
*NL*
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
had
only
once
before
been
to
London
.
He
set
off
,
scared
and
*NL*
peaked
,
to
help
his
wife
.
That
was
on
Tuesday
.
The
children
were
left
*NL*
alone
in
the
house
.
Paul
went
to
work
,
Arthur
went
to
school
,
and
Annie
*NL*
had
in
a
friend
to
be
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Saturday
night
,
as
Paul
was
turning
the
corner
,
coming
home
from
*NL*
Keston
,
he
saw
his
mother
and
father
,
who
had
come
to
Sethley
Bridge
*NL*
Station
.
They
were
walking
in
silence
in
the
dark
,
tired
,
straggling
*NL*
apart
.
The
boy
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
''
he
said
,
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
's
small
figure
seemed
not
to
observe
.
He
spoke
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
!
''
she
said
,
uninterestedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
let
him
kiss
her
,
but
she
seemed
unaware
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
house
she
was
the
same
--
small
,
white
,
and
mute
.
She
noticed
*NL*
nothing
,
she
said
nothing
,
only
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
coffin
will
be
here
to-night
,
Walter
.
You
'd
better
see
about
some
*NL*
help
.
''
Then
,
turning
to
the
children
:
``
We
're
bringing
him
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
relapsed
into
the
same
mute
looking
into
space
,
her
hands
*NL*
folded
on
her
lap
.
Paul
,
looking
at
her
,
felt
he
could
not
breathe
.
The
*NL*
house
was
dead
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
work
,
mother
,
''
he
said
plaintively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
?
''
she
answered
,
dully
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
half
an
hour
Morel
,
troubled
and
bewildered
,
came
in
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wheer
s
'll
we
ha'e
him
when
he
DOES
come
?
''
he
asked
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
front-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'd
better
shift
th
'
table
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
ha'e
him
across
th
'
chairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
there
--
Yes
,
I
suppose
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
and
Paul
went
,
with
a
candle
,
into
the
parlour
.
There
was
no
gas
*NL*
there
.
The
father
unscrewed
the
top
of
the
big
mahogany
oval
table
,
and
*NL*
cleared
the
middle
of
the
room
;
then
he
arranged
six
chairs
opposite
*NL*
each
other
,
so
that
the
coffin
could
stand
on
their
beds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
niver
seed
such
a
length
as
he
is
!
''
said
the
miner
,
and
watching
*NL*
anxiously
as
he
worked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
to
the
bay
window
and
looked
out
.
The
ash-tree
stood
monstrous
*NL*
and
black
in
front
of
the
wide
darkness
.
It
was
a
faintly
luminous
*NL*
night
.
Paul
went
back
to
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
Morel
called
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
started
.
There
was
a
noise
of
unbarring
and
unlocking
the
front
*NL*
door
,
which
opened
straight
from
the
night
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
another
candle
,
''
called
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
and
Arthur
went
.
Paul
followed
with
his
mother
.
He
stood
with
his
*NL*
arm
round
her
waist
in
the
inner
doorway
.
Down
the
middle
of
the
cleared
*NL*
room
waited
six
chairs
,
face
to
face
.
In
the
window
,
against
the
lace
*NL*
curtains
,
Arthur
held
up
one
candle
,
and
by
the
open
door
,
against
the
*NL*
night
,
Annie
stood
leaning
forward
,
her
brass
candlestick
glittering
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
noise
of
wheels
.
Outside
in
the
darkness
of
the
street
*NL*
below
Paul
could
see
horses
and
a
black
vehicle
,
one
lamp
,
and
a
few
*NL*
pale
faces
;
then
some
men
,
miners
,
all
in
their
shirt-sleeves
,
seemed
to
*NL*
struggle
in
the
obscurity
.
Presently
two
men
appeared
,
bowed
beneath
a
*NL*
great
weight
.
It
was
Morel
and
his
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Steady
!
''
called
Morel
,
out
of
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
his
fellow
mounted
the
steep
garden
step
,
heaved
into
the
*NL*
candlelight
with
their
gleaming
coffin-end
.
Limbs
of
other
men
were
seen
*NL*
struggling
behind
.
Morel
and
Burns
,
in
front
,
staggered
;
the
great
dark
*NL*
weight
swayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Steady
,
steady
!
''
cried
Morel
,
as
if
in
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
six
bearers
were
up
in
the
small
garden
,
holding
the
great
*NL*
coffin
aloft
.
There
were
three
more
steps
to
the
door
.
The
yellow
lamp
*NL*
of
the
carriage
shone
alone
down
the
black
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
!
''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coffin
swayed
,
the
men
began
to
mount
the
three
steps
with
their
*NL*
load
.
Annie
's
candle
flickered
,
and
she
whimpered
as
the
first
men
*NL*
appeared
,
and
the
limbs
and
bowed
heads
of
six
men
struggled
to
climb
*NL*
into
the
room
,
bearing
the
coffin
that
rode
like
sorrow
on
their
living
*NL*
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
son
--
my
son
!
''
Mrs.
Morel
sang
softly
,
and
each
time
the
coffin
*NL*
swung
to
the
unequal
climbing
of
the
men
:
``
Oh
,
my
son
--
my
son
--
my
son
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
''
Paul
whimpered
,
his
hand
round
her
waist
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
son
--
my
son
!
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
saw
drops
of
sweat
fall
from
his
father
's
brow
.
Six
men
were
in
*NL*
the
room
--
six
coatless
men
,
with
yielding
,
struggling
limbs
,
filling
*NL*
the
room
and
knocking
against
the
furniture
.
The
coffin
veered
,
and
was
*NL*
gently
lowered
on
to
the
chairs
.
The
sweat
fell
from
Morel
's
face
on
its
*NL*
boards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
,
he
's
a
weight
!
''
said
a
man
,
and
the
five
miners
sighed
,
bowed
,
*NL*
and
,
trembling
with
the
struggle
,
descended
the
steps
again
,
closing
the
*NL*
door
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
was
alone
in
the
parlour
with
the
great
polished
box
.
*NL*
William
,
when
laid
out
,
was
six
feet
four
inches
long
.
Like
a
monument
*NL*
lay
the
bright
brown
,
ponderous
coffin
.
Paul
thought
it
would
never
be
*NL*
got
out
of
the
room
again
.
His
mother
was
stroking
the
polished
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
buried
him
on
the
Monday
in
the
little
cemetery
on
the
hillside
*NL*
that
looks
over
the
fields
at
the
big
church
and
the
houses
.
It
was
*NL*
sunny
,
and
the
white
chrysanthemums
frilled
themselves
in
the
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
could
not
be
persuaded
,
after
this
,
to
talk
and
take
her
old
*NL*
bright
interest
in
life
.
She
remained
shut
off
.
All
the
way
home
in
the
*NL*
train
she
had
said
to
herself
:
``
If
only
it
could
have
been
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Paul
came
home
at
night
he
found
his
mother
sitting
,
her
day
's
work
*NL*
done
,
with
hands
folded
in
her
lap
upon
her
coarse
apron
.
She
always
*NL*
used
to
have
changed
her
dress
and
put
on
a
black
apron
,
before
.
Now
*NL*
Annie
set
his
supper
,
and
his
mother
sat
looking
blankly
in
front
of
*NL*
her
,
her
mouth
shut
tight
.
Then
he
beat
his
brains
for
news
to
tell
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
Miss
Jordan
was
down
to-day
,
and
she
said
my
sketch
of
a
*NL*
colliery
at
work
was
beautiful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Morel
took
no
notice
.
Night
after
night
he
forced
himself
to
*NL*
tell
her
things
,
although
she
did
not
listen
.
It
drove
him
almost
insane
*NL*
to
have
her
thus
.
At
last
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a-matter
,
mother
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a-matter
?
''
he
persisted
.
``
Mother
,
what
's
a-matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
's
the
matter
,
''
she
said
irritably
,
turning
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
--
he
was
sixteen
years
old
--
went
to
bed
drearily
.
He
was
cut
off
*NL*
and
wretched
through
October
,
November
and
December
.
His
mother
tried
,
*NL*
but
she
could
not
rouse
herself
.
She
could
only
brood
on
her
dead
son
;
*NL*
he
had
been
let
to
die
so
cruelly
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
on
December
23
,
with
his
five
shillings
Christmas-box
in
his
*NL*
pocket
,
Paul
wandered
blindly
home
.
His
mother
looked
at
him
,
and
her
*NL*
heart
stood
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
badly
,
mother
!
''
he
replied
.
``
Mr.
Jordan
gave
me
five
shillings
for
*NL*
a
Christmas-box
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
handed
it
to
her
with
trembling
hands
.
She
put
it
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
n't
glad
!
''
he
reproached
her
;
but
he
trembled
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
hurts
you
?
''
she
said
,
unbuttoning
his
overcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
old
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
badly
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
undressed
him
and
put
him
to
bed
.
He
had
pneumonia
dangerously
,
the
*NL*
doctor
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
he
never
have
had
it
if
I
'd
kept
him
at
home
,
not
let
him
go
to
*NL*
Nottingham
?
''
was
one
of
the
first
things
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
might
not
have
been
so
bad
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
stood
condemned
on
her
own
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
watched
the
living
,
not
the
dead
,
''
she
told
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
very
ill
.
His
mother
lay
in
bed
at
nights
with
him
;
they
could
*NL*
not
afford
a
nurse
.
He
grew
worse
,
and
the
crisis
approached
.
One
*NL*
night
he
tossed
into
consciousness
in
the
ghastly
,
sickly
feeling
of
*NL*
dissolution
,
when
all
the
cells
in
the
body
seem
in
intense
irritability
*NL*
to
be
breaking
down
,
and
consciousness
makes
a
last
flare
of
struggle
,
*NL*
like
madness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
die
,
mother
!
''
he
cried
,
heaving
for
breath
on
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lifted
him
up
,
crying
in
a
small
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
son
--
my
son
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
brought
him
to
.
He
realised
her
.
His
whole
will
rose
up
and
*NL*
arrested
him
.
He
put
his
head
on
her
breast
,
and
took
ease
of
her
for
*NL*
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
some
things
,
''
said
his
aunt
,
``
it
was
a
good
thing
Paul
was
ill
that
*NL*
Christmas
.
I
believe
it
saved
his
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
in
bed
for
seven
weeks
.
He
got
up
white
and
fragile
.
His
father
*NL*
had
bought
him
a
pot
of
scarlet
and
gold
tulips
.
They
used
to
flame
in
*NL*
the
window
in
the
March
sunshine
as
he
sat
on
the
sofa
chattering
to
his
*NL*
mother
.
The
two
knitted
together
in
perfect
intimacy
.
Mrs.
Morel
's
life
*NL*
now
rooted
itself
in
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
had
been
a
prophet
.
Mrs.
Morel
had
a
little
present
and
a
letter
*NL*
from
Lily
at
Christmas
.
Mrs.
Morel
's
sister
had
a
letter
at
the
New
*NL*
Year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
at
a
ball
last
night
.
Some
delightful
people
were
there
,
and
I
*NL*
enjoyed
myself
thoroughly
,
''
said
the
letter
.
``
I
had
every
dance
--
did
not
*NL*
sit
out
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
never
heard
any
more
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
and
his
wife
were
gentle
with
each
other
for
some
time
after
the
*NL*
death
of
their
son
.
He
would
go
into
a
kind
of
daze
,
staring
wide-eyed
*NL*
and
blank
across
the
room
.
Then
he
got
up
suddenly
and
hurried
out
to
*NL*
the
Three
Spots
,
returning
in
his
normal
state
.
But
never
in
his
life
*NL*
would
he
go
for
a
walk
up
Shepstone
,
past
the
office
where
his
son
had
*NL*
worked
,
and
he
always
avoided
the
cemetery
.

PART

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
LAD-AND-GIRL
LOVE
*NL*
*NL*
PAUL
had
been
many
times
up
to
Willey
Farm
during
the
autumn
.
He
*NL*
was
friends
with
the
two
youngest
boys
.
Edgar
the
eldest
,
would
not
*NL*
condescend
at
first
.
And
Miriam
also
refused
to
be
approached
.
She
was
*NL*
afraid
of
being
set
at
nought
,
as
by
her
own
brothers
.
The
girl
was
*NL*
romantic
in
her
soul
.
Everywhere
was
a
Walter
Scott
heroine
being
*NL*
loved
by
men
with
helmets
or
with
plumes
in
their
caps
.
She
herself
was
*NL*
something
of
a
princess
turned
into
a
swine-girl
in
her
own
imagination
.
*NL*
And
she
was
afraid
lest
this
boy
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
looked
something
*NL*
like
a
Walter
Scott
hero
,
who
could
paint
and
speak
French
,
and
knew
*NL*
what
algebra
meant
,
and
who
went
by
train
to
Nottingham
every
day
,
might
*NL*
consider
her
simply
as
the
swine-girl
,
unable
to
perceive
the
princess
*NL*
beneath
;
so
she
held
aloof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
great
companion
was
her
mother
.
They
were
both
brown-eyed
,
and
*NL*
inclined
to
be
mystical
,
such
women
as
treasure
religion
inside
them
,
*NL*
breathe
it
in
their
nostrils
,
and
see
the
whole
of
life
in
a
mist
*NL*
thereof
.
So
to
Miriam
,
Christ
and
God
made
one
great
figure
,
which
she
*NL*
loved
tremblingly
and
passionately
when
a
tremendous
sunset
burned
*NL*
out
the
western
sky
,
and
Ediths
,
and
Lucys
,
and
Rowenas
,
Brian
de
Bois
*NL*
Guilberts
,
Rob
Roys
,
and
Guy
Mannerings
,
rustled
the
sunny
leaves
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
or
sat
in
her
bedroom
aloft
,
alone
,
when
it
snowed
.
That
was
*NL*
life
to
her
.
For
the
rest
,
she
drudged
in
the
house
,
which
work
she
*NL*
would
not
have
minded
had
not
her
clean
red
floor
been
mucked
up
*NL*
immediately
by
the
trampling
farm-boots
of
her
brothers
.
She
madly
*NL*
wanted
her
little
brother
of
four
to
let
her
swathe
him
and
stifle
*NL*
him
in
her
love
;
she
went
to
church
reverently
,
with
bowed
head
,
and
*NL*
quivered
in
anguish
from
the
vulgarity
of
the
other
choir-girls
and
from
*NL*
the
common-sounding
voice
of
the
curate
;
she
fought
with
her
brothers
,
*NL*
whom
she
considered
brutal
louts
;
and
she
held
not
her
father
in
too
*NL*
high
esteem
because
he
did
not
carry
any
mystical
ideals
cherished
in
*NL*
his
heart
,
but
only
wanted
to
have
as
easy
a
time
as
he
could
,
and
his
*NL*
meals
when
he
was
ready
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hated
her
position
as
swine-girl
.
She
wanted
to
be
considered
.
She
*NL*
wanted
to
learn
,
thinking
that
if
she
could
read
,
as
Paul
said
he
could
*NL*
read
,
``
Colomba
''
,
or
the
``
Voyage
autour
de
ma
Chambre
''
,
the
world
would
*NL*
have
a
different
face
for
her
and
a
deepened
respect
.
She
could
not
be
*NL*
princess
by
wealth
or
standing
.
So
she
was
mad
to
have
learning
whereon
*NL*
to
pride
herself
.
For
she
was
different
from
other
folk
,
and
must
not
*NL*
be
scooped
up
among
the
common
fry
.
Learning
was
the
only
distinction
to
*NL*
which
she
thought
to
aspire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
beauty
--
that
of
a
shy
,
wild
,
quiveringly
sensitive
thing
--
seemed
*NL*
nothing
to
her
.
Even
her
soul
,
so
strong
for
rhapsody
,
was
not
enough
.
*NL*
She
must
have
something
to
reinforce
her
pride
,
because
she
felt
*NL*
different
from
other
people
.
Paul
she
eyed
rather
wistfully
.
On
the
*NL*
whole
,
she
scorned
the
male
sex
.
But
here
was
a
new
specimen
,
quick
,
*NL*
light
,
graceful
,
who
could
be
gentle
and
who
could
be
sad
,
and
who
was
*NL*
clever
,
and
who
knew
a
lot
,
and
who
had
a
death
in
the
family
.
The
boy
's
*NL*
poor
morsel
of
learning
exalted
him
almost
sky-high
in
her
esteem
.
*NL*
Yet
she
tried
hard
to
scorn
him
,
because
he
would
not
see
in
her
the
*NL*
princess
but
only
the
swine-girl
.
And
he
scarcely
observed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
was
so
ill
,
and
she
felt
he
would
be
weak
.
Then
she
would
be
*NL*
stronger
than
he
.
Then
she
could
love
him
.
If
she
could
be
mistress
of
*NL*
him
in
his
weakness
,
take
care
of
him
,
if
he
could
depend
on
her
,
if
she
*NL*
could
,
as
it
were
,
have
him
in
her
arms
,
how
she
would
love
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
skies
brightened
and
plum-blossom
was
out
,
Paul
drove
off
*NL*
in
the
milkman
's
heavy
float
up
to
Willey
Farm
.
Mr.
Leivers
shouted
in
a
*NL*
kindly
fashion
at
the
boy
,
then
clicked
to
the
horse
as
they
climbed
the
*NL*
hill
slowly
,
in
the
freshness
of
the
morning
.
White
clouds
went
on
*NL*
their
way
,
crowding
to
the
back
of
the
hills
that
were
rousing
in
the
*NL*
springtime
.
The
water
of
Nethermere
lay
below
,
very
blue
against
the
*NL*
seared
meadows
and
the
thorn-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
four
and
a
half
miles
'
drive
.
Tiny
buds
on
the
hedges
,
vivid
*NL*
as
copper-green
,
were
opening
into
rosettes
;
and
thrushes
called
,
and
*NL*
blackbirds
shrieked
and
scolded
.
It
was
a
new
,
glamorous
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
,
peeping
through
the
kitchen
window
,
saw
the
horse
walk
through
*NL*
the
big
white
gate
into
the
farmyard
that
was
backed
by
the
oak-wood
,
*NL*
still
bare
.
Then
a
youth
in
a
heavy
overcoat
climbed
down
.
He
put
up
*NL*
his
hands
for
the
whip
and
the
rug
that
the
good-looking
,
ruddy
farmer
*NL*
handed
down
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
appeared
in
the
doorway
.
She
was
nearly
sixteen
,
very
beautiful
,
*NL*
with
her
warm
colouring
,
her
gravity
,
her
eyes
dilating
suddenly
like
an
*NL*
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
''
said
Paul
,
turning
shyly
aside
,
``
your
daffodils
are
nearly
out
.
*NL*
Is
n't
it
early
?
But
do
n't
they
look
cold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cold
!
''
said
Miriam
,
in
her
musical
,
caressing
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
green
on
their
buds
--
''
and
he
faltered
into
silence
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
take
the
rug
,
''
said
Miriam
over-gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
carry
it
,
''
he
answered
,
rather
injured
.
But
he
yielded
it
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Mrs.
Leivers
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
're
tired
and
cold
,
''
she
said
.
``
Let
me
take
your
coat
.
It
*NL*
IS
heavy
.
You
must
n't
walk
far
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
helped
him
off
with
his
coat
.
He
was
quite
unused
to
such
attention
.
*NL*
She
was
almost
smothered
under
its
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
mother
,
''
laughed
the
farmer
as
he
passed
through
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
swinging
the
great
milk-churns
,
``
you
've
got
almost
more
than
you
can
*NL*
manage
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
beat
up
the
sofa
cushions
for
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kitchen
was
very
small
and
irregular
.
The
farm
had
been
originally
*NL*
a
labourer
's
cottage
.
And
the
furniture
was
old
and
battered
.
But
Paul
*NL*
loved
it
--
loved
the
sack-bag
that
formed
the
hearthrug
,
and
the
funny
*NL*
little
corner
under
the
stairs
,
and
the
small
window
deep
in
the
corner
,
*NL*
through
which
,
bending
a
little
,
he
could
see
the
plum
trees
in
the
back
*NL*
garden
and
the
lovely
round
hills
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
lie
down
?
''
said
Mrs.
Leivers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
;
I
'm
not
tired
,
''
he
said
.
``
Is
n't
it
lovely
coming
out
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
think
?
I
saw
a
sloe-bush
in
blossom
and
a
lot
of
celandines
.
I
'm
glad
*NL*
it
's
sunny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
give
you
anything
to
eat
or
to
drink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
your
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
's
tired
now
.
I
think
she
's
had
too
much
to
do
.
Perhaps
in
a
*NL*
little
while
she
'll
go
to
Skegness
with
me
.
Then
she
'll
be
able
to
rest
.
*NL*
I
s
'll
be
glad
if
she
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Leivers
.
``
It
's
a
wonder
she
is
n't
ill
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
was
moving
about
preparing
dinner
.
Paul
watched
everything
that
*NL*
happened
.
His
face
was
pale
and
thin
,
but
his
eyes
were
quick
and
bright
*NL*
with
life
as
ever
.
He
watched
the
strange
,
almost
rhapsodic
way
in
which
*NL*
the
girl
moved
about
,
carrying
a
great
stew-jar
to
the
oven
,
or
looking
*NL*
in
the
saucepan
.
The
atmosphere
was
different
from
that
of
his
own
home
,
*NL*
where
everything
seemed
so
ordinary
.
When
Mr.
Leivers
called
loudly
*NL*
outside
to
the
horse
,
that
was
reaching
over
to
feed
on
the
rose-bushes
*NL*
in
the
garden
,
the
girl
started
,
looked
round
with
dark
eyes
,
as
if
*NL*
something
had
come
breaking
in
on
her
world
.
There
was
a
sense
of
*NL*
silence
inside
the
house
and
out
.
Miriam
seemed
as
in
some
dreamy
tale
,
*NL*
a
maiden
in
bondage
,
her
spirit
dreaming
in
a
land
far
away
and
magical
.
*NL*
And
her
discoloured
,
old
blue
frock
and
her
broken
boots
seemed
only
*NL*
like
the
romantic
rags
of
King
Cophetua
's
beggar-maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
suddenly
became
aware
of
his
keen
blue
eyes
upon
her
,
taking
her
all
*NL*
in
.
Instantly
her
broken
boots
and
her
frayed
old
frock
hurt
her
.
She
*NL*
resented
his
seeing
everything
.
Even
he
knew
that
her
stocking
was
not
*NL*
pulled
up
.
She
went
into
the
scullery
,
blushing
deeply
.
And
afterwards
*NL*
her
hands
trembled
slightly
at
her
work
.
She
nearly
dropped
all
she
*NL*
handled
.
When
her
inside
dream
was
shaken
,
her
body
quivered
with
*NL*
trepidation
.
She
resented
that
he
saw
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Leivers
sat
for
some
time
talking
to
the
boy
,
although
she
was
*NL*
needed
at
her
work
.
She
was
too
polite
to
leave
him
.
Presently
she
*NL*
excused
herself
and
rose
.
After
a
while
she
looked
into
the
tin
*NL*
saucepan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
DEAR
,
Miriam
,
''
she
cried
,
``
these
potatoes
have
boiled
dry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
started
as
if
she
had
been
stung
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
HAVE
they
,
mother
?
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
care
,
Miriam
,
''
said
the
mother
,
``
if
I
had
n't
trusted
them
*NL*
to
you
.
''
She
peered
into
the
pan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
stiffened
as
if
from
a
blow
.
Her
dark
eyes
dilated
;
she
*NL*
remained
standing
in
the
same
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
answered
,
gripped
tight
in
self-conscious
shame
,
``
I
'm
sure
I
*NL*
looked
at
them
five
minutes
since
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
mother
,
``
I
know
it
's
easily
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
not
much
burned
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
It
does
n't
matter
,
does
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Leivers
looked
at
the
youth
with
her
brown
,
hurt
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
n't
matter
but
for
the
boys
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
``
Only
Miriam
*NL*
knows
what
a
trouble
they
make
if
the
potatoes
are
`
caught
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
thought
Paul
to
himself
,
``
you
should
n't
let
them
make
a
*NL*
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
Edgar
came
in
.
He
wore
leggings
,
and
his
boots
were
*NL*
covered
with
earth
.
He
was
rather
small
,
rather
formal
,
for
a
farmer
.
He
*NL*
glanced
at
Paul
,
nodded
to
him
distantly
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dinner
ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
,
Edgar
,
''
replied
the
mother
apologetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
ready
for
mine
,
''
said
the
young
man
,
taking
up
the
newspaper
and
*NL*
reading
.
Presently
the
rest
of
the
family
trooped
in
.
Dinner
was
served
.
*NL*
The
meal
went
rather
brutally
.
The
over-gentleness
and
apologetic
tone
*NL*
of
the
mother
brought
out
all
the
brutality
of
manners
in
the
sons
.
*NL*
Edgar
tasted
the
potatoes
,
moved
his
mouth
quickly
like
a
rabbit
,
looked
*NL*
indignantly
at
his
mother
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
potatoes
are
burnt
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Edgar
.
I
forgot
them
for
a
minute
.
Perhaps
you
'll
have
bread
if
*NL*
you
ca
n't
eat
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edgar
looked
in
anger
across
at
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
Miriam
doing
that
she
could
n't
attend
to
them
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
looked
up
.
Her
mouth
opened
,
her
dark
eyes
blazed
and
winced
,
but
*NL*
she
said
nothing
.
She
swallowed
her
anger
and
her
shame
,
bowing
her
dark
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
she
was
trying
hard
,
''
said
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
n't
got
sense
even
to
boil
the
potatoes
,
''
said
Edgar
.
``
What
is
*NL*
she
kept
at
home
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
'
y
for
eating
everything
that
's
left
in
th
'
pantry
,
''
said
Maurice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
forget
that
potato-pie
against
our
Miriam
,
''
laughed
the
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
utterly
humiliated
.
The
mother
sat
in
silence
,
suffering
,
like
*NL*
some
saint
out
of
place
at
the
brutal
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
puzzled
Paul
.
He
wondered
vaguely
why
all
this
intense
feeling
*NL*
went
running
because
of
a
few
burnt
potatoes
.
The
mother
exalted
*NL*
everything
--
even
a
bit
of
housework
--
to
the
plane
of
a
religious
trust
.
*NL*
The
sons
resented
this
;
they
felt
themselves
cut
away
underneath
,
and
*NL*
they
answered
with
brutality
and
also
with
a
sneering
superciliousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
just
opening
out
from
childhood
into
manhood
.
This
atmosphere
,
*NL*
where
everything
took
a
religious
value
,
came
with
a
subtle
fascination
*NL*
to
him
.
There
was
something
in
the
air
.
His
own
mother
was
logical
.
Here
*NL*
there
was
something
different
,
something
he
loved
,
something
that
at
*NL*
times
he
hated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
quarrelled
with
her
brothers
fiercely
.
Later
in
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
when
they
had
gone
away
again
,
her
mother
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
disappointed
me
at
dinner-time
,
Miriam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
dropped
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
such
BRUTES
!
''
she
suddenly
cried
,
looking
up
with
flashing
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
had
n't
you
promised
not
to
answer
them
?
''
said
the
mother
.
``
And
I
*NL*
believed
in
you
.
I
CA
N'T
stand
it
when
you
wrangle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
're
so
hateful
!
''
cried
Miriam
,
``
and
--
and
LOW
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
.
But
how
often
have
I
asked
you
not
to
answer
Edgar
back
?
*NL*
Ca
n't
you
let
him
say
what
he
likes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
he
say
what
he
likes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
strong
enough
to
bear
it
,
Miriam
,
if
even
for
my
sake
?
Are
*NL*
you
so
weak
that
you
must
wrangle
with
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Leivers
stuck
unflinchingly
to
this
doctrine
of
``
the
other
cheek
''
.
*NL*
She
could
not
instil
it
at
all
into
the
boys
.
With
the
girls
she
*NL*
succeeded
better
,
and
Miriam
was
the
child
of
her
heart
.
The
boys
*NL*
loathed
the
other
cheek
when
it
was
presented
to
them
.
Miriam
was
often
*NL*
sufficiently
lofty
to
turn
it
.
Then
they
spat
on
her
and
hated
her
.
But
*NL*
she
walked
in
her
proud
humility
,
living
within
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
always
this
feeling
of
jangle
and
discord
in
the
Leivers
*NL*
family
.
Although
the
boys
resented
so
bitterly
this
eternal
appeal
to
*NL*
their
deeper
feelings
of
resignation
and
proud
humility
,
yet
it
had
*NL*
its
effect
on
them
.
They
could
not
establish
between
themselves
and
an
*NL*
outsider
just
the
ordinary
human
feeling
and
unexaggerated
friendship
;
*NL*
they
were
always
restless
for
the
something
deeper
.
Ordinary
folk
*NL*
seemed
shallow
to
them
,
trivial
and
inconsiderable
.
And
so
they
were
*NL*
unaccustomed
,
painfully
uncouth
in
the
simplest
social
intercourse
,
*NL*
suffering
,
and
yet
insolent
in
their
superiority
.
Then
beneath
was
the
*NL*
yearning
for
the
soul-intimacy
to
which
they
could
not
attain
because
*NL*
they
were
too
dumb
,
and
every
approach
to
close
connection
was
blocked
*NL*
by
their
clumsy
contempt
of
other
people
.
They
wanted
genuine
intimacy
,
*NL*
but
they
could
not
get
even
normally
near
to
anyone
,
because
they
*NL*
scorned
to
take
the
first
steps
,
they
scorned
the
triviality
which
forms
*NL*
common
human
intercourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
fell
under
Mrs.
Leivers
's
spell
.
Everything
had
a
religious
*NL*
and
intensified
meaning
when
he
was
with
her
.
His
soul
,
hurt
,
highly
*NL*
developed
,
sought
her
as
if
for
nourishment
.
Together
they
seemed
to
*NL*
sift
the
vital
fact
from
an
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
was
her
mother
's
daughter
.
In
the
sunshine
of
the
afternoon
*NL*
mother
and
daughter
went
down
the
fields
with
him
.
They
looked
for
*NL*
nests
.
There
was
a
jenny
wren
's
in
the
hedge
by
the
orchard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
DO
want
you
to
see
this
,
''
said
Mrs.
Leivers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crouched
down
and
carefully
put
his
finger
through
the
thorns
into
*NL*
the
round
door
of
the
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
almost
as
if
you
were
feeling
inside
the
live
body
of
the
bird
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
it
's
so
warm
.
They
say
a
bird
makes
its
nest
round
like
a
cup
*NL*
with
pressing
its
breast
on
it
.
Then
how
did
it
make
the
ceiling
round
,
*NL*
I
wonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nest
seemed
to
start
into
life
for
the
two
women
.
After
that
,
Miriam
*NL*
came
to
see
it
every
day
.
It
seemed
so
close
to
her
.
Again
,
going
*NL*
down
the
hedgeside
with
the
girl
,
he
noticed
the
celandines
,
scalloped
*NL*
splashes
of
gold
,
on
the
side
of
the
ditch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
them
,
''
he
said
,
``
when
their
petals
go
flat
back
with
the
*NL*
sunshine
.
They
seemed
to
be
pressing
themselves
at
the
sun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
celandines
ever
after
drew
her
with
a
little
spell
.
*NL*
Anthropomorphic
as
she
was
,
she
stimulated
him
into
appreciating
things
*NL*
thus
,
and
then
they
lived
for
her
.
She
seemed
to
need
things
kindling
in
*NL*
her
imagination
or
in
her
soul
before
she
felt
she
had
them
.
And
she
*NL*
was
cut
off
from
ordinary
life
by
her
religious
intensity
which
made
*NL*
the
world
for
her
either
a
nunnery
garden
or
a
paradise
,
where
sin
and
*NL*
knowledge
were
not
,
or
else
an
ugly
,
cruel
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
in
this
atmosphere
of
subtle
intimacy
,
this
meeting
in
their
*NL*
common
feeling
for
something
in
Nature
,
that
their
love
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
Personally
,
he
was
a
long
time
before
he
realized
her
.
For
ten
months
he
*NL*
had
to
stay
at
home
after
his
illness
.
For
a
while
he
went
to
Skegness
*NL*
with
his
mother
,
and
was
perfectly
happy
.
But
even
from
the
seaside
he
*NL*
wrote
long
letters
to
Mrs.
Leivers
about
the
shore
and
the
sea
.
And
he
*NL*
brought
back
his
beloved
sketches
of
the
flat
Lincoln
coast
,
anxious
*NL*
for
them
to
see
.
Almost
they
would
interest
the
Leivers
more
than
they
*NL*
interested
his
mother
.
It
was
not
his
art
Mrs.
Morel
cared
about
;
it
*NL*
was
himself
and
his
achievement
.
But
Mrs.
Leivers
and
her
children
were
*NL*
almost
his
disciples
.
They
kindled
him
and
made
him
glow
to
his
work
,
*NL*
whereas
his
mother
's
influence
was
to
make
him
quietly
determined
,
*NL*
patient
,
dogged
,
unwearied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
was
friends
with
the
boys
,
whose
rudeness
was
only
superficial
.
*NL*
They
had
all
,
when
they
could
trust
themselves
,
a
strange
gentleness
and
*NL*
lovableness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
come
with
me
on
to
the
fallow
?
''
asked
Edgar
,
rather
*NL*
hesitatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
joyfully
,
and
spent
the
afternoon
helping
to
hoe
or
to
single
*NL*
turnips
with
his
friend
.
He
used
to
lie
with
the
three
brothers
in
*NL*
the
hay
piled
up
in
the
barn
and
tell
them
about
Nottingham
and
about
*NL*
Jordan
's
.
In
return
,
they
taught
him
to
milk
,
and
let
him
do
little
*NL*
jobs
--
chopping
hay
or
pulping
turnips
--
just
as
much
as
he
liked
.
At
*NL*
midsummer
he
worked
all
through
hay-harvest
with
them
,
and
then
he
loved
*NL*
them
.
The
family
was
so
cut
off
from
the
world
actually
.
They
seemed
,
*NL*
somehow
,
like
''
_
les
derniers
fils
d'une
race
epuisee
_
''
.
Though
the
lads
*NL*
were
strong
and
healthy
,
yet
they
had
all
that
over-sensitiveness
and
*NL*
hanging-back
which
made
them
so
lonely
,
yet
also
such
close
,
delicate
*NL*
friends
once
their
intimacy
was
won
.
Paul
loved
them
dearly
,
and
they
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
came
later
.
But
he
had
come
into
her
life
before
she
made
any
*NL*
mark
on
his
.
One
dull
afternoon
,
when
the
men
were
on
the
land
and
the
*NL*
rest
at
school
,
only
Miriam
and
her
mother
at
home
,
the
girl
said
to
*NL*
him
,
after
having
hesitated
for
some
time
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
the
swing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
.
``
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
cowshed
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
always
hesitated
to
offer
or
to
show
him
anything
.
Men
have
such
*NL*
different
standards
of
worth
from
women
,
and
her
dear
things
--
the
*NL*
valuable
things
to
her
--
her
brothers
had
so
often
mocked
or
flouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
then
,
''
he
replied
,
jumping
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
two
cowsheds
,
one
on
either
side
of
the
barn
.
In
the
lower
,
*NL*
darker
shed
there
was
standing
for
four
cows
.
Hens
flew
scolding
over
*NL*
the
manger-wall
as
the
youth
and
girl
went
forward
for
the
great
thick
*NL*
rope
which
hung
from
the
beam
in
the
darkness
overhead
,
and
was
pushed
*NL*
back
over
a
peg
in
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
something
like
a
rope
!
''
he
exclaimed
appreciatively
;
and
he
sat
*NL*
down
on
it
,
anxious
to
try
it
.
Then
immediately
he
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
then
,
and
have
first
go
,
''
he
said
to
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
she
answered
,
going
into
the
barn
,
``
we
put
some
bags
on
the
*NL*
seat
''
;
and
she
made
the
swing
comfortable
for
him
.
That
gave
her
*NL*
pleasure
.
He
held
the
rope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
then
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
go
first
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
aside
in
her
still
,
aloof
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
,
''
she
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
the
pleasure
of
giving
up
*NL*
to
a
man
,
of
spoiling
him
.
Paul
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
said
,
sitting
down
.
``
Mind
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
off
with
a
spring
,
and
in
a
moment
was
flying
through
the
air
,
*NL*
almost
out
of
the
door
of
the
shed
,
the
upper
half
of
which
was
open
,
*NL*
showing
outside
the
drizzling
rain
,
the
filthy
yard
,
the
cattle
standing
*NL*
disconsolate
against
the
black
cartshed
,
and
at
the
back
of
all
*NL*
the
grey-green
wall
of
the
wood
.
She
stood
below
in
her
crimson
*NL*
tam-o
'
-
shanter
and
watched
.
He
looked
down
at
her
,
and
she
saw
his
blue
*NL*
eyes
sparkling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
treat
of
a
swing
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
swinging
through
the
air
,
every
bit
of
him
swinging
,
like
a
bird
*NL*
that
swoops
for
joy
of
movement
.
And
he
looked
down
at
her
.
Her
crimson
*NL*
cap
hung
over
her
dark
curls
,
her
beautiful
warm
face
,
so
still
in
a
*NL*
kind
of
brooding
,
was
lifted
towards
him
.
It
was
dark
and
rather
cold
in
*NL*
the
shed
.
Suddenly
a
swallow
came
down
from
the
high
roof
and
darted
out
*NL*
of
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
a
bird
was
watching
,
''
he
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
swung
negligently
.
She
could
feel
him
falling
and
lifting
through
the
*NL*
air
,
as
if
he
were
lying
on
some
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
'll
die
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
detached
,
dreamy
voice
,
as
though
he
were
*NL*
the
dying
motion
of
the
swing
.
She
watched
him
,
fascinated
.
Suddenly
he
*NL*
put
on
the
brake
and
jumped
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
a
long
turn
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
it
's
a
treat
of
a
swing
--
it
's
a
*NL*
real
treat
of
a
swing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
was
amused
that
he
took
a
swing
so
seriously
and
felt
so
warmly
*NL*
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
you
go
on
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
n't
you
want
one
?
''
he
asked
,
astonished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
not
much
.
I
'll
have
just
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
,
whilst
he
kept
the
bags
in
place
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
ripping
!
''
he
said
,
setting
her
in
motion
.
``
Keep
your
heels
up
,
*NL*
or
they
'll
bang
the
manger
wall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
the
accuracy
with
which
he
caught
her
,
exactly
at
the
right
*NL*
moment
,
and
the
exactly
proportionate
strength
of
his
thrust
,
and
she
*NL*
was
afraid
.
Down
to
her
bowels
went
the
hot
wave
of
fear
.
She
was
in
his
*NL*
hands
.
Again
,
firm
and
inevitable
came
the
thrust
at
the
right
moment
.
*NL*
She
gripped
the
rope
,
almost
swooning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
she
laughed
in
fear
.
``
No
higher
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
're
not
a
BIT
high
,
''
he
remonstrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
higher
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
fear
in
her
voice
,
and
desisted
.
Her
heart
melted
in
hot
*NL*
pain
when
the
moment
came
for
him
to
thrust
her
forward
again
.
But
he
*NL*
left
her
alone
.
She
began
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
really
go
any
farther
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Should
I
keep
you
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
let
me
go
by
myself
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
aside
and
watched
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
're
scarcely
moving
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
slightly
with
shame
,
and
in
a
moment
got
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
if
you
can
swing
you
wo
n't
be
sea-sick
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
*NL*
mounted
again
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
I
should
ever
be
sea-sick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Away
he
went
.
There
was
something
fascinating
to
her
in
him
.
For
the
*NL*
moment
he
was
nothing
but
a
piece
of
swinging
stuff
;
not
a
particle
of
*NL*
him
that
did
not
swing
.
She
could
never
lose
herself
so
,
nor
could
her
*NL*
brothers
.
It
roused
a
warmth
in
her
.
It
was
almost
as
if
he
were
a
flame
*NL*
that
had
lit
a
warmth
in
her
whilst
he
swung
in
the
middle
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
gradually
the
intimacy
with
the
family
concentrated
for
Paul
on
*NL*
three
persons
--
the
mother
,
Edgar
,
and
Miriam
.
To
the
mother
he
went
for
*NL*
that
sympathy
and
that
appeal
which
seemed
to
draw
him
out
.
Edgar
was
*NL*
his
very
close
friend
.
And
to
Miriam
he
more
or
less
condescended
,
*NL*
because
she
seemed
so
humble
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
girl
gradually
sought
him
out
.
If
he
brought
up
his
sketch-book
,
*NL*
it
was
she
who
pondered
longest
over
the
last
picture
.
Then
she
would
*NL*
look
up
at
him
.
Suddenly
,
her
dark
eyes
alight
like
water
that
shakes
*NL*
with
a
stream
of
gold
in
the
dark
,
she
would
ask
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
I
like
this
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Always
something
in
his
breast
shrank
from
these
close
,
intimate
,
*NL*
dazzled
looks
of
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
DO
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
It
seems
so
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
because
--
it
's
because
there
is
scarcely
any
shadow
in
it
;
it
's
*NL*
more
shimmery
,
as
if
I
'd
painted
the
shimmering
protoplasm
in
the
leaves
*NL*
and
everywhere
,
and
not
the
stiffness
of
the
shape
.
That
seems
dead
*NL*
to
me
.
Only
this
shimmeriness
is
the
real
living
.
The
shape
is
a
dead
*NL*
crust
.
The
shimmer
is
inside
really
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
,
with
her
little
finger
in
her
mouth
,
would
ponder
these
*NL*
sayings
.
They
gave
her
a
feeling
of
life
again
,
and
vivified
things
*NL*
which
had
meant
nothing
to
her
.
She
managed
to
find
some
meaning
in
his
*NL*
struggling
,
abstract
speeches
.
And
they
were
the
medium
through
which
*NL*
she
came
distinctly
at
her
beloved
objects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
day
she
sat
at
sunset
whilst
he
was
painting
some
pine-trees
*NL*
which
caught
the
red
glare
from
the
west
.
He
had
been
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
are
!
''
he
said
suddenly
.
``
I
wanted
that
.
Now
,
look
at
them
and
*NL*
tell
me
,
are
they
pine
trunks
or
are
they
red
coals
,
standing-up
pieces
*NL*
of
fire
in
that
darkness
?
There
's
God
's
burning
bush
for
you
,
that
*NL*
burned
not
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
looked
,
and
was
frightened
.
But
the
pine
trunks
were
wonderful
*NL*
to
her
,
and
distinct
.
He
packed
his
box
and
rose
.
Suddenly
he
looked
at
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
always
sad
?
''
he
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sad
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
looking
up
at
him
with
startled
,
wonderful
brown
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
.
``
You
are
always
sad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
--
oh
,
not
a
bit
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
even
your
joy
is
like
a
flame
coming
off
of
sadness
,
''
he
persisted
.
*NL*
``
You
're
never
jolly
,
or
even
just
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
pondered
.
``
I
wonder
--
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
're
not
;
because
you
're
different
inside
,
like
a
pine-tree
,
*NL*
and
then
you
flare
up
;
but
you
're
not
just
like
an
ordinary
tree
,
with
*NL*
fidgety
leaves
and
jolly
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
tangled
up
in
his
own
speech
;
but
she
brooded
on
it
,
and
he
had
a
*NL*
strange
,
roused
sensation
,
as
if
his
feelings
were
new
.
She
got
so
near
*NL*
him
.
It
was
a
strange
stimulant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
sometimes
he
hated
her
.
Her
youngest
brother
was
only
five
.
He
was
*NL*
a
frail
lad
,
with
immense
brown
eyes
in
his
quaint
fragile
face
--
one
of
*NL*
Reynolds
's
``
Choir
of
Angels
''
,
with
a
touch
of
elf
.
Often
Miriam
kneeled
*NL*
to
the
child
and
drew
him
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
my
Hubert
!
''
she
sang
,
in
a
voice
heavy
and
surcharged
with
love
.
*NL*
``
Eh
,
my
Hubert
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
folding
him
in
her
arms
,
she
swayed
slightly
from
side
to
side
with
*NL*
love
,
her
face
half
lifted
,
her
eyes
half
closed
,
her
voice
drenched
*NL*
with
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
!
''
said
the
child
,
uneasy
--
``
do
n't
,
Miriam
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
love
me
,
do
n't
you
?
''
she
murmured
deep
in
her
throat
,
almost
*NL*
as
if
she
were
in
a
trance
,
and
swaying
also
as
if
she
were
swooned
in
*NL*
an
ecstasy
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
!
''
repeated
the
child
,
a
frown
on
his
clear
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
love
me
,
do
n't
you
?
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
make
such
a
FUSS
for
?
''
cried
Paul
,
all
in
suffering
because
*NL*
of
her
extreme
emotion
.
``
Why
ca
n't
you
be
ordinary
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
let
the
child
go
,
and
rose
,
and
said
nothing
.
Her
intensity
,
which
*NL*
would
leave
no
emotion
on
a
normal
plane
,
irritated
the
youth
into
*NL*
a
frenzy
.
And
this
fearful
,
naked
contact
of
her
on
small
occasions
*NL*
shocked
him
.
He
was
used
to
his
mother
's
reserve
.
And
on
such
occasions
*NL*
he
was
thankful
in
his
heart
and
soul
that
he
had
his
mother
,
so
sane
*NL*
and
wholesome
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
life
of
Miriam
's
body
was
in
her
eyes
,
which
were
usually
dark
*NL*
as
a
dark
church
,
but
could
flame
with
light
like
a
conflagration
.
Her
*NL*
face
scarcely
ever
altered
from
its
look
of
brooding
.
She
might
have
*NL*
been
one
of
the
women
who
went
with
Mary
when
Jesus
was
dead
.
Her
body
*NL*
was
not
flexible
and
living
.
She
walked
with
a
swing
,
rather
heavily
,
*NL*
her
head
bowed
forward
,
pondering
.
She
was
not
clumsy
,
and
yet
none
of
*NL*
her
movements
seemed
quite
THE
movement
.
Often
,
when
wiping
the
dishes
,
*NL*
she
would
stand
in
bewilderment
and
chagrin
because
she
had
pulled
*NL*
in
two
halves
a
cup
or
a
tumbler
.
It
was
as
if
,
in
her
fear
and
*NL*
self-mistrust
,
she
put
too
much
strength
into
the
effort
.
There
was
*NL*
no
looseness
or
abandon
about
her
.
Everything
was
gripped
stiff
with
*NL*
intensity
,
and
her
effort
,
overcharged
,
closed
in
on
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rarely
varied
from
her
swinging
,
forward
,
intense
walk
.
Occasionally
*NL*
she
ran
with
Paul
down
the
fields
.
Then
her
eyes
blazed
naked
in
a
kind
*NL*
of
ecstasy
that
frightened
him
.
But
she
was
physically
afraid
.
If
*NL*
she
were
getting
over
a
stile
,
she
gripped
his
hands
in
a
little
hard
*NL*
anguish
,
and
began
to
lose
her
presence
of
mind
.
And
he
could
not
*NL*
persuade
her
to
jump
from
even
a
small
height
.
Her
eyes
dilated
,
became
*NL*
exposed
and
palpitating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
she
cried
,
half
laughing
in
terror
--
``
no
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
!
''
he
cried
once
,
and
,
jerking
her
forward
,
he
brought
her
*NL*
falling
from
the
fence
.
But
her
wild
``
Ah
!
''
of
pain
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
losing
consciousness
,
cut
him
.
She
landed
on
her
feet
safely
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
had
courage
in
this
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
much
dissatisfied
with
her
lot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
like
being
at
home
?
''
Paul
asked
her
,
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
would
?
''
she
answered
,
low
and
intense
.
``
What
is
it
?
I
'm
all
day
*NL*
cleaning
what
the
boys
make
just
as
bad
in
five
minutes
.
I
do
n't
WANT
to
*NL*
be
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
do
something
.
I
want
a
chance
like
anybody
else
.
Why
should
*NL*
I
,
because
I
'm
a
girl
,
be
kept
at
home
and
not
allowed
to
be
anything
?
*NL*
What
chance
HAVE
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chance
of
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
knowing
anything
--
of
learning
,
of
doing
anything
.
It
's
not
fair
,
*NL*
because
I
'm
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
very
bitter
.
Paul
wondered
.
In
his
own
home
Annie
was
almost
*NL*
glad
to
be
a
girl
.
She
had
not
so
much
responsibility
;
things
were
*NL*
lighter
for
her
.
She
never
wanted
to
be
other
than
a
girl
.
But
Miriam
*NL*
almost
fiercely
wished
she
were
a
man
.
And
yet
she
hated
men
at
the
same
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
as
well
to
be
a
woman
as
a
man
,
''
he
said
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
Is
it
?
Men
have
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
women
ought
to
be
as
glad
to
be
women
as
men
are
to
be
*NL*
men
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
--
she
shook
her
head
--
``
no
!
Everything
the
men
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
you
want
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
learn
.
Why
SHOULD
it
be
that
I
know
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
such
as
mathematics
and
French
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
SHOULD
N'T
I
know
mathematics
?
Yes
!
''
she
cried
,
her
eye
expanding
in
*NL*
a
kind
of
defiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
learn
as
much
as
I
know
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
teach
you
,
if
*NL*
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
dilated
.
She
mistrusted
him
as
teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
head
had
dropped
,
and
she
was
sucking
her
finger
broodingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
hesitatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
used
to
tell
his
mother
all
these
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
teach
Miriam
algebra
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
I
hope
she
'll
get
fat
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
went
up
to
the
farm
on
the
Monday
evening
,
it
was
drawing
*NL*
twilight
.
Miriam
was
just
sweeping
up
the
kitchen
,
and
was
kneeling
at
*NL*
the
hearth
when
he
entered
.
Everyone
was
out
but
her
.
She
looked
round
*NL*
at
him
,
flushed
,
her
dark
eyes
shining
,
her
fine
hair
falling
about
her
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
she
said
,
soft
and
musical
.
``
I
knew
it
was
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
your
step
.
Nobody
treads
so
quick
and
firm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
,
sighing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
to
do
some
algebra
?
''
he
asked
,
drawing
a
little
book
from
his
*NL*
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
feel
her
backing
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
you
wanted
,
''
he
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-night
,
though
?
''
she
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
came
on
purpose
.
And
if
you
want
to
learn
it
,
you
must
begin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
up
her
ashes
in
the
dustpan
and
looked
at
him
,
half
*NL*
tremulously
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
to-night
!
You
see
,
I
have
n't
thought
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
goodness
!
Take
the
ashes
and
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
and
sat
on
the
stone
bench
in
the
back-yard
,
where
the
big
*NL*
milk-cans
were
standing
,
tipped
up
,
to
air
.
The
men
were
in
the
*NL*
cowsheds
.
He
could
hear
the
little
sing-song
of
the
milk
spurting
into
*NL*
the
pails
.
Presently
she
came
,
bringing
some
big
greenish
apples
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
you
like
them
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
bite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
he
said
,
with
his
mouth
full
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
short-sighted
,
and
peered
over
his
shoulder
.
It
irritated
him
.
*NL*
He
gave
her
the
book
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
only
letters
for
figures
.
You
put
down
`
a
'
*NL*
instead
of
'
2
'
or
'
6
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
worked
,
he
talking
,
she
with
her
head
down
on
the
book
.
He
was
*NL*
quick
and
hasty
.
She
never
answered
.
Occasionally
,
when
he
demanded
*NL*
of
her
,
``
Do
you
see
?
''
she
looked
up
at
him
,
her
eyes
wide
with
the
*NL*
half-laugh
that
comes
of
fear
.
``
Do
n't
you
?
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
too
fast
.
But
she
said
nothing
.
He
questioned
her
more
,
then
*NL*
got
hot
.
It
made
his
blood
rouse
to
see
her
there
,
as
it
were
,
at
his
*NL*
mercy
,
her
mouth
open
,
her
eyes
dilated
with
laughter
that
was
afraid
,
*NL*
apologetic
,
ashamed
.
Then
Edgar
came
along
with
two
buckets
of
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
he
said
.
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Algebra
,
''
replied
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Algebra
!
''
repeated
Edgar
curiously
.
Then
he
passed
on
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
Paul
took
a
bite
at
his
forgotten
apple
,
looked
at
the
miserable
*NL*
cabbages
in
the
garden
,
pecked
into
lace
by
the
fowls
,
and
he
wanted
to
*NL*
pull
them
up
.
Then
he
glanced
at
Miriam
.
She
was
poring
over
the
book
,
*NL*
seemed
absorbed
in
it
,
yet
trembling
lest
she
could
not
get
at
it
.
It
*NL*
made
him
cross
.
She
was
ruddy
and
beautiful
.
Yet
her
soul
seemed
to
be
*NL*
intensely
supplicating
.
The
algebra-book
she
closed
,
shrinking
,
knowing
*NL*
he
was
angered
;
and
at
the
same
instant
he
grew
gentle
,
seeing
her
hurt
*NL*
because
she
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
things
came
slowly
to
her
.
And
when
she
held
herself
in
a
grip
,
*NL*
seemed
so
utterly
humble
before
the
lesson
,
it
made
his
blood
rouse
.
*NL*
He
stormed
at
her
,
got
ashamed
,
continued
the
lesson
,
and
grew
furious
*NL*
again
,
abusing
her
.
She
listened
in
silence
.
Occasionally
,
very
rarely
,
*NL*
she
defended
herself
.
Her
liquid
dark
eyes
blazed
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
give
me
time
to
learn
it
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
answered
,
throwing
the
book
on
the
table
and
lighting
*NL*
a
cigarette
.
Then
,
after
a
while
,
he
went
back
to
her
repentant
.
So
the
*NL*
lessons
went
.
He
was
always
either
in
a
rage
or
very
gentle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
tremble
your
SOUL
before
it
for
?
''
he
cried
.
``
You
do
n't
*NL*
learn
algebra
with
your
blessed
soul
.
Ca
n't
you
look
at
it
with
your
*NL*
clear
simple
wits
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
when
he
went
again
into
the
kitchen
,
Mrs.
Leivers
would
look
at
*NL*
him
reproachfully
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
,
do
n't
be
so
hard
on
Miriam
.
She
may
not
be
quick
,
but
I
'm
sure
*NL*
she
tries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
,
''
he
said
rather
pitiably
.
``
I
go
off
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mind
me
,
Miriam
,
do
you
?
''
he
asked
of
the
girl
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
reassured
him
in
her
beautiful
deep
tones
--
``
no
,
I
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
me
;
it
's
my
fault
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
his
blood
began
to
boil
with
her
.
It
was
*NL*
strange
that
no
one
else
made
him
in
such
fury
.
He
flared
against
her
.
*NL*
Once
he
threw
the
pencil
in
her
face
.
There
was
a
silence
.
She
turned
*NL*
her
face
slightly
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
--
''
he
began
,
but
got
no
farther
,
feeling
weak
in
all
his
*NL*
bones
.
She
never
reproached
him
or
was
angry
with
him
.
He
was
often
*NL*
cruelly
ashamed
.
But
still
again
his
anger
burst
like
a
bubble
*NL*
surcharged
;
and
still
,
when
he
saw
her
eager
,
silent
,
as
it
were
,
blind
*NL*
face
,
he
felt
he
wanted
to
throw
the
pencil
in
it
;
and
still
,
when
he
*NL*
saw
her
hand
trembling
and
her
mouth
parted
with
suffering
,
his
heart
*NL*
was
scalded
with
pain
for
her
.
And
because
of
the
intensity
to
which
she
*NL*
roused
him
,
he
sought
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
often
avoided
her
and
went
with
Edgar
.
Miriam
and
her
brother
*NL*
were
naturally
antagonistic
.
Edgar
was
a
rationalist
,
who
was
curious
,
*NL*
and
had
a
sort
of
scientific
interest
in
life
.
It
was
a
great
bitterness
*NL*
to
Miriam
to
see
herself
deserted
by
Paul
for
Edgar
,
who
seemed
so
much
*NL*
lower
.
But
the
youth
was
very
happy
with
her
elder
brother
.
The
two
men
*NL*
spent
afternoons
together
on
the
land
or
in
the
loft
doing
carpentry
,
*NL*
when
it
rained
.
And
they
talked
together
,
or
Paul
taught
Edgar
the
songs
*NL*
he
himself
had
learned
from
Annie
at
the
piano
.
And
often
all
the
men
,
*NL*
Mr.
Leivers
as
well
,
had
bitter
debates
on
the
nationalizing
of
the
land
*NL*
and
similar
problems
.
Paul
had
already
heard
his
mother
's
views
,
and
as
*NL*
these
were
as
yet
his
own
,
he
argued
for
her
.
Miriam
attended
and
*NL*
took
part
,
but
was
all
the
time
waiting
until
it
should
be
over
and
a
*NL*
personal
communication
might
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
''
she
said
within
herself
,
``
if
the
land
were
nationalized
,
*NL*
Edgar
and
Paul
and
I
would
be
just
the
same
.
''
So
she
waited
for
the
*NL*
youth
to
come
back
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
studying
for
his
painting
.
He
loved
to
sit
at
home
,
alone
with
*NL*
his
mother
,
at
night
,
working
and
working
.
She
sewed
or
read
.
Then
,
*NL*
looking
up
from
his
task
,
he
would
rest
his
eyes
for
a
moment
on
her
*NL*
face
,
that
was
bright
with
living
warmth
,
and
he
returned
gladly
to
his
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
do
my
best
things
when
you
sit
there
in
your
rocking-chair
,
*NL*
mother
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
sniffing
with
mock
scepticism
.
But
she
felt
*NL*
it
was
so
,
and
her
heart
quivered
with
brightness
.
For
many
hours
she
*NL*
sat
still
,
slightly
conscious
of
him
labouring
away
,
whilst
she
worked
*NL*
or
read
her
book
.
And
he
,
with
all
his
soul
's
intensity
directing
his
*NL*
pencil
,
could
feel
her
warmth
inside
him
like
strength
.
They
were
both
*NL*
very
happy
so
,
and
both
unconscious
of
it
.
These
times
,
that
meant
so
*NL*
much
,
and
which
were
real
living
,
they
almost
ignored
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
conscious
only
when
stimulated
.
A
sketch
finished
,
he
always
*NL*
wanted
to
take
it
to
Miriam
.
Then
he
was
stimulated
into
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
work
he
had
produced
unconsciously
.
In
contact
with
Miriam
he
*NL*
gained
insight
;
his
vision
went
deeper
.
From
his
mother
he
drew
the
*NL*
life-warmth
,
the
strength
to
produce
;
Miriam
urged
this
warmth
into
*NL*
intensity
like
a
white
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
returned
to
the
factory
the
conditions
of
work
were
better
.
*NL*
He
had
Wednesday
afternoon
off
to
go
to
the
Art
School
--
Miss
Jordan
's
*NL*
provision
--
returning
in
the
evening
.
Then
the
factory
closed
at
six
*NL*
instead
of
eight
on
Thursday
and
Friday
evenings
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
in
the
summer
Miriam
and
he
went
over
the
fields
by
Herod
's
*NL*
Farm
on
their
way
from
the
library
home
.
So
it
was
only
three
miles
*NL*
to
Willey
Farm
.
There
was
a
yellow
glow
over
the
mowing-grass
,
and
the
*NL*
sorrel-heads
burned
crimson
.
Gradually
,
as
they
walked
along
the
high
*NL*
land
,
the
gold
in
the
west
sank
down
to
red
,
the
red
to
crimson
,
and
*NL*
then
the
chill
blue
crept
up
against
the
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
out
upon
the
high
road
to
Alfreton
,
which
ran
white
between
*NL*
the
darkening
fields
.
There
Paul
hesitated
.
It
was
two
miles
home
for
*NL*
him
,
one
mile
forward
for
Miriam
.
They
both
looked
up
the
road
that
ran
*NL*
in
shadow
right
under
the
glow
of
the
north-west
sky
.
On
the
crest
of
*NL*
the
hill
,
Selby
,
with
its
stark
houses
and
the
up-pricked
headstocks
of
*NL*
the
pit
,
stood
in
black
silhouette
small
against
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nine
o'clock
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pair
stood
,
loth
to
part
,
hugging
their
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wood
is
so
lovely
now
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
wanted
you
to
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
her
slowly
across
the
road
to
the
white
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
grumble
so
if
I
'm
late
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
're
not
doing
anything
wrong
,
''
she
answered
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
her
across
the
nibbled
pasture
in
the
dusk
.
There
was
a
*NL*
coolness
in
the
wood
,
a
scent
of
leaves
,
of
honeysuckle
,
and
a
twilight
.
*NL*
The
two
walked
in
silence
.
Night
came
wonderfully
there
,
among
the
*NL*
throng
of
dark
tree-trunks
.
He
looked
round
,
expectant
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
show
him
a
certain
wild-rose
bush
she
had
discovered
.
She
*NL*
knew
it
was
wonderful
.
And
yet
,
till
he
had
seen
it
,
she
felt
it
had
*NL*
not
come
into
her
soul
.
Only
he
could
make
it
her
own
,
immortal
.
She
was
*NL*
dissatisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dew
was
already
on
the
paths
.
In
the
old
oak-wood
a
mist
was
rising
,
and
*NL*
he
hesitated
,
wondering
whether
one
whiteness
were
a
strand
of
fog
or
*NL*
only
campion-flowers
pallid
in
a
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
they
came
to
the
pine-trees
Miriam
was
getting
very
eager
*NL*
and
very
tense
.
Her
bush
might
be
gone
.
She
might
not
be
able
to
find
*NL*
it
;
and
she
wanted
it
so
much
.
Almost
passionately
she
wanted
to
be
*NL*
with
him
when
he
stood
before
the
flowers
.
They
were
going
to
have
a
*NL*
communion
together
--
something
that
thrilled
her
,
something
holy
.
He
was
*NL*
walking
beside
her
in
silence
.
They
were
very
near
to
each
other
.
She
*NL*
trembled
,
and
he
listened
,
vaguely
anxious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coming
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
they
saw
the
sky
in
front
,
like
*NL*
mother-of-pearl
,
and
the
earth
growing
dark
.
Somewhere
on
the
outermost
*NL*
branches
of
the
pine-wood
the
honeysuckle
was
streaming
scent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
the
middle
path
,
''
she
murmured
,
quivering
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
path
she
stood
still
.
In
the
wide
*NL*
walk
between
the
pines
,
gazing
rather
frightened
,
she
could
distinguish
*NL*
nothing
for
some
moments
;
the
greying
light
robbed
things
of
their
*NL*
colour
.
Then
she
saw
her
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
cried
,
hastening
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
still
.
The
tree
was
tall
and
straggling
.
It
had
thrown
its
*NL*
briers
over
a
hawthorn-bush
,
and
its
long
streamers
trailed
thick
,
right
*NL*
down
to
the
grass
,
splashing
the
darkness
everywhere
with
great
spilt
*NL*
stars
,
pure
white
.
In
bosses
of
ivory
and
in
large
splashed
stars
the
*NL*
roses
gleamed
on
the
darkness
of
foliage
and
stems
and
grass
.
Paul
and
*NL*
Miriam
stood
close
together
,
silent
,
and
watched
.
Point
after
point
the
*NL*
steady
roses
shone
out
to
them
,
seeming
to
kindle
something
in
their
*NL*
souls
.
The
dusk
came
like
smoke
around
,
and
still
did
not
put
out
the
*NL*
roses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
looked
into
Miriam
's
eyes
.
She
was
pale
and
expectant
with
wonder
,
*NL*
her
lips
were
parted
,
and
her
dark
eyes
lay
open
to
him
.
His
look
seemed
*NL*
to
travel
down
into
her
.
Her
soul
quivered
.
It
was
the
communion
she
*NL*
wanted
.
He
turned
aside
,
as
if
pained
.
He
turned
to
the
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
seem
as
if
they
walk
like
butterflies
,
and
shake
themselves
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
her
roses
.
They
were
white
,
some
incurved
and
holy
,
others
*NL*
expanded
in
an
ecstasy
.
The
tree
was
dark
as
a
shadow
.
She
lifted
her
*NL*
hand
impulsively
to
the
flowers
;
she
went
forward
and
touched
them
in
*NL*
worship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
cool
scent
of
ivory
roses
--
a
white
,
virgin
scent
.
Something
*NL*
made
him
feel
anxious
and
imprisoned
.
The
two
walked
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
Sunday
,
''
he
said
quietly
,
and
left
her
;
and
she
walked
home
*NL*
slowly
,
feeling
her
soul
satisfied
with
the
holiness
of
the
night
.
He
*NL*
stumbled
down
the
path
.
And
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
wood
,
in
the
*NL*
free
open
meadow
,
where
he
could
breathe
,
he
started
to
run
as
fast
as
*NL*
he
could
.
It
was
like
a
delicious
delirium
in
his
veins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Always
when
he
went
with
Miriam
,
and
it
grew
rather
late
,
he
knew
his
*NL*
mother
was
fretting
and
getting
angry
about
him
--
why
,
he
could
not
*NL*
understand
.
As
he
went
into
the
house
,
flinging
down
his
cap
,
his
mother
*NL*
looked
up
at
the
clock
.
She
had
been
sitting
thinking
,
because
a
chill
*NL*
to
her
eyes
prevented
her
reading
.
She
could
feel
Paul
being
drawn
away
*NL*
by
this
girl
.
And
she
did
not
care
for
Miriam
.
``
She
is
one
of
those
who
*NL*
will
want
to
suck
a
man
's
soul
out
till
he
has
none
of
his
own
left
,
''
*NL*
she
said
to
herself
;
``
and
he
is
just
such
a
gaby
as
to
let
himself
be
*NL*
absorbed
.
She
will
never
let
him
become
a
man
;
she
never
will
.
''
So
,
*NL*
while
he
was
away
with
Miriam
,
Mrs.
Morel
grew
more
and
more
worked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
at
the
clock
and
said
,
coldly
and
rather
tired
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
far
enough
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
soul
,
warm
and
exposed
from
contact
with
the
girl
,
shrank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
been
right
home
with
her
,
''
his
mother
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
not
answer
.
Mrs.
Morel
,
looking
at
him
quickly
,
saw
his
hair
*NL*
was
damp
on
his
forehead
with
haste
,
saw
him
frowning
in
his
heavy
*NL*
fashion
,
resentfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
be
wonderfully
fascinating
,
that
you
ca
n't
get
away
from
her
,
*NL*
but
must
go
trailing
eight
miles
at
this
time
of
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
hurt
between
the
past
glamour
with
Miriam
and
the
knowledge
*NL*
that
his
mother
fretted
.
He
had
meant
not
to
say
anything
,
to
refuse
to
*NL*
answer
.
But
he
could
not
harden
his
heart
to
ignore
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
DO
like
to
talk
to
her
,
''
he
answered
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
nobody
else
to
talk
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
say
anything
if
I
went
with
Edgar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
should
.
You
know
,
whoever
you
went
with
,
I
should
say
it
*NL*
was
too
far
for
you
to
go
trailing
,
late
at
night
,
when
you
've
been
*NL*
to
Nottingham
.
Besides
''
--
her
voice
suddenly
flashed
into
anger
and
*NL*
contempt
--
``
it
is
disgusting
--
bits
of
lads
and
girls
courting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
NOT
courting
,
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
else
you
call
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
!
Do
you
think
we
SPOON
and
do
?
We
only
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
goodness
knows
what
time
and
distance
,
''
was
the
sarcastic
*NL*
rejoinder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
snapped
at
the
laces
of
his
boots
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
so
mad
about
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Because
you
do
n't
like
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
say
I
do
n't
like
her
.
But
I
do
n't
hold
with
children
keeping
*NL*
company
,
and
never
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
n't
mind
our
Annie
going
out
with
Jim
Inger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
more
sense
than
you
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
Annie
's
not
one
of
the
deep
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
failed
to
see
the
meaning
of
this
remark
.
But
his
mother
looked
*NL*
tired
.
She
was
never
so
strong
after
William
's
death
;
and
her
eyes
hurt
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
's
so
pretty
in
the
country
.
Mr.
Sleath
asked
about
*NL*
you
.
He
said
he
'd
missed
you
.
Are
you
a
bit
better
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
a
long
time
ago
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
mother
,
you
know
you
would
n't
have
gone
before
quarter-past
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
should
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
little
woman
,
you
'd
say
anything
now
you
're
disagreeable
with
me
,
*NL*
would
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
forehead
that
he
knew
so
well
:
the
deep
marks
between
the
*NL*
brows
,
the
rising
of
the
fine
hair
,
greying
now
,
and
the
proud
setting
*NL*
of
the
temples
.
His
hand
lingered
on
her
shoulder
after
his
kiss
.
Then
*NL*
he
went
slowly
to
bed
.
He
had
forgotten
Miriam
;
he
only
saw
how
his
*NL*
mother
's
hair
was
lifted
back
from
her
warm
,
broad
brow
.
And
somehow
,
*NL*
she
was
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
next
time
he
saw
Miriam
he
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
me
be
late
to-night
--
not
later
than
ten
o'clock
.
My
mother
*NL*
gets
so
upset
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
dropped
her
bead
,
brooding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
she
get
upset
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
says
I
ought
n't
to
be
out
late
when
I
have
to
get
up
*NL*
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
!
''
said
Miriam
,
rather
quietly
,
with
just
a
touch
of
a
sneer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
resented
that
.
And
he
was
usually
late
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
there
was
any
love
growing
between
him
and
Miriam
neither
of
*NL*
them
would
have
acknowledged
.
He
thought
he
was
too
sane
for
such
*NL*
sentimentality
,
and
she
thought
herself
too
lofty
.
They
both
were
late
*NL*
in
coming
to
maturity
,
and
psychical
ripeness
was
much
behind
even
the
*NL*
physical
.
Miriam
was
exceedingly
sensitive
,
as
her
mother
had
always
*NL*
been
.
The
slightest
grossness
made
her
recoil
almost
in
anguish
.
Her
*NL*
brothers
were
brutal
,
but
never
coarse
in
speech
.
The
men
did
all
*NL*
the
discussing
of
farm
matters
outside
.
But
,
perhaps
,
because
of
the
*NL*
continual
business
of
birth
and
of
begetting
which
goes
on
upon
every
*NL*
farm
,
Miriam
was
the
more
hypersensitive
to
the
matter
,
and
her
blood
*NL*
was
chastened
almost
to
disgust
of
the
faintest
suggestion
of
such
*NL*
intercourse
.
Paul
took
his
pitch
from
her
,
and
their
intimacy
went
on
in
*NL*
an
utterly
blanched
and
chaste
fashion
.
It
could
never
be
mentioned
that
*NL*
the
mare
was
in
foal
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
nineteen
,
he
was
earning
only
twenty
shillings
a
week
,
but
*NL*
he
was
happy
.
His
painting
went
well
,
and
life
went
well
enough
.
On
the
*NL*
Good
Friday
he
organised
a
walk
to
the
Hemlock
Stone
.
There
were
three
*NL*
lads
of
his
own
age
,
then
Annie
and
Arthur
,
Miriam
and
Geoffrey
.
Arthur
,
*NL*
apprenticed
as
an
electrician
in
Nottingham
,
was
home
for
the
holiday
.
*NL*
Morel
,
as
usual
,
was
up
early
,
whistling
and
sawing
in
the
yard
.
At
*NL*
seven
o'clock
the
family
heard
him
buy
threepennyworth
of
hot-cross
*NL*
buns
;
he
talked
with
gusto
to
the
little
girl
who
brought
them
,
calling
*NL*
her
``
my
darling
''
.
He
turned
away
several
boys
who
came
with
more
buns
,
*NL*
telling
them
they
had
been
``
kested
''
by
a
little
lass
.
Then
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
got
up
,
and
the
family
straggled
down
.
It
was
an
immense
luxury
to
*NL*
everybody
,
this
lying
in
bed
just
beyond
the
ordinary
time
on
a
weekday
.
*NL*
And
Paul
and
Arthur
read
before
breakfast
,
and
had
the
meal
unwashed
,
*NL*
sitting
in
their
shirt-sleeves
.
This
was
another
holiday
luxury
.
The
*NL*
room
was
warm
.
Everything
felt
free
of
care
and
anxiety
.
There
was
a
*NL*
sense
of
plenty
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
boys
were
reading
,
Mrs.
Morel
went
into
the
garden
.
They
were
*NL*
now
in
another
house
,
an
old
one
,
near
the
Scargill
Street
home
,
which
*NL*
had
been
left
soon
after
William
had
died
.
Directly
came
an
excited
cry
*NL*
from
the
garden
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
!
Paul
!
come
and
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
his
mother
's
voice
.
He
threw
down
his
book
and
went
out
.
There
*NL*
was
a
long
garden
that
ran
to
a
field
.
It
was
a
grey
,
cold
day
,
with
a
*NL*
sharp
wind
blowing
out
of
Derbyshire
.
Two
fields
away
Bestwood
began
,
*NL*
with
a
jumble
of
roofs
and
red
house-ends
,
out
of
which
rose
the
church
*NL*
tower
and
the
spire
of
the
Congregational
Chapel
.
And
beyond
went
woods
*NL*
and
hills
,
right
away
to
the
pale
grey
heights
of
the
Pennine
Chain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
looked
down
the
garden
for
his
mother
.
Her
head
appeared
among
the
*NL*
young
currant-bushes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
looking
at
the
buds
on
the
currant
trees
.
Paul
went
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
here
I
might
never
have
seen
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
son
went
to
her
side
.
Under
the
fence
,
in
a
little
bed
,
was
a
ravel
*NL*
of
poor
grassy
leaves
,
such
as
come
from
very
immature
bulbs
,
and
three
*NL*
scyllas
in
bloom
.
Mrs.
Morel
pointed
to
the
deep
blue
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
just
see
those
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
I
was
looking
at
the
currant
*NL*
bushes
,
when
,
thinks
I
to
myself
,
`
There
's
something
very
blue
;
is
it
*NL*
a
bit
of
sugar-bag
?
'
and
there
,
behold
you
!
Sugar-bag
!
Three
glories
of
*NL*
the
snow
,
and
such
beauties
!
But
where
on
earth
did
they
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
a
marvel
,
now
!
I
THOUGHT
I
knew
every
weed
and
blade
in
*NL*
this
garden
.
But
HAVE
N'T
they
done
well
?
You
see
,
that
gooseberry-bush
*NL*
just
shelters
them
.
Not
nipped
,
not
touched
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
crouched
down
and
turned
up
the
bells
of
the
little
blue
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
a
glorious
colour
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
they
!
''
she
cried
.
``
I
guess
they
come
from
Switzerland
,
where
*NL*
they
say
they
have
such
lovely
things
.
Fancy
them
against
the
snow
!
But
*NL*
where
have
they
come
from
?
They
ca
n't
have
BLOWN
here
,
can
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
remembered
having
set
here
a
lot
of
little
trash
of
bulbs
to
*NL*
mature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
never
told
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
I
thought
I
'd
leave
it
till
they
might
flower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
you
see
!
I
might
have
missed
them
.
And
I
've
never
had
a
glory
*NL*
of
the
snow
in
my
garden
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
full
of
excitement
and
elation
.
The
garden
was
an
endless
joy
to
*NL*
her
.
Paul
was
thankful
for
her
sake
at
last
to
be
in
a
house
with
a
long
*NL*
garden
that
went
down
to
a
field
.
Every
morning
after
breakfast
she
went
*NL*
out
and
was
happy
pottering
about
in
it
.
And
it
was
true
,
she
knew
every
*NL*
weed
and
blade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
turned
up
for
the
walk
.
Food
was
packed
,
and
they
set
off
,
*NL*
a
merry
,
delighted
party
.
They
hung
over
the
wall
of
the
mill-race
,
*NL*
dropped
paper
in
the
water
on
one
side
of
the
tunnel
and
watched
it
*NL*
shoot
out
on
the
other
.
They
stood
on
the
foot-bridge
over
Boathouse
*NL*
Station
and
looked
at
the
metals
gleaming
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
see
the
Flying
Scotsman
come
through
at
half-past
six
!
''
said
*NL*
Leonard
,
whose
father
was
a
signalman
.
``
Lad
,
but
she
does
n't
half
buzz
!
''
*NL*
and
the
little
party
looked
up
the
lines
one
way
,
to
London
,
and
the
*NL*
other
way
,
to
Scotland
,
and
they
felt
the
touch
of
these
two
magical
*NL*
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Ilkeston
the
colliers
were
waiting
in
gangs
for
the
public-houses
to
*NL*
open
.
It
was
a
town
of
idleness
and
lounging
.
At
Stanton
Gate
the
iron
*NL*
foundry
blazed
.
Over
everything
there
were
great
discussions
.
At
Trowell
*NL*
they
crossed
again
from
Derbyshire
into
Nottinghamshire
.
They
came
to
*NL*
the
Hemlock
Stone
at
dinner-time
.
Its
field
was
crowded
with
folk
from
*NL*
Nottingham
and
Ilkeston
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
expected
a
venerable
and
dignified
monument
.
They
found
*NL*
a
little
,
gnarled
,
twisted
stump
of
rock
,
something
like
a
decayed
*NL*
mushroom
,
standing
out
pathetically
on
the
side
of
a
field
.
Leonard
and
*NL*
Dick
immediately
proceeded
to
carve
their
initials
,
``
L.
W.
''
and
``
R.
P.
''
,
*NL*
in
the
old
red
sandstone
;
but
Paul
desisted
,
because
he
had
read
in
the
*NL*
newspaper
satirical
remarks
about
initial-carvers
,
who
could
find
no
*NL*
other
road
to
immortality
.
Then
all
the
lads
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
*NL*
rock
to
look
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everywhere
in
the
field
below
,
factory
girls
and
lads
were
eating
*NL*
lunch
or
sporting
about
.
Beyond
was
the
garden
of
an
old
manor
.
It
had
*NL*
yew-hedges
and
thick
clumps
and
borders
of
yellow
crocuses
round
the
*NL*
lawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
said
Paul
to
Miriam
,
``
what
a
quiet
garden
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
the
dark
yews
and
the
golden
crocuses
,
then
she
looked
*NL*
gratefully
.
He
had
not
seemed
to
belong
to
her
among
all
these
others
;
*NL*
he
was
different
then
--
not
her
Paul
,
who
understood
the
slightest
quiver
*NL*
of
her
innermost
soul
,
but
something
else
,
speaking
another
language
*NL*
than
hers
.
How
it
hurt
her
,
and
deadened
her
very
perceptions
.
Only
when
*NL*
he
came
right
back
to
her
,
leaving
his
other
,
his
lesser
self
,
as
she
*NL*
thought
,
would
she
feel
alive
again
.
And
now
he
asked
her
to
look
at
*NL*
this
garden
,
wanting
the
contact
with
her
again
.
Impatient
of
the
set
*NL*
in
the
field
,
she
turned
to
the
quiet
lawn
,
surrounded
by
sheaves
of
*NL*
shut-up
crocuses
.
A
feeling
of
stillness
,
almost
of
ecstasy
,
came
over
*NL*
her
.
It
felt
almost
as
if
she
were
alone
with
him
in
this
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
left
her
again
and
joined
the
others
.
Soon
they
started
home
.
*NL*
Miriam
loitered
behind
,
alone
.
She
did
not
fit
in
with
the
others
;
she
*NL*
could
very
rarely
get
into
human
relations
with
anyone
:
so
her
friend
,
*NL*
her
companion
,
her
lover
,
was
Nature
.
She
saw
the
sun
declining
wanly
.
*NL*
In
the
dusky
,
cold
hedgerows
were
some
red
leaves
.
She
lingered
to
*NL*
gather
them
,
tenderly
,
passionately
.
The
love
in
her
finger-tips
*NL*
caressed
the
leaves
;
the
passion
in
her
heart
came
to
a
glow
upon
the
*NL*
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
realised
she
was
alone
in
a
strange
road
,
and
she
hurried
*NL*
forward
.
Turning
a
corner
in
the
lane
,
she
came
upon
Paul
,
who
stood
*NL*
bent
over
something
,
his
mind
fixed
on
it
,
working
away
steadily
,
*NL*
patiently
,
a
little
hopelessly
.
She
hesitated
in
her
approach
,
to
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
concentrated
in
the
middle
of
the
road
.
Beyond
,
one
rift
of
*NL*
rich
gold
in
that
colourless
grey
evening
seemed
to
make
him
stand
out
*NL*
in
dark
relief
.
She
saw
him
,
slender
and
firm
,
as
if
the
setting
sun
had
*NL*
given
him
to
her
.
A
deep
pain
took
hold
of
her
,
and
she
knew
she
*NL*
must
love
him
.
And
she
had
discovered
him
,
discovered
in
him
a
*NL*
rare
potentiality
,
discovered
his
loneliness
.
Quivering
as
at
some
*NL*
``
annunciation
''
,
she
went
slowly
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
he
exclaimed
gratefully
,
``
have
you
waited
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
a
deep
shadow
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
spring
broken
here
;
''
and
he
showed
her
where
his
umbrella
was
*NL*
injured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
,
with
some
shame
,
she
knew
he
had
not
done
the
damage
himself
,
*NL*
but
that
Geoffrey
was
responsible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
an
old
umbrella
,
is
n't
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
why
he
,
who
did
not
usually
trouble
over
trifles
,
made
such
*NL*
a
mountain
of
this
molehill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
was
William
's
an
'
my
mother
ca
n't
help
but
know
,
''
he
said
*NL*
quietly
,
still
patiently
working
at
the
umbrella
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
went
through
Miriam
like
a
blade
.
This
,
then
,
was
the
*NL*
confirmation
of
her
vision
of
him
!
She
looked
at
him
.
But
there
was
*NL*
about
him
a
certain
reserve
,
and
she
dared
not
comfort
him
,
not
even
*NL*
speak
softly
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
ca
n't
do
it
;
''
and
they
went
in
silence
along
the
*NL*
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
evening
they
were
walking
along
under
the
trees
by
Nether
*NL*
Green
.
He
was
talking
to
her
fretfully
,
seemed
to
be
struggling
to
*NL*
convince
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
he
said
,
with
an
effort
,
``
if
one
person
loves
,
the
other
*NL*
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
answered
.
``
Like
mother
said
to
me
when
I
was
little
,
`
Love
*NL*
begets
love
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
something
like
that
,
I
think
it
MUST
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
,
because
,
if
it
were
not
,
love
might
be
a
very
terrible
*NL*
thing
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
it
IS
--
at
least
with
most
people
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Miriam
,
thinking
he
had
assured
himself
,
felt
strong
in
herself
.
She
*NL*
always
regarded
that
sudden
coming
upon
him
in
the
lane
as
a
revelation
.
*NL*
And
this
conversation
remained
graven
in
her
mind
as
one
of
the
letters
*NL*
of
the
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
stood
with
him
and
for
him
.
When
,
about
this
time
,
he
outraged
*NL*
the
family
feeling
at
Willey
Farm
by
some
overbearing
insult
,
she
stuck
*NL*
to
him
,
and
believed
he
was
right
.
And
at
this
time
she
dreamed
*NL*
dreams
of
him
,
vivid
,
unforgettable
.
These
dreams
came
again
later
on
,
*NL*
developed
to
a
more
subtle
psychological
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Easter
Monday
the
same
party
took
an
excursion
to
Wingfield
*NL*
Manor
.
It
was
great
excitement
to
Miriam
to
catch
a
train
at
Sethley
*NL*
Bridge
,
amid
all
the
bustle
of
the
Bank
Holiday
crowd
.
They
left
the
*NL*
train
at
Alfreton
.
Paul
was
interested
in
the
street
and
in
the
colliers
*NL*
with
their
dogs
.
Here
was
a
new
race
of
miners
.
Miriam
did
not
live
till
*NL*
they
came
to
the
church
.
They
were
all
rather
timid
of
entering
,
with
*NL*
their
bags
of
food
,
for
fear
of
being
turned
out
.
Leonard
,
a
comic
,
thin
*NL*
fellow
,
went
first
;
Paul
,
who
would
have
died
rather
than
be
sent
back
,
*NL*
went
last
.
The
place
was
decorated
for
Easter
.
In
the
font
hundreds
of
*NL*
white
narcissi
seemed
to
be
growing
.
The
air
was
dim
and
coloured
from
*NL*
the
windows
and
thrilled
with
a
subtle
scent
of
lilies
and
narcissi
.
In
*NL*
that
atmosphere
Miriam
's
soul
came
into
a
glow
.
Paul
was
afraid
of
the
*NL*
things
he
must
n't
do
;
and
he
was
sensitive
to
the
feel
of
the
place
.
*NL*
Miriam
turned
to
him
.
He
answered
.
They
were
together
.
He
would
not
go
*NL*
beyond
the
Communion-rail
.
She
loved
him
for
that
.
Her
soul
expanded
*NL*
into
prayer
beside
him
.
He
felt
the
strange
fascination
of
shadowy
*NL*
religious
places
.
All
his
latent
mysticism
quivered
into
life
.
She
was
*NL*
drawn
to
him
.
He
was
a
prayer
along
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
very
rarely
talked
to
the
other
lads
.
They
at
once
became
awkward
*NL*
in
conversation
with
her
.
So
usually
she
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
past
midday
when
they
climbed
the
steep
path
to
the
manor
.
*NL*
All
things
shone
softly
in
the
sun
,
which
was
wonderfully
warm
and
*NL*
enlivening
.
Celandines
and
violets
were
out
.
Everybody
was
tip-top
full
*NL*
with
happiness
.
The
glitter
of
the
ivy
,
the
soft
,
atmospheric
grey
*NL*
of
the
castle
walls
,
the
gentleness
of
everything
near
the
ruin
,
was
*NL*
perfect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manor
is
of
hard
,
pale
grey
stone
,
and
the
other
walls
are
blank
and
*NL*
calm
.
The
young
folk
were
in
raptures
.
They
went
in
trepidation
,
almost
*NL*
afraid
that
the
delight
of
exploring
this
ruin
might
be
denied
them
.
In
*NL*
the
first
courtyard
,
within
the
high
broken
walls
,
were
farm-carts
,
with
*NL*
their
shafts
lying
idle
on
the
ground
,
the
tyres
of
the
wheels
brilliant
*NL*
with
gold-red
rust
.
It
was
very
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
eagerly
paid
their
sixpences
,
and
went
timidly
through
the
fine
*NL*
clean
arch
of
the
inner
courtyard
.
They
were
shy
.
Here
on
the
pavement
,
*NL*
where
the
hall
had
been
,
an
old
thorn
tree
was
budding
.
All
kinds
of
*NL*
strange
openings
and
broken
rooms
were
in
the
shadow
around
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
lunch
they
set
off
once
more
to
explore
the
ruin
.
This
time
the
*NL*
girls
went
with
the
boys
,
who
could
act
as
guides
and
expositors
.
There
*NL*
was
one
tall
tower
in
a
corner
,
rather
tottering
,
where
they
say
Mary
*NL*
Queen
of
Scots
was
imprisoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
of
the
Queen
going
up
here
!
''
said
Miriam
in
a
low
voice
,
as
she
*NL*
climbed
the
hollow
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
could
get
up
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
for
she
had
rheumatism
like
anything
.
*NL*
I
reckon
they
treated
her
rottenly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
think
she
deserved
it
?
''
asked
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
.
She
was
only
lively
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
continued
to
mount
the
winding
staircase
.
A
high
wind
,
blowing
*NL*
through
the
loopholes
,
went
rushing
up
the
shaft
,
and
filled
the
girl
's
*NL*
skirts
like
a
balloon
,
so
that
she
was
ashamed
,
until
he
took
the
hem
*NL*
of
her
dress
and
held
it
down
for
her
.
He
did
it
perfectly
simply
,
as
he
*NL*
would
have
picked
up
her
glove
.
She
remembered
this
always
.
*NL*
*NL*
Round
the
broken
top
of
the
tower
the
ivy
bushed
out
,
old
and
handsome
.
*NL*
Also
,
there
were
a
few
chill
gillivers
,
in
pale
cold
bud
.
Miriam
wanted
*NL*
to
lean
over
for
some
ivy
,
but
he
would
not
let
her
.
Instead
,
she
had
to
*NL*
wait
behind
him
,
and
take
from
him
each
spray
as
he
gathered
it
and
held
*NL*
it
to
her
,
each
one
separately
,
in
the
purest
manner
of
chivalry
.
The
*NL*
tower
seemed
to
rock
in
the
wind
.
They
looked
over
miles
and
miles
of
*NL*
wooded
country
,
and
country
with
gleams
of
pasture
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crypt
underneath
the
manor
was
beautiful
,
and
in
perfect
*NL*
preservation
.
Paul
made
a
drawing
:
Miriam
stayed
with
him
.
She
was
*NL*
thinking
of
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
looking
with
her
strained
,
hopeless
*NL*
eyes
,
that
could
not
understand
misery
,
over
the
hills
whence
no
help
*NL*
came
,
or
sitting
in
this
crypt
,
being
told
of
a
God
as
cold
as
the
place
*NL*
she
sat
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
set
off
again
gaily
,
looking
round
on
their
beloved
manor
that
*NL*
stood
so
clean
and
big
on
its
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Supposing
you
could
have
THAT
farm
,
''
said
Paul
to
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
it
be
lovely
to
come
and
see
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
now
in
the
bare
country
of
stone
walls
,
which
he
loved
,
and
*NL*
which
,
though
only
ten
miles
from
home
,
seemed
so
foreign
to
Miriam
.
The
*NL*
party
was
straggling
.
As
they
were
crossing
a
large
meadow
that
*NL*
sloped
away
from
the
sun
,
along
a
path
embedded
with
innumerable
tiny
*NL*
glittering
points
,
Paul
,
walking
alongside
,
laced
his
fingers
in
the
*NL*
strings
of
the
bag
Miriam
was
carrying
,
and
instantly
she
felt
Annie
*NL*
behind
,
watchful
and
jealous
.
But
the
meadow
was
bathed
in
a
glory
of
*NL*
sunshine
,
and
the
path
was
jewelled
,
and
it
was
seldom
that
he
gave
her
*NL*
any
sign
.
She
held
her
fingers
very
still
among
the
strings
of
the
bag
,
*NL*
his
fingers
touching
;
and
the
place
was
golden
as
a
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
came
into
the
straggling
grey
village
of
Crich
,
that
lies
*NL*
high
.
Beyond
the
village
was
the
famous
Crich
Stand
that
Paul
could
see
*NL*
from
the
garden
at
home
.
The
party
pushed
on
.
Great
expanse
of
country
*NL*
spread
around
and
below
.
The
lads
were
eager
to
get
to
the
top
of
the
*NL*
hill
.
It
was
capped
by
a
round
knoll
,
half
of
which
was
by
now
cut
away
,
*NL*
and
on
the
top
of
which
stood
an
ancient
monument
,
sturdy
and
squat
,
for
*NL*
signalling
in
old
days
far
down
into
the
level
lands
of
Nottinghamshire
*NL*
and
Leicestershire
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
blowing
so
hard
,
high
up
there
in
the
exposed
place
,
that
the
*NL*
only
way
to
be
safe
was
to
stand
nailed
by
the
wind
to
the
wan
of
the
*NL*
tower
.
At
their
feet
fell
the
precipice
where
the
limestone
was
quarried
*NL*
away
.
Below
was
a
jumble
of
hills
and
tiny
villages
--
Mattock
,
Ambergate
,
*NL*
Stoney
Middleton
.
The
lads
were
eager
to
spy
out
the
church
of
Bestwood
,
*NL*
far
away
among
the
rather
crowded
country
on
the
left
.
They
were
*NL*
disgusted
that
it
seemed
to
stand
on
a
plain
.
They
saw
the
hills
of
*NL*
Derbyshire
fall
into
the
monotony
of
the
Midlands
that
swept
away
South
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
was
somewhat
scared
by
the
wind
,
but
the
lads
enjoyed
it
.
They
*NL*
went
on
,
miles
and
miles
,
to
Whatstandwell
.
All
the
food
was
eaten
,
*NL*
everybody
was
hungry
,
and
there
was
very
little
money
to
get
home
with
.
*NL*
But
they
managed
to
procure
a
loaf
and
a
currant-loaf
,
which
they
hacked
*NL*
to
pieces
with
shut-knives
,
and
ate
sitting
on
the
wall
near
the
bridge
,
*NL*
watching
the
bright
Derwent
rushing
by
,
and
the
brakes
from
Matlock
*NL*
pulling
up
at
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
now
pale
with
weariness
.
He
had
been
responsible
for
the
party
*NL*
all
day
,
and
now
he
was
done
.
Miriam
understood
,
and
kept
close
to
him
,
*NL*
and
he
left
himself
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
an
hour
to
wait
at
Ambergate
Station
.
Trains
came
,
crowded
with
*NL*
excursionists
returning
to
Manchester
,
Birmingham
,
and
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
might
be
going
there
--
folk
easily
might
think
we
're
going
that
far
,
''
*NL*
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
got
back
rather
late
.
Miriam
,
walking
home
with
Geoffrey
,
watched
*NL*
the
moon
rise
big
and
red
and
misty
.
She
felt
something
was
fulfilled
in
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
an
elder
sister
,
Agatha
,
who
was
a
school-teacher
.
Between
the
*NL*
two
girls
was
a
feud
.
Miriam
considered
Agatha
worldly
.
And
she
wanted
*NL*
herself
to
be
a
school-teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Saturday
afternoon
Agatha
and
Miriam
were
upstairs
dressing
.
Their
*NL*
bedroom
was
over
the
stable
.
It
was
a
low
room
,
not
very
large
,
and
*NL*
bare
.
Miriam
had
nailed
on
the
wall
a
reproduction
of
Veronese
's
``
St.
*NL*
Catherine
''
.
She
loved
the
woman
who
sat
in
the
window
,
dreaming
.
Her
*NL*
own
windows
were
too
small
to
sit
in
.
But
the
front
one
was
dripped
over
*NL*
with
honeysuckle
and
virginia
creeper
,
and
looked
upon
the
tree-tops
of
*NL*
the
oak-wood
across
the
yard
,
while
the
little
back
window
,
no
bigger
*NL*
than
a
handkerchief
,
was
a
loophole
to
the
east
,
to
the
dawn
beating
up
*NL*
against
the
beloved
round
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
sisters
did
not
talk
much
to
each
other
.
Agatha
,
who
was
fair
*NL*
and
small
and
determined
,
had
rebelled
against
the
home
atmosphere
,
*NL*
against
the
doctrine
of
``
the
other
cheek
''
.
She
was
out
in
the
world
now
,
*NL*
in
a
fair
way
to
be
independent
.
And
she
insisted
on
worldly
values
,
*NL*
on
appearance
,
on
manners
,
on
position
,
which
Miriam
would
fain
have
*NL*
ignored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
girls
liked
to
be
upstairs
,
out
of
the
way
,
when
Paul
came
.
They
*NL*
preferred
to
come
running
down
,
open
the
stair-foot
door
,
and
see
him
*NL*
watching
,
expectant
of
them
.
Miriam
stood
painfully
pulling
over
her
*NL*
head
a
rosary
he
had
given
her
.
It
caught
in
the
fine
mesh
of
her
hair
.
*NL*
But
at
last
she
had
it
on
,
and
the
red-brown
wooden
beads
looked
well
*NL*
against
her
cool
brown
neck
.
She
was
a
well-developed
girl
,
and
very
*NL*
handsome
.
But
in
the
little
looking-glass
nailed
against
the
whitewashed
*NL*
wall
she
could
only
see
a
fragment
of
herself
at
a
time
.
Agatha
had
*NL*
bought
a
little
mirror
of
her
own
,
which
she
propped
up
to
suit
herself
.
*NL*
Miriam
was
near
the
window
.
Suddenly
she
heard
the
well-known
click
of
*NL*
the
chain
,
and
she
saw
Paul
fling
open
the
gate
,
push
his
bicycle
into
*NL*
the
yard
.
She
saw
him
look
at
the
house
,
and
she
shrank
away
.
He
walked
*NL*
in
a
nonchalant
fashion
,
and
his
bicycle
went
with
him
as
if
it
were
a
*NL*
live
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
's
come
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
glad
?
''
said
Agatha
cuttingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
stood
still
in
amazement
and
bewilderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
are
n't
you
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
'm
not
going
to
let
him
see
it
,
and
think
I
wanted
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
was
startled
.
She
heard
him
putting
his
bicycle
in
the
stable
*NL*
underneath
,
and
talking
to
Jimmy
,
who
had
been
a
pit-horse
,
and
who
was
*NL*
seedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jimmy
my
lad
,
how
are
ter
?
Nobbut
sick
an
'
sadly
,
like
?
Why
,
*NL*
then
,
it
's
a
shame
,
my
owd
lad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
the
rope
run
through
the
hole
as
the
horse
lifted
its
head
*NL*
from
the
lad
's
caress
.
How
she
loved
to
listen
when
he
thought
only
*NL*
the
horse
could
hear
.
But
there
was
a
serpent
in
her
Eden
.
She
searched
*NL*
earnestly
in
herself
to
see
if
she
wanted
Paul
Morel
.
She
felt
there
*NL*
would
be
some
disgrace
in
it
.
Full
of
twisted
feeling
,
she
was
afraid
*NL*
she
did
want
him
.
She
stood
self-convicted
.
Then
came
an
agony
of
new
*NL*
shame
.
She
shrank
within
herself
in
a
coil
of
torture
.
Did
she
want
Paul
*NL*
Morel
,
and
did
he
know
she
wanted
him
?
What
a
subtle
infamy
upon
her
.
*NL*
She
felt
as
if
her
whole
soul
coiled
into
knots
of
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Agatha
was
dressed
first
,
and
ran
downstairs
.
Miriam
heard
her
greet
*NL*
the
lad
gaily
,
knew
exactly
how
brilliant
her
grey
eyes
became
with
that
*NL*
tone
.
She
herself
would
have
felt
it
bold
to
have
greeted
him
in
such
*NL*
wise
.
Yet
there
she
stood
under
the
self-accusation
of
wanting
him
,
*NL*
tied
to
that
stake
of
torture
.
In
bitter
perplexity
she
kneeled
down
and
*NL*
prayed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord
,
let
me
not
love
Paul
Morel
.
Keep
me
from
loving
him
,
if
I
ought
*NL*
not
to
love
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
anomalous
in
the
prayer
arrested
her
.
She
lifted
her
head
and
*NL*
pondered
.
How
could
it
be
wrong
to
love
him
?
Love
was
God
's
gift
.
And
*NL*
yet
it
caused
her
shame
.
That
was
because
of
him
,
Paul
Morel
.
But
,
then
,
*NL*
it
was
not
his
affair
,
it
was
her
own
,
between
herself
and
God
.
She
was
*NL*
to
be
a
sacrifice
.
But
it
was
God
's
sacrifice
,
not
Paul
Morel
's
or
her
*NL*
own
.
After
a
few
minutes
she
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
again
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Lord
,
if
it
is
Thy
will
that
I
should
love
him
,
make
me
love
*NL*
him
--
as
Christ
would
,
who
died
for
the
souls
of
men
.
Make
me
love
him
*NL*
splendidly
,
because
he
is
Thy
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
kneeling
for
some
time
,
quite
still
,
and
deeply
moved
,
her
*NL*
black
hair
against
the
red
squares
and
the
lavender-sprigged
squares
of
*NL*
the
patchwork
quilt
.
Prayer
was
almost
essential
to
her
.
Then
she
fell
*NL*
into
that
rapture
of
self-sacrifice
,
identifying
herself
with
a
God
who
*NL*
was
sacrificed
,
which
gives
to
so
many
human
souls
their
deepest
bliss
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
downstairs
Paul
was
lying
back
in
an
armchair
,
holding
*NL*
forth
with
much
vehemence
to
Agatha
,
who
was
scorning
a
little
painting
*NL*
he
had
brought
to
show
her
.
Miriam
glanced
at
the
two
,
and
avoided
their
*NL*
levity
.
She
went
into
the
parlour
to
be
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
tea-time
before
she
was
able
to
speak
to
Paul
,
and
then
her
*NL*
manner
was
so
distant
he
thought
he
had
offended
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
discontinued
her
practice
of
going
each
Thursday
evening
to
the
*NL*
library
in
Bestwood
.
After
calling
for
Paul
regularly
during
the
whole
*NL*
spring
,
a
number
of
trifling
incidents
and
tiny
insults
from
his
family
*NL*
awakened
her
to
their
attitude
towards
her
,
and
she
decided
to
go
no
*NL*
more
.
So
she
announced
to
Paul
one
evening
she
would
not
call
at
his
*NL*
house
again
for
him
on
Thursday
nights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
he
asked
,
very
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
Only
I
'd
rather
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
she
faltered
,
``
if
you
'd
care
to
meet
me
,
we
could
still
go
*NL*
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meet
you
where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somewhere
--
where
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
meet
you
anywhere
.
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
n't
keep
calling
*NL*
for
me
.
But
if
you
wo
n't
,
I
do
n't
want
to
meet
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
Thursday
evenings
which
had
been
so
precious
to
her
,
and
to
him
,
*NL*
were
dropped
.
He
worked
instead
.
Mrs.
Morel
sniffed
with
satisfaction
at
*NL*
this
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
not
have
it
that
they
were
lovers
.
The
intimacy
between
them
*NL*
had
been
kept
so
abstract
,
such
a
matter
of
the
soul
,
all
thought
and
*NL*
weary
struggle
into
consciousness
,
that
he
saw
it
only
as
a
platonic
*NL*
friendship
.
He
stoutly
denied
there
was
anything
else
between
them
.
*NL*
Miriam
was
silent
,
or
else
she
very
quietly
agreed
.
He
was
a
fool
who
*NL*
did
not
know
what
was
happening
to
himself
.
By
tacit
agreement
they
*NL*
ignored
the
remarks
and
insinuations
of
their
acquaintances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
n't
lovers
,
we
are
friends
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
``
WE
know
it
.
Let
*NL*
them
talk
.
What
does
it
matter
what
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
as
they
were
walking
together
,
she
slipped
her
arm
timidly
*NL*
into
his
.
But
he
always
resented
it
,
and
she
knew
it
.
It
caused
a
*NL*
violent
conflict
in
him
.
With
Miriam
he
was
always
on
the
high
plane
of
*NL*
abstraction
,
when
his
natural
fire
of
love
was
transmitted
into
the
fine
*NL*
stream
of
thought
.
She
would
have
it
so
.
If
he
were
jolly
and
,
as
she
*NL*
put
it
,
flippant
,
she
waited
till
he
came
back
to
her
,
till
the
change
*NL*
had
taken
place
in
him
again
,
and
he
was
wrestling
with
his
own
soul
,
*NL*
frowning
,
passionate
in
his
desire
for
understanding
.
And
in
this
*NL*
passion
for
understanding
her
soul
lay
close
to
his
;
she
had
him
all
to
*NL*
herself
.
But
he
must
be
made
abstract
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
if
she
put
her
arm
in
his
,
it
caused
him
almost
torture
.
His
*NL*
consciousness
seemed
to
split
.
The
place
where
she
was
touching
him
ran
*NL*
hot
with
friction
.
He
was
one
internecine
battle
,
and
he
became
cruel
to
*NL*
her
because
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
in
midsummer
Miriam
called
at
the
house
,
warm
from
climbing
.
*NL*
Paul
was
alone
in
the
kitchen
;
his
mother
could
be
heard
moving
about
*NL*
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
look
at
the
sweet-peas
,
''
he
said
to
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
into
the
garden
.
The
sky
behind
the
townlet
and
the
church
was
*NL*
orange-red
;
the
flower-garden
was
flooded
with
a
strange
warm
light
that
*NL*
lifted
every
leaf
into
significance
.
Paul
passed
along
a
fine
row
of
*NL*
sweet-peas
,
gathering
a
blossom
here
and
there
,
all
cream
and
pale
blue
.
*NL*
Miriam
followed
,
breathing
the
fragrance
.
To
her
,
flowers
appealed
with
*NL*
such
strength
she
felt
she
must
make
them
part
of
herself
.
When
she
bent
*NL*
and
breathed
a
flower
,
it
was
as
if
she
and
the
flower
were
loving
each
*NL*
other
.
Paul
hated
her
for
it
.
There
seemed
a
sort
of
exposure
about
the
*NL*
action
,
something
too
intimate
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
got
a
fair
bunch
,
they
returned
to
the
house
.
He
listened
*NL*
for
a
moment
to
his
mother
's
quiet
movement
upstairs
,
then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
and
let
me
pin
them
in
for
you
.
''
He
arranged
them
two
or
*NL*
three
at
a
time
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
,
stepping
back
now
and
then
to
*NL*
see
the
effect
.
``
You
know
,
''
he
said
,
taking
the
pin
out
of
his
mouth
,
``
a
*NL*
woman
ought
always
to
arrange
her
flowers
before
her
glass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
laughed
.
She
thought
flowers
ought
to
be
pinned
in
one
's
dress
*NL*
without
any
care
.
That
Paul
should
take
pains
to
fix
her
flowers
for
her
*NL*
was
his
whim
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
rather
offended
at
her
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
women
do
--
those
who
look
decent
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
laughed
again
,
but
mirthlessly
,
to
hear
him
thus
mix
her
up
with
*NL*
women
in
a
general
way
.
From
most
men
she
would
have
ignored
it
.
But
*NL*
from
him
it
hurt
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
nearly
finished
arranging
the
flowers
when
he
heard
his
mother
's
*NL*
footstep
on
the
stairs
.
Hurriedly
he
pushed
in
the
last
pin
and
turned
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
mater
know
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
picked
up
her
books
and
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
with
chagrin
*NL*
at
the
beautiful
sunset
.
She
would
call
for
Paul
no
more
,
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-evening
,
Mrs.
Morel
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
deferential
way
.
She
sounded
*NL*
as
if
she
felt
she
had
no
right
to
be
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
it
you
,
Miriam
?
''
replied
Mrs.
Morel
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Paul
insisted
on
everybody
's
accepting
his
friendship
with
the
girl
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Morel
was
too
wise
to
have
any
open
rupture
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
he
was
twenty
years
old
that
the
family
could
ever
*NL*
afford
to
go
away
for
a
holiday
.
Mrs.
Morel
had
never
been
away
for
a
*NL*
holiday
,
except
to
see
her
sister
,
since
she
had
been
married
.
Now
at
*NL*
last
Paul
had
saved
enough
money
,
and
they
were
all
going
.
There
was
to
*NL*
be
a
party
:
some
of
Annie
's
friends
,
one
friend
of
Paul
's
,
a
young
man
*NL*
in
the
same
office
where
William
had
previously
been
,
and
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
great
excitement
writing
for
rooms
.
Paul
and
his
mother
debated
*NL*
it
endlessly
between
them
.
They
wanted
a
furnished
cottage
for
two
*NL*
weeks
.
She
thought
one
week
would
be
enough
,
but
he
insisted
on
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
got
an
answer
from
Mablethorpe
,
a
cottage
such
as
they
*NL*
wished
for
thirty
shillings
a
week
.
There
was
immense
jubilation
.
Paul
*NL*
was
wild
with
joy
for
his
mother
's
sake
.
She
would
have
a
real
holiday
*NL*
now
.
He
and
she
sat
at
evening
picturing
what
it
would
be
like
.
Annie
*NL*
came
in
,
and
Leonard
,
and
Alice
,
and
Kitty
.
There
was
wild
rejoicing
and
*NL*
anticipation
.
Paul
told
Miriam
.
She
seemed
to
brood
with
joy
over
it
.
*NL*
But
the
Morel
's
house
rang
with
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
to
go
on
Saturday
morning
by
the
seven
train
.
Paul
suggested
*NL*
that
Miriam
should
sleep
at
his
house
,
because
it
was
so
far
for
her
*NL*
to
walk
.
She
came
down
for
supper
.
Everybody
was
so
excited
that
even
*NL*
Miriam
was
accepted
with
warmth
.
But
almost
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
*NL*
feeling
in
the
family
became
close
and
tight
.
He
had
discovered
a
poem
*NL*
by
Jean
Ingelow
which
mentioned
Mablethorpe
,
and
so
he
must
read
it
*NL*
to
Miriam
.
He
would
never
have
got
so
far
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
sentimentality
as
to
read
poetry
to
his
own
family
.
But
now
they
*NL*
condescended
to
listen
.
Miriam
sat
on
the
sofa
absorbed
in
him
.
She
*NL*
always
seemed
absorbed
in
him
,
and
by
him
,
when
he
was
present
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
sat
jealously
in
her
own
chair
.
She
was
going
to
hear
also
.
And
*NL*
even
Annie
and
the
father
attended
,
Morel
with
his
head
cocked
on
one
*NL*
side
,
like
somebody
listening
to
a
sermon
and
feeling
conscious
of
*NL*
the
fact
.
Paul
ducked
his
head
over
the
book
.
He
had
got
now
all
the
*NL*
audience
he
cared
for
.
And
Mrs.
Morel
and
Annie
almost
contested
with
*NL*
Miriam
who
should
listen
best
and
win
his
favour
.
He
was
in
very
high
*NL*
feather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
interrupted
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
what
IS
the
`
Bride
of
Enderby
'
that
the
*NL*
bells
are
supposed
to
ring
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
an
old
tune
they
used
to
play
on
the
bells
for
a
warning
against
*NL*
water
.
I
suppose
the
Bride
of
Enderby
was
drowned
in
a
flood
,
''
he
*NL*
replied
.
He
had
not
the
faintest
knowledge
what
it
really
was
,
but
he
*NL*
would
never
have
sunk
so
low
as
to
confess
that
to
his
womenfolk
.
They
*NL*
listened
and
believed
him
.
He
believed
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
people
knew
what
that
tune
meant
?
''
said
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
just
like
the
Scotch
when
they
heard
`
The
Flowers
o
'
the
*NL*
Forest
'
--
and
when
they
used
to
ring
the
bells
backward
for
alarm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
said
Annie
.
``
A
bell
sounds
the
same
whether
it
's
rung
backwards
*NL*
or
forwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
you
start
with
the
deep
bell
and
ring
up
to
the
high
*NL*
one
--
der
--
der
--
der
--
der

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
up
the
scale
.
Everybody
thought
it
clever
.
He
thought
so
too
.
*NL*
Then
,
waiting
a
minute
,
he
continued
the
poem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hm
!
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
curiously
,
when
he
finished
.
``
But
I
wish
*NL*
everything
that
's
written
were
n't
so
sad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
canna
see
what
they
want
drownin
'
theirselves
for
,
''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
.
Annie
got
up
to
clear
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
rose
to
help
with
the
pots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
ME
help
to
wash
up
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
,
''
cried
Annie
.
``
You
sit
down
again
.
There
are
n't
many
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Miriam
,
who
could
not
be
familiar
and
insist
,
sat
down
again
to
look
*NL*
at
the
book
with
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
master
of
the
party
;
his
father
was
no
good
.
And
great
tortures
*NL*
he
suffered
lest
the
tin
box
should
be
put
out
at
Firsby
instead
of
at
*NL*
Mablethorpe
.
And
he
was
n't
equal
to
getting
a
carriage
.
His
bold
little
*NL*
mother
did
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
''
she
cried
to
a
man
.
``
Here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
and
Annie
got
behind
the
rest
,
convulsed
with
shamed
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
will
it
be
to
drive
to
Brook
Cottage
?
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
shillings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
how
far
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
scrambled
in
.
There
were
eight
crowded
in
one
old
seaside
*NL*
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
it
's
only
threepence
each
,
and
if
it
were
a
*NL*
tramcar
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
along
.
Each
cottage
they
came
to
,
Mrs.
Morel
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
this
?
Now
,
this
is
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
sat
breathless
.
They
drove
past
.
There
was
a
universal
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
thankful
it
was
n't
that
brute
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
I
WAS
*NL*
frightened
.
''
They
drove
on
and
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
they
descended
at
a
house
that
stood
alone
over
the
dyke
by
the
*NL*
highroad
.
There
was
wild
excitement
because
they
had
to
cross
a
little
*NL*
bridge
to
get
into
the
front
garden
.
But
they
loved
the
house
that
lay
*NL*
so
solitary
,
with
a
sea-meadow
on
one
side
,
and
immense
expanse
of
land
*NL*
patched
in
white
barley
,
yellow
oats
,
red
wheat
,
and
green
root-crops
,
*NL*
flat
and
stretching
level
to
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
kept
accounts
.
He
and
his
mother
ran
the
show
.
The
total
*NL*
expenses
--
lodging
,
food
,
everything
--
was
sixteen
shillings
a
week
per
*NL*
person
.
He
and
Leonard
went
bathing
in
the
mornings
.
Morel
was
wandering
*NL*
abroad
quite
early
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
Paul
,
''
his
mother
called
from
the
bedroom
,
``
eat
a
piece
of
*NL*
bread-and-butter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
he
got
back
he
saw
his
mother
presiding
in
state
at
the
*NL*
breakfast-table
.
The
woman
of
the
house
was
young
.
Her
husband
was
*NL*
blind
,
and
she
did
laundry
work
.
So
Mrs.
Morel
always
washed
the
pots
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
and
made
the
beds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
said
you
'd
have
a
real
holiday
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
and
now
you
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Work
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
What
are
you
talking
about
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
loved
to
go
with
her
across
the
fields
to
the
village
and
the
sea
.
*NL*
She
was
afraid
of
the
plank
bridge
,
and
he
abused
her
for
being
a
baby
.
*NL*
On
the
whole
he
stuck
to
her
as
if
he
were
HER
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
did
not
get
much
of
him
,
except
,
perhaps
,
when
all
the
others
*NL*
went
to
the
``
Coons
''
.
Coons
were
insufferably
stupid
to
Miriam
,
so
he
*NL*
thought
they
were
to
himself
also
,
and
he
preached
priggishly
to
Annie
*NL*
about
the
fatuity
of
listening
to
them
.
Yet
he
,
too
,
knew
all
their
*NL*
songs
,
and
sang
them
along
the
roads
roisterously
.
And
if
he
found
*NL*
himself
listening
,
the
stupidity
pleased
him
very
much
.
Yet
to
Annie
he
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
rot
!
there
is
n't
a
grain
of
intelligence
in
it
.
Nobody
with
more
*NL*
gumption
than
a
grasshopper
could
go
and
sit
and
listen
.
''
And
to
Miriam
*NL*
he
said
,
with
much
scorn
of
Annie
and
the
others
:
``
I
suppose
they
're
at
*NL*
the
`
Coons
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
queer
to
see
Miriam
singing
coon
songs
.
She
had
a
straight
chin
*NL*
that
went
in
a
perpendicular
line
from
the
lower
lip
to
the
turn
.
She
*NL*
always
reminded
Paul
of
some
sad
Botticelli
angel
when
she
sang
,
even
*NL*
when
it
was
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
down
lover
's
lane
*NL*
For
a
walk
with
me
,
talk
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
when
he
sketched
,
or
at
evening
when
the
others
were
at
the
*NL*
``
Coons
''
,
she
had
him
to
herself
.
He
talked
to
her
endlessly
about
his
*NL*
love
of
horizontals
:
how
they
,
the
great
levels
of
sky
and
land
in
*NL*
Lincolnshire
,
meant
to
him
the
eternality
of
the
will
,
just
as
the
bowed
*NL*
Norman
arches
of
the
church
,
repeating
themselves
,
meant
the
dogged
*NL*
leaping
forward
of
the
persistent
human
soul
,
on
and
on
,
nobody
knows
*NL*
where
;
in
contradiction
to
the
perpendicular
lines
and
to
the
Gothic
*NL*
arch
,
which
,
he
said
,
leapt
up
at
heaven
and
touched
the
ecstasy
and
*NL*
lost
itself
in
the
divine
.
Himself
,
he
said
,
was
Norman
,
Miriam
was
*NL*
Gothic
.
She
bowed
in
consent
even
to
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
he
and
she
went
up
the
great
sweeping
shore
of
sand
towards
*NL*
Theddlethorpe
.
The
long
breakers
plunged
and
ran
in
a
hiss
of
foam
along
*NL*
the
coast
.
It
was
a
warm
evening
.
There
was
not
a
figure
but
themselves
*NL*
on
the
far
reaches
of
sand
,
no
noise
but
the
sound
of
the
sea
.
Paul
*NL*
loved
to
see
it
clanging
at
the
land
.
He
loved
to
feel
himself
between
*NL*
the
noise
of
it
and
the
silence
of
the
sandy
shore
.
Miriam
was
with
him
.
*NL*
Everything
grew
very
intense
.
It
was
quite
dark
when
they
turned
again
.
*NL*
The
way
home
was
through
a
gap
in
the
sandhills
,
and
then
along
a
raised
*NL*
grass
road
between
two
dykes
.
The
country
was
black
and
still
.
From
*NL*
behind
the
sandhills
came
the
whisper
of
the
sea
.
Paul
and
Miriam
walked
*NL*
in
silence
.
Suddenly
he
started
.
The
whole
of
his
blood
seemed
to
burst
*NL*
into
flame
,
and
he
could
scarcely
breathe
.
An
enormous
orange
moon
was
*NL*
staring
at
them
from
the
rim
of
the
sandhills
.
He
stood
still
,
looking
*NL*
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
Miriam
,
when
she
saw
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
perfectly
still
,
staring
at
the
immense
and
ruddy
moon
,
the
*NL*
only
thing
in
the
far-reaching
darkness
of
the
level
.
His
heart
beat
*NL*
heavily
,
the
muscles
of
his
arms
contracted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
murmured
Miriam
,
waiting
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
and
looked
at
her
.
She
stood
beside
him
,
for
ever
in
shadow
.
*NL*
Her
face
,
covered
with
the
darkness
of
her
hat
,
was
watching
him
*NL*
unseen
.
But
she
was
brooding
.
She
was
slightly
afraid
--
deeply
moved
*NL*
and
religious
.
That
was
her
best
state
.
He
was
impotent
against
it
.
His
*NL*
blood
was
concentrated
like
a
flame
in
his
chest
.
But
he
could
not
get
*NL*
across
to
her
.
There
were
flashes
in
his
blood
.
But
somehow
she
ignored
*NL*
them
.
She
was
expecting
some
religious
state
in
him
.
Still
yearning
,
she
*NL*
was
half
aware
of
his
passion
,
and
gazed
at
him
,
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
she
murmured
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
moon
,
''
he
answered
,
frowning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
assented
.
``
Is
n't
it
wonderful
?
''
She
was
curious
about
him
.
*NL*
The
crisis
was
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
himself
what
was
the
matter
.
He
was
naturally
so
young
,
*NL*
and
their
intimacy
was
so
abstract
,
he
did
not
know
he
wanted
to
crush
*NL*
her
on
to
his
breast
to
ease
the
ache
there
.
He
was
afraid
of
her
.
*NL*
The
fact
that
he
might
want
her
as
a
man
wants
a
woman
had
in
him
*NL*
been
suppressed
into
a
shame
.
When
she
shrank
in
her
convulsed
,
coiled
*NL*
torture
from
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
,
he
had
winced
to
the
depths
of
*NL*
his
soul
.
And
now
this
``
purity
''
prevented
even
their
first
love-kiss
.
*NL*
It
was
as
if
she
could
scarcely
stand
the
shock
of
physical
love
,
even
a
*NL*
passionate
kiss
,
and
then
he
was
too
shrinking
and
sensitive
to
give
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
walked
along
the
dark
fen-meadow
he
watched
the
moon
and
did
not
*NL*
speak
.
She
plodded
beside
him
.
He
hated
her
,
for
she
seemed
in
some
way
*NL*
to
make
him
despise
himself
.
Looking
ahead
--
he
saw
the
one
light
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
the
window
of
their
lamp-lit
cottage
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
loved
to
think
of
his
mother
,
and
the
other
jolly
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
everybody
else
has
been
in
long
ago
!
''
said
his
mother
as
they
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
that
matter
!
''
he
cried
irritably
.
``
I
can
go
a
walk
if
I
like
,
*NL*
ca
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
should
have
thought
you
could
get
in
to
supper
with
the
rest
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
please
myself
,
''
he
retorted
.
``
It
's
not
LATE
.
I
shall
do
as
I
*NL*
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
his
mother
cuttingly
,
``
then
DO
as
you
like
.
''
And
she
*NL*
took
no
further
notice
of
him
that
evening
.
Which
he
pretended
neither
*NL*
to
notice
nor
to
care
about
,
but
sat
reading
.
Miriam
read
also
,
*NL*
obliterating
herself
.
Mrs.
Morel
hated
her
for
making
her
son
like
this
.
*NL*
She
watched
Paul
growing
irritable
,
priggish
,
and
melancholic
.
For
this
*NL*
she
put
the
blame
on
Miriam
.
Annie
and
all
her
friends
joined
against
*NL*
the
girl
.
Miriam
had
no
friend
of
her
own
,
only
Paul
.
But
she
did
not
*NL*
suffer
so
much
,
because
she
despised
the
triviality
of
these
other
*NL*
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Paul
hated
her
because
,
somehow
,
she
spoilt
his
ease
and
*NL*
naturalness
.
And
he
writhed
himself
with
a
feeling
of
humiliation
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
STRIFE
IN
LOVE
*NL*
*NL*
ARTHUR
finished
his
apprenticeship
,
and
got
a
job
on
the
electrical
*NL*
plant
at
Minton
Pit
.
He
earned
very
little
,
but
had
a
good
chance
of
*NL*
getting
on
.
But
he
was
wild
and
restless
.
He
did
not
drink
nor
gamble
.
*NL*
Yet
he
somehow
contrived
to
get
into
endless
scrapes
,
always
through
*NL*
some
hot-headed
thoughtlessness
.
Either
he
went
rabbiting
in
the
woods
,
*NL*
like
a
poacher
,
or
he
stayed
in
Nottingham
all
night
instead
of
coming
*NL*
home
,
or
he
miscalculated
his
dive
into
the
canal
at
Bestwood
,
and
*NL*
scored
his
chest
into
one
mass
of
wounds
on
the
raw
stones
and
tins
at
*NL*
the
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
been
at
his
work
many
months
when
again
he
did
not
come
home
*NL*
one
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
Arthur
is
?
''
asked
Paul
at
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
,
''
replied
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
fool
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
And
if
he
DID
anything
I
should
n't
mind
.
But
*NL*
no
,
he
simply
ca
n't
come
away
from
a
game
of
whist
,
or
else
he
must
see
*NL*
a
girl
home
from
the
skating-rink
--
quite
proprietously
--
and
so
ca
n't
get
*NL*
home
.
He
's
a
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
it
would
make
it
any
better
if
he
did
something
to
*NL*
make
us
all
ashamed
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
should
respect
him
more
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
very
much
doubt
it
,
''
said
his
mother
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
on
with
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
fearfully
fond
of
him
?
''
Paul
asked
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
ask
that
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
they
say
a
woman
always
like
the
youngest
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
may
do
--
but
I
do
n't

No
,
he
wearies
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
'd
actually
rather
he
was
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
he
showed
some
of
a
man
's
common
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
raw
and
irritable
.
He
also
wearied
his
mother
very
often
.
She
*NL*
saw
the
sunshine
going
out
of
him
,
and
she
resented
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
were
finishing
breakfast
came
the
postman
with
a
letter
from
*NL*
Derby
.
Mrs.
Morel
screwed
up
her
eyes
to
look
at
the
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
here
,
blind
eye
!
''
exclaimed
her
son
,
snatching
it
away
from
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
,
and
almost
boxed
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
from
your
son
,
Arthur
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
now
--
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
My
dearest
Mother
,
'
''
Paul
read
,
''
'
I
do
n't
know
what
made
me
such
a
*NL*
fool
.
I
want
you
to
come
and
fetch
me
back
from
here
.
I
came
with
Jack
*NL*
Bredon
yesterday
,
instead
of
going
to
work
,
and
enlisted
.
He
said
he
was
*NL*
sick
of
wearing
the
seat
of
a
stool
out
,
and
,
like
the
idiot
you
know
I
*NL*
am
,
I
came
away
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
''

I
have
taken
the
King
's
shilling
,
but
perhaps
if
you
came
for
me
they
*NL*
would
let
me
go
back
with
you
.
I
was
a
fool
when
I
did
it
.
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
be
in
the
army

My
dear
mother

I
am
nothing
but
a
trouble
to
you

*NL*
But
if
you
get
me
out
of
this

I
promise
I
will
have
more
sense
and
*NL*
consideration
...

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
sat
down
in
her
rocking-chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
NOW
,
''
she
cried
,
``
let
him
stop

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
let
him

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
.
The
mother
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
apron
,
*NL*
her
face
set
,
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
'm
not
SICK

she
cried
suddenly
.
``
Sick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
Paul
,
beginning
to
frown
,
``
you

not

worry
your

soul
out
about
this

you
hear

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I

to
take
it
as

she
flashed
,
turning
on
her
*NL*
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
going
to
mount
it
up
to
a
tragedy

so
there

he
retorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
FOOL
!

the
young
fool

''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
look
well
in
uniform

said
Paul
irritatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
turned
on
him
like
a
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
will
he
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Not
in
my
eyes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
should
get
in
a
cavalry
regiment

he
'll
have
the

look
an

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
A

cried
his

stung

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
But
his

had
ceased

listen

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just

on

*NL*
``

nothing

a

makes
movements

when
it
hears
a
shout

It
's
a
fine
thing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca

why
it
upsets
you

said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

perhaps
you
ca

But
I

;
and
she
sat
back
in
her
*NL*
chair
,
her
chin
in
one
hand
,
holding
her
elbow
with
the
other
,
brimmed
*NL*
up
with
wrath
and
chagrin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
shall
you
go
to
Derby
?
''
asked
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
good

*NL*
*NL*

I
'll
see
for
myself

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
on

do
n't
you
let
him
stop

It
's
just
what
he
wants

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
cried
the
mother
,
``
YOU
know
what
he
wants
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
ready
and
went
by
the
first
train
to
Derby
,
where
she
saw
her
*NL*
son
and
the
sergeant
.
It
was
,
however
,
no
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Morel
was
having
his
dinner
in
the
evening
,
she
said
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
to
go
to
Derby
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
miner
turned
up
his
eyes
,
showing
the
whites
in
his
black
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
ter
,
lass

What
took
thee
there
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Arthur

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

an

what
's
agate
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
only
enlisted

''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
put
down
his
knife
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
he
niver
`
as
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
going
down
to
Aldershot
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
exclaimed
the
miner
.
``
That
's
a
winder
.
''
He
considered
it
a
*NL*
moment
,
said
``
H
'm
!
''
and
proceeded
with
his
dinner
.
Suddenly
his
face
*NL*
contracted
with
wrath
.
``
I
hope
he
may
never
set
foot
i
'
my
house
again
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
idea
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
Saying
such
a
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
repeated
Morel
.
``
A
fool
as
runs
away
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fat
sight
you
have
done
as
it
is
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Morel
was
almost
ashamed
to
go
to
his
public-house
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
did
you
go
?
''
said
Paul
to
his
mother
when
he
came
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
could
you
see
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
he
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
blubbered
when
I
came
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
H

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
did
I
,
so
you
need
n't
`
h

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
fretted
after
her
son
.
She
knew
he
would
not
like
the
army
.
*NL*
He
did
not
.
The
discipline
was
intolerable
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
doctor
,
''
she
said
with
some
pride
to
Paul
,
``
said
he
was
*NL*
perfectly
proportioned
--
almost
exactly
;
all
his
measurements
were
*NL*
correct
.
He
IS
good-looking
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
awfully
nice-looking
.
But
he
does
n't
fetch
the
girls
like
William
,
*NL*
does
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
it
's
a
different
character
.
He
's
a
good
deal
like
his
father
,
*NL*
irresponsible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
console
his
mother
,
Paul
did
not
go
much
to
Willey
Farm
at
this
time
.
*NL*
And
in
the
autumn
exhibition
of
students
'
work
in
the
Castle
he
had
two
*NL*
studies
,
a
landscape
in
water-colour
and
a
still
life
in
oil
,
both
of
*NL*
which
had
first-prize
awards
.
He
was
highly
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
I
've
got
for
my
pictures
,
mother
?
''
he
asked
,
coming
*NL*
home
one
evening
.
She
saw
by
his
eyes
he
was
glad
.
Her
face
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
how
should
I
know
,
my
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
first
prize
for
those
glass
jars
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
first
prize
for
that
sketch
up
at
Willey
Farm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rosy
,
bright
look
about
her
,
though
she
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nice
,
''
he
said
,
``
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
praise
me
up
to
the
skies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
the
trouble
of
dragging
you
down
again
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
full
of
joy
,
nevertheless
.
William
had
brought
her
his
*NL*
sporting
trophies
.
She
kept
them
still
,
and
she
did
not
forgive
his
*NL*
death
.
Arthur
was
handsome
--
at
least
,
a
good
specimen
--
and
warm
and
*NL*
generous
,
and
probably
would
do
well
in
the
end
.
But
Paul
was
going
to
*NL*
distinguish
himself
.
She
had
a
great
belief
in
him
,
the
more
because
*NL*
he
was
unaware
of
his
own
powers
.
There
was
so
much
to
come
out
of
him
.
*NL*
Life
for
her
was
rich
with
promise
.
She
was
to
see
herself
fulfilled
.
*NL*
Not
for
nothing
had
been
her
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
times
during
the
exhibition
Mrs.
Morel
went
to
the
Castle
*NL*
unknown
to
Paul
.
She
wandered
down
the
long
room
looking
at
the
other
*NL*
exhibits
.
Yes
,
they
were
good
.
But
they
had
not
in
them
a
certain
*NL*
something
which
she
demanded
for
her
satisfaction
.
Some
made
her
*NL*
jealous
,
they
were
so
good
.
She
looked
at
them
a
long
time
trying
to
*NL*
find
fault
with
them
.
Then
suddenly
she
had
a
shock
that
made
her
heart
*NL*
beat
.
There
hung
Paul
's
picture
!
She
knew
it
as
if
it
were
printed
on
*NL*
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Name
--
Paul
Morel
--
First
Prize
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
looked
so
strange
,
there
in
public
,
on
the
walls
of
the
Castle
*NL*
gallery
,
where
in
her
lifetime
she
had
seen
so
many
pictures
.
And
she
*NL*
glanced
round
to
see
if
anyone
had
noticed
her
again
in
front
of
the
*NL*
same
sketch
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
felt
a
proud
woman
.
When
she
met
well-dressed
ladies
going
home
*NL*
to
the
Park
,
she
thought
to
herself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
look
very
well
--
but
I
wonder
if
YOUR
son
has
two
first
prizes
*NL*
in
the
Castle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
walked
on
,
as
proud
a
little
woman
as
any
in
Nottingham
.
And
*NL*
Paul
felt
he
had
done
something
for
her
,
if
only
a
trifle
.
All
his
work
*NL*
was
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
as
he
was
going
up
Castle
Gate
,
he
met
Miriam
.
He
had
seen
her
*NL*
on
the
Sunday
,
and
had
not
expected
to
meet
her
in
town
.
She
was
walking
*NL*
with
a
rather
striking
woman
,
blonde
,
with
a
sullen
expression
,
and
a
*NL*
defiant
carriage
.
It
was
strange
how
Miriam
,
in
her
bowed
,
meditative
*NL*
bearing
,
looked
dwarfed
beside
this
woman
with
the
handsome
shoulders
.
*NL*
Miriam
watched
Paul
searchingly
.
His
gaze
was
on
the
stranger
,
who
*NL*
ignored
him
.
The
girl
saw
his
masculine
spirit
rear
its
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
he
said
,
``
you
did
n't
tell
me
you
were
coming
to
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Miriam
,
half
apologetically
.
``
I
drove
in
to
Cattle
Market
*NL*
with
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
told
you
about
Mrs.
Dawes
,
''
said
Miriam
huskily
;
she
was
nervous
.
*NL*
``
Clara
,
do
you
know
Paul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
've
seen
him
before
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Dawes
indifferently
,
as
*NL*
she
shook
hands
with
him
.
She
had
scornful
grey
eyes
,
a
skin
like
white
*NL*
honey
,
and
a
full
mouth
,
with
a
slightly
lifted
upper
lip
that
did
not
*NL*
know
whether
it
was
raised
in
scorn
of
all
men
or
out
of
eagerness
to
be
*NL*
kissed
,
but
which
believed
the
former
.
She
carried
her
head
back
,
as
if
*NL*
she
had
drawn
away
in
contempt
,
perhaps
from
men
also
.
She
wore
a
large
,
*NL*
dowdy
hat
of
black
beaver
,
and
a
sort
of
slightly
affected
simple
dress
*NL*
that
made
her
look
rather
sack-like
.
She
was
evidently
poor
,
and
had
not
*NL*
much
taste
.
Miriam
usually
looked
nice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
seen
me
?
''
Paul
asked
of
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
as
if
she
would
not
trouble
to
answer
.
Then
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walking
with
Louie
Travers
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louie
was
one
of
the
``
Spiral
''
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
you
know
her
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
He
turned
to
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Castle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
train
are
you
going
home
by
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
driving
with
father
.
I
wish
you
could
come
too
.
What
time
are
you
*NL*
free
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
not
till
eight
to-night
,
damn
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
directly
the
two
women
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
remembered
that
Clara
Dawes
was
the
daughter
of
an
old
friend
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Leivers
.
Miriam
had
sought
her
out
because
she
had
once
been
Spiral
*NL*
overseer
at
Jordan
's
,
and
because
her
husband
,
Baxter
Dawes
,
was
smith
*NL*
for
the
factory
,
making
the
irons
for
cripple
instruments
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
Through
her
Miriam
felt
she
got
into
direct
contact
with
Jordan
's
,
and
*NL*
could
estimate
better
Paul
's
position
.
But
Mrs.
Dawes
was
separated
from
*NL*
her
husband
,
and
had
taken
up
Women
's
Rights
.
She
was
supposed
to
be
*NL*
clever
.
It
interested
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Baxter
Dawes
he
knew
and
disliked
.
The
smith
was
a
man
of
thirty-one
or
*NL*
thirty-two
.
He
came
occasionally
through
Paul
's
corner
--
a
big
,
well-set
*NL*
man
,
also
striking
to
look
at
,
and
handsome
.
There
was
a
peculiar
*NL*
similarity
between
himself
and
his
wife
.
He
had
the
same
white
skin
,
*NL*
with
a
clear
,
golden
tinge
.
His
hair
was
of
soft
brown
,
his
moustache
*NL*
was
golden
.
And
he
had
a
similar
defiance
in
his
bearing
and
manner
.
But
*NL*
then
came
the
difference
.
His
eyes
,
dark
brown
and
quick-shifting
,
were
*NL*
dissolute
.
They
protruded
very
slightly
,
and
his
eyelids
hung
over
them
*NL*
in
a
way
that
was
half
hate
.
His
mouth
,
too
,
was
sensual
.
His
whole
*NL*
manner
was
of
cowed
defiance
,
as
if
he
were
ready
to
knock
anybody
*NL*
down
who
disapproved
of
him
--
perhaps
because
he
really
disapproved
of
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
first
day
he
had
hated
Paul
.
Finding
the
lad
's
impersonal
,
*NL*
deliberate
gaze
of
an
artist
on
his
face
,
he
got
into
a
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
yer
lookin
'
at
?
''
he
sneered
,
bullying
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
glanced
away
.
But
the
smith
used
to
stand
behind
the
counter
*NL*
and
talk
to
Mr.
Pappleworth
.
His
speech
was
dirty
,
with
a
kind
of
*NL*
rottenness
.
Again
he
found
the
youth
with
his
cool
,
critical
gaze
fixed
*NL*
on
his
face
.
The
smith
started
round
as
if
he
had
been
stung
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
'
r
yer
lookin
'
at
,
three
hap
`
orth
o
'
pap
?
''
he
snarled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
yer
--
!
''
shouted
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
him
alone
,
''
said
Mr.
Pappleworth
,
in
that
insinuating
voice
which
*NL*
means
,
``
He
's
only
one
of
your
good
little
sops
who
ca
n't
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Since
that
time
the
boy
used
to
look
at
the
man
every
time
he
came
*NL*
through
with
the
same
curious
criticism
,
glancing
away
before
he
met
the
*NL*
smith
's
eye
.
It
made
Dawes
furious
.
They
hated
each
other
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
Dawes
had
no
children
.
When
she
had
left
her
husband
the
home
had
*NL*
been
broken
up
,
and
she
had
gone
to
live
with
her
mother
.
Dawes
lodged
*NL*
with
his
sister
.
In
the
same
house
was
a
sister-in-law
,
and
somehow
Paul
*NL*
knew
that
this
girl
,
Louie
Travers
,
was
now
Dawes
's
woman
.
She
was
a
*NL*
handsome
,
insolent
hussy
,
who
mocked
at
the
youth
,
and
yet
flushed
if
he
*NL*
walked
along
to
the
station
with
her
as
she
went
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
time
he
went
to
see
Miriam
it
was
Saturday
evening
.
She
had
*NL*
a
fire
in
the
parlour
,
and
was
waiting
for
him
.
The
others
,
except
her
*NL*
father
and
mother
and
the
young
children
,
had
gone
out
,
so
the
two
had
*NL*
the
parlour
together
.
It
was
a
long
,
low
,
warm
room
.
There
were
three
of
*NL*
Paul
's
small
sketches
on
the
wall
,
and
his
photo
was
on
the
mantelpiece
.
*NL*
On
the
table
and
on
the
high
old
rosewood
piano
were
bowls
of
coloured
*NL*
leaves
.
He
sat
in
the
armchair
,
she
crouched
on
the
hearthrug
near
his
*NL*
feet
.
The
glow
was
warm
on
her
handsome
,
pensive
face
as
she
kneeled
*NL*
there
like
a
devotee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
think
of
Mrs.
Dawes
?
''
she
asked
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
look
very
amiable
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
do
n't
you
think
she
's
a
fine
woman
?
''
she
said
,
in
a
deep
tone
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
in
stature
.
But
without
a
grain
of
taste
.
I
like
her
for
some
*NL*
things
.
IS
she
disagreeable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
.
I
think
she
's
dissatisfied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
how
would
you
like
to
be
tied
for
life
to
a
man
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
she
marry
him
,
then
,
if
she
was
to
have
revulsions
so
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
why
did
she
!
''
repeated
Miriam
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
should
have
thought
she
had
enough
fight
in
her
to
match
him
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
bowed
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
?
''
she
queried
satirically
.
``
What
makes
you
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
her
mouth
--
made
for
passion
--
and
the
very
setback
of
her
*NL*
throat
--
''
He
threw
his
head
back
in
Clara
's
defiant
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
bowed
a
little
lower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
for
some
moments
,
while
he
thought
of
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
were
the
things
you
liked
about
her
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
her
skin
and
the
texture
of
her
--
and
her
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
--
there
's
a
sort
of
fierceness
somewhere
in
her
.
I
appreciate
her
as
*NL*
an
artist
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
why
Miriam
crouched
there
brooding
in
that
strange
way
.
It
*NL*
irritated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
really
like
her
,
do
you
?
''
he
asked
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
with
her
great
,
dazzled
dark
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
--
you
ca
n't
--
not
really
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
?
''
she
asked
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
I
do
n't
know
--
perhaps
you
like
her
because
she
's
got
a
grudge
*NL*
against
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
more
probably
one
of
his
own
reasons
for
liking
Mrs.
Dawes
,
*NL*
but
this
did
not
occur
to
him
.
They
were
silent
.
There
had
come
into
his
*NL*
forehead
a
knitting
of
the
brows
which
was
becoming
habitual
with
him
,
*NL*
particularly
when
he
was
with
Miriam
.
She
longed
to
smooth
it
away
,
and
*NL*
she
was
afraid
of
it
.
It
seemed
the
stamp
of
a
man
who
was
not
her
man
*NL*
in
Paul
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
crimson
berries
among
the
leaves
in
the
bowl
.
He
reached
*NL*
over
and
pulled
out
a
bunch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
put
red
berries
in
your
hair
,
''
he
said
,
``
why
would
you
look
like
*NL*
some
witch
or
priestess
,
and
never
like
a
reveller
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
with
a
naked
,
painful
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
vigorous
warm
hands
were
playing
excitedly
with
the
berries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ca
n't
you
laugh
?
''
he
said
.
``
You
never
laugh
laughter
.
You
only
*NL*
laugh
when
something
is
odd
or
incongruous
,
and
then
it
almost
seems
to
*NL*
hurt
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bowed
her
head
as
if
he
were
scolding
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
could
laugh
at
me
just
for
one
minute
--
just
for
one
minute
.
*NL*
I
feel
as
if
it
would
set
something
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
''
--
and
she
looked
up
at
him
with
eyes
frightened
and
struggling
--
``
I
*NL*
do
laugh
at
you
--
I
DO
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
There
's
always
a
kind
of
intensity
.
When
you
laugh
I
could
*NL*
always
cry
;
it
seems
as
if
it
shows
up
your
suffering
.
Oh
,
you
make
me
*NL*
knit
the
brows
of
my
very
soul
and
cogitate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
she
shook
her
head
despairingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
damned
spiritual
with
YOU
always
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
silent
,
thinking
,
``
Then
why
do
n't
you
be
otherwise
.
''
But
he
*NL*
saw
her
crouching
,
brooding
figure
,
and
it
seemed
to
tear
him
in
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
there
,
it
's
autumn
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
everybody
feels
like
a
*NL*
disembodied
spirit
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
another
silence
.
This
peculiar
sadness
between
them
*NL*
thrilled
her
soul
.
He
seemed
so
beautiful
with
his
eyes
gone
dark
,
and
*NL*
looking
as
if
they
were
deep
as
the
deepest
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
make
me
so
spiritual
!
''
he
lamented
.
``
And
I
do
n't
want
to
be
*NL*
spiritual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
her
finger
from
her
mouth
with
a
little
pop
,
and
looked
up
at
*NL*
him
almost
challenging
.
But
still
her
soul
was
naked
in
her
great
dark
*NL*
eyes
,
and
there
was
the
same
yearning
appeal
upon
her
.
If
he
could
have
*NL*
kissed
her
in
abstract
purity
he
would
have
done
so
.
But
he
could
not
*NL*
kiss
her
thus
--
and
she
seemed
to
leave
no
other
way
.
And
she
yearned
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
a
brief
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
get
that
French
and
we
'll
do
some
--
some
Verlaine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
in
a
deep
tone
,
almost
of
resignation
.
And
she
rose
and
*NL*
got
the
books
.
And
her
rather
red
,
nervous
hands
looked
so
pitiful
,
he
*NL*
was
mad
to
comfort
her
and
kiss
her
.
But
then
be
dared
not
--
or
could
*NL*
not
.
There
was
something
prevented
him
.
His
kisses
were
wrong
for
her
.
*NL*
They
continued
the
reading
till
ten
o'clock
,
when
they
went
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
and
Paul
was
natural
and
jolly
again
with
the
father
and
*NL*
mother
.
His
eyes
were
dark
and
shining
;
there
was
a
kind
of
fascination
*NL*
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
went
into
the
barn
for
his
bicycle
he
found
the
front
wheel
*NL*
punctured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fetch
me
a
drop
of
water
in
a
bowl
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
``
I
shall
be
late
,
*NL*
and
then
I
s
'll
catch
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lighted
the
hurricane
lamp
,
took
off
his
coat
,
turned
up
the
bicycle
,
*NL*
and
set
speedily
to
work
.
Miriam
came
with
the
bowl
of
water
and
stood
*NL*
close
to
him
,
watching
.
She
loved
to
see
his
hands
doing
things
.
He
*NL*
was
slim
and
vigorous
,
with
a
kind
of
easiness
even
in
his
most
hasty
*NL*
movements
.
And
busy
at
his
work
he
seemed
to
forget
her
.
She
loved
*NL*
him
absorbedly
.
She
wanted
to
run
her
hands
down
his
sides
.
She
always
*NL*
wanted
to
embrace
him
,
so
long
as
he
did
not
want
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
he
said
,
rising
suddenly
.
``
Now
,
could
you
have
done
it
*NL*
quicker
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
straightened
himself
.
His
back
was
towards
her
.
She
put
her
two
hands
*NL*
on
his
sides
,
and
ran
them
quickly
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
so
FINE
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
,
hating
her
voice
,
but
his
blood
roused
to
a
wave
of
flame
*NL*
by
her
hands
.
She
did
not
seem
to
realise
HIM
in
all
this
.
He
might
have
*NL*
been
an
object
.
She
never
realised
the
male
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lighted
his
bicycle-lamp
,
bounced
the
machine
on
the
barn
floor
to
*NL*
see
that
the
tyres
were
sound
,
and
buttoned
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
trying
the
brakes
,
that
she
knew
were
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
have
them
mended
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
did
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
back
one
goes
on
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
not
safe

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
use
my
toe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
'd
had
them
mended
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
worry
--
come
to
tea
tomorrow
,
with
Edgar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
--
about
four
.
I
'll
come
to
meet
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
pleased
.
They
went
across
the
dark
yard
to
the
gate
.
Looking
*NL*
across
,
he
saw
through
the
uncurtained
window
of
the
kitchen
the
heads
*NL*
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Leivers
in
the
warm
glow
.
It
looked
very
cosy
.
The
road
,
*NL*
with
pine
trees
,
was
quite
black
in
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Till
tomorrow
,
''
he
said
,
jumping
on
his
bicycle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
take
care
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
she
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
already
came
out
of
the
darkness
.
She
stood
a
moment
watching
*NL*
the
light
from
his
lamp
race
into
obscurity
along
the
ground
.
She
*NL*
turned
very
slowly
indoors
.
Orion
was
wheeling
up
over
the
wood
,
his
dog
*NL*
twinkling
after
him
,
half
smothered
.
For
the
rest
the
world
was
full
of
*NL*
darkness
,
and
silent
,
save
for
the
breathing
of
cattle
in
their
stalls
.
*NL*
She
prayed
earnestly
for
his
safety
that
night
.
When
he
left
her
,
she
*NL*
often
lay
in
anxiety
,
wondering
if
he
had
got
home
safely
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
down
the
hills
on
his
bicycle
.
The
roads
were
greasy
,
so
he
*NL*
had
to
let
it
go
.
He
felt
a
pleasure
as
the
machine
plunged
over
the
*NL*
second
,
steeper
drop
in
the
hill
.
``
Here
goes
!
''
he
said
.
It
was
risky
,
*NL*
because
of
the
curve
in
the
darkness
at
the
bottom
,
and
because
of
the
*NL*
brewers
'
waggons
with
drunken
waggoners
asleep
.
His
bicycle
seemed
*NL*
to
fall
beneath
him
,
and
he
loved
it
.
Recklessness
is
almost
a
man
's
*NL*
revenge
on
his
woman
.
He
feels
he
is
not
valued
,
so
he
will
risk
*NL*
destroying
himself
to
deprive
her
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stars
on
the
lake
seemed
to
leap
like
grasshoppers
,
silver
upon
the
*NL*
blackness
,
as
he
spun
past
.
Then
there
was
the
long
climb
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
mother
!
''
he
said
,
as
he
threw
her
the
berries
and
leaves
on
to
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
she
said
,
glancing
at
them
,
then
away
again
.
She
sat
reading
,
*NL*
alone
,
as
she
always
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
they
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
she
was
cross
with
him
.
After
a
few
minutes
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edgar
and
Miriam
are
coming
to
tea
tomorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
she
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
whether
I
mind
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
you
should
.
I
have
plenty
of
meals
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
you
begrudge
them
tea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
begrudge
whom
tea
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
so
horrid
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
say
no
more
!
You
've
asked
her
to
tea
,
it
's
quite
sufficient
.
She
'll
*NL*
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
angry
with
his
mother
.
He
knew
it
was
merely
Miriam
she
*NL*
objected
to
.
He
flung
off
his
boots
and
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
to
meet
his
friends
the
next
afternoon
.
He
was
glad
to
see
*NL*
them
coming
.
They
arrived
home
at
about
four
o'clock
.
Everywhere
was
*NL*
clean
and
still
for
Sunday
afternoon
.
Mrs.
Morel
sat
in
her
black
dress
*NL*
and
black
apron
.
She
rose
to
meet
the
visitors
.
With
Edgar
she
was
*NL*
cordial
,
but
with
Miriam
cold
and
rather
grudging
.
Yet
Paul
thought
the
*NL*
girl
looked
so
nice
in
her
brown
cashmere
frock
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
helped
his
mother
to
get
the
tea
ready
.
Miriam
would
have
gladly
*NL*
proffered
,
but
was
afraid
.
He
was
rather
proud
of
his
home
.
There
was
*NL*
about
it
now
,
he
thought
,
a
certain
distinction
.
The
chairs
were
only
*NL*
wooden
,
and
the
sofa
was
old
.
But
the
hearthrug
and
cushions
were
*NL*
cosy
;
the
pictures
were
prints
in
good
taste
;
there
was
a
simplicity
in
*NL*
everything
,
and
plenty
of
books
.
He
was
never
ashamed
in
the
least
of
*NL*
his
home
,
nor
was
Miriam
of
hers
,
because
both
were
what
they
should
be
,
*NL*
and
warm
.
And
then
he
was
proud
of
the
table
;
the
china
was
pretty
,
the
*NL*
cloth
was
fine
.
It
did
not
matter
that
the
spoons
were
not
silver
nor
*NL*
the
knives
ivory-handled
;
everything
looked
nice
.
Mrs.
Morel
had
managed
*NL*
wonderfully
while
her
children
were
growing
up
,
so
that
nothing
was
out
*NL*
of
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
talked
books
a
little
.
That
was
her
unfailing
topic
.
But
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
was
not
cordial
,
and
turned
soon
to
Edgar
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Edgar
and
Miriam
used
to
go
into
Mrs.
Morel
's
pew
.
Morel
never
*NL*
went
to
chapel
,
preferring
the
public-house
.
Mrs.
Morel
,
like
a
little
*NL*
champion
,
sat
at
the
head
of
her
pew
,
Paul
at
the
other
end
;
and
at
*NL*
first
Miriam
sat
next
to
him
.
Then
the
chapel
was
like
home
.
It
was
a
*NL*
pretty
place
,
with
dark
pews
and
slim
,
elegant
pillars
,
and
flowers
.
And
*NL*
the
same
people
had
sat
in
the
same
places
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
.
It
*NL*
was
wonderfully
sweet
and
soothing
to
sit
there
for
an
hour
and
a
half
,
*NL*
next
to
Miriam
,
and
near
to
his
mother
,
uniting
his
two
loves
under
the
*NL*
spell
of
the
place
of
worship
.
Then
he
felt
warm
and
happy
and
religious
*NL*
at
once
.
And
after
chapel
he
walked
home
with
Miriam
,
whilst
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
with
her
old
friend
,
Mrs.
Burns
.
He
was
*NL*
keenly
alive
on
his
walks
on
Sunday
nights
with
Edgar
and
Miriam
.
He
*NL*
never
went
past
the
pits
at
night
,
by
the
lighted
lamp-house
,
the
tall
*NL*
black
headstocks
and
lines
of
trucks
,
past
the
fans
spinning
slowly
like
*NL*
shadows
,
without
the
feeling
of
Miriam
returning
to
him
,
keen
and
almost
*NL*
unbearable
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
very
long
occupy
the
Morels
'
pew
.
Her
father
took
one
for
*NL*
themselves
once
more
.
It
was
under
the
little
gallery
,
opposite
the
*NL*
Morels
'
.
When
Paul
and
his
mother
came
in
the
chapel
the
Leivers
's
pew
*NL*
was
always
empty
.
He
was
anxious
for
fear
she
would
not
come
:
it
was
so
*NL*
far
,
and
there
were
so
many
rainy
Sundays
.
Then
,
often
very
late
indeed
,
*NL*
she
came
in
,
with
her
long
stride
,
her
head
bowed
,
her
face
hidden
under
*NL*
her
hat
of
dark
green
velvet
.
Her
face
,
as
she
sat
opposite
,
was
always
*NL*
in
shadow
.
But
it
gave
him
a
very
keen
feeling
,
as
if
all
his
soul
*NL*
stirred
within
him
,
to
see
her
there
.
It
was
not
the
same
glow
,
*NL*
happiness
,
and
pride
,
that
he
felt
in
having
his
mother
in
charge
:
*NL*
something
more
wonderful
,
less
human
,
and
tinged
to
intensity
by
a
pain
,
*NL*
as
if
there
were
something
he
could
not
get
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
he
was
beginning
to
question
the
orthodox
creed
.
He
was
*NL*
twenty-one
,
and
she
was
twenty
.
She
was
beginning
to
dread
the
spring
:
*NL*
he
became
so
wild
,
and
hurt
her
so
much
.
All
the
way
he
went
cruelly
*NL*
smashing
her
beliefs
.
Edgar
enjoyed
it
.
He
was
by
nature
critical
and
*NL*
rather
dispassionate
.
But
Miriam
suffered
exquisite
pain
,
as
,
with
an
*NL*
intellect
like
a
knife
,
the
man
she
loved
examined
her
religion
in
which
*NL*
she
lived
and
moved
and
had
her
being
.
But
he
did
not
spare
her
.
He
was
*NL*
cruel
.
And
when
they
went
alone
he
was
even
more
fierce
,
as
if
he
would
*NL*
kill
her
soul
.
He
bled
her
beliefs
till
she
almost
lost
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
exults
--
she
exults
as
she
carries
him
off
from
me
,
''
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
cried
in
her
heart
when
Paul
had
gone
.
``
She
's
not
like
an
ordinary
*NL*
woman
,
who
can
leave
me
my
share
in
him
.
She
wants
to
absorb
him
.
She
*NL*
wants
to
draw
him
out
and
absorb
him
till
there
is
nothing
left
of
him
,
*NL*
even
for
himself
.
He
will
never
be
a
man
on
his
own
feet
--
she
will
suck
*NL*
him
up
.
''
So
the
mother
sat
,
and
battled
and
brooded
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
,
coming
home
from
his
walks
with
Miriam
,
was
wild
with
torture
.
*NL*
He
walked
biting
his
lips
and
with
clenched
fists
,
going
at
a
great
*NL*
rate
.
Then
,
brought
up
against
a
stile
,
he
stood
for
some
minutes
,
and
*NL*
did
not
move
.
There
was
a
great
hollow
of
darkness
fronting
him
,
and
on
*NL*
the
black
upslopes
patches
of
tiny
lights
,
and
in
the
lowest
trough
of
*NL*
the
night
,
a
flare
of
the
pit
.
It
was
all
weird
and
dreadful
.
Why
was
he
*NL*
torn
so
,
almost
bewildered
,
and
unable
to
move
?
Why
did
his
mother
sit
*NL*
at
home
and
suffer
?
He
knew
she
suffered
badly
.
But
why
should
she
?
And
*NL*
why
did
he
hate
Miriam
,
and
feel
so
cruel
towards
her
,
at
the
thought
*NL*
of
his
mother
.
If
Miriam
caused
his
mother
suffering
,
then
he
hated
*NL*
her
--
and
he
easily
hated
her
.
Why
did
she
make
him
feel
as
if
he
were
*NL*
uncertain
of
himself
,
insecure
,
an
indefinite
thing
,
as
if
he
had
not
*NL*
sufficient
sheathing
to
prevent
the
night
and
the
space
breaking
into
*NL*
him
?
How
he
hated
her
!
And
then
,
what
a
rush
of
tenderness
and
humility
!
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
plunged
on
again
,
running
home
.
His
mother
saw
on
him
the
*NL*
marks
of
some
agony
,
and
she
said
nothing
.
But
he
had
to
make
her
talk
*NL*
to
him
.
Then
she
was
angry
with
him
for
going
so
far
with
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
like
her
,
mother
?
''
he
cried
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
my
boy
,
''
she
replied
piteously
.
``
I
'm
sure
I
've
tried
to
*NL*
like
her
.
I
've
tried
and
tried
,
but
I
ca
n't
--
I
ca
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
felt
dreary
and
hopeless
between
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
was
the
worst
time
.
He
was
changeable
,
and
intense
and
cruel
.
*NL*
So
he
decided
to
stay
away
from
her
.
Then
came
the
hours
when
he
knew
*NL*
Miriam
was
expecting
him
.
His
mother
watched
him
growing
restless
.
*NL*
He
could
not
go
on
with
his
work
.
He
could
do
nothing
.
It
was
as
if
*NL*
something
were
drawing
his
soul
out
towards
Willey
Farm
.
Then
he
put
on
*NL*
his
hat
and
went
,
saying
nothing
.
And
his
mother
knew
he
was
gone
.
And
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
was
on
the
way
he
sighed
with
relief
.
And
when
he
was
with
*NL*
her
he
was
cruel
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
in
March
he
lay
on
the
bank
of
Nethermere
,
with
Miriam
sitting
*NL*
beside
him
.
It
was
a
glistening
,
white-and-blue
day
.
Big
clouds
,
so
*NL*
brilliant
,
went
by
overhead
,
while
shadows
stole
along
on
the
water
.
The
*NL*
clear
spaces
in
the
sky
were
of
clean
,
cold
blue
.
Paul
lay
on
his
back
*NL*
in
the
old
grass
,
looking
up
.
He
could
not
bear
to
look
at
Miriam
.
She
*NL*
seemed
to
want
him
,
and
he
resisted
.
He
resisted
all
the
time
.
He
wanted
*NL*
now
to
give
her
passion
and
tenderness
,
and
he
could
not
.
He
felt
that
*NL*
she
wanted
the
soul
out
of
his
body
,
and
not
him
.
All
his
strength
and
*NL*
energy
she
drew
into
herself
through
some
channel
which
united
them
.
She
*NL*
did
not
want
to
meet
him
,
so
that
there
were
two
of
them
,
man
and
woman
*NL*
together
.
She
wanted
to
draw
all
of
him
into
her
.
It
urged
him
to
an
*NL*
intensity
like
madness
,
which
fascinated
him
,
as
drug-taking
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
discussing
Michael
Angelo
.
It
felt
to
her
as
if
she
were
*NL*
fingering
the
very
quivering
tissue
,
the
very
protoplasm
of
life
,
as
*NL*
she
heard
him
.
It
gave
her
deepest
satisfaction
.
And
in
the
end
it
*NL*
frightened
her
.
There
he
lay
in
the
white
intensity
of
his
search
,
*NL*
and
his
voice
gradually
filled
her
with
fear
,
so
level
it
was
,
almost
*NL*
inhuman
,
as
if
in
a
trance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
talk
any
more
,
''
she
pleaded
softly
,
laying
her
hand
on
his
*NL*
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
quite
still
,
almost
unable
to
move
.
His
body
was
somewhere
*NL*
discarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
Are
you
tired
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
it
wears
you
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
shortly
,
realising
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
always
make
me
like
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wish
to
,
''
she
said
,
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
when
you
've
gone
too
far
,
and
you
feel
you
ca
n't
bear
it
.
But
your
*NL*
unconscious
self
always
asks
it
of
me
.
And
I
suppose
I
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
,
in
his
dead
fashion
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
only
you
could
want
ME
,
and
not
want
what
I
can
reel
off
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
!
''
she
cried
bitterly
--
``
I
!
Why
,
when
would
you
let
me
take
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
's
my
fault
,
''
he
said
,
and
,
gathering
himself
together
,
he
got
*NL*
up
and
began
to
talk
trivialities
.
He
felt
insubstantial
.
In
a
vague
way
*NL*
he
hated
her
for
it
.
And
he
knew
he
was
as
much
to
blame
himself
.
This
,
*NL*
however
,
did
not
prevent
his
hating
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
about
this
time
he
had
walked
along
the
home
road
with
her
.
*NL*
They
stood
by
the
pasture
leading
down
to
the
wood
,
unable
to
part
.
As
*NL*
the
stars
came
out
the
clouds
closed
.
They
had
glimpses
of
their
own
*NL*
constellation
,
Orion
,
towards
the
west
.
His
jewels
glimmered
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
his
dog
ran
low
,
struggling
with
difficulty
through
the
spume
of
*NL*
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Orion
was
for
them
chief
in
significance
among
the
constellations
.
They
*NL*
had
gazed
at
him
in
their
strange
,
surcharged
hours
of
feeling
,
until
*NL*
they
seemed
themselves
to
live
in
every
one
of
his
stars
.
This
evening
*NL*
Paul
had
been
moody
and
perverse
.
Orion
had
seemed
just
an
ordinary
*NL*
constellation
to
him
.
He
had
fought
against
his
glamour
and
fascination
.
*NL*
Miriam
was
watching
her
lover
's
mood
carefully
.
But
he
said
nothing
*NL*
that
gave
him
away
,
till
the
moment
came
to
part
,
when
he
stood
frowning
*NL*
gloomily
at
the
gathered
clouds
,
behind
which
the
great
constellation
*NL*
must
be
striding
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
to
be
a
little
party
at
his
house
the
next
day
,
at
which
she
*NL*
was
to
attend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
come
and
meet
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
;
it
's
not
very
nice
out
,
''
she
replied
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
that
--
only
they
do
n't
like
me
to
.
They
say
I
care
more
for
*NL*
you
than
for
them
.
And
you
understand
,
do
n't
you
?
You
know
it
's
only
*NL*
friendship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
was
astonished
and
hurt
for
him
.
It
had
cost
him
an
effort
.
She
*NL*
left
him
,
wanting
to
spare
him
any
further
humiliation
.
A
fine
rain
blew
*NL*
in
her
face
as
she
walked
along
the
road
.
She
was
hurt
deep
down
;
and
*NL*
she
despised
him
for
being
blown
about
by
any
wind
of
authority
.
And
in
*NL*
her
heart
of
hearts
,
unconsciously
,
she
felt
that
he
was
trying
to
get
*NL*
away
from
her
.
This
she
would
never
have
acknowledged
.
She
pitied
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
Paul
became
an
important
factor
in
Jordan
's
warehouse
.
Mr.
*NL*
Pappleworth
left
to
set
up
a
business
of
his
own
,
and
Paul
remained
with
*NL*
Mr.
Jordan
as
Spiral
overseer
.
His
wages
were
to
be
raised
to
thirty
*NL*
shillings
at
the
year-end
,
if
things
went
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
on
Friday
night
Miriam
often
came
down
for
her
French
lesson
.
Paul
*NL*
did
not
go
so
frequently
to
Willey
Farm
,
and
she
grieved
at
the
thought
*NL*
of
her
education
's
coming
to
end
;
moreover
,
they
both
loved
to
*NL*
be
together
,
in
spite
of
discords
.
So
they
read
Balzac
,
and
did
*NL*
compositions
,
and
felt
highly
cultured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Friday
night
was
reckoning
night
for
the
miners
.
Morel
*NL*
``
reckoned
''
--
shared
up
the
money
of
the
stall
--
either
in
the
New
Inn
*NL*
at
Bretty
or
in
his
own
house
,
according
as
his
fellow-butties
wished
.
*NL*
Barker
had
turned
a
non-drinker
,
so
now
the
men
reckoned
at
Morel
's
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
,
who
had
been
teaching
away
,
was
at
home
again
.
She
was
still
a
*NL*
tomboy
;
and
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
.
Paul
was
studying
design
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
was
always
in
good
spirits
on
Friday
evening
,
unless
the
week
's
*NL*
earnings
were
small
.
He
bustled
immediately
after
his
dinner
,
prepared
*NL*
to
get
washed
.
It
was
decorum
for
the
women
to
absent
themselves
while
*NL*
the
men
reckoned
.
Women
were
not
supposed
to
spy
into
such
a
masculine
*NL*
privacy
as
the
butties
'
reckoning
,
nor
were
they
to
know
the
exact
*NL*
amount
of
the
week
's
earnings
.
So
,
whilst
her
father
was
spluttering
*NL*
in
the
scullery
,
Annie
went
out
to
spend
an
hour
with
a
neighbour
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
attended
to
her
baking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
that
doo-er
!
''
bawled
Morel
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
banged
it
behind
her
,
and
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
tha
oppens
it
again
while
I
'm
weshin
'
me
,
I
'll
ma'e
thy
jaw
rattle
,
''
*NL*
he
threatened
from
the
midst
of
his
soap-suds
.
Paul
and
the
mother
*NL*
frowned
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
he
came
running
out
of
the
scullery
,
with
the
soapy
water
*NL*
dripping
from
him
,
dithering
with
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
sirs
!
''
he
said
.
``
Wheer
's
my
towel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
hung
on
a
chair
to
warm
before
the
fire
,
otherwise
he
would
*NL*
have
bullied
and
blustered
.
He
squatted
on
his
heels
before
the
hot
*NL*
baking-fire
to
dry
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
F-ff-f
!
''
he
went
,
pretending
to
shudder
with
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
,
man
,
do
n't
be
such
a
kid
!
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
It
's
NOT
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thee
strip
thysen
stark
nak
'd
to
wesh
thy
flesh
i
'
that
scullery
,
''
said
*NL*
the
miner
,
as
he
rubbed
his
hair
;
``
nowt
b
'
r
a
ice
-
`
ouse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
should
n't
make
that
fuss
,
''
replied
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
tha
'd
drop
down
stiff
,
as
dead
as
a
door-knob
,
wi

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
a
door-knob
deader
than
anything
else
?
''
asked
Paul
,
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
I
dunno
;
that
's
what
they
say
,
''
replied
his
father
.
``
But
there
's
*NL*
that
much
draught
i
'
yon
scullery
,
as
it
blows
through
your
ribs
like
*NL*
through
a
five-barred
gate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
some
difficulty
in
blowing
through
yours
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
looked
down
ruefully
at
his
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
I
'm
nowt
b
'
r
a
skinned
rabbit
.
My
bones
fair
juts
*NL*
out
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
know
where
,
''
retorted
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iv
`
ry-wheer
!
I
'm
nobbut
a
sack
o
'
faggots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
laughed
.
He
had
still
a
wonderfully
young
body
,
muscular
,
*NL*
without
any
fat
.
His
skin
was
smooth
and
clear
.
It
might
have
been
the
*NL*
body
of
a
man
of
twenty-eight
,
except
that
there
were
,
perhaps
,
too
many
*NL*
blue
scars
,
like
tattoo-marks
,
where
the
coal-dust
remained
under
the
*NL*
skin
,
and
that
his
chest
was
too
hairy
.
But
he
put
his
hand
on
his
side
*NL*
ruefully
.
It
was
his
fixed
belief
that
,
because
he
did
not
get
fat
,
*NL*
he
was
as
thin
as
a
starved
rat
.
Paul
looked
at
his
father
's
thick
,
*NL*
brownish
hands
all
scarred
,
with
broken
nails
,
rubbing
the
fine
*NL*
smoothness
of
his
sides
,
and
the
incongruity
struck
him
.
It
seemed
*NL*
strange
they
were
the
same
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
''
he
said
to
his
father
,
``
you
had
a
good
figure
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
''
exclaimed
the
miner
,
glancing
round
,
startled
and
timid
,
like
a
*NL*
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
,
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
if
he
did
n't
hurtle
himself
up
as
if
he
*NL*
was
trying
to
get
in
the
smallest
space
he
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
''
exclaimed
Morel
--
``
me
a
good
figure
!
I
wor
niver
much
more
n
'
r
a
*NL*
skeleton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
!
''
cried
his
wife
,
``
do
n't
be
such
a
pulamiter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Strewth
!
''
he
said
.
``
Tha
's
niver
knowed
me
but
what
I
looked
as
if
I
*NL*
wor
goin
'
off
in
a
rapid
decline
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
had
a
constitution
like
iron
,
''
she
said
;
``
and
never
a
man
had
a
*NL*
better
start
,
if
it
was
body
that
counted
.
You
should
have
seen
him
as
*NL*
a
young
man
,
''
she
cried
suddenly
to
Paul
,
drawing
herself
up
to
imitate
*NL*
her
husband
's
once
handsome
bearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
watched
her
shyly
.
He
saw
again
the
passion
she
had
had
for
him
.
*NL*
It
blazed
upon
her
for
a
moment
.
He
was
shy
,
rather
scared
,
and
humble
.
*NL*
Yet
again
he
felt
his
old
glow
.
And
then
immediately
he
felt
the
ruin
he
*NL*
had
made
during
these
years
.
He
wanted
to
bustle
about
,
to
run
away
from
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gi'e
my
back
a
bit
of
a
wesh
,
''
he
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
brought
a
well-soaped
flannel
and
clapped
it
on
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
He
gave
a
jump
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
tha
mucky
little
`
ussy
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Cowd
as
death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
been
a
salamander
,
''
she
laughed
,
washing
his
back
.
It
*NL*
was
very
rarely
she
would
do
anything
so
personal
for
him
.
The
children
*NL*
did
those
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
world
wo
n't
be
half
hot
enough
for
you
,
''
she
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
;
``
tha
`
lt
see
as
it
's
draughty
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
had
finished
.
She
wiped
him
in
a
desultory
fashion
,
and
went
*NL*
upstairs
,
returning
immediately
with
his
shifting-trousers
.
When
he
was
*NL*
dried
he
struggled
into
his
shirt
.
Then
,
ruddy
and
shiny
,
with
hair
on
*NL*
end
,
and
his
flannelette
shirt
hanging
over
his
pit-trousers
,
he
stood
*NL*
warming
the
garments
he
was
going
to
put
on
.
He
turned
them
,
he
pulled
*NL*
them
inside
out
,
he
scorched
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
,
man
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
get
dressed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
thee
like
to
clap
thysen
into
britches
as
cowd
as
a
tub
o
'
*NL*
water
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
took
off
his
pit-trousers
and
donned
decent
black
.
He
did
all
*NL*
this
on
the
hearthrug
,
as
he
would
have
done
if
Annie
and
her
familiar
*NL*
friends
had
been
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
turned
the
bread
in
the
oven
.
Then
from
the
red
earthenware
*NL*
panchion
of
dough
that
stood
in
a
corner
she
took
another
handful
of
*NL*
paste
,
worked
it
to
the
proper
shape
,
and
dropped
it
into
a
tin
.
As
she
*NL*
was
doing
so
Barker
knocked
and
entered
.
He
was
a
quiet
,
compact
little
*NL*
man
,
who
looked
as
if
he
would
go
through
a
stone
wall
.
His
black
hair
*NL*
was
cropped
short
,
his
head
was
bony
.
Like
most
miners
,
he
was
pale
,
but
*NL*
healthy
and
taut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Evenin
'
,
missis
,
''
he
nodded
to
Mrs.
Morel
,
and
he
seated
himself
with
a
*NL*
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-evening
,
''
she
replied
cordially
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
's
made
thy
heels
crack
,
''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dunno
as
I
have
,
''
said
Barker
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
,
as
the
men
always
did
in
Morel
's
kitchen
,
effacing
himself
*NL*
rather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
missis
?
''
she
asked
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
told
her
some
time
back
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
expectin
'
us

just
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
he
answered
,
rubbing
his
head
,
``

,
I
*NL*
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let

''
asked
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
should

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

And
she

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
've

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
knew
Barker
would
n't
do
anything
very
silly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

She
saw
the
determined
little
collier
buying
in
the
week
's
groceries
and
*NL*
meat
on
the
Friday
nights
,
and
she
admired
him
.
``
Barker
's
little
,
but
*NL*
he
's
ten
times
the
man
you
are
,
''
she
said
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
Wesson
entered
.
He
was
thin
,
rather
frail-looking
,
with
a
*NL*
boyish
ingenuousness
and
a
slightly
foolish
smile
,
despite
his
seven
*NL*
children
.
But
his
wife
was
a
passionate
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
've
kested
me
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
rather
vapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Barker
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
newcomer
took
off
his
cap
and
his
big
woollen
muffler
.
His
nose
was
*NL*
pointed
and
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
you
're
cold
,
Mr.
Wesson
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
bit
nippy
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
come
to
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
I
s
'll
do
where
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
colliers
sat
away
back
.
They
could
not
be
induced
to
come
on
to
the
*NL*
hearth
.
The
hearth
is
sacred
to
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
thy
ways
i
'
th
'
armchair
,
''
cried
Morel
cheerily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
thank
yer
;
I
'm
very
nicely
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
come
,
of
course
,
''
insisted
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
and
went
awkwardly
.
He
sat
in
Morel
's
armchair
awkwardly
.
It
was
*NL*
too
great
a
familiarity
.
But
the
fire
made
him
blissfully
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
's
that
chest
of
yours
?
''
demanded
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
again
,
with
his
blue
eyes
rather
sunny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
very
middlin
'
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wi
'
a
rattle
in
it
like
a
kettle-drum
,
''
said
Barker
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
T-t-t-t
!
''
went
Mrs.
Morel
rapidly
with
her
tongue
.
``
Did
you
have
that
*NL*
flannel
singlet
made
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
''
he
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
why
did
n't
you
?
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
come
,
''
he
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
an
'
Doomsday
!
''
exclaimed
Barker
.
*NL*
*NL*
Barker
and
Morel
were
both
impatient
of
Wesson
.
But
,
then
,
they
were
*NL*
both
as
hard
as
nails
,
physically
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Morel
was
nearly
ready
he
pushed
the
bag
of
money
to
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
it
,
boy
,
''
he
asked
humbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
impatiently
turned
from
his
books
and
pencil
,
tipped
the
bag
upside
*NL*
down
on
the
table
.
There
was
a
five-pound
bag
of
silver
,
sovereigns
and
*NL*
loose
money
.
He
counted
quickly
,
referred
to
the
checks
--
the
written
*NL*
papers
giving
amount
of
coal
--
put
the
money
in
order
.
Then
Barker
*NL*
glanced
at
the
checks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
went
upstairs
,
and
the
three
men
came
to
table
.
Morel
,
as
*NL*
master
of
the
house
,
sat
in
his
armchair
,
with
his
back
to
the
hot
fire
.
*NL*
The
two
butties
had
cooler
seats
.
None
of
them
counted
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
we
say
Simpson
's
was
?
''
asked
Morel
;
and
the
butties
cavilled
*NL*
for
a
minute
over
the
dayman
's
earnings
.
Then
the
amount
was
put
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
Bill
Naylor
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
money
also
was
taken
from
the
pack
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
because
Wesson
lived
in
one
of
the
company
's
houses
,
and
his
rent
*NL*
had
been
deducted
,
Morel
and
Barker
took
four-and-six
each
.
And
because
*NL*
Morel
's
coals
had
come
,
and
the
leading
was
stopped
,
Barker
and
Wesson
*NL*
took
four
shillings
each
.
Then
it
was
plain
sailing
.
Morel
gave
each
of
*NL*
them
a
sovereign
till
there
were
no
more
sovereigns
;
each
half
a
crown
*NL*
till
there
were
no
more
half-crowns
;
each
a
shilling
till
there
were
no
*NL*
more
shillings
.
If
there
was
anything
at
the
end
that
would
n't
split
,
*NL*
Morel
took
it
and
stood
drinks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
three
men
rose
and
went
.
Morel
scuttled
out
of
the
house
before
*NL*
his
wife
came
down
.
She
heard
the
door
close
,
and
descended
.
She
looked
*NL*
hastily
at
the
bread
in
the
oven
.
Then
,
glancing
on
the
table
,
she
saw
*NL*
her
money
lying
.
Paul
had
been
working
all
the
time
.
But
now
he
felt
his
*NL*
mother
counting
the
week
's
money
,
and
her
wrath
rising
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
T-t-t-t-t
!
''
went
her
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
.
He
could
not
work
when
she
was
cross
.
She
counted
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
measly
twenty-five
shillings
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
How
much
was
the
*NL*
cheque
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
pounds
eleven
,
''
said
Paul
irritably
.
He
dreaded
what
was
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
gives
me
a
scrattlin
'
twenty-five
,
an
'
his
club
this
week
!
But
I
*NL*
know
him
.
He
thinks
because
YOU
'RE
earning
he
need
n't
keep
the
house
any
*NL*
longer
.
No
,
all
he
has
to
do
with
his
money
is
to
guttle
it
.
But
I
'll
*NL*
show
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mother
,
do
n't
!
''
cried
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
what
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
carry
on
again
.
I
ca
n't
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
very
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
all
very
well
,
''
she
said
;
``
but
how
do
you
think
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
manage
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
wo
n't
make
it
any
better
to
whittle
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
know
what
you
'd
do
if
you
had
it
to
put
up
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
be
long
.
You
can
have
my
money
.
Let
him
go
to
hell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
to
his
work
,
and
she
tied
her
bonnet-strings
grimly
.
When
*NL*
she
was
fretted
he
could
not
bear
it
.
But
now
he
began
to
insist
on
her
*NL*
recognizing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
two
loaves
at
the
top
,
''
she
said
,
``
will
be
done
in
twenty
minutes
.
*NL*
Do
n't
forget
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
answered
;
and
she
went
to
market
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
alone
working
.
But
his
usual
intense
concentration
became
*NL*
unsettled
.
He
listened
for
the
yard-gate
.
At
a
quarter-past
seven
came
a
*NL*
low
knock
,
and
Miriam
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
alone
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
at
home
,
she
took
off
her
tam-o
'
-
shanter
and
her
long
coat
,
*NL*
hanging
them
up
.
It
gave
him
a
thrill
.
This
might
be
their
own
house
,
*NL*
his
and
hers
.
Then
she
came
back
and
peered
over
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
design
,
for
decorating
stuffs
,
and
for
embroidery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bent
short-sightedly
over
the
drawings
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
irritated
him
that
she
peered
so
into
everything
that
was
his
,
*NL*
searching
him
out
.
He
went
into
the
parlour
and
returned
with
a
bundle
*NL*
of
brownish
linen
.
Carefully
unfolding
it
,
he
spread
it
on
the
floor
.
It
*NL*
proved
to
be
a
curtain
or
portiere
,
beautifully
stencilled
with
a
design
*NL*
on
roses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
how
beautiful
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spread
cloth
,
with
its
wonderful
reddish
roses
and
dark
green
stems
,
*NL*
all
so
simple
,
and
somehow
so
wicked-looking
,
lay
at
her
feet
.
She
went
*NL*
on
her
knees
before
it
,
her
dark
curls
dropping
.
He
saw
her
crouched
*NL*
voluptuously
before
his
work
,
and
his
heart
beat
quickly
.
Suddenly
she
*NL*
looked
up
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
it
seem
cruel
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
seems
a
feeling
of
cruelty
about
it
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
jolly
good
,
whether
or
not
,
''
he
replied
,
folding
up
his
work
with
*NL*
a
lover
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
slowly
,
pondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
will
you
do
with
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
it
to
Liberty
's
.
I
did
it
for
my
mother
,
but
I
think
she
'd
rather
*NL*
have
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Miriam
.
He
had
spoken
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
,
and
Miriam
*NL*
sympathised
.
Money
would
have
been
nothing
to
HER
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
cloth
back
into
the
parlour
.
When
he
returned
he
threw
to
*NL*
Miriam
a
smaller
piece
.
It
was
a
cushion-cover
with
the
same
design
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
that
for
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fingered
the
work
with
trembling
hands
,
and
did
not
speak
.
He
became
*NL*
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
,
the
bread
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
top
loaves
out
,
tapped
them
vigorously
.
They
were
done
.
He
*NL*
put
them
on
the
hearth
to
cool
.
Then
he
went
to
the
scullery
,
wetted
his
*NL*
hands
,
scooped
the
last
white
dough
out
of
the
punchion
,
and
dropped
it
*NL*
in
a
baking-tin
.
Miriam
was
still
bent
over
her
painted
cloth
.
He
stood
*NL*
rubbing
the
bits
of
dough
from
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
like
it
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
at
him
,
with
her
dark
eyes
one
flame
of
love
.
He
laughed
*NL*
uncomfortably
.
Then
he
began
to
talk
about
the
design
.
There
was
for
him
*NL*
the
most
intense
pleasure
in
talking
about
his
work
to
Miriam
.
All
his
*NL*
passion
,
all
his
wild
blood
,
went
into
this
intercourse
with
her
,
*NL*
when
he
talked
and
conceived
his
work
.
She
brought
forth
to
him
his
*NL*
imaginations
.
She
did
not
understand
,
any
more
than
a
woman
understands
*NL*
when
she
conceives
a
child
in
her
womb
.
But
this
was
life
for
her
and
*NL*
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
talking
,
a
young
woman
of
about
twenty-two
,
small
and
*NL*
pale
,
hollow-eyed
,
yet
with
a
relentless
look
about
her
,
entered
the
*NL*
room
.
She
was
a
friend
at
the
Morel
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
your
things
off
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
not
stopping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
in
the
armchair
opposite
Paul
and
Miriam
,
who
were
on
the
*NL*
sofa
.
Miriam
moved
a
little
farther
from
him
.
The
room
was
hot
,
with
a
*NL*
scent
of
new
bread
.
Brown
,
crisp
loaves
stood
on
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
have
expected
to
see
you
here
to-night
,
Miriam
Leivers
,
''
*NL*
said
Beatrice
wickedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
murmured
Miriam
huskily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
let
's
look
at
your
shoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
remained
uncomfortably
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
tha
doesna
tha
durs
`
na
,
''
laughed
Beatrice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
put
her
feet
from
under
her
dress
.
Her
boots
had
that
queer
,
*NL*
irresolute
,
rather
pathetic
look
about
them
,
which
showed
how
*NL*
self-conscious
and
self-mistrustful
she
was
.
And
they
were
covered
with
*NL*
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glory
!
You
're
a
positive
muck-heap
,
''
exclaimed
Beatrice
.
``
Who
cleans
*NL*
your
boots
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
clean
them
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
wanted
a
job
,
''
said
Beatrice
.
``
It
would
ha
'
taken
a
lot
of
men
*NL*
to
ha
'
brought
me
down
here
to-night
.
But
love
laughs
at
sludge
,
does
n't
*NL*

Postle

duck

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inter
alia
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Lord
!
are
you
going
to
spout
foreign
languages
?
What
does
it
mean

*NL*
Miriam

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
fine
sarcasm
in
the
last
question
,
but
Miriam
did
not
see
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Among
other
things
,

I
believe

''
she
said
humbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beatrice
put
her
tongue
between
her
teeth
and
laughed
wickedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Among
other
things

`
Postle

she
repeated
.
``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
She
affected
a
great
innocence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
fact
,
it
's
one
big
smile

''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
its

`
Postle

you
believe
me
,
''
she
said
;
and
she
went
*NL*
off
into
another
burst
of
wicked
,
silent
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
sat
silent
,
withdrawn
into
herself
.
Every
one
of
Paul
's
*NL*
friends
delighted
in
taking
sides
against
her
,
and
he
left
her
in
the
*NL*
lurch
--
seemed
almost
to
have
a
sort
of
revenge
upon
her
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
still
at
school
?
''
asked
Miriam
of
Beatrice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
not
had
your
notice
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expect
it
at
Easter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
an
awful
shame
,
to
turn
you
off
merely
because
you
did
n't
pass
*NL*
the
exam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Beatrice
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agatha
says
you
're
as
good
as
any
teacher
anywhere
.
It
seems
to
me
*NL*
ridiculous
.
I
wonder
why
you
did
n't
pass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Short
of
brains
,
eh
,
`
Postle
?
''
said
Beatrice
briefly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
brains
to
bite
with
,
''
replied
Paul
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nuisance
!
''
she
cried
;
and
,
springing
from
her
seat
,
she
rushed
and
*NL*
boxed
his
ears
.
She
had
beautiful
small
hands
.
He
held
her
wrists
while
*NL*
she
wrestled
with
him
.
At
last
she
broke
free
,
and
seized
two
handfuls
*NL*
of
his
thick
,
dark
brown
hair
,
which
she
shook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beat
!
''
he
said
,
as
he
pulled
his
hair
straight
with
his
fingers
.
``
I
*NL*
hate
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
with
glee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
!
''
she
said
.
``
I
want
to
sit
next
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
as
lief
be
neighbours
with
a
vixen
,
''
he
said
,
nevertheless
making
*NL*
place
for
her
between
him
and
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
it
ruffle
his
pretty
hair
,
then
!
''
she
cried
;
and
,
with
her
*NL*
hair-comb
,
she
combed
him
straight
.
``
And
his
nice
little
moustache
!
''
*NL*
she
exclaimed
.
She
tilted
his
head
back
and
combed
his
young
moustache
.
*NL*
``
It
's
a
wicked
moustache
,
`
Postle
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
a
red
for
danger
.
*NL*
Have
you
got
any
of
those
cigarettes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pulled
his
cigarette-case
from
his
pocket
.
Beatrice
looked
inside
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
fancy
me
having
Connie
's
last
cig.
,
''
said
Beatrice
,
putting
the
*NL*
thing
between
her
teeth
.
He
held
a
lit
match
to
her
,
and
she
puffed
*NL*
daintily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
so
much
,
darling
,
''
she
said
mockingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
gave
her
a
wicked
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
he
does
it
nicely
,
Miriam
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
!
''
said
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
cigarette
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Light
,
old
boy
?
''
said
Beatrice
,
tilting
her
cigarette
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
forward
to
her
to
light
his
cigarette
at
hers
.
She
was
winking
*NL*
at
him
as
he
did
so
.
Miriam
saw
his
eyes
trembling
with
mischief
,
and
*NL*
his
full
,
almost
sensual
,
mouth
quivering
.
He
was
not
himself
,
and
she
*NL*
could
not
bear
it
.
As
he
was
now
,
she
had
no
connection
with
him
;
she
*NL*
might
as
well
not
have
existed
.
She
saw
the
cigarette
dancing
on
his
*NL*
full
red
lips
.
She
hated
his
thick
hair
for
being
tumbled
loose
on
his
*NL*
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sweet
boy
!
''
said
Beatrice
,
tipping
up
his
chin
and
giving
him
a
little
*NL*
kiss
on
the
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
kiss
thee
back
,
Beat
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
wunna
!
''
she
giggled
,
jumping
up
and
going
away
.
``
Is
n't
he
*NL*
shameless
,
Miriam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
,
''
said
Miriam
.
``
By
the
way
,
are
n't
you
forgetting
the
bread
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
!
''
he
cried
,
flinging
open
the
oven
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
puffed
the
bluish
smoke
and
a
smell
of
burned
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
golly
!
''
cried
Beatrice
,
coming
to
his
side
.
He
crouched
before
the
*NL*
oven
,
she
peered
over
his
shoulder
.
``
This
is
what
comes
of
the
oblivion
*NL*
of
love
,
my
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
ruefully
removing
the
loaves
.
One
was
burnt
black
on
the
hot
*NL*
side
;
another
was
hard
as
a
brick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
mater
!
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
grate
it
,
''
said
Beatrice
.
``
Fetch
me
the
nutmeg-grater
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
arranged
the
bread
in
the
oven
.
He
brought
the
grater
,
and
she
*NL*
grated
the
bread
on
to
a
newspaper
on
the
table
.
He
set
the
doors
open
*NL*
to
blow
away
the
smell
of
burned
bread
.
Beatrice
grated
away
,
puffing
*NL*
her
cigarette
,
knocking
the
charcoal
off
the
poor
loaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
,
Miriam
!
you
're
in
for
it
this
time
,
''
said
Beatrice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
!
''
exclaimed
Miriam
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
be
gone
when
his
mother
comes
in
.
I
know
why
King
Alfred
*NL*
burned
the
cakes
.
Now
I
see
it
!
`
Postle
would
fix
up
a
tale
about
his
*NL*
work
making
him
forget
,
if
he
thought
it
would
wash
.
If
that
old
woman
*NL*
had
come
in
a
bit
sooner
,
she
'd
have
boxed
the
brazen
thing
's
ears
who
*NL*
made
the
oblivion
,
instead
of
poor
Alfred
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
giggled
as
she
scraped
the
loaf
.
Even
Miriam
laughed
in
spite
of
*NL*
herself
.
Paul
mended
the
fire
ruefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
gate
was
heard
to
bang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
!
''
cried
Beatrice
,
giving
Paul
the
scraped
loaf
.
``
Wrap
it
up
in
a
*NL*
damp
towel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
disappeared
into
the
scullery
.
Beatrice
hastily
blew
her
scrapings
*NL*
into
the
fire
,
and
sat
down
innocently
.
Annie
came
bursting
in
.
She
was
*NL*
an
abrupt
,
quite
smart
young
woman
.
She
blinked
in
the
strong
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smell
of
burning
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
cigarettes
,
''
replied
Beatrice
demurely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
Paul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leonard
had
followed
Annie
.
He
had
a
long
comic
face
and
blue
eyes
,
very
*NL*
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
he
's
left
you
to
settle
it
between
you
,
''
he
said
.
He
nodded
*NL*
sympathetically
to
Miriam
,
and
became
gently
sarcastic
to
Beatrice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Beatrice
,
``
he
's
gone
off
with
number
nine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
just
met
number
five
inquiring
for
him
,
''
said
Leonard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
we
're
going
to
share
him
up
like
Solomon
's
baby
,
''
said
Beatrice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
ay
,
''
said
Leonard
.
``
And
which
bit
should
you
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
said
Beatrice
.
``
I
'll
let
all
the
others
pick
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
you
'd
have
the
leavings
,
like
?
''
said
Leonard
,
twisting
up
a
comic
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
was
looking
in
the
oven
.
Miriam
sat
ignored
.
Paul
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
bread
's
a
fine
sight
,
our
Paul
,
''
said
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
should
stop
an
'
look
after
it
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
YOU
should
do
what
you
're
reckoning
to
do
,
''
replied
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
should
,
should
n't
he
!
''
cried
Beatrice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'd
think
he
'd
got
plenty
on
hand
,
''
said
Leonard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
a
nasty
walk
,
did
n't
you
,
Miriam
?
''
said
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
but
I
'd
been
in
all
week
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
wanted
a
bit
of
a
change
,
like
,
''
insinuated
Leonard
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
ca
n't
be
stuck
in
the
house
for
ever
,
''
Annie
agreed
.
She
was
*NL*
quite
amiable
.
Beatrice
pulled
on
her
coat
,
and
went
out
with
Leonard
*NL*
and
Annie
.
She
would
meet
her
own
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
forget
that
bread
,
our
Paul
,
''
cried
Annie
.
``
Good-night
,
Miriam
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
it
will
rain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
all
gone
,
Paul
fetched
the
swathed
loaf
,
unwrapped
it
,
and
*NL*
surveyed
it
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
mess
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
answered
Miriam
impatiently
,
``
what
is
it
,
after
all
--
twopence
,
*NL*
ha
`
penny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
--
it
's
the
mater
's
precious
baking
,
and
she
'll
take
it
to
*NL*
heart
.
However
,
it
's
no
good
bothering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
loaf
back
into
the
scullery
.
There
was
a
little
distance
*NL*
between
him
and
Miriam
.
He
stood
balanced
opposite
her
for
some
moments
*NL*
considering
,
thinking
of
his
behaviour
with
Beatrice
.
He
felt
guilty
*NL*
inside
himself
,
and
yet
glad
.
For
some
inscrutable
reason
it
served
*NL*
Miriam
right
.
He
was
not
going
to
repent
.
She
wondered
what
he
was
*NL*
thinking
of
as
he
stood
suspended
.
His
thick
hair
was
tumbled
over
his
*NL*
forehead
.
Why
might
she
not
push
it
back
for
him
,
and
remove
the
marks
*NL*
of
Beatrice
's
comb
?
Why
might
she
not
press
his
body
with
her
two
hands
.
*NL*
It
looked
so
firm
,
and
every
whit
living
.
And
he
would
let
other
girls
,
*NL*
why
not
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
started
into
life
.
It
made
her
quiver
almost
with
terror
as
*NL*
he
quickly
pushed
the
hair
off
his
forehead
and
came
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-past
eight
!
''
he
said
.
``
We
'd
better
buck
up
.
Where
's
your
French
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
shyly
and
rather
bitterly
produced
her
exercise-book
.
Every
week
*NL*
she
wrote
for
him
a
sort
of
diary
of
her
inner
life
,
in
her
own
French
.
*NL*
He
had
found
this
was
the
only
way
to
get
her
to
do
compositions
.
And
*NL*
her
diary
was
mostly
a
love-letter
.
He
would
read
it
now
;
she
felt
as
*NL*
if
her
soul
's
history
were
going
to
be
desecrated
by
him
in
his
present
*NL*
mood
.
He
sat
beside
her
.
She
watched
his
hand
,
firm
and
warm
,
rigorously
*NL*
scoring
her
work
.
He
was
reading
only
the
French
,
ignoring
her
soul
that
*NL*
was
there
.
But
gradually
his
hand
forgot
its
work
.
He
read
in
silence
,
*NL*
motionless
.
She
quivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
_
Ce
matin
les
oiseaux
m
`
ont
eveille

'
''
he
read
.
''
`
Il
faisait
encore
un
*NL*
crepuscule
.
Mais
la
petite
fenetre
de
ma
chambre
etait
bleme
,
et
puis
,
*NL*
jaune
,
et
tous
les
oiseaux
du
bois
eclaterent
dans
un
chanson
vif
et
*NL*
resonnant

Toute
l'aube
tressaillit

J'avais

Est-ce
*NL*
que
vous
voyez
aussi
l'aube
?
Les

presque
tous
les
*NL*
matins
,
et
toujours
il
y
a
quelque
chose
de
terreur
dans
le
cri
des
*NL*
grives
.
Il
est
si
clair
_
--

''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
sat
tremulous
,
half
ashamed
.
He
remained
quite
still
,
trying
to
*NL*
understand
.
He
only
knew
she
loved
him
.
He
was
afraid
of
her
love
for
*NL*
him
.
It
was
too
good
for
him
,
and
he
was
inadequate
.
His
own
love
was
*NL*
at
fault
,
not
hers
.
Ashamed
,
he
corrected
her
work
,
humbly
writing
above
*NL*
her
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
''
he
said
quietly
,
``
the
past
participle
conjugated
with
_
avoir
_
*NL*
agrees
with
the
direct
object
when
it
precedes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bent
forward
,
trying
to
see
and
to
understand
.
Her
free
,
fine
curls
*NL*
tickled
his
face
.
He
started
as
if
they
had
been
red
hot
,
shuddering
.
He
*NL*
saw
her
peering
forward
at
the
page
,
her
red
lips
parted
piteously
,
the
*NL*
black
hair
springing
in
fine
strands
across
her
tawny
,
ruddy
cheek
.
She
*NL*
was
coloured
like
a
pomegranate
for
richness
.
His
breath
came
short
as
*NL*
he
watched
her
.
Suddenly
she
looked
up
at
him
.
Her
dark
eyes
were
naked
*NL*
with
their
love
,
afraid
,
and
yearning
.
His
eyes
,
too
,
were
dark
,
and
*NL*
they
hurt
her
.
They
seemed
to
master
her
.
She
lost
all
her
self-control
,
*NL*
was
exposed
in
fear
.
And
he
knew
,
before
he
could
kiss
her
,
he
must
*NL*
drive
something
out
of
himself
.
And
a
touch
of
hate
for
her
crept
back
*NL*
again
into
his
heart
.
He
returned
to
her
exercise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
flung
down
the
pencil
,
and
was
at
the
oven
in
a
leap
,
*NL*
turning
the
bread
.
For
Miriam
he
was
too
quick
.
She
started
violently
,
*NL*
and
it
hurt
her
with
real
pain
.
Even
the
way
he
crouched
before
the
oven
*NL*
hurt
her
.
There
seemed
to
be
something
cruel
in
it
,
something
cruel
in
*NL*
the
swift
way
he
pitched
the
bread
out
of
the
tins
,
caught
it
up
again
.
*NL*
If
only
he
had
been
gentle
in
his
movements
she
would
have
felt
so
rich
*NL*
and
warm
.
As
it
was
,
she
was
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
and
finished
the
exercise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
done
well
this
week
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
he
was
flattered
by
her
diary
.
It
did
not
repay
her
entirely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
really
do
blossom
out
sometimes
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
ought
to
write
*NL*
poetry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lifted
her
head
with
joy
,
then
she
shook
it
mistrustfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
trust
myself
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
try
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
read
,
or
is
it
too
late
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
late
--
but
we
can
read
just
a
little
,
''
she
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
really
getting
now
the
food
for
her
life
during
the
next
week
.
*NL*
He
made
her
copy
Baudelaire
's
``
Le
Balcon
''
.
Then
he
read
it
for
her
.
His
*NL*
voice
was
soft
and
caressing
,
but
growing
almost
brutal
.
He
had
a
way
of
*NL*
lifting
his
lips
and
showing
his
teeth
,
passionately
and
bitterly
,
when
*NL*
he
was
much
moved
.
This
he
did
now
.
It
made
Miriam
feel
as
if
he
were
*NL*
trampling
on
her
.
She
dared
not
look
at
him
,
but
sat
with
her
head
*NL*
bowed
.
She
could
not
understand
why
he
got
into
such
a
tumult
and
fury
.
*NL*
It
made
her
wretched
.
She
did
not
like
Baudelaire
,
on
the
whole
--
nor
*NL*
Verlaine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behold
her
singing
in
the
field
*NL*
Yon
solitary
highland
lass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
nourished
her
heart
.
So
did
``
Fair
Ines
''
.
And
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
beauteous
evening
,
calm
and
pure
,
*NL*
And
breathing
holy
quiet
like
a
nun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
like
herself
.
And
there
was
he
,
saying
in
his
throat
*NL*
bitterly
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Tu
te
rappelleras
la
beaute
des
caresses
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poem
was
finished
;
he
took
the
bread
out
of
the
oven
,
arranging
the
*NL*
burnt
loaves
at
the
bottom
of
the
panchion
,
the
good
ones
at
the
top
.
*NL*
The
desiccated
loaf
remained
swathed
up
in
the
scullery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mater
need
n't
know
till
morning
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
wo
n't
upset
her
so
much
*NL*
then
as
at
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
looked
in
the
bookcase
,
saw
what
postcards
and
letters
he
had
*NL*
received
,
saw
what
books
were
there
.
She
took
one
that
had
interested
*NL*
him
.
Then
he
turned
down
the
gas
and
they
set
off
.
He
did
not
trouble
to
*NL*
lock
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
home
again
until
a
quarter
to
eleven
.
His
mother
was
seated
*NL*
in
the
rocking-chair
.
Annie
,
with
a
rope
of
hair
hanging
down
her
back
,
*NL*
remained
sitting
on
a
low
stool
before
the
fire
,
her
elbows
on
her
*NL*
knees
,
gloomily
.
On
the
table
stood
the
offending
loaf
unswathed
.
Paul
*NL*
entered
rather
breathless
.
No
one
spoke
.
His
mother
was
reading
the
*NL*
little
local
newspaper
.
He
took
off
his
coat
,
and
went
to
sit
down
on
*NL*
the
sofa
.
His
mother
moved
curtly
aside
to
let
him
pass
.
No
one
spoke
.
*NL*
He
was
very
uncomfortable
.
For
some
minutes
he
sat
pretending
to
read
a
*NL*
piece
of
paper
he
found
on
the
table
.
Then
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgot
that
bread
,
mother
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
from
either
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
's
only
twopence
ha
`
penny
.
I
can
pay
you
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Being
angry
,
he
put
three
pennies
on
the
table
and
slid
them
towards
his
*NL*
mother
.
She
turned
away
her
head
.
Her
mouth
was
shut
tightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Annie
,
``
you
do
n't
know
how
badly
my
mother
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
sat
staring
glumly
into
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
she
badly
?
''
asked
Paul
,
in
his
overbearing
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
Annie
.
``
She
could
scarcely
get
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
closely
at
his
mother
.
She
looked
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
WHY
could
you
scarcely
get
home
?
''
he
asked
her
,
still
sharply
.
She
*NL*
would
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
her
as
white
as
a
sheet
sitting
here
,
''
said
Annie
,
with
a
*NL*
suggestion
of
tears
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
WHY
?
''
insisted
Paul
.
His
brows
were
knitting
,
his
eyes
dilating
*NL*
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
enough
to
upset
anybody
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
``
hugging
those
*NL*
parcels
--
meat
,
and
green-groceries
,
and
a
pair
of
curtains
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
DID
you
hug
them
;
you
need
n't
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
who
would
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
Annie
fetch
the
meat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
WOULD
fetch
the
meat
,
but
how
was
I
to
know
.
You
were
off
*NL*
with
Miriam
,
instead
of
being
in
when
my
mother
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
was
the
matter
with
you
?
''
asked
Paul
of
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
's
my
heart
,
''
she
replied
.
Certainly
she
looked
bluish
*NL*
round
the
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
felt
it
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
often
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
have
n't
you
told
me
?
--
and
why
have
n't
you
seen
a
doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
shifted
in
her
chair
,
angry
with
him
for
his
hectoring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
never
notice
anything
,
''
said
Annie
.
``
You
're
too
eager
to
be
off
*NL*
with
Miriam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
am
I
--
and
any
worse
than
you
with
Leonard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
in
at
a
quarter
to
ten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
in
the
room
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
thought
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
bitterly
,
``
that
she
would
n't
*NL*
have
occupied
you
so
entirely
as
to
burn
a
whole
ovenful
of
bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beatrice
was
here
as
well
as
she
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
.
But
we
know
why
the
bread
is
spoilt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
he
flashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
were
engrossed
with
Miriam
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Morel
hotly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
--
then
it
was
NOT
!
''
he
replied
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
distressed
and
wretched
.
Seizing
a
paper
,
he
began
to
read
.
*NL*
Annie
,
her
blouse
unfastened
,
her
long
ropes
of
hair
twisted
into
a
*NL*
plait
,
went
up
to
bed
,
bidding
him
a
very
curt
good-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
sat
pretending
to
read
.
He
knew
his
mother
wanted
to
upbraid
him
.
*NL*
He
also
wanted
to
know
what
had
made
her
ill
,
for
he
was
troubled
.
So
,
*NL*
instead
of
running
away
to
bed
,
as
he
would
have
liked
to
do
,
he
sat
and
*NL*
waited
.
There
was
a
tense
silence
.
The
clock
ticked
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
go
to
bed
before
your
father
comes
in
,
''
said
the
mother
*NL*
harshly
.
``
And
if
you
're
going
to
have
anything
to
eat
,
you
'd
better
get
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
his
mother
's
custom
to
bring
him
some
trifle
for
supper
on
Friday
*NL*
night
,
the
night
of
luxury
for
the
colliers
.
He
was
too
angry
to
go
and
*NL*
find
it
in
the
pantry
this
night
.
This
insulted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
WANTED
you
to
go
to
Selby
on
Friday
night
,
I
can
imagine
the
*NL*
scene
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
But
you
're
never
too
tired
to
go
if
SHE
will
*NL*
come
for
you
.
Nay
,
you
neither
want
to
eat
nor
drink
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
let
her
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
?
And
why
does
she
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
because
I
ask
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
n't
come
without
you
want
her
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
if
I
DO
want
her
--
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
nothing
,
if
it
was
sensible
or
reasonable
.
But
to
go
trapseing
up
*NL*
there
miles
and
miles
in
the
mud
,
coming
home
at
midnight
,
and
got
to
go
*NL*
to
Nottingham
in
the
morning
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
n't
,
you
'd
be
just
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
should
,
because
there
's
no
sense
in
it
.
Is
she
so
fascinating
*NL*
that
you
must
follow
her
all
that
way
?
''
Mrs.
Morel
was
bitterly
*NL*
sarcastic
.
She
sat
still
,
with
averted
face
,
stroking
with
a
rhythmic
,
*NL*
jerked
movement
,
the
black
sateen
of
her
apron
.
It
was
a
movement
that
*NL*
hurt
Paul
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
like
her
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
LIKE
her
!
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
in
the
same
biting
tones
.
``
It
seems
to
me
*NL*
you
like
nothing

nobody
else

There

neither

nor
*NL*
anyone

*NL*
*NL*
``

tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

often

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
nobody

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

Mrs.
Morel
was
so
intense
that
Paul
began
to
pant

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

painting

books

YOU

Herbert

No

was
the
sad

defiantly

He
knitted
his
brows
with
pain

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
He
only
meant
that
the
interests
of
HER
age
were
not
the
interests
of
*NL*
his
.
But
he
realised
the
moment
he
had
spoken
that
he
had
said
the
wrong
*NL*
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I

the
rest
*NL*
is
for
Miriam

*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
bear
it
.
Instinctively
he
realised
that
he
was
life
to
her
.
*NL*
And
,
after
all
,
she
was
the
chief
thing
to
him
,
the
only
supreme
thing

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
moved
to
pity
by
his
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
a
great
deal

she
said

half
putting
aside
her
*NL*
despair

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
He
had
taken
off
his
collar
and
tie
,
and
rose
,
bare-throated
,
to
go
*NL*
to
bed
.
As
he
stooped
to
kiss
his
mother
,
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
*NL*
neck
,
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder

and
cried
,
in
a
whimpering
voice

so
*NL*
unlike
her
own
that
he
writhed
in
agony
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't

*NL*
no

not

*NL*
And
immediately
he
hated

bitterly

Paul

I

never
had

not

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stroked
his
mother
's
hair
,
and
his
mouth
was
on
her
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
exults
so
in
taking
you
from
me
--
she
's
not
like
ordinary
*NL*
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
love
her
,
mother
,
''
he
murmured
,
bowing
his
head
and
*NL*
hiding
his
eyes
on
her
shoulder
in
misery
.
His
mother
kissed
him
a
long
,
*NL*
fervent
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
boy
!
''
she
said
,
in
a
voice
trembling
with
passionate
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
knowing
,
he
gently
stroked
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
his
mother
,
``
now
go
to
bed
.
You
'll
be
so
tired
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
''
As
she
was
speaking
she
heard
her
husband
coming
.
``
There
's
*NL*
your
father
--
now
go
.
''
Suddenly
she
looked
at
him
almost
as
if
in
fear
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
'm
selfish
.
If
you
want
her
,
take
her
,
my
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
looked
so
strange
,
Paul
kissed
her
,
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
--
mother
!
''
he
said
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
came
in
,
walking
unevenly
.
His
hat
was
over
one
corner
of
his
eye
.
*NL*
He
balanced
in
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
your
mischief
again
?
''
he
said
venomously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
's
emotion
turned
into
sudden
hate
of
the
drunkard
who
had
*NL*
come
in
thus
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
it
is
sober
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
--
h
'm
!
h
'm
--
h
'm
!
''
he
sneered
.
He
went
into
the
passage
,
hung
up
his
*NL*
hat
and
coat
.
Then
they
heard
him
go
down
three
steps
to
the
pantry
.
He
*NL*
returned
with
a
piece
of
pork-pie
in
his
fist
.
It
was
what
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
had
bought
for
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
was
that
bought
for
you
.
If
you
can
give
me
no
more
than
*NL*
twenty-five
shillings
,
I
'm
sure
I
'm
not
going
to
buy
you
pork-pie
to
*NL*
stuff
,
after
you
've
swilled
a
bellyful
of
beer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wha-at
--
wha-at
!
''
snarled
Morel
,
toppling
in
his
balance
.
``
Wha-at
--
not
*NL*
for
me
?
''
He
looked
at
the
piece
of
meat
and
crust
,
and
suddenly
,
in
a
*NL*
vicious
spurt
of
temper
,
flung
it
into
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
started
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waste
your
own
stuff
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
what
!
''
suddenly
shouted
Morel
,
jumping
up
and
clenching
his
fist
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
show
yer
,
yer
young
jockey
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
''
said
Paul
viciously
,
putting
his
head
on
one
side
.
``
Show
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
at
that
moment
dearly
have
loved
to
have
a
smack
at
something
.
*NL*
Morel
was
half
crouching
,
fists
up
,
ready
to
spring
.
The
young
man
*NL*
stood
,
smiling
with
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ussha
!
''
hissed
the
father
,
swiping
round
with
a
great
stroke
just
past
*NL*
his
son
's
face
.
He
dared
not
,
even
though
so
close
,
really
touch
the
*NL*
young
man
,
but
swerved
an
inch
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
!
''
said
Paul
,
his
eyes
upon
the
side
of
his
father
's
mouth
,
where
*NL*
in
another
instant
his
fist
would
have
hit
.
He
ached
for
that
stroke
.
*NL*
But
he
heard
a
faint
moan
from
behind
.
His
mother
was
deadly
pale
and
*NL*
dark
at
the
mouth
.
Morel
was
dancing
up
to
deliver
another
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
''
said
Paul
,
so
that
the
word
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
started
,
and
stood
at
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
''
moaned
the
boy
.
``
Mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
struggle
with
herself
.
Her
open
eyes
watched
him
,
although
*NL*
she
could
not
move
.
Gradually
she
was
coming
to
herself
.
He
laid
her
*NL*
down
on
the
sofa
,
and
ran
upstairs
for
a
little
whisky
,
which
at
last
*NL*
she
could
sip
.
The
tears
were
hopping
down
his
face
.
As
he
kneeled
in
*NL*
front
of
her
he
did
not
cry
,
but
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
quickly
.
*NL*
Morel
,
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
,
sat
with
his
elbows
on
his
*NL*
knees
glaring
across
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a-matter
with
`
er
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faint
!
''
replied
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elderly
man
began
to
unlace
his
boots
.
He
stumbled
off
to
bed
.
His
*NL*
last
fight
was
fought
in
that
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
kneeled
there
,
stroking
his
mother
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
poorly
,
mother
--
do
n't
be
poorly
!
''
he
said
time
after
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
my
boy
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
rose
,
fetched
in
a
large
piece
of
coal
,
and
raked
the
fire
.
*NL*
Then
he
cleared
the
room
,
put
everything
straight
,
laid
the
things
for
*NL*
breakfast
,
and
brought
his
mother
's
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
go
to
bed
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'll
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sleep
with
Annie
,
mother
,
not
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
'll
sleep
in
my
own
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
sleep
with
him
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
sleep
in
my
own
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
,
and
he
turned
out
the
gas
,
then
followed
her
closely
upstairs
,
*NL*
carrying
her
candle
.
On
the
landing
he
kissed
her
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
his
face
upon
the
pillow
in
a
fury
of
misery
.
And
yet
,
*NL*
somewhere
in
his
soul
,
he
was
at
peace
because
he
still
loved
his
mother
*NL*
best
.
It
was
the
bitter
peace
of
resignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
efforts
of
his
father
to
conciliate
him
next
day
were
a
great
*NL*
humiliation
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
tried
to
forget
the
scene
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
DEFEAT
OF
MIRIAM
*NL*
*NL*
PAUL
was
dissatisfied
with
himself
and
with
everything
.
The
deepest
*NL*
of
his
love
belonged
to
his
mother
.
When
he
felt
he
had
hurt
her
,
or
*NL*
wounded
his
love
for
her
,
he
could
not
bear
it
.
Now
it
was
spring
,
and
*NL*
there
was
battle
between
him
and
Miriam
.
This
year
he
had
a
good
deal
*NL*
against
her
.
She
was
vaguely
aware
of
it
.
The
old
feeling
that
she
was
*NL*
to
be
a
sacrifice
to
this
love
,
which
she
had
had
when
she
prayed
,
was
*NL*
mingled
in
all
her
emotions
.
She
did
not
at
the
bottom
believe
she
*NL*
ever
would
have
him
.
She
did
not
believe
in
herself
primarily
:
doubted
*NL*
whether
she
could
ever
be
what
he
would
demand
of
her
.
Certainly
she
*NL*
never
saw
herself
living
happily
through
a
lifetime
with
him
.
She
saw
*NL*
tragedy
,
sorrow
,
and
sacrifice
ahead
.
And
in
sacrifice
she
was
proud
,
*NL*
in
renunciation
she
was
strong
,
for
she
did
not
trust
herself
to
support
*NL*
everyday
life
.
She
was
prepared
for
the
big
things
and
the
deep
things
,
*NL*
like
tragedy
.
It
was
the
sufficiency
of
the
small
day-life
she
could
not
*NL*
trust
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Easter
holidays
began
happily
.
Paul
was
his
own
frank
self
.
Yet
she
*NL*
felt
it
would
go
wrong
.
On
the
Sunday
afternoon
she
stood
at
her
bedroom
*NL*
window
,
looking
across
at
the
oak-trees
of
the
wood
,
in
whose
branches
a
*NL*
twilight
was
tangled
,
below
the
bright
sky
of
the
afternoon
.
Grey-green
*NL*
rosettes
of
honeysuckle
leaves
hung
before
the
window
,
some
already
,
she
*NL*
fancied
,
showing
bud
.
It
was
spring
,
which
she
loved
and
dreaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hearing
the
clack
of
the
gate
she
stood
in
suspense
.
It
was
a
bright
*NL*
grey
day
.
Paul
came
into
the
yard
with
his
bicycle
,
which
glittered
*NL*
as
he
walked
.
Usually
he
rang
his
bell
and
laughed
towards
the
house
.
*NL*
To-day
he
walked
with
shut
lips
and
cold
,
cruel
bearing
,
that
had
*NL*
something
of
a
slouch
and
a
sneer
in
it
.
She
knew
him
well
by
now
,
and
*NL*
could
tell
from
that
keen-looking
,
aloof
young
body
of
his
what
was
*NL*
happening
inside
him
.
There
was
a
cold
correctness
in
the
way
he
put
his
*NL*
bicycle
in
its
place
,
that
made
her
heart
sink
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
downstairs
nervously
.
She
was
wearing
a
new
net
blouse
that
she
*NL*
thought
became
her
.
It
had
a
high
collar
with
a
tiny
ruff
,
reminding
her
*NL*
of
Mary
,
Queen
of
Scots
,
and
making
her
,
she
thought
,
look
wonderfully
*NL*
a
woman
,
and
dignified
.
At
twenty
she
was
full-breasted
and
luxuriously
*NL*
formed
.
Her
face
was
still
like
a
soft
rich
mask
,
unchangeable
.
But
*NL*
her
eyes
,
once
lifted
,
were
wonderful
.
She
was
afraid
of
him
.
He
would
*NL*
notice
her
new
blouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
,
being
in
a
hard
,
ironical
mood
,
was
entertaining
the
family
to
*NL*
a
description
of
a
service
given
in
the
Primitive
Methodist
Chapel
,
*NL*
conducted
by
one
of
the
well-known
preachers
of
the
sect
.
He
sat
at
*NL*
the
head
of
the
table
,
his
mobile
face
,
with
the
eyes
that
could
be
so
*NL*
beautiful
,
shining
with
tenderness
or
dancing
with
laughter
,
now
taking
*NL*
on
one
expression
and
then
another
,
in
imitation
of
various
people
he
*NL*
was
mocking
.
His
mockery
always
hurt
her
;
it
was
too
near
the
reality
.
*NL*
He
was
too
clever
and
cruel
.
She
felt
that
when
his
eyes
were
like
this
,
*NL*
hard
with
mocking
hate
,
he
would
spare
neither
himself
nor
anybody
else
.
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Leivers
was
wiping
her
eyes
with
laughter
,
and
Mr.
Leivers
,
*NL*
just
awake
from
his
Sunday
nap
,
was
rubbing
his
head
in
amusement
.
*NL*
The
three
brothers
sat
with
ruffled
,
sleepy
appearance
in
their
*NL*
shirt-sleeves
,
giving
a
guffaw
from
time
to
time
.
The
whole
family
loved
*NL*
a
``
take-off
''
more
than
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
no
notice
of
Miriam
.
Later
,
she
saw
him
remark
her
new
blouse
,
*NL*
saw
that
the
artist
approved
,
but
it
won
from
him
not
a
spark
of
warmth
.
*NL*
She
was
nervous
,
could
hardly
reach
the
teacups
from
the
shelves
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
men
went
out
to
milk
,
she
ventured
to
address
him
personally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
late
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
?
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
rough
riding
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
notice
it
.
''
She
continued
quickly
to
lay
the
table
.
When
she
*NL*
had
finished
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tea
wo
n't
be
for
a
few
minutes
.
Will
you
come
and
look
at
the
*NL*
daffodils
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
without
answering
.
They
went
out
into
the
back
garden
under
*NL*
the
budding
damson-trees
.
The
hills
and
the
sky
were
clean
and
cold
.
*NL*
Everything
looked
washed
,
rather
hard
.
Miriam
glanced
at
Paul
.
He
was
*NL*
pale
and
impassive
.
It
seemed
cruel
to
her
that
his
eyes
and
brows
,
*NL*
which
she
loved
,
could
look
so
hurting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
the
wind
made
you
tired
?
''
she
asked
.
She
detected
an
underneath
*NL*
feeling
of
weariness
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
think
not
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
rough
on
the
road
--
the
wood
moans
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
see
by
the
clouds
it
's
a
south-west
wind
;
that
helps
me
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
do
n't
cycle
,
so
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
need
to
cycle
to
know
that
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
his
sarcasms
were
unnecessary
.
They
went
forward
in
silence
.
*NL*
Round
the
wild
,
tussocky
lawn
at
the
back
of
the
house
was
a
thorn
*NL*
hedge
,
under
which
daffodils
were
craning
forward
from
among
their
*NL*
sheaves
of
grey-green
blades
.
The
cheeks
of
the
flowers
were
greenish
*NL*
with
cold
.
But
still
some
had
burst
,
and
their
gold
ruffled
and
glowed
.
*NL*
Miriam
went
on
her
knees
before
one
cluster
,
took
a
wild-looking
*NL*
daffodil
between
her
hands
,
turned
up
its
face
of
gold
to
her
,
and
bowed
*NL*
down
,
caressing
it
with
her
mouth
and
cheeks
and
brow
.
He
stood
aside
,
*NL*
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
watching
her
.
One
after
another
she
*NL*
turned
up
to
him
the
faces
of
the
yellow
,
bursten
flowers
appealingly
,
*NL*
fondling
them
lavishly
all
the
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
they
magnificent
?
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Magnificent
!
It
's
a
bit
thick
--
they
're
pretty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bowed
again
to
her
flowers
at
his
censure
of
her
praise
.
He
watched
*NL*
her
crouching
,
sipping
the
flowers
with
fervid
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
must
you
always
be
fondling
things
?
''
he
said
irritably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
love
to
touch
them
,
''
she
replied
,
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
never
like
things
without
clutching
them
as
if
you
wanted
to
*NL*
pull
the
heart
out
of
them
?
Why
do
n't
you
have
a
bit
more
restraint
,
or
*NL*
reserve
,
or
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
at
him
full
of
pain
,
then
continued
slowly
to
stroke
her
*NL*
lips
against
a
ruffled
flower
.
Their
scent
,
as
she
smelled
it
,
was
so
*NL*
much
kinder
than
he
;
it
almost
made
her
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wheedle
the
soul
out
of
things
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
would
never
*NL*
wheedle
--
at
any
rate
,
I
'd
go
straight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
.
These
things
came
from
him
*NL*
mechanically
.
She
looked
at
him
.
His
body
seemed
one
weapon
,
firm
and
*NL*
hard
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
always
begging
things
to
love
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
as
if
you
were
a
*NL*
beggar
for
love
.
Even
the
flowers
,
you
have
to
fawn
on
them
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rhythmically
,
Miriam
was
swaying
and
stroking
the
flower
with
her
mouth
,
*NL*
inhaling
the
scent
which
ever
after
made
her
shudder
as
it
came
to
her
*NL*
nostrils
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
want
to
love
--
your
eternal
and
abnormal
craving
is
to
be
*NL*
loved
.
You
are
n't
positive
,
you
're
negative
.
You
absorb
,
absorb
,
as
*NL*
if
you
must
fill
yourself
up
with
love
,
because
you
've
got
a
shortage
*NL*
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
stunned
by
his
cruelty
,
and
did
not
hear
.
He
had
not
the
*NL*
faintest
notion
of
what
he
was
saying
.
It
was
as
if
his
fretted
,
*NL*
tortured
soul
,
run
hot
by
thwarted
passion
,
jetted
off
these
sayings
*NL*
like
sparks
from
electricity
.
She
did
not
grasp
anything
he
said
.
She
*NL*
only
sat
crouched
beneath
his
cruelty
and
his
hatred
of
her
.
She
never
*NL*
realised
in
a
flash
.
Over
everything
she
brooded
and
brooded
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
he
stayed
with
Edgar
and
the
brothers
,
taking
no
notice
of
*NL*
Miriam
.
She
,
extremely
unhappy
on
this
looked-for
holiday
,
waited
for
*NL*
him
.
And
at
last
he
yielded
and
came
to
her
.
She
was
determined
to
track
*NL*
this
mood
of
his
to
its
origin
.
She
counted
it
not
much
more
than
a
*NL*
mood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
through
the
wood
a
little
way
?
''
she
asked
him
,
knowing
he
*NL*
never
refused
a
direct
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
down
to
the
warren
.
On
the
middle
path
they
passed
a
trap
,
a
*NL*
narrow
horseshoe
hedge
of
small
fir-boughs
,
baited
with
the
guts
of
a
*NL*
rabbit
.
Paul
glanced
at
it
frowning
.
She
caught
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
dreadful
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
!
Is
it
worse
than
a
weasel
with
its
teeth
in
a
rabbit
's
*NL*
throat
?
One
weasel
or
many
rabbits
?
One
or
the
other
must
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
taking
the
bitterness
of
life
badly
.
She
was
rather
sorry
for
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
go
back
to
the
house
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
walk
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
past
the
lilac-tree
,
whose
bronze
leaf-buds
were
coming
*NL*
unfastened
.
Just
a
fragment
remained
of
the
haystack
,
a
monument
squared
*NL*
and
brown
,
like
a
pillar
of
stone
.
There
was
a
little
bed
of
hay
from
*NL*
the
last
cutting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
sit
here
a
minute
,
''
said
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
against
his
will
,
resting
his
back
against
the
hard
wall
of
*NL*
hay
.
They
faced
the
amphitheatre
of
round
hills
that
glowed
with
sunset
,
*NL*
tiny
white
farms
standing
out
,
the
meadows
golden
,
the
woods
dark
and
*NL*
yet
luminous
,
tree-tops
folded
over
tree-tops
,
distinct
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
The
evening
had
cleared
,
and
the
east
was
tender
with
a
magenta
flush
*NL*
under
which
the
land
lay
still
and
rich
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
beautiful
?
''
she
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
only
scowled
.
He
would
rather
have
had
it
ugly
just
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
big
bull-terrier
came
rushing
up
,
open-mouthed
,
pranced
*NL*
his
two
paws
on
the
youth
's
shoulders
,
licking
his
face
.
Paul
drew
back
,
*NL*
laughing
.
Bill
was
a
great
relief
to
him
.
He
pushed
the
dog
aside
,
but
*NL*
it
came
leaping
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
,
''
said
the
lad
,
``
or
I
'll
dot
thee
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
dog
was
not
to
be
pushed
away
.
So
Paul
had
a
little
battle
*NL*
with
the
creature
,
pitching
poor
Bill
away
from
him
,
who
,
however
,
*NL*
only
floundered
tumultuously
back
again
,
wild
with
joy
.
The
two
fought
*NL*
together
,
the
man
laughing
grudgingly
,
the
dog
grinning
all
over
.
Miriam
*NL*
watched
them
.
There
was
something
pathetic
about
the
man
.
He
wanted
so
*NL*
badly
to
love
,
to
be
tender
.
The
rough
way
he
bowled
the
dog
over
was
*NL*
really
loving
.
Bill
got
up
,
panting
with
happiness
,
his
brown
eyes
*NL*
rolling
in
his
white
face
,
and
lumbered
back
again
.
He
adored
Paul
.
The
*NL*
lad
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bill
,
I
've
had
enough
o
'
thee
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
dog
only
stood
with
two
heavy
paws
,
that
quivered
with
love
,
*NL*
upon
his
thigh
,
and
flickered
a
red
tongue
at
him
.
He
drew
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
--
``
no
--
I
've
had
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
a
minute
the
dog
trotted
off
happily
,
to
vary
the
fun
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
staring
miserably
across
at
the
hills
,
whose
still
beauty
*NL*
he
begrudged
.
He
wanted
to
go
and
cycle
with
Edgar
.
Yet
he
had
not
the
*NL*
courage
to
leave
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
sad
?
''
she
asked
humbly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sad
;
why
should
I
be
,
''
he
answered
.
``
I
'm
only
normal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
why
he
always
claimed
to
be
normal
when
he
was
*NL*
disagreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
the
matter
?
''
she
pleaded
,
coaxing
him
soothingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
!
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
picked
up
a
stick
and
began
to
stab
the
earth
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
far
better
not
talk
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
wish
to
know
--
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
resentfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
do
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
fair
to
me
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thrust
,
thrust
,
thrust
at
the
ground
with
the
pointed
stick
,
digging
*NL*
up
little
clods
of
earth
as
if
he
were
in
a
fever
of
irritation
.
She
*NL*
gently
and
firmly
laid
her
band
on
his
wrist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
!
''
she
said
.
``
Put
it
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
flung
the
stick
into
the
currant-bushes
,
and
leaned
back
.
Now
he
was
*NL*
bottled
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
she
pleaded
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
perfectly
still
,
only
his
eyes
alive
,
and
they
full
of
torment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
he
said
at
length
,
rather
wearily
--
``
you
know
--
we
'd
better
*NL*
break
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
what
she
dreaded
.
Swiftly
everything
seemed
to
darken
before
her
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
''
she
murmured
.
``
What
has
happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
has
happened
.
We
only
realise
where
we
are
.
It
's
no
good
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
waited
in
silence
,
sadly
,
patiently
.
It
was
no
good
being
impatient
*NL*
with
him
.
At
any
rate
,
he
would
tell
her
now
what
ailed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
agreed
on
friendship
,
''
he
went
on
in
a
dull
,
monotonous
voice
.
``
How
*NL*
often
HAVE
we
agreed
for
friendship
!
And
yet
--
it
neither
stops
there
,
*NL*
nor
gets
anywhere
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
again
.
She
brooded
.
What
did
he
mean
?
He
was
so
wearying
.
*NL*
There
was
something
he
would
not
yield
.
Yet
she
must
be
patient
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
only
give
friendship
--
it
's
all
I
'm
capable
of
--
it
's
a
flaw
in
my
*NL*
make-up
.
The
thing
overbalances
to
one
side
--
I
hate
a
toppling
balance
.
*NL*
Let
us
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
warmth
of
fury
in
his
last
phrases
.
He
meant
she
loved
him
*NL*
more
than
he
her
.
Perhaps
he
could
not
love
her
.
Perhaps
she
had
not
*NL*
in
herself
that
which
he
wanted
.
It
was
the
deepest
motive
of
her
*NL*
soul
,
this
self-mistrust
.
It
was
so
deep
she
dared
neither
realise
nor
*NL*
acknowledge
.
Perhaps
she
was
deficient
.
Like
an
infinitely
subtle
shame
,
*NL*
it
kept
her
always
back
.
If
it
were
so
,
she
would
do
without
him
.
She
*NL*
would
never
let
herself
want
him
.
She
would
merely
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
has
happened
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
--
it
's
all
in
myself
--
it
only
comes
out
just
now
.
We
're
always
*NL*
like
this
towards
Easter-time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
grovelled
so
helplessly
,
she
pitied
him
.
At
least
she
never
*NL*
floundered
in
such
a
pitiable
way
.
After
all
,
it
was
he
who
was
chiefly
*NL*
humiliated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
she
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
I
must
n't
come
often
--
that
's
all
.
Why
should
I
monopolise
you
when
*NL*
I
'm
not
--
You
see
,
I
'm
deficient
in
something
with
regard
to
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
telling
her
he
did
not
love
her
,
and
so
ought
to
leave
her
a
*NL*
chance
with
another
man
.
How
foolish
and
blind
and
shamefully
clumsy
he
*NL*
was
!
What
were
other
men
to
her
!
What
were
men
to
her
at
all
!
But
he
,
*NL*
ah
!
she
loved
his
soul
.
Was
HE
deficient
in
something
?
Perhaps
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
understand
,
''
she
said
huskily
.
``
Yesterday
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
turning
jangled
and
hateful
to
him
as
the
twilight
faded
.
*NL*
And
she
bowed
under
her
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
he
cried
,
``
you
never
will
!
You
'll
never
believe
that
I
*NL*
ca
n't
--
ca
n't
physically
,
any
more
than
I
can
fly
up
like
a
skylark
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
she
murmured
.
Now
she
dreaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hated
her
bitterly
at
that
moment
because
he
made
her
suffer
.
Love
*NL*
her
!
She
knew
he
loved
her
.
He
really
belonged
to
her
.
This
about
not
*NL*
loving
her
,
physically
,
bodily
,
was
a
mere
perversity
on
his
part
,
*NL*
because
he
knew
she
loved
him
.
He
was
stupid
like
a
child
.
He
belonged
*NL*
to
her
.
His
soul
wanted
her
.
She
guessed
somebody
had
been
influencing
*NL*
him
.
She
felt
upon
him
the
hardness
,
the
foreignness
of
another
*NL*
influence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
they
been
saying
at
home
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
that
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
knew
it
was
.
She
despised
them
for
their
commonness
,
his
*NL*
people
.
They
did
not
know
what
things
were
really
worth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
she
talked
very
little
more
that
night
.
After
all
he
left
her
to
*NL*
cycle
with
Edgar
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
come
back
to
his
mother
.
Hers
was
the
strongest
tie
in
his
life
.
*NL*
When
he
thought
round
,
Miriam
shrank
away
.
There
was
a
vague
,
unreal
*NL*
feel
about
her
.
And
nobody
else
mattered
.
There
was
one
place
in
the
*NL*
world
that
stood
solid
and
did
not
melt
into
unreality
:
the
place
where
*NL*
his
mother
was
.
Everybody
else
could
grow
shadowy
,
almost
non-existent
*NL*
to
him
,
but
she
could
not
.
It
was
as
if
the
pivot
and
pole
of
his
life
,
*NL*
from
which
he
could
not
escape
,
was
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
same
way
she
waited
for
him
.
In
him
was
established
her
life
*NL*
now
.
After
all
,
the
life
beyond
offered
very
little
to
Mrs.
Morel
.
She
*NL*
saw
that
our
chance
for
DOING
is
here
,
and
doing
counted
with
her
.
Paul
*NL*
was
going
to
prove
that
she
had
been
right
;
he
was
going
to
make
a
man
*NL*
whom
nothing
should
shift
off
his
feet
;
he
was
going
to
alter
the
face
*NL*
of
the
earth
in
some
way
which
mattered
.
Wherever
he
went
she
felt
her
*NL*
soul
went
with
him
.
Whatever
he
did
she
felt
her
soul
stood
by
him
,
*NL*
ready
,
as
it
were
,
to
hand
him
his
tools
.
She
could
not
bear
it
when
he
*NL*
was
with
Miriam
.
William
was
dead
.
She
would
fight
to
keep
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
came
back
to
her
.
And
in
his
soul
was
a
feeling
of
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
self-sacrifice
because
he
was
faithful
to
her
.
She
loved
*NL*
him
first
;
he
loved
her
first
.
And
yet
it
was
not
enough
.
His
new
young
*NL*
life
,
so
strong
and
imperious
,
was
urged
towards
something
else
.
It
made
*NL*
him
mad
with
restlessness
.
She
saw
this
,
and
wished
bitterly
that
Miriam
*NL*
had
been
a
woman
who
could
take
this
new
life
of
his
,
and
leave
her
the
*NL*
roots
.
He
fought
against
his
mother
almost
as
he
fought
against
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
week
before
he
went
again
to
Willey
Farm
.
Miriam
had
suffered
*NL*
a
great
deal
,
and
was
afraid
to
see
him
again
.
Was
she
now
to
endure
*NL*
the
ignominy
of
his
abandoning
her
?
That
would
only
be
superficial
*NL*
and
temporary
.
He
would
come
back
.
She
held
the
keys
to
his
soul
.
But
*NL*
meanwhile
,
how
he
would
torture
her
with
his
battle
against
her
.
She
*NL*
shrank
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
Sunday
after
Easter
he
came
to
tea
.
Mrs.
Leivers
was
glad
*NL*
to
see
him
.
She
gathered
something
was
fretting
him
,
that
he
found
*NL*
things
hard
.
He
seemed
to
drift
to
her
for
comfort
.
And
she
was
good
*NL*
to
him
.
She
did
him
that
great
kindness
of
treating
him
almost
with
*NL*
reverence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
met
her
with
the
young
children
in
the
front
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
've
come
,
''
said
the
mother
,
looking
at
him
with
her
great
*NL*
appealing
brown
eyes
.
``
It
is
such
a
sunny
day
.
I
was
just
going
down
the
*NL*
fields
for
the
first
time
this
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
she
would
like
him
to
come
.
That
soothed
him
.
They
went
,
talking
*NL*
simply
,
he
gentle
and
humble
.
He
could
have
wept
with
gratitude
that
she
*NL*
was
deferential
to
him
.
He
was
feeling
humiliated
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
bottom
of
the
Mow
Close
they
found
a
thrush
's
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
show
you
the
eggs
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
!
''
replied
Mrs.
Leivers
.
``
They
seem
SUCH
a
sign
of
spring
,
and
so
*NL*
hopeful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
aside
the
thorns
,
and
took
out
the
eggs
,
holding
them
in
the
palm
*NL*
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
quite
hot
--
I
think
we
frightened
her
off
them
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
poor
thing
!
''
said
Mrs.
Leivers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
could
not
help
touching
the
eggs
,
and
his
hand
which
,
it
seemed
*NL*
to
her
,
cradled
them
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
a
strange
warmth
!
''
she
murmured
,
to
get
near
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blood
heat
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
watched
him
putting
them
back
,
his
body
pressed
against
the
hedge
,
*NL*
his
arm
reaching
slowly
through
the
thorns
,
his
hand
folded
carefully
*NL*
over
the
eggs
.
He
was
concentrated
on
the
act
.
Seeing
him
so
,
she
loved
*NL*
him
;
he
seemed
so
simple
and
sufficient
to
himself
.
And
she
could
not
*NL*
get
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
she
stood
hesitating
at
the
bookshelf
.
He
took
``
Tartarin
de
*NL*
Tarascon
''
.
Again
they
sat
on
the
bank
of
hay
at
the
foot
of
the
stack
.
*NL*
He
read
a
couple
of
pages
,
but
without
any
heart
for
it
.
Again
the
dog
*NL*
came
racing
up
to
repeat
the
fun
of
the
other
day
.
He
shoved
his
muzzle
*NL*
in
the
man
's
chest
.
Paul
fingered
his
ear
for
a
moment
.
Then
he
pushed
*NL*
him
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
Bill
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
want
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bill
slunk
off
,
and
Miriam
wondered
and
dreaded
what
was
coming
.
There
*NL*
was
a
silence
about
the
youth
that
made
her
still
with
apprehension
.
It
*NL*
was
not
his
furies
,
but
his
quiet
resolutions
that
she
feared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
his
face
a
little
to
one
side
,
so
that
she
could
not
see
him
,
he
*NL*
began
,
speaking
slowly
and
painfully
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
--
if
I
did
n't
come
up
so
much
--
you
might
get
to
like
*NL*
somebody
else
--
another
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
this
was
what
he
was
still
harping
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
know
any
other
men
.
Why
do
you
ask
?
''
she
replied
,
in
a
low
*NL*
tone
that
should
have
been
a
reproach
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
he
blurted
,
``
because
they
say
I
've
no
right
to
come
up
like
*NL*
this
--
without
we
mean
to
marry
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
was
indignant
at
anybody
's
forcing
the
issues
between
them
.
She
*NL*
had
been
furious
with
her
own
father
for
suggesting
to
Paul
,
laughingly
,
*NL*
that
he
knew
why
he
came
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
says
?
''
she
asked
,
wondering
if
her
people
had
anything
to
do
with
*NL*
it
.
They
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
--
and
the
others
.
They
say
at
this
rate
everybody
will
consider
*NL*
me
engaged
,
and
I
ought
to
consider
myself
so
,
because
it
's
not
fair
to
*NL*
you
.
And
I
've
tried
to
find
out
--
and
I
do
n't
think
I
love
you
as
a
man
*NL*
ought
to
love
his
wife
.
What
do
you
think
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
bowed
her
head
moodily
.
She
was
angry
at
having
this
struggle
.
*NL*
People
should
leave
him
and
her
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
we
love
each
other
enough
to
marry
?
''
he
asked
definitely
.
*NL*
It
made
her
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
truthfully
.
``
I
do
n't
think
so
--
we
're
too
young
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
perhaps
,
''
he
went
on
miserably
,
``
that
you
,
with
your
*NL*
intensity
in
things
,
might
have
given
me
more
--
than
I
could
ever
make
up
*NL*
to
you
.
And
even
now
--
if
you
think
it
better
--
we
'll
be
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Miriam
wanted
to
cry
.
And
she
was
angry
,
too
.
He
was
always
such
a
*NL*
child
for
people
to
do
as
they
liked
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
think
so
,
''
she
said
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pondered
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
he
said
,
``
with
me
--
I
do
n't
think
one
person
would
ever
*NL*
monopolize
me
--
be
everything
to
me
--
I
think
never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
she
did
not
consider
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
murmured
.
Then
,
after
a
pause
,
she
looked
at
him
,
and
her
dark
*NL*
eyes
flashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
your
mother
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
know
she
never
liked
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
it
is
n't
,
''
he
said
hastily
.
``
It
was
for
your
sake
she
spoke
*NL*
this
time
.
She
only
said
,
if
I
was
going
on
,
I
ought
to
consider
myself
*NL*
engaged
.
''
There
was
a
silence
.
``
And
if
I
ask
you
to
come
down
any
time
,
*NL*
you
wo
n't
stop
away
,
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
By
this
time
she
was
very
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
shall
we
do
?
''
she
said
shortly
.
``
I
suppose
I
'd
better
drop
*NL*
French
.
I
was
just
beginning
to
get
on
with
it
.
But
I
suppose
I
can
go
*NL*
on
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
that
we
need
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
can
give
you
a
French
lesson
,
*NL*
surely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
and
there
are
Sunday
nights
.
I
sha
n't
stop
coming
to
chapel
,
*NL*
because
I
enjoy
it
,
and
it
's
all
the
social
life
I
get
.
But
you
've
no
*NL*
need
to
come
home
with
me
.
I
can
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
answered
,
rather
taken
aback
.
``
But
if
I
ask
Edgar
,
he
'll
*NL*
always
come
with
us
,
and
then
they
can
say
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
.
After
all
,
then
,
she
would
not
lose
much
.
For
all
*NL*
their
talk
down
at
his
home
there
would
not
be
much
difference
.
She
*NL*
wished
they
would
mind
their
own
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
wo
n't
think
about
it
,
and
let
it
trouble
you
,
will
you
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
''
replied
Miriam
,
without
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
.
She
thought
him
unstable
.
He
had
no
fixity
of
purpose
,
no
*NL*
anchor
of
righteousness
that
held
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
he
continued
,
``
a
man
gets
across
his
bicycle
--
and
goes
to
*NL*
work
--
and
does
all
sorts
of
things
.
But
a
woman
broods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
sha
n't
bother
,
''
said
Miriam
.
And
she
meant
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
gone
rather
chilly
.
They
went
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
white
Paul
looks
!
''
Mrs.
Leivers
exclaimed
.
``
Miriam
,
you
should
n't
*NL*
have
let
him
sit
out
of
doors
.
Do
you
think
you
've
taken
cold
,
Paul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
felt
done
up
.
It
wore
him
out
,
the
conflict
in
himself
.
Miriam
*NL*
pitied
him
now
.
But
quite
early
,
before
nine
o'clock
,
he
rose
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
going
home
,
are
you
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Leivers
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
.
``
I
said
I
'd
be
early
.
''
He
was
very
awkward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
IS
early
,
''
said
Mrs.
Leivers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
sat
in
the
rocking-chair
,
and
did
not
speak
.
He
hesitated
,
*NL*
expecting
her
to
rise
and
go
with
him
to
the
barn
as
usual
for
his
*NL*
bicycle
.
She
remained
as
she
was
.
He
was
at
a
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
good-night
,
all
!
''
he
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
her
good-night
along
with
all
the
others
.
But
as
he
went
past
*NL*
the
window
he
looked
in
.
She
saw
him
pale
,
his
brows
knit
slightly
in
a
*NL*
way
that
had
become
constant
with
him
,
his
eyes
dark
with
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
and
went
to
the
doorway
to
wave
good-bye
to
him
as
he
passed
*NL*
through
the
gate
.
He
rode
slowly
under
the
pine-trees
,
feeling
a
cur
and
*NL*
a
miserable
wretch
.
His
bicycle
went
tilting
down
the
hills
at
random
.
*NL*
He
thought
it
would
be
a
relief
to
break
one
's
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
later
he
sent
her
up
a
book
and
a
little
note
,
urging
her
to
*NL*
read
and
be
busy
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
he
gave
all
his
friendship
to
Edgar
.
He
loved
the
family
*NL*
so
much
,
he
loved
the
farm
so
much
;
it
was
the
dearest
place
on
earth
to
*NL*
him
.
His
home
was
not
so
lovable
.
It
was
his
mother
.
But
then
he
would
*NL*
have
been
just
as
happy
with
his
mother
anywhere
.
Whereas
Willey
Farm
he
*NL*
loved
passionately
.
He
loved
the
little
pokey
kitchen
,
where
men
's
boots
*NL*
tramped
,
and
the
dog
slept
with
one
eye
open
for
fear
of
being
trodden
*NL*
on
;
where
the
lamp
hung
over
the
table
at
night
,
and
everything
was
*NL*
so
silent
.
He
loved
Miriam
's
long
,
low
parlour
,
with
its
atmosphere
of
*NL*
romance
,
its
flowers
,
its
books
,
its
high
rosewood
piano
.
He
loved
the
*NL*
gardens
and
the
buildings
that
stood
with
their
scarlet
roofs
on
the
*NL*
naked
edges
of
the
fields
,
crept
towards
the
wood
as
if
for
cosiness
,
*NL*
the
wild
country
scooping
down
a
valley
and
up
the
uncultured
hills
of
*NL*
the
other
side
.
Only
to
be
there
was
an
exhilaration
and
a
joy
to
him
.
*NL*
He
loved
Mrs.
Leivers
,
with
her
unworldliness
and
her
quaint
cynicism
;
*NL*
he
loved
Mr.
Leivers
,
so
warm
and
young
and
lovable
;
he
loved
Edgar
,
who
*NL*
lit
up
when
he
came
,
and
the
boys
and
the
children
and
Bill
--
even
the
*NL*
sow
Circe
and
the
Indian
game-cock
called
Tippoo
.
All
this
besides
*NL*
Miriam
.
He
could
not
give
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
went
as
often
,
but
he
was
usually
with
Edgar
.
Only
all
the
family
,
*NL*
including
the
father
,
joined
in
charades
and
games
at
evening
.
And
*NL*
later
,
Miriam
drew
them
together
,
and
they
read
Macbeth
out
of
penny
*NL*
books
,
taking
parts
.
It
was
great
excitement
.
Miriam
was
glad
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Leivers
was
glad
,
and
Mr.
Leivers
enjoyed
it
.
Then
they
all
learned
*NL*
songs
together
from
tonic
sol-fa
,
singing
in
a
circle
round
the
fire
.
*NL*
But
now
Paul
was
very
rarely
alone
with
Miriam
.
She
waited
.
When
she
*NL*
and
Edgar
and
he
walked
home
together
from
chapel
or
from
the
literary
*NL*
society
in
Bestwood
,
she
knew
his
talk
,
so
passionate
and
so
unorthodox
*NL*
nowadays
,
was
for
her
.
She
did
envy
Edgar
,
however
,
his
cycling
with
*NL*
Paul
,
his
Friday
nights
,
his
days
working
in
the
fields
.
For
her
Friday
*NL*
nights
and
her
French
lessons
were
gone
.
She
was
nearly
always
alone
,
*NL*
walking
,
pondering
in
the
wood
,
reading
,
studying
,
dreaming
,
waiting
.
*NL*
And
he
wrote
to
her
frequently
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Sunday
evening
they
attained
to
their
old
rare
harmony
.
Edgar
had
*NL*
stayed
to
Communion
--
he
wondered
what
it
was
like
--
with
Mrs.
Morel
.
So
*NL*
Paul
came
on
alone
with
Miriam
to
his
home
.
He
was
more
or
less
under
*NL*
her
spell
again
.
As
usual
,
they
were
discussing
the
sermon
.
He
was
*NL*
setting
now
full
sail
towards
Agnosticism
,
but
such
a
religious
*NL*
Agnosticism
that
Miriam
did
not
suffer
so
badly
.
They
were
at
the
Renan
*NL*
Vie
de
Jesus
stage
.
Miriam
was
the
threshing-floor
on
which
he
threshed
*NL*
out
all
his
beliefs
.
While
he
trampled
his
ideas
upon
her
soul
,
the
*NL*
truth
came
out
for
him
.
She
alone
was
his
threshing-floor
.
She
alone
*NL*
helped
him
towards
realization
.
Almost
impassive
,
she
submitted
to
*NL*
his
argument
and
expounding
.
And
somehow
,
because
of
her
,
he
gradually
*NL*
realized
where
he
was
wrong
.
And
what
he
realized
,
she
realized
.
She
*NL*
felt
he
could
not
do
without
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
to
the
silent
house
.
He
took
the
key
out
of
the
scullery
*NL*
window
,
and
they
entered
.
All
the
time
he
went
on
with
his
discussion
.
*NL*
He
lit
the
gas
,
mended
the
fire
,
and
brought
her
some
cakes
from
the
*NL*
pantry
.
She
sat
on
the
sofa
,
quietly
,
with
a
plate
on
her
knee
.
She
wore
*NL*
a
large
white
hat
with
some
pinkish
flowers
.
It
was
a
cheap
hat
,
but
*NL*
he
liked
it
.
Her
face
beneath
was
still
and
pensive
,
golden-brown
and
*NL*
ruddy
.
Always
her
ears
were
hid
in
her
short
curls
.
She
watched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
liked
him
on
Sundays
.
Then
he
wore
a
dark
suit
that
showed
the
lithe
*NL*
movement
of
his
body
.
There
was
a
clean
,
clear-cut
look
about
him
.
*NL*
He
went
on
with
his
thinking
to
her
.
Suddenly
he
reached
for
a
Bible
.
*NL*
Miriam
liked
the
way
he
reached
up
--
so
sharp
,
straight
to
the
mark
.
He
*NL*
turned
the
pages
quickly
,
and
read
her
a
chapter
of
St.
John
.
As
he
sat
*NL*
in
the
armchair
reading
,
intent
,
his
voice
only
thinking
,
she
felt
as
if
*NL*
he
were
using
her
unconsciously
as
a
man
uses
his
tools
at
some
work
he
*NL*
is
bent
on
.
She
loved
it
.
And
the
wistfulness
of
his
voice
was
like
a
*NL*
reaching
to
something
,
and
it
was
as
if
she
were
what
he
reached
with
.
*NL*
She
sat
back
on
the
sofa
away
from
him
,
and
yet
feeling
herself
the
very
*NL*
instrument
his
hand
grasped
.
It
gave
her
great
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
began
to
falter
and
to
get
self-conscious
.
And
when
he
came
to
*NL*
the
verse
,
``
A
woman
,
when
she
is
in
travail
,
hath
sorrow
because
*NL*
her
hour
is
come
''
,
he
missed
it
out
.
Miriam
had
felt
him
growing
*NL*
uncomfortable
.
She
shrank
when
the
well-known
words
did
not
follow
.
He
*NL*
went
on
reading
,
but
she
did
not
hear
.
A
grief
and
shame
made
her
bend
*NL*
her
head
.
Six
months
ago
he
would
have
read
it
simply
.
Now
there
was
a
*NL*
scotch
in
his
running
with
her
.
Now
she
felt
there
was
really
something
*NL*
hostile
between
them
,
something
of
which
they
were
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ate
her
cake
mechanically
.
He
tried
to
go
on
with
his
argument
,
but
*NL*
could
not
get
back
the
right
note
.
Soon
Edgar
came
in
.
Mrs.
Morel
had
*NL*
gone
to
her
friends
'
.
The
three
set
off
to
Willey
Farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
brooded
over
his
split
with
her
.
There
was
something
else
he
*NL*
wanted
.
He
could
not
be
satisfied
;
he
could
give
her
no
peace
.
There
was
*NL*
between
them
now
always
a
ground
for
strife
.
She
wanted
to
prove
him
.
*NL*
She
believed
that
his
chief
need
in
life
was
herself
.
If
she
could
prove
*NL*
it
,
both
to
herself
and
to
him
,
the
rest
might
go
;
she
could
simply
*NL*
trust
to
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
in
May
she
asked
him
to
come
to
Willey
Farm
and
meet
Mrs.
Dawes
.
*NL*
There
was
something
he
hankered
after
.
She
saw
him
,
whenever
they
spoke
*NL*
of
Clara
Dawes
,
rouse
and
get
slightly
angry
.
He
said
he
did
not
like
*NL*
her
.
Yet
he
was
keen
to
know
about
her
.
Well
,
he
should
put
himself
to
*NL*
the
test
.
She
believed
that
there
were
in
him
desires
for
higher
things
,
*NL*
and
desires
for
lower
,
and
that
the
desire
for
the
higher
would
conquer
.
*NL*
At
any
rate
,
he
should
try
.
She
forgot
that
her
``
higher
''
and
``
lower
''
*NL*
were
arbitrary
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
rather
excited
at
the
idea
of
meeting
Clara
at
Willey
Farm
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Dawes
came
for
the
day
.
Her
heavy
,
dun-coloured
hair
was
coiled
on
*NL*
top
of
her
head
.
She
wore
a
white
blouse
and
navy
skirt
,
and
somehow
,
*NL*
wherever
she
was
,
seemed
to
make
things
look
paltry
and
insignificant
.
*NL*
When
she
was
in
the
room
,
the
kitchen
seemed
too
small
and
mean
*NL*
altogether
.
Miriam
's
beautiful
twilighty
parlour
looked
stiff
and
*NL*
stupid
.
All
the
Leivers
were
eclipsed
like
candles
.
They
found
*NL*
her
rather
hard
to
put
up
with
.
Yet
she
was
perfectly
amiable
,
but
*NL*
indifferent
,
and
rather
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
did
not
come
till
afternoon
.
He
was
early
.
As
he
swung
off
his
*NL*
bicycle
,
Miriam
saw
him
look
round
at
the
house
eagerly
.
He
would
be
*NL*
disappointed
if
the
visitor
had
not
come
.
Miriam
went
out
to
meet
him
,
*NL*
bowing
her
head
because
of
the
sunshine
.
Nasturtiums
were
coming
out
*NL*
crimson
under
the
cool
green
shadow
of
their
leaves
.
The
girl
stood
,
*NL*
dark-haired
,
glad
to
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
n't
Clara
come
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Miriam
in
her
musical
tone
.
``
She
's
reading
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wheeled
his
bicycle
into
the
barn
.
He
had
put
on
a
handsome
tie
,
of
*NL*
which
he
was
rather
proud
,
and
socks
to
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
came
this
morning
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Miriam
,
as
she
walked
at
his
side
.
``
You
said
you
'd
bring
*NL*
me
that
letter
from
the
man
at
Liberty
's
.
Have
you
remembered
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dash
,
no
!
''
he
said
.
``
But
nag
at
me
till
you
get
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
nag
at
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
it
whether
or
not
.
And
is
she
any
more
agreeable
?
''
he
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
always
think
she
is
quite
agreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
.
Evidently
his
eagerness
to
be
early
to-day
had
been
the
*NL*
newcomer
.
Miriam
already
began
to
suffer
.
They
went
together
towards
the
*NL*
house
.
He
took
the
clips
off
his
trousers
,
but
was
too
lazy
to
brush
the
*NL*
dust
from
his
shoes
,
in
spite
of
the
socks
and
tie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
sat
in
the
cool
parlour
reading
.
He
saw
the
nape
of
her
white
*NL*
neck
,
and
the
fine
hair
lifted
from
it
.
She
rose
,
looking
at
him
*NL*
indifferently
.
To
shake
hands
she
lifted
her
arm
straight
,
in
a
*NL*
manner
that
seemed
at
once
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
,
and
yet
to
fling
*NL*
something
to
him
.
He
noticed
how
her
breasts
swelled
inside
her
blouse
,
*NL*
and
how
her
shoulder
curved
handsomely
under
the
thin
muslin
at
the
top
*NL*
of
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
chosen
a
fine
day
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
happens
so
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
am
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
,
not
thanking
him
for
his
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
been
doing
all
morning
?
''
asked
Paul
of
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
''
said
Miriam
,
coughing
huskily
,
``
Clara
only
came
with
*NL*
father
--
and
so
--
she
's
not
been
here
very
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
sat
leaning
on
the
table
,
holding
aloof
.
He
noticed
her
hands
were
*NL*
large
,
but
well
kept
.
And
the
skin
on
them
seemed
almost
coarse
,
opaque
,
*NL*
and
white
,
with
fine
golden
hairs
.
She
did
not
mind
if
he
observed
her
*NL*
hands
.
She
intended
to
scorn
him
.
Her
heavy
arm
lay
negligently
on
the
*NL*
table
.
Her
mouth
was
closed
as
if
she
were
offended
,
and
she
kept
her
*NL*
face
slightly
averted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
at
Margaret
Bonford
's
meeting
the
other
evening
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
did
not
know
this
courteous
Paul
.
Clara
glanced
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
asked
Miriam
,
``
how
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
in
for
a
few
minutes
before
the
train
came
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
turned
away
again
rather
disdainfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
she
's
a
lovable
little
woman
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Margaret
Bonford
!
''
exclaimed
Clara
.
``
She
's
a
great
deal
cleverer
than
*NL*
most
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
n't
say
she
was
n't
,
''
he
said
,
deprecating
.
``
She
's
lovable
*NL*
for
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
of
course
,
that
is
all
that
matters
,
''
said
Clara
witheringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rubbed
his
head
,
rather
perplexed
,
rather
annoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
matters
more
than
her
cleverness
,
''
he
said
;
``
which
,
after
*NL*
all
,
would
never
get
her
to
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
heaven
she
wants
to
get
--
it
's
her
fair
share
on
earth
,
''
*NL*
retorted
Clara
.
She
spoke
as
if
he
were
responsible
for
some
deprivation
*NL*
which
Miss
Bonford
suffered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
thought
she
was
warm
,
and
awfully
nice
--
only
too
*NL*
frail
.
I
wished
she
was
sitting
comfortably
in
peace
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Darning
her
husband
's
stockings
,
'
''
said
Clara
scathingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
she
would
n't
mind
darning
even
my
stockings
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
*NL*
I
'm
sure
she
'd
do
them
well
.
Just
as
I
would
n't
mind
blacking
her
boots
*NL*
if
she
wanted
me
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Clara
refused
to
answer
this
sally
of
his
.
He
talked
to
Miriam
for
a
*NL*
little
while
.
The
other
woman
held
aloof
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
think
I
'll
go
and
see
Edgar
.
Is
he
on
the
land
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
,
''
said
Miriam
,
``
he
's
gone
for
a
load
of
coal
.
He
should
be
*NL*
back
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'll
go
and
meet
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
dared
not
propose
anything
for
the
three
of
them
.
He
rose
and
*NL*
left
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
top
road
,
where
the
gorse
was
out
,
he
saw
Edgar
walking
lazily
*NL*
beside
the
mare
,
who
nodded
her
white-starred
forehead
as
she
dragged
*NL*
the
clanking
load
of
coal
.
The
young
farmer
's
face
lighted
up
as
he
saw
*NL*
his
friend
.
Edgar
was
good-looking
,
with
dark
,
warm
eyes
.
His
clothes
*NL*
were
old
and
rather
disreputable
,
and
he
walked
with
considerable
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
he
said
,
seeing
Paul
bareheaded
.
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Came
to
meet
you
.
Ca
n't
stand
`
Nevermore
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edgar
's
teeth
flashed
in
a
laugh
of
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
`
Nevermore
'
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lady
--
Mrs.
Dawes
--
it
ought
to
be
Mrs.
The
Raven
that
quothed
*NL*
`
Nevermore
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edgar
laughed
with
glee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
like
her
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
fat
lot
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
Why
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
The
answer
came
with
a
deep
ring
of
conviction
.
``
No
!
''
Edgar
pursed
*NL*
up
his
lips
.
``
I
ca
n't
say
she
's
much
in
my
line
.
''
He
mused
a
little
.
*NL*
Then
:
``
But
why
do
you
call
her
`
Nevermore
'
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
if
she
looks
at
a
man
she
says
haughtily
*NL*
`
Nevermore
,
'
and
if
she
looks
at
herself
in
the
looking-glass
she
says
*NL*
disdainfully
`
Nevermore
,
'
and
if
she
thinks
back
she
says
it
in
disgust
,
*NL*
and
if
she
looks
forward
she
says
it
cynically
.

Edgar
considered
this
speech
,
failed
to
make
much
out
of
it
,
and
said
,
*NL*
laughing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
she
's
a
man-hater
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
SHE
thinks
she
is
,
''
replied
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
n't
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
she
nice
with
you
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
imagine
her
NICE
with
anybody
?
''
asked
the
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edgar
laughed
.
Together
they
unloaded
the
coal
in
the
yard
.
Paul
was
*NL*
rather
self-conscious
,
because
he
knew
Clara
could
see
if
she
looked
out
*NL*
of
the
window
.
She
did
n't
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Saturday
afternoons
the
horses
were
brushed
down
and
groomed
.
Paul
*NL*
and
Edgar
worked
together
,
sneezing
with
the
dust
that
came
from
the
*NL*
pelts
of
Jimmy
and
Flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
a
new
song
to
teach
me
?
''
said
Edgar
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
work
all
the
time
.
The
back
of
his
neck
was
sun-red
*NL*
when
he
bent
down
,
and
his
fingers
that
held
the
brush
were
thick
.
Paul
*NL*
watched
him
sometimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Mary
Morrison
'
?
''
suggested
the
younger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edgar
agreed
.
He
had
a
good
tenor
voice
,
and
he
loved
to
learn
all
the
*NL*
songs
his
friend
could
teach
him
,
so
that
he
could
sing
whilst
he
was
*NL*
carting
.
Paul
had
a
very
indifferent
baritone
voice
,
but
a
good
ear
.
*NL*
However
,
he
sang
softly
,
for
fear
of
Clara
.
Edgar
repeated
the
line
in
a
*NL*
clear
tenor
.
At
times
they
both
broke
off
to
sneeze
,
and
first
one
,
then
*NL*
the
other
,
abused
his
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
was
impatient
of
men
.
It
took
so
little
to
amuse
them
--
even
Paul
.
*NL*
She
thought
it
anomalous
in
him
that
he
could
be
so
thoroughly
absorbed
*NL*
in
a
triviality
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
tea-time
when
they
had
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
song
was
that
?
''
asked
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edgar
told
her
.
The
conversation
turned
to
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
such
jolly
times
,
''
Miriam
said
to
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dawes
ate
her
meal
in
a
slow
,
dignified
way
.
Whenever
the
men
were
*NL*
present
she
grew
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
singing
?
''
Miriam
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
good
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
,
of
course
,
coloured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
if
it
is
high-class
and
trained
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
a
voice
needs
training
before
the
singing
is
anything
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
as
well
insist
on
having
people
's
voices
trained
before
you
*NL*
allowed
them
to
talk
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Really
,
people
sing
for
their
own
*NL*
pleasure
,
as
a
rule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
may
be
for
other
people
's
discomfort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
other
people
should
have
flaps
to
their
ears
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
laughed
.
There
was
a
silence
.
He
flushed
deeply
,
and
ate
in
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
,
when
all
the
men
had
gone
but
Paul
,
Mrs.
Leivers
said
to
*NL*
Clara
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
find
life
happier
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Infinitely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
satisfied
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
long
as
I
can
be
free
and
independent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
do
n't
MISS
anything
in
your
life
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Leivers
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
put
all
that
behind
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
had
been
feeling
uncomfortable
during
this
discourse
.
He
got
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
find
you
're
always
tumbling
over
the
things
you
've
put
behind
*NL*
you
,
''
he
said
.
Then
he
took
his
departure
to
the
cowsheds
.
He
felt
he
*NL*
had
been
witty
,
and
his
manly
pride
was
high
.
He
whistled
as
he
went
*NL*
down
the
brick
track
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
came
for
him
a
little
later
to
know
if
he
would
go
with
Clara
and
*NL*
her
for
a
walk
.
They
set
off
down
to
Strelley
Mill
Farm
.
As
they
were
*NL*
going
beside
the
brook
,
on
the
Willey
Water
side
,
looking
through
the
*NL*
brake
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
,
where
pink
campions
glowed
under
a
few
*NL*
sunbeams
,
they
saw
,
beyond
the
tree-trunks
and
the
thin
hazel
bushes
,
*NL*
a
man
leading
a
great
bay
horse
through
the
gullies
.
The
big
red
beast
*NL*
seemed
to
dance
romantically
through
that
dimness
of
green
hazel
drift
,
*NL*
away
there
where
the
air
was
shadowy
,
as
if
it
were
in
the
past
,
among
*NL*
the
fading
bluebells
that
might
have
bloomed
for
Deidre
or
Iseult
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
stood
charmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
treat
to
be
a
knight
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
to
have
a
pavilion
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
have
us
shut
up
safely
?
''
replied
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
answered
,
``
singing
with
your
maids
at
your
broidery
.
I
would
*NL*
carry
your
banner
of
white
and
green
and
heliotrope
.
I
would
have
*NL*
`
W.S.P.U.
'
emblazoned
on
my
shield
,
beneath
a
woman
rampant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
doubt
,
''
said
Clara
,
``
that
you
would
much
rather
fight
for
a
*NL*
woman
than
let
her
fight
for
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
.
When
she
fights
for
herself
she
seems
like
a
dog
before
a
*NL*
looking-glass
,
gone
into
a
mad
fury
with
its
own
shadow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
YOU
are
the
looking-glass
?
''
she
asked
,
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
the
shadow
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
you
are
too
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
leave
it
to
you
to
be
GOOD
,
''
he
retorted
,
laughing
.
``
Be
good
,
*NL*
sweet
maid
,
and
just
let
ME
be
clever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Clara
wearied
of
his
flippancy
.
Suddenly
,
looking
at
her
,
he
saw
*NL*
that
the
upward
lifting
of
her
face
was
misery
and
not
scorn
.
His
heart
*NL*
grew
tender
for
everybody
.
He
turned
and
was
gentle
with
Miriam
,
whom
he
*NL*
had
neglected
till
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
wood
's
edge
they
met
Limb
,
a
thin
,
swarthy
man
of
forty
,
tenant
*NL*
of
Strelley
Mill
,
which
he
ran
as
a
cattle-raising
farm
.
He
held
the
*NL*
halter
of
the
powerful
stallion
indifferently
,
as
if
he
were
tired
.
The
*NL*
three
stood
to
let
him
pass
over
the
stepping-stones
of
the
first
brook
.
*NL*
Paul
admired
that
so
large
an
animal
should
walk
on
such
springy
toes
,
*NL*
with
an
endless
excess
of
vigour
.
Limb
pulled
up
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
your
father
,
Miss
Leivers
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
peculiar
piping
voice
,
*NL*
``
that
his
young
beas
`
es
`
as
broke
that
bottom
fence
three
days
an

*NL*
runnin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
?
''
asked
Miriam
,
tremulous
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
horse
breathed
heavily
,
shifting
round
its
red
flanks
,
and
*NL*
looking
suspiciously
with
its
wonderful
big
eyes
upwards
from
under
its
*NL*
lowered
head
and
falling
mane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
a
bit
,
''
replied
Limb
,
``
an
'
I
'll
show
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
and
the
stallion
went
forward
.
It
danced
sideways
,
shaking
its
*NL*
white
fetlocks
and
looking
frightened
,
as
it
felt
itself
in
the
brook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
hanky-pankyin
'
,
''
said
the
man
affectionately
to
the
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
went
up
the
bank
in
little
leaps
,
then
splashed
finely
through
the
*NL*
second
brook
.
Clara
,
walking
with
a
kind
of
sulky
abandon
,
watched
it
*NL*
half-fascinated
,
half-contemptuous
.
Limb
stopped
and
pointed
to
the
*NL*
fence
under
some
willows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
where
they
got
through
,
''
he
said
.
``
My
man
's
druv
'em
*NL*
back
three
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Miriam
,
colouring
as
if
she
were
at
fault
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
comin
'
in
?
''
asked
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thanks
;
but
we
should
like
to
go
by
the
pond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
just
as
you
've
a
mind
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
gave
little
whinneys
of
pleasure
at
being
so
near
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
glad
to
be
back
,
''
said
Clara
,
who
was
interested
in
the
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
`
e
's
been
a
tidy
step
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
through
the
gate
,
and
saw
approaching
them
from
the
*NL*
big
farmhouse
a
smallish
,
dark
,
excitable-looking
woman
of
about
*NL*
thirty-five
.
Her
hair
was
touched
with
grey
,
her
dark
eyes
looked
wild
.
*NL*
She
walked
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
.
Her
brother
went
forward
.
As
*NL*
it
saw
her
,
the
big
bay
stallion
whinneyed
again
.
She
came
up
excitedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
home
again
,
my
boy
!
''
she
said
tenderly
to
the
horse
,
not
to
*NL*
the
man
.
The
great
beast
shifted
round
to
her
,
ducking
his
head
.
She
*NL*
smuggled
into
his
mouth
the
wrinkled
yellow
apple
she
had
been
hiding
*NL*
behind
her
back
,
then
she
kissed
him
near
the
eyes
.
He
gave
a
big
sigh
*NL*
of
pleasure
.
She
held
his
head
in
her
arms
against
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
he
splendid
!
''
said
Miriam
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Limb
looked
up
.
Her
dark
eyes
glanced
straight
at
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
good-evening
,
Miss
Leivers
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
's
ages
since
you
've
been
*NL*
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
introduced
her
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
horse
IS
a
fine
fellow
!
''
said
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
he
!
''
Again
she
kissed
him
.
``
As
loving
as
any
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
loving
than
most
men
,
I
should
think
,
''
replied
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
nice
boy
!
''
cried
the
woman
,
again
embracing
the
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
,
fascinated
by
the
big
beast
,
went
up
to
stroke
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
quite
gentle
,
''
said
Miss
Limb
.
``
Do
n't
you
think
big
fellows
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
beauty
!
''
replied
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
look
in
his
eyes
.
She
wanted
him
to
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
he
ca
n't
talk
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
he
can
--
all
but
,
''
replied
the
other
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
her
brother
moved
on
with
the
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
coming
in
?
DO
come
in
,
Mr.
--
I
did
n't
catch
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morel

''
said
Miriam
.
``
No

we
wo
n't
come
in

but
we
should
like

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes

do

Do

fish
,
Mr.
Morel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
if
you
do
you
might
come
and
fish
any
time

said
Miss
Limb
.
*NL*
``
We
scarcely
see
a
soul

end

end

I
should
be
*NL*
thankful

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
fish
are
there
in
the
pond
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
through
the
front
garden
,
over
the
sluice
,
and
up
the
steep
*NL*
bank
to
the
pond
,
which
lay
in
shadow
,
with
its
two
wooded
islets
.
Paul
*NL*
walked
with
Miss
Limb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
mind
swimming
here
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

''
she
replied
.
``
Come
when
you
like

My
brother
will
be
awfully
*NL*
pleased
to
talk

He
is
so
quiet

because
there
is
no
one

talk
to

Do
come
and
swim

''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
fine
depth
,
''
she
said
,
``
and
so
clear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Miss
Limb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
swim

''
said
Paul
.
``
Miss
Limb
was
just
saying
we
could
come
when
*NL*
we
liked

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
there
's
the
farm-hands
,
''
said
Miss
Limb
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
a
few
moments
,
then
went
on
up
the
wild
hill
,
leaving
the
*NL*
lonely
,
haggard-eyed
woman
on
the
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hillside
was
all
ripe
with
sunshine
.
It
was
wild
and
tussocky
,
given
*NL*
over
to
rabbits
.
The
three
walked
in
silence
.
Then
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
makes
me
feel
uncomfortable
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
Miss
Limb
?

asked
Miriam
.
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a
matter
with
her
?
Is
she
going
dotty
with
being
too
lonely

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
said
Miriam
.
``
It
's
not
the
right
sort
of
life
for
her
.
I
think
*NL*
it
's
cruel
to
bury
her
there
.
I
really
ought
to
go
and
see
her
more
.
*NL*
But
--
she
upsets
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
makes
me
feel
sorry
for
her
--
yes
,
and
she
bothers
me
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
''
blurted
Clara
suddenly
,
``
she
wants
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
two
were
silent
for
a
few
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
the
loneliness
sends
her
cracked
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
did
not
answer
,
but
strode
on
uphill
.
She
was
walking
with
her
*NL*
hand
hanging
,
her
legs
swinging
as
she
kicked
through
the
dead
thistles
*NL*
and
the
tussocky
grass
,
her
arms
hanging
loose
.
Rather
than
walking
,
her
*NL*
handsome
body
seemed
to
be
blundering
up
the
hill
.
A
hot
wave
went
over
*NL*
Paul
.
He
was
curious
about
her
.
Perhaps
life
had
been
cruel
to
her
.
He
*NL*
forgot
Miriam
,
who
was
walking
beside
him
talking
to
him
.
She
glanced
at
*NL*
him
,
finding
he
did
not
answer
her
.
His
eyes
were
fixed
ahead
on
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
still
think
she
is
disagreeable
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
notice
that
the
question
was
sudden
.
It
ran
with
his
*NL*
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
's
the
matter
with
her
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
at
the
top
of
the
hill
a
hidden
wild
field
,
two
sides
of
*NL*
which
were
backed
by
the
wood
,
the
other
sides
by
high
loose
hedges
of
*NL*
hawthorn
and
elder
bushes
.
Between
these
overgrown
bushes
were
gaps
*NL*
that
the
cattle
might
have
walked
through
had
there
been
any
cattle
now
.
*NL*
There
the
turf
was
smooth
as
velveteen
,
padded
and
holed
by
the
rabbits
.
*NL*
The
field
itself
was
coarse
,
and
crowded
with
tall
,
big
cowslips
that
*NL*
had
never
been
cut
.
Clusters
of
strong
flowers
rose
everywhere
above
the
*NL*
coarse
tussocks
of
bent
.
It
was
like
a
roadstead
crowded
with
tan
,
fairy
*NL*
shipping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
Miriam
,
and
she
looked
at
Paul
,
her
dark
eyes
dilating
.
He
*NL*
smiled
.
Together
they
enjoyed
the
field
of
flowers
.
Clara
,
a
little
way
*NL*
off
,
was
looking
at
the
cowslips
disconsolately
.
Paul
and
Miriam
stayed
*NL*
close
together
,
talking
in
subdued
tones
.
He
kneeled
on
one
knee
,
*NL*
quickly
gathering
the
best
blossoms
,
moving
from
tuft
to
tuft
*NL*
restlessly
,
talking
softly
all
the
time
.
Miriam
plucked
the
flowers
*NL*
lovingly
,
lingering
over
them
.
He
always
seemed
to
her
too
quick
and
*NL*
almost
scientific
.
Yet
his
bunches
had
a
natural
beauty
more
than
hers
.
*NL*
He
loved
them
,
but
as
if
they
were
his
and
he
had
a
right
to
them
.
She
*NL*
had
more
reverence
for
them
:
they
held
something
she
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flowers
were
very
fresh
and
sweet
.
He
wanted
to
drink
them
.
As
*NL*
he
gathered
them
,
he
ate
the
little
yellow
trumpets
.
Clara
was
still
*NL*
wandering
about
disconsolately
.
Going
towards
her
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
get
some
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
in
it
.
They
look
better
growing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'd
like
some
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
want
to
be
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
they
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
the
corpses
of
flowers
about
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
stiff
,
artificial
notion
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
do
n't
die
any
*NL*
quicker
in
water
than
on
their
roots
.
And
besides
,
they
LOOK
nice
in
*NL*
a
bowl
--
they
look
jolly
.
And
you
only
call
a
thing
a
corpse
because
it
*NL*
looks
corpse-like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
it
is
one
or
not
?
''
she
argued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
one
to
me
.
A
dead
flower
is
n't
a
corpse
of
a
flower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
now
ignored
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
even
so
--
what
right
have
you
to
pull
them
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
like
them
,
and
want
them
--
and
there
's
plenty
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
is
sufficient
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Why
not
?
I
'm
sure
they
'd
smell
nice
in
your
room
in
Nottingham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
should
have
the
pleasure
of
watching
them
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
then
--
it
does
not
matter
if
they
do
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
he
left
her
,
and
went
stooping
over
the
clumps
of
tangled
*NL*
flowers
which
thickly
sprinkled
the
field
like
pale
,
luminous
*NL*
foam-clots
.
Miriam
had
come
close
.
Clara
was
kneeling
,
breathing
some
*NL*
scent
from
the
cowslips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
Miriam
,
``
if
you
treat
them
with
reverence
you
do
n't
do
*NL*
them
any
harm
.
It
is
the
spirit
you
pluck
them
in
that
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
no
,
you
get
'em
because
you
want
'em
,
and
that
's
*NL*
all
.
''
He
held
out
his
bunch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
was
silent
.
He
picked
some
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
these
!
''
he
continued
;
``
sturdy
and
lusty
like
little
trees
and
*NL*
like
boys
with
fat
legs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
's
hat
lay
on
the
grass
not
far
off
.
She
was
kneeling
,
bending
*NL*
forward
still
to
smell
the
flowers
.
Her
neck
gave
him
a
sharp
pang
,
such
*NL*
a
beautiful
thing
,
yet
not
proud
of
itself
just
now
.
Her
breasts
swung
*NL*
slightly
in
her
blouse
.
The
arching
curve
of
her
back
was
beautiful
and
*NL*
strong
;
she
wore
no
stays
.
Suddenly
,
without
knowing
,
he
was
scattering
*NL*
a
handful
of
cowslips
over
her
hair
and
neck
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ashes
to
ashes
,
and
dust
to
dust
,
*NL*
If
the
Lord
wo
n't
have
you
the
devil
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
chill
flowers
fell
on
her
neck
.
She
looked
up
at
him
,
with
almost
*NL*
pitiful
,
scared
grey
eyes
,
wondering
what
he
was
doing
.
Flowers
fell
on
*NL*
her
face
,
and
she
shut
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
standing
there
above
her
,
he
felt
awkward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
wanted
a
funeral
,
''
he
said
,
ill
at
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
laughed
strangely
,
and
rose
,
picking
the
cowslips
from
her
hair
.
*NL*
She
took
up
her
hat
and
pinned
it
on
.
One
flower
had
remained
tangled
in
*NL*
her
hair
.
He
saw
,
but
would
not
tell
her
.
He
gathered
up
the
flowers
he
*NL*
had
sprinkled
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
edge
of
the
wood
the
bluebells
had
flowed
over
into
the
field
and
*NL*
stood
there
like
flood-water
.
But
they
were
fading
now
.
Clara
strayed
up
*NL*
to
them
.
He
wandered
after
her
.
The
bluebells
pleased
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
how
they
've
come
out
of
the
wood
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
turned
with
a
flash
of
warmth
and
of
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
blood
beat
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes
me
think
of
the
wild
men
of
the
woods
,
how
terrified
they
*NL*
would
be
when
they
got
breast
to
breast
with
the
open
space
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
they
were
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
which
was
more
frightened
among
old
tribes
--
those
bursting
out
*NL*
of
their
darkness
of
woods
upon
all
the
space
of
light
,
or
those
from
*NL*
the
open
tiptoeing
into
the
forests
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
the
second
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
DO
feel
like
one
of
the
open
space
sort
,
trying
to
force
*NL*
yourself
into
the
dark
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
know
?
''
she
answered
queerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
ended
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
was
deepening
over
the
earth
.
Already
the
valley
was
full
of
*NL*
shadow
.
One
tiny
square
of
light
stood
opposite
at
Crossleigh
Bank
Farm
.
*NL*
Brightness
was
swimming
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
.
Miriam
came
up
slowly
,
*NL*
her
face
in
her
big
,
loose
bunch
of
flowers
,
walking
ankle-deep
through
*NL*
the
scattered
froth
of
the
cowslips
.
Beyond
her
the
trees
were
coming
*NL*
into
shape
,
all
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
three
turned
away
.
They
were
all
silent
.
Going
down
the
path
*NL*
they
could
see
the
light
of
home
right
across
,
and
on
the
ridge
of
the
*NL*
hill
a
thin
dark
outline
with
little
lights
,
where
the
colliery
village
*NL*
touched
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
been
nice
,
has
n't
it
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
murmured
assent
.
Clara
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
he
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
walked
with
her
head
up
,
and
still
did
not
answer
.
He
could
tell
*NL*
by
the
way
she
moved
,
as
if
she
did
n't
care
,
that
she
suffered
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
Paul
took
his
mother
to
Lincoln
.
She
was
bright
and
*NL*
enthusiastic
as
ever
,
but
as
he
sat
opposite
her
in
the
railway
*NL*
carriage
,
she
seemed
to
look
frail
.
He
had
a
momentary
sensation
as
if
*NL*
she
were
slipping
away
from
him
.
Then
he
wanted
to
get
hold
of
her
,
to
*NL*
fasten
her
,
almost
to
chain
her
.
He
felt
he
must
keep
hold
of
her
with
*NL*
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drew
near
to
the
city
.
Both
were
at
the
window
looking
for
the
*NL*
cathedral
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
she
is
,
mother
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
the
great
cathedral
lying
couchant
above
the
plain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
So
she
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
his
mother
.
Her
blue
eyes
were
watching
the
cathedral
*NL*
quietly
.
She
seemed
again
to
be
beyond
him
.
Something
in
the
eternal
*NL*
repose
of
the
uplifted
cathedral
,
blue
and
noble
against
the
sky
,
was
*NL*
reflected
in
her
,
something
of
the
fatality
.
What
was
,
WAS
.
With
all
his
*NL*
young
will
he
could
not
alter
it
.
He
saw
her
face
,
the
skin
still
fresh
*NL*
and
pink
and
downy
,
but
crow
's
-
feet
near
her
eyes
,
her
eyelids
steady
,
*NL*
sinking
a
little
,
her
mouth
always
closed
with
disillusion
;
and
there
*NL*
was
on
her
the
same
eternal
look
,
as
if
she
knew
fate
at
last
.
He
beat
*NL*
against
it
with
all
the
strength
of
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
mother
,
how
big
she
is
above
the
town
!
Think
,
there
are
streets
*NL*
and
streets
below
her
!
She
looks
bigger
than
the
city
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
does
!
''
exclaimed
his
mother
,
breaking
bright
into
life
again
.
*NL*
But
he
had
seen
her
sitting
,
looking
steady
out
of
the
window
at
the
*NL*
cathedral
,
her
face
and
eyes
fixed
,
reflecting
the
relentlessness
of
*NL*
life
.
And
the
crow
's
-
feet
near
her
eyes
,
and
her
mouth
shut
so
hard
,
*NL*
made
him
feel
he
would
go
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
ate
a
meal
that
she
considered
wildly
extravagant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
imagine
I
like
it
,
''
she
said
,
as
she
ate
her
cutlet
.
``
I
DO
N'T
*NL*
like
it
,
I
really
do
n't
!
Just
THINK
of
your
money
wasted
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
mind
my
money
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
forget
I
'm
a
fellow
taking
his
*NL*
girl
for
an
outing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
bought
her
some
blue
violets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
it
at
once
,
sir
!
''
she
commanded
.
``
How
can
I
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
nothing
to
do
.
Stand
still
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
middle
of
High
Street
he
stuck
the
flowers
in
her
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
thing
like
me
!
''
she
said
,
sniffing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
want
people
to
think
we
're
awful
swells
.
So
look
*NL*
ikey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
jowl
your
head
,
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strut
!
''
he
commanded
.
``
Be
a
fantail
pigeon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
took
him
an
hour
to
get
her
through
the
street
.
She
stood
above
Glory
*NL*
Hole
,
she
stood
before
Stone
Bow
,
she
stood
everywhere
,
and
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
came
up
,
took
off
his
hat
,
and
bowed
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
show
you
the
town
,
madam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
've
got
my
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Paul
was
cross
with
her
for
not
answering
with
more
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
away
with
you
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Ha
!
that
's
the
Jew
's
House
.
Now
,
*NL*
do
you
remember
that
lecture
,
Paul
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
could
scarcely
climb
the
cathedral
hill
.
He
did
not
notice
.
*NL*
Then
suddenly
he
found
her
unable
to
speak
.
He
took
her
into
a
little
*NL*
public-house
,
where
she
rested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
''
she
said
.
``
My
heart
is
only
a
bit
old
;
one
must
expect
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
,
but
looked
at
her
.
Again
his
heart
was
crushed
in
a
*NL*
hot
grip
.
He
wanted
to
cry
,
he
wanted
to
smash
things
in
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
set
off
again
,
pace
by
pace
,
so
slowly
.
And
every
step
seemed
like
*NL*
a
weight
on
his
chest
.
He
felt
as
if
his
heart
would
burst
.
At
last
*NL*
they
came
to
the
top
.
She
stood
enchanted
,
looking
at
the
castle
gate
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
cathedral
front
.
She
had
quite
forgotten
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
THIS
is
better
than
I
thought
it
could
be
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
hated
it
.
Everywhere
he
followed
her
,
brooding
.
They
sat
together
*NL*
in
the
cathedral
.
They
attended
a
little
service
in
the
choir
.
She
was
*NL*
timid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it
is
open
to
anybody
?
''
she
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Do
you
think
they
'd
have
the
damned
cheek
to
send
us
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
sure
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
they
would
if
they
heard
your
*NL*
language
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
seemed
to
shine
again
with
joy
and
peace
during
the
service
.
*NL*
And
all
the
time
he
was
wanting
to
rage
and
smash
things
and
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
,
when
they
were
leaning
over
the
wall
,
looking
at
the
town
*NL*
below
,
he
blurted
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
ca
n't
a
man
have
a
YOUNG
mother
?
What
is
she
old
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
his
mother
laughed
,
``
she
can
scarcely
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
was
n't
I
the
oldest
son
?
Look
--
they
say
the
young
ones
have
the
*NL*
advantage
--
but
look
,
THEY
had
the
young
mother
.
You
should
have
had
me
*NL*
for
your
eldest
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
arrange
it
,
''
she
remonstrated
.
``
Come
to
consider
,
you
're
as
*NL*
much
to
blame
as
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
on
her
,
white
,
his
eyes
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
old
for
!
''
he
said
,
mad
with
his
impotence
.
``
WHY
ca
n't
you
*NL*
walk
?
WHY
ca
n't
you
come
with
me
to
places
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
one
time
,
''
she
replied
,
``
I
could
have
run
up
that
hill
a
good
deal
*NL*
better
than
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
good
of
that
to
ME
?
''
he
cried
,
hitting
his
fist
on
the
wall
.
*NL*
Then
he
became
plaintive
.
``
It
's
too
bad
of
you
to
be
ill
.
Little
,
it
*NL*
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ill
!
''
she
cried
.
``
I
'm
a
bit
old
,
and
you
'll
have
to
put
up
with
it
,
*NL*
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
quiet
.
But
it
was
as
much
as
they
could
bear
.
They
got
jolly
*NL*
again
over
tea
.
As
they
sat
by
Brayford
,
watching
the
boats
,
he
told
her
*NL*
about
Clara
.
His
mother
asked
him
innumerable
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
who
does
she
live
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
her
mother
,
on
Bluebell
Hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
they
enough
to
keep
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
.
I
think
they
do
lace
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
wherein
lies
her
charm
,
my
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
she
's
charming
,
mother
.
But
she
's
nice
.
And
she
seems
*NL*
straight
,
you
know
--
not
a
bit
deep
,
not
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
's
a
good
deal
older
than
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
thirty
,
I
'm
going
on
twenty-three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
told
me
what
you
like
her
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
know
--
a
sort
of
defiant
way
she
's
got
--
a
sort
of
angry
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
considered
.
She
would
have
been
glad
now
for
her
son
to
fall
*NL*
in
love
with
some
woman
who
would
--
she
did
not
know
what
.
But
he
fretted
*NL*
so
,
got
so
furious
suddenly
,
and
again
was
melancholic
.
She
wished
he
*NL*
knew
some
nice
woman
--
She
did
not
know
what
she
wished
,
but
left
it
*NL*
vague
.
At
any
rate
,
she
was
not
hostile
to
the
idea
of
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
,
too
,
was
getting
married
.
Leonard
had
gone
away
to
work
in
*NL*
Birmingham
.
One
week-end
when
he
was
home
she
had
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
look
very
well
,
my
lad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dunno
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
feel
anyhow
or
nohow
,
ma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
her
``
ma
''
already
in
his
boyish
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
they
're
good
lodgings
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
yes
.
Only
--
it
's
a
winder
when
you
have
to
pour
your
own
tea
*NL*
out
--
an
'
nobody
to
grouse
if
you
team
it
in
your
saucer
and
sup
it
up
.
*NL*
It
somehow
takes
a
'
the
taste
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
it
knocks
you
up
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dunno
.
I
want
to
get
married
,
''
he
blurted
,
twisting
his
fingers
and
*NL*
looking
down
at
his
boots
.
There
was
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
I
thought
you
said
you
'd
wait
another
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
say
so
,
''
he
replied
stubbornly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
considered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
,
''
she
said
,
``
Annie
's
a
bit
of
a
spendthrift
.
She
's
saved
*NL*
no
more
than
eleven
pounds
.
And
I
know
,
lad
,
you
have
n't
had
much
*NL*
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
coloured
up
to
the
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
thirty-three
quid
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
go
far
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
nothing
,
but
twisted
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
've
nothing
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
want
,
ma
!
''
he
cried
,
very
red
,
suffering
and
remonstrating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
lad
,
I
know
.
I
was
only
wishing
I
had
.
And
take
away
five
pounds
*NL*
for
the
wedding
and
things
--
it
leaves
twenty-nine
pounds
.
You
wo
n't
do
*NL*
much
on
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
twisted
still
,
impotent
,
stubborn
,
not
looking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
you
really
want
to
get
married
?
''
she
asked
.
``
Do
you
feel
as
if
*NL*
you
ought
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
one
straight
look
from
his
blue
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
she
replied
,
``
we
must
all
do
the
best
we
can
for
it
,
lad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
time
he
looked
up
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
Annie
to
feel
handicapped
,
''
he
said
,
struggling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lad
,
''
she
said
,
``
you
're
steady
--
you
've
got
a
decent
place
.
If
a
man
*NL*
had
NEEDED
me
I
'd
have
married
him
on
his
last
week
's
wages
.
She
may
*NL*
find
it
a
bit
hard
to
start
humbly
.
Young
girls
ARE
like
that
.
They
look
*NL*
forward
to
the
fine
home
they
think
they
'll
have
.
But
I
had
expensive
*NL*
furniture
.
It
's
not
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
wedding
took
place
almost
immediately
.
Arthur
came
home
,
and
was
*NL*
splendid
in
uniform
.
Annie
looked
nice
in
a
dove-grey
dress
that
she
*NL*
could
take
for
Sundays
.
Morel
called
her
a
fool
for
getting
married
,
and
*NL*
was
cool
with
his
son-in-law
.
Mrs.
Morel
had
white
tips
in
her
bonnet
,
*NL*
and
some
white
on
her
blouse
,
and
was
teased
by
both
her
sons
for
*NL*
fancying
herself
so
grand
.
Leonard
was
jolly
and
cordial
,
and
felt
a
*NL*
fearful
fool
.
Paul
could
not
quite
see
what
Annie
wanted
to
get
*NL*
married
for
.
He
was
fond
of
her
,
and
she
of
him
.
Still
,
he
hoped
rather
*NL*
lugubriously
that
it
would
turn
out
all
right
.
Arthur
was
astonishingly
*NL*
handsome
in
his
scarlet
and
yellow
,
and
he
knew
it
well
,
but
was
*NL*
secretly
ashamed
of
the
uniform
.
Annie
cried
her
eyes
up
in
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
on
leaving
her
mother
.
Mrs.
Morel
cried
a
little
,
then
patted
her
on
the
*NL*
back
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
n't
cry
,
child
,
he
'll
be
good
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
stamped
and
said
she
was
a
fool
to
go
and
tie
herself
up
.
Leonard
*NL*
looked
white
and
overwrought
.
Mrs.
Morel
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
trust
her
to
you
,
my
lad
,
and
hold
you
responsible
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
,
''
he
said
,
nearly
dead
with
the
ordeal
.
And
it
was
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Morel
and
Arthur
were
in
bed
,
Paul
sat
talking
,
as
he
often
did
,
*NL*
with
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
sorry
she
's
married
,
mother
,
are
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sorry
she
's
married
--
but
--
it
seems
strange
that
she
should
go
*NL*
from
me
.
It
even
seems
to
me
hard
that
she
can
prefer
to
go
with
her
*NL*
Leonard
.
That
's
how
mothers
are
--
I
know
it
's
silly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
shall
you
be
miserable
about
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
think
of
my
own
wedding
day
,
''
his
mother
answered
,
``
I
can
only
*NL*
hope
her
life
will
be
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
can
trust
him
to
be
good
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
.
They
say
he
's
not
good
enough
for
her
.
But
I
say
if
a
man
*NL*
is
GENUINE
,
as
he
is
,
and
a
girl
is
fond
of
him
--
then
--
it
should
be
all
*NL*
right
.
He
's
as
good
as
she
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
do
n't
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
NEVER
have
let
a
daughter
of
mine
marry
a
man
I
did
n't
FEEL
to
*NL*
be
genuine
through
and
through
.
And
yet
,
there
's
a
gap
now
she
's
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
miserable
,
and
wanted
her
back
again
.
It
seemed
to
Paul
*NL*
his
mother
looked
lonely
,
in
her
new
black
silk
blouse
with
its
bit
of
*NL*
white
trimming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
mother
,
I
s
'll
never
marry
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

all
say
that

my
lad

not
met

*NL*
``
Ay

's

``

nearly
twenty-three

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
should
n't
like
to
leave
you
with
nobody

my

she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
going
to
leave
me

What
are
you

Fifty-three

I
'll
give

you

seventy-five

There
you

fat
and
forty-four

Then
I
'll
*NL*
marry
a
staid
body

See
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
sat
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
bed
,
''
she
said
--
``
go
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
we
'll
have
a
pretty
house
,
you
and
me

and
a
servant

and
it
'll
be

just
all
right

rich

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
go
to
bed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
you
s
'll
have
a
pony-carriage

See
yourself

a
little
Queen
*NL*
Victoria
trotting
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
to
go
to
bed
,
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
and
went
.
His
plans
for
the
future
were
always
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
sat
brooding
--
about
her
daughter
,
about
Paul
,
about
Arthur
.
*NL*
She
fretted
at
losing
Annie
.
The
family
was
very
closely
bound
.
And
she
*NL*
felt
she
MUST
live
now
,
to
be
with
her
children
.
Life
was
so
rich
for
*NL*
her
.
Paul
wanted
her
,
and
so
did
Arthur
.
Arthur
never
knew
how
deeply
he
*NL*
loved
her
.
He
was
a
creature
of
the
moment
.
Never
yet
had
he
been
forced
*NL*
to
realise
himself
.
The
army
had
disciplined
his
body
,
but
not
his
soul
.
*NL*
He
was
in
perfect
health
and
very
handsome
.
His
dark
,
vigorous
hair
sat
*NL*
close
to
his
smallish
head
.
There
was
something
childish
about
his
nose
,
*NL*
something
almost
girlish
about
his
dark
blue
eyes
.
But
he
had
the
fun
*NL*
red
mouth
of
a
man
under
his
brown
moustache
,
and
his
jaw
was
strong
.
*NL*
It
was
his
father
's
mouth
;
it
was
the
nose
and
eyes
of
her
own
mother
's
*NL*
people
--
good-looking
,
weak-principled
folk
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
anxious
about
*NL*
him
.
Once
he
had
really
run
the
rig
he
was
safe
.
But
how
far
would
he
*NL*
go
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
army
had
not
really
done
him
any
good
.
He
resented
bitterly
the
*NL*
authority
of
the
officers
.
He
hated
having
to
obey
as
if
he
were
an
*NL*
animal
.
But
he
had
too
much
sense
to
kick
.
So
he
turned
his
attention
*NL*
to
getting
the
best
out
of
it
.
He
could
sing
,
he
was
a
boon-companion
.
*NL*
Often
he
got
into
scrapes
,
but
they
were
the
manly
scrapes
that
*NL*
are
easily
condoned
.
So
he
made
a
good
time
out
of
it
,
whilst
his
*NL*
self-respect
was
in
suppression
.
He
trusted
to
his
good
looks
and
*NL*
handsome
figure
,
his
refinement
,
his
decent
education
to
get
him
most
*NL*
of
what
he
wanted
,
and
he
was
not
disappointed
.
Yet
he
was
restless
.
*NL*
Something
seemed
to
gnaw
him
inside
.
He
was
never
still
,
he
was
never
*NL*
alone
.
With
his
mother
he
was
rather
humble
.
Paul
he
admired
and
loved
*NL*
and
despised
slightly
.
And
Paul
admired
and
loved
and
despised
him
*NL*
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
had
had
a
few
pounds
left
to
her
by
her
father
,
and
she
*NL*
decided
to
buy
her
son
out
of
the
army
.
He
was
wild
with
joy
.
Now
he
was
*NL*
like
a
lad
taking
a
holiday
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
always
been
fond
of
Beatrice
Wyld
,
and
during
his
furlough
he
*NL*
picked
up
with
her
again
.
She
was
stronger
and
better
in
health
.
The
*NL*
two
often
went
long
walks
together
,
Arthur
taking
her
arm
in
soldier
's
*NL*
fashion
,
rather
stiffly
.
And
she
came
to
play
the
piano
whilst
he
sang
.
*NL*
Then
Arthur
would
unhook
his
tunic
collar
.
He
grew
flushed
,
his
eyes
*NL*
were
bright
,
he
sang
in
a
manly
tenor
.
Afterwards
they
sat
together
on
*NL*
the
sofa
.
He
seemed
to
flaunt
his
body
:
she
was
aware
of
him
so
--
the
*NL*
strong
chest
,
the
sides
,
the
thighs
in
their
close-fitting
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
liked
to
lapse
into
the
dialect
when
he
talked
to
her
.
She
would
*NL*
sometimes
smoke
with
him
.
Occasionally
she
would
only
take
a
few
whiffs
*NL*
at
his
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
he
said
to
her
one
evening
,
when
she
reached
for
his
cigarette
.
*NL*
``
Nay
,
tha
doesna
.
I
'll
gi'e
thee
a
smoke
kiss
if
ter
's
a
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
a
whiff
,
no
kiss
at
all
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
an
'
tha
s
`
lt
ha'e
a
whiff
,
''
he
said
,
``
along
wi
'
t
'
kiss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
a
draw
at
thy
fag
,
''
she
cried
,
snatching
for
the
cigarette
*NL*
between
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
sitting
with
his
shoulder
touching
her
.
She
was
small
and
quick
*NL*
as
lightning
.
He
just
escaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
gi'e
thee
a
smoke
kiss
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
`
rt
a
knivey
nuisance
,
Arty
Morel
,
''
she
said
,
sitting
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha'e
a
smoke
kiss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
leaned
forward
to
her
,
smiling
.
His
face
was
near
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shonna
!
''
she
replied
,
turning
away
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
draw
at
his
cigarette
,
and
pursed
up
his
mouth
,
and
put
his
*NL*
lips
close
to
her
.
His
dark-brown
cropped
moustache
stood
out
like
a
*NL*
brush
.
She
looked
at
the
puckered
crimson
lips
,
then
suddenly
snatched
*NL*
the
cigarette
from
his
fingers
and
darted
away
.
He
,
leaping
after
her
,
*NL*
seized
the
comb
from
her
back
hair
.
She
turned
,
threw
the
cigarette
at
*NL*
him
.
He
picked
it
up
,
put
it
in
his
mouth
,
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nuisance
!
''
she
cried
.
``
Give
me
my
comb
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
afraid
that
her
hair
,
specially
done
for
him
,
would
come
down
.
*NL*
She
stood
with
her
hands
to
her
head
.
He
hid
the
comb
between
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
non
got
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cigarette
trembled
between
his
lips
with
laughter
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Liar
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'S
true
as
I
'm
here
!
''
he
laughed
,
showing
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
brazen
imp
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
rushing
and
scuffling
for
the
comb
,
*NL*
which
he
had
under
his
knees
.
As
she
wrestled
with
him
,
pulling
at
his
*NL*
smooth
,
tight-covered
knees
,
he
laughed
till
he
lay
back
on
the
sofa
*NL*
shaking
with
laughter
.
The
cigarette
fell
from
his
mouth
almost
singeing
*NL*
his
throat
.
Under
his
delicate
tan
the
blood
flushed
up
,
and
he
laughed
*NL*
till
his
blue
eyes
were
blinded
,
his
throat
swollen
almost
to
choking
.
*NL*
Then
he
sat
up
.
Beatrice
was
putting
in
her
comb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tha
tickled
me
,
Beat
,
''
he
said
thickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
a
flash
her
small
white
hand
went
out
and
smacked
his
face
.
He
*NL*
started
up
,
glaring
at
her
.
They
stared
at
each
other
.
Slowly
the
flush
*NL*
mounted
her
cheek
,
she
dropped
her
eyes
,
then
her
head
.
He
sat
down
*NL*
sulkily
.
She
went
into
the
scullery
to
adjust
her
hair
.
In
private
there
*NL*
she
shed
a
few
tears
,
she
did
not
know
what
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
returned
she
was
pursed
up
close
.
But
it
was
only
a
film
over
*NL*
her
fire
.
He
,
with
ruffled
hair
,
was
sulking
upon
the
sofa
.
She
sat
down
*NL*
opposite
,
in
the
armchair
,
and
neither
spoke
.
The
clock
ticked
in
the
*NL*
silence
like
blows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
little
cat
,
Beat
,
''
he
said
at
length
,
half
apologetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
should
n't
be
brazen
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
again
a
long
silence
.
He
whistled
to
himself
like
a
man
much
*NL*
agitated
but
defiant
.
Suddenly
she
went
across
to
him
and
kissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
it
,
pore
fing
!
''
she
mocked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
his
face
,
smiling
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kiss
?
''
he
invited
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dare
n't
I
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
!
''
he
challenged
,
his
mouth
lifted
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Deliberately
,
and
with
a
peculiar
quivering
smile
that
seemed
to
*NL*
overspread
her
whole
body
,
she
put
her
mouth
on
his
.
Immediately
his
*NL*
arms
folded
round
her
.
As
soon
as
the
long
kiss
was
finished
she
drew
*NL*
back
her
head
from
him
,
put
her
delicate
fingers
on
his
neck
,
through
*NL*
the
open
collar
.
Then
she
closed
her
eyes
,
giving
herself
up
again
in
a
*NL*
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
acted
of
her
own
free
will
.
What
she
would
do
she
did
,
and
made
*NL*
nobody
responsible
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
felt
life
changing
around
him
.
The
conditions
of
youth
were
gone
.
*NL*
Now
it
was
a
home
of
grown-up
people
.
Annie
was
a
married
woman
,
Arthur
*NL*
was
following
his
own
pleasure
in
a
way
unknown
to
his
folk
.
For
so
long
*NL*
they
had
all
lived
at
home
,
and
gone
out
to
pass
their
time
.
But
now
,
*NL*
for
Annie
and
Arthur
,
life
lay
outside
their
mother
's
house
.
They
came
*NL*
home
for
holiday
and
for
rest
.
So
there
was
that
strange
,
half-empty
*NL*
feeling
about
the
house
,
as
if
the
birds
had
flown
.
Paul
became
more
and
*NL*
more
unsettled
.
Annie
and
Arthur
had
gone
.
He
was
restless
to
follow
.
*NL*
Yet
home
was
for
him
beside
his
mother
.
And
still
there
was
something
*NL*
else
,
something
outside
,
something
he
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
grew
more
and
more
restless
.
Miriam
did
not
satisfy
him
.
His
old
mad
*NL*
desire
to
be
with
her
grew
weaker
.
Sometimes
he
met
Clara
in
Nottingham
,
*NL*
sometimes
he
went
to
meetings
with
her
,
sometimes
he
saw
her
at
Willey
*NL*
Farm
.
But
on
these
last
occasions
the
situation
became
strained
.
There
*NL*
was
a
triangle
of
antagonism
between
Paul
and
Clara
and
Miriam
.
With
*NL*
Clara
he
took
on
a
smart
,
worldly
,
mocking
tone
very
antagonistic
to
*NL*
Miriam
.
It
did
not
matter
what
went
before
.
She
might
be
intimate
and
*NL*
sad
with
him
.
Then
as
soon
as
Clara
appeared
,
it
all
vanished
,
and
he
*NL*
played
to
the
newcomer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
had
one
beautiful
evening
with
him
in
the
hay
.
He
had
been
on
*NL*
the
horse-rake
,
and
having
finished
,
came
to
help
her
to
put
the
hay
in
*NL*
cocks
.
Then
he
talked
to
her
of
his
hopes
and
despairs
,
and
his
whole
*NL*
soul
seemed
to
lie
bare
before
her
.
She
felt
as
if
she
watched
the
very
*NL*
quivering
stuff
of
life
in
him
.
The
moon
came
out
:
they
walked
home
*NL*
together
:
he
seemed
to
have
come
to
her
because
he
needed
her
so
badly
,
*NL*
and
she
listened
to
him
,
gave
him
all
her
love
and
her
faith
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
her
he
brought
her
the
best
of
himself
to
keep
,
and
that
she
would
*NL*
guard
it
all
her
life
.
Nay
,
the
sky
did
not
cherish
the
stars
more
*NL*
surely
and
eternally
than
she
would
guard
the
good
in
the
soul
of
Paul
*NL*
Morel
.
She
went
on
home
alone
,
feeling
exalted
,
glad
in
her
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
the
next
day
,
Clara
came
.
They
were
to
have
tea
in
the
*NL*
hayfield
.
Miriam
watched
the
evening
drawing
to
gold
and
shadow
.
And
all
*NL*
the
time
Paul
was
sporting
with
Clara
.
He
made
higher
and
higher
heaps
*NL*
of
hay
that
they
were
jumping
over
.
Miriam
did
not
care
for
the
game
,
*NL*
and
stood
aside
.
Edgar
and
Geoffrey
and
Maurice
and
Clara
and
Paul
*NL*
jumped
.
Paul
won
,
because
he
was
light
.
Clara
's
blood
was
roused
.
She
*NL*
could
run
like
an
Amazon
.
Paul
loved
the
determined
way
she
rushed
at
*NL*
the
hay-cock
and
leaped
,
landed
on
the
other
side
,
her
breasts
shaken
,
*NL*
her
thick
hair
come
undone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
touched
!
''
he
cried
.
``
You
touched
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
she
flashed
,
turning
to
Edgar
.
``
I
did
n't
touch
,
did
I
?
Was
n't
I
*NL*
clear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
say
,
''
laughed
Edgar
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
them
could
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
touched
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
You
're
beaten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
NOT
touch
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
plain
as
anything
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Box
his
ears
for
me
!
''
she
cried
to
Edgar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
Edgar
laughed
.
``
I
dare
n't
.
You
must
do
it
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
nothing
can
alter
the
fact
that
you
touched
,
''
laughed
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
furious
with
him
.
Her
little
triumph
before
these
lads
and
men
*NL*
was
gone
.
She
had
forgotten
herself
in
the
game
.
Now
he
was
to
humble
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
despicable
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
he
laughed
,
in
a
way
that
tortured
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
KNEW
you
could
n't
jump
that
heap
,
''
he
teased
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
back
on
him
.
Yet
everybody
could
see
that
the
only
person
*NL*
she
listened
to
,
or
was
conscious
of
,
was
he
,
and
he
of
her
.
It
pleased
*NL*
the
men
to
see
this
battle
between
them
.
But
Miriam
was
tortured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
could
choose
the
lesser
in
place
of
the
higher
,
she
saw
.
He
could
*NL*
be
unfaithful
to
himself
,
unfaithful
to
the
real
,
deep
Paul
Morel
.
*NL*
There
was
a
danger
of
his
becoming
frivolous
,
of
his
running
after
his
*NL*
satisfaction
like
any
Arthur
,
or
like
his
father
.
It
made
Miriam
bitter
*NL*
to
think
that
he
should
throw
away
his
soul
for
this
flippant
traffic
of
*NL*
triviality
with
Clara
.
She
walked
in
bitterness
and
silence
,
while
the
*NL*
other
two
rallied
each
other
,
and
Paul
sported
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
afterwards
,
he
would
not
own
it
,
but
he
was
rather
ashamed
of
*NL*
himself
,
and
prostrated
himself
before
Miriam
.
Then
again
he
rebelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
religious
to
be
religious
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
reckon
a
crow
is
*NL*
religious
when
it
sails
across
the
sky
.
But
it
only
does
it
because
it
*NL*
feels
itself
carried
to
where
it
's
going
,
not
because
it
thinks
it
is
*NL*
being
eternal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Miriam
knew
that
one
should
be
religious
in
everything
,
have
God
,
*NL*
whatever
God
might
be
,
present
in
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
God
knows
such
a
lot
about
Himself
,
''
he
cried
.
``
God
*NL*
does
n't
KNOW
things
,
He
IS
things
.
And
I
'm
sure
He
's
not
soulful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
Paul
was
arguing
God
on
to
his
own
side
,
*NL*
because
he
wanted
his
own
way
and
his
own
pleasure
.
There
was
a
long
*NL*
battle
between
him
and
her
.
He
was
utterly
unfaithful
to
her
even
in
her
*NL*
own
presence
;
then
he
was
ashamed
,
then
repentant
;
then
he
hated
her
,
*NL*
and
went
off
again
.
Those
were
the
ever-recurring
conditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fretted
him
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
.
There
she
remained
--
sad
,
*NL*
pensive
,
a
worshipper
.
And
he
caused
her
sorrow
.
Half
the
time
he
*NL*
grieved
for
her
,
half
the
time
he
hated
her
.
She
was
his
conscience
;
and
*NL*
he
felt
,
somehow
,
he
had
got
a
conscience
that
was
too
much
for
him
.
He
*NL*
could
not
leave
her
,
because
in
one
way
she
did
hold
the
best
of
him
.
He
*NL*
could
not
stay
with
her
because
she
did
not
take
the
rest
of
him
,
which
*NL*
was
three-quarters
.
So
he
chafed
himself
into
rawness
over
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
twenty-one
he
wrote
her
a
letter
which
could
only
have
been
*NL*
written
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
speak
of
our
old
,
worn
love
,
this
last
time
.
It
,
too
,
is
*NL*
changing
,
is
it
not
?
Say
,
has
not
the
body
of
that
love
died
,
and
left
*NL*
you
its
invulnerable
soul
?
You
see
,
I
can
give
you
a
spirit
love
,
I
have
*NL*
given
it
you
this
long
,
long
time
;
but
not
embodied
passion
.
See
,
you
*NL*
are
a
nun
.
I
have
given
you
what
I
would
give
a
holy
nun
--
as
a
mystic
*NL*
monk
to
a
mystic
nun
.
Surely
you
esteem
it
best
.
Yet
you
regret
--
no
,
*NL*
have
regretted
--
the
other
.
In
all
our
relations
no
body
enters
.
I
do
not
*NL*
talk
to
you
through
the
senses
--
rather
through
the
spirit
.
That
is
why
*NL*
we
can
not
love
in
the
common
sense
.
Ours
is
not
an
everyday
affection
.
*NL*
As
yet
we
are
mortal
,
and
to
live
side
by
side
with
one
another
would
be
*NL*
dreadful
,
for
somehow
with
you
I
can
not
long
be
trivial
,
and
,
you
know
,
*NL*
to
be
always
beyond
this
mortal
state
would
be
to
lose
it
.
If
people
*NL*
marry
,
they
must
live
together
as
affectionate
humans
,
who
may
be
*NL*
commonplace
with
each
other
without
feeling
awkward
--
not
as
two
souls
.
*NL*
So
I
feel
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ought
I
to
send
this
letter
?
--
I
doubt
it
.
But
there
--
it
is
best
to
*NL*
understand
.
Au
revoir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
read
this
letter
twice
,
after
which
she
sealed
it
up
.
A
year
*NL*
later
she
broke
the
seal
to
show
her
mother
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
nun
--
you
are
a
nun
.
''
The
words
went
into
her
heart
again
and
*NL*
again
.
Nothing
he
ever
had
said
had
gone
into
her
so
deeply
,
fixedly
,
*NL*
like
a
mortal
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
him
two
days
after
the
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Our
intimacy
would
have
been
all-beautiful
but
for
one
little
*NL*
mistake
,
'
''
she
quoted
.
``
Was
the
mistake
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
immediately
he
replied
to
her
from
Nottingham
,
sending
her
at
the
*NL*
same
time
a
little
``
Omar
Khayyam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
answered
;
you
are
so
calm
and
natural
you
put
me
*NL*
to
shame
.
What
a
ranter
I
am
!
We
are
often
out
of
sympathy
.
But
in
*NL*
fundamentals
we
may
always
be
together
I
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
thank
you
for
your
sympathy
with
my
painting
and
drawing

Many
a

sketch
is
dedicated

I
do
look
forward
to
your
criticisms
,
which

*NL*
to
my
shame

are
always
grand
appreciations

It
is
a
lovely
*NL*
joke
,
that

Au

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
end
of
the
first
phase
of
Paul
's
love
affair
.
He
was
now
*NL*
about
twenty-three
years
old
,
and
,
though
still
virgin
,
the
sex
instinct
*NL*
that
Miriam
had
over-refined
for
so
long
now
grew
particularly
strong
.
*NL*
Often
,
as
he
talked
to
Clara
Dawes
,
came
that
thickening
and
quickening
*NL*
of
his
blood
,
that
peculiar
concentration
in
the
breast
,
as
if
something
*NL*
were
alive
there
,
a
new
self
or
a
new
centre
of
consciousness
,
warning
*NL*
him
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
ask
one
woman
or
another
.
But
*NL*
he
belonged
to
Miriam
.
Of
that
she
was
so
fixedly
sure
that
he
allowed
*NL*
her
right
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
CLARA
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
he
was
twenty-three
years
old
,
Paul
sent
in
a
landscape
to
the
*NL*
winter
exhibition
at
Nottingham
Castle
.
Miss
Jordan
had
taken
a
good
*NL*
deal
of
interest
in
him
,
and
invited
him
to
her
house
,
where
he
met
*NL*
other
artists
.
He
was
beginning
to
grow
ambitious
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
the
postman
came
just
as
he
was
washing
in
the
scullery
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
heard
a
wild
noise
from
his
mother
.
Rushing
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
he
found
her
standing
on
the
hearthrug
wildly
waving
a
*NL*
letter
and
crying
``
Hurrah
!
''
as
if
she
had
gone
mad
.
He
was
shocked
and
*NL*
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
mother
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flew
to
him
,
flung
her
arms
round
him
for
a
moment
,
then
waved
the
*NL*
letter
,
crying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
,
my
boy
!
I
knew
we
should
do
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
afraid
of
her
--
the
small
,
severe
woman
with
graying
hair
suddenly
*NL*
bursting
out
in
such
frenzy
.
The
postman
came
running
back
,
afraid
*NL*
something
had
happened
.
They
saw
his
tipped
cap
over
the
short
curtains
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
rushed
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
picture
's
got
first
prize
,
Fred
,
''
she
cried
,
``
and
is
sold
for
*NL*
twenty
guineas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
word
,
that
's
something
like
!
''
said
the
young
postman
,
whom
they
had
*NL*
known
all
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Major
Moreton
has
bought
it
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
like
meanin
'
something
,
that
does
,
Mrs.
Morel
,
''
said
the
*NL*
postman
,
his
blue
eyes
bright
.
He
was
glad
to
have
brought
such
a
lucky
*NL*
letter
.
Mrs.
Morel
went
indoors
and
sat
down
,
trembling
.
Paul
was
afraid
*NL*
lest
she
might
have
misread
the
letter
,
and
might
be
disappointed
after
*NL*
all
.
He
scrutinised
it
once
,
twice
.
Yes
,
he
became
convinced
it
was
*NL*
true
.
Then
he
sat
down
,
his
heart
beating
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
SAY
we
should
do
it
!
''
she
said
,
pretending
she
was
not
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
kettle
off
the
fire
and
mashed
the
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
think
,
mother
--
''
he
began
tentatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
son
--
not
so
much
--
but
I
expected
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
so
much
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no
--
but
I
knew
we
should
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
recovered
her
composure
,
apparently
at
least
.
He
sat
with
*NL*
his
shirt
turned
back
,
showing
his
young
throat
almost
like
a
girl
's
,
*NL*
and
the
towel
in
his
hand
,
his
hair
sticking
up
wet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
guineas
,
mother
!
That
's
just
what
you
wanted
to
buy
Arthur
out
.
*NL*
Now
you
need
n't
borrow
any
.
It
'll
just
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
sha
n't
take
it
all
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
sha
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
you
have
twelve
pounds
,
I
'll
have
nine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
cavilled
about
sharing
the
twenty
guineas
.
She
wanted
to
take
only
*NL*
the
five
pounds
she
needed
.
He
would
not
hear
of
it
.
So
they
got
over
*NL*
the
stress
of
emotion
by
quarrelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
came
home
at
night
from
the
pit
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
tell
me
Paul
's
got
first
prize
for
his
picture
,
and
sold
it
to
*NL*
Lord
Henry
Bentley
for
fifty
pound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
stories
people
do
tell
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
he
answered
.
``
I
said
I
wor
sure
it
wor
a
lie
.
But
they
said
tha
'd
*NL*
told
Fred
Hodgkisson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
I
would
tell
him
such
stuff
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
assented
the
miner
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
disappointed
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
true
he
has
got
the
first
prize
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
miner
sat
heavily
in
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
,
beguy
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stared
across
the
room
fixedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
for
fifty
pounds
--
such
nonsense
!
''
She
was
silent
awhile
.
``
Major
*NL*
Moreton
bought
it
for
twenty
guineas
,
that
's
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
guineas
!
Tha
niver
says
!
''
exclaimed
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
it
was
worth
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
misdoubt
it
.
But
twenty
guineas
for
a
bit
of
a
*NL*
paintin
'
as
he
knocked
off
in
an
hour
or
two
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
with
conceit
of
his
son
.
Mrs.
Morel
sniffed
,
as
if
it
were
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
does
he
handle
th
'
money
?
''
asked
the
collier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
could
n't
tell
you
.
When
the
picture
is
sent
home
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
.
Morel
stared
at
the
sugar-basin
instead
of
eating
his
*NL*
dinner
.
His
black
arm
,
with
the
hand
all
gnarled
with
work
lay
on
the
*NL*
table
.
His
wife
pretended
not
to
see
him
rub
the
back
of
his
hand
across
*NL*
his
eyes
,
nor
the
smear
in
the
coal-dust
on
his
black
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
an
'
that
other
lad
`
ud
'
a
done
as
much
if
they
hadna
ha
'
killed
*NL*
`
im
,
''
he
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thought
of
William
went
through
Mrs.
Morel
like
a
cold
blade
.
It
*NL*
left
her
feeling
she
was
tired
,
and
wanted
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
invited
to
dinner
at
Mr.
Jordan
's
.
Afterwards
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
I
want
an
evening
suit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
was
afraid
you
would
,
''
she
said
.
She
was
glad
.
There
was
*NL*
a
moment
or
two
of
silence
.
``
There
's
that
one
of
William
's
,
''
she
*NL*
continued
,
``
that
I
know
cost
four
pounds
ten
and
which
he
'd
only
worn
*NL*
three
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
you
like
me
to
wear
it
,
mother
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
think
it
would
fit
you
--
at
least
the
coat
.
The
trousers
would
*NL*
want
shortening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
upstairs
and
put
on
the
coat
and
vest
.
Coming
down
,
he
looked
*NL*
strange
in
a
flannel
collar
and
a
flannel
shirt-front
,
with
an
evening
*NL*
coat
and
vest
.
It
was
rather
large
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tailor
can
make
it
right
,
''
she
said
,
smoothing
her
hand
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
``
It
's
beautiful
stuff
.
I
never
could
find
in
my
heart
to
let
*NL*
your
father
wear
the
trousers
,
and
very
glad
I
am
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
she
smoothed
her
hand
over
the
silk
collar
she
thought
of
her
*NL*
eldest
son
.
But
this
son
was
living
enough
inside
the
clothes
.
She
*NL*
passed
her
hand
down
his
back
to
feel
him
.
He
was
alive
and
hers
.
The
*NL*
other
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
to
dinner
several
times
in
his
evening
suit
that
had
been
*NL*
William
's
.
Each
time
his
mother
's
heart
was
firm
with
pride
and
joy
.
He
*NL*
was
started
now
.
The
studs
she
and
the
children
had
bought
for
William
*NL*
were
in
his
shirt-front
;
he
wore
one
of
William
's
dress
shirts
.
But
he
*NL*
had
an
elegant
figure
.
His
face
was
rough
,
but
warm-looking
and
rather
*NL*
pleasing
.
He
did
not
look
particularly
a
gentleman
,
but
she
thought
he
*NL*
looked
quite
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
her
everything
that
took
place
,
everything
that
was
said
.
It
was
*NL*
as
if
she
had
been
there
.
And
he
was
dying
to
introduce
her
to
these
new
*NL*
friends
who
had
dinner
at
seven-thirty
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
with
you
!
''
she
said
.
``
What
do
they
want
to
know
me
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
!
''
he
cried
indignantly
.
``
If
they
want
to
know
me
--
and
they
say
*NL*
they
do
--
then
they
want
to
know
you
,
because
you
are
quite
as
clever
as
*NL*
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
with
you
,
child
!
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
began
to
spare
her
hands
.
They
,
too
,
were
work-gnarled
now
.
The
*NL*
skin
was
shiny
with
so
much
hot
water
,
the
knuckles
rather
swollen
.
But
*NL*
she
began
to
be
careful
to
keep
them
out
of
soda
.
She
regretted
what
*NL*
they
had
been
--
so
small
and
exquisite
.
And
when
Annie
insisted
on
her
*NL*
having
more
stylish
blouses
to
suit
her
age
,
she
submitted
.
She
even
*NL*
went
so
far
as
to
allow
a
black
velvet
bow
to
be
placed
on
her
hair
.
*NL*
Then
she
sniffed
in
her
sarcastic
manner
,
and
was
sure
she
looked
a
*NL*
sight
.
But
she
looked
a
lady
,
Paul
declared
,
as
much
as
Mrs.
Major
*NL*
Moreton
,
and
far
,
far
nicer
.
The
family
was
coming
on
.
Only
Morel
*NL*
remained
unchanged
,
or
rather
,
lapsed
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
and
his
mother
now
had
long
discussions
about
life
.
Religion
was
*NL*
fading
into
the
background
.
He
had
shovelled
away
all
the
beliefs
that
*NL*
would
hamper
him
,
had
cleared
the
ground
,
and
come
more
or
less
to
the
*NL*
bedrock
of
belief
that
one
should
feel
inside
oneself
for
right
and
*NL*
wrong
,
and
should
have
the
patience
to
gradually
realise
one
's
God
.
Now
*NL*
life
interested
him
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
he
said
to
his
mother
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
belong
to
the
*NL*
well-to-do
middle
class
.
I
like
my
common
people
best
.
I
belong
to
the
*NL*
common
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
anyone
else
said
so
,
my
son
,
would
n't
you
be
in
a
tear
.
YOU
know
*NL*
you
consider
yourself
equal
to
any
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
myself
,
''
he
answered
,
``
not
in
my
class
or
my
education
or
my
*NL*
manners
.
But
in
myself
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
.
Then
why
talk
about
the
common
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
--
the
difference
between
people
is
n't
in
their
class
,
but
in
*NL*
themselves
.
Only
from
the
middle
classes
one
gets
ideas
,
and
from
the
*NL*
common
people
--
life
itself
,
warmth
.
You
feel
their
hates
and
loves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
very
well
,
my
boy
.
But
,
then
,
why
do
n't
you
go
and
talk
to
*NL*
your
father
's
pals
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
're
rather
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
.
They
're
the
common
people
.
After
all
,
whom
do
you
mix
with
*NL*
now
--
among
the
common
people
?
Those
that
exchange
ideas
,
like
the
middle
*NL*
classes
.
The
rest
do
n't
interest
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
there
's
the
life
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
there
's
a
jot
more
life
from
Miriam
than
you
could
get
*NL*
from
any
educated
girl
--
say
Miss
Moreton
.
It
is
YOU
who
are
snobbish
*NL*
about
class
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
frankly
WANTED
him
to
climb
into
the
middle
classes
,
a
thing
not
*NL*
very
difficult
,
she
knew
.
And
she
wanted
him
in
the
end
to
marry
a
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
began
to
combat
him
in
his
restless
fretting
.
He
still
kept
up
*NL*
his
connection
with
Miriam
,
could
neither
break
free
nor
go
the
whole
*NL*
length
of
engagement
.
And
this
indecision
seemed
to
bleed
him
of
his
*NL*
energy
.
Moreover
,
his
mother
suspected
him
of
an
unrecognised
leaning
*NL*
towards
Clara
,
and
,
since
the
latter
was
a
married
woman
,
she
wished
he
*NL*
would
fall
in
love
with
one
of
the
girls
in
a
better
station
of
life
.
*NL*
But
he
was
stupid
,
and
would
refuse
to
love
or
even
to
admire
a
girl
*NL*
much
,
just
because
she
was
his
social
superior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
boy
,
''
said
his
mother
to
him
,
``
all
your
cleverness
,
your
breaking
*NL*
away
from
old
things
,
and
taking
life
in
your
own
hands
,
does
n't
seem
to
*NL*
bring
you
much
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
happiness
!
''
he
cried
.
``
It
's
nothing
to
me
!
How
AM
I
to
be
*NL*
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
plump
question
disturbed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
for
you
to
judge
,
my
lad
.
But
if
you
could
meet
some
GOOD
*NL*
woman
who
would
MAKE
you
happy
--
and
you
began
to
think
of
settling
your
*NL*
life
--
when
you
have
the
means
--
so
that
you
could
work
without
all
this
*NL*
fretting
--
it
would
be
much
better
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
.
His
mother
caught
him
on
the
raw
of
his
wound
of
Miriam
.
*NL*
He
pushed
the
tumbled
hair
off
his
forehead
,
his
eyes
full
of
pain
and
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
easy
,
mother
,
''
he
cried
.
``
That
's
a
woman
's
whole
doctrine
for
*NL*
life
--
ease
of
soul
and
physical
comfort
.
And
I
do
despise
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
!
''
replied
his
mother
.
``
And
do
you
call
yours
a
divine
*NL*
discontent

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
do
n't
care
about
its
divinity

But
damn
your
happiness

So
long
*NL*
as
life
's
full
,
it
does
n't
matter
whether
it
's
happy
or
not

I
'm
afraid
*NL*
your
happiness
would
bore
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
give
it
a
chance
,
''
she
said
.
Then
suddenly
all
her
passion
*NL*
of
grief
over
him
broke
out
.
``
But
it
does
matter
!
''
she
cried
.
``
And
you
*NL*
OUGHT
to
be
happy

*NL*
How
could
I
bear
to
think
your

be
a

*NL*
*NL*
``

than
the
folk

I

you

done
well

I

am
the

well

off

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

not

battle

about

as
far
as
I
can
see

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Mrs.
Morel
was
trembling
violently
.
Struggles
of
this
kind
*NL*
often
took
place
between
her
and
her
son
,
when
she
seemed
to
fight
for
*NL*
his
very
life
against
his
own
will
to
die
.
He
took
her
in
his
arms
.
She
*NL*
was
ill
and
pitiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
Little
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
So
long
as
you
do
n't
feel
life
's
*NL*
paltry
and
a
miserable
business
,
the
rest
does
n't
matter
,
happiness
or
*NL*
unhappiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pressed
him
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
want
you
to
be
happy
,
''
she
said
pathetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
my
dear
--
say
rather
you
want
me
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
felt
as
if
her
heart
would
break
for
him
.
At
this
rate
she
*NL*
knew
he
would
not
live
.
He
had
that
poignant
carelessness
about
himself
,
*NL*
his
own
suffering
,
his
own
life
,
which
is
a
form
of
slow
suicide
.
It
*NL*
almost
broke
her
heart
.
With
all
the
passion
of
her
strong
nature
she
*NL*
hated
Miriam
for
having
in
this
subtle
way
undermined
his
joy
.
It
did
*NL*
not
matter
to
her
that
Miriam
could
not
help
it
.
Miriam
did
it
,
and
she
*NL*
hated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wished
so
much
he
would
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
equal
to
be
his
*NL*
mate
--
educated
and
strong
.
But
he
would
not
look
at
anybody
above
him
*NL*
in
station
.
He
seemed
to
like
Mrs.
Dawes
.
At
any
rate
that
feeling
was
*NL*
wholesome
.
His
mother
prayed
and
prayed
for
him
,
that
he
might
not
be
*NL*
wasted
.
That
was
all
her
prayer
--
not
for
his
soul
or
his
righteousness
,
*NL*
but
that
he
might
not
be
wasted
.
And
while
he
slept
,
for
hours
and
hours
*NL*
she
thought
and
prayed
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drifted
away
from
Miriam
imperceptibly
,
without
knowing
he
was
going
.
*NL*
Arthur
only
left
the
army
to
be
married
.
The
baby
was
born
six
months
*NL*
after
his
wedding
.
Mrs.
Morel
got
him
a
job
under
the
firm
again
,
at
*NL*
twenty-one
shillings
a
week
.
She
furnished
for
him
,
with
the
help
of
*NL*
Beatrice
's
mother
,
a
little
cottage
of
two
rooms
.
He
was
caught
now
.
It
*NL*
did
not
matter
how
he
kicked
and
struggled
,
he
was
fast
.
For
a
time
he
*NL*
chafed
,
was
irritable
with
his
young
wife
,
who
loved
him
;
he
went
almost
*NL*
distracted
when
the
baby
,
which
was
delicate
,
cried
or
gave
trouble
.
He
*NL*
grumbled
for
hours
to
his
mother
.
She
only
said
:
``
Well
,
my
lad
,
you
did
*NL*
it
yourself
,
now
you
must
make
the
best
of
it
.
''
And
then
the
grit
*NL*
came
out
in
him
.
He
buckled
to
work
,
undertook
his
responsibilities
,
*NL*
acknowledged
that
he
belonged
to
his
wife
and
child
,
and
did
make
a
good
*NL*
best
of
it
.
He
had
never
been
very
closely
inbound
into
the
family
.
Now
*NL*
he
was
gone
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
months
went
slowly
along
.
Paul
had
more
or
less
got
into
connection
*NL*
with
the
Socialist
,
Suffragette
,
Unitarian
people
in
Nottingham
,
owing
*NL*
to
his
acquaintance
with
Clara
.
One
day
a
friend
of
his
and
of
Clara
's
,
*NL*
in
Bestwood
,
asked
him
to
take
a
message
to
Mrs.
Dawes
.
He
went
in
the
*NL*
evening
across
Sneinton
Market
to
Bluebell
Hill
.
He
found
the
house
in
*NL*
a
mean
little
street
paved
with
granite
cobbles
and
having
causeways
of
*NL*
dark
blue
,
grooved
bricks
.
The
front
door
went
up
a
step
from
off
this
*NL*
rough
pavement
,
where
the
feet
of
the
passersby
rasped
and
clattered
.
*NL*
The
brown
paint
on
the
door
was
so
old
that
the
naked
wood
showed
*NL*
between
the
rents
.
He
stood
on
the
street
below
and
knocked
.
There
came
*NL*
a
heavy
footstep
;
a
large
,
stout
woman
of
about
sixty
towered
above
him
.
*NL*
He
looked
up
at
her
from
the
pavement
.
She
had
a
rather
severe
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
admitted
him
into
the
parlour
,
which
opened
on
to
the
street
.
It
was
*NL*
a
small
,
stuffy
,
defunct
room
,
of
mahogany
,
and
deathly
enlargements
of
*NL*
photographs
of
departed
people
done
in
carbon
.
Mrs.
Radford
left
him
.
*NL*
She
was
stately
,
almost
martial
.
In
a
moment
Clara
appeared
.
She
flushed
*NL*
deeply
,
and
he
was
covered
with
confusion
.
It
seemed
as
if
she
did
not
*NL*
like
being
discovered
in
her
home
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
could
n't
be
your
voice
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
might
as
well
be
hung
for
a
sheep
as
for
a
lamb
.
She
invited
him
*NL*
out
of
the
mausoleum
of
a
parlour
into
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
a
little
,
darkish
room
too
,
but
it
was
smothered
in
white
lace
.
*NL*
The
mother
had
seated
herself
again
by
the
cupboard
,
and
was
drawing
*NL*
thread
from
a
vast
web
of
lace
.
A
clump
of
fluff
and
ravelled
cotton
was
*NL*
at
her
right
hand
,
a
heap
of
three-quarter-inch
lace
lay
on
her
*NL*
left
,
whilst
in
front
of
her
was
the
mountain
of
lace
web
,
piling
the
*NL*
hearthrug
.
Threads
of
curly
cotton
,
pulled
out
from
between
the
lengths
*NL*
of
lace
,
strewed
over
the
fender
and
the
fireplace
.
Paul
dared
not
go
*NL*
forward
,
for
fear
of
treading
on
piles
of
white
stuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
table
was
a
jenny
for
carding
the
lace
.
There
was
a
pack
of
brown
*NL*
cardboard
squares
,
a
pack
of
cards
of
lace
,
a
little
box
of
pins
,
and
on
*NL*
the
sofa
lay
a
heap
of
drawn
lace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
all
lace
,
and
it
was
so
dark
and
warm
that
the
white
,
snowy
*NL*
stuff
seemed
the
more
distinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
're
coming
in
you
wo
n't
have
to
mind
the
work
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Radford
.
``
I
know
we
're
about
blocked
up
.
But
sit
you
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
,
much
embarrassed
,
gave
him
a
chair
against
the
wall
opposite
the
*NL*
white
heaps
.
Then
she
herself
took
her
place
on
the
sofa
,
shamedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
drink
a
bottle
of
stout
?
''
Mrs.
Radford
asked
.
``
Clara
,
get
him
*NL*
a
bottle
of
stout
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
protested
,
but
Mrs.
Radford
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
as
if
you
could
do
with
it
,
''
she
said
.
``
Have
n't
you
never
any
*NL*
more
colour
than
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
a
thick
skin
I
've
got
that
does
n't
show
the
blood
through
,
''
*NL*
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
,
ashamed
and
chagrined
,
brought
him
a
bottle
of
stout
and
a
glass
.
*NL*
He
poured
out
some
of
the
black
stuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
lifting
the
glass
,
``
here
's
health
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
thank
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
Radford
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
drink
of
stout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
light
yourself
a
cigarette
,
so
long
as
you
do
n't
set
the
house
on
*NL*
fire
,
''
said
Mrs.
Radford
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
you
need
n't
thank
me
,
''
she
answered
.
``
I
s
'll
be
glad
to
smell
a
*NL*
bit
of
smoke
in
th
'
`
ouse
again
.
A
house
o
'
women
is
as
dead
as
a
house
*NL*
wi
'
no
fire
,
to
my
thinkin
'
.
I
'm
not
a
spider
as
likes
a
corner
to
*NL*
myself
.
I
like
a
man
about
,
if
he
's
only
something
to
snap
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
began
to
work
.
Her
jenny
spun
with
a
subdued
buzz
;
the
white
*NL*
lace
hopped
from
between
her
fingers
on
to
the
card
.
It
was
filled
;
she
*NL*
snipped
off
the
length
,
and
pinned
the
end
down
to
the
banded
lace
.
Then
*NL*
she
put
a
new
card
in
her
jenny
.
Paul
watched
her
.
She
sat
square
and
*NL*
magnificent
.
Her
throat
and
arms
were
bare
.
The
blood
still
mantled
*NL*
below
her
ears
;
she
bent
her
head
in
shame
of
her
humility
.
Her
face
was
*NL*
set
on
her
work
.
Her
arms
were
creamy
and
full
of
life
beside
the
white
*NL*
lace
;
her
large
,
well-kept
hands
worked
with
a
balanced
movement
,
as
if
*NL*
nothing
would
hurry
them
.
He
,
not
knowing
,
watched
her
all
the
time
.
He
*NL*
saw
the
arch
of
her
neck
from
the
shoulder
,
as
she
bent
her
head
;
he
saw
*NL*
the
coil
of
dun
hair
;
he
watched
her
moving
,
gleaming
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
heard
a
bit
about
you
from
Clara
,
''
continued
the
mother
.
``
You
're
*NL*
in
Jordan
's
,
are
n't
you
?
''
She
drew
her
lace
unceasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
well
,
and
I
can
remember
when
Thomas
Jordan
used
to
ask
ME
for
one
*NL*
of
my
toffies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
?
''
laughed
Paul
.
``
And
did
he
get
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
he
did
,
sometimes
he
did
n't
--
which
was
latterly
.
For
he
's
the
*NL*
sort
that
takes
all
and
gives
naught
,
he
is
--
or
used
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
's
very
decent
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
well
,
I
'm
glad
to
hear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Radford
looked
across
at
him
steadily
.
There
was
something
*NL*
determined
about
her
that
he
liked
.
Her
face
was
falling
loose
,
but
her
*NL*
eyes
were
calm
,
and
there
was
something
strong
in
her
that
made
it
*NL*
seem
she
was
not
old
;
merely
her
wrinkles
and
loose
cheeks
were
an
*NL*
anachronism
.
She
had
the
strength
and
sang-froid
of
a
woman
in
the
prime
*NL*
of
life
.
She
continued
drawing
the
lace
with
slow
,
dignified
movements
.
*NL*
The
big
web
came
up
inevitably
over
her
apron
;
the
length
of
lace
fell
*NL*
away
at
her
side
.
Her
arms
were
finely
shapen
,
but
glossy
and
yellow
*NL*
as
old
ivory
.
They
had
not
the
peculiar
dull
gleam
that
made
Clara
's
so
*NL*
fascinating
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
've
been
going
with
Miriam
Leivers
?
''
the
mother
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
's
a
nice
girl
,
''
she
continued
.
``
She
's
very
nice
,
but
she
's
a
*NL*
bit
too
much
above
this
world
to
suit
my
fancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
bit
like
that
,
''
he
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
never
be
satisfied
till
she
's
got
wings
and
can
fly
over
*NL*
everybody
's
head
,
she
wo
n't
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
broke
in
,
and
he
told
her
his
message
.
She
spoke
humbly
to
him
.
He
*NL*
had
surprised
her
in
her
drudgery
.
To
have
her
humble
made
him
feel
as
*NL*
if
he
were
lifting
his
head
in
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
jennying
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
a
woman
do
!
''
she
replied
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
sweated
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
or
less
.
Is
n't
ALL
woman
's
work
?
That
's
another
trick
the
men
have
*NL*
played
,
since
we
force
ourselves
into
the
labour
market
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
,
you
shut
up
about
the
men
,
''
said
her
mother
.
``
If
the
women
*NL*
was
n't
fools
,
the
men
would
n't
be
bad
uns
,
that
's
what
I
say
.
No
man
was
*NL*
ever
that
bad
wi
'
me
but
what
he
got
it
back
again
.
Not
but
what
they
're
*NL*
a
lousy
lot
,
there
's
no
denying
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
're
all
right
really
,
are
n't
they
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
're
a
bit
different
from
women
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
care
to
be
back
at
Jordan
's
?
''
he
asked
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
would
!
''
cried
her
mother
;
``
thank
her
stars
if
she
could
get
*NL*
back
.
Do
n't
you
listen
to
her
.
She
's
for
ever
on
that
`
igh
horse
of
*NL*
hers
,
an
'
it
's
back
's
that
thin
an
'
starved
it
'll
cut
her
in
two
one
of
*NL*
these
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
suffered
badly
from
her
mother
.
Paul
felt
as
if
his
eyes
were
*NL*
coming
very
wide
open
.
Was
n't
he
to
take
Clara
's
fulminations
so
*NL*
seriously
,
after
all
?
She
spun
steadily
at
her
work
.
He
experienced
a
*NL*
thrill
of
joy
,
thinking
she
might
need
his
help
.
She
seemed
denied
and
*NL*
deprived
of
so
much
.
And
her
arm
moved
mechanically
,
that
should
never
*NL*
have
been
subdued
to
a
mechanism
,
and
her
head
was
bowed
to
the
lace
,
*NL*
that
never
should
have
been
bowed
.
She
seemed
to
be
stranded
there
*NL*
among
the
refuse
that
life
has
thrown
away
,
doing
her
jennying
.
It
was
*NL*
a
bitter
thing
to
her
to
be
put
aside
by
life
,
as
if
it
had
no
use
for
*NL*
her
.
No
wonder
she
protested
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
with
him
to
the
door
.
He
stood
below
in
the
mean
street
,
*NL*
looking
up
at
her
.
So
fine
she
was
in
her
stature
and
her
bearing
,
she
*NL*
reminded
him
of
Juno
dethroned
.
As
she
stood
in
the
doorway
,
she
winced
*NL*
from
the
street
,
from
her
surroundings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
will
go
with
Mrs.
Hodgkisson
to
Hucknall
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
talking
quite
meaninglessly
,
only
watching
her
.
Her
grey
eyes
at
*NL*
last
met
his
.
They
looked
dumb
with
humiliation
,
pleading
with
a
kind
of
*NL*
captive
misery
.
He
was
shaken
and
at
a
loss
.
He
had
thought
her
high
and
*NL*
mighty
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
left
her
,
he
wanted
to
run
.
He
went
to
the
station
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
dream
,
and
was
at
home
without
realising
he
had
moved
out
of
her
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
an
idea
that
Susan
,
the
overseer
of
the
Spiral
girls
,
was
about
*NL*
to
be
married
.
He
asked
her
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Susan
,
I
heard
a
whisper
of
your
getting
married
.
What
about
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
flushed
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
been
talking
to
you
?
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
.
I
merely
heard
a
whisper
that
you
WERE
thinking
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
am
,
though
you
need
n't
tell
anybody
.
What
's
more
,
I
wish
I
*NL*
was
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Susan
,
you
wo
n't
make
me
believe
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
n't
I
?
You
CAN
believe
it
,
though
.
I
'd
rather
stop
here
a
thousand
*NL*
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
perturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Susan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
's
colour
was
high
,
and
her
eyes
flashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
why
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
must
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
answer
,
she
looked
at
him
.
There
was
about
him
a
candour
and
*NL*
gentleness
which
made
the
women
trust
him
.
He
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
'm
sorry
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tears
came
to
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
see
it
'll
turn
out
all
right
.
You
'll
make
the
best
of
it
,
''
*NL*
he
continued
rather
wistfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
else
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yea
,
there
's
making
the
worst
of
it
.
Try
and
make
it
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
made
occasion
to
call
again
on
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
care
to
come
back
to
Jordan
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
down
her
work
,
laid
her
beautiful
arms
on
the
table
,
and
looked
*NL*
at
him
for
some
moments
without
answering
.
Gradually
the
flush
mounted
*NL*
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
felt
rather
awkward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
because
Susan
is
thinking
of
leaving
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
went
on
with
her
jennying
.
The
white
lace
leaped
in
little
jumps
*NL*
and
bounds
on
to
the
card
.
He
waited
for
her
.
Without
raising
her
head
,
*NL*
she
said
at
last
,
in
a
peculiar
low
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
said
anything
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Except
to
you
,
not
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
again
a
long
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
apply
when
the
advertisement
is
out
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
apply
before
that
.
I
will
let
you
know
exactly
when
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
spinning
her
little
machine
,
and
did
not
contradict
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
came
to
Jordan
's
.
Some
of
the
older
hands
,
Fanny
among
them
,
*NL*
remembered
her
earlier
rule
,
and
cordially
disliked
the
memory
.
Clara
*NL*
had
always
been
``
ikey
''
,
reserved
,
and
superior
.
She
had
never
mixed
with
*NL*
the
girls
as
one
of
themselves
.
If
she
had
occasion
to
find
fault
,
she
*NL*
did
it
coolly
and
with
perfect
politeness
,
which
the
defaulter
felt
to
*NL*
be
a
bigger
insult
than
crassness
.
Towards
Fanny
,
the
poor
,
overstrung
*NL*
hunchback
,
Clara
was
unfailingly
compassionate
and
gentle
,
as
a
result
*NL*
of
which
Fanny
shed
more
bitter
tears
than
ever
the
rough
tongues
of
the
*NL*
other
overseers
had
caused
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
in
Clara
that
Paul
disliked
,
and
much
that
piqued
*NL*
him
.
If
she
were
about
,
he
always
watched
her
strong
throat
or
her
neck
,
*NL*
upon
which
the
blonde
hair
grew
low
and
fluffy
.
There
was
a
fine
down
,
*NL*
almost
invisible
,
upon
the
skin
of
her
face
and
arms
,
and
when
once
he
*NL*
had
perceived
it
,
he
saw
it
always
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
at
his
work
,
painting
in
the
afternoon
,
she
would
come
and
*NL*
stand
near
to
him
,
perfectly
motionless
.
Then
he
felt
her
,
though
she
*NL*
neither
spoke
nor
touched
him
.
Although
she
stood
a
yard
away
he
felt
*NL*
as
if
he
were
in
contact
with
her
.
Then
he
could
paint
no
more
.
He
flung
*NL*
down
the
brushes
,
and
turned
to
talk
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
she
praised
his
work
;
sometimes
she
was
critical
and
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
affected
in
that
piece
,
''
she
would
say
;
and
,
as
there
was
an
*NL*
element
of
truth
in
her
condemnation
,
his
blood
boiled
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
:
``
What
of
this
?
''
he
would
ask
enthusiastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
She
made
a
small
doubtful
sound
.
``
It
does
n't
interest
me
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
do
n't
understand
it
,
''
he
retorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
ask
me
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
thought
you
would
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
shrug
her
shoulders
in
scorn
of
his
work
.
She
maddened
him
.
He
*NL*
was
furious
.
Then
he
abused
her
,
and
went
into
passionate
exposition
of
*NL*
his
stuff
.
This
amused
and
stimulated
her
.
But
she
never
owned
that
she
*NL*
had
been
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
ten
years
that
she
had
belonged
to
the
women
's
movement
*NL*
she
had
acquired
a
fair
amount
of
education
,
and
,
having
had
some
of
*NL*
Miriam
's
passion
to
be
instructed
,
had
taught
herself
French
,
and
could
*NL*
read
in
that
language
with
a
struggle
.
She
considered
herself
as
a
woman
*NL*
apart
,
and
particularly
apart
,
from
her
class
.
The
girls
in
the
Spiral
*NL*
department
were
all
of
good
homes
.
It
was
a
small
,
special
industry
,
and
*NL*
had
a
certain
distinction
.
There
was
an
air
of
refinement
in
both
rooms
.
*NL*
But
Clara
was
aloof
also
from
her
fellow-workers
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
these
things
,
however
,
did
she
reveal
to
Paul
.
She
was
not
the
*NL*
one
to
give
herself
away
.
There
was
a
sense
of
mystery
about
her
.
She
*NL*
was
so
reserved
,
he
felt
she
had
much
to
reserve
.
Her
history
was
open
*NL*
on
the
surface
,
but
its
inner
meaning
was
hidden
from
everybody
.
It
was
*NL*
exciting
.
And
then
sometimes
he
caught
her
looking
at
him
from
under
*NL*
her
brows
with
an
almost
furtive
,
sullen
scrutiny
,
which
made
him
move
*NL*
quickly
.
Often
she
met
his
eyes
.
But
then
her
own
were
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
covered
over
,
revealing
nothing
.
She
gave
him
a
little
,
lenient
smile
.
*NL*
She
was
to
him
extraordinarily
provocative
,
because
of
the
knowledge
she
*NL*
seemed
to
possess
,
and
gathered
fruit
of
experience
he
could
not
attain
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
picked
up
a
copy
of
_
Lettres
de
mon
Moulin
_
from
her
*NL*
work-bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
read
French
,
do
you
?
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
glanced
round
negligently
.
She
was
making
an
elastic
stocking
*NL*
of
heliotrope
silk
,
turning
the
Spiral
machine
with
slow
,
balanced
*NL*
regularity
,
occasionally
bending
down
to
see
her
work
or
to
adjust
the
*NL*
needles
;
then
her
magnificent
neck
,
with
its
down
and
fine
pencils
of
*NL*
hair
,
shone
white
against
the
lavender
,
lustrous
silk
.
She
turned
a
few
*NL*
more
rounds
,
and
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
say
?
''
she
asked
,
smiling
sweetly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
's
eyes
glittered
at
her
insolent
indifference
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
know
you
read
French
,
''
he
said
,
very
polite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
not
?
''
she
replied
,
with
a
faint
,
sarcastic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rotten
swank
!
''
he
said
,
but
scarcely
loud
enough
to
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shut
his
mouth
angrily
as
he
watched
her
.
She
seemed
to
scorn
the
*NL*
work
she
mechanically
produced
;
yet
the
hose
she
made
were
as
nearly
*NL*
perfect
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
like
Spiral
work
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
all
work
is
work
,
''
she
answered
,
as
if
she
knew
all
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
marvelled
at
her
coldness
.
He
had
to
do
everything
hotly
.
She
must
be
*NL*
something
special
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
prefer
to
do
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
at
him
indulgently
,
as
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
so
little
likelihood
of
my
ever
being
given
a
choice
,
that
I
*NL*
have
n't
wasted
time
considering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pah
!
''
he
said
,
contemptuous
on
his
side
now
.
``
You
only
say
that
because
*NL*
you
're
too
proud
to
own
up
what
you
want
and
ca
n't
get
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
me
very
well
,
''
she
replied
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
think
you
're
terrific
great
shakes
,
and
that
you
live
under
*NL*
the
eternal
insult
of
working
in
a
factory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
angry
and
very
rude
.
She
merely
turned
away
from
him
in
*NL*
disdain
.
He
walked
whistling
down
the
room
,
flirted
and
laughed
with
*NL*
Hilda
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
he
said
to
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
I
so
impudent
to
Clara
for
?
''
He
was
rather
annoyed
with
*NL*
himself
,
at
the
same
time
glad
.
``
Serve
her
right
;
she
stinks
with
silent
*NL*
pride
,
''
he
said
to
himself
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
he
came
down
.
There
was
a
certain
weight
on
his
*NL*
heart
which
he
wanted
to
remove
.
He
thought
to
do
it
by
offering
her
*NL*
chocolates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
one
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
bought
a
handful
to
sweeten
me
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
his
great
relief
,
she
accepted
.
He
sat
on
the
work-bench
beside
her
*NL*
machine
,
twisting
a
piece
of
silk
round
his
finger
.
She
loved
him
for
*NL*
his
quick
,
unexpected
movements
,
like
a
young
animal
.
His
feet
swung
*NL*
as
he
pondered
.
The
sweets
lay
strewn
on
the
bench
.
She
bent
over
her
*NL*
machine
,
grinding
rhythmically
,
then
stooping
to
see
the
stocking
*NL*
that
hung
beneath
,
pulled
down
by
the
weight
.
He
watched
the
handsome
*NL*
crouching
of
her
back
,
and
the
apron-strings
curling
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
always
about
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
a
sort
of
waiting
.
Whatever
I
see
*NL*
you
doing
,
you
're
not
really
there
:
you
are
waiting
--
like
Penelope
when
*NL*
she
did
her
weaving
.
''
He
could
not
help
a
spurt
of
wickedness
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
call
you
Penelope
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
it
make
any
difference
?
''
she
said
,
carefully
removing
one
of
her
*NL*
needles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
does
n't
matter
,
so
long
as
it
pleases
me
.
Here
,
I
say
,
you
seem
to
*NL*
forget
I
'm
your
boss
.
It
just
occurs
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
that
mean
?
''
she
asked
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
I
've
got
a
right
to
boss
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
anything
you
want
to
complain
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
say
,
you
need
n't
be
nasty
,
''
he
said
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
want
,
''
she
said
,
continuing
her
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
to
treat
me
nicely
and
respectfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
you
`
sir
'
,
perhaps
?
''
she
asked
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
call
me
`
sir
'
.
I
should
love
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
wish
you
would
go
upstairs
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mouth
closed
,
and
a
frown
came
on
his
face
.
He
jumped
suddenly
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
too
blessed
superior
for
anything
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
away
to
the
other
girls
.
He
felt
he
was
being
angrier
than
*NL*
he
had
any
need
to
be
.
In
fact
,
he
doubted
slightly
that
he
was
showing
*NL*
off
.
But
if
he
were
,
then
he
would
.
Clara
heard
him
laughing
,
in
a
way
*NL*
she
hated
,
with
the
girls
down
the
next
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
at
evening
he
went
through
the
department
after
the
girls
had
gone
,
*NL*
he
saw
his
chocolates
lying
untouched
in
front
of
Clara
's
machine
.
He
*NL*
left
them
.
In
the
morning
they
were
still
there
,
and
Clara
was
at
work
.
*NL*
Later
on
Minnie
,
a
little
brunette
they
called
Pussy
,
called
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
,
have
n't
you
got
a
chocolate
for
anybody
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry
,
Pussy
,
''
he
replied
.
``
I
meant
to
have
offered
them
;
then
I
went
*NL*
and
forgot
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
did
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
bring
you
some
this
afternoon
.
You
do
n't
want
them
after
they
've
*NL*
been
lying
about
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
not
particular
,
''
smiled
Pussy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
'll
be
dusty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
up
to
Clara
's
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry
I
left
these
things
littering
about
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
scarlet
.
He
gathered
them
together
in
his
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
be
dirty
now
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
should
have
taken
them
.
I
wonder
*NL*
why
you
did
n't
.
I
meant
to
have
told
you
I
wanted
you
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
flung
them
out
of
the
window
into
the
yard
below
.
He
just
glanced
at
*NL*
her
.
She
winced
from
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
he
brought
another
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
take
some
?
''
he
said
,
offering
them
first
to
Clara
.
``
These
are
*NL*
fresh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
accepted
one
,
and
put
it
on
to
the
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
take
several
--
for
luck
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
a
couple
more
,
and
put
them
on
the
bench
also
.
Then
she
turned
*NL*
in
confusion
to
her
work
.
He
went
on
up
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
Pussy
,
''
he
said
.
``
Do
n't
be
greedy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
all
for
her
?
''
cried
the
others
,
rushing
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
they
're
not
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
clamoured
round
.
Pussy
drew
back
from
her
mates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
out
!
''
she
cried
.
``
I
can
have
first
pick
,
ca
n't
I
,
Paul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
nice
with
'em
,
''
he
said
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ARE
a
dear
,
''
the
girls
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tenpence
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
past
Clara
without
speaking
.
She
felt
the
three
chocolate
creams
*NL*
would
burn
her
if
she
touched
them
.
It
needed
all
her
courage
to
slip
*NL*
them
into
the
pocket
of
her
apron
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
loved
him
and
were
afraid
of
him
.
He
was
so
nice
while
he
*NL*
was
nice
,
but
if
he
were
offended
,
so
distant
,
treating
them
as
if
they
*NL*
scarcely
existed
,
or
not
more
than
the
bobbins
of
thread
.
And
then
,
if
*NL*
they
were
impudent
,
he
said
quietly
:
``
Do
you
mind
going
on
with
your
*NL*
work
,
''
and
stood
and
watched
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
celebrated
his
twenty-third
birthday
,
the
house
was
in
trouble
.
*NL*
Arthur
was
just
going
to
be
married
.
His
mother
was
not
well
.
His
*NL*
father
,
getting
an
old
man
,
and
lame
from
his
accidents
,
was
given
*NL*
a
paltry
,
poor
job
.
Miriam
was
an
eternal
reproach
.
He
felt
he
owed
*NL*
himself
to
her
,
yet
could
not
give
himself
.
The
house
,
moreover
,
needed
*NL*
his
support
.
He
was
pulled
in
all
directions
.
He
was
not
glad
it
was
his
*NL*
birthday
.
It
made
him
bitter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
to
work
at
eight
o'clock
.
Most
of
the
clerks
had
not
turned
up
.
*NL*
The
girls
were
not
due
till
8.30
.
As
he
was
changing
his
coat
,
he
heard
*NL*
a
voice
behind
him
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
,
Paul
,
I
want
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Fanny
,
the
hunchback
,
standing
at
the
top
of
her
stairs
,
her
face
*NL*
radiant
with
a
secret
.
Paul
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
you
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
,
at
a
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
''
she
coaxed
.
``
Come
before
you
begin
on
the
letters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
down
the
half-dozen
steps
into
her
dry
,
narrow
,
``
finishing-off
''
*NL*
room
.
Fanny
walked
before
him
:
her
black
bodice
was
short
--
the
waist
was
*NL*
under
her
armpits
--
and
her
green-black
cashmere
skirt
seemed
very
*NL*
long
,
as
she
strode
with
big
strides
before
the
young
man
,
himself
so
*NL*
graceful
.
She
went
to
her
seat
at
the
narrow
end
of
the
room
,
where
the
*NL*
window
opened
on
to
chimney-pots
.
Paul
watched
her
thin
hands
and
her
*NL*
flat
red
wrists
as
she
excitedly
twitched
her
white
apron
,
which
was
*NL*
spread
on
the
bench
in
front
of
her
.
She
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
think
we
'd
forgot
you
?
''
she
asked
,
reproachful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
he
asked
.
He
had
forgotten
his
birthday
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Why
,
'
he
says
!
`
Why
!
'
Why
,
look
here
!
''
She
pointed
to
the
calendar
,
*NL*
and
he
saw
,
surrounding
the
big
black
number
``
21
''
,
hundreds
of
little
*NL*
crosses
in
black-lead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
kisses
for
my
birthday
,
''
he
laughed
.
``
How
did
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
want
to
know
,
do
n't
you
?
''
Fanny
mocked
,
hugely
delighted
.
*NL*
``
There
's
one
from
everybody
--
except
Lady
Clara
--
and
two
from
some
.
But
I
*NL*
sha
n't
tell
you
how
many
I
put
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know
,
you
're
spooney
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
ARE
mistaken
!
''
she
cried
,
indignant
.
``
I
could
never
be
so
*NL*
soft
.
''
Her
voice
was
strong
and
contralto
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
pretend
to
be
such
a
hard-hearted
hussy
,
''
he
laughed
.
``
And
*NL*
you
know
you
're
as
sentimental
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
be
called
sentimental
than
frozen
meat
,
''
Fanny
blurted
.
Paul
*NL*
knew
she
referred
to
Clara
,
and
he
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
say
such
nasty
things
about
me
?
''
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
duck
,
''
the
hunchback
woman
answered
,
lavishly
tender
.
She
was
*NL*
thirty-nine
.
``
No
,
my
duck
,
because
you
do
n't
think
yourself
a
fine
*NL*
figure
in
marble
and
us
nothing
but
dirt
.
I
'm
as
good
as
you
,
are
n't
I
,
*NL*
Paul
?
''
and
the
question
delighted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
we
're
not
better
than
one
another
,
are
we
?
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'm
as
good
as
you
,
are
n't
I
,
Paul
?
''
she
persisted
daringly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
are
.
If
it
comes
to
goodness
,
you
're
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
rather
afraid
of
the
situation
.
She
might
get
hysterical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
'd
get
here
before
the
others
--
wo
n't
they
say
I
'm
deep
!
Now
*NL*
shut
your
eyes
--
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
open
your
mouth
,
and
see
what
God
sends
you
,
''
he
continued
,
suiting
*NL*
action
to
words
,
and
expecting
a
piece
of
chocolate
.
He
heard
the
rustle
*NL*
of
the
apron
,
and
a
faint
clink
of
metal
.
``
I
'm
going
to
look
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
his
eyes
.
Fanny
,
her
long
cheeks
flushed
,
her
blue
eyes
*NL*
shining
,
was
gazing
at
him
.
There
was
a
little
bundle
of
paint-tubes
on
*NL*
the
bench
before
him
.
He
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Fanny
,
''
he
said
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
us
all
,
''
she
answered
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
the
right
sort
?
''
she
asked
,
rocking
herself
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jove
!
they
're
the
best
in
the
catalogue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
're
the
right
sorts
?
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
off
the
little
list
I
'd
made
to
get
when
my
ship
came
in
.
''
He
*NL*
bit
his
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
overcome
with
emotion
.
She
must
turn
the
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
was
all
on
thorns
to
do
it
;
they
all
paid
their
shares
,
all
except
*NL*
the
Queen
of
Sheba
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Queen
of
Sheba
was
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
would
n't
she
join
?
''
Paul
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
n't
get
the
chance
;
we
never
told
her
;
we
was
n't
going
to
have
*NL*
HER
bossing
THIS
show
.
We
did
n't
WANT
her
to
join
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
laughed
at
the
woman
.
He
was
much
moved
.
At
last
he
must
go
.
She
*NL*
was
very
close
to
him
.
Suddenly
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
*NL*
kissed
him
vehemently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
give
you
a
kiss
to-day
,
''
she
said
apologetically
.
``
You
've
looked
*NL*
so
white
,
it
's
made
my
heart
ache
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
kissed
her
,
and
left
her
.
Her
arms
were
so
pitifully
thin
that
his
*NL*
heart
ached
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
he
met
Clara
as
he
ran
downstairs
to
wash
his
hands
at
*NL*
dinner-time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
stayed
to
dinner
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
It
was
unusual
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
I
seem
to
have
dined
on
old
surgical-appliance
stock
.
I
MUST
*NL*
go
out
now
,
or
I
shall
feel
stale
india-rubber
right
through
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lingered
.
He
instantly
caught
at
her
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
anywhere
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
together
up
to
the
Castle
.
Outdoors
she
dressed
very
plainly
,
*NL*
down
to
ugliness
;
indoors
she
always
looked
nice
.
She
walked
with
*NL*
hesitating
steps
alongside
Paul
,
bowing
and
turning
away
from
him
.
*NL*
Dowdy
in
dress
,
and
drooping
,
she
showed
to
great
disadvantage
.
He
could
*NL*
scarcely
recognise
her
strong
form
,
that
seemed
to
slumber
with
power
.
*NL*
She
appeared
almost
insignificant
,
drowning
her
stature
in
her
stoop
,
as
*NL*
she
shrank
from
the
public
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Castle
grounds
were
very
green
and
fresh
.
Climbing
the
precipitous
*NL*
ascent
,
he
laughed
and
chattered
,
but
she
was
silent
,
seeming
to
brood
*NL*
over
something
.
There
was
scarcely
time
to
go
inside
the
squat
,
square
*NL*
building
that
crowns
the
bluff
of
rock
.
They
leaned
upon
the
wall
where
*NL*
the
cliff
runs
sheer
down
to
the
Park
.
Below
them
,
in
their
holes
in
the
*NL*
sandstone
,
pigeons
preened
themselves
and
cooed
softly
.
Away
down
upon
*NL*
the
boulevard
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
,
tiny
trees
stood
in
their
*NL*
own
pools
of
shadow
,
and
tiny
people
went
scurrying
about
in
almost
*NL*
ludicrous
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
feel
as
if
you
could
scoop
up
the
folk
like
tadpoles
,
and
have
a
*NL*
handful
of
them
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
,
answering
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
far
off
in
order
to
see
us
*NL*
proportionately
.
The
trees
are
much
more
significant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bulk
only
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
cynically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Away
beyond
the
boulevard
the
thin
stripes
of
the
metals
showed
upon
the
*NL*
railway-track
,
whose
margin
was
crowded
with
little
stacks
of
timber
,
*NL*
beside
which
smoking
toy
engines
fussed
.
Then
the
silver
string
of
the
*NL*
canal
lay
at
random
among
the
black
heaps
.
Beyond
,
the
dwellings
,
very
*NL*
dense
on
the
river
flat
,
looked
like
black
,
poisonous
herbage
,
in
thick
*NL*
rows
and
crowded
beds
,
stretching
right
away
,
broken
now
and
then
by
*NL*
taller
plants
,
right
to
where
the
river
glistened
in
a
hieroglyph
across
*NL*
the
country
.
The
steep
scarp
cliffs
across
the
river
looked
puny
.
Great
*NL*
stretches
of
country
darkened
with
trees
and
faintly
brightened
with
*NL*
corn-land
,
spread
towards
the
haze
,
where
the
hills
rose
blue
beyond
*NL*
grey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
comforting
,
''
said
Mrs.
Dawes
,
``
to
think
the
town
goes
no
farther
.
*NL*
It
is
only
a
LITTLE
sore
upon
the
country
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
scab
,
''
Paul
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shivered
.
She
loathed
the
town
.
Looking
drearily
across
at
the
*NL*
country
which
was
forbidden
her
,
her
impassive
face
,
pale
and
hostile
,
*NL*
she
reminded
Paul
of
one
of
the
bitter
,
remorseful
angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
town
's
all
right
,
''
he
said
;
``
it
's
only
temporary
.
This
is
the
*NL*
crude
,
clumsy
make-shift
we
've
practised
on
,
till
we
find
out
what
the
*NL*
idea
is
.
The
town
will
come
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
pigeons
in
the
pockets
of
rock
,
among
the
perched
bushes
,
cooed
*NL*
comfortably
.
To
the
left
the
large
church
of
St.
Mary
rose
into
space
,
*NL*
to
keep
close
company
with
the
Castle
,
above
the
heaped
rubble
of
the
*NL*
town
.
Mrs.
Dawes
smiled
brightly
as
she
looked
across
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
better
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Great
compliment
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
brother
!
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
that
's
snatching
back
with
the
left
hand
what
you
gave
with
the
*NL*
right
,
and
no
mistake
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
in
amusement
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
was
the
matter
with
you
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
know
you
were
brooding
*NL*
something
special
.
I
can
see
the
stamp
of
it
on
your
face
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
will
not
tell
you
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
hug
it
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
and
bit
her
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
``
it
was
the
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
'em
?
''
Paul
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
been
plotting
something
for
a
week
now
,
and
to-day
they
seem
*NL*
particularly
full
of
it
.
All
alike
;
they
insult
me
with
their
secrecy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
they
?
''
he
asked
in
concern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
mind
,
''
she
went
on
,
in
the
metallic
,
angry
tone
,
``
if
they
*NL*
did
not
thrust
it
into
my
face
--
the
fact
that
they
have
a
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
like
women
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
hateful
,
their
mean
gloating
,
''
she
said
intensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
silent
.
He
knew
what
the
girls
gloated
over
.
He
was
sorry
to
be
*NL*
the
cause
of
this
new
dissension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
can
have
all
the
secrets
in
the
world
,
''
she
went
on
,
brooding
*NL*
bitterly
;
``
but
they
might
refrain
from
glorying
in
them
,
and
making
me
*NL*
feel
more
out
of
it
than
ever
.
It
is
--
it
is
almost
unbearable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
thought
for
a
few
minutes
.
He
was
much
perturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
what
it
's
all
about
,
''
he
said
,
pale
and
nervous
.
``
It
's
*NL*
my
birthday
,
and
they
've
bought
me
a
fine
lot
of
paints
,
all
the
*NL*
girls
.
They
're
jealous
of
you
''
--
he
felt
her
stiffen
coldly
at
the
word
*NL*
`
jealous
'
--
``
merely
because
I
sometimes
bring
you
a
book
,
''
he
added
*NL*
slowly
.
``
But
,
you
see
,
it
's
only
a
trifle
.
Do
n't
bother
about
it
,
will
*NL*
you
--
because
''
--
he
laughed
quickly
--
``
well
,
what
would
they
say
if
they
*NL*
saw
us
here
now
,
in
spite
of
their
victory
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
angry
with
him
for
his
clumsy
reference
to
their
present
*NL*
intimacy
.
It
was
almost
insolent
of
him
.
Yet
he
was
so
quiet
,
she
*NL*
forgave
him
,
although
it
cost
her
an
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
two
hands
lay
on
the
rough
stone
parapet
of
the
Castle
wall
.
He
*NL*
had
inherited
from
his
mother
a
fineness
of
mould
,
so
that
his
hands
*NL*
were
small
and
vigorous
.
Hers
were
large
,
to
match
her
large
limbs
,
but
*NL*
white
and
powerful
looking
.
As
Paul
looked
at
them
he
knew
her
.
``
She
is
*NL*
wanting
somebody
to
take
her
hands
--
for
all
she
is
so
contemptuous
of
*NL*
us
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
And
she
saw
nothing
but
his
two
hands
,
so
warm
*NL*
and
alive
,
which
seemed
to
live
for
her
.
He
was
brooding
now
,
staring
*NL*
out
over
the
country
from
under
sullen
brows
.
The
little
,
interesting
*NL*
diversity
of
shapes
had
vanished
from
the
scene
;
all
that
remained
was
a
*NL*
vast
,
dark
matrix
of
sorrow
and
tragedy
,
the
same
in
all
the
houses
*NL*
and
the
river-flats
and
the
people
and
the
birds
;
they
were
only
shapen
*NL*
differently
.
And
now
that
the
forms
seemed
to
have
melted
away
,
there
*NL*
remained
the
mass
from
which
all
the
landscape
was
composed
,
a
dark
mass
*NL*
of
struggle
and
pain
.
The
factory
,
the
girls
,
his
mother
,
the
*NL*
large
,
uplifted
church
,
the
thicket
of
the
town
,
merged
into
one
*NL*
atmosphere
--
dark
,
brooding
,
and
sorrowful
,
every
bit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
two
o'clock
striking
?
''
Mrs.
Dawes
said
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
started
,
and
everything
sprang
into
form
,
regained
its
*NL*
individuality
,
its
forgetfulness
,
and
its
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
hurried
back
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
in
the
rush
of
preparing
for
the
night
's
post
,
examining
the
*NL*
work
up
from
Fanny
's
room
,
which
smelt
of
ironing
,
the
evening
postman
*NL*
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Mr.
Paul
Morel
,
'
''
he
said
,
smiling
,
handing
Paul
a
package
.
``
A
lady
's
*NL*
handwriting
!
Do
n't
let
the
girls
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
postman
,
himself
a
favourite
,
was
pleased
to
make
fun
of
the
girls
'
*NL*
affection
for
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
volume
of
verse
with
a
brief
note
:
``
You
will
allow
me
to
send
*NL*
you
this
,
and
so
spare
me
my
isolation
.
I
also
sympathise
and
wish
you
*NL*
well
.
--
C.D.
''
Paul
flushed
hot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Lord
!
Mrs.
Dawes
.
She
ca
n't
afford
it
.
Good
Lord
,
who
ever
'd
have
*NL*
thought
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
suddenly
intensely
moved
.
He
was
filled
with
the
warmth
of
her
.
*NL*
In
the
glow
he
could
almost
feel
her
as
if
she
were
present
--
her
arms
,
*NL*
her
shoulders
,
her
bosom
,
see
them
,
feel
them
,
almost
contain
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
move
on
the
part
of
Clara
brought
them
into
closer
intimacy
.
The
*NL*
other
girls
noticed
that
when
Paul
met
Mrs.
Dawes
his
eyes
lifted
and
*NL*
gave
that
peculiar
bright
greeting
which
they
could
interpret
.
Knowing
*NL*
he
was
unaware
,
Clara
made
no
sign
,
save
that
occasionally
she
turned
*NL*
aside
her
face
from
him
when
he
came
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
out
together
very
often
at
dinner-time
;
it
was
quite
open
,
*NL*
quite
frank
.
Everybody
seemed
to
feel
that
he
was
quite
unaware
of
the
*NL*
state
of
his
own
feeling
,
and
that
nothing
was
wrong
.
He
talked
to
her
*NL*
now
with
some
of
the
old
fervour
with
which
he
had
talked
to
Miriam
,
but
*NL*
he
cared
less
about
the
talk
;
he
did
not
bother
about
his
conclusions
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
in
October
they
went
out
to
Lambley
for
tea
.
Suddenly
they
came
*NL*
to
a
halt
on
top
of
the
hill
.
He
climbed
and
sat
on
a
gate
,
she
sat
*NL*
on
the
stile
.
The
afternoon
was
perfectly
still
,
with
a
dim
haze
,
and
*NL*
yellow
sheaves
glowing
through
.
They
were
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
were
you
when
you
married
?
''
he
asked
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
was
subdued
,
almost
submissive
.
She
would
tell
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
eight
years
ago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
did
you
leave
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
years
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
years
!
Did
you
love
him
when
you
married
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
for
some
time
;
then
she
said
slowly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
did
--
more
or
less
.
I
did
n't
think
much
about
it
.
And
he
*NL*
wanted
me
.
I
was
very
prudish
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
sort
of
walked
into
it
without
thinking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
seemed
to
have
been
asleep
nearly
all
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Somnambule
_
?
But
--
when
did
you
wake
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
that
I
ever
did
,
or
ever
have
--
since
I
was
a
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
went
to
sleep
as
you
grew
to
be
a
woman
?
How
queer
!
And
he
did
n't
*NL*
wake
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
he
never
got
there
,
''
she
replied
,
in
a
monotone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brown
birds
dashed
over
the
hedges
where
the
rose-hips
stood
naked
*NL*
and
scarlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
where
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
me
.
He
never
really
mattered
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
was
so
gently
warm
and
dim
.
Red
roofs
of
the
cottages
*NL*
burned
among
the
blue
haze
.
He
loved
the
day
.
He
could
feel
,
but
he
*NL*
could
not
understand
,
what
Clara
was
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
did
you
leave
him
?
Was
he
horrid
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shuddered
lightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
--
he
sort
of
degraded
me
.
He
wanted
to
bully
me
because
he
had
n't
*NL*
got
me
.
And
then
I
felt
as
if
I
wanted
to
run
,
as
if
I
was
fastened
and
*NL*
bound
up
.
And
he
seemed
dirty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
at
all
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
was
he
always
dirty
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bit
,
''
she
replied
slowly
.
``
And
then
he
seemed
as
if
he
could
n't
get
*NL*
AT
me
,
really
.
And
then
he
got
brutal
--
he
WAS
brutal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
did
you
leave
him
finally
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
--
because
he
was
unfaithful
to
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
silent
for
some
time
.
Her
hand
lay
on
the
gate-post
as
*NL*
she
balanced
.
He
put
his
own
over
it
.
His
heart
beat
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
you
--
were
you
ever
--
did
you
ever
give
him
a
chance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chance
?
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
come
near
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
married
him
--
and
I
was
willing
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
strove
to
keep
their
voices
steady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
he
loves
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
like
it
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wanted
to
take
his
hand
away
,
and
could
not
.
She
saved
him
by
*NL*
removing
her
own
.
After
a
silence
,
he
began
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
leave
him
out
of
count
all
along
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
left
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
suppose
he
could
n't
MAKE
himself
mean
everything
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
tried
to
bully
me
into
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
conversation
had
got
them
both
out
of
their
depth
.
Suddenly
Paul
*NL*
jumped
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
''
he
said
.
``
Let
's
go
and
get
some
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
a
cottage
,
where
they
sat
in
the
cold
parlour
.
She
poured
out
*NL*
his
tea
.
She
was
very
quiet
.
He
felt
she
had
withdrawn
again
from
him
.
*NL*
After
tea
,
she
stared
broodingly
into
her
tea-cup
,
twisting
her
wedding
*NL*
ring
all
the
time
.
In
her
abstraction
she
took
the
ring
off
her
finger
,
*NL*
stood
it
up
,
and
spun
it
upon
the
table
.
The
gold
became
a
diaphanous
,
*NL*
glittering
globe
.
It
fell
,
and
the
ring
was
quivering
upon
the
table
.
*NL*
She
spun
it
again
and
again
.
Paul
watched
,
fascinated
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
a
married
woman
,
and
he
believed
in
simple
friendship
.
And
*NL*
he
considered
that
he
was
perfectly
honourable
with
regard
to
her
.
*NL*
It
was
only
a
friendship
between
man
and
woman
,
such
as
any
civilised
*NL*
persons
might
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
like
so
many
young
men
of
his
own
age
.
Sex
had
become
so
*NL*
complicated
in
him
that
he
would
have
denied
that
he
ever
could
want
*NL*
Clara
or
Miriam
or
any
woman
whom
he
knew
.
Sex
desire
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
detached
thing
,
that
did
not
belong
to
a
woman
.
He
loved
Miriam
with
his
*NL*
soul
.
He
grew
warm
at
the
thought
of
Clara
,
he
battled
with
her
,
he
*NL*
knew
the
curves
of
her
breast
and
shoulders
as
if
they
had
been
moulded
*NL*
inside
him
;
and
yet
he
did
not
positively
desire
her
.
He
would
have
*NL*
denied
it
for
ever
.
He
believed
himself
really
bound
to
Miriam
.
If
ever
*NL*
he
should
marry
,
some
time
in
the
far
future
,
it
would
be
his
duty
to
*NL*
marry
Miriam
.
That
he
gave
Clara
to
understand
,
and
she
said
nothing
,
*NL*
but
left
him
to
his
courses
.
He
came
to
her
,
Mrs.
Dawes
,
whenever
*NL*
he
could
.
Then
he
wrote
frequently
to
Miriam
,
and
visited
the
girl
*NL*
occasionally
.
So
he
went
on
through
the
winter
;
but
he
seemed
not
so
*NL*
fretted
.
His
mother
was
easier
about
him
.
She
thought
he
was
getting
*NL*
away
from
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
knew
now
how
strong
was
the
attraction
of
Clara
for
him
;
but
*NL*
still
she
was
certain
that
the
best
in
him
would
triumph
.
His
feeling
*NL*
for
Mrs.
Dawes
--
who
,
moreover
,
was
a
married
woman
--
was
shallow
and
*NL*
temporal
,
compared
with
his
love
for
herself
.
He
would
come
back
to
her
,
*NL*
she
was
sure
;
with
some
of
his
young
freshness
gone
,
perhaps
,
but
cured
*NL*
of
his
desire
for
the
lesser
things
which
other
women
than
herself
could
*NL*
give
him
.
She
could
bear
all
if
he
were
inwardly
true
to
her
and
must
*NL*
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
none
of
the
anomaly
of
his
position
.
Miriam
was
his
old
friend
,
*NL*
lover
,
and
she
belonged
to
Bestwood
and
home
and
his
youth
.
Clara
was
a
*NL*
newer
friend
,
and
she
belonged
to
Nottingham
,
to
life
,
to
the
world
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
him
quite
plain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dawes
and
he
had
many
periods
of
coolness
,
when
they
saw
little
of
*NL*
each
other
;
but
they
always
came
together
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
horrid
with
Baxter
Dawes
?
''
he
asked
her
.
It
was
a
thing
that
*NL*
seemed
to
trouble
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
.
But
were
n't
you
horrid
with
him
?
Did
n't
you
do
*NL*
something
that
knocked
him
to
pieces
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
pray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Making
him
feel
as
if
he
were
nothing
--
I
know
,
''
Paul
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
so
clever
,
my
friend
,
''
she
said
coolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
broke
off
there
.
But
it
made
her
cool
with
him
for
some
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
very
rarely
saw
Miriam
now
.
The
friendship
between
the
two
women
was
*NL*
not
broken
off
,
but
considerably
weakened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
come
in
to
the
concert
on
Sunday
afternoon
?
''
Clara
asked
him
*NL*
just
after
Christmas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promised
to
go
up
to
Willey
Farm
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mind
,
do
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
?
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
almost
annoyed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
he
said
,
``
Miriam
and
I
have
been
a
lot
to
each
other
ever
*NL*
since
I
was
sixteen
--
that
's
seven
years
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
long
time
,
''
Clara
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
somehow
she
--
it
does
n't
go
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
asked
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
seems
to
draw
me
and
draw
me

and
she
would
n't
leave

single
hair

me
free
to
fall
out
and
blow
away

she
'd
keep
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
like
to
be
kept

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
he
said
,
``
I
do
n't

I
wish
it
could
be
normal

give

take

like
*NL*

I
want

woman

keep
me

not
in

pocket

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
you

it

n't
be
normal

like
me

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I

better

She
sort
of
wants

so
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wants

*NL*
``

And

``
No

Clara
asked

*NL*
``
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
're
afraid

''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not

Something
in
me
shrinks
from
her
like
hell

good

when
I
'm
not
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

what
she
is

*NL*
``
I

I

union

*NL*
``
But

*NL*
``
I
've
been
with

seven

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have

out

very

that

*NL*
He
pondered
over
this
.
Perhaps
he
was
wrong

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she

he
began

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
THE
TEST
ON
MIRIAM
*NL*
*NL*
WITH
the
spring
came
again
the
old
madness
and
battle
.
Now
he
knew
he
*NL*
would
have
to
go
to
Miriam
.
But
what
was
his
reluctance
?
He
told
himself
*NL*
it
was
only
a
sort
of
overstrong
virginity
in
her
and
him
which
neither
*NL*
could
break
through
.
He
might
have
married
her
;
but
his
circumstances
*NL*
at
home
made
it
difficult
,
and
,
moreover
,
he
did
not
want
to
marry
.
*NL*
Marriage
was
for
life
,
and
because
they
had
become
close
companions
,
he
*NL*
and
she
,
he
did
not
see
that
it
should
inevitably
follow
they
should
be
*NL*
man
and
wife
.
He
did
not
feel
that
he
wanted
marriage
with
Miriam
.
He
*NL*
wished
he
did
.
He
would
have
given
his
head
to
have
felt
a
joyous
desire
*NL*
to
marry
her
and
to
have
her
.
Then
why
could
n't
he
bring
it
off
?
There
*NL*
was
some
obstacle
;
and
what
was
the
obstacle
?
It
lay
in
the
physical
*NL*
bondage
.
He
shrank
from
the
physical
contact
.
But
why
?
With
her
he
felt
*NL*
bound
up
inside
himself
.
He
could
not
go
out
to
her
.
Something
struggled
*NL*
in
him
,
but
he
could
not
get
to
her
.
Why
?
She
loved
him
.
Clara
said
she
*NL*
even
wanted
him
;
then
why
could
n't
he
go
to
her
,
make
love
to
her
,
kiss
*NL*
her
?
Why
,
when
she
put
her
arm
in
his
,
timidly
,
as
they
walked
,
did
he
*NL*
feel
he
would
burst
forth
in
brutality
and
recoil
?
He
owed
himself
to
*NL*
her
;
he
wanted
to
belong
to
her
.
Perhaps
the
recoil
and
the
shrinking
*NL*
from
her
was
love
in
its
first
fierce
modesty
.
He
had
no
aversion
for
*NL*
her
.
No
,
it
was
the
opposite
;
it
was
a
strong
desire
battling
with
a
*NL*
still
stronger
shyness
and
virginity
.
It
seemed
as
if
virginity
were
a
*NL*
positive
force
,
which
fought
and
won
in
both
of
them
.
And
with
her
he
*NL*
felt
it
so
hard
to
overcome
;
yet
he
was
nearest
to
her
,
and
with
her
*NL*
alone
could
he
deliberately
break
through
.
And
he
owed
himself
to
her
.
*NL*
Then
,
if
they
could
get
things
right
,
they
could
marry
;
but
he
would
not
*NL*
marry
unless
he
could
feel
strong
in
the
joy
of
it
--
never
.
He
could
not
*NL*
have
faced
his
mother
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
to
sacrifice
himself
in
*NL*
a
marriage
he
did
not
want
would
be
degrading
,
and
would
undo
all
his
*NL*
life
,
make
it
a
nullity
.
He
would
try
what
he
COULD
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
had
a
great
tenderness
for
Miriam
.
Always
,
she
was
sad
,
dreaming
*NL*
her
religion
;
and
he
was
nearly
a
religion
to
her
.
He
could
not
bear
to
*NL*
fail
her
.
It
would
all
come
right
if
they
tried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
.
A
good
many
of
the
nicest
men
he
knew
were
like
*NL*
himself
,
bound
in
by
their
own
virginity
,
which
they
could
not
break
*NL*
out
of
.
They
were
so
sensitive
to
their
women
that
they
would
go
without
*NL*
them
for
ever
rather
than
do
them
a
hurt
,
an
injustice
.
Being
the
sons
*NL*
of
mothers
whose
husbands
had
blundered
rather
brutally
through
their
*NL*
feminine
sanctities
,
they
were
themselves
too
diffident
and
shy
.
They
*NL*
could
easier
deny
themselves
than
incur
any
reproach
from
a
woman
;
for
*NL*
a
woman
was
like
their
mother
,
and
they
were
full
of
the
sense
of
their
*NL*
mother
.
They
preferred
themselves
to
suffer
the
misery
of
celibacy
,
*NL*
rather
than
risk
the
other
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
to
her
.
Something
in
her
,
when
he
looked
at
her
,
brought
*NL*
the
tears
almost
to
his
eyes
.
One
day
he
stood
behind
her
as
she
sang
.
*NL*
Annie
was
playing
a
song
on
the
piano
.
As
Miriam
sang
her
mouth
seemed
*NL*
hopeless
.
She
sang
like
a
nun
singing
to
heaven
.
It
reminded
him
so
much
*NL*
of
the
mouth
and
eyes
of
one
who
sings
beside
a
Botticelli
Madonna
,
so
*NL*
spiritual
.
Again
,
hot
as
steel
,
came
up
the
pain
in
him
.
Why
must
he
ask
*NL*
her
for
the
other
thing
?
Why
was
there
his
blood
battling
with
her
?
If
*NL*
only
he
could
have
been
always
gentle
,
tender
with
her
,
breathing
with
*NL*
her
the
atmosphere
of
reverie
and
religious
dreams
,
he
would
give
*NL*
his
right
hand
.
It
was
not
fair
to
hurt
her
.
There
seemed
an
eternal
*NL*
maidenhood
about
her
;
and
when
he
thought
of
her
mother
,
he
saw
the
*NL*
great
brown
eyes
of
a
maiden
who
was
nearly
scared
and
shocked
out
of
*NL*
her
virgin
maidenhood
,
but
not
quite
,
in
spite
of
her
seven
children
.
*NL*
They
had
been
born
almost
leaving
her
out
of
count
,
not
of
her
,
but
upon
*NL*
her
.
So
she
could
never
let
them
go
,
because
she
never
had
possessed
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
saw
him
going
again
frequently
to
Miriam
,
and
was
astonished
.
*NL*
He
said
nothing
to
his
mother
.
He
did
not
explain
nor
excuse
himself
.
If
*NL*
he
came
home
late
,
and
she
reproached
him
,
he
frowned
and
turned
on
her
*NL*
in
an
overbearing
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
home
when
I
like
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
am
old
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
she
keep
you
till
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
who
stay
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
lets
you
?
But
very
well
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
went
to
bed
,
leaving
the
door
unlocked
for
him
;
but
she
lay
*NL*
listening
until
he
came
,
often
long
after
.
It
was
a
great
bitterness
*NL*
to
her
that
he
had
gone
back
to
Miriam
.
She
recognised
,
however
,
the
*NL*
uselessness
of
any
further
interference
.
He
went
to
Willey
Farm
as
a
*NL*
man
now
,
not
as
a
youth
.
She
had
no
right
over
him
.
There
was
a
coldness
*NL*
between
him
and
her
.
He
hardly
told
her
anything
.
Discarded
,
she
waited
*NL*
on
him
,
cooked
for
him
still
,
and
loved
to
slave
for
him
;
but
her
face
*NL*
closed
again
like
a
mask
.
There
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
now
but
the
*NL*
housework
;
for
all
the
rest
he
had
gone
to
Miriam
.
She
could
not
forgive
*NL*
him
.
Miriam
killed
the
joy
and
the
warmth
in
him
.
He
had
been
such
a
*NL*
jolly
lad
,
and
full
of
the
warmest
affection
;
now
he
grew
colder
,
more
*NL*
and
more
irritable
and
gloomy
.
It
reminded
her
of
William
;
but
Paul
was
*NL*
worse
.
He
did
things
with
more
intensity
,
and
more
realisation
of
what
*NL*
he
was
about
.
His
mother
knew
how
he
was
suffering
for
want
of
a
woman
,
*NL*
and
she
saw
him
going
to
Miriam
.
If
he
had
made
up
his
mind
,
nothing
*NL*
on
earth
would
alter
him
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
tired
.
She
began
to
give
up
at
*NL*
last
;
she
had
finished
.
She
was
in
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
determinedly
.
He
realised
more
or
less
what
his
mother
felt
.
*NL*
It
only
hardened
his
soul
.
He
made
himself
callous
towards
her
;
but
it
*NL*
was
like
being
callous
to
his
own
health
.
It
undermined
him
quickly
;
yet
*NL*
he
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
back
in
the
rocking-chair
at
Willey
Farm
one
evening
.
He
had
been
*NL*
talking
to
Miriam
for
some
weeks
,
but
had
not
come
to
the
point
.
Now
he
*NL*
said
suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
twenty-four
,
almost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
brooding
.
She
looked
up
at
him
suddenly
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
What
makes
you
say
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
in
the
charged
atmosphere
that
she
dreaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Thomas
More
says
one
can
marry
at
twenty-four
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
quaintly
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
need
Sir
Thomas
More
's
sanction
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
one
ought
to
marry
about
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
she
answered
broodingly
;
and
she
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
marry
you
,
''
he
continued
slowly
,
``
not
now
,
because
we
've
no
*NL*
money
,
and
they
depend
on
me
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
half-guessing
what
was
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
want
to
marry
now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
marry
?
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
--
you
know
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
at
last
,
I
must
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
ashamed
of
it
,
''
he
answered
.
``
You
would
n't
be
ashamed
*NL*
before
your
God
,
why
are
you
before
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
she
answered
deeply
,
``
I
am
not
ashamed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
,
''
he
replied
bitterly
;
``
and
it
's
my
fault
.
But
you
know
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
being
--
as
I
am
--
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
ca
n't
help
it
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
an
awful
lot
--
then
there
is
something
short
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
she
answered
,
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
in
me
!
It
is
I
who
ought
to
be
ashamed
--
like
a
spiritual
cripple
.
*NL*
And
I
am
ashamed
.
It
is
misery
.
Why
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
replied
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
Do
n't
you
think
we
have
been
too
*NL*
fierce
in
our
what
they
call
purity
?
Do
n't
you
think
that
to
be
so
much
*NL*
afraid
and
averse
is
a
sort
of
dirtiness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
with
startled
dark
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
recoiled
away
from
anything
of
the
sort
,
and
I
took
the
motion
from
*NL*
you
,
and
recoiled
also
,
perhaps
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
in
the
room
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
``
it
is
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
between
us
,
''
he
said
,
``
all
these
years
of
intimacy
.
I
feel
*NL*
naked
enough
before
you
.
Do
you
understand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
bitter
,
''
he
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
and
was
sorry
for
him
;
his
eyes
were
dark
with
*NL*
torture
.
She
was
sorry
for
him
;
it
was
worse
for
him
to
have
this
*NL*
deflated
love
than
for
herself
,
who
could
never
be
properly
mated
.
He
*NL*
was
restless
,
for
ever
urging
forward
and
trying
to
find
a
way
out
.
He
*NL*
might
do
as
he
liked
,
and
have
what
he
liked
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
she
said
softly
,
``
I
am
not
bitter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
she
could
bear
anything
for
him
;
she
would
suffer
for
him
.
She
*NL*
put
her
hand
on
his
knee
as
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
.
He
took
*NL*
it
and
kissed
it
;
but
it
hurt
to
do
so
.
He
felt
he
was
putting
himself
*NL*
aside
.
He
sat
there
sacrificed
to
her
purity
,
which
felt
more
like
*NL*
nullity
.
How
could
he
kiss
her
hand
passionately
,
when
it
would
drive
*NL*
her
away
,
and
leave
nothing
but
pain
?
Yet
slowly
he
drew
her
to
him
and
*NL*
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
knew
each
other
too
well
to
pretend
anything
.
As
she
kissed
him
,
*NL*
she
watched
his
eyes
;
they
were
staring
across
the
room
,
with
a
peculiar
*NL*
dark
blaze
in
them
that
fascinated
her
.
He
was
perfectly
still
.
She
*NL*
could
feel
his
heart
throbbing
heavily
in
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
about
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blaze
in
his
eyes
shuddered
,
became
uncertain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
,
all
the
while
,
I
love
you
.
I
have
been
obstinate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sank
her
head
on
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
,
''
he
said
,
and
his
voice
seemed
sure
,
and
his
mouth
was
*NL*
kissing
her
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
into
his
eyes
with
her
full
gaze
of
*NL*
love
.
The
blaze
struggled
,
seemed
to
try
to
get
away
from
her
,
and
*NL*
then
was
quenched
.
He
turned
his
head
quickly
aside
.
It
was
a
moment
of
*NL*
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kiss
me
,
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shut
his
eyes
,
and
kissed
her
,
and
his
arms
folded
her
closer
and
*NL*
closer
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
walked
home
with
him
over
the
fields
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
I
came
back
to
you
.
I
feel
so
simple
with
you
--
as
if
there
*NL*
was
nothing
to
hide
.
We
will
be
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
murmured
,
and
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
sort
of
perversity
in
our
souls
,
''
he
said
,
``
makes
us
not
want
,
get
*NL*
away
from
,
the
very
thing
we
want
.
We
have
to
fight
against
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
and
she
felt
stunned
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
stood
under
the
drooping-thorn
tree
,
in
the
darkness
by
the
*NL*
roadside
,
he
kissed
her
,
and
his
fingers
wandered
over
her
face
.
In
*NL*
the
darkness
,
where
he
could
not
see
her
but
only
feel
her
,
his
passion
*NL*
flooded
him
.
He
clasped
her
very
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometime
you
will
have
me
?
''
he
murmured
,
hiding
his
face
on
her
*NL*
shoulder
.
It
was
so
difficult
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
now
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hopes
and
his
heart
sunk
.
A
dreariness
came
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
clasp
of
her
slackened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
to
feel
your
arm
THERE
!
''
she
said
,
pressing
his
arm
against
her
*NL*
back
,
where
it
went
round
her
waist
.
``
It
rests
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tightened
the
pressure
of
his
arm
upon
the
small
of
her
back
to
rest
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
belong
to
each
other
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
should
n't
we
belong
to
each
other
altogether
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
''
she
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
's
a
lot
to
ask
,
''
he
said
;
``
but
there
's
not
much
risk
for
you
*NL*
really
--
not
in
the
Gretchen
way
.
You
can
trust
me
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
can
trust
you
.
''
The
answer
came
quick
and
strong
.
``
It
's
not
*NL*
that
--
it
's
not
that
at
all
--
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hid
her
face
in
his
neck
with
a
little
cry
of
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
slightly
hysterical
,
but
with
a
sort
of
horror
.
His
heart
*NL*
died
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
think
it
ugly
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
now
.
You
have
TAUGHT
me
it
is
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
calmed
herself
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
am
only
afraid
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
should
please
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
gripped
his
arms
round
her
,
and
clenched
her
body
stiff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
SHALL
have
me
,
''
she
said
,
through
her
shut
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
beat
up
again
like
fire
.
He
folded
her
close
,
and
his
mouth
*NL*
was
on
her
throat
.
She
could
not
bear
it
.
She
drew
away
.
He
disengaged
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
be
late
?
''
she
asked
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
,
scarcely
hearing
what
she
said
.
She
waited
,
wishing
he
would
*NL*
go
.
At
last
he
kissed
her
quickly
and
climbed
the
fence
.
Looking
round
*NL*
he
saw
the
pale
blotch
of
her
face
down
in
the
darkness
under
the
*NL*
hanging
tree
.
There
was
no
more
of
her
but
this
pale
blotch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
!
''
she
called
softly
.
She
had
no
body
,
only
a
voice
and
a
dim
*NL*
face
.
He
turned
away
and
ran
down
the
road
,
his
fists
clenched
;
and
*NL*
when
he
came
to
the
wall
over
the
lake
he
leaned
there
,
almost
stunned
,
*NL*
looking
up
the
black
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
plunged
home
over
the
meadows
.
She
was
not
afraid
of
people
,
what
*NL*
they
might
say
;
but
she
dreaded
the
issue
with
him
.
Yes
,
she
would
*NL*
let
him
have
her
if
he
insisted
;
and
then
,
when
she
thought
of
it
*NL*
afterwards
,
her
heart
went
down
.
He
would
be
disappointed
,
he
would
find
*NL*
no
satisfaction
,
and
then
he
would
go
away
.
Yet
he
was
so
insistent
;
and
*NL*
over
this
,
which
did
not
seem
so
all-important
to
her
,
was
their
love
*NL*
to
break
down
.
After
all
,
he
was
only
like
other
men
,
seeking
his
*NL*
satisfaction
.
Oh
,
but
there
was
something
more
in
him
,
something
deeper
!
*NL*
She
could
trust
to
it
,
in
spite
of
all
desires
.
He
said
that
possession
*NL*
was
a
great
moment
in
life
.
All
strong
emotions
concentrated
there
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
so
.
There
was
something
divine
in
it
;
then
she
would
*NL*
submit
,
religiously
,
to
the
sacrifice
.
He
should
have
her
.
And
at
*NL*
the
thought
her
whole
body
clenched
itself
involuntarily
,
hard
,
as
if
*NL*
against
something
;
but
Life
forced
her
through
this
gate
of
suffering
,
*NL*
too
,
and
she
would
submit
.
At
any
rate
,
it
would
give
him
what
he
*NL*
wanted
,
which
was
her
deepest
wish
.
She
brooded
and
brooded
and
brooded
*NL*
herself
towards
accepting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
courted
her
now
like
a
lover
.
Often
,
when
he
grew
hot
,
she
put
his
*NL*
face
from
her
,
held
it
between
her
hands
,
and
looked
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
He
could
not
meet
her
gaze
.
Her
dark
eyes
,
full
of
love
,
earnest
and
*NL*
searching
,
made
him
turn
away
.
Not
for
an
instant
would
she
let
him
*NL*
forget
.
Back
again
he
had
to
torture
himself
into
a
sense
of
his
*NL*
responsibility
and
hers
.
Never
any
relaxing
,
never
any
leaving
himself
*NL*
to
the
great
hunger
and
impersonality
of
passion
;
he
must
be
brought
*NL*
back
to
a
deliberate
,
reflective
creature
.
As
if
from
a
swoon
of
passion
*NL*
she
caged
him
back
to
the
littleness
,
the
personal
relationship
.
He
*NL*
could
not
bear
it
.
``
Leave
me
alone
--
leave
me
alone
!
''
he
wanted
to
cry
;
*NL*
but
she
wanted
him
to
look
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
love
.
His
eyes
,
full
*NL*
of
the
dark
,
impersonal
fire
of
desire
,
did
not
belong
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
great
crop
of
cherries
at
the
farm
.
The
trees
at
the
back
*NL*
of
the
house
,
very
large
and
tall
,
hung
thick
with
scarlet
and
crimson
*NL*
drops
,
under
the
dark
leaves
.
Paul
and
Edgar
were
gathering
the
fruit
*NL*
one
evening
.
It
had
been
a
hot
day
,
and
now
the
clouds
were
rolling
in
*NL*
the
sky
,
dark
and
warm
.
Paul
combed
high
in
the
tree
,
above
the
scarlet
*NL*
roofs
of
the
buildings
.
The
wind
,
moaning
steadily
,
made
the
whole
tree
*NL*
rock
with
a
subtle
,
thrilling
motion
that
stirred
the
blood
.
The
young
*NL*
man
,
perched
insecurely
in
the
slender
branches
,
rocked
till
he
felt
*NL*
slightly
drunk
,
reached
down
the
boughs
,
where
the
scarlet
beady
*NL*
cherries
hung
thick
underneath
,
and
tore
off
handful
after
handful
of
*NL*
the
sleek
,
cool-fleshed
fruit
.
Cherries
touched
his
ears
and
his
neck
as
*NL*
he
stretched
forward
,
their
chill
finger-tips
sending
a
flash
down
his
*NL*
blood
.
All
shades
of
red
,
from
a
golden
vermilion
to
a
rich
crimson
,
*NL*
glowed
and
met
his
eyes
under
a
darkness
of
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
,
going
down
,
suddenly
caught
the
broken
clouds
.
Immense
piles
of
*NL*
gold
flared
out
in
the
south-east
,
heaped
in
soft
,
glowing
yellow
right
*NL*
up
the
sky
.
The
world
,
till
now
dusk
and
grey
,
reflected
the
gold
glow
,
*NL*
astonished
.
Everywhere
the
trees
,
and
the
grass
,
and
the
far-off
water
,
*NL*
seemed
roused
from
the
twilight
and
shining
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
came
out
wondering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
Paul
heard
her
mellow
voice
call
,
``
is
n't
it
wonderful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
down
.
There
was
a
faint
gold
glimmer
on
her
face
,
that
looked
*NL*
very
soft
,
turned
up
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
high
you
are
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
her
,
on
the
rhubarb
leaves
,
were
four
dead
birds
,
thieves
that
*NL*
had
been
shot
.
Paul
saw
some
cherry
stones
hanging
quite
bleached
,
like
*NL*
skeletons
,
picked
clear
of
flesh
.
He
looked
down
again
to
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clouds
are
on
fire
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beautiful
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
so
small
,
so
soft
,
so
tender
,
down
there
.
He
threw
a
handful
*NL*
of
cherries
at
her
.
She
was
startled
and
frightened
.
He
laughed
with
a
*NL*
low
,
chuckling
sound
,
and
pelted
her
.
She
ran
for
shelter
,
picking
*NL*
up
some
cherries
.
Two
fine
red
pairs
she
hung
over
her
ears
;
then
she
*NL*
looked
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't
you
got
enough
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
.
It
is
like
being
on
a
ship
up
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
long
will
you
stay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
the
sunset
lasts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
the
fence
and
sat
there
,
watching
the
gold
clouds
fall
to
*NL*
pieces
,
and
go
in
immense
,
rose-coloured
ruin
towards
the
darkness
.
Gold
*NL*
flamed
to
scarlet
,
like
pain
in
its
intense
brightness
.
Then
the
scarlet
*NL*
sank
to
rose
,
and
rose
to
crimson
,
and
quickly
the
passion
went
out
of
*NL*
the
sky
.
All
the
world
was
dark
grey
.
Paul
scrambled
quickly
down
with
*NL*
his
basket
,
tearing
his
shirt-sleeve
as
he
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
lovely
,
''
said
Miriam
,
fingering
the
cherries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
torn
my
sleeve
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
the
three-cornered
rip
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
to
mend
it
.
''
It
was
near
the
shoulder
.
She
put
her
fingers
*NL*
through
the
tear
.
``
How
warm
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
.
There
was
a
new
,
strange
note
in
his
voice
,
one
that
made
*NL*
her
pant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
stay
out
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
it
rain
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
let
us
walk
a
little
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
down
the
fields
and
into
the
thick
plantation
of
trees
and
*NL*
pines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
in
among
the
trees
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
dark
among
the
firs
,
and
the
sharp
spines
pricked
her
face
.
*NL*
She
was
afraid
.
Paul
was
silent
and
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
the
darkness
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
wish
it
were
thicker
--
good
,
thick
*NL*
darkness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
almost
unaware
of
her
as
a
person
:
she
was
only
to
him
*NL*
then
a
woman
.
She
was
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
against
a
pine-tree
trunk
and
took
her
in
his
arms
.
She
*NL*
relinquished
herself
to
him
,
but
it
was
a
sacrifice
in
which
she
felt
*NL*
something
of
horror
.
This
thick-voiced
,
oblivious
man
was
a
stranger
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
it
began
to
rain
.
The
pine-trees
smelled
very
strong
.
Paul
lay
*NL*
with
his
head
on
the
ground
,
on
the
dead
pine
needles
,
listening
to
the
*NL*
sharp
hiss
of
the
rain
--
a
steady
,
keen
noise
.
His
heart
was
down
,
very
*NL*
heavy
.
Now
he
realised
that
she
had
not
been
with
him
all
the
time
,
*NL*
that
her
soul
had
stood
apart
,
in
a
sort
of
horror
.
He
was
physically
at
*NL*
rest
,
but
no
more
.
Very
dreary
at
heart
,
very
sad
,
and
very
tender
,
*NL*
his
fingers
wandered
over
her
face
pitifully
.
Now
again
she
loved
him
*NL*
deeply
.
He
was
tender
and
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rain
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
is
it
coming
on
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hands
over
him
,
on
his
hair
,
on
his
shoulders
,
to
feel
if
*NL*
the
raindrops
fell
on
him
.
She
loved
him
dearly
.
He
,
as
he
lay
with
his
*NL*
face
on
the
dead
pine-leaves
,
felt
extraordinarily
quiet
.
He
did
not
*NL*
mind
if
the
raindrops
came
on
him
:
he
would
have
lain
and
got
wet
*NL*
through
:
he
felt
as
if
nothing
mattered
,
as
if
his
living
were
smeared
*NL*
away
into
the
beyond
,
near
and
quite
lovable
.
This
strange
,
gentle
*NL*
reaching-out
to
death
was
new
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
go
,
''
said
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
answered
,
but
did
not
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
him
now
,
life
seemed
a
shadow
,
day
a
white
shadow
;
night
,
and
death
,
*NL*
and
stillness
,
and
inaction
,
this
seemed
like
BEING
.
To
be
alive
,
to
be
*NL*
urgent
and
insistent
--
that
was
NOT-TO-BE
.
The
highest
of
all
was
to
melt
*NL*
out
into
the
darkness
and
sway
there
,
identified
with
the
great
Being
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rain
is
coming
in
on
us
,
''
said
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
,
and
assisted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pity
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
have
to
go
.
I
feel
so
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
!
''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stiller
than
I
have
ever
been
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
walking
with
his
hand
in
hers
.
She
pressed
his
fingers
,
feeling
*NL*
a
slight
fear
.
Now
he
seemed
beyond
her
;
she
had
a
fear
lest
she
should
*NL*
lose
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fir-trees
are
like
presences
on
the
darkness
:
each
one
only
a
*NL*
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
afraid
,
and
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sort
of
hush
:
the
whole
night
wondering
and
asleep
:
I
suppose
that
's
*NL*
what
we
do
in
death
--
sleep
in
wonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
afraid
before
of
the
brute
in
him
:
now
of
the
mystic
.
She
*NL*
trod
beside
him
in
silence
.
The
rain
fell
with
a
heavy
``
Hush
!
''
on
the
*NL*
trees
.
At
last
they
gained
the
cartshed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
stay
here
awhile
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sound
of
rain
everywhere
,
smothering
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
so
strange
and
still
,
''
he
said
;
``
along
with
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
she
answered
patiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
again
unaware
of
her
,
though
he
held
her
hand
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
rid
of
our
individuality
,
which
is
our
will
,
which
is
our
*NL*
effort
--
to
live
effortless
,
a
kind
of
curious
sleep
--
that
is
very
*NL*
beautiful
,
I
think
;
that
is
our
after-life
--
our
immortality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
and
very
beautiful
to
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
usually
say
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
while
they
went
indoors
.
Everybody
looked
at
them
curiously
.
He
*NL*
still
kept
the
quiet
,
heavy
look
in
his
eyes
,
the
stillness
in
his
*NL*
voice
.
Instinctively
,
they
all
left
him
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
Miriam
's
grandmother
,
who
lived
in
a
tiny
cottage
in
*NL*
Woodlinton
,
fell
ill
,
and
the
girl
was
sent
to
keep
house
.
It
was
a
*NL*
beautiful
little
place
.
The
cottage
had
a
big
garden
in
front
,
with
*NL*
red
brick
walls
,
against
which
the
plum
trees
were
nailed
.
At
the
back
*NL*
another
garden
was
separated
from
the
fields
by
a
tall
old
hedge
.
It
*NL*
was
very
pretty
.
Miriam
had
not
much
to
do
,
so
she
found
time
for
her
*NL*
beloved
reading
,
and
for
writing
little
introspective
pieces
which
*NL*
interested
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
holiday-time
her
grandmother
,
being
better
,
was
driven
to
Derby
*NL*
to
stay
with
her
daughter
for
a
day
or
two
.
She
was
a
crotchety
old
*NL*
lady
,
and
might
return
the
second
day
or
the
third
;
so
Miriam
stayed
*NL*
alone
in
the
cottage
,
which
also
pleased
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
used
often
to
cycle
over
,
and
they
had
as
a
rule
peaceful
and
happy
*NL*
times
.
He
did
not
embarrass
her
much
;
but
then
on
the
Monday
of
the
*NL*
holiday
he
was
to
spend
a
whole
day
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
perfect
weather
.
He
left
his
mother
,
telling
her
where
he
was
*NL*
going
.
She
would
be
alone
all
the
day
.
It
cast
a
shadow
over
him
;
but
*NL*
he
had
three
days
that
were
all
his
own
,
when
he
was
going
to
do
as
he
*NL*
liked
.
It
was
sweet
to
rush
through
the
morning
lanes
on
his
bicycle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
to
the
cottage
at
about
eleven
o'clock
.
Miriam
was
busy
preparing
*NL*
dinner
.
She
looked
so
perfectly
in
keeping
with
the
little
kitchen
,
*NL*
ruddy
and
busy
.
He
kissed
her
and
sat
down
to
watch
.
The
room
was
small
*NL*
and
cosy
.
The
sofa
was
covered
all
over
with
a
sort
of
linen
in
squares
*NL*
of
red
and
pale
blue
,
old
,
much
washed
,
but
pretty
.
There
was
a
stuffed
*NL*
owl
in
a
case
over
a
corner
cupboard
.
The
sunlight
came
through
the
*NL*
leaves
of
the
scented
geraniums
in
the
window
.
She
was
cooking
a
chicken
*NL*
in
his
honour
.
It
was
their
cottage
for
the
day
,
and
they
were
man
and
*NL*
wife
.
He
beat
the
eggs
for
her
and
peeled
the
potatoes
.
He
thought
she
*NL*
gave
a
feeling
of
home
almost
like
his
mother
;
and
no
one
could
look
*NL*
more
beautiful
,
with
her
tumbled
curls
,
when
she
was
flushed
from
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner
was
a
great
success
.
Like
a
young
husband
,
he
carved
.
They
*NL*
talked
all
the
time
with
unflagging
zest
.
Then
he
wiped
the
dishes
she
*NL*
had
washed
,
and
they
went
out
down
the
fields
.
There
was
a
bright
little
*NL*
brook
that
ran
into
a
bog
at
the
foot
of
a
very
steep
bank
.
Here
*NL*
they
wandered
,
picking
still
a
few
marsh-marigolds
and
many
big
blue
*NL*
forget-me-nots
.
Then
she
sat
on
the
bank
with
her
hands
full
of
flowers
,
*NL*
mostly
golden
water-blobs
.
As
she
put
her
face
down
into
the
marigolds
,
*NL*
it
was
all
overcast
with
a
yellow
shine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
face
is
bright
,
''
he
said
,
``
like
a
transfiguration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
questioning
.
He
laughed
pleadingly
to
her
,
laying
his
*NL*
hands
on
hers
.
Then
he
kissed
her
fingers
,
then
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
world
was
all
steeped
in
sunshine
,
and
quite
still
,
yet
not
asleep
,
*NL*
but
quivering
with
a
kind
of
expectancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
seen
anything
more
beautiful
than
this
,
''
he
said
.
He
held
*NL*
her
hand
fast
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
water
singing
to
itself
as
it
runs
--
do
you
love
it
?
''
She
looked
*NL*
at
him
full
of
love
.
His
eyes
were
very
dark
,
very
bright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
a
great
day
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
murmured
her
assent
.
She
WAS
happy
,
and
he
saw
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
our
day
--
just
between
us
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
lingered
a
little
while
.
Then
they
stood
up
upon
the
sweet
thyme
,
*NL*
and
he
looked
down
at
her
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
come
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
back
to
the
house
,
hand
in
hand
,
in
silence
.
The
chickens
came
*NL*
scampering
down
the
path
to
her
.
He
locked
the
door
,
and
they
had
the
*NL*
little
house
to
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
forgot
seeing
her
as
she
lay
on
the
bed
,
when
he
was
*NL*
unfastening
his
collar
.
First
he
saw
only
her
beauty
,
and
was
blind
*NL*
with
it
.
She
had
the
most
beautiful
body
he
had
ever
imagined
.
He
stood
*NL*
unable
to
move
or
speak
,
looking
at
her
,
his
face
half-smiling
with
*NL*
wonder
.
And
then
he
wanted
her
,
but
as
he
went
forward
to
her
,
her
hands
*NL*
lifted
in
a
little
pleading
movement
,
and
he
looked
at
her
face
,
and
*NL*
stopped
.
Her
big
brown
eyes
were
watching
him
,
still
and
resigned
and
*NL*
loving
;
she
lay
as
if
she
had
given
herself
up
to
sacrifice
:
there
was
*NL*
her
body
for
him
;
but
the
look
at
the
back
of
her
eyes
,
like
a
creature
*NL*
awaiting
immolation
,
arrested
him
,
and
all
his
blood
fell
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
you
want
me
?
''
he
asked
,
as
if
a
cold
shadow
had
come
over
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
quite
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
quiet
,
very
calm
.
She
only
realised
that
she
was
doing
*NL*
something
for
him
.
He
could
hardly
bear
it
.
She
lay
to
be
sacrificed
for
*NL*
him
because
she
loved
him
so
much
.
And
he
had
to
sacrifice
her
.
For
a
*NL*
second
,
he
wished
he
were
sexless
or
dead
.
Then
he
shut
his
eyes
again
*NL*
to
her
,
and
his
blood
beat
back
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
afterwards
he
loved
her
--
loved
her
to
the
last
fibre
of
his
being
.
*NL*
He
loved
her
.
But
he
wanted
,
somehow
,
to
cry
.
There
was
something
he
*NL*
could
not
bear
for
her
sake
.
He
stayed
with
her
till
quite
late
at
*NL*
night
.
As
he
rode
home
he
felt
that
he
was
finally
initiated
.
He
was
a
*NL*
youth
no
longer
.
But
why
had
he
the
dull
pain
in
his
soul
?
Why
did
the
*NL*
thought
of
death
,
the
after-life
,
seem
so
sweet
and
consoling
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
spent
the
week
with
Miriam
,
and
wore
her
out
with
his
passion
before
*NL*
it
was
gone
.
He
had
always
,
almost
wilfully
,
to
put
her
out
of
count
,
*NL*
and
act
from
the
brute
strength
of
his
own
feelings
.
And
he
could
not
do
*NL*
it
often
,
and
there
remained
afterwards
always
the
sense
of
failure
and
*NL*
of
death
.
If
he
were
really
with
her
,
he
had
to
put
aside
himself
and
*NL*
his
desire
.
If
he
would
have
her
,
he
had
to
put
her
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
come
to
you
,
''
he
asked
her
,
his
eyes
dark
with
pain
and
shame
,
*NL*
``
you
do
n't
really
want
me
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
''
she
replied
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
she
said
,
taking
his
face
and
shutting
it
out
against
her
*NL*
shoulder
--
``
you
see
--
as
we
are
--
how
can
I
get
used
to
you
?
It
would
come
*NL*
all
right
if
we
were
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
her
head
,
and
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
,
now
,
it
is
always
too
much
shock
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
always
clenched
against
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
trembling
with
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
'm
not
used
to
the
thought
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
lately
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
all
my
life
.
Mother
said
to
me
:
`
There
is
one
thing
in
marriage
*NL*
that
is
always
dreadful
,
but
you
have
to
bear
it
.
'
And
I
believed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
still
believe
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
she
cried
hastily
.
``
I
believe
,
as
you
do
,
that
loving
,
even
in
*NL*
THAT
way
,
is
the
high-water
mark
of
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
does
n't
alter
the
fact
that
you
never
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
taking
his
head
in
her
arms
and
rocking
in
despair
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
so
!
You
do
n't
understand
.
''
She
rocked
with
pain
.
``
Do
n't
I
*NL*
want
your
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
say
so
?
But
we
must
be
married
to
have
children
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
be
married
,
then
?
I
want
you
to
have
my
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
hand
reverently
.
She
pondered
sadly
,
watching
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
too
young
,
''
she
said
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-four
and
twenty-three
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
''
she
pleaded
,
as
she
rocked
herself
in
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
will
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bowed
her
head
gravely
.
The
tone
of
hopelessness
in
which
he
said
*NL*
these
things
grieved
her
deeply
.
It
had
always
been
a
failure
between
*NL*
them
.
Tacitly
,
she
acquiesced
in
what
he
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
a
week
of
love
he
said
to
his
mother
suddenly
one
Sunday
*NL*
night
,
just
as
they
were
going
to
bed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
go
so
much
to
Miriam
's
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
surprised
,
but
she
would
not
ask
him
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
please
yourself
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
went
to
bed
.
But
there
was
a
new
quietness
about
him
which
she
*NL*
had
wondered
at
.
She
almost
guessed
.
She
would
leave
him
alone
,
however
.
*NL*
Precipitation
might
spoil
things
.
She
watched
him
in
his
loneliness
,
*NL*
wondering
where
he
would
end
.
He
was
sick
,
and
much
too
quiet
for
him
.
*NL*
There
was
a
perpetual
little
knitting
of
his
brows
,
such
as
she
had
seen
*NL*
when
he
was
a
small
baby
,
and
which
had
been
gone
for
many
years
.
Now
*NL*
it
was
the
same
again
.
And
she
could
do
nothing
for
him
.
He
had
to
go
on
*NL*
alone
,
make
his
own
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
faithful
to
Miriam
.
For
one
day
he
had
loved
her
utterly
.
*NL*
But
it
never
came
again
.
The
sense
of
failure
grew
stronger
.
At
first
it
*NL*
was
only
a
sadness
.
Then
he
began
to
feel
he
could
not
go
on
.
He
wanted
*NL*
to
run
,
to
go
abroad
,
anything
.
Gradually
he
ceased
to
ask
her
to
have
*NL*
him
.
Instead
of
drawing
them
together
,
it
put
them
apart
.
And
then
he
*NL*
realised
,
consciously
,
that
it
was
no
good
.
It
was
useless
trying
:
it
*NL*
would
never
be
a
success
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
months
he
had
seen
very
little
of
Clara
.
They
had
occasionally
*NL*
walked
out
for
half
an
hour
at
dinner-time
.
But
he
always
reserved
*NL*
himself
for
Miriam
.
With
Clara
,
however
,
his
brow
cleared
,
and
he
*NL*
was
gay
again
.
She
treated
him
indulgently
,
as
if
he
were
a
child
.
He
*NL*
thought
he
did
not
mind
.
But
deep
below
the
surface
it
piqued
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
Miriam
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
Clara
?
I
hear
nothing
of
her
lately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
walked
with
her
about
twenty
minutes
yesterday
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
she
talk
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
suppose
I
did
all
the
jawing
--
I
usually
do
.
I
think
I
*NL*
was
telling
her
about
the
strike
,
and
how
the
women
took
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
gave
the
account
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
insidiously
,
without
his
knowing
it
,
the
warmth
he
felt
for
Clara
*NL*
drew
him
away
from
Miriam
,
for
whom
he
felt
responsible
,
and
to
whom
he
*NL*
felt
he
belonged
.
He
thought
he
was
being
quite
faithful
to
her
.
It
was
*NL*
not
easy
to
estimate
exactly
the
strength
and
warmth
of
one
's
feelings
*NL*
for
a
woman
till
they
have
run
away
with
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
give
more
time
to
his
men
friends
.
There
was
Jessop
,
at
the
*NL*
art
school
;
Swain
,
who
was
chemistry
demonstrator
at
the
university
;
*NL*
Newton
,
who
was
a
teacher
;
besides
Edgar
and
Miriam
's
younger
brothers
.
*NL*
Pleading
work
,
he
sketched
and
studied
with
Jessop
.
He
called
in
the
*NL*
university
for
Swain
,
and
the
two
went
``
down
town
''
together
.
Having
come
*NL*
home
in
the
train
with
Newton
,
he
called
and
had
a
game
of
billiards
*NL*
with
him
in
the
Moon
and
Stars
.
If
he
gave
to
Miriam
the
excuse
of
his
*NL*
men
friends
,
he
felt
quite
justified
.
His
mother
began
to
be
relieved
.
*NL*
He
always
told
her
where
he
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
summer
Clara
wore
sometimes
a
dress
of
soft
cotton
stuff
with
*NL*
loose
sleeves
.
When
she
lifted
her
hands
,
her
sleeves
fell
back
,
and
her
*NL*
beautiful
strong
arms
shone
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
a
minute
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Hold
your
arm
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
sketches
of
her
hand
and
arm
,
and
the
drawings
contained
some
*NL*
of
the
fascination
the
real
thing
had
for
him
.
Miriam
,
who
always
went
*NL*
scrupulously
through
his
books
and
papers
,
saw
the
drawings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
Clara
has
such
beautiful
arms
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
When
did
you
draw
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
Tuesday
,
in
the
work-room
.
You
know
,
I
've
got
a
corner
where
I
can
*NL*
work
.
Often
I
can
do
every
single
thing
they
need
in
the
department
,
*NL*
before
dinner
.
Then
I
work
for
myself
in
the
afternoon
,
and
just
see
to
*NL*
things
at
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
turning
the
leaves
of
his
sketch-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frequently
he
hated
Miriam
.
He
hated
her
as
she
bent
forward
and
pored
*NL*
over
his
things
.
He
hated
her
way
of
patiently
casting
him
up
,
as
if
he
*NL*
were
an
endless
psychological
account
.
When
he
was
with
her
,
he
hated
*NL*
her
for
having
got
him
,
and
yet
not
got
him
,
and
he
tortured
her
.
She
*NL*
took
all
and
gave
nothing
,
he
said
.
At
least
,
she
gave
no
living
warmth
.
*NL*
She
was
never
alive
,
and
giving
off
life
.
Looking
for
her
was
like
*NL*
looking
for
something
which
did
not
exist
.
She
was
only
his
conscience
,
*NL*
not
his
mate
.
He
hated
her
violently
,
and
was
more
cruel
to
her
.
They
*NL*
dragged
on
till
the
next
summer
.
He
saw
more
and
more
of
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
spoke
.
He
had
been
sitting
working
at
home
one
evening
.
There
*NL*
was
between
him
and
his
mother
a
peculiar
condition
of
people
frankly
*NL*
finding
fault
with
each
other
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
strong
on
her
feet
again
.
*NL*
He
was
not
going
to
stick
to
Miriam
.
Very
well
;
then
she
would
stand
*NL*
aloof
till
he
said
something
.
It
had
been
coming
a
long
time
,
this
*NL*
bursting
of
the
storm
in
him
,
when
he
would
come
back
to
her
.
This
*NL*
evening
there
was
between
them
a
peculiar
condition
of
suspense
.
*NL*
He
worked
feverishly
and
mechanically
,
so
that
he
could
escape
from
*NL*
himself
.
It
grew
late
.
Through
the
open
door
,
stealthily
,
came
the
scent
*NL*
of
madonna
lilies
,
almost
as
if
it
were
prowling
abroad
.
Suddenly
he
got
*NL*
up
and
went
out
of
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beauty
of
the
night
made
him
want
to
shout
.
A
half-moon
,
dusky
gold
,
*NL*
was
sinking
behind
the
black
sycamore
at
the
end
of
the
garden
,
making
*NL*
the
sky
dull
purple
with
its
glow
.
Nearer
,
a
dim
white
fence
of
lilies
*NL*
went
across
the
garden
,
and
the
air
all
round
seemed
to
stir
with
scent
,
*NL*
as
if
it
were
alive
.
He
went
across
the
bed
of
pinks
,
whose
keen
perfume
*NL*
came
sharply
across
the
rocking
,
heavy
scent
of
the
lilies
,
and
stood
*NL*
alongside
the
white
barrier
of
flowers
.
They
flagged
all
loose
,
as
if
*NL*
they
were
panting
.
The
scent
made
him
drunk
.
He
went
down
to
the
field
*NL*
to
watch
the
moon
sink
under
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
corncrake
in
the
hay-close
called
insistently
.
The
moon
slid
quite
*NL*
quickly
downwards
,
growing
more
flushed
.
Behind
him
the
great
flowers
*NL*
leaned
as
if
they
were
calling
.
And
then
,
like
a
shock
,
he
caught
*NL*
another
perfume
,
something
raw
and
coarse
.
Hunting
round
,
he
found
*NL*
the
purple
iris
,
touched
their
fleshy
throats
and
their
dark
,
grasping
*NL*
hands
.
At
any
rate
,
he
had
found
something
.
They
stood
stiff
in
the
*NL*
darkness
.
Their
scent
was
brutal
.
The
moon
was
melting
down
upon
the
*NL*
crest
of
the
hill
.
It
was
gone
;
all
was
dark
.
The
corncrake
called
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Breaking
off
a
pink
,
he
suddenly
went
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
boy
,
''
said
his
mother
.
``
I
'm
sure
it
's
time
you
went
to
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
with
the
pink
against
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
break
off
with
Miriam
,
mother
,
''
he
answered
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
at
him
over
her
spectacles
.
He
was
staring
back
at
her
,
*NL*
unswerving
.
She
met
his
eyes
for
a
moment
,
then
took
off
her
glasses
.
He
*NL*
was
white
.
The
male
was
up
in
him
,
dominant
.
She
did
not
want
to
see
him
*NL*
too
clearly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
--
''
she
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
answered
,
``
I
do
n't
love
her
.
I
do
n't
want
to
marry
her
--
so
I
*NL*
shall
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
exclaimed
his
mother
,
amazed
,
``
I
thought
lately
you
had
made
up
*NL*
your
mind
to
have
her
,
and
so
I
said
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
--
I
wanted
to
--
but
now
I
do
n't
want
.
It
's
no
good
.
I
shall
break
*NL*
off
on
Sunday
.
I
ought
to
,
ought
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
best
.
You
know
I
said
so
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
that
now
.
I
shall
break
off
on
Sunday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
his
mother
,
``
I
think
it
will
be
best
.
But
lately
I
decided
*NL*
you
had
made
up
your
mind
to
have
her
,
so
I
said
nothing
,
and
should
*NL*
have
said
nothing
.
But
I
say
as
I
have
always
said
,
I
DO
N'T
think
she
is
*NL*
suited
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
Sunday
I
break
off
,
''
he
said
,
smelling
the
pink
.
He
put
the
flower
*NL*
in
his
mouth
.
Unthinking
,
he
bared
his
teeth
,
closed
them
on
the
blossom
*NL*
slowly
,
and
had
a
mouthful
of
petals
.
These
he
spat
into
the
fire
,
*NL*
kissed
his
mother
,
and
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Sunday
he
went
up
to
the
farm
in
the
early
afternoon
.
He
had
written
*NL*
Miriam
that
they
would
walk
over
the
fields
to
Hucknall
.
His
mother
was
*NL*
very
tender
with
him
.
He
said
nothing
.
But
she
saw
the
effort
it
was
*NL*
costing
.
The
peculiar
set
look
on
his
face
stilled
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
my
son
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
will
be
so
much
better
when
it
is
*NL*
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
glanced
swiftly
at
his
mother
in
surprise
and
resentment
.
He
did
*NL*
not
want
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
met
him
at
the
lane-end
.
She
was
wearing
a
new
dress
of
figured
*NL*
muslin
that
had
short
sleeves
.
Those
short
sleeves
,
and
Miriam
's
*NL*
brown-skinned
arms
beneath
them
--
such
pitiful
,
resigned
arms
--
gave
him
*NL*
so
much
pain
that
they
helped
to
make
him
cruel
.
She
had
made
herself
*NL*
look
so
beautiful
and
fresh
for
him
.
She
seemed
to
blossom
for
him
*NL*
alone
.
Every
time
he
looked
at
her
--
a
mature
young
woman
now
,
and
*NL*
beautiful
in
her
new
dress
--
it
hurt
so
much
that
his
heart
seemed
almost
*NL*
to
be
bursting
with
the
restraint
he
put
on
it
.
But
he
had
decided
,
and
*NL*
it
was
irrevocable
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
hills
they
sat
down
,
and
he
lay
with
his
head
in
her
lap
,
whilst
*NL*
she
fingered
his
hair
.
She
knew
that
``
he
was
not
there
,
''
as
she
put
it
.
*NL*
Often
,
when
she
had
him
with
her
,
she
looked
for
him
,
and
could
not
find
*NL*
him
.
But
this
afternoon
she
was
not
prepared
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
five
o'clock
when
he
told
her
.
They
were
sitting
on
the
*NL*
bank
of
a
stream
,
where
the
lip
of
turf
hung
over
a
hollow
bank
of
*NL*
yellow
earth
,
and
he
was
hacking
away
with
a
stick
,
as
he
did
when
he
*NL*
was
perturbed
and
cruel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
thinking
,
''
he
said
,
``
we
ought
to
break
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
she
cried
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
's
no
good
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
it
no
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
.
I
do
n't
want
to
marry
.
I
do
n't
want
ever
to
marry
.
And
if
*NL*
we
're
not
going
to
marry
,
it
's
no
good
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
do
you
say
this
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
've
made
up
my
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
about
these
last
months
,
and
the
things
you
told
me
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
!
I
do
n't
want
to
go
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
want
any
more
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
us
to
break
off
--
you
be
free
of
me
,
I
free
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
about
these
last
months
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
've
not
told
you
anything
but
what
I
thought
was
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
are
you
different
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
--
I
'm
the
same
--
only
I
know
it
's
no
good
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
told
me
why
it
's
no
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
want
to
go
on
--
and
I
do
n't
want
to
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
times
have
you
offered
to
marry
me
,
and
I
would
n't
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
;
but
I
want
us
to
break
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
,
while
he
dug
viciously
at
the
*NL*
earth
.
She
bent
her
head
,
pondering
.
He
was
an
unreasonable
child
.
He
*NL*
was
like
an
infant
which
,
when
it
has
drunk
its
fill
,
throws
away
and
*NL*
smashes
the
cup
.
She
looked
at
him
,
feeling
she
could
get
hold
of
him
*NL*
and
WRING
some
consistency
out
of
him
.
But
she
was
helpless
.
Then
she
*NL*
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
said
you
were
only
fourteen
--
you
are
only
FOUR
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
dug
at
the
earth
viciously
.
He
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
child
of
four
,
''
she
repeated
in
her
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
,
but
said
in
his
heart
:
``
All
right
;
if
I
'm
a
child
of
*NL*
four
,
what
do
you
want
me
for
?
I
do
n't
want
another
mother
.
''
But
he
said
*NL*
nothing
to
her
,
and
there
was
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
told
your
people
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
my
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
long
interval
of
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
what
do
you
WANT
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
want
us
to
separate
.
We
have
lived
on
each
other
all
these
*NL*
years
;
now
let
us
stop
.
I
will
go
my
own
way
without
you
,
and
you
will
*NL*
go
your
way
without
me
.
You
will
have
an
independent
life
of
your
own
*NL*
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
in
it
some
truth
that
,
in
spite
of
her
bitterness
,
she
could
*NL*
not
help
registering
.
She
knew
she
felt
in
a
sort
of
bondage
to
him
,
*NL*
which
she
hated
because
she
could
not
control
it
.
She
hated
her
love
for
*NL*
him
from
the
moment
it
grew
too
strong
for
her
.
And
,
deep
down
,
she
had
*NL*
hated
him
because
she
loved
him
and
he
dominated
her
.
She
had
resisted
*NL*
his
domination
.
She
had
fought
to
keep
herself
free
of
him
in
the
last
*NL*
issue
.
And
she
was
free
of
him
,
even
more
than
he
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
''
he
continued
,
``
we
shall
always
be
more
or
less
each
other
's
work
.
*NL*
You
have
done
a
lot
for
me
,
I
for
you
.
Now
let
us
start
and
live
by
*NL*
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
to
do
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
--
only
to
be
free
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
however
,
knew
in
her
heart
that
Clara
's
influence
was
over
him
to
*NL*
liberate
him
.
But
she
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
have
I
to
tell
my
mother
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
my
mother
,
''
he
answered
,
``
that
I
was
breaking
off
--
clean
and
*NL*
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
tell
them
at
home
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frowning
,
``
You
please
yourself
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
he
had
landed
her
in
a
nasty
hole
,
and
was
leaving
her
in
the
*NL*
lurch
.
It
angered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
them
you
would
n't
and
wo
n't
marry
me
,
and
have
broken
off
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
It
's
true
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bit
her
finger
moodily
.
She
thought
over
their
whole
affair
.
She
had
*NL*
known
it
would
come
to
this
;
she
had
seen
it
all
along
.
It
chimed
with
*NL*
her
bitter
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
--
it
has
always
been
so
!
''
she
cried
.
``
It
has
been
one
long
battle
*NL*
between
us
--
you
fighting
away
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
from
her
unawares
,
like
a
flash
of
lightning
.
The
man
's
heart
*NL*
stood
still
.
Was
this
how
she
saw
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
've
had
SOME
perfect
hours
,
SOME
perfect
times
,
when
we
were
*NL*
together
!
''
he
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
''
she
cried
;
``
never
!
It
has
always
been
you
fighting
me
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
always
--
not
at
first
!
''
he
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
,
from
the
very
beginning
--
always
the
same
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
finished
,
but
she
had
done
enough
.
He
sat
aghast
.
He
had
wanted
*NL*
to
say
:
``
It
has
been
good
,
but
it
is
at
an
end
.
''
And
she
--
she
whose
love
*NL*
he
had
believed
in
when
he
had
despised
himself
--
denied
that
their
love
*NL*
had
ever
been
love
.
``
He
had
always
fought
away
from
her
?
''
Then
it
had
*NL*
been
monstrous
.
There
had
never
been
anything
really
between
them
;
all
*NL*
the
time
he
had
been
imagining
something
where
there
was
nothing
.
And
*NL*
she
had
known
.
She
had
known
so
much
,
and
had
told
him
so
little
.
She
*NL*
had
known
all
the
time
.
All
the
time
this
was
at
the
bottom
of
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
silent
in
bitterness
.
At
last
the
whole
affair
appeared
in
a
*NL*
cynical
aspect
to
him
.
She
had
really
played
with
him
,
not
he
with
her
.
*NL*
She
had
hidden
all
her
condemnation
from
him
,
had
flattered
him
,
and
*NL*
despised
him
.
She
despised
him
now
.
He
grew
intellectual
and
cruel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
marry
a
man
who
worships
you
,
''
he
said
;
``
then
you
could
do
*NL*
as
you
liked
with
him
.
Plenty
of
men
will
worship
you
,
if
you
get
on
the
*NL*
private
side
of
their
natures
.
You
ought
to
marry
one
such
.
They
would
*NL*
never
fight
you
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
''
she
said
.
``
But
do
n't
advise
me
to
marry
someone
else
any
*NL*
more
.
You
've
done
it
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
will
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
still
,
feeling
as
if
he
had
had
a
blow
,
instead
of
giving
one
.
*NL*
Their
eight
years
of
friendship
and
love
,
THE
eight
years
of
his
life
,
*NL*
were
nullified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
think
of
this
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
definitely
on
Thursday
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
it
was
coming
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
pleased
him
bitterly
.
``
Oh
,
very
well
!
If
she
knew
then
it
does
n't
*NL*
come
as
a
surprise
to
her
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
said
anything
to
Clara
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
I
shall
tell
her
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
the
things
you
said
this
time
last
year
,
in
my
*NL*
grandmother
's
house
--
nay
last
month
even
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
;
``
I
do
!
And
I
meant
them
!
I
ca
n't
help
that
it
's
failed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
failed
because
you
want
something
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
failed
whether
or
not
.
YOU
never
believed
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
strangely
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
in
silence
.
He
was
full
of
a
feeling
that
she
had
deceived
him
.
*NL*
She
had
despised
him
when
he
thought
she
worshipped
him
.
She
had
let
him
*NL*
say
wrong
things
,
and
had
not
contradicted
him
.
She
had
let
him
fight
*NL*
alone
.
But
it
stuck
in
his
throat
that
she
had
despised
him
whilst
he
*NL*
thought
she
worshipped
him
.
She
should
have
told
him
when
she
found
*NL*
fault
with
him
.
She
had
not
played
fair
.
He
hated
her
.
All
these
years
*NL*
she
had
treated
him
as
if
he
were
a
hero
,
and
thought
of
him
secretly
as
*NL*
an
infant
,
a
foolish
child
.
Then
why
had
she
left
the
foolish
child
to
*NL*
his
folly
?
His
heart
was
hard
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
full
of
bitterness
.
She
had
known
--
oh
,
well
she
had
known
!
*NL*
All
the
time
he
was
away
from
her
she
had
summed
him
up
,
seen
his
*NL*
littleness
,
his
meanness
,
and
his
folly
.
Even
she
had
guarded
her
soul
*NL*
against
him
.
She
was
not
overthrown
,
not
prostrated
,
not
even
much
hurt
.
*NL*
She
had
known
.
Only
why
,
as
he
sat
there
,
had
he
still
this
strange
*NL*
dominance
over
her
?
His
very
movements
fascinated
her
as
if
she
were
*NL*
hypnotised
by
him
.
Yet
he
was
despicable
,
false
,
inconsistent
,
and
mean
.
*NL*
Why
this
bondage
for
her
?
Why
was
it
the
movement
of
his
arm
stirred
her
*NL*
as
nothing
else
in
the
world
could
?
Why
was
she
fastened
to
him
?
Why
,
*NL*
even
now
,
if
he
looked
at
her
and
commanded
her
,
would
she
have
to
obey
?
*NL*
She
would
obey
him
in
his
trifling
commands
.
But
once
he
was
obeyed
,
*NL*
then
she
had
him
in
her
power
,
she
knew
,
to
lead
him
where
she
would
.
*NL*
She
was
sure
of
herself
.
Only
,
this
new
influence
!
Ah
,
he
was
not
a
man
!
*NL*
He
was
a
baby
that
cries
for
the
newest
toy
.
And
all
the
attachment
*NL*
of
his
soul
would
not
keep
him
.
Very
well
,
he
would
have
to
go
.
But
he
*NL*
would
come
back
when
he
had
tired
of
his
new
sensation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hacked
at
the
earth
till
she
was
fretted
to
death
.
She
rose
.
He
sat
*NL*
flinging
lumps
of
earth
in
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
go
and
have
tea
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
chattered
over
irrelevant
subjects
during
tea
.
He
held
forth
on
*NL*
the
love
of
ornament
--
the
cottage
parlour
moved
him
thereto
--
and
its
*NL*
connection
with
aesthetics
.
She
was
cold
and
quiet
.
As
they
walked
home
,
*NL*
she
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
we
shall
not
see
each
other
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
or
rarely
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
write
?
''
she
asked
,
almost
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
will
,
''
he
answered
.
``
We
're
not
strangers
--
never
should
be
,
*NL*
whatever
happened
.
I
will
write
to
you
now
and
again
.
You
please
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
!
''
she
answered
cuttingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
at
that
stage
at
which
nothing
else
hurts
.
He
had
made
a
*NL*
great
cleavage
in
his
life
.
He
had
had
a
great
shock
when
she
had
told
*NL*
him
their
love
had
been
always
a
conflict
.
Nothing
more
mattered
.
If
it
*NL*
never
had
been
much
,
there
was
no
need
to
make
a
fuss
that
it
was
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
her
at
the
lane-end
.
As
she
went
home
,
solitary
,
in
her
new
*NL*
frock
,
having
her
people
to
face
at
the
other
end
,
he
stood
still
with
*NL*
shame
and
pain
in
the
highroad
,
thinking
of
the
suffering
he
caused
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
reaction
towards
restoring
his
self-esteem
,
he
went
into
the
*NL*
Willow
Tree
for
a
drink
.
There
were
four
girls
who
had
been
out
for
the
*NL*
day
,
drinking
a
modest
glass
of
port
.
They
had
some
chocolates
on
the
*NL*
table
.
Paul
sat
near
with
his
whisky
.
He
noticed
the
girls
whispering
*NL*
and
nudging
.
Presently
one
,
a
bonny
dark
hussy
,
leaned
to
him
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
a
chocolate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
laughed
loudly
at
her
impudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
Give
me
a
hard
one
--
nut
.
I
do
n't
like
creams
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
then
,
''
said
the
girl
;
``
here
's
an
almond
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
the
sweet
between
her
fingers
.
He
opened
his
mouth
.
She
popped
*NL*
it
in
,
and
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ARE
nice
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
answered
,
``
we
thought
you
looked
overcast
,
and
they
dared
me
*NL*
offer
you
a
chocolate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
if
I
have
another
--
another
sort
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
presently
they
were
all
laughing
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nine
o'clock
when
he
got
home
,
falling
dark
.
He
entered
the
house
*NL*
in
silence
.
His
mother
,
who
had
been
waiting
,
rose
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
her
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
,
''
replied
the
mother
,
with
great
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hung
up
his
cap
wearily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
we
'd
have
done
altogether
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
my
son
,
''
said
the
mother
.
``
It
's
hard
for
her
now
,
but
*NL*
best
in
the
long
run
.
I
know
.
You
were
n't
suited
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
shakily
as
he
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
such
a
lark
with
some
girls
in
a
pub
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
looked
at
him
.
He
had
forgotten
Miriam
now
.
He
told
her
*NL*
about
the
girls
in
the
Willow
Tree
.
Mrs.
Morel
looked
at
him
.
It
seemed
*NL*
unreal
,
his
gaiety
.
At
the
back
of
it
was
too
much
horror
and
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
have
some
supper
,
''
she
said
very
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
he
said
wistfully
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
thought
she
'd
have
me
,
mother
,
not
from
the
first
,
and
so
*NL*
she
's
not
disappointed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
,
''
said
his
mother
,
``
she
does
n't
give
up
hopes
of
you
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
,
``
perhaps
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
find
it
's
better
to
have
done
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
he
said
desperately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
leave
her
alone
,
''
replied
his
mother
.
So
he
left
her
,
and
she
was
*NL*
alone
.
Very
few
people
cared
for
her
,
and
she
for
very
few
people
.
She
*NL*
remained
alone
with
herself
,
waiting
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
PASSION
*NL*
*NL*
HE
was
gradually
making
it
possible
to
earn
a
livelihood
by
his
art
.
*NL*
Liberty
's
had
taken
several
of
his
painted
designs
on
various
stuffs
,
*NL*
and
he
could
sell
designs
for
embroideries
,
for
altar-cloths
,
and
*NL*
similar
things
,
in
one
or
two
places
.
It
was
not
very
much
he
made
*NL*
at
present
,
but
he
might
extend
it
.
He
had
also
made
friends
with
the
*NL*
designer
for
a
pottery
firm
,
and
was
gaining
some
knowledge
of
his
new
*NL*
acquaintance
's
art
.
The
applied
arts
interested
him
very
much
.
At
the
*NL*
same
time
he
laboured
slowly
at
his
pictures
.
He
loved
to
paint
large
*NL*
figures
,
full
of
light
,
but
not
merely
made
up
of
lights
and
cast
*NL*
shadows
,
like
the
impressionists
;
rather
definite
figures
that
had
a
*NL*
certain
luminous
quality
,
like
some
of
Michael
Angelo
's
people
.
And
*NL*
these
he
fitted
into
a
landscape
,
in
what
he
thought
true
proportion
.
*NL*
He
worked
a
great
deal
from
memory
,
using
everybody
he
knew
.
He
believed
*NL*
firmly
in
his
work
,
that
it
was
good
and
valuable
.
In
spite
of
fits
of
*NL*
depression
,
shrinking
,
everything
,
he
believed
in
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
twenty-four
when
he
said
his
first
confident
thing
to
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
s
'll
make
a
painter
that
they
'll
attend
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sniffed
in
her
quaint
fashion
.
It
was
like
a
half-pleased
shrug
of
*NL*
the
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
my
boy
,
we
'll
see
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
see
,
my
pigeon
!
You
see
if
you
're
not
swanky
one
of
these
*NL*
days
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
quite
content
,
my
boy
,
''
she
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
have
to
alter
.
Look
at
you
with
Minnie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Minnie
was
the
small
servant
,
a
girl
of
fourteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
about
Minnie
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Morel
,
with
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
her
this
morning
:
`
Eh
,
Mrs.
Morel
!
I
was
going
to
do
that
,
'
*NL*
when
you
went
out
in
the
rain
for
some
coal
,
''
he
said
.
``
That
looks
a
lot
*NL*
like
your
being
able
to
manage
servants
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
only
the
child
's
niceness
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
apologising
to
her
:
`
You
ca
n't
do
two
things
at
once
,
can
*NL*
you
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
WAS
busy
washing
up
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
she
say
?
`
It
could
easy
have
waited
a
bit
.
Now
look
how
*NL*
your
feet
paddle
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
brazen
young
baggage
!
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
his
mother
,
laughing
.
She
was
quite
warm
and
rosy
again
*NL*
with
love
of
him
.
It
seemed
as
if
all
the
sunshine
were
on
her
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
He
continued
his
work
gladly
.
She
seemed
so
well
when
she
was
*NL*
happy
that
he
forgot
her
grey
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
year
she
went
with
him
to
the
Isle
of
Wight
for
a
holiday
.
It
*NL*
was
too
exciting
for
them
both
,
and
too
beautiful
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
full
*NL*
of
joy
and
wonder
.
But
he
would
have
her
walk
with
him
more
than
she
*NL*
was
able
.
She
had
a
bad
fainting
bout
.
So
grey
her
face
was
,
so
blue
her
*NL*
mouth
!
It
was
agony
to
him
.
He
felt
as
if
someone
were
pushing
a
knife
*NL*
in
his
chest
.
Then
she
was
better
again
,
and
he
forgot
.
But
the
anxiety
*NL*
remained
inside
him
,
like
a
wound
that
did
not
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
leaving
Miriam
he
went
almost
straight
to
Clara
.
On
the
Monday
*NL*
following
the
day
of
the
rupture
he
went
down
to
the
work-room
.
She
*NL*
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
.
They
had
grown
very
intimate
unawares
.
She
*NL*
saw
a
new
brightness
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Queen
of
Sheba
!
''
he
said
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
suits
you
.
You
've
got
a
new
frock
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
,
asking
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suits
you
--
awfully
!
I
could
design
you
a
dress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
would
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
in
front
of
her
,
his
eyes
glittering
as
he
expounded
.
He
*NL*
kept
her
eyes
fixed
with
his
.
Then
suddenly
he
took
hold
of
her
.
She
*NL*
half-started
back
.
He
drew
the
stuff
of
her
blouse
tighter
,
smoothed
it
*NL*
over
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
SO
!
''
he
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
they
were
both
of
them
flaming
with
blushes
,
and
immediately
he
*NL*
ran
away
.
He
had
touched
her
.
His
whole
body
was
quivering
with
the
*NL*
sensation
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
already
a
sort
of
secret
understanding
between
them
.
The
next
*NL*
evening
he
went
to
the
cinematograph
with
her
for
a
few
minutes
before
*NL*
train-time
.
As
they
sat
,
he
saw
her
hand
lying
near
him
.
For
some
*NL*
moments
he
dared
not
touch
it
.
The
pictures
danced
and
dithered
.
Then
*NL*
he
took
her
hand
in
his
.
It
was
large
and
firm
;
it
filled
his
grasp
.
He
*NL*
held
it
fast
.
She
neither
moved
nor
made
any
sign
.
When
they
came
out
*NL*
his
train
was
due
.
He
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
she
said
.
He
darted
away
across
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
he
came
again
,
talking
to
her
.
She
was
rather
superior
with
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
a
walk
on
Monday
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
face
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
you
tell
Miriam
?
''
she
replied
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
broken
off
with
her
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Last
Sunday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
quarrelled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
I
had
made
up
my
mind
.
I
told
her
quite
definitely
I
should
*NL*
consider
myself
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
did
not
answer
,
and
he
returned
to
his
work
.
She
was
so
quiet
and
*NL*
so
superb
!
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Saturday
evening
he
asked
her
to
come
and
drink
coffee
with
him
*NL*
in
a
restaurant
,
meeting
him
after
work
was
over
.
She
came
,
looking
*NL*
very
reserved
and
very
distant
.
He
had
three-quarters
of
an
hour
to
*NL*
train-time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
walk
a
little
while
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
agreed
,
and
they
went
past
the
Castle
into
the
Park
.
He
was
afraid
*NL*
of
her
.
She
walked
moodily
at
his
side
,
with
a
kind
of
resentful
,
*NL*
reluctant
,
angry
walk
.
He
was
afraid
to
take
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
way
shall
we
go
?
''
he
asked
as
they
walked
in
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
'll
go
up
the
steps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
turned
round
.
They
had
passed
the
Park
steps
.
She
stood
*NL*
still
in
resentment
at
his
suddenly
abandoning
her
.
He
looked
for
her
.
*NL*
She
stood
aloof
.
He
caught
her
suddenly
in
his
arms
,
held
her
strained
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
kissed
her
.
Then
he
let
her
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
''
he
said
,
penitent
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
him
.
He
took
her
hand
and
kissed
her
finger-tips
.
They
went
*NL*
in
silence
.
When
they
came
to
the
light
,
he
let
go
her
hand
.
Neither
*NL*
spoke
till
they
reached
the
station
.
Then
they
looked
each
other
in
the
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
for
his
train
.
His
body
acted
mechanically
.
People
talked
to
*NL*
him
.
He
heard
faint
echoes
answering
them
.
He
was
in
a
delirium
.
He
felt
*NL*
that
he
would
go
mad
if
Monday
did
not
come
at
once
.
On
Monday
he
would
*NL*
see
her
again
.
All
himself
was
pitched
there
,
ahead
.
Sunday
intervened
.
*NL*
He
could
not
bear
it
.
He
could
not
see
her
till
Monday
.
And
Sunday
*NL*
intervened
--
hour
after
hour
of
tension
.
He
wanted
to
beat
his
head
*NL*
against
the
door
of
the
carriage
.
But
he
sat
still
.
He
drank
some
whisky
*NL*
on
the
way
home
,
but
it
only
made
it
worse
.
His
mother
must
not
be
*NL*
upset
,
that
was
all
.
He
dissembled
,
and
got
quickly
to
bed
.
There
he
*NL*
sat
,
dressed
,
with
his
chin
on
his
knees
,
staring
out
of
the
window
at
*NL*
the
far
hill
,
with
its
few
lights
.
He
neither
thought
nor
slept
,
but
sat
*NL*
perfectly
still
,
staring
.
And
when
at
last
he
was
so
cold
that
he
came
*NL*
to
himself
,
he
found
his
watch
had
stopped
at
half-past
two
.
It
was
*NL*
after
three
o'clock
.
He
was
exhausted
,
but
still
there
was
the
torment
*NL*
of
knowing
it
was
only
Sunday
morning
.
He
went
to
bed
and
slept
.
Then
he
*NL*
cycled
all
day
long
,
till
he
was
fagged
out
.
And
he
scarcely
knew
where
*NL*
he
had
been
.
But
the
day
after
was
Monday
.
He
slept
till
four
o'clock
.
*NL*
Then
he
lay
and
thought
.
He
was
coming
nearer
to
himself
--
he
could
see
*NL*
himself
,
real
,
somewhere
in
front
.
She
would
go
a
walk
with
him
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
.
Afternoon
!
It
seemed
years
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
the
hours
crawled
.
His
father
got
up
;
he
heard
him
pottering
*NL*
about
.
Then
the
miner
set
off
to
the
pit
,
his
heavy
boots
scraping
the
*NL*
yard
.
Cocks
were
still
crowing
.
A
cart
went
down
the
road
.
His
mother
*NL*
got
up
.
She
knocked
the
fire
.
Presently
she
called
him
softly
.
He
*NL*
answered
as
if
he
were
asleep
.
This
shell
of
himself
did
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
walking
to
the
station
--
another
mile
!
The
train
was
near
*NL*
Nottingham
.
Would
it
stop
before
the
tunnels
?
But
it
did
not
matter
;
it
*NL*
would
get
there
before
dinner-time
.
He
was
at
Jordan
's
.
She
would
*NL*
come
in
half
an
hour
.
At
any
rate
,
she
would
be
near
.
He
had
done
*NL*
the
letters
.
She
would
be
there
.
Perhaps
she
had
not
come
.
He
ran
*NL*
downstairs
.
Ah
!
he
saw
her
through
the
glass
door
.
Her
shoulders
*NL*
stooping
a
little
to
her
work
made
him
feel
he
could
not
go
forward
;
he
*NL*
could
not
stand
.
He
went
in
.
He
was
pale
,
nervous
,
awkward
,
and
quite
*NL*
cold
.
Would
she
misunderstand
him
?
He
could
not
write
his
real
self
with
*NL*
this
shell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
afternoon
,
''
he
struggled
to
say
.
``
You
will
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
''
she
replied
,
murmuring
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
before
her
,
unable
to
say
a
word
.
She
hid
her
face
from
him
.
*NL*
Again
came
over
him
the
feeling
that
he
would
lose
consciousness
.
He
set
*NL*
his
teeth
and
went
upstairs
.
He
had
done
everything
correctly
yet
,
and
*NL*
he
would
do
so
.
All
the
morning
things
seemed
a
long
way
off
,
as
they
*NL*
do
to
a
man
under
chloroform
.
He
himself
seemed
under
a
tight
band
*NL*
of
constraint
.
Then
there
was
his
other
self
,
in
the
distance
,
doing
*NL*
things
,
entering
stuff
in
a
ledger
,
and
he
watched
that
far-off
him
*NL*
carefully
to
see
he
made
no
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
ache
and
strain
of
it
could
not
go
on
much
longer
.
He
worked
*NL*
incessantly
.
Still
it
was
only
twelve
o'clock
.
As
if
he
had
nailed
his
*NL*
clothing
against
the
desk
,
he
stood
there
and
worked
,
forcing
every
*NL*
stroke
out
of
himself
.
It
was
a
quarter
to
one
;
he
could
clear
away
.
*NL*
Then
he
ran
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
meet
me
at
the
Fountain
at
two
o'clock
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
be
there
till
half-past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
his
dark
,
mad
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
at
a
quarter
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
had
to
be
content
.
He
went
and
got
some
dinner
.
All
the
time
*NL*
he
was
still
under
chloroform
,
and
every
minute
was
stretched
out
*NL*
indefinitely
.
He
walked
miles
of
streets
.
Then
he
thought
he
would
be
*NL*
late
at
the
meeting-place
.
He
was
at
the
Fountain
at
five
past
two
.
The
*NL*
torture
of
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
was
refined
beyond
expression
.
It
*NL*
was
the
anguish
of
combining
the
living
self
with
the
shell
.
Then
he
saw
*NL*
her
.
She
came
!
And
he
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
late
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
five
minutes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
never
have
done
it
to
you
,
''
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
a
dark
blue
costume
.
He
looked
at
her
beautiful
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
some
flowers
,
''
he
said
,
going
to
the
nearest
florist
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
him
in
silence
.
He
bought
her
a
bunch
of
scarlet
,
brick-red
*NL*
carnations
.
She
put
them
in
her
coat
,
flushing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
fine
colour
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
have
had
something
softer
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
feel
like
a
blot
of
vermilion
walking
down
the
street
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hung
her
head
,
afraid
of
the
people
they
met
.
He
looked
sideways
at
*NL*
her
as
they
walked
.
There
was
a
wonderful
close
down
on
her
face
near
*NL*
the
ear
that
he
wanted
to
touch
.
And
a
certain
heaviness
,
the
heaviness
*NL*
of
a
very
full
ear
of
corn
that
dips
slightly
in
the
wind
,
that
there
*NL*
was
about
her
,
made
his
brain
spin
.
He
seemed
to
be
spinning
down
the
*NL*
street
,
everything
going
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
sat
in
the
tramcar
,
she
leaned
her
heavy
shoulder
against
him
,
*NL*
and
he
took
her
hand
.
He
felt
himself
coming
round
from
the
anaesthetic
,
*NL*
beginning
to
breathe
.
Her
ear
,
half-hidden
among
her
blonde
hair
,
was
*NL*
near
to
him
.
The
temptation
to
kiss
it
was
almost
too
great
.
But
there
*NL*
were
other
people
on
top
of
the
car
.
It
still
remained
to
him
to
kiss
*NL*
it
.
After
all
,
he
was
not
himself
,
he
was
some
attribute
of
hers
,
like
*NL*
the
sunshine
that
fell
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
quickly
away
.
It
had
been
raining
.
The
big
bluff
of
the
Castle
*NL*
rock
was
streaked
with
rain
,
as
it
reared
above
the
flat
of
the
town
.
*NL*
They
crossed
the
wide
,
black
space
of
the
Midland
Railway
,
and
passed
*NL*
the
cattle
enclosure
that
stood
out
white
.
Then
they
ran
down
sordid
*NL*
Wilford
Road
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rocked
slightly
to
the
tram
's
motion
,
and
as
she
leaned
against
*NL*
him
,
rocked
upon
him
.
He
was
a
vigorous
,
slender
man
,
with
exhaustless
*NL*
energy
.
His
face
was
rough
,
with
rough-hewn
features
,
like
the
common
*NL*
people
's
;
but
his
eyes
under
the
deep
brows
were
so
full
of
life
that
*NL*
they
fascinated
her
.
They
seemed
to
dance
,
and
yet
they
were
still
*NL*
trembling
on
the
finest
balance
of
laughter
.
His
mouth
the
same
was
just
*NL*
going
to
spring
into
a
laugh
of
triumph
,
yet
did
not
.
There
was
a
sharp
*NL*
suspense
about
him
.
She
bit
her
lip
moodily
.
His
hand
was
hard
clenched
*NL*
over
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
paid
their
two
halfpennies
at
the
turnstile
and
crossed
the
bridge
.
*NL*
The
Trent
was
very
full
.
It
swept
silent
and
insidious
under
the
bridge
,
*NL*
travelling
in
a
soft
body
.
There
had
been
a
great
deal
of
rain
.
On
the
*NL*
river
levels
were
flat
gleams
of
flood
water
.
The
sky
was
grey
,
with
*NL*
glisten
of
silver
here
and
there
.
In
Wilford
churchyard
the
dahlias
were
*NL*
sodden
with
rain
--
wet
black-crimson
balls
.
No
one
was
on
the
path
that
*NL*
went
along
the
green
river
meadow
,
along
the
elm-tree
colonnade
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
faintest
haze
over
the
silvery-dark
water
and
the
green
*NL*
meadow-bank
,
and
the
elm-trees
that
were
spangled
with
gold
.
The
river
*NL*
slid
by
in
a
body
,
utterly
silent
and
swift
,
intertwining
among
itself
*NL*
like
some
subtle
,
complex
creature
.
Clara
walked
moodily
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
she
asked
at
length
,
in
rather
a
jarring
tone
,
``
did
you
leave
*NL*
Miriam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
WANTED
to
leave
her
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
did
n't
want
to
go
on
with
her
.
And
I
did
n't
want
to
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
for
a
moment
.
They
picked
their
way
down
the
muddy
path
.
*NL*
Drops
of
water
fell
from
the
elm-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
want
to
marry
Miriam
,
or
you
did
n't
want
to
marry
at
all
?
''
*NL*
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
,
''
he
answered
--
``
both
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
to
manoeuvre
to
get
to
the
stile
,
because
of
the
pools
of
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
she
say
?
''
Clara
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miriam
?
She
said
I
was
a
baby
of
four
,
and
that
I
always
HAD
battled
*NL*
her
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
pondered
over
this
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
really
been
going
with
her
for
some
time
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
you
do
n't
want
any
more
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
know
it
's
no
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pondered
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
you
've
treated
her
rather
badly
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
ought
to
have
dropped
it
years
back
.
But
it
would
have
been
no
*NL*
good
going
on
.
Two
wrongs
do
n't
make
a
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
ARE
you
?
''
Clara
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
thirty
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
thirty-one
--
or
AM
I
thirty-one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
neither
know
nor
care
.
What
does
it
matter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
at
the
entrance
to
the
Grove
.
The
wet
,
red
track
,
already
*NL*
sticky
with
fallen
leaves
,
went
up
the
steep
bank
between
the
grass
.
*NL*
On
either
side
stood
the
elm-trees
like
pillars
along
a
great
aisle
,
*NL*
arching
over
and
making
high
up
a
roof
from
which
the
dead
leaves
fell
.
*NL*
All
was
empty
and
silent
and
wet
.
She
stood
on
top
of
the
stile
,
and
he
*NL*
held
both
her
hands
.
Laughing
,
she
looked
down
into
his
eyes
.
Then
she
*NL*
leaped
.
Her
breast
came
against
his
;
he
held
her
,
and
covered
her
face
*NL*
with
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
on
up
the
slippery
,
steep
red
path
.
Presently
she
released
his
*NL*
hand
and
put
it
round
her
waist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
press
the
vein
in
my
arm
,
holding
it
so
tightly
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
along
.
His
finger-tips
felt
the
rocking
of
her
breast
.
All
*NL*
was
silent
and
deserted
.
On
the
left
the
red
wet
plough-land
showed
*NL*
through
the
doorways
between
the
elm-boles
and
their
branches
.
On
the
*NL*
right
,
looking
down
,
they
could
see
the
tree-tops
of
elms
growing
far
*NL*
beneath
them
,
hear
occasionally
the
gurgle
of
the
river
.
Sometimes
*NL*
there
below
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
full
,
soft-sliding
Trent
,
and
of
*NL*
water-meadows
dotted
with
small
cattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
scarcely
altered
since
little
Kirke
White
used
to
come
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
watching
her
throat
below
the
ear
,
where
the
flush
was
*NL*
fusing
into
the
honey-white
,
and
her
mouth
that
pouted
disconsolate
.
She
*NL*
stirred
against
him
as
she
walked
,
and
his
body
was
like
a
taut
string
.
*NL*
*NL*
Halfway
up
the
big
colonnade
of
elms
,
where
the
Grove
rose
highest
above
*NL*
the
river
,
their
forward
movement
faltered
to
an
end
.
He
led
her
across
*NL*
to
the
grass
,
under
the
trees
at
the
edge
of
the
path
.
The
cliff
of
red
*NL*
earth
sloped
swiftly
down
,
through
trees
and
bushes
,
to
the
river
that
*NL*
glimmered
and
was
dark
between
the
foliage
.
The
far-below
water-meadows
*NL*
were
very
green
.
He
and
she
stood
leaning
against
one
another
,
silent
,
*NL*
afraid
,
their
bodies
touching
all
along
.
There
came
a
quick
gurgle
from
*NL*
the
river
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
he
asked
at
length
,
``
did
you
hate
Baxter
Dawes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
him
with
a
splendid
movement
.
Her
mouth
was
offered
him
,
*NL*
and
her
throat
;
her
eyes
were
half-shut
;
her
breast
was
tilted
as
if
it
*NL*
asked
for
him
.
He
flashed
with
a
small
laugh
,
shut
his
eyes
,
and
met
*NL*
her
in
a
long
,
whole
kiss
.
Her
mouth
fused
with
his
;
their
bodies
were
*NL*
sealed
and
annealed
.
It
was
some
minutes
before
they
withdrew
.
They
were
*NL*
standing
beside
the
public
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
go
down
to
the
river
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
leaving
herself
in
his
hands
.
He
went
over
the
brim
*NL*
of
the
declivity
and
began
to
climb
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
slippery
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
red
clay
went
down
almost
sheer
.
He
slid
,
went
from
one
tuft
*NL*
of
grass
to
the
next
,
hanging
on
to
the
bushes
,
making
for
a
little
*NL*
platform
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
.
There
he
waited
for
her
,
laughing
with
*NL*
excitement
.
Her
shoes
were
clogged
with
red
earth
.
It
was
hard
for
her
.
*NL*
He
frowned
.
At
last
he
caught
her
hand
,
and
she
stood
beside
him
.
The
*NL*
cliff
rose
above
them
and
fell
away
below
.
Her
colour
was
up
,
her
eyes
*NL*
flashed
.
He
looked
at
the
big
drop
below
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
risky
,
''
he
said
;
``
or
messy
,
at
any
rate
.
Shall
we
go
back
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
my
sake
,
''
she
said
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
You
see
,
I
ca
n't
help
you
;
I
should
only
hinder
.
Give
me
*NL*
that
little
parcel
and
your
gloves
.
Your
poor
shoes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
perched
on
the
face
of
the
declivity
,
under
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
go
again
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Away
he
went
,
slipping
,
staggering
,
sliding
to
the
next
tree
,
into
which
*NL*
he
fell
with
a
slam
that
nearly
shook
the
breath
out
of
him
.
She
*NL*
came
after
cautiously
,
hanging
on
to
the
twigs
and
grasses
.
So
they
*NL*
descended
,
stage
by
stage
,
to
the
river
's
brink
.
There
,
to
his
disgust
,
*NL*
the
flood
had
eaten
away
the
path
,
and
the
red
decline
ran
straight
into
*NL*
the
water
.
He
dug
in
his
heels
and
brought
himself
up
violently
.
The
*NL*
string
of
the
parcel
broke
with
a
snap
;
the
brown
parcel
bounded
down
,
*NL*
leaped
into
the
water
,
and
sailed
smoothly
away
.
He
hung
on
to
his
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
be
damned
!
''
he
cried
crossly
.
Then
he
laughed
.
She
was
*NL*
coming
perilously
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mind
!
''
he
warned
her
.
He
stood
with
his
back
to
the
tree
,
waiting
.
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
''
he
called
,
opening
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
let
herself
run
.
He
caught
her
,
and
together
they
stood
watching
the
*NL*
dark
water
scoop
at
the
raw
edge
of
the
bank
.
The
parcel
had
sailed
out
*NL*
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
matter
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
her
close
and
kissed
her
.
There
was
only
room
for
their
four
*NL*
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
swindle
!
''
he
said
.
``
But
there
's
a
rut
where
a
man
has
been
,
so
*NL*
if
we
go
on
I
guess
we
shall
find
the
path
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
river
slid
and
twined
its
great
volume
.
On
the
other
bank
cattle
*NL*
were
feeding
on
the
desolate
flats
.
The
cliff
rose
high
above
Paul
and
*NL*
Clara
on
their
right
hand
.
They
stood
against
the
tree
in
the
watery
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
try
going
forward
,
''
he
said
;
and
they
struggled
in
the
red
*NL*
clay
along
the
groove
a
man
's
nailed
boots
had
made
.
They
were
hot
and
*NL*
flushed
.
Their
barkled
shoes
hung
heavy
on
their
steps
.
At
last
they
*NL*
found
the
broken
path
.
It
was
littered
with
rubble
from
the
water
,
but
*NL*
at
any
rate
it
was
easier
.
They
cleaned
their
boots
with
twigs
.
His
*NL*
heart
was
beating
thick
and
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
coming
on
to
the
little
level
,
he
saw
two
figures
of
men
*NL*
standing
silent
at
the
water
's
edge
.
His
heart
leaped
.
They
were
*NL*
fishing
.
He
turned
and
put
his
hand
up
warningly
to
Clara
.
She
*NL*
hesitated
,
buttoned
her
coat
.
The
two
went
on
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fishermen
turned
curiously
to
watch
the
two
intruders
on
their
*NL*
privacy
and
solitude
.
They
had
had
a
fire
,
but
it
was
nearly
out
.
All
*NL*
kept
perfectly
still
.
The
men
turned
again
to
their
fishing
,
stood
*NL*
over
the
grey
glinting
river
like
statues
.
Clara
went
with
bowed
head
,
*NL*
flushing
;
he
was
laughing
to
himself
.
Directly
they
passed
out
of
sight
*NL*
behind
the
willows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
they
ought
to
be
drowned
,
''
said
Paul
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
did
not
answer
.
They
toiled
forward
along
a
tiny
path
on
the
*NL*
river
's
lip
.
Suddenly
it
vanished
.
The
bank
was
sheer
red
solid
clay
*NL*
in
front
of
them
,
sloping
straight
into
the
river
.
He
stood
and
cursed
*NL*
beneath
his
breath
,
setting
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
impossible
!
''
said
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
erect
,
looking
round
.
Just
ahead
were
two
islets
in
the
stream
,
*NL*
covered
with
osiers
.
But
they
were
unattainable
.
The
cliff
came
down
*NL*
like
a
sloping
wall
from
far
above
their
heads
.
Behind
,
not
far
back
,
*NL*
were
the
fishermen
.
Across
the
river
the
distant
cattle
fed
silently
*NL*
in
the
desolate
afternoon
.
He
cursed
again
deeply
under
his
breath
.
He
*NL*
gazed
up
the
great
steep
bank
.
Was
there
no
hope
but
to
scale
back
to
*NL*
the
public
path
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
a
minute
,
''
he
said
,
and
,
digging
his
heels
sideways
into
the
steep
*NL*
bank
of
red
clay
,
he
began
nimbly
to
mount
.
He
looked
across
at
every
*NL*
tree-foot
.
At
last
he
found
what
he
wanted
.
Two
beech-trees
side
by
side
*NL*
on
the
hill
held
a
little
level
on
the
upper
face
between
their
roots
.
*NL*
It
was
littered
with
damp
leaves
,
but
it
would
do
.
The
fishermen
were
*NL*
perhaps
sufficiently
out
of
sight
.
He
threw
down
his
rainproof
and
waved
*NL*
to
her
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
toiled
to
his
side
.
Arriving
there
,
she
looked
at
him
heavily
,
*NL*
dumbly
,
and
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
.
He
held
her
fast
as
he
looked
*NL*
round
.
They
were
safe
enough
from
all
but
the
small
,
lonely
cows
over
*NL*
the
river
.
He
sunk
his
mouth
on
her
throat
,
where
he
felt
her
heavy
*NL*
pulse
beat
under
his
lips
.
Everything
was
perfectly
still
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
in
the
afternoon
but
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
arose
,
he
,
looking
on
the
ground
all
the
time
,
saw
suddenly
*NL*
sprinkled
on
the
black
wet
beech-roots
many
scarlet
carnation
petals
,
*NL*
like
splashed
drops
of
blood
;
and
red
,
small
splashes
fell
from
her
*NL*
bosom
,
streaming
down
her
dress
to
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
flowers
are
smashed
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
heavily
as
she
put
back
her
hair
.
Suddenly
he
put
his
*NL*
finger-tips
on
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
dost
look
so
heavy
?
''
he
reproached
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
sadly
,
as
if
she
felt
alone
in
herself
.
He
caressed
her
cheek
*NL*
with
his
fingers
,
and
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
!
''
he
said
.
``
Never
thee
bother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gripped
his
fingers
tight
,
and
laughed
shakily
.
Then
she
dropped
her
*NL*
hand
.
He
put
the
hair
back
from
her
brows
,
stroking
her
temples
,
kissing
*NL*
them
lightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tha
shouldna
worrit
!
''
he
said
softly
,
pleading
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
worry
!
''
she
laughed
tenderly
and
resigned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yea
,
tha
does
!
Dunna
thee
worrit
,
''
he
implored
,
caressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
she
consoled
him
,
kissing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
a
stiff
climb
to
get
to
the
top
again
.
It
took
them
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
.
When
he
got
on
to
the
level
grass
,
he
threw
off
his
cap
,
*NL*
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
,
and
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
're
back
at
the
ordinary
level
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
,
panting
,
on
the
tussocky
grass
.
Her
cheeks
were
flushed
*NL*
pink
.
He
kissed
her
,
and
she
gave
way
to
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
I
'll
clean
thy
boots
and
make
thee
fit
for
respectable
folk
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kneeled
at
her
feet
,
worked
away
with
a
stick
and
tufts
of
grass
.
She
*NL*
put
her
fingers
in
his
hair
,
drew
his
head
to
her
,
and
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
supposed
to
be
doing
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
her
laughing
;
*NL*
``
cleaning
shoes
or
dibbling
with
love
?
Answer
me
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
whichever
I
please
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
your
boot-boy
for
the
time
being
,
and
nothing
else
!
''
But
they
*NL*
remained
looking
into
each
other
's
eyes
and
laughing
.
Then
they
kissed
*NL*
with
little
nibbling
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
T-t-t-t
!
''
he
went
with
his
tongue
,
like
his
mother
.
``
I
tell
you
,
*NL*
nothing
gets
done
when
there
's
a
woman
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
returned
to
his
boot-cleaning
,
singing
softly
.
She
touched
his
*NL*
thick
hair
,
and
he
kissed
her
fingers
.
He
worked
away
at
her
shoes
.
At
*NL*
last
they
were
quite
presentable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
you
are
,
you
see
!
''
he
said
.
``
Are
n't
I
a
great
hand
at
restoring
*NL*
you
to
respectability
?
Stand
up
!
There
,
you
look
as
irreproachable
as
*NL*
Britannia
herself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
cleaned
his
own
boots
a
little
,
washed
his
hands
in
a
puddle
,
and
*NL*
sang
.
They
went
on
into
Clifton
village
.
He
was
madly
in
love
with
her
;
*NL*
every
movement
she
made
,
every
crease
in
her
garments
,
sent
a
hot
flash
*NL*
through
him
and
seemed
adorable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
at
whose
house
they
had
tea
was
roused
into
gaiety
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
wish
you
'd
had
something
of
a
better
day
,
''
she
said
,
hovering
*NL*
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
!
''
he
laughed
.
``
We
've
been
saying
how
nice
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
looked
at
him
curiously
.
There
was
a
peculiar
glow
*NL*
and
charm
about
him
.
His
eyes
were
dark
and
laughing
.
He
rubbed
his
*NL*
moustache
with
a
glad
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
saying
SO
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
a
light
rousing
in
her
old
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
!
''
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'm
sure
the
day
's
good
enough
,
''
said
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fussed
about
,
and
did
not
want
to
leave
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
'd
like
some
radishes
as
well
,
''
she
said
to
*NL*
Clara
;
``
but
I
've
got
some
in
the
garden
--
AND
a
cucumber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
flushed
.
She
looked
very
handsome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
some
radishes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
old
lady
pottered
off
gleefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
knew
!
''
said
Clara
quietly
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
does
n't
know
;
and
it
shows
we
're
nice
in
ourselves
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
.
You
look
quite
enough
to
satisfy
an
archangel
,
and
I
'm
sure
I
feel
*NL*
harmless
--
so
--
if
it
makes
you
look
nice
,
and
makes
folk
happy
when
they
*NL*
have
us
,
and
makes
us
happy
--
why
,
we
're
not
cheating
them
out
of
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
on
with
the
meal
.
When
they
were
going
away
,
the
old
lady
came
*NL*
timidly
with
three
tiny
dahlias
in
full
blow
,
neat
as
bees
,
and
speckled
*NL*
scarlet
and
white
.
She
stood
before
Clara
,
pleased
with
herself
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
--
''
and
holding
the
flowers
forward
in
her
old
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
pretty
!
''
cried
Clara
,
accepting
the
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
she
have
them
all
?
''
asked
Paul
reproachfully
of
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
shall
have
them
all
,
''
she
replied
,
beaming
with
joy
.
``
You
have
*NL*
got
enough
for
your
share
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
I
shall
ask
her
to
give
me
one
!
''
he
teased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
does
as
she
pleases
,
''
said
the
old
lady
,
smiling
.
And
she
*NL*
bobbed
a
little
curtsey
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
was
rather
quiet
and
uncomfortable
.
As
they
walked
along
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
feel
criminal
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
with
startled
grey
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Criminal
!
''
she
said
.
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
seem
to
feel
you
have
done
a
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
only
think
,
`
If
they
knew
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
knew
,
they
'd
cease
to
understand
.
As
it
is
,
they
do
understand
,
*NL*
and
they
like
it
.
What
do
they
matter
?
Here
,
with
only
the
trees
and
me
,
*NL*
you
do
n't
feel
not
the
least
bit
wrong
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
by
the
arm
,
held
her
facing
him
,
holding
her
eyes
with
his
.
*NL*
Something
fretted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
sinners
,
are
we
?
''
he
said
,
with
an
uneasy
little
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
your
little
bit
of
guiltiness
,
I
believe
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
believe
*NL*
Eve
enjoyed
it
,
when
she
went
cowering
out
of
Paradise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
a
certain
glow
and
quietness
about
her
that
made
him
glad
.
*NL*
When
he
was
alone
in
the
railway-carriage
,
he
found
himself
tumultuously
*NL*
happy
,
and
the
people
exceedingly
nice
,
and
the
night
lovely
,
and
*NL*
everything
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
was
sitting
reading
when
he
got
home
.
Her
health
was
not
good
*NL*
now
,
and
there
had
come
that
ivory
pallor
into
her
face
which
he
never
*NL*
noticed
,
and
which
afterwards
he
never
forgot
.
She
did
not
mention
her
*NL*
own
ill-health
to
him
.
After
all
,
she
thought
,
it
was
not
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
late
!
''
she
said
,
looking
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
were
shining
;
his
face
seemed
to
glow
.
He
smiled
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
've
been
down
Clifton
Grove
with
Clara
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
looked
at
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
wo
n't
people
talk
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
They
know
she
's
a
suffragette
,
and
so
on
.
And
what
if
they
do
*NL*
talk
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
there
may
be
nothing
wrong
in
it

''
said
his
mother
.
``
But
you

know
what
folks
are

if
once
she
gets
talked
about

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
ca
n't

it

Their
jaw
is

so
almighty
important

after

all

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
ought
to
consider
HER

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
DO

What
can
people
say

that
we
take
a

together

I

you
're
jealous

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
I
should
be
GLAD

she
were

a
married
woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
dear

she
lives
separate
from
her
husband

talks
on

platforms

she

already
singled
out
from
the
sheep
,
and
,
as
far
as
*NL*
I
can
see

has
n't
much
to
lose

No

her
life
's
nothing
to
her

so
what
's
*NL*
the
worth
of
nothing
?
She
goes
with
me
--
it
becomes
something

Then
she
*NL*
must
pay

we
both
must
pay

Folk
are
so
frightened
of
paying

they

rather
starve

die

*NL*
``
Very

*NL*
``
That

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

better

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
for
a
while

He
wanted
to
ask
his
mother
something
,
*NL*
but
was
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should

He

*NL*
``

Mrs.

coolly

Mrs.

flushed

*NL*
*NL*

His

laughed

*NL*
*NL*
``

He

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
he
still
walked
a
little
way
from
chapel
with
Miriam

*NL*
Edgar

He
did
not
go
up
to
the
farm

She

however

was
very
much
the

with
him

he
did
not
feel
embarrassed
in
her
presence
.
One
*NL*
evening
she
was
alone
when
he
accompanied
her
.
They
began
by
talking
*NL*
books
:
it
was
their
unfailing
topic
.
Mrs.
Morel
had
said
that
his
and
*NL*
Miriam
's
affair
was
like
a
fire
fed
on
books
--
if
there
were
no
more
*NL*
volumes
it
would
die
out
.
Miriam
,
for
her
part
,
boasted
that
she
could
*NL*
read
him
like
a
book
,
could
place
her
finger
any
minute
on
the
chapter
*NL*
and
the
line
.
He
,
easily
taken
in
,
believed
that
Miriam
knew
more
about
*NL*
him
than
anyone
else
.
So
it
pleased
him
to
talk
to
her
about
himself
,
*NL*
like
the
simplest
egoist
.
Very
soon
the
conversation
drifted
to
his
own
*NL*
doings
.
It
flattered
him
immensely
that
he
was
of
such
supreme
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
have
you
been
doing
lately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
oh
,
not
much
!
I
made
a
sketch
of
Bestwood
from
the
garden
,
that
is
*NL*
nearly
right
at
last
.
It
's
the
hundredth
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
went
on
.
Then
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
not
been
out
,
then
,
lately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
went
up
Clifton
Grove
on
Monday
afternoon
with
Clara
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
very
nice
weather
,
''
said
Miriam
,
``
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
wanted
to
go
out
,
and
it
was
all
right
.
The
Trent
IS
full
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
you
go
to
Barton
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
we
had
tea
in
Clifton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
DID
you
!
That
would
be
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
!
The
jolliest
old
woman
!
She
gave
us
several
pompom
dahlias
,
as
*NL*
pretty
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
bowed
her
head
and
brooded
.
He
was
quite
unconscious
of
*NL*
concealing
anything
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made
her
give
them
you
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
liked
us
--
because
we
were
jolly
,
I
should
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
put
her
finger
in
her
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
late
home
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
resented
her
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
caught
the
seven-thirty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
on
in
silence
,
and
he
was
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
IS
Clara
?
''
asked
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
all
right
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good
!
''
she
said
,
with
a
tinge
of
irony
.
``
By
the
way
,
what
of
her
*NL*
husband
?
One
never
hears
anything
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
got
some
other
woman
,
and
is
also
quite
all
right
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
``
At
least
,
so
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
--
you
do
n't
know
for
certain
.
Do
n't
you
think
a
position
like
that
*NL*
is
hard
on
a
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rottenly
hard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
unjust
!
''
said
Miriam
.
``
The
man
does
as
he
likes
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
the
woman
also
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
she
?
And
if
she
does
,
look
at
her
position
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
impossible
!
You
do
n't
understand
what
a
woman
forfeits
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
.
But
if
a
woman
's
got
nothing
but
her
fair
fame
to
feed
on
,
*NL*
why
,
it
's
thin
tack
,
and
a
donkey
would
die
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
understood
his
moral
attitude
,
at
least
,
and
she
knew
he
would
*NL*
act
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
asked
him
anything
direct
,
but
she
got
to
know
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
day
,
when
he
saw
Miriam
,
the
conversation
turned
to
marriage
,
*NL*
then
to
Clara
's
marriage
with
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
he
said
,
``
she
never
knew
the
fearful
importance
of
marriage
.
*NL*
She
thought
it
was
all
in
the
day
's
march
--
it
would
have
to
come
--
and
*NL*
Dawes
--
well
,
a
good
many
women
would
have
given
their
souls
to
get
*NL*
him
;
so
why
not
him
?
Then
she
developed
into
the
femme
incomprise
,
and
*NL*
treated
him
badly
,
I
'll
bet
my
boots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
left
him
because
he
did
n't
understand
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
.
I
suppose
she
had
to
.
It
is
n't
altogether
a
question
*NL*
of
understanding
;
it
's
a
question
of
living
.
With
him
,
she
was
only
*NL*
half-alive
;
the
rest
was
dormant
,
deadened
.
And
the
dormant
woman
was
*NL*
the
femme
incomprise
,
and
she
HAD
to
be
awakened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
about
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
rather
think
he
loves
her
as
much
as
he
can
,
but
he
's
a
*NL*
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
something
like
your
mother
and
father
,
''
said
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
my
mother
,
I
believe
,
got
real
joy
and
satisfaction
out
of
*NL*
my
father
at
first
.
I
believe
she
had
a
passion
for
him
;
that
's
why
she
*NL*
stayed
with
him
.
After
all
,
they
were
bound
to
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
one
MUST
HAVE
,
I
think
,
''
he
continued
--
``
the
real
,
real
*NL*
flame
of
feeling
through
another
person
--
once
,
only
once
,
if
it
only
*NL*
lasts
three
months
.
See
,
my
mother
looks
as
if
she
'd
HAD
everything
that
*NL*
was
necessary
for
her
living
and
developing
.
There
's
not
a
tiny
bit
of
*NL*
feeling
of
sterility
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
with
my
father
,
at
first
,
I
'm
sure
she
had
the
real
thing
.
She
*NL*
knows
;
she
has
been
there
.
You
can
feel
it
about
her
,
and
about
him
,
and
*NL*
about
hundreds
of
people
you
meet
every
day
;
and
,
once
it
has
happened
*NL*
to
you
,
you
can
go
on
with
anything
and
ripen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
happened
,
exactly
?
''
asked
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
hard
to
say
,
but
the
something
big
and
intense
that
changes
*NL*
you
when
you
really
come
together
with
somebody
else
.
It
almost
seems
to
*NL*
fertilise
your
soul
and
make
it
that
you
can
go
on
and
mature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
think
your
mother
had
it
with
your
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
at
the
bottom
she
feels
grateful
to
him
for
giving
it
her
,
*NL*
even
now
,
though
they
are
miles
apart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
think
Clara
never
had
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
pondered
this
.
She
saw
what
he
was
seeking
--
a
sort
of
baptism
of
*NL*
fire
in
passion
,
it
seemed
to
her
.
She
realised
that
he
would
never
be
*NL*
satisfied
till
he
had
it
.
Perhaps
it
was
essential
to
him
,
as
to
some
*NL*
men
,
to
sow
wild
oats
;
and
afterwards
,
when
he
was
satisfied
,
he
would
*NL*
not
rage
with
restlessness
any
more
,
but
could
settle
down
and
give
her
*NL*
his
life
into
her
hands
.
Well
,
then
,
if
he
must
go
,
let
him
go
and
have
*NL*
his
fill
--
something
big
and
intense
,
he
called
it
.
At
any
rate
,
when
he
*NL*
had
got
it
,
he
would
not
want
it
--
that
he
said
himself
;
he
would
want
*NL*
the
other
thing
that
she
could
give
him
.
He
would
want
to
be
owned
,
so
*NL*
that
he
could
work
.
It
seemed
to
her
a
bitter
thing
that
he
must
go
,
but
*NL*
she
could
let
him
go
into
an
inn
for
a
glass
of
whisky
,
so
she
could
let
*NL*
him
go
to
Clara
,
so
long
as
it
was
something
that
would
satisfy
a
need
*NL*
in
him
,
and
leave
him
free
for
herself
to
possess
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
told
your
mother
about
Clara
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
this
would
be
a
test
of
the
seriousness
of
his
feeling
for
the
*NL*
other
woman
:
she
knew
he
was
going
to
Clara
for
something
vital
,
not
as
*NL*
a
man
goes
for
pleasure
to
a
prostitute
,
if
he
told
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
she
is
coming
to
tea
on
Sunday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
your
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
want
mater
to
see
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
.
Things
had
gone
quicker
than
she
thought
.
She
felt
*NL*
a
sudden
bitterness
that
he
could
leave
her
so
soon
and
so
entirely
.
*NL*
And
was
Clara
to
be
accepted
by
his
people
,
who
had
been
so
hostile
to
*NL*
herself
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
call
in
as
I
go
to
chapel
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
is
a
long
time
since
I
*NL*
saw
Clara
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
he
said
,
astonished
,
and
unconsciously
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Sunday
afternoon
he
went
to
Keston
to
meet
Clara
at
the
station
.
*NL*
As
he
stood
on
the
platform
he
was
trying
to
examine
in
himself
if
he
*NL*
had
a
premonition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
FEEL
as
if
she
'd
come
?
''
he
said
to
himself
,
and
he
tried
to
find
*NL*
out
.
His
heart
felt
queer
and
contracted
.
That
seemed
like
foreboding
.
*NL*
Then
he
HAD
a
foreboding
she
would
not
come
!
Then
she
would
not
come
,
*NL*
and
instead
of
taking
her
over
the
fields
home
,
as
he
had
imagined
,
*NL*
he
would
have
to
go
alone
.
The
train
was
late
;
the
afternoon
would
*NL*
be
wasted
,
and
the
evening
.
He
hated
her
for
not
coming
.
Why
had
she
*NL*
promised
,
then
,
if
she
could
not
keep
her
promise
?
Perhaps
she
had
*NL*
missed
her
train
--
he
himself
was
always
missing
trains
--
but
that
was
no
*NL*
reason
why
she
should
miss
this
particular
one
.
He
was
angry
with
her
;
*NL*
he
was
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
saw
the
train
crawling
,
sneaking
round
the
corner
.
Here
,
*NL*
then
,
was
the
train
,
but
of
course
she
had
not
come
.
The
green
engine
*NL*
hissed
along
the
platform
,
the
row
of
brown
carriages
drew
up
,
several
*NL*
doors
opened
.
No
;
she
had
not
come
!
No
!
Yes
;
ah
,
there
she
was
!
She
had
*NL*
a
big
black
hat
on
!
He
was
at
her
side
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
n't
coming
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
laughing
rather
breathlessly
as
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
;
*NL*
their
eyes
met
.
He
took
her
quickly
along
the
platform
,
talking
at
a
*NL*
great
rate
to
hide
his
feeling
.
She
looked
beautiful
.
In
her
hat
were
*NL*
large
silk
roses
,
coloured
like
tarnished
gold
.
Her
costume
of
dark
*NL*
cloth
fitted
so
beautifully
over
her
breast
and
shoulders
.
His
pride
*NL*
went
up
as
he
walked
with
her
.
He
felt
the
station
people
,
who
knew
him
,
*NL*
eyed
her
with
awe
and
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sure
you
were
n't
coming
,
''
he
laughed
shakily
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
in
answer
,
almost
with
a
little
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
wondered
,
when
I
was
in
the
train
,
WHATEVER
I
should
do
if
you
*NL*
were
n't
there
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
caught
her
hand
impulsively
,
and
they
went
along
the
narrow
twitchel
.
*NL*
They
took
the
road
into
Nuttall
and
over
the
Reckoning
House
Farm
.
It
*NL*
was
a
blue
,
mild
day
.
Everywhere
the
brown
leaves
lay
scattered
;
many
*NL*
scarlet
hips
stood
upon
the
hedge
beside
the
wood
.
He
gathered
a
few
for
*NL*
her
to
wear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
,
really
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
fitted
them
into
the
breast
of
her
*NL*
coat
,
``
you
ought
to
object
to
my
getting
them
,
because
of
the
birds
.
*NL*
But
they
do
n't
care
much
for
rose-hips
in
this
part
,
where
they
can
*NL*
get
plenty
of
stuff
.
You
often
find
the
berries
going
rotten
in
the
*NL*
springtime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
chattered
,
scarcely
aware
of
what
he
said
,
only
knowing
he
was
*NL*
putting
berries
in
the
bosom
of
her
coat
,
while
she
stood
patiently
for
*NL*
him
.
And
she
watched
his
quick
hands
,
so
full
of
life
,
and
it
seemed
to
*NL*
her
she
had
never
SEEN
anything
before
.
Till
now
,
everything
had
been
*NL*
indistinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
near
to
the
colliery
.
It
stood
quite
still
and
black
among
the
*NL*
corn-fields
,
its
immense
heap
of
slag
seen
rising
almost
from
the
oats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
there
is
a
coal-pit
here
where
it
is
so
pretty
!
''
said
*NL*
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
he
answered
.
``
You
see
,
I
am
so
used
to
it
I
should
*NL*
miss
it
.
No
;
and
I
like
the
pits
here
and
there
.
I
like
the
rows
of
*NL*
trucks
,
and
the
headstocks
,
and
the
steam
in
the
daytime
,
and
the
lights
*NL*
at
night
.
When
I
was
a
boy
,
I
always
thought
a
pillar
of
cloud
by
day
*NL*
and
a
pillar
of
fire
by
night
was
a
pit
,
with
its
steam
,
and
its
*NL*
lights
,
and
the
burning
bank
,
--
and
I
thought
the
Lord
was
always
at
the
*NL*
pit-top
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
drew
near
home
she
walked
in
silence
,
and
seemed
to
hang
back
.
*NL*
He
pressed
her
fingers
in
his
own
.
She
flushed
,
but
gave
no
response
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
want
to
come
home
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
want
to
come
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
occur
to
him
that
her
position
in
his
home
would
be
rather
a
*NL*
peculiar
and
difficult
one
.
To
him
it
seemed
just
as
if
one
of
his
men
*NL*
friends
were
going
to
be
introduced
to
his
mother
,
only
nicer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Morels
lived
in
a
house
in
an
ugly
street
that
ran
down
a
steep
*NL*
hill
.
The
street
itself
was
hideous
.
The
house
was
rather
superior
*NL*
to
most
.
It
was
old
,
grimy
,
with
a
big
bay
window
,
and
it
was
*NL*
semi-detached
;
but
it
looked
gloomy
.
Then
Paul
opened
the
door
to
the
*NL*
garden
,
and
all
was
different
.
The
sunny
afternoon
was
there
,
like
*NL*
another
land
.
By
the
path
grew
tansy
and
little
trees
.
In
front
of
the
*NL*
window
was
a
plot
of
sunny
grass
,
with
old
lilacs
round
it
.
And
away
*NL*
went
the
garden
,
with
heaps
of
dishevelled
chrysanthemums
in
the
*NL*
sunshine
,
down
to
the
sycamore-tree
,
and
the
field
,
and
beyond
one
*NL*
looked
over
a
few
red-roofed
cottages
to
the
hills
with
all
the
glow
of
*NL*
the
autumn
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
sat
in
her
rocking-chair
,
wearing
her
black
silk
blouse
.
*NL*
Her
grey-brown
hair
was
taken
smooth
back
from
her
brow
and
her
high
*NL*
temples
;
her
face
was
rather
pale
.
Clara
,
suffering
,
followed
Paul
into
*NL*
the
kitchen
.
Mrs.
Morel
rose
.
Clara
thought
her
a
lady
,
even
rather
*NL*
stiff
.
The
young
woman
was
very
nervous
.
She
had
almost
a
wistful
look
,
*NL*
almost
resigned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
--
Clara
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
held
out
her
hand
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
told
me
a
good
deal
about
you
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
flamed
in
Clara
's
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
you
do
n't
mind
my
coming
,
''
she
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
pleased
when
he
said
he
would
bring
you
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
,
watching
,
felt
his
heart
contract
with
pain
.
His
mother
looked
so
*NL*
small
,
and
sallow
,
and
done-for
beside
the
luxuriant
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
such
a
pretty
day
,
mother
!
''
he
said
.
``
And
we
saw
a
jay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
looked
at
him
;
he
had
turned
to
her
.
She
thought
what
a
*NL*
man
he
seemed
,
in
his
dark
,
well-made
clothes
.
He
was
pale
and
*NL*
detached-looking
;
it
would
be
hard
for
any
woman
to
keep
him
.
Her
heart
*NL*
glowed
;
then
she
was
sorry
for
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
'll
leave
your
things
in
the
parlour
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
*NL*
nicely
to
the
young
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
''
said
Paul
,
and
he
led
the
way
into
the
little
front
room
,
*NL*
with
its
old
piano
,
its
mahogany
furniture
,
its
yellowing
marble
*NL*
mantelpiece
.
A
fire
was
burning
;
the
place
was
littered
with
books
and
*NL*
drawing-boards
.
``
I
leave
my
things
lying
about
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
so
much
*NL*
easier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
loved
his
artist
's
paraphernalia
,
and
the
books
,
and
the
photos
of
*NL*
people
.
Soon
he
was
telling
her
:
this
was
William
,
this
was
William
's
*NL*
young
lady
in
the
evening
dress
,
this
was
Annie
and
her
husband
,
this
*NL*
was
Arthur
and
his
wife
and
the
baby
.
She
felt
as
if
she
were
being
*NL*
taken
into
the
family
.
He
showed
her
photos
,
books
,
sketches
,
and
they
*NL*
talked
a
little
while
.
Then
they
returned
to
the
kitchen
.
Mrs.
Morel
put
*NL*
aside
her
book
.
Clara
wore
a
blouse
of
fine
silk
chiffon
,
with
narrow
*NL*
black-and-white
stripes
;
her
hair
was
done
simply
,
coiled
on
top
of
her
*NL*
head
.
She
looked
rather
stately
and
reserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
gone
to
live
down
Sneinton
Boulevard
?
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
``
When
*NL*
I
was
a
girl
--
girl
,
I
say
!
--
when
I
was
a
young
woman
WE
lived
in
Minerva
*NL*
Terrace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
did
you
!
''
said
Clara
.
``
I
have
a
friend
in
number
6
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
conversation
had
started
.
They
talked
Nottingham
and
Nottingham
*NL*
people
;
it
interested
them
both
.
Clara
was
still
rather
nervous
;
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
was
still
somewhat
on
her
dignity
.
She
clipped
her
language
very
*NL*
clear
and
precise
.
But
they
were
going
to
get
on
well
together
,
Paul
*NL*
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
measured
herself
against
the
younger
woman
,
and
found
herself
*NL*
easily
stronger
.
Clara
was
deferential
.
She
knew
Paul
's
surprising
*NL*
regard
for
his
mother
,
and
she
had
dreaded
the
meeting
,
expecting
*NL*
someone
rather
hard
and
cold
.
She
was
surprised
to
find
this
little
*NL*
interested
woman
chatting
with
such
readiness
;
and
then
she
felt
,
as
she
*NL*
felt
with
Paul
,
that
she
would
not
care
to
stand
in
Mrs.
Morel
's
way
.
*NL*
There
was
something
so
hard
and
certain
in
his
mother
,
as
if
she
never
*NL*
had
a
misgiving
in
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Morel
came
down
,
ruffled
and
yawning
,
from
his
afternoon
*NL*
sleep
.
He
scratched
his
grizzled
head
,
he
plodded
in
his
stocking
feet
,
*NL*
his
waistcoat
hung
open
over
his
shirt
.
He
seemed
incongruous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
Mrs.
Dawes
,
father
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Morel
pulled
himself
together
.
Clara
saw
Paul
's
manner
of
bowing
*NL*
and
shaking
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
''
exclaimed
Morel
.
``
I
am
very
glad
to
see
you
--
I
am
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
.
But
do
n't
disturb
yourself
.
No
,
no
make
yourself
quite
*NL*
comfortable
,
and
be
very
welcome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
was
astonished
at
this
flood
of
hospitality
from
the
old
collier
.
*NL*
He
was
so
courteous
,
so
gallant
!
She
thought
him
most
delightful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
may
you
have
come
far
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
from
Nottingham
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Nottingham
!
Then
you
have
had
a
beautiful
day
for
your
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
strayed
into
the
scullery
to
wash
his
hands
and
face
,
and
from
*NL*
force
of
habit
came
on
to
the
hearth
with
the
towel
to
dry
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
tea
Clara
felt
the
refinement
and
sang-froid
of
the
household
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Morel
was
perfectly
at
her
ease
.
The
pouring
out
the
tea
and
attending
*NL*
to
the
people
went
on
unconsciously
,
without
interrupting
her
in
her
*NL*
talk
.
There
was
a
lot
of
room
at
the
oval
table
;
the
china
of
dark
blue
*NL*
willow-pattern
looked
pretty
on
the
glossy
cloth
.
There
was
a
little
*NL*
bowl
of
small
,
yellow
chrysanthemums
.
Clara
felt
she
completed
the
*NL*
circle
,
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
her
.
But
she
was
rather
afraid
of
the
*NL*
self-possession
of
the
Morels
,
father
and
all
.
She
took
their
tone
;
*NL*
there
was
a
feeling
of
balance
.
It
was
a
cool
,
clear
atmosphere
,
where
*NL*
everyone
was
himself
,
and
in
harmony
.
Clara
enjoyed
it
,
but
there
was
a
*NL*
fear
deep
at
the
bottom
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
cleared
the
table
whilst
his
mother
and
Clara
talked
.
Clara
was
*NL*
conscious
of
his
quick
,
vigorous
body
as
it
came
and
went
,
seeming
blown
*NL*
quickly
by
a
wind
at
its
work
.
It
was
almost
like
the
hither
and
thither
*NL*
of
a
leaf
that
comes
unexpected
.
Most
of
herself
went
with
him
.
By
the
*NL*
way
she
leaned
forward
,
as
if
listening
,
Mrs.
Morel
could
see
she
was
*NL*
possessed
elsewhere
as
she
talked
,
and
again
the
elder
woman
was
sorry
*NL*
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
finished
,
he
strolled
down
the
garden
,
leaving
the
two
women
*NL*
to
talk
.
It
was
a
hazy
,
sunny
afternoon
,
mild
and
soft
.
Clara
glanced
*NL*
through
the
window
after
him
as
he
loitered
among
the
chrysanthemums
.
*NL*
She
felt
as
if
something
almost
tangible
fastened
her
to
him
;
yet
he
*NL*
seemed
so
easy
in
his
graceful
,
indolent
movement
,
so
detached
as
he
*NL*
tied
up
the
too-heavy
flower
branches
to
their
stakes
,
that
she
wanted
*NL*
to
shriek
in
her
helplessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
let
me
help
you
wash
up
,
''
said
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
there
are
so
few
,
it
will
only
take
a
minute
,
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
,
however
,
dried
the
tea-things
,
and
was
glad
to
be
on
such
good
*NL*
terms
with
his
mother
;
but
it
was
torture
not
to
be
able
to
follow
him
*NL*
down
the
garden
.
At
last
she
allowed
herself
to
go
;
she
felt
as
if
a
*NL*
rope
were
taken
off
her
ankle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
was
golden
over
the
hills
of
Derbyshire
.
He
stood
across
*NL*
in
the
other
garden
,
beside
a
bush
of
pale
Michaelmas
daisies
,
watching
*NL*
the
last
bees
crawl
into
the
hive
.
Hearing
her
coming
,
he
turned
to
her
*NL*
with
an
easy
motion
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
end
of
the
run
with
these
chaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
stood
near
him
.
Over
the
low
red
wall
in
front
was
the
country
and
*NL*
the
far-off
hills
,
all
golden
dim
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Miriam
was
entering
through
the
garden-door
.
She
saw
*NL*
Clara
go
up
to
him
,
saw
him
turn
,
and
saw
them
come
to
rest
together
.
*NL*
Something
in
their
perfect
isolation
together
made
her
know
that
it
was
*NL*
accomplished
between
them
,
that
they
were
,
as
she
put
it
,
married
.
She
*NL*
walked
very
slowly
down
the
cinder-track
of
the
long
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
had
pulled
a
button
from
a
hollyhock
spire
,
and
was
breaking
it
*NL*
to
get
the
seeds
.
Above
her
bowed
head
the
pink
flowers
stared
,
as
if
*NL*
defending
her
.
The
last
bees
were
falling
down
to
the
hive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Count
your
money
,
''
laughed
Paul
,
as
she
broke
the
flat
seeds
one
by
one
*NL*
from
the
roll
of
coin
.
She
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
well
off
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
Pf
!
''
He
snapped
his
fingers
.
``
Can
I
turn
them
into
gold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
not
,
''
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
into
each
other
's
eyes
,
laughing
.
At
that
moment
they
became
*NL*
aware
of
Miriam
.
There
was
a
click
,
and
everything
had
altered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Miriam
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
You
said
you
'd
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Had
you
forgotten
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
hands
with
Clara
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
strange
to
see
you
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
other
;
``
it
seems
strange
to
be
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
pretty
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
it
very
much
,
''
replied
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Miriam
realised
that
Clara
was
accepted
as
she
had
never
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
come
down
alone
?
''
asked
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
went
to
Agatha
's
to
tea
.
We
are
going
to
chapel
.
I
only
called
*NL*
in
for
a
moment
to
see
Clara
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
come
in
here
to
tea
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
laughed
shortly
,
and
Clara
turned
impatiently
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
the
chrysanthemums
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
they
are
very
fine
,
''
replied
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
sort
do
you
like
best
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
The
bronze
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
you
've
seen
all
the
sorts
.
Come
and
look
.
Come
and
see
*NL*
which
are
YOUR
favourites
,
Clara
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
led
the
two
women
back
to
his
own
garden
,
where
the
towsled
bushes
of
*NL*
flowers
of
all
colours
stood
raggedly
along
the
path
down
to
the
field
.
*NL*
The
situation
did
not
embarrass
him
,
to
his
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
Miriam
;
these
are
the
white
ones
that
came
from
your
garden
.
They
*NL*
are
n't
so
fine
here
,
are
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
're
hardier
.
You
're
so
sheltered
;
things
grow
big
and
tender
,
*NL*
and
then
die
.
These
little
yellow
ones
I
like
.
Will
you
have
some
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
out
there
the
bells
began
to
ring
in
the
church
,
*NL*
sounding
loud
across
the
town
and
the
field
.
Miriam
looked
at
the
tower
,
*NL*
proud
among
the
clustering
roofs
,
and
remembered
the
sketches
he
had
*NL*
brought
her
.
It
had
been
different
then
,
but
he
had
not
left
her
even
*NL*
yet
.
She
asked
him
for
a
book
to
read
.
He
ran
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
is
that
Miriam
?
''
asked
his
mother
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
she
said
she
'd
call
and
see
Clara
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
told
her
,
then
?
''
came
the
sarcastic
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
why
should
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
certainly
no
reason
why
you
should
n't
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
,
and
*NL*
she
returned
to
her
book
.
He
winced
from
his
mother
's
irony
,
frowned
*NL*
irritably
,
thinking
:
``
Why
ca
n't
I
do
as
I
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
not
seen
Mrs.
Morel
before
?
''
Miriam
was
saying
to
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
she
's
so
nice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Miriam
,
dropping
her
head
;
``
in
some
ways
she
's
very
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
Paul
told
you
much
about
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
talked
a
good
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
until
he
returned
with
the
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
you
want
it
back
?
''
Miriam
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
like
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
turned
to
go
indoors
,
whilst
he
accompanied
Miriam
to
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
you
come
up
to
Willey
Farm
?
''
the
latter
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
say
,
''
replied
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
asked
me
to
say
she
'd
be
pleased
to
see
you
any
time
,
if
you
*NL*
cared
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
I
should
like
to
,
but
I
ca
n't
say
when
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
!
''
exclaimed
Miriam
rather
bitterly
,
turning
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
down
the
path
with
her
mouth
to
the
flowers
he
had
given
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
sure
you
wo
n't
come
in
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
going
to
chapel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
shall
see
you
,
then
!
''
Miriam
was
very
bitter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
parted
.
He
felt
guilty
towards
her
.
She
was
bitter
,
and
she
scorned
*NL*
him
.
He
still
belonged
to
herself
,
she
believed
;
yet
he
could
have
*NL*
Clara
,
take
her
home
,
sit
with
her
next
his
mother
in
chapel
,
give
her
*NL*
the
same
hymn-book
he
had
given
herself
years
before
.
She
heard
him
*NL*
running
quickly
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
not
go
straight
in
.
Halting
on
the
plot
of
grass
,
he
heard
*NL*
his
mother
's
voice
,
then
Clara
's
answer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
hate
is
the
bloodhound
quality
in
Miriam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
his
mother
quickly
,
``
yes
;
DOES
N'T
it
make
you
hate
her
,
*NL*
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
went
hot
,
and
he
was
angry
with
them
for
talking
about
the
*NL*
girl
.
What
right
had
they
to
say
that
?
Something
in
the
speech
itself
*NL*
stung
him
into
a
flame
of
hate
against
Miriam
.
Then
his
own
heart
*NL*
rebelled
furiously
at
Clara
's
taking
the
liberty
of
speaking
so
about
*NL*
Miriam
.
After
all
,
the
girl
was
the
better
woman
of
the
two
,
he
thought
,
*NL*
if
it
came
to
goodness
.
He
went
indoors
.
His
mother
looked
excited
.
She
*NL*
was
beating
with
her
hand
rhythmically
on
the
sofa-arm
,
as
women
do
who
*NL*
are
wearing
out
.
He
could
never
bear
to
see
the
movement
.
There
was
a
*NL*
silence
;
then
he
began
to
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
chapel
Miriam
saw
him
find
the
place
in
the
hymn-book
for
Clara
,
in
*NL*
exactly
the
same
way
as
he
used
for
herself
.
And
during
the
sermon
he
*NL*
could
see
the
girl
across
the
chapel
,
her
hat
throwing
a
dark
shadow
*NL*
over
her
face
.
What
did
she
think
,
seeing
Clara
with
him
?
He
did
not
*NL*
stop
to
consider
.
He
felt
himself
cruel
towards
Miriam
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
chapel
he
went
over
Pentrich
with
Clara
.
It
was
a
dark
autumn
*NL*
night
.
They
had
said
good-bye
to
Miriam
,
and
his
heart
had
smitten
him
*NL*
as
he
left
the
girl
alone
.
``
But
it
serves
her
right
,
''
he
said
inside
*NL*
himself
,
and
it
almost
gave
him
pleasure
to
go
off
under
her
eyes
with
*NL*
this
other
handsome
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
scent
of
damp
leaves
in
the
darkness
.
Clara
's
hand
lay
warm
*NL*
and
inert
in
his
own
as
they
walked
.
He
was
full
of
conflict
.
The
battle
*NL*
that
raged
inside
him
made
him
feel
desperate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
Pentrich
Hill
Clara
leaned
against
him
as
he
went
.
He
slid
his
arm
*NL*
round
her
waist
.
Feeling
the
strong
motion
of
her
body
under
his
arm
as
*NL*
she
walked
,
the
tightness
in
his
chest
because
of
Miriam
relaxed
,
and
*NL*
the
hot
blood
bathed
him
.
He
held
her
closer
and
closer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
:
``
You
still
keep
on
with
Miriam
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
talk
.
There
never
WAS
a
great
deal
more
than
talk
between
us
,
''
he
*NL*
said
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
does
n't
care
for
her
,
''
said
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
or
I
might
have
married
her
.
But
it
's
all
up
really
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
his
voice
went
passionate
with
hate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
was
with
her
now
,
we
should
be
jawing
about
the
`
Christian
*NL*
Mystery
'
,
or
some
such
tack
.
Thank
God
,
I
'm
not
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ca
n't
really
give
her
up
,
''
said
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
give
her
up
,
because
there
's
nothing
to
give
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
why
she
and
I
should
n't
be
friends
as
long
as
we
live
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
But
it
'll
only
be
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
drew
away
from
him
,
leaning
away
from
contact
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
drawing
away
for
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
,
but
drew
farther
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
want
to
walk
alone
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
there
was
no
answer
.
She
walked
resentfully
,
hanging
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
said
I
would
be
friends
with
Miriam
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
not
answer
him
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
it
's
only
words
that
go
between
us
,
''
he
persisted
,
trying
to
*NL*
take
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
resisted
.
Suddenly
he
strode
across
in
front
of
her
,
barring
her
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
!
''
he
said
.
``
What
do
you
want
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
run
after
Miriam
,
''
mocked
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
flamed
up
in
him
.
He
stood
showing
his
teeth
.
She
drooped
*NL*
sulkily
.
The
lane
was
dark
,
quite
lonely
.
He
suddenly
caught
her
in
*NL*
his
arms
,
stretched
forward
,
and
put
his
mouth
on
her
face
in
a
kiss
of
*NL*
rage
.
She
turned
frantically
to
avoid
him
.
He
held
her
fast
.
Hard
and
*NL*
relentless
his
mouth
came
for
her
.
Her
breasts
hurt
against
the
wall
of
*NL*
his
chest
.
Helpless
,
she
went
loose
in
his
arms
,
and
he
kissed
her
,
and
*NL*
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
people
coming
down
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
up
!
stand
up
!
''
he
said
thickly
,
gripping
her
arm
till
it
hurt
.
If
*NL*
he
had
let
go
,
she
would
have
sunk
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sighed
and
walked
dizzily
beside
him
.
They
went
on
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
go
over
the
fields
,
''
he
said
;
and
then
she
woke
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
let
herself
be
helped
over
the
stile
,
and
she
walked
in
silence
*NL*
with
him
over
the
first
dark
field
.
It
was
the
way
to
Nottingham
and
to
*NL*
the
station
,
she
knew
.
He
seemed
to
be
looking
about
.
They
came
out
on
*NL*
a
bare
hilltop
where
stood
the
dark
figure
of
the
ruined
windmill
.
There
*NL*
he
halted
.
They
stood
together
high
up
in
the
darkness
,
looking
at
*NL*
the
lights
scattered
on
the
night
before
them
,
handfuls
of
glittering
*NL*
points
,
villages
lying
high
and
low
on
the
dark
,
here
and
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
treading
among
the
stars
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
quaky
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
took
her
in
his
arms
,
and
held
her
fast
.
She
moved
aside
her
*NL*
mouth
to
ask
,
dogged
and
low
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
matter
,
''
he
pleaded
thickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
it
does
--
yes
!
I
must
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
early
yet
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
is
it
?
''
she
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
round
lay
the
black
night
,
speckled
and
spangled
with
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hand
on
his
chest
,
feeling
for
his
watch
.
He
felt
the
joints
*NL*
fuse
into
fire
.
She
groped
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
while
he
stood
*NL*
panting
.
In
the
darkness
she
could
see
the
round
,
pale
face
of
the
*NL*
watch
,
but
not
the
figures
.
She
stooped
over
it
.
He
was
panting
till
he
*NL*
could
take
her
in
his
arms
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
see
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do
n't
bother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
'm
going
!
''
she
said
,
turning
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
!
I
'll
look
!
''
But
he
could
not
see
.
``
I
'll
strike
a
match
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
secretly
hoped
it
was
too
late
to
catch
the
train
.
She
saw
the
*NL*
glowing
lantern
of
his
hands
as
he
cradled
the
light
:
then
his
face
lit
*NL*
up
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
watch
.
Instantly
all
was
dark
again
.
All
was
*NL*
black
before
her
eyes
;
only
a
glowing
match
was
red
near
her
feet
.
Where
*NL*
was
he
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
she
asked
,
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
do
it
,
''
his
voice
answered
out
of
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
.
She
felt
in
his
power
.
She
had
heard
the
ring
in
his
*NL*
voice
.
It
frightened
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
is
it
?
''
she
asked
,
quiet
,
definite
,
hopeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
minutes
to
nine
,
''
he
replied
,
telling
the
truth
with
a
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
can
I
get
from
here
to
the
station
in
fourteen
minutes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
At
any
rate
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
distinguish
his
dark
form
again
a
yard
or
so
away
.
She
wanted
*NL*
to
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
ca
n't
I
do
it
?
''
she
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
hurry
,
''
he
said
brusquely
.
``
But
you
could
easily
walk
it
,
Clara
;
*NL*
it
's
only
seven
miles
to
the
tram
.
I
'll
come
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
want
to
catch
the
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
--
I
want
to
catch
the
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
his
voice
altered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
he
said
,
dry
and
hard
.
``
Come
along
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
plunged
ahead
into
the
darkness
.
She
ran
after
him
,
wanting
to
*NL*
cry
.
Now
he
was
hard
and
cruel
to
her
.
She
ran
over
the
rough
,
dark
*NL*
fields
behind
him
,
out
of
breath
,
ready
to
drop
.
But
the
double
row
of
*NL*
lights
at
the
station
drew
nearer
.
Suddenly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
she
is
!
''
he
cried
,
breaking
into
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
faint
rattling
noise
.
Away
to
the
right
the
train
,
like
*NL*
a
luminous
caterpillar
,
was
threading
across
the
night
.
The
rattling
*NL*
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
over
the
viaduct
.
You
'll
just
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
ran
,
quite
out
of
breath
,
and
fell
at
last
into
the
train
.
The
*NL*
whistle
blew
.
He
was
gone
.
Gone

and
she
was
in
a
carriage
full
of
*NL*
people
.
She
felt
the
cruelty
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
and
plunged
home
.
Before
he
knew
where
he
was
he
was
*NL*
in
the
kitchen
at
home
.
He
was
very
pale
.
His
eyes
were
dark
and
*NL*
dangerous-looking
,
as
if
he
were
drunk
.
His
mother
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
must
say
your
boots
are
in
a
nice
state
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
his
feet
.
Then
he
took
off
his
overcoat
.
His
mother
*NL*
wondered
if
he
were
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
caught
the
train
then
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
HER
feet
were
n't
so
filthy
.
Where
on
earth
you
dragged
her
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
and
motionless
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
like
her
?
''
he
asked
grudgingly
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
liked
her
.
But
you
'll
tire
of
her
,
my
son
;
you
know
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
answer
.
She
noticed
how
he
laboured
in
his
breathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
running
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
to
run
for
the
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
go
and
knock
yourself
up
.
You
'd
better
drink
hot
milk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
good
a
stimulant
as
he
could
have
,
but
he
refused
and
went
to
*NL*
bed
.
There
he
lay
face
down
on
the
counterpane
,
and
shed
tears
of
rage
*NL*
and
pain
.
There
was
a
physical
pain
that
made
him
bite
his
lips
till
*NL*
they
bled
,
and
the
chaos
inside
him
left
him
unable
to
think
,
almost
to
*NL*
feel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
how
she
serves
me
,
is
it
?
''
he
said
in
his
heart
,
over
and
over
,
*NL*
pressing
his
face
in
the
quilt
.
And
he
hated
her
.
Again
he
went
over
the
*NL*
scene
,
and
again
he
hated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
there
was
a
new
aloofness
about
him
.
Clara
was
very
gentle
,
*NL*
almost
loving
.
But
he
treated
her
distantly
,
with
a
touch
of
contempt
.
*NL*
She
sighed
,
continuing
to
be
gentle
.
He
came
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
of
that
week
Sarah
Bernhardt
was
at
the
Theatre
Royal
in
*NL*
Nottingham
,
giving
``
La
Dame
aux
Camelias
''
.
Paul
wanted
to
see
this
old
*NL*
and
famous
actress
,
and
he
asked
Clara
to
accompany
him
.
He
told
his
*NL*
mother
to
leave
the
key
in
the
window
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
book
seats
?
''
he
asked
of
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
And
put
on
an
evening
suit
,
will
you
?
I
've
never
seen
you
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
good
Lord
,
Clara
!
Think
of
ME
in
evening
suit
at
the
theatre
!
''
he
*NL*
remonstrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
rather
not
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
if
you
WANT
me
to
;
but
I
s
'll
feel
a
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
feel
a
fool
for
my
sake
,
once
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
request
made
his
blood
flush
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
s
'll
have
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
taking
a
suitcase
for
?
''
his
mother
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
blushed
furiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
asked
me
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
seats
are
you
going
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Circle
--
three-and-six
each
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
sure
!
''
exclaimed
his
mother
sarcastically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
once
in
the
bluest
of
blue
moons
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dressed
at
Jordan
's
,
put
on
an
overcoat
and
a
cap
,
and
met
Clara
in
a
*NL*
cafe
.
She
was
with
one
of
her
suffragette
friends
.
She
wore
an
old
long
*NL*
coat
,
which
did
not
suit
her
,
and
had
a
little
wrap
over
her
head
,
which
*NL*
he
hated
.
The
three
went
to
the
theatre
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
took
off
her
coat
on
the
stairs
,
and
he
discovered
she
was
in
a
*NL*
sort
of
semi-evening
dress
,
that
left
her
arms
and
neck
and
part
of
her
*NL*
breast
bare
.
Her
hair
was
done
fashionably
.
The
dress
,
a
simple
thing
*NL*
of
green
crape
,
suited
her
.
She
looked
quite
grand
,
he
thought
.
He
could
*NL*
see
her
figure
inside
the
frock
,
as
if
that
were
wrapped
closely
round
*NL*
her
.
The
firmness
and
the
softness
of
her
upright
body
could
almost
be
*NL*
felt
as
he
looked
at
her
.
He
clenched
his
fists
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
was
to
sit
all
the
evening
beside
her
beautiful
naked
arm
,
*NL*
watching
the
strong
throat
rise
from
the
strong
chest
,
watching
the
*NL*
breasts
under
the
green
stuff
,
the
curve
of
her
limbs
in
the
tight
*NL*
dress
.
Something
in
him
hated
her
again
for
submitting
him
to
this
*NL*
torture
of
nearness
.
And
he
loved
her
as
she
balanced
her
head
and
*NL*
stared
straight
in
front
of
her
,
pouting
,
wistful
,
immobile
,
as
if
she
*NL*
yielded
herself
to
her
fate
because
it
was
too
strong
for
her
.
She
could
*NL*
not
help
herself
;
she
was
in
the
grip
of
something
bigger
than
herself
.
*NL*
A
kind
of
eternal
look
about
her
,
as
if
she
were
a
wistful
sphinx
,
made
*NL*
it
necessary
for
him
to
kiss
her
.
He
dropped
his
programme
,
and
crouched
*NL*
down
on
the
floor
to
get
it
,
so
that
he
could
kiss
her
hand
and
wrist
.
*NL*
Her
beauty
was
a
torture
to
him
.
She
sat
immobile
.
Only
,
when
the
lights
*NL*
went
down
,
she
sank
a
little
against
him
,
and
he
caressed
her
hand
and
*NL*
arm
with
his
fingers
.
He
could
smell
her
faint
perfume
.
All
the
time
*NL*
his
blood
kept
sweeping
up
in
great
white-hot
waves
that
killed
his
*NL*
consciousness
momentarily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drama
continued
.
He
saw
it
all
in
the
distance
,
going
on
somewhere
;
*NL*
he
did
not
know
where
,
but
it
seemed
far
away
inside
him
.
He
was
Clara
's
*NL*
white
heavy
arms
,
her
throat
,
her
moving
bosom
.
That
seemed
to
be
*NL*
himself
.
Then
away
somewhere
the
play
went
on
,
and
he
was
identified
*NL*
with
that
also
.
There
was
no
himself
.
The
grey
and
black
eyes
of
Clara
,
*NL*
her
bosom
coming
down
on
him
,
her
arm
that
he
held
gripped
between
his
*NL*
hands
,
were
all
that
existed
.
Then
he
felt
himself
small
and
helpless
,
*NL*
her
towering
in
her
force
above
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
intervals
,
when
the
lights
came
up
,
hurt
him
expressibly
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
run
anywhere
,
so
long
as
it
would
be
dark
again
.
In
a
maze
,
*NL*
he
wandered
out
for
a
drink
.
Then
the
lights
were
out
,
and
the
strange
,
*NL*
insane
reality
of
Clara
and
the
drama
took
hold
of
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
play
went
on
.
But
he
was
obsessed
by
the
desire
to
kiss
the
tiny
*NL*
blue
vein
that
nestled
in
the
bend
of
her
arm
.
He
could
feel
it
.
His
*NL*
whole
face
seemed
suspended
till
he
had
put
his
lips
there
.
It
must
be
*NL*
done
.
And
the
other
people
!
At
last
he
bent
quickly
forward
and
touched
*NL*
it
with
his
lips
.
His
moustache
brushed
the
sensitive
flesh
.
Clara
*NL*
shivered
,
drew
away
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
all
was
over
,
the
lights
up
,
the
people
clapping
,
he
came
to
*NL*
himself
and
looked
at
his
watch
.
His
train
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
have
to
walk
home
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
late
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
.
Then
he
helped
her
on
with
her
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
!
You
look
beautiful
in
that
dress
,
''
he
murmured
over
her
*NL*
shoulder
,
among
the
throng
of
bustling
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
quiet
.
Together
they
went
out
of
the
theatre
.
He
saw
the
*NL*
cabs
waiting
,
the
people
passing
.
It
seemed
he
met
a
pair
of
brown
*NL*
eyes
which
hated
him
.
But
he
did
not
know
.
He
and
Clara
turned
away
,
*NL*
mechanically
taking
the
direction
to
the
station
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
train
had
gone
.
He
would
have
to
walk
the
ten
miles
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
matter
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
shall
enjoy
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
,
''
she
said
,
flushing
,
``
come
home
for
the
night
?
I
can
sleep
*NL*
with
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
.
Their
eyes
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
your
mother
say
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wo
n't
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
SHALL
I
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
turned
away
.
At
the
first
stopping-place
they
took
the
car
.
The
*NL*
wind
blew
fresh
in
their
faces
.
The
town
was
dark
;
the
tram
tipped
in
*NL*
its
haste
.
He
sat
with
her
hand
fast
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
your
mother
be
gone
to
bed
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
may
be
.
I
hope
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
hurried
along
the
silent
,
dark
little
street
,
the
only
people
out
*NL*
of
doors
.
Clara
quickly
entered
the
house
.
He
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaped
up
the
step
and
was
in
the
room
.
Her
mother
appeared
in
the
*NL*
inner
doorway
,
large
and
hostile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
have
you
got
there
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Mr.
Morel
;
he
has
missed
his
train
.
I
thought
we
might
put
him
up
*NL*
for
the
night
,
and
save
him
a
ten-mile
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
,
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Radford
.
``
That
's
your
lookout
!
If
you
've
invited
*NL*
him
,
he
's
very
welcome
as
far
as
I
'm
concerned
.
YOU
keep
the
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
like
me
,
I
'll
go
away
again
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
you
need
n't
!
Come
along
in
!
I
dunno
what
you
'll
think
of
the
*NL*
supper
I
'd
got
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
little
dish
of
chip
potatoes
and
a
piece
of
bacon
.
The
table
*NL*
was
roughly
laid
for
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
have
some
more
bacon
,
''
continued
Mrs.
Radford
.
``
More
chips
you
*NL*
ca
n't
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
shame
to
bother
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
you
be
apologetic
!
It
does
n't
DO
wi
'
me
!
You
treated
her
to
*NL*
the
theatre
,
did
n't
you
?
''
There
was
a
sarcasm
in
the
last
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
laughed
Paul
uncomfortably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
what
's
an
inch
of
bacon
!
Take
your
coat
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
big
,
straight-standing
woman
was
trying
to
estimate
the
situation
.
*NL*
She
moved
about
the
cupboard
.
Clara
took
his
coat
.
The
room
was
very
*NL*
warm
and
cosy
in
the
lamplight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sirs
!
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Radford
;
``
but
you
two
's
a
pair
of
bright
*NL*
beauties
,
I
must
say
!
What
's
all
that
get-up
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
we
do
n't
know
,
''
he
said
,
feeling
a
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
n't
room
in
THIS
house
for
two
such
bobby-dazzlers
,
if
you
fly
*NL*
your
kites
THAT
high
!
''
she
rallied
them
.
It
was
a
nasty
thrust
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
in
his
dinner
jacket
,
and
Clara
in
her
green
dress
and
bare
arms
,
*NL*
were
confused
.
They
felt
they
must
shelter
each
other
in
that
little
*NL*
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
look
at
THAT
blossom
!
''
continued
Mrs.
Radford
,
pointing
to
Clara
.
*NL*
``
What
does
she
reckon
she
did
it
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
looked
at
Clara
.
She
was
rosy
;
her
neck
was
warm
with
blushes
.
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
of
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
to
see
it
,
do
n't
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
had
them
in
her
power
.
All
the
time
his
heart
was
beating
*NL*
hard
,
and
he
was
tight
with
anxiety
.
But
he
would
fight
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
like
to
see
it
!
''
exclaimed
the
old
woman
.
``
What
should
I
like
to
see
*NL*
her
make
a
fool
of
herself
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
people
look
bigger
fools
,
''
he
said
.
Clara
was
under
his
*NL*
protection
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
ay
!
and
when
was
that
?
''
came
the
sarcastic
rejoinder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
they
made
frights
of
themselves
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Radford
,
large
and
threatening
,
stood
suspended
on
the
hearthrug
,
*NL*
holding
her
fork
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
fools
either
road
,
''
she
answered
at
length
,
turning
to
the
*NL*
Dutch
oven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
,
fighting
stoutly
.
``
Folk
ought
to
look
as
well
as
they
*NL*
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
call
THAT
looking
nice
!
''
cried
the
mother
,
pointing
a
*NL*
scornful
fork
at
Clara
.
``
That
--
that
looks
as
if
it
was
n't
properly
*NL*
dressed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
're
jealous
that
you
ca
n't
swank
as
well
,
''
he
said
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
I
could
have
worn
evening
dress
with
anybody
,
if
I
'd
wanted
to
!
''
*NL*
came
the
scornful
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
did
n't
you
want
to
?
''
he
asked
pertinently
.
``
Or
DID
you
wear
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
pause
.
Mrs.
Radford
readjusted
the
bacon
in
the
Dutch
*NL*
oven
.
His
heart
beat
fast
,
for
fear
he
had
offended
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
''
she
exclaimed
at
last
.
``
No
,
I
did
n't
!
And
when
I
was
in
service
,
*NL*
I
knew
as
soon
as
one
of
the
maids
came
out
in
bare
shoulders
what
sort
*NL*
SHE
was
,
going
to
her
sixpenny
hop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
too
good
to
go
to
a
sixpenny
hop
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
sat
with
bowed
head
.
His
eyes
were
dark
and
glittering
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Radford
took
the
Dutch
oven
from
the
fire
,
and
stood
near
him
,
putting
*NL*
bits
of
bacon
on
his
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
THERE
'S
a
nice
crozzly
bit
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
give
me
the
best
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
SHE
'S
got
what
SHE
wants
,
''
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sort
of
scornful
forbearance
in
the
woman
's
tone
that
made
*NL*
Paul
know
she
was
mollified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
DO
have
some
!
''
he
said
to
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
at
him
with
her
grey
eyes
,
humiliated
and
lonely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
thanks
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
wo
n't
you
?
''
he
answered
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blood
was
beating
up
like
fire
in
his
veins
.
Mrs.
Radford
sat
down
*NL*
again
,
large
and
impressive
and
aloof
.
He
left
Clara
altogether
to
*NL*
attend
to
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
Sarah
Bernhardt
's
fifty
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty
!
She
's
turned
sixty
!
''
came
the
scornful
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
'd
never
think
it
!
She
made
me
want
to
howl
even
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
myself
howling
at
THAT
bad
old
baggage
!
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Radford
.
``
It
's
time
she
began
to
think
herself
a
grandmother
,
not
a
*NL*
shrieking
catamaran
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
catamaran
is
a
boat
the
Malays
use
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
's
a
word
as
I
use
,
''
she
retorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
does
sometimes
,
and
it
's
no
good
my
telling
her
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'd
think
she
boxes
your
ears
,
''
said
Mrs.
Radford
,
good-humouredly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
like
to
,
and
she
says
she
will
,
so
I
give
her
a
little
stool
to
*NL*
stand
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
worst
of
my
mother
,
''
said
Clara
.
``
She
never
wants
a
stool
*NL*
for
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
often
ca
n't
touch
THAT
lady
with
a
long
prop
,
''
retorted
Mrs.
*NL*
Radford
to
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'd
think
she
does
n't
want
touching
with
a
prop
,
''
he
laughed
.
``
I
*NL*
should
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
do
the
pair
of
you
good
to
give
you
a
crack
on
the
head
with
*NL*
one
,
''
said
the
mother
,
laughing
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
you
so
vindictive
towards
me
?
''
he
said
.
``
I
've
not
stolen
*NL*
anything
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
'll
watch
that
,
''
laughed
the
older
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
the
supper
was
finished
.
Mrs.
Radford
sat
guard
in
her
chair
.
Paul
*NL*
lit
a
cigarette
.
Clara
went
upstairs
,
returning
with
a
sleeping-suit
,
*NL*
which
she
spread
on
the
fender
to
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
'd
forgot
all
about
THEM
!
''
said
Mrs.
Radford
.
``
Where
have
they
*NL*
sprung
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
of
my
drawer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
You
bought
'em
for
Baxter
,
an
'
he
would
n't
wear
'em
,
would
*NL*
he
?
''
--
laughing
.
``
Said
he
reckoned
to
do
wi'out
trousers
i
'
bed
.
''
She
*NL*
turned
confidentially
to
Paul
,
saying
:
``
He
could
n't
BEAR
'em
,
them
*NL*
pyjama
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
sat
making
rings
of
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
everyone
to
his
taste
,
''
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
followed
a
little
discussion
of
the
merits
of
pyjamas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
loves
me
in
them
,
''
he
said
.
``
She
says
I
'm
a
pierrot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
imagine
they
'd
suit
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
Radford
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
he
glanced
at
the
little
clock
that
was
ticking
on
the
*NL*
mantelpiece
.
It
was
half-past
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
funny
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
it
takes
hours
to
settle
down
to
sleep
*NL*
after
the
theatre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
about
time
you
did
,
''
said
Mrs.
Radford
,
clearing
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
YOU
tired
?
''
he
asked
of
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
least
bit
,
''
she
answered
,
avoiding
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
have
a
game
at
cribbage
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
forgotten
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
teach
you
again
.
May
we
play
crib
,
Mrs.
Radford
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
please
yourselves
,
''
she
said
;
``
but
it
's
pretty
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
game
or
so
will
make
us
sleepy
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
brought
the
cards
,
and
sat
spinning
her
wedding-ring
whilst
he
*NL*
shuffled
them
.
Mrs.
Radford
was
washing
up
in
the
scullery
.
As
it
grew
*NL*
later
Paul
felt
the
situation
getting
more
and
more
tense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
two
,
fifteen
four
,
fifteen
six
,
and
two
's
eight
--
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
struck
one
.
Still
the
game
continued
.
Mrs.
Radford
had
done
*NL*
all
the
little
jobs
preparatory
to
going
to
bed
,
had
locked
the
door
*NL*
and
filled
the
kettle
.
Still
Paul
went
on
dealing
and
counting
.
He
was
*NL*
obsessed
by
Clara
's
arms
and
throat
.
He
believed
he
could
see
where
the
*NL*
division
was
just
beginning
for
her
breasts
.
He
could
not
leave
her
.
She
*NL*
watched
his
hands
,
and
felt
her
joints
melt
as
they
moved
quickly
.
She
*NL*
was
so
near
;
it
was
almost
as
if
he
touched
her
,
and
yet
not
quite
.
His
*NL*
mettle
was
roused
.
He
hated
Mrs.
Radford
.
She
sat
on
,
nearly
dropping
*NL*
asleep
,
but
determined
and
obstinate
in
her
chair
.
Paul
glanced
at
her
,
*NL*
then
at
Clara
.
She
met
his
eyes
,
that
were
angry
,
mocking
,
and
hard
as
*NL*
steel
.
Her
own
answered
him
in
shame
.
He
knew
SHE
,
at
any
rate
,
was
of
*NL*
his
mind
.
He
played
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Mrs.
Radford
roused
herself
stiffly
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
nigh
on
time
you
two
was
thinking
o
'
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
played
on
without
answering
.
He
hated
her
sufficiently
to
murder
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
a
minute
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
woman
rose
and
sailed
stubbornly
into
the
scullery
,
returning
*NL*
with
his
candle
,
which
she
put
on
the
mantelpiece
.
Then
she
sat
down
*NL*
again
.
The
hatred
of
her
went
so
hot
down
his
veins
,
he
dropped
his
*NL*
cards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
stop
,
then
,
''
he
said
,
but
his
voice
was
still
a
challenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
saw
his
mouth
shut
hard
.
Again
he
glanced
at
her
.
It
seemed
like
*NL*
an
agreement
.
She
bent
over
the
cards
,
coughing
,
to
clear
her
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
glad
you
've
finished
,
''
said
Mrs.
Radford
.
``
Here
,
take
your
*NL*
things
''
--
she
thrust
the
warm
suit
in
his
hand
--
``
and
this
is
your
candle
.
*NL*
Your
room
's
over
this
;
there
's
only
two
,
so
you
ca
n't
go
far
wrong
.
*NL*
Well
,
good-night
.
I
hope
you
'll
rest
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
shall
;
I
always
do
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
so
you
ought
at
your
age
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bade
good-night
to
Clara
,
and
went
.
The
twisting
stairs
of
white
,
*NL*
scrubbed
wood
creaked
and
clanged
at
every
step
.
He
went
doggedly
.
The
*NL*
two
doors
faced
each
other
.
He
went
in
his
room
,
pushed
the
door
to
,
*NL*
without
fastening
the
latch
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
small
room
with
a
large
bed
.
Some
of
Clara
's
hair-pins
were
*NL*
on
the
dressing-table
--
her
hair-brush
.
Her
clothes
and
some
skirts
hung
*NL*
under
a
cloth
in
a
corner
.
There
was
actually
a
pair
of
stockings
over
*NL*
a
chair
.
He
explored
the
room
.
Two
books
of
his
own
were
there
on
the
*NL*
shelf
.
He
undressed
,
folded
his
suit
,
and
sat
on
the
bed
,
listening
.
*NL*
Then
he
blew
out
the
candle
,
lay
down
,
and
in
two
minutes
was
almost
*NL*
asleep
.
Then
click
!
--
he
was
wide
awake
and
writhing
in
torment
.
It
*NL*
was
as
if
,
when
he
had
nearly
got
to
sleep
,
something
had
bitten
him
*NL*
suddenly
and
sent
him
mad
.
He
sat
up
and
looked
at
the
room
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
his
feet
doubled
under
him
,
perfectly
motionless
,
listening
.
*NL*
He
heard
a
cat
somewhere
away
outside
;
then
the
heavy
,
poised
tread
of
*NL*
the
mother
;
then
Clara
's
distinct
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
unfasten
my
dress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
for
some
time
.
At
last
the
mother
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
then
!
are
n't
you
coming
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
yet
,
''
replied
the
daughter
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
then
!
If
it
's
not
late
enough
,
stop
a
bit
longer
.
Only
*NL*
you
need
n't
come
waking
me
up
when
I
've
got
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha
n't
be
long
,
''
said
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
afterwards
Paul
heard
the
mother
slowly
mounting
the
stairs
.
*NL*
The
candlelight
flashed
through
the
cracks
in
his
door
.
Her
dress
*NL*
brushed
the
door
,
and
his
heart
jumped
.
Then
it
was
dark
,
and
he
*NL*
heard
the
clatter
of
her
latch
.
She
was
very
leisurely
indeed
in
her
*NL*
preparations
for
sleep
.
After
a
long
time
it
was
quite
still
.
He
sat
*NL*
strung
up
on
the
bed
,
shivering
slightly
.
His
door
was
an
inch
open
.
*NL*
As
Clara
came
upstairs
,
he
would
intercept
her
.
He
waited
.
All
was
dead
*NL*
silence
.
The
clock
struck
two
.
Then
he
heard
a
slight
scrape
of
the
*NL*
fender
downstairs
.
Now
he
could
not
help
himself
.
His
shivering
was
*NL*
uncontrollable
.
He
felt
he
must
go
or
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
off
the
bed
,
and
stood
a
moment
,
shuddering
.
Then
he
went
*NL*
straight
to
the
door
.
He
tried
to
step
lightly
.
The
first
stair
*NL*
cracked
like
a
shot
.
He
listened
.
The
old
woman
stirred
in
her
bed
.
The
*NL*
staircase
was
dark
.
There
was
a
slit
of
light
under
the
stair-foot
*NL*
door
,
which
opened
into
the
kitchen
.
He
stood
a
moment
.
Then
he
went
on
,
*NL*
mechanically
.
Every
step
creaked
,
and
his
back
was
creeping
,
lest
the
*NL*
old
woman
's
door
should
open
behind
him
up
above
.
He
fumbled
with
the
*NL*
door
at
the
bottom
.
The
latch
opened
with
a
loud
clack
.
He
went
through
*NL*
into
the
kitchen
,
and
shut
the
door
noisily
behind
him
.
The
old
woman
*NL*
dare
n't
come
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
stood
,
arrested
.
Clara
was
kneeling
on
a
pile
of
white
*NL*
underclothing
on
the
hearthrug
,
her
back
towards
him
,
warming
herself
.
*NL*
She
did
not
look
round
,
but
sat
crouching
on
her
heels
,
and
her
rounded
*NL*
beautiful
back
was
towards
him
,
and
her
face
was
hidden
.
She
was
warming
*NL*
her
body
at
the
fire
for
consolation
.
The
glow
was
rosy
on
one
side
,
the
*NL*
shadow
was
dark
and
warm
on
the
other
.
Her
arms
hung
slack
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shuddered
violently
,
clenching
his
teeth
and
fists
hard
to
keep
*NL*
control
.
Then
he
went
forward
to
her
.
He
put
one
hand
on
her
shoulder
,
*NL*
the
fingers
of
the
other
hand
under
her
chin
to
raise
her
face
.
A
*NL*
convulsed
shiver
ran
through
her
,
once
,
twice
,
at
his
touch
.
She
kept
*NL*
her
head
bent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry
!
''
he
murmured
,
realising
that
his
hands
were
very
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
looked
up
at
him
,
frightened
,
like
a
thing
that
is
afraid
of
*NL*
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
hands
are
so
cold
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
it
,
''
she
whispered
,
closing
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
breath
of
her
words
were
on
his
mouth
.
Her
arms
clasped
his
knees
.
*NL*
The
cord
of
his
sleeping-suit
dangled
against
her
and
made
her
shiver
.
*NL*
As
the
warmth
went
into
him
,
his
shuddering
became
less
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
unable
to
stand
so
any
more
,
he
raised
her
,
and
she
buried
*NL*
her
head
on
his
shoulder
.
His
hands
went
over
her
slowly
with
an
*NL*
infinite
tenderness
of
caress
.
She
clung
close
to
him
,
trying
to
hide
*NL*
herself
against
him
.
He
clasped
her
very
fast
.
Then
at
last
she
looked
*NL*
at
him
,
mute
,
imploring
,
looking
to
see
if
she
must
be
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
were
dark
,
very
deep
,
and
very
quiet
.
It
was
as
if
her
beauty
*NL*
and
his
taking
it
hurt
him
,
made
him
sorrowful
.
He
looked
at
her
with
a
*NL*
little
pain
,
and
was
afraid
.
He
was
so
humble
before
her
.
She
kissed
him
*NL*
fervently
on
the
eyes
,
first
one
,
then
the
other
,
and
she
folded
herself
*NL*
to
him
.
She
gave
herself
.
He
held
her
fast
.
It
was
a
moment
intense
*NL*
almost
to
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
letting
him
adore
her
and
tremble
with
joy
of
her
.
It
healed
*NL*
her
hurt
pride
.
It
healed
her
;
it
made
her
glad
.
It
made
her
feel
erect
*NL*
and
proud
again
.
Her
pride
had
been
wounded
inside
her
.
She
had
been
*NL*
cheapened
.
Now
she
radiated
with
joy
and
pride
again
.
It
was
her
*NL*
restoration
and
her
recognition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
looked
at
her
,
his
face
radiant
.
They
laughed
to
each
other
,
*NL*
and
he
strained
her
to
his
chest
.
The
seconds
ticked
off
,
the
minutes
*NL*
passed
,
and
still
the
two
stood
clasped
rigid
together
,
mouth
to
mouth
,
*NL*
like
a
statue
in
one
block
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
again
his
fingers
went
seeking
over
her
,
restless
,
wandering
,
*NL*
dissatisfied
.
The
hot
blood
came
up
wave
upon
wave
.
She
laid
her
head
on
*NL*
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
you
to
my
room
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
,
her
mouth
pouting
disconsolately
,
*NL*
her
eyes
heavy
with
passion
.
He
watched
her
fixedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
still
heavily
,
sorrowfully
,
and
again
she
shook
her
*NL*
head
.
His
eyes
hardened
,
and
he
gave
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
later
on
,
he
was
back
in
bed
,
he
wondered
why
she
had
refused
to
*NL*
come
to
him
openly
,
so
that
her
mother
would
know
.
At
any
rate
,
then
*NL*
things
would
have
been
definite
.
And
she
could
have
stayed
with
him
the
*NL*
night
,
without
having
to
go
,
as
she
was
,
to
her
mother
's
bed
.
It
was
*NL*
strange
,
and
he
could
not
understand
it
.
And
then
almost
immediately
he
*NL*
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
awoke
in
the
morning
with
someone
speaking
to
him
.
Opening
his
eyes
,
*NL*
he
saw
Mrs.
Radford
,
big
and
stately
,
looking
down
on
him
.
She
held
a
*NL*
cup
of
tea
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
you
're
going
to
sleep
till
Doomsday
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ought
only
to
be
about
five
o'clock
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
she
answered
,
``
it
's
half-past
seven
,
whether
or
not
.
Here
,
I
've
*NL*
brought
you
a
cup
of
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rubbed
his
face
,
pushed
the
tumbled
hair
off
his
forehead
,
and
roused
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
it
so
late
for
!
''
he
grumbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
resented
being
wakened
.
It
amused
her
.
She
saw
his
neck
in
the
*NL*
flannel
sleeping-jacket
,
as
white
and
round
as
a
girl
's
.
He
rubbed
his
*NL*
hair
crossly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
good
your
scratching
your
head
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
wo
n't
make
it
no
*NL*
earlier
.
Here
,
an
'
how
long
d'you
think
I
'm
going
to
stand
waiting
wi
'
*NL*
this
here
cup
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dash
the
cup
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
go
to
bed
earlier
,
''
said
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
at
her
,
laughing
with
impudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
bed
before
YOU
did
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
Guyney
,
you
did
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fancy
,
''
he
said
,
stirring
his
tea
,
``
having
tea
brought
to
bed
to
me
!
My
*NL*
mother
'll
think
I
'm
ruined
for
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
she
never
do
it
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Radford
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
as
leave
think
of
flying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
always
spoilt
my
lot
!
That
's
why
they
've
turned
out
such
bad
*NL*
uns
,
''
said
the
elderly
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
only
Clara
,
''
he
said
.
``
And
Mr.
Radford
's
in
heaven
.
So
I
suppose
*NL*
there
's
only
you
left
to
be
the
bad
un
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
bad
;
I
'm
only
soft
,
''
she
said
,
as
she
went
out
of
the
bedroom
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
only
a
fool
,
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
was
very
quiet
at
breakfast
,
but
she
had
a
sort
of
air
of
*NL*
proprietorship
over
him
that
pleased
him
infinitely
.
Mrs.
Radford
was
*NL*
evidently
fond
of
him
.
He
began
to
talk
of
his
painting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
good
,
''
exclaimed
the
mother
,
``
of
your
whittling
and
worrying
*NL*
and
twistin
'
and
too-in

at
that
painting
of
yours

What
GOOD
does
it
do
*NL*
you
,
I
should
like
to
know

You
'd
better
be
enjoyin

yourself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
,
''
exclaimed
Paul
,
``
I
made
over
thirty
guineas
last
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
!
Well
,
that
's
a
consideration
,
but
it
's
nothing

the
time

put
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
've
got

A

he

give
me
five

I
'd
paint
him
and
his
missis

the
dog

cottage

And
I
went
and
*NL*
put
the
fowls
in
instead
of

dog

and
he
was
waxy
,
so
I
had
to

knock
a
quid
off

I
was
sick
of
it

and
I
did
n't
like

I
made
a

Mrs.

half-wrathful

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
BAXTER
DAWES
*NL*
*NL*
SOON
after
Paul
had
been
to
the
theatre
with
Clara
,
he
was
drinking
*NL*
in
the
Punch
Bowl
with
some
friends
of
his
when
Dawes
came
in
.
Clara
's
*NL*
husband
was
growing
stout
;
his
eyelids
were
getting
slack
over
his
brown
*NL*
eyes
;
he
was
losing
his
healthy
firmness
of
flesh
.
He
was
very
evidently
*NL*
on
the
downward
track
.
Having
quarrelled
with
his
sister
,
he
had
gone
*NL*
into
cheap
lodgings
.
His
mistress
had
left
him
for
a
man
who
would
marry
*NL*
her
.
He
had
been
in
prison
one
night
for
fighting
when
he
was
drunk
,
and
*NL*
there
was
a
shady
betting
episode
in
which
he
was
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
and
he
were
confirmed
enemies
,
and
yet
there
was
between
them
that
*NL*
peculiar
feeling
of
intimacy
,
as
if
they
were
secretly
near
to
each
*NL*
other
,
which
sometimes
exists
between
two
people
,
although
they
never
*NL*
speak
to
one
another
.
Paul
often
thought
of
Baxter
Dawes
,
often
wanted
*NL*
to
get
at
him
and
be
friends
with
him
.
He
knew
that
Dawes
often
thought
*NL*
about
him
,
and
that
the
man
was
drawn
to
him
by
some
bond
or
other
.
And
*NL*
yet
the
two
never
looked
at
each
other
save
in
hostility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
he
was
a
superior
employee
at
Jordan
's
,
it
was
the
thing
for
Paul
*NL*
to
offer
Dawes
a
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
'll
you
have
?
''
he
asked
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nowt
wi
'
a
bleeder
like
you
!
''
replied
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
turned
away
with
a
slight
disdainful
movement
of
the
shoulders
,
*NL*
very
irritating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
aristocracy
,
''
he
continued
,
``
is
really
a
military
institution
.
Take
*NL*
Germany
,
now
.
She
's
got
thousands
of
aristocrats
whose
only
means
of
*NL*
existence
is
the
army
.
They
're
deadly
poor
,
and
life
's
deadly
slow
.
So
*NL*
they
hope
for
a
war
.
They
look
for
war
as
a
chance
of
getting
on
.
Till
*NL*
there
's
a
war
they
are
idle
good-for-nothings
.
When
there
's
a
war
,
they
*NL*
are
leaders
and
commanders
.
There
you
are
,
then
--
they
WANT
war
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
a
favourite
debater
in
the
public-house
,
being
too
quick
and
*NL*
overbearing
.
He
irritated
the
older
men
by
his
assertive
manner
,
and
*NL*
his
cocksureness
.
They
listened
in
silence
,
and
were
not
sorry
when
he
*NL*
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
interrupted
the
young
man
's
flow
of
eloquence
by
asking
,
in
a
loud
*NL*
sneer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
learn
all
that
at
th
'
theatre
th
'
other
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
looked
at
him
;
their
eyes
met
.
Then
he
knew
Dawes
had
seen
him
*NL*
coming
out
of
the
theatre
with
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
about
th
'
theatre
?
''
asked
one
of
Paul
's
associates
,
glad
to
*NL*
get
a
dig
at
the
young
fellow
,
and
sniffing
something
tasty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
him
in
a
bob-tailed
evening
suit
,
on
the
lardy-da
!
''
sneered
Dawes
,
*NL*
jerking
his
head
contemptuously
at
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
comin
'
it
strong
,
''
said
the
mutual
friend
.
``
Tart
an
'
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tart
,
begod
!
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
;
let
's
have
it
!
''
cried
the
mutual
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
it
,
''
said
Dawes
,
``
an
'
I
reckon
Morelly
had
it
an
'
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
be
jiggered
!
''
said
the
mutual
friend
.
``
An
'
was
it
a
proper
*NL*
tart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tart
,
God
blimey
--
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
said
Dawes
,
``
I
reckon
he
spent
th
'
night
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
good
deal
of
laughter
at
Paul
's
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
WAS
she
?
D'you
know
her
?
''
asked
the
mutual
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
SHAY
SHO
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
brought
another
burst
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
spit
it
out
,
''
said
the
mutual
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
shook
his
head
,
and
took
a
gulp
of
beer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
wonder
he
has
n't
let
on
himself

''
he
said
.
``
He
'll

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

said
the

You
might
just

own
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Own
up

*NL*
``
Oh

if
it
was
all
right

tell

said
the

friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
WAS
all
right
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
furious
.
Dawes
wiped
his
golden
moustache
with
his
fingers
,
*NL*
sneering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strike
me
--
!
One
o
'
that
sort
?
''
said
the
mutual
friend
.
``
Paul
,
boy
,
I
'm
*NL*
surprised
at
you
.
And
do
you
know
her
,
Baxter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
bit
,
like
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
winked
at
the
other
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
I
'll
be
going
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mutual
friend
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
do
n't
get
off
as
easy
as
that
,
my
lad
.
We
've
got
to
*NL*
have
a
full
account
of
this
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
get
it
from
Dawes
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
funk
your
own
deeds
,
man
,
''
remonstrated
the
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Dawes
made
a
remark
which
caused
Paul
to
throw
half
a
glass
of
beer
*NL*
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Morel
!
''
cried
the
barmaid
,
and
she
rang
the
bell
for
the
*NL*
``
chucker-out
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
spat
and
rushed
for
the
young
man
.
At
that
minute
a
brawny
*NL*
fellow
with
his
shirt-sleeves
rolled
up
and
his
trousers
tight
over
his
*NL*
haunches
intervened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
!
''
he
said
,
pushing
his
chest
in
front
of
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
out
!
''
cried
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
leaning
,
white
and
quivering
,
against
the
brass
rail
of
the
*NL*
bar
.
He
hated
Dawes
,
wished
something
could
exterminate
him
at
that
*NL*
minute
;
and
at
the
same
time
,
seeing
the
wet
hair
on
the
man
's
forehead
,
*NL*
he
thought
he
looked
pathetic
.
He
did
not
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
out
,
you
--
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
,
Dawes
,
''
cried
the
barmaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
,
''
said
the
``
chucker-out
''
,
with
kindly
insistence
,
``
you
'd
better
*NL*
be
getting
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
by
making
Dawes
edge
away
from
his
own
close
proximity
,
he
worked
*NL*
him
to
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
THAT
'S
the
little
sod
as
started
it
!
''
cried
Dawes
,
half-cowed
,
pointing
*NL*
to
Paul
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
a
story
,
Mr.
Dawes
!
''
said
the
barmaid
.
``
You
know
it
was
you
*NL*
all
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
``
chucker-out
''
kept
thrusting
his
chest
forward
at
him
,
still
*NL*
he
kept
edging
back
,
until
he
was
in
the
doorway
and
on
the
steps
*NL*
outside
;
then
he
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
said
,
nodding
straight
at
his
rival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
had
a
curious
sensation
of
pity
,
almost
of
affection
,
mingled
with
*NL*
violent
hate
,
for
the
man
.
The
coloured
door
swung
to
;
there
was
silence
*NL*
in
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Serve
,
him
,
jolly
well
right
!
''
said
the
barmaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
a
nasty
thing
to
get
a
glass
of
beer
in
your
eyes
,
''
said
the
*NL*
mutual
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
I
was
glad
he
did
,
''
said
the
barmaid
.
``
Will
you
have
*NL*
another
,
Mr.
Morel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
up
Paul
's
glass
questioningly
.
He
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
man
as
does
n't
care
for
anything
,
is
Baxter
Dawes
,
''
said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
is
he
?
''
said
the
barmaid
.
``
He
's
a
loud-mouthed
one
,
he
is
,
and
*NL*
they
're
never
much
good
.
Give
me
a
pleasant-spoken
chap
,
if
you
want
a
*NL*
devil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Paul
,
my
lad
,
''
said
the
friend
,
``
you
'll
have
to
take
care
of
*NL*
yourself
now
for
a
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
have
to
give
him
a
chance
over
you
,
that
's
all
,
''
said
the
*NL*
barmaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
box
?
''
asked
a
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
,
''
he
answered
,
still
very
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
give
you
a
turn
or
two
,
''
said
the
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
I
have
n't
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
presently
he
took
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
with
him
,
Mr.
Jenkinson
,
''
whispered
the
barmaid
,
tipping
Mr.
*NL*
Jenkinson
the
wink
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
nodded
,
took
his
hat
,
said
:
``
Good-night
all
!
''
very
heartily
,
and
*NL*
followed
Paul
,
calling
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
a
minute
,
old
man
.
You
an
'
me
's
going
the
same
road
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Morel
does
n't
like
it
,
''
said
the
barmaid
.
``
You
'll
see
,
we
sha
n't
*NL*
have
him
in
much
more
.
I
'm
sorry
;
he
's
good
company
.
And
Baxter
Dawes
*NL*
wants
locking
up
,
that
's
what
he
wants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
would
have
died
rather
than
his
mother
should
get
to
know
of
this
*NL*
affair
.
He
suffered
tortures
of
humiliation
and
self-consciousness
.
*NL*
There
was
now
a
good
deal
of
his
life
of
which
necessarily
he
could
not
*NL*
speak
to
his
mother
.
He
had
a
life
apart
from
her
--
his
sexual
life
.
The
*NL*
rest
she
still
kept
.
But
he
felt
he
had
to
conceal
something
from
her
,
*NL*
and
it
irked
him
.
There
was
a
certain
silence
between
them
,
and
he
*NL*
felt
he
had
,
in
that
silence
,
to
defend
himself
against
her
;
he
felt
*NL*
condemned
by
her
.
Then
sometimes
he
hated
her
,
and
pulled
at
her
*NL*
bondage
.
His
life
wanted
to
free
itself
of
her
.
It
was
like
a
circle
*NL*
where
life
turned
back
on
itself
,
and
got
no
farther
.
She
bore
him
,
*NL*
loved
him
,
kept
him
,
and
his
love
turned
back
into
her
,
so
that
he
could
*NL*
not
be
free
to
go
forward
with
his
own
life
,
really
love
another
woman
.
*NL*
At
this
period
,
unknowingly
,
he
resisted
his
mother
's
influence
.
He
did
*NL*
not
tell
her
things
;
there
was
a
distance
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
was
happy
,
almost
sure
of
him
.
She
felt
she
had
at
last
got
him
*NL*
for
herself
;
and
then
again
came
the
uncertainty
.
He
told
her
jestingly
*NL*
of
the
affair
with
her
husband
.
Her
colour
came
up
,
her
grey
eyes
*NL*
flashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
him
to
a
`
T
'
,
''
she
cried
--
``
like
a
navvy
!
He
's
not
fit
for
mixing
*NL*
with
decent
folk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
you
married
him
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
her
furious
that
he
reminded
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
!
''
she
cried
.
``
But
how
was
I
to
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
might
have
been
rather
nice
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
I
made
him
what
he
is
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
he
made
himself
.
But
there
's
something
about
him
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
looked
at
her
lover
closely
.
There
was
something
in
him
she
hated
,
*NL*
a
sort
of
detached
criticism
of
herself
,
a
coldness
which
made
her
*NL*
woman
's
soul
harden
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
you
going
to
do
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Baxter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
to
do
,
is
there
?
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
fight
him
if
you
have
to
,
I
suppose
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
have
n't
the
least
sense
of
the
`
fist
'
.
It
's
funny
.
With
most
men
*NL*
there
's
the
instinct
to
clench
the
fist
and
hit
.
It
's
not
so
with
me
.
I
*NL*
should
want
a
knife
or
a
pistol
or
something
to
fight
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
'd
better
carry
something
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
he
laughed
;
``
I
'm
not
daggeroso
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
'll
do
something
to
you
.
You
do
n't
know
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
he
said
,
``
we
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
'll
let
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
if
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
he
kills
you
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
sorry
,
for
his
sake
and
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
was
silent
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
DO
make
me
angry
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nothing
afresh
,
''
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are
you
so
silly
?
You
do
n't
know
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
want

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
're
not
going
to
let
a
man
do
as
he
likes
with
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
must
I
do
?
''
he
replied
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
carry
a
revolver
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
'm
sure
he
's
dangerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
blow
my
fingers
off

he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
wo
n't
you

''
she
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
anything

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Yes

``
You

She
set
her
teeth
with
anger

she
cried

trembling
with

she
exclaimed

low
and
indignant

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ought

to
slay
him
to
please

he
said

pause

he
quoted

She
looked
at

searchingly

he
laughed

*NL*
She
bowed
her
head

brooding

*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
see
Dawes
for
several
days
;
then
one
morning
as
he
ran
*NL*
upstairs
from
the
Spiral
room
he
almost
collided
with
the
burly
*NL*
metal-worker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

cried
the
smith

passed
on

*NL*
``
SORRY

Dawes

Paul
whistled
lightly
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll

The

took
no
notice

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
to
his
desk
in
his
corner
,
and
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
*NL*
ledger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

tell
Fanny
I
want

he
said
to
his
boy

*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
stood
in
the
doorway
,
tall
and
threatening
,
looking
at
the
top
of
*NL*
the
young
man
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six

five

added
aloud

*NL*

wrote
a
figure

said

I

going

the

The

went
on
adding
the

aloud

*NL*
*NL*
Paul
quickly
snatched
the
heavy
ruler
.
Dawes
started
.
The
young
man
*NL*
ruled
some
lines
in
his
ledger
.
The
elder
man
was
infuriated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

I

yer
little
swine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
the
smith
started
heavily
from
the
doorway
.
Just
then
a
whistle
*NL*
piped
shrilly
.
Paul
went
to
the
speaking-tube
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
he
said
,
and
he
listened
.
``
Er
--
yes
!
''
He
listened
,
then
he
*NL*
laughed
.
``
I
'll
come
down
directly
.
I
've
got
a
visitor
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
knew
from
his
tone
that
he
had
been
speaking
to
Clara
.
He
stepped
*NL*
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yer
little
devil
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
visitor
you
,
inside
of
two
minutes
!
*NL*
Think
I
'm
goin
'
to
have
YOU
whipperty-snappin
'
round
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
clerks
in
the
warehouse
looked
up
.
Paul
's
office-boy
appeared
,
*NL*
holding
some
white
article
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
says
you
could
have
had
it
last
night
if
you
'd
let
her
know
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
answered
Paul
,
looking
at
the
stocking
.
``
Get
it
off
.
''
Dawes
*NL*
stood
frustrated
,
helpless
with
rage
.
Morel
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
a
minute
,
''
he
said
to
Dawes
,
and
he
would
have
run
*NL*
downstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
God
,
I
'll
stop
your
gallop
!
''
shouted
the
smith
,
seizing
him
by
the
*NL*
arm
.
He
turned
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
!
Hey
!
''
cried
the
office-boy
,
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomas
Jordan
started
out
of
his
little
glass
office
,
and
came
running
*NL*
down
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a-matter
,
what
's
a-matter
?
''
he
said
,
in
his
old
man
's
sharp
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
just
goin
'
ter
settle
this
little
--
,
that
's
all
,
''
said
Dawes
*NL*
desperately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
snapped
Thomas
Jordan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
say
,
''
said
Dawes
,
but
he
hung
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
was
leaning
against
the
counter
,
ashamed
,
half-grinning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
it
all
about
?
''
snapped
Thomas
Jordan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
say
,
''
said
Paul
,
shaking
his
head
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
yer
,
could
n't
yer
!
''
cried
Dawes
,
thrusting
forward
his
*NL*
handsome
,
furious
face
,
and
squaring
his
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
finished
?
''
cried
the
old
man
,
strutting
.
``
Get
off
about
your
*NL*
business
,
and
do
n't
come
here
tipsy
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
turned
his
big
frame
slowly
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tipsy
!
''
he
said
.
``
Who
's
tipsy
?
I
'm
no
more
tipsy
than
YOU
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
heard
that
song
before
,
''
snapped
the
old
man
.
``
Now
you
get
off
,
*NL*
and
do
n't
be
long
about
it
.
Comin
'
HERE
with
your
rowdying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
smith
looked
down
contemptuously
on
his
employer
.
His
hands
,
large
,
*NL*
and
grimy
,
and
yet
well
shaped
for
his
labour
,
worked
restlessly
.
Paul
*NL*
remembered
they
were
the
hands
of
Clara
's
husband
,
and
a
flash
of
hate
*NL*
went
through
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
before
you
're
turned
out
!
''
snapped
Thomas
Jordan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
who
'll
turn
me
out
?
''
said
Dawes
,
beginning
to
sneer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Jordan
started
,
marched
up
to
the
smith
,
waving
him
off
,
thrusting
*NL*
his
stout
little
figure
at
the
man
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
off
my
premises
--
get
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
and
twitched
Dawes
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
off
!
''
said
the
smith
,
and
with
a
jerk
of
the
elbow
he
sent
the
*NL*
little
manufacturer
staggering
backwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
anyone
could
help
him
,
Thomas
Jordan
had
collided
with
the
flimsy
*NL*
spring-door
.
It
had
given
way
,
and
let
him
crash
down
the
half-dozen
*NL*
steps
into
Fanny
's
room
.
There
was
a
second
of
amazement
;
then
men
and
*NL*
girls
were
running
.
Dawes
stood
a
moment
looking
bitterly
on
the
scene
,
*NL*
then
he
took
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thomas
Jordan
was
shaken
and
braised
,
not
otherwise
hurt
.
He
was
,
*NL*
however
,
beside
himself
with
rage
.
He
dismissed
Dawes
from
his
*NL*
employment
,
and
summoned
him
for
assault
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
trial
Paul
Morel
had
to
give
evidence
.
Asked
how
the
trouble
*NL*
began
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dawes
took
occasion
to
insult
Mrs.
Dawes
and
me
because
I
accompanied
*NL*
her
to
the
theatre
one
evening
;
then
I
threw
some
beer
at
him
,
and
he
*NL*
wanted
his
revenge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Cherchez
la
femme
!
_
''
smiled
the
magistrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
was
dismissed
after
the
magistrate
had
told
Dawes
he
thought
*NL*
him
a
skunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
gave
the
case
away
,
''
snapped
Mr.
Jordan
to
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
did
,
''
replied
the
latter
.
``
Besides
,
you
did
n't
really
*NL*
want
a
conviction
,
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
I
took
the
case
up
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
I
'm
sorry
if
I
said
the
wrong
thing
.
''
Clara
was
also
*NL*
very
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
need
MY
name
have
been
dragged
in
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
speak
it
openly
than
leave
it
to
be
whispered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
need
for
anything
at
all
,
''
she
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
none
the
poorer
,
''
he
said
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
YOU
may
not
be
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
never
have
been
mentioned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
,
''
he
said
;
but
he
did
not
sound
sorry
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
himself
easily
:
``
She
will
come
round
.
''
And
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
his
mother
about
the
fall
of
Mr.
Jordan
and
the
trial
of
Dawes
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
watched
him
closely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
?
''
she
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
's
a
fool
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
very
uncomfortable
,
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
considered
where
it
will
end
?
''
his
mother
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
;
``
things
work
out
of
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
,
in
a
way
one
does
n't
like
,
as
a
rule
,
''
said
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
one
has
to
put
up
with
them
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
find
you
're
not
as
good
at
`
putting
up
'
as
you
imagine
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
working
rapidly
at
his
design
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
ever
ask
HER
opinion
?
''
she
said
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
you
,
and
the
whole
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
what
her
opinion
of
me
is
.
She
's
fearfully
in
love
with
*NL*
me
,
but
it
's
not
very
deep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
quite
as
deep
as
your
feeling
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
at
his
mother
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
know
,
mother
,
I
think
there
must
be
something
the
*NL*
matter
with
me
,
that
I
CA
N'T
love
.
When
she
's
there
,
as
a
rule
,
I
DO
*NL*
love
her
.
Sometimes
,
when
I
see
her
just
as
THE
WOMAN
,
I
love
her
,
*NL*
mother
;
but
then
,
when
she
talks
and
criticises
,
I
often
do
n't
listen
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
she
's
as
much
sense
as
Miriam
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
;
and
I
love
her
better
than
Miriam
.
But
WHY
do
n't
they
hold
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
question
was
almost
a
lamentation
.
His
mother
turned
away
her
*NL*
face
,
sat
looking
across
the
room
,
very
quiet
,
grave
,
with
something
of
*NL*
renunciation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
would
n't
want
to
marry
Clara
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
at
first
perhaps
I
would
.
But
why
--
why
do
n't
I
want
to
marry
her
or
*NL*
anybody
?
I
feel
sometimes
as
if
I
wronged
my
women
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
wronged
them
,
my
son
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
painting
rather
despairingly
;
he
had
touched
the
quick
of
the
*NL*
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
for
wanting
to
marry
,
''
said
his
mother
,
``
there
's
plenty
of
time
*NL*
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
,
mother
.
I
even
love
Clara
,
and
I
did
Miriam
;
but
to
GIVE
myself
*NL*
to
them
in
marriage
I
could
n't
.
I
could
n't
belong
to
them
.
They
seem
to
*NL*
want
ME
,
and
I
ca
n't
ever
give
it
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
met
the
right
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
never
shall
meet
the
right
woman
while
you
live
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
quiet
.
Now
she
began
to
feel
again
tired
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
see
,
my
son
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
feeling
that
things
were
going
in
a
circle
made
him
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
was
,
indeed
,
passionately
in
love
with
him
,
and
he
with
her
,
as
*NL*
far
as
passion
went
.
In
the
daytime
he
forgot
her
a
good
deal
.
She
was
*NL*
working
in
the
same
building
,
but
he
was
not
aware
of
it
.
He
was
busy
,
*NL*
and
her
existence
was
of
no
matter
to
him
.
But
all
the
time
she
was
in
*NL*
her
Spiral
room
she
had
a
sense
that
he
was
upstairs
,
a
physical
sense
*NL*
of
his
person
in
the
same
building
.
Every
second
she
expected
him
to
*NL*
come
through
the
door
,
and
when
he
came
it
was
a
shock
to
her
.
But
he
*NL*
was
often
short
and
offhand
with
her
.
He
gave
her
his
directions
in
an
*NL*
official
manner
,
keeping
her
at
bay
.
With
what
wits
she
had
left
she
*NL*
listened
to
him
.
She
dared
not
misunderstand
or
fail
to
remember
,
but
*NL*
it
was
a
cruelty
to
her
.
She
wanted
to
touch
his
chest
.
She
knew
exactly
*NL*
how
his
breast
was
shapen
under
the
waistcoat
,
and
she
wanted
to
touch
*NL*
it
.
It
maddened
her
to
hear
his
mechanical
voice
giving
orders
about
*NL*
the
work
.
She
wanted
to
break
through
the
sham
of
it
,
smash
the
trivial
*NL*
coating
of
business
which
covered
him
with
hardness
,
get
at
the
man
*NL*
again
;
but
she
was
afraid
,
and
before
she
could
feel
one
touch
of
his
*NL*
warmth
he
was
gone
,
and
she
ached
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
that
she
was
dreary
every
evening
she
did
not
see
him
,
so
he
*NL*
gave
her
a
good
deal
of
his
time
.
The
days
were
often
a
misery
to
her
,
*NL*
but
the
evenings
and
the
nights
were
usually
a
bliss
to
them
both
.
Then
*NL*
they
were
silent
.
For
hours
they
sat
together
,
or
walked
together
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
and
talked
only
a
few
,
almost
meaningless
words
.
But
he
had
her
*NL*
hand
in
his
,
and
her
bosom
left
its
warmth
in
his
chest
,
making
him
feel
*NL*
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
they
were
walking
down
by
the
canal
,
and
something
was
*NL*
troubling
him
.
She
knew
she
had
not
got
him
.
All
the
time
he
whistled
*NL*
softly
and
persistently
to
himself
.
She
listened
,
feeling
she
could
*NL*
learn
more
from
his
whistling
than
from
his
speech
.
It
was
a
sad
*NL*
dissatisfied
tune
--
a
tune
that
made
her
feel
he
would
not
stay
with
her
.
*NL*
She
walked
on
in
silence
.
When
they
came
to
the
swing
bridge
he
sat
down
*NL*
on
the
great
pole
,
looking
at
the
stars
in
the
water
.
He
was
a
long
way
*NL*
from
her
.
She
had
been
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
always
stay
at
Jordan
's
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
without
reflecting
.
``
No
;
I
s
'll
leave
Nottingham
and
*NL*
go
abroad
--
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
abroad
!
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dunno
!
I
feel
restless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
shall
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
to
get
some
steady
designing
work
,
and
some
sort
of
sale
*NL*
for
my
pictures
first
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
am
gradually
making
my
way
.
I
know
I
*NL*
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
do
you
think
you
'll
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
shall
hardly
go
for
long
,
while
there
's
my
mother
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
n't
leave
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
the
stars
in
the
black
water
.
They
lay
very
white
and
*NL*
staring
.
It
was
an
agony
to
know
he
would
leave
her
,
but
it
was
almost
*NL*
an
agony
to
have
him
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
you
made
a
nice
lot
of
money
,
what
would
you
do
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
somewhere
in
a
pretty
house
near
London
with
my
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
still
come
and
see
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Do
n't
ask
me
*NL*
what
I
should
do
;
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
.
The
stars
shuddered
and
broke
upon
the
water
.
There
*NL*
came
a
breath
of
wind
.
He
went
suddenly
to
her
,
and
put
his
hand
on
her
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ask
me
anything
about
the
future
,
''
he
said
miserably
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
anything
.
Be
with
me
now
,
will
you
,
no
matter
what
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
took
him
in
her
arms
.
After
all
,
she
was
a
married
woman
,
and
*NL*
she
had
no
right
even
to
what
he
gave
her
.
He
needed
her
badly
.
She
had
*NL*
him
in
her
arms
,
and
he
was
miserable
.
With
her
warmth
she
folded
*NL*
him
over
,
consoled
him
,
loved
him
.
She
would
let
the
moment
stand
for
*NL*
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
he
lifted
his
head
as
if
he
wanted
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clara
,
''
he
said
,
struggling
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
caught
him
passionately
to
her
,
pressed
his
head
down
on
her
breast
*NL*
with
her
hand
.
She
could
not
bear
the
suffering
in
his
voice
.
She
was
*NL*
afraid
in
her
soul
.
He
might
have
anything
of
her
--
anything
;
but
she
did
*NL*
not
want
to
KNOW
.
She
felt
she
could
not
bear
it
.
She
wanted
him
to
be
*NL*
soothed
upon
her
--
soothed
.
She
stood
clasping
him
and
caressing
him
,
and
*NL*
he
was
something
unknown
to
her
--
something
almost
uncanny
.
She
wanted
to
*NL*
soothe
him
into
forgetfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
soon
the
struggle
went
down
in
his
soul
,
and
he
forgot
.
But
then
*NL*
Clara
was
not
there
for
him
,
only
a
woman
,
warm
,
something
he
loved
*NL*
and
almost
worshipped
,
there
in
the
dark
.
But
it
was
not
Clara
,
and
she
*NL*
submitted
to
him
.
The
naked
hunger
and
inevitability
of
his
loving
her
,
*NL*
something
strong
and
blind
and
ruthless
in
its
primitiveness
,
made
the
*NL*
hour
almost
terrible
to
her
.
She
knew
how
stark
and
alone
he
was
,
and
*NL*
she
felt
it
was
great
that
he
came
to
her
;
and
she
took
him
simply
*NL*
because
his
need
was
bigger
either
than
her
or
him
,
and
her
soul
was
*NL*
still
within
her
.
She
did
this
for
him
in
his
need
,
even
if
he
left
her
,
*NL*
for
she
loved
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
while
the
peewits
were
screaming
in
the
field
.
When
he
came
to
,
*NL*
he
wondered
what
was
near
his
eyes
,
curving
and
strong
with
life
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
and
what
voice
it
was
speaking
.
Then
he
realised
it
was
the
grass
,
*NL*
and
the
peewit
was
calling
.
The
warmth
was
Clara
's
breathing
heaving
.
*NL*
He
lifted
his
head
,
and
looked
into
her
eyes
.
They
were
dark
and
shining
*NL*
and
strange
,
life
wild
at
the
source
staring
into
his
life
,
stranger
to
*NL*
him
,
yet
meeting
him
;
and
he
put
his
face
down
on
her
throat
,
afraid
.
*NL*
What
was
she
?
A
strong
,
strange
,
wild
life
,
that
breathed
with
his
*NL*
in
the
darkness
through
this
hour
.
It
was
all
so
much
bigger
than
*NL*
themselves
that
he
was
hushed
.
They
had
met
,
and
included
in
their
*NL*
meeting
the
thrust
of
the
manifold
grass
stems
,
the
cry
of
the
peewit
,
*NL*
the
wheel
of
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
stood
up
they
saw
other
lovers
stealing
down
the
opposite
*NL*
hedge
.
It
seemed
natural
they
were
there
;
the
night
contained
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
such
an
evening
they
both
were
very
still
,
having
known
*NL*
the
immensity
of
passion
.
They
felt
small
,
half-afraid
,
childish
and
*NL*
wondering
,
like
Adam
and
Eve
when
they
lost
their
innocence
and
realised
*NL*
the
magnificence
of
the
power
which
drove
them
out
of
Paradise
and
*NL*
across
the
great
night
and
the
great
day
of
humanity
.
It
was
for
each
of
*NL*
them
an
initiation
and
a
satisfaction
.
To
know
their
own
nothingness
,
*NL*
to
know
the
tremendous
living
flood
which
carried
them
always
,
gave
them
*NL*
rest
within
themselves
.
If
so
great
a
magnificent
power
could
overwhelm
*NL*
them
,
identify
them
altogether
with
itself
,
so
that
they
knew
they
were
*NL*
only
grains
in
the
tremendous
heave
that
lifted
every
grass
blade
its
*NL*
little
height
,
and
every
tree
,
and
living
thing
,
then
why
fret
about
*NL*
themselves
?
They
could
let
themselves
be
carried
by
life
,
and
they
felt
*NL*
a
sort
of
peace
each
in
the
other
.
There
was
a
verification
which
they
*NL*
had
had
together
.
Nothing
could
nullify
it
,
nothing
could
take
it
away
;
*NL*
it
was
almost
their
belief
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Clara
was
not
satisfied
.
Something
great
was
there
,
she
knew
;
*NL*
something
great
enveloped
her
.
But
it
did
not
keep
her
.
In
the
morning
*NL*
it
was
not
the
same
.
They
had
KNOWN
,
but
she
could
not
keep
the
moment
.
*NL*
She
wanted
it
again
;
she
wanted
something
permanent
.
She
had
not
*NL*
realised
fully
.
She
thought
it
was
he
whom
she
wanted
.
He
was
not
safe
*NL*
to
her
.
This
that
had
been
between
them
might
never
be
again
;
he
might
*NL*
leave
her
.
She
had
not
got
him
;
she
was
not
satisfied
.
She
had
been
*NL*
there
,
but
she
had
not
gripped
the
--
the
something
--
she
knew
not
*NL*
what
--
which
she
was
mad
to
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
he
had
considerable
peace
,
and
was
happy
in
himself
.
It
*NL*
seemed
almost
as
if
he
had
known
the
baptism
of
fire
in
passion
,
and
it
*NL*
left
him
at
rest
.
But
it
was
not
Clara
.
It
was
something
that
happened
*NL*
because
of
her
,
but
it
was
not
her
.
They
were
scarcely
any
nearer
each
*NL*
other
.
It
was
as
if
they
had
been
blind
agents
of
a
great
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
saw
him
that
day
at
the
factory
her
heart
melted
like
a
drop
of
*NL*
fire
.
It
was
his
body
,
his
brows
.
The
drop
of
fire
grew
more
intense
*NL*
in
her
breast
;
she
must
hold
him
.
But
he
,
very
quiet
,
very
subdued
this
*NL*
morning
,
went
on
giving
his
instruction
.
She
followed
him
into
the
*NL*
dark
,
ugly
basement
,
and
lifted
her
arms
to
him
.
He
kissed
her
,
and
the
*NL*
intensity
of
passion
began
to
burn
him
again
.
Somebody
was
at
the
door
.
*NL*
He
ran
upstairs
;
she
returned
to
her
room
,
moving
as
if
in
a
trance
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
the
fire
slowly
went
down
.
He
felt
more
and
more
that
his
*NL*
experience
had
been
impersonal
,
and
not
Clara
.
He
loved
her
.
There
was
*NL*
a
big
tenderness
,
as
after
a
strong
emotion
they
had
known
together
;
but
*NL*
it
was
not
she
who
could
keep
his
soul
steady
.
He
had
wanted
her
to
be
*NL*
something
she
could
not
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
was
mad
with
desire
of
him
.
She
could
not
see
him
without
*NL*
touching
him
.
In
the
factory
,
as
he
talked
to
her
about
Spiral
hose
,
*NL*
she
ran
her
hand
secretly
along
his
side
.
She
followed
him
out
into
the
*NL*
basement
for
a
quick
kiss
;
her
eyes
,
always
mute
and
yearning
,
full
of
*NL*
unrestrained
passion
,
she
kept
fixed
on
his
.
He
was
afraid
of
her
,
lest
*NL*
she
should
too
flagrantly
give
herself
away
before
the
other
girls
.
She
*NL*
invariably
waited
for
him
at
dinnertime
for
him
to
embrace
her
before
*NL*
she
went
.
He
felt
as
if
she
were
helpless
,
almost
a
burden
to
him
,
and
*NL*
it
irritated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
you
always
want
to
be
kissing
and
embracing
for
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
Surely
there
's
a
time
for
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
at
him
,
and
the
hate
came
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
DO
I
always
want
to
be
kissing
you
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
,
even
if
I
come
to
ask
you
about
the
work
.
I
do
n't
want
anything
*NL*
to
do
with
love
when
I
'm
at
work
.
Work
's
work
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
love
?
''
she
asked
.
``
Has
it
to
have
special
hours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
out
of
work
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
'll
regulate
it
according
to
Mr.
Jordan
's
closing
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
according
to
the
freedom
from
business
of
any
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
only
to
exist
in
spare
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
,
and
not
always
then
--
not
the
kissing
sort
of
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
all
you
think
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
quite
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
was
cold
to
him
for
some
time
--
she
hated
him
;
and
while
she
was
*NL*
cold
and
contemptuous
,
he
was
uneasy
till
she
had
forgiven
him
again
.
*NL*
But
when
they
started
afresh
they
were
not
any
nearer
.
He
kept
her
*NL*
because
he
never
satisfied
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
spring
they
went
together
to
the
seaside
.
They
had
rooms
at
*NL*
a
little
cottage
near
Theddlethorpe
,
and
lived
as
man
and
wife
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Radford
sometimes
went
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
known
in
Nottingham
that
Paul
Morel
and
Mrs.
Dawes
were
going
*NL*
together
,
but
as
nothing
was
very
obvious
,
and
Clara
always
a
solitary
*NL*
person
,
and
he
seemed
so
simple
and
innocent
,
it
did
not
make
much
*NL*
difference
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
loved
the
Lincolnshire
coast
,
and
she
loved
the
sea
.
In
the
early
*NL*
morning
they
often
went
out
together
to
bathe
.
The
grey
of
the
dawn
,
*NL*
the
far
,
desolate
reaches
of
the
fenland
smitten
with
winter
,
the
*NL*
sea-meadows
rank
with
herbage
,
were
stark
enough
to
rejoice
his
soul
.
*NL*
As
they
stepped
on
to
the
highroad
from
their
plank
bridge
,
and
looked
*NL*
round
at
the
endless
monotony
of
levels
,
the
land
a
little
darker
than
*NL*
the
sky
,
the
sea
sounding
small
beyond
the
sandhills
,
his
heart
filled
*NL*
strong
with
the
sweeping
relentlessness
of
life
.
She
loved
him
then
.
He
*NL*
was
solitary
and
strong
,
and
his
eyes
had
a
beautiful
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
shuddered
with
cold
;
then
he
raced
her
down
the
road
to
the
green
*NL*
turf
bridge
.
She
could
run
well
.
Her
colour
soon
came
,
her
throat
was
*NL*
bare
,
her
eyes
shone
.
He
loved
her
for
being
so
luxuriously
heavy
,
and
*NL*
yet
so
quick
.
Himself
was
light
;
she
went
with
a
beautiful
rush
.
They
*NL*
grew
warm
,
and
walked
hand
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flush
came
into
the
sky
,
the
wan
moon
,
half-way
down
the
west
,
sank
*NL*
into
insignificance
.
On
the
shadowy
land
things
began
to
take
life
,
*NL*
plants
with
great
leaves
became
distinct
.
They
came
through
a
pass
in
*NL*
the
big
,
cold
sandhills
on
to
the
beach
.
The
long
waste
of
foreshore
lay
*NL*
moaning
under
the
dawn
and
the
sea
;
the
ocean
was
a
flat
dark
strip
with
*NL*
a
white
edge
.
Over
the
gloomy
sea
the
sky
grew
red
.
Quickly
the
fire
*NL*
spread
among
the
clouds
and
scattered
them
.
Crimson
burned
to
orange
,
*NL*
orange
to
dull
gold
,
and
in
a
golden
glitter
the
sun
came
up
,
dribbling
*NL*
fierily
over
the
waves
in
little
splashes
,
as
if
someone
had
gone
along
*NL*
and
the
light
had
spilled
from
her
pail
as
she
walked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
breakers
ran
down
the
shore
in
long
,
hoarse
strokes
.
Tiny
seagulls
,
*NL*
like
specks
of
spray
,
wheeled
above
the
line
of
surf
.
Their
crying
*NL*
seemed
larger
than
they
.
Far
away
the
coast
reached
out
,
and
melted
into
*NL*
the
morning
,
the
tussocky
sandhills
seemed
to
sink
to
a
level
with
the
*NL*
beach
.
Mablethorpe
was
tiny
on
their
right
.
They
had
alone
the
space
of
*NL*
all
this
level
shore
,
the
sea
,
and
the
upcoming
sun
,
the
faint
noise
of
*NL*
the
waters
,
the
sharp
crying
of
the
gulls
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
a
warm
hollow
in
the
sandhills
where
the
wind
did
not
come
.
He
*NL*
stood
looking
out
to
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
fine
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
do
n't
get
sentimental
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
irritated
her
to
see
him
standing
gazing
at
the
sea
,
like
a
solitary
*NL*
and
poetic
person
.
He
laughed
.
She
quickly
undressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
some
fine
waves
this
morning
,
''
she
said
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
better
swimmer
than
he
;
he
stood
idly
watching
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
coming
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
minute
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
white
and
velvet
skinned
,
with
heavy
shoulders
.
A
little
wind
,
*NL*
coming
from
the
sea
,
blew
across
her
body
and
ruffled
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
was
of
a
lovely
limpid
gold
colour
.
Veils
of
shadow
seemed
*NL*
to
be
drifting
away
on
the
north
and
the
south
.
Clara
stood
shrinking
*NL*
slightly
from
the
touch
of
the
wind
,
twisting
her
hair
.
The
sea-grass
*NL*
rose
behind
the
white
stripped
woman
.
She
glanced
at
the
sea
,
then
*NL*
looked
at
him
.
He
was
watching
her
with
dark
eyes
which
she
loved
and
*NL*
could
not
understand
.
She
hugged
her
breasts
between
her
arms
,
cringing
,
*NL*
laughing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oo
,
it
will
be
so
cold
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
,
held
her
suddenly
close
,
and
kissed
her
*NL*
again
.
She
stood
waiting
.
He
looked
into
her
eyes
,
then
away
at
the
pale
*NL*
sands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
then
!
''
he
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
drew
him
against
her
,
kissed
him
*NL*
passionately
,
and
went
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
come
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
plodding
heavily
over
the
sand
that
was
soft
as
velvet
.
He
,
*NL*
on
the
sandhills
,
watched
the
great
pale
coast
envelop
her
.
She
grew
*NL*
smaller
,
lost
proportion
,
seemed
only
like
a
large
white
bird
toiling
*NL*
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
more
than
a
big
white
pebble
on
the
beach
,
not
much
more
*NL*
than
a
clot
of
foam
being
blown
and
rolled
over
the
sand
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
move
very
slowly
across
the
vast
sounding
shore
.
As
he
*NL*
watched
,
he
lost
her
.
She
was
dazzled
out
of
sight
by
the
sunshine
.
*NL*
Again
he
saw
her
,
the
merest
white
speck
moving
against
the
white
,
*NL*
muttering
sea-edge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
how
little
she
is
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
She
's
lost
like
a
grain
*NL*
of
sand
in
the
beach
--
just
a
concentrated
speck
blown
along
,
a
tiny
*NL*
white
foam-bubble
,
almost
nothing
among
the
morning
.
Why
does
she
absorb
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
was
altogether
uninterrupted
:
she
was
gone
in
the
water
.
Far
*NL*
and
wide
the
beach
,
the
sandhills
with
their
blue
marrain
,
the
shining
*NL*
water
,
glowed
together
in
immense
,
unbroken
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
she
,
after
all
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Here
's
the
seacoast
*NL*
morning
,
big
and
permanent
and
beautiful
;
there
is
she
,
fretting
,
always
*NL*
unsatisfied
,
and
temporary
as
a
bubble
of
foam
.
What
does
she
mean
*NL*
to
me
,
after
all
?
She
represents
something
,
like
a
bubble
of
foam
*NL*
represents
the
sea
.
But
what
is
she
?
It
's
not
her
I
care
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
startled
by
his
own
unconscious
thoughts
,
that
seemed
to
speak
so
*NL*
distinctly
that
all
the
morning
could
hear
,
he
undressed
and
ran
quickly
*NL*
down
the
sands
.
She
was
watching
for
him
.
Her
arm
flashed
up
to
him
,
she
*NL*
heaved
on
a
wave
,
subsided
,
her
shoulders
in
a
pool
of
liquid
silver
.
*NL*
He
jumped
through
the
breakers
,
and
in
a
moment
her
hand
was
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
poor
swimmer
,
and
could
not
stay
long
in
the
water
.
She
played
*NL*
round
him
in
triumph
,
sporting
with
her
superiority
,
which
he
begrudged
*NL*
her
.
The
sunshine
stood
deep
and
fine
on
the
water
.
They
laughed
in
the
*NL*
sea
for
a
minute
or
two
,
then
raced
each
other
back
to
the
sandhills
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
drying
themselves
,
panting
heavily
,
he
watched
her
*NL*
laughing
,
breathless
face
,
her
bright
shoulders
,
her
breasts
that
swayed
*NL*
and
made
him
frightened
as
she
rubbed
them
,
and
he
thought
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
is
magnificent
,
and
even
bigger
than
the
morning
and
the
sea
.
*NL*
Is
she
--
?
Is
she
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
seeing
his
dark
eyes
fixed
on
her
,
broke
off
from
her
drying
with
a
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
looking
at
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
''
he
answered
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
met
his
,
and
in
a
moment
he
was
kissing
her
white
*NL*
``
goose-fleshed
''
shoulder
,
and
thinking
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
she
?
What
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
loved
him
in
the
morning
.
There
was
something
detached
,
hard
,
and
*NL*
elemental
about
his
kisses
then
,
as
if
he
were
only
conscious
of
his
own
*NL*
will
,
not
in
the
least
of
her
and
her
wanting
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
day
he
went
out
sketching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
''
he
said
to
her
,
``
go
with
your
mother
to
Sutton
.
I
am
so
dull
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
and
looked
at
him
.
He
knew
she
wanted
to
come
with
him
,
but
he
*NL*
preferred
to
be
alone
.
She
made
him
feel
imprisoned
when
she
was
there
,
*NL*
as
if
he
could
not
get
a
free
deep
breath
,
as
if
there
were
something
on
*NL*
top
of
him
.
She
felt
his
desire
to
be
free
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
he
came
back
to
her
.
They
walked
down
the
shore
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
then
sat
for
a
while
in
the
shelter
of
the
sandhills
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
,
''
she
said
,
as
they
stared
over
the
darkness
of
the
sea
,
where
*NL*
no
light
was
to
be
seen
--
``
it
seemed
as
if
you
only
loved
me
at
night
--
as
*NL*
if
you
did
n't
love
me
in
the
daytime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
the
cold
sand
through
his
fingers
,
feeling
guilty
under
the
*NL*
accusation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
night
is
free
to
you
,
''
he
replied
.
``
In
the
daytime
I
want
to
be
by
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
''
she
said
.
``
Why
,
even
now
,
when
we
are
on
this
short
holiday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Love-making
stifles
me
in
the
daytime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
need
n't
be
always
love-making
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
always
is
,
''
he
answered
,
``
when
you
and
I
are
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
feeling
very
bitter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
ever
want
to
marry
me
?
''
he
asked
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
me
?
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
I
should
like
us
to
have
children
,
''
he
answered
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
with
her
head
bent
,
fingering
the
sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
n't
really
want
a
divorce
from
Baxter
,
do
you
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
minutes
before
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
very
deliberately
;
``
I
do
n't
think
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
feel
as
if
you
belonged
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
do
n't
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
belongs
to
me
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
for
some
minutes
,
listening
to
the
wind
blowing
over
the
*NL*
hoarse
,
dark
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
never
really
intended
to
belong
to
ME
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
belong
to
you
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
;
``
because
you
do
n't
want
to
be
divorced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
knot
they
could
not
untie
,
so
they
left
it
,
took
what
they
*NL*
could
get
,
and
what
they
could
not
attain
they
ignored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consider
you
treated
Baxter
rottenly
,
''
he
said
another
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
half-expected
Clara
to
answer
him
,
as
his
mother
would
:
``
You
consider
*NL*
your
own
affairs
,
and
do
n't
know
so
much
about
other
people
's
.
''
But
she
*NL*
took
him
seriously
,
almost
to
his
own
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
thought
he
was
a
lily
of
the
valley
,
and
so
you
put
him
*NL*
in
an
appropriate
pot
,
and
tended
him
according
.
You
made
up
your
mind
*NL*
he
was
a
lily
of
the
valley
and
it
was
no
good
his
being
a
cow-parsnip
.
*NL*
You
would
n't
have
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
certainly
never
imagined
him
a
lily
of
the
valley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
imagined
him
something
he
was
n't
.
That
's
just
what
a
woman
is
.
She
*NL*
thinks
she
knows
what
's
good
for
a
man
,
and
she
's
going
to
see
he
gets
*NL*
it
;
and
no
matter
if
he
's
starving
,
he
may
sit
and
whistle
for
what
he
*NL*
needs
,
while
she
's
got
him
,
and
is
giving
him
what
's
good
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
you
doing
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
thinking
what
tune
I
shall
whistle
,
''
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
instead
of
boxing
his
ears
,
she
considered
him
in
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
I
want
to
give
you
what
's
good
for
you
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
;
but
love
should
give
a
sense
of
freedom
,
not
of
prison
.
*NL*
Miriam
made
me
feel
tied
up
like
a
donkey
to
a
stake
.
I
must
feed
on
her
*NL*
patch
,
and
nowhere
else
.
It
's
sickening
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
would
YOU
let
a
WOMAN
do
as
she
likes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
'll
see
that
she
likes
to
love
me
.
If
she
does
n't
--
well
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
hold
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
were
as
wonderful
as
you
say
--
,
''
replied
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
the
marvel
I
am
,
''
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
in
which
they
hated
each
other
,
though
they
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
's
a
dog
in
a
manger
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
which
of
us
is
the
dog
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
well
,
you
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
there
went
on
a
battle
between
them
.
She
knew
she
never
fully
had
*NL*
him
.
Some
part
,
big
and
vital
in
him
,
she
had
no
hold
over
;
nor
did
she
*NL*
ever
try
to
get
it
,
or
even
to
realise
what
it
was
.
And
he
knew
in
some
*NL*
way
that
she
held
herself
still
as
Mrs.
Dawes
.
She
did
not
love
Dawes
,
*NL*
never
had
loved
him
;
but
she
believed
he
loved
her
,
at
least
depended
on
*NL*
her
.
She
felt
a
certain
surety
about
him
that
she
never
felt
with
Paul
*NL*
Morel
.
Her
passion
for
the
young
man
had
filled
her
soul
,
given
her
*NL*
a
certain
satisfaction
,
eased
her
of
her
self-mistrust
,
her
doubt
.
*NL*
Whatever
else
she
was
,
she
was
inwardly
assured
.
It
was
almost
as
if
*NL*
she
had
gained
HERSELF
,
and
stood
now
distinct
and
complete
.
She
had
*NL*
received
her
confirmation
;
but
she
never
believed
that
her
life
belonged
*NL*
to
Paul
Morel
,
nor
his
to
her
.
They
would
separate
in
the
end
,
and
the
*NL*
rest
of
her
life
would
be
an
ache
after
him
.
But
at
any
rate
,
she
knew
*NL*
now
,
she
was
sure
of
herself
.
And
the
same
could
almost
be
said
of
him
.
*NL*
Together
they
had
received
the
baptism
of
life
,
each
through
the
other
;
*NL*
but
now
their
missions
were
separate
.
Where
he
wanted
to
go
she
could
*NL*
not
come
with
him
.
They
would
have
to
part
sooner
or
later
.
Even
if
they
*NL*
married
,
and
were
faithful
to
each
other
,
still
he
would
have
to
leave
*NL*
her
,
go
on
alone
,
and
she
would
only
have
to
attend
to
him
when
he
came
*NL*
home
.
But
it
was
not
possible
.
Each
wanted
a
mate
to
go
side
by
side
*NL*
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
had
gone
to
live
with
her
mother
upon
Mapperley
Plains
.
One
*NL*
evening
,
as
Paul
and
she
were
walking
along
Woodborough
Road
,
they
met
*NL*
Dawes
.
Morel
knew
something
about
the
bearing
of
the
man
approaching
,
*NL*
but
he
was
absorbed
in
his
thinking
at
the
moment
,
so
that
only
his
*NL*
artist
's
eye
watched
the
form
of
the
stranger
.
Then
he
suddenly
turned
*NL*
to
Clara
with
a
laugh
,
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
,
saying
,
*NL*
laughing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
walk
side
by
side
,
and
yet
I
'm
in
London
arguing
with
an
*NL*
imaginary
Orpen
;
and
where
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
instant
Dawes
passed
,
almost
touching
Morel
.
The
young
man
*NL*
glanced
,
saw
the
dark
brown
eyes
burning
,
full
of
hate
and
yet
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
that
?
''
he
asked
of
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Baxter
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
took
his
hand
from
her
shoulder
and
glanced
round
;
then
he
saw
*NL*
again
distinctly
the
man
's
form
as
it
approached
him
.
Dawes
still
walked
*NL*
erect
,
with
his
fine
shoulders
flung
back
,
and
his
face
lifted
;
but
*NL*
there
was
a
furtive
look
in
his
eyes
that
gave
one
the
impression
he
was
*NL*
trying
to
get
unnoticed
past
every
person
he
met
,
glancing
suspiciously
*NL*
to
see
what
they
thought
of
him
.
And
his
hands
seemed
to
be
wanting
to
*NL*
hide
.
He
wore
old
clothes
,
the
trousers
were
torn
at
the
knee
,
and
the
*NL*
handkerchief
tied
round
his
throat
was
dirty
;
but
his
cap
was
still
*NL*
defiantly
over
one
eye
.
As
she
saw
him
,
Clara
felt
guilty
.
There
was
*NL*
a
tiredness
and
despair
on
his
face
that
made
her
hate
him
,
because
it
*NL*
hurt
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
looks
shady
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
note
of
pity
in
his
voice
reproached
her
,
and
made
her
feel
*NL*
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
true
commonness
comes
out
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hate
him
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
talk
,
''
she
said
,
``
about
the
cruelty
of
women
;
I
wish
you
knew
the
*NL*
cruelty
of
men
in
their
brute
force
.
They
simply
do
n't
know
that
the
*NL*
woman
exists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
I
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
I
know
you
exist
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
ME
you
know
nothing
,
''
she
said
bitterly
--
``
about
ME
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
than
Baxter
knew
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
as
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
puzzled
,
and
helpless
,
and
angry
.
There
she
walked
unknown
to
*NL*
him
,
though
they
had
been
through
such
experience
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
know
ME
pretty
well
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
know
Baxter
as
well
as
you
know
me
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
let
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
let
you
know
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
what
men
WO
N'T
let
you
do
.
They
wo
n't
let
you
get
really
near
to
*NL*
them
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
n't
I
let
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
slowly
;
``
but
you
've
never
come
near
to
me
.
You
ca
n't
*NL*
come
out
of
yourself
,
you
ca
n't
.
Baxter
could
do
that
better
than
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
pondering
.
He
was
angry
with
her
for
preferring
Baxter
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
begin
to
value
Baxter
now
you
've
not
got
him
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
can
only
see
where
he
was
different
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
felt
she
had
a
grudge
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
as
they
were
coming
home
over
the
fields
,
she
startled
him
*NL*
by
asking
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
it
's
worth
it
--
the
--
the
sex
part
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
act
of
loving
,
itself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
is
it
worth
anything
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
you
separate
it
?
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
the
culmination
of
*NL*
everything
.
All
our
intimacy
culminates
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
silent
.
A
flash
of
hate
for
her
came
up
.
After
all
,
she
was
*NL*
dissatisfied
with
him
,
even
there
,
where
he
thought
they
fulfilled
each
*NL*
other
.
But
he
believed
her
too
implicitly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
,
''
she
continued
slowly
,
``
as
if
I
had
n't
got
you
,
as
if
all
of
*NL*
you
were
n't
there
,
and
as
if
it
were
n't
ME
you
were
taking
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
just
for
yourself
.
It
has
been
fine
,
so
that
I
dare
n't
think
*NL*
of
it
.
But
is
it
ME
you
want
,
or
is
it
IT
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
again
felt
guilty
.
Did
he
leave
Clara
out
of
count
,
and
take
simply
*NL*
women
?
But
he
thought
that
was
splitting
a
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
had
Baxter
,
actually
had
him
,
then
I
DID
feel
as
if
I
had
all
of
*NL*
him
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
was
better
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
it
was
more
whole
.
I
do
n't
say
you
have
n't
given
me
more
than
*NL*
he
ever
gave
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
could
give
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perhaps
;
but
you
've
never
given
me
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
knitted
his
brows
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
start
to
make
love
to
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
just
go
like
a
leaf
down
*NL*
the
wind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
leave
me
out
of
count
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
is
it
nothing
to
you
?
''
he
asked
,
almost
rigid
with
chagrin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
something
;
and
sometimes
you
have
carried
me
away
--
right
away
--
I
*NL*
know
--
and
--
I
reverence
you
for
it
--
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
`
but
'
me
,
''
he
said
,
kissing
her
quickly
,
as
a
fire
ran
through
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
submitted
,
and
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
as
he
said
.
As
a
rule
,
when
he
started
love-making
,
the
*NL*
emotion
was
strong
enough
to
carry
with
it
everything
--
reason
,
soul
,
*NL*
blood
--
in
a
great
sweep
,
like
the
Trent
carries
bodily
its
back-swirls
*NL*
and
intertwinings
,
noiselessly
.
Gradually
the
little
criticisms
,
the
*NL*
little
sensations
,
were
lost
,
thought
also
went
,
everything
borne
along
*NL*
in
one
flood
.
He
became
,
not
a
man
with
a
mind
,
but
a
great
instinct
.
*NL*
His
hands
were
like
creatures
,
living
;
his
limbs
,
his
body
,
were
*NL*
all
life
and
consciousness
,
subject
to
no
will
of
his
,
but
living
in
*NL*
themselves
.
Just
as
he
was
,
so
it
seemed
the
vigorous
,
wintry
stars
were
*NL*
strong
also
with
life
.
He
and
they
struck
with
the
same
pulse
of
fire
,
*NL*
and
the
same
joy
of
strength
which
held
the
bracken-frond
stiff
near
*NL*
his
eyes
held
his
own
body
firm
.
It
was
as
if
he
,
and
the
stars
,
and
the
*NL*
dark
herbage
,
and
Clara
were
licked
up
in
an
immense
tongue
of
flame
,
*NL*
which
tore
onwards
and
upwards
.
Everything
rushed
along
in
living
beside
*NL*
him
;
everything
was
still
,
perfect
in
itself
,
along
with
him
.
This
*NL*
wonderful
stillness
in
each
thing
in
itself
,
while
it
was
being
borne
*NL*
along
in
a
very
ecstasy
of
living
,
seemed
the
highest
point
of
bliss
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Clara
knew
this
held
him
to
her
,
so
she
trusted
altogether
to
the
*NL*
passion
.
It
,
however
,
failed
her
very
often
.
They
did
not
often
reach
*NL*
again
the
height
of
that
once
when
the
peewits
had
called
.
Gradually
,
*NL*
some
mechanical
effort
spoilt
their
loving
,
or
,
when
they
had
splendid
*NL*
moments
,
they
had
them
separately
,
and
not
so
satisfactorily
.
So
often
*NL*
he
seemed
merely
to
be
running
on
alone
;
often
they
realised
it
had
been
*NL*
a
failure
,
not
what
they
had
wanted
.
He
left
her
,
knowing
THAT
evening
*NL*
had
only
made
a
little
split
between
them
.
Their
loving
grew
more
*NL*
mechanical
,
without
the
marvellous
glamour
.
Gradually
they
began
to
*NL*
introduce
novelties
,
to
get
back
some
of
the
feeling
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
They
would
be
very
near
,
almost
dangerously
near
to
the
river
,
so
that
*NL*
the
black
water
ran
not
far
from
his
face
,
and
it
gave
a
little
thrill
;
*NL*
or
they
loved
sometimes
in
a
little
hollow
below
the
fence
of
the
path
*NL*
where
people
were
passing
occasionally
,
on
the
edge
of
the
town
,
and
*NL*
they
heard
footsteps
coming
,
almost
felt
the
vibration
of
the
tread
,
*NL*
and
they
heard
what
the
passersby
said
--
strange
little
things
that
*NL*
were
never
intended
to
be
heard
.
And
afterwards
each
of
them
was
rather
*NL*
ashamed
,
and
these
things
caused
a
distance
between
the
two
of
them
.
He
*NL*
began
to
despise
her
a
little
,
as
if
she
had
merited
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
he
left
her
to
go
to
Daybrook
Station
over
the
fields
.
It
*NL*
was
very
dark
,
with
an
attempt
at
snow
,
although
the
spring
was
so
far
*NL*
advanced
.
Morel
had
not
much
time
;
he
plunged
forward
.
The
town
ceases
*NL*
almost
abruptly
on
the
edge
of
a
steep
hollow
;
there
the
houses
with
*NL*
their
yellow
lights
stand
up
against
the
darkness
.
He
went
over
the
*NL*
stile
,
and
dropped
quickly
into
the
hollow
of
the
fields
.
Under
the
*NL*
orchard
one
warm
window
shone
in
Swineshead
Farm
.
Paul
glanced
round
.
*NL*
Behind
,
the
houses
stood
on
the
brim
of
the
dip
,
black
against
the
*NL*
sky
,
like
wild
beasts
glaring
curiously
with
yellow
eyes
down
into
the
*NL*
darkness
.
It
was
the
town
that
seemed
savage
and
uncouth
,
glaring
on
the
*NL*
clouds
at
the
back
of
him
.
Some
creature
stirred
under
the
willows
of
*NL*
the
farm
pond
.
It
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
close
up
to
the
next
stile
before
he
saw
a
dark
shape
leaning
*NL*
against
it
.
The
man
moved
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-evening
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-evening
!
''
Morel
answered
,
not
noticing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
Morel
?
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
knew
it
was
Dawes
.
The
man
stopped
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
yer
,
have
I
?
''
he
said
awkwardly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
miss
my
train
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
see
nothing
of
Dawes
's
face
.
The
man
's
teeth
seemed
to
chatter
*NL*
as
he
talked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
going
to
get
it
from
me
now
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
attempted
to
move
forward
;
the
other
man
stepped
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
yer
goin
'
to
take
that
top-coat
off
,
''
he
said
,
``
or
are
you
goin
'
to
*NL*
lie
down
to
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
afraid
the
man
was
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
do
n't
know
how
to
fight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
then
,
''
answered
Dawes
,
and
before
the
younger
man
knew
where
*NL*
he
was
,
he
was
staggering
backwards
from
a
blow
across
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
night
went
black
.
He
tore
off
his
overcoat
and
coat
,
dodging
*NL*
a
blow
,
and
flung
the
garments
over
Dawes
.
The
latter
swore
savagely
.
*NL*
Morel
,
in
his
shirt-sleeves
,
was
now
alert
and
furious
.
He
felt
his
*NL*
whole
body
unsheath
itself
like
a
claw
.
He
could
not
fight
,
so
he
would
*NL*
use
his
wits
.
The
other
man
became
more
distinct
to
him
;
he
could
see
*NL*
particularly
the
shirt-breast
.
Dawes
stumbled
over
Paul
's
coats
,
then
*NL*
came
rushing
forward
.
The
young
man
's
mouth
was
bleeding
.
It
was
the
*NL*
other
man
's
mouth
he
was
dying
to
get
at
,
and
the
desire
was
anguish
*NL*
in
its
strength
.
He
stepped
quickly
through
the
stile
,
and
as
Dawes
was
*NL*
coming
through
after
him
,
like
a
flash
he
got
a
blow
in
over
the
other
's
*NL*
mouth
.
He
shivered
with
pleasure
.
Dawes
advanced
slowly
,
spitting
.
Paul
*NL*
was
afraid
;
he
moved
round
to
get
to
the
stile
again
.
Suddenly
,
from
*NL*
out
of
nowhere
,
came
a
great
blow
against
his
ear
,
that
sent
him
falling
*NL*
helpless
backwards
.
He
heard
Dawes
's
heavy
panting
,
like
a
wild
beast
's
,
*NL*
then
came
a
kick
on
the
knee
,
giving
him
such
agony
that
he
got
up
and
,
*NL*
quite
blind
,
leapt
clean
under
his
enemy
's
guard
.
He
felt
blows
and
*NL*
kicks
,
but
they
did
not
hurt
.
He
hung
on
to
the
bigger
man
like
a
wild
*NL*
cat
,
till
at
last
Dawes
fell
with
a
crash
,
losing
his
presence
of
mind
.
*NL*
Paul
went
down
with
him
.
Pure
instinct
brought
his
hands
to
the
man
's
*NL*
neck
,
and
before
Dawes
,
in
frenzy
and
agony
,
could
wrench
him
free
,
*NL*
he
had
got
his
fists
twisted
in
the
scarf
and
his
knuckles
dug
in
the
*NL*
throat
of
the
other
man
.
He
was
a
pure
instinct
,
without
reason
or
*NL*
feeling
.
His
body
,
hard
and
wonderful
in
itself
,
cleaved
against
the
*NL*
struggling
body
of
the
other
man
;
not
a
muscle
in
him
relaxed
.
He
was
*NL*
quite
unconscious
,
only
his
body
had
taken
upon
itself
to
kill
this
*NL*
other
man
.
For
himself
,
he
had
neither
feeling
nor
reason
.
He
lay
*NL*
pressed
hard
against
his
adversary
,
his
body
adjusting
itself
to
its
one
*NL*
pure
purpose
of
choking
the
other
man
,
resisting
exactly
at
the
right
*NL*
moment
,
with
exactly
the
right
amount
of
strength
,
the
struggles
of
*NL*
the
other
,
silent
,
intent
,
unchanging
,
gradually
pressing
its
knuckles
*NL*
deeper
,
feeling
the
struggles
of
the
other
body
become
wilder
and
*NL*
more
frenzied
.
Tighter
and
tighter
grew
his
body
,
like
a
screw
that
is
*NL*
gradually
increasing
in
pressure
,
till
something
breaks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
suddenly
he
relaxed
,
full
of
wonder
and
misgiving
.
Dawes
had
been
*NL*
yielding
.
Morel
felt
his
body
flame
with
pain
,
as
he
realised
what
he
*NL*
was
doing
;
he
was
all
bewildered
.
Dawes
's
struggles
suddenly
renewed
*NL*
themselves
in
a
furious
spasm
.
Paul
's
hands
were
wrenched
,
torn
out
of
*NL*
the
scarf
in
which
they
were
knotted
,
and
he
was
flung
away
,
helpless
.
*NL*
He
heard
the
horrid
sound
of
the
other
's
gasping
,
but
he
lay
stunned
;
*NL*
then
,
still
dazed
,
he
felt
the
blows
of
the
other
's
feet
,
and
lost
*NL*
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
,
grunting
with
pain
like
a
beast
,
was
kicking
the
prostrate
body
*NL*
of
his
rival
.
Suddenly
the
whistle
of
the
train
shrieked
two
fields
*NL*
away
.
He
turned
round
and
glared
suspiciously
.
What
was
coming
?
He
saw
*NL*
the
lights
of
the
train
draw
across
his
vision
.
It
seemed
to
him
people
*NL*
were
approaching
.
He
made
off
across
the
field
into
Nottingham
,
and
*NL*
dimly
in
his
consciousness
as
he
went
,
he
felt
on
his
foot
the
place
*NL*
where
his
boot
had
knocked
against
one
of
the
lad
's
bones
.
The
knock
*NL*
seemed
to
re-echo
inside
him
;
he
hurried
to
get
away
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
gradually
came
to
himself
.
He
knew
where
he
was
and
what
had
*NL*
happened
,
but
he
did
not
want
to
move
.
He
lay
still
,
with
tiny
bits
of
*NL*
snow
tickling
his
face
.
It
was
pleasant
to
lie
quite
,
quite
still
.
The
*NL*
time
passed
.
It
was
the
bits
of
snow
that
kept
rousing
him
when
he
did
*NL*
not
want
to
be
roused
.
At
last
his
will
clicked
into
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
n't
lie
here
,
''
he
said
;
``
it
's
silly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
still
he
did
not
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
I
was
going
to
get
up
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
Why
do
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
still
it
was
some
time
before
he
had
sufficiently
pulled
himself
*NL*
together
to
stir
;
then
gradually
he
got
up
.
Pain
made
him
sick
and
*NL*
dazed
,
but
his
brain
was
clear
.
Reeling
,
he
groped
for
his
coats
and
got
*NL*
them
on
,
buttoning
his
overcoat
up
to
his
ears
.
It
was
some
time
before
*NL*
he
found
his
cap
.
He
did
not
know
whether
his
face
was
still
bleeding
.
*NL*
Walking
blindly
,
every
step
making
him
sick
with
pain
,
he
went
back
to
*NL*
the
pond
and
washed
his
face
and
hands
.
The
icy
water
hurt
,
but
helped
*NL*
to
bring
him
back
to
himself
.
He
crawled
back
up
the
hill
to
the
tram
.
*NL*
He
wanted
to
get
to
his
mother
--
he
must
get
to
his
mother
--
that
was
his
*NL*
blind
intention
.
He
covered
his
face
as
much
as
he
could
,
and
struggled
*NL*
sickly
along
.
Continually
the
ground
seemed
to
fall
away
from
him
as
*NL*
he
walked
,
and
he
felt
himself
dropping
with
a
sickening
feeling
into
*NL*
space
;
so
,
like
a
nightmare
,
he
got
through
with
the
journey
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
was
in
bed
.
He
looked
at
himself
.
His
face
was
discoloured
*NL*
and
smeared
with
blood
,
almost
like
a
dead
man
's
face
.
He
washed
it
,
and
*NL*
went
to
bed
.
The
night
went
by
in
delirium
.
In
the
morning
he
found
his
*NL*
mother
looking
at
him
.
Her
blue
eyes
--
they
were
all
he
wanted
to
see
.
*NL*
She
was
there
;
he
was
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
much
,
mother
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
was
Baxter
Dawes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
where
it
hurts
you
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
my
shoulder
.
Say
it
was
a
bicycle
accident
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
move
his
arm
.
Presently
Minnie
,
the
little
servant
,
came
*NL*
upstairs
with
some
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
's
nearly
frightened
me
out
of
my
wits
--
fainted
away
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
he
could
not
bear
it
.
His
mother
nursed
him
;
he
told
her
about
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
I
should
have
done
with
them
all
,
''
she
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
covered
him
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
think
about
it
,
''
she
said
--
``
only
try
to
go
to
sleep
.
The
*NL*
doctor
wo
n't
be
here
till
eleven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
dislocated
shoulder
,
and
the
second
day
acute
bronchitis
set
*NL*
in
.
His
mother
was
pale
as
death
now
,
and
very
thin
.
She
would
sit
and
*NL*
look
at
him
,
then
away
into
space
.
There
was
something
between
them
that
*NL*
neither
dared
mention
.
Clara
came
to
see
him
.
Afterwards
he
said
to
his
*NL*
mother
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
makes
me
tired
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
wish
she
would
n't
come
,
''
Mrs.
Morel
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
day
Miriam
came
,
but
she
seemed
almost
like
a
stranger
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
I
do
n't
care
about
them
,
mother
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
you
do
n't
,
my
son
,
''
she
replied
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
given
out
everywhere
that
it
was
a
bicycle
accident
.
Soon
he
*NL*
was
able
to
go
to
work
again
,
but
now
there
was
a
constant
sickness
and
*NL*
gnawing
at
his
heart
.
He
went
to
Clara
,
but
there
seemed
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
nobody
there
.
He
could
not
work
.
He
and
his
mother
seemed
almost
to
*NL*
avoid
each
other
.
There
was
some
secret
between
them
which
they
could
*NL*
not
bear
.
He
was
not
aware
of
it
.
He
only
knew
that
his
life
seemed
*NL*
unbalanced
,
as
if
it
were
going
to
smash
into
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
.
She
realised
that
he
*NL*
seemed
unaware
of
her
.
Even
when
he
came
to
her
he
seemed
unaware
of
*NL*
her
;
always
he
was
somewhere
else
.
She
felt
she
was
clutching
for
him
,
*NL*
and
he
was
somewhere
else
.
It
tortured
her
,
and
so
she
tortured
him
.
For
*NL*
a
month
at
a
time
she
kept
him
at
arm
's
length
.
He
almost
hated
her
,
and
*NL*
was
driven
to
her
in
spite
of
himself
.
He
went
mostly
into
the
company
*NL*
of
men
,
was
always
at
the
George
or
the
White
Horse
.
His
mother
was
ill
,
*NL*
distant
,
quiet
,
shadowy
.
He
was
terrified
of
something
;
he
dared
not
*NL*
look
at
her
.
Her
eyes
seemed
to
grow
darker
,
her
face
more
waxen
;
still
*NL*
she
dragged
about
at
her
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Whitsuntide
he
said
he
would
go
to
Blackpool
for
four
days
with
his
*NL*
friend
Newton
.
The
latter
was
a
big
,
jolly
fellow
,
with
a
touch
of
the
*NL*
bounder
about
him
.
Paul
said
his
mother
must
go
to
Sheffield
to
stay
a
*NL*
week
with
Annie
,
who
lived
there
.
Perhaps
the
change
would
do
her
good
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
was
attending
a
woman
's
doctor
in
Nottingham
.
He
said
her
*NL*
heart
and
her
digestion
were
wrong
.
She
consented
to
go
to
Sheffield
,
*NL*
though
she
did
not
want
to
;
but
now
she
would
do
everything
her
son
*NL*
wished
of
her
.
Paul
said
he
would
come
for
her
on
the
fifth
day
,
and
*NL*
stay
also
in
Sheffield
till
the
holiday
was
up
.
It
was
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
young
men
set
off
gaily
for
Blackpool
.
Mrs.
Morel
was
quite
*NL*
lively
as
Paul
kissed
her
and
left
her
.
Once
at
the
station
,
he
forgot
*NL*
everything
.
Four
days
were
clear
--
not
an
anxiety
,
not
a
thought
.
The
two
*NL*
young
men
simply
enjoyed
themselves
.
Paul
was
like
another
man
.
None
of
*NL*
himself
remained
--
no
Clara
,
no
Miriam
,
no
mother
that
fretted
him
.
He
*NL*
wrote
to
them
all
,
and
long
letters
to
his
mother
;
but
they
were
jolly
*NL*
letters
that
made
her
laugh
.
He
was
having
a
good
time
,
as
young
fellows
*NL*
will
in
a
place
like
Blackpool
.
And
underneath
it
all
was
a
shadow
for
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
was
very
gay
,
excited
at
the
thought
of
staying
with
his
mother
in
*NL*
Sheffield
.
Newton
was
to
spend
the
day
with
them
.
Their
train
was
late
.
*NL*
Joking
,
laughing
,
with
their
pipes
between
their
teeth
,
the
young
men
*NL*
swung
their
bags
on
to
the
tram-car
.
Paul
had
bought
his
mother
a
little
*NL*
collar
of
real
lace
that
he
wanted
to
see
her
wear
,
so
that
he
could
*NL*
tease
her
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
lived
in
a
nice
house
,
and
had
a
little
maid
.
Paul
ran
gaily
up
*NL*
the
steps
.
He
expected
his
mother
laughing
in
the
hall
,
but
it
was
*NL*
Annie
who
opened
to
him
.
She
seemed
distant
to
him
.
He
stood
a
second
in
*NL*
dismay
.
Annie
let
him
kiss
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
my
mother
ill
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
she
's
not
very
well
.
Do
n't
upset
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
in
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
queer
feeling
went
over
him
,
as
if
all
the
sunshine
had
*NL*
gone
out
of
him
,
and
it
was
all
shadow
.
He
dropped
the
bag
and
ran
*NL*
upstairs
.
Hesitating
,
he
opened
the
door
.
His
mother
sat
up
in
bed
,
*NL*
wearing
a
dressing-gown
of
old-rose
colour
.
She
looked
at
him
almost
as
*NL*
if
she
were
ashamed
of
herself
,
pleading
to
him
,
humble
.
He
saw
the
ashy
*NL*
look
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
never
coming
,
''
she
answered
gaily
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
only
fell
on
his
knees
at
the
bedside
,
and
buried
his
face
in
the
*NL*
bedclothes
,
crying
in
agony
,
and
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
--
mother
--
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stroked
his
hair
slowly
with
her
thin
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
cry
,
''
she
said
.
``
Do
n't
cry
--
it
's
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
felt
as
if
his
blood
was
melting
into
tears
,
and
he
cried
in
*NL*
terror
and
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
--
do
n't
cry
,
''
his
mother
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slowly
she
stroked
his
hair
.
Shocked
out
of
himself
,
he
cried
,
and
the
*NL*
tears
hurt
in
every
fibre
of
his
body
.
Suddenly
he
stopped
,
but
he
dared
*NL*
not
lift
his
face
out
of
the
bedclothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ARE
late
.
Where
have
you
been
?
''
his
mother
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
train
was
late
,
''
he
replied
,
muffled
in
the
sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
miserable
Central
!
Is
Newton
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
must
be
hungry
,
and
they
've
kept
dinner
waiting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
wrench
he
looked
up
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
mother
?
''
he
asked
brutally
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
averted
her
eyes
as
she
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
bit
of
a
tumour
,
my
boy
.
You
need
n't
trouble
.
It
's
been
*NL*
there
--
the
lump
has
--
a
long
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Up
came
the
tears
again
.
His
mind
was
clear
and
hard
,
but
his
body
was
*NL*
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
her
hand
on
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
.
But
you
know
they
can
sweal
a
tumour
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
feeling
dazed
and
helpless
,
like
a
child
.
He
thought
perhaps
it
*NL*
was
as
she
said
.
Yes
;
he
reassured
himself
it
was
so
.
But
all
the
while
*NL*
his
blood
and
his
body
knew
definitely
what
it
was
.
He
sat
down
on
*NL*
the
bed
,
and
took
her
hand
.
She
had
never
had
but
the
one
ring
--
her
*NL*
wedding-ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
were
you
poorly
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
yesterday
it
began
,
''
she
answered
submissively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pains
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
not
more
than
I
've
often
had
at
home
.
I
believe
Dr.
Ansell
is
*NL*
an
alarmist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
not
to
have
travelled
alone
,
''
he
said
,
to
himself
more
than
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it
!
''
she
answered
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
go
and
have
your
dinner
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
MUST
be
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
had
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
a
beautiful
sole
I
had
.
Annie
IS
good
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
a
little
while
,
then
he
went
downstairs
.
He
was
very
white
*NL*
and
strained
.
Newton
sat
in
miserable
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
he
went
into
the
scullery
to
help
Annie
to
wash
up
.
The
*NL*
little
maid
had
gone
on
an
errand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
really
a
tumour
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
began
to
cry
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pain
she
had
yesterday
--
I
never
saw
anybody
suffer
like
it
!
''
she
*NL*
cried
.
``
Leonard
ran
like
a
madman
for
Dr.
Ansell
,
and
when
she
'd
got
to
*NL*
bed
she
said
to
me
:
`
Annie
,
look
at
this
lump
on
my
side
.
I
wonder
what
*NL*
it
is
?
'
And
there
I
looked
,
and
I
thought
I
should
have
dropped
.
Paul
,
*NL*
as
true
as
I
'm
here
,
it
's
a
lump
as
big
as
my
double
fist
.
I
said
:
`
Good
*NL*
gracious
,
mother
,
whenever
did
that
come
?
'
`
Why
,
child
,
'
she
said
,
`
it
's
*NL*
been
there
a
long
time
.
'
I
thought
I
should
have
died
,
our
Paul
,
I
did
.
*NL*
She
's
been
having
these
pains
for
months
at
home
,
and
nobody
looking
*NL*
after
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
came
to
his
eyes
,
then
dried
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
's
been
attending
the
doctor
in
Nottingham
--
and
she
never
told
*NL*
me
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
'd
have
been
at
home
,
''
said
Annie
,
``
I
should
have
seen
for
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
like
a
man
walking
in
unrealities
.
In
the
afternoon
he
went
to
*NL*
see
the
doctor
.
The
latter
was
a
shrewd
,
lovable
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
it
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
looked
at
the
young
man
,
then
knitted
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
a
large
tumour
which
has
formed
in
the
membrane
,
''
he
said
*NL*
slowly
,
``
and
which
we
MAY
be
able
to
make
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
operate
?
''
asked
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
there
,
''
replied
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
QUITE
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
meditated
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
it
's
a
tumour
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Why
did
Dr.
Jameson
in
*NL*
Nottingham
never
find
out
anything
about
it
?
She
's
been
going
to
him
for
*NL*
weeks
,
and
he
's
treated
her
for
heart
and
indigestion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Morel
never
told
Dr.
Jameson
about
the
lump
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
you
KNOW
it
's
a
tumour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
am
not
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
MIGHT
it
be
?
You
asked
my
sister
if
there
was
cancer
in
the
*NL*
family
.
Might
it
be
cancer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
shall
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
an
examination
,
with
Dr.
Jameson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
have
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
arrange
about
that
.
His
fee
would
n't
be
less
than
ten
guineas
*NL*
to
come
here
from
Nottingham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
would
you
like
him
to
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
call
in
this
evening
,
and
we
will
talk
it
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
away
,
biting
his
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
could
come
downstairs
for
tea
,
the
doctor
said
.
Her
son
went
*NL*
upstairs
to
help
her
.
She
wore
the
old-rose
dressing-gown
that
Leonard
*NL*
had
given
Annie
,
and
,
with
a
little
colour
in
her
face
,
was
quite
young
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
look
quite
pretty
in
that
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
they
make
me
so
fine
,
I
hardly
know
myself
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
stood
up
to
walk
,
the
colour
went
.
Paul
helped
her
,
*NL*
half-carrying
her
.
At
the
top
of
the
stairs
she
was
gone
.
He
lifted
her
*NL*
up
and
carried
her
quickly
downstairs
;
laid
her
on
the
couch
.
She
was
*NL*
light
and
frail
.
Her
face
looked
as
if
she
were
dead
,
with
blue
lips
*NL*
shut
tight
.
Her
eyes
opened
--
her
blue
,
unfailing
eyes
--
and
she
looked
at
*NL*
him
pleadingly
,
almost
wanting
him
to
forgive
her
.
He
held
brandy
to
*NL*
her
lips
,
but
her
mouth
would
not
open
.
All
the
time
she
watched
him
*NL*
lovingly
.
She
was
only
sorry
for
him
.
The
tears
ran
down
his
face
*NL*
without
ceasing
,
but
not
a
muscle
moved
.
He
was
intent
on
getting
*NL*
a
little
brandy
between
her
lips
.
Soon
she
was
able
to
swallow
a
*NL*
teaspoonful
.
She
lay
back
,
so
tired
.
The
tears
continued
to
run
down
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
she
panted
,
``
it
'll
go
off
.
Do
n't
cry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
doing
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
she
was
better
again
.
He
was
kneeling
beside
the
couch
.
*NL*
They
looked
into
each
other
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
make
a
trouble
of
it
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
mother
.
You
'll
have
to
be
quite
still
,
and
then
you
'll
get
better
*NL*
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
white
to
the
lips
,
and
their
eyes
as
they
looked
at
each
*NL*
other
understood
.
Her
eyes
were
so
blue
--
such
a
wonderful
forget-me-not
*NL*
blue
!
He
felt
if
only
they
had
been
of
a
different
colour
he
could
have
*NL*
borne
it
better
.
His
heart
seemed
to
be
ripping
slowly
in
his
breast
.
He
*NL*
kneeled
there
,
holding
her
hand
,
and
neither
said
anything
.
Then
Annie
*NL*
came
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
all
right
?
''
she
murmured
timidly
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
sat
down
and
told
her
about
Blackpool
.
She
was
curious
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
or
two
after
,
he
went
to
see
Dr.
Jameson
in
Nottingham
,
to
arrange
*NL*
for
a
consultation
.
Paul
had
practically
no
money
in
the
world
.
But
he
*NL*
could
borrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
had
been
used
to
go
to
the
public
consultation
on
Saturday
*NL*
morning
,
when
she
could
see
the
doctor
for
only
a
nominal
sum
.
Her
son
*NL*
went
on
the
same
day
.
The
waiting-room
was
full
of
poor
women
,
who
sat
*NL*
patiently
on
a
bench
around
the
wall
.
Paul
thought
of
his
mother
,
in
her
*NL*
little
black
costume
,
sitting
waiting
likewise
.
The
doctor
was
late
.
The
*NL*
women
all
looked
rather
frightened
.
Paul
asked
the
nurse
in
attendance
*NL*
if
he
could
see
the
doctor
immediately
he
came
.
It
was
arranged
so
.
The
*NL*
women
sitting
patiently
round
the
walls
of
the
room
eyed
the
young
man
*NL*
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
doctor
came
.
He
was
about
forty
,
good-looking
,
*NL*
brown-skinned
.
His
wife
had
died
,
and
he
,
who
had
loved
her
,
had
*NL*
specialised
on
women
's
ailments
.
Paul
told
his
name
and
his
mother
's
.
*NL*
The
doctor
did
not
remember
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Number
forty-six
M.
,
''
said
the
nurse
;
and
the
doctor
looked
up
the
case
*NL*
in
his
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
big
lump
that
may
be
a
tumour
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
But
Dr.
Ansell
*NL*
was
going
to
write
you
a
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
''
replied
the
doctor
,
drawing
the
letter
from
his
pocket
.
He
*NL*
was
very
friendly
,
affable
,
busy
,
kind
.
He
would
come
to
Sheffield
the
*NL*
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
father
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
coal-miner
,
''
replied
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
well
off
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
--
I
see
after
this
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
smiled
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
clerk
in
Jordan
's
Appliance
Factory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
smiled
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Er
--
to
go
to
Sheffield
!
''
he
said
,
putting
the
tips
of
his
fingers
*NL*
together
,
and
smiling
with
his
eyes
.
``
Eight
guineas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
''
said
Paul
,
flushing
and
rising
.
``
And
you
'll
come
*NL*
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
--
Sunday
?
Yes
!
Can
you
tell
me
about
what
time
there
is
a
*NL*
train
in
the
afternoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
Central
gets
in
at
four-fifteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
there
be
any
way
of
getting
up
to
the
house
?
Shall
I
have
to
*NL*
walk
?
''
The
doctor
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
the
tram
,
''
said
Paul
;
``
the
Western
Park
tram
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
made
a
note
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
''
he
said
,
and
shook
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Paul
went
on
home
to
see
his
father
,
who
was
left
in
the
charge
of
*NL*
Minnie
.
Walter
Morel
was
getting
very
grey
now
.
Paul
found
him
digging
*NL*
in
the
garden
.
He
had
written
him
a
letter
.
He
shook
hands
with
his
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
son
!
Tha
has
landed
,
then
?
''
said
the
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
son
.
``
But
I
'm
going
back
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are

''
exclaimed
the
collier
.
``
An

eaten

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
like
thee
,
''
said
Morel
.
``
Come
thy
ways
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
was
afraid
of
the
mention
of
his
wife
.
The
two
went
indoors
.
*NL*
Paul
ate
in
silence
;
his
father
,
with
earthy
hands
,
and
sleeves
rolled
*NL*
up
,
sat
in
the
arm-chair
opposite
and
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
an
'
how
is
she
?
''
asked
the
miner
at
length
,
in
a
little
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
can
sit
up
;
she
can
be
carried
down
for
tea
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
blessin

''
exclaimed
Morel
.
``
I
hope

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

*NL*
``

That

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
guineas

''
the
miner
spoke
breathlessly
.
``
Well
,
we
mun
find
it
*NL*
from
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
pay
that

''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
between
them
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
says
she
hopes
you
're
getting
on
all
right
with
Minnie
,

Paul
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
'm
all
right
,
an

I
wish

she
was

answered
Morel
.
``
But
*NL*
Minnie

a
good
little
wench

bless

''
He
sat
looking
dismal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
have
to
be
going
at
half-past
three
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

a
trapse

Eight

An

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
see
what
the
doctors
say
to-morrow
,
''
Paul
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
sighed
deeply
.
The
house
seemed
strangely
empty
,
and
Paul
thought
*NL*
his
father
looked
lost
,
forlorn
,
and
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
go
and
see
her
next
week

father
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
she
'll
be
a-whoam
by
that
time
,
''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
's
not
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
then
you
must
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dunno
wheer
I
s
'll
find
th

money
,
''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'll
write
to
you
what
the
doctor
says
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tha
writes
i
'
such
a
fashion

I
canna
ma'e
it
out

''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
write
plain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
good
asking
Morel
to
answer
,
for
he
could
scarcely
do
more
*NL*
than
write
his
own
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
came
.
Leonard
felt
it
his
duty
to
meet
him
with
a
cab
.
The
*NL*
examination
did
not
take
long
.
Annie
,
Arthur
,
Paul
,
and
Leonard
were
*NL*
waiting
in
the
parlour
anxiously
.
The
doctors
came
down
.
Paul
glanced
at
*NL*
them
.
He
had
never
had
any
hope
,
except
when
he
had
deceived
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
MAY
be
a
tumour
;
we
must
wait
and
see
,
''
said
Dr.
Jameson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
it
is
,
''
said
Annie
,
``
can
you
sweal
it
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Probably
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
put
eight
sovereigns
and
half
a
sovereign
on
the
table
.
The
doctor
*NL*
counted
them
,
took
a
florin
out
of
his
purse
,
and
put
that
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
!
''
he
said
.
``
I
'm
sorry
Mrs.
Morel
is
so
ill
.
But
we
must
see
*NL*
what
we
can
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
ca
n't
be
an
operation
?
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
even
if
there
could
,
her
heart
would
n't
stand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
her
heart
risky
?
''
asked
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
must
be
careful
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
risky
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
er
--
no
,
no
!
Just
take
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
doctor
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Paul
carried
his
mother
downstairs
.
She
lay
simply
,
like
a
*NL*
child
.
But
when
he
was
on
the
stairs
,
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
*NL*
clinging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
frightened
of
these
beastly
stairs
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
was
frightened
,
too
.
He
would
let
Leonard
do
it
another
time
.
He
*NL*
felt
he
could
not
carry
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
thinks
it
's
only
a
tumour
!
''
cried
Annie
to
her
mother
.
``
And
he
can
*NL*
sweal
it
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
KNEW
he
could
,
''
protested
Mrs.
Morel
scornfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pretended
not
to
notice
that
Paul
had
gone
out
of
the
room
.
He
sat
*NL*
in
the
kitchen
,
smoking
.
Then
he
tried
to
brush
some
grey
ash
off
his
*NL*
coat
.
He
looked
again
.
It
was
one
of
his
mother
's
grey
hairs
.
It
was
*NL*
so
long
!
He
held
it
up
,
and
it
drifted
into
the
chimney
.
He
let
go
.
The
*NL*
long
grey
hair
floated
and
was
gone
in
the
blackness
of
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
he
kissed
her
before
going
back
to
work
.
It
was
very
early
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
and
they
were
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
fret
,
my
boy
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
it
would
be
silly
.
And
take
care
of
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
answered
.
Then
,
after
a
while
:
``
And
I
shall
come
next
*NL*
Saturday
,
and
shall
bring
my
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
he
wants
to
come
,
''
she
replied
.
``
At
any
rate
,
if
he
does
*NL*
you
'll
have
to
let
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
again
,
and
stroked
the
hair
from
her
temples
,
gently
,
*NL*
tenderly
,
as
if
she
were
a
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sha
n't
you
be
late
?
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
,
''
he
said
,
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
he
sat
a
few
minutes
,
stroking
the
brown
and
grey
hair
from
her
*NL*
temples
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
wo
n't
be
any
worse
,
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
promise
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
wo
n't
be
any
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
,
held
her
in
his
arms
for
a
moment
,
and
was
gone
.
In
the
*NL*
early
sunny
morning
he
ran
to
the
station
,
crying
all
the
way
;
he
*NL*
did
not
know
what
for
.
And
her
blue
eyes
were
wide
and
staring
as
she
*NL*
thought
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
he
went
a
walk
with
Clara
.
They
sat
in
the
little
wood
*NL*
where
bluebells
were
standing
.
He
took
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
see
,
''
he
said
to
Clara
,
``
she
'll
never
be
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
do
n't
know
!
''
replied
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
caught
him
impulsively
to
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
and
forget
it
,
dear
,
''
she
said
;
``
try
and
forget
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
breast
was
there
,
warm
for
him
;
her
hands
were
in
his
hair
.
It
was
*NL*
comforting
,
and
he
held
his
arms
round
her
.
But
he
did
not
forget
.
He
*NL*
only
talked
to
Clara
of
something
else
.
And
it
was
always
so
.
When
she
*NL*
felt
it
coming
,
the
agony
,
she
cried
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
of
it
,
Paul
!
Do
n't
think
of
it
,
my
darling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
pressed
him
to
her
breast
,
rocked
him
,
soothed
him
like
a
*NL*
child
.
So
he
put
the
trouble
aside
for
her
sake
,
to
take
it
up
again
*NL*
immediately
he
was
alone
.
All
the
time
,
as
he
went
about
,
he
cried
*NL*
mechanically
.
His
mind
and
hands
were
busy
.
He
cried
,
he
did
not
know
*NL*
why
.
It
was
his
blood
weeping
.
He
was
just
as
much
alone
whether
he
was
*NL*
with
Clara
or
with
the
men
in
the
White
Horse
.
Just
himself
and
this
*NL*
pressure
inside
him
,
that
was
all
that
existed
.
He
read
sometimes
.
He
*NL*
had
to
keep
his
mind
occupied
.
And
Clara
was
a
way
of
occupying
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Saturday
Walter
Morel
went
to
Sheffield
.
He
was
a
forlorn
figure
,
*NL*
looking
rather
as
if
nobody
owned
him
.
Paul
ran
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
's
come
,
''
he
said
,
kissing
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
he
?
''
she
answered
wearily
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
collier
came
rather
frightened
into
the
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dun
I
find
thee
,
lass
?
''
he
said
,
going
forward
and
kissing
her
in
a
*NL*
hasty
,
timid
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
middlin
'
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
tha
art
,
''
he
said
.
He
stood
looking
down
on
her
.
Then
he
wiped
*NL*
his
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
.
Helpless
,
and
as
if
nobody
owned
him
,
he
*NL*
looked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
gone
on
all
right
?
''
asked
the
wife
,
rather
wearily
,
as
if
it
*NL*
were
an
effort
to
talk
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yis
,
''
he
answered
.
''
`
Er
's
a
bit
behint-hand
now
and
again
,
as
yer
might
*NL*
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
have
your
dinner
ready
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
`
ad
to
shout
at
`
er
once
or
twice
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
MUST
shout
at
her
if
she
's
not
ready
.
She
WILL
leave
things
to
*NL*
the
last
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
a
few
instructions
.
He
sat
looking
at
her
as
if
she
were
*NL*
almost
a
stranger
to
him
,
before
whom
he
was
awkward
and
humble
,
and
*NL*
also
as
if
he
had
lost
his
presence
of
mind
,
and
wanted
to
run
.
This
*NL*
feeling
that
he
wanted
to
run
away
,
that
he
was
on
thorns
to
be
gone
*NL*
from
so
trying
a
situation
,
and
yet
must
linger
because
it
looked
*NL*
better
,
made
his
presence
so
trying
.
He
put
up
his
eyebrows
for
misery
,
*NL*
and
clenched
his
fists
on
his
knees
,
feeling
so
awkward
in
presence
of
*NL*
big
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
did
not
change
much
.
She
stayed
in
Sheffield
for
two
months
.
*NL*
If
anything
,
at
the
end
she
was
rather
worse
.
But
she
wanted
to
go
home
.
*NL*
Annie
had
her
children
.
Mrs.
Morel
wanted
to
go
home
.
So
they
got
a
*NL*
motor-car
from
Nottingham
--
for
she
was
too
ill
to
go
by
train
--
and
she
*NL*
was
driven
through
the
sunshine
.
It
was
just
August
;
everything
was
*NL*
bright
and
warm
.
Under
the
blue
sky
they
could
all
see
she
was
dying
.
*NL*
Yet
she
was
jollier
than
she
had
been
for
weeks
.
They
all
laughed
and
*NL*
talked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
I
saw
a
lizard
dart
on
that
rock
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
so
quick
;
she
was
still
so
full
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
knew
she
was
coming
.
He
had
the
front
door
open
.
Everybody
was
on
*NL*
tiptoe
.
Half
the
street
turned
out
.
They
heard
the
sound
of
the
great
*NL*
motor-car
.
Mrs.
Morel
,
smiling
,
drove
home
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
just
look
at
them
all
come
out
to
see
me
!
''
she
said
.
``
But
there
,
*NL*
I
suppose
I
should
have
done
the
same
.
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Mathews
?
How
*NL*
are
you
,
Mrs.
Harrison
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
none
of
them
could
hear
,
but
they
saw
her
smile
and
nod
.
And
*NL*
they
all
saw
death
on
her
face
,
they
said
.
It
was
a
great
event
in
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
wanted
to
carry
her
indoors
,
but
he
was
too
old
.
Arthur
took
her
*NL*
as
if
she
were
a
child
.
They
had
set
her
a
big
,
deep
chair
by
the
*NL*
hearth
where
her
rocking-chair
used
to
stand
.
When
she
was
unwrapped
and
*NL*
seated
,
and
had
drunk
a
little
brandy
,
she
looked
round
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
I
do
n't
like
your
house
,
Annie
,
''
she
said
;
``
but
it
's
nice
*NL*
to
be
in
my
own
home
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Morel
answered
huskily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
lass
,
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Minnie
,
the
little
quaint
maid
,
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
we
glad
t
'
`
ave
yer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
lovely
yellow
ravel
of
sunflowers
in
the
garden
.
She
looked
*NL*
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
my
sunflowers
!
''
she
said
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
RELEASE
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
''
said
Dr.
Ansell
one
evening
when
Morel
was
in
*NL*
Sheffield
,
``
we
've
got
a
man
in
the
fever
hospital
here
who
comes
from
*NL*
Nottingham
--
Dawes
.
He
does
n't
seem
to
have
many
belongings
in
this
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Baxter
Dawes
!
''
Paul
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
man
--
has
been
a
fine
fellow
,
physically
,
I
should
think
.
*NL*
Been
in
a
bit
of
a
mess
lately
.
You
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
used
to
work
at
the
place
where
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
?
Do
you
know
anything
about
him
?
He
's
just
sulking
,
or
he
'd
be
a
*NL*
lot
better
than
he
is
by
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
of
his
home
circumstances
,
except
that
he
's
*NL*
separated
from
his
wife
and
has
been
a
bit
down
,
I
believe
.
But
tell
him
*NL*
about
me
,
will
you
?
Tell
him
I
'll
come
and
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
time
Morel
saw
the
doctor
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
about
Dawes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
to
him
,
''
answered
the
other
,
''
`
Do
you
know
a
man
from
Nottingham
*NL*
named
Morel
?
'
and
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
'd
jump
at
my
throat
.
So
I
*NL*
said
:
'
I
see
you
know
the
name
;
it
's
Paul
Morel
.
'
Then
I
told
him
about
*NL*
your
saying
you
would
go
and
see
him
.
`
What
does
he
want
?
'
he
said
,
as
*NL*
if
you
were
a
policeman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
he
say
he
would
see
me
?
''
asked
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
would
n't
say
anything
--
good
,
bad
or
indifferent
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
want
to
know
.
There
he
lies
and
sulks
,
day
in
,
day
out
.
*NL*
Ca
n't
get
a
word
of
information
out
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
I
might
go
?
''
asked
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
feeling
of
connection
between
the
rival
men
,
more
than
ever
*NL*
since
they
had
fought
.
In
a
way
Morel
felt
guilty
towards
the
other
,
and
*NL*
more
or
less
responsible
.
And
being
in
such
a
state
of
soul
himself
,
*NL*
he
felt
an
almost
painful
nearness
to
Dawes
,
who
was
suffering
and
*NL*
despairing
,
too
.
Besides
,
they
had
met
in
a
naked
extremity
of
hate
,
and
*NL*
it
was
a
bond
.
At
any
rate
,
the
elemental
man
in
each
had
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
down
to
the
isolation
hospital
,
with
Dr.
Ansell
's
card
.
This
*NL*
sister
,
a
healthy
young
Irishwoman
,
led
him
down
the
ward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
visitor
to
see
you
,
Jim
Crow
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
turned
over
suddenly
with
a
startled
grunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caw
!
''
she
mocked
.
``
He
can
only
say
`
Caw
!
'
I
have
brought
you
a
*NL*
gentleman
to
see
you
.
Now
say
`
Thank
you
,
'
and
show
some
manners
.

*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
looked
swiftly
with
his
dark
,
startled
eyes
beyond
the
sister
at
*NL*
Paul
.
His
look
was
full
of
fear
,
mistrust
,
hate
,
and
misery
.
Morel
met
*NL*
the
swift
,
dark
eyes
,
and
hesitated
.
The
two
men
were
afraid
of
the
*NL*
naked
selves
they
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Ansell
told
me
you
were
here
,
''
said
Morel
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
mechanically
shook
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
thought
I
'd
come
in
,
''
continued
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
.
Dawes
lay
staring
at
the
opposite
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
`
Caw
!
''
'
mocked
the
nurse
.
``
Say
`
Caw
!
'
Jim
Crow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
getting
on
all
right
?
''
said
Paul
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
He
lies
and
imagines
he
's
going
to
die
,
''
said
the
nurse
,
``
and
*NL*
it
frightens
every
word
out
of
his
mouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
MUST
have
somebody
to
talk
to
,
''
laughed
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
!
''
laughed
the
nurse
.
``
Only
two
old
men
and
a
boy
who
always
*NL*
cries
.
It
is
hard
lines
!
Here
am
I
dying
to
hear
Jim
Crow
's
voice
,
and
*NL*
nothing
but
an
odd
`
Caw
!
'
will
he
give
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
rough
on
you
!
''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
?
''
said
the
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
am
a
godsend
,
''
he
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dropped
straight
from
heaven
!
''
laughed
the
nurse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
left
the
two
men
alone
.
Dawes
was
thinner
,
and
handsome
*NL*
again
,
but
life
seemed
low
in
him
.
As
the
doctor
said
,
he
was
lying
*NL*
sulking
,
and
would
not
move
forward
towards
convalescence
.
He
seemed
to
*NL*
grudge
every
beat
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
had
a
bad
time
?
''
asked
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
again
Dawes
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
in
Sheffield
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mother
was
taken
ill
at
my
sister
's
in
Thurston
Street
.
What
are
you
*NL*
doing
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
have
you
been
in
?
''
Morel
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
say
for
sure
,
''
Dawes
answered
grudgingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lay
staring
across
at
the
wall
opposite
,
as
if
trying
to
believe
*NL*
Morel
was
not
there
.
Paul
felt
his
heart
go
hard
and
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Ansell
told
me
you
were
here
,
''
he
said
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
man
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Typhoid
's
pretty
bad
,
I
know
,
''
Morel
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Dawes
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
come
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
Dr.
Ansell
said
you
did
n't
know
anybody
here
.
Do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nobody
nowhere
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
it
's
because
you
do
n't
choose
to
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
s
'll
be
taking
my
mother
home
as
soon
as
we
can
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a-matter
with
her
?
''
asked
Dawes
,
with
a
sick
man
's
interest
in
*NL*
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
got
a
cancer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
another
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
want
to
get
her
home
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
We
s
'll
have
to
get
a
*NL*
motor-car
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
lay
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
ask
Thomas
Jordan
to
lend
you
his
?
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
big
enough
,
''
Morel
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
blinked
his
dark
eyes
as
he
lay
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
ask
Jack
Pilkington
;
he
'd
lend
it
you
.
You
know
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
s
'll
hire
one
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
fool
if
you
do
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sick
man
was
gaunt
and
handsome
again
.
Paul
was
sorry
for
him
*NL*
because
his
eyes
looked
so
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
get
a
job
here
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
only
here
a
day
or
two
before
I
was
taken
bad
,
''
Dawes
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
to
get
in
a
convalescent
home
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
's
face
clouded
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
goin
'
in
no
convalescent
home
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
's
been
in
the
one
at
Seathorpe
,
an
'
he
liked
it
.
Dr.
Ansell
*NL*
would
get
you
a
recommend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
lay
thinking
.
It
was
evident
he
dared
not
face
the
world
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
seaside
would
be
all
right
just
now
,
''
Morel
said
.
``
Sun
on
those
*NL*
sandhills
,
and
the
waves
not
far
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Gad
!
''
Paul
concluded
,
too
miserable
to
bother
much
;
``
it
's
all
right
*NL*
when
you
know
you
're
going
to
walk
again
,
and
swim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
glanced
at
him
quickly
.
The
man
's
dark
eyes
were
afraid
to
meet
*NL*
any
other
eyes
in
the
world
.
But
the
real
misery
and
helplessness
in
*NL*
Paul
's
tone
gave
him
a
feeling
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
far
gone
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
going
like
wax
,
''
Paul
answered
;
``
but
cheerful
--
lively
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bit
his
lip
.
After
a
minute
he
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
be
going
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
'll
leave
you
this
half-crown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
it
,
''
Dawes
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
did
not
answer
,
but
left
the
coin
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'll
try
and
run
in
when
I
'm
back
in
Sheffield
.
Happen
*NL*
you
might
like
to
see
my
brother-in-law
?
He
works
in
Pyecrofts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
him
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
all
right
.
Should
I
tell
him
to
come
?
He
might
bring
you
some
*NL*
papers
to
look
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
man
did
not
answer
.
Paul
went
.
The
strong
emotion
that
Dawes
*NL*
aroused
in
him
,
repressed
,
made
him
shiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
tell
his
mother
,
but
next
day
he
spoke
to
Clara
about
this
*NL*
interview
.
It
was
in
the
dinner-hour
.
The
two
did
not
often
go
out
*NL*
together
now
,
but
this
day
he
asked
her
to
go
with
him
to
the
Castle
*NL*
grounds
.
There
they
sat
while
the
scarlet
geraniums
and
the
yellow
*NL*
calceolarias
blazed
in
the
sunlight
.
She
was
now
always
rather
*NL*
protective
,
and
rather
resentful
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
know
Baxter
was
in
Sheffield
Hospital
with
typhoid
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
with
startled
grey
eyes
,
and
her
face
went
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
getting
better
.
I
went
to
see
him
yesterday
--
the
doctor
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
seemed
stricken
by
the
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
very
bad
?
''
she
asked
guiltily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
.
He
's
mending
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he
say
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
!
He
seems
to
be
sulking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
distance
between
the
two
of
them
.
He
gave
her
more
*NL*
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
about
shut
up
and
silent
.
The
next
time
they
took
a
walk
*NL*
together
,
she
disengaged
herself
from
his
arm
,
and
walked
at
a
distance
*NL*
from
him
.
He
was
wanting
her
comfort
badly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
be
nice
with
me
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
he
said
,
putting
his
arm
across
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
!
''
she
said
,
disengaging
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
her
alone
,
and
returned
to
his
own
brooding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Baxter
that
upsets
you
?
''
he
asked
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
HAVE
been
VILE
to
him
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
said
many
a
time
you
have
n't
treated
him
well
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
a
hostility
between
them
.
Each
pursued
his
own
train
of
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
treated
him
--
no
,
I
've
treated
him
badly
,
''
she
said
.
``
And
now
you
*NL*
treat
ME
badly
.
It
serves
me
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
I
treat
you
badly
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
serves
me
right
,
''
she
repeated
.
``
I
never
considered
him
worth
*NL*
having
,
and
now
you
do
n't
consider
ME
.
But
it
serves
me
right
.
He
loved
*NL*
me
a
thousand
times
better
than
you
ever
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
!
''
protested
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
!
At
any
rate
,
he
did
respect
me
,
and
that
's
what
you
do
n't
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looked
as
if
he
respected
you
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
!
And
I
MADE
him
horrid
--
I
know
I
did
!
You
've
taught
me
that
.
And
*NL*
he
loved
me
a
thousand
times
better
than
ever
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
only
wanted
to
be
left
alone
now
.
He
had
his
own
trouble
,
which
was
*NL*
almost
too
much
to
bear
.
Clara
only
tormented
him
and
made
him
tired
.
He
*NL*
was
not
sorry
when
he
left
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
the
first
opportunity
to
Sheffield
to
see
her
husband
.
The
*NL*
meeting
was
not
a
success
.
But
she
left
him
roses
and
fruit
and
money
.
*NL*
She
wanted
to
make
restitution
.
It
was
not
that
she
loved
him
.
As
she
*NL*
looked
at
him
lying
there
her
heart
did
not
warm
with
love
.
Only
she
*NL*
wanted
to
humble
herself
to
him
,
to
kneel
before
him
.
She
wanted
now
to
*NL*
be
self-sacrificial
.
After
all
,
she
had
failed
to
make
Morel
really
*NL*
love
her
.
She
was
morally
frightened
.
She
wanted
to
do
penance
.
So
she
*NL*
kneeled
to
Dawes
,
and
it
gave
him
a
subtle
pleasure
.
But
the
distance
*NL*
between
them
was
still
very
great
--
too
great
.
It
frightened
the
man
.
It
*NL*
almost
pleased
the
woman
.
She
liked
to
feel
she
was
serving
him
across
*NL*
an
insuperable
distance
.
She
was
proud
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
went
to
see
Dawes
once
or
twice
.
There
was
a
sort
of
friendship
*NL*
between
the
two
men
,
who
were
all
the
while
deadly
rivals
.
But
they
*NL*
never
mentioned
the
woman
who
was
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Morel
got
gradually
worse
.
At
first
they
used
to
carry
her
*NL*
downstairs
,
sometimes
even
into
the
garden
.
She
sat
propped
in
her
*NL*
chair
,
smiling
,
and
so
pretty
.
The
gold
wedding-ring
shone
on
her
*NL*
white
hand
;
her
hair
was
carefully
brushed
.
And
she
watched
the
tangled
*NL*
sunflowers
dying
,
the
chrysanthemums
coming
out
,
and
the
dahlias
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
and
she
were
afraid
of
each
other
.
He
knew
,
and
she
knew
,
that
she
*NL*
was
dying
.
But
they
kept
up
a
pretence
of
cheerfulness
.
Every
morning
,
*NL*
when
he
got
up
,
he
went
into
her
room
in
his
pyjamas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
sleep
,
my
dear
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
knew
she
had
lain
awake
.
He
saw
her
hand
under
the
bedclothes
,
*NL*
pressing
the
place
on
her
side
where
the
pain
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
it
been
bad
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
It
hurt
a
bit
,
but
nothing
to
mention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
sniffed
in
her
old
scornful
way
.
As
she
lay
she
looked
like
a
*NL*
girl
.
And
all
the
while
her
blue
eyes
watched
him
.
But
there
were
the
*NL*
dark
pain-circles
beneath
that
made
him
ache
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
sunny
day
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
beautiful
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
you
'll
be
carried
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
away
to
get
her
breakfast
.
All
day
long
he
was
conscious
of
*NL*
nothing
but
her
.
It
was
a
long
ache
that
made
him
feverish
.
Then
,
when
*NL*
he
got
home
in
the
early
evening
,
he
glanced
through
the
kitchen
window
.
*NL*
She
was
not
there
;
she
had
not
got
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
straight
upstairs
and
kissed
her
.
He
was
almost
afraid
to
ask
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
you
get
up
,
pigeon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
``
it
was
that
morphia
;
it
made
me
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
gives
you
too
much
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
does
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
by
the
bed
,
miserably
.
She
had
a
way
of
curling
and
lying
on
*NL*
her
side
,
like
a
child
.
The
grey
and
brown
hair
was
loose
over
her
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
it
tickle
you
?
''
he
said
,
gently
putting
it
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
was
near
hers
.
Her
blue
eyes
smiled
straight
into
his
,
like
a
*NL*
girl
's
--
warm
,
laughing
with
tender
love
.
It
made
him
pant
with
terror
,
*NL*
agony
,
and
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
want
your
hair
doing
in
a
plait
,
''
he
said
.
``
Lie
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
going
behind
her
,
he
carefully
loosened
her
hair
,
brushed
it
out
.
It
*NL*
was
like
fine
long
silk
of
brown
and
grey
.
Her
head
was
snuggled
between
*NL*
her
shoulders
.
As
he
lightly
brushed
and
plaited
her
hair
,
he
bit
his
*NL*
lip
and
felt
dazed
.
It
all
seemed
unreal
,
he
could
not
understand
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
night
he
often
worked
in
her
room
,
looking
up
from
time
to
time
.
And
*NL*
so
often
he
found
her
blue
eyes
fixed
on
him
.
And
when
their
eyes
met
,
*NL*
she
smiled
.
He
worked
away
again
mechanically
,
producing
good
stuff
*NL*
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
came
in
,
very
pale
and
still
,
with
watchful
,
sudden
eyes
,
*NL*
like
a
man
who
is
drunk
almost
to
death
.
They
were
both
afraid
of
the
*NL*
veils
that
were
ripping
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
pretended
to
be
better
,
chattered
to
him
gaily
,
made
a
great
*NL*
fuss
over
some
scraps
of
news
.
For
they
had
both
come
to
the
condition
*NL*
when
they
had
to
make
much
of
the
trifles
,
lest
they
should
give
in
to
*NL*
the
big
thing
,
and
their
human
independence
would
go
smash
.
They
were
*NL*
afraid
,
so
they
made
light
of
things
and
were
gay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
as
she
lay
he
knew
she
was
thinking
of
the
past
.
Her
mouth
*NL*
gradually
shut
hard
in
a
line
.
She
was
holding
herself
rigid
,
so
that
*NL*
she
might
die
without
ever
uttering
the
great
cry
that
was
tearing
from
*NL*
her
.
He
never
forgot
that
hard
,
utterly
lonely
and
stubborn
clenching
*NL*
of
her
mouth
,
which
persisted
for
weeks
.
Sometimes
,
when
it
was
lighter
,
*NL*
she
talked
about
her
husband
.
Now
she
hated
him
.
She
did
not
forgive
*NL*
him
.
She
could
not
bear
him
to
be
in
the
room
.
And
a
few
things
,
the
*NL*
things
that
had
been
most
bitter
to
her
,
came
up
again
so
strongly
that
*NL*
they
broke
from
her
,
and
she
told
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
as
if
his
life
were
being
destroyed
,
piece
by
piece
,
within
him
.
*NL*
Often
the
tears
came
suddenly
.
He
ran
to
the
station
,
the
tear-drops
*NL*
falling
on
the
pavement
.
Often
he
could
not
go
on
with
his
work
.
The
*NL*
pen
stopped
writing
.
He
sat
staring
,
quite
unconscious
.
And
when
he
came
*NL*
round
again
he
felt
sick
,
and
trembled
in
his
limbs
.
He
never
questioned
*NL*
what
it
was
.
His
mind
did
not
try
to
analyse
or
understand
.
He
merely
*NL*
submitted
,
and
kept
his
eyes
shut
;
let
the
thing
go
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
did
the
same
.
She
thought
of
the
pain
,
of
the
morphia
,
of
the
*NL*
next
day
;
hardly
ever
of
the
death
.
That
was
coming
,
she
knew
.
She
had
*NL*
to
submit
to
it
.
But
she
would
never
entreat
it
or
make
friends
with
*NL*
it
.
Blind
,
with
her
face
shut
hard
and
blind
,
she
was
pushed
towards
the
*NL*
door
.
The
days
passed
,
the
weeks
,
the
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
in
the
sunny
afternoons
,
she
seemed
almost
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
try
to
think
of
the
nice
times
--
when
we
went
to
Mablethorpe
,
and
*NL*
Robin
Hood
's
Bay
,
and
Shanklin
,
''
she
said
.
``
After
all
,
not
everybody
has
*NL*
seen
those
beautiful
places
.
And
was
n't
it
beautiful
!
I
try
to
think
of
*NL*
that
,
not
of
the
other
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
again
,
for
a
whole
evening
she
spoke
not
a
word
;
neither
did
he
.
*NL*
They
were
together
,
rigid
,
stubborn
,
silent
.
He
went
into
his
room
*NL*
at
last
to
go
to
bed
,
and
leaned
against
the
doorway
as
if
paralysed
,
*NL*
unable
to
go
any
farther
.
His
consciousness
went
.
A
furious
storm
,
he
*NL*
knew
not
what
,
seemed
to
ravage
inside
him
.
He
stood
leaning
there
,
*NL*
submitting
,
never
questioning
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
they
were
both
normal
again
,
though
her
face
was
grey
*NL*
with
the
morphia
,
and
her
body
felt
like
ash
.
But
they
were
bright
*NL*
again
,
nevertheless
.
Often
,
especially
if
Annie
or
Arthur
were
at
home
,
*NL*
he
neglected
her
.
He
did
not
see
much
of
Clara
.
Usually
he
was
with
*NL*
men
.
He
was
quick
and
active
and
lively
;
but
when
his
friends
saw
him
*NL*
go
white
to
the
gills
,
his
eyes
dark
and
glittering
,
they
had
a
certain
*NL*
mistrust
of
him
.
Sometimes
he
went
to
Clara
,
but
she
was
almost
cold
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
me
!
''
he
said
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
she
would
.
But
she
was
afraid
.
When
he
had
her
then
,
*NL*
there
was
something
in
it
that
made
her
shrink
away
from
him
--
something
*NL*
unnatural
.
She
grew
to
dread
him
.
He
was
so
quiet
,
yet
so
strange
.
She
*NL*
was
afraid
of
the
man
who
was
not
there
with
her
,
whom
she
could
feel
*NL*
behind
this
make-belief
lover
;
somebody
sinister
,
that
filled
her
with
*NL*
horror
.
She
began
to
have
a
kind
of
horror
of
him
.
It
was
almost
as
if
*NL*
he
were
a
criminal
.
He
wanted
her
--
he
had
her
--
and
it
made
her
feel
as
*NL*
if
death
itself
had
her
in
its
grip
.
She
lay
in
horror
.
There
was
no
*NL*
man
there
loving
her
.
She
almost
hated
him
.
Then
came
little
bouts
of
*NL*
tenderness
.
But
she
dared
not
pity
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
had
come
to
Colonel
Seely
's
Home
near
Nottingham
.
There
Paul
*NL*
visited
him
sometimes
,
Clara
very
occasionally
.
Between
the
two
men
*NL*
the
friendship
developed
peculiarly
.
Dawes
,
who
mended
very
slowly
and
*NL*
seemed
very
feeble
,
seemed
to
leave
himself
in
the
hands
of
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
beginning
of
November
Clara
reminded
Paul
that
it
was
her
*NL*
birthday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
nearly
forgotten
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
thought
quite
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Shall
we
go
to
the
seaside
for
the
week-end
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
.
It
was
cold
and
rather
dismal
.
She
waited
for
him
to
be
warm
*NL*
and
tender
with
her
,
instead
of
which
he
seemed
hardly
aware
of
her
.
*NL*
He
sat
in
the
railway-carriage
,
looking
out
,
and
was
startled
when
she
*NL*
spoke
to
him
.
He
was
not
definitely
thinking
.
Things
seemed
as
if
they
*NL*
did
not
exist
.
She
went
across
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
dear
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
!
''
he
said
.
``
Do
n't
those
windmill
sails
look
monotonous
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
holding
her
hand
.
He
could
not
talk
nor
think
.
It
was
a
comfort
,
*NL*
however
,
to
sit
holding
her
hand
.
She
was
dissatisfied
and
miserable
.
He
*NL*
was
not
with
her
;
she
was
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
evening
they
sat
among
the
sandhills
,
looking
at
the
black
,
*NL*
heavy
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
never
give
in
,
''
he
said
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
's
heart
sank
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
different
ways
of
dying
.
My
father
's
people
are
frightened
,
*NL*
and
have
to
be
hauled
out
of
life
into
death
like
cattle
into
a
*NL*
slaughter-house
,
pulled
by
the
neck
;
but
my
mother
's
people
are
pushed
*NL*
from
behind
,
inch
by
inch
.
They
are
stubborn
people
,
and
wo
n't
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
wo
n't
die
.
She
ca
n't
.
Mr.
Renshaw
,
the
parson
,
was
in
the
other
*NL*
day
.
`
Think
!
'
he
said
to
her
;
`
you
will
have
your
mother
and
father
,
and
*NL*
your
sisters
,
and
your
son
,
in
the
Other
Land
.
'
And
she
said
:
'
I
have
*NL*
done
without
them
for
a
long
time
,
and
CAN
do
without
them
now
.
It
is
*NL*
the
living
I
want
,
not
the
dead
.
'
She
wants
to
live
even
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
horrible
!
''
said
Clara
,
too
frightened
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
looks
at
me
,
and
she
wants
to
stay
with
me
,
''
he
went
on
*NL*
monotonously
.
``
She
's
got
such
a
will
,
it
seems
as
if
she
would
never
*NL*
go
--
never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
of
it
!
''
cried
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
was
religious
--
she
is
religious
now
--
but
it
is
no
good
.
She
*NL*
simply
wo
n't
give
in
.
And
do
you
know
,
I
said
to
her
on
Thursday
:
*NL*
`
Mother
,
if
I
had
to
die
,
I
'd
die
.
I
'd
WILL
to
die
.
'
And
she
said
to
*NL*
me
,
sharp
:
`
Do
you
think
I
have
n't
?
Do
you
think
you
can
die
when
you
*NL*
like
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
ceased
.
He
did
not
cry
,
only
went
on
speaking
monotonously
.
*NL*
Clara
wanted
to
run
.
She
looked
round
.
There
was
the
black
,
re-echoing
*NL*
shore
,
the
dark
sky
down
on
her
.
She
got
up
terrified
.
She
wanted
to
be
*NL*
where
there
was
light
,
where
there
were
other
people
.
She
wanted
to
be
*NL*
away
from
him
.
He
sat
with
his
head
dropped
,
not
moving
a
muscle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
do
n't
want
her
to
eat
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
she
knows
it
.
When
I
ask
*NL*
her
:
`
Shall
you
have
anything
'
she
's
almost
afraid
to
say
`
Yes
.
'
`
I
'll
*NL*
have
a
cup
of
Benger
's
,
'
she
says
.
`
It
'll
only
keep
your
strength
up
,
'
*NL*
I
said
to
her
.
`
Yes
'
--
and
she
almost
cried
--
`
but
there
's
such
a
gnawing
*NL*
when
I
eat
nothing
,
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
'
So
I
went
and
made
her
the
food
.
*NL*
It
's
the
cancer
that
gnaws
like
that
at
her
.
I
wish
she
'd
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
Clara
roughly
.
``
I
'm
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
her
down
the
darkness
of
the
sands
.
He
did
not
come
to
her
.
*NL*
He
seemed
scarcely
aware
of
her
existence
.
And
she
was
afraid
of
him
,
*NL*
and
disliked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
acute
daze
they
went
back
to
Nottingham
.
He
was
always
*NL*
busy
,
always
doing
something
,
always
going
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
*NL*
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Monday
he
went
to
see
Baxter
Dawes
.
Listless
and
pale
,
the
man
*NL*
rose
to
greet
the
other
,
clinging
to
his
chair
as
he
held
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
get
up
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
sat
down
heavily
,
eyeing
Morel
with
a
sort
of
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
waste
your
time
on
me
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
you
've
owt
better
to
*NL*
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
come
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
Here
!
I
brought
you
some
sweets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
invalid
put
them
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
been
much
of
a
week-end
,
''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
your
mother
?
''
asked
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardly
any
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
she
was
perhaps
worse
,
being
as
you
did
n't
come
on
Sunday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
at
Skegness
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
I
wanted
a
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
looked
at
him
with
dark
eyes
.
He
seemed
to
be
waiting
,
not
*NL*
quite
daring
to
ask
,
trusting
to
be
told
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
with
Clara
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
as
much
,
''
said
Dawes
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
an
old
promise
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
it
your
own
way
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
Clara
had
been
definitely
mentioned
between
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Morel
slowly
;
``
she
's
tired
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Dawes
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
August
she
's
been
getting
tired
of
me
,
''
Morel
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
were
very
quiet
together
.
Paul
suggested
a
game
of
draughts
.
*NL*
They
played
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
go
abroad
when
my
mother
's
dead
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Abroad
!
''
repeated
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
do
n't
care
what
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
continued
the
game
.
Dawes
was
winning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
have
to
begin
a
new
start
of
some
sort
,
''
said
Paul
;
``
and
you
as
*NL*
well
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
one
of
Dawes
's
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dunno
where
,
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
have
to
happen
,
''
Morel
said
.
``
It
's
no
good
doing
anything
--
at
*NL*
least
--
no
,
I
do
n't
know
.
Give
me
some
toffee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
ate
sweets
,
and
began
another
game
of
draughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made
that
scar
on
your
mouth
?
''
asked
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
put
his
hand
hastily
to
his
lips
,
and
looked
over
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
bicycle
accident
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
's
hand
trembled
as
he
moved
the
piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
n't
ha
'
laughed
at
me
,
''
he
said
,
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
night
on
Woodborough
Road
,
when
you
and
her
passed
me
--
you
with
*NL*
your
hand
on
her
shoulder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
laughed
at
you
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
kept
his
fingers
on
the
draught-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
knew
you
were
there
till
the
very
second
when
you
passed
,
''
said
*NL*
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
that
as
did
me
,
''
Dawes
said
,
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
took
another
sweet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
laughed
,
''
he
said
,
``
except
as
I
'm
always
laughing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
finished
the
game
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
Morel
walked
home
from
Nottingham
,
in
order
to
have
something
*NL*
to
do
.
The
furnaces
flared
in
a
red
blotch
over
Bulwell
;
the
black
*NL*
clouds
were
like
a
low
ceiling
.
As
he
went
along
the
ten
miles
of
*NL*
highroad
,
he
felt
as
if
he
were
walking
out
of
life
,
between
the
black
*NL*
levels
of
the
sky
and
the
earth
.
But
at
the
end
was
only
the
sick-room
.
*NL*
If
he
walked
and
walked
for
ever
,
there
was
only
that
place
to
come
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
tired
when
he
got
near
home
,
or
He
did
not
know
it
.
Across
*NL*
the
field
he
could
see
the
red
firelight
leaping
in
her
bedroom
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
she
's
dead
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
that
fire
will
go
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
off
his
boots
quietly
and
crept
upstairs
.
His
mothers
door
was
*NL*
wide
open
,
because
she
slept
alone
still
.
The
red
firelight
dashed
its
*NL*
glow
on
the
landing
.
Soft
as
a
shadow
,
he
peeped
in
her
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
!
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
heart
seemed
to
break
again
.
He
went
in
and
sat
by
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
late
you
are
!
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
very
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
time
is
it
?
''
The
murmur
came
plaintive
and
helpless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
just
gone
eleven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
not
true
;
it
was
nearly
one
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
said
;
``
I
thought
it
was
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
knew
the
unutterable
misery
of
her
nights
that
would
not
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
sleep
,
my
pigeon
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
ca
n't
,
''
she
wailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
Little
!
''
He
said
crooning
.
``
Never
mind
,
my
love
.
I
'll
stop
*NL*
with
you
half
an
hour
,
my
pigeon
;
then
perhaps
it
will
be
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
sat
by
the
bedside
,
slowly
,
rhythmically
stroking
her
brows
*NL*
with
his
finger-tips
,
stroking
her
eyes
shut
,
soothing
her
,
holding
her
*NL*
fingers
in
his
free
hand
.
They
could
hear
the
sleepers
'
breathing
in
the
*NL*
other
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
go
to
bed
,
''
she
murmured
,
lying
quite
still
under
his
fingers
and
*NL*
his
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
sleep
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
feel
better
,
my
Little
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
like
a
fretful
,
half-soothed
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
days
and
the
weeks
went
by
.
He
hardly
ever
went
to
see
Clara
*NL*
now
.
But
he
wandered
restlessly
from
one
person
to
another
for
some
*NL*
help
,
and
there
was
none
anywhere
.
Miriam
had
written
to
him
tenderly
.
*NL*
He
went
to
see
her
.
Her
heart
was
very
sore
when
she
saw
him
,
white
,
*NL*
gaunt
,
with
his
eyes
dark
and
bewildered
.
Her
pity
came
up
,
hurting
her
*NL*
till
she
could
not
bear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
she
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
same
--
the
same
!
''
he
said
.
``
The
doctor
says
she
ca
n't
last
,
but
I
*NL*
know
she
will
.
She
'll
be
here
at
Christmas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
shuddered
.
She
drew
him
to
her
;
she
pressed
him
to
her
bosom
;
she
*NL*
kissed
him
and
kissed
him
.
He
submitted
,
but
it
was
torture
.
She
could
*NL*
not
kiss
his
agony
.
That
remained
alone
and
apart
.
She
kissed
his
face
,
*NL*
and
roused
his
blood
,
while
his
soul
was
apart
writhing
with
the
agony
*NL*
of
death
.
And
she
kissed
him
and
fingered
his
body
,
till
at
last
,
*NL*
feeling
he
would
go
mad
,
he
got
away
from
her
.
It
was
not
what
he
wanted
*NL*
just
then
--
not
that
.
And
she
thought
she
had
soothed
him
and
done
him
*NL*
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
December
came
,
and
some
snow
.
He
stayed
at
home
all
the
while
now
.
*NL*
They
could
not
afford
a
nurse
.
Annie
came
to
look
after
her
mother
;
the
*NL*
parish
nurse
,
whom
they
loved
,
came
in
morning
and
evening
.
Paul
shared
*NL*
the
nursing
with
Annie
.
Often
,
in
the
evenings
,
when
friends
were
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
with
them
,
they
all
laughed
together
and
shook
with
laughter
.
It
*NL*
was
reaction
.
Paul
was
so
comical
,
Annie
was
so
quaint
.
The
whole
party
*NL*
laughed
till
they
cried
,
trying
to
subdue
the
sound
.
And
Mrs.
Morel
,
*NL*
lying
alone
in
the
darkness
heard
them
,
and
among
her
bitterness
was
a
*NL*
feeling
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Paul
would
go
upstairs
gingerly
,
guiltily
,
to
see
if
she
had
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
give
you
some
milk
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
,
''
she
replied
plaintively
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
would
put
some
water
with
it
,
so
that
it
should
not
nourish
her
.
*NL*
Yet
he
loved
her
more
than
his
own
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
morphia
every
night
,
and
her
heart
got
fitful
.
Annie
slept
*NL*
beside
her
.
Paul
would
go
in
in
the
early
morning
,
when
his
sister
*NL*
got
up
.
His
mother
was
wasted
and
almost
ashen
in
the
morning
with
the
*NL*
morphia
.
Darker
and
darker
grew
her
eyes
,
all
pupil
,
with
the
torture
.
*NL*
In
the
mornings
the
weariness
and
ache
were
too
much
to
bear
.
Yet
she
*NL*
could
not
--
would
not
--
weep
,
or
even
complain
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
slept
a
bit
later
this
morning
,
little
one
,
''
he
would
say
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
?
''
she
answered
,
with
fretful
weariness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
's
nearly
eight
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
.
The
whole
country
was
bleak
and
*NL*
pallid
under
the
snow
.
Then
he
felt
her
pulse
.
There
was
a
strong
stroke
*NL*
and
a
weak
one
,
like
a
sound
and
its
echo
.
That
was
supposed
to
betoken
*NL*
the
end
.
She
let
him
feel
her
wrist
,
knowing
what
he
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
they
looked
in
each
other
's
eyes
.
Then
they
almost
seemed
to
*NL*
make
an
agreement
.
It
was
almost
as
if
he
were
agreeing
to
die
also
.
*NL*
But
she
did
not
consent
to
die
;
she
would
not
.
Her
body
was
wasted
to
a
*NL*
fragment
of
ash
.
Her
eyes
were
dark
and
full
of
torture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
give
her
something
to
put
an
end
to
it
?
''
he
asked
the
doctor
*NL*
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
doctor
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ca
n't
last
many
days
now
,
Mr.
Morel
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
bear
it
much
longer
;
we
shall
all
go
mad
,
''
said
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
sat
down
to
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
sit
with
her
while
we
have
breakfast
,
Minnie
,
''
said
Annie
.
But
*NL*
the
girl
was
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
through
the
country
,
through
the
woods
,
over
the
snow
.
He
saw
*NL*
the
marks
of
rabbits
and
birds
in
the
white
snow
.
He
wandered
miles
*NL*
and
miles
.
A
smoky
red
sunset
came
on
slowly
,
painfully
,
lingering
.
He
*NL*
thought
she
would
die
that
day
.
There
was
a
donkey
that
came
up
to
him
*NL*
over
the
snow
by
the
wood
's
edge
,
and
put
its
head
against
him
,
and
*NL*
walked
with
him
alongside
.
He
put
his
arms
round
the
donkey
's
neck
,
and
*NL*
stroked
his
cheeks
against
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
,
silent
,
was
still
alive
,
with
her
hard
mouth
gripped
grimly
,
*NL*
her
eyes
of
dark
torture
only
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearing
Christmas
;
there
was
more
snow
.
Annie
and
he
felt
as
if
*NL*
they
could
go
on
no
more
.
Still
her
dark
eyes
were
alive
.
Morel
,
silent
*NL*
and
frightened
,
obliterated
himself
.
Sometimes
he
would
go
into
the
*NL*
sick-room
and
look
at
her
.
Then
he
backed
out
,
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
kept
her
hold
on
life
still
.
The
miners
had
been
out
on
strike
,
and
*NL*
returned
a
fortnight
or
so
before
Christmas
.
Minnie
went
upstairs
with
*NL*
the
feeding-cup
.
It
was
two
days
after
the
men
had
been
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
the
men
been
saying
their
hands
are
sore
,
Minnie
?
''
she
asked
,
*NL*
in
the
faint
,
querulous
voice
that
would
not
give
in
.
Minnie
stood
*NL*
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
I
know
of
,
Mrs.
Morel
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
'll
bet
they
are
sore
,
''
said
the
dying
woman
,
as
she
moved
her
*NL*
head
with
a
sigh
of
weariness
.
``
But
,
at
any
rate
,
there
'll
be
something
*NL*
to
buy
in
with
this
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
thing
did
she
let
slip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
's
pit
things
will
want
well
airing
,
Annie
,
''
she
said
,
when
*NL*
the
men
were
going
back
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
bother
about
that
,
my
dear
,
''
said
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
Annie
and
Paul
were
alone
.
Nurse
was
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
live
over
Christmas
,
''
said
Annie
.
They
were
both
full
of
horror
.
*NL*
``
She
wo
n't
,
''
he
replied
grimly
.
``
I
s
'll
give
her
morphia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
?
''
said
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
came
from
Sheffield
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
--
do
!
''
said
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
he
was
painting
in
the
bedroom
.
She
seemed
to
be
asleep
.
*NL*
He
stepped
softly
backwards
and
forwards
at
his
painting
.
Suddenly
her
*NL*
small
voice
wailed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
walk
about
,
Paul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
round
.
Her
eyes
,
like
dark
bubbles
in
her
face
,
were
looking
*NL*
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
,
''
he
said
gently
.
Another
fibre
seemed
to
snap
in
his
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
he
got
all
the
morphia
pills
there
were
,
and
took
them
*NL*
downstairs
.
Carefully
he
crushed
them
to
powder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
said
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
put
'em
in
her
night
milk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
both
laughed
together
like
two
conspiring
children
.
On
top
of
*NL*
all
their
horror
flicked
this
little
sanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nurse
did
not
come
that
night
to
settle
Mrs.
Morel
down
.
Paul
went
up
*NL*
with
the
hot
milk
in
a
feeding-cup
.
It
was
nine
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
reared
up
in
bed
,
and
he
put
the
feeding-cup
between
her
lips
*NL*
that
he
would
have
died
to
save
from
any
hurt
.
She
took
a
sip
,
then
put
*NL*
the
spout
of
the
cup
away
and
looked
at
him
with
her
dark
,
wondering
*NL*
eyes
.
He
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
IS
bitter
,
Paul
!
''
she
said
,
making
a
little
grimace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
new
sleeping
draught
the
doctor
gave
me
for
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
He
*NL*
thought
it
would
leave
you
in
such
a
state
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
hope
it
wo
n't
,
''
she
said
,
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
drank
some
more
of
the
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
IS
horrid
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
her
frail
fingers
over
the
cup
,
her
lips
making
a
little
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
--
I
tasted
it
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
I
'll
give
you
some
clean
milk
*NL*
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
,
''
she
said
,
and
she
went
on
with
the
draught
.
She
was
*NL*
obedient
to
him
like
a
child
.
He
wondered
if
she
knew
.
He
saw
her
*NL*
poor
wasted
throat
moving
as
she
drank
with
difficulty
.
Then
he
ran
*NL*
downstairs
for
more
milk
.
There
were
no
grains
in
the
bottom
of
the
cup
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
had
it
?
''
whispered
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
and
she
said
it
was
bitter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
laughed
Annie
,
putting
her
under
lip
between
her
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
told
her
it
was
a
new
draught
.
Where
's
that
milk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
why
nurse
did
n't
come
to
settle
me
down
?
''
complained
the
*NL*
mother
,
like
a
child
,
wistfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
said
she
was
going
to
a
concert
,
my
love
,
''
replied
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
a
minute
.
Mrs.
Morel
gulped
the
little
clean
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
,
that
draught
WAS
horrid
!
''
she
said
plaintively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
,
my
love
?
Well
,
never
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
sighed
again
with
weariness
.
Her
pulse
was
very
irregular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
US
settle
you
down
,
''
said
Annie
.
``
Perhaps
nurse
will
be
so
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
said
the
mother
--
``
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
the
clothes
back
.
Paul
saw
his
mother
like
a
girl
curled
up
*NL*
in
her
flannel
nightdress
.
Quickly
they
made
one
half
of
the
bed
,
moved
*NL*
her
,
made
the
other
,
straightened
her
nightgown
over
her
small
feet
,
and
*NL*
covered
her
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
Paul
,
stroking
her
softly
.
``
There
!
--
now
you
'll
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
did
n't
think
you
could
do
the
bed
so
nicely
,
''
she
*NL*
added
,
almost
gaily
.
Then
she
curled
up
,
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
,
her
*NL*
head
snugged
between
her
shoulders
.
Paul
put
the
long
thin
plait
of
grey
*NL*
hair
over
her
shoulder
and
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
sleep
,
my
love
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
trustfully
.
``
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
put
out
the
light
,
and
it
was
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
was
in
bed
.
Nurse
did
not
come
.
Annie
and
Paul
came
to
look
at
her
*NL*
at
about
eleven
.
She
seemed
to
be
sleeping
as
usual
after
her
draught
.
*NL*
Her
mouth
had
come
a
bit
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
sit
up
?
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'll
lie
with
her
as
I
always
do
,
''
said
Annie
.
``
She
might
wake
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
.
And
call
me
if
you
see
any
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
lingered
before
the
bedroom
fire
,
feeling
the
night
big
and
black
*NL*
and
snowy
outside
,
their
two
selves
alone
in
the
world
.
At
last
he
went
*NL*
into
the
next
room
and
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
slept
almost
immediately
,
but
kept
waking
every
now
and
again
.
Then
*NL*
he
went
sound
asleep
.
He
started
awake
at
Annie
's
whispered
,
``
Paul
,
*NL*
Paul
!
''
He
saw
his
sister
in
her
white
nightdress
,
with
her
long
plait
of
*NL*
hair
down
her
back
,
standing
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
''
he
whispered
,
sitting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
look
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
slipped
out
of
bed
.
A
bud
of
gas
was
burning
in
the
sick
chamber
.
*NL*
His
mother
lay
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
,
curled
up
as
she
had
gone
*NL*
to
sleep
.
But
her
mouth
had
fallen
open
,
and
she
breathed
with
great
,
*NL*
hoarse
breaths
,
like
snoring
,
and
there
were
long
intervals
between
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
going
!
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
has
she
been
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
just
woke
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Annie
huddled
into
the
dressing-gown
,
Paul
wrapped
himself
in
a
brown
*NL*
blanket
.
It
was
three
o'clock
.
He
mended
the
fire
.
Then
the
two
sat
*NL*
waiting
.
The
great
,
snoring
breath
was
taken
--
held
awhile
--
then
given
*NL*
back
.
There
was
a
space
--
a
long
space
.
Then
they
started
.
The
great
,
*NL*
snoring
breath
was
taken
again
.
He
bent
close
down
and
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
awful
!
''
whispered
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
.
They
sat
down
again
helplessly
.
Again
came
the
great
,
snoring
*NL*
breath
.
Again
they
hung
suspended
.
Again
it
was
given
back
,
long
and
*NL*
harsh
.
The
sound
,
so
irregular
,
at
such
wide
intervals
,
sounded
through
*NL*
the
house
.
Morel
,
in
his
room
,
slept
on
.
Paul
and
Annie
sat
crouched
,
*NL*
huddled
,
motionless
.
The
great
snoring
sound
began
again
--
there
was
a
*NL*
painful
pause
while
the
breath
was
held
--
back
came
the
rasping
breath
.
*NL*
Minute
after
minute
passed
.
Paul
looked
at
her
again
,
bending
low
over
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
may
last
like
this
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
silent
.
He
looked
out
of
the
window
,
and
could
faintly
*NL*
discern
the
snow
on
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
go
to
my
bed
,
''
he
said
to
Annie
.
``
I
'll
sit
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
'll
stop
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
you
did
n't
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Annie
crept
out
of
the
room
,
and
he
was
alone
.
He
hugged
himself
*NL*
in
his
brown
blanket
,
crouched
in
front
of
his
mother
,
watching
.
She
*NL*
looked
dreadful
,
with
the
bottom
jaw
fallen
back
.
He
watched
.
Sometimes
*NL*
he
thought
the
great
breath
would
never
begin
again
.
He
could
not
bear
*NL*
it
--
the
waiting
.
Then
suddenly
,
startling
him
,
came
the
great
harsh
*NL*
sound
.
He
mended
the
fire
again
,
noiselessly
.
She
must
not
be
disturbed
.
*NL*
The
minutes
went
by
.
The
night
was
going
,
breath
by
breath
.
Each
time
*NL*
the
sound
came
he
felt
it
wring
him
,
till
at
last
he
could
not
feel
so
*NL*
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
got
up
.
Paul
heard
the
miner
drawing
his
stockings
on
,
*NL*
yawning
.
Then
Morel
,
in
shirt
and
stockings
,
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
stood
watching
.
Then
he
looked
at
his
son
,
helplessly
,
and
in
*NL*
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
I
better
stop
a-whoam
?
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Go
to
work
.
She
'll
last
through
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Go
to
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
miner
looked
at
her
again
,
in
fear
,
and
went
obediently
out
of
the
*NL*
room
.
Paul
saw
the
tape
of
his
garters
swinging
against
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
another
half-hour
Paul
went
downstairs
and
drank
a
cup
of
tea
,
*NL*
then
returned
.
Morel
,
dressed
for
the
pit
,
came
upstairs
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
go
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
a
few
minutes
Paul
heard
his
father
's
heavy
steps
go
thudding
*NL*
over
the
deadening
snow
.
Miners
called
in
the
streets
as
they
*NL*
tramped
in
gangs
to
work
.
The
terrible
,
long-drawn
breaths
*NL*
continued
--
heave
--
heave
--
heave
;
then
a
long
pause
--
then
--
ah-h-h-h-h
!
*NL*
as
it
came
back
.
Far
away
over
the
snow
sounded
the
hooters
of
the
*NL*
ironworks
.
One
after
another
they
crowed
and
boomed
,
some
small
and
far
*NL*
away
,
some
near
,
the
blowers
of
the
collieries
and
the
other
works
.
*NL*
Then
there
was
silence
.
He
mended
the
fire
.
The
great
breaths
broke
the
*NL*
silence
--
she
looked
just
the
same
.
He
put
back
the
blind
and
peered
out
.
*NL*
Still
it
was
dark
.
Perhaps
there
was
a
lighter
tinge
.
Perhaps
the
snow
*NL*
was
bluer
.
He
drew
up
the
blind
and
got
dressed
.
Then
,
shuddering
,
he
*NL*
drank
brandy
from
the
bottle
on
the
wash-stand
.
The
snow
WAS
growing
*NL*
blue
.
He
heard
a
cart
clanking
down
the
street
.
Yes
,
it
was
seven
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
it
was
coming
a
little
bit
light
.
He
heard
some
people
*NL*
calling
.
The
world
was
waking
.
A
grey
,
deathly
dawn
crept
over
the
snow
.
*NL*
Yes
,
he
could
see
the
houses
.
He
put
out
the
gas
.
It
seemed
very
dark
.
*NL*
The
breathing
came
still
,
but
he
was
almost
used
to
it
.
He
could
see
*NL*
her
.
She
was
just
the
same
.
He
wondered
if
he
piled
heavy
clothes
on
top
*NL*
of
her
it
would
stop
.
He
looked
at
her
.
That
was
not
her
--
not
her
a
bit
.
*NL*
If
he
piled
the
blanket
and
heavy
coats
on
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
door
opened
,
and
Annie
entered
.
She
looked
at
him
*NL*
questioningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
the
same
,
''
he
said
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
whispered
together
a
minute
,
then
he
went
downstairs
to
get
*NL*
breakfast
.
It
was
twenty
to
eight
.
Soon
Annie
came
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
awful
!
Does
n't
she
look
awful
!
''
she
whispered
,
dazed
with
*NL*
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
looks
like
that
!
''
said
Annie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drink
some
tea
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
upstairs
again
.
Soon
the
neighbours
came
with
their
frightened
*NL*
question
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
went
on
just
the
same
.
She
lay
with
her
cheek
in
her
hand
,
her
mouth
*NL*
fallen
open
,
and
the
great
,
ghastly
snores
came
and
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
o'clock
nurse
came
.
She
looked
strange
and
woebegone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nurse
,
''
cried
Paul
,
``
she
'll
last
like
this
for
days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
ca
n't
,
Mr.
Morel
,
''
said
nurse
.
``
She
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
dreadful
!
''
wailed
the
nurse
.
``
Who
would
have
thought
she
could
*NL*
stand
it
?
Go
down
now
,
Mr.
Morel
,
go
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
at
about
eleven
o'clock
,
he
went
downstairs
and
sat
in
the
*NL*
neighbour
's
house
.
Annie
was
downstairs
also
.
Nurse
and
Arthur
were
*NL*
upstairs
.
Paul
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hand
.
Suddenly
Annie
came
flying
*NL*
across
the
yard
crying
,
half
mad
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paul
--
Paul
--
she
's
gone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
second
he
was
back
in
his
own
house
and
upstairs
.
She
lay
curled
*NL*
up
and
still
,
with
her
face
on
her
hand
,
and
nurse
was
wiping
her
mouth
.
*NL*
They
all
stood
back
.
He
kneeled
down
,
and
put
his
face
to
hers
and
his
*NL*
arms
round
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
love
--
my
love
--
oh
,
my
love
!
''
he
whispered
again
and
again
.
``
My
*NL*
love
--
oh
,
my
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
heard
the
nurse
behind
him
,
crying
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
better
,
Mr.
Morel
,
she
's
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
took
his
face
up
from
his
warm
,
dead
mother
he
went
straight
*NL*
downstairs
and
began
blacking
his
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
good
deal
to
do
,
letters
to
write
,
and
so
on
.
The
doctor
*NL*
came
and
glanced
at
her
,
and
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
--
poor
thing
!
''
he
said
,
then
turned
away
.
``
Well
,
call
at
the
surgery
*NL*
about
six
for
the
certificate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
came
home
from
work
at
about
four
o'clock
.
He
dragged
*NL*
silently
into
the
house
and
sat
down
.
Minnie
bustled
to
give
him
his
*NL*
dinner
.
Tired
,
he
laid
his
black
arms
on
the
table
.
There
were
swede
*NL*
turnips
for
his
dinner
,
which
he
liked
.
Paul
wondered
if
he
knew
.
It
was
*NL*
some
time
,
and
nobody
had
spoken
.
At
last
the
son
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
noticed
the
blinds
were
down
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
.
``
Why
--
has
she
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
wor
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
twelve
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
miner
sat
still
for
a
moment
,
then
began
his
dinner
.
It
was
as
*NL*
if
nothing
had
happened
.
He
ate
his
turnips
in
silence
.
Afterwards
he
*NL*
washed
and
went
upstairs
to
dress
.
The
door
of
her
room
was
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
her
?
''
Annie
asked
of
him
when
he
came
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
little
while
he
went
out
.
Annie
went
away
,
and
Paul
called
on
the
*NL*
undertaker
,
the
clergyman
,
the
doctor
,
the
registrar
.
It
was
a
long
*NL*
business
.
He
got
back
at
nearly
eight
o'clock
.
The
undertaker
was
coming
*NL*
soon
to
measure
for
the
coffin
.
The
house
was
empty
except
for
her
.
He
*NL*
took
a
candle
and
went
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
cold
,
that
had
been
warm
for
so
long
.
Flowers
,
bottles
,
*NL*
plates
,
all
sick-room
litter
was
taken
away
;
everything
was
harsh
and
*NL*
austere
.
She
lay
raised
on
the
bed
,
the
sweep
of
the
sheet
from
the
*NL*
raised
feet
was
like
a
clean
curve
of
snow
,
so
silent
.
She
lay
like
a
*NL*
maiden
asleep
.
With
his
candle
in
his
hand
,
he
bent
over
her
.
She
lay
*NL*
like
a
girl
asleep
and
dreaming
of
her
love
.
The
mouth
was
a
little
open
*NL*
as
if
wondering
from
the
suffering
,
but
her
face
was
young
,
her
brow
*NL*
clear
and
white
as
if
life
had
never
touched
it
.
He
looked
again
at
the
*NL*
eyebrows
,
at
the
small
,
winsome
nose
a
bit
on
one
side
.
She
was
young
*NL*
again
.
Only
the
hair
as
it
arched
so
beautifully
from
her
temples
was
*NL*
mixed
with
silver
,
and
the
two
simple
plaits
that
lay
on
her
shoulders
*NL*
were
filigree
of
silver
and
brown
.
She
would
wake
up
.
She
would
lift
her
*NL*
eyelids
.
She
was
with
him
still
.
He
bent
and
kissed
her
passionately
.
*NL*
But
there
was
coldness
against
his
mouth
.
He
bit
his
lips
with
horror
.
*NL*
Looking
at
her
,
he
felt
he
could
never
,
never
let
her
go
.
No
!
He
stroked
*NL*
the
hair
from
her
temples
.
That
,
too
,
was
cold
.
He
saw
the
mouth
so
dumb
*NL*
and
wondering
at
the
hurt
.
Then
he
crouched
on
the
floor
,
whispering
to
*NL*
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
with
her
when
the
undertakers
came
,
young
men
who
had
*NL*
been
to
school
with
him
.
They
touched
her
reverently
,
and
in
a
quiet
,
*NL*
businesslike
fashion
.
They
did
not
look
at
her
.
He
watched
jealously
.
He
*NL*
and
Annie
guarded
her
fiercely
.
They
would
not
let
anybody
come
to
see
*NL*
her
,
and
the
neighbours
were
offended
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
Paul
went
out
of
the
house
,
and
played
cards
at
a
*NL*
friend
's
.
It
was
midnight
when
he
got
back
.
His
father
rose
from
the
*NL*
couch
as
he
entered
,
saying
in
a
plaintive
way
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
tha
wor
niver
comin
'
,
lad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
think
you
'd
sit
up
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
father
looked
so
forlorn
.
Morel
had
been
a
man
without
fear
--
simply
*NL*
nothing
frightened
him
.
Paul
realised
with
a
start
that
he
had
been
*NL*
afraid
to
go
to
bed
,
alone
in
the
house
with
his
dead
.
He
was
sorry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgot
you
'd
be
alone
,
father
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
want
owt
to
eat
?
''
asked
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sithee
--
I
made
thee
a
drop
o
'
hot
milk
.
Get
it
down
thee
;
it
's
cold
*NL*
enough
for
owt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
drank
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
Morel
went
to
bed
.
He
hurried
past
the
closed
door
,
and
*NL*
left
his
own
door
open
.
Soon
the
son
came
upstairs
also
.
He
went
in
to
*NL*
kiss
her
good-night
,
as
usual
.
It
was
cold
and
dark
.
He
wished
they
had
*NL*
kept
her
fire
burning
.
Still
she
dreamed
her
young
dream
.
But
she
would
*NL*
be
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
!
''
he
whispered
.
``
My
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
did
not
kiss
her
,
for
fear
she
should
be
cold
and
strange
to
him
.
*NL*
It
eased
him
she
slept
so
beautifully
.
He
shut
her
door
softly
,
not
to
*NL*
wake
her
,
and
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Morel
summoned
his
courage
,
hearing
Annie
downstairs
and
*NL*
Paul
coughing
in
the
room
across
the
landing
.
He
opened
her
door
,
and
*NL*
went
into
the
darkened
room
.
He
saw
the
white
uplifted
form
in
the
*NL*
twilight
,
but
her
he
dared
not
see
.
Bewildered
,
too
frightened
to
*NL*
possess
any
of
his
faculties
,
he
got
out
of
the
room
again
and
left
her
.
*NL*
He
never
looked
at
her
again
.
He
had
not
seen
her
for
months
,
because
he
*NL*
had
not
dared
to
look
.
And
she
looked
like
his
young
wife
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
seen
her
?
''
Annie
asked
of
him
sharply
after
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
you
think
she
looks
nice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
of
the
house
soon
after
.
And
all
the
time
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
creeping
aside
to
avoid
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
about
from
place
to
place
,
doing
the
business
of
the
death
.
He
*NL*
met
Clara
in
Nottingham
,
and
they
had
tea
together
in
a
cafe
,
when
they
*NL*
were
quite
jolly
again
.
She
was
infinitely
relieved
to
find
he
did
not
*NL*
take
it
tragically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
,
when
the
relatives
began
to
come
for
the
funeral
,
the
affair
*NL*
became
public
,
and
the
children
became
social
beings
.
They
put
*NL*
themselves
aside
.
They
buried
her
in
a
furious
storm
of
rain
and
wind
.
*NL*
The
wet
clay
glistened
,
all
the
white
flowers
were
soaked
.
Annie
*NL*
gripped
his
arm
and
leaned
forward
.
Down
below
she
saw
a
dark
corner
*NL*
of
William
's
coffin
.
The
oak
box
sank
steadily
.
She
was
gone
.
The
*NL*
rain
poured
in
the
grave
.
The
procession
of
black
,
with
its
umbrellas
*NL*
glistening
,
turned
away
.
The
cemetery
was
deserted
under
the
drenching
*NL*
cold
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
went
home
and
busied
himself
supplying
the
guests
with
drinks
.
*NL*
His
father
sat
in
the
kitchen
with
Mrs.
Morel
's
relatives
,
``
superior
''
*NL*
people
,
and
wept
,
and
said
what
a
good
lass
she
'd
been
,
and
how
he
'd
*NL*
tried
to
do
everything
he
could
for
her
--
everything
.
He
had
striven
*NL*
all
his
life
to
do
what
he
could
for
her
,
and
he
'd
nothing
to
reproach
*NL*
himself
with
.
She
was
gone
,
but
he
'd
done
his
best
for
her
.
He
wiped
his
*NL*
eyes
with
his
white
handkerchief
.
He
'd
nothing
to
reproach
himself
for
,
*NL*
he
repeated
.
All
his
life
he
'd
done
his
best
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
was
how
he
tried
to
dismiss
her
.
He
never
thought
of
her
*NL*
personally
.
Everything
deep
in
him
he
denied
.
Paul
hated
his
father
*NL*
for
sitting
sentimentalising
over
her
.
He
knew
he
would
do
it
in
*NL*
the
public-houses
.
For
the
real
tragedy
went
on
in
Morel
in
spite
of
*NL*
himself
.
Sometimes
,
later
,
he
came
down
from
his
afternoon
sleep
,
white
*NL*
and
cowering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
HAVE
been
dreaming
of
thy
mother
,
''
he
said
in
a
small
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
,
father
?
When
I
dream
of
her
it
's
always
just
as
she
was
when
*NL*
she
was
well
.
I
dream
of
her
often
,
but
it
seems
quite
nice
and
natural
,
*NL*
as
if
nothing
had
altered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Morel
crouched
in
front
of
the
fire
in
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
weeks
passed
half-real
,
not
much
pain
,
not
much
of
anything
,
perhaps
*NL*
a
little
relief
,
mostly
a
_
nuit
blanche
_
.
Paul
went
restless
from
place
*NL*
to
place
.
For
some
months
,
since
his
mother
had
been
worse
,
he
had
not
*NL*
made
love
to
Clara
.
She
was
,
as
it
were
,
dumb
to
him
,
rather
distant
.
*NL*
Dawes
saw
her
very
occasionally
,
but
the
two
could
not
get
an
inch
*NL*
across
the
great
distance
between
them
.
The
three
of
them
were
drifting
*NL*
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
mended
very
slowly
.
He
was
in
the
convalescent
home
at
Skegness
at
*NL*
Christmas
,
nearly
well
again
.
Paul
went
to
the
seaside
for
a
few
days
.
*NL*
His
father
was
with
Annie
in
Sheffield
.
Dawes
came
to
Paul
's
lodgings
.
*NL*
His
time
in
the
home
was
up
.
The
two
men
,
between
whom
was
such
a
big
*NL*
reserve
,
seemed
faithful
to
each
other
.
Dawes
depended
on
Morel
now
.
He
*NL*
knew
Paul
and
Clara
had
practically
separated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
after
Christmas
Paul
was
to
go
back
to
Nottingham
.
The
evening
*NL*
before
he
sat
with
Dawes
smoking
before
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
Clara
's
coming
down
for
the
day
to-morrow
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
man
glanced
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
told
me
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
drank
the
remainder
of
his
glass
of
whisky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
the
landlady
your
wife
was
coming
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
?
''
said
Dawes
,
shrinking
,
but
almost
leaving
himself
in
the
*NL*
other
's
hands
.
He
got
up
rather
stiffly
,
and
reached
for
Morel
's
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
fill
you
up
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
jumped
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sit
still
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dawes
,
with
rather
shaky
hand
,
continued
to
mix
the
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
when
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
!
''
replied
the
other
.
``
But
you
've
no
business
to
get
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
me
good
,
lad
,
''
replied
Dawes
.
``
I
begin
to
think
I
'm
right
*NL*
again
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
about
right
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
certainly
I
am
,
''
said
Dawes
,
nodding
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Len
says
he
can
get
you
on
in
Sheffield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
glanced
at
him
again
,
with
dark
eyes
that
agreed
with
everything
*NL*
the
other
would
say
,
perhaps
a
trifle
dominated
by
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
funny
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
starting
again
.
I
feel
in
a
lot
bigger
mess
*NL*
than
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
,
lad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
do
n't
know
.
It
's
as
if
I
was
in
a
tangled
sort
of
hole
,
*NL*
rather
dark
and
dreary
,
and
no
road
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
--
I
understand
it
,
''
Dawes
said
,
nodding
.
``
But
you
'll
find
it
'll
*NL*
come
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
caressingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
knocked
his
pipe
in
a
hopeless
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
not
done
for
yourself
like
I
have
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
saw
the
wrist
and
the
white
hand
of
the
other
man
gripping
the
*NL*
stem
of
the
pipe
and
knocking
out
the
ash
,
as
if
he
had
given
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
are
you
?
''
Paul
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirty-nine
,
''
replied
Dawes
,
glancing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
brown
eyes
,
full
of
the
consciousness
of
failure
,
almost
pleading
*NL*
for
reassurance
,
for
someone
to
re-establish
the
man
in
himself
,
to
warm
*NL*
him
,
to
set
him
up
firm
again
,
troubled
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
just
be
in
your
prime
,
''
said
Morel
.
``
You
do
n't
look
as
if
much
*NL*
life
had
gone
out
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
brown
eyes
of
the
other
flashed
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
n't
,
''
he
said
.
``
The
go
is
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
looked
up
and
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
both
got
plenty
of
life
in
us
yet
to
make
things
fly
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
.
They
exchanged
one
look
.
Having
recognised
*NL*
the
stress
of
passion
each
in
the
other
,
they
both
drank
their
whisky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
begod
!
''
said
Dawes
,
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
do
n't
see
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
why
you
should
n't
go
on
where
you
left
*NL*
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
--
''
said
Dawes
,
suggestively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
fit
your
old
home
together
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
hid
his
face
and
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
be
done
,
''
he
said
,
and
looked
up
with
an
ironic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
Because
you
do
n't
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
smoked
in
silence
.
Dawes
showed
his
teeth
as
he
bit
his
pipe
stem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
you
do
n't
want
her
?
''
asked
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
stared
up
at
the
picture
with
a
caustic
expression
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
know
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smoke
floated
softly
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
she
wants
you
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
''
replied
the
other
,
soft
,
satirical
,
abstract
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
never
really
hitched
on
to
me
--
you
were
always
there
in
the
*NL*
background
.
That
's
why
she
would
n't
get
a
divorce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
continued
to
stare
in
a
satirical
fashion
at
the
picture
over
the
*NL*
mantelpiece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
how
women
are
with
me
,
''
said
Paul
.
``
They
want
me
like
mad
,
but
*NL*
they
do
n't
want
to
belong
to
me
.
And
she
BELONGED
to
you
all
the
time
.
I
*NL*
knew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
triumphant
male
came
up
in
Dawes
.
He
showed
his
teeth
more
*NL*
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
was
a
fool
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
a
big
fool
,
''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
perhaps
even
THEN
you
were
a
bigger
fool
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
touch
of
triumph
and
malice
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
I
'm
clearing
out
to-morrow
,
''
said
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
answered
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
did
not
talk
any
more
.
The
instinct
to
murder
each
other
had
*NL*
returned
.
They
almost
avoided
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
shared
the
same
bedroom
.
When
they
retired
Dawes
seemed
abstract
,
*NL*
thinking
of
something
.
He
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
in
his
shirt
,
*NL*
looking
at
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
getting
cold
?
''
asked
Morel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
lookin
'
at
these
legs
,
''
replied
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
up
with
'em
?
They
look
all
right
,
''
replied
Paul
,
from
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
look
all
right
.
But
there
's
some
water
in
'em
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
reluctantly
got
out
of
bed
and
went
to
look
at
the
rather
handsome
*NL*
legs
of
the
other
man
that
were
covered
with
glistening
,
dark
gold
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
''
said
Dawes
,
pointing
to
his
shin
.
``
Look
at
the
water
under
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
pressed
in
his
finger-tips
.
They
left
little
dents
that
filled
*NL*
up
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nothing
,
''
said
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
feel
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
tried
with
his
fingers
.
It
made
little
dents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rotten
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
It
's
nothing
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
much
of
a
man
with
water
in
your
legs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
see
as
it
makes
any
difference
,
''
said
Morel
.
``
I
've
got
a
weak
*NL*
chest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
his
own
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
the
rest
of
me
's
all
right
,
''
said
Dawes
,
and
he
put
out
the
*NL*
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
it
was
raining
.
Morel
packed
his
bag
.
The
sea
was
grey
*NL*
and
shaggy
and
dismal
.
He
seemed
to
be
cutting
himself
off
from
life
*NL*
more
and
more
.
It
gave
him
a
wicked
pleasure
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
were
at
the
station
.
Clara
stepped
out
of
the
train
,
and
*NL*
came
along
the
platform
,
very
erect
and
coldly
composed
.
She
wore
a
long
*NL*
coat
and
a
tweed
hat
.
Both
men
hated
her
for
her
composure
.
Paul
shook
*NL*
hands
with
her
at
the
barrier
.
Dawes
was
leaning
against
the
bookstall
,
*NL*
watching
.
His
black
overcoat
was
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
because
of
the
*NL*
rain
.
He
was
pale
,
with
almost
a
touch
of
nobility
in
his
quietness
.
He
*NL*
came
forward
,
limping
slightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
look
better
than
this
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
all
right
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
stood
at
a
loss
.
She
kept
the
two
men
hesitating
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
to
the
lodging
straight
off
,
''
said
Paul
,
``
or
somewhere
*NL*
else
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
may
as
well
go
home
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
walked
on
the
outside
of
the
pavement
,
then
Dawes
,
then
Clara
.
They
*NL*
made
polite
conversation
.
The
sitting-room
faced
the
sea
,
whose
tide
,
*NL*
grey
and
shaggy
,
hissed
not
far
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
swung
up
the
big
arm-chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
Jack
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
that
chair
,
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
!
''
Morel
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Clara
took
off
her
things
and
laid
them
on
the
couch
.
She
had
a
slight
*NL*
air
of
resentment
.
Lifting
her
hair
with
her
fingers
,
she
sat
down
,
*NL*
rather
aloof
and
composed
.
Paul
ran
downstairs
to
speak
to
the
landlady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
you
're
cold
,
''
said
Dawes
to
his
wife
.
``
Come
nearer
to
*NL*
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
I
'm
quite
warm
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
rain
and
at
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
are
you
going
back
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
rooms
are
taken
until
to-morrow
,
so
he
wants
me
to
stop
.
He
's
*NL*
going
back
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
you
're
thinking
of
going
to
Sheffield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
fit
to
start
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
start
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
really
got
a
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
begin
on
Monday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
look
fit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
again
out
of
the
window
instead
of
answering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
got
lodgings
in
Sheffield
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
she
looked
away
out
of
the
window
.
The
panes
were
blurred
with
*NL*
streaming
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
can
you
manage
all
right
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
s
'd
think
so
.
I
s
'll
have
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
when
Morel
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
go
by
the
four-twenty
,
''
he
said
as
he
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
'd
take
your
boots
off
,
''
he
said
to
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
pair
of
slippers
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
she
said
.
``
They
are
n't
wet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
the
slippers
near
her
feet
.
She
left
them
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morel
sat
down
.
Both
the
men
seemed
helpless
,
and
each
of
them
had
a
*NL*
rather
hunted
look
.
But
Dawes
now
carried
himself
quietly
,
seemed
to
*NL*
yield
himself
,
while
Paul
seemed
to
screw
himself
up
.
Clara
thought
she
*NL*
had
never
seen
him
look
so
small
and
mean
.
He
was
as
if
trying
to
*NL*
get
himself
into
the
smallest
possible
compass
.
And
as
he
went
about
*NL*
arranging
,
and
as
he
sat
talking
,
there
seemed
something
false
about
him
*NL*
and
out
of
tune
.
Watching
him
unknown
,
she
said
to
herself
there
was
*NL*
no
stability
about
him
.
He
was
fine
in
his
way
,
passionate
,
and
able
to
*NL*
give
her
drinks
of
pure
life
when
he
was
in
one
mood
.
And
now
he
looked
*NL*
paltry
and
insignificant
.
There
was
nothing
stable
about
him
.
Her
*NL*
husband
had
more
manly
dignity
.
At
any
rate
HE
did
not
waft
about
with
*NL*
any
wind
.
There
was
something
evanescent
about
Morel
,
she
thought
,
*NL*
something
shifting
and
false
.
He
would
never
make
sure
ground
for
any
*NL*
woman
to
stand
on
.
She
despised
him
rather
for
his
shrinking
together
,
*NL*
getting
smaller
.
Her
husband
at
least
was
manly
,
and
when
he
was
beaten
*NL*
gave
in
.
But
this
other
would
never
own
to
being
beaten
.
He
would
shift
*NL*
round
and
round
,
prowl
,
get
smaller
.
She
despised
him
.
And
yet
she
*NL*
watched
him
rather
than
Dawes
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
their
three
fates
lay
*NL*
in
his
hands
.
She
hated
him
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
understand
better
now
about
men
,
and
what
they
could
or
*NL*
would
do
.
She
was
less
afraid
of
them
,
more
sure
of
herself
.
That
*NL*
they
were
not
the
small
egoists
she
had
imagined
them
made
her
more
*NL*
comfortable
.
She
had
learned
a
good
deal
--
almost
as
much
as
she
wanted
*NL*
to
learn
.
Her
cup
had
been
full
.
It
was
still
as
full
as
she
could
*NL*
carry
.
On
the
whole
,
she
would
not
be
sorry
when
he
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
dinner
,
and
sat
eating
nuts
and
drinking
by
the
fire
.
Not
*NL*
a
serious
word
had
been
spoken
.
Yet
Clara
realised
that
Morel
was
*NL*
withdrawing
from
the
circle
,
leaving
her
the
option
to
stay
with
her
*NL*
husband
.
It
angered
her
.
He
was
a
mean
fellow
,
after
all
,
to
take
what
*NL*
he
wanted
and
then
give
her
back
.
She
did
not
remember
that
she
herself
*NL*
had
had
what
she
wanted
,
and
really
,
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
,
wished
*NL*
to
be
given
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paul
felt
crumpled
up
and
lonely
.
His
mother
had
really
supported
his
*NL*
life
.
He
had
loved
her
;
they
two
had
,
in
fact
,
faced
the
world
together
.
*NL*
Now
she
was
gone
,
and
for
ever
behind
him
was
the
gap
in
life
,
the
tear
*NL*
in
the
veil
,
through
which
his
life
seemed
to
drift
slowly
,
as
if
he
*NL*
were
drawn
towards
death
.
He
wanted
someone
of
their
own
free
initiative
*NL*
to
help
him
.
The
lesser
things
he
began
to
let
go
from
him
,
for
fear
of
*NL*
this
big
thing
,
the
lapse
towards
death
,
following
in
the
wake
of
his
*NL*
beloved
.
Clara
could
not
stand
for
him
to
hold
on
to
.
She
wanted
him
,
*NL*
but
not
to
understand
him
.
He
felt
she
wanted
the
man
on
top
,
not
the
*NL*
real
him
that
was
in
trouble
.
That
would
be
too
much
trouble
to
her
;
he
*NL*
dared
not
give
it
her
.
She
could
not
cope
with
him
.
It
made
him
ashamed
.
*NL*
So
,
secretly
ashamed
because
he
was
in
such
a
mess
,
because
his
own
hold
*NL*
on
life
was
so
unsure
,
because
nobody
held
him
,
feeling
unsubstantial
,
*NL*
shadowy
,
as
if
he
did
not
count
for
much
in
this
concrete
world
,
he
drew
*NL*
himself
together
smaller
and
smaller
.
He
did
not
want
to
die
;
he
would
*NL*
not
give
in
.
But
he
was
not
afraid
of
death
.
If
nobody
would
help
,
he
*NL*
would
go
on
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
had
been
driven
to
the
extremity
of
life
,
until
he
was
afraid
.
He
*NL*
could
go
to
the
brink
of
death
,
he
could
lie
on
the
edge
and
look
in
.
*NL*
Then
,
cowed
,
afraid
,
he
had
to
crawl
back
,
and
like
a
beggar
take
what
*NL*
offered
.
There
was
a
certain
nobility
in
it
.
As
Clara
saw
,
he
owned
*NL*
himself
beaten
,
and
he
wanted
to
be
taken
back
whether
or
not
.
That
she
*NL*
could
do
for
him
.
It
was
three
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
by
the
four-twenty
,
''
said
Paul
again
to
Clara
.
``
Are
you
*NL*
coming
then
or
later
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
meeting
my
father
in
Nottingham
at
seven-fifteen
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
she
answered
,
``
I
'll
come
later
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawes
jerked
suddenly
,
as
if
he
had
been
held
on
a
strain
.
He
looked
out
*NL*
over
the
sea
,
but
he
saw
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
one
or
two
books
in
the
corner
,
''
said
Morel
.
``
I
've
done
with
*NL*
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
four
o'clock
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
see
you
both
later
,
''
he
said
,
as
he
shook
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
,
''
said
Dawes
.
``
An
'
perhaps
--
one
day
--
I
s
'll
be
able
to
pay
*NL*
you
back
the
money
as
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
for
it
,
you
'll
see
,
''
laughed
Paul
.
``
I
s
'll
be
on
the
rocks
*NL*
before
I
'm
very
much
older
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
--
well
--
''
said
Dawes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
he
said
to
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
she
said
,
giving
him
her
hand
.
Then
she
glanced
at
him
for
*NL*
the
last
time
,
dumb
and
humble
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
gone
.
Dawes
and
his
wife
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
nasty
day
for
travelling
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
in
a
desultory
fashion
until
it
grew
dark
.
The
landlady
*NL*
brought
in
the
tea
.
Dawes
drew
up
his
chair
to
the
table
without
being
*NL*
invited
,
like
a
husband
.
Then
he
sat
humbly
waiting
for
his
cup
.
She
*NL*
served
him
as
she
would
,
like
a
wife
,
not
consulting
his
wish
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
tea
,
as
it
drew
near
to
six
o'clock
,
he
went
to
the
window
.
All
*NL*
was
dark
outside
.
The
sea
was
roaring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
raining
yet
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
?
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
go
to-night
,
shall
you
?
''
he
said
,
hesitating
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
answer
.
He
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
go
in
this
rain
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
WANT
me
to
stay
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
as
he
held
the
dark
curtain
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
with
his
back
to
her
.
She
rose
and
went
slowly
to
him
.
He
*NL*
let
go
the
curtain
,
turned
,
hesitating
,
towards
her
.
She
stood
with
*NL*
her
hands
behind
her
back
,
looking
up
at
him
in
a
heavy
,
inscrutable
*NL*
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
me
,
Baxter
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
was
hoarse
as
he
answered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
come
back
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
a
moaning
noise
,
lifted
her
arms
,
and
put
them
round
his
*NL*
neck
,
drawing
him
to
her
.
He
hid
his
face
on
her
shoulder
,
holding
her
*NL*
clasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
me
back
!
''
she
whispered
,
ecstatic
.
``
Take
me
back
,
take
me
back
!
''
*NL*
And
she
put
her
fingers
through
his
fine
,
thin
dark
hair
,
as
if
she
were
*NL*
only
semi-conscious
.
He
tightened
his
grasp
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
me
again
?
''
he
murmured
,
broken
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
DERELICT
*NL*
*NL*
CLARA
went
with
her
husband
to
Sheffield
,
and
Paul
scarcely
saw
her
*NL*
again
.
Walter
Morel
seemed
to
have
let
all
the
trouble
go
over
him
,
and
*NL*
there
he
was
,
crawling
about
on
the
mud
of
it
,
just
the
same
.
There
was
*NL*
scarcely
any
bond
between
father
and
son
,
save
that
each
felt
he
must
*NL*
not
let
the
other
go
in
any
actual
want
.
As
there
was
no
one
to
keep
on
*NL*
the
home
,
and
as
they
could
neither
of
them
bear
the
emptiness
of
the
*NL*
house
,
Paul
took
lodgings
in
Nottingham
,
and
Morel
went
to
live
with
a
*NL*
friendly
family
in
Bestwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
seemed
to
have
gone
smash
for
the
young
man
.
He
could
not
*NL*
paint
.
The
picture
he
finished
on
the
day
of
his
mother
's
death
--
one
*NL*
that
satisfied
him
--
was
the
last
thing
he
did
.
At
work
there
was
no
*NL*
Clara
.
When
he
came
home
he
could
not
take
up
his
brushes
again
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
was
always
in
the
town
at
one
place
or
another
,
drinking
,
*NL*
knocking
about
with
the
men
he
knew
.
It
really
wearied
him
.
He
talked
to
*NL*
barmaids
,
to
almost
any
woman
,
but
there
was
that
dark
,
strained
look
in
*NL*
his
eyes
,
as
if
he
were
hunting
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
seemed
so
different
,
so
unreal
.
There
seemed
no
reason
why
*NL*
people
should
go
along
the
street
,
and
houses
pile
up
in
the
daylight
.
*NL*
There
seemed
no
reason
why
these
things
should
occupy
the
space
,
instead
*NL*
of
leaving
it
empty
.
His
friends
talked
to
him
:
he
heard
the
sounds
,
and
*NL*
he
answered
.
But
why
there
should
be
the
noise
of
speech
he
could
not
*NL*
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
most
himself
when
he
was
alone
,
or
working
hard
and
mechanically
*NL*
at
the
factory
.
In
the
latter
case
there
was
pure
forgetfulness
,
when
he
*NL*
lapsed
from
consciousness
.
But
it
had
to
come
to
an
end
.
It
hurt
him
so
,
*NL*
that
things
had
lost
their
reality
.
The
first
snowdrops
came
.
He
saw
the
*NL*
tiny
drop-pearls
among
the
grey
.
They
would
have
given
him
the
liveliest
*NL*
emotion
at
one
time
.
Now
they
were
there
,
but
they
did
not
seem
to
mean
*NL*
anything
.
In
a
few
moments
they
would
cease
to
occupy
that
place
,
and
*NL*
just
the
space
would
be
,
where
they
had
been
.
Tall
,
brilliant
tram-cars
*NL*
ran
along
the
street
at
night
.
It
seemed
almost
a
wonder
they
should
*NL*
trouble
to
rustle
backwards
and
forwards
.
``
Why
trouble
to
go
tilting
*NL*
down
to
Trent
Bridges
?
''
he
asked
of
the
big
trams
.
It
seemed
they
just
*NL*
as
well
might
NOT
be
as
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
realest
thing
was
the
thick
darkness
at
night
.
That
seemed
to
him
*NL*
whole
and
comprehensible
and
restful
.
He
could
leave
himself
to
it
.
*NL*
Suddenly
a
piece
of
paper
started
near
his
feet
and
blew
along
down
the
*NL*
pavement
.
He
stood
still
,
rigid
,
with
clenched
fists
,
a
flame
of
agony
*NL*
going
over
him
.
And
he
saw
again
the
sick-room
,
his
mother
,
her
eyes
.
*NL*
Unconsciously
he
had
been
with
her
,
in
her
company
.
The
swift
hop
of
*NL*
the
paper
reminded
him
she
was
gone
.
But
he
had
been
with
her
.
He
wanted
*NL*
everything
to
stand
still
,
so
that
he
could
be
with
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
days
passed
,
the
weeks
.
But
everything
seemed
to
have
fused
,
gone
*NL*
into
a
conglomerated
mass
.
He
could
not
tell
one
day
from
another
,
one
*NL*
week
from
another
,
hardly
one
place
from
another
.
Nothing
was
distinct
*NL*
or
distinguishable
.
Often
he
lost
himself
for
an
hour
at
a
time
,
could
*NL*
not
remember
what
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
he
came
home
late
to
his
lodging
.
The
fire
was
burning
low
;
*NL*
everybody
was
in
bed
.
He
threw
on
some
more
coal
,
glanced
at
the
table
,
*NL*
and
decided
he
wanted
no
supper
.
Then
he
sat
down
in
the
arm-chair
.
It
*NL*
was
perfectly
still
.
He
did
not
know
anything
,
yet
he
saw
the
dim
*NL*
smoke
wavering
up
the
chimney
.
Presently
two
mice
came
out
,
cautiously
,
*NL*
nibbling
the
fallen
crumbs
.
He
watched
them
as
it
were
from
a
long
*NL*
way
off
.
The
church
clock
struck
two
.
Far
away
he
could
hear
the
sharp
*NL*
clinking
of
the
trucks
on
the
railway
.
No
,
it
was
not
they
that
were
far
*NL*
away
.
They
were
there
in
their
places
.
But
where
was
he
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
passed
.
The
two
mice
,
careering
wildly
,
scampered
cheekily
over
*NL*
his
slippers
.
He
had
not
moved
a
muscle
.
He
did
not
want
to
move
.
He
*NL*
was
not
thinking
of
anything
.
It
was
easier
so
.
There
was
no
wrench
of
*NL*
knowing
anything
.
Then
,
from
time
to
time
,
some
other
consciousness
,
*NL*
working
mechanically
,
flashed
into
sharp
phrases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
out
of
the
semi-intoxicated
trance
came
the
answer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Destroying
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
dull
,
live
feeling
,
gone
in
an
instant
,
told
him
that
it
was
*NL*
wrong
.
After
a
while
,
suddenly
came
the
question
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
there
was
no
answer
,
but
a
stroke
of
hot
stubbornness
inside
his
*NL*
chest
resisted
his
own
annihilation
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sound
of
a
heavy
cart
clanking
down
the
road
.
Suddenly
*NL*
the
electric
light
went
out
;
there
was
a
bruising
thud
in
the
*NL*
penny-in-the-slot
meter
.
He
did
not
stir
,
but
sat
gazing
in
front
of
*NL*
him
.
Only
the
mice
had
scuttled
,
and
the
fire
glowed
red
in
the
dark
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
quite
mechanically
and
more
distinctly
,
the
conversation
began
*NL*
again
inside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
dead
.
What
was
it
all
for
--
her
struggle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
his
despair
wanting
to
go
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
--
in
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
he
felt
tired
with
the
burden
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
to
keep
alive
for
her
sake
,
''
said
his
will
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
felt
sulky
,
as
if
it
would
not
rouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
to
carry
forward
her
living
,
and
what
she
had
done
,
go
on
*NL*
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
not
want
to
.
He
wanted
to
give
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
can
go
on
with
your
painting
,
''
said
the
will
in
him
.
``
Or
else
*NL*
you
can
beget
children
.
They
both
carry
on
her
effort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Painting
is
not
living
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
whom
?
''
came
the
sulky
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
best
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miriam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
not
trust
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
suddenly
,
went
straight
to
bed
.
When
he
got
inside
his
bedroom
*NL*
and
closed
the
door
,
he
stood
with
clenched
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mater
,
my
dear
--
''
he
began
,
with
the
whole
force
of
his
soul
.
Then
he
*NL*
stopped
.
He
would
not
say
it
.
He
would
not
admit
that
he
wanted
to
die
,
*NL*
to
have
done
.
He
would
not
own
that
life
had
beaten
him
,
or
that
death
*NL*
had
beaten
him
.
Going
straight
to
bed
,
he
slept
at
once
,
abandoning
*NL*
himself
to
the
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
weeks
went
on
.
Always
alone
,
his
soul
oscillated
,
first
on
the
*NL*
side
of
death
,
then
on
the
side
of
life
,
doggedly
.
The
real
agony
*NL*
was
that
he
had
nowhere
to
go
,
nothing
to
do
,
nothing
to
say
,
and
WAS
*NL*
nothing
himself
.
Sometimes
he
ran
down
the
streets
as
if
he
were
mad
:
*NL*
sometimes
he
was
mad
;
things
were
n't
there
,
things
were
there
.
It
made
*NL*
him
pant
.
Sometimes
he
stood
before
the
bar
of
the
public-house
where
he
*NL*
called
for
a
drink
.
Everything
suddenly
stood
back
away
from
him
.
He
*NL*
saw
the
face
of
the
barmaid
,
the
gobbling
drinkers
,
his
own
glass
on
the
*NL*
slopped
,
mahogany
board
,
in
the
distance
.
There
was
something
between
*NL*
him
and
them
.
He
could
not
get
into
touch
.
He
did
not
want
them
;
he
did
*NL*
not
want
his
drink
.
Turning
abruptly
,
he
went
out
.
On
the
threshold
he
*NL*
stood
and
looked
at
the
lighted
street
.
But
he
was
not
of
it
or
in
it
.
*NL*
Something
separated
him
.
Everything
went
on
there
below
those
lamps
,
*NL*
shut
away
from
him
.
He
could
not
get
at
them
.
He
felt
he
could
n't
touch
*NL*
the
lamp-posts
,
not
if
he
reached
.
Where
could
he
go
?
There
was
nowhere
*NL*
to
go
,
neither
back
into
the
inn
,
or
forward
anywhere
.
He
felt
stifled
.
*NL*
There
was
nowhere
for
him
.
The
stress
grew
inside
him
;
he
felt
he
should
*NL*
smash
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
n't
,
''
he
said
;
and
,
turning
blindly
,
he
went
in
and
drank
.
*NL*
Sometimes
the
drink
did
him
good
;
sometimes
it
made
him
worse
.
He
ran
*NL*
down
the
road
.
For
ever
restless
,
he
went
here
,
there
,
everywhere
.
He
*NL*
determined
to
work
.
But
when
he
had
made
six
strokes
,
he
loathed
the
*NL*
pencil
violently
,
got
up
,
and
went
away
,
hurried
off
to
a
club
where
he
*NL*
could
play
cards
or
billiards
,
to
a
place
where
he
could
flirt
with
a
*NL*
barmaid
who
was
no
more
to
him
than
the
brass
pump-handle
she
drew
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
thin
and
lantern-jawed
.
He
dared
not
meet
his
own
eyes
*NL*
in
the
mirror
;
he
never
looked
at
himself
.
He
wanted
to
get
away
from
*NL*
himself
,
but
there
was
nothing
to
get
hold
of
.
In
despair
he
thought
of
*NL*
Miriam
.
Perhaps
--
perhaps
--
?
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
happening
to
go
into
the
Unitarian
Church
one
Sunday
evening
,
when
*NL*
they
stood
up
to
sing
the
second
hymn
he
saw
her
before
him
.
The
light
*NL*
glistened
on
her
lower
lip
as
she
sang
.
She
looked
as
if
she
had
got
*NL*
something
,
at
any
rate
:
some
hope
in
heaven
,
if
not
in
earth
.
Her
*NL*
comfort
and
her
life
seemed
in
the
after-world
.
A
warm
,
strong
feeling
*NL*
for
her
came
up
.
She
seemed
to
yearn
,
as
she
sang
,
for
the
mystery
and
*NL*
comfort
.
He
put
his
hope
in
her
.
He
longed
for
the
sermon
to
be
over
,
to
*NL*
speak
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
throng
carried
her
out
just
before
him
.
He
could
nearly
touch
her
.
*NL*
She
did
not
know
he
was
there
.
He
saw
the
brown
,
humble
nape
of
her
neck
*NL*
under
its
black
curls
.
He
would
leave
himself
to
her
.
She
was
better
and
*NL*
bigger
than
he
.
He
would
depend
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
wandering
,
in
her
blind
way
,
through
the
little
throngs
of
*NL*
people
outside
the
church
.
She
always
looked
so
lost
and
out
of
place
*NL*
among
people
.
He
went
forward
and
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
.
She
started
*NL*
violently
.
Her
great
brown
eyes
dilated
in
fear
,
then
went
questioning
*NL*
at
the
sight
of
him
.
He
shrank
slightly
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
--
''
she
faltered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
away
.
His
sudden
,
flaring
hope
sank
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
in
town
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
staying
at
Cousin
Anne
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
For
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
only
till
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
you
go
straight
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
then
hid
her
face
under
her
hat-brim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
--
``
no
;
it
's
not
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
,
and
she
went
with
him
.
They
threaded
through
the
throng
*NL*
of
church
people
.
The
organ
was
still
sounding
in
St.
Mary
's
.
Dark
*NL*
figures
came
through
the
lighted
doors
;
people
were
coming
down
the
*NL*
steps
.
The
large
coloured
windows
glowed
up
in
the
night
.
The
church
was
*NL*
like
a
great
lantern
suspended
.
They
went
down
Hollow
Stone
,
and
he
took
*NL*
the
car
for
the
Bridges
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
just
have
supper
with
me
,
''
he
said
:
``
then
I
'll
bring
you
*NL*
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
she
replied
,
low
and
husky
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
scarcely
spoke
while
they
were
on
the
car
.
The
Trent
ran
dark
and
*NL*
full
under
the
bridge
.
Away
towards
Colwick
all
was
black
night
.
He
*NL*
lived
down
Holme
Road
,
on
the
naked
edge
of
the
town
,
facing
across
the
*NL*
river
meadows
towards
Sneinton
Hermitage
and
the
steep
scrap
of
Colwick
*NL*
Wood
.
The
floods
were
out
.
The
silent
water
and
the
darkness
spread
away
*NL*
on
their
left
.
Almost
afraid
,
they
hurried
along
by
the
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Supper
was
laid
.
He
swung
the
curtain
over
the
window
.
There
was
a
bowl
*NL*
of
freesias
and
scarlet
anemones
on
the
table
.
She
bent
to
them
.
Still
*NL*
touching
them
with
her
finger-tips
,
she
looked
up
at
him
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
they
beautiful
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
.
``
What
will
you
drink
--
coffee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
it
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
excuse
me
a
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
to
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miriam
took
off
her
things
and
looked
round
.
It
was
a
bare
,
severe
*NL*
room
.
Her
photo
,
Clara
's
,
Annie
's
,
were
on
the
wall
.
She
looked
on
*NL*
the
drawing-board
to
see
what
he
was
doing
.
There
were
only
a
few
*NL*
meaningless
lines
.
She
looked
to
see
what
books
he
was
reading
.
*NL*
Evidently
just
an
ordinary
novel
.
The
letters
in
the
rack
she
saw
*NL*
were
from
Annie
,
Arthur
,
and
from
some
man
or
other
she
did
not
know
.
*NL*
Everything
he
had
touched
,
everything
that
was
in
the
least
personal
to
*NL*
him
,
she
examined
with
lingering
absorption
.
He
had
been
gone
from
her
*NL*
for
so
long
,
she
wanted
to
rediscover
him
,
his
position
,
what
he
was
*NL*
now
.
But
there
was
not
much
in
the
room
to
help
her
.
It
only
made
her
*NL*
feel
rather
sad
,
it
was
so
hard
and
comfortless
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
curiously
examining
a
sketch-book
when
he
returned
with
the
*NL*
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
new
in
it
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
nothing
very
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
down
the
tray
,
and
went
to
look
over
her
shoulder
.
She
turned
the
*NL*
pages
slowly
,
intent
on
examining
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
!
''
he
said
,
as
she
paused
at
a
sketch
.
``
I
'd
forgotten
that
.
It
's
not
*NL*
bad
,
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
do
n't
quite
understand
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
book
from
her
and
went
through
it
.
Again
he
made
a
curious
*NL*
sound
of
surprise
and
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
some
not
bad
stuff
in
there
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
bad
,
''
she
answered
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
again
her
interest
in
his
work
.
Or
was
it
for
himself
?
Why
was
*NL*
she
always
most
interested
in
him
as
he
appeared
in
his
work
?
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
down
to
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
''
he
said
,
``
did
n't
I
hear
something
about
your
earning
your
*NL*
own
living
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
replied
,
bowing
her
dark
head
over
her
cup
.
``
And
what
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
merely
going
to
the
farming
college
at
Broughton
for
three
months
,
*NL*
and
I
shall
probably
be
kept
on
as
a
teacher
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
--
that
sounds
all
right
for
you
!
You
always
wanted
to
be
*NL*
independent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
knew
last
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
heard
a
month
ago
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
nothing
was
settled
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
thought
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
'd
have
told
me
you
were
trying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
ate
her
food
in
the
deliberate
,
constrained
way
,
almost
as
if
she
*NL*
recoiled
a
little
from
doing
anything
so
publicly
,
that
he
knew
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
're
glad
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
glad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
it
will
be
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
rather
disappointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
will
be
a
great
deal
,
''
she
said
,
almost
haughtily
,
*NL*
resentfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
think
it
wo
n't
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
think
it
wo
n't
be
a
great
deal
.
Only
you
'll
find
earning
*NL*
your
own
living
is
n't
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
swallowing
with
difficulty
;
``
I
do
n't
suppose
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
work
CAN
be
nearly
everything
to
a
man
,
''
he
said
,
``
though
it
*NL*
is
n't
to
me
.
But
a
woman
only
works
with
a
part
of
herself
.
The
real
and
*NL*
vital
part
is
covered
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
a
man
can
give
ALL
himself
to
work
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
practically
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
woman
only
the
unimportant
part
of
herself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
up
at
him
,
and
her
eyes
dilated
with
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
she
said
,
``
if
it
's
true
,
it
's
a
great
shame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
.
But
I
do
n't
know
everything
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
they
drew
up
to
the
fire
.
He
swung
her
a
chair
facing
him
,
*NL*
and
they
sat
down
.
She
was
wearing
a
dress
of
dark
claret
colour
,
that
*NL*
suited
her
dark
complexion
and
her
large
features
.
Still
,
the
curls
*NL*
were
fine
and
free
,
but
her
face
was
much
older
,
the
brown
throat
much
*NL*
thinner
.
She
seemed
old
to
him
,
older
than
Clara
.
Her
bloom
of
youth
had
*NL*
quickly
gone
.
A
sort
of
stiffness
,
almost
of
woodenness
,
had
come
upon
*NL*
her
.
She
meditated
a
little
while
,
then
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
are
things
with
you
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
all
right
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
,
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
she
said
,
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brown
,
nervous
hands
were
clasped
over
her
knee
.
They
had
still
the
*NL*
lack
of
confidence
or
repose
,
the
almost
hysterical
look
.
He
winced
as
*NL*
he
saw
them
.
Then
he
laughed
mirthlessly
.
She
put
her
fingers
between
*NL*
her
lips
.
His
slim
,
black
,
tortured
body
lay
quite
still
in
the
chair
.
*NL*
She
suddenly
took
her
finger
from
her
mouth
and
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
broken
off
with
Clara
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
body
lay
like
an
abandoned
thing
,
strewn
in
the
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
think
we
ought
to
be
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
since
many
months
,
and
attended
to
*NL*
her
with
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
she
said
,
``
how
you
waste
yourself
!
You
might
be
ill
,
you
might
*NL*
die
,
and
I
never
know
--
be
no
more
then
than
if
I
had
never
known
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
we
married
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
I
could
prevent
you
wasting
yourself
and
being
a
prey
to
*NL*
other
women
--
like
--
like
Clara
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
prey
?
''
he
repeated
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
bowed
her
head
in
silence
.
He
lay
feeling
his
despair
come
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sure
,
''
he
said
slowly
,
``
that
marriage
would
be
much
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
think
of
you
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
do
.
But
--
you
love
me
so
much
,
you
want
to
put
me
in
your
*NL*
pocket
.
And
I
should
die
there
smothered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bent
her
head
,
put
her
fingers
between
her
lips
,
while
the
*NL*
bitterness
surged
up
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
will
you
do
otherwise
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
go
on
,
I
suppose
.
Perhaps
I
shall
soon
go
abroad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
despairing
doggedness
in
his
tone
made
her
go
on
her
knees
on
the
*NL*
rug
before
the
fire
,
very
near
to
him
.
There
she
crouched
as
if
she
were
*NL*
crushed
by
something
,
and
could
not
raise
her
head
.
His
hands
lay
quite
*NL*
inert
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
.
She
was
aware
of
them
.
She
felt
that
*NL*
now
he
lay
at
her
mercy
.
If
she
could
rise
,
take
him
,
put
her
arms
round
*NL*
him
,
and
say
,
``
You
are
mine
,
''
then
he
would
leave
himself
to
her
.
*NL*
But
dare
she
?
She
could
easily
sacrifice
herself
.
But
dare
she
assert
*NL*
herself
?
She
was
aware
of
his
dark-clothed
,
slender
body
,
that
seemed
*NL*
one
stroke
of
life
,
sprawled
in
the
chair
close
to
her
.
But
no
;
she
*NL*
dared
not
put
her
arms
round
it
,
take
it
up
,
and
say
,
``
It
is
mine
,
this
*NL*
body
.
Leave
it
to
me
.
''
And
she
wanted
to
.
It
called
to
all
her
woman
's
*NL*
instinct
.
But
she
crouched
,
and
dared
not
.
She
was
afraid
he
would
*NL*
not
let
her
.
She
was
afraid
it
was
too
much
.
It
lay
there
,
his
body
,
*NL*
abandoned
.
She
knew
she
ought
to
take
it
up
and
claim
it
,
and
claim
*NL*
every
right
to
it
.
But
--
could
she
do
it
?
Her
impotence
before
him
,
*NL*
before
the
strong
demand
of
some
unknown
thing
in
him
,
was
her
*NL*
extremity
.
Her
hands
fluttered
;
she
half-lifted
her
head
.
Her
eyes
,
*NL*
shuddering
,
appealing
,
gone
,
almost
distracted
,
pleaded
to
him
suddenly
.
*NL*
His
heart
caught
with
pity
.
He
took
her
hands
,
drew
her
to
him
,
and
*NL*
comforted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
have
me
,
to
marry
me
?
''
he
said
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
why
did
not
he
take
her
?
Her
very
soul
belonged
to
him
.
Why
would
he
*NL*
not
take
what
was
his
?
She
had
borne
so
long
the
cruelty
of
belonging
to
*NL*
him
and
not
being
claimed
by
him
.
Now
he
was
straining
her
again
.
It
*NL*
was
too
much
for
her
.
She
drew
back
her
head
,
held
his
face
between
her
*NL*
hands
,
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
.
No
,
he
was
hard
.
He
wanted
something
*NL*
else
.
She
pleaded
to
him
with
all
her
love
not
to
make
it
her
choice
.
*NL*
She
could
not
cope
with
it
,
with
him
,
she
knew
not
with
what
.
But
it
*NL*
strained
her
till
she
felt
she
would
break
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
it
?
''
she
asked
,
very
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
,
''
he
replied
,
with
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
face
aside
;
then
,
raising
herself
with
dignity
,
she
took
*NL*
his
head
to
her
bosom
,
and
rocked
him
softly
.
She
was
not
to
have
him
,
*NL*
then
!
So
she
could
comfort
him
.
She
put
her
fingers
through
his
hair
.
*NL*
For
her
,
the
anguished
sweetness
of
self-sacrifice
.
For
him
,
the
hate
*NL*
and
misery
of
another
failure
.
He
could
not
bear
it
--
that
breast
which
*NL*
was
warm
and
which
cradled
him
without
taking
the
burden
of
him
.
So
much
*NL*
he
wanted
to
rest
on
her
that
the
feint
of
rest
only
tortured
him
.
He
*NL*
drew
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
without
marriage
we
can
do
nothing
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mouth
was
lifted
from
his
teeth
with
pain
.
She
put
her
little
finger
*NL*
between
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
,
low
and
like
the
toll
of
a
bell
.
``
No
,
I
think
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
end
then
between
them
.
She
could
not
take
him
and
relieve
him
*NL*
of
the
responsibility
of
himself
.
She
could
only
sacrifice
herself
to
*NL*
him
--
sacrifice
herself
every
day
,
gladly
.
And
that
he
did
not
want
.
He
*NL*
wanted
her
to
hold
him
and
say
,
with
joy
and
authority
:
``
Stop
all
this
*NL*
restlessness
and
beating
against
death
.
You
are
mine
for
a
mate
.
''
She
*NL*
had
not
the
strength
.
Or
was
it
a
mate
she
wanted
?
or
did
she
want
a
*NL*
Christ
in
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
,
in
leaving
her
,
he
was
defrauding
her
of
life
.
But
he
knew
*NL*
that
,
in
staying
,
stilling
the
inner
,
desperate
man
,
he
was
denying
his
*NL*
own
life
.
And
he
did
not
hope
to
give
life
to
her
by
denying
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
very
quiet
.
He
lit
a
cigarette
.
The
smoke
went
up
from
it
,
*NL*
wavering
.
He
was
thinking
of
his
mother
,
and
had
forgotten
Miriam
.
She
*NL*
suddenly
looked
at
him
.
Her
bitterness
came
surging
up
.
Her
sacrifice
,
*NL*
then
,
was
useless
.
He
lay
there
aloof
,
careless
about
her
.
Suddenly
*NL*
she
saw
again
his
lack
of
religion
,
his
restless
instability
.
He
would
*NL*
destroy
himself
like
a
perverse
child
.
Well
,
then
,
he
would
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
must
go
,
''
she
said
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
her
tone
he
knew
she
was
despising
him
.
He
rose
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
along
with
you
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
before
the
mirror
pinning
on
her
hat
.
How
bitter
,
how
*NL*
unutterably
bitter
,
it
made
her
that
he
rejected
her
sacrifice
!
Life
*NL*
ahead
looked
dead
,
as
if
the
glow
were
gone
out
.
She
bowed
her
face
over
*NL*
the
flowers
--
the
freesias
so
sweet
and
spring-like
,
the
scarlet
anemones
*NL*
flaunting
over
the
table
.
It
was
like
him
to
have
those
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
moved
about
the
room
with
a
certain
sureness
of
touch
,
swift
and
*NL*
relentless
and
quiet
.
She
knew
she
could
not
cope
with
him
.
He
would
*NL*
escape
like
a
weasel
out
of
her
hands
.
Yet
without
him
her
life
would
*NL*
trail
on
lifeless
.
Brooding
,
she
touched
the
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
them
!
''
he
said
;
and
he
took
them
out
of
the
jar
,
dripping
as
they
*NL*
were
,
and
went
quickly
into
the
kitchen
.
She
waited
for
him
,
took
the
*NL*
flowers
,
and
they
went
out
together
,
he
talking
,
she
feeling
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
going
from
him
now
.
In
her
misery
she
leaned
against
him
as
they
*NL*
sat
on
the
car
.
He
was
unresponsive
.
Where
would
he
go
?
What
would
*NL*
be
the
end
of
him
?
She
could
not
bear
it
,
the
vacant
feeling
where
he
*NL*
should
be
.
He
was
so
foolish
,
so
wasteful
,
never
at
peace
with
himself
.
*NL*
And
now
where
would
he
go
?
And
what
did
he
care
that
he
wasted
her
?
He
*NL*
had
no
religion
;
it
was
all
for
the
moment
's
attraction
that
he
cared
,
*NL*
nothing
else
,
nothing
deeper
.
Well
,
she
would
wait
and
see
how
it
turned
*NL*
out
with
him
.
When
he
had
had
enough
he
would
give
in
and
come
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
hands
and
left
her
at
the
door
of
her
cousin
's
house
.
When
he
*NL*
turned
away
he
felt
the
last
hold
for
him
had
gone
.
The
town
,
as
he
sat
*NL*
upon
the
car
,
stretched
away
over
the
bay
of
railway
,
a
level
fume
of
*NL*
lights
.
Beyond
the
town
the
country
,
little
smouldering
spots
for
*NL*
more
towns
--
the
sea
--
the
night
--
on
and
on
!
And
he
had
no
place
in
it
!
*NL*
Whatever
spot
he
stood
on
,
there
he
stood
alone
.
From
his
breast
,
*NL*
from
his
mouth
,
sprang
the
endless
space
,
and
it
was
there
behind
him
,
*NL*
everywhere
.
The
people
hurrying
along
the
streets
offered
no
obstruction
*NL*
to
the
void
in
which
he
found
himself
.
They
were
small
shadows
whose
*NL*
footsteps
and
voices
could
be
heard
,
but
in
each
of
them
the
same
night
,
*NL*
the
same
silence
.
He
got
off
the
car
.
In
the
country
all
was
dead
*NL*
still
.
Little
stars
shone
high
up
;
little
stars
spread
far
away
in
the
*NL*
flood-waters
,
a
firmament
below
.
Everywhere
the
vastness
and
terror
of
*NL*
the
immense
night
which
is
roused
and
stirred
for
a
brief
while
by
*NL*
the
day
,
but
which
returns
,
and
will
remain
at
last
eternal
,
holding
*NL*
everything
in
its
silence
and
its
living
gloom
.
There
was
no
Time
,
only
*NL*
Space
.
Who
could
say
his
mother
had
lived
and
did
not
live
?
She
had
been
*NL*
in
one
place
,
and
was
in
another
;
that
was
all
.
And
his
soul
could
not
*NL*
leave
her
,
wherever
she
was
.
Now
she
was
gone
abroad
into
the
night
,
and
*NL*
he
was
with
her
still
.
They
were
together
.
But
yet
there
was
his
body
,
*NL*
his
chest
,
that
leaned
against
the
stile
,
his
hands
on
the
wooden
bar
.
*NL*
They
seemed
something
.
Where
was
he
?
--
one
tiny
upright
speck
of
flesh
,
*NL*
less
than
an
ear
of
wheat
lost
in
the
field
.
He
could
not
bear
it
.
*NL*
On
every
side
the
immense
dark
silence
seemed
pressing
him
,
so
tiny
*NL*
a
spark
,
into
extinction
,
and
yet
,
almost
nothing
,
he
could
not
be
*NL*
extinct
.
Night
,
in
which
everything
was
lost
,
went
reaching
out
,
beyond
*NL*
stars
and
sun
.
Stars
and
sun
,
a
few
bright
grains
,
went
spinning
round
*NL*
for
terror
,
and
holding
each
other
in
embrace
,
there
in
a
darkness
*NL*
that
outpassed
them
all
,
and
left
them
tiny
and
daunted
.
So
much
,
and
*NL*
himself
,
infinitesimal
,
at
the
core
a
nothingness
,
and
yet
not
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
!
''
he
whispered
--
``
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
the
only
thing
that
held
him
up
,
himself
,
amid
all
this
.
And
*NL*
she
was
gone
,
intermingled
herself
.
He
wanted
her
to
touch
him
,
have
him
*NL*
alongside
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
,
he
would
not
give
in
.
Turning
sharply
,
he
walked
towards
the
*NL*
city
's
gold
phosphorescence
.
His
fists
were
shut
,
his
mouth
set
fast
.
He
*NL*
would
not
take
that
direction
,
to
the
darkness
,
to
follow
her
.
He
walked
*NL*
towards
the
faintly
humming
,
glowing
town
,
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
END
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
