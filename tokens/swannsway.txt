OVERTURE
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
I
used
to
go
to
bed
early
.
Sometimes
,
when
I
had
put
out
*NL*
my
candle
,
my
eyes
would
close
so
quickly
that
I
had
not
even
time
to
*NL*
say
``
I
'm
going
to
sleep
.
''
And
half
an
hour
later
the
thought
that
it
was
*NL*
time
to
go
to
sleep
would
awaken
me
;
I
would
try
to
put
away
the
book
*NL*
which
,
I
imagined
,
was
still
in
my
hands
,
and
to
blow
out
the
light
;
I
*NL*
had
been
thinking
all
the
time
,
while
I
was
asleep
,
of
what
I
had
just
*NL*
been
reading
,
but
my
thoughts
had
run
into
a
channel
of
their
own
,
*NL*
until
I
myself
seemed
actually
to
have
become
the
subject
of
my
book
:
*NL*
a
church
,
a
quartet
,
the
rivalry
between
Fran√ßois
I
and
Charles
V
.
This
*NL*
impression
would
persist
for
some
moments
after
I
was
awake
;
it
did
not
*NL*
disturb
my
mind
,
but
it
lay
like
scales
upon
my
eyes
and
prevented
them
*NL*
from
registering
the
fact
that
the
candle
was
no
longer
burning
.
Then
*NL*
it
would
begin
to
seem
unintelligible
,
as
the
thoughts
of
a
former
*NL*
existence
must
be
to
a
reincarnate
spirit
;
the
subject
of
my
book
would
*NL*
separate
itself
from
me
,
leaving
me
free
to
choose
whether
I
would
form
*NL*
part
of
it
or
no
;
and
at
the
same
time
my
sight
would
return
and
I
*NL*
would
be
astonished
to
find
myself
in
a
state
of
darkness
,
pleasant
and
*NL*
restful
enough
for
the
eyes
,
and
even
more
,
perhaps
,
for
my
mind
,
to
*NL*
which
it
appeared
incomprehensible
,
without
a
cause
,
a
matter
dark
*NL*
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
ask
myself
what
o'clock
it
could
be
;
I
could
hear
the
whistling
*NL*
of
trains
,
which
,
now
nearer
and
now
farther
off
,
punctuating
the
*NL*
distance
like
the
note
of
a
bird
in
a
forest
,
shewed
me
in
perspective
*NL*
the
deserted
countryside
through
which
a
traveller
would
be
hurrying
*NL*
towards
the
nearest
station
:
the
path
that
he
followed
being
fixed
for
*NL*
ever
in
his
memory
by
the
general
excitement
due
to
being
in
a
strange
*NL*
place
,
to
doing
unusual
things
,
to
the
last
words
of
conversation
,
to
*NL*
farewells
exchanged
beneath
an
unfamiliar
lamp
which
echoed
still
in
his
*NL*
ears
amid
the
silence
of
the
night
;
and
to
the
delightful
prospect
of
*NL*
being
once
again
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
lay
my
cheeks
gently
against
the
comfortable
cheeks
of
my
*NL*
pillow
,
as
plump
and
blooming
as
the
cheeks
of
babyhood
.
Or
I
would
*NL*
strike
a
match
to
look
at
my
watch
.
Nearly
midnight
.
The
hour
when
an
*NL*
invalid
,
who
has
been
obliged
to
start
on
a
journey
and
to
sleep
in
a
*NL*
strange
hotel
,
awakens
in
a
moment
of
illness
and
sees
with
glad
relief
*NL*
a
streak
of
daylight
shewing
under
his
bedroom
door
.
Oh
,
joy
of
joys
!
*NL*
it
is
morning
.
The
servants
will
be
about
in
a
minute
:
he
can
ring
,
*NL*
and
some
one
will
come
to
look
after
him
.
The
thought
of
being
made
*NL*
comfortable
gives
him
strength
to
endure
his
pain
.
He
is
certain
he
*NL*
heard
footsteps
:
they
come
nearer
,
and
then
die
away
.
The
ray
of
light
*NL*
beneath
his
door
is
extinguished
.
It
is
midnight
;
some
one
has
turned
*NL*
out
the
gas
;
the
last
servant
has
gone
to
bed
,
and
he
must
lie
all
night
*NL*
in
agony
with
no
one
to
bring
him
any
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
fall
asleep
,
and
often
I
would
be
awake
again
for
short
snatches
*NL*
only
,
just
long
enough
to
hear
the
regular
creaking
of
the
wainscot
,
or
*NL*
to
open
my
eyes
to
settle
the
shifting
kaleidoscope
of
the
darkness
,
*NL*
to
savour
,
in
an
instantaneous
flash
of
perception
,
the
sleep
which
lay
*NL*
heavy
upon
the
furniture
,
the
room
,
the
whole
surroundings
of
which
I
*NL*
formed
but
an
insignificant
part
and
whose
unconsciousness
I
should
very
*NL*
soon
return
to
share
.
Or
,
perhaps
,
while
I
was
asleep
I
had
returned
*NL*
without
the
least
effort
to
an
earlier
stage
in
my
life
,
now
for
ever
*NL*
outgrown
;
and
had
come
under
the
thrall
of
one
of
my
childish
terrors
,
*NL*
such
as
that
old
terror
of
my
great-uncle
's
pulling
my
curls
,
which
was
*NL*
effectually
dispelled
on
the
day
--
the
dawn
of
a
new
era
to
me
--
on
which
*NL*
they
were
finally
cropped
from
my
head
.
I
had
forgotten
that
event
*NL*
during
my
sleep
;
I
remembered
it
again
immediately
I
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
making
myself
wake
up
to
escape
my
great-uncle
's
fingers
;
still
,
as
a
*NL*
measure
of
precaution
,
I
would
bury
the
whole
of
my
head
in
the
pillow
*NL*
before
returning
to
the
world
of
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
too
,
just
as
Eve
was
created
from
a
rib
of
Adam
,
so
a
woman
*NL*
would
come
into
existence
while
I
was
sleeping
,
conceived
from
some
*NL*
strain
in
the
position
of
my
limbs
.
Formed
by
the
appetite
that
I
was
*NL*
on
the
point
of
gratifying
,
she
it
was
,
I
imagined
,
who
offered
me
that
*NL*
gratification
.
My
body
,
conscious
that
its
own
warmth
was
permeating
*NL*
hers
,
would
strive
to
become
one
with
her
,
and
I
would
awake
.
The
rest
*NL*
of
humanity
seemed
very
remote
in
comparison
with
this
woman
whose
*NL*
company
I
had
left
but
a
moment
ago
:
my
cheek
was
still
warm
with
her
*NL*
kiss
,
my
body
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
hers
.
If
,
as
would
sometimes
*NL*
happen
,
she
had
the
appearance
of
some
woman
whom
I
had
known
in
waking
*NL*
hours
,
I
would
abandon
myself
altogether
to
the
sole
quest
of
her
,
like
*NL*
people
who
set
out
on
a
journey
to
see
with
their
own
eyes
some
city
*NL*
that
they
have
always
longed
to
visit
,
and
imagine
that
they
can
taste
*NL*
in
reality
what
has
charmed
their
fancy
.
And
then
,
gradually
,
the
memory
*NL*
of
her
would
dissolve
and
vanish
,
until
I
had
forgotten
the
maiden
of
my
*NL*
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
man
is
asleep
,
he
has
in
a
circle
round
him
the
chain
of
the
*NL*
hours
,
the
sequence
of
the
years
,
the
order
of
the
heavenly
host
.
*NL*
Instinctively
,
when
he
awakes
,
he
looks
to
these
,
and
in
an
instant
*NL*
reads
off
his
own
position
on
the
earth
's
surface
and
the
amount
of
time
*NL*
that
has
elapsed
during
his
slumbers
;
but
this
ordered
procession
is
apt
*NL*
to
grow
confused
,
and
to
break
its
ranks
.
Suppose
that
,
towards
morning
,
*NL*
after
a
night
of
insomnia
,
sleep
descends
upon
him
while
he
is
reading
,
*NL*
in
quite
a
different
position
from
that
in
which
he
normally
goes
to
*NL*
sleep
,
he
has
only
to
lift
his
arm
to
arrest
the
sun
and
turn
it
back
*NL*
in
its
course
,
and
,
at
the
moment
of
waking
,
he
will
have
no
idea
of
the
*NL*
time
,
but
will
conclude
that
he
has
just
gone
to
bed
.
Or
suppose
that
he
*NL*
gets
drowsy
in
some
even
more
abnormal
position
;
sitting
in
an
armchair
,
*NL*
say
,
after
dinner
:
then
the
world
will
fall
topsy-turvy
from
its
orbit
,
*NL*
the
magic
chair
will
carry
him
at
full
speed
through
time
and
space
,
*NL*
and
when
he
opens
his
eyes
again
he
will
imagine
that
he
went
to
sleep
*NL*
months
earlier
and
in
some
far
distant
country
.
But
for
me
it
was
enough
*NL*
if
,
in
my
own
bed
,
my
sleep
was
so
heavy
as
completely
to
relax
my
*NL*
consciousness
;
for
then
I
lost
all
sense
of
the
place
in
which
I
had
*NL*
gone
to
sleep
,
and
when
I
awoke
at
midnight
,
not
knowing
where
I
was
,
*NL*
I
could
not
be
sure
at
first
who
I
was
;
I
had
only
the
most
rudimentary
*NL*
sense
of
existence
,
such
as
may
lurk
and
flicker
in
the
depths
of
an
*NL*
animal
's
consciousness
;
I
was
more
destitute
of
human
qualities
than
the
*NL*
cave-dweller
;
but
then
the
memory
,
not
yet
of
the
place
in
which
I
*NL*
was
,
but
of
various
other
places
where
I
had
lived
,
and
might
now
very
*NL*
possibly
be
,
would
come
like
a
rope
let
down
from
heaven
to
draw
me
up
*NL*
out
of
the
abyss
of
not-being
,
from
which
I
could
never
have
escaped
*NL*
by
myself
:
in
a
flash
I
would
traverse
and
surmount
centuries
of
*NL*
civilisation
,
and
out
of
a
half-visualised
succession
of
oil-lamps
,
*NL*
followed
by
shirts
with
turned-down
collars
,
would
put
together
by
*NL*
degrees
the
component
parts
of
my
ego
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
immobility
of
the
things
that
surround
us
is
forced
upon
*NL*
them
by
our
conviction
that
they
are
themselves
,
and
not
anything
else
,
*NL*
and
by
the
immobility
of
our
conceptions
of
them
.
For
it
always
happened
*NL*
that
when
I
awoke
like
this
,
and
my
mind
struggled
in
an
unsuccessful
*NL*
attempt
to
discover
where
I
was
,
everything
would
be
moving
round
me
*NL*
through
the
darkness
:
things
,
places
,
years
.
My
body
,
still
too
heavy
*NL*
with
sleep
to
move
,
would
make
an
effort
to
construe
the
form
which
its
*NL*
tiredness
took
as
an
orientation
of
its
various
members
,
so
as
to
induce
*NL*
from
that
where
the
wall
lay
and
the
furniture
stood
,
to
piece
together
*NL*
and
to
give
a
name
to
the
house
in
which
it
must
be
living
.
Its
memory
,
*NL*
the
composite
memory
of
its
ribs
,
knees
,
and
shoulder-blades
offered
it
*NL*
a
whole
series
of
rooms
in
which
it
had
at
one
time
or
another
slept
;
*NL*
while
the
unseen
walls
kept
changing
,
adapting
themselves
to
the
shape
*NL*
of
each
successive
room
that
it
remembered
,
whirling
madly
through
the
*NL*
darkness
.
And
even
before
my
brain
,
lingering
in
consideration
of
when
*NL*
things
had
happened
and
of
what
they
had
looked
like
,
had
collected
*NL*
sufficient
impressions
to
enable
it
to
identify
the
room
,
it
,
my
body
,
*NL*
would
recall
from
each
room
in
succession
what
the
bed
was
like
,
where
*NL*
the
doors
were
,
how
daylight
came
in
at
the
windows
,
whether
there
was
a
*NL*
passage
outside
,
what
I
had
had
in
my
mind
when
I
went
to
sleep
,
and
had
*NL*
found
there
when
I
awoke
.
The
stiffened
side
underneath
my
body
would
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
in
trying
to
fix
its
position
,
imagine
itself
to
be
lying
,
*NL*
face
to
the
wall
,
in
a
big
bed
with
a
canopy
;
and
at
once
I
would
say
to
*NL*
myself
,
``
Why
,
I
must
have
gone
to
sleep
after
all
,
and
Mamma
never
came
*NL*
to
say
good
night
!
''
for
I
was
in
the
country
with
my
grandfather
,
who
*NL*
died
years
ago
;
and
my
body
,
the
side
upon
which
I
was
lying
,
loyally
*NL*
preserving
from
the
past
an
impression
which
my
mind
should
never
have
*NL*
forgotten
,
brought
back
before
my
eyes
the
glimmering
flame
of
the
*NL*
night-light
in
its
bowl
of
Bohemian
glass
,
shaped
like
an
urn
and
hung
*NL*
by
chains
from
the
ceiling
,
and
the
chimney-piece
of
Siena
marble
in
my
*NL*
bedroom
at
Combray
,
in
my
great-aunt
's
house
,
in
those
far
distant
days
*NL*
which
,
at
the
moment
of
waking
,
seemed
present
without
being
clearly
*NL*
penned
,
but
would
become
plainer
in
a
little
while
when
I
was
properly
*NL*
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
would
come
up
the
memory
of
a
fresh
position
;
the
wall
slid
away
in
*NL*
another
direction
;
I
was
in
my
room
in
Mme.
de
Saint-Loup
's
house
in
the
*NL*
country
;
good
heavens
,
it
must
be
ten
o'clock
,
they
will
have
finished
*NL*
dinner
!
I
must
have
overslept
myself
,
in
the
little
nap
which
I
always
*NL*
take
when
I
come
in
from
my
walk
with
Mme.
de
Saint-Loup
,
before
*NL*
dressing
for
the
evening
.
For
many
years
have
now
elapsed
since
the
*NL*
Combray
days
,
when
,
coming
in
from
the
longest
and
latest
walks
,
I
would
*NL*
still
be
in
time
to
see
the
reflection
of
the
sunset
glowing
in
the
*NL*
panes
of
my
bedroom
window
.
It
is
a
very
different
kind
of
existence
*NL*
at
Tansonville
now
with
Mme.
de
Saint-Loup
,
and
a
different
kind
of
*NL*
pleasure
that
I
now
derive
from
taking
walks
only
in
the
evenings
,
from
*NL*
visiting
by
moonlight
the
roads
on
which
I
used
to
play
,
as
a
child
,
in
*NL*
the
sunshine
;
while
the
bedroom
,
in
which
I
shall
presently
fall
asleep
*NL*
instead
of
dressing
for
dinner
,
from
afar
off
I
can
see
it
,
as
we
return
*NL*
from
our
walk
,
with
its
lamp
shining
through
the
window
,
a
solitary
*NL*
beacon
in
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
shifting
and
confused
gusts
of
memory
never
lasted
for
more
than
*NL*
a
few
seconds
;
it
often
happened
that
,
in
my
spell
of
uncertainty
as
to
*NL*
where
I
was
,
I
did
not
distinguish
the
successive
theories
of
which
that
*NL*
uncertainty
was
composed
any
more
than
,
when
we
watch
a
horse
running
,
*NL*
we
isolate
the
successive
positions
of
its
body
as
they
appear
upon
*NL*
a
bioscope
.
But
I
had
seen
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
rooms
in
*NL*
which
I
had
slept
during
my
life
,
and
in
the
end
I
would
revisit
them
*NL*
all
in
the
long
course
of
my
waking
dream
:
rooms
in
winter
,
where
on
*NL*
going
to
bed
I
would
at
once
bury
my
head
in
a
nest
,
built
up
out
of
the
*NL*
most
diverse
materials
,
the
corner
of
my
pillow
,
the
top
of
my
blankets
,
*NL*
a
piece
of
a
shawl
,
the
edge
of
my
bed
,
and
a
copy
of
an
evening
paper
,
*NL*
all
of
which
things
I
would
contrive
,
with
the
infinite
patience
of
*NL*
birds
building
their
nests
,
to
cement
into
one
whole
;
rooms
where
,
in
*NL*
a
keen
frost
,
I
would
feel
the
satisfaction
of
being
shut
in
from
the
*NL*
outer
world
-LRB-
like
the
sea-swallow
which
builds
at
the
end
of
a
dark
*NL*
tunnel
and
is
kept
warm
by
the
surrounding
earth
-RRB-
,
and
where
,
the
fire
*NL*
keeping
in
all
night
,
I
would
sleep
wrapped
up
,
as
it
were
,
in
a
great
*NL*
cloak
of
snug
and
savoury
air
,
shot
with
the
glow
of
the
logs
which
*NL*
would
break
out
again
in
flame
:
in
a
sort
of
alcove
without
walls
,
a
*NL*
cave
of
warmth
dug
out
of
the
heart
of
the
room
itself
,
a
zone
of
heat
*NL*
whose
boundaries
were
constantly
shifting
and
altering
in
temperature
*NL*
as
gusts
of
air
ran
across
them
to
strike
freshly
upon
my
face
,
from
*NL*
the
corners
of
the
room
,
or
from
parts
near
the
window
or
far
from
the
*NL*
fireplace
which
had
therefore
remained
cold
--
or
rooms
in
summer
,
where
*NL*
I
would
delight
to
feel
myself
a
part
of
the
warm
evening
,
where
the
*NL*
moonlight
striking
upon
the
half-opened
shutters
would
throw
down
to
the
*NL*
foot
of
my
bed
its
enchanted
ladder
;
where
I
would
fall
asleep
,
as
it
*NL*
might
be
in
the
open
air
,
like
a
titmouse
which
the
breeze
keeps
poised
*NL*
in
the
focus
of
a
sunbeam
--
or
sometimes
the
Louis
XVI
room
,
so
cheerful
*NL*
that
I
could
never
feel
really
unhappy
,
even
on
my
first
night
in
it
:
*NL*
that
room
where
the
slender
columns
which
lightly
supported
its
ceiling
*NL*
would
part
,
ever
so
gracefully
,
to
indicate
where
the
bed
was
and
*NL*
to
keep
it
separate
;
sometimes
again
that
little
room
with
the
high
*NL*
ceiling
,
hollowed
in
the
form
of
a
pyramid
out
of
two
separate
storeys
,
*NL*
and
partly
walled
with
mahogany
,
in
which
from
the
first
moment
my
mind
*NL*
was
drugged
by
the
unfamiliar
scent
of
flowering
grasses
,
convinced
of
*NL*
the
hostility
of
the
violet
curtains
and
of
the
insolent
indifference
of
*NL*
a
clock
that
chattered
on
at
the
top
of
its
voice
as
though
I
were
not
*NL*
there
;
while
a
strange
and
pitiless
mirror
with
square
feet
,
which
*NL*
stood
across
one
corner
of
the
room
,
cleared
for
itself
a
site
I
had
not
*NL*
looked
to
find
tenanted
in
the
quiet
surroundings
of
my
normal
field
of
*NL*
vision
:
that
room
in
which
my
mind
,
forcing
itself
for
hours
on
end
*NL*
to
leave
its
moorings
,
to
elongate
itself
upwards
so
as
to
take
on
the
*NL*
exact
shape
of
the
room
,
and
to
reach
to
the
summit
of
that
monstrous
*NL*
funnel
,
had
passed
so
many
anxious
nights
while
my
body
lay
stretched
*NL*
out
in
bed
,
my
eyes
staring
upwards
,
my
ears
straining
,
my
nostrils
*NL*
sniffing
uneasily
,
and
my
heart
beating
;
until
custom
had
changed
the
*NL*
colour
of
the
curtains
,
made
the
clock
keep
quiet
,
brought
an
expression
*NL*
of
pity
to
the
cruel
,
slanting
face
of
the
glass
,
disguised
or
even
*NL*
completely
dispelled
the
scent
of
flowering
grasses
,
and
distinctly
*NL*
reduced
the
apparent
loftiness
of
the
ceiling
.
Custom
!
that
skilful
but
*NL*
unhurrying
manager
who
begins
by
torturing
the
mind
for
weeks
on
end
*NL*
with
her
provisional
arrangements
;
whom
the
mind
,
for
all
that
,
is
*NL*
fortunate
in
discovering
,
for
without
the
help
of
custom
it
would
never
*NL*
contrive
,
by
its
own
efforts
,
to
make
any
room
seem
habitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
I
was
now
well
awake
;
my
body
had
turned
about
for
the
last
*NL*
time
and
the
good
angel
of
certainty
had
made
all
the
surrounding
*NL*
objects
stand
still
,
had
set
me
down
under
my
bedclothes
,
in
my
bedroom
,
*NL*
and
had
fixed
,
approximately
in
their
right
places
in
the
uncertain
*NL*
light
,
my
chest
of
drawers
,
my
writing-table
,
my
fireplace
,
the
window
*NL*
overlooking
the
street
,
and
both
the
doors
.
But
it
was
no
good
my
*NL*
knowing
that
I
was
not
in
any
of
those
houses
of
which
,
in
the
stupid
*NL*
moment
of
waking
,
if
I
had
not
caught
sight
exactly
,
I
could
still
*NL*
believe
in
their
possible
presence
;
for
memory
was
now
set
in
motion
;
as
*NL*
a
rule
I
did
not
attempt
to
go
to
sleep
again
at
once
,
but
used
to
spend
*NL*
the
greater
part
of
the
night
recalling
our
life
in
the
old
days
at
*NL*
Combray
with
my
great-aunt
,
at
Balbec
,
Paris
,
Donci√®res
,
Venice
,
and
the
*NL*
rest
;
remembering
again
all
the
places
and
people
that
I
had
known
,
what
*NL*
I
had
actually
seen
of
them
,
and
what
others
had
told
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Combray
,
as
every
afternoon
ended
,
long
before
the
time
when
I
should
*NL*
have
to
go
up
to
bed
,
and
to
lie
there
,
unsleeping
,
far
from
my
*NL*
mother
and
grandmother
,
my
bedroom
became
the
fixed
point
on
which
my
*NL*
melancholy
and
anxious
thoughts
were
centred
.
Some
one
had
had
the
happy
*NL*
idea
of
giving
me
,
to
distract
me
on
evenings
when
I
seemed
abnormally
*NL*
wretched
,
a
magic
lantern
,
which
used
to
be
set
on
top
of
my
lamp
while
*NL*
we
waited
for
dinner-time
to
come
:
in
the
manner
of
the
master-builders
*NL*
and
glass-painters
of
gothic
days
it
substituted
for
the
opaqueness
*NL*
of
my
walls
an
impalpable
iridescence
,
supernatural
phenomena
of
many
*NL*
colours
,
in
which
legends
were
depicted
,
as
on
a
shifting
and
transitory
*NL*
window
.
But
my
sorrows
were
only
increased
,
because
this
change
of
*NL*
lighting
destroyed
,
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
,
the
customary
*NL*
impression
I
had
formed
of
my
room
,
thanks
to
which
the
room
itself
,
*NL*
but
for
the
torture
of
having
to
go
to
bed
in
it
,
had
become
quite
*NL*
endurable
.
For
now
I
no
longer
recognised
it
,
and
I
became
uneasy
,
as
*NL*
though
I
were
in
a
room
in
some
hotel
or
furnished
lodging
,
in
a
place
*NL*
where
I
had
just
arrived
,
by
train
,
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Riding
at
a
jerky
trot
,
Golo
,
his
mind
filled
with
an
infamous
design
,
*NL*
issued
from
the
little
three-cornered
forest
which
dyed
dark-green
the
*NL*
slope
of
a
convenient
hill
,
and
advanced
by
leaps
and
bounds
towards
the
*NL*
castle
of
poor
Genevi√®ve
de
Brabant
.
This
castle
was
cut
off
short
by
*NL*
a
curved
line
which
was
in
fact
the
circumference
of
one
of
the
*NL*
transparent
ovals
in
the
slides
which
were
pushed
into
position
through
*NL*
a
slot
in
the
lantern
.
It
was
only
the
wing
of
a
castle
,
and
in
front
*NL*
of
it
stretched
a
moor
on
which
Genevi√®ve
stood
,
lost
in
contemplation
,
*NL*
wearing
a
blue
girdle
.
The
castle
and
the
moor
were
yellow
,
but
I
could
*NL*
tell
their
colour
without
waiting
to
see
them
,
for
before
the
slides
*NL*
made
their
appearance
the
old-gold
sonorous
name
of
Brabant
had
given
*NL*
me
an
unmistakable
clue
.
Golo
stopped
for
a
moment
and
listened
sadly
to
*NL*
the
little
speech
read
aloud
by
my
great-aunt
,
which
he
seemed
perfectly
*NL*
to
understand
,
for
he
modified
his
attitude
with
a
docility
not
devoid
*NL*
of
a
degree
of
majesty
,
so
as
to
conform
to
the
indications
given
in
the
*NL*
text
;
then
he
rode
away
at
the
same
jerky
trot
.
And
nothing
could
arrest
*NL*
his
slow
progress
.
If
the
lantern
were
moved
I
could
still
distinguish
*NL*
Golo
's
horse
advancing
across
the
window-curtains
,
swelling
out
with
*NL*
their
curves
and
diving
into
their
folds
.
The
body
of
Golo
himself
,
*NL*
being
of
the
same
supernatural
substance
as
his
steed
's
,
overcame
all
*NL*
material
obstacles
--
everything
that
seemed
to
bar
his
way
--
by
taking
*NL*
each
as
it
might
be
a
skeleton
and
embodying
it
in
himself
:
the
*NL*
door-handle
,
for
instance
,
over
which
,
adapting
itself
at
once
,
would
*NL*
float
invincibly
his
red
cloak
or
his
pale
face
,
never
losing
its
*NL*
nobility
or
its
melancholy
,
never
shewing
any
sign
of
trouble
at
such
a
*NL*
transubstantiation
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
I
found
plenty
of
charm
in
these
bright
projections
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
have
come
straight
out
of
a
Merovingian
past
,
and
to
shed
*NL*
around
me
the
reflections
of
such
ancient
history
.
But
I
can
not
express
*NL*
the
discomfort
I
felt
at
such
an
intrusion
of
mystery
and
beauty
into
*NL*
a
room
which
I
had
succeeded
in
filling
with
my
own
personality
until
*NL*
I
thought
no
more
of
the
room
than
of
myself
.
The
anaesthetic
effect
*NL*
of
custom
being
destroyed
,
I
would
begin
to
think
and
to
feel
very
*NL*
melancholy
things
.
The
door-handle
of
my
room
,
which
was
different
to
*NL*
me
from
all
the
other
doorhandles
in
the
world
,
inasmuch
as
it
seemed
to
*NL*
open
of
its
own
accord
and
without
my
having
to
turn
it
,
so
unconscious
*NL*
had
its
manipulation
become
;
lo
and
behold
,
it
was
now
an
astral
body
*NL*
for
Golo
.
And
as
soon
as
the
dinner-bell
rang
I
would
run
down
to
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
where
the
big
hanging
lamp
,
ignorant
of
Golo
and
Bluebeard
*NL*
but
well
acquainted
with
my
family
and
the
dish
of
stewed
beef
,
shed
the
*NL*
same
light
as
on
every
other
evening
;
and
I
would
fall
into
the
arms
of
*NL*
my
mother
,
whom
the
misfortunes
of
Genevi√®ve
de
Brabant
had
made
all
the
*NL*
dearer
to
me
,
just
as
the
crimes
of
Golo
had
driven
me
to
a
more
than
*NL*
ordinarily
scrupulous
examination
of
my
own
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
dinner
,
alas
,
I
was
soon
obliged
to
leave
Mamma
,
who
stayed
*NL*
talking
with
the
others
,
in
the
garden
if
it
was
fine
,
or
in
the
little
*NL*
parlour
where
everyone
took
shelter
when
it
was
wet
.
Everyone
except
my
*NL*
grandmother
,
who
held
that
``
It
is
a
pity
to
shut
oneself
indoors
in
the
*NL*
country
,
''
and
used
to
carry
on
endless
discussions
with
my
father
on
the
*NL*
very
wettest
days
,
because
he
would
send
me
up
to
my
room
with
a
book
*NL*
instead
of
letting
me
stay
out
of
doors
.
``
That
is
not
the
way
to
make
*NL*
him
strong
and
active
,
''
she
would
say
sadly
,
``
especially
this
little
*NL*
man
,
who
needs
all
the
strength
and
character
that
he
can
get
.
''
My
*NL*
father
would
shrug
his
shoulders
and
study
the
barometer
,
for
he
took
an
*NL*
interest
in
meteorology
,
while
my
mother
,
keeping
very
quiet
so
as
not
*NL*
to
disturb
him
,
looked
at
him
with
tender
respect
,
but
not
too
hard
,
*NL*
not
wishing
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
his
superior
mind
.
But
my
*NL*
grandmother
,
in
all
weathers
,
even
when
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
*NL*
torrents
and
Fran√ßoise
had
rushed
indoors
with
the
precious
wicker
*NL*
armchairs
,
so
that
they
should
not
get
soaked
--
you
would
see
my
*NL*
grandmother
pacing
the
deserted
garden
,
lashed
by
the
storm
,
pushing
*NL*
back
her
grey
hair
in
disorder
so
that
her
brows
might
be
more
free
to
*NL*
imbibe
the
life-giving
draughts
of
wind
and
rain
.
She
would
say
,
``
At
*NL*
last
one
can
breathe
!
''
and
would
run
up
and
down
the
soaking
paths
--
too
*NL*
straight
and
symmetrical
for
her
liking
,
owing
to
the
want
of
any
*NL*
feeling
for
nature
in
the
new
gardener
,
whom
my
father
had
been
asking
*NL*
all
morning
if
the
weather
were
going
to
improve
--
with
her
keen
,
jerky
*NL*
little
step
regulated
by
the
various
effects
wrought
upon
her
soul
by
*NL*
the
intoxication
of
the
storm
,
the
force
of
hygiene
,
the
stupidity
of
*NL*
my
education
and
of
symmetry
in
gardens
,
rather
than
by
any
anxiety
-LRB-
for
*NL*
that
was
quite
unknown
to
her
-RRB-
to
save
her
plum-coloured
skirt
from
the
*NL*
spots
of
mud
under
which
it
would
gradually
disappear
to
a
depth
which
*NL*
always
provided
her
maid
with
a
fresh
problem
and
filled
her
with
fresh
*NL*
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
walks
of
my
grandmother
's
took
place
after
dinner
there
was
*NL*
one
thing
which
never
failed
to
bring
her
back
to
the
house
:
that
was
if
*NL*
-LRB-
at
one
of
those
points
when
the
revolutions
of
her
course
brought
her
,
*NL*
moth-like
,
in
sight
of
the
lamp
in
the
little
parlour
where
the
liqueurs
*NL*
were
set
out
on
the
card-table
-RRB-
my
great-aunt
called
out
to
her
:
*NL*
``
Bathilde
!
Come
in
and
stop
your
husband
from
drinking
brandy
!
''
For
,
*NL*
simply
to
tease
her
-LRB-
she
had
brought
so
foreign
a
type
of
mind
into
my
*NL*
father
's
family
that
everyone
made
a
joke
of
it
-RRB-
,
my
great-aunt
used
to
*NL*
make
my
grandfather
,
who
was
forbidden
liqueurs
,
take
just
a
few
drops
.
*NL*
My
poor
grandmother
would
come
in
and
beg
and
implore
her
husband
not
to
*NL*
taste
the
brandy
;
and
he
would
become
annoyed
and
swallow
his
few
drops
*NL*
all
the
same
,
and
she
would
go
out
again
sad
and
discouraged
,
but
still
*NL*
smiling
,
for
she
was
so
humble
and
so
sweet
that
her
gentleness
towards
*NL*
others
,
and
her
continual
subordination
of
herself
and
of
her
own
*NL*
troubles
,
appeared
on
her
face
blended
in
a
smile
which
,
unlike
those
*NL*
seen
on
the
majority
of
human
faces
,
had
no
trace
in
it
of
irony
,
save
*NL*
for
herself
,
while
for
all
of
us
kisses
seemed
to
spring
from
her
eyes
,
*NL*
which
could
not
look
upon
those
she
loved
without
yearning
to
bestow
*NL*
upon
them
passionate
caresses
.
The
torments
inflicted
on
her
by
my
*NL*
great-aunt
,
the
sight
of
my
grandmother
's
vain
entreaties
,
of
her
in
*NL*
her
weakness
conquered
before
she
began
,
but
still
making
the
futile
*NL*
endeavour
to
wean
my
grandfather
from
his
liqueur-glass
--
all
these
*NL*
were
things
of
the
sort
to
which
,
in
later
years
,
one
can
grow
so
well
*NL*
accustomed
as
to
smile
at
them
,
to
take
the
tormentor
's
side
with
a.
*NL*
happy
determination
which
deludes
one
into
the
belief
that
it
is
not
,
*NL*
really
,
tormenting
;
but
in
those
days
they
filled
me
with
such
horror
*NL*
that
I
longed
to
strike
my
great-aunt
.
And
yet
,
as
soon
as
I
heard
her
*NL*
``
Bathilde
!
Come
in
and
stop
your
husband
from
drinking
brandy
!
''
in
my
*NL*
cowardice
I
became
at
once
a
man
,
and
did
what
all
we
grown
men
do
when
*NL*
face
to
face
with
suffering
and
injustice
;
I
preferred
not
to
see
them
;
*NL*
I
ran
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
to
cry
by
myself
in
a
little
room
*NL*
beside
the
schoolroom
and
beneath
the
roof
,
which
smelt
of
orris-root
,
*NL*
and
was
scented
also
by
a
wild
currant-bush
which
had
climbed
up
between
*NL*
the
stones
of
the
outer
wall
and
thrust
a
flowering
branch
in
through
*NL*
the
half-opened
window
.
Intended
for
a
more
special
and
a
baser
use
,
*NL*
this
room
,
from
which
,
in
the
daytime
,
I
could
see
as
far
as
the
keep
of
*NL*
Roussainville-le-Pin
,
was
for
a
long
time
my
place
of
refuge
,
doubtless
*NL*
because
it
was
the
only
room
whose
door
√è
was
allowed
to
lock
,
whenever
*NL*
my
occupation
was
such
as
required
an
inviolable
solitude
;
reading
or
*NL*
dreaming
,
secret
tears
or
paroxysms
of
desire
.
Alas
!
I
little
knew
*NL*
that
my
own
lack
of
will-power
,
my
delicate
health
,
and
the
consequent
*NL*
uncertainty
as
to
my
future
weighed
far
more
heavily
on
my
grandmother
's
*NL*
mind
than
any
little
breach
of
the
rules
by
her
husband
,
during
those
*NL*
endless
perambulations
,
afternoon
and
evening
,
in
which
we
used
to
see
*NL*
passing
up
and
down
,
obliquely
raised
towards
the
heavens
,
her
handsome
*NL*
face
with
its
brown
and
wrinkled
cheeks
,
which
with
age
had
acquired
*NL*
almost
the
purple
hue
of
tilled
fields
in
autumn
,
covered
,
if
she
were
*NL*
walking
abroad
,
by
a
half-lifted
veil
,
while
upon
them
either
the
*NL*
cold
or
some
sad
reflection
invariably
left
the
drying
traces
of
an
*NL*
involuntary
tear
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
sole
consolation
when
I
went
upstairs
for
the
night
was
that
Mamma
*NL*
would
come
in
and
kiss
me
after
I
was
in
bed
.
But
this
good
night
lasted
*NL*
for
so
short
a
time
:
she
went
down
again
so
soon
that
the
moment
in
*NL*
which
I
heard
her
climb
the
stairs
,
and
then
caught
the
sound
of
her
*NL*
garden
dress
of
blue
muslin
,
from
which
hung
little
tassels
of
plaited
*NL*
straw
,
rustling
along
the
double-doored
corridor
,
was
for
me
a
moment
*NL*
of
the
keenest
sorrow
.
So
much
did
I
love
that
good
night
that
I
reached
*NL*
the
stage
of
hoping
that
it
would
come
as
late
as
possible
,
so
as
*NL*
to
prolong
the
time
of
respite
during
which
Mamma
would
not
yet
have
*NL*
appeared
.
Sometimes
when
,
after
kissing
me
,
she
opened
the
door
to
go
,
I
*NL*
longed
to
call
her
back
,
to
say
to
her
``
Kiss
me
just
once
again
,
''
but
*NL*
I
knew
that
then
she
would
at
once
look
displeased
,
for
the
concession
*NL*
which
she
made
to
my
wretchedness
and
agitation
in
coming
up
to
me
with
*NL*
this
kiss
of
peace
always
annoyed
my
father
,
who
thought
such
ceremonies
*NL*
absurd
,
and
she
would
have
liked
to
try
to
induce
me
to
outgrow
the
*NL*
need
,
the
custom
of
having
her
there
at
all
,
which
was
a
very
different
*NL*
thing
from
letting
the
custom
grow
up
of
my
asking
her
for
an
additional
*NL*
kiss
when
she
was
already
crossing
the
threshold
.
And
to
see
her
look
*NL*
displeased
destroyed
all
the
sense
of
tranquillity
she
had
brought
me
a
*NL*
moment
before
,
when
she
bent
her
loving
face
down
over
my
bed
,
and
held
*NL*
it
out
to
me
like
a
Host
,
for
an
act
of
Communion
in
which
my
lips
might
*NL*
drink
deeply
the
sense
of
her
real
presence
,
and
with
it
the
power
to
*NL*
sleep
.
But
those
evenings
on
which
Mamma
stayed
so
short
a
time
in
*NL*
my
room
were
sweet
indeed
compared
to
those
on
which
we
had
guests
*NL*
to
dinner
,
and
therefore
she
did
not
come
at
all
.
Our
`
guests
'
*NL*
were
practically
limited
to
M.
Swann
,
who
,
apart
from
a
few
passing
*NL*
strangers
,
was
almost
the
only
person
who
ever
came
to
the
house
at
*NL*
Combray
,
sometimes
to
a
neighbourly
dinner
-LRB-
but
less
frequently
since
*NL*
his
unfortunate
marriage
,
as
my
family
did
not
care
to
receive
his
wife
-RRB-
*NL*
and
sometimes
after
dinner
,
uninvited
.
On
those
evenings
when
,
as
we
sat
*NL*
in
front
of
the
house
beneath
the
big
chestnut-tree
and
round
the
iron
*NL*
table
,
we
heard
,
from
the
far
end
of
the
garden
,
not
the
large
and
*NL*
noisy
rattle
which
heralded
and
deafened
as
he
approached
with
its
*NL*
ferruginous
,
interminable
,
frozen
sound
any
member
of
the
household
who
*NL*
had
put
it
out
of
action
by
coming
in
`
without
ringing
,
'
but
the
double
*NL*
peal
--
timid
,
oval
,
gilded
--
of
the
visitors
'
bell
,
everyone
would
at
once
*NL*
exclaim
``
A
visitor
!
Who
in
the
world
can
it
be
?
''
but
they
knew
quite
*NL*
well
that
it
could
only
be
M.
Swann
.
My
great-aunt
,
speaking
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
,
to
set
an
example
,
in
a
tone
which
she
endeavoured
to
make
sound
*NL*
natural
,
would
tell
the
others
not
to
whisper
so
;
that
nothing
could
be
*NL*
more
unpleasant
for
a
stranger
coming
in
,
who
would
be
led
to
think
that
*NL*
people
were
saying
things
about
him
which
he
was
not
meant
to
hear
;
and
*NL*
then
my
grandmother
would
be
sent
out
as
a
scout
,
always
happy
to
find
*NL*
an
excuse
for
an
additional
turn
in
the
garden
,
which
she
would
utilise
*NL*
to
remove
surreptitiously
,
as
she
passed
,
the
stakes
of
a
rose-tree
or
*NL*
two
,
so
as
to
make
the
roses
look
a
little
more
natural
,
as
a
mother
*NL*
might
run
her
hand
through
her
boy
's
hair
,
after
the
barber
had
smoothed
*NL*
it
down
,
to
make
it
stick
out
properly
round
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
we
would
all
stay
,
hanging
on
the
words
which
would
fall
from
*NL*
my
grandmother
's
lips
when
she
brought
us
back
her
report
of
the
*NL*
enemy
,
as
though
there
had
been
some
uncertainty
among
a
vast
number
of
*NL*
possible
invaders
,
and
then
,
soon
after
,
my
grandfather
would
say
:
``
I
*NL*
can
hear
Swann
's
voice
.
''
And
,
indeed
,
one
could
tell
him
only
by
his
*NL*
voice
,
for
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
his
face
with
its
arched
nose
*NL*
and
green
eyes
,
under
a
high
forehead
fringed
with
fair
,
almost
red
*NL*
hair
,
dressed
in
the
Bressant
style
,
because
in
the
garden
we
used
as
*NL*
little
light
as
possible
,
so
as
not
to
attract
mosquitoes
:
and
I
would
*NL*
slip
away
as
though
not
going
for
anything
in
particular
,
to
tell
them
*NL*
to
bring
out
the
syrups
;
for
my
grandmother
made
a
great
point
,
thinking
*NL*
it
`
nicer
'
of
their
not
being
allowed
to
seem
anything
out
of
the
*NL*
ordinary
,
which
we
kept
for
visitors
only
.
Although
a
far
younger
man
,
*NL*
M.
Swann
was
very
much
attached
to
my
grandfather
,
who
had
been
an
*NL*
intimate
friend
,
in
his
time
,
of
Swann
's
father
,
an
excellent
but
an
*NL*
eccentric
man
in
whom
the
least
little
thing
would
,
it
seemed
,
often
*NL*
check
the
flow
of
his
spirits
and
divert
the
current
of
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
Several
times
in
the
course
of
a
year
I
would
hear
my
grandfather
tell
*NL*
at
table
the
story
,
which
never
varied
,
of
the
behaviour
of
M.
Swann
the
*NL*
elder
upon
the
death
of
his
wife
,
by
whose
bedside
he
had
watched
*NL*
day
and
night
.
My
grandfather
,
who
had
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
hastened
to
join
him
at
the
Swanns
'
family
property
on
the
outskirts
of
*NL*
Combray
,
and
managed
to
entice
him
for
a
moment
,
weeping
profusely
,
out
*NL*
of
the
death-chamber
,
so
that
he
should
not
be
present
when
the
body
was
*NL*
laid
in
its
coffin
.
They
took
a
turn
or
two
in
the
park
,
where
there
was
*NL*
a
little
sunshine
.
Suddenly
M.
Swann
seized
my
grandfather
by
the
arm
*NL*
and
cried
,
``
Oh
,
my
dear
old
friend
,
how
fortunate
we
are
to
be
walking
*NL*
here
together
on
such
a
charming
day
!
Do
n't
you
see
how
pretty
they
are
,
*NL*
all
these
trees
--
my
hawthorns
,
and
my
new
pond
,
on
which
you
have
never
*NL*
congratulated
me
?
You
look
as
glum
as
a
night-cap
.
Do
n't
you
feel
this
*NL*
little
breeze
?
Ah
!
whatever
you
may
say
,
it
's
good
to
be
alive
all
the
*NL*
same
,
my
dear
Am√©d√©e
!
''
And
then
,
abruptly
,
the
memory
of
his
dead
wife
*NL*
returned
to
him
,
and
probably
thinking
it
too
complicated
to
inquire
*NL*
into
how
,
at
such
a
time
,
he
could
have
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
*NL*
away
by
an
impulse
of
happiness
,
he
confined
himself
to
a
gesture
which
*NL*
he
habitually
employed
whenever
any
perplexing
question
came
into
his
*NL*
mind
:
that
is
,
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
,
dried
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
wiped
his
glasses
.
And
he
could
never
be
consoled
for
the
loss
of
*NL*
his
wife
,
but
used
to
say
to
my
grandfather
,
during
the
two
years
for
*NL*
which
he
survived
her
,
``
It
's
a
funny
thing
,
now
;
I
very
often
think
*NL*
of
my
poor
wife
,
but
I
can
not
think
of
her
very
much
at
any
one
time
.
''
*NL*
``
Often
,
but
a
little
at
a
time
,
like
poor
old
Swann
,
''
became
one
of
my
*NL*
grandfather
's
favourite
phrases
,
which
he
would
apply
to
all
kinds
of
*NL*
things
.
And
I
should
have
assumed
that
this
father
of
Swann
's
had
been
*NL*
a
monster
if
my
grandfather
,
whom
I
regarded
as
a
better
judge
than
*NL*
myself
,
and
whose
word
was
my
law
and
often
led
me
in
the
long
run
to
*NL*
pardon
offences
which
I
should
have
been
inclined
to
condemn
,
had
not
*NL*
gone
on
to
exclaim
,
``
But
,
after
all
,
he
had
a
heart
of
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
years
,
albeit
--
and
especially
before
his
marriage
--
M.
Swann
*NL*
the
younger
came
often
to
see
them
at
Combray
,
my
great-aunt
and
*NL*
grandparents
never
suspected
that
he
had
entirely
ceased
to
live
in
the
*NL*
kind
of
society
which
his
family
had
frequented
,
or
that
,
under
the
*NL*
sort
of
incognito
which
the
name
of
Swann
gave
him
among
us
,
they
were
*NL*
harbouring
--
with
the
complete
innocence
of
a
family
of
honest
innkeepers
*NL*
who
have
in
their
midst
some
distinguished
highwayman
and
never
know
*NL*
it
--
one
of
the
smartest
members
of
the
Jockey
Club
,
a
particular
friend
*NL*
of
the
Comte
de
Paris
and
of
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
and
one
of
the
*NL*
men
most
sought
after
in
the
aristocratic
world
of
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Germain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
utter
ignorance
of
the
brilliant
part
which
Swann
was
playing
in
*NL*
the
world
of
fashion
was
,
of
course
,
due
in
part
to
his
own
reserve
and
*NL*
discretion
,
but
also
to
the
fact
that
middle-class
people
in
those
days
*NL*
took
what
was
almost
a
Hindu
view
of
society
,
which
they
held
to
consist
*NL*
of
sharply
defined
castes
,
so
that
everyone
at
his
birth
found
himself
*NL*
called
to
that
station
in
life
which
his
parents
already
occupied
,
*NL*
and
nothing
,
except
the
chance
of
a
brilliant
career
or
of
a
`
good
'
*NL*
marriage
,
could
extract
you
from
that
station
or
admit
you
to
a
superior
*NL*
caste
.
M.
Swann
,
the
father
,
had
been
a
stockbroker
;
and
so
`
young
*NL*
Swann
'
found
himself
immured
for
life
in
a
caste
where
one
's
fortune
,
as
*NL*
in
a
list
of
taxpayers
,
varied
between
such
and
such
limits
of
income
.
*NL*
We
knew
the
people
with
whom
his
father
had
associated
,
and
so
we
knew
*NL*
his
own
associates
,
the
people
with
whom
he
was
`
in
a
position
to
mix
.
'
*NL*
If
he
knew
other
people
besides
,
those
were
youthful
acquaintances
on
*NL*
whom
the
old
friends
of
the
family
,
like
my
relatives
,
shut
their
eyes
*NL*
all
the
more
good-naturedly
that
Swann
himself
,
after
he
was
left
an
*NL*
orphan
,
still
came
most
faithfully
to
see
us
;
but
we
would
have
been
*NL*
ready
to
wager
that
the
people
outside
our
acquaintance
whom
Swann
knew
*NL*
were
of
the
sort
to
whom
he
would
not
have
dared
to
raise
his
hat
,
had
*NL*
he
met
them
while
he
was
walking
with
ourselves
.
Had
there
been
such
a
*NL*
thing
as
a
determination
to
apply
to
Swann
a
social
coefficient
peculiar
*NL*
to
himself
,
as
distinct
from
all
the
other
sons
of
other
stockbrokers
in
*NL*
his
father
's
position
,
his
coefficient
would
have
been
rather
lower
than
*NL*
theirs
,
because
,
leading
a
very
simple
life
,
and
having
always
had
*NL*
a
craze
for
`
antiques
'
and
pictures
,
he
now
lived
and
piled
up
his
*NL*
collections
in
an
old
house
which
my
grandmother
longed
to
visit
,
*NL*
but
which
stood
on
the
Quai
d'Orl√©ans
,
a
neighbourhood
in
which
my
*NL*
great-aunt
thought
it
most
degrading
to
be
quartered
.
``
Are
you
really
*NL*
a
connoisseur
,
now
?
''
she
would
say
to
him
;
``
I
ask
for
your
own
sake
,
as
*NL*
you
are
likely
to
have
`
fakes
'
palmed
off
on
you
by
the
dealers
,
''
for
*NL*
she
did
not
,
in
fact
,
endow
him
with
any
critical
faculty
,
and
had
no
*NL*
great
opinion
of
the
intelligence
of
a
man
who
,
in
conversation
,
would
*NL*
avoid
serious
topics
and
shewed
a
very
dull
preciseness
,
not
only
when
*NL*
he
gave
us
kitchen
recipes
,
going
into
the
most
minute
details
,
but
*NL*
even
when
my
grandmother
's
sisters
were
talking
to
him
about
art
.
When
*NL*
challenged
by
them
to
give
an
opinion
,
or
to
express
his
admiration
for
*NL*
some
picture
,
he
would
remain
almost
impolitely
silent
,
and
would
then
*NL*
make
amends
by
furnishing
-LRB-
if
he
could
-RRB-
some
fact
or
other
about
the
*NL*
gallery
in
which
the
picture
was
hung
,
or
the
date
at
which
it
had
been
*NL*
painted
.
But
as
a
rule
he
would
content
himself
with
trying
to
amuse
*NL*
us
by
telling
us
the
story
of
his
latest
adventure
--
and
he
would
have
*NL*
a
fresh
story
for
us
on
every
occasion
--
with
some
one
whom
we
ourselves
*NL*
knew
,
such
as
the
Combray
chemist
,
or
our
cook
,
or
our
coachman
.
These
*NL*
stories
certainly
used
to
make
my
great-aunt
laugh
,
but
she
could
*NL*
never
tell
whether
that
was
on
account
of
the
absurd
parts
which
Swann
*NL*
invariably
made
himself
play
in
the
adventures
,
or
of
the
wit
that
he
*NL*
shewed
in
telling
us
of
them
.
``
It
is
easy
to
see
that
you
are
a
regular
*NL*
`
character
,
'
M.
Swann
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
the
only
member
of
our
family
who
could
be
described
as
a
*NL*
trifle
`
common
,
'
she
would
always
take
care
to
remark
to
strangers
,
when
*NL*
Swann
was
mentioned
,
that
he
could
easily
,
if
he
had
wished
to
,
have
*NL*
lived
in
the
Boulevard
Haussmann
or
the
Avenue
de
l'Op√©ra
,
and
that
*NL*
he
was
the
son
of
old
M.
Swann
who
must
have
left
four
or
five
million
*NL*
francs
,
but
that
it
was
a
fad
of
his
.
A
fad
which
,
moreover
,
she
thought
*NL*
was
bound
to
amuse
other
people
so
much
that
in
Paris
,
when
M.
Swann
*NL*
called
on
New
Year
's
Day
bringing
her
a
little
packet
of
_
marrons
*NL*
glac√©s
_
,
she
never
failed
,
if
there
were
strangers
in
the
room
,
to
say
*NL*
to
him
:
``
Well
,
M.
Swann
,
and
do
you
still
live
next
door
to
the
Bonded
*NL*
Vaults
,
so
as
to
be
sure
of
not
missing
your
train
when
you
go
to
*NL*
Lyons
?
''
and
she
would
peep
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
,
over
her
*NL*
glasses
,
at
the
other
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
anyone
had
suggested
to
my
aunt
that
this
Swann
,
who
,
in
his
*NL*
capacity
as
the
son
of
old
M.
Swann
,
was
`
fully
qualified
'
to
be
*NL*
received
by
any
of
the
`
upper
middle
class
,
'
the
most
respected
*NL*
barristers
and
solicitors
of
Paris
-LRB-
though
he
was
perhaps
a
trifle
*NL*
inclined
to
let
this
hereditary
privilege
go
into
abeyance
-RRB-
,
had
another
*NL*
almost
secret
existence
of
a
wholly
different
kind
:
that
when
he
left
*NL*
our
house
in
Paris
,
saying
that
he
must
go
home
to
bed
,
he
would
no
*NL*
sooner
have
turned
the
corner
than
he
would
stop
,
retrace
his
steps
,
and
*NL*
be
off
to
some
drawing-room
on
whose
like
no
stockbroker
or
associate
*NL*
of
stockbrokers
had
ever
set
eyes
--
that
would
have
seemed
to
my
aunt
*NL*
as
extraordinary
as
,
to
a
woman
of
wider
reading
,
the
thought
of
being
*NL*
herself
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
Aristaeus
,
of
knowing
that
he
would
,
*NL*
when
he
had
finished
his
conversation
with
her
,
plunge
deep
into
the
*NL*
realms
of
Thetis
,
into
an
empire
veiled
from
mortal
eyes
,
in
which
*NL*
Virgil
depicts
him
as
being
received
with
open
arms
;
or
--
to
be
content
*NL*
with
an
image
more
likely
to
have
occurred
to
her
,
for
she
had
seen
it
*NL*
painted
on
the
plates
we
used
for
biscuits
at
Combray
--
as
the
thought
*NL*
of
having
had
to
dinner
Ali
Baba
,
who
,
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
alone
*NL*
and
unobserved
,
would
make
his
way
into
the
cave
,
resplendent
with
its
*NL*
unsuspected
treasures
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
he
had
come
to
see
us
after
dinner
in
Paris
,
and
had
begged
*NL*
pardon
for
being
in
evening
clothes
,
Fran√ßoise
,
when
he
had
gone
,
told
*NL*
us
that
she
had
got
it
from
his
coachman
that
he
had
been
dining
``
with
a
*NL*
princess
.
''
``
A
pretty
sort
of
princess
,
''
drawled
my
aunt
;
``
I
know
*NL*
them
,
''
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
without
raising
her
eyes
from
her
*NL*
knitting
,
serenely
ironical
.
*NL*
*NL*
Altogether
,
my
aunt
used
to
treat
him
with
scant
ceremony
.
Since
she
was
*NL*
of
the
opinion
that
he
ought
to
feel
flattered
by
our
invitations
,
she
*NL*
thought
it
only
right
and
proper
that
he
should
never
come
to
see
us
in
*NL*
summer
without
a
basket
of
peaches
or
raspberries
from
his
garden
,
*NL*
and
that
from
each
of
his
visits
to
Italy
he
should
bring
back
some
*NL*
photographs
of
old
masters
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
quite
natural
,
therefore
,
to
send
to
him
whenever
we
wanted
*NL*
a
recipe
for
some
special
sauce
or
for
a
pineapple
salad
for
one
of
*NL*
our
big
dinner-parties
,
to
which
he
himself
would
not
be
invited
,
not
*NL*
seeming
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
served
up
to
new
friends
who
*NL*
might
be
in
our
house
for
the
first
time
.
If
the
conversation
turned
*NL*
upon
the
Princes
of
the
House
of
France
,
``
Gentlemen
,
you
and
I
will
*NL*
never
know
,
will
we
,
and
do
n't
want
to
,
do
we
?
''
my
great-aunt
would
*NL*
say
tartly
to
Swann
,
who
had
,
perhaps
,
a
letter
from
Twickenham
in
his
*NL*
pocket
;
she
would
make
him
play
accompaniments
and
turn
over
music
on
*NL*
evenings
when
my
grandmother
's
sister
sang
;
manipulating
this
creature
,
*NL*
so
rare
and
refined
at
other
times
and
in
other
places
,
with
the
rough
*NL*
simplicity
of
a
child
who
will
play
with
some
curio
from
the
cabinet
no
*NL*
more
carefully
than
if
it
were
a
penny
toy
.
Certainly
the
Swann
who
was
*NL*
a
familiar
figure
in
all
the
clubs
of
those
days
differed
hugely
from
,
*NL*
the
Swann
created
in
my
great-aunt
's
mind
when
,
of
an
evening
,
in
our
*NL*
little
garden
at
Combray
,
after
the
two
shy
peals
had
sounded
from
the
*NL*
gate
,
she
would
vitalise
,
by
injecting
into
it
everything
she
had
ever
*NL*
heard
about
the
Swann
family
,
the
vague
and
unrecognisable
shape
which
*NL*
began
to
appear
,
with
my
grandmother
in
its
wake
,
against
a
background
*NL*
of
shadows
,
and
could
at
last
be
identified
by
the
sound
of
its
voice
.
*NL*
But
then
,
even
in
the
most
insignificant
details
of
our
daily
life
,
none
*NL*
of
us
can
be
said
to
constitute
a
material
whole
,
which
is
identical
for
*NL*
everyone
,
and
need
only
be
turned
up
like
a
page
in
an
account-book
or
*NL*
the
record
of
a
will
;
our
social
personality
is
created
by
the
thoughts
*NL*
of
other
people
.
Even
the
simple
act
which
we
describe
as
``
seeing
some
*NL*
one
we
know
''
is
,
to
some
extent
,
an
intellectual
process
.
We
pack
the
*NL*
physical
outline
of
the
creature
we
see
with
all
the
ideas
we
have
*NL*
already
formed
about
him
,
and
in
the
complete
picture
of
him
which
we
*NL*
compose
in
our
minds
those
ideas
have
certainly
the
principal
place
.
In
*NL*
the
end
they
come
to
fill
out
so
completely
the
curve
of
his
cheeks
,
to
*NL*
follow
so
exactly
the
line
of
his
nose
,
they
blend
so
harmoniously
in
*NL*
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
these
seem
to
be
no
more
than
a
transparent
*NL*
envelope
,
so
that
each
time
we
see
the
face
or
hear
the
voice
it
is
our
*NL*
own
ideas
of
him
which
we
recognise
and
to
which
we
listen
.
And
so
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
from
the
Swann
they
had
built
up
for
their
own
purposes
my
family
*NL*
had
left
out
,
in
their
ignorance
,
a
whole
crowd
of
the
details
of
his
*NL*
daily
life
in
the
world
of
fashion
,
details
by
means
of
which
other
*NL*
people
,
when
they
met
him
,
saw
all
the
Graces
enthroned
in
his
face
and
*NL*
stopping
at
the
line
of
his
arched
nose
as
at
a
natural
frontier
;
but
*NL*
they
contrived
also
to
put
into
a
face
from
which
its
distinction
had
*NL*
been
evicted
,
a
face
vacant
and
roomy
as
an
untenanted
house
,
to
plant
*NL*
in
the
depths
of
its
unvalued
eyes
a
lingering
sense
,
uncertain
but
not
*NL*
unpleasing
,
half-memory
and
half-oblivion
,
of
idle
hours
spent
together
*NL*
after
our
weekly
dinners
,
round
the
card-table
or
in
the
garden
,
during
*NL*
our
companionable
country
life
.
Our
friend
's
bodily
frame
had
been
so
*NL*
well
lined
with
this
sense
,
and
with
various
earlier
memories
of
his
*NL*
family
,
that
their
own
special
Swann
had
become
to
my
people
a
complete
*NL*
and
living
creature
;
so
that
even
now
I
have
the
feeling
of
leaving
*NL*
some
one
I
know
for
another
quite
different
person
when
,
going
back
in
*NL*
memory
,
I
pass
from
the
Swann
whom
I
knew
later
and
more
intimately
*NL*
to
this
early
Swann
--
this
early
Swann
in
whom
I
can
distinguish
the
*NL*
charming
mistakes
of
my
childhood
,
and
who
,
incidentally
,
is
less
like
*NL*
his
successor
than
he
is
like
the
other
people
I
knew
at
that
time
,
as
*NL*
though
one
's
life
were
a
series
of
galleries
in
which
all
the
portraits
*NL*
of
any
one
period
had
a
marked
family
likeness
,
the
same
-LRB-
so
to
speak
-RRB-
*NL*
tonality
--
this
early
Swann
abounding
in
leisure
,
fragrant
with
the
scent
*NL*
of
the
great
chestnut-tree
,
of
baskets
of
raspberries
and
of
a
sprig
of
*NL*
tarragon
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
one
day
,
when
my
grandmother
had
gone
to
ask
some
favour
of
a
*NL*
lady
whom
she
had
known
at
the
Sacr√©
Coeur
-LRB-
and
with
whom
,
because
of
*NL*
our
caste
theory
,
she
had
not
cared
to
keep
up
any
degree
of
intimacy
in
*NL*
spite
of
several
common
interests
-RRB-
,
the
Marquise
de
Villeparisis
,
of
the
*NL*
famous
house
of
Bouillon
,
this
lady
had
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
know
M.
Swann
very
well
;
he
is
a
great
friend
of
my
*NL*
nephews
,
the
des
Laumes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
had
returned
from
the
call
full
of
praise
for
the
house
,
*NL*
which
overlooked
some
gardens
,
and
in
which
Mme.
de
Villeparisis
had
*NL*
advised
her
to
rent
a
flat
;
and
also
for
a
repairing
tailor
and
his
*NL*
daughter
,
who
kept
a
little
shop
in
the
courtyard
,
into
which
she
had
*NL*
gone
to
ask
them
to
put
a
stitch
in
her
skirt
,
which
she
had
torn
on
the
*NL*
staircase
.
My
grandmother
had
found
these
people
perfectly
charming
:
the
*NL*
girl
,
she
said
,
was
a
jewel
,
and
the
tailor
a
most
distinguished
man
,
*NL*
the
finest
she
had
ever
seen
.
For
in
her
eyes
distinction
was
a
thing
*NL*
wholly
independent
of
social
position
.
She
was
in
ecstasies
over
some
*NL*
answer
the
tailor
had
made
,
saying
to
Mamma
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
S√©vign√©
would
not
have
said
it
better
!
''
and
,
by
way
of
contrast
,
of
a
*NL*
nephew
of
Mme.
de
Villeparisis
whom
she
had
met
at
the
house
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
he
is
so
common
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
effect
of
that
remark
about
Swann
had
been
,
not
to
raise
him
*NL*
in
my
great-aunt
's
estimation
,
but
to
lower
Mme.
de
Villeparisis
.
It
*NL*
appeared
that
the
deference
which
,
on
my
grandmother
's
authority
,
we
*NL*
owed
to
Mme.
de
Villeparisis
imposed
on
her
the
reciprocal
obligation
to
*NL*
do
nothing
that
would
render
her
less
worthy
of
our
regard
,
and
that
*NL*
she
had
failed
in
her
duty
in
becoming
aware
of
Swann
's
existence
and
*NL*
in
allowing
members
of
her
family
to
associate
with
him
.
``
How
should
*NL*
she
know
Swann
?
A
lady
who
,
you
always
made
out
,
was
related
to
Marshal
*NL*
MacMahon
!
''
This
view
of
Swann
's
social
atmosphere
which
prevailed
in
my
*NL*
family
seemed
to
be
confirmed
later
on
by
his
marriage
with
a
woman
of
*NL*
the
worst
class
,
you
might
almost
say
a
`
fast
'
woman
,
whom
,
to
do
him
*NL*
justice
,
he
never
attempted
to
introduce
to
us
,
for
he
continued
to
come
*NL*
to
us
alone
,
though
he
came
more
and
more
seldom
;
but
from
whom
they
*NL*
thought
they
could
establish
,
on
the
assumption
that
he
had
found
her
*NL*
there
,
the
circle
,
unknown
to
them
,
in
which
he
ordinarily
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
one
occasion
my
grandfather
read
in
a
newspaper
that
M.
Swann
was
*NL*
one
of
the
most
faithful
attendants
at
the
Sunday
luncheons
given
by
the
*NL*
Duc
de
X
--
,
whose
father
and
uncle
had
been
among
our
most
prominent
*NL*
statesmen
in
the
reign
of
Louis
Philippe
.
Now
my
grandfather
was
curious
*NL*
to
learn
all
the
little
details
which
might
help
him
to
take
a
mental
*NL*
share
in
the
private
lives
of
men
like
Mole
,
the
Duc
Pasquier
,
or
the
*NL*
Duc
de
Broglie
.
He
was
delighted
to
find
that
Swann
associated
with
*NL*
people
who
had
known
them
.
My
great-aunt
,
however
,
interpreted
this
*NL*
piece
of
news
in
a
sense
discreditable
to
Swann
;
for
anyone
who
chose
*NL*
his
associates
outside
the
caste
in
which
he
had
been
born
and
bred
,
*NL*
outside
his
`
proper
station
,
'
was
condemned
to
utter
degradation
in
her
*NL*
eyes
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
such
a
one
abdicated
all
claim
to
enjoy
the
*NL*
fruits
of
those
friendly
relations
with
people
of
good
position
which
*NL*
prudent
parents
cultivate
and
store
up
for
their
children
's
benefit
,
for
*NL*
my
great-aunt
had
actually
ceased
to
`
see
'
the
son
of
a
lawyer
we
*NL*
had
known
because
he
had
married
a
`
Highness
'
and
had
thereby
stepped
*NL*
down
--
in
her
eyes
--
from
the
respectable
position
of
a
lawyer
's
son
to
*NL*
that
of
those
adventurers
,
upstart
footmen
or
stable-boys
mostly
,
*NL*
to
whom
we
read
that
queens
have
sometimes
shewn
their
favours
.
She
*NL*
objected
,
therefore
,
to
my
grandfather
's
plan
of
questioning
Swann
,
when
*NL*
next
he
came
to
dine
with
us
,
about
these
people
whose
friendship
with
*NL*
him
we
had
discovered
.
On
the
other
hand
,
my
grandmother
's
two
sisters
,
*NL*
elderly
spinsters
who
shared
her
nobility
of
character
but
lacked
her
*NL*
intelligence
,
declared
that
they
could
not
conceive
what
pleasure
their
*NL*
brother-in-law
could
find
in
talking
about
such
trifles
.
They
were
*NL*
ladies
of
lofty
ambition
,
who
for
that
reason
were
incapable
of
taking
*NL*
the
least
interest
in
what
might
be
called
the
`
pinchbeck
'
things
of
*NL*
life
,
even
when
they
had
an
historic
value
,
or
,
generally
speaking
,
in
*NL*
anything
that
was
not
directly
associated
with
some
object
aesthetically
*NL*
precious
.
So
complete
was
their
negation
of
interest
in
anything
which
*NL*
seemed
directly
or
indirectly
a
part
of
our
everyday
life
that
their
*NL*
sense
of
hearing
--
which
had
gradually
come
to
understand
its
own
*NL*
futility
when
the
tone
of
the
conversation
,
at
the
dinner-table
,
became
*NL*
frivolous
or
merely
mundane
,
without
the
two
old
ladies
'
being
able
to
*NL*
guide
it
back
to
the
topic
dear
to
themselves
--
would
leave
its
receptive
*NL*
channels
unemployed
,
so
effectively
that
they
were
actually
becoming
*NL*
atrophied
.
So
that
if
my
grandfather
wished
to
attract
the
attention
of
*NL*
the
two
sisters
,
he
would
have
to
make
use
of
some
such
alarm
signals
*NL*
as
mad-doctors
adopt
in
dealing
with
their
distracted
patients
;
as
by
*NL*
beating
several
times
on
a
glass
with
the
blade
of
a
knife
,
fixing
them
*NL*
at
the
same
time
with
a
sharp
word
and
a
compelling
glance
,
violent
*NL*
methods
which
the
said
doctors
are
apt
to
bring
with
them
into
their
*NL*
everyday
life
among
the
sane
,
either
from
force
of
professional
habit
or
*NL*
because
they
think
the
whole
world
a
trifle
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
interest
grew
,
however
,
when
,
the
day
before
Swann
was
to
dine
*NL*
with
us
,
and
when
he
had
made
them
a
special
present
of
a
case
of
Asti
,
*NL*
my
great-aunt
,
who
had
in
her
hand
a
copy
of
the
_
Figaro
_
in
which
to
*NL*
the
name
of
a
picture
then
on
view
in
a
Corot
exhibition
were
added
the
*NL*
words
,
``
from
the
collection
of
M.
Charles
Swann
,
''
asked
:
``
Did
you
see
*NL*
that
Swann
is
`
mentioned
'
in
the
_
Figaro
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
always
told
you
,
''
said
my
grandmother
,
``
that
he
had
plenty
*NL*
of
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
,
of
course
,
''
retorted
my
great-aunt
,
``
say
anything
just
to
*NL*
seem
different
from
_
us
_
.
''
For
,
knowing
that
my
grandmother
never
agreed
*NL*
with
her
,
and
not
being
quite
confident
that
it
was
her
own
opinion
*NL*
which
the
rest
of
us
invariably
endorsed
,
she
wished
to
extort
from
us
*NL*
a
wholesale
condemnation
of
my
grandmother
's
views
,
against
which
she
*NL*
hoped
to
force
us
into
solidarity
with
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
sat
silent
.
My
grandmother
's
sisters
having
expressed
a
desire
*NL*
to
mention
to
Swann
this
reference
to
him
in
the
_
Figaro
_
,
my
great-aunt
*NL*
dissuaded
them
.
Whenever
she
saw
in
others
an
advantage
,
however
*NL*
trivial
,
which
she
herself
lacked
,
she
would
persuade
herself
that
it
*NL*
was
no
advantage
at
all
,
but
a
drawback
,
and
would
pity
so
as
not
to
*NL*
have
to
envy
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
that
would
please
him
at
all
;
I
know
very
well
,
I
should
*NL*
hate
to
see
my
name
printed
like
that
,
as
large
as
life
,
in
the
paper
,
*NL*
and
I
should
n't
feel
at
all
flattered
if
anyone
spoke
to
me
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
,
however
,
put
any
very
great
pressure
upon
my
grandmother
's
*NL*
sisters
,
for
they
,
in
their
horror
of
vulgarity
,
had
brought
to
such
a
*NL*
fine
art
the
concealment
of
a
personal
allusion
in
a
wealth
of
ingenious
*NL*
circumlocution
,
that
it
would
often
pass
unnoticed
even
by
the
person
*NL*
to
whom
it
was
addressed
.
As
for
my
mother
,
her
only
thought
was
of
*NL*
managing
to
induce
my
father
to
consent
to
speak
to
Swann
,
not
of
his
*NL*
wife
,
but
of
his
daughter
,
whom
he
worshipped
,
and
for
whose
sake
it
was
*NL*
understood
that
he
had
ultimately
made
his
unfortunate
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
only
say
a
word
;
just
ask
him
how
she
is
.
It
must
be
so
very
*NL*
hard
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
however
,
was
annoyed
:
``
No
,
no
;
you
have
the
most
absurd
*NL*
ideas
.
It
would
be
utterly
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
only
one
of
us
in
whom
the
prospect
of
Swann
's
arrival
gave
*NL*
rise
to
an
unhappy
foreboding
was
myself
.
And
that
was
because
on
the
*NL*
evenings
when
there
were
visitors
,
or
just
M.
Swann
in
the
house
,
Mamma
*NL*
did
not
come
up
to
my
room
.
I
did
not
,
at
that
time
,
have
dinner
with
*NL*
the
family
:
I
came
out
to
the
garden
after
dinner
,
and
at
nine
I
said
*NL*
good
night
and
went
to
bed
.
But
on
these
evenings
I
used
to
dine
earlier
*NL*
than
the
others
,
and
to
come
in
afterwards
and
sit
at
table
until
eight
*NL*
o'clock
,
when
it
was
understood
that
I
must
go
upstairs
;
that
frail
and
*NL*
precious
kiss
which
Mamma
used
always
to
leave
upon
my
lips
when
I
*NL*
was
in
bed
and
just
going
to
sleep
I
had
to
take
with
me
from
the
*NL*
dining-room
to
my
own
,
and
to
keep
inviolate
all
the
time
that
it
*NL*
took
me
to
undress
,
without
letting
its
sweet
charm
be
broken
,
without
*NL*
letting
its
volatile
essence
diffuse
itself
and
evaporate
;
and
just
on
*NL*
those
very
evenings
when
I
must
needs
take
most
pains
to
receive
it
with
*NL*
due
formality
,
I
had
to
snatch
it
,
to
seize
it
instantly
and
in
public
,
*NL*
without
even
having
the
time
or
being
properly
free
to
apply
to
what
I
*NL*
was
doing
the
punctiliousness
which
madmen
use
who
compel
themselves
to
*NL*
exclude
all
other
thoughts
from
their
minds
while
they
are
shutting
a
*NL*
door
,
so
that
when
the
sickness
of
uncertainty
sweeps
over
them
again
*NL*
they
can
triumphantly
face
and
overcome
it
with
the
recollection
of
the
*NL*
precise
moment
in
which
the
door
was
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
all
in
the
garden
when
the
double
peal
of
the
gate-bell
sounded
*NL*
shyly
.
Everyone
knew
that
it
must
be
Swann
,
and
yet
they
looked
at
one
*NL*
another
inquiringly
and
sent
my
grandmother
scouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
that
you
thank
him
intelligibly
for
the
wine
,
''
my
grandfather
*NL*
warned
his
two
sisters-in-law
;
``
you
know
how
good
it
is
,
and
it
is
a
*NL*
huge
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
do
n't
start
whispering
!
''
said
my
great-aunt
.
``
How
would
you
like
*NL*
to
come
into
a
house
and
find
everyone
muttering
to
themselves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
There
's
M.
Swann
,
''
cried
my
father
.
``
Let
's
ask
him
if
he
thinks
it
*NL*
will
be
fine
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
fancied
that
a
word
from
her
would
wipe
out
all
the
*NL*
unpleasantness
which
my
family
had
contrived
to
make
Swann
feel
since
*NL*
his
marriage
.
She
found
an
opportunity
to
draw
him
aside
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
But
I
followed
her
:
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
let
her
go
out
of
reach
*NL*
of
me
while
I
felt
that
in
a
few
minutes
I
should
have
to
leave
her
in
*NL*
the
dining-room
and
go
up
to
my
bed
without
the
consoling
thought
,
as
on
*NL*
ordinary
evenings
,
that
she
would
come
up
,
later
,
to
kiss
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
M.
Swann
,
''
she
said
,
``
do
tell
me
about
your
daughter
;
I
am
sure
*NL*
she
shews
a
taste
already
for
nice
things
,
like
her
papa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
and
sit
down
here
with
us
all
on
the
verandah
,
''
said
my
*NL*
grandfather
,
coming
up
to
him
.
My
mother
had
to
abandon
the
quest
,
but
*NL*
managed
to
extract
from
the
restriction
itself
a
further
refinement
of
*NL*
thought
,
as
great
poets
do
when
the
tyranny
of
rhyme
forces
them
into
*NL*
the
discovery
of
their
finest
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
talk
about
her
again
when
we
are
by
ourselves
,
''
she
said
,
or
*NL*
rather
whispered
to
Swann
.
``
It
is
only
a
mother
who
can
understand
.
I
am
*NL*
sure
that
hers
would
agree
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
we
all
sat
down
round
the
iron
table
.
I
should
have
liked
not
*NL*
to
think
of
the
hours
of
anguish
which
I
should
have
to
spend
,
that
*NL*
evening
,
alone
in
my
room
,
without
the
possibility
of
going
to
sleep
:
I
*NL*
tried
to
convince
myself
that
they
were
of
no
importance
,
really
,
*NL*
since
I
should
have
forgotten
them
next
morning
,
and
to
fix
my
mind
on
*NL*
thoughts
of
the
future
which
would
carry
me
,
as
on
a
bridge
,
across
the
*NL*
terrifying
abyss
that
yawned
at
my
feet
.
But
my
mind
,
strained
by
this
*NL*
foreboding
,
distended
like
the
look
which
I
shot
at
my
mother
,
would
not
*NL*
allow
any
other
impression
to
enter
.
Thoughts
did
,
indeed
,
enter
it
,
*NL*
but
only
on
the
condition
that
they
left
behind
them
every
element
of
*NL*
beauty
,
or
even
of
quaintness
,
by
which
I
might
have
been
distracted
or
*NL*
beguiled
.
As
a
surgical
patient
,
by
means
of
a
local
anaesthetic
,
can
*NL*
look
on
with
a
clear
consciousness
while
an
operation
is
being
performed
*NL*
upon
him
and
yet
feel
nothing
,
I
could
repeat
to
myself
some
favourite
*NL*
lines
,
or
watch
my
grandfather
attempting
to
talk
to
Swann
about
the
Duc
*NL*
d'Audriffet-Pasquier
,
without
being
able
to
kindle
any
emotion
from
one
*NL*
or
amusement
from
the
other
.
Hardly
had
my
grandfather
begun
to
question
*NL*
Swann
about
that
orator
when
one
of
my
grandmother
's
sisters
,
in
whose
*NL*
ears
the
question
echoed
like
a
solemn
but
untimely
silence
which
her
*NL*
natural
politeness
bade
her
interrupt
,
addressed
the
other
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
fancy
,
Flora
,
I
met
a
young
Swedish
governess
to-day
who
told
*NL*
me
some
most
interesting
things
about
the
co-operative
movement
in
*NL*
Scandinavia
.
We
really
must
have
her
to
dine
here
one
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
!
''
said
her
sister
Flora
,
``
but
I
have
n't
wasted
my
time
*NL*
either
.
I
met
such
a
clever
old
gentleman
at
M.
Vinteuil
's
who
knows
*NL*
Maubant
quite
well
,
and
Maubant
has
told
him
every
little
thing
about
*NL*
how
he
gets
up
his
parts
.
It
is
the
most
interesting
thing
I
ever
heard
.
*NL*
He
is
a
neighbour
of
M.
Vinteuil
's
,
and
I
never
knew
;
and
he
is
so
nice
*NL*
besides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Vinteuil
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
nice
neighbours
,
''
cried
my
aunt
*NL*
C√©line
in
a
voice
which
seemed
loud
because
she
was
so
timid
,
and
seemed
*NL*
forced
because
she
had
been
planning
the
little
speech
for
so
long
;
*NL*
darting
,
as
she
spoke
,
what
she
called
a
`
significant
glance
'
at
Swann
.
*NL*
And
my
aunt
Flora
,
who
realised
that
this
veiled
utterance
was
C√©line
's
*NL*
way
of
thanking
Swann
intelligibly
for
the
Asti
,
looked
at
him
with
a
*NL*
blend
of
congratulation
and
irony
,
either
just
,
because
she
wished
to
*NL*
underline
her
sister
's
little
epigram
,
or
because
she
envied
Swann
*NL*
his
having
inspired
it
,
or
merely
because
she
imagined
that
he
was
*NL*
embarrassed
,
and
could
not
help
having
a
little
fun
at
his
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
would
be
worth
while
,
''
Flora
went
on
,
``
to
have
this
old
*NL*
gentleman
to
dinner
.
When
you
get
him
upon
Maubant
or
Mme.
Materna
he
*NL*
will
talk
for
hours
on
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
be
delightful
,
''
sighed
my
grandfather
,
in
whose
mind
nature
*NL*
had
unfortunately
forgotten
to
include
any
capacity
whatsoever
for
*NL*
becoming
passionately
interested
in
the
co-operative
movement
among
the
*NL*
ladies
of
Sweden
or
in
the
methods
employed
by
Maubant
to
get
up
his
*NL*
parts
,
just
as
it
had
forgotten
to
endow
my
grandmother
's
two
sisters
*NL*
with
a
grain
of
that
precious
salt
which
one
has
oneself
to
`
add
to
*NL*
taste
'
in
order
to
extract
any
savour
from
a
narrative
of
the
private
*NL*
life
of
Mole
or
of
the
Comte
de
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
!
''
exclaimed
Swann
to
my
grandfather
,
``
what
I
was
going
to
tell
*NL*
you
has
more
to
do
than
you
might
think
with
what
you
were
asking
me
*NL*
just
now
,
for
in
some
respects
there
has
been
very
little
change
.
I
came
*NL*
across
a
passage
in
Saint-Simon
this
morning
which
would
have
amused
*NL*
you
.
It
is
in
the
volume
which
covers
his
mission
to
Spain
;
not
one
*NL*
of
the
best
,
little
more
in
fact
than
a
journal
,
but
at
least
it
is
a
*NL*
journal
wonderfully
well
written
,
which
fairly
distinguishes
it
from
*NL*
the
devastating
journalism
that
we
feel
bound
to
read
in
these
days
,
*NL*
morning
,
noon
and
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
agree
with
you
:
there
are
some
days
when
I
find
reading
the
*NL*
papers
very
pleasant
indeed
!
''
my
aunt
Flora
broke
in
,
to
show
Swann
that
*NL*
she
had
read
the
note
about
his
Corot
in
the
_
Figaro
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
aunt
C√©line
went
one
better
.
``
When
they
write
about
things
or
*NL*
people
in
whom
we
are
interested
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
deny
it
,
''
answered
Swann
in
some
bewilderment
.
``
The
fault
I
*NL*
find
with
our
journalism
is
that
it
forces
us
to
take
an
interest
in
*NL*
some
fresh
triviality
or
other
every
day
,
whereas
only
three
or
four
*NL*
books
in
a
lifetime
give
us
anything
that
is
of
real
importance
.
Suppose
*NL*
that
,
every
morning
,
when
we
tore
the
wrapper
off
our
paper
with
fevered
*NL*
hands
,
a
transmutation
were
to
take
place
,
and
we
were
to
find
inside
*NL*
it
--
oh
!
I
do
n't
know
;
shall
we
say
Pascal
's
_
Pens√©es
_
?
''
He
articulated
*NL*
the
title
with
an
ironic
emphasis
so
as
not
to
appear
pedantic
.
``
And
*NL*
then
,
in
the
gilt
and
tooled
volumes
which
we
open
once
in
ten
years
,
''
*NL*
he
went
on
,
shewing
that
contempt
for
the
things
of
this
world
which
*NL*
some
men
of
the
world
like
to
affect
,
``
we
should
read
that
the
Queen
of
*NL*
the
Hellenes
had
arrived
at
Cannes
,
or
that
the
Princesse
de
L√©on
had
*NL*
given
a
fancy
dress
ball
.
In
that
way
we
should
arrive
at
the
right
*NL*
proportion
between
`
information
'
and
`
publicity
.
'
''
But
at
once
*NL*
regretting
that
he
had
allowed
himself
to
speak
,
even
in
jest
,
of
*NL*
serious
matters
,
he
added
ironically
:
``
We
are
having
a
most
entertaining
*NL*
conversation
;
I
can
not
think
why
we
climb
to
these
lofty
summits
,
''
and
*NL*
then
,
turning
to
my
grandfather
:
``
Well
,
Saint-Simon
tells
how
Maulevrier
*NL*
had
had
the
audacity
to
offer
his
hand
to
his
sons
.
You
remember
how
he
*NL*
says
of
Maulevrier
,
`
Never
did
I
find
in
that
coarse
bottle
anything
but
*NL*
ill-humour
,
boorishness
,
and
folly
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coarse
or
not
,
I
know
bottles
in
which
there
is
something
very
*NL*
different
!
''
said
Flora
briskly
,
feeling
bound
to
thank
Swann
as
well
as
*NL*
her
sister
,
since
the
present
of
Asti
had
been
addressed
to
them
both
.
*NL*
C√©line
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
was
puzzled
,
but
went
on
:
''
'
I
can
not
say
whether
it
was
his
*NL*
ignorance
or
a
trap
,
'
writes
Saint-Simon
;
`
he
wished
to
give
his
hand
to
*NL*
my
children
.
I
noticed
it
in
time
to
prevent
him
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandfather
was
already
in
ecstasies
over
``
ignorance
or
a
trap
,
''
*NL*
but
Miss
C√©line
--
the
name
of
Saint-Simon
,
a
`
man
of
letters
,
'
having
*NL*
arrested
the
complete
paralysis
of
her
sense
of
hearing
--
had
grown
*NL*
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
You
admire
that
,
do
you
?
Well
,
it
is
clever
enough
!
But
what
is
*NL*
the
point
of
it
?
Does
he
mean
that
one
man
is
n't
as
good
as
another
?
*NL*
What
difference
can
it
make
whether
he
is
a
duke
or
a
groom
so
long
*NL*
as
he
is
intelligent
and
good
?
He
had
a
fine
way
of
bringing
up
his
*NL*
children
,
your
Saint-Simon
,
if
he
did
n't
teach
them
to
shake
hands
with
*NL*
all
honest
men
.
Really
and
truly
,
it
's
abominable
.
And
you
dare
to
quote
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
my
grandfather
,
utterly
depressed
,
realising
how
futile
it
would
be
*NL*
for
him
,
against
this
opposition
,
to
attempt
to
get
Swann
to
tell
him
*NL*
the
stories
which
would
have
amused
him
,
murmured
to
my
mother
:
``
Just
*NL*
tell
me
again
that
line
of
yours
which
always
comforts
me
so
much
on
*NL*
these
occasions
.
Oh
,
yes
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
virtues
,
Lord
,
Thou
makest
us
abhor
!
*NL*
*NL*
Good
,
that
is
,
very
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
took
my
eyes
off
my
mother
.
I
knew
that
when
they
were
at
table
*NL*
I
should
not
be
permitted
to
stay
there
for
the
whole
of
dinner-time
,
*NL*
and
that
Mamma
,
for
fear
of
annoying
my
father
,
would
not
allow
me
to
*NL*
give
her
in
public
the
series
of
kisses
that
she
would
have
had
in
my
*NL*
room
.
And
so
I
promised
myself
that
in
the
dining-room
,
as
they
began
*NL*
to
eat
and
drink
and
as
I
felt
the
hour
approach
,
I
would
put
beforehand
*NL*
into
this
kiss
,
which
was
bound
to
be
so
brief
and
stealthy
in
*NL*
execution
,
everything
that
my
own
efforts
could
put
into
it
:
would
*NL*
look
out
very
carefully
first
the
exact
spot
on
her
cheek
where
I
would
*NL*
imprint
it
,
and
would
so
prepare
my
thoughts
that
I
might
be
able
,
*NL*
thanks
to
these
mental
preliminaries
,
to
consecrate
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
minute
Mamma
would
allow
me
to
the
sensation
of
her
cheek
against
my
*NL*
lips
,
as
a
painter
who
can
have
his
subject
for
short
sittings
only
*NL*
prepares
his
palette
,
and
from
what
he
remembers
and
from
rough
notes
*NL*
does
in
advance
everything
which
he
possibly
can
do
in
the
sitter
's
*NL*
absence
.
But
to-night
,
before
the
dinner-bell
had
sounded
,
my
*NL*
grandfather
said
with
unconscious
cruelty
:
``
The
little
man
looks
tired
;
*NL*
he
'd
better
go
up
to
bed
.
Besides
,
we
are
dining
late
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
my
father
,
who
was
less
scrupulous
than
my
grandmother
or
mother
in
*NL*
observing
the
letter
of
a
treaty
,
went
on
:
``
Yes
,
run
along
;
to
bed
with
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
have
kissed
Mamma
then
and
there
,
but
at
that
moment
the
*NL*
dinner-bell
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
leave
your
mother
alone
.
You
've
said
good
night
quite
enough
.
*NL*
These
exhibitions
are
absurd
.
Go
on
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
I
must
set
forth
without
viaticum
;
must
climb
each
step
of
the
*NL*
staircase
`
against
my
heart
,
'
as
the
saying
is
,
climbing
in
opposition
*NL*
to
my
heart
's
desire
,
which
was
to
return
to
my
mother
,
since
she
had
*NL*
not
,
by
her
kiss
,
given
my
heart
leave
to
accompany
me
forth
.
That
*NL*
hateful
staircase
,
up
which
I
always
passed
with
such
dismay
,
gave
out
*NL*
a
smell
of
varnish
which
had
to
some
extent
absorbed
,
made
definite
and
*NL*
fixed
the
special
quality
of
sorrow
that
I
felt
each
evening
,
and
made
*NL*
it
perhaps
even
more
cruel
to
my
sensibility
because
,
when
it
assumed
*NL*
this
olfactory
guise
,
my
intellect
was
powerless
to
resist
it
.
When
we
*NL*
have
gone
to
sleep
with
a
maddening
toothache
and
are
conscious
of
it
*NL*
only
as
a
little
girl
whom
we
attempt
,
time
after
time
,
to
pull
out
*NL*
of
the
water
,
or
as
a
line
of
Moli√®re
which
we
repeat
incessantly
to
*NL*
ourselves
,
it
is
a
great
relief
to
wake
up
,
so
that
our
intelligence
*NL*
can
disentangle
the
idea
of
toothache
from
any
artificial
semblance
of
*NL*
heroism
or
rhythmic
cadence
.
It
was
the
precise
converse
of
this
relief
*NL*
which
I
felt
when
my
anguish
at
having
to
go
up
to
my
room
invaded
my
*NL*
consciousness
in
a
manner
infinitely
more
rapid
,
instantaneous
almost
,
*NL*
a
manner
at
once
insidious
and
brutal
as
I
breathed
in
--
a
far
more
*NL*
poisonous
thing
than
any
moral
penetration
--
the
peculiar
smell
of
the
*NL*
varnish
upon
that
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
in
my
room
I
had
to
stop
every
loophole
,
to
close
the
shutters
,
to
*NL*
dig
my
own
grave
as
I
turned
down
the
bed-clothes
,
to
wrap
myself
in
the
*NL*
shroud
of
my
nightshirt
.
But
before
burying
myself
in
the
iron
bed
which
*NL*
had
been
placed
there
because
,
on
summer
nights
,
I
was
too
hot
among
the
*NL*
red
curtains
of
the
four-poster
,
I
was
stirred
to
revolt
,
and
attempted
*NL*
the
desperate
stratagem
of
a
condemned
prisoner
.
I
wrote
to
my
mother
*NL*
begging
her
to
come
upstairs
for
an
important
reason
which
I
could
not
*NL*
put
in
writing
.
My
fear
was
that
Fran√ßoise
,
my
aunt
's
cook
who
used
to
*NL*
be
put
in
charge
of
me
when
I
was
at
Combray
,
might
refuse
to
take
my
*NL*
note
.
I
had
a
suspicion
that
,
in
her
eyes
,
to
carry
a
message
to
*NL*
my
mother
when
there
was
a
stranger
in
the
room
would
appear
flatly
*NL*
inconceivable
,
just
as
it
would
be
for
the
door-keeper
of
a
theatre
*NL*
to
hand
a
letter
to
an
actor
upon
the
stage
.
For
things
which
might
*NL*
or
might
not
be
done
she
possessed
a
code
at
once
imperious
,
abundant
,
*NL*
subtle
,
and
uncompromising
on
points
themselves
imperceptible
or
*NL*
irrelevant
,
which
gave
it
a
resemblance
to
those
ancient
laws
which
*NL*
combine
such
cruel
ordinances
as
the
massacre
of
infants
at
the
breast
*NL*
with
prohibitions
,
of
exaggerated
refinement
,
against
``
seething
the
kid
*NL*
in
his
mother
's
milk
,
''
or
``
eating
of
the
sinew
which
is
upon
the
hollow
*NL*
of
the
thigh
.
''
This
code
,
if
one
could
judge
it
by
the
sudden
obstinacy
*NL*
which
she
would
put
into
her
refusal
to
carry
out
certain
of
our
*NL*
instructions
,
seemed
to
have
foreseen
such
social
complications
and
*NL*
refinements
of
fashion
as
nothing
in
Fran√ßoise
's
surroundings
or
in
her
*NL*
career
as
a
servant
in
a
village
household
could
have
put
into
her
head
;
*NL*
and
we
were
obliged
to
assume
that
there
was
latent
in
her
some
past
*NL*
existence
in
the
ancient
history
of
France
,
noble
and
little
understood
,
*NL*
just
as
there
is
in
those
manufacturing
towns
where
old
mansions
still
*NL*
testify
to
their
former
courtly
days
,
and
chemical
workers
toil
among
*NL*
delicately
sculptured
scenes
of
the
Miracle
of
Theophilus
or
the
Quatre
*NL*
Fils
Aymon
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
particular
instance
,
the
article
of
her
code
which
made
it
*NL*
highly
improbable
that
--
barring
an
outbreak
of
fire
--
Fran√ßoise
would
*NL*
go
down
and
disturb
Mamma
when
M.
Swann
was
there
for
so
unimportant
a
*NL*
person
as
myself
was
one
embodying
the
respect
she
shewed
not
only
for
*NL*
the
family
-LRB-
as
for
the
dead
,
for
the
clergy
,
or
for
royalty
-RRB-
,
but
also
*NL*
for
the
stranger
within
our
gates
;
a
respect
which
I
should
perhaps
have
*NL*
found
touching
in
a
book
,
but
which
never
failed
to
irritate
me
on
her
*NL*
lips
,
because
of
the
solemn
and
gentle
tones
in
which
she
would
utter
*NL*
it
,
and
which
irritated
me
more
than
usual
this
evening
when
the
sacred
*NL*
character
in
which
she
invested
the
dinner-party
might
have
the
effect
*NL*
of
making
her
decline
to
disturb
its
ceremonial
.
But
to
give
myself
one
*NL*
chance
of
success
I
lied
without
hesitation
,
telling
her
that
it
was
not
*NL*
in
the
least
myself
who
had
wanted
to
write
to
Mamma
,
but
Mamma
who
,
*NL*
on
saying
good
night
to
me
,
had
begged
me
not
to
forget
to
send
her
*NL*
an
answer
about
something
she
had
asked
me
to
find
,
and
that
she
would
*NL*
certainly
be
very
angry
if
this
note
were
not
taken
to
her
.
I
think
that
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
disbelieved
me
,
for
,
like
those
primitive
men
whose
senses
*NL*
were
so
much
keener
than
our
own
,
she
could
immediately
detect
,
by
signs
*NL*
imperceptible
by
the
rest
of
us
,
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
anything
that
*NL*
we
might
wish
to
conceal
from
her
.
She
studied
the
envelope
for
five
*NL*
minutes
as
though
an
examination
of
the
paper
itself
and
the
look
of
*NL*
my
handwriting
could
enlighten
her
as
to
the
nature
of
the
contents
,
*NL*
or
tell
her
to
which
article
of
her
code
she
ought
to
refer
the
matter
.
*NL*
Then
she
went
out
with
an
air
of
resignation
which
seemed
to
imply
:
*NL*
``
What
a
dreadful
thing
for
parents
to
have
a
child
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
she
returned
to
say
that
they
were
still
at
the
ice
stage
*NL*
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
butler
to
deliver
the
note
at
once
,
*NL*
in
front
of
everybody
;
but
that
when
the
finger-bowls
were
put
round
he
*NL*
would
find
a
way
of
slipping
it
into
Mamma
's
hand
.
At
once
my
anxiety
*NL*
subsided
;
it
was
now
no
longer
-LRB-
as
it
had
been
a
moment
ago
-RRB-
until
*NL*
to-morrow
that
I
had
lost
my
mother
,
for
my
little
line
was
going
--
to
*NL*
annoy
her
,
no
doubt
,
and
doubly
so
because
this
contrivance
would
make
*NL*
me
ridiculous
in
Swann
's
eyes
--
but
was
going
all
the
same
to
admit
me
,
*NL*
invisibly
and
by
stealth
,
into
the
same
room
as
herself
,
was
going
*NL*
to
whisper
from
me
into
her
ear
;
for
that
forbidden
and
unfriendly
*NL*
dining-room
,
where
but
a
moment
ago
the
ice
itself
--
with
burned
nuts
in
*NL*
it
--
and
the
finger-bowls
seemed
to
me
to
be
concealing
pleasures
that
*NL*
were
mischievous
and
of
a
mortal
sadness
because
Mamma
was
tasting
of
*NL*
them
and
I
was
far
away
,
had
opened
its
doors
to
me
and
,
like
a
ripe
*NL*
fruit
which
bursts
through
its
skin
,
was
going
to
pour
out
into
my
*NL*
intoxicated
heart
the
gushing
sweetness
of
Mamma
's
attention
while
she
*NL*
was
reading
what
I
had
written
.
Now
I
was
no
longer
separated
from
her
;
*NL*
the
barriers
were
down
;
an
exquisite
thread
was
binding
us
.
Besides
,
*NL*
that
was
not
all
,
for
surely
Mamma
would
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
agony
through
which
I
had
just
passed
,
I
imagined
that
Swann
*NL*
would
have
laughed
heartily
at
it
if
he
had
read
my
letter
and
had
*NL*
guessed
its
purpose
;
whereas
,
on
the
contrary
,
as
I
was
to
learn
in
due
*NL*
course
,
a
similar
anguish
had
been
the
bane
of
his
life
for
many
years
,
*NL*
and
no
one
perhaps
could
have
understood
my
feelings
at
that
moment
so
*NL*
well
as
himself
;
to
him
,
that
anguish
which
lies
in
knowing
that
the
*NL*
creature
one
adores
is
in
some
place
of
enjoyment
where
oneself
is
not
*NL*
and
can
not
follow
--
to
him
that
anguish
came
through
Love
,
to
which
it
*NL*
is
in
a
sense
predestined
,
by
which
it
must
be
equipped
and
adapted
;
but
*NL*
when
,
as
had
befallen
me
,
such
an
anguish
possesses
one
's
soul
before
*NL*
Love
has
yet
entered
into
one
's
life
,
then
it
must
drift
,
awaiting
*NL*
Love
's
coming
,
vague
and
free
,
without
precise
attachment
,
at
the
*NL*
disposal
of
one
sentiment
to-day
,
of
another
to-morrow
,
of
filial
piety
*NL*
or
affection
for
a
comrade
.
And
the
joy
with
which
I
first
bound
myself
*NL*
apprentice
,
when
Fran√ßoise
returned
to
tell
me
that
my
letter
would
be
*NL*
delivered
;
Swann
,
too
,
had
known
well
that
false
joy
which
a
friend
can
*NL*
give
us
,
or
some
relative
of
the
woman
we
love
,
when
on
his
arrival
at
*NL*
the
house
or
theatre
where
she
is
to
be
found
,
for
some
ball
or
party
or
*NL*
`
first-night
'
at
which
he
is
to
meet
her
,
he
sees
us
wandering
outside
,
*NL*
desperately
awaiting
some
opportunity
of
communicating
with
her
.
He
*NL*
recognises
us
,
greets
us
familiarly
,
and
asks
what
we
are
doing
there
.
*NL*
And
when
we
invent
a
story
of
having
some
urgent
message
to
give
to
his
*NL*
relative
or
friend
,
he
assures
us
that
nothing
could
be
more
simple
,
*NL*
takes
us
in
at
the
door
,
and
promises
to
send
her
down
to
us
in
five
*NL*
minutes
.
How
much
we
love
him
--
as
at
that
moment
I
loved
Fran√ßoise
--
the
*NL*
good-natured
intermediary
who
by
a
single
word
has
made
supportable
,
*NL*
human
,
almost
propitious
the
inconceivable
,
infernal
scene
of
gaiety
in
*NL*
the
thick
of
which
we
had
been
imagining
swarms
of
enemies
,
perverse
and
*NL*
seductive
,
beguiling
away
from
us
,
even
making
laugh
at
us
,
the
woman
*NL*
whom
we
love
.
If
we
are
to
judge
of
them
by
him
,
this
relative
who
has
*NL*
accosted
us
and
who
is
himself
an
initiate
in
those
cruel
mysteries
,
*NL*
then
the
other
guests
can
not
be
so
very
demoniacal
.
Those
inaccessible
*NL*
and
torturing
hours
into
which
she
had
gone
to
taste
of
unknown
*NL*
pleasures
--
behold
,
a
breach
in
the
wall
,
and
we
are
through
it
.
Behold
,
*NL*
one
of
the
moments
whose
series
will
go
to
make
up
their
sum
,
a
moment
*NL*
as
genuine
as
the
rest
,
if
not
actually
more
important
to
ourself
*NL*
because
our
mistress
is
more
intensely
a
part
of
it
;
we
picture
it
to
*NL*
ourselves
,
we
possess
it
,
we
intervene
upon
it
,
almost
we
have
created
*NL*
it
:
namely
,
the
moment
in
which
he
goes
to
tell
her
that
we
are
waiting
*NL*
there
below
.
And
very
probably
the
other
moments
of
the
party
will
not
*NL*
be
essentially
different
,
will
contain
nothing
else
so
exquisite
or
so
*NL*
well
able
to
make
us
suffer
,
since
this
kind
friend
has
assured
us
that
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
she
will
be
delighted
to
come
down
!
It
will
be
far
more
*NL*
amusing
for
her
to
talk
to
you
than
to
be
bored
up
there
.
''
Alas
!
Swann
*NL*
had
learned
by
experience
that
the
good
intentions
of
a
third
party
are
*NL*
powerless
to
control
a
woman
who
is
annoyed
to
find
herself
pursued
even
*NL*
into
a
ball-room
by
a
man
whom
she
does
not
love
.
Too
often
,
the
kind
*NL*
friend
comes
down
again
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
did
not
appear
,
but
with
no
attempt
to
safeguard
my
*NL*
self-respect
-LRB-
which
depended
upon
her
keeping
up
the
fiction
that
she
*NL*
had
asked
me
to
let
her
know
the
result
of
my
search
for
something
*NL*
or
other
-RRB-
made
Fran√ßoise
tell
me
,
in
so
many
words
``
There
is
no
*NL*
answer
''
--
words
I
have
so
often
,
since
then
,
heard
the
hall-porters
in
*NL*
`
mansions
'
and
the
flunkeys
in
gambling-clubs
and
the
like
,
repeat
to
*NL*
some
poor
girl
,
who
replies
in
bewilderment
:
``
What
!
he
's
said
nothing
?
*NL*
It
's
not
possible
.
You
did
give
him
my
letter
,
did
n't
you
?
Very
well
,
*NL*
I
shall
wait
a
little
longer
.
''
And
just
as
she
invariably
protests
that
*NL*
she
does
not
need
the
extra
gas
which
the
porter
offers
to
light
for
*NL*
her
,
and
sits
on
there
,
hearing
nothing
further
,
except
an
occasional
*NL*
remark
on
the
weather
which
the
porter
exchanges
with
a
messenger
*NL*
whom
he
will
send
off
suddenly
,
when
he
notices
the
time
,
to
put
some
*NL*
customer
's
wine
on
the
ice
;
so
,
having
declined
Fran√ßoise
's
offer
to
*NL*
make
me
some
tea
or
to
stay
beside
me
,
I
let
her
go
off
again
to
the
*NL*
servants
'
hall
,
and
lay
down
and
shut
my
eyes
,
and
tried
not
to
hear
the
*NL*
voices
of
my
family
who
were
drinking
their
coffee
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
a
few
seconds
I
realised
that
,
by
writing
that
line
to
Mamma
,
*NL*
by
approaching
--
at
the
risk
of
making
her
angry
--
so
near
to
her
that
I
*NL*
felt
I
could
reach
out
and
grasp
the
moment
in
which
I
should
see
her
*NL*
again
,
I
had
cut
myself
off
from
the
possibility
of
going
to
sleep
*NL*
until
I
actually
had
seen
her
,
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
more
and
more
*NL*
painfully
as
I
increased
my
agitation
by
ordering
myself
to
keep
calm
*NL*
and
to
acquiesce
in
my
ill-fortune
.
Then
,
suddenly
,
my
anxiety
subsided
,
*NL*
a
feeling
of
intense
happiness
coursed
through
me
,
as
when
a
strong
*NL*
medicine
begins
to
take
effect
and
one
's
pain
vanishes
:
I
had
formed
a
*NL*
resolution
to
abandon
all
attempts
to
go
to
sleep
without
seeing
Mamma
,
*NL*
and
had
decided
to
kiss
her
at
all
costs
,
even
with
the
certainty
of
*NL*
being
in
disgrace
with
her
for
long
afterwards
,
when
she
herself
came
*NL*
up
to
bed
.
The
tranquillity
which
followed
my
anguish
made
me
extremely
*NL*
alert
,
no
less
than
my
sense
of
expectation
,
my
thirst
for
and
my
fear
*NL*
of
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noiselessly
I
opened
the
window
and
sat
down
on
the
foot
of
my
bed
;
*NL*
hardly
daring
to
move
in
case
they
should
hear
me
from
below
.
Things
*NL*
outside
seemed
also
fixed
in
mute
expectation
,
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
*NL*
moonlight
which
,
duplicating
each
of
them
and
throwing
it
back
by
the
*NL*
extension
,
forwards
,
of
a
shadow
denser
and
more
concrete
than
its
*NL*
substance
,
had
made
the
whole
landscape
seem
at
once
thinner
and
longer
,
*NL*
like
a
map
which
,
after
being
folded
up
,
is
spread
out
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
What
had
to
move
--
a
leaf
of
the
chestnut-tree
,
for
instance
--
moved
.
But
*NL*
its
minute
shuddering
,
complete
,
finished
to
the
least
detail
and
with
*NL*
utmost
delicacy
of
gesture
,
made
no
discord
with
the
rest
of
the
scene
,
*NL*
and
yet
was
not
merged
in
it
,
remaining
clearly
outlined
.
Exposed
upon
*NL*
this
surface
of
silence
,
which
absorbed
nothing
from
them
,
the
most
*NL*
distant
sounds
,
those
which
must
have
come
from
gardens
at
the
far
end
*NL*
of
the
town
,
could
be
distinguished
with
such
exact
`
finish
'
that
the
*NL*
impression
they
gave
of
coming
from
a
distance
seemed
due
only
to
their
*NL*
`
pianissimo
'
execution
,
like
those
movements
on
muted
strings
so
well
*NL*
performed
by
the
orchestra
of
the
Conservatoire
that
,
although
one
does
*NL*
not
lose
a
single
note
,
one
thinks
all
the
same
that
they
are
being
*NL*
played
somewhere
outside
,
a
long
way
from
the
concert
hall
,
so
that
all
*NL*
the
old
subscribers
,
and
my
grandmother
's
sisters
too
,
when
Swann
had
*NL*
given
them
his
seats
,
used
to
strain
their
ears
as
if
they
had
caught
*NL*
the
distant
approach
of
an
army
on
the
march
,
which
had
not
yet
rounded
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
Tr√©vise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
well
aware
that
I
had
placed
myself
in
a
position
than
which
*NL*
none
could
be
counted
upon
to
involve
me
in
graver
consequences
at
my
*NL*
parents
'
hands
;
consequences
far
graver
,
indeed
,
than
a
stranger
would
*NL*
have
imagined
,
and
such
as
-LRB-
he
would
have
thought
-RRB-
could
follow
only
*NL*
some
really
shameful
fault
.
But
in
the
system
of
education
which
they
*NL*
had
given
me
faults
were
not
classified
in
the
same
order
as
in
that
of
*NL*
other
children
,
and
I
had
been
taught
to
place
at
the
head
of
the
list
*NL*
-LRB-
doubtless
because
there
was
no
other
class
of
faults
from
which
*NL*
I
needed
to
be
more
carefully
protected
-RRB-
those
in
which
I
can
now
*NL*
distinguish
the
common
feature
that
one
succumbs
to
them
by
yielding
to
*NL*
a
nervous
impulse
.
But
such
words
as
these
last
had
never
been
uttered
*NL*
in
my
hearing
;
no
one
had
yet
accounted
for
my
temptations
in
a
way
*NL*
which
might
have
led
me
to
believe
that
there
was
some
excuse
for
my
*NL*
giving
in
to
them
,
or
that
I
was
actually
incapable
of
holding
out
*NL*
against
them
.
Yet
I
could
easily
recognise
this
class
of
transgressions
*NL*
by
the
anguish
of
mind
which
preceded
,
as
well
as
by
the
rigour
of
the
*NL*
punishment
which
followed
them
;
and
I
knew
that
what
I
had
just
done
was
*NL*
in
the
same
category
as
certain
other
sins
for
which
I
had
been
severely
*NL*
chastised
,
though
infinitely
more
serious
than
they
.
When
I
went
out
to
*NL*
meet
my
mother
as
she
herself
came
up
to
bed
,
and
when
she
saw
that
I
*NL*
had
remained
up
so
as
to
say
good
night
to
her
again
in
the
passage
,
*NL*
I
should
not
be
allowed
to
stay
in
the
house
a
day
longer
,
I
should
be
*NL*
packed
off
to
school
next
morning
;
so
much
was
certain
.
Very
good
:
had
*NL*
I
been
obliged
,
the
next
moment
,
to
hurl
myself
out
of
the
window
,
*NL*
I
should
still
have
preferred
such
a
fate
.
For
what
I
wanted
now
was
*NL*
Mamma
,
and
to
say
good
night
to
her
.
I
had
gone
too
far
along
the
road
*NL*
which
led
to
the
realisation
of
this
desire
to
be
able
to
retrace
my
*NL*
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hear
my
parents
'
footsteps
as
they
went
with
Swann
;
and
,
when
*NL*
the
rattle
of
the
gate
assured
me
that
he
had
really
gone
,
I
crept
to
*NL*
the
window
.
Mamma
was
asking
my
father
if
he
had
thought
the
lobster
*NL*
good
,
and
whether
M.
Swann
had
had
some
of
the
coffee-and-pistachio
ice
.
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
rather
so-so
,
''
she
was
saying
;
``
next
time
we
shall
have
to
*NL*
try
another
flavour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
''
said
my
great-aunt
,
``
what
a
change
I
find
in
Swann
.
*NL*
He
is
quite
antiquated
!
''
She
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
seeing
Swann
*NL*
always
in
the
same
stage
of
adolescence
that
it
was
a
shock
to
her
to
*NL*
find
him
suddenly
less
young
than
the
age
she
still
attributed
to
him
.
*NL*
And
the
others
too
were
beginning
to
remark
in
Swann
that
abnormal
,
*NL*
excessive
,
scandalous
senescence
,
meet
only
in
a
celibate
,
in
one
of
*NL*
that
class
for
whom
it
seems
that
the
great
day
which
knows
no
morrow
*NL*
must
be
longer
than
for
other
men
,
since
for
such
a
one
it
is
void
of
*NL*
promise
,
and
from
its
dawn
the
moments
steadily
accumulate
without
any
*NL*
subsequent
partition
among
his
offspring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
he
has
a
lot
of
trouble
with
that
wretched
wife
of
his
,
who
*NL*
`
lives
'
with
a
certain
Monsieur
de
Charlus
,
as
all
Combray
knows
.
It
's
*NL*
the
talk
of
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
observed
that
,
in
spite
of
this
,
he
had
looked
much
less
*NL*
unhappy
of
late
.
``
And
he
does
n't
nearly
so
often
do
that
trick
of
his
,
*NL*
so
like
his
father
,
of
wiping
his
eyes
and
passing
his
hand
across
his
*NL*
forehead
.
I
think
myself
that
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
does
n't
love
his
*NL*
wife
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
he
does
n't
,
''
answered
my
grandfather
.
``
He
wrote
me
a
*NL*
letter
about
it
,
ages
ago
,
to
which
I
took
care
to
pay
no
attention
,
but
*NL*
it
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
feelings
,
let
alone
his
love
for
his
wife
.
*NL*
Hullo
!
you
two
;
you
never
thanked
him
for
the
Asti
!
''
he
went
on
,
turning
*NL*
to
his
sisters-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
we
never
thanked
him
?
I
think
,
between
you
and
me
,
that
I
put
it
*NL*
to
him
quite
neatly
,
''
replied
my
aunt
Flora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
managed
it
very
well
;
I
admired
you
for
it
,
''
said
my
aunt
*NL*
C√©line
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
did
it
very
prettily
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
liked
my
expression
about
`
nice
neighbours
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Do
you
call
that
thanking
him
?
''
shouted
my
grandfather
.
``
I
heard
*NL*
that
all
right
,
but
devil
take
me
if
I
guessed
it
was
meant
for
Swann
.
*NL*
You
may
be
quite
sure
he
never
noticed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
;
Swann
is
not
a
fool
.
I
am
positive
he
appreciated
the
*NL*
compliment
.
You
did
n't
expect
me
to
tell
him
the
number
of
bottles
,
or
*NL*
to
guess
what
he
paid
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
and
mother
were
left
alone
and
sat
down
for
a
moment
;
then
my
*NL*
father
said
:
``
Well
,
shall
we
go
up
to
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
wish
,
dear
,
though
I
do
n't
feel
in
the
least
like
sleeping
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
why
;
it
ca
n't
be
the
coffee-ice
--
it
was
n't
strong
enough
to
*NL*
keep
me
awake
like
this
.
But
I
see
a
light
in
the
servants
'
hall
:
poor
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
has
been
sitting
up
for
me
,
so
I
will
get
her
to
unhook
me
*NL*
while
you
go
and
undress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
opened
the
latticed
door
which
led
from
the
hall
to
the
*NL*
staircase
.
Presently
I
heard
her
coming
upstairs
to
close
her
window
.
I
*NL*
went
quietly
into
the
passage
;
my
heart
was
beating
so
violently
that
I
*NL*
could
hardly
move
,
but
at
least
it
was
throbbing
no
longer
with
anxiety
,
*NL*
but
with
terror
and
with
joy
.
I
saw
in
the
well
of
the
stair
a
light
*NL*
coming
upwards
,
from
Mamma
's
candle
.
Then
I
saw
Mamma
herself
:
I
threw
*NL*
myself
upon
her
.
For
an
instant
she
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
,
not
*NL*
realising
what
could
have
happened
.
Then
her
face
assumed
an
expression
*NL*
of
anger
.
She
said
not
a
single
word
to
me
;
and
,
for
that
matter
,
I
used
*NL*
to
go
for
days
on
end
without
being
spoken
to
,
for
far
less
offences
*NL*
than
this
.
A
single
word
from
Mamma
would
have
been
an
admission
that
*NL*
further
intercourse
with
me
was
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
,
*NL*
and
that
might
perhaps
have
appeared
to
me
more
terrible
still
,
as
*NL*
indicating
that
,
with
such
a
punishment
as
was
in
store
for
me
,
mere
*NL*
silence
,
and
even
anger
,
were
relatively
puerile
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
word
from
her
then
would
have
implied
the
false
calm
in
which
one
*NL*
converses
with
a
servant
to
whom
one
has
just
decided
to
give
notice
;
*NL*
the
kiss
one
bestows
on
a
son
who
is
being
packed
off
to
enlist
,
which
*NL*
would
have
been
denied
him
if
it
had
merely
been
a
matter
of
being
*NL*
angry
with
him
for
a
few
days
.
But
she
heard
my
father
coming
from
the
*NL*
dressing-room
,
where
he
had
gone
to
take
off
his
clothes
,
and
,
to
avoid
*NL*
the
`
scene
'
which
he
would
make
if
he
saw
me
,
she
said
,
in
a
voice
*NL*
half-stifled
by
her
anger
:
``
Run
away
at
once
.
Do
n't
let
your
father
see
*NL*
you
standing
there
like
a
crazy
jane
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
begged
her
again
to
``
Come
and
say
good
night
to
me
!
''
terrified
as
*NL*
I
saw
the
light
from
my
father
's
candle
already
creeping
up
the
wall
,
*NL*
but
also
making
use
of
his
approach
as
a
means
of
blackmail
,
in
the
hope
*NL*
that
my
mother
,
not
wishing
him
to
find
me
there
,
as
find
me
he
must
*NL*
if
she
continued
to
hold
out
,
would
give
in
to
me
,
and
say
:
``
Go
back
to
*NL*
your
room
.
I
will
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Too
late
:
my
father
was
upon
us
.
Instinctively
I
murmured
,
though
no
one
*NL*
heard
me
,
``
I
am
done
for
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
,
however
.
My
father
used
constantly
to
refuse
to
let
me
do
*NL*
things
which
were
quite
clearly
allowed
by
the
more
liberal
charters
*NL*
granted
me
by
my
mother
and
grandmother
,
because
he
paid
no
heed
to
*NL*
`
Principles
,
'
and
because
in
his
sight
there
were
no
such
things
as
*NL*
`
Rights
of
Man
.
'
For
some
quite
irrelevant
reason
,
or
for
no
reason
at
*NL*
all
,
he
would
at
the
last
moment
prevent
me
from
taking
some
particular
*NL*
walk
,
one
so
regular
and
so
consecrated
to
my
use
that
to
deprive
me
of
*NL*
it
was
a
clear
breach
of
faith
;
or
again
,
as
he
had
done
this
evening
,
*NL*
long
before
the
appointed
hour
he
would
snap
out
:
``
Run
along
up
to
*NL*
bed
now
;
no
excuses
!
''
But
then
again
,
simply
because
he
was
devoid
*NL*
of
principles
-LRB-
in
my
grandmother
's
sense
-RRB-
,
so
he
could
not
,
properly
*NL*
speaking
,
be
called
inexorable
.
He
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
with
an
air
*NL*
of
annoyance
and
surprise
,
and
then
when
Mamma
had
told
him
,
not
without
*NL*
some
embarrassment
,
what
had
happened
,
said
to
her
:
``
Go
along
with
him
,
*NL*
then
;
you
said
just
now
that
you
did
n't
feel
like
sleep
,
so
stay
in
his
*NL*
room
for
a
little
.
I
do
n't
need
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
dear
,
''
my
mother
answered
timidly
,
``
whether
or
not
I
feel
like
*NL*
sleep
is
not
the
point
;
we
must
not
make
the
child
accustomed
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
question
of
making
him
accustomed
,
''
said
my
father
,
with
*NL*
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
;
``
you
can
see
quite
well
that
the
child
is
*NL*
unhappy
.
After
all
,
we
are
n't
gaolers
.
You
'll
end
by
making
him
ill
,
*NL*
and
a
lot
of
good
that
will
do
.
There
are
two
beds
in
his
room
;
tell
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
to
make
up
the
big
one
for
you
,
and
stay
beside
him
for
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
night
.
I
'm
off
to
bed
,
anyhow
;
I
'm
not
nervous
like
you
.
*NL*
Good
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
for
me
to
thank
my
father
;
what
he
called
my
*NL*
sentimentality
would
have
exasperated
him
.
I
stood
there
,
not
daring
*NL*
to
move
;
he
was
still
confronting
us
,
an
immense
figure
in
his
white
*NL*
nightshirt
,
crowned
with
the
pink
and
violet
scarf
of
Indian
cashmere
*NL*
in
which
,
since
he
had
begun
to
suffer
from
neuralgia
,
he
used
to
tie
up
*NL*
his
head
,
standing
like
Abraham
in
the
engraving
after
Benozzo
Gozzoli
*NL*
which
M.
Swann
had
given
me
,
telling
Sarah
that
she
must
tear
herself
*NL*
away
from
Isaac
.
Many
years
have
passed
since
that
night
.
The
wall
of
*NL*
the
staircase
,
up
which
I
had
watched
the
light
of
his
candle
gradually
*NL*
climb
,
was
long
ago
demolished
.
And
in
myself
,
too
,
many
things
have
*NL*
perished
which
,
I
imagined
,
would
last
for
ever
,
and
new
structures
have
*NL*
arisen
,
giving
birth
to
new
sorrows
and
new
joys
which
in
those
days
*NL*
I
could
not
have
foreseen
,
just
as
now
the
old
are
difficult
of
*NL*
comprehension
.
It
is
a
long
time
,
too
,
since
my
father
has
been
able
*NL*
to
tell
Mamma
to
``
Go
with
the
child
.
''
Never
again
will
such
hours
be
*NL*
possible
for
me
.
But
of
late
I
have
been
increasingly
able
to
catch
,
if
*NL*
I
listen
attentively
,
the
sound
of
the
sobs
which
I
had
the
strength
to
*NL*
control
in
my
father
's
presence
,
and
which
broke
out
only
when
I
found
*NL*
myself
alone
with
Mamma
.
Actually
,
their
echo
has
never
ceased
:
it
is
*NL*
only
because
life
is
now
growing
more
and
more
quiet
round
about
me
that
*NL*
I
hear
them
afresh
,
like
those
convent
bells
which
are
so
effectively
*NL*
drowned
during
the
day
by
the
noises
of
the
streets
that
one
would
*NL*
suppose
them
to
have
been
stopped
for
ever
,
until
they
sound
out
again
*NL*
through
the
silent
evening
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mamma
spent
that
night
in
my
room
:
when
I
had
just
committed
a
sin
so
*NL*
deadly
that
I
was
waiting
to
be
banished
from
the
household
,
my
parents
*NL*
gave
me
a
far
greater
concession
than
I
should
ever
have
won
as
the
*NL*
reward
of
a
good
action
.
Even
at
the
moment
when
it
manifested
itself
in
*NL*
this
crowning
mercy
,
my
father
's
conduct
towards
me
was
still
somewhat
*NL*
arbitrary
,
and
regardless
of
my
deserts
,
as
was
characteristic
of
him
*NL*
and
due
to
the
fact
that
his
actions
were
generally
dictated
by
chance
*NL*
expediencies
rather
than
based
on
any
formal
plan
.
And
perhaps
even
what
*NL*
I
called
his
strictness
,
when
he
sent
me
off
to
bed
,
deserved
that
*NL*
title
less
,
really
,
than
my
mother
's
or
grandmother
's
attitude
,
for
his
*NL*
nature
,
which
in
some
respects
differed
more
than
theirs
from
my
own
,
*NL*
had
probably
prevented
him
from
guessing
,
until
then
,
how
wretched
I
was
*NL*
every
evening
,
a
thing
which
my
mother
and
grandmother
knew
well
;
but
*NL*
they
loved
me
enough
to
be
unwilling
to
spare
me
that
suffering
,
*NL*
which
they
hoped
to
teach
me
to
overcome
,
so
as
to
reduce
my
nervous
*NL*
sensibility
and
to
strengthen
my
will
.
As
for
my
father
,
whose
affection
*NL*
for
me
was
of
another
kind
,
I
doubt
if
he
would
have
shewn
so
much
*NL*
courage
,
for
as
soon
as
he
had
grasped
the
fact
that
I
was
unhappy
he
*NL*
had
said
to
my
mother
:
``
Go
and
comfort
him
.
''
Mamma
stayed
all
night
in
*NL*
my
room
,
and
it
seemed
that
she
did
not
wish
to
mar
by
recrimination
*NL*
those
hours
,
so
different
from
anything
that
I
had
had
a
right
to
*NL*
expect
;
for
when
Fran√ßoise
-LRB-
who
guessed
that
something
extraordinary
*NL*
must
have
happened
when
she
saw
Mamma
sitting
by
my
side
,
holding
my
*NL*
hand
and
letting
me
cry
unchecked
-RRB-
said
to
her
:
``
But
,
Madame
,
what
is
*NL*
little
Master
crying
for
?
''
she
replied
:
``
Why
,
Fran√ßoise
,
he
does
n't
know
*NL*
himself
:
it
is
his
nerves
.
Make
up
the
big
bed
for
me
quickly
and
then
*NL*
go
off
to
your
own
.
''
And
thus
for
the
first
time
my
unhappiness
was
*NL*
regarded
no
longer
as
a
fault
for
which
I
must
be
punished
,
but
as
*NL*
an
involuntary
evil
which
had
been
officially
recognised
a
nervous
*NL*
condition
for
which
I
was
in
no
way
responsible
:
I
had
the
consolation
*NL*
that
I
need
no
longer
mingle
apprehensive
scruples
with
the
bitterness
*NL*
of
my
tears
;
I
could
weep
henceforward
without
sin
.
I
felt
no
small
*NL*
degree
of
pride
,
either
,
in
Fran√ßoise
presence
at
this
return
to
humane
*NL*
conditions
which
,
not
an
hour
after
Mamma
had
refused
to
come
up
to
my
*NL*
room
and
had
sent
the
snubbing
message
that
I
was
to
go
to
sleep
,
raised
*NL*
me
to
the
dignity
of
a
grown-up
person
,
brought
me
of
a
sudden
to
a
sort
*NL*
of
puberty
of
sorrow
,
to
emancipation
from
tears
.
I
ought
then
to
have
*NL*
been
happy
;
I
was
not
.
It
struck
me
that
my
mother
had
just
made
a
first
*NL*
concession
which
must
have
been
painful
to
her
,
that
it
was
a
first
step
*NL*
down
from
the
ideal
she
had
formed
for
me
,
and
that
for
the
first
time
*NL*
she
,
with
all
her
courage
,
had
to
confess
herself
beaten
.
It
struck
*NL*
me
that
if
I
had
just
scored
a
victory
it
was
over
her
;
that
I
had
*NL*
succeeded
,
as
sickness
or
sorrow
or
age
might
have
succeeded
,
in
*NL*
relaxing
her
will
,
in
altering
her
judgment
;
that
this
evening
opened
*NL*
a
new
era
,
must
remain
a
black
date
in
the
calendar
.
And
if
I
had
dared
*NL*
now
,
I
should
have
said
to
Mamma
:
``
No
,
I
do
n't
want
you
;
you
must
n't
*NL*
sleep
here
.
''
But
I
was
conscious
of
the
practical
wisdom
,
of
what
*NL*
would
be
called
nowadays
the
realism
with
which
she
tempered
the
ardent
*NL*
idealism
of
my
grandmother
's
nature
,
and
I
knew
that
now
the
mischief
*NL*
was
done
she
would
prefer
to
let
me
enjoy
the
soothing
pleasure
of
*NL*
her
company
,
and
not
to
disturb
my
father
again
.
Certainly
my
mother
's
*NL*
beautiful
features
seemed
to
shine
again
with
youth
that
evening
,
as
she
*NL*
sat
gently
holding
my
hands
and
trying
to
check
my
tears
;
but
,
just
for
*NL*
that
reason
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
should
not
have
happened
;
her
*NL*
anger
would
have
been
less
difficult
to
endure
than
this
new
kindness
*NL*
which
my
childhood
had
not
known
;
I
felt
that
I
had
with
an
impious
and
*NL*
secret
finger
traced
a
first
wrinkle
upon
her
soul
and
made
the
first
*NL*
white
hair
shew
upon
her
head
.
This
thought
redoubled
my
sobs
,
and
then
*NL*
I
saw
that
Mamma
,
who
had
never
allowed
herself
to
go
to
any
length
*NL*
of
tenderness
with
me
,
was
suddenly
overcome
by
my
tears
and
had
to
*NL*
struggle
to
keep
back
her
own
.
Then
,
as
she
saw
that
I
had
noticed
*NL*
this
,
she
said
to
me
,
with
a
smile
:
``
Why
,
my
little
buttercup
,
my
little
*NL*
canary-boy
,
he
's
going
to
make
Mamma
as
silly
as
himself
if
this
goes
*NL*
on
.
Look
,
since
you
ca
n't
sleep
,
and
Mamma
ca
n't
either
,
we
must
n't
*NL*
go
on
in
this
stupid
way
;
we
must
do
something
;
I
'll
get
one
of
your
*NL*
books
.
''
But
I
had
none
there
.
``
Would
you
like
me
to
get
out
the
books
*NL*
now
that
your
grandmother
is
going
to
give
you
for
your
birthday
?
Just
*NL*
think
it
over
first
,
and
do
n't
be
disappointed
if
there
is
nothing
new
*NL*
for
you
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
only
too
delighted
,
and
Mamma
went
to
find
a
parcel
of
books
*NL*
in
which
I
could
not
distinguish
,
through
the
paper
in
which
it
was
*NL*
wrapped
,
any
more
than
its
squareness
and
size
,
but
which
,
even
at
this
*NL*
first
glimpse
,
brief
and
obscure
as
it
was
,
bade
fair
to
eclipse
already
*NL*
the
paint-box
of
last
New
Year
's
Day
and
the
silkworms
of
the
year
*NL*
before
.
It
contained
_
La
Mare
au
Diable
_
,
_
Fran√ßois
le
Champi
_
,
_
La
*NL*
Petite
Fadette
_
,
and
_
Les
Ma√Ætres
Sonneurs
_
.
My
grandmother
,
as
I
*NL*
learned
afterwards
,
had
at
first
chosen
Mussel
's
poems
,
a
volume
of
*NL*
Rousseau
,
and
_
Indiana
_
;
for
while
she
considered
light
reading
as
*NL*
unwholesome
as
sweets
and
cakes
,
she
did
not
reflect
that
the
strong
*NL*
breath
of
genius
must
have
upon
the
very
soul
of
a
child
an
influence
*NL*
at
once
more
dangerous
and
less
quickening
than
those
of
fresh
air
and
*NL*
country
breezes
upon
his
body
.
But
when
my
father
had
seemed
almost
to
*NL*
regard
her
as
insane
on
learning
the
names
of
the
books
she
proposed
*NL*
to
give
me
,
she
had
journeyed
back
by
herself
to
Jouy-le-Vicomte
to
*NL*
the
bookseller
's
,
so
that
there
should
be
no
fear
of
my
not
having
my
*NL*
present
in
time
-LRB-
it
was
a
burning
hot
day
,
and
she
had
come
home
so
*NL*
unwell
that
the
doctor
had
warned
my
mother
not
to
allow
her
again
*NL*
to
tire
herself
in
that
way
-RRB-
,
and
had
there
fallen
back
upon
the
four
*NL*
pastoral
novels
of
George
Sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
she
had
said
to
Mamma
,
``
I
could
not
allow
myself
to
give
the
*NL*
child
anything
that
was
not
well
written
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
was
that
she
could
never
make
up
her
mind
to
purchase
anything
*NL*
from
which
no
intellectual
profit
was
to
be
derived
,
and
,
above
all
,
*NL*
that
profit
which
good
things
bestowed
on
us
by
teaching
us
to
seek
our
*NL*
pleasures
elsewhere
than
in
the
barren
satisfaction
of
worldly
wealth
.
*NL*
Even
when
she
had
to
make
some
one
a
present
of
the
kind
called
*NL*
`
useful
,
'
when
she
had
to
give
an
armchair
or
some
table-silver
or
*NL*
a
walking-stick
,
she
would
choose
`
antiques
,
'
as
though
their
long
*NL*
desuetude
had
effaced
from
them
any
semblance
of
utility
and
fitted
*NL*
them
rather
to
instruct
us
in
the
lives
of
the
men
of
other
days
than
*NL*
to
serve
the
common
requirements
of
our
own
.
She
would
have
liked
me
to
*NL*
have
in
my
room
photographs
of
ancient
buildings
or
of
beautiful
places
.
*NL*
But
at
the
moment
of
buying
them
,
and
for
all
that
the
subject
of
the
*NL*
picture
had
an
aesthetic
value
of
its
own
,
she
would
find
that
vulgarity
*NL*
and
utility
had
too
prominent
a
part
in
them
,
through
the
mechanical
*NL*
nature
of
their
reproduction
by
photography
.
She
attempted
by
a
*NL*
subterfuge
,
if
not
to
eliminate
altogether
their
commercial
banality
,
*NL*
at
least
to
minimise
it
,
to
substitute
for
the
bulk
of
it
what
was
*NL*
art
still
,
to
introduce
,
as
it
might
be
,
several
`
thicknesses
'
of
*NL*
art
;
instead
of
photographs
of
Chartres
Cathedral
,
of
the
Fountains
*NL*
of
Saint-Cloud
,
or
of
Vesuvius
she
would
inquire
of
Swann
whether
some
*NL*
great
painter
had
not
made
pictures
of
them
,
and
preferred
to
give
me
*NL*
photographs
of
`
Chartres
Cathedral
'
after
Corot
,
of
the
`
Fountains
of
*NL*
Saint-Cloud
'
after
Hubert
Robert
,
and
of
`
Vesuvius
'
after
Turner
,
which
*NL*
were
a
stage
higher
in
the
scale
of
art
.
But
although
the
photographer
*NL*
had
been
prevented
from
reproducing
directly
the
masterpieces
or
the
*NL*
beauties
of
nature
,
and
had
there
been
replaced
by
a
great
artist
,
he
*NL*
resumed
his
odious
position
when
it
came
to
reproducing
the
artist
's
*NL*
interpretation
.
Accordingly
,
having
to
reckon
again
with
vulgarity
,
*NL*
my
grandmother
would
endeavour
to
postpone
the
moment
of
contact
still
*NL*
further
.
She
would
ask
Swann
if
the
picture
had
not
been
engraved
,
*NL*
preferring
,
when
possible
,
old
engravings
with
some
interest
of
*NL*
association
apart
from
themselves
,
such
,
for
example
,
as
shew
us
a
*NL*
masterpiece
in
a
state
in
which
we
can
no
longer
see
it
to-day
,
as
*NL*
Morghen
's
print
of
the
`
Cenacolo
'
of
Leonardo
before
it
was
spoiled
*NL*
by
restoration
.
It
must
be
admitted
that
the
results
of
this
method
of
*NL*
interpreting
the
art
of
making
presents
were
not
always
happy
.
The
idea
*NL*
which
I
formed
of
Venice
,
from
a
drawing
by
Titian
which
is
supposed
to
*NL*
have
the
lagoon
in
the
background
,
was
certainly
far
less
accurate
than
*NL*
what
I
have
since
derived
from
ordinary
photographs
.
We
could
no
*NL*
longer
keep
count
in
the
family
-LRB-
when
my
great-aunt
tried
to
frame
an
*NL*
indictment
of
my
grandmother
-RRB-
of
all
the
armchairs
she
had
presented
*NL*
to
married
couples
,
young
and
old
,
which
on
a
first
attempt
to
sit
down
*NL*
upon
them
had
at
once
collapsed
beneath
the
weight
of
their
recipient
.
*NL*
But
my
grandmother
would
have
thought
it
sordid
to
concern
herself
too
*NL*
closely
with
the
solidity
of
any
piece
of
furniture
in
which
could
still
*NL*
be
discerned
a
flourish
,
a
smile
,
a
brave
conceit
of
the
past
.
And
*NL*
even
what
in
such
pieces
supplied
a
material
need
,
since
it
did
so
in
a
*NL*
manner
to
which
we
are
no
longer
accustomed
,
was
as
charming
to
her
as
*NL*
one
of
those
old
forms
of
speech
in
which
we
can
still
see
traces
of
a
*NL*
metaphor
whose
fine
point
has
been
worn
away
by
the
rough
usage
of
our
*NL*
modern
tongue
.
In
precisely
the
same
way
the
pastoral
novels
of
George
*NL*
Sand
,
which
she
was
giving
me
for
my
birthday
,
were
regular
lumber-rooms
*NL*
of
antique
furniture
,
full
of
expressions
that
have
fallen
out
of
use
*NL*
and
returned
as
imagery
,
such
as
one
finds
now
only
in
country
dialects
.
*NL*
And
my
grandmother
had
bought
them
in
preference
to
other
books
,
just
as
*NL*
she
would
have
preferred
to
take
a
house
that
had
a
gothic
dovecot
,
or
*NL*
some
other
such
piece
of
antiquity
as
would
have
a
pleasant
effect
on
*NL*
the
mind
,
filling
it
with
a
nostalgic
longing
for
impossible
journeys
*NL*
through
the
realms
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mamma
sat
down
by
my
bed
;
she
had
chosen
_
Fran√ßois
le
Champi
_
,
whose
*NL*
reddish
cover
and
incomprehensible
title
gave
it
a
distinct
personality
*NL*
in
my
eyes
and
a
mysterious
attraction
.
I
had
not
then
read
any
real
*NL*
novels
.
I
had
heard
it
said
that
George
Sand
was
a
typical
novelist
.
*NL*
That
prepared
me
in
advance
to
imagine
that
_
Fran√ßois
le
Champi
_
*NL*
contained
something
inexpressibly
delicious
.
The
course
of
the
*NL*
narrative
,
where
it
tended
to
arouse
curiosity
or
melt
to
pity
,
certain
*NL*
modes
of
expression
which
disturb
or
sadden
the
reader
,
and
which
,
with
*NL*
a
little
experience
,
he
may
recognise
as
`
common
form
'
in
novels
,
seemed
*NL*
to
me
then
distinctive
--
for
to
me
a
new
book
was
not
one
of
a
number
of
*NL*
similar
objects
,
but
was
like
an
individual
man
,
unmatched
,
and
with
no
*NL*
cause
of
existence
beyond
himself
--
an
intoxicating
whiff
of
the
peculiar
*NL*
essence
of
_
Fran√ßois
le
Champi
_
.
Beneath
the
everyday
incidents
,
the
*NL*
commonplace
thoughts
and
hackneyed
words
,
I
could
hear
,
or
overhear
,
an
*NL*
intonation
,
a
rhythmic
utterance
fine
and
strange
.
The
`
action
'
began
:
*NL*
to
me
it
seemed
all
the
more
obscure
because
in
those
days
,
when
I
read
*NL*
to
myself
,
I
used
often
,
while
I
turned
the
pages
,
to
dream
of
something
*NL*
quite
different
.
And
to
the
gaps
which
this
habit
made
in
my
knowledge
*NL*
of
the
story
more
were
added
by
the
fact
that
when
it
was
Mamma
who
was
*NL*
reading
to
me
aloud
she
left
all
the
love-scenes
out
.
And
so
all
the
odd
*NL*
changes
which
take
place
in
the
relations
between
the
miller
's
wife
and
*NL*
the
boy
,
changes
which
only
the
birth
and
growth
of
love
can
explain
,
*NL*
seemed
to
me
plunged
and
steeped
in
a
mystery
,
the
key
to
which
-LRB-
as
I
*NL*
could
readily
believe
-RRB-
lay
in
that
strange
and
pleasant-sounding
name
of
*NL*
_
Champi
_
,
which
draped
the
boy
who
bore
it
,
I
knew
not
why
,
in
its
own
*NL*
bright
colour
,
purpurate
and
charming
.
If
my
mother
was
not
a
faithful
*NL*
reader
,
she
was
,
none
the
less
,
admirable
when
reading
a
work
in
which
*NL*
she
found
the
note
of
true
feeling
by
the
respectful
simplicity
of
her
*NL*
interpretation
and
by
the
sound
of
her
sweet
and
gentle
voice
.
It
was
*NL*
the
same
in
her
daily
life
,
when
it
was
not
works
of
art
but
men
and
*NL*
women
whom
she
was
moved
to
pity
or
admire
:
it
was
touching
to
observe
*NL*
with
what
deference
she
would
banish
from
her
voice
,
her
gestures
,
from
*NL*
her
whole
conversation
,
now
the
note
of
joy
which
might
have
distressed
*NL*
some
mother
who
had
long
ago
lost
a
child
,
now
the
recollection
of
an
*NL*
event
or
anniversary
which
might
have
reminded
some
old
gentleman
of
the
*NL*
burden
of
his
years
,
now
the
household
topic
which
might
have
bored
some
*NL*
young
man
of
letters
.
And
so
,
when
she
read
aloud
the
prose
of
George
*NL*
Sand
,
prose
which
is
everywhere
redolent
of
that
generosity
and
moral
*NL*
distinction
which
Mamma
had
learned
from
my
grandmother
to
place
above
*NL*
all
other
qualities
in
life
,
and
which
I
was
not
to
teach
her
until
*NL*
much
later
to
refrain
from
placing
,
in
the
same
way
,
above
all
other
*NL*
qualities
in
literature
;
taking
pains
to
banish
from
her
voice
any
*NL*
weakness
or
affectation
which
might
have
blocked
its
channel
for
that
*NL*
powerful
stream
of
language
,
she
supplied
all
the
natural
tenderness
,
*NL*
all
the
lavish
sweetness
which
they
demanded
to
phrases
which
seemed
*NL*
to
have
been
composed
for
her
voice
,
and
which
were
all
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
within
her
compass
.
She
came
to
them
with
the
tone
that
they
required
,
*NL*
with
the
cordial
accent
which
existed
before
they
were
,
which
dictated
*NL*
them
,
but
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
words
themselves
,
and
by
these
*NL*
means
she
smoothed
away
,
as
she
read
on
,
any
harshness
there
might
be
*NL*
or
discordance
in
the
tenses
of
verbs
,
endowing
the
imperfect
and
the
*NL*
preterite
with
all
the
sweetness
which
there
is
in
generosity
,
all
the
*NL*
melancholy
which
there
is
in
love
;
guided
the
sentence
that
was
drawing
*NL*
to
an
end
towards
that
which
was
waiting
to
begin
,
now
hastening
,
now
*NL*
slackening
the
pace
of
the
syllables
so
as
to
bring
them
,
despite
their
*NL*
difference
of
quantity
,
into
a
uniform
rhythm
,
and
breathed
into
this
*NL*
quite
ordinary
prose
a
kind
of
life
,
continuous
and
full
of
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
agony
was
soothed
;
I
let
myself
be
borne
upon
the
current
of
this
*NL*
gentle
night
on
which
I
had
my
mother
by
my
side
.
I
knew
that
such
a
*NL*
night
could
not
be
repeated
;
that
the
strongest
desire
I
had
in
the
*NL*
world
,
namely
,
to
keep
my
mother
in
my
room
through
the
sad
hours
of
*NL*
darkness
,
ran
too
much
counter
to
general
requirements
and
to
the
wishes
*NL*
of
others
for
such
a
concession
as
had
been
granted
me
this
evening
to
*NL*
be
anything
but
a
rare
and
casual
exception
.
To-morrow
night
I
should
*NL*
again
be
the
victim
of
anguish
and
Mamma
would
not
stay
by
my
side
.
But
*NL*
when
these
storms
of
anguish
grew
calm
I
could
no
longer
realise
*NL*
their
existence
;
besides
,
tomorrow
evening
was
still
a
long
way
off
;
*NL*
I
reminded
myself
that
I
should
still
have
time
to
think
about
things
,
*NL*
albeit
that
remission
of
time
could
bring
me
no
access
of
power
,
albeit
*NL*
the
coming
event
was
in
no
way
dependent
upon
the
exercise
of
my
will
,
*NL*
and
seemed
not
quite
inevitable
only
because
it
was
still
separated
from
*NL*
me
by
this
short
interval
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
was
that
,
for
a
long
time
afterwards
,
when
I
lay
awake
at
*NL*
night
and
revived
old
memories
of
Combray
,
I
saw
no
more
of
it
than
*NL*
this
sort
of
luminous
panel
,
sharply
defined
against
a
vague
and
shadowy
*NL*
background
,
like
the
panels
which
a
Bengal
fire
or
some
electric
sign
*NL*
will
illuminate
and
dissect
from
the
front
of
a
building
the
other
*NL*
parts
of
which
remain
plunged
in
darkness
:
broad
enough
at
its
base
,
the
*NL*
little
parlour
,
the
dining-room
,
the
alluring
shadows
of
the
path
along
*NL*
which
would
come
M.
Swann
,
the
unconscious
author
of
my
sufferings
,
the
*NL*
hall
through
which
I
would
journey
to
the
first
step
of
that
staircase
,
*NL*
so
hard
to
climb
,
which
constituted
,
all
by
itself
,
the
tapering
*NL*
`
elevation
'
of
an
irregular
pyramid
;
and
,
at
the
summit
,
my
bedroom
,
*NL*
with
the
little
passage
through
whose
glazed
door
Mamma
would
enter
;
*NL*
in
a
word
,
seen
always
at
the
same
evening
hour
,
isolated
from
all
*NL*
its
possible
surroundings
,
detached
and
solitary
against
its
shadowy
*NL*
background
,
the
bare
minimum
of
scenery
necessary
-LRB-
like
the
setting
*NL*
one
sees
printed
at
the
head
of
an
old
play
,
for
its
performance
in
*NL*
the
provinces
-RRB-
to
the
drama
of
my
undressing
,
as
though
all
Combray
had
*NL*
consisted
of
but
two
floors
joined
by
a
slender
staircase
,
and
as
though
*NL*
there
had
been
no
time
there
but
seven
o'clock
at
night
.
I
must
own
*NL*
that
I
could
have
assured
any
questioner
that
Combray
did
include
other
*NL*
scenes
and
did
exist
at
other
hours
than
these
.
But
since
the
facts
*NL*
which
I
should
then
have
recalled
would
have
been
prompted
only
by
an
*NL*
exercise
of
the
will
,
by
my
intellectual
memory
,
and
since
the
pictures
*NL*
which
that
kind
of
memory
shews
us
of
the
past
preserve
nothing
of
*NL*
the
past
itself
,
I
should
never
have
had
any
wish
to
ponder
over
this
*NL*
residue
of
Combray
.
To
me
it
was
in
reality
all
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Permanently
dead
?
Very
possibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
large
element
of
hazard
in
these
matters
,
and
a
second
*NL*
hazard
,
that
of
our
own
death
,
often
prevents
us
from
awaiting
for
any
*NL*
length
of
time
the
favours
of
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
feel
that
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
the
Celtic
belief
that
the
*NL*
souls
of
those
whom
we
have
lost
are
held
captive
in
some
inferior
*NL*
being
,
in
an
animal
,
in
a
plant
,
in
some
inanimate
object
,
and
so
*NL*
effectively
lost
to
us
until
the
day
-LRB-
which
to
many
never
comes
-RRB-
when
we
*NL*
happen
to
pass
by
the
tree
or
to
obtain
possession
of
the
object
which
*NL*
forms
their
prison
.
Then
they
start
and
tremble
,
they
call
us
by
our
*NL*
name
,
and
as
soon
as
we
have
recognised
their
voice
the
spell
is
broken
.
*NL*
We
have
delivered
them
:
they
have
overcome
death
and
return
to
share
our
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
is
with
our
own
past
.
It
is
a
labour
in
vain
to
attempt
to
*NL*
recapture
it
:
all
the
efforts
of
our
intellect
must
prove
futile
.
*NL*
The
past
is
hidden
somewhere
outside
the
realm
,
beyond
the
reach
of
*NL*
intellect
,
in
some
material
object
-LRB-
in
the
sensation
which
that
material
*NL*
object
will
give
us
-RRB-
which
we
do
not
suspect
.
And
as
for
that
object
,
*NL*
it
depends
on
chance
whether
we
come
upon
it
or
not
before
we
ourselves
*NL*
must
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
years
had
elapsed
during
which
nothing
of
Combray
,
save
what
was
*NL*
comprised
in
the
theatre
and
the
drama
of
my
going
to
bed
there
,
had
*NL*
any
existence
for
me
,
when
one
day
in
winter
,
as
I
came
home
,
my
*NL*
mother
,
seeing
that
I
was
cold
,
offered
me
some
tea
,
a
thing
I
did
*NL*
not
ordinarily
take
.
I
declined
at
first
,
and
then
,
for
no
particular
*NL*
reason
,
changed
my
mind
.
She
sent
out
for
one
of
those
short
,
plump
*NL*
little
cakes
called
`
petites
madeleines
,
'
which
look
as
though
they
*NL*
had
been
moulded
in
the
fluted
scallop
of
a
pilgrim
's
shell
.
And
soon
,
*NL*
mechanically
,
weary
after
a
dull
day
with
the
prospect
of
a
depressing
*NL*
morrow
,
I
raised
to
my
lips
a
spoonful
of
the
tea
in
which
I
had
soaked
*NL*
a
morsel
of
the
cake
.
No
sooner
had
the
warm
liquid
,
and
the
crumbs
with
*NL*
it
,
touched
my
palate
than
a
shudder
ran
through
my
whole
body
,
and
I
*NL*
stopped
,
intent
upon
the
extraordinary
changes
that
were
taking
place
.
*NL*
An
exquisite
pleasure
had
invaded
my
senses
,
but
individual
,
detached
,
*NL*
with
no
suggestion
of
its
origin
.
And
at
once
the
vicissitudes
of
life
*NL*
had
become
indifferent
to
me
,
its
disasters
innocuous
,
its
brevity
*NL*
illusory
--
this
new
sensation
having
had
on
me
the
effect
which
love
has
*NL*
of
filling
me
with
a
precious
essence
;
or
rather
this
essence
was
not
*NL*
in
me
,
it
was
myself
.
I
had
ceased
now
to
feel
mediocre
,
accidental
,
*NL*
mortal
.
Whence
could
it
have
come
to
me
,
this
all-powerful
joy
?
I
was
*NL*
conscious
that
it
was
connected
with
the
taste
of
tea
and
cake
,
but
that
*NL*
it
infinitely
transcended
those
savours
,
could
not
,
indeed
,
be
of
the
*NL*
same
nature
as
theirs
.
Whence
did
it
come
?
What
did
it
signify
?
How
*NL*
could
I
seize
upon
and
define
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
drink
a
second
mouthful
,
in
which
I
find
nothing
more
than
in
the
*NL*
first
,
a
third
,
which
gives
me
rather
less
than
the
second
.
It
is
time
*NL*
to
stop
;
the
potion
is
losing
its
magic
.
It
is
plain
that
the
object
*NL*
of
my
quest
,
the
truth
,
lies
not
in
the
cup
but
in
myself
.
The
tea
has
*NL*
called
up
in
me
,
but
does
not
itself
understand
,
and
can
only
repeat
*NL*
indefinitely
with
a
gradual
loss
of
strength
,
the
same
testimony
;
which
*NL*
I
,
too
,
can
not
interpret
,
though
I
hope
at
least
to
be
able
to
call
upon
*NL*
the
tea
for
it
again
and
to
find
it
there
presently
,
intact
and
at
my
*NL*
disposal
,
for
my
final
enlightenment
.
I
put
down
my
cup
and
examine
my
*NL*
own
mind
.
It
is
for
it
to
discover
the
truth
.
But
how
?
What
an
abyss
*NL*
of
uncertainty
whenever
the
mind
feels
that
some
part
of
it
has
strayed
*NL*
beyond
its
own
borders
;
when
it
,
the
seeker
,
is
at
once
the
dark
region
*NL*
through
which
it
must
go
seeking
,
where
all
its
equipment
will
avail
it
*NL*
nothing
.
Seek
?
More
than
that
:
create
.
It
is
face
to
face
with
something
*NL*
which
does
not
so
far
exist
,
to
which
it
alone
can
give
reality
and
*NL*
substance
,
which
it
alone
can
bring
into
the
light
of
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
begin
again
to
ask
myself
what
it
could
have
been
,
this
*NL*
unremembered
state
which
brought
with
it
no
logical
proof
of
its
*NL*
existence
,
but
only
the
sense
that
it
was
a
happy
,
that
it
was
a
*NL*
real
state
in
whose
presence
other
states
of
consciousness
melted
and
*NL*
vanished
.
I
decide
to
attempt
to
make
it
reappear
.
I
retrace
my
thoughts
*NL*
to
the
moment
at
which
I
drank
the
first
spoonful
of
tea
.
I
find
again
*NL*
the
same
state
,
illumined
by
no
fresh
light
.
I
compel
my
mind
to
make
*NL*
one
further
effort
,
to
follow
and
recapture
once
again
the
fleeting
*NL*
sensation
.
And
that
nothing
may
interrupt
it
in
its
course
I
shut
out
*NL*
every
obstacle
,
every
extraneous
idea
,
I
stop
my
ears
and
inhibit
all
*NL*
attention
to
the
sounds
which
come
from
the
next
room
.
And
then
,
feeling
*NL*
that
my
mind
is
growing
fatigued
without
having
any
success
to
report
,
*NL*
I
compel
it
for
a
change
to
enjoy
that
distraction
which
I
have
just
*NL*
denied
it
,
to
think
of
other
things
,
to
rest
and
refresh
itself
before
*NL*
the
supreme
attempt
.
And
then
for
the
second
time
I
clear
an
empty
*NL*
space
in
front
of
it
.
I
place
in
position
before
my
mind
's
eye
the
still
*NL*
recent
taste
of
that
first
mouthful
,
and
I
feel
something
start
within
*NL*
me
,
something
that
leaves
its
resting-place
and
attempts
to
rise
,
*NL*
something
that
has
been
embedded
like
an
anchor
at
a
great
depth
;
I
*NL*
do
not
know
yet
what
it
is
,
but
I
can
feel
it
mounting
slowly
;
I
can
*NL*
measure
the
resistance
,
I
can
hear
the
echo
of
great
spaces
traversed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Undoubtedly
what
is
thus
palpitating
in
the
depths
of
my
being
must
*NL*
be
the
image
,
the
visual
memory
which
,
being
linked
to
that
taste
,
has
*NL*
tried
to
follow
it
into
my
conscious
mind
.
But
its
struggles
are
too
*NL*
far
off
,
too
much
confused
;
scarcely
can
I
perceive
the
colourless
*NL*
reflection
in
which
are
blended
the
uncapturable
whirling
medley
of
*NL*
radiant
hues
,
and
I
can
not
distinguish
its
form
,
can
not
invite
it
,
as
*NL*
the
one
possible
interpreter
,
to
translate
to
me
the
evidence
of
its
*NL*
contemporary
,
its
inseparable
paramour
,
the
taste
of
cake
soaked
in
tea
;
*NL*
can
not
ask
it
to
inform
me
what
special
circumstance
is
in
question
,
of
*NL*
what
period
in
my
past
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
it
ultimately
reach
the
clear
surface
of
my
consciousness
,
this
*NL*
memory
,
this
old
,
dead
moment
which
the
magnetism
of
an
identical
moment
*NL*
has
travelled
so
far
to
importune
,
to
disturb
,
to
raise
up
out
of
the
*NL*
very
depths
of
my
being
?
I
can
not
tell
.
Now
that
I
feel
nothing
,
it
has
*NL*
stopped
,
has
perhaps
gone
down
again
into
its
darkness
,
from
which
who
*NL*
can
say
whether
it
will
ever
rise
?
Ten
times
over
I
must
essay
the
task
,
*NL*
must
lean
down
over
the
abyss
.
And
each
time
the
natural
laziness
which
*NL*
deters
us
from
every
difficult
enterprise
,
every
work
of
importance
,
has
*NL*
urged
me
to
leave
the
thing
alone
,
to
drink
my
tea
and
to
think
merely
*NL*
of
the
worries
of
to-day
and
of
my
hopes
for
to-morrow
,
which
let
*NL*
themselves
be
pondered
over
without
effort
or
distress
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
the
memory
returns
.
The
taste
was
that
of
the
little
crumb
*NL*
of
madeleine
which
on
Sunday
mornings
at
Combray
-LRB-
because
on
those
*NL*
mornings
I
did
not
go
out
before
church-time
-RRB-
,
when
I
went
to
say
good
*NL*
day
to
her
in
her
bedroom
,
my
aunt
L√©onie
used
to
give
me
,
dipping
it
*NL*
first
in
her
own
cup
of
real
or
of
lime-flower
tea
.
The
sight
of
the
*NL*
little
madeleine
had
recalled
nothing
to
my
mind
before
I
tasted
it
;
*NL*
perhaps
because
I
had
so
often
seen
such
things
in
the
interval
,
without
*NL*
tasting
them
,
on
the
trays
in
pastry-cooks
'
windows
,
that
their
image
*NL*
had
dissociated
itself
from
those
Combray
days
to
take
its
place
among
*NL*
others
more
recent
;
perhaps
because
of
those
memories
,
so
long
abandoned
*NL*
and
put
out
of
mind
,
nothing
now
survived
,
everything
was
scattered
;
the
*NL*
forms
of
things
,
including
that
of
the
little
scallop-shell
of
pastry
,
*NL*
so
richly
sensual
under
its
severe
,
religious
folds
,
were
either
*NL*
obliterated
or
had
been
so
long
dormant
as
to
have
lost
the
power
of
*NL*
expansion
which
would
have
allowed
them
to
resume
their
place
in
my
*NL*
consciousness
.
But
when
from
a
long-distant
past
nothing
subsists
,
after
*NL*
the
people
are
dead
,
after
the
things
are
broken
and
scattered
,
still
,
*NL*
alone
,
more
fragile
,
but
with
more
vitality
,
more
unsubstantial
,
more
*NL*
persistent
,
more
faithful
,
the
smell
and
taste
of
things
remain
poised
a
*NL*
long
time
,
like
souls
,
ready
to
remind
us
,
waiting
and
hoping
for
their
*NL*
moment
,
amid
the
ruins
of
all
the
rest
;
and
bear
unfaltering
,
in
the
*NL*
tiny
and
almost
impalpable
drop
of
their
essence
,
the
vast
structure
of
*NL*
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
once
I
had
recognized
the
taste
of
the
crumb
of
madeleine
soaked
in
*NL*
her
decoction
of
lime-flowers
which
my
aunt
used
to
give
me
-LRB-
although
I
*NL*
did
not
yet
know
and
must
long
postpone
the
discovery
of
why
this
memory
*NL*
made
me
so
happy
-RRB-
immediately
the
old
grey
house
upon
the
street
,
where
*NL*
her
room
was
,
rose
up
like
the
scenery
of
a
theatre
to
attach
itself
to
*NL*
the
little
pavilion
,
opening
on
to
the
garden
,
which
had
been
built
out
*NL*
behind
it
for
my
parents
-LRB-
the
isolated
panel
which
until
that
moment
had
*NL*
been
all
that
I
could
see
-RRB-
;
and
with
the
house
the
town
,
from
morning
to
*NL*
night
and
in
all
weathers
,
the
Square
where
I
was
sent
before
luncheon
,
*NL*
the
streets
along
which
I
used
to
run
errands
,
the
country
roads
we
took
*NL*
when
it
was
fine
.
And
just
as
the
Japanese
amuse
themselves
by
filling
*NL*
a
porcelain
bowl
with
water
and
steeping
in
it
little
crumbs
of
paper
*NL*
which
until
then
are
without
character
or
form
,
but
,
the
moment
they
*NL*
become
wet
,
stretch
themselves
and
bend
,
take
on
colour
and
distinctive
*NL*
shape
,
become
flowers
or
houses
or
people
,
permanent
and
recognisable
,
*NL*
so
in
that
moment
all
the
flowers
in
our
garden
and
in
M.
Swann
's
park
,
*NL*
and
the
water-lilies
on
the
Vivonne
and
the
good
folk
of
the
village
and
*NL*
their
little
dwellings
and
the
parish
church
and
the
whole
of
Combray
*NL*
and
of
its
surroundings
,
taking
their
proper
shapes
and
growing
solid
,
*NL*
sprang
into
being
,
town
and
gardens
alike
,
from
my
cup
of
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
COMBRAY
*NL*
*NL*
Combray
at
a
distance
,
from
a
twenty-mile
radius
,
as
we
used
to
see
it
*NL*
from
the
railway
when
we
arrived
there
every
year
in
Holy
Week
,
was
no
*NL*
more
than
a
church
epitomising
the
town
,
representing
it
,
speaking
of
it
*NL*
and
for
it
to
the
horizon
,
and
as
one
drew
near
,
gathering
close
about
*NL*
its
long
,
dark
cloak
,
sheltering
from
the
wind
,
on
the
open
plain
,
as
*NL*
a
shepherd
gathers
his
sheep
,
the
woolly
grey
backs
of
its
flocking
*NL*
houses
,
which
a
fragment
of
its
mediaeval
ramparts
enclosed
,
here
and
*NL*
there
,
in
an
outline
as
scrupulously
circular
as
that
of
a
little
town
*NL*
in
a
primitive
painting
.
To
live
in
,
Combray
was
a
trifle
depressing
,
*NL*
like
its
streets
,
whose
houses
,
built
of
the
blackened
stone
of
the
*NL*
country
,
fronted
with
outside
steps
,
capped
with
gables
which
projected
*NL*
long
shadows
downwards
,
were
so
dark
that
one
had
,
as
soon
as
the
sun
*NL*
began
to
go
down
,
to
draw
back
the
curtains
in
the
sitting-room
windows
;
*NL*
streets
with
the
solemn
names
of
Saints
,
not
a
few
of
whom
figured
*NL*
in
the
history
of
the
early
lords
of
Combray
,
such
as
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Hilaire
,
the
Rue
Saint-Jacques
,
in
which
my
aunt
's
house
stood
,
*NL*
the
Rue
Sainte-Hildegarde
,
which
ran
past
her
railings
,
and
the
Rue
*NL*
du
Saint-Esprit
,
on
to
which
the
little
garden
gate
opened
;
and
these
*NL*
Combray
streets
exist
in
so
remote
a
quarter
of
my
memory
,
painted
in
*NL*
colours
so
different
from
those
in
which
the
world
is
decked
for
me
*NL*
to-day
,
that
in
fact
one
and
all
of
them
,
and
the
church
which
towered
*NL*
above
them
in
the
Square
,
seem
to
me
now
more
unsubstantial
than
the
*NL*
projections
of
my
magic-lantern
;
while
at
times
I
feel
that
to
be
able
*NL*
to
cross
the
Rue
Saint-Hilaire
again
,
to
engage
a
room
in
the
Rue
de
*NL*
l'Oiseau
,
in
the
old
hostelry
of
the
Oiseau
Flesch√©
,
from
whose
windows
*NL*
in
the
pavement
used
to
rise
a
smell
of
cooking
which
rises
still
in
*NL*
my
mind
,
now
and
then
,
in
the
same
warm
gusts
of
comfort
,
would
be
to
*NL*
secure
a
contact
with
the
unseen
world
more
marvellously
supernatural
*NL*
than
it
would
be
to
make
Golo
's
acquaintance
and
to
chat
with
Genevi√®ve
*NL*
de
Brabant
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandfather
's
cousin
--
by
courtesy
my
great-aunt
--
with
whom
we
used
*NL*
to
stay
,
was
the
mother
of
that
aunt
L√©onie
who
,
since
her
husband
's
-LRB-
my
*NL*
uncle
Octave
's
-RRB-
death
,
had
gradually
declined
to
leave
,
first
Combray
,
*NL*
then
her
house
in
Combray
,
then
her
bedroom
,
and
finally
her
bed
;
*NL*
and
who
now
never
`
came
down
,
'
but
lay
perpetually
in
an
indefinite
*NL*
condition
of
grief
,
physical
exhaustion
,
illness
,
obsessions
,
*NL*
and
religious
observances
.
Her
own
room
looked
out
over
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Jacques
,
which
ran
a
long
way
further
to
end
in
the
Grand-Pr√©
-LRB-
as
*NL*
distinct
from
the
Petit-Pr√©
,
a
green
space
in
the
centre
of
the
town
*NL*
where
three
streets
met
-RRB-
and
which
,
monotonous
and
grey
,
with
the
three
*NL*
high
steps
of
stone
before
almost
every
one
of
its
doors
,
seemed
like
a
*NL*
deep
furrow
cut
by
some
sculptor
of
gothic
images
in
the
very
block
of
*NL*
stone
out
of
which
he
had
fashioned
a
Calvary
or
a
Crib
.
My
aunt
's
life
*NL*
was
now
practically
confined
to
two
adjoining
rooms
,
in
one
of
which
she
*NL*
would
rest
in
the
afternoon
while
they
,
aired
the
other
.
They
were
rooms
*NL*
of
that
country
order
which
-LRB-
just
as
in
certain
climes
whole
tracts
of
*NL*
air
or
ocean
are
illuminated
or
scented
by
myriads
of
protozoa
which
*NL*
we
can
not
see
-RRB-
fascinate
our
sense
of
smell
with
the
countless
odours
*NL*
springing
from
their
own
special
virtues
,
wisdom
,
habits
,
a
whole
secret
*NL*
system
of
life
,
invisible
,
superabundant
and
profoundly
moral
,
which
*NL*
their
atmosphere
holds
in
solution
;
smells
natural
enough
indeed
,
and
*NL*
coloured
by
circumstances
as
are
those
of
the
neighbouring
countryside
,
*NL*
but
already
humanised
,
domesticated
,
confined
,
an
exquisite
,
skilful
,
*NL*
limpid
jelly
,
blending
all
the
fruits
of
the
season
which
have
left
*NL*
the
orchard
for
the
store-room
,
smells
changing
with
the
year
,
but
*NL*
plenishing
,
domestic
smells
,
which
compensate
for
the
sharpness
of
hoar
*NL*
frost
with
the
sweet
savour
of
warm
bread
,
smells
lazy
and
punctual
as
*NL*
a
village
clock
,
roving
smells
,
pious
smells
;
rejoicing
in
a
peace
which
*NL*
brings
only
an
increase
of
anxiety
,
and
in
a
prosiness
which
serves
as
*NL*
a
deep
source
of
poetry
to
the
stranger
who
passes
through
their
midst
*NL*
without
having
lived
amongst
them
.
The
air
of
those
rooms
was
saturated
*NL*
with
the
fine
bouquet
of
a
silence
so
nourishing
,
so
succulent
that
I
*NL*
could
not
enter
them
without
a
sort
of
greedy
enjoyment
,
particularly
on
*NL*
those
first
mornings
,
chilly
still
,
of
the
Easter
holidays
,
when
I
could
*NL*
taste
it
more
fully
,
because
I
had
just
arrived
then
at
Combray
:
before
*NL*
I
went
in
to
wish
my
aunt
good
day
I
would
be
kept
waiting
a
little
time
*NL*
in
the
outer
room
,
where
the
sun
,
a
wintry
sun
still
,
had
crept
in
to
*NL*
warm
itself
before
the
fire
,
lighted
already
between
its
two
brick
sides
*NL*
and
plastering
all
the
room
and
everything
in
it
with
a
smell
of
soot
,
*NL*
making
the
room
like
one
of
those
great
open
hearths
which
one
finds
in
*NL*
the
country
,
or
one
of
the
canopied
mantelpieces
in
old
castles
under
*NL*
which
one
sits
hoping
that
in
the
world
outside
it
is
raining
or
*NL*
snowing
,
hoping
almost
for
a
catastrophic
deluge
to
add
the
romance
of
*NL*
shelter
and
security
to
the
comfort
of
a
snug
retreat
;
I
would
turn
to
*NL*
and
fro
between
the
prayer-desk
and
the
stamped
velvet
armchairs
,
each
*NL*
one
always
draped
in
its
crocheted
antimacassar
,
while
the
fire
,
baking
*NL*
like
a
pie
the
appetising
smells
with
which
the
air
of
the
room
,
was
*NL*
thickly
clotted
,
which
the
dewy
and
sunny
freshness
of
the
morning
had
*NL*
already
`
raised
'
and
started
to
`
set
,
'
puffed
them
and
glazed
them
and
*NL*
fluted
them
and
swelled
them
into
an
invisible
though
not
impalpable
*NL*
country
cake
,
an
immense
puff-pastry
,
in
which
,
barely
waiting
to
savour
*NL*
the
crustier
,
more
delicate
,
more
respectable
,
but
also
drier
smells
*NL*
of
the
cupboard
,
the
chest-of-drawers
,
and
the
patterned
wall-paper
*NL*
I
always
returned
with
an
unconfessed
gluttony
to
bury
myself
in
the
*NL*
nondescript
,
resinous
,
dull
,
indigestible
,
and
fruity
smell
of
the
*NL*
flowered
quilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
next
room
I
could
hear
my
aunt
talking
quietly
to
herself
.
She
*NL*
never
spoke
save
in
low
tones
,
because
she
believed
that
there
was
*NL*
something
broken
in
her
head
and
floating
loose
there
,
which
she
might
*NL*
displace
by
talking
too
loud
;
but
she
never
remained
for
long
,
even
when
*NL*
alone
,
without
saying
something
,
because
she
believed
that
it
was
good
*NL*
for
her
throat
,
and
that
by
keeping
the
blood
there
in
circulation
it
*NL*
would
make
less
frequent
the
chokings
and
other
pains
to
which
she
*NL*
was
liable
;
besides
,
in
the
life
of
complete
inertia
which
she
led
she
*NL*
attached
to
the
least
of
her
sensations
an
extraordinary
importance
,
*NL*
endowed
them
with
a
Protean
ubiquity
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
*NL*
keep
them
secret
,
and
,
failing
a
confidant
to
whom
she
might
communicate
*NL*
them
,
she
used
to
promulgate
them
to
herself
in
an
unceasing
monologue
*NL*
which
was
her
sole
form
of
activity
.
Unfortunately
,
having
formed
the
*NL*
habit
of
thinking
aloud
,
she
did
not
always
take
care
to
see
that
there
*NL*
was
no
one
in
the
adjoining
room
,
and
I
would
often
hear
her
saying
*NL*
to
herself
:
``
I
must
not
forget
that
I
never
slept
a
wink
''
--
for
``
never
*NL*
sleeping
a
wink
''
was
her
great
claim
to
distinction
,
and
one
admitted
*NL*
and
respected
in
our
household
vocabulary
;
in
the
morning
Fran√ßoise
*NL*
would
not
`
call
'
her
,
but
would
simply
`
come
to
'
her
;
during
the
day
,
*NL*
when
my
aunt
wished
to
take
a
nap
,
we
used
to
say
just
that
she
wished
*NL*
to
`
be
quiet
'
or
to
`
rest
'
;
and
when
in
conversation
she
so
far
forgot
*NL*
herself
as
to
say
``
what
made
me
wake
up
,
''
or
``
I
dreamed
that
,
''
she
would
*NL*
flush
and
at
once
correct
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
waiting
a
minute
,
I
would
go
in
and
kiss
her
;
Fran√ßoise
would
*NL*
be
making
her
tea
;
or
,
if
my
aunt
were
feeling
`
upset
,
'
she
would
ask
*NL*
instead
for
her
't
isane
,
'
and
it
would
be
my
duty
to
shake
out
of
*NL*
the
chemist
's
little
package
on
to
a
plate
the
amount
of
lime-blossom
*NL*
required
for
infusion
in
boiling
water
.
The
drying
of
the
stems
had
*NL*
twisted
them
into
a
fantastic
trellis
,
in
whose
intervals
the
pale
*NL*
flowers
opened
,
as
though
a
painter
had
arranged
them
there
,
grouping
*NL*
them
in
the
most
decorative
poses
.
The
leaves
,
which
had
lost
or
altered
*NL*
their
own
appearance
,
assumed
those
instead
of
the
most
incongruous
*NL*
things
imaginable
,
as
though
the
transparent
wings
of
flies
or
the
blank
*NL*
sides
of
labels
or
the
petals
of
roses
had
been
collected
and
pounded
,
*NL*
or
interwoven
as
birds
weave
the
material
for
their
nests
.
A
*NL*
thousand
trifling
little
details
--
the
charming
prodigality
of
the
*NL*
chemist
--
details
which
would
have
been
eliminated
from
an
artificial
*NL*
preparation
,
gave
me
,
like
a
book
in
which
one
is
astonished
to
read
the
*NL*
name
of
a
person
whom
one
knows
,
the
pleasure
of
finding
that
these
were
*NL*
indeed
real
lime-blossoms
,
like
those
I
had
seen
,
when
coming
from
the
*NL*
train
,
in
the
Avenue
de
la
Gare
,
altered
,
but
only
because
they
were
not
*NL*
imitations
but
the
very
same
blossoms
,
which
had
grown
old
.
And
as
each
*NL*
new
character
is
merely
a
metamorphosis
from
something
older
,
in
these
*NL*
little
grey
balls
I
recognised
green
buds
plucked
before
their
time
;
but
*NL*
beyond
all
else
the
rosy
,
moony
,
tender
glow
which
lit
up
the
blossoms
*NL*
among
the
frail
forest
of
stems
from
which
they
hung
like
little
golden
*NL*
roses
--
marking
,
as
the
radiance
upon
an
old
wall
still
marks
the
place
*NL*
of
a
vanished
fresco
,
the
difference
between
those
parts
of
the
tree
*NL*
which
had
and
those
which
had
not
been
`
in
bloom
'
--
shewed
me
that
these
*NL*
were
petals
which
,
before
their
flowering-time
,
the
chemist
's
package
*NL*
had
embalmed
on
warm
evenings
of
spring
.
That
rosy
candlelight
was
still
*NL*
their
colour
,
but
half-extinguished
and
deadened
in
the
diminished
life
*NL*
which
was
now
theirs
,
and
which
may
be
called
the
twilight
of
a
flower
.
*NL*
Presently
my
aunt
was
able
to
dip
in
the
boiling
infusion
,
in
which
she
*NL*
would
relish
the
savour
of
dead
or
faded
blossom
,
a
little
madeleine
,
of
*NL*
which
she
would
hold
out
a
piece
to
me
when
it
was
sufficiently
soft
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
side
of
her
bed
stood
a
big
yellow
chest-of-drawers
of
*NL*
lemon-wood
,
and
a
table
which
served
at
once
as
pharmacy
and
as
*NL*
high
altar
,
on
which
,
beneath
a
statue
of
Our
Lady
and
a
bottle
of
*NL*
Vichy-C√©lestins
,
might
be
found
her
service-books
and
her
medical
*NL*
prescriptions
,
everything
that
she
needed
for
the
performance
,
in
bed
,
*NL*
of
her
duties
to
soul
and
body
,
to
keep
the
proper
times
for
pepsin
and
*NL*
for
vespers
.
On
the
other
side
her
bed
was
bounded
by
the
window
:
she
*NL*
had
the
street
beneath
her
eyes
,
and
would
read
in
it
from
morning
to
*NL*
night
to
divert
the
tedium
of
her
life
,
like
a
Persian
prince
,
the
daily
*NL*
but
immemorial
chronicles
of
Combray
,
which
she
would
discuss
in
detail
*NL*
afterwards
with
Fran√ßoise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
have
been
five
minutes
with
my
aunt
before
she
would
send
me
*NL*
away
in
case
I
made
her
tired
.
She
would
hold
out
for
me
to
kiss
her
sad
*NL*
brow
,
pale
and
lifeless
,
on
which
at
this
early
hour
she
would
not
yet
*NL*
have
arranged
the
false
hair
and
through
which
the
bones
shone
like
the
*NL*
points
of
a
crown
of
thorns
--
or
the
beads
of
a
rosary
,
and
she
would
say
*NL*
to
me
:
``
Now
,
my
poor
child
,
you
must
go
away
;
go
and
get
ready
for
*NL*
mass
;
and
if
you
see
Fran√ßoise
downstairs
,
tell
her
not
to
stay
too
*NL*
long
amusing
herself
with
you
;
she
must
come
up
soon
to
see
if
I
want
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
,
who
had
been
for
many
years
in
my
aunt
's
service
and
did
not
*NL*
at
that
time
suspect
that
she
would
one
day
be
transferred
entirely
to
*NL*
ours
,
was
a
little
inclined
to
desert
my
aunt
during
the
months
which
we
*NL*
spent
in
her
house
.
There
had
been
in
my
infancy
,
before
we
first
went
*NL*
to
Combray
,
and
when
my
aunt
L√©onie
used
still
to
spend
the
winter
in
*NL*
Paris
with
her
mother
,
a
time
when
I
knew
Fran√ßoise
so
little
that
on
*NL*
New
Year
's
Day
,
before
going
into
my
great-aunt
's
house
,
my
mother
put
*NL*
a
five-franc
piece
in
my
hand
and
said
:
``
Now
,
be
careful
.
Do
n't
make
*NL*
any
mistake
.
Wait
until
you
hear
me
say
`
Good
morning
,
Fran√ßoise
,
'
and
*NL*
I
touch
your
arm
before
you
give
it
to
her
.
''
No
sooner
had
we
arrived
*NL*
in
my
aunt
's
dark
hall
than
we
saw
in
the
gloom
,
beneath
the
frills
of
a
*NL*
snowy
cap
as
stiff
and
fragile
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
spun
sugar
,
the
*NL*
concentric
waves
of
a
smile
of
anticipatory
gratitude
.
It
was
Fran√ßoise
,
*NL*
motionless
and
erect
,
framed
in
the
small
doorway
of
the
corridor
like
*NL*
the
statue
of
a
saint
in
its
niche
.
When
we
had
grown
more
accustomed
to
*NL*
this
religious
darkness
we
could
discern
in
her
features
a
disinterested
*NL*
love
of
all
humanity
,
blended
with
a
tender
respect
for
the
`
upper
*NL*
classes
'
which
raised
to
the
most
honourable
quarter
of
her
heart
the
*NL*
hope
of
receiving
her
due
reward
.
Mamma
pinched
my
arm
sharply
and
said
*NL*
in
a
loud
voice
:
``
Good
morning
,
Fran√ßoise
.
''
At
this
signal
my
fingers
*NL*
parted
and
I
let
fall
the
coin
,
which
found
a
receptacle
in
a
confused
*NL*
but
outstretched
hand
.
But
since
we
had
begun
to
go
to
Combray
there
was
*NL*
no
one
I
knew
better
than
Fran√ßoise
.
We
were
her
favourites
,
and
in
the
*NL*
first
years
at
least
,
while
she
shewed
the
same
consideration
for
us
*NL*
as
for
my
aunt
,
she
enjoyed
us
with
a
keener
relish
,
because
we
had
,
in
*NL*
addition
to
our
dignity
as
part
of
`
the
family
'
-LRB-
for
she
had
for
those
*NL*
invisible
bonds
by
which
community
of
blood
unites
the
members
of
a
*NL*
family
as
much
respect
as
any
Greek
tragedian
-RRB-
,
the
fresh
charm
of
not
*NL*
being
her
customary
employers
.
And
so
with
what
joy
would
she
welcome
*NL*
us
,
with
what
sorrow
complain
that
the
weather
was
still
so
bad
for
us
,
*NL*
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
,
just
before
Easter
,
when
there
was
often
an
*NL*
icy
wind
;
while
Mamma
inquired
after
her
daughter
and
her
nephews
,
and
*NL*
if
her
grandson
was
good-looking
,
and
what
they
were
going
to
make
of
*NL*
him
,
and
whether
he
took
after
his
granny
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
,
when
no
one
else
was
in
the
room
,
Mamma
,
who
knew
that
Fran√ßoise
*NL*
was
still
mourning
for
her
parents
,
who
had
been
dead
for
years
,
would
*NL*
speak
of
them
kindly
,
asking
her
endless
little
questions
about
them
and
*NL*
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
guessed
that
Fran√ßoise
was
not
over-fond
of
her
son-in-law
,
and
*NL*
that
he
spoiled
the
pleasure
she
found
in
visiting
her
daughter
,
as
the
*NL*
two
could
not
talk
so
freely
when
he
was
there
.
And
so
one
day
,
when
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
was
going
to
their
house
,
some
miles
from
Combray
,
Mamma
said
*NL*
to
her
,
with
a
smile
:
``
Tell
me
,
Fran√ßoise
,
if
Julien
has
had
to
go
away
,
*NL*
and
you
have
Marguerite
to
yourself
all
day
,
you
will
be
very
sorry
,
but
*NL*
will
make
the
best
of
it
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Fran√ßoise
answered
,
laughing
:
``
Madame
knows
everything
;
Madame
*NL*
is
worse
than
the
X-rays
''
-LRB-
she
pronounced
`
x
'
with
an
affectation
*NL*
of
difficulty
and
with
a
smile
in
deprecation
of
her
,
an
unlettered
*NL*
woman
's
,
daring
to
employ
a
scientific
term
-RRB-
``
they
brought
here
for
Mme.
*NL*
Octave
,
which
see
what
is
in
your
heart
''
--
and
she
went
off
,
disturbed
*NL*
that
anyone
should
be
caring
about
her
,
perhaps
anxious
that
we
should
*NL*
not
see
her
in
tears
:
Mamma
was
the
first
person
who
had
given
her
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
feeling
that
her
peasant
existence
,
with
its
simple
joys
*NL*
and
sorrows
,
might
offer
some
interest
,
might
be
a
source
of
grief
or
*NL*
pleasure
to
some
one
other
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
resigned
herself
to
doing
without
Fran√ßoise
to
some
extent
*NL*
during
our
visits
,
knowing
how
much
my
mother
appreciated
the
services
*NL*
of
so
active
and
intelligent
a
maid
,
one
who
looked
as
smart
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
her
kitchen
,
under
a
cap
whose
stiff
and
*NL*
dazzling
frills
seemed
to
be
made
of
porcelain
,
as
when
dressed
for
*NL*
churchgoing
;
who
did
everything
in
the
right
way
,
who
toiled
like
a
*NL*
horse
,
whether
she
was
well
or
ill
,
but
without
noise
,
without
the
*NL*
appearance
of
doing
anything
;
the
only
one
of
my
aunt
's
maids
who
when
*NL*
Mamma
asked
for
hot
water
or
black
coffee
would
bring
them
actually
*NL*
boiling
;
she
was
one
of
those
servants
who
in
a
household
seem
least
*NL*
satisfactory
,
at
first
,
to
a
stranger
,
doubtless
because
they
take
*NL*
no
pains
to
make
a
conquest
of
him
and
shew
him
no
special
attention
,
*NL*
knowing
very
well
that
they
have
no
real
need
of
him
,
that
he
will
cease
*NL*
to
be
invited
to
the
house
sooner
than
they
will
be
dismissed
from
it
;
*NL*
who
,
on
the
other
hand
,
cling
with
most
fidelity
to
those
masters
and
*NL*
mistresses
who
have
tested
and
proved
their
real
capacity
,
and
do
not
*NL*
look
for
that
superficial
responsiveness
,
that
slavish
affability
,
*NL*
which
may
impress
a
stranger
favourably
,
but
often
conceals
an
utter
*NL*
barrenness
of
spirit
in
which
no
amount
of
training
can
produce
the
*NL*
least
trace
of
individuality
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Fran√ßoise
,
having
seen
that
my
parents
had
everything
they
*NL*
required
,
first
went
upstairs
again
to
give
my
aunt
her
pepsin
and
to
*NL*
find
out
from
her
what
she
would
take
for
luncheon
,
very
few
mornings
*NL*
pased
but
she
was
called
upon
to
give
an
opinion
,
or
to
furnish
an
*NL*
explanation
,
in
regard
to
some
important
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
fancy
,
Fran√ßoise
,
Mme.
Goupil
went
by
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
late
to
fetch
her
sister
:
if
she
loses
any
more
time
on
the
way
I
*NL*
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
she
got
in
after
the
Elevation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
'd
be
nothing
wonderful
in
that
,
''
would
be
the
answer
.
Or
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fran√ßoise
,
if
you
had
come
in
five
minutes
ago
,
you
would
have
seen
*NL*
Mme.
Imbert
go
past
with
some
asparagus
twice
the
size
of
what
mother
*NL*
Callot
has
:
do
try
to
find
out
from
her
cook
where
she
got
them
.
You
*NL*
know
you
've
been
putting
asparagus
in
all
your
sauces
this
spring
;
you
*NL*
might
be
able
to
get
some
like
these
for
our
visitors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
be
surprised
if
they
came
from
the
Cur√©
's
,
''
Fran√ßoise
would
*NL*
say
,
and
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
would
n't
,
my
poor
Fran√ßoise
,
''
my
aunt
would
reply
,
raising
*NL*
her
shoulders
.
``
From
the
Cur√©
's
,
indeed
!
You
know
quite
well
that
he
*NL*
can
never
grow
anything
but
wretched
little
twigs
of
asparagus
,
not
*NL*
asparagus
at
all
.
I
tell
you
these
ones
were
as
thick
as
my
arm
.
Not
*NL*
your
arm
,
of
course
,
but
my-poor
arm
,
which
has
grown
so
much
thinner
*NL*
again
this
year
.
''
Or
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fran√ßoise
,
did
n't
you
hear
that
bell
just
now
!
It
split
my
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mme.
Octave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
poor
girl
,
your
skull
must
be
very
thick
;
you
may
thank
God
for
*NL*
that
.
It
was
Maguelone
come
to
fetch
Dr.
Piperaud
.
He
came
out
with
her
*NL*
at
once
and
they
went
off
along
the
Rue
de
l'Oiseau
.
There
must
be
some
*NL*
child
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
dear
;
the
poor
little
creature
!
''
would
come
with
a
sigh
from
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
,
who
could
not
hear
of
any
calamity
befalling
a
person
unknown
*NL*
to
her
,
even
in
some
distant
part
of
the
world
,
without
beginning
to
*NL*
lament
.
Or
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fran√ßoise
,
for
whom
did
they
toll
the
passing-bell
just
now
?
Oh
dear
,
*NL*
of
course
,
it
would
be
for
Mme.
Rousseau
.
And
to
think
that
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
that
she
passed
away
the
other
night
.
Indeed
,
it
is
time
the
*NL*
Lord
called
me
home
too
;
I
do
n't
know
what
has
become
of
my
head
since
I
*NL*
lost
my
poor
Octave
.
But
I
am
wasting
your
time
,
my
good
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
no
,
Mme.
Octave
,
my
time
is
not
so
precious
;
whoever
made
our
*NL*
time
did
n't
sell
it
to
us
.
I
am
just
going
to
see
that
my
fire
has
n't
*NL*
gone
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
Fran√ßoise
and
my
aunt
made
a
critical
valuation
between
*NL*
them
,
in
the
course
of
these
morning
sessions
,
of
the
earliest
*NL*
happenings
of
the
day
.
But
sometimes
these
happenings
assumed
so
*NL*
mysterious
or
so
alarming
an
air
that
my
aunt
felt
she
could
not
wait
*NL*
until
it
was
time
for
Fran√ßoise
to
come
upstairs
,
and
then
a
formidable
*NL*
and
quadruple
peal
would
resound
through
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Mme.
Octave
,
it
is
not
time
for
your
pepsin
,
''
Fran√ßoise
would
*NL*
begin
.
``
Are
you
feeling
faint
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
Fran√ßoise
,
''
my
aunt
would
reply
,
``
that
is
to
say
,
yes
;
*NL*
for
you
know
well
that
there
is
very
seldom
a
time
when
I
do
n't
feel
*NL*
faint
;
one
day
I
shall
pass
away
like
Mme.
Rousseau
,
before
I
know
where
*NL*
I
am
;
but
that
is
not
why
I
rang
.
Would
you
believe
that
I
have
just
*NL*
seen
,
as
plainly
as
I
see
you
,
Mme.
Goupil
with
a
little
girl
I
did
n't
*NL*
know
at
all
.
Run
and
get
a
pennyworth
of
salt
from
Camus
.
It
's
not
often
*NL*
that
Th√©odore
ca
n't
tell
you
who
a
person
is
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
must
be
M.
Pupin
's
daughter

''
Fran√ßoise
would
say
,
preferring
*NL*
to
stick
to
an
immediate
explanation
,
since
she
had
been
perhaps
twice
*NL*
already
into
Camus
's
shop
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Pupin
's
daughter

Oh

my
poor
Fran√ßoise

*NL*
you
think
I
should
not
have
recognised
M.
Pupin

daughter

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't

little

*NL*
one
who
goes
to
school
at
Jouy

I
seem
to
have
seen
her
once
already
his
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
that
's
what
it
is

my
aunt
would
say

``
she
must
have
come
over

Yes

that
is
it

No
need
to
ask

she
will
have
come
*NL*
over
for
the
holidays

But
then
we
shall
soon
see
Mme.
Sazerat
come
*NL*
along
and
ring
her
sister
's
door-bell
,
for
her
luncheon
.
That
will
be
*NL*
it
!
I
saw
the
boy
from
Galopin
's
go
by
with
a
tart
.
You
will
see
that

the
tart
was
for

*NL*

Once

their
luncheon
there

*NL*
not
so
early
as
it
was

would
be
the
answer
,
for
Fran√ßoise
,
who
was
*NL*
anxious
to
retire
downstairs
to
look
after
our
own
meal
,
was
not
sorry
*NL*
to
leave
my
aunt
with
the
prospect
of
such
a
distraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
not
before
midday
!
''
my
aunt
would
reply
in
a
tone
of
resignation
,
*NL*
darting
an
uneasy
glance
at
the
clock
,
but
stealthily
,
so
as
not
to
let
*NL*
it
be
seen
that
she
,
who
had
renounced
all
earthly
joys
,
yet
found
a
*NL*
keen
satisfaction
in
learning
that
Mme.
Goupil
was
expecting
company
to
*NL*
luncheon
,
though
,
alas
,
she
must
wait
a
little
more
than
an
hour
still
*NL*
before
enjoying
the
spectacle
.
``
And
it
will
come
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
my
luncheon
!

she
would
murmur
to
herself
.
Her
luncheon
was
such
a
*NL*
distraction
in
itself
that
she
did
not
like
any
other
to
come
at
the
*NL*
same
time
.
``
At

,
you
will
not
forget
to
give
me
my
creamed
eggs

*NL*
one
of
the
flat
plates

''
These
were
the
only
plates
which
had
pictures
*NL*
on
them
and
my
aunt
used
to
amuse
herself
at
every
meal
by
reading
the
*NL*
description
on
whichever
might
have
been
sent
up
to
her
.
She
would
*NL*
put
on
her
spectacles
and
spell
out
:
``
Ali
Baba
and
the
Forty
Thieves
,
''
*NL*
``
Aladdin
,
or
the
Wonderful
Lamp
,

and
smile
,
and
say
``
Very
good
indeed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
as
well
go
across
to
Camus
...

Fran√ßoise
would
hazard
,
seeing
*NL*
that
my
aunt
had
no
longer
any
intention
of
sending
her
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

not
worth

certain
to
be
the

My
*NL*
poor
Fran√ßoise
,
I
am
sorry
to
have
made
you
come
upstairs
for
nothing

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
for
nothing
,
as
my
aunt
well
knew
,
that
she
had
rung
for
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
,
since
at
Combray
a
person
whom
one
`
did
n't
know
at
all
'
was
*NL*
as
incredible
a
being
as
any
mythological
deity
,
and
it
was
apt
to
be
*NL*
forgotten
that
after
each
occasion
on
which
there
had
appeared
in
the
*NL*
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
or
in
the
Square
one
of
these
bewildering
phenomena
,
*NL*
careful
and
exhaustive
researches
had
invariably
reduced
the
fabulous
*NL*
monster
to
the
proportions
of
a
person
whom
one
`
did
know
,
'
either
*NL*
personally
or
in
the
abstract
,
in
his
or
her
civil
status
as
being
more
*NL*
or
less
closely
related
to
some
family
in
Combray
.
It
would
turn
out
to
*NL*
be
Mme.
Sauton
's
son
discharged
from
the
army
,
or
the
Abb√©
Perdreau
's
*NL*
niece
come
home
from
her
convent
,
or
the
Cur√©
's
brother
,
a
tax-collector
*NL*
at
Ch√¢teaudun
,
who
had
just
retired
on
a
pension
or
had
come
over
to
*NL*
Combray
for
the
holidays
.
On
first
noticing
them
you
have
been
impressed
*NL*
by
the
thought
that
there
might
be
in
Combray
people
whom
you
`
did
n't
*NL*
know
at
all
,
'
simply
because
,
you
had
failed
to
recognise
or
identify
*NL*
them
at
once
.
And
yet
long
beforehand
Mme.
Sauton
and
the
Cur√©
had
given
*NL*
warning
that
they
expected
their
`
strangers
.
'
In
the
evening
,
when
I
*NL*
came
in
and
went
upstairs
to
tell
my
aunt
the
incidents
of
our
walk
,
if
*NL*
I
was
rash
enough
to
say
to
her
that
we
had
passed
,
near
the
Pont-Vieux
,
*NL*
a
man
whom
my
grandfather
did
n't
know
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
grandfather
did
n't
know
at
all
!
''
she
would
exclaim
.
``
That
's
a
*NL*
likely
story
.
''
None
the
less
,
she
would
be
a
little
disturbed
by
*NL*
the
news
,
she
would
wish
to
have
the
details
correctly
,
and
so
my
*NL*
grandfather
would
be
summoned
.
``
Who
can
it
have
been
that
you
passed
*NL*
near
the
Pont-Vieux
,
uncle
?
A
man
you
did
n't
know
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
I
did
,
''
my
grandfather
would
answer
;
``
it
was
Prosper
,
*NL*
Mme.
Bouilleboeuf
's
gardener
's
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
!
''
my
aunt
would
say
,
calm
again
but
slightly
flushed
still
;
*NL*
``
and
the
boy
told
me
that
you
had
passed
a
man
you
did
n't
know
at
all
!
''
*NL*
After
which
I
would
be
warned
to
be
more
careful
of
what
I
said
,
and
not
*NL*
to
upset
my
aunt
so
by
thoughtless
remarks
.
Everyone
was
so
well
known
*NL*
in
Combray
,
animals
as
well
as
people
,
that
if
my
aunt
had
happened
to
*NL*
see
a
dog
go
by
which
she
`
did
n't
know
at
all
'
she
would
think
about
it
*NL*
incessantly
,
devoting
to
the
solution
of
the
incomprehensible
problem
*NL*
all
her
inductive
talent
and
her
leisure
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
be
Mme.
Sazerat
's
dog
,
''
Fran√ßoise
would
suggest
,
without
any
*NL*
real
conviction
,
but
in
the
hope
of
peace
,
and
so
that
my
aunt
should
*NL*
not
`
split
her
head
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
I
did
n't
know
Mme.
Sazerat
's
dog
!
''
--
for
my
aunt
's
critical
mind
*NL*
would
not
so
easily
admit
any
fresh
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
that
will
be
the
new
dog
M.
Galopin
has
brought
her
from
*NL*
Lisieux
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
that
's
what
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
,
it
's
a
most
engaging
animal
,
''
Fran√ßoise
would
go
on
,
having
*NL*
got
the
story
from
Th√©odore
,
``
as
clever
as
a
Christian
,
always
in
a
good
*NL*
temper
,
always
friendly
,
always
everything
that
's
nice
.
It
's
not
often
*NL*
you
see
an
animal
so
well-behaved
at
that
age
.
Mme.
Octave
,
it
's
high
*NL*
time
I
left
you
;
I
ca
n't
afford
to
stay
here
amusing
myself
;
look
,
it
's
*NL*
nearly
ten
o'clock
and
my
fire
not
lighted
yet
,
and
I
've
still
to
dress
*NL*
the
asparagus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Fran√ßoise
,
more
asparagus
!
It
's
a
regular
disease
of
asparagus
*NL*
you
have
got
this
year
:
you
will
make
our
Parisians
sick
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Madame
Octave
,
they
like
it
well
enough
.
They
'll
be
coming
back
*NL*
from
church
soon
as
hungry
as
hunters
,
and
they
wo
n't
eat
it
out
of
the
*NL*
back
of
their
spoons
,
you
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Church
!
why
,
they
must
be
there
now
;
you
'd
better
not
lose
any
time

Go
*NL*
and
look
after
your
luncheon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
my
aunt
gossiped
on
in
this
way
with
Fran√ßoise
I
would
have
*NL*
accompanied
my
parents
to
mass
.
How
I
loved
it
:
how
clearly
I
can
see
it
*NL*
still
,
our
church
at
Combray
!
The
old
porch
by
which
we
went
in
,
black
,
*NL*
and
full
of
holes
as
a
cullender
,
was
worn
out
of
shape
and
deeply
*NL*
furrowed
at
the
sides
-LRB-
as
also
was
the
holy
water
stoup
to
which
it
led
*NL*
us
-RRB-
just
as
if
the
gentle
grazing
touch
of
the
cloaks
of
peasant-women
*NL*
going
into
the
church
,
and
of
their
fingers
dipping
into
the
water
,
had
*NL*
managed
by
agelong
repetition
to
acquire
a
destructive
force
,
to
impress
*NL*
itself
on
the
stone
,
to
carve
ruts
in
it
like
those
made
by
cart-wheels
*NL*
upon
stone
gate-posts
against
which
they
are
driven
every
day
.
Its
*NL*
memorial
stones
,
beneath
which
the
noble
dust
of
the
Abbots
of
Combray
,
*NL*
who
were
buried
there
,
furnished
the
choir
with
a
sort
of
spiritual
*NL*
pavement
,
were
themselves
no
longer
hard
and
lifeless
matter
,
for
time
*NL*
had
softened
and
sweetened
them
,
and
had
made
them
melt
like
honey
*NL*
and
flow
beyond
their
proper
margins
,
either
surging
out
in
a
milky
,
*NL*
frothing
wave
,
washing
from
its
place
a
florid
gothic
capital
,
drowning
*NL*
the
white
violets
of
the
marble
floor
;
or
else
reabsorbed
into
their
*NL*
limits
,
contracting
still
further
a
crabbed
Latin
inscription
,
*NL*
bringing
a
fresh
touch
of
fantasy
into
the
arrangement
of
its
curtailed
*NL*
characters
,
closing
together
two
letters
of
some
word
of
which
the
rest
*NL*
were
disproportionately
scattered
.
Its
windows
were
never
so
brilliant
*NL*
as
on
days
when
the
sun
scarcely
shone
,
so
that
if
it
was
dull
outside
*NL*
you
might
be
certain
of
fine
weather
in
church
.
One
of
them
was
*NL*
filled
from
top
to
bottom
by
a
solitary
figure
,
like
the
king
on
a
*NL*
playing-card
,
who
lived
up
there
beneath
his
canopy
of
stone
,
between
*NL*
earth
and
heaven
;
and
in
the
blue
light
of
its
slanting
shadow
,
on
*NL*
weekdays
sometimes
,
at
noon
,
when
there
was
no
service
-LRB-
at
one
of
those
*NL*
rare
moments
when
the
airy
,
empty
church
,
more
human
somehow
and
more
*NL*
luxurious
with
the
sun
shewing
off
all
its
rich
furnishings
,
seemed
to
*NL*
have
almost
a
habitable
air
,
like
the
hall
--
all
sculptured
stone
and
*NL*
painted
glass
--
of
some
mediaeval
mansion
-RRB-
,
you
might
see
Mme.
Sazerat
*NL*
kneel
for
an
instant
,
laying
down
on
the
chair
beside
her
own
a
neatly
*NL*
corded
parcel
of
little
cakes
which
she
had
just
bought
at
the
baker
's
*NL*
and
was
taking
home
for
her
luncheon
.
In
another
,
a
mountain
of
rosy
*NL*
snow
,
at
whose
foot
a
battle
was
being
fought
,
seemed
to
have
frozen
the
*NL*
window
also
,
which
it
swelled
and
distorted
with
its
cloudy
sleet
,
like
*NL*
a
pane
to
which
snowflakes
have
drifted
and
clung
,
but
flakes
illumined
*NL*
by
a
sunrise
--
the
same
,
doubtless
,
which
purpled
the
reredos
of
the
*NL*
altar
with
tints
so
fresh
that
they
seemed
rather
to
be
thrown
on
it
for
*NL*
a
moment
by
a
light
shining
from
outside
and
shortly
to
be
extinguished
*NL*
than
painted
and
permanently
fastened
on
the
stone
.
And
all
of
them
*NL*
were
so
old
that
you
could
see
,
here
and
there
,
their
silvery
antiquity
*NL*
sparkling
with
the
dust
of
centuries
and
shewing
in
its
threadbare
*NL*
brilliance
the
very
cords
of
their
lovely
tapestry
of
glass
.
There
*NL*
was
one
among
them
which
was
a
tall
panel
composed
of
a
hundred
little
*NL*
rectangular
windows
,
of
blue
principally
,
like
a
great
game
of
patience
*NL*
of
the
kind
planned
to
beguile
King
Charles
VI
;
but
,
either
because
a
*NL*
ray
of
sunlight
had
gleamed
through
it
or
because
my
own
shifting
vision
*NL*
had
drawn
across
the
window
,
whose
colours
died
away
and
were
rekindled
*NL*
by
turns
,
a
rare
and
transient
fire
--
the
next
instant
it
had
taken
on
*NL*
all
the
iridescence
of
a
peacock
's
tail
,
then
shook
and
wavered
in
a
*NL*
flaming
and
fantastic
shower
,
distilled
and
dropping
from
the
groin
of
*NL*
the
dark
and
rocky
vault
down
the
moist
walls
,
as
though
it
were
*NL*
along
the
bed
of
some
rainbow
grotto
of
sinuous
stalactites
that
I
was
*NL*
following
my
parents
,
who
marched
before
me
,
their
prayer-books
clasped
*NL*
in
their
hands
;
a
moment
later
the
little
lozenge
windows
had
put
on
the
*NL*
deep
transparence
,
the
unbreakable
hardness
of
sapphires
clustered
on
*NL*
some
enormous
breastplate
;
but
beyond
which
could
be
distinguished
,
*NL*
dearer
than
all
such
treasures
,
a
fleeting
smile
from
the
sun
,
which
*NL*
could
be
seen
and
felt
as
well
here
,
in
the
blue
and
gentle
flood
in
*NL*
which
it
washed
the
masonry
,
as
on
the
pavement
of
the
Square
or
the
*NL*
straw
of
the
market-place
;
and
even
on
our
first
Sundays
,
when
we
came
*NL*
down
before
Easter
,
it
would
console
me
for
the
blackness
and
bareness
*NL*
of
the
earth
outside
by
making
burst
into
blossom
,
as
in
some
springtime
*NL*
in
old
history
among
the
heirs
of
Saint
Louis
,
this
dazzling
and
gilded
*NL*
carpet
of
forget-me-nots
in
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
tapestries
of
high
warp
represented
the
coronation
of
Esther
-LRB-
in
*NL*
which
tradition
would
have
it
that
the
weaver
had
given
to
Ahasuerus
the
*NL*
features
of
one
of
the
kings
of
France
and
to
Esther
those
of
a
lady
of
*NL*
Guermantes
whose
lover
he
had
been
-RRB-
;
their
colours
had
melted
into
one
*NL*
another
,
so
as
to
add
expression
,
relief
,
light
to
the
pictures
.
A
touch
*NL*
of
red
over
the
lips
of
Esther
had
strayed
beyond
their
outline
;
the
*NL*
yellow
on
her
dress
was
spread
with
such
unctuous
plumpness
as
to
have
*NL*
acquired
a
kind
of
solidity
,
and
stood
boldly
out
from
the
receding
*NL*
atmosphere
;
while
the
green
of
the
trees
,
which
was
still
bright
in
Silk
*NL*
and
wool
among
the
lower
parts
of
the
panel
,
but
had
quite
`
gone
'
at
the
*NL*
top
,
separated
in
a
paler
scheme
,
above
the
dark
trunks
,
the
yellowing
*NL*
upper
branches
,
tanned
and
half-obliterated
by
the
sharp
though
sidelong
*NL*
rays
of
an
invisible
sun
.
All
these
things
and
,
still
more
than
these
,
*NL*
the
treasures
which
had
come
to
the
church
from
personages
who
to
me
*NL*
were
almost
legendary
figures
-LRB-
such
as
the
golden
cross
wrought
,
it
was
*NL*
said
,
by
Saint
Eloi
and
presented
by
Dagobert
,
and
the
tomb
of
the
sons
*NL*
of
Louis
the
Germanic
in
porphyry
and
enamelled
copper
-RRB-
,
because
of
*NL*
which
I
used
to
go
forward
into
the
church
when
we
were
making
our
way
*NL*
to
our
chairs
as
into
a
fairy-haunted
valley
,
where
the
rustic
sees
with
*NL*
amazement
on
a
rock
,
a
tree
,
a
marsh
,
the
tangible
proofs
of
the
little
*NL*
people
's
supernatural
passage
--
all
these
things
made
of
the
church
for
*NL*
me
something
entirely
different
from
the
rest
of
the
town
;
a
building
*NL*
which
occupied
,
so
to
speak
,
four
dimensions
of
space
--
the
name
of
the
*NL*
fourth
being
Time
--
which
had
sailed
the
centuries
with
that
old
nave
,
*NL*
where
bay
after
bay
,
chapel
after
chapel
,
seemed
to
stretch
across
*NL*
and
hold
down
and
conquer
not
merely
a
few
yards
of
soil
,
but
each
*NL*
successive
epoch
from
which
the
whole
building
had
emerged
triumphant
,
*NL*
hiding
the
rugged
barbarities
of
the
eleventh
century
in
the
thickness
*NL*
of
its
walls
,
through
which
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
heavy
arches
,
*NL*
long
stopped
and
blinded
with
coarse
blocks
of
ashlar
,
except
where
,
*NL*
near
the
porch
,
a
deep
groove
was
furrowed
into
one
wall
by
the
*NL*
tower-stair
;
and
even
there
the
barbarity
was
veiled
by
the
graceful
*NL*
gothic
arcade
which
pressed
coquettishly
upon
it
,
like
a
row
of
grown-up
*NL*
sisters
who
,
to
hide
him
from
the
eyes
of
strangers
,
arrange
themselves
*NL*
smilingly
in
front
of
a
countrified
,
unmannerly
and
ill-dressed
younger
*NL*
brother
;
rearing
into
the
sky
above
the
Square
a
tower
which
had
looked
*NL*
down
upon
Saint
Louis
,
and
seemed
to
behold
him
still
;
and
thrusting
*NL*
down
with
its
crypt
into
the
blackness
of
a
Merovingian
night
,
through
*NL*
which
,
guiding
us
with
groping
finger-tips
beneath
the
shadowy
vault
,
*NL*
ribbed
strongly
as
an
immense
bat
's
wing
of
stone
,
Th√©odore
or
his
*NL*
sister
would
light
up
for
us
with
a
candle
the
tomb
of
Sigebert
's
little
*NL*
daughter
,
in
which
a
deep
hole
,
like
the
bed
of
a
fossil
,
had
been
*NL*
bored
,
or
so
it
was
said
,
``
by
a
crystal
lamp
which
,
on
the
night
when
*NL*
the
Frankish
princess
was
murdered
,
had
left
,
of
its
own
accord
,
the
*NL*
golden
chains
by
which
it
was
suspended
where
the
apse
is
to-day
and
*NL*
with
neither
the
crystal
broken
nor
the
light
extinguished
had
buried
*NL*
itself
in
the
stone
,
through
which
it
had
gently
forced
its
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
apse
of
Combray
:
what
am
I
to
say
of
that
?
It
was
so
*NL*
coarse
,
so
devoid
of
artistic
beauty
,
even
of
the
religious
spirit
.
From
*NL*
outside
,
since
the
street
crossing
which
it
commanded
was
on
a
lower
*NL*
level
,
its
great
wall
was
thrust
upwards
from
a
basement
of
unfaced
*NL*
ashlar
,
jagged
with
flints
,
in
all
of
which
there
was
nothing
*NL*
particularly
ecclesiastical
;
the
windows
seemed
to
have
been
pierced
at
*NL*
an
abnormal
height
,
and
its
whole
appearance
was
that
of
a
prison
wall
*NL*
rather
than
of
a
church
.
And
certainly
in
later
years
,
were
I
to
recall
*NL*
all
the
glorious
apses
that
I
had
seen
,
it
would
never
enter
my
mind
to
*NL*
compare
with
any
one
of
them
the
apse
of
Combray
.
Only
,
one
day
,
*NL*
turning
out
of
a
little
street
in
some
country
town
,
I
came
upon
three
*NL*
alley-ways
that
converged
,
and
facing
them
an
old
wall
,
rubbed
,
worn
,
*NL*
crumbling
,
and
unusually
high
;
with
windows
pierced
in
it
far
overhead
*NL*
and
the
same
asymmetrical
appearance
as
the
apse
of
Combray
.
And
at
that
*NL*
moment
I
did
not
say
to
myself
,
as
at
Chartres
I
might
have
done
or
at
*NL*
Rheims
,
with
what
strength
the
religious
feeling
had
been
expressed
in
*NL*
its
construction
,
but
instinctively
I
exclaimed
``
The
Church
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
church
!
A
dear
,
familiar
friend
;
close
pressed
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Hilaire
,
upon
which
its
north
door
opened
,
by
its
two
neighbours
,
*NL*
Mme.
Loiseau
's
house
and
the
pharmacy
of
M.
Rapin
,
against
which
its
*NL*
walls
rested
without
interspace
;
a
simple
citizen
of
Combray
,
who
might
*NL*
have
had
her
number
in
the
street
had
the
streets
of
Combray
borne
*NL*
numbers
,
and
at
whose
door
one
felt
that
the
postman
ought
to
stop
on
*NL*
his
morning
rounds
,
before
going
into
Mme.
Loiseau
's
and
after
leaving
*NL*
M.
Rapin
's
,
there
existed
,
for
all
that
,
between
the
church
and
*NL*
everything
in
Combray
that
was
not
the
church
a
clear
line
of
*NL*
demarcation
which
I
have
never
succeeded
in
eliminating
from
my
mind
.
*NL*
In
vain
might
Mme.
Loiseau
deck
her
window-sills
with
fuchsias
,
which
*NL*
developed
the
bad
habit
of
letting
their
branches
trail
at
all
times
*NL*
and
in
all
directions
,
head
downwards
,
and
whose
flowers
had
no
more
*NL*
important
business
,
when
they
were
big
enough
to
taste
the
joys
of
life
,
*NL*
than
to
go
and
cool
their
purple
,
congested
cheeks
against
the
dark
*NL*
front
of
the
church
;
to
me
such
conduct
sanctified
the
fuchsias
not
at
*NL*
all
;
between
the
flowers
and
the
blackened
stones
towards
which
they
*NL*
leaned
,
if
my
eyes
could
discern
no
interval
,
my
mind
preserved
the
*NL*
impression
of
an
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
long
way
off
one
could
distinguish
and
identify
the
steeple
of
*NL*
Saint-Hilaire
inscribing
its
unforgettable
form
upon
a
horizon
beneath
*NL*
which
Combray
had
not
yet
appeared
;
when
from
the
train
which
brought
*NL*
us
down
from
Paris
at
Easter-time
my
father
caught
sight
of
it
,
as
it
*NL*
slipped
into
every
fold
of
the
sky
in
turn
,
its
little
iron
cock
veering
*NL*
continually
in
all
directions
,
he
would
say
:
``
Come
,
get
your
wraps
*NL*
together
,
we
are
there
.
''
And
on
one
of
the
longest
walks
we
ever
took
*NL*
from
Combray
there
was
a
spot
where
the
narrow
road
emerged
suddenly
*NL*
on
to
an
immense
plain
,
closed
at
the
horizon
by
strips
of
forest
over
*NL*
which
rose
and
stood
alone
the
fine
point
of
Saint-Hilaire
's
steeple
,
*NL*
but
so
sharpened
and
so
pink
that
it
seemed
to
be
no
more
than
sketched
*NL*
on
the
sky
by
the
finger-nail
of
a
painter
anxious
to
give
to
such
a
*NL*
landscape
,
to
so
pure
a
piece
of
`
nature
,
'
this
little
sign
of
art
,
this
*NL*
single
indication
of
human
existence
.
As
one
drew
near
it
and
could
make
*NL*
out
the
remains
of
the
square
tower
,
half
in
ruins
,
which
still
stood
by
*NL*
its
side
,
though
without
rivalling
it
in
height
,
one
was
struck
,
first
*NL*
of
all
,
by
the
tone
,
reddish
and
sombre
,
of
its
stones
;
and
on
a
misty
*NL*
morning
in
autumn
one
would
have
called
it
,
to
see
it
rising
above
the
*NL*
violet
thunder-cloud
of
the
vineyards
,
a
ruin
of
purple
,
almost
the
*NL*
colour
of
the
wild
vine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
in
the
Square
,
as
we
came
home
,
my
grandmother
would
make
me
stop
*NL*
to
look
up
at
it
.
From
the
tower
windows
,
placed
two
and
two
,
one
pair
*NL*
above
another
,
with
that
right
and
original
proportion
in
their
spacing
*NL*
to
which
not
only
human
faces
owe
their
beauty
and
dignity
,
it
released
,
*NL*
it
let
fall
at
regular
intervals
flights
of
jackdaws
which
for
a
little
*NL*
while
would
wheel
and
caw
,
as
though
the
ancient
stones
which
allowed
*NL*
them
to
sport
thus
and
never
seemed
to
see
them
,
becoming
of
a
sudden
*NL*
uninhabitable
and
discharging
some
infinitely
disturbing
element
,
had
*NL*
struck
them
and
driven
them
forth
.
Then
after
patterning
everywhere
the
*NL*
violet
velvet
of
the
evening
air
,
abruptly
soothed
,
they
would
return
*NL*
and
be
absorbed
in
the
tower
,
deadly
no
longer
but
benignant
,
some
*NL*
perching
here
and
there
-LRB-
not
seeming
to
move
,
but
snapping
,
perhaps
,
and
*NL*
swallowing
some
passing
insect
-RRB-
on
the
points
of
turrets
,
as
a
seagull
*NL*
perches
,
with
an
angler
's
immobility
,
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
.
Without
*NL*
quite
knowing
why
,
my
grandmother
found
in
the
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
*NL*
that
absence
of
vulgarity
,
pretension
,
and
meanness
which
made
her
*NL*
love
--
and
deem
rich
in
beneficent
influences
--
nature
itself
,
when
the
*NL*
hand
of
man
had
not
,
as
did
my
great-aunt
's
gardener
,
trimmed
it
,
and
*NL*
the
works
of
genius
.
And
certainly
every
part
one
saw
of
the
church
*NL*
served
to
distinguish
the
whole
from
any
other
building
by
a
kind
of
*NL*
general
feeling
which
pervaded
it
,
but
it
was
in
the
steeple
that
*NL*
the
church
seemed
to
display
a
consciousness
of
itself
,
to
affirm
its
*NL*
individual
and
responsible
existence
.
It
was
the
steeple
which
spoke
for
*NL*
the
church
.
I
think
,
too
,
that
in
a
confused
way
my
grandmother
found
in
*NL*
the
steeple
of
Combray
what
she
prized
above
anything
else
in
the
*NL*
world
,
namely
,
a
natural
air
and
an
air
of
distinction
.
Ignorant
of
*NL*
architecture
,
she
would
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dears
,
laugh
at
me
if
you
like
;
it
is
not
conventionally
beautiful
,
*NL*
but
there
is
something
in
its
quaint
old
face
which
pleases
me
.
If
it
*NL*
could
play
the
piano
,
I
am
sure
it
would
really
_
play
_
.
''
And
when
she
*NL*
gazed
on
it
,
when
her
eyes
followed
the
gentle
tension
,
the
fervent
*NL*
inclination
of
its
stony
slopes
which
drew
together
as
they
rose
,
like
*NL*
hands
joined
in
prayer
,
she
would
absorb
herself
so
utterly
in
the
*NL*
outpouring
of
the
spire
that
her
gaze
seemed
to
leap
upwards
with
it
;
*NL*
her
lips
at
the
same
time
curving
in
a
friendly
smile
for
the
worn
old
*NL*
stones
of
which
the
setting
sun
now
illumined
no
more
than
the
topmost
*NL*
pinnacles
,
which
,
at
the
point
where
they
entered
that
zone
of
sunlight
*NL*
and
were
softened
and
sweetened
by
it
,
seemed
to
have
mounted
suddenly
*NL*
far
higher
,
to
have
become
truly
remote
,
like
a
song
whose
singer
breaks
*NL*
into
falsetto
,
an
octave
above
the
accompanying
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
which
shaped
and
crowned
and
*NL*
consecrated
every
occupation
,
every
hour
of
the
day
,
every
point
of
view
*NL*
in
the
town
.
From
my
bedroom
window
I
could
discern
no
more
than
its
*NL*
base
,
which
had
been
freshly
covered
with
slates
;
but
when
on
Sundays
I
*NL*
saw
these
,
in
the
hot
light
of
a
summer
morning
,
blaze
like
a
black
sun
*NL*
I
would
say
to
myself
:
``
Good
heavens
!
nine
o'clock
!
I
must
get
ready
for
*NL*
mass
at
once
if
I
am
to
have
time
to
go
in
and
kiss
aunt
L√©onie
first
,
''
*NL*
and
I
would
know
exactly
what
was
the
colour
of
the
sunlight
upon
the
*NL*
Square
,
I
could
feel
the
heat
and
dust
of
the
market
,
the
shade
behind
*NL*
the
blinds
of
the
shop
into
which
Mamma
would
perhaps
go
on
her
way
*NL*
to
mass
,
penetrating
its
odour
of
unbleached
calico
,
to
purchase
a
*NL*
handkerchief
or
something
,
of
which
the
draper
himself
would
let
her
see
*NL*
what
he
had
,
bowing
from
the
waist
:
who
,
having
made
everything
ready
*NL*
for
shutting
up
,
had
just
gone
into
the
back
shop
to
put
on
his
Sunday
*NL*
coat
and
to
wash
his
hands
,
which
it
was
his
habit
,
every
few
minutes
*NL*
and
even
on
the
saddest
occasions
,
to
rub
one
against
the
other
with
an
*NL*
air
of
enterprise
,
cunning
,
and
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
,
after
mass
,
when
we
looked
in
to
tell
Th√©odore
to
bring
a
*NL*
larger
loaf
than
usual
because
our
cousins
had
taken
advantage
of
the
*NL*
fine
weather
to
come
over
from
Thiberzy
for
luncheon
,
we
had
in
front
of
*NL*
us
the
steeple
,
which
,
baked
and
brown
itself
like
a
larger
loaf
still
*NL*
of
`
holy
bread
,
'
with
flakes
and
sticky
drops
on
it
of
sunlight
,
pricked
*NL*
its
sharp
point
into
the
blue
sky
.
And
in
the
evening
,
as
I
came
in
from
*NL*
my
walk
and
thought
of
the
approaching
moment
when
I
must
say
good
night
*NL*
to
my
mother
and
see
her
no
more
,
the
steeple
was
by
contrast
so
kindly
,
*NL*
there
at
the
close
of
day
,
that
I
would
imagine
it
as
being
laid
,
like
a
*NL*
brown
velvet
cushion
,
against
--
as
being
thrust
into
the
pallid
sky
which
*NL*
had
yielded
beneath
its
pressure
,
had
sunk
slightly
so
as
to
make
room
*NL*
for
it
,
and
had
correspondingly
risen
on
either
side
;
while
the
cries
of
*NL*
the
birds
wheeling
to
and
fro
about
it
seemed
to
intensify
its
silence
,
*NL*
to
elongate
its
spire
still
further
,
and
to
invest
it
with
some
quality
*NL*
beyond
the
power
of
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
when
our
errands
lay
in
places
behind
the
church
,
from
which
it
*NL*
could
not
be
seen
,
the
view
seemed
always
to
have
been
composed
with
*NL*
reference
to
the
steeple
,
which
would
stand
up
,
now
here
,
now
there
,
*NL*
among
the
houses
,
and
was
perhaps
even
more
affecting
when
it
appeared
*NL*
thus
without
the
church
.
And
,
indeed
,
there
are
many
others
which
*NL*
look
best
when
seen
in
this
way
,
and
I
can
call
to
mind
vignettes
of
*NL*
housetops
with
surmounting
steeples
in
quite
another
category
of
art
*NL*
than
those
formed
by
the
dreary
streets
of
Combray
.
I
shall
never
*NL*
forget
,
in
a
quaint
Norman
town
not
far
from
Balbec
,
two
charming
*NL*
eighteenth-century
houses
,
dear
to
me
and
venerable
for
many
reasons
,
*NL*
between
which
,
when
one
looks
up
at
them
from
a
fine
garden
which
*NL*
descends
in
terraces
to
the
river
,
the
gothic
spire
of
a
church
-LRB-
itself
*NL*
hidden
by
the
houses
-RRB-
soars
into
the
sky
with
the
effect
of
crowning
and
*NL*
completing
their
fronts
,
but
in
a
material
so
different
,
so
precious
,
so
*NL*
beringed
,
so
rosy
,
so
polished
,
that
it
is
at
once
seen
to
be
no
more
*NL*
a
part
of
them
than
would
be
a
part
of
two
pretty
pebbles
lying
side
*NL*
by
side
,
between
which
it
had
been
washed
on
the
beach
,
the
purple
,
*NL*
crinkled
spire
of
some
sea-shell
spun
out
into
a
turret
and
gay
with
*NL*
glossy
colour
.
Even
in
Paris
,
in
one
of
the
ugliest
parts
of
the
town
,
I
*NL*
know
a
window
from
which
one
can
see
across
a
first
,
a
second
,
and
even
*NL*
a
third
layer
of
jumbled
roofs
,
street
beyond
street
,
a
violet
bell
,
*NL*
sometimes
ruddy
,
sometimes
too
,
in
the
finest
`
prints
'
which
the
*NL*
atmosphere
makes
of
it
,
of
an
ashy
solution
of
black
;
which
is
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
nothing
else
than
the
dome
of
Saint-Augustin
,
and
which
imparts
to
this
*NL*
view
of
Paris
the
character
of
some
of
the
Piranesi
views
of
Rome
.
But
*NL*
since
into
none
of
these
little
etchings
,
whatever
the
taste
my
*NL*
memory
may
have
been
able
to
bring
to
their
execution
,
was
it
able
to
*NL*
contribute
an
element
I
have
long
lost
,
the
feeling
which
makes
us
not
*NL*
merely
regard
a
thing
as
a
spectacle
,
but
believe
in
it
as
in
a
creature
*NL*
without
parallel
,
so
none
of
them
keeps
in
dependence
on
it
a
whole
*NL*
section
of
my
inmost
life
as
does
the
memory
of
those
aspects
of
the
*NL*
steeple
of
Combray
from
the
streets
behind
the
church
.
Whether
one
saw
*NL*
it
at
five
o'clock
when
going
to
call
for
letters
at
the
post-office
,
*NL*
some
doors
away
from
one
,
on
the
left
,
raising
abruptly
with
its
*NL*
isolated
peak
the
ridge
of
housetops
;
or
again
,
when
one
had
to
go
in
*NL*
and
ask
for
news
of
Mme.
Sazerat
,
one
's
eyes
followed
the
line
where
it
*NL*
ran
low
again
beyond
the
farther
,
descending
slope
,
and
one
knew
that
it
*NL*
would
be
the
second
turning
after
the
steeple
;
or
yet
again
,
if
pressing
*NL*
further
afield
one
went
to
the
station
,
one
saw
it
obliquely
,
shewing
in
*NL*
profile
fresh
angles
and
surfaces
,
like
a
solid
body
surprised
at
some
*NL*
unknown
point
in
its
revolution
;
or
,
from
the
banks
of
the
Vivonne
,
the
*NL*
apse
,
drawn
muscularly
together
and
heightened
in
perspective
,
seemed
*NL*
to
spring
upwards
with
the
effort
which
the
steeple
made
to
hurl
its
*NL*
spire-point
into
the
heart
of
heaven
:
it
was
always
to
the
steeple
that
*NL*
one
must
return
,
always
it
which
dominated
everything
else
,
summing
up
*NL*
the
houses
with
an
unexpected
pinnacle
,
raised
before
me
like
the
Finger
*NL*
of
God
,
Whose
Body
might
have
been
concealed
below
among
the
crowd
of
*NL*
human
bodies
without
fear
of
my
confounding
It
,
for
that
reason
,
with
*NL*
them
.
And
so
even
to-day
in
any
large
provincial
town
,
or
in
a
quarter
*NL*
of
Paris
which
I
do
not
know
well
,
if
a
passer-by
who
is
`
putting
me
on
*NL*
the
right
road
'
shews
me
from
afar
,
as
a
point
to
aim
at
,
some
belfry
of
*NL*
a
hospital
,
or
a
convent
steeple
lifting
the
peak
of
its
ecclesiastical
*NL*
cap
at
the
corner
of
the
street
which
I
am
to
take
,
my
memory
need
only
*NL*
find
in
it
some
dim
resemblance
to
that
dear
and
vanished
outline
,
and
*NL*
the
passer-by
,
should
he
turn
round
to
make
sure
that
I
have
not
gone
*NL*
astray
,
would
see
me
,
to
his
astonishment
,
oblivious
of
the
walk
that
I
*NL*
had
planned
to
take
or
the
place
where
I
was
obliged
to
call
,
standing
*NL*
still
on
the
spot
,
before
that
steeple
,
for
hours
on
end
,
motionless
,
*NL*
trying
to
remember
,
feeling
deep
within
myself
a
tract
of
soil
reclaimed
*NL*
from
the
waters
of
Lethe
slowly
drying
until
the
buildings
rise
on
it
*NL*
again
;
and
then
no
doubt
,
and
then
more
uneasily
than
when
,
just
now
,
*NL*
I
asked
him
for
a
direction
,
I
will
seek
my
way
again
,
I
will
turn
a
*NL*
corner
...
but
...
the
goal
is
in
my
heart
...
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
way
home
from
mass
we
would
often
meet
M.
Legrandin
,
who
,
*NL*
detained
in
Paris
by
his
professional
duties
as
an
engineer
,
could
*NL*
only
-LRB-
except
in
the
regular
holiday
seasons
-RRB-
visit
his
home
at
Combray
*NL*
between
Saturday
evenings
and
Monday
mornings
.
He
was
one
of
that
class
*NL*
of
men
who
,
apart
from
a
scientific
career
in
which
they
may
well
have
*NL*
proved
brilliantly
successful
,
have
acquired
an
entirely
different
*NL*
kind
of
culture
,
literary
or
artistic
,
of
which
they
make
no
use
in
the
*NL*
specialised
work
of
their
profession
,
but
by
which
their
conversation
*NL*
profits
.
More
`
literary
'
than
many
`
men
of
letters
'
-LRB-
we
were
not
aware
*NL*
at
this
period
that
M.
Legrandin
had
a
distinct
reputation
as
a
writer
,
*NL*
and
so
were
greatly
astonished
to
find
that
a
well-known
composer
*NL*
had
set
some
verses
of
his
to
music
-RRB-
,
endowed
with
a
greater
ease
*NL*
in
execution
than
many
painters
,
they
imagine
that
the
life
they
are
*NL*
obliged
to
lead
is
not
that
for
which
they
are
really
fitted
,
and
they
*NL*
bring
to
their
regular
occupations
either
a
fantastic
indifference
or
*NL*
a
sustained
and
lofty
application
,
scornful
,
bitter
,
and
conscientious
.
*NL*
Tall
,
with
a
good
figure
,
a
fine
,
thoughtful
face
,
drooping
fair
*NL*
moustaches
,
a
look
of
disillusionment
in
his
blue
eyes
,
an
almost
*NL*
exaggerated
refinement
of
courtesy
;
a
talker
such
as
we
had
never
heard
;
*NL*
he
was
in
the
sight
of
my
family
,
who
never
ceased
to
quote
him
as
an
*NL*
example
,
the
very
pattern
of
a
gentleman
,
who
took
life
in
the
noblest
*NL*
and
most
delicate
manner
.
My
grandmother
alone
found
fault
with
him
for
*NL*
speaking
a
little
too
well
,
a
little
too
much
like
a
book
,
for
not
using
*NL*
a
vocabulary
as
natural
as
his
loosely
knotted
Lavalli√®re
neckties
,
his
*NL*
short
,
straight
,
almost
schoolboyish
coat
.
She
was
astonished
,
too
,
at
*NL*
the
furious
invective
which
he
was
always
launching
at
the
aristocracy
,
*NL*
at
fashionable
life
,
and
`
snobbishness
'
--
``
undoubtedly
,
''
he
would
say
,
*NL*
``
the
sin
of
which
Saint
Paul
is
thinking
when
he
speaks
of
the
sin
for
*NL*
which
there
is
no
forgiveness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Worldly
ambition
was
a
thing
which
my
grandmother
was
so
little
capable
*NL*
of
feeling
,
or
indeed
of
understanding
,
that
it
seemed
to
her
futile
to
*NL*
apply
so
much
heat
to
its
condemnation
.
Besides
,
she
thought
it
in
not
*NL*
very
good
taste
that
M.
Legrandin
,
whose
sister
was
married
to
a
country
*NL*
gentleman
of
Lower
Normandy
near
Balbec
,
should
deliver
himself
of
such
*NL*
violent
attacks
upon
the
nobles
,
going
so
far
as
to
blame
the
Revolution
*NL*
for
not
having
guillotined
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
met
,
my
friends
!
''
he
would
say
as
he
came
towards
us
.
``
You
are
*NL*
lucky
to
spend
so
much
time
here
;
to-morrow
I
have
to
go
back
to
Paris
,
*NL*
to
squeeze
back
into
my
niche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
admit
,
''
he
went
on
,
with
his
own
peculiar
smile
,
gently
ironical
,
*NL*
disillusioned
and
vague
,
``
I
have
every
useless
thing
in
the
world
in
*NL*
my
house
there
.
The
only
thing
wanting
is
the
necessary
thing
,
a
great
*NL*
patch
of
open
sky
like
this
.
Always
try
to
keep
a
patch
of
sky
above
*NL*
your
life
,
little
boy
,
''
he
added
,
turning
to
me
.
``
You
have
a
soul
in
*NL*
you
of
rare
quality
,
an
artist
's
nature
;
never
let
it
starve
for
lack
of
*NL*
what
it
needs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
on
our
reaching
the
house
,
my
aunt
would
send
to
ask
us
whether
*NL*
Mme.
Goupil
had
indeed
arrived
late
for
mass
,
not
one
of
us
could
inform
*NL*
her
.
Instead
,
we
increased
her
anxiety
by
telling
her
that
there
was
*NL*
a
painter
at
work
in
the
church
copying
the
window
of
Gilbert
the
*NL*
Bad
.
Fran√ßoise
was
at
once
dispatched
to
the
grocer
's
,
but
returned
*NL*
empty-handed
owing
to
the
absence
of
Th√©odore
,
whose
dual
profession
of
*NL*
choirman
,
with
a
part
in
the
maintenance
of
the
fabric
,
and
of
grocer
's
*NL*
assistant
gave
him
not
only
relations
with
all
sections
of
society
,
but
*NL*
an
encyclopaedic
knowledge
of
their
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
my
aunt
would
sigh
,
``
I
wish
it
were
time
for
Eulalie
to
come
.
She
*NL*
is
really
the
only
person
who
will
be
able
to
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eulalie
was
a
limping
,
energetic
,
deaf
spinster
who
had
`
retired
'
after
*NL*
the
death
of
Mme.
de
la
Bretonnerie
,
with
whom
she
had
been
in
service
*NL*
from
her
childhood
,
and
had
then
taken
a
room
beside
the
church
,
from
*NL*
which
she
would
incessantly
emerge
,
either
to
attend
some
service
,
*NL*
or
,
when
there
was
no
service
,
to
say
a
prayer
by
herself
or
to
give
*NL*
Th√©odore
a
hand
;
the
rest
of
her
time
she
spent
in
visiting
sick
persons
*NL*
like
my
aunt
L√©onie
,
to
whom
she
would
relate
everything
that
had
*NL*
occurred
at
mass
or
vespers
.
She
was
not
above
adding
occasional
*NL*
pocket-money
to
the
little
income
which
was
found
for
her
by
the
family
*NL*
of
her
old
employers
by
going
from
time
to
time
to
look
after
the
Cur√©
's
*NL*
linen
,
or
that
of
some
other
person
of
note
in
the
clerical
world
of
*NL*
Combray
.
Above
a
mantle
of
black
cloth
she
wore
a
little
white
coif
that
*NL*
seemed
almost
to
attach
her
to
some
Order
,
and
an
infirmity
of
the
*NL*
skin
had
stained
part
of
her
cheeks
and
her
crooked
nose
the
bright
red
*NL*
colour
of
balsam
.
Her
visits
were
the
one
great
distraction
in
the
life
*NL*
of
my
aunt
L√©onie
,
who
now
saw
hardly
anyone
else
,
except
the
reverend
*NL*
Cur√©
.
My
aunt
had
by
degrees
erased
every
other
visitor
's
name
from
*NL*
her
list
,
because
they
all
committed
the
fatal
error
,
in
her
eyes
,
*NL*
of
falling
into
one
or
other
of
the
two
categories
of
people
she
most
*NL*
detested
.
One
group
,
the
worse
of
the
two
,
and
the
one
of
which
she
rid
*NL*
herself
first
,
consisted
of
those
who
advised
her
not
to
take
so
much
*NL*
care
of
herself
,
and
preached
-LRB-
even
if
only
negatively
and
with
no
*NL*
outward
signs
beyond
an
occasional
disapproving
silence
or
doubting
*NL*
smile
-RRB-
the
subversive
doctrine
that
a
sharp
walk
in
the
sun
and
a
good
*NL*
red
beefsteak
would
do
her
more
good
-LRB-
her
,
who
had
had
two
dreadful
sips
*NL*
of
Vichy
water
on
her
stomach
for
fourteen
hours
!
-RRB-
than
all
her
medicine
*NL*
bottles
and
her
bed
.
The
other
category
was
composed
of
people
who
*NL*
appeared
to
believe
that
she
was
more
seriously
ill
than
she
thought
,
*NL*
in
fact
that
she
was
as
seriously
ill
as
she
said
.
And
so
none
of
those
*NL*
whom
she
had
allowed
upstairs
to
her
room
,
after
considerable
hesitation
*NL*
and
at
Fran√ßoise
urgent
request
,
and
who
in
the
course
of
their
visit
*NL*
had
shewn
how
unworthy
they
were
of
the
honour
which
had
been
done
them
*NL*
by
venturing
a
timid
:
``
Do
n't
you
think
that
if
you
were
just
to
stir
out
*NL*
a
little
on
really
fine
days
...
?
''
or
who
,
on
the
other
hand
,
when
she
*NL*
said
to
them
:
``
I
am
very
low
,
very
low
;
nearing
the
end
,
dear
friends
!
''
*NL*
had
replied
:
``
Ah
,
yes
,
when
one
has
no
strength
left
!
Still
,
you
may
*NL*
last
a
while
yet
''
;
each
party
alike
might
be
certain
that
her
doors
*NL*
would
never
open
to
them
again
.
And
if
Fran√ßoise
was
amused
by
the
look
*NL*
of
consternation
on
my
aunt
's
face
whenever
she
saw
,
from
her
bed
,
any
*NL*
of
these
people
in
the
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
,
who
looked
as
if
they
were
*NL*
coming
to
see
her
,
or
heard
her
own
door-bell
ring
,
she
would
laugh
far
*NL*
more
heartily
,
as
at
a
clever
trick
,
at
my
aunt
's
devices
-LRB-
which
never
*NL*
failed
-RRB-
for
having
them
sent
away
,
and
at
their
look
of
discomfiture
*NL*
when
they
had
to
turn
back
without
having
seen
her
;
and
would
be
filled
*NL*
with
secret
admiration
for
her
mistress
,
whom
she
felt
to
be
superior
*NL*
to
all
these
other
people
,
inasmuch
as
she
could
and
did
contrive
not
to
*NL*
see
them
.
In
short
,
my
aunt
stipulated
,
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
that
*NL*
whoever
came
to
see
her
must
approve
of
her
way
of
life
,
commiserate
*NL*
with
her
in
her
sufferings
,
and
assure
her
of
an
ultimate
recovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
this
Eulalie
excelled
.
My
aunt
might
say
to
her
twenty
times
in
*NL*
a
minute
:
``
The
end
is
come
at
last
,
my
poor
Eulalie
!
''
,
twenty
times
*NL*
Eulalie
would
retort
with
:
``
Knowing
your
illness
as
you
do
,
Mme.
*NL*
Octave
,
you
will
live
to
be
a
hundred
,
as
Mme.
Sazerin
said
to
me
only
*NL*
yesterday
.
''
For
one
of
Eulalie
's
most
rooted
beliefs
,
and
one
that
the
*NL*
formidable
list
of
corrections
which
her
experience
must
have
compiled
*NL*
was
powerless
to
eradicate
,
was
that
Mme.
Sazerat
's
name
was
really
Mme.
*NL*
Sazerin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
ask
to
live
to
a
hundred
,
''
my
aunt
would
say
,
for
she
*NL*
preferred
to
have
no
definite
limit
fixed
to
the
number
of
her
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
since
,
besides
this
,
Eulalie
knew
,
as
no
one
else
knew
,
how
to
*NL*
distract
my
aunt
without
tiring
her
,
her
visits
,
which
took
place
*NL*
regularly
every
Sunday
,
unless
something
unforeseen
occurred
to
prevent
*NL*
them
,
were
for
my
aunt
a
pleasure
the
prospect
of
which
kept
her
on
*NL*
those
days
in
a
state
of
expectation
,
appetising
enough
to
begin
with
,
*NL*
but
at
once
changing
to
the
agony
of
a
hunger
too
long
unsatisfied
if
*NL*
Eulalie
were
a
minute
late
in
coming
.
For
,
if
unduly
prolonged
,
the
*NL*
rapture
of
waiting
for
Eulalie
became
a
torture
,
and
my
aunt
would
never
*NL*
cease
from
looking
at
the
time
,
and
yawning
,
and
complaining
of
each
of
*NL*
her
symptoms
in
turn
.
Eulalie
's
ring
,
if
it
sounded
from
the
front
door
*NL*
at
the
very
end
of
the
day
,
when
she
was
no
longer
expecting
it
,
would
*NL*
almost
make
her
ill
.
For
the
fact
was
that
on
Sundays
she
thought
of
*NL*
nothing
else
than
this
visit
,
and
the
moment
that
our
luncheon
was
ended
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
would
become
impatient
for
us
to
leave
the
dining-room
so
that
*NL*
she
might
go
upstairs
to
`
occupy
'
my
aunt
.
But
--
and
this
more
than
ever
*NL*
from
the
day
on
which
fine
weather
definitely
set
in
at
Combray
--
the
*NL*
proud
hour
¬∞
f
noon
,
descending
from
the
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
which
*NL*
it
blazoned
for
a
moment
with
the
twelve
points
of
its
sonorous
crown
,
*NL*
would
long
have
echoed
about
our
table
,
beside
the
`
holy
bread
,
'
which
*NL*
too
had
come
in
,
after
church
,
in
its
familiar
way
;
and
we
would
still
*NL*
be
found
seated
in
front
of
our
Arabian
Nights
plates
,
weighed
down
*NL*
by
the
heat
of
the
day
,
and
even
more
by
our
heavy
meal
.
For
upon
*NL*
the
permanent
foundation
of
eggs
,
cutlets
,
potatoes
,
preserves
,
and
*NL*
biscuits
,
whose
appearance
on
the
table
she
no
longer
announced
to
us
,
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
would
add
--
as
the
labour
of
fields
and
orchards
,
the
harvest
*NL*
of
the
tides
,
the
luck
of
the
markets
,
the
kindness
of
neighbours
,
and
*NL*
her
own
genius
might
provide
;
and
so
effectively
that
our
bill
of
fare
,
*NL*
like
the
quatrefoils
that
were
carved
on
the
porches
of
cathedrals
*NL*
in
the
thirteenth
century
,
reflected
to
some
extent
the
march
of
the
*NL*
seasons
and
the
incidents
of
human
life
--
a
brill
,
because
the
fish-woman
*NL*
had
guaranteed
its
freshness
;
a
turkey
,
because
she
had
seen
a
beauty
*NL*
in
the
market
at
Roussainville-le-Pin
;
cardoons
with
marrow
,
because
she
*NL*
had
never
done
them
for
us
in
that
way
before
;
a
roast
leg
of
mutton
,
*NL*
because
the
fresh
air
made
one
hungry
and
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
*NL*
for
it
to
`
settle
down
'
in
the
seven
hours
before
dinner
;
spinach
,
*NL*
by
way
of
a
change
;
apricots
,
because
they
were
still
hard
to
get
;
*NL*
gooseberries
,
because
in
another
fortnight
there
would
be
none
left
;
*NL*
raspberries
,
which
M.
Swann
had
brought
specially
;
cherries
,
the
first
*NL*
to
come
from
the
cherry-tree
,
which
had
yielded
none
for
the
last
two
*NL*
years
;
a
cream
cheese
,
of
which
in
those
days
I
was
extremely
fond
;
an
*NL*
almond
cake
,
because
she
had
ordered
one
the
evening
before
;
a
fancy
*NL*
loaf
,
because
it
was
our
turn
to
`
offer
'
the
holy
bread
.
And
when
all
*NL*
these
had
been
eaten
,
a
work
composed
expressly
for
ourselves
,
but
*NL*
dedicated
more
particularly
to
my
father
,
who
had
a
fondness
for
such
*NL*
things
,
a
cream
of
chocolate
,
inspired
in
the
mind
,
created
by
the
*NL*
hand
of
Fran√ßoise
,
would
be
laid
before
us
,
light
and
fleeting
as
an
*NL*
`
occasional
piece
'
of
music
,
into
which
she
had
poured
the
whole
of
her
*NL*
talent
.
Anyone
who
refused
to
partake
of
it
,
saying
:
``
No
,
thank
you
,
I
*NL*
have
finished
;
I
am
not
hungry
,
''
would
at
once
have
been
lowered
to
the
*NL*
level
of
the
Philistines
who
,
when
an
artist
makes
them
a
present
of
one
*NL*
of
his
works
,
examine
its
weight
and
material
,
whereas
what
is
of
value
*NL*
is
the
creator
's
intention
and
his
signature
.
To
have
left
even
the
*NL*
tiniest
morsel
in
the
dish
would
have
shewn
as
much
discourtesy
as
to
*NL*
rise
and
leave
a
concert
hall
while
the
`
piece
'
was
still
being
played
,
*NL*
and
under
the
composer
's
-
very
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
my
mother
would
say
to
me
:
``
Now
,
do
n't
stay
here
all
day
;
*NL*
you
can
go
up
to
your
room
if
you
are
too
hot
outside
,
but
get
a
little
*NL*
fresh
air
first
;
do
n't
start
reading
immediately
after
your
food
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
would
go
and
sit
down
beside
the
pump
and
its
trough
,
ornamented
*NL*
here
and
there
,
like
a
gothic
font
,
with
a
salamander
,
which
modelled
*NL*
upon
a
background
of
crumbling
stone
the
quick
relief
of
its
slender
,
*NL*
allegorical
body
;
on
the
bench
without
a
back
,
in
the
shade
of
a
*NL*
lilac-tree
,
in
that
little
corner
of
the
garden
which
communicated
,
by
*NL*
a
service
door
,
with
the
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
,
and
from
whose
neglected
*NL*
soil
rose
,
in
two
stages
,
an
outcrop
from
the
house
itself
and
*NL*
apparently
a
separate
building
,
my
aunt
's
back-kitchen
.
One
could
see
*NL*
its
red-tiled
floor
gleaming
like
porphyry
.
It
seemed
not
so
much
the
*NL*
cave
of
Fran√ßoise
as
a
little
temple
of
Venus
.
It
would
be
overflowing
*NL*
with
the
offerings
of
the
milkman
,
the
fruiterer
,
the
greengrocer
,
come
*NL*
sometimes
from
distant
villages
to
dedicate
here
the
first-fruits
of
*NL*
their
fields
.
And
its
roof
was
always
surmounted
by
the
cooing
of
a
*NL*
dove
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
earlier
days
I
would
not
have
lingered
in
the
sacred
grove
which
*NL*
surrounded
this
temple
,
for
,
before
going
upstairs
to
read
,
I
would
*NL*
steal
into
the
little
sitting-room
which
my
uncle
Adolphe
,
a
brother
of
*NL*
my
grandfather
and
an
old
soldier
who
had
retired
from
the
service
as
a
*NL*
major
,
used
to
occupy
on
the
ground
floor
,
a
room
which
,
even
when
its
*NL*
opened
windows
let
in
the
heat
,
if
not
actually
the
rays
of
the
sun
*NL*
which
seldom
penetrated
so
far
,
would
never
fail
to
emit
that
vague
and
*NL*
yet
fresh
odour
,
suggesting
at
once
an
open-air
and
an
old-fashioned
*NL*
kind
of
existence
,
which
sets
and
keeps
the
nostrils
dreaming
when
one
*NL*
goes
into
a
disused
gun-room
.
But
for
some
years
now
I
had
not
gone
into
*NL*
my
uncle
Adolphe
's
room
,
since
he
no
longer
came
to
Combray
on
account
*NL*
of
a
quarrel
which
had
arisen
between
him
and
my
family
,
by
my
fault
,
*NL*
and
in
the
following
circumstances
:
Once
or
twice
every
month
,
in
Paris
,
*NL*
I
used
to
be
sent
to
pay
him
a.
visit
,
as
he
was
finishing
his
luncheon
,
*NL*
wearing
a
plain
alpaca
coat
,
and
waited
upon
by
his
servant
in
a
*NL*
working-jacket
of
striped
linen
,
purple
and
white
.
He
would
complain
*NL*
that
I
had
not
been
to
see
him
for
a
long
time
;
that
he
was
being
*NL*
neglected
;
he
would
offer
me
a
marchpane
or
a
tangerine
,
and
we
would
*NL*
cross
a
room
in
which
no
one
ever
sat
,
whose
fire
was
never
lighted
,
*NL*
whose
walls
were
picked
out
with
gilded
mouldings
,
its
ceiling
painted
*NL*
blue
in
imitation
of
the
sky
,
and
its
furniture
upholstered
in
satin
,
as
*NL*
at
my
grandparents
'
,
only
yellow
;
then
we
would
enter
what
he
called
his
*NL*
`
study
,
'
a
room
whose
walls
were
hung
with
prints
which
shewed
,
against
*NL*
a
dark
background
,
a
plump
and
rosy
goddess
driving
a
car
,
or
standing
*NL*
upon
a
globe
,
or
wearing
a
star
on
her
brow
;
pictures
which
were
popular
*NL*
under
the
Second
Empire
because
there
was
thought
to
be
something
about
*NL*
them
that
suggested
Pompeii
,
which
were
then
generally
despised
,
and
*NL*
which
now
people
are
beginning
to
collect
again
for
one
single
and
*NL*
consistent
reason
-LRB-
despite
any
others
which
they
may
advance
-RRB-
,
namely
,
*NL*
that
they
suggest
the
Second
Empire
.
And
there
I
would
stay
with
my
*NL*
uncle
until
his
man
came
,
with
a
message
from
the
coachman
,
to
ask
him
*NL*
at
what
time
he
would
like
the
carriage
.
My
uncle
would
then
be
lost
*NL*
in
meditation
,
while
his
astonished
servant
stood
there
,
not
daring
to
*NL*
disturb
him
by
the
least
movement
,
wondering
and
waiting
for
his
*NL*
answer
,
which
never
varied
.
For
in
the
end
,
after
a
supreme
crisis
of
*NL*
hesitation
,
my
uncle
would
utter
,
infallibly
,
the
words
:
``
A
quarter
past
*NL*
two
,
''
which
the
servant
would
echo
with
amazement
,
but
without
disputing
*NL*
them
:
``
A
quarter
past
two
!
Very
good
,
sir
...
I
will
go
and
tell
him
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
date
I
was
a
lover
of
the
theatre
:
a
Platonic
lover
,
of
*NL*
necessity
,
since
my
parents
had
not
yet
allowed
me
to
enter
one
,
and
*NL*
so
incorrect
was
the
picture
I
drew
for
myself
of
the
pleasures
to
be
*NL*
enjoyed
there
that
I
almost
believed
that
each
of
the
spectators
looked
,
*NL*
as
into
a
stereoscope
,
upon
a
stage
and
scenery
which
existed
for
*NL*
himself
alone
,
though
closely
resembling
the
thousand
other
spectacles
*NL*
presented
to
the
rest
of
the
audience
individually
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
I
would
hasten
to
the
Moriss
column
to
see
what
new
plays
*NL*
it
announced
.
Nothing
could
be
more
disinterested
or
happier
than
the
*NL*
dreams
with
which
these
announcements
filled
my
mind
,
dreams
which
took
*NL*
their
form
from
the
inevitable
associations
of
the
words
forming
the
*NL*
title
of
the
play
,
and
also
from
the
colour
of
the
bills
,
still
damp
and
*NL*
wrinkled
with
paste
,
on
which
those
words
stood
out
.
Nothing
,
unless
*NL*
it
were
such
strange
titles
as
the
_
Testament
de
C√©sar
Girodot
,
or
*NL*
Oedipe-Roi
_
,
inscribed
not
on
the
green
bills
of
the
Op√©ra-Comique
,
but
*NL*
on
the
wine-coloured
bills
of
the
Com√©die-Fran√ßaise
,
nothing
seemed
*NL*
to
me
to
differ
more
profoundly
from
the
sparkling
white
plume
of
*NL*
the
_
Diamants
de
la
Couronne
_
than
the
sleek
,
mysterious
satin
of
the
*NL*
_
Domino
Noir
_
;
and
since
my
parents
had
told
me
that
,
for
my
first
visit
*NL*
to
the
theatre
,
I
should
have
to
choose
between
these
two
pieces
,
I
*NL*
would
study
exhaustively
and
in
turn
the
title
of
one
and
the
title
*NL*
of
the
other
-LRB-
for
those
were
all
that
I
knew
of
either
-RRB-
,
attempting
to
*NL*
snatch
from
each
a
foretaste
of
the
pleasure
which
it
offered
me
,
and
to
*NL*
compare
this
pleasure
with
that
latent
in
the
other
title
,
until
in
the
*NL*
end
I
had
shewn
myself
such
vivid
,
such
compelling
pictures
of
,
on
*NL*
the
one
hand
,
a
play
of
dazzling
arrogance
,
and
on
the
other
a
gentle
,
*NL*
velvety
play
,
that
I
was
as
little
capable
of
deciding
which
play
I
*NL*
should
prefer
to
see
as
if
,
at
the
dinner-table
,
they
had
obliged
me
to
*NL*
choose
between
_
rice
√†
l'Imp√©ratrice
_
and
the
famous
cream
of
chocolate
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
my
conversations
with
my
playfellows
bore
upon
actors
,
whose
art
,
*NL*
although
as
yet
I
had
no
experience
of
it
,
was
the
first
of
all
its
*NL*
numberless
forms
in
which
Art
itself
allowed
me
to
anticipate
its
*NL*
enjoyment
.
Between
one
actor
's
tricks
of
intonation
and
inflection
and
*NL*
another
's
,
the
most
trifling
differences
would
strike
me
as
being
of
an
*NL*
incalculable
importance
.
And
from
what
I
had
been
told
of
them
I
would
*NL*
arrange
them
in
the
order
of
their
talent
in
lists
which
I
used
to
*NL*
murmur
to
myself
all
day
long
:
lists
which
in
the
end
became
petrified
*NL*
in
my
brain
and
were
a
source
of
annoyance
to
it
,
being
irremovable
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
later
,
in
my
schooldays
,
whenever
I
ventured
in
class
,
when
the
*NL*
master
's
head
was
turned
,
to
communicate
with
some
new
friend
,
I
would
*NL*
always
begin
by
asking
him
whether
he
had
begun
yet
to
go
to
theatres
,
*NL*
and
if
he
agreed
that
our
greatest
actor
was
undoubtedly
Got
,
our
second
*NL*
Delaunay
,
and
so
on
.
And
if
,
in
his
judgment
,
Febvre
came
below
Thiron
,
*NL*
or
Delaunay
below
Coquelin
,
the
sudden
volatility
which
the
name
of
*NL*
Coquelin
,
forsaking
its
stony
rigidity
,
would
engender
in
my
mind
,
in
*NL*
which
it
moved
upwards
to
the
second
place
,
the
rich
vitality
with
which
*NL*
the
name
of
Delaunay
would
suddenly
be
furnished
,
to
enable
it
to
slip
*NL*
down
to
fourth
,
would
stimulate
and
fertilise
my
brain
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
bradding
and
blossoming
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
the
thought
of
actors
weighed
so
upon
me
,
if
the
sight
of
*NL*
Maubant
,
coming
out
one
afternoon
from
the
Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais
,
had
plunged
*NL*
me
in
the
throes
and
sufferings
of
hopeless
love
,
how
much
more
did
the
*NL*
name
of
a
`
star
,
'
blazing
outside
the
doors
of
a
theatre
,
how
much
more
,
*NL*
seen
through
the
window
of
a
brougham
which
passed
me
in
the
street
,
the
*NL*
hair
over
her
forehead
abloom
with
roses
,
did
the
face
of
a
woman
who
,
*NL*
I
would
think
,
was
perhaps
an
actress
,
leave
with
me
a
lasting
*NL*
disturbance
,
a
futile
and
painful
effort
to
form
a
picture
of
her
*NL*
private
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
classified
,
in
order
of
talent
,
the
most
distinguished
:
Sarah
*NL*
Bernhardt
,
Berma
,
Bartet
,
Madeleine
Brohan
,
Jeanne
Samary
;
but
I
was
*NL*
interested
in
them
all
.
Now
my
uncle
knew
many
of
them
personally
,
and
*NL*
also
ladies
of
another
class
,
not
clearly
distinguished
from
actresses
*NL*
in
my
mind
.
He
used
to
entertain
them
at
his
house
.
And
if
we
went
to
*NL*
see
him
on
certain
days
only
,
that
was
because
on
the
other
days
ladies
*NL*
might
come
whom
his
family
could
not
very
well
have
met
.
So
we
at
least
*NL*
thought
;
as
for
my
uncle
,
his
fatal
readiness
to
pay
pretty
widows
-LRB-
who
*NL*
had
perhaps
never
been
married
-RRB-
and
countesses
-LRB-
whose
high-sounding
*NL*
titles
were
probably
no
more
than
_
noms
de
guerre
_
-RRB-
the
compliment
of
*NL*
presenting
them
to
my
grandmother
or
even
of
presenting
to
them
some
*NL*
of
our
family
jewels
,
had
already
embroiled
him
more
than
once
with
*NL*
my
grandfather
.
Often
,
if
the
name
of
some
actress
were
mentioned
in
*NL*
conversation
,
I
would
hear
my
father
say
,
with
a
smile
,
to
my
mother
:
*NL*
``
One
of
your
uncle
's
friends
,
''
and
I
would
think
of
the
weary
novitiate
*NL*
through
which
,
perhaps
for
years
on
end
,
a
grown
man
,
even
a
man
of
real
*NL*
importance
,
might
have
to
pass
,
waiting
on
the
doorstep
of
some
such
*NL*
lady
,
while
she
refused
to
answer
his
letters
and
made
her
hall-porter
*NL*
drive
him
away
;
and
imagine
that
my
uncle
was
able
to
dispense
a
little
*NL*
jackanapes
like
myself
from
all
these
sufferings
by
introducing
me
in
*NL*
his
own
home
to
the
actress
,
unapproachable
by
all
the
world
,
but
for
*NL*
him
an
intimate
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
--
on
the
pretext
that
some
lesson
,
the
hour
of
which
had
been
*NL*
altered
,
now
came
at
such
an
awkward
time
that
it
had
already
more
than
*NL*
once
prevented
me
,
and
would
continue
to
prevent
me
,
from
seeing
my
*NL*
uncle
--
one
day
,
not
one
of
the
days
which
he
set
apart
for
our
visits
,
I
*NL*
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
my
parents
had
had
luncheon
earlier
*NL*
than
usual
;
I
slipped
out
and
,
instead
of
going
to
read
the
playbills
on
*NL*
their
column
,
for
which
purpose
I
was
allowed
to
go
out
unaccompanied
,
*NL*
I
ran
all
the
way
to
his
house
.
I
noticed
before
his
door
a
carriage
and
*NL*
pair
,
with
red
carnations
on
the
horses
'
blinkers
and
in
the
coachman
's
*NL*
buttonhole
.
As
I
climbed
the
staircase
I
could
hear
laughter
and
a
*NL*
woman
's
voice
,
and
,
as
soon
as
I
had
rung
,
silence
and
the
sound
of
*NL*
shutting
doors
.
The
man-servant
who
let
me
in
appeared
embarrassed
,
and
*NL*
said
that
my
uncle
was
extremely
busy
and
probably
could
not
see
me
;
he
*NL*
went
in
,
however
,
to
announce
my
arrival
,
and
the
same
voice
I
had
heard
*NL*
before
said
:
``
Oh
,
yes
!
Do
let
him
come
in
;
just
for
a
moment
;
it
will
be
*NL*
so
amusing
.
Is
that
his
photograph
there
,
on
your
desk
?
And
his
mother
*NL*
-LRB-
your
niece
,
is
n't
she
?
-RRB-
beside
it
?
The
image
of
her
,
is
n't
he
?
I
should
*NL*
so
like
to
see
the
little
chap
,
just
for
a
second
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hear
my
uncle
grumbling
and
growing
angry
;
finally
the
*NL*
manservant
told
me
to
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
table
was
the
same
plate
of
marchpanes
that
was
always
there
;
my
*NL*
uncle
wore
the
same
alpaca
coat
as
on
other
days
;
but
opposite
to
him
,
*NL*
in
a
pink
silk
dress
with
a
great
necklace
of
pearls
about
her
throat
,
*NL*
sat
a
young
woman
who
was
just
finishing
a
tangerine
.
My
uncertainty
*NL*
whether
I
ought
to
address
her
as
Madame
or
Mademoiselle
made
me
blush
,
*NL*
and
not
daring
to
look
too
much
in
her
direction
,
in
case
I
should
be
*NL*
obliged
to
speak
to
her
,
I
hurried
across
to
kiss
my
uncle
.
She
looked
*NL*
at
me
and
smiled
;
my
uncle
said
``
My
nephew
!
''
without
telling
her
my
name
*NL*
or
telling
me
hers
,
doubtless
because
,
since
his
difficulties
with
*NL*
my
grandfather
,
he
had
endeavoured
as
far
as
possible
to
avoid
any
*NL*
association
of
his
family
with
this
other
class
of
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
like
his
mother
he
is
,
''
said
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
never
seen
my
niece
,
except
in
photographs
,
''
my
uncle
*NL*
broke
in
quickly
,
with
a
note
of
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
dear
friend
,
I
passed
her
on
the
staircase
last
year
*NL*
when
you
were
so
ill
.
It
is
true
I
only
saw
her
for
a
moment
,
and
your
*NL*
staircase
is
rather
dark
;
but
I
saw
well
enough
to
see
how
lovely
she
*NL*
was
.
This
young
gentleman
has
her
beautiful
eyes
,
and
also
this
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
,
tracing
a
line
with
one
finger
across
the
lower
part
of
her
*NL*
forehead
.
``
Tell
me
,
''
she
asked
my
uncle
,
``
is
your
niece
Mme.
--
;
is
her
*NL*
name
the
same
as
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
takes
most
after
his
father
,
''
muttered
my
uncle
,
who
was
no
more
*NL*
anxious
to
effect
an
introduction
by
proxy
,
in
repeating
Mamma
's
name
*NL*
aloud
,
than
to
bring
the
two
together
in
the
flesh
.
``
He
's
his
father
all
*NL*
over
,
and
also
like
my
poor
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
met
his
father
,
dear
,
''
said
the
lady
in
pink
,
bowing
her
*NL*
head
slightly
,
``
and
I
never
saw
your
poor
mother
.
You
will
remember
it
*NL*
was
just
after
your
great
sorrow
that
we
got
to
know
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
somewhat
disillusioned
,
for
this
young
lady
was
in
no
way
*NL*
different
from
other
pretty
women
whom
I
had
seen
from
time
to
time
at
*NL*
home
,
especially
the
daughter
of
one
of
our
cousins
,
to
whose
house
I
*NL*
went
every
New
Year
's
Day
.
Only
better
dressed
;
otherwise
my
uncle
's
*NL*
friend
had
the
same
quick
and
kindly
glance
,
the
same
frank
and
friendly
*NL*
manner
.
I
could
find
no
trace
in
her
of
the
theatrical
appearance
*NL*
which
I
admired
in
photographs
of
actresses
,
nothing
of
the
diabolical
*NL*
expression
which
would
have
been
in
keeping
with
the
life
she
must
lead
.
*NL*
I
had
difficulty
in
believing
that
this
was
one
of
`
those
women
,
'
and
*NL*
certainly
I
should
never
have
believed
her
one
of
the
`
smart
ones
'
had
I
*NL*
not
seen
the
carriage
and
pair
,
the
pink
dress
,
the
pearly
necklace
,
had
*NL*
I
not
been
aware
,
too
,
that
my
uncle
knew
only
the
very
best
of
them
.
*NL*
But
I
asked
myself
how
the
millionaire
who
gave
her
her
carriage
and
her
*NL*
flat
and
her
jewels
could
find
any
pleasure
in
flinging
his
money
away
*NL*
upon
a
woman
who
had
so
simple
and
respectable
an
appearance
.
And
yet
,
*NL*
when
I
thought
of
what
her
life
must
be
like
,
its
immorality
disturbed
*NL*
me
more
,
perhaps
,
than
if
it
had
stood
before
me
in
some
concrete
and
*NL*
recognisable
form
,
by
its
secrecy
and
invisibility
,
like
the
plot
of
a
*NL*
novel
,
the
hidden
truth
of
a
scandal
which
had
driven
out
of
the
home
*NL*
of
her
middle-class
parents
and
dedicated
to
the
service
of
all
mankind
*NL*
which
had
brought
to
the
flowering-point
of
her
beauty
,
had
raised
*NL*
to
fame
or
notoriety
this
woman
,
the
play
of
whose
features
,
the
*NL*
intonations
of
whose
voice
,
like
so
many
others
I
already
knew
,
made
me
*NL*
regard
her
,
in
spite
of
myself
,
as
a
young
lady
of
good
family
,
her
who
*NL*
was
no
longer
of
a
family
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
gone
by
this
time
into
the
`
study
,
'
and
my
uncle
,
who
seemed
a
*NL*
trifle
embarrassed
by
my
presence
,
offered
her
a
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
dear
friend
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
know
I
only
smoke
the
ones
*NL*
the
Grand
Duke
sends
me
.
I
tell
him
that
they
make
you
jealous
.
''
And
*NL*
she
drew
from
a
case
cigarettes
covered
with
inscriptions
in
gold
,
in
*NL*
a
foreign
language
.
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
she
began
again
suddenly
.
``
Of
course
I
*NL*
have
met
this
young
man
's
father
with
you
.
Is
n't
he
your
nephew
?
How
on
*NL*
earth
could
I
have
forgotten
?
He
was
so
nice
,
so
charming
to
me
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
,
modestly
and
with
feeling
.
But
when
I
thought
to
myself
what
*NL*
must
actually
have
been
the
rude
greeting
-LRB-
which
,
she
made
out
,
had
been
*NL*
so
charming
-RRB-
,
I
,
who
knew
my
father
's
coldness
and
reserve
,
was
shocked
,
*NL*
as
though
at
some
indelicacy
on
his
part
,
at
the
contrast
between
the
*NL*
excessive
recognition
bestowed
on
it
and
his
never
adequate
geniality
.
*NL*
It
has
since
struck
me
as
one
of
the
most
touching
aspects
of
the
part
*NL*
played
in
life
by
these
idle
,
painstaking
women
that
they
devote
*NL*
all
their
generosity
,
all
their
talent
,
their
transferable
dreams
of
*NL*
sentimental
beauty
-LRB-
for
,
like
all
artists
,
they
never
seek
to
realise
*NL*
the
value
of
those
dreams
,
or
to
enclose
them
in
the
four-square
frame
*NL*
of
everyday
life
-RRB-
,
and
their
gold
,
which
counts
for
little
,
to
the
*NL*
fashioning
of
a
fine
and
precious
setting
for
the
rubbed
and
scratched
*NL*
and
ill-polished
lives
of
men
.
And
just
as
this
one
filled
the
*NL*
smoking-room
,
where
my
uncle
was
entertaining
her
in
his
alpaca
coat
,
*NL*
with
her
charming
person
,
her
dress
of
pink
silk
,
her
pearls
,
and
the
*NL*
refinement
suggested
by
intimacy
with
a
Grand
Duke
,
so
,
in
the
same
*NL*
way
,
she
had
taken
some
casual
remark
by
my
father
,
had
worked
it
up
*NL*
delicately
,
given
it
a
`
turn
,
'
a
precious
title
,
set
in
it
the
gem
of
a
*NL*
glance
from
her
own
eyes
,
a
gem
of
the
first
water
,
blended
of
humility
*NL*
and
gratitude
;
and
so
had
given
it
back
transformed
into
a
jewel
,
a
work
*NL*
of
art
,
into
something
altogether
charming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
my
boy
,
it
is
time
you
went
away
,
''
said
my
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
;
I
could
scarcely
resist
a
desire
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
lady
*NL*
in
pink
,
but
I
felt
that
to
do
so
would
require
as
much
audacity
as
a
*NL*
forcible
abduction
of
her
.
My
heart
beat
loud
while
I
counted
out
to
*NL*
myself
``
Shall
I
do
it
,
shall
I
not
?
''
and
then
I
ceased
to
ask
myself
*NL*
what
I
ought
to
do
so
as
at
least
to
do
something
.
Blindly
,
hotly
,
*NL*
madly
,
flinging
aside
all
the
reasons
I
had
just
found
to
support
such
*NL*
action
,
I
seized
and
raised
to
my
lips
the
hand
she
held
out
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
he
delicious
!
Quite
a
ladies
'
man
already
;
he
takes
after
his
*NL*
uncle
.
He
'll
be
a
perfect
`
gentleman
,
'
''
she
went
on
,
setting
her
teeth
*NL*
so
as
to
give
the
word
a
kind
of
English
accentuation
.
``
Could
n't
he
come
*NL*
to
me
some
day
for
'
a
cup
of
tea
,
'
as
our
friends
across
the
channel
*NL*
say
;
he
need
only
send
me
a
`
blue
'
in
the
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
the
least
idea
of
what
a
`
blue
'
might
be
.
I
did
not
understand
*NL*
half
the
words
which
the
lady
used
,
but
my
fear
lest
there
should
be
*NL*
concealed
in
them
some
question
which
it
would
be
impolite
in
me
not
to
*NL*
answer
kept
me
from
withdrawing
my
close
attention
from
them
,
and
I
was
*NL*
beginning
to
feel
extremely
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
it
is
impossible
,
''
said
my
uncle
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
``
He
*NL*
is
kept
busy
at
home
all
day
;
he
has
plenty
of
work
to
do
.
He
brings
*NL*
back
all
the
prizes
from
his
school
,
''
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
,
so
that
*NL*
I
should
not
hear
this
falsehood
and
interrupt
with
a
contradiction
.
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
tell
;
he
may
turn
out
a
little
Victor
Hugo
,
a
kind
of
*NL*
Vaulabelle
,
do
n't
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
love
artistic
people
,
''
replied
the
lady
in
pink
;
``
there
is
no
*NL*
one
like
them
for
understanding
women
.
Them
,
and
really
nice
men
like
*NL*
yourself
.
But
please
forgive
my
ignorance
.
Who
,
what
is
Vaulabelle
?
Is
*NL*
it
those
gilt
books
in
the
little
glass
case
in
your
drawing-room
?
You
*NL*
know
you
promised
to
lend
them
to
me
;
I
will
take
great
care
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
,
who
hated
lending
people
books
,
said
nothing
,
and
ushered
me
*NL*
out
into
the
hall
.
Madly
in
love
with
the
lady
in
pink
,
I
covered
my
*NL*
old
uncle
's
tobacco-stained
cheeks
with
passionate
kisses
,
and
while
he
,
*NL*
awkwardly
enough
,
gave
me
to
understand
-LRB-
without
actually
saying
-RRB-
that
*NL*
he
would
rather
I
did
not
tell
my
parents
about
this
visit
,
I
assured
*NL*
him
,
with
tears
in
my
eyes
,
that
his
kindness
had
made
so
strong
an
*NL*
impression
upon
me
that
some
day
I
would
most
certainly
find
a
way
of
*NL*
expressing
my
gratitude
.
So
strong
an
impression
had
it
made
upon
me
*NL*
that
two
hours
later
,
after
a
string
of
mysterious
utterances
which
did
*NL*
not
strike
me
as
giving
my
parents
a
sufficiently
clear
idea
of
the
new
*NL*
importance
with
which
I
had
been
invested
,
I
found
it
simpler
to
let
*NL*
them
have
a
full
account
,
omitting
no
detail
,
of
the
visit
I
had
paid
*NL*
that
afternoon
.
In
doing
this
I
had
no
thought
of
causing
my
uncle
any
*NL*
unpleasantness
.
How
could
I
have
thought
such
a
thing
,
since
I
did
not
*NL*
wish
it
?
And
I
could
not
suppose
that
my
parents
would
see
any
harm
in
*NL*
a
visit
in
which
I
myself
saw
none
.
Every
day
of
our
lives
does
not
*NL*
some
friend
or
other
ask
us
to
make
his
apologies
,
without
fail
,
to
some
*NL*
woman
to
whom
he
has
been
prevented
from
writing
;
and
do
not
we
forget
*NL*
to
do
so
,
feeling
that
this
woman
can
not
attach
much
importance
to
a
*NL*
silence
which
has
none
for
ourselves
?
I
imagined
,
like
everyone
else
,
*NL*
that
the
brains
of
other
people
were
lifeless
and
submissive
receptacles
*NL*
with
no
power
of
specific
reaction
to
any
stimulus
which
might
be
*NL*
applied
to
them
;
and
I
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
when
I
deposited
in
*NL*
the
minds
of
my
parents
the
news
of
the
acquaintance
I
had
made
at
my
*NL*
uncle
's
I
should
at
the
same
time
transmit
to
them
the
kindly
judgment
*NL*
I
myself
had
based
on
the
introduction
.
Unfortunately
my
parents
had
*NL*
recourse
to
principles
entirely
different
from
those
which
I
suggested
*NL*
they
should
adopt
when
they
came
to
form
their
estimate
of
my
uncle
's
*NL*
conduct
.
My
father
and
grandfather
had
`
words
'
with
him
of
a
violent
*NL*
order
;
as
I
learned
indirectly
.
A
few
days
later
,
passing
my
uncle
in
*NL*
the
street
as
he
drove
by
in
an
open
carriage
,
√é
felt
at
once
all
the
*NL*
grief
,
the
gratitude
,
the
remorse
which
I
should
have
liked
to
convey
to
*NL*
him
.
Beside
the
immensity
of
these
emotions
I
considered
that
merely
to
*NL*
raise
my
hat
to
him
would
be
incongruous
and
petty
,
and
might
make
*NL*
him
think
that
I
regarded
myself
as
bound
to
shew
him
no
more
than
the
*NL*
commonest
form
of
courtesy
.
I
decided
to
abstain
from
so
inadequate
a
*NL*
gesture
,
and
turned
my
head
away
.
My
uncle
thought
that
,
in
doing
so
I
*NL*
was
obeying
my
parents
'
orders
;
he
never
forgave
them
;
and
though
he
*NL*
did
not
die
until
many
years
later
,
not
one
of
us
ever
set
eyes
on
him
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
I
no
longer
used
to
go
into
the
little
sitting-room
-LRB-
now
kept
*NL*
shut
-RRB-
of
my
uncle
Adolphe
;
instead
,
after
hanging
about
on
the
outskirts
*NL*
of
the
back-kitchen
until
Fran√ßoise
appeared
on
its
threshold
and
*NL*
announced
:
``
I
am
going
to
let
the
kitchen-maid
serve
the
coffee
and
take
*NL*
up
the
hot
water
;
it
is
time
I
went
off
to
Mme.
Octave
,
''
I
would
then
*NL*
decide
to
go
indoors
,
and
would
go
straight
upstairs
to
my
room
to
read
.
*NL*
The
kitchen-maid
was
an
abstract
personality
,
a
permanent
institution
*NL*
to
which
an
invariable
set
of
attributes
assured
a
sort
of
fixity
and
*NL*
continuity
and
identity
throughout
the
long
series
of
transitory
human
*NL*
shapes
in
which
that
personality
was
incarnate
;
for
we
never
found
the
*NL*
same
girl
there
two
years
running
.
In
the
year
in
which
we
ate
such
*NL*
quantities
of
asparagus
,
the
kitchen-maid
whose
duty
it
was
to
dress
*NL*
them
was
a
poor
sickly
creature
,
some
way
`
gone
'
in
pregnancy
when
*NL*
we
arrived
at
Combray
for
Easter
,
and
it
was
indeed
surprising
that
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
allowed
her
to
run
so
many
errands
in
the
town
and
to
do
so
*NL*
much
work
in
the
house
,
for
she
was
beginning
to
find
a
difficulty
in
*NL*
bearing
before
her
the
mysterious
casket
,
fuller
and
larger
every
day
,
*NL*
whose
splendid
outline
could
be
detected
through
the
folds
of
her
ample
*NL*
smocks
.
These
last
recalled
the
cloaks
in
which
Giotto
shrouds
some
of
*NL*
the
allegorical
figures
in
his
paintings
,
of
which
M.
Swann
had
given
*NL*
me
photographs
.
He
it
was
who
pointed
out
the
resemblance
,
and
when
he
*NL*
inquired
after
the
kitchen-maid
he
would
say
:
``
Well
,
how
goes
it
with
*NL*
Giotto
's
Charity
?
''
And
indeed
the
poor
girl
,
whose
pregnancy
had
swelled
*NL*
and
stoutened
every
part
of
her
,
even
to
her
face
,
and
the
vertical
,
*NL*
squared
outlines
of
her
cheeks
,
did
distinctly
suggest
those
virgins
,
*NL*
so
strong
and
mannish
as
to
seem
matrons
rather
,
in
whom
the
Virtues
are
*NL*
personified
in
the
Arena
Chapel
.
And
I
can
see
now
that
those
Virtues
*NL*
and
Vices
of
Padua
resembled
her
in
another
respect
as
well
.
For
just
as
*NL*
the
figure
of
this
girl
had
been
enlarged
by
the
additional
symbol
which
*NL*
she
carried
in
her
body
,
without
appearing
to
understand
what
it
meant
,
*NL*
without
any
rendering
in
her
facial
expression
of
all
its
beauty
and
*NL*
spiritual
significance
,
but
carried
as
if
it
were
an
ordinary
and
rather
*NL*
heavy
burden
,
so
it
is
without
any
apparent
suspicion
of
what
she
is
*NL*
about
that
the
powerfully
built
housewife
who
is
portrayed
in
the
Arena
*NL*
beneath
the
label
`
Caritas
,
'
and
a
reproduction
of
whose
portrait
hung
*NL*
upon
the
wall
of
my
schoolroom
at
Combray
,
incarnates
that
virtue
,
for
*NL*
it
seems
impossible
,
that
any
thought
of
charity
can
ever
have
found
*NL*
expression
in
her
vulgar
and
energetic
face
.
By
a
fine
stroke
of
the
*NL*
painter
's
invention
she
is
tumbling
all
the
treasures
of
the
earth
at
*NL*
her
feet
,
but
exactly
as
if
she
were
treading
grapes
in
a
wine-press
to
*NL*
extract
their
juice
,
or
,
still
more
,
as
if
she
had
climbed
on
a
heap
of
*NL*
sacks
to
raise
herself
higher
;
and
she
is
holding
out
her
flaming
heart
*NL*
to
God
,
or
shall
we
say
`
handing
'
it
to
Him
,
exactly
as
a
cook
might
*NL*
hand
up
a
corkscrew
through
the
skylight
of
her
underground
kitchen
to
*NL*
some
one
who
had
called
down
to
ask
her
for
it
from
the
ground-level
*NL*
above
.
The
`
Invidia
,
'
again
,
should
have
had
some
look
on
her
face
of
*NL*
envy
.
But
in
this
fresco
,
too
,
the
symbol
occupies
so
large
a
place
and
*NL*
is
represented
with
such
realism
;
the
serpent
hissing
between
the
lips
*NL*
of
Envy
is
so
huge
,
and
so
completely
fills
her
wide-opened
mouth
that
*NL*
the
muscles
of
her
face
are
strained
and
contorted
,
like
a
child
's
who
*NL*
is
filling
a
balloon
with
his
breath
,
and
that
Envy
,
and
we
ourselves
*NL*
for
that
matter
,
when
we
look
at
her
,
since
all
her
attention
and
ours
*NL*
are
concentrated
on
the
action
of
her
lips
,
have
no
time
,
almost
,
to
*NL*
spare
for
envious
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
all
the
admiration
that
M.
Swann
might
profess
for
these
figures
*NL*
of
Giotto
,
it
was
a
long
time
before
I
could
find
any
pleasure
in
seeing
*NL*
in
our
schoolroom
-LRB-
where
the
copies
he
had
brought
me
were
hung
-RRB-
that
*NL*
Charity
devoid
of
charity
,
that
Envy
who
looked
like
nothing
so
much
*NL*
as
a
plate
in
some
medical
book
,
illustrating
the
compression
of
the
*NL*
glottis
or
uvula
by
a
tumour
in
the
tongue
,
or
by
the
introduction
of
*NL*
the
operator
's
instrument
,
a
Justice
whose
greyish
and
meanly
regular
*NL*
features
were
the
very
same
as
those
which
adorned
the
faces
of
certain
*NL*
good
and
pious
and
slightly
withered
ladies
of
Combray
whom
I
used
to
*NL*
see
at
mass
,
many
of
whom
had
long
been
enrolled
in
the
reserve
forces
*NL*
of
Injustice
.
But
in
later
years
I
understood
that
the
arresting
*NL*
strangeness
,
the
special
beauty
of
these
frescoes
lay
in
the
great
part
*NL*
played
in
each
of
them
by
its
symbols
,
while
the
fact
that
these
*NL*
were
depicted
,
not
as
symbols
-LRB-
for
the
thought
symbolised
was
nowhere
*NL*
expressed
-RRB-
,
but
as
real
things
,
actually
felt
or
materially
handled
,
*NL*
added
something
more
precise
and
more
literal
to
their
meaning
,
*NL*
something
more
concrete
and
more
striking
to
the
lesson
they
imparted
.
*NL*
And
even
in
the
case
of
the
poor
kitchen-maid
,
was
not
our
attention
*NL*
incessantly
drawn
to
her
belly
by
the
load
which
filled
it
;
and
in
the
*NL*
same
way
,
again
,
are
not
the
thoughts
of
men
and
women
in
the
agony
of
*NL*
death
often
turned
towards
the
practical
,
painful
,
obscure
,
internal
,
*NL*
intestinal
aspect
,
towards
that
`
seamy
side
'
of
death
which
is
,
as
it
*NL*
happens
,
the
side
that
death
actually
presents
to
them
and
forces
them
*NL*
to
feel
,
a
side
which
far
more
closely
resembles
a
crushing
burden
,
a
*NL*
difficulty
in
breathing
,
a
destroying
thirst
,
than
the
abstract
idea
to
*NL*
which
we
are
accustomed
to
give
the
name
of
Death
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
must
have
been
a
strong
element
of
reality
in
those
Virtues
and
*NL*
Vices
of
Padua
,
since
they
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
much
alive
as
*NL*
the
pregnant
servant-girl
,
while
she
herself
appeared
scarcely
less
*NL*
allegorical
than
they
.
And
,
quite
possibly
,
this
lack
-LRB-
or
seeming
lack
-RRB-
*NL*
of
participation
by
a
person
's
soul
in
the
significant
marks
of
its
own
*NL*
special
virtue
has
,
apart
from
its
aesthetic
meaning
,
a
reality
which
,
*NL*
if
not
strictly
psychological
,
may
at
least
be
called
physiognomical
.
*NL*
Later
on
,
when
,
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
I
have
had
occasion
to
meet
*NL*
with
,
in
convents
for
instance
,
literally
saintly
examples
of
practical
*NL*
charity
,
they
have
generally
had
the
brisk
,
decided
,
undisturbed
,
and
*NL*
slightly
brutal
air
of
a
busy
surgeon
,
the
face
in
which
one
can
discern
*NL*
no
commiseration
,
no
tenderness
at
the
sight
of
suffering
humanity
,
and
*NL*
no
fear
of
hurting
it
,
the
face
devoid
of
gentleness
or
sympathy
,
the
*NL*
sublime
face
of
true
goodness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
while
the
kitchen-maid
--
who
,
all
unawares
,
made
the
superior
*NL*
qualities
of
Fran√ßoise
shine
with
added
lustre
,
just
as
Error
,
by
*NL*
force
of
contrast
,
enhances
the
triumph
of
Truth
--
took
in
coffee
which
*NL*
-LRB-
according
to
Mamma
-RRB-
was
nothing
more
than
hot
water
,
and
then
carried
*NL*
up
to
our
rooms
hot
water
which
was
barely
tepid
,
I
would
be
lying
*NL*
stretched
out
on
my
bed
,
a
book
in
my
hand
,
in
my
room
which
trembled
*NL*
with
the
effort
to
defend
its
frail
,
transparent
coolness
against
the
*NL*
afternoon
sun
,
behind
its
almost
closed
shutters
through
which
,
however
,
*NL*
a
reflection
of
the
sunlight
had
contrived
to
slip
in
on
its
golden
*NL*
wings
,
remaining
motionless
,
between
glass
and
woodwork
,
in
a
corner
,
*NL*
like
a
butterfly
poised
upon
a
flower
.
It
was
hardly
light
enough
for
*NL*
me
to
read
,
and
my
feeling
of
the
day
's
brightness
and
splendour
was
*NL*
derived
solely
from
the
blows
struck
down
below
,
in
the
Rue
de
la
Cur√©
,
*NL*
by
Camus
-LRB-
whom
Fran√ßoise
had
assured
that
my
aunt
was
not
`
resting
'
and
*NL*
that
he
might
therefore
make
a
noise
-RRB-
,
upon
some
old
packing-cases
from
*NL*
which
nothing
would
really
be
sent
flying
but
the
dust
,
though
the
din
*NL*
of
them
,
in
the
resonant
atmosphere
that
accompanies
hot
weather
,
seemed
*NL*
to
scatter
broadcast
a
rain
of
blood-red
stars
;
and
from
the
flies
who
*NL*
performed
for
my
benefit
,
in
their
small
concert
,
as
it
might
be
the
*NL*
chamber
music
of
summer
;
evoking
heat
and
light
quite
differently
from
*NL*
an
air
of
human
music
which
,
if
you
happen
to
have
heard
it
during
a
*NL*
fine
summer
,
will
always
bring
that
summer
back
to
your
mind
,
the
flies
'
*NL*
music
is
bound
to
the
season
by
a
closer
,
a
more
vital
tie
--
born
of
*NL*
sunny
days
,
and
not
to
be
reborn
but
with
them
,
containing
something
*NL*
of
their
essential
nature
,
it
not
merely
calls
up
their
image
in
our
*NL*
memory
,
but
gives
us
a
guarantee
that
they
do
really
exist
,
that
they
*NL*
are
close
around
us
,
immediately
accessible
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dim
freshness
of
my
room
was
to
the
broad
daylight
of
the
street
*NL*
what
the
shadow
is
to
the
sunbeam
,
that
is
to
say
,
equally
luminous
,
*NL*
and
presented
to
my
imagination
the
entire
panorama
of
summer
,
which
*NL*
my
senses
,
if
I
had
been
out
walking
,
could
have
tasted
and
enjoyed
in
*NL*
fragments
only
;
and
so
was
quite
in
harmony
with
my
state
of
repose
,
*NL*
which
-LRB-
thanks
to
the
adventures
related
in
my
books
,
which
had
just
*NL*
excited
it
-RRB-
bore
,
like
a
hand
reposing
motionless
in
a
stream
of
running
*NL*
water
,
the
shock
and
animation
of
a
torrent
of
activity
and
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
grandmother
,
even
if
the
weather
,
after
growing
too
hot
,
had
*NL*
broken
,
and
a
storm
,
or
just
a
shower
,
had
burst
over
us
,
would
come
up
*NL*
and
beg
me
to
go
outside
.
And
as
I
did
not
wish
to
leave
off
my
book
,
I
*NL*
would
go
on
with
it
in
the
garden
,
under
the
chestnut-tree
,
in
a
little
*NL*
sentry-box
of
canvas
and
matting
,
in
the
farthest
recesses
of
which
I
*NL*
used
to
sit
and
feel
that
I
was
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
anyone
who
might
*NL*
be
coming
to
call
upon
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
my
thoughts
,
did
not
they
form
a
similar
sort
of
hiding-hole
,
*NL*
in
the
depths
of
which
I
felt
that
I
could
bury
myself
and
remain
*NL*
invisible
even
when
I
was
looking
at
what
went
on
outside
?
When
I
saw
*NL*
any
external
object
,
my
consciousness
that
I
was
seeing
it
would
remain
*NL*
between
me
and
it
,
enclosing
it
in
a
slender
,
incorporeal
outline
which
*NL*
prevented
me
from
ever
coming
directly
in
contact
with
the
material
*NL*
form
;
for
it
would
volatilise
itself
in
some
way
before
I
could
touch
*NL*
it
,
just
as
an
incandescent
body
which
is
moved
towards
something
wet
*NL*
never
actually
touches
moisture
,
since
it
is
always
preceded
,
itself
,
by
*NL*
a
zone
of
evaporation
.
Upon
the
sort
of
screen
,
patterned
with
different
*NL*
states
and
impressions
,
which
my
consciousness
would
quietly
unfold
*NL*
while
I
was
reading
,
and
which
ranged
from
the
most
deeply
hidden
*NL*
aspirations
of
my
heart
to
the
wholly
external
view
of
the
horizon
*NL*
spread
out
before
my
eyes
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
,
what
was
from
the
*NL*
first
the
most
permanent
and
the
most
intimate
part
of
me
,
the
lever
*NL*
whose
incessant
movements
controlled
all
the
rest
,
was
my
belief
in
the
*NL*
philosophic
richness
and
beauty
of
the
book
I
was
reading
,
and
my
desire
*NL*
to
appropriate
these
to
myself
,
whatever
the
book
might
be
.
For
even
if
*NL*
I
had
purchased
it
at
Combray
,
having
seen
it
outside
Borange
's
,
whose
*NL*
grocery
lay
too
far
from
our
house
for
Fran√ßoise
to
be
able
to
deal
*NL*
there
,
as
she
did
with
Camus
,
but
who
enjoyed
better
custom
as
a
*NL*
stationer
and
bookseller
;
even
if
I
had
seen
it
,
tied
with
string
to
*NL*
keep
it
in
its
place
in
the
mosaic
of
monthly
parts
and
pamphlets
which
*NL*
adorned
either
side
of
his
doorway
,
a
doorway
more
mysterious
,
more
*NL*
teeming
with
suggestion
than
that
of
a
cathedral
,
I
should
have
noticed
*NL*
and
bought
it
there
simply
because
I
had
recognised
it
as
a
book
which
*NL*
had
been
well
spoken
of
,
in
my
hearing
,
by
the
school-master
or
the
*NL*
school-friend
who
,
at
that
particular
time
,
seemed
to
me
to
be
*NL*
entrusted
with
the
secret
of
Truth
and
Beauty
,
things
half-felt
by
me
,
*NL*
half-incomprehensible
,
the
full
understanding
of
which
was
the
vague
but
*NL*
permanent
object
of
my
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
to
this
central
belief
,
which
,
while
I
was
reading
,
would
be
*NL*
constantly
a
motion
from
my
inner
self
to
the
outer
world
,
towards
the
*NL*
discovery
of
Truth
,
came
the
emotions
aroused
in
me
by
the
action
in
*NL*
which
I
would
be
taking
part
,
for
these
afternoons
were
crammed
with
*NL*
more
dramatic
and
sensational
events
than
occur
,
often
,
in
a
whole
*NL*
lifetime
.
These
were
the
events
which
took
place
in
the
book
I
was
*NL*
reading
.
It
is
true
that
the
people
concerned
in
them
were
not
what
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
would
have
called
`
real
people
.
'
But
none
of
the
feelings
*NL*
which
the
joys
or
misfortunes
of
a
`
real
'
person
awaken
in
us
can
be
*NL*
awakened
except
through
a
mental
picture
of
those
joys
or
misfortunes
;
*NL*
and
the
ingenuity
of
the
first
novelist
lay
in
his
understanding
*NL*
that
,
as
the
picture
was
the
one
essential
element
in
the
complicated
*NL*
structure
of
our
emotions
,
so
that
simplification
of
it
which
consisted
*NL*
in
the
suppression
,
pure
and
simple
,
of
`
real
'
people
would
be
a
decided
*NL*
improvement
.
A
`
real
'
person
,
profoundly
as
we
may
sympathise
with
him
,
*NL*
is
in
a
great
measure
perceptible
only
through
our
senses
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
he
remains
opaque
,
offers
a
dead
weight
which
our
sensibilities
*NL*
have
not
the
strength
to
lift
.
If
some
misfortune
comes
to
him
,
it
is
*NL*
only
in
one
small
section
of
the
complete
idea
we
have
of
him
that
*NL*
we
are
capable
of
feeling
any
emotion
;
indeed
it
is
only
in
one
small
*NL*
section
of
the
complete
idea
he
has
of
himself
that
he
is
capable
of
*NL*
feeling
any
emotion
either
.
The
novelist
's
happy
discovery
was
to
think
*NL*
of
substituting
for
those
opaque
sections
,
impenetrable
by
the
human
*NL*
spirit
,
their
equivalent
in
immaterial
sections
,
things
,
that
is
,
which
*NL*
the
spirit
can
assimilate
to
itself
.
After
which
it
matters
not
that
the
*NL*
actions
,
the
feelings
of
this
new
order
of
creatures
appear
to
us
in
*NL*
the
guise
of
truth
,
since
we
have
made
them
our
own
,
since
it
is
in
*NL*
ourselves
that
they
are
happening
,
that
they
are
holding
in
thrall
,
*NL*
while
we
turn
over
,
feverishly
,
the
pages
of
the
book
,
our
quickened
*NL*
breath
and
staring
eyes
.
And
once
the
novelist
has
brought
us
to
that
*NL*
state
,
in
which
,
as
in
all
purely
mental
states
,
every
emotion
is
*NL*
multiplied
ten-fold
,
into
which
his
book
comes
to
disturb
us
as
might
*NL*
a
dream
,
but
a
dream
more
lucid
,
and
of
a
more
lasting
impression
than
*NL*
those
which
come
to
us
in
sleep
;
why
,
then
,
for
the
space
of
an
hour
*NL*
he
sets
free
within
us
all
the
joys
and
sorrows
in
the
world
,
a
few
of
*NL*
which
,
only
,
we
should
have
to
spend
years
of
our
actual
life
in
getting
*NL*
to
know
,
and
the
keenest
,
the
most
intense
of
which
would
never
have
*NL*
been
revealed
to
us
because
the
slow
course
of
their
development
stops
*NL*
our
perception
of
them
.
It
is
the
same
in
life
;
the
heart
changes
,
and
*NL*
that
is
our
worst
misfortune
;
but
we
learn
of
it
only
from
reading
or
by
*NL*
imagination
;
for
in
reality
its
alteration
,
like
that
of
certain
natural
*NL*
phenomena
,
is
so
gradual
that
,
even
if
we
are
able
to
distinguish
,
*NL*
successively
,
each
of
its
different
states
,
we
are
still
spared
the
*NL*
actual
sensation
of
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
to
,
but
distinctly
less
intimate
a
part
of
myself
than
this
human
*NL*
element
,
would
come
the
view
,
more
or
less
projected
before
my
eyes
,
*NL*
of
the
country
in
which
the
action
of
the
story
was
taking
place
,
which
*NL*
made
a
far
stronger
impression
on
my
mind
than
the
other
,
the
actual
*NL*
landscape
which
would
meet
my
eyes
when
I
raised
them
from
my
book
.
In
*NL*
this
way
,
for
two
consecutive
summers
I
used
to
sit
in
the
heat
of
our
*NL*
Combray
garden
,
sick
with
a
longing
inspired
by
the
book
I
was
then
*NL*
reading
for
a
land
of
mountains
and
rivers
,
where
I
could
see
an
endless
*NL*
vista
of
sawmills
,
where
beneath
the
limpid
currents
fragments
of
*NL*
wood
lay
mouldering
in
beds
of
watercress
;
and
nearby
,
rambling
and
*NL*
clustering
along
low
walls
,
purple
flowers
and
red
.
And
since
there
was
*NL*
always
lurking
in
my
mind
the
dream
of
a
woman
who
would
enrich
me
with
*NL*
her
love
,
that
dream
in
those
two
summers
used
to
be
quickened
with
the
*NL*
freshness
and
coolness
of
running
water
;
and
whoever
she
might
be
,
the
*NL*
woman
whose
image
I
called
to
mind
,
purple
flowers
and
red
would
at
once
*NL*
spring
up
on
either
side
of
her
like
complementary
colours
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
only
because
an
image
of
which
we
dream
remains
for
ever
*NL*
distinguished
,
is
adorned
and
enriched
by
the
association
of
colours
not
*NL*
its
own
which
may
happen
to
surround
it
in
our
mental
picture
;
for
the
*NL*
scenes
in
the
books
I
read
were
to
me
not
merely
scenery
more
vividly
*NL*
portrayed
by
my
imagination
than
any
which
Combray
could
spread
before
*NL*
my
eyes
but
otherwise
of
the
same
kind
.
Because
of
the
selection
that
*NL*
the
author
had
made
of
them
,
because
of
the
spirit
of
faith
in
which
*NL*
my
mind
would
exceed
and
anticipate
his
printed
word
,
as
it
might
*NL*
be
interpreting
a
revelation
,
these
scenes
used
to
give
me
the
*NL*
impression
--
one
which
I
hardly
ever
derived
from
any
place
in
which
*NL*
I
might
happen
to
be
,
and
never
from
our
garden
,
that
undistinguished
*NL*
product
of
the
strictly
conventional
fantasy
of
the
gardener
whom
my
*NL*
grandmother
so
despised
--
of
their
being
actually
part
of
Nature
herself
,
*NL*
and
worthy
to
be
studied
and
explored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
my
parents
allowed
me
,
when
I
read
a
book
,
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
*NL*
country
it
described
,
I
should
have
felt
that
I
was
making
an
enormous
*NL*
advance
towards
the
ultimate
conquest
of
truth
.
For
even
if
we
have
*NL*
the
sensation
of
being
always
enveloped
in
,
surrounded
by
our
own
soul
,
*NL*
still
it
does
not
seem
a
fixed
and
immovable
prison
;
rather
do
we
seem
*NL*
to
be
borne
away
with
it
,
and
perpetually
struggling
to
pass
beyond
it
,
*NL*
to
break
out
into
the
world
,
with
a
perpetual
discouragement
as
we
hear
*NL*
endlessly
,
all
around
us
,
that
unvarying
sound
which
is
no
echo
from
*NL*
without
,
but
the
resonance
of
a
vibration
from
within
.
We
try
to
*NL*
discover
in
things
,
endeared
to
us
on
that
account
,
the
spiritual
*NL*
glamour
which
we
ourselves
have
cast
upon
them
;
we
are
disillusioned
,
*NL*
and
learn
that
they
are
in
themselves
barren
and
devoid
of
the
charm
*NL*
which
they
owed
,
in
our
minds
,
to
the
association
of
certain
ideas
;
*NL*
sometimes
we
mobilise
all
our
spiritual
forces
in
a
glittering
array
so
*NL*
as
to
influence
and
subjugate
other
human
beings
who
,
as
we
very
well
*NL*
know
,
are
situated
outside
ourselves
,
where
we
can
never
reach
them
.
And
*NL*
so
,
if
I
always
imagined
the
woman
I
loved
as
in
a
setting
of
whatever
*NL*
places
I
most
longed
,
at
the
time
,
to
visit
;
if
in
my
secret
longings
*NL*
it
was
she
who
attracted
me
to
them
,
who
opened
to
me
the
gate
of
an
*NL*
unknown
world
,
that
was
not
by
the
mere
hazard
of
a
simple
association
*NL*
of
thoughts
;
no
,
it
was
because
my
dreams
of
travel
and
of
love
were
*NL*
only
moments
--
which
I
isolate
artificially
to-day
as
though
I
*NL*
were
cutting
sections
,
at
different
heights
,
in
a
jet
of
water
,
*NL*
rainbow-flashing
but
seemingly
without
flow
or
motion
--
were
only
drops
*NL*
in
a
single
,
undeviating
,
irresistible
outrush
of
all
the
forces
of
my
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
as
I
continue
to
trace
the
outward
course
of
these
impressions
*NL*
from
their
close-packed
intimate
source
in
my
consciousness
,
and
*NL*
before
I
come
to
the
horizon
of
reality
which
envelops
them
,
I
discover
*NL*
pleasures
of
another
kind
,
those
of
being
comfortably
seated
,
of
tasting
*NL*
the
good
scent
on
the
air
,
of
not
being
disturbed
by
any
visitor
;
and
,
*NL*
when
an
hour
chimed
from
the
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
,
of
watching
what
*NL*
was
already
spent
of
the
afternoon
fall
drop
by
drop
until
I
heard
the
*NL*
last
stroke
which
enabled
me
to
add
up
the
total
sum
,
after
which
the
*NL*
silence
that
followed
seemed
to
herald
the
beginning
,
in
the
blue
sky
*NL*
above
me
,
of
that
long
part
of
the
day
still
allowed
me
for
reading
,
*NL*
until
the
good
dinner
which
Fran√ßoise
was
even
now
preparing
should
come
*NL*
to
strengthen
and
refresh
me
after
the
strenuous
pursuit
of
its
hero
*NL*
through
the
pages
of
my
book
.
And
,
as
each
hour
struck
,
it
would
seem
to
*NL*
me
that
a
few
seconds
only
had
passed
since
the
hour
before
;
the
latest
*NL*
would
inscribe
itself
,
close
to
its
predecessor
,
on
the
sky
's
surface
,
*NL*
and
I
would
be
unable
to
believe
that
sixty
minutes
could
be
squeezed
*NL*
into
the
tiny
arc
of
blue
which
was
comprised
between
their
two
golden
*NL*
figures
.
Sometimes
it
would
even
happen
that
this
precocious
hour
would
*NL*
sound
two
strokes
more
than
the
last
;
there
must
then
have
been
an
hour
*NL*
which
I
had
not
heard
strike
;
something
which
had
taken
place
had
not
*NL*
taken
place
for
me
;
the
fascination
of
my
book
,
a
magic
as
potent
as
the
*NL*
deepest
slumber
,
had
stopped
my
enchanted
ears
and
had
obliterated
*NL*
the
sound
of
that
golden
bell
from
the
azure
surface
of
the
enveloping
*NL*
silence
.
Sweet
Sunday
afternoons
beneath
the
chestnut-tree
in
our
*NL*
Combray
garden
,
from
which
I
was
careful
to
eliminate
every
commonplace
*NL*
incident
of
my
actual
life
,
replacing
them
by
a
career
of
strange
*NL*
adventures
and
ambitions
in
a
land
watered
by
living
streams
,
you
still
*NL*
recall
those
adventures
and
ambitions
to
my
mind
when
I
think
of
you
,
*NL*
and
you
embody
and
preserve
them
by
virtue
of
having
little
by
little
*NL*
drawn
round
and
enclosed
them
-LRB-
while
I
went
on
with
my
book
and
the
heat
*NL*
of
the
day
declined
-RRB-
in
the
gradual
crystallisation
,
slowly
altering
*NL*
in
form
and
dappled
with
a
pattern
of
chestnut-leaves
,
of
your
silent
,
*NL*
sonorous
,
fragrant
,
limpid
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
I
would
be
torn
from
my
book
,
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
by
the
gardener
's
daughter
,
who
came
running
like
a
mad
thing
,
*NL*
overturning
an
orange-tree
in
its
tub
,
cutting
a
finger
,
breaking
a
*NL*
tooth
,
and
screaming
out
``
They
're
coming
,
they
're
coming
!
''
so
that
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
and
I
should
run
too
and
not
miss
anything
of
the
show
.
That
*NL*
was
on
days
when
the
cavalry
stationed
in
Combray
went
out
for
some
*NL*
military
exercise
,
going
as
a
rule
by
the
Rue
Sainte-Hildegarde
.
While
*NL*
our
servants
,
sitting
in
a
row
on
their
chairs
outside
the
garden
*NL*
railings
,
stared
at
the
people
of
Combray
taking
their
Sunday
walks
and
*NL*
were
stared
at
in
return
,
the
gardener
's
daughter
,
through
the
gap
which
*NL*
there
was
between
two
houses
far
away
in
the
Avenue
de
la
Gare
,
would
*NL*
have
spied
the
glitter
of
helmets
.
The
servants
then
hurried
in
*NL*
with
their
chairs
,
for
when
the
troopers
filed
through
the
Rue
*NL*
Sainte-Hildegarde
they
filled
it
from
side
to
side
,
and
their
jostling
*NL*
horses
scraped
against
the
walls
of
the
houses
,
covering
and
drowning
*NL*
the
pavements
like
banks
which
present
too
narrow
a
channel
to
a
river
*NL*
in
flood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
children
,
''
Fran√ßoise
would
exclaim
,
in
tears
almost
before
she
*NL*
had
reached
the
railings
;
``
poor
boys
,
to
be
mown
down
like
grass
in
a
*NL*
meadow
.
It
's
just
shocking
to
think
of
,
''
she
would
go
on
,
laying
a
hand
*NL*
over
her
heart
,
where
presumably
she
had
felt
the
shock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
sight
,
is
n't
it
,
Mme.
Fran√ßoise
,
all
these
young
fellows
not
*NL*
caring
two
straws
for
their
lives
?
''
the
gardener
would
ask
,
just
to
*NL*
`
draw
'
her
.
And
he
would
not
have
spoken
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
caring
for
their
lives
,
is
it
?
Why
,
what
in
the
world
is
there
that
*NL*
we
should
care
for
if
it
's
not
our
lives
,
the
only
gift
the
Lord
never
*NL*
offers
us
a
second
time
?
Oh
dear
,
oh
dear
;
you
're
right
all
the
same
;
*NL*
it
's
quite
true
,
they
do
n't
care
!
I
can
remember
them
in
'
70
;
in
those
*NL*
wretched
wars
they
've
no
fear
of
death
left
in
them
;
they
're
nothing
*NL*
more
nor
less
than
madmen
;
and
then
they
are
n't
worth
the
price
of
a
*NL*
rope
to
hang
them
with
;
they
're
not
men
any
more
,
they
're
lions
.
''
For
*NL*
by
her
way
of
thinking
,
to
compare
a
man
with
a
lion
,
which
she
used
to
*NL*
pronounce
`
lie-on
,
'
was
not
at
all
complimentary
to
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rue
Sainte-Hildegarde
turned
too
sharply
for
us
to
be
able
to
see
*NL*
people
approaching
at
any
distance
,
and
it
was
only
through
the
gap
*NL*
between
those
two
houses
in
the
Avenue
de
la
Gare
that
we
could
still
*NL*
make
out
fresh
helmets
racing
along
towards
us
,
and
flashing
in
the
*NL*
sunlight
.
The
gardener
wanted
to
know
whether
there
were
still
many
to
*NL*
come
,
and
he
was
thirsty
besides
,
with
the
sun
beating
down
upon
his
*NL*
head
.
So
then
,
suddenly
,
his
daughter
would
leap
out
,
as
though
from
*NL*
a
beleaguered
city
,
would
make
a
sortie
,
turn
the
street
corner
,
and
,
*NL*
having
risked
her
life
a
hundred
times
over
,
reappear
and
bring
us
,
*NL*
with
a
jug
of
liquorice-water
,
the
news
that
there
were
still
at
least
*NL*
a
thousand
of
them
,
pouring
along
without
a
break
from
the
direction
*NL*
of
Thiberzy
and
M√©s√©glise
.
Fran√ßoise
and
the
gardener
,
having
`
made
up
'
*NL*
their
difference
,
would
discuss
the
line
to
be
followed
in
case
of
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
,
Fran√ßoise
,
''
he
would
say
.
``
Revolution
would
be
better
,
*NL*
because
then
no
one
would
need
to
join
in
unless
he
liked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
can
see
that
,
certainly
;
it
's
more
straightforward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gardener
believed
that
,
as
soon
as
war
was
declared
,
they
would
stop
*NL*
all
the
railways
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
;
so
that
we
sha
'n'
t
get
away
,
''
said
Fran√ßoise
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
gardener
would
assent
,
with
``
Ay
,
they
're
the
cunning
ones
,
''
for
*NL*
he
would
not
allow
that
war
was
anything
but
a
kind
of
trick
which
the
*NL*
state
attempted
to
play
on
the
people
,
or
that
there
was
a
man
in
the
*NL*
world
who
would
not
run
away
from
it
if
he
had
the
chance
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fran√ßoise
would
hasten
back
to
my
aunt
,
and
I
would
return
to
my
*NL*
book
,
and
the
servants
would
take
their
places
again
outside
the
gate
to
*NL*
watch
the
dust
settle
on
the
pavement
,
and
the
excitement
caused
by
the
*NL*
passage
of
the
soldiers
subside
.
Long
after
order
had
been
restored
,
*NL*
an
abnormal
tide
of
humanity
would
continue
to
darken
the
streets
of
*NL*
Cormbray
.
And
in
front
of
every
house
,
even
of
those
where
it
was
not
,
*NL*
as
a
rule
,
`
done
,
'
the
servants
,
and
sometimes
even
the
masters
would
*NL*
sit
and
stare
,
festooning
their
doorsteps
with
a
dark
,
irregular
fringe
,
*NL*
like
the
border
of
shells
and
sea-weed
which
a
stronger
tide
than
usual
*NL*
leaves
on
the
beach
,
as
though
trimming
it
with
embroidered
crape
,
when
*NL*
the
sea
itself
has
retreated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Except
on
such
days
as
these
,
however
,
I
would
as
a
rule
be
left
to
read
*NL*
in
peace
.
But
the
interruption
which
a
visit
from
Swann
once
made
,
and
*NL*
the
commentary
which
he
then
supplied
to
the
course
of
my
reading
,
*NL*
which
had
brought
me
to
the
work
of
an
author
quite
new
to
me
,
called
*NL*
Bergotte
,
had
this
definite
result
that
for
a
long
time
afterwards
*NL*
it
was
not
against
a
wall
gay
with
spikes
of
purple
blossom
,
but
on
a
*NL*
wholly
different
background
,
the
porch
of
a
gothic
cathedral
,
that
I
*NL*
would
see
outlined
the
figure
of
one
of
the
women
of
whom
I
dreamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
heard
Bergotte
spoken
of
,
for
the
first
time
,
by
a
friend
older
*NL*
than
myself
,
for
whom
I
had
a
strong
admiration
,
a
precious
youth
of
the
*NL*
name
of
Bloch
.
Hearing
me
confess
my
love
of
the
_
Nuit
d'Octobre
_
,
he
*NL*
had
burst
out
in
a
bray
of
laughter
,
like
a
bugle-call
,
and
told
me
,
*NL*
by
way
of
warning
:
``
You
must
conquer
your
vile
taste
for
A.
de
Musset
,
*NL*
Esquire
.
He
is
a
bad
egg
,
one
of
the
very
worst
,
a
pretty
detestable
*NL*
specimen
.
I
am
bound
to
admit
,
natheless
,
''
he
added
graciously
,
``
that
*NL*
he
,
and
even
the
man
Racine
,
did
,
each
of
them
,
once
in
his
life
,
*NL*
compose
a
line
which
is
not
only
fairly
rhythmical
,
but
has
also
what
is
*NL*
in
my
eyes
the
supreme
merit
of
meaning
absolutely
nothing
.
One
is
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
La
blanche
Oloossone
et
la
blanche
Camire
_
,
*NL*
*NL*
and
the
other
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
La
fille
de
Minos
et
de
Pasipha√´
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
submitted
to
my
judgment
,
as
evidence
for
the
defence
of
the
*NL*
two
runagates
,
in
an
article
by
my
very
dear
master
Father
Lecomte
,
who
*NL*
is
found
pleasing
in
the
sight
of
the
immortal
gods
.
By
which
token
,
*NL*
here
is
a
book
which
I
have
not
the
time
,
just
now
,
to
read
,
a
book
*NL*
recommended
,
it
would
seem
,
by
that
colossal
fellow
.
He
regards
,
or
so
*NL*
they
tell
me
,
its
author
,
one
Bergotte
,
Esquire
,
as
a
subtle
scribe
,
*NL*
more
subtle
,
indeed
,
than
any
beast
of
the
field
;
and
,
albeit
he
*NL*
exhibits
on
occasion
a
critical
pacifism
,
a
tenderness
in
suffering
*NL*
fools
,
for
which
it
is
impossible
to
account
,
and
hard
to
make
*NL*
allowance
,
still
his
word
has
weight
with
me
as
it
were
the
Delphic
*NL*
Oracle
.
Read
you
then
this
lyrical
prose
,
and
,
if
the
Titanic
*NL*
master-builder
of
rhythm
who
composed
_
Bhagavat
_
and
the
_
L√©vrier
de
*NL*
Magnus
_
speaks
not
falsely
,
then
,
by
Apollo
,
you
may
taste
,
even
you
,
my
*NL*
master
,
the
ambrosial
joys
of
Olympus
.
''
It
was
in
an
ostensible
vein
of
*NL*
sarcasm
that
he
had
asked
me
to
call
him
,
and
that
he
himself
called
me
,
*NL*
``
my
master
.
''
But
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
we
each
derived
a
certain
amount
*NL*
of
satisfaction
from
the
mannerism
,
being
still
at
the
age
in
which
one
*NL*
believes
that
one
gives
a
thing
real
existence
by
giving
it
a
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
I
was
not
able
to
set
at
rest
,
by
further
talks
with
*NL*
Bloch
,
in
which
I
might
have
insisted
upon
an
explanation
,
the
doubts
*NL*
he
had
engendered
in
me
when
he
told
me
that
fine
lines
of
poetry
-LRB-
from
*NL*
which
I
,
if
you
please
,
expected
nothing
less
than
the
revelation
of
*NL*
truth
itself
-RRB-
were
all
the
finer
if
they
meant
absolutely
nothing
.
For
,
*NL*
as
it
happened
,
Bloch
was
not
invited
to
the
house
again
.
At
first
,
he
*NL*
had
been
well
received
there
.
It
is
true
that
my
grandfather
made
out
*NL*
that
,
whenever
I
formed
a
strong
attachment
to
any
one
of
my
friends
and
*NL*
brought
him
home
with
me
,
that
friend
was
invariably
a
Jew
;
to
which
he
*NL*
would
not
have
objected
on
principle
--
indeed
his
own
friend
Swann
was
*NL*
of
Jewish
extraction
--
had
he
not
found
that
the
Jews
whom
I
chose
as
*NL*
friends
were
not
usually
of
the
best
type
.
And
so
I
was
hardly
ever
able
*NL*
to
bring
a
new
friend
home
without
my
grandfather
's
humming
the
``
O
,
*NL*
God
of
our
fathers
''
from
_
La
Juive
_
,
or
else
``
Israel
,
break
thy
chain
,
''
*NL*
singing
the
tune
alone
,
of
course
,
to
an
``
um-ti-tum-ti-tum
,
tra-la
''
;
but
*NL*
I
used
to
be
afraid
of
my
friend
's
recognising
the
sound
,
and
so
being
*NL*
able
to
reconstruct
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
seeing
them
,
merely
on
hearing
their
names
,
about
which
,
as
often
*NL*
as
not
,
there
was
nothing
particularly
Hebraic
,
he
would
divine
not
only
*NL*
the
Jewish
origin
of
such
of
my
friends
as
might
indeed
be
of
the
chosen
*NL*
people
,
but
even
some
dark
secret
which
was
hidden
in
their
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
they
call
your
friend
who
is
coming
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dumont
,
grandpapa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dumont
!
Oh
,
I
'm
frightened
of
Dumont
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
would
sing
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Archers
,
be
on
your
guard
!
*NL*
Watch
without
rest
,
without
sound
,
*NL*
*NL*
and
then
,
after
a
few
adroit
questions
on
points
of
detail
,
he
would
*NL*
call
out
``
On
guard
!
on
guard
,
''
or
,
if
it
were
the
victim
himself
who
*NL*
had
already
arrived
,
and
had
been
obliged
,
unconsciously
,
by
my
*NL*
grandfather
's
subtle
examination
,
to
admit
his
origin
,
then
my
*NL*
grandfather
,
to
shew
us
that
he
had
no
longer
any
doubts
,
would
merely
*NL*
look
at
us
,
humming
almost
inaudibly
the
air
of
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
!
do
you
hither
guide
the
feet
*NL*
Of
this
timid
Israelite
?
*NL*
*NL*
or
of
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sweet
vale
of
Hebron
,
dear
paternal
fields
,
*NL*
*NL*
or
,
perhaps
,
of
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
I
am
of
the
chosen
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
little
eccentricities
on
my
grandfather
's
part
implied
no
ill-will
*NL*
whatsoever
towards
my
friends
.
But
Bloch
had
displeased
my
family
for
*NL*
other
reasons
.
He
had
begun
by
annoying
my
father
,
who
,
seeing
him
come
*NL*
in
with
wet
clothes
,
had
asked
him
with
keen
interest
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
M.
Bloch
,
is
there
a
change
in
the
weather
;
has
it
been
raining
?
I
*NL*
ca
n't
understand
it
;
the
barometer
has
been
`
set
fair
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
drew
from
Bloch
nothing
more
instructive
than
``
Sir
,
I
am
*NL*
absolutely
incapable
of
telling
you
whether
it
has
rained
.
I
live
so
*NL*
resolutely
apart
from
physical
contingencies
that
my
senses
no
longer
*NL*
trouble
to
inform
me
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
boy
,
''
said
my
father
after
Bloch
had
gone
,
``
your
friend
is
out
*NL*
of
his
mind
.
Why
,
he
could
n't
even
tell
me
what
the
weather
was
like
.
As
*NL*
if
there
could
be
anything
more
interesting
!
He
is
an
imbecile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
,
Bloch
had
displeased
my
grandmother
because
,
after
luncheon
,
when
*NL*
she
complained
of
not
feeling
very
well
,
he
had
stifled
a
sob
and
wiped
*NL*
the
tears
from
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
imagine
that
he
is
sincere
,
''
she
observed
to
me
.
``
Why
he
*NL*
does
n't
know
me
.
Unless
he
's
mad
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
finally
he
had
upset
the
whole
household
when
he
arrived
an
hour
*NL*
and
a
half
late
for
luncheon
and
covered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
,
and
*NL*
made
not
the
least
apology
,
saying
merely
:
``
I
never
allow
myself
to
be
*NL*
influenced
in
the
smallest
degree
either
by
atmospheric
disturbances
or
*NL*
by
the
arbitrary
divisions
of
what
is
known
as
Time
.
I
would
willingly
*NL*
reintroduce
to
society
the
opium
pipe
of
China
or
the
Malayan
kriss
,
but
*NL*
I
am
wholly
and
entirely
without
instruction
in
those
infinitely
more
*NL*
pernicious
-LRB-
besides
being
quite
bleakly
bourgeois
-RRB-
implements
,
the
*NL*
umbrella
and
the
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
this
he
would
still
have
been
received
at
Combray
.
He
*NL*
was
,
of
course
,
hardly
the
friend
my
parents
would
have
chosen
for
*NL*
me
;
they
had
,
in
the
end
,
decided
that
the
tears
which
he
had
shed
on
*NL*
hearing
of
my
grandmother
's
illness
were
genuine
enough
;
but
they
*NL*
knew
,
either
instinctively
or
from
their
own
experience
,
that
our
early
*NL*
impulsive
emotions
have
but
little
influence
over
our
later
actions
and
*NL*
the
conduct
of
our
lives
;
and
that
regard
for
moral
obligations
,
loyalty
*NL*
to
our
friends
,
patience
in
finishing
our
work
,
obedience
to
a
rule
*NL*
of
life
,
have
a
surer
foundation
in
habits
solidly
formed
and
blindly
*NL*
followed
than
in
these
momentary
transports
,
ardent
but
sterile
.
They
*NL*
would
have
preferred
to
Bloch
,
as
companions
for
myself
,
boys
who
would
*NL*
have
given
me
no
more
than
it
is
proper
,
by
all
the
laws
of
middle-class
*NL*
morality
,
for
boys
to
give
one
another
,
who
would
not
unexpectedly
*NL*
send
me
a
basket
of
fruit
because
they
happened
,
that
morning
,
to
have
*NL*
thought
of
me
with
affection
,
but
who
,
since
they
were
incapable
of
*NL*
inclining
in
my
favour
,
by
any
single
impulse
of
their
imagination
and
*NL*
emotions
,
the
exact
balance
of
the
duties
and
claims
of
friendship
,
were
*NL*
as
incapable
of
loading
the
scales
to
my
prejudice
.
Even
the
injuries
*NL*
we
do
them
will
not
easily
divert
from
the
path
of
their
duty
towards
us
*NL*
those
conventional
natures
of
which
my
great-aunt
furnished
a
type
:
who
,
*NL*
after
quarrelling
for
years
with
a
niece
,
to
whom
she
never
spoke
again
,
*NL*
yet
made
no
change
in
the
will
in
which
she
had
left
that
niece
the
*NL*
whole
of
her
fortune
,
because
she
was
her
next-of-kin
,
and
it
was
the
*NL*
`
proper
thing
'
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
fond
of
Bloch
;
my
parents
wished
me
to
be
happy
;
and
the
*NL*
insoluble
problems
which
I
set
myself
on
such
texts
as
the
`
absolutely
*NL*
meaningless
'
beauty
of
_
La
fille
de
Minos
et
de
Pasipha√´
_
tired
me
more
*NL*
and
made
me
more
unwell
than
I
should
have
been
after
further
talks
with
*NL*
him
,
unwholesome
as
those
talks
might
seem
to
my
mother
's
mind
.
And
he
*NL*
would
still
have
been
received
at
Combray
but
for
one
thing
.
That
same
*NL*
night
,
after
dinner
,
having
informed
me
-LRB-
a
piece
of
news
which
had
a
*NL*
great
influence
on
my
later
life
,
making
it
happier
at
one
time
and
then
*NL*
more
unhappy
-RRB-
that
no
woman
ever
thought
of
anything
but
love
,
and
that
*NL*
there
was
not
one
of
them
whose
resistance
a
man
could
not
overcome
,
*NL*
he
had
gone
on
to
assure
me
that
he
had
heard
it
said
on
unimpeachable
*NL*
authority
that
my
great-aunt
herself
had
led
a
`
gay
'
life
in
her
younger
*NL*
days
,
and
had
been
notoriously
`
kept
.
'
I
could
not
refrain
from
passing
*NL*
on
so
important
a
piece
of
information
to
my
parents
;
the
next
time
*NL*
Bloch
called
he
was
not
admitted
,
and
afterwards
,
when
I
met
him
in
the
*NL*
street
,
he
greeted
me
with
extreme
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
matter
of
Bergotte
he
had
spoken
truly
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
few
days
,
like
a
tune
which
will
be
running
in
one
's
head
*NL*
and
maddening
one
soon
enough
,
but
of
which
one
has
not
for
the
moment
*NL*
`
got
hold
,
'
the
things
I
was
to
love
so
passionately
in
Bergotte
's
style
*NL*
had
not
yet
caught
my
eye
.
I
could
not
,
it
is
true
,
lay
down
the
novel
*NL*
of
his
which
I
was
reading
,
but
I
fancied
that
I
was
interested
in
the
*NL*
story
alone
,
as
in
the
first
dawn
of
love
,
when
we
go
every
day
to
meet
*NL*
a
woman
at
some
party
or
entertainment
by
the
charm
of
which
we
imagine
*NL*
it
is
that
we
are
attracted
.
Then
I
observed
the
rare
,
almost
archaic
*NL*
phrases
which
he
liked
to
employ
at
certain
points
,
where
a
hidden
flow
*NL*
of
harmony
,
a
prelude
contained
and
concealed
in
the
work
itself
would
*NL*
animate
and
elevate
his
style
;
and
it
was
at
such
points
as
these
,
*NL*
too
,
that
he
would
begin
to
speak
of
the
``
vain
dream
of
life
,
''
of
the
*NL*
``
inexhaustible
torrent
of
fair
forms
,
''
of
the
``
sterile
,
splendid
torture
*NL*
of
understanding
and
loving
,
''
of
the
``
moving
effigies
which
ennoble
for
*NL*
all
time
the
charming
and
venerable
fronts
of
our
cathedrals
''
;
that
he
*NL*
would
express
a
whole
system
of
philosophy
,
new
to
me
,
by
the
use
of
*NL*
marvellous
imagery
,
to
the
inspiration
of
which
I
would
naturally
have
*NL*
ascribed
that
sound
of
harping
which
began
to
chime
and
echo
in
my
ears
,
*NL*
an
accompaniment
to
which
that
imagery
added
something
ethereal
and
*NL*
sublime
.
One
of
these
passages
of
Bergotte
,
the
third
or
fourth
which
I
*NL*
had
detached
from
the
rest
,
filled
me
with
a
joy
to
which
the
meagre
joy
*NL*
I
had
tasted
in
the
first
passage
bore
no
comparison
,
a
joy
which
I
felt
*NL*
myself
to
have
experienced
in
some
innermost
chamber
of
my
soul
,
deep
,
*NL*
undivided
,
vast
,
from
which
all
obstructions
and
partitions
seemed
to
*NL*
have
been
swept
away
.
For
what
had
happened
was
that
,
while
I
recognised
*NL*
in
this
passage
the
same
taste
for
uncommon
phrases
,
the
same
bursts
*NL*
of
music
,
the
same
idealist
philosophy
which
had
been
present
in
the
*NL*
earlier
passages
without
my
having
taken
them
into
account
as
the
source
*NL*
of
my
pleasure
,
I
now
no
longer
had
the
impression
of
being
confronted
*NL*
by
a
particular
passage
in
one
of
Bergotte
's
works
,
which
traced
a
*NL*
purely
bi-dimensional
figure
in
outline
upon
the
surface
of
my
mind
,
but
*NL*
rather
of
the
`
ideal
passage
'
of
Bergotte
,
common
to
every
one
of
his
*NL*
books
,
and
to
which
all
the
earlier
,
similar
passages
,
now
becoming
*NL*
merged
in
it
,
had
added
a
kind
of
density
and
volume
,
by
which
my
own
*NL*
understanding
seemed
to
be
enlarged
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
by
no
means
Bergotte
's
sole
admirer
;
he
was
the
favourite
writer
*NL*
also
of
a
friend
of
my
mother
's
,
a
highly
literary
lady
;
while
Dr.
du
*NL*
Boulbon
had
kept
all
his
patients
waiting
until
he
finished
Bergotte
's
*NL*
latest
volume
;
and
it
was
from
his
consulting
room
,
and
from
a
house
in
*NL*
a
park
near
Combray
that
some
of
the
first
seeds
were
scattered
of
that
*NL*
taste
for
Bergotte
,
a
rare-growth
in
those
days
,
but
now
so
universally
*NL*
acclimatised
that
one
finds
it
flowering
everywhere
throughout
Europe
*NL*
and
America
,
and
even
in
the
tiniest
villages
,
rare
still
in
its
*NL*
refinement
,
but
in
that
alone
.
What
my
mother
's
friend
,
and
,
it
would
*NL*
seem
,
what
Dr.
du
Boulbon
liked
above
all
in
the
writings
of
Bergotte
*NL*
was
just
what
I
liked
,
the
same
flow
of
melody
,
the
same
old-fashioned
*NL*
phrases
,
and
certain
others
,
quite
simple
and
familiar
,
but
so
placed
by
*NL*
him
,
in
such
prominence
,
as
to
hint
at
a
particular
quality
of
taste
on
*NL*
his
part
;
and
also
,
in
the
sad
parts
of
his
books
,
a
sort
of
roughness
,
*NL*
a
tone
that
was
almost
harsh
.
And
he
himself
,
no
doubt
,
realised
that
*NL*
these
were
his
principal
attractions
.
For
in
his
later
books
,
if
he
had
*NL*
hit
upon
some
great
truth
,
or
upon
the
name
of
an
historic
cathedral
,
*NL*
he
would
break
off
his
narrative
,
and
in
an
invocation
,
an
apostrophe
,
a
*NL*
lengthy
prayer
,
would
give
a
free
outlet
to
that
effluence
which
,
in
*NL*
the
earlier
volumes
,
remained
buried
beneath
the
form
of
his
prose
,
*NL*
discernible
only
in
a
rippling
of
its
surface
,
and
perhaps
even
more
*NL*
delightful
,
more
harmonious
when
it
was
thus
veiled
from
the
eye
,
when
*NL*
the
reader
could
give
no
precise
indication
of
where
the
murmur
of
the
*NL*
current
began
,
or
of
where
it
died
away
.
These
passages
in
which
he
*NL*
delighted
were
our
favourites
also
.
For
my
own
part
I
knew
all
of
them
*NL*
by
heart
.
I
felt
even
disappointed
when
he
resumed
the
thread
of
his
*NL*
narrative
.
Whenever
he
spoke
of
something
whose
beauty
had
until
*NL*
then
remained
hidden
from
me
,
of
pine-forests
or
of
hailstorms
,
of
*NL*
_
Notre-Dame
de
Paris
_
,
of
_
Athalie
_
,
or
of
_
Ph√®dre
_
,
by
some
piece
*NL*
of
imagery
he
would
make
their
beauty
explode
and
drench
me
with
its
*NL*
essence
.
And
so
,
dimly
realising
that
the
universe
contained
innumerable
*NL*
elements
which
my
feeble
senses
would
be
powerless
to
discern
,
did
he
*NL*
not
bring
them
within
my
reach
,
I
wished
that
I
might
have
his
opinion
,
*NL*
some
metaphor
of
his
,
upon
everything
in
the
world
,
and
especially
upon
*NL*
such
things
as
I
might
have
an
opportunity
,
some
day
,
of
seeing
for
*NL*
myself
;
and
among
such
things
,
more
particularly
still
upon
some
of
the
*NL*
historic
buildings
of
France
,
upon
certain
views
of
the
sea
,
because
the
*NL*
emphasis
with
which
,
in
his
books
,
he
referred
to
these
shewed
that
he
*NL*
regarded
them
as
rich
in
significance
and
beauty
.
But
,
alas
,
upon
almost
*NL*
everything
in
the
world
his
opinion
was
unknown
to
me
.
I
had
no
doubt
*NL*
that
it
would
differ
entirely
from
my
own
,
since
his
came
down
from
an
*NL*
unknown
sphere
towards
which
I
was
striving
to
raise
myself
;
convinced
*NL*
that
my
thoughts
would
have
seemed
pure
foolishness
to
that
perfected
*NL*
spirit
,
I
had
so
completely
obliterated
them
all
that
,
if
I
happened
to
*NL*
find
in
one
of
his
books
something
which
had
already
occurred
to
my
own
*NL*
mind
,
my
heart
would
swell
with
gratitude
and
pride
as
though
some
deity
*NL*
had
,
in
his
infinite
bounty
,
restored
it
to
me
,
had
pronounced
it
to
be
*NL*
beautiful
and
right
.
It
happened
now
and
then
that
a
page
of
Bergotte
*NL*
would
express
precisely
those
ideas
which
I
used
often
at
night
,
when
*NL*
I
was
unable
to
sleep
,
to
write
to
my
grandmother
and
mother
,
and
so
*NL*
concisely
and
well
that
his
page
had
the
appearance
of
a
collection
of
*NL*
mottoes
for
me
to
set
at
the
head
of
my
letters
.
And
so
too
,
in
later
*NL*
years
,
when
I
began
to
compose
a
book
of
my
own
,
and
the
quality
of
some
*NL*
of
my
sentences
seemed
so
inadequate
that
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
*NL*
go
on
with
the
undertaking
,
I
would
find
the
equivalent
of
my
sentences
*NL*
in
Bergotte
's
.
But
it
was
only
then
,
when
I
read
them
in
his
pages
,
*NL*
that
I
could
enjoy
them
;
when
it
was
I
myself
who
composed
them
,
in
*NL*
my
anxiety
that
they
should
exactly
reproduce
what
I
seemed
to
have
*NL*
detected
in
my
mind
,
and
in
my
fear
of
their
not
turning
out
`
true
to
*NL*
life
,
'
I
had
no
time
to
ask
myself
whether
what
I
was
writing
would
be
*NL*
pleasant
to
read
!
But
indeed
there
was
no
kind
of
language
,
no
kind
of
*NL*
ideas
which
I
really
liked
,
except
these
.
My
feverish
and
unsatisfactory
*NL*
attempts
were
themselves
a
token
of
my
love
,
a
love
which
brought
me
no
*NL*
pleasure
,
but
was
,
for
all
that
,
intense
and
deep
.
And
so
,
when
I
came
*NL*
suddenly
upon
similar
phrases
in
the
writings
of
another
,
that
is
to
say
*NL*
stripped
of
their
familiar
accompaniment
of
scruples
and
repressions
and
*NL*
self-tormentings
,
I
was
free
to
indulge
to
the
full
my
own
appetite
*NL*
for
such
things
,
just
as
a
cook
who
,
once
in
a
while
,
has
no
dinner
to
*NL*
prepare
for
other
people
,
can
then
find
time
to
gormandise
himself
.
And
*NL*
so
,
when
I
had
found
,
one
day
,
in
a
book
by
Bergotte
,
some
joke
about
*NL*
an
old
family
servant
,
to
which
his
solemn
and
magnificent
style
added
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
irony
,
but
which
was
in
principle
what
I
had
often
said
to
*NL*
my
grandmother
about
Fran√ßoise
,
and
when
,
another
time
,
I
had
discovered
*NL*
that
he
thought
not
unworthy
of
reflection
in
one
of
those
mirrors
of
*NL*
absolute
Truth
which
were
his
writings
,
a
remark
similar
to
one
which
I
*NL*
had
had
occasion
to
make
on
our
friend
M.
Legrandin
-LRB-
and
,
moreover
,
my
*NL*
remarks
on
Fran√ßoise
and
M.
Legrandin
were
among
those
which
I
would
*NL*
most
resolutely
have
sacrificed
for
Bergotte
's
sake
,
in
the
belief
*NL*
that
he
would
find
them
quite
without
interest
-RRB-
;
then
it
was
suddenly
*NL*
revealed
to
me
that
my
own
humble
existence
and
the
Realms
of
Truth
were
*NL*
less
widely
separated
than
I
had
supposed
,
that
at
certain
points
they
*NL*
were
actually
in
contact
;
and
in
my
new-found
confidence
and
joy
I
wept
*NL*
upon
his
printed
page
,
as
in
the
arms
of
a
long-lost
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
his
books
I
had
formed
an
impression
of
Bergotte
as
a
frail
and
*NL*
disappointed
old
man
,
who
had
lost
his
children
,
and
had
never
found
*NL*
any
consolation
.
And
so
I
would
read
,
or
rather
sing
his
sentences
in
*NL*
my
brain
,
with
rather
more
_
dolce
_
,
rather
more
_
lento
_
than
he
himself
*NL*
had
,
perhaps
,
intended
,
and
his
simplest
phrase
would
strike
my
ears
*NL*
with
something
peculiarly
gentle
and
loving
in
its
intonation
.
More
than
*NL*
anything
else
in
the
world
I
cherished
his
philosophy
,
and
had
pledged
*NL*
myself
to
it
in
lifelong
devotion
.
It
made
me
impatient
to
reach
the
*NL*
age
when
I
should
be
eligible
to
attend
the
class
at
school
called
*NL*
`
Philosophy
.
'
I
did
not
wish
to
learn
or
do
anything
else
there
,
but
*NL*
simply
to
exist
and
be
guided
entirely
by
the
mind
of
Bergotte
,
and
,
*NL*
if
I
had
been
told
then
that
the
metaphysicians
whom
I
was
actually
to
*NL*
follow
there
resembled
him
in
nothing
,
I
should
have
been
struck
down
by
*NL*
the
despair
a
young
lover
feels
who
has
sworn
lifelong
fidelity
,
when
*NL*
a
friend
speaks
to
him
of
the
other
mistresses
he
will
have
in
time
to
*NL*
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Sunday
,
while
I
was
reading
in
the
garden
,
I
was
interrupted
by
*NL*
Swann
,
who
had
come
to
call
upon
my
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
reading
?
May
I
look
?
Why
,
it
's
Bergotte
!
Who
has
been
*NL*
telling
you
about
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
Bloch
was
responsible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
that
boy
I
saw
here
once
,
who
looks
so
like
the
Bellini
*NL*
portrait
of
Mahomet
II
.
It
's
an
astonishing
likeness
;
he
has
the
same
*NL*
arched
eyebrows
and
hooked
nose
and
prominent
cheekbones
.
When
his
beard
*NL*
comes
he
'll
be
Mahomet
himself
.
Anyhow
he
has
good
taste
,
for
Bergotte
*NL*
is
a
charming
creature
.
''
And
seeing
how
much
I
seemed
to
admire
*NL*
Bergotte
,
Swann
,
who
never
spoke
at
all
about
the
people
he
knew
,
made
*NL*
an
exception
in
my
favour
and
said
:
``
I
know
him
well
;
if
you
would
like
*NL*
him
to
write
a
few
words
on
the
title-page
of
your
book
I
could
ask
him
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
dared
not
accept
such
an
offer
,
but
bombarded
Swann
with
questions
*NL*
about
his
friend
.
``
Can
you
tell
me
,
please
,
who
is
his
favourite
actor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Actor
?
No
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
But
I
do
know
this
:
there
's
not
a
man
on
the
*NL*
stage
whom
he
thinks
equal
to
Berma
;
he
puts
her
above
everyone
.
Have
*NL*
you
seen
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
my
parents
do
not
allow
me
to
go
to
the
theatre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
pity
.
You
should
insist
.
Berma
in
_
Ph√®dre
_
,
in
the
_
Cid
_
;
*NL*
well
,
she
's
only
an
actress
,
if
you
like
,
but
you
know
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
very
much
in
the
`
hierarchy
'
of
the
arts
.
''
As
he
spoke
I
*NL*
noticed
,
what
had
often
struck
me
before
in
his
conversations
with
*NL*
my
grandmother
's
sisters
,
that
whenever
he
spoke
of
serious
matters
,
*NL*
whenever
he
used
an
expression
which
seemed
to
imply
a
definite
opinion
*NL*
upon
some
important
subject
,
he
would
take
care
to
isolate
,
to
sterilise
*NL*
it
by
using
a
special
intonation
,
mechanical
and
ironic
,
as
though
he
*NL*
had
put
the
phrase
or
word
between
inverted
commas
,
and
was
anxious
*NL*
to
disclaim
any
personal
responsibility
for
it
;
as
who
should
say
``
the
*NL*
`
hierarchy
,
'
do
n't
you
know
,
as
silly
people
call
it
.
''
But
then
,
if
it
*NL*
was
so
absurd
,
why
did
he
say
the
`
hierarchy
'
?
A
moment
later
he
went
*NL*
on
:
``
Her
acting
will
give
you
as
noble
an
inspiration
as
any
masterpiece
*NL*
of
art
in
the
world
,
as
--
oh
,
I
do
n't
know
--
''
and
he
began
to
laugh
,
*NL*
``
shall
we
say
the
Queens
of
Chartres
?
''
Until
then
I
had
supposed
that
*NL*
his
horror
of
having
to
give
a
serious
opinion
was
something
Parisian
*NL*
and
refined
,
in
contrast
to
the
provincial
dogmatism
of
my
grandmother
's
*NL*
sisters
;
and
I
had
imagined
also
that
it
was
characteristic
of
the
*NL*
mental
attitude
towards
life
of
the
circle
in
which
Swann
moved
,
*NL*
where
,
by
a
natural
reaction
from
the
`
lyrical
'
enthusiasms
of
earlier
*NL*
generations
,
an
excessive
importance
was
given
to
small
and
precise
*NL*
facts
,
formerly
regarded
as
vulgar
,
and
anything
in
the
nature
of
*NL*
`
phrase-making
'
was
banned
.
But
now
I
found
myself
slightly
shocked
*NL*
by
this
attitude
which
Swann
invariably
adopted
when
face
to
face
with
*NL*
generalities
.
He
appeared
unwilling
to
risk
even
having
an
opinion
,
and
*NL*
to
be
at
his
ease
only
when
he
could
furnish
,
with
meticulous
accuracy
,
*NL*
some
precise
but
unimportant
detail
.
But
in
so
doing
he
did
not
take
*NL*
into
account
that
even
here
he
was
giving
an
opinion
,
holding
a
brief
*NL*
-LRB-
as
they
say
-RRB-
for
something
,
that
the
accuracy
of
his
details
had
an
*NL*
importance
of
its
own
.
I
thought
again
of
the
dinner
that
night
,
when
I
*NL*
had
been
so
unhappy
because
Mamma
would
not
be
coming
up
to
my
room
,
and
*NL*
when
he
had
dismissed
the
balls
given
by
the
Princesse
de
L√©on
as
being
*NL*
of
no
importance
.
And
yet
it
was
to
just
that
sort
of
amusement
that
he
*NL*
was
devoting
his
life
.
For
what
other
kind
of
existence
did
he
reserve
*NL*
the
duties
of
saying
in
all
seriousness
what
he
thought
about
things
,
*NL*
of
formulating
judgments
which
he
would
not
put
between
inverted
commas
;
*NL*
and
when
would
he
cease
to
give
himself
up
to
occupations
of
which
at
*NL*
the
same
,
time
he
made
out
that
they
were
absurd
?
I
noticed
,
too
,
in
the
*NL*
manner
in
which
Swann
spoke
to
me
of
Bergotte
,
something
which
,
to
do
*NL*
him
justice
,
was
not
peculiar
to
himself
,
but
was
shared
by
all
that
*NL*
writer
's
admirers
at
that
time
,
at
least
by
my
mother
's
friend
and
*NL*
by
Dr.
du
Boulbon
.
Like
Swann
,
they
would
say
of
Bergotte
:
``
He
has
a
*NL*
charming
mind
,
so
individual
,
he
has
a
way
of
his
own
of
saying
things
,
*NL*
which
is
a
little
far-fetched
,
but
so
pleasant
.
You
never
need
to
look
*NL*
for
his
name
on
the
title-page
,
you
can
tell
his
work
at
once
.
''
But
*NL*
none
of
them
had
yet
gone
so
far
as
to
say
``
He
is
a
great
writer
,
he
has
*NL*
great
talent
.
''
They
did
not
even
credit
him
with
talent
at
all
.
They
*NL*
did
not
speak
,
because
they
were
not
aware
of
it
.
We
are
very
slow
in
*NL*
recognising
in
the
peculiar
physiognomy
of
a
new
writer
the
type
which
*NL*
is
labelled
`
great
talent
'
in
our
museum
of
general
ideas
.
Simply
*NL*
because
that
physiognomy
is
new
and
strange
,
we
can
find
in
it
no
*NL*
resemblance
to
what
we
are
accustomed
to
call
talent
.
We
say
rather
*NL*
originality
,
charm
,
delicacy
,
strength
;
and
then
one
day
we
add
up
the
*NL*
sum
of
these
,
and
find
that
it
amounts
simply
to
talent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
any
books
in
which
Bergotte
has
written
about
Berma
?
''
I
asked
*NL*
M.
Swann
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
has
,
in
that
little
essay
on
Racine
,
but
it
must
be
out
of
*NL*
print
.
Still
,
there
has
perhaps
been
a
second
impression
.
I
will
find
*NL*
out
.
Anyhow
,
I
can
ask
Bergotte
himself
all
that
you
want
to
know
next
*NL*
time
he
comes
to
dine
with
us
.
He
never
misses
a
week
,
from
one
year
's
*NL*
end
to
another
.
He
is
my
daughter
's
greatest
friend
.
They
go
about
*NL*
together
,
and
look
at
old
towns
and
cathedrals
and
castles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
still
completely
ignorant
of
the
different
grades
in
the
social
*NL*
hierarchy
,
the
fact
that
my
father
found
it
impossible
for
us
to
see
*NL*
anything
of
Swann
's
wife
and
daughter
had
,
for
a
long
time
,
had
the
*NL*
contrary
effect
of
making
me
imagine
them
as
separated
from
us
by
an
*NL*
enormous
gulf
,
which
greatly
enhanced
their
dignity
and
importance
in
*NL*
my
eyes
.
I
was
sorry
that
my
mother
did
not
dye
her
hair
and
redden
her
*NL*
lips
,
as
I
had
heard
our
neighbour
,
Mme.
Sazerat
,
say
that
Mme.
Swann
*NL*
did
,
to
gratify
not
her
husband
but
M.
de
Charlus
;
and
I
felt
that
,
to
*NL*
her
,
we
must
be
an
object
of
scorn
,
which
distressed
me
particularly
on
*NL*
account
of
the
daughter
,
such
a
pretty
little
girl
,
as
I
had
heard
,
and
*NL*
one
of
whom
I
used
often
to
dream
,
always
imagining
her
with
the
same
*NL*
features
and
appearance
,
which
I
bestowed
upon
her
quite
arbitrarily
,
*NL*
but
with
a
charming
effect
.
But
from
this
afternoon
,
when
I
had
learned
*NL*
that
Mlle.
Swann
was
a
creature
living
in
such
rare
and
fortunate
*NL*
circumstances
,
bathed
,
as
in
her
natural
element
,
in
such
a
sea
of
*NL*
privilege
that
,
if
she
should
ask
her
parents
whether
anyone
were
coming
*NL*
to
dinner
,
she
would
be
answered
in
those
two
syllables
,
radiant
with
*NL*
celestial
light
,
would
hear
the
name
of
that
golden
guest
who
was
to
*NL*
her
no
more
than
an
old
friend
of
her
family
,
Bergotte
;
that
for
her
the
*NL*
intimate
conversation
at
table
,
corresponding
to
what
my
great-aunt
's
*NL*
conversation
was
for
me
,
would
be
the
words
of
Bergotte
upon
all
those
*NL*
subjects
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
take
up
in
his
writings
,
and
on
*NL*
which
I
would
fain
have
heard
him
utter
oracles
;
and
that
,
above
all
,
*NL*
when
she
went
to
visit
other
towns
,
he
would
be
walking
by
her
side
,
*NL*
unrecognised
and
glorious
,
like
the
gods
who
came
down
,
of
old
,
from
*NL*
heaven
to
dwell
among
mortal
men
:
then
I
realised
both
the
rare
worth
*NL*
of
a
creature
such
as
Mlle.
Swann
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
how
coarse
and
*NL*
ignorant
I
should
appear
to
her
;
and
I
felt
so
keenly
how
pleasant
and
*NL*
yet
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
me
to
become
her
friend
that
I
was
*NL*
filled
at
once
with
longing
and
with
despair
.
And
usually
,
from
this
*NL*
time
forth
,
when
I
thought
of
her
,
I
would
see
her
standing
before
the
*NL*
porch
of
a
cathedral
,
explaining
to
me
what
each
of
the
statues
meant
,
*NL*
and
,
with
a
smile
which
was
my
highest
commendation
,
presenting
me
,
as
*NL*
her
friend
,
to
Bergotte
.
And
invariably
the
charm
of
all
the
fancies
*NL*
which
the
thought
of
cathedrals
used
to
inspire
in
me
,
the
charm
of
the
*NL*
hills
and
valleys
of
the
He
de
France
and
of
the
plains
of
Normandy
,
*NL*
would
radiate
brightness
and
beauty
over
the
picture
I
had
formed
in
my
*NL*
mind
of
Mlle.
Swann
;
nothing
more
remained
but
to
know
and
to
love
*NL*
her
.
Once
we
believe
that
a
fellow-creature
has
a
share
in
some
unknown
*NL*
existence
to
which
that
creature
's
love
for
ourselves
can
win
us
*NL*
admission
,
that
is
,
of
all
the
preliminary
conditions
which
Love
exacts
,
*NL*
the
one
to
which
he
attaches
most
importance
,
the
one
which
makes
him
*NL*
generous
or
indifferent
as
to
the
rest
.
Even
those
women
who
pretend
*NL*
that
they
judge
a
man
by
his
exterior
only
,
see
in
that
exterior
an
*NL*
emanation
from
some
special
way
of
life
.
And
that
is
why
they
fall
*NL*
in
love
with
a
soldier
or
a
fireman
,
whose
uniform
makes
them
less
*NL*
particular
about
his
face
;
they
kiss
and
believe
that
beneath
the
*NL*
crushing
breastplate
there
beats
a
heart
different
from
the
rest
,
more
*NL*
gallant
,
more
adventurous
,
more
tender
;
and
so
it
is
that
a
young
king
*NL*
or
a
crown
prince
may
travel
in
foreign
countries
and
make
the
most
*NL*
gratifying
conquests
,
and
yet
lack
entirely
that
regular
and
classic
*NL*
profile
which
would
be
indispensable
,
I
dare
say
,
in
an
outside-broker
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
reading
in
the
garden
,
a
thing
my
great-aunt
would
never
*NL*
have
understood
my
doing
save
on
a
Sunday
,
that
being
the
day
on
which
*NL*
it
was
unlawful
to
indulge
in
any
serious
occupation
,
and
on
which
she
*NL*
herself
would
lay
aside
her
sewing
-LRB-
on
a
week-day
she
would
have
said
,
*NL*
``
How
you
can
go
on
amusing
yourself
with
a
book
;
it
is
n't
Sunday

''
putting
into
the
word
`
amusing
'
an
implication
of
childishness
*NL*
and
waste
of
time
-RRB-
,
my
aunt
L√©onie
would
be
gossiping
with
Fran√ßoise
*NL*
until
it
was
time
for
Eulalie
to
arrive
.
She
would
tell
her
that
she
had
*NL*
just
seen
Mme.
Goupil
go
by
``
without
an
umbrella
,
in
the
silk
dress
*NL*
she
had
made
for
her
the
other
day
at
Ch√¢teaudun
.
If
she
has
far
to
go
*NL*
before
vespers
,
she
may
get
it
properly
soaked

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
''
-LRB-
which
meant
also
``
very
likely
not
''
-RRB-
was
the
answer
,
*NL*
for
Fran√ßoise
did
not
wish
definitely
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
a
*NL*
happier
alternative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
now
,
''
went
on
my
aunt
,
beating
her
brow
,
``
that
reminds
me
that
*NL*
I
never
heard
if
she
got
to
church
this
morning
before
the
Elevation

I
*NL*
must
remember
to
ask
Eulalie
...
Fran√ßoise
,
just
look
at
that
black
cloud
*NL*
behind
the
steeple
,
and
how
poor
the
light
is
on

slates

you
may
be
*NL*
certain
it
will
rain
before

day
is
out

It
could
n't
possibly
keep
on
*NL*
like
this

it
's
been
too
hot

And
the
sooner
the
better

for
until

storm

water

she
concluded
,
since
,
in
*NL*
her
mind
,
the
desire
to
accelerate
the
digestion
of
her
Vichy
water
was
*NL*
of
infinitely
greater
importance
than
her
fear
of
seeing
Mme.
Goupil
's
*NL*
new
dress
ruined

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely

``
And
you
know

much

Suddenly
my

turned
pale

o'clock

she
*NL*
exclaimed
.
``

falling
precipitately

the
uncertainty

Fran√ßoise
,
*NL*
not
unkindly
,
refraining
until
she
should
be
alone
with
the

stating
her
belief

Only

*NL*
A
bright
flush
animated
my

's
cheeks
;
it
was
Eulalie

As
ill
luck
*NL*
would
have
it
,
scarcely
had
she
been
admitted
to
the
presence
when
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
reappeared
and
,
with
a
smile
which
was
meant
to
indicate
her
*NL*
full
participation
in
the
pleasure
which
,
she
had
no
doubt
,
her
tidings
*NL*
would
give
my
aunt
,
articulating
each
syllable
so
as
to
shew
that
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
having
to
translate
them
into
indirect
speech
,
she
was
*NL*
repeating
,
as
a
good
servant
should
,
the
very
words
which
the
new
*NL*
visitor
had
condescended
to
use

said
:

could
see
him

His
reverence
does
not

to
disturb
Mme.

His
*NL*
reverence
is
downstairs

I
told
him
to
go
into
the
parlour

''
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
truth
been
known
,
the
Cur√©
's
visits
gave
my
aunt
no
such
*NL*
ecstatic
pleasure
as
Fran√ßoise
supposed
,
and
the
air
of
jubilation
with
*NL*
which
she
felt
bound
to
illuminate
her
face
whenever
she
had
to
announce
*NL*
his
arrival
,
did
not
altogether
correspond
to
what
was
felt
by
her
*NL*
invalid
.
The
Cur√©
-LRB-
an
excellent
man
,
with
whom
I
am
sorry
now
that
I
did
*NL*
not
converse
more
often
,
for
,
even
if
he
cared
nothing
for
the
arts
,
*NL*
he
knew
a
great
many
etymologies
-RRB-
,
being
in
the
habit
of
shewing
*NL*
distinguished
visitors
over
his
church
-LRB-
he
had
even
planned
to
compile
*NL*
a
history
of
the
Parish
of
Combray
-RRB-
,
used
to
weary
her
with
his
endless
*NL*
explanations
,
which
,
incidentally
,
never
varied
in
the
least
degree
.
*NL*
But
when
his
visit
synchronized
exactly
with
Eulalie
's
it
became
frankly
*NL*
distasteful
to
my
aunt
.
She
would
have
preferred
to
make
the
most
of
*NL*
Eulalie
,
and
not
to
have
had
the
whole
of
her
circle
about
her
at
one
*NL*
time
.
But
she
dared
not
send
the
Cur√©
away
,
and
had
to
content
herself
*NL*
with
making
a
sign
to
Eulalie
not
to
leave
when
he
did
,
so
that
she
*NL*
might
have
her
to
herself
for
a
little
after
he
had
gone

What

there

certain

in

are
well
worth

there
are
others

The

our

dirty

out

still

it
is
of
a

majestic
character

take

for

the
Esther

though
*NL*
personally
I
would
not
give
a
brass
farthing
for
the
pair
of
them

*NL*
experts
put
them
next
after
the
ones
at
Sens.
I
can
quite
see

too

that
*NL*
apart
from
certain
details

are

well

a

realistic

it

I
ask
you

to
leave

up

shut
out
all
the
daylight

even
confuse
the

they
refuse

of
his

she
was

married
her

-LRB-
My
grandmother

whose
steady
refusal
to

any
interest

had
ended
in

her
confusing
all

Duchesse

used
to
make
out
that
she

The

then
burst
out

she

would
attempt

justify
herself
by
harking
back
to
some
invitation

a
christening

funeral
:
``
I
feel
sure
that
there
was
a
Guermantes

And
for
once
I
would
side
with

against

Very

the

superb
windows

almost
all
quite
modern

including
that
*NL*
most
imposing
`

good

I
said

you
find
so
extraordinary
in

Why

it
was

just
his

that
it
represented
Gilbert
the
Bad

a
Lord

a
direct
descendant

Why

have
you
never

Very
well

these

by
no

the
most
curious
that
have

occurred

my
good

the

become
in

Saint

nothing
more

Gilbert

brother

Charles
the

was

pious
prince

,
*NL*
having
early
in
life
lost
his
father
,
Pepin
the
Mad
,
who
died
as
a
*NL*
result
of
his
mental
infirmity

he
wielded
the
supreme
power
with
all
*NL*
the
arrogance
of
a
man
who
has
not
been
subjected
to
discipline
in
his
*NL*
youth
,
so
much
so
that
,
whenever
he
saw
a
man
in
a
town
whose
face
*NL*
he
did
not
remember
,
he
would
massacre
the
whole
place
,
to
the
last
*NL*
inhabitant

Gilbert
,
wishing
to
be
avenged
on
Charles
,
caused
the
church
*NL*
at
Combray
to
be
burned
down
,
the
original
church

that
was

which
*NL*
Th√©odebert

when

court

Nothing
remains

the
crypt

into
which
Th√©odore
has
probably
taken
you

burned
all

Finally

he
defeated
the
unlucky
Charles

the
*NL*

of
William

which
the
Cur√©
pronounced
``
Will

the
Conqueror

is
why
so
many

still
come

But
he

not

have
managed

win
the

Combray

they
fell
upon
him
as
he
was
coming
out
from
mass

cut
*NL*
off
his
head

Th√©odore

what

have
to
go
on

hands

do

wish
to
crack
your
skull
,
and
you
collect
all
the
cobwebs
off

the
staircase
upon
your
clothes

In
any
case
you
should
be
well
wrapped

noticing
my

be
capable

climbing

his
belfry

there
's
a
strong
breeze
there

once
you
get
to

Some
people

even
assure
me
that
they
have
felt
the
chill
of
death
up
there

No
*NL*
matter

on
Sundays
there
are
always
clubs

societies

who
come
,
*NL*
some
of
them
,
long
distances
to
admire
our
beautiful
panorama

and
they
*NL*
always
go
home
charmed

Wait
now

next

if
the
weather
holds
,
you
*NL*
will
be
sure

find
a

You
must

admit

certainly

that
the
view
from
up

is
like
a
fairy-tale

with
*NL*
what
you
might
call
vistas
along
the
plain

have
quite

special

charm
of
their
own

On
a
clear

you
can
see
as
far

Verneuil

*NL*
then
another
thing
;
you
can
see
at
the
same
time
places
which
you
are
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
seeing
one
without
the
other
,
as
,
for
instance
,
the
course
*NL*
of
the
Vivonne
and
the
ditches
at
Saint-Assise-l√®s-Combray
,
which
*NL*
are
separated
,
really
,
by
a
screen
of
tall
trees
;
or
,
to
take
another
*NL*
example
,
there
are
all
the
canals
at
Jouy-le-Vicomte
,
which
is
*NL*
_
Gaudiacus
vicecomitis
_
,
as
of
course
you
know

Each
time
that
I
have
*NL*
been
to
Jouy
I
have
seen
a
bit
of
a
canal
in
one
place
,
and
then
I
have
*NL*
turned
a
corner
and
seen
another
,
but
when
I
saw
the
second
I
could
no
*NL*
longer
see
the
first
.
I
tried
in

to
imagine
how
they
lay
by
one
*NL*
another
;
it
was
no
good

But
,
from
the
top
of
Saint-Hilaire

it
's
quite
*NL*
another
matter
;
the
whole
countryside
is
spread
out
before
you
like
a
*NL*
map
.
Only
,
you
can
not
make
out
the
water
;
you
would
say
that
there
were
*NL*
great
rifts
in
the
town
,
slicing
it
up
so
neatly
that
it
looks
like
a
*NL*
loaf
of
bread
which
still
holds
together
after
it
has
been
cut
up
.
To
*NL*
get
it
all
quite
perfect
you
would
have
to
be
in
both
places
at
once
;
up
*NL*
here
on
the
top
of
Saint-Hilaire
and
down
there
at
Jouy-le-Vicomte
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Cur√©
had
so
much
exhausted
my
aunt
that
no
sooner
had
he
gone
than
*NL*
she
was
obliged
to
send
away
Eulalie
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
my
poor
Eulalie
,
''
she
said
in
a
feeble
voice
,
drawing
a
coin
from
*NL*
a
small
purse
which
lay
ready
to
her
hand
.
``
This
is
just
something
so
*NL*
that
you
shall
not
forget
me
in
your
prayers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
,
Mme.
Octave
,
I
do
n't
think
I
ought
to
;
you
know
very
well
*NL*
that
I
do
n't
come
here
for
that
!
''
So
Eulalie
would
answer
,
with
the
*NL*
same
hesitation
and
the
same
embarrassment
,
every
Sunday
,
as
though
*NL*
each
temptation
were
the
first
,
and
with
a
look
of
displeasure
which
*NL*
enlivened
my
aunt
and
never
offended
her
,
for
if
it
so
happened
that
*NL*
Eulalie
,
when
she
took
the
money
,
looked
a
little
less
sulky
than
usual
,
*NL*
my
aunt
would
remark
afterwards
,
``
I
can
not
think
what
has
come
over
*NL*
Eulalie
;
I
gave
her
just
the
trifle
I
always
give
,
and
she
did
not
look
*NL*
at
all
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
she
has
very
much
to
complain
of
,
all
the
same
,
''
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
would
sigh
grimly
,
for
she
had
a
tendency
to
regard
as
petty
*NL*
cash
all
that
my
aunt
might
give
her
for
herself
or
her
children
,
and
as
*NL*
treasure
riotously
squandered
on
a
pampered
and
ungrateful
darling
the
*NL*
little
coins
slipped
,
Sunday
by
Sunday
,
into
Eulalie
's
hand
,
but
so
*NL*
discreetly
passed
that
Fran√ßoise
never
managed
to
see
them
.
It
was
*NL*
not
that
she
wanted
to
have
for
herself
the
money
my
aunt
bestowed
*NL*
on
Eulalie
.
She
already
enjoyed
a
sufficiency
of
all
that
my
*NL*
aunt
possessed
,
in
the
knowledge
that
the
wealth
of
the
mistress
*NL*
automatically
ennobled
and
glorified
the
maid
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
;
*NL*
and
that
she
herself
was
conspicuous
and
worthy
to
be
praised
throughout
*NL*
Combray
,
Jouy-le-Vicomte
,
and
other
cities
of
men
,
on
account
of
my
*NL*
aunt
's
many
farms
,
her
frequent
and
prolonged
visits
from
the
Cur√©
,
and
*NL*
the
astonishing
number
of
bottles
of
Vichy
water
which
she
consumed
.
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
was
avaricious
only
for
my
aunt
;
had
she
had
control
over
*NL*
my
aunt
's
fortune
-LRB-
which
would
have
more
than
satisfied
her
highest
*NL*
ambition
-RRB-
she
would
have
guarded
it
from
the
assaults
of
strangers
with
*NL*
a
maternal
ferocity
.
She
would
,
however
,
have
seen
no
great
harm
in
what
*NL*
my
aunt
,
whom
she
knew
to
be
incurably
generous
,
allowed
herself
to
give
*NL*
away
,
had
she
given
only
to
those
who
were
already
rich
.
Perhaps
*NL*
she
felt
that
such
persons
,
not
being
actually
in
need
of
my
aunt
's
*NL*
presents
,
could
not
be
suspected
of
simulating
affection
for
her
on
*NL*
that
account
.
Besides
,
presents
offered
to
persons
of
great
wealth
and
*NL*
position
,
such
as
Mme.
Sazerat
,
M.
Swann
,
M.
Legrandin
and
Mme.
Goupil
,
*NL*
to
persons
of
the
`
same
class
'
as
my
aunt
,
and
who
would
naturally
*NL*
`
mix
with
her
,
'
seemed
to
Fran√ßoise
to
be
included
among
the
ornamental
*NL*
customs
of
that
strange
and
brilliant
life
led
by
rich
people
,
who
*NL*
hunted
and
shot
,
gave
balls
and
paid
visits
,
a
life
which
she
would
*NL*
contemplate
with
an
admiring
smile
.
But
it
was
by
no
means
the
same
*NL*
thing
if
,
for
this
princely
exchange
of
courtesies
,
my
aunt
substituted
*NL*
mere
charity
,
if
her
beneficiaries
were
of
the
class
which
Fran√ßoise
*NL*
would
label
``
people
like
myself
,
''
or
``
people
no
better
than
myself
,
''
*NL*
people
whom
she
despised
even
more
if
they
did
not
address
her
always
*NL*
as
``
Mme.
Fran√ßoise
,
''
just
to
shew
that
they
considered
themselves
to
be
*NL*
`
not
as
good
.
'
And
when
she
saw
that
,
despite
all
her
warnings
,
my
aunt
*NL*
continued
to
do
exactly
as
she
pleased
,
and
to
fling
money
away
with
*NL*
both
hands
-LRB-
or
so
,
at
least
,
Fran√ßoise
believed
-RRB-
on
undeserving
objects
,
*NL*
she
began
to
find
that
the
presents
she
herself
received
from
my
aunt
*NL*
were
very
tiny
compared
to
the
imaginary
riches
squandered
upon
*NL*
Eulalie
,
There
was
not
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Combray
,
a
farm
of
such
*NL*
prosperity
and
importance
that
Fran√ßoise
doubted
Eulalie
's
ability
to
*NL*
buy
it
,
without
thinking
twice
,
out
of
the
capital
which
her
visits
to
*NL*
my
aunt
had
`
brought
in
.
'
It
must
be
added
that
Eulalie
had
formed
an
*NL*
exactly
similar
estimate
of
the
vast
and
secret
hoards
of
Fran√ßoise
.
*NL*
So
,
every
Sunday
,
after
Eulalie
had
gone
,
Fran√ßoise
would
mercilessly
*NL*
prophesy
her
coming
downfall
.
She
hated
Eulalie
,
but
was
at
the
same
*NL*
time
afraid
of
her
,
and
so
felt
bound
,
when
Eulalie
was
there
,
to
`
look
*NL*
pleasant
.
'
But
she
would
make
up
for
that
after
the
other
's
departure
;
*NL*
never
,
it
is
true
,
alluding
to
her
by
name
,
but
hinting
at
her
in
*NL*
Sibylline
oracles
,
or
in
utterances
of
a
comprehensive
character
,
like
*NL*
those
of
Ecclesiastes
,
the
Preacher
,
but
so
worded
that
their
special
*NL*
application
could
not
escape
my
aunt
.
After
peering
out
at
the
side
of
*NL*
the
curtain
to
see
whether
Eulalie
had
shut
the
front-door
behind
her
;
*NL*
``
Flatterers
know
how
to
make
themselves
welcome
,
and
to
gather
up
the
*NL*
crumbs
;
but
have
patience
,
have
patience
;
our
God
is
a
jealous
God
,
and
*NL*
one
fine
day
He
will
be
avenged
upon
them
!
''
she
would
declaim
,
with
the
*NL*
sidelong
,
insinuating
glance
of
Joash
,
thinking
of
Athaliah
alone
when
*NL*
he
says
that
the
*NL*
*NL*
...
prosperity
*NL*
Of
wicked
men
runs
like
a
torrent
past
,
*NL*
And
soon
is
spent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
this
memorable
afternoon
,
when
the
Cur√©
had
come
as
well
,
and
*NL*
by
his
interminable
visit
had
drained
my
aunt
's
strength
,
Fran√ßoise
*NL*
followed
Eulalie
from
the
room
,
saying
:
``
Mme.
Octave
,
I
will
leave
you
*NL*
to
rest
;
you
look
utterly
tired
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
my
aunt
answered
her
not
a
word
,
breathing
a
sigh
so
faint
that
*NL*
it
seemed
it
must
prove
her
last
,
and
lying
there
with
closed
eyes
,
as
*NL*
though
already
dead
.
But
hardly
had
Fran√ßoise
arrived
downstairs
,
when
*NL*
four
peals
of
a
bell
,
pulled
with
the
utmost
violence
,
reverberated
*NL*
through
the
house
,
and
my
aunt
,
sitting
erect
upon
her
bed
,
called
out
:
*NL*
``
Has
Eulalie
gone
yet
?
Would
you
believe
it
;
I
forgot
to
ask
her
whether
*NL*
Mme.
Goupil
arrived
in
church
before
the
Elevation
.
Run
after
her
,
*NL*
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fran√ßoise
returned
alone
,
having
failed
to
overtake
Eulalie
.
``
It
*NL*
is
most
provoking
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
The
one
important
*NL*
thing
that
I
had
to
ask
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
life
went
by
for
my
aunt
L√©onie
,
always
the
same
,
in
the
*NL*
gentle
uniformity
of
what
she
called
,
with
a
pretence
of
deprecation
*NL*
but
with
a
deep
tenderness
,
her
`
little
jog-trot
.
'
Respected
by
all
*NL*
and
sundry
,
not
merely
in
her
own
house
,
where
every
one
of
us
,
having
*NL*
learned
the
futility
of
recommending
any
healthier
mode
of
life
,
had
*NL*
become
gradually
resigned
to
its
observance
,
but
in
the
village
as
well
,
*NL*
where
,
three
streets
away
,
a
tradesman
who
had
to
hammer
nails
into
a
*NL*
packing-case
would
send
first
to
Fran√ßoise
to
make
sure
that
my
aunt
*NL*
was
not
`
resting
'
--
her
`
little
jog-trot
'
was
,
none
the
less
,
brutally
*NL*
disturbed
on
one
occasion
in
this
same
year
.
Like
a
fruit
hidden
among
*NL*
its
leaves
,
which
has
grown
and
ripened
unobserved
by
man
,
until
it
*NL*
falls
of
its
own
accord
,
there
came
upon
us
one
night
the
kitchen-maid
's
*NL*
confinement
.
Her
pains
were
unbearable
,
and
,
as
there
was
no
midwife
*NL*
in
Combray
,
Fran√ßoise
had
to
set
off
before
dawn
to
fetch
one
from
*NL*
Thiberzy
.
My
aunt
was
unable
to
`
rest
,
'
owing
to
the
cries
of
the
girl
,
*NL*
and
as
Fran√ßoise
,
though
the
distance
was
nothing
,
was
very
late
in
*NL*
returning
,
her
services
were
greatly
missed
.
And
so
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
the
morning
,
my
mother
said
to
me
:
``
Run
upstairs
,
and
see
if
your
aunt
*NL*
wants
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
into
the
first
of
her
two
rooms
,
and
through
the
open
door
of
the
*NL*
other
saw
my
aunt
lying
on
her
side
,
asleep
.
I
could
hear
her
breathing
,
*NL*
in
what
was
almost
distinguishable
as
a
snore
.
I
was
just
going
to
slip
*NL*
away
when
something
,
probably
the
sound
of
my
entry
,
interrupted
her
*NL*
sleep
,
and
made
it
`
change
speed
,
'
as
they
say
of
motorcars
nowadays
,
*NL*
for
the
music
of
her
snore
broke
off
for
a
second
and
began
again
on
a
*NL*
lower
note
;
then
she
awoke
,
and
half
turned
her
face
,
which
I
could
see
*NL*
for
the
first
time
;
a
kind
of
horror
was
imprinted
on
it
;
plainly
she
*NL*
had
just
escaped
from
some
terrifying
dream
.
She
could
not
see
me
from
*NL*
where
she
was
lying
,
and
I
stood
there
not
knowing
whether
I
ought
to
go
*NL*
forward
or
to
retire
;
but
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
return
to
a
sense
*NL*
of
reality
,
and
to
grasp
the
falsehood
of
the
visions
that
had
terrified
*NL*
her
;
a
smile
of
joy
,
a
pious
act
of
thanksgiving
to
God
,
Who
is
pleased
*NL*
to
grant
that
life
shall
be
less
cruel
than
our
dreams
,
feebly
illumined
*NL*
her
face
,
and
,
with
the
habit
she
had
formed
of
speaking
to
herself
,
*NL*
half-aloud
,
when
she
thought
herself
alone
,
she
murmured
:
``
The
Lord
be
*NL*
praised
!
We
have
nothing
to
disturb
us
here
but
the
kitchen-maid
's
baby
.
*NL*
And
I
've
been
dreaming
that
my
poor
Octave
had
come
back
to
life
,
and
*NL*
was
trying
to
make
me
take
a
walk
every
day
!
''
She
stretched
out
a
hand
*NL*
towards
her
rosary
,
which
was
lying
on
the
small
table
,
but
sleep
was
*NL*
once
again
getting
the
mastery
,
and
did
not
leave
her
the
strength
to
*NL*
reach
it
;
she
fell
asleep
,
calm
and
contented
,
and
I
crept
out
of
the
*NL*
room
on
tiptoe
,
without
either
her
or
anyone
's
else
ever
knowing
,
from
*NL*
that
day
to
this
,
what
I
had
seen
and
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
say
that
,
apart
from
such
rare
happenings
as
this
confinement
,
my
*NL*
aunt
's
`
little
jog-trot
'
never
underwent
any
variation
,
I
do
not
include
*NL*
those
variations
which
,
repeated
at
regular
intervals
and
in
identical
*NL*
form
,
did
no
more
,
really
,
than
print
a
sort
of
uniform
pattern
upon
*NL*
the
greater
uniformity
of
her
life
.
So
,
for
instance
,
every
Saturday
,
as
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
had
to
go
in
the
afternoon
to
market
at
Roussainville-le-Pin
,
*NL*
the
whole
household
would
have
to
have
luncheon
an
hour
earlier
.
And
my
*NL*
aunt
had
so
thoroughly
acquired
the
habit
of
this
weekly
exception
to
*NL*
her
general
habits
,
that
she
clung
to
it
as
much
as
to
the
rest
.
She
*NL*
was
so
well
`
routined
'
to
it
,
as
Fran√ßoise
would
say
,
that
if
,
on
a
*NL*
Saturday
,
she
had
had
to
wait
for
her
luncheon
until
the
regular
hour
,
*NL*
it
would
have
`
upset
'
her
as
much
as
if
she
had
had
,
on
an
ordinary
*NL*
day
,
to
put
her
luncheon
forward
to
its
Saturday
time
.
Incidentally
this
*NL*
acceleration
of
luncheon
gave
Saturday
,
for
all
of
us
,
an
individual
*NL*
character
,
kindly
and
rather
attractive
.
At
the
moment
when
,
ordinarily
,
*NL*
there
was
still
an
hour
to
be
lived
through
before
meal-time
sounded
,
*NL*
we
would
all
know
that
in
a
few
seconds
we
should
see
the
endives
*NL*
make
their
precocious
appearance
,
followed
by
the
special
favour
of
an
*NL*
omelette
,
an
unmerited
steak
.
The
return
of
this
asymmetrical
Saturday
*NL*
was
one
of
those
petty
occurrences
,
intra-mural
,
localised
,
almost
*NL*
civic
,
which
,
in
uneventful
lives
and
stable
orders
of
society
,
create
a
*NL*
kind
of
national
unity
,
and
become
the
favourite
theme
for
conversation
,
*NL*
for
pleasantries
,
for
anecdotes
which
can
be
embroidered
as
the
narrator
*NL*
pleases
;
it
would
have
provided
a
nucleus
,
ready-made
,
for
a
legendary
*NL*
cycle
,
if
any
of
us
had
had
the
epic
mind
.
At
daybreak
,
before
we
were
*NL*
dressed
,
without
rhyme
or
reason
,
save
for
the
pleasure
of
proving
the
*NL*
strength
of
our
solidarity
,
we
would
call
to
one
another
good-humoredly
,
*NL*
cordially
,
patriotically
,
``
Hurry
up
;
there
's
no
time
to
be
lost
;
do
n't
*NL*
forget
,
it
's
Saturday
!
''
while
my
aunt
,
gossiping
with
Fran√ßoise
,
and
*NL*
reflecting
that
the
day
would
be
even
longer
than
usual
,
would
say
,
``
You
*NL*
might
cook
them
a
nice
bit
of
veal
,
seeing
that
it
's
Saturday
.
''
If
,
at
*NL*
half-past
ten
,
some
one
absent-mindedly
pulled
out
a
watch
and
said
,
``
I
*NL*
say
,
an
hour-and-a-half
still
before
luncheon
,
''
everyone
else
would
*NL*
be
in
ecstasies
over
being
able
to
retort
at
once
:
``
Why
,
what
are
you
*NL*
thinking
about
?
Have
you
for-gotten
that
it
's
Saturday
?
''
And
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
later
we
would
still
be
laughing
,
and
reminding
ourselves
to
*NL*
go
up
and
tell
aunt
L√©onie
about
this
absurd
mistake
,
to
amuse
her
.
The
*NL*
very
face
of
the
sky
appeared
to
undergo
a
change
.
After
luncheon
the
*NL*
sun
,
conscious
that
it
was
Saturday
,
would
blaze
an
hour
longer
in
the
*NL*
zenith
,
and
when
some
one
,
thinking
that
we
were
late
in
starting
for
*NL*
our
walk
,
said
,
``
What
,
only
two
o'clock
!
''
feeling
the
heavy
throb
go
by
*NL*
him
of
the
twin
strokes
from
the
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
-LRB-
which
as
*NL*
a
rule
passed
no
one
at
that
hour
upon
the
highways
,
deserted
for
the
*NL*
midday
meal
or
for
the
nap
which
follows
it
,
or
on
the
banks
of
the
*NL*
bright
and
ever-flowing
stream
,
which
even
the
angler
had
abandoned
,
and
*NL*
so
slipped
unaccompanied
into
the
vacant
sky
,
where
only
a
few
loitering
*NL*
clouds
remained
to
greet
them
-RRB-
the
whole
family
would
respond
in
chorus
:
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
're
forgetting
;
we
had
luncheon
an
hour
earlier
;
you
know
very
*NL*
well
it
's
Saturday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
surprise
of
a
`
barbarian
'
-LRB-
for
so
we
termed
everyone
who
was
not
*NL*
acquainted
with
Saturday
's
special
customs
-RRB-
who
had
called
at
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
to
speak
to
my
father
,
and
had
found
us
at
table
,
was
an
event
*NL*
which
used
to
cause
Fran√ßoise
as
much
merriment
as
,
perhaps
,
anything
*NL*
that
had
ever
happened
in
her
life
.
And
if
she
found
it
amusing
that
the
*NL*
nonplussed
visitor
should
not
have
known
,
beforehand
,
that
we
had
our
*NL*
luncheon
an
hour
earlier
on
Saturday
,
it
was
still
more
irresistibly
*NL*
funny
that
my
father
himself
-LRB-
fully
as
she
sympathised
,
from
the
bottom
*NL*
of
her
heart
,
with
the
rigid
chauvinism
which
prompted
him
-RRB-
should
never
*NL*
have
dreamed
that
the
barbarian
could
fail
to
be
aware
of
so
simple
a
*NL*
matter
,
and
so
had
replied
,
with
no
further
enlightenment
of
the
*NL*
other
's
surprise
at
seeing
us
already
in
the
dining-room
:
``
You
see
,
it
's
*NL*
Saturday
.
''
On
reaching
this
point
in
the
story
,
Fran√ßoise
would
pause
to
*NL*
wipe
the
tears
of
merriment
from
her
eyes
,
and
then
,
to
add
to
her
own
*NL*
enjoyment
,
would
prolong
the
dialogue
,
inventing
a
further
reply
for
*NL*
the
visitor
to
whom
the
word
`
Saturday
'
had
conveyed
nothing
.
And
so
far
*NL*
from
our
objecting
to
these
interpolations
,
we
would
feel
that
the
story
*NL*
was
not
yet
long
enough
,
and
would
rally
her
with
:
``
Oh
,
but
surely
he
*NL*
said
something
else
as
well
.
There
was
more
than
that
,
the
first
time
*NL*
you
told
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
great-aunt
herself
would
lay
aside
her
work
,
and
raise
her
head
and
*NL*
look
on
at
us
over
her
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
had
yet
another
characteristic
feature
,
namely
,
that
during
May
*NL*
we
used
to
go
out
on
Saturday
evenings
after
dinner
to
the
`
Month
of
*NL*
Mary
'
devotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
were
liable
,
there
,
to
meet
M.
Vinteuil
,
who
held
very
strict
*NL*
views
on
``
the
deplorable
untidiness
of
young
people
,
which
seems
to
*NL*
be
encouraged
in
these
days
,
''
my
mother
would
first
see
that
there
was
*NL*
nothing
out
of
order
in
my
appearance
,
and
then
we
would
set
out
for
*NL*
the
church
.
It
was
in
these
`
Month
of
Mary
'
services
that
I
can
remember
*NL*
having
first
fallen
in
love
with
hawthorn-blossom
.
The
hawthorn
was
not
*NL*
merely
in
the
church
,
for
there
,
holy
ground
as
it
was
,
we
had
all
of
us
*NL*
a
right
of
entry
;
but
,
arranged
upon
the
altar
itself
,
inseparable
from
*NL*
the
mysteries
in
whose
celebration
it
was
playing
a
part
,
it
thrust
in
*NL*
among
the
tapers
and
the
sacred
vessels
its
rows
of
branches
,
tied
to
*NL*
one
another
horizontally
in
a
stiff
,
festal
scheme
of
decoration
;
and
*NL*
they
were
made
more
lovely
still
by
the
scalloped
outline
of
the
dark
*NL*
leaves
,
over
which
were
scattered
in
profusion
,
as
over
a
bridal
train
,
*NL*
little
clusters
of
buds
of
a
dazzling
whiteness
.
Though
I
dared
not
look
*NL*
at
them
save
through
my
fingers
,
I
could
feel
that
the
formal
scheme
*NL*
was
composed
of
living
things
,
and
that
it
was
Nature
herself
who
,
by
*NL*
trimming
the
shape
of
the
foliage
,
and
by
adding
the
crowning
ornament
*NL*
of
those
snowy
buds
,
had
made
the
decorations
worthy
of
what
was
at
*NL*
once
a
public
rejoicing
and
a
solemn
mystery
.
Higher
up
on
the
altar
,
*NL*
a
flower
had
opened
here
and
there
with
a
careless
grace
,
holding
so
*NL*
unconcernedly
,
like
a
final
,
almost
vaporous
bedizening
,
its
bunch
of
*NL*
stamens
,
slender
as
gossamer
,
which
clouded
the
flower
itself
in
a
*NL*
white
mist
,
that
in
following
these
with
my
eyes
,
in
trying
to
imitate
,
*NL*
somewhere
inside
myself
,
the
action
of
their
blossoming
,
I
imagined
it
*NL*
as
a
swift
and
thoughtless
movement
of
the
head
with
an
enticing
glance
*NL*
from
her
contracted
pupils
,
by
a
young
girl
in
white
,
careless
and
*NL*
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Vinteuil
had
come
in
with
his
daughter
and
had
sat
down
beside
us
.
*NL*
He
belonged
to
a
good
family
,
and
had
once
been
music-master
to
*NL*
my
grandmother
's
sisters
;
so
that
when
,
after
losing
his
wife
and
*NL*
inheriting
some
property
,
he
had
retired
to
the
neighbourhood
of
*NL*
Combray
,
we
used
often
to
invite
him
to
our
house
.
But
with
his
intense
*NL*
prudishness
he
had
given
up
coming
,
so
as
not
to
be
obliged
to
meet
*NL*
Swann
,
who
had
made
what
he
called
``
a
most
unsuitable
marriage
,
as
*NL*
seems
to
be
the
fashion
in
these
days
.
''
My
mother
,
on
hearing
that
he
*NL*
`
composed
,
'
told
him
by
way
of
a
compliment
that
,
when
she
came
to
see
*NL*
him
,
he
must
play
her
something
of
his
own
.
M.
Vinteuil
would
have
liked
*NL*
nothing
better
,
but
he
carried
politeness
and
consideration
for
others
*NL*
to
so
fine
a
point
,
always
putting
himself
in
their
place
,
that
he
was
*NL*
afraid
of
boring
them
,
or
of
appearing
egotistical
,
if
he
carried
out
,
*NL*
or
even
allowed
them
to
suspect
what
were
his
own
desires
.
On
the
day
*NL*
when
my
parents
had
gone
to
pay
him
a
visit
,
I
had
accompanied
them
,
*NL*
but
they
had
allowed
me
to
remain
outside
,
and
as
M.
Vinteuil
's
house
,
*NL*
Montjouvain
,
stood
on
a
site
actually
hollowed
out
from
a
steep
hill
*NL*
covered
with
shrubs
,
among
which
I
took
cover
,
I
had
found
myself
on
a
*NL*
level
with
his
drawing-room
,
upstairs
,
and
only
a
few
feet
away
from
its
*NL*
window
.
When
a
servant
came
in
to
tell
him
that
my
parents
had
arrived
,
*NL*
I
had
seen
M.
Vinteuil
run
to
the
piano
and
lay
out
a
sheet
of
music
*NL*
so
as
to
catch
the
eye
.
But
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
room
he
had
*NL*
snatched
it
away
and
hidden
it
in
a
corner
.
He
was
afraid
,
no
doubt
,
of
*NL*
letting
them
suppose
that
he
was
glad
to
see
them
only
because
it
gave
*NL*
him
a
chance
of
playing
them
some
of
his
compositions
.
And
every
time
*NL*
that
my
mother
,
in
the
course
of
her
visit
,
had
returned
to
the
subject
*NL*
of
his
playing
,
he
had
hurriedly
protested
:
``
I
can
not
think
who
put
that
*NL*
on
the
piano
;
it
is
not
the
proper
place
for
it
at
all
,
''
and
had
turned
*NL*
the
conversation
aside
to
other
topics
,
simply
because
those
were
of
*NL*
less
interest
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
one
and
only
passion
was
for
his
daughter
,
and
she
,
with
her
*NL*
somewhat
boyish
appearance
,
looked
so
robust
that
it
was
hard
to
*NL*
restrain
a
smile
when
one
saw
the
precautions
her
father
used
to
take
*NL*
for
her
health
,
with
spare
shawls
always
in
readiness
to
wrap
around
*NL*
her
shoulders
.
My
grandmother
had
drawn
our
attention
to
the
gentle
,
*NL*
delicate
,
almost
timid
expression
which
might
often
be
caught
flitting
*NL*
across
the
face
,
dusted
all
over
with
freckles
,
of
this
otherwise
stolid
*NL*
child
.
When
she
had
spoken
,
she
would
at
once
take
her
own
words
in
the
*NL*
sense
in
which
her
audience
must
have
heard
them
,
she
would
be
alarmed
*NL*
at
the
possibility
of
a
misunderstanding
,
and
one
would
see
,
in
clear
*NL*
outline
,
as
though
in
a
transparency
,
beneath
the
mannish
face
of
the
*NL*
`
good
sort
'
that
she
was
,
the
finer
features
of
a
young
woman
in
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
before
turning
to
leave
the
church
,
I
made
a
genuflection
before
*NL*
the
altar
,
I
felt
suddenly
,
as
I
rose
again
,
a
bitter-sweet
fragrance
of
*NL*
almonds
steal
towards
me
from
the
hawthorn-blossom
,
and
I
then
noticed
*NL*
that
on
the
flowers
themselves
were
little
spots
of
a
creamier
colour
,
*NL*
in
which
I
imagined
that
this
fragrance
must
lie
concealed
,
as
the
taste
*NL*
of
an
almond
cake
lay
in
the
burned
parts
,
or
the
sweetness
of
Mlle.
*NL*
Vinteuil
's
cheeks
beneath
their
freckles
.
Despite
the
heavy
,
motionless
*NL*
silence
of
the
hawthorns
,
these
gusts
of
fragrance
came
to
me
like
*NL*
the
murmuring
of
an
intense
vitality
,
with
which
the
whole
altar
was
*NL*
quivering
like
a
roadside
hedge
explored
by
living
antennae
,
of
which
I
*NL*
was
reminded
by
seeing
some
stamens
,
almost
red
in
colour
,
which
seemed
*NL*
to
have
kept
the
springtime
virulence
,
the
irritant
power
of
stinging
*NL*
insects
now
transmuted
into
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
church
we
would
stand
talking
for
a
moment
with
M.
Vinteuil
,
*NL*
in
the
porch
.
Boys
would
be
chevying
one
another
in
the
Square
,
and
he
*NL*
would
interfere
,
taking
the
side
of
the
little
ones
and
lecturing
the
*NL*
big
.
If
his
daughter
said
,
in
her
thick
,
comfortable
voice
,
how
glad
she
*NL*
had
been
to
see
us
,
immediately
it
would
seem
as
though
some
elder
and
*NL*
more
sensitive
sister
,
latent
in
her
,
had
blushed
at
this
thoughtless
,
*NL*
schoolboyish
utterance
,
which
had
,
perhaps
,
made
us
think
that
she
was
*NL*
angling
for
an
invitation
to
the
house
.
Her
father
would
then
arrange
*NL*
a
cloak
over
her
shoulders
,
they
would
clamber
into
a
little
dog-cart
*NL*
which
she
herself
drove
,
and
home
they
would
both
go
to
Montjouvain
.
*NL*
As
for
ourselves
,
the
next
day
being
Sunday
,
with
no
need
to
be
up
and
*NL*
stirring
before
high
mass
,
if
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
warm
,
then
,
*NL*
instead
of
taking
us
home
at
once
,
my
father
,
in
his
thirst
for
personal
*NL*
distinction
,
would
lead
us
on
a
long
walk
round
by
the
Calvary
,
which
my
*NL*
mother
's
utter
incapacity
for
taking
her
bearings
,
or
even
for
knowing
*NL*
which
road
she
might
be
on
,
made
her
regard
as
a
triumph
of
his
*NL*
strategic
genius
.
Sometimes
we
would
go
as
far
as
the
viaduct
,
which
*NL*
began
to
stride
on
its
long
legs
of
stone
at
the
railway
station
,
and
*NL*
to
me
typified
all
the
wretchedness
of
exile
beyond
the
last
outposts
of
*NL*
civilisation
,
because
every
year
,
as
we
came
down
from
Paris
,
we
would
*NL*
be
warned
to
take
special
care
,
when
we
got
to
Combray
,
not
to
miss
*NL*
the
station
,
to
be
ready
before
the
train
stopped
,
since
it
would
start
*NL*
again
in
two
minutes
and
proceed
across
the
viaduct
,
out
of
the
lands
of
*NL*
Christendom
,
of
which
Combray
,
to
me
,
represented
the
farthest
limit
.
*NL*
We
would
return
by
the
Boulevard
de
la
Gare
,
which
contained
the
most
*NL*
attractive
villas
in
the
town
.
In
each
of
their
gardens
the
moonlight
,
*NL*
copying
the
art
of
Hubert
Robert
,
had
scattered
its
broken
staircases
*NL*
of
white
marble
,
its
fountains
of
water
and
gates
temptingly
ajar
.
Its
*NL*
beams
had
swept
away
the
telegraph
office
.
All
that
was
left
of
it
was
*NL*
a
column
,
half
shattered
,
but
preserving
the
beauty
of
a
ruin
which
*NL*
endures
for
all
time
.
I
would
by
now
be
dragging
my
weary
limbs
,
and
*NL*
ready
to
drop
with
sleep
;
the
balmy
scent
of
the
lime-trees
seemed
a
*NL*
consolation
which
I
could
obtain
only
at
the
price
of
great
suffering
*NL*
and
exhaustion
,
and
not
worthy
of
the
effort
.
From
gates
far
apart
*NL*
the
watchdogs
,
awakened
by
our
steps
in
the
silence
,
would
set
up
*NL*
an
antiphonal
barking
,
as
I
still
hear
them
bark
,
at
times
,
in
the
*NL*
evenings
,
and
it
is
in
their
custody
-LRB-
when
the
public
gardens
of
Combray
*NL*
were
constructed
on
its
site
-RRB-
that
the
Boulevard
de
la
Gare
must
*NL*
have
taken
refuge
,
for
wherever
I
may
be
,
as
soon
as
they
begin
their
*NL*
alternate
challenge
and
acceptance
,
I
can
see
it
again
with
all
its
*NL*
lime-trees
,
and
its
pavement
glistening
beneath
the
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
my
father
would
bring
us
to
a
standstill
and
ask
my
*NL*
mother
--
``
Where
are
we
?
''
Utterly
worn
out
by
the
walk
but
still
proud
of
*NL*
her
husband
,
she
would
lovingly
confess
that
she
had
not
the
least
*NL*
idea
.
He
would
shrug
his
shoulders
and
laugh
.
And
then
,
as
though
it
had
*NL*
slipped
,
with
his
latchkey
,
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
he
would
point
*NL*
out
to
us
,
when
it
stood
before
our
eyes
,
the
back-gate
of
our
own
*NL*
garden
,
which
had
come
hand-in-hand
with
the
familiar
corner
of
the
Rue
*NL*
du
Saint-Esprit
,
to
await
us
,
to
greet
us
at
the
end
of
our
wanderings
*NL*
over
paths
unknown
.
My
mother
would
murmur
admiringly
``
You
really
are
*NL*
wonderful
!
''
And
from
that
instant
I
had
not
to
take
another
step
;
the
*NL*
ground
moved
forward
under
my
feet
in
that
garden
where
,
for
so
long
,
*NL*
my
actions
had
ceased
to
require
any
control
,
or
even
attention
,
from
my
*NL*
will
.
Custom
came
to
take
me
in
her
arms
,
carried
me
all
the
way
up
to
*NL*
my
bed
,
and
laid
me
down
there
like
a
little
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Saturday
,
by
beginning
an
hour
earlier
,
and
by
depriving
her
*NL*
of
the
services
of
Fran√ßoise
,
passed
more
slowly
than
other
days
for
my
*NL*
aunt
,
yet
,
the
moment
it
was
past
,
and
a
new
week
begun
,
she
would
look
*NL*
forward
with
impatience
to
its
return
,
as
something
that
embodied
all
*NL*
the
novelty
and
distraction
which
her
frail
and
disordered
body
was
*NL*
still
able
to
endure
.
This
was
not
to
say
,
however
,
that
she
did
not
*NL*
long
,
at
times
,
for
some
even
greater
variation
,
that
she
did
not
*NL*
pass
through
those
abnormal
hours
in
which
one
thirsts
for
something
*NL*
different
from
what
one
has
,
when
those
people
who
,
through
lack
of
*NL*
energy
or
imagination
,
are
unable
to
generate
any
motive
power
in
*NL*
themselves
,
cry
out
,
as
the
clock
strikes
or
the
postman
knocks
,
in
*NL*
their
eagerness
for
news
-LRB-
even
if
it
be
bad
news
-RRB-
,
for
some
emotion
*NL*
-LRB-
even
that
of
grief
-RRB-
;
when
the
heartstrings
,
which
prosperity
has
*NL*
silenced
,
like
a
harp
laid
by
,
yearn
to
be
plucked
and
sounded
again
*NL*
by
some
hand
,
even
a
brutal
hand
,
even
if
it
shall
break
them
;
when
*NL*
the
will
,
which
has
with
such
difficulty
brought
itself
to
subdue
its
*NL*
impulse
,
to
renounce
its
right
to
abandon
itself
to
its
own
uncontrolled
*NL*
desires
,
and
consequent
sufferings
,
would
fain
cast
its
guiding
reins
*NL*
into
the
hands
of
circumstances
,
coercive
and
,
it
may
be
,
cruel
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
since
my
aunt
's
strength
,
which
was
completely
drained
by
the
*NL*
slightest
exertion
,
returned
but
drop
by
drop
into
the
pool
of
her
*NL*
repose
,
the
reservoir
was
very
slow
in
filling
,
and
months
would
go
by
*NL*
before
she
reached
that
surplus
which
other
people
use
up
in
their
daily
*NL*
activities
,
but
which
she
had
no
idea
--
and
could
never
decide
how
to
*NL*
employ
.
And
I
have
no
doubt
that
then
--
just
as
a
desire
to
have
her
*NL*
potatoes
served
with
b√©chamel
sauce
,
for
a
change
,
would
be
formed
,
*NL*
ultimately
,
from
the
pleasure
she
found
in
the
daily
reappearance
of
*NL*
those
mashed
potatoes
of
which
she
was
never
`
tired
'
--
she
would
extract
*NL*
from
the
accumulation
of
those
monotonous
days
-LRB-
on
which
she
so
much
*NL*
depended
-RRB-
a
keen
expectation
of
some
domestic
cataclysm
,
instantaneous
*NL*
in
its
happening
,
but
violent
enough
to
compel
her
to
put
into
effect
,
*NL*
once
for
all
,
one
of
those
changes
which
she
knew
would
be
beneficial
to
*NL*
her
health
,
but
to
which
she
could
never
make
up
her
mind
without
some
*NL*
such
stimulus
.
She
was
genuinely
fond
of
us
;
she
would
have
enjoyed
the
*NL*
long
luxury
of
weeping
for
our
untimely
decease
;
coming
at
a
moment
when
*NL*
she
felt
`
well
'
and
was
not
in
a
perspiration
,
the
news
that
the
house
*NL*
was
being
destroyed
by
a
fire
,
in
which
all
the
rest
of
us
had
already
*NL*
perished
,
a
fire
which
,
in
a
little
while
,
would
not
leave
one
stone
*NL*
standing
upon
another
,
but
from
which
she
herself
would
still
have
*NL*
plenty
of
time
to
escape
without
undue
haste
,
provided
that
she
rose
*NL*
at
once
from
her
bed
,
must
often
have
haunted
her
dreams
,
as
a
prospect
*NL*
which
combined
with
the
two
minor
advantages
of
letting
her
taste
the
*NL*
full
savour
of
her
affection
for
us
in
long
years
of
mourning
,
and
of
*NL*
causing
universal
stupefaction
in
the
village
when
she
should
sally
*NL*
forth
to
conduct
our
obsequies
,
crushed
but
courageous
,
moribund
but
*NL*
erect
,
the
paramount
and
priceless
boon
of
forcing
her
at
the
right
*NL*
moment
,
with
no
time
to
be
lost
,
no
room
for
weakening
hesitations
,
to
*NL*
go
off
and
spend
the
summer
at
her
charming
farm
of
Mirougrain
,
where
*NL*
there
was
a
waterfall
.
Inasmuch
as
nothing
of
this
sort
had
ever
*NL*
occurred
,
though
indeed
she
must
often
have
pondered
the
success
of
*NL*
such
a
manoeuvre
as
she
lay
alone
absorbed
in
her
interminable
games
of
*NL*
patience
-LRB-
and
though
it
must
have
plunged
her
in
despair
from
the
first
*NL*
moment
of
its
realisation
,
from
the
first
of
those
little
unforeseen
*NL*
facts
,
the
first
word
of
calamitous
news
,
whose
accents
can
never
*NL*
afterwards
be
expunged
from
the
memory
,
everything
that
bears
upon
it
*NL*
the
imprint
of
actual
,
physical
death
,
so
terribly
different
from
the
*NL*
logical
abstraction
of
its
possibility
-RRB-
she
would
fall
back
from
time
*NL*
to
time
,
to
add
an
interest
to
her
life
,
upon
imagining
other
,
minor
*NL*
catastrophes
,
which
she
would
follow
up
with
passion
.
She
would
beguile
*NL*
herself
with
a
sudden
suspicion
that
Fran√ßoise
had
been
robbing
her
,
*NL*
that
she
had
set
a
trap
to
make
certain
,
and
had
caught
her
betrayer
*NL*
red-handed
;
and
being
in
the
habit
,
when
she
made
up
a
game
of
cards
by
*NL*
herself
,
of
playing
her
own
and
her
adversary
's
hands
at
once
,
she
would
*NL*
first
stammer
out
Fran√ßoise
's
awkward
apologies
,
and
then
reply
to
them
*NL*
with
such
a
fiery
indignation
that
any
of
us
who
happened
to
intrude
*NL*
upon
her
at
one
of
these
moments
would
find
her
bathed
in
perspiration
,
*NL*
her
eyes
blazing
,
her
false
hair
pushed
awry
and
exposing
the
baldness
*NL*
of
her
brows
.
Fran√ßoise
must
often
,
from
the
next
room
,
have
heard
these
*NL*
mordant
sarcasms
levelled
at
herself
,
the
mere
framing
of
which
in
words
*NL*
would
not
have
relieved
my
aunt
's
feelings
sufficiently
,
had
they
been
*NL*
allowed
to
remain
in
a
purely
immaterial
form
,
without
the
degree
*NL*
of
substance
and
reality
which
she
added
to
them
by
murmuring
them
*NL*
half-aloud
.
Sometimes
,
however
,
even
these
counterpane
dramas
would
not
*NL*
satisfy
my
aunt
;
she
must
see
her
work
staged
.
And
so
,
on
a
Sunday
,
*NL*
with
all
the
doors
mysteriously
closed
,
she
would
confide
in
Eulalie
her
*NL*
doubts
of
Fran√ßoise
's
integrity
and
her
determination
to
be
rid
of
her
,
*NL*
and
on
another
day
she
would
confide
in
Fran√ßoise
her
suspicions
of
the
*NL*
disloyalty
of
Eulalie
,
to
whom
the
front-door
would
very
soon
be
closed
*NL*
for
good
.
A
few
days
more
,
and
,
disgusted
with
her
latest
confidant
,
she
*NL*
would
again
be
`
as
thick
as
thieves
'
with
the
traitor
,
while
,
before
the
*NL*
next
performance
,
the
two
would
once
more
have
changed
their
parts
.
But
*NL*
the
suspicions
which
Eulalie
might
occasionally
breed
in
her
were
no
*NL*
more
than
a
fire
of
straw
,
which
must
soon
subside
for
lack
of
fuel
,
*NL*
since
Eulalie
was
not
living
with
her
in
the
house
.
It
was
a
very
*NL*
different
matter
when
the
suspect
was
Fran√ßoise
,
of
whose
presence
under
*NL*
the
same
roof
as
herself
my
aunt
was
perpetually
conscious
,
while
for
*NL*
fear
of
catching
cold
,
were
she
to
leave
her
bed
,
she
would
never
dare
*NL*
go
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
to
see
for
herself
whether
there
was
,
*NL*
indeed
,
any
foundation
for
her
suspicions
.
And
so
on
by
degrees
,
until
*NL*
her
mind
had
no
other
occupation
than
to
attempt
,
at
every
hour
of
the
*NL*
day
,
to
discover
what
was
being
done
,
what
was
being
concealed
from
her
*NL*
by
Fran√ßoise
.
She
would
detect
the
most
furtive
movement
of
Fran√ßoise
's
*NL*
features
,
something
contradictory
in
what
she
was
saying
,
some
desire
*NL*
which
she
appeared
to
be
screening
.
And
she
would
shew
her
that
she
was
*NL*
unmasked
,
by
,
a
single
word
,
which
made
Fran√ßoise
turn
pale
,
and
which
*NL*
my
aunt
seemed
to
find
a
cruel
satisfaction
in
driving
into
her
unhappy
*NL*
servant
's
heart
.
And
the
very
next
Sunday
a
disclosure
by
Eulalie
--
like
*NL*
one
of
those
discoveries
which
suddenly
open
up
an
unsuspected
field
*NL*
for
exploration
to
some
new
science
which
has
hitherto
followed
only
*NL*
the
beaten
paths
--
proved
to
my
aunt
that
her
own
worst
suspicions
fell
*NL*
a
long
way
short
of
the
appalling
truth
.
``
But
Fran√ßoise
ought
to
know
*NL*
that
,
''
said
Eulalie
,
``
now
that
you
have
given
her
a
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
I
have
given
her
a
carriage
!
''
gasped
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
did
n't
know
;
I
only
thought
so
;
I
saw
her
go
by
yesterday
in
*NL*
her
open
coach
,
as
proud
as
Artaban
,
on
her
way
to
Roussainville
market
.
*NL*
I
supposed
that
it
must
be
Mme.
Octave
who
had
given
it
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
on
by
degrees
,
until
Fran√ßoise
and
my
aunt
,
the
quarry
and
the
*NL*
hunter
,
could
never
cease
from
trying
to
forestall
each
other
's
devices
.
*NL*
My
mother
was
afraid
lest
Fran√ßoise
should
develop
a
genuine
hatred
of
*NL*
my
aunt
,
who
was
doing
everything
in
her
power
to
annoy
her
.
However
*NL*
that
might
be
,
Fran√ßoise
had
come
,
more
and
more
,
to
pay
an
infinitely
*NL*
scrupulous
attention
to
my
aunt
's
least
word
and
gesture
.
When
she
had
*NL*
to
ask
her
for
anything
she
would
hesitate
,
first
,
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
making
up
her
mind
how
best
to
begin
.
And
when
she
had
uttered
her
*NL*
request
,
she
would
watch
my
aunt
covertly
,
trying
to
guess
from
the
*NL*
expression
on
her
face
what
she
thought
of
it
,
and
how
she
would
reply
.
*NL*
And
in
this
way
--
whereas
an
artist
who
had
been
reading
memoirs
of
the
*NL*
seventeenth
century
,
and
wished
to
bring
himself
nearer
to
the
great
*NL*
Louis
,
would
consider
that
he
was
making
progress
in
that
direction
when
*NL*
he
constructed
a
pedigree
that
traced
his
own
descent
from
some
historic
*NL*
family
,
or
when
he
engaged
in
correspondence
with
one
of
the
reigning
*NL*
Sovereigns
of
Europe
,
and
so
would
shut
his
eyes
to
the
mistake
he
was
*NL*
making
in
seeking
to
establish
a
similarity
by
an
exact
and
therefore
*NL*
lifeless
copy
of
mere
outward
forms
--
a
middle-aged
lady
in
a
small
*NL*
country
town
,
by
doing
no
more
than
yield
whole-hearted
obedience
to
her
*NL*
own
irresistible
eccentricities
,
and
to
a
spirit
of
mischief
engendered
*NL*
by
the
utter
idleness
of
her
existence
,
could
see
,
without
ever
having
*NL*
given
a
thought
to
Louis
XIV
,
the
most
trivial
occupations
of
her
daily
*NL*
life
,
her
morning
toilet
,
her
luncheon
,
her
afternoon
nap
,
assume
,
by
*NL*
virtue
of
their
despotic
singularity
,
something
of
the
interest
that
was
*NL*
to
be
found
in
what
Saint-Simon
used
to
call
the
`
machinery
'
of
life
at
*NL*
Versailles
;
and
was
able
,
too
,
to
persuade
herself
that
her
silence
,
*NL*
a
shade
of
good
humour
or
of
arrogance
on
her
features
,
would
provide
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
with
matter
for
a
mental
commentary
as
tense
with
passion
and
*NL*
terror
,
as
did
the
silence
,
the
good
humour
or
the
arrogance
of
the
King
*NL*
when
a
courtier
,
or
even
his
greatest
nobles
,
had
presented
a
petition
*NL*
to
him
,
at
the
turning
of
an
avenue
,
at
Versailles
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Sunday
,
when
my
aunt
had
received
simultaneous
visits
from
the
Cur√©
*NL*
and
from
Eulalie
,
and
had
been
left
alone
,
afterwards
,
to
rest
,
the
*NL*
whole
family
went
upstairs
to
bid
her
good
night
,
and
Mamma
ventured
*NL*
to
condole
with
her
on
the
unlucky
coincidence
that
always
brought
both
*NL*
visitors
to
her
door
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
that
things
went
wrong
again
to-day
,
L√©onie
,
''
she
said
kindly
,
*NL*
``
you
have
had
all
your
friends
here
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
my
great-aunt
interrupted
with
:
``
Too
many
good
things
...
''
for
,
since
*NL*
her
daughter
's
illness
,
she
felt
herself
in
duty
bound
to
revive
her
as
*NL*
far
as
possible
by
always
drawing
her
attention
to
the
brighter
side
of
*NL*
things
.
But
my
father
had
begun
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
take
advantage
,
''
he
said
,
``
of
the
whole
family
's
being
*NL*
here
together
,
to
tell
you
a
story
,
so
as
not
to
have
to
begin
all
over
*NL*
again
to
each
of
you
separately
.
I
am
afraid
we
are
in
M.
Legrandin
's
*NL*
bad
books
;
he
would
hardly
say
`
How
d'ye
do
'
to
me
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
end
of
my
father
's
story
,
for
I
had
been
with
*NL*
him
myself
after
mass
when
we
had
passed
M.
Legrandin
;
instead
,
I
went
*NL*
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
to
ask
for
the
bill
of
fare
for
our
dinner
,
*NL*
which
was
of
fresh
interest
to
me
daily
,
like
the
news
in
a
paper
,
and
*NL*
excited
me
as
might
the
programme
of
a
coming
festivity
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
M.
Legrandin
had
passed
close
by
us
on
our
way
from
church
,
*NL*
walking
by
the
side
of
a
lady
,
the
owner
of
a
country
house
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
whom
we
knew
only
by
sight
,
my
father
had
saluted
him
in
*NL*
a
manner
at
once
friendly
and
reserved
,
without
stopping
in
his
walk
;
M.
*NL*
Legrandin
had
barely
acknowledged
the
courtesy
,
and
then
with
an
air
of
*NL*
surprise
,
as
though
he
had
not
recognised
us
,
and
with
that
distant
look
*NL*
characteristic
of
people
who
do
not
wish
to
be
agreeable
,
and
who
from
*NL*
the
suddenly
receding
depths
of
their
eyes
seem
to
have
caught
sight
of
*NL*
you
at
the
far
end
of
an
interminably
straight
road
,
and
at
so
great
*NL*
a
distance
that
they
content
themselves
with
directing
towards
you
*NL*
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
of
the
head
,
in
proportion
to
your
*NL*
doll-like
dimensions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
lady
who
was
walking
with
Legrandin
was
a
model
of
virtue
,
*NL*
known
and
highly
respected
;
there
could
be
no
question
of
his
being
*NL*
out
for
amorous
adventure
,
and
annoyed
at
being
detected
;
and
my
father
*NL*
asked
himself
how
he
could
possibly
have
displeased
our
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
all
the
more
sorry
to
feel
that
he
was
angry
with
us
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
because
among
all
those
people
in
their
Sunday
clothes
there
*NL*
is
something
about
him
,
with
his
little
cut-away
coat
and
his
soft
*NL*
neckties
,
so
little
`
dressed-up
,
'
so
genuinely
simple
;
an
air
of
*NL*
innocence
,
almost
,
which
is
really
attractive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
vote
of
the
family
council
was
unanimous
,
that
my
father
had
*NL*
imagined
the
whole
thing
,
or
that
Legrandin
,
at
the
moment
in
question
,
*NL*
had
been
preoccupied
in
thinking
about
something
else
.
Anyhow
,
my
*NL*
father
's
fears
were
dissipated
no
later
than
the
following
evening
.
*NL*
As
we
returned
from
a
long
walk
we
saw
,
near
the
Pont-Vieux
,
Legrandin
*NL*
himself
,
who
,
on
account
of
the
holidays
,
was
spending
a
few
days
more
*NL*
in
Combray
.
He
came
up
to
us
with
outstretched
hand
:
``
Do
you
know
,
*NL*
master
book-lover
,
''
he
asked
me
,
``
this
line
of
Paul
Desjardins
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
are
the
woods
all
black
,
but
still
the
sky
is
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
not
that
a
fine
rendering
of
a
moment
like
this
?
Perhaps
you
have
*NL*
never
read
Paul
Desjardins
.
Read
him
,
my
boy
,
read
him
;
in
these
days
he
*NL*
is
converted
,
they
tell
me
,
into
a
preaching
friar
,
but
he
used
to
have
*NL*
the
most
charming
water-colour
touch
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
are
the
woods
all
black
,
but
still
the
sky
is
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
you
always
see
a
blue
sky
overhead
,
my
young
friend
;
and
then
,
even
*NL*
when
the
time
comes
,
which
is
coming
now
for
me
,
when
the
woods
are
all
*NL*
black
,
when
night
is
fast
falling
,
you
will
be
able
to
console
yourself
,
*NL*
as
I
am
doing
,
by
looking
up
to
the
sky
.
''
He
took
a
cigarette
from
*NL*
his
pocket
and
stood
for
a
long
time
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
horizon
.
*NL*
``
Goodbye
,
friends
!
''
he
suddenly
exclaimed
,
and
left
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
hour
when
I
usually
went
downstairs
to
find
out
what
there
was
*NL*
for
dinner
,
its
preparation
would
already
have
begun
,
and
Fran√ßoise
,
*NL*
a
colonel
with
all
the
forces
of
nature
for
her
subalterns
,
as
in
the
*NL*
fairy-tales
where
giants
hire
themselves
out
as
scullions
,
would
be
*NL*
stirring
the
coals
,
putting
the
potatoes
to
steam
,
and
,
at
the
right
*NL*
moment
,
finishing
over
the
fire
those
culinary
masterpieces
which
had
*NL*
been
first
got
ready
in
some
of
the
great
array
of
vessels
,
triumphs
of
*NL*
the
potter
's
craft
,
which
ranged
from
tubs
and
boilers
and
cauldrons
*NL*
and
fish
kettles
down
to
jars
for
game
,
moulds
for
pastry
,
and
tiny
*NL*
pannikins
for
cream
,
and
included
an
entire
collection
of
pots
and
*NL*
pans
of
every
shape
and
size
.
I
would
stop
by
the
table
,
where
the
*NL*
kitchen-maid
had
shelled
them
,
to
inspect
the
platoons
of
peas
,
drawn
up
*NL*
in
ranks
and
numbered
,
like
little
green
marbles
,
ready
for
a
game
;
but
*NL*
what
fascinated
me
would
be
the
asparagus
,
tinged
with
ultramarine
*NL*
and
rosy
pink
which
ran
from
their
heads
,
finely
stippled
in
mauve
and
*NL*
azure
,
through
a
series
of
imperceptible
changes
to
their
white
*NL*
feet
,
still
stained
a
little
by
the
soil
of
their
garden-bed
:
a
*NL*
rainbow-loveliness
that
was
not
of
this
world
.
I
felt
that
these
*NL*
celestial
hues
indicated
the
presence
of
exquisite
creatures
who
had
*NL*
been
pleased
to
assume
vegetable
form
,
who
,
through
the
disguise
which
*NL*
covered
their
firm
and
edible
flesh
,
allowed
me
to
discern
in
this
*NL*
radiance
of
earliest
dawn
,
these
hinted
rainbows
,
these
blue
evening
*NL*
shades
,
that
precious
quality
which
I
should
recognise
again
when
,
all
*NL*
night
long
after
a
dinner
at
which
I
had
partaken
of
them
,
they
played
*NL*
-LRB-
lyrical
and
coarse
in
their
jesting
as
the
fairies
in
Shakespeare
's
*NL*
_
Dream
_
-RRB-
at
transforming
my
humble
chamber
into
a
bower
of
aromatic
*NL*
perfume
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Giotto
's
Charity
,
as
Swann
had
named
her
,
charged
by
Fran√ßoise
with
*NL*
the
task
of
preparing
them
for
the
table
,
would
have
them
lying
beside
*NL*
her
in
a
basket
;
sitting
with
a
mournful
air
,
as
though
all
the
sorrows
*NL*
of
the
world
were
heaped
upon
her
;
and
the
light
crowns
of
azure
which
*NL*
capped
the
asparagus
shoots
above
their
pink
jackets
would
be
finely
and
*NL*
separately
outlined
,
star
by
star
,
as
in
Giotto
's
fresco
are
the
flowers
*NL*
banded
about
the
brows
,
or
patterning
the
basket
of
his
Virtue
at
Padua
.
*NL*
And
,
meanwhile
,
Fran√ßoise
would
be
turning
on
the
spit
one
of
those
*NL*
chickens
,
such
as
she
alone
knew
how
to
roast
,
chickens
which
had
wafted
*NL*
far
abroad
from
Combray
the
sweet
savour
of
her
merits
,
and
which
,
while
*NL*
she
was
serving
them
to
us
at
table
,
would
make
the
quality
of
kindness
*NL*
predominate
for
the
moment
in
my
private
conception
of
her
character
;
*NL*
the
aroma
of
that
cooked
flesh
,
which
she
knew
how
to
make
so
unctuous
*NL*
and
so
tender
,
seeming
to
me
no
more
than
the
proper
perfume
of
one
of
*NL*
her
many
virtues
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
day
on
which
,
while
my
father
took
counsel
with
his
family
upon
*NL*
our
strange
meeting
with
Legrandin
,
I
went
down
to
the
kitchen
,
was
one
*NL*
of
those
days
when
Giotto
's
Charity
,
still
very
weak
and
ill
after
her
*NL*
recent
confinement
,
had
been
unable
to
rise
from
her
bed
;
Fran√ßoise
,
*NL*
being
without
assistance
,
had
fallen
into
arrears
.
When
I
went
in
,
I
saw
*NL*
her
in
the
back-kitchen
which
opened
on
to
the
courtyard
,
in
process
of
*NL*
killing
a
chicken
;
by
its
desperate
and
quite
natural
resistance
,
which
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
,
beside
herself
with
rage
as
she
attempted
to
slit
its
throat
*NL*
beneath
the
ear
,
accompanied
with
shrill
cries
of
``
Filthy
creature
!
*NL*
Filthy
creature
!
''
it
made
the
saintly
kindness
and
unction
of
our
*NL*
servant
rather
less
prominent
than
it
would
do
,
next
day
at
dinner
,
when
*NL*
it
made
its
appearance
in
a
skin
gold-embroidered
like
a
chasuble
,
and
*NL*
its
precious
juice
was
poured
out
drop
by
drop
as
from
a
pyx
.
When
it
*NL*
was
dead
Fran√ßoise
mopped
up
its
streaming
blood
,
in
which
,
however
,
*NL*
she
did
not
let
her
rancour
drown
,
for
she
gave
vent
to
another
burst
*NL*
of
rage
,
and
,
gazing
down
at
the
carcass
of
her
enemy
,
uttered
a
final
*NL*
``
Filthy
creature
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
crept
out
of
the
kitchen
and
upstairs
,
trembling
all
over
;
I
could
*NL*
have
prayed
,
then
,
for
the
instant
dismissal
of
Fran√ßoise
.
But
who
*NL*
would
have
baked
me
such
hot
rolls
,
boiled
me
such
fragrant
coffee
,
and
*NL*
even
--
roasted
me
such
chickens
?
And
,
as
it
happened
,
everyone
else
had
*NL*
already
had
to
make
the
same
cowardly
reckoning
.
For
my
aunt
L√©onie
knew
*NL*
-LRB-
though
I
was
still
in
ignorance
of
this
-RRB-
that
Fran√ßoise
,
who
,
for
her
*NL*
own
daughter
or
for
her
nephews
,
would
have
given
her
life
without
a
*NL*
murmur
,
shewed
a
singular
implacability
in
her
dealings
with
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
world
.
In
spite
of
which
my
aunt
still
retained
her
,
for
,
while
*NL*
conscious
of
her
cruelty
,
she
could
appreciate
her
services
.
I
began
*NL*
gradually
to
realise
that
Fran√ßoise
's
kindness
,
her
compunction
,
the
*NL*
sum
total
of
her
virtues
concealed
many
of
these
back-kitchen
tragedies
,
*NL*
just
as
history
reveals
to
us
that
the
reigns
of
the
kings
and
queens
*NL*
who
are
portrayed
as
kneeling
with
clasped
hands
in
the
windows
of
*NL*
churches
,
were
stained
by
oppression
and
bloodshed
.
I
had
taken
note
of
*NL*
the
fact
that
,
apart
from
her
own
kinsfolk
,
the
sufferings
of
humanity
*NL*
inspired
in
her
a
pity
which
increased
in
direct
ratio
to
the
distance
*NL*
separating
the
sufferers
from
herself
.
The
tears
which
flowed
from
her
*NL*
in
torrents
when
she
read
of
the
misfortunes
of
persons
unknown
to
her
,
*NL*
in
a
newspaper
,
were
quickly
stemmed
once
she
had
been
able
to
form
a
*NL*
more
accurate
mental
picture
of
the
victims
.
One
night
,
shortly
after
*NL*
her
confinement
,
the
kitchen-maid
was
seized
with
the
most
appalling
*NL*
pains
;
Mamma
heard
her
groans
,
and
rose
and
awakened
Fran√ßoise
,
who
,
*NL*
quite
unmoved
,
declared
that
all
the
outcry
was
mere
malingering
,
that
*NL*
the
girl
wanted
to
`
play
the
mistress
'
in
the
house
.
The
doctor
,
who
*NL*
had
been
afraid
of
some
such
attack
,
had
left
a
marker
in
a
medical
*NL*
dictionary
which
we
had
,
at
the
page
on
which
the
symptoms
were
*NL*
described
,
and
had
told
us
to
turn
up
this
passage
,
where
we
would
find
*NL*
the
measures
of
`
first
aid
'
to
be
adopted
.
My
mother
sent
Fran√ßoise
*NL*
to
fetch
the
book
,
warning
her
not
to
let
the
marker
drop
out
.
An
hour
*NL*
elapsed
,
and
Fran√ßoise
had
not
returned
;
my
mother
,
supposing
that
*NL*
she
had
gone
back
to
bed
,
grew
vexed
,
and
told
me
to
go
myself
to
the
*NL*
bookcase
and
fetch
the
volume
.
I
did
so
,
and
there
found
Fran√ßoise
who
,
*NL*
in
her
curiosity
to
know
what
the
marker
indicated
,
had
begun
to
read
*NL*
the
clinical
account
of
these
after-pains
,
and
was
violently
sobbing
,
*NL*
now
that
it
was
a
question
of
a
type
of
illness
with
which
she
was
not
*NL*
familiar
.
At
each
painful
symptom
mentioned
by
the
writer
she
would
*NL*
exclaim
:
``
Oh
,
oh
,
Holy
Virgin
,
is
it
possible
that
God
wishes
any
*NL*
wretched
human
creature
to
suffer
so
?
Oh
,
the
poor
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
I
had
called
her
,
and
she
had
returned
to
the
bedside
of
*NL*
Giotto
's
Charity
,
her
tears
at
once
ceased
to
flow
;
she
could
find
no
*NL*
stimulus
for
that
pleasant
sensation
of
tenderness
and
pity
which
she
*NL*
very
well
knew
,
having
been
moved
to
it
often
enough
by
the
perusal
*NL*
of
newspapers
;
nor
any
other
pleasure
of
the
same
kind
in
her
sense
of
*NL*
weariness
and
irritation
at
being
pulled
out
of
bed
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
night
for
the
kitchen-maid
;
so
that
at
the
sight
of
those
very
*NL*
sufferings
,
the
printed
account
of
which
had
moved
her
to
tears
,
she
*NL*
had
nothing
to
offer
but
ill-tempered
mutterings
,
mingled
with
bitter
*NL*
sarcasm
,
saying
,
when
she
thought
that
we
had
gone
out
of
earshot
:
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
need
never
have
done
what
she
must
have
done
to
bring
all
*NL*
this
about
!
She
found
that
pleasant
enough
,
I
dare
say
!
She
had
better
*NL*
not
put
on
any
airs
now
.
All
the
same
,
he
must
have
been
a
god-forsaken
*NL*
young
man
to
go
after
_
that
_
.
Dear
,
dear
,
it
's
just
as
they
used
to
say
*NL*
in
my
poor
mother
's
country
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Snaps
and
snails
and
puppy-dogs
'
tails
,
*NL*
And
dirty
sluts
in
plenty
,
*NL*
Smell
sweeter
than
roses
in
young
men
's
noses
*NL*
When
the
heart
is
one-and-twenty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
,
when
her
grandson
had
a
slight
cold
in
his
head
,
she
would
set
*NL*
off
at
night
,
even
if
she
were
ill
also
,
instead
of
going
to
bed
,
to
*NL*
see
whether
he
had
everything
that
he
wanted
,
covering
ten
miles
on
foot
*NL*
before
daybreak
so
as
to
be
in
time
to
begin
her
work
,
this
same
love
*NL*
for
her
own
people
,
and
her
desire
to
establish
the
future
greatness
of
*NL*
her
house
on
a
solid
foundation
reacted
,
in
her
policy
with
regard
to
*NL*
the
other
servants
,
in
one
unvarying
maxim
,
which
was
never
to
let
any
*NL*
of
them
set
foot
in
my
aunt
's
room
;
indeed
she
shewed
a
sort
of
pride
*NL*
in
not
allowing
anyone
else
to
come
near
my
aunt
,
preferring
,
when
she
*NL*
herself
was
ill
,
to
get
out
of
bed
and
to
administer
the
Vichy
water
in
*NL*
person
,
rather
than
to
concede
to
the
kitchen-maid
the
right
of
entry
*NL*
into
her
mistress
's
presence
.
There
is
a
species
of
hymenoptera
,
*NL*
observed
by
Fabre
,
the
burrowing
wasp
,
which
in
order
to
provide
a
*NL*
supply
of
fresh
meat
for
her
offspring
after
her
own
decease
,
calls
*NL*
in
the
science
of
anatomy
to
amplify
the
resources
of
her
instinctive
*NL*
cruelty
,
and
,
having
made
a
collection
of
weevils
and
spiders
,
proceeds
*NL*
with
marvellous
knowledge
and
skill
to
pierce
the
nerve-centre
on
which
*NL*
their
power
of
locomotion
-LRB-
but
none
of
their
other
vital
functions
-RRB-
*NL*
depends
,
so
that
the
paralysed
insect
,
beside
which
her
egg
is
laid
,
*NL*
will
furnish
the
larva
,
when
it
is
hatched
,
with
a
tamed
and
inoffensive
*NL*
quarry
,
incapable
either
of
flight
or
of
resistance
,
but
perfectly
fresh
*NL*
for
the
larder
:
in
the
same
way
Fran√ßoise
had
adopted
,
to
minister
*NL*
to
her
permanent
and
unfaltering
resolution
to
render
the
house
*NL*
uninhabitable
to
any
other
servant
,
a
series
of
crafty
and
pitiless
*NL*
stratagems
.
Many
years
later
we
discovered
that
,
if
we
had
been
fed
on
*NL*
asparagus
day
after
day
throughout
that
whole
season
,
it
was
because
the
*NL*
smell
of
the
plants
gave
the
poor
kitchen-maid
,
who
had
to
prepare
them
,
*NL*
such
violent
attacks
of
asthma
that
she
was
finally
obliged
to
leave
my
*NL*
aunt
's
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
we
had
definitely
to
alter
our
opinion
of
M.
Legrandin
.
On
one
*NL*
of
the
Sundays
following
our
meeting
with
him
on
the
Pont-Vieux
,
after
*NL*
which
my
father
had
been
forced
to
confess
himself
mistaken
,
as
mass
*NL*
drew
to
an
end
,
and
,
with
the
sunshine
and
the
noise
of
the
outer
world
,
*NL*
something
else
invaded
the
church
,
an
atmosphere
so
far
from
sacred
that
*NL*
Mme.
Goupil
,
Mme.
Percepied
-LRB-
all
those
,
in
fact
,
who
a
moment
ago
,
when
*NL*
I
arrived
a
little
late
,
had
been
sitting
motionless
,
their
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
their
prayer-books
;
who
,
I
might
even
have
thought
,
had
not
seen
*NL*
me
come
in
,
had
not
their
feet
moved
slightly
to
push
away
the
little
*NL*
kneeling-desk
which
was
preventing
me
from
getting
to
my
chair
-RRB-
began
in
*NL*
loud
voices
to
discuss
with
us
all
manner
of
utterly
mundane
topics
,
as
*NL*
though
we
were
already
outside
in
the
Square
,
we
saw
,
standing
on
the
*NL*
sun-baked
steps
of
the
porch
,
dominating
the
many-coloured
tumult
of
the
*NL*
market
,
Legrandin
himself
,
whom
the
husband
of
the
lady
we
had
seen
with
*NL*
him
,
on
the
previous
occasion
,
was
just
going
to
introduce
to
the
wife
*NL*
of
another
large
landed
proprietor
of
the
district
.
Legrandin
's
face
*NL*
shewed
an
extraordinary
zeal
and
animation
;
he
made
a
profound
bow
,
with
*NL*
a
subsidiary
backward
movement
which
brought
his
spine
sharply
up
into
a
*NL*
position
behind
its
starting-point
,
a
gesture
in
which
he
must
have
*NL*
been
trained
by
the
husband
of
his
sister
,
Mme.
de
Cambremer
.
This
rapid
*NL*
recovery
caused
a
sort
of
tense
muscular
wave
to
ripple
over
Legrandin
's
*NL*
hips
,
which
I
had
not
supposed
to
be
so
fleshy
;
I
can
not
say
why
,
but
*NL*
this
undulation
of
pure
matter
,
this
wholly
carnal
fluency
,
with
not
the
*NL*
least
hint
in
it
of
spiritual
significance
,
this
wave
lashed
to
a
fury
*NL*
by
the
wind
of
an
assiduity
,
an
obsequiousness
of
the
basest
sort
,
awoke
*NL*
my
mind
suddenly
to
the
possibility
of
a
Legrandin
altogether
different
*NL*
from
the
one
whom
we
knew
.
The
lady
gave
him
some
message
for
her
*NL*
coachman
,
and
while
he
was
stepping
down
to
her
carriage
the
impression
*NL*
of
joy
,
timid
and
devout
,
which
the
introduction
had
stamped
there
,
*NL*
still
lingered
on
his
face
.
Carried
away
in
a
sort
of
dream
,
he
smiled
,
*NL*
then
he
began
to
hurry
back
towards
the
lady
;
he
was
walking
faster
than
*NL*
usual
,
and
his
shoulders
swayed
backwards
and
forwards
,
right
and
left
,
*NL*
in
the
most
absurd
fashion
;
altogether
he
looked
,
so
utterly
had
he
*NL*
abandoned
himself
to
it
,
ignoring
all
other
considerations
,
as
though
he
*NL*
were
the
lifeless
and
wire-pulled
puppet
of
his
own
happiness
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
we
were
coming
out
through
the
porch
;
we
were
passing
close
beside
him
;
*NL*
he
was
too
well
bred
to
turn
his
head
away
;
but
he
fixed
his
eyes
,
which
*NL*
had
suddenly
changed
to
those
of
a
seer
,
lost
in
the
profundity
of
his
*NL*
vision
,
on
so
distant
a
point
of
the
horizon
that
he
could
not
see
us
,
*NL*
and
so
had
not
to
acknowledge
our
presence
.
His
face
emerged
,
still
with
*NL*
an
air
of
innocence
,
from
his
straight
and
pliant
coat
,
which
looked
*NL*
as
though
conscious
of
having
been
led
astray
,
in
spite
of
itself
,
*NL*
and
plunged
into
surroundings
of
a
detested
splendour
.
And
a
spotted
*NL*
necktie
,
stirred
by
the
breezes
of
the
Square
,
continued
to
float
in
*NL*
front
of
Legrandin
,
like
the
standard
of
his
proud
isolation
,
of
his
*NL*
noble
independence
.
Just
as
we
reached
the
house
my
mother
discovered
*NL*
that
we
had
forgotten
the
`
Saint-Honor√©
,
'
and
asked
my
father
to
go
*NL*
back
with
me
and
tell
them
to
send
it
up
at
once
.
Near
the
church
we
met
*NL*
Legrandin
,
coming
towards
us
with
the
same
lady
,
whom
he
was
escorting
*NL*
to
her
carriage
.
He
brushed
past
us
,
and
did
not
interrupt
what
he
was
*NL*
saying
to
her
,
but
gave
us
,
out
of
the
corner
of
his
blue
eye
,
a
little
*NL*
sign
,
which
began
and
ended
,
so
to
speak
,
inside
his
eyelids
,
and
as
*NL*
it
did
not
involve
the
least
movement
of
his
facial
muscles
,
managed
to
*NL*
pass
quite
unperceived
by
the
lady
;
but
,
striving
to
compensate
by
the
*NL*
intensity
of
his
feelings
for
the
somewhat
restricted
field
in
which
*NL*
they
had
to
find
expression
,
he
made
that
blue
chink
,
which
was
set
*NL*
apart
for
us
,
sparkle
with
all
the
animation
of
cordiality
,
which
went
*NL*
far
beyond
mere
playfulness
,
and
almost
touched
the
border-line
of
*NL*
roguery
;
he
subtilised
the
refinements
of
good-fellowship
into
a
wink
*NL*
of
connivance
,
a
hint
,
a
hidden
meaning
,
a
secret
understanding
,
all
the
*NL*
mysteries
of
complicity
in
a
plot
,
and
finally
exalted
his
assurances
*NL*
of
friendship
to
the
level
of
protestations
of
affection
,
even
of
a
*NL*
declaration
of
love
,
lighting
up
for
us
,
and
for
us
alone
,
with
a
secret
*NL*
and
languid
flame
invisible
by
the
great
lady
upon
his
other
side
,
an
*NL*
enamoured
pupil
in
a
countenance
of
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
day
before
he
had
asked
my
parents
to
send
me
to
dine
with
him
*NL*
on
this
same
Sunday
evening
.
``
Come
and
bear
your
aged
friend
company
,
''
*NL*
he
had
said
to
me
.
``
Like
the
nosegay
which
a
traveller
sends
us
from
*NL*
some
land
to
which
we
shall
never
go
again
,
come
and
let
me
breathe
from
*NL*
the
far
country
of
your
adolescence
the
scent
of
those
flowers
of
*NL*
spring
among
which
I
also
used
to
wander
,
many
years
ago
.
Come
with
*NL*
the
primrose
,
with
the
canon
's
beard
,
with
the
gold-cup
;
come
with
the
*NL*
stone-crop
,
whereof
are
posies
made
,
pledges
of
love
,
in
the
Balzacian
*NL*
flora
,
come
with
that
flower
of
the
Resurrection
morning
,
the
Easter
*NL*
daisy
,
come
with
the
snowballs
of
the
guelder-rose
,
which
begin
to
*NL*
embalm
with
their
fragrance
the
alleys
of
your
great-aunt
's
garden
ere
*NL*
the
last
snows
of
Lent
are
melted
from
its
soil
.
Come
with
the
glorious
*NL*
silken
raiment
of
the
lily
,
apparel
fit
for
Solomon
,
and
with
the
*NL*
many-coloured
enamel
of
the
pansies
,
but
come
,
above
all
,
with
the
*NL*
spring
breeze
,
still
cooled
by
the
last
frosts
of
winter
,
wafting
apart
,
*NL*
for
the
two
butterflies
'
sake
,
that
have
waited
outside
all
morning
,
the
*NL*
closed
portals
of
the
first
Jerusalem
rose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
was
raised
at
home
whether
,
all
things
considered
,
I
ought
*NL*
still
to
be
sent
to
dine
with
M.
Legrandin
.
But
my
grandmother
refused
*NL*
to
believe
that
he
could
have
been
impolite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
admit
yourself
that
he
appears
at
church
there
,
quite
simply
*NL*
dressed
,
and
all
that
;
he
hardly
looks
like
a
man
of
fashion
.
''
She
added
*NL*
that
;
in
any
event
,
even
if
,
at
the
worst
,
he
had
been
intentionally
*NL*
rude
,
it
was
far
better
for
us
to
pretend
that
we
had
noticed
nothing
.
*NL*
And
indeed
my
father
himself
,
though
more
annoyed
than
any
of
us
by
the
*NL*
attitude
which
Legrandin
had
adopted
,
may
still
have
held
in
reserve
a
*NL*
final
uncertainty
as
to
its
true
meaning
.
It
was
like
every
attitude
*NL*
or
action
which
reveals
a
man
's
deep
and
hidden
character
;
they
bear
*NL*
no
relation
to
what
he
has
previously
said
,
and
we
can
not
confirm
our
*NL*
suspicions
by
the
culprit
's
evidence
,
for
he
will
admit
nothing
;
we
are
*NL*
reduced
to
the
evidence
of
our
own
senses
,
and
we
ask
ourselves
,
in
the
*NL*
face
of
this
detached
and
incoherent
fragment
of
recollection
,
whether
*NL*
indeed
our
senses
have
not
been
the
victims
of
a
hallucination
;
with
*NL*
the
result
that
such
attitudes
,
and
these
alone
are
of
importance
in
*NL*
indicating
character
,
are
the
most
apt
to
leave
us
in
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dined
with
Legrandin
on
the
terrace
of
his
house
,
by
moonlight
.
``
There
*NL*
is
a
charming
quality
,
is
there
not
,
''
he
said
to
me
,
``
in
this
silence
;
*NL*
for
hearts
that
are
wounded
,
as
mine
is
,
a
novelist
,
whom
you
will
read
*NL*
in
time
to
come
,
claims
that
there
is
no
remedy
but
silence
and
shadow
.
*NL*
And
see
you
this
,
my
boy
,
there
comes
in
all
lives
a
time
,
towards
which
*NL*
you
still
have
far
to
go
,
when
the
weary
eyes
can
endure
but
one
kind
of
*NL*
light
,
the
light
which
a
fine
evening
like
this
prepares
for
us
in
the
*NL*
stillroom
of
darkness
,
when
the
ears
can
listen
to
no
music
save
what
*NL*
the
moonlight
breathes
through
the
flute
of
silence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hear
what
M.
Legrandin
was
saying
;
like
everything
that
he
said
,
*NL*
it
sounded
attractive
;
but
I
was
disturbed
by
the
memory
of
a
lady
whom
*NL*
I
had
seen
recently
for
the
first
time
;
and
thinking
,
now
that
I
*NL*
knew
that
Legrandin
was
on
friendly
terms
with
several
of
the
local
*NL*
aristocracy
,
that
perhaps
she
also
was
among
his
acquaintance
,
I
*NL*
summoned
up
all
my
courage
and
said
to
him
:
``
Tell
me
,
sir
,
do
you
,
by
*NL*
any
chance
,
know
the
lady
--
the
ladies
of
Guermantes
?
''
and
I
felt
glad
*NL*
because
,
in
pronouncing
the
name
,
I
had
secured
a
sort
of
power
over
*NL*
it
,
by
the
mere
act
of
drawing
it
up
out
of
my
dreams
and
giving
it
an
*NL*
objective
existence
in
the
world
of
spoken
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
at
the
sound
of
the
word
Guermantes
,
I
saw
in
the
middle
of
each
of
*NL*
our
friend
's
blue
eyes
a
little
brown
dimple
appear
,
as
though
they
had
*NL*
been
stabbed
by
some
invisible
pin-point
,
while
the
rest
of
his
pupils
,
*NL*
reacting
from
the
shock
,
received
and
secreted
the
azure
overflow
.
*NL*
His
fringed
eyelids
darkened
,
and
drooped
.
His
mouth
,
which
had
been
*NL*
stiffened
and
seared
with
bitter
lines
,
was
the
first
to
recover
,
and
*NL*
smiled
,
while
his
eyes
still
seemed
full
of
pain
,
like
the
eyes
of
a
*NL*
good-looking
martyr
whose
body
bristles
with
arrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
know
them
,
''
he
said
,
but
instead
of
uttering
so
simple
a
*NL*
piece
of
information
,
a
reply
in
which
there
was
so
little
that
could
*NL*
astonish
me
,
in
the
natural
and
conversational
tone
which
would
have
*NL*
befitted
it
,
he
recited
it
with
a
separate
stress
upon
each
word
,
*NL*
leaning
forward
,
bowing
his
head
,
with
at
once
the
vehemence
which
a
man
*NL*
gives
,
so
as
to
be
believed
,
to
a
highly
improbable
statement
-LRB-
as
though
*NL*
the
fact
that
he
did
not
know
the
Guermantes
could
be
due
only
to
some
*NL*
strange
accident
of
fortune
-RRB-
and
with
the
emphasis
of
a
man
who
,
finding
*NL*
himself
unable
to
keep
silence
about
what
is
to
him
a
painful
situation
,
*NL*
chooses
to
proclaim
it
aloud
,
so
as
to
convince
his
hearers
that
the
*NL*
confession
he
is
making
is
one
that
causes
him
no
embarrassment
,
but
is
*NL*
easy
,
agreeable
,
spontaneous
,
that
the
situation
in
question
,
in
this
*NL*
case
the
absence
of
relations
with
the
Guermantes
family
,
might
very
*NL*
well
have
been
not
forced
upon
,
but
actually
designed
by
Legrandin
*NL*
himself
,
might
arise
from
some
family
tradition
,
some
moral
principle
or
*NL*
mystical
vow
which
expressly
forbade
his
seeking
their
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
resumed
,
explaining
by
his
words
the
tone
in
which
they
were
*NL*
uttered
.
``
No
,
I
do
not
know
them
;
I
have
never
wished
to
know
them
;
I
*NL*
have
always
made
a
point
of
preserving
complete
independence
;
at
heart
,
*NL*
as
you
know
,
I
am
a
bit
of
a
Radical
.
People
are
always
coming
to
me
*NL*
about
it
,
telling
me
I
am
mistaken
in
not
going
to
Guermantes
,
that
I
*NL*
make
myself
seem
ill-bred
,
uncivilised
,
an
old
bear
.
But
that
's
not
the
*NL*
sort
of
reputation
that
can
frighten
me
;
it
's
too
true
!
In
my
heart
*NL*
of
hearts
I
care
for
nothing
in
the
world
now
but
a
few
churches
,
*NL*
books
--
two
or
three
,
pictures
--
rather
more
,
perhaps
,
and
the
light
of
*NL*
the
moon
when
the
fresh
breeze
of
youth
-LRB-
such
as
yours
-RRB-
wafts
to
my
*NL*
nostrils
the
scent
of
gardens
whose
flowers
my
old
eyes
are
not
sharp
*NL*
enough
,
now
,
to
distinguish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
understand
very
clearly
why
,
in
order
to
refrain
from
going
*NL*
to
the
houses
of
people
whom
one
did
not
know
,
it
should
be
necessary
to
*NL*
cling
to
one
's
independence
,
nor
how
that
could
give
one
the
appearance
*NL*
of
a
savage
or
a
bear
.
But
what
I
did
understand
was
this
,
that
*NL*
Legrandin
was
not
altogether
truthful
when
he
said
that
he
cared
only
*NL*
for
churches
,
moonlight
,
and
youth
;
he
cared
also
,
he
cared
a
very
*NL*
great
deal
,
for
people
who
lived
in
country
houses
,
and
would
be
so
much
*NL*
afraid
,
when
in
their
company
,
of
incurring
their
displeasure
that
he
*NL*
would
never
dare
to
let
them
see
that
he
numbered
,
as
well
,
among
*NL*
his
friends
middle-class
people
,
the
families
of
solicitors
and
*NL*
stockbrokers
,
preferring
,
if
the
truth
must
be
known
,
that
it
should
*NL*
be
revealed
in
his
absence
,
when
he
was
out
of
earshot
,
that
judgment
*NL*
should
go
against
him
-LRB-
if
so
it
must
-RRB-
by
default
:
in
a
word
,
he
was
a
*NL*
snob
.
Of
course
he
would
never
have
admitted
all
or
any
of
this
in
the
*NL*
poetical
language
which
my
family
and
I
so
much
admired
.
And
if
I
asked
*NL*
him
,
``
Do
you
know
the
Guermantes
family
?
''
Legrandin
the
talker
would
*NL*
reply
,
``
No
,
I
have
never
cared
to
know
them
.
''
But
unfortunately
the
*NL*
talker
was
now
subordinated
to
another
Legrandin
,
whom
he
kept
carefully
*NL*
hidden
in
his
breast
,
whom
he
would
never
consciously
exhibit
,
because
*NL*
this
other
could
tell
stories
about
our
own
Legrandin
and
about
his
*NL*
snobbishness
which
would
have
ruined
his
reputation
for
ever
;
and
this
*NL*
other
Legrandin
had
replied
to
me
already
in
that
wounded
look
,
that
*NL*
stiffened
smile
,
the
undue
gravity
of
his
tone
in
uttering
those
*NL*
few
words
,
in
the
thousand
arrows
by
which
our
own
Legrandin
had
*NL*
instantaneously
been
stabbed
and
sickened
,
like
a
Saint
Sebastian
of
*NL*
snobbery
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
you
hurt
me
!
No
,
I
do
not
know
the
Guermantes
family
.
Do
not
*NL*
remind
me
of
the
great
sorrow
of
my
life
.
''
And
since
this
other
,
*NL*
this
irrepressible
,
dominant
,
despotic
Legrandin
,
if
he
lacked
our
*NL*
Legrandin
's
charming
vocabulary
,
shewed
an
infinitely
greater
promptness
*NL*
in
expressing
himself
,
by
means
of
what
are
called
`
reflexes
,
'
it
*NL*
followed
that
,
when
Legrandin
the
talker
attempted
to
silence
him
,
he
*NL*
would
already
have
spoken
,
and
it
would
be
useless
for
our
friend
to
*NL*
deplore
the
bad
impression
which
the
revelations
of
his
_
alter
ego
_
must
*NL*
have
caused
,
since
he
could
do
no
more
now
than
endeavour
to
mitigate
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
to
say
that
M.
Legrandin
was
anything
but
sincere
when
he
*NL*
inveighed
against
snobs
.
He
could
not
-LRB-
from
his
own
knowledge
,
at
least
-RRB-
*NL*
be
aware
that
he
was
one
also
,
since
it
is
only
with
the
passions
of
*NL*
others
that
we
are
ever
really
familiar
,
and
what
we
come
to
find
out
*NL*
about
our
own
can
be
no
more
than
what
other
people
have
shewn
us
.
Upon
*NL*
ourselves
they
react
but
indirectly
,
through
our
imagination
,
which
*NL*
substitutes
for
our
actual
,
primary
motives
other
,
secondary
motives
,
*NL*
less
stark
and
therefore
more
decent
.
Never
had
Legrandin
's
snobbishness
*NL*
impelled
him
to
make
a
habit
of
visiting
a
duchess
as
such
.
Instead
,
it
*NL*
would
set
his
imagination
to
make
that
duchess
appear
,
in
Legrandin
's
*NL*
eyes
,
endowed
with
all
the
graces
.
He
would
be
drawn
towards
the
*NL*
duchess
,
assuring
himself
the
while
that
he
was
yielding
to
the
*NL*
attractions
of
her
mind
,
and
her
other
virtues
,
which
the
vile
race
of
*NL*
snobs
could
never
understand
.
Only
his
fellow-snobs
knew
that
he
was
*NL*
of
their
number
,
for
,
owing
to
their
inability
to
appreciate
the
*NL*
intervening
efforts
of
his
imagination
,
they
saw
in
close
juxtaposition
*NL*
the
social
activities
of
Legrandin
and
their
primary
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
home
,
meanwhile
,
we
had
no
longer
any
illusions
as
to
M.
Legrandin
,
*NL*
and
our
relations
with
him
had
become
much
more
distant
.
Mamma
would
be
*NL*
greatly
delighted
whenever
she
caught
him
red-handed
in
the
sin
,
which
*NL*
he
continued
to
call
the
unpardonable
sin
,
of
snobbery
.
As
for
my
*NL*
father
,
he
found
it
difficult
to
take
Legrandin
's
airs
in
so
light
,
in
*NL*
so
detached
a
spirit
;
and
when
there
was
some
talk
,
one
year
,
of
sending
*NL*
me
to
spend
the
long
summer
holidays
at
Balbec
with
my
grandmother
,
*NL*
he
said
:
``
I
must
,
most
certainly
,
tell
Legrandin
that
you
are
going
to
*NL*
Balbec
,
to
see
whether
he
will
offer
you
an
introduction
to
his
sister
.
*NL*
He
probably
does
n't
remember
telling
us
that
she
lived
within
a
mile
of
*NL*
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
,
who
held
that
,
when
one
went
to
the
seaside
,
one
ought
*NL*
to
be
on
the
beach
from
morning
to
night
,
to
taste
the
salt
breezes
,
and
*NL*
that
one
should
not
know
anyone
in
the
place
,
because
calls
and
parties
*NL*
and
excursions
were
so
much
time
stolen
from
what
belonged
,
by
rights
,
*NL*
to
the
sea-air
,
begged
him
on
no
account
to
speak
to
Legrandin
of
our
*NL*
plans
;
for
already
,
in
her
mind
's
eye
,
she
could
see
his
sister
,
Mme.
de
*NL*
Cambremer
,
alighting
from
her
carriage
at
the
door
of
our
hotel
just
*NL*
as
we
were
on
the
point
of
going
out
fishing
,
and
obliging
us
to
remain
*NL*
indoors
all
afternoon
to
entertain
her
.
But
Mamma
laughed
her
fears
to
*NL*
scorn
,
for
she
herself
felt
that
the
danger
was
not
so
threatening
,
and
*NL*
that
Legrandin
would
shew
no
undue
anxiety
to
make
us
acquainted
with
*NL*
his
sister
.
And
,
as
it
happened
,
there
was
no
need
for
any
of
us
to
*NL*
introduce
the
subject
of
Balbec
,
for
it
was
Legrandin
himself
who
,
*NL*
without
the
least
suspicion
that
we
had
ever
had
any
intention
of
*NL*
visiting
those
parts
,
walked
into
the
trap
uninvited
one
evening
,
when
*NL*
we
met
him
strolling
on
the
banks
of
the
Vivonne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
tints
in
the
clouds
this
evening
,
violets
and
blues
,
which
*NL*
are
very
beautiful
,
are
they
not
,
my
friend
?
''
he
said
to
my
father
.
*NL*
``
Especially
a
blue
which
is
far
more
floral
than
atmospheric
,
a
*NL*
cineraria
blue
,
which
it
is
surprising
to
see
in
the
sky
.
And
that
*NL*
little
pink
cloud
there
,
has
it
not
just
the
tint
of
some
flower
,
a
*NL*
carnation
or
hydrangea
?
Nowhere
,
perhaps
,
except
on
the
shores
of
the
*NL*
English
Channel
,
where
Normandy
merges
into
Brittany
,
have
I
been
able
*NL*
to
find
such
copious
examples
of
what
you
might
call
a
vegetable
kingdom
*NL*
in
the
clouds
.
Down
there
,
close
to
Balbec
,
among
all
those
places
which
*NL*
are
still
so
uncivilised
,
there
is
a
little
bay
,
charmingly
quiet
,
where
*NL*
the
sunsets
of
the
Auge
Valley
,
those
red-and-gold
sunsets
-LRB-
which
,
*NL*
all
the
same
,
I
am
very
far
from
despising
-RRB-
seem
commonplace
and
*NL*
insignificant
;
for
in
that
moist
and
gentle
atmosphere
these
heavenly
*NL*
flower-beds
will
break
into
blossom
,
in
a
few
moments
,
in
the
evenings
,
*NL*
incomparably
lovely
,
and
often
lasting
for
hours
before
they
fade
.
*NL*
Others
shed
their
leaves
at
once
,
and
then
it
is
more
beautiful
still
*NL*
to
see
the
sky
strewn
with
the
scattering
of
their
innumerable
petals
,
*NL*
sulphurous
yellow
and
rosy
red
.
In
that
bay
,
which
they
call
the
Opal
*NL*
Bay
,
the
golden
sands
appear
more
charming
still
from
being
fastened
,
*NL*
like
fair
Andromeda
,
to
those
terrible
rocks
of
the
surrounding
coast
,
*NL*
to
that
funereal
shore
,
famed
for
the
number
of
its
wrecks
,
where
every
*NL*
winter
many
a
brave
vessel
falls
a
victim
to
the
perils
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
Balbec
!
the
oldest
bone
in
the
geological
skeleton
that
underlies
our
*NL*
soil
,
the
true
Armor
,
the
sea
,
the
land
's
end
,
the
accursed
region
*NL*
which
Anatole
France
--
an
enchanter
whose
works
our
young
friend
ought
to
*NL*
read
--
has
so
well
depicted
,
beneath
its
eternal
fogs
,
as
though
it
were
*NL*
indeed
the
land
of
the
Cimmerians
in
the
Odyssey
.
Balbec
;
yes
,
they
*NL*
are
building
hotels
there
now
,
superimposing
them
upon
its
ancient
and
*NL*
charming
soil
,
which
they
are
powerless
to
alter
;
how
delightful
it
is
,
*NL*
down
there
,
to
be
able
to
step
out
at
once
into
regions
so
primitive
and
*NL*
so
entrancing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
And
do
you
know
anyone
at
Balbec
?
''
inquired
my
father
.
``
This
*NL*
young
man
is
just
going
to
spend
a
couple
of
months
there
with
his
*NL*
grandmother
,
and
my
wife
too
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Legrandin
,
taken
unawares
by
the
question
at
a
moment
when
he
was
*NL*
looking
directly
at
my
father
,
was
unable
to
turn
aside
his
gaze
,
and
so
*NL*
concentrated
it
with
steadily
increasing
intensity
--
smiling
mournfully
*NL*
the
while
--
upon
the
eyes
of
his
questioner
,
with
an
air
of
friendliness
*NL*
and
frankness
and
of
not
being
afraid
to
look
him
in
the
face
,
until
he
*NL*
seemed
to
have
penetrated
my
father
's
skull
,
as
it
had
been
a
ball
of
*NL*
glass
,
and
to
be
seeing
,
at
the
moment
,
a
long
way
beyond
and
behind
it
,
*NL*
a
brightly
coloured
cloud
,
which
provided
him
with
a
mental
alibi
,
and
*NL*
would
enable
him
to
establish
the
theory
that
,
just
when
he
was
*NL*
being
asked
whether
he
knew
anyone
at
Balbec
,
he
had
been
thinking
*NL*
of
something
else
,
and
so
had
not
heard
the
question
.
As
a
rule
these
*NL*
tactics
make
the
questioner
proceed
to
ask
,
``
Why
,
what
are
you
thinking
*NL*
about
?
''
But
my
father
,
inquisitive
,
annoyed
,
and
cruel
,
repeated
:
``
Have
*NL*
you
friends
,
then
,
in
that
neighbourhood
,
that
you
know
Balbec
so
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
final
and
desperate
effort
the
smiling
gaze
of
Legrandin
struggled
*NL*
to
the
extreme
limits
of
its
tenderness
,
vagueness
,
candour
,
and
*NL*
distraction
;
then
feeling
,
no
doubt
,
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
it
*NL*
now
but
to
answer
,
he
said
to
us
:
``
I
have
friends
all
the
world
over
,
*NL*
wherever
there
are
companies
of
trees
,
stricken
but
not
defeated
,
*NL*
which
have
come
together
to
offer
a
common
supplication
,
with
pathetic
*NL*
obstinacy
,
to
an
inclement
sky
which
has
no
mercy
upon
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
quite
what
I
meant
,
''
interrupted
my
father
,
obstinate
as
*NL*
a
tree
and
merciless
as
the
sky
.
``
I
asked
you
,
in
case
anything
should
*NL*
happen
to
my
mother-in-law
and
she
wanted
to
feel
that
she
was
not
all
*NL*
alone
down
there
,
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
whether
you
knew
any
of
the
*NL*
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
as
elsewhere
,
I
know
everyone
and
I
know
no
one
,
''
replied
*NL*
Legrandin
,
who
was
by
no
means
ready
yet
to
surrender
;
``
places
I
know
*NL*
well
,
people
very
slightly
.
But
,
down
there
,
the
places
themselves
seem
*NL*
to
me
just
like
people
,
rare
and
wonderful
people
,
of
a
delicate
quality
*NL*
which
would
have
been
corrupted
and
ruined
by
the
gift
of
life
.
Perhaps
*NL*
it
is
a
castle
which
you
encounter
upon
the
cliff
's
edge
;
standing
there
*NL*
by
the
roadside
,
where
it
has
halted
to
contemplate
its
sorrows
before
*NL*
an
evening
sky
,
still
rosy
,
through
which
a
golden
moon
is
climbing
;
*NL*
while
the
fishing-boats
,
homeward
bound
,
creasing
the
watered
silk
of
*NL*
the
Channel
,
hoist
its
pennant
at
their
mastheads
and
carry
its
colours
.
*NL*
Or
perhaps
it
is
a
simple
dwelling-house
that
stands
alone
,
ugly
,
if
*NL*
anything
,
timid-seeming
but
full
of
romance
,
hiding
from
every
eye
some
*NL*
imperishable
secret
of
happiness
and
disenchantment
.
That
land
which
*NL*
knows
not
truth
,
''
he
continued
with
Machiavellian
subtlety
,
``
that
land
*NL*
of
infinite
fiction
makes
bad
reading
for
any
boy
;
and
is
certainly
*NL*
not
what
I
should
choose
or
recommend
for
my
young
friend
here
,
who
is
*NL*
already
so
much
inclined
to
melancholy
,
for
a
heart
already
predisposed
*NL*
to
receive
its
impressions
.
Climates
that
breathe
amorous
secrets
and
*NL*
futile
regrets
may
agree
with
an
old
and
disillusioned
man
like
myself
;
*NL*
but
they
must
always
prove
fatal
to
a
temperament
which
is
still
*NL*
unformed

Believe
me
,
''
he
went
on
with
emphasis
,
``
the
waters
of
that
*NL*
bay
--
more
Breton
than
Norman
--
may
exert
a
sedative
influence
,
though
*NL*
even
that
is
of
questionable
value
,
upon
a
heart
which
,
like
mine
,
is
no
*NL*
longer
unbroken
,
a
heart
for
whose
wounds
there
is
no
longer
anything
*NL*
to
compensate
.
But
at
your
age
,
my
boy
,
those
waters
are
*NL*
contra-indicated
...
Good
night
to
you
,
neighbours
,
''
he
added
,
moving
*NL*
away
from
us
with
that
evasive
abruptness
to
which
we
were
accustomed
;
*NL*
and
then
,
turning
towards
us
,
with
a
physicianly
finger
raised
in
*NL*
warning
,
he
resumed
the
consultation
:
``
No
Balbec
before
you
are
fifty
!
''
*NL*
he
called
out
to
me
,
``
and
even
then
it
must
depend
on
the
state
of
the
*NL*
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
spoke
to
him
of
it
again
,
as
often
as
we
met
him
,
and
tortured
*NL*
him
with
questions
,
but
it
was
labour
in
vain
:
like
that
scholarly
*NL*
swindler
who
devoted
to
the
fabrication
of
forged
palimpsests
a
wealth
*NL*
of
skill
and
knowledge
and
industry
the
hundredth
part
of
which
would
*NL*
have
sufficed
to
establish
him
in
a
more
lucrative
--
but
an
honourable
*NL*
occupation
,
M.
Legrandin
,
had
we
insisted
further
,
would
in
the
end
have
*NL*
constructed
a
whole
system
of
ethics
,
and
a
celestial
geography
of
Lower
*NL*
Normandy
,
sooner
than
admit
to
us
that
,
within
a
mile
of
Balbec
,
his
own
*NL*
sister
was
living
in
her
own
house
;
sooner
than
find
himself
obliged
*NL*
to
offer
us
a
letter
of
introduction
,
the
prospect
of
which
would
never
*NL*
have
inspired
him
with
such
terror
had
he
been
absolutely
certain
--
as
,
*NL*
from
his
knowledge
of
my
grandmother
's
character
,
he
really
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
certain
--
that
in
no
circumstances
whatsoever
would
we
have
*NL*
dreamed
of
making
use
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
We
used
always
to
return
from
our
walks
in
good
time
to
pay
aunt
L√©onie
*NL*
a
visit
before
dinner
.
In
the
first
weeks
of
our
Combray
holidays
,
when
*NL*
the
days
ended
early
,
we
would
still
be
able
to
see
,
as
we
turned
*NL*
into
the
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
,
a
reflection
of
the
western
sky
from
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
house
and
a
band
of
purple
at
the
foot
of
the
Calvary
,
*NL*
which
was
mirrored
further
on
in
the
pond
;
a
fiery
glow
which
,
*NL*
accompanied
often
by
a
cold
that
burned
and
stung
,
would
associate
*NL*
itself
in
my
mind
with
the
glow
of
the
fire
over
which
,
at
that
very
*NL*
moment
,
was
roasting
the
chicken
that
was
to
furnish
me
,
in
place
of
the
*NL*
poetic
pleasure
I
had
found
in
my
walk
,
with
the
sensual
pleasures
of
*NL*
good
feeding
,
warmth
and
rest
.
But
in
summer
,
when
we
came
back
to
the
*NL*
house
,
the
sun
would
not
have
set
;
and
while
we
were
upstairs
paying
our
*NL*
visit
to
aunt
L√©onie
its
rays
,
sinking
until
they
touched
and
lay
along
*NL*
her
window-sill
,
would
there
be
caught
and
held
by
the
large
inner
*NL*
curtains
and
the
bands
which
tied
them
back
to
the
wall
,
and
split
and
*NL*
scattered
and
filtered
;
and
then
,
at
last
,
would
fall
upon
and
inlay
*NL*
with
tiny
flakes
of
gold
the
lemonwood
of
her
chest-of-drawers
,
*NL*
illuminating
the
room
in
their
passage
with
the
same
delicate
,
slanting
,
*NL*
shadowed
beams
that
fall
among
the
boles
of
forest
trees
.
But
on
some
*NL*
days
,
though
very
rarely
,
the
chest-of-drawers
would
long
since
have
*NL*
shed
its
momentary
adornments
,
there
would
no
longer
,
as
we
turned
into
*NL*
the
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
,
be
any
reflection
from
the
western
sky
burning
*NL*
along
the
line
of
window-panes
;
the
pond
beneath
the
Calvary
would
*NL*
have
lost
its
fiery
glow
,
sometimes
indeed
had
changed
already
to
an
*NL*
opalescent
pallor
,
while
a
long
ribbon
of
moonlight
,
bent
and
broken
*NL*
and
broadened
by
every
ripple
upon
the
water
's
surface
,
would
be
lying
*NL*
across
it
,
from
end
to
end
.
Then
,
as
we
drew
near
the
house
,
we
would
*NL*
make
out
a
figure
standing
upon
the
doorstep
,
and
Mamma
would
say
to
me
:
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
There
is
Fran√ßoise
looking
out
for
us
;
your
aunt
must
be
*NL*
anxious
;
that
means
we
are
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
wasting
time
by
stopping
to
take
off
our
`
things
'
we
would
*NL*
fly
upstairs
to
my
aunt
L√©onie
's
room
to
reassure
her
,
to
prove
to
her
*NL*
by
our
bodily
presence
that
all
her
gloomy
imaginings
were
false
,
that
,
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
nothing
had
happened
to
us
,
but
that
we
had
gone
the
*NL*
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
and
,
good
lord
,
when
one
took
that
walk
,
my
aunt
knew
*NL*
well
enough
that
one
could
never
say
at
what
time
one
would
be
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
Fran√ßoise
,
''
my
aunt
would
say
,
``
did
n't
I
tell
you
that
they
must
*NL*
have
gone
the
Guermantes
way
?
Good
gracious
!
They
must
be
hungry
!
And
*NL*
your
nice
leg
of
mutton
will
be
quite
dried
up
now
,
after
all
the
hours
*NL*
it
's
been
waiting
.
What
a
time
to
come
in
!
Well
,
and
so
you
went
the
*NL*
Guermantes
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Leonie
,
I
supposed
you
knew
,
''
Mamma
would
answer
.
``
I
thought
*NL*
that
Fran√ßoise
had
seen
us
go
out
by
the
little
gate
,
through
the
*NL*
kitchen-garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
there
were
,
in
the
environs
of
Combray
,
two
`
ways
'
which
we
used
to
*NL*
take
for
our
walks
,
and
so
diametrically
opposed
that
we
would
actually
*NL*
leave
the
house
by
a
different
door
,
according
to
the
way
we
had
chosen
:
*NL*
the
way
towards
M√©s√©glise-la-Vineuse
,
which
we
called
also
`
Swann
's
*NL*
way
,
'
because
,
to
get
there
,
one
had
to
pass
along
the
boundary
of
M.
*NL*
Swann
's
estate
,
and
the
`
Guermantes
way
.
'
Of
M√©s√©glise-la-Vineuse
,
to
*NL*
tell
the
truth
,
I
never
knew
anything
more
than
the
way
there
,
and
*NL*
the
strange
people
who
would
come
over
on
Sundays
to
take
the
air
in
*NL*
Combray
,
people
whom
,
this
time
,
neither
my
aunt
nor
any
of
us
would
*NL*
`
know
at
all
,
'
and
whom
we
would
therefore
assume
to
be
`
people
who
must
*NL*
have
come
over
from
M√©s√©glise
.
'
As
for
Guermantes
,
I
was
to
know
it
well
*NL*
enough
one
day
,
but
that
day
had
still
to
come
;
and
,
during
the
whole
*NL*
of
my
boyhood
,
if
M√©s√©glise
was
to
me
something
as
inaccessible
as
the
*NL*
horizon
,
which
remained
hidden
from
sight
,
however
far
one
went
,
by
the
*NL*
folds
of
a
country
which
no
longer
bore
the
least
resemblance
to
the
*NL*
country
round
Combray
;
Guermantes
,
on
the
other
hand
,
meant
no
more
than
*NL*
the
ultimate
goal
,
ideal
rather
than
real
,
of
the
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
a
*NL*
sort
of
abstract
geographical
term
like
the
North
Pole
or
the
Equator
.
*NL*
And
so
to
`
take
the
Guermantes
way
'
in
order
to
get
to
M√©s√©glise
,
or
*NL*
vice
versa
,
would
have
seemed
to
me
as
nonsensical
a
proceeding
as
to
*NL*
turn
to
the
east
in
order
to
reach
the
west
.
Since
my
father
used
always
*NL*
to
speak
of
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
'
as
comprising
the
finest
view
of
a
plain
*NL*
that
he
knew
anywhere
,
and
of
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
as
typical
of
river
*NL*
scenery
,
I
had
invested
each
of
them
,
by
conceiving
them
in
this
way
as
*NL*
two
distinct
entities
,
with
that
cohesion
,
that
unity
which
belongs
*NL*
only
to
the
figments
of
the
mind
;
the
smallest
detail
of
either
of
*NL*
them
appeared
to
me
as
a
precious
thing
,
which
exhibited
the
special
*NL*
excellence
of
the
whole
,
while
,
immediately
beside
them
,
in
the
first
*NL*
stages
of
our
walk
,
before
we
had
reached
the
sacred
soil
of
one
or
the
*NL*
other
,
the
purely
material
roads
,
at
definite
points
on
which
they
*NL*
were
set
down
as
the
ideal
view
over
a
plain
and
the
ideal
scenery
of
a
*NL*
river
,
were
no
more
worth
the
trouble
of
looking
at
them
than
,
to
a
keen
*NL*
playgoer
and
lover
of
dramatic
art
,
are
the
little
streets
which
may
*NL*
happen
to
run
past
the
walls
of
a
theatre
.
But
,
above
all
,
I
set
between
*NL*
them
,
far
more
distinctly
than
the
mere
distance
in
miles
and
yards
and
*NL*
inches
which
separated
one
from
the
other
,
the
distance
that
there
was
*NL*
between
the
two
parts
of
my
brain
in
which
I
used
to
think
of
them
,
one
*NL*
of
those
distances
of
the
mind
which
time
serves
only
to
lengthen
,
which
*NL*
separate
things
irremediably
from
one
another
,
keeping
them
for
ever
*NL*
upon
different
planes
.
And
this
distinction
was
rendered
still
more
*NL*
absolute
because
the
habit
we
had
of
never
going
both
ways
on
the
same
*NL*
day
,
or
in
the
course
of
the
same
walk
,
but
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
'
one
time
*NL*
and
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
another
,
shut
them
up
,
so
to
speak
,
far
apart
*NL*
and
unaware
of
each
other
's
existence
,
in
the
sealed
vessels
--
between
*NL*
which
there
could
be
no
communication
--
of
separate
afternoons
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
decided
to
go
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
'
we
would
start
-LRB-
without
*NL*
undue
haste
,
and
even
if
the
sky
were
clouded
over
,
since
the
walk
was
*NL*
not
very
long
,
and
did
not
take
us
too
far
from
home
-RRB-
,
as
though
we
were
*NL*
not
going
anywhere
in
particular
,
by
the
front-door
of
my
aunt
's
house
,
*NL*
which
opened
on
to
the
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
.
We
would
be
greeted
by
*NL*
the
gunsmith
,
we
would
drop
our
letters
into
the
box
,
we
would
tell
*NL*
Th√©odore
,
from
Fran√ßoise
,
as
we
passed
,
that
she
had
run
out
of
oil
*NL*
or
coffee
,
and
we
would
leave
the
town
by
the
road
which
ran
along
the
*NL*
white
fence
of
M.
Swann
's
park
.
Before
reaching
it
we
would
be
met
on
*NL*
our
way
by
the
scent
of
his
lilac-trees
,
come
out
to
welcome
strangers
.
*NL*
Out
of
the
fresh
little
green
hearts
of
their
foliage
the
lilacs
raised
*NL*
inquisitively
over
the
fence
of
the
park
their
plumes
of
white
or
purple
*NL*
blossom
,
which
glowed
,
even
in
the
shade
,
with
the
sunlight
in
which
*NL*
they
had
been
bathed
.
Some
of
them
,
half-concealed
by
the
little
*NL*
tiled
house
,
called
the
Archers
'
Lodge
,
in
which
Swann
's
keeper
lived
,
*NL*
overtopped
its
gothic
gable
with
their
rosy
minaret
.
The
nymphs
of
*NL*
spring
would
have
seemed
coarse
and
vulgar
in
comparison
with
these
*NL*
young
houris
,
who
retained
,
in
this
French
garden
,
the
pure
and
vivid
*NL*
colouring
of
a
Persian
miniature
.
Despite
my
desire
to
throw
my
arms
*NL*
about
their
pliant
forms
and
to
draw
down
towards
me
the
starry
locks
*NL*
that
crowned
their
fragrant
heads
,
we
would
pass
them
by
without
*NL*
stopping
,
for
my
parents
had
ceased
to
visit
Tansonville
since
Swann
's
*NL*
marriage
,
and
,
so
as
not
to
appear
to
be
looking
into
his
park
,
we
*NL*
would
,
instead
of
taking
the
road
which
ran
beside
its
boundary
and
then
*NL*
climbed
straight
up
to
the
open
fields
,
choose
another
way
,
which
led
in
*NL*
the
same
direction
,
but
circuitously
,
and
brought
us
out
rather
too
far
*NL*
from
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
my
grandfather
said
to
my
`
father
:
``
Do
n't
you
remember
Swann
's
*NL*
telling
us
yesterday
that
his
wife
and
daughter
had
gone
off
to
Rheims
*NL*
and
that
he
was
taking
the
opportunity
of
spending
a
day
or
two
in
*NL*
Paris
?
We
might
go
along
by
the
park
,
since
the
ladies
are
not
at
home
;
*NL*
that
will
make
it
a
little
shorter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
stopped
for
a
moment
by
the
fence
.
Lilac-time
was
nearly
over
;
some
*NL*
of
the
trees
still
thrust
aloft
,
in
tall
purple
chandeliers
,
their
tiny
*NL*
balls
of
blossom
,
but
in
many
places
among
their
foliage
where
,
only
*NL*
a
week
before
,
they
had
still
been
breaking
in
waves
of
fragrant
foam
,
*NL*
these
were
now
spent
and
shrivelled
and
discoloured
,
a
hollow
scum
,
dry
*NL*
and
scentless
.
My
grandfather
pointed
out
to
my
father
in
what
respects
*NL*
the
appearance
of
the
place
was
still
the
same
,
and
how
far
it
had
*NL*
altered
since
the
walk
that
he
had
taken
with
old
M.
Swann
,
on
the
day
*NL*
of
his
wife
's
death
;
and
he
seized
the
opportunity
to
tell
us
,
once
*NL*
again
,
the
story
of
that
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
front
of
us
a
path
bordered
with
nasturtiums
rose
in
the
full
glare
*NL*
of
the
sun
towards
the
house
.
But
to
our
right
the
park
stretched
away
*NL*
into
the
distance
,
on
level
ground
.
Overshadowed
by
the
tall
trees
which
*NL*
stood
close
around
it
,
an
`
ornamental
water
'
had
been
constructed
by
*NL*
Swann
's
parents
but
,
even
in
his
most
artificial
creations
,
nature
is
*NL*
the
material
upon
which
man
has
to
work
;
certain
spots
will
persist
in
*NL*
remaining
surrounded
by
the
vassals
of
their
own
especial
sovereignty
,
*NL*
and
will
raise
their
immemorial
standards
among
all
the
`
laid-out
'
*NL*
scenery
of
a
park
,
just
as
they
would
have
done
far
from
any
human
*NL*
interference
,
in
a
solitude
which
must
everywhere
return
to
engulf
*NL*
them
,
springing
up
out
of
the
necessities
of
their
exposed
position
,
and
*NL*
superimposing
itself
upon
the
work
of
man
's
hands
.
And
so
it
was
that
,
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
path
which
led
down
to
this
artificial
lake
,
there
*NL*
might
be
seen
,
in
its
two
tiers
woven
of
trailing
forget-me-nots
below
*NL*
and
of
periwinkle
flowers
above
,
the
natural
,
delicate
,
blue
garland
*NL*
which
binds
the
luminous
,
shadowed
brows
of
water-nymphs
;
while
the
*NL*
iris
,
its
swords
sweeping
every
way
in
regal
profusion
,
stretched
out
*NL*
over
agrimony
and
water-growing
king-cups
the
lilied
sceptres
,
tattered
*NL*
glories
of
yellow
and
purple
,
of
the
kingdom
of
the
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
absence
of
Mlle.
Swann
,
which
--
since
it
preserved
me
from
the
*NL*
terrible
risk
of
seeing
her
appear
on
one
of
the
paths
,
and
of
being
*NL*
identified
and
scorned
by
this
so
privileged
little
girl
who
had
*NL*
Bergotte
for
a
friend
and
used
to
go
with
him
to
visit
cathedrals
--
made
*NL*
the
exploration
of
Tansonville
,
now
for
the
first
time
permitted
me
,
a
*NL*
matter
of
indifference
to
myself
,
seemed
however
to
invest
the
property
,
*NL*
in
my
grandfather
's
and
father
's
eyes
,
with
a
fresh
and
transient
charm
,
*NL*
and
-LRB-
like
an
entirely
cloudless
sky
when
one
is
going
mountaineering
-RRB-
to
*NL*
make
the
day
extraordinarily
propitious
for
a
walk
in
this
direction
;
*NL*
I
should
have
liked
to
see
their
reckoning
proved
false
,
to
see
,
by
a
*NL*
miracle
,
Mlle.
Swann
appear
,
with
her
father
,
so
close
to
us
that
we
*NL*
should
not
have
time
to
escape
,
and
should
therefore
be
obliged
to
make
*NL*
her
acquaintance
.
And
so
,
when
I
suddenly
noticed
a
straw
basket
lying
*NL*
forgotten
on
the
grass
by
the
side
of
a
line
whose
float
was
bobbing
*NL*
in
the
water
,
I
made
a
great
effort
to
keep
my
father
and
grandfather
*NL*
looking
in
another
direction
,
away
from
this
sign
that
she
might
,
after
*NL*
all
,
be
in
residence
.
Still
,
as
Swann
had
told
us
that
he
ought
not
,
*NL*
really
,
to
go
away
just
then
,
as
he
had
some
people
staying
in
the
*NL*
house
,
the
line
might
equally
belong
to
one
of
these
guests
.
Not
a
*NL*
footstep
was
to
be
heard
on
any
of
the
paths
.
Somewhere
in
one
of
the
*NL*
tall
trees
,
making
a
stage
in
its
height
,
an
invisible
bird
,
desperately
*NL*
attempting
to
make
the
day
seem
shorter
,
was
exploring
with
a
long
,
*NL*
continuous
note
the
solitude
that
pressed
it
on
every
side
,
but
it
*NL*
received
at
once
so
unanimous
an
answer
,
so
powerful
a
repercussion
of
*NL*
silence
and
of
immobility
that
,
one
would
have
said
,
it
had
arrested
*NL*
for
all
eternity
the
moment
which
it
had
been
trying
to
make
pass
more
*NL*
quickly
.
The
sunlight
fell
so
implacably
from
a
fixed
sky
that
one
was
*NL*
naturally
inclined
to
slip
away
out
of
the
reach
of
its
attentions
,
and
*NL*
even
the
slumbering
water
,
whose
repose
was
perpetually
being
invaded
by
*NL*
the
insects
that
swarmed
above
its
surface
,
while
it
dreamed
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
of
some
imaginary
maelstrom
,
intensified
the
uneasiness
which
the
sight
*NL*
of
that
floating
cork
had
wrought
in
me
,
by
appearing
to
draw
it
at
*NL*
full
speed
across
the
silent
reaches
of
a
mirrored
firmament
;
now
almost
*NL*
vertical
,
it
seemed
on
the
point
of
plunging
down
out
of
sight
,
and
*NL*
I
had
begun
to
ask
myself
whether
,
setting
aside
the
longing
and
the
*NL*
terror
that
I
had
of
making
her
acquaintance
,
it
was
not
actually
my
*NL*
duty
to
warn
Mlle.
Swann
that
the
fish
was
biting
--
when
I
was
obliged
*NL*
to
run
after
my
father
and
grandfather
,
who
were
calling
me
,
and
were
*NL*
surprised
that
I
had
not
followed
them
along
the
little
path
,
climbing
*NL*
up
hill
towards
the
open
fields
,
into
which
they
had
already
turned
.
I
*NL*
found
the
whole
path
throbbing
with
the
fragrance
of
hawthorn-blossom
.
*NL*
The
hedge
resembled
a
series
of
chapels
,
whose
walls
were
no
longer
*NL*
visible
under
the
mountains
of
flowers
that
were
heaped
upon
their
*NL*
altars
;
while
underneath
,
the
sun
cast
a
square
of
light
upon
the
*NL*
ground
,
as
though
it
had
shone
in
upon
them
through
a
window
;
the
scent
*NL*
that
swept
out
over
me
from
them
was
as
rich
,
and
as
circumscribed
in
*NL*
its
range
,
as
though
I
had
been
standing
before
the
Lady-altar
,
and
*NL*
the
flowers
,
themselves
adorned
also
,
held
out
each
its
little
bunch
of
*NL*
glittering
stamens
with
an
air
of
inattention
,
fine
,
radiating
`
nerves
'
*NL*
in
the
flamboyant
style
of
architecture
,
like
those
which
,
in
church
,
*NL*
framed
the
stair
to
the
rood-loft
or
closed
the
perpendicular
tracery
*NL*
of
the
windows
,
but
here
spread
out
into
pools
of
fleshy
white
,
like
*NL*
strawberry-beds
in
spring
.
How
simple
and
rustic
,
in
comparison
with
*NL*
these
,
would
seem
the
dog-roses
which
,
in
a
few
weeks
'
time
,
would
be
*NL*
climbing
the
same
hillside
path
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
,
dressed
in
the
*NL*
smooth
silk
of
their
blushing
pink
bodices
,
which
would
be
undone
and
*NL*
scattered
by
the
first
breath
of
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
in
vain
that
I
lingered
before
the
hawthorns
,
to
breathe
in
,
*NL*
to
marshal
before
my
mind
-LRB-
which
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
-RRB-
,
to
lose
*NL*
in
order
to
rediscover
their
invisible
and
unchanging
odour
,
to
absorb
*NL*
myself
in
the
rhythm
which
disposed
their
flowers
here
and
there
with
*NL*
the
light-heartedness
of
youth
,
and
at
intervals
as
unexpected
as
*NL*
certain
intervals
of
music
;
they
offered
me
an
indefinite
continuation
*NL*
of
the
same
charm
,
in
an
inexhaustible
profusion
,
but
without
letting
*NL*
me
delve
into
it
any
more
deeply
,
like
those
melodies
which
one
can
play
*NL*
over
a
hundred
times
in
succession
without
coming
any
nearer
to
their
*NL*
secret
.
I
turned
away
from
them
for
a
moment
so
as
to
be
able
to
return
*NL*
to
them
with
renewed
strength
.
My
eyes
followed
up
the
slope
which
,
*NL*
outside
the
hedge
,
rose
steeply
to
the
fields
,
a
poppy
that
had
strayed
*NL*
and
been
lost
by
its
fellows
,
or
a
few
cornflowers
that
had
fallen
*NL*
lazily
behind
,
and
decorated
the
ground
here
and
there
with
their
*NL*
flowers
like
the
border
of
a
tapestry
,
in
which
may
be
seen
at
intervals
*NL*
hints
of
the
rustic
theme
which
appears
triumphant
in
the
panel
itself
;
*NL*
infrequent
still
,
spaced
apart
as
the
scattered
houses
which
warn
us
*NL*
that
we
are
approaching
a
village
,
they
betokened
to
me
the
vast
expanse
*NL*
of
waving
corn
beneath
the
fleecy
clouds
,
and
the
sight
of
a
single
*NL*
poppy
hoisting
upon
its
slender
rigging
and
holding
against
the
breeze
*NL*
its
scarlet
ensign
,
over
the
buoy
of
rich
black
earth
from
which
it
*NL*
sprang
,
made
my
heart
beat
as
does
a
wayfarer
's
when
he
perceives
,
upon
*NL*
some
low-lying
ground
,
an
old
and
broken
boat
which
is
being
caulked
and
*NL*
made
seaworthy
,
and
cries
out
,
although
he
has
not
yet
caught
sight
of
*NL*
it
,
``
The
Sea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
I
returned
to
my
hawthorns
,
and
stood
before
them
as
one
stands
*NL*
before
those
masterpieces
of
painting
which
,
one
imagines
,
one
will
*NL*
be
better
able
to
`
take
in
'
when
one
has
looked
away
,
for
a
moment
,
at
*NL*
something
else
;
but
in
vain
did
I
shape
my
fingers
into
a
frame
,
so
as
*NL*
to
have
nothing
but
the
hawthorns
before
my
eyes
;
the
sentiment
which
*NL*
they
aroused
in
me
remained
obscure
and
vague
,
struggling
and
failing
*NL*
to
free
itself
,
to
float
across
and
become
one
with
the
flowers
.
They
*NL*
themselves
offered
me
no
enlightenment
,
and
I
could
not
call
upon
any
*NL*
other
flowers
to
satisfy
this
mysterious
longing
.
And
then
,
inspiring
*NL*
me
with
that
rapture
which
we
feel
on
seeing
a
work
by
our
favourite
*NL*
painter
quite
different
from
any
of
those
that
we
already
know
,
or
,
*NL*
better
still
,
when
some
one
has
taken
us
and
set
us
down
in
front
of
a
*NL*
picture
of
which
we
have
hitherto
seen
no
more
than
a
pencilled
sketch
,
*NL*
or
when
a
piece
of
music
which
we
have
heard
played
over
on
the
piano
*NL*
bursts
out
again
in
our
ears
with
all
the
splendour
and
fullness
of
an
*NL*
orchestra
,
my
grandfather
called
me
to
him
,
and
,
pointing
to
the
hedge
*NL*
of
Tansonville
,
said
:
``
You
are
fond
of
hawthorns
;
just
look
at
this
pink
*NL*
one
;
is
n't
it
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
indeed
a
hawthorn
,
but
one
whose
flowers
were
pink
,
and
*NL*
lovelier
even
than
the
white
.
It
,
too
,
was
in
holiday
attire
,
for
one
of
*NL*
those
days
which
are
the
only
true
holidays
,
the
holy
days
of
religion
,
*NL*
because
they
are
not
appointed
by
any
capricious
accident
,
as
secular
*NL*
holidays
are
appointed
,
upon
days
which
are
not
specially
ordained
for
*NL*
such
observances
,
which
have
nothing
about
them
that
is
essentially
*NL*
festal
--
but
it
was
attired
even
more
richly
than
the
rest
,
for
the
*NL*
flowers
which
clung
to
its
branches
,
one
above
another
,
so
thickly
as
to
*NL*
leave
no
part
of
the
tree
undecorated
,
like
the
tassels
wreathed
about
*NL*
the
crook
of
a
rococo
shepherdess
,
were
every
one
of
them
`
in
colour
,
'
*NL*
and
consequently
of
a
superior
quality
,
by
the
aesthetic
standards
of
*NL*
Combray
,
to
the
`
plain
,
'
if
one
was
to
judge
by
the
scale
of
prices
*NL*
at
the
`
stores
'
in
the
Square
,
or
at
Camus
's
,
where
the
most
expensive
*NL*
biscuits
were
those
whose
sugar
was
pink
.
And
for
my
own
part
I
set
a
*NL*
higher
value
on
cream
cheese
when
it
was
pink
,
when
I
had
been
allowed
*NL*
to
tinge
it
with
crushed
strawberries
.
And
these
flowers
had
chosen
*NL*
precisely
the
colour
of
some
edible
and
delicious
thing
,
or
of
some
*NL*
exquisite
addition
to
one
's
costume
for
a
great
festival
,
which
colours
,
*NL*
inasmuch
as
they
make
plain
the
reason
for
their
superiority
,
are
those
*NL*
whose
beauty
is
most
evident
to
the
eyes
of
children
,
and
for
that
*NL*
reason
must
always
seem
more
vivid
and
more
natural
than
any
other
*NL*
tints
,
even
after
the
child
's
mind
has
realised
that
they
offer
no
*NL*
gratification
to
the
appetite
,
and
have
not
been
selected
by
the
*NL*
dressmaker
.
And
,
indeed
,
I
had
felt
at
once
,
as
I
had
felt
before
*NL*
the
white
blossom
,
but
now
still
more
marvelling
,
that
it
was
in
no
*NL*
artificial
manner
,
by
no
device
of
human
construction
,
that
the
festal
*NL*
intention
of
these
flowers
was
revealed
,
but
that
it
was
Nature
herself
*NL*
who
had
spontaneously
expressed
it
-LRB-
with
the
simplicity
of
a
woman
from
*NL*
a
village
shop
,
labouring
at
the
decoration
of
a
street
altar
for
some
*NL*
procession
-RRB-
by
burying
the
bush
in
these
little
rosettes
,
almost
too
*NL*
ravishing
in
colour
,
this
rustic
`
pompadour
.
'
High
up
on
the
branches
,
*NL*
like
so
many
of
those
tiny
rose-trees
,
their
pots
concealed
in
jackets
*NL*
of
paper
lace
,
whose
slender
stems
rise
in
a
forest
from
the
altar
on
*NL*
the
greater
festivals
,
a
thousand
buds
were
swelling
and
opening
,
paler
*NL*
in
colour
,
but
each
disclosing
as
it
burst
,
as
at
the
bottom
of
a
cup
of
*NL*
pink
marble
,
its
blood-red
stain
,
and
suggesting
even
more
strongly
*NL*
than
the
full-blown
flowers
the
special
,
irresistible
quality
of
the
*NL*
hawthorn-tree
,
which
,
wherever
it
budded
,
wherever
it
was
about
to
*NL*
blossom
,
could
bud
and
blossom
in
pink
flowers
alone
.
Taking
its
place
*NL*
in
the
hedge
,
but
as
different
from
the
rest
as
a
young
girl
in
holiday
*NL*
attire
among
a
crowd
of
dowdy
women
in
everyday
clothes
,
who
are
staying
*NL*
at
home
,
equipped
and
ready
for
the
`
Month
of
Mary
,
'
of
which
it
seemed
*NL*
already
to
form
a
part
,
it
shone
and
smiled
in
its
cool
,
rosy
garments
,
*NL*
a
Catholic
bush
indeed
,
and
altogether
delightful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hedge
allowed
us
a
glimpse
,
inside
the
park
,
of
an
alley
bordered
*NL*
with
jasmine
,
pansies
,
and
verbenas
,
among
which
the
stocks
held
open
*NL*
their
fresh
plump
purses
,
of
a
pink
as
fragrant
and
as
faded
as
old
*NL*
Spanish
leather
,
while
on
the
gravel-path
a
long
watering-pipe
,
painted
*NL*
green
,
coiling
across
the
ground
,
poured
,
where
its
holes
were
,
over
the
*NL*
flowers
whose
perfume
those
holes
inhaled
,
a
vertical
and
prismatic
fan
*NL*
of
infinitesimal
,
rainbow-coloured
drops
.
Suddenly
I
stood
still
,
unable
*NL*
to
move
,
as
happens
when
something
appears
that
requires
not
only
our
*NL*
eyes
to
take
it
in
,
but
involves
a
deeper
kind
of
perception
and
takes
*NL*
possession
of
the
whole
of
our
being
.
A
little
girl
,
with
fair
,
reddish
*NL*
hair
,
who
appeared
to
be
returning
from
a
walk
,
and
held
a
trowel
in
her
*NL*
hand
,
was
looking
at
us
,
raising
towards
us
a
face
powdered
with
pinkish
*NL*
freckles
.
Her
black
eyes
gleamed
,
and
as
I
did
not
at
that
time
know
,
*NL*
and
indeed
have
never
since
learned
how
to
reduce
to
its
objective
*NL*
elements
any
strong
impression
,
since
I
had
not
,
as
they
say
,
enough
*NL*
`
power
of
observation
'
to
isolate
the
sense
of
their
colour
,
for
a
long
*NL*
time
afterwards
,
whenever
I
thought
of
her
,
the
memory
of
those
bright
*NL*
eyes
would
at
once
present
itself
to
me
as
a
vivid
azure
,
since
her
*NL*
complexion
was
fair
;
so
much
so
that
,
perhaps
,
if
her
eyes
had
not
been
*NL*
quite
so
black
--
which
was
what
struck
one
most
forcibly
on
first
meeting
*NL*
her
--
I
should
not
have
been
,
as
I
was
,
especially
enamoured
of
their
*NL*
imagined
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
gazed
at
her
,
at
first
with
that
gaze
which
is
not
merely
a
messenger
*NL*
from
the
eyes
,
but
in
whose
window
all
the
senses
assemble
and
lean
out
,
*NL*
petrified
and
anxious
,
that
gaze
which
would
fain
reach
,
touch
,
capture
,
*NL*
bear
off
in
triumph
the
body
at
which
it
is
aimed
,
and
the
soul
with
the
*NL*
body
;
then
-LRB-
so
frightened
was
I
lest
at
any
moment
my
grandfather
and
*NL*
father
,
catching
sight
of
the
girl
,
might
tear
me
away
from
her
,
by
*NL*
making
me
run
on
in
front
of
them
-RRB-
with
another
,
an
unconsciously
*NL*
appealing
look
,
whose
object
was
to
force
her
to
pay
attention
to
me
,
to
*NL*
see
,
to
know
me
.
She
cast
a
glance
forwards
and
sideways
,
so
as
to
take
*NL*
stock
of
my
grandfather
and
father
,
and
doubtless
the
impression
she
*NL*
formed
of
them
was
that
we
were
all
absurd
people
,
for
she
turned
away
*NL*
with
an
indifferent
and
contemptuous
air
,
withdrew
herself
so
as
to
*NL*
spare
her
face
the
indignity
of
remaining
within
their
field
of
*NL*
vision
;
and
while
they
,
continuing
to
walk
on
without
noticing
her
,
had
*NL*
overtaken
and
passed
me
,
she
allowed
her
eyes
to
wander
,
over
the
space
*NL*
that
lay
between
us
,
in
my
direction
,
without
any
particular
expression
,
*NL*
without
appearing
to
have
seen
me
,
but
with
an
intensity
,
a
half-hidden
*NL*
smile
which
I
was
unable
to
interpret
,
according
to
the
instruction
I
*NL*
had
received
in
the
ways
of
good
breeding
,
save
as
a
mark
of
infinite
*NL*
disgust
;
and
her
hand
,
at
the
same
time
,
sketched
in
the
air
an
*NL*
indelicate
gesture
,
for
which
,
when
it
was
addressed
in
public
to
a
*NL*
person
whom
one
did
not
know
,
the
little
dictionary
of
manners
which
*NL*
I
carried
in
my
mind
supplied
only
one
meaning
,
namely
,
a
deliberate
*NL*
insult
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gilberte
,
come
along
;
what
are
you
doing
?
''
called
out
in
a
piercing
*NL*
tone
of
authority
a
lady
in
white
,
whom
I
had
not
seen
until
that
*NL*
moment
,
while
,
a
little
way
beyond
her
,
a
gentleman
in
a
suit
of
linen
*NL*
`
ducks
,
'
whom
I
did
not
know
either
,
stared
at
me
with
eyes
which
seemed
*NL*
to
be
starting
from
his
head
;
the
little
girl
's
smile
abruptly
faded
,
*NL*
and
,
seizing
her
trowel
,
she
made
off
without
turning
to
look
again
in
*NL*
my
direction
,
with
an
air
of
obedience
,
inscrutable
and
sly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
was
wafted
to
my
ears
the
name
of
Gilberte
,
bestowed
on
me
like
a
*NL*
talisman
which
might
,
perhaps
,
enable
me
some
day
to
rediscover
her
whom
*NL*
its
syllables
had
just
endowed
with
a
definite
personality
,
whereas
,
a
*NL*
moment
earlier
,
she
had
been
only
something
vaguely
seen
.
So
it
came
*NL*
to
me
,
uttered
across
the
heads
of
the
stocks
and
jasmines
,
pungent
and
*NL*
cool
as
the
drops
which
fell
from
the
green
watering-pipe
;
impregnating
*NL*
and
irradiating
the
zone
of
pure
air
through
which
it
had
passed
,
which
*NL*
it
set
apart
and
isolated
from
all
other
air
,
with
the
mystery
of
the
*NL*
life
of
her
whom
its
syllables
designated
to
the
happy
creatures
that
*NL*
lived
and
walked
and
travelled
in
her
company
;
unfolding
through
the
*NL*
arch
of
the
pink
hawthorn
,
which
opened
at
the
height
of
my
shoulder
,
*NL*
the
quintessence
of
their
familiarity
--
so
exquisitely
painful
to
*NL*
myself
--
with
her
,
and
with
all
that
unknown
world
of
her
existence
,
into
*NL*
which
I
should
never
penetrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
-LRB-
while
we
moved
away
,
and
my
grandfather
murmured
:
``
Poor
*NL*
Swann
,
what
a
life
they
are
leading
him
;
fancy
sending
him
away
so
*NL*
that
she
can
be
left
alone
with
her
Charlus
--
for
that
was
Charlus
:
I
*NL*
recognised
him
at
once
!
And
the
child
,
too
;
at
her
age
,
to
be
mixed
up
*NL*
in
all
that
!
''
-RRB-
the
impression
left
on
me
by
the
despotic
tone
in
which
*NL*
Gilberte
's
mother
had
spoken
to
her
,
without
her
replying
,
by
exhibiting
*NL*
her
to
me
as
being
obliged
to
yield
obedience
to
some
one
else
,
as
not
*NL*
being
indeed
superior
to
the
whole
world
,
calmed
my
sufferings
somewhat
,
*NL*
revived
some
hope
in
me
,
and
cooled
the
ardour
of
my
love
.
But
very
soon
*NL*
that
love
surged
up
again
in
me
like
a
reaction
by
which
my
humiliated
*NL*
heart
was
endeavouring
to
rise
to
Gilberte
's
level
,
or
to
draw
her
down
*NL*
to
its
own
.
I
loved
her
;
I
was
sorry
not
to
have
had
the
time
and
the
*NL*
inspiration
to
insult
her
,
to
do
her
some
injury
,
to
force
her
to
keep
*NL*
some
memory
of
me
.
I
knew
her
to
be
so
beautiful
that
I
should
have
*NL*
liked
to
be
able
to
retrace
my
steps
so
as
to
shake
my
fist
at
her
and
*NL*
shout
,
``
I
think
you
are
hideous
,
grotesque
;
you
are
utterly
disgusting
!
''
*NL*
However
,
I
walked
away
,
carrying
with
me
,
then
and
for
ever
afterwards
,
*NL*
as
the
first
illustration
of
a
type
of
happiness
rendered
inaccessible
*NL*
to
a
little
boy
of
my
kind
by
certain
laws
of
nature
which
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
transgress
,
the
picture
of
a
little
girl
with
reddish
*NL*
hair
,
and
a
skin
freckled
with
tiny
pink
marks
,
who
held
a
trowel
in
*NL*
her
hand
,
and
smiled
as
she
directed
towards
me
a
long
and
subtle
and
*NL*
inexpressive
stare
.
And
already
the
charm
with
which
her
name
,
like
a
*NL*
cloud
of
incense
,
had
filled
that
archway
in
the
pink
hawthorn
through
*NL*
which
she
and
I
had
,
together
,
heard
its
sound
,
was
beginning
to
*NL*
conquer
,
to
cover
,
to
embalm
,
to
beautify
everything
with
which
it
had
*NL*
any
association
:
her
grandparents
,
whom
my
own
had
been
so
unspeakably
*NL*
fortunate
as
to
know
,
the
glorious
profession
of
a
stockholder
,
even
*NL*
the
melancholy
neighbourhood
of
the
Champs-Elys√©es
,
where
she
lived
in
*NL*
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
L√©onie
,
''
said
my
grandfather
on
our
return
,
``
I
wish
we
had
had
you
with
*NL*
us
this
afternoon
.
You
would
never
have
known
Tansonville
.
If
I
had
had
*NL*
the
courage
I
would
have
cut
you
a
branch
of
that
pink
hawthorn
you
used
*NL*
to
like
so
much
.
''
And
so
my
grandfather
told
her
the
story
of
our
walk
,
*NL*
either
just
to
amuse
her
,
or
perhaps
because
there
was
still
some
hope
*NL*
that
she
might
be
stimulated
to
rise
from
her
bed
and
to
go
out
of
*NL*
doors
.
For
in
earlier
days
she
had
been
very
fond
of
Tansonville
,
and
,
*NL*
moreover
,
Swann
's
visits
had
been
the
last
that
she
had
continued
to
*NL*
receive
,
at
a
time
when
she
had
already
closed
her
doors
to
all
the
*NL*
world
.
And
just
as
,
when
he
called
,
in
these
later
days
,
to
inquire
for
*NL*
her
-LRB-
and
she
was
still
the
only
person
in
our
household
whom
he
would
*NL*
ask
to
see
-RRB-
,
she
would
send
down
to
say
that
she
was
tired
at
the
moment
*NL*
and
resting
,
but
that
she
would
be
happy
to
see
him
another
time
,
*NL*
so
,
this
evening
,
she
said
to
my
grandfather
,
``
Yes
,
some
day
when
the
*NL*
weather
is
fine
I
shall
go
for
a
drive
as
far
as
the
gate
of
the
park
.
''
*NL*
And
in
saying
this
she
was
quite
sincere
.
She
would
have
liked
to
see
*NL*
Swann
and
Tansonville
again
;
but
the
mere
wish
to
do
so
sufficed
for
all
*NL*
that
remained
of
her
strength
,
which
its
fulfilment
would
have
more
*NL*
than
exhausted
.
Sometimes
a
spell
of
fine
weather
made
her
a
little
more
*NL*
energetic
,
she
would
rise
and
put
on
her
clothes
;
but
before
she
had
*NL*
reached
the
outer
room
she
would
be
`
tired
'
again
,
and
would
insist
on
*NL*
returning
to
her
bed
.
The
process
which
had
begun
in
her
--
and
in
her
a
*NL*
little
earlier
only
than
it
must
come
to
all
of
us
--
was
the
great
and
*NL*
general
renunciation
which
old
age
makes
in
preparation
for
death
,
the
*NL*
chrysalis
stage
of
life
,
which
may
be
observed
wherever
life
has
been
*NL*
unduly
prolonged
;
even
in
old
lovers
who
have
lived
for
one
another
with
*NL*
the
utmost
intensity
of
passion
,
and
in
old
friends
bound
by
the
closest
*NL*
ties
of
mental
sympathy
,
who
,
after
a
certain
year
,
cease
to
make
,
the
*NL*
necessary
journey
,
or
even
to
cross
the
street
to
see
one
another
,
cease
*NL*
to
correspond
,
and
know
well
that
they
will
communicate
no
more
in
this
*NL*
world
.
My
aunt
must
have
been
perfectly
well
aware
that
she
would
not
*NL*
see
Swann
again
,
that
she
would
never
leave
her
own
house
any
more
,
but
*NL*
this
ultimate
seclusion
seemed
to
be
accepted
by
her
with
all
the
more
*NL*
readiness
for
the
very
reason
which
,
to
our
minds
,
ought
to
have
made
*NL*
it
more
unbearable
;
namely
,
that
such
a
seclusion
was
forced
upon
her
by
*NL*
the
gradual
and
steady
diminution
in
her
strength
which
she
was
able
to
*NL*
measure
daily
,
which
,
by
making
every
action
,
every
movement
`
tiring
'
to
*NL*
her
if
not
actually
painful
,
gave
to
inaction
,
isolation
and
silence
the
*NL*
blessed
,
strengthening
and
refreshing
charm
of
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
did
not
go
to
see
the
pink
hawthorn
in
the
hedge
,
but
at
all
*NL*
hours
of
the
day
I
would
ask
the
rest
of
my
family
whether
she
was
*NL*
not
going
to
go
,
whether
she
used
not
,
at
one
time
,
to
go
often
to
*NL*
Tansonville
,
trying
to
make
them
speak
of
Mlle.
Swann
's
parents
and
*NL*
grandparents
,
who
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
great
and
glorious
as
gods
.
*NL*
The
name
,
which
had
for
me
become
almost
mythological
,
of
Swann
--
when
I
*NL*
talked
with
my
family
I
would
grow
sick
with
longing
to
hear
them
*NL*
utter
it
;
I
dared
not
pronounce
it
myself
,
but
I
would
draw
them
into
a
*NL*
discussion
of
matters
which
led
naturally
to
Gilberte
and
her
family
,
in
*NL*
which
she
was
involved
,
in
speaking
of
which
I
would
feel
myself
not
too
*NL*
remotely
banished
from
her
company
;
and
I
would
suddenly
force
my
father
*NL*
-LRB-
by
pretending
,
for
instance
,
to
believe
that
my
grandfather
's
business
*NL*
had
been
in
our
family
before
his
day
,
or
that
the
hedge
with
the
pink
*NL*
hawthorn
which
my
aunt
L√©onie
wished
to
visit
was
on
common
ground
-RRB-
to
*NL*
correct
my
statements
,
to
say
,
as
though
in
opposition
to
me
and
of
his
*NL*
own
accord
:
``
No
,
no
,
the
business
belonged
to
_
Swann
's
_
father
,
that
*NL*
hedge
is
part
of
_
Swann
's
_
park
.
''
And
then
I
would
be
obliged
to
pause
*NL*
for
breath
;
so
stifling
was
the
pressure
,
upon
that
part
of
me
where
it
*NL*
was
for
ever
inscribed
,
of
that
name
which
,
at
the
moment
when
I
heard
*NL*
it
,
seemed
to
me
fuller
,
more
portentous
than
any
other
name
,
because
*NL*
it
was
burdened
with
the
weight
of
all
the
occasions
on
which
I
had
*NL*
secretly
uttered
it
in
my
mind
.
It
caused
me
a
pleasure
which
I
was
*NL*
ashamed
to
have
dared
to
demand
from
my
parents
,
for
so
great
was
it
*NL*
that
to
have
procured
it
for
me
must
have
involved
them
in
an
immensity
*NL*
of
effort
,
and
with
no
recompense
,
since
for
them
there
was
no
pleasure
*NL*
in
the
sound
.
And
so
I
would
prudently
turn
the
conversation
.
And
by
*NL*
a
scruple
of
conscience
,
also
.
All
the
singular
seductions
which
I
had
*NL*
stored
up
in
the
sound
of
that
word
Swann
,
I
found
again
as
soon
as
it
*NL*
was
uttered
.
And
then
it
occurred
to
me
suddenly
that
my
parents
could
*NL*
not
fail
to
experience
the
same
emotions
,
that
they
must
find
themselves
*NL*
sharing
my
point
of
view
,
that
they
perceived
in
their
turn
,
that
they
*NL*
condoned
,
that
they
even
embraced
my
visionary
longings
,
and
I
was
as
*NL*
wretched
as
though
I
had
ravished
and
corrupted
the
innocence
of
their
*NL*
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
year
my
family
fixed
the
day
of
their
return
to
Paris
rather
*NL*
earlier
than
usual
.
On
the
morning
of
our
departure
I
had
had
my
*NL*
hair
curled
,
to
be
ready
to
face
the
photographer
,
had
had
a
new
hat
*NL*
carefully
set
upon
my
head
,
and
had
been
buttoned
into
a
velvet
jacket
;
*NL*
a
little
later
my
mother
,
after
searching
everywhere
for
me
,
found
me
*NL*
standing
in
tears
on
that
steep
little
hillside
close
to
Tansonville
,
*NL*
bidding
a
long
farewell
to
my
hawthorns
,
clasping
their
sharp
branches
*NL*
to
my
bosom
,
and
-LRB-
like
a
princess
in
a
tragedy
,
oppressed
by
the
weight
*NL*
of
all
her
senseless
jewellery
-RRB-
with
no
gratitude
towards
the
officious
*NL*
hand
which
had
,
in
curling
those
ringlets
,
been
at
pains
to
collect
all
*NL*
my
hair
upon
my
forehead
;
trampling
underfoot
the
curl-papers
which
I
*NL*
had
torn
from
my
head
,
and
my
new
hat
with
them
.
My
mother
was
not
at
*NL*
all
moved
by
my
tears
,
but
she
could
not
suppress
a
cry
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
my
battered
headgear
and
my
ruined
jacket
.
I
did
not
,
however
,
hear
her
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
poor
little
hawthorns
,
''
I
was
assuring
them
through
my
sobs
,
``
it
*NL*
is
not
you
that
want
to
make
me
unhappy
,
to
force
me
to
leave
you
.
*NL*
You
,
you
have
never
done
me
any
harm
.
So
I
shall
always
love
you
.
''
And
,
*NL*
drying
my
eyes
,
I
promised
them
that
,
when
I
grew
up
,
I
would
never
copy
*NL*
the
foolish
example
of
other
men
,
but
that
even
in
Paris
,
on
fine
spring
*NL*
days
,
instead
of
paying
calls
and
listening
to
silly
talk
,
I
would
make
*NL*
excursions
into
the
country
to
see
the
first
hawthorn-trees
in
bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
in
the
fields
we
never
left
them
again
during
the
rest
of
our
*NL*
M√©s√©glise
walk
.
They
were
perpetually
crossed
,
as
though
by
invisible
*NL*
streams
of
traffic
,
by
the
wind
,
which
was
to
me
the
tutelary
genius
of
*NL*
Combray
.
Every
year
,
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
,
in
order
to
feel
that
I
*NL*
really
was
at
Combray
,
I
would
climb
the
hill
to
find
it
running
again
*NL*
through
my
clothing
,
and
setting
me
running
in
its
wake
.
One
always
*NL*
had
the
wind
for
companion
when
one
went
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
,
'
on
*NL*
that
swelling
plain
which
stretched
,
mile
beyond
mile
,
without
any
*NL*
disturbance
of
its
gentle
contour
.
I
knew
that
Mlle.
Swann
used
often
*NL*
to
go
and
spend
a
few
days
at
Laon
,
and
,
for
all
that
it
was
many
*NL*
miles
away
,
the
distance
was
obviated
by
the
absence
of
any
intervening
*NL*
obstacle
;
when
,
on
hot
afternoons
,
I
would
see
a
breath
of
wind
emerge
*NL*
from
the
farthest
horizon
,
bowing
the
heads
of
the
corn
in
distant
*NL*
fields
,
pouring
like
a
flood
over
all
that
vast
expanse
,
and
finally
*NL*
settling
down
,
warm
and
rustling
,
among
the
clover
and
sainfoin
at
my
*NL*
feet
,
that
plain
which
was
common
to
us
both
seemed
then
to
draw
us
*NL*
together
,
to
unite
us
;
I
would
imagine
that
the
same
breath
had
passed
*NL*
by
her
also
,
that
there
was
some
message
from
her
in
what
it
was
*NL*
whispering
to
me
,
without
my
being
able
to
understand
it
,
and
I
would
*NL*
catch
and
kiss
it
as
it
passed
.
On
my
left
was
a
village
called
Champieu
*NL*
-LRB-
_
Campus
Pagani
_
,
according
to
the
Cur√©
-RRB-
.
On
my
right
I
could
see
*NL*
across
the
cornfields
the
two
crocketed
,
rustic
spires
of
*NL*
Saint-Andr√©-des-Champs
,
themselves
as
tapering
,
scaly
,
plated
,
*NL*
honeycombed
,
yellowed
,
and
roughened
as
two
ears
of
wheat
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
regular
intervals
,
among
the
inimitable
ornamentation
of
their
*NL*
leaves
,
which
can
be
mistaken
for
those
of
no
other
fruit-tree
,
the
*NL*
apple-trees
were
exposing
their
broad
petals
of
white
satin
,
or
hanging
*NL*
in
shy
bunches
their
unopened
,
blushing
buds
.
It
was
while
going
*NL*
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
'
that
I
first
noticed
the
circular
shadow
which
*NL*
apple-trees
cast
upon
the
sunlit
ground
,
and
also
those
impalpable
*NL*
threads
of
golden
silk
which
the
setting
sun
weaves
slantingly
downwards
*NL*
from
beneath
their
leaves
,
and
which
I
would
see
my
father
slash
through
*NL*
with
his
stick
without
ever
making
them
swerve
from
their
straight
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
in
the
afternoon
sky
a
white
moon
would
creep
up
like
a
little
*NL*
cloud
,
furtive
,
without
display
,
suggesting
an
actress
who
does
not
have
*NL*
to
`
come
on
'
for
a
while
,
and
so
goes
`
in
front
'
in
her
ordinary
*NL*
clothes
to
watch
the
rest
of
the
company
for
a
moment
,
but
keeps
in
the
*NL*
background
,
not
wishing
to
attract
attention
to
herself
.
I
was
glad
to
*NL*
find
her
image
reproduced
in
books
and
paintings
,
though
these
works
of
*NL*
art
were
very
different
--
at
least
in
my
earlier
years
,
before
Bloch
had
*NL*
attuned
my
eyes
and
mind
to
more
subtle
harmonies
--
from
those
in
*NL*
which
the
moon
seems
fair
to
me
to-day
,
but
in
which
I
should
not
have
*NL*
recognised
her
then
.
It
might
be
,
for
instance
,
some
novel
by
Saintine
,
*NL*
some
landscape
by
Gleyre
,
in
which
she
is
cut
out
sharply
against
the
*NL*
sky
,
in
the
form
of
a
silver
sickle
,
some
work
as
unsophisticated
and
*NL*
as
incomplete
as
were
,
at
that
date
,
my
own
impressions
,
and
which
it
*NL*
enraged
my
grandmother
's
sisters
to
see
me
admire
.
They
held
that
one
*NL*
ought
to
set
before
children
,
and
that
children
shewed
their
own
innate
*NL*
good
taste
in
admiring
,
only
such
books
and
pictures
as
they
would
*NL*
continue
to
admire
when
their
minds
were
developed
and
mature
.
No
doubt
*NL*
they
regarded
aesthetic
values
as
material
objects
which
an
unclouded
*NL*
vision
could
not
fail
to
discern
,
without
needing
to
have
their
*NL*
equivalent
in
experience
of
life
stored
up
and
slowly
ripening
in
one
's
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
along
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
,
'
at
Montjouvain
,
a
house
built
on
the
*NL*
edge
of
a
large
pond
,
and
overlooked
by
a
steep
,
shrub-grown
hill
,
that
*NL*
M.
Vinteuil
lived
.
And
so
we
used
often
to
meet
his
daughter
driving
her
*NL*
dogcart
at
full
speed
along
the
road
.
After
a
certain
year
we
never
*NL*
saw
her
alone
,
but
always
accompanied
by
a
friend
,
a
girl
older
than
*NL*
herself
,
with
an
evil
reputation
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
in
the
end
*NL*
installed
herself
permanently
,
one
day
,
at
Montjouvain
.
People
said
:
*NL*
``
That
poor
M.
Vinteuil
must
be
blinded
by
love
not
to
see
what
everyone
*NL*
is
talking
about
,
and
to
let
his
daughter
--
a
man
who
is
horrified
if
you
*NL*
use
a
word
in
the
wrong
sense
--
bring
a
woman
like
that
to
live
under
his
*NL*
roof
.
He
says
that
she
is
a
most
superior
woman
,
with
a
heart
of
gold
,
*NL*
and
that
she
would
have
shewn
extraordinary
musical
talent
if
she
had
*NL*
only
been
trained
.
He
may
be
sure
it
is
not
music
that
she
is
teaching
*NL*
his
daughter
.
''
But
M.
Vinteuil
assured
them
that
it
was
,
and
indeed
*NL*
it
is
remarkable
that
people
never
fail
to
arouse
admiration
of
their
*NL*
normal
qualities
in
the
relatives
of
anyone
with
whom
they
are
in
*NL*
physical
intercourse
.
Bodily
passion
,
which
has
been
so
unjustly
*NL*
decried
,
compels
its
victims
to
display
every
vestige
that
is
in
them
*NL*
of
unselfishness
and
generosity
,
and
so
effectively
that
they
shine
*NL*
resplendent
in
the
eyes
of
all
beholders
.
Dr.
Percepied
,
whose
loud
*NL*
voice
and
bushy
eyebrows
enabled
him
to
play
to
his
heart
's
content
the
*NL*
part
of
`
double-dealer
,
'
a
part
to
which
he
was
not
,
otherwise
,
adapted
,
*NL*
without
in
the
least
degree
compromising
his
unassailable
and
quite
*NL*
unmerited
reputation
of
being
a
kind-hearted
old
curmudgeon
,
could
make
*NL*
the
Cur√©
and
everyone
else
laugh
until
they
cried
by
saying
in
a
harsh
*NL*
voice
:
``
What
d'ye
say
to
this
,
now
?
It
seems
that
she
plays
music
with
*NL*
her
friend
,
Mlle.
Vinteuil
.
That
surprises
you
,
does
it
?
Oh
,
I
know
*NL*
nothing
,
nothing
at
all
.
It
was
Papa
Vinteuil
who
told
me
all
about
*NL*
it
yesterday
.
After
all
,
she
has
every
right
to
be
fond
of
music
,
that
*NL*
girl
.
I
should
never
dream
of
thwarting
the
artistic
vocation
of
a
*NL*
child
;
nor
Vinteuil
either
,
it
seems
.
And
then
he
plays
music
too
,
*NL*
with
his
daughter
's
friend
.
Why
,
gracious
heavens
,
it
must
be
a
regular
*NL*
musical
box
,
that
house
out
there
!
What
are
you
laughing
at
?
I
say
*NL*
they
've
been
playing
too
much
music
,
those
people
.
I
met
Papa
Vinteuil
*NL*
the
other
day
,
by
the
cemetery
.
It
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
on
his
*NL*
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anyone
who
,
like
ourselves
,
had
seen
M.
Vinteuil
,
about
this
time
,
*NL*
avoiding
people
whom
he
knew
,
and
turning
away
as
soon
as
he
caught
*NL*
sight
of
them
,
changed
in
a
few
months
into
an
old
man
,
engulfed
in
a
*NL*
sea
of
sorrows
,
incapable
of
any
effort
not
directly
aimed
at
promoting
*NL*
his
daughter
's
happiness
,
spending
whole
days
beside
his
wife
's
grave
,
*NL*
could
hardly
have
failed
to
realise
that
he
was
gradually
dying
of
a
*NL*
broken
heart
,
could
hardly
have
supposed
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
*NL*
the
rumours
which
were
going
about
.
He
knew
,
perhaps
he
even
believed
,
*NL*
what
his
neighbours
were
saying
.
There
is
probably
no
one
,
however
rigid
*NL*
his
virtue
,
who
is
not
liable
to
find
himself
,
by
the
complexity
of
*NL*
circumstances
,
living
at
close
quarters
with
the
very
vice
which
*NL*
he
himself
has
been
most
outspoken
in
condemning
,
without
at
first
*NL*
recognising
it
beneath
the
disguise
which
it
assumes
on
entering
his
*NL*
presence
,
so
as
to
wound
him
and
to
make
him
suffer
;
the
odd
words
,
the
*NL*
unaccountable
attitude
,
one
evening
,
of
a
person
whom
he
has
a
thousand
*NL*
reasons
for
loving
.
But
for
a
man
of
M.
Vinteuil
's
sensibility
it
must
*NL*
have
been
far
more
painful
than
for
a
hardened
man
of
the
world
to
have
*NL*
to
resign
himself
to
one
of
those
situations
which
are
wrongly
supposed
*NL*
to
occur
in
Bohemian
circles
only
;
for
they
are
produced
whenever
there
*NL*
needs
to
establish
itself
in
the
security
necessary
to
its
development
a
*NL*
vice
which
Nature
herself
has
planted
in
the
soul
of
a
child
,
perhaps
by
*NL*
no
more
than
blending
the
virtues
of
its
father
and
mother
,
as
she
might
*NL*
blend
the
colours
of
their
eyes
.
And
yet
however
much
M.
Vinteuil
*NL*
may
have
known
of
his
daughter
's
conduct
it
did
not
follow
that
his
*NL*
adoration
of
her
grew
any
less
.
The
facts
of
life
do
not
penetrate
to
*NL*
the
sphere
in
which
our
beliefs
are
cherished
;
as
it
was
not
they
that
*NL*
engendered
those
beliefs
,
so
they
are
powerless
to
destroy
them
;
they
*NL*
can
aim
at
them
continual
blows
of
contradiction
and
disproof
without
*NL*
weakening
them
;
and
an
avalanche
of
miseries
and
maladies
coming
,
one
*NL*
after
another
,
without
interruption
into
the
bosom
of
a
family
,
will
not
*NL*
make
it
lose
faith
in
either
the
clemency
of
its
God
or
the
capacity
of
*NL*
its
physician
.
But
when
M.
Vinteuil
regarded
his
daughter
and
himself
*NL*
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
world
,
and
of
their
reputation
,
when
he
*NL*
attempted
to
place
himself
by
her
side
in
the
rank
which
they
occupied
*NL*
in
the
general
estimation
of
their
neighbours
,
then
he
was
bound
to
give
*NL*
judgment
,
to
utter
his
own
and
her
social
condemnation
in
precisely
*NL*
the
terms
which
the
inhabitant
of
Combray
most
hostile
to
him
and
his
*NL*
daughter
would
have
employed
;
he
saw
himself
and
her
in
`
low
,
'
in
the
*NL*
very
`
lowest
water
,
'
inextricably
stranded
;
and
his
manners
had
of
late
*NL*
been
tinged
with
that
humility
,
that
respect
for
persons
who
ranked
*NL*
above
him
and
to
whom
he
must
now
look
up
-LRB-
however
far
beneath
him
they
*NL*
might
hitherto
have
been
-RRB-
,
that
tendency
to
search
for
some
means
of
*NL*
rising
again
to
their
level
,
which
is
an
almost
mechanical
result
of
any
*NL*
human
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
we
were
walking
with
Swann
in
one
of
the
streets
of
*NL*
Combray
,
M.
Vinteuil
,
turning
out
of
another
street
,
found
himself
so
*NL*
suddenly
face
to
face
with
us
all
that
he
had
not
time
to
escape
;
and
*NL*
Swann
,
with
that
almost
arrogant
charity
of
a
man
of
the
world
who
,
*NL*
amid
the
dissolution
of
all
his
own
moral
prejudices
,
finds
in
another
's
*NL*
shame
merely
a
reason
for
treating
him
with
a
friendly
benevolence
,
the
*NL*
outward
signs
of
which
serve
to
enhance
and
gratify
the
self-esteem
of
*NL*
the
bestower
because
he
feels
that
they
are
all
the
more
precious
to
him
*NL*
upon
whom
they
are
bestowed
,
conversed
at
great
length
with
M.
Vinteuil
,
*NL*
with
whom
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
barely
on
speaking
terms
,
and
*NL*
invited
him
,
before
leaving
us
,
to
send
his
daughter
over
,
one
day
,
*NL*
to
play
at
Tansonville
.
It
was
an
invitation
which
,
two
years
earlier
,
*NL*
would
have
enraged
M.
Vinteuil
,
but
which
now
filled
him
with
so
much
*NL*
gratitude
that
he
felt
himself
obliged
to
refrain
from
the
indiscretion
*NL*
of
accepting
.
Swann
's
friendly
regard
for
his
daughter
seemed
to
him
to
*NL*
be
in
itself
so
honourable
,
so
precious
a
support
for
his
cause
that
he
*NL*
felt
it
would
perhaps
be
better
to
make
no
use
of
it
,
so
as
to
have
the
*NL*
wholly
Platonic
satisfaction
of
keeping
it
in
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
charming
man
!
''
he
said
to
us
,
after
Swann
had
gone
,
with
the
*NL*
same
enthusiasm
and
veneration
which
make
clever
and
pretty
women
of
the
*NL*
middle
classes
fall
victims
to
the
physical
and
intellectual
charms
of
a
*NL*
duchess
,
even
though
she
be
ugly
and
a
fool
.
``
What
a
charming
man
!
What
*NL*
a
pity
that
he
should
have
made
such
a
deplorable
marriage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
so
strong
an
element
of
hypocrisy
is
there
in
even
the
most
*NL*
sincere
of
men
,
who
cast
off
,
while
they
are
talking
to
anyone
,
the
*NL*
opinion
they
actually
hold
of
him
and
will
express
when
he
is
no
longer
*NL*
there
,
my
family
joined
with
M.
Vinteuil
in
deploring
Swann
's
marriage
,
*NL*
invoking
principles
and
conventions
which
-LRB-
all
the
more
because
they
*NL*
invoked
them
in
common
with
him
,
as
though
we
were
all
thorough
good
*NL*
fellows
of
the
same
sort
-RRB-
they
appeared
to
suggest
were
in
no
way
*NL*
infringed
at
Montjouvain
.
M.
Vinteuil
did
not
send
his
daughter
to
visit
*NL*
Swann
,
an
omission
which
Swann
was
the
first
to
regret
.
For
constantly
,
*NL*
after
meeting
M.
Vinteuil
,
he
would
remember
that
he
had
been
meaning
*NL*
for
a
long
time
to
ask
him
about
some
one
of
the
same
name
as
himself
,
*NL*
one
of
his
relatives
,
Swann
supposed
.
And
on
this
occasion
he
determined
*NL*
that
he
would
not
forget
what
he
had
to
say
to
him
when
M.
Vinteuil
*NL*
should
appear
with
his
daughter
at
Tansonville
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
'
was
the
shorter
of
the
two
that
we
used
to
*NL*
take
for
our
walks
round
Combray
,
and
for
that
reason
was
reserved
for
*NL*
days
of
uncertain
weather
,
it
followed
that
the
climate
of
M√©s√©glise
*NL*
shewed
an
unduly
high
rainfall
,
and
we
would
never
lose
sight
of
the
*NL*
fringe
of
Roussainville
wood
,
so
that
we
could
,
at
any
moment
,
run
for
*NL*
shelter
beneath
its
dense
thatch
of
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
the
sun
would
disappear
behind
a
cloud
,
which
impinged
on
its
*NL*
roundness
,
but
whose
edge
the
sun
gilded
in
return
.
The
brightness
,
*NL*
though
not
the
light
of
day
,
would
then
be
shut
off
from
a
landscape
*NL*
in
which
all
life
appeared
to
be
suspended
,
while
the
little
village
*NL*
of
Roussainville
carved
in
relief
upon
the
sky
the
white
mass
of
its
*NL*
gables
,
with
a
startling
precision
of
detail
.
A
gust
of
wind
blew
from
*NL*
its
perch
a
rook
,
which
floated
away
and
settled
in
the
distance
,
while
*NL*
beneath
a
paling
sky
the
woods
on
the
horizon
assumed
a
deeper
tone
of
*NL*
blue
,
as
though
they
were
painted
in
one
of
those
cameos
which
you
still
*NL*
find
decorating
the
walls
of
old
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
other
days
would
begin
to
fall
the
rain
,
of
which
we
had
had
due
*NL*
warning
from
the
little
barometer-figure
which
the
spectacle-maker
hung
*NL*
out
in
his
doorway
.
Its
drops
,
like
migrating
birds
which
fly
off
in
a
*NL*
body
at
a
given
moment
,
would
come
down
out
of
the
sky
in
close
marching
*NL*
order
.
They
would
never
drift
apart
,
would
make
no
movement
at
random
in
*NL*
their
rapid
course
,
but
each
one
,
keeping
in
its
place
,
would
draw
*NL*
after
it
the
drop
which
was
following
,
and
the
sky
would
be
as
greatly
*NL*
darkened
as
by
the
swallows
flying
south
.
We
would
take
refuge
among
the
*NL*
trees
.
And
when
it
seemed
that
their
flight
was
accomplished
,
a
few
last
*NL*
drops
,
feebler
and
slower
than
the
rest
,
would
still
come
down
.
But
we
*NL*
would
emerge
from
our
shelter
,
for
the
rain
was
playing
a
game
,
now
,
*NL*
among
the
branches
,
and
,
even
when
it
was
almost
dry
again
underfoot
,
a
*NL*
stray
drop
or
two
,
lingering
in
the
hollow
of
a
leaf
,
would
run
down
and
*NL*
hang
glistening
from
the
point
of
it
until
suddenly
it
splashed
plump
*NL*
upon
our
upturned
faces
from
the
whole
height
of
the
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
too
,
we
would
hurry
for
shelter
,
tumbling
in
among
all
its
stony
*NL*
saints
and
patriarchs
,
into
the
porch
of
Saint-Andr√©-des-Champs
,
How
*NL*
typically
French
that
church
was
!
Over
its
door
the
saints
,
the
kings
*NL*
of
chivalry
with
lilies
in
their
hands
,
the
wedding
scenes
and
funerals
*NL*
were
carved
as
they
might
have
been
in
the
mind
of
Fran√ßoise
.
The
*NL*
sculptor
had
also
recorded
certain
anecdotes
of
Aristotle
and
Virgil
,
*NL*
precisely
as
Fran√ßoise
in
her
kitchen
would
break
into
speech
about
*NL*
Saint
Louis
as
though
she
herself
had
known
him
,
generally
in
order
to
*NL*
depreciate
,
by
contrast
with
him
,
my
grandparents
,
whom
she
considered
*NL*
less
`
righteous
.
'
One
could
see
that
the
ideas
which
the
mediaeval
*NL*
artist
and
the
mediaeval
peasant
-LRB-
who
had
survived
to
cook
for
us
in
*NL*
the
nineteenth
century
-RRB-
had
of
classical
and
of
early
Christian
history
,
*NL*
ideas
whose
inaccuracy
was
atoned
for
by
their
honest
simplicity
,
were
*NL*
derived
not
from
books
,
but
from
a
tradition
at
once
ancient
and
direct
,
*NL*
unbroken
,
oral
,
degraded
,
unrecognisable
,
and
alive
.
Another
Combray
*NL*
person
whom
I
could
discern
also
,
potential
and
typified
,
in
the
gothic
*NL*
sculptures
of
Saint-Andr√©-des-Champs
was
young
Th√©odore
,
the
assistant
*NL*
in
Camus
's
shop
.
And
,
indeed
,
Fran√ßoise
herself
was
well
aware
that
she
*NL*
had
in
him
a
countryman
and
contemporary
,
for
when
my
aunt
was
too
ill
*NL*
for
Fran√ßoise
to
be
able
,
unaided
,
to
lift
her
in
her
bed
or
to
carry
*NL*
her
to
her
chair
,
rather
than
let
the
kitchen-maid
come
upstairs
*NL*
and
,
perhaps
,
`
make
an
impression
'
on
my
aunt
,
she
would
send
out
for
*NL*
Th√©odore
.
And
this
lad
,
who
was
regarded
,
and
quite
rightly
,
in
the
town
*NL*
as
a
`
bad
character
,
'
was
so
abounding
in
that
spirit
which
had
served
*NL*
to
decorate
the
porch
of
Saint-Andr√©-des-Champs
,
and
particularly
in
the
*NL*
feelings
of
respect
due
,
in
Fran√ßoise
eyes
,
to
all
`
poor
invalids
,
'
and
,
*NL*
above
all
,
to
her
own
`
poor
mistress
,
'
that
he
had
,
when
he
bent
down
*NL*
to
raise
my
aunt
's
head
from
her
pillow
,
the
same
air
of
pr√©rapha√©lite
*NL*
simplicity
and
zeal
which
the
little
angels
in
the
bas-reliefs
wear
,
who
*NL*
throng
,
with
tapers
in
their
hands
,
about
the
deathbed
of
Our
Lady
,
as
*NL*
though
those
carved
faces
of
stone
,
naked
and
grey
like
trees
in
winter
,
*NL*
were
,
like
them
,
asleep
only
,
storing
up
life
and
waiting
to
flower
*NL*
again
in
countless
plebeian
faces
,
reverend
and
cunning
as
the
face
of
*NL*
Th√©odore
,
and
glowing
with
the
ruddy
brilliance
of
ripe
apples
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
too
,
not
fastened
to
the
wall
like
the
little
angels
,
but
*NL*
detached
from
the
porch
,
of
more
than
human
stature
,
erect
upon
her
*NL*
pedestal
as
upon
a
footstool
,
which
had
been
placed
there
to
save
her
*NL*
feet
from
contact
with
the
wet
ground
,
stood
a
saint
with
the
full
*NL*
cheeks
,
the
firm
breasts
which
swelled
out
inside
her
draperies
like
*NL*
a
cluster
of
ripe
grapes
inside
a
bag
,
the
narrow
forehead
,
short
and
*NL*
stubborn
nose
,
deep-set
eyes
,
and
strong
,
thick-skinned
,
courageous
*NL*
expression
of
the
country-women
of
those
parts
.
This
similarity
,
which
*NL*
imparted
to
the
statue
itself
a
kindliness
that
I
had
not
looked
to
*NL*
find
in
it
,
was
corroborated
often
by
the
arrival
of
some
girl
from
*NL*
the
fields
,
come
,
like
ourselves
,
for
shelter
beneath
the
porch
,
whose
*NL*
presence
there
--
as
when
the
leaves
of
a
climbing
plant
have
grown
up
*NL*
beside
leaves
carved
in
stone
--
seemed
intended
by
fate
to
allow
us
,
by
*NL*
confronting
it
with
its
type
in
nature
,
to
form
a
critical
estimate
*NL*
of
the
truth
of
the
work
of
art
.
Before
our
eyes
,
in
the
distance
,
a
*NL*
promised
or
an
accursed
land
,
Roussainville
,
within
whose
walls
I
had
*NL*
never
penetrated
,
Roussainville
was
now
,
when
the
rain
had
ceased
for
*NL*
us
,
still
being
chastised
,
like
a
village
in
the
Old
Testament
,
by
*NL*
all
the
innumerable
spears
and
arrows
of
the
storm
,
which
beat
down
*NL*
obliquely
upon
the
dwellings
of
its
inhabitants
,
or
else
had
already
*NL*
received
the
forgiveness
of
the
Almighty
,
Who
had
restored
to
it
the
*NL*
light
of
His
sun
,
which
fell
upon
it
in
rays
of
uneven
length
,
like
the
*NL*
rays
of
a
monstrance
upon
an
altar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
when
the
weather
had
completely
broken
,
we
were
obliged
to
go
*NL*
home
and
to
remain
shut
up
indoors
.
Here
and
there
,
in
the
distance
,
in
*NL*
a
landscape
which
,
what
with
the
failing
light
and
saturated
atmosphere
,
*NL*
resembled
a
seascape
rather
,
a
few
solitary
houses
clinging
to
the
lower
*NL*
slopes
of
a
hill
whose
heights
were
buried
in
a
cloudy
darkness
shone
*NL*
out
like
little
boats
which
had
folded
their
sails
and
would
ride
at
*NL*
anchor
,
all
night
,
upon
the
sea
.
But
what
mattered
rain
or
storm
?
*NL*
In
summer
,
bad
weather
is
no
more
than
a
passing
fit
of
superficial
*NL*
ill-temper
expressed
by
the
permanent
,
underlying
fine
weather
;
a
very
*NL*
different
thing
from
the
fluid
and
unstable
`
fine
weather
'
of
winter
,
*NL*
its
very
opposite
,
in
fact
;
for
has
it
not
-LRB-
firmly
established
in
the
*NL*
soil
,
on
which
it
has
taken
solid
form
in
dense
masses
of
foliage
over
*NL*
which
the
rain
may
pour
in
torrents
without
weakening
the
resistance
*NL*
offered
by
their
real
and
lasting
happiness
-RRB-
hoisted
,
to
keep
them
*NL*
flying
throughout
the
season
,
in
the
village
streets
,
on
the
walls
of
*NL*
the
houses
and
in
their
gardens
,
its
silken
banners
,
violet
and
white
.
*NL*
Sitting
in
the
little
parlour
,
where
I
would
pass
the
time
until
dinner
*NL*
with
a
book
,
I
might
hear
the
water
dripping
from
our
chestnut-trees
,
*NL*
but
I
would
know
that
the
shower
would
only
glaze
and
brighten
the
*NL*
greenness
of
their
thick
,
crumpled
leaves
,
and
that
they
themselves
*NL*
had
undertaken
to
remain
there
,
like
pledges
of
summer
,
all
through
the
*NL*
rainy
night
,
to
assure
me
of
the
fine
weather
's
continuing
;
it
might
*NL*
rain
as
it
pleased
,
but
to-morrow
,
over
the
white
fence
of
Tansonville
,
*NL*
there
would
surge
and
flow
,
numerous
as
ever
,
a
sea
of
little
*NL*
heart-shaped
leaves
;
and
without
the
least
anxiety
I
could
watch
the
*NL*
poplar
in
the
Rue
des
Perchamps
praying
for
mercy
,
bowing
in
desperation
*NL*
before
the
storm
;
without
the
least
anxiety
I
could
hear
,
at
the
far
end
*NL*
of
the
garden
,
the
last
peals
of
thunder
growling
among
our
lilac-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
weather
was
bad
all
morning
,
my
family
would
abandon
the
idea
of
*NL*
a
walk
,
and
I
would
remain
at
home
.
But
,
later
on
,
I
formed
the
habit
*NL*
of
going
out
by
myself
on
such
days
,
and
walking
towards
*NL*
M√©s√©glise-la-Vineuse
,
during
that
autumn
when
we
had
to
come
to
Combray
*NL*
to
settle
the
division
of
my
aunt
L√©onie
's
estate
;
for
she
had
died
at
*NL*
last
,
leaving
both
parties
among
her
neighbours
triumphant
in
the
*NL*
fact
of
her
demise
--
those
who
had
insisted
that
her
mode
of
life
was
*NL*
enfeebling
and
must
ultimately
kill
her
,
and
,
equally
,
those
who
had
*NL*
always
maintained
that
she
suffered
from
some
disease
not
imaginary
,
*NL*
but
organic
,
by
the
visible
proof
of
which
the
most
sceptical
would
*NL*
be
obliged
to
own
themselves
convinced
,
once
she
had
succumbed
to
it
;
*NL*
causing
no
intense
grief
to
any
save
one
of
her
survivors
,
but
to
that
*NL*
one
a
grief
savage
in
its
violence
.
During
the
long
fortnight
of
my
*NL*
aunt
's
last
illness
Fran√ßoise
never
went
out
of
her
room
for
an
instant
,
*NL*
never
took
off
her
clothes
,
allowed
no
one
else
to
do
anything
for
my
*NL*
aunt
,
and
did
not
leave
her
body
until
it
was
actually
in
its
grave
.
*NL*
Then
,
at
last
,
we
understood
that
the
sort
of
terror
in
which
Fran√ßoise
*NL*
had
lived
of
my
aunt
's
harsh
words
,
her
suspicions
and
her
anger
,
had
*NL*
developed
in
her
a
sentiment
which
we
had
mistaken
for
hatred
,
and
which
*NL*
was
really
veneration
and
love
.
Her
true
mistress
,
whose
decisions
it
*NL*
had
been
impossible
to
foresee
,
from
whose
stratagems
it
had
been
*NL*
so
hard
to
escape
,
of
whose
good
nature
it
had
been
so
easy
to
take
*NL*
advantage
,
her
sovereign
,
her
mysterious
and
omnipotent
monarch
was
no
*NL*
more
.
Compared
with
such
a
mistress
we
counted
for
very
little
.
The
*NL*
time
had
long
passed
when
,
on
our
first
coming
to
spend
our
holidays
*NL*
at
Combray
,
we
had
been
of
equal
importance
,
in
Fran√ßoise
eyes
,
with
my
*NL*
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
that
autumn
my
parents
,
finding
the
days
so
fully
occupied
with
*NL*
the
legal
formalities
that
had
to
be
gone
through
,
and
discussions
with
*NL*
solicitors
and
farmers
,
that
they
had
little
time
for
walks
which
,
as
it
*NL*
happened
,
the
weather
made
precarious
,
began
to
let
me
go
,
without
them
,
*NL*
along
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
,
'
wrapped
up
in
a
huge
Highland
plaid
which
*NL*
protected
me
from
the
rain
,
and
which
I
was
all
the
more
ready
to
throw
*NL*
over
my
shoulders
because
I
felt
that
the
stripes
of
its
gaudy
tartan
*NL*
scandalised
Fran√ßoise
,
whom
it
was
impossible
to
convince
that
the
*NL*
colour
of
one
's
clothes
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
one
's
mourning
*NL*
for
the
dead
,
and
to
whom
the
grief
which
we
had
shewn
on
my
aunt
's
*NL*
death
was
wholly
unsatisfactory
,
since
we
had
not
entertained
the
*NL*
neighbours
to
a
great
funeral
banquet
,
and
did
not
adopt
a
special
tone
*NL*
when
we
spoke
of
her
,
while
I
at
times
might
be
heard
humming
a
tune
.
I
*NL*
am
sure
that
in
a
book
--
and
to
that
extent
my
feelings
were
closely
akin
*NL*
to
those
of
Fran√ßoise
--
such
a
conception
of
mourning
,
in
the
manner
*NL*
of
the
_
Chanson
de
Roland
_
and
of
the
porch
of
Saint-Andr√©-des-Champs
,
*NL*
would
have
seemed
most
attractive
.
But
the
moment
that
Fran√ßoise
herself
*NL*
approached
,
some
evil
spirit
would
urge
me
to
attempt
to
make
her
angry
,
*NL*
and
I
would
avail
myself
of
the
slightest
pretext
to
say
to
her
that
I
*NL*
regretted
my
aunt
's
death
because
she
had
been
a
good
woman
in
spite
of
*NL*
her
absurdities
,
but
not
in
the
least
because
she
was
my
aunt
;
that
*NL*
she
might
easily
have
been
my
aunt
and
yet
have
been
so
odious
that
her
*NL*
death
would
not
have
caused
me
a
moment
's
sorrow
;
statements
which
,
in
a
*NL*
book
,
would
have
struck
me
as
merely
fatuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
Fran√ßoise
then
,
inspired
like
a
poet
with
a
flood
of
confused
*NL*
reflections
upon
bereavement
,
grief
,
and
family
memories
,
were
to
*NL*
plead
her
inability
to
rebut
my
theories
,
saying
:
``
I
do
n't
know
how
to
*NL*
_
espress
_
myself
''
--
I
would
triumph
over
her
with
an
ironical
and
brutal
*NL*
common
sense
worthy
of
Dr.
Percepied
;
and
if
she
went
on
:
``
All
the
same
*NL*
she
was
a
_
geological
_
relation
;
there
is
always
the
respect
due
to
your
*NL*
_
geology
_
,
''
I
would
shrug
my
shoulders
and
say
:
``
It
is
really
very
good
*NL*
of
me
to
discuss
the
matter
with
an
illiterate
old
woman
who
can
not
*NL*
speak
her
own
language
,
''
adopting
,
to
deliver
judgment
on
Fran√ßoise
,
*NL*
the
mean
and
narrow
outlook
of
the
pedant
,
whom
those
who
are
most
*NL*
contemptuous
of
him
in
the
impartiality
of
their
own
minds
are
only
too
*NL*
prone
to
copy
when
they
are
obliged
to
play
a
part
upon
the
vulgar
stage
*NL*
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
walks
,
that
autumn
,
were
all
the
more
delightful
because
I
used
*NL*
to
take
them
after
long
hours
spent
over
a
book
.
When
I
was
tired
of
*NL*
reading
,
after
a
whole
morning
in
the
house
,
I
would
throw
my
plaid
*NL*
across
my
shoulders
and
set
out
;
my
body
,
which
in
a
long
spell
of
*NL*
enforced
immobility
had
stored
up
an
accumulation
of
vital
energy
,
was
*NL*
now
obliged
,
like
a
spinning-top
wound
and
let
go
,
to
spend
this
in
*NL*
every
direction
.
The
walls
of
houses
,
the
Tansonville
hedge
,
the
trees
*NL*
of
Roussainville
wood
,
the
bushes
against
which
Montjouvain
leaned
its
*NL*
back
,
all
must
bear
the
blows
of
my
walking-stick
or
umbrella
,
must
*NL*
hear
my
shouts
of
happiness
,
blows
and
shouts
being
indeed
no
more
than
*NL*
expressions
of
the
confused
ideas
which
exhilarated
me
,
and
which
,
not
*NL*
being
developed
to
the
point
at
which
they
might
rest
exposed
to
the
*NL*
light
of
day
,
rather
than
submit
to
a
slow
and
difficult
course
*NL*
of
elucidation
,
found
it
easier
and
more
pleasant
to
drift
into
an
*NL*
immediate
outlet
.
And
so
it
is
that
the
bulk
of
what
appear
to
be
the
*NL*
emotional
renderings
of
our
inmost
sensations
do
no
more
than
relieve
us
*NL*
of
the
burden
of
those
sensations
by
allowing
them
to
escape
from
us
in
*NL*
an
indistinct
form
which
does
not
teach
us
how
it
should
be
interpreted
.
*NL*
When
I
attempt
to
reckon
up
all
that
I
owe
to
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
,
'
all
*NL*
the
humble
discoveries
of
which
it
was
either
the
accidental
setting
or
*NL*
the
direct
inspiration
and
cause
,
I
am
reminded
that
it
was
in
that
same
*NL*
autumn
,
on
one
of
those
walks
,
near
the
bushy
precipice
which
guarded
*NL*
Montjouvain
from
the
rear
,
that
I
was
struck
for
the
first
time
by
*NL*
this
lack
of
harmony
between
our
impressions
and
their
normal
forms
of
*NL*
expression
.
After
an
hour
of
rain
and
wind
,
against
which
I
had
put
up
a
*NL*
brisk
fight
,
as
I
came
to
the
edge
of
the
Montjouvain
pond
,
and
reached
*NL*
a
little
hut
,
roofed
with
tiles
,
in
which
M.
Vinteuil
's
gardener
kept
*NL*
his
tools
,
the
sun
shone
out
again
,
and
its
golden
rays
,
washed
clean
*NL*
by
the
shower
,
blazed
once
more
in
the
sky
,
on
the
trees
,
on
the
wall
*NL*
of
the
hut
,
and
on
the
still
wet
tiles
of
the
roof
,
which
had
a
chicken
*NL*
perching
upon
its
ridge
.
The
wind
pulled
out
sideways
the
wild
grass
*NL*
that
grew
in
the
wall
,
and
the
chicken
's
downy
feathers
,
both
of
which
*NL*
things
let
themselves
float
upon
the
wind
's
breath
to
their
full
extent
,
*NL*
with
the
unresisting
submissiveness
of
light
and
lifeless
matter
.
The
*NL*
tiled
roof
cast
upon
the
pond
,
whose
reflections
were
now
clear
again
*NL*
in
the
sunlight
,
a
square
of
pink
marble
,
the
like
of
which
I
had
never
*NL*
observed
before
.
And
,
seeing
upon
the
water
,
where
it
reflected
the
*NL*
wall
,
a
pallid
smile
responding
to
the
smiling
sky
,
I
cried
aloud
in
my
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
brandishing
my
furled
umbrella
:
``
Damn
,
damn
,
damn
,
damn
!
''
*NL*
But
at
the
same
time
I
felt
that
I
was
in
duty
bound
not
to
content
*NL*
myself
with
these
unilluminating
words
,
but
to
endeavour
to
see
more
*NL*
clearly
into
the
sources
of
my
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
at
that
moment
,
too
--
thanks
to
a
peasant
who
went
past
,
*NL*
apparently
in
a
bad
enough
humour
already
,
but
more
so
when
he
nearly
*NL*
received
my
umbrella
in
his
face
,
and
who
replied
without
any
cordiality
*NL*
to
my
``
Fine
day
,
what
!
good
to
be
out
walking
!
''
--
that
I
learned
*NL*
that
identical
emotions
do
not
spring
up
in
the
hearts
of
all
men
*NL*
simultaneously
,
by
a
pre-established
order
.
Later
on
I
discovered
that
,
*NL*
whenever
I
had
read
for
too
long
and
was
in
a
mood
for
conversation
,
the
*NL*
friend
to
whom
I
would
be
burning
to
say
something
would
at
that
moment
*NL*
have
finished
indulging
himself
in
the
delights
of
conversation
,
and
*NL*
wanted
nothing
now
but
to
be
left
to
read
undisturbed
.
And
if
I
had
been
*NL*
thinking
with
affection
of
my
parents
,
and
forming
the
most
sensible
and
*NL*
proper
plans
for
giving
them
pleasure
,
they
would
have
been
using
*NL*
the
same
interval
of
time
to
discover
some
misdeed
that
I
had
already
*NL*
forgotten
,
and
would
begin
to
scold
me
severely
,
just
as
I
flung
myself
*NL*
upon
them
with
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
to
the
exhilaration
which
I
derived
from
being
alone
would
be
*NL*
added
an
alternative
feeling
,
so
that
I
could
not
be
clear
in
my
mind
to
*NL*
which
I
should
give
the
casting
vote
;
a
feeling
stimulated
by
the
desire
*NL*
to
see
rise
up
before
my
eyes
a
peasant-girl
whom
I
might
clasp
in
my
*NL*
arms
.
Coming
abruptly
,
and
without
giving
me
time
to
trace
it
accurately
*NL*
to
its
source
among
so
many
ideas
of
a
very
different
kind
,
the
pleasure
*NL*
which
accompanied
this
desire
seemed
only
a
degree
superior
to
what
was
*NL*
given
me
by
my
other
thoughts
.
I
found
an
additional
merit
in
everything
*NL*
that
was
in
my
mind
at
the
moment
,
in
the
pink
reflection
of
the
tiled
*NL*
roof
,
the
wild
grass
in
the
wall
,
the
village
of
Roussainville
into
*NL*
which
I
had
long
desired
to
penetrate
,
the
trees
of
its
wood
and
the
*NL*
steeple
of
its
church
,
created
in
them
by
this
fresh
emotion
which
made
*NL*
them
appear
more
desirable
only
because
I
thought
it
was
they
that
*NL*
had
provoked
it
,
and
which
seemed
only
to
wish
to
bear
me
more
swiftly
*NL*
towards
them
when
it
filled
my
sails
with
a
potent
,
unknown
,
and
*NL*
propitious
breeze
.
But
if
this
desire
that
a
woman
should
appear
added
*NL*
for
me
something
more
exalting
than
the
charms
of
nature
,
they
in
their
*NL*
turn
enlarged
what
I
might
,
in
the
woman
's
charm
,
have
found
too
much
*NL*
restricted
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
the
beauty
of
the
trees
was
hers
*NL*
also
,
and
that
,
as
for
the
spirit
of
those
horizons
,
of
the
village
of
*NL*
Roussainville
,
of
the
books
which
I
was
reading
that
year
,
it
was
her
*NL*
kiss
which
would
make
me
master
of
them
all
;
and
,
my
imagination
drawing
*NL*
strength
from
contact
with
my
sensuality
,
my
sensuality
expanding
*NL*
through
all
the
realms
of
my
imagination
,
my
desire
had
no
longer
any
*NL*
bounds
.
Moreover
--
just
as
in
moments
of
musing
contemplation
of
nature
,
*NL*
the
normal
actions
of
the
mind
being
suspended
,
and
our
abstract
ideas
*NL*
of
things
set
on
one
side
,
we
believe
with
the
profoundest
faith
in
the
*NL*
originality
,
in
the
individual
existence
of
the
place
in
which
we
may
*NL*
happen
to
be
--
the
passing
figure
which
my
desire
evoked
seemed
to
be
*NL*
not
any
one
example
of
the
general
type
of
`
woman
,
'
but
a
necessary
and
*NL*
natural
product
of
the
soil
.
For
at
that
time
everything
which
was
not
*NL*
myself
,
the
earth
and
the
creatures
upon
it
,
seemed
to
me
more
precious
,
*NL*
more
important
,
endowed
with
a
more
real
existence
than
they
appear
*NL*
to
full-grown
men
.
And
between
the
earth
and
its
creatures
I
made
*NL*
no
distinction
.
I
had
a
desire
for
a
peasant-girl
from
M√©s√©glise
or
*NL*
Roussainville
,
for
a
fisher-girl
from
Balbec
,
just
as
I
had
a
desire
for
*NL*
Balbec
and
M√©s√©glise
.
The
pleasure
which
those
girls
were
empowered
to
*NL*
give
me
would
have
seemed
less
genuine
,
I
should
have
had
no
faith
in
*NL*
it
any
longer
,
if
I
had
been
at
liberty
to
modify
its
conditions
as
I
*NL*
chose
.
To
meet
in
Paris
a
fisher-girl
from
Balbec
or
a
peasant-girl
from
*NL*
M√©s√©glise
would
have
been
like
receiving
the
present
of
a
shell
which
*NL*
I
had
never
seen
upon
the
beach
,
or
of
a
fern
which
I
had
never
found
*NL*
among
the
woods
,
would
have
stripped
from
the
pleasure
which
she
was
*NL*
about
to
give
me
all
those
other
pleasures
in
the
thick
of
which
my
*NL*
imagination
had
enwrapped
her
.
But
to
wander
thus
among
the
woods
of
*NL*
Roussainville
without
a
peasant-girl
to
embrace
was
to
see
those
woods
*NL*
and
yet
know
nothing
of
their
secret
treasure
,
their
deep-hidden
beauty
.
*NL*
That
girl
whom
I
never
saw
save
dappled
with
the
shadows
of
their
*NL*
leaves
,
was
to
me
herself
a
plant
of
local
growth
,
only
taller
than
the
*NL*
rest
,
and
one
whose
structure
would
enable
me
to
approach
more
closely
*NL*
than
in
them
to
the
intimate
savour
of
the
land
from
which
she
had
*NL*
sprung
.
I
could
believe
this
all
the
more
readily
-LRB-
and
also
that
*NL*
the
caresses
by
which
she
would
bring
that
savour
to
my
senses
were
*NL*
themselves
of
a
particular
kind
,
yielding
a
pleasure
which
I
could
*NL*
never
derive
from
any
but
herself
-RRB-
since
I
was
still
,
and
must
for
long
*NL*
remain
,
in
that
period
of
life
when
one
has
not
yet
separated
the
fact
*NL*
of
this
sensual
pleasure
from
the
various
women
in
whose
company
one
has
*NL*
tasted
it
,
when
one
has
not
reduced
it
to
a
general
idea
which
makes
one
*NL*
regard
them
thenceforward
as
the
variable
instruments
of
a
pleasure
that
*NL*
is
always
the
same
.
Indeed
,
that
pleasure
does
not
exist
,
isolated
and
*NL*
formulated
in
the
consciousness
,
as
the
ultimate
object
with
which
one
*NL*
seeks
a
woman
's
company
,
or
as
the
cause
of
the
uneasiness
which
,
in
*NL*
anticipation
,
one
then
feels
.
Hardly
even
does
one
think
of
oneself
,
*NL*
but
only
how
to
escape
from
oneself
.
Obscurely
awaited
,
immanent
and
*NL*
concealed
,
it
rouses
to
such
a
paroxysm
,
at
the
moment
when
at
last
it
*NL*
makes
itself
felt
,
those
other
pleasures
which
we
find
in
the
tender
*NL*
glance
,
in
the
kiss
of
her
who
is
by
our
side
,
that
it
seems
to
us
,
more
*NL*
than
anything
else
,
a
sort
of
transport
of
gratitude
for
the
kindness
of
*NL*
heart
of
our
companion
and
for
her
touching
predilection
of
ourselves
,
*NL*
which
we
measure
by
the
benefits
,
by
the
happiness
that
she
showers
upon
*NL*
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
,
it
was
in
vain
that
I
implored
the
dungeon-keep
of
Roussainville
,
*NL*
that
I
begged
it
to
send
out
to
meet
me
some
daughter
of
its
village
,
*NL*
appealing
to
it
as
to
the
sole
confidant
to
whom
I
had
disclosed
my
*NL*
earliest
desire
when
,
from
the
top
floor
of
our
house
at
Combray
,
from
*NL*
the
little
room
that
smelt
of
orris-root
,
I
had
peered
out
and
seen
*NL*
nothing
but
its
tower
,
framed
in
the
square
of
the
half-opened
window
,
*NL*
while
,
with
the
heroic
scruples
of
a
traveller
setting
forth
for
*NL*
unknown
climes
,
or
of
a
desperate
wretch
hesitating
on
the
verge
of
*NL*
self-destruction
,
faint
with
emotion
,
I
explored
,
across
the
bounds
of
*NL*
my
own
experience
,
an
untrodden
path
which
,
I
believed
,
might
lead
me
to
*NL*
my
death
,
even
--
until
passion
spent
itself
and
left
me
shuddering
among
*NL*
the
sprays
of
flowering
currant
which
,
creeping
in
through
the
window
,
*NL*
tumbled
all
about
my
body
.
In
vain
I
called
upon
it
now
.
In
vain
I
*NL*
compressed
the
whole
landscape
into
my
field
of
vision
,
draining
it
with
*NL*
an
exhaustive
gaze
which
sought
to
extract
from
it
a
female
creature
.
I
*NL*
might
go
alone
as
far
as
the
porch
of
Saint-Andr√©-des-Champs
:
never
did
*NL*
I
find
there
the
girl
whom
I
should
inevitably
have
met
,
had
I
been
with
*NL*
my
grandfather
,
and
so
unable
to
engage
her
in
conversation
.
I
would
fix
*NL*
my
eyes
,
without
limit
of
time
,
upon
the
trunk
of
a
distant
tree
,
from
*NL*
behind
which
she
must
appear
and
spring
towards
me
;
my
closest
scrutiny
*NL*
left
the
horizon
barren
as
before
;
night
was
falling
;
without
any
hope
*NL*
now
would
I
concentrate
my
attention
,
as
though
to
force
up
out
of
it
*NL*
the
creatures
which
it
must
conceal
,
upon
that
sterile
soil
,
that
stale
*NL*
and
outworn
land
;
and
it
was
no
longer
in
lightness
of
heart
,
but
with
*NL*
sullen
anger
that
I
aimed
blows
at
the
trees
of
Roussainville
wood
,
from
*NL*
among
which
no
more
living
creatures
made
their
appearance
than
if
they
*NL*
had
been
trees
painted
on
the
stretched
canvas
background
of
a
panorama
,
*NL*
when
,
unable
to
resign
myself
to
having
to
return
home
without
having
*NL*
held
in
my
arms
the
woman
I
so
greatly
desired
,
I
was
yet
obliged
to
*NL*
retrace
my
steps
towards
Combray
,
and
to
admit
to
myself
that
the
chance
*NL*
of
her
appearing
in
my
path
grew
smaller
every
moment
.
And
if
she
had
*NL*
appeared
,
would
I
have
dared
to
speak
to
her
?
I
felt
that
she
would
have
*NL*
regarded
me
as
mad
,
for
I
no
longer
thought
of
those
desires
which
came
*NL*
to
me
on
my
walks
,
but
were
never
realized
,
as
being
shared
by
others
,
*NL*
or
as
having
any
existence
apart
from
myself
.
They
seemed
nothing
more
*NL*
now
than
the
purely
subjective
,
impotent
,
illusory
creatures
of
my
*NL*
temperament
.
They
were
in
no
way
connected
now
with
nature
,
with
the
*NL*
world
of
real
things
,
which
from
now
onwards
lost
all
its
charm
and
*NL*
significance
,
and
meant
no
more
to
my
life
than
a
purely
conventional
*NL*
framework
,
just
as
the
action
of
a
novel
is
framed
in
the
railway
*NL*
carriage
,
on
a
seat
of
which
a
traveller
is
reading
it
to
pass
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
is
perhaps
from
another
impression
which
I
received
at
*NL*
Mont-jouvain
,
some
years
later
,
an
impression
which
at
that
time
was
*NL*
without
meaning
,
that
there
arose
,
long
afterwards
,
my
idea
of
that
*NL*
cruel
side
of
human
passion
called
`
sadism
.
'
We
shall
see
,
in
due
*NL*
course
,
that
for
quite
another
reason
the
memory
of
this
impression
was
*NL*
to
play
an
important
part
in
my
life
.
It
was
during
a
spell
of
very
hot
*NL*
weather
;
my
parents
,
who
had
been
obliged
to
go
away
for
the
whole
day
,
*NL*
had
told
me
that
I
might
stay
out
as
late
as
I
pleased
;
and
having
*NL*
gone
as
far
as
the
Montjouvain
pond
,
where
I
enjoyed
seeing
again
the
*NL*
reflection
of
the
tiled
roof
of
the
hut
,
I
had
lain
down
in
the
shade
*NL*
and
gone
to
sleep
among
the
bushes
on
the
steep
slope
that
rose
up
*NL*
behind
the
house
,
just
where
I
had
waited
for
my
parents
,
years
before
,
*NL*
one
day
when
they
had
gone
to
call
on
M.
Vinteuil
.
It
was
almost
dark
*NL*
when
I
awoke
,
and
I
wished
to
rise
and
go
away
,
but
I
saw
Mlle.
Vinteuil
*NL*
-LRB-
or
thought
,
at
least
,
that
I
recognised
her
,
for
I
had
not
seen
her
*NL*
often
at
Combray
,
and
then
only
when
she
was
still
a
child
,
whereas
*NL*
she
was
now
growing
into
a
young
woman
-RRB-
,
who
probably
had
just
come
in
,
*NL*
standing
in
front
of
me
,
and
only
a
few
feet
away
from
me
,
in
that
room
*NL*
in
which
her
father
had
entertained
mine
,
and
which
she
had
now
made
*NL*
into
a
little
sitting-room
for
herself
.
The
window
was
partly
open
;
the
*NL*
lamp
was
lighted
;
I
could
watch
her
every
movement
without
her
being
*NL*
able
to
see
me
;
but
,
had
I
gone
away
,
I
must
have
made
a
rustling
sound
*NL*
among
the
bushes
,
she
would
have
heard
me
,
and
might
have
thought
that
I
*NL*
had
been
hiding
there
in
order
to
spy
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
deep
mourning
,
for
her
father
had
but
lately
died
.
We
had
*NL*
not
gone
to
see
her
;
my
mother
had
not
cared
to
go
,
on
account
of
that
*NL*
virtue
which
alone
in
her
fixed
any
bounds
to
her
benevolence
--
namely
,
*NL*
modesty
;
but
she
pitied
the
girl
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
.
My
*NL*
mother
had
not
forgotten
the
sad
end
of
M.
Vinteuil
's
life
,
his
complete
*NL*
absorption
,
first
in
having
to
play
both
mother
and
nursery-maid
to
his
*NL*
daughter
,
and
,
later
,
in
the
suffering
which
she
had
caused
him
;
she
*NL*
could
see
the
tortured
expression
which
was
never
absent
from
the
old
*NL*
man
's
face
in
those
terrible
last
years
;
she
knew
that
he
had
definitely
*NL*
abandoned
the
task
of
transcribing
in
fair
copies
the
whole
of
his
later
*NL*
work
,
the
poor
little
pieces
,
we
imagined
,
of
an
old
music-master
,
a
*NL*
retired
village
organist
,
which
,
we
assumed
,
were
of
little
or
no
value
*NL*
in
themselves
,
though
we
did
not
despise
them
,
because
they
were
of
such
*NL*
great
value
to
him
and
had
been
the
chief
motive
of
his
life
before
he
*NL*
sacrificed
them
to
his
daughter
;
pieces
which
,
being
mostly
not
even
*NL*
written
down
,
but
recorded
only
in
his
memory
,
while
the
rest
were
*NL*
scribbled
on
loose
sheets
of
paper
,
and
quite
illegible
,
must
now
remain
*NL*
unknown
for
ever
;
my
mother
thought
,
also
,
of
that
other
and
still
more
*NL*
cruel
renunciation
to
which
M.
Vinteuil
had
been
driven
,
that
of
seeing
*NL*
the
girl
happily
settled
,
with
an
honest
and
respectable
future
;
when
*NL*
she
called
to
mind
all
this
utter
and
crushing
misery
that
had
come
*NL*
upon
my
aunts
'
old
music-master
,
she
was
moved
to
very
real
grief
,
and
*NL*
shuddered
to
think
of
that
other
grief
,
so
different
in
its
bitterness
,
*NL*
which
Mlle.
Vinteuil
must
now
be
feeling
,
tinged
with
remorse
at
having
*NL*
virtually
killed
her
father
.
``
Poor
M.
Vinteuil
,
''
my
mother
would
say
,
*NL*
``
he
lived
for
his
daughter
,
and
now
he
has
died
for
her
,
without
getting
*NL*
his
reward
.
Will
he
get
it
now
,
I
wonder
,
and
in
what
form
?
It
can
only
*NL*
come
to
him
from
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
far
end
of
Mlle.
Vinteuil
's
sitting-room
,
on
the
mantelpiece
,
*NL*
stood
a
small
photograph
of
her
father
which
she
went
briskly
to
fetch
,
*NL*
just
as
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
was
heard
from
the
road
outside
,
*NL*
then
flung
herself
down
on
a
sofa
and
drew
close
beside
her
a
little
*NL*
table
on
which
she
placed
the
photograph
,
just
as
,
long
ago
,
M.
Vinteuil
*NL*
had
`
placed
'
beside
him
the
piece
of
music
which
he
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
play
over
to
my
parents
.
And
then
her
friend
came
in
.
Mlle.
Vinteuil
*NL*
greeted
her
without
rising
,
clasping
her
hands
behind
her
head
,
and
*NL*
drew
her
body
to
one
side
of
the
sofa
,
as
though
to
`
make
room
.
'
But
no
*NL*
sooner
had
she
done
this
than
she
appeared
to
feel
that
she
was
perhaps
*NL*
suggesting
a
particular
position
to
her
friend
,
with
an
emphasis
which
*NL*
might
well
be
regarded
as
importunate
.
She
thought
that
her
friend
would
*NL*
prefer
,
no
doubt
,
to
sit
down
at
some
distance
from
her
,
upon
a
chair
;
*NL*
she
felt
that
she
had
been
indiscreet
;
her
sensitive
heart
took
fright
;
*NL*
stretching
herself
out
again
over
the
whole
of
the
sofa
,
she
closed
her
*NL*
eyes
and
began
to
yawn
,
so
as
to
indicate
that
it
was
a
desire
to
sleep
,
*NL*
and
that
alone
,
which
had
made
her
lie
down
there
.
Despite
the
rude
*NL*
and
hectoring
familiarity
with
which
she
treated
her
companion
I
could
*NL*
recognise
in
her
the
obsequious
and
reticent
advances
,
the
abrupt
*NL*
scruples
and
restraints
which
had
characterised
her
father
.
Presently
*NL*
she
rose
and
came
to
the
window
,
where
she
pretended
to
be
trying
to
*NL*
close
the
shutters
and
not
succeeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
them
open
,
''
said
her
friend
.
``
I
am
hot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
too
dreadful
!
People
will
see
us
,
''
Mlle.
Vinteuil
answered
.
*NL*
And
then
she
guessed
,
probably
,
that
her
friend
would
think
that
she
had
*NL*
uttered
these
words
simply
in
order
to
provoke
a
reply
in
certain
other
*NL*
words
,
which
she
seemed
,
indeed
,
to
wish
to
hear
spoken
,
but
,
from
*NL*
prudence
,
would
let
her
friend
be
the
first
to
speak
.
And
so
,
although
*NL*
I
could
not
see
her
face
clearly
enough
,
I
am
sure
that
the
expression
*NL*
must
have
appeared
on
it
which
my
grandmother
had
once
found
so
*NL*
delightful
,
when
she
hastily
went
on
:
``
When
I
say
`
see
us
'
I
mean
,
of
*NL*
course
,
see
us
reading
.
It
's
so
dreadful
to
think
that
in
every
trivial
*NL*
little
thing
you
do
some
one
may
be
overlooking
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
instinctive
generosity
of
her
nature
,
a
courtesy
beyond
her
*NL*
control
,
she
refrained
from
uttering
the
studied
words
which
,
she
had
*NL*
felt
,
were
indispensable
for
the
full
realisation
of
her
desire
.
And
*NL*
perpetually
,
in
the
depths
of
her
being
,
a
shy
and
suppliant
maiden
*NL*
would
kneel
before
that
other
element
,
the
old
campaigner
,
battered
but
*NL*
triumphant
,
would
intercede
with
him
and
oblige
him
to
retire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
it
is
so
extremely
likely
that
people
are
looking
at
us
at
*NL*
this
time
of
night
in
this
densely
populated
district
!
''
said
her
friend
,
*NL*
with
bitter
irony
.
``
And
what
if
they
are
?
''
she
went
on
,
feeling
bound
*NL*
to
annotate
with
a
malicious
yet
affectionate
wink
these
words
which
*NL*
she
was
repeating
,
out
of
good
nature
,
like
a
lesson
prepared
beforehand
*NL*
which
,
she
knew
,
it
would
please
Mlle.
Vinteuil
to
hear
.
``
And
what
if
*NL*
they
are
?
All
the
better
that
they
should
see
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mlle.
Vinteuil
shuddered
and
rose
to
her
feet
.
In
her
sensitive
*NL*
and
scrupulous
heart
she
was
ignorant
what
words
ought
to
flow
,
*NL*
spontaneously
,
from
her
lips
,
so
as
to
produce
the
scene
for
which
her
*NL*
eager
senses
clamoured
.
She
reached
out
as
far
as
she
could
across
the
*NL*
limitations
of
her
true
character
to
find
the
language
appropriate
to
*NL*
a
vicious
young
woman
such
as
she
longed
to
be
thought
,
but
the
*NL*
words
which
,
she
imagined
,
such
a
young
woman
might
have
uttered
with
*NL*
sincerity
sounded
unreal
in
her
own
mouth
.
And
what
little
she
allowed
*NL*
herself
to
say
was
said
in
a
strained
tone
,
in
which
her
ingrained
*NL*
timidity
paralysed
her
tendency
to
freedom
and
audacity
of
speech
;
while
*NL*
she
kept
on
interrupting
herself
with
:
``
You
're
sure
you
are
n't
cold
?
You
*NL*
are
n't
too
hot
?
You
do
n't
want
to
sit
and
read
by
yourself
?
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
ladyship
's
thoughts
seem
to
be
rather
`
warm
'
this
evening
,
''
she
*NL*
concluded
,
doubtless
repeating
a
phrase
which
she
had
heard
used
,
on
*NL*
some
earlier
occasion
,
by
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
V-shaped
opening
of
her
crape
bodice
Mlle.
Vinteuil
felt
the
*NL*
sting
of
her
friend
's
sudden
kiss
;
she
gave
a
little
scream
and
*NL*
ran
away
;
and
then
they
began
to
chase
one
another
about
the
room
,
*NL*
scrambling
over
the
furniture
,
their
wide
sleeves
fluttering
like
*NL*
wings
,
clucking
and
crowing
like
a
pair
of
amorous
fowls
.
At
last
Mlle.
*NL*
Vinteuil
fell
down
exhausted
upon
the
sofa
,
where
she
was
screened
from
*NL*
me
by
the
stooping
body
of
her
friend
.
But
the
latter
now
had
her
back
*NL*
turned
to
the
little
table
on
which
the
old
music-master
's
portrait
had
*NL*
been
arranged
.
Mlle.
Vinteuil
realised
that
her
friend
would
not
see
*NL*
it
unless
her
attention
were
drawn
to
it
,
and
so
exclaimed
,
as
if
she
*NL*
herself
had
just
noticed
it
for
the
first
time
:
``
Oh
!
there
's
my
father
's
*NL*
picture
looking
at
us
;
I
ca
n't
think
who
can
have
put
it
there
;
I
'm
sure
*NL*
I
've
told
them
twenty
times
,
that
is
not
the
proper
place
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
remembered
the
words
that
M.
Vinteuil
had
used
to
my
parents
in
*NL*
apologising
for
an
obtrusive
sheet
of
music
.
This
photograph
was
,
of
*NL*
course
,
in
common
use
in
their
ritual
observances
,
was
subjected
to
*NL*
daily
profanation
,
for
the
friend
replied
in
words
which
were
evidently
*NL*
a
liturgical
response
:
``
Let
him
stay
there
.
He
ca
n't
trouble
us
any
*NL*
longer
.
D'you
think
he
'd
start
whining
,
d'you
think
he
'd
pack
you
out
*NL*
of
the
house
if
he
could
see
you
now
,
with
the
window
open
,
the
ugly
old
*NL*
monkey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Mlle.
Vinteuil
replied
,
``
Oh
,
please
!
''
--
a
gentle
reproach
*NL*
which
testified
to
the
genuine
goodness
of
her
nature
,
not
that
it
*NL*
was
prompted
by
any
resentment
at
hearing
her
father
spoken
of
in
this
*NL*
fashion
-LRB-
for
that
was
evidently
a
feeling
which
she
had
trained
herself
,
*NL*
by
a
long
course
of
sophistries
,
to
keep
in
close
subjection
at
such
*NL*
moments
-RRB-
,
but
rather
because
it
was
the
bridle
which
,
so
as
to
avoid
all
*NL*
appearance
of
egotism
,
she
herself
used
to
curb
the
gratification
which
*NL*
her
friend
was
attempting
to
procure
for
her
.
It
may
well
have
been
,
*NL*
too
,
that
the
smiling
moderation
with
which
she
faced
and
answered
these
*NL*
blasphemies
,
that
this
tender
and
hypocritical
rebuke
appeared
to
her
*NL*
frank
and
generous
nature
as
a
particularly
shameful
and
seductive
form
*NL*
of
that
criminal
attitude
towards
life
which
she
was
endeavouring
to
*NL*
adopt
.
But
she
could
not
resist
the
attraction
of
being
treated
with
*NL*
affection
by
a
woman
who
had
just
shewn
herself
so
implacable
towards
*NL*
the
defenceless
dead
;
she
sprang
on
to
the
knees
of
her
friend
and
held
*NL*
out
a
chaste
brow
to
be
kissed
;
precisely
as
a
daughter
would
have
done
*NL*
to
her
mother
,
feeling
with
exquisite
joy
that
they
would
thus
,
between
*NL*
them
,
inflict
the
last
turn
of
the
screw
of
cruelty
,
in
robbing
M.
*NL*
Vinteuil
,
as
though
they
were
actually
rifling
his
tomb
,
of
the
sacred
*NL*
rights
of
fatherhood
.
Her
friend
took
the
girl
's
head
in
her
hands
and
*NL*
placed
a
kiss
on
her
brow
with
a
docility
prompted
by
the
real
affection
*NL*
she
had
for
Mlle.
Vinteuil
,
as
well
as
by
the
desire
to
bring
what
*NL*
distraction
she
could
into
the
dull
and
melancholy
life
of
an
orphan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
I
should
like
to
do
to
that
old
horror
?
''
she
said
,
*NL*
taking
up
the
photograph
.
She
murmured
in
Mlle.
Vinteuil
's
ear
something
*NL*
that
I
could
not
distinguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
You
would
never
dare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
dare
to
spit
on
it
?
On
that
?
''
shouted
the
friend
with
deliberate
*NL*
brutality
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
no
more
,
for
Mlle.
Vinteuil
,
who
now
seemed
weary
,
awkward
,
*NL*
preoccupied
,
sincere
,
and
rather
sad
,
came
back
to
the
window
and
drew
*NL*
the
shutters
close
;
but
I
knew
now
what
was
the
reward
that
M.
Vinteuil
,
*NL*
in
return
for
all
the
suffering
that
he
had
endured
in
his
lifetime
,
on
*NL*
account
of
his
daughter
,
had
received
from
her
after
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
I
have
since
reflected
that
if
M.
Vinteuil
had
been
able
to
be
*NL*
present
at
this
scene
,
he
might
still
,
and
in
spite
of
everything
,
have
*NL*
continued
to
believe
in
his
daughter
's
soundness
of
heart
,
and
that
he
*NL*
might
even
,
in
so
doing
,
have
been
not
altogether
wrong
.
It
was
true
*NL*
that
in
all
Mlle.
Vinteuil
's
actions
the
appearance
of
evil
was
so
*NL*
strong
and
so
consistent
that
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
it
*NL*
exhibited
in
such
completeness
save
in
what
is
nowadays
called
a
*NL*
`
sadist
'
;
it
is
behind
the
footlights
of
a
Paris
theatre
,
and
not
under
*NL*
the
homely
lamp
of
an
actual
country
house
,
that
one
expects
to
see
a
*NL*
girl
leading
her
friend
on
to
spit
upon
the
portrait
of
a
father
who
has
*NL*
lived
and
died
for
nothing
and
no
one
but
herself
;
and
when
we
find
in
*NL*
real
life
a
desire
for
melodramatic
effect
,
it
is
generally
the
`
sadic
'
*NL*
instinct
that
is
responsible
for
it
.
It
is
possible
that
,
without
being
*NL*
in
the
least
inclined
towards
`
sadism
,
'
a
girl
might
have
shewn
the
*NL*
same
outrageous
cruelty
as
Mlle.
Vinteuil
in
desecrating
the
memory
and
*NL*
defying
the
wishes
of
her
dead
father
,
but
she
would
not
have
given
them
*NL*
deliberate
expression
in
an
act
so
crude
in
its
symbolism
,
so
lacking
*NL*
in
subtlety
;
the
criminal
element
in
her
behaviour
would
have
been
less
*NL*
evident
to
other
people
,
and
even
to
herself
,
since
she
would
not
have
*NL*
admitted
to
herself
that
she
was
doing
wrong
.
But
,
appearances
apart
,
in
*NL*
Mlle.
Vinteuil
's
soul
,
at
least
in
the
earlier
stages
,
the
evil
element
*NL*
was
probably
not
unmixed
.
A
`
sadist
'
of
her
kind
is
an
artist
in
evil
,
*NL*
which
a
wholly
wicked
person
could
not
be
,
for
in
that
case
the
evil
*NL*
would
not
have
been
external
,
it
would
have
seemed
quite
natural
to
her
,
*NL*
and
would
not
even
have
been
distinguishable
from
herself
;
and
as
for
*NL*
virtue
,
respect
for
the
dead
,
filial
obedience
,
since
she
would
never
*NL*
have
practised
the
cult
of
these
things
,
she
would
take
no
impious
*NL*
delight
in
their
profanation
.
`
Sadists
'
of
Mlle.
Vinteuil
's
sort
are
*NL*
creatures
so
purely
sentimental
,
so
virtuous
by
nature
,
that
even
*NL*
sensual
pleasure
appears
to
them
as
something
bad
,
a
privilege
reserved
*NL*
for
the
wicked
.
And
when
they
allow
themselves
for
a
moment
to
enjoy
it
*NL*
they
endeavour
to
impersonate
,
to
assume
all
the
outward
appearance
of
*NL*
wicked
people
,
for
themselves
and
their
partners
in
guilt
,
so
as
to
gain
*NL*
the
momentary
illusion
of
having
escaped
beyond
the
control
of
their
own
*NL*
gentle
and
scrupulous
natures
into
the
inhuman
world
of
pleasure
.
And
*NL*
I
could
understand
how
she
must
have
longed
for
such
an
escape
when
I
*NL*
realised
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
effect
it
.
At
the
moment
when
*NL*
she
wished
to
be
thought
the
very
antithesis
of
her
father
,
what
she
at
*NL*
once
suggested
to
me
were
the
mannerisms
,
in
thought
and
speech
,
of
*NL*
the
poor
old
music-master
.
Indeed
,
his
photograph
was
nothing
;
what
she
*NL*
really
desecrated
,
what
she
corrupted
into
ministering
to
her
pleasures
,
*NL*
but
what
remained
between
them
and
her
and
prevented
her
from
any
*NL*
direct
enjoyment
of
them
,
was
the
likeness
between
her
face
and
his
,
his
*NL*
mother
's
blue
eyes
which
he
had
handed
down
to
her
,
like
some
trinket
to
*NL*
be
kept
in
the
family
,
those
little
friendly
movements
and
inclinations
*NL*
which
set
up
between
the
viciousness
of
Mlle.
Vinteuil
and
herself
a
*NL*
phraseology
,
a
mentality
not
designed
for
vice
,
which
made
her
regard
it
*NL*
as
not
in
any
way
different
from
the
numberless
little
social
duties
and
*NL*
courtesies
to
which
she
must
devote
herself
every
day
.
It
was
not
evil
*NL*
that
gave
her
the
idea
of
pleasure
,
that
seemed
to
her
attractive
;
it
*NL*
was
pleasure
,
rather
,
that
seemed
evil
.
And
as
,
every
time
that
she
*NL*
indulged
in
it
,
pleasure
came
to
her
attended
by
evil
thoughts
such
as
,
*NL*
ordinarily
,
had
no
place
in
her
virtuous
mind
,
she
came
at
length
to
*NL*
see
in
pleasure
itself
something
diabolical
,
to
identify
it
with
Evil
.
*NL*
Perhaps
Mlle.
Vinteuil
felt
that
at
heart
her
friend
was
not
altogether
*NL*
bad
,
not
really
sincere
when
she
gave
vent
to
those
blasphemous
*NL*
utterances
.
At
any
rate
,
she
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
those
kisses
*NL*
on
her
brow
,
those
smiles
,
those
glances
;
all
feigned
,
perhaps
,
but
akin
*NL*
in
their
base
and
vicious
mode
of
expression
to
those
which
would
have
*NL*
been
discernible
on
the
face
of
a
creature
formed
not
out
of
kindness
*NL*
and
long-suffering
,
but
out
of
self-indulgence
and
cruelty
.
She
was
*NL*
able
to
delude
herself
for
a
moment
into
believing
that
she
was
indeed
*NL*
amusing
herself
in
the
way
in
which
,
with
so
unnatural
an
accomplice
,
a
*NL*
girl
might
amuse
herself
who
really
did
experience
that
savage
antipathy
*NL*
towards
her
father
's
memory
.
Perhaps
she
would
not
have
thought
of
*NL*
wickedness
as
a
state
so
rare
,
so
abnormal
,
so
exotic
,
one
which
it
was
*NL*
so
refreshing
to
visit
,
had
she
been
able
to
distinguish
in
herself
,
*NL*
as
in
all
her
fellow-men
and
women
,
that
indifference
to
the
sufferings
*NL*
which
they
cause
which
,
whatever
names
else
be
given
it
,
is
the
one
*NL*
true
,
terrible
and
lasting
form
of
cruelty
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
'
was
so
easy
,
it
was
a
very
different
matter
when
*NL*
we
took
the
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
for
that
meant
a
long
walk
,
and
we
must
*NL*
make
sure
,
first
,
of
the
weather
.
When
we
seemed
to
have
entered
upon
a
*NL*
spell
of
fine
days
,
when
Fran√ßoise
,
in
desperation
that
not
a
drop
was
*NL*
falling
upon
the
`
poor
crops
,
'
gazing
up
at
the
sky
and
seeing
there
*NL*
only
a
little
white
cloud
floating
here
and
there
upon
its
calm
,
azure
*NL*
surface
,
groaned
aloud
and
exclaimed
:
``
You
would
say
they
were
nothing
*NL*
more
nor
less
than
a
lot
of
dogfish
swimming
about
and
sticking
up
their
*NL*
snouts
!
Ah
,
they
never
think
of
making
it
rain
a
little
for
the
poor
*NL*
labourers
!
And
then
when
the
corn
is
all
ripe
,
down
it
will
come
,
*NL*
rattling
all
over
the
place
,
and
think
no
more
of
where
it
is
falling
*NL*
than
if
it
was
on
the
sea
!
''
--
when
my
father
's
appeals
to
the
gardener
*NL*
had
met
with
the
same
encouraging
answer
several
times
in
succession
,
*NL*
then
some
one
would
say
,
at
dinner
:
``
To-morrow
,
if
the
weather
holds
,
*NL*
we
might
go
the
Guermantes
way
.
''
And
off
we
would
set
,
immediately
after
*NL*
luncheon
,
through
the
little
garden
gate
which
dropped
us
into
the
Rue
*NL*
des
Perchamps
,
narrow
and
bent
at
a
sharp
angle
,
dotted
with
grass-plots
*NL*
over
which
two
or
three
wasps
would
spend
the
day
botanising
,
a
street
*NL*
as
quaint
as
its
name
,
from
which
its
odd
characteristics
and
its
*NL*
personality
were
,
I
felt
,
derived
;
a
street
for
which
one
might
search
*NL*
in
vain
through
the
Combray
of
to-day
,
for
the
public
school
now
rises
*NL*
upon
its
site
.
But
in
my
dreams
of
Combray
-LRB-
like
those
architects
,
*NL*
pupils
of
Viollet-le-Duc
,
who
,
fancying
that
they
can
detect
,
beneath
*NL*
a
Renaissance
rood-loft
and
an
eighteenth-century
altar
,
traces
of
a
*NL*
Norman
choir
,
restore
the
whole
church
to
the
state
in
which
it
probably
*NL*
was
in
the
twelfth
century
-RRB-
I
leave
not
a
stone
of
the
modern
edifice
*NL*
standing
,
I
pierce
through
it
and
`
restore
'
the
Rue
des
Perchamps
.
And
*NL*
for
such
reconstruction
memory
furnishes
me
with
more
detailed
guidance
*NL*
than
is
generally
at
the
disposal
of
restorers
;
the
pictures
which
it
*NL*
has
preserved
--
perhaps
the
last
surviving
in
the
world
to-day
,
and
soon
*NL*
to
follow
the
rest
into
oblivion
--
of
what
Combray
looked
like
in
my
*NL*
childhood
's
days
;
pictures
which
,
simply
because
it
was
the
old
Combray
*NL*
that
traced
their
outlines
upon
my
mind
before
it
vanished
,
are
as
*NL*
moving
--
if
I
may
compare
a
humble
landscape
with
those
glorious
works
,
*NL*
reproductions
of
which
my
grandmother
was
so
fond
of
bestowing
on
me
--
as
*NL*
those
old
engravings
of
the
`
Cenacolo
,
'
or
that
painting
by
Gentile
*NL*
Bellini
,
in
which
one
sees
,
in
a
state
in
which
they
no
longer
exist
,
*NL*
the
masterpiece
of
Leonardo
and
the
portico
of
Saint
Mark
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
would
pass
,
in
the
Rue
de
l'Oiseau
,
before
the
old
hostelry
of
the
*NL*
Oiseau
Flesch√©
,
into
whose
great
courtyard
,
once
upon
a
time
,
would
*NL*
rumble
the
coaches
of
the
Duchesses
de
Montpensier
,
de
Guermantes
,
*NL*
and
de
Montmorency
,
when
they
had
to
come
down
to
Combray
for
some
*NL*
litigation
with
their
farmers
,
or
to
receive
homage
from
them
.
We
would
*NL*
come
at
length
to
the
Mall
,
among
whose
treetops
I
could
distinguish
the
*NL*
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
.
And
I
should
have
liked
to
be
able
to
sit
down
*NL*
and
spend
the
whole
day
there
,
reading
and
listening
to
the
bells
,
for
*NL*
it
was
so
charming
there
and
so
quiet
that
,
when
an
hour
struck
,
you
*NL*
would
have
said
not
that
it
broke
in
upon
the
calm
of
the
day
,
but
that
*NL*
it
relieved
the
day
of
its
superfluity
,
and
that
the
steeple
,
with
the
*NL*
indolent
,
painstaking
exactitude
of
a
person
who
has
nothing
else
to
do
,
*NL*
had
simply
,
in
order
to
squeeze
out
and
let
fall
the
few
golden
drops
*NL*
which
had
slowly
and
naturally
accumulated
in
the
hot
sunlight
,
pressed
,
*NL*
at
a
given
moment
,
the
distended
surface
of
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
charm
of
the
`
Guermantes
'
way
was
that
we
had
beside
us
,
*NL*
almost
all
the
time
,
the
course
of
the
Vivonne
.
We
crossed
it
first
,
ten
*NL*
minutes
after
leaving
the
house
,
by
a
foot-bridge
called
the
Pont-Vieux
.
*NL*
And
every
year
,
when
we
arrived
at
Combray
,
on
Easter
morning
,
after
the
*NL*
sermon
,
if
the
weather
was
fine
,
I
would
run
there
to
see
-LRB-
amid
all
the
*NL*
disorder
that
prevails
on
the
morning
of
a
great
festival
,
the
gorgeous
*NL*
preparations
for
which
make
the
everyday
household
utensils
that
they
*NL*
have
not
contrived
to
banish
seem
more
sordid
than
ever
-RRB-
the
river
*NL*
flowing
past
,
sky-blue
already
between
banks
still
black
and
bare
,
its
*NL*
only
companions
a
clump
of
daffodils
,
come
out
before
their
time
,
a
few
*NL*
primroses
,
the
first
in
flower
,
while
here
and
there
burned
the
blue
*NL*
flame
of
a
violet
,
its
stem
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
the
drop
of
*NL*
perfume
stored
in
its
tiny
horn
.
The
Pont-Vieux
led
to
a
tow-path
which
,
*NL*
at
this
point
,
would
be
overhung
in
summer
by
the
bluish
foliage
of
a
*NL*
hazel
,
under
which
a
fisherman
in
a
straw
hat
seemed
to
have
taken
*NL*
root
.
At
Combray
,
where
I
knew
everyone
,
and
could
always
detect
the
*NL*
blacksmith
or
grocer
's
boy
through
his
disguise
of
a
beadle
's
uniform
*NL*
or
chorister
's
surplice
,
this
fisherman
was
the
only
person
whom
I
was
*NL*
never
able
to
identify
.
He
must
have
known
my
family
,
for
he
used
to
*NL*
raise
his
hat
when
we
passed
;
and
then
I
would
always
be
just
on
the
*NL*
point
of
asking
his
name
,
when
some
one
would
make
a
sign
to
me
to
be
*NL*
quiet
,
or
I
would
frighten
the
fish
.
We
would
follow
the
tow-path
which
*NL*
ran
along
the
top
of
a
steep
bank
,
several
feet
above
the
stream
.
The
*NL*
ground
on
the
other
side
was
lower
,
and
stretched
in
a
series
of
broad
*NL*
meadows
as
far
as
the
village
and
even
to
the
distant
railway-station
.
*NL*
Over
these
were
strewn
the
remains
,
half-buried
in
the
long
grass
,
of
*NL*
the
castle
of
the
old
Counts
of
Combray
,
who
,
during
the
Middle
Ages
,
*NL*
had
had
on
this
side
the
course
of
the
Vivonne
as
a
barrier
and
defence
*NL*
against
attack
from
the
Lords
of
Guermantes
and
Abbots
of
Martinville
.
*NL*
Nothing
was
left
now
but
a
few
stumps
of
towers
,
hummocks
upon
the
broad
*NL*
surface
of
the
fields
,
hardly
visible
,
broken
battlements
over
which
,
in
*NL*
their
day
,
the
bowmen
had
hurled
down
stones
,
the
watchmen
had
gazed
out
*NL*
over
Novepont
,
Clairefontaine
,
Martinville-le-Sec
,
Bailleau-l'Exempt
,
*NL*
fiefs
all
of
them
of
Guermantes
,
a
ring
in
which
Combray
was
locked
;
*NL*
but
fallen
among
the
grass
now
,
levelled
with
the
ground
,
climbed
and
*NL*
commanded
by
boys
from
the
Christian
Brothers
'
school
,
who
came
there
*NL*
in
their
playtime
,
or
with
lesson-books
to
be
conned
;
emblems
of
a
past
*NL*
that
had
sunk
down
and
well-nigh
vanished
under
the
earth
,
that
lay
by
*NL*
the
water
's
edge
now
,
like
an
idler
taking
the
air
,
yet
giving
me
strong
*NL*
food
for
thought
,
making
the
name
of
Combray
connote
to
me
not
the
*NL*
little
town
of
to-day
only
,
but
an
historic
city
vastly
different
,
*NL*
seizing
and
holding
my
imagination
by
the
remote
,
incomprehensible
*NL*
features
which
it
half-concealed
beneath
a
spangled
veil
of
buttercups
.
*NL*
For
the
buttercups
grew
past
numbering
on
this
spot
which
they
had
*NL*
chosen
for
their
games
among
the
grass
,
standing
singly
,
in
couples
,
in
*NL*
whole
companies
,
yellow
as
the
yolk
of
eggs
,
and
glowing
with
an
added
*NL*
lustre
,
I
felt
,
because
,
being
powerless
to
consummate
with
my
palate
*NL*
the
pleasure
which
the
sight
of
them
never
failed
to
give
me
,
I
would
*NL*
let
it
accumulate
as
my
eyes
ranged
over
their
gilded
expanse
,
until
*NL*
it
had
acquired
the
strength
to
create
in
my
mind
a
fresh
example
of
*NL*
absolute
,
unproductive
beauty
;
and
so
it
had
been
from
my
earliest
*NL*
childhood
,
when
from
the
tow-path
I
had
stretched
out
my
arms
towards
*NL*
them
,
before
even
I
could
pronounce
their
charming
name
--
a
name
fit
for
*NL*
the
Prince
in
some
French
fairy-tale
;
colonists
,
perhaps
,
in
some
far
*NL*
distant
century
from
Asia
,
but
naturalised
now
for
ever
in
the
village
,
*NL*
well
satisfied
with
their
modest
horizon
,
rejoicing
in
the
sunshine
*NL*
and
the
water
's
edge
,
faithful
to
their
little
glimpse
of
the
*NL*
railway-station
;
yet
keeping
,
none
the
less
,
as
do
some
of
our
old
*NL*
paintings
,
in
their
plebeian
simplicity
,
a
poetic
scintillation
from
the
*NL*
golden
East
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
amuse
myself
by
watching
the
glass
jars
which
the
boys
used
*NL*
to
lower
into
the
Vivonne
,
to
catch
minnows
,
and
which
,
filled
by
the
*NL*
current
of
the
stream
,
in
which
they
themselves
also
were
enclosed
,
at
*NL*
once
`
containers
'
whose
transparent
sides
were
like
solidified
water
*NL*
and
`
contents
'
plunged
into
a
still
larger
container
of
liquid
,
*NL*
flowing
crystal
,
suggested
an
image
of
coolness
more
delicious
and
more
*NL*
provoking
than
the
same
water
in
the
same
jars
would
have
done
,
standing
*NL*
upon
a
table
laid
for
dinner
,
by
shewing
it
as
perpetually
in
flight
*NL*
between
the
impalpable
water
,
in
which
my
hands
could
not
arrest
it
,
and
*NL*
the
insoluble
glass
,
in
which
my
palate
could
not
enjoy
it
.
I
decided
*NL*
that
I
would
come
there
again
with
a
line
and
catch
fish
;
I
begged
for
*NL*
and
obtained
a
morsel
of
bread
from
our
luncheon
basket
;
and
threw
into
*NL*
the
Vivonne
pellets
which
had
the
power
,
it
seemed
,
to
bring
about
a
*NL*
chemical
precipitation
,
for
the
water
at
once
grew
solid
round
about
*NL*
them
in
oval
clusters
of
emaciated
tadpoles
,
which
until
then
it
had
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
been
holding
in
solution
,
invisible
,
but
ready
and
alert
to
enter
*NL*
the
stage
of
crystallisation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
course
of
the
Vivonne
became
choked
with
water-plants
.
*NL*
At
first
they
appeared
singly
,
a
lily
,
for
instance
,
which
the
current
,
*NL*
across
whose
path
it
had
unfortunately
grown
,
would
never
leave
at
rest
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
so
that
,
like
a
ferry-boat
mechanically
propelled
,
it
*NL*
would
drift
over
to
one
bank
only
to
return
to
the
other
,
eternally
*NL*
repeating
its
double
journey
.
Thrust
towards
the
bank
,
its
stalk
would
*NL*
be
straightened
out
,
lengthened
,
strained
almost
to
breaking-point
until
*NL*
the
current
again
caught
it
,
its
green
moorings
swung
back
over
their
*NL*
anchorage
and
brought
the
unhappy
plant
to
what
might
fitly
be
called
*NL*
its
starting-point
,
since
it
was
fated
not
to
rest
there
a
moment
before
*NL*
moving
off
once
again
.
I
would
still
find
it
there
,
on
one
walk
after
*NL*
another
,
always
in
the
same
helpless
state
,
suggesting
certain
victims
*NL*
of
neurasthenia
,
among
whom
my
grandfather
would
have
included
my
aunt
*NL*
L√©onie
,
who
present
without
modification
,
year
after
year
,
the
spectacle
*NL*
of
their
odd
and
unaccountable
habits
,
which
they
always
imagine
*NL*
themselves
to
be
on
the
point
of
shaking
off
,
but
which
they
always
*NL*
retain
to
the
end
;
caught
in
the
treadmill
of
their
own
maladies
and
*NL*
eccentricities
,
their
futile
endeavours
to
escape
serve
only
to
actuate
*NL*
its
mechanism
,
to
keep
in
motion
the
clockwork
of
their
strange
,
*NL*
ineluctable
,
fatal
daily
round
.
Such
as
these
was
the
water-lily
,
*NL*
and
also
like
one
of
those
wretches
whose
peculiar
torments
,
repeated
*NL*
indefinitely
throughout
eternity
,
aroused
the
curiosity
of
Dante
,
who
*NL*
would
have
inquired
of
them
at
greater
length
and
in
fuller
detail
from
*NL*
the
victims
themselves
,
had
not
Virgil
,
striding
on
ahead
,
obliged
him
*NL*
to
hasten
after
him
at
full
speed
,
as
I
must
hasten
after
my
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
farther
on
the
current
slackened
,
where
the
stream
ran
through
a
*NL*
property
thrown
open
to
the
public
by
its
owner
,
who
had
made
a
hobby
of
*NL*
aquatic
gardening
,
so
that
the
little
ponds
into
which
the
Vivonne
was
*NL*
here
diverted
were
aflower
with
water-lilies
.
As
the
banks
at
this
*NL*
point
were
thickly
wooded
,
the
heavy
shade
of
the
trees
gave
the
water
a
*NL*
background
which
was
ordinarily
dark
green
,
although
sometimes
,
when
we
*NL*
were
coming
home
on
a
calm
evening
after
a
stormy
afternoon
,
I
have
seen
*NL*
in
its
depths
a
clear
,
crude
blue
that
was
almost
violet
,
suggesting
a
*NL*
floor
of
Japanese
cloisonn√©
.
Here
and
there
,
on
the
surface
,
floated
,
*NL*
blushing
like
a
strawberry
,
the
scarlet
heart
of
a
lily
set
in
a
ring
of
*NL*
white
petals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
these
the
flowers
were
more
frequent
,
but
paler
,
less
glossy
,
*NL*
more
thickly
seeded
,
more
tightly
folded
,
and
disposed
,
by
accident
,
in
*NL*
festoons
so
graceful
that
I
would
fancy
I
saw
floating
upon
the
stream
,
*NL*
as
though
after
the
dreary
stripping
of
the
decorations
used
in
some
*NL*
Watteau
festival
,
moss-roses
in
loosened
garlands
.
Elsewhere
a
corner
*NL*
seemed
to
be
reserved
for
the
commoner
kinds
of
lily
;
of
a
neat
pink
or
*NL*
white
like
rocket-flowers
,
washed
clean
like
porcelain
,
with
housewifely
*NL*
care
;
while
,
a
little
farther
again
,
were
others
,
pressed
close
together
*NL*
in
a
floating
garden-bed
,
as
though
pansies
had
flown
out
of
a
garden
*NL*
like
butterflies
and
were
hovering
with
blue
and
burnished
wings
over
*NL*
the
transparent
shadowiness
of
this
watery
border
;
this
skiey
border
*NL*
also
,
for
it
set
beneath
the
flowers
a
soil
of
a
colour
more
precious
,
*NL*
more
moving
than
their
own
;
and
both
in
the
afternoon
,
when
it
sparkled
*NL*
beneath
the
lilies
in
the
kaleidoscope
of
a
happiness
silent
,
restless
,
*NL*
and
alert
,
and
towards
evening
,
when
it
was
filled
like
a
distant
heaven
*NL*
with
the
roseate
dreams
of
the
setting
sun
,
incessantly
changing
and
*NL*
ever
remaining
in
harmony
,
about
the
more
permanent
colour
of
the
*NL*
flowers
themselves
,
with
the
utmost
profundity
,
evanescence
,
and
*NL*
mystery
--
with
a
quiet
suggestion
of
infinity
;
afternoon
or
evening
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
have
set
them
flowering
in
the
heart
of
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
leaving
this
park
the
Vivonne
began
to
flow
again
more
swiftly
.
*NL*
How
often
have
I
watched
,
and
longed
to
imitate
,
when
I
should
be
free
*NL*
to
live
as
I
chose
,
a
rower
who
had
shipped
his
oars
and
lay
stretched
*NL*
out
on
his
back
,
his
head
down
,
in
the
bottom
of
his
boat
,
letting
it
*NL*
drift
with
the
current
,
seeing
nothing
but
the
sky
which
slipped
quietly
*NL*
above
him
,
shewing
upon
his
features
a
foretaste
of
happiness
and
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
would
sit
down
among
the
irises
at
the
water
's
edge
.
In
the
holiday
*NL*
sky
a
lazy
cloud
streamed
out
to
its
full
length
.
Now
and
then
,
crushed
*NL*
by
the
burden
of
idleness
,
a
carp
would
heave
up
out
of
the
water
,
with
*NL*
an
anxious
gasp
.
It
was
time
for
us
to
feed
.
Before
starting
homewards
*NL*
we
would
sit
for
a
long
time
there
,
eating
fruit
and
bread
and
*NL*
chocolate
,
on
the
grass
,
over
which
came
to
our
ears
,
horizontal
,
faint
,
*NL*
but
solid
still
and
metallic
,
the
sound
of
the
bells
of
Saint-Hilaire
,
*NL*
which
had
melted
not
at
all
in
the
atmosphere
it
was
so
well
accustomed
*NL*
to
traverse
,
but
,
broken
piecemeal
by
the
successive
palpitation
of
all
*NL*
their
sonorous
strokes
,
throbbed
as
it
brushed
the
flowers
at
our
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
at
the
water
's
edge
and
embedded
in
trees
,
we
would
come
upon
*NL*
a
house
of
the
kind
called
`
pleasure
houses
,
'
isolated
and
lost
,
seeing
*NL*
nothing
of
the
world
,
save
the
river
which
bathed
its
feet
.
A
young
*NL*
woman
,
whose
pensive
face
and
fashionable
veils
did
not
suggest
a
local
*NL*
origin
,
and
who
had
doubtless
come
there
,
in
the
popular
phrase
,
`
to
*NL*
bury
herself
,
'
to
taste
the
bitter
sweetness
of
feeling
that
her
name
,
*NL*
and
still
more
the
name
of
him
whose
heart
she
had
once
held
,
but
had
*NL*
been
unable
to
keep
,
were
unknown
there
,
stood
framed
in
a
window
from
*NL*
which
she
had
no
outlook
beyond
the
boat
that
was
moored
beside
her
*NL*
door
.
She
raised
her
eyes
with
an
air
of
distraction
when
she
heard
,
*NL*
through
the
trees
that
lined
the
bank
,
the
voices
of
passers-by
of
whom
,
*NL*
before
they
came
in
sight
,
she
might
be
certain
that
never
had
they
*NL*
known
,
nor
would
they
know
,
the
faithless
lover
,
that
nothing
in
their
*NL*
past
lives
bore
his
imprint
,
which
nothing
in
their
future
would
have
*NL*
occasion
to
receive
.
One
felt
that
in
her
renunciation
of
life
she
had
*NL*
willingly
abandoned
those
places
in
which
she
would
at
least
have
been
*NL*
able
to
see
him
whom
she
loved
,
for
others
where
he
had
never
trod
.
And
*NL*
I
watched
her
,
as
she
returned
from
some
walk
along
a
road
where
she
had
*NL*
known
that
he
would
not
appear
,
drawing
from
her
submissive
fingers
long
*NL*
gloves
of
a
precious
,
useless
charm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
,
in
the
course
of
our
walks
along
the
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
might
*NL*
we
penetrate
as
far
as
the
source
of
the
Vivonne
,
of
which
I
had
often
*NL*
thought
,
which
had
in
my
mind
so
abstract
,
so
ideal
an
existence
,
that
I
*NL*
had
been
as
much
surprised
when
some
one
told
me
that
it
was
actually
*NL*
to
be
found
in
the
same
department
,
and
at
a
given
number
of
miles
from
*NL*
Combray
,
as
I
had
been
on
the
day
when
I
had
learned
that
there
was
*NL*
another
fixed
point
somewhere
on
the
earth
's
surface
,
where
,
according
*NL*
to
the
ancients
,
opened
the
jaws
of
Hell
.
Nor
could
we
ever
reach
that
*NL*
other
goal
,
to
which
I
longed
so
much
to
attain
,
Guermantes
itself
.
I
*NL*
knew
that
it
was
the
residence
of
its
proprietors
,
the
Duc
and
Duchesse
*NL*
de
Guermantes
,
I
knew
that
they
were
real
personages
who
did
actually
*NL*
exist
,
but
whenever
I
thought
about
them
I
pictured
them
to
myself
*NL*
either
in
tapestry
,
as
was
the
`
Coronation
of
Esther
'
which
hung
in
our
*NL*
church
,
or
else
in
changing
,
rainbow
colours
,
as
was
Gilbert
the
Bad
in
*NL*
his
window
,
where
he
passed
from
cabbage
green
,
when
I
was
dipping
my
*NL*
fingers
in
the
holy
water
stoup
,
to
plum
blue
when
I
had
reached
our
row
*NL*
of
chairs
,
or
again
altogether
impalpable
,
like
the
image
of
Genevi√®ve
*NL*
de
Brabant
,
ancestress
of
the
Guermantes
family
,
which
the
magic
lantern
*NL*
sent
wandering
over
the
curtains
of
my
room
or
flung
aloft
upon
the
*NL*
ceiling
--
in
short
,
always
wrapped
in
the
mystery
of
the
Merovingian
age
,
*NL*
and
bathed
,
as
in
a
sunset
,
in
the
orange
light
which
glowed
from
the
*NL*
resounding
syllable
`
antes
.
'
And
if
,
in
spite
of
that
,
they
were
for
*NL*
me
,
in
their
capacity
as
a
duke
and
a
duchess
,
real
people
,
though
of
*NL*
an
unfamiliar
kind
,
this
ducal
personality
was
in
its
turn
enormously
*NL*
distended
,
immaterialised
,
so
as
to
encircle
and
contain
that
Guermantes
*NL*
of
which
they
were
duke
and
duchess
,
all
that
sunlit
`
Guermantes
way
'
*NL*
of
our
walks
,
the
course
of
the
Vivonne
,
its
water-lilies
and
its
*NL*
overshadowing
trees
,
and
an
endless
series
of
hot
summer
afternoons
.
*NL*
And
I
knew
that
they
bore
not
only
the
titles
of
Duc
and
Duchesse
de
*NL*
Guermantes
,
but
that
since
the
fourteenth
century
,
when
,
after
vain
*NL*
attempts
to
conquer
its
earlier
lords
in
battle
,
they
had
allied
*NL*
themselves
by
marriage
,
and
so
became
Counts
of
Combray
,
the
first
*NL*
citizens
,
consequently
,
of
the
place
,
and
yet
the
only
ones
among
*NL*
its
citizens
who
did
not
reside
in
it
--
Comtes
de
Combray
,
possessing
*NL*
Combray
,
threading
it
on
their
string
of
names
and
titles
,
absorbing
it
*NL*
in
their
personalities
,
and
illustrating
,
no
doubt
,
in
themselves
that
*NL*
strange
and
pious
melancholy
which
was
peculiar
to
Combray
;
proprietors
*NL*
of
the
town
,
though
not
of
any
particular
house
there
;
dwelling
,
*NL*
presumably
,
out
of
doors
,
in
the
street
,
between
heaven
and
earth
,
like
*NL*
that
Gilbert
de
Guermantes
,
of
whom
I
could
see
,
in
the
stained
glass
of
*NL*
the
apse
of
Saint-Hilaire
,
only
the
`
other
side
'
in
dull
black
lacquer
,
*NL*
if
I
raised
my
eyes
to
look
for
him
,
when
I
was
going
to
Camus
's
for
a
*NL*
packet
of
salt
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
it
happened
that
,
going
the
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
I
passed
*NL*
occasionally
by
a
row
of
well-watered
little
gardens
,
over
whose
hedges
*NL*
rose
clusters
of
dark
blossom
.
I
would
stop
before
them
,
hoping
to
gain
*NL*
some
precious
addition
to
my
experience
,
for
I
seemed
to
have
before
my
*NL*
eyes
a
fragment
of
that
riverside
country
which
I
had
longed
so
much
*NL*
to
see
and
know
since
coming
upon
a
description
of
it
by
one
of
my
*NL*
favourite
authors
.
And
it
was
with
that
story-book
land
,
with
its
*NL*
imagined
soil
intersected
by
a
hundred
bubbling
watercourses
,
that
*NL*
Guermantes
,
changing
its
form
in
my
mind
,
became
identified
,
after
I
*NL*
heard
Dr.
Percepied
speak
of
the
flowers
and
the
charming
rivulets
and
*NL*
fountains
that
were
to
be
seen
there
in
the
ducal
park
.
I
used
to
dream
*NL*
that
Mme.
de
Guermantes
,
taking
a
sudden
capricious
fancy
for
myself
,
*NL*
invited
me
there
,
that
all
day
long
she
stood
fishing
for
trout
by
my
*NL*
side
.
And
when
evening
came
,
holding
my
hand
in
her
own
,
as
we
passed
by
*NL*
the
little
gardens
of
her
vassals
,
she
would
point
out
to
me
the
flowers
*NL*
that
leaned
their
red
and
purple
spikes
along
the
tops
of
the
low
walls
,
*NL*
and
would
teach
me
all
their
names
.
She
would
make
me
tell
her
,
too
,
all
*NL*
about
the
poems
that
I
meant
to
compose
.
And
these
dreams
reminded
me
*NL*
that
,
since
I
wished
,
some
day
,
to
become
a
writer
,
it
was
high
time
to
*NL*
decide
what
sort
of
books
I
was
going
to
write
.
But
as
soon
as
I
asked
*NL*
myself
the
question
,
and
tried
to
discover
some
subjects
to
which
I
*NL*
could
impart
a
philosophical
significance
of
infinite
value
,
my
mind
*NL*
would
stop
like
a
clock
,
I
would
see
before
me
vacuity
,
nothing
,
would
*NL*
feel
either
that
I
was
wholly
devoid
of
talent
,
or
that
,
perhaps
,
a
*NL*
malady
of
the
brain
was
hindering
its
development
.
Sometimes
I
would
*NL*
depend
upon
my
father
's
arranging
everything
for
me
.
He
was
so
powerful
,
*NL*
in
such
favour
with
the
people
who
`
really
counted
,
'
that
he
made
it
*NL*
possible
for
us
to
transgress
laws
which
Fran√ßoise
had
taught
me
to
*NL*
regard
as
more
ineluctable
than
the
laws
of
life
and
death
,
as
when
we
*NL*
were
allowed
to
postpone
for
a
year
the
compulsory
repainting
of
the
*NL*
walls
of
our
house
,
alone
among
all
the
houses
in
that
part
of
Paris
,
*NL*
or
when
he
obtained
permission
from
the
Minister
for
Mme.
Sazerat
's
*NL*
son
,
who
had
been
ordered
to
some
watering-place
,
to
take
his
degree
two
*NL*
months
before
the
proper
time
,
among
the
candidates
whose
surnames
began
*NL*
with
`
A
,
'
instead
of
having
to
wait
his
turn
as
an
'S
.
'
If
I
had
fallen
*NL*
seriously
ill
,
if
I
had
been
captured
by
brigands
,
convinced
that
my
*NL*
father
's
understanding
with
the
supreme
powers
was
too
complete
,
that
*NL*
his
letters
of
introduction
to
the
Almighty
were
too
irresistible
for
my
*NL*
illness
or
captivity
to
turn
out
anything
but
vain
illusions
,
in
which
*NL*
there
was
no
danger
actually
threatening
me
,
I
should
have
awaited
*NL*
with
perfect
composure
the
inevitable
hour
of
my
return
to
comfortable
*NL*
realities
,
of
my
deliverance
from
bondage
or
restoration
to
health
.
*NL*
Perhaps
this
want
of
talent
,
this
black
cavity
which
gaped
in
my
mind
*NL*
when
I
ransacked
it
for
the
theme
of
my
future
writings
,
was
itself
no
*NL*
more
,
either
,
than
an
unsubstantial
illusion
,
and
would
be
brought
to
*NL*
an
end
by
the
intervention
of
my
father
,
who
would
arrange
with
the
*NL*
Government
and
with
Providence
that
I
should
be
the
first
writer
of
*NL*
my
day
.
But
at
other
times
,
while
my
parents
were
growing
impatient
*NL*
at
seeing
me
loiter
behind
instead
of
following
them
,
my
actual
life
,
*NL*
instead
of
seeming
an
artificial
creation
by
my
father
,
and
one
which
he
*NL*
could
modify
as
he
chose
,
appeared
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
be
comprised
in
*NL*
a
larger
reality
which
had
not
been
created
for
my
benefit
,
from
whose
*NL*
judgments
there
was
no
appeal
,
in
the
heart
of
which
I
was
bound
,
*NL*
helpless
,
without
friend
or
ally
,
and
beyond
which
no
further
*NL*
possibilities
lay
concealed
.
It
was
evident
to
me
then
that
I
existed
in
*NL*
the
same
manner
as
all
other
men
,
that
I
must
grow
old
,
that
I
must
die
*NL*
like
them
,
and
that
among
them
I
was
to
be
distinguished
merely
as
one
*NL*
of
those
who
have
no
aptitude
for
writing
.
And
so
,
utterly
despondent
,
I
*NL*
renounced
literature
for
ever
,
despite
the
encouragements
that
had
been
*NL*
given
me
by
Bloch
.
This
intimate
,
spontaneous
feeling
,
this
sense
of
the
*NL*
nullity
of
my
intellect
,
prevailed
against
all
the
flattering
speeches
*NL*
that
might
be
lavished
upon
me
,
as
a
wicked
man
,
when
everyone
is
loud
*NL*
in
the
praise
of
his
good
deeds
,
is
gnawed
by
the
secret
remorse
of
*NL*
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
my
mother
said
:
``
You
are
always
talking
about
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
.
Well
,
Dr.
Percepied
did
a
great
deal
for
her
when
she
was
*NL*
ill
,
four
years
ago
,
and
so
she
is
coming
to
Combray
for
his
daughter
's
*NL*
wedding
.
You
will
be
able
to
see
her
in
church
.
''
It
was
from
Dr.
*NL*
Percepied
,
as
it
happened
,
that
I
had
heard
most
about
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
,
and
he
had
even
shewn
us
the
number
of
an
illustrated
paper
*NL*
in
which
she
was
depicted
in
the
costume
which
she
had
worn
at
a
fancy
*NL*
dress
ball
given
by
the
Princesse
de
L√©on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
during
the
nuptial
mass
,
the
beadle
,
by
moving
to
one
side
,
*NL*
enabled
me
to
see
,
sitting
in
a
chapel
,
a
lady
with
fair
hair
and
a
*NL*
large
nose
,
piercing
blue
eyes
,
a
billowy
scarf
of
mauve
silk
,
glossy
*NL*
and
new
and
brilliant
,
and
a
little
spot
at
the
corner
of
her
nose
.
And
*NL*
because
on
the
surface
of
her
face
,
which
was
red
,
as
though
she
had
*NL*
been
very
warm
,
I
could
make
out
,
diluted
and
barely
perceptible
,
*NL*
details
which
resembled
the
portrait
that
had
been
shewn
to
me
;
because
,
*NL*
more
especially
,
the
particular
features
which
I
remarked
in
this
lady
,
*NL*
if
I
attempted
to
catalogue
them
,
formulated
themselves
in
precisely
the
*NL*
same
terms
:
--
_
a
large
nose
,
blue
eyes
_
,
as
Dr.
Percepied
had
used
when
*NL*
describing
in
my
presence
the
Duchesse
de
Guermantes
,
I
said
to
myself
:
*NL*
``
This
lady
is
like
the
Duchesse
de
Guermantes
.
''
Now
the
chapel
from
*NL*
which
she
was
following
the
service
was
that
of
Gilbert
the
Bad
;
beneath
*NL*
its
flat
tombstones
,
yellowed
and
bulging
like
cells
of
honey
in
a
comb
,
*NL*
rested
the
bones
of
the
old
Counts
of
Brabant
;
and
I
remembered
having
*NL*
heard
it
said
that
this
chapel
was
reserved
for
the
Guermantes
family
,
*NL*
whenever
any
of
its
members
came
to
attend
a
ceremony
at
Combray
;
there
*NL*
was
,
indeed
,
but
one
woman
resembling
the
portrait
of
Mme.
de
Guermantes
*NL*
who
on
that
day
,
the
very
day
on
which
she
was
expected
to
come
there
,
*NL*
could
be
sitting
in
that
chapel
:
it
was
she
!
My
disappointment
was
*NL*
immense
.
It
arose
from
my
not
having
borne
in
mind
,
when
I
thought
of
*NL*
Mme.
de
Guermantes
,
that
I
was
picturing
her
to
myself
in
the
colours
of
*NL*
a
tapestry
or
a
painted
window
,
as
living
in
another
century
,
as
being
*NL*
of
another
substance
than
the
rest
of
the
human
race
.
Never
had
I
taken
*NL*
into
account
that
she
might
have
a
red
face
,
a
mauve
scarf
like
Mme.
*NL*
Sazerat
;
and
the
oval
curve
of
her
cheeks
reminded
me
so
strongly
of
*NL*
people
whom
I
had
seen
at
home
that
the
suspicion
brushed
against
my
*NL*
mind
-LRB-
though
it
was
immediately
banished
-RRB-
that
this
lady
in
her
creative
*NL*
principle
,
in
the
molecules
of
her
physical
composition
,
was
perhaps
*NL*
not
substantially
the
Duchesse
de
Guermantes
,
but
that
her
body
,
in
*NL*
ignorance
of
the
name
that
people
had
given
it
,
belonged
to
a
certain
*NL*
type
of
femininity
which
included
,
also
,
the
wives
of
doctors
and
*NL*
tradesmen
.
``
It
is
,
it
must
be
Mme.
de
Guermantes
,
and
no
one
else
!
''
were
*NL*
the
words
underlying
the
attentive
and
astonished
expression
with
*NL*
which
I
was
gazing
upon
this
image
,
which
,
naturally
enough
,
bore
no
*NL*
resemblance
to
those
that
had
so
often
,
under
the
same
title
of
`
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
,
'
appeared
to
me
in
dreams
,
since
this
one
had
not
been
,
like
*NL*
the
others
,
formed
arbitrarily
by
myself
,
but
had
sprung
into
sight
for
*NL*
the
first
time
,
only
a
moment
ago
,
here
in
church
;
an
image
which
was
*NL*
not
of
the
same
nature
,
was
not
colourable
at
will
,
like
those
others
*NL*
that
allowed
themselves
to
imbibe
the
orange
tint
of
a
sonorous
*NL*
syllable
,
but
which
was
so
real
that
everything
,
even
to
the
fiery
*NL*
little
spot
at
the
corner
of
her
nose
,
gave
an
assurance
of
her
*NL*
subjection
to
the
laws
of
life
,
as
in
a
transformation
scene
on
the
*NL*
stage
a
crease
in
the
dress
of
a
fairy
,
a
quivering
of
her
tiny
finger
,
*NL*
indicate
the
material
presence
of
a
living
actress
before
our
eyes
,
*NL*
whereas
we
were
uncertain
,
till
then
,
whether
we
were
not
looking
merely
*NL*
at
a
projection
of
limelight
from
a
lantern
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
I
was
endeavouring
to
apply
to
this
image
,
which
the
prominent
*NL*
nose
,
the
piercing
eyes
pinned
down
and
fixed
in
my
field
of
vision
*NL*
-LRB-
perhaps
because
it
was
they
that
had
first
struck
it
,
that
had
made
the
*NL*
first
impression
on
its
surface
,
before
I
had
had
time
to
wonder
*NL*
whether
the
woman
who
thus
appeared
before
me
might
possibly
be
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
-RRB-
,
to
this
fresh
and
unchanging
image
the
idea
:
``
It
is
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
''
;
but
I
succeeded
only
in
making
the
idea
pass
between
me
and
*NL*
the
image
,
as
though
they
were
two
discs
moving
in
separate
planes
,
*NL*
with
a
space
between
.
But
this
Mme.
de
Guermantes
of
whom
I
had
so
often
*NL*
dreamed
,
now
that
I
could
see
that
she
had
a
real
existence
independent
*NL*
of
myself
,
acquired
a
fresh
increase
of
power
over
my
imagination
,
*NL*
which
,
paralysed
for
a
moment
by
contact
with
a
reality
so
different
*NL*
from
anything
that
it
had
expected
,
began
to
react
and
to
say
within
me
:
*NL*
``
Great
and
glorious
before
the
days
of
Charlemagne
,
the
Guermantes
*NL*
had
the
right
of
life
and
death
over
their
vassals
;
the
Duchesse
de
*NL*
Guermantes
descends
from
Genevi√®ve
de
Brabant
.
She
does
not
know
,
nor
*NL*
would
she
consent
to
know
,
any
of
the
people
who
are
here
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
--
oh
,
marvellous
independence
of
the
human
gaze
,
tied
to
the
*NL*
human
face
by
a
cord
so
loose
,
so
long
,
so
elastic
that
it
can
stray
,
*NL*
alone
,
as
far
as
it
may
choose
--
while
Mme.
de
Guermantes
sat
in
the
*NL*
chapel
above
the
tombs
of
her
dead
ancestors
,
her
gaze
lingered
here
*NL*
and
wandered
there
,
rose
to
the
capitals
of
the
pillars
,
and
even
rested
*NL*
upon
myself
,
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
straying
down
the
nave
,
but
a
ray
*NL*
of
sunlight
which
,
at
the
moment
when
I
received
its
caress
,
appeared
*NL*
conscious
of
where
it
fell
.
As
for
Mme.
de
Guermantes
herself
,
since
*NL*
she
remained
there
motionless
,
sitting
like
a
mother
who
affects
not
to
*NL*
notice
the
rude
or
awkward
conduct
of
her
children
who
,
in
the
course
*NL*
of
their
play
,
are
speaking
to
people
whom
she
does
not
know
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
me
to
determine
whether
she
approved
or
condemned
the
*NL*
vagrancy
of
her
eyes
in
the
careless
detachment
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
it
to
be
important
that
she
should
not
leave
the
church
before
*NL*
I
had
been
able
to
look
long
enough
upon
her
,
reminding
myself
that
for
*NL*
years
past
I
had
regarded
the
sight
of
her
as
a
thing
eminently
to
be
*NL*
desired
,
and
I
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
her
,
as
though
by
gazing
at
her
*NL*
I
should
be
able
to
carry
away
and
incorporate
,
to
store
up
,
for
later
*NL*
reference
,
in
myself
the
memory
of
that
prominent
nose
,
those
red
*NL*
cheeks
,
of
all
those
details
which
struck
me
as
so
much
precious
,
*NL*
authentic
,
unparalleled
information
with
regard
to
her
face
.
And
now
*NL*
that
,
whenever
I
brought
my
mind
to
bear
upon
that
face
--
and
*NL*
especially
,
perhaps
,
in
my
determination
,
that
form
of
the
instinct
*NL*
of
self-preservation
with
which
we
guard
everything
that
is
best
in
*NL*
ourselves
,
not
to
admit
that
I
had
been
in
any
way
deceived
--
I
found
*NL*
only
beauty
there
;
setting
her
once
again
-LRB-
since
they
were
one
and
the
*NL*
same
person
,
this
lady
who
sat
before
me
and
that
Duchesse
de
Guermantes
*NL*
whom
,
until
then
,
I
had
been
used
to
conjure
into
an
imagined
shape
-RRB-
*NL*
apart
from
and
above
that
common
run
of
humanity
with
which
the
sight
,
*NL*
pure
and
simple
,
of
her
in
the
flesh
had
made
me
for
a
moment
confound
*NL*
her
,
I
grew
indignant
when
I
heard
people
saying
,
in
the
congregation
*NL*
round
me
:
``
She
is
better
looking
than
Mme.
Sazerat
''
or
``
than
Mlle.
*NL*
Vinteuil
,
''
as
though
she
had
been
in
any
way
comparable
with
them
.
And
*NL*
my
gaze
resting
upon
her
fair
hair
,
her
blue
eyes
,
the
lines
of
her
*NL*
neck
,
and
overlooking
the
features
which
might
have
reminded
me
of
*NL*
the
faces
of
other
women
,
I
cried
out
within
myself
,
as
I
admired
this
*NL*
deliberately
unfinished
sketch
:
``
How
lovely
she
is
!
What
true
nobility
!
*NL*
it
is
indeed
a
proud
Guermantes
,
the
descendant
of
Genevi√®ve
de
Brabant
,
*NL*
that
I
have
before
me
!
''
And
the
care
which
I
took
to
focus
all
my
*NL*
attention
upon
her
face
succeeded
in
isolating
it
so
completely
that
*NL*
to-day
,
when
I
call
that
marriage
ceremony
to
mind
,
I
find
it
impossible
*NL*
to
visualise
any
single
person
who
was
present
except
her
,
and
the
*NL*
beadle
who
answered
me
in
the
affirmative
when
I
inquired
whether
the
*NL*
lady
was
,
indeed
,
Mme.
de
Guermantes
.
But
her
,
I
can
see
her
still
quite
*NL*
clearly
,
especially
at
the
moment
when
the
procession
filed
into
the
*NL*
sacristy
,
lighted
by
the
intermittent
,
hot
sunshine
of
a
windy
and
rainy
*NL*
day
,
where
Mme.
de
Guermantes
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
all
*NL*
those
Combray
people
whose
names
,
even
,
she
did
not
know
,
but
whose
*NL*
inferiority
proclaimed
her
own
supremacy
so
loud
that
she
must
,
in
*NL*
return
,
feel
for
them
a
genuine
,
pitying
sympathy
,
and
whom
she
might
*NL*
count
on
impressing
even
more
forcibly
by
virtue
of
her
simplicity
and
*NL*
natural
charm
.
And
then
,
too
,
since
she
could
not
bring
into
play
the
*NL*
deliberate
glances
,
charged
with
a
definite
meaning
,
which
one
directs
,
*NL*
in
a
crowd
,
towards
people
whom
one
knows
,
but
must
allow
her
vague
*NL*
thoughts
to
escape
continually
from
her
eyes
in
a
flood
of
blue
light
*NL*
which
she
was
powerless
to
control
,
she
was
anxious
not
to
distress
in
*NL*
any
way
,
not
to
seem
to
be
despising
those
humbler
mortals
over
whom
*NL*
that
current
flowed
,
by
whom
it
was
everywhere
arrested
.
I
can
see
*NL*
again
to-day
,
above
her
mauve
scarf
,
silky
and
buoyant
,
the
gentle
*NL*
astonishment
in
her
eyes
,
to
which
she
had
added
,
without
daring
to
*NL*
address
it
to
anyone
in
particular
,
but
so
that
everyone
might
enjoy
his
*NL*
share
of
it
,
the
almost
timid
smile
of
a
sovereign
lady
who
seems
to
*NL*
be
making
an
apology
for
her
presence
among
the
vassals
whom
she
loves
.
*NL*
This
smile
rested
upon
myself
,
who
had
never
ceased
to
follow
her
with
*NL*
my
eyes
.
And
I
,
remembering
the
glance
which
she
had
let
fall
upon
me
*NL*
during
the
service
,
blue
as
a
ray
of
sunlight
that
had
penetrated
the
*NL*
window
of
Gilbert
the
Bad
,
said
to
myself
,
``
Of
course
,
she
is
thinking
*NL*
about
me
.
''
I
fancied
that
I
had
found
favour
in
her
sight
,
that
she
*NL*
would
continue
to
think
of
me
after
she
had
left
the
church
,
and
would
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
grow
pensive
again
,
that
evening
,
at
Guermantes
,
on
my
account
.
*NL*
And
at
once
I
fell
in
love
with
her
,
for
if
it
is
sometimes
enough
to
*NL*
make
us
love
a
woman
that
she
looks
on
us
with
contempt
,
as
I
supposed
*NL*
Mlle.
Swann
to
have
done
,
while
we
imagine
that
she
can
not
ever
be
ours
,
*NL*
it
is
enough
,
also
,
sometimes
that
she
looks
on
us
kindly
,
as
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
did
then
,
while
we
think
of
her
as
almost
ours
already
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
waxed
blue
as
a
periwinkle
flower
,
wholly
beyond
my
reach
,
yet
*NL*
dedicated
by
her
to
me
;
and
the
sun
,
bursting
out
again
from
behind
*NL*
a
threatening
cloud
and
darting
the
full
force
of
its
rays
on
to
the
*NL*
Square
and
into
the
sacristy
,
shed
a
geranium
glow
over
the
red
carpet
*NL*
laid
down
for
the
wedding
,
along
which
Mme.
de
Guermantes
smilingly
*NL*
advanced
,
and
covered
its
woollen
texture
with
a
nap
of
rosy
velvet
,
a
*NL*
bloom
of
light
,
giving
it
that
sort
of
tenderness
,
of
solemn
sweetness
*NL*
in
the
pomp
of
a
joyful
celebration
,
which
characterises
certain
pages
*NL*
of
_
Lohengrin
_
,
certain
paintings
by
Carpaccio
,
and
makes
us
understand
*NL*
how
Baudelaire
was
able
to
apply
to
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
the
epithet
*NL*
`
delicious
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
How
often
,
after
that
day
,
in
the
course
of
my
walks
along
the
*NL*
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
and
with
what
an
intensified
melancholy
did
I
reflect
*NL*
on
my
lack
of
qualification
for
a
literary
career
,
and
that
I
must
*NL*
abandon
all
hope
of
ever
becoming
a
famous
author
.
The
regret
that
I
*NL*
felt
for
this
,
while
I
lingered
alone
to
dream
for
a
little
by
myself
,
*NL*
made
me
suffer
so
acutely
that
,
in
order
not
to
feel
it
,
my
mind
of
*NL*
its
own
accord
,
by
a
sort
of
inhibition
in
the
instant
of
pain
,
ceased
*NL*
entirely
to
think
of
verse-making
,
of
fiction
,
of
the
poetic
future
on
*NL*
which
my
want
of
talent
precluded
me
from
counting
.
Then
,
quite
apart
*NL*
from
all
those
literary
preoccupations
,
and
without
definite
attachment
*NL*
to
anything
,
suddenly
a
roof
,
a
gleam
of
sunlight
reflected
from
a
*NL*
stone
,
the
smell
of
a
road
would
make
me
stop
still
,
to
enjoy
the
*NL*
special
pleasure
that
each
of
them
gave
me
,
and
also
because
they
*NL*
appeared
to
be
concealing
,
beneath
what
my
eyes
could
see
,
something
*NL*
which
they
invited
me
to
approach
and
seize
from
them
,
but
which
,
*NL*
despite
all
my
efforts
,
I
never
managed
to
discover
.
As
I
felt
that
the
*NL*
mysterious
object
was
to
be
found
in
them
,
I
would
stand
there
in
front
*NL*
of
them
,
motionless
,
gazing
,
breathing
,
endeavouring
to
penetrate
with
*NL*
my
mind
beyond
the
thing
seen
or
smelt
.
And
if
I
had
then
to
hasten
*NL*
after
my
grandfather
,
to
proceed
on
my
way
,
I
would
still
seek
to
*NL*
recover
my
sense
of
them
by
closing
my
eyes
;
I
would
concentrate
upon
*NL*
recalling
exactly
the
line
of
the
roof
,
the
colour
of
the
stone
,
which
,
*NL*
without
my
being
able
to
understand
why
,
had
seemed
to
me
to
be
teeming
,
*NL*
ready
to
open
,
to
yield
up
to
me
the
secret
treasure
of
which
they
were
*NL*
themselves
no
more
than
the
outer
coverings
.
It
was
certainly
not
any
*NL*
impression
of
this
kind
that
could
or
would
restore
the
hope
I
had
lost
*NL*
of
succeeding
one
day
in
becoming
an
author
and
poet
,
for
each
of
them
*NL*
was
associated
with
some
material
object
devoid
of
any
intellectual
*NL*
value
,
and
suggesting
no
abstract
truth
.
But
at
least
they
gave
me
an
*NL*
unreasoning
pleasure
,
the
illusion
of
a
sort
of
fecundity
of
mind
;
and
*NL*
in
that
way
distracted
me
from
the
tedium
,
from
the
sense
of
my
own
*NL*
impotence
which
I
had
felt
whenever
I
had
sought
a
philosophic
theme
*NL*
for
some
great
literary
work
.
So
urgent
was
the
task
imposed
on
my
*NL*
conscience
by
these
impressions
of
form
or
perfume
or
colour
--
to
strive
*NL*
for
a
perception
of
what
lay
hidden
beneath
them
,
that
I
was
never
*NL*
long
in
seeking
an
excuse
which
would
allow
me
to
relax
so
strenuous
an
*NL*
effort
and
to
spare
myself
the
fatigue
that
it
involved
.
As
good
luck
*NL*
would
have
it
,
my
parents
called
me
;
I
felt
that
I
had
not
,
for
the
*NL*
moment
,
the
calm
environment
necessary
for
a
successful
pursuit
of
my
*NL*
researches
,
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
think
no
more
of
the
matter
*NL*
until
I
reached
home
,
and
not
to
exhaust
myself
in
the
meantime
to
no
*NL*
purpose
.
And
so
I
concerned
myself
no
longer
with
the
mystery
that
lay
*NL*
hidden
in
a
form
or
a
perfume
,
quite
at
ease
in
my
mind
,
since
I
was
*NL*
taking
it
home
with
me
,
protected
by
its
visible
and
tangible
covering
,
*NL*
beneath
which
I
should
find
it
still
alive
,
like
the
fish
which
,
on
days
*NL*
when
I
had
been
allowed
to
go
out
fishing
,
I
used
to
carry
back
in
my
*NL*
basket
,
buried
in
a
couch
of
grass
which
kept
them
cool
and
fresh
.
Once
*NL*
in
the
house
again
I
would
begin
to
think
of
something
else
,
and
so
my
*NL*
mind
would
become
littered
-LRB-
as
my
room
was
with
the
flowers
that
I
had
*NL*
gathered
on
my
walks
,
or
the
odds
and
ends
that
people
had
given
me
-RRB-
*NL*
with
a
stone
from
the
surface
of
which
the
sunlight
was
reflected
,
a
*NL*
roof
,
the
sound
of
a
bell
,
the
smell
of
fallen
leaves
,
a
confused
mass
*NL*
of
different
images
,
under
which
must
have
perished
long
ago
the
reality
*NL*
of
which
I
used
to
have
some
foreboding
,
but
which
I
never
had
the
*NL*
energy
to
discover
and
bring
to
light
.
Once
,
however
,
when
we
had
*NL*
prolonged
our
walk
far
beyond
its
ordinary
limits
,
and
so
had
been
very
*NL*
glad
to
encounter
,
half
way
home
,
as
afternoon
darkened
into
evening
,
*NL*
Dr.
Percepied
,
who
drove
past
us
at
full
speed
in
his
carriage
,
saw
and
*NL*
recognised
us
,
stopped
,
and
made
us
jump
in
beside
him
,
I
received
an
*NL*
impression
of
this
sort
which
I
did
not
abandon
without
having
first
*NL*
subjected
it
to
an
examination
a
little
more
thorough
.
I
had
been
set
*NL*
on
the
box
beside
the
coachman
,
we
were
going
like
the
wind
because
*NL*
the
Doctor
had
still
,
before
returning
to
Combray
,
to
call
at
*NL*
Martinville-le-Sec
,
at
the
house
of
a
patient
,
at
whose
door
he
asked
*NL*
us
to
wait
for
him
.
At
a
bend
in
the
road
I
experienced
,
suddenly
,
that
*NL*
special
pleasure
,
which
bore
no
resemblance
to
any
other
,
when
I
caught
*NL*
sight
of
the
twin
steeples
of
Martinville
,
on
which
the
setting
sun
was
*NL*
playing
,
while
the
movement
of
the
carriage
and
the
windings
of
the
road
*NL*
seemed
to
keep
them
continually
changing
their
position
;
and
then
of
a
*NL*
third
steeple
,
that
of
Vieuxvicq
,
which
,
although
separated
from
them
*NL*
by
a
hill
and
a
valley
,
and
rising
from
rather
higher
ground
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
appeared
none
the
less
to
be
standing
by
their
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
ascertaining
and
noting
the
shape
of
their
spires
,
the
changes
*NL*
of
aspect
,
the
sunny
warmth
of
their
surfaces
,
I
felt
that
I
was
not
*NL*
penetrating
to
the
full
depth
of
my
impression
,
that
something
more
lay
*NL*
behind
that
mobility
,
that
luminosity
,
something
which
they
seemed
at
*NL*
once
to
contain
and
to
conceal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
steeples
appeared
so
distant
,
and
we
ourselves
seemed
to
come
so
*NL*
little
nearer
them
,
that
I
was
astonished
when
,
a
few
minutes
later
,
we
*NL*
drew
up
outside
the
church
of
Martinville
.
I
did
not
know
the
reason
for
*NL*
the
pleasure
which
I
had
found
in
seeing
them
upon
the
horizon
,
and
*NL*
the
business
of
trying
to
find
out
what
that
reason
was
seemed
to
me
*NL*
irksome
;
I
wished
only
to
keep
in
reserve
in
my
brain
those
converging
*NL*
lines
,
moving
in
the
sunshine
,
and
,
for
the
time
being
,
to
think
of
*NL*
them
no
more
.
And
it
is
probable
that
,
had
I
done
so
,
those
two
steeples
*NL*
would
have
vanished
for
ever
,
in
a
great
medley
of
trees
and
roofs
and
*NL*
scents
and
sounds
which
I
had
noticed
and
set
apart
on
account
of
the
*NL*
obscure
sense
of
pleasure
which
they
gave
me
,
but
without
ever
exploring
*NL*
them
more
fully
.
I
got
down
from
the
box
to
talk
to
my
parents
while
we
*NL*
were
waiting
for
the
Doctor
to
reappear
.
Then
it
was
time
to
start
;
I
*NL*
climbed
up
again
to
my
place
,
turning
my
head
to
look
back
,
once
more
,
*NL*
at
my
steeples
,
of
which
,
a
little
later
,
I
caught
a
farewell
glimpse
*NL*
at
a
turn
in
the
road
.
The
coachman
,
who
seemed
little
inclined
for
*NL*
conversation
,
having
barely
acknowledged
my
remarks
,
I
was
obliged
,
*NL*
in
default
of
other
society
,
to
fall
back
on
my
own
,
and
to
attempt
to
*NL*
recapture
the
vision
of
my
steeples
.
And
presently
their
outlines
and
*NL*
their
sunlit
surface
,
as
though
they
had
been
a
sort
of
rind
,
were
*NL*
stripped
apart
;
a
little
of
what
they
had
concealed
from
me
became
*NL*
apparent
;
an
idea
came
into
my
mind
which
had
not
existed
for
me
a
*NL*
moment
earlier
,
framed
itself
in
words
in
my
head
;
and
the
pleasure
*NL*
with
which
the
first
sight
of
them
,
just
now
,
had
filled
me
was
so
much
*NL*
enhanced
that
,
overpowered
by
a
sort
of
intoxication
,
I
could
no
longer
*NL*
think
of
anything
but
them
.
At
this
point
,
although
we
had
now
travelled
*NL*
a
long
way
from
Martinville
,
I
turned
my
head
and
caught
sight
of
them
*NL*
again
,
quite
black
this
time
,
for
the
sun
had
meanwhile
set
.
Every
few
*NL*
minutes
a
turn
in
the
road
would
sweep
them
out
of
sight
;
then
they
*NL*
shewed
themselves
for
the
last
time
,
and
so
I
saw
them
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
admitting
to
myself
that
what
lay
buried
within
the
steeples
of
*NL*
Martinville
must
be
something
analogous
to
a
charming
phrase
,
since
it
*NL*
was
in
the
form
of
words
which
gave
me
pleasure
that
it
had
appeared
to
*NL*
me
,
I
borrowed
a
pencil
and
some
paper
from
the
Doctor
,
and
composed
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
jolting
of
the
carriage
,
to
appease
my
conscience
and
to
*NL*
satisfy
my
enthusiasm
,
the
following
little
fragment
,
which
I
have
since
*NL*
discovered
,
and
now
reproduce
,
with
only
a
slight
revision
here
and
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alone
,
rising
from
the
level
of
the
plain
,
and
seemingly
lost
in
*NL*
that
expanse
of
open
country
,
climbed
to
the
sky
the
twin
steeples
of
*NL*
Martinville
.
Presently
we
saw
three
:
springing
into
position
confronting
*NL*
them
by
a
daring
volt
,
a
third
,
a
dilatory
steeple
,
that
of
Vieuxvicq
,
*NL*
was
come
to
join
them
.
The
minutes
passed
,
we
were
moving
rapidly
,
and
*NL*
yet
the
three
steeples
were
always
a
long
way
ahead
of
us
,
like
*NL*
three
birds
perched
upon
the
plain
,
motionless
and
conspicuous
in
*NL*
the
sunlight
.
Then
the
steeple
of
Vieuxvicq
withdrew
,
took
its
proper
*NL*
distance
,
and
the
steeples
of
Martinville
remained
alone
,
gilded
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
,
which
,
even
at
that
distance
,
I
could
*NL*
see
playing
and
smiling
upon
their
sloped
sides
.
We
had
been
so
long
in
*NL*
approaching
them
that
I
was
thinking
of
the
time
that
must
still
elapse
*NL*
before
we
could
reach
them
when
,
of
a
sudden
,
the
carriage
,
having
*NL*
turned
a
corner
,
set
us
down
at
their
feet
;
and
they
had
flung
*NL*
themselves
so
abruptly
in
our
path
that
we
had
barely
time
to
stop
*NL*
before
being
dashed
against
the
porch
of
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
resumed
our
course
;
we
had
left
Martinville
some
little
time
,
and
*NL*
the
village
,
after
accompanying
us
for
a
few
seconds
,
had
already
*NL*
disappeared
,
when
,
lingering
alone
on
the
horizon
to
watch
our
flight
,
*NL*
its
steeples
and
that
of
Vieuxvicq
waved
once
again
,
in
token
of
*NL*
farewell
,
their
sun-bathed
pinnacles
.
Sometimes
one
would
withdraw
,
*NL*
so
that
the
other
two
might
watch
us
for
a
moment
still
;
then
the
road
*NL*
changed
direction
,
they
veered
in
the
light
like
three
golden
pivots
,
*NL*
and
vanished
from
my
gaze
.
But
,
a
little
later
,
when
we
were
already
*NL*
close
to
Combray
,
the
sun
having
set
meanwhile
,
I
caught
sight
of
them
*NL*
for
the
last
time
,
far
away
,
and
seeming
no
more
now
than
three
flowers
*NL*
painted
upon
the
sky
above
the
low
line
of
fields
.
They
made
me
think
,
*NL*
too
,
of
three
maidens
in
a
legend
,
abandoned
in
a
solitary
place
over
*NL*
which
night
had
begun
to
fall
;
and
while
we
drew
away
from
them
at
a
*NL*
gallop
,
I
could
see
them
timidly
seeking
their
way
,
and
,
after
some
*NL*
awkward
,
stumbling
movements
of
their
noble
silhouettes
,
drawing
close
*NL*
to
one
another
,
slipping
one
behind
another
,
shewing
nothing
more
,
*NL*
now
,
against
the
still
rosy
sky
than
a
single
dusky
form
,
charming
and
*NL*
resigned
,
and
so
vanishing
in
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
thought
again
of
this
page
,
but
at
the
moment
when
,
on
my
*NL*
corner
of
the
box-seat
,
where
the
Doctor
's
coachman
was
in
the
habit
*NL*
of
placing
,
in
a
hamper
,
the
fowls
which
he
had
bought
at
Martinville
*NL*
market
,
I
had
finished
writing
it
,
I
found
such
a
sense
of
happiness
,
*NL*
felt
that
it
had
so
entirely
relieved
my
mind
of
the
obsession
of
the
*NL*
steeples
,
and
of
the
mystery
which
they
concealed
,
that
,
as
though
I
*NL*
myself
were
a
hen
and
had
just
laid
an
egg
,
I
began
to
sing
at
the
top
*NL*
of
my
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
long
,
during
these
walks
,
I
had
been
able
to
muse
upon
the
*NL*
pleasure
that
there
would
be
in
the
friendship
of
the
Duchesse
de
*NL*
Guermantes
,
in
fishing
for
trout
,
in
drifting
by
myself
in
a
boat
on
the
*NL*
Vivonne
;
and
,
greedy
for
happiness
,
I
asked
nothing
more
from
life
,
in
*NL*
such
moments
,
than
that
it
should
consist
always
of
a
series
of
joyous
*NL*
afternoons
.
But
when
,
on
our
way
home
,
I
had
caught
sight
of
a
farm
,
on
*NL*
the
left
of
the
road
,
at
some
distance
from
two
other
farms
which
were
*NL*
themselves
close
together
,
and
from
which
,
to
return
to
Combray
,
we
need
*NL*
only
turn
down
an
avenue
of
oaks
,
bordered
on
one
side
by
a
series
of
*NL*
orchard-closes
,
each
one
planted
at
regular
intervals
with
apple-trees
*NL*
which
cast
upon
the
ground
,
when
they
were
lighted
by
the
setting
sun
,
*NL*
the
Japanese
stencil
of
their
shadows
;
then
,
sharply
,
my
heart
would
*NL*
begin
to
beat
,
I
would
know
that
in
half
an
hour
we
should
be
at
*NL*
home
,
and
that
there
,
as
was
the
rule
on
days
when
we
had
taken
the
*NL*
`
Guermantes
way
'
and
dinner
was
,
in
consequence
,
served
later
than
*NL*
usual
,
I
should
be
sent
to
bed
as
soon
as
I
had
swallowed
my
soup
,
so
*NL*
that
my
mother
,
kept
at
table
,
just
as
though
there
had
been
company
to
*NL*
dinner
,
would
not
come
upstairs
to
say
good
night
to
me
in
bed
.
The
zone
*NL*
of
melancholy
which
I
then
entered
was
totally
distinct
from
that
other
*NL*
zone
,
in
which
I
had
been
bounding
for
joy
a
moment
earlier
,
just
as
*NL*
sometimes
in
the
sky
a
band
of
pink
is
separated
,
as
though
by
a
line
*NL*
invisibly
ruled
,
from
a
band
of
green
or
black
.
You
may
see
a
bird
*NL*
flying
across
the
pink
;
it
draws
near
the
border-line
,
touches
it
,
*NL*
enters
and
is
lost
upon
the
black
.
The
longings
by
which
I
had
just
*NL*
now
been
absorbed
,
to
go
to
Guermantes
,
to
travel
,
to
live
a
life
of
*NL*
happiness
--
I
was
now
so
remote
from
them
that
their
fulfilment
would
*NL*
have
afforded
me
no
pleasure
.
How
readily
would
I
have
sacrificed
them
*NL*
all
,
just
to
be
able
to
cry
,
all
night
long
,
in
the
arms
of
Mamma
!
*NL*
Shuddering
with
emotion
,
I
could
not
take
my
agonised
eyes
from
my
*NL*
mother
's
face
,
which
was
not
to
appear
that
evening
in
the
bedroom
where
*NL*
I
could
see
myself
already
lying
,
in
imagination
;
and
wished
only
that
*NL*
I
were
lying
dead
.
And
this
state
would
persist
until
the
morrow
,
when
,
*NL*
the
rays
of
morning
leaning
their
bars
of
light
,
as
the
gardener
might
*NL*
lean
his
ladder
,
against
the
wall
overgrown
with
nasturtiums
,
which
*NL*
clambered
up
it
as
far
as
my
window-sill
,
I
would
leap
out
of
bed
to
run
*NL*
down
at
once
into
the
garden
,
with
no
thought
of
the
fact
that
evening
*NL*
must
return
,
and
with
it
the
hour
when
I
must
leave
my
mother
.
And
so
*NL*
it
was
from
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
that
I
learned
to
distinguish
between
*NL*
these
states
which
reigned
alternately
in
my
mind
,
during
certain
*NL*
periods
,
going
so
far
as
to
divide
every
day
between
them
,
each
one
*NL*
returning
to
dispossess
the
other
with
the
regularity
of
a
fever
and
*NL*
ague
:
contiguous
,
and
yet
so
foreign
to
one
another
,
so
devoid
of
means
*NL*
of
communication
,
that
I
could
no
longer
understand
,
or
even
picture
to
*NL*
myself
,
in
one
state
what
I
had
desired
or
dreaded
or
even
done
in
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
'M
√©s√©glise
way
'
and
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
remain
for
me
linked
*NL*
with
many
of
the
little
incidents
of
that
one
of
all
the
divers
lives
*NL*
along
whose
parallel
lines
we
are
moved
,
which
is
the
most
abundant
in
*NL*
sudden
reverses
of
fortune
,
the
richest
in
episodes
;
I
mean
the
life
of
*NL*
the
mind
.
Doubtless
it
makes
in
us
an
imperceptible
progress
,
and
the
*NL*
truths
which
have
changed
for
us
its
meaning
and
its
aspect
,
which
have
*NL*
opened
new
paths
before
our
feet
,
we
had
for
long
been
preparing
for
*NL*
their
discovery
;
but
that
preparation
was
unconscious
;
and
for
us
*NL*
those
truths
date
only
from
the
day
,
from
the
minute
when
they
became
*NL*
apparent
.
The
flowers
which
played
then
among
the
grass
,
the
water
*NL*
which
rippled
past
in
the
sunshine
,
the
whole
landscape
which
served
as
*NL*
environment
to
their
apparition
lingers
around
the
memory
of
them
still
*NL*
with
its
unconscious
or
unheeding
air
;
and
,
certainly
,
when
they
were
*NL*
slowly
scrutinised
by
this
humble
passer-by
,
by
this
dreaming
*NL*
child
--
as
the
face
of
a
king
is
scrutinised
by
a
petitioner
lost
in
the
*NL*
crowd
--
that
scrap
of
nature
,
that
corner
of
a
garden
could
never
suppose
*NL*
that
it
would
be
thanks
to
him
that
they
would
be
elected
to
survive
in
*NL*
all
their
most
ephemeral
details
;
and
yet
the
scent
of
hawthorn
which
*NL*
strays
plundering
along
the
hedge
from
which
,
in
a
little
while
,
the
*NL*
dog-roses
will
have
banished
it
,
a
sound
of
footsteps
followed
by
no
*NL*
echo
,
upon
a
gravel
path
,
a
bubble
formed
at
the
side
of
a
waterplant
by
*NL*
the
current
,
and
formed
only
to
burst
--
my
exaltation
of
mind
has
borne
*NL*
them
with
it
,
and
has
succeeded
in
making
them
traverse
all
these
*NL*
successive
years
,
while
all
around
them
the
one-trodden
ways
have
*NL*
vanished
,
while
those
who
thronged
those
ways
,
and
even
the
memory
of
*NL*
those
who
thronged
those
trodden
ways
,
are
dead
.
Sometimes
the
fragment
*NL*
of
landscape
thus
transported
into
the
present
will
detach
itself
in
*NL*
such
isolation
from
all
associations
that
it
floats
uncertainly
upon
my
*NL*
mind
,
like
a
flowering
isle
of
Delos
,
and
I
am
unable
to
say
from
*NL*
what
place
,
from
what
time
--
perhaps
,
quite
simply
,
from
which
of
my
*NL*
dreams
--
it
comes
.
But
it
is
pre-eminently
as
the
deepest
layer
of
my
*NL*
mental
soil
,
as
firm
sites
on
which
I
still
may
build
,
that
I
regard
*NL*
the
M√©s√©glise
and
Guermantes
`
ways
.
'
It
is
because
I
used
to
think
of
*NL*
certain
things
,
of
certain
people
,
while
I
was
roaming
along
them
,
that
*NL*
the
things
,
the
people
which
they
taught
me
to
know
,
and
these
alone
,
*NL*
I
still
take
seriously
,
still
give
me
joy
.
Whether
it
be
that
the
faith
*NL*
which
creates
has
ceased
to
exist
in
me
,
or
that
reality
will
take
shape
*NL*
in
the
memory
alone
,
the
flowers
that
people
shew
me
nowadays
for
the
*NL*
first
time
never
seem
to
me
to
be
true
flowers
.
The
'M
√©s√©glise
way
'
*NL*
with
its
lilacs
,
its
hawthorns
,
its
cornflowers
,
its
poppies
,
its
*NL*
apple-trees
,
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
with
its
river
full
of
tadpoles
,
its
*NL*
water-lilies
,
and
its
buttercups
have
constituted
for
me
for
all
time
*NL*
the
picture
of
the
land
in
which
I
fain
would
pass
my
life
,
in
which
my
*NL*
only
requirements
are
that
I
may
go
out
fishing
,
drift
idly
in
a
boat
,
*NL*
see
the
ruins
of
a
gothic
fortress
in
the
grass
,
and
find
hidden
among
*NL*
the
cornfields
--
as
Saint-Andr√©-des-Champs
lay
hidden
--
an
old
church
,
*NL*
monumental
,
rustic
,
and
yellow
like
a
mill-stone
;
and
the
cornflowers
,
*NL*
the
hawthorns
,
the
apple-trees
which
I
may
happen
,
when
I
go
walking
,
to
*NL*
encounter
in
the
fields
,
because
they
are
situated
at
the
same
depth
,
on
*NL*
the
level
of
my
past
life
,
at
once
establish
contact
with
my
heart
.
And
*NL*
yet
,
because
there
is
an
element
of
individuality
in
places
,
when
I
am
*NL*
seized
with
a
desire
to
see
again
the
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
it
would
not
*NL*
be
satisfied
were
I
led
to
the
banks
of
a
river
in
which
were
lilies
*NL*
as
fair
,
or
even
fairer
than
those
in
the
Vivonne
,
any
more
than
on
my
*NL*
return
home
in
the
evening
,
at
the
hour
when
there
awakened
in
me
that
*NL*
anguish
which
,
later
on
in
life
,
transfers
itself
to
the
passion
of
*NL*
love
,
and
may
even
become
its
inseparable
companion
,
I
should
have
*NL*
wished
for
any
strange
mother
to
come
in
and
say
good
night
to
me
,
*NL*
though
she
were
far
more
beautiful
and
more
intelligent
than
my
own
.
No
:
*NL*
just
as
the
one
thing
necessary
to
send
me
to
sleep
contented
-LRB-
in
that
*NL*
untroubled
peace
which
no
mistress
,
in
later
years
,
has
ever
been
able
*NL*
to
give
me
,
since
one
has
doubts
of
them
at
the
moment
when
one
believes
*NL*
in
them
,
and
never
can
possess
their
hearts
as
I
used
to
receive
,
in
her
*NL*
kiss
,
the
heart
of
my
mother
,
complete
,
without
scruple
or
reservation
,
*NL*
unburdened
by
any
liability
save
to
myself
-RRB-
was
that
it
should
be
my
*NL*
mother
who
came
,
that
she
should
incline
towards
me
that
face
on
which
*NL*
there
was
,
beneath
her
eye
,
something
that
was
,
it
appears
,
a
blemish
,
*NL*
and
which
I
loved
as
much
as
all
the
rest
--
so
what
I
want
to
see
again
*NL*
is
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
as
I
knew
it
,
with
the
farm
that
stood
a
little
*NL*
apart
from
the
two
neighbouring
farms
,
pressed
so
close
together
,
at
the
*NL*
entrance
to
the
oak
avenue
;
those
meadows
upon
whose
surface
,
when
it
*NL*
is
polished
by
the
sun
to
the
mirroring
radiance
of
a
lake
,
are
outlined
*NL*
the
leaves
of
the
apple-trees
;
that
whole
landscape
whose
individuality
*NL*
sometimes
,
at
night
,
in
my
dreams
,
binds
me
with
a
power
that
is
almost
*NL*
fantastic
,
of
which
I
can
discover
no
trace
when
I
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
,
by
virtue
of
having
permanently
and
indissolubly
combined
in
*NL*
me
groups
of
different
impressions
,
for
no
reason
save
that
they
had
*NL*
made
me
feel
several
separate
things
at
the
same
time
,
the
M√©s√©glise
*NL*
and
Guermantes
`
ways
'
left
me
exposed
,
in
later
life
,
to
much
*NL*
disillusionment
,
and
even
to
many
mistakes
.
For
often
I
have
wished
to
*NL*
see
a
person
again
without
realising
that
it
was
simply
because
that
*NL*
person
recalled
to
me
a
hedge
of
hawthorns
in
blossom
;
and
I
have
been
*NL*
led
to
believe
,
and
to
make
some
one
else
believe
in
an
aftermath
of
*NL*
affection
,
by
what
was
no
more
than
an
inclination
to
travel
.
But
by
*NL*
the
same
qualities
,
and
by
their
persistence
in
those
of
my
impressions
,
*NL*
to-day
,
to
which
they
can
find
an
attachment
,
the
two
`
ways
'
give
to
*NL*
those
impressions
a
foundation
,
depth
,
a
dimension
lacking
from
the
*NL*
rest
.
They
invest
them
,
too
,
with
a
charm
,
a
significance
which
is
for
*NL*
me
alone
.
When
,
on
a
summer
evening
,
the
resounding
sky
growls
like
a
*NL*
tawny
lion
,
and
everyone
is
complaining
of
the
storm
,
it
is
along
the
*NL*
'M
√©s√©glise
way
'
that
my
fancy
strays
alone
in
ecstasy
,
inhaling
,
*NL*
through
the
noise
of
falling
rain
,
the
odour
of
invisible
and
persistent
*NL*
lilac-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
I
would
often
lie
until
morning
,
dreaming
of
the
old
days
at
*NL*
Combray
,
of
my
melancholy
and
wakeful
evenings
there
;
of
other
days
*NL*
besides
,
the
memory
of
which
had
been
more
lately
restored
to
me
by
the
*NL*
taste
--
by
what
would
have
been
called
at
Combray
the
`
perfume
'
--
of
a
*NL*
cup
of
tea
;
and
,
by
an
association
of
memories
,
of
a
story
which
,
many
*NL*
years
after
I
had
left
the
little
place
,
had
been
told
me
of
a
love
*NL*
affair
in
which
Swann
had
been
involved
before
I
was
born
;
with
that
*NL*
accuracy
of
detail
which
it
is
easier
,
often
,
to
obtain
when
we
are
*NL*
studying
the
lives
of
people
who
have
been
dead
for
centuries
than
when
*NL*
we
are
trying
to
chronicle
those
of
our
own
most
intimate
friends
,
an
*NL*
accuracy
which
it
seems
as
impossible
to
attain
as
it
seemed
impossible
*NL*
to
speak
from
one
town
to
another
,
before
we
learned
of
the
contrivance
*NL*
by
which
that
impossibility
has
been
overcome
.
All
these
memories
,
*NL*
following
one
after
another
,
were
condensed
into
a
single
substance
,
*NL*
but
had
not
so
far
coalesced
that
I
could
not
discern
between
the
*NL*
three
strata
,
between
my
oldest
,
my
instinctive
memories
,
those
others
,
*NL*
inspired
more
recently
by
a
taste
or
`
perfume
,
'
and
those
which
were
*NL*
actually
the
memories
of
another
,
from
whom
I
had
acquired
them
at
*NL*
second
hand
--
no
fissures
,
indeed
,
no
geological
faults
,
but
at
least
*NL*
those
veins
,
those
streaks
of
colour
which
in
certain
rocks
,
in
certain
*NL*
marbles
,
point
to
differences
of
origin
,
age
,
and
formation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
,
when
morning
drew
near
,
I
would
long
have
settled
the
*NL*
brief
uncertainty
of
my
waking
dream
,
I
would
know
in
what
room
I
*NL*
was
actually
lying
,
would
have
reconstructed
it
round
about
me
in
*NL*
the
darkness
,
and
--
fixing
my
orientation
by
memory
alone
,
or
with
the
*NL*
assistance
of
a
feeble
glimmer
of
light
at
the
foot
of
which
I
placed
*NL*
the
curtains
and
the
window
--
would
have
reconstructed
it
complete
and
*NL*
with
its
furniture
,
as
an
architect
and
an
upholsterer
might
do
,
working
*NL*
upon
an
original
,
discarded
plan
of
the
doors
and
windows
;
would
have
*NL*
replaced
the
mirrors
and
set
the
chest-of-drawers
on
its
accustomed
*NL*
site
.
`
But
scarcely
had
daylight
itself
--
and
no
longer
the
gleam
from
*NL*
a
last
,
dying
ember
on
a
brass
curtain-rod
,
which
I
had
mistaken
for
*NL*
daylight
--
traced
across
the
darkness
,
as
with
a
stroke
of
chalk
across
*NL*
a
blackboard
,
its
first
white
correcting
ray
,
when
the
window
,
with
*NL*
its
curtains
,
would
leave
the
frame
of
the
doorway
,
in
which
I
had
*NL*
erroneously
placed
it
,
while
,
to
make
room
for
it
,
the
writing-table
,
*NL*
which
my
memory
had
clumsily
fixed
where
the
window
ought
to
be
,
would
*NL*
hurry
off
at
full
speed
,
thrusting
before
it
the
mantelpiece
,
and
*NL*
sweeping
aside
the
wall
of
the
passage
;
the
well
of
the
courtyard
would
*NL*
be
enthroned
on
the
spot
where
,
a
moment
earlier
,
my
dressing-room
had
*NL*
lain
,
and
the
dwelling-place
which
I
had
built
up
for
myself
in
the
*NL*
darkness
would
have
gone
to
join
all
those
other
dwellings
of
which
I
*NL*
had
caught
glimpses
from
the
whirlpool
of
awakening
;
put
to
flight
*NL*
by
that
pale
sign
traced
above
my
window-curtains
by
the
uplifted
*NL*
forefinger
of
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
SWANN
IN
LOVE
*NL*
*NL*
To
admit
you
to
the
`
little
nucleus
,
'
the
`
little
group
,
'
the
`
little
*NL*
clan
'
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
one
condition
sufficed
,
but
that
one
was
*NL*
indispensable
;
you
must
give
tacit
adherence
to
a
Creed
one
of
whose
*NL*
articles
was
that
the
young
pianist
,
whom
Mme.
Verdurin
had
taken
under
*NL*
her
patronage
that
year
,
and
of
whom
she
said
``
Really
,
it
ought
n't
to
*NL*
be
allowed
,
to
play
Wagner
as
well
as
that
!
''
left
both
Plant√©
*NL*
and
Rubinstein
`
sitting
'
;
while
Dr.
Cottard
was
a
more
brilliant
*NL*
diagnostician
than
Potain
.
Each
`
new
recruit
'
whom
the
Verdurins
failed
*NL*
to
persuade
that
the
evenings
spent
by
other
people
,
in
other
houses
*NL*
than
theirs
,
were
as
dull
as
ditch-water
,
saw
himself
banished
*NL*
forthwith
.
Women
being
in
this
respect
more
rebellious
than
men
,
more
*NL*
reluctant
to
lay
aside
all
worldly
curiosity
and
the
desire
to
find
out
*NL*
for
themselves
whether
other
drawing-rooms
might
not
sometimes
be
as
*NL*
entertaining
,
and
the
Verdurins
feeling
,
moreover
,
that
this
critical
*NL*
spirit
and
this
demon
of
frivolity
might
,
by
their
contagion
,
prove
*NL*
fatal
to
the
orthodoxy
of
the
little
church
,
they
had
been
obliged
to
*NL*
expel
,
one
after
another
,
all
those
of
the
`
faithful
'
who
were
of
the
*NL*
female
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apart
from
the
doctor
's
young
wife
,
they
were
reduced
almost
exclusively
*NL*
that
season
-LRB-
for
all
that
Mme.
Verdurin
herself
was
a
thoroughly
`
good
'
*NL*
woman
,
and
came
of
a
respectable
middle-class
family
,
excessively
rich
*NL*
and
wholly
undistinguished
,
with
which
she
had
gradually
and
of
her
own
*NL*
accord
severed
all
connection
-RRB-
to
a
young
woman
almost
of
a
`
certain
*NL*
class
,
'
a
Mme.
de
Cr√©cy
,
whom
Mme.
Verdurin
called
by
her
Christian
*NL*
name
,
Odette
,
and
pronounced
a
`
love
,
'
and
to
the
pianist
's
aunt
,
who
*NL*
looked
as
though
she
had
,
at
one
period
,
`
answered
the
bell
'
:
ladies
*NL*
quite
ignorant
of
the
world
,
who
in
their
social
simplicity
were
so
*NL*
easily
led
to
believe
that
the
Princesse
de
Sagan
and
the
Duchesse
*NL*
de
Guermantes
were
obliged
to
pay
large
sums
of
money
to
other
poor
*NL*
wretches
,
in
order
to
have
anyone
at
their
dinner-parties
,
that
if
*NL*
somebody
had
offered
to
procure
them
an
invitation
to
the
house
of
*NL*
either
of
those
great
dames
,
the
old
doorkeeper
and
the
woman
of
`
easy
*NL*
virtue
'
would
have
contemptuously
declined
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Verdurins
never
invited
you
to
dinner
;
you
had
your
`
place
laid
'
*NL*
there
.
There
was
never
any
programme
for
the
evening
's
entertainment
.
*NL*
The
young
pianist
would
play
,
but
only
if
he
felt
inclined
,
for
no
one
*NL*
was
forced
to
do
anything
,
and
,
as
M.
Verdurin
used
to
say
:
``
We
're
all
*NL*
friends
here
.
Liberty
Hall
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
pianist
suggested
playing
the
Ride
of
the
Valkyries
,
or
the
*NL*
Prelude
to
Tristan
,
Mme.
Verdurin
would
protest
,
not
that
the
music
was
*NL*
displeasing
to
her
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
it
made
too
violent
an
*NL*
impression
.
``
Then
you
want
me
to
have
one
of
my
headaches
?
You
know
*NL*
quite
well
,
it
's
the
same
every
time
he
plays
that
.
I
know
what
I
'm
*NL*
in
for
.
Tomorrow
,
when
I
want
to
get
up
--
nothing
doing
!
''
If
he
was
not
*NL*
going
to
play
they
talked
,
and
one
of
the
friends
--
usually
the
painter
*NL*
who
was
in
favour
there
that
year
--
would
``
spin
,
''
as
M.
Verdurin
put
*NL*
it
,
``
a
damned
funny
yarn
that
made
'em
all
split
with
laughter
,
''
and
*NL*
especially
Mme.
Verdurin
,
for
whom
--
so
strong
was
her
habit
of
taking
*NL*
literally
the
figurative
accounts
of
her
emotions
--
Dr.
Cottard
,
who
was
*NL*
then
just
starting
in
general
practice
,
would
``
really
have
to
come
one
*NL*
day
and
set
her
jaw
,
which
she
had
dislocated
with
laughing
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
dress
was
barred
,
because
you
were
all
`
good
pals
,
'
and
did
n't
*NL*
want
to
look
like
the
`
boring
people
'
who
were
to
be
avoided
like
the
*NL*
plague
,
and
only
asked
to
the
big
evenings
,
which
were
given
as
seldom
*NL*
as
possible
,
and
then
only
if
it
would
amuse
the
painter
or
make
the
*NL*
musician
better
known
.
The
rest
of
the
time
you
were
quite
happy
playing
*NL*
charades
and
having
supper
in
fancy
dress
,
and
there
was
no
need
to
*NL*
mingle
any
strange
element
with
the
little
`
clan
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
as
the
`
good
pals
'
came
to
take
a
more
and
more
prominent
place
*NL*
in
Mme.
Verdurin
's
life
,
so
the
`
bores
,
'
the
`
nuisances
'
grew
to
include
*NL*
everybody
and
everything
that
kept
her
friends
away
from
her
,
that
made
*NL*
them
sometimes
plead
`
previous
engagements
,
'
the
mother
of
one
,
the
*NL*
professional
duties
of
another
,
the
`
little
place
in
the
country
'
of
a
*NL*
third
.
If
Dr.
Cottard
felt
bound
to
say
good
night
as
soon
as
they
rose
*NL*
from
table
,
so
as
to
go
back
to
some
patient
who
was
seriously
ill
;
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
would
say
,
``
I
'm
sure
it
will
do
him
far
more
*NL*
good
if
you
do
n't
go
disturbing
him
again
this
evening
;
he
will
have
a
*NL*
good
night
without
you
;
to-morrow
morning
you
can
go
round
early
and
you
*NL*
will
find
him
cured
.
''
From
the
beginning
of
December
it
would
make
her
*NL*
quite
ill
to
think
that
the
`
faithful
'
might
fail
her
on
Christmas
and
*NL*
New
Year
's
Days
.
The
pianist
's
aunt
insisted
that
he
must
accompany
her
,
*NL*
on
the
latter
,
to
a
family
dinner
at
her
mother
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
suppose
she
'll
die
,
your
mother
,
''
exclaimed
Mme.
Verdurin
*NL*
bitterly
,
``
if
you
do
n't
have
dinner
with
her
on
New
Year
's
Day
,
like
*NL*
people
in
the
_
provinces
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
uneasiness
was
kindled
again
in
Holy
Week
:
``
Now
you
,
Doctor
,
you
're
*NL*
a
sensible
,
broad-minded
man
;
you
'll
come
,
of
course
,
on
Good
Friday
,
*NL*
just
like
any
other
day
?
''
she
said
to
Cottard
in
the
first
year
of
the
*NL*
little
`
nucleus
,
'
in
a
loud
and
confident
voice
,
as
though
there
could
*NL*
be
no
doubt
of
his
answer
.
But
she
trembled
as
she
waited
for
it
,
for
if
*NL*
he
did
not
come
she
might
find
herself
condemned
to
dine
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
on
Good
Friday
--
to
say
good-bye
to
you
,
for
we
are
going
*NL*
to
spend
the
holidays
in
Auvergne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Auvergne
?
To
be
eaten
by
fleas
and
all
sorts
of
creatures
!
A
fine
*NL*
lot
of
good
that
will
do
you
!
''
And
after
a
solemn
pause
:
``
If
you
had
*NL*
only
told
us
,
we
would
have
tried
to
get
up
a
party
,
and
all
gone
there
*NL*
together
,
comfortably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
too
,
if
one
of
the
`
faithful
'
had
a
friend
,
or
one
of
the
ladies
*NL*
a
young
man
,
who
was
liable
,
now
and
then
,
to
make
them
miss
an
evening
,
*NL*
the
Verdurins
,
who
were
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
a
woman
's
having
a
*NL*
lover
,
provided
that
she
had
him
in
their
company
,
loved
him
in
their
*NL*
company
and
did
not
prefer
him
to
their
company
,
would
say
:
``
Very
well
,
*NL*
then
,
bring
your
friend
along
.
''
And
he
would
be
put
to
the
test
,
to
see
*NL*
whether
he
was
willing
to
have
no
secrets
from
Mme.
Verdurin
,
whether
he
*NL*
was
susceptible
of
being
enrolled
in
the
`
little
clan
.
'
If
he
failed
*NL*
to
pass
,
the
faithful
one
who
had
introduced
him
would
be
taken
on
one
*NL*
side
,
and
would
be
tactfully
assisted
to
quarrel
with
the
friend
or
*NL*
mistress
.
But
if
the
test
proved
satisfactory
,
the
newcomer
would
in
*NL*
turn
be
numbered
among
the
`
faithful
.
'
And
so
when
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
this
same
year
,
the
courtesan
told
M.
Verdurin
that
she
had
made
the
*NL*
acquaintance
of
such
a
charming
gentleman
,
M.
Swann
,
and
hinted
that
*NL*
he
would
very
much
like
to
be
allowed
to
come
,
M.
Verdurin
carried
the
*NL*
request
at
once
to
his
wife
.
He
never
formed
an
opinion
on
any
subject
*NL*
until
she
had
formed
hers
,
his
special
duty
being
to
carry
out
her
*NL*
wishes
and
those
of
the
`
faithful
'
generally
,
which
he
did
with
*NL*
boundless
ingenuity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
Mme.
de
Cr√©cy
has
something
to
say
to
you
.
She
would
like
to
*NL*
bring
one
of
her
friends
here
,
a
M.
Swann
.
What
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
as
if
anybody
could
refuse
anything
to
a
little
piece
of
*NL*
perfection
like
that
.
Be
quiet
;
no
one
asked
your
opinion
.
I
tell
you
*NL*
that
you
are
a
piece
of
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
you
like
,
''
replied
Odette
,
in
an
affected
tone
,
and
then
went
*NL*
on
:
``
You
know
I
'm
not
fishing
for
compliments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
bring
your
friend
,
if
he
's
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
there
was
no
connection
whatsoever
between
the
`
little
nucleus
'
and
*NL*
the
society
which
Swann
frequented
,
and
a
purely
worldly
man
would
*NL*
have
thought
it
hardly
worth
his
while
,
when
occupying
so
exceptional
*NL*
a
position
in
the
world
,
to
seek
an
introduction
to
the
Verdurins
.
But
*NL*
Swann
was
so
ardent
a
lover
that
,
once
he
had
got
to
know
almost
all
the
*NL*
women
of
the
aristocracy
,
once
they
had
taught
him
all
that
there
was
*NL*
to
learn
,
he
had
ceased
to
regard
those
naturalisation
papers
,
almost
a
*NL*
patent
of
nobility
,
which
the
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
had
bestowed
upon
*NL*
him
,
save
as
a
sort
of
negotiable
bond
,
a
letter
of
credit
with
no
*NL*
intrinsic
value
,
which
allowed
him
to
improvise
a
status
for
himself
in
*NL*
some
little
hole
in
the
country
,
or
in
some
obscure
quarter
of
Paris
,
*NL*
where
the
good-looking
daughter
of
a
local
squire
or
solicitor
had
taken
*NL*
his
fancy
.
For
at
such
times
desire
,
or
love
itself
,
would
revive
in
*NL*
him
a
feeling
of
vanity
from
which
he
was
now
quite
free
in
his
everyday
*NL*
life
,
although
it
was
,
no
doubt
,
the
same
feeling
which
had
originally
*NL*
prompted
him
towards
that
career
as
a
man
of
fashion
in
which
he
had
*NL*
squandered
his
intellectual
gifts
upon
frivolous
amusements
,
and
had
*NL*
made
use
of
his
erudition
in
matters
of
art
only
to
advise
society
*NL*
ladies
what
pictures
to
buy
and
how
to
decorate
their
houses
;
and
this
*NL*
vanity
it
was
which
made
him
eager
to
shine
,
in
the
sight
of
any
fair
*NL*
unknown
who
had
captivated
him
for
the
moment
,
with
a
brilliance
which
*NL*
the
name
of
Swann
by
itself
did
not
emit
.
And
he
was
most
eager
when
the
*NL*
fair
unknown
was
in
humble
circumstances
.
Just
as
it
is
not
by
other
*NL*
men
of
intelligence
that
an
intelligent
man
is
afraid
of
being
thought
*NL*
a
fool
,
so
it
is
not
by
the
great
gentleman
but
by
boors
and
`
bounders
'
*NL*
that
a
man
of
fashion
is
afraid
of
finding
his
social
value
underrated
.
*NL*
Three-fourths
of
the
mental
ingenuity
displayed
,
of
the
social
*NL*
falsehoods
scattered
broadcast
ever
since
the
world
began
by
people
*NL*
whose
importance
they
have
served
only
to
diminish
,
have
been
aimed
at
*NL*
inferiors
.
And
Swann
,
who
behaved
quite
simply
and
was
at
his
ease
when
*NL*
with
a
duchess
,
would
tremble
for
fear
of
being
despised
,
and
would
*NL*
instantly
begin
to
pose
,
were
he
to
meet
her
grace
's
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unlike
so
many
people
,
who
,
either
from
lack
of
energy
or
else
from
a
*NL*
resigned
sense
of
the
obligation
laid
upon
them
by
their
social
grandeur
*NL*
to
remain
moored
like
houseboats
to
a
certain
point
on
the
bank
of
the
*NL*
stream
of
life
,
abstain
from
the
pleasures
which
are
offered
to
them
*NL*
above
and
below
that
point
,
that
degree
in
life
in
which
they
will
*NL*
remain
fixed
until
the
day
of
their
death
,
and
are
content
,
in
the
*NL*
end
,
to
describe
as
pleasures
,
for
want
of
any
better
,
those
mediocre
*NL*
distractions
,
that
just
not
intolerable
tedium
which
is
enclosed
there
*NL*
with
them
;
Swann
would
endeavour
not
to
find
charm
and
beauty
in
the
*NL*
women
with
whom
he
must
pass
time
,
but
to
pass
his
time
among
women
whom
*NL*
he
had
already
found
to
be
beautiful
and
charming
.
And
these
were
,
as
*NL*
often
as
not
,
women
whose
beauty
was
of
a
distinctly
`
common
'
type
,
for
*NL*
the
physical
qualities
which
attracted
him
instinctively
,
and
without
*NL*
reason
,
were
the
direct
opposite
of
those
that
he
admired
in
the
women
*NL*
painted
or
sculptured
by
his
favourite
masters
.
Depth
of
character
,
or
*NL*
a
melancholy
expression
on
a
woman
's
face
would
freeze
his
senses
,
which
*NL*
would
,
however
,
immediately
melt
at
the
sight
of
healthy
,
abundant
,
rosy
*NL*
human
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
on
his
travels
he
met
a
family
whom
it
would
have
been
more
correct
*NL*
for
him
to
make
no
attempt
to
know
,
but
among
whom
a
woman
caught
his
*NL*
eye
,
adorned
with
a
special
charm
that
was
new
to
him
,
to
remain
on
his
*NL*
`
high
horse
'
and
to
cheat
the
desire
that
she
had
kindled
in
him
,
to
*NL*
substitute
a
pleasure
different
from
that
which
he
might
have
tasted
in
*NL*
her
company
by
writing
to
invite
one
of
his
former
mistresses
to
come
*NL*
and
join
him
,
would
have
seemed
to
him
as
cowardly
an
abdication
in
the
*NL*
face
of
life
,
as
stupid
a
renunciation
of
a
new
form
of
happiness
as
if
,
*NL*
instead
of
visiting
the
country
where
he
was
,
he
had
shut
himself
up
in
*NL*
his
own
rooms
and
looked
at
`
views
'
of
Paris
.
He
did
not
immure
himself
*NL*
in
the
solid
structure
of
his
social
relations
,
but
had
made
of
them
,
so
*NL*
as
to
be
able
to
set
it
up
afresh
upon
new
foundations
wherever
a
woman
*NL*
might
take
his
fancy
,
one
of
those
collapsible
tents
which
explorers
*NL*
carry
about
with
them
.
Any
part
of
it
which
was
not
portable
or
could
*NL*
not
be
adapted
to
some
fresh
pleasure
he
would
discard
as
valueless
,
*NL*
however
enviable
it
might
appear
to
others
.
How
often
had
his
credit
*NL*
with
a
duchess
,
built
up
of
the
yearly
accumulation
of
her
desire
to
*NL*
do
him
some
favour
for
which
she
had
never
found
an
opportunity
,
been
*NL*
squandered
in
a
moment
by
his
calling
upon
her
,
in
an
indiscreetly
*NL*
worded
message
,
for
a
recommendation
by
telegraph
which
would
put
him
*NL*
in
touch
at
once
with
one
of
her
agents
whose
daughter
he
had
noticed
in
*NL*
the
country
,
just
as
a
starving
man
might
barter
a
diamond
for
a
crust
*NL*
of
bread
.
Indeed
,
when
it
was
too
late
,
he
would
laugh
at
himself
for
*NL*
it
,
for
there
was
in
his
nature
,
redeemed
by
many
rare
refinements
,
an
*NL*
element
of
clownishness
.
Then
he
belonged
to
that
class
of
intelligent
*NL*
men
who
have
led
a
life
of
idleness
,
and
who
seek
consolation
and
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
an
excuse
in
the
idea
,
which
their
idleness
offers
to
their
*NL*
intelligence
,
of
objects
as
worthy
of
their
interest
as
any
that
could
*NL*
be
attained
by
art
or
learning
,
the
idea
that
`
Life
'
contains
situations
*NL*
more
interesting
and
more
romantic
than
all
the
romances
ever
written
.
*NL*
So
,
at
least
,
he
would
assure
and
had
no
difficulty
in
persuading
the
*NL*
more
subtle
among
his
friends
in
the
fashionable
world
,
notably
the
*NL*
Baron
de
Charlus
,
whom
he
liked
to
amuse
with
stories
of
the
startling
*NL*
adventures
that
had
befallen
him
,
such
as
when
he
had
met
a
woman
in
the
*NL*
train
,
and
had
taken
her
home
with
him
,
before
discovering
that
she
was
*NL*
the
sister
of
a
reigning
monarch
,
in
whose
hands
were
gathered
,
at
that
*NL*
moment
,
all
the
threads
of
European
politics
,
of
which
he
found
himself
*NL*
kept
informed
in
the
most
delightful
fashion
,
or
when
,
in
the
complexity
*NL*
of
circumstances
,
it
depended
upon
the
choice
which
the
Conclave
*NL*
was
about
to
make
whether
he
might
or
might
not
become
the
lover
of
*NL*
somebody
's
cook
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
only
the
brilliant
phalanx
of
virtuous
dowagers
,
generals
*NL*
and
academicians
,
to
whom
he
was
bound
by
such
close
ties
,
that
Swann
*NL*
compelled
with
so
much
cynicism
to
serve
him
as
panders
.
All
his
friends
*NL*
were
accustomed
to
receive
,
from
time
to
time
,
letters
which
called
on
*NL*
them
for
a
word
of
recommendation
or
introduction
,
with
a
diplomatic
*NL*
adroitness
which
,
persisting
throughout
all
his
successive
`
affairs
'
*NL*
and
using
different
pretexts
,
revealed
more
glaringly
than
the
clumsiest
*NL*
indiscretion
,
a
permanent
trait
in
his
character
and
an
unvarying
quest
.
*NL*
I
used
often
to
recall
to
myself
when
,
many
years
later
,
I
began
to
*NL*
take
an
interest
in
his
character
because
of
the
similarities
which
,
in
*NL*
wholly
different
respects
,
it
offered
to
my
own
,
how
,
when
he
used
to
*NL*
write
to
my
grandfather
-LRB-
though
not
at
the
time
we
are
now
considering
,
*NL*
for
it
was
about
the
date
of
my
own
birth
that
Swann
's
great
`
affair
'
*NL*
began
,
and
made
a
long
interruption
in
his
amatory
practices
-RRB-
the
*NL*
latter
,
recognising
his
friend
's
handwriting
on
the
envelope
,
would
*NL*
exclaim
:
``
Here
is
Swann
asking
for
something
;
on
guard
!
''
And
,
either
*NL*
from
distrust
or
from
the
unconscious
spirit
of
devilry
which
urges
us
*NL*
to
offer
a
thing
only
to
those
who
do
not
want
it
,
my
grandparents
would
*NL*
meet
with
an
obstinate
refusal
the
most
easily
satisfied
of
his
prayers
,
*NL*
as
when
he
begged
them
for
an
introduction
to
a
girl
who
dined
with
us
*NL*
every
Sunday
,
and
whom
they
were
obliged
,
whenever
Swann
mentioned
her
,
*NL*
to
pretend
that
they
no
longer
saw
,
although
they
would
be
wondering
,
*NL*
all
through
the
week
,
whom
they
could
invite
to
meet
her
,
and
often
*NL*
failed
,
in
the
end
,
to
find
anyone
,
sooner
than
make
a
sign
to
him
who
*NL*
would
so
gladly
have
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
a
couple
of
my
grandparents
'
acquaintance
,
who
had
been
*NL*
complaining
for
some
time
that
they
never
saw
Swann
now
,
would
announce
*NL*
with
satisfaction
,
and
perhaps
with
a
slight
inclination
to
make
my
*NL*
grandparents
envious
of
them
,
that
he
had
suddenly
become
as
charming
as
*NL*
he
could
possibly
be
,
and
was
never
out
of
their
house
.
My
grandfather
*NL*
would
not
care
to
shatter
their
pleasant
illusion
,
but
would
look
at
my
*NL*
grandmother
,
as
he
hummed
the
air
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
this
mystery
?
*NL*
I
can
not
understand
it
;
*NL*
*NL*
or
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vision
fugitive
...
;
*NL*
In
matters
such
as
this
*NL*
'T
is
best
to
close
one
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
months
later
,
if
my
grandfather
asked
Swann
's
new
friend
``
What
*NL*
about
Swann
?
Do
you
still
see
as
much
of
him
as
ever
?
''
the
other
's
face
*NL*
would
lengthen
:
``
Never
mention
his
name
to
me
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
that
you
were
such
friends
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
intimate
in
this
way
for
several
months
with
some
cousins
*NL*
of
my
grandmother
,
dining
almost
every
evening
at
their
house
.
Suddenly
,
*NL*
and
without
any
warning
,
he
ceased
to
appear
.
They
supposed
him
to
be
*NL*
ill
,
and
the
lady
of
the
house
was
going
to
send
to
inquire
for
him
*NL*
when
,
in
her
kitchen
,
she
found
a
letter
in
his
hand
,
which
her
cook
had
*NL*
left
by
accident
in
the
housekeeping
book
.
In
this
he
announced
that
he
*NL*
was
leaving
Paris
and
would
not
be
able
to
come
to
the
house
again
.
The
*NL*
cook
had
been
his
mistress
,
and
at
the
moment
of
breaking
off
relations
*NL*
she
was
the
only
one
of
the
household
whom
he
had
thought
it
necessary
*NL*
to
inform
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
his
mistress
for
the
time
being
was
a
woman
in
society
,
or
at
*NL*
least
one
whose
birth
was
not
so
lowly
,
nor
her
position
so
irregular
*NL*
that
he
was
unable
to
arrange
for
her
reception
in
`
society
,
'
then
for
*NL*
her
sake
he
would
return
to
it
,
but
only
to
the
particular
orbit
in
*NL*
which
she
moved
or
into
which
he
had
drawn
her
.
``
No
good
depending
on
*NL*
Swann
for
this
evening
,
''
people
would
say
;
``
do
n't
you
remember
,
it
's
his
*NL*
American
's
night
at
the
Opera
?
''
He
would
secure
invitations
for
her
to
*NL*
the
most
exclusive
drawing-rooms
,
to
those
houses
where
he
himself
*NL*
went
regularly
,
for
weekly
dinners
or
for
poker
;
every
evening
,
after
*NL*
a
slight
`
wave
'
imparted
to
his
stiffly
brushed
red
locks
had
tempered
*NL*
with
a
certain
softness
the
ardour
of
his
bold
green
eyes
,
he
would
*NL*
select
a
flower
for
his
buttonhole
and
set
out
to
meet
his
mistress
at
*NL*
the
house
of
one
or
other
of
the
women
of
his
circle
;
and
then
,
thinking
*NL*
of
the
affection
and
admiration
which
the
fashionable
folk
,
whom
he
*NL*
always
treated
exactly
as
he
pleased
,
would
,
when
he
met
them
there
,
*NL*
lavish
upon
him
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
whom
he
loved
,
he
would
*NL*
find
a
fresh
charm
in
that
worldly
existence
of
which
he
had
grown
*NL*
weary
,
but
whose
substance
,
pervaded
and
warmly
coloured
by
the
*NL*
flickering
light
which
he
had
slipped
into
its
midst
,
seemed
to
him
*NL*
beautiful
and
rare
,
now
that
he
had
incorporated
in
it
a
fresh
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
each
of
these
attachments
,
each
of
these
flirtations
had
been
*NL*
the
realisation
,
more
or
less
complete
,
of
a
dream
born
of
the
sight
of
*NL*
a
face
or
a
form
which
Swann
had
spontaneously
,
and
without
effort
on
*NL*
his
part
,
found
charming
,
it
was
quite
another
matter
when
,
one
day
at
*NL*
the
theatre
,
he
was
introduced
to
Odette
de
Cr√©cy
by
an
old
friend
of
*NL*
his
own
,
who
had
spoken
of
her
to
him
as
a
ravishing
creature
with
whom
*NL*
he
might
very
possibly
come
to
an
understanding
;
but
had
made
her
out
*NL*
to
be
harder
of
conquest
than
she
actually
was
,
so
as
to
appear
to
be
*NL*
conferring
a
special
favour
by
the
introduction
.
She
had
struck
Swann
*NL*
not
,
certainly
,
as
being
devoid
of
beauty
,
but
as
endowed
with
a
style
*NL*
of
beauty
which
left
him
indifferent
,
which
aroused
in
him
no
desire
,
*NL*
which
gave
him
,
indeed
,
a
sort
of
physical
repulsion
;
as
one
of
those
*NL*
women
of
whom
every
man
can
name
some
,
and
each
will
name
different
*NL*
examples
,
who
are
the
converse
of
the
type
which
our
senses
demand
.
To
*NL*
give
him
any
pleasure
her
profile
was
too
sharp
,
her
skin
too
delicate
,
*NL*
her
cheek-bones
too
prominent
,
her
features
too
tightly
drawn
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
were
fine
,
but
so
large
that
they
seemed
to
be
bending
beneath
their
own
*NL*
weight
,
strained
the
rest
of
her
face
and
always
made
her
appear
unwell
*NL*
or
in
an
ill
humour
.
Some
time
after
this
introduction
at
the
theatre
*NL*
she
had
written
to
ask
Swann
whether
she
might
see
his
collections
,
*NL*
which
would
interest
her
so
much
,
she
,
``
an
ignorant
woman
with
a
taste
*NL*
for
beautiful
things
,
''
saying
that
she
would
know
him
better
when
*NL*
once
she
had
seen
him
in
his
`
home
,
'
where
she
imagined
him
to
be
``
so
*NL*
comfortable
with
his
tea
and
his
books
''
;
although
she
had
not
concealed
*NL*
her
surprise
at
his
being
in
that
part
of
the
town
,
which
must
be
so
*NL*
depressing
,
and
was
``
not
nearly
smart
enough
for
such
a
very
smart
man
.
''
*NL*
And
when
he
allowed
her
to
come
she
had
said
to
him
as
she
left
how
*NL*
sorry
she
was
to
have
stayed
so
short
a
time
in
a
house
into
which
she
*NL*
was
so
glad
to
have
found
her
way
at
last
,
speaking
of
him
as
though
he
*NL*
had
meant
something
more
to
her
than
the
rest
of
the
people
she
knew
,
*NL*
and
appearing
to
unite
their
two
selves
with
a
kind
of
romantic
bond
*NL*
which
had
made
him
smile
.
But
at
the
time
of
life
,
tinged
already
with
*NL*
disenchantment
,
which
Swann
was
approaching
,
when
a
man
can
content
*NL*
himself
with
being
in
love
for
the
pleasure
of
loving
without
expecting
*NL*
too
much
in
return
,
this
linking
of
hearts
,
if
it
is
no
longer
,
as
in
*NL*
early
youth
,
the
goal
towards
which
love
,
of
necessity
,
tends
,
still
*NL*
is
bound
to
love
by
so
strong
an
association
of
ideas
that
it
may
well
*NL*
become
the
cause
of
love
if
it
presents
itself
first
.
In
his
younger
*NL*
days
a
man
dreams
of
possessing
the
heart
of
the
woman
whom
he
loves
;
*NL*
later
,
the
feeling
that
he
possesses
the
heart
of
a
woman
may
be
enough
*NL*
to
make
him
fall
in
love
with
her
.
And
50
,
at
an
age
when
it
would
*NL*
appear
--
since
one
seeks
in
love
before
everything
else
a
subjective
*NL*
pleasure
--
that
the
taste
for
feminine
beauty
must
play
the
larger
part
*NL*
in
its
procreation
,
love
may
come
into
being
,
love
of
the
most
physical
*NL*
order
,
without
any
foundation
in
desire
.
At
this
time
of
life
a
man
has
*NL*
already
been
wounded
more
than
once
by
the
darts
of
love
;
it
no
longer
*NL*
evolves
by
itself
,
obeying
its
own
incomprehensible
and
fatal
laws
,
*NL*
before
his
passive
and
astonished
heart
.
We
come
to
its
aid
;
we
falsify
*NL*
it
by
memory
and
by
suggestion
;
recognising
one
of
its
symptoms
we
*NL*
recall
and
recreate
the
rest
.
Since
we
possess
its
hymn
,
engraved
on
*NL*
our
hearts
in
its
entirety
,
there
is
no
need
of
any
woman
to
repeat
the
*NL*
opening
lines
,
potent
with
the
admiration
which
her
beauty
inspires
,
for
*NL*
us
to
remember
all
that
follows
.
And
if
she
begin
in
the
middle
,
where
*NL*
it
sings
of
our
existing
,
henceforward
,
for
one
another
only
,
we
are
*NL*
well
enough
attuned
to
that
music
to
be
able
to
take
it
up
and
follow
*NL*
our
partner
,
without
hesitation
,
at
the
first
pause
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Odette
de
Cr√©cy
came
again
to
see
Swann
;
her
visits
grew
more
frequent
,
*NL*
and
doubtless
each
visit
revived
the
sense
of
disappointment
which
he
*NL*
felt
at
the
sight
of
a
face
whose
details
he
had
somewhat
forgotten
in
*NL*
the
interval
,
not
remembering
it
as
either
so
expressive
or
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
her
youth
,
so
faded
;
he
used
to
regret
,
while
she
was
talking
to
*NL*
him
,
that
her
really
considerable
beauty
was
not
of
the
kind
which
he
*NL*
spontaneously
admired
.
It
must
be
remarked
that
Odette
's
face
appeared
*NL*
thinner
and
more
prominent
than
it
actually
was
,
because
her
forehead
*NL*
and
the
upper
part
of
her
cheeks
,
a
single
and
almost
plane
surface
,
*NL*
were
covered
by
the
masses
of
hair
which
women
wore
at
that
period
,
*NL*
drawn
forward
in
a
fringe
,
raised
in
crimped
waves
and
falling
in
stray
*NL*
locks
over
her
ears
;
while
as
for
her
figure
,
and
she
was
admirably
*NL*
built
,
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
its
continuity
-LRB-
on
account
of
*NL*
the
fashion
then
prevailing
,
and
in
spite
of
her
being
one
of
the
*NL*
best-dressed
women
in
Paris
-RRB-
for
the
corset
,
jetting
forwards
in
an
*NL*
arch
,
as
though
over
an
imaginary
stomach
,
and
ending
in
a
sharp
point
,
*NL*
beneath
which
bulged
out
the
balloon
of
her
double
skirts
,
gave
a
woman
,
*NL*
that
year
,
the
appearance
of
being
composed
of
different
sections
badly
*NL*
fitted
together
;
to
such
an
extent
did
the
frills
,
the
flounces
,
the
*NL*
inner
bodice
follow
,
in
complete
independence
,
controlled
only
by
the
*NL*
fancy
of
their
designer
or
the
rigidity
of
their
material
,
the
line
*NL*
which
led
them
to
the
knots
of
ribbon
,
falls
of
lace
,
fringes
of
*NL*
vertically
hanging
jet
,
or
carried
them
along
the
bust
,
but
nowhere
*NL*
attached
themselves
to
the
living
creature
,
who
,
according
as
the
*NL*
architecture
of
their
fripperies
drew
them
towards
or
away
from
her
*NL*
own
,
found
herself
either
strait-laced
to
suffocation
or
else
completely
*NL*
buried
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
after
Odette
had
left
him
,
Swann
would
think
with
a
smile
of
her
*NL*
telling
him
how
the
time
would
drag
until
he
allowed
her
to
come
again
;
*NL*
he
remembered
the
anxious
,
timid
way
in
which
she
had
once
begged
him
*NL*
that
it
might
not
be
very
long
,
and
the
way
in
which
she
had
looked
at
*NL*
him
then
,
fixing
upon
him
her
fearful
and
imploring
gaze
,
which
gave
her
*NL*
a
touching
air
beneath
the
bunches
of
artificial
pansies
fastened
in
*NL*
the
front
of
her
round
bonnet
of
white
straw
,
tied
with
strings
of
black
*NL*
velvet
.
``
And
wo
n't
you
,
''
she
had
ventured
,
``
come
just
once
and
take
tea
*NL*
with
me
?
''
He
had
pleaded
pressure
of
work
,
an
essay
--
which
,
in
reality
,
*NL*
he
had
abandoned
years
ago
--
on
Vermeer
of
Delft
.
``
I
know
that
I
am
quite
*NL*
useless
,
''
she
had
replied
,
``
a
little
wild
thing
like
me
beside
a
learned
*NL*
great
man
like
you
.
I
should
be
like
the
frog
in
the
fable
!
And
yet
I
*NL*
should
so
much
like
to
learn
,
to
know
things
,
to
be
initiated
.
What
fun
*NL*
it
would
be
to
become
a
regular
bookworm
,
to
bury
my
nose
in
a
lot
of
*NL*
old
papers
!
''
she
had
gone
on
,
with
that
self-satisfied
air
which
a
smart
*NL*
woman
adopts
when
she
insists
that
her
one
desire
is
to
give
herself
*NL*
up
,
without
fear
of
soiling
her
fingers
,
to
some
unclean
task
,
such
as
*NL*
cooking
the
dinner
,
with
her
``
hands
right
in
the
dish
itself
.
''
``
You
will
*NL*
only
laugh
at
me
,
but
this
painter
who
stops
you
from
seeing
me
,
''
she
*NL*
meant
Vermeer
,
``
I
have
never
even
heard
of
him
;
is
he
alive
still
?
Can
I
*NL*
see
any
of
his
things
in
Paris
,
so
as
to
have
some
idea
of
what
is
going
*NL*
on
behind
that
great
brow
which
works
so
hard
,
that
head
which
I
feel
*NL*
sure
is
always
puzzling
away
about
things
;
just
to
be
able
to
say
*NL*
`
There
,
that
's
what
he
's
thinking
about
!
'
What
a
dream
it
would
be
to
be
*NL*
able
to
help
you
with
your
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
sought
an
excuse
in
his
fear
of
forming
new
friendships
,
which
he
*NL*
gallantly
described
as
his
fear
of
a
hopeless
passion
.
``
You
are
afraid
*NL*
of
falling
in
love
?
How
funny
that
is
,
when
I
go
about
seeking
nothing
*NL*
else
,
and
would
give
my
soul
just
to
find
a
little
love
somewhere
!
''
she
*NL*
had
said
,
so
naturally
and
with
such
an
air
of
conviction
that
he
had
*NL*
been
genuinely
touched
.
``
Some
woman
must
have
made
you
suffer
.
And
you
*NL*
think
that
the
rest
are
all
like
her
.
She
ca
n't
have
understood
you
:
you
*NL*
are
so
utterly
different
from
ordinary
men
.
That
's
what
I
liked
about
*NL*
you
when
I
first
saw
you
;
I
felt
at
once
that
you
were
n't
like
everybody
*NL*
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
besides
,
there
's
yourself
--
''
he
had
continued
,
``
I
know
what
*NL*
women
are
;
you
must
have
a
whole
heap
of
things
to
do
,
and
never
any
*NL*
time
to
spare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Why
,
I
have
never
anything
to
do

I
am
always
free
,
and
I
always
*NL*
will
be
free
if
you
want
me
.
At
whatever
hour
of
the
day
or
night
it
may
*NL*
suit
you
to
see
me
,
just
send
for
me
,
and
I
shall
be
only
too
delighted
*NL*
to
come
.
Will
you
do
that
?
Do
you
know
what
I
should
really
like
--
to
*NL*
introduce
you
to
Mme.
Verdurin
,
where
I
go
every
evening
.
Just
fancy
my
*NL*
finding
you
there
,
and
thinking
that
it
was
a
little
for
my
sake
that
*NL*
you
had
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
,
in
thus
remembering
their
conversations
,
in
thinking
about
her
*NL*
thus
when
he
was
alone
,
he
did
no
more
than
call
her
image
into
being
*NL*
among
those
of
countless
other
women
in
his
romantic
dreams
;
but
if
,
*NL*
thanks
to
some
accidental
circumstance
-LRB-
or
even
perhaps
without
that
*NL*
assistance
,
for
the
circumstance
which
presents
itself
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
a
mental
state
,
hitherto
latent
,
makes
itself
felt
,
may
well
have
*NL*
had
no
influence
whatsoever
upon
that
state
-RRB-
,
the
image
of
Odette
de
*NL*
Cr√©cy
came
to
absorb
the
whole
of
his
dreams
,
if
from
those
dreams
*NL*
the
memory
of
her
could
no
longer
be
eliminated
,
then
her
bodily
*NL*
imperfections
would
no
longer
be
of
the
least
importance
,
nor
would
the
*NL*
conformity
of
her
body
,
more
or
less
than
any
other
,
to
the
requirements
*NL*
of
Swann
's
taste
;
since
,
having
become
the
body
of
her
whom
he
loved
,
it
*NL*
must
henceforth
be
the
only
one
capable
of
causing
him
joy
or
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
my
grandfather
had
known
--
which
was
more
than
could
*NL*
be
said
of
any
other
actual
acquaintance
--
the
family
of
these
Verdurins
.
*NL*
But
he
had
entirely
severed
his
connection
with
what
he
called
``
young
*NL*
Verdurin
,
''
taking
a
general
view
of
him
as
one
who
had
fallen
--
though
*NL*
without
losing
hold
of
his
millions
--
among
the
riff-raff
of
Bohemia
.
One
*NL*
day
he
received
a
letter
from
Swann
asking
whether
my
grandfather
could
*NL*
put
him
in
touch
with
the
Verdurins
.
``
On
guard
!
on
guard
!
''
he
exclaimed
*NL*
as
he
read
it
,
``
I
am
not
at
all
surprised
;
Swann
was
bound
to
finish
up
*NL*
like
this
.
A
nice
lot
of
people
!
I
can
not
do
what
he
asks
,
because
,
in
*NL*
the
first
place
,
I
no
longer
know
the
gentleman
in
question
.
Besides
,
*NL*
there
must
be
a
woman
in
it
somewhere
,
and
I
do
n't
mix
myself
up
in
such
*NL*
matters
.
Ah
,
well
,
we
shall
see
some
fun
if
Swann
begins
running
after
*NL*
the
little
Verdurins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
my
grandfather
's
refusal
to
act
as
sponsor
,
it
was
Odette
herself
*NL*
who
had
taken
Swann
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Verdurins
had
had
dining
with
them
,
on
the
day
when
Swann
made
his
*NL*
first
appearance
,
Dr.
and
Mme.
Cottard
,
the
young
pianist
and
his
aunt
,
*NL*
and
the
painter
then
in
favour
,
while
these
were
joined
,
in
the
course
*NL*
of
the
evening
,
by
several
more
of
the
`
faithful
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Cottard
was
never
quite
certain
of
the
tone
in
which
he
ought
to
*NL*
reply
to
any
observation
,
or
whether
the
speaker
was
jesting
or
*NL*
in
earnest
.
And
so
in
any
event
he
would
embellish
all
his
facial
*NL*
expressions
with
the
offer
of
a
conditional
,
a
provisional
smile
whose
*NL*
expectant
subtlety
would
exonerate
him
from
the
charge
of
being
a
*NL*
simpleton
,
if
the
remark
addressed
to
him
should
turn
out
to
have
been
*NL*
facetious
.
But
as
he
must
also
be
prepared
to
face
the
alternative
,
he
*NL*
never
dared
to
allow
this
smile
a
definite
expression
on
his
features
,
*NL*
and
you
would
see
there
a
perpetually
flickering
uncertainty
,
in
which
*NL*
you
might
decipher
the
question
that
he
never
dared
to
ask
:
``
Do
you
*NL*
really
mean
that
?
''
He
was
no
more
confident
of
the
manner
in
which
he
*NL*
ought
to
conduct
himself
in
the
street
,
or
indeed
in
life
generally
,
*NL*
than
he
was
in
a
drawing-room
;
and
he
might
be
seen
greeting
passers-by
,
*NL*
carriages
,
and
anything
that
occurred
with
a
malicious
smile
which
*NL*
absolved
his
subsequent
behaviour
of
all
impropriety
,
since
it
proved
,
*NL*
if
it
should
turn
out
unsuited
to
the
occasion
,
that
he
was
well
aware
*NL*
of
that
,
and
that
if
he
had
assumed
a
smile
,
the
jest
was
a
secret
of
*NL*
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
all
those
points
,
however
,
where
a
plain
question
appeared
to
him
to
*NL*
be
permissible
,
the
Doctor
was
unsparing
in
his
endeavours
to
cultivate
*NL*
the
wilderness
of
his
ignorance
and
uncertainty
and
so
to
complete
his
*NL*
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
that
,
following
the
advice
given
him
by
a
wise
mother
on
his
*NL*
first
coming
up
to
the
capital
from
his
provincial
home
,
he
would
never
*NL*
let
pass
either
a
figure
of
speech
or
a
proper
name
that
was
new
to
him
*NL*
without
an
effort
to
secure
the
fullest
information
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
regards
figures
of
speech
,
he
was
insatiable
in
his
thirst
for
*NL*
knowledge
,
for
often
imagining
them
to
have
a
more
definite
meaning
than
*NL*
was
actually
the
case
,
he
would
want
to
know
what
,
exactly
,
was
intended
*NL*
by
those
which
he
most
frequently
heard
used
:
`
devilish
pretty
,
'
`
blue
*NL*
blood
,
'
'
a
cat
and
dog
life
,
'
'
a
day
of
reckoning
,
'
'
a
queen
of
fashion
,
*NL*
`
to
give
a
free
hand
,
'
`
to
be
at
a
deadlock
,
'
and
so
forth
;
and
in
*NL*
what
particular
circumstances
he
himself
might
make
use
of
them
in
*NL*
conversation
.
Failing
these
,
he
would
adorn
it
with
puns
and
other
*NL*
`
plays
upon
words
'
which
he
had
learned
by
rote
.
As
for
the
names
of
*NL*
strangers
which
were
uttered
in
his
hearing
,
he
used
merely
to
repeat
*NL*
them
to
himself
in
a
questioning
tone
,
which
,
he
thought
,
would
suffice
*NL*
to
furnish
him
with
explanations
for
which
he
would
not
ostensibly
seek
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
critical
faculty
,
on
the
universal
application
of
which
he
prided
*NL*
himself
,
was
,
in
reality
,
completely
lacking
,
that
refinement
of
good
*NL*
breeding
which
consists
in
assuring
some
one
whom
you
are
obliging
in
*NL*
any
way
,
without
expecting
to
be
believed
,
that
it
is
really
yourself
*NL*
that
is
obliged
to
him
,
was
wasted
on
Cottard
,
who
took
everything
that
*NL*
he
heard
in
its
literal
sense
.
However
blind
she
may
have
been
to
his
*NL*
faults
,
Mme.
Verdurin
was
genuinely
annoyed
,
though
she
still
continued
*NL*
to
regard
him
as
brilliantly
clever
,
when
,
after
she
had
invited
him
to
*NL*
see
and
hear
Sarah
Bernhardt
from
a
stage
box
,
and
had
said
politely
:
*NL*
``
It
is
very
good
of
you
to
have
come
,
Doctor
,
especially
as
I
'm
sure
*NL*
you
must
often
have
heard
Sarah
Bernhardt
;
and
besides
,
I
'm
afraid
we
're
*NL*
rather
too
near
the
stage
,
''
the
Doctor
,
who
had
come
into
the
box
with
a
*NL*
smile
which
waited
before
settling
upon
or
vanishing
from
his
face
*NL*
until
some
one
in
authority
should
enlighten
him
as
to
the
merits
of
the
*NL*
spectacle
,
replied
:
``
To
be
sure
,
we
are
far
too
near
the
stage
,
and
*NL*
one
is
getting
sick
of
Sarah
Bernhardt
.
But
you
expressed
a
wish
that
*NL*
I
should
come
.
For
me
,
your
wish
is
a
command
.
I
am
only
too
glad
to
be
*NL*
able
to
do
you
this
little
service
.
What
would
one
not
do
to
please
you
,
*NL*
you
are
so
good
.
''
And
he
went
on
,
``
Sarah
Bernhardt
;
that
's
what
they
*NL*
call
the
Voice
of
God
,
ai
n't
it
?
You
see
,
often
,
too
,
that
she
`
sets
the
*NL*
boards
on
fire
.
'
That
's
an
odd
expression
,
ai
n't
it
?
''
in
the
hope
of
an
*NL*
enlightening
commentary
,
which
,
however
,
was
not
forthcoming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'you
know
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
had
said
to
her
husband
,
``
I
believe
we
are
*NL*
going
the
wrong
way
to
work
when
we
depreciate
anything
we
offer
the
*NL*
Doctor
.
He
is
a
scientist
who
lives
quite
apart
from
our
everyday
*NL*
existence
;
he
knows
nothing
himself
of
what
things
are
worth
,
and
he
*NL*
accepts
everything
that
we
say
as
gospel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
dared
to
mention
it
,
''
M.
Verdurin
had
answered
,
``
but
I
've
*NL*
noticed
the
same
thing
myself
.
''
And
on
the
following
New
Year
's
Day
,
*NL*
instead
of
sending
Dr.
Cottard
a
ruby
that
cost
three
thousand
francs
,
*NL*
and
pretending
that
it
was
a
mere
trifle
,
M.
Verdurin
bought
an
*NL*
artificial
stone
for
three
hundred
,
and
let
it
be
understood
that
it
was
*NL*
something
almost
impossible
to
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mme.
Verdurin
had
announced
that
they
were
to
see
M.
Swann
that
*NL*
evening
;
``
Swann
!
''
the
Doctor
had
exclaimed
in
a
tone
rendered
brutal
*NL*
by
his
astonishment
,
for
the
smallest
piece
of
news
would
always
take
*NL*
utterly
unawares
this
man
who
imagined
himself
to
be
perpetually
in
*NL*
readiness
for
anything
.
And
seeing
that
no
one
answered
him
,
``
Swann
!
Who
*NL*
on
earth
is
Swann
?
''
he
shouted
,
in
a
frenzy
of
anxiety
which
subsided
*NL*
as
soon
as
Mme.
Verdurin
had
explained
,
``
Why
,
Odette
's
friend
,
whom
she
*NL*
told
us
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good
,
good
;
that
's
all
right
,
then
,
''
answered
the
Doctor
,
at
once
*NL*
mollified
.
As
for
the
painter
,
he
was
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
*NL*
Swann
's
appearing
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
because
he
supposed
him
to
be
in
*NL*
love
with
Odette
,
and
was
always
ready
to
assist
at
lovers
'
meetings
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
amuses
me
more
than
match-making
,
''
he
confided
to
Cottard
;
``
I
*NL*
have
been
tremendously
successful
,
even
with
women
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
telling
the
Verdurins
that
Swann
was
extremely
`
smart
,
'
Odette
had
*NL*
alarmed
them
with
the
prospect
of
another
`
bore
.
'
When
he
arrived
,
*NL*
however
,
he
made
an
excellent
impression
,
an
indirect
cause
of
which
,
*NL*
though
they
did
not
know
it
,
was
his
familiarity
with
the
best
society
.
*NL*
He
had
,
indeed
,
one
of
those
advantages
which
men
who
have
lived
and
*NL*
moved
in
the
world
enjoy
over
others
,
even
men
of
intelligence
and
*NL*
refinement
,
who
have
never
gone
into
society
,
namely
that
they
no
longer
*NL*
see
it
transfigured
by
the
longing
or
repulsion
with
which
it
fills
*NL*
the
imagination
,
but
regard
it
as
quite
unimportant
.
Their
good
nature
,
*NL*
freed
from
all
taint
of
snobbishness
and
from
the
fear
of
seeming
*NL*
too
friendly
,
grown
independent
,
in
fact
,
has
the
ease
,
the
grace
of
*NL*
movement
of
a
trained
gymnast
each
of
whose
supple
limbs
will
carry
out
*NL*
precisely
the
movement
that
is
required
without
any
clumsy
participation
*NL*
by
the
rest
of
his
body
.
The
simple
and
elementary
gestures
used
by
a
*NL*
man
of
the
world
when
he
courteously
holds
out
his
hand
to
the
unknown
*NL*
youth
who
is
being
introduced
to
him
,
and
when
he
bows
discreetly
before
*NL*
the
Ambassador
to
whom
he
is
being
introduced
,
had
gradually
pervaded
,
*NL*
without
his
being
conscious
of
it
,
the
whole
of
Swann
's
social
*NL*
deportment
,
so
that
in
the
company
of
people
of
a
lower
grade
than
his
*NL*
own
,
such
as
the
Verdurins
and
their
friends
,
he
instinctively
shewed
an
*NL*
assiduity
,
and
made
overtures
with
which
,
by
their
account
,
any
of
their
*NL*
`
bores
'
would
have
dispensed
.
He
chilled
,
though
for
a
moment
only
,
*NL*
on
meeting
Dr.
Cottard
;
for
seeing
him
close
one
eye
with
an
ambiguous
*NL*
smile
,
before
they
had
yet
spoken
to
one
another
-LRB-
a
grimace
which
*NL*
Cottard
styled
``
letting
'em
all
come
''
-RRB-
,
Swann
supposed
that
the
Doctor
*NL*
recognised
him
from
having
met
him
already
somewhere
,
probably
in
some
*NL*
house
of
`
ill-fame
,
'
though
these
he
himself
very
rarely
visited
,
*NL*
never
having
made
a
habit
of
indulging
in
the
mercenary
sort
of
love
.
*NL*
Regarding
such
an
allusion
as
in
bad
taste
,
especially
before
Odette
,
*NL*
whose
opinion
of
himself
it
might
easily
alter
for
the
worse
,
Swann
*NL*
assumed
his
most
icy
manner
.
But
when
he
learned
that
the
lady
next
to
*NL*
the
Doctor
was
Mme.
Cottard
,
he
decided
that
so
young
a
husband
would
*NL*
not
deliberately
,
in
his
wife
's
hearing
,
have
made
any
allusion
to
*NL*
amusements
of
that
order
,
and
so
ceased
to
interpret
the
Doctor
's
*NL*
expression
in
the
sense
which
he
had
at
first
suspected
.
The
painter
at
*NL*
once
invited
Swann
to
visit
his
studio
with
Odette
,
and
Swann
found
him
*NL*
very
pleasant
.
``
Perhaps
you
will
be
more
highly
favoured
than
I
have
*NL*
been
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
broke
in
,
with
mock
resentment
of
the
favour
,
*NL*
``
perhaps
you
will
be
allowed
to
see
Cottard
's
portrait
''
-LRB-
for
which
she
*NL*
had
given
the
painter
a
commission
-RRB-
.
``
Take
care
,
Master
Biche
,
''
she
*NL*
reminded
the
painter
,
whom
it
was
a
time-honoured
pleasantry
to
address
*NL*
as
`
Master
,
'
``
to
catch
that
nice
look
in
his
eyes
,
that
witty
little
*NL*
twinkle
.
You
know
,
what
I
want
to
have
most
of
all
is
his
smile
;
that
's
*NL*
what
I
've
asked
you
to
paint
--
the
portrait
of
his
smile
.
''
And
since
the
*NL*
phrase
struck
her
as
noteworthy
,
she
repeated
it
very
loud
,
so
as
to
*NL*
make
sure
that
as
many
as
possible
of
her
guests
should
hear
it
,
and
*NL*
even
made
use
of
some
indefinite
pretext
to
draw
the
circle
closer
*NL*
before
she
uttered
it
again
.
Swann
begged
to
be
introduced
to
everyone
,
*NL*
even
to
an
old
friend
of
the
Verdurins
,
called
Saniette
,
whose
shyness
,
*NL*
simplicity
and
good-nature
had
deprived
him
of
all
the
consideration
due
*NL*
to
his
skill
in
palaeography
,
his
large
fortune
,
and
the
distinguished
*NL*
family
to
which
he
belonged
.
When
he
spoke
,
his
words
came
with
*NL*
a
confusion
which
was
delightful
to
hear
because
one
felt
that
it
*NL*
indicated
not
so
much
a
defect
in
his
speech
as
a
quality
of
his
soul
,
*NL*
as
it
were
a
survival
from
the
age
of
innocence
which
he
had
never
*NL*
wholly
outgrown
.
All
the
consonants
which
he
did
not
manage
to
pronounce
*NL*
seemed
like
harsh
utterances
of
which
his
gentle
lips
were
incapable
.
By
*NL*
asking
to
be
made
known
to
M.
Saniette
,
Swann
made
M.
Verdurin
reverse
*NL*
the
usual
form
of
introduction
-LRB-
saying
,
in
fact
,
with
emphasis
on
the
*NL*
distinction
:
``
M.
Swann
,
pray
let
me
present
to
you
our
friend
Saniette
''
-RRB-
*NL*
but
he
aroused
in
Saniette
himself
a
warmth
of
gratitude
,
which
,
*NL*
however
,
the
Verdurins
never
disclosed
to
Swann
,
since
Saniette
rather
*NL*
annoyed
them
,
and
they
did
not
feel
bound
to
provide
him
with
friends
.
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
the
Verdurins
were
extremely
touched
by
Swann
's
next
*NL*
request
,
for
he
felt
that
he
must
ask
to
be
introduced
to
the
pianist
's
*NL*
aunt
.
She
wore
a
black
dress
,
as
was
her
invariable
custom
,
for
she
*NL*
believed
that
a
woman
always
looked
well
in
black
,
and
that
nothing
*NL*
could
be
more
distinguished
;
but
her
face
was
exceedingly
red
,
as
*NL*
it
always
was
for
some
time
after
a
meal
.
She
bowed
to
Swann
with
*NL*
deference
,
but
drew
herself
up
again
with
great
dignity
.
As
she
was
*NL*
entirely
uneducated
,
and
was
afraid
of
making
mistakes
in
grammar
and
*NL*
pronunciation
,
she
used
purposely
to
speak
in
an
indistinct
and
garbling
*NL*
manner
,
thinking
that
if
she
should
make
a
slip
it
would
be
so
buried
in
*NL*
the
surrounding
confusion
that
no
one
could
be
certain
whether
she
had
*NL*
actually
made
it
or
not
;
with
the
result
that
her
talk
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
continuous
,
blurred
expectoration
,
out
of
which
would
emerge
,
at
rare
*NL*
intervals
,
those
sounds
and
syllables
of
which
she
felt
positive
.
*NL*
Swann
supposed
himself
entitled
to
poke
a
little
mild
fun
at
her
in
*NL*
conversation
with
M.
Verdurin
,
who
,
however
,
was
not
at
all
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
such
an
excellent
woman
!
''
he
rejoined
.
``
I
grant
you
that
she
*NL*
is
not
exactly
brilliant
;
but
I
assure
you
that
she
can
talk
most
*NL*
charmingly
when
you
are
alone
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
she
can
,
''
Swann
hastened
to
conciliate
him
.
``
All
I
meant
was
*NL*
that
she
hardly
struck
me
as
`
distinguished
,
'
''
he
went
on
,
isolating
*NL*
the
epithet
in
the
inverted
commas
of
his
tone
,
``
and
,
after
all
,
that
is
*NL*
something
of
a
compliment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
moment
,
''
said
M.
Verdurin
,
``
now
,
this
will
surprise
you
;
she
*NL*
writes
quite
delightfully
.
You
have
never
heard
her
nephew
play
?
It
is
*NL*
admirable
;
eh
,
Doctor
?
Would
you
like
me
to
ask
him
to
play
something
,
*NL*
M.
Swann
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
count
myself
most
fortunate
...
''
Swann
was
beginning
,
a
trifle
*NL*
pompously
,
when
the
Doctor
broke
in
derisively
.
Having
once
heard
it
*NL*
said
,
and
never
having
forgotten
that
in
general
conversation
emphasis
*NL*
and
the
use
of
formal
expressions
were
out
of
date
,
whenever
he
heard
a
*NL*
solemn
word
used
seriously
,
as
the
word
`
fortunate
'
had
been
used
just
*NL*
now
by
Swann
,
he
at
once
assumed
that
the
speaker
was
being
deliberately
*NL*
pedantic
.
And
if
,
moreover
,
the
same
word
happened
to
occur
,
also
,
in
*NL*
what
he
called
an
old
`
tag
'
or
`
saw
,
'
however
common
it
might
still
be
*NL*
in
current
usage
,
the
Doctor
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
whole
*NL*
thing
was
a
joke
,
and
interrupted
with
the
remaining
words
of
the
*NL*
quotation
,
which
he
seemed
to
charge
the
speaker
with
having
intended
*NL*
to
introduce
at
that
point
,
although
in
reality
it
had
never
entered
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
fortunate
for
France
!
''
he
recited
wickedly
,
shooting
up
both
arms
*NL*
with
great
vigour
.
M.
Verdurin
could
not
help
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
all
those
good
people
laughing
at
over
there
?
There
's
no
sign
*NL*
of
brooding
melancholy
down
in
your
corner
,
''
shouted
Mme.
Verdurin
.
``
You
*NL*
do
n't
suppose
I
find
it
very
amusing
to
be
stuck
up
here
by
myself
on
*NL*
the
stool
of
repentance
,
''
she
went
on
peevishly
,
like
a
spoiled
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
was
sitting
upon
a
high
Swedish
chair
of
waxed
pine-wood
,
*NL*
which
a
violinist
from
that
country
had
given
her
,
and
which
she
kept
in
*NL*
her
drawing-room
,
although
in
appearance
it
suggested
a
school
`
form
,
'
*NL*
and
`
swore
,
'
as
the
saying
is
,
at
the
really
good
antique
furniture
*NL*
which
she
had
besides
;
but
she
made
a
point
of
keeping
on
view
the
*NL*
presents
which
her
`
faithful
'
were
in
the
habit
of
making
her
from
time
*NL*
to
time
,
so
that
the
donors
might
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
there
*NL*
when
they
came
to
the
house
.
She
tried
to
persuade
them
to
confine
*NL*
their
tributes
to
flowers
and
sweets
,
which
had
at
least
the
merit
of
*NL*
mortality
;
but
she
was
never
successful
,
and
the
house
was
gradually
*NL*
filled
with
a
collection
of
foot-warmers
,
cushions
,
clocks
,
screens
,
*NL*
barometers
and
vases
,
a
constant
repetition
and
a
boundless
incongruity
*NL*
of
useless
but
indestructible
objects
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
lofty
perch
she
would
take
her
spirited
part
in
the
*NL*
conversation
of
the
`
faithful
,
'
and
would
revel
in
all
their
fun
;
but
,
*NL*
since
the
accident
to
her
jaw
,
she
had
abandoned
the
effort
involved
in
*NL*
real
hilarity
,
and
had
substituted
a
kind
of
symbolical
dumb-show
which
*NL*
signified
,
without
endangering
or
even
fatiguing
her
in
any
way
,
that
*NL*
she
was
`
laughing
until
she
cried
.
'
At
the
least
witticism
aimed
by
any
*NL*
of
the
circle
against
a
`
bore
,
'
or
against
a
former
member
of
the
circle
*NL*
who
was
now
relegated
to
the
limbo
of
`
bores
'
--
and
to
the
utter
despair
*NL*
of
M.
Verdurin
,
who
had
always
made
out
that
he
was
just
as
easily
*NL*
amused
as
his
wife
,
but
who
,
since
his
laughter
was
the
`
real
thing
,
'
*NL*
was
out
of
breath
in
a
moment
,
and
so
was
overtaken
and
vanquished
*NL*
by
her
device
of
a
feigned
but
continuous
hilarity
--
she
would
utter
a
*NL*
shrill
cry
,
shut
tight
her
little
bird-like
eyes
,
which
were
beginning
*NL*
to
be
clouded
over
by
a
cataract
,
and
quickly
,
as
though
she
had
only
*NL*
just
time
to
avoid
some
indecent
sight
or
to
parry
a
mortal
blow
,
*NL*
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
,
which
completely
engulfed
it
,
and
*NL*
prevented
her
from
seeing
anything
at
all
,
she
would
appear
to
be
*NL*
struggling
to
suppress
,
to
eradicate
a
laugh
which
,
were
she
to
give
*NL*
way
to
it
,
must
inevitably
leave
her
inanimate
.
So
,
stupefied
with
*NL*
the
gaiety
of
the
`
faithful
,
'
drunken
with
comradeship
,
scandal
and
*NL*
asseveration
,
Mme.
Verdurin
,
perched
on
her
high
seat
like
a
cage-bird
*NL*
whose
biscuit
has
been
steeped
in
mulled
wine
,
would
sit
aloft
and
sob
*NL*
with
fellow-feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
M.
Verdurin
,
after
first
asking
Swann
's
permission
to
light
*NL*
his
pipe
-LRB-
``
No
ceremony
here
,
you
understand
;
we
're
all
pals
!
''
-RRB-
,
went
and
*NL*
begged
the
young
musician
to
sit
down
at
the
piano
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
him
alone
;
do
n't
bother
him
;
he
has
n't
come
here
to
be
*NL*
tormented
,
''
cried
Mme.
Verdurin
.
``
I
wo
n't
have
him
tormented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
on
earth
should
it
bother
him
?
''
rejoined
M.
Verdurin
.
``
I
'm
sure
*NL*
M.
Swann
has
never
heard
the
sonata
in
F
sharp
which
we
discovered
;
he
*NL*
is
going
to
play
us
the
pianoforte
arrangement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
not
my
sonata
!
''
she
screamed
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
be
made
to
*NL*
cry
until
I
get
a
cold
in
the
head
,
and
neuralgia
all
down
my
face
,
like
*NL*
last
time
;
thanks
very
much
,
I
do
n't
intend
to
repeat
that
performance
;
*NL*
you
are
all
very
kind
and
considerate
;
it
is
easy
to
see
that
none
of
*NL*
you
will
have
to
stay
in
bed
,
for
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
scene
,
which
was
re-enacted
as
often
as
the
young
pianist
*NL*
sat
down
to
play
,
never
failed
to
delight
the
audience
,
as
though
*NL*
each
of
them
were
witnessing
it
for
the
first
time
,
as
a
proof
of
the
*NL*
seductive
originality
of
the
`
Mistress
'
as
she
was
styled
,
and
of
the
*NL*
acute
sensitiveness
of
her
musical
`
ear
.
'
Those
nearest
to
her
would
*NL*
attract
the
attention
of
the
rest
,
who
were
smoking
or
playing
cards
at
*NL*
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
by
their
cries
of
`
Hear
,
hear
!
'
which
,
as
*NL*
in
Parliamentary
debates
,
shewed
that
something
worth
listening
to
was
*NL*
being
said
.
And
next
day
they
would
commiserate
with
those
who
had
*NL*
been
prevented
from
coming
that
evening
,
and
would
assure
them
that
the
*NL*
`
little
scene
'
had
never
been
so
amusingly
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
right
,
then
,
''
said
M.
Verdurin
,
``
he
can
play
just
the
*NL*
andante
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
the
_
andante
_
!
How
you
do
go
on
,
''
cried
his
wife
.
``
As
if
it
*NL*
were
n't
`
just
the
_
andante
_
'
that
breaks
every
bone
in
my
body
.
The
*NL*
`
Master
'
is
really
too
priceless
!
Just
as
though
,
`
in
the
Ninth
,
'
he
*NL*
said
`
we
need
only
have
the
_
finale
_
,
'
or
`
just
the
overture
'
of
the
*NL*
_
Meistersinger
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
,
however
,
urged
Mme.
Verdurin
to
let
the
pianist
play
,
*NL*
not
because
he
supposed
her
to
be
malingering
when
she
spoke
of
the
*NL*
distressing
effects
that
music
always
had
upon
her
,
for
he
recognised
*NL*
the
existence
of
certain
neurasthenic
states
--
but
from
his
habit
,
common
*NL*
to
many
doctors
,
of
at
once
relaxing
the
strict
letter
of
a
prescription
*NL*
as
soon
as
it
appeared
to
jeopardise
,
what
seemed
to
him
far
more
*NL*
important
,
the
success
of
some
social
gathering
at
which
he
was
present
,
*NL*
and
of
which
the
patient
whom
he
had
urged
for
once
to
forget
her
*NL*
dyspepsia
or
headache
formed
an
essential
factor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
be
ill
this
time
,
you
'll
find
,
''
he
told
her
,
seeking
at
the
*NL*
same
time
to
subdue
her
mind
by
the
magnetism
of
his
gaze
.
``
And
,
if
you
*NL*
are
ill
,
we
will
cure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
,
really
?
''
Mme.
Verdurin
spoke
as
though
,
with
so
great
a
*NL*
favour
in
store
for
her
,
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
capitulate
.
*NL*
Perhaps
,
too
,
by
dint
of
saying
that
she
was
going
to
be
ill
,
she
had
*NL*
worked
herself
into
a
state
in
which
she
forgot
,
occasionally
,
that
it
*NL*
was
all
only
a
`
little
scene
,
'
and
regarded
things
,
quite
sincerely
,
*NL*
from
an
invalid
's
point
of
view
.
For
it
may
often
be
remarked
that
*NL*
invalids
grow
weary
of
having
the
frequency
of
their
attacks
depend
*NL*
always
on
their
own
prudence
in
avoiding
them
,
and
like
to
let
*NL*
themselves
think
that
they
are
free
to
do
everything
that
they
most
*NL*
enjoy
doing
,
although
they
are
always
ill
after
doing
it
,
provided
only
*NL*
that
they
place
themselves
in
the
hands
of
a
higher
authority
which
,
*NL*
without
putting
them
to
the
least
inconvenience
,
can
and
will
,
by
*NL*
uttering
a
word
or
by
administering
a
tabloid
,
set
them
once
again
upon
*NL*
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Odette
had
gone
to
sit
on
a
tapestry-covered
sofa
near
the
piano
,
saying
*NL*
to
Mme.
Verdurin
,
``
I
have
my
own
little
corner
,
have
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mme.
Verdurin
,
seeing
Swann
by
himself
upon
a
chair
,
made
him
get
*NL*
up
.
``
You
're
not
at
all
comfortable
there
;
go
along
and
sit
by
Odette
;
*NL*
you
can
make
room
for
M.
Swann
there
,
ca
n't
you
,
Odette
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
charming
Beauvais
!
''
said
Swann
,
stopping
to
admire
the
sofa
before
*NL*
he
sat
down
on
it
,
and
wishing
to
be
polite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
appreciate
my
sofa
,
''
replied
Mme.
Verdurin
,
``
and
I
warn
*NL*
you
that
if
you
expect
ever
to
see
another
like
it
you
may
as
well
*NL*
abandon
the
idea
at
once
.
They
never
made
any
more
like
it
.
And
these
*NL*
little
chairs
,
too
,
are
perfect
marvels
.
You
can
look
at
them
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
The
emblems
in
each
of
the
bronze
mouldings
correspond
to
the
*NL*
subject
of
the
tapestry
on
the
chair
;
you
know
,
you
combine
amusement
*NL*
with
instruction
when
you
look
at
them
;
--
I
can
promise
you
a
delightful
*NL*
time
,
I
assure
you
.
Just
look
at
the
little
border
around
the
edges
;
*NL*
here
,
look
,
the
little
vine
on
a
red
background
in
this
one
,
the
Bear
*NL*
and
the
Grapes
.
Is
n't
it
well
drawn
?
What
do
you
say
?
I
think
they
knew
*NL*
a
thing
or
two
about
design
!
Does
n't
it
make
your
mouth
water
,
this
*NL*
vine
?
My
husband
makes
out
that
I
am
not
fond
of
fruit
,
because
I
eat
*NL*
less
than
he
does
.
But
not
a
bit
of
it
,
I
am
greedier
than
any
of
you
,
*NL*
but
I
have
no
need
to
fill
my
mouth
with
them
when
I
can
feed
on
them
*NL*
with
my
eyes
.
What
are
you
all
laughing
at
now
,
pray
?
Ask
the
Doctor
;
*NL*
he
will
tell
you
that
those
grapes
act
on
me
like
a
regular
purge
.
Some
*NL*
people
go
to
Fontainebleau
for
cures
;
I
take
my
own
little
Beauvais
cure
*NL*
here
.
But
,
M.
Swann
,
you
must
n't
run
away
without
feeling
the
little
*NL*
bronze
mouldings
on
the
backs
.
Is
n't
it
an
exquisite
surface
?
No
,
no
,
*NL*
not
with
your
whole
hand
like
that
;
feel
them
properly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Mme.
Verdurin
is
going
to
start
playing
about
with
her
bronzes
,
''
*NL*
said
the
painter
,
``
we
sha

any

*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet

is
no
flesh
in
*NL*
the
world
as
soft
as
these
.
None
.
When
M.
Verdurin
did
me
the
honour
*NL*
of
being
madly
jealous
...
come
,
you
might
at
least
be
polite
.
Do
n't
say
*NL*
that
you
never
have
been
jealous
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
,
I
have
said
absolutely
nothing
.
Look
here
,
Doctor
,
I
call
*NL*
you
as
a
witness
;
did
I
utter
a
word
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
had
begun
,
out
of
politeness
,
to
finger
the
bronzes
,
and
did
not
*NL*
like
to
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
;
you
can
caress
them
later
;
now
it
is
you
that
are
going
to
*NL*
be
caressed
,
caressed
in
the
ear
;
you
'll
like
that
,
I
think
.
Here
's
the
*NL*
young
gentleman
who
will
take
charge
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
pianist
had
played
,
Swann
felt
and
shewed
more
interest
in
him
*NL*
than
in
any
of
the
other
guests
,
for
the
following
reason
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
year
before
,
at
an
evening
party
,
he
had
heard
a
piece
of
music
*NL*
played
on
the
piano
and
violin
.
At
first
he
had
appreciated
only
the
*NL*
material
quality
of
the
sounds
which
those
instruments
secreted
.
And
it
*NL*
had
been
a
source
of
keen
pleasure
when
,
below
the
narrow
ribbon
of
the
*NL*
violin-part
,
delicate
,
unyielding
,
substantial
and
governing
the
whole
,
*NL*
he
had
suddenly
perceived
,
where
it
was
trying
to
surge
upwards
in
a
*NL*
flowing
tide
of
sound
,
the
mass
of
the
piano-part
,
multiform
,
coherent
,
*NL*
level
,
and
breaking
everywhere
in
melody
like
the
deep
blue
tumult
of
*NL*
the
sea
,
silvered
and
charmed
into
a
minor
key
by
the
moonlight
.
But
at
*NL*
a
given
moment
,
without
being
able
to
distinguish
any
clear
outline
,
*NL*
or
to
give
a
name
to
what
was
pleasing
him
,
suddenly
enraptured
,
he
had
*NL*
tried
to
collect
,
to
treasure
in
his
memory
the
phrase
or
harmony
--
he
*NL*
knew
not
which
--
that
had
just
been
played
,
and
had
opened
and
expanded
*NL*
his
soul
,
just
as
the
fragrance
of
certain
roses
,
wafted
upon
the
moist
*NL*
air
of
evening
,
has
the
power
of
dilating
our
nostrils
.
Perhaps
it
was
*NL*
owing
to
his
own
ignorance
of
music
that
he
had
been
able
to
receive
so
*NL*
confused
an
impression
,
one
of
those
that
are
,
notwithstanding
,
our
only
*NL*
purely
musical
impressions
,
limited
in
their
extent
,
entirely
original
,
*NL*
and
irreducible
into
any
other
kind
.
An
impression
of
this
order
,
*NL*
vanishing
in
an
instant
,
is
,
so
to
speak
,
an
impression
_
sine
materia
_
.
*NL*
Presumably
the
notes
which
we
hear
at
such
moments
tend
to
spread
out
*NL*
before
our
eyes
,
over
surfaces
greater
or
smaller
according
to
their
*NL*
pitch
and
volume
;
to
trace
arabesque
designs
,
to
give
us
the
sensation
*NL*
of
breadth
or
tenuity
,
stability
or
caprice
.
But
the
notes
themselves
*NL*
have
vanished
before
these
sensations
have
developed
sufficiently
to
*NL*
escape
submersion
under
those
which
the
following
,
or
even
simultaneous
*NL*
notes
have
already
begun
to
awaken
in
us
.
And
this
indefinite
perception
*NL*
would
continue
to
smother
in
its
molten
liquidity
the
_
motifs
_
which
now
*NL*
and
then
emerge
,
barely
discernible
,
to
plunge
again
and
disappear
and
*NL*
drown
;
recognised
only
by
the
particular
kind
of
pleasure
which
they
*NL*
instil
,
impossible
to
describe
,
to
recollect
,
to
name
;
ineffable
;
--
if
*NL*
our
memory
,
like
a
labourer
who
toils
at
the
laying
down
of
firm
*NL*
foundations
beneath
the
tumult
of
the
waves
,
did
not
,
by
fashioning
for
*NL*
us
facsimiles
of
those
fugitive
phrases
,
enable
us
to
compare
and
to
*NL*
contrast
them
with
those
that
follow
.
And
so
,
hardly
had
the
delicious
*NL*
sensation
,
which
Swann
had
experienced
,
died
away
,
before
his
memory
*NL*
had
furnished
him
with
an
immediate
transcript
,
summary
,
it
is
true
,
*NL*
and
provisional
,
but
one
on
which
he
had
kept
his
eyes
fixed
while
*NL*
the
playing
continued
,
so
effectively
that
,
when
the
same
impression
*NL*
suddenly
returned
,
it
was
no
longer
uncapturable
.
He
was
able
to
picture
*NL*
to
himself
its
extent
,
its
symmetrical
arrangement
,
its
notation
,
the
*NL*
strength
of
its
expression
;
he
had
before
him
that
definite
object
which
*NL*
was
no
longer
pure
music
,
but
rather
design
,
architecture
,
thought
,
*NL*
and
which
allowed
the
actual
music
to
be
recalled
.
This
time
he
had
*NL*
distinguished
,
quite
clearly
,
a
phrase
which
emerged
for
a
few
moments
*NL*
from
the
waves
of
sound
.
It
had
at
once
held
out
to
him
an
invitation
to
*NL*
partake
of
intimate
pleasures
,
of
whose
existence
,
before
hearing
it
,
he
*NL*
had
never
dreamed
,
into
which
he
felt
that
nothing
but
this
phrase
could
*NL*
initiate
him
;
and
he
had
been
filled
with
love
for
it
,
as
with
a
new
and
*NL*
strange
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
slow
and
rhythmical
movement
it
led
him
here
,
there
,
everywhere
,
*NL*
towards
a
state
of
happiness
noble
,
unintelligible
,
yet
clearly
*NL*
indicated
.
And
then
,
suddenly
having
reached
a
certain
point
from
which
*NL*
he
was
prepared
to
follow
it
,
after
pausing
for
a
moment
,
abruptly
it
*NL*
changed
its
direction
,
and
in
a
fresh
movement
,
more
rapid
,
multiform
,
*NL*
melancholy
,
incessant
,
sweet
,
it
bore
him
off
with
it
towards
a
vista
*NL*
of
joys
unknown
.
Then
it
vanished
.
He
hoped
,
with
a
passionate
longing
,
*NL*
that
he
might
find
it
again
,
a
third
time
.
And
reappear
it
did
,
though
*NL*
without
speaking
to
him
more
clearly
,
bringing
him
,
indeed
,
a
pleasure
*NL*
less
profound
.
But
when
he
was
once
more
at
home
he
needed
it
,
he
*NL*
was
like
a
man
into
whose
life
a
woman
,
whom
he
has
seen
for
a
moment
*NL*
passing
by
,
has
brought
a
new
form
of
beauty
,
which
strengthens
and
*NL*
enlarges
his
own
power
of
perception
,
without
his
knowing
even
whether
*NL*
he
is
ever
to
see
her
again
whom
he
loves
already
,
although
he
knows
*NL*
nothing
of
her
,
not
even
her
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
this
passion
for
a
phrase
of
music
seemed
,
in
the
first
few
*NL*
months
,
to
be
bringing
into
Swann
's
life
the
possibility
of
a
sort
of
*NL*
rejuvenation
.
He
had
so
long
since
ceased
to
direct
his
course
towards
*NL*
any
ideal
goal
,
and
had
confined
himself
to
the
pursuit
of
ephemeral
*NL*
satisfactions
,
that
he
had
come
to
believe
,
though
without
ever
formally
*NL*
stating
his
belief
even
to
himself
,
that
he
would
remain
all
his
life
in
*NL*
that
condition
,
which
death
alone
could
alter
.
More
than
this
,
since
his
*NL*
mind
no
longer
entertained
any
lofty
ideals
,
he
had
ceased
to
believe
*NL*
in
-LRB-
although
he
could
not
have
expressly
denied
-RRB-
their
reality
.
He
had
*NL*
grown
also
into
the
habit
of
taking
refuge
in
trivial
considerations
,
*NL*
which
allowed
him
to
set
on
one
side
matters
of
fundamental
importance
.
*NL*
Just
as
he
had
never
stopped
to
ask
himself
whether
he
would
not
have
*NL*
done
better
by
not
going
into
society
,
knowing
very
well
that
if
he
*NL*
had
accepted
an
invitation
he
must
put
in
an
appearance
,
and
that
*NL*
afterwards
,
if
he
did
not
actually
call
,
he
must
at
least
leave
cards
*NL*
upon
his
hostess
;
so
in
his
conversation
he
took
care
never
to
express
*NL*
with
any
warmth
a
personal
opinion
about
a
thing
,
but
instead
would
*NL*
supply
facts
and
details
which
had
a
value
of
a
sort
in
themselves
,
and
*NL*
excused
him
from
shewing
how
much
he
really
knew
.
He
would
be
extremely
*NL*
precise
about
the
recipe
for
a
dish
,
the
dates
of
a
painter
's
birth
and
*NL*
death
,
and
the
titles
of
his
works
.
Sometimes
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
he
*NL*
would
let
himself
go
so
far
as
to
utter
a
criticism
of
a
work
of
art
,
or
*NL*
of
some
one
's
interpretation
of
life
,
but
then
he
would
cloak
his
words
*NL*
in
a
tone
of
irony
,
as
though
he
did
not
altogether
associate
himself
*NL*
with
what
he
was
saying
.
But
now
,
like
a
confirmed
invalid
whom
,
all
*NL*
of
a
sudden
,
a
change
of
air
and
surroundings
,
or
a
new
course
of
*NL*
treatment
,
or
,
as
sometimes
happens
,
an
organic
change
in
himself
,
*NL*
spontaneous
and
unaccountable
,
seems
to
have
so
far
recovered
from
his
*NL*
malady
that
he
begins
to
envisage
the
possibility
,
hitherto
beyond
*NL*
all
hope
,
of
starting
to
lead
--
and
better
late
than
never
--
a
wholly
*NL*
different
life
,
Swann
found
in
himself
,
in
the
memory
of
the
phrase
that
*NL*
he
had
heard
,
in
certain
other
sonatas
which
he
had
made
people
play
*NL*
over
to
him
,
to
see
whether
he
might
not
,
perhaps
,
discover
his
phrase
*NL*
among
them
,
the
presence
of
one
of
those
invisible
realities
in
which
*NL*
he
had
ceased
to
believe
,
but
to
which
,
as
though
the
music
had
had
upon
*NL*
the
moral
barrenness
from
which
he
was
suffering
a
sort
of
recreative
*NL*
influence
,
he
was
conscious
once
again
of
a
desire
,
almost
,
indeed
,
of
*NL*
the
power
to
consecrate
his
life
.
But
,
never
having
managed
to
find
out
*NL*
whose
work
it
was
that
he
had
heard
played
that
evening
,
he
had
been
*NL*
unable
to
procure
a
copy
,
and
finally
had
forgotten
the
quest
.
He
had
*NL*
indeed
,
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
,
encountered
several
of
the
*NL*
people
who
had
been
at
the
party
with
him
,
and
had
questioned
them
;
*NL*
but
most
of
them
had
either
arrived
after
or
left
before
the
piece
was
*NL*
played
;
some
had
indeed
been
in
the
house
,
but
had
gone
into
another
*NL*
room
to
talk
,
and
those
who
had
stayed
to
listen
had
no
clearer
*NL*
impression
than
the
rest
.
As
for
his
hosts
,
they
knew
that
it
was
a
*NL*
recently
published
work
which
the
musicians
whom
they
had
engaged
for
*NL*
the
evening
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
play
;
but
,
as
these
last
were
now
*NL*
on
tour
somewhere
,
Swann
could
learn
nothing
further
.
He
had
,
of
*NL*
course
,
a
number
of
musical
friends
,
but
,
vividly
as
he
could
recall
the
*NL*
exquisite
and
inexpressible
pleasure
which
the
little
phrase
had
given
*NL*
him
,
and
could
see
,
still
,
before
his
eyes
the
forms
that
it
had
traced
*NL*
in
outline
,
he
was
quite
incapable
of
humming
over
to
them
the
air
.
And
*NL*
so
,
at
last
,
he
ceased
to
think
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to-night
,
at
Mme.
Verdurin
's
,
scarcely
had
the
little
pianist
begun
*NL*
to
play
when
,
suddenly
,
after
a
high
note
held
on
through
two
whole
*NL*
bars
,
Swann
saw
it
approaching
,
stealing
forth
from
underneath
that
*NL*
resonance
,
which
was
prolonged
and
stretched
out
over
it
,
like
a
curtain
*NL*
of
sound
,
to
veil
the
mystery
of
its
birth
--
and
recognised
,
secret
,
*NL*
whispering
,
articulate
,
the
airy
and
fragrant
phrase
that
he
had
loved
.
*NL*
And
it
was
so
peculiarly
itself
,
it
had
so
personal
a
charm
,
which
*NL*
nothing
else
could
have
replaced
,
that
Swann
felt
as
though
he
had
met
,
*NL*
in
a
friend
's
drawing-room
,
a
woman
whom
he
had
seen
and
admired
,
once
,
*NL*
in
the
street
,
and
had
despaired
of
ever
seeing
her
again
.
Finally
the
*NL*
phrase
withdrew
and
vanished
,
pointing
,
directing
,
diligent
among
the
*NL*
wandering
currents
of
its
fragrance
,
leaving
upon
Swann
's
features
a
*NL*
reflection
of
its
smile
.
But
now
,
at
last
,
he
could
ask
the
name
of
*NL*
his
fair
unknown
-LRB-
and
was
told
that
it
was
the
_
andante
_
movement
of
*NL*
Vinteuil
's
sonata
for
the
piano
and
violin
-RRB-
,
he
held
it
safe
,
could
*NL*
have
it
again
to
himself
,
at
home
,
as
often
as
he
would
,
could
study
its
*NL*
language
and
acquire
its
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
when
the
pianist
had
finished
,
Swann
crossed
the
room
and
*NL*
thanked
him
with
a
vivacity
which
delighted
Mme.
Verdurin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
he
charming
?
''
she
asked
Swann
,
``
does
n't
he
just
understand
it
,
*NL*
his
sonata
,
the
little
wretch
?
You
never
dreamed
,
did
you
,
that
a
piano
*NL*
could
be
made
to
express
all
that
?
Upon
my
word
,
there
's
everything
in
*NL*
it
except
the
piano
!
I
'm
caught
out
every
time
I
hear
it
;
I
think
*NL*
I
'm
listening
to
an
orchestra
.
Though
it
's
better
,
really
,
than
an
*NL*
orchestra
,
more
complete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
pianist
bent
over
her
as
he
answered
,
smiling
and
underlining
*NL*
each
of
his
words
as
though
he
were
making
an
epigram
:
``
You
are
most
*NL*
generous
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
Mme.
Verdurin
was
saying
to
her
husband
,
``
Run
and
fetch
him
a
*NL*
glass
of
orangeade
;
it
's
well
earned
!
''
Swann
began
to
tell
Odette
how
he
*NL*
had
fallen
in
love
with
that
little
phrase
.
When
their
hostess
,
who
was
*NL*
a
little
way
off
,
called
out
,
``
Well
!
It
looks
to
me
as
though
some
one
*NL*
was
saying
nice
things
to
you
,
Odette
!
''
she
replied
,
``
Yes
,
very
*NL*
nice
,
''
and
he
found
her
simplicity
delightful
.
Then
he
asked
for
some
*NL*
information
about
this
Vinteuil
;
what
else
he
had
done
,
and
at
what
*NL*
period
in
his
life
he
had
composed
the
sonata
;
--
what
meaning
the
little
*NL*
phrase
could
have
had
for
him
,
that
was
what
Swann
wanted
most
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
none
of
these
people
who
professed
to
admire
this
musician
-LRB-
when
*NL*
Swann
had
said
that
the
sonata
was
really
charming
Mme.
Verdurin
had
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
I
quite
believe
it
!
Charming
,
indeed
!
But
you
do
n't
dare
to
*NL*
confess
that
you
do
n't
know
Vinteuil
's
sonata
;
you
have
no
right
not
to
*NL*
know
it
!
''
--
and
the
painter
had
gone
on
with
,
``
Ah
,
yes
,
it
's
a
very
fine
*NL*
bit
of
work
,
is
n't
it
?
Not
,
of
course
,
if
you
want
something
`
obvious
,
'
*NL*
something
`
popular
,
'
but
,
I
mean
to
say
,
it
makes
a
very
great
*NL*
impression
on
us
artists
.
''
-RRB-
,
none
of
them
seemed
ever
to
have
asked
*NL*
himself
these
questions
,
for
none
of
them
was
able
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
to
one
or
two
particular
remarks
made
by
Swann
on
his
favourite
*NL*
phrase
,
``
D'you
know
,
that
's
a
funny
thing
;
I
had
never
noticed
it
;
I
may
*NL*
as
well
tell
you
that
I
do
n't
much
care
about
peering
at
things
through
*NL*
a
microscope
,
and
pricking
myself
on
pin-points
of
difference
;
no
;
we
*NL*
do
n't
waste
time
splitting
hairs
in
this
house
;
why
not
?
well
,
it
's
not
*NL*
a
habit
of
ours
,
that
's
all
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
replied
,
while
Dr.
Cottard
*NL*
gazed
at
her
with
open-mouthed
admiration
,
and
yearned
to
be
able
to
*NL*
follow
her
as
she
skipped
lightly
from
one
stepping-stone
to
another
*NL*
of
her
stock
of
ready-made
phrases
.
Both
he
,
however
,
and
Mme.
Cottard
,
*NL*
with
a
kind
of
common
sense
which
is
shared
by
many
people
of
humble
*NL*
origin
,
would
always
take
care
not
to
express
an
opinion
,
or
to
pretend
*NL*
to
admire
a
piece
of
music
which
they
would
confess
to
each
other
,
once
*NL*
they
were
safely
at
home
,
that
they
no
more
understood
than
they
could
*NL*
understand
the
art
of
`
Master
'
Biche
.
Inasmuch
as
the
public
can
not
*NL*
recognise
the
charm
,
the
beauty
,
even
the
outlines
of
nature
save
in
the
*NL*
stereotyped
impressions
of
an
art
which
they
have
gradually
assimilated
,
*NL*
while
an
original
artist
starts
by
rejecting
those
impressions
,
so
*NL*
M.
and
Mme.
Cottard
,
typical
,
in
this
respect
,
of
the
public
,
were
*NL*
incapable
of
finding
,
either
in
Vinteuil
's
sonata
or
in
Biche
's
*NL*
portraits
,
what
constituted
harmony
,
for
them
,
in
music
or
beauty
in
*NL*
painting
.
It
appeared
to
them
,
when
the
pianist
played
his
sonata
,
as
*NL*
though
he
were
striking
haphazard
from
the
piano
a
medley
of
notes
which
*NL*
bore
no
relation
to
the
musical
forms
to
which
they
themselves
were
*NL*
accustomed
,
and
that
the
painter
simply
flung
the
colours
haphazard
upon
*NL*
his
canvas
.
When
,
on
one
of
these
,
they
were
able
to
distinguish
a
human
*NL*
form
,
they
always
found
it
coarsened
and
vulgarised
-LRB-
that
is
to
say
*NL*
lacking
all
the
elegance
of
the
school
of
painting
through
whose
*NL*
spectacles
they
themselves
were
in
the
habit
of
seeing
the
people
--
real
,
*NL*
living
people
,
who
passed
them
in
the
streets
-RRB-
and
devoid
of
truth
,
as
*NL*
though
M.
Biche
had
not
known
how
the
human
shoulder
was
constructed
,
or
*NL*
that
a
woman
's
hair
was
not
,
ordinarily
,
purple
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
when
the
`
faithful
'
were
scattered
out
of
earshot
,
the
Doctor
*NL*
felt
that
the
opportunity
was
too
good
to
be
missed
,
and
so
-LRB-
while
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
was
adding
a
final
word
of
commendation
of
Vinteuil
's
sonata
-RRB-
*NL*
like
a
would-be
swimmer
who
jumps
into
the
water
,
so
as
to
learn
,
but
*NL*
chooses
a
moment
when
there
are
not
too
many
people
looking
on
:
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
;
he
's
what
they
call
a
musician
_
di
primo
cartello
_
!
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
with
a
sudden
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
discovered
no
more
than
that
the
recent
publication
of
Vinteuil
's
*NL*
sonata
had
caused
a
great
stir
among
the
most
advanced
school
of
*NL*
musicians
,
but
that
it
was
still
unknown
to
the
general
public
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
some
one
,
quite
well
,
called
Vinteuil
,
''
said
Swann
,
thinking
of
*NL*
the
old
music-master
at
Combray
who
had
taught
my
grandmother
's
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
that
's
the
man
!
''
cried
Mme.
Verdurin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
Swann
burst
out
laughing
.
``
If
you
had
ever
seen
him
for
a
*NL*
moment
you
would
n't
put
the
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
to
put
the
question
is
to
solve
the
problem
?
''
the
Doctor
*NL*
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
may
well
be
some
relative
,
''
Swann
went
on
.
``
That
would
be
bad
*NL*
enough
;
but
,
after
all
,
there
is
no
reason
why
a
genius
should
n't
have
*NL*
a
cousin
who
is
a
silly
old
fool
.
And
if
that
should
be
so
,
I
swear
*NL*
there
's
no
known
or
unknown
form
of
torture
I
would
n't
undergo
to
*NL*
get
the
old
fool
to
introduce
me
to
the
man
who
composed
the
sonata
;
*NL*
starting
with
the
torture
of
the
old
fool
's
company
,
which
would
be
*NL*
ghastly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
understood
that
Vinteuil
was
seriously
ill
at
the
moment
,
*NL*
and
that
Dr.
Potain
despaired
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
Mme.
Verdurin
,
``
Do
people
still
call
in
Potain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Mme.
Verdurin
,
''
Cottard
simpered
,
``
you
forget
that
you
are
speaking
*NL*
of
one
of
my
colleagues
--
I
should
say
,
one
of
my
masters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
had
heard
,
somewhere
,
that
Vinteuil
was
threatened
with
the
*NL*
loss
of
his
reason
.
And
he
insisted
that
signs
of
this
could
be
detected
*NL*
in
certain
passages
in
the
sonata
.
This
remark
did
not
strike
Swann
as
*NL*
ridiculous
;
rather
,
it
puzzled
him
.
For
,
since
a
purely
musical
work
*NL*
contains
none
of
those
logical
sequences
,
the
interruption
or
confusion
*NL*
of
which
,
in
spoken
or
written
language
,
is
a
proof
of
insanity
,
so
*NL*
insanity
diagnosed
in
a
sonata
seemed
to
him
as
mysterious
a
thing
as
*NL*
the
insanity
of
a
dog
or
a
horse
,
although
instances
may
be
observed
of
*NL*
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
to
me
about
`
your
masters
'
;
you
know
ten
times
as
much
as
*NL*
he
does
!
''
Mme.
Verdurin
answered
Dr.
Cottard
,
in
the
tone
of
a
woman
who
*NL*
has
the
courage
of
her
convictions
,
and
is
quite
ready
to
stand
up
to
*NL*
anyone
who
disagrees
with
her
.
``
Anyhow
,
you
do
n't
kill
your
patients
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Madame
,
he
is
in
the
Academy
.
''
The
Doctor
smiled
with
bitter
*NL*
irony
.
``
If
a
sick
person
prefers
to
die
at
the
hands
of
one
of
the
*NL*
Princes
of
Science
...
It
is
far
more
smart
to
be
able
to
say
,
`
Yes
,
I
*NL*
have
Potain
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
More
smart
,
is
it
?
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
.
``
So
there
are
*NL*
fashions
,
nowadays
,
in
illness
,
are
there
?
I
did
n't
know
that
...
Oh
,
*NL*
you
do
make
me
laugh
!
''
she
screamed
,
suddenly
,
burying
her
face
in
her
*NL*
hands
.
``
And
here
was
I
,
poor
thing
,
talking
quite
seriously
,
and
never
*NL*
seeing
that
you
were
pulling
my
leg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
M.
Verdurin
,
finding
it
rather
a
strain
to
start
laughing
again
*NL*
over
so
small
a
matter
,
he
was
content
with
puffing
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
*NL*
from
his
pipe
,
while
he
reflected
sadly
that
he
could
never
again
hope
*NL*
to
keep
pace
with
his
wife
in
her
Atalanta-flights
across
the
field
of
*NL*
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'you
know
;
we
like
your
friend
so
very
much
,
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
,
*NL*
later
,
when
Odette
was
bidding
her
good
night
.
``
He
is
so
unaffected
,
*NL*
quite
charming
.
If
they
're
all
like
that
,
the
friends
you
want
to
bring
*NL*
here
,
by
all
means
bring
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Verdurin
remarked
that
Swann
had
failed
,
all
the
same
,
to
appreciate
*NL*
the
pianist
's
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
he
felt
a
little
strange
,
poor
man
,
''
suggested
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
.
``
You
ca
n't
expect
him
to
catch
the
tone
of
the
house
the
first
*NL*
time
he
comes
;
like
Cottard
,
who
has
been
one
of
our
little
`
clan
'
now
*NL*
for
years
.
The
first
time
does
n't
count
;
it
's
just
for
looking
round
and
*NL*
finding
out
things
.
Odette
,
he
understands
all
right
,
he
's
to
join
us
*NL*
to-morrow
at
the
Ch√¢telet
.
Perhaps
you
might
call
for
him
and
bring
*NL*
him
.
''
``
No
,
he
does
n't
want
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
;
just
as
you
like
.
Provided
he
does
n't
fail
us
at
the
*NL*
last
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Greatly
to
Mme.
Verdurin
's
surprise
,
he
never
failed
them
.
He
would
go
*NL*
to
meet
them
,
no
matter
where
,
at
restaurants
outside
Paris
-LRB-
not
that
*NL*
they
went
there
much
at
first
,
for
the
season
had
not
yet
begun
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
more
frequently
at
the
play
,
in
which
Mme.
Verdurin
delighted
.
One
*NL*
evening
,
when
they
were
dining
at
home
,
he
heard
her
complain
that
she
*NL*
had
not
one
of
those
permits
which
would
save
her
the
trouble
of
waiting
*NL*
at
doors
and
standing
in
crowds
,
and
say
how
useful
it
would
be
to
them
*NL*
at
first-nights
,
and
gala
performances
at
the
Opera
,
and
what
a
nuisance
*NL*
it
had
been
,
not
having
one
,
on
the
day
of
Gambetta
's
funeral
.
Swann
*NL*
never
spoke
of
his
distinguished
friends
,
but
only
of
such
as
might
be
*NL*
regarded
as
detrimental
,
whom
,
therefore
,
he
thought
it
snobbish
,
and
*NL*
in
not
very
good
taste
to
conceal
;
while
he
frequented
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Germain
he
had
come
to
include
,
in
the
latter
class
,
all
his
*NL*
friends
in
the
official
world
of
the
Third
Republic
,
and
so
broke
in
,
*NL*
without
thinking
:
``
I
'll
see
to
that
,
all
right
.
You
shall
have
it
in
*NL*
time
for
the
_
Danicheff
_
revival
.
I
shall
be
lunching
with
the
Prefect
*NL*
of
Police
to-morrow
,
as
it
happens
,
at
the
Elys√©e
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
The
Elys√©e
?
''
Dr.
Cottard
roared
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
at
M.
Gr√©vy
's
,
''
replied
Swann
,
feeling
a
little
awkward
at
the
*NL*
effect
which
his
announcement
had
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
often
taken
like
that
?
''
the
painter
asked
Cottard
,
with
*NL*
mock-seriousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
rule
,
once
an
explanation
had
been
given
,
Cottard
would
say
:
``
Ah
,
*NL*
good
,
good
;
that
's
all
right
,
then
,
''
after
which
he
would
shew
not
the
*NL*
least
trace
of
emotion
.
But
this
time
Swann
's
last
words
,
instead
of
the
*NL*
usual
calming
effect
,
had
that
of
heating
,
instantly
,
to
boiling-point
*NL*
his
astonishment
at
the
discovery
that
a
man
with
whom
he
himself
*NL*
was
actually
sitting
at
table
,
a
man
who
had
no
official
position
,
no
*NL*
honours
or
distinction
of
any
sort
,
was
on
visiting
terms
with
the
Head
*NL*
of
the
State
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
you
say
?
M.
Gr√©vy
?
Do
you
know
M.
Gr√©vy
?
''
he
demanded
of
*NL*
Swann
,
in
the
stupid
and
incredulous
tone
of
a
constable
on
duty
at
the
*NL*
palace
,
when
a
stranger
has
come
up
and
asked
to
see
the
President
of
*NL*
the
Republic
;
until
,
guessing
from
his
words
and
manner
what
,
as
the
*NL*
newspapers
say
,
`
it
is
a
case
of
,
'
he
assures
the
poor
lunatic
that
he
*NL*
will
be
admitted
at
once
,
and
points
the
way
to
the
reception
ward
of
*NL*
the
police
infirmary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
him
slightly
;
we
have
some
friends
in
common
''
-LRB-
Swann
dared
not
*NL*
add
that
one
of
these
friends
was
the
Prince
of
Wales
-RRB-
.
``
Anyhow
,
he
is
*NL*
very
free
with
his
invitations
,
and
,
I
assure
you
,
his
luncheon-parties
*NL*
are
not
the
least
bit
amusing
;
they
're
very
simple
affairs
,
too
,
you
*NL*
know
;
never
more
than
eight
at
table
,
''
he
went
on
,
trying
desperately
*NL*
to
cut
out
everything
that
seemed
to
shew
off
his
relations
with
the
*NL*
President
in
a
light
too
dazzling
for
the
Doctor
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
Cottard
,
at
once
conforming
in
his
mind
to
the
literal
*NL*
interpretation
of
what
Swann
was
saying
,
decided
that
invitations
from
*NL*
M.
Gr√©vy
were
very
little
sought
after
,
were
sent
out
,
in
fact
,
into
*NL*
the
highways
and
hedge-rows
.
And
from
that
moment
he
never
seemed
at
*NL*
all
surprised
to
hear
that
Swann
,
or
anyone
else
,
was
`
always
at
*NL*
the
Elys√©e
'
;
he
even
felt
a
little
sorry
for
a
man
who
had
to
go
to
*NL*
luncheon-parties
which
,
he
himself
admitted
,
were
a
bore
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good
,
good
;
that
's
quite
all
right
then
,
''
he
said
,
in
the
tone
of
*NL*
a
customs
official
who
has
been
suspicious
up
to
now
,
but
,
after
hearing
*NL*
your
explanations
,
stamps
your
passport
and
lets
you
proceed
on
your
*NL*
journey
without
troubling
to
examine
your
luggage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
well
believe
you
do
n't
find
them
amusing
,
those
parties
;
indeed
,
*NL*
it
's
very
good
of
you
to
go
to
them
!
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
regarded
*NL*
the
President
of
the
Republic
only
as
a
`
bore
'
to
be
especially
dreaded
,
*NL*
since
he
had
at
his
disposal
means
of
seduction
,
and
even
of
compulsion
,
*NL*
which
,
if
employed
to
captivate
her
`
faithful
,
'
might
easily
make
them
*NL*
`
fail
.
'
``
It
seems
,
he
's
as
deaf
as
a
post
;
and
eats
with
his
fingers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
!
Then
it
ca
n't
be
much
fun
for
you
,
going
there
.
''
A
*NL*
note
of
pity
sounded
in
the
Doctor
's
voice
;
and
then
struck
by
the
*NL*
number
--
only
eight
at
table
--
``
Are
these
luncheons
what
you
would
*NL*
describe
as
`
intimate
'
?
''
he
inquired
briskly
,
not
so
much
out
of
idle
*NL*
curiosity
as
in
his
linguistic
zeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
so
great
and
glorious
a
figure
was
the
President
of
the
French
*NL*
Republic
in
the
eyes
of
Dr.
Cottard
that
neither
the
modesty
of
Swann
*NL*
nor
the
spite
of
Mme.
Verdurin
could
ever
wholly
efface
that
first
*NL*
impression
,
and
he
never
sat
down
to
dinner
with
the
Verdurins
without
*NL*
asking
anxiously
,
``
D'you
think
we
shall
see
M.
Swann
here
this
evening
?
*NL*
He
is
a
personal
friend
of
M.
Gr√©vy
's
.
I
suppose
that
means
he
's
what
*NL*
you
'd
call
a
`
gentleman
'
?
''
He
even
went
to
the
length
of
offering
Swann
*NL*
a
card
of
invitation
to
the
Dental
Exhibition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
let
you
in
,
and
anyone
you
take
with
you
,
''
he
explained
,
``
but
*NL*
dogs
are
not
admitted
.
I
'm
just
warning
you
,
you
understand
,
because
*NL*
some
friends
of
mine
went
there
once
,
who
had
n't
been
told
,
and
there
*NL*
was
the
devil
to
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
M.
Verdurin
,
he
did
not
fail
to
observe
the
distressing
effect
*NL*
upon
his
wife
of
the
discovery
that
Swann
had
influential
friends
of
*NL*
whom
he
had
never
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
no
arrangement
had
been
made
to
`
go
anywhere
,
'
it
was
at
the
*NL*
Verdurins
'
that
Swann
would
find
the
`
little
nucleus
'
assembled
,
but
*NL*
he
never
appeared
there
except
in
the
evenings
,
and
would
hardly
ever
*NL*
accept
their
invitations
to
dinner
,
in
spite
of
Odette
's
entreaties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
dine
with
you
alone
somewhere
,
if
you
'd
rather
,
''
she
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
about
Mme.
Verdurin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
quite
simple
.
I
need
only
say
that
my
dress
was
n't
ready
,
or
*NL*
that
my
cab
came
late
.
There
is
always
some
excuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
charming
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Swann
said
to
himself
that
,
if
he
could
make
Odette
feel
-LRB-
by
*NL*
consenting
to
meet
her
only
after
dinner
-RRB-
that
there
were
other
*NL*
pleasures
which
he
preferred
to
that
of
her
company
,
then
the
desire
*NL*
that
she
felt
for
his
would
be
all
the
longer
in
reaching
the
point
of
*NL*
satiety
.
Besides
,
as
he
infinitely
preferred
to
Odette
's
style
of
beauty
*NL*
that
of
a
little
working
girl
,
as
fresh
and
plump
as
a
rose
,
with
whom
*NL*
he
happened
to
be
simultaneously
in
love
,
he
preferred
to
spend
the
*NL*
first
part
of
the
evening
with
her
,
knowing
that
he
was
sure
to
see
*NL*
Odette
later
on
.
For
the
same
reason
,
he
would
never
allow
Odette
to
*NL*
call
for
him
at
his
house
,
to
take
him
on
to
the
Verdurins
'
.
The
little
*NL*
girl
used
to
wait
,
not
far
from
his
door
,
at
a
street
corner
;
R√©mi
,
his
*NL*
coachman
,
knew
where
to
stop
;
she
would
jump
in
beside
him
,
and
hold
him
*NL*
in
her
arms
until
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
Verdurins
'
.
He
would
enter
*NL*
the
drawing-room
;
and
there
,
while
Mme.
Verdurin
,
pointing
to
the
roses
*NL*
which
he
had
sent
her
that
morning
,
said
:
``
I
am
furious
with
you
!
''
and
*NL*
sent
him
to
the
place
kept
for
him
,
by
the
side
of
Odette
,
the
pianist
*NL*
would
play
to
them
--
for
their
two
selves
,
and
for
no
one
else
--
that
*NL*
little
phrase
by
Vinteuil
which
was
,
so
to
speak
,
the
national
anthem
of
*NL*
their
love
.
He
began
,
always
,
with
a
sustained
tremolo
from
the
violin
*NL*
part
,
which
,
for
several
bars
,
was
unaccompanied
,
and
filled
all
the
*NL*
foreground
;
until
suddenly
it
seemed
to
be
drawn
aside
,
and
--
just
as
in
*NL*
those
interiors
by
Pieter
de
Hooch
,
where
the
subject
is
set
back
a
*NL*
long
way
through
the
narrow
framework
of
a
half-opened
door
--
infinitely
*NL*
remote
,
in
colour
quite
different
,
velvety
with
the
radiance
of
some
*NL*
intervening
light
,
the
little
phrase
appeared
,
dancing
,
pastoral
,
*NL*
interpolated
,
episodic
,
belonging
to
another
world
.
It
passed
,
with
*NL*
simple
and
immortal
movements
,
scattering
on
every
side
the
bounties
of
*NL*
its
grace
,
smiling
ineffably
still
;
but
Swann
thought
that
he
could
now
*NL*
discern
in
it
some
disenchantment
.
It
seemed
to
be
aware
how
vain
,
how
*NL*
hollow
was
the
happiness
to
which
it
shewed
the
way
.
In
its
airy
grace
*NL*
there
was
,
indeed
,
something
definitely
achieved
,
and
complete
in
*NL*
itself
,
like
the
mood
of
philosophic
detachment
which
follows
an
*NL*
outburst
of
vain
regret
.
But
little
did
that
matter
to
him
;
he
looked
*NL*
upon
the
sonata
less
in
its
own
light
--
as
what
it
might
express
,
had
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
expressed
to
a
certain
musician
,
ignorant
that
any
Swann
or
*NL*
Odette
,
anywhere
in
the
world
,
existed
,
when
he
composed
it
,
and
*NL*
would
express
to
all
those
who
should
hear
it
played
in
centuries
*NL*
to
come
--
than
as
a
pledge
,
a
token
of
his
love
,
which
made
even
the
*NL*
Verdurins
and
their
little
pianist
think
of
Odette
and
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
of
himself
--
which
bound
her
to
him
by
a
lasting
tie
;
and
at
that
*NL*
point
he
had
-LRB-
whimsically
entreated
by
Odette
-RRB-
abandoned
the
idea
of
*NL*
getting
some
`
professional
'
to
play
over
to
him
the
whole
sonata
,
of
*NL*
which
he
still
knew
no
more
than
this
one
passage
.
``
Why
do
you
want
the
*NL*
rest
?
''
she
had
asked
him
.
``
Our
little
bit
;
that
's
all
we
need
.
''
He
went
*NL*
farther
;
agonised
by
the
reflection
,
at
the
moment
when
it
passed
by
*NL*
him
,
so
near
and
yet
so
infinitely
remote
,
that
,
while
it
was
addressed
*NL*
to
their
ears
,
it
knew
them
not
,
he
would
regret
,
almost
,
that
it
had
*NL*
a
meaning
of
its
own
,
an
intrinsic
and
unalterable
beauty
,
foreign
to
*NL*
themselves
,
just
as
in
the
jewels
given
to
us
,
or
even
in
the
letters
*NL*
written
to
us
by
a
woman
with
whom
we
are
in
love
,
we
find
fault
with
*NL*
the
`
water
'
of
a
stone
,
or
with
the
words
of
a
sentence
because
they
are
*NL*
not
fashioned
exclusively
from
the
spirit
of
a
fleeting
intimacy
and
of
*NL*
a
`
lass
unparalleled
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
happen
,
as
often
as
not
,
that
he
had
stayed
so
long
outside
,
*NL*
with
his
little
girl
,
before
going
to
the
Verdurins
'
that
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
little
phrase
had
been
rendered
by
the
pianist
,
Swann
would
discover
*NL*
that
it
was
almost
time
for
Odette
to
go
home
.
He
used
to
take
her
back
*NL*
as
far
as
the
door
of
her
little
house
in
the
Rue
La
P√©rouse
,
behind
the
*NL*
Arc
de
Triomphe
.
And
it
was
perhaps
on
this
account
,
and
so
as
not
to
*NL*
demand
the
monopoly
of
her
favours
,
that
he
sacrificed
the
pleasure
-LRB-
not
*NL*
so
essential
to
his
well-being
-RRB-
of
seeing
her
earlier
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
of
arriving
with
her
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
to
the
exercise
of
this
other
*NL*
privilege
,
for
which
she
was
grateful
,
of
their
leaving
together
;
a
*NL*
privilege
which
he
valued
all
the
more
because
,
thanks
to
it
,
he
had
*NL*
the
feeling
that
no
one
else
would
see
her
,
no
one
would
thrust
himself
*NL*
between
them
,
no
one
could
prevent
him
from
remaining
with
her
in
*NL*
spirit
,
after
he
had
left
her
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
night
after
night
,
she
would
be
taken
home
in
Swann
's
carriage
;
*NL*
and
one
night
,
after
she
had
got
down
,
and
while
he
stood
at
the
gate
*NL*
and
murmured
``
Till
to-morrow
,
then
!
''
she
turned
impulsively
from
him
,
*NL*
plucked
a
last
lingering
chrysanthemum
in
the
tiny
garden
which
flanked
*NL*
the
pathway
from
the
street
to
her
house
,
and
as
he
went
back
to
his
*NL*
carriage
thrust
it
into
his
hand
.
He
held
it
pressed
to
his
lips
during
*NL*
the
drive
home
,
and
when
,
in
due
course
,
the
flower
withered
,
locked
it
*NL*
away
,
like
something
very
precious
,
in
a
secret
drawer
of
his
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
escort
her
to
her
gate
,
but
no
farther
.
Twice
only
had
he
gone
*NL*
inside
to
take
part
in
the
ceremony
--
of
such
vital
importance
in
her
*NL*
life
--
of
`
afternoon
tea
.
'
The
loneliness
and
emptiness
of
those
*NL*
short
streets
-LRB-
consisting
,
almost
entirely
,
of
low-roofed
houses
,
*NL*
self-contained
but
not
detached
,
their
monotony
interrupted
here
and
*NL*
there
by
the
dark
intrusion
of
some
sinister
little
shop
,
at
once
*NL*
an
historical
document
and
a
sordid
survival
from
the
days
when
the
*NL*
district
was
still
one
of
ill
repute
-RRB-
,
the
snow
which
had
lain
on
the
*NL*
garden-beds
or
clung
to
the
branches
of
the
trees
,
the
careless
disarray
*NL*
of
the
season
,
the
assertion
,
in
this
man-made
city
,
of
a
state
of
*NL*
nature
,
had
all
combined
to
add
an
element
of
mystery
to
the
warmth
,
the
*NL*
flowers
,
the
luxury
which
he
had
found
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
by
-LRB-
on
his
left-hand
side
,
and
on
what
,
although
raised
some
way
*NL*
above
the
street
,
was
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
-RRB-
Odette
's
bedroom
,
*NL*
which
looked
out
to
the
back
over
another
little
street
running
parallel
*NL*
with
her
own
,
he
had
climbed
a
staircase
that
went
straight
up
between
*NL*
dark
painted
walls
,
from
which
hung
Oriental
draperies
,
strings
of
*NL*
Turkish
beads
,
and
a
huge
Japanese
lantern
,
suspended
by
a
silken
cord
*NL*
from
the
ceiling
-LRB-
which
last
,
however
,
so
that
her
visitors
should
not
*NL*
have
to
complain
of
the
want
of
any
of
the
latest
comforts
of
*NL*
Western
civilisation
,
was
lighted
by
a
gas-jet
inside
-RRB-
,
to
the
two
*NL*
drawing-rooms
,
large
and
small
.
These
were
entered
through
a
narrow
*NL*
lobby
,
the
wall
of
which
,
chequered
with
the
lozenges
of
a
wooden
*NL*
trellis
such
as
you
see
on
garden
walls
,
only
gilded
,
was
lined
from
*NL*
end
to
end
by
a
long
rectangular
box
in
which
bloomed
,
as
though
in
a
*NL*
hothouse
,
a
row
of
large
chrysanthemums
,
at
that
time
still
*NL*
uncommon
,
though
by
no
means
so
large
as
the
mammoth
blossoms
which
*NL*
horticulturists
have
since
succeeded
in
making
grow
.
Swann
was
*NL*
irritated
,
as
a
rule
,
by
the
sight
of
these
flowers
,
which
had
then
been
*NL*
`
the
rage
'
in
Paris
for
about
a
year
,
but
it
had
pleased
him
,
on
this
*NL*
occasion
,
to
see
the
gloom
of
the
little
lobby
shot
with
rays
of
pink
*NL*
and
gold
and
white
by
the
fragrant
petals
of
these
ephemeral
stars
,
*NL*
which
kindle
their
cold
fires
in
the
murky
atmosphere
of
winter
*NL*
afternoons
.
Odette
had
received
him
in
a
tea-gown
of
pink
silk
,
which
*NL*
left
her
neck
and
arms
bare
.
She
had
made
him
sit
down
beside
her
in
one
*NL*
of
the
many
mysterious
little
retreats
which
had
been
contrived
in
the
*NL*
various
recesses
of
the
room
,
sheltered
by
enormous
palmtrees
growing
*NL*
out
of
pots
of
Chinese
porcelain
,
or
by
screens
upon
which
were
fastened
*NL*
photographs
and
fans
and
bows
of
ribbon
.
She
had
said
at
once
,
``
You
're
*NL*
not
comfortable
there
;
wait
a
minute
,
I
'll
arrange
things
for
you
,
''
and
*NL*
with
a
titter
of
laughter
,
the
complacency
of
which
implied
that
*NL*
some
little
invention
of
her
own
was
being
brought
into
play
,
she
*NL*
had
installed
behind
his
head
and
beneath
his
feet
great
cushions
of
*NL*
Japanese
silk
,
which
she
pummelled
and
buffeted
as
though
determined
to
*NL*
lavish
on
him
all
her
riches
,
and
regardless
of
their
value
.
But
when
*NL*
her
footman
began
to
come
into
the
room
,
bringing
,
one
after
another
,
*NL*
the
innumerable
lamps
which
-LRB-
contained
,
mostly
,
in
porcelain
vases
-RRB-
*NL*
burned
singly
or
in
pairs
upon
the
different
pieces
of
furniture
as
upon
*NL*
so
many
altars
,
rekindling
in
the
twilight
,
already
almost
nocturnal
,
of
*NL*
this
winter
afternoon
,
the
glow
of
a
sunset
more
lasting
,
more
roseate
,
*NL*
more
human
--
filling
,
perhaps
,
with
romantic
wonder
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
some
solitary
lover
,
wandering
in
the
street
below
and
brought
to
a
*NL*
standstill
before
the
mystery
of
the
human
presence
which
those
lighted
*NL*
windows
at
once
revealed
and
screened
from
sight
--
she
had
kept
an
eye
*NL*
sharply
fixed
on
the
servant
,
to
see
whether
he
set
each
of
the
lamps
*NL*
down
in
the
place
appointed
it
.
She
felt
that
,
if
he
were
to
put
*NL*
even
one
of
them
where
it
ought
not
to
be
,
the
general
effect
of
her
*NL*
drawing-room
would
be
destroyed
,
and
that
her
portrait
,
which
rested
*NL*
upon
a
sloping
easel
draped
with
plush
,
would
not
catch
the
light
.
And
*NL*
so
,
with
feverish
impatience
,
she
followed
the
man
's
clumsy
movements
,
*NL*
scolding
him
severely
when
he
passed
too
close
to
a
pair
of
beaupots
,
*NL*
which
she
made
a
point
of
always
tidying
herself
,
in
case
the
plants
*NL*
should
be
knocked
over
--
and
went
across
to
them
now
to
make
sure
that
he
*NL*
had
not
broken
off
any
of
the
flowers
.
She
found
something
`
quaint
'
in
*NL*
the
shape
of
each
of
her
Chinese
ornaments
,
and
also
in
her
orchids
,
the
*NL*
cattleyas
especially
-LRB-
these
being
,
with
chrysanthemums
,
her
favourite
*NL*
flowers
-RRB-
,
because
they
had
the
supreme
merit
of
not
looking
in
the
least
*NL*
like
other
flowers
,
but
of
being
made
,
apparently
,
out
of
scraps
of
silk
*NL*
or
satin
.
``
It
looks
just
as
though
it
had
been
cut
out
of
the
lining
*NL*
of
my
cloak
,
''
she
said
to
Swann
,
pointing
to
an
orchid
,
with
a
shade
of
*NL*
respect
in
her
voice
for
so
`
smart
'
a
flower
,
for
this
distinguished
,
*NL*
unexpected
sister
whom
nature
had
suddenly
bestowed
upon
her
,
so
far
*NL*
removed
from
her
in
the
scale
of
existence
,
and
yet
so
delicate
,
so
*NL*
refined
,
so
much
more
worthy
than
many
real
women
of
admission
to
*NL*
her
drawing-room
.
As
she
drew
his
attention
,
now
to
the
fiery-tongued
*NL*
dragons
painted
upon
a
bowl
or
stitched
upon
a
fire-screen
,
now
to
a
*NL*
fleshy
cluster
of
orchids
,
now
to
a
dromedary
of
inlaid
silver-work
with
*NL*
ruby
eyes
,
which
kept
company
,
upon
her
mantelpiece
,
with
a
toad
carved
*NL*
in
jade
,
she
would
pretend
now
to
be
shrinking
from
the
ferocity
of
the
*NL*
monsters
or
laughing
at
their
absurdity
,
now
blushing
at
the
indecency
*NL*
of
the
flowers
,
now
carried
away
by
an
irresistible
desire
to
run
across
*NL*
and
kiss
the
toad
and
dromedary
,
calling
them
`
darlings
.
'
And
these
*NL*
affectations
were
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
sincerity
of
some
of
her
*NL*
attitudes
,
notably
her
devotion
to
Our
Lady
of
the
Laghetto
who
had
*NL*
once
,
when
Odette
was
living
at
Nice
,
cured
her
of
a
mortal
illness
,
and
*NL*
whose
medal
,
in
gold
,
she
always
carried
on
her
person
,
attributing
*NL*
to
it
unlimited
powers
.
She
poured
out
Swann
's
tea
,
inquired
``
Lemon
*NL*
or
cream
?
''
and
,
on
his
answering
``
Cream
,
please
,
''
went
on
,
smiling
,
``
A
*NL*
cloud
!
''
And
as
he
pronounced
it
excellent
,
``
You
see
,
I
know
just
how
you
*NL*
like
it
.
''
This
tea
had
indeed
seemed
to
Swann
,
just
as
it
seemed
to
*NL*
her
,
something
precious
,
and
love
is
so
far
obliged
to
find
some
*NL*
justification
for
itself
,
some
guarantee
of
its
duration
in
pleasures
*NL*
which
,
on
the
contrary
,
would
have
no
existence
apart
from
love
and
must
*NL*
cease
with
its
passing
,
that
when
he
left
her
,
at
seven
o'clock
,
to
go
*NL*
and
dress
for
the
evening
,
all
the
way
home
,
sitting
bolt
upright
in
*NL*
his
brougham
,
unable
to
repress
the
happiness
with
which
the
afternoon
's
*NL*
adventure
had
filled
him
,
he
kept
on
repeating
to
himself
:
``
What
fun
*NL*
it
would
be
to
have
a
little
woman
like
that
in
a
place
where
one
could
*NL*
always
be
certain
of
finding
,
what
one
never
can
be
certain
of
finding
,
*NL*
a
really
good
cup
of
tea
.
''
An
hour
or
so
later
he
received
a
note
from
*NL*
Odette
,
and
at
once
recognised
that
florid
handwriting
,
in
which
an
*NL*
affectation
of
British
stiffness
imposed
an
apparent
discipline
upon
its
*NL*
shapeless
characters
,
significant
,
perhaps
,
to
less
intimate
eyes
*NL*
than
his
,
of
an
untidiness
of
mind
,
a
fragmentary
education
,
a
want
of
*NL*
sincerity
and
decision
.
Swann
had
left
his
cigarette-case
at
her
house
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
she
wrote
,
``
did
you
not
forget
your
heart
also
?
I
should
never
*NL*
have
let
you
have
that
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
More
important
,
perhaps
,
was
a
second
visit
which
he
paid
her
,
a
little
*NL*
later
.
On
his
way
to
the
house
,
as
always
when
he
knew
that
they
were
to
*NL*
meet
,
he
formed
a
picture
of
her
in
his
mind
;
and
the
necessity
,
if
he
*NL*
was
to
find
any
beauty
in
her
face
,
of
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
fresh
and
*NL*
rosy
protuberance
of
her
cheekbones
,
and
of
shutting
out
all
the
rest
of
*NL*
those
cheeks
which
were
so
often
languorous
and
sallow
,
except
when
*NL*
they
were
punctuated
with
little
fiery
spots
,
plunged
him
in
acute
*NL*
depression
,
as
proving
that
one
's
ideal
is
always
unattainable
,
and
*NL*
one
's
actual
happiness
mediocre
.
He
was
taking
her
an
engraving
which
*NL*
she
had
asked
to
see
.
She
was
not
very
well
;
she
received
him
,
wearing
*NL*
a
wrapper
of
mauve
_
cr√™pe
de
Chine
_
,
which
draped
her
bosom
,
like
a
*NL*
mantle
,
with
a
richly
embroidered
web
.
As
she
stood
there
beside
him
,
*NL*
brushing
his
cheek
with
the
loosened
tresses
of
her
hair
,
bending
one
*NL*
knee
in
what
was
almost
a
dancer
's
pose
,
so
that
she
could
lean
without
*NL*
tiring
herself
over
the
picture
,
at
which
she
was
gazing
,
with
bended
*NL*
head
,
out
of
those
great
eyes
,
which
seemed
so
weary
and
so
sullen
when
*NL*
there
was
nothing
to
animate
her
,
Swann
was
struck
by
her
resemblance
to
*NL*
the
figure
of
Zipporah
,
Jethro
's
Daughter
,
which
is
to
be
seen
in
one
*NL*
of
the
Sistine
frescoes
.
He
had
always
found
a
peculiar
fascination
*NL*
in
tracing
in
the
paintings
of
the
Old
Masters
,
not
merely
the
general
*NL*
characteristics
of
the
people
whom
he
encountered
in
his
daily
life
,
but
*NL*
rather
what
seems
least
susceptible
of
generalisation
,
the
individual
*NL*
features
of
men
and
women
whom
he
knew
,
as
,
for
instance
,
in
a
bust
*NL*
of
the
Doge
Loredan
by
Antonio
Rizzo
,
the
prominent
cheekbones
,
the
*NL*
slanting
eyebrows
,
in
short
,
a
speaking
likeness
to
his
own
coachman
*NL*
R√©mi
;
in
the
colouring
of
a
Ghirlandaio
,
the
nose
of
M.
de
Palancy
;
in
a
*NL*
portrait
by
Tintoretto
,
the
invasion
of
the
plumpness
of
the
cheek
by
an
*NL*
outcrop
of
whisker
,
the
broken
nose
,
the
penetrating
stare
,
the
swollen
*NL*
eyelids
of
Dr.
du
Boulbon
.
Perhaps
because
he
had
always
regretted
,
*NL*
in
his
heart
,
that
he
had
confined
his
attention
to
the
social
side
of
*NL*
life
,
had
talked
,
always
,
rather
than
acted
,
he
felt
that
he
might
find
*NL*
a
sort
of
indulgence
bestowed
upon
him
by
those
great
artists
,
in
his
*NL*
perception
of
the
fact
that
they
also
had
regarded
with
pleasure
and
had
*NL*
admitted
into
the
canon
of
their
works
such
types
of
physiognomy
as
give
*NL*
those
works
the
strongest
possible
certificate
of
reality
and
trueness
*NL*
to
life
;
a
modern
,
almost
a
topical
savour
;
perhaps
,
also
,
he
had
so
far
*NL*
succumbed
to
the
prevailing
frivolity
of
the
world
of
fashion
that
he
*NL*
felt
the
necessity
of
finding
in
an
old
masterpiece
some
such
obvious
*NL*
and
refreshing
allusion
to
a
person
about
whom
jokes
could
be
made
and
*NL*
repeated
and
enjoyed
to-day
.
Perhaps
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
had
*NL*
retained
enough
of
the
artistic
temperament
to
be
able
to
find
a
genuine
*NL*
satisfaction
in
watching
these
individual
features
take
on
a
more
*NL*
general
significance
when
he
saw
them
,
uprooted
and
disembodied
,
in
the
*NL*
abstract
idea
of
similarity
between
an
historic
portrait
and
a
modern
*NL*
original
,
whom
it
was
not
intended
to
represent
.
However
that
might
be
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
because
the
abundance
of
impressions
which
he
,
for
some
time
*NL*
past
,
had
been
receiving
--
though
,
indeed
,
they
had
come
to
him
rather
*NL*
through
the
channel
of
his
appreciation
of
music
--
had
enriched
his
*NL*
appetite
for
painting
as
well
,
it
was
with
an
unusual
intensity
*NL*
of
pleasure
,
a
pleasure
destined
to
have
a
lasting
effect
upon
his
*NL*
character
and
conduct
,
that
Swann
remarked
Odette
's
resemblance
to
the
*NL*
Zipporah
of
that
Alessandro
de
Mariano
,
to
whom
one
shrinks
from
giving
*NL*
his
more
popular
surname
,
now
that
`
Botticelli
'
suggests
not
so
much
the
*NL*
actual
work
of
the
Master
as
that
false
and
banal
conception
of
it
which
*NL*
has
of
late
obtained
common
currency
.
He
no
longer
based
his
estimate
*NL*
of
the
merit
of
Odette
's
face
on
the
more
or
less
good
quality
of
her
*NL*
cheeks
,
and
the
softness
and
sweetness
--
as
of
carnation-petals
--
which
,
*NL*
he
supposed
,
would
greet
his
lips
there
,
should
he
ever
hazard
an
*NL*
embrace
,
but
regarded
it
rather
as
a
skein
of
subtle
and
lovely
silken
*NL*
threads
,
which
his
gazing
eyes
collected
and
wound
together
,
following
*NL*
the
curving
line
from
the
skein
to
the
ball
,
where
he
mingled
the
*NL*
cadence
of
her
neck
with
the
spring
of
her
hair
and
the
droop
of
her
*NL*
eyelids
,
as
though
from
a
portrait
of
herself
,
in
which
her
type
was
*NL*
made
clearly
intelligible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
gazing
at
her
;
traces
of
the
old
fresco
were
apparent
in
*NL*
her
face
and
limbs
,
and
these
he
tried
incessantly
,
afterwards
,
to
*NL*
recapture
,
both
when
he
was
with
Odette
,
and
when
he
was
only
thinking
*NL*
of
her
in
her
absence
;
and
,
albeit
his
admiration
for
the
Florentine
*NL*
masterpiece
was
probably
based
upon
his
discovery
that
it
had
been
*NL*
reproduced
in
her
,
the
similarity
enhanced
her
beauty
also
,
and
rendered
*NL*
her
more
precious
in
his
sight
.
Swann
reproached
himself
with
his
*NL*
failure
,
hitherto
,
to
estimate
at
her
true
worth
a
creature
whom
the
*NL*
great
Sandro
would
have
adored
,
and
counted
himself
fortunate
that
his
*NL*
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
Odette
found
a
justification
in
his
own
*NL*
system
of
aesthetic
.
He
told
himself
that
,
in
choosing
the
thought
of
*NL*
Odette
as
the
inspiration
of
his
dreams
of
ideal
happiness
,
he
was
not
,
*NL*
as
he
had
until
then
supposed
,
falling
back
,
merely
,
upon
an
expedient
*NL*
of
doubtful
and
certainly
inadequate
value
,
since
she
contained
in
*NL*
herself
what
satisfied
the
utmost
refinement
of
his
taste
in
art
.
He
*NL*
failed
to
observe
that
this
quality
would
not
naturally
avail
to
bring
*NL*
Odette
into
the
category
of
women
whom
he
found
desirable
,
simply
*NL*
because
his
desires
had
always
run
counter
to
his
aesthetic
taste
.
The
*NL*
words
`
Florentine
painting
'
were
invaluable
to
Swann
.
They
enabled
him
*NL*
-LRB-
gave
him
,
as
it
were
,
a
legal
title
-RRB-
to
introduce
the
image
of
Odette
*NL*
into
a
world
of
dreams
and
fancies
which
,
until
then
,
she
had
been
*NL*
debarred
from
entering
,
and
where
she
assumed
a
new
and
nobler
form
.
And
*NL*
whereas
the
mere
sight
of
her
in
the
flesh
,
by
perpetually
reviving
his
*NL*
misgivings
as
to
the
quality
of
her
face
,
her
figure
,
the
whole
of
her
*NL*
beauty
,
used
to
cool
the
ardour
of
his
love
,
those
misgivings
were
swept
*NL*
away
and
that
love
confirmed
now
that
he
could
re-erect
his
estimate
of
*NL*
her
on
the
sure
foundations
of
his
aesthetic
principles
;
while
the
kiss
,
*NL*
the
bodily
surrender
which
would
have
seemed
natural
and
but
moderately
*NL*
attractive
,
had
they
been
granted
him
by
a
creature
of
somewhat
withered
*NL*
flesh
and
sluggish
blood
,
coming
,
as
now
they
came
,
to
crown
his
*NL*
adoration
of
a
masterpiece
in
a
gallery
,
must
,
it
seemed
,
prove
as
*NL*
exquisite
as
they
would
be
supernatural
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
he
was
tempted
to
regret
that
,
for
months
past
,
he
had
done
*NL*
nothing
but
visit
Odette
,
he
would
assure
himself
that
he
was
*NL*
not
unreasonable
in
giving
up
much
of
his
time
to
the
study
of
an
*NL*
inestimably
precious
work
of
art
,
cast
for
once
in
a
new
,
a
different
,
*NL*
an
especially
charming
metal
,
in
an
unmatched
exemplar
which
he
would
*NL*
contemplate
at
one
moment
with
the
humble
,
spiritual
,
disinterested
mind
*NL*
of
an
artist
,
at
another
with
the
pride
,
the
selfishness
,
the
sensual
*NL*
thrill
of
a
collector
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
study
table
,
at
which
he
worked
,
he
had
placed
,
as
it
were
a
*NL*
photograph
of
Odette
,
a
reproduction
of
Jethro
's
Daughter
.
He
would
*NL*
gaze
in
admiration
at
the
large
eyes
,
the
delicate
features
in
which
the
*NL*
imperfection
of
her
skin
might
be
surmised
,
the
marvellous
locks
of
hair
*NL*
that
fell
along
her
tired
cheeks
;
and
,
adapting
what
he
had
already
felt
*NL*
to
be
beautiful
,
on
aesthetic
grounds
,
to
the
idea
of
a
living
woman
,
*NL*
he
converted
it
into
a
series
of
physical
merits
which
he
congratulated
*NL*
himself
on
finding
assembled
in
the
person
of
one
whom
he
might
,
*NL*
ultimately
,
possess
.
The
vague
feeling
of
sympathy
which
attracts
a
*NL*
spectator
to
a
work
of
art
,
now
that
he
knew
the
type
,
in
warm
flesh
*NL*
and
blood
,
of
Jethro
's
Daughter
,
became
a
desire
which
more
than
*NL*
compensated
,
thenceforward
,
for
that
with
which
Odette
's
physical
charms
*NL*
had
at
first
failed
to
inspire
him
.
When
he
had
sat
for
a
long
time
*NL*
gazing
at
the
Botticelli
,
he
would
think
of
his
own
living
Botticelli
,
*NL*
who
seemed
all
the
lovelier
in
contrast
,
and
as
he
drew
towards
him
*NL*
the
photograph
of
Zipporah
he
would
imagine
that
he
was
holding
Odette
*NL*
against
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
only
Odette
's
indifference
,
however
,
that
he
must
take
pains
*NL*
to
circumvent
;
it
was
also
,
not
infrequently
,
his
own
;
feeling
that
,
*NL*
since
Odette
had
had
every
facility
for
seeing
him
,
she
seemed
no
longer
*NL*
to
have
very
much
to
say
to
him
when
they
did
meet
,
he
was
afraid
*NL*
lest
the
manner
--
at
once
trivial
,
monotonous
,
and
seemingly
*NL*
unalterable
--
which
she
now
adopted
when
they
were
together
should
*NL*
ultimately
destroy
in
him
that
romantic
hope
,
that
a
day
might
come
when
*NL*
she
would
make
avowal
of
her
passion
,
by
which
hope
alone
he
had
become
*NL*
and
would
remain
her
lover
.
And
so
to
alter
,
to
give
a
fresh
moral
*NL*
aspect
to
that
Odette
,
of
whose
unchanging
mood
he
was
afraid
of
growing
*NL*
weary
,
he
wrote
,
suddenly
,
a
letter
full
of
hinted
discoveries
and
*NL*
feigned
indignation
,
which
he
sent
off
so
that
it
should
reach
her
*NL*
before
dinner-time
.
He
knew
that
she
would
be
frightened
,
and
that
she
*NL*
would
reply
,
and
he
hoped
that
,
when
the
fear
of
losing
him
clutched
at
*NL*
her
heart
,
it
would
force
from
her
words
such
as
he
had
never
yet
heard
*NL*
her
utter
:
and
he
was
right
--
by
repeating
this
device
he
had
won
from
*NL*
her
the
most
affectionate
letters
that
she
had
,
so
far
,
written
him
,
one
*NL*
of
them
-LRB-
which
she
had
sent
to
him
at
midday
by
a
special
messenger
from
*NL*
the
Maison
Dor√©e
--
it
was
the
day
of
the
Paris-Murcie
F√™te
given
for
*NL*
the
victims
of
the
recent
floods
in
Murcia
-RRB-
beginning
``
My
dear
,
my
hand
*NL*
trembles
so
that
I
can
scarcely
write
--
''
;
and
these
letters
he
had
*NL*
kept
in
the
same
drawer
as
the
withered
chrysanthemum
.
Or
else
,
if
she
*NL*
had
not
had
time
to
write
,
when
he
arrived
at
the
Verdurins
'
she
would
*NL*
come
running
up
to
him
with
an
``
I
've
something
to
say
to
you
!
''
and
he
*NL*
would
gaze
curiously
at
the
revelation
in
her
face
and
speech
of
what
*NL*
she
had
hitherto
kept
concealed
from
him
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
as
he
drew
near
to
the
Verdurins
'
door
,
and
caught
sight
of
the
*NL*
great
lamp-lit
spaces
of
the
drawing-room
windows
,
whose
shutters
were
*NL*
never
closed
,
he
would
begin
to
melt
at
the
thought
of
the
charming
*NL*
creature
whom
he
would
see
,
as
he
entered
the
room
,
basking
in
that
*NL*
golden
light
.
Here
and
there
the
figures
of
the
guests
stood
out
,
sharp
*NL*
and
black
,
between
lamp
and
window
,
shutting
off
the
light
,
like
those
*NL*
little
pictures
which
one
sees
sometimes
pasted
here
and
there
upon
a
*NL*
glass
screen
,
whose
other
panes
are
mere
transparencies
.
He
would
try
*NL*
to
make
out
Odette
.
And
then
,
when
he
was
once
inside
,
without
thinking
,
*NL*
his
eyes
sparkled
suddenly
with
such
radiant
happiness
that
M.
Verdurin
*NL*
said
to
the
painter
:
``
H
'm
.
Seems
to
be
getting
warm
.
''
Indeed
,
her
*NL*
presence
gave
the
house
what
none
other
of
the
houses
that
he
visited
*NL*
seemed
to
possess
:
a
sort
of
tactual
sense
,
a
nervous
system
which
*NL*
ramified
into
each
of
its
rooms
and
sent
a
constant
stimulus
to
his
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
the
simple
and
regular
manifestations
of
a
social
organism
,
*NL*
namely
the
`
little
clan
,
'
were
transformed
for
Swann
into
a
series
of
*NL*
daily
encounters
with
Odette
,
and
enabled
him
to
feign
indifference
to
*NL*
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
,
or
even
a
desire
not
to
see
her
;
in
doing
*NL*
which
he
incurred
no
very
great
risk
since
,
even
although
he
had
written
*NL*
to
her
during
the
day
,
he
would
of
necessity
see
her
in
the
evening
and
*NL*
accompany
her
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
one
evening
,
when
,
irritated
by
the
thought
of
that
inevitable
dark
*NL*
drive
together
,
he
had
taken
his
other
`
little
girl
'
all
the
way
to
the
*NL*
Bois
,
so
as
to
delay
as
long
as
possible
the
moment
of
his
appearance
at
*NL*
the
Verdurins
'
,
he
was
so
late
in
reaching
them
that
Odette
,
supposing
*NL*
that
he
did
not
intend
to
come
,
had
already
left
.
Seeing
the
room
bare
*NL*
of
her
,
Swann
felt
his
heart
wrung
by
sudden
anguish
;
he
shook
with
the
*NL*
sense
that
he
was
being
deprived
of
a
pleasure
whose
intensity
he
began
*NL*
then
for
the
first
time
to
estimate
,
having
always
,
hitherto
,
had
that
*NL*
certainty
of
finding
it
whenever
he
would
,
which
-LRB-
as
in
the
case
of
*NL*
all
our
pleasures
-RRB-
reduced
,
if
it
did
not
altogether
blind
him
to
its
*NL*
dimensions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
notice
the
face
he
pulled
when
he
saw
that
she
was
n't
here
?
''
M.
*NL*
Verdurin
asked
his
wife
.
``
I
think
we
may
say
that
he
's
hooked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
face
he
pulled
?
''
exploded
Dr.
Cottard
who
,
having
left
the
house
*NL*
for
a
moment
to
visit
a
patient
,
had
just
returned
to
fetch
his
wife
and
*NL*
did
not
know
whom
they
were
discussing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'you
mean
to
say
you
did
n't
meet
him
on
the
doorstep
--
the
loveliest
of
*NL*
Swanns
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
M.
Swann
has
been
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
for
a
moment
.
We
had
a
glimpse
of
a
Swann
tremendously
agitated
.
*NL*
In
a
state
of
nerves
.
You
see
,
Odette
had
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
say
that
she
has
gone
the
`
whole
hog
'
with
him
;
that
she
*NL*
has
`
burned
her
boats
'
?
''
inquired
the
Doctor
cautiously
,
testing
the
*NL*
meaning
of
his
phrases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
not
;
there
's
absolutely
nothing
in
it
;
in
fact
,
between
*NL*
you
and
me
,
I
think
she
's
making
a
great
mistake
,
and
behaving
like
a
*NL*
silly
little
fool
,
which
she
is
,
incidentally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
come
!
''
said
M.
Verdurin
,
``
How
on
earth
do
you
know
that
*NL*
there
's
`
nothing
in
it
'
?
We
have
n't
been
there
to
see
,
have
we
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
have
told
me
,
''
answered
Mme.
Verdurin
with
dignity
.
``
I
may
*NL*
say
that
she
tells
me
everything
.
As
she
has
no
one
else
at
present
,
I
*NL*
told
her
that
she
ought
to
live
with
him
.
She
makes
out
that
she
ca
n't
;
*NL*
she
admits
,
she
was
immensely
attracted
by
him
,
at
first
;
but
he
's
*NL*
always
shy
with
her
,
and
that
makes
her
shy
with
him
.
Besides
,
she
*NL*
does
n't
care
for
him
in
that
way
,
she
says
;
it
's
an
ideal
love
,
*NL*
`
Platonic
,
'
you
know
;
she
's
afraid
of
rubbing
the
bloom
off
--
oh
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
half
the
things
she
says
,
how
should
I
?
And
yet
he
's
exactly
the
*NL*
sort
of
man
she
wants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
to
differ
from
you
,
''
M.
Verdurin
courteously
interrupted
.
``
I
am
*NL*
only
half
satisfied
with
the
gentleman
.
I
feel
that
he
`
poses
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
's
whole
body
stiffened
,
her
eyes
stared
blankly
as
though
*NL*
she
had
suddenly
been
turned
into
a
statue
;
a
device
by
means
of
which
*NL*
she
might
be
supposed
not
to
have
caught
the
sound
of
that
unutterable
*NL*
word
which
seemed
to
imply
that
it
was
possible
for
people
to
`
pose
'
*NL*
in
her
house
,
and
,
therefore
,
that
there
were
people
in
the
world
who
*NL*
`
mattered
more
'
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
,
if
there
is
nothing
in
it
,
I
do
n't
suppose
it
's
because
our
*NL*
friend
believes
in
her
virtue
.
And
yet
,
you
never
know
;
he
seems
to
*NL*
believe
in
her
intelligence
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
heard
the
way
he
*NL*
lectured
her
the
other
evening
about
Vinteuil
's
sonata
.
I
am
devoted
*NL*
to
Odette
,
but
really
--
to
expound
theories
of
aesthetic
to
her
--
the
man
*NL*
must
be
a
prize
idiot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
I
wo
n't
have
you
saying
nasty
things
about
Odette
,
''
broke
in
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
in
her
`
spoiled
child
'
manner
.
``
She
is
charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
reason
why
she
should
n't
be
charming
;
we
are
not
saying
*NL*
anything
nasty
about
her
,
only
that
she
is
not
the
embodiment
of
either
*NL*
virtue
or
intellect
.
After
all
,
''
he
turned
to
the
painter
,
``
does
it
*NL*
matter
so
very
much
whether
she
is
virtuous
or
not
?
You
ca
n't
tell
;
she
*NL*
might
be
a
great
deal
less
charming
if
she
were

''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
landing
Swann
had
run
into
the
Verdurins
'
butler
,
who
had
been
*NL*
somewhere
else
a
moment
earlier
,
when
he
arrived
,
and
who
had
been
asked
*NL*
by
Odette
to
tell
Swann
-LRB-
but
that
was
at
least
an
hour
ago
-RRB-
that
she
*NL*
would
probably
stop
to
drink
a
cup
of
chocolate
at
Pr√©vost
's
on
her
*NL*
way
home
.
Swann
set
off
at
once
for
Pr√©vost
's
,
but
every
few
yards
*NL*
his
carriage
was
held
up
by
others
,
or
by
people
crossing
the
street
,
*NL*
loathsome
obstacles
each
of
which
he
would
gladly
have
crushed
beneath
*NL*
his
wheels
,
were
it
not
that
a
policeman
fumbling
with
a
note-book
would
*NL*
delay
him
even
longer
than
the
actual
passage
of
the
pedestrian
.
He
*NL*
counted
the
minutes
feverishly
,
adding
a
few
seconds
to
each
so
as
to
*NL*
be
quite
certain
that
he
had
not
given
himself
short
measure
,
and
so
,
*NL*
possibly
,
exaggerated
whatever
chance
there
might
actually
be
of
his
*NL*
arriving
at
Pr√©vost
's
in
time
,
and
of
finding
her
still
there
.
And
then
,
*NL*
in
a
moment
of
illumination
,
like
a
man
in
a
fever
who
awakes
from
sleep
*NL*
and
is
conscious
of
the
absurdity
of
the
dream-shapes
among
which
his
*NL*
mind
has
been
wandering
without
any
clear
distinction
between
himself
*NL*
and
them
,
Swann
suddenly
perceived
how
foreign
to
his
nature
were
the
*NL*
thoughts
which
he
had
been
revolving
in
his
mind
ever
since
he
had
heard
*NL*
at
the
Verdurins
'
that
Odette
had
left
,
how
novel
the
heartache
from
*NL*
which
he
was
suffering
,
but
of
which
he
was
only
now
conscious
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
just
woken
up
.
What
!
all
this
disturbance
simply
because
*NL*
he
would
not
see
Odette
,
now
,
till
to-morrow
,
exactly
what
he
had
been
*NL*
hoping
,
not
an
hour
before
,
as
he
drove
toward
Mme.
Verdurin
's
.
He
was
*NL*
obliged
to
admit
also
that
now
,
as
he
sat
in
the
same
carriage
and
*NL*
drove
to
Pr√©vost
's
,
he
was
no
longer
the
same
man
,
was
no
longer
alone
*NL*
even
--
but
that
a
new
personality
was
there
beside
him
,
adhering
to
him
,
*NL*
amalgamated
with
him
,
a
creature
from
whom
he
might
,
perhaps
,
be
unable
*NL*
to
liberate
himself
,
towards
whom
he
might
have
to
adopt
some
such
*NL*
stratagem
as
one
uses
to
outwit
a
master
or
a
malady
.
And
yet
,
during
*NL*
this
last
moment
in
which
he
had
felt
that
another
,
a
fresh
personality
*NL*
was
thus
conjoined
with
his
own
,
life
had
seemed
,
somehow
,
more
*NL*
interesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
he
assured
himself
that
this
possible
meeting
at
*NL*
Pr√©vost
's
-LRB-
the
tension
of
waiting
for
which
so
ravished
,
stripped
so
*NL*
bare
the
intervening
moments
that
he
could
find
nothing
,
not
one
idea
,
*NL*
not
one
memory
in
his
mind
beneath
which
his
troubled
spirit
might
take
*NL*
shelter
and
repose
-RRB-
would
probably
,
after
all
,
should
it
take
place
,
be
*NL*
much
the
same
as
all
their
meetings
,
of
no
great
importance
.
As
on
every
*NL*
other
evening
,
once
he
was
in
Odette
's
company
,
once
he
had
begun
to
*NL*
cast
furtive
glances
at
her
changing
countenance
,
and
instantly
to
*NL*
withdraw
his
eyes
lest
she
should
read
in
them
the
first
symbols
of
*NL*
desire
and
believe
no
more
in
his
indifference
,
he
would
cease
to
*NL*
be
able
even
to
think
of
her
,
so
busy
would
he
be
in
the
search
for
*NL*
pretexts
which
would
enable
him
not
to
leave
her
immediately
,
and
to
*NL*
assure
himself
,
without
betraying
his
concern
,
that
he
would
find
her
*NL*
again
,
next
evening
,
at
the
Verdurins
'
;
pretexts
,
that
is
to
say
,
which
*NL*
would
enable
him
to
prolong
for
the
time
being
,
and
to
renew
for
one
day
*NL*
more
the
disappointment
,
the
torturing
deception
that
must
always
come
*NL*
to
him
with
the
vain
presence
of
this
woman
,
whom
he
might
approach
,
yet
*NL*
never
dared
embrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
at
Prevost
's
;
he
must
search
for
her
,
then
,
in
every
*NL*
restaurant
upon
the
boulevards
.
To
save
time
,
while
he
went
in
one
*NL*
direction
,
he
sent
in
the
other
his
coachman
R√©mi
-LRB-
Rizzo
's
Doge
Loredan
-RRB-
*NL*
for
whom
he
presently
--
after
a
fruitless
search
--
found
himself
waiting
*NL*
at
the
spot
where
the
carriage
was
to
meet
him
.
It
did
not
appear
,
and
*NL*
Swann
tantalised
himself
with
alternate
pictures
of
the
approaching
*NL*
moment
,
as
one
in
which
R√©mi
would
say
to
him
:
``
Sir
,
the
lady
is
there
,
''
*NL*
or
as
one
in
which
R√©mi
would
say
to
him
:
``
Sir
,
the
lady
was
not
in
*NL*
any
of
the
caf√©s
.
''
And
so
he
saw
himself
faced
by
the
close
of
his
*NL*
evening
--
a
thing
uniform
,
and
yet
bifurcated
by
the
intervening
accident
*NL*
which
would
either
put
an
end
to
his
agony
by
discovering
Odette
,
or
*NL*
would
oblige
him
to
abandon
any
hope
of
finding
her
that
night
,
to
*NL*
accept
the
necessity
of
returning
home
without
having
seen
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
returned
;
but
,
as
he
drew
up
opposite
him
,
Swann
asked
,
*NL*
not
``
Did
you
find
the
lady
?
''
but
``
Remind
me
,
to-morrow
,
to
order
in
*NL*
some
more
firewood
.
I
am
sure
we
must
be
running
short
.
''
Perhaps
he
had
*NL*
persuaded
himself
that
,
if
R√©mi
had
at
last
found
Odette
in
some
caf√©
,
*NL*
where
she
was
waiting
for
him
still
,
then
his
night
of
misery
was
*NL*
already
obliterated
by
the
realisation
,
begun
already
in
his
mind
,
of
a
*NL*
night
of
joy
,
and
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
hasten
towards
the
*NL*
attainment
of
a
happiness
already
captured
and
held
in
a
safe
place
,
*NL*
which
would
not
escape
his
grasp
again
.
But
it
was
also
by
the
force
of
*NL*
inertia
;
there
was
in
his
soul
that
want
of
adaptability
which
can
be
*NL*
seen
in
the
bodies
of
certain
people
who
,
when
the
moment
comes
to
avoid
*NL*
a
collision
,
to
snatch
their
clothes
out
of
reach
of
a
flame
,
or
to
*NL*
perform
any
other
such
necessary
movement
,
take
their
time
-LRB-
as
the
*NL*
saying
is
-RRB-
,
begin
by
remaining
for
a
moment
in
their
original
position
,
*NL*
as
though
seeking
to
find
in
it
a
starting-point
,
a
source
of
strength
*NL*
and
motion
.
And
probably
,
if
the
coachman
had
interrupted
him
with
,
*NL*
``
I
have
found
the
lady
,
''
he
would
have
answered
,
``
Oh
,
yes
,
of
course
;
*NL*
that
's
what
I
told
you
to
do
.
I
had
quite
forgotten
,
''
and
would
have
*NL*
continued
to
discuss
his
supply
of
firewood
,
so
as
to
hide
from
his
*NL*
servant
the
emotion
that
he
had
felt
,
and
to
give
himself
time
to
break
*NL*
away
from
the
thraldom
of
his
anxieties
and
abandon
himself
to
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
came
back
,
however
,
with
the
report
that
he
could
not
find
*NL*
her
anywhere
,
and
added
the
advice
,
as
an
old
and
privileged
servant
,
``
I
*NL*
think
,
sir
,
that
all
we
can
do
now
is
to
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
air
of
indifference
which
Swann
could
so
lightly
assume
when
*NL*
R√©mi
uttered
his
final
,
unalterable
response
,
fell
from
him
like
a
*NL*
cast-off
cloak
when
he
saw
R√©mi
attempt
to
make
him
abandon
hope
and
*NL*
retire
from
the
quest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
We
must
find
the
lady
.
It
is
most
*NL*
important
.
She
would
be
extremely
put
out
--
it
's
a
business
matter
--
and
*NL*
vexed
with
me
if
she
did
n't
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
not
see
how
the
lady
can
be
vexed
,
sir
,
''
answered
R√©mi
,
``
since
*NL*
it
was
she
that
went
away
without
waiting
for
you
,
sir
,
and
said
she
was
*NL*
going
to
Pr√©vost
's
,
and
then
was
n't
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
restaurants
were
closing
,
and
their
lights
began
to
go
*NL*
out
.
Under
the
trees
of
the
boulevards
there
were
still
a
few
people
*NL*
strolling
to
and
fro
,
barely
distinguishable
in
the
gathering
darkness
.
*NL*
Now
and
then
the
ghost
of
a
woman
glided
up
to
Swann
,
murmured
a
few
*NL*
words
in
his
ear
,
asked
him
to
take
her
home
,
and
left
him
shuddering
.
*NL*
Anxiously
he
explored
every
one
of
these
vaguely
seen
shapes
,
as
though
*NL*
among
the
phantoms
of
the
dead
,
in
the
realms
of
darkness
,
he
had
been
*NL*
searching
for
a
lost
Eurydice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
all
the
methods
by
which
love
is
brought
into
being
,
among
all
the
*NL*
agents
which
disseminate
that
blessed
bane
,
there
are
few
so
efficacious
*NL*
as
the
great
gust
of
agitation
which
,
now
and
then
,
sweeps
over
the
*NL*
human
spirit
.
For
then
the
creature
in
whose
company
we
are
seeking
*NL*
amusement
at
the
moment
,
her
lot
is
cast
,
her
fate
and
ours
decided
,
*NL*
that
is
the
creature
whom
we
shall
henceforward
love
.
It
is
not
*NL*
necessary
that
she
should
have
pleased
us
,
up
till
then
,
any
more
,
or
*NL*
even
as
much
as
others
.
All
that
is
necessary
is
that
our
taste
for
her
*NL*
should
become
exclusive
.
And
that
condition
is
fulfilled
so
soon
as
--
in
*NL*
the
moment
when
she
has
failed
to
meet
us
--
for
the
pleasure
which
*NL*
we
were
on
the
point
of
enjoying
in
her
charming
company
is
abruptly
*NL*
substituted
an
anxious
torturing
desire
,
whose
object
is
the
creature
*NL*
herself
,
an
irrational
,
absurd
desire
,
which
the
laws
of
civilised
*NL*
society
make
it
impossible
to
satisfy
and
difficult
to
assuage
--
the
*NL*
insensate
,
agonising
desire
to
possess
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
made
R√©mi
drive
him
to
such
restaurants
as
were
still
open
;
it
was
*NL*
the
sole
hypothesis
,
now
,
of
that
happiness
which
he
had
contemplated
*NL*
so
calmly
;
he
no
longer
concealed
his
agitation
,
the
price
he
set
upon
*NL*
their
meeting
,
and
promised
,
in
case
of
success
,
to
reward
his
coachman
,
*NL*
as
though
,
by
inspiring
in
him
a
will
to
triumph
which
would
reinforce
*NL*
his
own
,
he
could
bring
it
to
pass
,
by
a
miracle
,
that
Odette
--
assuming
*NL*
that
she
had
long
since
gone
home
to
bed
,
--
might
yet
be
found
seated
in
*NL*
some
restaurant
on
the
boulevards
.
He
pursued
the
quest
as
far
as
the
*NL*
Maison
Dor√©e
,
burst
twice
into
Tortoni
's
and
,
still
without
catching
*NL*
sight
of
her
,
was
emerging
from
the
Caf√©
Anglais
,
striding
with
haggard
*NL*
gaze
towards
his
carriage
,
which
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
the
Boulevard
des
Italiens
,
when
he
collided
with
a
person
coming
in
the
*NL*
opposite
direction
;
it
was
Odette
;
she
explained
,
later
,
that
there
had
*NL*
been
no
room
at
Pr√©vost
's
,
that
she
had
gone
,
instead
,
to
sup
at
the
*NL*
Maison
Dor√©e
,
and
had
been
sitting
there
in
an
alcove
where
he
must
have
*NL*
overlooked
her
,
and
that
she
was
now
looking
for
her
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
so
little
expected
to
see
him
that
she
started
back
in
alarm
.
As
*NL*
for
him
,
he
had
ransacked
the
streets
of
Paris
,
not
that
he
supposed
*NL*
it
possible
that
he
should
find
her
,
but
because
he
would
have
suffered
*NL*
even
more
cruelly
by
abandoning
the
attempt
.
But
now
the
joy
-LRB-
which
,
his
*NL*
reason
had
never
ceased
to
assure
him
,
was
not
,
that
evening
at
least
,
*NL*
to
be
realised
-RRB-
was
suddenly
apparent
,
and
more
real
than
ever
*NL*
before
;
for
he
himself
had
contributed
nothing
to
it
by
anticipating
*NL*
probabilities
,
--
it
remained
integral
and
external
to
himself
;
there
*NL*
was
no
need
for
him
to
draw
on
his
own
resources
to
endow
it
with
*NL*
truth
--
't
was
from
itself
that
there
emanated
,
't
was
itself
that
*NL*
projected
towards
him
that
truth
whose
glorious
rays
melted
and
*NL*
scattered
like
the
cloud
of
a
dream
the
sense
of
loneliness
which
had
*NL*
lowered
over
him
,
that
truth
upon
which
he
had
supported
,
nay
founded
,
*NL*
albeit
unconsciously
,
his
vision
of
bliss
.
So
will
a
traveller
,
who
has
*NL*
come
down
,
on
a
day
of
glorious
weather
,
to
the
Mediterranean
shore
,
and
*NL*
is
doubtful
whether
they
still
exist
,
those
lands
which
he
has
left
,
let
*NL*
his
eyes
be
dazzled
,
rather
than
cast
a
backward
glance
,
by
the
radiance
*NL*
streaming
towards
him
from
the
luminous
and
unfading
azure
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
climbed
after
her
into
the
carriage
which
she
had
kept
waiting
,
and
*NL*
ordered
his
own
to
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
in
her
hand
a
bunch
of
cattleyas
,
and
Swann
could
see
,
beneath
*NL*
the
film
of
lace
that
covered
her
head
,
more
of
the
same
flowers
*NL*
fastened
to
a
swansdown
plume
.
She
was
wearing
,
under
her
cloak
,
a
*NL*
flowing
gown
of
black
velvet
,
caught
up
on
one
side
so
as
to
reveal
a
*NL*
large
triangular
patch
of
her
white
silk
skirt
,
with
an
`
insertion
,
'
*NL*
also
of
white
silk
,
in
the
cleft
of
her
low-necked
bodice
,
in
which
were
*NL*
fastened
a
few
more
cattleyas
.
She
had
scarcely
recovered
from
the
shock
*NL*
which
the
sight
of
Swann
had
given
her
,
when
some
obstacle
made
the
*NL*
horse
start
to
one
side
.
They
were
thrown
forward
from
their
seats
;
she
*NL*
uttered
a
cry
,
and
fell
back
quivering
and
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
''
he
assured
her
,
``
do
n't
be
frightened
.
''
And
he
slipped
*NL*
his
arm
round
her
shoulder
,
supporting
her
body
against
his
own
;
then
*NL*
went
on
:
``
Whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
utter
a
word
;
just
make
a
sign
,
yes
*NL*
or
no
,
or
you
'll
be
out
of
breath
again
.
You
wo
n't
mind
if
I
put
the
*NL*
flowers
straight
on
your
bodice
;
the
jolt
has
loosened
them
.
I
'm
afraid
*NL*
of
their
dropping
out
;
I
'm
just
going
to
fasten
them
a
little
more
*NL*
securely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
used
to
being
treated
with
so
much
formality
by
men
,
and
*NL*
smiled
as
she
answered
:
``
No
,
not
at
all
;
I
do
n't
mind
in
the
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
,
chilled
a
little
by
her
answer
,
perhaps
,
also
,
to
bear
out
the
*NL*
pretence
that
he
had
been
sincere
in
adopting
the
stratagem
,
or
even
*NL*
because
he
was
already
beginning
to
believe
that
he
had
been
,
exclaimed
:
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
you
must
n't
speak
.
You
will
be
out
of
breath
again
.
You
can
*NL*
easily
answer
in
signs
;
I
shall
understand
.
Really
and
truly
now
,
you
*NL*
do
n't
mind
my
doing
this
?
Look
,
there
is
a
little
--
I
think
it
must
be
*NL*
pollen
,
spilt
over
your
dress
,
--
may
I
brush
it
off
with
my
hand
?
That
's
*NL*
not
too
hard
;
I
'm
not
hurting
you
,
am
I
?
I
'm
tickling
you
,
perhaps
,
a
*NL*
little
;
but
I
do
n't
want
to
touch
the
velvet
in
case
I
rub
it
the
wrong
*NL*
way
.
But
,
do
n't
you
see
,
I
really
had
to
fasten
the
flowers
;
they
would
*NL*
have
fallen
out
if
I
had
n't
.
Like
that
,
now
;
if
I
just
push
them
a
*NL*
little
farther
down
...
Seriously
,
I
'm
not
annoying
you
,
am
I
?
And
if
*NL*
I
just
sniff
them
to
see
whether
they
've
really
lost
all
their
scent
?
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
I
ever
smelt
any
before
;
may
I
?
Tell
the
truth
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
smiling
,
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
ever
so
slightly
,
as
who
*NL*
should
say
,
``
You
're
quite
mad
;
you
know
very
well
that
I
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
slipped
his
other
hand
upwards
along
Odette
's
cheek
;
she
fixed
her
*NL*
eyes
on
him
with
that
languishing
and
solemn
air
which
marks
the
women
*NL*
of
the
old
Florentine
's
paintings
,
in
whose
faces
he
had
found
the
type
*NL*
of
hers
;
swimming
at
the
brink
of
her
fringed
lids
,
her
brilliant
eyes
,
*NL*
large
and
finely
drawn
as
theirs
,
seemed
on
the
verge
of
breaking
from
*NL*
her
face
and
rolling
down
her
cheeks
like
two
great
tears
.
She
bent
her
*NL*
neck
,
as
all
their
necks
may
be
seen
to
bend
,
in
the
pagan
scenes
as
*NL*
well
as
in
the
scriptural
.
And
although
her
attitude
was
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
habitual
and
instinctive
,
one
which
she
knew
to
be
appropriate
to
such
*NL*
moments
,
and
was
careful
not
to
forget
to
assume
,
she
seemed
to
need
all
*NL*
her
strength
to
hold
her
face
back
,
as
though
some
invisible
force
*NL*
were
drawing
it
down
towards
Swann
's
.
And
Swann
it
was
who
,
before
she
*NL*
allowed
her
face
,
as
though
despite
her
efforts
,
to
fall
upon
his
lips
,
*NL*
held
it
back
for
a
moment
longer
,
at
a
little
distance
between
his
*NL*
hands
.
He
had
intended
to
leave
time
for
her
mind
to
overtake
her
body
's
*NL*
movements
,
to
recognise
the
dream
which
she
had
so
long
cherished
and
to
*NL*
assist
at
its
realisation
,
like
a
mother
invited
as
a
spectator
when
*NL*
a
prize
is
given
to
the
child
whom
she
has
reared
and
loves
.
Perhaps
,
*NL*
moreover
,
Swann
himself
was
fixing
upon
these
features
of
an
Odette
not
*NL*
yet
possessed
,
not
even
kissed
by
him
,
on
whom
he
was
looking
now
for
*NL*
the
last
time
,
that
comprehensive
gaze
with
which
,
on
the
day
of
his
*NL*
departure
,
a
traveller
strives
to
bear
away
with
him
in
memory
the
view
*NL*
of
a
country
to
which
he
may
never
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
so
shy
in
approaching
her
that
,
after
this
evening
which
*NL*
had
begun
by
his
arranging
her
cattleyas
and
had
ended
in
her
complete
*NL*
surrender
,
whether
from
fear
of
chilling
her
,
or
from
reluctance
to
*NL*
appear
,
even
retrospectively
,
to
have
lied
,
or
perhaps
because
he
lacked
*NL*
the
audacity
to
formulate
a
more
urgent
requirement
than
this
-LRB-
which
*NL*
could
always
be
repeated
,
since
it
had
not
annoyed
her
on
the
first
*NL*
occasion
-RRB-
,
he
resorted
to
the
same
pretext
on
the
following
days
.
If
*NL*
she
had
any
cattleyas
pinned
to
her
bodice
,
he
would
say
:
``
It
is
most
*NL*
unfortunate
;
the
cattleyas
do
n't
need
tucking
in
this
evening
;
they
've
*NL*
not
been
disturbed
as
they
were
the
other
night
;
I
think
,
though
,
that
*NL*
this
one
is
n't
quite
straight
.
May
I
see
if
they
have
more
scent
than
*NL*
the
others
?
''
Or
else
,
if
she
had
none
:
``
Oh
!
no
cattleyas
this
evening
;
*NL*
then
there
's
nothing
for
me
to
arrange
.
''
So
that
for
some
time
there
*NL*
was
no
change
from
the
procedure
which
he
had
followed
on
that
first
*NL*
evening
,
when
he
had
started
by
touching
her
throat
,
with
his
fingers
*NL*
first
and
then
with
his
lips
,
but
their
caresses
began
invariably
with
*NL*
this
modest
exploration
.
And
long
afterwards
,
when
the
arrangement
-LRB-
or
,
*NL*
rather
,
the
ritual
pretence
of
an
arrangement
-RRB-
of
her
cattleyas
had
*NL*
quite
fallen
into
desuetude
,
the
metaphor
``
Do
a
cattleya
,
''
transmuted
*NL*
into
a
simple
verb
which
they
would
employ
without
a
thought
of
its
*NL*
original
meaning
when
they
wished
to
refer
to
the
act
of
physical
*NL*
possession
-LRB-
in
which
,
paradoxically
,
the
possessor
possesses
nothing
-RRB-
,
*NL*
survived
to
commemorate
in
their
vocabulary
the
long
forgotten
custom
*NL*
from
which
it
sprang
.
And
yet
possibly
this
particular
manner
of
saying
*NL*
``
to
make
love
''
had
not
the
precise
significance
of
its
synonyms
.
*NL*
However
disillusioned
we
may
be
about
women
,
however
we
may
regard
*NL*
the
possession
of
even
the
most
divergent
types
as
an
invariable
*NL*
and
monotonous
experience
,
every
detail
of
which
is
known
and
can
be
*NL*
described
in
advance
,
it
still
becomes
a
fresh
and
stimulating
pleasure
*NL*
if
the
women
concerned
be
--
or
be
thought
to
be
--
so
difficult
as
to
*NL*
oblige
us
to
base
our
attack
upon
some
unrehearsed
incident
in
our
*NL*
relations
with
them
,
as
was
originally
for
Swann
the
arrangement
of
the
*NL*
cattleyas
.
He
trembled
as
he
hoped
,
that
evening
,
-LRB-
but
Odette
,
he
told
*NL*
himself
,
if
she
were
deceived
by
his
stratagem
,
could
not
guess
his
*NL*
intention
-RRB-
that
it
was
the
possession
of
this
woman
that
would
emerge
*NL*
for
him
from
their
large
and
richly
coloured
petals
;
and
the
pleasure
*NL*
which
he
already
felt
,
and
which
Odette
tolerated
,
he
thought
,
perhaps
*NL*
only
because
she
was
not
yet
aware
of
it
herself
,
seemed
to
him
for
that
*NL*
reason
--
as
it
might
have
seemed
to
the
first
man
when
he
enjoyed
it
amid
*NL*
the
flowers
of
the
earthly
paradise
--
a
pleasure
which
had
never
before
*NL*
existed
,
which
he
was
striving
now
to
create
,
a
pleasure
--
and
the
*NL*
special
name
which
he
was
to
give
to
it
preserved
its
identity
--
entirely
*NL*
individual
and
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ice
once
broken
,
every
evening
,
when
he
had
taken
her
home
,
he
must
*NL*
follow
her
into
the
house
;
and
often
she
would
come
out
again
in
her
*NL*
dressing-gown
,
and
escort
him
to
his
carriage
,
and
would
kiss
him
before
*NL*
the
eyes
of
his
coachman
,
saying
:
``
What
on
earth
does
it
matter
what
*NL*
people
see
?
''
And
on
evenings
when
he
did
not
go
to
the
Verdurins
'
-LRB-
which
*NL*
happened
occasionally
,
now
that
he
had
opportunities
of
meeting
Odette
*NL*
elsewhere
-RRB-
,
when
--
more
and
more
rarely
--
he
went
into
society
,
she
would
*NL*
beg
him
to
come
to
her
on
his
way
home
,
however
late
he
might
be
.
The
*NL*
season
was
spring
,
the
nights
clear
and
frosty
.
He
would
come
away
from
*NL*
an
evening
party
,
jump
into
his
victoria
,
spread
a
rug
over
his
knees
,
*NL*
tell
the
friends
who
were
leaving
at
the
same
time
,
and
who
insisted
on
*NL*
his
going
home
with
them
,
that
he
could
not
,
that
he
was
not
going
*NL*
in
their
direction
;
then
the
coachman
would
start
off
at
a
fast
trot
*NL*
without
further
orders
,
knowing
quite
well
where
he
had
to
go
.
His
*NL*
friends
would
be
left
marvelling
,
and
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
Swann
was
*NL*
no
longer
the
same
man
.
No
one
ever
received
a
letter
from
him
now
*NL*
demanding
an
introduction
to
a
woman
.
He
had
ceased
to
pay
any
attention
*NL*
to
women
,
and
kept
away
from
the
places
in
which
they
were
ordinarily
to
*NL*
be
met
.
In
a
restaurant
,
or
in
the
country
,
his
manner
was
deliberately
*NL*
and
directly
the
opposite
of
that
by
which
,
only
a
few
days
earlier
,
*NL*
his
friends
would
have
recognised
him
,
that
manner
which
had
seemed
*NL*
permanently
and
unalterably
his
own
.
To
such
an
extent
does
passion
*NL*
manifest
itself
in
us
as
a
temporary
and
distinct
character
,
which
not
*NL*
only
takes
the
place
of
our
normal
character
but
actually
obliterates
*NL*
the
signs
by
which
that
character
has
hitherto
been
discernible
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
there
was
one
thing
that
was
,
now
,
invariable
,
namely
that
*NL*
wherever
Swann
might
be
spending
the
evening
,
he
never
failed
to
go
on
*NL*
afterwards
to
Odette
.
The
interval
of
space
separating
her
from
him
*NL*
was
one
which
he
must
as
inevitably
traverse
as
he
must
descend
,
by
an
*NL*
irresistible
gravitation
,
the
steep
slope
of
life
itself
.
To
be
frank
,
*NL*
as
often
as
not
,
when
he
had
stayed
late
at
a
party
,
he
would
have
*NL*
preferred
to
return
home
at
once
,
without
going
so
far
out
of
his
way
,
*NL*
and
to
postpone
their
meeting
until
the
morrow
;
but
the
very
fact
of
his
*NL*
putting
himself
to
such
inconvenience
at
an
abnormal
hour
in
order
to
*NL*
visit
her
,
while
he
guessed
that
his
friends
,
as
he
left
them
,
were
*NL*
saying
to
one
another
:
``
He
is
tied
hand
and
foot
;
there
must
certainly
*NL*
be
a
woman
somewhere
who
insists
on
his
going
to
her
at
all
hours
,
''
*NL*
made
him
feel
that
he
was
leading
the
life
of
the
class
of
men
whose
*NL*
existence
is
coloured
by
a
love-affair
,
and
in
whom
the
perpetual
*NL*
sacrifice
which
they
are
making
of
their
comfort
and
of
their
practical
*NL*
interests
has
engendered
a
spiritual
charm
.
Then
,
though
he
may
not
*NL*
consciously
have
taken
this
into
consideration
,
the
certainty
that
she
*NL*
was
waiting
for
him
,
that
she
was
not
anywhere
or
with
anyone
else
,
that
*NL*
he
would
see
her
before
he
went
home
,
drew
the
sting
from
that
anguish
,
*NL*
forgotten
,
it
is
true
,
but
latent
and
ever
ready
to
be
reawakened
,
which
*NL*
he
had
felt
on
the
evening
when
Odette
had
left
the
Verdurins
'
before
*NL*
his
arrival
,
an
anguish
the
actual
cessation
of
which
was
so
agreeable
*NL*
that
it
might
even
be
called
a
state
of
happiness
.
Perhaps
it
was
to
*NL*
that
hour
of
anguish
that
there
must
be
attributed
the
importance
which
*NL*
Odette
had
since
assumed
in
his
life
.
Other
people
are
,
as
a
rule
,
so
*NL*
immaterial
to
us
that
,
when
we
have
entrusted
to
any
one
of
them
the
*NL*
power
to
cause
so
much
suffering
or
happiness
to
ourselves
,
that
person
*NL*
seems
at
once
to
belong
to
a
different
universe
,
is
surrounded
with
*NL*
poetry
,
makes
of
our
lives
a
vast
expanse
,
quick
with
sensation
,
on
*NL*
which
that
person
and
ourselves
are
ever
more
or
less
in
contact
.
Swann
*NL*
could
not
without
anxiety
ask
himself
what
Odette
would
mean
to
him
*NL*
in
the
years
that
were
to
come
.
Sometimes
,
as
he
looked
up
from
his
*NL*
victoria
on
those
fine
and
frosty
nights
of
early
spring
,
and
saw
the
*NL*
dazzling
moonbeams
fall
between
his
eyes
and
the
deserted
streets
,
he
*NL*
would
think
of
that
other
face
,
gleaming
and
faintly
roseate
like
the
*NL*
moon
's
,
which
had
,
one
day
,
risen
on
the
horizon
of
his
mind
and
since
*NL*
then
had
shed
upon
the
world
that
mysterious
light
in
which
he
saw
it
*NL*
bathed
.
If
he
arrived
after
the
hour
at
which
Odette
sent
her
servants
*NL*
to
bed
,
before
ringing
the
bell
at
the
gate
of
her
little
garden
,
*NL*
he
would
go
round
first
into
the
other
street
,
over
which
,
at
the
*NL*
ground-level
,
among
the
windows
-LRB-
all
exactly
alike
,
but
darkened
-RRB-
of
*NL*
the
adjoining
houses
,
shone
the
solitary
lighted
window
of
her
room
.
*NL*
He
would
rap
upon
the
pane
,
and
she
would
hear
the
signal
,
and
answer
,
*NL*
before
running
to
meet
him
at
the
gate
.
He
would
find
,
lying
open
on
the
*NL*
piano
,
some
of
her
favourite
music
,
the
_
Valse
des
Roses
_
,
the
_
Pauvre
*NL*
Fou
_
of
Tagliafico
-LRB-
which
,
according
to
the
instructions
embodied
in
her
*NL*
will
,
was
to
be
played
at
her
funeral
-RRB-
;
but
he
would
ask
her
,
instead
,
*NL*
to
give
him
the
little
phrase
from
Vinteuil
's
sonata
.
It
was
true
that
*NL*
Odette
played
vilely
,
but
often
the
fairest
impression
that
remains
in
*NL*
our
minds
of
a
favourite
air
is
one
which
has
arisen
out
of
a
jumble
*NL*
of
wrong
notes
struck
by
unskilful
fingers
upon
a
tuneless
piano
.
The
*NL*
little
phrase
was
associated
still
,
in
Swann
's
mind
,
with
his
love
for
*NL*
Odette
.
He
felt
clearly
that
this
love
was
something
to
which
there
were
*NL*
no
corresponding
external
signs
,
whose
meaning
could
not
be
proved
by
*NL*
any
but
himself
;
he
realised
,
too
,
that
Odette
's
qualities
were
not
such
*NL*
as
to
justify
his
setting
so
high
a
value
on
the
hours
he
spent
in
*NL*
her
company
.
And
often
,
when
the
cold
government
of
reason
stood
*NL*
unchallenged
,
he
would
readily
have
ceased
to
sacrifice
so
many
of
his
*NL*
intellectual
and
social
interests
to
this
imaginary
pleasure
.
But
the
*NL*
little
phrase
,
as
soon
as
it
struck
his
ear
,
had
the
power
to
liberate
*NL*
in
him
the
room
that
was
needed
to
contain
it
;
the
proportions
of
*NL*
Swann
's
soul
were
altered
;
a
margin
was
left
for
a
form
of
enjoyment
*NL*
which
corresponded
no
more
than
his
love
for
Odette
to
any
external
*NL*
object
,
and
yet
was
not
,
like
his
enjoyment
of
that
love
,
purely
*NL*
individual
,
but
assumed
for
him
an
objective
reality
superior
to
that
*NL*
of
other
concrete
things
.
This
thirst
for
an
untasted
charm
,
the
little
*NL*
phrase
would
stimulate
it
anew
in
him
,
but
without
bringing
him
any
*NL*
definite
gratification
to
assuage
it
.
With
the
result
that
those
parts
*NL*
of
Swann
's
soul
in
which
the
little
phrase
had
obliterated
all
care
*NL*
for
material
interests
,
those
human
considerations
which
affect
all
men
*NL*
alike
,
were
left
bare
by
it
,
blank
pages
on
which
he
was
at
liberty
to
*NL*
inscribe
the
name
of
Odette
.
Moreover
,
where
Odette
's
affection
might
*NL*
seem
ever
so
little
abrupt
and
disappointing
,
the
little
phrase
would
*NL*
come
to
supplement
it
,
to
amalgamate
with
it
its
own
mysterious
essence
.
*NL*
Watching
Swann
's
face
while
he
listened
to
the
phrase
,
one
would
have
*NL*
said
that
he
was
inhaling
an
anaesthetic
which
allowed
him
to
breathe
*NL*
more
deeply
.
And
the
pleasure
which
the
music
gave
him
,
which
was
*NL*
shortly
to
create
in
him
a
real
longing
,
was
in
fact
closely
akin
,
*NL*
at
such
moments
,
to
the
pleasure
which
he
would
have
derived
from
*NL*
experimenting
with
perfumes
,
from
entering
into
contract
with
a
world
*NL*
for
which
we
men
were
not
created
,
which
appears
to
lack
form
because
*NL*
our
eyes
can
not
perceive
it
,
to
lack
significance
because
it
escapes
*NL*
our
intelligence
,
to
which
we
may
attain
by
way
of
one
sense
only
.
Deep
*NL*
repose
,
mysterious
refreshment
for
Swann
,
--
for
him
whose
eyes
,
although
*NL*
delicate
interpreters
of
painting
,
whose
mind
,
although
an
acute
*NL*
observer
of
manners
,
must
bear
for
ever
the
indelible
imprint
of
the
*NL*
barrenness
of
his
life
,
--
to
feel
himself
transformed
into
a
creature
*NL*
foreign
to
humanity
,
blinded
,
deprived
of
his
logical
faculty
,
almost
*NL*
a
fantastic
unicorn
,
a
chimaera-like
creature
conscious
of
the
world
*NL*
through
his
two
ears
alone
.
And
as
,
notwithstanding
,
he
sought
in
the
*NL*
little
phrase
for
a
meaning
to
which
his
intelligence
could
not
descend
,
*NL*
with
what
a
strange
frenzy
of
intoxication
must
he
strip
bare
his
*NL*
innermost
soul
of
the
whole
armour
of
reason
,
and
make
it
pass
,
*NL*
unattended
,
through
the
straining
vessel
,
down
into
the
dark
filter
of
*NL*
sound
.
He
began
to
reckon
up
how
much
that
was
painful
,
perhaps
even
how
*NL*
much
secret
and
unappeased
sorrow
underlay
the
sweetness
of
the
phrase
;
*NL*
and
yet
to
him
it
brought
no
suffering
.
What
matter
though
the
phrase
*NL*
repeated
that
love
is
frail
and
fleeting
,
when
his
love
was
so
strong
!
*NL*
He
played
with
the
melancholy
which
the
phrase
diffused
,
he
felt
it
*NL*
stealing
over
him
,
but
like
a
caress
which
only
deepened
and
sweetened
*NL*
his
sense
of
his
own
happiness
.
He
would
make
Odette
play
him
the
phrase
*NL*
again
,
ten
,
twenty
times
on
end
,
insisting
that
,
while
she
played
,
she
*NL*
must
never
cease
to
kiss
him
.
Every
kiss
provokes
another
.
Ah
,
in
those
*NL*
earliest
days
of
love
how
naturally
the
kisses
spring
into
life
.
How
*NL*
closely
,
in
their
abundance
,
are
they
pressed
one
against
another
;
until
*NL*
lovers
would
find
it
as
hard
to
count
the
kisses
exchanged
in
an
hour
,
*NL*
as
to
count
the
flowers
in
a
meadow
in
May
.
Then
she
would
pretend
to
*NL*
stop
,
saying
:
``
How
do
you
expect
me
to
play
when
you
keep
on
holding
me
?
*NL*
I
ca
n't
do
everything
at
once
.
Make
up
your
mind
what
you
want
;
am
I
to
*NL*
play
the
phrase
or
do
you
want
to
play
with
me
?
''
Then
he
would
become
*NL*
annoyed
,
and
she
would
burst
out
with
a
laugh
which
,
was
transformed
,
as
*NL*
it
left
her
lips
,
and
descended
upon
him
in
a
shower
of
kisses
.
Or
else
*NL*
she
would
look
at
him
sulkily
,
and
he
would
see
once
again
a
face
worthy
*NL*
to
figure
in
Botticelli
's
`
Life
of
Moses
,
'
he
would
place
it
there
,
*NL*
giving
to
Odette
's
neck
the
necessary
inclination
;
and
when
he
had
*NL*
finished
her
portrait
in
distemper
,
in
the
fifteenth
century
,
on
the
*NL*
wall
of
the
Sixtine
,
the
idea
that
she
was
,
none
the
less
,
in
the
room
*NL*
with
him
still
,
by
the
piano
,
at
that
very
moment
,
ready
to
be
kissed
*NL*
and
won
,
the
idea
of
her
material
existence
,
of
her
being
alive
,
would
*NL*
sweep
over
him
with
so
violent
an
intoxication
that
,
with
eyes
starting
*NL*
from
his
head
and
jaws
that
parted
as
though
to
devour
her
,
he
would
*NL*
fling
himself
upon
this
Botticelli
maiden
and
kiss
and
bite
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
And
then
,
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
house
,
not
without
returning
to
*NL*
kiss
her
once
again
,
because
he
had
forgotten
to
take
away
with
him
,
in
*NL*
memory
,
some
detail
of
her
fragrance
or
of
her
features
,
while
he
drove
*NL*
home
in
his
victoria
,
blessing
the
name
of
Odette
who
allowed
him
to
pay
*NL*
her
these
daily
visits
,
which
,
although
they
could
not
,
he
felt
,
bring
*NL*
any
great
happiness
to
her
,
still
,
by
keeping
him
immune
from
the
fever
*NL*
of
jealousy
--
by
removing
from
him
every
possibility
of
a
fresh
outbreak
*NL*
of
the
heart-sickness
which
had
manifested
itself
in
him
that
evening
,
*NL*
when
he
had
failed
to
find
her
at
the
Verdurins
'
--
might
help
him
to
*NL*
arrive
,
without
any
recurrence
of
those
crises
,
of
which
the
first
had
*NL*
been
so
distressing
that
it
must
also
be
the
last
,
at
the
termination
of
*NL*
this
strange
series
of
hours
in
his
life
,
hours
almost
enchanted
,
in
the
*NL*
same
manner
as
these
other
,
following
hours
,
in
which
he
drove
through
a
*NL*
deserted
Paris
by
the
light
of
the
moon
:
noticing
as
he
drove
home
that
*NL*
the
satellite
had
now
changed
its
position
,
relatively
to
his
own
,
*NL*
and
was
almost
touching
the
horizon
;
feeling
that
his
love
,
also
,
was
*NL*
obedient
to
these
immutable
laws
of
nature
,
he
asked
himself
whether
*NL*
this
period
,
upon
which
he
had
entered
,
was
to
last
much
longer
,
whether
*NL*
presently
his
mind
's
eye
would
cease
to
behold
that
dear
countenance
,
*NL*
save
as
occupying
a
distant
and
diminished
position
,
and
on
the
verge
of
*NL*
ceasing
to
shed
on
him
the
radiance
of
its
charm
.
For
Swann
was
finding
*NL*
in
things
once
more
,
since
he
had
fallen
in
love
,
the
charm
that
he
had
*NL*
found
when
,
in
his
adolescence
,
he
had
fancied
himself
an
artist
;
with
*NL*
this
difference
,
that
what
charm
lay
in
them
now
was
conferred
by
Odette
*NL*
alone
.
He
could
feel
reawakening
in
himself
the
inspirations
of
his
*NL*
boyhood
,
which
had
been
dissipated
among
the
frivolities
of
his
later
*NL*
life
,
but
they
all
bore
,
now
,
the
reflection
,
the
stamp
of
a
particular
*NL*
being
;
and
during
the
long
hours
which
he
now
found
a
subtle
pleasure
*NL*
in
spending
at
home
,
alone
with
his
convalescent
spirit
,
he
became
*NL*
gradually
himself
again
,
but
himself
in
thraldom
to
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
her
only
in
the
evenings
,
and
knew
nothing
of
how
she
spent
*NL*
her
time
during
the
day
,
any
more
than
he
knew
of
her
past
;
so
little
,
*NL*
indeed
,
that
he
had
not
even
the
tiny
,
initial
clue
which
,
by
allowing
*NL*
us
to
imagine
what
we
do
not
know
,
stimulates
a
desire
for
knowledge
.
*NL*
And
so
he
never
asked
himself
what
she
might
be
doing
,
or
what
her
life
*NL*
had
been
.
Only
he
smiled
sometimes
at
the
thought
of
how
,
some
years
*NL*
earlier
,
when
he
still
did
not
know
her
,
some
one
had
spoken
to
him
of
a
*NL*
woman
who
,
if
he
remembered
rightly
,
must
certainly
have
been
Odette
,
*NL*
as
of
a
`
tart
,
'
a
`
kept
'
woman
,
one
of
those
women
to
whom
he
still
*NL*
attributed
-LRB-
having
lived
but
little
in
their
company
-RRB-
the
entire
set
of
*NL*
characteristics
,
fundamentally
perverse
,
with
which
they
had
been
,
for
*NL*
many
years
,
endowed
by
the
imagination
of
certain
novelists
.
He
would
*NL*
say
to
himself
that
one
has
,
as
often
as
not
,
only
to
take
the
exact
*NL*
counterpart
of
the
reputation
created
by
the
world
in
order
to
judge
a
*NL*
person
fairly
,
when
with
such
a
character
he
contrasted
that
of
Odette
,
*NL*
so
good
,
so
simple
,
so
enthusiastic
in
the
pursuit
of
ideals
,
so
nearly
*NL*
incapable
of
not
telling
the
truth
that
,
when
he
had
once
begged
her
,
so
*NL*
that
they
might
dine
together
alone
,
to
write
to
Mme.
Verdurin
,
saying
*NL*
that
she
was
unwell
,
the
next
day
he
had
seen
her
,
face
to
face
*NL*
with
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
asked
whether
she
had
recovered
,
blushing
,
*NL*
stammering
,
and
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
revealing
in
every
feature
how
*NL*
painful
,
what
a
torture
it
was
to
her
to
act
a
lie
;
and
,
while
in
her
*NL*
answer
she
multiplied
the
fictitious
details
of
an
imaginary
illness
,
*NL*
seeming
to
ask
pardon
,
by
her
suppliant
look
and
her
stricken
accents
,
*NL*
for
the
obvious
falsehood
of
her
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
certain
days
,
however
,
though
these
came
seldom
,
she
would
call
upon
*NL*
him
in
the
afternoon
,
to
interrupt
his
musings
or
the
essay
on
Vermeer
*NL*
to
which
he
had
latterly
returned
.
His
servant
would
come
in
to
say
that
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cr√©cy
was
in
the
small
drawing-room
.
He
would
go
in
search
of
*NL*
her
,
and
,
when
he
opened
the
door
,
on
Odette
's
blushing
countenance
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
Swann
,
would
appear
--
changing
the
curve
*NL*
of
her
lips
,
the
look
in
her
eyes
,
the
moulding
of
her
cheeks
--
an
*NL*
all-absorbing
smile
.
Once
he
was
left
alone
he
would
see
again
that
*NL*
smile
,
and
her
smile
of
the
day
before
,
another
with
which
she
had
*NL*
greeted
him
sometime
else
,
the
smile
which
had
been
her
answer
,
in
the
*NL*
carriage
that
night
,
when
he
had
asked
her
whether
she
objected
to
his
*NL*
rearranging
her
cattleyas
;
and
the
life
of
Odette
at
all
other
times
,
*NL*
since
he
knew
nothing
of
it
,
appeared
to
him
upon
a
neutral
and
*NL*
colourless
background
,
like
those
sheets
of
sketches
by
Watteau
upon
*NL*
which
one
sees
,
here
and
there
,
in
every
corner
and
in
all
directions
,
*NL*
traced
in
three
colours
upon
the
buff
paper
,
innumerable
smiles
.
But
,
*NL*
once
in
a
while
,
illuminating
a
chink
of
that
existence
which
Swann
*NL*
still
saw
as
a
complete
blank
,
even
if
his
mind
assured
him
that
it
was
*NL*
not
so
,
because
he
was
unable
to
imagine
anything
that
might
occupy
it
,
*NL*
some
friend
who
knew
them
both
,
and
suspecting
that
they
were
in
love
,
*NL*
had
not
dared
to
tell
him
anything
about
her
that
was
of
the
least
*NL*
importance
,
would
describe
Odette
's
figure
,
as
he
had
seen
her
,
that
*NL*
very
morning
,
going
on
foot
up
the
Rue
Abbattucci
,
in
a
cape
trimmed
*NL*
with
skunks
,
wearing
a
Rembrandt
hat
,
and
a
bunch
of
violets
in
her
*NL*
bosom
.
This
simple
outline
reduced
Swann
to
utter
confusion
by
enabling
*NL*
him
suddenly
to
perceive
that
Odette
had
an
existence
which
was
not
*NL*
wholly
subordinated
to
his
own
;
he
burned
to
know
whom
she
had
been
*NL*
seeking
to
fascinate
by
this
costume
in
which
he
had
never
seen
her
;
he
*NL*
registered
a
vow
to
insist
upon
her
telling
him
where
she
had
been
going
*NL*
at
that
intercepted
moment
,
as
though
,
in
all
the
colourless
life
--
a
*NL*
life
almost
nonexistent
,
since
she
was
then
invisible
to
him
--
of
his
*NL*
mistress
,
there
had
been
but
a
single
incident
apart
from
all
those
*NL*
smiles
directed
towards
himself
;
namely
,
her
walking
abroad
beneath
a
*NL*
Rembrandt
hat
,
with
a
bunch
of
violets
in
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Except
when
he
asked
her
for
Vinteuil
's
little
phrase
instead
of
the
*NL*
_
Valse
des
Roses
_
,
Swann
made
no
effort
to
induce
her
to
play
the
things
*NL*
that
he
himself
preferred
,
nor
,
in
literature
any
more
than
in
music
,
to
*NL*
correct
the
manifold
errors
of
her
taste
.
He
fully
realised
that
she
was
*NL*
not
intelligent
.
When
she
said
how
much
she
would
like
him
to
tell
her
*NL*
about
the
great
poets
,
she
had
imagined
that
she
would
suddenly
get
*NL*
to
know
whole
pages
of
romantic
and
heroic
verse
,
in
the
style
of
the
*NL*
Vicomte
de
Borelli
,
only
even
more
moving
.
As
for
Vermeer
of
Delft
,
she
*NL*
asked
whether
he
had
been
made
to
suffer
by
a
woman
,
if
it
was
a
woman
*NL*
that
had
inspired
him
,
and
once
Swann
had
told
her
that
no
one
knew
,
she
*NL*
had
lost
all
interest
in
that
painter
.
She
would
often
say
:
``
I
'm
sure
,
*NL*
poetry
;
well
,
of
course
,
there
'd
be
nothing
like
it
if
it
was
all
true
,
*NL*
if
the
poets
really
believed
the
things
they
said
.
But
as
often
as
not
*NL*
you
'll
find
there
's
no
one
so
mean
and
calculating
as
those
fellows
.
I
*NL*
know
something
about
poetry
.
I
had
a
friend
,
once
,
who
was
in
love
with
*NL*
a
poet
of
sorts
.
In
his
verses
he
never
spoke
of
anything
but
love
,
and
*NL*
heaven
,
and
the
stars
.
Oh
!
she
was
properly
taken
in
!
He
had
more
than
*NL*
three
hundred
thousand
francs
out
of
her
before
he
'd
finished
.
''
If
,
*NL*
then
,
Swann
tried
to
shew
her
in
what
artistic
beauty
consisted
,
how
one
*NL*
ought
to
appreciate
poetry
or
painting
,
after
a
minute
or
two
she
would
*NL*
cease
to
listen
,
saying
:
``
Yes
...
I
never
thought
it
would
be
like
that
.
''
*NL*
And
he
felt
that
her
disappointment
was
so
great
that
he
preferred
to
*NL*
lie
to
her
,
assuring
her
that
what
he
had
said
was
nothing
,
that
he
*NL*
had
only
touched
the
surface
,
that
he
had
not
time
to
go
into
it
all
*NL*
properly
,
that
there
was
more
in
it
than
that
.
Then
she
would
interrupt
*NL*
with
a
brisk
,
``
More
in
it
?
What
?
...
Do
tell
me
!
''
,
but
he
did
not
tell
*NL*
her
,
for
he
realised
how
petty
it
would
appear
to
her
,
and
how
different
*NL*
from
what
she
had
expected
,
less
sensational
and
less
touching
;
he
was
*NL*
afraid
,
too
,
lest
,
disillusioned
in
the
matter
of
art
,
she
might
at
the
*NL*
same
time
be
disillusioned
in
the
greater
matter
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
result
that
she
found
Swann
inferior
,
intellectually
,
to
what
*NL*
she
had
supposed
.
``
You
're
always
so
reserved
;
I
ca
n't
make
you
out
.
''
She
*NL*
marvelled
increasingly
at
his
indifference
to
money
,
at
his
courtesy
*NL*
to
everyone
alike
,
at
the
delicacy
of
his
mind
.
And
indeed
it
happens
,
*NL*
often
enough
,
to
a
greater
man
than
Swann
ever
was
,
to
a
scientist
or
*NL*
artist
,
when
he
is
not
wholly
misunderstood
by
the
people
among
whom
*NL*
he
lives
,
that
the
feeling
in
them
which
proves
that
they
have
been
*NL*
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
intellect
is
created
not
by
any
*NL*
admiration
for
his
ideas
--
for
those
are
entirely
beyond
them
--
but
by
*NL*
their
respect
for
what
they
term
his
good
qualities
.
There
was
also
the
*NL*
respect
with
which
Odette
was
inspired
by
the
thought
of
Swann
's
social
*NL*
position
,
although
she
had
no
desire
that
he
should
attempt
to
secure
*NL*
invitations
for
herself
.
Perhaps
she
felt
that
such
attempts
would
be
*NL*
bound
to
fail
;
perhaps
,
indeed
,
she
feared
lest
,
merely
by
speaking
of
*NL*
her
to
his
friends
,
he
should
provoke
disclosures
of
an
unwelcome
kind
.
*NL*
The
fact
remains
that
she
had
consistently
held
him
to
his
promise
never
*NL*
to
mention
her
name
.
Her
reason
for
not
wishing
to
go
into
society
was
,
*NL*
she
had
told
him
,
a
quarrel
which
she
had
had
,
long
ago
,
with
another
*NL*
girl
,
who
had
avenged
herself
by
saying
nasty
things
about
her
.
``
But
,
''
*NL*
Swann
objected
,
``
surely
,
people
do
n't
all
know
your
friend
.
''
``
Yes
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
see
,
it
's
like
a
spot
of
oil
;
people
are
so
horrid
.
''
Swann
was
*NL*
unable
,
frankly
,
to
appreciate
this
point
;
on
the
other
hand
,
he
knew
*NL*
that
such
generalisations
as
``
People
are
so
horrid
,
''
and
``
A
word
of
*NL*
scandal
spreads
like
a
spot
of
oil
,
''
were
generally
accepted
as
true
;
*NL*
there
must
,
therefore
,
be
cases
to
which
they
were
literally
applicable
.
*NL*
Could
Odette
's
case
be
one
of
these
?
He
teased
himself
with
the
*NL*
question
,
though
not
for
long
,
for
he
too
was
subject
to
that
mental
*NL*
oppression
which
had
so
weighed
upon
his
father
,
whenever
he
was
faced
*NL*
by
a
difficult
problem
.
In
any
event
,
that
world
of
society
which
*NL*
concealed
such
terrors
for
Odette
inspired
her
,
probably
,
with
no
very
*NL*
great
longing
to
enter
it
,
since
it
was
too
far
removed
from
the
world
*NL*
which
she
already
knew
for
her
to
be
able
to
form
any
clear
conception
*NL*
of
it
.
At
the
same
time
,
while
in
certain
respects
she
had
retained
a
*NL*
genuine
simplicity
-LRB-
she
had
,
for
instance
,
kept
up
a
friendship
with
a
*NL*
little
dressmaker
,
now
retired
from
business
,
up
whose
steep
and
dark
*NL*
and
fetid
staircase
she
clambered
almost
every
day
-RRB-
,
she
still
thirsted
*NL*
to
be
in
the
fashion
,
though
her
idea
of
it
was
not
altogether
that
held
*NL*
by
fashionable
people
.
For
the
latter
,
fashion
is
a
thing
that
emanates
*NL*
from
a
comparatively
small
number
of
leaders
,
who
project
it
to
a
*NL*
considerable
distance
--
with
more
or
less
strength
according
as
one
*NL*
is
nearer
to
or
farther
from
their
intimate
centre
--
over
the
widening
*NL*
circle
of
their
friends
and
the
friends
of
their
friends
,
whose
names
*NL*
form
a
sort
of
tabulated
index
.
People
`
in
society
'
know
this
index
by
*NL*
heart
,
they
are
gifted
in
such
matters
with
an
erudition
from
which
they
*NL*
have
extracted
a
sort
of
taste
,
of
tact
,
so
automatic
in
its
operation
*NL*
that
Swann
,
for
example
,
without
needing
to
draw
upon
his
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
world
,
if
he
read
in
a
newspaper
the
names
of
the
people
who
had
*NL*
been
guests
at
a
dinner
,
could
tell
at
once
how
fashionable
the
dinner
*NL*
had
been
,
just
as
a
man
of
letters
,
merely
by
reading
a
phrase
,
can
*NL*
estimate
exactly
the
literary
merit
of
its
author
.
But
Odette
was
one
*NL*
of
those
persons
-LRB-
an
extremely
numerous
class
,
whatever
the
fashionable
*NL*
world
may
think
,
and
to
be
found
in
every
section
of
society
-RRB-
who
do
*NL*
not
share
this
knowledge
,
but
imagine
fashion
to
be
something
of
quite
*NL*
another
kind
,
which
assumes
different
aspects
according
to
the
circle
to
*NL*
which
they
themselves
belong
,
but
has
the
special
characteristic
--
common
*NL*
alike
to
the
fashion
of
which
Odette
used
to
dream
and
to
that
before
*NL*
which
Mme.
Cottard
bowed
--
of
being
directly
accessible
to
all
.
The
other
*NL*
kind
,
the
fashion
of
`
fashionable
people
,
'
is
,
it
must
be
admitted
,
*NL*
accessible
also
;
but
there
are
inevitable
delays
.
Odette
would
say
of
*NL*
some
one
:
``
He
never
goes
to
any
place
that
is
n't
really
smart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
Swann
were
to
ask
her
what
she
meant
by
that
,
she
would
answer
,
*NL*
with
a
touch
of
contempt
,
``
Smart
places
!
Why
,
good
heavens
,
just
fancy
,
*NL*
at
your
age
,
having
to
be
told
what
the
smart
places
are
in
Paris
!
What
*NL*
do
you
expect
me
to
say
?
Well
,
on
Sunday
mornings
there
's
the
Avenue
de
*NL*
l'Imp√©ratrice
,
and
round
the
lake
at
five
o'clock
,
and
on
Thursdays
*NL*
the
Eden-Th√©√¢tre
,
and
the
Hippodrome
on
Fridays
;
then
there
are
the
*NL*
balls
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
balls
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
silly
,
the
balls
people
give
in
Paris
;
the
smart
ones
,
I
mean
.
*NL*
Wait
now
,
Herbinger
,
you
know
who
I
mean
,
the
fellow
who
's
in
one
of
*NL*
the
jobbers
'
offices
;
yes
,
of
course
,
you
must
know
him
,
he
's
one
of
the
*NL*
best-known
men
in
Paris
,
that
great
big
fair-haired
boy
who
wears
*NL*
such
swagger
clothes
;
he
always
has
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
and
a
*NL*
light-coloured
overcoat
with
a
fold
down
the
back
;
he
goes
about
with
*NL*
that
old
image
,
takes
her
to
all
the
first-nights
.
Very
well
!
He
gave
*NL*
a
ball
the
other
night
,
and
all
the
smart
people
in
Paris
were
there
.
*NL*
I
should
have
loved
to
go
!
but
you
had
to
shew
your
invitation
at
the
*NL*
door
,
and
I
could
n't
get
one
anywhere
.
After
all
,
I
'm
just
as
glad
,
*NL*
now
,
that
I
did
n't
go
;
I
should
have
been
killed
in
the
crush
,
and
seen
*NL*
nothing
.
Still
,
just
to
be
able
to
say
one
had
been
to
Herbinger
's
ball
.
*NL*
You
know
how
vain
I
am
!
However
,
you
may
be
quite
certain
that
half
the
*NL*
people
who
tell
you
they
were
there
are
telling
stories
...
But
I
am
*NL*
surprised
that
you
were
n't
there
,
a
regular
`
tip-topper
'
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
made
no
attempt
,
however
,
to
modify
this
conception
of
fashion
;
*NL*
feeling
that
his
own
came
no
nearer
to
the
truth
,
was
just
as
fatuous
,
*NL*
devoid
of
all
importance
,
he
saw
no
advantage
to
be
gained
by
imparting
*NL*
it
to
his
mistress
,
with
the
result
that
,
after
a
few
months
,
she
ceased
*NL*
to
take
any
interest
in
the
people
to
whose
houses
he
went
,
except
*NL*
when
they
were
the
means
of
his
obtaining
tickets
for
the
paddock
at
*NL*
race-meetings
or
first-nights
at
the
theatre
.
She
hoped
that
he
would
*NL*
continue
to
cultivate
such
profitable
acquaintances
,
but
she
had
come
to
*NL*
regard
them
as
less
smart
since
the
day
when
she
had
passed
the
Marquise
*NL*
de
Villeparisis
in
the
street
,
wearing
a
black
serge
dress
and
a
bonnet
*NL*
with
strings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
looks
like
a
pew-opener
,
like
an
old
charwoman
,
darling
!
That
a
*NL*
marquise
!
Goodness
knows
I
'm
not
a
marquise
,
but
you
'd
have
to
pay
me
*NL*
a
lot
of
money
before
you
'd
get
me
to
go
about
Paris
rigged
out
like
*NL*
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
could
she
understand
Swann
's
continuing
to
live
in
his
house
on
the
*NL*
Quai
d'Orl√©ans
,
which
,
though
she
dared
not
tell
him
so
,
she
considered
*NL*
unworthy
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
that
she
claimed
to
be
fond
of
`
antiques
,
'
and
used
to
*NL*
assume
a
rapturous
and
knowing
air
when
she
confessed
how
she
loved
*NL*
to
spend
the
whole
day
`
rummaging
'
in
second-hand
shops
,
hunting
for
*NL*
`
bric-√†-brac
,
'
and
things
of
the
`
right
date
.
'
Although
it
was
a
point
*NL*
of
honour
,
to
which
she
obstinately
clung
,
as
though
obeying
some
old
*NL*
family
custom
,
that
she
should
never
answer
any
questions
,
never
give
*NL*
any
account
of
what
she
did
during
the
daytime
,
she
spoke
to
Swann
once
*NL*
about
a
friend
to
whose
house
she
had
been
invited
,
and
had
found
that
*NL*
everything
in
it
was
`
of
the
period
.
'
Swann
could
not
get
her
to
tell
*NL*
him
what
`
period
'
it
was
.
Only
after
thinking
the
matter
over
she
*NL*
replied
that
it
was
`
mediaeval
'
;
by
which
she
meant
that
the
walls
were
*NL*
panelled
.
Some
time
later
she
spoke
to
him
again
of
her
friend
,
and
*NL*
added
,
in
the
hesitating
but
confident
tone
in
which
one
refers
to
a
*NL*
person
whom
one
has
met
somewhere
,
at
dinner
,
the
night
before
,
of
whom
*NL*
one
had
never
heard
until
then
,
but
whom
one
's
hosts
seemed
to
regard
as
*NL*
some
one
so
celebrated
and
important
that
one
hopes
that
one
's
listener
*NL*
will
know
quite
well
who
is
meant
,
and
will
be
duly
impressed
:
``
Her
*NL*
dining-room
...
is
...
eighteenth
century
!
''
Incidentally
,
she
had
thought
*NL*
it
hideous
,
all
bare
,
as
though
the
house
were
still
unfinished
;
women
*NL*
looked
frightful
in
it
,
and
it
would
never
become
the
fashion
.
She
*NL*
mentioned
it
again
,
a
third
time
,
when
she
shewed
Swann
a
card
with
the
*NL*
name
and
address
of
the
man
who
had
designed
the
dining-room
,
and
whom
*NL*
she
wanted
to
send
for
,
when
she
had
enough
money
,
to
see
whether
he
*NL*
could
not
do
one
for
her
too
;
not
one
like
that
,
of
course
,
but
one
*NL*
of
the
sort
she
used
to
dream
of
,
one
which
,
unfortunately
,
her
little
*NL*
house
would
not
be
large
enough
to
contain
,
with
tall
sideboards
,
*NL*
Renaissance
furniture
and
fireplaces
like
the
Ch√¢teau
at
Blois
.
It
was
*NL*
on
this
occasion
that
she
let
out
to
Swann
what
she
really
thought
of
*NL*
his
abode
on
the
Quai
d'Orl√©ans
;
he
having
ventured
the
criticism
that
*NL*
her
friend
had
indulged
,
not
in
the
Louis
XVI
style
,
for
,
he
went
on
,
*NL*
although
that
was
not
,
of
course
,
done
,
still
it
might
be
made
charming
,
*NL*
but
in
the
`
Sham-Antique
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
have
her
live
,
like
you
,
among
a
lot
of
broken-down
chairs
*NL*
and
threadbare
carpets
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
the
innate
respectability
of
*NL*
the
middle-class
housewife
rising
impulsively
to
the
surface
through
the
*NL*
acquired
dilettantism
of
the
`
light
woman
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
People
who
enjoyed
`
picking-up
'
things
,
who
admired
poetry
,
despised
*NL*
sordid
calculations
of
profit
and
loss
,
and
nourished
ideals
of
honour
*NL*
and
love
,
she
placed
in
a
class
by
themselves
,
superior
to
the
rest
of
*NL*
humanity
.
There
was
no
need
actually
to
have
those
tastes
,
provided
*NL*
one
talked
enough
about
them
;
when
a
man
had
told
her
at
dinner
that
he
*NL*
loved
to
wander
about
and
get
his
hands
all
covered
with
dust
in
the
*NL*
old
furniture
shops
,
that
he
would
never
be
really
appreciated
in
*NL*
this
commercial
age
,
since
he
was
not
concerned
about
the
things
that
*NL*
interested
it
,
and
that
he
belonged
to
another
generation
altogether
,
*NL*
she
would
come
home
saying
:
``
Why
,
he
's
an
adorable
creature
;
so
*NL*
sensitive
!
I
had
no
idea
,
''
and
she
would
conceive
for
him
a
strong
and
*NL*
sudden
friendship
.
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
men
who
,
like
Swann
,
had
*NL*
these
tastes
but
did
not
speak
of
them
,
left
her
cold
.
She
was
obliged
,
*NL*
of
course
,
to
admit
that
Swann
was
most
generous
with
his
money
,
but
she
*NL*
would
add
,
pouting
:
``
It
's
not
the
same
thing
,
you
see
,
with
him
,
''
*NL*
and
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
what
appealed
to
her
imagination
was
not
the
*NL*
practice
of
disinterestedness
,
but
its
vocabulary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
that
,
often
,
he
could
not
give
her
in
reality
the
pleasures
of
*NL*
which
she
dreamed
,
he
tried
at
least
to
ensure
that
she
should
be
happy
*NL*
in
his
company
,
tried
not
to
contradict
those
vulgar
ideas
,
that
bad
*NL*
taste
which
she
displayed
on
every
possible
occasion
,
which
all
the
same
*NL*
he
loved
,
as
he
could
not
help
loving
everything
that
came
from
her
,
*NL*
which
even
fascinated
him
,
for
were
they
not
so
many
more
of
those
*NL*
characteristic
features
,
by
virtue
of
which
the
essential
qualities
*NL*
of
the
woman
emerged
,
and
were
made
visible
?
And
so
,
when
she
was
in
a
*NL*
happy
mood
because
she
was
going
to
see
the
_
Reine
Topaze
_
,
or
when
her
*NL*
eyes
grew
serious
,
troubled
,
petulant
,
if
she
was
afraid
of
missing
the
*NL*
flower-show
,
or
merely
of
not
being
in
time
for
tea
,
with
muffins
and
*NL*
toast
,
at
the
Rue
Royale
tea-rooms
,
where
she
believed
that
regular
*NL*
attendance
was
indispensable
,
and
set
the
seal
upon
a
woman
's
*NL*
certificate
of
`
smartness
,
'
Swann
,
enraptured
,
as
all
of
us
are
,
at
*NL*
times
,
by
the
natural
behaviour
of
a
child
,
or
by
the
likeness
of
a
*NL*
portrait
,
which
appears
to
be
on
the
point
of
speaking
,
would
feel
so
*NL*
distinctly
the
soul
of
his
mistress
rising
to
fill
the
outlines
of
her
*NL*
face
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
going
across
and
welcoming
it
*NL*
with
his
lips
.
``
Oh
,
then
,
so
little
Odette
wants
us
to
take
her
to
the
*NL*
flower-show
,
does
she
?
she
wants
to
be
admired
,
does
she
?
very
well
,
we
*NL*
will
take
her
there
,
we
can
but
obey
her
wishes
.
''
As
Swann
's
sight
was
*NL*
beginning
to
fail
,
he
had
to
resign
himself
to
a
pair
of
spectacles
,
*NL*
which
he
wore
at
home
,
when
working
,
while
to
face
the
world
he
adopted
*NL*
a
single
eyeglass
,
as
being
less
disfiguring
.
The
first
time
that
she
*NL*
saw
it
in
his
eye
,
she
could
not
contain
herself
for
joy
:
``
I
really
do
*NL*
think
--
for
a
man
,
that
is
to
say
--
it
is
tremendously
smart
!
How
nice
you
*NL*
look
with
it
!
Every
inch
a
gentleman
.
All
you
want
now
is
a
title
!
''
she
*NL*
concluded
,
with
a
tinge
of
regret
in
her
voice
.
He
liked
Odette
to
say
*NL*
these
things
,
just
as
,
if
he
had
been
in
love
with
a
Breton
girl
,
he
*NL*
would
have
enjoyed
seeing
her
in
her
coif
and
hearing
her
say
that
she
*NL*
believed
in
ghosts
.
Always
until
then
,
as
is
common
among
men
whose
*NL*
taste
for
the
fine
arts
develops
independently
of
their
sensuality
,
a
*NL*
grotesque
disparity
had
existed
between
the
satisfactions
which
he
would
*NL*
accord
to
either
taste
simultaneously
;
yielding
to
the
seduction
of
*NL*
works
of
art
which
grew
more
and
more
subtle
as
the
women
in
whose
*NL*
company
he
enjoyed
them
grew
more
illiterate
and
common
,
he
would
take
a
*NL*
little
servant-girl
to
a
screened
box
in
a
theatre
where
there
was
some
*NL*
decadent
piece
which
he
had
wished
to
see
performed
,
or
to
an
exhibition
*NL*
of
impressionist
painting
,
with
the
conviction
,
moreover
,
that
an
*NL*
educated
,
`
society
'
woman
would
have
understood
them
no
better
,
but
*NL*
would
not
have
managed
to
keep
quiet
about
them
so
prettily
.
But
,
now
*NL*
that
he
was
in
love
with
Odette
,
all
this
was
changed
;
to
share
her
*NL*
sympathies
,
to
strive
to
be
one
with
her
in
spirit
was
a
task
so
*NL*
attractive
that
he
tried
to
find
satisfaction
in
the
things
that
she
*NL*
liked
,
and
did
find
a
pleasure
,
not
only
in
copying
her
habits
but
in
*NL*
adopting
her
opinions
,
which
was
all
the
deeper
because
,
as
those
habits
*NL*
and
opinions
sprang
from
no
roots
in
her
intelligence
,
they
suggested
*NL*
to
him
nothing
except
that
love
,
for
the
sake
of
which
he
had
preferred
*NL*
them
to
his
own
.
If
he
went
again
to
_
Serge
Panine
_
,
if
he
looked
out
*NL*
for
opportunities
of
going
to
watch
Olivier
M√©tra
conducting
,
it
was
for
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
being
initiated
into
every
one
of
the
ideas
in
Odette
's
*NL*
mind
,
of
feeling
that
he
had
an
equal
share
in
all
her
tastes
.
This
*NL*
charm
of
drawing
him
closer
to
her
,
which
her
favourite
plays
and
*NL*
pictures
and
places
possessed
,
struck
him
as
being
more
mysterious
than
*NL*
the
intrinsic
charm
of
more
beautiful
things
and
places
,
which
appealed
*NL*
to
him
by
their
beauty
,
but
without
recalling
her
.
Besides
,
having
*NL*
allowed
the
intellectual
beliefs
of
his
youth
to
grow
faint
,
until
his
*NL*
scepticism
,
as
a
finished
`
man
of
the
world
,
'
had
gradually
penetrated
*NL*
them
unawares
,
he
held
-LRB-
or
at
least
he
had
held
for
so
long
that
he
had
*NL*
fallen
into
the
habit
of
saying
-RRB-
that
the
objects
which
we
admire
have
*NL*
no
absolute
value
in
themselves
,
that
the
whole
thing
is
a
matter
of
*NL*
dates
and
castes
,
and
consists
in
a
series
of
fashions
,
the
most
vulgar
*NL*
of
which
are
worth
just
as
much
as
those
which
are
regarded
as
the
most
*NL*
refined
.
And
as
he
had
decided
that
the
importance
which
Odette
attached
*NL*
to
receiving
cards
tot
a
private
view
was
not
in
itself
any
more
*NL*
ridiculous
than
the
pleasure
which
he
himself
had
at
one
time
felt
in
*NL*
going
to
luncheon
with
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
so
he
did
not
think
that
the
*NL*
admiration
which
she
professed
for
Monte-Carlo
or
for
the
Righi
was
any
*NL*
more
unreasonable
than
his
own
liking
for
Holland
-LRB-
which
she
imagined
*NL*
as
ugly
-RRB-
and
for
Versailles
-LRB-
which
bored
her
to
tears
-RRB-
.
And
so
he
denied
*NL*
himself
the
pleasure
of
visiting
those
places
,
consoling
himself
with
*NL*
the
reflection
that
it
was
for
her
sake
that
he
wished
to
feel
,
to
like
*NL*
nothing
that
was
not
equally
felt
and
liked
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
everything
else
that
formed
part
of
Odette
's
environment
,
and
was
*NL*
no
more
,
in
a
sense
,
than
the
means
whereby
he
might
see
and
talk
to
her
*NL*
more
often
,
he
enjoyed
the
society
of
the
Verdurins
.
With
them
,
since
,
*NL*
at
the
heart
of
all
their
entertainments
,
dinners
,
musical
evenings
,
*NL*
games
,
suppers
in
fancy
dress
,
excursions
to
the
country
,
theatre
*NL*
parties
,
even
the
infrequent
`
big
evenings
'
when
they
entertained
*NL*
`
bores
,
'
there
were
the
presence
of
Odette
,
the
sight
of
Odette
,
*NL*
conversation
with
Odette
,
an
inestimable
boon
which
the
Verdurins
,
by
*NL*
inviting
him
to
their
house
,
bestowed
on
Swann
,
he
was
happier
in
the
*NL*
little
`
nucleus
'
than
anywhere
else
,
and
tried
to
find
some
genuine
*NL*
merit
in
each
of
its
members
,
imagining
that
his
tastes
would
lead
him
*NL*
to
frequent
their
society
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
Never
daring
to
*NL*
whisper
to
himself
,
lest
he
should
doubt
the
truth
of
the
suggestion
,
*NL*
that
he
would
always
be
in
love
with
Odette
,
at
least
when
he
tried
to
*NL*
suppose
that
he
would
always
go
to
the
Verdurins
'
-LRB-
a
proposition
*NL*
which
,
a
priori
,
raised
fewer
fundamental
objections
on
the
part
of
his
*NL*
intelligence
-RRB-
,
he
saw
himself
for
the
future
continuing
to
meet
Odette
*NL*
every
evening
;
that
did
not
,
perhaps
,
come
quite
to
the
same
thing
as
*NL*
his
being
permanently
in
love
with
her
,
but
for
the
moment
while
he
was
*NL*
in
love
with
her
,
to
feel
that
he
would
not
,
one
day
,
cease
to
see
her
*NL*
was
all
that
he
could
ask
.
``
What
a
charming
atmosphere
!
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
How
entirely
genuine
life
is
to
these
people
!
They
are
far
*NL*
more
intelligent
,
far
more
artistic
,
surely
,
than
the
people
one
knows
.
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
,
in
spite
of
a
few
trifling
exaggerations
which
are
rather
*NL*
absurd
,
has
a
sincere
love
of
painting
and
music
!
What
a
passion
for
*NL*
works
of
art
,
what
anxiety
to
give
pleasure
to
artists
!
Her
ideas
about
*NL*
some
of
the
people
one
knows
are
not
quite
right
,
but
then
their
ideas
*NL*
about
artistic
circles
are
altogether
wrong
!
Possibly
I
make
no
great
*NL*
intellectual
demands
upon
conversation
,
but
I
am
perfectly
happy
talking
*NL*
to
Cottard
,
although
he
does
trot
out
those
idiotic
puns
.
And
as
for
*NL*
the
painter
,
if
he
is
rather
unpleasantly
affected
when
he
tries
to
be
*NL*
paradoxical
,
still
he
has
one
of
the
finest
brains
that
I
have
ever
come
*NL*
across
.
Besides
,
what
is
most
important
,
one
feels
quite
free
there
,
one
*NL*
does
what
one
likes
without
constraint
or
fuss
.
What
a
flow
of
humour
*NL*
there
is
every
day
in
that
drawing-room
!
Certainly
,
with
a
few
rare
*NL*
exceptions
,
I
never
want
to
go
anywhere
else
again
.
It
will
become
more
*NL*
and
more
of
a
habit
,
and
I
shall
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
among
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
the
qualities
which
he
supposed
to
be
an
intrinsic
part
of
*NL*
the
Verdurin
character
were
no
more
,
really
,
than
their
superficial
*NL*
reflection
of
the
pleasure
which
had
been
enjoyed
in
their
society
by
*NL*
his
love
for
Odette
,
those
qualities
became
more
serious
,
more
profound
,
*NL*
more
vital
,
as
that
pleasure
increased
.
Since
Mme.
Verdurin
gave
Swann
,
*NL*
now
and
then
,
what
alone
could
constitute
his
happiness
;
since
,
on
an
*NL*
evening
when
he
felt
anxious
because
Odette
had
talked
rather
more
to
*NL*
one
of
the
party
than
to
another
,
and
,
in
a
spasm
of
irritation
,
would
*NL*
not
take
the
initiative
by
asking
her
whether
she
was
coming
home
,
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
brought
peace
and
joy
to
his
troubled
spirit
by
the
spontaneous
*NL*
exclamation
:
``
Odette
!
You
'll
see
M.
Swann
home
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
;
since
,
*NL*
when
the
summer
holidays
came
,
and
after
he
had
asked
himself
uneasily
*NL*
whether
Odette
might
not
leave
Paris
without
him
,
whether
he
would
still
*NL*
be
able
to
see
her
every
day
,
Mme.
Verdurin
was
going
to
invite
them
*NL*
both
to
spend
the
summer
with
her
in
the
country
;
Swann
,
unconsciously
*NL*
allowing
gratitude
and
self-interest
to
filter
into
his
intelligence
and
*NL*
to
influence
his
ideas
,
went
so
far
as
to
proclaim
that
Mme.
Verdurin
*NL*
was
``
a
great
and
noble
soul
.
''
Should
any
of
his
old
fellow-pupils
in
the
*NL*
Louvre
school
of
painting
speak
to
him
of
some
rare
or
eminent
artist
,
*NL*
``
I
'd
a
hundred
times
rather
,
''
he
would
reply
,
``
have
the
Verdurins
.
''
And
,
*NL*
with
a
solemnity
of
diction
which
was
new
in
him
:
``
They
are
magnanimous
*NL*
creatures
,
and
magnanimity
is
,
after
all
,
the
one
thing
that
matters
,
*NL*
the
one
thing
that
gives
us
distinction
here
on
earth
.
Look
you
,
there
*NL*
are
only
two
classes
of
men
,
the
magnanimous
,
and
the
rest
;
and
I
have
*NL*
reached
an
age
when
one
has
to
take
sides
,
to
decide
once
and
for
all
*NL*
whom
one
is
going
to
like
and
dislike
,
to
stick
to
the
people
one
likes
,
*NL*
and
,
to
make
up
for
the
time
one
has
wasted
with
the
others
,
never
to
*NL*
leave
them
again
as
long
as
one
lives
.
Very
well
!
''
he
went
on
,
with
the
*NL*
slight
emotion
which
a
man
feels
when
,
even
without
being
fully
aware
of
*NL*
what
he
is
doing
,
he
says
something
,
not
because
it
is
true
but
because
*NL*
he
enjoys
saying
it
,
and
listens
to
his
own
voice
uttering
the
words
*NL*
as
though
they
came
from
some
one
else
,
``
The
die
is
now
cast
;
I
have
*NL*
elected
to
love
none
but
magnanimous
souls
,
and
to
live
only
in
an
*NL*
atmosphere
of
magnanimity
.
You
ask
me
whether
Mme.
Verdurin
is
really
*NL*
intelligent
.
I
can
assure
you
that
she
has
given
me
proofs
of
a
nobility
*NL*
of
heart
,
of
a
loftiness
of
soul
,
to
which
no
one
could
possibly
*NL*
attain
--
how
could
they
?
--
without
a
corresponding
loftiness
of
mind
.
*NL*
Without
question
,
she
has
a
profound
understanding
of
art
.
But
it
is
*NL*
not
,
perhaps
,
in
that
that
she
is
most
admirable
;
every
little
action
,
*NL*
ingeniously
,
exquisitely
kind
,
which
she
has
performed
for
my
sake
,
*NL*
every
friendly
attention
,
simple
little
things
,
quite
domestic
and
yet
*NL*
quite
sublime
,
reveal
a
more
profound
comprehension
of
existence
than
*NL*
all
your
textbooks
of
philosophy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
He
might
have
reminded
himself
,
all
the
same
,
that
there
were
various
*NL*
old
friends
of
his
family
who
were
just
as
simple
as
the
Verdurins
,
*NL*
companions
of
his
early
days
who
were
just
as
fond
of
art
,
that
he
knew
*NL*
other
`
great-hearted
creatures
,
'
and
that
,
nevertheless
,
since
he
had
*NL*
cast
his
vote
in
favour
of
simplicity
,
the
arts
,
and
magnanimity
,
he
had
*NL*
entirely
ceased
to
see
them
.
But
these
people
did
not
know
Odette
,
and
,
*NL*
if
they
had
known
her
,
would
never
have
thought
of
introducing
her
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
there
was
probably
not
,
in
the
whole
of
the
Verdurin
circle
,
a
*NL*
single
one
of
the
`
faithful
'
who
loved
them
,
or
believed
that
he
loved
*NL*
them
,
as
dearly
as
did
Swann
.
And
yet
,
when
M.
Verdurin
said
that
he
was
*NL*
not
satisfied
with
Swann
,
he
had
not
only
expressed
his
own
sentiments
,
*NL*
he
had
unwittingly
discovered
his
wife
's
.
Doubtless
Swann
had
too
*NL*
particular
an
affection
for
Odette
,
as
to
which
he
had
failed
to
take
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
daily
into
his
confidence
;
doubtless
the
very
discretion
*NL*
with
which
he
availed
himself
of
the
Verdurins
'
hospitality
,
refraining
,
*NL*
often
,
from
coming
to
dine
with
them
for
a
reason
which
they
never
*NL*
suspected
,
and
in
place
of
which
they
saw
only
an
anxiety
on
his
part
*NL*
not
to
have
to
decline
an
invitation
to
the
house
of
some
`
bore
'
or
*NL*
other
;
doubtless
,
also
,
and
despite
all
the
precautions
which
he
had
*NL*
taken
to
keep
it
from
them
,
the
gradual
discovery
which
they
were
*NL*
making
of
his
brilliant
position
in
society
--
doubtless
all
these
things
*NL*
contributed
to
their
general
annoyance
with
Swann
.
But
the
real
,
the
*NL*
fundamental
reason
was
quite
different
.
What
had
happened
was
that
they
*NL*
had
at
once
discovered
in
him
a
locked
door
,
a
reserved
,
impenetrable
*NL*
chamber
in
which
he
still
professed
silently
to
himself
that
the
*NL*
Princesse
de
Sagan
was
not
grotesque
,
and
that
Cottard
's
jokes
were
*NL*
not
amusing
;
in
a
word
-LRB-
and
for
all
that
he
never
once
abandoned
his
*NL*
friendly
attitude
towards
them
all
,
or
revolted
from
their
dogmas
-RRB-
,
they
*NL*
had
discovered
an
impossibility
of
imposing
those
dogmas
upon
him
,
of
*NL*
entirely
converting
him
to
their
faith
,
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
*NL*
come
across
in
anyone
before
.
They
would
have
forgiven
his
going
to
the
*NL*
houses
of
`
bores
'
-LRB-
to
whom
,
as
it
happened
,
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
*NL*
infinitely
preferred
the
Verdurins
and
all
their
little
`
nucleus
'
-RRB-
had
*NL*
he
consented
to
set
a
good
example
by
openly
renouncing
those
`
bores
'
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
the
`
faithful
.
'
But
that
was
an
abjuration
which
,
as
*NL*
they
well
knew
,
they
were
powerless
to
extort
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
difference
was
there
in
a
`
newcomer
'
whom
Odette
had
asked
them
*NL*
to
invite
,
although
she
herself
had
met
him
only
a
few
times
,
and
on
*NL*
whom
they
were
building
great
hopes
--
the
Comte
de
Forcheville
!
-LRB-
It
*NL*
turned
out
that
he
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
brother-in-law
of
*NL*
Saniette
,
a
discovery
which
filled
all
the
`
faithful
'
with
amazement
:
*NL*
the
manners
of
the
old
palaeographer
were
so
humble
that
they
had
always
*NL*
supposed
him
to
be
of
a
class
inferior
,
socially
,
to
their
own
,
and
*NL*
had
never
expected
to
learn
that
he
came
of
a
rich
and
relatively
*NL*
aristocratic
family
.
-RRB-
Of
course
,
Forcheville
was
enormously
the
`
swell
,
'
*NL*
which
Swann
was
not
or
had
quite
ceased
to
be
;
of
course
,
he
would
never
*NL*
dream
of
placing
,
as
Swann
now
placed
,
the
Verdurin
circle
above
any
*NL*
other
.
But
he
lacked
that
natural
refinement
which
prevented
Swann
from
*NL*
associating
himself
with
the
criticisms
-LRB-
too
obviously
false
to
be
worth
*NL*
his
notice
-RRB-
that
Mme.
Verdurin
levelled
at
people
whom
he
knew
.
As
for
*NL*
the
vulgar
and
affected
tirades
in
which
the
painter
sometimes
indulged
,
*NL*
the
bag-man
's
pleasantries
which
Cottard
used
to
hazard
,
--
whereas
*NL*
Swann
,
who
liked
both
men
sincerely
,
could
easily
find
excuses
for
these
*NL*
without
having
either
the
courage
or
the
hypocrisy
to
applaud
them
,
*NL*
Forcheville
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
on
an
intellectual
level
which
*NL*
permitted
him
to
be
stupified
,
amazed
by
the
invective
-LRB-
without
in
the
*NL*
least
understanding
what
it
all
was
about
-RRB-
,
and
to
be
frankly
delighted
*NL*
by
the
wit
.
And
the
very
first
dinner
at
the
Verdurins
'
at
which
*NL*
Forcheville
was
present
threw
a
glaring
light
upon
all
the
differences
*NL*
between
them
,
made
his
qualities
start
into
prominence
and
precipitated
*NL*
the
disgrace
of
Swann
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
at
this
dinner
,
besides
the
usual
party
,
a
professor
from
*NL*
the
Sorbonne
,
one
Brichot
,
who
had
met
M.
and
Mme.
Verdurin
at
a
*NL*
watering-place
somewhere
,
and
,
if
his
duties
at
the
university
and
his
*NL*
other
works
of
scholarship
had
not
left
him
with
very
little
time
*NL*
to
spare
,
would
gladly
have
come
to
them
more
often
.
For
he
had
that
*NL*
curiosity
,
that
superstitious
outlook
on
life
,
which
,
combined
with
a
*NL*
certain
amount
of
scepticism
with
regard
to
the
object
of
their
studies
,
*NL*
earn
for
men
of
intelligence
,
whatever
their
profession
,
for
doctors
*NL*
who
do
not
believe
in
medicine
,
for
schoolmasters
who
do
not
believe
in
*NL*
Latin
exercises
,
the
reputation
of
having
broad
,
brilliant
,
and
indeed
*NL*
superior
minds
.
He
affected
,
when
at
Mme.
Verdurin
's
,
to
choose
his
*NL*
illustrations
from
among
the
most
topical
subjects
of
the
day
,
when
he
*NL*
spoke
of
philosophy
or
history
,
principally
because
he
regarded
those
*NL*
sciences
as
no
more
,
really
,
than
a
preparation
for
life
itself
,
and
*NL*
imagined
that
he
was
seeing
put
into
practice
by
the
`
little
clan
'
*NL*
what
hitherto
he
had
known
only
from
books
;
and
also
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
because
,
having
had
drilled
into
him
as
a
boy
,
and
having
unconsciously
*NL*
preserved
,
a
feeling
of
reverence
for
certain
subjects
,
he
thought
that
*NL*
he
was
casting
aside
the
scholar
's
gown
when
he
ventured
to
treat
those
*NL*
subjects
with
a
conversational
licence
,
which
seemed
so
to
him
only
*NL*
because
the
folds
of
the
gown
still
clung
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
course
of
the
dinner
,
when
M.
de
Forcheville
,
seated
on
the
*NL*
right
of
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
,
in
the
`
newcomer
's
'
honour
,
had
taken
great
*NL*
pains
with
her
toilet
,
observed
to
her
:
``
Quite
original
,
that
white
*NL*
dress
,
''
the
Doctor
,
who
had
never
taken
his
eyes
off
him
,
so
curious
was
*NL*
he
to
learn
the
nature
and
attributes
of
what
he
called
a
``
de
,
''
and
was
*NL*
on
the
look-out
for
an
opportunity
of
attracting
his
attention
,
so
as
*NL*
to
come
into
closer
contact
with
him
,
caught
in
its
flight
the
adjective
*NL*
'
_
blanche
_
'
and
,
his
eyes
still
glued
to
his
plate
,
snapped
out
,
*NL*
''
_
Blanche
_
?
Blanche
of
Castile
?
''
then
,
without
moving
his
head
,
shot
*NL*
a
furtive
glance
to
right
and
left
of
him
,
doubtful
,
but
happy
on
the
*NL*
whole
.
While
Swann
,
by
the
painful
and
futile
effort
which
he
made
to
*NL*
smile
,
testified
that
he
thought
the
pun
absurd
,
Forcheville
had
shewn
*NL*
at
once
that
he
could
appreciate
its
subtlety
,
and
that
he
was
a
man
of
*NL*
the
world
,
by
keeping
within
its
proper
limits
a
mirth
the
spontaneity
*NL*
of
which
had
charmed
Mme.
Verdurin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
to
say
of
a
scientist
like
that
?
''
she
asked
Forcheville
.
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
talk
seriously
to
him
for
two
minutes
on
end
.
Is
that
the
*NL*
sort
of
thing
you
tell
them
at
your
hospital
?
''
she
went
on
,
turning
to
*NL*
the
Doctor
.
``
They
must
have
some
pretty
lively
times
there
,
if
that
's
*NL*
the
case
.
I
can
see
that
I
shall
have
to
get
taken
in
as
a
patient
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
heard
the
Doctor
speak
of
that
wicked
old
humbug
,
Blanche
of
*NL*
Castile
,
if
I
may
so
express
myself
.
Am
I
not
right
,
Madame
?
''
Brichot
*NL*
appealed
to
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
,
swooning
with
merriment
,
her
eyes
*NL*
tightly
closed
,
had
buried
her
face
in
her
two
hands
,
from
between
*NL*
which
,
now
and
then
,
escaped
a
muffled
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
,
Madame
,
I
would
not
dream
of
shocking
the
*NL*
reverent-minded
,
if
there
are
any
such
around
this
table
,
_
sub
rosa
_
...
*NL*
I
recognise
,
moreover
,
that
our
ineffable
and
Athenian
--
oh
,
how
*NL*
infinitely
Athenian
--
Republic
is
capable
of
honouring
,
in
the
person
of
*NL*
that
obscurantist
old
she-Capet
,
the
first
of
our
chiefs
of
police
.
Yes
,
*NL*
indeed
,
my
dear
host
,
yes
,
indeed
!
''
he
repeated
in
his
ringing
voice
,
*NL*
which
sounded
a
separate
note
for
each
syllable
,
in
reply
to
a
protest
*NL*
by
M.
Verdurin
.
``
The
Chronicle
of
Saint
Denis
,
and
the
authenticity
of
*NL*
its
information
is
beyond
question
,
leaves
us
no
room
for
doubt
on
that
*NL*
point
.
No
one
could
be
more
fitly
chosen
as
Patron
by
a
secularising
*NL*
proletariat
than
that
mother
of
a
Saint
,
who
let
him
see
some
pretty
*NL*
fishy
saints
besides
,
as
Suger
says
,
and
other
great
St.
Bernards
of
the
*NL*
sort
;
for
with
her
it
was
a
case
of
taking
just
what
you
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
gentleman
?
''
Forcheville
asked
Mme.
Verdurin
.
``
He
seems
to
*NL*
speak
with
great
authority
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
n't
know
the
famous
Brichot
?
Why
,
he
's
*NL*
celebrated
all
over
Europe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
Br√©chot
,
is
it
?
''
exclaimed
Forcheville
,
who
had
not
quite
*NL*
caught
the
name
.
``
You
must
tell
me
all
about
him
''
;
he
went
on
,
fastening
*NL*
a
pair
of
goggle
eyes
on
the
celebrity
.
``
It
's
always
interesting
to
*NL*
meet
well-known
people
at
dinner
.
But
,
I
say
,
you
ask
us
to
very
select
*NL*
parties
here
.
No
dull
evenings
in
this
house
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
what
it
is
really
,
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
modestly
.
*NL*
``
They
feel
safe
here
.
They
can
talk
about
whatever
they
like
,
and
the
*NL*
conversation
goes
off
like
fireworks
.
Now
Brichot
,
this
evening
,
is
*NL*
nothing
.
I
've
seen
him
,
do
n't
you
know
,
when
he
's
been
with
me
,
simply
*NL*
dazzling
;
you
'd
want
to
go
on
your
knees
to
him
.
Well
,
with
anyone
else
*NL*
he
's
not
the
same
man
,
he
's
not
in
the
least
witty
,
you
have
to
drag
the
*NL*
words
out
of
him
,
he
's
even
boring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
strange
,
''
remarked
Forcheville
with
fitting
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sort
of
wit
like
Brichot
's
would
have
been
regarded
as
out-and-out
*NL*
stupidity
by
the
people
among
whom
Swann
had
spent
his
early
life
,
*NL*
for
all
that
it
is
quite
compatible
with
real
intelligence
.
And
the
*NL*
intelligence
of
the
Professor
's
vigorous
and
well-nourished
brain
might
*NL*
easily
have
been
envied
by
many
of
the
people
in
society
who
seemed
*NL*
witty
enough
to
Swann
.
But
these
last
had
so
thoroughly
inculcated
into
*NL*
him
their
likes
and
dislikes
,
at
least
in
everything
that
pertained
*NL*
to
their
ordinary
social
existence
,
including
that
annex
to
social
*NL*
existence
which
belongs
,
strictly
speaking
,
to
the
domain
of
*NL*
intelligence
,
namely
,
conversation
,
that
Swann
could
not
see
anything
*NL*
in
Brichot
's
pleasantries
;
to
him
they
were
merely
pedantic
,
vulgar
,
*NL*
and
disgustingly
coarse
.
He
was
shocked
,
too
,
being
accustomed
to
*NL*
good
manners
,
by
the
rude
,
almost
barrack-room
tone
which
this
*NL*
student-in-arms
adopted
,
no
matter
to
whom
he
was
speaking
.
Finally
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
he
had
lost
all
patience
that
evening
as
he
watched
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
welcoming
,
with
such
unnecessary
warmth
,
this
Forcheville
*NL*
fellow
,
whom
it
had
been
Odette
's
unaccountable
idea
to
bring
to
the
*NL*
house
.
Feeling
a
little
awkward
,
with
Swann
there
also
,
she
had
asked
*NL*
him
on
her
arrival
:
``
What
do
you
think
of
my
guest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
,
suddenly
realising
for
the
first
time
that
Forcheville
,
whom
*NL*
he
had
known
for
years
,
could
actually
attract
a
woman
,
and
was
quite
a
*NL*
good
specimen
of
a
man
,
had
retorted
:
``
Beastly
!
''
He
had
,
certainly
,
*NL*
no
idea
of
being
jealous
of
Odette
,
but
did
not
feel
quite
so
happy
as
*NL*
usual
,
and
when
Brichot
,
having
begun
to
tell
them
the
story
of
Blanche
*NL*
of
Castile
's
mother
,
who
,
according
to
him
,
``
had
been
with
Henry
*NL*
Plantagenet
for
years
before
they
were
married
,
''
tried
to
prompt
Swann
*NL*
to
beg
him
to
continue
the
story
,
by
interjecting
``
Is
n't
that
so
,
M.
*NL*
Swann
?
''
in
the
martial
accents
which
one
uses
in
order
to
get
down
to
*NL*
the
level
of
an
unintelligent
rustic
or
to
put
the
`
fear
of
God
'
into
*NL*
a
trooper
,
Swann
cut
his
story
short
,
to
the
intense
fury
of
their
*NL*
hostess
,
by
begging
to
be
excused
for
taking
so
little
interest
in
*NL*
Blanche
of
Castile
,
as
he
had
something
that
he
wished
to
ask
the
*NL*
painter
.
He
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
that
afternoon
to
an
exhibition
of
*NL*
the
work
of
another
artist
,
also
a
friend
of
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
had
*NL*
recently
died
,
and
Swann
wished
to
find
out
from
him
-LRB-
for
he
valued
*NL*
his
discrimination
-RRB-
whether
there
had
really
been
anything
more
in
this
*NL*
later
work
than
the
virtuosity
which
had
struck
people
so
forcibly
in
*NL*
his
earlier
exhibitions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
that
point
of
view
it
was
extraordinary
,
but
it
did
not
seem
to
me
*NL*
to
be
a
form
of
art
which
you
could
call
`
elevated
,
'
''
said
Swann
with
a
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elevated
...
to
the
height
of
an
Institute
!
''
interrupted
Cottard
,
*NL*
raising
his
arms
with
mock
solemnity
.
The
whole
table
burst
out
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
I
tell
you
?
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
to
Forcheville
.
``
It
's
simply
*NL*
impossible
to
be
serious
with
him
.
When
you
least
expect
it
,
out
he
*NL*
comes
with
a
joke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
observed
that
Swann
,
and
Swann
alone
,
had
not
unbent
.
For
one
*NL*
thing
he
was
none
too
well
pleased
with
Cottard
for
having
secured
a
*NL*
laugh
at
his
expense
in
front
of
Forcheville
.
But
the
painter
,
instead
*NL*
of
replying
in
a
way
that
might
have
interested
Swann
,
as
he
would
*NL*
probably
have
done
had
they
been
alone
together
,
preferred
to
win
the
*NL*
easy
admiration
of
the
rest
by
exercising
his
wit
upon
the
talent
of
*NL*
their
dead
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
up
to
one
of
them
,
''
he
began
,
``
just
to
see
how
it
was
done
;
I
*NL*
stuck
my
nose
into
it
.
Yes
,
I
do
n't
think
!
Impossible
to
say
whether
*NL*
it
was
done
with
glue
,
with
soap
,
with
sealing-wax
,
with
sunshine
,
with
*NL*
leaven
,
with
excrem
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
one
make
twelve
!
''
shouted
the
Doctor
,
wittily
,
but
just
too
late
,
*NL*
for
no
one
saw
the
point
of
his
interruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
as
though
it
were
done
with
nothing
at
all
,
''
resumed
the
*NL*
painter
.
``
No
more
chance
of
discovering
the
trick
than
there
is
in
the
*NL*
`
Night
Watch
,
'
or
the
`
Regents
,
'
and
it
's
even
bigger
work
than
either
*NL*
Rembrandt
or
Hals
ever
did
.
It
's
all
there
,
--
and
yet
,
no
,
I
'll
take
my
*NL*
oath
it
is
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
just
as
singers
who
have
reached
the
highest
note
in
their
*NL*
compass
,
proceed
to
hum
the
rest
of
the
air
in
falsetto
,
he
had
to
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
murmuring
,
smiling
the
while
,
as
if
,
after
all
,
there
had
*NL*
been
something
irresistibly
amusing
in
the
sheer
beauty
of
the
painting
:
*NL*
``
It
smells
all
right
;
it
makes
your
head
go
round
;
it
catches
your
*NL*
breath
;
you
feel
ticklish
all
over
--
and
not
the
faintest
clue
to
how
*NL*
it
's
done
.
The
man
's
a
sorcerer
;
the
thing
's
a
conjuring-trick
,
it
's
*NL*
a
miracle
,
''
bursting
outright
into
laughter
,
``
it
's
dishonest
!
''
Then
*NL*
stopping
,
solemnly
raising
his
head
,
pitching
his
voice
on
a
double-bass
*NL*
note
which
he
struggled
to
bring
into
harmony
,
he
concluded
,
``
And
it
's
*NL*
so
loyal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Except
at
the
moment
when
he
had
called
it
``
bigger
than
the
`
Night
*NL*
Watch
,
'
''
a
blasphemy
which
had
called
forth
an
instant
protest
from
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
,
who
regarded
the
`
Night
Watch
'
as
the
supreme
masterpiece
of
*NL*
the
universe
-LRB-
conjointly
with
the
`
Ninth
'
and
the
`
Samothrace
'
-RRB-
,
and
at
*NL*
the
word
``
excrement
,
''
which
had
made
Forcheville
throw
a
sweeping
glance
*NL*
round
the
table
to
see
whether
it
was
`
all
right
,
'
before
he
allowed
his
*NL*
lips
to
curve
in
a
prudish
and
conciliatory
smile
,
all
the
party
*NL*
-LRB-
save
Swann
-RRB-
had
kept
their
fascinated
and
adoring
eyes
fixed
upon
the
*NL*
painter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
so
love
him
when
he
goes
up
in
the
air
like
that
!
''
cried
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
,
the
moment
that
he
had
finished
,
enraptured
that
the
*NL*
table-talk
should
have
proved
so
entertaining
on
the
very
night
that
*NL*
Forcheville
was
dining
with
them
for
the
first
time
.
``
Hallo
,
you
!
''
she
*NL*
turned
to
her
husband
,
``
what
's
the
matter
with
you
,
sitting
there
gaping
*NL*
like
a
great
animal
?
You
know
,
though
,
do
n't
you
,
''
she
apologised
*NL*
for
him
to
the
painter
,
``
that
he
can
talk
quite
well
when
he
chooses
;
*NL*
anybody
would
think
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
listened
to
you
.
*NL*
If
you
had
only
seen
him
while
you
were
speaking
;
he
was
just
drinking
*NL*
it
all
in
.
And
to-morrow
he
will
tell
us
everything
you
said
,
without
*NL*
missing
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
really
,
I
'm
not
joking
!
''
protested
the
painter
,
enchanted
by
the
*NL*
success
of
his
speech
.
``
You
all
look
as
if
you
thought
I
was
pulling
*NL*
your
legs
,
that
it
was
just
a
trick
.
I
'll
take
you
to
see
the
show
,
and
*NL*
then
you
can
say
whether
I
've
been
exaggerating
;
I
'll
bet
you
anything
*NL*
you
like
,
you
'll
come
away
more
`
up
in
the
air
'
than
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
do
n't
suppose
for
a
moment
that
you
're
exaggerating
;
we
only
*NL*
want
you
to
go
on
with
your
dinner
,
and
my
husband
too
.
Give
M.
Biche
*NL*
some
more
sole
,
ca
n't
you
see
his
has
got
cold
?
We
're
not
in
any
hurry
;
*NL*
you
're
dashing
round
as
if
the
house
was
on
fire

Wait
a
little
;
do
n't
*NL*
serve
the
salad
just
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Cottard
,
who
was
a
shy
woman
and
spoke
but
seldom
,
was
not
lacking
,
*NL*
for
all
that
,
in
self-assurance
when
a
happy
inspiration
put
the
right
*NL*
word
in
her
mouth
.
She
felt
that
it
would
be
well
received
;
the
thought
*NL*
gave
her
confidence
,
and
what
she
was
doing
was
done
with
the
object
not
*NL*
so
much
of
shining
herself
,
as
of
helping
her
husband
on
in
his
career
.
*NL*
And
so
she
did
not
allow
the
word
`
salad
,
'
which
Mme.
Verdurin
had
just
*NL*
uttered
,
to
pass
unchallenged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
Japanese
salad
,
is
it
?
''
she
whispered
,
turning
towards
*NL*
Odette
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
in
her
joy
and
confusion
at
the
combination
of
neatness
*NL*
and
daring
which
there
had
been
in
making
so
discreet
and
yet
so
*NL*
unmistakable
an
allusion
to
the
new
and
brilliantly
successful
play
by
*NL*
Dumas
,
she
broke
down
in
a
charming
,
girlish
laugh
,
not
very
loud
,
but
*NL*
so
irresistible
that
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
control
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
lady
?
She
seems
devilish
clever
,
''
said
Forcheville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
not
.
But
we
will
have
one
for
you
if
you
will
all
come
to
*NL*
dinner
on
Friday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
think
me
dreadfully
provincial
,
sir
,
''
said
Mme.
Cottard
to
*NL*
Swann
,
``
but
,
do
you
know
,
I
have
n't
been
yet
to
this
famous
_
Francillon
_
*NL*
that
everybody
's
talking
about
.
The
Doctor
has
been
-LRB-
I
remember
now
,
*NL*
he
told
me
what
a
very
great
pleasure
it
had
been
to
him
to
spend
the
*NL*
evening
with
you
there
-RRB-
and
I
must
confess
,
I
do
n't
see
much
sense
in
*NL*
spending
money
on
seats
for
him
to
take
me
,
when
he
's
seen
the
play
*NL*
already
.
Of
course
an
evening
at
the
Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais
is
never
wasted
,
*NL*
really
;
the
acting
's
so
good
there
always
;
but
we
have
some
very
nice
*NL*
friends
,
''
-LRB-
Mme.
Cottard
would
hardly
ever
utter
a
proper
name
,
but
*NL*
restricted
herself
to
``
some
friends
of
ours
''
or
``
one
of
my
friends
,
''
as
*NL*
being
more
`
distinguished
,
'
speaking
in
an
affected
tone
and
with
all
*NL*
the
importance
of
a
person
who
need
give
names
only
when
she
chooses
-RRB-
*NL*
``
who
often
have
a
box
,
and
are
kind
enough
to
take
us
to
all
the
*NL*
new
pieces
that
are
worth
going
to
,
and
so
I
'm
certain
to
see
this
*NL*
_
Francillon
_
sooner
or
later
,
and
then
I
shall
know
what
to
think
.
But
I
*NL*
do
feel
such
a
fool
about
it
,
I
must
confess
,
for
,
whenever
I
pay
a
*NL*
call
anywhere
,
I
find
everybody
talking
--
it
's
only
natural
--
about
that
*NL*
wretched
Japanese
salad
.
Really
and
truly
,
one
's
beginning
to
get
just
a
*NL*
little
tired
of
hearing
about
it
,
''
she
went
on
,
seeing
that
Swann
seemed
*NL*
less
interested
than
she
had
hoped
in
so
burning
a
topic
.
``
I
must
admit
,
*NL*
though
,
that
it
's
sometimes
quite
amusing
,
the
way
they
joke
about
it
:
*NL*
I
've
got
a
friend
,
now
,
who
is
most
original
,
though
she
's
really
a
*NL*
beautiful
woman
,
most
popular
in
society
,
goes
everywhere
,
and
she
tells
*NL*
me
that
she
got
her
cook
to
make
one
of
these
Japanese
salads
,
putting
*NL*
in
everything
that
young
M.
Dumas
says
you
're
to
put
in
,
in
the
play
.
*NL*
Then
she
asked
just
a
few
friends
to
come
and
taste
it
.
I
was
not
among
*NL*
the
favoured
few
,
I
'm
sorry
to
say
.
But
she
told
us
all
about
it
on
her
*NL*
next
`
day
'
;
it
seems
it
was
quite
horrible
,
she
made
us
all
laugh
*NL*
till
we
cried
.
I
do
n't
know
;
perhaps
it
was
the
way
she
told
it
,
''
Mme.
*NL*
Cottard
added
doubtfully
,
seeing
that
Swann
still
looked
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
imagining
that
it
was
,
perhaps
,
because
he
had
not
been
amused
by
*NL*
_
Francillon
_
:
``
Well
,
I
daresay
I
shall
be
disappointed
with
it
,
after
*NL*
all
.
I
do
n't
suppose
it
's
as
good
as
the
piece
Mme.
de
Cr√©cy
worships
,
*NL*
_
Serge
Panine
_
.
There
's
a
play
,
if
you
like
;
so
deep
,
makes
you
*NL*
think
!
But
just
fancy
giving
a
receipt
for
a
salad
on
the
stage
of
the
*NL*
Th√©√¢tre-Fran√ßais
!
Now
,
_
Serge
Panine
_
--
!
But
then
,
it
's
like
everything
*NL*
that
comes
from
the
pen
of
M.
Georges
Ohnet
,
it
's
so
well
written
.
I
*NL*
wonder
if
you
know
the
_
Ma√Ætre
des
Forges
_
,
which
I
like
even
better
*NL*
than
_
Serge
Panine
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
''
said
Swann
with
polite
irony
,
``
but
I
can
assure
you
that
*NL*
my
want
of
admiration
is
almost
equally
divided
between
those
*NL*
masterpieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
now
;
that
's
very
interesting
.
And
what
do
n't
you
like
about
*NL*
them
?
Wo
n't
you
ever
change
your
mind
?
Perhaps
you
think
he
's
a
little
*NL*
too
sad
.
Well
,
well
,
what
I
always
say
is
,
one
should
never
argue
about
*NL*
plays
or
novels
.
Everyone
has
his
own
way
of
looking
at
things
,
and
what
*NL*
may
be
horrible
to
you
is
,
perhaps
,
just
what
I
like
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
interrupted
by
Forcheville
's
addressing
Swann
.
What
had
happened
*NL*
was
that
,
while
Mme.
Cottard
was
discussing
_
Francillon
_
,
Forcheville
*NL*
had
been
expressing
to
Mme.
Verdurin
his
admiration
for
what
he
called
*NL*
the
``
little
speech
''
of
the
painter
.
``
Your
friend
has
such
a
flow
of
*NL*
language
,
such
a
memory
!
''
he
had
said
to
her
when
the
painter
had
*NL*
come
to
a
standstill
,
``
I
've
seldom
seen
anything
like
it
.
He
'd
make
a
*NL*
first-rate
preacher
.
By
Jove
,
I
wish
I
was
like
that
.
What
with
him
and
*NL*
M.
Br√©chot
you
've
drawn
two
lucky
numbers
to-night
;
though
I
'm
not
so
*NL*
sure
that
,
simply
as
a
speaker
,
this
one
does
n't
knock
spots
off
the
*NL*
Professor
.
It
comes
more
naturally
with
him
,
less
like
reading
from
a
*NL*
book
.
Of
course
,
the
way
he
goes
on
,
he
does
use
some
words
that
are
*NL*
a
bit
realistic
,
and
all
that
;
but
that
's
quite
the
thing
nowadays
;
*NL*
anyhow
,
it
's
not
often
I
've
seen
a
man
hold
the
floor
as
cleverly
as
*NL*
that
,
`
hold
the
spittoon
,
'
as
we
used
to
say
in
the
regiment
,
where
,
by
*NL*
the
way
,
we
had
a
man
he
rather
reminds
me
of
.
You
could
take
anything
*NL*
you
liked
--
I
do
n't
know
what
--
this
glass
,
say
;
and
he
'd
talk
away
about
*NL*
it
for
hours
;
no
,
not
this
glass
;
that
's
a
silly
thing
to
say
,
I
'm
*NL*
sorry
;
but
something
a
little
bigger
,
like
the
battle
of
Waterloo
,
or
*NL*
anything
of
that
sort
,
he
'd
tell
you
things
you
simply
would
n't
believe
.
*NL*
Why
,
Swann
was
in
the
regiment
then
;
he
must
have
known
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
much
of
M.
Swann
?
''
asked
Mme.
Verdurin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no
!
''
he
answered
,
and
then
,
thinking
that
if
he
made
himself
*NL*
pleasant
to
Swann
he
might
find
favour
with
Odette
,
he
decided
to
*NL*
take
this
opportunity
of
flattering
him
by
speaking
of
his
fashionable
*NL*
friends
,
but
speaking
as
a
man
of
the
world
himself
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
good-natured
criticism
,
and
not
as
though
he
were
congratulating
Swann
*NL*
upon
some
undeserved
good
fortune
:
``
Is
n't
that
so
,
Swann
?
I
never
see
*NL*
anything
of
you
,
do
I
?
--
But
then
,
where
on
earth
is
one
to
see
him
?
The
*NL*
creature
spends
all
his
time
shut
up
with
the
La
Tr√©mo√Ølles
,
with
the
*NL*
Laumes
and
all
that
lot
!
''
The
imputation
would
have
been
false
at
any
*NL*
time
,
and
was
all
the
more
so
,
now
that
for
at
least
a
year
Swann
had
*NL*
given
up
going
to
almost
any
house
but
the
Verdurins
'
.
But
the
mere
*NL*
names
of
families
whom
the
Verdurins
did
not
know
were
received
by
them
*NL*
in
a
reproachful
silence
.
M.
Verdurin
,
dreading
the
painful
impression
*NL*
which
the
mention
of
these
`
bores
,
'
especially
when
flung
at
her
in
this
*NL*
tactless
fashion
,
and
in
front
of
all
the
`
faithful
,
'
was
bound
to
*NL*
make
on
his
wife
,
cast
a
covert
glance
at
her
,
instinct
with
anxious
*NL*
solicitude
.
He
saw
then
that
in
her
fixed
resolution
to
take
no
notice
,
*NL*
to
have
escaped
contact
,
altogether
,
with
the
news
which
had
just
been
*NL*
addressed
to
her
,
not
merely
to
remain
dumb
but
to
have
been
deaf
*NL*
as
well
,
as
we
pretend
to
be
when
a
friend
who
has
been
in
the
wrong
*NL*
attempts
to
slip
into
his
conversation
some
excuse
which
we
should
*NL*
appear
to
be
accepting
,
should
we
appear
to
have
heard
it
without
*NL*
protesting
,
or
when
some
one
utters
the
name
of
an
enemy
,
the
very
*NL*
mention
of
whom
in
our
presence
is
forbidden
;
Mme.
Verdurin
,
so
that
*NL*
her
silence
should
have
the
appearance
,
not
of
consent
but
of
the
*NL*
unconscious
silence
which
inanimate
objects
preserve
,
had
suddenly
*NL*
emptied
her
face
of
all
life
,
of
all
mobility
;
her
rounded
forehead
was
*NL*
nothing
,
now
,
but
an
exquisite
study
in
high
relief
,
which
the
name
of
*NL*
those
La
Tr√©mo√Ølles
,
with
whom
Swann
was
always
`
shut
up
,
'
had
failed
*NL*
to
penetrate
;
her
nose
,
just
perceptibly
wrinkled
in
a
frown
,
exposed
to
*NL*
view
two
dark
cavities
that
were
,
surely
,
modelled
from
life
.
You
would
*NL*
have
said
that
her
half-opened
lips
were
just
about
to
speak
.
It
was
*NL*
all
no
more
,
however
,
than
a
wax
cast
,
a
mask
in
plaster
,
the
sculptor
's
*NL*
design
for
a
monument
,
a
bust
to
be
exhibited
in
the
Palace
of
Industry
,
*NL*
where
the
public
would
most
certainly
gather
in
front
of
it
and
marvel
*NL*
to
see
how
the
sculptor
,
in
expressing
the
unchallengeable
dignity
of
*NL*
the
Verdurins
,
as
opposed
to
that
of
the
La
Tr√©mo√Ølles
or
Laumes
,
whose
*NL*
equals
-LRB-
if
not
,
indeed
,
their
betters
-RRB-
they
were
,
and
the
equals
and
*NL*
betters
of
all
other
`
bores
'
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
,
had
managed
to
*NL*
invest
with
a
majesty
that
was
almost
Papal
the
whiteness
and
rigidity
*NL*
of
his
stone
.
But
the
marble
at
last
grew
animated
and
let
it
be
*NL*
understood
that
it
did
n't
do
to
be
at
all
squeamish
if
one
went
to
that
*NL*
house
,
since
the
woman
was
always
tipsy
and
the
husband
so
uneducated
*NL*
that
he
called
a
corridor
a
`
collidor
'
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
need
to
pay
me
a
lot
of
money
before
I
'd
let
any
of
that
lot
set
*NL*
foot
inside
my
house
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
concluded
,
gazing
imperially
down
*NL*
on
Swann
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
scarcely
have
expected
him
to
capitulate
so
completely
as
to
*NL*
echo
the
holy
simplicity
of
the
pianist
's
aunt
,
who
at
once
exclaimed
:
*NL*
``
To
think
of
that
,
now
!
What
surprises
me
is
that
they
can
get
anybody
*NL*
to
go
near
them
;
I
'm
sure
I
should
be
afraid
;
one
ca
n't
be
too
careful
.
*NL*
How
can
people
be
so
common
as
to
go
running
after
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
might
,
at
least
,
have
replied
,
like
Forcheville
:
``
Gad
,
she
's
a
*NL*
duchess
;
there
are
still
plenty
of
people
who
are
impressed
by
that
sort
*NL*
of
thing
,
''
which
would
at
least
have
permitted
Mme.
Verdurin
the
final
*NL*
retort
,
``
And
a
lot
of
good
may
it
do
them
!
''
Instead
of
which
,
Swann
*NL*
merely
smiled
,
in
a
manner
which
shewed
,
quite
clearly
,
that
he
could
*NL*
not
,
of
course
,
take
such
an
absurd
suggestion
seriously
.
M.
Verdurin
,
*NL*
who
was
still
casting
furtive
and
intermittent
glances
at
his
wife
,
*NL*
could
see
with
regret
,
and
could
understand
only
too
well
that
she
was
*NL*
now
inflamed
with
the
passion
of
a
Grand
Inquisitor
who
can
not
succeed
*NL*
in
stamping
out
a
heresy
;
and
so
,
in
the
hope
of
bringing
Swann
round
*NL*
to
a
retractation
-LRB-
for
the
courage
of
one
's
opinions
is
always
a
form
of
*NL*
calculating
cowardice
in
the
eyes
of
the
`
other
side
'
-RRB-
,
he
broke
in
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
us
frankly
,
now
,
what
you
think
of
them
yourself
.
We
sha
n't
repeat
*NL*
it
to
them
,
you
may
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Swann
answered
:
``
Why
,
I
'm
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
the
*NL*
Duchess
-LRB-
if
it
is
of
the
La
Tr√©mo√Ølles
that
you
're
speaking
-RRB-
.
I
can
*NL*
assure
you
that
everyone
likes
going
to
see
her
.
I
do
n't
go
so
far
as
*NL*
to
say
that
she
's
at
all
`
deep
'
--
''
he
pronounced
the
word
as
if
it
meant
*NL*
something
ridiculous
,
for
his
speech
kept
the
traces
of
certain
mental
*NL*
habits
which
the
recent
change
in
his
life
,
a
rejuvenation
illustrated
*NL*
by
his
passion
for
music
,
had
inclined
him
temporarily
to
discard
,
*NL*
so
that
at
times
he
would
actually
state
his
views
with
considerable
*NL*
warmth
--
``
but
I
am
quite
sincere
when
I
say
that
she
is
intelligent
,
*NL*
while
her
husband
is
positively
a
bookworm
.
They
are
charming
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
explanation
was
terribly
effective
;
Mme.
Verdurin
now
realised
that
*NL*
this
one
state
of
unbelief
would
prevent
her
`
little
nucleus
'
from
ever
*NL*
attaining
to
complete
unanimity
,
and
was
unable
to
restrain
herself
,
in
*NL*
her
fury
at
the
obstinacy
of
this
wretch
who
could
not
see
what
anguish
*NL*
his
words
were
causing
her
,
but
cried
aloud
,
from
the
depths
of
her
*NL*
tortured
heart
,
``
You
may
think
so
if
you
wish
,
but
at
least
you
need
not
*NL*
say
so
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
all
depends
upon
what
you
call
intelligence
.
''
Forcheville
felt
that
*NL*
it
was
his
turn
to
be
brilliant
.
``
Come
now
,
Swann
,
tell
us
what
you
mean
*NL*
by
intelligence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
cried
Odette
,
``
that
's
one
of
the
big
things
I
beg
him
to
tell
*NL*
me
about
,
and
he
never
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
...
''
protested
Swann
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
nonsense
!
''
said
Odette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
water-butt
?
''
asked
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
you
,
''
pursued
Forcheville
,
``
does
intelligence
mean
what
they
call
*NL*
clever
talk
;
you
know
,
the
sort
of
people
who
worm
their
way
into
*NL*
society
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finish
your
sweet
,
so
that
they
can
take
your
plate
away
!
''
said
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
sourly
to
Saniette
,
who
was
lost
in
thought
and
had
stopped
*NL*
eating
.
And
then
,
perhaps
a
little
ashamed
of
her
rudeness
,
``
It
does
n't
*NL*
matter
;
take
your
time
about
it
;
there
's
no
hurry
;
I
only
reminded
you
*NL*
because
of
the
others
,
you
know
;
it
keeps
the
servants
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
,
''
began
Brichot
,
with
a
resonant
smack
upon
every
syllable
,
``
a
*NL*
rather
curious
definition
of
intelligence
by
that
pleasing
old
anarchist
*NL*
F√©nelon
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
listen
to
this
!
''
Mme.
Verdurin
rallied
Forcheville
and
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
``
He
's
going
to
give
us
F√©nelon
's
definition
of
intelligence
.
That
's
*NL*
interesting
.
It
's
not
often
you
get
a
chance
of
hearing
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Brichot
was
keeping
F√©nelon
's
definition
until
Swann
should
*NL*
have
given
his
own
.
Swann
remained
silent
,
and
,
by
this
fresh
act
of
*NL*
recreancy
,
spoiled
the
brilliant
tournament
of
dialectic
which
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
was
rejoicing
at
being
able
to
offer
to
Forcheville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
it
's
just
the
same
as
with
me
!
''
Odette
was
peevish
.
``
I
'm
not
*NL*
at
all
sorry
to
see
that
I
'm
not
the
only
one
he
does
n't
find
quite
up
*NL*
to
his
level
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
de
La
Tr√©mouailles
whom
Mme.
Verdurin
has
exhibited
to
us
as
so
*NL*
little
to
be
desired
,
''
inquired
Brichot
,
articulating
vigorously
,
``
are
*NL*
they
,
by
any
chance
,
descended
from
the
couple
whom
that
worthy
old
*NL*
snob
,
S√©vign√©
,
said
she
was
delighted
to
know
,
because
it
was
so
good
*NL*
for
her
peasants
?
True
,
the
Marquise
had
another
reason
,
which
in
her
*NL*
case
probably
came
first
,
for
she
was
a
thorough
journalist
at
heart
,
*NL*
and
always
on
the
look-out
for
`
copy
.
'
And
,
in
the
journal
which
she
*NL*
used
to
send
regularly
to
her
daughter
,
it
was
Mme.
de
La
Tr√©mouaille
,
*NL*
kept
well-informed
through
all
her
grand
connections
,
who
supplied
the
*NL*
foreign
politics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no
.
I
'm
quite
sure
they
are
n't
the
same
family
,
''
said
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
desperately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Saniette
who
,
ever
since
he
had
surrendered
his
untouched
plate
to
the
*NL*
butler
,
had
been
plunged
once
more
in
silent
meditation
,
emerged
finally
*NL*
to
tell
them
,
with
a
nervous
laugh
,
a
story
of
how
he
had
once
dined
*NL*
with
the
Duc
de
La
Tr√©mo√Ølle
,
the
point
of
which
was
that
the
Duke
*NL*
did
not
know
that
George
Sand
was
the
pseudonym
of
a
woman
.
Swann
,
*NL*
who
really
liked
Saniette
,
felt
bound
to
supply
him
with
a
few
facts
*NL*
illustrative
of
the
Duke
's
culture
,
which
would
prove
that
such
*NL*
ignorance
on
his
part
was
literally
impossible
;
but
suddenly
he
stopped
*NL*
short
;
he
had
realised
,
as
he
was
speaking
,
that
Saniette
needed
no
*NL*
proof
,
but
knew
already
that
the
story
was
untrue
for
the
simple
reason
*NL*
that
he
had
at
that
moment
invented
it
.
The
worthy
man
suffered
acutely
*NL*
from
the
Verdurins
'
always
finding
him
so
dull
;
and
as
he
was
conscious
*NL*
of
having
been
more
than
ordinarily
morose
this
evening
,
he
had
made
up
*NL*
his
mind
that
he
would
succeed
in
being
amusing
,
at
least
once
,
before
*NL*
the
end
of
dinner
.
He
surrendered
so
quickly
,
looked
so
wretched
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
his
castle
in
ruins
,
and
replied
in
so
craven
a
tone
to
Swann
,
*NL*
appealing
to
him
not
to
persist
in
a
refutation
which
was
already
*NL*
superfluous
,
``
All
right
;
all
right
;
anyhow
,
even
if
I
have
made
a
*NL*
mistake
that
's
not
a
crime
,
I
hope
,
''
that
Swann
longed
to
be
able
*NL*
to
console
him
by
insisting
that
the
story
was
indubitably
true
and
*NL*
exquisitely
funny
.
The
Doctor
,
who
had
been
listening
,
had
an
idea
that
*NL*
it
was
the
right
moment
to
interject
''
_
Se
non
√®
vero
_
,
''
but
he
was
not
*NL*
quite
certain
of
the
words
,
and
was
afraid
of
being
caught
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
Forcheville
went
up
to
the
Doctor
.
``
She
ca
n't
have
been
*NL*
at
all
bad
looking
,
Mme.
Verdurin
;
anyhow
,
she
's
a
woman
you
can
really
*NL*
talk
to
;
that
's
all
I
want
.
Of
course
she
's
getting
a
bit
broad
in
the
*NL*
beam
.
But
Mme.
de
Cr√©cy
!
There
's
a
little
woman
who
knows
what
's
what
,
*NL*
all
right
.
Upon
my
word
and
soul
,
you
can
see
at
a
glance
she
's
got
*NL*
the
American
eye
,
that
girl
has
.
We
are
speaking
of
Mme.
de
Cr√©cy
,
''
he
*NL*
explained
,
as
M.
Verdurin
joined
them
,
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
.
``
I
should
*NL*
say
that
,
as
a
specimen
of
the
female
form
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
have
it
in
my
bed
than
a
clap
of
thunder
!
''
the
words
came
*NL*
tumbling
from
Cottard
,
who
had
for
some
time
been
waiting
in
vain
until
*NL*
Forcheville
should
pause
for
breath
,
so
that
he
might
get
in
his
hoary
*NL*
old
joke
,
a
chance
for
which
might
not
,
he
feared
,
come
again
,
if
the
*NL*
conversation
should
take
a
different
turn
;
and
he
produced
it
now
with
*NL*
that
excessive
spontaneity
and
confidence
which
may
often
be
noticed
*NL*
attempting
to
cover
up
the
coldness
,
and
the
slight
flutter
of
emotion
,
*NL*
inseparable
from
a
prepared
recitation
.
Forcheville
knew
and
saw
the
*NL*
joke
,
and
was
thoroughly
amused
.
As
for
M.
Verdurin
,
he
was
unsparing
*NL*
of
his
merriment
,
having
recently
discovered
a
way
of
expressing
it
by
*NL*
a
symbol
,
different
from
his
wife
's
,
but
equally
simple
and
obvious
.
*NL*
Scarcely
had
he
begun
the
movement
of
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
*NL*
who
was
`
shaking
with
laughter
'
than
he
would
begin
also
to
cough
,
as
*NL*
though
,
in
laughing
too
violently
,
he
had
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
smoke
*NL*
from
his
pipe
.
And
by
keeping
the
pipe
firmly
in
his
mouth
he
could
*NL*
prolong
indefinitely
the
dumb-show
of
suffocation
and
hilarity
.
So
he
*NL*
and
Mme.
Verdurin
-LRB-
who
,
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
where
the
painter
*NL*
was
telling
her
a
story
,
was
shutting
her
eyes
preparatory
to
flinging
*NL*
her
face
into
her
hands
-RRB-
resembled
two
masks
in
a
theatre
,
each
*NL*
representing
Comedy
,
but
in
a
different
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Verdurin
had
been
wiser
than
he
knew
in
not
taking
his
pipe
out
of
*NL*
his
mouth
,
for
Cottard
,
having
occasion
to
leave
the
room
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
murmured
a
witty
euphemism
which
he
had
recently
acquired
and
repeated
*NL*
now
whenever
he
had
to
go
to
the
place
in
question
:
``
I
must
just
go
and
*NL*
see
the
Duc
d'Aumale
for
a
minute
,
''
so
drolly
,
that
M.
Verdurin
's
cough
*NL*
began
all
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
take
your
pipe
out
of
your
mouth
;
ca
n't
you
see
,
you
'll
*NL*
choke
if
you
try
to
bottle
up
your
laughter
like
that
,
''
counselled
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
,
as
she
came
round
with
a
tray
of
liqueurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
delightful
man
your
husband
is
;
he
has
the
wit
of
a
dozen
!
''
*NL*
declared
Forcheville
to
Mme.
Cottard
.
``
Thank
you

thank
you

an
old
*NL*
soldier
like
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
M.

Forcheville

Odette
charming

M.
Verdurin
told
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
you
know
,
she
wants
so
much
to
meet
you
again
some
day
at
*NL*
luncheon

We
must
arrange
it
,
but
do
n't
on
any
account
let
Swann
hear
*NL*
about
it
.
He
spoils
everything

do
n't

know

I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
*NL*
you
're
not
to
come
to
dinner
too

of
course

we
hope
to
see
you
very
*NL*
often

Now
that
the
warm
weather
's
coming

we
're
going
to
have
dinner

out
of
doors
whenever
we
can

it

a
quiet

little
dinner

now

in

delightful

*NL*
``

going
to
do
any
work
this
evening

say

she
screamed
*NL*
suddenly
to
the
little
pianist
,
seeing
an
opportunity
for
displaying
,
*NL*
before
a
`
newcomer
'
of
Forcheville
's
importance
,
at
once
her
unfailing
*NL*
wit
and
her
despotic
power
over
the
`
faithful
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
de
Forcheville
was
just
going
to
say
something
dreadful
about
you

*NL*
Mme.
Cottard
warned
her
husband
as
he
reappeared
in
the
room
.
And
he
,
*NL*
still
following
up
the
idea
of
Forcheville
's
noble
birth
,
which
had
*NL*
obsessed
him
all
through
dinner
,
began
again
with
:
``
I
am
treating

there
some
Putbuses
in
the
*NL*
Crusades
?
Anyhow
they
've
got
a
lake
in
Pomerania
that
's
ten
times
the
*NL*
size
of
the
Place
de
la
Concorde
.
I
am
treating
her
for
dry
arthritis
;
*NL*
she
's
a
charming
woman
.
Mme.
Verdurin
knows
her
too
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
enabled
Forcheville
,
a
moment
later
,
finding
himself
alone
with
*NL*
Mme.
Cottard
,
to
complete
his
favourable
verdict
on
her
husband
with
:
*NL*
``
He
's
an
interesting
man
,
too
;
you
can
see
that
he
knows
some
good
*NL*
people
.
Gad
!
but
they
get
to
know
a
lot
of
things
,
those
doctors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'you
want
me
to
play
the
phrase
from
the
sonata
for
M.
Swann
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
pianist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
's
that
?
Not
the
sonata-snake
,
I
hope
!
''
shouted
M.
de
*NL*
Forcheville
,
hoping
to
create
an
effect
.
But
Dr.
Cottard
,
who
had
*NL*
never
heard
this
pun
,
missed
the
point
of
it
,
and
imagined
that
M.
de
*NL*
Forcheville
had
made
a
mistake
.
He
dashed
in
boldly
to
correct
it
:
``
No
,
*NL*
no
.
The
word
is
n't
_
serpent-√†-sonates
_
,
it
's
_
serpent-√†-sonnettes
_
!
''
he
*NL*
explained
in
a
tone
at
once
zealous
,
impatient
,
and
triumphant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Forcheville
explained
the
joke
to
him
.
The
Doctor
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
admit
it
's
not
bad
,
eh
,
Doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
've
known
it
for
ages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
were
silenced
;
heralded
by
the
waving
tremolo
of
the
*NL*
violin-part
,
which
formed
a
bristling
bodyguard
of
sound
two
octaves
*NL*
above
it
--
and
as
in
a
mountainous
country
,
against
the
seeming
*NL*
immobility
of
a
vertically
falling
torrent
,
one
may
distinguish
,
two
*NL*
hundred
feet
below
,
the
tiny
form
of
a
woman
walking
in
the
valley
--
the
*NL*
little
phrase
had
just
appeared
,
distant
but
graceful
,
protected
by
*NL*
the
long
,
gradual
unfurling
of
its
transparent
,
incessant
and
sonorous
*NL*
curtain
.
And
Swann
,
in
his
heart
of
hearts
,
turned
to
it
,
spoke
to
it
as
*NL*
to
a
confidant
in
the
secret
of
his
love
,
as
to
a
friend
of
Odette
who
*NL*
would
assure
him
that
he
need
pay
no
attention
to
this
Forcheville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
've
come
too
late
!
''
Mme.
Verdurin
greeted
one
of
the
`
faithful
,
'
*NL*
whose
invitation
had
been
only
`
to
look
in
after
dinner
,
'
``
we
've
been
*NL*
having
a
simply
incomparable
Brichot
!
You
never
heard
such
eloquence
!
*NL*
But
he
's
gone
.
Is
n't
that
so
,
M.
Swann
?
I
believe
it
's
the
first
time
*NL*
you
've
met
him
,
''
she
went
on
,
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
it
was
to
her
*NL*
that
Swann
owed
the
introduction
.
``
Is
n't
that
so
;
was
n't
he
delicious
,
*NL*
our
Brichot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
bowed
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
You
were
n't
interested
?
''
she
asked
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
assure
you
,
I
was
quite
enthralled
.
He
is
perhaps
a
little
*NL*
too
peremptory
,
a
little
too
jovial
for
my
taste
.
I
should
like
to
see
*NL*
him
a
little
less
confident
at
times
,
a
little
more
tolerant
,
but
one
*NL*
feels
that
he
knows
a
great
deal
,
and
on
the
whole
he
seems
a
very
sound
*NL*
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
broke
up
very
late
.
Cottard
's
first
words
to
his
wife
were
:
``
I
*NL*
have
rarely
seen
Mme.
Verdurin
in
such
form
as
she
was
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
exactly
is
your
Mme.
Verdurin
?
A
bit
of
a
bad
hat
,
eh
?
''
said
*NL*
Forcheville
to
the
painter
,
to
whom
he
had
offered
a
`
lift
.
'
Odette
*NL*
watched
his
departure
with
regret
;
she
dared
not
refuse
to
let
Swann
*NL*
take
her
home
,
but
she
was
moody
and
irritable
in
the
carriage
,
and
,
*NL*
when
he
asked
whether
he
might
come
in
,
replied
,
``
I
suppose
so
,
''
with
an
*NL*
impatient
shrug
of
her
shoulders
.
When
they
had
all
gone
,
Mme.
Verdurin
*NL*
said
to
her
husband
:
``
Did
you
notice
the
way
Swann
laughed
,
such
an
*NL*
idiotic
laugh
,
when
we
spoke
about
Mme.
La
Tr√©mo√Ølle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
remarked
,
more
than
once
,
how
Swann
and
Forcheville
suppressed
*NL*
the
particle
`
de
'
before
that
lady
's
name
.
Never
doubting
that
it
was
*NL*
done
on
purpose
,
to
shew
that
they
were
not
afraid
of
a
title
,
she
had
*NL*
made
up
her
mind
to
imitate
their
arrogance
,
but
had
not
quite
*NL*
grasped
what
grammatical
form
it
ought
to
take
.
Moreover
,
the
natural
*NL*
corruptness
of
her
speech
overcoming
her
implacable
republicanism
,
*NL*
she
still
said
instinctively
``
the
de
La
Tr√©mo√Ølles
,
''
or
,
rather
-LRB-
by
*NL*
an
abbreviation
sanctified
by
the
usage
of
music-hall
singers
and
the
*NL*
writers
of
the
`
captions
'
beneath
caricatures
,
who
elide
the
`
de
'
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
the
d'La
Tr√©mo√Ølles
,
''
but
she
corrected
herself
at
once
to
``
Madame
La
*NL*
Tr√©mo√Ølle
.
--
The
_
Duchess
_
,
as
Swann
calls
her
,
''
she
added
ironically
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
which
proved
that
she
was
merely
quoting
,
and
would
not
,
*NL*
herself
,
accept
the
least
responsibility
for
a
classification
so
puerile
*NL*
and
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
saying
that
I
thought
him
extremely
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Verdurin
took
it
up
.
``
He
's
not
sincere
.
He
's
a
crafty
customer
,
*NL*
always
hovering
between
one
side
and
the
other
.
He
's
always
trying
to
*NL*
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
.
What
a
difference
between
*NL*
him
and
Forcheville
.
There
,
at
least
,
you
have
a
man
who
tells
you
*NL*
straight
out
what
he
thinks
.
Either
you
agree
with
him
or
you
do
n't
.
*NL*
Not
like
the
other
fellow
,
who
's
never
definitely
fish
or
fowl
.
Did
you
*NL*
notice
,
by
the
way
,
that
Odette
seemed
all
out
for
Forcheville
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
blame
her
,
either
.
And
then
,
after
all
,
if
Swann
tries
to
come
*NL*
the
man
of
fashion
over
us
,
the
champion
of
distressed
Duchesses
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
the
other
man
has
got
a
title
;
he
's
always
Comte
de
Forcheville
!
''
*NL*
he
let
the
words
slip
delicately
from
his
lips
,
as
though
,
familiar
with
*NL*
every
page
of
the
history
of
that
dignity
,
he
were
making
a
scrupulously
*NL*
exact
estimate
of
its
value
,
in
relation
to
others
of
the
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
saying
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
went
on
,
``
that
he
saw
fit
to
utter
*NL*
some
most
venomous
,
and
quite
absurd
insinuations
against
Brichot
.
*NL*
Naturally
,
once
he
saw
that
Brichot
was
popular
in
this
house
,
it
was
a
*NL*
way
of
hitting
back
at
us
,
of
spoiling
our
party
.
I
know
his
sort
,
the
*NL*
dear
,
good
friend
of
the
family
,
who
pulls
you
all
to
pieces
on
the
*NL*
stairs
as
he
's
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
say
so
?
''
retorted
her
husband
.
``
He
's
simply
a
failure
;
a
poor
*NL*
little
wretch
who
goes
through
life
mad
with
jealousy
of
anything
that
's
*NL*
at
all
big
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
truth
been
known
,
there
was
not
one
of
the
`
faithful
'
who
was
*NL*
not
infinitely
more
malicious
than
Swann
;
but
the
others
would
all
take
*NL*
the
precaution
of
tempering
their
malice
with
obvious
pleasantries
,
with
*NL*
little
sparks
of
emotion
and
cordiality
;
while
the
least
indication
of
*NL*
reserve
on
Swann
's
part
,
undraped
in
any
such
conventional
formula
*NL*
as
``
Of
course
,
I
do
n't
want
to
say
anything
--
''
to
which
he
would
have
*NL*
scorned
to
descend
,
appeared
to
them
a
deliberate
act
of
treachery
.
*NL*
There
are
certain
original
and
distinguished
authors
in
whom
the
least
*NL*
`
freedom
of
speech
'
is
thought
revolting
because
they
have
not
begun
*NL*
by
flattering
the
public
taste
,
and
serving
up
to
it
the
commonplace
*NL*
expressions
to
which
it
is
used
;
it
was
by
the
same
process
that
Swann
*NL*
infuriated
M.
Verdurin
.
In
his
case
as
in
theirs
it
was
the
novelty
*NL*
of
his
language
which
led
his
audience
to
suspect
the
blackness
of
his
*NL*
designs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
was
still
unconscious
of
the
disgrace
that
threatened
him
at
the
*NL*
Verdurins
'
,
and
continued
to
regard
all
their
absurdities
in
the
most
*NL*
rosy
light
,
through
the
admiring
eyes
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
rule
he
made
no
appointments
with
Odette
except
for
the
evenings
;
*NL*
he
was
afraid
of
her
growing
tired
of
him
if
he
visited
her
during
the
*NL*
day
as
well
;
at
the
same
time
he
was
reluctant
to
forfeit
,
even
for
*NL*
an
hour
,
the
place
that
he
held
in
her
thoughts
,
and
so
was
constantly
*NL*
looking
out
for
an
opportunity
of
claiming
her
attention
,
in
any
way
*NL*
that
would
not
be
displeasing
to
her
.
If
,
in
a
florist
's
or
a
jeweller
's
*NL*
window
,
a
plant
or
an
ornament
caught
his
eye
,
he
would
at
once
think
*NL*
of
sending
them
to
Odette
,
imagining
that
the
pleasure
which
the
casual
*NL*
sight
of
them
had
given
him
would
instinctively
be
felt
,
also
,
by
her
,
*NL*
and
would
increase
her
affection
for
himself
;
and
he
would
order
them
to
*NL*
be
taken
at
once
to
the
Rue
La
p√©rouse
,
so
as
to
accelerate
the
moment
*NL*
in
which
,
as
she
received
an
offering
from
him
,
he
might
feel
himself
,
*NL*
in
a
sense
,
transported
into
her
presence
.
He
was
particularly
anxious
,
*NL*
always
,
that
she
should
receive
these
presents
before
she
went
out
*NL*
for
the
evening
,
so
that
her
sense
of
gratitude
towards
him
might
give
*NL*
additional
tenderness
to
her
welcome
when
he
arrived
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
*NL*
might
even
--
for
all
he
knew
--
if
the
shopkeeper
made
haste
,
bring
him
a
*NL*
letter
from
her
before
dinner
,
or
herself
,
in
person
,
upon
his
doorstep
,
*NL*
come
on
a
little
extraordinary
visit
of
thanks
.
As
in
an
earlier
phase
,
*NL*
when
he
had
experimented
with
the
reflex
action
of
anger
and
contempt
*NL*
upon
her
character
,
he
sought
now
by
that
of
gratification
to
elicit
*NL*
from
her
fresh
particles
of
her
intimate
feelings
,
which
she
had
never
*NL*
yet
revealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
she
was
embarrassed
by
lack
of
money
,
and
under
pressure
from
*NL*
a
creditor
would
come
to
him
for
assistance
.
He
enjoyed
this
,
as
he
*NL*
enjoyed
everything
which
could
impress
Odette
with
his
love
for
herself
,
*NL*
or
merely
with
his
influence
,
with
the
extent
of
the
use
that
she
might
*NL*
make
of
him
.
Probably
if
anyone
had
said
to
him
,
at
the
beginning
,
``
It
's
*NL*
your
position
that
attracts
her
,
''
or
at
this
stage
,
``
It
's
your
money
*NL*
that
she
's
really
in
love
with
,
''
he
would
not
have
believed
the
*NL*
suggestion
,
nor
would
he
have
been
greatly
distressed
by
the
thought
*NL*
that
people
supposed
her
to
be
attached
to
him
,
that
people
felt
them
,
*NL*
to
be
united
by
any
ties
so
binding
as
those
of
snobbishness
or
wealth
.
*NL*
But
even
if
he
had
accepted
the
possibility
,
it
might
not
have
caused
*NL*
him
any
suffering
to
discover
that
Odette
's
love
for
him
was
based
on
a
*NL*
foundation
more
lasting
than
mere
affection
,
or
any
attractive
qualities
*NL*
which
she
might
have
found
in
him
;
on
a
sound
,
commercial
interest
;
an
*NL*
interest
which
would
postpone
for
ever
the
fatal
day
on
which
she
might
*NL*
be
tempted
to
bring
their
relations
to
an
end
.
For
the
moment
,
while
*NL*
he
lavished
presents
upon
her
,
and
performed
all
manner
of
services
,
*NL*
he
could
rely
on
advantages
not
contained
in
his
person
,
or
in
his
*NL*
intellect
,
could
forego
the
endless
,
killing
effort
to
make
himself
*NL*
attractive
.
And
this
delight
in
being
a
lover
,
in
living
by
love
alone
,
*NL*
of
the
reality
of
which
he
was
inclined
to
be
doubtful
,
the
price
which
,
*NL*
in
the
long
run
,
he
must
pay
for
it
,
as
a
dilettante
in
immaterial
*NL*
sensations
,
enhanced
its
value
in
his
eyes
--
as
one
sees
people
who
are
*NL*
doubtful
whether
the
sight
of
the
sea
and
the
sound
of
its
waves
are
*NL*
really
enjoyable
,
become
convinced
that
they
are
,
as
also
of
the
rare
*NL*
quality
and
absolute
detachment
of
their
own
taste
,
when
they
have
*NL*
agreed
to
pay
several
pounds
a
day
for
a
room
in
an
hotel
,
from
which
*NL*
that
sight
and
that
sound
may
be
enjoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
reflections
of
this
order
had
brought
him
once
again
to
*NL*
the
memory
of
the
time
when
some
one
had
spoken
to
him
of
Odette
as
of
*NL*
a
`
kept
'
woman
,
and
when
,
once
again
,
he
had
amused
himself
with
*NL*
contrasting
that
strange
personification
,
the
`
kept
'
woman
--
an
*NL*
iridescent
mixture
of
unknown
and
demoniacal
qualities
,
embroidered
,
*NL*
as
in
some
fantasy
of
Gustave
Moreau
,
with
poison-dripping
flowers
,
*NL*
interwoven
with
precious
jewels
--
with
that
Odette
upon
whose
face
he
*NL*
had
watched
the
passage
of
the
same
expressions
of
pity
for
a
sufferer
,
*NL*
resentment
of
an
act
of
injustice
,
gratitude
for
an
act
of
kindness
,
*NL*
which
he
had
seen
,
in
earlier
days
,
on
his
own
mother
's
face
,
and
on
*NL*
the
faces
of
friends
;
that
Odette
,
whose
conversation
had
so
frequently
*NL*
turned
on
the
things
that
he
himself
knew
better
than
anyone
,
his
*NL*
collections
,
his
room
,
his
old
servant
,
his
banker
,
who
kept
all
his
*NL*
title-deeds
and
bonds
;
--
the
thought
of
the
banker
reminded
him
that
he
*NL*
must
call
on
him
shortly
,
to
draw
some
money
.
And
indeed
,
if
,
during
the
*NL*
current
month
,
he
were
to
come
less
liberally
to
the
aid
of
Odette
in
*NL*
her
financial
difficulties
than
in
the
month
before
,
when
he
had
given
*NL*
her
five
thousand
francs
,
if
he
refrained
from
offering
her
a
diamond
*NL*
necklace
for
which
she
longed
,
he
would
be
allowing
her
admiration
for
*NL*
his
generosity
to
decline
,
that
gratitude
which
had
made
him
so
happy
,
*NL*
and
would
even
be
running
the
risk
of
her
imagining
that
his
love
*NL*
for
her
-LRB-
as
she
saw
its
visible
manifestations
grow
fewer
-RRB-
had
itself
*NL*
diminished
.
And
then
,
suddenly
,
he
asked
himself
whether
that
was
not
*NL*
precisely
what
was
implied
by
`
keeping
'
a
woman
-LRB-
as
if
,
in
fact
,
that
*NL*
idea
of
`
keeping
'
could
be
derived
from
elements
not
at
all
mysterious
*NL*
nor
perverse
,
but
belonging
to
the
intimate
routine
of
his
daily
life
,
*NL*
such
as
that
thousand-franc
note
,
a
familiar
and
domestic
object
,
torn
*NL*
in
places
and
mended
with
gummed
paper
,
which
his
valet
,
after
paying
*NL*
the
household
accounts
and
the
rent
,
had
locked
up
in
a
drawer
in
*NL*
the
old
writing-desk
whence
he
had
extracted
it
to
send
it
,
with
four
*NL*
others
,
to
Odette
-RRB-
and
whether
it
was
not
possible
to
apply
to
Odette
,
*NL*
since
he
had
known
her
-LRB-
for
he
never
imagined
for
a
moment
that
she
*NL*
could
ever
have
taken
a
penny
from
anyone
else
,
before
-RRB-
,
that
title
,
*NL*
which
he
had
believed
so
wholly
inapplicable
to
her
,
of
`
kept
'
woman
.
He
*NL*
could
not
explore
the
idea
further
,
for
a
sudden
access
of
that
mental
*NL*
lethargy
which
was
,
with
him
,
congenital
,
intermittent
and
providential
,
*NL*
happened
,
at
that
moment
,
to
extinguish
every
particle
of
light
in
his
*NL*
brain
,
as
instantaneously
as
,
at
a
later
period
,
when
electric
lighting
*NL*
had
been
everywhere
installed
,
it
became
possible
,
merely
by
fingering
*NL*
a
switch
,
to
cut
off
all
the
supply
of
light
from
a
house
.
His
mind
*NL*
fumbled
,
for
a
moment
,
in
the
darkness
,
he
took
off
his
spectacles
,
*NL*
wiped
the
glasses
,
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
,
but
saw
no
light
*NL*
until
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
wholly
different
idea
,
the
*NL*
realisation
that
he
must
endeavour
,
in
the
coming
month
,
to
send
Odette
*NL*
six
or
seven
thousand-franc
notes
instead
of
five
,
simply
as
a
surprise
*NL*
for
her
and
to
give
her
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
when
he
did
not
stay
at
home
until
it
was
time
to
meet
*NL*
Odette
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
or
rather
at
one
of
the
open-air
restaurants
*NL*
which
they
liked
to
frequent
in
the
Bois
and
especially
at
Saint-Cloud
,
*NL*
he
would
go
to
dine
in
one
of
those
fashionable
houses
in
which
,
at
one
*NL*
time
,
he
had
been
a
constant
guest
.
He
did
not
wish
to
lose
touch
with
*NL*
people
who
,
for
all
that
he
knew
,
might
be
of
use
,
some
day
,
to
Odette
,
*NL*
and
thanks
to
whom
he
was
often
,
in
the
meantime
,
able
to
procure
for
*NL*
her
some
privilege
or
pleasure
.
Besides
,
he
had
been
used
for
so
long
to
*NL*
the
refinement
and
comfort
of
good
society
that
,
side
by
side
with
his
*NL*
contempt
,
there
had
grown
up
also
a
desperate
need
for
it
,
with
the
*NL*
result
that
,
when
he
had
reached
the
point
after
which
the
humblest
*NL*
lodgings
appeared
to
him
as
precisely
on
a
par
with
the
most
princely
*NL*
mansions
,
his
senses
were
so
thoroughly
accustomed
to
the
latter
that
he
*NL*
could
not
enter
the
former
without
a
feeling
of
acute
discomfort
.
He
*NL*
had
the
same
regard
--
to
a
degree
of
identity
which
they
would
never
have
*NL*
suspected
--
for
the
little
families
with
small
incomes
who
asked
him
to
*NL*
dances
in
their
flats
-LRB-
``
straight
upstairs
to
the
fifth
floor
,
and
the
*NL*
door
on
the
left
''
-RRB-
as
for
the
Princesse
de
Parme
,
who
gave
the
most
*NL*
splendid
parties
in
Paris
;
but
he
had
not
the
feeling
of
being
actually
*NL*
`
at
the
ball
'
when
he
found
himself
herded
with
the
fathers
of
families
*NL*
in
the
bedroom
of
the
lady
of
the
house
,
while
the
spectacle
of
*NL*
wash-hand-stands
covered
over
with
towels
,
and
of
beds
converted
into
*NL*
cloak-rooms
,
with
a
mass
of
hats
and
great-coats
sprawling
over
their
*NL*
counterpanes
,
gave
him
the
same
stifling
sensation
that
,
nowadays
,
*NL*
people
who
have
been
used
for
half
a
lifetime
to
electric
light
derive
*NL*
from
a
smoking
lamp
or
a
candle
that
needs
to
be
snuffed
.
If
he
were
*NL*
dining
out
,
he
would
order
his
carriage
for
half-past
seven
;
while
he
*NL*
changed
his
clothes
,
he
would
be
wondering
,
all
the
time
,
about
Odette
,
*NL*
and
in
this
way
was
never
alone
,
for
the
constant
thought
of
Odette
*NL*
gave
to
the
moments
in
which
he
was
separated
from
her
the
same
peculiar
*NL*
charm
as
to
those
in
which
she
was
at
his
side
.
He
would
get
into
his
*NL*
carriage
and
drive
off
,
but
he
knew
that
this
thought
had
jumped
in
*NL*
after
him
and
had
settled
down
upon
his
knee
,
like
a
pet
animal
which
*NL*
he
might
take
everywhere
,
and
would
keep
with
him
at
the
dinner-table
,
*NL*
unobserved
by
his
fellow-guests
.
He
would
stroke
and
fondle
it
,
warm
*NL*
himself
with
it
,
and
,
as
a
feeling
of
languor
swept
over
him
,
would
*NL*
give
way
to
a
slight
shuddering
movement
which
contracted
his
throat
*NL*
and
nostrils
--
a
new
experience
,
this
,
--
as
he
fastened
the
bunch
of
*NL*
columbines
in
his
buttonhole
.
He
had
for
some
time
been
feeling
neither
*NL*
well
nor
happy
,
especially
since
Odette
had
brought
Forcheville
to
the
*NL*
Verdurins
'
,
and
he
would
have
liked
to
go
away
for
a
while
to
rest
in
*NL*
the
country
.
But
he
could
never
summon
up
courage
to
leave
Paris
,
even
*NL*
for
a
day
,
while
Odette
was
there
.
The
weather
was
warm
;
it
was
the
*NL*
finest
part
of
the
spring
.
And
for
all
that
he
was
driving
through
a
*NL*
city
of
stone
to
immure
himself
in
a
house
without
grass
or
garden
,
what
*NL*
was
incessantly
before
his
eyes
was
a
park
which
he
owned
,
near
Combray
,
*NL*
where
,
at
four
in
the
afternoon
,
before
coming
to
the
asparagus-bed
,
*NL*
thanks
to
the
breeze
that
was
wafted
across
the
fields
from
M√©s√©glise
,
*NL*
he
could
enjoy
the
fragrant
coolness
of
the
air
as
well
beneath
an
*NL*
arbour
of
hornbeams
in
the
garden
as
by
the
bank
of
the
pond
,
fringed
*NL*
with
forget-me-not
and
iris
;
and
where
,
when
he
sat
down
to
dinner
,
*NL*
trained
and
twined
by
the
gardener
's
skilful
hand
,
there
ran
all
about
*NL*
his
table
currant-bush
and
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
if
he
had
an
early
appointment
in
the
Bois
or
at
*NL*
Saint-Cloud
,
he
would
rise
from
table
and
leave
the
house
so
*NL*
abruptly
--
especially
if
it
threatened
to
rain
,
and
so
to
scatter
the
*NL*
`
faithful
'
before
their
normal
time
--
that
on
one
occasion
the
Princesse
*NL*
des
Laumes
-LRB-
at
whose
house
dinner
had
been
so
late
that
Swann
had
left
*NL*
before
the
coffee
came
in
,
to
join
the
Verdurins
on
the
Island
in
the
*NL*
Bois
-RRB-
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
if
Swann
were
thirty
years
older
,
and
had
diabetes
,
there
might
*NL*
be
some
excuse
for
his
running
away
like
that
.
He
seems
to
look
upon
us
*NL*
all
as
a
joke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
persuaded
himself
that
the
spring-time
charm
,
which
he
could
not
go
*NL*
down
to
Combray
to
enjoy
,
he
would
find
at
least
on
the
He
des
Cygnes
*NL*
or
at
Saint-Cloud
.
But
as
he
could
think
only
of
Odette
,
he
would
*NL*
return
home
not
knowing
even
if
he
had
tasted
the
fragrance
of
the
young
*NL*
leaves
,
or
if
the
moon
had
been
shining
.
He
would
be
welcomed
by
the
*NL*
little
phrase
from
the
sonata
,
played
in
the
garden
on
the
restaurant
*NL*
piano
.
If
there
was
none
in
the
garden
,
the
Verdurins
would
have
taken
*NL*
immense
pains
to
have
a
piano
brought
out
either
from
a
private
room
*NL*
or
from
the
restaurant
itself
;
not
because
Swann
was
now
restored
to
*NL*
favour
;
far
from
it
.
But
the
idea
of
arranging
an
ingenious
form
of
*NL*
entertainment
for
some
one
,
even
for
some
one
whom
they
disliked
,
would
*NL*
stimulate
them
,
during
the
time
spent
in
its
preparation
,
to
a
momentary
*NL*
sense
of
cordiality
and
affection
.
Now
and
then
he
would
remind
himself
*NL*
that
another
fine
spring
evening
was
drawing
to
a
close
,
and
would
force
*NL*
himself
to
notice
the
trees
and
the
sky
.
But
the
state
of
excitement
*NL*
into
which
Odette
's
presence
never
failed
to
throw
him
,
added
to
a
*NL*
feverish
ailment
which
,
for
some
time
now
,
had
scarcely
left
him
,
*NL*
robbed
him
of
that
sense
of
quiet
and
comfort
which
is
an
indispensable
*NL*
background
to
the
impressions
that
we
derive
from
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
when
Swann
had
consented
to
dine
with
the
Verdurins
,
and
*NL*
had
mentioned
during
dinner
that
he
had
to
attend
,
next
day
,
the
annual
*NL*
banquet
of
an
old
comrades
'
association
,
Odette
had
at
once
exclaimed
*NL*
across
the
table
,
in
front
of
everyone
,
in
front
of
Forcheville
,
who
was
*NL*
now
one
of
the
`
faithful
,
'
in
front
of
the
painter
,
in
front
of
Cottard
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
you
have
your
banquet
to-morrow
;
I
sha
'n'
t
see
you
,
then
,
*NL*
till
I
get
home
;
do
n't
be
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
although
Swann
had
never
yet
taken
offence
,
at
all
seriously
,
*NL*
at
Odette
's
demonstrations
of
friendship
for
one
or
other
of
the
*NL*
`
faithful
,
'
he
felt
an
exquisite
pleasure
on
hearing
her
thus
avow
,
*NL*
before
them
all
,
with
that
calm
immodesty
,
the
fact
that
they
saw
each
*NL*
other
regularly
every
evening
,
his
privileged
position
in
her
house
,
and
*NL*
her
own
preference
for
him
which
it
implied
.
It
was
true
that
Swann
had
*NL*
often
reflected
that
Odette
was
in
no
way
a
remarkable
woman
;
and
in
*NL*
the
supremacy
which
he
wielded
over
a
creature
so
distinctly
inferior
to
*NL*
himself
there
was
nothing
that
especially
flattered
him
when
he
heard
*NL*
it
proclaimed
to
all
the
`
faithful
'
;
but
since
he
had
observed
that
,
*NL*
to
several
other
men
than
himself
,
Odette
seemed
a
fascinating
and
*NL*
desirable
woman
,
the
attraction
which
her
body
held
for
him
had
aroused
*NL*
a
painful
longing
to
secure
the
absolute
mastery
of
even
the
tiniest
*NL*
particles
of
her
heart
.
And
he
had
begun
to
attach
an
incalculable
value
*NL*
to
those
moments
passed
in
her
house
in
the
evenings
,
when
he
held
her
*NL*
upon
his
knee
,
made
her
tell
him
what
she
thought
about
this
or
that
,
*NL*
and
counted
over
that
treasure
to
which
,
alone
of
all
his
earthly
*NL*
possessions
,
he
still
clung
.
And
so
,
after
this
dinner
,
drawing
her
*NL*
aside
,
he
took
care
to
thank
her
effusively
,
seeking
to
indicate
to
*NL*
her
by
the
extent
of
his
gratitude
the
corresponding
intensity
of
*NL*
the
pleasures
which
it
was
in
her
power
to
bestow
on
him
,
the
supreme
*NL*
pleasure
being
to
guarantee
him
immunity
,
for
as
long
as
his
love
should
*NL*
last
and
he
remain
vulnerable
,
from
the
assaults
of
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
away
from
his
banquet
,
the
next
evening
,
it
was
pouring
*NL*
rain
,
and
he
had
nothing
but
his
victoria
.
A
friend
offered
to
take
*NL*
him
home
in
a
closed
carriage
,
and
as
Odette
,
by
the
fact
of
her
having
*NL*
invited
him
to
come
,
had
given
him
an
assurance
that
she
was
expecting
*NL*
no
one
else
,
he
could
,
with
a
quiet
mind
and
an
untroubled
heart
,
rather
*NL*
than
set
off
thus
in
the
rain
,
have
gone
home
and
to
bed
.
But
perhaps
,
*NL*
if
she
saw
that
he
seemed
not
to
adhere
to
his
resolution
to
end
every
*NL*
evening
,
without
exception
,
in
her
company
,
she
might
grow
careless
,
and
*NL*
fail
to
keep
free
for
him
just
the
one
evening
on
which
he
particularly
*NL*
desired
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
eleven
when
he
reached
her
door
,
and
as
he
made
his
apology
*NL*
for
having
been
unable
to
come
away
earlier
,
she
complained
that
it
was
*NL*
indeed
very
late
;
the
storm
had
made
her
unwell
,
her
head
ached
,
and
*NL*
she
warned
him
that
she
would
not
let
him
stay
longer
than
half
an
hour
,
*NL*
that
at
midnight
she
would
send
him
away
;
a
little
while
later
she
felt
*NL*
tired
and
wished
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
cattleya
,
then
,
to-night
?
''
he
asked
,
``
and
I
've
been
looking
forward
*NL*
so
to
a
nice
little
cattleya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
irresponsive
;
saying
nervously
:
``
No
,
dear

Ca
n't
you
see
,
I
'm
not
well
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
have
done
you
good
,
but
I
wo
n't

you

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
begged
him
to
put
out
the
light
before
he
went
;
he
drew
the
curtains
*NL*
close
round
her
bed
and
left
her
.
But
,
when
he
was
in
his
own
house
*NL*
again
,
the
idea
suddenly
struck
him
that
,
perhaps
,
Odette
was
expecting
*NL*
some
one
else
that
evening
,
that
she
had
merely
pretended
to
be
tired
,
*NL*
that
she
had
asked
him
to
put
the
light
out
only
so
that
he
should
*NL*
suppose
that
she
was
going
to
sleep
,
that
the
moment
he
had
left
*NL*
the
house
she
had
lighted
it
again
,
and
had
reopened
her
door
to
the
*NL*
stranger
who
was
to
be
her
guest
for
the
night
.
He
looked
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
It
was
about
an
hour
and
a
half
since
he
had
left
her
;
he
went
out
,
took
*NL*
a
cab
,
and
stopped
it
close
to
her
house
,
in
a
little
street
running
at
*NL*
right
angles
to
that
other
street
,
which
lay
at
the
back
of
her
house
,
*NL*
and
along
which
he
used
to
go
,
sometimes
,
to
tap
upon
her
bedroom
*NL*
window
,
for
her
to
let
him
in
.
He
left
his
cab
;
the
streets
were
all
*NL*
deserted
and
dark
;
he
walked
a
few
yards
and
came
out
almost
opposite
*NL*
her
house
.
Amid
the
glimmering
blackness
of
all
the
row
of
windows
,
the
*NL*
lights
in
which
had
long
since
been
put
out
,
he
saw
one
,
and
only
one
,
*NL*
from
which
overflowed
,
between
the
slats
of
its
shutters
,
dosed
like
a
*NL*
wine-press
over
its
mysterious
golden
juice
,
the
light
that
filled
the
*NL*
room
within
,
a
light
which
on
so
many
evenings
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
,
*NL*
far
off
,
as
he
turned
into
the
street
,
had
rejoiced
his
heart
with
its
*NL*
message
:
``
She
is
there
--
expecting
you
,
''
and
now
tortured
him
with
:
``
She
*NL*
is
there
with
the
man
she
was
expecting
.
''
He
must
know
who
;
he
tiptoed
*NL*
along
by
the
wall
until
he
reached
the
window
,
but
between
the
slanting
*NL*
bars
of
the
shutters
he
could
see
nothing
;
he
could
hear
,
only
,
in
the
*NL*
silence
of
the
night
,
the
murmur
of
conversation
.
What
agony
he
suffered
*NL*
as
he
watched
that
light
,
in
whose
golden
atmosphere
were
moving
,
behind
*NL*
the
closed
sash
,
the
unseen
and
detested
pair
,
as
he
listened
to
that
*NL*
murmur
which
revealed
the
presence
of
the
man
who
had
crept
in
after
his
*NL*
own
departure
,
the
perfidy
of
Odette
,
and
the
pleasures
which
she
was
at
*NL*
that
moment
tasting
with
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
was
not
sorry
that
he
had
come
;
the
torment
which
had
forced
*NL*
him
to
leave
his
own
house
had
lost
its
sharpness
when
it
lost
its
*NL*
uncertainty
,
now
that
Odette
's
other
life
,
of
which
he
had
had
,
at
that
*NL*
first
moment
,
a
sudden
helpless
suspicion
,
was
definitely
there
,
almost
*NL*
within
his
grasp
,
before
his
eyes
,
in
the
full
glare
of
the
lamp-light
,
*NL*
caught
and
kept
there
,
an
unwitting
prisoner
,
in
that
room
into
which
,
*NL*
when
he
would
,
he
might
force
his
way
to
surprise
and
seize
it
;
or
*NL*
rather
he
would
tap
upon
the
shutters
,
as
he
had
often
done
when
he
had
*NL*
come
there
very
late
,
and
by
that
signal
Odette
would
at
least
learn
*NL*
that
he
knew
,
that
he
had
seen
the
light
and
had
heard
the
voices
;
while
*NL*
he
himself
,
who
a
moment
ago
had
been
picturing
her
as
laughing
at
him
,
*NL*
as
sharing
with
that
other
the
knowledge
of
how
effectively
he
had
been
*NL*
tricked
,
now
it
was
he
that
saw
them
,
confident
and
persistent
in
*NL*
their
error
,
tricked
and
trapped
by
none
other
than
himself
,
whom
they
*NL*
believed
to
be
a
mile
away
,
but
who
was
there
,
in
person
,
there
with
a
*NL*
plan
,
there
with
the
knowledge
that
he
was
going
,
in
another
minute
,
to
*NL*
tap
upon
the
shutter
.
And
,
perhaps
,
what
he
felt
-LRB-
almost
an
agreeable
*NL*
feeling
-RRB-
at
that
moment
was
something
more
than
relief
at
the
solution
*NL*
of
a
doubt
,
at
the
soothing
of
a
pain
;
was
an
intellectual
pleasure
.
*NL*
If
,
since
he
had
fallen
in
love
,
things
had
recovered
a
little
of
the
*NL*
delicate
attraction
that
they
had
had
for
him
long
ago
--
though
only
when
*NL*
a
light
was
shed
upon
them
by
a
thought
,
a
memory
of
Odette
--
now
it
was
*NL*
another
of
the
faculties
,
prominent
in
the
studious
days
of
his
youth
,
*NL*
that
Odette
had
quickened
with
new
life
,
the
passion
for
truth
,
but
for
*NL*
a
truth
which
,
too
,
was
interposed
between
himself
and
his
mistress
,
*NL*
receiving
its
light
from
her
alone
,
a
private
and
personal
truth
the
*NL*
sole
object
of
which
-LRB-
an
infinitely
precious
object
,
and
one
almost
*NL*
impersonal
in
its
absolute
beauty
-RRB-
was
Odette
--
Odette
in
her
activities
,
*NL*
her
environment
,
her
projects
,
and
her
past
.
At
every
other
period
in
*NL*
his
life
,
the
little
everyday
words
and
actions
of
another
person
had
*NL*
always
seemed
wholly
valueless
to
Swann
;
if
gossip
about
such
things
*NL*
were
repeated
to
him
,
he
would
dismiss
it
as
insignificant
,
and
while
he
*NL*
listened
it
was
only
the
lowest
,
the
most
commonplace
part
of
his
*NL*
mind
that
was
interested
;
at
such
moments
he
felt
utterly
dull
and
*NL*
uninspired
.
But
in
this
strange
phase
of
love
the
personality
of
another
*NL*
person
becomes
so
enlarged
,
so
deepened
,
that
the
curiosity
which
*NL*
he
could
now
feel
aroused
in
himself
,
to
know
the
least
details
of
a
*NL*
woman
's
daily
occupation
,
was
the
same
thirst
for
knowledge
with
which
*NL*
he
had
once
studied
history
.
And
all
manner
of
actions
,
from
which
,
*NL*
until
now
,
he
would
have
recoiled
in
shame
,
such
as
spying
,
to-night
,
*NL*
outside
a
window
,
to-morrow
,
for
all
he
knew
,
putting
adroitly
*NL*
provocative
questions
to
casual
witnesses
,
bribing
servants
,
listening
*NL*
at
doors
,
seemed
to
him
,
now
,
to
be
precisely
on
a
level
with
the
*NL*
deciphering
of
manuscripts
,
the
weighing
of
evidence
,
the
interpretation
*NL*
of
old
monuments
,
that
was
to
say
,
so
many
different
methods
of
*NL*
scientific
investigation
,
each
one
having
a
definite
intellectual
value
*NL*
and
being
legitimately
employable
in
the
search
for
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
his
hand
stole
out
towards
the
shutters
he
felt
a
pang
of
shame
at
*NL*
the
thought
that
Odette
would
now
know
that
he
had
suspected
her
,
that
*NL*
he
had
returned
,
that
he
had
posted
himself
outside
her
window
.
She
*NL*
had
often
told
him
what
a
horror
she
had
of
jealous
men
,
of
lovers
who
*NL*
spied
.
What
he
was
going
to
do
would
be
extremely
awkward
,
and
she
would
*NL*
detest
him
for
ever
after
,
whereas
now
,
for
the
moment
,
for
so
long
as
*NL*
he
refrained
from
knocking
,
perhaps
even
in
the
act
of
infidelity
,
she
*NL*
loved
him
still
.
How
often
is
not
the
prospect
of
future
happiness
*NL*
thus
sacrificed
to
one
's
impatient
insistence
upon
an
immediate
*NL*
gratification
.
But
his
desire
to
know
the
truth
was
stronger
,
and
seemed
*NL*
to
him
nobler
than
his
desire
for
her
.
He
knew
that
the
true
story
*NL*
of
certain
events
,
which
he
would
have
given
his
life
to
be
able
to
*NL*
reconstruct
accurately
and
in
full
,
was
to
be
read
within
that
window
,
*NL*
streaked
with
bars
of
light
,
as
within
the
illuminated
,
golden
boards
of
*NL*
one
of
those
precious
manuscripts
,
by
whose
wealth
of
artistic
treasures
*NL*
the
scholar
who
consults
them
can
not
remain
unmoved
.
He
yearned
for
*NL*
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
the
truth
which
so
impassioned
him
in
that
*NL*
brief
,
fleeting
,
precious
transcript
,
on
that
translucent
page
,
so
warm
,
*NL*
so
beautiful
.
And
besides
,
the
advantage
which
he
felt
--
which
he
so
*NL*
desperately
wanted
to
feel
--
that
he
had
over
them
,
lay
perhaps
not
so
*NL*
much
in
knowing
as
in
being
able
to
shew
them
that
he
knew
.
He
drew
*NL*
himself
up
on
tiptoe
.
He
knocked
.
They
had
not
heard
;
he
knocked
again
;
*NL*
louder
;
their
conversation
ceased
.
A
man
's
voice
--
he
strained
his
ears
*NL*
to
distinguish
whose
,
among
such
of
Odette
's
friends
as
he
knew
,
the
*NL*
voice
could
be
--
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
be
certain
of
the
voice
.
He
knocked
once
again
.
The
window
*NL*
first
,
then
the
shutters
were
thrown
open
.
It
was
too
late
,
now
,
to
*NL*
retire
,
and
since
she
must
know
all
,
so
as
not
to
seem
too
contemptible
,
*NL*
too
jealous
and
inquisitive
,
he
called
out
in
a
careless
,
hearty
,
*NL*
welcoming
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
bother
;
I
just
happened
to
be
passing
,
and
saw
the
light
.
*NL*
I
wanted
to
know
if
you
were
feeling
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
.
Two
old
gentlemen
stood
facing
him
,
in
the
window
,
one
*NL*
of
them
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
;
and
beyond
them
he
could
see
into
*NL*
the
room
,
a
room
that
he
had
never
seen
before
.
Having
fallen
into
the
*NL*
habit
,
When
he
came
late
to
Odette
,
of
identifying
her
window
by
*NL*
the
fact
that
it
was
the
only
one
still
lighted
in
a
row
of
windows
*NL*
otherwise
all
alike
,
he
had
been
misled
,
this
time
,
by
the
light
,
and
*NL*
had
knocked
at
the
window
beyond
hers
,
in
the
adjoining
house
.
He
made
*NL*
what
apology
he
could
and
hurried
home
,
overjoyed
that
the
satisfaction
*NL*
of
his
curiosity
had
preserved
their
love
intact
,
and
that
,
having
*NL*
feigned
for
so
long
,
when
in
Odette
's
company
,
a
sort
of
indifference
,
*NL*
he
had
not
now
,
by
a
demonstration
of
jealousy
,
given
her
that
proof
*NL*
of
the
excess
of
his
own
passion
which
,
in
a
pair
of
lovers
,
fully
and
*NL*
finally
dispenses
the
recipient
from
the
obligation
to
love
the
other
*NL*
enough
.
He
never
spoke
to
her
of
this
misadventure
,
he
ceased
even
to
*NL*
think
of
it
himself
.
But
now
and
then
his
thoughts
in
their
wandering
*NL*
course
would
come
upon
this
memory
where
it
lay
unobserved
,
would
*NL*
startle
it
into
life
,
thrust
it
more
deeply
down
into
his
consciousness
,
*NL*
and
leave
him
aching
with
a
sharp
,
far-rooted
pain
.
As
though
this
had
*NL*
been
a
bodily
pain
,
Swann
's
mind
was
powerless
to
alleviate
it
;
in
the
*NL*
case
of
bodily
pain
,
however
,
since
it
is
independent
of
the
mind
,
the
*NL*
mind
can
dwell
upon
it
,
can
note
that
it
has
diminished
,
that
it
has
*NL*
momentarily
ceased
.
But
with
this
mental
pain
,
the
mind
,
merely
by
*NL*
recalling
it
,
created
it
afresh
.
To
determine
not
to
think
of
it
was
but
*NL*
to
think
of
it
still
,
to
suffer
from
it
still
.
And
when
,
in
conversation
*NL*
with
his
friends
,
he
forgot
his
sufferings
,
suddenly
a
word
casually
*NL*
uttered
would
make
him
change
countenance
as
a
wounded
man
does
when
a
*NL*
clumsy
hand
has
touched
his
aching
limb
.
When
he
came
away
from
Odette
,
*NL*
he
was
happy
,
he
felt
calm
,
he
recalled
the
smile
with
which
,
in
gentle
*NL*
mockery
,
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
this
man
or
of
that
,
a
smile
which
was
*NL*
all
tenderness
for
himself
;
he
recalled
the
gravity
of
her
head
which
*NL*
she
seemed
to
have
lifted
from
its
axis
to
let
it
droop
and
fall
,
as
*NL*
though
against
her
will
,
upon
his
lips
,
as
she
had
done
on
that
first
*NL*
evening
in
the
carriage
;
her
languishing
gaze
at
him
while
she
lay
*NL*
nestling
in
his
arms
,
her
bended
head
seeming
to
recede
between
her
*NL*
shoulders
,
as
though
shrinking
from
the
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
,
at
once
,
his
jealousy
,
as
it
had
been
the
shadow
of
his
love
,
*NL*
presented
him
with
the
complement
,
with
the
converse
of
that
new
smile
*NL*
with
which
she
had
greeted
him
that
very
evening
,
--
with
which
,
now
,
*NL*
perversely
,
she
was
mocking
Swann
while
she
tendered
her
love
to
*NL*
another
--
of
that
lowering
of
her
head
,
but
lowered
now
to
fall
on
other
*NL*
lips
,
and
-LRB-
but
bestowed
upon
a
stranger
-RRB-
of
all
the
marks
of
affection
*NL*
that
she
had
shewn
to
him
.
And
all
these
voluptuous
memories
which
he
*NL*
bore
away
from
her
house
were
,
as
one
might
say
,
but
so
many
sketches
,
*NL*
rough
plans
,
like
the
schemes
of
decoration
which
a
designer
submits
to
*NL*
one
in
outline
,
enabling
Swann
to
form
an
idea
of
the
various
attitudes
,
*NL*
aflame
or
faint
with
passion
,
which
she
was
capable
of
adopting
for
*NL*
others
.
With
the
result
that
he
came
to
regret
every
pleasure
that
he
*NL*
tasted
in
her
company
,
every
new
caress
that
he
invented
-LRB-
and
had
been
*NL*
so
imprudent
as
to
point
out
to
her
how
delightful
it
was
-RRB-
,
every
fresh
*NL*
charm
that
he
found
in
her
,
for
he
knew
that
,
a
moment
later
,
they
*NL*
would
go
to
enrich
the
collection
of
instruments
in
his
secret
*NL*
torture-chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fresh
turn
was
given
to
the
screw
when
Swann
recalled
a
sudden
*NL*
expression
which
he
had
intercepted
,
a
few
days
earlier
,
and
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
in
Odette
's
eyes
.
It
was
after
dinner
at
the
Verdurins
'
.
*NL*
Whether
it
was
because
Forcheville
,
aware
that
Saniette
,
his
*NL*
brother-in-law
,
was
not
in
favour
with
them
,
had
decided
to
make
a
butt
*NL*
of
him
,
and
to
shine
at
his
expense
,
or
because
he
had
been
annoyed
*NL*
by
some
awkward
remark
which
Saniette
had
made
to
him
,
although
it
had
*NL*
passed
unnoticed
by
the
rest
of
the
party
who
knew
nothing
of
whatever
*NL*
tactless
allusion
it
might
conceal
,
or
possibly
because
he
had
been
for
*NL*
some
time
looking
out
for
an
opportunity
of
securing
the
expulsion
from
*NL*
the
house
of
a
fellow-guest
who
knew
rather
too
much
about
him
,
and
*NL*
whom
he
knew
to
be
so
nice-minded
that
he
himself
could
not
help
feeling
*NL*
embarrassed
at
times
merely
by
his
presence
in
the
room
,
Forcheville
*NL*
replied
to
Saniette
's
tactless
utterance
with
such
a
volley
of
abuse
,
*NL*
going
out
of
his
way
to
insult
him
,
emboldened
,
the
louder
he
shouted
,
*NL*
by
the
fear
,
the
pain
,
the
entreaties
of
his
victim
,
that
the
poor
*NL*
creature
,
after
asking
Mme.
Verdurin
whether
he
should
stay
and
*NL*
receiving
no
answer
,
had
left
the
house
in
stammering
confusion
and
with
*NL*
tears
in
his
eyes
.
Odette
had
looked
on
,
impassive
,
at
this
scene
;
but
*NL*
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
Saniette
,
she
had
forced
the
normal
*NL*
expression
of
her
face
down
,
as
the
saying
is
,
by
several
pegs
,
so
as
to
*NL*
bring
herself
on
to
the
same
level
of
vulgarity
as
Forcheville
;
her
eyes
*NL*
had
sparkled
with
a
malicious
smile
of
congratulation
upon
his
audacity
,
*NL*
of
ironical
pity
for
the
poor
wretch
who
had
been
its
victim
;
she
*NL*
had
darted
at
him
a
look
of
complicity
in
the
crime
,
which
so
clearly
*NL*
implied
:
``
That
's
finished
him
off
,
or
I
'm
very
much
mistaken
.
Did
you
*NL*
see
what
a
fool
he
looked
?
He
was
actually
crying
,
''
that
Forcheville
,
*NL*
when
his
eyes
met
hers
,
sobered
in
a
moment
from
the
anger
,
or
pretended
*NL*
anger
with
which
he
was
still
flushed
,
smiled
as
he
explained
:
``
He
need
*NL*
only
have
made
himself
pleasant
and
he
'd
have
been
here
still
;
a
good
*NL*
scolding
does
a
man
no
harm
,
at
any
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
Swann
had
gone
out
early
in
the
afternoon
to
pay
a
call
,
*NL*
and
had
failed
to
find
the
person
at
home
whom
he
wished
to
see
,
it
*NL*
occurred
to
him
to
go
,
instead
,
to
Odette
,
at
an
hour
when
,
although
he
*NL*
never
went
to
her
house
then
as
a
rule
,
he
knew
that
she
was
always
at
*NL*
home
,
resting
or
writing
letters
until
tea-time
,
and
would
enjoy
seeing
*NL*
her
for
a
moment
,
if
it
did
not
disturb
her
.
The
porter
told
him
that
he
*NL*
believed
Odette
to
be
in
;
Swann
rang
the
bell
,
thought
that
he
heard
a
*NL*
sound
,
that
he
heard
footsteps
,
but
no
one
came
to
the
door
.
Anxious
and
*NL*
annoyed
,
he
went
round
to
the
other
little
street
,
at
the
back
of
her
*NL*
house
,
and
stood
beneath
her
bedroom
window
;
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
*NL*
he
could
see
nothing
;
he
knocked
loudly
upon
the
pane
,
he
shouted
;
still
*NL*
no
one
came
.
He
could
see
that
the
neighbours
were
staring
at
him
.
He
*NL*
turned
away
,
thinking
that
,
after
all
,
he
had
perhaps
been
mistaken
in
*NL*
believing
that
he
heard
footsteps
;
but
he
remained
so
preoccupied
with
*NL*
the
suspicion
that
he
could
turn
his
mind
to
nothing
else
.
After
waiting
*NL*
for
an
hour
,
he
returned
.
He
found
her
at
home
;
she
told
him
that
she
*NL*
had
been
in
the
house
when
he
rang
,
but
had
been
asleep
;
the
bell
had
*NL*
awakened
her
;
she
had
guessed
that
it
must
be
Swann
,
and
had
run
out
*NL*
to
meet
him
,
but
he
had
already
gone
.
She
had
,
of
course
,
heard
him
*NL*
knocking
at
the
window
.
Swann
could
at
once
detect
in
this
story
one
of
*NL*
those
fragments
of
literal
truth
which
liars
,
when
taken
by
surprise
,
*NL*
console
themselves
by
introducing
into
the
composition
of
the
falsehood
*NL*
which
they
have
to
invent
,
thinking
that
it
can
be
safely
incorporated
,
*NL*
and
will
lend
the
whole
story
an
air
of
verisimilitude
.
It
was
true
*NL*
that
,
when
Odette
had
just
done
something
which
she
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
disclose
,
she
would
take
pains
to
conceal
it
in
a
secret
place
in
her
*NL*
heart
.
But
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
man
to
*NL*
whom
she
was
obliged
to
lie
,
she
became
uneasy
,
all
her
ideas
melted
*NL*
like
wax
before
a
flame
,
her
inventive
and
her
reasoning
faculties
*NL*
were
paralysed
,
she
might
ransack
her
brain
but
would
find
only
a
void
;
*NL*
still
,
she
must
say
something
,
and
there
lay
within
her
reach
precisely
*NL*
the
fact
which
she
had
wished
to
conceal
,
which
,
being
the
truth
,
was
*NL*
the
one
thing
that
had
remained
.
She
broke
off
from
it
a
tiny
fragment
,
*NL*
of
no
importance
in
itself
,
assuring
herself
that
,
after
all
,
it
was
*NL*
the
best
thing
to
do
,
since
it
was
a
detail
of
the
truth
,
and
less
*NL*
dangerous
,
therefore
,
than
a
falsehood
.
``
At
any
rate
,
this
is
true
,
''
*NL*
she
said
to
herself
;
``
that
's
always
something
to
the
good
;
he
may
make
*NL*
inquiries
;
he
will
see
that
this
is
true
;
it
wo
n't
be
this
,
anyhow
,
that
*NL*
will
give
me
away
.
''
But
she
was
wrong
;
it
was
what
gave
her
away
;
she
*NL*
had
not
taken
into
account
that
this
fragmentary
detail
of
the
truth
*NL*
had
sharp
edges
which
could
not
:
be
made
to
fit
in
,
except
to
those
*NL*
contiguous
fragments
of
the
truth
from
which
she
had
arbitrarily
*NL*
detached
it
,
edges
which
,
whatever
the
fictitious
details
in
which
she
*NL*
might
embed
it
,
would
continue
to
shew
,
by
their
overlapping
angles
and
*NL*
by
the
gaps
which
she
had
forgotten
to
fill
,
that
its
proper
place
was
*NL*
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
admits
that
she
heard
me
ring
,
and
then
knock
,
that
she
knew
it
was
*NL*
myself
,
that
she
wanted
to
see
me
,
''
Swann
thought
to
himself
.
``
But
that
*NL*
does
n't
correspond
with
the
fact
that
she
did
not
let
me
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
,
however
,
draw
her
attention
to
this
inconsistency
,
for
he
*NL*
thought
that
,
if
left
to
herself
,
Odette
might
perhaps
produce
some
*NL*
falsehood
which
would
give
him
a
faint
indication
of
the
truth
;
she
*NL*
spoke
;
he
did
not
interrupt
her
,
he
gathered
up
,
with
an
eager
and
*NL*
sorrowful
piety
,
the
words
that
fell
from
her
lips
,
feeling
-LRB-
and
rightly
*NL*
feeling
,
since
she
was
hiding
the
truth
behind
them
as
she
spoke
-RRB-
that
,
*NL*
like
the
veil
of
a
sanctuary
,
they
kept
a
vague
imprint
,
traced
a
*NL*
faint
outline
of
that
infinitely
precious
and
,
alas
,
undiscoverable
*NL*
truth
;
--
what
she
had
been
doing
,
that
afternoon
,
at
three
o'clock
,
when
*NL*
he
had
called
,
--
a
truth
of
which
he
would
never
possess
any
more
than
*NL*
these
falsifications
,
illegible
and
divine
traces
,
a
truth
which
would
*NL*
exist
henceforward
only
in
the
secretive
memory
of
this
creature
,
who
*NL*
would
contemplate
it
in
utter
ignorance
of
its
value
,
but
would
never
*NL*
yield
it
up
to
him
.
It
was
true
that
he
had
,
now
and
then
,
a
strong
*NL*
suspicion
that
Odette
's
daily
activities
were
not
in
themselves
*NL*
passionately
interesting
,
and
that
such
relations
as
she
might
have
with
*NL*
other
men
did
not
exhale
,
naturally
,
in
a
universal
sense
,
or
for
every
*NL*
rational
being
,
a
spirit
of
morbid
gloom
capable
of
infecting
with
*NL*
fever
or
of
inciting
to
suicide
.
He
realised
,
at
such
moments
,
that
that
*NL*
interest
,
that
gloom
,
existed
in
him
only
as
a
malady
might
exist
,
and
*NL*
that
,
once
he
was
cured
of
the
malady
,
the
actions
of
Odette
,
the
kisses
*NL*
that
she
might
have
bestowed
,
would
become
once
again
as
innocuous
as
*NL*
those
of
countless
other
women
.
But
the
consciousness
that
the
painful
*NL*
curiosity
with
which
Swann
now
studied
them
had
its
origin
only
in
*NL*
himself
was
not
enough
to
make
him
decide
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
*NL*
regard
that
curiosity
as
important
,
and
to
take
every
possible
step
*NL*
to
satisfy
it
.
Swann
had
,
in
fact
,
reached
an
age
the
philosophy
of
*NL*
which
--
supported
,
in
his
case
,
by
the
current
philosophy
of
the
day
,
as
*NL*
well
as
by
that
of
the
circle
in
which
he
had
spent
most
of
his
life
,
*NL*
the
group
that
surrounded
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
in
which
one
's
*NL*
intelligence
was
understood
to
increase
with
the
strength
of
one
's
*NL*
disbelief
in
everything
,
and
nothing
real
and
incontestable
was
to
be
*NL*
discovered
,
except
the
individual
tastes
of
each
of
its
members
--
is
no
*NL*
longer
that
of
youth
,
but
a
positive
,
almost
a
medical
philosophy
,
the
*NL*
philosophy
of
men
who
,
instead
of
fixing
their
aspirations
upon
external
*NL*
objects
,
endeavour
to
separate
from
the
accumulation
of
the
years
*NL*
already
spent
a
definite
residue
of
habits
and
passions
which
they
*NL*
can
regard
as
characteristic
and
permanent
,
and
with
which
they
will
*NL*
deliberately
arrange
,
before
anything
else
,
that
the
kind
of
existence
*NL*
which
they
choose
to
adopt
shall
not
prove
inharmonious
.
Swann
deemed
*NL*
it
wise
to
make
allowance
in
his
life
for
the
suffering
which
he
derived
*NL*
from
not
knowing
what
Odette
had
done
,
just
as
he
made
allowance
for
the
*NL*
impetus
which
a
damp
climate
always
gave
to
his
eczema
;
to
anticipate
*NL*
in
his
budget
the
expenditure
of
a
considerable
sum
on
procuring
,
with
*NL*
regard
to
the
daily
occupations
of
Odette
,
information
the
lack
of
*NL*
which
would
make
him
unhappy
,
just
as
he
reserved
a
margin
for
the
*NL*
gratification
of
other
tastes
from
which
he
knew
that
pleasure
was
to
be
*NL*
expected
-LRB-
at
least
,
before
he
had
fallen
in
love
-RRB-
such
as
his
taste
for
*NL*
collecting
things
,
or
for
good
cooking
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
proposed
to
take
leave
of
Odette
,
and
to
return
home
,
she
begged
*NL*
him
to
stay
a
little
longer
,
and
even
detained
him
forcibly
,
seizing
him
*NL*
by
the
arm
as
he
was
opening
the
door
to
go
.
But
he
gave
no
thought
to
*NL*
that
,
for
,
among
the
crowd
of
gestures
and
speeches
and
other
little
*NL*
incidents
which
go
to
make
up
a
conversation
,
it
is
inevitable
that
we
*NL*
should
pass
-LRB-
without
noticing
anything
that
arouses
our
interest
-RRB-
by
*NL*
those
that
hide
a
truth
for
which
our
suspicions
are
blindly
searching
,
*NL*
whereas
we
stop
to
examine
others
beneath
which
nothing
lies
concealed
.
*NL*
She
kept
on
saying
:
``
What
a
dreadful
pity
;
you
never
by
any
chance
come
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
,
and
the
one
time
you
do
come
then
I
miss
you
.
''
He
knew
*NL*
very
well
that
she
was
not
sufficiently
in
love
with
him
to
be
so
*NL*
keenly
distressed
merely
at
having
missed
his
visit
,
but
as
she
was
a
*NL*
good-natured
woman
,
anxious
to
give
him
pleasure
,
and
often
sorry
when
*NL*
she
had
done
anything
that
annoyed
him
,
he
found
it
quite
natural
that
*NL*
she
should
be
sorry
,
on
this
occasion
,
that
she
had
deprived
him
of
that
*NL*
pleasure
of
spending
an
hour
in
her
company
,
which
was
so
very
great
a
*NL*
pleasure
,
if
not
to
herself
,
at
any
rate
to
him
.
All
the
same
,
it
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
so
little
importance
that
her
air
of
unrelieved
sorrow
began
*NL*
at
length
to
bewilder
him
.
She
reminded
him
,
even
more
than
was
*NL*
usual
,
of
the
faces
of
some
of
the
women
created
by
the
painter
of
*NL*
the
Primavera
.
'
She
had
,
at
that
moment
,
their
downcast
,
heartbroken
*NL*
expression
,
which
seems
ready
to
succumb
beneath
the
burden
of
a
grief
*NL*
too
heavy
to
be
borne
,
when
they
are
merely
allowing
the
Infant
Jesus
to
*NL*
play
with
a
pomegranate
,
or
watching
Moses
pour
water
into
a
trough
.
He
*NL*
had
seen
the
same
sorrow
once
before
on
her
face
,
but
when
,
he
could
*NL*
no
longer
say
.
Then
,
suddenly
,
he
remembered
it
;
it
was
when
Odette
had
*NL*
lied
,
in
apologising
to
Mme.
Verdurin
on
the
evening
after
the
dinner
*NL*
from
which
she
had
stayed
away
on
a
pretext
of
illness
,
but
really
so
*NL*
that
she
might
be
alone
with
Swann
.
Surely
,
even
had
she
been
the
most
*NL*
scrupulous
of
women
,
she
could
hardly
have
felt
remorse
for
so
innocent
*NL*
a
lie
.
But
the
lies
which
Odette
ordinarily
told
were
less
innocent
,
and
*NL*
served
to
prevent
discoveries
which
might
have
involved
her
in
the
most
*NL*
terrible
difficulties
with
one
or
another
of
her
friends
.
And
so
,
when
*NL*
she
lied
,
smitten
with
fear
,
feeling
herself
to
be
but
feebly
armed
for
*NL*
her
defence
,
unconfident
of
success
,
she
was
inclined
to
weep
from
sheer
*NL*
exhaustion
,
as
children
weep
sometimes
when
they
have
not
slept
.
She
*NL*
knew
,
also
,
that
her
lie
,
as
a
rule
,
was
doing
a
serious
injury
to
the
*NL*
man
to
whom
she
was
telling
it
,
and
that
she
might
find
herself
at
*NL*
his
mercy
if
she
told
it
badly
.
Therefore
she
felt
at
once
humble
and
*NL*
culpable
in
his
presence
.
And
when
she
had
to
tell
an
insignificant
,
*NL*
social
lie
its
hazardous
associations
,
and
the
memories
which
it
*NL*
recalled
,
would
leave
her
weak
with
a
sense
of
exhaustion
and
penitent
*NL*
with
a
consciousness
of
wrongdoing
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
depressing
lie
was
she
now
concocting
for
Swann
's
benefit
,
to
give
*NL*
her
that
pained
expression
,
that
plaintive
voice
,
which
seemed
to
falter
*NL*
beneath
the
effort
that
she
was
forcing
herself
to
make
,
and
to
plead
*NL*
for
pardon
?
He
had
an
idea
that
it
was
not
merely
the
truth
about
what
*NL*
had
occurred
that
afternoon
that
she
was
endeavouring
to
hide
from
him
,
*NL*
but
something
more
immediate
,
something
,
possibly
,
which
had
not
yet
*NL*
happened
,
but
might
happen
now
at
any
time
,
and
,
when
it
did
,
would
*NL*
throw
a
light
upon
that
earlier
event
.
At
that
moment
,
he
heard
the
*NL*
front-door
bell
ring
.
Odette
never
stopped
speaking
,
but
her
words
*NL*
dwindled
into
an
inarticulate
moan
.
Her
regret
at
not
having
seen
Swann
*NL*
that
afternoon
,
at
not
having
opened
the
door
to
him
,
had
melted
into
a
*NL*
universal
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hear
the
gate
being
closed
,
and
the
sound
of
a
carriage
,
as
*NL*
though
some
one
were
going
away
--
probably
the
person
whom
Swann
must
on
*NL*
no
account
meet
--
after
being
told
that
Odette
was
not
at
home
.
And
then
,
*NL*
when
he
reflected
that
,
merely
by
coming
at
an
hour
when
he
was
not
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
coming
,
he
had
managed
to
disturb
so
many
arrangements
of
*NL*
which
she
did
not
wish
him
to
know
,
he
had
a
feeling
of
discouragement
*NL*
that
amounted
,
almost
,
to
distress
.
But
since
he
was
in
love
with
*NL*
Odette
,
since
he
was
in
the
habit
of
turning
all
his
thoughts
towards
*NL*
her
,
the
pity
with
which
he
might
have
been
inspired
for
himself
he
felt
*NL*
for
her
only
,
and
murmured
:
``
Poor
darling
!
''
When
finally
he
left
her
,
*NL*
she
took
up
several
letters
which
were
lying
on
the
table
,
and
asked
him
*NL*
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
post
them
for
her
.
He
walked
along
to
the
*NL*
post-office
,
took
the
letters
from
his
pocket
,
and
,
before
dropping
each
*NL*
of
them
into
the
box
,
scanned
its
address
.
They
were
all
to
tradesmen
,
*NL*
except
the
last
,
which
was
to
Forcheville
.
He
kept
it
in
his
hand
.
``
If
*NL*
I
saw
what
was
in
this
,
''
he
argued
,
``
I
should
know
what
she
calls
him
,
*NL*
what
she
says
to
him
,
whether
there
really
is
anything
between
them
.
*NL*
Perhaps
,
if
I
do
n't
look
inside
,
I
shall
be
lacking
in
delicacy
towards
*NL*
Odette
,
since
in
this
way
alone
I
can
rid
myself
of
a
suspicion
which
*NL*
is
,
perhaps
,
a
calumny
on
her
,
which
must
,
in
any
case
,
cause
her
*NL*
suffering
,
and
which
can
never
possibly
be
set
at
rest
,
once
the
letter
*NL*
is
posted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
post-office
and
went
home
,
but
he
had
kept
the
last
letter
*NL*
in
his
pocket
.
He
lighted
a
candle
,
and
held
up
close
to
its
flame
the
*NL*
envelope
which
he
had
not
dared
to
open
.
At
first
he
could
distinguish
*NL*
nothing
,
but
the
envelope
was
thin
,
and
by
pressing
it
down
on
to
the
*NL*
stiff
card
which
it
enclosed
he
was
able
,
through
the
transparent
paper
,
*NL*
to
read
the
concluding
words
.
They
were
a
coldly
formal
signature
.
If
,
*NL*
instead
of
its
being
himself
who
was
looking
at
a
letter
addressed
to
*NL*
Forcheville
,
it
had
been
Forcheville
who
had
read
a
letter
addressed
*NL*
to
Swann
,
he
might
have
found
words
in
it
of
another
,
a
far
more
tender
*NL*
kind
!
He
took
a
firm
hold
of
the
card
,
which
was
sliding
to
and
fro
,
the
*NL*
envelope
being
too
large
for
it
and
then
,
by
moving
it
with
his
finger
*NL*
and
thumb
,
brought
one
line
after
another
beneath
the
part
of
the
*NL*
envelope
where
the
paper
was
not
doubled
,
through
which
alone
it
was
*NL*
possible
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
these
manoeuvres
he
could
not
make
it
out
clearly
.
Not
*NL*
that
it
mattered
,
for
he
had
seen
enough
to
assure
himself
that
the
*NL*
letter
was
about
some
trifling
incident
of
no
importance
,
and
had
*NL*
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
love
;
it
was
something
to
do
with
Odette
's
*NL*
uncle
.
Swann
had
read
quite
plainly
at
the
beginning
of
the
line
``
I
*NL*
was
right
,
''
but
did
not
understand
what
Odette
had
been
right
in
doing
,
*NL*
until
suddenly
a
word
which
he
had
not
been
able
,
at
first
,
to
decipher
,
*NL*
came
to
light
and
made
the
whole
sentence
intelligible
:
``
I
was
right
to
*NL*
open
the
door
;
it
was
my
uncle
.
''
To
open
the
door
!
Then
Forcheville
had
*NL*
been
there
when
Swann
rang
the
bell
,
and
she
had
sent
him
away
;
hence
*NL*
the
sound
that
Swann
had
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
he
read
the
whole
letter
;
at
the
end
she
apologised
for
*NL*
having
treated
Forcheville
with
so
little
ceremony
,
and
reminded
him
*NL*
that
he
had
left
his
cigarette-case
at
her
house
,
precisely
what
she
*NL*
had
written
to
Swann
after
one
of
his
first
visits
.
But
to
Swann
she
had
*NL*
added
:
``
Why
did
you
not
forget
your
heart
also
?
I
should
never
have
let
*NL*
you
have
that
back
.
''
To
Forcheville
nothing
of
that
sort
;
no
allusion
*NL*
that
could
suggest
any
intrigue
between
them
.
And
,
really
,
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
admit
that
in
all
this
business
Forcheville
had
been
worse
*NL*
treated
than
himself
,
since
Odette
was
writing
to
him
to
make
him
*NL*
believe
that
her
visitor
had
been
an
uncle
.
From
which
it
followed
that
*NL*
he
,
Swann
,
was
the
man
to
whom
she
attached
importance
,
and
for
whose
*NL*
sake
she
had
sent
the
other
away
.
And
yet
,
if
there
had
been
nothing
*NL*
between
Odette
and
Forcheville
,
why
not
have
opened
the
door
at
once
,
*NL*
why
have
said
,
``
I
was
right
to
open
the
door
;
it
was
my
uncle
.
''
Right
?
*NL*
if
she
was
doing
nothing
wrong
at
that
moment
how
could
Forcheville
*NL*
possibly
have
accounted
for
her
not
opening
the
door
?
For
a
time
Swann
*NL*
stood
still
there
,
heartbroken
,
bewildered
,
and
yet
happy
;
gazing
at
*NL*
this
envelope
which
Odette
had
handed
to
him
without
a
scruple
,
so
*NL*
absolute
was
her
trust
in
his
honour
;
through
its
transparent
window
*NL*
there
had
been
disclosed
to
him
,
with
the
secret
history
of
an
incident
*NL*
which
he
had
despaired
of
ever
being
able
to
learn
,
a
fragment
of
the
*NL*
life
of
Odette
,
seen
as
through
a
narrow
,
luminous
incision
,
cut
into
*NL*
its
surface
without
her
knowledge
.
Then
his
jealousy
rejoiced
at
the
*NL*
discovery
,
as
though
that
jealousy
had
had
an
independent
existence
,
*NL*
fiercely
egotistical
,
gluttonous
of
every
thing
that
would
feed
its
*NL*
vitality
,
even
at
the
expense
of
Swann
himself
.
Now
it
had
food
in
*NL*
store
,
and
Swann
could
begin
to
grow
uneasy
afresh
every
evening
,
over
*NL*
the
visits
that
Odette
had
received
about
five
o'clock
,
and
could
*NL*
seek
to
discover
where
Forcheville
had
been
at
that
hour
.
For
Swann
's
*NL*
affection
for
Odette
still
preserved
the
form
which
had
been
imposed
on
*NL*
it
,
from
the
beginning
,
by
his
ignorance
of
the
occupations
in
which
she
*NL*
passed
her
days
,
as
well
as
by
the
mental
lethargy
which
prevented
him
*NL*
from
supplementing
that
ignorance
by
imagination
.
He
was
not
jealous
,
at
*NL*
first
,
of
the
whole
of
Odette
's
life
,
but
of
those
moments
only
in
which
*NL*
an
incident
,
which
he
had
perhaps
misinterpreted
,
had
led
him
to
suppose
*NL*
that
Odette
might
have
played
him
false
.
His
jealousy
,
like
an
octopus
*NL*
which
throws
out
a
first
,
then
a
second
,
and
finally
a
third
tentacle
,
*NL*
fastened
itself
irremovably
first
to
that
moment
,
five
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
,
then
to
another
,
then
to
another
again
.
But
Swann
was
*NL*
incapable
of
inventing
his
sufferings
.
They
were
only
the
memory
,
the
*NL*
perpetuation
of
a
suffering
that
had
come
to
him
from
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
without
,
however
,
everything
brought
him
fresh
suffering
.
He
*NL*
decided
to
separate
Odette
from
Forcheville
,
by
taking
her
away
for
a
*NL*
few
days
to
the
south
.
But
he
imagined
that
she
was
coveted
by
every
*NL*
male
person
in
the
hotel
,
and
that
she
coveted
them
in
return
.
And
so
*NL*
he
,
who
,
in
old
days
,
when
he
travelled
,
used
always
to
seek
out
new
*NL*
people
and
crowded
places
,
might
now
be
seen
fleeing
savagely
from
human
*NL*
society
as
if
it
had
cruelly
injured
him
.
And
how
could
he
not
have
*NL*
turned
misanthrope
,
when
in
every
man
he
saw
a
potential
lover
for
*NL*
Odette
?
Thus
his
jealousy
did
even
more
than
the
happy
,
passionate
*NL*
desire
which
he
had
originally
felt
for
Odette
had
done
to
alter
Swann
's
*NL*
character
,
completely
changing
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
even
the
*NL*
outward
signs
by
which
that
character
had
been
intelligible
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
month
after
the
evening
on
which
he
had
intercepted
and
read
Odette
's
*NL*
letter
to
Forcheville
,
Swann
went
to
a
dinner
which
the
Verdurins
were
*NL*
giving
in
the
Bois
.
As
the
party
was
breaking
up
he
noticed
a
series
of
*NL*
whispered
discussions
between
Mme.
Verdurin
and
several
of
her
guests
,
*NL*
and
thought
that
he
heard
the
pianist
being
reminded
to
come
next
day
to
*NL*
a
party
at
Chatou
;
now
he
,
Swann
,
had
not
been
invited
to
any
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Verdurins
had
spoken
only
in
whispers
,
and
in
vague
terms
,
but
the
*NL*
painter
,
perhaps
without
thinking
,
shouted
out
:
``
There
must
be
no
lights
*NL*
of
any
sort
,
and
he
must
play
the
Moonlight
Sonata
in
the
dark
,
for
us
*NL*
to
see
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
,
seeing
that
Swann
was
within
earshot
,
assumed
that
*NL*
expression
in
which
the
two-fold
desire
to
make
the
speaker
be
quiet
and
*NL*
to
preserve
,
oneself
,
an
appearance
of
guilelessness
in
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
listener
,
is
neutralised
in
an
intense
vacuity
;
in
which
the
unflinching
*NL*
signs
of
intelligent
complicity
are
overlaid
by
the
smiles
of
innocence
,
*NL*
an
expression
invariably
adopted
by
anyone
who
has
noticed
a
blunder
,
*NL*
the
enormity
of
which
is
thereby
at
once
revealed
if
not
to
those
who
*NL*
have
made
it
,
at
any
rate
to
him
in
whose
hearing
it
ought
not
to
have
*NL*
been
made
.
Odette
seemed
suddenly
to
be
in
despair
,
as
though
she
had
*NL*
decided
not
to
struggle
any
longer
against
the
crushing
difficulties
of
*NL*
life
,
and
Swann
was
anxiously
counting
the
minutes
that
still
separated
*NL*
him
from
the
point
at
which
,
after
leaving
the
restaurant
,
while
he
*NL*
drove
her
home
,
he
would
be
able
to
ask
for
an
explanation
,
to
make
her
*NL*
promise
,
either
that
she
would
not
go
to
Chatou
next
day
,
or
that
she
*NL*
would
procure
an
invitation
for
him
also
,
and
to
lull
to
rest
in
her
*NL*
arms
the
anguish
that
still
tormented
him
.
At
last
the
carriages
were
*NL*
ordered
.
Mme.
Verdurin
said
to
Swann
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
then
.
We
shall
see
you
soon
,
I
hope
,
''
trying
,
by
the
*NL*
friendliness
of
her
manner
and
the
constraint
of
her
smile
,
to
prevent
*NL*
him
from
noticing
that
she
was
not
saying
,
as
she
would
always
have
*NL*
until
then
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
then
,
at
Chatou
,
and
at
my
house
the
day
after
.
''
M.
and
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
made
Forcheville
get
into
their
carriage
;
Swann
's
was
drawn
up
*NL*
behind
it
,
and
he
waited
for
theirs
to
start
before
helping
Odette
into
*NL*
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Odette
,
we
'll
take
you
,
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
,
``
we
've
kept
a
little
*NL*
corner
specially
for
you
,
beside
M.
de
Forcheville
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mme.
Verdurin
,
''
said
Odette
meekly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
I
thought
I
was
to
take
you
home
,
''
cried
Swann
,
flinging
*NL*
discretion
to
the
winds
,
for
the
carriage-door
hung
open
,
time
was
*NL*
precious
,
and
he
could
not
,
in
his
present
state
,
go
home
without
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mme.
Verdurin
has
asked
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
you
can
quite
well
go
home
alone
;
we
've
left
you
like
*NL*
this
dozens
of
times
,
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
had
something
important
to
tell
Mme.
de
Cr√©cy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
you
can
write
it
to
her
instead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
said
Odette
,
holding
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
hard
to
smile
,
but
could
only
succeed
in
looking
utterly
*NL*
dejected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
the
airs
that
Swann
is
pleased
to
put
on
with
*NL*
us
?
''
Mme.
Verdurin
asked
her
husband
when
they
had
reached
home
.
``
I
was
*NL*
afraid
he
was
going
to
eat
me
,
simply
because
we
offered
to
take
Odette
*NL*
back
.
It
really
is
too
bad
,
that
sort
of
thing
.
Why
does
n't
he
say
,
*NL*
straight
out
,
that
we
keep
a
disorderly
house
?
I
ca
n't
conceive
how
*NL*
Odette
can
stand
such
manners
.
He
positively
seems
to
be
saying
,
all
the
*NL*
time
,
`
You
belong
to
me
!
'
I
shall
tell
Odette
exactly
what
I
think
about
*NL*
it
all
,
and
I
hope
she
will
have
the
sense
to
understand
me
.
''
A
moment
*NL*
later
she
added
,
inarticulate
with
rage
:
``
No
,
but
,
do
n't
you
see
,
the
*NL*
filthy
creature
...
''
using
unconsciously
,
and
perhaps
in
satisfaction
of
*NL*
the
same
obscure
need
to
justify
herself
--
like
Fran√ßoise
at
Combray
when
*NL*
the
chicken
refused
to
die
--
the
very
words
which
the
last
convulsions
of
*NL*
an
inoffensive
animal
in
its
death
agony
wring
from
the
peasant
who
is
*NL*
engaged
in
taking
its
life
.
And
when
Mme.
Verdurin
's
carriage
had
moved
*NL*
on
,
and
Swann
's
took
its
place
,
his
coachman
,
catching
sight
of
his
*NL*
face
,
asked
whether
he
was
unwell
,
or
had
heard
bad
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
sent
him
away
;
he
preferred
to
walk
,
and
it
was
on
foot
,
through
*NL*
the
Bois
,
that
he
came
home
.
He
talked
to
himself
,
aloud
,
and
in
*NL*
the
same
slightly
affected
tone
which
he
had
been
used
to
adopt
*NL*
when
describing
the
charms
of
the
`
little
nucleus
'
and
extolling
the
*NL*
magnanimity
of
the
Verdurins
.
But
just
as
the
conversation
,
the
smiles
,
*NL*
the
kisses
of
Odette
became
as
odious
to
him
as
he
had
once
found
*NL*
them
charming
,
if
they
were
diverted
to
others
than
himself
,
so
the
*NL*
Verdurins
'
drawing-room
,
which
,
not
an
hour
before
,
had
still
seemed
*NL*
to
him
amusing
,
inspired
with
a
genuine
feeling
for
art
and
even
with
*NL*
a
sort
of
moral
aristocracy
,
now
that
it
was
another
than
himself
whom
*NL*
Odette
was
going
to
meet
there
,
to
love
there
without
restraint
,
laid
*NL*
bare
to
him
all
its
absurdities
,
its
stupidity
,
its
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
a
fanciful
picture
,
at
which
he
shuddered
in
disgust
,
of
the
*NL*
party
next
evening
at
Chatou
.
``
Imagine
going
to
Chatou
,
of
all
places
!
*NL*
Like
a
lot
of
drapers
after
closing
time
!
Upon
my
word
,
these
people
are
*NL*
sublime
in
their
smugness
;
they
ca
n't
really
exist
;
they
must
all
have
*NL*
come
out
of
one
of
Labiche
's
plays
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Cottards
would
be
there
;
possibly
Brichot
.
``
Could
anything
be
more
*NL*
grotesque
than
the
lives
of
these
little
creatures
,
hanging
on
to
one
*NL*
another
like
that
.
They
'd
imagine
they
were
utterly
lost
,
upon
my
soul
*NL*
they
would
,
if
they
did
n't
all
meet
again
to-morrow
at
_
Chatou
_
!
''
*NL*
Alas
!
there
would
be
the
painter
there
also
,
the
painter
who
enjoyed
*NL*
match-making
,
who
would
invite
Forcheville
to
come
with
Odette
to
his
*NL*
studio
.
He
could
see
Odette
,
in
a
dress
far
too
smart
for
the
country
,
*NL*
``
for
she
is
so
vulgar
in
that
way
,
and
,
poor
little
thing
,
she
is
such
a
*NL*
fool
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hear
the
jokes
that
Mme.
Verdurin
would
make
after
dinner
,
*NL*
jokes
which
,
whoever
the
`
bore
'
might
be
at
whom
they
were
aimed
,
*NL*
had
always
amused
him
because
he
could
watch
Odette
laughing
at
them
,
*NL*
laughing
with
him
,
her
laughter
almost
a
part
of
his
.
Now
he
felt
that
*NL*
it
was
possibly
at
him
that
they
would
make
Odette
laugh
.
``
What
a
fetid
*NL*
form
of
humour
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
twisting
his
mouth
into
an
expression
of
*NL*
disgust
so
violent
that
he
could
feel
the
muscles
of
his
throat
stiffen
*NL*
against
his
collar
.
``
How
,
in
God
's
name
,
can
a
creature
made
in
His
*NL*
image
find
anything
to
laugh
at
in
those
nauseating
witticisms
?
The
*NL*
least
sensitive
nose
must
be
driven
away
in
horror
from
such
stale
*NL*
exhalations
.
It
is
really
impossible
to
believe
that
any
human
being
is
*NL*
incapable
of
understanding
that
,
in
allowing
herself
merely
to
smile
at
*NL*
the
expense
of
a
fellow-creature
who
has
loyally
held
out
his
hand
*NL*
to
her
,
she
is
casting
herself
into
a
mire
from
which
it
will
be
*NL*
impossible
,
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
,
ever
to
rescue
her
.
I
dwell
*NL*
so
many
miles
above
the
puddles
in
which
these
filthy
little
vermin
*NL*
sprawl
and
crawl
and
bawl
their
cheap
obscenities
,
that
I
can
not
*NL*
possibly
be
spattered
by
the
witticisms
of
a
Verdurin
!
''
he
cried
,
*NL*
tossing
up
his
head
and
arrogantly
straightening
his
body
.
``
God
knows
*NL*
that
I
have
honestly
attempted
to
pull
Odette
out
of
that
sewer
,
and
to
*NL*
teach
her
to
breathe
a
nobler
and
a
purer
air
.
But
human
patience
has
*NL*
its
limits
,
and
mine
is
at
an
end
,
''
he
concluded
,
as
though
this
sacred
*NL*
mission
to
tear
Odette
away
from
an
atmosphere
of
sarcasms
dated
from
*NL*
longer
than
a
few
minutes
ago
,
as
though
he
had
not
undertaken
it
only
*NL*
since
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
those
sarcasms
might
,
perchance
,
be
*NL*
directed
at
himself
,
and
might
have
the
effect
of
detaching
Odette
from
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
see
the
pianist
sitting
down
to
play
the
Moonlight
Sonata
,
and
*NL*
the
grimaces
of
Mme.
Verdurin
,
in
terrified
anticipation
of
the
wrecking
*NL*
of
her
nerves
by
Beethoven
's
music
.
``
Idiot
,
liar
!
''
he
shouted
,
``
and
a
*NL*
creature
like
that
imagines
that
she
's
fond
of
_
Art
_
!
''
She
would
say
to
*NL*
Odette
,
after
deftly
insinuating
a
few
words
of
praise
for
Forcheville
,
*NL*
as
she
had
so
often
done
for
himself
:
``
You
can
make
room
for
M.
de
*NL*
Forcheville
there
,
ca
n't
you
,
Odette
?
''
...
'
``
In
the
dark
!
'
Codfish
!
*NL*
Pander
!
''
...
`
Pander
'
was
the
name
he
applied
also
to
the
music
which
*NL*
would
invite
them
to
sit
in
silence
,
to
dream
together
,
to
gaze
in
each
*NL*
other
's
eyes
,
to
feel
for
each
other
's
hands
.
He
felt
that
there
was
*NL*
much
to
be
said
,
after
all
,
for
a
sternly
censorous
attitude
towards
*NL*
the
arts
,
such
as
Plato
adopted
,
and
Bossuet
,
and
the
old
school
of
*NL*
education
in
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
the
life
which
they
led
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
which
he
had
so
*NL*
often
described
as
`
genuine
,
'
seemed
to
him
now
the
worst
possible
form
*NL*
of
life
,
and
their
`
little
nucleus
'
the
most
degraded
class
of
society
.
*NL*
``
It
really
is
,
''
he
repeated
,
``
beneath
the
lowest
rung
of
the
social
*NL*
ladder
,
the
nethermost
circle
of
Dante
.
Beyond
a
doubt
,
the
august
words
*NL*
of
the
Florentine
refer
to
the
Verdurins
!
When
one
comes
to
think
of
it

*NL*
surely

,
though
one
may
find
fault
with
them

then

all

are
a
very
different

a
profound
sagacity
in
refusing
to
know
*NL*
them
,
or
even
to
dirty
the
tips
of
their
fingers
with
them
.
What
a
sound
*NL*
intuition
there
is
in
that
'
_
Noli
me
tangere

motto
of
the
Faubourg

Saint-Germain

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
long
since
emerged
from
the
paths
and
avenues
of
the
Bois
,
he
had
*NL*
almost
reached
his
own
house
,
and
still
,
for
he
had
not
yet
thrown
off
*NL*
the
intoxication
of
grief
,
or
his
whim
of
insincerity
,
but
was
ever
more
*NL*
and
more
exhilarated
by
the
false
intonation
,
the
artificial
sonority
*NL*
of
his
own
voice
,
he
continued
to
perorate
aloud
in
the
silence
of
the
*NL*
night
:
``
People
`
in
society
'
have
their
failings
,
as
no
one
knows
better
*NL*
than
I
;
but
,
after
all
,
they
are
people
to
whom
some
things
,
at
least
,
*NL*
are
impossible
.
So-and-so
''
-LRB-
a
fashionable
woman
whom
he
had
known
-RRB-
*NL*
``
was
far
from
being
perfect
,
but
,
after
all
,
one
did
find
in
her
a
*NL*
fundamental
delicacy
,
a
loyalty
in
her
conduct
which
made
her
,
whatever
*NL*
happened
,
incapable
of
a
felony
,
which
fixes
a
vast
gulf
between
her
and
*NL*
an
old
hag
like
Verdurin

Verdurin
!
What
a
name
!
Oh
,
there
's
something
*NL*
complete
about
them

something
almost
fine
in
their
trueness
to
type
;
*NL*
they
're
the
most
perfect
specimens
of
their
disgusting
class

Thank
God
,
*NL*
it
was
high
time
that
I
stopped
condescending
to
promiscuous
intercourse
*NL*
with
such
infamy
,
such
dung

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
just
as
the
virtues
which
he
had
still
attributed
,
an
hour
or
so
*NL*
earlier
,
to
the
Verdurins
,
would
not
have
sufficed
,
even
although
the
*NL*
Verdurins
had
actually
possessed
them
,
if
they
had
not
also
favoured
*NL*
and
protected
his
love
,
to
excite
Swann
to
that
state
of
intoxication
*NL*
in
which
he
waxed
tender
over
their
magnanimity
,
an
intoxication
which
,
*NL*
even
when
disseminated
through
the
medium
of
other
persons
,
could
*NL*
have
come
to
him
from
Odette
alone
;
--
so
the
immorality
-LRB-
had
it
really
*NL*
existed
-RRB-
which
he
now
found
in
the
Verdurins
would
have
been
powerless
,
*NL*
if
they
had
not
invited
Odette
with
Forcheville
and
without
him
,
to
*NL*
unstop
the
vials
of
his
wrath
and
to
make
him
scarify
their
`
infamy
.
'
*NL*
Doubtless
Swann
's
voice
shewed
a
finer
perspicacity
than
his
own
when
it
*NL*
refused
to
utter
those
words
full
of
disgust
at
the
Verdurins
and
their
*NL*
circle
,
and
of
joy
at
his
having
shaken
himself
free
of
it
,
save
in
an
*NL*
artificial
and
rhetorical
tone
,
and
as
though
his
words
had
been
chosen
*NL*
rather
to
appease
his
anger
than
to
express
his
thoughts
.
The
latter
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
while
he
abandoned
himself
to
invective
,
were
probably
,
though
he
*NL*
did
not
know
it
,
occupied
with
a
wholly
different
matter
,
for
once
he
*NL*
had
reached
his
house
,
no
sooner
had
he
closed
the
front-door
behind
him
*NL*
than
he
suddenly
struck
his
forehead
,
and
,
making
his
servant
open
the
*NL*
door
again
,
dashed
out
into
the
street
shouting
,
in
a
voice
which
,
*NL*
this
time
,
was
quite
natural
;
``
I
believe
I
have
found
a
way
of
getting
*NL*
invited
to
the
dinner
at
Chatou
to-morrow
!
''
But
it
must
have
been
a
*NL*
bad
way
,
for
M.
Swann
was
not
invited
;
Dr.
Cottard
,
who
,
having
been
*NL*
summoned
to
attend
a
serious
case
in
the
country
,
had
not
seen
the
*NL*
Verdurins
for
some
days
,
and
had
been
prevented
from
appearing
at
*NL*
Chatou
,
said
,
on
the
evening
after
this
dinner
,
as
he
sat
down
to
table
*NL*
at
their
house
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
are
n't
we
going
to
see
M.
Swann
this
evening
?
He
is
quite
what
you
*NL*
might
call
a
personal
friend
...
''
``
I
sincerely
trust
that
we
sha
'n'
t
!
''
*NL*
cried
Mme.
Verdurin
.
``
Heaven
preserve
us
from
him
;
he
's
too
deadly
for
*NL*
words
,
a
stupid
,
ill-bred
boor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
these
words
Cottard
exhibited
an
intense
astonishment
blended
*NL*
with
entire
submission
,
as
though
in
the
face
of
a
scientific
truth
*NL*
which
contradicted
everything
that
he
had
previously
believed
,
but
was
*NL*
supported
by
an
irresistible
weight
of
evidence
;
with
timorous
*NL*
emotion
he
bowed
his
head
over
his
plate
,
and
merely
replied
:
*NL*
``
Oh
--
oh
--
oh
--
oh
--
oh
!
''
traversing
,
in
an
orderly
retirement
of
his
*NL*
forces
,
into
the
depths
of
his
being
,
along
a
descending
scale
,
the
*NL*
whole
compass
of
his
voice
.
After
which
there
was
no
more
talk
of
Swann
*NL*
at
the
Verdurins
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
that
drawing-room
which
had
brought
Swann
and
Odette
together
*NL*
became
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
their
meeting
.
She
no
longer
said
to
*NL*
him
,
as
she
had
said
in
the
early
days
of
their
love
:
``
We
shall
meet
,
*NL*
anyhow
,
to-morrow
evening
;
there
's
a
supper-party
at
the
Verdurins

,
''
*NL*
but
``
We
sha
'n'
t
be
able
to
meet
to-morrow
evening
;
there
's
a
*NL*
supper-party
at
the
Verdurins
'
.
''
Or
else
the
Verdurins
were
taking
her
*NL*
to
the
Op√©ra-Comique
,
to
see
_
Une
Nuit
de
Cl√©op√¢tre
_
,
and
Swann
could
*NL*
read
in
her
eyes
that
terror
lest
he
should
ask
her
not
to
go
,
which
,
*NL*
but
a
little
time
before
,
he
could
not
have
refrained
from
greeting
*NL*
with
a
kiss
as
it
flitted
across
the
face
of
his
mistress
,
but
which
now
*NL*
exasperated
him
.
``
Yet
I
'm
not
really
angry
,
''
he
assured
himself
,
``
when
I
*NL*
see
how
she
longs
to
run
away
and
scratch
from
maggots
in
that
*NL*
dunghill
of
cacophony
.
I
'm
disappointed
;
not
for
myself
,
but
for
her
;
*NL*
disappointed
to
find
that
,
after
living
for
more
than
six
months
in
*NL*
daily
contact
with
myself
,
she
has
not
been
capable
of
improving
her
*NL*
mind
even
to
the
point
of
spontaneously
eradicating
from
it
a
taste
for
*NL*
Victor
Mass√©
!
More
than
that
,
to
find
that
she
has
not
arrived
at
the
*NL*
stage
of
understanding
that
there
are
evenings
on
which
anyone
with
*NL*
the
least
shade
of
refinement
of
feeling
should
be
willing
to
forego
*NL*
an
amusement
when
she
is
asked
to
do
so
.
She
ought
to
have
the
sense
to
*NL*
say
:
'
I
shall
not
go
,
'
if
it
were
only
from
policy
,
since
it
is
by
what
*NL*
she
answers
now
that
the
quality
of
her
soul
will
be
determined
once
and
*NL*
for
all
.
''
And
having
persuaded
himself
that
it
was
solely
,
after
all
,
*NL*
in
order
that
he
might
arrive
at
a
favourable
estimate
of
Odette
's
*NL*
spiritual
worth
that
he
wished
her
to
stay
at
home
with
him
that
evening
*NL*
instead
of
going
to
the
Op√©ra-Comique
,
he
adopted
the
same
line
of
*NL*
reasoning
with
her
,
with
the
same
degree
of
insincerity
as
he
had
*NL*
used
with
himself
,
or
even
with
a
degree
more
,
for
in
her
case
he
was
*NL*
yielding
also
to
the
desire
to
capture
her
by
her
own
self-esteem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
to
you
,
''
he
told
her
,
shortly
before
she
was
to
leave
for
the
*NL*
theatre
,
``
that
,
in
asking
you
not
to
go
,
I
should
hope
,
were
I
a
*NL*
selfish
man
,
for
nothing
so
much
as
that
you
should
refuse
,
for
I
have
*NL*
a
thousand
other
things
to
do
this
evening
,
and
I
shall
feel
that
I
have
*NL*
been
tricked
and
trapped
myself
,
and
shall
be
thoroughly
annoyed
,
if
,
*NL*
after
all
,
you
tell
me
that
you
are
not
going
.
But
my
occupations
,
my
*NL*
pleasures
are
not
everything
;
I
must
think
of
you
also
.
A
day
may
come
*NL*
when
,
seeing
me
irrevocably
sundered
from
you
,
you
will
be
entitled
to
*NL*
reproach
me
with
not
having
warned
you
at
the
decisive
hour
in
which
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
was
going
to
pass
judgment
on
you
,
one
of
those
stern
*NL*
judgments
which
love
can
not
long
resist
.
You
see
,
your
_
Nuit
de
*NL*
Cl√©op√¢tre
_
-LRB-
what
a
title
!
-RRB-
has
no
bearing
on
the
point
.
What
I
must
know
*NL*
is
whether
you
are
indeed
one
of
those
creatures
in
the
lowest
grade
of
*NL*
mentality
and
even
of
charm
,
one
of
those
contemptible
creatures
who
are
*NL*
incapable
of
foregoing
a
pleasure
.
For
if
you
are
such
,
how
could
anyone
*NL*
love
you
,
for
you
are
not
even
a
person
,
a
definite
,
imperfect
,
but
at
*NL*
least
perceptible
entity
.
You
are
a
formless
water
that
will
trickle
*NL*
down
any
slope
that
it
may
come
upon
,
a
fish
devoid
of
memory
,
incapable
*NL*
of
thought
,
which
all
its
life
long
in
its
aquarium
will
continue
to
*NL*
dash
itself
,
a
hundred
times
a
day
,
against
a
wall
of
glass
,
always
*NL*
mistaking
it
for
water
.
Do
you
realise
that
your
answer
will
have
the
*NL*
effect
--
I
do
not
say
of
making
me
cease
from
that
moment
to
love
you
,
*NL*
that
goes
without
saying
,
but
of
making
you
less
attractive
to
my
*NL*
eyes
when
I
realise
that
you
are
not
a
person
,
that
you
are
beneath
*NL*
everything
in
the
world
and
have
not
the
intelligence
to
raise
yourself
*NL*
one
inch
higher
?
Obviously
,
I
should
have
preferred
to
ask
you
,
as
*NL*
though
it
had
been
a
matter
of
little
or
no
importance
,
to
give
up
your
*NL*
_
Nuit
de
Cl√©op√¢tre
_
-LRB-
since
you
compel
me
to
sully
my
lips
with
so
abject
*NL*
a
name
-RRB-
,
in
the
hope
that
you
would
go
to
it
none
the
less
.
But
,
since
*NL*
I
had
resolved
to
weigh
you
in
the
balance
,
to
make
so
grave
an
issue
*NL*
depend
upon
your
answer
,
I
considered
it
more
honourable
to
give
you
due
*NL*
warning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Odette
had
shewn
signs
of
increasing
emotion
and
uncertainty
.
*NL*
Although
the
meaning
of
his
tirade
was
beyond
her
,
she
grasped
that
it
*NL*
was
to
be
included
among
the
scenes
of
reproach
or
supplication
,
scenes
*NL*
which
her
familiarity
with
the
ways
of
men
enabled
her
,
without
paying
*NL*
any
heed
to
the
words
that
were
uttered
,
to
conclude
that
men
would
not
*NL*
make
unless
they
were
in
love
;
that
,
from
the
moment
when
they
were
in
*NL*
love
,
it
was
superfluous
to
obey
them
,
since
they
would
only
be
more
in
*NL*
love
later
on
.
And
so
,
she
would
have
heard
Swann
out
with
the
utmost
*NL*
tranquillity
had
she
not
noticed
that
it
was
growing
late
,
and
that
if
*NL*
he
went
on
speaking
for
any
length
of
time
she
would
``
never
''
as
she
told
*NL*
him
with
a
fond
smile
,
obstinate
but
slightly
abashed
,
``
get
there
in
*NL*
time
for
the
Overture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
other
occasions
he
had
assured
himself
that
the
one
thing
which
,
*NL*
more
than
anything
else
,
would
make
him
cease
to
love
her
,
would
be
her
*NL*
refusal
to
abandon
the
habit
of
lying
.
``
Even
from
the
point
of
view
of
*NL*
coquetry
,
pure
and
simple
,
''
he
had
told
her
,
``
ca
n't
you
see
how
much
*NL*
of
your
attraction
you
throw
away
when
you
stoop
to
lying
?
By
a
frank
*NL*
admission
--
how
many
faults
you
might
redeem
!
Really
,
you
are
far
less
*NL*
intelligent
than
I
supposed
!
''
In
vain
,
however
,
did
Swann
expound
to
*NL*
her
thus
all
the
reasons
that
she
had
for
not
lying
;
they
might
have
*NL*
succeeded
in
overthrowing
any
universal
system
of
mendacity
,
but
Odette
*NL*
had
no
such
system
;
she
contented
herself
,
merely
,
whenever
she
wished
*NL*
Swann
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
anything
that
she
had
done
,
with
not
*NL*
telling
him
of
it
.
So
that
a
lie
was
,
to
her
,
something
to
be
used
only
*NL*
as
a
special
expedient
;
and
the
one
thing
that
could
make
her
decide
*NL*
whether
she
should
avail
herself
of
a
lie
or
not
was
a
reason
which
,
*NL*
too
,
was
of
a
special
and
contingent
order
,
namely
the
risk
of
Swann
's
*NL*
discovering
that
she
had
not
told
him
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Physically
,
she
was
passing
through
an
unfortunate
phase
;
she
was
*NL*
growing
stouter
,
and
the
expressive
,
sorrowful
charm
,
the
surprised
,
*NL*
wistful
expressions
which
she
had
formerly
had
,
seemed
to
have
vanished
*NL*
with
her
first
youth
,
with
the
result
that
she
became
most
precious
to
*NL*
Swann
at
the
very
moment
when
he
found
her
distinctly
less
good-looking
.
*NL*
He
would
gaze
at
her
for
hours
on
end
,
trying
to
recapture
the
charm
*NL*
which
he
had
once
seen
in
her
and
could
not
find
again
.
And
yet
the
*NL*
knowledge
that
,
within
this
new
and
strange
chrysalis
,
it
was
still
*NL*
Odette
that
lurked
,
still
the
same
volatile
temperament
,
artful
and
*NL*
evasive
,
was
enough
to
keep
Swann
seeking
,
with
as
much
passion
as
ever
,
*NL*
to
captivate
her
.
Then
he
would
look
at
photographs
of
her
,
taken
two
*NL*
years
before
,
and
would
remember
how
exquisite
she
had
been
.
And
that
*NL*
would
console
him
,
a
little
,
for
all
the
sufferings
that
he
voluntarily
*NL*
endured
on
her
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Verdurins
took
her
off
to
Saint-Germain
,
or
to
Chatou
,
or
to
*NL*
Meulan
,
as
often
as
not
,
if
the
weather
was
fine
,
they
would
propose
*NL*
to
remain
there
for
the
night
,
and
not
go
home
until
next
day
.
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
would
endeavour
to
set
at
rest
the
scruples
of
the
pianist
,
*NL*
whose
aunt
had
remained
in
Paris
:
``
She
will
be
only
too
glad
to
be
rid
*NL*
of
you
for
a
day
.
How
on
earth
could
she
be
anxious
,
when
she
knows
*NL*
you
're
with
us
?
Anyhow
,
I
'll
take
you
all
under
my
wing
;
she
can
put
the
*NL*
blame
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
this
attempt
failed
,
M.
Verdurin
would
set
off
across
country
until
*NL*
he
came
to
a
telegraph
office
or
some
other
kind
of
messenger
,
after
*NL*
first
finding
out
which
of
the
`
faithful
'
had
anyone
whom
they
must
*NL*
warn
.
But
Odette
would
thank
him
,
and
assure
him
that
she
had
no
message
*NL*
for
anyone
,
for
she
had
told
Swann
,
once
and
for
all
,
that
she
could
*NL*
not
possibly
send
messages
to
him
,
before
all
those
people
,
without
*NL*
compromising
herself
.
Sometimes
she
would
be
absent
for
several
days
*NL*
on
end
,
when
the
Verdurins
took
her
to
see
the
tombs
at
Dreux
,
or
to
*NL*
Compi√®gne
,
on
the
painter
's
advice
,
to
watch
the
sun
setting
through
the
*NL*
forest
--
after
which
they
went
on
to
the
Ch√¢teau
of
Pierrefonds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
that
she
could
visit
really
historic
buildings
with
me
,
who
*NL*
have
spent
ten
years
in
the
study
of
architecture
,
who
am
constantly
*NL*
bombarded
,
by
people
who
really
count
,
to
take
them
over
Beauvais
or
*NL*
Saint-Loup-de-Naud
,
and
refuse
to
take
anyone
but
her
;
and
instead
of
*NL*
that
she
trundles
off
with
the
lowest
,
the
most
brutally
degraded
*NL*
of
creatures
,
to
go
into
ecstasies
over
the
petrified
excretions
of
*NL*
Louis-Philippe
and
Viollet-le-Duc
!
One
hardly
needs
much
knowledge
*NL*
of
art
,
I
should
say
,
to
do
that
;
though
,
surely
,
even
without
any
*NL*
particularly
refined
sense
of
smell
,
one
would
not
deliberately
choose
*NL*
to
spend
a
holiday
in
the
latrines
,
so
as
to
be
within
range
of
their
*NL*
fragrant
exhalations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
had
set
off
for
Dreux
or
Pierrefonds
--
alas
,
without
*NL*
allowing
him
to
appear
there
,
as
though
by
accident
,
at
her
side
,
for
,
*NL*
as
she
said
,
that
would
``
create
a
dreadful
impression
,
''
--
he
would
plunge
*NL*
into
the
most
intoxicating
romance
in
the
lover
's
library
,
the
railway
*NL*
timetable
,
from
which
he
learned
the
ways
of
joining
her
there
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
in
the
evening
,
even
in
the
morning
.
The
ways
?
More
than
*NL*
that
,
the
authority
,
the
right
to
join
her
.
For
,
after
all
,
the
*NL*
time-table
,
and
the
trains
themselves
,
were
not
meant
for
dogs
.
If
the
*NL*
public
were
carefully
informed
,
by
means
of
printed
advertisements
,
that
*NL*
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
a
train
started
for
Pierrefonds
which
*NL*
arrived
there
at
ten
,
that
could
only
be
because
going
to
Pierrefonds
*NL*
was
a
lawful
act
,
for
which
permission
from
Odette
would
be
superfluous
;
*NL*
an
act
,
moreover
,
which
might
be
performed
from
a
motive
altogether
*NL*
different
from
the
desire
to
see
Odette
,
since
persons
who
had
never
*NL*
even
heard
of
her
performed
it
daily
,
and
in
such
numbers
as
justified
*NL*
the
labour
and
expense
of
stoking
the
engines
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
came
to
this
;
that
she
could
not
prevent
him
from
going
to
*NL*
Pierrefonds
if
he
chose
to
do
so
.
Now
that
was
precisely
what
he
found
*NL*
that
he
did
choose
to
do
,
and
would
at
that
moment
be
doing
were
he
,
*NL*
like
the
travelling
public
,
not
acquainted
with
Odette
.
For
a
long
*NL*
time
past
he
had
wanted
to
form
a
more
definite
impression
of
*NL*
Viollet-le-Duc
's
work
as
a
restorer
.
And
the
weather
being
what
it
was
,
*NL*
he
felt
an
overwhelming
desire
to
spend
the
day
roaming
in
the
forest
of
*NL*
Compi√®gne
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
piece
of
bad
luck
that
she
had
forbidden
him
access
*NL*
to
the
one
spot
that
tempted
him
to-day
.
To-day
!
Why
,
if
he
went
down
*NL*
there
,
in
defiance
of
her
prohibition
,
he
would
be
able
to
see
her
that
*NL*
very
day
!
But
then
,
whereas
,
if
she
had
met
,
at
Pierrefonds
,
some
one
*NL*
who
did
not
matter
,
she
would
have
hailed
him
with
obvious
pleasure
:
*NL*
``
What
,
you
here
?
''
and
would
have
invited
him
to
come
and
see
her
at
the
*NL*
hotel
where
she
was
staying
with
the
Verdurins
,
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
it
was
himself
,
Swann
,
that
she
encountered
there
,
she
would
be
annoyed
,
*NL*
would
complain
that
she
was
being
followed
,
would
love
him
less
in
*NL*
consequence
,
might
even
turn
away
in
anger
when
she
caught
sight
of
him
.
*NL*
``
So
,
then
,
I
am
not
to
be
allowed
to
go
away
for
a
day
anywhere
!
''
she
*NL*
would
reproach
him
on
her
return
,
whereas
in
fact
it
was
he
himself
who
*NL*
was
not
allowed
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
had
the
sudden
idea
,
so
as
to
contrive
to
visit
Compi√®gne
and
*NL*
Pierrefonds
without
letting
it
be
supposed
that
his
object
was
to
meet
*NL*
Odette
,
of
securing
an
invitation
from
one
of
his
friends
,
the
Marquis
*NL*
de
Forestelle
,
who
had
a
country
house
in
that
neighbourhood
.
This
*NL*
friend
,
to
whom
Swann
suggested
the
plan
without
disclosing
its
*NL*
ulterior
purpose
,
was
beside
himself
with
joy
;
he
did
not
conceal
his
*NL*
astonishment
at
Swann
's
consenting
at
last
,
after
fifteen
years
,
to
come
*NL*
down
and
visit
his
property
,
and
since
he
did
not
-LRB-
he
told
him
-RRB-
wish
*NL*
to
stay
there
,
promised
to
spend
some
days
,
at
least
,
in
taking
him
for
*NL*
walks
and
excursions
in
the
district
.
Swann
imagined
himself
down
there
*NL*
already
with
M.
de
Forestelle
.
Even
before
he
saw
Odette
,
even
if
he
did
*NL*
not
succeed
in
seeing
her
there
,
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
set
foot
on
*NL*
that
soil
where
,
not
knowing
the
exact
spot
in
which
,
at
any
moment
,
she
*NL*
was
to
be
found
,
he
would
feel
all
around
him
the
thrilling
possibility
*NL*
of
her
suddenly
appearing
:
in
the
courtyard
of
the
Ch√¢teau
,
now
*NL*
beautiful
in
his
eyes
since
it
was
on
her
account
that
he
had
gone
to
*NL*
visit
it
;
in
all
the
streets
of
the
town
,
which
struck
him
as
romantic
;
*NL*
down
every
ride
of
the
forest
,
roseate
with
the
deep
and
tender
glow
of
*NL*
sunset
;
--
innumerable
and
alternative
hiding-places
,
to
which
would
fly
*NL*
simultaneously
for
refuge
,
in
the
uncertain
ubiquity
of
his
hopes
,
his
*NL*
happy
,
vagabond
and
divided
heart
.
``
We
must
n't
,
on
any
account
,
''
he
*NL*
would
warn
M.
de
Forestelle
,
``
run
across
Odette
and
the
Verdurins
.
I
*NL*
have
just
heard
that
they
are
at
Pierrefonds
,
of
all
places
,
to-day
.
One
*NL*
has
plenty
of
time
to
see
them
in
Paris
;
it
would
hardly
be
worth
while
*NL*
coming
down
here
if
one
could
n't
go
a
yard
without
meeting
them
.
''
And
*NL*
his
host
would
fail
to
understand
why
,
once
they
had
reached
the
place
,
*NL*
Swann
would
change
his
plans
twenty
times
in
an
hour
,
inspect
the
*NL*
dining-rooms
of
all
the
hotels
in
Compi√®gne
without
being
able
to
make
*NL*
up
his
mind
to
settle
down
in
any
of
them
,
although
he
had
found
no
*NL*
trace
anywhere
of
the
Verdurins
,
seeming
to
be
in
search
of
what
he
had
*NL*
claimed
to
be
most
anxious
to
avoid
,
and
would
in
fact
avoid
,
the
moment
*NL*
he
found
it
,
for
if
he
had
come
upon
the
little
`
group
,
'
he
would
have
*NL*
hastened
away
at
once
with
studied
indifference
,
satisfied
that
he
had
*NL*
seen
Odette
and
she
him
,
especially
that
she
had
seen
him
when
he
was
*NL*
not
,
apparently
,
thinking
about
her
.
But
no
;
she
would
guess
at
*NL*
once
that
it
was
for
her
sake
that
he
had
come
there
.
And
when
M.
de
*NL*
Forestelle
came
to
fetch
him
,
and
it
was
time
to
start
,
he
excused
*NL*
himself
:
``
No
,
I
'm
afraid
not
;
I
ca
n't
go
to
Pierrefonds
to-day
.
You
see
,
*NL*
Odette
is
there
.
''
And
Swann
was
happy
in
spite
of
everything
in
feeling
*NL*
that
if
he
,
alone
among
mortals
,
had
not
the
right
to
go
to
Pierrefonds
*NL*
that
day
,
it
was
because
he
was
in
fact
,
for
Odette
,
some
one
who
*NL*
differed
from
all
other
mortals
,
her
lover
;
and
because
that
restriction
*NL*
which
for
him
alone
was
set
upon
the
universal
right
to
travel
freely
*NL*
where
one
would
,
was
but
one
of
the
many
forms
of
that
slavery
,
that
*NL*
love
which
was
so
dear
to
him
.
Decidedly
,
it
was
better
not
to
risk
a
*NL*
quarrel
with
her
,
to
be
patient
,
to
wait
for
her
return
.
He
spent
his
*NL*
days
in
poring
over
a
map
of
the
forest
of
Compi√®gne
,
as
though
it
*NL*
had
been
that
of
the
`
Pays
du
Tendre
'
;
he
surrounded
himself
with
*NL*
photographs
of
the
Ch√¢teau
of
Pierrefonds
.
When
the
day
dawned
on
which
*NL*
it
was
possible
that
she
might
return
,
he
opened
the
time-table
*NL*
again
,
calculated
what
train
she
must
have
taken
,
and
,
should
she
have
*NL*
postponed
her
departure
,
what
trains
were
still
left
for
her
to
take
.
He
*NL*
did
not
leave
the
house
,
for
fear
of
missing
a
telegram
,
he
did
not
go
*NL*
to
bed
,
in
case
,
having
come
by
the
last
train
,
she
decided
to
surprise
*NL*
him
with
a
midnight
visit
.
Yes
!
The
front-door
bell
rang
.
There
seemed
*NL*
some
delay
in
opening
the
door
,
he
wanted
to
awaken
the
porter
,
he
*NL*
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
shout
to
Odette
,
if
it
was
Odette
,
for
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
orders
which
he
had
gone
downstairs
a
dozen
times
to
*NL*
deliver
in
person
,
they
were
quite
capable
of
telling
her
that
he
was
*NL*
not
at
home
.
It
was
only
a
servant
coming
in
.
He
noticed
the
incessant
*NL*
rumble
of
passing
carriages
,
to
which
he
had
never
before
paid
any
*NL*
attention
.
He
could
hear
them
,
one
after
another
,
a
long
way
off
,
coming
*NL*
nearer
,
passing
his
door
without
stopping
,
and
bearing
away
into
the
*NL*
distance
a
message
which
was
not
for
him
.
He
waited
all
night
,
to
no
*NL*
purpose
,
for
the
Verdurins
had
returned
unexpectedly
,
and
Odette
had
*NL*
been
in
Paris
since
midday
;
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
tell
him
;
not
*NL*
knowing
what
to
do
with
herself
she
had
spent
the
evening
alone
at
a
*NL*
theatre
,
had
long
since
gone
home
to
bed
,
and
was
peacefully
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
she
had
never
given
him
a
thought
.
And
such
moments
*NL*
as
these
,
in
which
she
forgot
Swann
's
very
existence
,
were
of
more
value
*NL*
to
Odette
,
did
more
to
attach
him
to
her
,
than
all
her
infidelities
.
For
*NL*
in
this
way
Swann
was
kept
in
that
state
of
painful
agitation
which
had
*NL*
once
before
been
effective
in
making
his
interest
blossom
into
love
,
on
*NL*
the
night
when
he
had
failed
to
find
Odette
at
the
Verdurins
'
and
had
*NL*
hunted
for
her
all
evening
.
And
he
did
not
have
-LRB-
as
I
had
,
afterwards
,
*NL*
at
Combray
in
my
childhood
-RRB-
happy
days
in
which
to
forget
the
sufferings
*NL*
that
would
return
with
the
night
.
For
his
days
,
Swann
must
pass
them
*NL*
without
Odette
;
and
as
he
told
himself
,
now
and
then
,
to
allow
so
pretty
*NL*
a
woman
to
go
out
by
herself
in
Paris
was
just
as
rash
as
to
leave
a
*NL*
case
filled
with
jewels
in
the
middle
of
the
street
.
In
this
mood
he
*NL*
would
scowl
furiously
at
the
passers-by
,
as
though
they
were
so
many
*NL*
pickpockets
.
But
their
faces
--
a
collective
and
formless
mass
--
escaped
*NL*
the
grasp
of
his
imagination
,
and
so
failed
to
feed
the
flame
of
his
*NL*
jealousy
.
The
effort
exhausted
Swann
's
brain
,
until
,
passing
his
hand
*NL*
over
his
eyes
,
he
cried
out
:
``
Heaven
help
me
!
''
as
people
,
after
lashing
*NL*
themselves
into
an
intellectual
frenzy
in
their
endeavours
to
master
the
*NL*
problem
of
the
reality
of
the
external
world
,
or
that
of
the
immortality
*NL*
of
the
soul
,
afford
relief
to
their
weary
brains
by
an
unreasoning
*NL*
act
of
faith
.
But
the
thought
of
his
absent
mistress
was
incessantly
,
*NL*
indissolubly
blended
with
all
the
simplest
actions
of
Swann
's
daily
*NL*
life
--
when
he
took
his
meals
,
opened
his
letters
,
went
for
a
walk
or
*NL*
to
bed
--
by
the
fact
of
his
regret
at
having
to
perform
those
actions
*NL*
without
her
;
like
those
initials
of
Philibert
the
Fair
which
,
in
the
*NL*
church
of
Brou
,
because
of
her
grief
,
her
longing
for
him
,
Margaret
of
*NL*
Austria
intertwined
everywhere
with
her
own
.
On
some
days
,
instead
of
*NL*
staying
at
home
,
he
would
go
for
luncheon
to
a
restaurant
not
far
off
,
*NL*
to
which
he
had
been
attracted
,
some
time
before
,
by
the
excellence
of
*NL*
its
cookery
,
but
to
which
he
now
went
only
for
one
of
those
reasons
,
*NL*
at
once
mystical
and
absurd
,
which
people
call
`
romantic
'
;
because
this
*NL*
restaurant
-LRB-
which
,
by
the
way
,
still
exists
-RRB-
bore
the
same
name
as
the
*NL*
street
in
which
Odette
lived
:
the
Lap√©rouse
.
Sometimes
,
when
she
had
*NL*
been
away
on
a
short
visit
somewhere
,
several
days
would
elapse
before
*NL*
she
thought
of
letting
him
know
that
she
had
returned
to
Paris
.
And
*NL*
then
she
would
say
quite
simply
,
without
taking
-LRB-
as
she
would
once
have
*NL*
taken
-RRB-
the
precaution
of
covering
herself
,
at
all
costs
,
with
a
little
*NL*
fragment
borrowed
from
the
truth
,
that
she
had
just
,
at
that
very
*NL*
moment
,
arrived
by
the
morning
train
.
What
she
said
was
a
falsehood
;
*NL*
at
least
for
Odette
it
was
a
falsehood
,
inconsistent
,
lacking
-LRB-
what
it
*NL*
would
have
had
,
if
true
-RRB-
the
support
of
her
memory
of
her
actual
arrival
*NL*
at
the
station
;
she
was
even
prevented
from
forming
a
mental
picture
of
*NL*
what
she
was
saying
,
while
she
said
it
,
by
the
contradictory
picture
,
in
*NL*
her
mind
,
of
whatever
quite
different
thing
she
had
indeed
been
doing
at
*NL*
the
moment
when
she
pretended
to
have
been
alighting
from
the
train
.
In
*NL*
Swann
's
mind
,
however
,
these
words
,
meeting
no
opposition
,
settled
*NL*
and
hardened
until
they
assumed
the
indestructibility
of
a
truth
so
*NL*
indubitable
that
,
if
some
friend
happened
to
tell
him
that
he
had
*NL*
come
by
the
same
train
and
had
not
seen
Odette
,
Swann
would
have
been
*NL*
convinced
that
it
was
his
friend
who
had
made
a
mistake
as
to
the
day
or
*NL*
hour
,
since
his
version
did
not
agree
with
the
words
uttered
by
Odette
.
*NL*
These
words
had
never
appeared
to
him
false
except
when
,
before
hearing
*NL*
them
,
he
had
suspected
that
they
were
going
to
be
.
For
him
to
believe
*NL*
that
she
was
lying
,
an
anticipatory
suspicion
was
indispensable
.
It
was
*NL*
also
,
however
,
sufficient
.
Given
that
,
everything
that
Odette
might
say
*NL*
appeared
to
him
suspect
.
Did
she
mention
a
name
:
it
was
obviously
that
*NL*
of
one
of
her
lovers
;
once
this
supposition
had
taken
shape
,
he
would
*NL*
spend
weeks
in
tormenting
himself
;
on
one
occasion
he
even
approached
a
*NL*
firm
of
`
inquiry
agents
'
to
find
out
the
address
and
the
occupation
of
*NL*
the
unknown
rival
who
would
give
him
no
peace
until
he
could
be
proved
*NL*
to
have
gone
abroad
,
and
who
-LRB-
he
ultimately
learned
-RRB-
was
an
uncle
of
*NL*
Odette
,
and
had
been
dead
for
twenty
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
she
would
not
allow
him
,
as
a
rule
,
to
meet
her
at
public
*NL*
gatherings
,
saying
that
people
would
talk
,
it
happened
occasionally
*NL*
that
,
at
an
evening
party
to
which
he
and
she
had
each
been
invited
--
at
*NL*
Forcheville
's
,
at
the
painter
's
,
or
at
a
charity
ball
given
in
one
of
*NL*
the
Ministries
--
he
found
himself
in
the
same
room
with
her
.
He
could
*NL*
see
her
,
but
dared
not
remain
for
fear
of
annoying
her
by
seeming
to
be
*NL*
spying
upon
the
pleasures
which
she
tasted
in
other
company
,
pleasures
*NL*
which
--
while
he
drove
home
in
utter
loneliness
,
and
went
to
bed
,
*NL*
as
anxiously
as
I
myself
was
to
go
to
bed
,
some
years
later
,
on
the
*NL*
evenings
when
he
came
to
dine
with
us
at
Combray
--
seemed
illimitable
to
*NL*
him
since
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
their
end
.
And
,
once
or
twice
,
*NL*
he
derived
from
such
evenings
that
kind
of
happiness
which
one
would
be
*NL*
inclined
-LRB-
did
it
not
originate
in
so
violent
a
reaction
from
an
anxiety
*NL*
abruptly
terminated
-RRB-
to
call
peaceful
,
since
it
consists
in
a
pacifying
*NL*
of
the
mind
:
he
had
looked
in
for
a
moment
at
a
revel
in
the
painter
's
*NL*
studio
,
and
was
getting
ready
to
go
home
;
he
was
leaving
behind
him
*NL*
Odette
,
transformed
into
a
brilliant
stranger
,
surrounded
by
men
to
whom
*NL*
her
glances
and
her
gaiety
,
which
were
not
for
him
,
seemed
to
hint
at
*NL*
some
voluptuous
pleasure
to
be
enjoyed
there
or
elsewhere
-LRB-
possibly
at
*NL*
the
Bal
des
Incoh√©rents
,
to
which
he
trembled
to
think
that
she
might
be
*NL*
going
on
afterwards
-RRB-
which
made
Swann
more
jealous
than
the
thought
of
*NL*
their
actual
physical
union
,
since
it
was
more
difficult
to
imagine
;
he
*NL*
was
opening
the
door
to
go
,
when
he
heard
himself
called
back
in
these
*NL*
words
-LRB-
which
,
by
cutting
off
from
the
party
that
possible
ending
which
*NL*
had
so
appalled
him
,
made
the
party
itself
seem
innocent
in
retrospect
,
*NL*
made
Odette
's
return
home
a
thing
no
longer
inconceivable
and
terrible
,
*NL*
but
tender
and
familiar
,
a
thing
that
kept
close
to
his
side
,
like
*NL*
a
part
of
his
own
daily
life
,
in
his
carriage
;
a
thing
that
stripped
*NL*
Odette
herself
of
the
excess
of
brilliance
and
gaiety
in
her
appearance
,
*NL*
shewed
that
it
was
only
a
disguise
which
she
had
assumed
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
for
his
sake
and
not
in
view
of
any
mysterious
pleasures
,
a
disguise
of
*NL*
which
she
had
already
wearied
-RRB-
--
in
these
words
,
which
Odette
flung
out
*NL*
after
him
as
he
was
crossing
the
threshold
:
``
Ca
n't
you
wait
a
minute
for
*NL*
me
?
I
'm
just
going
;
we
'll
drive
back
together
and
you
can
drop
me
.
''
It
*NL*
was
true
that
on
one
occasion
Forcheville
had
asked
to
be
driven
home
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
but
when
,
on
reaching
Odette
's
gate
,
he
had
begged
to
be
*NL*
allowed
to
come
in
too
,
she
had
replied
,
with
a
finger
pointed
at
Swann
:
*NL*
``
Ah
!
That
depends
on
this
gentleman
.
You
must
ask
him
.
Very
well
,
you
*NL*
may
come
in
,
just
for
a
minute
,
if
you
insist
,
but
you
must
n't
stay
*NL*
long
,
for
,
I
warn
you
,
he
likes
to
sit
and
talk
quietly
with
me
,
and
*NL*
he
's
not
at
all
pleased
if
I
have
visitors
when
he
's
here
.
Oh
,
if
you
*NL*
only
knew
the
creature
as
I
know
him
;
is
n't
that
so
,
my
love
,
there
's
no
*NL*
one
that
really
knows
you
,
is
there
,
except
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Swann
was
,
perhaps
,
even
more
touched
by
the
spectacle
of
her
*NL*
addressing
him
thus
,
in
front
of
Forcheville
,
not
only
in
these
tender
*NL*
words
of
predilection
,
but
also
with
certain
criticisms
,
such
as
:
``
I
*NL*
feel
sure
you
have
n't
written
yet
to
your
friends
,
about
dining
with
*NL*
them
on
Sunday
.
You
need
n't
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
,
but
you
might
at
*NL*
least
be
polite
,
''
or
``
Now
,
have
you
left
your
essay
on
Vermeer
here
,
so
*NL*
that
you
can
do
a
little
more
to
it
to-morrow
?
What
a
lazy-bones
!
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
make
you
work
,
I
can
tell
you
,
''
which
proved
that
Odette
kept
*NL*
herself
in
touch
with
his
social
engagements
and
his
literary
work
,
that
*NL*
they
had
indeed
a
life
in
common
.
And
as
she
spoke
she
bestowed
on
him
a
*NL*
smile
which
he
interpreted
as
meaning
that
she
was
entirely
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
while
she
was
making
them
some
orangeade
,
suddenly
,
just
as
*NL*
when
the
reflector
of
a
lamp
that
is
badly
fitted
begins
by
casting
*NL*
all
round
an
object
,
on
the
wall
beyond
it
,
huge
and
fantastic
shadows
*NL*
which
,
in
time
,
contract
and
are
lost
in
the
shadow
of
the
object
*NL*
itself
,
all
the
terrible
and
disturbing
ideas
which
he
had
formed
of
*NL*
Odette
melted
away
and
vanished
in
the
charming
creature
who
stood
there
*NL*
before
his
eyes
.
He
had
the
sudden
suspicion
that
this
hour
spent
in
*NL*
Odette
's
house
,
in
the
lamp-light
,
was
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
not
an
*NL*
artificial
hour
,
invented
for
his
special
use
-LRB-
with
the
object
of
*NL*
concealing
that
frightening
and
delicious
thing
which
was
incessantly
*NL*
in
his
thoughts
without
his
ever
being
able
to
form
a
satisfactory
*NL*
impression
of
it
,
an
hour
of
Odette
's
real
life
,
of
her
life
when
he
was
*NL*
not
there
,
looking
on
-RRB-
with
theatrical
properties
and
pasteboard
fruits
,
*NL*
but
was
perhaps
a
genuine
hour
of
Odette
's
life
;
that
,
if
he
himself
*NL*
had
not
been
there
,
she
would
have
pulled
forward
the
same
armchair
for
*NL*
Forcheville
,
would
have
poured
out
for
him
,
not
any
unknown
brew
,
but
*NL*
precisely
that
orangeade
which
she
was
now
offering
to
them
both
;
that
*NL*
the
world
inhabited
by
Odette
was
not
that
other
world
,
fearful
and
*NL*
supernatural
,
in
which
he
spent
his
time
in
placing
her
--
and
which
*NL*
existed
,
perhaps
,
only
in
his
imagination
,
but
the
real
universe
,
*NL*
exhaling
no
special
atmosphere
of
gloom
,
comprising
that
table
at
which
*NL*
he
might
sit
down
,
presently
,
and
write
,
and
this
drink
which
he
was
*NL*
being
permitted
,
now
,
to
taste
;
all
the
objects
which
he
contemplated
*NL*
with
as
much
curiosity
and
admiration
as
gratitude
,
for
if
,
in
absorbing
*NL*
his
dreams
,
they
had
delivered
him
from
an
obsession
,
they
themselves
*NL*
were
,
in
turn
,
enriched
by
the
absorption
;
they
shewed
him
the
palpable
*NL*
realisation
of
his
fancies
,
and
they
interested
his
mind
;
they
took
*NL*
shape
and
grew
solid
before-his
eyes
,
and
at
the
same
time
they
soothed
*NL*
his
troubled
heart
.
Ah
!
had
fate
but
allowed
him
to
share
a
single
*NL*
dwelling
with
Odette
,
so
that
in
her
house
he
should
be
in
his
own
;
if
,
*NL*
when
asking
his
servant
what
there
would
be
for
luncheon
,
it
had
been
*NL*
Odette
's
bill
of
fare
that
he
had
learned
from
the
reply
;
if
,
when
*NL*
Odette
wished
to
go
for
a
walk
,
in
the
morning
,
along
the
Avenue
du
*NL*
Bois-de-Boulogne
,
his
duty
as
a
good
husband
had
obliged
him
,
though
he
*NL*
had
no
desire
to
go
out
,
to
accompany
her
,
carrying
her
cloak
when
she
*NL*
was
too
warm
;
and
in
the
evening
,
after
dinner
,
if
she
wished
to
stay
at
*NL*
home
,
and
not
to
dress
,
if
he
had
been
forced
to
stay
beside
her
,
to
*NL*
do
what
she
asked
;
then
how
completely
would
all
the
trivial
details
*NL*
of
Swann
's
life
,
which
seemed
to
him
now
so
gloomy
,
simply
because
they
*NL*
would
,
at
the
same
time
,
have
formed
part
of
the
life
of
Odette
,
have
*NL*
taken
on
--
like
that
lamp
,
that
orangeade
,
that
armchair
,
which
had
*NL*
absorbed
so
much
of
his
dreams
,
which
materialised
so
much
of
his
*NL*
longing
,
--
a
sort
of
superabundant
sweetness
and
a
mysterious
solidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
was
inclined
to
suspect
that
the
state
for
which
he
so
much
*NL*
longed
was
a
calm
,
a
peace
,
which
would
not
have
created
an
atmosphere
*NL*
favourable
to
his
love
.
When
Odette
ceased
to
be
for
him
a
creature
*NL*
always
absent
,
regretted
,
imagined
;
when
the
feeling
that
he
had
for
her
*NL*
was
no
longer
the
same
mysterious
disturbance
that
was
wrought
in
him
by
*NL*
the
phrase
from
the
sonata
,
but
constant
affection
and
gratitude
,
when
*NL*
those
normal
relations
were
established
between
them
which
would
put
an
*NL*
end
to
his
melancholy
madness
;
then
,
no
doubt
,
the
actions
of
Odette
's
*NL*
daily
life
would
appear
to
him
as
being
of
but
little
intrinsic
*NL*
interest
--
as
he
had
several
times
,
already
,
felt
that
they
might
be
,
*NL*
on
the
day
,
for
instance
,
when
he
had
read
,
through
its
envelope
,
her
*NL*
letter
to
Forcheville
.
Examining
his
complaint
with
as
much
scientific
*NL*
detachment
as
if
he
had
inoculated
himself
with
it
in
order
to
study
*NL*
its
effects
,
he
told
himself
that
,
when
he
was
cured
of
it
,
what
Odette
*NL*
might
or
might
not
do
would
be
indifferent
to
him
.
But
in
his
morbid
*NL*
state
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
feared
death
itself
no
more
than
such
a
*NL*
recovery
,
which
would
,
in
fact
,
amount
to
the
death
of
all
that
he
then
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
quiet
evenings
,
Swann
's
suspicions
would
be
temporarily
*NL*
lulled
;
he
would
bless
the
name
of
Odette
,
and
next
day
,
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
would
order
the
most
attractive
jewels
to
be
sent
to
her
,
because
her
*NL*
kindnesses
to
him
overnight
had
excited
either
his
gratitude
,
or
the
*NL*
desire
to
see
them
repeated
,
or
a
paroxysm
of
love
for
her
which
had
*NL*
need
of
some
such
outlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
other
times
,
grief
would
again
take
hold
of
him
;
he
would
imagine
*NL*
that
Odette
was
Forcheville
's
mistress
,
and
that
,
when
they
had
both
sat
*NL*
watching
him
from
the
depths
of
the
Verdurins
'
landau
,
in
the
Bois
,
on
*NL*
the
evening
before
the
party
at
Chatou
to
which
he
had
not
been
invited
,
*NL*
while
he
implored
her
in
vain
,
with
that
look
of
despair
on
his
face
*NL*
which
even
his
coachman
had
noticed
,
to
come
home
with
him
,
and
then
*NL*
turned
away
,
solitary
,
crushed
,
--
she
must
have
employed
,
to
draw
*NL*
Forcheville
's
attention
to
him
,
while
she
murmured
:
``
Do
look
at
him
,
*NL*
storming
!
''
the
same
glance
,
brilliant
,
malicious
,
sidelong
,
cunning
,
as
*NL*
on
the
evening
when
Forcheville
had
driven
Saniette
from
the
Verdurins
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
such
times
Swann
detested
her
.
``
But
I
've
been
a
fool
,
too
,
''
he
would
*NL*
argue
.
``
I
'm
paying
for
other
men
's
pleasures
with
my
money
.
All
the
*NL*
same
,
she
'd
better
take
care
,
and
not
pull
the
string
too
often
,
for
*NL*
I
might
very
well
stop
giving
her
anything
at
all
.
At
any
rate
,
we
'd
*NL*
better
knock
off
supplementary
favours
for
the
time
being
.
To
think
*NL*
that
,
only
yesterday
,
when
she
said
she
would
like
to
go
to
Bayreuth
*NL*
for
the
season
,
I
was
such
an
ass
as
to
offer
to
take
one
of
those
jolly
*NL*
little
places
the
King
of
Bavaria
has
there
,
for
the
two
of
us
.
However
*NL*
she
did
n't
seem
particularly
keen
;
she
has
n't
said
yes
or
no
yet
.
Let
's
*NL*
hope
that
she
'll
refuse
.
Good
God
!
Think
of
listening
to
Wagner
for
a
*NL*
fortnight
on
end
with
her
,
who
takes
about
as
much
interest
in
music
as
*NL*
a
fish
does
in
little
apples
;
it
will
be
fun
!
''
And
his
hatred
,
like
*NL*
his
love
,
needing
to
manifest
itself
in
action
,
he
amused
himself
with
*NL*
urging
his
evil
imaginings
further
and
further
,
because
,
thanks
to
the
*NL*
perfidies
with
which
he
charged
Odette
,
he
detested
her
still
more
,
and
*NL*
would
be
able
,
if
it
turned
out
--
as
he
tried
to
convince
himself
--
that
*NL*
she
was
indeed
guilty
of
them
,
to
take
the
opportunity
of
punishing
her
,
*NL*
emptying
upon
her
the
overflowing
vials
of
his
wrath
.
In
this
way
,
he
*NL*
went
so
far
as
to
suppose
that
he
was
going
to
receive
a
letter
from
*NL*
her
,
in
which
she
would
ask
him
for
money
to
take
the
house
at
Bayreuth
,
*NL*
but
with
the
warning
that
he
was
not
to
come
there
himself
,
as
she
had
*NL*
promised
Forcheville
and
the
Verdurins
to
invite
them
.
Oh
,
how
he
*NL*
would
have
loved
it
,
had
it
been
conceivable
that
she
would
have
*NL*
that
audacity
.
What
joy
he
would
have
in
refusing
,
in
drawing
up
that
*NL*
vindictive
reply
,
the
terms
of
which
he
amused
himself
by
selecting
and
*NL*
declaiming
aloud
,
as
though
he
had
actually
received
her
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
next
day
,
her
letter
came
.
She
wrote
that
the
Verdurins
and
*NL*
their
friends
had
expressed
a
desire
to
be
present
at
these
performances
*NL*
of
Wagner
,
and
that
,
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
send
her
the
money
,
*NL*
she
would
be
able
at
last
,
after
going
so
often
to
their
house
,
to
have
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
the
Verdurins
in
hers
.
Of
him
she
said
not
*NL*
a
word
;
it
was
to
be
taken
for
granted
that
their
presence
at
Bayreuth
*NL*
would
be
a
bar
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
that
annihilating
answer
,
every
word
of
which
he
had
carefully
*NL*
rehearsed
overnight
,
without
venturing
to
hope
that
it
could
ever
be
*NL*
used
,
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
having
it
conveyed
to
her
.
Alas
!
he
*NL*
felt
only
too
certain
that
with
the
money
which
she
had
,
or
could
easily
*NL*
procure
,
she
would
be
able
,
all
the
same
,
to
take
a
house
at
Bayreuth
,
*NL*
since
she
wished
to
do
so
,
she
who
was
incapable
of
distinguishing
*NL*
between
Bach
and
Clapisson
.
Let
her
take
it
,
then
;
she
would
have
to
*NL*
live
in
it
more
frugally
,
that
was
all
.
No
means
-LRB-
as
there
would
have
*NL*
been
if
he
had
replied
by
sending
her
several
thousand-franc
notes
-RRB-
of
*NL*
organising
,
each
evening
,
in
her
hired
castle
,
those
exquisite
little
*NL*
suppers
,
after
which
she
might
perhaps
be
seized
by
the
whim
-LRB-
which
,
*NL*
it
was
possible
,
had
never
yet
seized
her
-RRB-
of
falling
into
the
arms
of
*NL*
Forcheville
.
At
any
rate
,
this
loathsome
expedition
,
it
would
not
be
*NL*
Swann
who
had
to
pay
for
it
.
Ah
!
if
he
could
only
manage
to
prevent
*NL*
it
,
if
she
could
sprain
her
ankle
before
starting
,
if
the
driver
of
the
*NL*
carriage
which
was
to
take
her
to
the
station
would
consent
-LRB-
no
matter
*NL*
how
great
the
bribe
-RRB-
to
smuggle
her
to
some
place
where
she
could
be
*NL*
kept
for
a
time
in
seclusion
,
that
perfidious
woman
,
her
eyes
tinselled
*NL*
with
a
smile
of
complicity
for
Forcheville
,
which
was
what
Odette
had
*NL*
become
for
Swann
in
the
last
forty-eight
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
never
that
for
very
long
;
after
a
few
days
the
shining
,
*NL*
crafty
eyes
lost
their
brightness
and
their
duplicity
,
that
picture
of
*NL*
an
execrable
Odette
saying
to
Forcheville
:
``
Look
at
him
storming
!
''
began
*NL*
to
grow
pale
and
to
dissolve
.
Then
gradually
reappeared
and
rose
before
*NL*
him
,
softly
radiant
,
the
face
of
the
other
Odette
,
of
that
Odette
who
*NL*
also
turned
with
a
smile
to
Forcheville
,
but
with
a
smile
in
which
there
*NL*
was
nothing
but
affection
for
Swann
,
when
she
said
:
``
You
must
n't
stay
*NL*
long
,
for
this
gentleman
does
n't
much
like
my
having
visitors
when
he
's
*NL*
here
.
Oh
!
if
you
only
knew
the
creature
as
I
know
him
!
''
that
same
smile
*NL*
with
which
she
used
to
thank
Swann
for
some
instance
of
his
courtesy
*NL*
which
she
prized
so
highly
,
for
some
advice
for
which
she
had
asked
him
*NL*
in
one
of
those
grave
crises
in
her
life
,
when
she
could
turn
to
him
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
to
this
other
Odette
,
he
would
ask
himself
what
could
have
induced
*NL*
him
to
write
that
outrageous
letter
,
of
which
,
probably
,
until
then
,
*NL*
she
had
never
supposed
him
capable
,
a
letter
which
must
have
lowered
him
*NL*
from
the
high
,
from
the
supreme
place
which
,
by
his
generosity
,
by
his
*NL*
loyalty
,
he
had
won
for
himself
in
her
esteem
.
He
would
become
less
dear
*NL*
to
her
,
since
it
was
for
those
qualities
,
which
she
found
neither
in
*NL*
Forcheville
nor
in
any
other
,
that
she
loved
him
.
It
was
for
them
that
*NL*
Odette
so
often
shewed
him
a
reciprocal
kindness
,
which
counted
for
less
*NL*
than
nothing
in
his
moments
of
jealousy
,
because
it
was
not
a
sign
of
*NL*
reciprocal
desire
,
was
indeed
a
proof
rather
of
affection
than
of
love
,
*NL*
but
the
importance
of
which
he
began
once
more
to
feel
in
proportion
as
*NL*
the
spontaneous
relaxation
of
his
suspicions
,
often
accelerated
by
the
*NL*
distraction
brought
to
him
by
reading
about
art
or
by
the
conversation
*NL*
of
a
friend
,
rendered
his
passion
less
exacting
of
reciprocities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
,
after
this
swing
of
the
pendulum
,
Odette
had
naturally
*NL*
returned
to
the
place
from
which
Swann
's
jealousy
had
for
the
moment
*NL*
driven
her
,
in
the
angle
in
which
he
found
her
charming
,
he
pictured
her
*NL*
to
himself
as
full
of
tenderness
,
with
a
look
of
consent
in
her
eyes
,
*NL*
and
so
beautiful
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
moving
his
lips
towards
*NL*
her
,
as
though
she
had
actually
been
in
the
room
for
him
to
kiss
;
and
*NL*
he
preserved
a
sense
of
gratitude
to
her
for
that
bewitching
,
kindly
*NL*
glance
,
as
strong
as
though
she
had
really
looked
thus
at
him
,
and
it
*NL*
had
not
been
merely
his
imagination
that
had
portrayed
it
in
order
to
*NL*
satisfy
his
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
distress
he
must
have
caused
her
!
Certainly
he
found
adequate
*NL*
reasons
for
his
resentment
,
but
they
would
not
have
been
sufficient
to
*NL*
make
him
feel
that
resentment
,
if
he
had
not
so
passionately
loved
her
.
*NL*
Had
he
not
nourished
grievances
,
just
as
serious
,
against
other
women
,
*NL*
to
whom
he
would
,
none
the
less
,
render
willing
service
to-day
,
feeling
*NL*
no
anger
towards
them
because
he
no
longer
loved
them
?
If
the
day
ever
*NL*
came
when
he
would
find
himself
in
the
same
state
of
indifference
with
*NL*
regard
to
Odette
,
he
would
then
understand
that
it
was
his
jealousy
*NL*
alone
which
had
led
him
to
find
something
atrocious
,
unpardonable
,
in
*NL*
this
desire
-LRB-
after
all
,
so
natural
a
desire
,
springing
from
a
childlike
*NL*
ingenuousness
and
also
from
a
certain
delicacy
in
her
nature
-RRB-
to
be
*NL*
able
,
in
her
turn
,
when
an
occasion
offered
,
to
repay
the
Verdurins
for
*NL*
their
hospitality
,
and
to
play
the
hostess
in
a
house
of
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
the
other
point
of
view
--
opposite
to
that
of
his
love
*NL*
and
of
his
jealousy
,
to
which
he
resorted
at
times
by
a
sort
of
mental
*NL*
equity
,
and
in
order
to
make
allowance
for
different
eventualities
--
from
*NL*
which
he
tried
to
form
a
fresh
judgment
of
Odette
,
based
on
the
*NL*
supposition
that
he
had
never
been
in
love
with
her
,
that
she
was
to
him
*NL*
just
a
woman
like
other
women
,
that
her
life
had
not
been
-LRB-
whenever
he
*NL*
himself
was
not
present
-RRB-
different
,
a
texture
woven
in
secret
apart
from
*NL*
him
,
and
warped
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wherefore
believe
that
she
would
enjoy
down
there
with
Forcheville
or
*NL*
with
other
men
intoxicating
pleasures
which
she
had
never
known
with
*NL*
him
,
and
which
his
jealousy
alone
had
fabricated
in
all
their
elements
?
*NL*
At
Bayreuth
,
as
in
Paris
,
if
it
should
happen
that
Forcheville
thought
*NL*
of
him
at
all
,
it
would
only
be
as
of
some
one
who
counted
for
a
great
*NL*
deal
in
the
life
of
Odette
,
some
one
for
whom
he
was
obliged
to
make
*NL*
way
,
when
they
met
in
her
house
.
If
Forcheville
and
she
scored
a
*NL*
triumph
by
being
down
there
together
in
spite
of
him
,
it
was
he
who
had
*NL*
engineered
that
triumph
by
striving
in
vain
to
prevent
her
from
going
*NL*
there
,
whereas
if
he
had
approved
of
her
plan
,
which
for
that
matter
was
*NL*
quite
defensible
,
she
would
have
had
the
appearance
of
being
there
by
*NL*
his
counsel
,
she
would
have
felt
herself
sent
there
,
housed
there
by
*NL*
him
,
and
for
the
pleasure
which
she
derived
from
entertaining
those
*NL*
people
who
had
so
often
entertained
her
,
it
was
to
him
that
she
would
*NL*
have
had
to
acknowledge
her
indebtedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
--
instead
of
letting
her
go
off
thus
,
at
cross-purposes
with
him
,
*NL*
without
having
seen
him
again
--
he
were
to
send
her
this
money
,
if
he
*NL*
were
to
encourage
her
to
take
this
journey
,
and
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
*NL*
make
it
comfortable
and
pleasant
for
her
,
she
would
come
running
to
him
,
*NL*
happy
,
grateful
,
and
he
would
have
the
joy
--
the
sight
of
her
face
--
which
*NL*
he
had
not
known
for
nearly
a
week
,
a
joy
which
none
other
could
*NL*
replace
.
For
the
moment
that
Swann
was
able
to
form
a
picture
of
her
*NL*
without
revulsion
,
that
he
could
see
once
again
the
friendliness
in
*NL*
her
smile
,
and
that
the
desire
to
tear
her
away
from
every
rival
was
*NL*
no
longer
imposed
by
his
jealousy
upon
his
love
,
that
love
once
again
*NL*
became
,
more
than
anything
,
a
taste
for
the
sensations
which
Odette
's
*NL*
person
gave
him
,
for
the
pleasure
which
he
found
in
admiring
,
as
one
*NL*
might
a
spectacle
,
or
in
questioning
,
as
one
might
a
phenomenon
,
the
*NL*
birth
of
one
of
her
glances
,
the
formation
of
one
of
her
smiles
,
the
*NL*
utterance
of
an
intonation
of
her
voice
.
And
this
pleasure
,
different
*NL*
from
every
other
,
had
in
the
end
created
in
him
a
need
of
her
,
which
*NL*
she
alone
,
by
her
presence
or
by
her
letters
,
could
assuage
,
almost
as
*NL*
disinterested
,
almost
as
artistic
,
as
perverse
as
another
need
which
*NL*
characterised
this
new
period
in
Swann
's
life
,
when
the
sereness
,
*NL*
the
depression
of
the
preceding
years
had
been
followed
by
a
sort
of
*NL*
spiritual
superabundance
,
without
his
knowing
to
what
he
owed
this
*NL*
unlooked-for
enrichment
of
his
life
,
any
more
than
a
person
in
delicate
*NL*
health
who
from
a
certain
moment
grows
stronger
,
puts
on
flesh
,
and
*NL*
seems
for
a
time
to
be
on
the
road
to
a
complete
recovery
:
--
this
*NL*
other
need
,
which
,
too
,
developed
in
him
independently
of
the
visible
,
*NL*
material
world
,
was
the
need
to
listen
to
music
and
to
learn
to
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
by
the
chemical
process
of
his
malady
,
after
he
had
created
*NL*
jealousy
out
of
his
love
,
he
began
again
to
generate
tenderness
,
pity
*NL*
for
Odette
.
She
had
become
once
more
the
old
Odette
,
charming
and
kind
.
*NL*
He
was
full
of
remorse
for
having
treated
her
harshly
.
He
wished
her
to
*NL*
come
to
him
,
and
,
before
she
came
,
he
wished
to
have
already
procured
*NL*
for
her
some
pleasure
,
so
as
to
watch
her
gratitude
taking
shape
in
her
*NL*
face
and
moulding
her
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
too
,
Odette
,
certain
of
seeing
him
come
to
her
in
a
few
days
,
*NL*
as
tender
and
submissive
as
before
,
and
plead
with
her
for
a
*NL*
reconciliation
,
became
inured
,
was
no
longer
afraid
of
displeasing
him
,
*NL*
or
even
of
making
him
angry
,
and
refused
him
,
whenever
it
suited
her
,
*NL*
the
favours
by
which
he
set
most
store
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
she
did
not
realise
how
sincere
he
had
been
with
her
during
*NL*
their
quarrel
,
when
he
had
told
her
that
he
would
not
send
her
any
*NL*
money
,
but
would
do
what
he
could
to
hurt
her
.
Perhaps
she
did
not
*NL*
realise
,
either
,
how
sincere
he
still
was
,
if
not
with
her
,
at
any
rate
*NL*
with
himself
,
on
other
occasions
when
,
for
the
sake
of
their
future
*NL*
relations
,
to
shew
Odette
that
he
was
capable
of
doing
without
her
,
that
*NL*
a
rupture
was
still
possible
between
them
,
he
decided
to
wait
some
time
*NL*
before
going
to
see
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
several
days
had
elapsed
,
during
which
she
had
caused
him
no
*NL*
fresh
anxiety
;
and
as
,
from
the
next
few
visits
which
he
would
pay
her
,
*NL*
he
knew
that
he
was
likely
to
derive
not
any
great
pleasure
,
but
,
more
*NL*
probably
,
some
annoyance
which
would
put
an
end
to
the
state
of
calm
in
*NL*
which
he
found
himself
,
he
wrote
to
her
that
he
was
very
busy
,
and
*NL*
would
not
be
able
to
see
her
on
any
of
the
days
that
he
had
suggested
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
a
letter
from
her
,
crossing
his
,
asked
him
to
postpone
one
of
*NL*
those
very
meetings
.
He
asked
himself
,
why
;
his
suspicions
,
his
grief
,
*NL*
again
took
hold
of
him
.
He
could
no
longer
abide
,
in
the
new
state
of
*NL*
agitation
into
which
he
found
himself
plunged
,
by
the
arrangements
which
*NL*
he
had
made
in
his
preceding
state
of
comparative
calm
;
he
would
run
*NL*
to
find
her
,
and
would
insist
upon
seeing
her
on
each
of
the
following
*NL*
days
.
And
even
if
she
had
not
written
first
,
if
she
merely
acknowledged
*NL*
his
letter
,
it
was
enough
to
make
him
unable
to
rest
without
seeing
*NL*
her
.
For
,
upsetting
all
Swann
's
calculations
,
Odette
's
acceptance
had
*NL*
entirely
changed
his
attitude
.
Like
everyone
who
possesses
something
*NL*
precious
,
so
as
to
know
what
would
happen
if
he
ceased
for
a
moment
to
*NL*
possess
it
,
he
had
detached
the
precious
object
from
his
mind
,
leaving
,
*NL*
as
he
thought
,
everything
else
in
the
same
state
as
when
it
was
there
.
*NL*
But
the
absence
of
one
part
from
a
whole
is
not
only
that
,
it
is
not
*NL*
simply
a
partial
omission
,
it
is
a
disturbance
of
all
the
other
parts
,
a
*NL*
new
state
which
it
was
impossible
to
foresee
from
the
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
other
times
--
when
Odette
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
for
a
*NL*
holiday
--
it
was
after
some
trifling
quarrel
for
which
he
had
chosen
the
*NL*
pretext
,
that
he
decided
not
to
write
to
her
and
not
to
see
her
until
*NL*
her
return
,
giving
the
appearance
-LRB-
and
expecting
the
reward
-RRB-
of
*NL*
a
serious
rupture
,
which
she
would
perhaps
regard
as
final
,
to
a
*NL*
separation
,
the
greater
part
of
which
was
inevitable
,
since
she
was
*NL*
going
away
,
which
,
in
fact
,
he
was
merely
allowing
to
start
a
little
*NL*
sooner
than
it
must
.
At
once
he
could
imagine
Odette
,
puzzled
,
anxious
,
*NL*
distressed
at
having
received
neither
visit
nor
letter
from
him
and
this
*NL*
picture
of
her
,
by
calming
his
jealousy
,
made
it
easy
for
him
to
break
*NL*
himself
of
the
habit
of
seeing
her
.
At
odd
moments
,
no
doubt
,
in
the
*NL*
furthest
recesses
of
his
brain
,
where
his
determination
had
thrust
*NL*
it
away
,
and
thanks
to
the
length
of
the
interval
,
the
three
weeks
'
*NL*
separation
to
which
he
had
agreed
,
it
was
with
pleasure
that
he
would
*NL*
consider
the
idea
that
he
would
see
Odette
again
on
her
return
;
but
it
*NL*
was
also
with
so
little
impatience
that
he
began
to
ask
himself
whether
*NL*
he
would
not
readily
consent
to
the
doubling
of
the
period
of
so
easy
an
*NL*
abstinence
.
It
had
lasted
,
so
far
,
but
three
days
,
a
much
shorter
time
*NL*
than
he
had
often
,
before
,
passed
without
seeing
Odette
,
and
without
*NL*
having
,
as
on
this
occasion
he
had
,
premeditated
a
separation
.
And
*NL*
yet
,
there
and
then
,
some
tiny
trace
of
contrariety
in
his
mind
,
or
*NL*
of
weakness
in
his
body
,
--
by
inciting
him
to
regard
the
present
as
an
*NL*
exceptional
moment
,
one
not
to
be
governed
by
the
rules
,
one
in
which
*NL*
prudence
itself
would
allow
him
to
take
advantage
of
the
soothing
*NL*
effects
of
a
pleasure
and
to
give
his
will
-LRB-
until
the
time
should
come
*NL*
when
its
efforts
might
serve
any
purpose
-RRB-
a
holiday
--
suspended
the
*NL*
action
of
his
will
,
which
ceased
to
exert
its
inhibitive
control
;
or
,
*NL*
without
that
even
,
the
thought
of
some
information
for
which
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
to
ask
Odette
,
such
as
if
she
had
decided
in
what
colour
she
*NL*
would
have
her
carriage
repainted
,
or
,
with
regard
to
some
investment
,
*NL*
whether
they
were
`
ordinary
'
or
`
preference
'
shares
that
she
wished
him
*NL*
to
buy
-LRB-
for
it
was
all
very
well
to
shew
her
that
he
could
live
without
*NL*
seeing
her
,
but
if
,
after
that
,
the
carriage
had
to
be
painted
over
*NL*
again
,
if
the
shares
produced
no
dividend
,
a
fine
lot
of
good
he
would
*NL*
have
done
-RRB-
,
--
and
suddenly
,
like
a
stretched
piece
of
elastic
which
is
*NL*
let
go
,
or
the
air
in
a
pneumatic
machine
which
is
ripped
open
,
the
idea
*NL*
of
seeing
her
again
,
from
the
remote
point
in
time
to
which
it
had
been
*NL*
attached
,
sprang
back
into
the
field
of
the
present
and
of
immediate
*NL*
possibilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sprang
back
thus
without
meeting
any
further
resistance
,
so
*NL*
irresistible
,
in
fact
,
that
Swann
had
been
far
less
unhappy
in
watching
*NL*
the
end
gradually
approaching
,
day
by
day
,
of
the
fortnight
which
he
*NL*
must
spend
apart
from
Odette
,
than
he
was
when
kept
waiting
ten
minutes
*NL*
while
his
coachman
brought
round
the
carriage
which
was
to
take
him
to
*NL*
her
,
minutes
which
he
passed
in
transports
of
impatience
and
joy
,
in
*NL*
which
he
recaptured
a
thousand
times
over
,
to
lavish
on
it
all
the
*NL*
wealth
of
his
affection
,
that
idea
of
his
meeting
with
Odette
,
which
,
by
*NL*
so
abrupt
a
repercussion
,
at
a
moment
when
he
supposed
it
so
remote
,
was
*NL*
once
more
present
and
on
the
very
surface
of
his
consciousness
.
The
fact
*NL*
was
that
this
idea
no
longer
found
,
as
an
obstacle
in
its
course
,
the
*NL*
desire
to
contrive
without
further
delay
to
resist
its
coming
,
which
*NL*
had
ceased
to
have
any
place
in
Swann
's
mind
since
,
having
proved
to
*NL*
himself
--
or
so
,
at
least
,
he
believed
--
that
he
was
so
easily
capable
of
*NL*
resisting
it
,
he
no
longer
saw
any
inconvenience
in
postponing
a
plan
of
*NL*
separation
which
he
was
now
certain
of
being
able
to
put
into
operation
*NL*
whenever
he
would
.
Furthermore
,
this
idea
of
seeing
her
again
came
back
*NL*
to
him
adorned
with
a
novelty
,
a
seductiveness
,
armed
with
a
virulence
,
*NL*
all
of
which
long
habit
had
enfeebled
,
but
which
had
acquired
new
vigour
*NL*
during
this
privation
,
not
of
three
days
but
of
a
fortnight
-LRB-
for
a
*NL*
period
of
abstinence
may
be
calculated
,
by
anticipation
,
as
having
*NL*
lasted
already
until
the
final
date
assigned
to
it
-RRB-
,
and
had
converted
*NL*
what
had
been
,
until
then
,
a
pleasure
in
store
,
which
could
easily
be
*NL*
sacrificed
,
into
an
unlooked-for
happiness
which
he
was
powerless
to
*NL*
resist
.
Finally
,
the
idea
returned
to
him
with
its
beauty
enhanced
by
*NL*
his
own
ignorance
of
what
Odette
might
have
thought
,
might
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
have
done
on
finding
that
he
shewed
no
sign
of
life
,
with
the
result
*NL*
that
he
was
going
now
to
meet
with
the
entrancing
revelation
of
an
*NL*
Odette
almost
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
,
just
as
she
had
supposed
that
his
refusal
to
send
her
money
was
*NL*
only
a
feint
,
saw
nothing
but
a
pretext
in
the
question
which
he
came
,
*NL*
now
,
to
ask
her
,
about
the
repainting
of
her
carriage
,
or
the
purchase
*NL*
of
stock
.
For
she
could
not
reconstruct
the
several
phases
of
these
*NL*
crises
through
which
he
passed
,
and
in
the
general
idea
which
she
formed
*NL*
of
them
she
made
no
attempt
to
understand
their
mechanism
,
looking
only
*NL*
to
what
she
knew
beforehand
,
their
necessary
,
never-failing
and
always
*NL*
identical
termination
.
An
imperfect
idea
-LRB-
though
possibly
all
the
more
*NL*
profound
in
consequence
-RRB-
,
if
one
were
to
judge
it
from
the
point
of
*NL*
view
of
Swann
,
who
would
doubtless
have
considered
that
Odette
failed
*NL*
to
understand
him
,
just
as
a
morphinomaniac
or
a
consumptive
,
each
*NL*
persuaded
that
he
has
been
thrown
back
,
one
by
some
outside
event
,
*NL*
at
the
moment
when
he
was
just
going
to
shake
himself
free
from
his
*NL*
inveterate
habit
,
the
other
by
an
accidental
indisposition
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
was
just
going
to
be
finally
cured
,
feels
himself
to
be
*NL*
misunderstood
by
the
doctor
who
does
not
attach
the
same
importance
*NL*
to
these
pretended
contingencies
,
mere
disguises
,
according
to
him
,
*NL*
assumed
,
so
as
to
be
perceptible
by
his
patients
,
by
the
vice
of
one
*NL*
and
the
morbid
state
of
the
other
,
which
in
reality
have
never
ceased
*NL*
to
weigh
heavily
and
incurably
upon
them
while
they
were
nursing
their
*NL*
dreams
of
normality
and
health
.
And
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
Swann
's
*NL*
love
had
reached
that
stage
at
which
the
physician
and
-LRB-
in
the
case
of
*NL*
certain
affections
-RRB-
the
boldest
of
surgeons
ask
themselves
whether
*NL*
to
deprive
a
patient
of
his
vice
or
to
rid
him
of
his
malady
is
still
*NL*
reasonable
,
or
indeed
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
,
of
the
extent
of
this
love
Swann
had
no
direct
knowledge
.
*NL*
When
he
sought
to
measure
it
,
it
happened
sometimes
that
he
found
it
*NL*
diminished
,
shrunken
almost
to
nothing
;
for
instance
,
the
very
moderate
*NL*
liking
,
amounting
almost
to
dislike
,
which
,
in
the
days
before
he
was
*NL*
in
love
with
Odette
,
he
had
felt
for
her
expressive
features
,
her
faded
*NL*
complexion
,
returned
on
certain
days
.
``
Really
,
I
am
making
distinct
*NL*
headway
,
''
he
would
tell
himself
on
the
morrow
,
``
when
I
come
to
think
it
*NL*
over
carefully
,
I
find
out
that
I
got
hardly
any
pleasure
,
last
night
,
*NL*
out
of
being
in
bed
with
her
;
it
's
an
odd
thing
,
but
I
actually
thought
*NL*
her
ugly
.
''
And
certainly
he
was
sincere
,
but
his
love
extended
a
long
*NL*
way
beyond
the
province
of
physical
desire
.
Odette
's
person
,
indeed
,
*NL*
no
longer
held
any
great
place
in
it
.
When
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
*NL*
photograph
of
Odette
on
his
table
,
or
when
she
came
to
see
him
,
he
*NL*
had
difficulty
in
identifying
her
face
,
either
in
the
flesh
or
on
the
*NL*
pasteboard
,
with
the
painful
and
continuous
anxiety
which
dwelt
in
his
*NL*
mind
.
He
would
say
to
himself
,
almost
with
astonishment
,
``
It
is
she
!
''
as
*NL*
when
suddenly
some
one
shews
us
in
a
detached
,
externalised
form
one
*NL*
of
our
own
maladies
,
and
we
find
in
it
no
resemblance
to
what
we
are
*NL*
suffering
.
``
She
?
''
--
he
tried
to
ask
himself
what
that
meant
;
for
it
*NL*
is
something
like
love
,
like
death
-LRB-
rather
than
like
those
vague
*NL*
conceptions
of
maladies
-RRB-
,
a
thing
which
one
repeatedly
calls
in
*NL*
question
,
in
order
to
make
oneself
probe
further
into
it
,
in
the
fear
*NL*
that
the
question
will
find
no
answer
,
that
the
substance
will
escape
*NL*
our
grasp
--
the
mystery
of
personality
.
And
this
malady
,
which
was
*NL*
Swann
's
love
,
had
so
far
multiplied
,
was
so
closely
interwoven
with
all
*NL*
his
habits
,
with
all
his
actions
,
with
his
thoughts
,
his
health
,
his
*NL*
sleep
,
his
life
,
even
with
what
he
hoped
for
after
his
death
,
was
so
*NL*
entirely
one
with
him
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
wrest
it
*NL*
away
without
almost
entirely
destroying
him
;
as
surgeons
say
,
his
case
*NL*
was
past
operation
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
love
Swann
had
been
so
far
detached
from
all
other
interests
*NL*
that
when
by
chance
he
reappeared
in
the
world
of
fashion
,
reminding
*NL*
himself
that
his
social
relations
,
like
a
beautifully
wrought
setting
*NL*
-LRB-
although
she
would
not
have
been
able
to
form
any
very
exact
estimate
*NL*
of
its
worth
-RRB-
,
might
,
still
,
add
a
little
to
his
own
value
in
Odette
's
*NL*
eyes
-LRB-
as
indeed
they
might
have
done
had
they
not
been
cheapened
by
his
*NL*
love
itself
,
which
for
Odette
depreciated
everything
that
it
touched
by
*NL*
seeming
to
denounce
such
things
as
less
precious
than
itself
-RRB-
,
he
would
*NL*
feel
there
,
simultaneously
with
his
distress
at
being
in
places
and
*NL*
among
people
that
she
did
not
know
,
the
same
detached
sense
of
pleasure
*NL*
as
he
would
have
derived
from
a
novel
or
a
painting
in
which
were
*NL*
depicted
the
amusements
of
a
leisured
class
;
just
as
,
at
home
,
he
used
*NL*
to
enjoy
the
thought
of
the
smooth
efficiency
of
his
household
,
the
*NL*
smartness
of
his
own
wardrobe
and
of
his
servants
'
liveries
,
the
*NL*
soundness
of
his
investments
,
with
the
same
relish
as
when
he
read
in
*NL*
Saint-Simon
,
who
was
one
of
his
favourite
authors
,
of
the
machinery
of
*NL*
daily
life
at
Versailles
,
what
Mme.
de
Maintenon
ate
and
drank
,
or
the
*NL*
shrewd
avarice
and
great
pomp
of
Lulli
.
And
in
the
small
extent
to
which
*NL*
this
detachment
was
not
absolute
,
the
reason
for
this
new
pleasure
which
*NL*
Swann
was
tasting
was
that
he
could
emigrate
for
a
moment
into
those
few
*NL*
and
distant
parts
of
himself
which
had
remained
almost
foreign
to
his
*NL*
love
and
to
his
pain
.
In
this
respect
the
personality
,
with
which
my
*NL*
great-aunt
endowed
him
,
of
`
young
Swann
,
'
as
distinct
from
the
more
*NL*
individual
personality
of
Charles
Swann
,
was
that
in
which
he
now
most
*NL*
delighted
.
Once
when
,
because
it
was
the
birthday
of
the
Princesse
de
*NL*
Parme
-LRB-
and
because
she
could
often
be
of
use
,
indirectly
,
to
Odette
,
*NL*
by
letting
her
have
seats
for
galas
and
jubilees
and
all
that
sort
of
*NL*
thing
-RRB-
,
he
had
decided
to
send
her
a
basket
of
fruit
,
and
was
not
quite
*NL*
sure
where
or
how
to
order
it
,
he
had
entrusted
the
task
to
a
cousin
of
*NL*
his
mother
who
,
delighted
to
be
doing
a
commission
for
him
,
had
written
*NL*
to
him
,
laying
stress
on
the
fact
that
she
had
not
chosen
all
the
fruit
*NL*
at
the
same
place
,
but
the
grapes
from
Crapote
,
whose
speciality
they
*NL*
were
,
the
straw
berries
from
Jauret
,
the
pears
from
Chevet
,
who
always
*NL*
had
the
best
,
am
soon
,
``
every
fruit
visited
and
examined
,
one
by
one
,
*NL*
by
myself
.
''
And
in
the
sequel
,
by
the
cordiality
with
which
the
*NL*
Princess
thanked
him
,
he
had
been
able
to
judge
of
the
flavour
of
the
*NL*
strawberries
and
of
the
ripeness
of
the
pears
.
But
,
most
of
all
,
that
*NL*
``
every
fruit
visited
and
examined
one
by
one
,
by
myself
''
had
brought
*NL*
balm
to
his
sufferings
by
carrying
his
mind
off
to
a
region
which
he
*NL*
rarely
visited
,
although
it
was
his
by
right
,
as
the
heir
of
a
rich
*NL*
and
respectable
middle-class
family
in
which
had
been
handed
down
from
*NL*
generation
to
generation
the
knowledge
of
the
`
right
places
'
and
the
art
*NL*
of
ordering
things
from
shops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
truth
,
he
had
too
long
forgotten
that
he
was
`
young
Swann
'
not
to
*NL*
feel
,
when
he
assumed
that
part
again
for
a
moment
,
a
keener
pleasure
*NL*
than
he
was
capable
of
feeling
at
other
times
--
when
,
indeed
,
he
was
*NL*
grown
sick
of
pleasure
;
and
if
the
friendliness
of
the
middle-class
*NL*
people
,
for
whom
he
had
never
been
anything
else
than
`
young
Swann
,
'
was
*NL*
less
animated
than
that
of
the
aristocrats
-LRB-
though
more
flattering
,
for
*NL*
all
that
,
since
in
the
middle-class
mind
friendship
is
inseparable
from
*NL*
respect
-RRB-
,
no
letter
from
a
Royal
Personage
,
offering
him
some
princely
*NL*
entertainment
,
could
ever
be
so
attractive
to
Swann
as
the
letter
which
*NL*
asked
him
to
be
a
witness
,
or
merely
to
be
present
at
a
wedding
in
the
*NL*
family
of
some
old
friends
of
his
parents
;
some
of
whom
had
`
kept
up
'
*NL*
with
him
,
like
my
grandfather
,
who
,
the
year
before
these
events
,
had
*NL*
invited
him
to
my
mother
's
wedding
,
while
others
barely
knew
him
by
*NL*
sight
,
but
were
,
they
thought
,
in
duty
bound
to
shew
civility
to
the
*NL*
son
,
to
the
worthy
successor
of
the
late
M.
Swann
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
by
virtue
of
his
intimacy
,
already
time-honoured
,
with
so
many
of
*NL*
them
,
the
people
of
fashion
,
in
a
certain
sense
,
were
also
a
part
of
his
*NL*
house
,
his
service
,
and
his
family
.
He
felt
,
when
his
mind
dwelt
upon
*NL*
his
brilliant
connections
,
the
same
external
support
,
the
same
solid
*NL*
comfort
as
when
he
looked
at
the
fine
estate
,
the
fine
silver
,
the
*NL*
fine
table-linen
which
had
come
down
to
him
from
his
forebears
.
And
the
*NL*
thought
that
,
if
he
were
seized
by
a
sudden
illness
and
confined
to
the
*NL*
house
,
the
people
whom
his
valet
would
instinctively
run
to
find
would
*NL*
be
the
Duc
de
Chartres
,
the
Prince
de
Reuss
,
the
Duc
de
Luxembourg
*NL*
and
the
Baron
de
Charlus
,
brought
him
the
same
consolation
as
our
old
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
derived
from
the
knowledge
that
she
would
,
one
day
,
be
buried
*NL*
in
her
own
fine
clothes
,
marked
with
her
name
,
not
darned
at
all
-LRB-
or
so
*NL*
exquisitely
darned
that
it
merely
enhanced
one
's
idea
of
the
skill
and
*NL*
patience
of
the
seamstress
-RRB-
,
a
shroud
from
the
constant
image
of
which
*NL*
in
her
mind
's
eye
she
drew
a
certain
satisfactory
sense
,
if
not
actually
*NL*
of
wealth
and
prosperity
,
at
any
rate
of
self-esteem
.
But
most
of
*NL*
all
,
--
since
in
every
one
of
his
actions
and
thoughts
which
had
reference
*NL*
to
Odette
,
Swann
was
constantly
subdued
and
swayed
by
the
unconfessed
*NL*
feeling
that
he
was
,
perhaps
not
less
dear
,
but
at
least
less
welcome
*NL*
to
her
than
anyone
,
even
the
most
wearisome
of
the
Verdurins
'
*NL*
`
faithful
,
'
--
when
he
betook
himself
to
a
world
in
which
he
was
the
*NL*
paramount
example
of
taste
,
a
man
whom
no
pains
were
spared
to
attract
,
*NL*
whom
people
were
genuinely
sorry
not
to
see
,
he
began
once
again
to
*NL*
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
happier
life
,
almost
to
feel
an
appetite
*NL*
for
it
,
as
an
invalid
may
feel
who
has
been
in
bed
for
months
and
on
a
*NL*
strict
diet
,
when
he
picks
up
a
newspaper
and
reads
the
account
of
an
*NL*
official
banquet
or
the
advertisement
of
a
cruise
round
Sicily
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
was
obliged
to
make
excuses
to
his
fashionable
friends
for
not
*NL*
paying
them
visits
,
it
was
precisely
for
the
visits
that
he
did
pay
her
*NL*
that
he
sought
to
excuse
himself
to
Odette
.
He
still
paid
them
-LRB-
asking
*NL*
himself
at
the
end
of
each
month
whether
,
seeing
that
he
had
perhaps
*NL*
exhausted
her
patience
,
and
had
certainly
gone
rather
often
to
see
her
,
*NL*
it
would
be
enough
if
he
sent
her
four
thousand
francs
-RRB-
,
and
for
each
*NL*
visit
he
found
a
pretext
,
a
present
that
he
had
to
bring
her
,
some
*NL*
information
which
she
required
,
M.
de
Charlus
,
whom
he
had
met
actually
*NL*
going
to
her
house
,
and
who
had
insisted
upon
Swann
's
accompanying
him
.
*NL*
And
,
failing
any
excuse
,
he
would
beg
M.
de
Charlus
to
go
to
her
*NL*
at
once
,
and
to
tell
her
,
as
though
spontaneously
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
conversation
,
that
he
had
just
remembered
something
that
he
had
to
say
*NL*
to
Swann
,
and
would
she
please
send
a
message
to
Swann
's
house
asking
*NL*
him
to
come
to
her
then
and
there
;
but
as
a
rule
Swann
waited
at
home
*NL*
in
vain
,
and
M.
de
Charlus
informed
him
,
later
in
the
evening
,
that
his
*NL*
device
had
not
proved
successful
.
With
the
result
that
,
if
she
was
now
*NL*
frequently
away
from
Paris
,
even
when
she
was
there
he
scarcely
saw
her
;
*NL*
that
she
who
,
when
she
was
in
love
with
him
,
used
to
say
,
``
I
am
always
*NL*
free
''
and
``
What
can
it
matter
to
me
,
what
other
people
think
?
''
now
,
*NL*
whenever
he
wanted
to
see
her
,
appealed
to
the
proprieties
or
pleaded
*NL*
some
engagement
.
When
he
spoke
of
going
to
a
charity
entertainment
,
or
a
*NL*
private
view
,
or
a
first-night
at
which
she
was
to
be
present
,
she
would
*NL*
expostulate
that
he
wished
to
advertise
their
relations
in
public
,
that
*NL*
he
was
treating
her
like
a
woman
off
the
streets
.
Things
came
to
such
a
*NL*
pitch
that
,
in
an
effort
to
save
himself
from
being
altogether
forbidden
*NL*
to
meet
her
anywhere
,
Swann
,
remembering
that
she
knew
and
was
deeply
*NL*
attached
to
my
great-uncle
Adolphe
,
whose
friend
he
himself
also
*NL*
had
been
,
went
one
day
to
see
him
in
his
little
flat
in
the
Rue
*NL*
de
Bellechasse
,
to
ask
him
to
use
his
influence
with
Odette
.
As
it
*NL*
happened
,
she
invariably
adopted
,
when
she
spoke
to
Swann
about
my
*NL*
uncle
,
a
poetical
tone
,
saying
:
``
Ah
,
he
!
He
is
not
in
the
least
*NL*
like
you
;
it
is
an
exquisite
thing
,
a
great
,
a
beautiful
thing
,
his
*NL*
friendship
for
me
.
He
's
not
the
sort
of
man
who
would
have
so
little
*NL*
consideration
for
me
as
to
let
himself
be
seen
with
me
everywhere
in
*NL*
public
.
''
This
was
embarrassing
for
Swann
,
who
did
not
know
quite
to
what
*NL*
rhetorical
pitch
he
should
screw
himself
up
in
speaking
of
Odette
to
my
*NL*
uncle
.
He
began
by
alluding
to
her
excellence
,
_
a
priori
_
,
the
axiom
*NL*
of
her
seraphic
super-humanity
,
the
revelation
of
her
inexpressible
*NL*
virtues
,
no
conception
of
which
could
possibly
be
formed
.
``
I
should
*NL*
like
to
speak
to
you
about
her
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
you
,
who
know
what
a
woman
*NL*
supreme
above
all
women
,
what
an
adorable
being
,
what
an
angel
Odette
*NL*
is
.
But
you
know
,
also
,
what
life
is
in
Paris
.
Everyone
does
n't
see
*NL*
Odette
in
the
light
in
which
you
and
I
have
been
Privileged
to
see
her
.
*NL*
And
so
there
are
people
who
think
that
I
am
behaving
rather
foolishly
;
*NL*
she
wo
n't
even
allow
me
to
meet
her
out
of
doors
,
at
the
theatre
.
Now
*NL*
you
,
in
whom
she
has
such
enormous
confidence
,
could
n't
you
say
a
few
*NL*
words
for
me
to
her
,
just
to
assure
her
that
she
exaggerate
the
harm
*NL*
which
my
bowing
to
her
in
the
street
might
do
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
advised
Swann
not
to
see
Odette
for
some
days
,
after
which
she
*NL*
would
love
him
all
the
more
;
he
advised
Odette
to
let
Swann
meet
her
*NL*
everywhere
,
and
as
often
as
he
pleased
.
A
few
days
later
Odette
told
*NL*
Swann
that
she
had
just
had
a
rude
awakening
;
she
had
discovered
that
*NL*
my
uncle
was
the
same
as
other
men
;
he
had
tried
to
take
her
by
assault
.
*NL*
She
calmed
Swann
,
who
,
at
first
,
was
for
rushing
out
to
challenge
my
*NL*
uncle
to
a
duel
,
but
he
refused
to
shake
hands
with
him
when
they
met
*NL*
again
.
He
regretted
this
rupture
all
the
more
because
he
had
hoped
,
if
*NL*
he
had
met
my
uncle
Adolphe
again
sometimes
and
had
contrived
to
talk
*NL*
things
over
with
him
in
strict
confidence
,
to
be
able
to
get
him
to
*NL*
throw
a
light
on
certain
rumours
with
regard
to
the
life
that
Odette
had
*NL*
led
,
in
the
old
days
,
at
Nice
.
For
my
uncle
Adolphe
used
to
spend
the
*NL*
winter
there
,
and
Swann
thought
that
it
might
indeed
have
been
there
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
that
he
had
first
known
Odette
.
The
few
words
which
some
one
*NL*
had
let
fall
,
in
his
hearing
,
about
a
man
who
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
*NL*
Odette
's
lover
,
had
left
Swann
dumbfounded
.
But
the
very
things
which
he
*NL*
would
,
before
knowing
them
,
have
regarded
as
the
most
terrible
to
*NL*
learn
and
the
most
impossible
to
believe
,
were
,
once
he
knew
them
,
*NL*
incorporated
for
all
time
in
the
general
mass
of
his
sorrow
;
he
admitted
*NL*
them
,
he
could
no
longer
have
understood
their
not
existing
.
Only
,
*NL*
each
one
of
them
in
its
passage
traced
an
indelible
line
,
altering
the
*NL*
picture
that
he
had
formed
of
his
mistress
.
At
one
time
indeed
he
felt
*NL*
that
he
could
understand
that
this
moral
`
lightness
,
'
of
which
he
would
*NL*
never
have
suspected
Odette
,
was
perfectly
well
known
,
and
that
at
Baden
*NL*
or
Nice
,
when
she
had
gone
,
in
the
past
,
to
spend
several
months
in
*NL*
one
or
the
other
place
,
she
had
enjoyed
a
sort
of
amorous
notoriety
.
*NL*
He
attempted
,
in
order
to
question
them
,
to
get
into
touch
again
with
*NL*
certain
men
of
that
stamp
;
but
these
were
aware
that
he
knew
Odette
,
*NL*
and
,
besides
,
he
was
afraid
of
putting
the
thought
of
her
into
their
*NL*
heads
,
of
setting
them
once
more
upon
her
track
.
But
he
,
to
whom
,
*NL*
up
till
then
,
nothing
could
have
seemed
so
tedious
as
was
all
that
*NL*
pertained
to
the
cosmopolitan
life
of
Baden
or
of
Nice
,
now
that
*NL*
he
learned
that
Odette
had
,
perhaps
,
led
a
`
gay
'
life
once
in
those
*NL*
pleasure-cities
,
although
he
could
never
find
out
whether
it
had
been
*NL*
solely
to
satisfy
a
want
of
money
which
,
thanks
to
himself
,
she
no
*NL*
longer
felt
,
or
from
some
capricious
instinct
which
might
,
at
any
*NL*
moment
,
revive
in
her
,
he
would
lean
,
in
impotent
anguish
,
blinded
and
*NL*
dizzy
,
over
the
bottomless
abyss
into
which
had
passed
,
in
which
had
*NL*
been
engulfed
those
years
of
his
own
,
early
in
MacMahon
's
_
Septennat
_
,
*NL*
in
which
one
spent
the
winter
on
the
Promenade
des
Anglais
,
the
summer
*NL*
beneath
the
limes
of
Baden
,
and
would
find
in
those
years
a
sad
but
*NL*
splendid
profundity
,
such
as
a
poet
might
have
lent
to
them
;
and
he
*NL*
would
have
devoted
to
the
reconstruction
of
all
the
insignificant
*NL*
details
that
made
up
the
daily
round
on
the
C√¥te
d'Azur
in
those
days
,
*NL*
if
it
could
have
helped
him
to
understand
something
that
still
baffled
*NL*
him
in
the
smile
or
in
the
eyes
of
Odette
,
more
enthusiasm
than
does
*NL*
the
aesthete
who
ransacks
the
extant
documents
of
fifteenth-century
*NL*
Florence
,
so
as
to
try
to
penetrate
further
into
the
soul
of
the
*NL*
Primavera
,
the
fair
Vanna
or
the
Venus
of
Botticelli
.
He
would
sit
,
*NL*
often
,
without
saying
a
word
to
her
,
only
gazing
at
her
and
dreaming
;
*NL*
and
she
would
comment
:
``
You
do
look
sad
!
''
It
was
not
very
long
since
,
*NL*
from
the
idea
that
she
was
an
excellent
creature
,
comparable
to
the
best
*NL*
women
that
he
had
known
,
he
had
passed
to
that
of
her
being
`
kept
'
;
and
*NL*
yet
already
,
by
an
inverse
process
,
he
had
returned
from
the
Odette
de
*NL*
Cr√©cy
,
perhaps
too
well
known
to
the
holiday-makers
,
to
the
`
ladies
'
*NL*
men
'
of
Nice
and
Baden
,
to
this
face
,
the
expression
on
which
was
so
*NL*
often
gentle
,
to
this
nature
so
eminently
human
.
He
would
ask
himself
:
*NL*
``
What
does
it
mean
,
after
all
,
to
say
that
everyone
at
Nice
knows
who
*NL*
Odette
de
Cr√©cy
is
?
Reputations
of
that
sort
,
even
when
they
're
true
,
*NL*
are
always
based
upon
other
people
's
ideas
''
;
he
would
reflect
that
this
*NL*
legend
--
even
if
it
were
authentic
--
was
something
external
to
Odette
,
*NL*
was
not
inherent
in
her
like
a
mischievous
and
ineradicable
personality
;
*NL*
that
the
creature
who
might
have
been
led
astray
was
a
woman
with
frank
*NL*
eyes
,
a
heart
full
of
pity
for
the
sufferings
of
others
,
a
docile
body
*NL*
which
he
had
pressed
tightly
in
his
arms
and
explored
with
his
fingers
,
*NL*
a
woman
of
whom
he
might
one
day
come
into
absolute
possession
if
he
*NL*
succeeded
in
making
himself
indispensable
to
her
.
There
she
was
,
*NL*
often
tired
,
her
face
left
blank
for
the
nonce
by
that
eager
,
feverish
*NL*
preoccupation
with
the
unknown
things
which
made
Swann
suffer
;
she
would
*NL*
push
back
her
hair
with
both
hands
;
her
forehead
,
her
whole
face
would
*NL*
seem
to
grow
larger
;
then
,
suddenly
,
some
ordinary
human
thought
,
some
*NL*
worthy
sentiment
such
as
is
to
be
found
in
all
creatures
when
,
in
a
*NL*
moment
of
rest
or
meditation
,
they
are
free
to
express
themselves
,
would
*NL*
flash
out
from
her
eyes
like
a
ray
of
gold
.
And
immediately
the
whole
of
*NL*
her
face
would
light
up
like
a
grey
landscape
,
swathed
in
clouds
which
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
are
swept
away
and
the
dull
scene
transfigured
,
at
the
moment
*NL*
of
the
sun
's
setting
.
The
life
which
occupied
Odette
at
such
times
,
even
*NL*
the
future
which
she
seemed
to
be
dreamily
regarding
,
Swann
could
have
*NL*
shared
with
her
.
No
evil
disturbance
seemed
to
have
left
any
effect
on
*NL*
them
.
Rare
as
they
became
,
those
moments
did
not
occur
in
vain
.
By
the
*NL*
process
of
memory
,
Swann
joined
the
fragments
together
,
abolished
the
*NL*
intervals
between
them
,
cast
,
as
in
molten
gold
,
the
image
of
an
Odette
*NL*
compact
of
kindness
and
tranquillity
,
for
whom
he
was
to
make
,
later
on
*NL*
-LRB-
as
we
shall
see
in
the
second
part
of
this
story
-RRB-
sacrifices
which
the
*NL*
other
Odette
would
never
have
won
from
him
.
But
how
rare
those
moments
*NL*
were
,
and
how
seldom
he
now
saw
her
!
Even
in
regard
to
their
evening
*NL*
meetings
,
she
would
never
tell
him
until
the
last
minute
whether
she
*NL*
would
be
able
to
see
him
,
for
,
reckoning
on
his
being
always
free
,
she
*NL*
wished
first
to
be
certain
that
no
one
else
would
offer
to
come
to
her
.
*NL*
She
would
plead
that
she
was
obliged
to
wait
for
an
answer
which
was
of
*NL*
the
very
greatest
importance
,
and
if
,
even
after
she
had
made
Swann
*NL*
come
to
her
house
,
any
of
her
friends
asked
her
,
half-way
through
the
*NL*
evening
,
to
join
them
at
some
theatre
,
or
at
supper
afterwards
,
she
*NL*
would
jump
for
joy
and
dress
herself
with
all
speed
.
As
her
toilet
*NL*
progressed
,
every
movement
that
she
made
brought
Swann
nearer
to
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
would
have
to
part
from
her
,
when
she
would
fly
off
with
*NL*
irresistible
force
;
and
when
at
length
she
was
ready
,
and
,
Plunging
into
*NL*
her
mirror
a
last
glance
strained
and
brightened
by
her
anxiety
to
look
*NL*
well
,
smeared
a
little
salve
on
her
lips
,
fixed
a
stray
loci
of
hair
*NL*
over
her
brow
,
and
called
for
her
cloak
of
sky-blue
silk
with
golden
*NL*
tassels
,
Swann
would
be
looking
so
wretched
that
she
would
be
unable
to
*NL*
restrain
a
gesture
of
impatience
as
she
flung
at
him
:
``
So
that
is
how
*NL*
you
thank
me
for
keeping
you
here
till
the
last
minute
!
And
I
thought
*NL*
I
was
being
so
nice
to
you
.
Well
,
I
shall
know
better
another
time
!
''
*NL*
Sometime
...
at
the
risk
of
annoying
her
,
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
*NL*
would
find
out
where
she
had
gone
,
and
even
dreamed
of
a
defensive
*NL*
alliance
with
Forcheville
,
who
might
perhaps
have
been
able
to
tell
him
.
*NL*
But
anyhow
,
when
he
knew
with
whom
she
was
spending
the
evening
,
it
*NL*
was
very
seldom
that
he
could
not
discover
,
among
all
his
innumerable
*NL*
acquaintance
,
some
one
who
knew
--
if
only
indirectly
--
the
man
with
*NL*
whom
she
had
gone
out
,
and
could
easily
obtain
this
or
that
piece
of
*NL*
information
about
him
.
And
while
he
was
writing
to
one
of
his
friends
,
*NL*
asking
him
to
try
to
get
a
little
light
thrown
upon
some
point
or
other
,
*NL*
he
would
feel
a
sense
of
relief
on
ceasing
to
vex
himself
with
questions
*NL*
to
which
there
was
no
answer
and
transferring
to
some
one
else
the
*NL*
strain
of
interrogation
.
It
is
true
that
Swann
was
little
the
wiser
for
*NL*
such
information
as
he
did
receive
.
To
know
a
thing
does
not
enable
us
,
*NL*
always
,
to
prevent
its
happening
,
but
after
all
the
things
that
we
know
*NL*
we
do
hold
,
if
not
in
our
hands
,
at
any
rate
in
our
minds
,
where
we
can
*NL*
dispose
of
them
as
we
choose
,
which
gives
us
the
illusion
of
a
sort
of
*NL*
power
to
control
them
.
He
was
quite
happy
whenever
M.
de
Charlus
was
*NL*
with
Odette
.
He
knew
that
between
M.
de
Charlus
and
her
nothing
untoward
*NL*
could
ever
happen
,
that
when
M.
de
Charlus
went
anywhere
with
her
,
it
*NL*
was
out
of
friendship
for
himself
,
and
that
he
would
make
no
difficulty
*NL*
about
telling
him
everything
that
she
had
done
.
Sometimes
she
had
*NL*
declared
so
emphatically
to
Swann
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
see
*NL*
her
on
a
particular
evening
,
she
seemed
to
be
looking
forward
so
keenly
*NL*
to
some
outing
,
that
Swann
attached
a
very
real
importance
to
the
fact
*NL*
that
M.
de
Charlus
was
free
to
accompany
her
.
Next
day
,
without
daring
*NL*
to
put
many
questions
to
M.
de
Charlus
,
he
would
force
him
,
by
appearing
*NL*
not
quite
to
understand
his
first
answers
,
to
give
him
more
,
after
each
*NL*
of
which
he
would
feel
himself
increasingly
relieved
,
for
he
very
*NL*
soon
learned
that
Odette
had
spent
her
evening
in
the
most
innocent
of
*NL*
dissipations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
you
mean
,
my
dear
M√©m√©
,
I
do
n't
quite
understand
...
You
*NL*
did
n't
go
straight
from
her
house
to
the
Mus√©e
Gr√©vin
?
Surely
you
went
*NL*
somewhere
else
first
?
No
?
That
is
very
odd
!
You
do
n't
know
how
amusing
*NL*
you
are
,
my
dear
M√©m√©
.
But
what
an
odd
idea
of
hers
to
go
on
to
the
Chat
*NL*
Noir
afterwards
;
it
was
her
idea
,
I
suppose
?
No
?
Yours
?
That
's
strange
.
*NL*
After
all
,
it
was
n't
a
bad
idea
;
she
must
have
known
dozens
of
people
*NL*
there
?
No
?
She
never
spoke
to
a
soul
?
How
extraordinary
!
Then
you
sat
*NL*
there
like
that
,
just
you
and
she
,
all
by
yourselves
?
I
can
picture
you
,
*NL*
sitting
there
!
You
are
a
worthy
fellow
,
my
dear
M√©m√©
;
I
'm
exceedingly
*NL*
fond
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
was
now
quite
at
ease
.
To
him
,
who
had
so
often
happened
,
when
*NL*
talking
to
friends
who
knew
nothing
of
his
love
,
friends
to
whom
he
*NL*
hardly
listened
,
to
hear
certain
detached
sentences
-LRB-
as
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
``
I
saw
Mme.
de
Cr√©cy
yesterday
;
she
was
with
a
man
I
did
n't
know
.
''
-RRB-
,
*NL*
sentences
which
dropped
into
his
heart
and
passed
at
once
into
a
solid
*NL*
state
,
grew
hard
as
stalagmites
,
and
seared
and
tore
him
as
they
lay
*NL*
there
irremovable
,
--
how
charming
,
by
way
of
contrast
,
were
the
words
:
*NL*
``
She
did
n't
know
a
soul
;
she
never
spoke
to
a
soul
.
''
How
freely
they
*NL*
coursed
through
him
,
how
fluid
they
were
,
how
vaporous
,
how
easy
to
*NL*
breathe
!
And
yet
,
a
moment
later
,
he
was
telling
himself
that
Odette
*NL*
must
find
him
very
dull
if
those
were
the
pleasures
that
she
preferred
*NL*
to
his
company
.
And
their
very
insignificance
,
though
it
reassured
him
,
*NL*
pained
him
as
if
her
enjoyment
of
them
had
been
an
act
of
treachery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
when
he
could
not
discover
where
she
had
gone
,
it
would
have
*NL*
sufficed
to
alleviate
the
anguish
that
he
then
felt
,
for
which
Odette
's
*NL*
presence
,
the
charm
of
her
company
,
was
the
sole
specific
-LRB-
a
specific
*NL*
which
in
the
long
run
served
,
like
many
other
remedies
,
to
aggravate
the
*NL*
disease
,
but
at
least
brought
temporary
relief
to
his
sufferings
-RRB-
,
it
*NL*
would
have
sufficed
,
had
Odette
only
permitted
him
to
remain
in
her
*NL*
house
while
she
was
out
,
to
wait
there
until
that
hour
of
her
return
,
*NL*
into
whose
stillness
and
peace
would
flow
,
to
be
mingled
and
lost
there
,
*NL*
all
memory
of
those
intervening
hours
which
some
sorcery
,
some
cursed
*NL*
spell
had
made
him
imagine
as
,
somehow
,
different
from
the
rest
.
But
she
*NL*
would
not
;
he
must
return
home
;
he
forced
himself
,
on
the
way
,
to
form
*NL*
various
plans
,
ceased
to
think
of
Odette
;
he
even
reached
the
stage
,
*NL*
while
he
undressed
,
of
turning
over
all
sorts
of
happy
ideas
in
his
*NL*
mind
:
it
was
with
a
light
heart
,
buoyed
with
the
anticipation
of
going
*NL*
to
see
some
favourite
work
of
art
on
the
morrow
,
that
he
jumped
into
*NL*
bed
and
turned
out
the
light
;
but
no
sooner
had
he
made
himself
ready
*NL*
to
sleep
,
relaxing
a
self-control
of
which
he
was
not
even
conscious
,
*NL*
so
habitual
had
it
become
,
than
an
icy
shudder
convulsed
his
body
and
he
*NL*
burst
into
sobs
.
He
did
not
wish
to
know
why
,
but
dried
his
eyes
,
saying
*NL*
with
a
smile
:
``
This
is
delightful
;
I
'm
becoming
neurasthenic
.
''
After
*NL*
which
he
could
not
save
himself
from
utter
exhaustion
at
the
thought
*NL*
that
,
next
day
,
he
must
begin
afresh
his
attempt
to
find
out
what
Odette
*NL*
had
been
doing
,
must
use
all
his
influence
to
contrive
to
see
her
.
This
*NL*
compulsion
to
an
activity
without
respite
,
without
variety
,
without
*NL*
result
,
was
so
cruel
a
scourge
that
one
day
,
noticing
a
swelling
over
*NL*
his
stomach
,
he
felt
an
actual
joy
in
the
idea
that
he
had
,
perhaps
,
a
*NL*
tumour
which
would
prove
fatal
,
that
he
need
not
concern
himself
with
*NL*
anything
further
,
that
it
was
his
malady
which
was
going
to
govern
his
*NL*
life
,
to
make
a
plaything
of
him
,
until
the
not-distant
end
.
If
indeed
,
*NL*
at
this
period
,
it
often
happened
that
,
though
without
admitting
it
even
*NL*
to
himself
,
he
longed
for
death
,
it
was
in
order
to
escape
not
so
*NL*
much
from
the
keenness
of
his
sufferings
as
from
the
monotony
of
his
*NL*
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
would
have
wished
to
live
until
the
time
came
when
he
no
*NL*
longer
loved
her
,
when
she
would
have
no
reason
for
lying
to
him
,
when
*NL*
at
length
he
might
learn
from
her
whether
,
on
the
day
when
he
had
gone
*NL*
to
see
her
in
the
afternoon
,
she
had
or
had
not
been
in
the
arms
of
*NL*
Forcheville
.
Often
for
several
days
on
end
the
suspicion
that
she
was
*NL*
in
love
with
some
one
else
would
distract
his
mind
from
the
question
*NL*
of
Forcheville
,
making
it
almost
immaterial
to
him
,
like
those
new
*NL*
developments
of
a
continuous
state
of
ill-health
which
seem
for
a
little
*NL*
time
to
have
delivered
us
from
their
predecessors
.
There
were
even
*NL*
days
when
he
was
not
tormented
by
any
suspicion
.
He
fancied
that
he
was
*NL*
cured
.
But
next
morning
,
when
he
awoke
,
he
felt
in
the
same
place
*NL*
the
same
pain
,
a
sensation
which
,
the
day
before
,
he
had
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
diluted
in
the
torrent
of
different
impressions
.
But
it
had
not
stirred
*NL*
from
its
place
.
Indeed
,
it
was
the
sharpness
of
this
pain
that
had
*NL*
awakened
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Odette
never
gave
him
any
information
as
to
those
vastly
important
*NL*
matters
which
took
up
so
much
of
her
time
every
day
-LRB-
albeit
he
had
lived
*NL*
long
enough
in
the
world
to
know
that
such
matters
are
never
anything
*NL*
else
than
pleasures
-RRB-
he
could
not
sustain
for
any
length
of
time
the
*NL*
effort
to
imagine
them
;
his
brain
would
become
a
void
;
then
he
would
*NL*
pass
a
finger
over
his
tired
eyelids
,
in
the
same
way
as
he
might
have
*NL*
wiped
his
eyeglass
,
and
would
cease
altogether
to
think
.
There
*NL*
emerged
,
however
,
from
this
unexplored
tract
,
certain
occupations
which
*NL*
reappeared
from
time
to
time
,
vaguely
connected
by
Odette
with
some
*NL*
obligation
towards
distant
relatives
or
old
friends
who
,
inasmuch
as
*NL*
they
were
the
only
people
whom
she
was
in
the
habit
of
mentioning
*NL*
as
preventing
her
from
seeing
him
,
seemed
to
Swann
to
compose
the
*NL*
necessary
,
unalterable
setting
of
her
life
.
Because
of
the
tone
in
which
*NL*
she
referred
,
from
time
to
time
,
to
``
the
day
when
I
go
with
my
friend
*NL*
to
the
Hippodrome
,
''
if
,
when
he
felt
unwell
and
had
thought
,
``
Perhaps
*NL*
Odette
would
be
kind
and
come
to
see
me
,
''
he
remembered
,
suddenly
,
that
*NL*
it
was
one
of
those
very
days
,
he
would
correct
himself
with
an
``
Oh
,
*NL*
no
!
It
's
not
worth
while
asking
her
to
come
;
I
should
have
thought
of
it
*NL*
before
,
this
is
the
day
when
she
goes
with
her
friend
to
the
Hippodrome
.
*NL*
We
must
confine
ourselves
to
what
is
possible
;
no
use
wasting
our
time
*NL*
in
proposing
things
that
ca
n't
be
accepted
and
are
declined
in
*NL*
advance
.
''
And
this
duty
that
was
incumbent
upon
Odette
,
of
going
to
the
*NL*
Hippodrome
,
to
which
Swann
thus
gave
way
,
seemed
to
him
to
be
not
merely
*NL*
ineluctable
in
itself
;
but
the
mark
of
necessity
which
stamped
it
seemed
*NL*
to
make
plausible
and
legitimate
everything
that
was
even
remotely
*NL*
connected
with
it
.
If
,
when
Odette
,
in
the
street
,
had
acknowledged
the
*NL*
salute
of
a
passer-by
,
which
had
aroused
Swann
's
jealousy
,
she
replied
*NL*
to
his
questions
by
associating
the
stranger
with
any
of
the
two
or
*NL*
three
paramount
duties
of
which
she
had
often
spoken
to
him
;
if
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
she
said
:
``
That
's
a
gentleman
who
was
in
my
friend
's
box
the
*NL*
other
day
;
the
one
I
go
to
the
Hippodrome
with
,
''
that
explanation
would
*NL*
set
Swann
's
suspicions
at
rest
;
it
was
,
after
all
,
inevitable
that
*NL*
this
friend
should
have
other
guests
than
Odette
in
her
box
at
the
*NL*
Hippodrome
,
but
he
had
never
sought
to
form
or
succeeded
in
forming
any
*NL*
coherent
impression
of
them
.
Oh
!
how
he
would
have
loved
to
know
her
,
*NL*
that
friend
who
went
to
the
Hippodrome
,
how
he
would
have
loved
her
to
*NL*
invite
him
there
with
Odette
.
How
readily
he
would
have
sacrificed
*NL*
all
his
acquaintance
for
no
matter
what
person
who
was
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
seeing
Odette
,
were
she
but
a
manicurist
or
a
girl
out
of
a
shop
.
He
*NL*
would
have
taken
more
trouble
,
incurred
more
expense
for
them
than
for
*NL*
queens
.
Would
they
not
have
supplied
him
,
out
of
what
was
contained
in
*NL*
their
knowledge
of
the
life
of
Odette
,
with
the
one
potent
anodyne
for
*NL*
his
pain
?
With
what
joy
would
he
have
hastened
to
spend
his
days
with
*NL*
one
or
other
of
those
humble
folk
with
whom
Odette
kept
up
friendly
*NL*
relations
,
either
with
some
ulterior
motive
or
from
genuine
simplicity
*NL*
of
nature
.
How
willingly
would
he
have
fixed
his
abode
for
ever
in
the
*NL*
attics
of
some
sordid
but
enviable
house
,
where
Odette
went
but
never
*NL*
took
him
,
and
where
,
if
he
had
lived
with
the
little
retired
dressmaker
,
*NL*
whose
lover
he
would
readily
have
pretended
to
be
,
he
would
have
been
*NL*
visited
by
Odette
almost
daily
.
In
those
regions
,
that
were
almost
*NL*
slums
,
what
a
modest
existence
,
abject
,
if
you
please
,
but
delightful
,
*NL*
nourished
by
tranquillity
and
happiness
,
he
would
have
consented
to
lead
*NL*
indefinitely
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sometimes
happened
,
again
,
that
,
when
,
after
meeting
Swann
,
she
saw
*NL*
some
man
approaching
whom
he
did
not
know
,
he
could
distinguish
upon
*NL*
Odette
's
face
that
look
of
sorrow
which
she
had
worn
on
the
day
when
he
*NL*
had
come
to
her
while
Forcheville
was
there
.
But
this
was
rare
;
for
,
on
*NL*
the
days
when
,
in
spite
of
all
that
she
had
to
do
,
and
of
her
dread
*NL*
of
what
people
would
think
,
she
did
actually
manage
to
see
Swann
,
the
*NL*
predominant
quality
in
her
attitude
,
now
,
was
self-assurance
;
a
striking
*NL*
contrast
,
perhaps
an
unconscious
revenge
for
,
perhaps
a
natural
reaction
*NL*
from
the
timorous
emotion
which
,
in
the
early
days
of
their
friendship
,
*NL*
she
had
felt
in
his
presence
,
and
even
in
his
absence
,
when
she
began
a
*NL*
letter
to
him
with
the
words
:
``
My
dear
,
my
hand
trembles
so
that
I
can
*NL*
scarcely
write
.
''
-LRB-
So
,
at
least
,
she
pretended
,
and
a
little
of
that
*NL*
emotion
must
have
been
sincere
,
or
she
would
not
have
been
anxious
to
*NL*
enlarge
and
emphasise
it
.
-RRB-
So
Swann
had
been
pleasing
to
her
then
.
Our
*NL*
hands
do
not
tremble
except
for
ourselves
,
or
for
those
whom
we
love
.
*NL*
When
they
have
ceased
to
control
our
happiness
how
peaceful
,
how
easy
,
*NL*
how
bold
do
we
become
in
their
presence
!
In
speaking
to
him
,
in
writing
*NL*
to
him
now
,
she
no
longer
employed
those
words
by
which
she
had
*NL*
sought
to
give
herself
the
illusion
that
he
belonged
to
her
,
creating
*NL*
opportunities
for
saying
``
my
''
and
``
mine
''
when
she
referred
to
him
:
``
You
*NL*
are
all
that
I
have
in
the
world
;
it
is
the
perfume
of
our
friendship
,
I
*NL*
shall
keep
it
,
''
nor
spoke
to
him
of
the
future
,
of
death
itself
,
as
of
*NL*
a
single
adventure
which
they
would
have
to
share
.
In
those
early
days
,
*NL*
whatever
he
might
say
to
her
,
she
would
answer
admiringly
:
``
You
know
,
*NL*
you
will
never
be
like
other
people
!
''
--
she
would
gaze
at
his
long
,
*NL*
slightly
bald
head
,
of
which
people
who
know
only
of
his
successes
*NL*
used
to
think
:
``
He
's
not
regularly
good-looking
,
if
you
like
,
but
he
is
*NL*
smart
;
that
tuft
,
that
eyeglass
,
that
smile
!
''
and
,
with
more
curiosity
*NL*
perhaps
to
know
him
as
he
really
was
than
desire
to
become
his
mistress
,
*NL*
she
would
sigh
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
wish
I
could
find
out
what
there
is
in
that
head
of
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
now
,
whatever
he
might
say
,
she
would
answer
,
in
a
tone
sometimes
*NL*
of
irritation
,
sometimes
indulgent
:
``
Ah
!
so
you
never
will
be
like
other
*NL*
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
gaze
at
his
head
,
which
was
hardly
aged
at
all
by
his
recent
*NL*
anxieties
-LRB-
though
people
now
thought
of
it
,
by
the
same
mental
process
*NL*
which
enables
one
to
discover
the
meaning
of
a
piece
of
symphonic
music
*NL*
of
which
one
has
read
the
programme
,
or
the
`
likenesses
'
in
a
child
*NL*
whose
family
one
has
known
:
``
He
's
not
positively
ugly
,
if
you
like
,
*NL*
but
he
is
really
rather
absurd
;
that
eyeglass
,
that
tuft
,
that
smile
!
''
*NL*
realising
in
their
imagination
,
fed
by
suggestion
,
the
invisible
*NL*
boundary
which
divides
,
at
a
few
months
'
interval
,
the
head
of
an
ardent
*NL*
lover
from
a
cuckold
's
-RRB-
,
and
would
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
wish
I
could
change
you
;
put
some
sense
into
that
head
of
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Always
ready
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
what
he
hoped
,
if
it
was
only
*NL*
Odette
's
way
of
behaving
to
him
that
left
room
for
doubt
,
he
would
fling
*NL*
himself
greedily
upon
her
words
:
``
You
can
if
you
like
,
''
he
would
tell
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
tried
to
explain
to
her
that
to
comfort
him
,
to
control
him
,
to
*NL*
make
him
work
would
be
a
noble
task
,
to
which
numbers
of
other
women
*NL*
asked
for
nothing
better
than
to
be
allowed
to
devote
themselves
,
though
*NL*
it
is
only
fair
to
add
that
in
those
other
women
's
hands
the
noble
*NL*
task
would
have
seemed
to
Swann
nothing
more
than
an
indiscreet
and
*NL*
intolerable
usurpation
of
his
freedom
of
action
.
``
If
she
did
n't
love
me
,
*NL*
just
a
little
,
''
he
told
himself
,
``
she
would
not
wish
to
have
me
altered
.
*NL*
To
alter
me
,
she
will
have
to
see
me
more
often
.
''
And
so
he
was
able
to
*NL*
trace
,
in
these
faults
which
she
found
in
him
,
a
proof
at
least
of
*NL*
her
interest
,
perhaps
even
of
her
love
;
and
,
in
fact
,
she
gave
him
so
*NL*
little
,
now
,
of
the
last
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
regard
as
proofs
of
*NL*
her
interest
in
him
the
various
things
which
,
every
now
and
then
,
she
*NL*
forbade
him
to
do
.
One
day
she
announced
that
she
did
not
care
for
his
*NL*
coachman
,
who
,
she
thought
,
was
perhaps
setting
Swann
against
her
,
and
,
*NL*
anyhow
,
did
not
shew
that
promptness
and
deference
to
Swann
's
orders
*NL*
which
she
would
have
liked
to
see
.
She
felt
that
he
wanted
to
hear
her
*NL*
say
:
``
Do
n't
have
him
again
when
you
come
to
me
,
''
just
as
he
might
have
*NL*
wanted
her
to
kiss
him
.
So
,
being
in
a
good
temper
,
she
said
it
;
and
he
*NL*
was
deeply
moved
.
That
evening
,
when
talking
to
M.
de
Charlus
,
with
whom
*NL*
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
speak
of
her
openly
-LRB-
for
the
*NL*
most
trivial
remarks
that
he
uttered
now
,
even
to
people
who
had
never
*NL*
heard
of
her
,
had
always
some
sort
of
reference
to
Odette
-RRB-
,
he
said
to
*NL*
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
,
all
the
same
,
that
she
loves
me
;
she
is
so
nice
to
me
now
,
*NL*
and
she
certainly
takes
an
interest
in
what
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
,
when
he
was
starting
off
for
her
house
,
getting
into
his
*NL*
carriage
with
a
friend
whom
he
was
to
drop
somewhere
on
the
way
,
*NL*
his
friend
said
:
``
Hullo
!
that
is
n't
Loredan
on
the
box
?
''
with
what
*NL*
melancholy
joy
would
Swann
answer
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Good
heavens
,
no
!
I
can
tell
you
,
I
dare
n't
take
Loredan
when
I
*NL*
go
to
the
Rue
La
P√©rouse
;
Odette
does
n't
like
me
to
have
Loredan
,
she
*NL*
thinks
he
does
n't
suit
me
.
What
on
earth
is
one
to
do
?
Women
,
you
know
,
*NL*
women
.
My
dear
fellow
,
she
would
be
furious
.
Oh
,
lord
,
yes
;
I
've
only
to
*NL*
take
R√©mi
there
;
I
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
new
manners
,
indifferent
,
listless
,
irritable
,
which
Odette
now
*NL*
adopted
with
Swann
,
undoubtedly
made
him
suffer
;
but
he
did
not
realise
*NL*
how
much
he
suffered
;
since
it
had
been
with
a
regular
progression
,
day
*NL*
after
day
,
that
Odette
had
chilled
towards
him
,
it
was
only
by
directly
*NL*
contrasting
what
she
was
to-day
with
what
she
had
been
at
first
that
he
*NL*
could
have
measured
the
extent
of
the
change
that
had
taken
place
.
Now
*NL*
this
change
was
his
deep
,
his
secret
wound
,
which
pained
him
day
and
*NL*
night
,
and
whenever
he
felt
that
his
thoughts
were
straying
too
near
it
,
*NL*
he
would
quickly
turn
them
into
another
channel
for
fear
of
being
made
*NL*
to
suffer
too
keenly
.
He
might
say
to
himself
in
a
vague
way
:
``
There
*NL*
was
a
time
when
Odette
loved
me
more
,
''
but
he
never
formed
any
definite
*NL*
picture
of
that
time
.
Just
as
he
had
in
his
study
a
cupboard
at
which
he
*NL*
contrived
never
to
look
,
which
he
turned
aside
to
avoid
passing
whenever
*NL*
he
entered
or
left
the
room
,
because
in
one
of
its
drawers
he
had
locked
*NL*
away
the
chrysanthemum
which
she
had
given
him
on
one
of
those
first
*NL*
evenings
when
he
had
taken
her
home
in
his
carriage
,
and
the
letters
in
*NL*
which
she
said
:
``
Why
did
you
not
forget
your
heart
also
?
I
should
never
*NL*
have
let
you
have
that
back
,
''
and
``
At
whatever
hour
of
the
day
or
night
*NL*
you
may
need
me
,
just
send
me
a
word
,
and
dispose
of
me
as
you
please
,
''
*NL*
so
there
was
a
place
in
his
heart
to
which
he
would
never
allow
his
*NL*
thoughts
to
trespass
too
near
,
forcing
them
,
if
need
be
,
to
evade
it
by
*NL*
a
long
course
of
reasoning
so
that
they
should
not
have
to
pass
within
*NL*
reach
of
it
;
the
place
in
which
lingered
his
memories
of
happy
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
so
meticulous
prudence
was
defeated
one
evening
when
he
had
gone
*NL*
out
to
a
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
Marquise
de
Saint-Euverte
's
,
on
the
last
,
for
that
season
,
*NL*
of
the
evenings
on
which
she
invited
people
to
listen
to
the
musicians
*NL*
who
would
serve
,
later
on
,
for
her
charity
concerts
.
Swann
,
who
had
*NL*
intended
to
go
to
each
of
the
previous
evenings
in
turn
,
but
had
never
*NL*
been
able
to
make
up
his
mind
,
received
,
while
he
was
dressing
for
this
*NL*
party
,
a
visit
from
the
Baron
de
Charlus
,
who
came
with
an
offer
to
*NL*
go
with
him
to
the
Marquise
's
,
if
his
company
could
be
of
any
use
in
*NL*
helping
Swann
not
to
feel
quite
so
bored
when
he
got
there
,
to
be
a
*NL*
little
less
unhappy
.
But
Swann
had
thanked
him
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
conceive
how
glad
I
should
be
of
your
company
.
But
the
*NL*
greatest
pleasure
that
you
can
give
me
will
be
if
you
will
go
instead
*NL*
to
see
Odette
.
You
know
what
a
splendid
influence
you
have
over
her
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
suppose
she
'll
be
going
anywhere
this
evening
,
unless
she
goes
to
*NL*
see
her
old
dressmaker
,
and
I
'm
sure
she
would
be
delighted
if
you
went
*NL*
with
her
there
.
In
any
case
,
you
'll
find
her
at
home
before
then
.
Try
*NL*
to
keep
her
amused
,
and
also
to
give
her
a
little
sound
advice
.
If
you
*NL*
could
arrange
something
for
to-morrow
which
would
please
her
,
something
*NL*
that
we
could
all
three
do
together
.
Try
to
put
out
a
feeler
,
too
,
for
*NL*
the
summer
;
see
if
there
's
anything
she
wants
to
do
,
a
cruise
that
we
*NL*
might
all
three
take
;
anything
you
can
think
of
.
I
do
n't
count
upon
*NL*
seeing
her
to-night
,
myself
;
still
if
she
would
like
me
to
come
,
or
*NL*
if
you
find
a
loophole
,
you
've
only
to
send
me
a
line
at
Mme.
de
*NL*
Saint-Euverte
's
up
till
midnight
;
after
that
I
shall
be
here
.
Ever
so
*NL*
many
thanks
for
all
you
are
doing
for
me
--
you
know
what
I
feel
about
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
promised
to
go
and
do
as
Swann
wished
as
soon
as
he
had
*NL*
deposited
him
at
the
door
of
the
Saint-Euverte
house
,
where
he
arrived
*NL*
soothed
by
the
thought
that
M.
de
Charlus
would
be
spending
the
evening
*NL*
in
the
Rue
La
P√©rouse
,
but
in
a
state
of
melancholy
indifference
to
*NL*
everything
that
did
not
involve
Odette
,
and
in
particular
to
the
details
*NL*
of
fashionable
life
,
a
state
which
invested
them
with
the
charm
that
is
*NL*
to
be
found
in
anything
which
,
being
no
longer
an
object
of
our
desire
,
*NL*
appears
to
us
in
its
own
guise
.
On
alighting
from
his
carriage
,
in
the
*NL*
foreground
of
that
fictitious
summary
of
their
domestic
existence
which
*NL*
hostesses
are
pleased
to
offer
to
their
guests
on
ceremonial
occasions
,
*NL*
and
in
which
they
shew
a
great
regard
for
accuracy
of
costume
and
*NL*
setting
,
Swann
was
amused
to
discover
the
heirs
and
successors
of
*NL*
Balzac
's
`
tigers
'
--
now
`
grooms
'
--
.
who
normally
followed
their
mistress
*NL*
when
she
walked
abroad
,
but
now
,
hatted
and
booted
,
were
posted
out
*NL*
of
doors
,
in
front
of
the
house
on
the
gravelled
drive
,
or
outside
the
*NL*
stables
,
as
gardeners
might
be
drawn
up
for
inspection
at
the
ends
of
*NL*
their
several
flower-beds
.
The
peculiar
tendency
which
he
had
always
*NL*
had
to
look
for
analogies
between
living
people
and
the
portraits
*NL*
in
galleries
reasserted
itself
here
,
but
in
a
more
positive
and
more
*NL*
general
form
;
it
was
society
as
a
whole
,
now
that
he
was
detached
*NL*
from
it
,
which
presented
itself
to
him
in
a
series
of
pictures
.
In
the
*NL*
cloak-room
,
into
which
,
in
the
old
days
,
when
he
was
still
a
man
of
*NL*
fashion
,
he
would
have
gone
in
his
overcoat
,
to
emerge
from
it
in
*NL*
evening
dress
,
but
without
any
impression
of
what
had
occurred
there
,
*NL*
his
mind
having
been
,
during
the
minute
or
two
that
he
had
spent
in
*NL*
it
,
either
still
at
the
party
which
he
had
just
left
,
or
already
at
the
*NL*
party
into
which
he
was
just
about
to
be
ushered
,
he
now
noticed
,
for
*NL*
the
first
time
,
roused
by
the
unexpected
arrival
of
so
belated
a
guest
,
*NL*
the
scattered
pack
of
splendid
effortless
animals
,
the
enormous
footmen
*NL*
who
were
drowsing
here
and
there
upon
benches
and
chests
,
until
,
*NL*
pointing
their
noble
greyhound
profiles
,
they
towered
upon
their
feet
*NL*
and
gathered
in
a
circle
round
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
,
of
a
particularly
ferocious
aspect
,
and
not
unlike
the
*NL*
headsman
in
certain
Renaissance
pictures
which
represent
executions
,
*NL*
tortures
,
and
the
like
,
advanced
upon
him
with
an
implacable
air
to
take
*NL*
his
`
things
.
'
But
the
harshness
of
his
steely
glare
was
compensated
by
*NL*
the
softness
of
his
cotton
gloves
,
so
effectively
that
,
as
he
approached
*NL*
Swann
,
he
seemed
to
be
exhibiting
at
once
an
utter
contempt
for
his
*NL*
person
and
the
most
tender
regard
for
his
hat
.
He
took
it
with
a
care
to
*NL*
which
the
precision
of
his
movements
imparted
something
that
was
almost
*NL*
over-fastidious
,
and
with
a
delicacy
that
was
rendered
almost
touching
*NL*
by
the
evidence
of
his
splendid
strength
.
Then
he
passed
it
to
one
of
*NL*
his
satellites
,
a
novice
and
timid
,
who
was
expressing
the
panic
that
*NL*
overpowered
him
by
casting
furious
glances
in
every
direction
,
and
*NL*
displayed
all
the
dumb
agitation
of
a
wild
animal
in
the
first
hours
of
*NL*
its
captivity
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
feet
away
,
a
strapping
great
lad
in
livery
stood
musing
,
*NL*
motionless
,
statuesque
,
useless
,
like
that
purely
decorative
warrior
*NL*
whom
one
sees
in
the
most
tumultuous
of
Mantegna
's
paintings
,
lost
in
*NL*
dreams
,
leaning
upon
his
shield
,
while
all
around
him
are
fighting
and
*NL*
bloodshed
and
death
;
detached
from
the
group
of
his
companions
who
were
*NL*
thronging
about
Swann
,
he
seemed
as
determined
to
remain
unconcerned
in
*NL*
the
scene
,
which
he
followed
vaguely
with
his
cruel
,
greenish
eyes
,
as
*NL*
if
it
had
been
the
Massacre
of
the
Innocents
or
the
Martyrdom
of
Saint
*NL*
James
.
He
seemed
precisely
to
have
sprung
from
that
vanished
race
--
if
,
*NL*
indeed
,
it
ever
existed
,
save
in
the
reredos
of
San
Zeno
and
the
*NL*
frescoes
of
the
Eremitani
,
where
Swann
had
come
in
contact
with
it
,
and
*NL*
where
it
still
dreams
--
fruit
of
the
impregnation
of
a
classical
statue
*NL*
by
some
one
of
the
Master
's
Paduan
models
,
or
of
Albert
Duerer
's
Saxons
.
*NL*
And
the
locks
of
his
reddish
hair
,
crinkled
by
nature
,
but
glued
to
his
*NL*
head
by
brilliantine
,
were
treated
broadly
as
they
are
in
that
Greek
*NL*
sculpture
which
the
Mantuan
painter
never
ceased
to
study
,
and
which
,
*NL*
if
in
its
creator
's
purpose
it
represents
but
man
,
manages
at
least
to
*NL*
extract
from
man
's
simple
outlines
such
a
variety
of
richness
,
borrowed
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
from
the
whole
of
animated
nature
,
that
a
head
of
hair
,
*NL*
by
the
glossy
undulation
and
beak-like
points
of
its
curls
,
or
in
the
*NL*
overlaying
of
the
florid
triple
diadem
of
its
brushed
tresses
,
can
*NL*
suggest
at
once
a
bunch
of
seaweed
,
a
brood
of
fledgling
doves
,
a
bed
of
*NL*
hyacinths
and
a
serpent
's
writhing
back
.
Others
again
,
no
less
colossal
,
*NL*
were
disposed
upon
the
steps
of
a
monumental
staircase
which
,
by
their
*NL*
decorative
presence
and
marmorean
immobility
,
was
made
worthy
to
be
*NL*
named
,
like
that
god-crowned
ascent
in
the
Palace
of
the
Doges
,
the
*NL*
`
Staircase
of
the
Giants
,
'
and
on
which
Swann
now
set
foot
,
saddened
by
*NL*
the
thought
that
Odette
had
never
climbed
it
.
Ah
,
with
what
joy
would
*NL*
he
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
raced
up
the
dark
,
evil-smelling
,
breakneck
*NL*
flights
to
the
little
dressmaker
's
,
in
whose
attic
he
would
so
gladly
*NL*
have
paid
the
price
of
a
weekly
stage-box
at
the
Opera
for
the
right
to
*NL*
spend
the
evening
there
when
Odette
came
,
and
other
days
too
,
for
the
*NL*
privilege
of
talking
about
her
,
of
living
among
people
whom
she
was
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
seeing
when
he
was
not
there
,
and
who
,
on
that
account
,
*NL*
seemed
to
keep
secret
among
themselves
some
part
of
the
life
of
his
*NL*
mistress
more
real
,
more
inaccessible
and
more
mysterious
than
anything
*NL*
that
he
knew
.
Whereas
upon
that
pestilential
,
enviable
staircase
to
*NL*
the
old
dressmaker
's
,
since
there
was
no
other
,
no
service
stair
in
the
*NL*
building
,
one
saw
in
the
evening
outside
every
door
an
empty
,
unwashed
*NL*
milk-can
set
out
,
in
readiness
for
the
morning
round
,
upon
the
door-mat
;
*NL*
on
the
despicable
,
enormous
staircase
which
Swann
was
at
that
moment
*NL*
climbing
,
on
either
side
of
him
,
at
different
levels
,
before
each
*NL*
anfractuosity
made
in
its
walls
by
the
window
of
the
porter
's
lodge
or
*NL*
the
entrance
to
a
set
of
rooms
,
representing
the
departments
of
indoor
*NL*
service
which
they
controlled
,
and
doing
homage
for
them
to
the
guests
,
*NL*
a
gate-keeper
,
a
major-domo
,
a
steward
-LRB-
worthy
men
who
spent
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
week
in
semi-independence
in
their
own
domains
,
dined
there
by
*NL*
themselves
like
small
shopkeepers
,
and
might
to-morrow
lapse
to
the
*NL*
plebeian
service
of
some
successful
doctor
or
industrial
magnate
-RRB-
,
*NL*
scrupulous
in
carrying
out
to
the
letter
all
the
instructions
that
had
*NL*
been
heaped
upon
them
before
they
were
allowed
to
don
the
brilliant
*NL*
livery
which
they
wore
only
at
long
intervals
,
and
in
which
they
did
not
*NL*
feel
altogether
at
their
ease
,
stood
each
in
the
arcade
of
his
doorway
,
*NL*
their
splendid
pomp
tempered
by
a
democratic
good-fellowship
,
like
*NL*
saints
in
their
niches
,
and
a
gigantic
usher
,
dressed
Swiss
Guard
*NL*
fashion
,
like
the
beadle
in
a
church
,
struck
the
pavement
with
his
staff
*NL*
as
each
fresh
arrival
passed
him
.
Coming
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
,
up
*NL*
which
he
had
been
followed
by
a
servant
with
a
pallid
countenance
and
*NL*
a
small
pigtail
clubbed
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
like
one
of
Goya
's
*NL*
sacristans
or
a
tabellion
in
an
old
play
,
Swann
passed
by
an
office
in
*NL*
which
the
lackeys
,
seated
like
notaries
before
their
massive
registers
,
*NL*
rose
solemnly
to
their
feet
and
inscribed
his
name
.
He
next
crossed
a
*NL*
little
hall
which
--
just
as
certain
rooms
are
arranged
by
their
owners
*NL*
to
serve
as
the
setting
for
a
single
work
of
art
-LRB-
from
which
they
*NL*
take
their
name
-RRB-
,
and
,
in
their
studied
bareness
,
contain
nothing
else
*NL*
besides
--
displayed
to
him
as
he
entered
it
,
like
some
priceless
effigy
*NL*
by
Benvenuto
Cellini
of
an
armed
watchman
,
a
young
footman
,
his
body
*NL*
slightly
bent
forward
,
rearing
above
his
crimson
gorget
an
even
more
*NL*
crimson
face
,
from
which
seemed
to
burst
forth
torrents
of
fire
,
*NL*
timidity
and
zeal
,
who
,
as
he
pierced
the
Aubusson
tapestries
that
*NL*
screened
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
the
music
was
being
given
with
*NL*
his
impetuous
,
vigilant
,
desperate
gaze
,
appeared
,
with
a
soldierly
*NL*
impassibility
or
a
supernatural
faith
--
an
allegory
of
alarums
,
*NL*
incarnation
of
alertness
,
commemoration
of
a
riot
--
to
be
looking
out
,
*NL*
angel
or
sentinel
,
from
the
tower
of
dungeon
or
cathedral
,
for
the
*NL*
approach
of
the
enemy
or
for
the
hour
of
Judgment
.
Swann
had
now
only
to
*NL*
enter
the
concert-room
,
the
doors
of
which
were
thrown
open
to
him
by
an
*NL*
usher
loaded
with
chains
,
who
bowed
low
before
him
as
though
tendering
*NL*
to
him
the
keys
of
a
conquered
city
.
But
he
thought
of
the
house
*NL*
in
which
at
that
very
moment
he
might
have
been
,
if
Odette
had
but
*NL*
permitted
,
and
the
remembered
glimpse
of
an
empty
milk-can
upon
a
*NL*
door-mat
wrung
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
speedily
recovered
his
sense
of
the
general
ugliness
of
the
human
*NL*
male
when
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
tapestry
curtain
,
the
spectacle
of
*NL*
the
servants
gave
place
to
that
of
the
guests
.
But
even
this
ugliness
of
*NL*
faces
,
which
of
course
were
mostly
familiar
to
him
,
seemed
something
new
*NL*
and
uncanny
,
now
that
their
features
,
--
instead
of
being
to
him
symbols
*NL*
of
practical
utility
in
the
identification
of
this
or
that
man
,
who
*NL*
until
then
had
represented
merely
so
many
pleasures
to
be
sought
after
,
*NL*
boredoms
to
be
avoided
,
or
courtesies
to
be
acknowledged
--
were
at
rest
,
*NL*
measurable
by
aesthetic
co-ordinates
alone
,
in
the
autonomy
of
their
*NL*
curves
and
angles
.
And
in
these
men
,
in
the
thick
of
whom
Swann
now
*NL*
found
himself
packed
,
there
was
nothing
-LRB-
even
to
the
monocle
which
many
*NL*
of
them
wore
,
and
which
,
previously
,
would
,
at
the
most
,
have
enabled
*NL*
Swann
to
say
that
so-and-so
wore
a
monocle
-RRB-
which
,
no
longer
restricted
*NL*
to
the
general
connotation
of
a
habit
,
the
same
in
all
of
them
,
did
not
*NL*
now
strike
him
with
a
sense
of
individuality
in
each
.
Perhaps
because
*NL*
he
did
not
regard
General
de
Froberville
and
the
Marquis
de
Br√©aute
,
who
*NL*
were
talking
together
just
inside
the
door
,
as
anything
more
than
two
*NL*
figures
in
a
picture
,
whereas
they
were
the
old
and
useful
friends
who
*NL*
had
put
him
up
for
the
Jockey
Club
and
had
supported
him
in
duels
,
the
*NL*
General
's
monocle
,
stuck
like
a
shell-splinter
in
his
common
,
scarred
,
*NL*
victorious
,
overbearing
face
,
in
the
middle
of
a
forehead
which
it
*NL*
left
half-blinded
,
like
the
single-eyed
flashing
front
of
the
Cyclops
,
*NL*
appeared
to
Swann
as
a
monstrous
wound
which
it
might
have
been
glorious
*NL*
to
receive
but
which
it
was
certainly
not
decent
to
expose
,
while
*NL*
that
which
M.
de
Br√©aute
wore
,
as
a
festive
badge
,
with
his
pearl-grey
*NL*
gloves
,
his
crush
hat
and
white
tie
,
substituting
it
for
the
familiar
*NL*
pair
of
glasses
-LRB-
as
Swann
himself
did
-RRB-
when
he
went
out
to
places
,
bore
,
*NL*
glued
to
its
other
side
,
like
a
specimen
prepared
on
a
slide
for
the
*NL*
microscope
,
an
infinitesimal
gaze
that
swarmed
with
friendly
feeling
and
*NL*
never
ceased
to
twinkle
at
the
loftiness
of
ceilings
,
the
delightfulness
*NL*
of
parties
,
the
interestingness
of
programmes
and
the
excellence
of
*NL*
refreshments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
!
you
here
!
why
,
it
's
ages
since
I
've
seen
you
,
''
the
General
*NL*
greeted
Swann
and
,
noticing
the
look
of
strain
on
his
face
and
*NL*
concluding
that
it
was
perhaps
a
serious
illness
that
had
kept
him
away
,
*NL*
went
on
,
``
You
're
looking
well
,
old
man
!
''
while
M.
de
Br√©aut√©
turned
*NL*
with
,
``
My
dear
fellow
,
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
?
''
to
a
`
society
*NL*
novelist
'
who
had
just
fitted
into
the
angle
of
eyebrow
and
cheek
his
*NL*
own
monocle
,
the
sole
instrument
that
he
used
in
his
psychological
*NL*
investigations
and
remorseless
analyses
of
character
,
and
who
now
*NL*
replied
,
with
an
air
of
mystery
and
importance
,
rolling
the
`
r
'
:
--
``
I
am
*NL*
observing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Marquis
de
Forestelle
's
monocle
was
minute
and
rimless
,
and
,
by
*NL*
enforcing
an
incessant
and
painful
contraction
of
the
eye
over
which
it
*NL*
was
incrusted
like
a
superfluous
cartilage
,
the
presence
of
which
there
*NL*
was
inexplicable
and
its
substance
unimaginable
,
it
gave
to
his
face
a
*NL*
melancholy
refinement
,
and
led
women
to
suppose
him
capable
of
suffering
*NL*
terribly
when
in
love
.
But
that
of
M.
de
Saint-Cand√©
,
girdled
,
like
*NL*
Saturn
,
with
an
enormous
ring
,
was
the
centre
of
gravity
of
a
face
which
*NL*
composed
itself
afresh
every
moment
in
relation
to
the
glass
,
while
*NL*
his
thrusting
red
nose
and
swollen
sarcastic
lips
endeavoured
by
their
*NL*
grimaces
to
rise
to
the
level
of
the
steady
flame
of
wit
that
sparkled
*NL*
in
the
polished
disk
,
and
saw
itself
preferred
to
the
most
ravishing
*NL*
eyes
in
the
world
by
the
smart
,
depraved
young
women
whom
it
set
*NL*
dreaming
of
artificial
charms
and
a
refinement
of
sensual
bliss
;
and
*NL*
then
,
behind
him
,
M.
de
Palancy
,
who
with
his
huge
carp
's
head
and
*NL*
goggling
eyes
moved
slowly
up
and
down
the
stream
of
festive
gatherings
,
*NL*
unlocking
his
great
mandibles
at
every
moment
as
though
in
search
of
*NL*
his
orientation
,
had
the
air
of
carrying
about
upon
his
person
only
an
*NL*
accidental
and
perhaps
purely
symbolical
fragment
of
the
glass
wall
of
*NL*
his
aquarium
,
a
part
intended
to
suggest
the
whole
which
recalled
to
*NL*
Swann
,
a
fervent
admirer
of
Giotto
's
Vices
and
Virtues
at
Padua
,
that
*NL*
Injustice
by
whose
side
a
leafy
bough
evokes
the
idea
of
the
forests
*NL*
that
enshroud
his
secret
lair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
had
gone
forward
into
the
room
,
under
pressure
from
Mme.
de
*NL*
Saint-Euverte
and
in
order
to
listen
to
an
aria
from
_
Orfeo
_
which
was
*NL*
being
rendered
on
the
flute
,
and
had
taken
up
a
position
in
a
corner
*NL*
from
which
,
unfortunately
,
his
horizon
was
bounded
by
two
ladies
of
*NL*
`
uncertain
'
age
,
seated
side
by
side
,
the
Marquise
de
Cambremer
and
the
*NL*
Vicomtesse
de
Franquetot
,
who
,
because
they
were
cousins
,
used
to
spend
*NL*
their
time
at
parties
in
wandering
through
the
rooms
,
each
clutching
her
*NL*
bag
and
followed
by
her
daughter
,
hunting
for
one
another
like
people
at
*NL*
a
railway
station
,
and
could
never
be
at
rest
until
they
had
reserved
,
*NL*
by
marking
them
with
their
fans
or
handkerchiefs
,
two
adjacent
chairs
;
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cambremer
,
since
she
knew
scarcely
anyone
,
being
all
the
more
*NL*
glad
of
a
companion
,
while
Mme.
de
Franquetot
,
who
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
was
extremely
popular
,
thought
it
effective
and
original
to
shew
all
*NL*
her
fine
friends
that
she
preferred
to
their
company
that
of
an
obscure
*NL*
country
cousin
with
whom
she
had
childish
memories
in
common
.
Filled
*NL*
with
ironical
melancholy
,
Swann
watched
them
as
they
listened
to
the
*NL*
pianoforte
intermezzo
-LRB-
Liszt
's
`
Saint
Francis
preaching
to
the
birds
'
-RRB-
*NL*
which
came
after
the
flute
,
and
followed
the
virtuoso
in
his
dizzy
*NL*
flight
;
Mme.
de
Franquetot
anxiously
,
her
eyes
starting
from
her
head
,
*NL*
as
though
the
keys
over
which
his
fingers
skipped
with
such
agility
were
*NL*
a
series
of
trapezes
,
from
any
one
of
which
he
might
come
crashing
,
*NL*
a
hundred
feet
,
to
the
ground
,
stealing
now
and
then
a
glance
of
*NL*
astonishment
and
unbelief
at
her
companion
,
as
who
should
say
:
``
It
is
n't
*NL*
possible
,
I
would
never
have
believed
that
a
human
being
could
do
all
*NL*
that
!
''
;
Mme.
de
Cambremer
,
as
a
woman
who
had
received
a
sound
musical
*NL*
education
,
beating
time
with
her
head
--
transformed
for
the
nonce
into
*NL*
the
pendulum
of
a
metronome
,
the
sweep
and
rapidity
of
whose
movements
*NL*
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
-LRB-
performed
with
that
look
of
wild
*NL*
abandonment
in
her
eye
which
a
sufferer
shews
who
is
no
longer
able
to
*NL*
analyse
his
pain
,
nor
anxious
to
master
it
,
and
says
merely
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
it
''
-RRB-
so
increased
that
at
every
moment
her
diamond
earrings
caught
*NL*
in
the
trimming
of
her
bodice
,
and
she
was
obliged
to
put
straight
the
*NL*
bunch
of
black
grapes
which
she
had
in
her
hair
,
though
without
any
*NL*
interruption
of
her
constantly
accelerated
motion
.
On
the
other
side
*NL*
-LRB-
and
a
little
way
in
front
-RRB-
of
Mme.
de
Franquetot
,
was
the
Marquise
de
*NL*
Gallardon
,
absorbed
in
her
favourite
meditation
,
namely
upon
her
own
*NL*
kinship
with
the
Guermantes
family
,
from
which
she
derived
both
publicly
*NL*
and
in
private
a
good
deal
of
glory
not
unmingled
with
shame
,
the
most
*NL*
brilliant
ornaments
of
that
house
remaining
somewhat
aloof
from
her
,
*NL*
perhaps
because
she
was
just
a
tiresome
old
woman
,
or
because
she
was
a
*NL*
scandalous
old
woman
,
or
because
she
came
of
an
inferior
branch
of
the
*NL*
family
,
or
very
possibly
for
no
reason
at
all
.
When
she
found
herself
*NL*
seated
next
to
some
one
whom
she
did
not
know
,
as
she
was
at
this
moment
*NL*
next
to
Mme.
de
Franquetot
,
she
suffered
acutely
from
the
feeling
that
*NL*
her
own
consciousness
of
her
Guermantes
connection
could
not
be
made
*NL*
externally
manifest
in
visible
character
like
those
which
,
in
the
*NL*
mosaics
in
Byzantine
churches
,
placed
one
beneath
another
,
inscribe
in
a
*NL*
vertical
column
by
the
side
of
some
Sacred
Personage
the
words
which
he
*NL*
is
supposed
to
be
uttering
.
At
this
moment
she
was
pondering
the
fact
*NL*
that
she
had
never
received
an
invitation
,
or
even
call
,
from
her
young
*NL*
cousin
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
during
the
six
years
that
had
already
*NL*
elapsed
since
the
latter
's
marriage
.
The
thought
filled
her
with
*NL*
anger
--
and
with
pride
;
for
,
by
virtue
of
having
told
everyone
who
*NL*
expressed
surprise
at
never
seeing
her
at
Mme.
des
Laumes
's
,
that
it
*NL*
was
because
of
the
risk
of
meeting
the
Princesse
Mathilde
there
--
a
*NL*
degradation
which
her
own
family
,
the
truest
and
bluest
of
Legitimists
,
*NL*
would
never
have
forgiven
her
,
she
had
come
gradually
to
believe
that
*NL*
this
actually
was
the
reason
for
her
not
visiting
her
young
cousin
.
She
*NL*
remembered
,
it
is
true
,
that
she
had
several
times
inquired
of
Mme.
des
*NL*
Laumes
how
they
might
contrive
to
meet
,
but
she
remembered
it
only
in
*NL*
a
confused
way
,
and
besides
did
more
than
neutralise
this
slightly
*NL*
humiliating
reminiscence
by
murmuring
,
``
After
all
,
it
is
n't
for
me
to
*NL*
take
the
first
step
;
I
am
at
least
twenty
years
older
than
she
is
.
''
And
*NL*
fortified
by
these
unspoken
words
she
flung
her
shoulders
proudly
back
*NL*
until
they
seemed
to
part
company
with
her
bust
,
while
her
head
,
which
*NL*
lay
almost
horizontally
upon
them
,
made
one
think
of
the
`
stuck-on
'
head
*NL*
of
a
pheasant
which
is
brought
to
the
table
regally
adorned
with
its
*NL*
feathers
.
Not
that
she
in
the
least
degree
resembled
a
pheasant
,
having
*NL*
been
endowed
by
nature
with
a
short
and
squat
and
masculine
figure
;
but
*NL*
successive
mortifications
had
given
her
a
backward
tilt
,
such
as
one
may
*NL*
observe
in
trees
which
have
taken
root
on
the
very
edge
of
a
precipice
*NL*
and
are
forced
to
grow
backwards
to
preserve
their
balance
.
Since
she
*NL*
was
obliged
,
in
order
to
console
herself
for
not
being
quite
on
a
level
*NL*
with
the
rest
of
the
Guermantes
,
to
repeat
to
herself
incessantly
that
*NL*
it
was
owing
to
the
uncompromising
rigidity
of
her
principles
and
pride
*NL*
that
she
saw
so
little
of
them
,
the
constant
iteration
had
gradually
*NL*
remoulded
her
body
,
and
had
given
her
a
sort
of
`
bearing
'
which
was
*NL*
accepted
by
the
plebeian
as
a
sign
of
breeding
,
and
even
kindled
,
at
*NL*
times
,
a
momentary
spark
in
the
jaded
eyes
of
old
gentlemen
in
clubs
.
*NL*
Had
anyone
subjected
Mme.
de
Gallardon
's
conversation
to
that
form
of
*NL*
analysis
which
by
noting
the
relative
frequency
of
its
several
terms
*NL*
would
furnish
him
with
the
key
to
a
ciphered
message
,
he
would
at
*NL*
once
have
remarked
that
no
expression
,
not
even
the
commonest
forms
*NL*
of
speech
,
occurred
in
it
nearly
so
often
as
``
at
my
cousins
the
*NL*
Guermantes
's
,
''
``
at
my
aunt
Guermantes
's
,
''
``
Elz√©ar
de
Guermantes
's
*NL*
health
,
''
``
my
cousin
Guermantes
's
box
.
''
If
anyone
spoke
to
her
of
a
*NL*
distinguished
personage
,
she
would
reply
that
,
although
she
was
not
*NL*
personally
acquainted
with
him
,
she
had
seen
him
hundreds
of
times
at
*NL*
her
aunt
Guermantes
's
,
but
she
would
utter
this
reply
in
so
icy
a
tone
,
*NL*
with
such
a
hollow
sound
,
that
it
was
at
once
quite
clear
that
if
*NL*
she
did
not
know
the
celebrity
personally
that
was
because
of
all
the
*NL*
obstinate
,
ineradicable
principles
against
which
her
arching
shoulders
*NL*
were
stretched
back
to
rest
,
as
on
one
of
those
ladders
on
which
*NL*
gymnastic
instructors
make
us
`
extend
'
so
as
to
develop
the
expansion
of
*NL*
our
chests
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
who
had
not
been
expected
to
*NL*
appear
at
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
that
evening
,
did
in
fact
arrive
.
To
*NL*
shew
that
she
did
not
wish
any
special
attention
,
in
a
house
to
which
*NL*
she
had
come
by
an
act
of
condescension
,
to
be
paid
to
her
superior
*NL*
rank
,
she
had
entered
the
room
with
her
arms
pressed
close
to
her
sides
,
*NL*
even
when
there
was
no
crowd
to
be
squeezed
through
,
no
one
attempting
*NL*
to
get
past
her
;
staying
purposely
at
the
back
,
with
the
air
of
being
*NL*
in
her
proper
place
,
like
a
king
who
stands
in
the
waiting
procession
at
*NL*
the
doors
of
a
theatre
where
the
management
have
not
been
warned
of
his
*NL*
coming
;
and
strictly
limiting
her
field
of
vision
--
so
as
not
to
seem
to
*NL*
be
advertising
her
presence
and
claiming
the
consideration
that
was
her
*NL*
due
--
to
the
study
of
a
pattern
in
the
carpet
or
of
her
own
skirt
,
she
*NL*
stood
there
on
the
spot
which
had
struck
her
as
the
most
modest
-LRB-
and
*NL*
from
which
,
as
she
very
well
knew
,
a
cry
of
rapture
from
Mme.
de
*NL*
Saint-Euverte
would
extricate
her
as
soon
as
her
presence
there
was
*NL*
noticed
-RRB-
,
next
to
Mme.
de
Cambremer
,
whom
,
however
,
she
did
not
know
.
*NL*
She
observed
the
dumb-show
by
which
her
neighbour
was
expressing
her
*NL*
passion
for
music
,
but
she
refrained
from
copying
it
.
This
was
not
to
*NL*
say
that
,
for
once
that
she
had
consented
to
spend
a
few
minutes
in
Mme.
*NL*
de
Saint-Euverte
's
house
,
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
would
not
have
wished
*NL*
-LRB-
so
that
the
act
of
politeness
to
her
hostess
which
she
had
performed
by
*NL*
coming
might
,
so
to
speak
,
`
count
double
'
-RRB-
to
shew
herself
as
friendly
*NL*
and
obliging
as
possible
.
But
she
had
a
natural
horror
of
what
she
*NL*
called
`
exaggerating
,
'
and
always
made
a
point
of
letting
people
see
*NL*
that
she
`
simply
must
not
'
indulge
in
any
display
of
emotion
that
was
*NL*
not
in
keeping
with
the
tone
of
the
circle
in
which
she
moved
,
although
*NL*
such
displays
never
failed
to
make
an
impression
upon
her
,
by
virtue
of
*NL*
that
spirit
of
imitation
,
akin
to
timidity
,
which
is
developed
in
the
*NL*
most
self-confident
persons
,
by
contact
with
an
unfamiliar
environment
,
*NL*
even
though
it
be
inferior
to
their
own
.
She
began
to
ask
herself
*NL*
whether
these
gesticulations
might
not
,
perhaps
,
be
a
necessary
*NL*
concomitant
of
the
piece
of
music
that
was
being
played
,
a
piece
which
,
*NL*
it
might
be
,
was
in
a
different
category
from
all
the
music
that
she
had
*NL*
ever
heard
before
;
and
whether
to
abstain
from
them
was
not
a
sign
of
*NL*
her
own
inability
to
understand
the
music
,
and
of
discourtesy
towards
*NL*
the
lady
of
the
house
;
with
the
result
that
,
in
order
to
express
by
a
*NL*
compromise
both
of
her
contradictory
inclinations
in
turn
,
at
one
moment
*NL*
she
would
merely
straighten
her
shoulder-straps
or
feel
in
her
golden
*NL*
hair
for
the
little
balls
of
coral
or
of
pink
enamel
,
frosted
with
tiny
*NL*
diamonds
,
which
formed
its
simple
but
effective
ornament
,
studying
,
with
*NL*
a
cold
interest
,
her
impassioned
neighbour
,
while
at
another
she
would
*NL*
beat
time
for
a
few
bars
with
her
fan
,
but
,
so
as
not
to
forfeit
her
*NL*
independence
,
she
would
beat
a
different
time
from
the
pianist
's
.
When
*NL*
he
had
finished
the
Liszt
Intermezzo
and
had
begun
a
Prelude
by
Chopin
,
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cambremer
turned
to
Mme.
de
Franquetot
with
a
tender
smile
,
*NL*
full
of
intimate
reminiscence
,
as
well
as
of
satisfaction
-LRB-
that
of
*NL*
a
competent
judge
-RRB-
with
the
performance
.
She
had
been
taught
in
her
*NL*
girlhood
to
fondle
and
cherish
those
long-necked
,
sinuous
creatures
,
*NL*
the
phrases
of
Chopin
,
so
free
,
so
flexible
,
so
tactile
,
which
begin
by
*NL*
seeking
their
ultimate
resting-place
somewhere
beyond
and
far
wide
of
*NL*
the
direction
in
which
they
started
,
the
point
which
one
might
have
*NL*
expected
them
to
reach
,
phrases
which
divert
themselves
in
those
*NL*
fantastic
bypaths
only
to
return
more
deliberately
--
with
a
more
*NL*
premeditated
reaction
,
with
more
precision
,
as
on
a
crystal
bowl
which
,
*NL*
if
you
strike
it
,
will
ring
and
throb
until
you
cry
aloud
in
anguish
--
to
*NL*
clutch
at
one
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brought
up
in
a
provincial
household
with
few
friends
or
visitors
,
*NL*
hardly
ever
invited
to
a
ball
,
she
had
fuddled
her
mind
,
in
the
solitude
*NL*
of
her
old
manor-house
,
over
setting
the
pace
,
now
crawling-slow
,
now
*NL*
passionate
,
whirling
,
breathless
,
for
all
those
imaginary
waltzing
*NL*
couples
,
gathering
them
like
flowers
,
leaving
the
ball-room
for
a
moment
*NL*
to
listen
,
where
the
wind
sighed
among
the
pine-trees
,
on
the
shore
of
*NL*
the
lake
,
and
seeing
of
a
sudden
advancing
towards
her
,
more
different
*NL*
from
anything
one
had
ever
dreamed
of
than
earthly
lovers
are
,
a
slender
*NL*
young
man
,
whose
voice
was
resonant
and
strange
and
false
,
in
white
*NL*
gloves
.
But
nowadays
the
old-fashioned
beauty
of
this
music
seemed
*NL*
to
have
become
a
trifle
stale
.
Having
forfeited
,
some
years
back
,
the
*NL*
esteem
of
`
really
musical
'
people
,
it
had
lost
its
distinction
and
its
*NL*
charm
,
and
even
those
whose
taste
was
frankly
bad
had
ceased
to
find
in
*NL*
it
more
than
a
moderate
pleasure
to
which
they
hardly
liked
to
confess
.
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cambremer
cast
a
furtive
glance
behind
her
.
She
knew
that
her
*NL*
young
daughter-in-law
-LRB-
full
of
respect
for
her
new
and
noble
family
,
*NL*
except
in
such
matters
as
related
to
the
intellect
,
upon
which
,
having
*NL*
`
got
as
far
'
as
Harmony
and
the
Greek
alphabet
,
she
was
specially
*NL*
enlightened
-RRB-
despised
Chopin
,
and
fell
quite
ill
when
she
heard
him
*NL*
played
.
But
finding
herself
free
from
the
scrutiny
of
this
Wagnerian
,
*NL*
who
was
sitting
,
at
some
distance
,
in
a
group
of
her
own
contemporaries
,
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cambremer
let
herself
drift
upon
a
stream
of
exquisite
memories
*NL*
and
sensations
.
The
Princesse
des
Laumes
was
touched
also
.
Though
*NL*
without
any
natural
gift
for
music
,
she
had
received
,
some
fifteen
*NL*
years
earlier
,
the
instruction
which
a
music-mistress
of
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Germain
,
a
woman
of
genius
who
had
been
,
towards
the
end
of
*NL*
her
life
,
reduced
to
penury
,
had
started
,
at
seventy
,
to
give
to
the
*NL*
daughters
and
granddaughters
of
her
old
pupils
.
This
lady
was
now
dead
.
*NL*
But
her
method
,
an
echo
of
her
charming
touch
,
came
to
life
now
and
*NL*
then
in
the
fingers
of
her
pupils
,
even
of
those
who
had
been
in
other
*NL*
respects
quite
mediocre
,
had
given
up
music
,
and
hardly
ever
opened
a
*NL*
piano
.
And
so
Mme.
des
Laumes
could
let
her
head
sway
to
and
fro
,
fully
*NL*
aware
of
the
cause
,
with
a
perfect
appreciation
of
the
manner
in
which
*NL*
the
pianist
was
rendering
this
Prelude
,
since
she
knew
it
by
heart
.
The
*NL*
closing
notes
of
the
phrase
that
he
had
begun
sounded
already
on
her
*NL*
lips
.
And
she
murmured
``
How
charming
it
is
!
''
with
a
stress
on
the
*NL*
opening
consonants
of
the
adjective
,
a
token
of
her
refinement
by
which
*NL*
she
felt
her
lips
so
romantically
compressed
,
like
the
petals
of
a
*NL*
beautiful
,
budding
flower
,
that
she
instinctively
brought
her
eyes
into
*NL*
harmony
,
illuminating
them
for
a
moment
with
a
vague
and
sentimental
*NL*
gaze
.
Meanwhile
Mme.
de
Gallardon
had
arrived
at
the
point
of
saying
to
*NL*
herself
how
annoying
it
was
that
she
had
so
few
opportunities
of
meeting
*NL*
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
for
she
meant
to
teach
her
a
lesson
by
not
*NL*
acknowledging
her
bow
.
She
did
not
know
that
her
cousin
was
in
the
room
.
*NL*
A
movement
of
Mme.
Franquetot
's
head
disclosed
the
Princess
.
At
once
*NL*
Mme.
de
Gallardon
dashed
towards
her
,
upsetting
all
her
neighbours
;
*NL*
although
determined
to
preserve
a
distant
and
glacial
manner
which
*NL*
should
remind
everyone
present
that
she
had
no
desire
to
remain
on
*NL*
friendly
terms
with
a
person
in
whose
house
one
might
find
oneself
,
any
*NL*
day
,
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
Princesse
Mathilde
,
and
to
whom
it
was
not
*NL*
her
duty
to
make
advances
since
she
was
not
`
of
her
generation
,
'
*NL*
she
felt
bound
to
modify
this
air
of
dignity
and
reserve
by
some
*NL*
non-committal
remark
which
would
justify
her
overture
and
would
force
*NL*
the
Princess
to
engage
in
conversation
;
and
so
,
when
she
reached
her
*NL*
cousin
,
Mme.
de
Gallardon
,
with
a
stern
countenance
and
one
hand
thrust
*NL*
out
as
though
she
were
trying
to
`
force
'
a
card
,
began
with
:
``
How
is
*NL*
your
husband
?
''
in
the
same
anxious
tone
that
she
would
have
used
if
the
*NL*
Prince
had
been
seriously
ill
.
The
Princess
,
breaking
into
a
laugh
which
*NL*
was
one
of
her
characteristics
,
and
was
intended
at
once
to
shew
the
*NL*
rest
of
an
assembly
that
she
was
making
fun
of
some
one
and
also
to
*NL*
enhance
her
own
beauty
by
concentrating
her
features
around
her
animated
*NL*
lips
and
sparkling
eyes
,
answered
:
``
Why
;
he
's
never
been
better
in
his
*NL*
life
!
''
And
she
went
on
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
de
Gallardon
then
drew
herself
up
and
,
chilling
her
expression
*NL*
still
further
,
perhaps
because
she
was
still
uneasy
about
the
Prince
's
*NL*
health
,
said
to
her
cousin
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oriane
,
''
-LRB-
at
once
Mme.
des
Laumes
looked
with
amused
astonishment
*NL*
towards
an
invisible
third
,
whom
she
seemed
to
call
to
witness
that
she
*NL*
had
never
authorised
Mme.
de
Gallardon
to
use
her
Christian
name
-RRB-
``
I
*NL*
should
be
so
pleased
if
you
would
look
in
,
just
for
a
minute
,
to-morrow
*NL*
evening
,
to
hear
a
quintet
,
with
the
clarinet
,
by
Mozart
.
I
should
like
*NL*
to
have
your
opinion
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
not
so
much
to
be
issuing
an
invitation
as
to
be
asking
*NL*
favour
,
and
to
want
the
Princess
's
opinion
of
the
Mozart
quintet
just
*NL*
though
it
had
been
a
dish
invented
by
a
new
cook
,
whose
talent
it
was
*NL*
most
important
that
an
epicure
should
come
to
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
know
that
quintet
quite
well
.
I
can
tell
you
now
--
that
I
adore
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
my
husband
is
n't
at
all
well
;
it
's
his
liver
.
He
would
like
*NL*
so
much
to
see
you
,
''
Mme.
de
Gallardon
resumed
,
making
it
now
a
corporal
*NL*
work
of
charity
for
the
Princess
to
appear
at
her
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Princess
never
liked
to
tell
people
that
she
would
not
go
to
their
*NL*
houses
.
Every
day
she
would
write
to
express
her
regret
at
having
*NL*
been
kept
away
--
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
her
husband
's
mother
,
by
an
*NL*
invitation
from
his
brother
,
by
the
Opera
,
by
some
excursion
to
the
*NL*
country
--
from
some
party
to
which
she
had
never
for
a
moment
dreamed
of
*NL*
going
.
In
this
way
she
gave
many
people
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
*NL*
she
was
on
intimate
terms
with
them
,
that
she
would
gladly
have
come
to
*NL*
their
houses
,
and
that
she
had
been
prevented
from
doing
so
only
by
some
*NL*
princely
occurrence
which
they
were
flattered
to
find
competing
with
*NL*
their
own
humble
entertainment
.
And
then
,
as
she
belonged
to
that
*NL*
witty
`
Guermantes
set
'
--
in
which
there
survived
something
of
the
*NL*
alert
mentality
,
stripped
of
all
commonplace
phrases
and
conventional
*NL*
sentiments
,
which
dated
from
M√©rim√©e
,
and
found
its
final
expression
in
*NL*
the
plays
of
Meilhac
and
Hal√©vy
--
she
adapted
its
formula
so
as
to
suit
*NL*
even
her
social
engagements
,
transposed
it
into
the
courtesy
which
was
*NL*
always
struggling
to
be
positive
and
precise
,
to
approximate
itself
to
*NL*
the
plain
truth
.
She
would
never
develop
at
any
length
to
a
hostess
the
*NL*
expression
of
her
anxiety
to
be
present
at
her
party
;
she
found
it
more
*NL*
pleasant
to
disclose
to
her
all
the
various
little
incidents
on
which
it
*NL*
would
depend
whether
it
was
or
was
not
possible
for
her
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
and
I
'll
explain
,
''
she
began
to
Mme.
de
Gallardon
.
``
To-morrow
*NL*
evening
I
must
go
to
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
has
been
pestering
me
to
fix
*NL*
a
day
for
ages
.
If
she
takes
us
to
the
theatre
afterwards
,
then
I
ca
n't
*NL*
possibly
come
to
you
,
much
as
I
should
love
to
;
but
if
we
just
stay
in
*NL*
the
house
,
I
know
there
wo
n't
be
anyone
else
there

so
I
can
slip
away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell

have
you
seen
your
friend
M.
Swann
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Charles
!
I
never
knew
he

Where
is
he

I
must
*NL*
catch
his
eye

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
funny
thing
that
he
should
come
to
old
Saint-Euverte

''
Mme.
de
*NL*
Gallardon
went
on
.
``
Oh
,
I
know
he
's
very
clever
,
''
meaning
by
that
`
very
*NL*
cunning
,
'
``
but
that
makes
no
difference
;
fancy
a
Jew
here
,
and
she
the
*NL*
sister
and
sister-in-law
of
two
Archbishops
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
I
am
not
in
the
least
shocked

said
the
*NL*
Princesse
des
Laumes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
he
's
a
converted
Jew
,
and
all
that
,
and
his
parents
and
*NL*
grandparents
before
him
.
But
they
do
say
that
the
converted
ones
are
*NL*
worse
about
their
religion
than
the
practising
ones
,
that
it
's
all
just
*NL*
a
pretence
;
is
that
true
,
d'you
think
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
throw
no
light
at
all
on
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
pianist
,
who
was
`
down
'
to
play
two
pieces
by
Chopin
,
after
*NL*
finishing
the
Prelude
had
at
once
attacked
a
Polonaise
.
But
once
Mme.
*NL*
de
Gallardon
had
informed
her
cousin
that
Swann
was
in
the
room
,
Chopin
*NL*
himself
might
have
risen
from
the
grave
and
played
all
his
works
in
*NL*
turn
without
Mme.
des
Laumes
's
paying
him
the
slightest
attention
.
She
*NL*
belonged
to
that
one
of
the
two
divisions
of
the
human
race
in
which
the
*NL*
untiring
curiosity
which
the
other
half
feels
about
the
people
whom
it
*NL*
does
not
know
is
replaced
by
an
unfailing
interest
in
the
people
whom
it
*NL*
does
.
As
with
many
women
of
the
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
,
the
presence
,
in
*NL*
any
room
in
which
she
might
find
herself
,
of
another
member
of
her
set
,
*NL*
even
although
she
had
nothing
in
particular
to
say
to
him
,
would
occupy
*NL*
her
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
consideration
.
From
that
*NL*
moment
,
in
the
hope
that
Swann
would
catch
sight
of
her
,
the
Princess
*NL*
could
do
nothing
but
-LRB-
like
a
tame
white
mouse
when
a
lump
of
sugar
is
*NL*
put
down
before
its
nose
and
then
taken
away
-RRB-
turn
her
face
,
in
which
*NL*
were
crowded
a
thousand
signs
of
intimate
connivance
,
none
of
them
with
*NL*
the
least
relevance
to
the
sentiment
underlying
Chopin
's
music
,
in
the
*NL*
direction
where
Swann
was
,
and
,
if
he
moved
,
divert
accordingly
the
*NL*
course
of
her
magnetic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oriane
,
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
''
resumed
Mme.
de
Gallardon
,
who
could
*NL*
never
restrain
herself
from
sacrificing
her
highest
social
ambitions
,
*NL*
and
the
hope
that
she
might
one
day
emerge
into
a
light
that
would
*NL*
dazzle
the
world
,
to
the
immediate
and
secret
satisfaction
of
saying
*NL*
something
disagreeable
,
``
people
do
say
about
your
M.
Swann
that
he
's
the
*NL*
sort
of
man
one
ca
n't

in
the
house
;
is
that
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
,
of
all
people
,
ought
to
know
that
it
's
true
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
``
for
you
must
have
asked
him
a
hundred
times
,
and
*NL*
he
's
never
been

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
leaving
her
cousin
mortified
afresh
,
she
broke
out
again
into
a
*NL*
laugh
which
scandalised
everyone
who
was
trying
to
listen
to
the
music
,
*NL*
but
attracted
the
attention
of
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
,
who
had
stayed
,
*NL*
out
of
politeness
,
near
the
piano
,
and
caught
sight
of
the
Princess
now
*NL*
for
the
first
time
.
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
was
all
the
more
delighted
*NL*
to
see
Mme.
des
Laumes
,
as
she
imagined
her
to
be
still
at
Guermantes
,
*NL*
looking
after
her
father-in-law
,
who
was
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Princess
,
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
tucked
myself
away
in
a
corner
,
and
I
've
been
hearing
such
*NL*
lovely
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
've
been
in
the
room
quite
a
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
quite
a
long
time
,
which
seemed
very
short
;
it
was
only
long
*NL*
because
I
could
n't
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
offered
her
own
chair
to
the
Princess
,
who
*NL*
declined
it
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
,
no
!
Why
should
you
?
It
does
n't
matter
in
the
least
where
*NL*
I
sit
.
''
And
deliberately
picking
out
,
so
as
the
better
to
display
the
*NL*
simplicity
of
a
really
great
lady
,
a
low
seat
without
a
back
:
``
There
*NL*
now
,
that
hassock
,
that
's
all
I
want
.
It
will
make
me
keep
my
back
*NL*
straight
.
Oh
!
Good
heavens
,
I
'm
making
a
noise
again
;
they
'll
be
telling
*NL*
you
to
have
me
`
chucked
out
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
pianist
having
doubled
his
speed
,
the
emotion
of
the
*NL*
music-lovers
was
reaching
its
climax
,
a
servant
was
handing
refreshments
*NL*
about
on
a
salver
,
and
was
making
the
spoons
rattle
,
and
,
as
on
every
*NL*
other
`
party-night
'
,
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
was
making
signs
to
him
,
*NL*
which
he
never
saw
,
to
leave
the
room
.
A
recent
bride
,
who
had
been
told
*NL*
that
a
young
woman
ought
never
to
appear
bored
,
was
smiling
vigorously
,
*NL*
trying
to
catch
her
hostess
's
eye
so
as
to
flash
a
token
of
her
*NL*
gratitude
for
the
other
's
having
`
thought
of
her
'
in
connection
with
so
*NL*
delightful
an
entertainment
.
And
yet
,
although
she
remained
more
calm
*NL*
than
Mme.
de
Franquetot
,
it
was
not
without
some
uneasiness
that
she
*NL*
followed
the
flying
fingers
;
what
alarmed
her
being
not
the
pianist
's
*NL*
fate
but
the
piano
's
,
on
which
a
lighted
candle
,
jumping
at
each
*NL*
_
fortissimo
_
,
threatened
,
if
not
to
set
its
shade
on
fire
,
at
least
to
*NL*
spill
wax
upon
the
ebony
.
At
last
she
could
contain
herself
no
longer
,
*NL*
and
,
running
up
the
two
steps
of
the
platform
on
which
the
piano
stood
,
*NL*
flung
herself
on
the
candle
to
adjust
its
sconce
.
But
scarcely
had
her
*NL*
hand
come
within
reach
of
it
when
,
on
a
final
chord
,
the
piece
finished
,
*NL*
and
the
pianist
rose
to
his
feet
.
Nevertheless
the
bold
initiative
shewn
*NL*
by
this
young
woman
and
the
moment
of
blushing
confusion
between
her
*NL*
and
the
pianist
which
resulted
from
it
,
produced
an
impression
that
was
*NL*
favourable
on
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
what
that
girl
did
just
now
,
Princess
?
''
asked
General
de
*NL*
Froberville
,
who
had
come
up
to
Mme.
des
Laumes
as
her
hostess
left
her
*NL*
for
a
moment
.
``
Odd
,
was
n't
it
?
Is
she
one
of
the
performers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
's
a
little
Mme.
de
Cambremer
,
''
replied
the
Princess
carelessly
,
*NL*
and
then
,
with
more
animation
:
``
I
am
only
repeating
what
I
heard
just
*NL*
now
,
myself
;
I
have
n't
the
faintest
notion
who
said
it
,
it
was
some
one
*NL*
behind
me
who
said
that
they
were
neighbours
of
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
in
*NL*
the
country
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
anyone
knows
them
,
really
.
They
must
be
*NL*
`
country
cousins
'
!
By
the
way
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
're
particularly
*NL*
`
well-up
'
in
the
brilliant
society
which
we
see
before
us
,
because
I
've
*NL*
no
idea
who
all
these
astonishing
people
can
be
.
What
do
you
suppose
*NL*
they
do
with
themselves
when
they
're
not
at
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
*NL*
parties
?
She
must
have
ordered
them
in
with
the
musicians
and
the
chairs
*NL*
and
the
food
.
`
Universal
providers
,
'
you
know
.
You
must
admit
,
they
're
*NL*
rather
splendid
,
General
.
But
can
she
really
have
the
courage
to
hire
*NL*
the
same
`
supers
'
every
week
?
It
is
n't
possible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
Cambremer
is
quite
a
good
name
;
old
,
too
,
''
protested
the
*NL*
General
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
no
objection
to
its
being
old
,
''
the
Princess
answered
dryly
,
``
but
*NL*
whatever
else
it
is
it
's
not
euphonious
,
''
she
went
on
,
isolating
the
*NL*
word
euphonious
as
though
between
inverted
commas
,
a
little
affectation
*NL*
to
which
the
Guermantes
set
were
addicted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
not
,
eh
!
She
's
a
regular
little
peach
,
though

''
said
the
*NL*
General
,
whose
eyes
never
strayed
from
Mme.
de
Cambremer
.
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
agree
with
me
,
Princess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
thrusts
herself
forward
too
much
;
I
think
,
in
so
young
a
woman
,
*NL*
that
's
not
very
nice
--
for
I
do
n't
suppose
she
's
my
generation
,
''
replied
*NL*
Mme.
des
Laumes
-LRB-
the
last
word
being
common
,
it
appeared
,
to
Gallardon
*NL*
and
Guermantes
-RRB-
.
And
then
,
seeing
that
M.
de
Froberville
was
still
*NL*
gazing
at
Mme.
de
Cambremer
,
she
added
,
half
out
of
malice
towards
the
*NL*
lady
,
half
wishing
to
oblige
the
General
:
``
Not
very
nice
...
for
her
*NL*
husband
!
I
am
sorry
that
I
do
not
know
her
,
since
she
seems
to
attract
*NL*
you
so
much
;
I
might
have
introduced
you
to
her
,
''
said
the
Princess
,
*NL*
who
,
if
she
had
known
the
young
woman
,
would
most
probably
have
done
*NL*
nothing
of
the
sort
.
``
And
now
I
must
say
good
night
,
because
one
of
*NL*
my
friends
is
having
a
birthday
party
,
and
I
must
go
and
wish
her
many
*NL*
happy
returns
,
''
she
explained
,
modestly
and
with
truth
,
reducing
the
*NL*
fashionable
gathering
to
which
she
was
going
to
the
simple
proportions
*NL*
of
a
ceremony
which
would
be
boring
in
the
extreme
,
but
at
which
she
was
*NL*
obliged
to
be
present
,
and
there
would
be
something
touching
about
her
*NL*
appearance

``
Besides

I
must
pick
up
Basin

While
I
've
been
here

he
's
*NL*
gone
to
see
those
friends
of
his
--
you
know
them
too

I
'm
sure
,

who
are
*NL*
called
after
a
bridge

yes

the
I√©nas

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
battle
before
it
was
a
bridge

Princess

it
was
a
victory
!

*NL*
said
the
General
.
``
I
mean
to
say
,
to
an
old
soldier
like
me

he
went
*NL*
on
,
wiping
his
monocle
and
replacing
it
,
as
though
he
were
laying
*NL*
a
fresh
dressing
on
the
raw
wound
underneath
,
while
the
Princess
*NL*
instinctively
looked
away
,
``
that
Empire
nobility

well
,
of
course
,
it
's
*NL*
not
the
same
thing
,
but
,
after
all
,
taking
it
as
it
is
,
it
's
very
fine
*NL*
of
its
kind
;
they
were
people
who
really
did
fight
like
heroes

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
the
deepest
respect
for
heroes

the
Princess
assented
,
*NL*
though
with
a
faint
trace
of
irony
.
``
If
I
do

go
with
Basin
to
see
*NL*
this
Princesse
d'I√©na

it
is

for
that
,
at
all

it
's
simply
because

I
do

Basin
knows
them

he
worships
them

Oh
,
no

it
's
not
*NL*
what
you
think
;
he
's
not
in
love
with

nothing
to
set
my

against
!
Besides
,
what
good
has
it
ever
done
when
I
have
set
my
face
*NL*
against
them
?
''
she
queried
sadly
,
for
the
whole
world
knew
that
,
*NL*
ever
since
the
day
upon
which
the
Prince
des
Laumes
had
married
his
*NL*
fascinating
cousin
,
he
had
been
consistently
unfaithful
to
her
.
``
Anyhow
,
*NL*
it
is
n't
that
at
all

They
're
people

has
known
for
ever
so
long
,
they
*NL*
do
him
very
well
,
and
that
suits
me
down
to
the
ground
.
But
I
must
tell
*NL*
you
what
he
's
told
me
about
their
house
;
it
's
quite
enough
.
Can
you
*NL*
imagine
it
,
all
their
furniture
is
'Em
pire

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
Princess

that
's
only
natural
;
it
belonged
to
their
*NL*
grandparents

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite

I
*NL*
quite
understand
that
people

always
have
nice
things

at

*NL*
they
need
n't
have
things
that
are
merely
grotesque

What
do
you
say
?
*NL*
I
can
think
of
nothing
more
devastating

more
utterly
smug
than
that

hideous
style

cabinets
covered

over
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
believe

all
the

that
they

some
lovely
things

must
have
that
famous
mosaic

*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
deny

they
may
have
things

are
interesting
enough

from
the
historic
point
of
view

But
things
like
that
ca

ever

be
*NL*
beautiful

because
they
're
simply
horrible
!
I
've
got
things
like
that
*NL*
myself
,
that
came
to
Basin
from
the
Montesquious
.
Only
,
they
're
up
in

the
attics
at
Guermantes
,
where
nobody
ever
sees
them

But
,
after

*NL*
that

not
the

I
would
fly

their
sphinxes

assumed
a
tone
of
childish
gravity

so
I
am
just
doing

strange

get
a

hostile

*NL*
*NL*
And
she
coquettishly
enhanced
the
charm
of
the
smile
which
the
idea
had
*NL*
brought
to
her
lips
,
by
giving
to
her
blue
eyes
,
which
were
fixed
on
the
*NL*
General
,
a
gentle
,
dreamy
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

wild
with
joy

``
No

''
she
inquired
,
with
the
utmost
vivacity
,
either
so
as
to
seem
*NL*
unaware
that
it
would
be
because
she
was
one
of
the
first
ladies
in
*NL*
France
,
or
so
as
to
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
General
tell
*NL*
her
so
.
``
Why
?
How
can
you
tell
?
Perhaps
they
would
think
it
the
most
*NL*
unpleasant
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
.
I
know
nothing
about
them
,
*NL*
but
if
they
're
anything
like
me
,
I
find
it
quite
boring
enough

people
I
do

I

sure

Besides

except
when
it
's
an
old
friend

you

whom
one
knows
quite
*NL*
apart
from
that
,
I
'm
not
sure
that
`
heroism

takes
one
very
far
in
*NL*
society

It
's
often
quite
boring
enough
to
have
to
give
a
dinner-party
,
*NL*

if
one
had
to
offer
one
's
arm
to
Spartacus
,
to
let
him
take
one
*NL*
down
...
!
Really
,
no
;
it
would
never
be
Vercingetorix
I
should
send
for
,
*NL*
to
make
a
fourteenth

I
feel
sure
,
I
should
keep
him
for
really
big
*NL*
`
crushes

as
I
never
give
any

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Princess

it
's
easy
to
see
you

nothing

have
your
share

all
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
But

always
talk

make
out

you
really
know
any
others

she
rallied
*NL*
him
,
with
a
rippling
flow
of
laughter
,
her
features
concentrated
,
yoked
*NL*
to
the
service
of
her
animation
,
her
eyes
sparkling

blazing
with
*NL*
a
radiant
sunshine
of
gaiety
which
could
be
kindled
only
by
such
*NL*
speeches

even
if
the
Princess
had
to
make
them
herself

were
in

praise

of
her
beauty

*NL*
``
Did

notice

asked
the

*NL*
*NL*
Swann
was
extremely
fond
of
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
and
the
sight
of
*NL*
her
recalled
to
him
Guermantes
,
a
property
close
to
Combray
,
and
all
*NL*
that
country
which
he
so
dearly
loved
and
had
ceased
to
visit
,
so
as
not
*NL*
to
be
separated
from
Odette

Slipping
into
the
manner
,
half-artistic
,
*NL*
half-amorous
--
with
which
he
could
always
manage
to
amuse
the
Princess
--
a
*NL*
manner
which
came
to
him
quite
naturally
whenever
he
dipped
for
a
moment
*NL*
into
the
old
social
atmosphere
,
and
wishing
also
to
express
in
words
,
*NL*
for
his
own
satisfaction
,
the
longing
that
he
felt
for
the
country
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
or
rather
intoned
,
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
audible
at
*NL*
once
to
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
,
to
whom
he
spoke
,
and
to
Mme.
des
Laumes
,
*NL*
for
whom
he
was
speaking
,
``
Behold
our
charming
Princess

she
has

come
up
on
purpose

Guermantes
to
hear
Saint
Francis
preach
to
the
*NL*
birds
,
and
has
only
just
had
time
,
like
a
dear
little
tit-mouse
,
to
go
*NL*
and
pick
a
few
little
hips
and
haws
and
put
them
in
her
hair
;
there
are
*NL*
even
some
drops
of
dew
upon
them
still

a
little
of
the
hoar-frost

must
be
making
the

*NL*
``
What
!
The
Princess
came
up
on
purpose

that
's
too
*NL*
wonderful

never
knew

I

quite
bewildered

Mme.

Saint-Euverte
*NL*
protested
with
quaint
simplicity
,
being
but
little
accustomed
to
Swann

*NL*
way
of
speaking

And
then
,
examining
the
Princess
's
headdress
,
*NL*
``
Why

you
're
quite
right

it
is
copied
from

what
shall
I

not

,
no
,
--
oh
,
it
's
a
delightful
idea

how
can
the

*NL*
have
known
what
was
going
to
be
on
my
programme

The
musicians
did
n't
*NL*
tell
me
,
even

*NL*
*NL*
Swann
,
who
was
accustomed
,
when
he
was
with
a
woman
whom
he
had
kept
*NL*
up
the
habit
of
addressing
in
terms
of
gallantry
,
to
pay
her
delicate
*NL*
compliments
which
most
other
people
would
not
and
need
not
understand
,
*NL*
did
not
condescend
to
explain
to
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
that
he
had
*NL*
been
speaking
metaphorically
.
As
for
the
Princess
,
she
was
in
fits
of
*NL*
laughter
,
both
because
Swann
's
wit
was
highly
appreciated
by
her
set
,
*NL*
and
because
she
could
never
hear
a
compliment
addressed
to
herself
*NL*
without
finding
it
exquisitely
subtle
and
irresistibly
amusing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
I
'm
delighted

you
bow
to

*NL*
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
,
seeing
that
the
Princess
seemed
quite
happy
*NL*
talking
to
Swann

had
drifted
away

``

yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

not
the
Cambremers

her
own
people

She
was
a
Legrandin
,
and
used

to
come
to
Combray
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
are
aware

you
are

Comtesse

that
the

*NL*
*NL*

I
do

know
what
the

I
do
know
that

touched

*NL*
for
a
hundred
francs
,
every
year
,
by
the
Cur√©
,
which
is
a
due
that
I
*NL*
could
very
well
do
without
.
But
surely
these
Cambremers
have
rather
a
*NL*
startling
name
.
It
ends
just
in
time
,
but
it
ends
badly
!
''
she
said
with
*NL*
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
begins
no
better

''
Swann
took
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
double
abbreviation
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
very
angry
and
very
proper
who
did
n't
dare
to
finish
the
first
*NL*
word

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
since
he
could
n't
stop
himself
beginning
the
second

he
'd
have
done
*NL*
better
to
finish
the
first
and
be
done
with
it
.
We
are
indulging
in
*NL*
the
most
refined
form
of
humour
,
my
dear
Charles
,
in
the
very
best
of
*NL*
taste
--
but
how
tiresome
it
is
that
I
never
see
you
now
,
''
she
went
on
in
*NL*
a
coaxing
tone
,
``
I
do
so
love
talking
to
you
.
Just
imagine
,
I
could
not
*NL*
make
that
idiot
Froberville
see
that
there
was
anything
funny
about
the
*NL*
name
Cambremer
.
Do
agree
that
life
is
a
dreadful
business
.
It
's
only
*NL*
when
I
see
you
that
I
stop
feeling
bored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
was
probably
not
true
.
But
Swann
and
the
Princess
had
the
same
way
*NL*
of
looking
at
the
little
things
of
life
--
the
effect
,
if
not
the
cause
of
*NL*
which
was
a
close
analogy
between
their
modes
of
expression
and
even
of
*NL*
pronunciation
.
This
similarity
was
not
striking
because
no
two
things
*NL*
could
have
been
more
unlike
than
their
voices
.
But
if
one
took
the
*NL*
trouble
to
imagine
Swann
's
utterances
divested
of
the
sonority
that
*NL*
enwrapped
them
,
of
the
moustache
from
under
which
they
emerged
,
one
*NL*
found
that
they
were
the
same
phrases
,
the
same
inflexions
,
that
they
*NL*
had
the
`
tone
'
of
the
Guermantes
set
.
On
important
matters
,
Swann
and
*NL*
the
Princess
had
not
an
idea
in
common
.
But
since
Swann
had
become
so
*NL*
melancholy
,
and
was
always
in
that
trembling
condition
which
precedes
*NL*
a
flood
of
tears
,
he
had
the
same
need
to
speak
about
his
grief
that
*NL*
a
murderer
has
to
tell
some
one
about
his
crime
.
And
when
he
heard
*NL*
the
Princess
say
that
life
was
a
dreadful
business
,
he
felt
as
much
*NL*
comforted
as
if
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
Odette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
life
is
a
dreadful
business

We
must
meet
more
often

*NL*
friend

What
is
so
nice
about
you
is
that
you
are
not
cheerful

We
could
*NL*
spend
a
most
pleasant
evening
together

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
we
could

why

wild
with
joy
.
It
's
supposed
to
be
very
ugly
down
there
,
but
*NL*
I
must
say
,
I
find
the
neighborhood
not
at
all
unattractive
;
I
have
a
*NL*
horror
of
`
picturesque
spots
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
well
,
it
's
delightful
!
''
replied
Swann
.
``
It
's
almost
too
*NL*
beautiful
,
too
much
alive
for
me
just
at
present
;
it
's
a
country
to
*NL*
be
happy
in
.
It
's
perhaps
because
I
have
lived
there
,
but
things
there
*NL*
speak
to
me
so
.
As
soon
as
a
breath
of
wind
gets
up
,
and
the
cornfields
*NL*
begin
to
stir
,
I
feel
that
some
one
is
going
to
appear
suddenly
,
that
*NL*
I
am
going
to
hear
some
news
;
and
those
little
houses
by
the
water
's
*NL*
edge
...
I
should
be
quite
wretched
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
my
dearest
Charles
,
do
take
care
;
there
's
that
appalling
Rampillon
*NL*
woman
;
she
's
seen
me
;
hide
me
somewhere
,
do
tell
me
again
,
quickly
,
what
*NL*
it
was
that
happened
to
her
;
I
get
so
mixed
up
;
she
's
just
married
off
*NL*
her
daughter
,
or
her
lover
-LRB-
I
never
can
remember
-RRB-
,
--
perhaps
both
--
to
*NL*
each
other
!
Oh
,
no
,
I
remember
now
,
she
's
been
dropped
by
her
Prince

*NL*
Pretend
to
be
talking
,
so
that
the
poor
old
Berenice
sha
'n'
t
come
and
*NL*
invite
me
to
dinner
.
Anyhow
,
I
'm
going
.
Listen
,
my
dearest
Charles
,
now
*NL*
that
I
have
seen
you
,
once
in
a
blue
moon
,
wo
n't
you
let
me
carry
you
*NL*
off
and
take
you
to
the
Princesse
de
Parme

,
who
would
be
so
pleased
*NL*
to
see
you
-LRB-
you
know
-RRB-
,
and
Basin
too
,
for
that
matter
;
he
's
meeting
me
*NL*
there
.
If
one
did
n't
get
news
of
you
,
sometimes
,
from
M√©m√©
...
Remember
,
*NL*
I
never
see
you
at
all
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
declined
.
Having
told
M.
de
Charlus
that
,
on
leaving
Mme.
de
*NL*
Saint-Euverte
's
,
he
would
go
straight
home
,
he
did
not
care
to
run
the
*NL*
risk
,
by
going
on
now
to
the
Princesse
de
Parme
's
,
of
missing
a
message
*NL*
which
he
had
,
all
the
time
,
been
hoping
to
see
brought
in
to
him
by
one
*NL*
of
the
footmen
,
during
the
party
,
and
which
he
was
perhaps
going
to
find
*NL*
left
with
his
own
porter
,
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Swann
,
''
said
Mme.
des
Laumes
that
night
to
her
husband
;
``
he
is
*NL*
always
charming
,
but
he
does
look
so
dreadfully
unhappy
.
You
will
see
*NL*
for
yourself
,
for
he
has
promised
to
dine
with
us
one
of
these
days
.
I
*NL*
do
feel
that
it
's
really
absurd
that
a
man
of
his
intelligence
should
*NL*
let
himself
be
made
to
suffer
by
a
creature
of
that
kind
,
who
is
n't
even
*NL*
interesting
,
for
they
tell
me
,
she
's
an
absolute
idiot
!
''
she
concluded
*NL*
with
the
wisdom
invariably
shewn
by
people
who
,
not
being
in
love
*NL*
themselves
,
feel
that
a
clever
man
ought
to
be
unhappy
only
about
such
*NL*
persons
as
are
worth
his
while
;
which
is
rather
like
being
astonished
*NL*
that
anyone
should
condescend
to
die
of
cholera
at
the
bidding
of
so
*NL*
insignificant
a
creature
as
the
common
bacillus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
now
wished
to
go
home
,
but
,
just
as
he
was
making
his
escape
,
*NL*
General
de
Froberville
caught
him
and
asked
for
an
introduction
to
Mme.
*NL*
de
Cambremer
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
go
back
into
the
room
to
look
for
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Swann
,
I
'd
rather
be
married
to
that
little
woman
than
killed
by
*NL*
savages
,
what
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
`
killed
by
savages
'
pierced
Swann
's
aching
heart
;
and
at
once
*NL*
he
felt
the
need
of
continuing
the
conversation
.
``
Ah
!
''
he
began
,
``
some
*NL*
fine
lives
have
been
lost
in
that
way
...
There
was
,
you
remember
,
that
*NL*
explorer
whose
remains
Dumont
d'Urville
brought
back
,
La
P√©rouse
...
''
*NL*
-LRB-
and
he
was
at
once
happy
again
,
as
though
he
had
named
Odette
-RRB-
.
``
He
was
*NL*
a
fine
character
,
and
interests
me
very
much
,
does
La
P√©rouse
,
''
he
ended
*NL*
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
of
course
,
La
P√©rouse
,
''
said
the
General
.
``
It
's
quite
a
*NL*
well-known
name
.
There
's
a
street
called
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
anyone
in
the
Rue
La
P√©rouse
?
''
asked
Swann
excitedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
Mme.
de
Chanlivault
,
the
sister
of
that
good
fellow
Chaussepierre
.
*NL*
She
gave
a
most
amusing
theatre-party
the
other
evening
.
That
's
a
house
*NL*
that
will
be
really
smart
some
day
,
you
'll
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
so
she
lives
in
the
Rue
La
P√©rouse
.
It
's
attractive
;
I
like
that
*NL*
street
;
it
's
so
sombre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
it
is
n't
.
You
ca
n't
have
been
in
it
for
a
long
time
;
it
's
not
at
*NL*
all
sombre
now
;
they
're
beginning
to
build
all
round
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Swann
did
finally
introduce
M.
de
Froberville
to
the
young
Mme.
de
*NL*
Cambremer
,
since
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
heard
the
General
's
*NL*
name
,
she
hastily
outlined
upon
her
lips
the
smile
of
joy
and
surprise
*NL*
with
which
she
would
have
greeted
him
if
she
had
never
,
in
the
whole
*NL*
of
her
life
,
heard
anything
else
;
for
,
as
she
did
not
yet
know
all
the
*NL*
friends
of
her
new
family
,
whenever
anyone
was
presented
to
her
,
she
*NL*
assumed
that
he
must
be
one
of
them
,
and
thinking
that
she
would
shew
*NL*
her
tact
by
appearing
to
have
heard
`
such
a
lot
about
him
'
since
her
*NL*
marriage
,
she
would
hold
out
her
hand
with
an
air
of
hesitation
which
*NL*
was
meant
as
a
proof
at
once
of
the
inculcated
reserve
which
she
had
to
*NL*
overcome
and
of
the
spontaneous
friendliness
which
successfully
overcame
*NL*
it
.
And
so
her
parents-in-law
,
whom
she
still
regarded
as
the
most
*NL*
eminent
pair
in
France
,
declared
that
she
was
an
angel
;
all
the
more
*NL*
that
they
preferred
to
appear
,
in
marrying
her
to
their
son
,
to
have
*NL*
yielded
to
the
attraction
rather
of
her
natural
charm
than
of
her
*NL*
considerable
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
easy
to
see
that
you
're
a
musician
heart
and
soul
,
Madame
,
''
said
*NL*
the
General
,
alluding
to
the
incident
of
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
concert
had
begun
again
,
and
Swann
saw
that
he
could
not
*NL*
now
go
before
the
end
of
the
new
number
.
He
suffered
greatly
from
being
*NL*
shut
up
among
all
these
people
whose
stupidity
and
absurdities
wounded
*NL*
him
all
the
more
cruelly
since
,
being
ignorant
of
his
love
,
incapable
,
*NL*
had
they
known
of
it
,
of
taking
any
interest
,
or
of
doing
more
than
*NL*
smile
at
it
as
at
some
childish
joke
,
or
deplore
it
as
an
act
of
*NL*
insanity
,
they
made
it
appear
to
him
in
the
aspect
of
a
subjective
*NL*
state
which
existed
for
himself
alone
,
whose
reality
there
was
nothing
*NL*
external
to
confirm
;
he
suffered
overwhelmingly
,
to
the
point
at
which
*NL*
even
the
sound
of
the
instruments
made
him
want
to
cry
,
from
having
to
*NL*
prolong
his
exile
in
this
place
to
which
Odette
would
never
come
,
in
*NL*
which
no
one
,
nothing
was
aware
of
her
existence
,
from
which
she
was
*NL*
entirely
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
suddenly
it
was
as
though
she
had
entered
,
and
this
apparition
tore
*NL*
him
with
such
anguish
that
his
hand
rose
impulsively
to
his
heart
.
What
*NL*
had
happened
was
that
the
violin
had
risen
to
a
series
of
high
notes
,
*NL*
on
which
it
rested
as
though
expecting
something
,
an
expectancy
which
*NL*
it
prolonged
without
ceasing
to
hold
on
to
the
notes
,
in
the
exaltation
*NL*
with
which
it
already
saw
the
expected
object
approaching
,
and
with
a
*NL*
desperate
effort
to
continue
until
its
arrival
,
to
welcome
it
before
*NL*
itself
expired
,
to
keep
the
way
open
for
a
moment
longer
,
with
all
its
*NL*
remaining
strength
,
that
the
stranger
might
enter
in
,
as
one
holds
a
*NL*
door
open
that
would
otherwise
automatically
close
.
And
before
Swann
had
*NL*
had
time
to
understand
what
was
happening
,
to
think
:
``
It
is
the
little
*NL*
phrase
from
Vinteuil
's
sonata
.
I
must
n't
listen
!
''
,
all
his
memories
of
*NL*
the
days
when
Odette
had
been
in
love
with
him
,
which
he
had
succeeded
,
*NL*
up
till
that
evening
,
in
keeping
invisible
in
the
depths
of
his
being
,
*NL*
deceived
by
this
sudden
reflection
of
a
season
of
love
,
whose
sun
,
they
*NL*
supposed
,
had
dawned
again
,
had
awakened
from
their
slumber
,
had
taken
*NL*
wing
and
risen
to
sing
maddeningly
in
his
ears
,
without
pity
for
his
*NL*
present
desolation
,
the
forgotten
strains
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
place
of
the
abstract
expressions
``
the
time
when
I
was
happy
,
''
``
the
*NL*
time
when
I
was
loved
,
''
which
he
had
often
used
until
then
,
and
without
*NL*
much
suffering
,
for
his
intelligence
had
not
embodied
in
them
anything
*NL*
of
the
past
save
fictitious
extracts
which
preserved
none
of
the
*NL*
reality
,
he
now
recovered
everything
that
had
fixed
unalterably
the
*NL*
peculiar
,
volatile
essence
of
that
lost
happiness
;
he
could
see
it
all
;
*NL*
the
snowy
,
curled
petals
of
the
chrysanthemum
which
she
had
tossed
*NL*
after
him
into
his
carriage
,
which
he
had
kept
pressed
to
his
lips
,
the
*NL*
address
`
Maison
Dor√©e
,
'
embossed
on
the
note-paper
on
which
he
had
read
*NL*
``
My
hand
trembles
so
as
I
write
to
you
,
''
the
frowning
contraction
of
her
*NL*
eyebrows
when
she
said
pleadingly
:
``
You
wo
n't
let
it
be
very
long
before
*NL*
you
send
for
me
?
''
;
he
could
smell
the
heated
iron
of
the
barber
whom
he
*NL*
used
to
have
in
to
singe
his
hair
while
Loredan
went
to
fetch
the
little
*NL*
working
girl
;
could
feel
the
torrents
of
rain
which
fell
so
often
that
*NL*
spring
,
the
ice-cold
homeward
drive
in
his
victoria
,
by
moonlight
;
all
*NL*
the
network
of
mental
habits
,
of
seasonable
impressions
,
of
sensory
*NL*
reactions
,
which
had
extended
over
a
series
of
weeks
its
uniform
meshes
,
*NL*
by
which
his
body
now
found
itself
inextricably
held
.
At
that
time
he
*NL*
had
been
satisfying
a
sensual
curiosity
to
know
what
were
the
pleasures
*NL*
of
those
people
who
lived
for
love
alone
.
He
had
supposed
that
he
could
*NL*
stop
there
,
that
he
would
not
be
obliged
to
learn
their
sorrows
also
;
*NL*
how
small
a
thing
the
actual
charm
of
Odette
was
now
in
comparison
with
*NL*
that
formidable
terror
which
extended
it
like
a
cloudy
halo
all
around
*NL*
her
,
that
enormous
anguish
of
not
knowing
at
every
hour
of
the
day
and
*NL*
night
what
she
had
been
doing
,
of
not
possessing
her
wholly
,
at
all
*NL*
times
and
in
all
places
!
Alas
,
he
recalled
the
accents
in
which
she
had
*NL*
exclaimed
:
``
But
I
can
see
you
at
any
time
;
I
am
always
free
!
''
--
she
,
who
*NL*
was
never
free
now
;
the
interest
,
the
curiosity
that
she
had
shewn
in
*NL*
his
life
,
her
passionate
desire
that
he
should
do
her
the
favour
--
of
*NL*
which
it
was
he
who
,
then
,
had
felt
suspicious
,
as
of
a
possibly
tedious
*NL*
waste
of
his
time
and
disturbance
of
his
arrangements
--
of
granting
her
*NL*
access
to
his
study
;
how
she
had
been
obliged
to
beg
that
he
would
let
*NL*
her
take
him
to
the
Verdurins
'
;
and
,
when
he
did
allow
her
to
come
to
*NL*
him
once
a
month
,
how
she
had
first
,
before
he
would
let
himself
be
*NL*
swayed
,
had
to
repeat
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
her
,
that
custom
of
*NL*
their
seeing
each
other
daily
,
for
which
she
had
longed
at
a
time
when
*NL*
to
him
it
had
seemed
only
a
tiresome
distraction
,
for
which
,
since
that
*NL*
time
,
she
had
conceived
a
distaste
and
had
definitely
broken
herself
*NL*
of
it
,
while
it
had
become
for
him
so
insatiable
,
so
dolorous
a
need
.
*NL*
Little
had
he
suspected
how
truly
he
spoke
when
,
on
their
third
meeting
,
*NL*
as
she
repeated
:
``
But
why
do
n't
you
let
me
come
to
you
oftener
?
''
he
had
*NL*
told
her
,
laughing
,
and
in
a
vein
of
gallantry
,
that
it
was
for
fear
of
*NL*
forming
a
hopeless
passion
.
Now
,
alas
,
it
still
happened
at
times
that
*NL*
she
wrote
to
him
from
a
restaurant
or
hotel
,
on
paper
which
bore
a
*NL*
printed
address
,
but
printed
in
letters
of
fire
that
seared
his
heart
.
*NL*
``
Written
from
the
H√¥tel
Vouillemont
.
What
on
earth
can
she
have
gone
*NL*
there
for
?
With
whom
?
What
happened
there
?
''
He
remembered
the
gas-jets
*NL*
that
were
being
extinguished
along
the
Boulevard
des
Italiens
when
he
*NL*
had
met
her
,
when
all
hope
was
gone
among
the
errant
shades
upon
that
*NL*
night
which
had
seemed
to
him
almost
supernatural
and
which
now
-LRB-
that
*NL*
night
of
a
period
when
he
had
not
even
to
ask
himself
whether
he
would
*NL*
be
annoying
her
by
looking
for
her
and
by
finding
her
,
so
certain
was
he
*NL*
that
she
knew
no
greater
happiness
than
to
see
him
and
to
let
him
take
*NL*
her
home
-RRB-
belonged
indeed
to
a
mysterious
world
to
which
one
never
may
*NL*
return
again
once
its
doors
are
closed
.
And
Swann
could
distinguish
,
*NL*
standing
,
motionless
,
before
that
scene
of
happiness
in
which
it
lived
*NL*
again
,
a
wretched
figure
which
filled
him
with
such
pity
,
because
he
*NL*
did
not
at
first
recognise
who
it
was
,
that
he
must
lower
his
head
,
*NL*
lest
anyone
should
observe
that
his
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
.
It
was
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
realised
this
,
his
pity
ceased
;
he
was
jealous
,
now
,
of
that
*NL*
other
self
whom
she
had
loved
,
he
was
jealous
of
those
men
of
whom
he
*NL*
had
so
often
said
,
without
much
suffering
:
``
Perhaps
she
's
in
love
with
*NL*
them
,
''
now
that
he
had
exchanged
the
vague
idea
of
loving
,
in
*NL*
which
there
is
no
love
,
for
the
petals
of
the
chrysanthemum
and
the
*NL*
`
letter-heading
'
of
the
Maison
d'Or
;
for
they
were
full
of
love
.
*NL*
And
then
,
his
anguish
becoming
too
keen
,
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
*NL*
forehead
,
let
the
monocle
drop
from
his
eye
,
and
wiped
its
glass
.
And
*NL*
doubtless
,
if
he
had
caught
sight
of
himself
at
that
moment
,
he
would
*NL*
have
added
to
the
collection
of
the
monocles
which
he
had
already
*NL*
identified
,
this
one
which
he
removed
,
like
an
importunate
,
worrying
*NL*
thought
,
from
his
head
,
while
from
its
misty
surface
,
with
his
*NL*
handkerchief
,
he
sought
to
obliterate
his
cares
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
in
the
music
of
the
violin
--
if
one
does
not
see
the
instrument
*NL*
itself
,
and
so
can
not
relate
what
one
hears
to
its
form
,
which
modifies
*NL*
the
fullness
of
the
sound
--
accents
which
are
so
closely
akin
to
those
*NL*
of
certain
contralto
voices
,
that
one
has
the
illusion
that
a
singer
has
*NL*
taken
her
place
amid
the
orchestra
.
One
raises
one
's
eyes
;
one
sees
only
*NL*
the
wooden
case
,
magical
as
a
Chinese
box
;
but
,
at
moments
,
one
is
*NL*
still
tricked
by
the
deceiving
appeal
of
the
Siren
;
at
times
,
too
,
one
*NL*
believes
that
one
is
listening
to
a
captive
spirit
,
struggling
in
the
*NL*
darkness
of
its
masterful
box
,
a
box
quivering
with
enchantment
,
like
a
*NL*
devil
immersed
in
a
stoup
of
holy
water
;
sometimes
,
again
,
it
is
in
the
*NL*
air
,
at
large
,
like
a
pure
and
supernatural
creature
that
reveals
to
the
*NL*
ear
,
as
it
passes
,
its
invisible
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
though
the
musicians
were
not
nearly
so
much
playing
the
little
*NL*
phrase
as
performing
the
rites
on
which
it
insisted
before
it
would
*NL*
consent
to
appear
,
as
proceeding
to
utter
the
incantations
necessary
*NL*
to
procure
,
and
to
prolong
for
a
few
moments
,
the
miracle
of
its
*NL*
apparition
,
Swann
,
who
was
no
more
able
now
to
see
it
than
if
it
had
*NL*
belonged
to
a
world
of
ultra-violet
light
,
who
experienced
something
*NL*
like
the
refreshing
sense
of
a
metamorphosis
in
the
momentary
blindness
*NL*
with
which
he
had
been
struck
as
he
approached
it
,
Swann
felt
that
it
*NL*
was
present
,
like
a
protective
goddess
,
a
confidant
of
his
love
,
who
,
so
*NL*
as
to
be
able
to
come
to
him
through
the
crowd
,
and
to
draw
him
aside
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
,
had
disguised
herself
in
this
sweeping
cloak
of
sound
.
And
*NL*
as
she
passed
him
,
light
,
soothing
,
as
softly
murmured
as
the
perfume
*NL*
of
a
flower
,
telling
him
what
she
had
to
say
,
every
word
of
which
*NL*
he
closely
scanned
,
sorry
to
see
them
fly
away
so
fast
,
he
made
*NL*
involuntarily
with
his
lips
the
motion
of
kissing
,
as
it
went
by
him
,
*NL*
the
harmonious
,
fleeting
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
was
no
longer
in
exile
and
alone
since
she
,
who
*NL*
addressed
herself
to
him
,
spoke
to
him
in
a
whisper
of
Odette
.
For
he
*NL*
had
no
longer
,
as
of
old
,
the
impression
that
Odette
and
he
were
not
*NL*
known
to
the
little
phrase
.
Had
it
not
often
been
the
witness
of
their
*NL*
joys
?
True
that
,
as
often
,
it
had
warned
him
of
their
frailty
.
And
*NL*
indeed
,
whereas
,
in
that
distant
time
,
he
had
divined
an
element
of
*NL*
suffering
in
its
smile
,
in
its
limpid
and
disillusioned
intonation
,
*NL*
to-night
he
found
there
rather
the
charm
of
a
resignation
that
was
*NL*
almost
gay
.
Of
those
sorrows
,
of
which
the
little
phrase
had
spoken
*NL*
to
him
then
,
which
he
had
seen
it
--
without
his
being
touched
by
them
*NL*
himself
--
carry
past
him
,
smiling
,
on
its
sinuous
and
rapid
course
,
of
*NL*
those
sorrows
which
were
now
become
his
own
,
without
his
having
any
hope
*NL*
of
being
,
ever
,
delivered
from
them
,
it
seemed
to
say
to
him
,
as
once
*NL*
it
had
said
of
his
happiness
:
``
What
does
all
that
matter
;
it
is
all
*NL*
nothing
.
''
And
Swann
's
thoughts
were
borne
for
the
first
time
on
a
wave
*NL*
of
pity
and
tenderness
towards
that
Vinteuil
,
towards
that
unknown
,
*NL*
exalted
brother
who
also
must
have
suffered
so
greatly
;
what
could
his
*NL*
life
have
been
?
From
the
depths
of
what
well
of
sorrow
could
he
have
*NL*
drawn
that
god-like
strength
,
that
unlimited
power
of
creation
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
was
the
little
phrase
that
spoke
to
him
of
the
vanity
of
his
*NL*
sufferings
,
Swann
found
a
sweetness
in
that
very
wisdom
which
,
but
a
*NL*
little
while
back
,
had
seemed
to
him
intolerable
when
he
thought
that
*NL*
he
could
read
it
on
the
faces
of
indifferent
strangers
,
who
would
regard
*NL*
his
love
as
a
digression
that
was
without
importance
.
'T
was
because
the
*NL*
little
phrase
,
unlike
them
,
whatever
opinion
it
might
hold
on
the
short
*NL*
duration
of
these
states
of
the
soul
,
saw
in
them
something
not
,
as
*NL*
everyone
else
saw
,
less
serious
than
the
events
of
everyday
life
,
but
,
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
so
far
superior
to
everyday
life
as
to
be
alone
worthy
*NL*
of
the
trouble
of
expressing
it
.
Those
graces
of
an
intimate
sorrow
,
*NL*
't
was
them
that
the
phrase
endeavoured
to
imitate
,
to
create
anew
;
and
*NL*
even
their
essence
,
for
all
that
it
consists
in
being
incommunicable
and
*NL*
in
appearing
trivial
to
everyone
save
him
who
has
experience
of
them
,
*NL*
the
little
phrase
had
captured
,
had
rendered
visible
.
So
much
so
that
it
*NL*
made
their
value
be
confessed
,
their
divine
sweetness
be
tasted
by
*NL*
all
those
same
onlookers
--
provided
only
that
they
were
in
any
sense
*NL*
musical
--
who
,
the
next
moment
,
would
ignore
,
would
disown
them
in
real
*NL*
life
,
in
every
individual
love
that
came
into
being
beneath
their
eyes
.
*NL*
Doubtless
the
form
in
which
it
had
codified
those
graces
could
not
be
*NL*
analysed
into
any
logical
elements
.
But
ever
since
,
more
than
a
year
*NL*
before
,
discovering
to
him
many
of
the
riches
of
his
own
soul
,
the
love
*NL*
of
music
had
been
born
,
and
for
a
time
at
least
had
dwelt
in
him
,
Swann
*NL*
had
regarded
musical
_
motifs
_
as
actual
ideas
,
of
another
world
,
of
*NL*
another
order
,
ideas
veiled
in
shadows
,
unknown
,
impenetrable
by
*NL*
the
human
mind
,
which
none
the
less
were
perfectly
distinct
one
from
*NL*
another
,
unequal
among
themselves
in
value
and
in
significance
.
When
,
*NL*
after
that
first
evening
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
he
had
had
the
little
*NL*
phrase
played
over
to
him
again
,
and
had
sought
to
disentangle
from
his
*NL*
confused
impressions
how
it
was
that
,
like
a
perfume
or
a
caress
,
*NL*
it
swept
over
and
enveloped
him
,
he
had
observed
that
it
was
to
the
*NL*
closeness
of
the
intervals
between
the
five
notes
which
composed
it
and
*NL*
to
the
constant
repetition
of
two
of
them
that
was
due
that
impression
*NL*
of
a
frigid
,
a
contracted
sweetness
;
but
in
reality
he
knew
that
he
*NL*
was
basing
this
conclusion
not
upon
the
phrase
itself
,
but
merely
upon
*NL*
certain
equivalents
,
substituted
-LRB-
for
his
mind
's
convenience
-RRB-
for
the
*NL*
mysterious
entity
of
which
he
had
become
aware
,
before
ever
he
knew
the
*NL*
Verdurins
,
at
that
earlier
party
,
when
for
the
first
time
he
had
heard
*NL*
the
sonata
played
.
He
knew
that
his
memory
of
the
piano
falsified
still
*NL*
further
the
perspective
in
which
he
saw
the
music
,
that
the
field
*NL*
open
to
the
musician
is
not
a
miserable
stave
of
seven
notes
,
but
an
*NL*
immeasurable
keyboard
-LRB-
still
,
almost
all
of
it
,
unknown
-RRB-
,
on
which
,
*NL*
here
and
there
only
,
separated
by
the
gross
darkness
of
its
unexplored
*NL*
tracts
,
some
few
among
the
millions
of
keys
,
keys
of
tenderness
,
of
*NL*
passion
,
of
courage
,
of
serenity
,
which
compose
it
,
each
one
differing
*NL*
from
all
the
rest
as
one
universe
differs
from
another
,
have
been
*NL*
discovered
by
certain
great
artists
who
do
us
the
service
,
when
they
*NL*
awaken
in
us
the
emotion
corresponding
to
the
theme
which
they
have
*NL*
found
,
of
shewing
us
what
richness
,
what
variety
lies
hidden
,
unknown
to
*NL*
us
,
in
that
great
black
impenetrable
night
,
discouraging
exploration
,
*NL*
of
our
soul
,
which
we
have
been
content
to
regard
as
valueless
and
*NL*
waste
and
void
.
Vinteuil
had
been
one
of
those
musicians
.
In
his
little
*NL*
phrase
,
albeit
it
presented
to
the
mind
's
eye
a
clouded
surface
,
there
*NL*
was
contained
,
one
felt
,
a
matter
so
consistent
,
so
explicit
,
to
which
*NL*
the
phrase
gave
so
new
,
so
original
a
force
,
that
those
who
had
once
*NL*
heard
it
preserved
the
memory
of
it
in
the
treasure-chamber
of
*NL*
their
minds
.
Swann
would
repair
to
it
as
to
a
conception
of
love
and
*NL*
happiness
,
of
which
at
once
he
knew
as
well
in
what
respects
it
was
*NL*
peculiar
as
he
would
know
of
the
_
Princesse
de
Cl√®ves
_
,
or
of
_
Ren√©
_
,
*NL*
should
either
of
those
titles
occur
to
him
.
Even
when
he
was
not
*NL*
thinking
of
the
little
phrase
,
it
existed
,
latent
,
in
his
mind
,
in
the
*NL*
same
way
as
certain
other
conceptions
without
material
equivalent
,
such
*NL*
as
our
notions
of
light
,
of
sound
,
of
perspective
,
of
bodily
desire
,
the
*NL*
rich
possessions
wherewith
our
inner
temple
is
diversified
and
adorned
.
*NL*
Perhaps
we
shall
lose
them
,
perhaps
they
will
be
obliterated
,
if
we
*NL*
return
to
nothing
in
the
dust
.
But
so
long
as
we
are
alive
,
we
can
no
*NL*
more
bring
ourselves
to
a
state
in
which
we
shall
not
have
known
*NL*
them
than
we
can
with
regard
to
any
material
object
,
than
we
can
,
for
*NL*
example
,
doubt
the
luminosity
of
a
lamp
that
has
just
been
lighted
,
in
*NL*
view
of
the
changed
aspect
of
everything
in
the
room
,
from
which
has
*NL*
vanished
even
the
memory
of
the
darkness
.
In
that
way
Vinteuil
's
phrase
,
*NL*
like
some
theme
,
say
,
in
_
Tristan
_
,
which
represents
to
us
also
a
*NL*
certain
acquisition
of
sentiment
,
has
espoused
our
mortal
state
,
had
*NL*
endued
a
vesture
of
humanity
that
was
affecting
enough
.
Its
destiny
was
*NL*
linked
,
for
the
future
,
with
that
of
the
human
soul
,
of
which
it
was
one
*NL*
of
the
special
,
the
most
distinctive
ornaments
.
Perhaps
it
is
not-being
*NL*
that
is
the
true
state
,
and
all
our
dream
of
life
is
without
existence
;
*NL*
but
,
if
so
,
we
feel
that
it
must
be
that
these
phrases
of
music
,
these
*NL*
conceptions
which
exist
in
relation
to
our
dream
,
are
nothing
either
.
*NL*
We
shall
perish
,
but
we
have
for
our
hostages
these
divine
captives
who
*NL*
shall
follow
and
share
our
fate
.
And
death
in
their
company
is
something
*NL*
less
bitter
,
less
inglorious
,
perhaps
even
less
certain
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Swann
was
not
mistaken
in
believing
that
the
phrase
of
the
sonata
*NL*
did
,
really
,
exist
.
Human
as
it
was
from
this
point
of
view
,
it
*NL*
belonged
,
none
the
less
,
to
an
order
of
supernatural
creatures
whom
we
*NL*
have
never
seen
,
but
whom
,
in
spite
of
that
,
we
recognise
and
acclaim
*NL*
with
rapture
when
some
explorer
of
the
unseen
contrives
to
coax
one
*NL*
forth
,
to
bring
it
down
from
that
divine
world
to
which
he
has
access
*NL*
to
shine
for
a
brief
moment
in
the
firmament
of
ours
.
This
was
what
*NL*
Vinteuil
had
done
for
the
little
phrase
.
Swann
felt
that
the
composer
*NL*
had
been
content
-LRB-
with
the
musical
instruments
at
his
disposal
-RRB-
to
*NL*
draw
aside
its
veil
,
to
make
it
visible
,
following
and
respecting
its
*NL*
outlines
with
a
hand
so
loving
,
so
prudent
,
so
delicate
and
so
sure
,
*NL*
that
the
sound
altered
at
every
moment
,
blunting
itself
to
indicate
a
*NL*
shadow
,
springing
back
into
life
when
it
must
follow
the
curve
of
some
*NL*
more
bold
projection
.
And
one
proof
that
Swann
was
not
mistaken
when
he
*NL*
believed
in
the
real
existence
of
this
phrase
,
was
that
anyone
with
an
*NL*
ear
at
all
delicate
for
music
would
at
once
have
detected
the
imposture
*NL*
had
Vinteuil
,
endowed
with
less
power
to
see
and
to
render
its
forms
,
*NL*
sought
to
dissemble
-LRB-
by
adding
a
line
,
here
and
there
,
of
his
own
*NL*
invention
-RRB-
the
dimness
of
his
vision
or
the
feebleness
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
phrase
had
disappeared
.
Swann
knew
that
it
would
come
again
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
last
movement
,
after
a
long
passage
which
Mme.
Verdurin
's
*NL*
pianist
always
`
skipped
.
'
There
were
in
this
passage
some
admirable
*NL*
ideas
which
Swann
had
not
distinguished
on
first
hearing
the
sonata
,
and
*NL*
which
he
now
perceived
,
as
if
they
had
,
in
the
cloakroom
of
his
memory
,
*NL*
divested
themselves
of
their
uniform
disguise
of
novelty
.
Swann
listened
*NL*
to
all
the
scattered
themes
which
entered
into
the
composition
of
*NL*
the
phrase
,
as
its
premises
enter
into
the
inevitable
conclusion
of
a
*NL*
syllogism
;
he
was
assisting
at
the
mystery
of
its
birth
.
``
Audacity
,
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
to
himself
,
``
as
inspired
,
perhaps
,
as
a
Lavoisier
's
or
an
*NL*
Ampere
's
,
the
audacity
of
a
Vinteuil
making
experiment
,
discovering
*NL*
the
secret
laws
that
govern
an
unknown
force
,
driving
across
a
region
*NL*
unexplored
towards
the
one
possible
goal
the
invisible
team
in
which
he
*NL*
has
placed
his
trust
and
which
he
never
may
discern
!
''
How
charming
*NL*
the
dialogue
which
Swann
now
heard
between
piano
and
violin
,
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
last
passage
.
The
suppression
of
human
speech
,
so
far
*NL*
from
letting
fancy
reign
there
uncontrolled
-LRB-
as
one
might
have
thought
-RRB-
,
*NL*
had
eliminated
it
altogether
.
Never
was
spoken
language
of
such
*NL*
inflexible
necessity
,
never
had
it
known
questions
so
pertinent
,
such
*NL*
obvious
replies
.
At
first
the
piano
complained
alone
,
like
a
bird
*NL*
deserted
by
its
mate
;
the
violin
heard
and
answered
it
,
as
from
a
*NL*
neighbouring
tree
.
It
was
as
at
the
first
beginning
of
the
world
,
as
*NL*
if
there
were
not
yet
but
these
twain
upon
the
earth
,
or
rather
in
this
*NL*
world
closed
against
all
the
rest
,
so
fashioned
by
the
logic
of
its
*NL*
creator
that
in
it
there
should
never
be
any
but
themselves
;
the
world
*NL*
of
this
sonata
.
Was
it
a
bird
,
was
it
the
soul
,
not
yet
made
perfect
,
of
*NL*
the
little
phrase
,
was
it
a
fairy
,
invisibly
somewhere
lamenting
,
whose
*NL*
plaint
the
piano
heard
and
tenderly
repeated
?
Its
cries
were
so
sudden
*NL*
that
the
violinist
must
snatch
up
his
bow
and
race
to
catch
them
as
they
*NL*
came
.
Marvellous
bird
!
The
violinist
seemed
to
wish
to
charm
,
to
tame
,
*NL*
to
woo
,
to
win
it
.
Already
it
had
passed
into
his
soul
,
already
the
*NL*
little
phrase
which
it
evoked
shook
like
a
medium
's
the
body
of
the
*NL*
violinist
,
`
possessed
'
indeed
.
Swann
knew
that
the
phrase
was
going
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
once
again
.
And
his
personality
was
now
so
divided
that
*NL*
the
strain
of
waiting
for
the
imminent
moment
when
he
would
find
himself
*NL*
face
to
face
,
once
more
,
with
the
phrase
,
convulsed
him
in
one
of
those
*NL*
sobs
which
a
fine
line
of
poetry
or
a
piece
of
alarming
news
will
wring
*NL*
from
us
,
not
when
we
are
alone
,
but
when
we
repeat
one
or
the
other
to
*NL*
a
friend
,
in
whom
we
see
ourselves
reflected
,
like
a
third
person
,
whose
*NL*
probable
emotion
softens
him
.
It
reappeared
,
but
this
time
to
remain
*NL*
poised
in
the
air
,
and
to
sport
there
for
a
moment
only
,
as
though
*NL*
immobile
,
and
shortly
to
expire
.
And
so
Swann
lost
nothing
of
the
*NL*
precious
time
for
which
it
lingered
.
It
was
still
there
,
like
an
*NL*
iridescent
bubble
that
floats
for
a
while
unbroken
.
As
a
rainbow
,
when
*NL*
its
brightness
fades
,
seems
to
subside
,
then
soars
again
and
,
before
it
*NL*
is
extinguished
,
is
glorified
with
greater
splendour
than
it
has
ever
*NL*
shewn
;
so
to
the
two
colours
which
the
phrase
had
hitherto
allowed
to
*NL*
appear
it
added
others
now
,
chords
shot
with
every
hue
in
the
prism
,
and
*NL*
made
them
sing
.
Swann
dared
not
move
,
and
would
have
liked
to
compel
all
*NL*
the
other
people
in
the
room
to
remain
still
also
,
as
if
the
slightest
*NL*
movement
might
embarrass
the
magic
presence
,
supernatural
,
delicious
,
*NL*
frail
,
that
would
so
easily
vanish
.
But
no
one
,
as
it
happened
,
dreamed
*NL*
of
speaking
.
The
ineffable
utterance
of
one
solitary
man
,
absent
,
*NL*
perhaps
dead
-LRB-
Swann
did
not
know
whether
Vinteuil
were
still
alive
-RRB-
,
*NL*
breathed
out
above
the
rites
of
those
two
hierophants
,
sufficed
to
*NL*
arrest
the
attention
of
three
hundred
minds
,
and
made
of
that
stage
on
*NL*
which
a
soul
was
thus
called
into
being
one
of
the
noblest
altars
on
*NL*
which
a
supernatural
ceremony
could
be
performed
.
It
followed
that
,
when
*NL*
the
phrase
at
last
was
finished
,
and
only
its
fragmentary
echoes
floated
*NL*
among
the
subsequent
themes
which
had
already
taken
its
place
,
if
Swann
*NL*
at
first
was
annoyed
to
see
the
Comtesse
de
Monteriender
,
famed
for
her
*NL*
imbecilities
,
lean
over
towards
him
to
confide
in
him
her
impressions
,
*NL*
before
even
the
sonata
had
come
to
an
end
;
he
could
not
refrain
from
*NL*
smiling
,
and
perhaps
also
found
an
underlying
sense
,
which
she
was
*NL*
incapable
of
perceiving
,
in
the
words
that
she
used
.
Dazzled
by
the
*NL*
virtuosity
of
the
performers
,
the
Comtesse
exclaimed
to
Swann
:
``
It
's
*NL*
astonishing
!
I
have
never
seen
anything
to
beat
it
...
''
But
a
scrupulous
*NL*
regard
for
accuracy
making
her
correct
her
first
assertion
,
she
added
*NL*
the
reservation
:
``
anything
to
beat
it
...
since
the
table-turning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
evening
,
Swann
understood
that
the
feeling
which
Odette
had
*NL*
once
had
for
him
would
never
revive
,
that
his
hopes
of
happiness
would
*NL*
not
be
realised
now
.
And
the
days
on
which
,
by
a
lucky
chance
,
she
had
*NL*
once
more
shewn
herself
kind
and
loving
to
him
,
or
if
she
had
paid
him
*NL*
any
attention
,
he
recorded
those
apparent
and
misleading
signs
of
*NL*
a
slight
movement
on
her
part
towards
him
with
the
same
tender
and
*NL*
sceptical
solicitude
,
the
desperate
joy
that
people
reveal
who
,
when
*NL*
they
are
nursing
a
friend
in
the
last
days
of
an
incurable
malady
,
*NL*
relate
,
as
significant
facts
of
infinite
value
:
``
Yesterday
he
went
*NL*
through
his
accounts
himself
,
and
actually
corrected
a
mistake
that
we
*NL*
had
made
in
adding
them
up
;
he
ate
an
egg
to-day
and
seemed
quite
to
*NL*
enjoy
it
,
if
he
digests
it
properly
we
shall
try
him
with
a
cutlet
*NL*
to-morrow
,
''
--
although
they
themselves
know
that
these
things
are
*NL*
meaningless
on
the
eve
of
an
inevitable
death
.
No
doubt
Swann
was
*NL*
assured
that
if
he
had
now
been
living
at
a
distance
from
Odette
he
*NL*
would
gradually
have
lost
all
interest
in
her
,
so
that
he
would
have
*NL*
been
glad
to
learn
that
she
was
leaving
Paris
for
ever
;
he
would
have
*NL*
had
the
courage
to
remain
there
;
but
he
had
not
the
courage
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
often
thought
of
going
.
Now
that
he
was
once
again
at
work
upon
*NL*
his
essay
on
Vermeer
,
he
wanted
to
return
,
for
a
few
days
at
least
,
to
*NL*
The
Hague
,
to
Dresden
,
to
Brunswick
.
He
was
certain
that
a
`
Toilet
of
*NL*
Diana
'
which
had
been
acquired
by
the
Mauritshuis
at
the
Goldschmidt
*NL*
sale
as
a
Nicholas
Maes
was
in
reality
a
Vermeer
.
And
he
would
have
*NL*
liked
to
be
able
to
examine
the
picture
on
the
spot
,
so
as
to
strengthen
*NL*
his
conviction
.
But
to
leave
Paris
while
Odette
was
there
,
and
even
when
*NL*
she
was
not
there
--
for
in
strange
places
where
our
sensations
have
not
*NL*
been
numbed
by
habit
,
we
refresh
,
we
revive
an
old
pain
--
was
for
him
so
*NL*
cruel
a
project
that
he
felt
himself
to
be
capable
of
entertaining
it
*NL*
incessantly
in
his
mind
only
because
he
knew
himself
to
be
resolute
in
*NL*
his
determination
never
to
put
it
into
effect
.
But
it
would
happen
*NL*
that
,
while
he
was
asleep
,
the
intention
to
travel
would
reawaken
in
him
*NL*
-LRB-
without
his
remembering
that
this
particular
tour
was
impossible
-RRB-
and
*NL*
would
be
realised
.
One
night
he
dreamed
that
he
was
going
away
for
a
*NL*
year
;
leaning
from
the
window
of
the
train
towards
a
young
man
on
the
*NL*
platform
who
wept
as
he
bade
him
farewell
,
he
was
seeking
to
persuade
*NL*
this
young
man
to
come
away
also
.
The
train
began
to
move
;
he
awoke
*NL*
in
alarm
,
and
remembered
that
he
was
not
going
away
,
that
he
would
see
*NL*
Odette
that
evening
,
and
next
day
and
almost
every
day
.
And
then
,
being
*NL*
still
deeply
moved
by
his
dream
,
he
would
thank
heaven
for
those
special
*NL*
circumstances
which
made
him
independent
,
thanks
to
which
he
could
*NL*
remain
in
Odette
's
vicinity
,
and
could
even
succeed
in
making
her
allow
*NL*
him
to
see
her
sometimes
;
and
,
counting
over
the
list
of
his
advantages
:
*NL*
his
social
position
--
his
fortune
,
from
which
she
stood
too
often
in
*NL*
need
of
assistance
not
to
shrink
from
the
prospect
of
a
definite
rupture
*NL*
-LRB-
having
even
,
so
people
said
,
an
ulterior
plan
of
getting
him
to
marry
*NL*
her
-RRB-
--
his
friendship
with
M.
de
Charlus
,
which
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
*NL*
had
never
won
him
any
very
great
favour
from
Odette
,
but
which
gave
him
*NL*
the
pleasant
feeling
that
she
was
always
hearing
complimentary
things
*NL*
said
about
him
by
this
common
friend
for
whom
she
had
so
great
an
*NL*
esteem
--
and
even
his
own
intelligence
,
the
whole
of
which
he
employed
in
*NL*
weaving
,
every
day
,
a
fresh
plot
which
would
make
his
presence
,
if
not
*NL*
agreeable
,
at
any
rate
necessary
to
Odette
--
he
thought
of
what
might
*NL*
have
happened
to
him
if
all
these
advantages
had
been
lacking
,
he
*NL*
thought
that
,
if
he
had
been
,
like
so
many
other
men
,
poor
and
humble
,
*NL*
without
resources
,
forced
to
undertake
any
task
that
might
be
offered
to
*NL*
him
,
or
tied
down
by
parents
or
by
a
wife
,
he
might
have
been
obliged
*NL*
to
part
from
Odette
,
that
that
dream
,
the
terror
of
which
was
still
so
*NL*
recent
,
might
well
have
been
true
;
and
he
said
to
himself
:
``
People
do
n't
*NL*
know
when
they
are
happy
.
They
're
never
so
unhappy
as
they
think
they
*NL*
are
.
''
But
he
reflected
that
this
existence
had
lasted
already
for
*NL*
several
years
,
that
all
that
he
could
now
hope
for
was
that
it
should
*NL*
last
for
ever
,
that
he
would
sacrifice
his
work
,
his
pleasures
,
his
*NL*
friends
,
in
fact
the
whole
of
his
life
to
the
daily
expectation
of
a
*NL*
meeting
which
,
when
it
occurred
,
would
bring
him
no
happiness
;
and
he
*NL*
asked
himself
whether
he
was
not
mistaken
,
whether
the
circumstances
*NL*
that
had
favoured
their
relations
and
had
prevented
a
final
rupture
had
*NL*
not
done
a
disservice
to
his
career
,
whether
the
outcome
to
be
*NL*
desired
was
not
that
as
to
which
he
rejoiced
that
it
happened
only
in
*NL*
dreams
--
his
own
departure
;
and
he
said
to
himself
that
people
did
not
*NL*
know
when
they
were
unhappy
,
that
they
were
never
so
happy
as
they
*NL*
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
hoped
that
she
would
die
,
painlessly
,
in
some
accident
,
she
*NL*
who
was
out
of
doors
in
the
streets
,
crossing
busy
thoroughfares
,
*NL*
from
morning
to
night
.
And
as
she
always
returned
safe
and
sound
,
he
*NL*
marvelled
at
the
strength
,
at
the
suppleness
of
the
human
body
,
which
*NL*
was
able
continually
to
hold
in
check
,
to
outwit
all
the
perils
that
*NL*
environed
it
-LRB-
which
to
Swann
seemed
innumerable
,
since
his
own
secret
*NL*
desire
had
strewn
them
in
her
path
-RRB-
,
and
so
allowed
its
occupant
,
the
*NL*
soul
,
to
abandon
itself
,
day
after
day
,
and
almost
with
impunity
,
to
its
*NL*
career
of
mendacity
,
to
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
.
And
Swann
felt
a
very
*NL*
cordial
sympathy
with
that
Mahomet
II
whose
portrait
by
Bellini
he
*NL*
admired
,
who
,
on
finding
that
he
had
fallen
madly
in
love
with
one
of
*NL*
his
wives
,
stabbed
her
,
in
order
,
as
his
Venetian
biographer
artlessly
*NL*
relates
,
to
recover
his
spiritual
freedom
.
Then
he
would
be
ashamed
*NL*
of
thinking
thus
only
of
himself
,
and
his
own
sufferings
would
seem
to
*NL*
deserve
no
pity
now
that
he
himself
was
disposing
so
cheaply
of
Odette
's
*NL*
very
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
he
was
unable
to
separate
himself
from
her
without
a
subsequent
*NL*
return
,
if
at
least
he
had
seen
her
continuously
and
without
separations
*NL*
his
grief
would
ultimately
have
been
assuaged
,
and
his
love
would
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
have
died
.
And
from
the
moment
when
she
did
not
wish
to
leave
*NL*
Paris
for
ever
he
had
hoped
that
she
would
never
go
.
As
he
knew
that
her
*NL*
one
prolonged
absence
,
every
year
,
was
in
August
and
September
,
he
had
*NL*
abundant
opportunity
,
several
months
in
advance
,
to
dissociate
from
it
*NL*
the
grim
picture
of
her
absence
throughout
Eternity
which
was
lodged
in
*NL*
him
by
anticipation
,
and
which
,
consisting
of
days
closely
akin
to
the
*NL*
days
through
which
he
was
then
passing
,
floated
in
a
cold
transparency
*NL*
in
his
mind
,
which
it
saddened
and
depressed
,
though
without
causing
him
*NL*
any
intolerable
pain
.
But
that
conception
of
the
future
,
that
flowing
*NL*
stream
,
colourless
and
unconfined
,
a
single
word
from
Odette
sufficed
*NL*
to
penetrate
through
all
Swann
's
defences
,
and
like
a
block
of
ice
*NL*
immobilised
it
,
congealed
its
fluidity
,
made
it
freeze
altogether
;
and
*NL*
Swann
felt
himself
suddenly
filled
with
an
enormous
and
unbreakable
mass
*NL*
which
pressed
on
the
inner
walls
of
his
consciousness
until
he
was
fain
*NL*
to
burst
asunder
;
for
Odette
had
said
casually
,
watching
him
with
a
*NL*
malicious
smile
:
``
Forcheville
is
going
for
a
fine
trip
at
Whitsuntide
.
*NL*
He
's
going
to
Egypt
!
''
and
Swann
had
at
once
understood
that
this
meant
:
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
Egypt
at
Whitsuntide
with
Forcheville
.
''
And
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
if
,
a
few
days
later
,
Swann
began
:
``
About
that
trip
that
you
told
me
you
*NL*
were
going
to
take
with
Forcheville
,
''
she
would
answer
carelessly
:
``
Yes
,
*NL*
my
dear
boy
,
we
're
starting
on
the
19th
;
we
'll
send
you
a
`
view
'
of
the
*NL*
Pyramids
.
''
Then
he
was
determined
to
know
whether
she
was
Forcheville
's
*NL*
mistress
,
to
ask
her
point-blank
,
to
insist
upon
her
telling
him
.
He
*NL*
knew
that
there
were
some
perjuries
which
,
being
so
superstitious
,
she
*NL*
would
not
commit
,
and
besides
,
the
fear
,
which
had
hitherto
restrained
*NL*
his
curiosity
,
of
making
Odette
angry
if
he
questioned
her
,
of
making
*NL*
himself
odious
,
had
ceased
to
exist
now
that
he
had
lost
all
hope
of
*NL*
ever
being
loved
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
received
an
anonymous
letter
which
told
him
that
Odette
had
*NL*
been
the
mistress
of
countless
men
-LRB-
several
of
whom
it
named
,
among
*NL*
them
Forcheville
,
M.
de
Br√©aut√©
and
the
painter
-RRB-
and
women
,
and
that
she
*NL*
frequented
houses
of
ill-fame
.
He
was
tormented
by
the
discovery
that
*NL*
there
was
to
be
numbered
among
his
friends
a
creature
capable
of
*NL*
sending
him
such
a
letter
-LRB-
for
certain
details
betrayed
in
the
writer
a
*NL*
familiarity
with
his
private
life
-RRB-
.
He
wondered
who
it
could
be
.
But
he
*NL*
had
never
had
any
suspicion
with
regard
to
the
unknown
actions
of
other
*NL*
people
,
those
which
had
no
visible
connection
with
what
they
said
.
*NL*
And
when
he
wanted
to
know
whether
it
was
rather
beneath
the
apparent
*NL*
character
of
M.
de
Charlus
,
or
of
M.
des
Laumes
,
or
of
M.
d'Orsan
that
*NL*
he
must
place
the
untravelled
region
in
which
this
ignoble
action
might
*NL*
have
had
its
birth
;
as
none
of
these
men
had
ever
,
in
conversation
*NL*
with
Swann
,
suggested
that
he
approved
of
anonymous
letters
,
and
as
*NL*
everything
that
they
had
ever
said
to
him
implied
that
they
strongly
*NL*
disapproved
,
he
saw
no
further
reason
for
associating
this
infamy
with
*NL*
the
character
of
any
one
of
them
more
than
with
the
rest
.
M.
de
Charlus
*NL*
was
somewhat
inclined
to
eccentricity
,
but
he
was
fundamentally
good
and
*NL*
kind
;
M.
des
Laumes
was
a
trifle
dry
,
but
wholesome
and
straight
.
As
for
*NL*
M.
d'Orsan
,
Swann
had
never
met
anyone
who
,
even
in
the
most
depressing
*NL*
circumstances
,
would
come
to
him
with
a
more
heartfelt
utterance
,
would
*NL*
act
more
properly
or
with
more
discretion
.
So
much
so
that
he
was
unable
*NL*
to
understand
the
rather
indelicate
part
commonly
attributed
to
M.
*NL*
d'Orsan
in
his
relations
with
a
certain
wealthy
woman
,
and
that
whenever
*NL*
he
thought
of
him
he
was
obliged
to
set
that
evil
reputation
on
one
*NL*
side
,
as
irreconcilable
with
so
many
unmistakable
proofs
of
his
genuine
*NL*
sincerity
and
refinement
.
For
a
moment
Swann
felt
that
his
mind
was
*NL*
becoming
clouded
,
and
he
thought
of
something
else
so
as
to
recover
*NL*
a
little
light
;
until
he
had
the
courage
to
return
to
those
other
*NL*
reflections
.
But
then
,
after
not
having
been
able
to
suspect
anyone
,
he
*NL*
was
forced
to
suspect
everyone
that
he
knew
.
After
all
,
M.
de
Charlus
*NL*
might
be
most
fond
of
him
,
might
be
most
good-natured
;
but
he
was
a
*NL*
neuropath
;
to-morrow
,
perhaps
,
he
would
burst
into
tears
on
hearing
that
*NL*
Swann
was
ill
;
and
to-day
,
from
jealousy
,
or
in
anger
,
or
carried
away
*NL*
by
some
sudden
idea
,
he
might
have
wished
to
do
him
a
deliberate
injury
.
*NL*
Really
,
that
kind
of
man
was
the
worst
of
all
.
The
Prince
des
Laumes
*NL*
was
,
certainly
,
far
less
devoted
to
Swann
than
was
M.
de
Charlus
.
But
*NL*
for
that
very
reason
he
had
not
the
same
susceptibility
with
regard
to
*NL*
him
;
and
besides
,
his
was
a
nature
which
,
though
,
no
doubt
,
it
was
cold
,
*NL*
was
as
incapable
of
a
base
as
of
a
magnanimous
action
.
Swann
regretted
*NL*
that
he
had
formed
no
attachments
in
his
life
except
to
such
people
.
*NL*
Then
he
reflected
that
what
prevents
men
from
doing
harm
to
their
*NL*
neighbours
is
fellow-feeling
,
that
he
could
not
,
in
the
last
resort
,
*NL*
answer
for
any
but
men
whose
natures
were
analogous
to
his
own
,
as
was
,
*NL*
so
far
as
the
heart
went
,
that
of
M.
de
Charlus
.
The
mere
thought
of
*NL*
causing
Swann
so
much
distress
would
have
been
revolting
to
him
.
But
*NL*
with
a
man
who
was
insensible
,
of
another
order
of
humanity
,
as
was
the
*NL*
Prince
des
Laumes
,
how
was
one
to
foresee
the
actions
to
which
he
might
*NL*
be
led
by
the
promptings
of
a
different
nature
?
To
have
a
good
heart
was
*NL*
everything
,
and
M.
de
Charlus
had
one
.
But
M.
d'Orsan
was
not
lacking
*NL*
in
that
either
,
and
his
relations
with
Swann
--
cordial
,
but
scarcely
*NL*
intimate
,
arising
from
the
pleasure
which
,
as
they
held
the
same
views
*NL*
about
everything
,
they
found
in
talking
together
--
were
more
quiescent
*NL*
than
the
enthusiastic
affection
of
M.
de
Charlus
,
who
was
apt
to
be
*NL*
led
into
passionate
activity
,
good
or
evil
.
If
there
was
anyone
by
*NL*
whom
Swann
felt
that
he
had
always
been
understood
,
and
-LRB-
with
delicacy
-RRB-
*NL*
loved
,
it
was
M.
d'Orsan
.
Yes
,
but
the
life
he
led
;
it
could
hardly
be
*NL*
called
honourable
.
Swann
regretted
that
he
had
never
taken
any
notice
*NL*
of
those
rumours
,
that
he
himself
had
admitted
,
jestingly
,
that
he
had
*NL*
never
felt
so
keen
a
sense
of
sympathy
,
or
of
respect
,
as
when
he
was
*NL*
in
thoroughly
`
detrimental
'
society
.
``
It
is
not
for
nothing
,
''
he
now
*NL*
assured
himself
,
``
that
when
people
pass
judgment
upon
their
neighbour
,
*NL*
their
finding
is
based
upon
his
actions
.
It
is
those
alone
that
are
*NL*
significant
,
and
not
at
all
what
we
say
or
what
we
think
.
Charlus
and
*NL*
des
Laumes
may
have
this
or
that
fault
,
but
they
are
men
of
honour
.
*NL*
Orsan
,
perhaps
,
has
not
the
same
faults
,
but
he
is
not
a
man
of
honour
.
*NL*
He
may
have
acted
dishonourably
once
again
.
''
Then
he
suspected
R√©mi
,
*NL*
who
,
it
was
true
,
could
only
have
inspired
the
letter
,
but
he
now
felt
*NL*
himself
,
for
a
moment
,
to
be
on
the
right
track
.
To
begin
with
,
Loredan
*NL*
had
his
own
reasons
for
wishing
harm
to
Odette
.
And
then
,
how
were
we
*NL*
not
to
suppose
that
our
servants
,
living
in
a
situation
inferior
to
our
*NL*
own
,
adding
to
our
fortunes
and
to
our
frailties
imaginary
riches
and
*NL*
vices
for
which
they
at
once
envied
and
despised
us
,
should
not
find
*NL*
themselves
led
by
fate
to
act
in
a
manner
abhorrent
to
people
of
our
own
*NL*
class
?
He
also
suspected
my
grandfather
.
On
every
occasion
when
Swann
*NL*
had
asked
him
to
do
him
any
service
,
had
he
not
invariably
declined
?
*NL*
Besides
,
with
his
ideas
of
middle-class
respectability
,
he
might
have
*NL*
thought
that
he
was
acting
for
Swann
's
good
.
He
suspected
,
in
turn
,
*NL*
Bergotte
,
the
painter
,
the
Verdurins
;
paused
for
a
moment
to
admire
*NL*
once
again
the
wisdom
of
people
in
society
,
who
refused
to
mix
in
the
*NL*
artistic
circles
in
which
such
things
were
possible
,
were
,
perhaps
,
even
*NL*
openly
avowed
,
as
excellent
jokes
;
but
then
he
recalled
the
marks
of
*NL*
honesty
that
were
to
be
observed
in
those
Bohemians
,
and
contrasted
them
*NL*
with
the
life
of
expedients
,
often
bordering
on
fraudulence
,
to
which
*NL*
the
want
of
money
,
the
craving
for
luxury
,
the
corrupting
influence
of
*NL*
their
pleasures
often
drove
members
of
the
aristocracy
.
In
a
word
,
this
*NL*
anonymous
letter
proved
that
he
himself
knew
a
human
being
capable
of
*NL*
the
most
infamous
conduct
,
but
he
could
see
no
reason
why
that
infamy
*NL*
should
lurk
in
the
depths
--
which
no
strange
eye
might
explore
--
of
*NL*
the
warm
heart
rather
than
the
cold
,
the
artist
's
rather
than
the
*NL*
business-man
's
,
the
noble
's
rather
than
the
flunkey
's
.
What
criterion
*NL*
ought
one
to
adopt
,
in
order
to
judge
one
's
fellows
?
After
all
,
there
*NL*
was
not
a
single
one
of
the
people
whom
he
knew
who
might
not
,
in
*NL*
certain
circumstances
,
prove
capable
of
a
shameful
action
.
Must
he
then
*NL*
cease
to
see
them
all
?
His
mind
grew
clouded
;
he
passed
his
hands
two
*NL*
or
three
times
across
his
brow
,
wiped
his
glasses
with
his
handkerchief
,
*NL*
and
remembering
that
,
after
all
,
men
who
were
as
good
as
himself
*NL*
frequented
the
society
of
M.
de
Charlus
,
the
Prince
des
Laumes
and
*NL*
the
rest
,
he
persuaded
himself
that
this
meant
,
if
not
that
they
were
*NL*
incapable
of
shameful
actions
,
at
least
that
it
was
a
necessity
in
human
*NL*
life
,
to
which
everyone
must
submit
,
to
frequent
the
society
of
people
*NL*
who
were
,
perhaps
,
not
incapable
of
such
actions
.
And
he
continued
to
*NL*
shake
hands
with
all
the
friends
whom
he
had
suspected
,
with
the
purely
*NL*
formal
reservation
that
each
one
of
them
had
,
possibly
,
been
seeking
to
*NL*
drive
him
to
despair
.
As
for
the
actual
contents
of
the
letter
,
they
*NL*
did
not
disturb
him
;
for
in
not
one
of
the
charges
which
it
formulated
*NL*
against
Odette
could
he
see
the
least
vestige
of
fact
.
Like
many
other
*NL*
men
,
Swann
had
a
naturally
lazy
mind
,
and
was
slow
in
invention
.
He
knew
*NL*
quite
well
as
a
general
truth
,
that
human
life
is
full
of
contrasts
,
but
*NL*
in
the
case
of
any
one
human
being
he
imagined
all
that
part
of
his
or
*NL*
her
life
with
which
he
was
not
familiar
as
being
identical
with
the
*NL*
part
with
which
he
was
.
He
imagined
what
was
kept
secret
from
him
in
the
*NL*
light
of
what
was
revealed
.
At
such
times
as
he
spent
with
Odette
,
*NL*
if
their
conversation
turned
upon
an
indelicate
act
committed
,
or
*NL*
an
indelicate
sentiment
expressed
by
some
third
person
,
she
would
*NL*
ruthlessly
condemn
the
culprit
by
virtue
of
the
same
moral
principles
*NL*
which
Swann
had
always
heard
expressed
by
his
own
parents
,
and
to
which
*NL*
he
himself
had
remained
loyal
;
and
then
,
she
would
arrange
her
flowers
,
*NL*
would
sip
her
tea
,
would
shew
an
interest
in
his
work
.
So
Swann
extended
*NL*
those
habits
to
fill
the
rest
of
her
life
,
he
reconstructed
those
*NL*
actions
when
he
wished
to
form
a
picture
of
the
moments
in
which
he
and
*NL*
she
were
apart
.
If
anyone
had
portrayed
her
to
him
as
she
was
,
or
rather
*NL*
as
she
had
been
for
so
long
with
himself
,
but
had
substituted
some
*NL*
other
man
,
he
would
have
been
distressed
,
for
such
a
portrait
would
have
*NL*
struck
him
as
lifelike
.
But
to
suppose
that
she
went
to
bad
houses
,
*NL*
that
she
abandoned
herself
to
orgies
with
other
women
,
that
she
led
*NL*
the
crapulous
existence
of
the
most
abject
,
the
most
contemptible
of
*NL*
mortals
--
would
be
an
insane
wandering
of
the
mind
,
for
the
realisation
*NL*
of
which
,
thank
heaven
,
the
chrysanthemums
that
he
could
imagine
,
the
*NL*
daily
cups
of
tea
,
the
virtuous
indignation
left
neither
time
nor
*NL*
place
.
Only
,
now
and
again
,
he
gave
Odette
to
understand
that
people
*NL*
maliciously
kept
him
informed
of
everything
that
she
did
;
and
making
*NL*
opportune
use
of
some
detail
--
insignificant
but
true
--
which
he
had
*NL*
accidentally
learned
,
as
though
it
were
the
sole
fragment
which
he
would
*NL*
allow
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
to
pass
his
lips
,
out
of
the
numberless
*NL*
other
fragments
of
that
complete
reconstruction
of
her
daily
life
which
*NL*
he
carried
secretly
in
his
mind
,
he
led
her
to
suppose
that
he
was
*NL*
perfectly
informed
upon
matters
,
which
,
in
reality
,
he
neither
knew
nor
*NL*
suspected
,
for
if
he
often
adjured
Odette
never
to
swerve
from
or
make
*NL*
alteration
of
the
truth
,
that
was
only
,
whether
he
realised
it
or
no
,
in
*NL*
order
that
Odette
should
tell
him
everything
that
she
did
.
No
doubt
,
as
*NL*
he
used
to
assure
Odette
,
he
loved
sincerity
,
but
only
as
he
might
*NL*
love
a
pander
who
could
keep
him
in
touch
with
the
daily
life
of
his
*NL*
mistress
.
Moreover
,
his
love
of
sincerity
,
not
being
disinterested
,
had
*NL*
not
improved
his
character
.
The
truth
which
he
cherished
was
that
which
*NL*
Odette
would
tell
him
;
but
he
himself
,
in
order
to
extract
that
truth
*NL*
from
her
,
was
not
afraid
to
have
recourse
to
falsehood
,
that
very
*NL*
falsehood
which
he
never
ceased
to
depict
to
Odette
as
leading
every
*NL*
human
creature
down
to
utter
degradation
.
In
a
word
,
he
lied
as
much
*NL*
as
did
Odette
,
because
,
while
more
unhappy
than
she
,
he
was
no
less
*NL*
egotistical
.
And
she
,
when
she
heard
him
repeating
thus
to
her
the
*NL*
things
that
she
had
done
,
would
stare
at
him
with
a
look
of
distrust
*NL*
and
,
at
all
hazards
,
of
indignation
,
so
as
not
to
appear
to
be
*NL*
humiliated
,
and
to
be
blushing
for
her
actions
.
One
day
,
after
the
*NL*
longest
period
of
calm
through
which
he
had
yet
been
able
to
exist
*NL*
without
being
overtaken
by
an
attack
of
jealousy
,
he
had
accepted
an
*NL*
invitation
to
spend
the
evening
at
the
theatre
with
the
Princesse
des
*NL*
Laumes
.
Having
opened
his
newspaper
to
find
out
what
was
being
*NL*
played
,
the
sight
of
the
title
--
_
Les
Filles
de
Marbre
_
,
by
Th√©odore
*NL*
Barri√®re
,
--
struck
him
so
cruel
a
blow
that
he
recoiled
instinctively
*NL*
from
it
and
turned
his
head
away
.
Illuminated
,
as
though
by
a
row
of
*NL*
footlights
,
in
the
new
surroundings
in
which
it
now
appeared
,
that
word
*NL*
`
marble
,
'
which
he
had
lost
the
power
to
distinguish
,
so
often
had
it
*NL*
passed
,
in
print
,
beneath
his
eyes
,
had
suddenly
become
visible
once
*NL*
again
,
and
had
at
once
brought
back
to
his
mind
the
story
which
Odette
*NL*
had
told
him
,
long
ago
,
of
a
visit
which
she
had
paid
to
the
Salon
at
*NL*
the
Palais
d'Industrie
with
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
had
said
to
her
,
``
Take
*NL*
care
,
now
!
I
know
how
to
melt
you
,
all
right
.
You
're
not
made
of
*NL*
marble
.
''
Odette
had
assured
him
that
it
was
only
a
joke
,
and
he
had
*NL*
not
attached
any
importance
to
it
at
the
time
.
But
he
had
had
more
*NL*
confidence
in
her
then
than
he
had
now
.
And
the
anonymous
letter
*NL*
referred
explicitly
to
relations
of
that
sort
.
Without
daring
to
lift
*NL*
his
eyes
to
the
newspaper
,
he
opened
it
,
turned
the
page
so
as
not
to
*NL*
see
again
the
words
,
_
Filles
de
Marbre
_
,
and
began
to
read
mechanically
*NL*
the
news
from
the
provinces
.
There
had
been
a
storm
in
the
Channel
,
*NL*
and
damage
was
reported
from
Dieppe
,
Cabourg
,
Beuzeval
...
Suddenly
he
*NL*
recoiled
again
in
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
Beuzeval
had
suggested
to
him
that
of
another
place
in
the
*NL*
same
district
,
Beuzeville
,
which
carried
also
,
bound
to
it
by
a
hyphen
,
*NL*
a
second
name
,
to
wit
Br√©aut√©
,
which
he
had
often
seen
on
maps
,
but
*NL*
without
ever
previously
remarking
that
it
was
the
same
name
as
that
*NL*
borne
by
his
friend
M.
de
Br√©aut√©
,
whom
the
anonymous
letter
accused
of
*NL*
having
been
Odette
's
lover
.
After
all
,
when
it
came
to
M.
de
Br√©aut√©
,
*NL*
there
was
nothing
improbable
in
the
charge
;
but
so
far
as
Mme.
Verdurin
*NL*
was
concerned
,
it
was
a
sheer
impossibility
.
From
the
fact
that
Odette
*NL*
did
occasionally
tell
a
lie
,
it
was
not
fair
to
conclude
that
she
never
,
*NL*
by
any
chance
,
told
the
truth
,
and
in
these
bantering
conversations
*NL*
with
Mme.
Verdurin
which
she
herself
had
repeated
to
Swann
,
he
could
*NL*
recognize
those
meaningless
and
dangerous
pleasantries
which
,
in
their
*NL*
inexperience
of
life
and
ignorance
of
vice
,
women
often
utter
-LRB-
thereby
*NL*
certifying
their
own
innocence
-RRB-
,
who
--
as
,
for
instance
,
Odette
,
--
would
*NL*
be
the
last
people
in
the
world
to
feel
any
undue
affection
for
one
*NL*
another
.
Whereas
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
indignation
with
which
she
*NL*
had
scattered
the
suspicions
which
she
had
unintentionally
brought
into
*NL*
being
,
for
a
moment
,
in
his
mind
by
her
story
,
fitted
in
with
everything
*NL*
that
he
knew
of
the
tastes
,
the
temperament
of
his
mistress
.
But
at
*NL*
that
moment
,
by
an
inspiration
of
jealousy
,
analogous
to
the
inspiration
*NL*
which
reveals
to
a
poet
or
a
philosopher
,
who
has
nothing
,
so
far
,
but
*NL*
an
odd
pair
of
rhymes
or
a
detached
observation
,
the
idea
or
the
natural
*NL*
law
which
will
give
power
,
mastery
to
his
work
,
Swann
recalled
for
the
*NL*
first
time
a
remark
which
Odette
had
made
to
him
,
at
least
two
years
*NL*
before
:
``
Oh
,
Mme.
Verdurin
,
she
wo
n't
hear
of
anything
just
now
but
me
.
*NL*
I
'm
a
`
love
,
'
if
you
please
,
and
she
kisses
me
,
and
wants
me
to
go
with
*NL*
her
everywhere
,
and
call
her
by
her
Christian
name
.
''
So
far
from
seeing
*NL*
in
these
expressions
any
connection
with
the
absurd
insinuations
,
*NL*
intended
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
vice
,
which
Odette
had
since
*NL*
repeated
to
him
,
he
had
welcomed
them
as
a
proof
of
Mme.
Verdurin
's
*NL*
warm-hearted
and
generous
friendship
.
But
now
this
old
memory
of
her
*NL*
affection
for
Odette
had
coalesced
suddenly
with
his
more
recent
memory
*NL*
of
her
unseemly
conversation
.
He
could
no
longer
separate
them
in
his
*NL*
mind
,
and
he
saw
them
blended
in
reality
,
the
affection
imparting
a
*NL*
certain
seriousness
and
importance
to
the
pleasantries
which
,
in
return
,
*NL*
spoiled
the
affection
of
its
innocence
.
He
went
to
see
Odette
.
He
sat
*NL*
down
,
keeping
at
a
distance
from
her
.
He
did
not
dare
to
embrace
her
,
*NL*
not
knowing
whether
in
her
,
in
himself
,
it
would
be
affection
or
anger
*NL*
that
a
kiss
would
provoke
.
He
sat
there
silent
,
watching
their
love
*NL*
expire
.
Suddenly
he
made
up
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Odette
,
my
darling
,
''
he
began
,
``
I
know
,
I
am
being
simply
odious
,
but
I
*NL*
must
ask
you
a
few
questions
.
You
remember
what
I
once
thought
about
you
*NL*
and
Mme.
Verdurin
?
Tell
me
,
was
it
true
?
Have
you
,
with
her
or
anyone
*NL*
else
,
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
,
pursing
her
lips
together
;
a
sign
which
people
*NL*
commonly
employ
to
signify
that
they
are
not
going
,
because
it
would
*NL*
bore
them
to
go
,
when
some
one
has
asked
,
``
Are
you
coming
to
watch
the
*NL*
procession
go
by
?
''
,
or
``
Will
you
be
at
the
review
?
''
.
But
this
shake
of
*NL*
the
head
,
which
is
thus
commonly
used
to
decline
participation
in
*NL*
an
event
that
has
yet
to
come
,
imparts
for
that
reason
an
element
of
*NL*
uncertainty
to
the
denial
of
participation
in
an
event
that
is
past
.
*NL*
Furthermore
,
it
suggests
reasons
of
personal
convenience
,
rather
than
*NL*
any
definite
repudiation
,
any
moral
impossibility
.
When
he
saw
Odette
*NL*
thus
make
him
a
sign
that
the
insinuation
was
false
,
he
realised
that
it
*NL*
was
quite
possibly
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
you
,
I
never
did
;
you
know
quite
well
,
''
she
added
,
seeming
*NL*
angry
and
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
all
that
;
but
are
you
quite
sure
?
Do
n't
say
to
me
,
`
You
*NL*
know
quite
well
'
;
say
,
'
I
have
never
done
anything
of
that
sort
with
any
*NL*
woman
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
repeated
his
words
like
a
lesson
learned
by
rote
,
and
as
though
she
*NL*
hoped
,
thereby
,
to
be
rid
of
him
:
``
I
have
never
done
anything
of
that
*NL*
sort
with
any
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
swear
it
to
me
on
your
Laghetto
medal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
knew
that
Odette
would
never
perjure
herself
on
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
do
make
me
so
miserable
,
''
she
cried
,
with
a
jerk
of
her
body
*NL*
as
though
to
shake
herself
free
of
the
constraint
of
his
question
.
``
Have
*NL*
you
nearly
done
?
What
is
the
matter
with
you
to-day
?
You
seem
to
have
*NL*
made
up
your
mind
that
I
am
to
be
forced
to
hate
you
,
to
curse
you
!
*NL*
Look
,
I
was
anxious
to
be
friends
with
you
again
,
for
us
to
have
a
nice
*NL*
time
together
,
like
the
old
days
;
and
this
is
all
the
thanks
I
get
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
would
not
let
her
go
,
but
sat
there
like
a
surgeon
who
waits
*NL*
for
a
spasm
to
subside
that
has
interrupted
his
operation
but
need
not
*NL*
make
him
abandon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
wrong
in
supposing
that
I
bear
you
the
least
ill-will
in
*NL*
the
world
,
Odette
,
''
he
began
with
a
persuasive
and
deceitful
gentleness
.
*NL*
``
I
never
speak
to
you
except
of
what
I
already
know
,
and
I
always
know
a
*NL*
great
deal
more
than
I
say
.
But
you
alone
can
mollify
by
your
confession
*NL*
what
makes
me
hate
you
so
long
as
it
has
been
reported
to
me
only
by
*NL*
other
people
.
My
anger
with
you
is
never
due
to
your
actions
--
I
can
*NL*
and
do
forgive
you
everything
because
I
love
you
--
but
to
your
*NL*
untruthfulness
,
the
ridiculous
untruthfulness
which
makes
you
persist
in
*NL*
denying
things
which
I
know
to
be
true
.
How
can
you
expect
that
I
shall
*NL*
continue
to
love
you
,
when
I
see
you
maintain
,
when
I
hear
you
swear
to
*NL*
me
a
thing
which
I
know
to
be
false
?
Odette
,
do
not
prolong
this
moment
*NL*
which
is
torturing
us
both
.
If
you
are
willing
to
end
it
at
once
,
you
*NL*
shall
be
free
of
it
for
ever
.
Tell
me
,
upon
your
medal
,
yes
or
no
,
*NL*
whether
you
have
ever
done
those
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
on
earth
can
I
tell
?
''
she
was
furious
.
``
Perhaps
I
have
,
ever
so
*NL*
long
ago
,
when
I
did
n't
know
what
I
was
doing
,
perhaps
two
or
three
*NL*
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
had
prepared
himself
for
all
possibilities
.
Reality
must
,
*NL*
therefore
,
be
something
which
bears
no
relation
to
possibilities
,
*NL*
any
more
than
the
stab
of
a
knife
in
one
's
body
bears
to
the
gradual
*NL*
movement
of
the
clouds
overhead
,
since
those
words
``
two
or
three
times
''
*NL*
carved
,
as
it
were
,
a
cross
upon
the
living
tissues
of
his
heart
.
A
*NL*
strange
thing
,
indeed
,
that
those
words
,
``
two
or
three
times
,
''
nothing
*NL*
more
than
a
few
words
,
words
uttered
in
the
air
,
at
a
distance
,
could
so
*NL*
lacerate
a
man
's
heart
,
as
if
they
had
actually
pierced
it
,
could
sicken
*NL*
a
man
,
like
a
poison
that
he
had
drunk
.
Instinctively
Swann
thought
of
*NL*
the
remark
that
he
had
heard
at
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
:
``
I
have
never
*NL*
seen
anything
to
beat
it
since
the
table-turning
.
''
The
agony
that
he
now
*NL*
suffered
in
no
way
resembled
what
he
had
supposed
.
Not
only
because
,
in
*NL*
the
hours
when
he
most
entirely
mistrusted
her
,
he
had
rarely
imagined
*NL*
such
a
culmination
of
evil
,
but
because
,
even
when
he
did
imagine
that
*NL*
offence
,
it
remained
vague
,
uncertain
,
was
not
clothed
in
the
particular
*NL*
horror
which
had
escaped
with
the
words
``
perhaps
two
or
three
times
,
''
*NL*
was
not
armed
with
that
specific
cruelty
,
as
different
from
anything
*NL*
that
he
had
known
as
a
new
malady
by
which
one
is
attacked
for
the
first
*NL*
time
.
And
yet
this
Odette
,
from
whom
all
this
evil
sprang
,
was
no
less
*NL*
dear
to
him
,
was
,
on
the
contrary
,
more
precious
,
as
if
,
in
proportion
*NL*
as
his
sufferings
increased
,
there
increased
at
the
same
time
the
price
*NL*
of
the
sedative
,
of
the
antidote
which
this
woman
alone
possessed
.
He
*NL*
wished
to
pay
her
more
attention
,
as
one
attends
to
a
disease
which
*NL*
one
discovers
,
suddenly
,
to
have
grown
more
serious
.
He
wished
that
*NL*
the
horrible
thing
which
,
she
had
told
him
,
she
had
done
``
two
or
three
*NL*
times
''
might
be
prevented
from
occurring
again
.
To
ensure
that
,
he
must
*NL*
watch
over
Odette
.
People
often
say
that
,
by
pointing
out
to
a
man
the
*NL*
faults
of
his
mistress
,
you
succeed
only
in
strengthening
his
attachment
*NL*
to
her
,
because
he
does
not
believe
you
;
yet
how
much
more
so
if
he
*NL*
does
!
But
,
Swann
asked
himself
,
how
could
he
manage
to
protect
her
?
He
*NL*
might
perhaps
be
able
to
preserve
her
from
the
contamination
of
any
*NL*
one
woman
,
but
there
were
hundreds
of
other
women
;
and
he
realised
how
*NL*
insane
had
been
his
ambition
when
he
had
begun
-LRB-
on
the
evening
when
*NL*
he
had
failed
to
find
Odette
at
the
Verdurins
'
-RRB-
to
desire
the
*NL*
possession
--
as
if
that
were
ever
possible
--
of
another
person
.
Happily
*NL*
for
Swann
,
beneath
the
mass
of
suffering
which
had
invaded
his
soul
like
*NL*
a
conquering
horde
of
barbarians
,
there
lay
a
natural
foundation
,
older
,
*NL*
more
placid
,
and
silently
laborious
,
like
the
cells
of
an
injured
organ
*NL*
which
at
once
set
to
work
to
repair
the
damaged
tissues
,
or
the
muscles
*NL*
of
a
paralysed
limb
which
tend
to
recover
their
former
movements
.
These
*NL*
older
,
these
autochthonous
in-dwellers
in
his
soul
absorbed
all
Swann
's
*NL*
strength
,
for
a
while
,
in
that
obscure
task
of
reparation
which
gives
*NL*
one
an
illusory
sense
of
repose
during
convalescence
,
or
after
an
*NL*
operation
.
This
time
it
was
not
so
much
--
as
it
ordinarily
was
--
in
*NL*
Swann
's
brain
that
the
slackening
of
tension
due
to
exhaustion
took
*NL*
effect
,
it
was
rather
in
his
heart
.
But
all
the
things
in
life
that
have
*NL*
once
existed
tend
to
recur
,
and
,
like
a
dying
animal
that
is
once
more
*NL*
stirred
by
the
throes
of
a
convulsion
which
was
,
apparently
,
ended
,
upon
*NL*
Swann
's
heart
,
spared
for
a
moment
only
,
the
same
agony
returned
of
its
*NL*
own
accord
to
trace
the
same
cross
again
.
He
remembered
those
moonlit
*NL*
evenings
,
when
,
leaning
back
in
the
victoria
that
was
taking
him
to
*NL*
the
Rue
La
P√©rouse
,
he
would
cultivate
with
voluptuous
enjoyment
the
*NL*
emotions
of
a
man
in
love
,
ignorant
of
the
poisoned
fruit
that
such
*NL*
emotions
must
inevitably
bear
.
But
all
those
thoughts
lasted
for
no
more
*NL*
than
a
second
,
the
time
that
it
took
him
to
raise
his
hand
to
his
heart
,
*NL*
to
draw
breath
again
and
to
contrive
to
smile
,
so
as
to
dissemble
*NL*
his
torment
.
Already
he
had
begun
to
put
further
questions
.
For
his
*NL*
jealousy
,
which
had
taken
an
amount
of
trouble
,
such
as
no
enemy
would
*NL*
have
incurred
,
to
strike
him
this
mortal
blow
,
to
make
him
forcibly
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
most
cruel
pain
that
he
had
ever
known
,
his
jealousy
*NL*
was
not
satisfied
that
he
had
yet
suffered
enough
,
and
sought
to
expose
*NL*
his
bosom
to
an
even
deeper
wound
.
Like
an
evil
deity
,
his
jealousy
was
*NL*
inspiring
Swann
,
was
thrusting
him
on
towards
destruction
.
It
was
not
*NL*
his
fault
,
but
Odette
's
alone
,
if
at
first
his
punishment
was
not
more
*NL*
severe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
darling
,
''
he
began
again
,
``
it
's
all
over
now
;
was
it
with
anyone
I
*NL*
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
swear
it
was
n't
;
besides
,
I
think
I
exaggerated
,
I
never
really
*NL*
went
as
far
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
,
and
resumed
with
:
``
Just
as
you
like
.
It
does
n't
really
*NL*
matter
,
but
it
's
unfortunate
that
you
ca
n't
give
me
any
name
.
If
I
were
*NL*
able
to
form
an
idea
of
the
person
that
would
prevent
my
ever
thinking
*NL*
of
her
again
.
I
say
it
for
your
own
sake
,
because
then
I
should
n't
*NL*
bother
you
any
more
about
it
.
It
's
so
soothing
to
be
able
to
form
a
*NL*
clear
picture
of
things
in
one
's
mind
.
What
is
really
terrible
is
what
*NL*
one
can
not
imagine
.
But
you
've
been
so
sweet
to
me
;
I
do
n't
want
to
tire
*NL*
you
.
I
do
thank
you
,
with
all
my
heart
,
for
all
the
good
that
you
have
*NL*
done
me
.
I
've
quite
finished
now
.
Only
one
word
more
:
how
many
times
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Charles
!
ca
n't
you
see
,
you
're
killing
me
?
It
's
all
ever
so
long
*NL*
ago
.
I
've
never
given
it
a
thought
.
Anyone
would
say
that
you
were
*NL*
positively
trying
to
put
those
ideas
into
my
head
again
.
And
then
you
'd
*NL*
be
a
lot
better
off
!
''
she
concluded
,
with
unconscious
stupidity
but
with
*NL*
intentional
malice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
wished
to
know
whether
it
had
been
since
I
knew
you
.
It
's
only
*NL*
natural
.
Did
it
happen
here
,
ever
?
You
ca
n't
give
me
any
particular
*NL*
evening
,
so
that
I
can
remind
myself
what
I
was
doing
at
the
time
?
You
*NL*
understand
,
surely
,
that
it
's
not
possible
that
you
do
n't
remember
with
*NL*
whom
,
Odette
,
my
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
know
;
really
,
I
do
n't
.
I
think
it
was
in
the
Bois
,
one
*NL*
evening
when
you
came
to
meet
us
on
the
Island
.
You
had
been
dining
with
*NL*
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
''
she
added
,
happy
to
be
able
to
furnish
him
*NL*
with
an
exact
detail
,
which
testified
to
her
veracity
.
``
At
the
next
*NL*
table
there
was
a
woman
whom
I
had
n't
seen
for
ever
so
long
.
She
said
to
*NL*
me
,
`
Come
along
round
behind
the
rock
,
there
,
and
look
at
the
moonlight
*NL*
on
the
water
!
'
At
first
I
just
yawned
,
and
said
,
`
No
,
I
'm
too
tired
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
quite
happy
where
I
am
,
thank
you
.
'
She
swore
there
'd
never
been
*NL*
anything
like
it
in
the
way
of
moonlight
.
`
I
've
heard
that
tale
before
,
'
*NL*
I
said
to
her
;
you
see
,
I
knew
quite
well
what
she
was
after
.
''
Odette
*NL*
narrated
this
episode
almost
as
if
it
were
a
joke
,
either
because
it
*NL*
appeared
to
her
to
be
quite
natural
,
or
because
she
thought
that
she
was
*NL*
thereby
minimising
its
importance
,
or
else
so
as
not
to
appear
ashamed
.
*NL*
But
,
catching
sight
of
Swann
's
face
,
she
changed
her
tone
,
and
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
fiend
!
''
she
flung
at
him
,
``
you
enjoy
tormenting
me
,
making
me
*NL*
tell
you
lies
,
just
so
that
you
'll
leave
me
in
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
second
blow
struck
at
Swann
was
even
more
excruciating
than
the
*NL*
first
.
Never
had
he
supposed
it
to
have
been
so
recent
an
affair
,
hidden
*NL*
from
his
eyes
that
had
been
too
innocent
to
discern
it
,
not
in
a
past
*NL*
which
he
had
never
known
,
but
in
evenings
which
he
so
well
remembered
,
*NL*
which
he
had
lived
through
with
Odette
,
of
which
he
had
supposed
himself
*NL*
to
have
such
an
intimate
,
such
an
exhaustive
knowledge
,
and
which
now
*NL*
assumed
,
retrospectively
,
an
aspect
of
cunning
and
deceit
and
cruelty
.
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
them
parted
,
suddenly
,
a
gaping
chasm
,
that
moment
on
*NL*
the
Island
in
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
Without
being
intelligent
,
Odette
*NL*
had
the
charm
of
being
natural
.
She
had
recounted
,
she
had
acted
the
*NL*
little
scene
with
so
much
simplicity
that
Swann
,
as
he
gasped
for
*NL*
breath
,
could
vividly
see
it
:
Odette
yawning
,
the
``
rock
there
,
''
...
He
*NL*
could
hear
her
answer
--
alas
,
how
lightheartedly
--
``
I
've
heard
that
tale
*NL*
before
!
''
He
felt
that
she
would
tell
him
nothing
more
that
evening
,
that
*NL*
no
further
revelation
was
to
be
expected
for
the
present
.
He
was
silent
*NL*
for
a
time
,
then
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
darling
,
you
must
forgive
me
;
I
know
,
I
am
hurting
you
*NL*
dreadfully
,
but
it
's
all
over
now
;
I
shall
never
think
of
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
saw
that
his
eyes
remained
fixed
upon
the
things
that
he
did
not
*NL*
know
,
and
on
that
past
era
of
their
love
,
monotonous
and
soothing
in
his
*NL*
memory
because
it
was
vague
,
and
now
rent
,
as
with
a
sword-wound
,
by
the
*NL*
news
of
that
minute
on
the
Island
in
the
Bois
,
by
moonlight
,
while
he
*NL*
was
dining
with
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
.
But
he
had
so
far
acquired
*NL*
the
habit
of
finding
life
interesting
--
of
marvelling
at
the
strange
*NL*
discoveries
that
there
were
to
be
made
in
it
--
that
even
while
he
was
*NL*
suffering
so
acutely
that
he
did
not
believe
it
possible
to
endure
such
*NL*
agony
for
any
length
of
time
,
he
was
saying
to
himself
:
``
Life
is
indeed
*NL*
astonishing
,
and
holds
some
fine
surprises
;
it
appears
that
vice
is
far
*NL*
more
common
than
one
has
been
led
to
believe
.
Here
is
a
woman
in
whom
*NL*
I
had
absolute
confidence
,
who
looks
so
simple
,
so
honest
,
who
,
in
any
*NL*
case
,
even
allowing
that
her
morals
are
not
strict
,
seemed
quite
normal
*NL*
and
healthy
in
her
tastes
and
inclinations
.
I
receive
a
most
improbable
*NL*
accusation
,
I
question
her
,
and
the
little
that
she
admits
reveals
far
*NL*
more
than
I
could
ever
have
suspected
.
''
But
he
could
not
confine
himself
*NL*
to
these
detached
observations
.
He
sought
to
form
an
exact
estimate
of
*NL*
the
importance
of
what
she
had
just
told
him
,
so
as
to
know
whether
he
*NL*
might
conclude
that
she
had
done
these
things
often
,
and
was
likely
to
*NL*
do
them
again
.
He
repeated
her
words
to
himself
:
``
I
knew
quite
well
what
*NL*
she
was
after
.
''
``
Two
or
three
times
.
''
``
I
've
heard
that
tale
before
.
''
But
*NL*
they
did
not
reappear
in
his
memory
unarmed
;
each
of
them
held
a
knife
*NL*
with
which
it
stabbed
him
afresh
.
For
a
long
time
,
like
a
sick
man
*NL*
who
can
not
restrain
himself
from
attempting
,
every
minute
,
to
make
the
*NL*
movement
that
,
he
knows
,
will
hurt
him
,
he
kept
on
murmuring
to
himself
:
*NL*
``
I
'm
quite
happy
where
I
am
,
thank
you
,
''
``
I
've
heard
that
tale
before
,
''
*NL*
but
the
pain
was
so
intense
that
he
was
obliged
to
stop
.
He
was
amazed
*NL*
to
find
that
actions
which
he
had
always
,
hitherto
,
judged
so
lightly
,
*NL*
had
dismissed
,
indeed
,
with
a
laugh
,
should
have
become
as
serious
to
*NL*
him
as
a
disease
which
might
easily
prove
fatal
.
He
knew
any
number
*NL*
of
women
whom
he
could
ask
to
keep
an
eye
on
Odette
,
but
how
was
he
to
*NL*
expect
them
to
adjust
themselves
to
his
new
point
of
view
,
and
not
to
*NL*
remain
at
that
which
for
so
long
had
been
his
own
,
which
had
always
*NL*
guided
him
in
his
voluptuous
existence
;
not
to
say
to
him
with
a
smile
:
*NL*
``
You
jealous
monster
,
wanting
to
rob
other
people
of
their
pleasure
!
''
*NL*
By
what
trap-door
,
suddenly
lowered
,
had
he
-LRB-
who
had
never
found
,
in
the
*NL*
old
days
,
in
his
love
for
Odette
,
any
but
the
most
refined
of
pleasures
-RRB-
*NL*
been
precipitated
into
this
new
circle
of
hell
from
which
he
could
not
*NL*
see
how
he
was
ever
to
escape
.
Poor
Odette
!
He
wished
her
no
harm
.
She
*NL*
was
but
half
to
blame
.
Had
he
not
been
told
that
it
was
her
own
mother
*NL*
who
had
sold
her
,
when
she
was
still
little
more
than
a
child
,
at
Nice
,
*NL*
to
a
wealthy
Englishman
?
But
what
an
agonising
truth
was
now
contained
*NL*
for
him
in
those
lines
of
Alfred
de
Vigny
's
_
Journal
d'un
Po√®te
_
which
*NL*
he
had
previously
read
without
emotion
:
``
When
one
feels
oneself
smitten
*NL*
by
love
for
a
woman
,
one
ought
to
say
to
oneself
,
`
What
are
`
her
*NL*
surroundings
?
What
has
been
her
life
?
'
All
one
's
future
happiness
lies
*NL*
in
the
answer
.
''
Swann
was
astonished
that
such
simple
phrases
,
spelt
*NL*
over
in
his
mind
as
,
``
I
've
heard
that
tale
before
,
''
or
``
I
knew
quite
*NL*
well
what
she
was
after
,
''
could
cause
him
so
much
pain
.
But
he
realised
*NL*
that
what
he
had
mistaken
for
simple
phrases
were
indeed
parts
of
the
*NL*
panoply
which
held
and
could
inflict
on
him
the
anguish
that
he
had
felt
*NL*
while
Odette
was
telling
her
story
.
For
it
was
the
same
anguish
that
he
*NL*
now
was
feeling
afresh
.
It
was
no
good
,
his
knowing
now
,
--
indeed
,
it
*NL*
was
no
good
,
as
time
went
on
,
his
having
partly
forgotten
and
altogether
*NL*
forgiven
the
offence
--
whenever
he
repeated
her
words
his
old
anguish
*NL*
refashioned
him
as
he
had
been
before
Odette
began
to
speak
:
ignorant
,
*NL*
trustful
;
his
merciless
jealousy
placed
him
once
again
,
so
that
he
might
*NL*
be
effectively
wounded
by
Odette
's
admission
,
in
the
position
of
a
man
*NL*
who
does
not
yet
know
the
truth
;
and
after
several
months
this
old
story
*NL*
would
still
dumbfounder
him
,
like
a
sudden
revelation
.
He
marvelled
*NL*
at
the
terrible
recreative
power
of
his
memory
.
It
was
only
by
the
*NL*
weakening
of
that
generative
force
,
whose
fecundity
diminishes
as
age
*NL*
creeps
over
one
,
that
he
could
hope
for
a
relaxation
of
his
torments
.
*NL*
But
,
as
soon
as
the
power
that
any
one
of
Odette
's
sentences
had
to
make
*NL*
Swann
suffer
seemed
to
be
nearly
exhausted
,
lo
and
behold
another
,
one
*NL*
of
those
to
which
he
had
hitherto
paid
least
attention
,
almost
a
*NL*
new
sentence
,
came
to
relieve
the
first
,
and
to
strike
at
him
with
*NL*
undiminished
force
.
The
memory
of
the
evening
on
which
he
had
dined
with
*NL*
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
was
painful
to
him
,
but
it
was
no
more
than
*NL*
the
centre
,
the
core
of
his
pain
.
That
radiated
vaguely
round
about
it
,
*NL*
overflowing
into
all
the
preceding
and
following
days
.
And
on
whatever
*NL*
point
in
it
he
might
intend
his
memory
to
rest
,
it
was
the
whole
of
that
*NL*
season
,
during
which
the
Verdurins
had
so
often
gone
to
dine
upon
the
*NL*
Island
in
the
Bois
,
that
sprang
back
to
hurt
him
.
So
violently
,
that
by
*NL*
slow
degrees
the
curiosity
which
his
jealousy
was
ever
exciting
in
him
*NL*
was
neutralised
by
his
fear
of
the
fresh
tortures
which
he
would
be
*NL*
inflicting
upon
himself
were
he
to
satisfy
it
.
He
recognised
that
all
*NL*
the
period
of
Odette
's
life
which
had
elapsed
before
she
first
met
him
,
*NL*
a
period
of
which
he
had
never
sought
to
form
any
picture
in
his
mind
,
*NL*
was
not
the
featureless
abstraction
which
he
could
vaguely
see
,
but
had
*NL*
consisted
of
so
many
definite
,
dated
years
,
each
crowded
with
concrete
*NL*
incidents
.
But
were
he
to
learn
more
of
them
,
he
feared
lest
her
past
,
*NL*
now
colourless
,
fluid
and
supportable
,
might
assume
a
tangible
,
an
*NL*
obscene
form
,
with
individual
and
diabolical
features
.
And
he
continued
*NL*
to
refrain
from
seeking
a
conception
of
it
,
not
any
longer
now
from
*NL*
laziness
of
mind
,
but
from
fear
of
suffering
.
He
hoped
that
,
some
day
,
*NL*
he
might
be
able
to
hear
the
Island
in
the
Bois
,
or
the
Princesse
des
*NL*
Laumes
mentioned
without
feeling
any
twinge
of
that
old
rending
pain
;
*NL*
meanwhile
he
thought
it
imprudent
to
provoke
Odette
into
furnishing
him
*NL*
with
fresh
sentences
,
with
the
names
of
more
places
and
people
and
of
*NL*
different
events
,
which
,
when
his
malady
was
still
scarcely
healed
,
*NL*
would
make
it
break
out
again
in
another
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
often
enough
,
the
things
that
he
did
not
know
,
that
he
dreaded
,
*NL*
now
,
to
learn
,
it
was
Odette
herself
who
,
spontaneously
and
without
*NL*
thought
of
what
she
did
,
revealed
them
to
him
;
for
the
gap
which
her
*NL*
vices
made
between
her
actual
life
and
the
comparatively
innocent
life
*NL*
which
Swann
had
believed
,
and
often
still
believed
his
mistress
to
lead
,
*NL*
was
far
wider
than
she
knew
.
A
vicious
person
,
always
affecting
the
same
*NL*
air
of
virtue
before
people
whom
he
is
anxious
to
keep
from
having
any
*NL*
suspicion
of
his
vices
,
has
no
register
,
no
gauge
at
hand
from
which
*NL*
he
may
ascertain
how
far
those
vices
-LRB-
their
continuous
growth
being
*NL*
imperceptible
by
himself
-RRB-
have
gradually
segregated
him
from
the
normal
*NL*
ways
of
life
.
In
the
course
of
their
cohabitation
,
in
Odette
's
mind
,
*NL*
with
the
memory
of
those
of
her
actions
which
she
concealed
from
Swann
,
*NL*
her
other
,
her
innocuous
actions
were
gradually
coloured
,
infected
*NL*
by
these
,
without
her
being
able
to
detect
anything
strange
in
them
,
*NL*
without
their
causing
any
explosion
in
the
particular
region
of
herself
*NL*
in
which
she
made
them
live
,
but
when
she
related
them
to
Swann
,
he
was
*NL*
overwhelmed
by
the
revelation
of
the
duplicity
to
which
they
pointed
.
*NL*
One
day
,
he
was
trying
--
without
hurting
Odette
--
to
discover
from
her
*NL*
whether
she
had
ever
had
any
dealings
with
procuresses
.
He
was
,
as
a
*NL*
matter
of
fact
,
convinced
that
she
had
not
;
the
anonymous
letter
had
*NL*
put
the
idea
into
his
mind
,
but
in
a
purely
mechanical
way
;
it
had
been
*NL*
received
there
with
no
credulity
,
but
it
had
,
for
all
that
,
remained
*NL*
there
,
and
Swann
,
wishing
to
be
rid
of
the
burden
--
a
dead
weight
,
but
*NL*
none
the
less
disturbing
--
of
this
suspicion
,
hoped
that
Odette
would
now
*NL*
extirpate
it
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no
!
Not
that
they
do
n't
simply
persecute
me
to
go
to
them
,
''
*NL*
her
smile
revealed
a
gratified
vanity
which
she
no
longer
saw
that
it
*NL*
was
impossible
should
appear
legitimate
to
Swann
.
``
There
was
one
of
them
*NL*
waited
more
than
two
hours
for
me
yesterday
,
said
she
would
give
me
any
*NL*
money
I
asked
.
It
seems
,
there
's
an
Ambassador
who
said
to
her
,
`
I
'll
*NL*
kill
myself
if
you
do
n't
bring
her
to
me
'
--
meaning
me
!
They
told
her
I
'd
*NL*
gone
out
,
but
she
waited
and
waited
,
and
in
the
end
I
had
to
go
myself
*NL*
and
speak
to
her
,
before
she
'd
go
away
.
I
do
wish
you
could
have
seen
*NL*
the
way
I
tackled
her
;
my
maid
was
in
the
next
room
,
listening
,
and
told
*NL*
me
I
shouted
fit
to
bring
the
house
down
:
--
`
But
when
you
hear
me
say
*NL*
that
I
do
n't
want
to
!
The
idea
of
such
a
thing
,
I
do
n't
like
it
at
all
!
*NL*
I
should
hope
I
'm
still
free
to
do
as
I
please
and
when
I
please
and
*NL*
where
I
please
!
If
I
needed
the
money
,
I
could
understand
...
'
The
porter
*NL*
has
orders
not
to
let
her
in
again
;
he
will
tell
her
that
I
am
out
of
*NL*
town
.
Oh
,
I
do
wish
I
could
have
had
you
hidden
somewhere
in
the
room
*NL*
while
I
was
talking
to
her
.
I
know
,
you
'd
have
been
pleased
,
my
dear
.
*NL*
There
's
some
good
in
your
little
Odette
,
you
see
,
after
all
,
though
*NL*
people
do
say
such
dreadful
things
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
her
very
admissions
--
when
she
made
any
--
of
faults
which
she
*NL*
supposed
him
to
have
discovered
,
rather
served
Swann
as
a
starting-point
*NL*
for
fresh
doubts
than
they
put
an
end
to
the
old
.
For
her
admissions
*NL*
never
exactly
coincided
with
his
doubts
.
In
vain
might
Odette
expurgate
*NL*
her
confession
of
all
its
essential
part
,
there
would
remain
in
the
*NL*
accessories
something
which
Swann
had
never
yet
imagined
,
which
crushed
*NL*
him
anew
,
and
was
to
enable
him
to
alter
the
terms
of
the
problem
of
his
*NL*
jealousy
.
And
these
admissions
he
could
never
forget
.
His
spirit
carried
*NL*
them
along
,
cast
them
aside
,
then
cradled
them
again
in
its
bosom
,
like
*NL*
corpses
in
a
river
.
And
they
poisoned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
to
him
once
of
a
visit
that
Forcheville
had
paid
her
on
the
*NL*
day
of
the
Paris-Murcie
F√™te
.
``
What
!
you
knew
him
as
long
ago
as
that
?
*NL*
Oh
,
yes
,
of
course
you
did
,
''
he
corrected
himself
,
so
as
not
to
shew
*NL*
that
he
had
been
ignorant
of
the
fact
.
And
suddenly
he
began
to
tremble
*NL*
at
the
thought
that
,
on
the
day
of
the
Paris-Murcie
F√™te
,
when
he
had
*NL*
received
that
letter
which
he
had
so
carefully
preserved
,
she
had
been
*NL*
having
luncheon
,
perhaps
,
with
Forcheville
at
the
Maison
d'Or
.
She
swore
*NL*
that
she
had
not
.
``
Still
,
the
Maison
d'Or
reminds
me
of
something
or
*NL*
other
which
,
I
knew
at
the
time
,
was
n't
true
,
''
he
pursued
,
hoping
to
*NL*
frighten
her
.
``
Yes
that
I
had
n't
been
there
at
all
that
evening
when
I
*NL*
told
you
I
had
just
come
from
there
,
and
you
had
been
looking
for
me
*NL*
at
Pr√©vost
's
,
''
she
replied
-LRB-
judging
by
his
manner
that
he
knew
-RRB-
with
a
*NL*
firmness
that
was
based
not
so
much
upon
cynicism
as
upon
timidity
,
a
*NL*
fear
of
crossing
Swann
,
which
her
own
self-respect
made
her
anxious
to
*NL*
conceal
,
and
a
desire
to
shew
him
that
she
could
be
perfectly
frank
if
*NL*
she
chose
.
And
so
she
struck
him
with
all
the
sharpness
and
force
of
a
*NL*
headsman
wielding
his
axe
,
and
yet
could
not
be
charged
with
cruelty
,
*NL*
since
she
was
quite
unconscious
of
hurting
him
;
she
even
began
to
laugh
,
*NL*
though
this
may
perhaps
,
it
is
true
,
have
been
chiefly
to
keep
him
from
*NL*
thinking
that
she
was
ashamed
,
at
all
,
or
confused
.
``
It
's
quite
true
,
I
*NL*
had
n't
been
to
the
Maison
Dor√©e
.
I
was
coming
away
from
Forcheville
's
.
I
*NL*
had
,
really
,
been
to
Pr√©vost
's
--
that
was
n't
a
story
--
and
he
met
me
there
*NL*
and
asked
me
to
come
in
and
look
at
his
prints
.
But
some
one
else
came
*NL*
to
see
him
.
I
told
you
that
I
was
coming
from
the
Maison
d'Or
because
I
*NL*
was
afraid
you
might
be
angry
with
me
.
It
was
rather
nice
of
me
,
really
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
see
?
I
admit
,
I
did
wrong
,
but
at
least
I
'm
telling
you
all
*NL*
about
it
now
,
a
'n'
t
I
?
What
have
I
to
gain
by
not
telling
you
,
straight
,
*NL*
that
I
lunched
with
him
on
the
day
of
the
Paris-Murcie
F√™te
,
if
it
were
*NL*
true
?
Especially
as
at
that
time
we
did
n't
know
one
another
quite
so
*NL*
well
as
we
do
now
,
did
we
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
back
at
her
with
the
sudden
,
craven
weakness
of
the
utterly
*NL*
spiritless
creature
which
these
crushing
words
had
made
of
him
.
And
so
,
*NL*
even
in
the
months
of
which
he
had
never
dared
to
think
again
,
because
*NL*
they
had
been
too
happy
,
in
those
months
when
she
had
loved
him
,
she
was
*NL*
already
lying
to
him
!
Besides
that
moment
-LRB-
that
first
evening
on
which
*NL*
they
had
``
done
a
cattleya
''
-RRB-
when
she
had
told
him
that
she
was
coming
*NL*
from
the
Maison
Dor√©e
,
how
many
others
must
there
have
been
,
each
*NL*
of
them
covering
a
falsehood
of
which
Swann
had
had
no
suspicion
.
He
*NL*
recalled
how
she
had
said
to
him
once
:
``
I
need
only
tell
Mme.
Verdurin
*NL*
that
my
dress
was
n't
ready
,
or
that
my
cab
came
late
.
There
is
always
*NL*
some
excuse
.
''
From
himself
too
,
probably
,
many
times
when
she
had
glibly
*NL*
uttered
such
words
as
explain
a
delay
or
justify
an
alteration
of
the
*NL*
hour
fixed
for
a
meeting
,
those
moments
must
have
hidden
,
without
his
*NL*
having
the
least
inkling
of
it
at
the
time
,
an
engagement
that
she
had
*NL*
had
with
some
other
man
,
some
man
to
whom
she
had
said
:
``
I
need
only
*NL*
tell
Swann
that
my
dress
was
n't
ready
,
or
that
my
cab
came
late
.
There
*NL*
is
always
some
excuse
.
''
And
beneath
all
his
most
pleasant
memories
,
*NL*
beneath
the
simplest
words
that
Odette
had
ever
spoken
to
him
in
those
*NL*
old
days
,
words
which
he
had
believed
as
though
they
were
the
words
of
*NL*
a
Gospel
,
beneath
her
daily
actions
which
she
had
recounted
to
him
,
*NL*
beneath
the
most
ordinary
places
,
her
dressmaker
's
flat
,
the
Avenue
du
*NL*
Bois
,
the
Hippodrome
,
he
could
feel
-LRB-
dissembled
there
,
by
virtue
of
that
*NL*
temporal
superfluity
which
,
after
the
most
detailed
account
of
how
a
day
*NL*
has
been
spent
,
always
leaves
something
over
,
that
may
serve
as
a
hiding
*NL*
place
for
certain
unconfessed
actions
-RRB-
,
he
could
feel
the
insinuation
of
*NL*
a
possible
undercurrent
of
falsehood
which
debased
for
him
all
that
*NL*
had
remained
most
precious
,
his
happiest
evenings
,
the
Rue
La
P√©rouse
*NL*
itself
,
which
Odette
must
constantly
have
been
leaving
at
other
hours
*NL*
than
those
of
which
she
told
him
;
extending
the
power
of
the
dark
horror
*NL*
that
had
gripped
him
when
he
had
heard
her
admission
with
regard
to
*NL*
the
Maison
Dor√©e
,
and
,
like
the
obscene
creatures
in
the
`
Desolation
of
*NL*
Nineveh
,
'
shattering
,
stone
by
stone
,
the
whole
edifice
of
his
past
...
*NL*
If
,
now
,
he
turned
aside
whenever
his
memory
repeated
the
cruel
name
of
*NL*
the
Maison
Dor√©e
it
was
because
that
name
recalled
to
him
,
no
longer
,
*NL*
as
,
such
a
little
time
since
,
at
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
party
,
the
good
*NL*
fortune
which
he
long
had
lost
,
but
a
misfortune
of
which
he
was
now
*NL*
first
aware
.
Then
it
befell
the
Maison
Dor√©e
,
as
it
had
befallen
the
*NL*
Island
in
the
Bois
,
that
gradually
its
name
ceased
to
trouble
him
.
*NL*
For
what
we
suppose
to
be
our
love
,
our
jealousy
are
,
neither
of
them
,
*NL*
single
,
continuous
and
individual
passions
.
They
are
composed
of
an
*NL*
infinity
of
successive
loves
,
of
different
jealousies
,
each
of
which
is
*NL*
ephemeral
,
although
by
their
uninterrupted
multitude
they
give
us
the
*NL*
impression
of
continuity
,
the
illusion
of
unity
.
The
life
of
Swann
's
*NL*
love
,
the
fidelity
of
his
jealousy
,
were
formed
out
of
death
,
of
*NL*
infidelity
,
of
innumerable
desires
,
innumerable
doubts
,
all
of
which
*NL*
had
Odette
for
their
object
.
If
he
had
remained
for
any
length
of
time
*NL*
without
seeing
her
,
those
that
died
would
not
have
been
replaced
by
*NL*
others
.
But
the
presence
of
Odette
continued
to
sow
in
Swann
's
heart
*NL*
alternate
seeds
of
love
and
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
certain
evenings
she
would
suddenly
resume
towards
him
a
kindness
of
*NL*
which
she
would
warn
him
sternly
that
he
must
take
immediate
advantage
,
*NL*
under
penalty
of
not
seeing
it
repeated
for
years
to
come
;
he
must
*NL*
instantly
accompany
her
home
,
to
``
do
a
cattleya
,
''
and
the
desire
*NL*
which
she
pretended
to
have
for
him
was
so
sudden
,
so
inexplicable
,
so
*NL*
imperious
,
the
kisses
which
she
lavished
on
him
were
so
demonstrative
*NL*
and
so
unfamiliar
,
that
this
brutal
and
unnatural
fondness
made
Swann
*NL*
just
as
unhappy
as
any
lie
or
unkind
action
.
One
evening
when
he
had
*NL*
thus
,
in
obedience
to
her
command
,
gone
home
with
her
,
and
while
she
was
*NL*
interspersing
her
kisses
with
passionate
words
,
in
strange
contrast
to
*NL*
her
habitual
coldness
,
he
thought
suddenly
that
he
heard
a
sound
;
he
*NL*
rose
,
searched
everywhere
and
found
nobody
,
but
he
had
not
the
courage
*NL*
to
return
to
his
place
by
her
side
;
whereupon
she
,
in
a
towering
*NL*
rage
,
broke
a
vase
,
with
``
I
never
can
do
anything
right
with
you
,
*NL*
you
impossible
person
!
''
And
he
was
left
uncertain
whether
she
had
not
*NL*
actually
had
some
man
concealed
in
the
room
,
whose
jealousy
she
had
*NL*
wished
to
wound
,
or
else
to
inflame
his
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
repaired
to
`
gay
'
houses
,
hoping
to
learn
something
about
*NL*
Odette
,
although
he
dared
not
mention
her
name
.
``
I
have
a
little
thing
*NL*
here
,
you
're
sure
to
like
,
''
the
`
manageress
'
would
greet
him
,
and
he
*NL*
would
stay
for
an
hour
or
so
,
talking
dolefully
to
some
poor
girl
who
*NL*
sat
there
astonished
that
he
went
no
further
.
One
of
them
,
who
was
still
*NL*
quite
young
and
attractive
,
said
to
him
once
,
``
Of
course
,
what
I
should
*NL*
like
would
be
to
find
a
real
friend
,
then
he
might
be
quite
certain
,
*NL*
I
should
never
go
with
any
other
men
again
.
''
``
Indeed
,
do
you
think
it
*NL*
possible
for
a
woman
really
to
be
touched
by
a
man
's
being
in
love
with
*NL*
her
,
and
never
to
be
unfaithful
to
him
?
''
asked
Swann
anxiously
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
surely
!
It
all
depends
on
their
characters
!
''
Swann
could
not
help
making
*NL*
the
same
remarks
to
these
girls
as
would
have
delighted
the
Princesse
*NL*
des
Laumes
.
To
the
one
who
was
in
search
of
a
friend
he
said
,
with
a
*NL*
smile
:
``
But
how
nice
of
you
,
you
've
put
on
blue
eyes
,
to
go
with
*NL*
your
sash
.
''
``
And
you
too
,
you
've
got
blue
cuffs
on
.
''
``
What
a
charming
*NL*
conversation
we
are
having
,
for
a
place
of
this
sort
!
I
'm
not
boring
*NL*
you
,
am
I
;
or
keeping
you
?
''
``
No
,
I
've
nothing
to
do
,
thank
you
.
If
you
*NL*
bored
me
I
should
say
so
.
But
I
love
hearing
you
talk
.
''
``
I
am
highly
*NL*
flattered
...
Are
n't
we
behaving
prettily
?
''
he
asked
the
`
manageress
,
'
*NL*
who
had
just
looked
in
.
``
Why
,
yes
,
that
's
just
what
I
was
saying
to
*NL*
myself
,
how
sensibly
they
're
behaving
!
But
that
's
how
it
is
!
People
come
*NL*
to
my
house
now
,
just
to
talk
.
The
Prince
was
telling
me
,
only
the
other
*NL*
day
,
that
he
's
far
more
comfortable
here
than
with
his
wife
.
It
seems
*NL*
that
,
nowadays
,
all
the
society
ladies
are
like
that
;
a
perfect
scandal
,
*NL*
I
call
it
.
But
I
'll
leave
you
in
peace
now
,
I
know
when
I
'm
not
wanted
,
''
*NL*
she
ended
discreetly
,
and
left
Swann
with
the
girl
who
had
the
blue
*NL*
eyes
.
But
presently
he
rose
and
said
good-bye
to
her
.
She
had
ceased
to
*NL*
interest
him
.
She
did
not
know
Odette
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
having
been
ill
,
Dr.
Cottard
recommended
a
sea-voyage
;
*NL*
several
of
the
`
faithful
'
spoke
of
accompanying
him
;
the
Verdurins
could
*NL*
not
face
the
prospect
of
being
left
alone
in
Paris
,
so
first
of
all
*NL*
hired
,
and
finally
purchased
a
yacht
;
thus
Odette
was
constantly
going
*NL*
on
a
cruise
.
Whenever
she
had
been
away
for
any
length
of
time
,
Swann
*NL*
would
feel
that
he
was
beginning
to
detach
himself
from
her
,
but
,
as
*NL*
though
this
moral
distance
were
proportionate
to
the
physical
distance
*NL*
between
them
,
whenever
he
heard
that
Odette
had
returned
to
Paris
,
he
*NL*
could
not
rest
without
seeing
her
.
Once
,
when
they
had
gone
away
,
as
*NL*
everyone
thought
,
for
a
month
only
,
either
they
succumbed
to
a
series
*NL*
of
temptations
,
or
else
M.
Verdurin
had
cunningly
arranged
everything
*NL*
beforehand
,
to
please
his
wife
,
and
disclosed
his
plans
to
the
*NL*
`
faithful
'
only
as
time
went
on
;
anyhow
,
from
Algiers
they
flitted
to
*NL*
Tunis
;
then
to
Italy
,
Greece
,
Constantinople
,
Asia
Minor
.
They
had
been
*NL*
absent
for
nearly
a
year
,
and
Swann
felt
perfectly
at
ease
and
almost
*NL*
happy
.
Albeit
M.
Verdurin
had
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
pianist
and
*NL*
Dr.
Cottard
that
their
respective
aunt
and
patients
had
no
need
of
them
,
*NL*
and
that
,
in
any
event
,
it
was
most
rash
to
allow
Mme.
Cottard
to
return
*NL*
to
Paris
,
where
,
Mme.
Verdurin
assured
him
,
a
revolution
had
just
broken
*NL*
out
,
he
was
obliged
to
grant
them
their
liberty
at
Constantinople
.
And
*NL*
the
painter
came
home
with
them
.
One
day
,
shortly
after
the
return
of
*NL*
these
four
travellers
,
Swann
,
seeing
an
omnibus
approach
him
,
labelled
*NL*
`
Luxembourg
,
'
and
having
some
business
there
,
had
jumped
on
to
it
and
*NL*
had
found
himself
sitting
opposite
Mme.
Cottard
,
who
was
paying
a
round
*NL*
of
visits
to
people
whose
`
day
'
it
was
,
in
full
review
order
,
with
a
*NL*
plume
in
her
hat
,
a
silk
dress
,
a
muff
,
an
umbrella
-LRB-
which
do
for
a
*NL*
parasol
if
the
rain
kept
off
-RRB-
,
a
card-case
,
and
a
pair
of
white
gloves
*NL*
fresh
from
the
cleaners
.
Wearing
these
badges
of
rank
,
she
would
,
*NL*
in
fine
weather
,
go
on
foot
from
one
house
to
another
in
the
same
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
but
when
she
had
to
proceed
to
another
district
,
would
*NL*
make
use
of
a
transfer-ticket
on
the
omnibus
.
For
the
first
minute
or
*NL*
two
,
until
the
natural
courtesy
of
the
woman
broke
through
the
starched
*NL*
surface
of
the
doctor
's
-
wife
,
not
being
certain
,
either
,
whether
*NL*
she
ought
to
mention
the
Verdurins
before
Swann
,
she
produced
,
quite
*NL*
naturally
,
in
her
slow
and
awkward
,
but
not
unattractive
voice
,
which
,
*NL*
every
now
and
then
,
was
completely
drowned
by
the
rattling
of
the
*NL*
omnibus
,
topics
selected
from
those
which
she
had
picked
up
and
would
*NL*
repeat
in
each
of
the
score
of
houses
up
the
stairs
of
which
she
*NL*
clambered
in
the
course
of
an
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
n't
ask
you
,
M.
Swann
,
whether
a
man
so
much
in
the
movement
as
*NL*
yourself
has
been
to
the
Mirlitons
,
to
see
the
portrait
by
Machard
that
*NL*
the
whole
of
Paris
is
running
after
.
Well
,
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
*NL*
Whose
camp
are
you
in
,
those
who
bless
or
those
who
curse
?
It
's
the
*NL*
same
in
every
house
in
Paris
now
,
no
one
will
speak
of
anything
else
but
*NL*
Machard
's
portrait
;
you
are
n't
smart
,
you
are
n't
really
cultured
,
you
*NL*
are
n't
up-to-date
unless
you
give
an
opinion
on
Machard
's
portrait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
having
replied
that
he
had
not
seen
this
portrait
,
Mme.
Cottard
*NL*
was
afraid
that
she
might
have
hurt
his
feelings
by
obliging
him
to
*NL*
confess
the
omission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
quite
all
right
!
At
least
you
have
the
courage
to
be
quite
*NL*
frank
about
it
.
You
do
n't
consider
yourself
disgraced
because
you
*NL*
have
n't
seen
Machard
's
portrait
.
I
do
think
that
so
nice
of
you
.
Well
*NL*
now
,
I
have
seen
it
;
opinion
is
divided
,
you
know
,
there
are
some
people
*NL*
who
find
it
rather
laboured
,
like
whipped
cream
,
they
say
;
but
I
think
*NL*
it
's
just
ideal
.
Of
course
,
she
's
not
a
bit
like
the
blue
and
yellow
*NL*
ladies
that
our
friend
Biche
paints
.
That
's
quite
clear
.
But
I
must
tell
*NL*
you
,
perfectly
frankly
-LRB-
you
'll
think
me
dreadfully
old-fashioned
,
but
I
*NL*
always
say
just
what
I
think
-RRB-
,
that
I
do
n't
understand
his
work
.
I
can
*NL*
quite
see
the
good
points
there
are
in
his
portrait
of
my
husband
;
oh
,
*NL*
dear
me
,
yes
;
and
it
's
certainly
less
odd
than
most
of
what
he
does
,
*NL*
but
even
then
he
had
to
give
the
poor
man
a
blue
moustache
!
But
Machard
!
*NL*
Just
listen
to
this
now
,
the
husband
of
my
friend
,
I
am
on
my
way
to
see
*NL*
at
this
very
moment
-LRB-
which
has
given
me
the
very
great
pleasure
of
your
*NL*
company
-RRB-
,
has
promised
her
that
,
if
he
is
elected
to
the
Academy
-LRB-
he
*NL*
is
one
of
the
Doctor
's
colleagues
-RRB-
,
he
will
get
Machard
to
paint
her
*NL*
portrait
.
So
she
's
got
something
to
look
forward
to
!
I
have
another
*NL*
friend
who
insists
that
she
'd
rather
have
Leloir
.
I
'm
only
a
wretched
*NL*
Philistine
,
and
I
've
no
doubt
Leloir
has
perhaps
more
knowledge
of
*NL*
painting
even
than
Machard
.
But
I
do
think
that
the
most
important
*NL*
thing
about
a
portrait
,
especially
when
it
's
going
to
cost
ten
thousand
*NL*
francs
,
is
that
it
should
be
like
,
and
a
pleasant
likeness
,
if
you
know
*NL*
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
exhausted
this
topic
,
to
which
she
had
been
inspired
by
the
*NL*
loftiness
of
her
plume
,
the
monogram
on
her
card-case
,
the
little
number
*NL*
inked
inside
each
of
her
gloves
by
the
cleaner
,
and
the
difficulty
of
*NL*
speaking
to
Swann
about
the
Verdurins
,
Mme.
Cottard
,
seeing
that
they
*NL*
had
still
a
long
way
to
go
before
they
would
reach
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
Rue
Bonaparte
,
where
the
conductor
was
to
set
her
down
,
listened
to
the
*NL*
promptings
of
her
heart
,
which
counselled
other
words
than
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
ears
must
have
been
burning
,
''
she
ventured
,
``
while
we
were
on
the
*NL*
yacht
with
Mme.
Verdurin
.
We
were
talking
about
you
all
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
was
genuinely
astonished
,
for
he
supposed
that
his
name
was
never
*NL*
uttered
in
the
Verdurins
'
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
Mme.
Cottard
went
on
,
``
Mme.
de
Cr√©cy
was
there
;
need
I
say
*NL*
more
?
When
Odette
is
anywhere
it
's
never
long
before
she
begins
talking
*NL*
about
you
.
And
you
know
quite
well
,
it
is
n't
nasty
things
she
says
.
*NL*
What
!
you
do
n't
believe
me
!
''
she
went
on
,
noticing
that
Svrann
looked
*NL*
sceptical
.
And
,
carried
away
by
the
sincerity
of
her
conviction
,
without
*NL*
putting
any
evil
meaning
into
the
word
,
which
she
used
purely
in
the
*NL*
sense
in
which
one
employs
it
to
speak
of
the
affection
that
unites
a
*NL*
pair
of
friends
:
``
Why
,
she
_
adores
_
you
!
No
,
indeed
;
I
'm
sure
it
would
*NL*
never
do
to
say
anything
against
you
when
she
was
about
;
one
would
soon
*NL*
be
taught
one
's
place
!
Whatever
we
might
be
doing
,
if
we
were
looking
at
*NL*
a
picture
,
for
instance
,
she
would
say
,
`
If
only
we
had
him
here
,
he
's
*NL*
the
man
who
could
tell
us
whether
it
's
genuine
or
not
.
There
's
no
one
*NL*
like
him
for
that
.
'
And
all
day
long
she
would
be
saying
,
`
What
can
*NL*
he
be
doing
just
now
?
I
do
hope
,
he
's
doing
a
little
work
!
It
's
too
*NL*
dreadful
that
a
fellow
with
such
gifts
as
he
has
should
be
so
lazy
.
'
*NL*
-LRB-
Forgive
me
,
wo
n't
you
.
-RRB-
'
I
can
see
him
this
very
moment
;
he
's
thinking
*NL*
of
us
,
he
's
wondering
where
we
are
.
'
Indeed
,
she
used
an
expression
*NL*
which
I
thought
very
pretty
at
the
time
.
M.
Verdurin
asked
her
,
`
How
in
*NL*
the
world
can
you
see
what
he
's
doing
,
when
he
's
a
thousand
miles
away
?
'
*NL*
And
Odette
answered
,
`
Nothing
is
impossible
to
the
eye
of
a
friend
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
assure
you
,
I
'm
not
saying
it
just
to
flatter
you
;
you
have
a
*NL*
true
friend
in
her
,
such
as
one
does
n't
often
find
.
I
can
tell
you
,
*NL*
besides
,
in
case
you
do
n't
know
it
,
that
you
're
the
only
one
.
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
told
me
as
much
herself
on
our
last
day
with
them
-LRB-
one
talks
*NL*
more
freely
,
do
n't
you
know
,
before
a
parting
-RRB-
,
'
I
do
n't
say
that
Odette
*NL*
is
n't
fond
of
us
,
but
anything
that
we
may
say
to
her
counts
for
very
*NL*
little
beside
what
Swann
might
say
.
'
Oh
,
mercy
,
there
's
the
conductor
*NL*
stopping
for
me
;
here
have
I
been
chatting
away
to
you
,
and
would
have
*NL*
gone
right
past
the
Rue
Bonaparte
,
and
never
noticed
...
Will
you
be
so
*NL*
very
kind
as
to
tell
me
whether
my
plume
is
straight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mme.
Cottard
withdrew
from
her
muff
,
to
offer
it
to
Swann
,
a
*NL*
white-gloved
hand
from
which
there
floated
,
with
a
transier-ticket
,
an
*NL*
atmosphere
of
fashionable
life
that
pervaded
the
omnibus
,
blended
with
*NL*
the
harsher
fragrance
of
newly
cleaned
kid
.
And
Swann
felt
himself
*NL*
overflowing
with
gratitude
to
her
,
as
well
as
to
Mme.
Verdurin
-LRB-
and
*NL*
almost
to
Odette
,
for
the
feeling
that
he
now
entertained
for
her
was
*NL*
no
longer
tinged
with
pain
,
was
scarcely
even
to
be
described
,
now
,
*NL*
as
love
-RRB-
,
while
from
the
platform
of
the
omnibus
he
followed
her
with
*NL*
loving
eyes
,
as
she
gallantly
threaded
her
way
along
the
Rue
Bonaparte
,
*NL*
her
plume
erect
,
her
skirt
held
up
in
one
hand
,
while
in
the
other
she
*NL*
clasped
her
umbrella
and
her
card-case
,
so
that
its
monogram
could
be
*NL*
seen
,
her
muff
dancing
in
the
air
before
her
as
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
compete
with
and
so
to
stimulate
the
moribund
feelings
that
Swann
had
*NL*
for
Odette
,
Mme.
Cottard
,
a
wiser
physician
,
in
this
case
,
than
ever
*NL*
her
husband
would
have
been
,
had
grafted
among
them
others
more
normal
,
*NL*
feelings
of
gratitude
,
of
friendship
,
which
in
Swann
's
mind
were
to
make
*NL*
Odette
seem
again
more
human
-LRB-
more
like
other
women
,
since
other
women
*NL*
could
inspire
the
same
feelings
in
him
-RRB-
,
were
to
hasten
her
final
*NL*
transformation
back
into
that
Odette
,
loved
with
an
undisturbed
*NL*
affection
,
who
had
taken
him
home
one
evening
after
a
revel
at
the
*NL*
painter
's
,
to
drink
orangeade
with
Forcheville
,
that
Odette
with
whom
*NL*
Swann
had
calculated
that
he
might
live
in
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
former
times
,
having
often
thought
with
terror
that
a
day
must
come
*NL*
when
he
would
cease
to
be
in
love
with
Odette
,
he
had
determined
to
*NL*
keep
a
sharp
look-out
,
and
as
soon
as
he
felt
that
love
was
beginning
to
*NL*
escape
him
,
to
cling
tightly
to
it
and
to
hold
it
back
.
But
now
,
to
the
*NL*
faintness
of
his
love
there
corresponded
a
simultaneous
faintness
in
*NL*
his
desire
to
remain
her
lover
.
For
a
man
can
not
change
,
that
is
to
say
*NL*
become
another
person
,
while
he
continues
to
obey
the
dictates
of
the
*NL*
self
which
he
has
ceased
to
be
.
Occasionally
the
name
,
if
it
caught
*NL*
his
eye
in
a
newspaper
,
of
one
of
the
men
whom
he
supposed
to
have
been
*NL*
Odette
's
lovers
,
reawakened
his
jealousy
.
But
it
was
very
slight
,
and
,
*NL*
inasmuch
as
it
proved
to
him
that
he
had
not
completely
emerged
from
*NL*
that
period
in
which
he
had
so
keenly
suffered
--
though
in
it
he
had
also
*NL*
known
a
way
of
feeling
so
intensely
happy
--
and
that
the
accidents
of
his
*NL*
course
might
still
enable
him
to
catch
an
occasional
glimpse
,
stealthily
*NL*
and
at
a
distance
,
of
its
beauties
,
this
jealousy
gave
him
,
if
anything
,
*NL*
an
agreeable
thrill
,
as
to
the
sad
Parisian
,
when
he
has
left
Venice
*NL*
behind
him
and
must
return
to
France
,
a
last
mosquito
proves
that
*NL*
Italy
and
summer
are
still
not
too
remote
.
But
,
as
a
rule
,
with
this
*NL*
particular
period
of
his
life
from
which
he
was
emerging
,
when
he
made
*NL*
an
effort
,
if
not
to
remain
in
it
,
at
least
to
obtain
,
while
still
he
*NL*
might
,
an
uninterrupted
view
of
it
,
he
discovered
that
already
it
was
*NL*
too
late
;
he
would
have
looked
back
to
distinguish
,
as
it
might
be
*NL*
a
landscape
that
was
about
to
disappear
,
that
love
from
which
he
had
*NL*
departed
,
but
it
is
so
difficult
to
enter
into
a
state
of
complete
*NL*
duality
and
to
present
to
oneself
the
lifelike
spectacle
of
a
feeling
*NL*
which
one
has
ceased
to
possess
,
that
very
soon
,
the
clouds
gathering
*NL*
in
his
brain
,
he
could
see
nothing
,
he
would
abandon
the
attempt
,
would
*NL*
take
the
glasses
from
his
nose
and
wipe
them
;
and
he
told
himself
that
*NL*
he
would
do
better
to
rest
for
a
little
,
that
there
would
be
time
enough
*NL*
later
on
,
and
settled
back
into
his
corner
with
as
little
curiosity
,
*NL*
with
as
much
torpor
as
the
drowsy
traveller
who
pulls
his
cap
down
over
*NL*
his
eyes
so
as
to
get
some
sleep
in
the
railway-carriage
that
is
drawing
*NL*
him
,
he
feels
,
faster
and
faster
,
out
of
the
country
in
which
he
has
*NL*
lived
for
so
long
,
and
which
he
vowed
that
he
would
not
allow
to
slip
*NL*
away
from
him
without
looking
out
to
bid
it
a
last
farewell
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
like
the
same
traveller
,
if
he
does
not
awake
until
he
has
crossed
the
*NL*
frontier
and
is
again
in
France
,
when
Swann
happened
to
alight
,
close
*NL*
at
hand
,
upon
something
which
proved
that
Forcheville
had
been
Odette
's
*NL*
lover
,
he
discovered
that
it
caused
him
no
pain
,
that
love
was
now
*NL*
utterly
remote
,
and
he
regretted
that
he
had
had
no
warning
of
the
*NL*
moment
in
which
he
had
emerged
from
it
for
ever
.
And
just
as
,
before
*NL*
kissing
Odette
for
the
first
time
,
he
had
sought
to
imprint
upon
his
*NL*
memory
the
face
that
for
so
long
had
been
familiar
,
before
it
was
*NL*
altered
by
the
additional
memory
of
their
kiss
,
so
he
could
have
*NL*
wished
--
in
thought
at
least
--
to
have
been
in
a
position
to
bid
farewell
,
*NL*
while
she
still
existed
,
to
that
Odette
who
had
inspired
love
in
him
and
*NL*
jealousy
,
to
that
Odette
who
had
caused
him
so
to
suffer
,
and
whom
now
*NL*
he
would
never
see
again
.
He
was
mistaken
.
He
was
destined
to
see
*NL*
her
once
again
,
a
few
weeks
later
.
It
was
while
he
was
asleep
,
in
the
*NL*
twilight
of
a
dream
.
He
was
walking
with
Mme.
Verdurin
,
Dr.
Cottard
,
*NL*
a
young
man
in
a
fez
whom
he
failed
to
identify
,
the
painter
,
Odette
,
*NL*
Napoleon
III
and
my
grandfather
,
along
a
path
which
followed
the
line
*NL*
of
the
coast
,
and
overhung
the
sea
,
now
at
a
great
height
,
now
by
a
few
*NL*
feet
only
,
so
that
they
were
continually
going
up
and
down
;
those
of
the
*NL*
party
who
had
reached
the
downward
slope
were
no
longer
visible
to
those
*NL*
who
were
still
climbing
;
what
little
daylight
yet
remained
was
failing
,
*NL*
and
it
seemed
as
though
a
black
night
was
immediately
to
fall
on
them
.
*NL*
Now
and
then
the
waves
dashed
against
the
cliff
,
and
Swann
could
feel
on
*NL*
his
cheek
a
shower
of
freezing
spray
.
Odette
told
him
to
wipe
this
off
,
*NL*
but
he
could
not
,
and
felt
confused
and
helpless
in
her
company
,
as
well
*NL*
as
because
he
was
in
his
nightshirt
.
He
hoped
that
,
in
the
darkness
,
*NL*
this
might
pass
unnoticed
;
Mme.
Verdurin
,
however
,
fixed
her
astonished
*NL*
gaze
upon
him
for
an
endless
moment
,
in
which
he
saw
her
face
change
*NL*
its
shape
,
her
nose
grow
longer
,
while
beneath
it
there
sprouted
a
heavy
*NL*
moustache
.
He
turned
away
to
examine
Odette
;
her
cheeks
were
pale
,
with
*NL*
little
fiery
spots
,
her
features
drawn
and
ringed
with
shadows
;
but
she
*NL*
looked
back
at
him
with
eyes
welling
with
affection
,
ready
to
detach
*NL*
themselves
like
tears
and
to
fall
upon
his
face
,
and
he
felt
that
he
*NL*
loved
her
so
much
that
he
would
have
liked
to
carry
her
off
with
him
*NL*
at
once
.
Suddenly
Odette
turned
her
wrist
,
glanced
at
a
tiny
watch
,
*NL*
and
said
:
``
I
must
go
.
''
She
took
leave
of
everyone
,
in
the
same
formal
*NL*
manner
,
without
taking
Swann
aside
,
without
telling
him
where
they
were
*NL*
to
meet
that
evening
,
or
next
day
.
He
dared
not
ask
,
he
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
follow
her
,
he
was
obliged
,
without
turning
back
in
her
direction
,
*NL*
to
answer
with
a
smile
some
question
by
Mme.
Verdurin
;
but
his
heart
was
*NL*
frantically
beating
,
he
felt
that
he
now
hated
Odette
,
he
would
gladly
*NL*
have
crushed
those
eyes
which
,
a
moment
ago
,
he
had
loved
so
dearly
,
*NL*
have
torn
the
blood
into
those
lifeless
cheeks
.
He
continued
to
climb
*NL*
with
Mme.
Verdurin
,
that
is
to
say
that
each
step
took
him
farther
from
*NL*
Odette
,
who
was
going
downhill
,
and
in
the
other
direction
.
A
second
*NL*
passed
and
it
was
many
hours
since
she
had
left
him
.
The
painter
*NL*
remarked
to
Swann
that
Napoleon
III
had
eclipsed
himself
immediately
*NL*
after
Odette
.
``
They
had
obviously
arranged
it
between
them
,
''
he
added
;
*NL*
``
they
must
have
agreed
to
meet
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
,
but
they
*NL*
would
n't
say
good-bye
together
;
it
might
have
looked
odd
.
She
is
his
*NL*
mistress
.
''
The
strange
young
man
burst
into
tears
.
Swann
endeavoured
to
*NL*
console
him
.
``
After
all
,
she
is
quite
right
,
''
he
said
to
the
young
man
,
*NL*
drying
his
eyes
for
him
and
taking
off
the
fez
to
make
him
feel
more
*NL*
at
ease
.
``
I
've
advised
her
to
do
that
,
myself
,
a
dozen
times
.
Why
be
*NL*
so
distressed
?
He
was
obviously
the
man
to
understand
her
.
''
So
Swann
*NL*
reasoned
with
himself
,
for
the
young
man
whom
he
had
failed
,
at
*NL*
first
,
to
identify
,
was
himself
also
;
like
certain
novelists
,
he
had
*NL*
distributed
his
own
personality
between
two
characters
,
him
who
was
the
*NL*
`
first
person
'
in
the
dream
,
and
another
whom
he
saw
before
him
,
capped
*NL*
with
a
fez
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Napoleon
III
,
it
was
to
Forcheville
that
some
vague
association
*NL*
of
ideas
,
then
a
certain
modification
of
the
Baron
's
usual
physiognomy
,
*NL*
and
lastly
the
broad
ribbon
of
the
Legion
of
Honour
across
his
breast
,
*NL*
had
made
Swann
give
that
name
;
but
actually
,
and
in
everything
that
the
*NL*
person
who
appeared
in
his
dream
represented
and
recalled
to
him
,
it
was
*NL*
indeed
Forcheville
.
For
,
from
an
incomplete
and
changing
set
of
images
,
*NL*
Swann
in
his
sleep
drew
false
deductions
,
enjoying
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
such
creative
power
that
he
was
able
to
reproduce
himself
by
a
simple
*NL*
act
of
division
,
like
certain
lower
organisms
;
with
the
warmth
that
he
*NL*
felt
in
his
own
palm
he
modelled
the
hollow
of
a
strange
hand
which
he
*NL*
thought
that
he
was
clasping
,
and
out
of
feelings
and
impressions
of
*NL*
which
he
was
not
yet
conscious
,
he
brought
about
sudden
vicissitudes
*NL*
which
,
by
a
chain
of
logical
sequences
,
would
produce
,
at
definite
*NL*
points
in
his
dream
,
the
person
required
to
receive
his
love
or
to
*NL*
startle
him
awake
.
In
an
instant
night
grew
black
about
him
;
an
alarum
*NL*
rang
,
the
inhabitants
ran
past
him
,
escaping
from
their
blazing
houses
;
*NL*
he
could
hear
the
thunder
of
the
surging
waves
,
and
also
of
his
own
*NL*
heart
,
which
,
with
equal
violence
,
was
anxiously
beating
in
his
breast
.
*NL*
Suddenly
the
speed
of
these
palpitations
redoubled
,
he
felt
a
pain
,
a
*NL*
nausea
that
were
inexplicable
;
a
peasant
,
dreadfully
burned
,
flung
at
*NL*
him
as
he
passed
:
``
Come
and
ask
Charlus
where
Odette
spent
the
night
*NL*
with
her
friend
.
He
used
to
go
about
with
her
,
and
she
tells
him
*NL*
everything
.
It
was
they
that
started
the
fire
.
''
It
was
his
valet
,
come
*NL*
to
awaken
him
,
and
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
it
is
eight
o'clock
,
and
the
barber
is
here
.
I
have
told
him
to
*NL*
call
again
in
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
words
,
as
they
dived
down
through
the
waves
of
sleep
in
which
*NL*
Swann
was
submerged
,
did
not
reach
his
consciousness
without
undergoing
*NL*
that
refraction
which
turns
a
ray
of
light
,
at
the
bottom
of
a
bowl
of
*NL*
water
,
into
another
sun
;
just
as
,
a
moment
earlier
,
the
sound
of
*NL*
the
door-bell
,
swelling
in
the
depths
of
his
abyss
of
sleep
into
the
*NL*
clangour
of
an
alarum
,
had
engendered
the
episode
of
the
fire
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
the
scenery
of
his
dream-stage
scattered
in
dust
,
he
opened
his
eyes
,
*NL*
heard
for
the
last
time
the
boom
of
a
wave
in
the
sea
,
grown
very
*NL*
distant
.
He
touched
his
cheek
.
It
was
dry
.
And
yet
he
could
feel
the
*NL*
sting
of
the
cold
spray
,
and
the
taste
of
salt
on
his
lips
.
He
rose
,
*NL*
and
dressed
himself
.
He
had
made
the
barber
come
early
because
he
had
*NL*
written
,
the
day
before
,
to
my
grandfather
,
to
say
that
he
was
going
,
*NL*
that
afternoon
,
to
Combray
,
having
learned
that
Mme.
de
Cambremer
--
Mlle.
*NL*
Legrandin
that
had
been
--
was
spending
a
few
days
there
.
The
association
*NL*
in
his
memory
of
her
young
and
charming
face
with
a
place
in
the
country
*NL*
which
he
had
not
visited
for
so
long
,
offered
him
a
combined
attraction
*NL*
which
had
made
him
decide
at
last
to
leave
Paris
for
a
while
.
As
the
*NL*
different
changes
and
chances
that
bring
us
into
the
company
of
certain
*NL*
other
people
in
this
life
do
not
coincide
with
the
periods
in
which
we
*NL*
are
in
love
with
those
people
,
but
,
overlapping
them
,
may
occur
before
*NL*
love
has
begun
,
and
may
be
repeated
after
love
is
ended
,
the
earliest
*NL*
appearances
,
in
our
life
,
of
a
creature
who
is
destined
to
afford
us
*NL*
pleasure
later
on
,
assume
retrospectively
in
our
eyes
a
certain
value
as
*NL*
an
indication
,
a
warning
,
a
presage
.
It
was
in
this
fashion
that
Swann
*NL*
had
often
carried
back
his
mind
to
the
image
of
Odette
,
encountered
in
*NL*
the
theatre
,
on
that
first
evening
when
he
had
no
thought
of
ever
*NL*
seeing
her
again
--
and
that
he
now
recalled
the
party
at
Mme.
de
*NL*
Saint-Euverte
's
,
at
which
he
had
introduced
General
de
Frober-ville
to
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cambremer
.
So
manifold
are
our
interests
in
life
that
it
is
*NL*
not
uncommon
that
,
on
a
single
occasion
,
the
foundations
of
a
happiness
*NL*
which
does
not
yet
exist
are
laid
down
simultaneously
with
aggravations
*NL*
of
a
grief
from
which
we
are
still
suffering
.
And
,
no
doubt
,
that
might
*NL*
have
occurred
to
Swann
elsewhere
than
at
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
.
Who
,
*NL*
indeed
,
can
say
whether
,
in
the
event
of
his
having
gone
,
that
evening
,
*NL*
somewhere
else
,
other
happinesses
,
other
griefs
would
not
have
come
to
*NL*
him
,
which
,
later
,
would
have
appeared
to
have
been
inevitable
?
But
what
*NL*
did
seem
to
him
to
have
been
inevitable
was
what
had
indeed
taken
place
,
*NL*
and
he
was
not
far
short
of
seeing
something
providential
in
the
fact
*NL*
that
he
had
at
last
decided
to
go
to
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
that
*NL*
evening
,
because
his
mind
,
anxious
to
admire
the
richness
of
invention
*NL*
that
life
shews
,
and
incapable
of
facing
a
difficult
problem
for
any
*NL*
length
of
time
,
such
as
to
discover
what
,
actually
,
had
been
most
to
be
*NL*
wished
for
,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
sufferings
through
which
he
*NL*
had
passed
that
evening
,
and
the
pleasures
,
at
that
time
unsuspected
,
*NL*
which
were
already
being
brought
to
birth
,
--
the
exact
balance
between
*NL*
which
was
too
difficult
to
establish
--
were
linked
by
a
sort
of
*NL*
concatenation
of
necessity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
,
an
hour
after
his
awakening
,
he
was
giving
instructions
*NL*
to
the
barber
,
so
that
his
stiffly
brushed
hair
should
not
become
*NL*
disarranged
on
the
journey
,
he
thought
once
again
of
his
dream
;
he
*NL*
saw
once
again
,
as
he
had
felt
them
close
beside
him
,
Odette
's
pallid
*NL*
complexion
,
her
too
thin
cheeks
,
her
drawn
features
,
her
tired
eyes
,
all
*NL*
the
things
which
--
in
the
course
of
those
successive
bursts
of
affection
*NL*
which
had
made
of
his
enduring
love
for
Odette
a
long
oblivion
of
the
*NL*
first
impression
that
he
had
formed
of
her
--
he
had
ceased
to
observe
*NL*
after
the
first
few
days
of
their
intimacy
,
days
to
which
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
while
he
slept
,
his
memory
had
returned
to
seek
the
exact
sensation
of
*NL*
those
things
.
And
with
that
old
,
intermittent
fatuity
,
which
reappeared
*NL*
in
him
now
that
he
was
no
longer
unhappy
,
and
lowered
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
the
average
level
of
his
morality
,
he
cried
out
in
his
heart
:
``
To
think
*NL*
that
I
have
wasted
years
of
my
life
,
that
I
have
longed
for
death
,
that
*NL*
the
greatest
love
that
I
have
ever
known
has
been
for
a
woman
who
did
*NL*
not
please
me
,
who
was
not
in
my
style

PLACE-NAMES
:
THE
NAME
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
rooms
which
used
most
commonly
to
take
shape
in
my
mind
during
*NL*
my
long
nights
of
sleeplessness
,
there
was
none
that
differed
more
*NL*
utterly
from
the
rooms
at
Combray
,
thickly
powdered
with
the
motes
of
an
*NL*
atmosphere
granular
,
pollenous
,
edible
and
instinct
with
piety
,
than
*NL*
my
room
in
the
Grand
H√¥tel
de
la
Plage
,
at
Balbec
,
the
walls
of
which
,
*NL*
washed
with
ripolin
,
contained
,
like
the
polished
sides
of
a
basin
in
*NL*
which
the
water
glows
with
a
blue
,
lurking
fire
,
a
finer
air
,
pure
,
*NL*
azure-tinted
,
saline
.
The
Bavarian
upholsterer
who
had
been
entrusted
*NL*
with
the
furnishing
of
this
hotel
had
varied
his
scheme
of
decoration
*NL*
in
different
rooms
,
and
in
that
which
I
found
myself
occupying
had
set
*NL*
against
the
walls
,
on
three
sides
of
it
,
a
series
of
low
book-cases
*NL*
with
glass
fronts
,
in
which
,
according
to
where
they
stood
,
by
a
law
*NL*
of
nature
which
he
had
,
perhaps
,
forgotten
to
take
into
account
,
was
*NL*
reflected
this
or
that
section
of
the
ever-changing
view
of
the
sea
,
so
*NL*
that
the
walls
were
lined
with
a
frieze
of
seascapes
,
interrupted
only
*NL*
by
the
polished
mahogany
of
the
actual
shelves
.
And
so
effective
was
*NL*
this
that
the
whole
room
had
the
appearance
of
one
of
those
model
*NL*
bedrooms
which
you
see
nowadays
in
Housing
Exhibitions
,
decorated
with
*NL*
works
of
art
which
are
calculated
by
their
designer
to
refresh
the
eyes
*NL*
of
whoever
may
ultimately
have
to
sleep
in
the
rooms
,
the
subjects
being
*NL*
kept
in
some
degree
of
harmony
with
the
locality
and
surroundings
of
the
*NL*
houses
for
which
the
rooms
are
planned
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
nothing
could
have
differed
more
utterly
,
either
,
from
the
real
*NL*
Balbec
than
that
other
Balbec
of
which
I
had
often
dreamed
,
on
stormy
*NL*
days
,
when
the
wind
was
so
strong
that
Fran√ßoise
,
as
she
took
me
to
*NL*
the
Champs-Elys√©es
,
would
warn
me
not
to
walk
too
near
the
side
of
the
*NL*
street
,
or
I
might
have
my
head
knocked
off
by
a
falling
slate
,
and
*NL*
would
recount
to
me
,
with
many
lamentations
,
the
terrible
disasters
and
*NL*
shipwrecks
that
were
reported
in
the
newspaper
.
I
longed
for
nothing
*NL*
more
than
to
behold
a
storm
at
sea
,
less
as
a
mighty
spectacle
than
as
*NL*
a
momentary
revelation
of
the
true
life
of
nature
;
or
rather
there
*NL*
were
for
me
no
mighty
spectacles
save
those
which
I
knew
to
be
*NL*
not
artificially
composed
for
my
entertainment
,
but
necessary
and
*NL*
unalterable
,
--
the
beauty
of
landscapes
or
of
great
works
of
art
.
I
was
*NL*
not
curious
,
I
did
not
thirst
to
know
anything
save
what
I
believed
*NL*
to
be
more
genuine
than
myself
,
what
had
for
me
the
supreme
merit
of
*NL*
shewing
me
a
fragment
of
the
mind
of
a
great
genius
,
or
of
the
force
*NL*
or
the
grace
of
nature
as
she
appeared
when
left
entirely
to
herself
,
*NL*
without
human
interference
.
Just
as
the
lovely
sound
of
her
voice
,
*NL*
reproduced
,
all
by
itself
,
upon
the
phonograph
,
could
never
console
a
*NL*
man
for
the
loss
of
his
mother
,
so
a
mechanical
imitation
of
a
storm
*NL*
would
have
left
me
as
cold
as
did
the
illuminated
fountains
at
the
*NL*
Exhibition
.
I
required
also
,
if
the
storm
was
to
be
absolutely
genuine
,
*NL*
that
the
shore
from
which
I
watched
it
should
be
a
natural
shore
,
not
an
*NL*
embankment
recently
constructed
by
a
municipality
.
Besides
,
nature
,
by
*NL*
all
the
feelings
that
she
aroused
in
me
,
seemed
to
me
the
most
opposite
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
to
the
mechanical
inventions
of
mankind
The
less
she
*NL*
bore
their
imprint
,
the
more
room
she
offered
for
the
expansion
of
my
*NL*
heart
.
And
,
as
it
happened
,
I
had
preserved
the
name
of
Balbec
,
which
*NL*
Legrandin
had
cited
to
us
,
as
that
of
a
sea-side
place
in
the
very
midst
*NL*
of
``
that
funereal
coast
,
famed
for
the
number
of
its
wrecks
,
swathed
,
*NL*
for
six
months
in
the
year
,
in
a
shroud
of
fog
and
flying
foam
from
the
*NL*
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
feel
,
there
,
below
your
feet
still
,
''
he
had
told
me
,
``
far
more
even
*NL*
than
at
Finist√®re
-LRB-
and
even
though
hotels
are
now
being
superimposed
*NL*
upon
it
,
without
power
,
however
,
to
modify
that
oldest
bone
in
the
*NL*
earth
's
skeleton
-RRB-
you
feel
there
that
you
are
actually
at
the
land
's
*NL*
end
of
France
,
of
Europe
,
of
the
Old
World
.
And
it
is
the
ultimate
*NL*
encampment
of
the
fishermen
,
precisely
like
the
fishermen
who
have
*NL*
lived
since
the
world
's
beginning
,
facing
the
everlasting
kingdom
of
*NL*
the
sea-fogs
and
shadows
of
the
night
.
''
One
day
when
,
at
Combray
,
I
had
*NL*
spoken
of
this
coast
,
this
Balbec
,
before
M.
Swann
,
hoping
to
learn
from
*NL*
him
whether
it
was
the
best
point
to
select
for
seeing
the
most
violent
*NL*
storms
,
he
had
replied
:
``
I
should
think
I
did
know
Balbec
!
The
church
*NL*
at
Balbec
,
built
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
,
and
still
*NL*
half
romanesque
,
is
perhaps
the
most
curious
example
to
be
found
of
our
*NL*
Norman
gothic
,
and
so
exceptional
that
one
is
tempted
to
describe
it
*NL*
as
Persian
in
its
inspiration
.
''
And
that
region
,
which
,
until
then
,
had
*NL*
seemed
to
me
to
be
nothing
else
than
a
part
of
immemorial
nature
,
that
*NL*
had
remained
contemporaneous
with
the
great
phenomena
of
geology
--
and
as
*NL*
remote
from
human
history
as
the
Ocean
itself
,
or
the
Great
Bear
,
with
*NL*
its
wild
race
of
fishermen
for
whom
,
no
more
than
for
their
whales
,
*NL*
had
there
been
any
Middle
Ages
--
it
had
been
a
great
joy
to
me
to
see
*NL*
it
suddenly
take
its
place
in
the
order
of
the
centuries
,
with
a
stored
*NL*
consciousness
of
the
romanesque
epoch
,
and
to
know
that
the
gothic
*NL*
trefoil
had
come
to
diversify
those
wild
rocks
also
,
at
the
appointed
*NL*
hour
,
like
those
frail
but
hardy
plants
which
,
in
the
Polar
regions
,
*NL*
when
the
spring
returns
,
scatter
their
stars
about
the
eternal
snows
.
*NL*
And
if
gothic
art
brought
to
those
places
and
people
a
classification
*NL*
which
,
otherwise
,
they
lacked
,
they
too
conferred
one
upon
it
in
return
.
*NL*
I
tried
to
form
a
picture
in
my
mind
of
how
those
fishermen
had
lived
,
*NL*
the
timid
and
unsuspected
essay
towards
social
intercourse
which
they
*NL*
had
attempted
there
,
clustered
upon
a
promontory
of
the
shores
of
Hell
,
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
of
death
;
and
gothic
art
seemed
to
me
a
more
*NL*
living
thing
now
that
,
detaching
it
from
the
towns
in
which
,
until
then
,
*NL*
I
had
always
imagined
it
,
I
could
see
how
,
in
a
particular
instance
,
*NL*
upon
a
reef
of
savage
rocks
,
it
had
taken
root
and
grown
until
it
*NL*
flowered
in
a
tapering
spire
.
I
was
taken
to
see
reproductions
of
the
*NL*
most
famous
of
the
statues
at
Balbec
,
--
shaggy
,
blunt-faced
Apostles
,
*NL*
the
Virgin
from
the
porch
,
--
and
I
could
scarcely
breathe
for
joy
at
the
*NL*
thought
that
I
might
myself
,
one
day
,
see
them
take
a
solid
form
against
*NL*
their
eternal
background
of
salt
fog
.
Thereafter
,
on
dear
,
tempestuous
*NL*
February
nights
,
the
wind
--
breathing
into
my
heart
,
which
it
shook
no
*NL*
less
violently
than
the
chimney
of
my
bedroom
,
the
project
of
a
visit
to
*NL*
Balbec
--
blended
in
me
the
desire
for
gothic
architecture
with
that
for
a
*NL*
storm
upon
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
liked
to
take
,
the
very
next
day
,
the
good
,
the
generous
*NL*
train
at
one
twenty-two
,
of
which
never
without
a
palpitating
heart
*NL*
could
I
read
,
in
the
railway
company
's
bills
or
in
advertisements
of
*NL*
circular
tours
,
the
hour
of
departure
:
it
seemed
to
me
to
cut
,
at
*NL*
a
precise
point
in
every
afternoon
,
a
most
fascinating
groove
,
a
*NL*
mysterious
mark
,
from
which
the
diverted
hours
still
led
one
on
,
of
*NL*
course
,
towards
evening
,
towards
to-morrow
morning
,
but
to
an
evening
*NL*
and
morning
which
one
would
behold
,
not
in
Paris
but
in
one
of
those
*NL*
towns
through
which
the
train
passed
and
among
which
it
allowed
one
*NL*
to
choose
;
for
it
stopped
at
Bayeux
,
at
Coutances
,
at
Vitr√©
,
at
*NL*
Questambert
,
at
Pontorson
,
at
Balbec
,
at
Lannion
,
at
Lamballe
,
at
*NL*
Benodet
,
at
Pont-Aven
,
at
Quimperle
,
and
progressed
magnificently
*NL*
surcharged
with
names
which
it
offered
me
,
so
that
,
among
them
all
,
I
*NL*
did
not
know
which
to
choose
,
so
impossible
was
it
to
sacrifice
any
.
*NL*
But
even
without
waiting
for
the
train
next
day
,
I
could
,
by
rising
and
*NL*
dressing
myself
with
all
speed
,
leave
Paris
that
very
evening
,
should
*NL*
my
parents
permit
,
and
arrive
at
Balbec
as
dawn
spread
westward
over
the
*NL*
raging
sea
,
from
whose
driven
foam
I
would
seek
shelter
in
that
church
*NL*
in
the
Persian
manner
.
But
at
the
approach
of
the
Easter
holidays
,
when
*NL*
my
parents
had
promised
to
let
me
spend
them
,
for
once
,
in
the
North
*NL*
of
Italy
,
lo
!
in
place
of
those
dreams
of
tempests
,
by
which
I
had
been
*NL*
entirely
possessed
,
not
wishing
to
see
anything
but
waves
dashing
in
*NL*
from
all
sides
,
mounting
always
higher
,
upon
the
wildest
of
coasts
,
*NL*
beside
churches
as
rugged
and
precipitous
as
cliffs
,
in
whose
towers
*NL*
the
sea-birds
would
be
wailing
;
suddenly
,
effacing
them
,
taking
away
*NL*
all
their
charm
,
excluding
them
because
they
were
its
opposite
and
could
*NL*
only
have
weakened
its
effect
,
was
substituted
in
me
the
converse
dream
*NL*
of
the
most
variegated
of
springs
,
not
the
spring
of
Combray
,
still
*NL*
pricking
with
all
the
needle-points
of
the
winter
's
frost
,
but
that
*NL*
which
already
covered
with
lilies
and
anemones
the
meadows
of
Fiesole
,
*NL*
and
gave
Florence
a
dazzling
golden
background
,
like
those
in
Fra
*NL*
Angelico
's
pictures
.
From
that
moment
,
only
sunlight
,
perfumes
,
colours
,
*NL*
seemed
to
me
to
have
any
value
;
for
this
alternation
of
images
had
*NL*
effected
a
change
of
front
in
my
desire
,
and
--
as
abrupt
as
those
that
*NL*
occur
sometimes
in
music
,
--
a
complete
change
of
tone
in
my
sensibility
.
*NL*
Thus
it
came
about
that
a
mere
atmospheric
variation
would
be
sufficient
*NL*
to
provoke
in
me
that
modulation
,
without
there
being
any
need
for
me
to
*NL*
await
the
return
of
a
season
.
For
often
we
find
a
day
,
in
one
,
that
has
*NL*
strayed
from
another
season
,
and
makes
us
live
in
that
other
,
summons
at
*NL*
once
into
our
presence
and
makes
us
long
for
its
peculiar
pleasures
,
and
*NL*
interrupts
the
dreams
that
we
were
in
process
of
weaving
,
by
inserting
,
*NL*
out
of
its
turn
,
too
early
or
too
late
,
this
leaf
,
torn
from
another
*NL*
chapter
,
in
the
interpolated
calendar
of
Happiness
.
But
soon
it
happened
*NL*
that
,
like
those
natural
phenomena
from
which
our
comfort
or
our
health
*NL*
can
derive
but
an
accidental
and
all
too
modest
benefit
,
until
the
day
*NL*
when
science
takes
control
of
them
,
and
,
producing
them
at
will
,
places
*NL*
in
our
hands
the
power
to
order
their
appearance
,
withdrawn
from
*NL*
the
tutelage
and
independent
of
the
consent
of
chance
;
similarly
the
*NL*
production
of
these
dreams
of
the
Atlantic
and
of
Italy
ceased
to
depend
*NL*
entirely
upon
the
changes
of
the
seasons
and
of
the
weather
.
I
need
*NL*
only
,
to
make
them
reappear
,
pronounce
the
names
:
Balbec
,
Venice
,
*NL*
Florence
,
within
whose
syllables
had
gradually
accumulated
all
the
*NL*
longing
inspired
in
me
by
the
places
for
which
they
stood
.
Even
in
*NL*
spring
,
to
come
in
a
book
upon
the
name
of
Balbec
sufficed
to
awaken
*NL*
in
me
the
desire
for
storms
at
sea
and
for
the
Norman
gothic
;
even
on
a
*NL*
stormy
day
the
name
of
Florence
or
of
Venice
would
awaken
the
desire
for
*NL*
sunshine
,
for
lilies
,
for
the
Palace
of
the
Doges
and
for
Santa
Maria
*NL*
del
Fiore
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
their
names
thus
permanently
absorbed
the
image
that
I
had
formed
*NL*
of
these
towns
,
it
was
only
by
transforming
that
image
,
by
subordinating
*NL*
its
reappearance
in
me
to
their
own
special
laws
;
and
in
consequence
of
*NL*
this
they
made
it
more
beautiful
,
but
at
the
same
time
more
different
*NL*
from
anything
that
the
towns
of
Normandy
or
Tuscany
could
in
reality
be
,
*NL*
and
,
by
increasing
the
arbitrary
delights
of
my
imagination
,
aggravated
*NL*
the
disenchantment
that
was
in
store
for
me
when
I
set
out
upon
my
*NL*
travels
.
They
magnified
the
idea
that
I
formed
of
certain
points
on
the
*NL*
earth
's
surface
,
making
them
more
special
,
and
in
consequence
more
*NL*
real
.
I
did
not
then
represent
to
myself
towns
,
landscapes
,
historic
*NL*
buildings
,
as
pictures
more
or
less
attractive
,
cut
out
here
and
there
*NL*
of
a
substance
that
was
common
to
them
all
,
but
looked
on
each
of
them
*NL*
as
on
an
unknown
thing
,
different
from
all
the
rest
,
a
thing
for
which
*NL*
my
soul
was
athirst
,
by
the
knowledge
of
which
it
would
benefit
.
How
*NL*
much
more
individual
still
was
the
character
that
they
assumed
from
*NL*
being
designated
by
names
,
names
that
were
only
for
themselves
,
proper
*NL*
names
such
as
people
have
.
Words
present
to
us
little
pictures
of
*NL*
things
,
lucid
and
normal
,
like
the
pictures
that
are
hung
on
the
walls
*NL*
of
schoolrooms
to
give
children
an
illustration
of
what
is
meant
by
*NL*
a
carpenter
's
bench
,
a
bird
,
an
ant-hill
;
things
chosen
as
typical
of
*NL*
everything
else
of
the
same
sort
.
But
names
present
to
us
--
of
persons
*NL*
and
of
towns
which
they
accustom
us
to
regard
as
individual
,
as
unique
,
*NL*
like
persons
--
a
confused
picture
,
which
draws
from
the
names
,
from
*NL*
the
brightness
or
darkness
of
their
sound
,
the
colour
in
which
it
is
*NL*
uniformly
painted
,
like
one
of
those
posters
,
entirely
blue
or
entirely
*NL*
red
,
in
which
,
on
account
of
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
process
used
*NL*
in
their
reproduction
,
or
by
a
whim
on
the
designer
's
part
,
are
blue
or
*NL*
red
not
only
the
sky
and
the
sea
,
but
the
ships
and
the
church
and
the
*NL*
people
in
the
streets
.
The
name
of
Parma
,
one
of
the
towns
that
I
most
*NL*
longed
to
visit
,
after
reading
the
_
Chartreuse
_
,
seeming
to
me
compact
*NL*
and
glossy
,
violet-tinted
,
soft
,
if
anyone
were
to
speak
of
such
or
*NL*
such
a
house
in
Parma
,
in
which
I
should
be
lodged
,
he
would
give
me
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
thinking
that
I
was
to
inhabit
a
dwelling
that
was
compact
*NL*
and
glossy
,
violet-tinted
,
soft
,
and
that
bore
no
relation
to
the
houses
*NL*
in
any
other
town
in
Italy
,
since
I
could
imagine
it
only
by
the
aid
*NL*
of
that
heavy
syllable
of
the
name
of
Parma
,
in
which
no
breath
of
air
*NL*
stirred
,
and
of
all
that
I
had
made
it
assume
of
Stendhalian
sweetness
*NL*
and
the
reflected
hue
of
violets
.
And
when
I
thought
of
Florence
,
it
was
*NL*
of
a
town
miraculously
embalmed
,
and
flower-like
,
since
it
was
called
*NL*
the
City
of
the
Lilies
,
and
its
Cathedral
,
Our
Lady
of
the
Flower
.
As
*NL*
for
Balbec
,
it
was
one
of
those
names
in
which
,
as
on
an
old
piece
of
*NL*
Norman
pottery
that
still
keeps
the
colour
of
the
earth
from
which
*NL*
it
was
fashioned
,
one
sees
depicted
still
the
representation
of
some
*NL*
long-abolished
custom
,
of
some
feudal
right
,
of
the
former
condition
of
*NL*
some
place
,
of
an
obsolete
way
of
pronouncing
the
language
,
which
had
*NL*
shaped
and
wedded
its
incongruous
syllables
and
which
I
never
doubted
*NL*
that
I
should
find
spoken
there
at
once
,
even
by
the
inn-keeper
who
*NL*
would
pour
me
out
coffee
and
milk
on
my
arrival
,
taking
me
down
to
watch
*NL*
the
turbulent
sea
,
unchained
,
before
the
church
;
to
whom
I
lent
the
*NL*
aspect
,
disputatious
,
solemn
and
mediaeval
,
of
some
character
in
one
of
*NL*
the
old
romances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
my
health
definitely
improved
,
had
my
parents
allowed
me
,
if
not
*NL*
actually
to
go
down
to
stay
at
Balbec
,
at
least
to
take
,
just
once
,
so
*NL*
as
to
become
acquainted
with
the
architecture
and
landscapes
of
Normandy
*NL*
or
of
Brittany
,
that
one
twenty-two
train
into
which
I
had
so
often
*NL*
clambered
in
imagination
,
I
should
have
preferred
to
stop
,
and
to
alight
*NL*
from
it
,
at
the
most
beautiful
of
its
towns
;
but
in
vain
might
I
*NL*
compare
and
contrast
them
;
how
was
one
to
choose
,
any
more
than
between
*NL*
individual
people
,
who
are
not
interchangeable
,
between
Bayeux
,
so
lofty
*NL*
in
its
noble
coronet
of
rusty
lace
,
whose
highest
point
caught
the
light
*NL*
of
the
old
gold
of
its
second
syllable
;
Vitr√©
,
whose
acute
accent
barred
*NL*
its
ancient
glass
with
wooden
lozenges
;
gentle
Lamballe
,
whose
whiteness
*NL*
ranged
from
egg-shell
yellow
to
a
pearly
grey
;
Coutances
,
a
Norman
*NL*
Cathedral
,
which
its
final
consonants
,
rich
and
yellowing
,
crowned
with
*NL*
a
tower
of
butter
;
Lannion
with
the
rumble
and
buzz
,
in
the
silence
of
*NL*
its
village
street
,
of
the
fly
on
the
wheel
of
the
coach
;
Questambert
,
*NL*
Pontorson
,
ridiculously
silly
and
simple
,
white
feathers
and
yellow
*NL*
beaks
strewn
along
the
road
to
those
well-watered
and
poetic
spots
;
*NL*
Benodet
,
a
name
scarcely
moored
that
seemed
to
be
striving
to
draw
the
*NL*
river
down
into
the
tangle
of
its
seaweeds
;
Pont-Aven
,
the
snowy
,
rosy
*NL*
flight
of
the
wing
of
a
lightly
poised
coif
,
tremulously
reflected
in
*NL*
the
greenish
waters
of
a
canal
;
Quimperl√©
,
more
firmly
attached
,
this
,
*NL*
and
since
the
Middle
Ages
,
among
the
rivulets
with
which
it
babbled
,
*NL*
threading
their
pearls
upon
a
grey
background
,
like
the
pattern
made
,
*NL*
through
the
cobwebs
upon
a
window
,
by
rays
of
sunlight
changed
into
*NL*
blunt
points
of
tarnished
silver
?
*NL*
*NL*
These
images
were
false
for
another
reason
also
;
namely
,
that
they
*NL*
were
necessarily
much
simplified
;
doubtless
the
object
to
which
my
*NL*
imagination
aspired
,
which
my
senses
took
in
but
incompletely
and
*NL*
without
any
immediate
pleasure
,
I
had
committed
to
the
safe
custody
*NL*
of
names
;
doubtless
because
I
had
accumulated
there
a
store
of
dreams
,
*NL*
those
names
now
magnetised
my
desires
;
but
names
themselves
are
not
very
*NL*
comprehensive
;
the
most
that
I
could
do
was
to
include
in
each
of
them
*NL*
two
or
three
of
the
principal
curiosities
of
the
town
,
which
would
*NL*
lie
there
side
by
side
,
without
interval
or
partition
;
in
the
name
of
*NL*
Balbec
,
as
in
the
magnifying
glasses
set
in
those
penholders
which
*NL*
one
buys
at
sea-side
places
,
I
could
distinguish
waves
surging
round
*NL*
a
church
built
in
the
Persian
manner
.
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
the
enforced
*NL*
simplicity
of
these
images
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
hold
that
they
*NL*
had
over
me
.
When
my
father
had
decided
,
one
year
,
that
we
should
go
*NL*
for
the
Easter
holidays
to
Florence
and
Venice
,
not
finding
room
*NL*
to
introduce
into
the
name
of
Florence
the
elements
that
ordinarily
*NL*
constitute
a
town
,
I
was
obliged
to
let
a
supernatural
city
emerge
from
*NL*
the
impregnation
by
certain
vernal
scenes
of
what
I
supposed
to
be
,
*NL*
in
its
essentials
,
the
genius
of
Giotto
.
All
the
more
--
and
because
one
*NL*
can
not
make
a
name
extend
much
further
in
time
than
in
space
--
like
some
*NL*
of
Giotto
's
paintings
themselves
which
shew
us
at
two
separate
moments
*NL*
the
same
person
engaged
in
different
actions
,
here
lying
on
his
bed
,
*NL*
there
just
about
to
mount
his
horse
,
the
name
of
Florence
was
divided
*NL*
into
two
compartments
.
In
one
,
beneath
an
architectural
dais
,
I
gazed
*NL*
upon
a
fresco
over
which
was
partly
drawn
a
curtain
of
morning
sunlight
,
*NL*
dusty
,
aslant
,
and
gradually
spreading
;
in
the
other
-LRB-
for
,
since
*NL*
I
thought
of
names
not
as
an
inaccessible
ideal
but
as
a
real
and
*NL*
enveloping
substance
into
which
I
was
about
to
plunge
,
the
life
not
yet
*NL*
lived
,
the
life
intact
and
pure
which
I
enclosed
in
them
,
gave
to
the
*NL*
most
material
pleasures
,
to
the
simplest
scenes
,
the
same
attraction
*NL*
that
they
have
in
the
works
of
the
Primitives
-RRB-
,
I
moved
swiftly
--
so
as
*NL*
to
arrive
,
as
soon
as
might
be
,
at
the
table
that
was
spread
for
me
,
*NL*
with
fruit
and
a
flask
of
Chianti
--
across
a
Ponte
Vecchio
heaped
with
*NL*
jonquils
,
narcissi
and
anemones
.
That
-LRB-
for
all
that
I
was
still
in
*NL*
Paris
-RRB-
was
what
I
saw
,
and
not
what
was
actually
round
about
me
.
Even
*NL*
from
the
simplest
,
the
most
realistic
point
of
view
,
the
countries
for
*NL*
which
we
long
occupy
,
at
any
given
moment
,
a
far
larger
place
in
our
*NL*
true
life
than
the
country
in
which
we
may
happen
to
be
.
Doubtless
,
if
,
*NL*
at
that
time
,
I
had
paid
more
attention
to
what
was
in
my
mind
when
I
*NL*
pronounced
the
words
``
going
to
Florence
,
to
Parma
,
to
Pisa
,
to
Venice
,
''
*NL*
I
should
have
realised
that
what
I
saw
was
in
no
sense
a
town
,
but
*NL*
something
as
different
from
anything
that
I
knew
,
something
as
delicious
*NL*
as
might
be
for
a
human
race
whose
whole
existence
had
passed
in
a
*NL*
series
of
late
winter
afternoons
,
that
inconceivable
marvel
,
a
morning
*NL*
in
spring
.
These
images
,
unreal
,
fixed
,
always
alike
,
filling
all
my
*NL*
nights
and
days
,
differentiated
this
period
in
my
life
from
those
which
*NL*
had
gone
before
it
-LRB-
and
might
easily
have
been
confused
with
it
by
*NL*
an
observer
who
saw
things
only
from
without
,
that
is
to
say
,
who
saw
*NL*
nothing
-RRB-
,
as
in
an
opera
a
fresh
melody
introduces
a
novel
atmosphere
*NL*
which
one
could
never
have
suspected
if
one
had
done
no
more
than
*NL*
read
the
libretto
,
still
less
if
one
had
remained
outside
the
theatre
,
*NL*
counting
only
the
minutes
as
they
passed
.
And
besides
,
even
from
the
*NL*
point
of
view
of
mere
quantity
,
in
our
life
the
days
are
not
all
equal
.
*NL*
To
reach
the
end
of
a
day
,
natures
that
are
slightly
nervous
,
as
*NL*
mine
was
,
make
use
,
like
motor-cars
,
of
different
`
speeds
.
'
There
are
*NL*
mountainous
,
uncomfortable
days
,
up
which
one
takes
an
infinite
time
to
*NL*
pass
,
and
days
downward
sloping
,
through
which
one
can
go
at
full
tilt
,
*NL*
singing
as
one
goes
.
During
this
month
--
in
which
I
went
laboriously
*NL*
over
,
as
over
a
tune
,
though
never
to
my
satisfaction
,
these
visions
of
*NL*
Florence
,
Venice
,
Pisa
,
from
which
the
desire
that
they
excited
in
me
*NL*
drew
and
kept
something
as
profoundly
personal
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
love
,
love
for
another
person
--
I
never
ceased
to
believe
that
they
*NL*
corresponded
to
a
reality
independent
of
myself
,
and
they
made
me
*NL*
conscious
of
as
glorious
a
hope
as
could
have
been
cherished
by
a
*NL*
Christian
in
the
primitive
age
of
faith
,
on
the
eve
of
his
entry
into
*NL*
Paradise
.
Moreover
,
without
my
paying
any
heed
to
the
contradiction
that
*NL*
there
was
in
my
wishing
to
look
at
and
to
touch
with
my
organs
of
sense
*NL*
what
had
been
elaborated
by
the
spell
of
my
dreams
and
not
perceived
by
*NL*
my
senses
at
all
--
though
all
the
more
tempting
to
them
,
in
consequence
,
*NL*
more
different
from
anything
that
they
knew
--
it
was
that
which
recalled
*NL*
to
me
the
reality
of
these
visions
,
which
inflamed
my
desire
all
the
*NL*
more
by
seeming
to
hint
a
promise
that
my
desire
should
be
satisfied
.
*NL*
And
for
all
that
the
motive
force
of
my
exaltation
was
a
longing
for
*NL*
aesthetic
enjoyments
,
the
guide-books
ministered
even
more
to
it
than
*NL*
books
on
aesthetics
,
and
,
more
again
than
the
guide-books
,
the
railway
*NL*
time-tables
.
What
moved
me
was
the
thought
that
this
Florence
which
I
*NL*
could
see
,
so
near
and
yet
inaccessible
,
in
my
imagination
,
if
the
tract
*NL*
which
separated
it
from
me
,
in
myself
,
was
not
one
that
I
might
cross
,
*NL*
could
yet
be
reached
by
a
circuit
,
by
a
digression
,
were
I
to
take
*NL*
the
plain
,
terrestrial
path
.
When
I
repeated
to
myself
,
giving
thus
a
*NL*
special
value
to
what
I
was
going
to
see
,
that
Venice
was
the
``
School
of
*NL*
Giorgione
,
the
home
of
Titian
,
the
most
complete
museum
of
the
domestic
*NL*
architecture
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
''
I
felt
happy
indeed
.
As
I
was
even
*NL*
more
when
,
on
one
of
my
walks
,
as
I
stepped
out
briskly
on
account
*NL*
of
the
weather
,
which
,
after
several
days
of
a
precocious
spring
,
had
*NL*
relapsed
into
winter
-LRB-
like
the
weather
that
we
had
invariably
found
*NL*
awaiting
us
at
Combray
,
in
Holy
Week
-RRB-
,
--
seeing
upon
the
boulevards
that
*NL*
the
chestnut-trees
,
though
plunged
in
a
glacial
atmosphere
that
soaked
*NL*
through
them
like
a
stream
of
water
,
were
none
the
less
beginning
,
*NL*
punctual
guests
,
arrayed
already
for
the
party
,
and
admitting
no
*NL*
discouragement
,
to
shape
and
chisel
and
curve
in
its
frozen
lumps
the
*NL*
irrepressible
verdure
whose
steady
growth
the
abortive
power
of
the
*NL*
cold
might
hinder
but
could
not
succeed
in
restraining
--
I
reflected
that
*NL*
already
the
Ponte
Vecchio
was
heaped
high
with
an
abundance
of
hyacinths
*NL*
and
anemones
,
and
that
the
spring
sunshine
was
already
tinging
the
waves
*NL*
of
the
Grand
Canal
with
so
dusky
an
azure
,
with
emeralds
so
splendid
*NL*
that
when
they
washed
and
were
broken
against
the
foot
of
one
of
*NL*
Titian
's
paintings
they
could
vie
with
it
in
the
richness
of
their
*NL*
colouring
.
I
could
no
longer
contain
my
joy
when
my
father
,
in
the
*NL*
intervals
of
tapping
the
barometer
and
complaining
of
the
cold
,
began
*NL*
to
look
out
which
were
the
best
trains
,
and
when
I
understood
that
by
*NL*
making
one
's
way
,
after
luncheon
,
into
the
coal-grimed
laboratory
,
the
*NL*
wizard
's
cell
that
undertook
to
contrive
a
complete
transmutation
of
its
*NL*
surroundings
,
one
could
awaken
,
next
morning
,
in
the
city
of
marble
*NL*
and
gold
,
in
which
``
the
building
of
the
wall
was
of
jasper
and
the
*NL*
foundation
of
the
wall
an
emerald
.
''
So
that
it
and
the
City
of
the
*NL*
Lilies
were
not
just
artificial
scenes
which
I
could
set
up
at
my
*NL*
pleasure
in
front
of
my
imagination
,
but
did
actually
exist
at
a
certain
*NL*
distance
from
Paris
which
must
inevitably
be
traversed
if
I
wished
to
*NL*
see
them
,
at
their
appointed
place
on
the
earth
's
surface
,
and
at
no
*NL*
other
;
in
a
word
they
were
entirely
real
.
They
became
even
more
real
*NL*
to
me
when
my
father
,
by
saying
:
``
Well
,
you
can
stay
in
Venice
from
the
*NL*
20th
to
the
29th
,
and
reach
Florence
on
Easter
morning
,
''
made
them
both
*NL*
emerge
,
no
longer
only
from
the
abstraction
of
Space
,
but
from
that
*NL*
imaginary
Time
in
which
we
place
not
one
,
merely
,
but
several
of
*NL*
our
travels
at
once
,
which
do
not
greatly
tax
us
since
they
are
but
*NL*
possibilities
,
--
that
Time
which
reconstructs
itself
so
effectively
that
*NL*
one
can
spend
it
again
in
one
town
after
one
has
already
spent
it
in
*NL*
another
--
and
consecrated
to
them
some
of
those
actual
,
calendar
days
*NL*
which
are
certificates
of
the
genuineness
of
what
one
does
on
them
,
for
*NL*
those
unique
days
are
consumed
by
being
used
,
they
do
not
return
,
one
*NL*
can
not
live
them
again
here
when
one
has
lived
them
elsewhere
;
I
felt
*NL*
that
it
was
towards
the
week
that
would
begin
with
the
Monday
on
which
*NL*
the
laundress
was
to
bring
back
the
white
waistcoat
that
I
had
stained
*NL*
with
ink
,
that
they
were
hastening
to
busy
themselves
with
the
duty
*NL*
of
emerging
from
that
ideal
Time
in
which
they
did
not
,
as
yet
,
exist
,
*NL*
those
two
Queen
Cities
of
which
I
was
soon
to
be
able
,
by
the
most
*NL*
absorbing
kind
of
geometry
,
to
inscribe
the
domes
and
towers
on
a
*NL*
page
of
my
own
life
.
But
I
was
still
on
the
way
,
only
,
to
the
supreme
*NL*
pinnacle
of
happiness
;
I
reached
it
finally
-LRB-
for
not
until
then
did
the
*NL*
revelation
burst
upon
me
that
on
the
clattering
streets
,
reddened
by
the
*NL*
light
reflected
from
Giorgione
's
frescoes
,
it
was
not
,
as
I
had
,
despite
*NL*
so
many
promptings
,
continued
to
imagine
,
the
men
``
majestic
and
terrible
*NL*
as
the
sea
,
bearing
armour
that
gleamed
with
bronze
beneath
the
folds
*NL*
of
their
blood-red
cloaks
,
''
who
would
be
walking
in
Venice
next
week
,
on
*NL*
the
Easter
vigil
;
but
that
I
myself
might
be
the
minute
personage
whom
,
*NL*
in
an
enlarged
photograph
of
St.
Mark
's
that
had
been
lent
to
me
,
the
*NL*
operator
had
portrayed
,
in
a
bowler
hat
,
in
front
of
the
portico
-RRB-
,
when
*NL*
I
heard
my
father
say
:
``
It
must
be
pretty
cold
,
still
,
on
the
Grand
*NL*
Canal
;
whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
forget
to
pack
your
winter
greatcoat
and
*NL*
your
thick
suit
.
''
At
these
words
I
was
raised
to
a
sort
of
ecstasy
;
*NL*
a
thing
that
I
had
until
then
deemed
impossible
,
I
felt
myself
to
be
*NL*
penetrating
indeed
between
those
``
rocks
of
amethyst
,
like
a
reef
in
the
*NL*
Indian
Ocean
''
;
by
a
supreme
muscular
effort
,
a
long
way
in
excess
of
my
*NL*
real
strength
,
stripping
myself
,
as
of
a
shell
that
served
no
purpose
,
*NL*
of
the
air
in
my
own
room
which
surrounded
me
,
I
replaced
it
by
an
equal
*NL*
quantity
of
Venetian
air
,
that
marine
atmosphere
,
indescribable
and
*NL*
peculiar
as
the
atmosphere
of
the
dreams
which
my
imagination
had
*NL*
secreted
in
the
name
of
Venice
;
I
could
feel
at
work
within
me
a
*NL*
miraculous
disincarnation
;
it
was
at
once
accompanied
by
that
vague
*NL*
desire
to
vomit
which
one
feels
when
one
has
a
very
sore
throat
;
and
*NL*
they
had
to
put
me
to
bed
with
a
fever
so
persistent
that
the
doctor
*NL*
not
only
assured
my
parents
that
a
visit
,
that
spring
,
to
Florence
and
*NL*
Venice
was
absolutely
out
of
the
question
,
but
warned
their
that
,
even
*NL*
when
I
should
have
completely
recovered
,
I
must
,
for
at
least
a
year
,
*NL*
give
up
all
idea
of
travelling
,
and
be
kept
from
anything
that
was
*NL*
liable
to
excite
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
alas
,
he
forbade
also
,
most
categorically
,
my
being
allowed
to
go
*NL*
to
the
theatre
,
to
hear
Berma
;
the
sublime
artist
,
whose
genius
Bergotte
*NL*
had
proclaimed
,
might
,
by
introducing
me
to
something
else
that
was
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
as
important
and
as
beautiful
,
have
consoled
me
for
not
having
*NL*
been
to
Florence
and
Venice
,
for
not
going
to
Balbec
.
My
parents
had
*NL*
to
be
content
with
sending
me
,
every
day
,
to
the
Champs-Elys√©es
,
in
*NL*
the
custody
of
a
person
who
would
see
that
I
did
not
tire
myself
;
this
*NL*
person
was
none
other
than
Fran√ßoise
,
who
had
entered
our
service
*NL*
after
the
death
of
my
aunt
L√©onie
.
Going
to
the
Champs-Elys√©es
I
found
*NL*
unendurable
.
If
only
Bergotte
had
described
the
place
in
one
of
his
*NL*
books
,
I
should
,
no
doubt
,
have
longed
to
see
and
to
know
it
,
like
so
*NL*
many
things
else
of
which
a
simulacrum
had
first
found
its
way
into
*NL*
my
imagination
.
That
kept
things
warm
,
made
them
live
,
gave
them
*NL*
personality
,
and
I
sought
then
to
find
their
counterpart
in
reality
,
*NL*
but
in
this
public
garden
there
was
nothing
that
attached
itself
to
my
*NL*
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
as
I
was
weary
of
our
usual
place
,
beside
the
wooden
horses
,
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
had
taken
me
for
an
excursion
--
across
the
frontier
guarded
at
*NL*
regular
intervals
by
the
little
bastions
of
the
barley-sugar
women
--
into
*NL*
those
neighbouring
but
foreign
regions
,
where
the
faces
of
the
*NL*
passers-by
were
strange
,
where
the
goat-carriage
went
past
;
then
she
had
*NL*
gone
away
to
lay
down
her
things
on
a
chair
that
stood
with
its
back
to
*NL*
a
shrubbery
of
laurels
;
while
I
waited
for
her
I
was
pacing
the
broad
*NL*
lawn
,
of
meagre
close-cropped
grass
already
faded
by
the
sun
,
dominated
,
*NL*
at
its
far
end
,
by
a
statue
rising
from
a
fountain
,
in
front
of
which
a
*NL*
little
girl
with
reddish
hair
was
playing
with
a
shuttlecock
;
when
,
from
*NL*
the
path
,
another
little
girl
,
who
was
putting
on
her
cloak
and
covering
*NL*
up
her
battledore
,
called
out
sharply
:
``
Good-bye
,
Gilberte
,
I
'm
going
*NL*
home
now
;
do
n't
forget
,
we
're
coming
to
you
this
evening
,
after
dinner
.
''
*NL*
The
name
Gilberte
passed
close
by
me
,
evoking
all
the
more
forcibly
her
*NL*
whom
it
labelled
in
that
it
did
not
merely
refer
to
her
,
as
one
speaks
*NL*
of
a
man
in
his
absence
,
but
was
directly
addressed
to
her
;
it
passed
*NL*
thus
close
by
me
,
in
action
,
so
to
speak
,
with
a
force
that
*NL*
increased
with
the
curve
of
its
trajectory
and
as
it
drew
near
to
*NL*
its
target
;
--
carrying
in
its
wake
,
I
could
feel
,
the
knowledge
,
the
*NL*
impression
of
her
to
whom
it
was
addressed
that
belonged
not
to
me
but
*NL*
to
the
friend
who
called
to
her
,
everything
that
,
while
she
uttered
the
*NL*
words
,
she
more
or
less
vividly
reviewed
,
possessed
in
her
memory
,
of
*NL*
their
daily
intimacy
,
of
the
visits
that
they
paid
to
each
other
,
of
*NL*
that
unknown
existence
which
was
all
the
more
inaccessible
,
all
the
more
*NL*
painful
to
me
from
being
,
conversely
,
so
familiar
,
so
tractable
to
this
*NL*
happy
girl
who
let
her
message
brush
past
me
without
my
being
able
to
*NL*
penetrate
its
surface
,
who
flung
it
on
the
air
with
a
light-hearted
cry
:
*NL*
letting
float
in
the
atmosphere
the
delicious
attar
which
that
message
*NL*
had
distilled
,
by
touching
them
with
precision
,
from
certain
invisible
*NL*
points
in
Mlle.
Swann
's
life
,
from
the
evening
to
come
,
as
it
would
be
,
*NL*
after
dinner
,
at
her
home
,
--
forming
,
on
its
celestial
passage
through
*NL*
the
midst
of
the
children
and
their
nursemaids
,
a
little
cloud
,
*NL*
exquisitely
coloured
,
like
the
cloud
that
,
curling
over
one
of
Poussin
's
*NL*
gardens
,
reflects
minutely
,
like
a
cloud
in
the
opera
,
teeming
with
*NL*
chariots
and
horses
,
some
apparition
of
the
life
of
the
gods
;
casting
,
*NL*
finally
,
on
that
ragged
grass
,
at
the
spot
on
which
she
stood
-LRB-
at
once
a
*NL*
scrap
of
withered
lawn
and
a
moment
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fair
player
,
*NL*
who
continued
to
beat
up
and
catch
her
shuttlecock
until
a
governess
,
*NL*
with
a
blue
feather
in
her
hat
,
had
called
her
away
-RRB-
a
marvellous
little
*NL*
band
of
light
,
of
the
colour
of
heliotrope
,
spread
over
the
lawn
like
a
*NL*
carpet
on
which
I
could
not
tire
of
treading
to
and
fro
with
lingering
*NL*
feet
,
nostalgic
and
profane
,
while
Fran√ßoise
shouted
:
``
Come
on
,
button
*NL*
up
your
coat
,
look
,
and
let
's
get
away
!
''
and
I
remarked
for
the
first
*NL*
time
how
common
her
speech
was
,
and
that
she
had
,
alas
,
no
blue
feather
*NL*
in
her
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
would
_
she
_
come
again
to
the
Champs-Elys√©es
?
Next
day
she
was
*NL*
not
there
;
but
I
saw
her
on
the
following
days
;
I
spent
all
my
time
*NL*
revolving
round
the
spot
where
she
was
at
play
with
her
friends
,
to
such
*NL*
effect
that
once
,
when
,
they
found
,
they
were
not
enough
to
make
up
a
*NL*
prisoner
's
base
,
she
sent
one
of
them
to
ask
me
if
I
cared
to
complete
*NL*
their
side
,
and
from
that
day
I
played
with
her
whenever
she
came
.
*NL*
But
this
did
not
happen
every
day
;
there
were
days
when
she
had
*NL*
been
prevented
from
coming
by
her
lessons
,
by
her
catechism
,
by
a
*NL*
luncheon-party
,
by
the
whole
of
that
life
,
separated
from
my
own
,
which
*NL*
twice
only
,
condensed
into
the
name
of
Gilberte
,
I
had
felt
pass
so
*NL*
painfully
close
to
me
,
in
the
hawthorn
lane
near
Combray
and
on
the
*NL*
grass
of
the
Champs-Elys√©es
.
On
such
days
she
would
have
told
us
*NL*
beforehand
that
we
should
not
see
her
;
if
it
were
because
of
her
*NL*
lessons
,
she
would
say
:
``
It
is
too
tiresome
,
I
sha
'n'
t
be
able
to
come
*NL*
to-morrow
;
you
will
all
be
enjoying
yourselves
here
without
me
,
''
with
an
*NL*
air
of
regret
which
to
some
extent
consoled
me
;
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
she
had
been
invited
to
a
party
,
and
I
,
not
knowing
this
,
asked
her
*NL*
whether
she
was
coming
to
play
with
us
,
she
would
reply
:
``
Indeed
I
hope
*NL*
not
!
Indeed
I
hope
Mamma
will
let
me
go
to
my
friend
's
.
''
But
on
these
*NL*
days
I
did
at
least
know
that
I
should
not
see
her
,
whereas
on
others
,
*NL*
without
any
warning
,
her
mother
would
take
her
for
a
drive
,
or
some
such
*NL*
thing
,
and
next
day
she
would
say
:
``
Oh
,
yes
!
I
went
out
with
Mamma
,
''
*NL*
as
though
it
had
been
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
,
and
not
the
*NL*
greatest
possible
misfortune
for
some
one
else
.
There
were
also
the
days
*NL*
of
bad
weather
on
which
her
governess
,
afraid
,
on
her
own
account
,
of
*NL*
the
rain
,
would
not
bring
Gilberte
to
the
Champs-Elys√©es
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
if
the
heavens
were
doubtful
,
from
early
morning
I
would
not
*NL*
cease
to
interrogate
them
,
observing
all
the
omens
.
If
I
saw
the
lady
*NL*
opposite
,
just
inside
her
window
,
putting
on
her
hat
,
I
would
say
to
*NL*
myself
:
``
That
lady
is
going
out
;
it
must
,
therefore
,
be
weather
in
which
*NL*
one
can
go
out
.
Why
should
not
Gilberte
do
the
same
as
that
lady
?
''
But
*NL*
the
day
grew
dark
.
My
mother
said
that
it
might
clear
again
,
that
one
*NL*
burst
of
sunshine
would
be
enough
,
but
that
more
probably
it
would
rain
;
*NL*
and
if
it
rained
,
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
go
to
the
Champs-Elys√©es
?
*NL*
And
so
,
from
breakfast-time
,
my
anxious
eyes
never
left
the
uncertain
,
*NL*
clouded
sky
.
It
remained
dark
:
Outside
the
window
,
the
balcony
was
grey
.
*NL*
Suddenly
,
on
its
sullen
stone
,
I
did
not
indeed
see
a
less
negative
*NL*
colour
,
but
I
felt
as
it
were
an
effort
towards
a
less
negative
colour
,
*NL*
the
pulsation
of
a
hesitating
ray
that
struggled
to
discharge
its
light
.
*NL*
A
moment
later
the
balcony
was
as
pale
and
luminous
as
a
standing
water
*NL*
at
dawn
,
and
a
thousand
shadows
from
the
iron-work
of
its
balustrade
had
*NL*
come
to
rest
on
it
.
A
breath
of
wind
dispersed
them
;
the
stone
grew
*NL*
dark
again
,
but
,
like
tamed
creatures
,
they
returned
;
they
began
,
*NL*
imperceptibly
,
to
grow
lighter
,
and
by
one
of
those
continuous
*NL*
crescendos
,
such
as
,
in
music
,
at
the
end
of
an
overture
,
carry
a
single
*NL*
note
to
the
extreme
fortissimo
,
making
it
pass
rapidly
through
all
the
*NL*
intermediate
stages
,
I
saw
it
attain
to
that
fixed
,
unalterable
gold
of
*NL*
fine
days
,
on
which
the
sharply
cut
shadows
of
the
wrought
iron
of
the
*NL*
balustrade
were
outlined
in
black
like
a
capricious
vegetation
,
with
a
*NL*
fineness
in
the
delineation
of
their
smallest
details
which
seemed
to
*NL*
indicate
a
deliberate
application
,
an
artist
's
satisfaction
,
and
with
so
*NL*
much
relief
,
so
velvety
a
bloom
in
the
restfulness
of
their
sombre
*NL*
and
happy
mass
that
in
truth
those
large
and
leafy
shadows
which
lay
*NL*
reflected
on
that
lake
of
sunshine
seemed
aware
that
they
were
pledges
*NL*
of
happiness
and
peace
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brief
,
fading
ivy
,
climbing
,
fugitive
flora
,
the
most
colourless
,
the
*NL*
most
depressing
,
to
many
minds
,
of
all
that
creep
on
walls
or
decorate
*NL*
windows
;
to
me
the
dearest
of
them
all
,
from
the
day
when
it
appeared
*NL*
upon
our
balcony
,
like
the
very
shadow
of
the
presence
of
Gilberte
,
*NL*
who
was
perhaps
already
in
the
Champs-Elys√©es
,
and
as
soon
as
I
arrived
*NL*
there
would
greet
me
with
:
``
Let
's
begin
at
once
.
You
are
on
my
side
.
''
*NL*
Frail
,
swept
away
by
a
breath
,
but
at
the
same
time
in
harmony
,
not
with
*NL*
the
season
,
with
the
hour
;
a
promise
of
that
immediate
pleasure
which
*NL*
the
day
will
deny
or
fulfil
,
and
thereby
of
the
one
paramount
immediate
*NL*
pleasure
,
the
pleasure
of
loving
and
of
being
loved
;
more
soft
,
*NL*
more
warm
upon
the
stone
than
even
moss
is
;
alive
,
a
ray
of
sunshine
*NL*
sufficing
for
its
birth
,
and
for
the
birth
of
joy
,
even
in
the
heart
of
*NL*
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
those
days
when
all
other
vegetation
had
disappeared
,
when
the
*NL*
fine
jerkins
of
green
leather
which
covered
the
trunks
of
the
old
trees
*NL*
were
hidden
beneath
the
snow
;
after
the
snow
had
ceased
to
fall
,
but
*NL*
when
the
sky
was
still
too
much
overcast
for
me
to
hope
that
Gilberte
*NL*
would
venture
out
,
then
suddenly
--
inspiring
my
mother
to
say
:
``
Look
,
*NL*
it
's
quite
fine
now
;
I
think
you
might
perhaps
try
going
to
the
*NL*
Champs-Elys√©es
after
all
.
''
--
On
the
mantle
of
snow
that
swathed
the
*NL*
balcony
,
the
sun
had
appeared
and
was
stitching
seams
of
gold
,
with
*NL*
embroidered
patches
of
dark
shadow
.
That
day
we
found
no
one
there
,
or
*NL*
else
a
solitary
girl
,
on
the
point
of
departure
,
who
assured
me
that
*NL*
Gilberte
was
not
coming
.
The
chairs
,
deserted
by
the
imposing
but
*NL*
uninspiring
company
of
governesses
,
stood
empty
.
Only
,
near
the
grass
,
*NL*
was
sitting
a
lady
of
uncertain
age
who
came
in
all
weathers
,
dressed
*NL*
always
in
an
identical
style
,
splendid
and
sombre
,
to
make
whose
*NL*
acquaintance
I
would
have
,
at
that
period
,
sacrificed
,
had
it
lain
in
my
*NL*
power
,
all
the
greatest
opportunities
in
my
life
to
come
.
For
Gilberte
*NL*
went
up
every
day
to
speak
to
her
;
she
used
to
ask
Gilberte
for
news
of
*NL*
her
``
dearest
mother
''
and
it
struck
me
that
,
if
I
had
known
her
,
I
should
*NL*
have
been
for
Gilberte
some
one
wholly
different
,
some
one
who
knew
*NL*
people
in
her
parents
'
world
.
While
her
grandchildren
played
together
at
*NL*
a
little
distance
,
she
would
sit
and
read
the
D√©bats
,
which
she
called
*NL*
``
My
old
_
D√©bats
_
!
''
as
,
with
an
aristocratic
familiarity
,
she
would
say
,
*NL*
speaking
of
the
police-sergeant
or
the
woman
who
let
the
chairs
,
``
My
*NL*
old
friend
the
police-sergeant
,
''
or
``
The
chair-keeper
and
I
,
who
are
old
*NL*
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
found
it
too
cold
to
stand
about
,
so
we
walked
to
the
Pont
*NL*
de
la
Concorde
to
see
the
Seine
frozen
over
,
on
to
which
everyone
,
even
*NL*
children
,
walked
fearlessly
,
as
though
upon
an
enormous
whale
,
stranded
,
*NL*
defenceless
,
and
about
to
be
cut
up
.
We
returned
to
the
Champs-Elys√©es
;
*NL*
I
was
growing
sick
with
misery
between
the
motionless
wooden
horses
and
*NL*
the
white
lawn
,
caught
in
a
net
of
black
paths
from
which
the
snow
had
*NL*
been
cleared
,
while
the
statue
that
surmounted
it
held
in
its
hand
a
*NL*
long
pendent
icicle
which
seemed
to
explain
its
gesture
.
The
old
lady
*NL*
herself
,
having
folded
up
her
_
D√©bats
_
,
asked
a
passing
nursemaid
*NL*
the
time
,
thanking
her
with
``
How
very
good
of
you
!
''
then
begged
the
*NL*
road-sweeper
to
tell
her
grandchildren
to
come
,
as
she
felt
cold
,
adding
*NL*
``
A
thousand
thanks
.
I
am
sorry
to
give
you
so
much
trouble
!
''
Suddenly
*NL*
the
sky
was
rent
in
two
:
between
the
punch-and-judy
and
the
horses
,
*NL*
against
the
opening
horizon
,
I
had
just
seen
,
like
a
miraculous
sign
,
*NL*
Mademoiselle
's
blue
feather
.
And
now
Gilberte
was
running
at
full
speed
*NL*
towards
me
,
sparkling
and
rosy
beneath
a
cap
trimmed
with
fur
,
enlivened
*NL*
by
the
cold
,
by
being
late
,
by
her
anxiety
for
a
game
;
shortly
before
*NL*
she
reached
me
,
she
slipped
on
a
piece
of
ice
and
,
either
to
regain
her
*NL*
balance
,
or
because
it
appeared
to
her
graceful
,
or
else
pretending
*NL*
that
she
was
on
skates
,
it
was
with
outstretched
arms
that
she
smilingly
*NL*
advanced
,
as
though
to
embrace
me
.
``
Bravo
!
bravo
!
that
's
splendid
;
*NL*
`
topping
,
'
I
should
say
,
like
you
--
`
sporting
,
'
I
suppose
I
ought
to
say
,
*NL*
only
I
'm
a
hundred-and-one
,
a
woman
of
the
old
school
,
''
exclaimed
the
*NL*
lady
,
uttering
,
on
behalf
of
the
voiceless
Champs-Elys√©es
,
their
thanks
*NL*
to
Gilberte
for
having
come
,
without
letting
herself
be
frightened
*NL*
away
by
the
weather
.
``
You
are
like
me
,
faithful
at
all
costs
to
our
old
*NL*
Champs-Elys√©es
;
we
are
two
brave
souls
!
You
would
n't
believe
me
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
,
if
I
told
you
that
I
love
them
,
even
like
this
.
This
snow
-LRB-
I
know
,
*NL*
you
'll
laugh
at
me
-RRB-
,
it
makes
me
think
of
ermine
!
''
And
the
old
lady
*NL*
began
to
laugh
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
of
these
days
--
to
which
the
snow
,
a
symbol
of
the
powers
that
*NL*
were
able
to
deprive
me
of
the
sight
of
Gilberte
,
imparted
the
sadness
*NL*
of
a
day
of
separation
,
almost
the
aspect
of
a
day
of
departure
,
because
*NL*
it
changed
the
outward
form
and
almost
forbade
the
use
of
the
customary
*NL*
scene
of
our
only
encounters
,
now
altered
,
covered
,
as
it
were
,
in
*NL*
dust-sheets
--
that
day
,
none
the
less
,
marked
a
stage
in
the
progress
of
*NL*
my
love
,
for
it
was
,
in
a
sense
,
the
first
sorrow
that
she
was
to
share
*NL*
with
me
.
There
were
only
our
two
selves
of
our
little
company
,
and
to
*NL*
be
thus
alone
with
her
was
not
merely
like
a
beginning
of
intimacy
,
but
*NL*
also
on
her
part
--
as
though
she
had
come
there
solely
to
please
me
,
and
*NL*
in
such
weather
--
it
seemed
to
me
as
touching
as
if
,
on
one
of
those
days
*NL*
on
which
she
had
been
invited
to
a
party
,
she
had
given
it
up
in
order
*NL*
to
come
to
me
in
the
Champs-Elys√©es
;
I
acquired
more
confidence
in
the
*NL*
vitality
,
in
the
future
of
a
friendship
which
could
remain
so
much
alive
*NL*
amid
the
torpor
,
the
solitude
,
the
decay
of
our
surroundings
;
and
while
*NL*
she
dropped
pellets
of
snow
down
my
neck
,
I
smiled
lovingly
at
what
*NL*
seemed
to
me
at
once
a
predilection
that
she
shewed
for
me
in
thus
*NL*
tolerating
me
as
her
travelling
companion
in
this
new
,
this
wintry
land
,
*NL*
and
a
sort
of
loyalty
to
me
which
she
preserved
through
evil
times
.
*NL*
Presently
,
one
after
another
,
like
shyly
bopping
sparrows
,
her
friends
*NL*
arrived
,
black
against
the
snow
.
We
got
ready
to
play
and
,
since
this
*NL*
day
which
had
begun
so
sadly
was
destined
to
end
in
joy
,
as
I
went
up
,
*NL*
before
the
game
started
,
to
the
friend
with
the
sharp
voice
whom
I
had
*NL*
heard
,
that
first
day
,
calling
Gilberte
by
name
,
she
said
to
me
:
``
No
,
*NL*
no
,
I
'm
sure
you
'd
much
rather
be
in
Gilberte
's
camp
;
besides
,
look
,
*NL*
she
's
signalling
to
you
.
''
She
was
in
fact
summoning
me
to
cross
the
*NL*
snowy
lawn
to
her
camp
,
to
`
take
the
field
,
'
which
the
sun
,
by
casting
*NL*
over
it
a
rosy
gleam
,
the
metallic
lustre
of
old
and
worn
brocades
,
had
*NL*
turned
into
a
Field
of
the
Cloth
of
Gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
day
,
which
I
had
begun
with
so
many
misgivings
,
was
,
as
it
*NL*
happened
,
one
of
the
few
on
which
I
was
not
unduly
wretched
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
although
I
no
longer
thought
,
now
,
of
anything
save
not
to
let
a
*NL*
single
day
pass
without
seeing
Gilberte
-LRB-
so
much
so
that
once
,
when
my
*NL*
grandmother
had
not
come
home
by
dinner-time
,
I
could
not
resist
the
*NL*
instinctive
reflection
that
,
if
she
had
been
run
over
in
the
street
*NL*
and
killed
,
I
should
not
for
some
time
be
allowed
to
play
in
the
*NL*
Champs-Elys√©es
;
when
one
is
in
love
one
has
no
love
left
for
anyone
-RRB-
,
*NL*
yet
those
moments
which
I
spent
in
her
company
,
for
which
I
had
waited
*NL*
with
so
much
impatience
all
night
and
morning
,
for
which
I
had
quivered
*NL*
with
excitement
,
to
which
I
would
have
sacrificed
everything
else
in
the
*NL*
world
,
were
by
no
means
happy
moments
;
well
did
I
know
it
,
for
they
*NL*
were
the
only
moments
in
my
life
on
which
I
concentrated
a
scrupulous
,
*NL*
undistracted
attention
,
and
yet
I
could
not
discover
in
them
one
atom
*NL*
of
pleasure
.
All
the
time
that
I
was
away
from
Gilberte
,
I
wanted
to
see
*NL*
her
,
because
,
having
incessantly
sought
to
form
a
mental
picture
of
her
,
*NL*
I
was
unable
,
in
the
end
,
to
do
so
,
and
did
not
know
exactly
to
what
my
*NL*
love
corresponded
.
Besides
,
she
had
never
yet
told
me
that
she
loved
me
.
*NL*
Far
from
it
,
she
had
often
boasted
that
she
knew
other
little
boys
whom
*NL*
she
preferred
to
myself
,
that
I
was
a
good
companion
,
with
whom
she
was
*NL*
always
willing
to
play
,
although
I
was
too
absent-minded
,
not
attentive
*NL*
enough
to
the
game
.
Moreover
,
she
had
often
shewn
signs
of
apparent
*NL*
coldness
towards
me
,
which
might
have
shaken
my
faith
that
I
was
for
her
*NL*
a
creature
different
from
the
rest
,
had
that
faith
been
founded
upon
a
*NL*
love
that
Gilberte
had
felt
for
me
,
and
not
,
as
was
the
case
,
upon
*NL*
the
love
that
I
felt
for
her
,
which
strengthened
its
resistance
to
the
*NL*
assaults
of
doubt
by
making
it
depend
entirely
upon
the
manner
in
which
*NL*
I
was
obliged
,
by
an
internal
compulsion
,
to
think
of
Gilberte
.
But
my
*NL*
feelings
with
regard
to
her
I
had
never
yet
ventured
to
express
to
her
*NL*
in
words
.
Of
course
,
on
every
page
of
my
exercise-books
,
I
wrote
out
,
*NL*
in
endless
repetition
,
her
name
and
address
,
but
at
the
sight
of
those
*NL*
vague
lines
which
I
might
trace
,
without
her
having
to
think
,
on
that
*NL*
account
,
of
me
,
I
felt
discouraged
,
because
they
spoke
to
me
,
not
of
*NL*
Gilberte
,
who
would
never
so
much
as
see
them
,
but
of
my
own
desire
,
*NL*
which
they
seemed
to
shew
me
in
its
true
colours
,
as
something
purely
*NL*
personal
,
unreal
,
tedious
and
ineffective
.
The
most
important
thing
*NL*
was
that
we
should
see
each
other
,
Gilberte
and
I
,
and
should
have
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
making
a
mutual
confession
of
our
love
which
,
until
then
,
*NL*
would
not
officially
-LRB-
so
to
speak
-RRB-
have
begun
.
Doubtless
the
various
*NL*
reasons
which
made
me
so
impatient
to
see
her
would
have
appeared
less
*NL*
urgent
to
a
grown
man
.
As
life
goes
on
,
we
acquire
such
adroitness
in
*NL*
the
culture
of
our
pleasures
,
that
we
content
ourselves
with
that
which
*NL*
we
derive
from
thinking
of
a
woman
,
as
I
was
thinking
of
Gilberte
,
*NL*
without
troubling
ourselves
to
ascertain
whether
the
image
corresponds
*NL*
to
the
reality
,
--
and
with
the
pleasure
of
loving
her
,
without
needing
to
*NL*
be
sure
,
also
,
that
she
loves
us
;
or
again
that
we
renounce
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
confessing
our
passion
for
her
,
so
as
to
preserve
and
enhance
the
*NL*
passion
that
she
has
for
us
,
like
those
Japanese
gardeners
who
,
to
*NL*
obtain
one
perfect
blossom
,
will
sacrifice
the
rest
.
But
at
the
period
*NL*
when
I
was
in
love
with
Gilberte
,
I
still
believed
that
Love
did
really
*NL*
exist
,
apart
from
ourselves
;
that
,
allowing
us
,
at
the
most
,
to
surmount
*NL*
the
obstacles
in
our
way
,
it
offered
us
its
blessings
in
an
order
in
*NL*
which
we
were
not
free
to
make
the
least
alteration
;
it
seemed
to
me
*NL*
that
if
I
had
,
on
my
own
initiative
,
substituted
for
the
sweetness
of
*NL*
a
confession
a
pretence
of
indifference
,
I
should
not
only
have
been
*NL*
depriving
myself
of
one
of
the
joys
of
which
I
had
most
often
dreamed
,
*NL*
I
should
have
been
fabricating
,
of
my
own
free
will
,
a
love
that
was
*NL*
artificial
and
without
value
,
that
bore
no
relation
to
the
truth
,
whose
*NL*
mysterious
and
foreordained
ways
I
should
thus
have
been
declining
to
*NL*
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
I
arrived
at
the
Champs-Elys√©es
,
--
and
,
as
at
first
sight
*NL*
it
appeared
,
was
in
a
position
to
confront
my
love
,
so
as
to
make
it
*NL*
undergo
the
necessary
modifications
,
with
its
living
and
independent
*NL*
cause
--
as
soon
as
I
was
in
the
presence
of
that
Gilberte
Swann
on
the
*NL*
sight
of
whom
I
had
counted
to
revive
the
images
that
my
tired
memory
*NL*
had
lost
and
could
not
find
again
,
of
that
Gilberte
Swann
with
whom
I
*NL*
had
been
playing
the
day
before
,
and
whom
I
had
just
been
prompted
to
*NL*
greet
,
and
then
to
recognise
,
by
a
blind
instinct
like
that
which
,
when
*NL*
we
are
walking
,
sets
one
foot
before
the
other
,
without
giving
us
time
*NL*
to
think
what
we
are
doing
,
then
at
once
it
became
as
though
she
and
the
*NL*
little
girl
who
had
inspired
my
dreams
had
been
two
different
people
.
*NL*
If
,
for
instance
,
I
had
retained
in
my
memory
overnight
two
fiery
eyes
*NL*
above
plump
and
rosy
cheeks
,
Gilberte
's
face
would
now
offer
me
-LRB-
and
*NL*
with
emphasis
-RRB-
something
that
I
distinctly
had
not
remembered
,
a
*NL*
certain
sharpening
and
prolongation
of
the
nose
which
,
instantaneously
*NL*
associating
itself
with
certain
others
of
her
features
,
assumed
the
*NL*
importance
of
those
characteristics
which
,
in
natural
history
,
are
used
*NL*
to
define
a
species
,
and
transformed
her
into
a
little
girl
of
the
kind
*NL*
that
have
sharpened
profiles
.
While
I
was
making
myself
ready
to
take
*NL*
advantage
of
this
long
expected
moment
,
and
to
surrender
myself
to
the
*NL*
impression
of
Gilberte
which
I
had
prepared
beforehand
but
could
no
*NL*
longer
find
in
my
head
,
to
an
extent
which
would
enable
me
,
during
the
*NL*
long
hours
which
I
must
spend
alone
,
to
be
certain
that
it
was
indeed
*NL*
herself
whom
I
had
in
mind
,
that
it
was
indeed
my
love
for
her
that
I
*NL*
was
gradually
making
grow
,
as
a
book
grows
when
one
is
writing
it
,
she
*NL*
threw
me
a
ball
;
and
,
like
the
idealist
philosopher
whose
body
takes
*NL*
account
of
the
external
world
in
the
reality
of
which
his
intellect
*NL*
declines
to
believe
,
the
same
self
which
had
made
me
salute
her
before
I
*NL*
had
identified
her
now
urged
me
to
catch
the
ball
that
she
tossed
to
me
*NL*
-LRB-
as
though
she
had
been
a
companion
,
with
whom
I
had
come
to
play
,
and
*NL*
not
a
sister-soul
with
whom
my
soul
had
come
to
be
united
-RRB-
,
made
me
,
*NL*
out
of
politeness
,
until
the
time
came
when
she
had
to
I
go
,
address
*NL*
a
thousand
polite
and
trivial
remarks
to
her
,
and
so
prevented
me
both
*NL*
from
keeping
a
silence
in
which
I
might
at
last
have
laid
my
hand
upon
*NL*
the
indispensable
,
escaped
idea
,
and
from
uttering
the
words
which
might
*NL*
have
made
that
definite
progress
in
the
course
of
our
love
on
which
I
*NL*
was
always
obliged
to
count
only
for
the
following
afternoon
.
There
was
,
*NL*
however
,
an
occasional
development
.
One
day
,
we
had
gone
with
Gilberte
*NL*
to
the
stall
of
our
own
special
vendor
,
who
was
always
particularly
*NL*
nice
to
us
,
since
it
was
to
her
that
M.
Swann
used
to
send
for
his
*NL*
gingerbread
,
of
which
,
for
reasons
of
health
-LRB-
he
suffered
from
a
racial
*NL*
eczema
,
and
from
the
constipation
of
the
prophets
-RRB-
,
he
consumed
a
great
*NL*
quantity
,
--
Gilberte
pointed
out
to
me
with
a
laugh
two
little
boys
who
*NL*
were
like
the
little
artist
and
the
little
naturalist
in
the
children
's
*NL*
storybooks
.
For
one
of
them
would
not
have
a
red
stick
of
rock
because
*NL*
he
preferred
the
purple
,
while
the
other
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
*NL*
refused
a
plum
which
his
nurse
was
buying
for
him
,
because
,
as
he
*NL*
finally
explained
in
passionate
tones
:
``
I
want
the
other
plum
;
it
's
got
*NL*
a
worm
in
it
!
''
I
purchased
two
ha
`
penny
marbles
.
With
admiring
eyes
I
*NL*
saw
,
luminous
and
imprisoned
in
a
bowl
by
themselves
,
the
agate
marbles
*NL*
which
seemed
precious
to
me
because
they
were
as
fair
and
smiling
as
*NL*
little
girls
,
and
because
they
cost
five-pence
each
.
Gilberte
,
who
was
*NL*
given
a
great
deal
more
pocket
money
than
I
ever
had
,
asked
me
which
I
*NL*
thought
the
prettiest
.
They
were
as
transparent
,
as
liquid-seeming
as
*NL*
life
itself
.
I
would
not
have
had
her
sacrifice
a
single
one
of
them
.
*NL*
I
should
have
liked
her
to
be
able
to
buy
them
,
to
liberate
them
all
.
*NL*
Still
,
I
pointed
out
one
that
had
the
same
colour
as
her
eyes
.
Gilberte
*NL*
took
it
,
turned
it
about
until
it
shone
with
a
ray
of
gold
,
fondled
it
,
*NL*
paid
its
ransom
,
but
at
once
handed
me
her
captive
,
saying
:
``
Take
it
;
it
*NL*
is
for
you
,
I
give
it
to
you
,
keep
it
to
remind
yourself
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
time
,
being
still
obsessed
by
the
desire
to
hear
Berma
in
*NL*
classic
drama
,
I
had
asked
her
whether
she
had
not
a
copy
of
a
pamphlet
*NL*
in
which
Bergotte
spoke
of
Racine
,
and
which
was
now
out
of
print
.
She
*NL*
had
told
me
to
let
her
know
the
exact
title
of
it
,
and
that
evening
*NL*
I
had
sent
her
a
little
telegram
,
writing
on
its
envelope
the
name
,
*NL*
Gilberte
Swann
,
which
I
had
so
often
,
traced
in
my
exercise-books
.
Next
*NL*
day
she
brought
me
in
a
parcel
tied
with
pink
bows
and
sealed
with
white
*NL*
wax
,
the
pamphlet
,
a
copy
of
which
she
had
managed
to
find
.
``
You
see
,
it
*NL*
is
what
you
asked
me
for
,
''
she
said
,
taking
from
her
muff
the
telegram
*NL*
that
I
had
sent
her
.
But
in
the
address
on
the
pneumatic
message
--
which
,
*NL*
only
yesterday
,
was
nothing
,
was
merely
a
`
little
blue
'
that
I
had
*NL*
written
,
and
,
after
a
messenger
had
delivered
it
to
Gilberte
's
porter
*NL*
and
a
servant
had
taken
it
to
her
in
her
room
,
had
become
a
thing
*NL*
without
value
or
distinction
,
one
of
the
`
little
blues
'
that
she
had
*NL*
received
in
the
course
of
the
day
--
I
had
difficulty
in
recognising
*NL*
the
futile
,
straggling
lines
of
my
own
handwriting
beneath
the
circles
*NL*
stamped
on
it
at
the
post-office
,
the
inscriptions
added
in
pencil
by
*NL*
a
postman
,
signs
of
effectual
realisation
,
seals
of
the
external
world
,
*NL*
violet
bands
symbolical
of
life
itself
,
which
for
the
first
time
came
to
*NL*
espouse
,
to
maintain
,
to
raise
,
to
rejoice
my
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
another
day
on
which
she
said
to
me
:
``
You
know
,
you
may
*NL*
call
me
`
Gilberte
'
;
in
any
case
,
I
'm
going
to
call
you
by
your
first
*NL*
name
.
It
's
too
silly
not
to
.
''
Yet
she
continued
for
a
while
to
address
*NL*
me
by
the
more
formal
'
_
vous
_
,
'
and
,
when
I
drew
her
attention
to
this
,
*NL*
smiled
,
and
composing
,
constructing
a
phrase
like
those
that
are
put
*NL*
into
the
grammar-books
of
foreign
languages
with
no
other
object
than
to
*NL*
teach
us
to
make
use
of
a
new
word
,
ended
it
with
my
Christian
name
.
And
*NL*
when
I
recalled
,
later
,
what
I
had
felt
at
the
time
,
I
could
distinguish
*NL*
the
impression
of
having
been
held
,
for
a
moment
,
in
her
mouth
,
myself
,
*NL*
naked
,
without
,
any
longer
,
any
of
the
social
qualifications
which
*NL*
belonged
equally
to
her
other
companions
and
,
when
she
used
my
surname
,
*NL*
to
my
parents
,
accessories
of
which
her
lips
--
by
the
effort
that
she
*NL*
made
,
a
little
after
her
father
's
manner
,
to
articulate
the
words
to
*NL*
which
she
wished
to
give
a
special
value
--
had
the
air
of
stripping
,
of
*NL*
divesting
me
,
as
one
peels
the
skin
from
a
fruit
of
which
one
is
going
*NL*
to
put
only
the
pulp
into
one
's
mouth
,
while
her
glance
,
adapting
itself
*NL*
to
the
same
new
degree
of
intimacy
as
her
speech
,
fell
on
me
also
more
*NL*
directly
,
not
without
testifying
to
the
consciousness
,
the
pleasure
,
*NL*
even
the
gratitude
that
it
felt
,
accompanying
itself
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
actual
moment
,
I
was
not
able
to
appreciate
the
worth
of
*NL*
these
new
pleasures
.
They
were
given
,
not
by
the
little
girl
whom
I
*NL*
loved
,
to
me
who
loved
her
,
but
by
the
other
,
her
with
whom
I
used
to
*NL*
play
,
to
my
other
self
,
who
possessed
neither
the
memory
of
the
true
*NL*
Gilberte
,
nor
the
fixed
heart
which
alone
could
have
known
the
value
*NL*
of
a
happiness
for
which
it
alone
had
longed
.
Even
after
I
had
returned
*NL*
home
I
did
not
taste
them
,
since
,
every
day
,
the
necessity
which
made
*NL*
me
hope
that
on
the
morrow
I
should
arrive
at
the
clear
,
calm
,
happy
*NL*
contemplation
of
Gilberte
,
that
she
would
at
last
confess
her
love
*NL*
for
me
,
explaining
to
me
the
reasons
by
which
she
had
been
obliged
,
*NL*
hitherto
,
to
conceal
it
,
that
same
necessity
forced
me
to
regard
the
*NL*
past
as
of
no
account
,
to
look
ahead
of
me
only
,
to
consider
the
little
*NL*
advantages
that
she
had
given
me
not
in
themselves
and
as
if
they
were
*NL*
self-sufficient
,
but
like
fresh
rungs
of
the
ladder
on
which
I
might
*NL*
set
my
feet
,
which
were
going
to
allow
me
to
advance
a
step
further
and
*NL*
finally
to
attain
the
happiness
which
I
had
not
yet
encountered
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
at
times
,
she
shewed
me
these
marks
of
her
affection
,
she
troubled
*NL*
me
also
by
seeming
not
to
be
pleased
to
see
me
,
and
this
happened
often
*NL*
on
the
very
days
on
which
I
had
most
counted
for
the
realisation
of
my
*NL*
hopes
.
I
was
sure
that
Gilberte
was
coming
to
the
Champs-Elys√©es
,
and
*NL*
I
felt
an
elation
which
seemed
merely
the
anticipation
of
a
great
*NL*
happiness
when
--
going
into
the
drawing-room
in
the
morning
to
kiss
*NL*
Mamma
,
who
was
already
dressed
to
go
out
,
the
coils
of
her
black
hair
*NL*
elaborately
built
up
,
and
her
beautiful
hands
,
plump
and
white
,
fragrant
*NL*
still
with
soap
--
I
had
been
apprised
,
by
seeing
a
column
of
dust
*NL*
standing
by
itself
in
the
air
above
the
piano
,
and
by
hearing
a
*NL*
barrel-organ
playing
,
beneath
the
window
,
_
En
revenant
de
la
revue
_
,
*NL*
that
the
winter
had
received
,
until
nightfall
,
an
unexpected
,
radiant
*NL*
visit
from
a
day
of
spring
.
While
we
sat
at
luncheon
,
by
opening
her
*NL*
window
,
the
lady
opposite
had
sent
packing
,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
*NL*
from
beside
my
chair
--
to
sweep
in
a
single
stride
over
the
whole
width
*NL*
of
our
dining-room
--
a
sunbeam
which
had
lain
down
there
for
its
midday
*NL*
rest
and
returned
to
continue
it
there
a
moment
later
.
At
school
,
during
*NL*
the
one
o'clock
lesson
,
the
sun
made
me
sick
with
impatience
and
boredom
*NL*
as
it
let
fall
a
golden
stream
that
crept
to
the
edge
of
my
desk
,
like
*NL*
an
invitation
to
the
feast
at
which
I
could
not
myself
arrive
before
*NL*
three
o'clock
,
until
the
moment
when
Fran√ßoise
came
to
fetch
me
at
the
*NL*
school-gate
,
and
we
made
our
way
towards
the
Champs-Elys√©es
through
*NL*
streets
decorated
with
sunlight
,
dense
with
people
,
over
which
the
*NL*
balconies
,
detached
by
the
sun
and
made
vaporous
,
seemed
to
float
in
*NL*
front
of
the
houses
like
clouds
of
gold
.
Alas
!
in
the
Champs-Elys√©es
*NL*
I
found
no
Gilberte
;
she
had
not
yet
arrived
.
Motionless
,
on
the
lawn
*NL*
nurtured
by
the
invisible
sun
which
,
here
and
there
,
kindled
to
a
flame
*NL*
the
point
of
a
blade
of
grass
,
while
the
pigeons
that
had
alighted
upon
*NL*
it
had
the
appearance
of
ancient
sculptures
which
the
gardener
's
pick
*NL*
had
heaved
to
the
surface
of
a
hallowed
soil
,
I
stood
with
my
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
the
horizon
,
expecting
at
every
moment
to
see
appear
the
form
of
*NL*
Gilberte
following
that
of
her
governess
,
behind
the
statue
that
*NL*
seemed
to
be
holding
out
the
child
,
which
it
had
in
its
arms
,
and
which
*NL*
glistened
in
the
stream
of
light
,
to
receive
benediction
from
the
*NL*
sun
.
The
old
lady
who
read
the
D√©bats
was
sitting
on
her
chair
,
in
her
*NL*
invariable
place
,
and
had
just
accosted
a
park-keeper
,
with
a
friendly
*NL*
wave
of
her
hands
towards
him
as
she
exclaimed
``
What
a
lovely
day
!
''
And
*NL*
when
the
chair-woman
came
up
to
collect
her
penny
,
with
an
infinity
of
*NL*
smirks
and
affectations
she
folded
the
ticket
away
inside
her
glove
,
*NL*
as
though
it
had
been
a
posy
of
flowers
,
for
which
she
had
sought
,
in
*NL*
gratitude
to
the
donor
,
the
most
becoming
place
upon
her
person
.
When
*NL*
she
had
found
it
,
she
performed
a
circular
movement
with
her
neck
,
*NL*
straightened
her
boa
,
and
fastened
upon
the
collector
,
as
she
shewed
*NL*
her
the
end
of
yellow
paper
that
stuck
out
over
her
bare
wrist
,
the
*NL*
bewitching
smile
with
which
a
woman
says
to
a
young
man
,
pointing
to
her
*NL*
bosom
:
``
You
see
,
I
'm
wearing
your
roses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
dragged
Fran√ßoise
,
on
the
way
towards
Gilberte
,
as
far
as
the
Arc
*NL*
de
Triomphe
;
we
did
not
meet
her
,
and
I
was
returning
towards
the
lawn
*NL*
convinced
,
now
,
that
she
was
not
coming
,
when
,
in
front
of
the
wooden
*NL*
horses
,
the
little
girl
with
the
sharp
voice
flung
herself
upon
me
:
*NL*
``
Quick
,
quick
,
Gilberte
's
been
here
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
She
's
just
*NL*
going
.
We
've
been
waiting
for
you
,
to
make
up
a
prisoner
's
base
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
had
been
going
up
the
Avenue
des
Champs-Elys√©es
,
Gilberte
had
*NL*
arrived
by
the
Rue
Boissy-d'Anglas
,
Mademoiselle
having
taken
advantage
*NL*
of
the
fine
weather
to
go
on
some
errand
of
her
own
;
and
M.
Swann
was
*NL*
coming
to
fetch
his
daughter
.
And
so
it
was
my
fault
;
I
ought
not
to
*NL*
have
strayed
from
the
lawn
;
for
one
never
knew
for
certain
from
what
*NL*
direction
Gilberte
would
appear
,
whether
she
would
be
early
or
late
,
and
*NL*
this
perpetual
tension
succeeded
in
making
more
impressive
not
only
the
*NL*
Champs-Elys√©es
in
their
entirety
,
and
the
whole
span
of
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
like
a
vast
expanse
of
space
and
time
,
on
every
point
and
at
every
*NL*
moment
of
which
it
was
possible
that
the
form
of
Gilberte
might
appear
,
*NL*
but
also
that
form
itself
,
since
behind
its
appearance
I
felt
that
there
*NL*
lay
concealed
the
reason
for
which
it
had
shot
its
arrow
into
my
heart
*NL*
at
four
o'clock
instead
of
at
half-past
two
;
crowned
with
a
smart
hat
,
*NL*
for
paying
calls
,
instead
of
the
plain
cap
,
for
games
;
in
front
of
the
*NL*
Ambassadeurs
and
not
between
the
two
puppet-shows
;
I
divined
one
of
*NL*
those
occupations
in
which
I
might
not
follow
Gilberte
,
occupations
*NL*
that
forced
her
to
go
out
or
to
stay
at
home
,
I
was
in
contact
with
the
*NL*
mystery
of
her
unknown
life
.
It
was
this
mystery
,
too
,
which
troubled
*NL*
me
when
,
running
at
the
sharp-voiced
girl
's
bidding
,
so
as
to
begin
our
*NL*
game
without
more
delay
,
I
saw
Gilberte
,
so
quick
and
informal
with
*NL*
us
,
make
a
ceremonious
bow
to
the
old
lady
with
the
_
D√©bats
_
-LRB-
who
*NL*
acknowledged
it
with
``
What
a
lovely
sun
!
You
'd
think
there
was
a
fire
*NL*
burning
.
''
-RRB-
speaking
to
her
with
a
shy
smile
,
with
an
air
of
constraint
*NL*
which
called
to
my
mind
the
other
little
girl
that
Gilberte
must
be
when
*NL*
at
home
with
her
parents
,
or
with
friends
of
her
parents
,
paying
*NL*
visits
,
in
all
the
rest
,
that
escaped
me
,
of
her
existence
.
But
of
that
*NL*
existence
no
one
gave
me
so
strong
an
impression
as
did
M.
Swann
,
who
*NL*
came
a
little
later
to
fetch
his
daughter
.
That
was
because
he
and
Mme.
*NL*
Swann
--
inasmuch
as
their
daughter
lived
with
them
,
as
her
lessons
,
*NL*
her
games
,
her
friendships
depended
upon
them
--
contained
for
me
,
like
*NL*
Gilberte
,
perhaps
even
more
than
Gilberte
,
as
befitted
subjects
that
had
*NL*
an
all-powerful
control
over
her
in
whom
it
must
have
had
its
source
,
an
*NL*
undefined
,
an
inaccessible
quality
of
melancholy
charm
.
Everything
that
*NL*
concerned
them
was
on
my
part
the
object
of
so
constant
a
preoccupation
*NL*
that
the
days
on
which
,
as
on
this
day
,
M.
Swann
-LRB-
whom
I
had
seen
so
*NL*
often
,
long
ago
,
without
his
having
aroused
my
curiosity
,
when
he
*NL*
was
still
on
good
terms
with
my
parents
-RRB-
came
for
Gilberte
to
the
*NL*
Champs-Elys√©es
,
once
the
pulsations
to
which
my
heart
had
been
excited
*NL*
by
the
appearance
of
his
grey
hat
and
hooded
cape
had
subsided
,
the
*NL*
sight
of
him
still
impressed
me
as
might
that
of
an
historic
personage
,
*NL*
upon
whom
one
had
just
been
studying
a
series
of
books
,
and
the
smallest
*NL*
details
of
whose
life
one
learned
with
enthusiasm
.
His
relations
with
*NL*
the
Comte
de
Paris
,
which
,
when
I
heard
them
discussed
at
Combray
,
*NL*
seemed
to
me
unimportant
,
became
now
in
my
eyes
something
marvellous
,
*NL*
as
if
no
one
else
had
ever
known
the
House
of
Orleans
;
they
set
him
*NL*
in
vivid
detachment
against
the
vulgar
background
of
pedestrians
*NL*
of
different
classes
,
who
encumbered
that
particular
path
in
the
*NL*
Champs-Elys√©es
,
in
the
midst
of
whom
I
admired
his
condescending
to
*NL*
figure
without
claiming
any
special
deference
,
which
as
it
happened
none
*NL*
of
them
dreamed
of
paying
him
,
so
profound
was
the
incognito
in
which
he
*NL*
was
wrapped
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
responded
politely
to
the
salutations
of
Gilberte
's
companions
,
even
*NL*
to
mine
,
for
all
that
he
was
no
longer
on
good
terms
with
my
family
,
*NL*
but
without
appearing
to
know
who
I
was
.
-LRB-
This
reminded
me
that
he
had
*NL*
constantly
seen
me
in
the
country
;
a
memory
which
I
had
retained
,
but
*NL*
kept
out
of
sight
,
because
,
since
I
had
seen
Gilberte
again
,
Swann
had
*NL*
become
to
me
pre-eminently
her
father
,
and
no
longer
the
Combray
Swann
;
*NL*
as
the
ideas
which
,
nowadays
,
I
made
his
name
connote
were
different
*NL*
from
the
ideas
in
the
system
of
which
it
was
formerly
comprised
,
which
*NL*
I
utilised
not
at
all
now
when
I
had
occasion
to
think
of
him
,
he
had
*NL*
become
a
new
,
another
person
;
still
I
attached
him
by
an
artificial
*NL*
thread
,
secondary
and
transversal
,
to
our
former
guest
;
and
as
nothing
*NL*
had
any
longer
any
value
for
me
save
in
the
extent
to
which
my
love
*NL*
might
profit
by
it
,
it
was
with
a
spasm
of
shame
and
of
regret
at
not
*NL*
being
able
to
erase
them
from
my
memory
that
I
recaptured
the
years
in
*NL*
which
,
in
the
eyes
of
this
same
Swann
who
was
at
this
moment
before
me
*NL*
in
the
Champs-Elys√©es
,
and
to
whom
,
fortunately
,
Gilberte
had
perhaps
*NL*
not
mentioned
my
name
,
I
had
so
often
,
in
the
evenings
,
made
myself
*NL*
ridiculous
by
sending
to
ask
Mamma
to
come
upstairs
to
my
room
to
say
*NL*
good-night
to
me
,
while
she
was
drinking
coffee
with
him
and
my
father
*NL*
and
my
grandparents
at
the
table
in
the
garden
.
-RRB-
He
told
Gilberte
that
*NL*
she
might
play
one
game
;
he
could
wait
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
,
*NL*
sitting
down
,
just
like
anyone
else
,
on
an
iron
chair
,
paid
for
his
*NL*
ticket
with
that
hand
which
Philippe
VII
had
so
often
held
in
his
own
,
*NL*
while
we
began
our
game
upon
the
lawn
,
scattering
the
pigeons
,
whose
*NL*
beautiful
,
iridescent
bodies
-LRB-
shaped
like
hearts
and
,
surely
,
the
lilacs
*NL*
of
the
feathered
kingdom
-RRB-
took
refuge
as
in
so
many
sanctuaries
,
one
on
*NL*
the
great
basin
of
stone
,
on
which
its
beak
,
as
it
disappeared
below
the
*NL*
rim
,
conferred
the
part
,
assigned
the
purpose
of
offering
to
the
bird
in
*NL*
abundance
the
fruit
or
grain
at
which
it
appeared
to
be
pecking
,
another
*NL*
on
the
head
of
the
statue
,
which
it
seemed
to
crown
with
one
of
those
*NL*
enamelled
objects
whose
polychrome
varies
in
certain
classical
works
*NL*
the
monotony
of
the
stone
,
and
with
an
attribute
which
,
when
the
goddess
*NL*
bears
it
,
entitles
her
to
a
particular
epithet
and
makes
of
her
,
as
a
*NL*
different
Christian
name
makes
of
a
mortal
,
a
fresh
divinity
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
these
sunny
days
which
had
not
realised
my
hopes
,
I
had
not
*NL*
the
courage
to
conceal
my
disappointment
from
Gilberte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
ever
so
many
things
to
ask
you
,
''
I
said
to
her
;
``
I
thought
that
*NL*
to-day
was
going
to
mean
so
much
in
our
friendship
.
And
no
sooner
have
*NL*
you
come
than
you
go
away
!
Try
to
come
early
to-morrow
,
so
that
I
can
*NL*
talk
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
lighted
up
and
she
jumped
for
joy
as
she
answered
:
``
Tomorrow
,
*NL*
you
may
make
up
your
mind
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
sha
'n'
t
come
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
of
all
I
've
a
big
luncheon-party
;
then
in
the
afternoon
I
*NL*
am
going
to
a
friend
's
house
to
see
King
Theodosius
arrive
from
her
*NL*
windows
;
wo
n't
that
be
splendid
?
--
and
then
,
next
day
,
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
_
Michel
Strogoff
_
,
and
after
that
it
will
soon
be
Christmas
,
and
the
New
*NL*
Year
holidays
!
Perhaps
they
'll
take
me
south
,
to
the
Riviera
;
wo
n't
that
*NL*
be
nice
?
Though
I
should
miss
the
Christmas-tree
here
;
anyhow
,
if
I
do
*NL*
stay
in
Paris
,
I
sha
'n'

because
I
shall
be
out
paying
*NL*
calls
with
Mamma
.
Good-bye

there
's
Papa
calling
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
home
with
Fran√ßoise
through
streets
that
were
still
gay
with
*NL*
sunshine
,
as
on
the
evening
of
a
holiday
when
the
merriment
is
over
.
I
*NL*
could
scarcely
drag
my
legs
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
surprised
;
''
said
Fran√ßoise
,
``
it
's
not
the
right
weather
for
the
*NL*
time
of
year
;
it
's
much
too
warm
.
Oh
dear
,
oh
dear
,
to
think
of
all
*NL*
the
poor
sick
people
there
must
be
everywhere
;
you
would
think
that
up
*NL*
there
,
too
,
everything
's
got
out
of
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
repeated
to
myself
,
stifling
my
sobs
,
the
words
in
which
Gilberte
had
*NL*
given
utterance
to
her
joy
at
the
prospect
of
not
coming
back
,
for
a
*NL*
long
time
,
to
the
Champs-Elys√©es
.
But
already
the
charm
with
which
,
by
*NL*
the
mere
act
of
thinking
,
my
mind
was
filled
as
soon
as
it
thought
of
*NL*
her
,
the
privileged
position
,
unique
even
if
it
were
painful
,
in
which
*NL*
I
was
inevitably
placed
in
relation
to
Gilberte
by
the
contraction
of
a
*NL*
scar
in
my
mind
,
had
begun
to
add
to
that
very
mark
of
her
indifference
*NL*
something
romantic
,
and
in
the
midst
of
my
tears
my
lips
would
shape
*NL*
themselves
in
a
smile
which
was
indeed
the
timid
outline
of
a
kiss
.
And
*NL*
when
the
time
came
for
the
postman
I
said
to
myself
,
that
evening
as
on
*NL*
every
other
:
``
I
am
going
to
have
a
letter
from
Gilberte
,
she
is
going
to
*NL*
tell
me
,
at
last
,
that
she
has
never
ceased
to
love
me
,
and
to
explain
*NL*
to
me
the
mysterious
reason
by
which
she
has
been
forced
to
conceal
her
*NL*
love
from
me
until
now
,
to
put
on
the
appearance
of
being
able
to
be
*NL*
happy
without
seeing
me
;
the
reason
for
which
she
has
assumed
the
form
*NL*
of
the
other
Gilberte
,
who
is
simply
a
companion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
evening
I
would
beguile
myself
into
imagining
this
letter
,
*NL*
believing
that
I
was
actually
reading
it
,
reciting
each
of
its
sentences
*NL*
in
turn
.
Suddenly
I
would
stop
,
in
alarm
.
I
had
realised
that
,
if
I
was
*NL*
to
receive
a
letter
from
Gilberte
,
it
could
not
,
in
any
case
,
be
this
*NL*
letter
,
since
it
was
I
myself
who
had
just
composed
it
.
And
from
that
*NL*
moment
I
would
strive
to
keep
my
thoughts
clear
of
the
words
which
I
*NL*
should
have
liked
her
to
write
to
me
,
from
fear
lest
,
by
first
selecting
*NL*
them
myself
,
I
should
be
excluding
just
those
identical
words
,
--
the
*NL*
dearest
,
the
most
desired
--
from
the
field
of
possible
events
.
Even
if
,
*NL*
by
an
almost
impossible
coincidence
,
it
had
been
precisely
the
letter
*NL*
of
my
invention
that
Gilberte
had
addressed
to
me
of
her
own
accord
,
*NL*
recognising
my
own
work
in
it
I
should
not
have
had
the
impression
that
*NL*
I
was
receiving
something
that
had
not
originated
in
myself
,
something
*NL*
real
,
something
new
,
a
happiness
external
to
my
mind
,
independent
of
my
*NL*
will
,
a
gift
indeed
from
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
waited
I
read
over
again
a
page
which
,
although
it
had
not
been
*NL*
written
to
me
by
Gilberte
,
came
to
me
,
none
the
less
,
from
her
,
that
*NL*
page
by
Bergotte
upon
the
beauty
of
the
old
myths
from
which
Racine
*NL*
drew
his
inspiration
,
which
-LRB-
with
the
agate
marble
-RRB-
I
always
kept
within
*NL*
reach
.
I
was
touched
by
my
friend
's
kindness
in
having
procured
the
book
*NL*
for
me
;
and
as
everyone
is
obliged
to
find
some
reason
for
his
passion
,
*NL*
so
much
so
that
he
is
glad
to
find
in
the
creature
whom
he
loves
*NL*
qualities
which
-LRB-
he
has
learned
by
reading
or
in
conversation
-RRB-
are
*NL*
worthy
to
excite
a
man
's
love
,
that
he
assimilates
them
by
imitation
*NL*
and
makes
out
of
them
fresh
reasons
for
his
love
,
even
although
these
*NL*
qualities
be
diametrically
opposed
to
those
for
which
his
love
would
*NL*
have
sought
,
so
long
as
it
was
spontaneous
--
as
Swann
,
before
my
day
,
had
*NL*
sought
to
establish
the
aesthetic
basis
of
Odette
's
beauty
--
I
,
who
had
*NL*
at
first
loved
Gilberte
,
in
Combray
days
,
on
account
of
all
the
unknown
*NL*
element
in
her
life
into
which
I
would
fain
have
plunged
headlong
,
have
*NL*
undergone
reincarnation
,
discarding
my
own
separate
existence
as
a
thing
*NL*
that
no
longer
mattered
,
I
thought
now
,
as
of
an
inestimable
advantage
,
*NL*
that
of
this
,
my
own
,
my
too
familiar
,
my
contemptible
existence
*NL*
Gilberte
might
one
day
become
the
humble
servant
,
the
kindly
,
the
*NL*
comforting
collaborator
,
who
in
the
evenings
,
helping
me
in
my
work
,
*NL*
would
collate
for
me
the
texts
of
rare
pamphlets
.
As
for
Bergotte
,
that
*NL*
infinitely
wise
,
almost
divine
old
man
,
because
of
whom
I
had
first
,
*NL*
before
I
had
even
seen
her
,
loved
Gilberte
,
now
it
was
for
Gilberte
's
*NL*
sake
,
chiefly
,
that
I
loved
him
.
With
as
much
pleasure
as
the
pages
that
*NL*
he
had
written
about
Racine
,
I
studied
the
wrapper
,
folded
under
great
*NL*
seals
of
white
wax
and
tied
with
billows
of
pink
ribbon
,
in
which
she
*NL*
had
brought
those
pages
to
me
.
I
kissed
the
agate
marble
,
which
was
*NL*
the
better
part
of
my
love
's
heart
,
the
part
that
was
not
frivolous
but
*NL*
faithful
,
and
,
for
all
that
it
was
adorned
with
the
mysterious
charm
of
*NL*
Gilberte
's
life
,
dwelt
close
beside
me
,
inhabited
my
chamber
,
shared
my
*NL*
bed
.
But
the
beauty
of
that
stone
,
and
the
beauty
also
of
those
pages
*NL*
of
Bergotte
which
I
was
glad
to
associate
with
the
idea
of
my
love
for
*NL*
Gilberte
,
as
if
,
in
the
moments
when
my
love
seemed
no
longer
to
have
*NL*
any
existence
,
they
gave
it
a
kind
of
consistency
,
were
,
I
perceived
,
*NL*
anterior
to
that
love
,
which
they
in
no
way
resembled
;
their
elements
*NL*
had
been
determined
by
the
writer
's
talent
,
or
by
geological
laws
,
*NL*
before
ever
Gilberte
had
known
me
,
nothing
in
book
or
stone
would
have
*NL*
been
different
if
Gilberte
had
not
loved
me
,
and
there
was
nothing
,
*NL*
consequently
,
that
authorised
me
to
read
in
them
a
message
of
happiness
.
*NL*
And
while
my
love
,
incessantly
waiting
for
the
morrow
to
bring
a
*NL*
confession
of
Gilberte
's
love
for
me
,
destroyed
,
unravelled
every
*NL*
evening
,
the
ill-done
work
of
the
day
,
in
some
shadowed
part
of
my
being
*NL*
was
an
unknown
weaver
who
would
not
leave
where
they
lay
the
severed
*NL*
threads
,
but
collected
and
rearranged
them
,
without
any
thought
of
*NL*
pleasing
me
,
or
of
toiling
for
my
advantage
,
in
the
different
order
*NL*
which
she
gave
to
all
her
handiwork
.
Without
any
special
interest
in
my
*NL*
love
,
not
beginning
by
deciding
that
I
was
loved
,
she
placed
,
side
by
*NL*
side
,
those
of
Gilberte
's
actions
that
had
seemed
to
me
inexplicable
and
*NL*
her
faults
which
I
had
excused
.
Then
,
one
with
another
,
they
took
on
*NL*
a
meaning
.
It
seemed
to
tell
me
,
this
new
arrangement
,
that
when
I
saw
*NL*
Gilberte
,
instead
of
coming
to
me
in
the
Champs-Elys√©es
,
going
to
a
*NL*
party
,
or
on
errands
with
her
governess
,
when
I
saw
her
prepared
for
*NL*
an
absence
that
would
extend
over
the
New
Year
holidays
,
I
was
wrong
in
*NL*
thinking
,
in
saying
:
``
It
is
because
she
is
frivolous
,
''
or
``
easily
lead
.
''
*NL*
For
she
would
have
ceased
to
be
either
if
she
had
loved
me
,
and
if
she
*NL*
had
been
forced
to
obey
it
would
have
been
with
the
same
despair
in
*NL*
her
heart
that
I
felt
on
the
days
when
I
did
not
see
her
.
It
shewed
me
*NL*
further
,
this
new
arrangement
,
that
I
ought
,
after
all
,
to
know
what
*NL*
it
was
to
love
,
since
I
loved
Gilberte
;
it
drew
my
attention
to
the
*NL*
constant
anxiety
that
I
had
to
`
shew
off
'
before
her
,
by
reason
of
which
*NL*
I
tried
to
persuade
my
mother
to
get
for
Fran√ßoise
a
waterproof
coat
and
*NL*
a
hat
with
a
blue
feather
,
or
,
better
still
,
to
stop
sending
with
me
to
*NL*
the
Champs-Elys√©es
an
attendant
with
whom
I
blushed
to
be
seen
-LRB-
to
all
*NL*
of
which
my
mother
replied
that
I
was
not
fair
to
Fran√ßoise
,
that
*NL*
she
was
an
excellent
woman
and
devoted
to
us
all
-RRB-
and
also
that
sole
,
*NL*
exclusive
need
to
see
Gilberte
,
the
result
of
which
was
that
,
months
in
*NL*
advance
,
I
could
think
of
nothing
but
how
to
find
out
at
what
date
she
*NL*
would
be
leaving
Paris
and
where
she
was
going
,
feeling
that
the
most
*NL*
attractive
country
in
the
world
would
be
but
a
place
of
exile
if
she
*NL*
were
not
to
be
there
,
and
asking
only
to
be
allowed
to
stay
for
ever
*NL*
in
Paris
,
so
long
as
I
might
see
her
in
the
Champs-Elys√©es
;
and
it
had
*NL*
little
difficulty
in
making
me
see
that
neither
my
anxiety
nor
my
*NL*
need
could
be
justified
by
anything
in
Gilberte
's
conduct
.
She
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
was
genuinely
fond
of
her
governess
,
without
troubling
herself
*NL*
over
what
I
might
choose
to
think
about
it
.
It
seemed
quite
natural
to
*NL*
her
not
to
come
to
the
Champs-Elys√©es
if
she
had
to
go
shopping
with
*NL*
Mademoiselle
,
delightful
if
she
had
to
go
out
somewhere
with
her
mother
.
*NL*
And
even
supposing
that
she
would
ever
have
allowed
me
to
spend
my
*NL*
holidays
in
the
same
place
as
herself
,
when
it
came
to
choosing
*NL*
that
place
she
considered
her
parents
'
wishes
,
a
thousand
different
*NL*
amusements
of
which
she
had
been
told
,
and
not
at
all
that
it
should
be
*NL*
the
place
to
which
my
family
were
proposing
to
send
me
.
When
she
assured
*NL*
me
-LRB-
as
sometimes
happened
-RRB-
that
she
liked
me
less
than
some
other
of
*NL*
her
friends
,
less
than
she
had
liked
me
the
day
before
,
because
by
my
*NL*
clumsiness
I
had
made
her
side
lose
a
game
,
I
would
beg
her
pardon
,
I
*NL*
would
beg
her
to
tell
me
what
I
must
do
in
order
that
she
should
begin
*NL*
again
to
like
me
as
much
as
,
or
more
than
the
rest
;
I
hoped
to
hear
her
*NL*
say
that
that
was
already
my
position
;
I
besought
her
;
as
though
she
had
*NL*
been
able
to
modify
her
affection
for
me
as
she
or
I
chose
,
to
give
me
*NL*
pleasure
,
merely
by
the
words
that
she
would
utter
,
as
my
good
or
bad
*NL*
conduct
should
deserve
.
Was
I
,
then
,
not
yet
aware
that
what
I
felt
,
*NL*
myself
,
for
her
,
depended
neither
upon
her
actions
nor
upon
my
desires
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
shewed
me
finally
,
the
new
arrangement
planned
by
my
unseen
weaver
,
*NL*
that
,
if
we
find
ourselves
hoping
that
the
actions
of
a
person
who
has
*NL*
hitherto
caused
us
anxiety
may
prove
not
to
have
been
sincere
,
they
shed
*NL*
in
their
wake
a
light
which
our
hopes
are
powerless
to
extinguish
,
a
*NL*
light
to
which
,
rather
than
to
our
hopes
,
we
must
put
the
question
,
what
*NL*
will
be
that
person
's
actions
on
the
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
new
counsels
,
my
love
listened
and
heard
them
;
they
persuaded
it
*NL*
that
the
morrow
would
not
be
different
from
all
the
days
that
had
gone
*NL*
before
;
that
Gilberte
's
feeling
for
me
,
too
long
established
now
to
*NL*
be
capable
of
alteration
,
was
indifference
;
that
in
my
friendship
with
*NL*
Gilberte
,
it
was
I
alone
who
loved
.
``
That
is
true
,
''
my
love
responded
,
*NL*
``
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
made
of
that
friendship
.
It
will
not
alter
*NL*
now
.
''
And
so
the
very
next
day
-LRB-
unless
I
were
to
wait
for
a
public
*NL*
holiday
,
if
there
was
one
approaching
,
some
anniversary
,
the
New
Year
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
one
of
those
days
which
are
not
like
other
days
,
on
which
time
*NL*
starts
afresh
,
casting
aside
the
heritage
of
the
past
,
declining
its
*NL*
legacy
of
sorrows
-RRB-
I
would
appeal
to
Gilberte
to
terminate
our
old
and
*NL*
to
join
me
in
laying
the
foundations
of
a
new
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
always
,
within
reach
,
a
plan
of
Paris
,
which
,
because
I
could
see
*NL*
drawn
on
it
the
street
in
which
M.
and
Mme.
Swann
lived
,
seemed
to
me
to
*NL*
contain
a
secret
treasure
.
And
to
please
myself
,
as
well
as
by
a
sort
*NL*
of
chivalrous
loyalty
,
in
any
connection
or
with
no
relevance
at
all
,
I
*NL*
would
repeat
the
name
of
that
street
until
my
father
,
not
being
,
like
*NL*
my
mother
and
grandmother
,
in
the
secret
of
my
love
,
would
ask
:
``
But
*NL*
why
are
you
always
talking
about
that
street
?
There
's
nothing
wonderful
*NL*
about
it
.
It
is
an
admirable
street
to
live
in
because
it
's
only
a
few
*NL*
minutes
'
walk
from
the
Bois
,
but
there
are
a
dozen
other
streets
just
*NL*
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
every
effort
to
introduce
the
name
of
Swann
into
my
conversation
*NL*
with
my
parents
;
in
my
own
mind
,
of
course
,
I
never
ceased
to
murmur
it
;
*NL*
but
I
needed
also
to
hear
its
exquisite
sound
,
and
to
make
myself
*NL*
play
that
chord
,
the
voiceless
rendering
of
which
did
not
suffice
*NL*
me
.
Moreover
,
that
name
of
Swann
,
with
which
I
had
for
so
long
been
*NL*
familiar
,
was
to
me
now
-LRB-
as
happens
at
times
to
people
suffering
from
*NL*
aphasia
,
in
the
case
of
the
most
ordinary
words
-RRB-
the
name
of
something
*NL*
new
.
It
was
for
ever
present
in
my
mind
,
which
could
not
,
however
,
grow
*NL*
accustomed
to
it
.
I
analysed
it
,
I
spelt
it
;
its
orthography
came
to
me
*NL*
as
a
surprise
.
And
with
its
familiarity
it
had
simultaneously
lost
its
*NL*
innocence
.
The
pleasure
that
I
derived
from
the
sound
of
it
I
felt
to
*NL*
be
so
guilty
,
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
others
must
read
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
would
change
the
conversation
if
I
endeavoured
to
guide
it
*NL*
in
that
direction
.
I
fell
back
upon
subjects
which
still
brought
me
into
*NL*
touch
with
Gilberte
,
I
eternally
repeated
the
same
words
,
and
it
was
no
*NL*
use
my
knowing
that
they
were
but
words
--
words
uttered
in
her
absence
,
*NL*
which
she
could
not
hear
,
words
without
virtue
in
themselves
,
repeating
*NL*
what
were
,
indeed
,
facts
,
but
powerless
to
modify
them
--
for
still
*NL*
it
seemed
to
me
that
by
dint
of
handling
,
of
stirring
in
this
way
*NL*
everything
that
had
reference
to
Gilberte
,
I
might
perhaps
make
emerge
*NL*
from
it
something
that
would
bring
me
happiness
.
I
told
my
parents
again
*NL*
that
Gilberte
was
very
fond
of
her
governess
,
as
if
the
statement
,
when
*NL*
repeated
for
the
hundredth
time
,
would
at
last
have
the
effect
of
making
*NL*
Gilberte
suddenly
burst
into
the
room
,
come
to
live
with
us
for
ever
.
*NL*
I
had
already
sung
the
praises
of
the
old
lady
who
read
the
_
D√©bats
_
*NL*
-LRB-
I
had
hinted
to
my
parents
that
she
must
at
least
be
an
Ambassador
's
*NL*
widow
,
if
not
actually
a
Highness
-RRB-
and
I
continued
to
descant
on
her
*NL*
beauty
,
her
splendour
,
her
nobility
,
until
the
day
on
which
I
mentioned
*NL*
that
,
by
what
I
had
heard
Gilberte
call
her
,
she
appeared
to
be
a
Mme.
*NL*
Blatin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
now
I
know
whom
you
mean
,
''
cried
my
mother
,
while
I
felt
myself
*NL*
grow
red
all
over
with
shame
.
``
On
guard
!
on
guard
!
--
as
your
grandfather
*NL*
says
.
And
so
it
's
she
that
you
think
so
wonderful
?
Why
,
she
's
perfectly
*NL*
horrible
,
and
always
has
been
.
She
's
the
widow
of
a
bailiff
.
You
ca
n't
*NL*
remember
,
when
you
were
little
,
all
the
trouble
I
used
to
have
to
avoid
*NL*
her
at
your
gymnastic
lessons
,
where
she
was
always
trying
to
get
hold
*NL*
of
me
--
I
did
n't
know
the
woman
,
of
course
--
to
tell
me
that
you
were
*NL*
`
much
too
nice-looking
for
a
boy
.
'
She
has
always
had
an
insane
desire
*NL*
to
get
to
know
people
,
and
she
must
be
quite
insane
,
as
I
have
always
*NL*
thought
,
if
she
really
does
know
Mme.
Swann
.
For
even
if
she
does
come
*NL*
of
very
common
people
,
I
have
never
heard
anything
said
against
her
*NL*
character
.
But
she
must
always
be
forcing
herself
upon
strangers
.
She
*NL*
is
,
really
,
a
horrible
woman
,
frightfully
vulgar
,
and
besides
,
she
is
*NL*
always
creating
awkward
situations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Swann
,
in
my
attempts
to
resemble
him
,
I
spent
the
whole
time
,
*NL*
when
I
was
at
table
,
in
drawing
my
finger
along
my
nose
and
in
rubbing
*NL*
my
eyes
.
My
father
would
exclaim
:
``
The
child
's
a
perfect
idiot
,
he
's
*NL*
becoming
quite
impossible
.
''
More
than
all
else
I
should
have
liked
to
*NL*
be
as
bald
as
Swann
.
He
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
creature
so
extraordinary
*NL*
that
I
found
it
impossible
to
believe
that
people
whom
I
knew
and
often
*NL*
saw
knew
him
also
,
and
that
in
the
course
of
the
day
anyone
might
run
*NL*
against
him
.
And
once
my
mother
,
while
she
was
telling
us
,
as
she
did
*NL*
every
evening
at
dinner
,
where
she
had
been
and
what
she
had
done
that
*NL*
afternoon
,
merely
by
the
words
:
``
By
the
way
,
guess
whom
I
saw
at
the
*NL*
Trois
Quartiers
--
at
the
umbrella
counter
--
Swann
!
''
caused
to
burst
open
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
her
narrative
-LRB-
an
arid
desert
to
me
-RRB-
a
mystic
blossom
.
*NL*
What
a
melancholy
satisfaction
to
learn
that
,
that
very
afternoon
,
*NL*
threading
through
the
crowd
his
supernatural
form
,
Swann
had
gone
to
*NL*
buy
an
umbrella
.
Among
the
events
of
the
day
,
great
and
small
,
but
*NL*
all
equally
unimportant
,
that
one
alone
aroused
in
me
those
peculiar
*NL*
vibrations
by
which
my
love
for
Gilberte
was
invariably
stirred
.
My
*NL*
father
complained
that
I
took
no
interest
in
anything
,
because
I
did
not
*NL*
listen
while
he
was
speaking
of
the
political
developments
that
might
*NL*
follow
the
visit
of
King
Theodosius
,
at
that
moment
in
France
as
*NL*
the
nation
's
guest
and
-LRB-
it
was
hinted
-RRB-
ally
.
And
yet
how
intensely
*NL*
interested
I
was
to
know
whether
Swann
had
been
wearing
his
hooded
cape
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
speak
to
him
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
I
did
,
''
answered
my
mother
,
who
always
seemed
afraid
*NL*
lest
,
were
she
to
admit
that
we
were
not
on
the
warmest
of
terms
with
*NL*
Swann
,
people
would
seek
to
reconcile
us
more
than
she
cared
for
,
in
*NL*
view
of
the
existence
of
Mme.
Swann
,
whom
she
did
not
wish
to
know
.
``
It
*NL*
was
he
who
came
up
and
spoke
to
me
.
I
had
n't
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
n't
quarrelled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quarrelled
?
What
on
earth
made
you
think
that
we
had
quarrelled
?
''
*NL*
she
briskly
parried
,
as
though
I
had
cast
doubt
on
the
fiction
of
her
*NL*
friendly
relations
with
Swann
,
and
was
planning
an
attempt
to
`
bring
*NL*
them
together
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
might
be
cross
with
you
for
never
asking
him
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
is
n't
obliged
to
ask
everyone
to
one
's
house
,
you
know
;
has
he
ever
*NL*
asked
me
to
his
?
I
do
n't
know
his
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
used
often
to
come
,
at
Combray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
he
did
!
He
used
to
come
at
Combray
,
and
now
,
in
Paris
,
*NL*
he
has
something
better
to
do
,
and
so
have
I
.
But
I
can
promise
you
,
we
*NL*
did
n't
look
in
the
least
like
people
who
had
quarrelled
.
We
were
kept
*NL*
waiting
there
for
some
time
,
while
they
brought
him
his
parcel
.
He
*NL*
asked
after
you
;
he
told
me
you
had
been
playing
with
his
daughter
--
''
*NL*
my
mother
went
on
,
amazing
me
with
the
portentous
revelation
of
my
own
*NL*
existence
in
Swann
's
mind
;
far
more
than
that
,
of
my
existence
in
so
*NL*
complete
,
so
material
a
form
that
when
I
stood
before
him
,
trembling
*NL*
with
love
,
in
the
Champs-Elys√©es
,
he
had
known
my
name
,
and
who
my
*NL*
mother
was
,
and
had
been
able
to
blend
with
my
quality
as
his
daughter
's
*NL*
playmate
certain
facts
with
regard
to
my
grandparents
and
their
*NL*
connections
,
the
place
in
which
we
lived
,
certain
details
of
our
past
*NL*
life
,
all
of
which
I
myself
perhaps
did
not
know
.
But
my
mother
did
not
*NL*
seem
to
have
noticed
anything
particularly
attractive
in
that
counter
at
*NL*
the
Trois
Quartiers
where
she
had
represented
to
Swann
,
at
the
moment
*NL*
in
which
he
caught
sight
of
her
,
a
definite
person
with
whom
he
had
*NL*
sufficient
memories
in
common
to
impel
him
to
come
up
to
her
and
to
*NL*
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
either
she
or
my
father
seem
to
find
any
occasion
now
to
mention
*NL*
Swann
's
family
,
the
grandparents
of
Gilberte
,
nor
to
use
the
title
of
*NL*
stockbroker
,
topics
than
which
nothing
else
gave
me
so
keen
a
pleasure
.
*NL*
My
imagination
had
isolated
and
consecrated
in
the
social
Paris
a
*NL*
certain
family
,
just
as
it
had
set
apart
in
the
structural
Paris
a
*NL*
certain
house
,
on
whose
porch
it
had
fashioned
sculptures
and
made
its
*NL*
windows
precious
.
But
these
ornaments
I
alone
had
eyes
to
see
.
Just
as
*NL*
my
father
and
mother
looked
upon
the
house
in
which
Swann
lived
as
one
*NL*
that
closely
resembled
the
other
houses
built
at
the
same
period
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
the
Bois
,
so
Swann
's
family
seemed
to
them
to
be
in
the
*NL*
same
category
as
many
other
families
of
stockbrokers
.
Their
judgment
was
*NL*
more
or
less
favourable
according
to
the
extent
to
which
the
family
in
*NL*
question
shared
in
merits
that
were
common
to
the
rest
of
the
universe
,
*NL*
and
there
was
about
it
nothing
that
they
could
call
unique
.
What
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
they
did
appreciate
in
the
Swanns
they
found
in
equal
,
if
*NL*
not
in
greater
measure
elsewhere
.
And
so
,
after
admitting
that
the
house
*NL*
was
in
a
good
position
,
they
would
go
on
to
speak
of
some
other
house
*NL*
that
was
in
a
better
,
but
had
nothing
to
do
with
Gilberte
,
or
of
*NL*
financiers
on
a
larger
scale
than
her
grandfather
had
been
;
and
if
they
*NL*
had
appeared
,
for
a
moment
,
to
be
of
my
opinion
,
that
was
a
mistake
*NL*
which
was
very
soon
corrected
.
For
in
order
to
distinguish
in
all
*NL*
Gilberte
's
surroundings
an
indefinable
quality
analogous
,
in
the
scale
*NL*
of
emotions
,
to
what
in
the
scale
of
colours
is
called
infra-red
,
a
*NL*
supplementary
sense
of
perception
was
required
,
with
which
love
,
for
the
*NL*
time
being
,
had
endowed
me
;
and
this
my
parents
lacked
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
days
when
Gilberte
had
warned
me
that
she
would
not
be
coming
to
*NL*
the
Champs-Elys√©es
,
I
would
try
to
arrange
my
walks
so
that
I
should
*NL*
be
brought
into
some
kind
of
contact
with
her
.
Sometimes
I
would
lead
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
house
in
which
the
Swanns
lived
,
making
*NL*
her
repeat
to
me
unendingly
all
that
she
had
learned
from
the
governess
*NL*
with
regard
to
Mme.
Swann
.
``
It
seems
,
she
puts
great
faith
in
medals
.
*NL*
She
would
never
think
of
starting
on
a
journey
if
she
had
heard
an
*NL*
owl
hoot
,
or
the
death-watch
in
the
wall
,
or
if
she
had
seen
a
cat
*NL*
at
midnight
,
or
if
the
furniture
had
creaked
.
Oh
yes
!
she
's
a
most
*NL*
religious
lady
,
she
is
!
''
I
was
so
madly
in
love
with
Gilberte
that
if
,
*NL*
on
our
way
,
I
caught
sight
of
their
old
butler
taking
the
dog
out
,
my
*NL*
emotion
would
bring
me
to
a
standstill
,
I
would
fasten
on
his
white
*NL*
whiskers
eyes
that
melted
with
passion
.
And
Fran√ßoise
would
rouse
me
*NL*
with
:
``
What
's
wrong
with
you
now
,
child
?
''
and
we
would
continue
on
our
*NL*
way
until
we
reached
their
gate
,
where
a
porter
,
different
from
every
*NL*
other
porter
in
the
world
,
and
saturated
,
even
to
the
braid
on
his
*NL*
livery
,
with
the
same
melancholy
charm
that
I
had
felt
to
be
latent
in
*NL*
the
name
of
Gilberte
,
looked
at
me
as
though
he
knew
that
I
was
one
*NL*
of
those
whose
natural
unworthiness
would
for
ever
prevent
them
from
*NL*
penetrating
into
the
mysteries
of
the
life
inside
,
which
it
was
his
duty
*NL*
to
guard
,
and
over
which
the
ground-floor
windows
appeared
conscious
of
*NL*
being
protectingly
closed
,
with
far
less
resemblance
,
between
the
nobly
*NL*
sweeping
arches
of
their
muslin
curtains
,
to
any
other
windows
in
the
*NL*
world
than
to
Gilberte
's
glancing
eyes
.
On
other
days
we
would
go
along
*NL*
the
boulevards
,
and
I
would
post
myself
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Duphot
;
*NL*
I
had
heard
that
Swann
was
often
to
be
seen
passing
there
,
on
his
way
*NL*
to
the
dentist
's
;
and
my
imagination
so
far
differentiated
Gilberte
's
*NL*
father
from
the
rest
of
humanity
,
his
presence
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
*NL*
of
real
people
introduced
among
them
so
miraculous
an
element
,
that
even
*NL*
before
we
reached
the
Madeleine
I
would
be
trembling
with
emotion
at
*NL*
the
thought
that
I
was
approaching
a
street
from
which
that
supernatural
*NL*
apparition
might
at
any
moment
burst
upon
me
unawares
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
most
often
of
all
,
on
days
when
I
was
not
to
see
Gilberte
,
as
I
*NL*
had
heard
that
Mme.
Swann
walked
almost
every
day
along
the
All√©e
des
*NL*
Acacias
,
round
the
big
lake
,
and
in
the
All√©e
de
la
Reine
Marguerite
,
I
*NL*
would
guide
Fran√ßoise
in
the
direction
of
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
It
was
*NL*
to
me
like
one
of
those
zoological
gardens
in
which
one
sees
assembled
*NL*
together
a
variety
of
flora
,
and
contrasted
effects
in
landscape
;
where
*NL*
from
a
hill
one
passes
to
a
grotto
,
a
meadow
,
rocks
,
a
stream
,
a
trench
,
*NL*
another
hill
,
a
marsh
,
but
knows
that
they
are
there
only
to
enable
*NL*
the
hippopotamus
,
zebra
,
crocodile
,
rabbit
,
bear
and
heron
to
disport
*NL*
themselves
in
a
natural
or
a
picturesque
setting
;
this
,
the
Bois
,
*NL*
equally
complex
,
uniting
a
multitude
of
little
worlds
,
distinct
and
*NL*
separate
--
placing
a
stage
set
with
red
trees
,
American
oaks
,
like
an
*NL*
experimental
forest
in
Virginia
,
next
to
a
fir-wood
by
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
lake
,
or
to
a
forest
grove
from
which
would
suddenly
emerge
,
in
her
*NL*
lissom
covering
of
furs
,
with
the
large
,
appealing
eyes
of
a
dumb
*NL*
animal
,
a
hastening
walker
--
was
the
Garden
of
Woman
;
and
like
the
*NL*
myrtle-alley
in
the
Aeneid
,
planted
for
their
delight
with
trees
of
one
*NL*
kind
only
,
the
All√©e
des
Acacias
was
thronged
by
the
famous
Beauties
*NL*
of
the
day
.
As
,
from
a
long
way
off
,
the
sight
of
the
jutting
crag
from
*NL*
which
it
dives
into
the
pool
thrills
with
joy
the
children
who
know
*NL*
that
they
are
going
to
behold
the
seal
,
long
before
I
reached
the
*NL*
acacia-alley
,
their
fragrance
,
scattered
abroad
,
would
make
me
feel
that
*NL*
I
was
approaching
the
incomparable
presence
of
a
vegetable
personality
,
*NL*
strong
and
tender
;
then
,
as
I
drew
near
,
the
sight
of
their
topmost
*NL*
branches
,
their
lightly
tossing
foliage
,
in
its
easy
grace
,
its
*NL*
coquettish
outline
,
its
delicate
fabric
,
over
which
hundreds
of
flowers
*NL*
were
laid
,
like
winged
and
throbbing
colonies
of
precious
insects
;
and
*NL*
finally
their
name
itself
,
feminine
,
indolent
and
seductive
,
made
my
*NL*
heart
beat
,
but
with
a
social
longing
,
like
those
waltzes
which
remind
*NL*
us
only
of
the
names
of
the
fair
dancers
,
called
aloud
as
they
entered
*NL*
the
ball-room
.
I
had
been
told
that
I
should
see
in
the
alley
certain
*NL*
women
of
fashion
,
who
,
in
spite
of
their
not
all
having
husbands
,
were
*NL*
constantly
mentioned
in
conjunction
with
Mme.
Swann
,
but
most
often
by
*NL*
their
professional
names
;
--
their
new
names
,
when
they
had
any
,
being
*NL*
but
a
sort
of
incognito
,
a
veil
which
those
who
would
speak
of
them
were
*NL*
careful
to
draw
aside
,
so
as
to
make
themselves
understood
.
Thinking
*NL*
that
Beauty
--
in
the
order
of
feminine
elegance
--
was
governed
by
occult
*NL*
laws
into
the
knowledge
of
which
they
had
been
initiated
,
and
that
they
*NL*
had
the
power
to
realise
it
,
I
accepted
before
seeing
them
,
like
the
*NL*
truth
of
a
coming
revelation
,
the
appearance
of
their
clothes
,
of
their
*NL*
carriages
and
horses
,
of
a
thousand
details
among
which
I
placed
my
*NL*
faith
as
in
an
inner
soul
which
gave
the
cohesion
of
a
work
of
art
to
*NL*
that
ephemeral
and
changing
pageant
.
But
it
was
Mme.
Swann
whom
I
wished
*NL*
to
see
,
and
I
waited
for
her
to
go
past
,
as
deeply
moved
as
though
*NL*
she
were
Gilberte
,
whose
parents
,
saturated
,
like
everything
in
her
*NL*
environment
,
with
her
own
special
charm
,
excited
in
me
as
keen
a
passion
*NL*
as
she
did
herself
,
indeed
a
still
more
painful
disturbance
-LRB-
since
their
*NL*
point
of
contact
with
her
was
that
intimate
,
that
internal
part
of
*NL*
her
life
which
was
hidden
from
me
-RRB-
,
and
furthermore
,
for
I
very
soon
*NL*
learned
,
as
we
shall
see
in
due
course
,
that
they
did
not
like
my
*NL*
playing
with
her
,
that
feeling
of
veneration
which
we
always
have
for
*NL*
those
who
hold
,
and
exercise
without
restraint
,
the
power
to
do
us
an
*NL*
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
assigned
the
first
place
,
in
the
order
of
aesthetic
merit
and
of
*NL*
social
grandeur
,
to
simplicity
,
when
I
saw
Mme.
Swann
on
foot
,
in
a
*NL*
`
polonaise
'
of
plain
cloth
,
a
little
toque
on
her
head
trimmed
with
a
*NL*
pheasant
's
wing
,
a
bunch
of
violets
in
her
bosom
,
hastening
along
the
*NL*
All√©e
des
Acacias
as
if
it
had
been
merely
the
shortest
way
back
to
her
*NL*
own
house
,
and
acknowledging
with
a
rapid
glance
the
courtesy
of
the
*NL*
gentlemen
in
carriages
,
who
,
recognising
her
figure
at
a
distance
,
were
*NL*
raising
their
hats
to
her
and
saying
to
one
another
that
there
was
never
*NL*
anyone
so
well
turned
out
as
she
.
But
instead
of
simplicity
it
was
to
*NL*
ostentation
that
I
must
assign
the
first
place
if
,
after
I
had
compelled
*NL*
Fran√ßoise
,
who
could
hold
out
no
longer
,
and
complained
that
her
legs
*NL*
were
`
giving
'
beneath
her
,
to
stroll
up
and
down
with
me
for
another
*NL*
hour
,
I
saw
at
length
,
emerging
from
the
Porte
Dauphine
,
figuring
for
*NL*
me
a
royal
dignity
,
the
passage
of
a
sovereign
,
an
impression
such
as
*NL*
no
real
Queen
has
ever
since
been
able
to
give
me
,
because
my
notion
of
*NL*
their
power
has
been
less
vague
,
and
more
founded
upon
experience
--
borne
*NL*
along
by
the
flight
of
a
pair
of
fiery
horses
,
slender
and
shapely
as
*NL*
one
sees
them
in
the
drawings
of
Constantin
Guys
,
carrying
on
its
box
an
*NL*
enormous
coachman
,
furred
like
a
cossack
,
and
by
his
side
a
diminutive
*NL*
groom
,
like
Toby
,
``
the
late
Beaudenord
's
tiger
,
''
I
saw
--
or
rather
I
*NL*
felt
its
outlines
engraved
upon
my
heart
by
a
clean
and
killing
stab
--
a
*NL*
matchless
victoria
,
built
rather
high
,
and
hinting
,
through
the
extreme
*NL*
modernity
of
its
appointments
,
at
the
forms
of
an
earlier
day
,
deep
down
*NL*
in
which
lay
negligently
back
Mme.
Swann
,
her
hair
,
now
quite
pale
with
*NL*
one
grey
lock
,
girt
with
a
narrow
band
of
flowers
,
usually
violets
,
from
*NL*
which
floated
down
long
veils
,
a
lilac
parasol
in
her
hand
,
on
her
lips
*NL*
an
ambiguous
smile
in
which
I
read
only
the
benign
condescension
*NL*
of
Majesty
,
though
it
was
pre-eminently
the
enticing
smile
of
the
*NL*
courtesan
,
which
she
graciously
bestowed
upon
the
men
who
bowed
to
her
.
*NL*
That
smile
was
,
in
reality
,
saying
to
one
:
``
Oh
yes
,
I
do
remember
,
quite
*NL*
well
;
it
was
wonderful
!
''
to
another
:
``
How
I
should
have
loved
to
!
We
*NL*
were
unfortunate
!
''
,
to
a
third
:
``
Yes
,
if
you
like
!
I
must
just
keep
in
*NL*
the
line
for
a
minute
,
then
as
soon
as
I
can
I
will
break
away
.
''
When
*NL*
strangers
passed
she
still
allowed
to
linger
about
her
lips
a
lazy
*NL*
smile
,
as
though
she
expected
or
remembered
some
friend
,
which
made
them
*NL*
say
:
``
What
a
lovely
woman
!
''
.
And
for
certain
men
only
she
had
a
sour
,
*NL*
strained
,
shy
,
cold
smile
which
meant
:
``
Yes
,
you
old
goat
,
I
know
*NL*
that
you
've
got
a
tongue
like
a
viper
,
that
you
ca
n't
keep
quiet
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
But
do
you
suppose
that
I
care
what
you
say
?
''
Coquelin
passed
,
*NL*
talking
,
in
a
group
of
listening
friends
,
and
with
a
sweeping
wave
of
*NL*
his
hand
bade
a
theatrical
good
day
to
the
people
in
the
carriages
.
But
*NL*
I
thought
only
of
Mme.
Swann
,
and
pretended
to
have
not
yet
seen
her
,
*NL*
for
I
knew
that
,
when
she
reached
the
pigeon-shooting
ground
,
she
would
*NL*
tell
her
coachman
to
`
break
away
'
and
to
stop
the
carriage
,
so
that
she
*NL*
might
come
back
on
foot
.
And
on
days
when
I
felt
that
I
had
the
courage
*NL*
to
pass
close
by
her
I
would
drag
Fran√ßoise
off
in
that
direction
;
until
*NL*
the
moment
came
when
I
saw
Mme.
Swann
,
letting
trail
behind
her
the
long
*NL*
train
of
her
lilac
skirt
,
dressed
,
as
the
populace
imagine
queens
to
be
*NL*
dressed
,
in
rich
attire
such
as
no
other
woman
might
wear
,
lowering
*NL*
her
eyes
now
and
then
to
study
the
handle
of
her
parasol
,
paying
scant
*NL*
attention
to
the
passers-by
,
as
though
the
important
thing
for
her
,
her
*NL*
one
object
in
being
there
,
was
to
take
exercise
,
without
thinking
that
*NL*
she
was
seen
,
and
that
every
head
was
turned
towards
her
.
Sometimes
,
*NL*
however
,
when
she
had
looked
back
to
call
her
dog
to
her
,
she
would
*NL*
cast
,
almost
imperceptibly
,
a
sweeping
glance
round
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
even
who
did
not
know
her
were
warned
by
something
exceptional
,
*NL*
something
beyond
the
normal
in
her
--
or
perhaps
by
a
telepathic
*NL*
suggestion
such
as
would
move
an
ignorant
audience
to
a
frenzy
of
*NL*
applause
when
Berma
was
`
sublime
'
--
that
she
must
be
some
one
well-known
.
*NL*
They
would
ask
one
another
,
``
Who
is
she
?
''
,
or
sometimes
would
*NL*
interrogate
a
passing
stranger
,
or
would
make
a
mental
note
of
how
she
*NL*
was
dressed
so
as
to
fix
her
identity
,
later
,
in
the
mind
of
a
friend
*NL*
better
informed
than
themselves
,
who
would
at
once
enlighten
them
.
*NL*
Another
pair
,
half-stopping
in
their
walk
,
would
exchange
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
who
that
is
?
Mme.
Swann
!
That
conveys
nothing
to
you
?
Odette
*NL*
de
Cr√©cy
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Odette
de
Cr√©cy
!
Why
,
I
thought
as
much
.
Those
great
,
sad
eyes
...
But
I
*NL*
say
,
you
know
,
she
ca
n't
be
as
young
as
she
was
once
,
eh
?
I
remember
,
I
*NL*
had
her
on
the
day
that
MacMahon
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
remind
her
of
it
,
if
I
were
you
.
She
is
now
Mme.
Swann
,
the
*NL*
wife
of
a
gentleman
in
the
Jockey
Club
,
a
friend
of
the
Prince
of
Wales
.
*NL*
Apart
from
that
,
though
,
she
is
wonderful
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
you
ought
to
have
known
her
then
;
Gad
,
she
was
lovely
!
*NL*
She
lived
in
a
very
odd
little
house
with
a
lot
of
Chinese
stuff
.
*NL*
I
remember
,
we
were
bothered
all
the
time
by
the
newsboys
,
shouting
*NL*
outside
;
in
the
end
she
made
me
get
up
and
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
listening
to
these
memories
,
I
could
feel
all
about
her
the
*NL*
indistinct
murmur
of
fame
.
My
heart
leaped
with
impatience
when
I
*NL*
thought
that
a
few
seconds
must
still
elapse
before
all
these
people
,
*NL*
among
whom
I
was
dismayed
not
to
find
a
certain
mulatto
banker
who
-LRB-
or
*NL*
so
I
felt
-RRB-
had
a
contempt
for
me
,
were
to
see
the
unknown
youth
,
to
*NL*
whom
they
had
not
,
so
far
,
been
paying
the
slightest
attention
,
salute
*NL*
-LRB-
without
knowing
her
,
it
was
true
,
but
I
thought
that
I
had
sufficient
*NL*
authority
since
my
parents
knew
her
husband
and
I
was
her
daughter
's
*NL*
playmate
-RRB-
this
woman
whose
reputation
for
beauty
,
for
misconduct
,
and
*NL*
for
elegance
was
universal
.
But
I
was
now
close
to
Mme.
Swann
;
I
pulled
*NL*
off
my
hat
with
so
lavish
,
so
prolonged
a
gesture
that
she
could
not
*NL*
repress
a
smile
.
People
laughed
.
As
for
her
,
she
had
never
seen
me
with
*NL*
Gilberte
,
she
did
not
know
my
name
,
but
I
was
for
her
--
like
one
of
the
*NL*
keepers
in
the
Bois
,
like
the
boatman
,
or
the
ducks
on
the
lake
,
to
*NL*
which
she
threw
scraps
of
bread
--
one
of
the
minor
personages
,
familiar
,
*NL*
nameless
,
as
devoid
of
individual
character
as
a
stage-hand
in
a
*NL*
theatre
,
of
her
daily
walks
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
certain
days
when
I
had
missed
her
in
the
All√©e
des
Acacias
I
would
*NL*
be
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
her
in
the
All√©e
de
la
Reine
Marguerite
,
*NL*
where
women
went
who
wished
to
be
alone
,
or
to
appear
to
be
wishing
to
*NL*
be
alone
;
she
would
not
be
alone
for
long
,
being
soon
overtaken
by
some
*NL*
man
or
other
,
often
in
a
grey
'til
e
'
hat
,
whom
I
did
not
know
,
and
*NL*
who
would
talk
to
her
for
some
time
,
while
their
two
carriages
crawled
*NL*
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
That
sense
of
the
complexity
of
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
which
made
it
an
*NL*
artificial
place
and
,
in
the
zoological
or
mythological
sense
of
the
*NL*
word
,
a
Garden
,
I
captured
again
,
this
year
,
as
I
crossed
it
on
my
way
*NL*
to
Trianon
,
on
one
of
those
mornings
,
early
in
November
,
when
in
Paris
,
*NL*
if
we
stay
indoors
,
being
so
near
and
yet
prevented
from
witnessing
the
*NL*
transformation
scene
of
autumn
,
which
is
drawing
so
rapidly
to
a
close
*NL*
without
our
assistance
,
we
feel
a
regret
for
the
fallen
leaves
that
*NL*
becomes
a
fever
,
and
may
even
keep
us
awake
at
night
.
Into
my
closed
*NL*
room
they
had
been
drifting
already
for
a
month
,
summoned
there
by
*NL*
my
desire
to
see
them
,
slipping
between
my
thoughts
and
the
object
,
*NL*
whatever
it
might
be
,
upon
which
I
was
trying
to
concentrate
them
,
*NL*
whirling
in
front
of
me
like
those
brown
spots
that
sometimes
,
whatever
*NL*
we
may
be
looking
at
,
will
seem
to
be
dancing
or
swimming
before
our
*NL*
eyes
.
And
on
that
morning
,
not
hearing
the
splash
of
the
rain
as
on
the
*NL*
previous
days
,
seeing
the
smile
of
fine
weather
at
the
corners
of
my
*NL*
drawn
curtains
,
as
from
the
corners
of
closed
lips
may
escape
the
secret
*NL*
of
their
happiness
,
I
had
felt
that
I
could
actually
see
those
yellow
*NL*
leaves
,
with
the
light
shining
through
them
,
in
their
supreme
beauty
;
*NL*
and
being
no
more
able
to
restrain
myself
from
going
to
look
at
the
*NL*
trees
than
,
in
my
childhood
's
days
,
when
the
wind
howled
in
the
chimney
,
*NL*
I
had
been
able
to
resist
the
longing
to
visit
the
sea
,
I
had
risen
and
*NL*
left
the
house
to
go
to
Trianon
,
passing
through
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
*NL*
It
was
the
hour
and
the
season
in
which
the
Bois
seems
,
perhaps
,
most
*NL*
multiform
,
not
only
because
it
is
then
most
divided
,
but
because
it
*NL*
is
divided
in
a
different
way
.
Even
in
the
unwooded
parts
,
where
the
*NL*
horizon
is
large
,
here
and
there
against
the
background
of
a
dark
*NL*
and
distant
mass
of
trees
,
now
leafless
or
still
keeping
their
summer
*NL*
foliage
unchanged
,
a
double
row
of
orange-red
chestnuts
seemed
,
as
in
a
*NL*
picture
just
begun
,
to
be
the
only
thing
painted
,
so
far
,
by
an
artist
*NL*
who
had
not
yet
laid
any
colour
on
the
rest
,
and
to
be
offering
their
*NL*
cloister
,
in
full
daylight
,
for
the
casual
exercise
of
the
human
figures
*NL*
that
would
be
added
to
the
picture
later
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farther
off
,
at
a
place
where
the
trees
were
still
all
green
,
one
alone
,
*NL*
small
,
stunted
,
lopped
,
but
stubborn
in
its
resistance
,
was
tossing
*NL*
in
the
breeze
an
ugly
mane
of
red
.
Elsewhere
,
again
,
might
be
seen
*NL*
the
first
awakening
of
this
Maytime
of
the
leaves
,
and
those
of
an
*NL*
ampelopsis
,
a
smiling
miracle
,
like
a
red
hawthorn
flowering
in
winter
,
*NL*
had
that
very
morning
all
`
come
out
,
'
so
to
speak
,
in
blossom
.
And
the
*NL*
Bois
had
the
temporary
,
unfinished
,
artificial
look
of
a
nursery
garden
*NL*
or
a
park
in
which
,
either
for
some
botanic
purpose
or
in
preparation
*NL*
for
a
festival
,
there
have
been
embedded
among
the
trees
of
commoner
*NL*
growth
,
which
have
not
yet
been
uprooted
and
transplanted
elsewhere
,
a
*NL*
few
rare
specimens
,
with
fantastic
foliage
,
which
seem
to
be
clearing
*NL*
all
round
themselves
an
empty
space
,
making
room
,
giving
air
,
diffusing
*NL*
light
.
Thus
it
was
the
time
of
year
at
which
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
*NL*
displays
more
separate
characteristics
,
assembles
more
distinct
elements
*NL*
in
a
composite
whole
than
at
any
other
.
It
was
also
the
time
of
day
.
*NL*
In
places
where
the
trees
still
kept
their
leaves
,
they
seemed
to
have
*NL*
undergone
an
alteration
of
their
substance
from
the
point
at
which
they
*NL*
were
touched
by
the
sun
's
light
,
still
,
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
almost
horizontal
,
as
it
would
be
again
,
a
few
hours
later
,
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
,
just
as
dusk
began
,
it
would
flame
up
like
a
lamp
,
project
*NL*
afar
over
the
leaves
a
warm
and
artificial
glow
,
and
set
ablaze
the
few
*NL*
topmost
boughs
of
a
tree
that
would
itself
remain
unchanged
,
a
sombre
*NL*
incombustible
candelabrum
beneath
its
flaming
crest
.
At
one
spot
the
*NL*
light
grew
solid
as
a
brick
wall
,
and
like
a
piece
of
yellow
Persian
*NL*
masonry
,
patterned
in
blue
,
daubed
coarsely
upon
the
sky
the
leaves
of
*NL*
the
chestnuts
;
at
another
,
it
cut
them
off
from
the
sky
towards
which
*NL*
they
stretched
out
their
curling
,
golden
fingers
.
Half-way
up
the
trunk
*NL*
of
a
tree
draped
with
wild
vine
,
the
light
had
grafted
and
brought
to
*NL*
blossom
,
too
dazzling
to
be
clearly
distinguished
,
an
enormous
posy
,
*NL*
of
red
flowers
apparently
,
perhaps
of
a
new
variety
of
carnation
.
The
*NL*
different
parts
of
the
Bois
,
so
easily
confounded
in
summer
in
the
*NL*
density
and
monotony
of
their
universal
green
,
were
now
clearly
divided
.
*NL*
A
patch
of
brightness
indicated
the
approach
to
almost
every
one
of
*NL*
them
,
or
else
a
splendid
mass
of
foliage
stood
out
before
it
like
an
*NL*
oriflamme
.
I
could
make
out
,
as
on
a
coloured
map
,
Armenonville
,
the
*NL*
Pr√©
Catalan
,
Madrid
,
the
Race
Course
and
the
shore
of
the
lake
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
would
appear
some
meaningless
erection
,
a
sham
grotto
,
a
mill
,
for
*NL*
which
the
trees
made
room
by
drawing
away
from
it
,
or
which
was
borne
*NL*
upon
the
soft
green
platform
of
a
grassy
lawn
.
I
could
feel
that
the
*NL*
Bois
was
not
really
a
wood
,
that
it
existed
for
a
purpose
alien
to
the
*NL*
life
of
its
trees
;
my
sense
of
exaltation
was
due
not
only
to
admiration
*NL*
of
the
autumn
tints
but
to
a
bodily
desire
.
Ample
source
of
a
joy
which
*NL*
the
heart
feels
at
first
without
being
conscious
of
its
cause
,
without
*NL*
understanding
that
it
results
from
no
external
impulse
!
Thus
I
gazed
*NL*
at
the
trees
with
an
unsatisfied
longing
which
went
beyond
them
and
,
*NL*
without
my
knowledge
,
directed
itself
towards
that
masterpiece
of
*NL*
beautiful
strolling
women
which
the
trees
enframed
for
a
few
hours
every
*NL*
day
.
I
walked
towards
the
All√©e
des
Acacias
.
I
passed
through
forest
*NL*
groves
in
which
the
morning
light
,
breaking
them
into
new
sections
,
*NL*
lopped
and
trimmed
the
trees
,
united
different
trunks
in
marriage
,
made
*NL*
nosegays
of
their
branches
.
It
would
skilfully
draw
towards
it
a
pair
of
*NL*
trees
;
making
deft
use
of
the
sharp
chisel
of
light
and
shade
,
it
would
*NL*
cut
away
from
each
of
them
half
of
its
trunk
and
branches
,
and
,
weaving
*NL*
together
the
two
halves
that
remained
,
would
make
of
them
either
a
*NL*
single
pillar
of
shade
,
defined
by
the
surrounding
light
,
or
a
single
*NL*
luminous
phantom
whose
artificial
,
quivering
contour
was
encompassed
*NL*
in
a
network
of
inky
shadows
.
When
a
ray
of
sunshine
gilded
the
highest
*NL*
branches
,
they
seemed
,
soaked
and
still
dripping
with
a
sparkling
*NL*
moisture
,
to
have
emerged
alone
from
the
liquid
,
emerald-green
*NL*
atmosphere
in
which
the
whole
grove
was
plunged
as
though
beneath
the
*NL*
sea
.
For
the
trees
continued
to
live
by
their
own
vitality
,
and
when
*NL*
they
had
no
longer
any
leaves
,
that
vitality
gleamed
more
brightly
still
*NL*
from
the
nap
of
green
velvet
that
carpeted
their
trunks
,
or
in
the
white
*NL*
enamel
of
the
globes
of
mistletoe
that
were
scattered
all
the
way
up
to
*NL*
the
topmost
branches
of
the
poplars
,
rounded
as
are
the
sun
and
moon
in
*NL*
Michelangelo
's
`
Creation
.
'
But
,
forced
for
so
many
years
now
,
by
a
sort
*NL*
of
grafting
process
,
to
share
the
life
of
feminine
humanity
,
they
called
*NL*
to
my
mind
the
figure
of
the
dryad
,
the
fair
worldling
,
swiftly
walking
,
*NL*
brightly
coloured
,
whom
they
sheltered
with
their
branches
as
she
*NL*
passed
beneath
them
,
and
obliged
to
acknowledge
,
as
they
themselves
*NL*
acknowledged
,
the
power
of
the
season
;
they
recalled
to
me
the
happy
*NL*
days
when
I
was
young
and
had
faith
,
when
I
would
hasten
eagerly
to
the
*NL*
spots
where
masterpieces
of
female
elegance
would
be
incarnate
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
beneath
the
unconscious
,
accommodating
boughs
.
But
the
beauty
*NL*
for
which
the
firs
and
acacias
of
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
made
me
long
,
*NL*
more
disquieting
in
that
respect
than
the
chestnuts
and
lilacs
of
*NL*
Trianon
which
I
was
going
to
see
,
was
not
fixed
somewhere
outside
myself
*NL*
in
the
relics
of
an
historical
period
,
in
works
of
art
,
in
a
little
*NL*
temple
of
love
at
whose
door
was
piled
an
oblation
of
autumn
leaves
*NL*
ribbed
with
gold
.
I
reached
the
shore
of
the
lake
;
I
walked
on
as
far
as
*NL*
the
pigeon-shooting
ground
.
The
idea
of
perfection
which
I
had
within
me
*NL*
I
had
bestowed
,
in
that
other
time
,
upon
the
height
of
a
victoria
,
upon
*NL*
the
raking
thinness
of
those
horses
,
frenzied
and
light
as
wasps
upon
*NL*
the
wing
,
with
bloodshot
eyes
like
the
cruel
steeds
of
Diomed
,
which
*NL*
now
,
smitten
by
a
desire
to
see
again
what
I
had
once
loved
,
as
ardent
*NL*
as
the
desire
that
had
driven
me
,
many
years
before
,
along
the
same
*NL*
paths
,
I
wished
to
see
renewed
before
my
eyes
at
the
moment
when
Mme.
*NL*
Swann
's
enormous
coachman
,
supervised
by
a
groom
no
bigger
than
his
*NL*
fist
,
and
as
infantile
as
Saint
George
in
the
picture
,
endeavoured
to
*NL*
curb
the
ardour
of
the
flying
,
steel-tipped
pinions
with
which
they
*NL*
thundered
along
the
ground
.
Alas
!
there
was
nothing
now
but
motor-cars
*NL*
driven
each
by
a
moustached
mechanic
,
with
a
tall
footman
towering
by
*NL*
his
side
.
I
wished
to
hold
before
my
bodily
eyes
,
that
I
might
know
*NL*
whether
they
were
indeed
as
charming
as
they
appeared
to
the
eyes
of
*NL*
memory
,
little
hats
,
so
low-crowned
as
to
seem
no
more
than
garlands
*NL*
about
the
brows
of
women
.
All
the
hats
now
were
immense
;
covered
with
*NL*
fruits
and
flowers
and
all
manner
of
birds
.
In
place
of
the
lovely
gowns
*NL*
in
which
Mme.
Swann
walked
like
a
Queen
,
appeared
Greco-Saxon
tunics
,
*NL*
with
Tanagra
folds
,
or
sometimes
,
in
the
Directoire
style
,
`
Liberty
*NL*
chiffons
'
sprinkled
with
flowers
like
sheets
of
wallpaper
.
On
the
heads
*NL*
of
the
gentlemen
who
might
have
been
eligible
to
stroll
with
Mme.
Swann
*NL*
in
the
All√©e
de
la
Reine
Marguerite
,
I
found
not
the
grey
'til
e
'
hats
*NL*
of
old
,
nor
any
other
kind
.
They
walked
the
Bois
bare-headed
.
And
seeing
*NL*
all
these
new
elements
of
the
spectacle
,
I
had
no
longer
the
faith
*NL*
which
,
applied
to
them
,
would
have
given
them
consistency
,
unity
,
*NL*
life
;
they
passed
in
a
scattered
sequence
before
me
,
at
random
,
without
*NL*
reality
,
containing
in
themselves
no
beauty
that
my
eyes
might
have
*NL*
endeavoured
as
in
the
old
days
,
to
extract
from
them
and
to
compose
in
*NL*
a
picture
.
They
were
just
women
,
in
whose
elegance
I
had
no
belief
,
*NL*
and
whose
clothes
seemed
to
me
unimportant
.
But
when
a
belief
vanishes
,
*NL*
there
survives
it
--
more
and
more
ardently
,
so
as
to
cloak
the
absence
*NL*
of
the
power
,
now
lost
to
us
,
of
imparting
reality
to
new
phenomena
--
an
*NL*
idolatrous
attachment
to
the
old
things
which
our
belief
in
them
did
*NL*
once
animate
,
as
if
it
was
in
that
belief
and
not
in
ourselves
that
the
*NL*
divine
spark
resided
,
and
as
if
our
present
incredulity
had
a
contingent
*NL*
cause
--
the
death
of
the
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
horrible
!
''
I
exclaimed
to
myself
:
``
Does
anyone
really
imagine
that
*NL*
these
motor-cars
are
as
smart
as
the
old
carriage-and-pair
?
I
dare
say
.
*NL*
I
am
too
old
now
--
but
I
was
not
intended
for
a
world
in
which
women
*NL*
shackle
themselves
in
garments
that
are
not
even
made
of
cloth
.
To
what
*NL*
purpose
shall
I
walk
among
these
trees
if
there
is
nothing
left
now
of
*NL*
the
assembly
that
used
to
meet
beneath
the
delicate
tracery
of
reddening
*NL*
leaves
,
if
vulgarity
and
fatuity
have
supplanted
the
exquisite
thing
*NL*
that
once
their
branches
framed
?
Oh
,
horrible
!
My
consolation
is
to
*NL*
think
of
the
women
whom
I
have
known
,
in
the
past
,
now
that
there
is
*NL*
no
standard
left
of
elegance
.
But
how
can
the
people
who
watch
these
*NL*
dreadful
creatures
hobble
by
,
beneath
hats
on
which
have
been
heaped
*NL*
the
spoils
of
aviary
or
garden-bed
,
--
how
can
they
imagine
the
charm
that
*NL*
there
was
in
the
sight
of
Mme.
Swann
,
crowned
with
a
close-fitting
lilac
*NL*
bonnet
,
or
with
a
tiny
hat
from
which
rose
stiffly
above
her
head
a
*NL*
single
iris
?
''
Could
I
ever
have
made
them
understand
the
emotion
that
*NL*
I
used
to
feel
on
winter
mornings
,
when
I
met
Mme.
Swann
on
foot
,
in
an
*NL*
otter-skin
coat
,
with
a
woollen
cap
from
which
stuck
out
two
blade-like
*NL*
partridge-feathers
,
but
enveloped
also
in
the
deliberate
,
artificial
*NL*
warmth
of
her
own
house
,
which
was
suggested
by
nothing
more
than
the
*NL*
bunch
of
violets
crushed
into
her
bosom
,
whose
flowering
,
vivid
and
blue
*NL*
against
the
grey
sky
,
the
freezing
air
,
the
naked
boughs
,
had
the
same
*NL*
charming
effect
of
using
the
season
and
the
weather
merely
as
a
setting
,
*NL*
and
of
living
actually
in
a
human
atmosphere
,
in
the
atmosphere
of
this
*NL*
woman
,
as
had
in
the
vases
and
beaupots
of
her
drawing-room
,
beside
the
*NL*
blazing
fire
,
in
front
of
the
silk-covered
sofa
,
the
flowers
that
looked
*NL*
out
through
closed
windows
at
the
falling
snow
?
But
it
would
not
have
*NL*
sufficed
me
that
the
costumes
alone
should
still
have
been
the
same
as
*NL*
in
those
distant
years
.
Because
of
the
solidarity
that
binds
together
*NL*
the
different
parts
of
a
general
impression
,
parts
that
our
memory
keeps
*NL*
in
a
balanced
whole
,
of
which
we
are
not
permitted
to
subtract
or
to
*NL*
decline
any
fraction
,
I
should
have
liked
to
be
able
to
pass
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
day
with
one
of
those
women
,
over
a
cup
of
tea
,
in
a
little
house
*NL*
with
dark-painted
walls
-LRB-
as
Mme.
Swann
's
were
still
in
the
year
after
*NL*
that
in
which
the
first
part
of
this
story
ends
-RRB-
against
which
would
*NL*
glow
the
orange
flame
,
the
red
combustion
,
the
pink
and
white
flickering
*NL*
of
her
chrysanthemums
in
the
twilight
of
a
November
evening
,
in
moments
*NL*
similar
to
those
in
which
-LRB-
as
we
shall
see
-RRB-
I
had
not
managed
to
*NL*
discover
the
pleasures
for
which
I
longed
.
But
now
,
albeit
they
had
led
*NL*
to
nothing
,
those
moments
struck
me
as
having
been
charming
enough
in
*NL*
themselves
.
I
sought
to
find
them
again
as
I
remembered
them
.
Alas
!
*NL*
there
was
nothing
now
but
flats
decorated
in
the
Louis
XVI
style
,
all
*NL*
white
paint
,
with
hortensias
in
blue
enamel
.
Moreover
,
people
did
not
*NL*
return
to
Paris
,
now
,
until
much
later
.
Mme.
Swann
would
have
written
to
*NL*
me
,
from
a
country
house
,
that
she
would
not
be
in
town
before
February
,
*NL*
had
I
asked
her
to
reconstruct
for
me
the
elements
of
that
memory
which
*NL*
I
felt
to
belong
to
a
distant
era
,
to
a
date
in
time
towards
which
it
*NL*
was
forbidden
me
to
ascend
again
the
fatal
slope
,
the
elements
of
that
*NL*
longing
which
had
become
,
itself
,
as
inaccessible
as
the
pleasure
that
*NL*
it
had
once
vainly
pursued
.
And
I
should
have
required
also
that
they
*NL*
be
the
same
women
,
those
whose
costume
interested
me
because
,
at
a
time
*NL*
when
I
still
had
faith
,
my
imagination
had
individualised
them
and
had
*NL*
provided
each
of
them
with
a
legend
.
Alas
!
in
the
acacia-avenue
--
the
*NL*
myrtle-alley
--
I
did
see
some
of
them
again
,
grown
old
,
no
more
now
*NL*
than
grim
spectres
of
what
once
they
had
been
,
wandering
to
and
fro
,
in
*NL*
desperate
search
of
heaven
knew
what
,
through
the
Virgilian
groves
.
They
*NL*
had
long
fled
,
and
still
I
stood
vainly
questioning
the
deserted
paths
.
*NL*
The
sun
's
face
was
hidden
.
Nature
began
again
to
reign
over
the
Bois
,
*NL*
from
which
had
vanished
all
trace
of
the
idea
that
it
was
the
Elysian
*NL*
Garden
of
Woman
;
above
the
gimcrack
windmill
the
real
sky
was
grey
;
the
*NL*
wind
wrinkled
the
surface
of
the
Grand
Lac
in
little
wavelets
,
like
*NL*
a
real
lake
;
large
birds
passed
swiftly
over
the
Bois
,
as
over
a
real
*NL*
wood
,
and
with
shrill
cries
perched
,
one
after
another
,
on
the
great
*NL*
oaks
which
,
beneath
their
Druidical
crown
,
and
with
Dodonaic
majesty
,
*NL*
seemed
to
proclaim
the
unpeopled
vacancy
of
this
estranged
forest
,
and
*NL*
helped
me
to
understand
how
paradoxical
it
is
to
seek
in
reality
for
the
*NL*
pictures
that
are
stored
in
one
's
memory
,
which
must
inevitably
lose
*NL*
the
charm
that
comes
to
them
from
memory
itself
and
from
their
not
*NL*
being
apprehended
by
the
senses
.
The
reality
that
I
had
known
no
longer
*NL*
existed
.
It
sufficed
that
Mme.
Swann
did
not
appear
,
in
the
same
attire
*NL*
and
at
the
same
moment
,
for
the
whole
avenue
to
be
altered
.
The
places
*NL*
that
we
have
known
belong
now
only
to
the
little
world
of
space
on
which
*NL*
we
map
them
for
our
own
convenience
.
None
of
them
was
ever
more
than
a
*NL*
thin
slice
,
held
between
the
contiguous
impressions
that
composed
our
*NL*
life
at
that
time
;
remembrance
of
a
particular
form
is
but
regret
for
a
*NL*
particular
moment
;
and
houses
,
roads
,
avenues
are
as
fugitive
,
alas
,
as
*NL*
the
years
.
