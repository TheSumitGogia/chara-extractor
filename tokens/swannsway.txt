OVERTURE
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
I
used
to
go
to
bed
early
.
Sometimes
,
when
I
had
put
out
*NL*
my
candle
,
my
eyes
would
close
so
quickly
that
I
had
not
even
time
to
*NL*
say
``
I
'm
going
to
sleep
.
''
And
half
an
hour
later
the
thought
that
it
was
*NL*
time
to
go
to
sleep
would
awaken
me
;
I
would
try
to
put
away
the
book
*NL*
which
,
I
imagined
,
was
still
in
my
hands
,
and
to
blow
out
the
light
;
I
*NL*
had
been
thinking
all
the
time
,
while
I
was
asleep
,
of
what
I
had
just
*NL*
been
reading
,
but
my
thoughts
had
run
into
a
channel
of
their
own
,
*NL*
until
I
myself
seemed
actually
to
have
become
the
subject
of
my
book
:
*NL*
a
church
,
a
quartet
,
the
rivalry
between
François
I
and
Charles
V
.
This
*NL*
impression
would
persist
for
some
moments
after
I
was
awake
;
it
did
not
*NL*
disturb
my
mind
,
but
it
lay
like
scales
upon
my
eyes
and
prevented
them
*NL*
from
registering
the
fact
that
the
candle
was
no
longer
burning
.
Then
*NL*
it
would
begin
to
seem
unintelligible
,
as
the
thoughts
of
a
former
*NL*
existence
must
be
to
a
reincarnate
spirit
;
the
subject
of
my
book
would
*NL*
separate
itself
from
me
,
leaving
me
free
to
choose
whether
I
would
form
*NL*
part
of
it
or
no
;
and
at
the
same
time
my
sight
would
return
and
I
*NL*
would
be
astonished
to
find
myself
in
a
state
of
darkness
,
pleasant
and
*NL*
restful
enough
for
the
eyes
,
and
even
more
,
perhaps
,
for
my
mind
,
to
*NL*
which
it
appeared
incomprehensible
,
without
a
cause
,
a
matter
dark
*NL*
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
ask
myself
what
o'clock
it
could
be
;
I
could
hear
the
whistling
*NL*
of
trains
,
which
,
now
nearer
and
now
farther
off
,
punctuating
the
*NL*
distance
like
the
note
of
a
bird
in
a
forest
,
shewed
me
in
perspective
*NL*
the
deserted
countryside
through
which
a
traveller
would
be
hurrying
*NL*
towards
the
nearest
station
:
the
path
that
he
followed
being
fixed
for
*NL*
ever
in
his
memory
by
the
general
excitement
due
to
being
in
a
strange
*NL*
place
,
to
doing
unusual
things
,
to
the
last
words
of
conversation
,
to
*NL*
farewells
exchanged
beneath
an
unfamiliar
lamp
which
echoed
still
in
his
*NL*
ears
amid
the
silence
of
the
night
;
and
to
the
delightful
prospect
of
*NL*
being
once
again
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
lay
my
cheeks
gently
against
the
comfortable
cheeks
of
my
*NL*
pillow
,
as
plump
and
blooming
as
the
cheeks
of
babyhood
.
Or
I
would
*NL*
strike
a
match
to
look
at
my
watch
.
Nearly
midnight
.
The
hour
when
an
*NL*
invalid
,
who
has
been
obliged
to
start
on
a
journey
and
to
sleep
in
a
*NL*
strange
hotel
,
awakens
in
a
moment
of
illness
and
sees
with
glad
relief
*NL*
a
streak
of
daylight
shewing
under
his
bedroom
door
.
Oh
,
joy
of
joys
!
*NL*
it
is
morning
.
The
servants
will
be
about
in
a
minute
:
he
can
ring
,
*NL*
and
some
one
will
come
to
look
after
him
.
The
thought
of
being
made
*NL*
comfortable
gives
him
strength
to
endure
his
pain
.
He
is
certain
he
*NL*
heard
footsteps
:
they
come
nearer
,
and
then
die
away
.
The
ray
of
light
*NL*
beneath
his
door
is
extinguished
.
It
is
midnight
;
some
one
has
turned
*NL*
out
the
gas
;
the
last
servant
has
gone
to
bed
,
and
he
must
lie
all
night
*NL*
in
agony
with
no
one
to
bring
him
any
help
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
fall
asleep
,
and
often
I
would
be
awake
again
for
short
snatches
*NL*
only
,
just
long
enough
to
hear
the
regular
creaking
of
the
wainscot
,
or
*NL*
to
open
my
eyes
to
settle
the
shifting
kaleidoscope
of
the
darkness
,
*NL*
to
savour
,
in
an
instantaneous
flash
of
perception
,
the
sleep
which
lay
*NL*
heavy
upon
the
furniture
,
the
room
,
the
whole
surroundings
of
which
I
*NL*
formed
but
an
insignificant
part
and
whose
unconsciousness
I
should
very
*NL*
soon
return
to
share
.
Or
,
perhaps
,
while
I
was
asleep
I
had
returned
*NL*
without
the
least
effort
to
an
earlier
stage
in
my
life
,
now
for
ever
*NL*
outgrown
;
and
had
come
under
the
thrall
of
one
of
my
childish
terrors
,
*NL*
such
as
that
old
terror
of
my
great-uncle
's
pulling
my
curls
,
which
was
*NL*
effectually
dispelled
on
the
day
--
the
dawn
of
a
new
era
to
me
--
on
which
*NL*
they
were
finally
cropped
from
my
head
.
I
had
forgotten
that
event
*NL*
during
my
sleep
;
I
remembered
it
again
immediately
I
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
making
myself
wake
up
to
escape
my
great-uncle
's
fingers
;
still
,
as
a
*NL*
measure
of
precaution
,
I
would
bury
the
whole
of
my
head
in
the
pillow
*NL*
before
returning
to
the
world
of
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
too
,
just
as
Eve
was
created
from
a
rib
of
Adam
,
so
a
woman
*NL*
would
come
into
existence
while
I
was
sleeping
,
conceived
from
some
*NL*
strain
in
the
position
of
my
limbs
.
Formed
by
the
appetite
that
I
was
*NL*
on
the
point
of
gratifying
,
she
it
was
,
I
imagined
,
who
offered
me
that
*NL*
gratification
.
My
body
,
conscious
that
its
own
warmth
was
permeating
*NL*
hers
,
would
strive
to
become
one
with
her
,
and
I
would
awake
.
The
rest
*NL*
of
humanity
seemed
very
remote
in
comparison
with
this
woman
whose
*NL*
company
I
had
left
but
a
moment
ago
:
my
cheek
was
still
warm
with
her
*NL*
kiss
,
my
body
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
hers
.
If
,
as
would
sometimes
*NL*
happen
,
she
had
the
appearance
of
some
woman
whom
I
had
known
in
waking
*NL*
hours
,
I
would
abandon
myself
altogether
to
the
sole
quest
of
her
,
like
*NL*
people
who
set
out
on
a
journey
to
see
with
their
own
eyes
some
city
*NL*
that
they
have
always
longed
to
visit
,
and
imagine
that
they
can
taste
*NL*
in
reality
what
has
charmed
their
fancy
.
And
then
,
gradually
,
the
memory
*NL*
of
her
would
dissolve
and
vanish
,
until
I
had
forgotten
the
maiden
of
my
*NL*
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
man
is
asleep
,
he
has
in
a
circle
round
him
the
chain
of
the
*NL*
hours
,
the
sequence
of
the
years
,
the
order
of
the
heavenly
host
.
*NL*
Instinctively
,
when
he
awakes
,
he
looks
to
these
,
and
in
an
instant
*NL*
reads
off
his
own
position
on
the
earth
's
surface
and
the
amount
of
time
*NL*
that
has
elapsed
during
his
slumbers
;
but
this
ordered
procession
is
apt
*NL*
to
grow
confused
,
and
to
break
its
ranks
.
Suppose
that
,
towards
morning
,
*NL*
after
a
night
of
insomnia
,
sleep
descends
upon
him
while
he
is
reading
,
*NL*
in
quite
a
different
position
from
that
in
which
he
normally
goes
to
*NL*
sleep
,
he
has
only
to
lift
his
arm
to
arrest
the
sun
and
turn
it
back
*NL*
in
its
course
,
and
,
at
the
moment
of
waking
,
he
will
have
no
idea
of
the
*NL*
time
,
but
will
conclude
that
he
has
just
gone
to
bed
.
Or
suppose
that
he
*NL*
gets
drowsy
in
some
even
more
abnormal
position
;
sitting
in
an
armchair
,
*NL*
say
,
after
dinner
:
then
the
world
will
fall
topsy-turvy
from
its
orbit
,
*NL*
the
magic
chair
will
carry
him
at
full
speed
through
time
and
space
,
*NL*
and
when
he
opens
his
eyes
again
he
will
imagine
that
he
went
to
sleep
*NL*
months
earlier
and
in
some
far
distant
country
.
But
for
me
it
was
enough
*NL*
if
,
in
my
own
bed
,
my
sleep
was
so
heavy
as
completely
to
relax
my
*NL*
consciousness
;
for
then
I
lost
all
sense
of
the
place
in
which
I
had
*NL*
gone
to
sleep
,
and
when
I
awoke
at
midnight
,
not
knowing
where
I
was
,
*NL*
I
could
not
be
sure
at
first
who
I
was
;
I
had
only
the
most
rudimentary
*NL*
sense
of
existence
,
such
as
may
lurk
and
flicker
in
the
depths
of
an
*NL*
animal
's
consciousness
;
I
was
more
destitute
of
human
qualities
than
the
*NL*
cave-dweller
;
but
then
the
memory
,
not
yet
of
the
place
in
which
I
*NL*
was
,
but
of
various
other
places
where
I
had
lived
,
and
might
now
very
*NL*
possibly
be
,
would
come
like
a
rope
let
down
from
heaven
to
draw
me
up
*NL*
out
of
the
abyss
of
not-being
,
from
which
I
could
never
have
escaped
*NL*
by
myself
:
in
a
flash
I
would
traverse
and
surmount
centuries
of
*NL*
civilisation
,
and
out
of
a
half-visualised
succession
of
oil-lamps
,
*NL*
followed
by
shirts
with
turned-down
collars
,
would
put
together
by
*NL*
degrees
the
component
parts
of
my
ego
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
immobility
of
the
things
that
surround
us
is
forced
upon
*NL*
them
by
our
conviction
that
they
are
themselves
,
and
not
anything
else
,
*NL*
and
by
the
immobility
of
our
conceptions
of
them
.
For
it
always
happened
*NL*
that
when
I
awoke
like
this
,
and
my
mind
struggled
in
an
unsuccessful
*NL*
attempt
to
discover
where
I
was
,
everything
would
be
moving
round
me
*NL*
through
the
darkness
:
things
,
places
,
years
.
My
body
,
still
too
heavy
*NL*
with
sleep
to
move
,
would
make
an
effort
to
construe
the
form
which
its
*NL*
tiredness
took
as
an
orientation
of
its
various
members
,
so
as
to
induce
*NL*
from
that
where
the
wall
lay
and
the
furniture
stood
,
to
piece
together
*NL*
and
to
give
a
name
to
the
house
in
which
it
must
be
living
.
Its
memory
,
*NL*
the
composite
memory
of
its
ribs
,
knees
,
and
shoulder-blades
offered
it
*NL*
a
whole
series
of
rooms
in
which
it
had
at
one
time
or
another
slept
;
*NL*
while
the
unseen
walls
kept
changing
,
adapting
themselves
to
the
shape
*NL*
of
each
successive
room
that
it
remembered
,
whirling
madly
through
the
*NL*
darkness
.
And
even
before
my
brain
,
lingering
in
consideration
of
when
*NL*
things
had
happened
and
of
what
they
had
looked
like
,
had
collected
*NL*
sufficient
impressions
to
enable
it
to
identify
the
room
,
it
,
my
body
,
*NL*
would
recall
from
each
room
in
succession
what
the
bed
was
like
,
where
*NL*
the
doors
were
,
how
daylight
came
in
at
the
windows
,
whether
there
was
a
*NL*
passage
outside
,
what
I
had
had
in
my
mind
when
I
went
to
sleep
,
and
had
*NL*
found
there
when
I
awoke
.
The
stiffened
side
underneath
my
body
would
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
in
trying
to
fix
its
position
,
imagine
itself
to
be
lying
,
*NL*
face
to
the
wall
,
in
a
big
bed
with
a
canopy
;
and
at
once
I
would
say
to
*NL*
myself
,
``
Why
,
I
must
have
gone
to
sleep
after
all
,
and
Mamma
never
came
*NL*
to
say
good
night
!
''
for
I
was
in
the
country
with
my
grandfather
,
who
*NL*
died
years
ago
;
and
my
body
,
the
side
upon
which
I
was
lying
,
loyally
*NL*
preserving
from
the
past
an
impression
which
my
mind
should
never
have
*NL*
forgotten
,
brought
back
before
my
eyes
the
glimmering
flame
of
the
*NL*
night-light
in
its
bowl
of
Bohemian
glass
,
shaped
like
an
urn
and
hung
*NL*
by
chains
from
the
ceiling
,
and
the
chimney-piece
of
Siena
marble
in
my
*NL*
bedroom
at
Combray
,
in
my
great-aunt
's
house
,
in
those
far
distant
days
*NL*
which
,
at
the
moment
of
waking
,
seemed
present
without
being
clearly
*NL*
penned
,
but
would
become
plainer
in
a
little
while
when
I
was
properly
*NL*
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
would
come
up
the
memory
of
a
fresh
position
;
the
wall
slid
away
in
*NL*
another
direction
;
I
was
in
my
room
in
Mme.
de
Saint-Loup
's
house
in
the
*NL*
country
;
good
heavens
,
it
must
be
ten
o'clock
,
they
will
have
finished
*NL*
dinner
!
I
must
have
overslept
myself
,
in
the
little
nap
which
I
always
*NL*
take
when
I
come
in
from
my
walk
with
Mme.
de
Saint-Loup
,
before
*NL*
dressing
for
the
evening
.
For
many
years
have
now
elapsed
since
the
*NL*
Combray
days
,
when
,
coming
in
from
the
longest
and
latest
walks
,
I
would
*NL*
still
be
in
time
to
see
the
reflection
of
the
sunset
glowing
in
the
*NL*
panes
of
my
bedroom
window
.
It
is
a
very
different
kind
of
existence
*NL*
at
Tansonville
now
with
Mme.
de
Saint-Loup
,
and
a
different
kind
of
*NL*
pleasure
that
I
now
derive
from
taking
walks
only
in
the
evenings
,
from
*NL*
visiting
by
moonlight
the
roads
on
which
I
used
to
play
,
as
a
child
,
in
*NL*
the
sunshine
;
while
the
bedroom
,
in
which
I
shall
presently
fall
asleep
*NL*
instead
of
dressing
for
dinner
,
from
afar
off
I
can
see
it
,
as
we
return
*NL*
from
our
walk
,
with
its
lamp
shining
through
the
window
,
a
solitary
*NL*
beacon
in
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
shifting
and
confused
gusts
of
memory
never
lasted
for
more
than
*NL*
a
few
seconds
;
it
often
happened
that
,
in
my
spell
of
uncertainty
as
to
*NL*
where
I
was
,
I
did
not
distinguish
the
successive
theories
of
which
that
*NL*
uncertainty
was
composed
any
more
than
,
when
we
watch
a
horse
running
,
*NL*
we
isolate
the
successive
positions
of
its
body
as
they
appear
upon
*NL*
a
bioscope
.
But
I
had
seen
first
one
and
then
another
of
the
rooms
in
*NL*
which
I
had
slept
during
my
life
,
and
in
the
end
I
would
revisit
them
*NL*
all
in
the
long
course
of
my
waking
dream
:
rooms
in
winter
,
where
on
*NL*
going
to
bed
I
would
at
once
bury
my
head
in
a
nest
,
built
up
out
of
the
*NL*
most
diverse
materials
,
the
corner
of
my
pillow
,
the
top
of
my
blankets
,
*NL*
a
piece
of
a
shawl
,
the
edge
of
my
bed
,
and
a
copy
of
an
evening
paper
,
*NL*
all
of
which
things
I
would
contrive
,
with
the
infinite
patience
of
*NL*
birds
building
their
nests
,
to
cement
into
one
whole
;
rooms
where
,
in
*NL*
a
keen
frost
,
I
would
feel
the
satisfaction
of
being
shut
in
from
the
*NL*
outer
world
-LRB-
like
the
sea-swallow
which
builds
at
the
end
of
a
dark
*NL*
tunnel
and
is
kept
warm
by
the
surrounding
earth
-RRB-
,
and
where
,
the
fire
*NL*
keeping
in
all
night
,
I
would
sleep
wrapped
up
,
as
it
were
,
in
a
great
*NL*
cloak
of
snug
and
savoury
air
,
shot
with
the
glow
of
the
logs
which
*NL*
would
break
out
again
in
flame
:
in
a
sort
of
alcove
without
walls
,
a
*NL*
cave
of
warmth
dug
out
of
the
heart
of
the
room
itself
,
a
zone
of
heat
*NL*
whose
boundaries
were
constantly
shifting
and
altering
in
temperature
*NL*
as
gusts
of
air
ran
across
them
to
strike
freshly
upon
my
face
,
from
*NL*
the
corners
of
the
room
,
or
from
parts
near
the
window
or
far
from
the
*NL*
fireplace
which
had
therefore
remained
cold
--
or
rooms
in
summer
,
where
*NL*
I
would
delight
to
feel
myself
a
part
of
the
warm
evening
,
where
the
*NL*
moonlight
striking
upon
the
half-opened
shutters
would
throw
down
to
the
*NL*
foot
of
my
bed
its
enchanted
ladder
;
where
I
would
fall
asleep
,
as
it
*NL*
might
be
in
the
open
air
,
like
a
titmouse
which
the
breeze
keeps
poised
*NL*
in
the
focus
of
a
sunbeam
--
or
sometimes
the
Louis
XVI
room
,
so
cheerful
*NL*
that
I
could
never
feel
really
unhappy
,
even
on
my
first
night
in
it
:
*NL*
that
room
where
the
slender
columns
which
lightly
supported
its
ceiling
*NL*
would
part
,
ever
so
gracefully
,
to
indicate
where
the
bed
was
and
*NL*
to
keep
it
separate
;
sometimes
again
that
little
room
with
the
high
*NL*
ceiling
,
hollowed
in
the
form
of
a
pyramid
out
of
two
separate
storeys
,
*NL*
and
partly
walled
with
mahogany
,
in
which
from
the
first
moment
my
mind
*NL*
was
drugged
by
the
unfamiliar
scent
of
flowering
grasses
,
convinced
of
*NL*
the
hostility
of
the
violet
curtains
and
of
the
insolent
indifference
of
*NL*
a
clock
that
chattered
on
at
the
top
of
its
voice
as
though
I
were
not
*NL*
there
;
while
a
strange
and
pitiless
mirror
with
square
feet
,
which
*NL*
stood
across
one
corner
of
the
room
,
cleared
for
itself
a
site
I
had
not
*NL*
looked
to
find
tenanted
in
the
quiet
surroundings
of
my
normal
field
of
*NL*
vision
:
that
room
in
which
my
mind
,
forcing
itself
for
hours
on
end
*NL*
to
leave
its
moorings
,
to
elongate
itself
upwards
so
as
to
take
on
the
*NL*
exact
shape
of
the
room
,
and
to
reach
to
the
summit
of
that
monstrous
*NL*
funnel
,
had
passed
so
many
anxious
nights
while
my
body
lay
stretched
*NL*
out
in
bed
,
my
eyes
staring
upwards
,
my
ears
straining
,
my
nostrils
*NL*
sniffing
uneasily
,
and
my
heart
beating
;
until
custom
had
changed
the
*NL*
colour
of
the
curtains
,
made
the
clock
keep
quiet
,
brought
an
expression
*NL*
of
pity
to
the
cruel
,
slanting
face
of
the
glass
,
disguised
or
even
*NL*
completely
dispelled
the
scent
of
flowering
grasses
,
and
distinctly
*NL*
reduced
the
apparent
loftiness
of
the
ceiling
.
Custom
!
that
skilful
but
*NL*
unhurrying
manager
who
begins
by
torturing
the
mind
for
weeks
on
end
*NL*
with
her
provisional
arrangements
;
whom
the
mind
,
for
all
that
,
is
*NL*
fortunate
in
discovering
,
for
without
the
help
of
custom
it
would
never
*NL*
contrive
,
by
its
own
efforts
,
to
make
any
room
seem
habitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
I
was
now
well
awake
;
my
body
had
turned
about
for
the
last
*NL*
time
and
the
good
angel
of
certainty
had
made
all
the
surrounding
*NL*
objects
stand
still
,
had
set
me
down
under
my
bedclothes
,
in
my
bedroom
,
*NL*
and
had
fixed
,
approximately
in
their
right
places
in
the
uncertain
*NL*
light
,
my
chest
of
drawers
,
my
writing-table
,
my
fireplace
,
the
window
*NL*
overlooking
the
street
,
and
both
the
doors
.
But
it
was
no
good
my
*NL*
knowing
that
I
was
not
in
any
of
those
houses
of
which
,
in
the
stupid
*NL*
moment
of
waking
,
if
I
had
not
caught
sight
exactly
,
I
could
still
*NL*
believe
in
their
possible
presence
;
for
memory
was
now
set
in
motion
;
as
*NL*
a
rule
I
did
not
attempt
to
go
to
sleep
again
at
once
,
but
used
to
spend
*NL*
the
greater
part
of
the
night
recalling
our
life
in
the
old
days
at
*NL*
Combray
with
my
great-aunt
,
at
Balbec
,
Paris
,
Doncières
,
Venice
,
and
the
*NL*
rest
;
remembering
again
all
the
places
and
people
that
I
had
known
,
what
*NL*
I
had
actually
seen
of
them
,
and
what
others
had
told
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Combray
,
as
every
afternoon
ended
,
long
before
the
time
when
I
should
*NL*
have
to
go
up
to
bed
,
and
to
lie
there
,
unsleeping
,
far
from
my
*NL*
mother
and
grandmother
,
my
bedroom
became
the
fixed
point
on
which
my
*NL*
melancholy
and
anxious
thoughts
were
centred
.
Some
one
had
had
the
happy
*NL*
idea
of
giving
me
,
to
distract
me
on
evenings
when
I
seemed
abnormally
*NL*
wretched
,
a
magic
lantern
,
which
used
to
be
set
on
top
of
my
lamp
while
*NL*
we
waited
for
dinner-time
to
come
:
in
the
manner
of
the
master-builders
*NL*
and
glass-painters
of
gothic
days
it
substituted
for
the
opaqueness
*NL*
of
my
walls
an
impalpable
iridescence
,
supernatural
phenomena
of
many
*NL*
colours
,
in
which
legends
were
depicted
,
as
on
a
shifting
and
transitory
*NL*
window
.
But
my
sorrows
were
only
increased
,
because
this
change
of
*NL*
lighting
destroyed
,
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
,
the
customary
*NL*
impression
I
had
formed
of
my
room
,
thanks
to
which
the
room
itself
,
*NL*
but
for
the
torture
of
having
to
go
to
bed
in
it
,
had
become
quite
*NL*
endurable
.
For
now
I
no
longer
recognised
it
,
and
I
became
uneasy
,
as
*NL*
though
I
were
in
a
room
in
some
hotel
or
furnished
lodging
,
in
a
place
*NL*
where
I
had
just
arrived
,
by
train
,
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Riding
at
a
jerky
trot
,
Golo
,
his
mind
filled
with
an
infamous
design
,
*NL*
issued
from
the
little
three-cornered
forest
which
dyed
dark-green
the
*NL*
slope
of
a
convenient
hill
,
and
advanced
by
leaps
and
bounds
towards
the
*NL*
castle
of
poor
Geneviève
de
Brabant
.
This
castle
was
cut
off
short
by
*NL*
a
curved
line
which
was
in
fact
the
circumference
of
one
of
the
*NL*
transparent
ovals
in
the
slides
which
were
pushed
into
position
through
*NL*
a
slot
in
the
lantern
.
It
was
only
the
wing
of
a
castle
,
and
in
front
*NL*
of
it
stretched
a
moor
on
which
Geneviève
stood
,
lost
in
contemplation
,
*NL*
wearing
a
blue
girdle
.
The
castle
and
the
moor
were
yellow
,
but
I
could
*NL*
tell
their
colour
without
waiting
to
see
them
,
for
before
the
slides
*NL*
made
their
appearance
the
old-gold
sonorous
name
of
Brabant
had
given
*NL*
me
an
unmistakable
clue
.
Golo
stopped
for
a
moment
and
listened
sadly
to
*NL*
the
little
speech
read
aloud
by
my
great-aunt
,
which
he
seemed
perfectly
*NL*
to
understand
,
for
he
modified
his
attitude
with
a
docility
not
devoid
*NL*
of
a
degree
of
majesty
,
so
as
to
conform
to
the
indications
given
in
the
*NL*
text
;
then
he
rode
away
at
the
same
jerky
trot
.
And
nothing
could
arrest
*NL*
his
slow
progress
.
If
the
lantern
were
moved
I
could
still
distinguish
*NL*
Golo
's
horse
advancing
across
the
window-curtains
,
swelling
out
with
*NL*
their
curves
and
diving
into
their
folds
.
The
body
of
Golo
himself
,
*NL*
being
of
the
same
supernatural
substance
as
his
steed
's
,
overcame
all
*NL*
material
obstacles
--
everything
that
seemed
to
bar
his
way
--
by
taking
*NL*
each
as
it
might
be
a
skeleton
and
embodying
it
in
himself
:
the
*NL*
door-handle
,
for
instance
,
over
which
,
adapting
itself
at
once
,
would
*NL*
float
invincibly
his
red
cloak
or
his
pale
face
,
never
losing
its
*NL*
nobility
or
its
melancholy
,
never
shewing
any
sign
of
trouble
at
such
a
*NL*
transubstantiation
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
I
found
plenty
of
charm
in
these
bright
projections
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
have
come
straight
out
of
a
Merovingian
past
,
and
to
shed
*NL*
around
me
the
reflections
of
such
ancient
history
.
But
I
can
not
express
*NL*
the
discomfort
I
felt
at
such
an
intrusion
of
mystery
and
beauty
into
*NL*
a
room
which
I
had
succeeded
in
filling
with
my
own
personality
until
*NL*
I
thought
no
more
of
the
room
than
of
myself
.
The
anaesthetic
effect
*NL*
of
custom
being
destroyed
,
I
would
begin
to
think
and
to
feel
very
*NL*
melancholy
things
.
The
door-handle
of
my
room
,
which
was
different
to
*NL*
me
from
all
the
other
doorhandles
in
the
world
,
inasmuch
as
it
seemed
to
*NL*
open
of
its
own
accord
and
without
my
having
to
turn
it
,
so
unconscious
*NL*
had
its
manipulation
become
;
lo
and
behold
,
it
was
now
an
astral
body
*NL*
for
Golo
.
And
as
soon
as
the
dinner-bell
rang
I
would
run
down
to
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
where
the
big
hanging
lamp
,
ignorant
of
Golo
and
Bluebeard
*NL*
but
well
acquainted
with
my
family
and
the
dish
of
stewed
beef
,
shed
the
*NL*
same
light
as
on
every
other
evening
;
and
I
would
fall
into
the
arms
of
*NL*
my
mother
,
whom
the
misfortunes
of
Geneviève
de
Brabant
had
made
all
the
*NL*
dearer
to
me
,
just
as
the
crimes
of
Golo
had
driven
me
to
a
more
than
*NL*
ordinarily
scrupulous
examination
of
my
own
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
dinner
,
alas
,
I
was
soon
obliged
to
leave
Mamma
,
who
stayed
*NL*
talking
with
the
others
,
in
the
garden
if
it
was
fine
,
or
in
the
little
*NL*
parlour
where
everyone
took
shelter
when
it
was
wet
.
Everyone
except
my
*NL*
grandmother
,
who
held
that
``
It
is
a
pity
to
shut
oneself
indoors
in
the
*NL*
country
,
''
and
used
to
carry
on
endless
discussions
with
my
father
on
the
*NL*
very
wettest
days
,
because
he
would
send
me
up
to
my
room
with
a
book
*NL*
instead
of
letting
me
stay
out
of
doors
.
``
That
is
not
the
way
to
make
*NL*
him
strong
and
active
,
''
she
would
say
sadly
,
``
especially
this
little
*NL*
man
,
who
needs
all
the
strength
and
character
that
he
can
get
.
''
My
*NL*
father
would
shrug
his
shoulders
and
study
the
barometer
,
for
he
took
an
*NL*
interest
in
meteorology
,
while
my
mother
,
keeping
very
quiet
so
as
not
*NL*
to
disturb
him
,
looked
at
him
with
tender
respect
,
but
not
too
hard
,
*NL*
not
wishing
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
of
his
superior
mind
.
But
my
*NL*
grandmother
,
in
all
weathers
,
even
when
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
*NL*
torrents
and
Françoise
had
rushed
indoors
with
the
precious
wicker
*NL*
armchairs
,
so
that
they
should
not
get
soaked
--
you
would
see
my
*NL*
grandmother
pacing
the
deserted
garden
,
lashed
by
the
storm
,
pushing
*NL*
back
her
grey
hair
in
disorder
so
that
her
brows
might
be
more
free
to
*NL*
imbibe
the
life-giving
draughts
of
wind
and
rain
.
She
would
say
,
``
At
*NL*
last
one
can
breathe
!
''
and
would
run
up
and
down
the
soaking
paths
--
too
*NL*
straight
and
symmetrical
for
her
liking
,
owing
to
the
want
of
any
*NL*
feeling
for
nature
in
the
new
gardener
,
whom
my
father
had
been
asking
*NL*
all
morning
if
the
weather
were
going
to
improve
--
with
her
keen
,
jerky
*NL*
little
step
regulated
by
the
various
effects
wrought
upon
her
soul
by
*NL*
the
intoxication
of
the
storm
,
the
force
of
hygiene
,
the
stupidity
of
*NL*
my
education
and
of
symmetry
in
gardens
,
rather
than
by
any
anxiety
-LRB-
for
*NL*
that
was
quite
unknown
to
her
-RRB-
to
save
her
plum-coloured
skirt
from
the
*NL*
spots
of
mud
under
which
it
would
gradually
disappear
to
a
depth
which
*NL*
always
provided
her
maid
with
a
fresh
problem
and
filled
her
with
fresh
*NL*
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
walks
of
my
grandmother
's
took
place
after
dinner
there
was
*NL*
one
thing
which
never
failed
to
bring
her
back
to
the
house
:
that
was
if
*NL*
-LRB-
at
one
of
those
points
when
the
revolutions
of
her
course
brought
her
,
*NL*
moth-like
,
in
sight
of
the
lamp
in
the
little
parlour
where
the
liqueurs
*NL*
were
set
out
on
the
card-table
-RRB-
my
great-aunt
called
out
to
her
:
*NL*
``
Bathilde
!
Come
in
and
stop
your
husband
from
drinking
brandy
!
''
For
,
*NL*
simply
to
tease
her
-LRB-
she
had
brought
so
foreign
a
type
of
mind
into
my
*NL*
father
's
family
that
everyone
made
a
joke
of
it
-RRB-
,
my
great-aunt
used
to
*NL*
make
my
grandfather
,
who
was
forbidden
liqueurs
,
take
just
a
few
drops
.
*NL*
My
poor
grandmother
would
come
in
and
beg
and
implore
her
husband
not
to
*NL*
taste
the
brandy
;
and
he
would
become
annoyed
and
swallow
his
few
drops
*NL*
all
the
same
,
and
she
would
go
out
again
sad
and
discouraged
,
but
still
*NL*
smiling
,
for
she
was
so
humble
and
so
sweet
that
her
gentleness
towards
*NL*
others
,
and
her
continual
subordination
of
herself
and
of
her
own
*NL*
troubles
,
appeared
on
her
face
blended
in
a
smile
which
,
unlike
those
*NL*
seen
on
the
majority
of
human
faces
,
had
no
trace
in
it
of
irony
,
save
*NL*
for
herself
,
while
for
all
of
us
kisses
seemed
to
spring
from
her
eyes
,
*NL*
which
could
not
look
upon
those
she
loved
without
yearning
to
bestow
*NL*
upon
them
passionate
caresses
.
The
torments
inflicted
on
her
by
my
*NL*
great-aunt
,
the
sight
of
my
grandmother
's
vain
entreaties
,
of
her
in
*NL*
her
weakness
conquered
before
she
began
,
but
still
making
the
futile
*NL*
endeavour
to
wean
my
grandfather
from
his
liqueur-glass
--
all
these
*NL*
were
things
of
the
sort
to
which
,
in
later
years
,
one
can
grow
so
well
*NL*
accustomed
as
to
smile
at
them
,
to
take
the
tormentor
's
side
with
a.
*NL*
happy
determination
which
deludes
one
into
the
belief
that
it
is
not
,
*NL*
really
,
tormenting
;
but
in
those
days
they
filled
me
with
such
horror
*NL*
that
I
longed
to
strike
my
great-aunt
.
And
yet
,
as
soon
as
I
heard
her
*NL*
``
Bathilde
!
Come
in
and
stop
your
husband
from
drinking
brandy
!
''
in
my
*NL*
cowardice
I
became
at
once
a
man
,
and
did
what
all
we
grown
men
do
when
*NL*
face
to
face
with
suffering
and
injustice
;
I
preferred
not
to
see
them
;
*NL*
I
ran
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
to
cry
by
myself
in
a
little
room
*NL*
beside
the
schoolroom
and
beneath
the
roof
,
which
smelt
of
orris-root
,
*NL*
and
was
scented
also
by
a
wild
currant-bush
which
had
climbed
up
between
*NL*
the
stones
of
the
outer
wall
and
thrust
a
flowering
branch
in
through
*NL*
the
half-opened
window
.
Intended
for
a
more
special
and
a
baser
use
,
*NL*
this
room
,
from
which
,
in
the
daytime
,
I
could
see
as
far
as
the
keep
of
*NL*
Roussainville-le-Pin
,
was
for
a
long
time
my
place
of
refuge
,
doubtless
*NL*
because
it
was
the
only
room
whose
door
Ï
was
allowed
to
lock
,
whenever
*NL*
my
occupation
was
such
as
required
an
inviolable
solitude
;
reading
or
*NL*
dreaming
,
secret
tears
or
paroxysms
of
desire
.
Alas
!
I
little
knew
*NL*
that
my
own
lack
of
will-power
,
my
delicate
health
,
and
the
consequent
*NL*
uncertainty
as
to
my
future
weighed
far
more
heavily
on
my
grandmother
's
*NL*
mind
than
any
little
breach
of
the
rules
by
her
husband
,
during
those
*NL*
endless
perambulations
,
afternoon
and
evening
,
in
which
we
used
to
see
*NL*
passing
up
and
down
,
obliquely
raised
towards
the
heavens
,
her
handsome
*NL*
face
with
its
brown
and
wrinkled
cheeks
,
which
with
age
had
acquired
*NL*
almost
the
purple
hue
of
tilled
fields
in
autumn
,
covered
,
if
she
were
*NL*
walking
abroad
,
by
a
half-lifted
veil
,
while
upon
them
either
the
*NL*
cold
or
some
sad
reflection
invariably
left
the
drying
traces
of
an
*NL*
involuntary
tear
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
sole
consolation
when
I
went
upstairs
for
the
night
was
that
Mamma
*NL*
would
come
in
and
kiss
me
after
I
was
in
bed
.
But
this
good
night
lasted
*NL*
for
so
short
a
time
:
she
went
down
again
so
soon
that
the
moment
in
*NL*
which
I
heard
her
climb
the
stairs
,
and
then
caught
the
sound
of
her
*NL*
garden
dress
of
blue
muslin
,
from
which
hung
little
tassels
of
plaited
*NL*
straw
,
rustling
along
the
double-doored
corridor
,
was
for
me
a
moment
*NL*
of
the
keenest
sorrow
.
So
much
did
I
love
that
good
night
that
I
reached
*NL*
the
stage
of
hoping
that
it
would
come
as
late
as
possible
,
so
as
*NL*
to
prolong
the
time
of
respite
during
which
Mamma
would
not
yet
have
*NL*
appeared
.
Sometimes
when
,
after
kissing
me
,
she
opened
the
door
to
go
,
I
*NL*
longed
to
call
her
back
,
to
say
to
her
``
Kiss
me
just
once
again
,
''
but
*NL*
I
knew
that
then
she
would
at
once
look
displeased
,
for
the
concession
*NL*
which
she
made
to
my
wretchedness
and
agitation
in
coming
up
to
me
with
*NL*
this
kiss
of
peace
always
annoyed
my
father
,
who
thought
such
ceremonies
*NL*
absurd
,
and
she
would
have
liked
to
try
to
induce
me
to
outgrow
the
*NL*
need
,
the
custom
of
having
her
there
at
all
,
which
was
a
very
different
*NL*
thing
from
letting
the
custom
grow
up
of
my
asking
her
for
an
additional
*NL*
kiss
when
she
was
already
crossing
the
threshold
.
And
to
see
her
look
*NL*
displeased
destroyed
all
the
sense
of
tranquillity
she
had
brought
me
a
*NL*
moment
before
,
when
she
bent
her
loving
face
down
over
my
bed
,
and
held
*NL*
it
out
to
me
like
a
Host
,
for
an
act
of
Communion
in
which
my
lips
might
*NL*
drink
deeply
the
sense
of
her
real
presence
,
and
with
it
the
power
to
*NL*
sleep
.
But
those
evenings
on
which
Mamma
stayed
so
short
a
time
in
*NL*
my
room
were
sweet
indeed
compared
to
those
on
which
we
had
guests
*NL*
to
dinner
,
and
therefore
she
did
not
come
at
all
.
Our
`
guests
'
*NL*
were
practically
limited
to
M.
Swann
,
who
,
apart
from
a
few
passing
*NL*
strangers
,
was
almost
the
only
person
who
ever
came
to
the
house
at
*NL*
Combray
,
sometimes
to
a
neighbourly
dinner
-LRB-
but
less
frequently
since
*NL*
his
unfortunate
marriage
,
as
my
family
did
not
care
to
receive
his
wife
-RRB-
*NL*
and
sometimes
after
dinner
,
uninvited
.
On
those
evenings
when
,
as
we
sat
*NL*
in
front
of
the
house
beneath
the
big
chestnut-tree
and
round
the
iron
*NL*
table
,
we
heard
,
from
the
far
end
of
the
garden
,
not
the
large
and
*NL*
noisy
rattle
which
heralded
and
deafened
as
he
approached
with
its
*NL*
ferruginous
,
interminable
,
frozen
sound
any
member
of
the
household
who
*NL*
had
put
it
out
of
action
by
coming
in
`
without
ringing
,
'
but
the
double
*NL*
peal
--
timid
,
oval
,
gilded
--
of
the
visitors
'
bell
,
everyone
would
at
once
*NL*
exclaim
``
A
visitor
!
Who
in
the
world
can
it
be
?
''
but
they
knew
quite
*NL*
well
that
it
could
only
be
M.
Swann
.
My
great-aunt
,
speaking
in
a
loud
*NL*
voice
,
to
set
an
example
,
in
a
tone
which
she
endeavoured
to
make
sound
*NL*
natural
,
would
tell
the
others
not
to
whisper
so
;
that
nothing
could
be
*NL*
more
unpleasant
for
a
stranger
coming
in
,
who
would
be
led
to
think
that
*NL*
people
were
saying
things
about
him
which
he
was
not
meant
to
hear
;
and
*NL*
then
my
grandmother
would
be
sent
out
as
a
scout
,
always
happy
to
find
*NL*
an
excuse
for
an
additional
turn
in
the
garden
,
which
she
would
utilise
*NL*
to
remove
surreptitiously
,
as
she
passed
,
the
stakes
of
a
rose-tree
or
*NL*
two
,
so
as
to
make
the
roses
look
a
little
more
natural
,
as
a
mother
*NL*
might
run
her
hand
through
her
boy
's
hair
,
after
the
barber
had
smoothed
*NL*
it
down
,
to
make
it
stick
out
properly
round
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
we
would
all
stay
,
hanging
on
the
words
which
would
fall
from
*NL*
my
grandmother
's
lips
when
she
brought
us
back
her
report
of
the
*NL*
enemy
,
as
though
there
had
been
some
uncertainty
among
a
vast
number
of
*NL*
possible
invaders
,
and
then
,
soon
after
,
my
grandfather
would
say
:
``
I
*NL*
can
hear
Swann
's
voice
.
''
And
,
indeed
,
one
could
tell
him
only
by
his
*NL*
voice
,
for
it
was
difficult
to
make
out
his
face
with
its
arched
nose
*NL*
and
green
eyes
,
under
a
high
forehead
fringed
with
fair
,
almost
red
*NL*
hair
,
dressed
in
the
Bressant
style
,
because
in
the
garden
we
used
as
*NL*
little
light
as
possible
,
so
as
not
to
attract
mosquitoes
:
and
I
would
*NL*
slip
away
as
though
not
going
for
anything
in
particular
,
to
tell
them
*NL*
to
bring
out
the
syrups
;
for
my
grandmother
made
a
great
point
,
thinking
*NL*
it
`
nicer
'
of
their
not
being
allowed
to
seem
anything
out
of
the
*NL*
ordinary
,
which
we
kept
for
visitors
only
.
Although
a
far
younger
man
,
*NL*
M.
Swann
was
very
much
attached
to
my
grandfather
,
who
had
been
an
*NL*
intimate
friend
,
in
his
time
,
of
Swann
's
father
,
an
excellent
but
an
*NL*
eccentric
man
in
whom
the
least
little
thing
would
,
it
seemed
,
often
*NL*
check
the
flow
of
his
spirits
and
divert
the
current
of
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
Several
times
in
the
course
of
a
year
I
would
hear
my
grandfather
tell
*NL*
at
table
the
story
,
which
never
varied
,
of
the
behaviour
of
M.
Swann
the
*NL*
elder
upon
the
death
of
his
wife
,
by
whose
bedside
he
had
watched
*NL*
day
and
night
.
My
grandfather
,
who
had
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
hastened
to
join
him
at
the
Swanns
'
family
property
on
the
outskirts
of
*NL*
Combray
,
and
managed
to
entice
him
for
a
moment
,
weeping
profusely
,
out
*NL*
of
the
death-chamber
,
so
that
he
should
not
be
present
when
the
body
was
*NL*
laid
in
its
coffin
.
They
took
a
turn
or
two
in
the
park
,
where
there
was
*NL*
a
little
sunshine
.
Suddenly
M.
Swann
seized
my
grandfather
by
the
arm
*NL*
and
cried
,
``
Oh
,
my
dear
old
friend
,
how
fortunate
we
are
to
be
walking
*NL*
here
together
on
such
a
charming
day
!
Do
n't
you
see
how
pretty
they
are
,
*NL*
all
these
trees
--
my
hawthorns
,
and
my
new
pond
,
on
which
you
have
never
*NL*
congratulated
me
?
You
look
as
glum
as
a
night-cap
.
Do
n't
you
feel
this
*NL*
little
breeze
?
Ah
!
whatever
you
may
say
,
it
's
good
to
be
alive
all
the
*NL*
same
,
my
dear
Amédée
!
''
And
then
,
abruptly
,
the
memory
of
his
dead
wife
*NL*
returned
to
him
,
and
probably
thinking
it
too
complicated
to
inquire
*NL*
into
how
,
at
such
a
time
,
he
could
have
allowed
himself
to
be
carried
*NL*
away
by
an
impulse
of
happiness
,
he
confined
himself
to
a
gesture
which
*NL*
he
habitually
employed
whenever
any
perplexing
question
came
into
his
*NL*
mind
:
that
is
,
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
,
dried
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
wiped
his
glasses
.
And
he
could
never
be
consoled
for
the
loss
of
*NL*
his
wife
,
but
used
to
say
to
my
grandfather
,
during
the
two
years
for
*NL*
which
he
survived
her
,
``
It
's
a
funny
thing
,
now
;
I
very
often
think
*NL*
of
my
poor
wife
,
but
I
can
not
think
of
her
very
much
at
any
one
time
.
''
*NL*
``
Often
,
but
a
little
at
a
time
,
like
poor
old
Swann
,
''
became
one
of
my
*NL*
grandfather
's
favourite
phrases
,
which
he
would
apply
to
all
kinds
of
*NL*
things
.
And
I
should
have
assumed
that
this
father
of
Swann
's
had
been
*NL*
a
monster
if
my
grandfather
,
whom
I
regarded
as
a
better
judge
than
*NL*
myself
,
and
whose
word
was
my
law
and
often
led
me
in
the
long
run
to
*NL*
pardon
offences
which
I
should
have
been
inclined
to
condemn
,
had
not
*NL*
gone
on
to
exclaim
,
``
But
,
after
all
,
he
had
a
heart
of
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
years
,
albeit
--
and
especially
before
his
marriage
--
M.
Swann
*NL*
the
younger
came
often
to
see
them
at
Combray
,
my
great-aunt
and
*NL*
grandparents
never
suspected
that
he
had
entirely
ceased
to
live
in
the
*NL*
kind
of
society
which
his
family
had
frequented
,
or
that
,
under
the
*NL*
sort
of
incognito
which
the
name
of
Swann
gave
him
among
us
,
they
were
*NL*
harbouring
--
with
the
complete
innocence
of
a
family
of
honest
innkeepers
*NL*
who
have
in
their
midst
some
distinguished
highwayman
and
never
know
*NL*
it
--
one
of
the
smartest
members
of
the
Jockey
Club
,
a
particular
friend
*NL*
of
the
Comte
de
Paris
and
of
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
and
one
of
the
*NL*
men
most
sought
after
in
the
aristocratic
world
of
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Germain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
utter
ignorance
of
the
brilliant
part
which
Swann
was
playing
in
*NL*
the
world
of
fashion
was
,
of
course
,
due
in
part
to
his
own
reserve
and
*NL*
discretion
,
but
also
to
the
fact
that
middle-class
people
in
those
days
*NL*
took
what
was
almost
a
Hindu
view
of
society
,
which
they
held
to
consist
*NL*
of
sharply
defined
castes
,
so
that
everyone
at
his
birth
found
himself
*NL*
called
to
that
station
in
life
which
his
parents
already
occupied
,
*NL*
and
nothing
,
except
the
chance
of
a
brilliant
career
or
of
a
`
good
'
*NL*
marriage
,
could
extract
you
from
that
station
or
admit
you
to
a
superior
*NL*
caste
.
M.
Swann
,
the
father
,
had
been
a
stockbroker
;
and
so
`
young
*NL*
Swann
'
found
himself
immured
for
life
in
a
caste
where
one
's
fortune
,
as
*NL*
in
a
list
of
taxpayers
,
varied
between
such
and
such
limits
of
income
.
*NL*
We
knew
the
people
with
whom
his
father
had
associated
,
and
so
we
knew
*NL*
his
own
associates
,
the
people
with
whom
he
was
`
in
a
position
to
mix
.
'
*NL*
If
he
knew
other
people
besides
,
those
were
youthful
acquaintances
on
*NL*
whom
the
old
friends
of
the
family
,
like
my
relatives
,
shut
their
eyes
*NL*
all
the
more
good-naturedly
that
Swann
himself
,
after
he
was
left
an
*NL*
orphan
,
still
came
most
faithfully
to
see
us
;
but
we
would
have
been
*NL*
ready
to
wager
that
the
people
outside
our
acquaintance
whom
Swann
knew
*NL*
were
of
the
sort
to
whom
he
would
not
have
dared
to
raise
his
hat
,
had
*NL*
he
met
them
while
he
was
walking
with
ourselves
.
Had
there
been
such
a
*NL*
thing
as
a
determination
to
apply
to
Swann
a
social
coefficient
peculiar
*NL*
to
himself
,
as
distinct
from
all
the
other
sons
of
other
stockbrokers
in
*NL*
his
father
's
position
,
his
coefficient
would
have
been
rather
lower
than
*NL*
theirs
,
because
,
leading
a
very
simple
life
,
and
having
always
had
*NL*
a
craze
for
`
antiques
'
and
pictures
,
he
now
lived
and
piled
up
his
*NL*
collections
in
an
old
house
which
my
grandmother
longed
to
visit
,
*NL*
but
which
stood
on
the
Quai
d'Orléans
,
a
neighbourhood
in
which
my
*NL*
great-aunt
thought
it
most
degrading
to
be
quartered
.
``
Are
you
really
*NL*
a
connoisseur
,
now
?
''
she
would
say
to
him
;
``
I
ask
for
your
own
sake
,
as
*NL*
you
are
likely
to
have
`
fakes
'
palmed
off
on
you
by
the
dealers
,
''
for
*NL*
she
did
not
,
in
fact
,
endow
him
with
any
critical
faculty
,
and
had
no
*NL*
great
opinion
of
the
intelligence
of
a
man
who
,
in
conversation
,
would
*NL*
avoid
serious
topics
and
shewed
a
very
dull
preciseness
,
not
only
when
*NL*
he
gave
us
kitchen
recipes
,
going
into
the
most
minute
details
,
but
*NL*
even
when
my
grandmother
's
sisters
were
talking
to
him
about
art
.
When
*NL*
challenged
by
them
to
give
an
opinion
,
or
to
express
his
admiration
for
*NL*
some
picture
,
he
would
remain
almost
impolitely
silent
,
and
would
then
*NL*
make
amends
by
furnishing
-LRB-
if
he
could
-RRB-
some
fact
or
other
about
the
*NL*
gallery
in
which
the
picture
was
hung
,
or
the
date
at
which
it
had
been
*NL*
painted
.
But
as
a
rule
he
would
content
himself
with
trying
to
amuse
*NL*
us
by
telling
us
the
story
of
his
latest
adventure
--
and
he
would
have
*NL*
a
fresh
story
for
us
on
every
occasion
--
with
some
one
whom
we
ourselves
*NL*
knew
,
such
as
the
Combray
chemist
,
or
our
cook
,
or
our
coachman
.
These
*NL*
stories
certainly
used
to
make
my
great-aunt
laugh
,
but
she
could
*NL*
never
tell
whether
that
was
on
account
of
the
absurd
parts
which
Swann
*NL*
invariably
made
himself
play
in
the
adventures
,
or
of
the
wit
that
he
*NL*
shewed
in
telling
us
of
them
.
``
It
is
easy
to
see
that
you
are
a
regular
*NL*
`
character
,
'
M.
Swann
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
the
only
member
of
our
family
who
could
be
described
as
a
*NL*
trifle
`
common
,
'
she
would
always
take
care
to
remark
to
strangers
,
when
*NL*
Swann
was
mentioned
,
that
he
could
easily
,
if
he
had
wished
to
,
have
*NL*
lived
in
the
Boulevard
Haussmann
or
the
Avenue
de
l'Opéra
,
and
that
*NL*
he
was
the
son
of
old
M.
Swann
who
must
have
left
four
or
five
million
*NL*
francs
,
but
that
it
was
a
fad
of
his
.
A
fad
which
,
moreover
,
she
thought
*NL*
was
bound
to
amuse
other
people
so
much
that
in
Paris
,
when
M.
Swann
*NL*
called
on
New
Year
's
Day
bringing
her
a
little
packet
of
_
marrons
*NL*
glacés
_
,
she
never
failed
,
if
there
were
strangers
in
the
room
,
to
say
*NL*
to
him
:
``
Well
,
M.
Swann
,
and
do
you
still
live
next
door
to
the
Bonded
*NL*
Vaults
,
so
as
to
be
sure
of
not
missing
your
train
when
you
go
to
*NL*
Lyons
?
''
and
she
would
peep
out
of
the
corner
of
her
eye
,
over
her
*NL*
glasses
,
at
the
other
visitors
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
anyone
had
suggested
to
my
aunt
that
this
Swann
,
who
,
in
his
*NL*
capacity
as
the
son
of
old
M.
Swann
,
was
`
fully
qualified
'
to
be
*NL*
received
by
any
of
the
`
upper
middle
class
,
'
the
most
respected
*NL*
barristers
and
solicitors
of
Paris
-LRB-
though
he
was
perhaps
a
trifle
*NL*
inclined
to
let
this
hereditary
privilege
go
into
abeyance
-RRB-
,
had
another
*NL*
almost
secret
existence
of
a
wholly
different
kind
:
that
when
he
left
*NL*
our
house
in
Paris
,
saying
that
he
must
go
home
to
bed
,
he
would
no
*NL*
sooner
have
turned
the
corner
than
he
would
stop
,
retrace
his
steps
,
and
*NL*
be
off
to
some
drawing-room
on
whose
like
no
stockbroker
or
associate
*NL*
of
stockbrokers
had
ever
set
eyes
--
that
would
have
seemed
to
my
aunt
*NL*
as
extraordinary
as
,
to
a
woman
of
wider
reading
,
the
thought
of
being
*NL*
herself
on
terms
of
intimacy
with
Aristaeus
,
of
knowing
that
he
would
,
*NL*
when
he
had
finished
his
conversation
with
her
,
plunge
deep
into
the
*NL*
realms
of
Thetis
,
into
an
empire
veiled
from
mortal
eyes
,
in
which
*NL*
Virgil
depicts
him
as
being
received
with
open
arms
;
or
--
to
be
content
*NL*
with
an
image
more
likely
to
have
occurred
to
her
,
for
she
had
seen
it
*NL*
painted
on
the
plates
we
used
for
biscuits
at
Combray
--
as
the
thought
*NL*
of
having
had
to
dinner
Ali
Baba
,
who
,
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
alone
*NL*
and
unobserved
,
would
make
his
way
into
the
cave
,
resplendent
with
its
*NL*
unsuspected
treasures
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
he
had
come
to
see
us
after
dinner
in
Paris
,
and
had
begged
*NL*
pardon
for
being
in
evening
clothes
,
Françoise
,
when
he
had
gone
,
told
*NL*
us
that
she
had
got
it
from
his
coachman
that
he
had
been
dining
``
with
a
*NL*
princess
.
''
``
A
pretty
sort
of
princess
,
''
drawled
my
aunt
;
``
I
know
*NL*
them
,
''
and
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
without
raising
her
eyes
from
her
*NL*
knitting
,
serenely
ironical
.
*NL*
*NL*
Altogether
,
my
aunt
used
to
treat
him
with
scant
ceremony
.
Since
she
was
*NL*
of
the
opinion
that
he
ought
to
feel
flattered
by
our
invitations
,
she
*NL*
thought
it
only
right
and
proper
that
he
should
never
come
to
see
us
in
*NL*
summer
without
a
basket
of
peaches
or
raspberries
from
his
garden
,
*NL*
and
that
from
each
of
his
visits
to
Italy
he
should
bring
back
some
*NL*
photographs
of
old
masters
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
quite
natural
,
therefore
,
to
send
to
him
whenever
we
wanted
*NL*
a
recipe
for
some
special
sauce
or
for
a
pineapple
salad
for
one
of
*NL*
our
big
dinner-parties
,
to
which
he
himself
would
not
be
invited
,
not
*NL*
seeming
of
sufficient
importance
to
be
served
up
to
new
friends
who
*NL*
might
be
in
our
house
for
the
first
time
.
If
the
conversation
turned
*NL*
upon
the
Princes
of
the
House
of
France
,
``
Gentlemen
,
you
and
I
will
*NL*
never
know
,
will
we
,
and
do
n't
want
to
,
do
we
?
''
my
great-aunt
would
*NL*
say
tartly
to
Swann
,
who
had
,
perhaps
,
a
letter
from
Twickenham
in
his
*NL*
pocket
;
she
would
make
him
play
accompaniments
and
turn
over
music
on
*NL*
evenings
when
my
grandmother
's
sister
sang
;
manipulating
this
creature
,
*NL*
so
rare
and
refined
at
other
times
and
in
other
places
,
with
the
rough
*NL*
simplicity
of
a
child
who
will
play
with
some
curio
from
the
cabinet
no
*NL*
more
carefully
than
if
it
were
a
penny
toy
.
Certainly
the
Swann
who
was
*NL*
a
familiar
figure
in
all
the
clubs
of
those
days
differed
hugely
from
,
*NL*
the
Swann
created
in
my
great-aunt
's
mind
when
,
of
an
evening
,
in
our
*NL*
little
garden
at
Combray
,
after
the
two
shy
peals
had
sounded
from
the
*NL*
gate
,
she
would
vitalise
,
by
injecting
into
it
everything
she
had
ever
*NL*
heard
about
the
Swann
family
,
the
vague
and
unrecognisable
shape
which
*NL*
began
to
appear
,
with
my
grandmother
in
its
wake
,
against
a
background
*NL*
of
shadows
,
and
could
at
last
be
identified
by
the
sound
of
its
voice
.
*NL*
But
then
,
even
in
the
most
insignificant
details
of
our
daily
life
,
none
*NL*
of
us
can
be
said
to
constitute
a
material
whole
,
which
is
identical
for
*NL*
everyone
,
and
need
only
be
turned
up
like
a
page
in
an
account-book
or
*NL*
the
record
of
a
will
;
our
social
personality
is
created
by
the
thoughts
*NL*
of
other
people
.
Even
the
simple
act
which
we
describe
as
``
seeing
some
*NL*
one
we
know
''
is
,
to
some
extent
,
an
intellectual
process
.
We
pack
the
*NL*
physical
outline
of
the
creature
we
see
with
all
the
ideas
we
have
*NL*
already
formed
about
him
,
and
in
the
complete
picture
of
him
which
we
*NL*
compose
in
our
minds
those
ideas
have
certainly
the
principal
place
.
In
*NL*
the
end
they
come
to
fill
out
so
completely
the
curve
of
his
cheeks
,
to
*NL*
follow
so
exactly
the
line
of
his
nose
,
they
blend
so
harmoniously
in
*NL*
the
sound
of
his
voice
that
these
seem
to
be
no
more
than
a
transparent
*NL*
envelope
,
so
that
each
time
we
see
the
face
or
hear
the
voice
it
is
our
*NL*
own
ideas
of
him
which
we
recognise
and
to
which
we
listen
.
And
so
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
from
the
Swann
they
had
built
up
for
their
own
purposes
my
family
*NL*
had
left
out
,
in
their
ignorance
,
a
whole
crowd
of
the
details
of
his
*NL*
daily
life
in
the
world
of
fashion
,
details
by
means
of
which
other
*NL*
people
,
when
they
met
him
,
saw
all
the
Graces
enthroned
in
his
face
and
*NL*
stopping
at
the
line
of
his
arched
nose
as
at
a
natural
frontier
;
but
*NL*
they
contrived
also
to
put
into
a
face
from
which
its
distinction
had
*NL*
been
evicted
,
a
face
vacant
and
roomy
as
an
untenanted
house
,
to
plant
*NL*
in
the
depths
of
its
unvalued
eyes
a
lingering
sense
,
uncertain
but
not
*NL*
unpleasing
,
half-memory
and
half-oblivion
,
of
idle
hours
spent
together
*NL*
after
our
weekly
dinners
,
round
the
card-table
or
in
the
garden
,
during
*NL*
our
companionable
country
life
.
Our
friend
's
bodily
frame
had
been
so
*NL*
well
lined
with
this
sense
,
and
with
various
earlier
memories
of
his
*NL*
family
,
that
their
own
special
Swann
had
become
to
my
people
a
complete
*NL*
and
living
creature
;
so
that
even
now
I
have
the
feeling
of
leaving
*NL*
some
one
I
know
for
another
quite
different
person
when
,
going
back
in
*NL*
memory
,
I
pass
from
the
Swann
whom
I
knew
later
and
more
intimately
*NL*
to
this
early
Swann
--
this
early
Swann
in
whom
I
can
distinguish
the
*NL*
charming
mistakes
of
my
childhood
,
and
who
,
incidentally
,
is
less
like
*NL*
his
successor
than
he
is
like
the
other
people
I
knew
at
that
time
,
as
*NL*
though
one
's
life
were
a
series
of
galleries
in
which
all
the
portraits
*NL*
of
any
one
period
had
a
marked
family
likeness
,
the
same
-LRB-
so
to
speak
-RRB-
*NL*
tonality
--
this
early
Swann
abounding
in
leisure
,
fragrant
with
the
scent
*NL*
of
the
great
chestnut-tree
,
of
baskets
of
raspberries
and
of
a
sprig
of
*NL*
tarragon
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
one
day
,
when
my
grandmother
had
gone
to
ask
some
favour
of
a
*NL*
lady
whom
she
had
known
at
the
Sacré
Coeur
-LRB-
and
with
whom
,
because
of
*NL*
our
caste
theory
,
she
had
not
cared
to
keep
up
any
degree
of
intimacy
in
*NL*
spite
of
several
common
interests
-RRB-
,
the
Marquise
de
Villeparisis
,
of
the
*NL*
famous
house
of
Bouillon
,
this
lady
had
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
know
M.
Swann
very
well
;
he
is
a
great
friend
of
my
*NL*
nephews
,
the
des
Laumes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
had
returned
from
the
call
full
of
praise
for
the
house
,
*NL*
which
overlooked
some
gardens
,
and
in
which
Mme.
de
Villeparisis
had
*NL*
advised
her
to
rent
a
flat
;
and
also
for
a
repairing
tailor
and
his
*NL*
daughter
,
who
kept
a
little
shop
in
the
courtyard
,
into
which
she
had
*NL*
gone
to
ask
them
to
put
a
stitch
in
her
skirt
,
which
she
had
torn
on
the
*NL*
staircase
.
My
grandmother
had
found
these
people
perfectly
charming
:
the
*NL*
girl
,
she
said
,
was
a
jewel
,
and
the
tailor
a
most
distinguished
man
,
*NL*
the
finest
she
had
ever
seen
.
For
in
her
eyes
distinction
was
a
thing
*NL*
wholly
independent
of
social
position
.
She
was
in
ecstasies
over
some
*NL*
answer
the
tailor
had
made
,
saying
to
Mamma
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sévigné
would
not
have
said
it
better
!
''
and
,
by
way
of
contrast
,
of
a
*NL*
nephew
of
Mme.
de
Villeparisis
whom
she
had
met
at
the
house
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
he
is
so
common
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
effect
of
that
remark
about
Swann
had
been
,
not
to
raise
him
*NL*
in
my
great-aunt
's
estimation
,
but
to
lower
Mme.
de
Villeparisis
.
It
*NL*
appeared
that
the
deference
which
,
on
my
grandmother
's
authority
,
we
*NL*
owed
to
Mme.
de
Villeparisis
imposed
on
her
the
reciprocal
obligation
to
*NL*
do
nothing
that
would
render
her
less
worthy
of
our
regard
,
and
that
*NL*
she
had
failed
in
her
duty
in
becoming
aware
of
Swann
's
existence
and
*NL*
in
allowing
members
of
her
family
to
associate
with
him
.
``
How
should
*NL*
she
know
Swann
?
A
lady
who
,
you
always
made
out
,
was
related
to
Marshal
*NL*
MacMahon
!
''
This
view
of
Swann
's
social
atmosphere
which
prevailed
in
my
*NL*
family
seemed
to
be
confirmed
later
on
by
his
marriage
with
a
woman
of
*NL*
the
worst
class
,
you
might
almost
say
a
`
fast
'
woman
,
whom
,
to
do
him
*NL*
justice
,
he
never
attempted
to
introduce
to
us
,
for
he
continued
to
come
*NL*
to
us
alone
,
though
he
came
more
and
more
seldom
;
but
from
whom
they
*NL*
thought
they
could
establish
,
on
the
assumption
that
he
had
found
her
*NL*
there
,
the
circle
,
unknown
to
them
,
in
which
he
ordinarily
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
one
occasion
my
grandfather
read
in
a
newspaper
that
M.
Swann
was
*NL*
one
of
the
most
faithful
attendants
at
the
Sunday
luncheons
given
by
the
*NL*
Duc
de
X
--
,
whose
father
and
uncle
had
been
among
our
most
prominent
*NL*
statesmen
in
the
reign
of
Louis
Philippe
.
Now
my
grandfather
was
curious
*NL*
to
learn
all
the
little
details
which
might
help
him
to
take
a
mental
*NL*
share
in
the
private
lives
of
men
like
Mole
,
the
Duc
Pasquier
,
or
the
*NL*
Duc
de
Broglie
.
He
was
delighted
to
find
that
Swann
associated
with
*NL*
people
who
had
known
them
.
My
great-aunt
,
however
,
interpreted
this
*NL*
piece
of
news
in
a
sense
discreditable
to
Swann
;
for
anyone
who
chose
*NL*
his
associates
outside
the
caste
in
which
he
had
been
born
and
bred
,
*NL*
outside
his
`
proper
station
,
'
was
condemned
to
utter
degradation
in
her
*NL*
eyes
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
such
a
one
abdicated
all
claim
to
enjoy
the
*NL*
fruits
of
those
friendly
relations
with
people
of
good
position
which
*NL*
prudent
parents
cultivate
and
store
up
for
their
children
's
benefit
,
for
*NL*
my
great-aunt
had
actually
ceased
to
`
see
'
the
son
of
a
lawyer
we
*NL*
had
known
because
he
had
married
a
`
Highness
'
and
had
thereby
stepped
*NL*
down
--
in
her
eyes
--
from
the
respectable
position
of
a
lawyer
's
son
to
*NL*
that
of
those
adventurers
,
upstart
footmen
or
stable-boys
mostly
,
*NL*
to
whom
we
read
that
queens
have
sometimes
shewn
their
favours
.
She
*NL*
objected
,
therefore
,
to
my
grandfather
's
plan
of
questioning
Swann
,
when
*NL*
next
he
came
to
dine
with
us
,
about
these
people
whose
friendship
with
*NL*
him
we
had
discovered
.
On
the
other
hand
,
my
grandmother
's
two
sisters
,
*NL*
elderly
spinsters
who
shared
her
nobility
of
character
but
lacked
her
*NL*
intelligence
,
declared
that
they
could
not
conceive
what
pleasure
their
*NL*
brother-in-law
could
find
in
talking
about
such
trifles
.
They
were
*NL*
ladies
of
lofty
ambition
,
who
for
that
reason
were
incapable
of
taking
*NL*
the
least
interest
in
what
might
be
called
the
`
pinchbeck
'
things
of
*NL*
life
,
even
when
they
had
an
historic
value
,
or
,
generally
speaking
,
in
*NL*
anything
that
was
not
directly
associated
with
some
object
aesthetically
*NL*
precious
.
So
complete
was
their
negation
of
interest
in
anything
which
*NL*
seemed
directly
or
indirectly
a
part
of
our
everyday
life
that
their
*NL*
sense
of
hearing
--
which
had
gradually
come
to
understand
its
own
*NL*
futility
when
the
tone
of
the
conversation
,
at
the
dinner-table
,
became
*NL*
frivolous
or
merely
mundane
,
without
the
two
old
ladies
'
being
able
to
*NL*
guide
it
back
to
the
topic
dear
to
themselves
--
would
leave
its
receptive
*NL*
channels
unemployed
,
so
effectively
that
they
were
actually
becoming
*NL*
atrophied
.
So
that
if
my
grandfather
wished
to
attract
the
attention
of
*NL*
the
two
sisters
,
he
would
have
to
make
use
of
some
such
alarm
signals
*NL*
as
mad-doctors
adopt
in
dealing
with
their
distracted
patients
;
as
by
*NL*
beating
several
times
on
a
glass
with
the
blade
of
a
knife
,
fixing
them
*NL*
at
the
same
time
with
a
sharp
word
and
a
compelling
glance
,
violent
*NL*
methods
which
the
said
doctors
are
apt
to
bring
with
them
into
their
*NL*
everyday
life
among
the
sane
,
either
from
force
of
professional
habit
or
*NL*
because
they
think
the
whole
world
a
trifle
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
interest
grew
,
however
,
when
,
the
day
before
Swann
was
to
dine
*NL*
with
us
,
and
when
he
had
made
them
a
special
present
of
a
case
of
Asti
,
*NL*
my
great-aunt
,
who
had
in
her
hand
a
copy
of
the
_
Figaro
_
in
which
to
*NL*
the
name
of
a
picture
then
on
view
in
a
Corot
exhibition
were
added
the
*NL*
words
,
``
from
the
collection
of
M.
Charles
Swann
,
''
asked
:
``
Did
you
see
*NL*
that
Swann
is
`
mentioned
'
in
the
_
Figaro
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
always
told
you
,
''
said
my
grandmother
,
``
that
he
had
plenty
*NL*
of
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
,
of
course
,
''
retorted
my
great-aunt
,
``
say
anything
just
to
*NL*
seem
different
from
_
us
_
.
''
For
,
knowing
that
my
grandmother
never
agreed
*NL*
with
her
,
and
not
being
quite
confident
that
it
was
her
own
opinion
*NL*
which
the
rest
of
us
invariably
endorsed
,
she
wished
to
extort
from
us
*NL*
a
wholesale
condemnation
of
my
grandmother
's
views
,
against
which
she
*NL*
hoped
to
force
us
into
solidarity
with
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
sat
silent
.
My
grandmother
's
sisters
having
expressed
a
desire
*NL*
to
mention
to
Swann
this
reference
to
him
in
the
_
Figaro
_
,
my
great-aunt
*NL*
dissuaded
them
.
Whenever
she
saw
in
others
an
advantage
,
however
*NL*
trivial
,
which
she
herself
lacked
,
she
would
persuade
herself
that
it
*NL*
was
no
advantage
at
all
,
but
a
drawback
,
and
would
pity
so
as
not
to
*NL*
have
to
envy
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
that
would
please
him
at
all
;
I
know
very
well
,
I
should
*NL*
hate
to
see
my
name
printed
like
that
,
as
large
as
life
,
in
the
paper
,
*NL*
and
I
should
n't
feel
at
all
flattered
if
anyone
spoke
to
me
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
,
however
,
put
any
very
great
pressure
upon
my
grandmother
's
*NL*
sisters
,
for
they
,
in
their
horror
of
vulgarity
,
had
brought
to
such
a
*NL*
fine
art
the
concealment
of
a
personal
allusion
in
a
wealth
of
ingenious
*NL*
circumlocution
,
that
it
would
often
pass
unnoticed
even
by
the
person
*NL*
to
whom
it
was
addressed
.
As
for
my
mother
,
her
only
thought
was
of
*NL*
managing
to
induce
my
father
to
consent
to
speak
to
Swann
,
not
of
his
*NL*
wife
,
but
of
his
daughter
,
whom
he
worshipped
,
and
for
whose
sake
it
was
*NL*
understood
that
he
had
ultimately
made
his
unfortunate
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
only
say
a
word
;
just
ask
him
how
she
is
.
It
must
be
so
very
*NL*
hard
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
however
,
was
annoyed
:
``
No
,
no
;
you
have
the
most
absurd
*NL*
ideas
.
It
would
be
utterly
ridiculous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
only
one
of
us
in
whom
the
prospect
of
Swann
's
arrival
gave
*NL*
rise
to
an
unhappy
foreboding
was
myself
.
And
that
was
because
on
the
*NL*
evenings
when
there
were
visitors
,
or
just
M.
Swann
in
the
house
,
Mamma
*NL*
did
not
come
up
to
my
room
.
I
did
not
,
at
that
time
,
have
dinner
with
*NL*
the
family
:
I
came
out
to
the
garden
after
dinner
,
and
at
nine
I
said
*NL*
good
night
and
went
to
bed
.
But
on
these
evenings
I
used
to
dine
earlier
*NL*
than
the
others
,
and
to
come
in
afterwards
and
sit
at
table
until
eight
*NL*
o'clock
,
when
it
was
understood
that
I
must
go
upstairs
;
that
frail
and
*NL*
precious
kiss
which
Mamma
used
always
to
leave
upon
my
lips
when
I
*NL*
was
in
bed
and
just
going
to
sleep
I
had
to
take
with
me
from
the
*NL*
dining-room
to
my
own
,
and
to
keep
inviolate
all
the
time
that
it
*NL*
took
me
to
undress
,
without
letting
its
sweet
charm
be
broken
,
without
*NL*
letting
its
volatile
essence
diffuse
itself
and
evaporate
;
and
just
on
*NL*
those
very
evenings
when
I
must
needs
take
most
pains
to
receive
it
with
*NL*
due
formality
,
I
had
to
snatch
it
,
to
seize
it
instantly
and
in
public
,
*NL*
without
even
having
the
time
or
being
properly
free
to
apply
to
what
I
*NL*
was
doing
the
punctiliousness
which
madmen
use
who
compel
themselves
to
*NL*
exclude
all
other
thoughts
from
their
minds
while
they
are
shutting
a
*NL*
door
,
so
that
when
the
sickness
of
uncertainty
sweeps
over
them
again
*NL*
they
can
triumphantly
face
and
overcome
it
with
the
recollection
of
the
*NL*
precise
moment
in
which
the
door
was
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
all
in
the
garden
when
the
double
peal
of
the
gate-bell
sounded
*NL*
shyly
.
Everyone
knew
that
it
must
be
Swann
,
and
yet
they
looked
at
one
*NL*
another
inquiringly
and
sent
my
grandmother
scouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
that
you
thank
him
intelligibly
for
the
wine
,
''
my
grandfather
*NL*
warned
his
two
sisters-in-law
;
``
you
know
how
good
it
is
,
and
it
is
a
*NL*
huge
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
do
n't
start
whispering
!
''
said
my
great-aunt
.
``
How
would
you
like
*NL*
to
come
into
a
house
and
find
everyone
muttering
to
themselves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
There
's
M.
Swann
,
''
cried
my
father
.
``
Let
's
ask
him
if
he
thinks
it
*NL*
will
be
fine
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
fancied
that
a
word
from
her
would
wipe
out
all
the
*NL*
unpleasantness
which
my
family
had
contrived
to
make
Swann
feel
since
*NL*
his
marriage
.
She
found
an
opportunity
to
draw
him
aside
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
But
I
followed
her
:
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
let
her
go
out
of
reach
*NL*
of
me
while
I
felt
that
in
a
few
minutes
I
should
have
to
leave
her
in
*NL*
the
dining-room
and
go
up
to
my
bed
without
the
consoling
thought
,
as
on
*NL*
ordinary
evenings
,
that
she
would
come
up
,
later
,
to
kiss
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
M.
Swann
,
''
she
said
,
``
do
tell
me
about
your
daughter
;
I
am
sure
*NL*
she
shews
a
taste
already
for
nice
things
,
like
her
papa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
and
sit
down
here
with
us
all
on
the
verandah
,
''
said
my
*NL*
grandfather
,
coming
up
to
him
.
My
mother
had
to
abandon
the
quest
,
but
*NL*
managed
to
extract
from
the
restriction
itself
a
further
refinement
of
*NL*
thought
,
as
great
poets
do
when
the
tyranny
of
rhyme
forces
them
into
*NL*
the
discovery
of
their
finest
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
talk
about
her
again
when
we
are
by
ourselves
,
''
she
said
,
or
*NL*
rather
whispered
to
Swann
.
``
It
is
only
a
mother
who
can
understand
.
I
am
*NL*
sure
that
hers
would
agree
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
we
all
sat
down
round
the
iron
table
.
I
should
have
liked
not
*NL*
to
think
of
the
hours
of
anguish
which
I
should
have
to
spend
,
that
*NL*
evening
,
alone
in
my
room
,
without
the
possibility
of
going
to
sleep
:
I
*NL*
tried
to
convince
myself
that
they
were
of
no
importance
,
really
,
*NL*
since
I
should
have
forgotten
them
next
morning
,
and
to
fix
my
mind
on
*NL*
thoughts
of
the
future
which
would
carry
me
,
as
on
a
bridge
,
across
the
*NL*
terrifying
abyss
that
yawned
at
my
feet
.
But
my
mind
,
strained
by
this
*NL*
foreboding
,
distended
like
the
look
which
I
shot
at
my
mother
,
would
not
*NL*
allow
any
other
impression
to
enter
.
Thoughts
did
,
indeed
,
enter
it
,
*NL*
but
only
on
the
condition
that
they
left
behind
them
every
element
of
*NL*
beauty
,
or
even
of
quaintness
,
by
which
I
might
have
been
distracted
or
*NL*
beguiled
.
As
a
surgical
patient
,
by
means
of
a
local
anaesthetic
,
can
*NL*
look
on
with
a
clear
consciousness
while
an
operation
is
being
performed
*NL*
upon
him
and
yet
feel
nothing
,
I
could
repeat
to
myself
some
favourite
*NL*
lines
,
or
watch
my
grandfather
attempting
to
talk
to
Swann
about
the
Duc
*NL*
d'Audriffet-Pasquier
,
without
being
able
to
kindle
any
emotion
from
one
*NL*
or
amusement
from
the
other
.
Hardly
had
my
grandfather
begun
to
question
*NL*
Swann
about
that
orator
when
one
of
my
grandmother
's
sisters
,
in
whose
*NL*
ears
the
question
echoed
like
a
solemn
but
untimely
silence
which
her
*NL*
natural
politeness
bade
her
interrupt
,
addressed
the
other
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
fancy
,
Flora
,
I
met
a
young
Swedish
governess
to-day
who
told
*NL*
me
some
most
interesting
things
about
the
co-operative
movement
in
*NL*
Scandinavia
.
We
really
must
have
her
to
dine
here
one
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
!
''
said
her
sister
Flora
,
``
but
I
have
n't
wasted
my
time
*NL*
either
.
I
met
such
a
clever
old
gentleman
at
M.
Vinteuil
's
who
knows
*NL*
Maubant
quite
well
,
and
Maubant
has
told
him
every
little
thing
about
*NL*
how
he
gets
up
his
parts
.
It
is
the
most
interesting
thing
I
ever
heard
.
*NL*
He
is
a
neighbour
of
M.
Vinteuil
's
,
and
I
never
knew
;
and
he
is
so
nice
*NL*
besides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Vinteuil
is
not
the
only
one
who
has
nice
neighbours
,
''
cried
my
aunt
*NL*
Céline
in
a
voice
which
seemed
loud
because
she
was
so
timid
,
and
seemed
*NL*
forced
because
she
had
been
planning
the
little
speech
for
so
long
;
*NL*
darting
,
as
she
spoke
,
what
she
called
a
`
significant
glance
'
at
Swann
.
*NL*
And
my
aunt
Flora
,
who
realised
that
this
veiled
utterance
was
Céline
's
*NL*
way
of
thanking
Swann
intelligibly
for
the
Asti
,
looked
at
him
with
a
*NL*
blend
of
congratulation
and
irony
,
either
just
,
because
she
wished
to
*NL*
underline
her
sister
's
little
epigram
,
or
because
she
envied
Swann
*NL*
his
having
inspired
it
,
or
merely
because
she
imagined
that
he
was
*NL*
embarrassed
,
and
could
not
help
having
a
little
fun
at
his
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
would
be
worth
while
,
''
Flora
went
on
,
``
to
have
this
old
*NL*
gentleman
to
dinner
.
When
you
get
him
upon
Maubant
or
Mme.
Materna
he
*NL*
will
talk
for
hours
on
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
be
delightful
,
''
sighed
my
grandfather
,
in
whose
mind
nature
*NL*
had
unfortunately
forgotten
to
include
any
capacity
whatsoever
for
*NL*
becoming
passionately
interested
in
the
co-operative
movement
among
the
*NL*
ladies
of
Sweden
or
in
the
methods
employed
by
Maubant
to
get
up
his
*NL*
parts
,
just
as
it
had
forgotten
to
endow
my
grandmother
's
two
sisters
*NL*
with
a
grain
of
that
precious
salt
which
one
has
oneself
to
`
add
to
*NL*
taste
'
in
order
to
extract
any
savour
from
a
narrative
of
the
private
*NL*
life
of
Mole
or
of
the
Comte
de
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
!
''
exclaimed
Swann
to
my
grandfather
,
``
what
I
was
going
to
tell
*NL*
you
has
more
to
do
than
you
might
think
with
what
you
were
asking
me
*NL*
just
now
,
for
in
some
respects
there
has
been
very
little
change
.
I
came
*NL*
across
a
passage
in
Saint-Simon
this
morning
which
would
have
amused
*NL*
you
.
It
is
in
the
volume
which
covers
his
mission
to
Spain
;
not
one
*NL*
of
the
best
,
little
more
in
fact
than
a
journal
,
but
at
least
it
is
a
*NL*
journal
wonderfully
well
written
,
which
fairly
distinguishes
it
from
*NL*
the
devastating
journalism
that
we
feel
bound
to
read
in
these
days
,
*NL*
morning
,
noon
and
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
agree
with
you
:
there
are
some
days
when
I
find
reading
the
*NL*
papers
very
pleasant
indeed
!
''
my
aunt
Flora
broke
in
,
to
show
Swann
that
*NL*
she
had
read
the
note
about
his
Corot
in
the
_
Figaro
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
aunt
Céline
went
one
better
.
``
When
they
write
about
things
or
*NL*
people
in
whom
we
are
interested
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
deny
it
,
''
answered
Swann
in
some
bewilderment
.
``
The
fault
I
*NL*
find
with
our
journalism
is
that
it
forces
us
to
take
an
interest
in
*NL*
some
fresh
triviality
or
other
every
day
,
whereas
only
three
or
four
*NL*
books
in
a
lifetime
give
us
anything
that
is
of
real
importance
.
Suppose
*NL*
that
,
every
morning
,
when
we
tore
the
wrapper
off
our
paper
with
fevered
*NL*
hands
,
a
transmutation
were
to
take
place
,
and
we
were
to
find
inside
*NL*
it
--
oh
!
I
do
n't
know
;
shall
we
say
Pascal
's
_
Pensées
_
?
''
He
articulated
*NL*
the
title
with
an
ironic
emphasis
so
as
not
to
appear
pedantic
.
``
And
*NL*
then
,
in
the
gilt
and
tooled
volumes
which
we
open
once
in
ten
years
,
''
*NL*
he
went
on
,
shewing
that
contempt
for
the
things
of
this
world
which
*NL*
some
men
of
the
world
like
to
affect
,
``
we
should
read
that
the
Queen
of
*NL*
the
Hellenes
had
arrived
at
Cannes
,
or
that
the
Princesse
de
Léon
had
*NL*
given
a
fancy
dress
ball
.
In
that
way
we
should
arrive
at
the
right
*NL*
proportion
between
`
information
'
and
`
publicity
.
'
''
But
at
once
*NL*
regretting
that
he
had
allowed
himself
to
speak
,
even
in
jest
,
of
*NL*
serious
matters
,
he
added
ironically
:
``
We
are
having
a
most
entertaining
*NL*
conversation
;
I
can
not
think
why
we
climb
to
these
lofty
summits
,
''
and
*NL*
then
,
turning
to
my
grandfather
:
``
Well
,
Saint-Simon
tells
how
Maulevrier
*NL*
had
had
the
audacity
to
offer
his
hand
to
his
sons
.
You
remember
how
he
*NL*
says
of
Maulevrier
,
`
Never
did
I
find
in
that
coarse
bottle
anything
but
*NL*
ill-humour
,
boorishness
,
and
folly
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coarse
or
not
,
I
know
bottles
in
which
there
is
something
very
*NL*
different
!
''
said
Flora
briskly
,
feeling
bound
to
thank
Swann
as
well
as
*NL*
her
sister
,
since
the
present
of
Asti
had
been
addressed
to
them
both
.
*NL*
Céline
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
was
puzzled
,
but
went
on
:
''
'
I
can
not
say
whether
it
was
his
*NL*
ignorance
or
a
trap
,
'
writes
Saint-Simon
;
`
he
wished
to
give
his
hand
to
*NL*
my
children
.
I
noticed
it
in
time
to
prevent
him
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandfather
was
already
in
ecstasies
over
``
ignorance
or
a
trap
,
''
*NL*
but
Miss
Céline
--
the
name
of
Saint-Simon
,
a
`
man
of
letters
,
'
having
*NL*
arrested
the
complete
paralysis
of
her
sense
of
hearing
--
had
grown
*NL*
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
You
admire
that
,
do
you
?
Well
,
it
is
clever
enough
!
But
what
is
*NL*
the
point
of
it
?
Does
he
mean
that
one
man
is
n't
as
good
as
another
?
*NL*
What
difference
can
it
make
whether
he
is
a
duke
or
a
groom
so
long
*NL*
as
he
is
intelligent
and
good
?
He
had
a
fine
way
of
bringing
up
his
*NL*
children
,
your
Saint-Simon
,
if
he
did
n't
teach
them
to
shake
hands
with
*NL*
all
honest
men
.
Really
and
truly
,
it
's
abominable
.
And
you
dare
to
quote
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
my
grandfather
,
utterly
depressed
,
realising
how
futile
it
would
be
*NL*
for
him
,
against
this
opposition
,
to
attempt
to
get
Swann
to
tell
him
*NL*
the
stories
which
would
have
amused
him
,
murmured
to
my
mother
:
``
Just
*NL*
tell
me
again
that
line
of
yours
which
always
comforts
me
so
much
on
*NL*
these
occasions
.
Oh
,
yes
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
virtues
,
Lord
,
Thou
makest
us
abhor
!
*NL*
*NL*
Good
,
that
is
,
very
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
took
my
eyes
off
my
mother
.
I
knew
that
when
they
were
at
table
*NL*
I
should
not
be
permitted
to
stay
there
for
the
whole
of
dinner-time
,
*NL*
and
that
Mamma
,
for
fear
of
annoying
my
father
,
would
not
allow
me
to
*NL*
give
her
in
public
the
series
of
kisses
that
she
would
have
had
in
my
*NL*
room
.
And
so
I
promised
myself
that
in
the
dining-room
,
as
they
began
*NL*
to
eat
and
drink
and
as
I
felt
the
hour
approach
,
I
would
put
beforehand
*NL*
into
this
kiss
,
which
was
bound
to
be
so
brief
and
stealthy
in
*NL*
execution
,
everything
that
my
own
efforts
could
put
into
it
:
would
*NL*
look
out
very
carefully
first
the
exact
spot
on
her
cheek
where
I
would
*NL*
imprint
it
,
and
would
so
prepare
my
thoughts
that
I
might
be
able
,
*NL*
thanks
to
these
mental
preliminaries
,
to
consecrate
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
minute
Mamma
would
allow
me
to
the
sensation
of
her
cheek
against
my
*NL*
lips
,
as
a
painter
who
can
have
his
subject
for
short
sittings
only
*NL*
prepares
his
palette
,
and
from
what
he
remembers
and
from
rough
notes
*NL*
does
in
advance
everything
which
he
possibly
can
do
in
the
sitter
's
*NL*
absence
.
But
to-night
,
before
the
dinner-bell
had
sounded
,
my
*NL*
grandfather
said
with
unconscious
cruelty
:
``
The
little
man
looks
tired
;
*NL*
he
'd
better
go
up
to
bed
.
Besides
,
we
are
dining
late
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
my
father
,
who
was
less
scrupulous
than
my
grandmother
or
mother
in
*NL*
observing
the
letter
of
a
treaty
,
went
on
:
``
Yes
,
run
along
;
to
bed
with
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
have
kissed
Mamma
then
and
there
,
but
at
that
moment
the
*NL*
dinner-bell
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
leave
your
mother
alone
.
You
've
said
good
night
quite
enough
.
*NL*
These
exhibitions
are
absurd
.
Go
on
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
I
must
set
forth
without
viaticum
;
must
climb
each
step
of
the
*NL*
staircase
`
against
my
heart
,
'
as
the
saying
is
,
climbing
in
opposition
*NL*
to
my
heart
's
desire
,
which
was
to
return
to
my
mother
,
since
she
had
*NL*
not
,
by
her
kiss
,
given
my
heart
leave
to
accompany
me
forth
.
That
*NL*
hateful
staircase
,
up
which
I
always
passed
with
such
dismay
,
gave
out
*NL*
a
smell
of
varnish
which
had
to
some
extent
absorbed
,
made
definite
and
*NL*
fixed
the
special
quality
of
sorrow
that
I
felt
each
evening
,
and
made
*NL*
it
perhaps
even
more
cruel
to
my
sensibility
because
,
when
it
assumed
*NL*
this
olfactory
guise
,
my
intellect
was
powerless
to
resist
it
.
When
we
*NL*
have
gone
to
sleep
with
a
maddening
toothache
and
are
conscious
of
it
*NL*
only
as
a
little
girl
whom
we
attempt
,
time
after
time
,
to
pull
out
*NL*
of
the
water
,
or
as
a
line
of
Molière
which
we
repeat
incessantly
to
*NL*
ourselves
,
it
is
a
great
relief
to
wake
up
,
so
that
our
intelligence
*NL*
can
disentangle
the
idea
of
toothache
from
any
artificial
semblance
of
*NL*
heroism
or
rhythmic
cadence
.
It
was
the
precise
converse
of
this
relief
*NL*
which
I
felt
when
my
anguish
at
having
to
go
up
to
my
room
invaded
my
*NL*
consciousness
in
a
manner
infinitely
more
rapid
,
instantaneous
almost
,
*NL*
a
manner
at
once
insidious
and
brutal
as
I
breathed
in
--
a
far
more
*NL*
poisonous
thing
than
any
moral
penetration
--
the
peculiar
smell
of
the
*NL*
varnish
upon
that
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
in
my
room
I
had
to
stop
every
loophole
,
to
close
the
shutters
,
to
*NL*
dig
my
own
grave
as
I
turned
down
the
bed-clothes
,
to
wrap
myself
in
the
*NL*
shroud
of
my
nightshirt
.
But
before
burying
myself
in
the
iron
bed
which
*NL*
had
been
placed
there
because
,
on
summer
nights
,
I
was
too
hot
among
the
*NL*
red
curtains
of
the
four-poster
,
I
was
stirred
to
revolt
,
and
attempted
*NL*
the
desperate
stratagem
of
a
condemned
prisoner
.
I
wrote
to
my
mother
*NL*
begging
her
to
come
upstairs
for
an
important
reason
which
I
could
not
*NL*
put
in
writing
.
My
fear
was
that
Françoise
,
my
aunt
's
cook
who
used
to
*NL*
be
put
in
charge
of
me
when
I
was
at
Combray
,
might
refuse
to
take
my
*NL*
note
.
I
had
a
suspicion
that
,
in
her
eyes
,
to
carry
a
message
to
*NL*
my
mother
when
there
was
a
stranger
in
the
room
would
appear
flatly
*NL*
inconceivable
,
just
as
it
would
be
for
the
door-keeper
of
a
theatre
*NL*
to
hand
a
letter
to
an
actor
upon
the
stage
.
For
things
which
might
*NL*
or
might
not
be
done
she
possessed
a
code
at
once
imperious
,
abundant
,
*NL*
subtle
,
and
uncompromising
on
points
themselves
imperceptible
or
*NL*
irrelevant
,
which
gave
it
a
resemblance
to
those
ancient
laws
which
*NL*
combine
such
cruel
ordinances
as
the
massacre
of
infants
at
the
breast
*NL*
with
prohibitions
,
of
exaggerated
refinement
,
against
``
seething
the
kid
*NL*
in
his
mother
's
milk
,
''
or
``
eating
of
the
sinew
which
is
upon
the
hollow
*NL*
of
the
thigh
.
''
This
code
,
if
one
could
judge
it
by
the
sudden
obstinacy
*NL*
which
she
would
put
into
her
refusal
to
carry
out
certain
of
our
*NL*
instructions
,
seemed
to
have
foreseen
such
social
complications
and
*NL*
refinements
of
fashion
as
nothing
in
Françoise
's
surroundings
or
in
her
*NL*
career
as
a
servant
in
a
village
household
could
have
put
into
her
head
;
*NL*
and
we
were
obliged
to
assume
that
there
was
latent
in
her
some
past
*NL*
existence
in
the
ancient
history
of
France
,
noble
and
little
understood
,
*NL*
just
as
there
is
in
those
manufacturing
towns
where
old
mansions
still
*NL*
testify
to
their
former
courtly
days
,
and
chemical
workers
toil
among
*NL*
delicately
sculptured
scenes
of
the
Miracle
of
Theophilus
or
the
Quatre
*NL*
Fils
Aymon
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
particular
instance
,
the
article
of
her
code
which
made
it
*NL*
highly
improbable
that
--
barring
an
outbreak
of
fire
--
Françoise
would
*NL*
go
down
and
disturb
Mamma
when
M.
Swann
was
there
for
so
unimportant
a
*NL*
person
as
myself
was
one
embodying
the
respect
she
shewed
not
only
for
*NL*
the
family
-LRB-
as
for
the
dead
,
for
the
clergy
,
or
for
royalty
-RRB-
,
but
also
*NL*
for
the
stranger
within
our
gates
;
a
respect
which
I
should
perhaps
have
*NL*
found
touching
in
a
book
,
but
which
never
failed
to
irritate
me
on
her
*NL*
lips
,
because
of
the
solemn
and
gentle
tones
in
which
she
would
utter
*NL*
it
,
and
which
irritated
me
more
than
usual
this
evening
when
the
sacred
*NL*
character
in
which
she
invested
the
dinner-party
might
have
the
effect
*NL*
of
making
her
decline
to
disturb
its
ceremonial
.
But
to
give
myself
one
*NL*
chance
of
success
I
lied
without
hesitation
,
telling
her
that
it
was
not
*NL*
in
the
least
myself
who
had
wanted
to
write
to
Mamma
,
but
Mamma
who
,
*NL*
on
saying
good
night
to
me
,
had
begged
me
not
to
forget
to
send
her
*NL*
an
answer
about
something
she
had
asked
me
to
find
,
and
that
she
would
*NL*
certainly
be
very
angry
if
this
note
were
not
taken
to
her
.
I
think
that
*NL*
Françoise
disbelieved
me
,
for
,
like
those
primitive
men
whose
senses
*NL*
were
so
much
keener
than
our
own
,
she
could
immediately
detect
,
by
signs
*NL*
imperceptible
by
the
rest
of
us
,
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
anything
that
*NL*
we
might
wish
to
conceal
from
her
.
She
studied
the
envelope
for
five
*NL*
minutes
as
though
an
examination
of
the
paper
itself
and
the
look
of
*NL*
my
handwriting
could
enlighten
her
as
to
the
nature
of
the
contents
,
*NL*
or
tell
her
to
which
article
of
her
code
she
ought
to
refer
the
matter
.
*NL*
Then
she
went
out
with
an
air
of
resignation
which
seemed
to
imply
:
*NL*
``
What
a
dreadful
thing
for
parents
to
have
a
child
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
she
returned
to
say
that
they
were
still
at
the
ice
stage
*NL*
and
that
it
was
impossible
for
the
butler
to
deliver
the
note
at
once
,
*NL*
in
front
of
everybody
;
but
that
when
the
finger-bowls
were
put
round
he
*NL*
would
find
a
way
of
slipping
it
into
Mamma
's
hand
.
At
once
my
anxiety
*NL*
subsided
;
it
was
now
no
longer
-LRB-
as
it
had
been
a
moment
ago
-RRB-
until
*NL*
to-morrow
that
I
had
lost
my
mother
,
for
my
little
line
was
going
--
to
*NL*
annoy
her
,
no
doubt
,
and
doubly
so
because
this
contrivance
would
make
*NL*
me
ridiculous
in
Swann
's
eyes
--
but
was
going
all
the
same
to
admit
me
,
*NL*
invisibly
and
by
stealth
,
into
the
same
room
as
herself
,
was
going
*NL*
to
whisper
from
me
into
her
ear
;
for
that
forbidden
and
unfriendly
*NL*
dining-room
,
where
but
a
moment
ago
the
ice
itself
--
with
burned
nuts
in
*NL*
it
--
and
the
finger-bowls
seemed
to
me
to
be
concealing
pleasures
that
*NL*
were
mischievous
and
of
a
mortal
sadness
because
Mamma
was
tasting
of
*NL*
them
and
I
was
far
away
,
had
opened
its
doors
to
me
and
,
like
a
ripe
*NL*
fruit
which
bursts
through
its
skin
,
was
going
to
pour
out
into
my
*NL*
intoxicated
heart
the
gushing
sweetness
of
Mamma
's
attention
while
she
*NL*
was
reading
what
I
had
written
.
Now
I
was
no
longer
separated
from
her
;
*NL*
the
barriers
were
down
;
an
exquisite
thread
was
binding
us
.
Besides
,
*NL*
that
was
not
all
,
for
surely
Mamma
would
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
agony
through
which
I
had
just
passed
,
I
imagined
that
Swann
*NL*
would
have
laughed
heartily
at
it
if
he
had
read
my
letter
and
had
*NL*
guessed
its
purpose
;
whereas
,
on
the
contrary
,
as
I
was
to
learn
in
due
*NL*
course
,
a
similar
anguish
had
been
the
bane
of
his
life
for
many
years
,
*NL*
and
no
one
perhaps
could
have
understood
my
feelings
at
that
moment
so
*NL*
well
as
himself
;
to
him
,
that
anguish
which
lies
in
knowing
that
the
*NL*
creature
one
adores
is
in
some
place
of
enjoyment
where
oneself
is
not
*NL*
and
can
not
follow
--
to
him
that
anguish
came
through
Love
,
to
which
it
*NL*
is
in
a
sense
predestined
,
by
which
it
must
be
equipped
and
adapted
;
but
*NL*
when
,
as
had
befallen
me
,
such
an
anguish
possesses
one
's
soul
before
*NL*
Love
has
yet
entered
into
one
's
life
,
then
it
must
drift
,
awaiting
*NL*
Love
's
coming
,
vague
and
free
,
without
precise
attachment
,
at
the
*NL*
disposal
of
one
sentiment
to-day
,
of
another
to-morrow
,
of
filial
piety
*NL*
or
affection
for
a
comrade
.
And
the
joy
with
which
I
first
bound
myself
*NL*
apprentice
,
when
Françoise
returned
to
tell
me
that
my
letter
would
be
*NL*
delivered
;
Swann
,
too
,
had
known
well
that
false
joy
which
a
friend
can
*NL*
give
us
,
or
some
relative
of
the
woman
we
love
,
when
on
his
arrival
at
*NL*
the
house
or
theatre
where
she
is
to
be
found
,
for
some
ball
or
party
or
*NL*
`
first-night
'
at
which
he
is
to
meet
her
,
he
sees
us
wandering
outside
,
*NL*
desperately
awaiting
some
opportunity
of
communicating
with
her
.
He
*NL*
recognises
us
,
greets
us
familiarly
,
and
asks
what
we
are
doing
there
.
*NL*
And
when
we
invent
a
story
of
having
some
urgent
message
to
give
to
his
*NL*
relative
or
friend
,
he
assures
us
that
nothing
could
be
more
simple
,
*NL*
takes
us
in
at
the
door
,
and
promises
to
send
her
down
to
us
in
five
*NL*
minutes
.
How
much
we
love
him
--
as
at
that
moment
I
loved
Françoise
--
the
*NL*
good-natured
intermediary
who
by
a
single
word
has
made
supportable
,
*NL*
human
,
almost
propitious
the
inconceivable
,
infernal
scene
of
gaiety
in
*NL*
the
thick
of
which
we
had
been
imagining
swarms
of
enemies
,
perverse
and
*NL*
seductive
,
beguiling
away
from
us
,
even
making
laugh
at
us
,
the
woman
*NL*
whom
we
love
.
If
we
are
to
judge
of
them
by
him
,
this
relative
who
has
*NL*
accosted
us
and
who
is
himself
an
initiate
in
those
cruel
mysteries
,
*NL*
then
the
other
guests
can
not
be
so
very
demoniacal
.
Those
inaccessible
*NL*
and
torturing
hours
into
which
she
had
gone
to
taste
of
unknown
*NL*
pleasures
--
behold
,
a
breach
in
the
wall
,
and
we
are
through
it
.
Behold
,
*NL*
one
of
the
moments
whose
series
will
go
to
make
up
their
sum
,
a
moment
*NL*
as
genuine
as
the
rest
,
if
not
actually
more
important
to
ourself
*NL*
because
our
mistress
is
more
intensely
a
part
of
it
;
we
picture
it
to
*NL*
ourselves
,
we
possess
it
,
we
intervene
upon
it
,
almost
we
have
created
*NL*
it
:
namely
,
the
moment
in
which
he
goes
to
tell
her
that
we
are
waiting
*NL*
there
below
.
And
very
probably
the
other
moments
of
the
party
will
not
*NL*
be
essentially
different
,
will
contain
nothing
else
so
exquisite
or
so
*NL*
well
able
to
make
us
suffer
,
since
this
kind
friend
has
assured
us
that
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
she
will
be
delighted
to
come
down
!
It
will
be
far
more
*NL*
amusing
for
her
to
talk
to
you
than
to
be
bored
up
there
.
''
Alas
!
Swann
*NL*
had
learned
by
experience
that
the
good
intentions
of
a
third
party
are
*NL*
powerless
to
control
a
woman
who
is
annoyed
to
find
herself
pursued
even
*NL*
into
a
ball-room
by
a
man
whom
she
does
not
love
.
Too
often
,
the
kind
*NL*
friend
comes
down
again
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
did
not
appear
,
but
with
no
attempt
to
safeguard
my
*NL*
self-respect
-LRB-
which
depended
upon
her
keeping
up
the
fiction
that
she
*NL*
had
asked
me
to
let
her
know
the
result
of
my
search
for
something
*NL*
or
other
-RRB-
made
Françoise
tell
me
,
in
so
many
words
``
There
is
no
*NL*
answer
''
--
words
I
have
so
often
,
since
then
,
heard
the
hall-porters
in
*NL*
`
mansions
'
and
the
flunkeys
in
gambling-clubs
and
the
like
,
repeat
to
*NL*
some
poor
girl
,
who
replies
in
bewilderment
:
``
What
!
he
's
said
nothing
?
*NL*
It
's
not
possible
.
You
did
give
him
my
letter
,
did
n't
you
?
Very
well
,
*NL*
I
shall
wait
a
little
longer
.
''
And
just
as
she
invariably
protests
that
*NL*
she
does
not
need
the
extra
gas
which
the
porter
offers
to
light
for
*NL*
her
,
and
sits
on
there
,
hearing
nothing
further
,
except
an
occasional
*NL*
remark
on
the
weather
which
the
porter
exchanges
with
a
messenger
*NL*
whom
he
will
send
off
suddenly
,
when
he
notices
the
time
,
to
put
some
*NL*
customer
's
wine
on
the
ice
;
so
,
having
declined
Françoise
's
offer
to
*NL*
make
me
some
tea
or
to
stay
beside
me
,
I
let
her
go
off
again
to
the
*NL*
servants
'
hall
,
and
lay
down
and
shut
my
eyes
,
and
tried
not
to
hear
the
*NL*
voices
of
my
family
who
were
drinking
their
coffee
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
a
few
seconds
I
realised
that
,
by
writing
that
line
to
Mamma
,
*NL*
by
approaching
--
at
the
risk
of
making
her
angry
--
so
near
to
her
that
I
*NL*
felt
I
could
reach
out
and
grasp
the
moment
in
which
I
should
see
her
*NL*
again
,
I
had
cut
myself
off
from
the
possibility
of
going
to
sleep
*NL*
until
I
actually
had
seen
her
,
and
my
heart
began
to
beat
more
and
more
*NL*
painfully
as
I
increased
my
agitation
by
ordering
myself
to
keep
calm
*NL*
and
to
acquiesce
in
my
ill-fortune
.
Then
,
suddenly
,
my
anxiety
subsided
,
*NL*
a
feeling
of
intense
happiness
coursed
through
me
,
as
when
a
strong
*NL*
medicine
begins
to
take
effect
and
one
's
pain
vanishes
:
I
had
formed
a
*NL*
resolution
to
abandon
all
attempts
to
go
to
sleep
without
seeing
Mamma
,
*NL*
and
had
decided
to
kiss
her
at
all
costs
,
even
with
the
certainty
of
*NL*
being
in
disgrace
with
her
for
long
afterwards
,
when
she
herself
came
*NL*
up
to
bed
.
The
tranquillity
which
followed
my
anguish
made
me
extremely
*NL*
alert
,
no
less
than
my
sense
of
expectation
,
my
thirst
for
and
my
fear
*NL*
of
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noiselessly
I
opened
the
window
and
sat
down
on
the
foot
of
my
bed
;
*NL*
hardly
daring
to
move
in
case
they
should
hear
me
from
below
.
Things
*NL*
outside
seemed
also
fixed
in
mute
expectation
,
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
*NL*
moonlight
which
,
duplicating
each
of
them
and
throwing
it
back
by
the
*NL*
extension
,
forwards
,
of
a
shadow
denser
and
more
concrete
than
its
*NL*
substance
,
had
made
the
whole
landscape
seem
at
once
thinner
and
longer
,
*NL*
like
a
map
which
,
after
being
folded
up
,
is
spread
out
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
What
had
to
move
--
a
leaf
of
the
chestnut-tree
,
for
instance
--
moved
.
But
*NL*
its
minute
shuddering
,
complete
,
finished
to
the
least
detail
and
with
*NL*
utmost
delicacy
of
gesture
,
made
no
discord
with
the
rest
of
the
scene
,
*NL*
and
yet
was
not
merged
in
it
,
remaining
clearly
outlined
.
Exposed
upon
*NL*
this
surface
of
silence
,
which
absorbed
nothing
from
them
,
the
most
*NL*
distant
sounds
,
those
which
must
have
come
from
gardens
at
the
far
end
*NL*
of
the
town
,
could
be
distinguished
with
such
exact
`
finish
'
that
the
*NL*
impression
they
gave
of
coming
from
a
distance
seemed
due
only
to
their
*NL*
`
pianissimo
'
execution
,
like
those
movements
on
muted
strings
so
well
*NL*
performed
by
the
orchestra
of
the
Conservatoire
that
,
although
one
does
*NL*
not
lose
a
single
note
,
one
thinks
all
the
same
that
they
are
being
*NL*
played
somewhere
outside
,
a
long
way
from
the
concert
hall
,
so
that
all
*NL*
the
old
subscribers
,
and
my
grandmother
's
sisters
too
,
when
Swann
had
*NL*
given
them
his
seats
,
used
to
strain
their
ears
as
if
they
had
caught
*NL*
the
distant
approach
of
an
army
on
the
march
,
which
had
not
yet
rounded
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
Trévise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
well
aware
that
I
had
placed
myself
in
a
position
than
which
*NL*
none
could
be
counted
upon
to
involve
me
in
graver
consequences
at
my
*NL*
parents
'
hands
;
consequences
far
graver
,
indeed
,
than
a
stranger
would
*NL*
have
imagined
,
and
such
as
-LRB-
he
would
have
thought
-RRB-
could
follow
only
*NL*
some
really
shameful
fault
.
But
in
the
system
of
education
which
they
*NL*
had
given
me
faults
were
not
classified
in
the
same
order
as
in
that
of
*NL*
other
children
,
and
I
had
been
taught
to
place
at
the
head
of
the
list
*NL*
-LRB-
doubtless
because
there
was
no
other
class
of
faults
from
which
*NL*
I
needed
to
be
more
carefully
protected
-RRB-
those
in
which
I
can
now
*NL*
distinguish
the
common
feature
that
one
succumbs
to
them
by
yielding
to
*NL*
a
nervous
impulse
.
But
such
words
as
these
last
had
never
been
uttered
*NL*
in
my
hearing
;
no
one
had
yet
accounted
for
my
temptations
in
a
way
*NL*
which
might
have
led
me
to
believe
that
there
was
some
excuse
for
my
*NL*
giving
in
to
them
,
or
that
I
was
actually
incapable
of
holding
out
*NL*
against
them
.
Yet
I
could
easily
recognise
this
class
of
transgressions
*NL*
by
the
anguish
of
mind
which
preceded
,
as
well
as
by
the
rigour
of
the
*NL*
punishment
which
followed
them
;
and
I
knew
that
what
I
had
just
done
was
*NL*
in
the
same
category
as
certain
other
sins
for
which
I
had
been
severely
*NL*
chastised
,
though
infinitely
more
serious
than
they
.
When
I
went
out
to
*NL*
meet
my
mother
as
she
herself
came
up
to
bed
,
and
when
she
saw
that
I
*NL*
had
remained
up
so
as
to
say
good
night
to
her
again
in
the
passage
,
*NL*
I
should
not
be
allowed
to
stay
in
the
house
a
day
longer
,
I
should
be
*NL*
packed
off
to
school
next
morning
;
so
much
was
certain
.
Very
good
:
had
*NL*
I
been
obliged
,
the
next
moment
,
to
hurl
myself
out
of
the
window
,
*NL*
I
should
still
have
preferred
such
a
fate
.
For
what
I
wanted
now
was
*NL*
Mamma
,
and
to
say
good
night
to
her
.
I
had
gone
too
far
along
the
road
*NL*
which
led
to
the
realisation
of
this
desire
to
be
able
to
retrace
my
*NL*
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hear
my
parents
'
footsteps
as
they
went
with
Swann
;
and
,
when
*NL*
the
rattle
of
the
gate
assured
me
that
he
had
really
gone
,
I
crept
to
*NL*
the
window
.
Mamma
was
asking
my
father
if
he
had
thought
the
lobster
*NL*
good
,
and
whether
M.
Swann
had
had
some
of
the
coffee-and-pistachio
ice
.
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
rather
so-so
,
''
she
was
saying
;
``
next
time
we
shall
have
to
*NL*
try
another
flavour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
,
''
said
my
great-aunt
,
``
what
a
change
I
find
in
Swann
.
*NL*
He
is
quite
antiquated
!
''
She
had
grown
so
accustomed
to
seeing
Swann
*NL*
always
in
the
same
stage
of
adolescence
that
it
was
a
shock
to
her
to
*NL*
find
him
suddenly
less
young
than
the
age
she
still
attributed
to
him
.
*NL*
And
the
others
too
were
beginning
to
remark
in
Swann
that
abnormal
,
*NL*
excessive
,
scandalous
senescence
,
meet
only
in
a
celibate
,
in
one
of
*NL*
that
class
for
whom
it
seems
that
the
great
day
which
knows
no
morrow
*NL*
must
be
longer
than
for
other
men
,
since
for
such
a
one
it
is
void
of
*NL*
promise
,
and
from
its
dawn
the
moments
steadily
accumulate
without
any
*NL*
subsequent
partition
among
his
offspring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancy
he
has
a
lot
of
trouble
with
that
wretched
wife
of
his
,
who
*NL*
`
lives
'
with
a
certain
Monsieur
de
Charlus
,
as
all
Combray
knows
.
It
's
*NL*
the
talk
of
the
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
observed
that
,
in
spite
of
this
,
he
had
looked
much
less
*NL*
unhappy
of
late
.
``
And
he
does
n't
nearly
so
often
do
that
trick
of
his
,
*NL*
so
like
his
father
,
of
wiping
his
eyes
and
passing
his
hand
across
his
*NL*
forehead
.
I
think
myself
that
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
does
n't
love
his
*NL*
wife
any
more
.

*NL*

Why
,
of
course
he
does
n't
,
''
answered
my
grandfather
.
``
He
wrote
me
a
*NL*
letter
about
it
,
ages
ago
,
to
which
I
took
care
to
pay
no
attention
,
but
*NL*
it
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
feelings
,
let
alone
his
love
for
his
wife
.
*NL*
Hullo
!
you
two
;
you
never
thanked
him
for
the
Asti
!
''
he
went
on
,
turning
*NL*
to
his
sisters-in-law
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
we
never
thanked
him
?
I
think
,
between
you
and
me
,
that
I
put
it
*NL*
to
him
quite
neatly
,
''
replied
my
aunt
Flora
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
managed
it
very
well
;
I
admired
you
for
it
,
''
said
my
aunt
*NL*
Céline
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
did
it
very
prettily
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
liked
my
expression
about
`
nice
neighbours
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Do
you
call
that
thanking
him
?
''
shouted
my
grandfather
.
``
I
heard
*NL*
that
all
right
,
but
devil
take
me
if
I
guessed
it
was
meant
for
Swann
.
*NL*
You
may
be
quite
sure
he
never
noticed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
;
Swann
is
not
a
fool
.
I
am
positive
he
appreciated
the
*NL*
compliment
.
You
did
n't
expect
me
to
tell
him
the
number
of
bottles
,
or
*NL*
to
guess
what
he
paid
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
and
mother
were
left
alone
and
sat
down
for
a
moment
;
then
my
*NL*
father
said
:
``
Well
,
shall
we
go
up
to
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
wish
,
dear
,
though
I
do
n't
feel
in
the
least
like
sleeping
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
why
;
it
ca
n't
be
the
coffee-ice
--
it
was
n't
strong
enough
to
*NL*
keep
me
awake
like
this
.
But
I
see
a
light
in
the
servants
'
hall
:
poor
*NL*
Françoise
has
been
sitting
up
for
me
,
so
I
will
get
her
to
unhook
me
*NL*
while
you
go
and
undress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
opened
the
latticed
door
which
led
from
the
hall
to
the
*NL*
staircase
.
Presently
I
heard
her
coming
upstairs
to
close
her
window
.
I
*NL*
went
quietly
into
the
passage
;
my
heart
was
beating
so
violently
that
I
*NL*
could
hardly
move
,
but
at
least
it
was
throbbing
no
longer
with
anxiety
,
*NL*
but
with
terror
and
with
joy
.
I
saw
in
the
well
of
the
stair
a
light
*NL*
coming
upwards
,
from
Mamma
's
candle
.
Then
I
saw
Mamma
herself
:
I
threw
*NL*
myself
upon
her
.
For
an
instant
she
looked
at
me
in
astonishment
,
not
*NL*
realising
what
could
have
happened
.
Then
her
face
assumed
an
expression
*NL*
of
anger
.
She
said
not
a
single
word
to
me
;
and
,
for
that
matter
,
I
used
*NL*
to
go
for
days
on
end
without
being
spoken
to
,
for
far
less
offences
*NL*
than
this
.
A
single
word
from
Mamma
would
have
been
an
admission
that
*NL*
further
intercourse
with
me
was
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
,
*NL*
and
that
might
perhaps
have
appeared
to
me
more
terrible
still
,
as
*NL*
indicating
that
,
with
such
a
punishment
as
was
in
store
for
me
,
mere
*NL*
silence
,
and
even
anger
,
were
relatively
puerile
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
word
from
her
then
would
have
implied
the
false
calm
in
which
one
*NL*
converses
with
a
servant
to
whom
one
has
just
decided
to
give
notice
;
*NL*
the
kiss
one
bestows
on
a
son
who
is
being
packed
off
to
enlist
,
which
*NL*
would
have
been
denied
him
if
it
had
merely
been
a
matter
of
being
*NL*
angry
with
him
for
a
few
days
.
But
she
heard
my
father
coming
from
the
*NL*
dressing-room
,
where
he
had
gone
to
take
off
his
clothes
,
and
,
to
avoid
*NL*
the
`
scene
'
which
he
would
make
if
he
saw
me
,
she
said
,
in
a
voice
*NL*
half-stifled
by
her
anger
:
``
Run
away
at
once
.
Do
n't
let
your
father
see
*NL*
you
standing
there
like
a
crazy
jane
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
begged
her
again
to
``
Come
and
say
good
night
to
me
!
''
terrified
as
*NL*
I
saw
the
light
from
my
father
's
candle
already
creeping
up
the
wall
,
*NL*
but
also
making
use
of
his
approach
as
a
means
of
blackmail
,
in
the
hope
*NL*
that
my
mother
,
not
wishing
him
to
find
me
there
,
as
find
me
he
must
*NL*
if
she
continued
to
hold
out
,
would
give
in
to
me
,
and
say
:
``
Go
back
to
*NL*
your
room
.
I
will
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Too
late
:
my
father
was
upon
us
.
Instinctively
I
murmured
,
though
no
one
*NL*
heard
me
,
``
I
am
done
for
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
,
however
.
My
father
used
constantly
to
refuse
to
let
me
do
*NL*
things
which
were
quite
clearly
allowed
by
the
more
liberal
charters
*NL*
granted
me
by
my
mother
and
grandmother
,
because
he
paid
no
heed
to
*NL*
`
Principles
,
'
and
because
in
his
sight
there
were
no
such
things
as
*NL*
`
Rights
of
Man
.
'
For
some
quite
irrelevant
reason
,
or
for
no
reason
at
*NL*
all
,
he
would
at
the
last
moment
prevent
me
from
taking
some
particular
*NL*
walk
,
one
so
regular
and
so
consecrated
to
my
use
that
to
deprive
me
of
*NL*
it
was
a
clear
breach
of
faith
;
or
again
,
as
he
had
done
this
evening
,
*NL*
long
before
the
appointed
hour
he
would
snap
out
:
``
Run
along
up
to
*NL*
bed
now
;
no
excuses
!
''
But
then
again
,
simply
because
he
was
devoid
*NL*
of
principles
-LRB-
in
my
grandmother
's
sense
-RRB-
,
so
he
could
not
,
properly
*NL*
speaking
,
be
called
inexorable
.
He
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
with
an
air
*NL*
of
annoyance
and
surprise
,
and
then
when
Mamma
had
told
him
,
not
without
*NL*
some
embarrassment
,
what
had
happened
,
said
to
her
:
``
Go
along
with
him
,
*NL*
then
;
you
said
just
now
that
you
did
n't
feel
like
sleep
,
so
stay
in
his
*NL*
room
for
a
little
.
I
do
n't
need
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
dear
,
''
my
mother
answered
timidly
,
``
whether
or
not
I
feel
like
*NL*
sleep
is
not
the
point
;
we
must
not
make
the
child
accustomed
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
question
of
making
him
accustomed
,
''
said
my
father
,
with
*NL*
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
;
``
you
can
see
quite
well
that
the
child
is
*NL*
unhappy
.
After
all
,
we
are
n't
gaolers
.
You
'll
end
by
making
him
ill
,
*NL*
and
a
lot
of
good
that
will
do
.
There
are
two
beds
in
his
room
;
tell
*NL*
Françoise
to
make
up
the
big
one
for
you
,
and
stay
beside
him
for
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
night
.
I
'm
off
to
bed
,
anyhow
;
I
'm
not
nervous
like
you
.
*NL*
Good
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
for
me
to
thank
my
father
;
what
he
called
my
*NL*
sentimentality
would
have
exasperated
him
.
I
stood
there
,
not
daring
*NL*
to
move
;
he
was
still
confronting
us
,
an
immense
figure
in
his
white
*NL*
nightshirt
,
crowned
with
the
pink
and
violet
scarf
of
Indian
cashmere
*NL*
in
which
,
since
he
had
begun
to
suffer
from
neuralgia
,
he
used
to
tie
up
*NL*
his
head
,
standing
like
Abraham
in
the
engraving
after
Benozzo
Gozzoli
*NL*
which
M.
Swann
had
given
me
,
telling
Sarah
that
she
must
tear
herself
*NL*
away
from
Isaac
.
Many
years
have
passed
since
that
night
.
The
wall
of
*NL*
the
staircase
,
up
which
I
had
watched
the
light
of
his
candle
gradually
*NL*
climb
,
was
long
ago
demolished
.
And
in
myself
,
too
,
many
things
have
*NL*
perished
which
,
I
imagined
,
would
last
for
ever
,
and
new
structures
have
*NL*
arisen
,
giving
birth
to
new
sorrows
and
new
joys
which
in
those
days
*NL*
I
could
not
have
foreseen
,
just
as
now
the
old
are
difficult
of
*NL*
comprehension
.
It
is
a
long
time
,
too
,
since
my
father
has
been
able
*NL*
to
tell
Mamma
to
``
Go
with
the
child
.
''
Never
again
will
such
hours
be
*NL*
possible
for
me
.
But
of
late
I
have
been
increasingly
able
to
catch
,
if
*NL*
I
listen
attentively
,
the
sound
of
the
sobs
which
I
had
the
strength
to
*NL*
control
in
my
father
's
presence
,
and
which
broke
out
only
when
I
found
*NL*
myself
alone
with
Mamma
.
Actually
,
their
echo
has
never
ceased
:
it
is
*NL*
only
because
life
is
now
growing
more
and
more
quiet
round
about
me
that
*NL*
I
hear
them
afresh
,
like
those
convent
bells
which
are
so
effectively
*NL*
drowned
during
the
day
by
the
noises
of
the
streets
that
one
would
*NL*
suppose
them
to
have
been
stopped
for
ever
,
until
they
sound
out
again
*NL*
through
the
silent
evening
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mamma
spent
that
night
in
my
room
:
when
I
had
just
committed
a
sin
so
*NL*
deadly
that
I
was
waiting
to
be
banished
from
the
household
,
my
parents
*NL*
gave
me
a
far
greater
concession
than
I
should
ever
have
won
as
the
*NL*
reward
of
a
good
action
.
Even
at
the
moment
when
it
manifested
itself
in
*NL*
this
crowning
mercy
,
my
father
's
conduct
towards
me
was
still
somewhat
*NL*
arbitrary
,
and
regardless
of
my
deserts
,
as
was
characteristic
of
him
*NL*
and
due
to
the
fact
that
his
actions
were
generally
dictated
by
chance
*NL*
expediencies
rather
than
based
on
any
formal
plan
.
And
perhaps
even
what
*NL*
I
called
his
strictness
,
when
he
sent
me
off
to
bed
,
deserved
that
*NL*
title
less
,
really
,
than
my
mother
's
or
grandmother
's
attitude
,
for
his
*NL*
nature
,
which
in
some
respects
differed
more
than
theirs
from
my
own
,
*NL*
had
probably
prevented
him
from
guessing
,
until
then
,
how
wretched
I
was
*NL*
every
evening
,
a
thing
which
my
mother
and
grandmother
knew
well
;
but
*NL*
they
loved
me
enough
to
be
unwilling
to
spare
me
that
suffering
,
*NL*
which
they
hoped
to
teach
me
to
overcome
,
so
as
to
reduce
my
nervous
*NL*
sensibility
and
to
strengthen
my
will
.
As
for
my
father
,
whose
affection
*NL*
for
me
was
of
another
kind
,
I
doubt
if
he
would
have
shewn
so
much
*NL*
courage
,
for
as
soon
as
he
had
grasped
the
fact
that
I
was
unhappy
he
*NL*
had
said
to
my
mother
:
``
Go
and
comfort
him
.
''
Mamma
stayed
all
night
in
*NL*
my
room
,
and
it
seemed
that
she
did
not
wish
to
mar
by
recrimination
*NL*
those
hours
,
so
different
from
anything
that
I
had
had
a
right
to
*NL*
expect
;
for
when
Françoise
-LRB-
who
guessed
that
something
extraordinary
*NL*
must
have
happened
when
she
saw
Mamma
sitting
by
my
side
,
holding
my
*NL*
hand
and
letting
me
cry
unchecked
-RRB-
said
to
her
:
``
But
,
Madame
,
what
is
*NL*
little
Master
crying
for
?
''
she
replied
:
``
Why
,
Françoise
,
he
does
n't
know
*NL*
himself
:
it
is
his
nerves
.
Make
up
the
big
bed
for
me
quickly
and
then
*NL*
go
off
to
your
own
.
''
And
thus
for
the
first
time
my
unhappiness
was
*NL*
regarded
no
longer
as
a
fault
for
which
I
must
be
punished
,
but
as
*NL*
an
involuntary
evil
which
had
been
officially
recognised
a
nervous
*NL*
condition
for
which
I
was
in
no
way
responsible
:
I
had
the
consolation
*NL*
that
I
need
no
longer
mingle
apprehensive
scruples
with
the
bitterness
*NL*
of
my
tears
;
I
could
weep
henceforward
without
sin
.
I
felt
no
small
*NL*
degree
of
pride
,
either
,
in
Françoise
presence
at
this
return
to
humane
*NL*
conditions
which
,
not
an
hour
after
Mamma
had
refused
to
come
up
to
my
*NL*
room
and
had
sent
the
snubbing
message
that
I
was
to
go
to
sleep
,
raised
*NL*
me
to
the
dignity
of
a
grown-up
person
,
brought
me
of
a
sudden
to
a
sort
*NL*
of
puberty
of
sorrow
,
to
emancipation
from
tears
.
I
ought
then
to
have
*NL*
been
happy
;
I
was
not
.
It
struck
me
that
my
mother
had
just
made
a
first
*NL*
concession
which
must
have
been
painful
to
her
,
that
it
was
a
first
step
*NL*
down
from
the
ideal
she
had
formed
for
me
,
and
that
for
the
first
time
*NL*
she
,
with
all
her
courage
,
had
to
confess
herself
beaten
.
It
struck
*NL*
me
that
if
I
had
just
scored
a
victory
it
was
over
her
;
that
I
had
*NL*
succeeded
,
as
sickness
or
sorrow
or
age
might
have
succeeded
,
in
*NL*
relaxing
her
will
,
in
altering
her
judgment
;
that
this
evening
opened
*NL*
a
new
era
,
must
remain
a
black
date
in
the
calendar
.
And
if
I
had
dared
*NL*
now
,
I
should
have
said
to
Mamma
:
``
No
,
I
do
n't
want
you
;
you
must
n't
*NL*
sleep
here
.
''
But
I
was
conscious
of
the
practical
wisdom
,
of
what
*NL*
would
be
called
nowadays
the
realism
with
which
she
tempered
the
ardent
*NL*
idealism
of
my
grandmother
's
nature
,
and
I
knew
that
now
the
mischief
*NL*
was
done
she
would
prefer
to
let
me
enjoy
the
soothing
pleasure
of
*NL*
her
company
,
and
not
to
disturb
my
father
again
.
Certainly
my
mother
's
*NL*
beautiful
features
seemed
to
shine
again
with
youth
that
evening
,
as
she
*NL*
sat
gently
holding
my
hands
and
trying
to
check
my
tears
;
but
,
just
for
*NL*
that
reason
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
should
not
have
happened
;
her
*NL*
anger
would
have
been
less
difficult
to
endure
than
this
new
kindness
*NL*
which
my
childhood
had
not
known
;
I
felt
that
I
had
with
an
impious
and
*NL*
secret
finger
traced
a
first
wrinkle
upon
her
soul
and
made
the
first
*NL*
white
hair
shew
upon
her
head
.
This
thought
redoubled
my
sobs
,
and
then
*NL*
I
saw
that
Mamma
,
who
had
never
allowed
herself
to
go
to
any
length
*NL*
of
tenderness
with
me
,
was
suddenly
overcome
by
my
tears
and
had
to
*NL*
struggle
to
keep
back
her
own
.
Then
,
as
she
saw
that
I
had
noticed
*NL*
this
,
she
said
to
me
,
with
a
smile
:
``
Why
,
my
little
buttercup
,
my
little
*NL*
canary-boy
,
he
's
going
to
make
Mamma
as
silly
as
himself
if
this
goes
*NL*
on
.
Look
,
since
you
ca
n't
sleep
,
and
Mamma
ca
n't
either
,
we
must
n't
*NL*
go
on
in
this
stupid
way
;
we
must
do
something
;
I
'll
get
one
of
your
*NL*
books
.
''
But
I
had
none
there
.
``
Would
you
like
me
to
get
out
the
books
*NL*
now
that
your
grandmother
is
going
to
give
you
for
your
birthday
?
Just
*NL*
think
it
over
first
,
and
do
n't
be
disappointed
if
there
is
nothing
new
*NL*
for
you
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
only
too
delighted
,
and
Mamma
went
to
find
a
parcel
of
books
*NL*
in
which
I
could
not
distinguish
,
through
the
paper
in
which
it
was
*NL*
wrapped
,
any
more
than
its
squareness
and
size
,
but
which
,
even
at
this
*NL*
first
glimpse
,
brief
and
obscure
as
it
was
,
bade
fair
to
eclipse
already
*NL*
the
paint-box
of
last
New
Year
's
Day
and
the
silkworms
of
the
year
*NL*
before
.
It
contained
_
La
Mare
au
Diable
_
,
_
François
le
Champi
_
,
_
La
*NL*
Petite
Fadette
_
,
and
_
Les
Maîtres
Sonneurs
_
.
My
grandmother
,
as
I
*NL*
learned
afterwards
,
had
at
first
chosen
Mussel
's
poems
,
a
volume
of
*NL*
Rousseau
,
and
_
Indiana
_
;
for
while
she
considered
light
reading
as
*NL*
unwholesome
as
sweets
and
cakes
,
she
did
not
reflect
that
the
strong
*NL*
breath
of
genius
must
have
upon
the
very
soul
of
a
child
an
influence
*NL*
at
once
more
dangerous
and
less
quickening
than
those
of
fresh
air
and
*NL*
country
breezes
upon
his
body
.
But
when
my
father
had
seemed
almost
to
*NL*
regard
her
as
insane
on
learning
the
names
of
the
books
she
proposed
*NL*
to
give
me
,
she
had
journeyed
back
by
herself
to
Jouy-le-Vicomte
to
*NL*
the
bookseller
's
,
so
that
there
should
be
no
fear
of
my
not
having
my
*NL*
present
in
time
-LRB-
it
was
a
burning
hot
day
,
and
she
had
come
home
so
*NL*
unwell
that
the
doctor
had
warned
my
mother
not
to
allow
her
again
*NL*
to
tire
herself
in
that
way
-RRB-
,
and
had
there
fallen
back
upon
the
four
*NL*
pastoral
novels
of
George
Sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
she
had
said
to
Mamma
,
``
I
could
not
allow
myself
to
give
the
*NL*
child
anything
that
was
not
well
written
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
was
that
she
could
never
make
up
her
mind
to
purchase
anything
*NL*
from
which
no
intellectual
profit
was
to
be
derived
,
and
,
above
all
,
*NL*
that
profit
which
good
things
bestowed
on
us
by
teaching
us
to
seek
our
*NL*
pleasures
elsewhere
than
in
the
barren
satisfaction
of
worldly
wealth
.
*NL*
Even
when
she
had
to
make
some
one
a
present
of
the
kind
called
*NL*
`
useful
,
'
when
she
had
to
give
an
armchair
or
some
table-silver
or
*NL*
a
walking-stick
,
she
would
choose
`
antiques
,
'
as
though
their
long
*NL*
desuetude
had
effaced
from
them
any
semblance
of
utility
and
fitted
*NL*
them
rather
to
instruct
us
in
the
lives
of
the
men
of
other
days
than
*NL*
to
serve
the
common
requirements
of
our
own
.
She
would
have
liked
me
to
*NL*
have
in
my
room
photographs
of
ancient
buildings
or
of
beautiful
places
.
*NL*
But
at
the
moment
of
buying
them
,
and
for
all
that
the
subject
of
the
*NL*
picture
had
an
aesthetic
value
of
its
own
,
she
would
find
that
vulgarity
*NL*
and
utility
had
too
prominent
a
part
in
them
,
through
the
mechanical
*NL*
nature
of
their
reproduction
by
photography
.
She
attempted
by
a
*NL*
subterfuge
,
if
not
to
eliminate
altogether
their
commercial
banality
,
*NL*
at
least
to
minimise
it
,
to
substitute
for
the
bulk
of
it
what
was
*NL*
art
still
,
to
introduce
,
as
it
might
be
,
several
`
thicknesses
'
of
*NL*
art
;
instead
of
photographs
of
Chartres
Cathedral
,
of
the
Fountains
*NL*
of
Saint-Cloud
,
or
of
Vesuvius
she
would
inquire
of
Swann
whether
some
*NL*
great
painter
had
not
made
pictures
of
them
,
and
preferred
to
give
me
*NL*
photographs
of
`
Chartres
Cathedral
'
after
Corot
,
of
the
`
Fountains
of
*NL*
Saint-Cloud
'
after
Hubert
Robert
,
and
of
`
Vesuvius
'
after
Turner
,
which
*NL*
were
a
stage
higher
in
the
scale
of
art
.
But
although
the
photographer
*NL*
had
been
prevented
from
reproducing
directly
the
masterpieces
or
the
*NL*
beauties
of
nature
,
and
had
there
been
replaced
by
a
great
artist
,
he
*NL*
resumed
his
odious
position
when
it
came
to
reproducing
the
artist
's
*NL*
interpretation
.
Accordingly
,
having
to
reckon
again
with
vulgarity
,
*NL*
my
grandmother
would
endeavour
to
postpone
the
moment
of
contact
still
*NL*
further
.
She
would
ask
Swann
if
the
picture
had
not
been
engraved
,
*NL*
preferring
,
when
possible
,
old
engravings
with
some
interest
of
*NL*
association
apart
from
themselves
,
such
,
for
example
,
as
shew
us
a
*NL*
masterpiece
in
a
state
in
which
we
can
no
longer
see
it
to-day
,
as
*NL*
Morghen
's
print
of
the
`
Cenacolo
'
of
Leonardo
before
it
was
spoiled
*NL*
by
restoration
.
It
must
be
admitted
that
the
results
of
this
method
of
*NL*
interpreting
the
art
of
making
presents
were
not
always
happy
.
The
idea
*NL*
which
I
formed
of
Venice
,
from
a
drawing
by
Titian
which
is
supposed
to
*NL*
have
the
lagoon
in
the
background
,
was
certainly
far
less
accurate
than
*NL*
what
I
have
since
derived
from
ordinary
photographs
.
We
could
no
*NL*
longer
keep
count
in
the
family
-LRB-
when
my
great-aunt
tried
to
frame
an
*NL*
indictment
of
my
grandmother
-RRB-
of
all
the
armchairs
she
had
presented
*NL*
to
married
couples
,
young
and
old
,
which
on
a
first
attempt
to
sit
down
*NL*
upon
them
had
at
once
collapsed
beneath
the
weight
of
their
recipient
.
*NL*
But
my
grandmother
would
have
thought
it
sordid
to
concern
herself
too
*NL*
closely
with
the
solidity
of
any
piece
of
furniture
in
which
could
still
*NL*
be
discerned
a
flourish
,
a
smile
,
a
brave
conceit
of
the
past
.
And
*NL*
even
what
in
such
pieces
supplied
a
material
need
,
since
it
did
so
in
a
*NL*
manner
to
which
we
are
no
longer
accustomed
,
was
as
charming
to
her
as
*NL*
one
of
those
old
forms
of
speech
in
which
we
can
still
see
traces
of
a
*NL*
metaphor
whose
fine
point
has
been
worn
away
by
the
rough
usage
of
our
*NL*
modern
tongue
.
In
precisely
the
same
way
the
pastoral
novels
of
George
*NL*
Sand
,
which
she
was
giving
me
for
my
birthday
,
were
regular
lumber-rooms
*NL*
of
antique
furniture
,
full
of
expressions
that
have
fallen
out
of
use
*NL*
and
returned
as
imagery
,
such
as
one
finds
now
only
in
country
dialects
.
*NL*
And
my
grandmother
had
bought
them
in
preference
to
other
books
,
just
as
*NL*
she
would
have
preferred
to
take
a
house
that
had
a
gothic
dovecot
,
or
*NL*
some
other
such
piece
of
antiquity
as
would
have
a
pleasant
effect
on
*NL*
the
mind
,
filling
it
with
a
nostalgic
longing
for
impossible
journeys
*NL*
through
the
realms
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mamma
sat
down
by
my
bed
;
she
had
chosen
_
François
le
Champi
_
,
whose
*NL*
reddish
cover
and
incomprehensible
title
gave
it
a
distinct
personality
*NL*
in
my
eyes
and
a
mysterious
attraction
.
I
had
not
then
read
any
real
*NL*
novels
.
I
had
heard
it
said
that
George
Sand
was
a
typical
novelist
.
*NL*
That
prepared
me
in
advance
to
imagine
that
_
François
le
Champi
_
*NL*
contained
something
inexpressibly
delicious
.
The
course
of
the
*NL*
narrative
,
where
it
tended
to
arouse
curiosity
or
melt
to
pity
,
certain
*NL*
modes
of
expression
which
disturb
or
sadden
the
reader
,
and
which
,
with
*NL*
a
little
experience
,
he
may
recognise
as
`
common
form
'
in
novels
,
seemed
*NL*
to
me
then
distinctive
--
for
to
me
a
new
book
was
not
one
of
a
number
of
*NL*
similar
objects
,
but
was
like
an
individual
man
,
unmatched
,
and
with
no
*NL*
cause
of
existence
beyond
himself
--
an
intoxicating
whiff
of
the
peculiar
*NL*
essence
of
_
François
le
Champi
_
.
Beneath
the
everyday
incidents
,
the
*NL*
commonplace
thoughts
and
hackneyed
words
,
I
could
hear
,
or
overhear
,
an
*NL*
intonation
,
a
rhythmic
utterance
fine
and
strange
.
The
`
action
'
began
:
*NL*
to
me
it
seemed
all
the
more
obscure
because
in
those
days
,
when
I
read
*NL*
to
myself
,
I
used
often
,
while
I
turned
the
pages
,
to
dream
of
something
*NL*
quite
different
.
And
to
the
gaps
which
this
habit
made
in
my
knowledge
*NL*
of
the
story
more
were
added
by
the
fact
that
when
it
was
Mamma
who
was
*NL*
reading
to
me
aloud
she
left
all
the
love-scenes
out
.
And
so
all
the
odd
*NL*
changes
which
take
place
in
the
relations
between
the
miller
's
wife
and
*NL*
the
boy
,
changes
which
only
the
birth
and
growth
of
love
can
explain
,
*NL*
seemed
to
me
plunged
and
steeped
in
a
mystery
,
the
key
to
which
-LRB-
as
I
*NL*
could
readily
believe
-RRB-
lay
in
that
strange
and
pleasant-sounding
name
of
*NL*
_
Champi
_
,
which
draped
the
boy
who
bore
it
,
I
knew
not
why
,
in
its
own
*NL*
bright
colour
,
purpurate
and
charming
.
If
my
mother
was
not
a
faithful
*NL*
reader
,
she
was
,
none
the
less
,
admirable
when
reading
a
work
in
which
*NL*
she
found
the
note
of
true
feeling
by
the
respectful
simplicity
of
her
*NL*
interpretation
and
by
the
sound
of
her
sweet
and
gentle
voice
.
It
was
*NL*
the
same
in
her
daily
life
,
when
it
was
not
works
of
art
but
men
and
*NL*
women
whom
she
was
moved
to
pity
or
admire
:
it
was
touching
to
observe
*NL*
with
what
deference
she
would
banish
from
her
voice
,
her
gestures
,
from
*NL*
her
whole
conversation
,
now
the
note
of
joy
which
might
have
distressed
*NL*
some
mother
who
had
long
ago
lost
a
child
,
now
the
recollection
of
an
*NL*
event
or
anniversary
which
might
have
reminded
some
old
gentleman
of
the
*NL*
burden
of
his
years
,
now
the
household
topic
which
might
have
bored
some
*NL*
young
man
of
letters
.
And
so
,
when
she
read
aloud
the
prose
of
George
*NL*
Sand
,
prose
which
is
everywhere
redolent
of
that
generosity
and
moral
*NL*
distinction
which
Mamma
had
learned
from
my
grandmother
to
place
above
*NL*
all
other
qualities
in
life
,
and
which
I
was
not
to
teach
her
until
*NL*
much
later
to
refrain
from
placing
,
in
the
same
way
,
above
all
other
*NL*
qualities
in
literature
;
taking
pains
to
banish
from
her
voice
any
*NL*
weakness
or
affectation
which
might
have
blocked
its
channel
for
that
*NL*
powerful
stream
of
language
,
she
supplied
all
the
natural
tenderness
,
*NL*
all
the
lavish
sweetness
which
they
demanded
to
phrases
which
seemed
*NL*
to
have
been
composed
for
her
voice
,
and
which
were
all
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
within
her
compass
.
She
came
to
them
with
the
tone
that
they
required
,
*NL*
with
the
cordial
accent
which
existed
before
they
were
,
which
dictated
*NL*
them
,
but
which
is
not
to
be
found
in
the
words
themselves
,
and
by
these
*NL*
means
she
smoothed
away
,
as
she
read
on
,
any
harshness
there
might
be
*NL*
or
discordance
in
the
tenses
of
verbs
,
endowing
the
imperfect
and
the
*NL*
preterite
with
all
the
sweetness
which
there
is
in
generosity
,
all
the
*NL*
melancholy
which
there
is
in
love
;
guided
the
sentence
that
was
drawing
*NL*
to
an
end
towards
that
which
was
waiting
to
begin
,
now
hastening
,
now
*NL*
slackening
the
pace
of
the
syllables
so
as
to
bring
them
,
despite
their
*NL*
difference
of
quantity
,
into
a
uniform
rhythm
,
and
breathed
into
this
*NL*
quite
ordinary
prose
a
kind
of
life
,
continuous
and
full
of
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
agony
was
soothed
;
I
let
myself
be
borne
upon
the
current
of
this
*NL*
gentle
night
on
which
I
had
my
mother
by
my
side
.
I
knew
that
such
a
*NL*
night
could
not
be
repeated
;
that
the
strongest
desire
I
had
in
the
*NL*
world
,
namely
,
to
keep
my
mother
in
my
room
through
the
sad
hours
of
*NL*
darkness
,
ran
too
much
counter
to
general
requirements
and
to
the
wishes
*NL*
of
others
for
such
a
concession
as
had
been
granted
me
this
evening
to
*NL*
be
anything
but
a
rare
and
casual
exception
.
To-morrow
night
I
should
*NL*
again
be
the
victim
of
anguish
and
Mamma
would
not
stay
by
my
side
.
But
*NL*
when
these
storms
of
anguish
grew
calm
I
could
no
longer
realise
*NL*
their
existence
;
besides
,
tomorrow
evening
was
still
a
long
way
off
;
*NL*
I
reminded
myself
that
I
should
still
have
time
to
think
about
things
,
*NL*
albeit
that
remission
of
time
could
bring
me
no
access
of
power
,
albeit
*NL*
the
coming
event
was
in
no
way
dependent
upon
the
exercise
of
my
will
,
*NL*
and
seemed
not
quite
inevitable
only
because
it
was
still
separated
from
*NL*
me
by
this
short
interval
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
was
that
,
for
a
long
time
afterwards
,
when
I
lay
awake
at
*NL*
night
and
revived
old
memories
of
Combray
,
I
saw
no
more
of
it
than
*NL*
this
sort
of
luminous
panel
,
sharply
defined
against
a
vague
and
shadowy
*NL*
background
,
like
the
panels
which
a
Bengal
fire
or
some
electric
sign
*NL*
will
illuminate
and
dissect
from
the
front
of
a
building
the
other
*NL*
parts
of
which
remain
plunged
in
darkness
:
broad
enough
at
its
base
,
the
*NL*
little
parlour
,
the
dining-room
,
the
alluring
shadows
of
the
path
along
*NL*
which
would
come
M.
Swann
,
the
unconscious
author
of
my
sufferings
,
the
*NL*
hall
through
which
I
would
journey
to
the
first
step
of
that
staircase
,
*NL*
so
hard
to
climb
,
which
constituted
,
all
by
itself
,
the
tapering
*NL*
`
elevation
'
of
an
irregular
pyramid
;
and
,
at
the
summit
,
my
bedroom
,
*NL*
with
the
little
passage
through
whose
glazed
door
Mamma
would
enter
;
*NL*
in
a
word
,
seen
always
at
the
same
evening
hour
,
isolated
from
all
*NL*
its
possible
surroundings
,
detached
and
solitary
against
its
shadowy
*NL*
background
,
the
bare
minimum
of
scenery
necessary
-LRB-
like
the
setting
*NL*
one
sees
printed
at
the
head
of
an
old
play
,
for
its
performance
in
*NL*
the
provinces
-RRB-
to
the
drama
of
my
undressing
,
as
though
all
Combray
had
*NL*
consisted
of
but
two
floors
joined
by
a
slender
staircase
,
and
as
though
*NL*
there
had
been
no
time
there
but
seven
o'clock
at
night
.
I
must
own
*NL*
that
I
could
have
assured
any
questioner
that
Combray
did
include
other
*NL*
scenes
and
did
exist
at
other
hours
than
these
.
But
since
the
facts
*NL*
which
I
should
then
have
recalled
would
have
been
prompted
only
by
an
*NL*
exercise
of
the
will
,
by
my
intellectual
memory
,
and
since
the
pictures
*NL*
which
that
kind
of
memory
shews
us
of
the
past
preserve
nothing
of
*NL*
the
past
itself
,
I
should
never
have
had
any
wish
to
ponder
over
this
*NL*
residue
of
Combray
.
To
me
it
was
in
reality
all
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Permanently
dead
?
Very
possibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
large
element
of
hazard
in
these
matters
,
and
a
second
*NL*
hazard
,
that
of
our
own
death
,
often
prevents
us
from
awaiting
for
any
*NL*
length
of
time
the
favours
of
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
feel
that
there
is
much
to
be
said
for
the
Celtic
belief
that
the
*NL*
souls
of
those
whom
we
have
lost
are
held
captive
in
some
inferior
*NL*
being
,
in
an
animal
,
in
a
plant
,
in
some
inanimate
object
,
and
so
*NL*
effectively
lost
to
us
until
the
day
-LRB-
which
to
many
never
comes
-RRB-
when
we
*NL*
happen
to
pass
by
the
tree
or
to
obtain
possession
of
the
object
which
*NL*
forms
their
prison
.
Then
they
start
and
tremble
,
they
call
us
by
our
*NL*
name
,
and
as
soon
as
we
have
recognised
their
voice
the
spell
is
broken
.
*NL*
We
have
delivered
them
:
they
have
overcome
death
and
return
to
share
our
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
it
is
with
our
own
past
.
It
is
a
labour
in
vain
to
attempt
to
*NL*
recapture
it
:
all
the
efforts
of
our
intellect
must
prove
futile
.
*NL*
The
past
is
hidden
somewhere
outside
the
realm
,
beyond
the
reach
of
*NL*
intellect
,
in
some
material
object
-LRB-
in
the
sensation
which
that
material
*NL*
object
will
give
us
-RRB-
which
we
do
not
suspect
.
And
as
for
that
object
,
*NL*
it
depends
on
chance
whether
we
come
upon
it
or
not
before
we
ourselves
*NL*
must
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
years
had
elapsed
during
which
nothing
of
Combray
,
save
what
was
*NL*
comprised
in
the
theatre
and
the
drama
of
my
going
to
bed
there
,
had
*NL*
any
existence
for
me
,
when
one
day
in
winter
,
as
I
came
home
,
my
*NL*
mother
,
seeing
that
I
was
cold
,
offered
me
some
tea
,
a
thing
I
did
*NL*
not
ordinarily
take
.
I
declined
at
first
,
and
then
,
for
no
particular
*NL*
reason
,
changed
my
mind
.
She
sent
out
for
one
of
those
short
,
plump
*NL*
little
cakes
called
`
petites
madeleines
,
'
which
look
as
though
they
*NL*
had
been
moulded
in
the
fluted
scallop
of
a
pilgrim
's
shell
.
And
soon
,
*NL*
mechanically
,
weary
after
a
dull
day
with
the
prospect
of
a
depressing
*NL*
morrow
,
I
raised
to
my
lips
a
spoonful
of
the
tea
in
which
I
had
soaked
*NL*
a
morsel
of
the
cake
.
No
sooner
had
the
warm
liquid
,
and
the
crumbs
with
*NL*
it
,
touched
my
palate
than
a
shudder
ran
through
my
whole
body
,
and
I
*NL*
stopped
,
intent
upon
the
extraordinary
changes
that
were
taking
place
.
*NL*
An
exquisite
pleasure
had
invaded
my
senses
,
but
individual
,
detached
,
*NL*
with
no
suggestion
of
its
origin
.
And
at
once
the
vicissitudes
of
life
*NL*
had
become
indifferent
to
me
,
its
disasters
innocuous
,
its
brevity
*NL*
illusory
--
this
new
sensation
having
had
on
me
the
effect
which
love
has
*NL*
of
filling
me
with
a
precious
essence
;
or
rather
this
essence
was
not
*NL*
in
me
,
it
was
myself
.
I
had
ceased
now
to
feel
mediocre
,
accidental
,
*NL*
mortal
.
Whence
could
it
have
come
to
me
,
this
all-powerful
joy
?
I
was
*NL*
conscious
that
it
was
connected
with
the
taste
of
tea
and
cake
,
but
that
*NL*
it
infinitely
transcended
those
savours
,
could
not
,
indeed
,
be
of
the
*NL*
same
nature
as
theirs
.
Whence
did
it
come
?
What
did
it
signify
?
How
*NL*
could
I
seize
upon
and
define
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
drink
a
second
mouthful
,
in
which
I
find
nothing
more
than
in
the
*NL*
first
,
a
third
,
which
gives
me
rather
less
than
the
second
.
It
is
time
*NL*
to
stop
;
the
potion
is
losing
its
magic
.
It
is
plain
that
the
object
*NL*
of
my
quest
,
the
truth
,
lies
not
in
the
cup
but
in
myself
.
The
tea
has
*NL*
called
up
in
me
,
but
does
not
itself
understand
,
and
can
only
repeat
*NL*
indefinitely
with
a
gradual
loss
of
strength
,
the
same
testimony
;
which
*NL*
I
,
too
,
can
not
interpret
,
though
I
hope
at
least
to
be
able
to
call
upon
*NL*
the
tea
for
it
again
and
to
find
it
there
presently
,
intact
and
at
my
*NL*
disposal
,
for
my
final
enlightenment
.
I
put
down
my
cup
and
examine
my
*NL*
own
mind
.
It
is
for
it
to
discover
the
truth
.
But
how
?
What
an
abyss
*NL*
of
uncertainty
whenever
the
mind
feels
that
some
part
of
it
has
strayed
*NL*
beyond
its
own
borders
;
when
it
,
the
seeker
,
is
at
once
the
dark
region
*NL*
through
which
it
must
go
seeking
,
where
all
its
equipment
will
avail
it
*NL*
nothing
.
Seek
?
More
than
that
:
create
.
It
is
face
to
face
with
something
*NL*
which
does
not
so
far
exist
,
to
which
it
alone
can
give
reality
and
*NL*
substance
,
which
it
alone
can
bring
into
the
light
of
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
begin
again
to
ask
myself
what
it
could
have
been
,
this
*NL*
unremembered
state
which
brought
with
it
no
logical
proof
of
its
*NL*
existence
,
but
only
the
sense
that
it
was
a
happy
,
that
it
was
a
*NL*
real
state
in
whose
presence
other
states
of
consciousness
melted
and
*NL*
vanished
.
I
decide
to
attempt
to
make
it
reappear
.
I
retrace
my
thoughts
*NL*
to
the
moment
at
which
I
drank
the
first
spoonful
of
tea
.
I
find
again
*NL*
the
same
state
,
illumined
by
no
fresh
light
.
I
compel
my
mind
to
make
*NL*
one
further
effort
,
to
follow
and
recapture
once
again
the
fleeting
*NL*
sensation
.
And
that
nothing
may
interrupt
it
in
its
course
I
shut
out
*NL*
every
obstacle
,
every
extraneous
idea
,
I
stop
my
ears
and
inhibit
all
*NL*
attention
to
the
sounds
which
come
from
the
next
room
.
And
then
,
feeling
*NL*
that
my
mind
is
growing
fatigued
without
having
any
success
to
report
,
*NL*
I
compel
it
for
a
change
to
enjoy
that
distraction
which
I
have
just
*NL*
denied
it
,
to
think
of
other
things
,
to
rest
and
refresh
itself
before
*NL*
the
supreme
attempt
.
And
then
for
the
second
time
I
clear
an
empty
*NL*
space
in
front
of
it
.
I
place
in
position
before
my
mind
's
eye
the
still
*NL*
recent
taste
of
that
first
mouthful
,
and
I
feel
something
start
within
*NL*
me
,
something
that
leaves
its
resting-place
and
attempts
to
rise
,
*NL*
something
that
has
been
embedded
like
an
anchor
at
a
great
depth
;
I
*NL*
do
not
know
yet
what
it
is
,
but
I
can
feel
it
mounting
slowly
;
I
can
*NL*
measure
the
resistance
,
I
can
hear
the
echo
of
great
spaces
traversed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Undoubtedly
what
is
thus
palpitating
in
the
depths
of
my
being
must
*NL*
be
the
image
,
the
visual
memory
which
,
being
linked
to
that
taste
,
has
*NL*
tried
to
follow
it
into
my
conscious
mind
.
But
its
struggles
are
too
*NL*
far
off
,
too
much
confused
;
scarcely
can
I
perceive
the
colourless
*NL*
reflection
in
which
are
blended
the
uncapturable
whirling
medley
of
*NL*
radiant
hues
,
and
I
can
not
distinguish
its
form
,
can
not
invite
it
,
as
*NL*
the
one
possible
interpreter
,
to
translate
to
me
the
evidence
of
its
*NL*
contemporary
,
its
inseparable
paramour
,
the
taste
of
cake
soaked
in
tea
;
*NL*
can
not
ask
it
to
inform
me
what
special
circumstance
is
in
question
,
of
*NL*
what
period
in
my
past
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
it
ultimately
reach
the
clear
surface
of
my
consciousness
,
this
*NL*
memory
,
this
old
,
dead
moment
which
the
magnetism
of
an
identical
moment
*NL*
has
travelled
so
far
to
importune
,
to
disturb
,
to
raise
up
out
of
the
*NL*
very
depths
of
my
being
?
I
can
not
tell
.
Now
that
I
feel
nothing
,
it
has
*NL*
stopped
,
has
perhaps
gone
down
again
into
its
darkness
,
from
which
who
*NL*
can
say
whether
it
will
ever
rise
?
Ten
times
over
I
must
essay
the
task
,
*NL*
must
lean
down
over
the
abyss
.
And
each
time
the
natural
laziness
which
*NL*
deters
us
from
every
difficult
enterprise
,
every
work
of
importance
,
has
*NL*
urged
me
to
leave
the
thing
alone
,
to
drink
my
tea
and
to
think
merely
*NL*
of
the
worries
of
to-day
and
of
my
hopes
for
to-morrow
,
which
let
*NL*
themselves
be
pondered
over
without
effort
or
distress
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
the
memory
returns
.
The
taste
was
that
of
the
little
crumb
*NL*
of
madeleine
which
on
Sunday
mornings
at
Combray
-LRB-
because
on
those
*NL*
mornings
I
did
not
go
out
before
church-time
-RRB-
,
when
I
went
to
say
good
*NL*
day
to
her
in
her
bedroom
,
my
aunt
Léonie
used
to
give
me
,
dipping
it
*NL*
first
in
her
own
cup
of
real
or
of
lime-flower
tea
.
The
sight
of
the
*NL*
little
madeleine
had
recalled
nothing
to
my
mind
before
I
tasted
it
;
*NL*
perhaps
because
I
had
so
often
seen
such
things
in
the
interval
,
without
*NL*
tasting
them
,
on
the
trays
in
pastry-cooks
'
windows
,
that
their
image
*NL*
had
dissociated
itself
from
those
Combray
days
to
take
its
place
among
*NL*
others
more
recent
;
perhaps
because
of
those
memories
,
so
long
abandoned
*NL*
and
put
out
of
mind
,
nothing
now
survived
,
everything
was
scattered
;
the
*NL*
forms
of
things
,
including
that
of
the
little
scallop-shell
of
pastry
,
*NL*
so
richly
sensual
under
its
severe
,
religious
folds
,
were
either
*NL*
obliterated
or
had
been
so
long
dormant
as
to
have
lost
the
power
of
*NL*
expansion
which
would
have
allowed
them
to
resume
their
place
in
my
*NL*
consciousness
.
But
when
from
a
long-distant
past
nothing
subsists
,
after
*NL*
the
people
are
dead
,
after
the
things
are
broken
and
scattered
,
still
,
*NL*
alone
,
more
fragile
,
but
with
more
vitality
,
more
unsubstantial
,
more
*NL*
persistent
,
more
faithful
,
the
smell
and
taste
of
things
remain
poised
a
*NL*
long
time
,
like
souls
,
ready
to
remind
us
,
waiting
and
hoping
for
their
*NL*
moment
,
amid
the
ruins
of
all
the
rest
;
and
bear
unfaltering
,
in
the
*NL*
tiny
and
almost
impalpable
drop
of
their
essence
,
the
vast
structure
of
*NL*
recollection
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
once
I
had
recognized
the
taste
of
the
crumb
of
madeleine
soaked
in
*NL*
her
decoction
of
lime-flowers
which
my
aunt
used
to
give
me
-LRB-
although
I
*NL*
did
not
yet
know
and
must
long
postpone
the
discovery
of
why
this
memory
*NL*
made
me
so
happy
-RRB-
immediately
the
old
grey
house
upon
the
street
,
where
*NL*
her
room
was
,
rose
up
like
the
scenery
of
a
theatre
to
attach
itself
to
*NL*
the
little
pavilion
,
opening
on
to
the
garden
,
which
had
been
built
out
*NL*
behind
it
for
my
parents
-LRB-
the
isolated
panel
which
until
that
moment
had
*NL*
been
all
that
I
could
see
-RRB-
;
and
with
the
house
the
town
,
from
morning
to
*NL*
night
and
in
all
weathers
,
the
Square
where
I
was
sent
before
luncheon
,
*NL*
the
streets
along
which
I
used
to
run
errands
,
the
country
roads
we
took
*NL*
when
it
was
fine
.
And
just
as
the
Japanese
amuse
themselves
by
filling
*NL*
a
porcelain
bowl
with
water
and
steeping
in
it
little
crumbs
of
paper
*NL*
which
until
then
are
without
character
or
form
,
but
,
the
moment
they
*NL*
become
wet
,
stretch
themselves
and
bend
,
take
on
colour
and
distinctive
*NL*
shape
,
become
flowers
or
houses
or
people
,
permanent
and
recognisable
,
*NL*
so
in
that
moment
all
the
flowers
in
our
garden
and
in
M.
Swann
's
park
,
*NL*
and
the
water-lilies
on
the
Vivonne
and
the
good
folk
of
the
village
and
*NL*
their
little
dwellings
and
the
parish
church
and
the
whole
of
Combray
*NL*
and
of
its
surroundings
,
taking
their
proper
shapes
and
growing
solid
,
*NL*
sprang
into
being
,
town
and
gardens
alike
,
from
my
cup
of
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
COMBRAY
*NL*
*NL*
Combray
at
a
distance
,
from
a
twenty-mile
radius
,
as
we
used
to
see
it
*NL*
from
the
railway
when
we
arrived
there
every
year
in
Holy
Week
,
was
no
*NL*
more
than
a
church
epitomising
the
town
,
representing
it
,
speaking
of
it
*NL*
and
for
it
to
the
horizon
,
and
as
one
drew
near
,
gathering
close
about
*NL*
its
long
,
dark
cloak
,
sheltering
from
the
wind
,
on
the
open
plain
,
as
*NL*
a
shepherd
gathers
his
sheep
,
the
woolly
grey
backs
of
its
flocking
*NL*
houses
,
which
a
fragment
of
its
mediaeval
ramparts
enclosed
,
here
and
*NL*
there
,
in
an
outline
as
scrupulously
circular
as
that
of
a
little
town
*NL*
in
a
primitive
painting
.
To
live
in
,
Combray
was
a
trifle
depressing
,
*NL*
like
its
streets
,
whose
houses
,
built
of
the
blackened
stone
of
the
*NL*
country
,
fronted
with
outside
steps
,
capped
with
gables
which
projected
*NL*
long
shadows
downwards
,
were
so
dark
that
one
had
,
as
soon
as
the
sun
*NL*
began
to
go
down
,
to
draw
back
the
curtains
in
the
sitting-room
windows
;
*NL*
streets
with
the
solemn
names
of
Saints
,
not
a
few
of
whom
figured
*NL*
in
the
history
of
the
early
lords
of
Combray
,
such
as
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Hilaire
,
the
Rue
Saint-Jacques
,
in
which
my
aunt
's
house
stood
,
*NL*
the
Rue
Sainte-Hildegarde
,
which
ran
past
her
railings
,
and
the
Rue
*NL*
du
Saint-Esprit
,
on
to
which
the
little
garden
gate
opened
;
and
these
*NL*
Combray
streets
exist
in
so
remote
a
quarter
of
my
memory
,
painted
in
*NL*
colours
so
different
from
those
in
which
the
world
is
decked
for
me
*NL*
to-day
,
that
in
fact
one
and
all
of
them
,
and
the
church
which
towered
*NL*
above
them
in
the
Square
,
seem
to
me
now
more
unsubstantial
than
the
*NL*
projections
of
my
magic-lantern
;
while
at
times
I
feel
that
to
be
able
*NL*
to
cross
the
Rue
Saint-Hilaire
again
,
to
engage
a
room
in
the
Rue
de
*NL*
l'Oiseau
,
in
the
old
hostelry
of
the
Oiseau
Flesché
,
from
whose
windows
*NL*
in
the
pavement
used
to
rise
a
smell
of
cooking
which
rises
still
in
*NL*
my
mind
,
now
and
then
,
in
the
same
warm
gusts
of
comfort
,
would
be
to
*NL*
secure
a
contact
with
the
unseen
world
more
marvellously
supernatural
*NL*
than
it
would
be
to
make
Golo
's
acquaintance
and
to
chat
with
Geneviève
*NL*
de
Brabant
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandfather
's
cousin
--
by
courtesy
my
great-aunt
--
with
whom
we
used
*NL*
to
stay
,
was
the
mother
of
that
aunt
Léonie
who
,
since
her
husband
's
-LRB-
my
*NL*
uncle
Octave
's
-RRB-
death
,
had
gradually
declined
to
leave
,
first
Combray
,
*NL*
then
her
house
in
Combray
,
then
her
bedroom
,
and
finally
her
bed
;
*NL*
and
who
now
never
`
came
down
,
'
but
lay
perpetually
in
an
indefinite
*NL*
condition
of
grief
,
physical
exhaustion
,
illness
,
obsessions
,
*NL*
and
religious
observances
.
Her
own
room
looked
out
over
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Jacques
,
which
ran
a
long
way
further
to
end
in
the
Grand-Pré
-LRB-
as
*NL*
distinct
from
the
Petit-Pré
,
a
green
space
in
the
centre
of
the
town
*NL*
where
three
streets
met
-RRB-
and
which
,
monotonous
and
grey
,
with
the
three
*NL*
high
steps
of
stone
before
almost
every
one
of
its
doors
,
seemed
like
a
*NL*
deep
furrow
cut
by
some
sculptor
of
gothic
images
in
the
very
block
of
*NL*
stone
out
of
which
he
had
fashioned
a
Calvary
or
a
Crib
.
My
aunt
's
life
*NL*
was
now
practically
confined
to
two
adjoining
rooms
,
in
one
of
which
she
*NL*
would
rest
in
the
afternoon
while
they
,
aired
the
other
.
They
were
rooms
*NL*
of
that
country
order
which
-LRB-
just
as
in
certain
climes
whole
tracts
of
*NL*
air
or
ocean
are
illuminated
or
scented
by
myriads
of
protozoa
which
*NL*
we
can
not
see
-RRB-
fascinate
our
sense
of
smell
with
the
countless
odours
*NL*
springing
from
their
own
special
virtues
,
wisdom
,
habits
,
a
whole
secret
*NL*
system
of
life
,
invisible
,
superabundant
and
profoundly
moral
,
which
*NL*
their
atmosphere
holds
in
solution
;
smells
natural
enough
indeed
,
and
*NL*
coloured
by
circumstances
as
are
those
of
the
neighbouring
countryside
,
*NL*
but
already
humanised
,
domesticated
,
confined
,
an
exquisite
,
skilful
,
*NL*
limpid
jelly
,
blending
all
the
fruits
of
the
season
which
have
left
*NL*
the
orchard
for
the
store-room
,
smells
changing
with
the
year
,
but
*NL*
plenishing
,
domestic
smells
,
which
compensate
for
the
sharpness
of
hoar
*NL*
frost
with
the
sweet
savour
of
warm
bread
,
smells
lazy
and
punctual
as
*NL*
a
village
clock
,
roving
smells
,
pious
smells
;
rejoicing
in
a
peace
which
*NL*
brings
only
an
increase
of
anxiety
,
and
in
a
prosiness
which
serves
as
*NL*
a
deep
source
of
poetry
to
the
stranger
who
passes
through
their
midst
*NL*
without
having
lived
amongst
them
.
The
air
of
those
rooms
was
saturated
*NL*
with
the
fine
bouquet
of
a
silence
so
nourishing
,
so
succulent
that
I
*NL*
could
not
enter
them
without
a
sort
of
greedy
enjoyment
,
particularly
on
*NL*
those
first
mornings
,
chilly
still
,
of
the
Easter
holidays
,
when
I
could
*NL*
taste
it
more
fully
,
because
I
had
just
arrived
then
at
Combray
:
before
*NL*
I
went
in
to
wish
my
aunt
good
day
I
would
be
kept
waiting
a
little
time
*NL*
in
the
outer
room
,
where
the
sun
,
a
wintry
sun
still
,
had
crept
in
to
*NL*
warm
itself
before
the
fire
,
lighted
already
between
its
two
brick
sides
*NL*
and
plastering
all
the
room
and
everything
in
it
with
a
smell
of
soot
,
*NL*
making
the
room
like
one
of
those
great
open
hearths
which
one
finds
in
*NL*
the
country
,
or
one
of
the
canopied
mantelpieces
in
old
castles
under
*NL*
which
one
sits
hoping
that
in
the
world
outside
it
is
raining
or
*NL*
snowing
,
hoping
almost
for
a
catastrophic
deluge
to
add
the
romance
of
*NL*
shelter
and
security
to
the
comfort
of
a
snug
retreat
;
I
would
turn
to
*NL*
and
fro
between
the
prayer-desk
and
the
stamped
velvet
armchairs
,
each
*NL*
one
always
draped
in
its
crocheted
antimacassar
,
while
the
fire
,
baking
*NL*
like
a
pie
the
appetising
smells
with
which
the
air
of
the
room
,
was
*NL*
thickly
clotted
,
which
the
dewy
and
sunny
freshness
of
the
morning
had
*NL*
already
`
raised
'
and
started
to
`
set
,
'
puffed
them
and
glazed
them
and
*NL*
fluted
them
and
swelled
them
into
an
invisible
though
not
impalpable
*NL*
country
cake
,
an
immense
puff-pastry
,
in
which
,
barely
waiting
to
savour
*NL*
the
crustier
,
more
delicate
,
more
respectable
,
but
also
drier
smells
*NL*
of
the
cupboard
,
the
chest-of-drawers
,
and
the
patterned
wall-paper
*NL*
I
always
returned
with
an
unconfessed
gluttony
to
bury
myself
in
the
*NL*
nondescript
,
resinous
,
dull
,
indigestible
,
and
fruity
smell
of
the
*NL*
flowered
quilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
next
room
I
could
hear
my
aunt
talking
quietly
to
herself
.
She
*NL*
never
spoke
save
in
low
tones
,
because
she
believed
that
there
was
*NL*
something
broken
in
her
head
and
floating
loose
there
,
which
she
might
*NL*
displace
by
talking
too
loud
;
but
she
never
remained
for
long
,
even
when
*NL*
alone
,
without
saying
something
,
because
she
believed
that
it
was
good
*NL*
for
her
throat
,
and
that
by
keeping
the
blood
there
in
circulation
it
*NL*
would
make
less
frequent
the
chokings
and
other
pains
to
which
she
*NL*
was
liable
;
besides
,
in
the
life
of
complete
inertia
which
she
led
she
*NL*
attached
to
the
least
of
her
sensations
an
extraordinary
importance
,
*NL*
endowed
them
with
a
Protean
ubiquity
which
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
*NL*
keep
them
secret
,
and
,
failing
a
confidant
to
whom
she
might
communicate
*NL*
them
,
she
used
to
promulgate
them
to
herself
in
an
unceasing
monologue
*NL*
which
was
her
sole
form
of
activity
.
Unfortunately
,
having
formed
the
*NL*
habit
of
thinking
aloud
,
she
did
not
always
take
care
to
see
that
there
*NL*
was
no
one
in
the
adjoining
room
,
and
I
would
often
hear
her
saying
*NL*
to
herself
:
``
I
must
not
forget
that
I
never
slept
a
wink
''
--
for
``
never
*NL*
sleeping
a
wink
''
was
her
great
claim
to
distinction
,
and
one
admitted
*NL*
and
respected
in
our
household
vocabulary
;
in
the
morning
Françoise
*NL*
would
not
`
call
'
her
,
but
would
simply
`
come
to
'
her
;
during
the
day
,
*NL*
when
my
aunt
wished
to
take
a
nap
,
we
used
to
say
just
that
she
wished
*NL*
to
`
be
quiet
'
or
to
`
rest
'
;
and
when
in
conversation
she
so
far
forgot
*NL*
herself
as
to
say
``
what
made
me
wake
up
,
''
or
``
I
dreamed
that
,
''
she
would
*NL*
flush
and
at
once
correct
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
waiting
a
minute
,
I
would
go
in
and
kiss
her
;
Françoise
would
*NL*
be
making
her
tea
;
or
,
if
my
aunt
were
feeling
`
upset
,
'
she
would
ask
*NL*
instead
for
her
't
isane
,
'
and
it
would
be
my
duty
to
shake
out
of
*NL*
the
chemist
's
little
package
on
to
a
plate
the
amount
of
lime-blossom
*NL*
required
for
infusion
in
boiling
water
.
The
drying
of
the
stems
had
*NL*
twisted
them
into
a
fantastic
trellis
,
in
whose
intervals
the
pale
*NL*
flowers
opened
,
as
though
a
painter
had
arranged
them
there
,
grouping
*NL*
them
in
the
most
decorative
poses
.
The
leaves
,
which
had
lost
or
altered
*NL*
their
own
appearance
,
assumed
those
instead
of
the
most
incongruous
*NL*
things
imaginable
,
as
though
the
transparent
wings
of
flies
or
the
blank
*NL*
sides
of
labels
or
the
petals
of
roses
had
been
collected
and
pounded
,
*NL*
or
interwoven
as
birds
weave
the
material
for
their
nests
.
A
*NL*
thousand
trifling
little
details
--
the
charming
prodigality
of
the
*NL*
chemist
--
details
which
would
have
been
eliminated
from
an
artificial
*NL*
preparation
,
gave
me
,
like
a
book
in
which
one
is
astonished
to
read
the
*NL*
name
of
a
person
whom
one
knows
,
the
pleasure
of
finding
that
these
were
*NL*
indeed
real
lime-blossoms
,
like
those
I
had
seen
,
when
coming
from
the
*NL*
train
,
in
the
Avenue
de
la
Gare
,
altered
,
but
only
because
they
were
not
*NL*
imitations
but
the
very
same
blossoms
,
which
had
grown
old
.
And
as
each
*NL*
new
character
is
merely
a
metamorphosis
from
something
older
,
in
these
*NL*
little
grey
balls
I
recognised
green
buds
plucked
before
their
time
;
but
*NL*
beyond
all
else
the
rosy
,
moony
,
tender
glow
which
lit
up
the
blossoms
*NL*
among
the
frail
forest
of
stems
from
which
they
hung
like
little
golden
*NL*
roses
--
marking
,
as
the
radiance
upon
an
old
wall
still
marks
the
place
*NL*
of
a
vanished
fresco
,
the
difference
between
those
parts
of
the
tree
*NL*
which
had
and
those
which
had
not
been
`
in
bloom
'
--
shewed
me
that
these
*NL*
were
petals
which
,
before
their
flowering-time
,
the
chemist
's
package
*NL*
had
embalmed
on
warm
evenings
of
spring
.
That
rosy
candlelight
was
still
*NL*
their
colour
,
but
half-extinguished
and
deadened
in
the
diminished
life
*NL*
which
was
now
theirs
,
and
which
may
be
called
the
twilight
of
a
flower
.
*NL*
Presently
my
aunt
was
able
to
dip
in
the
boiling
infusion
,
in
which
she
*NL*
would
relish
the
savour
of
dead
or
faded
blossom
,
a
little
madeleine
,
of
*NL*
which
she
would
hold
out
a
piece
to
me
when
it
was
sufficiently
soft
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
side
of
her
bed
stood
a
big
yellow
chest-of-drawers
of
*NL*
lemon-wood
,
and
a
table
which
served
at
once
as
pharmacy
and
as
*NL*
high
altar
,
on
which
,
beneath
a
statue
of
Our
Lady
and
a
bottle
of
*NL*
Vichy-Célestins
,
might
be
found
her
service-books
and
her
medical
*NL*
prescriptions
,
everything
that
she
needed
for
the
performance
,
in
bed
,
*NL*
of
her
duties
to
soul
and
body
,
to
keep
the
proper
times
for
pepsin
and
*NL*
for
vespers
.
On
the
other
side
her
bed
was
bounded
by
the
window
:
she
*NL*
had
the
street
beneath
her
eyes
,
and
would
read
in
it
from
morning
to
*NL*
night
to
divert
the
tedium
of
her
life
,
like
a
Persian
prince
,
the
daily
*NL*
but
immemorial
chronicles
of
Combray
,
which
she
would
discuss
in
detail
*NL*
afterwards
with
Françoise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
have
been
five
minutes
with
my
aunt
before
she
would
send
me
*NL*
away
in
case
I
made
her
tired
.
She
would
hold
out
for
me
to
kiss
her
sad
*NL*
brow
,
pale
and
lifeless
,
on
which
at
this
early
hour
she
would
not
yet
*NL*
have
arranged
the
false
hair
and
through
which
the
bones
shone
like
the
*NL*
points
of
a
crown
of
thorns
--
or
the
beads
of
a
rosary
,
and
she
would
say
*NL*
to
me
:
``
Now
,
my
poor
child
,
you
must
go
away
;
go
and
get
ready
for
*NL*
mass
;
and
if
you
see
Françoise
downstairs
,
tell
her
not
to
stay
too
*NL*
long
amusing
herself
with
you
;
she
must
come
up
soon
to
see
if
I
want
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Françoise
,
who
had
been
for
many
years
in
my
aunt
's
service
and
did
not
*NL*
at
that
time
suspect
that
she
would
one
day
be
transferred
entirely
to
*NL*
ours
,
was
a
little
inclined
to
desert
my
aunt
during
the
months
which
we
*NL*
spent
in
her
house
.
There
had
been
in
my
infancy
,
before
we
first
went
*NL*
to
Combray
,
and
when
my
aunt
Léonie
used
still
to
spend
the
winter
in
*NL*
Paris
with
her
mother
,
a
time
when
I
knew
Françoise
so
little
that
on
*NL*
New
Year
's
Day
,
before
going
into
my
great-aunt
's
house
,
my
mother
put
*NL*
a
five-franc
piece
in
my
hand
and
said
:
``
Now
,
be
careful
.
Do
n't
make
*NL*
any
mistake
.
Wait
until
you
hear
me
say
`
Good
morning
,
Françoise
,
'
and
*NL*
I
touch
your
arm
before
you
give
it
to
her
.
''
No
sooner
had
we
arrived
*NL*
in
my
aunt
's
dark
hall
than
we
saw
in
the
gloom
,
beneath
the
frills
of
a
*NL*
snowy
cap
as
stiff
and
fragile
as
if
it
had
been
made
of
spun
sugar
,
the
*NL*
concentric
waves
of
a
smile
of
anticipatory
gratitude
.
It
was
Françoise
,
*NL*
motionless
and
erect
,
framed
in
the
small
doorway
of
the
corridor
like
*NL*
the
statue
of
a
saint
in
its
niche
.
When
we
had
grown
more
accustomed
to
*NL*
this
religious
darkness
we
could
discern
in
her
features
a
disinterested
*NL*
love
of
all
humanity
,
blended
with
a
tender
respect
for
the
`
upper
*NL*
classes
'
which
raised
to
the
most
honourable
quarter
of
her
heart
the
*NL*
hope
of
receiving
her
due
reward
.
Mamma
pinched
my
arm
sharply
and
said
*NL*
in
a
loud
voice
:
``
Good
morning
,
Françoise
.
''
At
this
signal
my
fingers
*NL*
parted
and
I
let
fall
the
coin
,
which
found
a
receptacle
in
a
confused
*NL*
but
outstretched
hand
.
But
since
we
had
begun
to
go
to
Combray
there
was
*NL*
no
one
I
knew
better
than
Françoise
.
We
were
her
favourites
,
and
in
the
*NL*
first
years
at
least
,
while
she
shewed
the
same
consideration
for
us
*NL*
as
for
my
aunt
,
she
enjoyed
us
with
a
keener
relish
,
because
we
had
,
in
*NL*
addition
to
our
dignity
as
part
of
`
the
family
'
-LRB-
for
she
had
for
those
*NL*
invisible
bonds
by
which
community
of
blood
unites
the
members
of
a
*NL*
family
as
much
respect
as
any
Greek
tragedian
-RRB-
,
the
fresh
charm
of
not
*NL*
being
her
customary
employers
.
And
so
with
what
joy
would
she
welcome
*NL*
us
,
with
what
sorrow
complain
that
the
weather
was
still
so
bad
for
us
,
*NL*
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
,
just
before
Easter
,
when
there
was
often
an
*NL*
icy
wind
;
while
Mamma
inquired
after
her
daughter
and
her
nephews
,
and
*NL*
if
her
grandson
was
good-looking
,
and
what
they
were
going
to
make
of
*NL*
him
,
and
whether
he
took
after
his
granny
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
,
when
no
one
else
was
in
the
room
,
Mamma
,
who
knew
that
Françoise
*NL*
was
still
mourning
for
her
parents
,
who
had
been
dead
for
years
,
would
*NL*
speak
of
them
kindly
,
asking
her
endless
little
questions
about
them
and
*NL*
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
guessed
that
Françoise
was
not
over-fond
of
her
son-in-law
,
and
*NL*
that
he
spoiled
the
pleasure
she
found
in
visiting
her
daughter
,
as
the
*NL*
two
could
not
talk
so
freely
when
he
was
there
.
And
so
one
day
,
when
*NL*
Françoise
was
going
to
their
house
,
some
miles
from
Combray
,
Mamma
said
*NL*
to
her
,
with
a
smile
:
``
Tell
me
,
Françoise
,
if
Julien
has
had
to
go
away
,
*NL*
and
you
have
Marguerite
to
yourself
all
day
,
you
will
be
very
sorry
,
but
*NL*
will
make
the
best
of
it
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Françoise
answered
,
laughing
:
``
Madame
knows
everything
;
Madame
*NL*
is
worse
than
the
X-rays
''
-LRB-
she
pronounced
`
x
'
with
an
affectation
*NL*
of
difficulty
and
with
a
smile
in
deprecation
of
her
,
an
unlettered
*NL*
woman
's
,
daring
to
employ
a
scientific
term
-RRB-
``
they
brought
here
for
Mme.
*NL*
Octave
,
which
see
what
is
in
your
heart
''
--
and
she
went
off
,
disturbed
*NL*
that
anyone
should
be
caring
about
her
,
perhaps
anxious
that
we
should
*NL*
not
see
her
in
tears
:
Mamma
was
the
first
person
who
had
given
her
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
feeling
that
her
peasant
existence
,
with
its
simple
joys
*NL*
and
sorrows
,
might
offer
some
interest
,
might
be
a
source
of
grief
or
*NL*
pleasure
to
some
one
other
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
resigned
herself
to
doing
without
Françoise
to
some
extent
*NL*
during
our
visits
,
knowing
how
much
my
mother
appreciated
the
services
*NL*
of
so
active
and
intelligent
a
maid
,
one
who
looked
as
smart
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
in
her
kitchen
,
under
a
cap
whose
stiff
and
*NL*
dazzling
frills
seemed
to
be
made
of
porcelain
,
as
when
dressed
for
*NL*
churchgoing
;
who
did
everything
in
the
right
way
,
who
toiled
like
a
*NL*
horse
,
whether
she
was
well
or
ill
,
but
without
noise
,
without
the
*NL*
appearance
of
doing
anything
;
the
only
one
of
my
aunt
's
maids
who
when
*NL*
Mamma
asked
for
hot
water
or
black
coffee
would
bring
them
actually
*NL*
boiling
;
she
was
one
of
those
servants
who
in
a
household
seem
least
*NL*
satisfactory
,
at
first
,
to
a
stranger
,
doubtless
because
they
take
*NL*
no
pains
to
make
a
conquest
of
him
and
shew
him
no
special
attention
,
*NL*
knowing
very
well
that
they
have
no
real
need
of
him
,
that
he
will
cease
*NL*
to
be
invited
to
the
house
sooner
than
they
will
be
dismissed
from
it
;
*NL*
who
,
on
the
other
hand
,
cling
with
most
fidelity
to
those
masters
and
*NL*
mistresses
who
have
tested
and
proved
their
real
capacity
,
and
do
not
*NL*
look
for
that
superficial
responsiveness
,
that
slavish
affability
,
*NL*
which
may
impress
a
stranger
favourably
,
but
often
conceals
an
utter
*NL*
barrenness
of
spirit
in
which
no
amount
of
training
can
produce
the
*NL*
least
trace
of
individuality
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Françoise
,
having
seen
that
my
parents
had
everything
they
*NL*
required
,
first
went
upstairs
again
to
give
my
aunt
her
pepsin
and
to
*NL*
find
out
from
her
what
she
would
take
for
luncheon
,
very
few
mornings
*NL*
pased
but
she
was
called
upon
to
give
an
opinion
,
or
to
furnish
an
*NL*
explanation
,
in
regard
to
some
important
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
fancy
,
Françoise
,
Mme.
Goupil
went
by
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
late
to
fetch
her
sister
:
if
she
loses
any
more
time
on
the
way
I
*NL*
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
she
got
in
after
the
Elevation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
'd
be
nothing
wonderful
in
that
,
''
would
be
the
answer
.
Or
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Françoise
,
if
you
had
come
in
five
minutes
ago
,
you
would
have
seen
*NL*
Mme.
Imbert
go
past
with
some
asparagus
twice
the
size
of
what
mother
*NL*
Callot
has
:
do
try
to
find
out
from
her
cook
where
she
got
them
.
You
*NL*
know
you
've
been
putting
asparagus
in
all
your
sauces
this
spring
;
you
*NL*
might
be
able
to
get
some
like
these
for
our
visitors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
be
surprised
if
they
came
from
the
Curé
's
,
''
Françoise
would
*NL*
say
,
and
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
would
n't
,
my
poor
Françoise
,
''
my
aunt
would
reply
,
raising
*NL*
her
shoulders
.
``
From
the
Curé
's
,
indeed
!
You
know
quite
well
that
he
*NL*
can
never
grow
anything
but
wretched
little
twigs
of
asparagus
,
not
*NL*
asparagus
at
all
.
I
tell
you
these
ones
were
as
thick
as
my
arm
.
Not
*NL*
your
arm
,
of
course
,
but
my-poor
arm
,
which
has
grown
so
much
thinner
*NL*
again
this
year
.
''
Or
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Françoise
,
did
n't
you
hear
that
bell
just
now
!
It
split
my
head

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Mme.
Octave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
poor
girl
,
your
skull
must
be
very
thick
;
you
may
thank
God
for
*NL*
that
.
It
was
Maguelone
come
to
fetch
Dr.
Piperaud
.
He
came
out
with
her
*NL*
at
once
and
they
went
off
along
the
Rue
de
l'Oiseau
.
There
must
be
some
*NL*
child
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
dear
;
the
poor
little
creature
!
''
would
come
with
a
sigh
from
*NL*
Françoise
,
who
could
not
hear
of
any
calamity
befalling
a
person
unknown
*NL*
to
her
,
even
in
some
distant
part
of
the
world
,
without
beginning
to
*NL*
lament
.
Or
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Françoise
,
for
whom
did
they
toll
the
passing-bell
just
now
?
Oh
dear
,
*NL*
of
course
,
it
would
be
for
Mme.
Rousseau
.
And
to
think
that
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
that
she
passed
away
the
other
night
.
Indeed
,
it
is
time
the
*NL*
Lord
called
me
home
too
;
I
do
n't
know
what
has
become
of
my
head
since
I
*NL*
lost
my
poor
Octave
.
But
I
am
wasting
your
time
,
my
good
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
no
,
Mme.
Octave
,
my
time
is
not
so
precious
;
whoever
made
our
*NL*
time
did
n't
sell
it
to
us
.
I
am
just
going
to
see
that
my
fire
has
n't
*NL*
gone
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
Françoise
and
my
aunt
made
a
critical
valuation
between
*NL*
them
,
in
the
course
of
these
morning
sessions
,
of
the
earliest
*NL*
happenings
of
the
day
.
But
sometimes
these
happenings
assumed
so
*NL*
mysterious
or
so
alarming
an
air
that
my
aunt
felt
she
could
not
wait
*NL*
until
it
was
time
for
Françoise
to
come
upstairs
,
and
then
a
formidable
*NL*
and
quadruple
peal
would
resound
through
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Mme.
Octave
,
it
is
not
time
for
your
pepsin

Françoise
would
*NL*
begin
.
``
Are
you
feeling
faint
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
Françoise
,
''
my
aunt
would
reply
,
``
that
is
to
say
,
yes

*NL*
for
you
know
well
that
there
is
very
seldom
a
time
when
I
do
n't
feel
*NL*
faint
;
one
day
I
shall
pass
away
like
Mme.
Rousseau
,
before
I
know
where
*NL*
I
am
;
but
that
is
not
why
I
rang
.
Would
you
believe
that
I
have
just
*NL*
seen
,
as
plainly
as
I
see
you
,
Mme.
Goupil
with
a
little
girl
I
did
n't
*NL*
know
at
all

Run
and
get
a
pennyworth
of
salt
from
Camus
.
It
's
not
often

that
Théodore
ca
n't
tell
you
who
a
person
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
that
must
be
M.
Pupin

Françoise
would
say
,
preferring
*NL*
to
stick
to
an
immediate
explanation
,
since
she
had
been
perhaps
twice
*NL*
already
into
Camus
's
shop
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Pupin
's
daughter

my
poor
Françoise

you
think
I
should
not
have
recognised
M.
Pupin
's
daughter

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do

one
who
goes
to
school
at
Jouy

I
seem
to
have
seen
her
once
already
his
*NL*
morning

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
that

what
it

my

Yes

that

it

No

she
will
have
come
*NL*
over

But
then
we
shall
soon
see
Mme.
Sazerat
come
*NL*
along
and
ring
her
sister
's
door-bell
,
for
her
luncheon
.
That
will
be
*NL*
it

I
saw
the
boy
from
Galopin

go
by
with
a
tart

You
will
see

tart
was

not
so
early
as
it
was

would
be
the
answer
,
for
Françoise
,
who
was
*NL*
anxious
to
retire
downstairs
to
look
after
our
own
meal
,
was
not
sorry
*NL*
to
leave
my
aunt
with
the
prospect
of
such
a
distraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
not
before
midday
!
''
my
aunt
would
reply
in
a
tone
of
resignation
,
*NL*
darting
an
uneasy
glance
at
the
clock
,
but
stealthily
,
so
as
not
to
let
*NL*
it
be
seen
that
she
,
who
had
renounced
all
earthly
joys
,
yet
found
a
*NL*
keen
satisfaction
in
learning
that
Mme.
Goupil
was
expecting
company
to
*NL*
luncheon
,
though
,
alas
,
she
must
wait
a
little
more
than
an
hour
still
*NL*
before
enjoying
the
spectacle
.
``
And
it
will
come
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
my
luncheon

she
would
murmur
to
herself

Her
luncheon
was
such
a
*NL*
distraction
in
itself
that
she
did
not
like
any
other
to
come
at
the
*NL*
same
time
.
``
At

,
you
will
not
forget
to
give

eggs

one
of

''
These
were
the
only
plates
which
had
pictures
*NL*
on
them
and
my
aunt
used
to
amuse
herself
at
every
meal
by
reading
the
*NL*
description
on
whichever
might
have
been
sent
up
to
her
.
She
would
*NL*
put
on
her
spectacles
and
spell
out
:
``
Ali
Baba
and
the
Forty
Thieves
,
''
*NL*
``
Aladdin

or
the
Wonderful
Lamp

and
smile
,
and
say
``
Very

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
as
well
go
across
to
Camus

Françoise
would
hazard
,
seeing
*NL*
that
my

had
no
longer
any
intention
of
sending
her
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

not
worth

certain

My
*NL*
poor
Françoise
,
I
am
sorry
to
have
made
you
come
upstairs
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
for
nothing
,
as
my
aunt
well
knew
,
that
she
had
rung
for
*NL*
Françoise
,
since
at
Combray
a
person
whom
one
`
did
n't
know
at
all
'
was
*NL*
as
incredible
a
being
as
any
mythological
deity
,
and
it
was
apt
to
be
*NL*
forgotten
that
after
each
occasion
on
which
there
had
appeared
in
the
*NL*
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
or
in
the
Square
one
of
these
bewildering
phenomena
,
*NL*
careful
and
exhaustive
researches
had
invariably
reduced
the
fabulous
*NL*
monster
to
the
proportions
of
a
person
whom
one
`
did
know
,
'
either
*NL*
personally
or
in
the
abstract
,
in
his
or
her
civil
status
as
being
more
*NL*
or
less
closely
related
to
some
family
in
Combray
.
It
would
turn
out
to
*NL*
be
Mme.
Sauton
's
son
discharged
from
the
army
,
or
the
Abbé
Perdreau
's
*NL*
niece
come
home
from
her
convent
,
or
the
Curé
's
brother
,
a
tax-collector
*NL*
at
Châteaudun
,
who
had
just
retired
on
a
pension
or
had
come
over
to
*NL*
Combray
for
the
holidays
.
On
first
noticing
them
you
have
been
impressed
*NL*
by
the
thought
that
there
might
be
in
Combray
people
whom
you
`
did
n't
*NL*
know
at
all
,
'
simply
because
,
you
had
failed
to
recognise
or
identify
*NL*
them
at
once
.
And
yet
long
beforehand
Mme.
Sauton
and
the
Curé
had
given
*NL*
warning
that
they
expected
their
`
strangers
.
'
In
the
evening
,
when
I
*NL*
came
in
and
went
upstairs
to
tell
my
aunt
the
incidents
of
our
walk
,
if
*NL*
I
was
rash
enough
to
say
to
her
that
we
had
passed
,
near
the
Pont-Vieux
,
*NL*
a
man
whom
my
grandfather
did
n't
know
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
grandfather
did
n't
know
at
all
!
''
she
would
exclaim
.
``
That
's
a
*NL*
likely
story
.
''
None
the
less
,
she
would
be
a
little
disturbed
by
*NL*
the
news
,
she
would
wish
to
have
the
details
correctly
,
and
so
my
*NL*
grandfather
would
be
summoned
.
``
Who
can
it
have
been
that
you
passed
*NL*
near
the
Pont-Vieux
,
uncle
?
A
man
you
did
n't
know
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
I
did
,
''
my
grandfather
would
answer
;
``
it
was
Prosper
,
*NL*
Mme.
Bouilleboeuf
's
gardener
's
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
!
''
my
aunt
would
say
,
calm
again
but
slightly
flushed
still
;
*NL*
``
and
the
boy
told
me
that
you
had
passed
a
man
you
did
n't
know
at
all
!
''
*NL*
After
which
I
would
be
warned
to
be
more
careful
of
what
I
said
,
and
not
*NL*
to
upset
my
aunt
so
by
thoughtless
remarks
.
Everyone
was
so
well
known
*NL*
in
Combray
,
animals
as
well
as
people
,
that
if
my
aunt
had
happened
to
*NL*
see
a
dog
go
by
which
she
`
did
n't
know
at
all
'
she
would
think
about
it
*NL*
incessantly
,
devoting
to
the
solution
of
the
incomprehensible
problem
*NL*
all
her
inductive
talent
and
her
leisure
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
be
Mme.
Sazerat
's
dog
,
''
Françoise
would
suggest
,
without
any
*NL*
real
conviction
,
but
in
the
hope
of
peace
,
and
so
that
my
aunt
should
*NL*
not
`
split
her
head
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
if
I
did
n't
know
Mme.
Sazerat
's
dog
!
''
--
for
my
aunt
's
critical
mind
*NL*
would
not
so
easily
admit
any
fresh
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
that
will
be
the
new
dog
M.
Galopin
has
brought
her
from
*NL*
Lisieux
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
that
's
what
it
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
,
it
's
a
most
engaging
animal
,
''
Françoise
would
go
on
,
having
*NL*
got
the
story
from
Théodore
,
``
as
clever
as
a
Christian
,
always
in
a
good
*NL*
temper
,
always
friendly
,
always
everything
that
's
nice
.
It
's
not
often
*NL*
you
see
an
animal
so
well-behaved
at
that
age
.
Mme.
Octave
,
it
's
high
*NL*
time
I
left
you
;
I
ca
n't
afford
to
stay
here
amusing
myself
;
look
,
it
's
*NL*
nearly
ten
o'clock
and
my
fire
not
lighted
yet
,
and
I
've
still
to
dress
*NL*
the
asparagus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Françoise
,
more
asparagus
!
It
's
a
regular
disease
of
asparagus
*NL*
you
have
got
this
year
:
you
will
make
our
Parisians
sick
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Madame
Octave
,
they
like
it
well
enough
.
They
'll
be
coming
back
*NL*
from
church
soon
as
hungry
as
hunters
,
and
they
wo
n't
eat
it
out
of
the
*NL*
back
of
their
spoons
,
you
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Church
!
why
,
they
must
be
there
now
;
you
'd
better
not
lose
any
time
.
Go
*NL*
and
look
after
your
luncheon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
my
aunt
gossiped
on
in
this
way
with
Françoise
I
would
have
*NL*
accompanied
my
parents
to
mass
.
How
I
loved
it
:
how
clearly
I
can
see
it
*NL*
still
,
our
church
at
Combray
!
The
old
porch
by
which
we
went
in
,
black
,
*NL*
and
full
of
holes
as
a
cullender
,
was
worn
out
of
shape
and
deeply
*NL*
furrowed
at
the
sides
-LRB-
as
also
was
the
holy
water
stoup
to
which
it
led
*NL*
us
-RRB-
just
as
if
the
gentle
grazing
touch
of
the
cloaks
of
peasant-women
*NL*
going
into
the
church
,
and
of
their
fingers
dipping
into
the
water
,
had
*NL*
managed
by
agelong
repetition
to
acquire
a
destructive
force
,
to
impress
*NL*
itself
on
the
stone
,
to
carve
ruts
in
it
like
those
made
by
cart-wheels
*NL*
upon
stone
gate-posts
against
which
they
are
driven
every
day
.
Its
*NL*
memorial
stones
,
beneath
which
the
noble
dust
of
the
Abbots
of
Combray
,
*NL*
who
were
buried
there
,
furnished
the
choir
with
a
sort
of
spiritual
*NL*
pavement
,
were
themselves
no
longer
hard
and
lifeless
matter
,
for
time
*NL*
had
softened
and
sweetened
them
,
and
had
made
them
melt
like
honey
*NL*
and
flow
beyond
their
proper
margins
,
either
surging
out
in
a
milky
,
*NL*
frothing
wave
,
washing
from
its
place
a
florid
gothic
capital
,
drowning
*NL*
the
white
violets
of
the
marble
floor
;
or
else
reabsorbed
into
their
*NL*
limits
,
contracting
still
further
a
crabbed
Latin
inscription
,
*NL*
bringing
a
fresh
touch
of
fantasy
into
the
arrangement
of
its
curtailed
*NL*
characters
,
closing
together
two
letters
of
some
word
of
which
the
rest
*NL*
were
disproportionately
scattered
.
Its
windows
were
never
so
brilliant
*NL*
as
on
days
when
the
sun
scarcely
shone
,
so
that
if
it
was
dull
outside
*NL*
you
might
be
certain
of
fine
weather
in
church
.
One
of
them
was
*NL*
filled
from
top
to
bottom
by
a
solitary
figure
,
like
the
king
on
a
*NL*
playing-card
,
who
lived
up
there
beneath
his
canopy
of
stone
,
between
*NL*
earth
and
heaven
;
and
in
the
blue
light
of
its
slanting
shadow
,
on
*NL*
weekdays
sometimes
,
at
noon
,
when
there
was
no
service
-LRB-
at
one
of
those
*NL*
rare
moments
when
the
airy
,
empty
church
,
more
human
somehow
and
more
*NL*
luxurious
with
the
sun
shewing
off
all
its
rich
furnishings
,
seemed
to
*NL*
have
almost
a
habitable
air
,
like
the
hall
--
all
sculptured
stone
and
*NL*
painted
glass
--
of
some
mediaeval
mansion
-RRB-
,
you
might
see
Mme.
Sazerat
*NL*
kneel
for
an
instant
,
laying
down
on
the
chair
beside
her
own
a
neatly
*NL*
corded
parcel
of
little
cakes
which
she
had
just
bought
at
the
baker
's
*NL*
and
was
taking
home
for
her
luncheon
.
In
another
,
a
mountain
of
rosy
*NL*
snow
,
at
whose
foot
a
battle
was
being
fought
,
seemed
to
have
frozen
the
*NL*
window
also
,
which
it
swelled
and
distorted
with
its
cloudy
sleet
,
like
*NL*
a
pane
to
which
snowflakes
have
drifted
and
clung
,
but
flakes
illumined
*NL*
by
a
sunrise
--
the
same
,
doubtless
,
which
purpled
the
reredos
of
the
*NL*
altar
with
tints
so
fresh
that
they
seemed
rather
to
be
thrown
on
it
for
*NL*
a
moment
by
a
light
shining
from
outside
and
shortly
to
be
extinguished
*NL*
than
painted
and
permanently
fastened
on
the
stone
.
And
all
of
them
*NL*
were
so
old
that
you
could
see
,
here
and
there
,
their
silvery
antiquity
*NL*
sparkling
with
the
dust
of
centuries
and
shewing
in
its
threadbare
*NL*
brilliance
the
very
cords
of
their
lovely
tapestry
of
glass
.
There
*NL*
was
one
among
them
which
was
a
tall
panel
composed
of
a
hundred
little
*NL*
rectangular
windows
,
of
blue
principally
,
like
a
great
game
of
patience
*NL*
of
the
kind
planned
to
beguile
King
Charles
VI
;
but
,
either
because
a
*NL*
ray
of
sunlight
had
gleamed
through
it
or
because
my
own
shifting
vision
*NL*
had
drawn
across
the
window
,
whose
colours
died
away
and
were
rekindled
*NL*
by
turns
,
a
rare
and
transient
fire
--
the
next
instant
it
had
taken
on
*NL*
all
the
iridescence
of
a
peacock
's
tail
,
then
shook
and
wavered
in
a
*NL*
flaming
and
fantastic
shower
,
distilled
and
dropping
from
the
groin
of
*NL*
the
dark
and
rocky
vault
down
the
moist
walls
,
as
though
it
were
*NL*
along
the
bed
of
some
rainbow
grotto
of
sinuous
stalactites
that
I
was
*NL*
following
my
parents
,
who
marched
before
me
,
their
prayer-books
clasped
*NL*
in
their
hands
;
a
moment
later
the
little
lozenge
windows
had
put
on
the
*NL*
deep
transparence
,
the
unbreakable
hardness
of
sapphires
clustered
on
*NL*
some
enormous
breastplate
;
but
beyond
which
could
be
distinguished
,
*NL*
dearer
than
all
such
treasures
,
a
fleeting
smile
from
the
sun
,
which
*NL*
could
be
seen
and
felt
as
well
here
,
in
the
blue
and
gentle
flood
in
*NL*
which
it
washed
the
masonry
,
as
on
the
pavement
of
the
Square
or
the
*NL*
straw
of
the
market-place
;
and
even
on
our
first
Sundays
,
when
we
came
*NL*
down
before
Easter
,
it
would
console
me
for
the
blackness
and
bareness
*NL*
of
the
earth
outside
by
making
burst
into
blossom
,
as
in
some
springtime
*NL*
in
old
history
among
the
heirs
of
Saint
Louis
,
this
dazzling
and
gilded
*NL*
carpet
of
forget-me-nots
in
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
tapestries
of
high
warp
represented
the
coronation
of
Esther
-LRB-
in
*NL*
which
tradition
would
have
it
that
the
weaver
had
given
to
Ahasuerus
the
*NL*
features
of
one
of
the
kings
of
France
and
to
Esther
those
of
a
lady
of
*NL*
Guermantes
whose
lover
he
had
been
-RRB-
;
their
colours
had
melted
into
one
*NL*
another
,
so
as
to
add
expression
,
relief
,
light
to
the
pictures
.
A
touch
*NL*
of
red
over
the
lips
of
Esther
had
strayed
beyond
their
outline
;
the
*NL*
yellow
on
her
dress
was
spread
with
such
unctuous
plumpness
as
to
have
*NL*
acquired
a
kind
of
solidity
,
and
stood
boldly
out
from
the
receding
*NL*
atmosphere
;
while
the
green
of
the
trees
,
which
was
still
bright
in
Silk
*NL*
and
wool
among
the
lower
parts
of
the
panel
,
but
had
quite
`
gone
'
at
the
*NL*
top
,
separated
in
a
paler
scheme
,
above
the
dark
trunks
,
the
yellowing
*NL*
upper
branches
,
tanned
and
half-obliterated
by
the
sharp
though
sidelong
*NL*
rays
of
an
invisible
sun
.
All
these
things
and
,
still
more
than
these
,
*NL*
the
treasures
which
had
come
to
the
church
from
personages
who
to
me
*NL*
were
almost
legendary
figures
-LRB-
such
as
the
golden
cross
wrought
,
it
was
*NL*
said
,
by
Saint
Eloi
and
presented
by
Dagobert
,
and
the
tomb
of
the
sons
*NL*
of
Louis
the
Germanic
in
porphyry
and
enamelled
copper
-RRB-
,
because
of
*NL*
which
I
used
to
go
forward
into
the
church
when
we
were
making
our
way
*NL*
to
our
chairs
as
into
a
fairy-haunted
valley
,
where
the
rustic
sees
with
*NL*
amazement
on
a
rock
,
a
tree
,
a
marsh
,
the
tangible
proofs
of
the
little
*NL*
people
's
supernatural
passage
--
all
these
things
made
of
the
church
for
*NL*
me
something
entirely
different
from
the
rest
of
the
town
;
a
building
*NL*
which
occupied
,
so
to
speak
,
four
dimensions
of
space
--
the
name
of
the
*NL*
fourth
being
Time
--
which
had
sailed
the
centuries
with
that
old
nave
,
*NL*
where
bay
after
bay
,
chapel
after
chapel
,
seemed
to
stretch
across
*NL*
and
hold
down
and
conquer
not
merely
a
few
yards
of
soil
,
but
each
*NL*
successive
epoch
from
which
the
whole
building
had
emerged
triumphant
,
*NL*
hiding
the
rugged
barbarities
of
the
eleventh
century
in
the
thickness
*NL*
of
its
walls
,
through
which
nothing
could
be
seen
of
the
heavy
arches
,
*NL*
long
stopped
and
blinded
with
coarse
blocks
of
ashlar
,
except
where
,
*NL*
near
the
porch
,
a
deep
groove
was
furrowed
into
one
wall
by
the
*NL*
tower-stair
;
and
even
there
the
barbarity
was
veiled
by
the
graceful
*NL*
gothic
arcade
which
pressed
coquettishly
upon
it
,
like
a
row
of
grown-up
*NL*
sisters
who
,
to
hide
him
from
the
eyes
of
strangers
,
arrange
themselves
*NL*
smilingly
in
front
of
a
countrified
,
unmannerly
and
ill-dressed
younger
*NL*
brother
;
rearing
into
the
sky
above
the
Square
a
tower
which
had
looked
*NL*
down
upon
Saint
Louis
,
and
seemed
to
behold
him
still
;
and
thrusting
*NL*
down
with
its
crypt
into
the
blackness
of
a
Merovingian
night
,
through
*NL*
which
,
guiding
us
with
groping
finger-tips
beneath
the
shadowy
vault
,
*NL*
ribbed
strongly
as
an
immense
bat
's
wing
of
stone
,
Théodore
or
his
*NL*
sister
would
light
up
for
us
with
a
candle
the
tomb
of
Sigebert
's
little
*NL*
daughter
,
in
which
a
deep
hole
,
like
the
bed
of
a
fossil
,
had
been
*NL*
bored
,
or
so
it
was
said
,
``
by
a
crystal
lamp
which
,
on
the
night
when
*NL*
the
Frankish
princess
was
murdered
,
had
left
,
of
its
own
accord
,
the
*NL*
golden
chains
by
which
it
was
suspended
where
the
apse
is
to-day
and
*NL*
with
neither
the
crystal
broken
nor
the
light
extinguished
had
buried
*NL*
itself
in
the
stone
,
through
which
it
had
gently
forced
its
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
apse
of
Combray
:
what
am
I
to
say
of
that
?
It
was
so
*NL*
coarse
,
so
devoid
of
artistic
beauty
,
even
of
the
religious
spirit
.
From
*NL*
outside
,
since
the
street
crossing
which
it
commanded
was
on
a
lower
*NL*
level
,
its
great
wall
was
thrust
upwards
from
a
basement
of
unfaced
*NL*
ashlar
,
jagged
with
flints
,
in
all
of
which
there
was
nothing
*NL*
particularly
ecclesiastical
;
the
windows
seemed
to
have
been
pierced
at
*NL*
an
abnormal
height
,
and
its
whole
appearance
was
that
of
a
prison
wall
*NL*
rather
than
of
a
church
.
And
certainly
in
later
years
,
were
I
to
recall
*NL*
all
the
glorious
apses
that
I
had
seen
,
it
would
never
enter
my
mind
to
*NL*
compare
with
any
one
of
them
the
apse
of
Combray
.
Only
,
one
day
,
*NL*
turning
out
of
a
little
street
in
some
country
town
,
I
came
upon
three
*NL*
alley-ways
that
converged
,
and
facing
them
an
old
wall
,
rubbed
,
worn
,
*NL*
crumbling
,
and
unusually
high
;
with
windows
pierced
in
it
far
overhead
*NL*
and
the
same
asymmetrical
appearance
as
the
apse
of
Combray
.
And
at
that
*NL*
moment
I
did
not
say
to
myself
,
as
at
Chartres
I
might
have
done
or
at
*NL*
Rheims
,
with
what
strength
the
religious
feeling
had
been
expressed
in
*NL*
its
construction
,
but
instinctively
I
exclaimed
``
The
Church
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
church
!
A
dear
,
familiar
friend
;
close
pressed
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Hilaire
,
upon
which
its
north
door
opened
,
by
its
two
neighbours
,
*NL*
Mme.
Loiseau
's
house
and
the
pharmacy
of
M.
Rapin
,
against
which
its
*NL*
walls
rested
without
interspace
;
a
simple
citizen
of
Combray
,
who
might
*NL*
have
had
her
number
in
the
street
had
the
streets
of
Combray
borne
*NL*
numbers
,
and
at
whose
door
one
felt
that
the
postman
ought
to
stop
on
*NL*
his
morning
rounds
,
before
going
into
Mme.
Loiseau
's
and
after
leaving
*NL*
M.
Rapin
's
,
there
existed
,
for
all
that
,
between
the
church
and
*NL*
everything
in
Combray
that
was
not
the
church
a
clear
line
of
*NL*
demarcation
which
I
have
never
succeeded
in
eliminating
from
my
mind
.
*NL*
In
vain
might
Mme.
Loiseau
deck
her
window-sills
with
fuchsias
,
which
*NL*
developed
the
bad
habit
of
letting
their
branches
trail
at
all
times
*NL*
and
in
all
directions
,
head
downwards
,
and
whose
flowers
had
no
more
*NL*
important
business
,
when
they
were
big
enough
to
taste
the
joys
of
life
,
*NL*
than
to
go
and
cool
their
purple
,
congested
cheeks
against
the
dark
*NL*
front
of
the
church
;
to
me
such
conduct
sanctified
the
fuchsias
not
at
*NL*
all
;
between
the
flowers
and
the
blackened
stones
towards
which
they
*NL*
leaned
,
if
my
eyes
could
discern
no
interval
,
my
mind
preserved
the
*NL*
impression
of
an
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
long
way
off
one
could
distinguish
and
identify
the
steeple
of
*NL*
Saint-Hilaire
inscribing
its
unforgettable
form
upon
a
horizon
beneath
*NL*
which
Combray
had
not
yet
appeared
;
when
from
the
train
which
brought
*NL*
us
down
from
Paris
at
Easter-time
my
father
caught
sight
of
it
,
as
it
*NL*
slipped
into
every
fold
of
the
sky
in
turn
,
its
little
iron
cock
veering
*NL*
continually
in
all
directions
,
he
would
say
:
``
Come
,
get
your
wraps
*NL*
together
,
we
are
there
.
''
And
on
one
of
the
longest
walks
we
ever
took
*NL*
from
Combray
there
was
a
spot
where
the
narrow
road
emerged
suddenly
*NL*
on
to
an
immense
plain
,
closed
at
the
horizon
by
strips
of
forest
over
*NL*
which
rose
and
stood
alone
the
fine
point
of
Saint-Hilaire
's
steeple
,
*NL*
but
so
sharpened
and
so
pink
that
it
seemed
to
be
no
more
than
sketched
*NL*
on
the
sky
by
the
finger-nail
of
a
painter
anxious
to
give
to
such
a
*NL*
landscape
,
to
so
pure
a
piece
of
`
nature
,
'
this
little
sign
of
art
,
this
*NL*
single
indication
of
human
existence
.
As
one
drew
near
it
and
could
make
*NL*
out
the
remains
of
the
square
tower
,
half
in
ruins
,
which
still
stood
by
*NL*
its
side
,
though
without
rivalling
it
in
height
,
one
was
struck
,
first
*NL*
of
all
,
by
the
tone
,
reddish
and
sombre
,
of
its
stones
;
and
on
a
misty
*NL*
morning
in
autumn
one
would
have
called
it
,
to
see
it
rising
above
the
*NL*
violet
thunder-cloud
of
the
vineyards
,
a
ruin
of
purple
,
almost
the
*NL*
colour
of
the
wild
vine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
in
the
Square
,
as
we
came
home
,
my
grandmother
would
make
me
stop
*NL*
to
look
up
at
it
.
From
the
tower
windows
,
placed
two
and
two
,
one
pair
*NL*
above
another
,
with
that
right
and
original
proportion
in
their
spacing
*NL*
to
which
not
only
human
faces
owe
their
beauty
and
dignity
,
it
released
,
*NL*
it
let
fall
at
regular
intervals
flights
of
jackdaws
which
for
a
little
*NL*
while
would
wheel
and
caw
,
as
though
the
ancient
stones
which
allowed
*NL*
them
to
sport
thus
and
never
seemed
to
see
them
,
becoming
of
a
sudden
*NL*
uninhabitable
and
discharging
some
infinitely
disturbing
element
,
had
*NL*
struck
them
and
driven
them
forth
.
Then
after
patterning
everywhere
the
*NL*
violet
velvet
of
the
evening
air
,
abruptly
soothed
,
they
would
return
*NL*
and
be
absorbed
in
the
tower
,
deadly
no
longer
but
benignant
,
some
*NL*
perching
here
and
there
-LRB-
not
seeming
to
move
,
but
snapping
,
perhaps
,
and
*NL*
swallowing
some
passing
insect
-RRB-
on
the
points
of
turrets
,
as
a
seagull
*NL*
perches
,
with
an
angler
's
immobility
,
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
.
Without
*NL*
quite
knowing
why
,
my
grandmother
found
in
the
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
*NL*
that
absence
of
vulgarity
,
pretension
,
and
meanness
which
made
her
*NL*
love
--
and
deem
rich
in
beneficent
influences
--
nature
itself
,
when
the
*NL*
hand
of
man
had
not
,
as
did
my
great-aunt
's
gardener
,
trimmed
it
,
and
*NL*
the
works
of
genius
.
And
certainly
every
part
one
saw
of
the
church
*NL*
served
to
distinguish
the
whole
from
any
other
building
by
a
kind
of
*NL*
general
feeling
which
pervaded
it
,
but
it
was
in
the
steeple
that
*NL*
the
church
seemed
to
display
a
consciousness
of
itself
,
to
affirm
its
*NL*
individual
and
responsible
existence
.
It
was
the
steeple
which
spoke
for
*NL*
the
church
.
I
think
,
too
,
that
in
a
confused
way
my
grandmother
found
in
*NL*
the
steeple
of
Combray
what
she
prized
above
anything
else
in
the
*NL*
world
,
namely
,
a
natural
air
and
an
air
of
distinction
.
Ignorant
of
*NL*
architecture
,
she
would
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dears
,
laugh
at
me
if
you
like
;
it
is
not
conventionally
beautiful
,
*NL*
but
there
is
something
in
its
quaint
old
face
which
pleases
me
.
If
it
*NL*
could
play
the
piano
,
I
am
sure
it
would
really
_
play
_
.
''
And
when
she
*NL*
gazed
on
it
,
when
her
eyes
followed
the
gentle
tension
,
the
fervent
*NL*
inclination
of
its
stony
slopes
which
drew
together
as
they
rose
,
like
*NL*
hands
joined
in
prayer
,
she
would
absorb
herself
so
utterly
in
the
*NL*
outpouring
of
the
spire
that
her
gaze
seemed
to
leap
upwards
with
it
;
*NL*
her
lips
at
the
same
time
curving
in
a
friendly
smile
for
the
worn
old
*NL*
stones
of
which
the
setting
sun
now
illumined
no
more
than
the
topmost
*NL*
pinnacles
,
which
,
at
the
point
where
they
entered
that
zone
of
sunlight
*NL*
and
were
softened
and
sweetened
by
it
,
seemed
to
have
mounted
suddenly
*NL*
far
higher
,
to
have
become
truly
remote
,
like
a
song
whose
singer
breaks
*NL*
into
falsetto
,
an
octave
above
the
accompanying
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
which
shaped
and
crowned
and
*NL*
consecrated
every
occupation
,
every
hour
of
the
day
,
every
point
of
view
*NL*
in
the
town
.
From
my
bedroom
window
I
could
discern
no
more
than
its
*NL*
base
,
which
had
been
freshly
covered
with
slates
;
but
when
on
Sundays
I
*NL*
saw
these
,
in
the
hot
light
of
a
summer
morning
,
blaze
like
a
black
sun
*NL*
I
would
say
to
myself
:
``
Good
heavens
!
nine
o'clock
!
I
must
get
ready
for
*NL*
mass
at
once
if
I
am
to
have
time
to
go
in
and
kiss
aunt
Léonie
first
,
''
*NL*
and
I
would
know
exactly
what
was
the
colour
of
the
sunlight
upon
the
*NL*
Square
,
I
could
feel
the
heat
and
dust
of
the
market
,
the
shade
behind
*NL*
the
blinds
of
the
shop
into
which
Mamma
would
perhaps
go
on
her
way
*NL*
to
mass
,
penetrating
its
odour
of
unbleached
calico
,
to
purchase
a
*NL*
handkerchief
or
something
,
of
which
the
draper
himself
would
let
her
see
*NL*
what
he
had
,
bowing
from
the
waist
:
who
,
having
made
everything
ready
*NL*
for
shutting
up
,
had
just
gone
into
the
back
shop
to
put
on
his
Sunday
*NL*
coat
and
to
wash
his
hands
,
which
it
was
his
habit
,
every
few
minutes
*NL*
and
even
on
the
saddest
occasions
,
to
rub
one
against
the
other
with
an
*NL*
air
of
enterprise
,
cunning
,
and
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
,
after
mass
,
when
we
looked
in
to
tell
Théodore
to
bring
a
*NL*
larger
loaf
than
usual
because
our
cousins
had
taken
advantage
of
the
*NL*
fine
weather
to
come
over
from
Thiberzy
for
luncheon
,
we
had
in
front
of
*NL*
us
the
steeple
,
which
,
baked
and
brown
itself
like
a
larger
loaf
still
*NL*
of
`
holy
bread
,
'
with
flakes
and
sticky
drops
on
it
of
sunlight
,
pricked
*NL*
its
sharp
point
into
the
blue
sky
.
And
in
the
evening
,
as
I
came
in
from
*NL*
my
walk
and
thought
of
the
approaching
moment
when
I
must
say
good
night
*NL*
to
my
mother
and
see
her
no
more
,
the
steeple
was
by
contrast
so
kindly
,
*NL*
there
at
the
close
of
day
,
that
I
would
imagine
it
as
being
laid
,
like
a
*NL*
brown
velvet
cushion
,
against
--
as
being
thrust
into
the
pallid
sky
which
*NL*
had
yielded
beneath
its
pressure
,
had
sunk
slightly
so
as
to
make
room
*NL*
for
it
,
and
had
correspondingly
risen
on
either
side
;
while
the
cries
of
*NL*
the
birds
wheeling
to
and
fro
about
it
seemed
to
intensify
its
silence
,
*NL*
to
elongate
its
spire
still
further
,
and
to
invest
it
with
some
quality
*NL*
beyond
the
power
of
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
when
our
errands
lay
in
places
behind
the
church
,
from
which
it
*NL*
could
not
be
seen
,
the
view
seemed
always
to
have
been
composed
with
*NL*
reference
to
the
steeple
,
which
would
stand
up
,
now
here
,
now
there
,
*NL*
among
the
houses
,
and
was
perhaps
even
more
affecting
when
it
appeared
*NL*
thus
without
the
church
.
And
,
indeed
,
there
are
many
others
which
*NL*
look
best
when
seen
in
this
way
,
and
I
can
call
to
mind
vignettes
of
*NL*
housetops
with
surmounting
steeples
in
quite
another
category
of
art
*NL*
than
those
formed
by
the
dreary
streets
of
Combray
.
I
shall
never
*NL*
forget
,
in
a
quaint
Norman
town
not
far
from
Balbec
,
two
charming
*NL*
eighteenth-century
houses
,
dear
to
me
and
venerable
for
many
reasons
,
*NL*
between
which
,
when
one
looks
up
at
them
from
a
fine
garden
which
*NL*
descends
in
terraces
to
the
river
,
the
gothic
spire
of
a
church
-LRB-
itself
*NL*
hidden
by
the
houses
-RRB-
soars
into
the
sky
with
the
effect
of
crowning
and
*NL*
completing
their
fronts
,
but
in
a
material
so
different
,
so
precious
,
so
*NL*
beringed
,
so
rosy
,
so
polished
,
that
it
is
at
once
seen
to
be
no
more
*NL*
a
part
of
them
than
would
be
a
part
of
two
pretty
pebbles
lying
side
*NL*
by
side
,
between
which
it
had
been
washed
on
the
beach
,
the
purple
,
*NL*
crinkled
spire
of
some
sea-shell
spun
out
into
a
turret
and
gay
with
*NL*
glossy
colour
.
Even
in
Paris
,
in
one
of
the
ugliest
parts
of
the
town
,
I
*NL*
know
a
window
from
which
one
can
see
across
a
first
,
a
second
,
and
even
*NL*
a
third
layer
of
jumbled
roofs
,
street
beyond
street
,
a
violet
bell
,
*NL*
sometimes
ruddy
,
sometimes
too
,
in
the
finest
`
prints
'
which
the
*NL*
atmosphere
makes
of
it
,
of
an
ashy
solution
of
black
;
which
is
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
nothing
else
than
the
dome
of
Saint-Augustin
,
and
which
imparts
to
this
*NL*
view
of
Paris
the
character
of
some
of
the
Piranesi
views
of
Rome
.
But
*NL*
since
into
none
of
these
little
etchings
,
whatever
the
taste
my
*NL*
memory
may
have
been
able
to
bring
to
their
execution
,
was
it
able
to
*NL*
contribute
an
element
I
have
long
lost
,
the
feeling
which
makes
us
not
*NL*
merely
regard
a
thing
as
a
spectacle
,
but
believe
in
it
as
in
a
creature
*NL*
without
parallel
,
so
none
of
them
keeps
in
dependence
on
it
a
whole
*NL*
section
of
my
inmost
life
as
does
the
memory
of
those
aspects
of
the
*NL*
steeple
of
Combray
from
the
streets
behind
the
church
.
Whether
one
saw
*NL*
it
at
five
o'clock
when
going
to
call
for
letters
at
the
post-office
,
*NL*
some
doors
away
from
one
,
on
the
left
,
raising
abruptly
with
its
*NL*
isolated
peak
the
ridge
of
housetops
;
or
again
,
when
one
had
to
go
in
*NL*
and
ask
for
news
of
Mme.
Sazerat
,
one
's
eyes
followed
the
line
where
it
*NL*
ran
low
again
beyond
the
farther
,
descending
slope
,
and
one
knew
that
it
*NL*
would
be
the
second
turning
after
the
steeple
;
or
yet
again
,
if
pressing
*NL*
further
afield
one
went
to
the
station
,
one
saw
it
obliquely
,
shewing
in
*NL*
profile
fresh
angles
and
surfaces
,
like
a
solid
body
surprised
at
some
*NL*
unknown
point
in
its
revolution
;
or
,
from
the
banks
of
the
Vivonne
,
the
*NL*
apse
,
drawn
muscularly
together
and
heightened
in
perspective
,
seemed
*NL*
to
spring
upwards
with
the
effort
which
the
steeple
made
to
hurl
its
*NL*
spire-point
into
the
heart
of
heaven
:
it
was
always
to
the
steeple
that
*NL*
one
must
return
,
always
it
which
dominated
everything
else
,
summing
up
*NL*
the
houses
with
an
unexpected
pinnacle
,
raised
before
me
like
the
Finger
*NL*
of
God
,
Whose
Body
might
have
been
concealed
below
among
the
crowd
of
*NL*
human
bodies
without
fear
of
my
confounding
It
,
for
that
reason
,
with
*NL*
them
.
And
so
even
to-day
in
any
large
provincial
town
,
or
in
a
quarter
*NL*
of
Paris
which
I
do
not
know
well
,
if
a
passer-by
who
is
`
putting
me
on
*NL*
the
right
road
'
shews
me
from
afar
,
as
a
point
to
aim
at
,
some
belfry
of
*NL*
a
hospital
,
or
a
convent
steeple
lifting
the
peak
of
its
ecclesiastical
*NL*
cap
at
the
corner
of
the
street
which
I
am
to
take
,
my
memory
need
only
*NL*
find
in
it
some
dim
resemblance
to
that
dear
and
vanished
outline
,
and
*NL*
the
passer-by
,
should
he
turn
round
to
make
sure
that
I
have
not
gone
*NL*
astray
,
would
see
me
,
to
his
astonishment
,
oblivious
of
the
walk
that
I
*NL*
had
planned
to
take
or
the
place
where
I
was
obliged
to
call
,
standing
*NL*
still
on
the
spot
,
before
that
steeple
,
for
hours
on
end
,
motionless
,
*NL*
trying
to
remember
,
feeling
deep
within
myself
a
tract
of
soil
reclaimed
*NL*
from
the
waters
of
Lethe
slowly
drying
until
the
buildings
rise
on
it
*NL*
again
;
and
then
no
doubt
,
and
then
more
uneasily
than
when
,
just
now
,
*NL*
I
asked
him
for
a
direction
,
I
will
seek
my
way
again
,
I
will
turn
a
*NL*
corner
...
but
...
the
goal
is
in
my
heart
...
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
way
home
from
mass
we
would
often
meet
M.
Legrandin
,
who
,
*NL*
detained
in
Paris
by
his
professional
duties
as
an
engineer
,
could
*NL*
only
-LRB-
except
in
the
regular
holiday
seasons
-RRB-
visit
his
home
at
Combray
*NL*
between
Saturday
evenings
and
Monday
mornings
.
He
was
one
of
that
class
*NL*
of
men
who
,
apart
from
a
scientific
career
in
which
they
may
well
have
*NL*
proved
brilliantly
successful
,
have
acquired
an
entirely
different
*NL*
kind
of
culture
,
literary
or
artistic
,
of
which
they
make
no
use
in
the
*NL*
specialised
work
of
their
profession
,
but
by
which
their
conversation
*NL*
profits
.
More
`
literary
'
than
many
`
men
of
letters
'
-LRB-
we
were
not
aware
*NL*
at
this
period
that
M.
Legrandin
had
a
distinct
reputation
as
a
writer
,
*NL*
and
so
were
greatly
astonished
to
find
that
a
well-known
composer
*NL*
had
set
some
verses
of
his
to
music
-RRB-
,
endowed
with
a
greater
ease
*NL*
in
execution
than
many
painters
,
they
imagine
that
the
life
they
are
*NL*
obliged
to
lead
is
not
that
for
which
they
are
really
fitted
,
and
they
*NL*
bring
to
their
regular
occupations
either
a
fantastic
indifference
or
*NL*
a
sustained
and
lofty
application
,
scornful
,
bitter
,
and
conscientious
.
*NL*
Tall
,
with
a
good
figure
,
a
fine
,
thoughtful
face
,
drooping
fair
*NL*
moustaches
,
a
look
of
disillusionment
in
his
blue
eyes
,
an
almost
*NL*
exaggerated
refinement
of
courtesy
;
a
talker
such
as
we
had
never
heard
;
*NL*
he
was
in
the
sight
of
my
family
,
who
never
ceased
to
quote
him
as
an
*NL*
example
,
the
very
pattern
of
a
gentleman
,
who
took
life
in
the
noblest
*NL*
and
most
delicate
manner
.
My
grandmother
alone
found
fault
with
him
for
*NL*
speaking
a
little
too
well
,
a
little
too
much
like
a
book
,
for
not
using
*NL*
a
vocabulary
as
natural
as
his
loosely
knotted
Lavallière
neckties
,
his
*NL*
short
,
straight
,
almost
schoolboyish
coat
.
She
was
astonished
,
too
,
at
*NL*
the
furious
invective
which
he
was
always
launching
at
the
aristocracy
,
*NL*
at
fashionable
life
,
and
`
snobbishness
'
--
``
undoubtedly
,
''
he
would
say
,
*NL*
``
the
sin
of
which
Saint
Paul
is
thinking
when
he
speaks
of
the
sin
for
*NL*
which
there
is
no
forgiveness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Worldly
ambition
was
a
thing
which
my
grandmother
was
so
little
capable
*NL*
of
feeling
,
or
indeed
of
understanding
,
that
it
seemed
to
her
futile
to
*NL*
apply
so
much
heat
to
its
condemnation
.
Besides
,
she
thought
it
in
not
*NL*
very
good
taste
that
M.
Legrandin
,
whose
sister
was
married
to
a
country
*NL*
gentleman
of
Lower
Normandy
near
Balbec
,
should
deliver
himself
of
such
*NL*
violent
attacks
upon
the
nobles
,
going
so
far
as
to
blame
the
Revolution
*NL*
for
not
having
guillotined
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
met
,
my
friends
!
''
he
would
say
as
he
came
towards
us
.
``
You
are
*NL*
lucky
to
spend
so
much
time
here
;
to-morrow
I
have
to
go
back
to
Paris
,
*NL*
to
squeeze
back
into
my
niche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
admit
,
''
he
went
on
,
with
his
own
peculiar
smile
,
gently
ironical
,
*NL*
disillusioned
and
vague
,
``
I
have
every
useless
thing
in
the
world
in
*NL*
my
house
there
.
The
only
thing
wanting
is
the
necessary
thing
,
a
great
*NL*
patch
of
open
sky
like
this
.
Always
try
to
keep
a
patch
of
sky
above
*NL*
your
life
,
little
boy
,
''
he
added
,
turning
to
me
.
``
You
have
a
soul
in
*NL*
you
of
rare
quality
,
an
artist
's
nature
;
never
let
it
starve
for
lack
of
*NL*
what
it
needs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
on
our
reaching
the
house
,
my
aunt
would
send
to
ask
us
whether
*NL*
Mme.
Goupil
had
indeed
arrived
late
for
mass
,
not
one
of
us
could
inform
*NL*
her
.
Instead
,
we
increased
her
anxiety
by
telling
her
that
there
was
*NL*
a
painter
at
work
in
the
church
copying
the
window
of
Gilbert
the
*NL*
Bad
.
Françoise
was
at
once
dispatched
to
the
grocer
's
,
but
returned
*NL*
empty-handed
owing
to
the
absence
of
Théodore
,
whose
dual
profession
of
*NL*
choirman
,
with
a
part
in
the
maintenance
of
the
fabric
,
and
of
grocer
's
*NL*
assistant
gave
him
not
only
relations
with
all
sections
of
society
,
but
*NL*
an
encyclopaedic
knowledge
of
their
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
my
aunt
would
sigh
,
``
I
wish
it
were
time
for
Eulalie
to
come
.
She
*NL*
is
really
the
only
person
who
will
be
able
to
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eulalie
was
a
limping
,
energetic
,
deaf
spinster
who
had
`
retired
'
after
*NL*
the
death
of
Mme.
de
la
Bretonnerie
,
with
whom
she
had
been
in
service
*NL*
from
her
childhood
,
and
had
then
taken
a
room
beside
the
church
,
from
*NL*
which
she
would
incessantly
emerge
,
either
to
attend
some
service
,
*NL*
or
,
when
there
was
no
service
,
to
say
a
prayer
by
herself
or
to
give
*NL*
Théodore
a
hand
;
the
rest
of
her
time
she
spent
in
visiting
sick
persons
*NL*
like
my
aunt
Léonie
,
to
whom
she
would
relate
everything
that
had
*NL*
occurred
at
mass
or
vespers
.
She
was
not
above
adding
occasional
*NL*
pocket-money
to
the
little
income
which
was
found
for
her
by
the
family
*NL*
of
her
old
employers
by
going
from
time
to
time
to
look
after
the
Curé
's
*NL*
linen
,
or
that
of
some
other
person
of
note
in
the
clerical
world
of
*NL*
Combray
.
Above
a
mantle
of
black
cloth
she
wore
a
little
white
coif
that
*NL*
seemed
almost
to
attach
her
to
some
Order
,
and
an
infirmity
of
the
*NL*
skin
had
stained
part
of
her
cheeks
and
her
crooked
nose
the
bright
red
*NL*
colour
of
balsam
.
Her
visits
were
the
one
great
distraction
in
the
life
*NL*
of
my
aunt
Léonie
,
who
now
saw
hardly
anyone
else
,
except
the
reverend
*NL*
Curé
.
My
aunt
had
by
degrees
erased
every
other
visitor
's
name
from
*NL*
her
list
,
because
they
all
committed
the
fatal
error
,
in
her
eyes
,
*NL*
of
falling
into
one
or
other
of
the
two
categories
of
people
she
most
*NL*
detested
.
One
group
,
the
worse
of
the
two
,
and
the
one
of
which
she
rid
*NL*
herself
first
,
consisted
of
those
who
advised
her
not
to
take
so
much
*NL*
care
of
herself
,
and
preached
-LRB-
even
if
only
negatively
and
with
no
*NL*
outward
signs
beyond
an
occasional
disapproving
silence
or
doubting
*NL*
smile
-RRB-
the
subversive
doctrine
that
a
sharp
walk
in
the
sun
and
a
good
*NL*
red
beefsteak
would
do
her
more
good
-LRB-
her
,
who
had
had
two
dreadful
sips
*NL*
of
Vichy
water
on
her
stomach
for
fourteen
hours
!
-RRB-
than
all
her
medicine
*NL*
bottles
and
her
bed
.
The
other
category
was
composed
of
people
who
*NL*
appeared
to
believe
that
she
was
more
seriously
ill
than
she
thought
,
*NL*
in
fact
that
she
was
as
seriously
ill
as
she
said
.
And
so
none
of
those
*NL*
whom
she
had
allowed
upstairs
to
her
room
,
after
considerable
hesitation
*NL*
and
at
Françoise
urgent
request
,
and
who
in
the
course
of
their
visit
*NL*
had
shewn
how
unworthy
they
were
of
the
honour
which
had
been
done
them
*NL*
by
venturing
a
timid
:
``
Do
n't
you
think
that
if
you
were
just
to
stir
out
*NL*
a
little
on
really
fine
days
...
?
''
or
who
,
on
the
other
hand
,
when
she
*NL*
said
to
them
:
``
I
am
very
low
,
very
low
;
nearing
the
end
,
dear
friends
!
''
*NL*
had
replied
:
``
Ah
,
yes
,
when
one
has
no
strength
left
!
Still
,
you
may
*NL*
last
a
while
yet
''
;
each
party
alike
might
be
certain
that
her
doors
*NL*
would
never
open
to
them
again
.
And
if
Françoise
was
amused
by
the
look
*NL*
of
consternation
on
my
aunt
's
face
whenever
she
saw
,
from
her
bed
,
any
*NL*
of
these
people
in
the
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
,
who
looked
as
if
they
were
*NL*
coming
to
see
her
,
or
heard
her
own
door-bell
ring
,
she
would
laugh
far
*NL*
more
heartily
,
as
at
a
clever
trick
,
at
my
aunt
's
devices
-LRB-
which
never
*NL*
failed
-RRB-
for
having
them
sent
away
,
and
at
their
look
of
discomfiture
*NL*
when
they
had
to
turn
back
without
having
seen
her
;
and
would
be
filled
*NL*
with
secret
admiration
for
her
mistress
,
whom
she
felt
to
be
superior
*NL*
to
all
these
other
people
,
inasmuch
as
she
could
and
did
contrive
not
to
*NL*
see
them
.
In
short
,
my
aunt
stipulated
,
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
that
*NL*
whoever
came
to
see
her
must
approve
of
her
way
of
life
,
commiserate
*NL*
with
her
in
her
sufferings
,
and
assure
her
of
an
ultimate
recovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
this
Eulalie
excelled
.
My
aunt
might
say
to
her
twenty
times
in
*NL*
a
minute
:
``
The
end
is
come
at
last
,
my
poor
Eulalie
!
''
,
twenty
times
*NL*
Eulalie
would
retort
with
:
``
Knowing
your
illness
as
you
do
,
Mme.
*NL*
Octave
,
you
will
live
to
be
a
hundred
,
as
Mme.
Sazerin
said
to
me
only
*NL*
yesterday
.
''
For
one
of
Eulalie
's
most
rooted
beliefs
,
and
one
that
the
*NL*
formidable
list
of
corrections
which
her
experience
must
have
compiled
*NL*
was
powerless
to
eradicate
,
was
that
Mme.
Sazerat
's
name
was
really
Mme.
*NL*
Sazerin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
ask
to
live
to
a
hundred
,
''
my
aunt
would
say
,
for
she
*NL*
preferred
to
have
no
definite
limit
fixed
to
the
number
of
her
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
since
,
besides
this
,
Eulalie
knew
,
as
no
one
else
knew
,
how
to
*NL*
distract
my
aunt
without
tiring
her
,
her
visits
,
which
took
place
*NL*
regularly
every
Sunday
,
unless
something
unforeseen
occurred
to
prevent
*NL*
them
,
were
for
my
aunt
a
pleasure
the
prospect
of
which
kept
her
on
*NL*
those
days
in
a
state
of
expectation
,
appetising
enough
to
begin
with
,
*NL*
but
at
once
changing
to
the
agony
of
a
hunger
too
long
unsatisfied
if
*NL*
Eulalie
were
a
minute
late
in
coming
.
For
,
if
unduly
prolonged
,
the
*NL*
rapture
of
waiting
for
Eulalie
became
a
torture
,
and
my
aunt
would
never
*NL*
cease
from
looking
at
the
time
,
and
yawning
,
and
complaining
of
each
of
*NL*
her
symptoms
in
turn
.
Eulalie
's
ring
,
if
it
sounded
from
the
front
door
*NL*
at
the
very
end
of
the
day
,
when
she
was
no
longer
expecting
it
,
would
*NL*
almost
make
her
ill
.
For
the
fact
was
that
on
Sundays
she
thought
of
*NL*
nothing
else
than
this
visit
,
and
the
moment
that
our
luncheon
was
ended
*NL*
Françoise
would
become
impatient
for
us
to
leave
the
dining-room
so
that
*NL*
she
might
go
upstairs
to
`
occupy
'
my
aunt
.
But
--
and
this
more
than
ever
*NL*
from
the
day
on
which
fine
weather
definitely
set
in
at
Combray
--
the
*NL*
proud
hour
°
f
noon
,
descending
from
the
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
which
*NL*
it
blazoned
for
a
moment
with
the
twelve
points
of
its
sonorous
crown
,
*NL*
would
long
have
echoed
about
our
table
,
beside
the
`
holy
bread
,
'
which
*NL*
too
had
come
in
,
after
church
,
in
its
familiar
way
;
and
we
would
still
*NL*
be
found
seated
in
front
of
our
Arabian
Nights
plates
,
weighed
down
*NL*
by
the
heat
of
the
day
,
and
even
more
by
our
heavy
meal
.
For
upon
*NL*
the
permanent
foundation
of
eggs
,
cutlets
,
potatoes
,
preserves
,
and
*NL*
biscuits
,
whose
appearance
on
the
table
she
no
longer
announced
to
us
,
*NL*
Françoise
would
add
--
as
the
labour
of
fields
and
orchards
,
the
harvest
*NL*
of
the
tides
,
the
luck
of
the
markets
,
the
kindness
of
neighbours
,
and
*NL*
her
own
genius
might
provide
;
and
so
effectively
that
our
bill
of
fare
,
*NL*
like
the
quatrefoils
that
were
carved
on
the
porches
of
cathedrals
*NL*
in
the
thirteenth
century
,
reflected
to
some
extent
the
march
of
the
*NL*
seasons
and
the
incidents
of
human
life
--
a
brill
,
because
the
fish-woman
*NL*
had
guaranteed
its
freshness
;
a
turkey
,
because
she
had
seen
a
beauty
*NL*
in
the
market
at
Roussainville-le-Pin
;
cardoons
with
marrow
,
because
she
*NL*
had
never
done
them
for
us
in
that
way
before
;
a
roast
leg
of
mutton
,
*NL*
because
the
fresh
air
made
one
hungry
and
there
would
be
plenty
of
time
*NL*
for
it
to
`
settle
down
'
in
the
seven
hours
before
dinner
;
spinach
,
*NL*
by
way
of
a
change
;
apricots
,
because
they
were
still
hard
to
get
;
*NL*
gooseberries
,
because
in
another
fortnight
there
would
be
none
left
;
*NL*
raspberries
,
which
M.
Swann
had
brought
specially
;
cherries
,
the
first
*NL*
to
come
from
the
cherry-tree
,
which
had
yielded
none
for
the
last
two
*NL*
years
;
a
cream
cheese
,
of
which
in
those
days
I
was
extremely
fond
;
an
*NL*
almond
cake
,
because
she
had
ordered
one
the
evening
before
;
a
fancy
*NL*
loaf
,
because
it
was
our
turn
to
`
offer
'
the
holy
bread
.
And
when
all
*NL*
these
had
been
eaten
,
a
work
composed
expressly
for
ourselves
,
but
*NL*
dedicated
more
particularly
to
my
father
,
who
had
a
fondness
for
such
*NL*
things
,
a
cream
of
chocolate
,
inspired
in
the
mind
,
created
by
the
*NL*
hand
of
Françoise
,
would
be
laid
before
us
,
light
and
fleeting
as
an
*NL*
`
occasional
piece
'
of
music
,
into
which
she
had
poured
the
whole
of
her
*NL*
talent
.
Anyone
who
refused
to
partake
of
it
,
saying
:
``
No
,
thank
you
,
I
*NL*
have
finished
;
I
am
not
hungry
,
''
would
at
once
have
been
lowered
to
the
*NL*
level
of
the
Philistines
who
,
when
an
artist
makes
them
a
present
of
one
*NL*
of
his
works
,
examine
its
weight
and
material
,
whereas
what
is
of
value
*NL*
is
the
creator
's
intention
and
his
signature
.
To
have
left
even
the
*NL*
tiniest
morsel
in
the
dish
would
have
shewn
as
much
discourtesy
as
to
*NL*
rise
and
leave
a
concert
hall
while
the
`
piece
'
was
still
being
played
,
*NL*
and
under
the
composer
's
-
very
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
my
mother
would
say
to
me
:
``
Now
,
do
n't
stay
here
all
day
;
*NL*
you
can
go
up
to
your
room
if
you
are
too
hot
outside
,
but
get
a
little
*NL*
fresh
air
first
;
do
n't
start
reading
immediately
after
your
food
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
would
go
and
sit
down
beside
the
pump
and
its
trough
,
ornamented
*NL*
here
and
there
,
like
a
gothic
font
,
with
a
salamander
,
which
modelled
*NL*
upon
a
background
of
crumbling
stone
the
quick
relief
of
its
slender
,
*NL*
allegorical
body
;
on
the
bench
without
a
back
,
in
the
shade
of
a
*NL*
lilac-tree
,
in
that
little
corner
of
the
garden
which
communicated
,
by
*NL*
a
service
door
,
with
the
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
,
and
from
whose
neglected
*NL*
soil
rose
,
in
two
stages
,
an
outcrop
from
the
house
itself
and
*NL*
apparently
a
separate
building
,
my
aunt
's
back-kitchen
.
One
could
see
*NL*
its
red-tiled
floor
gleaming
like
porphyry
.
It
seemed
not
so
much
the
*NL*
cave
of
Françoise
as
a
little
temple
of
Venus
.
It
would
be
overflowing
*NL*
with
the
offerings
of
the
milkman
,
the
fruiterer
,
the
greengrocer
,
come
*NL*
sometimes
from
distant
villages
to
dedicate
here
the
first-fruits
of
*NL*
their
fields
.
And
its
roof
was
always
surmounted
by
the
cooing
of
a
*NL*
dove
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
earlier
days
I
would
not
have
lingered
in
the
sacred
grove
which
*NL*
surrounded
this
temple
,
for
,
before
going
upstairs
to
read
,
I
would
*NL*
steal
into
the
little
sitting-room
which
my
uncle
Adolphe
,
a
brother
of
*NL*
my
grandfather
and
an
old
soldier
who
had
retired
from
the
service
as
a
*NL*
major
,
used
to
occupy
on
the
ground
floor
,
a
room
which
,
even
when
its
*NL*
opened
windows
let
in
the
heat
,
if
not
actually
the
rays
of
the
sun
*NL*
which
seldom
penetrated
so
far
,
would
never
fail
to
emit
that
vague
and
*NL*
yet
fresh
odour
,
suggesting
at
once
an
open-air
and
an
old-fashioned
*NL*
kind
of
existence
,
which
sets
and
keeps
the
nostrils
dreaming
when
one
*NL*
goes
into
a
disused
gun-room
.
But
for
some
years
now
I
had
not
gone
into
*NL*
my
uncle
Adolphe
's
room
,
since
he
no
longer
came
to
Combray
on
account
*NL*
of
a
quarrel
which
had
arisen
between
him
and
my
family
,
by
my
fault
,
*NL*
and
in
the
following
circumstances
:
Once
or
twice
every
month
,
in
Paris
,
*NL*
I
used
to
be
sent
to
pay
him
a.
visit
,
as
he
was
finishing
his
luncheon
,
*NL*
wearing
a
plain
alpaca
coat
,
and
waited
upon
by
his
servant
in
a
*NL*
working-jacket
of
striped
linen
,
purple
and
white
.
He
would
complain
*NL*
that
I
had
not
been
to
see
him
for
a
long
time
;
that
he
was
being
*NL*
neglected
;
he
would
offer
me
a
marchpane
or
a
tangerine
,
and
we
would
*NL*
cross
a
room
in
which
no
one
ever
sat
,
whose
fire
was
never
lighted
,
*NL*
whose
walls
were
picked
out
with
gilded
mouldings
,
its
ceiling
painted
*NL*
blue
in
imitation
of
the
sky
,
and
its
furniture
upholstered
in
satin
,
as
*NL*
at
my
grandparents
'
,
only
yellow
;
then
we
would
enter
what
he
called
his
*NL*
`
study
,
'
a
room
whose
walls
were
hung
with
prints
which
shewed
,
against
*NL*
a
dark
background
,
a
plump
and
rosy
goddess
driving
a
car
,
or
standing
*NL*
upon
a
globe
,
or
wearing
a
star
on
her
brow
;
pictures
which
were
popular
*NL*
under
the
Second
Empire
because
there
was
thought
to
be
something
about
*NL*
them
that
suggested
Pompeii
,
which
were
then
generally
despised
,
and
*NL*
which
now
people
are
beginning
to
collect
again
for
one
single
and
*NL*
consistent
reason
-LRB-
despite
any
others
which
they
may
advance
-RRB-
,
namely
,
*NL*
that
they
suggest
the
Second
Empire
.
And
there
I
would
stay
with
my
*NL*
uncle
until
his
man
came
,
with
a
message
from
the
coachman
,
to
ask
him
*NL*
at
what
time
he
would
like
the
carriage
.
My
uncle
would
then
be
lost
*NL*
in
meditation
,
while
his
astonished
servant
stood
there
,
not
daring
to
*NL*
disturb
him
by
the
least
movement
,
wondering
and
waiting
for
his
*NL*
answer
,
which
never
varied
.
For
in
the
end
,
after
a
supreme
crisis
of
*NL*
hesitation
,
my
uncle
would
utter
,
infallibly
,
the
words
:
``
A
quarter
past
*NL*
two
,
''
which
the
servant
would
echo
with
amazement
,
but
without
disputing
*NL*
them
:
``
A
quarter
past
two
!
Very
good
,
sir
...
I
will
go
and
tell
him
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
date
I
was
a
lover
of
the
theatre
:
a
Platonic
lover
,
of
*NL*
necessity
,
since
my
parents
had
not
yet
allowed
me
to
enter
one
,
and
*NL*
so
incorrect
was
the
picture
I
drew
for
myself
of
the
pleasures
to
be
*NL*
enjoyed
there
that
I
almost
believed
that
each
of
the
spectators
looked
,
*NL*
as
into
a
stereoscope
,
upon
a
stage
and
scenery
which
existed
for
*NL*
himself
alone
,
though
closely
resembling
the
thousand
other
spectacles
*NL*
presented
to
the
rest
of
the
audience
individually
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
I
would
hasten
to
the
Moriss
column
to
see
what
new
plays
*NL*
it
announced
.
Nothing
could
be
more
disinterested
or
happier
than
the
*NL*
dreams
with
which
these
announcements
filled
my
mind
,
dreams
which
took
*NL*
their
form
from
the
inevitable
associations
of
the
words
forming
the
*NL*
title
of
the
play
,
and
also
from
the
colour
of
the
bills
,
still
damp
and
*NL*
wrinkled
with
paste
,
on
which
those
words
stood
out
.
Nothing
,
unless
*NL*
it
were
such
strange
titles
as
the
_
Testament
de
César
Girodot
,
or
*NL*
Oedipe-Roi
_
,
inscribed
not
on
the
green
bills
of
the
Opéra-Comique
,
but
*NL*
on
the
wine-coloured
bills
of
the
Comédie-Française
,
nothing
seemed
*NL*
to
me
to
differ
more
profoundly
from
the
sparkling
white
plume
of
*NL*
the
_
Diamants
de
la
Couronne
_
than
the
sleek
,
mysterious
satin
of
the
*NL*
_
Domino
Noir
_
;
and
since
my
parents
had
told
me
that
,
for
my
first
visit
*NL*
to
the
theatre
,
I
should
have
to
choose
between
these
two
pieces
,
I
*NL*
would
study
exhaustively
and
in
turn
the
title
of
one
and
the
title
*NL*
of
the
other
-LRB-
for
those
were
all
that
I
knew
of
either
-RRB-
,
attempting
to
*NL*
snatch
from
each
a
foretaste
of
the
pleasure
which
it
offered
me
,
and
to
*NL*
compare
this
pleasure
with
that
latent
in
the
other
title
,
until
in
the
*NL*
end
I
had
shewn
myself
such
vivid
,
such
compelling
pictures
of
,
on
*NL*
the
one
hand
,
a
play
of
dazzling
arrogance
,
and
on
the
other
a
gentle
,
*NL*
velvety
play
,
that
I
was
as
little
capable
of
deciding
which
play
I
*NL*
should
prefer
to
see
as
if
,
at
the
dinner-table
,
they
had
obliged
me
to
*NL*
choose
between
_
rice
à
l'Impératrice
_
and
the
famous
cream
of
chocolate
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
my
conversations
with
my
playfellows
bore
upon
actors
,
whose
art
,
*NL*
although
as
yet
I
had
no
experience
of
it
,
was
the
first
of
all
its
*NL*
numberless
forms
in
which
Art
itself
allowed
me
to
anticipate
its
*NL*
enjoyment
.
Between
one
actor
's
tricks
of
intonation
and
inflection
and
*NL*
another
's
,
the
most
trifling
differences
would
strike
me
as
being
of
an
*NL*
incalculable
importance
.
And
from
what
I
had
been
told
of
them
I
would
*NL*
arrange
them
in
the
order
of
their
talent
in
lists
which
I
used
to
*NL*
murmur
to
myself
all
day
long
:
lists
which
in
the
end
became
petrified
*NL*
in
my
brain
and
were
a
source
of
annoyance
to
it
,
being
irremovable
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
later
,
in
my
schooldays
,
whenever
I
ventured
in
class
,
when
the
*NL*
master
's
head
was
turned
,
to
communicate
with
some
new
friend
,
I
would
*NL*
always
begin
by
asking
him
whether
he
had
begun
yet
to
go
to
theatres
,
*NL*
and
if
he
agreed
that
our
greatest
actor
was
undoubtedly
Got
,
our
second
*NL*
Delaunay
,
and
so
on
.
And
if
,
in
his
judgment
,
Febvre
came
below
Thiron
,
*NL*
or
Delaunay
below
Coquelin
,
the
sudden
volatility
which
the
name
of
*NL*
Coquelin
,
forsaking
its
stony
rigidity
,
would
engender
in
my
mind
,
in
*NL*
which
it
moved
upwards
to
the
second
place
,
the
rich
vitality
with
which
*NL*
the
name
of
Delaunay
would
suddenly
be
furnished
,
to
enable
it
to
slip
*NL*
down
to
fourth
,
would
stimulate
and
fertilise
my
brain
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
bradding
and
blossoming
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
the
thought
of
actors
weighed
so
upon
me
,
if
the
sight
of
*NL*
Maubant
,
coming
out
one
afternoon
from
the
Théâtre-Français
,
had
plunged
*NL*
me
in
the
throes
and
sufferings
of
hopeless
love
,
how
much
more
did
the
*NL*
name
of
a
`
star
,
'
blazing
outside
the
doors
of
a
theatre
,
how
much
more
,
*NL*
seen
through
the
window
of
a
brougham
which
passed
me
in
the
street
,
the
*NL*
hair
over
her
forehead
abloom
with
roses
,
did
the
face
of
a
woman
who
,
*NL*
I
would
think
,
was
perhaps
an
actress
,
leave
with
me
a
lasting
*NL*
disturbance
,
a
futile
and
painful
effort
to
form
a
picture
of
her
*NL*
private
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
classified
,
in
order
of
talent
,
the
most
distinguished
:
Sarah
*NL*
Bernhardt
,
Berma
,
Bartet
,
Madeleine
Brohan
,
Jeanne
Samary
;
but
I
was
*NL*
interested
in
them
all
.
Now
my
uncle
knew
many
of
them
personally
,
and
*NL*
also
ladies
of
another
class
,
not
clearly
distinguished
from
actresses
*NL*
in
my
mind
.
He
used
to
entertain
them
at
his
house
.
And
if
we
went
to
*NL*
see
him
on
certain
days
only
,
that
was
because
on
the
other
days
ladies
*NL*
might
come
whom
his
family
could
not
very
well
have
met
.
So
we
at
least
*NL*
thought
;
as
for
my
uncle
,
his
fatal
readiness
to
pay
pretty
widows
-LRB-
who
*NL*
had
perhaps
never
been
married
-RRB-
and
countesses
-LRB-
whose
high-sounding
*NL*
titles
were
probably
no
more
than
_
noms
de
guerre
_
-RRB-
the
compliment
of
*NL*
presenting
them
to
my
grandmother
or
even
of
presenting
to
them
some
*NL*
of
our
family
jewels
,
had
already
embroiled
him
more
than
once
with
*NL*
my
grandfather
.
Often
,
if
the
name
of
some
actress
were
mentioned
in
*NL*
conversation
,
I
would
hear
my
father
say
,
with
a
smile
,
to
my
mother
:
*NL*
``
One
of
your
uncle
's
friends
,
''
and
I
would
think
of
the
weary
novitiate
*NL*
through
which
,
perhaps
for
years
on
end
,
a
grown
man
,
even
a
man
of
real
*NL*
importance
,
might
have
to
pass
,
waiting
on
the
doorstep
of
some
such
*NL*
lady
,
while
she
refused
to
answer
his
letters
and
made
her
hall-porter
*NL*
drive
him
away
;
and
imagine
that
my
uncle
was
able
to
dispense
a
little
*NL*
jackanapes
like
myself
from
all
these
sufferings
by
introducing
me
in
*NL*
his
own
home
to
the
actress
,
unapproachable
by
all
the
world
,
but
for
*NL*
him
an
intimate
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
--
on
the
pretext
that
some
lesson
,
the
hour
of
which
had
been
*NL*
altered
,
now
came
at
such
an
awkward
time
that
it
had
already
more
than
*NL*
once
prevented
me
,
and
would
continue
to
prevent
me
,
from
seeing
my
*NL*
uncle
--
one
day
,
not
one
of
the
days
which
he
set
apart
for
our
visits
,
I
*NL*
took
advantage
of
the
fact
that
my
parents
had
had
luncheon
earlier
*NL*
than
usual
;
I
slipped
out
and
,
instead
of
going
to
read
the
playbills
on
*NL*
their
column
,
for
which
purpose
I
was
allowed
to
go
out
unaccompanied
,
*NL*
I
ran
all
the
way
to
his
house
.
I
noticed
before
his
door
a
carriage
and
*NL*
pair
,
with
red
carnations
on
the
horses
'
blinkers
and
in
the
coachman
's
*NL*
buttonhole
.
As
I
climbed
the
staircase
I
could
hear
laughter
and
a
*NL*
woman
's
voice
,
and
,
as
soon
as
I
had
rung
,
silence
and
the
sound
of
*NL*
shutting
doors
.
The
man-servant
who
let
me
in
appeared
embarrassed
,
and
*NL*
said
that
my
uncle
was
extremely
busy
and
probably
could
not
see
me
;
he
*NL*
went
in
,
however
,
to
announce
my
arrival
,
and
the
same
voice
I
had
heard
*NL*
before
said
:
``
Oh
,
yes
!
Do
let
him
come
in
;
just
for
a
moment
;
it
will
be
*NL*
so
amusing
.
Is
that
his
photograph
there
,
on
your
desk
?
And
his
mother
*NL*
-LRB-
your
niece
,
is
n't
she
?
-RRB-
beside
it
?
The
image
of
her
,
is
n't
he
?
I
should
*NL*
so
like
to
see
the
little
chap
,
just
for
a
second
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hear
my
uncle
grumbling
and
growing
angry
;
finally
the
*NL*
manservant
told
me
to
come
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
table
was
the
same
plate
of
marchpanes
that
was
always
there
;
my
*NL*
uncle
wore
the
same
alpaca
coat
as
on
other
days
;
but
opposite
to
him
,
*NL*
in
a
pink
silk
dress
with
a
great
necklace
of
pearls
about
her
throat
,
*NL*
sat
a
young
woman
who
was
just
finishing
a
tangerine
.
My
uncertainty
*NL*
whether
I
ought
to
address
her
as
Madame
or
Mademoiselle
made
me
blush
,
*NL*
and
not
daring
to
look
too
much
in
her
direction
,
in
case
I
should
be
*NL*
obliged
to
speak
to
her
,
I
hurried
across
to
kiss
my
uncle
.
She
looked
*NL*
at
me
and
smiled
;
my
uncle
said
``
My
nephew
!
''
without
telling
her
my
name
*NL*
or
telling
me
hers
,
doubtless
because
,
since
his
difficulties
with
*NL*
my
grandfather
,
he
had
endeavoured
as
far
as
possible
to
avoid
any
*NL*
association
of
his
family
with
this
other
class
of
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
like
his
mother
he
is
,
''
said
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
never
seen
my
niece
,
except
in
photographs
,
''
my
uncle
*NL*
broke
in
quickly
,
with
a
note
of
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
dear
friend
,
I
passed
her
on
the
staircase
last
year
*NL*
when
you
were
so
ill
.
It
is
true
I
only
saw
her
for
a
moment
,
and
your
*NL*
staircase
is
rather
dark
;
but
I
saw
well
enough
to
see
how
lovely
she
*NL*
was
.
This
young
gentleman
has
her
beautiful
eyes
,
and
also
this
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
,
tracing
a
line
with
one
finger
across
the
lower
part
of
her
*NL*
forehead
.
``
Tell
me
,
''
she
asked
my
uncle
,
``
is
your
niece
Mme.
--
;
is
her
*NL*
name
the
same
as
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
takes
most
after
his
father
,
''
muttered
my
uncle
,
who
was
no
more
*NL*
anxious
to
effect
an
introduction
by
proxy
,
in
repeating
Mamma
's
name
*NL*
aloud
,
than
to
bring
the
two
together
in
the
flesh
.
``
He
's
his
father
all
*NL*
over
,
and
also
like
my
poor
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
met
his
father
,
dear
,
''
said
the
lady
in
pink
,
bowing
her
*NL*
head
slightly
,
``
and
I
never
saw
your
poor
mother
.
You
will
remember
it
*NL*
was
just
after
your
great
sorrow
that
we
got
to
know
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
somewhat
disillusioned
,
for
this
young
lady
was
in
no
way
*NL*
different
from
other
pretty
women
whom
I
had
seen
from
time
to
time
at
*NL*
home
,
especially
the
daughter
of
one
of
our
cousins
,
to
whose
house
I
*NL*
went
every
New
Year
's
Day
.
Only
better
dressed
;
otherwise
my
uncle
's
*NL*
friend
had
the
same
quick
and
kindly
glance
,
the
same
frank
and
friendly
*NL*
manner
.
I
could
find
no
trace
in
her
of
the
theatrical
appearance
*NL*
which
I
admired
in
photographs
of
actresses
,
nothing
of
the
diabolical
*NL*
expression
which
would
have
been
in
keeping
with
the
life
she
must
lead
.
*NL*
I
had
difficulty
in
believing
that
this
was
one
of
`
those
women
,
'
and
*NL*
certainly
I
should
never
have
believed
her
one
of
the
`
smart
ones
'
had
I
*NL*
not
seen
the
carriage
and
pair
,
the
pink
dress
,
the
pearly
necklace
,
had
*NL*
I
not
been
aware
,
too
,
that
my
uncle
knew
only
the
very
best
of
them
.
*NL*
But
I
asked
myself
how
the
millionaire
who
gave
her
her
carriage
and
her
*NL*
flat
and
her
jewels
could
find
any
pleasure
in
flinging
his
money
away
*NL*
upon
a
woman
who
had
so
simple
and
respectable
an
appearance
.
And
yet
,
*NL*
when
I
thought
of
what
her
life
must
be
like
,
its
immorality
disturbed
*NL*
me
more
,
perhaps
,
than
if
it
had
stood
before
me
in
some
concrete
and
*NL*
recognisable
form
,
by
its
secrecy
and
invisibility
,
like
the
plot
of
a
*NL*
novel
,
the
hidden
truth
of
a
scandal
which
had
driven
out
of
the
home
*NL*
of
her
middle-class
parents
and
dedicated
to
the
service
of
all
mankind
*NL*
which
had
brought
to
the
flowering-point
of
her
beauty
,
had
raised
*NL*
to
fame
or
notoriety
this
woman
,
the
play
of
whose
features
,
the
*NL*
intonations
of
whose
voice
,
like
so
many
others
I
already
knew
,
made
me
*NL*
regard
her
,
in
spite
of
myself
,
as
a
young
lady
of
good
family
,
her
who
*NL*
was
no
longer
of
a
family
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
gone
by
this
time
into
the
`
study
,
'
and
my
uncle
,
who
seemed
a
*NL*
trifle
embarrassed
by
my
presence
,
offered
her
a
cigarette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
dear
friend
,
''
she
said
.
``
You
know
I
only
smoke
the
ones
*NL*
the
Grand
Duke
sends
me
.
I
tell
him
that
they
make
you
jealous
.
''
And
*NL*
she
drew
from
a
case
cigarettes
covered
with
inscriptions
in
gold
,
in
*NL*
a
foreign
language
.
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
she
began
again
suddenly
.
``
Of
course
I
*NL*
have
met
this
young
man
's
father
with
you
.
Is
n't
he
your
nephew
?
How
on
*NL*
earth
could
I
have
forgotten
?
He
was
so
nice
,
so
charming
to
me
,
''
she
*NL*
went
on
,
modestly
and
with
feeling
.
But
when
I
thought
to
myself
what
*NL*
must
actually
have
been
the
rude
greeting
-LRB-
which
,
she
made
out
,
had
been
*NL*
so
charming
-RRB-
,
I
,
who
knew
my
father
's
coldness
and
reserve
,
was
shocked
,
*NL*
as
though
at
some
indelicacy
on
his
part
,
at
the
contrast
between
the
*NL*
excessive
recognition
bestowed
on
it
and
his
never
adequate
geniality
.
*NL*
It
has
since
struck
me
as
one
of
the
most
touching
aspects
of
the
part
*NL*
played
in
life
by
these
idle
,
painstaking
women
that
they
devote
*NL*
all
their
generosity
,
all
their
talent
,
their
transferable
dreams
of
*NL*
sentimental
beauty
-LRB-
for
,
like
all
artists
,
they
never
seek
to
realise
*NL*
the
value
of
those
dreams
,
or
to
enclose
them
in
the
four-square
frame
*NL*
of
everyday
life
-RRB-
,
and
their
gold
,
which
counts
for
little
,
to
the
*NL*
fashioning
of
a
fine
and
precious
setting
for
the
rubbed
and
scratched
*NL*
and
ill-polished
lives
of
men
.
And
just
as
this
one
filled
the
*NL*
smoking-room
,
where
my
uncle
was
entertaining
her
in
his
alpaca
coat
,
*NL*
with
her
charming
person
,
her
dress
of
pink
silk
,
her
pearls
,
and
the
*NL*
refinement
suggested
by
intimacy
with
a
Grand
Duke
,
so
,
in
the
same
*NL*
way
,
she
had
taken
some
casual
remark
by
my
father
,
had
worked
it
up
*NL*
delicately
,
given
it
a
`
turn
,
'
a
precious
title
,
set
in
it
the
gem
of
a
*NL*
glance
from
her
own
eyes
,
a
gem
of
the
first
water
,
blended
of
humility
*NL*
and
gratitude
;
and
so
had
given
it
back
transformed
into
a
jewel
,
a
work
*NL*
of
art
,
into
something
altogether
charming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
my
boy
,
it
is
time
you
went
away
,
''
said
my
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
;
I
could
scarcely
resist
a
desire
to
kiss
the
hand
of
the
lady
*NL*
in
pink
,
but
I
felt
that
to
do
so
would
require
as
much
audacity
as
a
*NL*
forcible
abduction
of
her
.
My
heart
beat
loud
while
I
counted
out
to
*NL*
myself
``
Shall
I
do
it
,
shall
I
not
?
''
and
then
I
ceased
to
ask
myself
*NL*
what
I
ought
to
do
so
as
at
least
to
do
something
.
Blindly
,
hotly
,
*NL*
madly
,
flinging
aside
all
the
reasons
I
had
just
found
to
support
such
*NL*
action
,
I
seized
and
raised
to
my
lips
the
hand
she
held
out
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
he
delicious
!
Quite
a
ladies
'
man
already
;
he
takes
after
his
*NL*
uncle
.
He
'll
be
a
perfect
`
gentleman
,
'
''
she
went
on
,
setting
her
teeth
*NL*
so
as
to
give
the
word
a
kind
of
English
accentuation
.
``
Could
n't
he
come
*NL*
to
me
some
day
for
'
a
cup
of
tea
,
'
as
our
friends
across
the
channel
*NL*
say
;
he
need
only
send
me
a
`
blue
'
in
the
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
the
least
idea
of
what
a
`
blue
'
might
be
.
I
did
not
understand
*NL*
half
the
words
which
the
lady
used
,
but
my
fear
lest
there
should
be
*NL*
concealed
in
them
some
question
which
it
would
be
impolite
in
me
not
to
*NL*
answer
kept
me
from
withdrawing
my
close
attention
from
them
,
and
I
was
*NL*
beginning
to
feel
extremely
tired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
it
is
impossible
,
''
said
my
uncle
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
``
He
*NL*
is
kept
busy
at
home
all
day
;
he
has
plenty
of
work
to
do
.
He
brings
*NL*
back
all
the
prizes
from
his
school
,
''
he
added
in
a
lower
tone
,
so
that
*NL*
I
should
not
hear
this
falsehood
and
interrupt
with
a
contradiction
.
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
tell
;
he
may
turn
out
a
little
Victor
Hugo
,
a
kind
of
*NL*
Vaulabelle
,
do
n't
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
love
artistic
people
,
''
replied
the
lady
in
pink
;
``
there
is
no
*NL*
one
like
them
for
understanding
women
.
Them
,
and
really
nice
men
like
*NL*
yourself
.
But
please
forgive
my
ignorance
.
Who
,
what
is
Vaulabelle
?
Is
*NL*
it
those
gilt
books
in
the
little
glass
case
in
your
drawing-room
?
You
*NL*
know
you
promised
to
lend
them
to
me
;
I
will
take
great
care
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
,
who
hated
lending
people
books
,
said
nothing
,
and
ushered
me
*NL*
out
into
the
hall
.
Madly
in
love
with
the
lady
in
pink
,
I
covered
my
*NL*
old
uncle
's
tobacco-stained
cheeks
with
passionate
kisses
,
and
while
he
,
*NL*
awkwardly
enough
,
gave
me
to
understand
-LRB-
without
actually
saying
-RRB-
that
*NL*
he
would
rather
I
did
not
tell
my
parents
about
this
visit
,
I
assured
*NL*
him
,
with
tears
in
my
eyes
,
that
his
kindness
had
made
so
strong
an
*NL*
impression
upon
me
that
some
day
I
would
most
certainly
find
a
way
of
*NL*
expressing
my
gratitude
.
So
strong
an
impression
had
it
made
upon
me
*NL*
that
two
hours
later
,
after
a
string
of
mysterious
utterances
which
did
*NL*
not
strike
me
as
giving
my
parents
a
sufficiently
clear
idea
of
the
new
*NL*
importance
with
which
I
had
been
invested
,
I
found
it
simpler
to
let
*NL*
them
have
a
full
account
,
omitting
no
detail
,
of
the
visit
I
had
paid
*NL*
that
afternoon
.
In
doing
this
I
had
no
thought
of
causing
my
uncle
any
*NL*
unpleasantness
.
How
could
I
have
thought
such
a
thing
,
since
I
did
not
*NL*
wish
it
?
And
I
could
not
suppose
that
my
parents
would
see
any
harm
in
*NL*
a
visit
in
which
I
myself
saw
none
.
Every
day
of
our
lives
does
not
*NL*
some
friend
or
other
ask
us
to
make
his
apologies
,
without
fail
,
to
some
*NL*
woman
to
whom
he
has
been
prevented
from
writing
;
and
do
not
we
forget
*NL*
to
do
so
,
feeling
that
this
woman
can
not
attach
much
importance
to
a
*NL*
silence
which
has
none
for
ourselves
?
I
imagined
,
like
everyone
else
,
*NL*
that
the
brains
of
other
people
were
lifeless
and
submissive
receptacles
*NL*
with
no
power
of
specific
reaction
to
any
stimulus
which
might
be
*NL*
applied
to
them
;
and
I
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
when
I
deposited
in
*NL*
the
minds
of
my
parents
the
news
of
the
acquaintance
I
had
made
at
my
*NL*
uncle
's
I
should
at
the
same
time
transmit
to
them
the
kindly
judgment
*NL*
I
myself
had
based
on
the
introduction
.
Unfortunately
my
parents
had
*NL*
recourse
to
principles
entirely
different
from
those
which
I
suggested
*NL*
they
should
adopt
when
they
came
to
form
their
estimate
of
my
uncle
's
*NL*
conduct
.
My
father
and
grandfather
had
`
words
'
with
him
of
a
violent
*NL*
order
;
as
I
learned
indirectly
.
A
few
days
later
,
passing
my
uncle
in
*NL*
the
street
as
he
drove
by
in
an
open
carriage
,
Î
felt
at
once
all
the
*NL*
grief
,
the
gratitude
,
the
remorse
which
I
should
have
liked
to
convey
to
*NL*
him
.
Beside
the
immensity
of
these
emotions
I
considered
that
merely
to
*NL*
raise
my
hat
to
him
would
be
incongruous
and
petty
,
and
might
make
*NL*
him
think
that
I
regarded
myself
as
bound
to
shew
him
no
more
than
the
*NL*
commonest
form
of
courtesy
.
I
decided
to
abstain
from
so
inadequate
a
*NL*
gesture
,
and
turned
my
head
away
.
My
uncle
thought
that
,
in
doing
so
I
*NL*
was
obeying
my
parents
'
orders
;
he
never
forgave
them
;
and
though
he
*NL*
did
not
die
until
many
years
later
,
not
one
of
us
ever
set
eyes
on
him
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
I
no
longer
used
to
go
into
the
little
sitting-room
-LRB-
now
kept
*NL*
shut
-RRB-
of
my
uncle
Adolphe
;
instead
,
after
hanging
about
on
the
outskirts
*NL*
of
the
back-kitchen
until
Françoise
appeared
on
its
threshold
and
*NL*
announced
:
``
I
am
going
to
let
the
kitchen-maid
serve
the
coffee
and
take
*NL*
up
the
hot
water
;
it
is
time
I
went
off
to
Mme.
Octave
,
''
I
would
then
*NL*
decide
to
go
indoors
,
and
would
go
straight
upstairs
to
my
room
to
read
.
*NL*
The
kitchen-maid
was
an
abstract
personality
,
a
permanent
institution
*NL*
to
which
an
invariable
set
of
attributes
assured
a
sort
of
fixity
and
*NL*
continuity
and
identity
throughout
the
long
series
of
transitory
human
*NL*
shapes
in
which
that
personality
was
incarnate
;
for
we
never
found
the
*NL*
same
girl
there
two
years
running
.
In
the
year
in
which
we
ate
such
*NL*
quantities
of
asparagus
,
the
kitchen-maid
whose
duty
it
was
to
dress
*NL*
them
was
a
poor
sickly
creature
,
some
way
`
gone
'
in
pregnancy
when
*NL*
we
arrived
at
Combray
for
Easter
,
and
it
was
indeed
surprising
that
*NL*
Françoise
allowed
her
to
run
so
many
errands
in
the
town
and
to
do
so
*NL*
much
work
in
the
house
,
for
she
was
beginning
to
find
a
difficulty
in
*NL*
bearing
before
her
the
mysterious
casket
,
fuller
and
larger
every
day
,
*NL*
whose
splendid
outline
could
be
detected
through
the
folds
of
her
ample
*NL*
smocks
.
These
last
recalled
the
cloaks
in
which
Giotto
shrouds
some
of
*NL*
the
allegorical
figures
in
his
paintings
,
of
which
M.
Swann
had
given
*NL*
me
photographs
.
He
it
was
who
pointed
out
the
resemblance
,
and
when
he
*NL*
inquired
after
the
kitchen-maid
he
would
say
:
``
Well
,
how
goes
it
with
*NL*
Giotto
's
Charity
?
''
And
indeed
the
poor
girl
,
whose
pregnancy
had
swelled
*NL*
and
stoutened
every
part
of
her
,
even
to
her
face
,
and
the
vertical
,
*NL*
squared
outlines
of
her
cheeks
,
did
distinctly
suggest
those
virgins
,
*NL*
so
strong
and
mannish
as
to
seem
matrons
rather
,
in
whom
the
Virtues
are
*NL*
personified
in
the
Arena
Chapel
.
And
I
can
see
now
that
those
Virtues
*NL*
and
Vices
of
Padua
resembled
her
in
another
respect
as
well
.
For
just
as
*NL*
the
figure
of
this
girl
had
been
enlarged
by
the
additional
symbol
which
*NL*
she
carried
in
her
body
,
without
appearing
to
understand
what
it
meant
,
*NL*
without
any
rendering
in
her
facial
expression
of
all
its
beauty
and
*NL*
spiritual
significance
,
but
carried
as
if
it
were
an
ordinary
and
rather
*NL*
heavy
burden
,
so
it
is
without
any
apparent
suspicion
of
what
she
is
*NL*
about
that
the
powerfully
built
housewife
who
is
portrayed
in
the
Arena
*NL*
beneath
the
label
`
Caritas
,
'
and
a
reproduction
of
whose
portrait
hung
*NL*
upon
the
wall
of
my
schoolroom
at
Combray
,
incarnates
that
virtue
,
for
*NL*
it
seems
impossible
,
that
any
thought
of
charity
can
ever
have
found
*NL*
expression
in
her
vulgar
and
energetic
face
.
By
a
fine
stroke
of
the
*NL*
painter
's
invention
she
is
tumbling
all
the
treasures
of
the
earth
at
*NL*
her
feet
,
but
exactly
as
if
she
were
treading
grapes
in
a
wine-press
to
*NL*
extract
their
juice
,
or
,
still
more
,
as
if
she
had
climbed
on
a
heap
of
*NL*
sacks
to
raise
herself
higher
;
and
she
is
holding
out
her
flaming
heart
*NL*
to
God
,
or
shall
we
say
`
handing
'
it
to
Him
,
exactly
as
a
cook
might
*NL*
hand
up
a
corkscrew
through
the
skylight
of
her
underground
kitchen
to
*NL*
some
one
who
had
called
down
to
ask
her
for
it
from
the
ground-level
*NL*
above
.
The
`
Invidia
,
'
again
,
should
have
had
some
look
on
her
face
of
*NL*
envy
.
But
in
this
fresco
,
too
,
the
symbol
occupies
so
large
a
place
and
*NL*
is
represented
with
such
realism
;
the
serpent
hissing
between
the
lips
*NL*
of
Envy
is
so
huge
,
and
so
completely
fills
her
wide-opened
mouth
that
*NL*
the
muscles
of
her
face
are
strained
and
contorted
,
like
a
child
's
who
*NL*
is
filling
a
balloon
with
his
breath
,
and
that
Envy
,
and
we
ourselves
*NL*
for
that
matter
,
when
we
look
at
her
,
since
all
her
attention
and
ours
*NL*
are
concentrated
on
the
action
of
her
lips
,
have
no
time
,
almost
,
to
*NL*
spare
for
envious
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
all
the
admiration
that
M.
Swann
might
profess
for
these
figures
*NL*
of
Giotto
,
it
was
a
long
time
before
I
could
find
any
pleasure
in
seeing
*NL*
in
our
schoolroom
-LRB-
where
the
copies
he
had
brought
me
were
hung
-RRB-
that
*NL*
Charity
devoid
of
charity
,
that
Envy
who
looked
like
nothing
so
much
*NL*
as
a
plate
in
some
medical
book
,
illustrating
the
compression
of
the
*NL*
glottis
or
uvula
by
a
tumour
in
the
tongue
,
or
by
the
introduction
of
*NL*
the
operator
's
instrument
,
a
Justice
whose
greyish
and
meanly
regular
*NL*
features
were
the
very
same
as
those
which
adorned
the
faces
of
certain
*NL*
good
and
pious
and
slightly
withered
ladies
of
Combray
whom
I
used
to
*NL*
see
at
mass
,
many
of
whom
had
long
been
enrolled
in
the
reserve
forces
*NL*
of
Injustice
.
But
in
later
years
I
understood
that
the
arresting
*NL*
strangeness
,
the
special
beauty
of
these
frescoes
lay
in
the
great
part
*NL*
played
in
each
of
them
by
its
symbols
,
while
the
fact
that
these
*NL*
were
depicted
,
not
as
symbols
-LRB-
for
the
thought
symbolised
was
nowhere
*NL*
expressed
-RRB-
,
but
as
real
things
,
actually
felt
or
materially
handled
,
*NL*
added
something
more
precise
and
more
literal
to
their
meaning
,
*NL*
something
more
concrete
and
more
striking
to
the
lesson
they
imparted
.
*NL*
And
even
in
the
case
of
the
poor
kitchen-maid
,
was
not
our
attention
*NL*
incessantly
drawn
to
her
belly
by
the
load
which
filled
it
;
and
in
the
*NL*
same
way
,
again
,
are
not
the
thoughts
of
men
and
women
in
the
agony
of
*NL*
death
often
turned
towards
the
practical
,
painful
,
obscure
,
internal
,
*NL*
intestinal
aspect
,
towards
that
`
seamy
side
'
of
death
which
is
,
as
it
*NL*
happens
,
the
side
that
death
actually
presents
to
them
and
forces
them
*NL*
to
feel
,
a
side
which
far
more
closely
resembles
a
crushing
burden
,
a
*NL*
difficulty
in
breathing
,
a
destroying
thirst
,
than
the
abstract
idea
to
*NL*
which
we
are
accustomed
to
give
the
name
of
Death
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
must
have
been
a
strong
element
of
reality
in
those
Virtues
and
*NL*
Vices
of
Padua
,
since
they
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
much
alive
as
*NL*
the
pregnant
servant-girl
,
while
she
herself
appeared
scarcely
less
*NL*
allegorical
than
they
.
And
,
quite
possibly
,
this
lack
-LRB-
or
seeming
lack
-RRB-
*NL*
of
participation
by
a
person
's
soul
in
the
significant
marks
of
its
own
*NL*
special
virtue
has
,
apart
from
its
aesthetic
meaning
,
a
reality
which
,
*NL*
if
not
strictly
psychological
,
may
at
least
be
called
physiognomical
.
*NL*
Later
on
,
when
,
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
I
have
had
occasion
to
meet
*NL*
with
,
in
convents
for
instance
,
literally
saintly
examples
of
practical
*NL*
charity
,
they
have
generally
had
the
brisk
,
decided
,
undisturbed
,
and
*NL*
slightly
brutal
air
of
a
busy
surgeon
,
the
face
in
which
one
can
discern
*NL*
no
commiseration
,
no
tenderness
at
the
sight
of
suffering
humanity
,
and
*NL*
no
fear
of
hurting
it
,
the
face
devoid
of
gentleness
or
sympathy
,
the
*NL*
sublime
face
of
true
goodness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
while
the
kitchen-maid
--
who
,
all
unawares
,
made
the
superior
*NL*
qualities
of
Françoise
shine
with
added
lustre
,
just
as
Error
,
by
*NL*
force
of
contrast
,
enhances
the
triumph
of
Truth
--
took
in
coffee
which
*NL*
-LRB-
according
to
Mamma
-RRB-
was
nothing
more
than
hot
water
,
and
then
carried
*NL*
up
to
our
rooms
hot
water
which
was
barely
tepid
,
I
would
be
lying
*NL*
stretched
out
on
my
bed
,
a
book
in
my
hand
,
in
my
room
which
trembled
*NL*
with
the
effort
to
defend
its
frail
,
transparent
coolness
against
the
*NL*
afternoon
sun
,
behind
its
almost
closed
shutters
through
which
,
however
,
*NL*
a
reflection
of
the
sunlight
had
contrived
to
slip
in
on
its
golden
*NL*
wings
,
remaining
motionless
,
between
glass
and
woodwork
,
in
a
corner
,
*NL*
like
a
butterfly
poised
upon
a
flower
.
It
was
hardly
light
enough
for
*NL*
me
to
read
,
and
my
feeling
of
the
day
's
brightness
and
splendour
was
*NL*
derived
solely
from
the
blows
struck
down
below
,
in
the
Rue
de
la
Curé
,
*NL*
by
Camus
-LRB-
whom
Françoise
had
assured
that
my
aunt
was
not
`
resting
'
and
*NL*
that
he
might
therefore
make
a
noise
-RRB-
,
upon
some
old
packing-cases
from
*NL*
which
nothing
would
really
be
sent
flying
but
the
dust
,
though
the
din
*NL*
of
them
,
in
the
resonant
atmosphere
that
accompanies
hot
weather
,
seemed
*NL*
to
scatter
broadcast
a
rain
of
blood-red
stars
;
and
from
the
flies
who
*NL*
performed
for
my
benefit
,
in
their
small
concert
,
as
it
might
be
the
*NL*
chamber
music
of
summer
;
evoking
heat
and
light
quite
differently
from
*NL*
an
air
of
human
music
which
,
if
you
happen
to
have
heard
it
during
a
*NL*
fine
summer
,
will
always
bring
that
summer
back
to
your
mind
,
the
flies
'
*NL*
music
is
bound
to
the
season
by
a
closer
,
a
more
vital
tie
--
born
of
*NL*
sunny
days
,
and
not
to
be
reborn
but
with
them
,
containing
something
*NL*
of
their
essential
nature
,
it
not
merely
calls
up
their
image
in
our
*NL*
memory
,
but
gives
us
a
guarantee
that
they
do
really
exist
,
that
they
*NL*
are
close
around
us
,
immediately
accessible
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dim
freshness
of
my
room
was
to
the
broad
daylight
of
the
street
*NL*
what
the
shadow
is
to
the
sunbeam
,
that
is
to
say
,
equally
luminous
,
*NL*
and
presented
to
my
imagination
the
entire
panorama
of
summer
,
which
*NL*
my
senses
,
if
I
had
been
out
walking
,
could
have
tasted
and
enjoyed
in
*NL*
fragments
only
;
and
so
was
quite
in
harmony
with
my
state
of
repose
,
*NL*
which
-LRB-
thanks
to
the
adventures
related
in
my
books
,
which
had
just
*NL*
excited
it
-RRB-
bore
,
like
a
hand
reposing
motionless
in
a
stream
of
running
*NL*
water
,
the
shock
and
animation
of
a
torrent
of
activity
and
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
grandmother
,
even
if
the
weather
,
after
growing
too
hot
,
had
*NL*
broken
,
and
a
storm
,
or
just
a
shower
,
had
burst
over
us
,
would
come
up
*NL*
and
beg
me
to
go
outside
.
And
as
I
did
not
wish
to
leave
off
my
book
,
I
*NL*
would
go
on
with
it
in
the
garden
,
under
the
chestnut-tree
,
in
a
little
*NL*
sentry-box
of
canvas
and
matting
,
in
the
farthest
recesses
of
which
I
*NL*
used
to
sit
and
feel
that
I
was
hidden
from
the
eyes
of
anyone
who
might
*NL*
be
coming
to
call
upon
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
my
thoughts
,
did
not
they
form
a
similar
sort
of
hiding-hole
,
*NL*
in
the
depths
of
which
I
felt
that
I
could
bury
myself
and
remain
*NL*
invisible
even
when
I
was
looking
at
what
went
on
outside
?
When
I
saw
*NL*
any
external
object
,
my
consciousness
that
I
was
seeing
it
would
remain
*NL*
between
me
and
it
,
enclosing
it
in
a
slender
,
incorporeal
outline
which
*NL*
prevented
me
from
ever
coming
directly
in
contact
with
the
material
*NL*
form
;
for
it
would
volatilise
itself
in
some
way
before
I
could
touch
*NL*
it
,
just
as
an
incandescent
body
which
is
moved
towards
something
wet
*NL*
never
actually
touches
moisture
,
since
it
is
always
preceded
,
itself
,
by
*NL*
a
zone
of
evaporation
.
Upon
the
sort
of
screen
,
patterned
with
different
*NL*
states
and
impressions
,
which
my
consciousness
would
quietly
unfold
*NL*
while
I
was
reading
,
and
which
ranged
from
the
most
deeply
hidden
*NL*
aspirations
of
my
heart
to
the
wholly
external
view
of
the
horizon
*NL*
spread
out
before
my
eyes
at
the
foot
of
the
garden
,
what
was
from
the
*NL*
first
the
most
permanent
and
the
most
intimate
part
of
me
,
the
lever
*NL*
whose
incessant
movements
controlled
all
the
rest
,
was
my
belief
in
the
*NL*
philosophic
richness
and
beauty
of
the
book
I
was
reading
,
and
my
desire
*NL*
to
appropriate
these
to
myself
,
whatever
the
book
might
be
.
For
even
if
*NL*
I
had
purchased
it
at
Combray
,
having
seen
it
outside
Borange
's
,
whose
*NL*
grocery
lay
too
far
from
our
house
for
Françoise
to
be
able
to
deal
*NL*
there
,
as
she
did
with
Camus
,
but
who
enjoyed
better
custom
as
a
*NL*
stationer
and
bookseller
;
even
if
I
had
seen
it
,
tied
with
string
to
*NL*
keep
it
in
its
place
in
the
mosaic
of
monthly
parts
and
pamphlets
which
*NL*
adorned
either
side
of
his
doorway
,
a
doorway
more
mysterious
,
more
*NL*
teeming
with
suggestion
than
that
of
a
cathedral
,
I
should
have
noticed
*NL*
and
bought
it
there
simply
because
I
had
recognised
it
as
a
book
which
*NL*
had
been
well
spoken
of
,
in
my
hearing
,
by
the
school-master
or
the
*NL*
school-friend
who
,
at
that
particular
time
,
seemed
to
me
to
be
*NL*
entrusted
with
the
secret
of
Truth
and
Beauty
,
things
half-felt
by
me
,
*NL*
half-incomprehensible
,
the
full
understanding
of
which
was
the
vague
but
*NL*
permanent
object
of
my
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
to
this
central
belief
,
which
,
while
I
was
reading
,
would
be
*NL*
constantly
a
motion
from
my
inner
self
to
the
outer
world
,
towards
the
*NL*
discovery
of
Truth
,
came
the
emotions
aroused
in
me
by
the
action
in
*NL*
which
I
would
be
taking
part
,
for
these
afternoons
were
crammed
with
*NL*
more
dramatic
and
sensational
events
than
occur
,
often
,
in
a
whole
*NL*
lifetime
.
These
were
the
events
which
took
place
in
the
book
I
was
*NL*
reading
.
It
is
true
that
the
people
concerned
in
them
were
not
what
*NL*
Françoise
would
have
called
`
real
people
.
'
But
none
of
the
feelings
*NL*
which
the
joys
or
misfortunes
of
a
`
real
'
person
awaken
in
us
can
be
*NL*
awakened
except
through
a
mental
picture
of
those
joys
or
misfortunes
;
*NL*
and
the
ingenuity
of
the
first
novelist
lay
in
his
understanding
*NL*
that
,
as
the
picture
was
the
one
essential
element
in
the
complicated
*NL*
structure
of
our
emotions
,
so
that
simplification
of
it
which
consisted
*NL*
in
the
suppression
,
pure
and
simple
,
of
`
real
'
people
would
be
a
decided
*NL*
improvement
.
A
`
real
'
person
,
profoundly
as
we
may
sympathise
with
him
,
*NL*
is
in
a
great
measure
perceptible
only
through
our
senses
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
he
remains
opaque
,
offers
a
dead
weight
which
our
sensibilities
*NL*
have
not
the
strength
to
lift
.
If
some
misfortune
comes
to
him
,
it
is
*NL*
only
in
one
small
section
of
the
complete
idea
we
have
of
him
that
*NL*
we
are
capable
of
feeling
any
emotion
;
indeed
it
is
only
in
one
small
*NL*
section
of
the
complete
idea
he
has
of
himself
that
he
is
capable
of
*NL*
feeling
any
emotion
either
.
The
novelist
's
happy
discovery
was
to
think
*NL*
of
substituting
for
those
opaque
sections
,
impenetrable
by
the
human
*NL*
spirit
,
their
equivalent
in
immaterial
sections
,
things
,
that
is
,
which
*NL*
the
spirit
can
assimilate
to
itself
.
After
which
it
matters
not
that
the
*NL*
actions
,
the
feelings
of
this
new
order
of
creatures
appear
to
us
in
*NL*
the
guise
of
truth
,
since
we
have
made
them
our
own
,
since
it
is
in
*NL*
ourselves
that
they
are
happening
,
that
they
are
holding
in
thrall
,
*NL*
while
we
turn
over
,
feverishly
,
the
pages
of
the
book
,
our
quickened
*NL*
breath
and
staring
eyes
.
And
once
the
novelist
has
brought
us
to
that
*NL*
state
,
in
which
,
as
in
all
purely
mental
states
,
every
emotion
is
*NL*
multiplied
ten-fold
,
into
which
his
book
comes
to
disturb
us
as
might
*NL*
a
dream
,
but
a
dream
more
lucid
,
and
of
a
more
lasting
impression
than
*NL*
those
which
come
to
us
in
sleep
;
why
,
then
,
for
the
space
of
an
hour
*NL*
he
sets
free
within
us
all
the
joys
and
sorrows
in
the
world
,
a
few
of
*NL*
which
,
only
,
we
should
have
to
spend
years
of
our
actual
life
in
getting
*NL*
to
know
,
and
the
keenest
,
the
most
intense
of
which
would
never
have
*NL*
been
revealed
to
us
because
the
slow
course
of
their
development
stops
*NL*
our
perception
of
them
.
It
is
the
same
in
life
;
the
heart
changes
,
and
*NL*
that
is
our
worst
misfortune
;
but
we
learn
of
it
only
from
reading
or
by
*NL*
imagination
;
for
in
reality
its
alteration
,
like
that
of
certain
natural
*NL*
phenomena
,
is
so
gradual
that
,
even
if
we
are
able
to
distinguish
,
*NL*
successively
,
each
of
its
different
states
,
we
are
still
spared
the
*NL*
actual
sensation
of
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
to
,
but
distinctly
less
intimate
a
part
of
myself
than
this
human
*NL*
element
,
would
come
the
view
,
more
or
less
projected
before
my
eyes
,
*NL*
of
the
country
in
which
the
action
of
the
story
was
taking
place
,
which
*NL*
made
a
far
stronger
impression
on
my
mind
than
the
other
,
the
actual
*NL*
landscape
which
would
meet
my
eyes
when
I
raised
them
from
my
book
.
In
*NL*
this
way
,
for
two
consecutive
summers
I
used
to
sit
in
the
heat
of
our
*NL*
Combray
garden
,
sick
with
a
longing
inspired
by
the
book
I
was
then
*NL*
reading
for
a
land
of
mountains
and
rivers
,
where
I
could
see
an
endless
*NL*
vista
of
sawmills
,
where
beneath
the
limpid
currents
fragments
of
*NL*
wood
lay
mouldering
in
beds
of
watercress
;
and
nearby
,
rambling
and
*NL*
clustering
along
low
walls
,
purple
flowers
and
red
.
And
since
there
was
*NL*
always
lurking
in
my
mind
the
dream
of
a
woman
who
would
enrich
me
with
*NL*
her
love
,
that
dream
in
those
two
summers
used
to
be
quickened
with
the
*NL*
freshness
and
coolness
of
running
water
;
and
whoever
she
might
be
,
the
*NL*
woman
whose
image
I
called
to
mind
,
purple
flowers
and
red
would
at
once
*NL*
spring
up
on
either
side
of
her
like
complementary
colours
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
only
because
an
image
of
which
we
dream
remains
for
ever
*NL*
distinguished
,
is
adorned
and
enriched
by
the
association
of
colours
not
*NL*
its
own
which
may
happen
to
surround
it
in
our
mental
picture
;
for
the
*NL*
scenes
in
the
books
I
read
were
to
me
not
merely
scenery
more
vividly
*NL*
portrayed
by
my
imagination
than
any
which
Combray
could
spread
before
*NL*
my
eyes
but
otherwise
of
the
same
kind
.
Because
of
the
selection
that
*NL*
the
author
had
made
of
them
,
because
of
the
spirit
of
faith
in
which
*NL*
my
mind
would
exceed
and
anticipate
his
printed
word
,
as
it
might
*NL*
be
interpreting
a
revelation
,
these
scenes
used
to
give
me
the
*NL*
impression
--
one
which
I
hardly
ever
derived
from
any
place
in
which
*NL*
I
might
happen
to
be
,
and
never
from
our
garden
,
that
undistinguished
*NL*
product
of
the
strictly
conventional
fantasy
of
the
gardener
whom
my
*NL*
grandmother
so
despised
--
of
their
being
actually
part
of
Nature
herself
,
*NL*
and
worthy
to
be
studied
and
explored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
my
parents
allowed
me
,
when
I
read
a
book
,
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
*NL*
country
it
described
,
I
should
have
felt
that
I
was
making
an
enormous
*NL*
advance
towards
the
ultimate
conquest
of
truth
.
For
even
if
we
have
*NL*
the
sensation
of
being
always
enveloped
in
,
surrounded
by
our
own
soul
,
*NL*
still
it
does
not
seem
a
fixed
and
immovable
prison
;
rather
do
we
seem
*NL*
to
be
borne
away
with
it
,
and
perpetually
struggling
to
pass
beyond
it
,
*NL*
to
break
out
into
the
world
,
with
a
perpetual
discouragement
as
we
hear
*NL*
endlessly
,
all
around
us
,
that
unvarying
sound
which
is
no
echo
from
*NL*
without
,
but
the
resonance
of
a
vibration
from
within
.
We
try
to
*NL*
discover
in
things
,
endeared
to
us
on
that
account
,
the
spiritual
*NL*
glamour
which
we
ourselves
have
cast
upon
them
;
we
are
disillusioned
,
*NL*
and
learn
that
they
are
in
themselves
barren
and
devoid
of
the
charm
*NL*
which
they
owed
,
in
our
minds
,
to
the
association
of
certain
ideas
;
*NL*
sometimes
we
mobilise
all
our
spiritual
forces
in
a
glittering
array
so
*NL*
as
to
influence
and
subjugate
other
human
beings
who
,
as
we
very
well
*NL*
know
,
are
situated
outside
ourselves
,
where
we
can
never
reach
them
.
And
*NL*
so
,
if
I
always
imagined
the
woman
I
loved
as
in
a
setting
of
whatever
*NL*
places
I
most
longed
,
at
the
time
,
to
visit
;
if
in
my
secret
longings
*NL*
it
was
she
who
attracted
me
to
them
,
who
opened
to
me
the
gate
of
an
*NL*
unknown
world
,
that
was
not
by
the
mere
hazard
of
a
simple
association
*NL*
of
thoughts
;
no
,
it
was
because
my
dreams
of
travel
and
of
love
were
*NL*
only
moments
--
which
I
isolate
artificially
to-day
as
though
I
*NL*
were
cutting
sections
,
at
different
heights
,
in
a
jet
of
water
,
*NL*
rainbow-flashing
but
seemingly
without
flow
or
motion
--
were
only
drops
*NL*
in
a
single
,
undeviating
,
irresistible
outrush
of
all
the
forces
of
my
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
as
I
continue
to
trace
the
outward
course
of
these
impressions
*NL*
from
their
close-packed
intimate
source
in
my
consciousness
,
and
*NL*
before
I
come
to
the
horizon
of
reality
which
envelops
them
,
I
discover
*NL*
pleasures
of
another
kind
,
those
of
being
comfortably
seated
,
of
tasting
*NL*
the
good
scent
on
the
air
,
of
not
being
disturbed
by
any
visitor
;
and
,
*NL*
when
an
hour
chimed
from
the
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
,
of
watching
what
*NL*
was
already
spent
of
the
afternoon
fall
drop
by
drop
until
I
heard
the
*NL*
last
stroke
which
enabled
me
to
add
up
the
total
sum
,
after
which
the
*NL*
silence
that
followed
seemed
to
herald
the
beginning
,
in
the
blue
sky
*NL*
above
me
,
of
that
long
part
of
the
day
still
allowed
me
for
reading
,
*NL*
until
the
good
dinner
which
Françoise
was
even
now
preparing
should
come
*NL*
to
strengthen
and
refresh
me
after
the
strenuous
pursuit
of
its
hero
*NL*
through
the
pages
of
my
book
.
And
,
as
each
hour
struck
,
it
would
seem
to
*NL*
me
that
a
few
seconds
only
had
passed
since
the
hour
before
;
the
latest
*NL*
would
inscribe
itself
,
close
to
its
predecessor
,
on
the
sky
's
surface
,
*NL*
and
I
would
be
unable
to
believe
that
sixty
minutes
could
be
squeezed
*NL*
into
the
tiny
arc
of
blue
which
was
comprised
between
their
two
golden
*NL*
figures
.
Sometimes
it
would
even
happen
that
this
precocious
hour
would
*NL*
sound
two
strokes
more
than
the
last
;
there
must
then
have
been
an
hour
*NL*
which
I
had
not
heard
strike
;
something
which
had
taken
place
had
not
*NL*
taken
place
for
me
;
the
fascination
of
my
book
,
a
magic
as
potent
as
the
*NL*
deepest
slumber
,
had
stopped
my
enchanted
ears
and
had
obliterated
*NL*
the
sound
of
that
golden
bell
from
the
azure
surface
of
the
enveloping
*NL*
silence
.
Sweet
Sunday
afternoons
beneath
the
chestnut-tree
in
our
*NL*
Combray
garden
,
from
which
I
was
careful
to
eliminate
every
commonplace
*NL*
incident
of
my
actual
life
,
replacing
them
by
a
career
of
strange
*NL*
adventures
and
ambitions
in
a
land
watered
by
living
streams
,
you
still
*NL*
recall
those
adventures
and
ambitions
to
my
mind
when
I
think
of
you
,
*NL*
and
you
embody
and
preserve
them
by
virtue
of
having
little
by
little
*NL*
drawn
round
and
enclosed
them
-LRB-
while
I
went
on
with
my
book
and
the
heat
*NL*
of
the
day
declined
-RRB-
in
the
gradual
crystallisation
,
slowly
altering
*NL*
in
form
and
dappled
with
a
pattern
of
chestnut-leaves
,
of
your
silent
,
*NL*
sonorous
,
fragrant
,
limpid
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
I
would
be
torn
from
my
book
,
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
by
the
gardener
's
daughter
,
who
came
running
like
a
mad
thing
,
*NL*
overturning
an
orange-tree
in
its
tub
,
cutting
a
finger
,
breaking
a
*NL*
tooth
,
and
screaming
out
``
They
're
coming
,
they
're
coming
!
''
so
that
*NL*
Françoise
and
I
should
run
too
and
not
miss
anything
of
the
show
.
That
*NL*
was
on
days
when
the
cavalry
stationed
in
Combray
went
out
for
some
*NL*
military
exercise
,
going
as
a
rule
by
the
Rue
Sainte-Hildegarde
.
While
*NL*
our
servants
,
sitting
in
a
row
on
their
chairs
outside
the
garden
*NL*
railings
,
stared
at
the
people
of
Combray
taking
their
Sunday
walks
and
*NL*
were
stared
at
in
return
,
the
gardener
's
daughter
,
through
the
gap
which
*NL*
there
was
between
two
houses
far
away
in
the
Avenue
de
la
Gare
,
would
*NL*
have
spied
the
glitter
of
helmets
.
The
servants
then
hurried
in
*NL*
with
their
chairs
,
for
when
the
troopers
filed
through
the
Rue
*NL*
Sainte-Hildegarde
they
filled
it
from
side
to
side
,
and
their
jostling
*NL*
horses
scraped
against
the
walls
of
the
houses
,
covering
and
drowning
*NL*
the
pavements
like
banks
which
present
too
narrow
a
channel
to
a
river
*NL*
in
flood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
children
,
''
Françoise
would
exclaim
,
in
tears
almost
before
she
*NL*
had
reached
the
railings
;
``
poor
boys
,
to
be
mown
down
like
grass
in
a
*NL*
meadow
.
It
's
just
shocking
to
think
of
,
''
she
would
go
on
,
laying
a
hand
*NL*
over
her
heart
,
where
presumably
she
had
felt
the
shock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
sight
,
is
n't
it
,
Mme.
Françoise
,
all
these
young
fellows
not
*NL*
caring
two
straws
for
their
lives
?
''
the
gardener
would
ask
,
just
to
*NL*
`
draw
'
her
.
And
he
would
not
have
spoken
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
caring
for
their
lives
,
is
it
?
Why
,
what
in
the
world
is
there
that
*NL*
we
should
care
for
if
it
's
not
our
lives
,
the
only
gift
the
Lord
never
*NL*
offers
us
a
second
time
?
Oh
dear
,
oh
dear
;
you
're
right
all
the
same
;
*NL*
it
's
quite
true
,
they
do
n't
care
!
I
can
remember
them
in
'
70
;
in
those
*NL*
wretched
wars
they
've
no
fear
of
death
left
in
them
;
they
're
nothing
*NL*
more
nor
less
than
madmen
;
and
then
they
are
n't
worth
the
price
of
a
*NL*
rope
to
hang
them
with
;
they
're
not
men
any
more
,
they
're
lions
.
''
For
*NL*
by
her
way
of
thinking
,
to
compare
a
man
with
a
lion
,
which
she
used
to
*NL*
pronounce
`
lie-on
,
'
was
not
at
all
complimentary
to
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rue
Sainte-Hildegarde
turned
too
sharply
for
us
to
be
able
to
see
*NL*
people
approaching
at
any
distance
,
and
it
was
only
through
the
gap
*NL*
between
those
two
houses
in
the
Avenue
de
la
Gare
that
we
could
still
*NL*
make
out
fresh
helmets
racing
along
towards
us
,
and
flashing
in
the
*NL*
sunlight
.
The
gardener
wanted
to
know
whether
there
were
still
many
to
*NL*
come
,
and
he
was
thirsty
besides
,
with
the
sun
beating
down
upon
his
*NL*
head
.
So
then
,
suddenly
,
his
daughter
would
leap
out
,
as
though
from
*NL*
a
beleaguered
city
,
would
make
a
sortie
,
turn
the
street
corner
,
and
,
*NL*
having
risked
her
life
a
hundred
times
over
,
reappear
and
bring
us
,
*NL*
with
a
jug
of
liquorice-water
,
the
news
that
there
were
still
at
least
*NL*
a
thousand
of
them
,
pouring
along
without
a
break
from
the
direction
*NL*
of
Thiberzy
and
Méséglise
.
Françoise
and
the
gardener
,
having
`
made
up
'
*NL*
their
difference
,
would
discuss
the
line
to
be
followed
in
case
of
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
,
Françoise
,
''
he
would
say
.
``
Revolution
would
be
better
,
*NL*
because
then
no
one
would
need
to
join
in
unless
he
liked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
can
see
that
,
certainly
;
it
's
more
straightforward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gardener
believed
that
,
as
soon
as
war
was
declared
,
they
would
stop
*NL*
all
the
railways
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
to
be
sure
;
so
that
we
sha
'n'
t
get
away
,
''
said
Françoise
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
gardener
would
assent
,
with
``
Ay
,
they
're
the
cunning
ones
,
''
for
*NL*
he
would
not
allow
that
war
was
anything
but
a
kind
of
trick
which
the
*NL*
state
attempted
to
play
on
the
people
,
or
that
there
was
a
man
in
the
*NL*
world
who
would
not
run
away
from
it
if
he
had
the
chance
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Françoise
would
hasten
back
to
my
aunt
,
and
I
would
return
to
my
*NL*
book
,
and
the
servants
would
take
their
places
again
outside
the
gate
to
*NL*
watch
the
dust
settle
on
the
pavement
,
and
the
excitement
caused
by
the
*NL*
passage
of
the
soldiers
subside
.
Long
after
order
had
been
restored
,
*NL*
an
abnormal
tide
of
humanity
would
continue
to
darken
the
streets
of
*NL*
Cormbray
.
And
in
front
of
every
house
,
even
of
those
where
it
was
not
,
*NL*
as
a
rule
,
`
done
,
'
the
servants
,
and
sometimes
even
the
masters
would
*NL*
sit
and
stare
,
festooning
their
doorsteps
with
a
dark
,
irregular
fringe
,
*NL*
like
the
border
of
shells
and
sea-weed
which
a
stronger
tide
than
usual
*NL*
leaves
on
the
beach
,
as
though
trimming
it
with
embroidered
crape
,
when
*NL*
the
sea
itself
has
retreated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Except
on
such
days
as
these
,
however
,
I
would
as
a
rule
be
left
to
read
*NL*
in
peace
.
But
the
interruption
which
a
visit
from
Swann
once
made
,
and
*NL*
the
commentary
which
he
then
supplied
to
the
course
of
my
reading
,
*NL*
which
had
brought
me
to
the
work
of
an
author
quite
new
to
me
,
called
*NL*
Bergotte
,
had
this
definite
result
that
for
a
long
time
afterwards
*NL*
it
was
not
against
a
wall
gay
with
spikes
of
purple
blossom
,
but
on
a
*NL*
wholly
different
background
,
the
porch
of
a
gothic
cathedral
,
that
I
*NL*
would
see
outlined
the
figure
of
one
of
the
women
of
whom
I
dreamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
heard
Bergotte
spoken
of
,
for
the
first
time
,
by
a
friend
older
*NL*
than
myself
,
for
whom
I
had
a
strong
admiration
,
a
precious
youth
of
the
*NL*
name
of
Bloch
.
Hearing
me
confess
my
love
of
the
_
Nuit
d'Octobre
_
,
he
*NL*
had
burst
out
in
a
bray
of
laughter
,
like
a
bugle-call
,
and
told
me
,
*NL*
by
way
of
warning
:
``
You
must
conquer
your
vile
taste
for
A.
de
Musset
,
*NL*
Esquire
.
He
is
a
bad
egg
,
one
of
the
very
worst
,
a
pretty
detestable
*NL*
specimen
.
I
am
bound
to
admit
,
natheless
,
''
he
added
graciously
,
``
that
*NL*
he
,
and
even
the
man
Racine
,
did
,
each
of
them
,
once
in
his
life
,
*NL*
compose
a
line
which
is
not
only
fairly
rhythmical
,
but
has
also
what
is
*NL*
in
my
eyes
the
supreme
merit
of
meaning
absolutely
nothing
.
One
is
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
La
blanche
Oloossone
et
la
blanche
Camire
_
,
*NL*
*NL*
and
the
other
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
_
La
fille
de
Minos
et
de
Pasiphaë
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
submitted
to
my
judgment
,
as
evidence
for
the
defence
of
the
*NL*
two
runagates
,
in
an
article
by
my
very
dear
master
Father
Lecomte
,
who
*NL*
is
found
pleasing
in
the
sight
of
the
immortal
gods
.
By
which
token
,
*NL*
here
is
a
book
which
I
have
not
the
time
,
just
now
,
to
read
,
a
book
*NL*
recommended
,
it
would
seem
,
by
that
colossal
fellow
.
He
regards
,
or
so
*NL*
they
tell
me
,
its
author
,
one
Bergotte
,
Esquire
,
as
a
subtle
scribe
,
*NL*
more
subtle
,
indeed
,
than
any
beast
of
the
field
;
and
,
albeit
he
*NL*
exhibits
on
occasion
a
critical
pacifism
,
a
tenderness
in
suffering
*NL*
fools
,
for
which
it
is
impossible
to
account
,
and
hard
to
make
*NL*
allowance
,
still
his
word
has
weight
with
me
as
it
were
the
Delphic
*NL*
Oracle
.
Read
you
then
this
lyrical
prose
,
and
,
if
the
Titanic
*NL*
master-builder
of
rhythm
who
composed
_
Bhagavat
_
and
the
_
Lévrier
de
*NL*
Magnus
_
speaks
not
falsely
,
then
,
by
Apollo
,
you
may
taste
,
even
you
,
my
*NL*
master
,
the
ambrosial
joys
of
Olympus
.
''
It
was
in
an
ostensible
vein
of
*NL*
sarcasm
that
he
had
asked
me
to
call
him
,
and
that
he
himself
called
me
,
*NL*
``
my
master
.
''
But
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
we
each
derived
a
certain
amount
*NL*
of
satisfaction
from
the
mannerism
,
being
still
at
the
age
in
which
one
*NL*
believes
that
one
gives
a
thing
real
existence
by
giving
it
a
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
I
was
not
able
to
set
at
rest
,
by
further
talks
with
*NL*
Bloch
,
in
which
I
might
have
insisted
upon
an
explanation
,
the
doubts
*NL*
he
had
engendered
in
me
when
he
told
me
that
fine
lines
of
poetry
-LRB-
from
*NL*
which
I
,
if
you
please
,
expected
nothing
less
than
the
revelation
of
*NL*
truth
itself
-RRB-
were
all
the
finer
if
they
meant
absolutely
nothing
.
For
,
*NL*
as
it
happened
,
Bloch
was
not
invited
to
the
house
again
.
At
first
,
he
*NL*
had
been
well
received
there
.
It
is
true
that
my
grandfather
made
out
*NL*
that
,
whenever
I
formed
a
strong
attachment
to
any
one
of
my
friends
and
*NL*
brought
him
home
with
me
,
that
friend
was
invariably
a
Jew
;
to
which
he
*NL*
would
not
have
objected
on
principle
--
indeed
his
own
friend
Swann
was
*NL*
of
Jewish
extraction
--
had
he
not
found
that
the
Jews
whom
I
chose
as
*NL*
friends
were
not
usually
of
the
best
type
.
And
so
I
was
hardly
ever
able
*NL*
to
bring
a
new
friend
home
without
my
grandfather
's
humming
the
``
O
,
*NL*
God
of
our
fathers
''
from
_
La
Juive
_
,
or
else
``
Israel
,
break
thy
chain
,
''
*NL*
singing
the
tune
alone
,
of
course
,
to
an
``
um-ti-tum-ti-tum
,
tra-la
''
;
but
*NL*
I
used
to
be
afraid
of
my
friend
's
recognising
the
sound
,
and
so
being
*NL*
able
to
reconstruct
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
seeing
them
,
merely
on
hearing
their
names
,
about
which
,
as
often
*NL*
as
not
,
there
was
nothing
particularly
Hebraic
,
he
would
divine
not
only
*NL*
the
Jewish
origin
of
such
of
my
friends
as
might
indeed
be
of
the
chosen
*NL*
people
,
but
even
some
dark
secret
which
was
hidden
in
their
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
they
call
your
friend
who
is
coming
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dumont
,
grandpapa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dumont
!
Oh
,
I
'm
frightened
of
Dumont
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
would
sing
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Archers
,
be
on
your
guard
!
*NL*
Watch
without
rest
,
without
sound
,
*NL*
*NL*
and
then
,
after
a
few
adroit
questions
on
points
of
detail
,
he
would
*NL*
call
out
``
On
guard
!
on
guard
,
''
or
,
if
it
were
the
victim
himself
who
*NL*
had
already
arrived
,
and
had
been
obliged
,
unconsciously
,
by
my
*NL*
grandfather
's
subtle
examination
,
to
admit
his
origin
,
then
my
*NL*
grandfather
,
to
shew
us
that
he
had
no
longer
any
doubts
,
would
merely
*NL*
look
at
us
,
humming
almost
inaudibly
the
air
of
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
!
do
you
hither
guide
the
feet
*NL*
Of
this
timid
Israelite
?
*NL*
*NL*
or
of
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sweet
vale
of
Hebron
,
dear
paternal
fields
,
*NL*
*NL*
or
,
perhaps
,
of
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
I
am
of
the
chosen
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
little
eccentricities
on
my
grandfather
's
part
implied
no
ill-will
*NL*
whatsoever
towards
my
friends
.
But
Bloch
had
displeased
my
family
for
*NL*
other
reasons
.
He
had
begun
by
annoying
my
father
,
who
,
seeing
him
come
*NL*
in
with
wet
clothes
,
had
asked
him
with
keen
interest
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
M.
Bloch
,
is
there
a
change
in
the
weather
;
has
it
been
raining
?
I
*NL*
ca
n't
understand
it
;
the
barometer
has
been
`
set
fair
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
drew
from
Bloch
nothing
more
instructive
than
``
Sir
,
I
am
*NL*
absolutely
incapable
of
telling
you
whether
it
has
rained
.
I
live
so
*NL*
resolutely
apart
from
physical
contingencies
that
my
senses
no
longer
*NL*
trouble
to
inform
me
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
boy
,
''
said
my
father
after
Bloch
had
gone
,
``
your
friend
is
out
*NL*
of
his
mind
.
Why
,
he
could
n't
even
tell
me
what
the
weather
was
like
.
As
*NL*
if
there
could
be
anything
more
interesting
!
He
is
an
imbecile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Next
,
Bloch
had
displeased
my
grandmother
because
,
after
luncheon
,
when
*NL*
she
complained
of
not
feeling
very
well
,
he
had
stifled
a
sob
and
wiped
*NL*
the
tears
from
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
imagine
that
he
is
sincere
,
''
she
observed
to
me
.
``
Why
he
*NL*
does
n't
know
me
.
Unless
he
's
mad
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
finally
he
had
upset
the
whole
household
when
he
arrived
an
hour
*NL*
and
a
half
late
for
luncheon
and
covered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
,
and
*NL*
made
not
the
least
apology
,
saying
merely
:
``
I
never
allow
myself
to
be
*NL*
influenced
in
the
smallest
degree
either
by
atmospheric
disturbances
or
*NL*
by
the
arbitrary
divisions
of
what
is
known
as
Time
.
I
would
willingly
*NL*
reintroduce
to
society
the
opium
pipe
of
China
or
the
Malayan
kriss
,
but
*NL*
I
am
wholly
and
entirely
without
instruction
in
those
infinitely
more
*NL*
pernicious
-LRB-
besides
being
quite
bleakly
bourgeois
-RRB-
implements
,
the
*NL*
umbrella
and
the
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
this
he
would
still
have
been
received
at
Combray
.
He
*NL*
was
,
of
course
,
hardly
the
friend
my
parents
would
have
chosen
for
*NL*
me
;
they
had
,
in
the
end
,
decided
that
the
tears
which
he
had
shed
on
*NL*
hearing
of
my
grandmother
's
illness
were
genuine
enough
;
but
they
*NL*
knew
,
either
instinctively
or
from
their
own
experience
,
that
our
early
*NL*
impulsive
emotions
have
but
little
influence
over
our
later
actions
and
*NL*
the
conduct
of
our
lives
;
and
that
regard
for
moral
obligations
,
loyalty
*NL*
to
our
friends
,
patience
in
finishing
our
work
,
obedience
to
a
rule
*NL*
of
life
,
have
a
surer
foundation
in
habits
solidly
formed
and
blindly
*NL*
followed
than
in
these
momentary
transports
,
ardent
but
sterile
.
They
*NL*
would
have
preferred
to
Bloch
,
as
companions
for
myself
,
boys
who
would
*NL*
have
given
me
no
more
than
it
is
proper
,
by
all
the
laws
of
middle-class
*NL*
morality
,
for
boys
to
give
one
another
,
who
would
not
unexpectedly
*NL*
send
me
a
basket
of
fruit
because
they
happened
,
that
morning
,
to
have
*NL*
thought
of
me
with
affection
,
but
who
,
since
they
were
incapable
of
*NL*
inclining
in
my
favour
,
by
any
single
impulse
of
their
imagination
and
*NL*
emotions
,
the
exact
balance
of
the
duties
and
claims
of
friendship
,
were
*NL*
as
incapable
of
loading
the
scales
to
my
prejudice
.
Even
the
injuries
*NL*
we
do
them
will
not
easily
divert
from
the
path
of
their
duty
towards
us
*NL*
those
conventional
natures
of
which
my
great-aunt
furnished
a
type
:
who
,
*NL*
after
quarrelling
for
years
with
a
niece
,
to
whom
she
never
spoke
again
,
*NL*
yet
made
no
change
in
the
will
in
which
she
had
left
that
niece
the
*NL*
whole
of
her
fortune
,
because
she
was
her
next-of-kin
,
and
it
was
the
*NL*
`
proper
thing
'
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
fond
of
Bloch
;
my
parents
wished
me
to
be
happy
;
and
the
*NL*
insoluble
problems
which
I
set
myself
on
such
texts
as
the
`
absolutely
*NL*
meaningless
'
beauty
of
_
La
fille
de
Minos
et
de
Pasiphaë
_
tired
me
more
*NL*
and
made
me
more
unwell
than
I
should
have
been
after
further
talks
with
*NL*
him
,
unwholesome
as
those
talks
might
seem
to
my
mother
's
mind
.
And
he
*NL*
would
still
have
been
received
at
Combray
but
for
one
thing
.
That
same
*NL*
night
,
after
dinner
,
having
informed
me
-LRB-
a
piece
of
news
which
had
a
*NL*
great
influence
on
my
later
life
,
making
it
happier
at
one
time
and
then
*NL*
more
unhappy
-RRB-
that
no
woman
ever
thought
of
anything
but
love
,
and
that
*NL*
there
was
not
one
of
them
whose
resistance
a
man
could
not
overcome
,
*NL*
he
had
gone
on
to
assure
me
that
he
had
heard
it
said
on
unimpeachable
*NL*
authority
that
my
great-aunt
herself
had
led
a
`
gay
'
life
in
her
younger
*NL*
days
,
and
had
been
notoriously
`
kept
.
'
I
could
not
refrain
from
passing
*NL*
on
so
important
a
piece
of
information
to
my
parents
;
the
next
time
*NL*
Bloch
called
he
was
not
admitted
,
and
afterwards
,
when
I
met
him
in
the
*NL*
street
,
he
greeted
me
with
extreme
coldness
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
matter
of
Bergotte
he
had
spoken
truly
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
few
days
,
like
a
tune
which
will
be
running
in
one
's
head
*NL*
and
maddening
one
soon
enough
,
but
of
which
one
has
not
for
the
moment
*NL*
`
got
hold
,
'
the
things
I
was
to
love
so
passionately
in
Bergotte
's
style
*NL*
had
not
yet
caught
my
eye
.
I
could
not
,
it
is
true
,
lay
down
the
novel
*NL*
of
his
which
I
was
reading
,
but
I
fancied
that
I
was
interested
in
the
*NL*
story
alone
,
as
in
the
first
dawn
of
love
,
when
we
go
every
day
to
meet
*NL*
a
woman
at
some
party
or
entertainment
by
the
charm
of
which
we
imagine
*NL*
it
is
that
we
are
attracted
.
Then
I
observed
the
rare
,
almost
archaic
*NL*
phrases
which
he
liked
to
employ
at
certain
points
,
where
a
hidden
flow
*NL*
of
harmony
,
a
prelude
contained
and
concealed
in
the
work
itself
would
*NL*
animate
and
elevate
his
style
;
and
it
was
at
such
points
as
these
,
*NL*
too
,
that
he
would
begin
to
speak
of
the
``
vain
dream
of
life
,
''
of
the
*NL*
``
inexhaustible
torrent
of
fair
forms
,
''
of
the
``
sterile
,
splendid
torture
*NL*
of
understanding
and
loving
,
''
of
the
``
moving
effigies
which
ennoble
for
*NL*
all
time
the
charming
and
venerable
fronts
of
our
cathedrals
''
;
that
he
*NL*
would
express
a
whole
system
of
philosophy
,
new
to
me
,
by
the
use
of
*NL*
marvellous
imagery
,
to
the
inspiration
of
which
I
would
naturally
have
*NL*
ascribed
that
sound
of
harping
which
began
to
chime
and
echo
in
my
ears
,
*NL*
an
accompaniment
to
which
that
imagery
added
something
ethereal
and
*NL*
sublime
.
One
of
these
passages
of
Bergotte
,
the
third
or
fourth
which
I
*NL*
had
detached
from
the
rest
,
filled
me
with
a
joy
to
which
the
meagre
joy
*NL*
I
had
tasted
in
the
first
passage
bore
no
comparison
,
a
joy
which
I
felt
*NL*
myself
to
have
experienced
in
some
innermost
chamber
of
my
soul
,
deep
,
*NL*
undivided
,
vast
,
from
which
all
obstructions
and
partitions
seemed
to
*NL*
have
been
swept
away
.
For
what
had
happened
was
that
,
while
I
recognised
*NL*
in
this
passage
the
same
taste
for
uncommon
phrases
,
the
same
bursts
*NL*
of
music
,
the
same
idealist
philosophy
which
had
been
present
in
the
*NL*
earlier
passages
without
my
having
taken
them
into
account
as
the
source
*NL*
of
my
pleasure
,
I
now
no
longer
had
the
impression
of
being
confronted
*NL*
by
a
particular
passage
in
one
of
Bergotte
's
works
,
which
traced
a
*NL*
purely
bi-dimensional
figure
in
outline
upon
the
surface
of
my
mind
,
but
*NL*
rather
of
the
`
ideal
passage
'
of
Bergotte
,
common
to
every
one
of
his
*NL*
books
,
and
to
which
all
the
earlier
,
similar
passages
,
now
becoming
*NL*
merged
in
it
,
had
added
a
kind
of
density
and
volume
,
by
which
my
own
*NL*
understanding
seemed
to
be
enlarged
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
by
no
means
Bergotte
's
sole
admirer
;
he
was
the
favourite
writer
*NL*
also
of
a
friend
of
my
mother
's
,
a
highly
literary
lady
;
while
Dr.
du
*NL*
Boulbon
had
kept
all
his
patients
waiting
until
he
finished
Bergotte
's
*NL*
latest
volume
;
and
it
was
from
his
consulting
room
,
and
from
a
house
in
*NL*
a
park
near
Combray
that
some
of
the
first
seeds
were
scattered
of
that
*NL*
taste
for
Bergotte
,
a
rare-growth
in
those
days
,
but
now
so
universally
*NL*
acclimatised
that
one
finds
it
flowering
everywhere
throughout
Europe
*NL*
and
America
,
and
even
in
the
tiniest
villages
,
rare
still
in
its
*NL*
refinement
,
but
in
that
alone
.
What
my
mother
's
friend
,
and
,
it
would
*NL*
seem
,
what
Dr.
du
Boulbon
liked
above
all
in
the
writings
of
Bergotte
*NL*
was
just
what
I
liked
,
the
same
flow
of
melody
,
the
same
old-fashioned
*NL*
phrases
,
and
certain
others
,
quite
simple
and
familiar
,
but
so
placed
by
*NL*
him
,
in
such
prominence
,
as
to
hint
at
a
particular
quality
of
taste
on
*NL*
his
part
;
and
also
,
in
the
sad
parts
of
his
books
,
a
sort
of
roughness
,
*NL*
a
tone
that
was
almost
harsh
.
And
he
himself
,
no
doubt
,
realised
that
*NL*
these
were
his
principal
attractions
.
For
in
his
later
books
,
if
he
had
*NL*
hit
upon
some
great
truth
,
or
upon
the
name
of
an
historic
cathedral
,
*NL*
he
would
break
off
his
narrative
,
and
in
an
invocation
,
an
apostrophe
,
a
*NL*
lengthy
prayer
,
would
give
a
free
outlet
to
that
effluence
which
,
in
*NL*
the
earlier
volumes
,
remained
buried
beneath
the
form
of
his
prose
,
*NL*
discernible
only
in
a
rippling
of
its
surface
,
and
perhaps
even
more
*NL*
delightful
,
more
harmonious
when
it
was
thus
veiled
from
the
eye
,
when
*NL*
the
reader
could
give
no
precise
indication
of
where
the
murmur
of
the
*NL*
current
began
,
or
of
where
it
died
away
.
These
passages
in
which
he
*NL*
delighted
were
our
favourites
also
.
For
my
own
part
I
knew
all
of
them
*NL*
by
heart
.
I
felt
even
disappointed
when
he
resumed
the
thread
of
his
*NL*
narrative
.
Whenever
he
spoke
of
something
whose
beauty
had
until
*NL*
then
remained
hidden
from
me
,
of
pine-forests
or
of
hailstorms
,
of
*NL*
_
Notre-Dame
de
Paris
_
,
of
_
Athalie
_
,
or
of
_
Phèdre
_
,
by
some
piece
*NL*
of
imagery
he
would
make
their
beauty
explode
and
drench
me
with
its
*NL*
essence
.
And
so
,
dimly
realising
that
the
universe
contained
innumerable
*NL*
elements
which
my
feeble
senses
would
be
powerless
to
discern
,
did
he
*NL*
not
bring
them
within
my
reach
,
I
wished
that
I
might
have
his
opinion
,
*NL*
some
metaphor
of
his
,
upon
everything
in
the
world
,
and
especially
upon
*NL*
such
things
as
I
might
have
an
opportunity
,
some
day
,
of
seeing
for
*NL*
myself
;
and
among
such
things
,
more
particularly
still
upon
some
of
the
*NL*
historic
buildings
of
France
,
upon
certain
views
of
the
sea
,
because
the
*NL*
emphasis
with
which
,
in
his
books
,
he
referred
to
these
shewed
that
he
*NL*
regarded
them
as
rich
in
significance
and
beauty
.
But
,
alas
,
upon
almost
*NL*
everything
in
the
world
his
opinion
was
unknown
to
me
.
I
had
no
doubt
*NL*
that
it
would
differ
entirely
from
my
own
,
since
his
came
down
from
an
*NL*
unknown
sphere
towards
which
I
was
striving
to
raise
myself
;
convinced
*NL*
that
my
thoughts
would
have
seemed
pure
foolishness
to
that
perfected
*NL*
spirit
,
I
had
so
completely
obliterated
them
all
that
,
if
I
happened
to
*NL*
find
in
one
of
his
books
something
which
had
already
occurred
to
my
own
*NL*
mind
,
my
heart
would
swell
with
gratitude
and
pride
as
though
some
deity
*NL*
had
,
in
his
infinite
bounty
,
restored
it
to
me
,
had
pronounced
it
to
be
*NL*
beautiful
and
right
.
It
happened
now
and
then
that
a
page
of
Bergotte
*NL*
would
express
precisely
those
ideas
which
I
used
often
at
night
,
when
*NL*
I
was
unable
to
sleep
,
to
write
to
my
grandmother
and
mother
,
and
so
*NL*
concisely
and
well
that
his
page
had
the
appearance
of
a
collection
of
*NL*
mottoes
for
me
to
set
at
the
head
of
my
letters
.
And
so
too
,
in
later
*NL*
years
,
when
I
began
to
compose
a
book
of
my
own
,
and
the
quality
of
some
*NL*
of
my
sentences
seemed
so
inadequate
that
I
could
not
make
up
my
mind
to
*NL*
go
on
with
the
undertaking
,
I
would
find
the
equivalent
of
my
sentences
*NL*
in
Bergotte
's
.
But
it
was
only
then
,
when
I
read
them
in
his
pages
,
*NL*
that
I
could
enjoy
them
;
when
it
was
I
myself
who
composed
them
,
in
*NL*
my
anxiety
that
they
should
exactly
reproduce
what
I
seemed
to
have
*NL*
detected
in
my
mind
,
and
in
my
fear
of
their
not
turning
out
`
true
to
*NL*
life
,
'
I
had
no
time
to
ask
myself
whether
what
I
was
writing
would
be
*NL*
pleasant
to
read
!
But
indeed
there
was
no
kind
of
language
,
no
kind
of
*NL*
ideas
which
I
really
liked
,
except
these
.
My
feverish
and
unsatisfactory
*NL*
attempts
were
themselves
a
token
of
my
love
,
a
love
which
brought
me
no
*NL*
pleasure
,
but
was
,
for
all
that
,
intense
and
deep
.
And
so
,
when
I
came
*NL*
suddenly
upon
similar
phrases
in
the
writings
of
another
,
that
is
to
say
*NL*
stripped
of
their
familiar
accompaniment
of
scruples
and
repressions
and
*NL*
self-tormentings
,
I
was
free
to
indulge
to
the
full
my
own
appetite
*NL*
for
such
things
,
just
as
a
cook
who
,
once
in
a
while
,
has
no
dinner
to
*NL*
prepare
for
other
people
,
can
then
find
time
to
gormandise
himself
.
And
*NL*
so
,
when
I
had
found
,
one
day
,
in
a
book
by
Bergotte
,
some
joke
about
*NL*
an
old
family
servant
,
to
which
his
solemn
and
magnificent
style
added
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
irony
,
but
which
was
in
principle
what
I
had
often
said
to
*NL*
my
grandmother
about
Françoise
,
and
when
,
another
time
,
I
had
discovered
*NL*
that
he
thought
not
unworthy
of
reflection
in
one
of
those
mirrors
of
*NL*
absolute
Truth
which
were
his
writings
,
a
remark
similar
to
one
which
I
*NL*
had
had
occasion
to
make
on
our
friend
M.
Legrandin
-LRB-
and
,
moreover
,
my
*NL*
remarks
on
Françoise
and
M.
Legrandin
were
among
those
which
I
would
*NL*
most
resolutely
have
sacrificed
for
Bergotte
's
sake
,
in
the
belief
*NL*
that
he
would
find
them
quite
without
interest
-RRB-
;
then
it
was
suddenly
*NL*
revealed
to
me
that
my
own
humble
existence
and
the
Realms
of
Truth
were
*NL*
less
widely
separated
than
I
had
supposed
,
that
at
certain
points
they
*NL*
were
actually
in
contact
;
and
in
my
new-found
confidence
and
joy
I
wept
*NL*
upon
his
printed
page
,
as
in
the
arms
of
a
long-lost
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
his
books
I
had
formed
an
impression
of
Bergotte
as
a
frail
and
*NL*
disappointed
old
man
,
who
had
lost
his
children
,
and
had
never
found
*NL*
any
consolation
.
And
so
I
would
read
,
or
rather
sing
his
sentences
in
*NL*
my
brain
,
with
rather
more
_
dolce
_
,
rather
more
_
lento
_
than
he
himself
*NL*
had
,
perhaps
,
intended
,
and
his
simplest
phrase
would
strike
my
ears
*NL*
with
something
peculiarly
gentle
and
loving
in
its
intonation
.
More
than
*NL*
anything
else
in
the
world
I
cherished
his
philosophy
,
and
had
pledged
*NL*
myself
to
it
in
lifelong
devotion
.
It
made
me
impatient
to
reach
the
*NL*
age
when
I
should
be
eligible
to
attend
the
class
at
school
called
*NL*
`
Philosophy
.
'
I
did
not
wish
to
learn
or
do
anything
else
there
,
but
*NL*
simply
to
exist
and
be
guided
entirely
by
the
mind
of
Bergotte
,
and
,
*NL*
if
I
had
been
told
then
that
the
metaphysicians
whom
I
was
actually
to
*NL*
follow
there
resembled
him
in
nothing
,
I
should
have
been
struck
down
by
*NL*
the
despair
a
young
lover
feels
who
has
sworn
lifelong
fidelity
,
when
*NL*
a
friend
speaks
to
him
of
the
other
mistresses
he
will
have
in
time
to
*NL*
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Sunday
,
while
I
was
reading
in
the
garden
,
I
was
interrupted
by
*NL*
Swann
,
who
had
come
to
call
upon
my
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
reading
?
May
I
look
?
Why
,
it
's
Bergotte
!
Who
has
been
*NL*
telling
you
about
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
Bloch
was
responsible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
that
boy
I
saw
here
once
,
who
looks
so
like
the
Bellini
*NL*
portrait
of
Mahomet
II
.
It
's
an
astonishing
likeness
;
he
has
the
same
*NL*
arched
eyebrows
and
hooked
nose
and
prominent
cheekbones
.
When
his
beard
*NL*
comes
he
'll
be
Mahomet
himself
.
Anyhow
he
has
good
taste
,
for
Bergotte
*NL*
is
a
charming
creature
.
''
And
seeing
how
much
I
seemed
to
admire
*NL*
Bergotte
,
Swann
,
who
never
spoke
at
all
about
the
people
he
knew
,
made
*NL*
an
exception
in
my
favour
and
said
:
``
I
know
him
well
;
if
you
would
like
*NL*
him
to
write
a
few
words
on
the
title-page
of
your
book
I
could
ask
him
*NL*
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
dared
not
accept
such
an
offer
,
but
bombarded
Swann
with
questions
*NL*
about
his
friend
.
``
Can
you
tell
me
,
please
,
who
is
his
favourite
actor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Actor
?
No
,
I
ca
n't
say
.
But
I
do
know
this
:
there
's
not
a
man
on
the
*NL*
stage
whom
he
thinks
equal
to
Berma
;
he
puts
her
above
everyone
.
Have
*NL*
you
seen
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
my
parents
do
not
allow
me
to
go
to
the
theatre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
pity
.
You
should
insist
.
Berma
in
_
Phèdre
_
,
in
the
_
Cid
_
;
*NL*
well
,
she
's
only
an
actress
,
if
you
like
,
but
you
know
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
very
much
in
the
`
hierarchy
'
of
the
arts
.
''
As
he
spoke
I
*NL*
noticed
,
what
had
often
struck
me
before
in
his
conversations
with
*NL*
my
grandmother
's
sisters
,
that
whenever
he
spoke
of
serious
matters
,
*NL*
whenever
he
used
an
expression
which
seemed
to
imply
a
definite
opinion
*NL*
upon
some
important
subject
,
he
would
take
care
to
isolate
,
to
sterilise
*NL*
it
by
using
a
special
intonation
,
mechanical
and
ironic
,
as
though
he
*NL*
had
put
the
phrase
or
word
between
inverted
commas
,
and
was
anxious
*NL*
to
disclaim
any
personal
responsibility
for
it
;
as
who
should
say
``
the
*NL*
`
hierarchy
,
'
do
n't
you
know
,
as
silly
people
call
it
.
''
But
then
,
if
it
*NL*
was
so
absurd
,
why
did
he
say
the
`
hierarchy
'
?
A
moment
later
he
went
*NL*
on
:
``
Her
acting
will
give
you
as
noble
an
inspiration
as
any
masterpiece
*NL*
of
art
in
the
world
,
as
--
oh
,
I
do
n't
know
--
''
and
he
began
to
laugh
,
*NL*
``
shall
we
say
the
Queens
of
Chartres
?
''
Until
then
I
had
supposed
that
*NL*
his
horror
of
having
to
give
a
serious
opinion
was
something
Parisian
*NL*
and
refined
,
in
contrast
to
the
provincial
dogmatism
of
my
grandmother
's
*NL*
sisters
;
and
I
had
imagined
also
that
it
was
characteristic
of
the
*NL*
mental
attitude
towards
life
of
the
circle
in
which
Swann
moved
,
*NL*
where
,
by
a
natural
reaction
from
the
`
lyrical
'
enthusiasms
of
earlier
*NL*
generations
,
an
excessive
importance
was
given
to
small
and
precise
*NL*
facts
,
formerly
regarded
as
vulgar
,
and
anything
in
the
nature
of
*NL*
`
phrase-making
'
was
banned
.
But
now
I
found
myself
slightly
shocked
*NL*
by
this
attitude
which
Swann
invariably
adopted
when
face
to
face
with
*NL*
generalities
.
He
appeared
unwilling
to
risk
even
having
an
opinion
,
and
*NL*
to
be
at
his
ease
only
when
he
could
furnish
,
with
meticulous
accuracy
,
*NL*
some
precise
but
unimportant
detail
.
But
in
so
doing
he
did
not
take
*NL*
into
account
that
even
here
he
was
giving
an
opinion
,
holding
a
brief
*NL*
-LRB-
as
they
say
-RRB-
for
something
,
that
the
accuracy
of
his
details
had
an
*NL*
importance
of
its
own
.
I
thought
again
of
the
dinner
that
night
,
when
I
*NL*
had
been
so
unhappy
because
Mamma
would
not
be
coming
up
to
my
room
,
and
*NL*
when
he
had
dismissed
the
balls
given
by
the
Princesse
de
Léon
as
being
*NL*
of
no
importance
.
And
yet
it
was
to
just
that
sort
of
amusement
that
he
*NL*
was
devoting
his
life
.
For
what
other
kind
of
existence
did
he
reserve
*NL*
the
duties
of
saying
in
all
seriousness
what
he
thought
about
things
,
*NL*
of
formulating
judgments
which
he
would
not
put
between
inverted
commas
;
*NL*
and
when
would
he
cease
to
give
himself
up
to
occupations
of
which
at
*NL*
the
same
,
time
he
made
out
that
they
were
absurd
?
I
noticed
,
too
,
in
the
*NL*
manner
in
which
Swann
spoke
to
me
of
Bergotte
,
something
which
,
to
do
*NL*
him
justice
,
was
not
peculiar
to
himself
,
but
was
shared
by
all
that
*NL*
writer
's
admirers
at
that
time
,
at
least
by
my
mother
's
friend
and
*NL*
by
Dr.
du
Boulbon
.
Like
Swann
,
they
would
say
of
Bergotte
:
``
He
has
a
*NL*
charming
mind
,
so
individual
,
he
has
a
way
of
his
own
of
saying
things
,
*NL*
which
is
a
little
far-fetched
,
but
so
pleasant
.
You
never
need
to
look
*NL*
for
his
name
on
the
title-page
,
you
can
tell
his
work
at
once
.
''
But
*NL*
none
of
them
had
yet
gone
so
far
as
to
say
``
He
is
a
great
writer
,
he
has
*NL*
great
talent
.
''
They
did
not
even
credit
him
with
talent
at
all
.
They
*NL*
did
not
speak
,
because
they
were
not
aware
of
it
.
We
are
very
slow
in
*NL*
recognising
in
the
peculiar
physiognomy
of
a
new
writer
the
type
which
*NL*
is
labelled
`
great
talent
'
in
our
museum
of
general
ideas
.
Simply
*NL*
because
that
physiognomy
is
new
and
strange
,
we
can
find
in
it
no
*NL*
resemblance
to
what
we
are
accustomed
to
call
talent
.
We
say
rather
*NL*
originality
,
charm
,
delicacy
,
strength
;
and
then
one
day
we
add
up
the
*NL*
sum
of
these
,
and
find
that
it
amounts
simply
to
talent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
there
any
books
in
which
Bergotte
has
written
about
Berma
?
''
I
asked
*NL*
M.
Swann
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
has
,
in
that
little
essay
on
Racine
,
but
it
must
be
out
of
*NL*
print
.
Still
,
there
has
perhaps
been
a
second
impression
.
I
will
find
*NL*
out
.
Anyhow
,
I
can
ask
Bergotte
himself
all
that
you
want
to
know
next
*NL*
time
he
comes
to
dine
with
us
.
He
never
misses
a
week
,
from
one
year
's
*NL*
end
to
another
.
He
is
my
daughter
's
greatest
friend
.
They
go
about
*NL*
together
,
and
look
at
old
towns
and
cathedrals
and
castles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
still
completely
ignorant
of
the
different
grades
in
the
social
*NL*
hierarchy
,
the
fact
that
my
father
found
it
impossible
for
us
to
see
*NL*
anything
of
Swann
's
wife
and
daughter
had
,
for
a
long
time
,
had
the
*NL*
contrary
effect
of
making
me
imagine
them
as
separated
from
us
by
an
*NL*
enormous
gulf
,
which
greatly
enhanced
their
dignity
and
importance
in
*NL*
my
eyes
.
I
was
sorry
that
my
mother
did
not
dye
her
hair
and
redden
her
*NL*
lips
,
as
I
had
heard
our
neighbour
,
Mme.
Sazerat
,
say
that
Mme.
Swann
*NL*
did
,
to
gratify
not
her
husband
but
M.
de
Charlus
;
and
I
felt
that
,
to
*NL*
her
,
we
must
be
an
object
of
scorn
,
which
distressed
me
particularly
on
*NL*
account
of
the
daughter
,
such
a
pretty
little
girl
,
as
I
had
heard
,
and
*NL*
one
of
whom
I
used
often
to
dream
,
always
imagining
her
with
the
same
*NL*
features
and
appearance
,
which
I
bestowed
upon
her
quite
arbitrarily
,
*NL*
but
with
a
charming
effect
.
But
from
this
afternoon
,
when
I
had
learned
*NL*
that
Mlle.
Swann
was
a
creature
living
in
such
rare
and
fortunate
*NL*
circumstances
,
bathed
,
as
in
her
natural
element
,
in
such
a
sea
of
*NL*
privilege
that
,
if
she
should
ask
her
parents
whether
anyone
were
coming
*NL*
to
dinner
,
she
would
be
answered
in
those
two
syllables
,
radiant
with
*NL*
celestial
light
,
would
hear
the
name
of
that
golden
guest
who
was
to
*NL*
her
no
more
than
an
old
friend
of
her
family
,
Bergotte
;
that
for
her
the
*NL*
intimate
conversation
at
table
,
corresponding
to
what
my
great-aunt
's
*NL*
conversation
was
for
me
,
would
be
the
words
of
Bergotte
upon
all
those
*NL*
subjects
which
he
had
not
been
able
to
take
up
in
his
writings
,
and
on
*NL*
which
I
would
fain
have
heard
him
utter
oracles
;
and
that
,
above
all
,
*NL*
when
she
went
to
visit
other
towns
,
he
would
be
walking
by
her
side
,
*NL*
unrecognised
and
glorious
,
like
the
gods
who
came
down
,
of
old
,
from
*NL*
heaven
to
dwell
among
mortal
men
:
then
I
realised
both
the
rare
worth
*NL*
of
a
creature
such
as
Mlle.
Swann
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
how
coarse
and
*NL*
ignorant
I
should
appear
to
her
;
and
I
felt
so
keenly
how
pleasant
and
*NL*
yet
how
impossible
it
would
be
for
me
to
become
her
friend
that
I
was
*NL*
filled
at
once
with
longing
and
with
despair
.
And
usually
,
from
this
*NL*
time
forth
,
when
I
thought
of
her
,
I
would
see
her
standing
before
the
*NL*
porch
of
a
cathedral
,
explaining
to
me
what
each
of
the
statues
meant
,
*NL*
and
,
with
a
smile
which
was
my
highest
commendation
,
presenting
me
,
as
*NL*
her
friend
,
to
Bergotte
.
And
invariably
the
charm
of
all
the
fancies
*NL*
which
the
thought
of
cathedrals
used
to
inspire
in
me
,
the
charm
of
the
*NL*
hills
and
valleys
of
the
He
de
France
and
of
the
plains
of
Normandy
,
*NL*
would
radiate
brightness
and
beauty
over
the
picture
I
had
formed
in
my
*NL*
mind
of
Mlle.
Swann
;
nothing
more
remained
but
to
know
and
to
love
*NL*
her
.
Once
we
believe
that
a
fellow-creature
has
a
share
in
some
unknown
*NL*
existence
to
which
that
creature
's
love
for
ourselves
can
win
us
*NL*
admission
,
that
is
,
of
all
the
preliminary
conditions
which
Love
exacts
,
*NL*
the
one
to
which
he
attaches
most
importance
,
the
one
which
makes
him
*NL*
generous
or
indifferent
as
to
the
rest
.
Even
those
women
who
pretend
*NL*
that
they
judge
a
man
by
his
exterior
only
,
see
in
that
exterior
an
*NL*
emanation
from
some
special
way
of
life
.
And
that
is
why
they
fall
*NL*
in
love
with
a
soldier
or
a
fireman
,
whose
uniform
makes
them
less
*NL*
particular
about
his
face
;
they
kiss
and
believe
that
beneath
the
*NL*
crushing
breastplate
there
beats
a
heart
different
from
the
rest
,
more
*NL*
gallant
,
more
adventurous
,
more
tender
;
and
so
it
is
that
a
young
king
*NL*
or
a
crown
prince
may
travel
in
foreign
countries
and
make
the
most
*NL*
gratifying
conquests
,
and
yet
lack
entirely
that
regular
and
classic
*NL*
profile
which
would
be
indispensable
,
I
dare
say
,
in
an
outside-broker
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
reading
in
the
garden
,
a
thing
my
great-aunt
would
never
*NL*
have
understood
my
doing
save
on
a
Sunday
,
that
being
the
day
on
which
*NL*
it
was
unlawful
to
indulge
in
any
serious
occupation
,
and
on
which
she
*NL*
herself
would
lay
aside
her
sewing
-LRB-
on
a
week-day
she
would
have
said
,
*NL*
``
How
you
can
go
on
amusing
yourself
with
a
book
;
it
is
n't
Sunday

*NL*
know

''
putting
into
the
word
`
amusing
'
an
implication
of
childishness
*NL*
and
waste
of
time
-RRB-
,
my
aunt
Léonie
would
be
gossiping
with
Françoise
*NL*
until
it
was
time
for
Eulalie
to
arrive
.
She
would
tell
her
that
she
had
*NL*
just
seen
Mme.
Goupil
go
by
``
without
an
umbrella
,
in
the
silk
dress
*NL*
she
had
made
for
her
the
other
day
at
Châteaudun
.
If
she
has
far
to
go
*NL*
before
vespers
,
she
may
get
it
properly
soaked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
''
-LRB-
which
meant
also
``
very
likely
not
''
-RRB-
was
the
answer
,
*NL*
for
Françoise
did
not
wish
definitely
to
exclude
the
possibility
of
a
*NL*
happier
alternative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
now
,
''
went
on
my
aunt
,
beating
her
brow
,
``
that
reminds
me
that
*NL*
I
never
heard
if
she
got
to
church
this
morning
before
the
Elevation

I
*NL*
must
remember
to
ask
Eulalie
...
Françoise
,
just
look
at
that
black
cloud
*NL*
behind
the
steeple
,
and
how
poor
the
light
is
on
the
slates

you
may
be
*NL*
certain
it
will
rain
before

day
is
out

It
could
n't
possibly
keep
on
*NL*
like
this

it
's
been
too
hot

And
the
sooner
the
better
,
for
until

*NL*
storm
breaks

Vichy
water

she
concluded
,
since
,
in
*NL*
her
mind
,
the
desire
to
accelerate
the
digestion
of
her
Vichy
water
was
*NL*
of
infinitely
greater
importance
than
her
fear
of
seeing
Mme.
Goupil
's
*NL*
new
dress
ruined

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely

``
And
you
know

much

Suddenly
my

turned
pale

o'clock

she
*NL*
exclaimed
.
``

falling
precipitately
upon

a
week
before
the
Rogation-days
.
Ah
,
my
poor
Françoise
,
the
dear
Lord
*NL*
must
be
sorely
vexed
with
us
.
The
world
is
going
too
far
in
these
days
.
*NL*
As
my
poor
Octave
used
to
say
,
we
have
forgotten
God
too
often
,
and
He
*NL*
is
taking
vengeance
upon
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
bright
flush
animated
my
aunt
's
cheeks
;
it
was
Eulalie
.
As
ill
luck
*NL*
would
have
it
,
scarcely
had
she
been
admitted
to
the
presence
when
*NL*
Françoise
reappeared
and
,
with
a
smile
which
was
meant
to
indicate
her
*NL*
full
participation
in
the
pleasure
which
,
she
had
no
doubt
,
her
tidings
*NL*
would
give
my
aunt
,
articulating
each
syllable
so
as
to
shew
that
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
her
having
to
translate
them
into
indirect
speech
,
she
was
*NL*
repeating
,
as
a
good
servant
should
,
the
very
words
which
the
new
*NL*
visitor
had
condescended
to
use
,
said
:
``
His
reverence
the
Curé
would
be
*NL*
delighted
,
enchanted
,
if
Mme.
Octave
is
not
resting
just
now
,
and
*NL*
could
see
him
.
His
reverence
does
not
wish
to
disturb
Mme.
Octave
.
His
*NL*
reverence
is
downstairs
;
I
told
him
to
go
into
the
parlour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
truth
been
known
,
the
Curé
's
visits
gave
my
aunt
no
such
*NL*
ecstatic
pleasure
as
Françoise
supposed
,
and
the
air
of
jubilation
with
*NL*
which
she
felt
bound
to
illuminate
her
face
whenever
she
had
to
announce
*NL*
his
arrival
,
did
not
altogether
correspond
to
what
was
felt
by
her
*NL*
invalid
.
The
Curé
-LRB-
an
excellent
man
,
with
whom
I
am
sorry
now
that
I
did
*NL*
not
converse
more
often
,
for
,
even
if
he
cared
nothing
for
the
arts
,
*NL*
he
knew
a
great
many
etymologies
-RRB-
,
being
in
the
habit
of
shewing
*NL*
distinguished
visitors
over
his
church
-LRB-
he
had
even
planned
to
compile
*NL*
a
history
of
the
Parish
of
Combray
-RRB-
,
used
to
weary
her
with
his
endless
*NL*
explanations
,
which
,
incidentally
,
never
varied
in
the
least
degree
.
*NL*
But
when
his
visit
synchronized
exactly
with
Eulalie
's
it
became
frankly
*NL*
distasteful
to
my
aunt
.
She
would
have
preferred
to
make
the
most
of
*NL*
Eulalie
,
and
not
to
have
had
the
whole
of
her
circle
about
her
at
one
*NL*
time
.
But
she
dared
not
send
the
Curé
away
,
and
had
to
content
herself
*NL*
with
making
a
sign
to
Eulalie
not
to
leave
when
he
did
,
so
that
she
*NL*
might
have
her
to
herself
for
a
little
after
he
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
I
have
been
hearing
,
Father
,
that
a
painter
has
set
up
his
*NL*
easel
in
your
church
,
and
is
copying
one
of
the
windows
?
Old
as
I
am
,
*NL*
I
can
safely
say
that
I
have
never
even
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
all
my
*NL*
life
!
What
is
the
world
coming
to
next
,
I
wonder
!
And
the
ugliest
thing
*NL*
in
the
whole
church
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
is
quite
the
ugliest
,
for
,
*NL*
although
there
are
certain
things
in
Saint-Hilaire
which
are
well
worth
*NL*
a
visit
,
there
are
others
that
are
very
old
now
,
in
my
poor
basilica
,
*NL*
the
only
one
in
all
the
diocese
that
has
never
even
been
restored
.
*NL*
The
Lord
knows
,
our
porch
is
dirty
and
out
of
date
;
still
,
it
is
of
a
*NL*
majestic
character
;
take
,
for
instance
,
the
Esther
tapestries
,
though
*NL*
personally
I
would
not
give
a
brass
farthing
for
the
pair
of
them
,
but
*NL*
experts
put
them
next
after
the
ones
at
Sens.
I
can
quite
see
,
too
,
that
*NL*
apart
from
certain
details
which
are
--
well
,
a
trifle
realistic
,
they
*NL*
shew
features
which
testify
to
a
genuine
power
of
observation
.
But
do
n't
*NL*
talk
to
me
about
the
windows
.
Is
it
common
sense
,
I
ask
you
,
to
leave
*NL*
up
windows
which
shut
out
all
the
daylight
,
and
even
confuse
the
eyes
by
*NL*
throwing
patches
of
colour
,
to
which
I
should
be
hard
put
to
it
to
give
*NL*
a
name
,
on
a
floor
in
which
there
are
not
two
slabs
on
the
same
level
?
*NL*
And
yet
they
refuse
to
renew
the
floor
for
me
because
,
if
you
please
,
*NL*
those
are
the
tombstones
of
the
Abbots
of
Combray
and
the
Lords
of
*NL*
Guermantes
,
the
old
Counts
,
you
know
,
of
Brabant
,
direct
ancestors
of
*NL*
the
present
Duc
de
Guermantes
,
and
of
his
Duchesse
also
,
since
she
was
a
*NL*
lady
of
the
Guermantes
family
,
and
married
her
cousin
.
''
-LRB-
My
grandmother
,
*NL*
whose
steady
refusal
to
take
any
interest
in
`
persons
'
had
ended
in
*NL*
her
confusing
all
their
names
and
titles
,
whenever
anyone
mentioned
the
*NL*
Duchesse
de
Guermantes
used
to
make
out
that
she
must
be
related
to
Mme.
*NL*
de
Villeparisis
.
The
whole
family
would
then
burst
out
laughing
;
and
she
*NL*
would
attempt
to
justify
herself
by
harking
back
to
some
invitation
to
*NL*
a
christening
or
funeral
:
``
I
feel
sure
that
there
was
a
Guermantes
in
it
*NL*
somewhere
.
''
And
for
once
I
would
side
with
the
others
,
and
against
*NL*
her
,
refusing
to
admit
that
there
could
be
any
connection
between
her
*NL*
school-friend
and
the
descendant
of
Geneviève

It
is
nothing
more
nowadays

than
a
parish

in
olden

the

had
*NL*
a
considerable
importance
from
its
trade

-LRB-
I
*NL*
am
not
certain

by

way

the
etymology

Roussainville

I

should
dearly

Very
well
;
the
*NL*
church
there
has
superb
windows
,
almost
all
quite
modern
,
including
that
*NL*
most
imposing
`
Entry
of
Louis-Philippe
into
Combray
'
which
would
be
more
*NL*
in
keeping
,
surely
,
at
Combray
itself
,
and
which
is
every
bit
as
good
,
I
*NL*
understand
,
as
the
famous
windows
at
Chartres
.
Only
yesterday
I
met
Dr.
*NL*
Percepied
's
brother
,
who
goes
in
for
these
things
,
and
he
told
me
that
*NL*
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
most
beautiful
piece
of
work
.
But
,
as
I
said
to
*NL*
this
artist
,
who
,
by
the
way
,
seems
to
be
a
most
civil
fellow
,
and
is
a
*NL*
regular
virtuoso
,
it
appears
,
with
his
brush
;
what
on
earth
,
I
said
to
*NL*
him
,
do
you
find
so
extraordinary
in
this
window
,
which
is
,
if
anything
,
*NL*
a
little
dingier
than
the
rest

I
am
sure
that
if
you
were

said
my
aunt
in

a

tone

she
had
begun
to
feel
that
she
was
going

be

`
tired

You
may
depend

replied
the
Curé

``
Why
,
it
was
*NL*
just
his
Lordship
himself

started
the
outcry
about
the
window
,
by
*NL*
proving
that
it
represented
Gilbert
the
Bad
,
a
Lord
of
Guermantes
and
*NL*
a
direct
descendant
of
Geneviève
de
Brabant
,
who
was
a
daughter
of
the
*NL*
House
of
Guermantes
,
receiving
absolution
from
Saint

*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't

where
Saint

comes
in

*NL*

``
Why
yes
,
have
you
never
noticed
,
in
the
corner
of
the
window
,
a
lady
in
*NL*
a
yellow
robe
?
Very
well
,
that
is
Saint
Hilaire
,
who
is
also
known

you
*NL*
will
remember
,
in
certain
parts

country
as
Saint
Illiers
,
Saint
*NL*
Hèlier

even
,
in
the
Jura
,
Saint
Ylie

But
these
various
corruptions
*NL*
of

Sanctus
Hilarius
_
are
by
no
means
the
most
curious
that
have
*NL*
occurred
in
the
names
of
the
blessed
Saints

Take
,
for
example
,
my
good
*NL*
Eulalie
,
the
case
of
your
own
patron
,
_
Sancta
Eulalia
_

do
you
know
what
*NL*
she
has
become
in
Burgundy
?
Saint
Eloi
,
nothing
more
nor
less
!
The
lady
*NL*
has
become
a
gentleman

Do
you
hear
that

after
you
are
dead

will
make
a
man
of
you

Gilbert
's
brother
,
Charles
the
Stammerer
,
was
a
pious
prince
,
but
,
*NL*
having
early
in
life
lost
his
father
,
Pepin
the
Mad
,
who
died
as
a
*NL*
result
of
his
mental
infirmity
,
he
wielded
the
supreme
power
with
all
*NL*
the
arrogance
of
a
man
who
has
not
been
subjected
to
discipline
in
his
*NL*
youth
,
so
much
so
that
,
whenever
he
saw
a
man
in
a
town
whose
face
*NL*
he
did
not
remember
,
he
would
massacre
the
whole
place
,
to
the
last
*NL*
inhabitant
.
Gilbert
,
wishing
to
be
avenged
on
Charles
,
caused
the
church
*NL*
at
Combray
to
be
burned
down
,
the
original
church
,
that
was
,
which
*NL*
Théodebert
,
when
he
and
his
court
left
the
country
residence
he
had
near
*NL*
here
,
at
Thiberzy
-LRB-

is
,
of
course

_
Theodeberiacus

-RRB-
,
to
go
out
*NL*
and
fight
the
Burgundians
,
had
promised
to
build
over
the
tomb
of
Saint
*NL*
Hilaire
if
the
Saint
brought
him
;
victory
.
Nothing
remains
of
it
now
*NL*
but
the
crypt
,
into
which
Théodore
has
probably
taken
you
,
for
Gilbert
*NL*
burned
all
the
rest
.
Finally
,
he
defeated
the
unlucky
Charles
with
the
*NL*
aid
of
William
''
which
the
Curé
pronounced
``
Will
`
am
''
``
the
Conqueror
,
*NL*
which
is
why
so
many
English
still
come
to
visit
the
place
.
But
he
*NL*
does
not
appear
to
have
managed
to
win
the
affection
of
the
people
of
*NL*
Combray
,
for
they
fell
upon
him
as
he
was
coming
out
from
mass
,
and
cut
*NL*
off
his
head
.
Théodore
has
a
little
book

he
lends
people

tells

But
what

full

grandeur

Certainly
in

just
half

as
you
have
to
go
on
your
hands

do
n't
wish
to
crack
your
skull
,
and
you
collect
all
the
cobwebs
off
*NL*
the
staircase
upon
your
clothes

In
any
case
you
should
be
well
wrapped

up

went
on

noticing
my

fury

suggestion

could
ever

be
capable
of
climbing
into
his
belfry
,
*NL*
``
for
there
's
a
strong
breeze
there
,
once
you
get
to
the
top

Some
people
*NL*
even
assure
me
that
they
have
felt
the
chill
of
death
up
there

No
*NL*
matter
,
on
Sundays
there
are
always
clubs
and
societies
,
who
come
,
*NL*
some
of
them
,
long
distances
to
admire
our
beautiful
panorama
,
and
they
*NL*
always
go
home
charmed

Wait
now
,
next
Sunday
,
if
the
weather
holds
,
you
*NL*
will
be
sure
to
find
a
lot
of
people
there

for
Rogation-tide
.
You
must
*NL*
admit
,
certainly
,
that
the
view
from
up
there
is
like
a
fairy-tale
,
with
*NL*
what
you
might
call
vistas
along
the
plain
,
which
have
quite
a
special
*NL*
charm
of
their
own
.
On
a
clear
day
you
can
see
as
far
as
Verneuil

*NL*
then
another
thing
;
you
can
see
at
the
same
time
places
which
you
are
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
seeing
one
without
the
other
,
as
,
for
instance
,
the
course
*NL*
of
the
Vivonne
and
the
ditches
at
Saint-Assise-lès-Combray
,
which
*NL*
are
separated
,
really
,
by
a
screen
of
tall
trees
;
or
,
to
take
another
*NL*
example
,
there
are
all
the
canals
at
Jouy-le-Vicomte
,
which
is
*NL*
_
Gaudiacus
vicecomitis
_
,
as
of
course
you
know
.
Each
time
that
I
have
*NL*
been
to
Jouy
I
have
seen
a
bit
of
a
canal
in
one
place
,
and
then
I
have
*NL*
turned
a
corner
and
seen
another
,
but
when
I
saw
the
second
I
could
no
*NL*
longer
see
the
first
.
I
tried
in
vain
to
imagine
how
they
lay
by
one
*NL*
another
;
it
was
no
good
.
But
,
from
the
top
of
Saint-Hilaire
,
it
's
quite
*NL*
another
matter
;
the
whole
countryside
is
spread
out
before
you
like
a
*NL*
map
.
Only
,
you
can
not
make
out
the
water
;
you
would
say
that
there
were
*NL*
great
rifts
in
the
town
,
slicing
it
up
so
neatly
that
it
looks
like
a
*NL*
loaf
of
bread
which
still
holds
together
after
it
has
been
cut
up
.
To
*NL*
get
it
all
quite
perfect
you
would
have
to
be
in
both
places
at
once
;
up
*NL*
here
on
the
top
of
Saint-Hilaire
and
down
there
at
Jouy-le-Vicomte

a
coin
from
*NL*
a
small
purse
which
lay
ready
to
her
hand
.
``
This
is
just
something
so
*NL*
that
you
shall
not
forget
me
in
your
prayers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
,
Mme.
Octave
,
I
do
n't
think
I
ought
to
;
you
know
very
well
*NL*
that
I
do
n't
come
here
for
that
!
''
So
Eulalie
would
answer
,
with
the
*NL*
same
hesitation
and
the
same
embarrassment
,
every
Sunday
,
as
though
*NL*
each
temptation
were
the
first
,
and
with
a
look
of
displeasure
which
*NL*
enlivened
my
aunt
and
never
offended
her
,
for
if
it
so
happened
that
*NL*
Eulalie
,
when
she
took
the
money
,
looked
a
little
less
sulky
than
usual
,
*NL*
my
aunt
would
remark
afterwards
,
``
I
can
not
think
what
has
come
over
*NL*
Eulalie
;
I
gave
her
just
the
trifle
I
always
give
,
and
she
did
not
look
*NL*
at
all
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
she
has
very
much
to
complain
of
,
all
the
same
,
''
*NL*
Françoise
would
sigh
grimly
,
for
she
had
a
tendency
to
regard
as
petty
*NL*
cash
all
that
my
aunt
might
give
her
for
herself
or
her
children
,
and
as
*NL*
treasure
riotously
squandered
on
a
pampered
and
ungrateful
darling
the
*NL*
little
coins
slipped
,
Sunday
by
Sunday
,
into
Eulalie
's
hand
,
but
so
*NL*
discreetly
passed
that
Françoise
never
managed
to
see
them
.
It
was
*NL*
not
that
she
wanted
to
have
for
herself
the
money
my
aunt
bestowed
*NL*
on
Eulalie
.
She
already
enjoyed
a
sufficiency
of
all
that
my
*NL*
aunt
possessed
,
in
the
knowledge
that
the
wealth
of
the
mistress
*NL*
automatically
ennobled
and
glorified
the
maid
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
;
*NL*
and
that
she
herself
was
conspicuous
and
worthy
to
be
praised
throughout
*NL*
Combray
,
Jouy-le-Vicomte
,
and
other
cities
of
men
,
on
account
of
my
*NL*
aunt
's
many
farms
,
her
frequent
and
prolonged
visits
from
the
Curé
,
and
*NL*
the
astonishing
number
of
bottles
of
Vichy
water
which
she
consumed
.
*NL*
Françoise
was
avaricious
only
for
my
aunt
;
had
she
had
control
over
*NL*
my
aunt
's
fortune
-LRB-
which
would
have
more
than
satisfied
her
highest
*NL*
ambition
-RRB-
she
would
have
guarded
it
from
the
assaults
of
strangers
with
*NL*
a
maternal
ferocity
.
She
would
,
however
,
have
seen
no
great
harm
in
what
*NL*
my
aunt
,
whom
she
knew
to
be
incurably
generous
,
allowed
herself
to
give
*NL*
away
,
had
she
given
only
to
those
who
were
already
rich
.
Perhaps
*NL*
she
felt
that
such
persons
,
not
being
actually
in
need
of
my
aunt
's
*NL*
presents
,
could
not
be
suspected
of
simulating
affection
for
her
on
*NL*
that
account
.
Besides
,
presents
offered
to
persons
of
great
wealth
and
*NL*
position
,
such
as
Mme.
Sazerat
,
M.
Swann
,
M.
Legrandin
and
Mme.
Goupil
,
*NL*
to
persons
of
the
`
same
class
'
as
my
aunt
,
and
who
would
naturally
*NL*
`
mix
with
her
,
'
seemed
to
Françoise
to
be
included
among
the
ornamental
*NL*
customs
of
that
strange
and
brilliant
life
led
by
rich
people
,
who
*NL*
hunted
and
shot
,
gave
balls
and
paid
visits
,
a
life
which
she
would
*NL*
contemplate
with
an
admiring
smile
.
But
it
was
by
no
means
the
same
*NL*
thing
if
,
for
this
princely
exchange
of
courtesies
,
my
aunt
substituted
*NL*
mere
charity
,
if
her
beneficiaries
were
of
the
class
which
Françoise
*NL*
would
label
``
people
like
myself
,
''
or
``
people
no
better
than
myself
,
''
*NL*
people
whom
she
despised
even
more
if
they
did
not
address
her
always
*NL*
as
``
Mme.
Françoise
,
''
just
to
shew
that
they
considered
themselves
to
be
*NL*
`
not
as
good
.
'
And
when
she
saw
that
,
despite
all
her
warnings
,
my
aunt
*NL*
continued
to
do
exactly
as
she
pleased
,
and
to
fling
money
away
with
*NL*
both
hands
-LRB-
or
so
,
at
least
,
Françoise
believed
-RRB-
on
undeserving
objects
,
*NL*
she
began
to
find
that
the
presents
she
herself
received
from
my
aunt
*NL*
were
very
tiny
compared
to
the
imaginary
riches
squandered
upon
*NL*
Eulalie
,
There
was
not
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Combray
,
a
farm
of
such
*NL*
prosperity
and
importance
that
Françoise
doubted
Eulalie
's
ability
to
*NL*
buy
it
,
without
thinking
twice
,
out
of
the
capital
which
her
visits
to
*NL*
my
aunt
had
`
brought
in
.
'
It
must
be
added
that
Eulalie
had
formed
an
*NL*
exactly
similar
estimate
of
the
vast
and
secret
hoards
of
Françoise
.
*NL*
So
,
every
Sunday
,
after
Eulalie
had
gone
,
Françoise
would
mercilessly
*NL*
prophesy
her
coming
downfall
.
She
hated
Eulalie
,
but
was
at
the
same
*NL*
time
afraid
of
her
,
and
so
felt
bound
,
when
Eulalie
was
there
,
to
`
look
*NL*
pleasant
.
'
But
she
would
make
up
for
that
after
the
other
's
departure
;
*NL*
never
,
it
is
true
,
alluding
to
her
by
name
,
but
hinting
at
her
in
*NL*
Sibylline
oracles
,
or
in
utterances
of
a
comprehensive
character
,
like
*NL*
those
of
Ecclesiastes
,
the
Preacher
,
but
so
worded
that
their
special
*NL*
application
could
not
escape
my
aunt
.
After
peering
out
at
the
side
of
*NL*
the
curtain
to
see
whether
Eulalie
had
shut
the
front-door
behind
her
;
*NL*
``
Flatterers
know
how
to
make
themselves
welcome
,
and
to
gather
up
the
*NL*
crumbs
;
but
have
patience
,
have
patience
;
our
God
is
a
jealous
God
,
and
*NL*
one
fine
day
He
will
be
avenged
upon
them
!
''
she
would
declaim
,
with
the
*NL*
sidelong
,
insinuating
glance
of
Joash
,
thinking
of
Athaliah
alone
when
*NL*
he
says
that
the
*NL*
*NL*
...
prosperity
*NL*
Of
wicked
men
runs
like
a
torrent
past
,
*NL*
And
soon
is
spent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
this
memorable
afternoon
,
when
the
Curé
had
come
as
well
,
and
*NL*
by
his
interminable
visit
had
drained
my
aunt
's
strength
,
Françoise
*NL*
followed
Eulalie
from
the
room
,
saying
:
``
Mme.
Octave
,
I
will
leave
you
*NL*
to
rest
;
you
look
utterly
tired
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
my
aunt
answered
her
not
a
word
,
breathing
a
sigh
so
faint
that
*NL*
it
seemed
it
must
prove
her
last
,
and
lying
there
with
closed
eyes
,
as
*NL*
though
already
dead
.
But
hardly
had
Françoise
arrived
downstairs
,
when
*NL*
four
peals
of
a
bell
,
pulled
with
the
utmost
violence
,
reverberated
*NL*
through
the
house
,
and
my
aunt
,
sitting
erect
upon
her
bed
,
called
out
:
*NL*
``
Has
Eulalie
gone
yet
?
Would
you
believe
it
;
I
forgot
to
ask
her
whether
*NL*
Mme.
Goupil
arrived
in
church
before
the
Elevation
.
Run
after
her
,
*NL*
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Françoise
returned
alone
,
having
failed
to
overtake
Eulalie
.
``
It
*NL*
is
most
provoking
,
''
said
my
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
The
one
important
*NL*
thing
that
I
had
to
ask
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
life
went
by
for
my
aunt
Léonie
,
always
the
same
,
in
the
*NL*
gentle
uniformity
of
what
she
called
,
with
a
pretence
of
deprecation
*NL*
but
with
a
deep
tenderness
,
her
`
little
jog-trot
.
'
Respected
by
all
*NL*
and
sundry
,
not
merely
in
her
own
house
,
where
every
one
of
us
,
having
*NL*
learned
the
futility
of
recommending
any
healthier
mode
of
life
,
had
*NL*
become
gradually
resigned
to
its
observance
,
but
in
the
village
as
well
,
*NL*
where
,
three
streets
away
,
a
tradesman
who
had
to
hammer
nails
into
a
*NL*
packing-case
would
send
first
to
Françoise
to
make
sure
that
my
aunt
*NL*
was
not
`
resting
'
--
her
`
little
jog-trot
'
was
,
none
the
less
,
brutally
*NL*
disturbed
on
one
occasion
in
this
same
year
.
Like
a
fruit
hidden
among
*NL*
its
leaves
,
which
has
grown
and
ripened
unobserved
by
man
,
until
it
*NL*
falls
of
its
own
accord
,
there
came
upon
us
one
night
the
kitchen-maid
's
*NL*
confinement
.
Her
pains
were
unbearable
,
and
,
as
there
was
no
midwife
*NL*
in
Combray
,
Françoise
had
to
set
off
before
dawn
to
fetch
one
from
*NL*
Thiberzy
.
My
aunt
was
unable
to
`
rest
,
'
owing
to
the
cries
of
the
girl
,
*NL*
and
as
Françoise
,
though
the
distance
was
nothing
,
was
very
late
in
*NL*
returning
,
her
services
were
greatly
missed
.
And
so
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
the
morning
,
my
mother
said
to
me
:
``
Run
upstairs
,
and
see
if
your
aunt
*NL*
wants
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
into
the
first
of
her
two
rooms
,
and
through
the
open
door
of
the
*NL*
other
saw
my
aunt
lying
on
her
side
,
asleep
.
I
could
hear
her
breathing
,
*NL*
in
what
was
almost
distinguishable
as
a
snore
.
I
was
just
going
to
slip
*NL*
away
when
something
,
probably
the
sound
of
my
entry
,
interrupted
her
*NL*
sleep
,
and
made
it
`
change
speed
,
'
as
they
say
of
motorcars
nowadays
,
*NL*
for
the
music
of
her
snore
broke
off
for
a
second
and
began
again
on
a
*NL*
lower
note
;
then
she
awoke
,
and
half
turned
her
face
,
which
I
could
see
*NL*
for
the
first
time
;
a
kind
of
horror
was
imprinted
on
it
;
plainly
she
*NL*
had
just
escaped
from
some
terrifying
dream
.
She
could
not
see
me
from
*NL*
where
she
was
lying
,
and
I
stood
there
not
knowing
whether
I
ought
to
go
*NL*
forward
or
to
retire
;
but
all
at
once
she
seemed
to
return
to
a
sense
*NL*
of
reality
,
and
to
grasp
the
falsehood
of
the
visions
that
had
terrified
*NL*
her
;
a
smile
of
joy
,
a
pious
act
of
thanksgiving
to
God
,
Who
is
pleased
*NL*
to
grant
that
life
shall
be
less
cruel
than
our
dreams
,
feebly
illumined
*NL*
her
face
,
and
,
with
the
habit
she
had
formed
of
speaking
to
herself
,
*NL*
half-aloud
,
when
she
thought
herself
alone
,
she
murmured
:
``
The
Lord
be
*NL*
praised
!
We
have
nothing
to
disturb
us
here
but
the
kitchen-maid
's
baby
.
*NL*
And
I
've
been
dreaming
that
my
poor
Octave
had
come
back
to
life
,
and
*NL*
was
trying
to
make
me
take
a
walk
every
day
!
''
She
stretched
out
a
hand
*NL*
towards
her
rosary
,
which
was
lying
on
the
small
table
,
but
sleep
was
*NL*
once
again
getting
the
mastery
,
and
did
not
leave
her
the
strength
to
*NL*
reach
it
;
she
fell
asleep
,
calm
and
contented
,
and
I
crept
out
of
the
*NL*
room
on
tiptoe
,
without
either
her
or
anyone
's
else
ever
knowing
,
from
*NL*
that
day
to
this
,
what
I
had
seen
and
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
say
that
,
apart
from
such
rare
happenings
as
this
confinement
,
my
*NL*
aunt
's
`
little
jog-trot
'
never
underwent
any
variation
,
I
do
not
include
*NL*
those
variations
which
,
repeated
at
regular
intervals
and
in
identical
*NL*
form
,
did
no
more
,
really
,
than
print
a
sort
of
uniform
pattern
upon
*NL*
the
greater
uniformity
of
her
life
.
So
,
for
instance
,
every
Saturday
,
as
*NL*
Françoise
had
to
go
in
the
afternoon
to
market
at
Roussainville-le-Pin
,
*NL*
the
whole
household
would
have
to
have
luncheon
an
hour
earlier
.
And
my
*NL*
aunt
had
so
thoroughly
acquired
the
habit
of
this
weekly
exception
to
*NL*
her
general
habits
,
that
she
clung
to
it
as
much
as
to
the
rest
.
She
*NL*
was
so
well
`
routined
'
to
it
,
as
Françoise
would
say
,
that
if
,
on
a
*NL*
Saturday
,
she
had
had
to
wait
for
her
luncheon
until
the
regular
hour
,
*NL*
it
would
have
`
upset
'
her
as
much
as
if
she
had
had
,
on
an
ordinary
*NL*
day
,
to
put
her
luncheon
forward
to
its
Saturday
time
.
Incidentally
this
*NL*
acceleration
of
luncheon
gave
Saturday
,
for
all
of
us
,
an
individual
*NL*
character
,
kindly
and
rather
attractive
.
At
the
moment
when
,
ordinarily
,
*NL*
there
was
still
an
hour
to
be
lived
through
before
meal-time
sounded
,
*NL*
we
would
all
know
that
in
a
few
seconds
we
should
see
the
endives
*NL*
make
their
precocious
appearance
,
followed
by
the
special
favour
of
an
*NL*
omelette
,
an
unmerited
steak
.
The
return
of
this
asymmetrical
Saturday
*NL*
was
one
of
those
petty
occurrences
,
intra-mural
,
localised
,
almost
*NL*
civic
,
which
,
in
uneventful
lives
and
stable
orders
of
society
,
create
a
*NL*
kind
of
national
unity
,
and
become
the
favourite
theme
for
conversation
,
*NL*
for
pleasantries
,
for
anecdotes
which
can
be
embroidered
as
the
narrator
*NL*
pleases
;
it
would
have
provided
a
nucleus
,
ready-made
,
for
a
legendary
*NL*
cycle
,
if
any
of
us
had
had
the
epic
mind
.
At
daybreak
,
before
we
were
*NL*
dressed
,
without
rhyme
or
reason
,
save
for
the
pleasure
of
proving
the
*NL*
strength
of
our
solidarity
,
we
would
call
to
one
another
good-humoredly
,
*NL*
cordially
,
patriotically
,
``
Hurry
up
;
there
's
no
time
to
be
lost
;
do
n't
*NL*
forget
,
it
's
Saturday
!
''
while
my
aunt
,
gossiping
with
Françoise
,
and
*NL*
reflecting
that
the
day
would
be
even
longer
than
usual
,
would
say
,
``
You
*NL*
might
cook
them
a
nice
bit
of
veal
,
seeing
that
it
's
Saturday
.
''
If
,
at
*NL*
half-past
ten
,
some
one
absent-mindedly
pulled
out
a
watch
and
said
,
``
I
*NL*
say
,
an
hour-and-a-half
still
before
luncheon
,
''
everyone
else
would
*NL*
be
in
ecstasies
over
being
able
to
retort
at
once
:
``
Why
,
what
are
you
*NL*
thinking
about
?
Have
you
for-gotten
that
it
's
Saturday
?
''
And
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
later
we
would
still
be
laughing
,
and
reminding
ourselves
to
*NL*
go
up
and
tell
aunt
Léonie
about
this
absurd
mistake
,
to
amuse
her
.
The
*NL*
very
face
of
the
sky
appeared
to
undergo
a
change
.
After
luncheon
the
*NL*
sun
,
conscious
that
it
was
Saturday
,
would
blaze
an
hour
longer
in
the
*NL*
zenith
,
and
when
some
one
,
thinking
that
we
were
late
in
starting
for
*NL*
our
walk
,
said
,
``
What
,
only
two
o'clock
!
''
feeling
the
heavy
throb
go
by
*NL*
him
of
the
twin
strokes
from
the
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
-LRB-
which
as
*NL*
a
rule
passed
no
one
at
that
hour
upon
the
highways
,
deserted
for
the
*NL*
midday
meal
or
for
the
nap
which
follows
it
,
or
on
the
banks
of
the
*NL*
bright
and
ever-flowing
stream
,
which
even
the
angler
had
abandoned
,
and
*NL*
so
slipped
unaccompanied
into
the
vacant
sky
,
where
only
a
few
loitering
*NL*
clouds
remained
to
greet
them
-RRB-
the
whole
family
would
respond
in
chorus
:
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
're
forgetting
;
we
had
luncheon
an
hour
earlier
;
you
know
very
*NL*
well
it
's
Saturday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
surprise
of
a
`
barbarian
'
-LRB-
for
so
we
termed
everyone
who
was
not
*NL*
acquainted
with
Saturday
's
special
customs
-RRB-
who
had
called
at
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
to
speak
to
my
father
,
and
had
found
us
at
table
,
was
an
event
*NL*
which
used
to
cause
Françoise
as
much
merriment
as
,
perhaps
,
anything
*NL*
that
had
ever
happened
in
her
life
.
And
if
she
found
it
amusing
that
the
*NL*
nonplussed
visitor
should
not
have
known
,
beforehand
,
that
we
had
our
*NL*
luncheon
an
hour
earlier
on
Saturday
,
it
was
still
more
irresistibly
*NL*
funny
that
my
father
himself
-LRB-
fully
as
she
sympathised
,
from
the
bottom
*NL*
of
her
heart
,
with
the
rigid
chauvinism
which
prompted
him
-RRB-
should
never
*NL*
have
dreamed
that
the
barbarian
could
fail
to
be
aware
of
so
simple
a
*NL*
matter
,
and
so
had
replied
,
with
no
further
enlightenment
of
the
*NL*
other
's
surprise
at
seeing
us
already
in
the
dining-room
:
``
You
see
,
it
's
*NL*
Saturday
.
''
On
reaching
this
point
in
the
story
,
Françoise
would
pause
to
*NL*
wipe
the
tears
of
merriment
from
her
eyes
,
and
then
,
to
add
to
her
own
*NL*
enjoyment
,
would
prolong
the
dialogue
,
inventing
a
further
reply
for
*NL*
the
visitor
to
whom
the
word
`
Saturday
'
had
conveyed
nothing
.
And
so
far
*NL*
from
our
objecting
to
these
interpolations
,
we
would
feel
that
the
story
*NL*
was
not
yet
long
enough
,
and
would
rally
her
with
:
``
Oh
,
but
surely
he
*NL*
said
something
else
as
well
.
There
was
more
than
that
,
the
first
time
*NL*
you
told
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
great-aunt
herself
would
lay
aside
her
work
,
and
raise
her
head
and
*NL*
look
on
at
us
over
her
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
had
yet
another
characteristic
feature
,
namely
,
that
during
May
*NL*
we
used
to
go
out
on
Saturday
evenings
after
dinner
to
the
`
Month
of
*NL*
Mary
'
devotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
were
liable
,
there
,
to
meet
M.
Vinteuil
,
who
held
very
strict
*NL*
views
on
``
the
deplorable
untidiness
of
young
people
,
which
seems
to
*NL*
be
encouraged
in
these
days
,
''
my
mother
would
first
see
that
there
was
*NL*
nothing
out
of
order
in
my
appearance
,
and
then
we
would
set
out
for
*NL*
the
church
.
It
was
in
these
`
Month
of
Mary
'
services
that
I
can
remember
*NL*
having
first
fallen
in
love
with
hawthorn-blossom
.
The
hawthorn
was
not
*NL*
merely
in
the
church
,
for
there
,
holy
ground
as
it
was
,
we
had
all
of
us
*NL*
a
right
of
entry
;
but
,
arranged
upon
the
altar
itself
,
inseparable
from
*NL*
the
mysteries
in
whose
celebration
it
was
playing
a
part
,
it
thrust
in
*NL*
among
the
tapers
and
the
sacred
vessels
its
rows
of
branches
,
tied
to
*NL*
one
another
horizontally
in
a
stiff
,
festal
scheme
of
decoration
;
and
*NL*
they
were
made
more
lovely
still
by
the
scalloped
outline
of
the
dark
*NL*
leaves
,
over
which
were
scattered
in
profusion
,
as
over
a
bridal
train
,
*NL*
little
clusters
of
buds
of
a
dazzling
whiteness
.
Though
I
dared
not
look
*NL*
at
them
save
through
my
fingers
,
I
could
feel
that
the
formal
scheme
*NL*
was
composed
of
living
things
,
and
that
it
was
Nature
herself
who
,
by
*NL*
trimming
the
shape
of
the
foliage
,
and
by
adding
the
crowning
ornament
*NL*
of
those
snowy
buds
,
had
made
the
decorations
worthy
of
what
was
at
*NL*
once
a
public
rejoicing
and
a
solemn
mystery
.
Higher
up
on
the
altar
,
*NL*
a
flower
had
opened
here
and
there
with
a
careless
grace
,
holding
so
*NL*
unconcernedly
,
like
a
final
,
almost
vaporous
bedizening
,
its
bunch
of
*NL*
stamens
,
slender
as
gossamer
,
which
clouded
the
flower
itself
in
a
*NL*
white
mist
,
that
in
following
these
with
my
eyes
,
in
trying
to
imitate
,
*NL*
somewhere
inside
myself
,
the
action
of
their
blossoming
,
I
imagined
it
*NL*
as
a
swift
and
thoughtless
movement
of
the
head
with
an
enticing
glance
*NL*
from
her
contracted
pupils
,
by
a
young
girl
in
white
,
careless
and
*NL*
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Vinteuil
had
come
in
with
his
daughter
and
had
sat
down
beside
us
.
*NL*
He
belonged
to
a
good
family
,
and
had
once
been
music-master
to
*NL*
my
grandmother
's
sisters
;
so
that
when
,
after
losing
his
wife
and
*NL*
inheriting
some
property
,
he
had
retired
to
the
neighbourhood
of
*NL*
Combray
,
we
used
often
to
invite
him
to
our
house
.
But
with
his
intense
*NL*
prudishness
he
had
given
up
coming
,
so
as
not
to
be
obliged
to
meet
*NL*
Swann
,
who
had
made
what
he
called
``
a
most
unsuitable
marriage
,
as
*NL*
seems
to
be
the
fashion
in
these
days
.
''
My
mother
,
on
hearing
that
he
*NL*
`
composed
,
'
told
him
by
way
of
a
compliment
that
,
when
she
came
to
see
*NL*
him
,
he
must
play
her
something
of
his
own
.
M.
Vinteuil
would
have
liked
*NL*
nothing
better
,
but
he
carried
politeness
and
consideration
for
others
*NL*
to
so
fine
a
point
,
always
putting
himself
in
their
place
,
that
he
was
*NL*
afraid
of
boring
them
,
or
of
appearing
egotistical
,
if
he
carried
out
,
*NL*
or
even
allowed
them
to
suspect
what
were
his
own
desires
.
On
the
day
*NL*
when
my
parents
had
gone
to
pay
him
a
visit
,
I
had
accompanied
them
,
*NL*
but
they
had
allowed
me
to
remain
outside
,
and
as
M.
Vinteuil
's
house
,
*NL*
Montjouvain
,
stood
on
a
site
actually
hollowed
out
from
a
steep
hill
*NL*
covered
with
shrubs
,
among
which
I
took
cover
,
I
had
found
myself
on
a
*NL*
level
with
his
drawing-room
,
upstairs
,
and
only
a
few
feet
away
from
its
*NL*
window
.
When
a
servant
came
in
to
tell
him
that
my
parents
had
arrived
,
*NL*
I
had
seen
M.
Vinteuil
run
to
the
piano
and
lay
out
a
sheet
of
music
*NL*
so
as
to
catch
the
eye
.
But
as
soon
as
they
entered
the
room
he
had
*NL*
snatched
it
away
and
hidden
it
in
a
corner
.
He
was
afraid
,
no
doubt
,
of
*NL*
letting
them
suppose
that
he
was
glad
to
see
them
only
because
it
gave
*NL*
him
a
chance
of
playing
them
some
of
his
compositions
.
And
every
time
*NL*
that
my
mother
,
in
the
course
of
her
visit
,
had
returned
to
the
subject
*NL*
of
his
playing
,
he
had
hurriedly
protested
:
``
I
can
not
think
who
put
that
*NL*
on
the
piano
;
it
is
not
the
proper
place
for
it
at
all
,
''
and
had
turned
*NL*
the
conversation
aside
to
other
topics
,
simply
because
those
were
of
*NL*
less
interest
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
one
and
only
passion
was
for
his
daughter
,
and
she
,
with
her
*NL*
somewhat
boyish
appearance
,
looked
so
robust
that
it
was
hard
to
*NL*
restrain
a
smile
when
one
saw
the
precautions
her
father
used
to
take
*NL*
for
her
health
,
with
spare
shawls
always
in
readiness
to
wrap
around
*NL*
her
shoulders
.
My
grandmother
had
drawn
our
attention
to
the
gentle
,
*NL*
delicate
,
almost
timid
expression
which
might
often
be
caught
flitting
*NL*
across
the
face
,
dusted
all
over
with
freckles
,
of
this
otherwise
stolid
*NL*
child
.
When
she
had
spoken
,
she
would
at
once
take
her
own
words
in
the
*NL*
sense
in
which
her
audience
must
have
heard
them
,
she
would
be
alarmed
*NL*
at
the
possibility
of
a
misunderstanding
,
and
one
would
see
,
in
clear
*NL*
outline
,
as
though
in
a
transparency
,
beneath
the
mannish
face
of
the
*NL*
`
good
sort
'
that
she
was
,
the
finer
features
of
a
young
woman
in
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
before
turning
to
leave
the
church
,
I
made
a
genuflection
before
*NL*
the
altar
,
I
felt
suddenly
,
as
I
rose
again
,
a
bitter-sweet
fragrance
of
*NL*
almonds
steal
towards
me
from
the
hawthorn-blossom
,
and
I
then
noticed
*NL*
that
on
the
flowers
themselves
were
little
spots
of
a
creamier
colour
,
*NL*
in
which
I
imagined
that
this
fragrance
must
lie
concealed
,
as
the
taste
*NL*
of
an
almond
cake
lay
in
the
burned
parts
,
or
the
sweetness
of
Mlle.
*NL*
Vinteuil
's
cheeks
beneath
their
freckles
.
Despite
the
heavy
,
motionless
*NL*
silence
of
the
hawthorns
,
these
gusts
of
fragrance
came
to
me
like
*NL*
the
murmuring
of
an
intense
vitality
,
with
which
the
whole
altar
was
*NL*
quivering
like
a
roadside
hedge
explored
by
living
antennae
,
of
which
I
*NL*
was
reminded
by
seeing
some
stamens
,
almost
red
in
colour
,
which
seemed
*NL*
to
have
kept
the
springtime
virulence
,
the
irritant
power
of
stinging
*NL*
insects
now
transmuted
into
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
church
we
would
stand
talking
for
a
moment
with
M.
Vinteuil
,
*NL*
in
the
porch
.
Boys
would
be
chevying
one
another
in
the
Square
,
and
he
*NL*
would
interfere
,
taking
the
side
of
the
little
ones
and
lecturing
the
*NL*
big
.
If
his
daughter
said
,
in
her
thick
,
comfortable
voice
,
how
glad
she
*NL*
had
been
to
see
us
,
immediately
it
would
seem
as
though
some
elder
and
*NL*
more
sensitive
sister
,
latent
in
her
,
had
blushed
at
this
thoughtless
,
*NL*
schoolboyish
utterance
,
which
had
,
perhaps
,
made
us
think
that
she
was
*NL*
angling
for
an
invitation
to
the
house
.
Her
father
would
then
arrange
*NL*
a
cloak
over
her
shoulders
,
they
would
clamber
into
a
little
dog-cart
*NL*
which
she
herself
drove
,
and
home
they
would
both
go
to
Montjouvain
.
*NL*
As
for
ourselves
,
the
next
day
being
Sunday
,
with
no
need
to
be
up
and
*NL*
stirring
before
high
mass
,
if
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
warm
,
then
,
*NL*
instead
of
taking
us
home
at
once
,
my
father
,
in
his
thirst
for
personal
*NL*
distinction
,
would
lead
us
on
a
long
walk
round
by
the
Calvary
,
which
my
*NL*
mother
's
utter
incapacity
for
taking
her
bearings
,
or
even
for
knowing
*NL*
which
road
she
might
be
on
,
made
her
regard
as
a
triumph
of
his
*NL*
strategic
genius
.
Sometimes
we
would
go
as
far
as
the
viaduct
,
which
*NL*
began
to
stride
on
its
long
legs
of
stone
at
the
railway
station
,
and
*NL*
to
me
typified
all
the
wretchedness
of
exile
beyond
the
last
outposts
of
*NL*
civilisation
,
because
every
year
,
as
we
came
down
from
Paris
,
we
would
*NL*
be
warned
to
take
special
care
,
when
we
got
to
Combray
,
not
to
miss
*NL*
the
station
,
to
be
ready
before
the
train
stopped
,
since
it
would
start
*NL*
again
in
two
minutes
and
proceed
across
the
viaduct
,
out
of
the
lands
of
*NL*
Christendom
,
of
which
Combray
,
to
me
,
represented
the
farthest
limit
.
*NL*
We
would
return
by
the
Boulevard
de
la
Gare
,
which
contained
the
most
*NL*
attractive
villas
in
the
town
.
In
each
of
their
gardens
the
moonlight
,
*NL*
copying
the
art
of
Hubert
Robert
,
had
scattered
its
broken
staircases
*NL*
of
white
marble
,
its
fountains
of
water
and
gates
temptingly
ajar
.
Its
*NL*
beams
had
swept
away
the
telegraph
office
.
All
that
was
left
of
it
was
*NL*
a
column
,
half
shattered
,
but
preserving
the
beauty
of
a
ruin
which
*NL*
endures
for
all
time
.
I
would
by
now
be
dragging
my
weary
limbs
,
and
*NL*
ready
to
drop
with
sleep
;
the
balmy
scent
of
the
lime-trees
seemed
a
*NL*
consolation
which
I
could
obtain
only
at
the
price
of
great
suffering
*NL*
and
exhaustion
,
and
not
worthy
of
the
effort
.
From
gates
far
apart
*NL*
the
watchdogs
,
awakened
by
our
steps
in
the
silence
,
would
set
up
*NL*
an
antiphonal
barking
,
as
I
still
hear
them
bark
,
at
times
,
in
the
*NL*
evenings
,
and
it
is
in
their
custody
-LRB-
when
the
public
gardens
of
Combray
*NL*
were
constructed
on
its
site
-RRB-
that
the
Boulevard
de
la
Gare
must
*NL*
have
taken
refuge
,
for
wherever
I
may
be
,
as
soon
as
they
begin
their
*NL*
alternate
challenge
and
acceptance
,
I
can
see
it
again
with
all
its
*NL*
lime-trees
,
and
its
pavement
glistening
beneath
the
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
my
father
would
bring
us
to
a
standstill
and
ask
my
*NL*
mother
--
``
Where
are
we
?
''
Utterly
worn
out
by
the
walk
but
still
proud
of
*NL*
her
husband
,
she
would
lovingly
confess
that
she
had
not
the
least
*NL*
idea
.
He
would
shrug
his
shoulders
and
laugh
.
And
then
,
as
though
it
had
*NL*
slipped
,
with
his
latchkey
,
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
he
would
point
*NL*
out
to
us
,
when
it
stood
before
our
eyes
,
the
back-gate
of
our
own
*NL*
garden
,
which
had
come
hand-in-hand
with
the
familiar
corner
of
the
Rue
*NL*
du
Saint-Esprit
,
to
await
us
,
to
greet
us
at
the
end
of
our
wanderings
*NL*
over
paths
unknown
.
My
mother
would
murmur
admiringly
``
You
really
are
*NL*
wonderful
!
''
And
from
that
instant
I
had
not
to
take
another
step
;
the
*NL*
ground
moved
forward
under
my
feet
in
that
garden
where
,
for
so
long
,
*NL*
my
actions
had
ceased
to
require
any
control
,
or
even
attention
,
from
my
*NL*
will
.
Custom
came
to
take
me
in
her
arms
,
carried
me
all
the
way
up
to
*NL*
my
bed
,
and
laid
me
down
there
like
a
little
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Saturday
,
by
beginning
an
hour
earlier
,
and
by
depriving
her
*NL*
of
the
services
of
Françoise
,
passed
more
slowly
than
other
days
for
my
*NL*
aunt
,
yet
,
the
moment
it
was
past
,
and
a
new
week
begun
,
she
would
look
*NL*
forward
with
impatience
to
its
return
,
as
something
that
embodied
all
*NL*
the
novelty
and
distraction
which
her
frail
and
disordered
body
was
*NL*
still
able
to
endure
.
This
was
not
to
say
,
however
,
that
she
did
not
*NL*
long
,
at
times
,
for
some
even
greater
variation
,
that
she
did
not
*NL*
pass
through
those
abnormal
hours
in
which
one
thirsts
for
something
*NL*
different
from
what
one
has
,
when
those
people
who
,
through
lack
of
*NL*
energy
or
imagination
,
are
unable
to
generate
any
motive
power
in
*NL*
themselves
,
cry
out
,
as
the
clock
strikes
or
the
postman
knocks
,
in
*NL*
their
eagerness
for
news
-LRB-
even
if
it
be
bad
news
-RRB-
,
for
some
emotion
*NL*
-LRB-
even
that
of
grief
-RRB-
;
when
the
heartstrings
,
which
prosperity
has
*NL*
silenced
,
like
a
harp
laid
by
,
yearn
to
be
plucked
and
sounded
again
*NL*
by
some
hand
,
even
a
brutal
hand
,
even
if
it
shall
break
them
;
when
*NL*
the
will
,
which
has
with
such
difficulty
brought
itself
to
subdue
its
*NL*
impulse
,
to
renounce
its
right
to
abandon
itself
to
its
own
uncontrolled
*NL*
desires
,
and
consequent
sufferings
,
would
fain
cast
its
guiding
reins
*NL*
into
the
hands
of
circumstances
,
coercive
and
,
it
may
be
,
cruel
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
since
my
aunt
's
strength
,
which
was
completely
drained
by
the
*NL*
slightest
exertion
,
returned
but
drop
by
drop
into
the
pool
of
her
*NL*
repose
,
the
reservoir
was
very
slow
in
filling
,
and
months
would
go
by
*NL*
before
she
reached
that
surplus
which
other
people
use
up
in
their
daily
*NL*
activities
,
but
which
she
had
no
idea
--
and
could
never
decide
how
to
*NL*
employ
.
And
I
have
no
doubt
that
then
--
just
as
a
desire
to
have
her
*NL*
potatoes
served
with
béchamel
sauce
,
for
a
change
,
would
be
formed
,
*NL*
ultimately
,
from
the
pleasure
she
found
in
the
daily
reappearance
of
*NL*
those
mashed
potatoes
of
which
she
was
never
`
tired
'
--
she
would
extract
*NL*
from
the
accumulation
of
those
monotonous
days
-LRB-
on
which
she
so
much
*NL*
depended
-RRB-
a
keen
expectation
of
some
domestic
cataclysm
,
instantaneous
*NL*
in
its
happening
,
but
violent
enough
to
compel
her
to
put
into
effect
,
*NL*
once
for
all
,
one
of
those
changes
which
she
knew
would
be
beneficial
to
*NL*
her
health
,
but
to
which
she
could
never
make
up
her
mind
without
some
*NL*
such
stimulus
.
She
was
genuinely
fond
of
us
;
she
would
have
enjoyed
the
*NL*
long
luxury
of
weeping
for
our
untimely
decease
;
coming
at
a
moment
when
*NL*
she
felt
`
well
'
and
was
not
in
a
perspiration
,
the
news
that
the
house
*NL*
was
being
destroyed
by
a
fire
,
in
which
all
the
rest
of
us
had
already
*NL*
perished
,
a
fire
which
,
in
a
little
while
,
would
not
leave
one
stone
*NL*
standing
upon
another
,
but
from
which
she
herself
would
still
have
*NL*
plenty
of
time
to
escape
without
undue
haste
,
provided
that
she
rose
*NL*
at
once
from
her
bed
,
must
often
have
haunted
her
dreams
,
as
a
prospect
*NL*
which
combined
with
the
two
minor
advantages
of
letting
her
taste
the
*NL*
full
savour
of
her
affection
for
us
in
long
years
of
mourning
,
and
of
*NL*
causing
universal
stupefaction
in
the
village
when
she
should
sally
*NL*
forth
to
conduct
our
obsequies
,
crushed
but
courageous
,
moribund
but
*NL*
erect
,
the
paramount
and
priceless
boon
of
forcing
her
at
the
right
*NL*
moment
,
with
no
time
to
be
lost
,
no
room
for
weakening
hesitations
,
to
*NL*
go
off
and
spend
the
summer
at
her
charming
farm
of
Mirougrain
,
where
*NL*
there
was
a
waterfall
.
Inasmuch
as
nothing
of
this
sort
had
ever
*NL*
occurred
,
though
indeed
she
must
often
have
pondered
the
success
of
*NL*
such
a
manoeuvre
as
she
lay
alone
absorbed
in
her
interminable
games
of
*NL*
patience
-LRB-
and
though
it
must
have
plunged
her
in
despair
from
the
first
*NL*
moment
of
its
realisation
,
from
the
first
of
those
little
unforeseen
*NL*
facts
,
the
first
word
of
calamitous
news
,
whose
accents
can
never
*NL*
afterwards
be
expunged
from
the
memory
,
everything
that
bears
upon
it
*NL*
the
imprint
of
actual
,
physical
death
,
so
terribly
different
from
the
*NL*
logical
abstraction
of
its
possibility
-RRB-
she
would
fall
back
from
time
*NL*
to
time
,
to
add
an
interest
to
her
life
,
upon
imagining
other
,
minor
*NL*
catastrophes
,
which
she
would
follow
up
with
passion
.
She
would
beguile
*NL*
herself
with
a
sudden
suspicion
that
Françoise
had
been
robbing
her
,
*NL*
that
she
had
set
a
trap
to
make
certain
,
and
had
caught
her
betrayer
*NL*
red-handed
;
and
being
in
the
habit
,
when
she
made
up
a
game
of
cards
by
*NL*
herself
,
of
playing
her
own
and
her
adversary
's
hands
at
once
,
she
would
*NL*
first
stammer
out
Françoise
's
awkward
apologies
,
and
then
reply
to
them
*NL*
with
such
a
fiery
indignation
that
any
of
us
who
happened
to
intrude
*NL*
upon
her
at
one
of
these
moments
would
find
her
bathed
in
perspiration
,
*NL*
her
eyes
blazing
,
her
false
hair
pushed
awry
and
exposing
the
baldness
*NL*
of
her
brows
.
Françoise
must
often
,
from
the
next
room
,
have
heard
these
*NL*
mordant
sarcasms
levelled
at
herself
,
the
mere
framing
of
which
in
words
*NL*
would
not
have
relieved
my
aunt
's
feelings
sufficiently
,
had
they
been
*NL*
allowed
to
remain
in
a
purely
immaterial
form
,
without
the
degree
*NL*
of
substance
and
reality
which
she
added
to
them
by
murmuring
them
*NL*
half-aloud
.
Sometimes
,
however
,
even
these
counterpane
dramas
would
not
*NL*
satisfy
my
aunt
;
she
must
see
her
work
staged
.
And
so
,
on
a
Sunday
,
*NL*
with
all
the
doors
mysteriously
closed
,
she
would
confide
in
Eulalie
her
*NL*
doubts
of
Françoise
's
integrity
and
her
determination
to
be
rid
of
her
,
*NL*
and
on
another
day
she
would
confide
in
Françoise
her
suspicions
of
the
*NL*
disloyalty
of
Eulalie
,
to
whom
the
front-door
would
very
soon
be
closed
*NL*
for
good
.
A
few
days
more
,
and
,
disgusted
with
her
latest
confidant
,
she
*NL*
would
again
be
`
as
thick
as
thieves
'
with
the
traitor
,
while
,
before
the
*NL*
next
performance
,
the
two
would
once
more
have
changed
their
parts
.
But
*NL*
the
suspicions
which
Eulalie
might
occasionally
breed
in
her
were
no
*NL*
more
than
a
fire
of
straw
,
which
must
soon
subside
for
lack
of
fuel
,
*NL*
since
Eulalie
was
not
living
with
her
in
the
house
.
It
was
a
very
*NL*
different
matter
when
the
suspect
was
Françoise
,
of
whose
presence
under
*NL*
the
same
roof
as
herself
my
aunt
was
perpetually
conscious
,
while
for
*NL*
fear
of
catching
cold
,
were
she
to
leave
her
bed
,
she
would
never
dare
*NL*
go
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
to
see
for
herself
whether
there
was
,
*NL*
indeed
,
any
foundation
for
her
suspicions
.
And
so
on
by
degrees
,
until
*NL*
her
mind
had
no
other
occupation
than
to
attempt
,
at
every
hour
of
the
*NL*
day
,
to
discover
what
was
being
done
,
what
was
being
concealed
from
her
*NL*
by
Françoise
.
She
would
detect
the
most
furtive
movement
of
Françoise
's
*NL*
features
,
something
contradictory
in
what
she
was
saying
,
some
desire
*NL*
which
she
appeared
to
be
screening
.
And
she
would
shew
her
that
she
was
*NL*
unmasked
,
by
,
a
single
word
,
which
made
Françoise
turn
pale
,
and
which
*NL*
my
aunt
seemed
to
find
a
cruel
satisfaction
in
driving
into
her
unhappy
*NL*
servant
's
heart
.
And
the
very
next
Sunday
a
disclosure
by
Eulalie
--
like
*NL*
one
of
those
discoveries
which
suddenly
open
up
an
unsuspected
field
*NL*
for
exploration
to
some
new
science
which
has
hitherto
followed
only
*NL*
the
beaten
paths
--
proved
to
my
aunt
that
her
own
worst
suspicions
fell
*NL*
a
long
way
short
of
the
appalling
truth
.
``
But
Françoise
ought
to
know
*NL*
that
,
''
said
Eulalie
,
``
now
that
you
have
given
her
a
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
I
have
given
her
a
carriage
!
''
gasped
my
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
did
n't
know
;
I
only
thought
so
;
I
saw
her
go
by
yesterday
in
*NL*
her
open
coach
,
as
proud
as
Artaban
,
on
her
way
to
Roussainville
market
.
*NL*
I
supposed
that
it
must
be
Mme.
Octave
who
had
given
it
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
on
by
degrees
,
until
Françoise
and
my
aunt
,
the
quarry
and
the
*NL*
hunter
,
could
never
cease
from
trying
to
forestall
each
other
's
devices
.
*NL*
My
mother
was
afraid
lest
Françoise
should
develop
a
genuine
hatred
of
*NL*
my
aunt
,
who
was
doing
everything
in
her
power
to
annoy
her
.
However
*NL*
that
might
be
,
Françoise
had
come
,
more
and
more
,
to
pay
an
infinitely
*NL*
scrupulous
attention
to
my
aunt
's
least
word
and
gesture
.
When
she
had
*NL*
to
ask
her
for
anything
she
would
hesitate
,
first
,
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
making
up
her
mind
how
best
to
begin
.
And
when
she
had
uttered
her
*NL*
request
,
she
would
watch
my
aunt
covertly
,
trying
to
guess
from
the
*NL*
expression
on
her
face
what
she
thought
of
it
,
and
how
she
would
reply
.
*NL*
And
in
this
way
--
whereas
an
artist
who
had
been
reading
memoirs
of
the
*NL*
seventeenth
century
,
and
wished
to
bring
himself
nearer
to
the
great
*NL*
Louis
,
would
consider
that
he
was
making
progress
in
that
direction
when
*NL*
he
constructed
a
pedigree
that
traced
his
own
descent
from
some
historic
*NL*
family
,
or
when
he
engaged
in
correspondence
with
one
of
the
reigning
*NL*
Sovereigns
of
Europe
,
and
so
would
shut
his
eyes
to
the
mistake
he
was
*NL*
making
in
seeking
to
establish
a
similarity
by
an
exact
and
therefore
*NL*
lifeless
copy
of
mere
outward
forms
--
a
middle-aged
lady
in
a
small
*NL*
country
town
,
by
doing
no
more
than
yield
whole-hearted
obedience
to
her
*NL*
own
irresistible
eccentricities
,
and
to
a
spirit
of
mischief
engendered
*NL*
by
the
utter
idleness
of
her
existence
,
could
see
,
without
ever
having
*NL*
given
a
thought
to
Louis
XIV
,
the
most
trivial
occupations
of
her
daily
*NL*
life
,
her
morning
toilet
,
her
luncheon
,
her
afternoon
nap
,
assume
,
by
*NL*
virtue
of
their
despotic
singularity
,
something
of
the
interest
that
was
*NL*
to
be
found
in
what
Saint-Simon
used
to
call
the
`
machinery
'
of
life
at
*NL*
Versailles
;
and
was
able
,
too
,
to
persuade
herself
that
her
silence
,
*NL*
a
shade
of
good
humour
or
of
arrogance
on
her
features
,
would
provide
*NL*
Françoise
with
matter
for
a
mental
commentary
as
tense
with
passion
and
*NL*
terror
,
as
did
the
silence
,
the
good
humour
or
the
arrogance
of
the
King
*NL*
when
a
courtier
,
or
even
his
greatest
nobles
,
had
presented
a
petition
*NL*
to
him
,
at
the
turning
of
an
avenue
,
at
Versailles
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Sunday
,
when
my
aunt
had
received
simultaneous
visits
from
the
Curé
*NL*
and
from
Eulalie
,
and
had
been
left
alone
,
afterwards
,
to
rest
,
the
*NL*
whole
family
went
upstairs
to
bid
her
good
night
,
and
Mamma
ventured
*NL*
to
condole
with
her
on
the
unlucky
coincidence
that
always
brought
both
*NL*
visitors
to
her
door
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
that
things
went
wrong
again
to-day
,
Léonie
,
''
she
said
kindly
,
*NL*
``
you
have
had
all
your
friends
here
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
my
great-aunt
interrupted
with
:
``
Too
many
good
things
...
''
for
,
since
*NL*
her
daughter
's
illness
,
she
felt
herself
in
duty
bound
to
revive
her
as
*NL*
far
as
possible
by
always
drawing
her
attention
to
the
brighter
side
of
*NL*
things
.
But
my
father
had
begun
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
take
advantage
,
''
he
said
,
``
of
the
whole
family
's
being
*NL*
here
together
,
to
tell
you
a
story
,
so
as
not
to
have
to
begin
all
over
*NL*
again
to
each
of
you
separately
.
I
am
afraid
we
are
in
M.
Legrandin
's
*NL*
bad
books
;
he
would
hardly
say
`
How
d'ye
do
'
to
me
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
wait
to
hear
the
end
of
my
father
's
story
,
for
I
had
been
with
*NL*
him
myself
after
mass
when
we
had
passed
M.
Legrandin
;
instead
,
I
went
*NL*
downstairs
to
the
kitchen
to
ask
for
the
bill
of
fare
for
our
dinner
,
*NL*
which
was
of
fresh
interest
to
me
daily
,
like
the
news
in
a
paper
,
and
*NL*
excited
me
as
might
the
programme
of
a
coming
festivity
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
M.
Legrandin
had
passed
close
by
us
on
our
way
from
church
,
*NL*
walking
by
the
side
of
a
lady
,
the
owner
of
a
country
house
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
whom
we
knew
only
by
sight
,
my
father
had
saluted
him
in
*NL*
a
manner
at
once
friendly
and
reserved
,
without
stopping
in
his
walk
;
M.
*NL*
Legrandin
had
barely
acknowledged
the
courtesy
,
and
then
with
an
air
of
*NL*
surprise
,
as
though
he
had
not
recognised
us
,
and
with
that
distant
look
*NL*
characteristic
of
people
who
do
not
wish
to
be
agreeable
,
and
who
from
*NL*
the
suddenly
receding
depths
of
their
eyes
seem
to
have
caught
sight
of
*NL*
you
at
the
far
end
of
an
interminably
straight
road
,
and
at
so
great
*NL*
a
distance
that
they
content
themselves
with
directing
towards
you
*NL*
an
almost
imperceptible
movement
of
the
head
,
in
proportion
to
your
*NL*
doll-like
dimensions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
lady
who
was
walking
with
Legrandin
was
a
model
of
virtue
,
*NL*
known
and
highly
respected
;
there
could
be
no
question
of
his
being
*NL*
out
for
amorous
adventure
,
and
annoyed
at
being
detected
;
and
my
father
*NL*
asked
himself
how
he
could
possibly
have
displeased
our
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
all
the
more
sorry
to
feel
that
he
was
angry
with
us
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
because
among
all
those
people
in
their
Sunday
clothes
there
*NL*
is
something
about
him
,
with
his
little
cut-away
coat
and
his
soft
*NL*
neckties
,
so
little
`
dressed-up
,
'
so
genuinely
simple
;
an
air
of
*NL*
innocence
,
almost
,
which
is
really
attractive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
vote
of
the
family
council
was
unanimous
,
that
my
father
had
*NL*
imagined
the
whole
thing
,
or
that
Legrandin
,
at
the
moment
in
question
,
*NL*
had
been
preoccupied
in
thinking
about
something
else
.
Anyhow
,
my
*NL*
father
's
fears
were
dissipated
no
later
than
the
following
evening
.
*NL*
As
we
returned
from
a
long
walk
we
saw
,
near
the
Pont-Vieux
,
Legrandin
*NL*
himself
,
who
,
on
account
of
the
holidays
,
was
spending
a
few
days
more
*NL*
in
Combray
.
He
came
up
to
us
with
outstretched
hand
:
``
Do
you
know
,
*NL*
master
book-lover
,
''
he
asked
me
,
``
this
line
of
Paul
Desjardins
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
are
the
woods
all
black
,
but
still
the
sky
is
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
not
that
a
fine
rendering
of
a
moment
like
this
?
Perhaps
you
have
*NL*
never
read
Paul
Desjardins
.
Read
him
,
my
boy
,
read
him
;
in
these
days
he
*NL*
is
converted
,
they
tell
me
,
into
a
preaching
friar
,
but
he
used
to
have
*NL*
the
most
charming
water-colour
touch
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
are
the
woods
all
black
,
but
still
the
sky
is
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
you
always
see
a
blue
sky
overhead
,
my
young
friend
;
and
then
,
even
*NL*
when
the
time
comes
,
which
is
coming
now
for
me
,
when
the
woods
are
all
*NL*
black
,
when
night
is
fast
falling
,
you
will
be
able
to
console
yourself
,
*NL*
as
I
am
doing
,
by
looking
up
to
the
sky
.
''
He
took
a
cigarette
from
*NL*
his
pocket
and
stood
for
a
long
time
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
horizon
.
*NL*
``
Goodbye
,
friends
!
''
he
suddenly
exclaimed
,
and
left
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
hour
when
I
usually
went
downstairs
to
find
out
what
there
was
*NL*
for
dinner
,
its
preparation
would
already
have
begun
,
and
Françoise
,
*NL*
a
colonel
with
all
the
forces
of
nature
for
her
subalterns
,
as
in
the
*NL*
fairy-tales
where
giants
hire
themselves
out
as
scullions
,
would
be
*NL*
stirring
the
coals
,
putting
the
potatoes
to
steam
,
and
,
at
the
right
*NL*
moment
,
finishing
over
the
fire
those
culinary
masterpieces
which
had
*NL*
been
first
got
ready
in
some
of
the
great
array
of
vessels
,
triumphs
of
*NL*
the
potter
's
craft
,
which
ranged
from
tubs
and
boilers
and
cauldrons
*NL*
and
fish
kettles
down
to
jars
for
game
,
moulds
for
pastry
,
and
tiny
*NL*
pannikins
for
cream
,
and
included
an
entire
collection
of
pots
and
*NL*
pans
of
every
shape
and
size
.
I
would
stop
by
the
table
,
where
the
*NL*
kitchen-maid
had
shelled
them
,
to
inspect
the
platoons
of
peas
,
drawn
up
*NL*
in
ranks
and
numbered
,
like
little
green
marbles
,
ready
for
a
game
;
but
*NL*
what
fascinated
me
would
be
the
asparagus
,
tinged
with
ultramarine
*NL*
and
rosy
pink
which
ran
from
their
heads
,
finely
stippled
in
mauve
and
*NL*
azure
,
through
a
series
of
imperceptible
changes
to
their
white
*NL*
feet
,
still
stained
a
little
by
the
soil
of
their
garden-bed
:
a
*NL*
rainbow-loveliness
that
was
not
of
this
world
.
I
felt
that
these
*NL*
celestial
hues
indicated
the
presence
of
exquisite
creatures
who
had
*NL*
been
pleased
to
assume
vegetable
form
,
who
,
through
the
disguise
which
*NL*
covered
their
firm
and
edible
flesh
,
allowed
me
to
discern
in
this
*NL*
radiance
of
earliest
dawn
,
these
hinted
rainbows
,
these
blue
evening
*NL*
shades
,
that
precious
quality
which
I
should
recognise
again
when
,
all
*NL*
night
long
after
a
dinner
at
which
I
had
partaken
of
them
,
they
played
*NL*
-LRB-
lyrical
and
coarse
in
their
jesting
as
the
fairies
in
Shakespeare
's
*NL*
_
Dream
_
-RRB-
at
transforming
my
humble
chamber
into
a
bower
of
aromatic
*NL*
perfume
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Giotto
's
Charity
,
as
Swann
had
named
her
,
charged
by
Françoise
with
*NL*
the
task
of
preparing
them
for
the
table
,
would
have
them
lying
beside
*NL*
her
in
a
basket
;
sitting
with
a
mournful
air
,
as
though
all
the
sorrows
*NL*
of
the
world
were
heaped
upon
her
;
and
the
light
crowns
of
azure
which
*NL*
capped
the
asparagus
shoots
above
their
pink
jackets
would
be
finely
and
*NL*
separately
outlined
,
star
by
star
,
as
in
Giotto
's
fresco
are
the
flowers
*NL*
banded
about
the
brows
,
or
patterning
the
basket
of
his
Virtue
at
Padua
.
*NL*
And
,
meanwhile
,
Françoise
would
be
turning
on
the
spit
one
of
those
*NL*
chickens
,
such
as
she
alone
knew
how
to
roast
,
chickens
which
had
wafted
*NL*
far
abroad
from
Combray
the
sweet
savour
of
her
merits
,
and
which
,
while
*NL*
she
was
serving
them
to
us
at
table
,
would
make
the
quality
of
kindness
*NL*
predominate
for
the
moment
in
my
private
conception
of
her
character
;
*NL*
the
aroma
of
that
cooked
flesh
,
which
she
knew
how
to
make
so
unctuous
*NL*
and
so
tender
,
seeming
to
me
no
more
than
the
proper
perfume
of
one
of
*NL*
her
many
virtues
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
day
on
which
,
while
my
father
took
counsel
with
his
family
upon
*NL*
our
strange
meeting
with
Legrandin
,
I
went
down
to
the
kitchen
,
was
one
*NL*
of
those
days
when
Giotto
's
Charity
,
still
very
weak
and
ill
after
her
*NL*
recent
confinement
,
had
been
unable
to
rise
from
her
bed
;
Françoise
,
*NL*
being
without
assistance
,
had
fallen
into
arrears
.
When
I
went
in
,
I
saw
*NL*
her
in
the
back-kitchen
which
opened
on
to
the
courtyard
,
in
process
of
*NL*
killing
a
chicken
;
by
its
desperate
and
quite
natural
resistance
,
which
*NL*
Françoise
,
beside
herself
with
rage
as
she
attempted
to
slit
its
throat
*NL*
beneath
the
ear
,
accompanied
with
shrill
cries
of
``
Filthy
creature
!
*NL*
Filthy
creature
!
''
it
made
the
saintly
kindness
and
unction
of
our
*NL*
servant
rather
less
prominent
than
it
would
do
,
next
day
at
dinner
,
when
*NL*
it
made
its
appearance
in
a
skin
gold-embroidered
like
a
chasuble
,
and
*NL*
its
precious
juice
was
poured
out
drop
by
drop
as
from
a
pyx
.
When
it
*NL*
was
dead
Françoise
mopped
up
its
streaming
blood
,
in
which
,
however
,
*NL*
she
did
not
let
her
rancour
drown
,
for
she
gave
vent
to
another
burst
*NL*
of
rage
,
and
,
gazing
down
at
the
carcass
of
her
enemy
,
uttered
a
final
*NL*
``
Filthy
creature
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
crept
out
of
the
kitchen
and
upstairs
,
trembling
all
over
;
I
could
*NL*
have
prayed
,
then
,
for
the
instant
dismissal
of
Françoise
.
But
who
*NL*
would
have
baked
me
such
hot
rolls
,
boiled
me
such
fragrant
coffee
,
and
*NL*
even
--
roasted
me
such
chickens
?
And
,
as
it
happened
,
everyone
else
had
*NL*
already
had
to
make
the
same
cowardly
reckoning
.
For
my
aunt
Léonie
knew
*NL*
-LRB-
though
I
was
still
in
ignorance
of
this
-RRB-
that
Françoise
,
who
,
for
her
*NL*
own
daughter
or
for
her
nephews
,
would
have
given
her
life
without
a
*NL*
murmur
,
shewed
a
singular
implacability
in
her
dealings
with
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
world
.
In
spite
of
which
my
aunt
still
retained
her
,
for
,
while
*NL*
conscious
of
her
cruelty
,
she
could
appreciate
her
services
.
I
began
*NL*
gradually
to
realise
that
Françoise
's
kindness
,
her
compunction
,
the
*NL*
sum
total
of
her
virtues
concealed
many
of
these
back-kitchen
tragedies
,
*NL*
just
as
history
reveals
to
us
that
the
reigns
of
the
kings
and
queens
*NL*
who
are
portrayed
as
kneeling
with
clasped
hands
in
the
windows
of
*NL*
churches
,
were
stained
by
oppression
and
bloodshed
.
I
had
taken
note
of
*NL*
the
fact
that
,
apart
from
her
own
kinsfolk
,
the
sufferings
of
humanity
*NL*
inspired
in
her
a
pity
which
increased
in
direct
ratio
to
the
distance
*NL*
separating
the
sufferers
from
herself
.
The
tears
which
flowed
from
her
*NL*
in
torrents
when
she
read
of
the
misfortunes
of
persons
unknown
to
her
,
*NL*
in
a
newspaper
,
were
quickly
stemmed
once
she
had
been
able
to
form
a
*NL*
more
accurate
mental
picture
of
the
victims
.
One
night
,
shortly
after
*NL*
her
confinement
,
the
kitchen-maid
was
seized
with
the
most
appalling
*NL*
pains
;
Mamma
heard
her
groans
,
and
rose
and
awakened
Françoise
,
who
,
*NL*
quite
unmoved
,
declared
that
all
the
outcry
was
mere
malingering
,
that
*NL*
the
girl
wanted
to
`
play
the
mistress
'
in
the
house
.
The
doctor
,
who
*NL*
had
been
afraid
of
some
such
attack
,
had
left
a
marker
in
a
medical
*NL*
dictionary
which
we
had
,
at
the
page
on
which
the
symptoms
were
*NL*
described
,
and
had
told
us
to
turn
up
this
passage
,
where
we
would
find
*NL*
the
measures
of
`
first
aid
'
to
be
adopted
.
My
mother
sent
Françoise
*NL*
to
fetch
the
book
,
warning
her
not
to
let
the
marker
drop
out
.
An
hour
*NL*
elapsed
,
and
Françoise
had
not
returned
;
my
mother
,
supposing
that
*NL*
she
had
gone
back
to
bed
,
grew
vexed
,
and
told
me
to
go
myself
to
the
*NL*
bookcase
and
fetch
the
volume
.
I
did
so
,
and
there
found
Françoise
who
,
*NL*
in
her
curiosity
to
know
what
the
marker
indicated
,
had
begun
to
read
*NL*
the
clinical
account
of
these
after-pains
,
and
was
violently
sobbing
,
*NL*
now
that
it
was
a
question
of
a
type
of
illness
with
which
she
was
not
*NL*
familiar
.
At
each
painful
symptom
mentioned
by
the
writer
she
would
*NL*
exclaim
:
``
Oh
,
oh
,
Holy
Virgin
,
is
it
possible
that
God
wishes
any
*NL*
wretched
human
creature
to
suffer
so
?
Oh
,
the
poor
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
I
had
called
her
,
and
she
had
returned
to
the
bedside
of
*NL*
Giotto
's
Charity
,
her
tears
at
once
ceased
to
flow
;
she
could
find
no
*NL*
stimulus
for
that
pleasant
sensation
of
tenderness
and
pity
which
she
*NL*
very
well
knew
,
having
been
moved
to
it
often
enough
by
the
perusal
*NL*
of
newspapers
;
nor
any
other
pleasure
of
the
same
kind
in
her
sense
of
*NL*
weariness
and
irritation
at
being
pulled
out
of
bed
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
night
for
the
kitchen-maid
;
so
that
at
the
sight
of
those
very
*NL*
sufferings
,
the
printed
account
of
which
had
moved
her
to
tears
,
she
*NL*
had
nothing
to
offer
but
ill-tempered
mutterings
,
mingled
with
bitter
*NL*
sarcasm
,
saying
,
when
she
thought
that
we
had
gone
out
of
earshot
:
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
need
never
have
done
what
she
must
have
done
to
bring
all
*NL*
this
about
!
She
found
that
pleasant
enough
,
I
dare
say
!
She
had
better
*NL*
not
put
on
any
airs
now
.
All
the
same
,
he
must
have
been
a
god-forsaken
*NL*
young
man
to
go
after
_
that
_
.
Dear
,
dear
,
it
's
just
as
they
used
to
say
*NL*
in
my
poor
mother
's
country
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Snaps
and
snails
and
puppy-dogs
'
tails
,
*NL*
And
dirty
sluts
in
plenty
,
*NL*
Smell
sweeter
than
roses
in
young
men
's
noses
*NL*
When
the
heart
is
one-and-twenty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Although
,
when
her
grandson
had
a
slight
cold
in
his
head
,
she
would
set
*NL*
off
at
night
,
even
if
she
were
ill
also
,
instead
of
going
to
bed
,
to
*NL*
see
whether
he
had
everything
that
he
wanted
,
covering
ten
miles
on
foot
*NL*
before
daybreak
so
as
to
be
in
time
to
begin
her
work
,
this
same
love
*NL*
for
her
own
people
,
and
her
desire
to
establish
the
future
greatness
of
*NL*
her
house
on
a
solid
foundation
reacted
,
in
her
policy
with
regard
to
*NL*
the
other
servants
,
in
one
unvarying
maxim
,
which
was
never
to
let
any
*NL*
of
them
set
foot
in
my
aunt
's
room
;
indeed
she
shewed
a
sort
of
pride
*NL*
in
not
allowing
anyone
else
to
come
near
my
aunt
,
preferring
,
when
she
*NL*
herself
was
ill
,
to
get
out
of
bed
and
to
administer
the
Vichy
water
in
*NL*
person
,
rather
than
to
concede
to
the
kitchen-maid
the
right
of
entry
*NL*
into
her
mistress
's
presence
.
There
is
a
species
of
hymenoptera
,
*NL*
observed
by
Fabre
,
the
burrowing
wasp
,
which
in
order
to
provide
a
*NL*
supply
of
fresh
meat
for
her
offspring
after
her
own
decease
,
calls
*NL*
in
the
science
of
anatomy
to
amplify
the
resources
of
her
instinctive
*NL*
cruelty
,
and
,
having
made
a
collection
of
weevils
and
spiders
,
proceeds
*NL*
with
marvellous
knowledge
and
skill
to
pierce
the
nerve-centre
on
which
*NL*
their
power
of
locomotion
-LRB-
but
none
of
their
other
vital
functions
-RRB-
*NL*
depends
,
so
that
the
paralysed
insect
,
beside
which
her
egg
is
laid
,
*NL*
will
furnish
the
larva
,
when
it
is
hatched
,
with
a
tamed
and
inoffensive
*NL*
quarry
,
incapable
either
of
flight
or
of
resistance
,
but
perfectly
fresh
*NL*
for
the
larder
:
in
the
same
way
Françoise
had
adopted
,
to
minister
*NL*
to
her
permanent
and
unfaltering
resolution
to
render
the
house
*NL*
uninhabitable
to
any
other
servant
,
a
series
of
crafty
and
pitiless
*NL*
stratagems
.
Many
years
later
we
discovered
that
,
if
we
had
been
fed
on
*NL*
asparagus
day
after
day
throughout
that
whole
season
,
it
was
because
the
*NL*
smell
of
the
plants
gave
the
poor
kitchen-maid
,
who
had
to
prepare
them
,
*NL*
such
violent
attacks
of
asthma
that
she
was
finally
obliged
to
leave
my
*NL*
aunt
's
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
we
had
definitely
to
alter
our
opinion
of
M.
Legrandin
.
On
one
*NL*
of
the
Sundays
following
our
meeting
with
him
on
the
Pont-Vieux
,
after
*NL*
which
my
father
had
been
forced
to
confess
himself
mistaken
,
as
mass
*NL*
drew
to
an
end
,
and
,
with
the
sunshine
and
the
noise
of
the
outer
world
,
*NL*
something
else
invaded
the
church
,
an
atmosphere
so
far
from
sacred
that
*NL*
Mme.
Goupil
,
Mme.
Percepied
-LRB-
all
those
,
in
fact
,
who
a
moment
ago
,
when
*NL*
I
arrived
a
little
late
,
had
been
sitting
motionless
,
their
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
their
prayer-books
;
who
,
I
might
even
have
thought
,
had
not
seen
*NL*
me
come
in
,
had
not
their
feet
moved
slightly
to
push
away
the
little
*NL*
kneeling-desk
which
was
preventing
me
from
getting
to
my
chair
-RRB-
began
in
*NL*
loud
voices
to
discuss
with
us
all
manner
of
utterly
mundane
topics
,
as
*NL*
though
we
were
already
outside
in
the
Square
,
we
saw
,
standing
on
the
*NL*
sun-baked
steps
of
the
porch
,
dominating
the
many-coloured
tumult
of
the
*NL*
market
,
Legrandin
himself
,
whom
the
husband
of
the
lady
we
had
seen
with
*NL*
him
,
on
the
previous
occasion
,
was
just
going
to
introduce
to
the
wife
*NL*
of
another
large
landed
proprietor
of
the
district
.
Legrandin
's
face
*NL*
shewed
an
extraordinary
zeal
and
animation
;
he
made
a
profound
bow
,
with
*NL*
a
subsidiary
backward
movement
which
brought
his
spine
sharply
up
into
a
*NL*
position
behind
its
starting-point
,
a
gesture
in
which
he
must
have
*NL*
been
trained
by
the
husband
of
his
sister
,
Mme.
de
Cambremer
.
This
rapid
*NL*
recovery
caused
a
sort
of
tense
muscular
wave
to
ripple
over
Legrandin
's
*NL*
hips
,
which
I
had
not
supposed
to
be
so
fleshy
;
I
can
not
say
why
,
but
*NL*
this
undulation
of
pure
matter
,
this
wholly
carnal
fluency
,
with
not
the
*NL*
least
hint
in
it
of
spiritual
significance
,
this
wave
lashed
to
a
fury
*NL*
by
the
wind
of
an
assiduity
,
an
obsequiousness
of
the
basest
sort
,
awoke
*NL*
my
mind
suddenly
to
the
possibility
of
a
Legrandin
altogether
different
*NL*
from
the
one
whom
we
knew
.
The
lady
gave
him
some
message
for
her
*NL*
coachman
,
and
while
he
was
stepping
down
to
her
carriage
the
impression
*NL*
of
joy
,
timid
and
devout
,
which
the
introduction
had
stamped
there
,
*NL*
still
lingered
on
his
face
.
Carried
away
in
a
sort
of
dream
,
he
smiled
,
*NL*
then
he
began
to
hurry
back
towards
the
lady
;
he
was
walking
faster
than
*NL*
usual
,
and
his
shoulders
swayed
backwards
and
forwards
,
right
and
left
,
*NL*
in
the
most
absurd
fashion
;
altogether
he
looked
,
so
utterly
had
he
*NL*
abandoned
himself
to
it
,
ignoring
all
other
considerations
,
as
though
he
*NL*
were
the
lifeless
and
wire-pulled
puppet
of
his
own
happiness
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
we
were
coming
out
through
the
porch
;
we
were
passing
close
beside
him
;
*NL*
he
was
too
well
bred
to
turn
his
head
away
;
but
he
fixed
his
eyes
,
which
*NL*
had
suddenly
changed
to
those
of
a
seer
,
lost
in
the
profundity
of
his
*NL*
vision
,
on
so
distant
a
point
of
the
horizon
that
he
could
not
see
us
,
*NL*
and
so
had
not
to
acknowledge
our
presence
.
His
face
emerged
,
still
with
*NL*
an
air
of
innocence
,
from
his
straight
and
pliant
coat
,
which
looked
*NL*
as
though
conscious
of
having
been
led
astray
,
in
spite
of
itself
,
*NL*
and
plunged
into
surroundings
of
a
detested
splendour
.
And
a
spotted
*NL*
necktie
,
stirred
by
the
breezes
of
the
Square
,
continued
to
float
in
*NL*
front
of
Legrandin
,
like
the
standard
of
his
proud
isolation
,
of
his
*NL*
noble
independence
.
Just
as
we
reached
the
house
my
mother
discovered
*NL*
that
we
had
forgotten
the
`
Saint-Honoré
,
'
and
asked
my
father
to
go
*NL*
back
with
me
and
tell
them
to
send
it
up
at
once
.
Near
the
church
we
met
*NL*
Legrandin
,
coming
towards
us
with
the
same
lady
,
whom
he
was
escorting
*NL*
to
her
carriage
.
He
brushed
past
us
,
and
did
not
interrupt
what
he
was
*NL*
saying
to
her
,
but
gave
us
,
out
of
the
corner
of
his
blue
eye
,
a
little
*NL*
sign
,
which
began
and
ended
,
so
to
speak
,
inside
his
eyelids
,
and
as
*NL*
it
did
not
involve
the
least
movement
of
his
facial
muscles
,
managed
to
*NL*
pass
quite
unperceived
by
the
lady
;
but
,
striving
to
compensate
by
the
*NL*
intensity
of
his
feelings
for
the
somewhat
restricted
field
in
which
*NL*
they
had
to
find
expression
,
he
made
that
blue
chink
,
which
was
set
*NL*
apart
for
us
,
sparkle
with
all
the
animation
of
cordiality
,
which
went
*NL*
far
beyond
mere
playfulness
,
and
almost
touched
the
border-line
of
*NL*
roguery
;
he
subtilised
the
refinements
of
good-fellowship
into
a
wink
*NL*
of
connivance
,
a
hint
,
a
hidden
meaning
,
a
secret
understanding
,
all
the
*NL*
mysteries
of
complicity
in
a
plot
,
and
finally
exalted
his
assurances
*NL*
of
friendship
to
the
level
of
protestations
of
affection
,
even
of
a
*NL*
declaration
of
love
,
lighting
up
for
us
,
and
for
us
alone
,
with
a
secret
*NL*
and
languid
flame
invisible
by
the
great
lady
upon
his
other
side
,
an
*NL*
enamoured
pupil
in
a
countenance
of
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
day
before
he
had
asked
my
parents
to
send
me
to
dine
with
him
*NL*
on
this
same
Sunday
evening
.
``
Come
and
bear
your
aged
friend
company
,
''
*NL*
he
had
said
to
me
.
``
Like
the
nosegay
which
a
traveller
sends
us
from
*NL*
some
land
to
which
we
shall
never
go
again
,
come
and
let
me
breathe
from
*NL*
the
far
country
of
your
adolescence
the
scent
of
those
flowers
of
*NL*
spring
among
which
I
also
used
to
wander
,
many
years
ago
.
Come
with
*NL*
the
primrose
,
with
the
canon
's
beard
,
with
the
gold-cup
;
come
with
the
*NL*
stone-crop
,
whereof
are
posies
made
,
pledges
of
love
,
in
the
Balzacian
*NL*
flora
,
come
with
that
flower
of
the
Resurrection
morning
,
the
Easter
*NL*
daisy
,
come
with
the
snowballs
of
the
guelder-rose
,
which
begin
to
*NL*
embalm
with
their
fragrance
the
alleys
of
your
great-aunt
's
garden
ere
*NL*
the
last
snows
of
Lent
are
melted
from
its
soil
.
Come
with
the
glorious
*NL*
silken
raiment
of
the
lily
,
apparel
fit
for
Solomon
,
and
with
the
*NL*
many-coloured
enamel
of
the
pansies
,
but
come
,
above
all
,
with
the
*NL*
spring
breeze
,
still
cooled
by
the
last
frosts
of
winter
,
wafting
apart
,
*NL*
for
the
two
butterflies
'
sake
,
that
have
waited
outside
all
morning
,
the
*NL*
closed
portals
of
the
first
Jerusalem
rose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
was
raised
at
home
whether
,
all
things
considered
,
I
ought
*NL*
still
to
be
sent
to
dine
with
M.
Legrandin
.
But
my
grandmother
refused
*NL*
to
believe
that
he
could
have
been
impolite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
admit
yourself
that
he
appears
at
church
there
,
quite
simply
*NL*
dressed
,
and
all
that
;
he
hardly
looks
like
a
man
of
fashion
.
''
She
added
*NL*
that
;
in
any
event
,
even
if
,
at
the
worst
,
he
had
been
intentionally
*NL*
rude
,
it
was
far
better
for
us
to
pretend
that
we
had
noticed
nothing
.
*NL*
And
indeed
my
father
himself
,
though
more
annoyed
than
any
of
us
by
the
*NL*
attitude
which
Legrandin
had
adopted
,
may
still
have
held
in
reserve
a
*NL*
final
uncertainty
as
to
its
true
meaning
.
It
was
like
every
attitude
*NL*
or
action
which
reveals
a
man
's
deep
and
hidden
character
;
they
bear
*NL*
no
relation
to
what
he
has
previously
said
,
and
we
can
not
confirm
our
*NL*
suspicions
by
the
culprit
's
evidence
,
for
he
will
admit
nothing
;
we
are
*NL*
reduced
to
the
evidence
of
our
own
senses
,
and
we
ask
ourselves
,
in
the
*NL*
face
of
this
detached
and
incoherent
fragment
of
recollection
,
whether
*NL*
indeed
our
senses
have
not
been
the
victims
of
a
hallucination
;
with
*NL*
the
result
that
such
attitudes
,
and
these
alone
are
of
importance
in
*NL*
indicating
character
,
are
the
most
apt
to
leave
us
in
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dined
with
Legrandin
on
the
terrace
of
his
house
,
by
moonlight
.
``
There
*NL*
is
a
charming
quality
,
is
there
not
,
''
he
said
to
me
,
``
in
this
silence
;
*NL*
for
hearts
that
are
wounded
,
as
mine
is
,
a
novelist
,
whom
you
will
read
*NL*
in
time
to
come
,
claims
that
there
is
no
remedy
but
silence
and
shadow
.
*NL*
And
see
you
this
,
my
boy
,
there
comes
in
all
lives
a
time
,
towards
which
*NL*
you
still
have
far
to
go
,
when
the
weary
eyes
can
endure
but
one
kind
of
*NL*
light
,
the
light
which
a
fine
evening
like
this
prepares
for
us
in
the
*NL*
stillroom
of
darkness
,
when
the
ears
can
listen
to
no
music
save
what
*NL*
the
moonlight
breathes
through
the
flute
of
silence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hear
what
M.
Legrandin
was
saying
;
like
everything
that
he
said
,
*NL*
it
sounded
attractive
;
but
I
was
disturbed
by
the
memory
of
a
lady
whom
*NL*
I
had
seen
recently
for
the
first
time
;
and
thinking
,
now
that
I
*NL*
knew
that
Legrandin
was
on
friendly
terms
with
several
of
the
local
*NL*
aristocracy
,
that
perhaps
she
also
was
among
his
acquaintance
,
I
*NL*
summoned
up
all
my
courage
and
said
to
him
:
``
Tell
me
,
sir
,
do
you
,
by
*NL*
any
chance
,
know
the
lady
--
the
ladies
of
Guermantes
?
''
and
I
felt
glad
*NL*
because
,
in
pronouncing
the
name
,
I
had
secured
a
sort
of
power
over
*NL*
it
,
by
the
mere
act
of
drawing
it
up
out
of
my
dreams
and
giving
it
an
*NL*
objective
existence
in
the
world
of
spoken
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
at
the
sound
of
the
word
Guermantes
,
I
saw
in
the
middle
of
each
of
*NL*
our
friend
's
blue
eyes
a
little
brown
dimple
appear
,
as
though
they
had
*NL*
been
stabbed
by
some
invisible
pin-point
,
while
the
rest
of
his
pupils
,
*NL*
reacting
from
the
shock
,
received
and
secreted
the
azure
overflow
.
*NL*
His
fringed
eyelids
darkened
,
and
drooped
.
His
mouth
,
which
had
been
*NL*
stiffened
and
seared
with
bitter
lines
,
was
the
first
to
recover
,
and
*NL*
smiled
,
while
his
eyes
still
seemed
full
of
pain
,
like
the
eyes
of
a
*NL*
good-looking
martyr
whose
body
bristles
with
arrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
know
them
,
''
he
said
,
but
instead
of
uttering
so
simple
a
*NL*
piece
of
information
,
a
reply
in
which
there
was
so
little
that
could
*NL*
astonish
me
,
in
the
natural
and
conversational
tone
which
would
have
*NL*
befitted
it
,
he
recited
it
with
a
separate
stress
upon
each
word
,
*NL*
leaning
forward
,
bowing
his
head
,
with
at
once
the
vehemence
which
a
man
*NL*
gives
,
so
as
to
be
believed
,
to
a
highly
improbable
statement
-LRB-
as
though
*NL*
the
fact
that
he
did
not
know
the
Guermantes
could
be
due
only
to
some
*NL*
strange
accident
of
fortune
-RRB-
and
with
the
emphasis
of
a
man
who
,
finding
*NL*
himself
unable
to
keep
silence
about
what
is
to
him
a
painful
situation
,
*NL*
chooses
to
proclaim
it
aloud
,
so
as
to
convince
his
hearers
that
the
*NL*
confession
he
is
making
is
one
that
causes
him
no
embarrassment
,
but
is
*NL*
easy
,
agreeable
,
spontaneous
,
that
the
situation
in
question
,
in
this
*NL*
case
the
absence
of
relations
with
the
Guermantes
family
,
might
very
*NL*
well
have
been
not
forced
upon
,
but
actually
designed
by
Legrandin
*NL*
himself
,
might
arise
from
some
family
tradition
,
some
moral
principle
or
*NL*
mystical
vow
which
expressly
forbade
his
seeking
their
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
resumed
,
explaining
by
his
words
the
tone
in
which
they
were
*NL*
uttered
.
``
No
,
I
do
not
know
them
;
I
have
never
wished
to
know
them
;
I
*NL*
have
always
made
a
point
of
preserving
complete
independence
;
at
heart
,
*NL*
as
you
know
,
I
am
a
bit
of
a
Radical
.
People
are
always
coming
to
me
*NL*
about
it
,
telling
me
I
am
mistaken
in
not
going
to
Guermantes
,
that
I
*NL*
make
myself
seem
ill-bred
,
uncivilised
,
an
old
bear
.
But
that
's
not
the
*NL*
sort
of
reputation
that
can
frighten
me
;
it
's
too
true
!
In
my
heart
*NL*
of
hearts
I
care
for
nothing
in
the
world
now
but
a
few
churches
,
*NL*
books
--
two
or
three
,
pictures
--
rather
more
,
perhaps
,
and
the
light
of
*NL*
the
moon
when
the
fresh
breeze
of
youth
-LRB-
such
as
yours
-RRB-
wafts
to
my
*NL*
nostrils
the
scent
of
gardens
whose
flowers
my
old
eyes
are
not
sharp
*NL*
enough
,
now
,
to
distinguish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
understand
very
clearly
why
,
in
order
to
refrain
from
going
*NL*
to
the
houses
of
people
whom
one
did
not
know
,
it
should
be
necessary
to
*NL*
cling
to
one
's
independence
,
nor
how
that
could
give
one
the
appearance
*NL*
of
a
savage
or
a
bear
.
But
what
I
did
understand
was
this
,
that
*NL*
Legrandin
was
not
altogether
truthful
when
he
said
that
he
cared
only
*NL*
for
churches
,
moonlight
,
and
youth
;
he
cared
also
,
he
cared
a
very
*NL*
great
deal
,
for
people
who
lived
in
country
houses
,
and
would
be
so
much
*NL*
afraid
,
when
in
their
company
,
of
incurring
their
displeasure
that
he
*NL*
would
never
dare
to
let
them
see
that
he
numbered
,
as
well
,
among
*NL*
his
friends
middle-class
people
,
the
families
of
solicitors
and
*NL*
stockbrokers
,
preferring
,
if
the
truth
must
be
known
,
that
it
should
*NL*
be
revealed
in
his
absence
,
when
he
was
out
of
earshot
,
that
judgment
*NL*
should
go
against
him
-LRB-
if
so
it
must
-RRB-
by
default
:
in
a
word
,
he
was
a
*NL*
snob
.
Of
course
he
would
never
have
admitted
all
or
any
of
this
in
the
*NL*
poetical
language
which
my
family
and
I
so
much
admired
.
And
if
I
asked
*NL*
him
,
``
Do
you
know
the
Guermantes
family
?
''
Legrandin
the
talker
would
*NL*
reply
,
``
No
,
I
have
never
cared
to
know
them
.
''
But
unfortunately
the
*NL*
talker
was
now
subordinated
to
another
Legrandin
,
whom
he
kept
carefully
*NL*
hidden
in
his
breast
,
whom
he
would
never
consciously
exhibit
,
because
*NL*
this
other
could
tell
stories
about
our
own
Legrandin
and
about
his
*NL*
snobbishness
which
would
have
ruined
his
reputation
for
ever
;
and
this
*NL*
other
Legrandin
had
replied
to
me
already
in
that
wounded
look
,
that
*NL*
stiffened
smile
,
the
undue
gravity
of
his
tone
in
uttering
those
*NL*
few
words
,
in
the
thousand
arrows
by
which
our
own
Legrandin
had
*NL*
instantaneously
been
stabbed
and
sickened
,
like
a
Saint
Sebastian
of
*NL*
snobbery
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
you
hurt
me
!
No
,
I
do
not
know
the
Guermantes
family
.
Do
not
*NL*
remind
me
of
the
great
sorrow
of
my
life
.
''
And
since
this
other
,
*NL*
this
irrepressible
,
dominant
,
despotic
Legrandin
,
if
he
lacked
our
*NL*
Legrandin
's
charming
vocabulary
,
shewed
an
infinitely
greater
promptness
*NL*
in
expressing
himself
,
by
means
of
what
are
called
`
reflexes
,
'
it
*NL*
followed
that
,
when
Legrandin
the
talker
attempted
to
silence
him
,
he
*NL*
would
already
have
spoken
,
and
it
would
be
useless
for
our
friend
to
*NL*
deplore
the
bad
impression
which
the
revelations
of
his
_
alter
ego
_
must
*NL*
have
caused
,
since
he
could
do
no
more
now
than
endeavour
to
mitigate
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
to
say
that
M.
Legrandin
was
anything
but
sincere
when
he
*NL*
inveighed
against
snobs
.
He
could
not
-LRB-
from
his
own
knowledge
,
at
least
-RRB-
*NL*
be
aware
that
he
was
one
also
,
since
it
is
only
with
the
passions
of
*NL*
others
that
we
are
ever
really
familiar
,
and
what
we
come
to
find
out
*NL*
about
our
own
can
be
no
more
than
what
other
people
have
shewn
us
.
Upon
*NL*
ourselves
they
react
but
indirectly
,
through
our
imagination
,
which
*NL*
substitutes
for
our
actual
,
primary
motives
other
,
secondary
motives
,
*NL*
less
stark
and
therefore
more
decent
.
Never
had
Legrandin
's
snobbishness
*NL*
impelled
him
to
make
a
habit
of
visiting
a
duchess
as
such
.
Instead
,
it
*NL*
would
set
his
imagination
to
make
that
duchess
appear
,
in
Legrandin
's
*NL*
eyes
,
endowed
with
all
the
graces
.
He
would
be
drawn
towards
the
*NL*
duchess
,
assuring
himself
the
while
that
he
was
yielding
to
the
*NL*
attractions
of
her
mind
,
and
her
other
virtues
,
which
the
vile
race
of
*NL*
snobs
could
never
understand
.
Only
his
fellow-snobs
knew
that
he
was
*NL*
of
their
number
,
for
,
owing
to
their
inability
to
appreciate
the
*NL*
intervening
efforts
of
his
imagination
,
they
saw
in
close
juxtaposition
*NL*
the
social
activities
of
Legrandin
and
their
primary
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
home
,
meanwhile
,
we
had
no
longer
any
illusions
as
to
M.
Legrandin
,
*NL*
and
our
relations
with
him
had
become
much
more
distant
.
Mamma
would
be
*NL*
greatly
delighted
whenever
she
caught
him
red-handed
in
the
sin
,
which
*NL*
he
continued
to
call
the
unpardonable
sin
,
of
snobbery
.
As
for
my
*NL*
father
,
he
found
it
difficult
to
take
Legrandin
's
airs
in
so
light
,
in
*NL*
so
detached
a
spirit
;
and
when
there
was
some
talk
,
one
year
,
of
sending
*NL*
me
to
spend
the
long
summer
holidays
at
Balbec
with
my
grandmother
,
*NL*
he
said
:
``
I
must
,
most
certainly
,
tell
Legrandin
that
you
are
going
to
*NL*
Balbec
,
to
see
whether
he
will
offer
you
an
introduction
to
his
sister
.
*NL*
He
probably
does
n't
remember
telling
us
that
she
lived
within
a
mile
of
*NL*
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
grandmother
,
who
held
that
,
when
one
went
to
the
seaside
,
one
ought
*NL*
to
be
on
the
beach
from
morning
to
night
,
to
taste
the
salt
breezes
,
and
*NL*
that
one
should
not
know
anyone
in
the
place
,
because
calls
and
parties
*NL*
and
excursions
were
so
much
time
stolen
from
what
belonged
,
by
rights
,
*NL*
to
the
sea-air
,
begged
him
on
no
account
to
speak
to
Legrandin
of
our
*NL*
plans
;
for
already
,
in
her
mind
's
eye
,
she
could
see
his
sister
,
Mme.
de
*NL*
Cambremer
,
alighting
from
her
carriage
at
the
door
of
our
hotel
just
*NL*
as
we
were
on
the
point
of
going
out
fishing
,
and
obliging
us
to
remain
*NL*
indoors
all
afternoon
to
entertain
her
.
But
Mamma
laughed
her
fears
to
*NL*
scorn
,
for
she
herself
felt
that
the
danger
was
not
so
threatening
,
and
*NL*
that
Legrandin
would
shew
no
undue
anxiety
to
make
us
acquainted
with
*NL*
his
sister
.
And
,
as
it
happened
,
there
was
no
need
for
any
of
us
to
*NL*
introduce
the
subject
of
Balbec
,
for
it
was
Legrandin
himself
who
,
*NL*
without
the
least
suspicion
that
we
had
ever
had
any
intention
of
*NL*
visiting
those
parts
,
walked
into
the
trap
uninvited
one
evening
,
when
*NL*
we
met
him
strolling
on
the
banks
of
the
Vivonne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
tints
in
the
clouds
this
evening
,
violets
and
blues
,
which
*NL*
are
very
beautiful
,
are
they
not
,
my
friend
?
''
he
said
to
my
father
.
*NL*
``
Especially
a
blue
which
is
far
more
floral
than
atmospheric
,
a
*NL*
cineraria
blue
,
which
it
is
surprising
to
see
in
the
sky
.
And
that
*NL*
little
pink
cloud
there
,
has
it
not
just
the
tint
of
some
flower
,
a
*NL*
carnation
or
hydrangea
?
Nowhere
,
perhaps
,
except
on
the
shores
of
the
*NL*
English
Channel
,
where
Normandy
merges
into
Brittany
,
have
I
been
able
*NL*
to
find
such
copious
examples
of
what
you
might
call
a
vegetable
kingdom
*NL*
in
the
clouds
.
Down
there
,
close
to
Balbec
,
among
all
those
places
which
*NL*
are
still
so
uncivilised
,
there
is
a
little
bay
,
charmingly
quiet
,
where
*NL*
the
sunsets
of
the
Auge
Valley
,
those
red-and-gold
sunsets
-LRB-
which
,
*NL*
all
the
same
,
I
am
very
far
from
despising
-RRB-
seem
commonplace
and
*NL*
insignificant
;
for
in
that
moist
and
gentle
atmosphere
these
heavenly
*NL*
flower-beds
will
break
into
blossom
,
in
a
few
moments
,
in
the
evenings
,
*NL*
incomparably
lovely
,
and
often
lasting
for
hours
before
they
fade
.
*NL*
Others
shed
their
leaves
at
once
,
and
then
it
is
more
beautiful
still
*NL*
to
see
the
sky
strewn
with
the
scattering
of
their
innumerable
petals
,
*NL*
sulphurous
yellow
and
rosy
red
.
In
that
bay
,
which
they
call
the
Opal
*NL*
Bay
,
the
golden
sands
appear
more
charming
still
from
being
fastened
,
*NL*
like
fair
Andromeda
,
to
those
terrible
rocks
of
the
surrounding
coast
,
*NL*
to
that
funereal
shore
,
famed
for
the
number
of
its
wrecks
,
where
every
*NL*
winter
many
a
brave
vessel
falls
a
victim
to
the
perils
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
Balbec
!
the
oldest
bone
in
the
geological
skeleton
that
underlies
our
*NL*
soil
,
the
true
Armor
,
the
sea
,
the
land
's
end
,
the
accursed
region
*NL*
which
Anatole
France
--
an
enchanter
whose
works
our
young
friend
ought
to
*NL*
read
--
has
so
well
depicted
,
beneath
its
eternal
fogs
,
as
though
it
were
*NL*
indeed
the
land
of
the
Cimmerians
in
the
Odyssey
.
Balbec
;
yes
,
they
*NL*
are
building
hotels
there
now
,
superimposing
them
upon
its
ancient
and
*NL*
charming
soil
,
which
they
are
powerless
to
alter
;
how
delightful
it
is
,
*NL*
down
there
,
to
be
able
to
step
out
at
once
into
regions
so
primitive
and
*NL*
so
entrancing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
And
do
you
know
anyone
at
Balbec
?
''
inquired
my
father
.
``
This
*NL*
young
man
is
just
going
to
spend
a
couple
of
months
there
with
his
*NL*
grandmother
,
and
my
wife
too
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Legrandin
,
taken
unawares
by
the
question
at
a
moment
when
he
was
*NL*
looking
directly
at
my
father
,
was
unable
to
turn
aside
his
gaze
,
and
so
*NL*
concentrated
it
with
steadily
increasing
intensity
--
smiling
mournfully
*NL*
the
while
--
upon
the
eyes
of
his
questioner
,
with
an
air
of
friendliness
*NL*
and
frankness
and
of
not
being
afraid
to
look
him
in
the
face
,
until
he
*NL*
seemed
to
have
penetrated
my
father
's
skull
,
as
it
had
been
a
ball
of
*NL*
glass
,
and
to
be
seeing
,
at
the
moment
,
a
long
way
beyond
and
behind
it
,
*NL*
a
brightly
coloured
cloud
,
which
provided
him
with
a
mental
alibi
,
and
*NL*
would
enable
him
to
establish
the
theory
that
,
just
when
he
was
*NL*
being
asked
whether
he
knew
anyone
at
Balbec
,
he
had
been
thinking
*NL*
of
something
else
,
and
so
had
not
heard
the
question
.
As
a
rule
these
*NL*
tactics
make
the
questioner
proceed
to
ask
,
``
Why
,
what
are
you
thinking
*NL*
about
?
''
But
my
father
,
inquisitive
,
annoyed
,
and
cruel
,
repeated
:
``
Have
*NL*
you
friends
,
then
,
in
that
neighbourhood
,
that
you
know
Balbec
so
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
final
and
desperate
effort
the
smiling
gaze
of
Legrandin
struggled
*NL*
to
the
extreme
limits
of
its
tenderness
,
vagueness
,
candour
,
and
*NL*
distraction
;
then
feeling
,
no
doubt
,
that
there
was
nothing
left
for
it
*NL*
now
but
to
answer
,
he
said
to
us
:
``
I
have
friends
all
the
world
over
,
*NL*
wherever
there
are
companies
of
trees
,
stricken
but
not
defeated
,
*NL*
which
have
come
together
to
offer
a
common
supplication
,
with
pathetic
*NL*
obstinacy
,
to
an
inclement
sky
which
has
no
mercy
upon
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
quite
what
I
meant
,
''
interrupted
my
father
,
obstinate
as
*NL*
a
tree
and
merciless
as
the
sky
.
``
I
asked
you
,
in
case
anything
should
*NL*
happen
to
my
mother-in-law
and
she
wanted
to
feel
that
she
was
not
all
*NL*
alone
down
there
,
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
whether
you
knew
any
of
the
*NL*
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
as
elsewhere
,
I
know
everyone
and
I
know
no
one
,
''
replied
*NL*
Legrandin
,
who
was
by
no
means
ready
yet
to
surrender
;
``
places
I
know
*NL*
well
,
people
very
slightly
.
But
,
down
there
,
the
places
themselves
seem
*NL*
to
me
just
like
people
,
rare
and
wonderful
people
,
of
a
delicate
quality
*NL*
which
would
have
been
corrupted
and
ruined
by
the
gift
of
life
.
Perhaps
*NL*
it
is
a
castle
which
you
encounter
upon
the
cliff
's
edge
;
standing
there
*NL*
by
the
roadside
,
where
it
has
halted
to
contemplate
its
sorrows
before
*NL*
an
evening
sky
,
still
rosy
,
through
which
a
golden
moon
is
climbing
;
*NL*
while
the
fishing-boats
,
homeward
bound
,
creasing
the
watered
silk
of
*NL*
the
Channel
,
hoist
its
pennant
at
their
mastheads
and
carry
its
colours
.
*NL*
Or
perhaps
it
is
a
simple
dwelling-house
that
stands
alone
,
ugly
,
if
*NL*
anything
,
timid-seeming
but
full
of
romance
,
hiding
from
every
eye
some
*NL*
imperishable
secret
of
happiness
and
disenchantment
.
That
land
which
*NL*
knows
not
truth
,
''
he
continued
with
Machiavellian
subtlety
,
``
that
land
*NL*
of
infinite
fiction
makes
bad
reading
for
any
boy
;
and
is
certainly
*NL*
not
what
I
should
choose
or
recommend
for
my
young
friend
here
,
who
is
*NL*
already
so
much
inclined
to
melancholy
,
for
a
heart
already
predisposed
*NL*
to
receive
its
impressions
.
Climates
that
breathe
amorous
secrets
and
*NL*
futile
regrets
may
agree
with
an
old
and
disillusioned
man
like
myself
;
*NL*
but
they
must
always
prove
fatal
to
a
temperament
which
is
still
*NL*
unformed
.
Believe
me
,
''
he
went
on
with
emphasis
,
``
the
waters
of
that
*NL*
bay
--
more
Breton
than
Norman
--
may
exert
a
sedative
influence
,
though
*NL*
even
that
is
of
questionable
value
,
upon
a
heart
which
,
like
mine
,
is
no
*NL*
longer
unbroken
,
a
heart
for
whose
wounds
there
is
no
longer
anything
*NL*
to
compensate
.
But
at
your
age
,
my
boy
,
those
waters
are
*NL*
contra-indicated
...
Good
night
to
you
,
neighbours

''
he
added
,
moving
*NL*
away
from
us
with
that
evasive
abruptness
to
which
we
were
accustomed
;
*NL*
and
then
,
turning
towards
us
,
with
a
physicianly
finger
raised
in
*NL*
warning
,
he
resumed
the
consultation
:
``
No
Balbec
before
you
are
fifty
!
''
*NL*
he
called
out
to
me
,
``
and
even
then
it
must
depend
on
the
state
of
the
*NL*
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
spoke
to
him
of
it
again
,
as
often
as
we
met
him
,
and
tortured
*NL*
him
with
questions
,
but
it
was
labour
in
vain
:
like
that
scholarly
*NL*
swindler
who
devoted
to
the
fabrication
of
forged
palimpsests
a
wealth
*NL*
of
skill
and
knowledge
and
industry
the
hundredth
part
of
which
would
*NL*
have
sufficed
to
establish
him
in
a
more
lucrative
--
but
an
honourable
*NL*
occupation
,
M.
Legrandin
,
had
we
insisted
further
,
would
in
the
end
have
*NL*
constructed
a
whole
system
of
ethics
,
and
a
celestial
geography
of
Lower
*NL*
Normandy
,
sooner
than
admit
to
us
that
,
within
a
mile
of
Balbec
,
his
own
*NL*
sister
was
living
in
her
own
house
;
sooner
than
find
himself
obliged
*NL*
to
offer
us
a
letter
of
introduction
,
the
prospect
of
which
would
never
*NL*
have
inspired
him
with
such
terror
had
he
been
absolutely
certain
--
as
,
*NL*
from
his
knowledge
of
my
grandmother
's
character
,
he
really
ought
to
*NL*
have
been
certain
--
that
in
no
circumstances
whatsoever
would
we
have
*NL*
dreamed
of
making
use
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
We
used
always
to
return
from
our
walks
in
good
time
to
pay
aunt
Léonie
*NL*
a
visit
before
dinner
.
In
the
first
weeks
of
our
Combray
holidays
,
when
*NL*
the
days
ended
early
,
we
would
still
be
able
to
see
,
as
we
turned
*NL*
into
the
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
,
a
reflection
of
the
western
sky
from
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
house
and
a
band
of
purple
at
the
foot
of
the
Calvary
,
*NL*
which
was
mirrored
further
on
in
the
pond
;
a
fiery
glow
which
,
*NL*
accompanied
often
by
a
cold
that
burned
and
stung
,
would
associate
*NL*
itself
in
my
mind
with
the
glow
of
the
fire
over
which
,
at
that
very
*NL*
moment
,
was
roasting
the
chicken
that
was
to
furnish
me
,
in
place
of
the
*NL*
poetic
pleasure
I
had
found
in
my
walk
,
with
the
sensual
pleasures
of
*NL*
good
feeding
,
warmth
and
rest
.
But
in
summer
,
when
we
came
back
to
the
*NL*
house
,
the
sun
would
not
have
set
;
and
while
we
were
upstairs
paying
our
*NL*
visit
to
aunt
Léonie
its
rays
,
sinking
until
they
touched
and
lay
along
*NL*
her
window-sill
,
would
there
be
caught
and
held
by
the
large
inner
*NL*
curtains
and
the
bands
which
tied
them
back
to
the
wall
,
and
split
and
*NL*
scattered
and
filtered
;
and
then
,
at
last
,
would
fall
upon
and
inlay
*NL*
with
tiny
flakes
of
gold
the
lemonwood
of
her
chest-of-drawers
,
*NL*
illuminating
the
room
in
their
passage
with
the
same
delicate
,
slanting
,
*NL*
shadowed
beams
that
fall
among
the
boles
of
forest
trees
.
But
on
some
*NL*
days
,
though
very
rarely
,
the
chest-of-drawers
would
long
since
have
*NL*
shed
its
momentary
adornments
,
there
would
no
longer
,
as
we
turned
into
*NL*
the
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
,
be
any
reflection
from
the
western
sky
burning
*NL*
along
the
line
of
window-panes
;
the
pond
beneath
the
Calvary
would
*NL*
have
lost
its
fiery
glow
,
sometimes
indeed
had
changed
already
to
an
*NL*
opalescent
pallor
,
while
a
long
ribbon
of
moonlight
,
bent
and
broken
*NL*
and
broadened
by
every
ripple
upon
the
water
's
surface
,
would
be
lying
*NL*
across
it
,
from
end
to
end
.
Then
,
as
we
drew
near
the
house
,
we
would
*NL*
make
out
a
figure
standing
upon
the
doorstep
,
and
Mamma
would
say
to
me
:
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
There
is
Françoise
looking
out
for
us
;
your
aunt
must
be
*NL*
anxious
;
that
means
we
are
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
wasting
time
by
stopping
to
take
off
our
`
things
'
we
would
*NL*
fly
upstairs
to
my
aunt
Léonie
's
room
to
reassure
her
,
to
prove
to
her
*NL*
by
our
bodily
presence
that
all
her
gloomy
imaginings
were
false
,
that
,
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
nothing
had
happened
to
us
,
but
that
we
had
gone
the
*NL*
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
and
,
good
lord
,
when
one
took
that
walk
,
my
aunt
knew
*NL*
well
enough
that
one
could
never
say
at
what
time
one
would
be
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
Françoise
,
''
my
aunt
would
say
,
``
did
n't
I
tell
you
that
they
must
*NL*
have
gone
the
Guermantes
way
?
Good
gracious
!
They
must
be
hungry
!
And
*NL*
your
nice
leg
of
mutton
will
be
quite
dried
up
now
,
after
all
the
hours
*NL*
it
's
been
waiting
.
What
a
time
to
come
in
!
Well
,
and
so
you
went
the
*NL*
Guermantes
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Leonie
,
I
supposed
you
knew
,
''
Mamma
would
answer
.
``
I
thought
*NL*
that
Françoise
had
seen
us
go
out
by
the
little
gate
,
through
the
*NL*
kitchen-garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
there
were
,
in
the
environs
of
Combray
,
two
`
ways
'
which
we
used
to
*NL*
take
for
our
walks
,
and
so
diametrically
opposed
that
we
would
actually
*NL*
leave
the
house
by
a
different
door
,
according
to
the
way
we
had
chosen
:
*NL*
the
way
towards
Méséglise-la-Vineuse
,
which
we
called
also
`
Swann
's
*NL*
way
,
'
because
,
to
get
there
,
one
had
to
pass
along
the
boundary
of
M.
*NL*
Swann
's
estate
,
and
the
`
Guermantes
way
.
'
Of
Méséglise-la-Vineuse
,
to
*NL*
tell
the
truth
,
I
never
knew
anything
more
than
the
way
there
,
and
*NL*
the
strange
people
who
would
come
over
on
Sundays
to
take
the
air
in
*NL*
Combray
,
people
whom
,
this
time
,
neither
my
aunt
nor
any
of
us
would
*NL*
`
know
at
all
,
'
and
whom
we
would
therefore
assume
to
be
`
people
who
must
*NL*
have
come
over
from
Méséglise
.
'
As
for
Guermantes
,
I
was
to
know
it
well
*NL*
enough
one
day
,
but
that
day
had
still
to
come
;
and
,
during
the
whole
*NL*
of
my
boyhood
,
if
Méséglise
was
to
me
something
as
inaccessible
as
the
*NL*
horizon
,
which
remained
hidden
from
sight
,
however
far
one
went
,
by
the
*NL*
folds
of
a
country
which
no
longer
bore
the
least
resemblance
to
the
*NL*
country
round
Combray
;
Guermantes
,
on
the
other
hand
,
meant
no
more
than
*NL*
the
ultimate
goal
,
ideal
rather
than
real
,
of
the
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
a
*NL*
sort
of
abstract
geographical
term
like
the
North
Pole
or
the
Equator
.
*NL*
And
so
to
`
take
the
Guermantes
way
'
in
order
to
get
to
Méséglise
,
or
*NL*
vice
versa
,
would
have
seemed
to
me
as
nonsensical
a
proceeding
as
to
*NL*
turn
to
the
east
in
order
to
reach
the
west
.
Since
my
father
used
always
*NL*
to
speak
of
the
'M
éséglise
way
'
as
comprising
the
finest
view
of
a
plain
*NL*
that
he
knew
anywhere
,
and
of
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
as
typical
of
river
*NL*
scenery
,
I
had
invested
each
of
them
,
by
conceiving
them
in
this
way
as
*NL*
two
distinct
entities
,
with
that
cohesion
,
that
unity
which
belongs
*NL*
only
to
the
figments
of
the
mind
;
the
smallest
detail
of
either
of
*NL*
them
appeared
to
me
as
a
precious
thing
,
which
exhibited
the
special
*NL*
excellence
of
the
whole
,
while
,
immediately
beside
them
,
in
the
first
*NL*
stages
of
our
walk
,
before
we
had
reached
the
sacred
soil
of
one
or
the
*NL*
other
,
the
purely
material
roads
,
at
definite
points
on
which
they
*NL*
were
set
down
as
the
ideal
view
over
a
plain
and
the
ideal
scenery
of
a
*NL*
river
,
were
no
more
worth
the
trouble
of
looking
at
them
than
,
to
a
keen
*NL*
playgoer
and
lover
of
dramatic
art
,
are
the
little
streets
which
may
*NL*
happen
to
run
past
the
walls
of
a
theatre
.
But
,
above
all
,
I
set
between
*NL*
them
,
far
more
distinctly
than
the
mere
distance
in
miles
and
yards
and
*NL*
inches
which
separated
one
from
the
other
,
the
distance
that
there
was
*NL*
between
the
two
parts
of
my
brain
in
which
I
used
to
think
of
them
,
one
*NL*
of
those
distances
of
the
mind
which
time
serves
only
to
lengthen
,
which
*NL*
separate
things
irremediably
from
one
another
,
keeping
them
for
ever
*NL*
upon
different
planes
.
And
this
distinction
was
rendered
still
more
*NL*
absolute
because
the
habit
we
had
of
never
going
both
ways
on
the
same
*NL*
day
,
or
in
the
course
of
the
same
walk
,
but
the
'M
éséglise
way
'
one
time
*NL*
and
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
another
,
shut
them
up
,
so
to
speak
,
far
apart
*NL*
and
unaware
of
each
other
's
existence
,
in
the
sealed
vessels
--
between
*NL*
which
there
could
be
no
communication
--
of
separate
afternoons
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
had
decided
to
go
the
'M
éséglise
way
'
we
would
start
-LRB-
without
*NL*
undue
haste
,
and
even
if
the
sky
were
clouded
over
,
since
the
walk
was
*NL*
not
very
long
,
and
did
not
take
us
too
far
from
home
-RRB-
,
as
though
we
were
*NL*
not
going
anywhere
in
particular
,
by
the
front-door
of
my
aunt
's
house
,
*NL*
which
opened
on
to
the
Rue
du
Saint-Esprit
.
We
would
be
greeted
by
*NL*
the
gunsmith
,
we
would
drop
our
letters
into
the
box
,
we
would
tell
*NL*
Théodore
,
from
Françoise
,
as
we
passed
,
that
she
had
run
out
of
oil
*NL*
or
coffee
,
and
we
would
leave
the
town
by
the
road
which
ran
along
the
*NL*
white
fence
of
M.
Swann
's
park
.
Before
reaching
it
we
would
be
met
on
*NL*
our
way
by
the
scent
of
his
lilac-trees
,
come
out
to
welcome
strangers
.
*NL*
Out
of
the
fresh
little
green
hearts
of
their
foliage
the
lilacs
raised
*NL*
inquisitively
over
the
fence
of
the
park
their
plumes
of
white
or
purple
*NL*
blossom
,
which
glowed
,
even
in
the
shade
,
with
the
sunlight
in
which
*NL*
they
had
been
bathed
.
Some
of
them
,
half-concealed
by
the
little
*NL*
tiled
house
,
called
the
Archers
'
Lodge
,
in
which
Swann
's
keeper
lived
,
*NL*
overtopped
its
gothic
gable
with
their
rosy
minaret
.
The
nymphs
of
*NL*
spring
would
have
seemed
coarse
and
vulgar
in
comparison
with
these
*NL*
young
houris
,
who
retained
,
in
this
French
garden
,
the
pure
and
vivid
*NL*
colouring
of
a
Persian
miniature
.
Despite
my
desire
to
throw
my
arms
*NL*
about
their
pliant
forms
and
to
draw
down
towards
me
the
starry
locks
*NL*
that
crowned
their
fragrant
heads
,
we
would
pass
them
by
without
*NL*
stopping
,
for
my
parents
had
ceased
to
visit
Tansonville
since
Swann
's
*NL*
marriage
,
and
,
so
as
not
to
appear
to
be
looking
into
his
park
,
we
*NL*
would
,
instead
of
taking
the
road
which
ran
beside
its
boundary
and
then
*NL*
climbed
straight
up
to
the
open
fields
,
choose
another
way
,
which
led
in
*NL*
the
same
direction
,
but
circuitously
,
and
brought
us
out
rather
too
far
*NL*
from
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
my
grandfather
said
to
my
`
father
:
``
Do
n't
you
remember
Swann
's
*NL*
telling
us
yesterday
that
his
wife
and
daughter
had
gone
off
to
Rheims
*NL*
and
that
he
was
taking
the
opportunity
of
spending
a
day
or
two
in
*NL*
Paris
?
We
might
go
along
by
the
park
,
since
the
ladies
are
not
at
home
;
*NL*
that
will
make
it
a
little
shorter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
stopped
for
a
moment
by
the
fence
.
Lilac-time
was
nearly
over
;
some
*NL*
of
the
trees
still
thrust
aloft
,
in
tall
purple
chandeliers
,
their
tiny
*NL*
balls
of
blossom
,
but
in
many
places
among
their
foliage
where
,
only
*NL*
a
week
before
,
they
had
still
been
breaking
in
waves
of
fragrant
foam
,
*NL*
these
were
now
spent
and
shrivelled
and
discoloured
,
a
hollow
scum
,
dry
*NL*
and
scentless
.
My
grandfather
pointed
out
to
my
father
in
what
respects
*NL*
the
appearance
of
the
place
was
still
the
same
,
and
how
far
it
had
*NL*
altered
since
the
walk
that
he
had
taken
with
old
M.
Swann
,
on
the
day
*NL*
of
his
wife
's
death
;
and
he
seized
the
opportunity
to
tell
us
,
once
*NL*
again
,
the
story
of
that
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
front
of
us
a
path
bordered
with
nasturtiums
rose
in
the
full
glare
*NL*
of
the
sun
towards
the
house
.
But
to
our
right
the
park
stretched
away
*NL*
into
the
distance
,
on
level
ground
.
Overshadowed
by
the
tall
trees
which
*NL*
stood
close
around
it
,
an
`
ornamental
water
'
had
been
constructed
by
*NL*
Swann
's
parents
but
,
even
in
his
most
artificial
creations
,
nature
is
*NL*
the
material
upon
which
man
has
to
work
;
certain
spots
will
persist
in
*NL*
remaining
surrounded
by
the
vassals
of
their
own
especial
sovereignty
,
*NL*
and
will
raise
their
immemorial
standards
among
all
the
`
laid-out
'
*NL*
scenery
of
a
park
,
just
as
they
would
have
done
far
from
any
human
*NL*
interference
,
in
a
solitude
which
must
everywhere
return
to
engulf
*NL*
them
,
springing
up
out
of
the
necessities
of
their
exposed
position
,
and
*NL*
superimposing
itself
upon
the
work
of
man
's
hands
.
And
so
it
was
that
,
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
path
which
led
down
to
this
artificial
lake
,
there
*NL*
might
be
seen
,
in
its
two
tiers
woven
of
trailing
forget-me-nots
below
*NL*
and
of
periwinkle
flowers
above
,
the
natural
,
delicate
,
blue
garland
*NL*
which
binds
the
luminous
,
shadowed
brows
of
water-nymphs
;
while
the
*NL*
iris
,
its
swords
sweeping
every
way
in
regal
profusion
,
stretched
out
*NL*
over
agrimony
and
water-growing
king-cups
the
lilied
sceptres
,
tattered
*NL*
glories
of
yellow
and
purple
,
of
the
kingdom
of
the
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
absence
of
Mlle.
Swann
,
which
--
since
it
preserved
me
from
the
*NL*
terrible
risk
of
seeing
her
appear
on
one
of
the
paths
,
and
of
being
*NL*
identified
and
scorned
by
this
so
privileged
little
girl
who
had
*NL*
Bergotte
for
a
friend
and
used
to
go
with
him
to
visit
cathedrals
--
made
*NL*
the
exploration
of
Tansonville
,
now
for
the
first
time
permitted
me
,
a
*NL*
matter
of
indifference
to
myself
,
seemed
however
to
invest
the
property
,
*NL*
in
my
grandfather
's
and
father
's
eyes
,
with
a
fresh
and
transient
charm
,
*NL*
and
-LRB-
like
an
entirely
cloudless
sky
when
one
is
going
mountaineering
-RRB-
to
*NL*
make
the
day
extraordinarily
propitious
for
a
walk
in
this
direction
;
*NL*
I
should
have
liked
to
see
their
reckoning
proved
false
,
to
see
,
by
a
*NL*
miracle
,
Mlle.
Swann
appear
,
with
her
father
,
so
close
to
us
that
we
*NL*
should
not
have
time
to
escape
,
and
should
therefore
be
obliged
to
make
*NL*
her
acquaintance
.
And
so
,
when
I
suddenly
noticed
a
straw
basket
lying
*NL*
forgotten
on
the
grass
by
the
side
of
a
line
whose
float
was
bobbing
*NL*
in
the
water
,
I
made
a
great
effort
to
keep
my
father
and
grandfather
*NL*
looking
in
another
direction
,
away
from
this
sign
that
she
might
,
after
*NL*
all
,
be
in
residence
.
Still
,
as
Swann
had
told
us
that
he
ought
not
,
*NL*
really
,
to
go
away
just
then
,
as
he
had
some
people
staying
in
the
*NL*
house
,
the
line
might
equally
belong
to
one
of
these
guests
.
Not
a
*NL*
footstep
was
to
be
heard
on
any
of
the
paths
.
Somewhere
in
one
of
the
*NL*
tall
trees
,
making
a
stage
in
its
height
,
an
invisible
bird
,
desperately
*NL*
attempting
to
make
the
day
seem
shorter
,
was
exploring
with
a
long
,
*NL*
continuous
note
the
solitude
that
pressed
it
on
every
side
,
but
it
*NL*
received
at
once
so
unanimous
an
answer
,
so
powerful
a
repercussion
of
*NL*
silence
and
of
immobility
that
,
one
would
have
said
,
it
had
arrested
*NL*
for
all
eternity
the
moment
which
it
had
been
trying
to
make
pass
more
*NL*
quickly
.
The
sunlight
fell
so
implacably
from
a
fixed
sky
that
one
was
*NL*
naturally
inclined
to
slip
away
out
of
the
reach
of
its
attentions
,
and
*NL*
even
the
slumbering
water
,
whose
repose
was
perpetually
being
invaded
by
*NL*
the
insects
that
swarmed
above
its
surface
,
while
it
dreamed
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
of
some
imaginary
maelstrom
,
intensified
the
uneasiness
which
the
sight
*NL*
of
that
floating
cork
had
wrought
in
me
,
by
appearing
to
draw
it
at
*NL*
full
speed
across
the
silent
reaches
of
a
mirrored
firmament
;
now
almost
*NL*
vertical
,
it
seemed
on
the
point
of
plunging
down
out
of
sight
,
and
*NL*
I
had
begun
to
ask
myself
whether
,
setting
aside
the
longing
and
the
*NL*
terror
that
I
had
of
making
her
acquaintance
,
it
was
not
actually
my
*NL*
duty
to
warn
Mlle.
Swann
that
the
fish
was
biting
--
when
I
was
obliged
*NL*
to
run
after
my
father
and
grandfather
,
who
were
calling
me
,
and
were
*NL*
surprised
that
I
had
not
followed
them
along
the
little
path
,
climbing
*NL*
up
hill
towards
the
open
fields
,
into
which
they
had
already
turned
.
I
*NL*
found
the
whole
path
throbbing
with
the
fragrance
of
hawthorn-blossom
.
*NL*
The
hedge
resembled
a
series
of
chapels
,
whose
walls
were
no
longer
*NL*
visible
under
the
mountains
of
flowers
that
were
heaped
upon
their
*NL*
altars
;
while
underneath
,
the
sun
cast
a
square
of
light
upon
the
*NL*
ground
,
as
though
it
had
shone
in
upon
them
through
a
window
;
the
scent
*NL*
that
swept
out
over
me
from
them
was
as
rich
,
and
as
circumscribed
in
*NL*
its
range
,
as
though
I
had
been
standing
before
the
Lady-altar
,
and
*NL*
the
flowers
,
themselves
adorned
also
,
held
out
each
its
little
bunch
of
*NL*
glittering
stamens
with
an
air
of
inattention
,
fine
,
radiating
`
nerves
'
*NL*
in
the
flamboyant
style
of
architecture
,
like
those
which
,
in
church
,
*NL*
framed
the
stair
to
the
rood-loft
or
closed
the
perpendicular
tracery
*NL*
of
the
windows
,
but
here
spread
out
into
pools
of
fleshy
white
,
like
*NL*
strawberry-beds
in
spring
.
How
simple
and
rustic
,
in
comparison
with
*NL*
these
,
would
seem
the
dog-roses
which
,
in
a
few
weeks
'
time
,
would
be
*NL*
climbing
the
same
hillside
path
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
,
dressed
in
the
*NL*
smooth
silk
of
their
blushing
pink
bodices
,
which
would
be
undone
and
*NL*
scattered
by
the
first
breath
of
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
in
vain
that
I
lingered
before
the
hawthorns
,
to
breathe
in
,
*NL*
to
marshal
before
my
mind
-LRB-
which
knew
not
what
to
make
of
it
-RRB-
,
to
lose
*NL*
in
order
to
rediscover
their
invisible
and
unchanging
odour
,
to
absorb
*NL*
myself
in
the
rhythm
which
disposed
their
flowers
here
and
there
with
*NL*
the
light-heartedness
of
youth
,
and
at
intervals
as
unexpected
as
*NL*
certain
intervals
of
music
;
they
offered
me
an
indefinite
continuation
*NL*
of
the
same
charm
,
in
an
inexhaustible
profusion
,
but
without
letting
*NL*
me
delve
into
it
any
more
deeply
,
like
those
melodies
which
one
can
play
*NL*
over
a
hundred
times
in
succession
without
coming
any
nearer
to
their
*NL*
secret
.
I
turned
away
from
them
for
a
moment
so
as
to
be
able
to
return
*NL*
to
them
with
renewed
strength
.
My
eyes
followed
up
the
slope
which
,
*NL*
outside
the
hedge
,
rose
steeply
to
the
fields
,
a
poppy
that
had
strayed
*NL*
and
been
lost
by
its
fellows
,
or
a
few
cornflowers
that
had
fallen
*NL*
lazily
behind
,
and
decorated
the
ground
here
and
there
with
their
*NL*
flowers
like
the
border
of
a
tapestry
,
in
which
may
be
seen
at
intervals
*NL*
hints
of
the
rustic
theme
which
appears
triumphant
in
the
panel
itself
;
*NL*
infrequent
still
,
spaced
apart
as
the
scattered
houses
which
warn
us
*NL*
that
we
are
approaching
a
village
,
they
betokened
to
me
the
vast
expanse
*NL*
of
waving
corn
beneath
the
fleecy
clouds
,
and
the
sight
of
a
single
*NL*
poppy
hoisting
upon
its
slender
rigging
and
holding
against
the
breeze
*NL*
its
scarlet
ensign
,
over
the
buoy
of
rich
black
earth
from
which
it
*NL*
sprang
,
made
my
heart
beat
as
does
a
wayfarer
's
when
he
perceives
,
upon
*NL*
some
low-lying
ground
,
an
old
and
broken
boat
which
is
being
caulked
and
*NL*
made
seaworthy
,
and
cries
out
,
although
he
has
not
yet
caught
sight
of
*NL*
it
,
``
The
Sea
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
I
returned
to
my
hawthorns
,
and
stood
before
them
as
one
stands
*NL*
before
those
masterpieces
of
painting
which
,
one
imagines
,
one
will
*NL*
be
better
able
to
`
take
in
'
when
one
has
looked
away
,
for
a
moment
,
at
*NL*
something
else
;
but
in
vain
did
I
shape
my
fingers
into
a
frame
,
so
as
*NL*
to
have
nothing
but
the
hawthorns
before
my
eyes
;
the
sentiment
which
*NL*
they
aroused
in
me
remained
obscure
and
vague
,
struggling
and
failing
*NL*
to
free
itself
,
to
float
across
and
become
one
with
the
flowers
.
They
*NL*
themselves
offered
me
no
enlightenment
,
and
I
could
not
call
upon
any
*NL*
other
flowers
to
satisfy
this
mysterious
longing
.
And
then
,
inspiring
*NL*
me
with
that
rapture
which
we
feel
on
seeing
a
work
by
our
favourite
*NL*
painter
quite
different
from
any
of
those
that
we
already
know
,
or
,
*NL*
better
still
,
when
some
one
has
taken
us
and
set
us
down
in
front
of
a
*NL*
picture
of
which
we
have
hitherto
seen
no
more
than
a
pencilled
sketch
,
*NL*
or
when
a
piece
of
music
which
we
have
heard
played
over
on
the
piano
*NL*
bursts
out
again
in
our
ears
with
all
the
splendour
and
fullness
of
an
*NL*
orchestra
,
my
grandfather
called
me
to
him
,
and
,
pointing
to
the
hedge
*NL*
of
Tansonville
,
said
:
``
You
are
fond
of
hawthorns
;
just
look
at
this
pink
*NL*
one
;
is
n't
it
pretty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
indeed
a
hawthorn
,
but
one
whose
flowers
were
pink
,
and
*NL*
lovelier
even
than
the
white
.
It
,
too
,
was
in
holiday
attire
,
for
one
of
*NL*
those
days
which
are
the
only
true
holidays
,
the
holy
days
of
religion
,
*NL*
because
they
are
not
appointed
by
any
capricious
accident
,
as
secular
*NL*
holidays
are
appointed
,
upon
days
which
are
not
specially
ordained
for
*NL*
such
observances
,
which
have
nothing
about
them
that
is
essentially
*NL*
festal
--
but
it
was
attired
even
more
richly
than
the
rest
,
for
the
*NL*
flowers
which
clung
to
its
branches
,
one
above
another
,
so
thickly
as
to
*NL*
leave
no
part
of
the
tree
undecorated
,
like
the
tassels
wreathed
about
*NL*
the
crook
of
a
rococo
shepherdess
,
were
every
one
of
them
`
in
colour
,
'
*NL*
and
consequently
of
a
superior
quality
,
by
the
aesthetic
standards
of
*NL*
Combray
,
to
the
`
plain
,
'
if
one
was
to
judge
by
the
scale
of
prices
*NL*
at
the
`
stores
'
in
the
Square
,
or
at
Camus
's
,
where
the
most
expensive
*NL*
biscuits
were
those
whose
sugar
was
pink
.
And
for
my
own
part
I
set
a
*NL*
higher
value
on
cream
cheese
when
it
was
pink
,
when
I
had
been
allowed
*NL*
to
tinge
it
with
crushed
strawberries
.
And
these
flowers
had
chosen
*NL*
precisely
the
colour
of
some
edible
and
delicious
thing
,
or
of
some
*NL*
exquisite
addition
to
one
's
costume
for
a
great
festival
,
which
colours
,
*NL*
inasmuch
as
they
make
plain
the
reason
for
their
superiority
,
are
those
*NL*
whose
beauty
is
most
evident
to
the
eyes
of
children
,
and
for
that
*NL*
reason
must
always
seem
more
vivid
and
more
natural
than
any
other
*NL*
tints
,
even
after
the
child
's
mind
has
realised
that
they
offer
no
*NL*
gratification
to
the
appetite
,
and
have
not
been
selected
by
the
*NL*
dressmaker
.
And
,
indeed
,
I
had
felt
at
once
,
as
I
had
felt
before
*NL*
the
white
blossom
,
but
now
still
more
marvelling
,
that
it
was
in
no
*NL*
artificial
manner
,
by
no
device
of
human
construction
,
that
the
festal
*NL*
intention
of
these
flowers
was
revealed
,
but
that
it
was
Nature
herself
*NL*
who
had
spontaneously
expressed
it
-LRB-
with
the
simplicity
of
a
woman
from
*NL*
a
village
shop
,
labouring
at
the
decoration
of
a
street
altar
for
some
*NL*
procession
-RRB-
by
burying
the
bush
in
these
little
rosettes
,
almost
too
*NL*
ravishing
in
colour
,
this
rustic
`
pompadour
.
'
High
up
on
the
branches
,
*NL*
like
so
many
of
those
tiny
rose-trees
,
their
pots
concealed
in
jackets
*NL*
of
paper
lace
,
whose
slender
stems
rise
in
a
forest
from
the
altar
on
*NL*
the
greater
festivals
,
a
thousand
buds
were
swelling
and
opening
,
paler
*NL*
in
colour
,
but
each
disclosing
as
it
burst
,
as
at
the
bottom
of
a
cup
of
*NL*
pink
marble
,
its
blood-red
stain
,
and
suggesting
even
more
strongly
*NL*
than
the
full-blown
flowers
the
special
,
irresistible
quality
of
the
*NL*
hawthorn-tree
,
which
,
wherever
it
budded
,
wherever
it
was
about
to
*NL*
blossom
,
could
bud
and
blossom
in
pink
flowers
alone
.
Taking
its
place
*NL*
in
the
hedge
,
but
as
different
from
the
rest
as
a
young
girl
in
holiday
*NL*
attire
among
a
crowd
of
dowdy
women
in
everyday
clothes
,
who
are
staying
*NL*
at
home
,
equipped
and
ready
for
the
`
Month
of
Mary
,
'
of
which
it
seemed
*NL*
already
to
form
a
part
,
it
shone
and
smiled
in
its
cool
,
rosy
garments
,
*NL*
a
Catholic
bush
indeed
,
and
altogether
delightful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hedge
allowed
us
a
glimpse
,
inside
the
park
,
of
an
alley
bordered
*NL*
with
jasmine
,
pansies
,
and
verbenas
,
among
which
the
stocks
held
open
*NL*
their
fresh
plump
purses
,
of
a
pink
as
fragrant
and
as
faded
as
old
*NL*
Spanish
leather
,
while
on
the
gravel-path
a
long
watering-pipe
,
painted
*NL*
green
,
coiling
across
the
ground
,
poured
,
where
its
holes
were
,
over
the
*NL*
flowers
whose
perfume
those
holes
inhaled
,
a
vertical
and
prismatic
fan
*NL*
of
infinitesimal
,
rainbow-coloured
drops
.
Suddenly
I
stood
still
,
unable
*NL*
to
move
,
as
happens
when
something
appears
that
requires
not
only
our
*NL*
eyes
to
take
it
in
,
but
involves
a
deeper
kind
of
perception
and
takes
*NL*
possession
of
the
whole
of
our
being
.
A
little
girl
,
with
fair
,
reddish
*NL*
hair
,
who
appeared
to
be
returning
from
a
walk
,
and
held
a
trowel
in
her
*NL*
hand
,
was
looking
at
us
,
raising
towards
us
a
face
powdered
with
pinkish
*NL*
freckles
.
Her
black
eyes
gleamed
,
and
as
I
did
not
at
that
time
know
,
*NL*
and
indeed
have
never
since
learned
how
to
reduce
to
its
objective
*NL*
elements
any
strong
impression
,
since
I
had
not
,
as
they
say
,
enough
*NL*
`
power
of
observation
'
to
isolate
the
sense
of
their
colour
,
for
a
long
*NL*
time
afterwards
,
whenever
I
thought
of
her
,
the
memory
of
those
bright
*NL*
eyes
would
at
once
present
itself
to
me
as
a
vivid
azure
,
since
her
*NL*
complexion
was
fair
;
so
much
so
that
,
perhaps
,
if
her
eyes
had
not
been
*NL*
quite
so
black
--
which
was
what
struck
one
most
forcibly
on
first
meeting
*NL*
her
--
I
should
not
have
been
,
as
I
was
,
especially
enamoured
of
their
*NL*
imagined
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
gazed
at
her
,
at
first
with
that
gaze
which
is
not
merely
a
messenger
*NL*
from
the
eyes
,
but
in
whose
window
all
the
senses
assemble
and
lean
out
,
*NL*
petrified
and
anxious
,
that
gaze
which
would
fain
reach
,
touch
,
capture
,
*NL*
bear
off
in
triumph
the
body
at
which
it
is
aimed
,
and
the
soul
with
the
*NL*
body
;
then
-LRB-
so
frightened
was
I
lest
at
any
moment
my
grandfather
and
*NL*
father
,
catching
sight
of
the
girl
,
might
tear
me
away
from
her
,
by
*NL*
making
me
run
on
in
front
of
them
-RRB-
with
another
,
an
unconsciously
*NL*
appealing
look
,
whose
object
was
to
force
her
to
pay
attention
to
me
,
to
*NL*
see
,
to
know
me
.
She
cast
a
glance
forwards
and
sideways
,
so
as
to
take
*NL*
stock
of
my
grandfather
and
father
,
and
doubtless
the
impression
she
*NL*
formed
of
them
was
that
we
were
all
absurd
people
,
for
she
turned
away
*NL*
with
an
indifferent
and
contemptuous
air
,
withdrew
herself
so
as
to
*NL*
spare
her
face
the
indignity
of
remaining
within
their
field
of
*NL*
vision
;
and
while
they
,
continuing
to
walk
on
without
noticing
her
,
had
*NL*
overtaken
and
passed
me
,
she
allowed
her
eyes
to
wander
,
over
the
space
*NL*
that
lay
between
us
,
in
my
direction
,
without
any
particular
expression
,
*NL*
without
appearing
to
have
seen
me
,
but
with
an
intensity
,
a
half-hidden
*NL*
smile
which
I
was
unable
to
interpret
,
according
to
the
instruction
I
*NL*
had
received
in
the
ways
of
good
breeding
,
save
as
a
mark
of
infinite
*NL*
disgust
;
and
her
hand
,
at
the
same
time
,
sketched
in
the
air
an
*NL*
indelicate
gesture
,
for
which
,
when
it
was
addressed
in
public
to
a
*NL*
person
whom
one
did
not
know
,
the
little
dictionary
of
manners
which
*NL*
I
carried
in
my
mind
supplied
only
one
meaning
,
namely
,
a
deliberate
*NL*
insult
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gilberte
,
come
along
;
what
are
you
doing
?
''
called
out
in
a
piercing
*NL*
tone
of
authority
a
lady
in
white
,
whom
I
had
not
seen
until
that
*NL*
moment
,
while
,
a
little
way
beyond
her
,
a
gentleman
in
a
suit
of
linen
*NL*
`
ducks
,
'
whom
I
did
not
know
either
,
stared
at
me
with
eyes
which
seemed
*NL*
to
be
starting
from
his
head
;
the
little
girl
's
smile
abruptly
faded
,
*NL*
and
,
seizing
her
trowel
,
she
made
off
without
turning
to
look
again
in
*NL*
my
direction
,
with
an
air
of
obedience
,
inscrutable
and
sly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
was
wafted
to
my
ears
the
name
of
Gilberte
,
bestowed
on
me
like
a
*NL*
talisman
which
might
,
perhaps
,
enable
me
some
day
to
rediscover
her
whom
*NL*
its
syllables
had
just
endowed
with
a
definite
personality
,
whereas
,
a
*NL*
moment
earlier
,
she
had
been
only
something
vaguely
seen
.
So
it
came
*NL*
to
me
,
uttered
across
the
heads
of
the
stocks
and
jasmines
,
pungent
and
*NL*
cool
as
the
drops
which
fell
from
the
green
watering-pipe
;
impregnating
*NL*
and
irradiating
the
zone
of
pure
air
through
which
it
had
passed
,
which
*NL*
it
set
apart
and
isolated
from
all
other
air
,
with
the
mystery
of
the
*NL*
life
of
her
whom
its
syllables
designated
to
the
happy
creatures
that
*NL*
lived
and
walked
and
travelled
in
her
company
;
unfolding
through
the
*NL*
arch
of
the
pink
hawthorn
,
which
opened
at
the
height
of
my
shoulder
,
*NL*
the
quintessence
of
their
familiarity
--
so
exquisitely
painful
to
*NL*
myself
--
with
her
,
and
with
all
that
unknown
world
of
her
existence
,
into
*NL*
which
I
should
never
penetrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
-LRB-
while
we
moved
away
,
and
my
grandfather
murmured
:
``
Poor
*NL*
Swann
,
what
a
life
they
are
leading
him
;
fancy
sending
him
away
so
*NL*
that
she
can
be
left
alone
with
her
Charlus
--
for
that
was
Charlus
:
I
*NL*
recognised
him
at
once
!
And
the
child
,
too
;
at
her
age
,
to
be
mixed
up
*NL*
in
all
that
!
''
-RRB-
the
impression
left
on
me
by
the
despotic
tone
in
which
*NL*
Gilberte
's
mother
had
spoken
to
her
,
without
her
replying
,
by
exhibiting
*NL*
her
to
me
as
being
obliged
to
yield
obedience
to
some
one
else
,
as
not
*NL*
being
indeed
superior
to
the
whole
world
,
calmed
my
sufferings
somewhat
,
*NL*
revived
some
hope
in
me
,
and
cooled
the
ardour
of
my
love
.
But
very
soon
*NL*
that
love
surged
up
again
in
me
like
a
reaction
by
which
my
humiliated
*NL*
heart
was
endeavouring
to
rise
to
Gilberte
's
level
,
or
to
draw
her
down
*NL*
to
its
own
.
I
loved
her
;
I
was
sorry
not
to
have
had
the
time
and
the
*NL*
inspiration
to
insult
her
,
to
do
her
some
injury
,
to
force
her
to
keep
*NL*
some
memory
of
me
.
I
knew
her
to
be
so
beautiful
that
I
should
have
*NL*
liked
to
be
able
to
retrace
my
steps
so
as
to
shake
my
fist
at
her
and
*NL*
shout
,
``
I
think
you
are
hideous
,
grotesque
;
you
are
utterly
disgusting
!
''
*NL*
However
,
I
walked
away
,
carrying
with
me
,
then
and
for
ever
afterwards
,
*NL*
as
the
first
illustration
of
a
type
of
happiness
rendered
inaccessible
*NL*
to
a
little
boy
of
my
kind
by
certain
laws
of
nature
which
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
transgress
,
the
picture
of
a
little
girl
with
reddish
*NL*
hair
,
and
a
skin
freckled
with
tiny
pink
marks
,
who
held
a
trowel
in
*NL*
her
hand
,
and
smiled
as
she
directed
towards
me
a
long
and
subtle
and
*NL*
inexpressive
stare
.
And
already
the
charm
with
which
her
name
,
like
a
*NL*
cloud
of
incense
,
had
filled
that
archway
in
the
pink
hawthorn
through
*NL*
which
she
and
I
had
,
together
,
heard
its
sound
,
was
beginning
to
*NL*
conquer
,
to
cover
,
to
embalm
,
to
beautify
everything
with
which
it
had
*NL*
any
association
:
her
grandparents
,
whom
my
own
had
been
so
unspeakably
*NL*
fortunate
as
to
know
,
the
glorious
profession
of
a
stockholder
,
even
*NL*
the
melancholy
neighbourhood
of
the
Champs-Elysées
,
where
she
lived
in
*NL*
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Léonie
,
''
said
my
grandfather
on
our
return
,
``
I
wish
we
had
had
you
with
*NL*
us
this
afternoon
.
You
would
never
have
known
Tansonville
.
If
I
had
had
*NL*
the
courage
I
would
have
cut
you
a
branch
of
that
pink
hawthorn
you
used
*NL*
to
like
so
much
.
''
And
so
my
grandfather
told
her
the
story
of
our
walk
,
*NL*
either
just
to
amuse
her
,
or
perhaps
because
there
was
still
some
hope
*NL*
that
she
might
be
stimulated
to
rise
from
her
bed
and
to
go
out
of
*NL*
doors
.
For
in
earlier
days
she
had
been
very
fond
of
Tansonville
,
and
,
*NL*
moreover
,
Swann
's
visits
had
been
the
last
that
she
had
continued
to
*NL*
receive
,
at
a
time
when
she
had
already
closed
her
doors
to
all
the
*NL*
world
.
And
just
as
,
when
he
called
,
in
these
later
days
,
to
inquire
for
*NL*
her
-LRB-
and
she
was
still
the
only
person
in
our
household
whom
he
would
*NL*
ask
to
see
-RRB-
,
she
would
send
down
to
say
that
she
was
tired
at
the
moment
*NL*
and
resting
,
but
that
she
would
be
happy
to
see
him
another
time
,
*NL*
so
,
this
evening
,
she
said
to
my
grandfather
,
``
Yes
,
some
day
when
the
*NL*
weather
is
fine
I
shall
go
for
a
drive
as
far
as
the
gate
of
the
park
.
''
*NL*
And
in
saying
this
she
was
quite
sincere
.
She
would
have
liked
to
see
*NL*
Swann
and
Tansonville
again
;
but
the
mere
wish
to
do
so
sufficed
for
all
*NL*
that
remained
of
her
strength
,
which
its
fulfilment
would
have
more
*NL*
than
exhausted
.
Sometimes
a
spell
of
fine
weather
made
her
a
little
more
*NL*
energetic
,
she
would
rise
and
put
on
her
clothes
;
but
before
she
had
*NL*
reached
the
outer
room
she
would
be
`
tired
'
again
,
and
would
insist
on
*NL*
returning
to
her
bed
.
The
process
which
had
begun
in
her
--
and
in
her
a
*NL*
little
earlier
only
than
it
must
come
to
all
of
us
--
was
the
great
and
*NL*
general
renunciation
which
old
age
makes
in
preparation
for
death
,
the
*NL*
chrysalis
stage
of
life
,
which
may
be
observed
wherever
life
has
been
*NL*
unduly
prolonged
;
even
in
old
lovers
who
have
lived
for
one
another
with
*NL*
the
utmost
intensity
of
passion
,
and
in
old
friends
bound
by
the
closest
*NL*
ties
of
mental
sympathy
,
who
,
after
a
certain
year
,
cease
to
make
,
the
*NL*
necessary
journey
,
or
even
to
cross
the
street
to
see
one
another
,
cease
*NL*
to
correspond
,
and
know
well
that
they
will
communicate
no
more
in
this
*NL*
world
.
My
aunt
must
have
been
perfectly
well
aware
that
she
would
not
*NL*
see
Swann
again
,
that
she
would
never
leave
her
own
house
any
more
,
but
*NL*
this
ultimate
seclusion
seemed
to
be
accepted
by
her
with
all
the
more
*NL*
readiness
for
the
very
reason
which
,
to
our
minds
,
ought
to
have
made
*NL*
it
more
unbearable
;
namely
,
that
such
a
seclusion
was
forced
upon
her
by
*NL*
the
gradual
and
steady
diminution
in
her
strength
which
she
was
able
to
*NL*
measure
daily
,
which
,
by
making
every
action
,
every
movement
`
tiring
'
to
*NL*
her
if
not
actually
painful
,
gave
to
inaction
,
isolation
and
silence
the
*NL*
blessed
,
strengthening
and
refreshing
charm
of
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
aunt
did
not
go
to
see
the
pink
hawthorn
in
the
hedge
,
but
at
all
*NL*
hours
of
the
day
I
would
ask
the
rest
of
my
family
whether
she
was
*NL*
not
going
to
go
,
whether
she
used
not
,
at
one
time
,
to
go
often
to
*NL*
Tansonville
,
trying
to
make
them
speak
of
Mlle.
Swann
's
parents
and
*NL*
grandparents
,
who
appeared
to
me
to
be
as
great
and
glorious
as
gods
.
*NL*
The
name
,
which
had
for
me
become
almost
mythological
,
of
Swann
--
when
I
*NL*
talked
with
my
family
I
would
grow
sick
with
longing
to
hear
them
*NL*
utter
it
;
I
dared
not
pronounce
it
myself
,
but
I
would
draw
them
into
a
*NL*
discussion
of
matters
which
led
naturally
to
Gilberte
and
her
family
,
in
*NL*
which
she
was
involved
,
in
speaking
of
which
I
would
feel
myself
not
too
*NL*
remotely
banished
from
her
company
;
and
I
would
suddenly
force
my
father
*NL*
-LRB-
by
pretending
,
for
instance
,
to
believe
that
my
grandfather
's
business
*NL*
had
been
in
our
family
before
his
day
,
or
that
the
hedge
with
the
pink
*NL*
hawthorn
which
my
aunt
Léonie
wished
to
visit
was
on
common
ground
-RRB-
to
*NL*
correct
my
statements
,
to
say
,
as
though
in
opposition
to
me
and
of
his
*NL*
own
accord
:
``
No
,
no
,
the
business
belonged
to
_
Swann
's
_
father
,
that
*NL*
hedge
is
part
of
_
Swann
's
_
park
.
''
And
then
I
would
be
obliged
to
pause
*NL*
for
breath
;
so
stifling
was
the
pressure
,
upon
that
part
of
me
where
it
*NL*
was
for
ever
inscribed
,
of
that
name
which
,
at
the
moment
when
I
heard
*NL*
it
,
seemed
to
me
fuller
,
more
portentous
than
any
other
name
,
because
*NL*
it
was
burdened
with
the
weight
of
all
the
occasions
on
which
I
had
*NL*
secretly
uttered
it
in
my
mind
.
It
caused
me
a
pleasure
which
I
was
*NL*
ashamed
to
have
dared
to
demand
from
my
parents
,
for
so
great
was
it
*NL*
that
to
have
procured
it
for
me
must
have
involved
them
in
an
immensity
*NL*
of
effort
,
and
with
no
recompense
,
since
for
them
there
was
no
pleasure
*NL*
in
the
sound
.
And
so
I
would
prudently
turn
the
conversation
.
And
by
*NL*
a
scruple
of
conscience
,
also
.
All
the
singular
seductions
which
I
had
*NL*
stored
up
in
the
sound
of
that
word
Swann
,
I
found
again
as
soon
as
it
*NL*
was
uttered
.
And
then
it
occurred
to
me
suddenly
that
my
parents
could
*NL*
not
fail
to
experience
the
same
emotions
,
that
they
must
find
themselves
*NL*
sharing
my
point
of
view
,
that
they
perceived
in
their
turn
,
that
they
*NL*
condoned
,
that
they
even
embraced
my
visionary
longings
,
and
I
was
as
*NL*
wretched
as
though
I
had
ravished
and
corrupted
the
innocence
of
their
*NL*
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
year
my
family
fixed
the
day
of
their
return
to
Paris
rather
*NL*
earlier
than
usual
.
On
the
morning
of
our
departure
I
had
had
my
*NL*
hair
curled
,
to
be
ready
to
face
the
photographer
,
had
had
a
new
hat
*NL*
carefully
set
upon
my
head
,
and
had
been
buttoned
into
a
velvet
jacket
;
*NL*
a
little
later
my
mother
,
after
searching
everywhere
for
me
,
found
me
*NL*
standing
in
tears
on
that
steep
little
hillside
close
to
Tansonville
,
*NL*
bidding
a
long
farewell
to
my
hawthorns
,
clasping
their
sharp
branches
*NL*
to
my
bosom
,
and
-LRB-
like
a
princess
in
a
tragedy
,
oppressed
by
the
weight
*NL*
of
all
her
senseless
jewellery
-RRB-
with
no
gratitude
towards
the
officious
*NL*
hand
which
had
,
in
curling
those
ringlets
,
been
at
pains
to
collect
all
*NL*
my
hair
upon
my
forehead
;
trampling
underfoot
the
curl-papers
which
I
*NL*
had
torn
from
my
head
,
and
my
new
hat
with
them
.
My
mother
was
not
at
*NL*
all
moved
by
my
tears
,
but
she
could
not
suppress
a
cry
at
the
sight
of
*NL*
my
battered
headgear
and
my
ruined
jacket
.
I
did
not
,
however
,
hear
her
.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
poor
little
hawthorns
,
''
I
was
assuring
them
through
my
sobs
,
``
it
*NL*
is
not
you
that
want
to
make
me
unhappy
,
to
force
me
to
leave
you
.
*NL*
You
,
you
have
never
done
me
any
harm
.
So
I
shall
always
love
you
.
''
And
,
*NL*
drying
my
eyes
,
I
promised
them
that
,
when
I
grew
up
,
I
would
never
copy
*NL*
the
foolish
example
of
other
men
,
but
that
even
in
Paris
,
on
fine
spring
*NL*
days
,
instead
of
paying
calls
and
listening
to
silly
talk
,
I
would
make
*NL*
excursions
into
the
country
to
see
the
first
hawthorn-trees
in
bloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
in
the
fields
we
never
left
them
again
during
the
rest
of
our
*NL*
Méséglise
walk
.
They
were
perpetually
crossed
,
as
though
by
invisible
*NL*
streams
of
traffic
,
by
the
wind
,
which
was
to
me
the
tutelary
genius
of
*NL*
Combray
.
Every
year
,
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
,
in
order
to
feel
that
I
*NL*
really
was
at
Combray
,
I
would
climb
the
hill
to
find
it
running
again
*NL*
through
my
clothing
,
and
setting
me
running
in
its
wake
.
One
always
*NL*
had
the
wind
for
companion
when
one
went
the
'M
éséglise
way
,
'
on
*NL*
that
swelling
plain
which
stretched
,
mile
beyond
mile
,
without
any
*NL*
disturbance
of
its
gentle
contour
.
I
knew
that
Mlle.
Swann
used
often
*NL*
to
go
and
spend
a
few
days
at
Laon
,
and
,
for
all
that
it
was
many
*NL*
miles
away
,
the
distance
was
obviated
by
the
absence
of
any
intervening
*NL*
obstacle
;
when
,
on
hot
afternoons
,
I
would
see
a
breath
of
wind
emerge
*NL*
from
the
farthest
horizon
,
bowing
the
heads
of
the
corn
in
distant
*NL*
fields
,
pouring
like
a
flood
over
all
that
vast
expanse
,
and
finally
*NL*
settling
down
,
warm
and
rustling
,
among
the
clover
and
sainfoin
at
my
*NL*
feet
,
that
plain
which
was
common
to
us
both
seemed
then
to
draw
us
*NL*
together
,
to
unite
us
;
I
would
imagine
that
the
same
breath
had
passed
*NL*
by
her
also
,
that
there
was
some
message
from
her
in
what
it
was
*NL*
whispering
to
me
,
without
my
being
able
to
understand
it
,
and
I
would
*NL*
catch
and
kiss
it
as
it
passed
.
On
my
left
was
a
village
called
Champieu
*NL*
-LRB-
_
Campus
Pagani
_
,
according
to
the
Curé
-RRB-
.
On
my
right
I
could
see
*NL*
across
the
cornfields
the
two
crocketed
,
rustic
spires
of
*NL*
Saint-André-des-Champs
,
themselves
as
tapering
,
scaly
,
plated
,
*NL*
honeycombed
,
yellowed
,
and
roughened
as
two
ears
of
wheat
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
regular
intervals
,
among
the
inimitable
ornamentation
of
their
*NL*
leaves
,
which
can
be
mistaken
for
those
of
no
other
fruit-tree
,
the
*NL*
apple-trees
were
exposing
their
broad
petals
of
white
satin
,
or
hanging
*NL*
in
shy
bunches
their
unopened
,
blushing
buds
.
It
was
while
going
*NL*
the
'M
éséglise
way
'
that
I
first
noticed
the
circular
shadow
which
*NL*
apple-trees
cast
upon
the
sunlit
ground
,
and
also
those
impalpable
*NL*
threads
of
golden
silk
which
the
setting
sun
weaves
slantingly
downwards
*NL*
from
beneath
their
leaves
,
and
which
I
would
see
my
father
slash
through
*NL*
with
his
stick
without
ever
making
them
swerve
from
their
straight
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
in
the
afternoon
sky
a
white
moon
would
creep
up
like
a
little
*NL*
cloud
,
furtive
,
without
display
,
suggesting
an
actress
who
does
not
have
*NL*
to
`
come
on
'
for
a
while
,
and
so
goes
`
in
front
'
in
her
ordinary
*NL*
clothes
to
watch
the
rest
of
the
company
for
a
moment
,
but
keeps
in
the
*NL*
background
,
not
wishing
to
attract
attention
to
herself
.
I
was
glad
to
*NL*
find
her
image
reproduced
in
books
and
paintings
,
though
these
works
of
*NL*
art
were
very
different
--
at
least
in
my
earlier
years
,
before
Bloch
had
*NL*
attuned
my
eyes
and
mind
to
more
subtle
harmonies
--
from
those
in
*NL*
which
the
moon
seems
fair
to
me
to-day
,
but
in
which
I
should
not
have
*NL*
recognised
her
then
.
It
might
be
,
for
instance
,
some
novel
by
Saintine
,
*NL*
some
landscape
by
Gleyre
,
in
which
she
is
cut
out
sharply
against
the
*NL*
sky
,
in
the
form
of
a
silver
sickle
,
some
work
as
unsophisticated
and
*NL*
as
incomplete
as
were
,
at
that
date
,
my
own
impressions
,
and
which
it
*NL*
enraged
my
grandmother
's
sisters
to
see
me
admire
.
They
held
that
one
*NL*
ought
to
set
before
children
,
and
that
children
shewed
their
own
innate
*NL*
good
taste
in
admiring
,
only
such
books
and
pictures
as
they
would
*NL*
continue
to
admire
when
their
minds
were
developed
and
mature
.
No
doubt
*NL*
they
regarded
aesthetic
values
as
material
objects
which
an
unclouded
*NL*
vision
could
not
fail
to
discern
,
without
needing
to
have
their
*NL*
equivalent
in
experience
of
life
stored
up
and
slowly
ripening
in
one
's
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
along
the
'M
éséglise
way
,
'
at
Montjouvain
,
a
house
built
on
the
*NL*
edge
of
a
large
pond
,
and
overlooked
by
a
steep
,
shrub-grown
hill
,
that
*NL*
M.
Vinteuil
lived
.
And
so
we
used
often
to
meet
his
daughter
driving
her
*NL*
dogcart
at
full
speed
along
the
road
.
After
a
certain
year
we
never
*NL*
saw
her
alone
,
but
always
accompanied
by
a
friend
,
a
girl
older
than
*NL*
herself
,
with
an
evil
reputation
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
in
the
end
*NL*
installed
herself
permanently
,
one
day
,
at
Montjouvain
.
People
said
:
*NL*
``
That
poor
M.
Vinteuil
must
be
blinded
by
love
not
to
see
what
everyone
*NL*
is
talking
about
,
and
to
let
his
daughter
--
a
man
who
is
horrified
if
you
*NL*
use
a
word
in
the
wrong
sense
--
bring
a
woman
like
that
to
live
under
his
*NL*
roof
.
He
says
that
she
is
a
most
superior
woman
,
with
a
heart
of
gold
,
*NL*
and
that
she
would
have
shewn
extraordinary
musical
talent
if
she
had
*NL*
only
been
trained
.
He
may
be
sure
it
is
not
music
that
she
is
teaching
*NL*
his
daughter
.
''
But
M.
Vinteuil
assured
them
that
it
was
,
and
indeed
*NL*
it
is
remarkable
that
people
never
fail
to
arouse
admiration
of
their
*NL*
normal
qualities
in
the
relatives
of
anyone
with
whom
they
are
in
*NL*
physical
intercourse
.
Bodily
passion
,
which
has
been
so
unjustly
*NL*
decried
,
compels
its
victims
to
display
every
vestige
that
is
in
them
*NL*
of
unselfishness
and
generosity
,
and
so
effectively
that
they
shine
*NL*
resplendent
in
the
eyes
of
all
beholders
.
Dr.
Percepied
,
whose
loud
*NL*
voice
and
bushy
eyebrows
enabled
him
to
play
to
his
heart
's
content
the
*NL*
part
of
`
double-dealer
,
'
a
part
to
which
he
was
not
,
otherwise
,
adapted
,
*NL*
without
in
the
least
degree
compromising
his
unassailable
and
quite
*NL*
unmerited
reputation
of
being
a
kind-hearted
old
curmudgeon
,
could
make
*NL*
the
Curé
and
everyone
else
laugh
until
they
cried
by
saying
in
a
harsh
*NL*
voice
:
``
What
d'ye
say
to
this
,
now
?
It
seems
that
she
plays
music
with
*NL*
her
friend
,
Mlle.
Vinteuil
.
That
surprises
you
,
does
it
?
Oh
,
I
know
*NL*
nothing
,
nothing
at
all
.
It
was
Papa
Vinteuil
who
told
me
all
about
*NL*
it
yesterday
.
After
all
,
she
has
every
right
to
be
fond
of
music
,
that
*NL*
girl
.
I
should
never
dream
of
thwarting
the
artistic
vocation
of
a
*NL*
child
;
nor
Vinteuil
either
,
it
seems
.
And
then
he
plays
music
too
,
*NL*
with
his
daughter
's
friend
.
Why
,
gracious
heavens
,
it
must
be
a
regular
*NL*
musical
box
,
that
house
out
there
!
What
are
you
laughing
at
?
I
say
*NL*
they
've
been
playing
too
much
music
,
those
people
.
I
met
Papa
Vinteuil
*NL*
the
other
day
,
by
the
cemetery
.
It
was
all
he
could
do
to
keep
on
his
*NL*
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Anyone
who
,
like
ourselves
,
had
seen
M.
Vinteuil
,
about
this
time
,
*NL*
avoiding
people
whom
he
knew
,
and
turning
away
as
soon
as
he
caught
*NL*
sight
of
them
,
changed
in
a
few
months
into
an
old
man
,
engulfed
in
a
*NL*
sea
of
sorrows
,
incapable
of
any
effort
not
directly
aimed
at
promoting
*NL*
his
daughter
's
happiness
,
spending
whole
days
beside
his
wife
's
grave
,
*NL*
could
hardly
have
failed
to
realise
that
he
was
gradually
dying
of
a
*NL*
broken
heart
,
could
hardly
have
supposed
that
he
paid
no
attention
to
*NL*
the
rumours
which
were
going
about
.
He
knew
,
perhaps
he
even
believed
,
*NL*
what
his
neighbours
were
saying
.
There
is
probably
no
one
,
however
rigid
*NL*
his
virtue
,
who
is
not
liable
to
find
himself
,
by
the
complexity
of
*NL*
circumstances
,
living
at
close
quarters
with
the
very
vice
which
*NL*
he
himself
has
been
most
outspoken
in
condemning
,
without
at
first
*NL*
recognising
it
beneath
the
disguise
which
it
assumes
on
entering
his
*NL*
presence
,
so
as
to
wound
him
and
to
make
him
suffer
;
the
odd
words
,
the
*NL*
unaccountable
attitude
,
one
evening
,
of
a
person
whom
he
has
a
thousand
*NL*
reasons
for
loving
.
But
for
a
man
of
M.
Vinteuil
's
sensibility
it
must
*NL*
have
been
far
more
painful
than
for
a
hardened
man
of
the
world
to
have
*NL*
to
resign
himself
to
one
of
those
situations
which
are
wrongly
supposed
*NL*
to
occur
in
Bohemian
circles
only
;
for
they
are
produced
whenever
there
*NL*
needs
to
establish
itself
in
the
security
necessary
to
its
development
a
*NL*
vice
which
Nature
herself
has
planted
in
the
soul
of
a
child
,
perhaps
by
*NL*
no
more
than
blending
the
virtues
of
its
father
and
mother
,
as
she
might
*NL*
blend
the
colours
of
their
eyes
.
And
yet
however
much
M.
Vinteuil
*NL*
may
have
known
of
his
daughter
's
conduct
it
did
not
follow
that
his
*NL*
adoration
of
her
grew
any
less
.
The
facts
of
life
do
not
penetrate
to
*NL*
the
sphere
in
which
our
beliefs
are
cherished
;
as
it
was
not
they
that
*NL*
engendered
those
beliefs
,
so
they
are
powerless
to
destroy
them
;
they
*NL*
can
aim
at
them
continual
blows
of
contradiction
and
disproof
without
*NL*
weakening
them
;
and
an
avalanche
of
miseries
and
maladies
coming
,
one
*NL*
after
another
,
without
interruption
into
the
bosom
of
a
family
,
will
not
*NL*
make
it
lose
faith
in
either
the
clemency
of
its
God
or
the
capacity
of
*NL*
its
physician
.
But
when
M.
Vinteuil
regarded
his
daughter
and
himself
*NL*
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
world
,
and
of
their
reputation
,
when
he
*NL*
attempted
to
place
himself
by
her
side
in
the
rank
which
they
occupied
*NL*
in
the
general
estimation
of
their
neighbours
,
then
he
was
bound
to
give
*NL*
judgment
,
to
utter
his
own
and
her
social
condemnation
in
precisely
*NL*
the
terms
which
the
inhabitant
of
Combray
most
hostile
to
him
and
his
*NL*
daughter
would
have
employed
;
he
saw
himself
and
her
in
`
low
,
'
in
the
*NL*
very
`
lowest
water
,
'
inextricably
stranded
;
and
his
manners
had
of
late
*NL*
been
tinged
with
that
humility
,
that
respect
for
persons
who
ranked
*NL*
above
him
and
to
whom
he
must
now
look
up
-LRB-
however
far
beneath
him
they
*NL*
might
hitherto
have
been
-RRB-
,
that
tendency
to
search
for
some
means
of
*NL*
rising
again
to
their
level
,
which
is
an
almost
mechanical
result
of
any
*NL*
human
misfortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
we
were
walking
with
Swann
in
one
of
the
streets
of
*NL*
Combray
,
M.
Vinteuil
,
turning
out
of
another
street
,
found
himself
so
*NL*
suddenly
face
to
face
with
us
all
that
he
had
not
time
to
escape
;
and
*NL*
Swann
,
with
that
almost
arrogant
charity
of
a
man
of
the
world
who
,
*NL*
amid
the
dissolution
of
all
his
own
moral
prejudices
,
finds
in
another
's
*NL*
shame
merely
a
reason
for
treating
him
with
a
friendly
benevolence
,
the
*NL*
outward
signs
of
which
serve
to
enhance
and
gratify
the
self-esteem
of
*NL*
the
bestower
because
he
feels
that
they
are
all
the
more
precious
to
him
*NL*
upon
whom
they
are
bestowed
,
conversed
at
great
length
with
M.
Vinteuil
,
*NL*
with
whom
for
a
long
time
he
had
been
barely
on
speaking
terms
,
and
*NL*
invited
him
,
before
leaving
us
,
to
send
his
daughter
over
,
one
day
,
*NL*
to
play
at
Tansonville
.
It
was
an
invitation
which
,
two
years
earlier
,
*NL*
would
have
enraged
M.
Vinteuil
,
but
which
now
filled
him
with
so
much
*NL*
gratitude
that
he
felt
himself
obliged
to
refrain
from
the
indiscretion
*NL*
of
accepting
.
Swann
's
friendly
regard
for
his
daughter
seemed
to
him
to
*NL*
be
in
itself
so
honourable
,
so
precious
a
support
for
his
cause
that
he
*NL*
felt
it
would
perhaps
be
better
to
make
no
use
of
it
,
so
as
to
have
the
*NL*
wholly
Platonic
satisfaction
of
keeping
it
in
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
charming
man
!
''
he
said
to
us
,
after
Swann
had
gone
,
with
the
*NL*
same
enthusiasm
and
veneration
which
make
clever
and
pretty
women
of
the
*NL*
middle
classes
fall
victims
to
the
physical
and
intellectual
charms
of
a
*NL*
duchess
,
even
though
she
be
ugly
and
a
fool
.
``
What
a
charming
man
!
What
*NL*
a
pity
that
he
should
have
made
such
a
deplorable
marriage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
so
strong
an
element
of
hypocrisy
is
there
in
even
the
most
*NL*
sincere
of
men
,
who
cast
off
,
while
they
are
talking
to
anyone
,
the
*NL*
opinion
they
actually
hold
of
him
and
will
express
when
he
is
no
longer
*NL*
there
,
my
family
joined
with
M.
Vinteuil
in
deploring
Swann
's
marriage
,
*NL*
invoking
principles
and
conventions
which
-LRB-
all
the
more
because
they
*NL*
invoked
them
in
common
with
him
,
as
though
we
were
all
thorough
good
*NL*
fellows
of
the
same
sort
-RRB-
they
appeared
to
suggest
were
in
no
way
*NL*
infringed
at
Montjouvain
.
M.
Vinteuil
did
not
send
his
daughter
to
visit
*NL*
Swann
,
an
omission
which
Swann
was
the
first
to
regret
.
For
constantly
,
*NL*
after
meeting
M.
Vinteuil
,
he
would
remember
that
he
had
been
meaning
*NL*
for
a
long
time
to
ask
him
about
some
one
of
the
same
name
as
himself
,
*NL*
one
of
his
relatives
,
Swann
supposed
.
And
on
this
occasion
he
determined
*NL*
that
he
would
not
forget
what
he
had
to
say
to
him
when
M.
Vinteuil
*NL*
should
appear
with
his
daughter
at
Tansonville
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
'M
éséglise
way
'
was
the
shorter
of
the
two
that
we
used
to
*NL*
take
for
our
walks
round
Combray
,
and
for
that
reason
was
reserved
for
*NL*
days
of
uncertain
weather
,
it
followed
that
the
climate
of
Méséglise
*NL*
shewed
an
unduly
high
rainfall
,
and
we
would
never
lose
sight
of
the
*NL*
fringe
of
Roussainville
wood
,
so
that
we
could
,
at
any
moment
,
run
for
*NL*
shelter
beneath
its
dense
thatch
of
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
the
sun
would
disappear
behind
a
cloud
,
which
impinged
on
its
*NL*
roundness
,
but
whose
edge
the
sun
gilded
in
return
.
The
brightness
,
*NL*
though
not
the
light
of
day
,
would
then
be
shut
off
from
a
landscape
*NL*
in
which
all
life
appeared
to
be
suspended
,
while
the
little
village
*NL*
of
Roussainville
carved
in
relief
upon
the
sky
the
white
mass
of
its
*NL*
gables
,
with
a
startling
precision
of
detail
.
A
gust
of
wind
blew
from
*NL*
its
perch
a
rook
,
which
floated
away
and
settled
in
the
distance
,
while
*NL*
beneath
a
paling
sky
the
woods
on
the
horizon
assumed
a
deeper
tone
of
*NL*
blue
,
as
though
they
were
painted
in
one
of
those
cameos
which
you
still
*NL*
find
decorating
the
walls
of
old
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
other
days
would
begin
to
fall
the
rain
,
of
which
we
had
had
due
*NL*
warning
from
the
little
barometer-figure
which
the
spectacle-maker
hung
*NL*
out
in
his
doorway
.
Its
drops
,
like
migrating
birds
which
fly
off
in
a
*NL*
body
at
a
given
moment
,
would
come
down
out
of
the
sky
in
close
marching
*NL*
order
.
They
would
never
drift
apart
,
would
make
no
movement
at
random
in
*NL*
their
rapid
course
,
but
each
one
,
keeping
in
its
place
,
would
draw
*NL*
after
it
the
drop
which
was
following
,
and
the
sky
would
be
as
greatly
*NL*
darkened
as
by
the
swallows
flying
south
.
We
would
take
refuge
among
the
*NL*
trees
.
And
when
it
seemed
that
their
flight
was
accomplished
,
a
few
last
*NL*
drops
,
feebler
and
slower
than
the
rest
,
would
still
come
down
.
But
we
*NL*
would
emerge
from
our
shelter
,
for
the
rain
was
playing
a
game
,
now
,
*NL*
among
the
branches
,
and
,
even
when
it
was
almost
dry
again
underfoot
,
a
*NL*
stray
drop
or
two
,
lingering
in
the
hollow
of
a
leaf
,
would
run
down
and
*NL*
hang
glistening
from
the
point
of
it
until
suddenly
it
splashed
plump
*NL*
upon
our
upturned
faces
from
the
whole
height
of
the
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
too
,
we
would
hurry
for
shelter
,
tumbling
in
among
all
its
stony
*NL*
saints
and
patriarchs
,
into
the
porch
of
Saint-André-des-Champs
,
How
*NL*
typically
French
that
church
was
!
Over
its
door
the
saints
,
the
kings
*NL*
of
chivalry
with
lilies
in
their
hands
,
the
wedding
scenes
and
funerals
*NL*
were
carved
as
they
might
have
been
in
the
mind
of
Françoise
.
The
*NL*
sculptor
had
also
recorded
certain
anecdotes
of
Aristotle
and
Virgil
,
*NL*
precisely
as
Françoise
in
her
kitchen
would
break
into
speech
about
*NL*
Saint
Louis
as
though
she
herself
had
known
him
,
generally
in
order
to
*NL*
depreciate
,
by
contrast
with
him
,
my
grandparents
,
whom
she
considered
*NL*
less
`
righteous
.
'
One
could
see
that
the
ideas
which
the
mediaeval
*NL*
artist
and
the
mediaeval
peasant
-LRB-
who
had
survived
to
cook
for
us
in
*NL*
the
nineteenth
century
-RRB-
had
of
classical
and
of
early
Christian
history
,
*NL*
ideas
whose
inaccuracy
was
atoned
for
by
their
honest
simplicity
,
were
*NL*
derived
not
from
books
,
but
from
a
tradition
at
once
ancient
and
direct
,
*NL*
unbroken
,
oral
,
degraded
,
unrecognisable
,
and
alive
.
Another
Combray
*NL*
person
whom
I
could
discern
also
,
potential
and
typified
,
in
the
gothic
*NL*
sculptures
of
Saint-André-des-Champs
was
young
Théodore
,
the
assistant
*NL*
in
Camus
's
shop
.
And
,
indeed
,
Françoise
herself
was
well
aware
that
she
*NL*
had
in
him
a
countryman
and
contemporary
,
for
when
my
aunt
was
too
ill
*NL*
for
Françoise
to
be
able
,
unaided
,
to
lift
her
in
her
bed
or
to
carry
*NL*
her
to
her
chair
,
rather
than
let
the
kitchen-maid
come
upstairs
*NL*
and
,
perhaps
,
`
make
an
impression
'
on
my
aunt
,
she
would
send
out
for
*NL*
Théodore
.
And
this
lad
,
who
was
regarded
,
and
quite
rightly
,
in
the
town
*NL*
as
a
`
bad
character
,
'
was
so
abounding
in
that
spirit
which
had
served
*NL*
to
decorate
the
porch
of
Saint-André-des-Champs
,
and
particularly
in
the
*NL*
feelings
of
respect
due
,
in
Françoise
eyes
,
to
all
`
poor
invalids
,
'
and
,
*NL*
above
all
,
to
her
own
`
poor
mistress
,
'
that
he
had
,
when
he
bent
down
*NL*
to
raise
my
aunt
's
head
from
her
pillow
,
the
same
air
of
préraphaélite
*NL*
simplicity
and
zeal
which
the
little
angels
in
the
bas-reliefs
wear
,
who
*NL*
throng
,
with
tapers
in
their
hands
,
about
the
deathbed
of
Our
Lady
,
as
*NL*
though
those
carved
faces
of
stone
,
naked
and
grey
like
trees
in
winter
,
*NL*
were
,
like
them
,
asleep
only
,
storing
up
life
and
waiting
to
flower
*NL*
again
in
countless
plebeian
faces
,
reverend
and
cunning
as
the
face
of
*NL*
Théodore
,
and
glowing
with
the
ruddy
brilliance
of
ripe
apples
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
too
,
not
fastened
to
the
wall
like
the
little
angels
,
but
*NL*
detached
from
the
porch
,
of
more
than
human
stature
,
erect
upon
her
*NL*
pedestal
as
upon
a
footstool
,
which
had
been
placed
there
to
save
her
*NL*
feet
from
contact
with
the
wet
ground
,
stood
a
saint
with
the
full
*NL*
cheeks
,
the
firm
breasts
which
swelled
out
inside
her
draperies
like
*NL*
a
cluster
of
ripe
grapes
inside
a
bag
,
the
narrow
forehead
,
short
and
*NL*
stubborn
nose
,
deep-set
eyes
,
and
strong
,
thick-skinned
,
courageous
*NL*
expression
of
the
country-women
of
those
parts
.
This
similarity
,
which
*NL*
imparted
to
the
statue
itself
a
kindliness
that
I
had
not
looked
to
*NL*
find
in
it
,
was
corroborated
often
by
the
arrival
of
some
girl
from
*NL*
the
fields
,
come
,
like
ourselves
,
for
shelter
beneath
the
porch
,
whose
*NL*
presence
there
--
as
when
the
leaves
of
a
climbing
plant
have
grown
up
*NL*
beside
leaves
carved
in
stone
--
seemed
intended
by
fate
to
allow
us
,
by
*NL*
confronting
it
with
its
type
in
nature
,
to
form
a
critical
estimate
*NL*
of
the
truth
of
the
work
of
art
.
Before
our
eyes
,
in
the
distance
,
a
*NL*
promised
or
an
accursed
land
,
Roussainville
,
within
whose
walls
I
had
*NL*
never
penetrated
,
Roussainville
was
now
,
when
the
rain
had
ceased
for
*NL*
us
,
still
being
chastised
,
like
a
village
in
the
Old
Testament
,
by
*NL*
all
the
innumerable
spears
and
arrows
of
the
storm
,
which
beat
down
*NL*
obliquely
upon
the
dwellings
of
its
inhabitants
,
or
else
had
already
*NL*
received
the
forgiveness
of
the
Almighty
,
Who
had
restored
to
it
the
*NL*
light
of
His
sun
,
which
fell
upon
it
in
rays
of
uneven
length
,
like
the
*NL*
rays
of
a
monstrance
upon
an
altar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
when
the
weather
had
completely
broken
,
we
were
obliged
to
go
*NL*
home
and
to
remain
shut
up
indoors
.
Here
and
there
,
in
the
distance
,
in
*NL*
a
landscape
which
,
what
with
the
failing
light
and
saturated
atmosphere
,
*NL*
resembled
a
seascape
rather
,
a
few
solitary
houses
clinging
to
the
lower
*NL*
slopes
of
a
hill
whose
heights
were
buried
in
a
cloudy
darkness
shone
*NL*
out
like
little
boats
which
had
folded
their
sails
and
would
ride
at
*NL*
anchor
,
all
night
,
upon
the
sea
.
But
what
mattered
rain
or
storm
?
*NL*
In
summer
,
bad
weather
is
no
more
than
a
passing
fit
of
superficial
*NL*
ill-temper
expressed
by
the
permanent
,
underlying
fine
weather
;
a
very
*NL*
different
thing
from
the
fluid
and
unstable
`
fine
weather
'
of
winter
,
*NL*
its
very
opposite
,
in
fact
;
for
has
it
not
-LRB-
firmly
established
in
the
*NL*
soil
,
on
which
it
has
taken
solid
form
in
dense
masses
of
foliage
over
*NL*
which
the
rain
may
pour
in
torrents
without
weakening
the
resistance
*NL*
offered
by
their
real
and
lasting
happiness
-RRB-
hoisted
,
to
keep
them
*NL*
flying
throughout
the
season
,
in
the
village
streets
,
on
the
walls
of
*NL*
the
houses
and
in
their
gardens
,
its
silken
banners
,
violet
and
white
.
*NL*
Sitting
in
the
little
parlour
,
where
I
would
pass
the
time
until
dinner
*NL*
with
a
book
,
I
might
hear
the
water
dripping
from
our
chestnut-trees
,
*NL*
but
I
would
know
that
the
shower
would
only
glaze
and
brighten
the
*NL*
greenness
of
their
thick
,
crumpled
leaves
,
and
that
they
themselves
*NL*
had
undertaken
to
remain
there
,
like
pledges
of
summer
,
all
through
the
*NL*
rainy
night
,
to
assure
me
of
the
fine
weather
's
continuing
;
it
might
*NL*
rain
as
it
pleased
,
but
to-morrow
,
over
the
white
fence
of
Tansonville
,
*NL*
there
would
surge
and
flow
,
numerous
as
ever
,
a
sea
of
little
*NL*
heart-shaped
leaves
;
and
without
the
least
anxiety
I
could
watch
the
*NL*
poplar
in
the
Rue
des
Perchamps
praying
for
mercy
,
bowing
in
desperation
*NL*
before
the
storm
;
without
the
least
anxiety
I
could
hear
,
at
the
far
end
*NL*
of
the
garden
,
the
last
peals
of
thunder
growling
among
our
lilac-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
weather
was
bad
all
morning
,
my
family
would
abandon
the
idea
of
*NL*
a
walk
,
and
I
would
remain
at
home
.
But
,
later
on
,
I
formed
the
habit
*NL*
of
going
out
by
myself
on
such
days
,
and
walking
towards
*NL*
Méséglise-la-Vineuse
,
during
that
autumn
when
we
had
to
come
to
Combray
*NL*
to
settle
the
division
of
my
aunt
Léonie
's
estate
;
for
she
had
died
at
*NL*
last
,
leaving
both
parties
among
her
neighbours
triumphant
in
the
*NL*
fact
of
her
demise
--
those
who
had
insisted
that
her
mode
of
life
was
*NL*
enfeebling
and
must
ultimately
kill
her
,
and
,
equally
,
those
who
had
*NL*
always
maintained
that
she
suffered
from
some
disease
not
imaginary
,
*NL*
but
organic
,
by
the
visible
proof
of
which
the
most
sceptical
would
*NL*
be
obliged
to
own
themselves
convinced
,
once
she
had
succumbed
to
it
;
*NL*
causing
no
intense
grief
to
any
save
one
of
her
survivors
,
but
to
that
*NL*
one
a
grief
savage
in
its
violence
.
During
the
long
fortnight
of
my
*NL*
aunt
's
last
illness
Françoise
never
went
out
of
her
room
for
an
instant
,
*NL*
never
took
off
her
clothes
,
allowed
no
one
else
to
do
anything
for
my
*NL*
aunt
,
and
did
not
leave
her
body
until
it
was
actually
in
its
grave
.
*NL*
Then
,
at
last
,
we
understood
that
the
sort
of
terror
in
which
Françoise
*NL*
had
lived
of
my
aunt
's
harsh
words
,
her
suspicions
and
her
anger
,
had
*NL*
developed
in
her
a
sentiment
which
we
had
mistaken
for
hatred
,
and
which
*NL*
was
really
veneration
and
love
.
Her
true
mistress
,
whose
decisions
it
*NL*
had
been
impossible
to
foresee
,
from
whose
stratagems
it
had
been
*NL*
so
hard
to
escape
,
of
whose
good
nature
it
had
been
so
easy
to
take
*NL*
advantage
,
her
sovereign
,
her
mysterious
and
omnipotent
monarch
was
no
*NL*
more
.
Compared
with
such
a
mistress
we
counted
for
very
little
.
The
*NL*
time
had
long
passed
when
,
on
our
first
coming
to
spend
our
holidays
*NL*
at
Combray
,
we
had
been
of
equal
importance
,
in
Françoise
eyes
,
with
my
*NL*
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
that
autumn
my
parents
,
finding
the
days
so
fully
occupied
with
*NL*
the
legal
formalities
that
had
to
be
gone
through
,
and
discussions
with
*NL*
solicitors
and
farmers
,
that
they
had
little
time
for
walks
which
,
as
it
*NL*
happened
,
the
weather
made
precarious
,
began
to
let
me
go
,
without
them
,
*NL*
along
the
'M
éséglise
way
,
'
wrapped
up
in
a
huge
Highland
plaid
which
*NL*
protected
me
from
the
rain
,
and
which
I
was
all
the
more
ready
to
throw
*NL*
over
my
shoulders
because
I
felt
that
the
stripes
of
its
gaudy
tartan
*NL*
scandalised
Françoise
,
whom
it
was
impossible
to
convince
that
the
*NL*
colour
of
one
's
clothes
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
one
's
mourning
*NL*
for
the
dead
,
and
to
whom
the
grief
which
we
had
shewn
on
my
aunt
's
*NL*
death
was
wholly
unsatisfactory
,
since
we
had
not
entertained
the
*NL*
neighbours
to
a
great
funeral
banquet
,
and
did
not
adopt
a
special
tone
*NL*
when
we
spoke
of
her
,
while
I
at
times
might
be
heard
humming
a
tune
.
I
*NL*
am
sure
that
in
a
book
--
and
to
that
extent
my
feelings
were
closely
akin
*NL*
to
those
of
Françoise
--
such
a
conception
of
mourning
,
in
the
manner
*NL*
of
the
_
Chanson
de
Roland
_
and
of
the
porch
of
Saint-André-des-Champs
,
*NL*
would
have
seemed
most
attractive
.
But
the
moment
that
Françoise
herself
*NL*
approached
,
some
evil
spirit
would
urge
me
to
attempt
to
make
her
angry
,
*NL*
and
I
would
avail
myself
of
the
slightest
pretext
to
say
to
her
that
I
*NL*
regretted
my
aunt
's
death
because
she
had
been
a
good
woman
in
spite
of
*NL*
her
absurdities
,
but
not
in
the
least
because
she
was
my
aunt
;
that
*NL*
she
might
easily
have
been
my
aunt
and
yet
have
been
so
odious
that
her
*NL*
death
would
not
have
caused
me
a
moment
's
sorrow
;
statements
which
,
in
a
*NL*
book
,
would
have
struck
me
as
merely
fatuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
Françoise
then
,
inspired
like
a
poet
with
a
flood
of
confused
*NL*
reflections
upon
bereavement
,
grief
,
and
family
memories
,
were
to
*NL*
plead
her
inability
to
rebut
my
theories
,
saying
:
``
I
do
n't
know
how
to
*NL*
_
espress
_
myself
''
--
I
would
triumph
over
her
with
an
ironical
and
brutal
*NL*
common
sense
worthy
of
Dr.
Percepied
;
and
if
she
went
on
:
``
All
the
same
*NL*
she
was
a
_
geological
_
relation
;
there
is
always
the
respect
due
to
your
*NL*
_
geology
_
,
''
I
would
shrug
my
shoulders
and
say
:
``
It
is
really
very
good
*NL*
of
me
to
discuss
the
matter
with
an
illiterate
old
woman
who
can
not
*NL*
speak
her
own
language
,
''
adopting
,
to
deliver
judgment
on
Françoise
,
*NL*
the
mean
and
narrow
outlook
of
the
pedant
,
whom
those
who
are
most
*NL*
contemptuous
of
him
in
the
impartiality
of
their
own
minds
are
only
too
*NL*
prone
to
copy
when
they
are
obliged
to
play
a
part
upon
the
vulgar
stage
*NL*
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
walks
,
that
autumn
,
were
all
the
more
delightful
because
I
used
*NL*
to
take
them
after
long
hours
spent
over
a
book
.
When
I
was
tired
of
*NL*
reading
,
after
a
whole
morning
in
the
house
,
I
would
throw
my
plaid
*NL*
across
my
shoulders
and
set
out
;
my
body
,
which
in
a
long
spell
of
*NL*
enforced
immobility
had
stored
up
an
accumulation
of
vital
energy
,
was
*NL*
now
obliged
,
like
a
spinning-top
wound
and
let
go
,
to
spend
this
in
*NL*
every
direction
.
The
walls
of
houses
,
the
Tansonville
hedge
,
the
trees
*NL*
of
Roussainville
wood
,
the
bushes
against
which
Montjouvain
leaned
its
*NL*
back
,
all
must
bear
the
blows
of
my
walking-stick
or
umbrella
,
must
*NL*
hear
my
shouts
of
happiness
,
blows
and
shouts
being
indeed
no
more
than
*NL*
expressions
of
the
confused
ideas
which
exhilarated
me
,
and
which
,
not
*NL*
being
developed
to
the
point
at
which
they
might
rest
exposed
to
the
*NL*
light
of
day
,
rather
than
submit
to
a
slow
and
difficult
course
*NL*
of
elucidation
,
found
it
easier
and
more
pleasant
to
drift
into
an
*NL*
immediate
outlet
.
And
so
it
is
that
the
bulk
of
what
appear
to
be
the
*NL*
emotional
renderings
of
our
inmost
sensations
do
no
more
than
relieve
us
*NL*
of
the
burden
of
those
sensations
by
allowing
them
to
escape
from
us
in
*NL*
an
indistinct
form
which
does
not
teach
us
how
it
should
be
interpreted
.
*NL*
When
I
attempt
to
reckon
up
all
that
I
owe
to
the
'M
éséglise
way
,
'
all
*NL*
the
humble
discoveries
of
which
it
was
either
the
accidental
setting
or
*NL*
the
direct
inspiration
and
cause
,
I
am
reminded
that
it
was
in
that
same
*NL*
autumn
,
on
one
of
those
walks
,
near
the
bushy
precipice
which
guarded
*NL*
Montjouvain
from
the
rear
,
that
I
was
struck
for
the
first
time
by
*NL*
this
lack
of
harmony
between
our
impressions
and
their
normal
forms
of
*NL*
expression
.
After
an
hour
of
rain
and
wind
,
against
which
I
had
put
up
a
*NL*
brisk
fight
,
as
I
came
to
the
edge
of
the
Montjouvain
pond
,
and
reached
*NL*
a
little
hut
,
roofed
with
tiles
,
in
which
M.
Vinteuil
's
gardener
kept
*NL*
his
tools
,
the
sun
shone
out
again
,
and
its
golden
rays
,
washed
clean
*NL*
by
the
shower
,
blazed
once
more
in
the
sky
,
on
the
trees
,
on
the
wall
*NL*
of
the
hut
,
and
on
the
still
wet
tiles
of
the
roof
,
which
had
a
chicken
*NL*
perching
upon
its
ridge
.
The
wind
pulled
out
sideways
the
wild
grass
*NL*
that
grew
in
the
wall
,
and
the
chicken
's
downy
feathers
,
both
of
which
*NL*
things
let
themselves
float
upon
the
wind
's
breath
to
their
full
extent
,
*NL*
with
the
unresisting
submissiveness
of
light
and
lifeless
matter
.
The
*NL*
tiled
roof
cast
upon
the
pond
,
whose
reflections
were
now
clear
again
*NL*
in
the
sunlight
,
a
square
of
pink
marble
,
the
like
of
which
I
had
never
*NL*
observed
before
.
And
,
seeing
upon
the
water
,
where
it
reflected
the
*NL*
wall
,
a
pallid
smile
responding
to
the
smiling
sky
,
I
cried
aloud
in
my
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
brandishing
my
furled
umbrella
:
``
Damn
,
damn
,
damn
,
damn
!
''
*NL*
But
at
the
same
time
I
felt
that
I
was
in
duty
bound
not
to
content
*NL*
myself
with
these
unilluminating
words
,
but
to
endeavour
to
see
more
*NL*
clearly
into
the
sources
of
my
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
at
that
moment
,
too
--
thanks
to
a
peasant
who
went
past
,
*NL*
apparently
in
a
bad
enough
humour
already
,
but
more
so
when
he
nearly
*NL*
received
my
umbrella
in
his
face
,
and
who
replied
without
any
cordiality
*NL*
to
my
``
Fine
day
,
what
!
good
to
be
out
walking
!
''
--
that
I
learned
*NL*
that
identical
emotions
do
not
spring
up
in
the
hearts
of
all
men
*NL*
simultaneously
,
by
a
pre-established
order
.
Later
on
I
discovered
that
,
*NL*
whenever
I
had
read
for
too
long
and
was
in
a
mood
for
conversation
,
the
*NL*
friend
to
whom
I
would
be
burning
to
say
something
would
at
that
moment
*NL*
have
finished
indulging
himself
in
the
delights
of
conversation
,
and
*NL*
wanted
nothing
now
but
to
be
left
to
read
undisturbed
.
And
if
I
had
been
*NL*
thinking
with
affection
of
my
parents
,
and
forming
the
most
sensible
and
*NL*
proper
plans
for
giving
them
pleasure
,
they
would
have
been
using
*NL*
the
same
interval
of
time
to
discover
some
misdeed
that
I
had
already
*NL*
forgotten
,
and
would
begin
to
scold
me
severely
,
just
as
I
flung
myself
*NL*
upon
them
with
a
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
to
the
exhilaration
which
I
derived
from
being
alone
would
be
*NL*
added
an
alternative
feeling
,
so
that
I
could
not
be
clear
in
my
mind
to
*NL*
which
I
should
give
the
casting
vote
;
a
feeling
stimulated
by
the
desire
*NL*
to
see
rise
up
before
my
eyes
a
peasant-girl
whom
I
might
clasp
in
my
*NL*
arms
.
Coming
abruptly
,
and
without
giving
me
time
to
trace
it
accurately
*NL*
to
its
source
among
so
many
ideas
of
a
very
different
kind
,
the
pleasure
*NL*
which
accompanied
this
desire
seemed
only
a
degree
superior
to
what
was
*NL*
given
me
by
my
other
thoughts
.
I
found
an
additional
merit
in
everything
*NL*
that
was
in
my
mind
at
the
moment
,
in
the
pink
reflection
of
the
tiled
*NL*
roof
,
the
wild
grass
in
the
wall
,
the
village
of
Roussainville
into
*NL*
which
I
had
long
desired
to
penetrate
,
the
trees
of
its
wood
and
the
*NL*
steeple
of
its
church
,
created
in
them
by
this
fresh
emotion
which
made
*NL*
them
appear
more
desirable
only
because
I
thought
it
was
they
that
*NL*
had
provoked
it
,
and
which
seemed
only
to
wish
to
bear
me
more
swiftly
*NL*
towards
them
when
it
filled
my
sails
with
a
potent
,
unknown
,
and
*NL*
propitious
breeze
.
But
if
this
desire
that
a
woman
should
appear
added
*NL*
for
me
something
more
exalting
than
the
charms
of
nature
,
they
in
their
*NL*
turn
enlarged
what
I
might
,
in
the
woman
's
charm
,
have
found
too
much
*NL*
restricted
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
the
beauty
of
the
trees
was
hers
*NL*
also
,
and
that
,
as
for
the
spirit
of
those
horizons
,
of
the
village
of
*NL*
Roussainville
,
of
the
books
which
I
was
reading
that
year
,
it
was
her
*NL*
kiss
which
would
make
me
master
of
them
all
;
and
,
my
imagination
drawing
*NL*
strength
from
contact
with
my
sensuality
,
my
sensuality
expanding
*NL*
through
all
the
realms
of
my
imagination
,
my
desire
had
no
longer
any
*NL*
bounds
.
Moreover
--
just
as
in
moments
of
musing
contemplation
of
nature
,
*NL*
the
normal
actions
of
the
mind
being
suspended
,
and
our
abstract
ideas
*NL*
of
things
set
on
one
side
,
we
believe
with
the
profoundest
faith
in
the
*NL*
originality
,
in
the
individual
existence
of
the
place
in
which
we
may
*NL*
happen
to
be
--
the
passing
figure
which
my
desire
evoked
seemed
to
be
*NL*
not
any
one
example
of
the
general
type
of
`
woman
,
'
but
a
necessary
and
*NL*
natural
product
of
the
soil
.
For
at
that
time
everything
which
was
not
*NL*
myself
,
the
earth
and
the
creatures
upon
it
,
seemed
to
me
more
precious
,
*NL*
more
important
,
endowed
with
a
more
real
existence
than
they
appear
*NL*
to
full-grown
men
.
And
between
the
earth
and
its
creatures
I
made
*NL*
no
distinction
.
I
had
a
desire
for
a
peasant-girl
from
Méséglise
or
*NL*
Roussainville
,
for
a
fisher-girl
from
Balbec
,
just
as
I
had
a
desire
for
*NL*
Balbec
and
Méséglise
.
The
pleasure
which
those
girls
were
empowered
to
*NL*
give
me
would
have
seemed
less
genuine
,
I
should
have
had
no
faith
in
*NL*
it
any
longer
,
if
I
had
been
at
liberty
to
modify
its
conditions
as
I
*NL*
chose
.
To
meet
in
Paris
a
fisher-girl
from
Balbec
or
a
peasant-girl
from
*NL*
Méséglise
would
have
been
like
receiving
the
present
of
a
shell
which
*NL*
I
had
never
seen
upon
the
beach
,
or
of
a
fern
which
I
had
never
found
*NL*
among
the
woods
,
would
have
stripped
from
the
pleasure
which
she
was
*NL*
about
to
give
me
all
those
other
pleasures
in
the
thick
of
which
my
*NL*
imagination
had
enwrapped
her
.
But
to
wander
thus
among
the
woods
of
*NL*
Roussainville
without
a
peasant-girl
to
embrace
was
to
see
those
woods
*NL*
and
yet
know
nothing
of
their
secret
treasure
,
their
deep-hidden
beauty
.
*NL*
That
girl
whom
I
never
saw
save
dappled
with
the
shadows
of
their
*NL*
leaves
,
was
to
me
herself
a
plant
of
local
growth
,
only
taller
than
the
*NL*
rest
,
and
one
whose
structure
would
enable
me
to
approach
more
closely
*NL*
than
in
them
to
the
intimate
savour
of
the
land
from
which
she
had
*NL*
sprung
.
I
could
believe
this
all
the
more
readily
-LRB-
and
also
that
*NL*
the
caresses
by
which
she
would
bring
that
savour
to
my
senses
were
*NL*
themselves
of
a
particular
kind
,
yielding
a
pleasure
which
I
could
*NL*
never
derive
from
any
but
herself
-RRB-
since
I
was
still
,
and
must
for
long
*NL*
remain
,
in
that
period
of
life
when
one
has
not
yet
separated
the
fact
*NL*
of
this
sensual
pleasure
from
the
various
women
in
whose
company
one
has
*NL*
tasted
it
,
when
one
has
not
reduced
it
to
a
general
idea
which
makes
one
*NL*
regard
them
thenceforward
as
the
variable
instruments
of
a
pleasure
that
*NL*
is
always
the
same
.
Indeed
,
that
pleasure
does
not
exist
,
isolated
and
*NL*
formulated
in
the
consciousness
,
as
the
ultimate
object
with
which
one
*NL*
seeks
a
woman
's
company
,
or
as
the
cause
of
the
uneasiness
which
,
in
*NL*
anticipation
,
one
then
feels
.
Hardly
even
does
one
think
of
oneself
,
*NL*
but
only
how
to
escape
from
oneself
.
Obscurely
awaited
,
immanent
and
*NL*
concealed
,
it
rouses
to
such
a
paroxysm
,
at
the
moment
when
at
last
it
*NL*
makes
itself
felt
,
those
other
pleasures
which
we
find
in
the
tender
*NL*
glance
,
in
the
kiss
of
her
who
is
by
our
side
,
that
it
seems
to
us
,
more
*NL*
than
anything
else
,
a
sort
of
transport
of
gratitude
for
the
kindness
of
*NL*
heart
of
our
companion
and
for
her
touching
predilection
of
ourselves
,
*NL*
which
we
measure
by
the
benefits
,
by
the
happiness
that
she
showers
upon
*NL*
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
,
it
was
in
vain
that
I
implored
the
dungeon-keep
of
Roussainville
,
*NL*
that
I
begged
it
to
send
out
to
meet
me
some
daughter
of
its
village
,
*NL*
appealing
to
it
as
to
the
sole
confidant
to
whom
I
had
disclosed
my
*NL*
earliest
desire
when
,
from
the
top
floor
of
our
house
at
Combray
,
from
*NL*
the
little
room
that
smelt
of
orris-root
,
I
had
peered
out
and
seen
*NL*
nothing
but
its
tower
,
framed
in
the
square
of
the
half-opened
window
,
*NL*
while
,
with
the
heroic
scruples
of
a
traveller
setting
forth
for
*NL*
unknown
climes
,
or
of
a
desperate
wretch
hesitating
on
the
verge
of
*NL*
self-destruction
,
faint
with
emotion
,
I
explored
,
across
the
bounds
of
*NL*
my
own
experience
,
an
untrodden
path
which
,
I
believed
,
might
lead
me
to
*NL*
my
death
,
even
--
until
passion
spent
itself
and
left
me
shuddering
among
*NL*
the
sprays
of
flowering
currant
which
,
creeping
in
through
the
window
,
*NL*
tumbled
all
about
my
body
.
In
vain
I
called
upon
it
now
.
In
vain
I
*NL*
compressed
the
whole
landscape
into
my
field
of
vision
,
draining
it
with
*NL*
an
exhaustive
gaze
which
sought
to
extract
from
it
a
female
creature
.
I
*NL*
might
go
alone
as
far
as
the
porch
of
Saint-André-des-Champs
:
never
did
*NL*
I
find
there
the
girl
whom
I
should
inevitably
have
met
,
had
I
been
with
*NL*
my
grandfather
,
and
so
unable
to
engage
her
in
conversation
.
I
would
fix
*NL*
my
eyes
,
without
limit
of
time
,
upon
the
trunk
of
a
distant
tree
,
from
*NL*
behind
which
she
must
appear
and
spring
towards
me
;
my
closest
scrutiny
*NL*
left
the
horizon
barren
as
before
;
night
was
falling
;
without
any
hope
*NL*
now
would
I
concentrate
my
attention
,
as
though
to
force
up
out
of
it
*NL*
the
creatures
which
it
must
conceal
,
upon
that
sterile
soil
,
that
stale
*NL*
and
outworn
land
;
and
it
was
no
longer
in
lightness
of
heart
,
but
with
*NL*
sullen
anger
that
I
aimed
blows
at
the
trees
of
Roussainville
wood
,
from
*NL*
among
which
no
more
living
creatures
made
their
appearance
than
if
they
*NL*
had
been
trees
painted
on
the
stretched
canvas
background
of
a
panorama
,
*NL*
when
,
unable
to
resign
myself
to
having
to
return
home
without
having
*NL*
held
in
my
arms
the
woman
I
so
greatly
desired
,
I
was
yet
obliged
to
*NL*
retrace
my
steps
towards
Combray
,
and
to
admit
to
myself
that
the
chance
*NL*
of
her
appearing
in
my
path
grew
smaller
every
moment
.
And
if
she
had
*NL*
appeared
,
would
I
have
dared
to
speak
to
her
?
I
felt
that
she
would
have
*NL*
regarded
me
as
mad
,
for
I
no
longer
thought
of
those
desires
which
came
*NL*
to
me
on
my
walks
,
but
were
never
realized
,
as
being
shared
by
others
,
*NL*
or
as
having
any
existence
apart
from
myself
.
They
seemed
nothing
more
*NL*
now
than
the
purely
subjective
,
impotent
,
illusory
creatures
of
my
*NL*
temperament
.
They
were
in
no
way
connected
now
with
nature
,
with
the
*NL*
world
of
real
things
,
which
from
now
onwards
lost
all
its
charm
and
*NL*
significance
,
and
meant
no
more
to
my
life
than
a
purely
conventional
*NL*
framework
,
just
as
the
action
of
a
novel
is
framed
in
the
railway
*NL*
carriage
,
on
a
seat
of
which
a
traveller
is
reading
it
to
pass
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
is
perhaps
from
another
impression
which
I
received
at
*NL*
Mont-jouvain
,
some
years
later
,
an
impression
which
at
that
time
was
*NL*
without
meaning
,
that
there
arose
,
long
afterwards
,
my
idea
of
that
*NL*
cruel
side
of
human
passion
called
`
sadism
.
'
We
shall
see
,
in
due
*NL*
course
,
that
for
quite
another
reason
the
memory
of
this
impression
was
*NL*
to
play
an
important
part
in
my
life
.
It
was
during
a
spell
of
very
hot
*NL*
weather
;
my
parents
,
who
had
been
obliged
to
go
away
for
the
whole
day
,
*NL*
had
told
me
that
I
might
stay
out
as
late
as
I
pleased
;
and
having
*NL*
gone
as
far
as
the
Montjouvain
pond
,
where
I
enjoyed
seeing
again
the
*NL*
reflection
of
the
tiled
roof
of
the
hut
,
I
had
lain
down
in
the
shade
*NL*
and
gone
to
sleep
among
the
bushes
on
the
steep
slope
that
rose
up
*NL*
behind
the
house
,
just
where
I
had
waited
for
my
parents
,
years
before
,
*NL*
one
day
when
they
had
gone
to
call
on
M.
Vinteuil
.
It
was
almost
dark
*NL*
when
I
awoke
,
and
I
wished
to
rise
and
go
away
,
but
I
saw
Mlle.
Vinteuil
*NL*
-LRB-
or
thought
,
at
least
,
that
I
recognised
her
,
for
I
had
not
seen
her
*NL*
often
at
Combray
,
and
then
only
when
she
was
still
a
child
,
whereas
*NL*
she
was
now
growing
into
a
young
woman
-RRB-
,
who
probably
had
just
come
in
,
*NL*
standing
in
front
of
me
,
and
only
a
few
feet
away
from
me
,
in
that
room
*NL*
in
which
her
father
had
entertained
mine
,
and
which
she
had
now
made
*NL*
into
a
little
sitting-room
for
herself
.
The
window
was
partly
open
;
the
*NL*
lamp
was
lighted
;
I
could
watch
her
every
movement
without
her
being
*NL*
able
to
see
me
;
but
,
had
I
gone
away
,
I
must
have
made
a
rustling
sound
*NL*
among
the
bushes
,
she
would
have
heard
me
,
and
might
have
thought
that
I
*NL*
had
been
hiding
there
in
order
to
spy
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
deep
mourning
,
for
her
father
had
but
lately
died
.
We
had
*NL*
not
gone
to
see
her
;
my
mother
had
not
cared
to
go
,
on
account
of
that
*NL*
virtue
which
alone
in
her
fixed
any
bounds
to
her
benevolence
--
namely
,
*NL*
modesty
;
but
she
pitied
the
girl
from
the
depths
of
her
heart
.
My
*NL*
mother
had
not
forgotten
the
sad
end
of
M.
Vinteuil
's
life
,
his
complete
*NL*
absorption
,
first
in
having
to
play
both
mother
and
nursery-maid
to
his
*NL*
daughter
,
and
,
later
,
in
the
suffering
which
she
had
caused
him
;
she
*NL*
could
see
the
tortured
expression
which
was
never
absent
from
the
old
*NL*
man
's
face
in
those
terrible
last
years
;
she
knew
that
he
had
definitely
*NL*
abandoned
the
task
of
transcribing
in
fair
copies
the
whole
of
his
later
*NL*
work
,
the
poor
little
pieces
,
we
imagined
,
of
an
old
music-master
,
a
*NL*
retired
village
organist
,
which
,
we
assumed
,
were
of
little
or
no
value
*NL*
in
themselves
,
though
we
did
not
despise
them
,
because
they
were
of
such
*NL*
great
value
to
him
and
had
been
the
chief
motive
of
his
life
before
he
*NL*
sacrificed
them
to
his
daughter
;
pieces
which
,
being
mostly
not
even
*NL*
written
down
,
but
recorded
only
in
his
memory
,
while
the
rest
were
*NL*
scribbled
on
loose
sheets
of
paper
,
and
quite
illegible
,
must
now
remain
*NL*
unknown
for
ever
;
my
mother
thought
,
also
,
of
that
other
and
still
more
*NL*
cruel
renunciation
to
which
M.
Vinteuil
had
been
driven
,
that
of
seeing
*NL*
the
girl
happily
settled
,
with
an
honest
and
respectable
future
;
when
*NL*
she
called
to
mind
all
this
utter
and
crushing
misery
that
had
come
*NL*
upon
my
aunts
'
old
music-master
,
she
was
moved
to
very
real
grief
,
and
*NL*
shuddered
to
think
of
that
other
grief
,
so
different
in
its
bitterness
,
*NL*
which
Mlle.
Vinteuil
must
now
be
feeling
,
tinged
with
remorse
at
having
*NL*
virtually
killed
her
father
.
``
Poor
M.
Vinteuil
,
''
my
mother
would
say
,
*NL*
``
he
lived
for
his
daughter
,
and
now
he
has
died
for
her
,
without
getting
*NL*
his
reward
.
Will
he
get
it
now
,
I
wonder
,
and
in
what
form
?
It
can
only
*NL*
come
to
him
from
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
far
end
of
Mlle.
Vinteuil
's
sitting-room
,
on
the
mantelpiece
,
*NL*
stood
a
small
photograph
of
her
father
which
she
went
briskly
to
fetch
,
*NL*
just
as
the
sound
of
carriage
wheels
was
heard
from
the
road
outside
,
*NL*
then
flung
herself
down
on
a
sofa
and
drew
close
beside
her
a
little
*NL*
table
on
which
she
placed
the
photograph
,
just
as
,
long
ago
,
M.
Vinteuil
*NL*
had
`
placed
'
beside
him
the
piece
of
music
which
he
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
play
over
to
my
parents
.
And
then
her
friend
came
in
.
Mlle.
Vinteuil
*NL*
greeted
her
without
rising
,
clasping
her
hands
behind
her
head
,
and
*NL*
drew
her
body
to
one
side
of
the
sofa
,
as
though
to
`
make
room
.
'
But
no
*NL*
sooner
had
she
done
this
than
she
appeared
to
feel
that
she
was
perhaps
*NL*
suggesting
a
particular
position
to
her
friend
,
with
an
emphasis
which
*NL*
might
well
be
regarded
as
importunate
.
She
thought
that
her
friend
would
*NL*
prefer
,
no
doubt
,
to
sit
down
at
some
distance
from
her
,
upon
a
chair
;
*NL*
she
felt
that
she
had
been
indiscreet
;
her
sensitive
heart
took
fright
;
*NL*
stretching
herself
out
again
over
the
whole
of
the
sofa
,
she
closed
her
*NL*
eyes
and
began
to
yawn
,
so
as
to
indicate
that
it
was
a
desire
to
sleep
,
*NL*
and
that
alone
,
which
had
made
her
lie
down
there
.
Despite
the
rude
*NL*
and
hectoring
familiarity
with
which
she
treated
her
companion
I
could
*NL*
recognise
in
her
the
obsequious
and
reticent
advances
,
the
abrupt
*NL*
scruples
and
restraints
which
had
characterised
her
father
.
Presently
*NL*
she
rose
and
came
to
the
window
,
where
she
pretended
to
be
trying
to
*NL*
close
the
shutters
and
not
succeeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
them
open
,
''
said
her
friend
.
``
I
am
hot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
too
dreadful
!
People
will
see
us
,
''
Mlle.
Vinteuil
answered
.
*NL*
And
then
she
guessed
,
probably
,
that
her
friend
would
think
that
she
had
*NL*
uttered
these
words
simply
in
order
to
provoke
a
reply
in
certain
other
*NL*
words
,
which
she
seemed
,
indeed
,
to
wish
to
hear
spoken
,
but
,
from
*NL*
prudence
,
would
let
her
friend
be
the
first
to
speak
.
And
so
,
although
*NL*
I
could
not
see
her
face
clearly
enough
,
I
am
sure
that
the
expression
*NL*
must
have
appeared
on
it
which
my
grandmother
had
once
found
so
*NL*
delightful
,
when
she
hastily
went
on
:
``
When
I
say
`
see
us
'
I
mean
,
of
*NL*
course
,
see
us
reading
.
It
's
so
dreadful
to
think
that
in
every
trivial
*NL*
little
thing
you
do
some
one
may
be
overlooking
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
instinctive
generosity
of
her
nature
,
a
courtesy
beyond
her
*NL*
control
,
she
refrained
from
uttering
the
studied
words
which
,
she
had
*NL*
felt
,
were
indispensable
for
the
full
realisation
of
her
desire
.
And
*NL*
perpetually
,
in
the
depths
of
her
being
,
a
shy
and
suppliant
maiden
*NL*
would
kneel
before
that
other
element
,
the
old
campaigner
,
battered
but
*NL*
triumphant
,
would
intercede
with
him
and
oblige
him
to
retire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
it
is
so
extremely
likely
that
people
are
looking
at
us
at
*NL*
this
time
of
night
in
this
densely
populated
district
!
''
said
her
friend
,
*NL*
with
bitter
irony
.
``
And
what
if
they
are
?
''
she
went
on
,
feeling
bound
*NL*
to
annotate
with
a
malicious
yet
affectionate
wink
these
words
which
*NL*
she
was
repeating
,
out
of
good
nature
,
like
a
lesson
prepared
beforehand
*NL*
which
,
she
knew
,
it
would
please
Mlle.
Vinteuil
to
hear
.
``
And
what
if
*NL*
they
are
?
All
the
better
that
they
should
see
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mlle.
Vinteuil
shuddered
and
rose
to
her
feet
.
In
her
sensitive
*NL*
and
scrupulous
heart
she
was
ignorant
what
words
ought
to
flow
,
*NL*
spontaneously
,
from
her
lips
,
so
as
to
produce
the
scene
for
which
her
*NL*
eager
senses
clamoured
.
She
reached
out
as
far
as
she
could
across
the
*NL*
limitations
of
her
true
character
to
find
the
language
appropriate
to
*NL*
a
vicious
young
woman
such
as
she
longed
to
be
thought
,
but
the
*NL*
words
which
,
she
imagined
,
such
a
young
woman
might
have
uttered
with
*NL*
sincerity
sounded
unreal
in
her
own
mouth
.
And
what
little
she
allowed
*NL*
herself
to
say
was
said
in
a
strained
tone
,
in
which
her
ingrained
*NL*
timidity
paralysed
her
tendency
to
freedom
and
audacity
of
speech
;
while
*NL*
she
kept
on
interrupting
herself
with
:
``
You
're
sure
you
are
n't
cold
?
You
*NL*
are
n't
too
hot
?
You
do
n't
want
to
sit
and
read
by
yourself
?
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
ladyship
's
thoughts
seem
to
be
rather
`
warm
'
this
evening
,
''
she
*NL*
concluded
,
doubtless
repeating
a
phrase
which
she
had
heard
used
,
on
*NL*
some
earlier
occasion
,
by
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
V-shaped
opening
of
her
crape
bodice
Mlle.
Vinteuil
felt
the
*NL*
sting
of
her
friend
's
sudden
kiss
;
she
gave
a
little
scream
and
*NL*
ran
away
;
and
then
they
began
to
chase
one
another
about
the
room
,
*NL*
scrambling
over
the
furniture
,
their
wide
sleeves
fluttering
like
*NL*
wings
,
clucking
and
crowing
like
a
pair
of
amorous
fowls
.
At
last
Mlle.
*NL*
Vinteuil
fell
down
exhausted
upon
the
sofa
,
where
she
was
screened
from
*NL*
me
by
the
stooping
body
of
her
friend
.
But
the
latter
now
had
her
back
*NL*
turned
to
the
little
table
on
which
the
old
music-master
's
portrait
had
*NL*
been
arranged
.
Mlle.
Vinteuil
realised
that
her
friend
would
not
see
*NL*
it
unless
her
attention
were
drawn
to
it
,
and
so
exclaimed
,
as
if
she
*NL*
herself
had
just
noticed
it
for
the
first
time
:
``
Oh
!
there
's
my
father
's
*NL*
picture
looking
at
us
;
I
ca
n't
think
who
can
have
put
it
there
;
I
'm
sure
*NL*
I
've
told
them
twenty
times
,
that
is
not
the
proper
place
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
remembered
the
words
that
M.
Vinteuil
had
used
to
my
parents
in
*NL*
apologising
for
an
obtrusive
sheet
of
music
.
This
photograph
was
,
of
*NL*
course
,
in
common
use
in
their
ritual
observances
,
was
subjected
to
*NL*
daily
profanation
,
for
the
friend
replied
in
words
which
were
evidently
*NL*
a
liturgical
response
:
``
Let
him
stay
there
.
He
ca
n't
trouble
us
any
*NL*
longer
.
D'you
think
he
'd
start
whining
,
d'you
think
he
'd
pack
you
out
*NL*
of
the
house
if
he
could
see
you
now
,
with
the
window
open
,
the
ugly
old
*NL*
monkey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Mlle.
Vinteuil
replied
,
``
Oh
,
please
!
''
--
a
gentle
reproach
*NL*
which
testified
to
the
genuine
goodness
of
her
nature
,
not
that
it
*NL*
was
prompted
by
any
resentment
at
hearing
her
father
spoken
of
in
this
*NL*
fashion
-LRB-
for
that
was
evidently
a
feeling
which
she
had
trained
herself
,
*NL*
by
a
long
course
of
sophistries
,
to
keep
in
close
subjection
at
such
*NL*
moments
-RRB-
,
but
rather
because
it
was
the
bridle
which
,
so
as
to
avoid
all
*NL*
appearance
of
egotism
,
she
herself
used
to
curb
the
gratification
which
*NL*
her
friend
was
attempting
to
procure
for
her
.
It
may
well
have
been
,
*NL*
too
,
that
the
smiling
moderation
with
which
she
faced
and
answered
these
*NL*
blasphemies
,
that
this
tender
and
hypocritical
rebuke
appeared
to
her
*NL*
frank
and
generous
nature
as
a
particularly
shameful
and
seductive
form
*NL*
of
that
criminal
attitude
towards
life
which
she
was
endeavouring
to
*NL*
adopt
.
But
she
could
not
resist
the
attraction
of
being
treated
with
*NL*
affection
by
a
woman
who
had
just
shewn
herself
so
implacable
towards
*NL*
the
defenceless
dead
;
she
sprang
on
to
the
knees
of
her
friend
and
held
*NL*
out
a
chaste
brow
to
be
kissed
;
precisely
as
a
daughter
would
have
done
*NL*
to
her
mother
,
feeling
with
exquisite
joy
that
they
would
thus
,
between
*NL*
them
,
inflict
the
last
turn
of
the
screw
of
cruelty
,
in
robbing
M.
*NL*
Vinteuil
,
as
though
they
were
actually
rifling
his
tomb
,
of
the
sacred
*NL*
rights
of
fatherhood
.
Her
friend
took
the
girl
's
head
in
her
hands
and
*NL*
placed
a
kiss
on
her
brow
with
a
docility
prompted
by
the
real
affection
*NL*
she
had
for
Mlle.
Vinteuil
,
as
well
as
by
the
desire
to
bring
what
*NL*
distraction
she
could
into
the
dull
and
melancholy
life
of
an
orphan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
I
should
like
to
do
to
that
old
horror
?
''
she
said
,
*NL*
taking
up
the
photograph
.
She
murmured
in
Mlle.
Vinteuil
's
ear
something
*NL*
that
I
could
not
distinguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
You
would
never
dare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
dare
to
spit
on
it
?
On
that
?
''
shouted
the
friend
with
deliberate
*NL*
brutality
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
no
more
,
for
Mlle.
Vinteuil
,
who
now
seemed
weary
,
awkward
,
*NL*
preoccupied
,
sincere
,
and
rather
sad
,
came
back
to
the
window
and
drew
*NL*
the
shutters
close
;
but
I
knew
now
what
was
the
reward
that
M.
Vinteuil
,
*NL*
in
return
for
all
the
suffering
that
he
had
endured
in
his
lifetime
,
on
*NL*
account
of
his
daughter
,
had
received
from
her
after
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
I
have
since
reflected
that
if
M.
Vinteuil
had
been
able
to
be
*NL*
present
at
this
scene
,
he
might
still
,
and
in
spite
of
everything
,
have
*NL*
continued
to
believe
in
his
daughter
's
soundness
of
heart
,
and
that
he
*NL*
might
even
,
in
so
doing
,
have
been
not
altogether
wrong
.
It
was
true
*NL*
that
in
all
Mlle.
Vinteuil
's
actions
the
appearance
of
evil
was
so
*NL*
strong
and
so
consistent
that
it
would
have
been
hard
to
find
it
*NL*
exhibited
in
such
completeness
save
in
what
is
nowadays
called
a
*NL*
`
sadist
'
;
it
is
behind
the
footlights
of
a
Paris
theatre
,
and
not
under
*NL*
the
homely
lamp
of
an
actual
country
house
,
that
one
expects
to
see
a
*NL*
girl
leading
her
friend
on
to
spit
upon
the
portrait
of
a
father
who
has
*NL*
lived
and
died
for
nothing
and
no
one
but
herself
;
and
when
we
find
in
*NL*
real
life
a
desire
for
melodramatic
effect
,
it
is
generally
the
`
sadic
'
*NL*
instinct
that
is
responsible
for
it
.
It
is
possible
that
,
without
being
*NL*
in
the
least
inclined
towards
`
sadism
,
'
a
girl
might
have
shewn
the
*NL*
same
outrageous
cruelty
as
Mlle.
Vinteuil
in
desecrating
the
memory
and
*NL*
defying
the
wishes
of
her
dead
father
,
but
she
would
not
have
given
them
*NL*
deliberate
expression
in
an
act
so
crude
in
its
symbolism
,
so
lacking
*NL*
in
subtlety
;
the
criminal
element
in
her
behaviour
would
have
been
less
*NL*
evident
to
other
people
,
and
even
to
herself
,
since
she
would
not
have
*NL*
admitted
to
herself
that
she
was
doing
wrong
.
But
,
appearances
apart
,
in
*NL*
Mlle.
Vinteuil
's
soul
,
at
least
in
the
earlier
stages
,
the
evil
element
*NL*
was
probably
not
unmixed
.
A
`
sadist
'
of
her
kind
is
an
artist
in
evil
,
*NL*
which
a
wholly
wicked
person
could
not
be
,
for
in
that
case
the
evil
*NL*
would
not
have
been
external
,
it
would
have
seemed
quite
natural
to
her
,
*NL*
and
would
not
even
have
been
distinguishable
from
herself
;
and
as
for
*NL*
virtue
,
respect
for
the
dead
,
filial
obedience
,
since
she
would
never
*NL*
have
practised
the
cult
of
these
things
,
she
would
take
no
impious
*NL*
delight
in
their
profanation
.
`
Sadists
'
of
Mlle.
Vinteuil
's
sort
are
*NL*
creatures
so
purely
sentimental
,
so
virtuous
by
nature
,
that
even
*NL*
sensual
pleasure
appears
to
them
as
something
bad
,
a
privilege
reserved
*NL*
for
the
wicked
.
And
when
they
allow
themselves
for
a
moment
to
enjoy
it
*NL*
they
endeavour
to
impersonate
,
to
assume
all
the
outward
appearance
of
*NL*
wicked
people
,
for
themselves
and
their
partners
in
guilt
,
so
as
to
gain
*NL*
the
momentary
illusion
of
having
escaped
beyond
the
control
of
their
own
*NL*
gentle
and
scrupulous
natures
into
the
inhuman
world
of
pleasure
.
And
*NL*
I
could
understand
how
she
must
have
longed
for
such
an
escape
when
I
*NL*
realised
that
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
effect
it
.
At
the
moment
when
*NL*
she
wished
to
be
thought
the
very
antithesis
of
her
father
,
what
she
at
*NL*
once
suggested
to
me
were
the
mannerisms
,
in
thought
and
speech
,
of
*NL*
the
poor
old
music-master
.
Indeed
,
his
photograph
was
nothing
;
what
she
*NL*
really
desecrated
,
what
she
corrupted
into
ministering
to
her
pleasures
,
*NL*
but
what
remained
between
them
and
her
and
prevented
her
from
any
*NL*
direct
enjoyment
of
them
,
was
the
likeness
between
her
face
and
his
,
his
*NL*
mother
's
blue
eyes
which
he
had
handed
down
to
her
,
like
some
trinket
to
*NL*
be
kept
in
the
family
,
those
little
friendly
movements
and
inclinations
*NL*
which
set
up
between
the
viciousness
of
Mlle.
Vinteuil
and
herself
a
*NL*
phraseology
,
a
mentality
not
designed
for
vice
,
which
made
her
regard
it
*NL*
as
not
in
any
way
different
from
the
numberless
little
social
duties
and
*NL*
courtesies
to
which
she
must
devote
herself
every
day
.
It
was
not
evil
*NL*
that
gave
her
the
idea
of
pleasure
,
that
seemed
to
her
attractive
;
it
*NL*
was
pleasure
,
rather
,
that
seemed
evil
.
And
as
,
every
time
that
she
*NL*
indulged
in
it
,
pleasure
came
to
her
attended
by
evil
thoughts
such
as
,
*NL*
ordinarily
,
had
no
place
in
her
virtuous
mind
,
she
came
at
length
to
*NL*
see
in
pleasure
itself
something
diabolical
,
to
identify
it
with
Evil
.
*NL*
Perhaps
Mlle.
Vinteuil
felt
that
at
heart
her
friend
was
not
altogether
*NL*
bad
,
not
really
sincere
when
she
gave
vent
to
those
blasphemous
*NL*
utterances
.
At
any
rate
,
she
had
the
pleasure
of
receiving
those
kisses
*NL*
on
her
brow
,
those
smiles
,
those
glances
;
all
feigned
,
perhaps
,
but
akin
*NL*
in
their
base
and
vicious
mode
of
expression
to
those
which
would
have
*NL*
been
discernible
on
the
face
of
a
creature
formed
not
out
of
kindness
*NL*
and
long-suffering
,
but
out
of
self-indulgence
and
cruelty
.
She
was
*NL*
able
to
delude
herself
for
a
moment
into
believing
that
she
was
indeed
*NL*
amusing
herself
in
the
way
in
which
,
with
so
unnatural
an
accomplice
,
a
*NL*
girl
might
amuse
herself
who
really
did
experience
that
savage
antipathy
*NL*
towards
her
father
's
memory
.
Perhaps
she
would
not
have
thought
of
*NL*
wickedness
as
a
state
so
rare
,
so
abnormal
,
so
exotic
,
one
which
it
was
*NL*
so
refreshing
to
visit
,
had
she
been
able
to
distinguish
in
herself
,
*NL*
as
in
all
her
fellow-men
and
women
,
that
indifference
to
the
sufferings
*NL*
which
they
cause
which
,
whatever
names
else
be
given
it
,
is
the
one
*NL*
true
,
terrible
and
lasting
form
of
cruelty
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
'M
éséglise
way
'
was
so
easy
,
it
was
a
very
different
matter
when
*NL*
we
took
the
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
for
that
meant
a
long
walk
,
and
we
must
*NL*
make
sure
,
first
,
of
the
weather
.
When
we
seemed
to
have
entered
upon
a
*NL*
spell
of
fine
days
,
when
Françoise
,
in
desperation
that
not
a
drop
was
*NL*
falling
upon
the
`
poor
crops
,
'
gazing
up
at
the
sky
and
seeing
there
*NL*
only
a
little
white
cloud
floating
here
and
there
upon
its
calm
,
azure
*NL*
surface
,
groaned
aloud
and
exclaimed
:
``
You
would
say
they
were
nothing
*NL*
more
nor
less
than
a
lot
of
dogfish
swimming
about
and
sticking
up
their
*NL*
snouts
!
Ah
,
they
never
think
of
making
it
rain
a
little
for
the
poor
*NL*
labourers
!
And
then
when
the
corn
is
all
ripe
,
down
it
will
come
,
*NL*
rattling
all
over
the
place
,
and
think
no
more
of
where
it
is
falling
*NL*
than
if
it
was
on
the
sea
!
''
--
when
my
father
's
appeals
to
the
gardener
*NL*
had
met
with
the
same
encouraging
answer
several
times
in
succession
,
*NL*
then
some
one
would
say
,
at
dinner
:
``
To-morrow
,
if
the
weather
holds
,
*NL*
we
might
go
the
Guermantes
way
.
''
And
off
we
would
set
,
immediately
after
*NL*
luncheon
,
through
the
little
garden
gate
which
dropped
us
into
the
Rue
*NL*
des
Perchamps
,
narrow
and
bent
at
a
sharp
angle
,
dotted
with
grass-plots
*NL*
over
which
two
or
three
wasps
would
spend
the
day
botanising
,
a
street
*NL*
as
quaint
as
its
name
,
from
which
its
odd
characteristics
and
its
*NL*
personality
were
,
I
felt
,
derived
;
a
street
for
which
one
might
search
*NL*
in
vain
through
the
Combray
of
to-day
,
for
the
public
school
now
rises
*NL*
upon
its
site
.
But
in
my
dreams
of
Combray
-LRB-
like
those
architects
,
*NL*
pupils
of
Viollet-le-Duc
,
who
,
fancying
that
they
can
detect
,
beneath
*NL*
a
Renaissance
rood-loft
and
an
eighteenth-century
altar
,
traces
of
a
*NL*
Norman
choir
,
restore
the
whole
church
to
the
state
in
which
it
probably
*NL*
was
in
the
twelfth
century
-RRB-
I
leave
not
a
stone
of
the
modern
edifice
*NL*
standing
,
I
pierce
through
it
and
`
restore
'
the
Rue
des
Perchamps
.
And
*NL*
for
such
reconstruction
memory
furnishes
me
with
more
detailed
guidance
*NL*
than
is
generally
at
the
disposal
of
restorers
;
the
pictures
which
it
*NL*
has
preserved
--
perhaps
the
last
surviving
in
the
world
to-day
,
and
soon
*NL*
to
follow
the
rest
into
oblivion
--
of
what
Combray
looked
like
in
my
*NL*
childhood
's
days
;
pictures
which
,
simply
because
it
was
the
old
Combray
*NL*
that
traced
their
outlines
upon
my
mind
before
it
vanished
,
are
as
*NL*
moving
--
if
I
may
compare
a
humble
landscape
with
those
glorious
works
,
*NL*
reproductions
of
which
my
grandmother
was
so
fond
of
bestowing
on
me
--
as
*NL*
those
old
engravings
of
the
`
Cenacolo
,
'
or
that
painting
by
Gentile
*NL*
Bellini
,
in
which
one
sees
,
in
a
state
in
which
they
no
longer
exist
,
*NL*
the
masterpiece
of
Leonardo
and
the
portico
of
Saint
Mark
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
would
pass
,
in
the
Rue
de
l'Oiseau
,
before
the
old
hostelry
of
the
*NL*
Oiseau
Flesché
,
into
whose
great
courtyard
,
once
upon
a
time
,
would
*NL*
rumble
the
coaches
of
the
Duchesses
de
Montpensier
,
de
Guermantes
,
*NL*
and
de
Montmorency
,
when
they
had
to
come
down
to
Combray
for
some
*NL*
litigation
with
their
farmers
,
or
to
receive
homage
from
them
.
We
would
*NL*
come
at
length
to
the
Mall
,
among
whose
treetops
I
could
distinguish
the
*NL*
steeple
of
Saint-Hilaire
.
And
I
should
have
liked
to
be
able
to
sit
down
*NL*
and
spend
the
whole
day
there
,
reading
and
listening
to
the
bells
,
for
*NL*
it
was
so
charming
there
and
so
quiet
that
,
when
an
hour
struck
,
you
*NL*
would
have
said
not
that
it
broke
in
upon
the
calm
of
the
day
,
but
that
*NL*
it
relieved
the
day
of
its
superfluity
,
and
that
the
steeple
,
with
the
*NL*
indolent
,
painstaking
exactitude
of
a
person
who
has
nothing
else
to
do
,
*NL*
had
simply
,
in
order
to
squeeze
out
and
let
fall
the
few
golden
drops
*NL*
which
had
slowly
and
naturally
accumulated
in
the
hot
sunlight
,
pressed
,
*NL*
at
a
given
moment
,
the
distended
surface
of
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
charm
of
the
`
Guermantes
'
way
was
that
we
had
beside
us
,
*NL*
almost
all
the
time
,
the
course
of
the
Vivonne
.
We
crossed
it
first
,
ten
*NL*
minutes
after
leaving
the
house
,
by
a
foot-bridge
called
the
Pont-Vieux
.
*NL*
And
every
year
,
when
we
arrived
at
Combray
,
on
Easter
morning
,
after
the
*NL*
sermon
,
if
the
weather
was
fine
,
I
would
run
there
to
see
-LRB-
amid
all
the
*NL*
disorder
that
prevails
on
the
morning
of
a
great
festival
,
the
gorgeous
*NL*
preparations
for
which
make
the
everyday
household
utensils
that
they
*NL*
have
not
contrived
to
banish
seem
more
sordid
than
ever
-RRB-
the
river
*NL*
flowing
past
,
sky-blue
already
between
banks
still
black
and
bare
,
its
*NL*
only
companions
a
clump
of
daffodils
,
come
out
before
their
time
,
a
few
*NL*
primroses
,
the
first
in
flower
,
while
here
and
there
burned
the
blue
*NL*
flame
of
a
violet
,
its
stem
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
the
drop
of
*NL*
perfume
stored
in
its
tiny
horn
.
The
Pont-Vieux
led
to
a
tow-path
which
,
*NL*
at
this
point
,
would
be
overhung
in
summer
by
the
bluish
foliage
of
a
*NL*
hazel
,
under
which
a
fisherman
in
a
straw
hat
seemed
to
have
taken
*NL*
root
.
At
Combray
,
where
I
knew
everyone
,
and
could
always
detect
the
*NL*
blacksmith
or
grocer
's
boy
through
his
disguise
of
a
beadle
's
uniform
*NL*
or
chorister
's
surplice
,
this
fisherman
was
the
only
person
whom
I
was
*NL*
never
able
to
identify
.
He
must
have
known
my
family
,
for
he
used
to
*NL*
raise
his
hat
when
we
passed
;
and
then
I
would
always
be
just
on
the
*NL*
point
of
asking
his
name
,
when
some
one
would
make
a
sign
to
me
to
be
*NL*
quiet
,
or
I
would
frighten
the
fish
.
We
would
follow
the
tow-path
which
*NL*
ran
along
the
top
of
a
steep
bank
,
several
feet
above
the
stream
.
The
*NL*
ground
on
the
other
side
was
lower
,
and
stretched
in
a
series
of
broad
*NL*
meadows
as
far
as
the
village
and
even
to
the
distant
railway-station
.
*NL*
Over
these
were
strewn
the
remains
,
half-buried
in
the
long
grass
,
of
*NL*
the
castle
of
the
old
Counts
of
Combray
,
who
,
during
the
Middle
Ages
,
*NL*
had
had
on
this
side
the
course
of
the
Vivonne
as
a
barrier
and
defence
*NL*
against
attack
from
the
Lords
of
Guermantes
and
Abbots
of
Martinville
.
*NL*
Nothing
was
left
now
but
a
few
stumps
of
towers
,
hummocks
upon
the
broad
*NL*
surface
of
the
fields
,
hardly
visible
,
broken
battlements
over
which
,
in
*NL*
their
day
,
the
bowmen
had
hurled
down
stones
,
the
watchmen
had
gazed
out
*NL*
over
Novepont
,
Clairefontaine
,
Martinville-le-Sec
,
Bailleau-l'Exempt
,
*NL*
fiefs
all
of
them
of
Guermantes
,
a
ring
in
which
Combray
was
locked
;
*NL*
but
fallen
among
the
grass
now
,
levelled
with
the
ground
,
climbed
and
*NL*
commanded
by
boys
from
the
Christian
Brothers
'
school
,
who
came
there
*NL*
in
their
playtime
,
or
with
lesson-books
to
be
conned
;
emblems
of
a
past
*NL*
that
had
sunk
down
and
well-nigh
vanished
under
the
earth
,
that
lay
by
*NL*
the
water
's
edge
now
,
like
an
idler
taking
the
air
,
yet
giving
me
strong
*NL*
food
for
thought
,
making
the
name
of
Combray
connote
to
me
not
the
*NL*
little
town
of
to-day
only
,
but
an
historic
city
vastly
different
,
*NL*
seizing
and
holding
my
imagination
by
the
remote
,
incomprehensible
*NL*
features
which
it
half-concealed
beneath
a
spangled
veil
of
buttercups
.
*NL*
For
the
buttercups
grew
past
numbering
on
this
spot
which
they
had
*NL*
chosen
for
their
games
among
the
grass
,
standing
singly
,
in
couples
,
in
*NL*
whole
companies
,
yellow
as
the
yolk
of
eggs
,
and
glowing
with
an
added
*NL*
lustre
,
I
felt
,
because
,
being
powerless
to
consummate
with
my
palate
*NL*
the
pleasure
which
the
sight
of
them
never
failed
to
give
me
,
I
would
*NL*
let
it
accumulate
as
my
eyes
ranged
over
their
gilded
expanse
,
until
*NL*
it
had
acquired
the
strength
to
create
in
my
mind
a
fresh
example
of
*NL*
absolute
,
unproductive
beauty
;
and
so
it
had
been
from
my
earliest
*NL*
childhood
,
when
from
the
tow-path
I
had
stretched
out
my
arms
towards
*NL*
them
,
before
even
I
could
pronounce
their
charming
name
--
a
name
fit
for
*NL*
the
Prince
in
some
French
fairy-tale
;
colonists
,
perhaps
,
in
some
far
*NL*
distant
century
from
Asia
,
but
naturalised
now
for
ever
in
the
village
,
*NL*
well
satisfied
with
their
modest
horizon
,
rejoicing
in
the
sunshine
*NL*
and
the
water
's
edge
,
faithful
to
their
little
glimpse
of
the
*NL*
railway-station
;
yet
keeping
,
none
the
less
,
as
do
some
of
our
old
*NL*
paintings
,
in
their
plebeian
simplicity
,
a
poetic
scintillation
from
the
*NL*
golden
East
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
amuse
myself
by
watching
the
glass
jars
which
the
boys
used
*NL*
to
lower
into
the
Vivonne
,
to
catch
minnows
,
and
which
,
filled
by
the
*NL*
current
of
the
stream
,
in
which
they
themselves
also
were
enclosed
,
at
*NL*
once
`
containers
'
whose
transparent
sides
were
like
solidified
water
*NL*
and
`
contents
'
plunged
into
a
still
larger
container
of
liquid
,
*NL*
flowing
crystal
,
suggested
an
image
of
coolness
more
delicious
and
more
*NL*
provoking
than
the
same
water
in
the
same
jars
would
have
done
,
standing
*NL*
upon
a
table
laid
for
dinner
,
by
shewing
it
as
perpetually
in
flight
*NL*
between
the
impalpable
water
,
in
which
my
hands
could
not
arrest
it
,
and
*NL*
the
insoluble
glass
,
in
which
my
palate
could
not
enjoy
it
.
I
decided
*NL*
that
I
would
come
there
again
with
a
line
and
catch
fish
;
I
begged
for
*NL*
and
obtained
a
morsel
of
bread
from
our
luncheon
basket
;
and
threw
into
*NL*
the
Vivonne
pellets
which
had
the
power
,
it
seemed
,
to
bring
about
a
*NL*
chemical
precipitation
,
for
the
water
at
once
grew
solid
round
about
*NL*
them
in
oval
clusters
of
emaciated
tadpoles
,
which
until
then
it
had
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
been
holding
in
solution
,
invisible
,
but
ready
and
alert
to
enter
*NL*
the
stage
of
crystallisation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
course
of
the
Vivonne
became
choked
with
water-plants
.
*NL*
At
first
they
appeared
singly
,
a
lily
,
for
instance
,
which
the
current
,
*NL*
across
whose
path
it
had
unfortunately
grown
,
would
never
leave
at
rest
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
so
that
,
like
a
ferry-boat
mechanically
propelled
,
it
*NL*
would
drift
over
to
one
bank
only
to
return
to
the
other
,
eternally
*NL*
repeating
its
double
journey
.
Thrust
towards
the
bank
,
its
stalk
would
*NL*
be
straightened
out
,
lengthened
,
strained
almost
to
breaking-point
until
*NL*
the
current
again
caught
it
,
its
green
moorings
swung
back
over
their
*NL*
anchorage
and
brought
the
unhappy
plant
to
what
might
fitly
be
called
*NL*
its
starting-point
,
since
it
was
fated
not
to
rest
there
a
moment
before
*NL*
moving
off
once
again
.
I
would
still
find
it
there
,
on
one
walk
after
*NL*
another
,
always
in
the
same
helpless
state
,
suggesting
certain
victims
*NL*
of
neurasthenia
,
among
whom
my
grandfather
would
have
included
my
aunt
*NL*
Léonie
,
who
present
without
modification
,
year
after
year
,
the
spectacle
*NL*
of
their
odd
and
unaccountable
habits
,
which
they
always
imagine
*NL*
themselves
to
be
on
the
point
of
shaking
off
,
but
which
they
always
*NL*
retain
to
the
end
;
caught
in
the
treadmill
of
their
own
maladies
and
*NL*
eccentricities
,
their
futile
endeavours
to
escape
serve
only
to
actuate
*NL*
its
mechanism
,
to
keep
in
motion
the
clockwork
of
their
strange
,
*NL*
ineluctable
,
fatal
daily
round
.
Such
as
these
was
the
water-lily
,
*NL*
and
also
like
one
of
those
wretches
whose
peculiar
torments
,
repeated
*NL*
indefinitely
throughout
eternity
,
aroused
the
curiosity
of
Dante
,
who
*NL*
would
have
inquired
of
them
at
greater
length
and
in
fuller
detail
from
*NL*
the
victims
themselves
,
had
not
Virgil
,
striding
on
ahead
,
obliged
him
*NL*
to
hasten
after
him
at
full
speed
,
as
I
must
hasten
after
my
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
farther
on
the
current
slackened
,
where
the
stream
ran
through
a
*NL*
property
thrown
open
to
the
public
by
its
owner
,
who
had
made
a
hobby
of
*NL*
aquatic
gardening
,
so
that
the
little
ponds
into
which
the
Vivonne
was
*NL*
here
diverted
were
aflower
with
water-lilies
.
As
the
banks
at
this
*NL*
point
were
thickly
wooded
,
the
heavy
shade
of
the
trees
gave
the
water
a
*NL*
background
which
was
ordinarily
dark
green
,
although
sometimes
,
when
we
*NL*
were
coming
home
on
a
calm
evening
after
a
stormy
afternoon
,
I
have
seen
*NL*
in
its
depths
a
clear
,
crude
blue
that
was
almost
violet
,
suggesting
a
*NL*
floor
of
Japanese
cloisonné
.
Here
and
there
,
on
the
surface
,
floated
,
*NL*
blushing
like
a
strawberry
,
the
scarlet
heart
of
a
lily
set
in
a
ring
of
*NL*
white
petals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
these
the
flowers
were
more
frequent
,
but
paler
,
less
glossy
,
*NL*
more
thickly
seeded
,
more
tightly
folded
,
and
disposed
,
by
accident
,
in
*NL*
festoons
so
graceful
that
I
would
fancy
I
saw
floating
upon
the
stream
,
*NL*
as
though
after
the
dreary
stripping
of
the
decorations
used
in
some
*NL*
Watteau
festival
,
moss-roses
in
loosened
garlands
.
Elsewhere
a
corner
*NL*
seemed
to
be
reserved
for
the
commoner
kinds
of
lily
;
of
a
neat
pink
or
*NL*
white
like
rocket-flowers
,
washed
clean
like
porcelain
,
with
housewifely
*NL*
care
;
while
,
a
little
farther
again
,
were
others
,
pressed
close
together
*NL*
in
a
floating
garden-bed
,
as
though
pansies
had
flown
out
of
a
garden
*NL*
like
butterflies
and
were
hovering
with
blue
and
burnished
wings
over
*NL*
the
transparent
shadowiness
of
this
watery
border
;
this
skiey
border
*NL*
also
,
for
it
set
beneath
the
flowers
a
soil
of
a
colour
more
precious
,
*NL*
more
moving
than
their
own
;
and
both
in
the
afternoon
,
when
it
sparkled
*NL*
beneath
the
lilies
in
the
kaleidoscope
of
a
happiness
silent
,
restless
,
*NL*
and
alert
,
and
towards
evening
,
when
it
was
filled
like
a
distant
heaven
*NL*
with
the
roseate
dreams
of
the
setting
sun
,
incessantly
changing
and
*NL*
ever
remaining
in
harmony
,
about
the
more
permanent
colour
of
the
*NL*
flowers
themselves
,
with
the
utmost
profundity
,
evanescence
,
and
*NL*
mystery
--
with
a
quiet
suggestion
of
infinity
;
afternoon
or
evening
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
have
set
them
flowering
in
the
heart
of
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
leaving
this
park
the
Vivonne
began
to
flow
again
more
swiftly
.
*NL*
How
often
have
I
watched
,
and
longed
to
imitate
,
when
I
should
be
free
*NL*
to
live
as
I
chose
,
a
rower
who
had
shipped
his
oars
and
lay
stretched
*NL*
out
on
his
back
,
his
head
down
,
in
the
bottom
of
his
boat
,
letting
it
*NL*
drift
with
the
current
,
seeing
nothing
but
the
sky
which
slipped
quietly
*NL*
above
him
,
shewing
upon
his
features
a
foretaste
of
happiness
and
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
would
sit
down
among
the
irises
at
the
water
's
edge
.
In
the
holiday
*NL*
sky
a
lazy
cloud
streamed
out
to
its
full
length
.
Now
and
then
,
crushed
*NL*
by
the
burden
of
idleness
,
a
carp
would
heave
up
out
of
the
water
,
with
*NL*
an
anxious
gasp
.
It
was
time
for
us
to
feed
.
Before
starting
homewards
*NL*
we
would
sit
for
a
long
time
there
,
eating
fruit
and
bread
and
*NL*
chocolate
,
on
the
grass
,
over
which
came
to
our
ears
,
horizontal
,
faint
,
*NL*
but
solid
still
and
metallic
,
the
sound
of
the
bells
of
Saint-Hilaire
,
*NL*
which
had
melted
not
at
all
in
the
atmosphere
it
was
so
well
accustomed
*NL*
to
traverse
,
but
,
broken
piecemeal
by
the
successive
palpitation
of
all
*NL*
their
sonorous
strokes
,
throbbed
as
it
brushed
the
flowers
at
our
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
at
the
water
's
edge
and
embedded
in
trees
,
we
would
come
upon
*NL*
a
house
of
the
kind
called
`
pleasure
houses
,
'
isolated
and
lost
,
seeing
*NL*
nothing
of
the
world
,
save
the
river
which
bathed
its
feet
.
A
young
*NL*
woman
,
whose
pensive
face
and
fashionable
veils
did
not
suggest
a
local
*NL*
origin
,
and
who
had
doubtless
come
there
,
in
the
popular
phrase
,
`
to
*NL*
bury
herself
,
'
to
taste
the
bitter
sweetness
of
feeling
that
her
name
,
*NL*
and
still
more
the
name
of
him
whose
heart
she
had
once
held
,
but
had
*NL*
been
unable
to
keep
,
were
unknown
there
,
stood
framed
in
a
window
from
*NL*
which
she
had
no
outlook
beyond
the
boat
that
was
moored
beside
her
*NL*
door
.
She
raised
her
eyes
with
an
air
of
distraction
when
she
heard
,
*NL*
through
the
trees
that
lined
the
bank
,
the
voices
of
passers-by
of
whom
,
*NL*
before
they
came
in
sight
,
she
might
be
certain
that
never
had
they
*NL*
known
,
nor
would
they
know
,
the
faithless
lover
,
that
nothing
in
their
*NL*
past
lives
bore
his
imprint
,
which
nothing
in
their
future
would
have
*NL*
occasion
to
receive
.
One
felt
that
in
her
renunciation
of
life
she
had
*NL*
willingly
abandoned
those
places
in
which
she
would
at
least
have
been
*NL*
able
to
see
him
whom
she
loved
,
for
others
where
he
had
never
trod
.
And
*NL*
I
watched
her
,
as
she
returned
from
some
walk
along
a
road
where
she
had
*NL*
known
that
he
would
not
appear
,
drawing
from
her
submissive
fingers
long
*NL*
gloves
of
a
precious
,
useless
charm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
,
in
the
course
of
our
walks
along
the
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
might
*NL*
we
penetrate
as
far
as
the
source
of
the
Vivonne
,
of
which
I
had
often
*NL*
thought
,
which
had
in
my
mind
so
abstract
,
so
ideal
an
existence
,
that
I
*NL*
had
been
as
much
surprised
when
some
one
told
me
that
it
was
actually
*NL*
to
be
found
in
the
same
department
,
and
at
a
given
number
of
miles
from
*NL*
Combray
,
as
I
had
been
on
the
day
when
I
had
learned
that
there
was
*NL*
another
fixed
point
somewhere
on
the
earth
's
surface
,
where
,
according
*NL*
to
the
ancients
,
opened
the
jaws
of
Hell
.
Nor
could
we
ever
reach
that
*NL*
other
goal
,
to
which
I
longed
so
much
to
attain
,
Guermantes
itself
.
I
*NL*
knew
that
it
was
the
residence
of
its
proprietors
,
the
Duc
and
Duchesse
*NL*
de
Guermantes
,
I
knew
that
they
were
real
personages
who
did
actually
*NL*
exist
,
but
whenever
I
thought
about
them
I
pictured
them
to
myself
*NL*
either
in
tapestry
,
as
was
the
`
Coronation
of
Esther
'
which
hung
in
our
*NL*
church
,
or
else
in
changing
,
rainbow
colours
,
as
was
Gilbert
the
Bad
in
*NL*
his
window
,
where
he
passed
from
cabbage
green
,
when
I
was
dipping
my
*NL*
fingers
in
the
holy
water
stoup
,
to
plum
blue
when
I
had
reached
our
row
*NL*
of
chairs
,
or
again
altogether
impalpable
,
like
the
image
of
Geneviève
*NL*
de
Brabant
,
ancestress
of
the
Guermantes
family
,
which
the
magic
lantern
*NL*
sent
wandering
over
the
curtains
of
my
room
or
flung
aloft
upon
the
*NL*
ceiling
--
in
short
,
always
wrapped
in
the
mystery
of
the
Merovingian
age
,
*NL*
and
bathed
,
as
in
a
sunset
,
in
the
orange
light
which
glowed
from
the
*NL*
resounding
syllable
`
antes
.
'
And
if
,
in
spite
of
that
,
they
were
for
*NL*
me
,
in
their
capacity
as
a
duke
and
a
duchess
,
real
people
,
though
of
*NL*
an
unfamiliar
kind
,
this
ducal
personality
was
in
its
turn
enormously
*NL*
distended
,
immaterialised
,
so
as
to
encircle
and
contain
that
Guermantes
*NL*
of
which
they
were
duke
and
duchess
,
all
that
sunlit
`
Guermantes
way
'
*NL*
of
our
walks
,
the
course
of
the
Vivonne
,
its
water-lilies
and
its
*NL*
overshadowing
trees
,
and
an
endless
series
of
hot
summer
afternoons
.
*NL*
And
I
knew
that
they
bore
not
only
the
titles
of
Duc
and
Duchesse
de
*NL*
Guermantes
,
but
that
since
the
fourteenth
century
,
when
,
after
vain
*NL*
attempts
to
conquer
its
earlier
lords
in
battle
,
they
had
allied
*NL*
themselves
by
marriage
,
and
so
became
Counts
of
Combray
,
the
first
*NL*
citizens
,
consequently
,
of
the
place
,
and
yet
the
only
ones
among
*NL*
its
citizens
who
did
not
reside
in
it
--
Comtes
de
Combray
,
possessing
*NL*
Combray
,
threading
it
on
their
string
of
names
and
titles
,
absorbing
it
*NL*
in
their
personalities
,
and
illustrating
,
no
doubt
,
in
themselves
that
*NL*
strange
and
pious
melancholy
which
was
peculiar
to
Combray
;
proprietors
*NL*
of
the
town
,
though
not
of
any
particular
house
there
;
dwelling
,
*NL*
presumably
,
out
of
doors
,
in
the
street
,
between
heaven
and
earth
,
like
*NL*
that
Gilbert
de
Guermantes
,
of
whom
I
could
see
,
in
the
stained
glass
of
*NL*
the
apse
of
Saint-Hilaire
,
only
the
`
other
side
'
in
dull
black
lacquer
,
*NL*
if
I
raised
my
eyes
to
look
for
him
,
when
I
was
going
to
Camus
's
for
a
*NL*
packet
of
salt
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
it
happened
that
,
going
the
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
I
passed
*NL*
occasionally
by
a
row
of
well-watered
little
gardens
,
over
whose
hedges
*NL*
rose
clusters
of
dark
blossom
.
I
would
stop
before
them
,
hoping
to
gain
*NL*
some
precious
addition
to
my
experience
,
for
I
seemed
to
have
before
my
*NL*
eyes
a
fragment
of
that
riverside
country
which
I
had
longed
so
much
*NL*
to
see
and
know
since
coming
upon
a
description
of
it
by
one
of
my
*NL*
favourite
authors
.
And
it
was
with
that
story-book
land
,
with
its
*NL*
imagined
soil
intersected
by
a
hundred
bubbling
watercourses
,
that
*NL*
Guermantes
,
changing
its
form
in
my
mind
,
became
identified
,
after
I
*NL*
heard
Dr.
Percepied
speak
of
the
flowers
and
the
charming
rivulets
and
*NL*
fountains
that
were
to
be
seen
there
in
the
ducal
park
.
I
used
to
dream
*NL*
that
Mme.
de
Guermantes
,
taking
a
sudden
capricious
fancy
for
myself
,
*NL*
invited
me
there
,
that
all
day
long
she
stood
fishing
for
trout
by
my
*NL*
side
.
And
when
evening
came
,
holding
my
hand
in
her
own
,
as
we
passed
by
*NL*
the
little
gardens
of
her
vassals
,
she
would
point
out
to
me
the
flowers
*NL*
that
leaned
their
red
and
purple
spikes
along
the
tops
of
the
low
walls
,
*NL*
and
would
teach
me
all
their
names
.
She
would
make
me
tell
her
,
too
,
all
*NL*
about
the
poems
that
I
meant
to
compose
.
And
these
dreams
reminded
me
*NL*
that
,
since
I
wished
,
some
day
,
to
become
a
writer
,
it
was
high
time
to
*NL*
decide
what
sort
of
books
I
was
going
to
write
.
But
as
soon
as
I
asked
*NL*
myself
the
question
,
and
tried
to
discover
some
subjects
to
which
I
*NL*
could
impart
a
philosophical
significance
of
infinite
value
,
my
mind
*NL*
would
stop
like
a
clock
,
I
would
see
before
me
vacuity
,
nothing
,
would
*NL*
feel
either
that
I
was
wholly
devoid
of
talent
,
or
that
,
perhaps
,
a
*NL*
malady
of
the
brain
was
hindering
its
development
.
Sometimes
I
would
*NL*
depend
upon
my
father
's
arranging
everything
for
me
.
He
was
so
powerful
,
*NL*
in
such
favour
with
the
people
who
`
really
counted
,
'
that
he
made
it
*NL*
possible
for
us
to
transgress
laws
which
Françoise
had
taught
me
to
*NL*
regard
as
more
ineluctable
than
the
laws
of
life
and
death
,
as
when
we
*NL*
were
allowed
to
postpone
for
a
year
the
compulsory
repainting
of
the
*NL*
walls
of
our
house
,
alone
among
all
the
houses
in
that
part
of
Paris
,
*NL*
or
when
he
obtained
permission
from
the
Minister
for
Mme.
Sazerat
's
*NL*
son
,
who
had
been
ordered
to
some
watering-place
,
to
take
his
degree
two
*NL*
months
before
the
proper
time
,
among
the
candidates
whose
surnames
began
*NL*
with
`
A
,
'
instead
of
having
to
wait
his
turn
as
an
'S
.
'
If
I
had
fallen
*NL*
seriously
ill
,
if
I
had
been
captured
by
brigands
,
convinced
that
my
*NL*
father
's
understanding
with
the
supreme
powers
was
too
complete
,
that
*NL*
his
letters
of
introduction
to
the
Almighty
were
too
irresistible
for
my
*NL*
illness
or
captivity
to
turn
out
anything
but
vain
illusions
,
in
which
*NL*
there
was
no
danger
actually
threatening
me
,
I
should
have
awaited
*NL*
with
perfect
composure
the
inevitable
hour
of
my
return
to
comfortable
*NL*
realities
,
of
my
deliverance
from
bondage
or
restoration
to
health
.
*NL*
Perhaps
this
want
of
talent
,
this
black
cavity
which
gaped
in
my
mind
*NL*
when
I
ransacked
it
for
the
theme
of
my
future
writings
,
was
itself
no
*NL*
more
,
either
,
than
an
unsubstantial
illusion
,
and
would
be
brought
to
*NL*
an
end
by
the
intervention
of
my
father
,
who
would
arrange
with
the
*NL*
Government
and
with
Providence
that
I
should
be
the
first
writer
of
*NL*
my
day
.
But
at
other
times
,
while
my
parents
were
growing
impatient
*NL*
at
seeing
me
loiter
behind
instead
of
following
them
,
my
actual
life
,
*NL*
instead
of
seeming
an
artificial
creation
by
my
father
,
and
one
which
he
*NL*
could
modify
as
he
chose
,
appeared
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
be
comprised
in
*NL*
a
larger
reality
which
had
not
been
created
for
my
benefit
,
from
whose
*NL*
judgments
there
was
no
appeal
,
in
the
heart
of
which
I
was
bound
,
*NL*
helpless
,
without
friend
or
ally
,
and
beyond
which
no
further
*NL*
possibilities
lay
concealed
.
It
was
evident
to
me
then
that
I
existed
in
*NL*
the
same
manner
as
all
other
men
,
that
I
must
grow
old
,
that
I
must
die
*NL*
like
them
,
and
that
among
them
I
was
to
be
distinguished
merely
as
one
*NL*
of
those
who
have
no
aptitude
for
writing
.
And
so
,
utterly
despondent
,
I
*NL*
renounced
literature
for
ever
,
despite
the
encouragements
that
had
been
*NL*
given
me
by
Bloch
.
This
intimate
,
spontaneous
feeling
,
this
sense
of
the
*NL*
nullity
of
my
intellect
,
prevailed
against
all
the
flattering
speeches
*NL*
that
might
be
lavished
upon
me
,
as
a
wicked
man
,
when
everyone
is
loud
*NL*
in
the
praise
of
his
good
deeds
,
is
gnawed
by
the
secret
remorse
of
*NL*
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
my
mother
said
:
``
You
are
always
talking
about
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
.
Well
,
Dr.
Percepied
did
a
great
deal
for
her
when
she
was
*NL*
ill
,
four
years
ago
,
and
so
she
is
coming
to
Combray
for
his
daughter
's
*NL*
wedding
.
You
will
be
able
to
see
her
in
church
.
''
It
was
from
Dr.
*NL*
Percepied
,
as
it
happened
,
that
I
had
heard
most
about
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
,
and
he
had
even
shewn
us
the
number
of
an
illustrated
paper
*NL*
in
which
she
was
depicted
in
the
costume
which
she
had
worn
at
a
fancy
*NL*
dress
ball
given
by
the
Princesse
de
Léon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
during
the
nuptial
mass
,
the
beadle
,
by
moving
to
one
side
,
*NL*
enabled
me
to
see
,
sitting
in
a
chapel
,
a
lady
with
fair
hair
and
a
*NL*
large
nose
,
piercing
blue
eyes
,
a
billowy
scarf
of
mauve
silk
,
glossy
*NL*
and
new
and
brilliant
,
and
a
little
spot
at
the
corner
of
her
nose
.
And
*NL*
because
on
the
surface
of
her
face
,
which
was
red
,
as
though
she
had
*NL*
been
very
warm
,
I
could
make
out
,
diluted
and
barely
perceptible
,
*NL*
details
which
resembled
the
portrait
that
had
been
shewn
to
me
;
because
,
*NL*
more
especially
,
the
particular
features
which
I
remarked
in
this
lady
,
*NL*
if
I
attempted
to
catalogue
them
,
formulated
themselves
in
precisely
the
*NL*
same
terms
:
--
_
a
large
nose
,
blue
eyes
_
,
as
Dr.
Percepied
had
used
when
*NL*
describing
in
my
presence
the
Duchesse
de
Guermantes
,
I
said
to
myself
:
*NL*
``
This
lady
is
like
the
Duchesse
de
Guermantes
.
''
Now
the
chapel
from
*NL*
which
she
was
following
the
service
was
that
of
Gilbert
the
Bad
;
beneath
*NL*
its
flat
tombstones
,
yellowed
and
bulging
like
cells
of
honey
in
a
comb
,
*NL*
rested
the
bones
of
the
old
Counts
of
Brabant
;
and
I
remembered
having
*NL*
heard
it
said
that
this
chapel
was
reserved
for
the
Guermantes
family
,
*NL*
whenever
any
of
its
members
came
to
attend
a
ceremony
at
Combray
;
there
*NL*
was
,
indeed
,
but
one
woman
resembling
the
portrait
of
Mme.
de
Guermantes
*NL*
who
on
that
day
,
the
very
day
on
which
she
was
expected
to
come
there
,
*NL*
could
be
sitting
in
that
chapel
:
it
was
she
!
My
disappointment
was
*NL*
immense
.
It
arose
from
my
not
having
borne
in
mind
,
when
I
thought
of
*NL*
Mme.
de
Guermantes
,
that
I
was
picturing
her
to
myself
in
the
colours
of
*NL*
a
tapestry
or
a
painted
window
,
as
living
in
another
century
,
as
being
*NL*
of
another
substance
than
the
rest
of
the
human
race
.
Never
had
I
taken
*NL*
into
account
that
she
might
have
a
red
face
,
a
mauve
scarf
like
Mme.
*NL*
Sazerat
;
and
the
oval
curve
of
her
cheeks
reminded
me
so
strongly
of
*NL*
people
whom
I
had
seen
at
home
that
the
suspicion
brushed
against
my
*NL*
mind
-LRB-
though
it
was
immediately
banished
-RRB-
that
this
lady
in
her
creative
*NL*
principle
,
in
the
molecules
of
her
physical
composition
,
was
perhaps
*NL*
not
substantially
the
Duchesse
de
Guermantes
,
but
that
her
body
,
in
*NL*
ignorance
of
the
name
that
people
had
given
it
,
belonged
to
a
certain
*NL*
type
of
femininity
which
included
,
also
,
the
wives
of
doctors
and
*NL*
tradesmen
.
``
It
is
,
it
must
be
Mme.
de
Guermantes
,
and
no
one
else
!
''
were
*NL*
the
words
underlying
the
attentive
and
astonished
expression
with
*NL*
which
I
was
gazing
upon
this
image
,
which
,
naturally
enough
,
bore
no
*NL*
resemblance
to
those
that
had
so
often
,
under
the
same
title
of
`
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
,
'
appeared
to
me
in
dreams
,
since
this
one
had
not
been
,
like
*NL*
the
others
,
formed
arbitrarily
by
myself
,
but
had
sprung
into
sight
for
*NL*
the
first
time
,
only
a
moment
ago
,
here
in
church
;
an
image
which
was
*NL*
not
of
the
same
nature
,
was
not
colourable
at
will
,
like
those
others
*NL*
that
allowed
themselves
to
imbibe
the
orange
tint
of
a
sonorous
*NL*
syllable
,
but
which
was
so
real
that
everything
,
even
to
the
fiery
*NL*
little
spot
at
the
corner
of
her
nose
,
gave
an
assurance
of
her
*NL*
subjection
to
the
laws
of
life
,
as
in
a
transformation
scene
on
the
*NL*
stage
a
crease
in
the
dress
of
a
fairy
,
a
quivering
of
her
tiny
finger
,
*NL*
indicate
the
material
presence
of
a
living
actress
before
our
eyes
,
*NL*
whereas
we
were
uncertain
,
till
then
,
whether
we
were
not
looking
merely
*NL*
at
a
projection
of
limelight
from
a
lantern
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
I
was
endeavouring
to
apply
to
this
image
,
which
the
prominent
*NL*
nose
,
the
piercing
eyes
pinned
down
and
fixed
in
my
field
of
vision
*NL*
-LRB-
perhaps
because
it
was
they
that
had
first
struck
it
,
that
had
made
the
*NL*
first
impression
on
its
surface
,
before
I
had
had
time
to
wonder
*NL*
whether
the
woman
who
thus
appeared
before
me
might
possibly
be
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
-RRB-
,
to
this
fresh
and
unchanging
image
the
idea
:
``
It
is
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
''
;
but
I
succeeded
only
in
making
the
idea
pass
between
me
and
*NL*
the
image
,
as
though
they
were
two
discs
moving
in
separate
planes
,
*NL*
with
a
space
between
.
But
this
Mme.
de
Guermantes
of
whom
I
had
so
often
*NL*
dreamed
,
now
that
I
could
see
that
she
had
a
real
existence
independent
*NL*
of
myself
,
acquired
a
fresh
increase
of
power
over
my
imagination
,
*NL*
which
,
paralysed
for
a
moment
by
contact
with
a
reality
so
different
*NL*
from
anything
that
it
had
expected
,
began
to
react
and
to
say
within
me
:
*NL*
``
Great
and
glorious
before
the
days
of
Charlemagne
,
the
Guermantes
*NL*
had
the
right
of
life
and
death
over
their
vassals
;
the
Duchesse
de
*NL*
Guermantes
descends
from
Geneviève
de
Brabant
.
She
does
not
know
,
nor
*NL*
would
she
consent
to
know
,
any
of
the
people
who
are
here
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
--
oh
,
marvellous
independence
of
the
human
gaze
,
tied
to
the
*NL*
human
face
by
a
cord
so
loose
,
so
long
,
so
elastic
that
it
can
stray
,
*NL*
alone
,
as
far
as
it
may
choose
--
while
Mme.
de
Guermantes
sat
in
the
*NL*
chapel
above
the
tombs
of
her
dead
ancestors
,
her
gaze
lingered
here
*NL*
and
wandered
there
,
rose
to
the
capitals
of
the
pillars
,
and
even
rested
*NL*
upon
myself
,
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
straying
down
the
nave
,
but
a
ray
*NL*
of
sunlight
which
,
at
the
moment
when
I
received
its
caress
,
appeared
*NL*
conscious
of
where
it
fell
.
As
for
Mme.
de
Guermantes
herself
,
since
*NL*
she
remained
there
motionless
,
sitting
like
a
mother
who
affects
not
to
*NL*
notice
the
rude
or
awkward
conduct
of
her
children
who
,
in
the
course
*NL*
of
their
play
,
are
speaking
to
people
whom
she
does
not
know
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
me
to
determine
whether
she
approved
or
condemned
the
*NL*
vagrancy
of
her
eyes
in
the
careless
detachment
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
it
to
be
important
that
she
should
not
leave
the
church
before
*NL*
I
had
been
able
to
look
long
enough
upon
her
,
reminding
myself
that
for
*NL*
years
past
I
had
regarded
the
sight
of
her
as
a
thing
eminently
to
be
*NL*
desired
,
and
I
kept
my
eyes
fixed
on
her
,
as
though
by
gazing
at
her
*NL*
I
should
be
able
to
carry
away
and
incorporate
,
to
store
up
,
for
later
*NL*
reference
,
in
myself
the
memory
of
that
prominent
nose
,
those
red
*NL*
cheeks
,
of
all
those
details
which
struck
me
as
so
much
precious
,
*NL*
authentic
,
unparalleled
information
with
regard
to
her
face
.
And
now
*NL*
that
,
whenever
I
brought
my
mind
to
bear
upon
that
face
--
and
*NL*
especially
,
perhaps
,
in
my
determination
,
that
form
of
the
instinct
*NL*
of
self-preservation
with
which
we
guard
everything
that
is
best
in
*NL*
ourselves
,
not
to
admit
that
I
had
been
in
any
way
deceived
--
I
found
*NL*
only
beauty
there
;
setting
her
once
again
-LRB-
since
they
were
one
and
the
*NL*
same
person
,
this
lady
who
sat
before
me
and
that
Duchesse
de
Guermantes
*NL*
whom
,
until
then
,
I
had
been
used
to
conjure
into
an
imagined
shape
-RRB-
*NL*
apart
from
and
above
that
common
run
of
humanity
with
which
the
sight
,
*NL*
pure
and
simple
,
of
her
in
the
flesh
had
made
me
for
a
moment
confound
*NL*
her
,
I
grew
indignant
when
I
heard
people
saying
,
in
the
congregation
*NL*
round
me
:
``
She
is
better
looking
than
Mme.
Sazerat
''
or
``
than
Mlle.
*NL*
Vinteuil
,
''
as
though
she
had
been
in
any
way
comparable
with
them
.
And
*NL*
my
gaze
resting
upon
her
fair
hair
,
her
blue
eyes
,
the
lines
of
her
*NL*
neck
,
and
overlooking
the
features
which
might
have
reminded
me
of
*NL*
the
faces
of
other
women
,
I
cried
out
within
myself
,
as
I
admired
this
*NL*
deliberately
unfinished
sketch
:
``
How
lovely
she
is
!
What
true
nobility
!
*NL*
it
is
indeed
a
proud
Guermantes
,
the
descendant
of
Geneviève
de
Brabant
,
*NL*
that
I
have
before
me
!
''
And
the
care
which
I
took
to
focus
all
my
*NL*
attention
upon
her
face
succeeded
in
isolating
it
so
completely
that
*NL*
to-day
,
when
I
call
that
marriage
ceremony
to
mind
,
I
find
it
impossible
*NL*
to
visualise
any
single
person
who
was
present
except
her
,
and
the
*NL*
beadle
who
answered
me
in
the
affirmative
when
I
inquired
whether
the
*NL*
lady
was
,
indeed
,
Mme.
de
Guermantes
.
But
her
,
I
can
see
her
still
quite
*NL*
clearly
,
especially
at
the
moment
when
the
procession
filed
into
the
*NL*
sacristy
,
lighted
by
the
intermittent
,
hot
sunshine
of
a
windy
and
rainy
*NL*
day
,
where
Mme.
de
Guermantes
found
herself
in
the
midst
of
all
*NL*
those
Combray
people
whose
names
,
even
,
she
did
not
know
,
but
whose
*NL*
inferiority
proclaimed
her
own
supremacy
so
loud
that
she
must
,
in
*NL*
return
,
feel
for
them
a
genuine
,
pitying
sympathy
,
and
whom
she
might
*NL*
count
on
impressing
even
more
forcibly
by
virtue
of
her
simplicity
and
*NL*
natural
charm
.
And
then
,
too
,
since
she
could
not
bring
into
play
the
*NL*
deliberate
glances
,
charged
with
a
definite
meaning
,
which
one
directs
,
*NL*
in
a
crowd
,
towards
people
whom
one
knows
,
but
must
allow
her
vague
*NL*
thoughts
to
escape
continually
from
her
eyes
in
a
flood
of
blue
light
*NL*
which
she
was
powerless
to
control
,
she
was
anxious
not
to
distress
in
*NL*
any
way
,
not
to
seem
to
be
despising
those
humbler
mortals
over
whom
*NL*
that
current
flowed
,
by
whom
it
was
everywhere
arrested
.
I
can
see
*NL*
again
to-day
,
above
her
mauve
scarf
,
silky
and
buoyant
,
the
gentle
*NL*
astonishment
in
her
eyes
,
to
which
she
had
added
,
without
daring
to
*NL*
address
it
to
anyone
in
particular
,
but
so
that
everyone
might
enjoy
his
*NL*
share
of
it
,
the
almost
timid
smile
of
a
sovereign
lady
who
seems
to
*NL*
be
making
an
apology
for
her
presence
among
the
vassals
whom
she
loves
.
*NL*
This
smile
rested
upon
myself
,
who
had
never
ceased
to
follow
her
with
*NL*
my
eyes
.
And
I
,
remembering
the
glance
which
she
had
let
fall
upon
me
*NL*
during
the
service
,
blue
as
a
ray
of
sunlight
that
had
penetrated
the
*NL*
window
of
Gilbert
the
Bad
,
said
to
myself
,
``
Of
course
,
she
is
thinking
*NL*
about
me
.
''
I
fancied
that
I
had
found
favour
in
her
sight
,
that
she
*NL*
would
continue
to
think
of
me
after
she
had
left
the
church
,
and
would
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
grow
pensive
again
,
that
evening
,
at
Guermantes
,
on
my
account
.
*NL*
And
at
once
I
fell
in
love
with
her
,
for
if
it
is
sometimes
enough
to
*NL*
make
us
love
a
woman
that
she
looks
on
us
with
contempt
,
as
I
supposed
*NL*
Mlle.
Swann
to
have
done
,
while
we
imagine
that
she
can
not
ever
be
ours
,
*NL*
it
is
enough
,
also
,
sometimes
that
she
looks
on
us
kindly
,
as
Mme.
de
*NL*
Guermantes
did
then
,
while
we
think
of
her
as
almost
ours
already
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
waxed
blue
as
a
periwinkle
flower
,
wholly
beyond
my
reach
,
yet
*NL*
dedicated
by
her
to
me
;
and
the
sun
,
bursting
out
again
from
behind
*NL*
a
threatening
cloud
and
darting
the
full
force
of
its
rays
on
to
the
*NL*
Square
and
into
the
sacristy
,
shed
a
geranium
glow
over
the
red
carpet
*NL*
laid
down
for
the
wedding
,
along
which
Mme.
de
Guermantes
smilingly
*NL*
advanced
,
and
covered
its
woollen
texture
with
a
nap
of
rosy
velvet
,
a
*NL*
bloom
of
light
,
giving
it
that
sort
of
tenderness
,
of
solemn
sweetness
*NL*
in
the
pomp
of
a
joyful
celebration
,
which
characterises
certain
pages
*NL*
of
_
Lohengrin
_
,
certain
paintings
by
Carpaccio
,
and
makes
us
understand
*NL*
how
Baudelaire
was
able
to
apply
to
the
sound
of
the
trumpet
the
epithet
*NL*
`
delicious
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
How
often
,
after
that
day
,
in
the
course
of
my
walks
along
the
*NL*
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
and
with
what
an
intensified
melancholy
did
I
reflect
*NL*
on
my
lack
of
qualification
for
a
literary
career
,
and
that
I
must
*NL*
abandon
all
hope
of
ever
becoming
a
famous
author
.
The
regret
that
I
*NL*
felt
for
this
,
while
I
lingered
alone
to
dream
for
a
little
by
myself
,
*NL*
made
me
suffer
so
acutely
that
,
in
order
not
to
feel
it
,
my
mind
of
*NL*
its
own
accord
,
by
a
sort
of
inhibition
in
the
instant
of
pain
,
ceased
*NL*
entirely
to
think
of
verse-making
,
of
fiction
,
of
the
poetic
future
on
*NL*
which
my
want
of
talent
precluded
me
from
counting
.
Then
,
quite
apart
*NL*
from
all
those
literary
preoccupations
,
and
without
definite
attachment
*NL*
to
anything
,
suddenly
a
roof
,
a
gleam
of
sunlight
reflected
from
a
*NL*
stone
,
the
smell
of
a
road
would
make
me
stop
still
,
to
enjoy
the
*NL*
special
pleasure
that
each
of
them
gave
me
,
and
also
because
they
*NL*
appeared
to
be
concealing
,
beneath
what
my
eyes
could
see
,
something
*NL*
which
they
invited
me
to
approach
and
seize
from
them
,
but
which
,
*NL*
despite
all
my
efforts
,
I
never
managed
to
discover
.
As
I
felt
that
the
*NL*
mysterious
object
was
to
be
found
in
them
,
I
would
stand
there
in
front
*NL*
of
them
,
motionless
,
gazing
,
breathing
,
endeavouring
to
penetrate
with
*NL*
my
mind
beyond
the
thing
seen
or
smelt
.
And
if
I
had
then
to
hasten
*NL*
after
my
grandfather
,
to
proceed
on
my
way
,
I
would
still
seek
to
*NL*
recover
my
sense
of
them
by
closing
my
eyes
;
I
would
concentrate
upon
*NL*
recalling
exactly
the
line
of
the
roof
,
the
colour
of
the
stone
,
which
,
*NL*
without
my
being
able
to
understand
why
,
had
seemed
to
me
to
be
teeming
,
*NL*
ready
to
open
,
to
yield
up
to
me
the
secret
treasure
of
which
they
were
*NL*
themselves
no
more
than
the
outer
coverings
.
It
was
certainly
not
any
*NL*
impression
of
this
kind
that
could
or
would
restore
the
hope
I
had
lost
*NL*
of
succeeding
one
day
in
becoming
an
author
and
poet
,
for
each
of
them
*NL*
was
associated
with
some
material
object
devoid
of
any
intellectual
*NL*
value
,
and
suggesting
no
abstract
truth
.
But
at
least
they
gave
me
an
*NL*
unreasoning
pleasure
,
the
illusion
of
a
sort
of
fecundity
of
mind
;
and
*NL*
in
that
way
distracted
me
from
the
tedium
,
from
the
sense
of
my
own
*NL*
impotence
which
I
had
felt
whenever
I
had
sought
a
philosophic
theme
*NL*
for
some
great
literary
work
.
So
urgent
was
the
task
imposed
on
my
*NL*
conscience
by
these
impressions
of
form
or
perfume
or
colour
--
to
strive
*NL*
for
a
perception
of
what
lay
hidden
beneath
them
,
that
I
was
never
*NL*
long
in
seeking
an
excuse
which
would
allow
me
to
relax
so
strenuous
an
*NL*
effort
and
to
spare
myself
the
fatigue
that
it
involved
.
As
good
luck
*NL*
would
have
it
,
my
parents
called
me
;
I
felt
that
I
had
not
,
for
the
*NL*
moment
,
the
calm
environment
necessary
for
a
successful
pursuit
of
my
*NL*
researches
,
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
think
no
more
of
the
matter
*NL*
until
I
reached
home
,
and
not
to
exhaust
myself
in
the
meantime
to
no
*NL*
purpose
.
And
so
I
concerned
myself
no
longer
with
the
mystery
that
lay
*NL*
hidden
in
a
form
or
a
perfume
,
quite
at
ease
in
my
mind
,
since
I
was
*NL*
taking
it
home
with
me
,
protected
by
its
visible
and
tangible
covering
,
*NL*
beneath
which
I
should
find
it
still
alive
,
like
the
fish
which
,
on
days
*NL*
when
I
had
been
allowed
to
go
out
fishing
,
I
used
to
carry
back
in
my
*NL*
basket
,
buried
in
a
couch
of
grass
which
kept
them
cool
and
fresh
.
Once
*NL*
in
the
house
again
I
would
begin
to
think
of
something
else
,
and
so
my
*NL*
mind
would
become
littered
-LRB-
as
my
room
was
with
the
flowers
that
I
had
*NL*
gathered
on
my
walks
,
or
the
odds
and
ends
that
people
had
given
me
-RRB-
*NL*
with
a
stone
from
the
surface
of
which
the
sunlight
was
reflected
,
a
*NL*
roof
,
the
sound
of
a
bell
,
the
smell
of
fallen
leaves
,
a
confused
mass
*NL*
of
different
images
,
under
which
must
have
perished
long
ago
the
reality
*NL*
of
which
I
used
to
have
some
foreboding
,
but
which
I
never
had
the
*NL*
energy
to
discover
and
bring
to
light
.
Once
,
however
,
when
we
had
*NL*
prolonged
our
walk
far
beyond
its
ordinary
limits
,
and
so
had
been
very
*NL*
glad
to
encounter
,
half
way
home
,
as
afternoon
darkened
into
evening
,
*NL*
Dr.
Percepied
,
who
drove
past
us
at
full
speed
in
his
carriage
,
saw
and
*NL*
recognised
us
,
stopped
,
and
made
us
jump
in
beside
him
,
I
received
an
*NL*
impression
of
this
sort
which
I
did
not
abandon
without
having
first
*NL*
subjected
it
to
an
examination
a
little
more
thorough
.
I
had
been
set
*NL*
on
the
box
beside
the
coachman
,
we
were
going
like
the
wind
because
*NL*
the
Doctor
had
still
,
before
returning
to
Combray
,
to
call
at
*NL*
Martinville-le-Sec
,
at
the
house
of
a
patient
,
at
whose
door
he
asked
*NL*
us
to
wait
for
him
.
At
a
bend
in
the
road
I
experienced
,
suddenly
,
that
*NL*
special
pleasure
,
which
bore
no
resemblance
to
any
other
,
when
I
caught
*NL*
sight
of
the
twin
steeples
of
Martinville
,
on
which
the
setting
sun
was
*NL*
playing
,
while
the
movement
of
the
carriage
and
the
windings
of
the
road
*NL*
seemed
to
keep
them
continually
changing
their
position
;
and
then
of
a
*NL*
third
steeple
,
that
of
Vieuxvicq
,
which
,
although
separated
from
them
*NL*
by
a
hill
and
a
valley
,
and
rising
from
rather
higher
ground
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
appeared
none
the
less
to
be
standing
by
their
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
ascertaining
and
noting
the
shape
of
their
spires
,
the
changes
*NL*
of
aspect
,
the
sunny
warmth
of
their
surfaces
,
I
felt
that
I
was
not
*NL*
penetrating
to
the
full
depth
of
my
impression
,
that
something
more
lay
*NL*
behind
that
mobility
,
that
luminosity
,
something
which
they
seemed
at
*NL*
once
to
contain
and
to
conceal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
steeples
appeared
so
distant
,
and
we
ourselves
seemed
to
come
so
*NL*
little
nearer
them
,
that
I
was
astonished
when
,
a
few
minutes
later
,
we
*NL*
drew
up
outside
the
church
of
Martinville
.
I
did
not
know
the
reason
for
*NL*
the
pleasure
which
I
had
found
in
seeing
them
upon
the
horizon
,
and
*NL*
the
business
of
trying
to
find
out
what
that
reason
was
seemed
to
me
*NL*
irksome
;
I
wished
only
to
keep
in
reserve
in
my
brain
those
converging
*NL*
lines
,
moving
in
the
sunshine
,
and
,
for
the
time
being
,
to
think
of
*NL*
them
no
more
.
And
it
is
probable
that
,
had
I
done
so
,
those
two
steeples
*NL*
would
have
vanished
for
ever
,
in
a
great
medley
of
trees
and
roofs
and
*NL*
scents
and
sounds
which
I
had
noticed
and
set
apart
on
account
of
the
*NL*
obscure
sense
of
pleasure
which
they
gave
me
,
but
without
ever
exploring
*NL*
them
more
fully
.
I
got
down
from
the
box
to
talk
to
my
parents
while
we
*NL*
were
waiting
for
the
Doctor
to
reappear
.
Then
it
was
time
to
start
;
I
*NL*
climbed
up
again
to
my
place
,
turning
my
head
to
look
back
,
once
more
,
*NL*
at
my
steeples
,
of
which
,
a
little
later
,
I
caught
a
farewell
glimpse
*NL*
at
a
turn
in
the
road
.
The
coachman
,
who
seemed
little
inclined
for
*NL*
conversation
,
having
barely
acknowledged
my
remarks
,
I
was
obliged
,
*NL*
in
default
of
other
society
,
to
fall
back
on
my
own
,
and
to
attempt
to
*NL*
recapture
the
vision
of
my
steeples
.
And
presently
their
outlines
and
*NL*
their
sunlit
surface
,
as
though
they
had
been
a
sort
of
rind
,
were
*NL*
stripped
apart
;
a
little
of
what
they
had
concealed
from
me
became
*NL*
apparent
;
an
idea
came
into
my
mind
which
had
not
existed
for
me
a
*NL*
moment
earlier
,
framed
itself
in
words
in
my
head
;
and
the
pleasure
*NL*
with
which
the
first
sight
of
them
,
just
now
,
had
filled
me
was
so
much
*NL*
enhanced
that
,
overpowered
by
a
sort
of
intoxication
,
I
could
no
longer
*NL*
think
of
anything
but
them
.
At
this
point
,
although
we
had
now
travelled
*NL*
a
long
way
from
Martinville
,
I
turned
my
head
and
caught
sight
of
them
*NL*
again
,
quite
black
this
time
,
for
the
sun
had
meanwhile
set
.
Every
few
*NL*
minutes
a
turn
in
the
road
would
sweep
them
out
of
sight
;
then
they
*NL*
shewed
themselves
for
the
last
time
,
and
so
I
saw
them
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
admitting
to
myself
that
what
lay
buried
within
the
steeples
of
*NL*
Martinville
must
be
something
analogous
to
a
charming
phrase
,
since
it
*NL*
was
in
the
form
of
words
which
gave
me
pleasure
that
it
had
appeared
to
*NL*
me
,
I
borrowed
a
pencil
and
some
paper
from
the
Doctor
,
and
composed
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
jolting
of
the
carriage
,
to
appease
my
conscience
and
to
*NL*
satisfy
my
enthusiasm
,
the
following
little
fragment
,
which
I
have
since
*NL*
discovered
,
and
now
reproduce
,
with
only
a
slight
revision
here
and
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alone
,
rising
from
the
level
of
the
plain
,
and
seemingly
lost
in
*NL*
that
expanse
of
open
country
,
climbed
to
the
sky
the
twin
steeples
of
*NL*
Martinville
.
Presently
we
saw
three
:
springing
into
position
confronting
*NL*
them
by
a
daring
volt
,
a
third
,
a
dilatory
steeple
,
that
of
Vieuxvicq
,
*NL*
was
come
to
join
them
.
The
minutes
passed
,
we
were
moving
rapidly
,
and
*NL*
yet
the
three
steeples
were
always
a
long
way
ahead
of
us
,
like
*NL*
three
birds
perched
upon
the
plain
,
motionless
and
conspicuous
in
*NL*
the
sunlight
.
Then
the
steeple
of
Vieuxvicq
withdrew
,
took
its
proper
*NL*
distance
,
and
the
steeples
of
Martinville
remained
alone
,
gilded
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
setting
sun
,
which
,
even
at
that
distance
,
I
could
*NL*
see
playing
and
smiling
upon
their
sloped
sides
.
We
had
been
so
long
in
*NL*
approaching
them
that
I
was
thinking
of
the
time
that
must
still
elapse
*NL*
before
we
could
reach
them
when
,
of
a
sudden
,
the
carriage
,
having
*NL*
turned
a
corner
,
set
us
down
at
their
feet
;
and
they
had
flung
*NL*
themselves
so
abruptly
in
our
path
that
we
had
barely
time
to
stop
*NL*
before
being
dashed
against
the
porch
of
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
resumed
our
course
;
we
had
left
Martinville
some
little
time
,
and
*NL*
the
village
,
after
accompanying
us
for
a
few
seconds
,
had
already
*NL*
disappeared
,
when
,
lingering
alone
on
the
horizon
to
watch
our
flight
,
*NL*
its
steeples
and
that
of
Vieuxvicq
waved
once
again
,
in
token
of
*NL*
farewell
,
their
sun-bathed
pinnacles
.
Sometimes
one
would
withdraw
,
*NL*
so
that
the
other
two
might
watch
us
for
a
moment
still
;
then
the
road
*NL*
changed
direction
,
they
veered
in
the
light
like
three
golden
pivots
,
*NL*
and
vanished
from
my
gaze
.
But
,
a
little
later
,
when
we
were
already
*NL*
close
to
Combray
,
the
sun
having
set
meanwhile
,
I
caught
sight
of
them
*NL*
for
the
last
time
,
far
away
,
and
seeming
no
more
now
than
three
flowers
*NL*
painted
upon
the
sky
above
the
low
line
of
fields
.
They
made
me
think
,
*NL*
too
,
of
three
maidens
in
a
legend
,
abandoned
in
a
solitary
place
over
*NL*
which
night
had
begun
to
fall
;
and
while
we
drew
away
from
them
at
a
*NL*
gallop
,
I
could
see
them
timidly
seeking
their
way
,
and
,
after
some
*NL*
awkward
,
stumbling
movements
of
their
noble
silhouettes
,
drawing
close
*NL*
to
one
another
,
slipping
one
behind
another
,
shewing
nothing
more
,
*NL*
now
,
against
the
still
rosy
sky
than
a
single
dusky
form
,
charming
and
*NL*
resigned
,
and
so
vanishing
in
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
thought
again
of
this
page
,
but
at
the
moment
when
,
on
my
*NL*
corner
of
the
box-seat
,
where
the
Doctor
's
coachman
was
in
the
habit
*NL*
of
placing
,
in
a
hamper
,
the
fowls
which
he
had
bought
at
Martinville
*NL*
market
,
I
had
finished
writing
it
,
I
found
such
a
sense
of
happiness
,
*NL*
felt
that
it
had
so
entirely
relieved
my
mind
of
the
obsession
of
the
*NL*
steeples
,
and
of
the
mystery
which
they
concealed
,
that
,
as
though
I
*NL*
myself
were
a
hen
and
had
just
laid
an
egg
,
I
began
to
sing
at
the
top
*NL*
of
my
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
long
,
during
these
walks
,
I
had
been
able
to
muse
upon
the
*NL*
pleasure
that
there
would
be
in
the
friendship
of
the
Duchesse
de
*NL*
Guermantes
,
in
fishing
for
trout
,
in
drifting
by
myself
in
a
boat
on
the
*NL*
Vivonne
;
and
,
greedy
for
happiness
,
I
asked
nothing
more
from
life
,
in
*NL*
such
moments
,
than
that
it
should
consist
always
of
a
series
of
joyous
*NL*
afternoons
.
But
when
,
on
our
way
home
,
I
had
caught
sight
of
a
farm
,
on
*NL*
the
left
of
the
road
,
at
some
distance
from
two
other
farms
which
were
*NL*
themselves
close
together
,
and
from
which
,
to
return
to
Combray
,
we
need
*NL*
only
turn
down
an
avenue
of
oaks
,
bordered
on
one
side
by
a
series
of
*NL*
orchard-closes
,
each
one
planted
at
regular
intervals
with
apple-trees
*NL*
which
cast
upon
the
ground
,
when
they
were
lighted
by
the
setting
sun
,
*NL*
the
Japanese
stencil
of
their
shadows
;
then
,
sharply
,
my
heart
would
*NL*
begin
to
beat
,
I
would
know
that
in
half
an
hour
we
should
be
at
*NL*
home
,
and
that
there
,
as
was
the
rule
on
days
when
we
had
taken
the
*NL*
`
Guermantes
way
'
and
dinner
was
,
in
consequence
,
served
later
than
*NL*
usual
,
I
should
be
sent
to
bed
as
soon
as
I
had
swallowed
my
soup
,
so
*NL*
that
my
mother
,
kept
at
table
,
just
as
though
there
had
been
company
to
*NL*
dinner
,
would
not
come
upstairs
to
say
good
night
to
me
in
bed
.
The
zone
*NL*
of
melancholy
which
I
then
entered
was
totally
distinct
from
that
other
*NL*
zone
,
in
which
I
had
been
bounding
for
joy
a
moment
earlier
,
just
as
*NL*
sometimes
in
the
sky
a
band
of
pink
is
separated
,
as
though
by
a
line
*NL*
invisibly
ruled
,
from
a
band
of
green
or
black
.
You
may
see
a
bird
*NL*
flying
across
the
pink
;
it
draws
near
the
border-line
,
touches
it
,
*NL*
enters
and
is
lost
upon
the
black
.
The
longings
by
which
I
had
just
*NL*
now
been
absorbed
,
to
go
to
Guermantes
,
to
travel
,
to
live
a
life
of
*NL*
happiness
--
I
was
now
so
remote
from
them
that
their
fulfilment
would
*NL*
have
afforded
me
no
pleasure
.
How
readily
would
I
have
sacrificed
them
*NL*
all
,
just
to
be
able
to
cry
,
all
night
long
,
in
the
arms
of
Mamma
!
*NL*
Shuddering
with
emotion
,
I
could
not
take
my
agonised
eyes
from
my
*NL*
mother
's
face
,
which
was
not
to
appear
that
evening
in
the
bedroom
where
*NL*
I
could
see
myself
already
lying
,
in
imagination
;
and
wished
only
that
*NL*
I
were
lying
dead
.
And
this
state
would
persist
until
the
morrow
,
when
,
*NL*
the
rays
of
morning
leaning
their
bars
of
light
,
as
the
gardener
might
*NL*
lean
his
ladder
,
against
the
wall
overgrown
with
nasturtiums
,
which
*NL*
clambered
up
it
as
far
as
my
window-sill
,
I
would
leap
out
of
bed
to
run
*NL*
down
at
once
into
the
garden
,
with
no
thought
of
the
fact
that
evening
*NL*
must
return
,
and
with
it
the
hour
when
I
must
leave
my
mother
.
And
so
*NL*
it
was
from
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
that
I
learned
to
distinguish
between
*NL*
these
states
which
reigned
alternately
in
my
mind
,
during
certain
*NL*
periods
,
going
so
far
as
to
divide
every
day
between
them
,
each
one
*NL*
returning
to
dispossess
the
other
with
the
regularity
of
a
fever
and
*NL*
ague
:
contiguous
,
and
yet
so
foreign
to
one
another
,
so
devoid
of
means
*NL*
of
communication
,
that
I
could
no
longer
understand
,
or
even
picture
to
*NL*
myself
,
in
one
state
what
I
had
desired
or
dreaded
or
even
done
in
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
'M
éséglise
way
'
and
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
remain
for
me
linked
*NL*
with
many
of
the
little
incidents
of
that
one
of
all
the
divers
lives
*NL*
along
whose
parallel
lines
we
are
moved
,
which
is
the
most
abundant
in
*NL*
sudden
reverses
of
fortune
,
the
richest
in
episodes
;
I
mean
the
life
of
*NL*
the
mind
.
Doubtless
it
makes
in
us
an
imperceptible
progress
,
and
the
*NL*
truths
which
have
changed
for
us
its
meaning
and
its
aspect
,
which
have
*NL*
opened
new
paths
before
our
feet
,
we
had
for
long
been
preparing
for
*NL*
their
discovery
;
but
that
preparation
was
unconscious
;
and
for
us
*NL*
those
truths
date
only
from
the
day
,
from
the
minute
when
they
became
*NL*
apparent
.
The
flowers
which
played
then
among
the
grass
,
the
water
*NL*
which
rippled
past
in
the
sunshine
,
the
whole
landscape
which
served
as
*NL*
environment
to
their
apparition
lingers
around
the
memory
of
them
still
*NL*
with
its
unconscious
or
unheeding
air
;
and
,
certainly
,
when
they
were
*NL*
slowly
scrutinised
by
this
humble
passer-by
,
by
this
dreaming
*NL*
child
--
as
the
face
of
a
king
is
scrutinised
by
a
petitioner
lost
in
the
*NL*
crowd
--
that
scrap
of
nature
,
that
corner
of
a
garden
could
never
suppose
*NL*
that
it
would
be
thanks
to
him
that
they
would
be
elected
to
survive
in
*NL*
all
their
most
ephemeral
details
;
and
yet
the
scent
of
hawthorn
which
*NL*
strays
plundering
along
the
hedge
from
which
,
in
a
little
while
,
the
*NL*
dog-roses
will
have
banished
it
,
a
sound
of
footsteps
followed
by
no
*NL*
echo
,
upon
a
gravel
path
,
a
bubble
formed
at
the
side
of
a
waterplant
by
*NL*
the
current
,
and
formed
only
to
burst
--
my
exaltation
of
mind
has
borne
*NL*
them
with
it
,
and
has
succeeded
in
making
them
traverse
all
these
*NL*
successive
years
,
while
all
around
them
the
one-trodden
ways
have
*NL*
vanished
,
while
those
who
thronged
those
ways
,
and
even
the
memory
of
*NL*
those
who
thronged
those
trodden
ways
,
are
dead
.
Sometimes
the
fragment
*NL*
of
landscape
thus
transported
into
the
present
will
detach
itself
in
*NL*
such
isolation
from
all
associations
that
it
floats
uncertainly
upon
my
*NL*
mind
,
like
a
flowering
isle
of
Delos
,
and
I
am
unable
to
say
from
*NL*
what
place
,
from
what
time
--
perhaps
,
quite
simply
,
from
which
of
my
*NL*
dreams
--
it
comes
.
But
it
is
pre-eminently
as
the
deepest
layer
of
my
*NL*
mental
soil
,
as
firm
sites
on
which
I
still
may
build
,
that
I
regard
*NL*
the
Méséglise
and
Guermantes
`
ways
.
'
It
is
because
I
used
to
think
of
*NL*
certain
things
,
of
certain
people
,
while
I
was
roaming
along
them
,
that
*NL*
the
things
,
the
people
which
they
taught
me
to
know
,
and
these
alone
,
*NL*
I
still
take
seriously
,
still
give
me
joy
.
Whether
it
be
that
the
faith
*NL*
which
creates
has
ceased
to
exist
in
me
,
or
that
reality
will
take
shape
*NL*
in
the
memory
alone
,
the
flowers
that
people
shew
me
nowadays
for
the
*NL*
first
time
never
seem
to
me
to
be
true
flowers
.
The
'M
éséglise
way
'
*NL*
with
its
lilacs
,
its
hawthorns
,
its
cornflowers
,
its
poppies
,
its
*NL*
apple-trees
,
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
with
its
river
full
of
tadpoles
,
its
*NL*
water-lilies
,
and
its
buttercups
have
constituted
for
me
for
all
time
*NL*
the
picture
of
the
land
in
which
I
fain
would
pass
my
life
,
in
which
my
*NL*
only
requirements
are
that
I
may
go
out
fishing
,
drift
idly
in
a
boat
,
*NL*
see
the
ruins
of
a
gothic
fortress
in
the
grass
,
and
find
hidden
among
*NL*
the
cornfields
--
as
Saint-André-des-Champs
lay
hidden
--
an
old
church
,
*NL*
monumental
,
rustic
,
and
yellow
like
a
mill-stone
;
and
the
cornflowers
,
*NL*
the
hawthorns
,
the
apple-trees
which
I
may
happen
,
when
I
go
walking
,
to
*NL*
encounter
in
the
fields
,
because
they
are
situated
at
the
same
depth
,
on
*NL*
the
level
of
my
past
life
,
at
once
establish
contact
with
my
heart
.
And
*NL*
yet
,
because
there
is
an
element
of
individuality
in
places
,
when
I
am
*NL*
seized
with
a
desire
to
see
again
the
`
Guermantes
way
,
'
it
would
not
*NL*
be
satisfied
were
I
led
to
the
banks
of
a
river
in
which
were
lilies
*NL*
as
fair
,
or
even
fairer
than
those
in
the
Vivonne
,
any
more
than
on
my
*NL*
return
home
in
the
evening
,
at
the
hour
when
there
awakened
in
me
that
*NL*
anguish
which
,
later
on
in
life
,
transfers
itself
to
the
passion
of
*NL*
love
,
and
may
even
become
its
inseparable
companion
,
I
should
have
*NL*
wished
for
any
strange
mother
to
come
in
and
say
good
night
to
me
,
*NL*
though
she
were
far
more
beautiful
and
more
intelligent
than
my
own
.
No
:
*NL*
just
as
the
one
thing
necessary
to
send
me
to
sleep
contented
-LRB-
in
that
*NL*
untroubled
peace
which
no
mistress
,
in
later
years
,
has
ever
been
able
*NL*
to
give
me
,
since
one
has
doubts
of
them
at
the
moment
when
one
believes
*NL*
in
them
,
and
never
can
possess
their
hearts
as
I
used
to
receive
,
in
her
*NL*
kiss
,
the
heart
of
my
mother
,
complete
,
without
scruple
or
reservation
,
*NL*
unburdened
by
any
liability
save
to
myself
-RRB-
was
that
it
should
be
my
*NL*
mother
who
came
,
that
she
should
incline
towards
me
that
face
on
which
*NL*
there
was
,
beneath
her
eye
,
something
that
was
,
it
appears
,
a
blemish
,
*NL*
and
which
I
loved
as
much
as
all
the
rest
--
so
what
I
want
to
see
again
*NL*
is
the
`
Guermantes
way
'
as
I
knew
it
,
with
the
farm
that
stood
a
little
*NL*
apart
from
the
two
neighbouring
farms
,
pressed
so
close
together
,
at
the
*NL*
entrance
to
the
oak
avenue
;
those
meadows
upon
whose
surface
,
when
it
*NL*
is
polished
by
the
sun
to
the
mirroring
radiance
of
a
lake
,
are
outlined
*NL*
the
leaves
of
the
apple-trees
;
that
whole
landscape
whose
individuality
*NL*
sometimes
,
at
night
,
in
my
dreams
,
binds
me
with
a
power
that
is
almost
*NL*
fantastic
,
of
which
I
can
discover
no
trace
when
I
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
,
by
virtue
of
having
permanently
and
indissolubly
combined
in
*NL*
me
groups
of
different
impressions
,
for
no
reason
save
that
they
had
*NL*
made
me
feel
several
separate
things
at
the
same
time
,
the
Méséglise
*NL*
and
Guermantes
`
ways
'
left
me
exposed
,
in
later
life
,
to
much
*NL*
disillusionment
,
and
even
to
many
mistakes
.
For
often
I
have
wished
to
*NL*
see
a
person
again
without
realising
that
it
was
simply
because
that
*NL*
person
recalled
to
me
a
hedge
of
hawthorns
in
blossom
;
and
I
have
been
*NL*
led
to
believe
,
and
to
make
some
one
else
believe
in
an
aftermath
of
*NL*
affection
,
by
what
was
no
more
than
an
inclination
to
travel
.
But
by
*NL*
the
same
qualities
,
and
by
their
persistence
in
those
of
my
impressions
,
*NL*
to-day
,
to
which
they
can
find
an
attachment
,
the
two
`
ways
'
give
to
*NL*
those
impressions
a
foundation
,
depth
,
a
dimension
lacking
from
the
*NL*
rest
.
They
invest
them
,
too
,
with
a
charm
,
a
significance
which
is
for
*NL*
me
alone
.
When
,
on
a
summer
evening
,
the
resounding
sky
growls
like
a
*NL*
tawny
lion
,
and
everyone
is
complaining
of
the
storm
,
it
is
along
the
*NL*
'M
éséglise
way
'
that
my
fancy
strays
alone
in
ecstasy
,
inhaling
,
*NL*
through
the
noise
of
falling
rain
,
the
odour
of
invisible
and
persistent
*NL*
lilac-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
I
would
often
lie
until
morning
,
dreaming
of
the
old
days
at
*NL*
Combray
,
of
my
melancholy
and
wakeful
evenings
there
;
of
other
days
*NL*
besides
,
the
memory
of
which
had
been
more
lately
restored
to
me
by
the
*NL*
taste
--
by
what
would
have
been
called
at
Combray
the
`
perfume
'
--
of
a
*NL*
cup
of
tea
;
and
,
by
an
association
of
memories
,
of
a
story
which
,
many
*NL*
years
after
I
had
left
the
little
place
,
had
been
told
me
of
a
love
*NL*
affair
in
which
Swann
had
been
involved
before
I
was
born
;
with
that
*NL*
accuracy
of
detail
which
it
is
easier
,
often
,
to
obtain
when
we
are
*NL*
studying
the
lives
of
people
who
have
been
dead
for
centuries
than
when
*NL*
we
are
trying
to
chronicle
those
of
our
own
most
intimate
friends
,
an
*NL*
accuracy
which
it
seems
as
impossible
to
attain
as
it
seemed
impossible
*NL*
to
speak
from
one
town
to
another
,
before
we
learned
of
the
contrivance
*NL*
by
which
that
impossibility
has
been
overcome
.
All
these
memories
,
*NL*
following
one
after
another
,
were
condensed
into
a
single
substance
,
*NL*
but
had
not
so
far
coalesced
that
I
could
not
discern
between
the
*NL*
three
strata
,
between
my
oldest
,
my
instinctive
memories
,
those
others
,
*NL*
inspired
more
recently
by
a
taste
or
`
perfume
,
'
and
those
which
were
*NL*
actually
the
memories
of
another
,
from
whom
I
had
acquired
them
at
*NL*
second
hand
--
no
fissures
,
indeed
,
no
geological
faults
,
but
at
least
*NL*
those
veins
,
those
streaks
of
colour
which
in
certain
rocks
,
in
certain
*NL*
marbles
,
point
to
differences
of
origin
,
age
,
and
formation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
,
when
morning
drew
near
,
I
would
long
have
settled
the
*NL*
brief
uncertainty
of
my
waking
dream
,
I
would
know
in
what
room
I
*NL*
was
actually
lying
,
would
have
reconstructed
it
round
about
me
in
*NL*
the
darkness
,
and
--
fixing
my
orientation
by
memory
alone
,
or
with
the
*NL*
assistance
of
a
feeble
glimmer
of
light
at
the
foot
of
which
I
placed
*NL*
the
curtains
and
the
window
--
would
have
reconstructed
it
complete
and
*NL*
with
its
furniture
,
as
an
architect
and
an
upholsterer
might
do
,
working
*NL*
upon
an
original
,
discarded
plan
of
the
doors
and
windows
;
would
have
*NL*
replaced
the
mirrors
and
set
the
chest-of-drawers
on
its
accustomed
*NL*
site
.
`
But
scarcely
had
daylight
itself
--
and
no
longer
the
gleam
from
*NL*
a
last
,
dying
ember
on
a
brass
curtain-rod
,
which
I
had
mistaken
for
*NL*
daylight
--
traced
across
the
darkness
,
as
with
a
stroke
of
chalk
across
*NL*
a
blackboard
,
its
first
white
correcting
ray
,
when
the
window
,
with
*NL*
its
curtains
,
would
leave
the
frame
of
the
doorway
,
in
which
I
had
*NL*
erroneously
placed
it
,
while
,
to
make
room
for
it
,
the
writing-table
,
*NL*
which
my
memory
had
clumsily
fixed
where
the
window
ought
to
be
,
would
*NL*
hurry
off
at
full
speed
,
thrusting
before
it
the
mantelpiece
,
and
*NL*
sweeping
aside
the
wall
of
the
passage
;
the
well
of
the
courtyard
would
*NL*
be
enthroned
on
the
spot
where
,
a
moment
earlier
,
my
dressing-room
had
*NL*
lain
,
and
the
dwelling-place
which
I
had
built
up
for
myself
in
the
*NL*
darkness
would
have
gone
to
join
all
those
other
dwellings
of
which
I
*NL*
had
caught
glimpses
from
the
whirlpool
of
awakening
;
put
to
flight
*NL*
by
that
pale
sign
traced
above
my
window-curtains
by
the
uplifted
*NL*
forefinger
of
day
.
*NL*

SWANN
IN
LOVE
*NL*
*NL*
To
admit
you
to
the
`
little
nucleus
,
'
the
`
little
group
,
'
the
`
little
*NL*
clan
'
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
one
condition
sufficed
,
but
that
one
was
*NL*
indispensable
;
you
must
give
tacit
adherence
to
a
Creed
one
of
whose
*NL*
articles
was
that
the
young
pianist
,
whom
Mme.
Verdurin
had
taken
under
*NL*
her
patronage
that
year
,
and
of
whom
she
said
``
Really
,
it
ought
n't
to
*NL*
be
allowed
,
to
play
Wagner
as
well
as
that
!
''
left
both
Planté
*NL*
and
Rubinstein
`
sitting
'
;
while
Dr.
Cottard
was
a
more
brilliant
*NL*
diagnostician
than
Potain
.
Each
`
new
recruit
'
whom
the
Verdurins
failed
*NL*
to
persuade
that
the
evenings
spent
by
other
people
,
in
other
houses
*NL*
than
theirs
,
were
as
dull
as
ditch-water
,
saw
himself
banished
*NL*
forthwith
.
Women
being
in
this
respect
more
rebellious
than
men
,
more
*NL*
reluctant
to
lay
aside
all
worldly
curiosity
and
the
desire
to
find
out
*NL*
for
themselves
whether
other
drawing-rooms
might
not
sometimes
be
as
*NL*
entertaining
,
and
the
Verdurins
feeling
,
moreover
,
that
this
critical
*NL*
spirit
and
this
demon
of
frivolity
might
,
by
their
contagion
,
prove
*NL*
fatal
to
the
orthodoxy
of
the
little
church
,
they
had
been
obliged
to
*NL*
expel
,
one
after
another
,
all
those
of
the
`
faithful
'
who
were
of
the
*NL*
female
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apart
from
the
doctor
's
young
wife
,
they
were
reduced
almost
exclusively
*NL*
that
season
-LRB-
for
all
that
Mme.
Verdurin
herself
was
a
thoroughly
`
good
'
*NL*
woman
,
and
came
of
a
respectable
middle-class
family
,
excessively
rich
*NL*
and
wholly
undistinguished
,
with
which
she
had
gradually
and
of
her
own
*NL*
accord
severed
all
connection
-RRB-
to
a
young
woman
almost
of
a
`
certain
*NL*
class
,
'
a
Mme.
de
Crécy
,
whom
Mme.
Verdurin
called
by
her
Christian
*NL*
name
,
Odette
,
and
pronounced
a
`
love
,
'
and
to
the
pianist
's
aunt
,
who
*NL*
looked
as
though
she
had
,
at
one
period
,
`
answered
the
bell
'
:
ladies
*NL*
quite
ignorant
of
the
world
,
who
in
their
social
simplicity
were
so
*NL*
easily
led
to
believe
that
the
Princesse
de
Sagan
and
the
Duchesse
*NL*
de
Guermantes
were
obliged
to
pay
large
sums
of
money
to
other
poor
*NL*
wretches
,
in
order
to
have
anyone
at
their
dinner-parties
,
that
if
*NL*
somebody
had
offered
to
procure
them
an
invitation
to
the
house
of
*NL*
either
of
those
great
dames
,
the
old
doorkeeper
and
the
woman
of
`
easy
*NL*
virtue
'
would
have
contemptuously
declined
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Verdurins
never
invited
you
to
dinner
;
you
had
your
`
place
laid
'
*NL*
there
.
There
was
never
any
programme
for
the
evening
's
entertainment
.
*NL*
The
young
pianist
would
play
,
but
only
if
he
felt
inclined
,
for
no
one
*NL*
was
forced
to
do
anything
,
and
,
as
M.
Verdurin
used
to
say
:
``
We
're
all
*NL*
friends
here
.
Liberty
Hall
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
pianist
suggested
playing
the
Ride
of
the
Valkyries
,
or
the
*NL*
Prelude
to
Tristan
,
Mme.
Verdurin
would
protest
,
not
that
the
music
was
*NL*
displeasing
to
her
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
it
made
too
violent
an
*NL*
impression
.
``
Then
you
want
me
to
have
one
of
my
headaches
?
You
know
*NL*
quite
well
,
it
's
the
same
every
time
he
plays
that
.
I
know
what
I
'm
*NL*
in
for
.
Tomorrow
,
when
I
want
to
get
up
--
nothing
doing
!
''
If
he
was
not
*NL*
going
to
play
they
talked
,
and
one
of
the
friends
--
usually
the
painter
*NL*
who
was
in
favour
there
that
year
--
would
``
spin
,
''
as
M.
Verdurin
put
*NL*
it
,
``
a
damned
funny
yarn
that
made
'em
all
split
with
laughter
,
''
and
*NL*
especially
Mme.
Verdurin
,
for
whom
--
so
strong
was
her
habit
of
taking
*NL*
literally
the
figurative
accounts
of
her
emotions
--
Dr.
Cottard
,
who
was
*NL*
then
just
starting
in
general
practice
,
would
``
really
have
to
come
one
*NL*
day
and
set
her
jaw
,
which
she
had
dislocated
with
laughing
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
dress
was
barred
,
because
you
were
all
`
good
pals
,
'
and
did
n't
*NL*
want
to
look
like
the
`
boring
people
'
who
were
to
be
avoided
like
the
*NL*
plague
,
and
only
asked
to
the
big
evenings
,
which
were
given
as
seldom
*NL*
as
possible
,
and
then
only
if
it
would
amuse
the
painter
or
make
the
*NL*
musician
better
known
.
The
rest
of
the
time
you
were
quite
happy
playing
*NL*
charades
and
having
supper
in
fancy
dress
,
and
there
was
no
need
to
*NL*
mingle
any
strange
element
with
the
little
`
clan
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
as
the
`
good
pals
'
came
to
take
a
more
and
more
prominent
place
*NL*
in
Mme.
Verdurin
's
life
,
so
the
`
bores
,
'
the
`
nuisances
'
grew
to
include
*NL*
everybody
and
everything
that
kept
her
friends
away
from
her
,
that
made
*NL*
them
sometimes
plead
`
previous
engagements
,
'
the
mother
of
one
,
the
*NL*
professional
duties
of
another
,
the
`
little
place
in
the
country
'
of
a
*NL*
third
.
If
Dr.
Cottard
felt
bound
to
say
good
night
as
soon
as
they
rose
*NL*
from
table
,
so
as
to
go
back
to
some
patient
who
was
seriously
ill
;
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
would
say
,
``
I
'm
sure
it
will
do
him
far
more
*NL*
good
if
you
do
n't
go
disturbing
him
again
this
evening
;
he
will
have
a
*NL*
good
night
without
you
;
to-morrow
morning
you
can
go
round
early
and
you
*NL*
will
find
him
cured
.
''
From
the
beginning
of
December
it
would
make
her
*NL*
quite
ill
to
think
that
the
`
faithful
'
might
fail
her
on
Christmas
and
*NL*
New
Year
's
Days
.
The
pianist
's
aunt
insisted
that
he
must
accompany
her
,
*NL*
on
the
latter
,
to
a
family
dinner
at
her
mother
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
suppose
she
'll
die
,
your
mother
,
''
exclaimed
Mme.
Verdurin
*NL*
bitterly
,
``
if
you
do
n't
have
dinner
with
her
on
New
Year
's
Day
,
like
*NL*
people
in
the
_
provinces
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
uneasiness
was
kindled
again
in
Holy
Week
:
``
Now
you
,
Doctor
,
you
're
*NL*
a
sensible
,
broad-minded
man
;
you
'll
come
,
of
course
,
on
Good
Friday
,
*NL*
just
like
any
other
day
?
''
she
said
to
Cottard
in
the
first
year
of
the
*NL*
little
`
nucleus
,
'
in
a
loud
and
confident
voice
,
as
though
there
could
*NL*
be
no
doubt
of
his
answer
.
But
she
trembled
as
she
waited
for
it
,
for
if
*NL*
he
did
not
come
she
might
find
herself
condemned
to
dine
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
come
on
Good
Friday
--
to
say
good-bye
to
you
,
for
we
are
going
*NL*
to
spend
the
holidays
in
Auvergne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
Auvergne
?
To
be
eaten
by
fleas
and
all
sorts
of
creatures
!
A
fine
*NL*
lot
of
good
that
will
do
you
!
''
And
after
a
solemn
pause
:
``
If
you
had
*NL*
only
told
us
,
we
would
have
tried
to
get
up
a
party
,
and
all
gone
there
*NL*
together
,
comfortably
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
too
,
if
one
of
the
`
faithful
'
had
a
friend
,
or
one
of
the
ladies
*NL*
a
young
man
,
who
was
liable
,
now
and
then
,
to
make
them
miss
an
evening
,
*NL*
the
Verdurins
,
who
were
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
a
woman
's
having
a
*NL*
lover
,
provided
that
she
had
him
in
their
company
,
loved
him
in
their
*NL*
company
and
did
not
prefer
him
to
their
company
,
would
say
:
``
Very
well
,
*NL*
then
,
bring
your
friend
along
.
''
And
he
would
be
put
to
the
test
,
to
see
*NL*
whether
he
was
willing
to
have
no
secrets
from
Mme.
Verdurin
,
whether
he
*NL*
was
susceptible
of
being
enrolled
in
the
`
little
clan
.
'
If
he
failed
*NL*
to
pass
,
the
faithful
one
who
had
introduced
him
would
be
taken
on
one
*NL*
side
,
and
would
be
tactfully
assisted
to
quarrel
with
the
friend
or
*NL*
mistress
.
But
if
the
test
proved
satisfactory
,
the
newcomer
would
in
*NL*
turn
be
numbered
among
the
`
faithful
.
'
And
so
when
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
this
same
year
,
the
courtesan
told
M.
Verdurin
that
she
had
made
the
*NL*
acquaintance
of
such
a
charming
gentleman
,
M.
Swann
,
and
hinted
that
*NL*
he
would
very
much
like
to
be
allowed
to
come
,
M.
Verdurin
carried
the
*NL*
request
at
once
to
his
wife
.
He
never
formed
an
opinion
on
any
subject
*NL*
until
she
had
formed
hers
,
his
special
duty
being
to
carry
out
her
*NL*
wishes
and
those
of
the
`
faithful
'
generally
,
which
he
did
with
*NL*
boundless
ingenuity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
Mme.
de
Crécy
has
something
to
say
to
you
.
She
would
like
to
*NL*
bring
one
of
her
friends
here
,
a
M.
Swann
.
What
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
as
if
anybody
could
refuse
anything
to
a
little
piece
of
*NL*
perfection
like
that
.
Be
quiet
;
no
one
asked
your
opinion
.
I
tell
you
*NL*
that
you
are
a
piece
of
perfection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
you
like
,
''
replied
Odette
,
in
an
affected
tone
,
and
then
went
*NL*
on
:
``
You
know
I
'm
not
fishing
for
compliments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
bring
your
friend
,
if
he
's
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
there
was
no
connection
whatsoever
between
the
`
little
nucleus
'
and
*NL*
the
society
which
Swann
frequented
,
and
a
purely
worldly
man
would
*NL*
have
thought
it
hardly
worth
his
while
,
when
occupying
so
exceptional
*NL*
a
position
in
the
world
,
to
seek
an
introduction
to
the
Verdurins
.
But
*NL*
Swann
was
so
ardent
a
lover
that
,
once
he
had
got
to
know
almost
all
the
*NL*
women
of
the
aristocracy
,
once
they
had
taught
him
all
that
there
was
*NL*
to
learn
,
he
had
ceased
to
regard
those
naturalisation
papers
,
almost
a
*NL*
patent
of
nobility
,
which
the
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
had
bestowed
upon
*NL*
him
,
save
as
a
sort
of
negotiable
bond
,
a
letter
of
credit
with
no
*NL*
intrinsic
value
,
which
allowed
him
to
improvise
a
status
for
himself
in
*NL*
some
little
hole
in
the
country
,
or
in
some
obscure
quarter
of
Paris
,
*NL*
where
the
good-looking
daughter
of
a
local
squire
or
solicitor
had
taken
*NL*
his
fancy
.
For
at
such
times
desire
,
or
love
itself
,
would
revive
in
*NL*
him
a
feeling
of
vanity
from
which
he
was
now
quite
free
in
his
everyday
*NL*
life
,
although
it
was
,
no
doubt
,
the
same
feeling
which
had
originally
*NL*
prompted
him
towards
that
career
as
a
man
of
fashion
in
which
he
had
*NL*
squandered
his
intellectual
gifts
upon
frivolous
amusements
,
and
had
*NL*
made
use
of
his
erudition
in
matters
of
art
only
to
advise
society
*NL*
ladies
what
pictures
to
buy
and
how
to
decorate
their
houses
;
and
this
*NL*
vanity
it
was
which
made
him
eager
to
shine
,
in
the
sight
of
any
fair
*NL*
unknown
who
had
captivated
him
for
the
moment
,
with
a
brilliance
which
*NL*
the
name
of
Swann
by
itself
did
not
emit
.
And
he
was
most
eager
when
the
*NL*
fair
unknown
was
in
humble
circumstances
.
Just
as
it
is
not
by
other
*NL*
men
of
intelligence
that
an
intelligent
man
is
afraid
of
being
thought
*NL*
a
fool
,
so
it
is
not
by
the
great
gentleman
but
by
boors
and
`
bounders
'
*NL*
that
a
man
of
fashion
is
afraid
of
finding
his
social
value
underrated
.
*NL*
Three-fourths
of
the
mental
ingenuity
displayed
,
of
the
social
*NL*
falsehoods
scattered
broadcast
ever
since
the
world
began
by
people
*NL*
whose
importance
they
have
served
only
to
diminish
,
have
been
aimed
at
*NL*
inferiors
.
And
Swann
,
who
behaved
quite
simply
and
was
at
his
ease
when
*NL*
with
a
duchess
,
would
tremble
for
fear
of
being
despised
,
and
would
*NL*
instantly
begin
to
pose
,
were
he
to
meet
her
grace
's
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unlike
so
many
people
,
who
,
either
from
lack
of
energy
or
else
from
a
*NL*
resigned
sense
of
the
obligation
laid
upon
them
by
their
social
grandeur
*NL*
to
remain
moored
like
houseboats
to
a
certain
point
on
the
bank
of
the
*NL*
stream
of
life
,
abstain
from
the
pleasures
which
are
offered
to
them
*NL*
above
and
below
that
point
,
that
degree
in
life
in
which
they
will
*NL*
remain
fixed
until
the
day
of
their
death
,
and
are
content
,
in
the
*NL*
end
,
to
describe
as
pleasures
,
for
want
of
any
better
,
those
mediocre
*NL*
distractions
,
that
just
not
intolerable
tedium
which
is
enclosed
there
*NL*
with
them
;
Swann
would
endeavour
not
to
find
charm
and
beauty
in
the
*NL*
women
with
whom
he
must
pass
time
,
but
to
pass
his
time
among
women
whom
*NL*
he
had
already
found
to
be
beautiful
and
charming
.
And
these
were
,
as
*NL*
often
as
not
,
women
whose
beauty
was
of
a
distinctly
`
common
'
type
,
for
*NL*
the
physical
qualities
which
attracted
him
instinctively
,
and
without
*NL*
reason
,
were
the
direct
opposite
of
those
that
he
admired
in
the
women
*NL*
painted
or
sculptured
by
his
favourite
masters
.
Depth
of
character
,
or
*NL*
a
melancholy
expression
on
a
woman
's
face
would
freeze
his
senses
,
which
*NL*
would
,
however
,
immediately
melt
at
the
sight
of
healthy
,
abundant
,
rosy
*NL*
human
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
on
his
travels
he
met
a
family
whom
it
would
have
been
more
correct
*NL*
for
him
to
make
no
attempt
to
know
,
but
among
whom
a
woman
caught
his
*NL*
eye
,
adorned
with
a
special
charm
that
was
new
to
him
,
to
remain
on
his
*NL*
`
high
horse
'
and
to
cheat
the
desire
that
she
had
kindled
in
him
,
to
*NL*
substitute
a
pleasure
different
from
that
which
he
might
have
tasted
in
*NL*
her
company
by
writing
to
invite
one
of
his
former
mistresses
to
come
*NL*
and
join
him
,
would
have
seemed
to
him
as
cowardly
an
abdication
in
the
*NL*
face
of
life
,
as
stupid
a
renunciation
of
a
new
form
of
happiness
as
if
,
*NL*
instead
of
visiting
the
country
where
he
was
,
he
had
shut
himself
up
in
*NL*
his
own
rooms
and
looked
at
`
views
'
of
Paris
.
He
did
not
immure
himself
*NL*
in
the
solid
structure
of
his
social
relations
,
but
had
made
of
them
,
so
*NL*
as
to
be
able
to
set
it
up
afresh
upon
new
foundations
wherever
a
woman
*NL*
might
take
his
fancy
,
one
of
those
collapsible
tents
which
explorers
*NL*
carry
about
with
them
.
Any
part
of
it
which
was
not
portable
or
could
*NL*
not
be
adapted
to
some
fresh
pleasure
he
would
discard
as
valueless
,
*NL*
however
enviable
it
might
appear
to
others
.
How
often
had
his
credit
*NL*
with
a
duchess
,
built
up
of
the
yearly
accumulation
of
her
desire
to
*NL*
do
him
some
favour
for
which
she
had
never
found
an
opportunity
,
been
*NL*
squandered
in
a
moment
by
his
calling
upon
her
,
in
an
indiscreetly
*NL*
worded
message
,
for
a
recommendation
by
telegraph
which
would
put
him
*NL*
in
touch
at
once
with
one
of
her
agents
whose
daughter
he
had
noticed
in
*NL*
the
country
,
just
as
a
starving
man
might
barter
a
diamond
for
a
crust
*NL*
of
bread
.
Indeed
,
when
it
was
too
late
,
he
would
laugh
at
himself
for
*NL*
it
,
for
there
was
in
his
nature
,
redeemed
by
many
rare
refinements
,
an
*NL*
element
of
clownishness
.
Then
he
belonged
to
that
class
of
intelligent
*NL*
men
who
have
led
a
life
of
idleness
,
and
who
seek
consolation
and
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
an
excuse
in
the
idea
,
which
their
idleness
offers
to
their
*NL*
intelligence
,
of
objects
as
worthy
of
their
interest
as
any
that
could
*NL*
be
attained
by
art
or
learning
,
the
idea
that
`
Life
'
contains
situations
*NL*
more
interesting
and
more
romantic
than
all
the
romances
ever
written
.
*NL*
So
,
at
least
,
he
would
assure
and
had
no
difficulty
in
persuading
the
*NL*
more
subtle
among
his
friends
in
the
fashionable
world
,
notably
the
*NL*
Baron
de
Charlus
,
whom
he
liked
to
amuse
with
stories
of
the
startling
*NL*
adventures
that
had
befallen
him
,
such
as
when
he
had
met
a
woman
in
the
*NL*
train
,
and
had
taken
her
home
with
him
,
before
discovering
that
she
was
*NL*
the
sister
of
a
reigning
monarch
,
in
whose
hands
were
gathered
,
at
that
*NL*
moment
,
all
the
threads
of
European
politics
,
of
which
he
found
himself
*NL*
kept
informed
in
the
most
delightful
fashion
,
or
when
,
in
the
complexity
*NL*
of
circumstances
,
it
depended
upon
the
choice
which
the
Conclave
*NL*
was
about
to
make
whether
he
might
or
might
not
become
the
lover
of
*NL*
somebody
's
cook
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
only
the
brilliant
phalanx
of
virtuous
dowagers
,
generals
*NL*
and
academicians
,
to
whom
he
was
bound
by
such
close
ties
,
that
Swann
*NL*
compelled
with
so
much
cynicism
to
serve
him
as
panders
.
All
his
friends
*NL*
were
accustomed
to
receive
,
from
time
to
time
,
letters
which
called
on
*NL*
them
for
a
word
of
recommendation
or
introduction
,
with
a
diplomatic
*NL*
adroitness
which
,
persisting
throughout
all
his
successive
`
affairs
'
*NL*
and
using
different
pretexts
,
revealed
more
glaringly
than
the
clumsiest
*NL*
indiscretion
,
a
permanent
trait
in
his
character
and
an
unvarying
quest
.
*NL*
I
used
often
to
recall
to
myself
when
,
many
years
later
,
I
began
to
*NL*
take
an
interest
in
his
character
because
of
the
similarities
which
,
in
*NL*
wholly
different
respects
,
it
offered
to
my
own
,
how
,
when
he
used
to
*NL*
write
to
my
grandfather
-LRB-
though
not
at
the
time
we
are
now
considering
,
*NL*
for
it
was
about
the
date
of
my
own
birth
that
Swann
's
great
`
affair
'
*NL*
began
,
and
made
a
long
interruption
in
his
amatory
practices
-RRB-
the
*NL*
latter
,
recognising
his
friend
's
handwriting
on
the
envelope
,
would
*NL*
exclaim
:
``
Here
is
Swann
asking
for
something
;
on
guard
!
''
And
,
either
*NL*
from
distrust
or
from
the
unconscious
spirit
of
devilry
which
urges
us
*NL*
to
offer
a
thing
only
to
those
who
do
not
want
it
,
my
grandparents
would
*NL*
meet
with
an
obstinate
refusal
the
most
easily
satisfied
of
his
prayers
,
*NL*
as
when
he
begged
them
for
an
introduction
to
a
girl
who
dined
with
us
*NL*
every
Sunday
,
and
whom
they
were
obliged
,
whenever
Swann
mentioned
her
,
*NL*
to
pretend
that
they
no
longer
saw
,
although
they
would
be
wondering
,
*NL*
all
through
the
week
,
whom
they
could
invite
to
meet
her
,
and
often
*NL*
failed
,
in
the
end
,
to
find
anyone
,
sooner
than
make
a
sign
to
him
who
*NL*
would
so
gladly
have
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occasionally
a
couple
of
my
grandparents
'
acquaintance
,
who
had
been
*NL*
complaining
for
some
time
that
they
never
saw
Swann
now
,
would
announce
*NL*
with
satisfaction
,
and
perhaps
with
a
slight
inclination
to
make
my
*NL*
grandparents
envious
of
them
,
that
he
had
suddenly
become
as
charming
as
*NL*
he
could
possibly
be
,
and
was
never
out
of
their
house
.
My
grandfather
*NL*
would
not
care
to
shatter
their
pleasant
illusion
,
but
would
look
at
my
*NL*
grandmother
,
as
he
hummed
the
air
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
this
mystery
?
*NL*
I
can
not
understand
it
;
*NL*
*NL*
or
of
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vision
fugitive
...
;
*NL*
In
matters
such
as
this
*NL*
'T
is
best
to
close
one
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
months
later
,
if
my
grandfather
asked
Swann
's
new
friend
``
What
*NL*
about
Swann
?
Do
you
still
see
as
much
of
him
as
ever
?
''
the
other
's
face
*NL*
would
lengthen
:
``
Never
mention
his
name
to
me
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
that
you
were
such
friends
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
intimate
in
this
way
for
several
months
with
some
cousins
*NL*
of
my
grandmother
,
dining
almost
every
evening
at
their
house
.
Suddenly
,
*NL*
and
without
any
warning
,
he
ceased
to
appear
.
They
supposed
him
to
be
*NL*
ill
,
and
the
lady
of
the
house
was
going
to
send
to
inquire
for
him
*NL*
when
,
in
her
kitchen
,
she
found
a
letter
in
his
hand
,
which
her
cook
had
*NL*
left
by
accident
in
the
housekeeping
book
.
In
this
he
announced
that
he
*NL*
was
leaving
Paris
and
would
not
be
able
to
come
to
the
house
again
.
The
*NL*
cook
had
been
his
mistress
,
and
at
the
moment
of
breaking
off
relations
*NL*
she
was
the
only
one
of
the
household
whom
he
had
thought
it
necessary
*NL*
to
inform
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
his
mistress
for
the
time
being
was
a
woman
in
society
,
or
at
*NL*
least
one
whose
birth
was
not
so
lowly
,
nor
her
position
so
irregular
*NL*
that
he
was
unable
to
arrange
for
her
reception
in
`
society
,
'
then
for
*NL*
her
sake
he
would
return
to
it
,
but
only
to
the
particular
orbit
in
*NL*
which
she
moved
or
into
which
he
had
drawn
her
.
``
No
good
depending
on
*NL*
Swann
for
this
evening
,
''
people
would
say
;
``
do
n't
you
remember
,
it
's
his
*NL*
American
's
night
at
the
Opera
?
''
He
would
secure
invitations
for
her
to
*NL*
the
most
exclusive
drawing-rooms
,
to
those
houses
where
he
himself
*NL*
went
regularly
,
for
weekly
dinners
or
for
poker
;
every
evening
,
after
*NL*
a
slight
`
wave
'
imparted
to
his
stiffly
brushed
red
locks
had
tempered
*NL*
with
a
certain
softness
the
ardour
of
his
bold
green
eyes
,
he
would
*NL*
select
a
flower
for
his
buttonhole
and
set
out
to
meet
his
mistress
at
*NL*
the
house
of
one
or
other
of
the
women
of
his
circle
;
and
then
,
thinking
*NL*
of
the
affection
and
admiration
which
the
fashionable
folk
,
whom
he
*NL*
always
treated
exactly
as
he
pleased
,
would
,
when
he
met
them
there
,
*NL*
lavish
upon
him
in
the
presence
of
the
woman
whom
he
loved
,
he
would
*NL*
find
a
fresh
charm
in
that
worldly
existence
of
which
he
had
grown
*NL*
weary
,
but
whose
substance
,
pervaded
and
warmly
coloured
by
the
*NL*
flickering
light
which
he
had
slipped
into
its
midst
,
seemed
to
him
*NL*
beautiful
and
rare
,
now
that
he
had
incorporated
in
it
a
fresh
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
each
of
these
attachments
,
each
of
these
flirtations
had
been
*NL*
the
realisation
,
more
or
less
complete
,
of
a
dream
born
of
the
sight
of
*NL*
a
face
or
a
form
which
Swann
had
spontaneously
,
and
without
effort
on
*NL*
his
part
,
found
charming
,
it
was
quite
another
matter
when
,
one
day
at
*NL*
the
theatre
,
he
was
introduced
to
Odette
de
Crécy
by
an
old
friend
of
*NL*
his
own
,
who
had
spoken
of
her
to
him
as
a
ravishing
creature
with
whom
*NL*
he
might
very
possibly
come
to
an
understanding
;
but
had
made
her
out
*NL*
to
be
harder
of
conquest
than
she
actually
was
,
so
as
to
appear
to
be
*NL*
conferring
a
special
favour
by
the
introduction
.
She
had
struck
Swann
*NL*
not
,
certainly
,
as
being
devoid
of
beauty
,
but
as
endowed
with
a
style
*NL*
of
beauty
which
left
him
indifferent
,
which
aroused
in
him
no
desire
,
*NL*
which
gave
him
,
indeed
,
a
sort
of
physical
repulsion
;
as
one
of
those
*NL*
women
of
whom
every
man
can
name
some
,
and
each
will
name
different
*NL*
examples
,
who
are
the
converse
of
the
type
which
our
senses
demand
.
To
*NL*
give
him
any
pleasure
her
profile
was
too
sharp
,
her
skin
too
delicate
,
*NL*
her
cheek-bones
too
prominent
,
her
features
too
tightly
drawn
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
were
fine
,
but
so
large
that
they
seemed
to
be
bending
beneath
their
own
*NL*
weight
,
strained
the
rest
of
her
face
and
always
made
her
appear
unwell
*NL*
or
in
an
ill
humour
.
Some
time
after
this
introduction
at
the
theatre
*NL*
she
had
written
to
ask
Swann
whether
she
might
see
his
collections
,
*NL*
which
would
interest
her
so
much
,
she
,
``
an
ignorant
woman
with
a
taste
*NL*
for
beautiful
things
,
''
saying
that
she
would
know
him
better
when
*NL*
once
she
had
seen
him
in
his
`
home
,
'
where
she
imagined
him
to
be
``
so
*NL*
comfortable
with
his
tea
and
his
books
''
;
although
she
had
not
concealed
*NL*
her
surprise
at
his
being
in
that
part
of
the
town
,
which
must
be
so
*NL*
depressing
,
and
was
``
not
nearly
smart
enough
for
such
a
very
smart
man
.
''
*NL*
And
when
he
allowed
her
to
come
she
had
said
to
him
as
she
left
how
*NL*
sorry
she
was
to
have
stayed
so
short
a
time
in
a
house
into
which
she
*NL*
was
so
glad
to
have
found
her
way
at
last
,
speaking
of
him
as
though
he
*NL*
had
meant
something
more
to
her
than
the
rest
of
the
people
she
knew
,
*NL*
and
appearing
to
unite
their
two
selves
with
a
kind
of
romantic
bond
*NL*
which
had
made
him
smile
.
But
at
the
time
of
life
,
tinged
already
with
*NL*
disenchantment
,
which
Swann
was
approaching
,
when
a
man
can
content
*NL*
himself
with
being
in
love
for
the
pleasure
of
loving
without
expecting
*NL*
too
much
in
return
,
this
linking
of
hearts
,
if
it
is
no
longer
,
as
in
*NL*
early
youth
,
the
goal
towards
which
love
,
of
necessity
,
tends
,
still
*NL*
is
bound
to
love
by
so
strong
an
association
of
ideas
that
it
may
well
*NL*
become
the
cause
of
love
if
it
presents
itself
first
.
In
his
younger
*NL*
days
a
man
dreams
of
possessing
the
heart
of
the
woman
whom
he
loves
;
*NL*
later
,
the
feeling
that
he
possesses
the
heart
of
a
woman
may
be
enough
*NL*
to
make
him
fall
in
love
with
her
.
And
50
,
at
an
age
when
it
would
*NL*
appear
--
since
one
seeks
in
love
before
everything
else
a
subjective
*NL*
pleasure
--
that
the
taste
for
feminine
beauty
must
play
the
larger
part
*NL*
in
its
procreation
,
love
may
come
into
being
,
love
of
the
most
physical
*NL*
order
,
without
any
foundation
in
desire
.
At
this
time
of
life
a
man
has
*NL*
already
been
wounded
more
than
once
by
the
darts
of
love
;
it
no
longer
*NL*
evolves
by
itself
,
obeying
its
own
incomprehensible
and
fatal
laws
,
*NL*
before
his
passive
and
astonished
heart
.
We
come
to
its
aid
;
we
falsify
*NL*
it
by
memory
and
by
suggestion
;
recognising
one
of
its
symptoms
we
*NL*
recall
and
recreate
the
rest
.
Since
we
possess
its
hymn
,
engraved
on
*NL*
our
hearts
in
its
entirety
,
there
is
no
need
of
any
woman
to
repeat
the
*NL*
opening
lines
,
potent
with
the
admiration
which
her
beauty
inspires
,
for
*NL*
us
to
remember
all
that
follows
.
And
if
she
begin
in
the
middle
,
where
*NL*
it
sings
of
our
existing
,
henceforward
,
for
one
another
only
,
we
are
*NL*
well
enough
attuned
to
that
music
to
be
able
to
take
it
up
and
follow
*NL*
our
partner
,
without
hesitation
,
at
the
first
pause
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Odette
de
Crécy
came
again
to
see
Swann
;
her
visits
grew
more
frequent
,
*NL*
and
doubtless
each
visit
revived
the
sense
of
disappointment
which
he
*NL*
felt
at
the
sight
of
a
face
whose
details
he
had
somewhat
forgotten
in
*NL*
the
interval
,
not
remembering
it
as
either
so
expressive
or
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
her
youth
,
so
faded
;
he
used
to
regret
,
while
she
was
talking
to
*NL*
him
,
that
her
really
considerable
beauty
was
not
of
the
kind
which
he
*NL*
spontaneously
admired
.
It
must
be
remarked
that
Odette
's
face
appeared
*NL*
thinner
and
more
prominent
than
it
actually
was
,
because
her
forehead
*NL*
and
the
upper
part
of
her
cheeks
,
a
single
and
almost
plane
surface
,
*NL*
were
covered
by
the
masses
of
hair
which
women
wore
at
that
period
,
*NL*
drawn
forward
in
a
fringe
,
raised
in
crimped
waves
and
falling
in
stray
*NL*
locks
over
her
ears
;
while
as
for
her
figure
,
and
she
was
admirably
*NL*
built
,
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
its
continuity
-LRB-
on
account
of
*NL*
the
fashion
then
prevailing
,
and
in
spite
of
her
being
one
of
the
*NL*
best-dressed
women
in
Paris
-RRB-
for
the
corset
,
jetting
forwards
in
an
*NL*
arch
,
as
though
over
an
imaginary
stomach
,
and
ending
in
a
sharp
point
,
*NL*
beneath
which
bulged
out
the
balloon
of
her
double
skirts
,
gave
a
woman
,
*NL*
that
year
,
the
appearance
of
being
composed
of
different
sections
badly
*NL*
fitted
together
;
to
such
an
extent
did
the
frills
,
the
flounces
,
the
*NL*
inner
bodice
follow
,
in
complete
independence
,
controlled
only
by
the
*NL*
fancy
of
their
designer
or
the
rigidity
of
their
material
,
the
line
*NL*
which
led
them
to
the
knots
of
ribbon
,
falls
of
lace
,
fringes
of
*NL*
vertically
hanging
jet
,
or
carried
them
along
the
bust
,
but
nowhere
*NL*
attached
themselves
to
the
living
creature
,
who
,
according
as
the
*NL*
architecture
of
their
fripperies
drew
them
towards
or
away
from
her
*NL*
own
,
found
herself
either
strait-laced
to
suffocation
or
else
completely
*NL*
buried
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
after
Odette
had
left
him
,
Swann
would
think
with
a
smile
of
her
*NL*
telling
him
how
the
time
would
drag
until
he
allowed
her
to
come
again
;
*NL*
he
remembered
the
anxious
,
timid
way
in
which
she
had
once
begged
him
*NL*
that
it
might
not
be
very
long
,
and
the
way
in
which
she
had
looked
at
*NL*
him
then
,
fixing
upon
him
her
fearful
and
imploring
gaze
,
which
gave
her
*NL*
a
touching
air
beneath
the
bunches
of
artificial
pansies
fastened
in
*NL*
the
front
of
her
round
bonnet
of
white
straw
,
tied
with
strings
of
black
*NL*
velvet
.
``
And
wo
n't
you
,
''
she
had
ventured
,
``
come
just
once
and
take
tea
*NL*
with
me
?
''
He
had
pleaded
pressure
of
work
,
an
essay
--
which
,
in
reality
,
*NL*
he
had
abandoned
years
ago
--
on
Vermeer
of
Delft
.
``
I
know
that
I
am
quite
*NL*
useless
,
''
she
had
replied
,
``
a
little
wild
thing
like
me
beside
a
learned
*NL*
great
man
like
you
.
I
should
be
like
the
frog
in
the
fable
!
And
yet
I
*NL*
should
so
much
like
to
learn
,
to
know
things
,
to
be
initiated
.
What
fun
*NL*
it
would
be
to
become
a
regular
bookworm
,
to
bury
my
nose
in
a
lot
of
*NL*
old
papers
!
''
she
had
gone
on
,
with
that
self-satisfied
air
which
a
smart
*NL*
woman
adopts
when
she
insists
that
her
one
desire
is
to
give
herself
*NL*
up
,
without
fear
of
soiling
her
fingers
,
to
some
unclean
task
,
such
as
*NL*
cooking
the
dinner
,
with
her
``
hands
right
in
the
dish
itself
.
''
``
You
will
*NL*
only
laugh
at
me
,
but
this
painter
who
stops
you
from
seeing
me
,
''
she
*NL*
meant
Vermeer
,
``
I
have
never
even
heard
of
him
;
is
he
alive
still
?
Can
I
*NL*
see
any
of
his
things
in
Paris
,
so
as
to
have
some
idea
of
what
is
going
*NL*
on
behind
that
great
brow
which
works
so
hard
,
that
head
which
I
feel
*NL*
sure
is
always
puzzling
away
about
things
;
just
to
be
able
to
say
*NL*
`
There
,
that
's
what
he
's
thinking
about
!
'
What
a
dream
it
would
be
to
be
*NL*
able
to
help
you
with
your
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
sought
an
excuse
in
his
fear
of
forming
new
friendships
,
which
he
*NL*
gallantly
described
as
his
fear
of
a
hopeless
passion
.
``
You
are
afraid
*NL*
of
falling
in
love
?
How
funny
that
is
,
when
I
go
about
seeking
nothing
*NL*
else
,
and
would
give
my
soul
just
to
find
a
little
love
somewhere
!
''
she
*NL*
had
said
,
so
naturally
and
with
such
an
air
of
conviction
that
he
had
*NL*
been
genuinely
touched
.
``
Some
woman
must
have
made
you
suffer
.
And
you
*NL*
think
that
the
rest
are
all
like
her
.
She
ca
n't
have
understood
you
:
you
*NL*
are
so
utterly
different
from
ordinary
men
.
That
's
what
I
liked
about
*NL*
you
when
I
first
saw
you
;
I
felt
at
once
that
you
were
n't
like
everybody
*NL*
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
besides
,
there
's
yourself
--
''
he
had
continued
,
``
I
know
what
*NL*
women
are
;
you
must
have
a
whole
heap
of
things
to
do
,
and
never
any
*NL*
time
to
spare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Why
,
I
have
never
anything
to
do
.
I
am
always
free
,
and
I
always
*NL*
will
be
free
if
you
want
me
.
At
whatever
hour
of
the
day
or
night
it
may
*NL*
suit
you
to
see
me
,
just
send
for
me
,
and
I
shall
be
only
too
delighted
*NL*
to
come
.
Will
you
do
that
?
Do
you
know
what
I
should
really
like
--
to
*NL*
introduce
you
to
Mme.
Verdurin
,
where
I
go
every
evening
.
Just
fancy
my
*NL*
finding
you
there
,
and
thinking
that
it
was
a
little
for
my
sake
that
*NL*
you
had
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
,
in
thus
remembering
their
conversations
,
in
thinking
about
her
*NL*
thus
when
he
was
alone
,
he
did
no
more
than
call
her
image
into
being
*NL*
among
those
of
countless
other
women
in
his
romantic
dreams
;
but
if
,
*NL*
thanks
to
some
accidental
circumstance
-LRB-
or
even
perhaps
without
that
*NL*
assistance
,
for
the
circumstance
which
presents
itself
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
a
mental
state
,
hitherto
latent
,
makes
itself
felt
,
may
well
have
*NL*
had
no
influence
whatsoever
upon
that
state
-RRB-
,
the
image
of
Odette
de
*NL*
Crécy
came
to
absorb
the
whole
of
his
dreams
,
if
from
those
dreams
*NL*
the
memory
of
her
could
no
longer
be
eliminated
,
then
her
bodily
*NL*
imperfections
would
no
longer
be
of
the
least
importance
,
nor
would
the
*NL*
conformity
of
her
body
,
more
or
less
than
any
other
,
to
the
requirements
*NL*
of
Swann
's
taste
;
since
,
having
become
the
body
of
her
whom
he
loved
,
it
*NL*
must
henceforth
be
the
only
one
capable
of
causing
him
joy
or
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
my
grandfather
had
known
--
which
was
more
than
could
*NL*
be
said
of
any
other
actual
acquaintance
--
the
family
of
these
Verdurins
.
*NL*
But
he
had
entirely
severed
his
connection
with
what
he
called
``
young
*NL*
Verdurin
,
''
taking
a
general
view
of
him
as
one
who
had
fallen
--
though
*NL*
without
losing
hold
of
his
millions
--
among
the
riff-raff
of
Bohemia
.
One
*NL*
day
he
received
a
letter
from
Swann
asking
whether
my
grandfather
could
*NL*
put
him
in
touch
with
the
Verdurins
.
``
On
guard
!
on
guard
!
''
he
exclaimed
*NL*
as
he
read
it
,
``
I
am
not
at
all
surprised
;
Swann
was
bound
to
finish
up
*NL*
like
this
.
A
nice
lot
of
people
!
I
can
not
do
what
he
asks
,
because
,
in
*NL*
the
first
place
,
I
no
longer
know
the
gentleman
in
question
.
Besides
,
*NL*
there
must
be
a
woman
in
it
somewhere
,
and
I
do
n't
mix
myself
up
in
such
*NL*
matters
.
Ah
,
well
,
we
shall
see
some
fun
if
Swann
begins
running
after
*NL*
the
little
Verdurins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
my
grandfather
's
refusal
to
act
as
sponsor
,
it
was
Odette
herself
*NL*
who
had
taken
Swann
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Verdurins
had
had
dining
with
them
,
on
the
day
when
Swann
made
his
*NL*
first
appearance
,
Dr.
and
Mme.
Cottard
,
the
young
pianist
and
his
aunt
,
*NL*
and
the
painter
then
in
favour
,
while
these
were
joined
,
in
the
course
*NL*
of
the
evening
,
by
several
more
of
the
`
faithful
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Cottard
was
never
quite
certain
of
the
tone
in
which
he
ought
to
*NL*
reply
to
any
observation
,
or
whether
the
speaker
was
jesting
or
*NL*
in
earnest
.
And
so
in
any
event
he
would
embellish
all
his
facial
*NL*
expressions
with
the
offer
of
a
conditional
,
a
provisional
smile
whose
*NL*
expectant
subtlety
would
exonerate
him
from
the
charge
of
being
a
*NL*
simpleton
,
if
the
remark
addressed
to
him
should
turn
out
to
have
been
*NL*
facetious
.
But
as
he
must
also
be
prepared
to
face
the
alternative
,
he
*NL*
never
dared
to
allow
this
smile
a
definite
expression
on
his
features
,
*NL*
and
you
would
see
there
a
perpetually
flickering
uncertainty
,
in
which
*NL*
you
might
decipher
the
question
that
he
never
dared
to
ask
:
``
Do
you
*NL*
really
mean
that
?
''
He
was
no
more
confident
of
the
manner
in
which
he
*NL*
ought
to
conduct
himself
in
the
street
,
or
indeed
in
life
generally
,
*NL*
than
he
was
in
a
drawing-room
;
and
he
might
be
seen
greeting
passers-by
,
*NL*
carriages
,
and
anything
that
occurred
with
a
malicious
smile
which
*NL*
absolved
his
subsequent
behaviour
of
all
impropriety
,
since
it
proved
,
*NL*
if
it
should
turn
out
unsuited
to
the
occasion
,
that
he
was
well
aware
*NL*
of
that
,
and
that
if
he
had
assumed
a
smile
,
the
jest
was
a
secret
of
*NL*
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
all
those
points
,
however
,
where
a
plain
question
appeared
to
him
to
*NL*
be
permissible
,
the
Doctor
was
unsparing
in
his
endeavours
to
cultivate
*NL*
the
wilderness
of
his
ignorance
and
uncertainty
and
so
to
complete
his
*NL*
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
that
,
following
the
advice
given
him
by
a
wise
mother
on
his
*NL*
first
coming
up
to
the
capital
from
his
provincial
home
,
he
would
never
*NL*
let
pass
either
a
figure
of
speech
or
a
proper
name
that
was
new
to
him
*NL*
without
an
effort
to
secure
the
fullest
information
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
regards
figures
of
speech
,
he
was
insatiable
in
his
thirst
for
*NL*
knowledge
,
for
often
imagining
them
to
have
a
more
definite
meaning
than
*NL*
was
actually
the
case
,
he
would
want
to
know
what
,
exactly
,
was
intended
*NL*
by
those
which
he
most
frequently
heard
used
:
`
devilish
pretty
,
'
`
blue
*NL*
blood
,
'
'
a
cat
and
dog
life
,
'
'
a
day
of
reckoning
,
'
'
a
queen
of
fashion
,
*NL*
`
to
give
a
free
hand
,
'
`
to
be
at
a
deadlock
,
'
and
so
forth
;
and
in
*NL*
what
particular
circumstances
he
himself
might
make
use
of
them
in
*NL*
conversation
.
Failing
these
,
he
would
adorn
it
with
puns
and
other
*NL*
`
plays
upon
words
'
which
he
had
learned
by
rote
.
As
for
the
names
of
*NL*
strangers
which
were
uttered
in
his
hearing
,
he
used
merely
to
repeat
*NL*
them
to
himself
in
a
questioning
tone
,
which
,
he
thought
,
would
suffice
*NL*
to
furnish
him
with
explanations
for
which
he
would
not
ostensibly
seek
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
critical
faculty
,
on
the
universal
application
of
which
he
prided
*NL*
himself
,
was
,
in
reality
,
completely
lacking
,
that
refinement
of
good
*NL*
breeding
which
consists
in
assuring
some
one
whom
you
are
obliging
in
*NL*
any
way
,
without
expecting
to
be
believed
,
that
it
is
really
yourself
*NL*
that
is
obliged
to
him
,
was
wasted
on
Cottard
,
who
took
everything
that
*NL*
he
heard
in
its
literal
sense
.
However
blind
she
may
have
been
to
his
*NL*
faults
,
Mme.
Verdurin
was
genuinely
annoyed
,
though
she
still
continued
*NL*
to
regard
him
as
brilliantly
clever
,
when
,
after
she
had
invited
him
to
*NL*
see
and
hear
Sarah
Bernhardt
from
a
stage
box
,
and
had
said
politely
:
*NL*
``
It
is
very
good
of
you
to
have
come
,
Doctor
,
especially
as
I
'm
sure
*NL*
you
must
often
have
heard
Sarah
Bernhardt
;
and
besides
,
I
'm
afraid
we
're
*NL*
rather
too
near
the
stage
,
''
the
Doctor
,
who
had
come
into
the
box
with
a
*NL*
smile
which
waited
before
settling
upon
or
vanishing
from
his
face
*NL*
until
some
one
in
authority
should
enlighten
him
as
to
the
merits
of
the
*NL*
spectacle
,
replied
:
``
To
be
sure
,
we
are
far
too
near
the
stage
,
and
*NL*
one
is
getting
sick
of
Sarah
Bernhardt
.
But
you
expressed
a
wish
that
*NL*
I
should
come
.
For
me
,
your
wish
is
a
command
.
I
am
only
too
glad
to
be
*NL*
able
to
do
you
this
little
service
.
What
would
one
not
do
to
please
you
,
*NL*
you
are
so
good
.
''
And
he
went
on
,
``
Sarah
Bernhardt
;
that
's
what
they
*NL*
call
the
Voice
of
God
,
ai
n't
it
?
You
see
,
often
,
too
,
that
she
`
sets
the
*NL*
boards
on
fire
.
'
That
's
an
odd
expression
,
ai
n't
it
?
''
in
the
hope
of
an
*NL*
enlightening
commentary
,
which
,
however
,
was
not
forthcoming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'you
know
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
had
said
to
her
husband
,
``
I
believe
we
are
*NL*
going
the
wrong
way
to
work
when
we
depreciate
anything
we
offer
the
*NL*
Doctor
.
He
is
a
scientist
who
lives
quite
apart
from
our
everyday
*NL*
existence
;
he
knows
nothing
himself
of
what
things
are
worth
,
and
he
*NL*
accepts
everything
that
we
say
as
gospel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
dared
to
mention
it
,
''
M.
Verdurin
had
answered
,
``
but
I
've
*NL*
noticed
the
same
thing
myself
.
''
And
on
the
following
New
Year
's
Day
,
*NL*
instead
of
sending
Dr.
Cottard
a
ruby
that
cost
three
thousand
francs
,
*NL*
and
pretending
that
it
was
a
mere
trifle
,
M.
Verdurin
bought
an
*NL*
artificial
stone
for
three
hundred
,
and
let
it
be
understood
that
it
was
*NL*
something
almost
impossible
to
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mme.
Verdurin
had
announced
that
they
were
to
see
M.
Swann
that
*NL*
evening
;
``
Swann
!
''
the
Doctor
had
exclaimed
in
a
tone
rendered
brutal
*NL*
by
his
astonishment
,
for
the
smallest
piece
of
news
would
always
take
*NL*
utterly
unawares
this
man
who
imagined
himself
to
be
perpetually
in
*NL*
readiness
for
anything
.
And
seeing
that
no
one
answered
him
,
``
Swann
!
Who
*NL*
on
earth
is
Swann
?
''
he
shouted
,
in
a
frenzy
of
anxiety
which
subsided
*NL*
as
soon
as
Mme.
Verdurin
had
explained
,
``
Why
,
Odette
's
friend
,
whom
she
*NL*
told
us
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good
,
good
;
that
's
all
right
,
then
,
''
answered
the
Doctor
,
at
once
*NL*
mollified
.
As
for
the
painter
,
he
was
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
*NL*
Swann
's
appearing
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
because
he
supposed
him
to
be
in
*NL*
love
with
Odette
,
and
was
always
ready
to
assist
at
lovers
'
meetings
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
amuses
me
more
than
match-making
,
''
he
confided
to
Cottard
;
``
I
*NL*
have
been
tremendously
successful
,
even
with
women
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
telling
the
Verdurins
that
Swann
was
extremely
`
smart
,
'
Odette
had
*NL*
alarmed
them
with
the
prospect
of
another
`
bore
.
'
When
he
arrived
,
*NL*
however
,
he
made
an
excellent
impression
,
an
indirect
cause
of
which
,
*NL*
though
they
did
not
know
it
,
was
his
familiarity
with
the
best
society
.
*NL*
He
had
,
indeed
,
one
of
those
advantages
which
men
who
have
lived
and
*NL*
moved
in
the
world
enjoy
over
others
,
even
men
of
intelligence
and
*NL*
refinement
,
who
have
never
gone
into
society
,
namely
that
they
no
longer
*NL*
see
it
transfigured
by
the
longing
or
repulsion
with
which
it
fills
*NL*
the
imagination
,
but
regard
it
as
quite
unimportant
.
Their
good
nature
,
*NL*
freed
from
all
taint
of
snobbishness
and
from
the
fear
of
seeming
*NL*
too
friendly
,
grown
independent
,
in
fact
,
has
the
ease
,
the
grace
of
*NL*
movement
of
a
trained
gymnast
each
of
whose
supple
limbs
will
carry
out
*NL*
precisely
the
movement
that
is
required
without
any
clumsy
participation
*NL*
by
the
rest
of
his
body
.
The
simple
and
elementary
gestures
used
by
a
*NL*
man
of
the
world
when
he
courteously
holds
out
his
hand
to
the
unknown
*NL*
youth
who
is
being
introduced
to
him
,
and
when
he
bows
discreetly
before
*NL*
the
Ambassador
to
whom
he
is
being
introduced
,
had
gradually
pervaded
,
*NL*
without
his
being
conscious
of
it
,
the
whole
of
Swann
's
social
*NL*
deportment
,
so
that
in
the
company
of
people
of
a
lower
grade
than
his
*NL*
own
,
such
as
the
Verdurins
and
their
friends
,
he
instinctively
shewed
an
*NL*
assiduity
,
and
made
overtures
with
which
,
by
their
account
,
any
of
their
*NL*
`
bores
'
would
have
dispensed
.
He
chilled
,
though
for
a
moment
only
,
*NL*
on
meeting
Dr.
Cottard
;
for
seeing
him
close
one
eye
with
an
ambiguous
*NL*
smile
,
before
they
had
yet
spoken
to
one
another
-LRB-
a
grimace
which
*NL*
Cottard
styled
``
letting
'em
all
come
''
-RRB-
,
Swann
supposed
that
the
Doctor
*NL*
recognised
him
from
having
met
him
already
somewhere
,
probably
in
some
*NL*
house
of
`
ill-fame
,
'
though
these
he
himself
very
rarely
visited
,
*NL*
never
having
made
a
habit
of
indulging
in
the
mercenary
sort
of
love
.
*NL*
Regarding
such
an
allusion
as
in
bad
taste
,
especially
before
Odette
,
*NL*
whose
opinion
of
himself
it
might
easily
alter
for
the
worse
,
Swann
*NL*
assumed
his
most
icy
manner
.
But
when
he
learned
that
the
lady
next
to
*NL*
the
Doctor
was
Mme.
Cottard
,
he
decided
that
so
young
a
husband
would
*NL*
not
deliberately
,
in
his
wife
's
hearing
,
have
made
any
allusion
to
*NL*
amusements
of
that
order
,
and
so
ceased
to
interpret
the
Doctor
's
*NL*
expression
in
the
sense
which
he
had
at
first
suspected
.
The
painter
at
*NL*
once
invited
Swann
to
visit
his
studio
with
Odette
,
and
Swann
found
him
*NL*
very
pleasant
.
``
Perhaps
you
will
be
more
highly
favoured
than
I
have
*NL*
been
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
broke
in
,
with
mock
resentment
of
the
favour
,
*NL*
``
perhaps
you
will
be
allowed
to
see
Cottard
's
portrait
''
-LRB-
for
which
she
*NL*
had
given
the
painter
a
commission
-RRB-
.
``
Take
care
,
Master
Biche
,
''
she
*NL*
reminded
the
painter
,
whom
it
was
a
time-honoured
pleasantry
to
address
*NL*
as
`
Master
,
'
``
to
catch
that
nice
look
in
his
eyes
,
that
witty
little
*NL*
twinkle
.
You
know
,
what
I
want
to
have
most
of
all
is
his
smile
;
that
's
*NL*
what
I
've
asked
you
to
paint
--
the
portrait
of
his
smile
.
''
And
since
the
*NL*
phrase
struck
her
as
noteworthy
,
she
repeated
it
very
loud
,
so
as
to
*NL*
make
sure
that
as
many
as
possible
of
her
guests
should
hear
it
,
and
*NL*
even
made
use
of
some
indefinite
pretext
to
draw
the
circle
closer
*NL*
before
she
uttered
it
again
.
Swann
begged
to
be
introduced
to
everyone
,
*NL*
even
to
an
old
friend
of
the
Verdurins
,
called
Saniette
,
whose
shyness
,
*NL*
simplicity
and
good-nature
had
deprived
him
of
all
the
consideration
due
*NL*
to
his
skill
in
palaeography
,
his
large
fortune
,
and
the
distinguished
*NL*
family
to
which
he
belonged
.
When
he
spoke
,
his
words
came
with
*NL*
a
confusion
which
was
delightful
to
hear
because
one
felt
that
it
*NL*
indicated
not
so
much
a
defect
in
his
speech
as
a
quality
of
his
soul
,
*NL*
as
it
were
a
survival
from
the
age
of
innocence
which
he
had
never
*NL*
wholly
outgrown
.
All
the
consonants
which
he
did
not
manage
to
pronounce
*NL*
seemed
like
harsh
utterances
of
which
his
gentle
lips
were
incapable
.
By
*NL*
asking
to
be
made
known
to
M.
Saniette
,
Swann
made
M.
Verdurin
reverse
*NL*
the
usual
form
of
introduction
-LRB-
saying
,
in
fact
,
with
emphasis
on
the
*NL*
distinction
:
``
M.
Swann
,
pray
let
me
present
to
you
our
friend
Saniette
''
-RRB-
*NL*
but
he
aroused
in
Saniette
himself
a
warmth
of
gratitude
,
which
,
*NL*
however
,
the
Verdurins
never
disclosed
to
Swann
,
since
Saniette
rather
*NL*
annoyed
them
,
and
they
did
not
feel
bound
to
provide
him
with
friends
.
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
the
Verdurins
were
extremely
touched
by
Swann
's
next
*NL*
request
,
for
he
felt
that
he
must
ask
to
be
introduced
to
the
pianist
's
*NL*
aunt
.
She
wore
a
black
dress
,
as
was
her
invariable
custom
,
for
she
*NL*
believed
that
a
woman
always
looked
well
in
black
,
and
that
nothing
*NL*
could
be
more
distinguished
;
but
her
face
was
exceedingly
red
,
as
*NL*
it
always
was
for
some
time
after
a
meal
.
She
bowed
to
Swann
with
*NL*
deference
,
but
drew
herself
up
again
with
great
dignity
.
As
she
was
*NL*
entirely
uneducated
,
and
was
afraid
of
making
mistakes
in
grammar
and
*NL*
pronunciation
,
she
used
purposely
to
speak
in
an
indistinct
and
garbling
*NL*
manner
,
thinking
that
if
she
should
make
a
slip
it
would
be
so
buried
in
*NL*
the
surrounding
confusion
that
no
one
could
be
certain
whether
she
had
*NL*
actually
made
it
or
not
;
with
the
result
that
her
talk
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
continuous
,
blurred
expectoration
,
out
of
which
would
emerge
,
at
rare
*NL*
intervals
,
those
sounds
and
syllables
of
which
she
felt
positive
.
*NL*
Swann
supposed
himself
entitled
to
poke
a
little
mild
fun
at
her
in
*NL*
conversation
with
M.
Verdurin
,
who
,
however
,
was
not
at
all
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
such
an
excellent
woman
!
''
he
rejoined
.
``
I
grant
you
that
she
*NL*
is
not
exactly
brilliant
;
but
I
assure
you
that
she
can
talk
most
*NL*
charmingly
when
you
are
alone
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
she
can
,
''
Swann
hastened
to
conciliate
him
.
``
All
I
meant
was
*NL*
that
she
hardly
struck
me
as
`
distinguished
,
'
''
he
went
on
,
isolating
*NL*
the
epithet
in
the
inverted
commas
of
his
tone
,
``
and
,
after
all
,
that
is
*NL*
something
of
a
compliment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
moment
,
''
said
M.
Verdurin
,
``
now
,
this
will
surprise
you
;
she
*NL*
writes
quite
delightfully
.
You
have
never
heard
her
nephew
play
?
It
is
*NL*
admirable
;
eh
,
Doctor
?
Would
you
like
me
to
ask
him
to
play
something
,
*NL*
M.
Swann
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
count
myself
most
fortunate
...
''
Swann
was
beginning
,
a
trifle
*NL*
pompously
,
when
the
Doctor
broke
in
derisively
.
Having
once
heard
it
*NL*
said
,
and
never
having
forgotten
that
in
general
conversation
emphasis
*NL*
and
the
use
of
formal
expressions
were
out
of
date
,
whenever
he
heard
a
*NL*
solemn
word
used
seriously
,
as
the
word
`
fortunate
'
had
been
used
just
*NL*
now
by
Swann
,
he
at
once
assumed
that
the
speaker
was
being
deliberately
*NL*
pedantic
.
And
if
,
moreover
,
the
same
word
happened
to
occur
,
also
,
in
*NL*
what
he
called
an
old
`
tag
'
or
`
saw
,
'
however
common
it
might
still
be
*NL*
in
current
usage
,
the
Doctor
jumped
to
the
conclusion
that
the
whole
*NL*
thing
was
a
joke
,
and
interrupted
with
the
remaining
words
of
the
*NL*
quotation
,
which
he
seemed
to
charge
the
speaker
with
having
intended
*NL*
to
introduce
at
that
point
,
although
in
reality
it
had
never
entered
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
fortunate
for
France
!
''
he
recited
wickedly
,
shooting
up
both
arms
*NL*
with
great
vigour
.
M.
Verdurin
could
not
help
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
all
those
good
people
laughing
at
over
there
?
There
's
no
sign
*NL*
of
brooding
melancholy
down
in
your
corner
,
''
shouted
Mme.
Verdurin
.
``
You
*NL*
do
n't
suppose
I
find
it
very
amusing
to
be
stuck
up
here
by
myself
on
*NL*
the
stool
of
repentance
,
''
she
went
on
peevishly
,
like
a
spoiled
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
was
sitting
upon
a
high
Swedish
chair
of
waxed
pine-wood
,
*NL*
which
a
violinist
from
that
country
had
given
her
,
and
which
she
kept
in
*NL*
her
drawing-room
,
although
in
appearance
it
suggested
a
school
`
form
,
'
*NL*
and
`
swore
,
'
as
the
saying
is
,
at
the
really
good
antique
furniture
*NL*
which
she
had
besides
;
but
she
made
a
point
of
keeping
on
view
the
*NL*
presents
which
her
`
faithful
'
were
in
the
habit
of
making
her
from
time
*NL*
to
time
,
so
that
the
donors
might
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
there
*NL*
when
they
came
to
the
house
.
She
tried
to
persuade
them
to
confine
*NL*
their
tributes
to
flowers
and
sweets
,
which
had
at
least
the
merit
of
*NL*
mortality
;
but
she
was
never
successful
,
and
the
house
was
gradually
*NL*
filled
with
a
collection
of
foot-warmers
,
cushions
,
clocks
,
screens
,
*NL*
barometers
and
vases
,
a
constant
repetition
and
a
boundless
incongruity
*NL*
of
useless
but
indestructible
objects
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
lofty
perch
she
would
take
her
spirited
part
in
the
*NL*
conversation
of
the
`
faithful
,
'
and
would
revel
in
all
their
fun
;
but
,
*NL*
since
the
accident
to
her
jaw
,
she
had
abandoned
the
effort
involved
in
*NL*
real
hilarity
,
and
had
substituted
a
kind
of
symbolical
dumb-show
which
*NL*
signified
,
without
endangering
or
even
fatiguing
her
in
any
way
,
that
*NL*
she
was
`
laughing
until
she
cried
.
'
At
the
least
witticism
aimed
by
any
*NL*
of
the
circle
against
a
`
bore
,
'
or
against
a
former
member
of
the
circle
*NL*
who
was
now
relegated
to
the
limbo
of
`
bores
'
--
and
to
the
utter
despair
*NL*
of
M.
Verdurin
,
who
had
always
made
out
that
he
was
just
as
easily
*NL*
amused
as
his
wife
,
but
who
,
since
his
laughter
was
the
`
real
thing
,
'
*NL*
was
out
of
breath
in
a
moment
,
and
so
was
overtaken
and
vanquished
*NL*
by
her
device
of
a
feigned
but
continuous
hilarity
--
she
would
utter
a
*NL*
shrill
cry
,
shut
tight
her
little
bird-like
eyes
,
which
were
beginning
*NL*
to
be
clouded
over
by
a
cataract
,
and
quickly
,
as
though
she
had
only
*NL*
just
time
to
avoid
some
indecent
sight
or
to
parry
a
mortal
blow
,
*NL*
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
,
which
completely
engulfed
it
,
and
*NL*
prevented
her
from
seeing
anything
at
all
,
she
would
appear
to
be
*NL*
struggling
to
suppress
,
to
eradicate
a
laugh
which
,
were
she
to
give
*NL*
way
to
it
,
must
inevitably
leave
her
inanimate
.
So
,
stupefied
with
*NL*
the
gaiety
of
the
`
faithful
,
'
drunken
with
comradeship
,
scandal
and
*NL*
asseveration
,
Mme.
Verdurin
,
perched
on
her
high
seat
like
a
cage-bird
*NL*
whose
biscuit
has
been
steeped
in
mulled
wine
,
would
sit
aloft
and
sob
*NL*
with
fellow-feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
M.
Verdurin
,
after
first
asking
Swann
's
permission
to
light
*NL*
his
pipe
-LRB-
``
No
ceremony
here
,
you
understand
;
we
're
all
pals
!
''
-RRB-
,
went
and
*NL*
begged
the
young
musician
to
sit
down
at
the
piano
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
him
alone
;
do
n't
bother
him
;
he
has
n't
come
here
to
be
*NL*
tormented
,
''
cried
Mme.
Verdurin
.
``
I
wo
n't
have
him
tormented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
on
earth
should
it
bother
him
?
''
rejoined
M.
Verdurin
.
``
I
'm
sure
*NL*
M.
Swann
has
never
heard
the
sonata
in
F
sharp
which
we
discovered
;
he
*NL*
is
going
to
play
us
the
pianoforte
arrangement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
not
my
sonata
!
''
she
screamed
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
be
made
to
*NL*
cry
until
I
get
a
cold
in
the
head
,
and
neuralgia
all
down
my
face
,
like
*NL*
last
time
;
thanks
very
much
,
I
do
n't
intend
to
repeat
that
performance
;
*NL*
you
are
all
very
kind
and
considerate
;
it
is
easy
to
see
that
none
of
*NL*
you
will
have
to
stay
in
bed
,
for
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
scene
,
which
was
re-enacted
as
often
as
the
young
pianist
*NL*
sat
down
to
play
,
never
failed
to
delight
the
audience
,
as
though
*NL*
each
of
them
were
witnessing
it
for
the
first
time
,
as
a
proof
of
the
*NL*
seductive
originality
of
the
`
Mistress
'
as
she
was
styled
,
and
of
the
*NL*
acute
sensitiveness
of
her
musical
`
ear
.
'
Those
nearest
to
her
would
*NL*
attract
the
attention
of
the
rest
,
who
were
smoking
or
playing
cards
at
*NL*
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
by
their
cries
of
`
Hear
,
hear
!
'
which
,
as
*NL*
in
Parliamentary
debates
,
shewed
that
something
worth
listening
to
was
*NL*
being
said
.
And
next
day
they
would
commiserate
with
those
who
had
*NL*
been
prevented
from
coming
that
evening
,
and
would
assure
them
that
the
*NL*
`
little
scene
'
had
never
been
so
amusingly
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
right
,
then
,
''
said
M.
Verdurin
,
``
he
can
play
just
the
*NL*
andante
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
the
_
andante
_
!
How
you
do
go
on
,
''
cried
his
wife
.
``
As
if
it
*NL*
were
n't
`
just
the
_
andante
_
'
that
breaks
every
bone
in
my
body
.
The
*NL*
`
Master
'
is
really
too
priceless
!
Just
as
though
,
`
in
the
Ninth
,
'
he
*NL*
said
`
we
need
only
have
the
_
finale
_
,
'
or
`
just
the
overture
'
of
the
*NL*
_
Meistersinger
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Doctor
,
however
,
urged
Mme.
Verdurin
to
let
the
pianist
play
,
*NL*
not
because
he
supposed
her
to
be
malingering
when
she
spoke
of
the
*NL*
distressing
effects
that
music
always
had
upon
her
,
for
he
recognised
*NL*
the
existence
of
certain
neurasthenic
states
--
but
from
his
habit
,
common
*NL*
to
many
doctors
,
of
at
once
relaxing
the
strict
letter
of
a
prescription
*NL*
as
soon
as
it
appeared
to
jeopardise
,
what
seemed
to
him
far
more
*NL*
important
,
the
success
of
some
social
gathering
at
which
he
was
present
,
*NL*
and
of
which
the
patient
whom
he
had
urged
for
once
to
forget
her
*NL*
dyspepsia
or
headache
formed
an
essential
factor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
be
ill
this
time
,
you
'll
find
,
''
he
told
her
,
seeking
at
the
*NL*
same
time
to
subdue
her
mind
by
the
magnetism
of
his
gaze
.
``
And
,
if
you
*NL*
are
ill
,
we
will
cure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
,
really
?
''
Mme.
Verdurin
spoke
as
though
,
with
so
great
a
*NL*
favour
in
store
for
her
,
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
capitulate
.
*NL*
Perhaps
,
too
,
by
dint
of
saying
that
she
was
going
to
be
ill
,
she
had
*NL*
worked
herself
into
a
state
in
which
she
forgot
,
occasionally
,
that
it
*NL*
was
all
only
a
`
little
scene
,
'
and
regarded
things
,
quite
sincerely
,
*NL*
from
an
invalid
's
point
of
view
.
For
it
may
often
be
remarked
that
*NL*
invalids
grow
weary
of
having
the
frequency
of
their
attacks
depend
*NL*
always
on
their
own
prudence
in
avoiding
them
,
and
like
to
let
*NL*
themselves
think
that
they
are
free
to
do
everything
that
they
most
*NL*
enjoy
doing
,
although
they
are
always
ill
after
doing
it
,
provided
only
*NL*
that
they
place
themselves
in
the
hands
of
a
higher
authority
which
,
*NL*
without
putting
them
to
the
least
inconvenience
,
can
and
will
,
by
*NL*
uttering
a
word
or
by
administering
a
tabloid
,
set
them
once
again
upon
*NL*
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Odette
had
gone
to
sit
on
a
tapestry-covered
sofa
near
the
piano
,
saying
*NL*
to
Mme.
Verdurin
,
``
I
have
my
own
little
corner
,
have
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mme.
Verdurin
,
seeing
Swann
by
himself
upon
a
chair
,
made
him
get
*NL*
up
.
``
You
're
not
at
all
comfortable
there
;
go
along
and
sit
by
Odette
;
*NL*
you
can
make
room
for
M.
Swann
there
,
ca
n't
you
,
Odette
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
charming
Beauvais
!
''
said
Swann
,
stopping
to
admire
the
sofa
before
*NL*
he
sat
down
on
it
,
and
wishing
to
be
polite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
appreciate
my
sofa
,
''
replied
Mme.
Verdurin
,
``
and
I
warn
*NL*
you
that
if
you
expect
ever
to
see
another
like
it
you
may
as
well
*NL*
abandon
the
idea
at
once
.
They
never
made
any
more
like
it
.
And
these
*NL*
little
chairs
,
too
,
are
perfect
marvels
.
You
can
look
at
them
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
The
emblems
in
each
of
the
bronze
mouldings
correspond
to
the
*NL*
subject
of
the
tapestry
on
the
chair
;
you
know
,
you
combine
amusement
*NL*
with
instruction
when
you
look
at
them
;
--
I
can
promise
you
a
delightful
*NL*
time
,
I
assure
you
.
Just
look
at
the
little
border
around
the
edges
;
*NL*
here
,
look
,
the
little
vine
on
a
red
background
in
this
one
,
the
Bear
*NL*
and
the
Grapes
.
Is
n't
it
well
drawn
?
What
do
you
say
?
I
think
they
knew
*NL*
a
thing
or
two
about
design
!
Does
n't
it
make
your
mouth
water
,
this
*NL*
vine
?
My
husband
makes
out
that
I
am
not
fond
of
fruit
,
because
I
eat
*NL*
less
than
he
does
.
But
not
a
bit
of
it
,
I
am
greedier
than
any
of
you
,
*NL*
but
I
have
no
need
to
fill
my
mouth
with
them
when
I
can
feed
on
them
*NL*
with
my
eyes
.
What
are
you
all
laughing
at
now
,
pray
?
Ask
the
Doctor
;
*NL*
he
will
tell
you
that
those
grapes
act
on
me
like
a
regular
purge
.
Some
*NL*
people
go
to
Fontainebleau
for
cures
;
I
take
my
own
little
Beauvais
cure
*NL*
here
.
But
,
M.
Swann
,
you
must
n't
run
away
without
feeling
the
little
*NL*
bronze
mouldings
on
the
backs
.
Is
n't
it
an
exquisite
surface
?
No
,
no
,
*NL*
not
with
your
whole
hand
like
that
;
feel
them
properly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Mme.
Verdurin
is
going
to
start
playing
about
with
her
bronzes
,
''
*NL*
said
the
painter
,
``
we
sha
n't
get
any
music
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
,
you
wretch
!
And
yet
we
poor
women

she
went
on
,
``
are

forbidden
pleasures
far
less
voluptuous
than
this

There
is
no
flesh
in
*NL*
the
world
as
soft
as
these
.
None

When
M.
Verdurin
did
me
the
honour
*NL*
of
being
madly
jealous
...
come
,
you
might
at

be
polite

Do

been
jealous

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my

I
have
said
absolutely
nothing

Look
here

Doctor

I
call
*NL*
you

a
witness
;
did
I
utter
a
word
?

*NL*
*NL*
Swann
had
begun
,
out
of
politeness
,
to
finger
the
bronzes
,
and
did
not
*NL*
like
to
stop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along

you
can
caress
them

you

caressed
in

you
'll
like

I
think

Here
's
the
*NL*
young
gentleman
who
will
take
charge

*NL*
*NL*
After
the
pianist
had
played
,
Swann
felt
and
shewed
more
interest
in
him
*NL*
than
in
any
of
the
other
guests
,
for
the
following
reason
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
year
before
,
at
an
evening
party
,
he
had
heard
a
piece
of
music
*NL*
played
on
the
piano
and
violin
.
At
first
he
had
appreciated
only
the
*NL*
material
quality
of
the
sounds
which
those
instruments
secreted
.
And
it
*NL*
had
been
a
source
of
keen
pleasure
when
,
below
the
narrow
ribbon
of
the
*NL*
violin-part
,
delicate
,
unyielding
,
substantial
and
governing
the
whole
,
*NL*
he
had
suddenly
perceived
,
where
it
was
trying
to
surge
upwards
in
a
*NL*
flowing
tide
of
sound
,
the
mass
of
the
piano-part
,
multiform
,
coherent
,
*NL*
level
,
and
breaking
everywhere
in
melody
like
the
deep
blue
tumult
of
*NL*
the
sea
,
silvered
and
charmed
into
a
minor
key
by
the
moonlight
.
But
at
*NL*
a
given
moment
,
without
being
able
to
distinguish
any
clear
outline
,
*NL*
or
to
give
a
name
to
what
was
pleasing
him
,
suddenly
enraptured
,
he
had
*NL*
tried
to
collect
,
to
treasure
in
his
memory
the
phrase
or
harmony
--
he
*NL*
knew
not
which
--
that
had
just
been
played
,
and
had
opened
and
expanded
*NL*
his
soul
,
just
as
the
fragrance
of
certain
roses
,
wafted
upon
the
moist
*NL*
air
of
evening
,
has
the
power
of
dilating
our
nostrils
.
Perhaps
it
was
*NL*
owing
to
his
own
ignorance
of
music
that
he
had
been
able
to
receive
so
*NL*
confused
an
impression
,
one
of
those
that
are
,
notwithstanding
,
our
only
*NL*
purely
musical
impressions
,
limited
in
their
extent
,
entirely
original
,
*NL*
and
irreducible
into
any
other
kind
.
An
impression
of
this
order
,
*NL*
vanishing
in
an
instant
,
is
,
so
to
speak
,
an
impression
_
sine
materia
_
.
*NL*
Presumably
the
notes
which
we
hear
at
such
moments
tend
to
spread
out
*NL*
before
our
eyes
,
over
surfaces
greater
or
smaller
according
to
their
*NL*
pitch
and
volume
;
to
trace
arabesque
designs
,
to
give
us
the
sensation
*NL*
of
breadth
or
tenuity
,
stability
or
caprice
.
But
the
notes
themselves
*NL*
have
vanished
before
these
sensations
have
developed
sufficiently
to
*NL*
escape
submersion
under
those
which
the
following
,
or
even
simultaneous
*NL*
notes
have
already
begun
to
awaken
in
us
.
And
this
indefinite
perception
*NL*
would
continue
to
smother
in
its
molten
liquidity
the
_
motifs
_
which
now
*NL*
and
then
emerge
,
barely
discernible
,
to
plunge
again
and
disappear
and
*NL*
drown
;
recognised
only
by
the
particular
kind
of
pleasure
which
they
*NL*
instil
,
impossible
to
describe
,
to
recollect
,
to
name
;
ineffable
;
--
if
*NL*
our
memory
,
like
a
labourer
who
toils
at
the
laying
down
of
firm
*NL*
foundations
beneath
the
tumult
of
the
waves
,
did
not
,
by
fashioning
for
*NL*
us
facsimiles
of
those
fugitive
phrases
,
enable
us
to
compare
and
to
*NL*
contrast
them
with
those
that
follow
.
And
so
,
hardly
had
the
delicious
*NL*
sensation
,
which
Swann
had
experienced
,
died
away
,
before
his
memory
*NL*
had
furnished
him
with
an
immediate
transcript
,
summary
,
it
is
true
,
*NL*
and
provisional
,
but
one
on
which
he
had
kept
his
eyes
fixed
while
*NL*
the
playing
continued
,
so
effectively
that
,
when
the
same
impression
*NL*
suddenly
returned
,
it
was
no
longer
uncapturable
.
He
was
able
to
picture
*NL*
to
himself
its
extent
,
its
symmetrical
arrangement
,
its
notation
,
the
*NL*
strength
of
its
expression
;
he
had
before
him
that
definite
object
which
*NL*
was
no
longer
pure
music
,
but
rather
design
,
architecture
,
thought
,
*NL*
and
which
allowed
the
actual
music
to
be
recalled
.
This
time
he
had
*NL*
distinguished
,
quite
clearly
,
a
phrase
which
emerged
for
a
few
moments
*NL*
from
the
waves
of
sound
.
It
had
at
once
held
out
to
him
an
invitation
to
*NL*
partake
of
intimate
pleasures
,
of
whose
existence
,
before
hearing
it
,
he
*NL*
had
never
dreamed
,
into
which
he
felt
that
nothing
but
this
phrase
could
*NL*
initiate
him
;
and
he
had
been
filled
with
love
for
it
,
as
with
a
new
and
*NL*
strange
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
slow
and
rhythmical
movement
it
led
him
here
,
there
,
everywhere
,
*NL*
towards
a
state
of
happiness
noble
,
unintelligible
,
yet
clearly
*NL*
indicated
.
And
then
,
suddenly
having
reached
a
certain
point
from
which
*NL*
he
was
prepared
to
follow
it
,
after
pausing
for
a
moment
,
abruptly
it
*NL*
changed
its
direction
,
and
in
a
fresh
movement
,
more
rapid
,
multiform
,
*NL*
melancholy
,
incessant
,
sweet
,
it
bore
him
off
with
it
towards
a
vista
*NL*
of
joys
unknown
.
Then
it
vanished
.
He
hoped
,
with
a
passionate
longing
,
*NL*
that
he
might
find
it
again
,
a
third
time
.
And
reappear
it
did
,
though
*NL*
without
speaking
to
him
more
clearly
,
bringing
him
,
indeed
,
a
pleasure
*NL*
less
profound
.
But
when
he
was
once
more
at
home
he
needed
it
,
he
*NL*
was
like
a
man
into
whose
life
a
woman
,
whom
he
has
seen
for
a
moment
*NL*
passing
by
,
has
brought
a
new
form
of
beauty
,
which
strengthens
and
*NL*
enlarges
his
own
power
of
perception
,
without
his
knowing
even
whether
*NL*
he
is
ever
to
see
her
again
whom
he
loves
already
,
although
he
knows
*NL*
nothing
of
her
,
not
even
her
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
this
passion
for
a
phrase
of
music
seemed
,
in
the
first
few
*NL*
months
,
to
be
bringing
into
Swann
's
life
the
possibility
of
a
sort
of
*NL*
rejuvenation
.
He
had
so
long
since
ceased
to
direct
his
course
towards
*NL*
any
ideal
goal
,
and
had
confined
himself
to
the
pursuit
of
ephemeral
*NL*
satisfactions
,
that
he
had
come
to
believe
,
though
without
ever
formally
*NL*
stating
his
belief
even
to
himself
,
that
he
would
remain
all
his
life
in
*NL*
that
condition
,
which
death
alone
could
alter
.
More
than
this
,
since
his
*NL*
mind
no
longer
entertained
any
lofty
ideals
,
he
had
ceased
to
believe
*NL*
in
-LRB-
although
he
could
not
have
expressly
denied
-RRB-
their
reality
.
He
had
*NL*
grown
also
into
the
habit
of
taking
refuge
in
trivial
considerations
,
*NL*
which
allowed
him
to
set
on
one
side
matters
of
fundamental
importance
.
*NL*
Just
as
he
had
never
stopped
to
ask
himself
whether
he
would
not
have
*NL*
done
better
by
not
going
into
society
,
knowing
very
well
that
if
he
*NL*
had
accepted
an
invitation
he
must
put
in
an
appearance
,
and
that
*NL*
afterwards
,
if
he
did
not
actually
call
,
he
must
at
least
leave
cards
*NL*
upon
his
hostess
;
so
in
his
conversation
he
took
care
never
to
express
*NL*
with
any
warmth
a
personal
opinion
about
a
thing
,
but
instead
would
*NL*
supply
facts
and
details
which
had
a
value
of
a
sort
in
themselves
,
and
*NL*
excused
him
from
shewing
how
much
he
really
knew
.
He
would
be
extremely
*NL*
precise
about
the
recipe
for
a
dish
,
the
dates
of
a
painter
's
birth
and
*NL*
death
,
and
the
titles
of
his
works
.
Sometimes
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
he
*NL*
would
let
himself
go
so
far
as
to
utter
a
criticism
of
a
work
of
art
,
or
*NL*
of
some
one
's
interpretation
of
life
,
but
then
he
would
cloak
his
words
*NL*
in
a
tone
of
irony
,
as
though
he
did
not
altogether
associate
himself
*NL*
with
what
he
was
saying
.
But
now
,
like
a
confirmed
invalid
whom
,
all
*NL*
of
a
sudden
,
a
change
of
air
and
surroundings
,
or
a
new
course
of
*NL*
treatment
,
or
,
as
sometimes
happens
,
an
organic
change
in
himself
,
*NL*
spontaneous
and
unaccountable
,
seems
to
have
so
far
recovered
from
his
*NL*
malady
that
he
begins
to
envisage
the
possibility
,
hitherto
beyond
*NL*
all
hope
,
of
starting
to
lead
--
and
better
late
than
never
--
a
wholly
*NL*
different
life
,
Swann
found
in
himself
,
in
the
memory
of
the
phrase
that
*NL*
he
had
heard
,
in
certain
other
sonatas
which
he
had
made
people
play
*NL*
over
to
him
,
to
see
whether
he
might
not
,
perhaps
,
discover
his
phrase
*NL*
among
them
,
the
presence
of
one
of
those
invisible
realities
in
which
*NL*
he
had
ceased
to
believe
,
but
to
which
,
as
though
the
music
had
had
upon
*NL*
the
moral
barrenness
from
which
he
was
suffering
a
sort
of
recreative
*NL*
influence
,
he
was
conscious
once
again
of
a
desire
,
almost
,
indeed
,
of
*NL*
the
power
to
consecrate
his
life
.
But
,
never
having
managed
to
find
out
*NL*
whose
work
it
was
that
he
had
heard
played
that
evening
,
he
had
been
*NL*
unable
to
procure
a
copy
,
and
finally
had
forgotten
the
quest
.
He
had
*NL*
indeed
,
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
,
encountered
several
of
the
*NL*
people
who
had
been
at
the
party
with
him
,
and
had
questioned
them
;
*NL*
but
most
of
them
had
either
arrived
after
or
left
before
the
piece
was
*NL*
played
;
some
had
indeed
been
in
the
house
,
but
had
gone
into
another
*NL*
room
to
talk
,
and
those
who
had
stayed
to
listen
had
no
clearer
*NL*
impression
than
the
rest
.
As
for
his
hosts
,
they
knew
that
it
was
a
*NL*
recently
published
work
which
the
musicians
whom
they
had
engaged
for
*NL*
the
evening
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
play
;
but
,
as
these
last
were
now
*NL*
on
tour
somewhere
,
Swann
could
learn
nothing
further
.
He
had
,
of
*NL*
course
,
a
number
of
musical
friends
,
but
,
vividly
as
he
could
recall
the
*NL*
exquisite
and
inexpressible
pleasure
which
the
little
phrase
had
given
*NL*
him
,
and
could
see
,
still
,
before
his
eyes
the
forms
that
it
had
traced
*NL*
in
outline
,
he
was
quite
incapable
of
humming
over
to
them
the
air
.
And
*NL*
so
,
at
last
,
he
ceased
to
think
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to-night
,
at
Mme.
Verdurin
's
,
scarcely
had
the
little
pianist
begun
*NL*
to
play
when
,
suddenly
,
after
a
high
note
held
on
through
two
whole
*NL*
bars
,
Swann
saw
it
approaching
,
stealing
forth
from
underneath
that
*NL*
resonance
,
which
was
prolonged
and
stretched
out
over
it
,
like
a
curtain
*NL*
of
sound
,
to
veil
the
mystery
of
its
birth
--
and
recognised
,
secret
,
*NL*
whispering
,
articulate
,
the
airy
and
fragrant
phrase
that
he
had
loved
.
*NL*
And
it
was
so
peculiarly
itself
,
it
had
so
personal
a
charm
,
which
*NL*
nothing
else
could
have
replaced
,
that
Swann
felt
as
though
he
had
met
,
*NL*
in
a
friend
's
drawing-room
,
a
woman
whom
he
had
seen
and
admired
,
once
,
*NL*
in
the
street
,
and
had
despaired
of
ever
seeing
her
again
.
Finally
the
*NL*
phrase
withdrew
and
vanished
,
pointing
,
directing
,
diligent
among
the
*NL*
wandering
currents
of
its
fragrance
,
leaving
upon
Swann
's
features
a
*NL*
reflection
of
its
smile
.
But
now
,
at
last
,
he
could
ask
the
name
of
*NL*
his
fair
unknown
-LRB-
and
was
told
that
it
was
the
_
andante
_
movement
of
*NL*
Vinteuil
's
sonata
for
the
piano
and
violin
-RRB-
,
he
held
it
safe
,
could
*NL*
have
it
again
to
himself
,
at
home
,
as
often
as
he
would
,
could
study
its
*NL*
language
and
acquire
its
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
when
the
pianist
had
finished
,
Swann
crossed
the
room
and
*NL*
thanked
him
with
a
vivacity
which
delighted
Mme.
Verdurin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
he
charming
?
''
she
asked
Swann
,
``
does
n't
he
just
understand
it
,
*NL*
his
sonata
,
the
little
wretch
?
You
never
dreamed
,
did
you
,
that
a
piano
*NL*
could
be
made
to
express
all
that
?
Upon
my
word
,
there
's
everything
in
*NL*
it
except
the
piano
!
I
'm
caught
out
every
time
I
hear
it
;
I
think
*NL*
I
'm
listening
to
an
orchestra
.
Though
it
's
better
,
really
,
than
an
*NL*
orchestra
,
more
complete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
pianist
bent
over
her
as
he
answered
,
smiling
and
underlining
*NL*
each
of
his
words
as
though
he
were
making
an
epigram
:
``
You
are
most
*NL*
generous
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
Mme.
Verdurin
was
saying
to
her
husband
,
``
Run
and
fetch
him
a
*NL*
glass
of
orangeade
;
it
's
well
earned
!
''
Swann
began
to
tell
Odette
how
he
*NL*
had
fallen
in
love
with
that
little
phrase
.
When
their
hostess
,
who
was
*NL*
a
little
way
off
,
called
out
,
``
Well
!
It
looks
to
me
as
though
some
one
*NL*
was
saying
nice
things
to
you
,
Odette
!
''
she
replied
,
``
Yes
,
very
*NL*
nice
,
''
and
he
found
her
simplicity
delightful
.
Then
he
asked
for
some
*NL*
information
about
this
Vinteuil
;
what
else
he
had
done
,
and
at
what
*NL*
period
in
his
life
he
had
composed
the
sonata
;
--
what
meaning
the
little
*NL*
phrase
could
have
had
for
him
,
that
was
what
Swann
wanted
most
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
none
of
these
people
who
professed
to
admire
this
musician
-LRB-
when
*NL*
Swann
had
said
that
the
sonata
was
really
charming
Mme.
Verdurin
had
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
I
quite
believe
it
!
Charming
,
indeed
!
But
you
do
n't
dare
to
*NL*
confess
that
you
do
n't
know
Vinteuil
's
sonata
;
you
have
no
right
not
to
*NL*
know
it
!
''
--
and
the
painter
had
gone
on
with
,
``
Ah
,
yes
,
it
's
a
very
fine
*NL*
bit
of
work
,
is
n't
it
?
Not
,
of
course
,
if
you
want
something
`
obvious
,
'
*NL*
something
`
popular
,
'
but
,
I
mean
to
say
,
it
makes
a
very
great
*NL*
impression
on
us
artists
.
''
-RRB-
,
none
of
them
seemed
ever
to
have
asked
*NL*
himself
these
questions
,
for
none
of
them
was
able
to
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
to
one
or
two
particular
remarks
made
by
Swann
on
his
favourite
*NL*
phrase
,
``
D'you
know
,
that
's
a
funny
thing
;
I
had
never
noticed
it
;
I
may
*NL*
as
well
tell
you
that
I
do
n't
much
care
about
peering
at
things
through
*NL*
a
microscope
,
and
pricking
myself
on
pin-points
of
difference
;
no
;
we
*NL*
do
n't
waste
time
splitting
hairs
in
this
house
;
why
not
?
well
,
it
's
not
*NL*
a
habit
of
ours
,
that
's
all
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
replied
,
while
Dr.
Cottard
*NL*
gazed
at
her
with
open-mouthed
admiration
,
and
yearned
to
be
able
to
*NL*
follow
her
as
she
skipped
lightly
from
one
stepping-stone
to
another
*NL*
of
her
stock
of
ready-made
phrases
.
Both
he
,
however
,
and
Mme.
Cottard
,
*NL*
with
a
kind
of
common
sense
which
is
shared
by
many
people
of
humble
*NL*
origin
,
would
always
take
care
not
to
express
an
opinion
,
or
to
pretend
*NL*
to
admire
a
piece
of
music
which
they
would
confess
to
each
other
,
once
*NL*
they
were
safely
at
home
,
that
they
no
more
understood
than
they
could
*NL*
understand
the
art
of
`
Master
'
Biche
.
Inasmuch
as
the
public
can
not
*NL*
recognise
the
charm
,
the
beauty
,
even
the
outlines
of
nature
save
in
the
*NL*
stereotyped
impressions
of
an
art
which
they
have
gradually
assimilated
,
*NL*
while
an
original
artist
starts
by
rejecting
those
impressions
,
so
*NL*
M.
and
Mme.
Cottard
,
typical
,
in
this
respect
,
of
the
public
,
were
*NL*
incapable
of
finding
,
either
in
Vinteuil
's
sonata
or
in
Biche
's
*NL*
portraits
,
what
constituted
harmony
,
for
them
,
in
music
or
beauty
in
*NL*
painting
.
It
appeared
to
them
,
when
the
pianist
played
his
sonata
,
as
*NL*
though
he
were
striking
haphazard
from
the
piano
a
medley
of
notes
which
*NL*
bore
no
relation
to
the
musical
forms
to
which
they
themselves
were
*NL*
accustomed
,
and
that
the
painter
simply
flung
the
colours
haphazard
upon
*NL*
his
canvas
.
When
,
on
one
of
these
,
they
were
able
to
distinguish
a
human
*NL*
form
,
they
always
found
it
coarsened
and
vulgarised
-LRB-
that
is
to
say
*NL*
lacking
all
the
elegance
of
the
school
of
painting
through
whose
*NL*
spectacles
they
themselves
were
in
the
habit
of
seeing
the
people
--
real
,
*NL*
living
people
,
who
passed
them
in
the
streets
-RRB-
and
devoid
of
truth
,
as
*NL*
though
M.
Biche
had
not
known
how
the
human
shoulder
was
constructed
,
or
*NL*
that
a
woman
's
hair
was
not
,
ordinarily
,
purple
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
when
the
`
faithful
'
were
scattered
out
of
earshot
,
the
Doctor
*NL*
felt
that
the
opportunity
was
too
good
to
be
missed
,
and
so
-LRB-
while
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
was
adding
a
final
word
of
commendation
of
Vinteuil
's
sonata
-RRB-
*NL*
like
a
would-be
swimmer
who
jumps
into
the
water
,
so
as
to
learn
,
but
*NL*
chooses
a
moment
when
there
are
not
too
many
people
looking
on
:
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
;
he
's
what
they
call
a
musician
_
di
primo
cartello
_
!
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
with
a
sudden
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
discovered
no
more
than
that
the
recent
publication
of
Vinteuil
's
*NL*
sonata
had
caused
a
great
stir
among
the
most
advanced
school
of
*NL*
musicians
,
but
that
it
was
still
unknown
to
the
general
public
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
some
one
,
quite
well
,
called
Vinteuil
,
''
said
Swann
,
thinking
of
*NL*
the
old
music-master
at
Combray
who
had
taught
my
grandmother
's
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
that
's
the
man
!
''
cried
Mme.
Verdurin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
!
''
Swann
burst
out
laughing
.
``
If
you
had
ever
seen
him
for
a
*NL*
moment
you
would
n't
put
the
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
to
put
the
question
is
to
solve
the
problem
?
''
the
Doctor
*NL*
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
may
well
be
some
relative
,
''
Swann
went
on
.
``
That
would
be
bad
*NL*
enough
;
but
,
after
all
,
there
is
no
reason
why
a
genius
should
n't
have
*NL*
a
cousin
who
is
a
silly
old
fool
.
And
if
that
should
be
so
,
I
swear
*NL*
there
's
no
known
or
unknown
form
of
torture
I
would
n't
undergo
to
*NL*
get
the
old
fool
to
introduce
me
to
the
man
who
composed
the
sonata
;
*NL*
starting
with
the
torture
of
the
old
fool
's
company
,
which
would
be
*NL*
ghastly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
understood
that
Vinteuil
was
seriously
ill
at
the
moment
,
*NL*
and
that
Dr.
Potain
despaired
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
Mme.
Verdurin
,
``
Do
people
still
call
in
Potain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Mme.
Verdurin
,
''
Cottard
simpered
,
``
you
forget
that
you
are
speaking
*NL*
of
one
of
my
colleagues
--
I
should
say
,
one
of
my
masters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
had
heard
,
somewhere
,
that
Vinteuil
was
threatened
with
the
*NL*
loss
of
his
reason
.
And
he
insisted
that
signs
of
this
could
be
detected
*NL*
in
certain
passages
in
the
sonata
.
This
remark
did
not
strike
Swann
as
*NL*
ridiculous
;
rather
,
it
puzzled
him
.
For
,
since
a
purely
musical
work
*NL*
contains
none
of
those
logical
sequences
,
the
interruption
or
confusion
*NL*
of
which
,
in
spoken
or
written
language
,
is
a
proof
of
insanity
,
so
*NL*
insanity
diagnosed
in
a
sonata
seemed
to
him
as
mysterious
a
thing
as
*NL*
the
insanity
of
a
dog
or
a
horse
,
although
instances
may
be
observed
of
*NL*
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
speak
to
me
about
`
your
masters
'
;
you
know
ten
times
as
much
as
*NL*
he
does
!
''
Mme.
Verdurin
answered
Dr.
Cottard
,
in
the
tone
of
a
woman
who
*NL*
has
the
courage
of
her
convictions
,
and
is
quite
ready
to
stand
up
to
*NL*
anyone
who
disagrees
with
her
.
``
Anyhow
,
you
do
n't
kill
your
patients
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Madame
,
he
is
in
the
Academy
.
''
The
Doctor
smiled
with
bitter
*NL*
irony
.
``
If
a
sick
person
prefers
to
die
at
the
hands
of
one
of
the
*NL*
Princes
of
Science
...
It
is
far
more
smart
to
be
able
to
say
,
`
Yes
,
I
*NL*
have
Potain
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
More
smart
,
is
it
?
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
.
``
So
there
are
*NL*
fashions
,
nowadays
,
in
illness
,
are
there
?
I
did
n't
know
that
...
Oh
,
*NL*
you
do
make
me
laugh
!
''
she
screamed
,
suddenly
,
burying
her
face
in
her
*NL*
hands
.
``
And
here
was
I
,
poor
thing
,
talking
quite
seriously
,
and
never
*NL*
seeing
that
you
were
pulling
my
leg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
M.
Verdurin
,
finding
it
rather
a
strain
to
start
laughing
again
*NL*
over
so
small
a
matter
,
he
was
content
with
puffing
out
a
cloud
of
smoke
*NL*
from
his
pipe
,
while
he
reflected
sadly
that
he
could
never
again
hope
*NL*
to
keep
pace
with
his
wife
in
her
Atalanta-flights
across
the
field
of
*NL*
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'you
know
;
we
like
your
friend
so
very
much
,
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
,
*NL*
later
,
when
Odette
was
bidding
her
good
night
.
``
He
is
so
unaffected
,
*NL*
quite
charming
.
If
they
're
all
like
that
,
the
friends
you
want
to
bring
*NL*
here
,
by
all
means
bring
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Verdurin
remarked
that
Swann
had
failed
,
all
the
same
,
to
appreciate
*NL*
the
pianist
's
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
he
felt
a
little
strange
,
poor
man
,
''
suggested
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
.
``
You
ca
n't
expect
him
to
catch
the
tone
of
the
house
the
first
*NL*
time
he
comes
;
like
Cottard
,
who
has
been
one
of
our
little
`
clan
'
now
*NL*
for
years
.
The
first
time
does
n't
count
;
it
's
just
for
looking
round
and
*NL*
finding
out
things
.
Odette
,
he
understands
all
right
,
he
's
to
join
us
*NL*
to-morrow
at
the
Châtelet
.
Perhaps
you
might
call
for
him
and
bring
*NL*
him
.
''
``
No
,
he
does
n't
want
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
;
just
as
you
like
.
Provided
he
does
n't
fail
us
at
the
*NL*
last
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Greatly
to
Mme.
Verdurin
's
surprise
,
he
never
failed
them
.
He
would
go
*NL*
to
meet
them
,
no
matter
where
,
at
restaurants
outside
Paris
-LRB-
not
that
*NL*
they
went
there
much
at
first
,
for
the
season
had
not
yet
begun
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
more
frequently
at
the
play
,
in
which
Mme.
Verdurin
delighted
.
One
*NL*
evening
,
when
they
were
dining
at
home
,
he
heard
her
complain
that
she
*NL*
had
not
one
of
those
permits
which
would
save
her
the
trouble
of
waiting
*NL*
at
doors
and
standing
in
crowds
,
and
say
how
useful
it
would
be
to
them
*NL*
at
first-nights
,
and
gala
performances
at
the
Opera
,
and
what
a
nuisance
*NL*
it
had
been
,
not
having
one
,
on
the
day
of
Gambetta
's
funeral
.
Swann
*NL*
never
spoke
of
his
distinguished
friends
,
but
only
of
such
as
might
be
*NL*
regarded
as
detrimental
,
whom
,
therefore
,
he
thought
it
snobbish
,
and
*NL*
in
not
very
good
taste
to
conceal
;
while
he
frequented
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Germain
he
had
come
to
include
,
in
the
latter
class
,
all
his
*NL*
friends
in
the
official
world
of
the
Third
Republic
,
and
so
broke
in
,
*NL*
without
thinking
:
``
I
'll
see
to
that
,
all
right
.
You
shall
have
it
in
*NL*
time
for
the
_
Danicheff
_
revival
.
I
shall
be
lunching
with
the
Prefect
*NL*
of
Police
to-morrow
,
as
it
happens
,
at
the
Elysée
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
The
Elysée
?
''
Dr.
Cottard
roared
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
at
M.
Grévy
's
,
''
replied
Swann
,
feeling
a
little
awkward
at
the
*NL*
effect
which
his
announcement
had
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
often
taken
like
that
?
''
the
painter
asked
Cottard
,
with
*NL*
mock-seriousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
rule
,
once
an
explanation
had
been
given
,
Cottard
would
say
:
``
Ah
,
*NL*
good
,
good
;
that
's
all
right
,
then
,
''
after
which
he
would
shew
not
the
*NL*
least
trace
of
emotion
.
But
this
time
Swann
's
last
words
,
instead
of
the
*NL*
usual
calming
effect
,
had
that
of
heating
,
instantly
,
to
boiling-point
*NL*
his
astonishment
at
the
discovery
that
a
man
with
whom
he
himself
*NL*
was
actually
sitting
at
table
,
a
man
who
had
no
official
position
,
no
*NL*
honours
or
distinction
of
any
sort
,
was
on
visiting
terms
with
the
Head
*NL*
of
the
State
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
you
say
?
M.
Grévy
?
Do
you
know
M.
Grévy
?
''
he
demanded
of
*NL*
Swann
,
in
the
stupid
and
incredulous
tone
of
a
constable
on
duty
at
the
*NL*
palace
,
when
a
stranger
has
come
up
and
asked
to
see
the
President
of
*NL*
the
Republic
;
until
,
guessing
from
his
words
and
manner
what
,
as
the
*NL*
newspapers
say
,
`
it
is
a
case
of
,
'
he
assures
the
poor
lunatic
that
he
*NL*
will
be
admitted
at
once
,
and
points
the
way
to
the
reception
ward
of
*NL*
the
police
infirmary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
him
slightly
;
we
have
some
friends
in
common
''
-LRB-
Swann
dared
not
*NL*
add
that
one
of
these
friends
was
the
Prince
of
Wales
-RRB-
.
``
Anyhow
,
he
is
*NL*
very
free
with
his
invitations
,
and
,
I
assure
you
,
his
luncheon-parties
*NL*
are
not
the
least
bit
amusing
;
they
're
very
simple
affairs
,
too
,
you
*NL*
know
;
never
more
than
eight
at
table
,
''
he
went
on
,
trying
desperately
*NL*
to
cut
out
everything
that
seemed
to
shew
off
his
relations
with
the
*NL*
President
in
a
light
too
dazzling
for
the
Doctor
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whereupon
Cottard
,
at
once
conforming
in
his
mind
to
the
literal
*NL*
interpretation
of
what
Swann
was
saying
,
decided
that
invitations
from
*NL*
M.
Grévy
were
very
little
sought
after
,
were
sent
out
,
in
fact
,
into
*NL*
the
highways
and
hedge-rows
.
And
from
that
moment
he
never
seemed
at
*NL*
all
surprised
to
hear
that
Swann
,
or
anyone
else
,
was
`
always
at
*NL*
the
Elysée
'
;
he
even
felt
a
little
sorry
for
a
man
who
had
to
go
to
*NL*
luncheon-parties
which
,
he
himself
admitted
,
were
a
bore
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good
,
good
;
that
's
quite
all
right
then
,
''
he
said
,
in
the
tone
of
*NL*
a
customs
official
who
has
been
suspicious
up
to
now
,
but
,
after
hearing
*NL*
your
explanations
,
stamps
your
passport
and
lets
you
proceed
on
your
*NL*
journey
without
troubling
to
examine
your
luggage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
well
believe
you
do
n't
find
them
amusing
,
those
parties
;
indeed
,
*NL*
it
's
very
good
of
you
to
go
to
them
!
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
regarded
*NL*
the
President
of
the
Republic
only
as
a
`
bore
'
to
be
especially
dreaded
,
*NL*
since
he
had
at
his
disposal
means
of
seduction
,
and
even
of
compulsion
,
*NL*
which
,
if
employed
to
captivate
her
`
faithful
,
'
might
easily
make
them
*NL*
`
fail
.
'
``
It
seems
,
he
's
as
deaf
as
a
post
;
and
eats
with
his
fingers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
!
Then
it
ca
n't
be
much
fun
for
you
,
going
there
.
''
A
*NL*
note
of
pity
sounded
in
the
Doctor
's
voice
;
and
then
struck
by
the
*NL*
number
--
only
eight
at
table
--
``
Are
these
luncheons
what
you
would
*NL*
describe
as
`
intimate
'
?
''
he
inquired
briskly
,
not
so
much
out
of
idle
*NL*
curiosity
as
in
his
linguistic
zeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
so
great
and
glorious
a
figure
was
the
President
of
the
French
*NL*
Republic
in
the
eyes
of
Dr.
Cottard
that
neither
the
modesty
of
Swann
*NL*
nor
the
spite
of
Mme.
Verdurin
could
ever
wholly
efface
that
first
*NL*
impression
,
and
he
never
sat
down
to
dinner
with
the
Verdurins
without
*NL*
asking
anxiously
,
``
D'you
think
we
shall
see
M.
Swann
here
this
evening
?
*NL*
He
is
a
personal
friend
of
M.
Grévy
's
.
I
suppose
that
means
he
's
what
*NL*
you
'd
call
a
`
gentleman
'
?
''
He
even
went
to
the
length
of
offering
Swann
*NL*
a
card
of
invitation
to
the
Dental
Exhibition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
let
you
in
,
and
anyone
you
take
with
you
,
''
he
explained
,
``
but
*NL*
dogs
are
not
admitted
.
I
'm
just
warning
you
,
you
understand
,
because
*NL*
some
friends
of
mine
went
there
once
,
who
had
n't
been
told
,
and
there
*NL*
was
the
devil
to
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
M.
Verdurin
,
he
did
not
fail
to
observe
the
distressing
effect
*NL*
upon
his
wife
of
the
discovery
that
Swann
had
influential
friends
of
*NL*
whom
he
had
never
spoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
no
arrangement
had
been
made
to
`
go
anywhere
,
'
it
was
at
the
*NL*
Verdurins
'
that
Swann
would
find
the
`
little
nucleus
'
assembled
,
but
*NL*
he
never
appeared
there
except
in
the
evenings
,
and
would
hardly
ever
*NL*
accept
their
invitations
to
dinner
,
in
spite
of
Odette
's
entreaties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
dine
with
you
alone
somewhere
,
if
you
'd
rather
,
''
she
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
about
Mme.
Verdurin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
quite
simple
.
I
need
only
say
that
my
dress
was
n't
ready
,
or
*NL*
that
my
cab
came
late
.
There
is
always
some
excuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
charming
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Swann
said
to
himself
that
,
if
he
could
make
Odette
feel
-LRB-
by
*NL*
consenting
to
meet
her
only
after
dinner
-RRB-
that
there
were
other
*NL*
pleasures
which
he
preferred
to
that
of
her
company
,
then
the
desire
*NL*
that
she
felt
for
his
would
be
all
the
longer
in
reaching
the
point
of
*NL*
satiety
.
Besides
,
as
he
infinitely
preferred
to
Odette
's
style
of
beauty
*NL*
that
of
a
little
working
girl
,
as
fresh
and
plump
as
a
rose
,
with
whom
*NL*
he
happened
to
be
simultaneously
in
love
,
he
preferred
to
spend
the
*NL*
first
part
of
the
evening
with
her
,
knowing
that
he
was
sure
to
see
*NL*
Odette
later
on
.
For
the
same
reason
,
he
would
never
allow
Odette
to
*NL*
call
for
him
at
his
house
,
to
take
him
on
to
the
Verdurins
'
.
The
little
*NL*
girl
used
to
wait
,
not
far
from
his
door
,
at
a
street
corner
;
Rémi
,
his
*NL*
coachman
,
knew
where
to
stop
;
she
would
jump
in
beside
him
,
and
hold
him
*NL*
in
her
arms
until
the
carriage
drew
up
at
the
Verdurins
'
.
He
would
enter
*NL*
the
drawing-room
;
and
there
,
while
Mme.
Verdurin
,
pointing
to
the
roses
*NL*
which
he
had
sent
her
that
morning
,
said
:
``
I
am
furious
with
you
!
''
and
*NL*
sent
him
to
the
place
kept
for
him
,
by
the
side
of
Odette
,
the
pianist
*NL*
would
play
to
them
--
for
their
two
selves
,
and
for
no
one
else
--
that
*NL*
little
phrase
by
Vinteuil
which
was
,
so
to
speak
,
the
national
anthem
of
*NL*
their
love
.
He
began
,
always
,
with
a
sustained
tremolo
from
the
violin
*NL*
part
,
which
,
for
several
bars
,
was
unaccompanied
,
and
filled
all
the
*NL*
foreground
;
until
suddenly
it
seemed
to
be
drawn
aside
,
and
--
just
as
in
*NL*
those
interiors
by
Pieter
de
Hooch
,
where
the
subject
is
set
back
a
*NL*
long
way
through
the
narrow
framework
of
a
half-opened
door
--
infinitely
*NL*
remote
,
in
colour
quite
different
,
velvety
with
the
radiance
of
some
*NL*
intervening
light
,
the
little
phrase
appeared
,
dancing
,
pastoral
,
*NL*
interpolated
,
episodic
,
belonging
to
another
world
.
It
passed
,
with
*NL*
simple
and
immortal
movements
,
scattering
on
every
side
the
bounties
of
*NL*
its
grace
,
smiling
ineffably
still
;
but
Swann
thought
that
he
could
now
*NL*
discern
in
it
some
disenchantment
.
It
seemed
to
be
aware
how
vain
,
how
*NL*
hollow
was
the
happiness
to
which
it
shewed
the
way
.
In
its
airy
grace
*NL*
there
was
,
indeed
,
something
definitely
achieved
,
and
complete
in
*NL*
itself
,
like
the
mood
of
philosophic
detachment
which
follows
an
*NL*
outburst
of
vain
regret
.
But
little
did
that
matter
to
him
;
he
looked
*NL*
upon
the
sonata
less
in
its
own
light
--
as
what
it
might
express
,
had
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
expressed
to
a
certain
musician
,
ignorant
that
any
Swann
or
*NL*
Odette
,
anywhere
in
the
world
,
existed
,
when
he
composed
it
,
and
*NL*
would
express
to
all
those
who
should
hear
it
played
in
centuries
*NL*
to
come
--
than
as
a
pledge
,
a
token
of
his
love
,
which
made
even
the
*NL*
Verdurins
and
their
little
pianist
think
of
Odette
and
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
of
himself
--
which
bound
her
to
him
by
a
lasting
tie
;
and
at
that
*NL*
point
he
had
-LRB-
whimsically
entreated
by
Odette
-RRB-
abandoned
the
idea
of
*NL*
getting
some
`
professional
'
to
play
over
to
him
the
whole
sonata
,
of
*NL*
which
he
still
knew
no
more
than
this
one
passage
.
``
Why
do
you
want
the
*NL*
rest
?
''
she
had
asked
him
.
``
Our
little
bit
;
that
's
all
we
need
.
''
He
went
*NL*
farther
;
agonised
by
the
reflection
,
at
the
moment
when
it
passed
by
*NL*
him
,
so
near
and
yet
so
infinitely
remote
,
that
,
while
it
was
addressed
*NL*
to
their
ears
,
it
knew
them
not
,
he
would
regret
,
almost
,
that
it
had
*NL*
a
meaning
of
its
own
,
an
intrinsic
and
unalterable
beauty
,
foreign
to
*NL*
themselves
,
just
as
in
the
jewels
given
to
us
,
or
even
in
the
letters
*NL*
written
to
us
by
a
woman
with
whom
we
are
in
love
,
we
find
fault
with
*NL*
the
`
water
'
of
a
stone
,
or
with
the
words
of
a
sentence
because
they
are
*NL*
not
fashioned
exclusively
from
the
spirit
of
a
fleeting
intimacy
and
of
*NL*
a
`
lass
unparalleled
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
happen
,
as
often
as
not
,
that
he
had
stayed
so
long
outside
,
*NL*
with
his
little
girl
,
before
going
to
the
Verdurins
'
that
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
little
phrase
had
been
rendered
by
the
pianist
,
Swann
would
discover
*NL*
that
it
was
almost
time
for
Odette
to
go
home
.
He
used
to
take
her
back
*NL*
as
far
as
the
door
of
her
little
house
in
the
Rue
La
Pérouse
,
behind
the
*NL*
Arc
de
Triomphe
.
And
it
was
perhaps
on
this
account
,
and
so
as
not
to
*NL*
demand
the
monopoly
of
her
favours
,
that
he
sacrificed
the
pleasure
-LRB-
not
*NL*
so
essential
to
his
well-being
-RRB-
of
seeing
her
earlier
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
of
arriving
with
her
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
to
the
exercise
of
this
other
*NL*
privilege
,
for
which
she
was
grateful
,
of
their
leaving
together
;
a
*NL*
privilege
which
he
valued
all
the
more
because
,
thanks
to
it
,
he
had
*NL*
the
feeling
that
no
one
else
would
see
her
,
no
one
would
thrust
himself
*NL*
between
them
,
no
one
could
prevent
him
from
remaining
with
her
in
*NL*
spirit
,
after
he
had
left
her
for
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
night
after
night
,
she
would
be
taken
home
in
Swann
's
carriage
;
*NL*
and
one
night
,
after
she
had
got
down
,
and
while
he
stood
at
the
gate
*NL*
and
murmured
``
Till
to-morrow
,
then
!
''
she
turned
impulsively
from
him
,
*NL*
plucked
a
last
lingering
chrysanthemum
in
the
tiny
garden
which
flanked
*NL*
the
pathway
from
the
street
to
her
house
,
and
as
he
went
back
to
his
*NL*
carriage
thrust
it
into
his
hand
.
He
held
it
pressed
to
his
lips
during
*NL*
the
drive
home
,
and
when
,
in
due
course
,
the
flower
withered
,
locked
it
*NL*
away
,
like
something
very
precious
,
in
a
secret
drawer
of
his
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
escort
her
to
her
gate
,
but
no
farther
.
Twice
only
had
he
gone
*NL*
inside
to
take
part
in
the
ceremony
--
of
such
vital
importance
in
her
*NL*
life
--
of
`
afternoon
tea
.
'
The
loneliness
and
emptiness
of
those
*NL*
short
streets
-LRB-
consisting
,
almost
entirely
,
of
low-roofed
houses
,
*NL*
self-contained
but
not
detached
,
their
monotony
interrupted
here
and
*NL*
there
by
the
dark
intrusion
of
some
sinister
little
shop
,
at
once
*NL*
an
historical
document
and
a
sordid
survival
from
the
days
when
the
*NL*
district
was
still
one
of
ill
repute
-RRB-
,
the
snow
which
had
lain
on
the
*NL*
garden-beds
or
clung
to
the
branches
of
the
trees
,
the
careless
disarray
*NL*
of
the
season
,
the
assertion
,
in
this
man-made
city
,
of
a
state
of
*NL*
nature
,
had
all
combined
to
add
an
element
of
mystery
to
the
warmth
,
the
*NL*
flowers
,
the
luxury
which
he
had
found
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passing
by
-LRB-
on
his
left-hand
side
,
and
on
what
,
although
raised
some
way
*NL*
above
the
street
,
was
the
ground
floor
of
the
house
-RRB-
Odette
's
bedroom
,
*NL*
which
looked
out
to
the
back
over
another
little
street
running
parallel
*NL*
with
her
own
,
he
had
climbed
a
staircase
that
went
straight
up
between
*NL*
dark
painted
walls
,
from
which
hung
Oriental
draperies
,
strings
of
*NL*
Turkish
beads
,
and
a
huge
Japanese
lantern
,
suspended
by
a
silken
cord
*NL*
from
the
ceiling
-LRB-
which
last
,
however
,
so
that
her
visitors
should
not
*NL*
have
to
complain
of
the
want
of
any
of
the
latest
comforts
of
*NL*
Western
civilisation
,
was
lighted
by
a
gas-jet
inside
-RRB-
,
to
the
two
*NL*
drawing-rooms
,
large
and
small
.
These
were
entered
through
a
narrow
*NL*
lobby
,
the
wall
of
which
,
chequered
with
the
lozenges
of
a
wooden
*NL*
trellis
such
as
you
see
on
garden
walls
,
only
gilded
,
was
lined
from
*NL*
end
to
end
by
a
long
rectangular
box
in
which
bloomed
,
as
though
in
a
*NL*
hothouse
,
a
row
of
large
chrysanthemums
,
at
that
time
still
*NL*
uncommon
,
though
by
no
means
so
large
as
the
mammoth
blossoms
which
*NL*
horticulturists
have
since
succeeded
in
making
grow
.
Swann
was
*NL*
irritated
,
as
a
rule
,
by
the
sight
of
these
flowers
,
which
had
then
been
*NL*
`
the
rage
'
in
Paris
for
about
a
year
,
but
it
had
pleased
him
,
on
this
*NL*
occasion
,
to
see
the
gloom
of
the
little
lobby
shot
with
rays
of
pink
*NL*
and
gold
and
white
by
the
fragrant
petals
of
these
ephemeral
stars
,
*NL*
which
kindle
their
cold
fires
in
the
murky
atmosphere
of
winter
*NL*
afternoons
.
Odette
had
received
him
in
a
tea-gown
of
pink
silk
,
which
*NL*
left
her
neck
and
arms
bare
.
She
had
made
him
sit
down
beside
her
in
one
*NL*
of
the
many
mysterious
little
retreats
which
had
been
contrived
in
the
*NL*
various
recesses
of
the
room
,
sheltered
by
enormous
palmtrees
growing
*NL*
out
of
pots
of
Chinese
porcelain
,
or
by
screens
upon
which
were
fastened
*NL*
photographs
and
fans
and
bows
of
ribbon
.
She
had
said
at
once
,
``
You
're
*NL*
not
comfortable
there
;
wait
a
minute
,
I
'll
arrange
things
for
you
,
''
and
*NL*
with
a
titter
of
laughter
,
the
complacency
of
which
implied
that
*NL*
some
little
invention
of
her
own
was
being
brought
into
play
,
she
*NL*
had
installed
behind
his
head
and
beneath
his
feet
great
cushions
of
*NL*
Japanese
silk
,
which
she
pummelled
and
buffeted
as
though
determined
to
*NL*
lavish
on
him
all
her
riches
,
and
regardless
of
their
value
.
But
when
*NL*
her
footman
began
to
come
into
the
room
,
bringing
,
one
after
another
,
*NL*
the
innumerable
lamps
which
-LRB-
contained
,
mostly
,
in
porcelain
vases
-RRB-
*NL*
burned
singly
or
in
pairs
upon
the
different
pieces
of
furniture
as
upon
*NL*
so
many
altars
,
rekindling
in
the
twilight
,
already
almost
nocturnal
,
of
*NL*
this
winter
afternoon
,
the
glow
of
a
sunset
more
lasting
,
more
roseate
,
*NL*
more
human
--
filling
,
perhaps
,
with
romantic
wonder
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
some
solitary
lover
,
wandering
in
the
street
below
and
brought
to
a
*NL*
standstill
before
the
mystery
of
the
human
presence
which
those
lighted
*NL*
windows
at
once
revealed
and
screened
from
sight
--
she
had
kept
an
eye
*NL*
sharply
fixed
on
the
servant
,
to
see
whether
he
set
each
of
the
lamps
*NL*
down
in
the
place
appointed
it
.
She
felt
that
,
if
he
were
to
put
*NL*
even
one
of
them
where
it
ought
not
to
be
,
the
general
effect
of
her
*NL*
drawing-room
would
be
destroyed
,
and
that
her
portrait
,
which
rested
*NL*
upon
a
sloping
easel
draped
with
plush
,
would
not
catch
the
light
.
And
*NL*
so
,
with
feverish
impatience
,
she
followed
the
man
's
clumsy
movements
,
*NL*
scolding
him
severely
when
he
passed
too
close
to
a
pair
of
beaupots
,
*NL*
which
she
made
a
point
of
always
tidying
herself
,
in
case
the
plants
*NL*
should
be
knocked
over
--
and
went
across
to
them
now
to
make
sure
that
he
*NL*
had
not
broken
off
any
of
the
flowers
.
She
found
something
`
quaint
'
in
*NL*
the
shape
of
each
of
her
Chinese
ornaments
,
and
also
in
her
orchids
,
the
*NL*
cattleyas
especially
-LRB-
these
being
,
with
chrysanthemums
,
her
favourite
*NL*
flowers
-RRB-
,
because
they
had
the
supreme
merit
of
not
looking
in
the
least
*NL*
like
other
flowers
,
but
of
being
made
,
apparently
,
out
of
scraps
of
silk
*NL*
or
satin
.
``
It
looks
just
as
though
it
had
been
cut
out
of
the
lining
*NL*
of
my
cloak
,
''
she
said
to
Swann
,
pointing
to
an
orchid
,
with
a
shade
of
*NL*
respect
in
her
voice
for
so
`
smart
'
a
flower
,
for
this
distinguished
,
*NL*
unexpected
sister
whom
nature
had
suddenly
bestowed
upon
her
,
so
far
*NL*
removed
from
her
in
the
scale
of
existence
,
and
yet
so
delicate
,
so
*NL*
refined
,
so
much
more
worthy
than
many
real
women
of
admission
to
*NL*
her
drawing-room
.
As
she
drew
his
attention
,
now
to
the
fiery-tongued
*NL*
dragons
painted
upon
a
bowl
or
stitched
upon
a
fire-screen
,
now
to
a
*NL*
fleshy
cluster
of
orchids
,
now
to
a
dromedary
of
inlaid
silver-work
with
*NL*
ruby
eyes
,
which
kept
company
,
upon
her
mantelpiece
,
with
a
toad
carved
*NL*
in
jade
,
she
would
pretend
now
to
be
shrinking
from
the
ferocity
of
the
*NL*
monsters
or
laughing
at
their
absurdity
,
now
blushing
at
the
indecency
*NL*
of
the
flowers
,
now
carried
away
by
an
irresistible
desire
to
run
across
*NL*
and
kiss
the
toad
and
dromedary
,
calling
them
`
darlings
.
'
And
these
*NL*
affectations
were
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
sincerity
of
some
of
her
*NL*
attitudes
,
notably
her
devotion
to
Our
Lady
of
the
Laghetto
who
had
*NL*
once
,
when
Odette
was
living
at
Nice
,
cured
her
of
a
mortal
illness
,
and
*NL*
whose
medal
,
in
gold
,
she
always
carried
on
her
person
,
attributing
*NL*
to
it
unlimited
powers
.
She
poured
out
Swann
's
tea
,
inquired
``
Lemon
*NL*
or
cream
?
''
and
,
on
his
answering
``
Cream
,
please
,
''
went
on
,
smiling
,
``
A
*NL*
cloud
!
''
And
as
he
pronounced
it
excellent
,
``
You
see
,
I
know
just
how
you
*NL*
like
it
.
''
This
tea
had
indeed
seemed
to
Swann
,
just
as
it
seemed
to
*NL*
her
,
something
precious
,
and
love
is
so
far
obliged
to
find
some
*NL*
justification
for
itself
,
some
guarantee
of
its
duration
in
pleasures
*NL*
which
,
on
the
contrary
,
would
have
no
existence
apart
from
love
and
must
*NL*
cease
with
its
passing
,
that
when
he
left
her
,
at
seven
o'clock
,
to
go
*NL*
and
dress
for
the
evening
,
all
the
way
home
,
sitting
bolt
upright
in
*NL*
his
brougham
,
unable
to
repress
the
happiness
with
which
the
afternoon
's
*NL*
adventure
had
filled
him
,
he
kept
on
repeating
to
himself
:
``
What
fun
*NL*
it
would
be
to
have
a
little
woman
like
that
in
a
place
where
one
could
*NL*
always
be
certain
of
finding
,
what
one
never
can
be
certain
of
finding
,
*NL*
a
really
good
cup
of
tea
.
''
An
hour
or
so
later
he
received
a
note
from
*NL*
Odette
,
and
at
once
recognised
that
florid
handwriting
,
in
which
an
*NL*
affectation
of
British
stiffness
imposed
an
apparent
discipline
upon
its
*NL*
shapeless
characters
,
significant
,
perhaps
,
to
less
intimate
eyes
*NL*
than
his
,
of
an
untidiness
of
mind
,
a
fragmentary
education
,
a
want
of
*NL*
sincerity
and
decision
.
Swann
had
left
his
cigarette-case
at
her
house
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
she
wrote
,
``
did
you
not
forget
your
heart
also
?
I
should
never
*NL*
have
let
you
have
that
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
More
important
,
perhaps
,
was
a
second
visit
which
he
paid
her
,
a
little
*NL*
later
.
On
his
way
to
the
house
,
as
always
when
he
knew
that
they
were
to
*NL*
meet
,
he
formed
a
picture
of
her
in
his
mind
;
and
the
necessity
,
if
he
*NL*
was
to
find
any
beauty
in
her
face
,
of
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
fresh
and
*NL*
rosy
protuberance
of
her
cheekbones
,
and
of
shutting
out
all
the
rest
of
*NL*
those
cheeks
which
were
so
often
languorous
and
sallow
,
except
when
*NL*
they
were
punctuated
with
little
fiery
spots
,
plunged
him
in
acute
*NL*
depression
,
as
proving
that
one
's
ideal
is
always
unattainable
,
and
*NL*
one
's
actual
happiness
mediocre
.
He
was
taking
her
an
engraving
which
*NL*
she
had
asked
to
see
.
She
was
not
very
well
;
she
received
him
,
wearing
*NL*
a
wrapper
of
mauve
_
crêpe
de
Chine
_
,
which
draped
her
bosom
,
like
a
*NL*
mantle
,
with
a
richly
embroidered
web
.
As
she
stood
there
beside
him
,
*NL*
brushing
his
cheek
with
the
loosened
tresses
of
her
hair
,
bending
one
*NL*
knee
in
what
was
almost
a
dancer
's
pose
,
so
that
she
could
lean
without
*NL*
tiring
herself
over
the
picture
,
at
which
she
was
gazing
,
with
bended
*NL*
head
,
out
of
those
great
eyes
,
which
seemed
so
weary
and
so
sullen
when
*NL*
there
was
nothing
to
animate
her
,
Swann
was
struck
by
her
resemblance
to
*NL*
the
figure
of
Zipporah
,
Jethro
's
Daughter
,
which
is
to
be
seen
in
one
*NL*
of
the
Sistine
frescoes
.
He
had
always
found
a
peculiar
fascination
*NL*
in
tracing
in
the
paintings
of
the
Old
Masters
,
not
merely
the
general
*NL*
characteristics
of
the
people
whom
he
encountered
in
his
daily
life
,
but
*NL*
rather
what
seems
least
susceptible
of
generalisation
,
the
individual
*NL*
features
of
men
and
women
whom
he
knew
,
as
,
for
instance
,
in
a
bust
*NL*
of
the
Doge
Loredan
by
Antonio
Rizzo
,
the
prominent
cheekbones
,
the
*NL*
slanting
eyebrows
,
in
short
,
a
speaking
likeness
to
his
own
coachman
*NL*
Rémi
;
in
the
colouring
of
a
Ghirlandaio
,
the
nose
of
M.
de
Palancy
;
in
a
*NL*
portrait
by
Tintoretto
,
the
invasion
of
the
plumpness
of
the
cheek
by
an
*NL*
outcrop
of
whisker
,
the
broken
nose
,
the
penetrating
stare
,
the
swollen
*NL*
eyelids
of
Dr.
du
Boulbon
.
Perhaps
because
he
had
always
regretted
,
*NL*
in
his
heart
,
that
he
had
confined
his
attention
to
the
social
side
of
*NL*
life
,
had
talked
,
always
,
rather
than
acted
,
he
felt
that
he
might
find
*NL*
a
sort
of
indulgence
bestowed
upon
him
by
those
great
artists
,
in
his
*NL*
perception
of
the
fact
that
they
also
had
regarded
with
pleasure
and
had
*NL*
admitted
into
the
canon
of
their
works
such
types
of
physiognomy
as
give
*NL*
those
works
the
strongest
possible
certificate
of
reality
and
trueness
*NL*
to
life
;
a
modern
,
almost
a
topical
savour
;
perhaps
,
also
,
he
had
so
far
*NL*
succumbed
to
the
prevailing
frivolity
of
the
world
of
fashion
that
he
*NL*
felt
the
necessity
of
finding
in
an
old
masterpiece
some
such
obvious
*NL*
and
refreshing
allusion
to
a
person
about
whom
jokes
could
be
made
and
*NL*
repeated
and
enjoyed
to-day
.
Perhaps
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
had
*NL*
retained
enough
of
the
artistic
temperament
to
be
able
to
find
a
genuine
*NL*
satisfaction
in
watching
these
individual
features
take
on
a
more
*NL*
general
significance
when
he
saw
them
,
uprooted
and
disembodied
,
in
the
*NL*
abstract
idea
of
similarity
between
an
historic
portrait
and
a
modern
*NL*
original
,
whom
it
was
not
intended
to
represent
.
However
that
might
be
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
because
the
abundance
of
impressions
which
he
,
for
some
time
*NL*
past
,
had
been
receiving
--
though
,
indeed
,
they
had
come
to
him
rather
*NL*
through
the
channel
of
his
appreciation
of
music
--
had
enriched
his
*NL*
appetite
for
painting
as
well
,
it
was
with
an
unusual
intensity
*NL*
of
pleasure
,
a
pleasure
destined
to
have
a
lasting
effect
upon
his
*NL*
character
and
conduct
,
that
Swann
remarked
Odette
's
resemblance
to
the
*NL*
Zipporah
of
that
Alessandro
de
Mariano
,
to
whom
one
shrinks
from
giving
*NL*
his
more
popular
surname
,
now
that
`
Botticelli
'
suggests
not
so
much
the
*NL*
actual
work
of
the
Master
as
that
false
and
banal
conception
of
it
which
*NL*
has
of
late
obtained
common
currency
.
He
no
longer
based
his
estimate
*NL*
of
the
merit
of
Odette
's
face
on
the
more
or
less
good
quality
of
her
*NL*
cheeks
,
and
the
softness
and
sweetness
--
as
of
carnation-petals
--
which
,
*NL*
he
supposed
,
would
greet
his
lips
there
,
should
he
ever
hazard
an
*NL*
embrace
,
but
regarded
it
rather
as
a
skein
of
subtle
and
lovely
silken
*NL*
threads
,
which
his
gazing
eyes
collected
and
wound
together
,
following
*NL*
the
curving
line
from
the
skein
to
the
ball
,
where
he
mingled
the
*NL*
cadence
of
her
neck
with
the
spring
of
her
hair
and
the
droop
of
her
*NL*
eyelids
,
as
though
from
a
portrait
of
herself
,
in
which
her
type
was
*NL*
made
clearly
intelligible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
gazing
at
her
;
traces
of
the
old
fresco
were
apparent
in
*NL*
her
face
and
limbs
,
and
these
he
tried
incessantly
,
afterwards
,
to
*NL*
recapture
,
both
when
he
was
with
Odette
,
and
when
he
was
only
thinking
*NL*
of
her
in
her
absence
;
and
,
albeit
his
admiration
for
the
Florentine
*NL*
masterpiece
was
probably
based
upon
his
discovery
that
it
had
been
*NL*
reproduced
in
her
,
the
similarity
enhanced
her
beauty
also
,
and
rendered
*NL*
her
more
precious
in
his
sight
.
Swann
reproached
himself
with
his
*NL*
failure
,
hitherto
,
to
estimate
at
her
true
worth
a
creature
whom
the
*NL*
great
Sandro
would
have
adored
,
and
counted
himself
fortunate
that
his
*NL*
pleasure
in
the
contemplation
of
Odette
found
a
justification
in
his
own
*NL*
system
of
aesthetic
.
He
told
himself
that
,
in
choosing
the
thought
of
*NL*
Odette
as
the
inspiration
of
his
dreams
of
ideal
happiness
,
he
was
not
,
*NL*
as
he
had
until
then
supposed
,
falling
back
,
merely
,
upon
an
expedient
*NL*
of
doubtful
and
certainly
inadequate
value
,
since
she
contained
in
*NL*
herself
what
satisfied
the
utmost
refinement
of
his
taste
in
art
.
He
*NL*
failed
to
observe
that
this
quality
would
not
naturally
avail
to
bring
*NL*
Odette
into
the
category
of
women
whom
he
found
desirable
,
simply
*NL*
because
his
desires
had
always
run
counter
to
his
aesthetic
taste
.
The
*NL*
words
`
Florentine
painting
'
were
invaluable
to
Swann
.
They
enabled
him
*NL*
-LRB-
gave
him
,
as
it
were
,
a
legal
title
-RRB-
to
introduce
the
image
of
Odette
*NL*
into
a
world
of
dreams
and
fancies
which
,
until
then
,
she
had
been
*NL*
debarred
from
entering
,
and
where
she
assumed
a
new
and
nobler
form
.
And
*NL*
whereas
the
mere
sight
of
her
in
the
flesh
,
by
perpetually
reviving
his
*NL*
misgivings
as
to
the
quality
of
her
face
,
her
figure
,
the
whole
of
her
*NL*
beauty
,
used
to
cool
the
ardour
of
his
love
,
those
misgivings
were
swept
*NL*
away
and
that
love
confirmed
now
that
he
could
re-erect
his
estimate
of
*NL*
her
on
the
sure
foundations
of
his
aesthetic
principles
;
while
the
kiss
,
*NL*
the
bodily
surrender
which
would
have
seemed
natural
and
but
moderately
*NL*
attractive
,
had
they
been
granted
him
by
a
creature
of
somewhat
withered
*NL*
flesh
and
sluggish
blood
,
coming
,
as
now
they
came
,
to
crown
his
*NL*
adoration
of
a
masterpiece
in
a
gallery
,
must
,
it
seemed
,
prove
as
*NL*
exquisite
as
they
would
be
supernatural
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
he
was
tempted
to
regret
that
,
for
months
past
,
he
had
done
*NL*
nothing
but
visit
Odette
,
he
would
assure
himself
that
he
was
*NL*
not
unreasonable
in
giving
up
much
of
his
time
to
the
study
of
an
*NL*
inestimably
precious
work
of
art
,
cast
for
once
in
a
new
,
a
different
,
*NL*
an
especially
charming
metal
,
in
an
unmatched
exemplar
which
he
would
*NL*
contemplate
at
one
moment
with
the
humble
,
spiritual
,
disinterested
mind
*NL*
of
an
artist
,
at
another
with
the
pride
,
the
selfishness
,
the
sensual
*NL*
thrill
of
a
collector
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
study
table
,
at
which
he
worked
,
he
had
placed
,
as
it
were
a
*NL*
photograph
of
Odette
,
a
reproduction
of
Jethro
's
Daughter
.
He
would
*NL*
gaze
in
admiration
at
the
large
eyes
,
the
delicate
features
in
which
the
*NL*
imperfection
of
her
skin
might
be
surmised
,
the
marvellous
locks
of
hair
*NL*
that
fell
along
her
tired
cheeks
;
and
,
adapting
what
he
had
already
felt
*NL*
to
be
beautiful
,
on
aesthetic
grounds
,
to
the
idea
of
a
living
woman
,
*NL*
he
converted
it
into
a
series
of
physical
merits
which
he
congratulated
*NL*
himself
on
finding
assembled
in
the
person
of
one
whom
he
might
,
*NL*
ultimately
,
possess
.
The
vague
feeling
of
sympathy
which
attracts
a
*NL*
spectator
to
a
work
of
art
,
now
that
he
knew
the
type
,
in
warm
flesh
*NL*
and
blood
,
of
Jethro
's
Daughter
,
became
a
desire
which
more
than
*NL*
compensated
,
thenceforward
,
for
that
with
which
Odette
's
physical
charms
*NL*
had
at
first
failed
to
inspire
him
.
When
he
had
sat
for
a
long
time
*NL*
gazing
at
the
Botticelli
,
he
would
think
of
his
own
living
Botticelli
,
*NL*
who
seemed
all
the
lovelier
in
contrast
,
and
as
he
drew
towards
him
*NL*
the
photograph
of
Zipporah
he
would
imagine
that
he
was
holding
Odette
*NL*
against
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
only
Odette
's
indifference
,
however
,
that
he
must
take
pains
*NL*
to
circumvent
;
it
was
also
,
not
infrequently
,
his
own
;
feeling
that
,
*NL*
since
Odette
had
had
every
facility
for
seeing
him
,
she
seemed
no
longer
*NL*
to
have
very
much
to
say
to
him
when
they
did
meet
,
he
was
afraid
*NL*
lest
the
manner
--
at
once
trivial
,
monotonous
,
and
seemingly
*NL*
unalterable
--
which
she
now
adopted
when
they
were
together
should
*NL*
ultimately
destroy
in
him
that
romantic
hope
,
that
a
day
might
come
when
*NL*
she
would
make
avowal
of
her
passion
,
by
which
hope
alone
he
had
become
*NL*
and
would
remain
her
lover
.
And
so
to
alter
,
to
give
a
fresh
moral
*NL*
aspect
to
that
Odette
,
of
whose
unchanging
mood
he
was
afraid
of
growing
*NL*
weary
,
he
wrote
,
suddenly
,
a
letter
full
of
hinted
discoveries
and
*NL*
feigned
indignation
,
which
he
sent
off
so
that
it
should
reach
her
*NL*
before
dinner-time
.
He
knew
that
she
would
be
frightened
,
and
that
she
*NL*
would
reply
,
and
he
hoped
that
,
when
the
fear
of
losing
him
clutched
at
*NL*
her
heart
,
it
would
force
from
her
words
such
as
he
had
never
yet
heard
*NL*
her
utter
:
and
he
was
right
--
by
repeating
this
device
he
had
won
from
*NL*
her
the
most
affectionate
letters
that
she
had
,
so
far
,
written
him
,
one
*NL*
of
them
-LRB-
which
she
had
sent
to
him
at
midday
by
a
special
messenger
from
*NL*
the
Maison
Dorée
--
it
was
the
day
of
the
Paris-Murcie
Fête
given
for
*NL*
the
victims
of
the
recent
floods
in
Murcia
-RRB-
beginning
``
My
dear
,
my
hand
*NL*
trembles
so
that
I
can
scarcely
write
--
''
;
and
these
letters
he
had
*NL*
kept
in
the
same
drawer
as
the
withered
chrysanthemum
.
Or
else
,
if
she
*NL*
had
not
had
time
to
write
,
when
he
arrived
at
the
Verdurins
'
she
would
*NL*
come
running
up
to
him
with
an
``
I
've
something
to
say
to
you
!
''
and
he
*NL*
would
gaze
curiously
at
the
revelation
in
her
face
and
speech
of
what
*NL*
she
had
hitherto
kept
concealed
from
him
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
as
he
drew
near
to
the
Verdurins
'
door
,
and
caught
sight
of
the
*NL*
great
lamp-lit
spaces
of
the
drawing-room
windows
,
whose
shutters
were
*NL*
never
closed
,
he
would
begin
to
melt
at
the
thought
of
the
charming
*NL*
creature
whom
he
would
see
,
as
he
entered
the
room
,
basking
in
that
*NL*
golden
light
.
Here
and
there
the
figures
of
the
guests
stood
out
,
sharp
*NL*
and
black
,
between
lamp
and
window
,
shutting
off
the
light
,
like
those
*NL*
little
pictures
which
one
sees
sometimes
pasted
here
and
there
upon
a
*NL*
glass
screen
,
whose
other
panes
are
mere
transparencies
.
He
would
try
*NL*
to
make
out
Odette
.
And
then
,
when
he
was
once
inside
,
without
thinking
,
*NL*
his
eyes
sparkled
suddenly
with
such
radiant
happiness
that
M.
Verdurin
*NL*
said
to
the
painter
:
``
H
'm
.
Seems
to
be
getting
warm
.
''
Indeed
,
her
*NL*
presence
gave
the
house
what
none
other
of
the
houses
that
he
visited
*NL*
seemed
to
possess
:
a
sort
of
tactual
sense
,
a
nervous
system
which
*NL*
ramified
into
each
of
its
rooms
and
sent
a
constant
stimulus
to
his
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
the
simple
and
regular
manifestations
of
a
social
organism
,
*NL*
namely
the
`
little
clan
,
'
were
transformed
for
Swann
into
a
series
of
*NL*
daily
encounters
with
Odette
,
and
enabled
him
to
feign
indifference
to
*NL*
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
,
or
even
a
desire
not
to
see
her
;
in
doing
*NL*
which
he
incurred
no
very
great
risk
since
,
even
although
he
had
written
*NL*
to
her
during
the
day
,
he
would
of
necessity
see
her
in
the
evening
and
*NL*
accompany
her
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
one
evening
,
when
,
irritated
by
the
thought
of
that
inevitable
dark
*NL*
drive
together
,
he
had
taken
his
other
`
little
girl
'
all
the
way
to
the
*NL*
Bois
,
so
as
to
delay
as
long
as
possible
the
moment
of
his
appearance
at
*NL*
the
Verdurins
'
,
he
was
so
late
in
reaching
them
that
Odette
,
supposing
*NL*
that
he
did
not
intend
to
come
,
had
already
left
.
Seeing
the
room
bare
*NL*
of
her
,
Swann
felt
his
heart
wrung
by
sudden
anguish
;
he
shook
with
the
*NL*
sense
that
he
was
being
deprived
of
a
pleasure
whose
intensity
he
began
*NL*
then
for
the
first
time
to
estimate
,
having
always
,
hitherto
,
had
that
*NL*
certainty
of
finding
it
whenever
he
would
,
which
-LRB-
as
in
the
case
of
*NL*
all
our
pleasures
-RRB-
reduced
,
if
it
did
not
altogether
blind
him
to
its
*NL*
dimensions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
notice
the
face
he
pulled
when
he
saw
that
she
was
n't
here
?
''
M.
*NL*
Verdurin
asked
his
wife
.
``
I
think
we
may
say
that
he
's
hooked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
face
he
pulled
?
''
exploded
Dr.
Cottard
who
,
having
left
the
house
*NL*
for
a
moment
to
visit
a
patient
,
had
just
returned
to
fetch
his
wife
and
*NL*
did
not
know
whom
they
were
discussing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'you
mean
to
say
you
did
n't
meet
him
on
the
doorstep
--
the
loveliest
of
*NL*
Swanns
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
M.
Swann
has
been
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
for
a
moment
.
We
had
a
glimpse
of
a
Swann
tremendously
agitated
.
*NL*
In
a
state
of
nerves
.
You
see
,
Odette
had
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
say
that
she
has
gone
the
`
whole
hog
'
with
him
;
that
she
*NL*
has
`
burned
her
boats
'
?
''
inquired
the
Doctor
cautiously
,
testing
the
*NL*
meaning
of
his
phrases
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
not
;
there
's
absolutely
nothing
in
it
;
in
fact
,
between
*NL*
you
and
me
,
I
think
she
's
making
a
great
mistake
,
and
behaving
like
a
*NL*
silly
little
fool
,
which
she
is
,
incidentally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
come
!
''
said
M.
Verdurin
,
``
How
on
earth
do
you
know
that
*NL*
there
's
`
nothing
in
it
'
?
We
have
n't
been
there
to
see
,
have
we
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
would
have
told
me
,
''
answered
Mme.
Verdurin
with
dignity
.
``
I
may
*NL*
say
that
she
tells
me
everything
.
As
she
has
no
one
else
at
present
,
I
*NL*
told
her
that
she
ought
to
live
with
him
.
She
makes
out
that
she
ca
n't
;
*NL*
she
admits
,
she
was
immensely
attracted
by
him
,
at
first
;
but
he
's
*NL*
always
shy
with
her
,
and
that
makes
her
shy
with
him
.
Besides
,
she
*NL*
does
n't
care
for
him
in
that
way
,
she
says
;
it
's
an
ideal
love
,
*NL*
`
Platonic
,
'
you
know
;
she
's
afraid
of
rubbing
the
bloom
off
--
oh
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
half
the
things
she
says
,
how
should
I
?
And
yet
he
's
exactly
the
*NL*
sort
of
man
she
wants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
to
differ
from
you
,
''
M.
Verdurin
courteously
interrupted
.
``
I
am
*NL*
only
half
satisfied
with
the
gentleman
.
I
feel
that
he
`
poses
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
's
whole
body
stiffened
,
her
eyes
stared
blankly
as
though
*NL*
she
had
suddenly
been
turned
into
a
statue
;
a
device
by
means
of
which
*NL*
she
might
be
supposed
not
to
have
caught
the
sound
of
that
unutterable
*NL*
word
which
seemed
to
imply
that
it
was
possible
for
people
to
`
pose
'
*NL*
in
her
house
,
and
,
therefore
,
that
there
were
people
in
the
world
who
*NL*
`
mattered
more
'
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
,
if
there
is
nothing
in
it
,
I
do
n't
suppose
it
's
because
our
*NL*
friend
believes
in
her
virtue
.
And
yet
,
you
never
know
;
he
seems
to
*NL*
believe
in
her
intelligence
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
heard
the
way
he
*NL*
lectured
her
the
other
evening
about
Vinteuil
's
sonata
.
I
am
devoted
*NL*
to
Odette
,
but
really
--
to
expound
theories
of
aesthetic
to
her
--
the
man
*NL*
must
be
a
prize
idiot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
I
wo
n't
have
you
saying
nasty
things
about
Odette
,
''
broke
in
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
in
her
`
spoiled
child
'
manner
.
``
She
is
charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
reason
why
she
should
n't
be
charming
;
we
are
not
saying
*NL*
anything
nasty
about
her
,
only
that
she
is
not
the
embodiment
of
either
*NL*
virtue
or
intellect
.
After
all
,
''
he
turned
to
the
painter
,
``
does
it
*NL*
matter
so
very
much
whether
she
is
virtuous
or
not
?
You
ca
n't
tell
;
she
*NL*
might
be
a
great
deal
less
charming
if
she
were

''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
landing
Swann
had
run
into
the
Verdurins
'
butler
,
who
had
been
*NL*
somewhere
else
a
moment
earlier
,
when
he
arrived
,
and
who
had
been
asked
*NL*
by
Odette
to
tell
Swann
-LRB-
but
that
was
at
least
an
hour
ago
-RRB-
that
she
*NL*
would
probably
stop
to
drink
a
cup
of
chocolate
at
Prévost
's
on
her
*NL*
way
home
.
Swann
set
off
at
once
for
Prévost
's
,
but
every
few
yards
*NL*
his
carriage
was
held
up
by
others
,
or
by
people
crossing
the
street
,
*NL*
loathsome
obstacles
each
of
which
he
would
gladly
have
crushed
beneath
*NL*
his
wheels
,
were
it
not
that
a
policeman
fumbling
with
a
note-book
would
*NL*
delay
him
even
longer
than
the
actual
passage
of
the
pedestrian
.
He
*NL*
counted
the
minutes
feverishly
,
adding
a
few
seconds
to
each
so
as
to
*NL*
be
quite
certain
that
he
had
not
given
himself
short
measure
,
and
so
,
*NL*
possibly
,
exaggerated
whatever
chance
there
might
actually
be
of
his
*NL*
arriving
at
Prévost
's
in
time
,
and
of
finding
her
still
there
.
And
then
,
*NL*
in
a
moment
of
illumination
,
like
a
man
in
a
fever
who
awakes
from
sleep
*NL*
and
is
conscious
of
the
absurdity
of
the
dream-shapes
among
which
his
*NL*
mind
has
been
wandering
without
any
clear
distinction
between
himself
*NL*
and
them
,
Swann
suddenly
perceived
how
foreign
to
his
nature
were
the
*NL*
thoughts
which
he
had
been
revolving
in
his
mind
ever
since
he
had
heard
*NL*
at
the
Verdurins
'
that
Odette
had
left
,
how
novel
the
heartache
from
*NL*
which
he
was
suffering
,
but
of
which
he
was
only
now
conscious
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
just
woken
up
.
What
!
all
this
disturbance
simply
because
*NL*
he
would
not
see
Odette
,
now
,
till
to-morrow
,
exactly
what
he
had
been
*NL*
hoping
,
not
an
hour
before
,
as
he
drove
toward
Mme.
Verdurin
's
.
He
was
*NL*
obliged
to
admit
also
that
now
,
as
he
sat
in
the
same
carriage
and
*NL*
drove
to
Prévost
's
,
he
was
no
longer
the
same
man
,
was
no
longer
alone
*NL*
even
--
but
that
a
new
personality
was
there
beside
him
,
adhering
to
him
,
*NL*
amalgamated
with
him
,
a
creature
from
whom
he
might
,
perhaps
,
be
unable
*NL*
to
liberate
himself
,
towards
whom
he
might
have
to
adopt
some
such
*NL*
stratagem
as
one
uses
to
outwit
a
master
or
a
malady
.
And
yet
,
during
*NL*
this
last
moment
in
which
he
had
felt
that
another
,
a
fresh
personality
*NL*
was
thus
conjoined
with
his
own
,
life
had
seemed
,
somehow
,
more
*NL*
interesting
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
he
assured
himself
that
this
possible
meeting
at
*NL*
Prévost
's
-LRB-
the
tension
of
waiting
for
which
so
ravished
,
stripped
so
*NL*
bare
the
intervening
moments
that
he
could
find
nothing
,
not
one
idea
,
*NL*
not
one
memory
in
his
mind
beneath
which
his
troubled
spirit
might
take
*NL*
shelter
and
repose
-RRB-
would
probably
,
after
all
,
should
it
take
place
,
be
*NL*
much
the
same
as
all
their
meetings
,
of
no
great
importance
.
As
on
every
*NL*
other
evening
,
once
he
was
in
Odette
's
company
,
once
he
had
begun
to
*NL*
cast
furtive
glances
at
her
changing
countenance
,
and
instantly
to
*NL*
withdraw
his
eyes
lest
she
should
read
in
them
the
first
symbols
of
*NL*
desire
and
believe
no
more
in
his
indifference
,
he
would
cease
to
*NL*
be
able
even
to
think
of
her
,
so
busy
would
he
be
in
the
search
for
*NL*
pretexts
which
would
enable
him
not
to
leave
her
immediately
,
and
to
*NL*
assure
himself
,
without
betraying
his
concern
,
that
he
would
find
her
*NL*
again
,
next
evening
,
at
the
Verdurins
'
;
pretexts
,
that
is
to
say
,
which
*NL*
would
enable
him
to
prolong
for
the
time
being
,
and
to
renew
for
one
day
*NL*
more
the
disappointment
,
the
torturing
deception
that
must
always
come
*NL*
to
him
with
the
vain
presence
of
this
woman
,
whom
he
might
approach
,
yet
*NL*
never
dared
embrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
at
Prevost
's
;
he
must
search
for
her
,
then
,
in
every
*NL*
restaurant
upon
the
boulevards
.
To
save
time
,
while
he
went
in
one
*NL*
direction
,
he
sent
in
the
other
his
coachman
Rémi
-LRB-
Rizzo
's
Doge
Loredan
-RRB-
*NL*
for
whom
he
presently
--
after
a
fruitless
search
--
found
himself
waiting
*NL*
at
the
spot
where
the
carriage
was
to
meet
him
.
It
did
not
appear
,
and
*NL*
Swann
tantalised
himself
with
alternate
pictures
of
the
approaching
*NL*
moment
,
as
one
in
which
Rémi
would
say
to
him
:
``
Sir
,
the
lady
is
there
,
''
*NL*
or
as
one
in
which
Rémi
would
say
to
him
:
``
Sir
,
the
lady
was
not
in
*NL*
any
of
the
cafés
.
''
And
so
he
saw
himself
faced
by
the
close
of
his
*NL*
evening
--
a
thing
uniform
,
and
yet
bifurcated
by
the
intervening
accident
*NL*
which
would
either
put
an
end
to
his
agony
by
discovering
Odette
,
or
*NL*
would
oblige
him
to
abandon
any
hope
of
finding
her
that
night
,
to
*NL*
accept
the
necessity
of
returning
home
without
having
seen
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
returned
;
but
,
as
he
drew
up
opposite
him
,
Swann
asked
,
*NL*
not
``
Did
you
find
the
lady
?
''
but
``
Remind
me
,
to-morrow
,
to
order
in
*NL*
some
more
firewood
.
I
am
sure
we
must
be
running
short
.
''
Perhaps
he
had
*NL*
persuaded
himself
that
,
if
Rémi
had
at
last
found
Odette
in
some
café
,
*NL*
where
she
was
waiting
for
him
still
,
then
his
night
of
misery
was
*NL*
already
obliterated
by
the
realisation
,
begun
already
in
his
mind
,
of
a
*NL*
night
of
joy
,
and
that
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
hasten
towards
the
*NL*
attainment
of
a
happiness
already
captured
and
held
in
a
safe
place
,
*NL*
which
would
not
escape
his
grasp
again
.
But
it
was
also
by
the
force
of
*NL*
inertia
;
there
was
in
his
soul
that
want
of
adaptability
which
can
be
*NL*
seen
in
the
bodies
of
certain
people
who
,
when
the
moment
comes
to
avoid
*NL*
a
collision
,
to
snatch
their
clothes
out
of
reach
of
a
flame
,
or
to
*NL*
perform
any
other
such
necessary
movement
,
take
their
time
-LRB-
as
the
*NL*
saying
is
-RRB-
,
begin
by
remaining
for
a
moment
in
their
original
position
,
*NL*
as
though
seeking
to
find
in
it
a
starting-point
,
a
source
of
strength
*NL*
and
motion
.
And
probably
,
if
the
coachman
had
interrupted
him
with
,
*NL*
``
I
have
found
the
lady
,
''
he
would
have
answered
,
``
Oh
,
yes
,
of
course
;
*NL*
that
's
what
I
told
you
to
do
.
I
had
quite
forgotten
,
''
and
would
have
*NL*
continued
to
discuss
his
supply
of
firewood
,
so
as
to
hide
from
his
*NL*
servant
the
emotion
that
he
had
felt
,
and
to
give
himself
time
to
break
*NL*
away
from
the
thraldom
of
his
anxieties
and
abandon
himself
to
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
came
back
,
however
,
with
the
report
that
he
could
not
find
*NL*
her
anywhere
,
and
added
the
advice
,
as
an
old
and
privileged
servant
,
``
I
*NL*
think
,
sir
,
that
all
we
can
do
now
is
to
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
air
of
indifference
which
Swann
could
so
lightly
assume
when
*NL*
Rémi
uttered
his
final
,
unalterable
response
,
fell
from
him
like
a
*NL*
cast-off
cloak
when
he
saw
Rémi
attempt
to
make
him
abandon
hope
and
*NL*
retire
from
the
quest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
We
must
find
the
lady
.
It
is
most
*NL*
important
.
She
would
be
extremely
put
out
--
it
's
a
business
matter
--
and
*NL*
vexed
with
me
if
she
did
n't
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
not
see
how
the
lady
can
be
vexed
,
sir
,
''
answered
Rémi
,
``
since
*NL*
it
was
she
that
went
away
without
waiting
for
you
,
sir
,
and
said
she
was
*NL*
going
to
Prévost
's
,
and
then
was
n't
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
restaurants
were
closing
,
and
their
lights
began
to
go
*NL*
out
.
Under
the
trees
of
the
boulevards
there
were
still
a
few
people
*NL*
strolling
to
and
fro
,
barely
distinguishable
in
the
gathering
darkness
.
*NL*
Now
and
then
the
ghost
of
a
woman
glided
up
to
Swann
,
murmured
a
few
*NL*
words
in
his
ear
,
asked
him
to
take
her
home
,
and
left
him
shuddering
.
*NL*
Anxiously
he
explored
every
one
of
these
vaguely
seen
shapes
,
as
though
*NL*
among
the
phantoms
of
the
dead
,
in
the
realms
of
darkness
,
he
had
been
*NL*
searching
for
a
lost
Eurydice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
all
the
methods
by
which
love
is
brought
into
being
,
among
all
the
*NL*
agents
which
disseminate
that
blessed
bane
,
there
are
few
so
efficacious
*NL*
as
the
great
gust
of
agitation
which
,
now
and
then
,
sweeps
over
the
*NL*
human
spirit
.
For
then
the
creature
in
whose
company
we
are
seeking
*NL*
amusement
at
the
moment
,
her
lot
is
cast
,
her
fate
and
ours
decided
,
*NL*
that
is
the
creature
whom
we
shall
henceforward
love
.
It
is
not
*NL*
necessary
that
she
should
have
pleased
us
,
up
till
then
,
any
more
,
or
*NL*
even
as
much
as
others
.
All
that
is
necessary
is
that
our
taste
for
her
*NL*
should
become
exclusive
.
And
that
condition
is
fulfilled
so
soon
as
--
in
*NL*
the
moment
when
she
has
failed
to
meet
us
--
for
the
pleasure
which
*NL*
we
were
on
the
point
of
enjoying
in
her
charming
company
is
abruptly
*NL*
substituted
an
anxious
torturing
desire
,
whose
object
is
the
creature
*NL*
herself
,
an
irrational
,
absurd
desire
,
which
the
laws
of
civilised
*NL*
society
make
it
impossible
to
satisfy
and
difficult
to
assuage
--
the
*NL*
insensate
,
agonising
desire
to
possess
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
made
Rémi
drive
him
to
such
restaurants
as
were
still
open
;
it
was
*NL*
the
sole
hypothesis
,
now
,
of
that
happiness
which
he
had
contemplated
*NL*
so
calmly
;
he
no
longer
concealed
his
agitation
,
the
price
he
set
upon
*NL*
their
meeting
,
and
promised
,
in
case
of
success
,
to
reward
his
coachman
,
*NL*
as
though
,
by
inspiring
in
him
a
will
to
triumph
which
would
reinforce
*NL*
his
own
,
he
could
bring
it
to
pass
,
by
a
miracle
,
that
Odette
--
assuming
*NL*
that
she
had
long
since
gone
home
to
bed
,
--
might
yet
be
found
seated
in
*NL*
some
restaurant
on
the
boulevards
.
He
pursued
the
quest
as
far
as
the
*NL*
Maison
Dorée
,
burst
twice
into
Tortoni
's
and
,
still
without
catching
*NL*
sight
of
her
,
was
emerging
from
the
Café
Anglais
,
striding
with
haggard
*NL*
gaze
towards
his
carriage
,
which
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
the
Boulevard
des
Italiens
,
when
he
collided
with
a
person
coming
in
the
*NL*
opposite
direction
;
it
was
Odette
;
she
explained
,
later
,
that
there
had
*NL*
been
no
room
at
Prévost
's
,
that
she
had
gone
,
instead
,
to
sup
at
the
*NL*
Maison
Dorée
,
and
had
been
sitting
there
in
an
alcove
where
he
must
have
*NL*
overlooked
her
,
and
that
she
was
now
looking
for
her
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
so
little
expected
to
see
him
that
she
started
back
in
alarm
.
As
*NL*
for
him
,
he
had
ransacked
the
streets
of
Paris
,
not
that
he
supposed
*NL*
it
possible
that
he
should
find
her
,
but
because
he
would
have
suffered
*NL*
even
more
cruelly
by
abandoning
the
attempt
.
But
now
the
joy
-LRB-
which
,
his
*NL*
reason
had
never
ceased
to
assure
him
,
was
not
,
that
evening
at
least
,
*NL*
to
be
realised
-RRB-
was
suddenly
apparent
,
and
more
real
than
ever
*NL*
before
;
for
he
himself
had
contributed
nothing
to
it
by
anticipating
*NL*
probabilities
,
--
it
remained
integral
and
external
to
himself
;
there
*NL*
was
no
need
for
him
to
draw
on
his
own
resources
to
endow
it
with
*NL*
truth
--
't
was
from
itself
that
there
emanated
,
't
was
itself
that
*NL*
projected
towards
him
that
truth
whose
glorious
rays
melted
and
*NL*
scattered
like
the
cloud
of
a
dream
the
sense
of
loneliness
which
had
*NL*
lowered
over
him
,
that
truth
upon
which
he
had
supported
,
nay
founded
,
*NL*
albeit
unconsciously
,
his
vision
of
bliss
.
So
will
a
traveller
,
who
has
*NL*
come
down
,
on
a
day
of
glorious
weather
,
to
the
Mediterranean
shore
,
and
*NL*
is
doubtful
whether
they
still
exist
,
those
lands
which
he
has
left
,
let
*NL*
his
eyes
be
dazzled
,
rather
than
cast
a
backward
glance
,
by
the
radiance
*NL*
streaming
towards
him
from
the
luminous
and
unfading
azure
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
climbed
after
her
into
the
carriage
which
she
had
kept
waiting
,
and
*NL*
ordered
his
own
to
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
in
her
hand
a
bunch
of
cattleyas
,
and
Swann
could
see
,
beneath
*NL*
the
film
of
lace
that
covered
her
head
,
more
of
the
same
flowers
*NL*
fastened
to
a
swansdown
plume
.
She
was
wearing
,
under
her
cloak
,
a
*NL*
flowing
gown
of
black
velvet
,
caught
up
on
one
side
so
as
to
reveal
a
*NL*
large
triangular
patch
of
her
white
silk
skirt
,
with
an
`
insertion
,
'
*NL*
also
of
white
silk
,
in
the
cleft
of
her
low-necked
bodice
,
in
which
were
*NL*
fastened
a
few
more
cattleyas
.
She
had
scarcely
recovered
from
the
shock
*NL*
which
the
sight
of
Swann
had
given
her
,
when
some
obstacle
made
the
*NL*
horse
start
to
one
side
.
They
were
thrown
forward
from
their
seats
;
she
*NL*
uttered
a
cry
,
and
fell
back
quivering
and
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
''
he
assured
her
,
``
do
n't
be
frightened
.
''
And
he
slipped
*NL*
his
arm
round
her
shoulder
,
supporting
her
body
against
his
own
;
then
*NL*
went
on
:
``
Whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
utter
a
word
;
just
make
a
sign
,
yes
*NL*
or
no
,
or
you
'll
be
out
of
breath
again
.
You
wo
n't
mind
if
I
put
the
*NL*
flowers
straight
on
your
bodice
;
the
jolt
has
loosened
them
.
I
'm
afraid
*NL*
of
their
dropping
out
;
I
'm
just
going
to
fasten
them
a
little
more
*NL*
securely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
used
to
being
treated
with
so
much
formality
by
men
,
and
*NL*
smiled
as
she
answered
:
``
No
,
not
at
all
;
I
do
n't
mind
in
the
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
,
chilled
a
little
by
her
answer
,
perhaps
,
also
,
to
bear
out
the
*NL*
pretence
that
he
had
been
sincere
in
adopting
the
stratagem
,
or
even
*NL*
because
he
was
already
beginning
to
believe
that
he
had
been
,
exclaimed
:
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
you
must
n't
speak
.
You
will
be
out
of
breath
again
.
You
can
*NL*
easily
answer
in
signs
;
I
shall
understand
.
Really
and
truly
now
,
you
*NL*
do
n't
mind
my
doing
this
?
Look
,
there
is
a
little
--
I
think
it
must
be
*NL*
pollen
,
spilt
over
your
dress
,
--
may
I
brush
it
off
with
my
hand
?
That
's
*NL*
not
too
hard
;
I
'm
not
hurting
you
,
am
I
?
I
'm
tickling
you
,
perhaps
,
a
*NL*
little
;
but
I
do
n't
want
to
touch
the
velvet
in
case
I
rub
it
the
wrong
*NL*
way
.
But
,
do
n't
you
see
,
I
really
had
to
fasten
the
flowers
;
they
would
*NL*
have
fallen
out
if
I
had
n't
.
Like
that
,
now
;
if
I
just
push
them
a
*NL*
little
farther
down
...
Seriously
,
I
'm
not
annoying
you
,
am
I
?
And
if
*NL*
I
just
sniff
them
to
see
whether
they
've
really
lost
all
their
scent
?
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
I
ever
smelt
any
before
;
may
I
?
Tell
the
truth
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
smiling
,
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
ever
so
slightly
,
as
who
*NL*
should
say
,
``
You
're
quite
mad
;
you
know
very
well
that
I
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
slipped
his
other
hand
upwards
along
Odette
's
cheek
;
she
fixed
her
*NL*
eyes
on
him
with
that
languishing
and
solemn
air
which
marks
the
women
*NL*
of
the
old
Florentine
's
paintings
,
in
whose
faces
he
had
found
the
type
*NL*
of
hers
;
swimming
at
the
brink
of
her
fringed
lids
,
her
brilliant
eyes
,
*NL*
large
and
finely
drawn
as
theirs
,
seemed
on
the
verge
of
breaking
from
*NL*
her
face
and
rolling
down
her
cheeks
like
two
great
tears
.
She
bent
her
*NL*
neck
,
as
all
their
necks
may
be
seen
to
bend
,
in
the
pagan
scenes
as
*NL*
well
as
in
the
scriptural
.
And
although
her
attitude
was
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
habitual
and
instinctive
,
one
which
she
knew
to
be
appropriate
to
such
*NL*
moments
,
and
was
careful
not
to
forget
to
assume
,
she
seemed
to
need
all
*NL*
her
strength
to
hold
her
face
back
,
as
though
some
invisible
force
*NL*
were
drawing
it
down
towards
Swann
's
.
And
Swann
it
was
who
,
before
she
*NL*
allowed
her
face
,
as
though
despite
her
efforts
,
to
fall
upon
his
lips
,
*NL*
held
it
back
for
a
moment
longer
,
at
a
little
distance
between
his
*NL*
hands
.
He
had
intended
to
leave
time
for
her
mind
to
overtake
her
body
's
*NL*
movements
,
to
recognise
the
dream
which
she
had
so
long
cherished
and
to
*NL*
assist
at
its
realisation
,
like
a
mother
invited
as
a
spectator
when
*NL*
a
prize
is
given
to
the
child
whom
she
has
reared
and
loves
.
Perhaps
,
*NL*
moreover
,
Swann
himself
was
fixing
upon
these
features
of
an
Odette
not
*NL*
yet
possessed
,
not
even
kissed
by
him
,
on
whom
he
was
looking
now
for
*NL*
the
last
time
,
that
comprehensive
gaze
with
which
,
on
the
day
of
his
*NL*
departure
,
a
traveller
strives
to
bear
away
with
him
in
memory
the
view
*NL*
of
a
country
to
which
he
may
never
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
so
shy
in
approaching
her
that
,
after
this
evening
which
*NL*
had
begun
by
his
arranging
her
cattleyas
and
had
ended
in
her
complete
*NL*
surrender
,
whether
from
fear
of
chilling
her
,
or
from
reluctance
to
*NL*
appear
,
even
retrospectively
,
to
have
lied
,
or
perhaps
because
he
lacked
*NL*
the
audacity
to
formulate
a
more
urgent
requirement
than
this
-LRB-
which
*NL*
could
always
be
repeated
,
since
it
had
not
annoyed
her
on
the
first
*NL*
occasion
-RRB-
,
he
resorted
to
the
same
pretext
on
the
following
days
.
If
*NL*
she
had
any
cattleyas
pinned
to
her
bodice
,
he
would
say
:
``
It
is
most
*NL*
unfortunate
;
the
cattleyas
do
n't
need
tucking
in
this
evening
;
they
've
*NL*
not
been
disturbed
as
they
were
the
other
night
;
I
think
,
though
,
that
*NL*
this
one
is
n't
quite
straight
.
May
I
see
if
they
have
more
scent
than
*NL*
the
others
?
''
Or
else
,
if
she
had
none
:
``
Oh
!
no
cattleyas
this
evening
;
*NL*
then
there
's
nothing
for
me
to
arrange
.
''
So
that
for
some
time
there
*NL*
was
no
change
from
the
procedure
which
he
had
followed
on
that
first
*NL*
evening
,
when
he
had
started
by
touching
her
throat
,
with
his
fingers
*NL*
first
and
then
with
his
lips
,
but
their
caresses
began
invariably
with
*NL*
this
modest
exploration
.
And
long
afterwards
,
when
the
arrangement
-LRB-
or
,
*NL*
rather
,
the
ritual
pretence
of
an
arrangement
-RRB-
of
her
cattleyas
had
*NL*
quite
fallen
into
desuetude
,
the
metaphor
``
Do
a
cattleya
,
''
transmuted
*NL*
into
a
simple
verb
which
they
would
employ
without
a
thought
of
its
*NL*
original
meaning
when
they
wished
to
refer
to
the
act
of
physical
*NL*
possession
-LRB-
in
which
,
paradoxically
,
the
possessor
possesses
nothing
-RRB-
,
*NL*
survived
to
commemorate
in
their
vocabulary
the
long
forgotten
custom
*NL*
from
which
it
sprang
.
And
yet
possibly
this
particular
manner
of
saying
*NL*
``
to
make
love
''
had
not
the
precise
significance
of
its
synonyms
.
*NL*
However
disillusioned
we
may
be
about
women
,
however
we
may
regard
*NL*
the
possession
of
even
the
most
divergent
types
as
an
invariable
*NL*
and
monotonous
experience
,
every
detail
of
which
is
known
and
can
be
*NL*
described
in
advance
,
it
still
becomes
a
fresh
and
stimulating
pleasure
*NL*
if
the
women
concerned
be
--
or
be
thought
to
be
--
so
difficult
as
to
*NL*
oblige
us
to
base
our
attack
upon
some
unrehearsed
incident
in
our
*NL*
relations
with
them
,
as
was
originally
for
Swann
the
arrangement
of
the
*NL*
cattleyas
.
He
trembled
as
he
hoped
,
that
evening
,
-LRB-
but
Odette
,
he
told
*NL*
himself
,
if
she
were
deceived
by
his
stratagem
,
could
not
guess
his
*NL*
intention
-RRB-
that
it
was
the
possession
of
this
woman
that
would
emerge
*NL*
for
him
from
their
large
and
richly
coloured
petals
;
and
the
pleasure
*NL*
which
he
already
felt
,
and
which
Odette
tolerated
,
he
thought
,
perhaps
*NL*
only
because
she
was
not
yet
aware
of
it
herself
,
seemed
to
him
for
that
*NL*
reason
--
as
it
might
have
seemed
to
the
first
man
when
he
enjoyed
it
amid
*NL*
the
flowers
of
the
earthly
paradise
--
a
pleasure
which
had
never
before
*NL*
existed
,
which
he
was
striving
now
to
create
,
a
pleasure
--
and
the
*NL*
special
name
which
he
was
to
give
to
it
preserved
its
identity
--
entirely
*NL*
individual
and
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ice
once
broken
,
every
evening
,
when
he
had
taken
her
home
,
he
must
*NL*
follow
her
into
the
house
;
and
often
she
would
come
out
again
in
her
*NL*
dressing-gown
,
and
escort
him
to
his
carriage
,
and
would
kiss
him
before
*NL*
the
eyes
of
his
coachman
,
saying
:
``
What
on
earth
does
it
matter
what
*NL*
people
see
?
''
And
on
evenings
when
he
did
not
go
to
the
Verdurins
'
-LRB-
which
*NL*
happened
occasionally
,
now
that
he
had
opportunities
of
meeting
Odette
*NL*
elsewhere
-RRB-
,
when
--
more
and
more
rarely
--
he
went
into
society
,
she
would
*NL*
beg
him
to
come
to
her
on
his
way
home
,
however
late
he
might
be
.
The
*NL*
season
was
spring
,
the
nights
clear
and
frosty
.
He
would
come
away
from
*NL*
an
evening
party
,
jump
into
his
victoria
,
spread
a
rug
over
his
knees
,
*NL*
tell
the
friends
who
were
leaving
at
the
same
time
,
and
who
insisted
on
*NL*
his
going
home
with
them
,
that
he
could
not
,
that
he
was
not
going
*NL*
in
their
direction
;
then
the
coachman
would
start
off
at
a
fast
trot
*NL*
without
further
orders
,
knowing
quite
well
where
he
had
to
go
.
His
*NL*
friends
would
be
left
marvelling
,
and
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
Swann
was
*NL*
no
longer
the
same
man
.
No
one
ever
received
a
letter
from
him
now
*NL*
demanding
an
introduction
to
a
woman
.
He
had
ceased
to
pay
any
attention
*NL*
to
women
,
and
kept
away
from
the
places
in
which
they
were
ordinarily
to
*NL*
be
met
.
In
a
restaurant
,
or
in
the
country
,
his
manner
was
deliberately
*NL*
and
directly
the
opposite
of
that
by
which
,
only
a
few
days
earlier
,
*NL*
his
friends
would
have
recognised
him
,
that
manner
which
had
seemed
*NL*
permanently
and
unalterably
his
own
.
To
such
an
extent
does
passion
*NL*
manifest
itself
in
us
as
a
temporary
and
distinct
character
,
which
not
*NL*
only
takes
the
place
of
our
normal
character
but
actually
obliterates
*NL*
the
signs
by
which
that
character
has
hitherto
been
discernible
.
On
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
there
was
one
thing
that
was
,
now
,
invariable
,
namely
that
*NL*
wherever
Swann
might
be
spending
the
evening
,
he
never
failed
to
go
on
*NL*
afterwards
to
Odette
.
The
interval
of
space
separating
her
from
him
*NL*
was
one
which
he
must
as
inevitably
traverse
as
he
must
descend
,
by
an
*NL*
irresistible
gravitation
,
the
steep
slope
of
life
itself
.
To
be
frank
,
*NL*
as
often
as
not
,
when
he
had
stayed
late
at
a
party
,
he
would
have
*NL*
preferred
to
return
home
at
once
,
without
going
so
far
out
of
his
way
,
*NL*
and
to
postpone
their
meeting
until
the
morrow
;
but
the
very
fact
of
his
*NL*
putting
himself
to
such
inconvenience
at
an
abnormal
hour
in
order
to
*NL*
visit
her
,
while
he
guessed
that
his
friends
,
as
he
left
them
,
were
*NL*
saying
to
one
another
:
``
He
is
tied
hand
and
foot
;
there
must
certainly
*NL*
be
a
woman
somewhere
who
insists
on
his
going
to
her
at
all
hours
,
''
*NL*
made
him
feel
that
he
was
leading
the
life
of
the
class
of
men
whose
*NL*
existence
is
coloured
by
a
love-affair
,
and
in
whom
the
perpetual
*NL*
sacrifice
which
they
are
making
of
their
comfort
and
of
their
practical
*NL*
interests
has
engendered
a
spiritual
charm
.
Then
,
though
he
may
not
*NL*
consciously
have
taken
this
into
consideration
,
the
certainty
that
she
*NL*
was
waiting
for
him
,
that
she
was
not
anywhere
or
with
anyone
else
,
that
*NL*
he
would
see
her
before
he
went
home
,
drew
the
sting
from
that
anguish
,
*NL*
forgotten
,
it
is
true
,
but
latent
and
ever
ready
to
be
reawakened
,
which
*NL*
he
had
felt
on
the
evening
when
Odette
had
left
the
Verdurins
'
before
*NL*
his
arrival
,
an
anguish
the
actual
cessation
of
which
was
so
agreeable
*NL*
that
it
might
even
be
called
a
state
of
happiness
.
Perhaps
it
was
to
*NL*
that
hour
of
anguish
that
there
must
be
attributed
the
importance
which
*NL*
Odette
had
since
assumed
in
his
life
.
Other
people
are
,
as
a
rule
,
so
*NL*
immaterial
to
us
that
,
when
we
have
entrusted
to
any
one
of
them
the
*NL*
power
to
cause
so
much
suffering
or
happiness
to
ourselves
,
that
person
*NL*
seems
at
once
to
belong
to
a
different
universe
,
is
surrounded
with
*NL*
poetry
,
makes
of
our
lives
a
vast
expanse
,
quick
with
sensation
,
on
*NL*
which
that
person
and
ourselves
are
ever
more
or
less
in
contact
.
Swann
*NL*
could
not
without
anxiety
ask
himself
what
Odette
would
mean
to
him
*NL*
in
the
years
that
were
to
come
.
Sometimes
,
as
he
looked
up
from
his
*NL*
victoria
on
those
fine
and
frosty
nights
of
early
spring
,
and
saw
the
*NL*
dazzling
moonbeams
fall
between
his
eyes
and
the
deserted
streets
,
he
*NL*
would
think
of
that
other
face
,
gleaming
and
faintly
roseate
like
the
*NL*
moon
's
,
which
had
,
one
day
,
risen
on
the
horizon
of
his
mind
and
since
*NL*
then
had
shed
upon
the
world
that
mysterious
light
in
which
he
saw
it
*NL*
bathed
.
If
he
arrived
after
the
hour
at
which
Odette
sent
her
servants
*NL*
to
bed
,
before
ringing
the
bell
at
the
gate
of
her
little
garden
,
*NL*
he
would
go
round
first
into
the
other
street
,
over
which
,
at
the
*NL*
ground-level
,
among
the
windows
-LRB-
all
exactly
alike
,
but
darkened
-RRB-
of
*NL*
the
adjoining
houses
,
shone
the
solitary
lighted
window
of
her
room
.
*NL*
He
would
rap
upon
the
pane
,
and
she
would
hear
the
signal
,
and
answer
,
*NL*
before
running
to
meet
him
at
the
gate
.
He
would
find
,
lying
open
on
the
*NL*
piano
,
some
of
her
favourite
music
,
the
_
Valse
des
Roses
_
,
the
_
Pauvre
*NL*
Fou
_
of
Tagliafico
-LRB-
which
,
according
to
the
instructions
embodied
in
her
*NL*
will
,
was
to
be
played
at
her
funeral
-RRB-
;
but
he
would
ask
her
,
instead
,
*NL*
to
give
him
the
little
phrase
from
Vinteuil
's
sonata
.
It
was
true
that
*NL*
Odette
played
vilely
,
but
often
the
fairest
impression
that
remains
in
*NL*
our
minds
of
a
favourite
air
is
one
which
has
arisen
out
of
a
jumble
*NL*
of
wrong
notes
struck
by
unskilful
fingers
upon
a
tuneless
piano
.
The
*NL*
little
phrase
was
associated
still
,
in
Swann
's
mind
,
with
his
love
for
*NL*
Odette
.
He
felt
clearly
that
this
love
was
something
to
which
there
were
*NL*
no
corresponding
external
signs
,
whose
meaning
could
not
be
proved
by
*NL*
any
but
himself
;
he
realised
,
too
,
that
Odette
's
qualities
were
not
such
*NL*
as
to
justify
his
setting
so
high
a
value
on
the
hours
he
spent
in
*NL*
her
company
.
And
often
,
when
the
cold
government
of
reason
stood
*NL*
unchallenged
,
he
would
readily
have
ceased
to
sacrifice
so
many
of
his
*NL*
intellectual
and
social
interests
to
this
imaginary
pleasure
.
But
the
*NL*
little
phrase
,
as
soon
as
it
struck
his
ear
,
had
the
power
to
liberate
*NL*
in
him
the
room
that
was
needed
to
contain
it
;
the
proportions
of
*NL*
Swann
's
soul
were
altered
;
a
margin
was
left
for
a
form
of
enjoyment
*NL*
which
corresponded
no
more
than
his
love
for
Odette
to
any
external
*NL*
object
,
and
yet
was
not
,
like
his
enjoyment
of
that
love
,
purely
*NL*
individual
,
but
assumed
for
him
an
objective
reality
superior
to
that
*NL*
of
other
concrete
things
.
This
thirst
for
an
untasted
charm
,
the
little
*NL*
phrase
would
stimulate
it
anew
in
him
,
but
without
bringing
him
any
*NL*
definite
gratification
to
assuage
it
.
With
the
result
that
those
parts
*NL*
of
Swann
's
soul
in
which
the
little
phrase
had
obliterated
all
care
*NL*
for
material
interests
,
those
human
considerations
which
affect
all
men
*NL*
alike
,
were
left
bare
by
it
,
blank
pages
on
which
he
was
at
liberty
to
*NL*
inscribe
the
name
of
Odette
.
Moreover
,
where
Odette
's
affection
might
*NL*
seem
ever
so
little
abrupt
and
disappointing
,
the
little
phrase
would
*NL*
come
to
supplement
it
,
to
amalgamate
with
it
its
own
mysterious
essence
.
*NL*
Watching
Swann
's
face
while
he
listened
to
the
phrase
,
one
would
have
*NL*
said
that
he
was
inhaling
an
anaesthetic
which
allowed
him
to
breathe
*NL*
more
deeply
.
And
the
pleasure
which
the
music
gave
him
,
which
was
*NL*
shortly
to
create
in
him
a
real
longing
,
was
in
fact
closely
akin
,
*NL*
at
such
moments
,
to
the
pleasure
which
he
would
have
derived
from
*NL*
experimenting
with
perfumes
,
from
entering
into
contract
with
a
world
*NL*
for
which
we
men
were
not
created
,
which
appears
to
lack
form
because
*NL*
our
eyes
can
not
perceive
it
,
to
lack
significance
because
it
escapes
*NL*
our
intelligence
,
to
which
we
may
attain
by
way
of
one
sense
only
.
Deep
*NL*
repose
,
mysterious
refreshment
for
Swann
,
--
for
him
whose
eyes
,
although
*NL*
delicate
interpreters
of
painting
,
whose
mind
,
although
an
acute
*NL*
observer
of
manners
,
must
bear
for
ever
the
indelible
imprint
of
the
*NL*
barrenness
of
his
life
,
--
to
feel
himself
transformed
into
a
creature
*NL*
foreign
to
humanity
,
blinded
,
deprived
of
his
logical
faculty
,
almost
*NL*
a
fantastic
unicorn
,
a
chimaera-like
creature
conscious
of
the
world
*NL*
through
his
two
ears
alone
.
And
as
,
notwithstanding
,
he
sought
in
the
*NL*
little
phrase
for
a
meaning
to
which
his
intelligence
could
not
descend
,
*NL*
with
what
a
strange
frenzy
of
intoxication
must
he
strip
bare
his
*NL*
innermost
soul
of
the
whole
armour
of
reason
,
and
make
it
pass
,
*NL*
unattended
,
through
the
straining
vessel
,
down
into
the
dark
filter
of
*NL*
sound
.
He
began
to
reckon
up
how
much
that
was
painful
,
perhaps
even
how
*NL*
much
secret
and
unappeased
sorrow
underlay
the
sweetness
of
the
phrase
;
*NL*
and
yet
to
him
it
brought
no
suffering
.
What
matter
though
the
phrase
*NL*
repeated
that
love
is
frail
and
fleeting
,
when
his
love
was
so
strong
!
*NL*
He
played
with
the
melancholy
which
the
phrase
diffused
,
he
felt
it
*NL*
stealing
over
him
,
but
like
a
caress
which
only
deepened
and
sweetened
*NL*
his
sense
of
his
own
happiness
.
He
would
make
Odette
play
him
the
phrase
*NL*
again
,
ten
,
twenty
times
on
end
,
insisting
that
,
while
she
played
,
she
*NL*
must
never
cease
to
kiss
him
.
Every
kiss
provokes
another
.
Ah
,
in
those
*NL*
earliest
days
of
love
how
naturally
the
kisses
spring
into
life
.
How
*NL*
closely
,
in
their
abundance
,
are
they
pressed
one
against
another
;
until
*NL*
lovers
would
find
it
as
hard
to
count
the
kisses
exchanged
in
an
hour
,
*NL*
as
to
count
the
flowers
in
a
meadow
in
May
.
Then
she
would
pretend
to
*NL*
stop
,
saying
:
``
How
do
you
expect
me
to
play
when
you
keep
on
holding
me
?
*NL*
I
ca
n't
do
everything
at
once
.
Make
up
your
mind
what
you
want
;
am
I
to
*NL*
play
the
phrase
or
do
you
want
to
play
with
me
?
''
Then
he
would
become
*NL*
annoyed
,
and
she
would
burst
out
with
a
laugh
which
,
was
transformed
,
as
*NL*
it
left
her
lips
,
and
descended
upon
him
in
a
shower
of
kisses
.
Or
else
*NL*
she
would
look
at
him
sulkily
,
and
he
would
see
once
again
a
face
worthy
*NL*
to
figure
in
Botticelli
's
`
Life
of
Moses
,
'
he
would
place
it
there
,
*NL*
giving
to
Odette
's
neck
the
necessary
inclination
;
and
when
he
had
*NL*
finished
her
portrait
in
distemper
,
in
the
fifteenth
century
,
on
the
*NL*
wall
of
the
Sixtine
,
the
idea
that
she
was
,
none
the
less
,
in
the
room
*NL*
with
him
still
,
by
the
piano
,
at
that
very
moment
,
ready
to
be
kissed
*NL*
and
won
,
the
idea
of
her
material
existence
,
of
her
being
alive
,
would
*NL*
sweep
over
him
with
so
violent
an
intoxication
that
,
with
eyes
starting
*NL*
from
his
head
and
jaws
that
parted
as
though
to
devour
her
,
he
would
*NL*
fling
himself
upon
this
Botticelli
maiden
and
kiss
and
bite
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
And
then
,
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
house
,
not
without
returning
to
*NL*
kiss
her
once
again
,
because
he
had
forgotten
to
take
away
with
him
,
in
*NL*
memory
,
some
detail
of
her
fragrance
or
of
her
features
,
while
he
drove
*NL*
home
in
his
victoria
,
blessing
the
name
of
Odette
who
allowed
him
to
pay
*NL*
her
these
daily
visits
,
which
,
although
they
could
not
,
he
felt
,
bring
*NL*
any
great
happiness
to
her
,
still
,
by
keeping
him
immune
from
the
fever
*NL*
of
jealousy
--
by
removing
from
him
every
possibility
of
a
fresh
outbreak
*NL*
of
the
heart-sickness
which
had
manifested
itself
in
him
that
evening
,
*NL*
when
he
had
failed
to
find
her
at
the
Verdurins
'
--
might
help
him
to
*NL*
arrive
,
without
any
recurrence
of
those
crises
,
of
which
the
first
had
*NL*
been
so
distressing
that
it
must
also
be
the
last
,
at
the
termination
of
*NL*
this
strange
series
of
hours
in
his
life
,
hours
almost
enchanted
,
in
the
*NL*
same
manner
as
these
other
,
following
hours
,
in
which
he
drove
through
a
*NL*
deserted
Paris
by
the
light
of
the
moon
:
noticing
as
he
drove
home
that
*NL*
the
satellite
had
now
changed
its
position
,
relatively
to
his
own
,
*NL*
and
was
almost
touching
the
horizon
;
feeling
that
his
love
,
also
,
was
*NL*
obedient
to
these
immutable
laws
of
nature
,
he
asked
himself
whether
*NL*
this
period
,
upon
which
he
had
entered
,
was
to
last
much
longer
,
whether
*NL*
presently
his
mind
's
eye
would
cease
to
behold
that
dear
countenance
,
*NL*
save
as
occupying
a
distant
and
diminished
position
,
and
on
the
verge
of
*NL*
ceasing
to
shed
on
him
the
radiance
of
its
charm
.
For
Swann
was
finding
*NL*
in
things
once
more
,
since
he
had
fallen
in
love
,
the
charm
that
he
had
*NL*
found
when
,
in
his
adolescence
,
he
had
fancied
himself
an
artist
;
with
*NL*
this
difference
,
that
what
charm
lay
in
them
now
was
conferred
by
Odette
*NL*
alone
.
He
could
feel
reawakening
in
himself
the
inspirations
of
his
*NL*
boyhood
,
which
had
been
dissipated
among
the
frivolities
of
his
later
*NL*
life
,
but
they
all
bore
,
now
,
the
reflection
,
the
stamp
of
a
particular
*NL*
being
;
and
during
the
long
hours
which
he
now
found
a
subtle
pleasure
*NL*
in
spending
at
home
,
alone
with
his
convalescent
spirit
,
he
became
*NL*
gradually
himself
again
,
but
himself
in
thraldom
to
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
her
only
in
the
evenings
,
and
knew
nothing
of
how
she
spent
*NL*
her
time
during
the
day
,
any
more
than
he
knew
of
her
past
;
so
little
,
*NL*
indeed
,
that
he
had
not
even
the
tiny
,
initial
clue
which
,
by
allowing
*NL*
us
to
imagine
what
we
do
not
know
,
stimulates
a
desire
for
knowledge
.
*NL*
And
so
he
never
asked
himself
what
she
might
be
doing
,
or
what
her
life
*NL*
had
been
.
Only
he
smiled
sometimes
at
the
thought
of
how
,
some
years
*NL*
earlier
,
when
he
still
did
not
know
her
,
some
one
had
spoken
to
him
of
a
*NL*
woman
who
,
if
he
remembered
rightly
,
must
certainly
have
been
Odette
,
*NL*
as
of
a
`
tart
,
'
a
`
kept
'
woman
,
one
of
those
women
to
whom
he
still
*NL*
attributed
-LRB-
having
lived
but
little
in
their
company
-RRB-
the
entire
set
of
*NL*
characteristics
,
fundamentally
perverse
,
with
which
they
had
been
,
for
*NL*
many
years
,
endowed
by
the
imagination
of
certain
novelists
.
He
would
*NL*
say
to
himself
that
one
has
,
as
often
as
not
,
only
to
take
the
exact
*NL*
counterpart
of
the
reputation
created
by
the
world
in
order
to
judge
a
*NL*
person
fairly
,
when
with
such
a
character
he
contrasted
that
of
Odette
,
*NL*
so
good
,
so
simple
,
so
enthusiastic
in
the
pursuit
of
ideals
,
so
nearly
*NL*
incapable
of
not
telling
the
truth
that
,
when
he
had
once
begged
her
,
so
*NL*
that
they
might
dine
together
alone
,
to
write
to
Mme.
Verdurin
,
saying
*NL*
that
she
was
unwell
,
the
next
day
he
had
seen
her
,
face
to
face
*NL*
with
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
asked
whether
she
had
recovered
,
blushing
,
*NL*
stammering
,
and
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
revealing
in
every
feature
how
*NL*
painful
,
what
a
torture
it
was
to
her
to
act
a
lie
;
and
,
while
in
her
*NL*
answer
she
multiplied
the
fictitious
details
of
an
imaginary
illness
,
*NL*
seeming
to
ask
pardon
,
by
her
suppliant
look
and
her
stricken
accents
,
*NL*
for
the
obvious
falsehood
of
her
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
certain
days
,
however
,
though
these
came
seldom
,
she
would
call
upon
*NL*
him
in
the
afternoon
,
to
interrupt
his
musings
or
the
essay
on
Vermeer
*NL*
to
which
he
had
latterly
returned
.
His
servant
would
come
in
to
say
that
*NL*
Mme.
de
Crécy
was
in
the
small
drawing-room
.
He
would
go
in
search
of
*NL*
her
,
and
,
when
he
opened
the
door
,
on
Odette
's
blushing
countenance
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
Swann
,
would
appear
--
changing
the
curve
*NL*
of
her
lips
,
the
look
in
her
eyes
,
the
moulding
of
her
cheeks
--
an
*NL*
all-absorbing
smile
.
Once
he
was
left
alone
he
would
see
again
that
*NL*
smile
,
and
her
smile
of
the
day
before
,
another
with
which
she
had
*NL*
greeted
him
sometime
else
,
the
smile
which
had
been
her
answer
,
in
the
*NL*
carriage
that
night
,
when
he
had
asked
her
whether
she
objected
to
his
*NL*
rearranging
her
cattleyas
;
and
the
life
of
Odette
at
all
other
times
,
*NL*
since
he
knew
nothing
of
it
,
appeared
to
him
upon
a
neutral
and
*NL*
colourless
background
,
like
those
sheets
of
sketches
by
Watteau
upon
*NL*
which
one
sees
,
here
and
there
,
in
every
corner
and
in
all
directions
,
*NL*
traced
in
three
colours
upon
the
buff
paper
,
innumerable
smiles
.
But
,
*NL*
once
in
a
while
,
illuminating
a
chink
of
that
existence
which
Swann
*NL*
still
saw
as
a
complete
blank
,
even
if
his
mind
assured
him
that
it
was
*NL*
not
so
,
because
he
was
unable
to
imagine
anything
that
might
occupy
it
,
*NL*
some
friend
who
knew
them
both
,
and
suspecting
that
they
were
in
love
,
*NL*
had
not
dared
to
tell
him
anything
about
her
that
was
of
the
least
*NL*
importance
,
would
describe
Odette
's
figure
,
as
he
had
seen
her
,
that
*NL*
very
morning
,
going
on
foot
up
the
Rue
Abbattucci
,
in
a
cape
trimmed
*NL*
with
skunks
,
wearing
a
Rembrandt
hat
,
and
a
bunch
of
violets
in
her
*NL*
bosom
.
This
simple
outline
reduced
Swann
to
utter
confusion
by
enabling
*NL*
him
suddenly
to
perceive
that
Odette
had
an
existence
which
was
not
*NL*
wholly
subordinated
to
his
own
;
he
burned
to
know
whom
she
had
been
*NL*
seeking
to
fascinate
by
this
costume
in
which
he
had
never
seen
her
;
he
*NL*
registered
a
vow
to
insist
upon
her
telling
him
where
she
had
been
going
*NL*
at
that
intercepted
moment
,
as
though
,
in
all
the
colourless
life
--
a
*NL*
life
almost
nonexistent
,
since
she
was
then
invisible
to
him
--
of
his
*NL*
mistress
,
there
had
been
but
a
single
incident
apart
from
all
those
*NL*
smiles
directed
towards
himself
;
namely
,
her
walking
abroad
beneath
a
*NL*
Rembrandt
hat
,
with
a
bunch
of
violets
in
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Except
when
he
asked
her
for
Vinteuil
's
little
phrase
instead
of
the
*NL*
_
Valse
des
Roses
_
,
Swann
made
no
effort
to
induce
her
to
play
the
things
*NL*
that
he
himself
preferred
,
nor
,
in
literature
any
more
than
in
music
,
to
*NL*
correct
the
manifold
errors
of
her
taste
.
He
fully
realised
that
she
was
*NL*
not
intelligent
.
When
she
said
how
much
she
would
like
him
to
tell
her
*NL*
about
the
great
poets
,
she
had
imagined
that
she
would
suddenly
get
*NL*
to
know
whole
pages
of
romantic
and
heroic
verse
,
in
the
style
of
the
*NL*
Vicomte
de
Borelli
,
only
even
more
moving
.
As
for
Vermeer
of
Delft
,
she
*NL*
asked
whether
he
had
been
made
to
suffer
by
a
woman
,
if
it
was
a
woman
*NL*
that
had
inspired
him
,
and
once
Swann
had
told
her
that
no
one
knew
,
she
*NL*
had
lost
all
interest
in
that
painter
.
She
would
often
say
:
``
I
'm
sure
,
*NL*
poetry
;
well
,
of
course
,
there
'd
be
nothing
like
it
if
it
was
all
true
,
*NL*
if
the
poets
really
believed
the
things
they
said
.
But
as
often
as
not
*NL*
you
'll
find
there
's
no
one
so
mean
and
calculating
as
those
fellows
.
I
*NL*
know
something
about
poetry
.
I
had
a
friend
,
once
,
who
was
in
love
with
*NL*
a
poet
of
sorts
.
In
his
verses
he
never
spoke
of
anything
but
love
,
and
*NL*
heaven
,
and
the
stars
.
Oh
!
she
was
properly
taken
in
!
He
had
more
than
*NL*
three
hundred
thousand
francs
out
of
her
before
he
'd
finished
.
''
If
,
*NL*
then
,
Swann
tried
to
shew
her
in
what
artistic
beauty
consisted
,
how
one
*NL*
ought
to
appreciate
poetry
or
painting
,
after
a
minute
or
two
she
would
*NL*
cease
to
listen
,
saying
:
``
Yes
...
I
never
thought
it
would
be
like
that
.
''
*NL*
And
he
felt
that
her
disappointment
was
so
great
that
he
preferred
to
*NL*
lie
to
her
,
assuring
her
that
what
he
had
said
was
nothing
,
that
he
*NL*
had
only
touched
the
surface
,
that
he
had
not
time
to
go
into
it
all
*NL*
properly
,
that
there
was
more
in
it
than
that
.
Then
she
would
interrupt
*NL*
with
a
brisk
,
``
More
in
it
?
What
?
...
Do
tell
me
!
''
,
but
he
did
not
tell
*NL*
her
,
for
he
realised
how
petty
it
would
appear
to
her
,
and
how
different
*NL*
from
what
she
had
expected
,
less
sensational
and
less
touching
;
he
was
*NL*
afraid
,
too
,
lest
,
disillusioned
in
the
matter
of
art
,
she
might
at
the
*NL*
same
time
be
disillusioned
in
the
greater
matter
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
result
that
she
found
Swann
inferior
,
intellectually
,
to
what
*NL*
she
had
supposed
.
``
You
're
always
so
reserved
;
I
ca
n't
make
you
out
.
''
She
*NL*
marvelled
increasingly
at
his
indifference
to
money
,
at
his
courtesy
*NL*
to
everyone
alike
,
at
the
delicacy
of
his
mind
.
And
indeed
it
happens
,
*NL*
often
enough
,
to
a
greater
man
than
Swann
ever
was
,
to
a
scientist
or
*NL*
artist
,
when
he
is
not
wholly
misunderstood
by
the
people
among
whom
*NL*
he
lives
,
that
the
feeling
in
them
which
proves
that
they
have
been
*NL*
convinced
of
the
superiority
of
his
intellect
is
created
not
by
any
*NL*
admiration
for
his
ideas
--
for
those
are
entirely
beyond
them
--
but
by
*NL*
their
respect
for
what
they
term
his
good
qualities
.
There
was
also
the
*NL*
respect
with
which
Odette
was
inspired
by
the
thought
of
Swann
's
social
*NL*
position
,
although
she
had
no
desire
that
he
should
attempt
to
secure
*NL*
invitations
for
herself
.
Perhaps
she
felt
that
such
attempts
would
be
*NL*
bound
to
fail
;
perhaps
,
indeed
,
she
feared
lest
,
merely
by
speaking
of
*NL*
her
to
his
friends
,
he
should
provoke
disclosures
of
an
unwelcome
kind
.
*NL*
The
fact
remains
that
she
had
consistently
held
him
to
his
promise
never
*NL*
to
mention
her
name
.
Her
reason
for
not
wishing
to
go
into
society
was
,
*NL*
she
had
told
him
,
a
quarrel
which
she
had
had
,
long
ago
,
with
another
*NL*
girl
,
who
had
avenged
herself
by
saying
nasty
things
about
her
.
``
But
,
''
*NL*
Swann
objected
,
``
surely
,
people
do
n't
all
know
your
friend
.
''
``
Yes
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
see
,
it
's
like
a
spot
of
oil
;
people
are
so
horrid
.
''
Swann
was
*NL*
unable
,
frankly
,
to
appreciate
this
point
;
on
the
other
hand
,
he
knew
*NL*
that
such
generalisations
as
``
People
are
so
horrid
,
''
and
``
A
word
of
*NL*
scandal
spreads
like
a
spot
of
oil
,
''
were
generally
accepted
as
true
;
*NL*
there
must
,
therefore
,
be
cases
to
which
they
were
literally
applicable
.
*NL*
Could
Odette
's
case
be
one
of
these
?
He
teased
himself
with
the
*NL*
question
,
though
not
for
long
,
for
he
too
was
subject
to
that
mental
*NL*
oppression
which
had
so
weighed
upon
his
father
,
whenever
he
was
faced
*NL*
by
a
difficult
problem
.
In
any
event
,
that
world
of
society
which
*NL*
concealed
such
terrors
for
Odette
inspired
her
,
probably
,
with
no
very
*NL*
great
longing
to
enter
it
,
since
it
was
too
far
removed
from
the
world
*NL*
which
she
already
knew
for
her
to
be
able
to
form
any
clear
conception
*NL*
of
it
.
At
the
same
time
,
while
in
certain
respects
she
had
retained
a
*NL*
genuine
simplicity
-LRB-
she
had
,
for
instance
,
kept
up
a
friendship
with
a
*NL*
little
dressmaker
,
now
retired
from
business
,
up
whose
steep
and
dark
*NL*
and
fetid
staircase
she
clambered
almost
every
day
-RRB-
,
she
still
thirsted
*NL*
to
be
in
the
fashion
,
though
her
idea
of
it
was
not
altogether
that
held
*NL*
by
fashionable
people
.
For
the
latter
,
fashion
is
a
thing
that
emanates
*NL*
from
a
comparatively
small
number
of
leaders
,
who
project
it
to
a
*NL*
considerable
distance
--
with
more
or
less
strength
according
as
one
*NL*
is
nearer
to
or
farther
from
their
intimate
centre
--
over
the
widening
*NL*
circle
of
their
friends
and
the
friends
of
their
friends
,
whose
names
*NL*
form
a
sort
of
tabulated
index
.
People
`
in
society
'
know
this
index
by
*NL*
heart
,
they
are
gifted
in
such
matters
with
an
erudition
from
which
they
*NL*
have
extracted
a
sort
of
taste
,
of
tact
,
so
automatic
in
its
operation
*NL*
that
Swann
,
for
example
,
without
needing
to
draw
upon
his
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
world
,
if
he
read
in
a
newspaper
the
names
of
the
people
who
had
*NL*
been
guests
at
a
dinner
,
could
tell
at
once
how
fashionable
the
dinner
*NL*
had
been
,
just
as
a
man
of
letters
,
merely
by
reading
a
phrase
,
can
*NL*
estimate
exactly
the
literary
merit
of
its
author
.
But
Odette
was
one
*NL*
of
those
persons
-LRB-
an
extremely
numerous
class
,
whatever
the
fashionable
*NL*
world
may
think
,
and
to
be
found
in
every
section
of
society
-RRB-
who
do
*NL*
not
share
this
knowledge
,
but
imagine
fashion
to
be
something
of
quite
*NL*
another
kind
,
which
assumes
different
aspects
according
to
the
circle
to
*NL*
which
they
themselves
belong
,
but
has
the
special
characteristic
--
common
*NL*
alike
to
the
fashion
of
which
Odette
used
to
dream
and
to
that
before
*NL*
which
Mme.
Cottard
bowed
--
of
being
directly
accessible
to
all
.
The
other
*NL*
kind
,
the
fashion
of
`
fashionable
people
,
'
is
,
it
must
be
admitted
,
*NL*
accessible
also
;
but
there
are
inevitable
delays
.
Odette
would
say
of
*NL*
some
one
:
``
He
never
goes
to
any
place
that
is
n't
really
smart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
Swann
were
to
ask
her
what
she
meant
by
that
,
she
would
answer
,
*NL*
with
a
touch
of
contempt
,
``
Smart
places
!
Why
,
good
heavens
,
just
fancy
,
*NL*
at
your
age
,
having
to
be
told
what
the
smart
places
are
in
Paris
!
What
*NL*
do
you
expect
me
to
say
?
Well
,
on
Sunday
mornings
there
's
the
Avenue
de
*NL*
l'Impératrice
,
and
round
the
lake
at
five
o'clock
,
and
on
Thursdays
*NL*
the
Eden-Théâtre
,
and
the
Hippodrome
on
Fridays
;
then
there
are
the
*NL*
balls
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
balls
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
silly
,
the
balls
people
give
in
Paris
;
the
smart
ones
,
I
mean
.
*NL*
Wait
now
,
Herbinger
,
you
know
who
I
mean
,
the
fellow
who
's
in
one
of
*NL*
the
jobbers
'
offices
;
yes
,
of
course
,
you
must
know
him
,
he
's
one
of
the
*NL*
best-known
men
in
Paris
,
that
great
big
fair-haired
boy
who
wears
*NL*
such
swagger
clothes
;
he
always
has
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
and
a
*NL*
light-coloured
overcoat
with
a
fold
down
the
back
;
he
goes
about
with
*NL*
that
old
image
,
takes
her
to
all
the
first-nights
.
Very
well
!
He
gave
*NL*
a
ball
the
other
night
,
and
all
the
smart
people
in
Paris
were
there
.
*NL*
I
should
have
loved
to
go
!
but
you
had
to
shew
your
invitation
at
the
*NL*
door
,
and
I
could
n't
get
one
anywhere
.
After
all
,
I
'm
just
as
glad
,
*NL*
now
,
that
I
did
n't
go
;
I
should
have
been
killed
in
the
crush
,
and
seen
*NL*
nothing
.
Still
,
just
to
be
able
to
say
one
had
been
to
Herbinger
's
ball
.
*NL*
You
know
how
vain
I
am
!
However
,
you
may
be
quite
certain
that
half
the
*NL*
people
who
tell
you
they
were
there
are
telling
stories
...
But
I
am
*NL*
surprised
that
you
were
n't
there
,
a
regular
`
tip-topper
'
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
made
no
attempt
,
however
,
to
modify
this
conception
of
fashion
;
*NL*
feeling
that
his
own
came
no
nearer
to
the
truth
,
was
just
as
fatuous
,
*NL*
devoid
of
all
importance
,
he
saw
no
advantage
to
be
gained
by
imparting
*NL*
it
to
his
mistress
,
with
the
result
that
,
after
a
few
months
,
she
ceased
*NL*
to
take
any
interest
in
the
people
to
whose
houses
he
went
,
except
*NL*
when
they
were
the
means
of
his
obtaining
tickets
for
the
paddock
at
*NL*
race-meetings
or
first-nights
at
the
theatre
.
She
hoped
that
he
would
*NL*
continue
to
cultivate
such
profitable
acquaintances
,
but
she
had
come
to
*NL*
regard
them
as
less
smart
since
the
day
when
she
had
passed
the
Marquise
*NL*
de
Villeparisis
in
the
street
,
wearing
a
black
serge
dress
and
a
bonnet
*NL*
with
strings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
looks
like
a
pew-opener
,
like
an
old
charwoman
,
darling
!
That
a
*NL*
marquise
!
Goodness
knows
I
'm
not
a
marquise
,
but
you
'd
have
to
pay
me
*NL*
a
lot
of
money
before
you
'd
get
me
to
go
about
Paris
rigged
out
like
*NL*
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
could
she
understand
Swann
's
continuing
to
live
in
his
house
on
the
*NL*
Quai
d'Orléans
,
which
,
though
she
dared
not
tell
him
so
,
she
considered
*NL*
unworthy
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
that
she
claimed
to
be
fond
of
`
antiques
,
'
and
used
to
*NL*
assume
a
rapturous
and
knowing
air
when
she
confessed
how
she
loved
*NL*
to
spend
the
whole
day
`
rummaging
'
in
second-hand
shops
,
hunting
for
*NL*
`
bric-à-brac
,
'
and
things
of
the
`
right
date
.
'
Although
it
was
a
point
*NL*
of
honour
,
to
which
she
obstinately
clung
,
as
though
obeying
some
old
*NL*
family
custom
,
that
she
should
never
answer
any
questions
,
never
give
*NL*
any
account
of
what
she
did
during
the
daytime
,
she
spoke
to
Swann
once
*NL*
about
a
friend
to
whose
house
she
had
been
invited
,
and
had
found
that
*NL*
everything
in
it
was
`
of
the
period
.
'
Swann
could
not
get
her
to
tell
*NL*
him
what
`
period
'
it
was
.
Only
after
thinking
the
matter
over
she
*NL*
replied
that
it
was
`
mediaeval
'
;
by
which
she
meant
that
the
walls
were
*NL*
panelled
.
Some
time
later
she
spoke
to
him
again
of
her
friend
,
and
*NL*
added
,
in
the
hesitating
but
confident
tone
in
which
one
refers
to
a
*NL*
person
whom
one
has
met
somewhere
,
at
dinner
,
the
night
before
,
of
whom
*NL*
one
had
never
heard
until
then
,
but
whom
one
's
hosts
seemed
to
regard
as
*NL*
some
one
so
celebrated
and
important
that
one
hopes
that
one
's
listener
*NL*
will
know
quite
well
who
is
meant
,
and
will
be
duly
impressed
:
``
Her
*NL*
dining-room
...
is
...
eighteenth
century
!
''
Incidentally
,
she
had
thought
*NL*
it
hideous
,
all
bare
,
as
though
the
house
were
still
unfinished
;
women
*NL*
looked
frightful
in
it
,
and
it
would
never
become
the
fashion
.
She
*NL*
mentioned
it
again
,
a
third
time
,
when
she
shewed
Swann
a
card
with
the
*NL*
name
and
address
of
the
man
who
had
designed
the
dining-room
,
and
whom
*NL*
she
wanted
to
send
for
,
when
she
had
enough
money
,
to
see
whether
he
*NL*
could
not
do
one
for
her
too
;
not
one
like
that
,
of
course
,
but
one
*NL*
of
the
sort
she
used
to
dream
of
,
one
which
,
unfortunately
,
her
little
*NL*
house
would
not
be
large
enough
to
contain
,
with
tall
sideboards
,
*NL*
Renaissance
furniture
and
fireplaces
like
the
Château
at
Blois
.
It
was
*NL*
on
this
occasion
that
she
let
out
to
Swann
what
she
really
thought
of
*NL*
his
abode
on
the
Quai
d'Orléans
;
he
having
ventured
the
criticism
that
*NL*
her
friend
had
indulged
,
not
in
the
Louis
XVI
style
,
for
,
he
went
on
,
*NL*
although
that
was
not
,
of
course
,
done
,
still
it
might
be
made
charming
,
*NL*
but
in
the
`
Sham-Antique
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
n't
have
her
live
,
like
you
,
among
a
lot
of
broken-down
chairs
*NL*
and
threadbare
carpets
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
the
innate
respectability
of
*NL*
the
middle-class
housewife
rising
impulsively
to
the
surface
through
the
*NL*
acquired
dilettantism
of
the
`
light
woman
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
People
who
enjoyed
`
picking-up
'
things
,
who
admired
poetry
,
despised
*NL*
sordid
calculations
of
profit
and
loss
,
and
nourished
ideals
of
honour
*NL*
and
love
,
she
placed
in
a
class
by
themselves
,
superior
to
the
rest
of
*NL*
humanity
.
There
was
no
need
actually
to
have
those
tastes
,
provided
*NL*
one
talked
enough
about
them
;
when
a
man
had
told
her
at
dinner
that
he
*NL*
loved
to
wander
about
and
get
his
hands
all
covered
with
dust
in
the
*NL*
old
furniture
shops
,
that
he
would
never
be
really
appreciated
in
*NL*
this
commercial
age
,
since
he
was
not
concerned
about
the
things
that
*NL*
interested
it
,
and
that
he
belonged
to
another
generation
altogether
,
*NL*
she
would
come
home
saying
:
``
Why
,
he
's
an
adorable
creature
;
so
*NL*
sensitive
!
I
had
no
idea
,
''
and
she
would
conceive
for
him
a
strong
and
*NL*
sudden
friendship
.
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
men
who
,
like
Swann
,
had
*NL*
these
tastes
but
did
not
speak
of
them
,
left
her
cold
.
She
was
obliged
,
*NL*
of
course
,
to
admit
that
Swann
was
most
generous
with
his
money
,
but
she
*NL*
would
add
,
pouting
:
``
It
's
not
the
same
thing
,
you
see
,
with
him
,
''
*NL*
and
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
what
appealed
to
her
imagination
was
not
the
*NL*
practice
of
disinterestedness
,
but
its
vocabulary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
that
,
often
,
he
could
not
give
her
in
reality
the
pleasures
of
*NL*
which
she
dreamed
,
he
tried
at
least
to
ensure
that
she
should
be
happy
*NL*
in
his
company
,
tried
not
to
contradict
those
vulgar
ideas
,
that
bad
*NL*
taste
which
she
displayed
on
every
possible
occasion
,
which
all
the
same
*NL*
he
loved
,
as
he
could
not
help
loving
everything
that
came
from
her
,
*NL*
which
even
fascinated
him
,
for
were
they
not
so
many
more
of
those
*NL*
characteristic
features
,
by
virtue
of
which
the
essential
qualities
*NL*
of
the
woman
emerged
,
and
were
made
visible
?
And
so
,
when
she
was
in
a
*NL*
happy
mood
because
she
was
going
to
see
the
_
Reine
Topaze
_
,
or
when
her
*NL*
eyes
grew
serious
,
troubled
,
petulant
,
if
she
was
afraid
of
missing
the
*NL*
flower-show
,
or
merely
of
not
being
in
time
for
tea
,
with
muffins
and
*NL*
toast
,
at
the
Rue
Royale
tea-rooms
,
where
she
believed
that
regular
*NL*
attendance
was
indispensable
,
and
set
the
seal
upon
a
woman
's
*NL*
certificate
of
`
smartness
,
'
Swann
,
enraptured
,
as
all
of
us
are
,
at
*NL*
times
,
by
the
natural
behaviour
of
a
child
,
or
by
the
likeness
of
a
*NL*
portrait
,
which
appears
to
be
on
the
point
of
speaking
,
would
feel
so
*NL*
distinctly
the
soul
of
his
mistress
rising
to
fill
the
outlines
of
her
*NL*
face
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
going
across
and
welcoming
it
*NL*
with
his
lips
.
``
Oh
,
then
,
so
little
Odette
wants
us
to
take
her
to
the
*NL*
flower-show
,
does
she
?
she
wants
to
be
admired
,
does
she
?
very
well
,
we
*NL*
will
take
her
there
,
we
can
but
obey
her
wishes
.
''
As
Swann
's
sight
was
*NL*
beginning
to
fail
,
he
had
to
resign
himself
to
a
pair
of
spectacles
,
*NL*
which
he
wore
at
home
,
when
working
,
while
to
face
the
world
he
adopted
*NL*
a
single
eyeglass
,
as
being
less
disfiguring
.
The
first
time
that
she
*NL*
saw
it
in
his
eye
,
she
could
not
contain
herself
for
joy
:
``
I
really
do
*NL*
think
--
for
a
man
,
that
is
to
say
--
it
is
tremendously
smart
!
How
nice
you
*NL*
look
with
it
!
Every
inch
a
gentleman
.
All
you
want
now
is
a
title
!
''
she
*NL*
concluded
,
with
a
tinge
of
regret
in
her
voice
.
He
liked
Odette
to
say
*NL*
these
things
,
just
as
,
if
he
had
been
in
love
with
a
Breton
girl
,
he
*NL*
would
have
enjoyed
seeing
her
in
her
coif
and
hearing
her
say
that
she
*NL*
believed
in
ghosts
.
Always
until
then
,
as
is
common
among
men
whose
*NL*
taste
for
the
fine
arts
develops
independently
of
their
sensuality
,
a
*NL*
grotesque
disparity
had
existed
between
the
satisfactions
which
he
would
*NL*
accord
to
either
taste
simultaneously
;
yielding
to
the
seduction
of
*NL*
works
of
art
which
grew
more
and
more
subtle
as
the
women
in
whose
*NL*
company
he
enjoyed
them
grew
more
illiterate
and
common
,
he
would
take
a
*NL*
little
servant-girl
to
a
screened
box
in
a
theatre
where
there
was
some
*NL*
decadent
piece
which
he
had
wished
to
see
performed
,
or
to
an
exhibition
*NL*
of
impressionist
painting
,
with
the
conviction
,
moreover
,
that
an
*NL*
educated
,
`
society
'
woman
would
have
understood
them
no
better
,
but
*NL*
would
not
have
managed
to
keep
quiet
about
them
so
prettily
.
But
,
now
*NL*
that
he
was
in
love
with
Odette
,
all
this
was
changed
;
to
share
her
*NL*
sympathies
,
to
strive
to
be
one
with
her
in
spirit
was
a
task
so
*NL*
attractive
that
he
tried
to
find
satisfaction
in
the
things
that
she
*NL*
liked
,
and
did
find
a
pleasure
,
not
only
in
copying
her
habits
but
in
*NL*
adopting
her
opinions
,
which
was
all
the
deeper
because
,
as
those
habits
*NL*
and
opinions
sprang
from
no
roots
in
her
intelligence
,
they
suggested
*NL*
to
him
nothing
except
that
love
,
for
the
sake
of
which
he
had
preferred
*NL*
them
to
his
own
.
If
he
went
again
to
_
Serge
Panine
_
,
if
he
looked
out
*NL*
for
opportunities
of
going
to
watch
Olivier
Métra
conducting
,
it
was
for
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
being
initiated
into
every
one
of
the
ideas
in
Odette
's
*NL*
mind
,
of
feeling
that
he
had
an
equal
share
in
all
her
tastes
.
This
*NL*
charm
of
drawing
him
closer
to
her
,
which
her
favourite
plays
and
*NL*
pictures
and
places
possessed
,
struck
him
as
being
more
mysterious
than
*NL*
the
intrinsic
charm
of
more
beautiful
things
and
places
,
which
appealed
*NL*
to
him
by
their
beauty
,
but
without
recalling
her
.
Besides
,
having
*NL*
allowed
the
intellectual
beliefs
of
his
youth
to
grow
faint
,
until
his
*NL*
scepticism
,
as
a
finished
`
man
of
the
world
,
'
had
gradually
penetrated
*NL*
them
unawares
,
he
held
-LRB-
or
at
least
he
had
held
for
so
long
that
he
had
*NL*
fallen
into
the
habit
of
saying
-RRB-
that
the
objects
which
we
admire
have
*NL*
no
absolute
value
in
themselves
,
that
the
whole
thing
is
a
matter
of
*NL*
dates
and
castes
,
and
consists
in
a
series
of
fashions
,
the
most
vulgar
*NL*
of
which
are
worth
just
as
much
as
those
which
are
regarded
as
the
most
*NL*
refined
.
And
as
he
had
decided
that
the
importance
which
Odette
attached
*NL*
to
receiving
cards
tot
a
private
view
was
not
in
itself
any
more
*NL*
ridiculous
than
the
pleasure
which
he
himself
had
at
one
time
felt
in
*NL*
going
to
luncheon
with
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
so
he
did
not
think
that
the
*NL*
admiration
which
she
professed
for
Monte-Carlo
or
for
the
Righi
was
any
*NL*
more
unreasonable
than
his
own
liking
for
Holland
-LRB-
which
she
imagined
*NL*
as
ugly
-RRB-
and
for
Versailles
-LRB-
which
bored
her
to
tears
-RRB-
.
And
so
he
denied
*NL*
himself
the
pleasure
of
visiting
those
places
,
consoling
himself
with
*NL*
the
reflection
that
it
was
for
her
sake
that
he
wished
to
feel
,
to
like
*NL*
nothing
that
was
not
equally
felt
and
liked
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
everything
else
that
formed
part
of
Odette
's
environment
,
and
was
*NL*
no
more
,
in
a
sense
,
than
the
means
whereby
he
might
see
and
talk
to
her
*NL*
more
often
,
he
enjoyed
the
society
of
the
Verdurins
.
With
them
,
since
,
*NL*
at
the
heart
of
all
their
entertainments
,
dinners
,
musical
evenings
,
*NL*
games
,
suppers
in
fancy
dress
,
excursions
to
the
country
,
theatre
*NL*
parties
,
even
the
infrequent
`
big
evenings
'
when
they
entertained
*NL*
`
bores
,
'
there
were
the
presence
of
Odette
,
the
sight
of
Odette
,
*NL*
conversation
with
Odette
,
an
inestimable
boon
which
the
Verdurins
,
by
*NL*
inviting
him
to
their
house
,
bestowed
on
Swann
,
he
was
happier
in
the
*NL*
little
`
nucleus
'
than
anywhere
else
,
and
tried
to
find
some
genuine
*NL*
merit
in
each
of
its
members
,
imagining
that
his
tastes
would
lead
him
*NL*
to
frequent
their
society
for
the
rest
of
his
life
.
Never
daring
to
*NL*
whisper
to
himself
,
lest
he
should
doubt
the
truth
of
the
suggestion
,
*NL*
that
he
would
always
be
in
love
with
Odette
,
at
least
when
he
tried
to
*NL*
suppose
that
he
would
always
go
to
the
Verdurins
'
-LRB-
a
proposition
*NL*
which
,
a
priori
,
raised
fewer
fundamental
objections
on
the
part
of
his
*NL*
intelligence
-RRB-
,
he
saw
himself
for
the
future
continuing
to
meet
Odette
*NL*
every
evening
;
that
did
not
,
perhaps
,
come
quite
to
the
same
thing
as
*NL*
his
being
permanently
in
love
with
her
,
but
for
the
moment
while
he
was
*NL*
in
love
with
her
,
to
feel
that
he
would
not
,
one
day
,
cease
to
see
her
*NL*
was
all
that
he
could
ask
.
``
What
a
charming
atmosphere
!
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
.
``
How
entirely
genuine
life
is
to
these
people
!
They
are
far
*NL*
more
intelligent
,
far
more
artistic
,
surely
,
than
the
people
one
knows
.
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
,
in
spite
of
a
few
trifling
exaggerations
which
are
rather
*NL*
absurd
,
has
a
sincere
love
of
painting
and
music
!
What
a
passion
for
*NL*
works
of
art
,
what
anxiety
to
give
pleasure
to
artists
!
Her
ideas
about
*NL*
some
of
the
people
one
knows
are
not
quite
right
,
but
then
their
ideas
*NL*
about
artistic
circles
are
altogether
wrong
!
Possibly
I
make
no
great
*NL*
intellectual
demands
upon
conversation
,
but
I
am
perfectly
happy
talking
*NL*
to
Cottard
,
although
he
does
trot
out
those
idiotic
puns
.
And
as
for
*NL*
the
painter
,
if
he
is
rather
unpleasantly
affected
when
he
tries
to
be
*NL*
paradoxical
,
still
he
has
one
of
the
finest
brains
that
I
have
ever
come
*NL*
across
.
Besides
,
what
is
most
important
,
one
feels
quite
free
there
,
one
*NL*
does
what
one
likes
without
constraint
or
fuss
.
What
a
flow
of
humour
*NL*
there
is
every
day
in
that
drawing-room
!
Certainly
,
with
a
few
rare
*NL*
exceptions
,
I
never
want
to
go
anywhere
else
again
.
It
will
become
more
*NL*
and
more
of
a
habit
,
and
I
shall
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
among
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
the
qualities
which
he
supposed
to
be
an
intrinsic
part
of
*NL*
the
Verdurin
character
were
no
more
,
really
,
than
their
superficial
*NL*
reflection
of
the
pleasure
which
had
been
enjoyed
in
their
society
by
*NL*
his
love
for
Odette
,
those
qualities
became
more
serious
,
more
profound
,
*NL*
more
vital
,
as
that
pleasure
increased
.
Since
Mme.
Verdurin
gave
Swann
,
*NL*
now
and
then
,
what
alone
could
constitute
his
happiness
;
since
,
on
an
*NL*
evening
when
he
felt
anxious
because
Odette
had
talked
rather
more
to
*NL*
one
of
the
party
than
to
another
,
and
,
in
a
spasm
of
irritation
,
would
*NL*
not
take
the
initiative
by
asking
her
whether
she
was
coming
home
,
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
brought
peace
and
joy
to
his
troubled
spirit
by
the
spontaneous
*NL*
exclamation
:
``
Odette
!
You
'll
see
M.
Swann
home
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
;
since
,
*NL*
when
the
summer
holidays
came
,
and
after
he
had
asked
himself
uneasily
*NL*
whether
Odette
might
not
leave
Paris
without
him
,
whether
he
would
still
*NL*
be
able
to
see
her
every
day
,
Mme.
Verdurin
was
going
to
invite
them
*NL*
both
to
spend
the
summer
with
her
in
the
country
;
Swann
,
unconsciously
*NL*
allowing
gratitude
and
self-interest
to
filter
into
his
intelligence
and
*NL*
to
influence
his
ideas
,
went
so
far
as
to
proclaim
that
Mme.
Verdurin
*NL*
was
``
a
great
and
noble
soul
.
''
Should
any
of
his
old
fellow-pupils
in
the
*NL*
Louvre
school
of
painting
speak
to
him
of
some
rare
or
eminent
artist
,
*NL*
``
I
'd
a
hundred
times
rather
,
''
he
would
reply
,
``
have
the
Verdurins
.
''
And
,
*NL*
with
a
solemnity
of
diction
which
was
new
in
him
:
``
They
are
magnanimous
*NL*
creatures
,
and
magnanimity
is
,
after
all
,
the
one
thing
that
matters
,
*NL*
the
one
thing
that
gives
us
distinction
here
on
earth
.
Look
you
,
there
*NL*
are
only
two
classes
of
men
,
the
magnanimous
,
and
the
rest
;
and
I
have
*NL*
reached
an
age
when
one
has
to
take
sides
,
to
decide
once
and
for
all
*NL*
whom
one
is
going
to
like
and
dislike
,
to
stick
to
the
people
one
likes
,
*NL*
and
,
to
make
up
for
the
time
one
has
wasted
with
the
others
,
never
to
*NL*
leave
them
again
as
long
as
one
lives
.
Very
well
!
''
he
went
on
,
with
the
*NL*
slight
emotion
which
a
man
feels
when
,
even
without
being
fully
aware
of
*NL*
what
he
is
doing
,
he
says
something
,
not
because
it
is
true
but
because
*NL*
he
enjoys
saying
it
,
and
listens
to
his
own
voice
uttering
the
words
*NL*
as
though
they
came
from
some
one
else
,
``
The
die
is
now
cast
;
I
have
*NL*
elected
to
love
none
but
magnanimous
souls
,
and
to
live
only
in
an
*NL*
atmosphere
of
magnanimity
.
You
ask
me
whether
Mme.
Verdurin
is
really
*NL*
intelligent
.
I
can
assure
you
that
she
has
given
me
proofs
of
a
nobility
*NL*
of
heart
,
of
a
loftiness
of
soul
,
to
which
no
one
could
possibly
*NL*
attain
--
how
could
they
?
--
without
a
corresponding
loftiness
of
mind
.
*NL*
Without
question
,
she
has
a
profound
understanding
of
art
.
But
it
is
*NL*
not
,
perhaps
,
in
that
that
she
is
most
admirable
;
every
little
action
,
*NL*
ingeniously
,
exquisitely
kind
,
which
she
has
performed
for
my
sake
,
*NL*
every
friendly
attention
,
simple
little
things
,
quite
domestic
and
yet
*NL*
quite
sublime
,
reveal
a
more
profound
comprehension
of
existence
than
*NL*
all
your
textbooks
of
philosophy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
He
might
have
reminded
himself
,
all
the
same
,
that
there
were
various
*NL*
old
friends
of
his
family
who
were
just
as
simple
as
the
Verdurins
,
*NL*
companions
of
his
early
days
who
were
just
as
fond
of
art
,
that
he
knew
*NL*
other
`
great-hearted
creatures
,
'
and
that
,
nevertheless
,
since
he
had
*NL*
cast
his
vote
in
favour
of
simplicity
,
the
arts
,
and
magnanimity
,
he
had
*NL*
entirely
ceased
to
see
them
.
But
these
people
did
not
know
Odette
,
and
,
*NL*
if
they
had
known
her
,
would
never
have
thought
of
introducing
her
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
there
was
probably
not
,
in
the
whole
of
the
Verdurin
circle
,
a
*NL*
single
one
of
the
`
faithful
'
who
loved
them
,
or
believed
that
he
loved
*NL*
them
,
as
dearly
as
did
Swann
.
And
yet
,
when
M.
Verdurin
said
that
he
was
*NL*
not
satisfied
with
Swann
,
he
had
not
only
expressed
his
own
sentiments
,
*NL*
he
had
unwittingly
discovered
his
wife
's
.
Doubtless
Swann
had
too
*NL*
particular
an
affection
for
Odette
,
as
to
which
he
had
failed
to
take
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
daily
into
his
confidence
;
doubtless
the
very
discretion
*NL*
with
which
he
availed
himself
of
the
Verdurins
'
hospitality
,
refraining
,
*NL*
often
,
from
coming
to
dine
with
them
for
a
reason
which
they
never
*NL*
suspected
,
and
in
place
of
which
they
saw
only
an
anxiety
on
his
part
*NL*
not
to
have
to
decline
an
invitation
to
the
house
of
some
`
bore
'
or
*NL*
other
;
doubtless
,
also
,
and
despite
all
the
precautions
which
he
had
*NL*
taken
to
keep
it
from
them
,
the
gradual
discovery
which
they
were
*NL*
making
of
his
brilliant
position
in
society
--
doubtless
all
these
things
*NL*
contributed
to
their
general
annoyance
with
Swann
.
But
the
real
,
the
*NL*
fundamental
reason
was
quite
different
.
What
had
happened
was
that
they
*NL*
had
at
once
discovered
in
him
a
locked
door
,
a
reserved
,
impenetrable
*NL*
chamber
in
which
he
still
professed
silently
to
himself
that
the
*NL*
Princesse
de
Sagan
was
not
grotesque
,
and
that
Cottard
's
jokes
were
*NL*
not
amusing
;
in
a
word
-LRB-
and
for
all
that
he
never
once
abandoned
his
*NL*
friendly
attitude
towards
them
all
,
or
revolted
from
their
dogmas
-RRB-
,
they
*NL*
had
discovered
an
impossibility
of
imposing
those
dogmas
upon
him
,
of
*NL*
entirely
converting
him
to
their
faith
,
the
like
of
which
they
had
never
*NL*
come
across
in
anyone
before
.
They
would
have
forgiven
his
going
to
the
*NL*
houses
of
`
bores
'
-LRB-
to
whom
,
as
it
happened
,
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
*NL*
infinitely
preferred
the
Verdurins
and
all
their
little
`
nucleus
'
-RRB-
had
*NL*
he
consented
to
set
a
good
example
by
openly
renouncing
those
`
bores
'
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
the
`
faithful
.
'
But
that
was
an
abjuration
which
,
as
*NL*
they
well
knew
,
they
were
powerless
to
extort
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
difference
was
there
in
a
`
newcomer
'
whom
Odette
had
asked
them
*NL*
to
invite
,
although
she
herself
had
met
him
only
a
few
times
,
and
on
*NL*
whom
they
were
building
great
hopes
--
the
Comte
de
Forcheville
!
-LRB-
It
*NL*
turned
out
that
he
was
nothing
more
nor
less
than
the
brother-in-law
of
*NL*
Saniette
,
a
discovery
which
filled
all
the
`
faithful
'
with
amazement
:
*NL*
the
manners
of
the
old
palaeographer
were
so
humble
that
they
had
always
*NL*
supposed
him
to
be
of
a
class
inferior
,
socially
,
to
their
own
,
and
*NL*
had
never
expected
to
learn
that
he
came
of
a
rich
and
relatively
*NL*
aristocratic
family
.
-RRB-
Of
course
,
Forcheville
was
enormously
the
`
swell
,
'
*NL*
which
Swann
was
not
or
had
quite
ceased
to
be
;
of
course
,
he
would
never
*NL*
dream
of
placing
,
as
Swann
now
placed
,
the
Verdurin
circle
above
any
*NL*
other
.
But
he
lacked
that
natural
refinement
which
prevented
Swann
from
*NL*
associating
himself
with
the
criticisms
-LRB-
too
obviously
false
to
be
worth
*NL*
his
notice
-RRB-
that
Mme.
Verdurin
levelled
at
people
whom
he
knew
.
As
for
*NL*
the
vulgar
and
affected
tirades
in
which
the
painter
sometimes
indulged
,
*NL*
the
bag-man
's
pleasantries
which
Cottard
used
to
hazard
,
--
whereas
*NL*
Swann
,
who
liked
both
men
sincerely
,
could
easily
find
excuses
for
these
*NL*
without
having
either
the
courage
or
the
hypocrisy
to
applaud
them
,
*NL*
Forcheville
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
on
an
intellectual
level
which
*NL*
permitted
him
to
be
stupified
,
amazed
by
the
invective
-LRB-
without
in
the
*NL*
least
understanding
what
it
all
was
about
-RRB-
,
and
to
be
frankly
delighted
*NL*
by
the
wit
.
And
the
very
first
dinner
at
the
Verdurins
'
at
which
*NL*
Forcheville
was
present
threw
a
glaring
light
upon
all
the
differences
*NL*
between
them
,
made
his
qualities
start
into
prominence
and
precipitated
*NL*
the
disgrace
of
Swann
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
at
this
dinner
,
besides
the
usual
party
,
a
professor
from
*NL*
the
Sorbonne
,
one
Brichot
,
who
had
met
M.
and
Mme.
Verdurin
at
a
*NL*
watering-place
somewhere
,
and
,
if
his
duties
at
the
university
and
his
*NL*
other
works
of
scholarship
had
not
left
him
with
very
little
time
*NL*
to
spare
,
would
gladly
have
come
to
them
more
often
.
For
he
had
that
*NL*
curiosity
,
that
superstitious
outlook
on
life
,
which
,
combined
with
a
*NL*
certain
amount
of
scepticism
with
regard
to
the
object
of
their
studies

earn
for
men
of
intelligence
,
whatever
their
profession
,
for
doctors
*NL*
who
do
not
believe
in
medicine
,
for
schoolmasters
who
do
not
believe
in
*NL*
Latin
exercises
,
the
reputation
of
having
broad
,
brilliant
,
and
indeed
*NL*
superior
minds
.
He
affected
,
when
at
Mme.
Verdurin
's
,
to
choose
his
*NL*
illustrations
from
among
the
most
topical
subjects
of
the
day
,
when
he
*NL*
spoke
of
philosophy
or
history
,
principally
because
he
regarded
those
*NL*
sciences
as
no
more
,
really
,
than
a
preparation
for
life
itself
,
and
*NL*
imagined
that
he
was
seeing
put
into
practice
by
the
`
little
clan
'
*NL*
what
hitherto
he
had
known
only
from
books
;
and
also
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
because
,
having
had
drilled
into
him
as
a
boy
,
and
having
unconsciously
*NL*
preserved
,
a
feeling
of
reverence
for
certain
subjects
,
he
thought
that
*NL*
he
was
casting
aside
the
scholar
's
gown
when
he
ventured
to
treat
those
*NL*
subjects
with
a
conversational
licence
,
which
seemed
so
to
him
only
*NL*
because
the
folds
of
the
gown
still
clung
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
course
of
the
dinner
,
when
M.
de
Forcheville
,
seated
on
the
*NL*
right
of
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
,
in
the
`
newcomer
's
'
honour
,
had
taken
great
*NL*
pains
with
her
toilet
,
observed
to
her
:
``
Quite
original
,
that
white
*NL*
dress
,
''
the
Doctor
,
who
had
never
taken
his
eyes
off
him
,
so
curious
was
*NL*
he
to
learn
the
nature
and
attributes
of
what
he
called
a
``
de
,
''
and
was
*NL*
on
the
look-out
for
an
opportunity
of
attracting
his
attention
,
so
as
*NL*
to
come
into
closer
contact
with
him
,
caught
in
its
flight
the
adjective
*NL*
'
_
blanche
_
'
and
,
his
eyes
still
glued
to
his
plate
,
snapped
out
,
*NL*
''
_
Blanche
_
?
Blanche
of
Castile
?
''
then
,
without
moving
his
head
,
shot
*NL*
a
furtive
glance
to
right
and
left
of
him
,
doubtful
,
but
happy
on
the
*NL*
whole
.
While
Swann
,
by
the
painful
and
futile
effort
which
he
made
to
*NL*
smile
,
testified
that
he
thought
the
pun
absurd
,
Forcheville
had
shewn
*NL*
at
once
that
he
could
appreciate
its
subtlety
,
and
that
he
was
a
man
of
*NL*
the
world
,
by
keeping
within
its
proper
limits
a
mirth
the
spontaneity
*NL*
of
which
had
charmed
Mme.
Verdurin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
to
say
of
a
scientist
like
that
?
''
she
asked
Forcheville
.
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
talk
seriously
to
him
for
two
minutes
on
end
.
Is
that
the
*NL*
sort
of
thing
you
tell
them
at
your
hospital
?
''
she
went
on
,
turning
to
*NL*
the
Doctor
.
``
They
must
have
some
pretty
lively
times
there
,
if
that
's
*NL*
the
case
.
I
can
see
that
I
shall
have
to
get
taken
in
as
a
patient
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
heard
the
Doctor
speak
of
that
wicked
old
humbug
,
Blanche
of
*NL*
Castile
,
if
I
may
so
express
myself
.
Am
I
not
right
,
Madame
?
''
Brichot
*NL*
appealed
to
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
,
swooning
with
merriment
,
her
eyes
*NL*
tightly
closed
,
had
buried
her
face
in
her
two
hands
,
from
between
*NL*
which
,
now
and
then
,
escaped
a
muffled
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
,
Madame
,
I
would
not
dream
of
shocking
the
*NL*
reverent-minded
,
if
there
are
any
such
around
this
table
,
_
sub
rosa
_
...
*NL*
I
recognise
,
moreover
,
that
our
ineffable
and
Athenian
--
oh
,
how
*NL*
infinitely
Athenian
--
Republic
is
capable
of
honouring
,
in
the
person
of
*NL*
that
obscurantist
old
she-Capet
,
the
first
of
our
chiefs
of
police
.
Yes
,
*NL*
indeed
,
my
dear
host
,
yes
,
indeed
!
''
he
repeated
in
his
ringing
voice
,
*NL*
which
sounded
a
separate
note
for
each
syllable
,
in
reply
to
a
protest
*NL*
by
M.
Verdurin
.
``
The
Chronicle
of
Saint
Denis
,
and
the
authenticity
of
*NL*
its
information
is
beyond
question
,
leaves
us
no
room
for
doubt
on
that
*NL*
point
.
No
one
could
be
more
fitly
chosen
as
Patron
by
a
secularising
*NL*
proletariat
than
that
mother
of
a
Saint
,
who
let
him
see
some
pretty
*NL*
fishy
saints
besides
,
as
Suger
says
,
and
other
great
St.
Bernards
of
the
*NL*
sort
;
for
with
her
it
was
a
case
of
taking
just
what
you
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
gentleman
?
''
Forcheville
asked
Mme.
Verdurin
.
``
He
seems
to
*NL*
speak
with
great
authority
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
do
n't
know
the
famous
Brichot
?
Why
,
he
's
*NL*
celebrated
all
over
Europe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
Bréchot
,
is
it
?
''
exclaimed
Forcheville
,
who
had
not
quite
*NL*
caught
the
name
.
``
You
must
tell
me
all
about
him
''
;
he
went
on
,
fastening
*NL*
a
pair
of
goggle
eyes
on
the
celebrity
.
``
It
's
always
interesting
to
*NL*
meet
well-known
people
at
dinner
.
But
,
I
say
,
you
ask
us
to
very
select
*NL*
parties
here
.
No
dull
evenings
in
this
house
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
know
what
it
is
really
,
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
modestly
.
*NL*
``
They
feel
safe
here
.
They
can
talk
about
whatever
they
like
,
and
the
*NL*
conversation
goes
off
like
fireworks
.
Now
Brichot
,
this
evening
,
is
*NL*
nothing
.
I
've
seen
him
,
do
n't
you
know
,
when
he
's
been
with
me
,
simply
*NL*
dazzling
;
you
'd
want
to
go
on
your
knees
to
him
.
Well
,
with
anyone
else
*NL*
he
's
not
the
same
man
,
he
's
not
in
the
least
witty
,
you
have
to
drag
the
*NL*
words
out
of
him
,
he
's
even
boring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
strange
,
''
remarked
Forcheville
with
fitting
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sort
of
wit
like
Brichot
's
would
have
been
regarded
as
out-and-out
*NL*
stupidity
by
the
people
among
whom
Swann
had
spent
his
early
life
,
*NL*
for
all
that
it
is
quite
compatible
with
real
intelligence
.
And
the
*NL*
intelligence
of
the
Professor
's
vigorous
and
well-nourished
brain
might
*NL*
easily
have
been
envied
by
many
of
the
people
in
society
who
seemed
*NL*
witty
enough
to
Swann
.
But
these
last
had
so
thoroughly
inculcated
into
*NL*
him
their
likes
and
dislikes
,
at
least
in
everything
that
pertained
*NL*
to
their
ordinary
social
existence
,
including
that
annex
to
social
*NL*
existence
which
belongs
,
strictly
speaking
,
to
the
domain
of
*NL*
intelligence
,
namely
,
conversation
,
that
Swann
could
not
see
anything
*NL*
in
Brichot
's
pleasantries
;
to
him
they
were
merely
pedantic
,
vulgar
,
*NL*
and
disgustingly
coarse
.
He
was
shocked
,
too
,
being
accustomed
to
*NL*
good
manners
,
by
the
rude
,
almost
barrack-room
tone
which
this
*NL*
student-in-arms
adopted
,
no
matter
to
whom
he
was
speaking
.
Finally
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
he
had
lost
all
patience
that
evening
as
he
watched
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
welcoming
,
with
such
unnecessary
warmth
,
this
Forcheville
*NL*
fellow
,
whom
it
had
been
Odette
's
unaccountable
idea
to
bring
to
the
*NL*
house
.
Feeling
a
little
awkward
,
with
Swann
there
also
,
she
had
asked
*NL*
him
on
her
arrival
:
``
What
do
you
think
of
my
guest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
,
suddenly
realising
for
the
first
time
that
Forcheville
,
whom
*NL*
he
had
known
for
years
,
could
actually
attract
a
woman
,
and
was
quite
a
*NL*
good
specimen
of
a
man
,
had
retorted
:
``
Beastly
!
''
He
had
,
certainly
,
*NL*
no
idea
of
being
jealous
of
Odette
,
but
did
not
feel
quite
so
happy
as
*NL*
usual
,
and
when
Brichot
,
having
begun
to
tell
them
the
story
of
Blanche
*NL*
of
Castile
's
mother
,
who
,
according
to
him
,
``
had
been
with
Henry
*NL*
Plantagenet
for
years
before
they
were
married
,
''
tried
to
prompt
Swann
*NL*
to
beg
him
to
continue
the
story
,
by
interjecting
``
Is
n't
that
so
,
M.
*NL*
Swann
?
''
in
the
martial
accents
which
one
uses
in
order
to
get
down
to
*NL*
the
level
of
an
unintelligent
rustic
or
to
put
the
`
fear
of
God
'
into
*NL*
a
trooper
,
Swann
cut
his
story
short
,
to
the
intense
fury
of
their
*NL*
hostess
,
by
begging
to
be
excused
for
taking
so
little
interest
in
*NL*
Blanche
of
Castile
,
as
he
had
something
that
he
wished
to
ask
the
*NL*
painter
.
He
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
that
afternoon
to
an
exhibition
of
*NL*
the
work
of
another
artist
,
also
a
friend
of
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
had
*NL*
recently
died
,
and
Swann
wished
to
find
out
from
him
-LRB-
for
he
valued
*NL*
his
discrimination
-RRB-
whether
there
had
really
been
anything
more
in
this
*NL*
later
work
than
the
virtuosity
which
had
struck
people
so
forcibly
in
*NL*
his
earlier
exhibitions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
that
point
of
view
it
was
extraordinary
,
but
it
did
not
seem
to
me
*NL*
to
be
a
form
of
art
which
you
could
call
`
elevated
,
'
''
said
Swann
with
a
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elevated
...
to
the
height
of
an
Institute
!
''
interrupted
Cottard
,
*NL*
raising
his
arms
with
mock
solemnity
.
The
whole
table
burst
out
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
I
tell
you
?
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
to
Forcheville
.
``
It
's
simply
*NL*
impossible
to
be
serious
with
him
.
When
you
least
expect
it
,
out
he
*NL*
comes
with
a
joke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
observed
that
Swann
,
and
Swann
alone
,
had
not
unbent
.
For
one
*NL*
thing
he
was
none
too
well
pleased
with
Cottard
for
having
secured
a
*NL*
laugh
at
his
expense
in
front
of
Forcheville
.
But
the
painter
,
instead
*NL*
of
replying
in
a
way
that
might
have
interested
Swann
,
as
he
would
*NL*
probably
have
done
had
they
been
alone
together
,
preferred
to
win
the
*NL*
easy
admiration
of
the
rest
by
exercising
his
wit
upon
the
talent
of
*NL*
their
dead
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
up
to
one
of
them
,
''
he
began
,
``
just
to
see
how
it
was
done
;
I
*NL*
stuck
my
nose
into
it
.
Yes
,
I
do
n't
think
!
Impossible
to
say
whether
*NL*
it
was
done
with
glue
,
with
soap
,
with
sealing-wax
,
with
sunshine
,
with
*NL*
leaven
,
with
excrem
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
one
make
twelve
!
''
shouted
the
Doctor
,
wittily
,
but
just
too
late
,
*NL*
for
no
one
saw
the
point
of
his
interruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
as
though
it
were
done
with
nothing
at
all
,
''
resumed
the
*NL*
painter
.
``
No
more
chance
of
discovering
the
trick
than
there
is
in
the
*NL*
`
Night
Watch
,
'
or
the
`
Regents
,
'
and
it
's
even
bigger
work
than
either
*NL*
Rembrandt
or
Hals
ever
did
.
It
's
all
there
,
--
and
yet
,
no
,
I
'll
take
my
*NL*
oath
it
is
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
just
as
singers
who
have
reached
the
highest
note
in
their
*NL*
compass
,
proceed
to
hum
the
rest
of
the
air
in
falsetto
,
he
had
to
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
murmuring
,
smiling
the
while
,
as
if
,
after
all
,
there
had
*NL*
been
something
irresistibly
amusing
in
the
sheer
beauty
of
the
painting
:
*NL*
``
It
smells
all
right
;
it
makes
your
head
go
round
;
it
catches
your
*NL*
breath
;
you
feel
ticklish
all
over
--
and
not
the
faintest
clue
to
how
*NL*
it
's
done
.
The
man
's
a
sorcerer
;
the
thing
's
a
conjuring-trick
,
it
's
*NL*
a
miracle
,
''
bursting
outright
into
laughter
,
``
it
's
dishonest
!
''
Then
*NL*
stopping
,
solemnly
raising
his
head
,
pitching
his
voice
on
a
double-bass
*NL*
note
which
he
struggled
to
bring
into
harmony
,
he
concluded
,
``
And
it
's
*NL*
so
loyal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Except
at
the
moment
when
he
had
called
it
``
bigger
than
the
`
Night
*NL*
Watch
,
'
''
a
blasphemy
which
had
called
forth
an
instant
protest
from
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
,
who
regarded
the
`
Night
Watch
'
as
the
supreme
masterpiece
of
*NL*
the
universe
-LRB-
conjointly
with
the
`
Ninth
'
and
the
`
Samothrace
'
-RRB-
,
and
at
*NL*
the
word
``
excrement
,
''
which
had
made
Forcheville
throw
a
sweeping
glance
*NL*
round
the
table
to
see
whether
it
was
`
all
right
,
'
before
he
allowed
his
*NL*
lips
to
curve
in
a
prudish
and
conciliatory
smile
,
all
the
party
*NL*
-LRB-
save
Swann
-RRB-
had
kept
their
fascinated
and
adoring
eyes
fixed
upon
the
*NL*
painter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
so
love
him
when
he
goes
up
in
the
air
like
that
!
''
cried
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
,
the
moment
that
he
had
finished
,
enraptured
that
the
*NL*
table-talk
should
have
proved
so
entertaining
on
the
very
night
that
*NL*
Forcheville
was
dining
with
them
for
the
first
time
.
``
Hallo
,
you
!
''
she
*NL*
turned
to
her
husband
,
``
what
's
the
matter
with
you
,
sitting
there
gaping
*NL*
like
a
great
animal
?
You
know
,
though
,
do
n't
you

''
she
apologised
*NL*
for
him
to
the
painter
,
``
that
he
can
talk
quite
well
when
he
chooses

ever
listened
to
you

*NL*
If

only
seen
him
while
you
were
speaking

he
was
just
drinking
*NL*
it
all
in
.
And
to-morrow
he
will
tell
us
everything
you
said
,
without
*NL*
missing
a
word

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

really
,
I
'm
not
joking
!
''
protested
the
painter
,
enchanted
by
the
*NL*
success
of
his
speech
.
``
You
all
look
as
if
you
thought
I
was
pulling
*NL*
your
legs
,
that
it
was
just
a
trick
.
I
'll
take
you
to
see
the
show
,
and
*NL*
then
you
can
say
whether
I
've
been
exaggerating
;
I
'll
bet
you
anything
*NL*
you
like
,
you
'll
come
away
more
`
up
in
the
air
'
than
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
do
n't
suppose
for
a
moment
that
you
're
exaggerating
;
we
only
*NL*
want
you
to
go
on
with
your
dinner
,
and
my
husband
too

Give
M.
Biche
*NL*
some
more
sole
,
ca
n't
you
see
his
has
got
cold
?
We
're
not
in
any
hurry

*NL*
you
're
dashing
round
as

house
was
on
fire

Wait
a
little
;
do
n't
*NL*
serve
the
salad
just
yet

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Cottard
,
who
was
a
shy
woman
and
spoke
but
seldom
,
was
not
lacking
,
*NL*
for
all
that
,
in
self-assurance
when
a
happy
inspiration
put
the
right
*NL*
word
in
her
mouth
.
She
felt
that
it
would
be
well
received
;
the
thought
*NL*
gave
her
confidence
,
and
what
she
was
doing
was
done
with
the
object
not
*NL*
so
much
of
shining
herself
,
as
of
helping
her
husband
on
in
his
career
.
*NL*
And
so
she
did
not
allow
the
word
`
salad
,
'
which
Mme.
Verdurin
had
just
*NL*
uttered
,
to
pass
unchallenged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
a
Japanese
salad
,
is
it
?
''
she
whispered
,
turning
towards
*NL*
Odette
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
in
her
joy
and
confusion
at
the
combination
of
neatness
*NL*
and
daring
which
there
had
been
in
making
so
discreet
and
yet
so
*NL*
unmistakable
an
allusion
to
the
new
and
brilliantly
successful
play
by
*NL*
Dumas
,
she
broke
down
in
a
charming
,
girlish
laugh
,
not
very
loud
,
but
*NL*
so
irresistible
that
it
was
some
time
before
she
could
control
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
lady
?
She
seems
devilish
clever
,
''
said
Forcheville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
not
.
But
we
will
have
one
for
you
if
you
will
all
come
to
*NL*
dinner
on
Friday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
think
me
dreadfully
provincial
,
sir
,
''
said
Mme.
Cottard
to
*NL*
Swann
,
``
but
,
do
you
know
,
I
have
n't
been
yet
to
this
famous
_
Francillon
_
*NL*
that
everybody
's
talking
about
.
The
Doctor
has
been
-LRB-
I
remember
now
,
*NL*
he
told
me
what
a
very
great
pleasure
it
had
been
to
him
to
spend
the
*NL*
evening
with
you
there
-RRB-
and
I
must
confess
,
I
do
n't
see
much
sense
in
*NL*
spending
money
on
seats
for
him
to
take
me
,
when
he
's
seen
the
play
*NL*
already
.
Of
course
an
evening
at
the
Théâtre-Français
is
never
wasted
,
*NL*
really
;
the
acting
's
so
good
there
always
;
but
we
have
some
very
nice
*NL*
friends
,
''
-LRB-
Mme.
Cottard
would
hardly
ever
utter
a
proper
name
,
but
*NL*
restricted
herself
to
``
some
friends
of
ours
''
or
``
one
of
my
friends
,
''
as
*NL*
being
more
`
distinguished
,
'
speaking
in
an
affected
tone
and
with
all
*NL*
the
importance
of
a
person
who
need
give
names
only
when
she
chooses
-RRB-
*NL*
``
who
often
have
a
box
,
and
are
kind
enough
to
take
us
to
all
the
*NL*
new
pieces
that
are
worth
going
to
,
and
so
I
'm
certain
to
see
this
*NL*
_
Francillon
_
sooner
or
later
,
and
then
I
shall
know
what
to
think
.
But
I
*NL*
do
feel
such
a
fool
about
it
,
I
must
confess
,
for
,
whenever
I
pay
a
*NL*
call
anywhere
,
I
find
everybody
talking
--
it
's
only
natural
--
about
that
*NL*
wretched
Japanese
salad
.
Really
and
truly
,
one
's
beginning
to
get
just
a
*NL*
little
tired
of
hearing
about
it
,
''
she
went
on
,
seeing
that
Swann
seemed
*NL*
less
interested
than
she
had
hoped
in
so
burning
a
topic
.
``
I
must
admit
,
*NL*
though
,
that
it
's
sometimes
quite
amusing
,
the
way
they
joke
about
it
:
*NL*
I
've
got
a
friend
,
now
,
who
is
most
original
,
though
she
's
really
a
*NL*
beautiful
woman
,
most
popular
in
society
,
goes
everywhere
,
and
she
tells
*NL*
me
that
she
got
her
cook
to
make
one
of
these
Japanese
salads
,
putting
*NL*
in
everything
that
young
M.
Dumas
says
you
're
to
put
in
,
in
the
play
.
*NL*
Then
she
asked
just
a
few
friends
to
come
and
taste
it
.
I
was
not
among
*NL*
the
favoured
few
,
I
'm
sorry
to
say
.
But
she
told
us
all
about
it
on
her
*NL*
next
`
day
'
;
it
seems
it
was
quite
horrible
,
she
made
us
all
laugh
*NL*
till
we
cried
.
I
do
n't
know
;
perhaps
it
was
the
way
she
told
it
,
''
Mme.
*NL*
Cottard
added
doubtfully
,
seeing
that
Swann
still
looked
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
imagining
that
it
was
,
perhaps
,
because
he
had
not
been
amused
by
*NL*
_
Francillon
_
:
``
Well
,
I
daresay
I
shall
be
disappointed
with
it
,
after
*NL*
all
.
I
do
n't
suppose
it
's
as
good
as
the
piece
Mme.
de
Crécy
worships
,
*NL*
_
Serge
Panine
_
.
There
's
a
play
,
if
you
like
;
so
deep
,
makes
you
*NL*
think
!
But
just
fancy
giving
a
receipt
for
a
salad
on
the
stage
of
the
*NL*
Théâtre-Français
!
Now
,
_
Serge
Panine
_
--
!
But
then
,
it
's
like
everything
*NL*
that
comes
from
the
pen
of
M.
Georges
Ohnet
,
it
's
so
well
written
.
I
*NL*
wonder
if
you
know
the
_
Maître
des
Forges
_
,
which
I
like
even
better
*NL*
than
_
Serge
Panine
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
''
said
Swann
with
polite
irony
,
``
but
I
can
assure
you
that
*NL*
my
want
of
admiration
is
almost
equally
divided
between
those
*NL*
masterpieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
now
;
that
's
very
interesting
.
And
what
do
n't
you
like
about
*NL*
them
?
Wo
n't
you
ever
change
your
mind
?
Perhaps
you
think
he
's
a
little
*NL*
too
sad
.
Well
,
well
,
what
I
always
say
is
,
one
should
never
argue
about
*NL*
plays
or
novels
.
Everyone
has
his
own
way
of
looking
at
things
,
and
what
*NL*
may
be
horrible
to
you
is
,
perhaps
,
just
what
I
like
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
interrupted
by
Forcheville
's
addressing
Swann
.
What
had
happened
*NL*
was
that
,
while
Mme.
Cottard
was
discussing
_
Francillon
_
,
Forcheville
*NL*
had
been
expressing
to
Mme.
Verdurin
his
admiration
for
what
he
called
*NL*
the
``
little
speech
''
of
the
painter
.
``
Your
friend
has
such
a
flow
of
*NL*
language
,
such
a
memory
!
''
he
had
said
to
her
when
the
painter
had
*NL*
come
to
a
standstill
,
``
I
've
seldom
seen
anything
like
it
.
He
'd
make
a
*NL*
first-rate
preacher
.
By
Jove
,
I
wish
I
was
like
that
.
What
with
him
and
*NL*
M.
Bréchot
you
've
drawn
two
lucky
numbers
to-night
;
though
I
'm
not
so
*NL*
sure
that
,
simply
as
a
speaker
,
this
one
does
n't
knock
spots
off
the
*NL*
Professor
.
It
comes
more
naturally
with
him
,
less
like
reading
from
a
*NL*
book
.
Of
course
,
the
way
he
goes
on
,
he
does
use
some
words
that
are
*NL*
a
bit
realistic
,
and
all
that
;
but
that
's
quite
the
thing
nowadays
;
*NL*
anyhow
,
it
's
not
often
I
've
seen
a
man
hold
the
floor
as
cleverly
as
*NL*
that
,
`
hold
the
spittoon
,
'
as
we
used
to
say
in
the
regiment
,
where
,
by
*NL*
the
way
,
we
had
a
man
he
rather
reminds
me
of
.
You
could
take
anything
*NL*
you
liked
--
I
do
n't
know
what
--
this
glass
,
say
;
and
he
'd
talk
away
about
*NL*
it
for
hours
;
no
,
not
this
glass
;
that
's
a
silly
thing
to
say
,
I
'm
*NL*
sorry
;
but
something
a
little
bigger
,
like
the
battle
of
Waterloo
,
or
*NL*
anything
of
that
sort
,
he
'd
tell
you
things
you
simply
would
n't
believe
.
*NL*
Why
,
Swann
was
in
the
regiment
then
;
he
must
have
known
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
much
of
M.
Swann
?
''
asked
Mme.
Verdurin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no
!
''
he
answered
,
and
then
,
thinking
that
if
he
made
himself
*NL*
pleasant
to
Swann
he
might
find
favour
with
Odette
,
he
decided
to
*NL*
take
this
opportunity
of
flattering
him
by
speaking
of
his
fashionable
*NL*
friends
,
but
speaking
as
a
man
of
the
world
himself
,
in
a
tone
of
*NL*
good-natured
criticism
,
and
not
as
though
he
were
congratulating
Swann
*NL*
upon
some
undeserved
good
fortune
:
``
Is
n't
that
so
,
Swann
?
I
never
see
*NL*
anything
of
you
,
do
I
?
--
But
then
,
where
on
earth
is
one
to
see
him
?
The
*NL*
creature
spends
all
his
time
shut
up
with
the
La
Trémoïlles
,
with
the
*NL*
Laumes
and
all
that
lot
!
''
The
imputation
would
have
been
false
at
any
*NL*
time
,
and
was
all
the
more
so
,
now
that
for
at
least
a
year
Swann
had
*NL*
given
up
going
to
almost
any
house
but
the
Verdurins
'
.
But
the
mere
*NL*
names
of
families
whom
the
Verdurins
did
not
know
were
received
by
them
*NL*
in
a
reproachful
silence
.
M.
Verdurin
,
dreading
the
painful
impression
*NL*
which
the
mention
of
these
`
bores
,
'
especially
when
flung
at
her
in
this
*NL*
tactless
fashion
,
and
in
front
of
all
the
`
faithful
,
'
was
bound
to
*NL*
make
on
his
wife
,
cast
a
covert
glance
at
her
,
instinct
with
anxious
*NL*
solicitude
.
He
saw
then
that
in
her
fixed
resolution
to
take
no
notice
,
*NL*
to
have
escaped
contact
,
altogether
,
with
the
news
which
had
just
been
*NL*
addressed
to
her
,
not
merely
to
remain
dumb
but
to
have
been
deaf
*NL*
as
well
,
as
we
pretend
to
be
when
a
friend
who
has
been
in
the
wrong
*NL*
attempts
to
slip
into
his
conversation
some
excuse
which
we
should
*NL*
appear
to
be
accepting
,
should
we
appear
to
have
heard
it
without
*NL*
protesting
,
or
when
some
one
utters
the
name
of
an
enemy
,
the
very
*NL*
mention
of
whom
in
our
presence
is
forbidden
;
Mme.
Verdurin
,
so
that
*NL*
her
silence
should
have
the
appearance
,
not
of
consent
but
of
the
*NL*
unconscious
silence
which
inanimate
objects
preserve
,
had
suddenly
*NL*
emptied
her
face
of
all
life
,
of
all
mobility
;
her
rounded
forehead
was
*NL*
nothing
,
now
,
but
an
exquisite
study
in
high
relief
,
which
the
name
of
*NL*
those
La
Trémoïlles
,
with
whom
Swann
was
always
`
shut
up
,
'
had
failed
*NL*
to
penetrate
;
her
nose
,
just
perceptibly
wrinkled
in
a
frown
,
exposed
to
*NL*
view
two
dark
cavities
that
were
,
surely
,
modelled
from
life
.
You
would
*NL*
have
said
that
her
half-opened
lips
were
just
about
to
speak
.
It
was
*NL*
all
no
more
,
however
,
than
a
wax
cast
,
a
mask
in
plaster
,
the
sculptor
's
*NL*
design
for
a
monument
,
a
bust
to
be
exhibited
in
the
Palace
of
Industry
,
*NL*
where
the
public
would
most
certainly
gather
in
front
of
it
and
marvel
*NL*
to
see
how
the
sculptor
,
in
expressing
the
unchallengeable
dignity
of
*NL*
the
Verdurins
,
as
opposed
to
that
of
the
La
Trémoïlles
or
Laumes
,
whose
*NL*
equals
-LRB-
if
not
,
indeed
,
their
betters
-RRB-
they
were
,
and
the
equals
and
*NL*
betters
of
all
other
`
bores
'
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
,
had
managed
to
*NL*
invest
with
a
majesty
that
was
almost
Papal
the
whiteness
and
rigidity
*NL*
of
his
stone
.
But
the
marble
at
last
grew
animated
and
let
it
be
*NL*
understood
that
it
did
n't
do
to
be
at
all
squeamish
if
one
went
to
that
*NL*
house
,
since
the
woman
was
always
tipsy
and
the
husband
so
uneducated
*NL*
that
he
called
a
corridor
a
`
collidor
'
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
need
to
pay
me
a
lot
of
money
before
I
'd
let
any
of
that
lot
set
*NL*
foot
inside
my
house
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
concluded
,
gazing
imperially
down
*NL*
on
Swann
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
scarcely
have
expected
him
to
capitulate
so
completely
as
to
*NL*
echo
the
holy
simplicity
of
the
pianist
's
aunt
,
who
at
once
exclaimed
:
*NL*
``
To
think
of
that
,
now
!
What
surprises
me
is
that
they
can
get
anybody
*NL*
to
go
near
them
;
I
'm
sure
I
should
be
afraid
;
one
ca
n't
be
too
careful
.
*NL*
How
can
people
be
so
common
as
to
go
running
after
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
might
,
at
least
,
have
replied
,
like
Forcheville
:
``
Gad
,
she
's
a
*NL*
duchess
;
there
are
still
plenty
of
people
who
are
impressed
by
that
sort
*NL*
of
thing
,
''
which
would
at
least
have
permitted
Mme.
Verdurin
the
final
*NL*
retort
,
``
And
a
lot
of
good
may
it
do
them
!
''
Instead
of
which
,
Swann
*NL*
merely
smiled
,
in
a
manner
which
shewed
,
quite
clearly
,
that
he
could
*NL*
not
,
of
course
,
take
such
an
absurd
suggestion
seriously
.
M.
Verdurin
,
*NL*
who
was
still
casting
furtive
and
intermittent
glances
at
his
wife
,
*NL*
could
see
with
regret
,
and
could
understand
only
too
well
that
she
was
*NL*
now
inflamed
with
the
passion
of
a
Grand
Inquisitor
who
can
not
succeed
*NL*
in
stamping
out
a
heresy
;
and
so
,
in
the
hope
of
bringing
Swann
round
*NL*
to
a
retractation
-LRB-
for
the
courage
of
one
's
opinions
is
always
a
form
of
*NL*
calculating
cowardice
in
the
eyes
of
the
`
other
side
'
-RRB-
,
he
broke
in
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
us
frankly
,
now
,
what
you
think
of
them
yourself
.
We
sha
n't
repeat
*NL*
it
to
them
,
you
may
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
Swann
answered
:
``
Why
,
I
'm
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
the
*NL*
Duchess
-LRB-
if
it
is
of
the
La
Trémoïlles
that
you
're
speaking
-RRB-
.
I
can
*NL*
assure
you
that
everyone
likes
going
to
see
her
.
I
do
n't
go
so
far
as
*NL*
to
say
that
she
's
at
all
`
deep
'
--
''
he
pronounced
the
word
as
if
it
meant
*NL*
something
ridiculous
,
for
his
speech
kept
the
traces
of
certain
mental
*NL*
habits
which
the
recent
change
in
his
life
,
a
rejuvenation
illustrated
*NL*
by
his
passion
for
music
,
had
inclined
him
temporarily
to
discard
,
*NL*
so
that
at
times
he
would
actually
state
his
views
with
considerable
*NL*
warmth
--
``
but
I
am
quite
sincere
when
I
say
that
she
is
intelligent
,
*NL*
while
her
husband
is
positively
a
bookworm
.
They
are
charming
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
explanation
was
terribly
effective
;
Mme.
Verdurin
now
realised
that
*NL*
this
one
state
of
unbelief
would
prevent
her
`
little
nucleus
'
from
ever
*NL*
attaining
to
complete
unanimity
,
and
was
unable
to
restrain
herself
,
in
*NL*
her
fury
at
the
obstinacy
of
this
wretch
who
could
not
see
what
anguish
*NL*
his
words
were
causing
her
,
but
cried
aloud
,
from
the
depths
of
her
*NL*
tortured
heart
,
``
You
may
think
so
if
you
wish
,
but
at
least
you
need
not
*NL*
say
so
to
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
all
depends
upon
what
you
call
intelligence
.
''
Forcheville
felt
that
*NL*
it
was
his
turn
to
be
brilliant
.
``
Come
now
,
Swann
,
tell
us
what
you
mean
*NL*
by
intelligence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
cried
Odette
,
``
that
's
one
of
the
big
things
I
beg
him
to
tell
*NL*
me
about
,
and
he
never
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
...
''
protested
Swann
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
nonsense
!
''
said
Odette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
water-butt
?
''
asked
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
you
,
''
pursued
Forcheville
,
``
does
intelligence
mean
what
they
call
*NL*
clever
talk
;
you
know
,
the
sort
of
people
who
worm
their
way
into
*NL*
society
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finish
your
sweet
,
so
that
they
can
take
your
plate
away
!
''
said
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
sourly
to
Saniette
,
who
was
lost
in
thought
and
had
stopped
*NL*
eating
.
And
then
,
perhaps
a
little
ashamed
of
her
rudeness
,
``
It
does
n't
*NL*
matter
;
take
your
time
about
it
;
there
's
no
hurry
;
I
only
reminded
you
*NL*
because
of
the
others
,
you
know
;
it
keeps
the
servants
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
,
''
began
Brichot
,
with
a
resonant
smack
upon
every
syllable
,
``
a
*NL*
rather
curious
definition
of
intelligence
by
that
pleasing
old
anarchist
*NL*
Fénelon
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
listen
to
this
!
''
Mme.
Verdurin
rallied
Forcheville
and
the
Doctor
.
*NL*
``
He
's
going
to
give
us
Fénelon
's
definition
of
intelligence
.
That
's
*NL*
interesting
.
It
's
not
often
you
get
a
chance
of
hearing
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Brichot
was
keeping
Fénelon
's
definition
until
Swann
should
*NL*
have
given
his
own
.
Swann
remained
silent
,
and
,
by
this
fresh
act
of
*NL*
recreancy
,
spoiled
the
brilliant
tournament
of
dialectic
which
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
was
rejoicing
at
being
able
to
offer
to
Forcheville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
it
's
just
the
same
as
with
me
!
''
Odette
was
peevish
.
``
I
'm
not
*NL*
at
all
sorry
to
see
that
I
'm
not
the
only
one
he
does
n't
find
quite
up
*NL*
to
his
level
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
de
La
Trémouailles
whom
Mme.
Verdurin
has
exhibited
to
us
as
so
*NL*
little
to
be
desired
,
''
inquired
Brichot
,
articulating
vigorously
,
``
are
*NL*
they
,
by
any
chance
,
descended
from
the
couple
whom
that
worthy
old
*NL*
snob
,
Sévigné
,
said
she
was
delighted
to
know
,
because
it
was
so
good
*NL*
for
her
peasants
?
True
,
the
Marquise
had
another
reason
,
which
in
her
*NL*
case
probably
came
first
,
for
she
was
a
thorough
journalist
at
heart
,
*NL*
and
always
on
the
look-out
for
`
copy
.
'
And
,
in
the
journal
which
she
*NL*
used
to
send
regularly
to
her
daughter
,
it
was
Mme.
de
La
Trémouaille
,
*NL*
kept
well-informed
through
all
her
grand
connections
,
who
supplied
the
*NL*
foreign
politics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no
.
I
'm
quite
sure
they
are
n't
the
same
family
,
''
said
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
desperately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Saniette
who
,
ever
since
he
had
surrendered
his
untouched
plate
to
the
*NL*
butler
,
had
been
plunged
once
more
in
silent
meditation
,
emerged
finally
*NL*
to
tell
them
,
with
a
nervous
laugh
,
a
story
of
how
he
had
once
dined
*NL*
with
the
Duc
de
La
Trémoïlle
,
the
point
of
which
was
that
the
Duke
*NL*
did
not
know
that
George
Sand
was
the
pseudonym
of
a
woman
.
Swann
,
*NL*
who
really
liked
Saniette
,
felt
bound
to
supply
him
with
a
few
facts
*NL*
illustrative
of
the
Duke
's
culture
,
which
would
prove
that
such
*NL*
ignorance
on
his
part
was
literally
impossible
;
but
suddenly
he
stopped
*NL*
short
;
he
had
realised
,
as
he
was
speaking
,
that
Saniette
needed
no
*NL*
proof
,
but
knew
already
that
the
story
was
untrue
for
the
simple
reason
*NL*
that
he
had
at
that
moment
invented
it
.
The
worthy
man
suffered
acutely
*NL*
from
the
Verdurins
'
always
finding
him
so
dull
;
and
as
he
was
conscious
*NL*
of
having
been
more
than
ordinarily
morose
this
evening
,
he
had
made
up
*NL*
his
mind
that
he
would
succeed
in
being
amusing
,
at
least
once
,
before
*NL*
the
end
of
dinner
.
He
surrendered
so
quickly
,
looked
so
wretched
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
his
castle
in
ruins
,
and
replied
in
so
craven
a
tone
to
Swann
,
*NL*
appealing
to
him
not
to
persist
in
a
refutation
which
was
already
*NL*
superfluous
,
``
All
right
;
all
right
;
anyhow
,
even
if
I
have
made
a
*NL*
mistake
that
's
not
a
crime
,
I
hope
,
''
that
Swann
longed
to
be
able
*NL*
to
console
him
by
insisting
that
the
story
was
indubitably
true
and
*NL*
exquisitely
funny
.
The
Doctor
,
who
had
been
listening
,
had
an
idea
that
*NL*
it
was
the
right
moment
to
interject
''
_
Se
non
è
vero
_
,
''
but
he
was
not
*NL*
quite
certain
of
the
words
,
and
was
afraid
of
being
caught
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
Forcheville
went
up
to
the
Doctor
.
``
She
ca
n't
have
been
*NL*
at
all
bad
looking
,
Mme.
Verdurin
;
anyhow
,
she
's
a
woman
you
can
really
*NL*
talk
to
;
that
's
all
I
want
.
Of
course
she
's
getting
a
bit
broad
in
the
*NL*
beam
.
But
Mme.
de
Crécy
!
There
's
a
little
woman
who
knows
what
's
what
,
*NL*
all
right
.
Upon
my
word
and
soul
,
you
can
see
at
a
glance
she
's
got
*NL*
the
American
eye
,
that
girl
has
.
We
are
speaking
of
Mme.
de
Crécy
,
''
he
*NL*
explained
,
as
M.
Verdurin
joined
them
,
his
pipe
in
his
mouth
.
``
I
should
*NL*
say
that
,
as
a
specimen
of
the
female
form
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
have
it
in
my
bed
than
a
clap
of
thunder
!
''
the
words
came
*NL*
tumbling
from
Cottard
,
who
had
for
some
time
been
waiting
in
vain
until
*NL*
Forcheville
should
pause
for
breath
,
so
that
he
might
get
in
his
hoary
*NL*
old
joke
,
a
chance
for
which
might
not
,
he
feared
,
come
again
,
if
the
*NL*
conversation
should
take
a
different
turn
;
and
he
produced
it
now
with
*NL*
that
excessive
spontaneity
and
confidence
which
may
often
be
noticed
*NL*
attempting
to
cover
up
the
coldness
,
and
the
slight
flutter
of
emotion
,
*NL*
inseparable
from
a
prepared
recitation
.
Forcheville
knew
and
saw
the
*NL*
joke
,
and
was
thoroughly
amused
.
As
for
M.
Verdurin
,
he
was
unsparing
*NL*
of
his
merriment
,
having
recently
discovered
a
way
of
expressing
it
by
*NL*
a
symbol
,
different
from
his
wife
's
,
but
equally
simple
and
obvious
.
*NL*
Scarcely
had
he
begun
the
movement
of
head
and
shoulders
of
a
man
*NL*
who
was
`
shaking
with
laughter
'
than
he
would
begin
also
to
cough
,
as
*NL*
though
,
in
laughing
too
violently
,
he
had
swallowed
a
mouthful
of
smoke
*NL*
from
his
pipe
.
And
by
keeping
the
pipe
firmly
in
his
mouth
he
could
*NL*
prolong
indefinitely
the
dumb-show
of
suffocation
and
hilarity
.
So
he
*NL*
and
Mme.
Verdurin
-LRB-
who
,
at
the
other
side
of
the
room
,
where
the
painter
*NL*
was
telling
her
a
story
,
was
shutting
her
eyes
preparatory
to
flinging
*NL*
her
face
into
her
hands
-RRB-
resembled
two
masks
in
a
theatre
,
each
*NL*
representing
Comedy
,
but
in
a
different
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Verdurin
had
been
wiser
than
he
knew
in
not
taking
his
pipe
out
of
*NL*
his
mouth
,
for
Cottard
,
having
occasion
to
leave
the
room
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
murmured
a
witty
euphemism
which
he
had
recently
acquired
and
repeated
*NL*
now
whenever
he
had
to
go
to
the
place
in
question
:
``
I
must
just
go
and
*NL*
see
the
Duc
d'Aumale
for
a
minute
,
''
so
drolly
,
that
M.
Verdurin
's
cough
*NL*
began
all
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
then
,
take
your
pipe
out
of
your
mouth
;
ca
n't
you
see
,
you
'll
*NL*
choke
if
you
try
to
bottle
up
your
laughter
like
that
,
''
counselled
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
,
as
she
came
round
with
a
tray
of
liqueurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
delightful
man
your
husband
is
;
he
has
the
wit
of
a
dozen
!
''
*NL*
declared
Forcheville
to
Mme.
Cottard
.
``
Thank
you
,
thank
you
,
an
old
*NL*
soldier
like
me
can
never
say
`
No

to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
de
Forcheville
thinks
Odette
charming

''
M.
Verdurin
told
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
do
you
know
,
she
wants
so
much
to
meet
you
again
some
day
at
*NL*
luncheon
.
We
must
arrange
it
,
but
do
n't
on
any
account
let
Swann
hear
*NL*
about
it
.
He
spoils
everything
,
do
n't
you
know
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
*NL*
you
're
not
to
come
to
dinner
too
,
of
course
;
we
hope
to
see
you
very
*NL*
often

Now
that
the
warm
weather
's
coming

we
're
going
to
have
dinner

out
of
doors
whenever
we
can

it

a
quiet
*NL*
little
dinner

now

then

in

splendid

will

be
quite
delightful

*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
going
to
do
any
work
this
evening

I
say
?

she
screamed
*NL*
suddenly
to
the
little
pianist
,
seeing
an
opportunity
for
displaying
,
*NL*
before
a
`
newcomer
'
of
Forcheville
's
importance
,
at
once
her
unfailing
*NL*
wit
and
her
despotic
power
over
the
`
faithful
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
de
Forcheville
was
just
going
to
say
something
dreadful
about
you

''
*NL*
Mme.
Cottard
warned
her
husband
as
he
reappeared
in
the
room
.
And
he
,
*NL*
still
following
up
the
idea
of
Forcheville
's
noble
birth
,
which
had
*NL*
obsessed
him
all
through
dinner
,
began
again
with
:
``
I
am
treating
a
*NL*
Baroness
just
now

Baroness
Putbus

were
n't
there
some
Putbuses
in

*NL*
Crusades
?
Anyhow
they
've
got
a
lake
in
Pomerania
that
's
ten
times
the
*NL*
size
of
the
Place
de

I
am
treating
her
for
dry
arthritis

*NL*
she
's
a
charming
woman

Mme.
Verdurin
knows
her
too

I
believe

*NL*
*NL*
Which
enabled
Forcheville
,
a
moment
later
,
finding
himself
alone
with
*NL*
Mme.
Cottard
,
to
complete
his
favourable
verdict
on
her
husband
with
:
*NL*
``
He
's
an
interesting
man
,
too
;
you
can
see
that
he
knows
some
good
*NL*
people

but
they
get
to
know
a
lot
of
things

those
doctors

*NL*
*NL*
``
D'you
want
me
to
play
the
phrase
from
the
sonata
for
M.
Swann

asked
*NL*
the
pianist

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
devil
's
that
?
Not
the
sonata-snake
,
I
hope
!

shouted
M.
de
*NL*
Forcheville
,
hoping
to
create
an
effect
.
But
Dr.
Cottard
,
who
had
*NL*
never
heard
this
pun
,
missed
the
point
of
it
,
and
imagined
that
M.
de
*NL*
Forcheville
had
made
a
mistake
.
He
dashed
in
boldly
to
correct
it
:
``
No
,
*NL*
no
.
The
word
is
n't
_
serpent-à-sonates

he
*NL*
explained
in
a
tone
at
once
zealous
,
impatient
,
and
triumphant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Forcheville
explained
the
joke
to
him
.
The
Doctor
blushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
admit
it
's
not
bad

Doctor

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
've
known
it
for
ages

*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
were
silenced
;
heralded
by
the
waving
tremolo
of
the
*NL*
violin-part
,
which
formed
a
bristling
bodyguard
of
sound
two
octaves
*NL*
above
it
--
and
as
in
a
mountainous
country
,
against
the
seeming
*NL*
immobility
of
a
vertically
falling
torrent
,
one
may
distinguish
,
two
*NL*
hundred
feet
below
,
the
tiny
form
of
a
woman
walking
in
the
valley
--
the
*NL*
little
phrase
had
just
appeared
,
distant
but
graceful
,
protected
by
*NL*
the
long
,
gradual
unfurling
of
its
transparent
,
incessant
and
sonorous
*NL*
curtain
.
And
Swann
,
in
his
heart
of
hearts
,
turned
to
it
,
spoke
to
it
as
*NL*
to
a
confidant
in
the
secret
of
his
love
,
as
to
a
friend
of
Odette
who
*NL*
would
assure
him
that
he
need
pay
no
attention
to
this
Forcheville
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
've
come
too
late
!
''
Mme.
Verdurin
greeted
one
of
the
`
faithful
,
'
*NL*
whose
invitation
had
been
only
`
to
look
in
after
dinner
,
'
``
we
've
been
*NL*
having
a
simply
incomparable
Brichot
!
You
never
heard
such
eloquence
!
*NL*
But
he
's
gone
.
Is
n't
that
so
,
M.
Swann
?
I
believe
it
's
the
first
time
*NL*
you
've
met
him
,
''
she
went
on
,
to
emphasize
the
fact
that
it
was
to
her
*NL*
that
Swann
owed
the
introduction
.
``
Is
n't
that
so
;
was
n't
he
delicious
,
*NL*
our
Brichot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
bowed
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
?
You
were
n't
interested
?
''
she
asked
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
I
assure
you
,
I
was
quite
enthralled
.
He
is
perhaps
a
little
*NL*
too
peremptory
,
a
little
too
jovial
for
my
taste
.
I
should
like
to
see
*NL*
him
a
little
less
confident
at
times
,
a
little
more
tolerant
,
but
one
*NL*
feels
that
he
knows
a
great
deal
,
and
on
the
whole
he
seems
a
very
sound
*NL*
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
broke
up
very
late
.
Cottard
's
first
words
to
his
wife
were
:
``
I
*NL*
have
rarely
seen
Mme.
Verdurin
in
such
form
as
she
was
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
exactly
is
your
Mme.
Verdurin
?
A
bit
of
a
bad
hat
,
eh
?
''
said
*NL*
Forcheville
to
the
painter
,
to
whom
he
had
offered
a
`
lift
.
'
Odette
*NL*
watched
his
departure
with
regret
;
she
dared
not
refuse
to
let
Swann
*NL*
take
her
home
,
but
she
was
moody
and
irritable
in
the
carriage
,
and
,
*NL*
when
he
asked
whether
he
might
come
in
,
replied
,
``
I
suppose
so
,
''
with
an
*NL*
impatient
shrug
of
her
shoulders
.
When
they
had
all
gone
,
Mme.
Verdurin
*NL*
said
to
her
husband
:
``
Did
you
notice
the
way
Swann
laughed
,
such
an
*NL*
idiotic
laugh
,
when
we
spoke
about
Mme.
La
Trémoïlle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
remarked
,
more
than
once
,
how
Swann
and
Forcheville
suppressed
*NL*
the
particle
`
de
'
before
that
lady
's
name
.
Never
doubting
that
it
was
*NL*
done
on
purpose
,
to
shew
that
they
were
not
afraid
of
a
title
,
she
had
*NL*
made
up
her
mind
to
imitate
their
arrogance
,
but
had
not
quite
*NL*
grasped
what
grammatical
form
it
ought
to
take
.
Moreover
,
the
natural
*NL*
corruptness
of
her
speech
overcoming
her
implacable
republicanism
,
*NL*
she
still
said
instinctively
``
the
de
La
Trémoïlles
,
''
or
,
rather
-LRB-
by
*NL*
an
abbreviation
sanctified
by
the
usage
of
music-hall
singers
and
the
*NL*
writers
of
the
`
captions
'
beneath
caricatures
,
who
elide
the
`
de
'
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
the
d'La
Trémoïlles
,
''
but
she
corrected
herself
at
once
to
``
Madame
La
*NL*
Trémoïlle
.
--
The
_
Duchess
_
,
as
Swann
calls
her
,
''
she
added
ironically
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
which
proved
that
she
was
merely
quoting
,
and
would
not
,
*NL*
herself
,
accept
the
least
responsibility
for
a
classification
so
puerile
*NL*
and
absurd
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
saying
that
I
thought
him
extremely
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Verdurin
took
it
up
.
``
He
's
not
sincere
.
He
's
a
crafty
customer
,
*NL*
always
hovering
between
one
side
and
the
other
.
He
's
always
trying
to
*NL*
run
with
the
hare
and
hunt
with
the
hounds
.
What
a
difference
between
*NL*
him
and
Forcheville
.
There
,
at
least
,
you
have
a
man
who
tells
you
*NL*
straight
out
what
he
thinks
.
Either
you
agree
with
him
or
you
do
n't
.
*NL*
Not
like
the
other
fellow
,
who
's
never
definitely
fish
or
fowl
.
Did
you
*NL*
notice
,
by
the
way
,
that
Odette
seemed
all
out
for
Forcheville
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
blame
her
,
either
.
And
then
,
after
all
,
if
Swann
tries
to
come
*NL*
the
man
of
fashion
over
us
,
the
champion
of
distressed
Duchesses
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
the
other
man
has
got
a
title
;
he
's
always
Comte
de
Forcheville
!
''
*NL*
he
let
the
words
slip
delicately
from
his
lips
,
as
though
,
familiar
with
*NL*
every
page
of
the
history
of
that
dignity
,
he
were
making
a
scrupulously
*NL*
exact
estimate
of
its
value
,
in
relation
to
others
of
the
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
saying
,
''
Mme.
Verdurin
went
on
,
``
that
he
saw
fit
to
utter
*NL*
some
most
venomous
,
and
quite
absurd
insinuations
against
Brichot
.
*NL*
Naturally
,
once
he
saw
that
Brichot
was
popular
in
this
house
,
it
was
a
*NL*
way
of
hitting
back
at
us
,
of
spoiling
our
party
.
I
know
his
sort
,
the
*NL*
dear
,
good
friend
of
the
family
,
who
pulls
you
all
to
pieces
on
the
*NL*
stairs
as
he
's
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
say
so
?
''
retorted
her
husband
.
``
He
's
simply
a
failure
;
a
poor
*NL*
little
wretch
who
goes
through
life
mad
with
jealousy
of
anything
that
's
*NL*
at
all
big
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
truth
been
known
,
there
was
not
one
of
the
`
faithful
'
who
was
*NL*
not
infinitely
more
malicious
than
Swann
;
but
the
others
would
all
take
*NL*
the
precaution
of
tempering
their
malice
with
obvious
pleasantries
,
with
*NL*
little
sparks
of
emotion
and
cordiality
;
while
the
least
indication
of
*NL*
reserve
on
Swann
's
part
,
undraped
in
any
such
conventional
formula
*NL*
as
``
Of
course
,
I
do
n't
want
to
say
anything
--
''
to
which
he
would
have
*NL*
scorned
to
descend
,
appeared
to
them
a
deliberate
act
of
treachery
.
*NL*
There
are
certain
original
and
distinguished
authors
in
whom
the
least
*NL*
`
freedom
of
speech
'
is
thought
revolting
because
they
have
not
begun
*NL*
by
flattering
the
public
taste
,
and
serving
up
to
it
the
commonplace
*NL*
expressions
to
which
it
is
used
;
it
was
by
the
same
process
that
Swann
*NL*
infuriated
M.
Verdurin
.
In
his
case
as
in
theirs
it
was
the
novelty
*NL*
of
his
language
which
led
his
audience
to
suspect
the
blackness
of
his
*NL*
designs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
was
still
unconscious
of
the
disgrace
that
threatened
him
at
the
*NL*
Verdurins
'
,
and
continued
to
regard
all
their
absurdities
in
the
most
*NL*
rosy
light
,
through
the
admiring
eyes
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
rule
he
made
no
appointments
with
Odette
except
for
the
evenings
;
*NL*
he
was
afraid
of
her
growing
tired
of
him
if
he
visited
her
during
the
*NL*
day
as
well
;
at
the
same
time
he
was
reluctant
to
forfeit
,
even
for
*NL*
an
hour
,
the
place
that
he
held
in
her
thoughts
,
and
so
was
constantly
*NL*
looking
out
for
an
opportunity
of
claiming
her
attention
,
in
any
way
*NL*
that
would
not
be
displeasing
to
her
.
If
,
in
a
florist
's
or
a
jeweller
's
*NL*
window
,
a
plant
or
an
ornament
caught
his
eye
,
he
would
at
once
think
*NL*
of
sending
them
to
Odette
,
imagining
that
the
pleasure
which
the
casual
*NL*
sight
of
them
had
given
him
would
instinctively
be
felt
,
also
,
by
her
,
*NL*
and
would
increase
her
affection
for
himself
;
and
he
would
order
them
to
*NL*
be
taken
at
once
to
the
Rue
La
pérouse
,
so
as
to
accelerate
the
moment
*NL*
in
which
,
as
she
received
an
offering
from
him
,
he
might
feel
himself
,
*NL*
in
a
sense
,
transported
into
her
presence
.
He
was
particularly
anxious
,
*NL*
always
,
that
she
should
receive
these
presents
before
she
went
out
*NL*
for
the
evening
,
so
that
her
sense
of
gratitude
towards
him
might
give
*NL*
additional
tenderness
to
her
welcome
when
he
arrived
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
*NL*
might
even
--
for
all
he
knew
--
if
the
shopkeeper
made
haste
,
bring
him
a
*NL*
letter
from
her
before
dinner
,
or
herself
,
in
person
,
upon
his
doorstep
,
*NL*
come
on
a
little
extraordinary
visit
of
thanks
.
As
in
an
earlier
phase
,
*NL*
when
he
had
experimented
with
the
reflex
action
of
anger
and
contempt
*NL*
upon
her
character
,
he
sought
now
by
that
of
gratification
to
elicit
*NL*
from
her
fresh
particles
of
her
intimate
feelings
,
which
she
had
never
*NL*
yet
revealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
she
was
embarrassed
by
lack
of
money
,
and
under
pressure
from
*NL*
a
creditor
would
come
to
him
for
assistance
.
He
enjoyed
this
,
as
he
*NL*
enjoyed
everything
which
could
impress
Odette
with
his
love
for
herself
,
*NL*
or
merely
with
his
influence
,
with
the
extent
of
the
use
that
she
might
*NL*
make
of
him
.
Probably
if
anyone
had
said
to
him
,
at
the
beginning
,
``
It
's
*NL*
your
position
that
attracts
her
,
''
or
at
this
stage
,
``
It
's
your
money
*NL*
that
she
's
really
in
love
with
,
''
he
would
not
have
believed
the
*NL*
suggestion
,
nor
would
he
have
been
greatly
distressed
by
the
thought
*NL*
that
people
supposed
her
to
be
attached
to
him
,
that
people
felt
them
,
*NL*
to
be
united
by
any
ties
so
binding
as
those
of
snobbishness
or
wealth
.
*NL*
But
even
if
he
had
accepted
the
possibility
,
it
might
not
have
caused
*NL*
him
any
suffering
to
discover
that
Odette
's
love
for
him
was
based
on
a
*NL*
foundation
more
lasting
than
mere
affection
,
or
any
attractive
qualities
*NL*
which
she
might
have
found
in
him
;
on
a
sound
,
commercial
interest
;
an
*NL*
interest
which
would
postpone
for
ever
the
fatal
day
on
which
she
might
*NL*
be
tempted
to
bring
their
relations
to
an
end
.
For
the
moment
,
while
*NL*
he
lavished
presents
upon
her
,
and
performed
all
manner
of
services
,
*NL*
he
could
rely
on
advantages
not
contained
in
his
person
,
or
in
his
*NL*
intellect
,
could
forego
the
endless
,
killing
effort
to
make
himself
*NL*
attractive
.
And
this
delight
in
being
a
lover
,
in
living
by
love
alone
,
*NL*
of
the
reality
of
which
he
was
inclined
to
be
doubtful
,
the
price
which
,
*NL*
in
the
long
run
,
he
must
pay
for
it
,
as
a
dilettante
in
immaterial
*NL*
sensations
,
enhanced
its
value
in
his
eyes
--
as
one
sees
people
who
are
*NL*
doubtful
whether
the
sight
of
the
sea
and
the
sound
of
its
waves
are
*NL*
really
enjoyable
,
become
convinced
that
they
are
,
as
also
of
the
rare
*NL*
quality
and
absolute
detachment
of
their
own
taste
,
when
they
have
*NL*
agreed
to
pay
several
pounds
a
day
for
a
room
in
an
hotel
,
from
which
*NL*
that
sight
and
that
sound
may
be
enjoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
reflections
of
this
order
had
brought
him
once
again
to
*NL*
the
memory
of
the
time
when
some
one
had
spoken
to
him
of
Odette
as
of
*NL*
a
`
kept
'
woman
,
and
when
,
once
again
,
he
had
amused
himself
with
*NL*
contrasting
that
strange
personification
,
the
`
kept
'
woman
--
an
*NL*
iridescent
mixture
of
unknown
and
demoniacal
qualities
,
embroidered
,
*NL*
as
in
some
fantasy
of
Gustave
Moreau
,
with
poison-dripping
flowers
,
*NL*
interwoven
with
precious
jewels
--
with
that
Odette
upon
whose
face
he
*NL*
had
watched
the
passage
of
the
same
expressions
of
pity
for
a
sufferer
,
*NL*
resentment
of
an
act
of
injustice
,
gratitude
for
an
act
of
kindness
,
*NL*
which
he
had
seen
,
in
earlier
days
,
on
his
own
mother
's
face
,
and
on
*NL*
the
faces
of
friends
;
that
Odette
,
whose
conversation
had
so
frequently
*NL*
turned
on
the
things
that
he
himself
knew
better
than
anyone
,
his
*NL*
collections
,
his
room
,
his
old
servant
,
his
banker
,
who
kept
all
his
*NL*
title-deeds
and
bonds
;
--
the
thought
of
the
banker
reminded
him
that
he
*NL*
must
call
on
him
shortly
,
to
draw
some
money
.
And
indeed
,
if
,
during
the
*NL*
current
month
,
he
were
to
come
less
liberally
to
the
aid
of
Odette
in
*NL*
her
financial
difficulties
than
in
the
month
before
,
when
he
had
given
*NL*
her
five
thousand
francs
,
if
he
refrained
from
offering
her
a
diamond
*NL*
necklace
for
which
she
longed
,
he
would
be
allowing
her
admiration
for
*NL*
his
generosity
to
decline
,
that
gratitude
which
had
made
him
so
happy
,
*NL*
and
would
even
be
running
the
risk
of
her
imagining
that
his
love
*NL*
for
her
-LRB-
as
she
saw
its
visible
manifestations
grow
fewer
-RRB-
had
itself
*NL*
diminished
.
And
then
,
suddenly
,
he
asked
himself
whether
that
was
not
*NL*
precisely
what
was
implied
by
`
keeping
'
a
woman
-LRB-
as
if
,
in
fact
,
that
*NL*
idea
of
`
keeping
'
could
be
derived
from
elements
not
at
all
mysterious
*NL*
nor
perverse
,
but
belonging
to
the
intimate
routine
of
his
daily
life
,
*NL*
such
as
that
thousand-franc
note
,
a
familiar
and
domestic
object
,
torn
*NL*
in
places
and
mended
with
gummed
paper
,
which
his
valet
,
after
paying
*NL*
the
household
accounts
and
the
rent
,
had
locked
up
in
a
drawer
in
*NL*
the
old
writing-desk
whence
he
had
extracted
it
to
send
it
,
with
four
*NL*
others
,
to
Odette
-RRB-
and
whether
it
was
not
possible
to
apply
to
Odette
,
*NL*
since
he
had
known
her
-LRB-
for
he
never
imagined
for
a
moment
that
she
*NL*
could
ever
have
taken
a
penny
from
anyone
else
,
before
-RRB-
,
that
title
,
*NL*
which
he
had
believed
so
wholly
inapplicable
to
her
,
of
`
kept
'
woman
.
He
*NL*
could
not
explore
the
idea
further
,
for
a
sudden
access
of
that
mental
*NL*
lethargy
which
was
,
with
him
,
congenital
,
intermittent
and
providential
,
*NL*
happened
,
at
that
moment
,
to
extinguish
every
particle
of
light
in
his
*NL*
brain
,
as
instantaneously
as
,
at
a
later
period
,
when
electric
lighting
*NL*
had
been
everywhere
installed
,
it
became
possible
,
merely
by
fingering
*NL*
a
switch
,
to
cut
off
all
the
supply
of
light
from
a
house
.
His
mind
*NL*
fumbled
,
for
a
moment
,
in
the
darkness
,
he
took
off
his
spectacles
,
*NL*
wiped
the
glasses
,
passed
his
hands
over
his
eyes
,
but
saw
no
light
*NL*
until
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
wholly
different
idea
,
the
*NL*
realisation
that
he
must
endeavour
,
in
the
coming
month
,
to
send
Odette
*NL*
six
or
seven
thousand-franc
notes
instead
of
five
,
simply
as
a
surprise
*NL*
for
her
and
to
give
her
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
when
he
did
not
stay
at
home
until
it
was
time
to
meet
*NL*
Odette
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
or
rather
at
one
of
the
open-air
restaurants
*NL*
which
they
liked
to
frequent
in
the
Bois
and
especially
at
Saint-Cloud
,
*NL*
he
would
go
to
dine
in
one
of
those
fashionable
houses
in
which
,
at
one
*NL*
time
,
he
had
been
a
constant
guest
.
He
did
not
wish
to
lose
touch
with
*NL*
people
who
,
for
all
that
he
knew
,
might
be
of
use
,
some
day
,
to
Odette
,
*NL*
and
thanks
to
whom
he
was
often
,
in
the
meantime
,
able
to
procure
for
*NL*
her
some
privilege
or
pleasure
.
Besides
,
he
had
been
used
for
so
long
to
*NL*
the
refinement
and
comfort
of
good
society
that
,
side
by
side
with
his
*NL*
contempt
,
there
had
grown
up
also
a
desperate
need
for
it
,
with
the
*NL*
result
that
,
when
he
had
reached
the
point
after
which
the
humblest
*NL*
lodgings
appeared
to
him
as
precisely
on
a
par
with
the
most
princely
*NL*
mansions
,
his
senses
were
so
thoroughly
accustomed
to
the
latter
that
he
*NL*
could
not
enter
the
former
without
a
feeling
of
acute
discomfort
.
He
*NL*
had
the
same
regard
--
to
a
degree
of
identity
which
they
would
never
have
*NL*
suspected
--
for
the
little
families
with
small
incomes
who
asked
him
to
*NL*
dances
in
their
flats
-LRB-
``
straight
upstairs
to
the
fifth
floor
,
and
the
*NL*
door
on
the
left
''
-RRB-
as
for
the
Princesse
de
Parme
,
who
gave
the
most
*NL*
splendid
parties
in
Paris
;
but
he
had
not
the
feeling
of
being
actually
*NL*
`
at
the
ball
'
when
he
found
himself
herded
with
the
fathers
of
families
*NL*
in
the
bedroom
of
the
lady
of
the
house
,
while
the
spectacle
of
*NL*
wash-hand-stands
covered
over
with
towels
,
and
of
beds
converted
into
*NL*
cloak-rooms
,
with
a
mass
of
hats
and
great-coats
sprawling
over
their
*NL*
counterpanes
,
gave
him
the
same
stifling
sensation
that
,
nowadays
,
*NL*
people
who
have
been
used
for
half
a
lifetime
to
electric
light
derive
*NL*
from
a
smoking
lamp
or
a
candle
that
needs
to
be
snuffed
.
If
he
were
*NL*
dining
out
,
he
would
order
his
carriage
for
half-past
seven
;
while
he
*NL*
changed
his
clothes
,
he
would
be
wondering
,
all
the
time
,
about
Odette
,
*NL*
and
in
this
way
was
never
alone
,
for
the
constant
thought
of
Odette
*NL*
gave
to
the
moments
in
which
he
was
separated
from
her
the
same
peculiar
*NL*
charm
as
to
those
in
which
she
was
at
his
side
.
He
would
get
into
his
*NL*
carriage
and
drive
off
,
but
he
knew
that
this
thought
had
jumped
in
*NL*
after
him
and
had
settled
down
upon
his
knee
,
like
a
pet
animal
which
*NL*
he
might
take
everywhere
,
and
would
keep
with
him
at
the
dinner-table
,
*NL*
unobserved
by
his
fellow-guests
.
He
would
stroke
and
fondle
it
,
warm
*NL*
himself
with
it
,
and
,
as
a
feeling
of
languor
swept
over
him
,
would
*NL*
give
way
to
a
slight
shuddering
movement
which
contracted
his
throat
*NL*
and
nostrils
--
a
new
experience
,
this
,
--
as
he
fastened
the
bunch
of
*NL*
columbines
in
his
buttonhole
.
He
had
for
some
time
been
feeling
neither
*NL*
well
nor
happy
,
especially
since
Odette
had
brought
Forcheville
to
the
*NL*
Verdurins
'
,
and
he
would
have
liked
to
go
away
for
a
while
to
rest
in
*NL*
the
country
.
But
he
could
never
summon
up
courage
to
leave
Paris
,
even
*NL*
for
a
day
,
while
Odette
was
there
.
The
weather
was
warm
;
it
was
the
*NL*
finest
part
of
the
spring
.
And
for
all
that
he
was
driving
through
a
*NL*
city
of
stone
to
immure
himself
in
a
house
without
grass
or
garden
,
what
*NL*
was
incessantly
before
his
eyes
was
a
park
which
he
owned
,
near
Combray
,
*NL*
where
,
at
four
in
the
afternoon
,
before
coming
to
the
asparagus-bed
,
*NL*
thanks
to
the
breeze
that
was
wafted
across
the
fields
from
Méséglise
,
*NL*
he
could
enjoy
the
fragrant
coolness
of
the
air
as
well
beneath
an
*NL*
arbour
of
hornbeams
in
the
garden
as
by
the
bank
of
the
pond
,
fringed
*NL*
with
forget-me-not
and
iris
;
and
where
,
when
he
sat
down
to
dinner
,
*NL*
trained
and
twined
by
the
gardener
's
skilful
hand
,
there
ran
all
about
*NL*
his
table
currant-bush
and
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
if
he
had
an
early
appointment
in
the
Bois
or
at
*NL*
Saint-Cloud
,
he
would
rise
from
table
and
leave
the
house
so
*NL*
abruptly
--
especially
if
it
threatened
to
rain
,
and
so
to
scatter
the
*NL*
`
faithful
'
before
their
normal
time
--
that
on
one
occasion
the
Princesse
*NL*
des
Laumes
-LRB-
at
whose
house
dinner
had
been
so
late
that
Swann
had
left
*NL*
before
the
coffee
came
in
,
to
join
the
Verdurins
on
the
Island
in
the
*NL*
Bois
-RRB-
observed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
if
Swann
were
thirty
years
older
,
and
had
diabetes
,
there
might
*NL*
be
some
excuse
for
his
running
away
like
that
.
He
seems
to
look
upon
us
*NL*
all
as
a
joke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
persuaded
himself
that
the
spring-time
charm
,
which
he
could
not
go
*NL*
down
to
Combray
to
enjoy
,
he
would
find
at
least
on
the
He
des
Cygnes
*NL*
or
at
Saint-Cloud
.
But
as
he
could
think
only
of
Odette
,
he
would
*NL*
return
home
not
knowing
even
if
he
had
tasted
the
fragrance
of
the
young
*NL*
leaves
,
or
if
the
moon
had
been
shining
.
He
would
be
welcomed
by
the
*NL*
little
phrase
from
the
sonata
,
played
in
the
garden
on
the
restaurant
*NL*
piano
.
If
there
was
none
in
the
garden
,
the
Verdurins
would
have
taken
*NL*
immense
pains
to
have
a
piano
brought
out
either
from
a
private
room
*NL*
or
from
the
restaurant
itself
;
not
because
Swann
was
now
restored
to
*NL*
favour
;
far
from
it
.
But
the
idea
of
arranging
an
ingenious
form
of
*NL*
entertainment
for
some
one
,
even
for
some
one
whom
they
disliked
,
would
*NL*
stimulate
them
,
during
the
time
spent
in
its
preparation
,
to
a
momentary
*NL*
sense
of
cordiality
and
affection
.
Now
and
then
he
would
remind
himself
*NL*
that
another
fine
spring
evening
was
drawing
to
a
close
,
and
would
force
*NL*
himself
to
notice
the
trees
and
the
sky
.
But
the
state
of
excitement
*NL*
into
which
Odette
's
presence
never
failed
to
throw
him
,
added
to
a
*NL*
feverish
ailment
which
,
for
some
time
now
,
had
scarcely
left
him
,
*NL*
robbed
him
of
that
sense
of
quiet
and
comfort
which
is
an
indispensable
*NL*
background
to
the
impressions
that
we
derive
from
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
when
Swann
had
consented
to
dine
with
the
Verdurins
,
and
*NL*
had
mentioned
during
dinner
that
he
had
to
attend
,
next
day
,
the
annual
*NL*
banquet
of
an
old
comrades
'
association
,
Odette
had
at
once
exclaimed
*NL*
across
the
table
,
in
front
of
everyone
,
in
front
of
Forcheville
,
who
was
*NL*
now
one
of
the
`
faithful
,
'
in
front
of
the
painter
,
in
front
of
Cottard
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
,
you
have
your
banquet
to-morrow
;
I
sha
'n'
t
see
you
,
then
,
*NL*
till
I
get
home
;
do
n't
be
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
although
Swann
had
never
yet
taken
offence
,
at
all
seriously
,
*NL*
at
Odette
's
demonstrations
of
friendship
for
one
or
other
of
the
*NL*
`
faithful
,
'
he
felt
an
exquisite
pleasure
on
hearing
her
thus
avow
,
*NL*
before
them
all
,
with
that
calm
immodesty
,
the
fact
that
they
saw
each
*NL*
other
regularly
every
evening
,
his
privileged
position
in
her
house
,
and
*NL*
her
own
preference
for
him
which
it
implied
.
It
was
true
that
Swann
had
*NL*
often
reflected
that
Odette
was
in
no
way
a
remarkable
woman
;
and
in
*NL*
the
supremacy
which
he
wielded
over
a
creature
so
distinctly
inferior
to
*NL*
himself
there
was
nothing
that
especially
flattered
him
when
he
heard
*NL*
it
proclaimed
to
all
the
`
faithful
'
;
but
since
he
had
observed
that
,
*NL*
to
several
other
men
than
himself
,
Odette
seemed
a
fascinating
and
*NL*
desirable
woman
,
the
attraction
which
her
body
held
for
him
had
aroused
*NL*
a
painful
longing
to
secure
the
absolute
mastery
of
even
the
tiniest
*NL*
particles
of
her
heart
.
And
he
had
begun
to
attach
an
incalculable
value
*NL*
to
those
moments
passed
in
her
house
in
the
evenings
,
when
he
held
her
*NL*
upon
his
knee
,
made
her
tell
him
what
she
thought
about
this
or
that
,
*NL*
and
counted
over
that
treasure
to
which
,
alone
of
all
his
earthly
*NL*
possessions
,
he
still
clung
.
And
so
,
after
this
dinner
,
drawing
her
*NL*
aside
,
he
took
care
to
thank
her
effusively
,
seeking
to
indicate
to
*NL*
her
by
the
extent
of
his
gratitude
the
corresponding
intensity
of
*NL*
the
pleasures
which
it
was
in
her
power
to
bestow
on
him
,
the
supreme
*NL*
pleasure
being
to
guarantee
him
immunity
,
for
as
long
as
his
love
should
*NL*
last
and
he
remain
vulnerable
,
from
the
assaults
of
jealousy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
away
from
his
banquet
,
the
next
evening
,
it
was
pouring
*NL*
rain
,
and
he
had
nothing
but
his
victoria
.
A
friend
offered
to
take
*NL*
him
home
in
a
closed
carriage
,
and
as
Odette
,
by
the
fact
of
her
having
*NL*
invited
him
to
come
,
had
given
him
an
assurance
that
she
was
expecting
*NL*
no
one
else
,
he
could
,
with
a
quiet
mind
and
an
untroubled
heart
,
rather
*NL*
than
set
off
thus
in
the
rain
,
have
gone
home
and
to
bed
.
But
perhaps
,
*NL*
if
she
saw
that
he
seemed
not
to
adhere
to
his
resolution
to
end
every
*NL*
evening
,
without
exception
,
in
her
company
,
she
might
grow
careless
,
and
*NL*
fail
to
keep
free
for
him
just
the
one
evening
on
which
he
particularly
*NL*
desired
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
after
eleven
when
he
reached
her
door
,
and
as
he
made
his
apology
*NL*
for
having
been
unable
to
come
away
earlier
,
she
complained
that
it
was
*NL*
indeed
very
late
;
the
storm
had
made
her
unwell
,
her
head
ached
,
and
*NL*
she
warned
him
that
she
would
not
let
him
stay
longer
than
half
an
hour
,
*NL*
that
at
midnight
she
would
send
him
away
;
a
little
while
later
she
felt
*NL*
tired
and
wished
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
cattleya
,
then
,
to-night
?
''
he
asked
,
``
and
I
've
been
looking
forward
*NL*
so
to
a
nice
little
cattleya
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
irresponsive
;
saying
nervously
:
``
No
,
dear
,
no
cattleya
*NL*
tonight
.
Ca
n't
you
see
,
I
'm
not
well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
have
done
you
good
,
but
I
wo
n't
bother
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
begged
him
to
put
out
the
light
before
he
went
;
he
drew
the
curtains
*NL*
close
round
her
bed
and
left
her
.
But
,
when
he
was
in
his
own
house
*NL*
again
,
the
idea
suddenly
struck
him
that
,
perhaps
,
Odette
was
expecting
*NL*
some
one
else
that
evening
,
that
she
had
merely
pretended
to
be
tired
,
*NL*
that
she
had
asked
him
to
put
the
light
out
only
so
that
he
should
*NL*
suppose
that
she
was
going
to
sleep
,
that
the
moment
he
had
left
*NL*
the
house
she
had
lighted
it
again
,
and
had
reopened
her
door
to
the
*NL*
stranger
who
was
to
be
her
guest
for
the
night
.
He
looked
at
his
watch
.
*NL*
It
was
about
an
hour
and
a
half
since
he
had
left
her
;
he
went
out
,
took
*NL*
a
cab
,
and
stopped
it
close
to
her
house
,
in
a
little
street
running
at
*NL*
right
angles
to
that
other
street
,
which
lay
at
the
back
of
her
house
,
*NL*
and
along
which
he
used
to
go
,
sometimes
,
to
tap
upon
her
bedroom
*NL*
window
,
for
her
to
let
him
in
.
He
left
his
cab
;
the
streets
were
all
*NL*
deserted
and
dark
;
he
walked
a
few
yards
and
came
out
almost
opposite
*NL*
her
house
.
Amid
the
glimmering
blackness
of
all
the
row
of
windows
,
the
*NL*
lights
in
which
had
long
since
been
put
out
,
he
saw
one
,
and
only
one
,
*NL*
from
which
overflowed
,
between
the
slats
of
its
shutters
,
dosed
like
a
*NL*
wine-press
over
its
mysterious
golden
juice
,
the
light
that
filled
the
*NL*
room
within
,
a
light
which
on
so
many
evenings
,
as
soon
as
he
saw
it
,
*NL*
far
off
,
as
he
turned
into
the
street
,
had
rejoiced
his
heart
with
its
*NL*
message
:
``
She
is
there
--
expecting
you
,
''
and
now
tortured
him
with
:
``
She
*NL*
is
there
with
the
man
she
was
expecting
.
''
He
must
know
who
;
he
tiptoed
*NL*
along
by
the
wall
until
he
reached
the
window
,
but
between
the
slanting
*NL*
bars
of
the
shutters
he
could
see
nothing
;
he
could
hear
,
only
,
in
the
*NL*
silence
of
the
night
,
the
murmur
of
conversation
.
What
agony
he
suffered
*NL*
as
he
watched
that
light
,
in
whose
golden
atmosphere
were
moving
,
behind
*NL*
the
closed
sash
,
the
unseen
and
detested
pair
,
as
he
listened
to
that
*NL*
murmur
which
revealed
the
presence
of
the
man
who
had
crept
in
after
his
*NL*
own
departure
,
the
perfidy
of
Odette
,
and
the
pleasures
which
she
was
at
*NL*
that
moment
tasting
with
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
was
not
sorry
that
he
had
come
;
the
torment
which
had
forced
*NL*
him
to
leave
his
own
house
had
lost
its
sharpness
when
it
lost
its
*NL*
uncertainty
,
now
that
Odette
's
other
life
,
of
which
he
had
had
,
at
that
*NL*
first
moment
,
a
sudden
helpless
suspicion
,
was
definitely
there
,
almost
*NL*
within
his
grasp
,
before
his
eyes
,
in
the
full
glare
of
the
lamp-light
,
*NL*
caught
and
kept
there
,
an
unwitting
prisoner
,
in
that
room
into
which
,
*NL*
when
he
would
,
he
might
force
his
way
to
surprise
and
seize
it
;
or
*NL*
rather
he
would
tap
upon
the
shutters
,
as
he
had
often
done
when
he
had
*NL*
come
there
very
late
,
and
by
that
signal
Odette
would
at
least
learn
*NL*
that
he
knew
,
that
he
had
seen
the
light
and
had
heard
the
voices
;
while
*NL*
he
himself
,
who
a
moment
ago
had
been
picturing
her
as
laughing
at
him
,
*NL*
as
sharing
with
that
other
the
knowledge
of
how
effectively
he
had
been
*NL*
tricked
,
now
it
was
he
that
saw
them
,
confident
and
persistent
in
*NL*
their
error
,
tricked
and
trapped
by
none
other
than
himself
,
whom
they
*NL*
believed
to
be
a
mile
away
,
but
who
was
there
,
in
person
,
there
with
a
*NL*
plan
,
there
with
the
knowledge
that
he
was
going
,
in
another
minute
,
to
*NL*
tap
upon
the
shutter
.
And
,
perhaps
,
what
he
felt
-LRB-
almost
an
agreeable
*NL*
feeling
-RRB-
at
that
moment
was
something
more
than
relief
at
the
solution
*NL*
of
a
doubt
,
at
the
soothing
of
a
pain
;
was
an
intellectual
pleasure
.
*NL*
If
,
since
he
had
fallen
in
love
,
things
had
recovered
a
little
of
the
*NL*
delicate
attraction
that
they
had
had
for
him
long
ago
--
though
only
when
*NL*
a
light
was
shed
upon
them
by
a
thought
,
a
memory
of
Odette
--
now
it
was
*NL*
another
of
the
faculties
,
prominent
in
the
studious
days
of
his
youth
,
*NL*
that
Odette
had
quickened
with
new
life
,
the
passion
for
truth
,
but
for
*NL*
a
truth
which
,
too
,
was
interposed
between
himself
and
his
mistress
,
*NL*
receiving
its
light
from
her
alone
,
a
private
and
personal
truth
the
*NL*
sole
object
of
which
-LRB-
an
infinitely
precious
object
,
and
one
almost
*NL*
impersonal
in
its
absolute
beauty
-RRB-
was
Odette
--
Odette
in
her
activities
,
*NL*
her
environment
,
her
projects
,
and
her
past
.
At
every
other
period
in
*NL*
his
life
,
the
little
everyday
words
and
actions
of
another
person
had
*NL*
always
seemed
wholly
valueless
to
Swann
;
if
gossip
about
such
things
*NL*
were
repeated
to
him
,
he
would
dismiss
it
as
insignificant
,
and
while
he
*NL*
listened
it
was
only
the
lowest
,
the
most
commonplace
part
of
his
*NL*
mind
that
was
interested
;
at
such
moments
he
felt
utterly
dull
and
*NL*
uninspired
.
But
in
this
strange
phase
of
love
the
personality
of
another
*NL*
person
becomes
so
enlarged
,
so
deepened
,
that
the
curiosity
which
*NL*
he
could
now
feel
aroused
in
himself
,
to
know
the
least
details
of
a
*NL*
woman
's
daily
occupation
,
was
the
same
thirst
for
knowledge
with
which
*NL*
he
had
once
studied
history
.
And
all
manner
of
actions
,
from
which
,
*NL*
until
now
,
he
would
have
recoiled
in
shame
,
such
as
spying
,
to-night
,
*NL*
outside
a
window
,
to-morrow
,
for
all
he
knew
,
putting
adroitly
*NL*
provocative
questions
to
casual
witnesses
,
bribing
servants
,
listening
*NL*
at
doors
,
seemed
to
him
,
now
,
to
be
precisely
on
a
level
with
the
*NL*
deciphering
of
manuscripts
,
the
weighing
of
evidence
,
the
interpretation
*NL*
of
old
monuments
,
that
was
to
say
,
so
many
different
methods
of
*NL*
scientific
investigation
,
each
one
having
a
definite
intellectual
value
*NL*
and
being
legitimately
employable
in
the
search
for
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
his
hand
stole
out
towards
the
shutters
he
felt
a
pang
of
shame
at
*NL*
the
thought
that
Odette
would
now
know
that
he
had
suspected
her
,
that
*NL*
he
had
returned
,
that
he
had
posted
himself
outside
her
window
.
She
*NL*
had
often
told
him
what
a
horror
she
had
of
jealous
men
,
of
lovers
who
*NL*
spied
.
What
he
was
going
to
do
would
be
extremely
awkward
,
and
she
would
*NL*
detest
him
for
ever
after
,
whereas
now
,
for
the
moment
,
for
so
long
as
*NL*
he
refrained
from
knocking
,
perhaps
even
in
the
act
of
infidelity
,
she
*NL*
loved
him
still
.
How
often
is
not
the
prospect
of
future
happiness
*NL*
thus
sacrificed
to
one
's
impatient
insistence
upon
an
immediate
*NL*
gratification
.
But
his
desire
to
know
the
truth
was
stronger
,
and
seemed
*NL*
to
him
nobler
than
his
desire
for
her
.
He
knew
that
the
true
story
*NL*
of
certain
events
,
which
he
would
have
given
his
life
to
be
able
to
*NL*
reconstruct
accurately
and
in
full
,
was
to
be
read
within
that
window
,
*NL*
streaked
with
bars
of
light
,
as
within
the
illuminated
,
golden
boards
of
*NL*
one
of
those
precious
manuscripts
,
by
whose
wealth
of
artistic
treasures
*NL*
the
scholar
who
consults
them
can
not
remain
unmoved
.
He
yearned
for
*NL*
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
the
truth
which
so
impassioned
him
in
that
*NL*
brief
,
fleeting
,
precious
transcript
,
on
that
translucent
page
,
so
warm
,
*NL*
so
beautiful
.
And
besides
,
the
advantage
which
he
felt
--
which
he
so
*NL*
desperately
wanted
to
feel
--
that
he
had
over
them
,
lay
perhaps
not
so
*NL*
much
in
knowing
as
in
being
able
to
shew
them
that
he
knew
.
He
drew
*NL*
himself
up
on
tiptoe
.
He
knocked
.
They
had
not
heard
;
he
knocked
again
;
*NL*
louder
;
their
conversation
ceased
.
A
man
's
voice
--
he
strained
his
ears
*NL*
to
distinguish
whose
,
among
such
of
Odette
's
friends
as
he
knew
,
the
*NL*
voice
could
be
--
asked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
be
certain
of
the
voice
.
He
knocked
once
again
.
The
window
*NL*
first
,
then
the
shutters
were
thrown
open
.
It
was
too
late
,
now
,
to
*NL*
retire
,
and
since
she
must
know
all
,
so
as
not
to
seem
too
contemptible
,
*NL*
too
jealous
and
inquisitive
,
he
called
out
in
a
careless
,
hearty
,
*NL*
welcoming
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
bother
;
I
just
happened
to
be
passing
,
and
saw
the
light
.
*NL*
I
wanted
to
know
if
you
were
feeling
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
up
.
Two
old
gentlemen
stood
facing
him
,
in
the
window
,
one
*NL*
of
them
with
a
lamp
in
his
hand
;
and
beyond
them
he
could
see
into
*NL*
the
room
,
a
room
that
he
had
never
seen
before
.
Having
fallen
into
the
*NL*
habit
,
When
he
came
late
to
Odette
,
of
identifying
her
window
by
*NL*
the
fact
that
it
was
the
only
one
still
lighted
in
a
row
of
windows
*NL*
otherwise
all
alike
,
he
had
been
misled
,
this
time
,
by
the
light
,
and
*NL*
had
knocked
at
the
window
beyond
hers
,
in
the
adjoining
house
.
He
made
*NL*
what
apology
he
could
and
hurried
home
,
overjoyed
that
the
satisfaction
*NL*
of
his
curiosity
had
preserved
their
love
intact
,
and
that
,
having
*NL*
feigned
for
so
long
,
when
in
Odette
's
company
,
a
sort
of
indifference
,
*NL*
he
had
not
now
,
by
a
demonstration
of
jealousy
,
given
her
that
proof
*NL*
of
the
excess
of
his
own
passion
which
,
in
a
pair
of
lovers
,
fully
and
*NL*
finally
dispenses
the
recipient
from
the
obligation
to
love
the
other
*NL*
enough
.
He
never
spoke
to
her
of
this
misadventure
,
he
ceased
even
to
*NL*
think
of
it
himself
.
But
now
and
then
his
thoughts
in
their
wandering
*NL*
course
would
come
upon
this
memory
where
it
lay
unobserved
,
would
*NL*
startle
it
into
life
,
thrust
it
more
deeply
down
into
his
consciousness
,
*NL*
and
leave
him
aching
with
a
sharp
,
far-rooted
pain
.
As
though
this
had
*NL*
been
a
bodily
pain
,
Swann
's
mind
was
powerless
to
alleviate
it
;
in
the
*NL*
case
of
bodily
pain
,
however
,
since
it
is
independent
of
the
mind
,
the
*NL*
mind
can
dwell
upon
it
,
can
note
that
it
has
diminished
,
that
it
has
*NL*
momentarily
ceased
.
But
with
this
mental
pain
,
the
mind
,
merely
by
*NL*
recalling
it
,
created
it
afresh
.
To
determine
not
to
think
of
it
was
but
*NL*
to
think
of
it
still
,
to
suffer
from
it
still
.
And
when
,
in
conversation
*NL*
with
his
friends
,
he
forgot
his
sufferings
,
suddenly
a
word
casually
*NL*
uttered
would
make
him
change
countenance
as
a
wounded
man
does
when
a
*NL*
clumsy
hand
has
touched
his
aching
limb
.
When
he
came
away
from
Odette
,
*NL*
he
was
happy
,
he
felt
calm
,
he
recalled
the
smile
with
which
,
in
gentle
*NL*
mockery
,
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
this
man
or
of
that
,
a
smile
which
was
*NL*
all
tenderness
for
himself
;
he
recalled
the
gravity
of
her
head
which
*NL*
she
seemed
to
have
lifted
from
its
axis
to
let
it
droop
and
fall
,
as
*NL*
though
against
her
will
,
upon
his
lips
,
as
she
had
done
on
that
first
*NL*
evening
in
the
carriage
;
her
languishing
gaze
at
him
while
she
lay
*NL*
nestling
in
his
arms
,
her
bended
head
seeming
to
recede
between
her
*NL*
shoulders
,
as
though
shrinking
from
the
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
,
at
once
,
his
jealousy
,
as
it
had
been
the
shadow
of
his
love
,
*NL*
presented
him
with
the
complement
,
with
the
converse
of
that
new
smile
*NL*
with
which
she
had
greeted
him
that
very
evening
,
--
with
which
,
now
,
*NL*
perversely
,
she
was
mocking
Swann
while
she
tendered
her
love
to
*NL*
another
--
of
that
lowering
of
her
head
,
but
lowered
now
to
fall
on
other
*NL*
lips
,
and
-LRB-
but
bestowed
upon
a
stranger
-RRB-
of
all
the
marks
of
affection
*NL*
that
she
had
shewn
to
him
.
And
all
these
voluptuous
memories
which
he
*NL*
bore
away
from
her
house
were
,
as
one
might
say
,
but
so
many
sketches
,
*NL*
rough
plans
,
like
the
schemes
of
decoration
which
a
designer
submits
to
*NL*
one
in
outline
,
enabling
Swann
to
form
an
idea
of
the
various
attitudes
,
*NL*
aflame
or
faint
with
passion
,
which
she
was
capable
of
adopting
for
*NL*
others
.
With
the
result
that
he
came
to
regret
every
pleasure
that
he
*NL*
tasted
in
her
company
,
every
new
caress
that
he
invented
-LRB-
and
had
been
*NL*
so
imprudent
as
to
point
out
to
her
how
delightful
it
was
-RRB-
,
every
fresh
*NL*
charm
that
he
found
in
her
,
for
he
knew
that
,
a
moment
later
,
they
*NL*
would
go
to
enrich
the
collection
of
instruments
in
his
secret
*NL*
torture-chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fresh
turn
was
given
to
the
screw
when
Swann
recalled
a
sudden
*NL*
expression
which
he
had
intercepted
,
a
few
days
earlier
,
and
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
in
Odette
's
eyes
.
It
was
after
dinner
at
the
Verdurins
'
.
*NL*
Whether
it
was
because
Forcheville
,
aware
that
Saniette
,
his
*NL*
brother-in-law
,
was
not
in
favour
with
them
,
had
decided
to
make
a
butt
*NL*
of
him
,
and
to
shine
at
his
expense
,
or
because
he
had
been
annoyed
*NL*
by
some
awkward
remark
which
Saniette
had
made
to
him
,
although
it
had
*NL*
passed
unnoticed
by
the
rest
of
the
party
who
knew
nothing
of
whatever
*NL*
tactless
allusion
it
might
conceal
,
or
possibly
because
he
had
been
for
*NL*
some
time
looking
out
for
an
opportunity
of
securing
the
expulsion
from
*NL*
the
house
of
a
fellow-guest
who
knew
rather
too
much
about
him
,
and
*NL*
whom
he
knew
to
be
so
nice-minded
that
he
himself
could
not
help
feeling
*NL*
embarrassed
at
times
merely
by
his
presence
in
the
room
,
Forcheville
*NL*
replied
to
Saniette
's
tactless
utterance
with
such
a
volley
of
abuse
,
*NL*
going
out
of
his
way
to
insult
him
,
emboldened
,
the
louder
he
shouted
,
*NL*
by
the
fear
,
the
pain
,
the
entreaties
of
his
victim
,
that
the
poor
*NL*
creature
,
after
asking
Mme.
Verdurin
whether
he
should
stay
and
*NL*
receiving
no
answer
,
had
left
the
house
in
stammering
confusion
and
with
*NL*
tears
in
his
eyes
.
Odette
had
looked
on
,
impassive
,
at
this
scene
;
but
*NL*
when
the
door
had
closed
behind
Saniette
,
she
had
forced
the
normal
*NL*
expression
of
her
face
down
,
as
the
saying
is
,
by
several
pegs
,
so
as
to
*NL*
bring
herself
on
to
the
same
level
of
vulgarity
as
Forcheville
;
her
eyes
*NL*
had
sparkled
with
a
malicious
smile
of
congratulation
upon
his
audacity
,
*NL*
of
ironical
pity
for
the
poor
wretch
who
had
been
its
victim
;
she
*NL*
had
darted
at
him
a
look
of
complicity
in
the
crime
,
which
so
clearly
*NL*
implied
:
``
That
's
finished
him
off
,
or
I
'm
very
much
mistaken
.
Did
you
*NL*
see
what
a
fool
he
looked
?
He
was
actually
crying
,
''
that
Forcheville
,
*NL*
when
his
eyes
met
hers
,
sobered
in
a
moment
from
the
anger
,
or
pretended
*NL*
anger
with
which
he
was
still
flushed
,
smiled
as
he
explained
:
``
He
need
*NL*
only
have
made
himself
pleasant
and
he
'd
have
been
here
still
;
a
good
*NL*
scolding
does
a
man
no
harm
,
at
any
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
when
Swann
had
gone
out
early
in
the
afternoon
to
pay
a
call
,
*NL*
and
had
failed
to
find
the
person
at
home
whom
he
wished
to
see
,
it
*NL*
occurred
to
him
to
go
,
instead
,
to
Odette
,
at
an
hour
when
,
although
he
*NL*
never
went
to
her
house
then
as
a
rule
,
he
knew
that
she
was
always
at
*NL*
home
,
resting
or
writing
letters
until
tea-time
,
and
would
enjoy
seeing
*NL*
her
for
a
moment
,
if
it
did
not
disturb
her
.
The
porter
told
him
that
he
*NL*
believed
Odette
to
be
in
;
Swann
rang
the
bell
,
thought
that
he
heard
a
*NL*
sound
,
that
he
heard
footsteps
,
but
no
one
came
to
the
door
.
Anxious
and
*NL*
annoyed
,
he
went
round
to
the
other
little
street
,
at
the
back
of
her
*NL*
house
,
and
stood
beneath
her
bedroom
window
;
the
curtains
were
drawn
and
*NL*
he
could
see
nothing
;
he
knocked
loudly
upon
the
pane
,
he
shouted
;
still
*NL*
no
one
came
.
He
could
see
that
the
neighbours
were
staring
at
him
.
He
*NL*
turned
away
,
thinking
that
,
after
all
,
he
had
perhaps
been
mistaken
in
*NL*
believing
that
he
heard
footsteps
;
but
he
remained
so
preoccupied
with
*NL*
the
suspicion
that
he
could
turn
his
mind
to
nothing
else
.
After
waiting
*NL*
for
an
hour
,
he
returned
.
He
found
her
at
home
;
she
told
him
that
she
*NL*
had
been
in
the
house
when
he
rang
,
but
had
been
asleep
;
the
bell
had
*NL*
awakened
her
;
she
had
guessed
that
it
must
be
Swann
,
and
had
run
out
*NL*
to
meet
him
,
but
he
had
already
gone
.
She
had
,
of
course
,
heard
him
*NL*
knocking
at
the
window
.
Swann
could
at
once
detect
in
this
story
one
of
*NL*
those
fragments
of
literal
truth
which
liars
,
when
taken
by
surprise
,
*NL*
console
themselves
by
introducing
into
the
composition
of
the
falsehood
*NL*
which
they
have
to
invent
,
thinking
that
it
can
be
safely
incorporated
,
*NL*
and
will
lend
the
whole
story
an
air
of
verisimilitude
.
It
was
true
*NL*
that
,
when
Odette
had
just
done
something
which
she
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
disclose
,
she
would
take
pains
to
conceal
it
in
a
secret
place
in
her
*NL*
heart
.
But
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
man
to
*NL*
whom
she
was
obliged
to
lie
,
she
became
uneasy
,
all
her
ideas
melted
*NL*
like
wax
before
a
flame
,
her
inventive
and
her
reasoning
faculties
*NL*
were
paralysed
,
she
might
ransack
her
brain
but
would
find
only
a
void
;
*NL*
still
,
she
must
say
something
,
and
there
lay
within
her
reach
precisely
*NL*
the
fact
which
she
had
wished
to
conceal
,
which
,
being
the
truth
,
was
*NL*
the
one
thing
that
had
remained
.
She
broke
off
from
it
a
tiny
fragment
,
*NL*
of
no
importance
in
itself
,
assuring
herself
that
,
after
all
,
it
was
*NL*
the
best
thing
to
do
,
since
it
was
a
detail
of
the
truth
,
and
less
*NL*
dangerous
,
therefore
,
than
a
falsehood
.
``
At
any
rate
,
this
is
true
,
''
*NL*
she
said
to
herself
;
``
that
's
always
something
to
the
good
;
he
may
make
*NL*
inquiries
;
he
will
see
that
this
is
true
;
it
wo
n't
be
this
,
anyhow
,
that
*NL*
will
give
me
away
.
''
But
she
was
wrong
;
it
was
what
gave
her
away
;
she
*NL*
had
not
taken
into
account
that
this
fragmentary
detail
of
the
truth
*NL*
had
sharp
edges
which
could
not
:
be
made
to
fit
in
,
except
to
those
*NL*
contiguous
fragments
of
the
truth
from
which
she
had
arbitrarily
*NL*
detached
it
,
edges
which
,
whatever
the
fictitious
details
in
which
she
*NL*
might
embed
it
,
would
continue
to
shew
,
by
their
overlapping
angles
and
*NL*
by
the
gaps
which
she
had
forgotten
to
fill
,
that
its
proper
place
was
*NL*
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
admits
that
she
heard
me
ring
,
and
then
knock
,
that
she
knew
it
was
*NL*
myself
,
that
she
wanted
to
see
me
,
''
Swann
thought
to
himself
.
``
But
that
*NL*
does
n't
correspond
with
the
fact
that
she
did
not
let
me
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
,
however
,
draw
her
attention
to
this
inconsistency
,
for
he
*NL*
thought
that
,
if
left
to
herself
,
Odette
might
perhaps
produce
some
*NL*
falsehood
which
would
give
him
a
faint
indication
of
the
truth
;
she
*NL*
spoke
;
he
did
not
interrupt
her
,
he
gathered
up
,
with
an
eager
and
*NL*
sorrowful
piety
,
the
words
that
fell
from
her
lips
,
feeling
-LRB-
and
rightly
*NL*
feeling
,
since
she
was
hiding
the
truth
behind
them
as
she
spoke
-RRB-
that
,
*NL*
like
the
veil
of
a
sanctuary
,
they
kept
a
vague
imprint
,
traced
a
*NL*
faint
outline
of
that
infinitely
precious
and
,
alas
,
undiscoverable
*NL*
truth
;
--
what
she
had
been
doing
,
that
afternoon
,
at
three
o'clock
,
when
*NL*
he
had
called
,
--
a
truth
of
which
he
would
never
possess
any
more
than
*NL*
these
falsifications
,
illegible
and
divine
traces
,
a
truth
which
would
*NL*
exist
henceforward
only
in
the
secretive
memory
of
this
creature
,
who
*NL*
would
contemplate
it
in
utter
ignorance
of
its
value
,
but
would
never
*NL*
yield
it
up
to
him
.
It
was
true
that
he
had
,
now
and
then
,
a
strong
*NL*
suspicion
that
Odette
's
daily
activities
were
not
in
themselves
*NL*
passionately
interesting
,
and
that
such
relations
as
she
might
have
with
*NL*
other
men
did
not
exhale
,
naturally
,
in
a
universal
sense
,
or
for
every
*NL*
rational
being
,
a
spirit
of
morbid
gloom
capable
of
infecting
with
*NL*
fever
or
of
inciting
to
suicide
.
He
realised
,
at
such
moments
,
that
that
*NL*
interest
,
that
gloom
,
existed
in
him
only
as
a
malady
might
exist
,
and
*NL*
that
,
once
he
was
cured
of
the
malady
,
the
actions
of
Odette
,
the
kisses
*NL*
that
she
might
have
bestowed
,
would
become
once
again
as
innocuous
as
*NL*
those
of
countless
other
women
.
But
the
consciousness
that
the
painful
*NL*
curiosity
with
which
Swann
now
studied
them
had
its
origin
only
in
*NL*
himself
was
not
enough
to
make
him
decide
that
it
was
unreasonable
to
*NL*
regard
that
curiosity
as
important
,
and
to
take
every
possible
step
*NL*
to
satisfy
it
.
Swann
had
,
in
fact
,
reached
an
age
the
philosophy
of
*NL*
which
--
supported
,
in
his
case
,
by
the
current
philosophy
of
the
day
,
as
*NL*
well
as
by
that
of
the
circle
in
which
he
had
spent
most
of
his
life
,
*NL*
the
group
that
surrounded
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
in
which
one
's
*NL*
intelligence
was
understood
to
increase
with
the
strength
of
one
's
*NL*
disbelief
in
everything
,
and
nothing
real
and
incontestable
was
to
be
*NL*
discovered
,
except
the
individual
tastes
of
each
of
its
members
--
is
no
*NL*
longer
that
of
youth
,
but
a
positive
,
almost
a
medical
philosophy
,
the
*NL*
philosophy
of
men
who
,
instead
of
fixing
their
aspirations
upon
external
*NL*
objects
,
endeavour
to
separate
from
the
accumulation
of
the
years
*NL*
already
spent
a
definite
residue
of
habits
and
passions
which
they
*NL*
can
regard
as
characteristic
and
permanent
,
and
with
which
they
will
*NL*
deliberately
arrange
,
before
anything
else
,
that
the
kind
of
existence
*NL*
which
they
choose
to
adopt
shall
not
prove
inharmonious
.
Swann
deemed
*NL*
it
wise
to
make
allowance
in
his
life
for
the
suffering
which
he
derived
*NL*
from
not
knowing
what
Odette
had
done
,
just
as
he
made
allowance
for
the
*NL*
impetus
which
a
damp
climate
always
gave
to
his
eczema
;
to
anticipate
*NL*
in
his
budget
the
expenditure
of
a
considerable
sum
on
procuring
,
with
*NL*
regard
to
the
daily
occupations
of
Odette
,
information
the
lack
of
*NL*
which
would
make
him
unhappy
,
just
as
he
reserved
a
margin
for
the
*NL*
gratification
of
other
tastes
from
which
he
knew
that
pleasure
was
to
be
*NL*
expected
-LRB-
at
least
,
before
he
had
fallen
in
love
-RRB-
such
as
his
taste
for
*NL*
collecting
things
,
or
for
good
cooking
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
proposed
to
take
leave
of
Odette
,
and
to
return
home
,
she
begged
*NL*
him
to
stay
a
little
longer
,
and
even
detained
him
forcibly
,
seizing
him
*NL*
by
the
arm
as
he
was
opening
the
door
to
go
.
But
he
gave
no
thought
to
*NL*
that
,
for
,
among
the
crowd
of
gestures
and
speeches
and
other
little
*NL*
incidents
which
go
to
make
up
a
conversation
,
it
is
inevitable
that
we
*NL*
should
pass
-LRB-
without
noticing
anything
that
arouses
our
interest
-RRB-
by
*NL*
those
that
hide
a
truth
for
which
our
suspicions
are
blindly
searching
,
*NL*
whereas
we
stop
to
examine
others
beneath
which
nothing
lies
concealed
.
*NL*
She
kept
on
saying
:
``
What
a
dreadful
pity
;
you
never
by
any
chance
come
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
,
and
the
one
time
you
do
come
then
I
miss
you
.
''
He
knew
*NL*
very
well
that
she
was
not
sufficiently
in
love
with
him
to
be
so
*NL*
keenly
distressed
merely
at
having
missed
his
visit
,
but
as
she
was
a
*NL*
good-natured
woman
,
anxious
to
give
him
pleasure
,
and
often
sorry
when
*NL*
she
had
done
anything
that
annoyed
him
,
he
found
it
quite
natural
that
*NL*
she
should
be
sorry
,
on
this
occasion
,
that
she
had
deprived
him
of
that
*NL*
pleasure
of
spending
an
hour
in
her
company
,
which
was
so
very
great
a
*NL*
pleasure
,
if
not
to
herself
,
at
any
rate
to
him
.
All
the
same
,
it
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
so
little
importance
that
her
air
of
unrelieved
sorrow
began
*NL*
at
length
to
bewilder
him
.
She
reminded
him
,
even
more
than
was
*NL*
usual
,
of
the
faces
of
some
of
the
women
created
by
the
painter
of
*NL*
the
Primavera
.
'
She
had
,
at
that
moment
,
their
downcast
,
heartbroken
*NL*
expression
,
which
seems
ready
to
succumb
beneath
the
burden
of
a
grief
*NL*
too
heavy
to
be
borne
,
when
they
are
merely
allowing
the
Infant
Jesus
to
*NL*
play
with
a
pomegranate
,
or
watching
Moses
pour
water
into
a
trough
.
He
*NL*
had
seen
the
same
sorrow
once
before
on
her
face
,
but
when
,
he
could
*NL*
no
longer
say
.
Then
,
suddenly
,
he
remembered
it
;
it
was
when
Odette
had
*NL*
lied
,
in
apologising
to
Mme.
Verdurin
on
the
evening
after
the
dinner
*NL*
from
which
she
had
stayed
away
on
a
pretext
of
illness
,
but
really
so
*NL*
that
she
might
be
alone
with
Swann
.
Surely
,
even
had
she
been
the
most
*NL*
scrupulous
of
women
,
she
could
hardly
have
felt
remorse
for
so
innocent
*NL*
a
lie
.
But
the
lies
which
Odette
ordinarily
told
were
less
innocent
,
and
*NL*
served
to
prevent
discoveries
which
might
have
involved
her
in
the
most
*NL*
terrible
difficulties
with
one
or
another
of
her
friends
.
And
so
,
when
*NL*
she
lied
,
smitten
with
fear
,
feeling
herself
to
be
but
feebly
armed
for
*NL*
her
defence
,
unconfident
of
success
,
she
was
inclined
to
weep
from
sheer
*NL*
exhaustion
,
as
children
weep
sometimes
when
they
have
not
slept
.
She
*NL*
knew
,
also
,
that
her
lie
,
as
a
rule
,
was
doing
a
serious
injury
to
the
*NL*
man
to
whom
she
was
telling
it
,
and
that
she
might
find
herself
at
*NL*
his
mercy
if
she
told
it
badly
.
Therefore
she
felt
at
once
humble
and
*NL*
culpable
in
his
presence
.
And
when
she
had
to
tell
an
insignificant
,
*NL*
social
lie
its
hazardous
associations
,
and
the
memories
which
it
*NL*
recalled
,
would
leave
her
weak
with
a
sense
of
exhaustion
and
penitent
*NL*
with
a
consciousness
of
wrongdoing
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
depressing
lie
was
she
now
concocting
for
Swann
's
benefit
,
to
give
*NL*
her
that
pained
expression
,
that
plaintive
voice
,
which
seemed
to
falter
*NL*
beneath
the
effort
that
she
was
forcing
herself
to
make
,
and
to
plead
*NL*
for
pardon
?
He
had
an
idea
that
it
was
not
merely
the
truth
about
what
*NL*
had
occurred
that
afternoon
that
she
was
endeavouring
to
hide
from
him
,
*NL*
but
something
more
immediate
,
something
,
possibly
,
which
had
not
yet
*NL*
happened
,
but
might
happen
now
at
any
time
,
and
,
when
it
did
,
would
*NL*
throw
a
light
upon
that
earlier
event
.
At
that
moment
,
he
heard
the
*NL*
front-door
bell
ring
.
Odette
never
stopped
speaking
,
but
her
words
*NL*
dwindled
into
an
inarticulate
moan
.
Her
regret
at
not
having
seen
Swann
*NL*
that
afternoon
,
at
not
having
opened
the
door
to
him
,
had
melted
into
a
*NL*
universal
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hear
the
gate
being
closed
,
and
the
sound
of
a
carriage
,
as
*NL*
though
some
one
were
going
away
--
probably
the
person
whom
Swann
must
on
*NL*
no
account
meet
--
after
being
told
that
Odette
was
not
at
home
.
And
then
,
*NL*
when
he
reflected
that
,
merely
by
coming
at
an
hour
when
he
was
not
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
coming
,
he
had
managed
to
disturb
so
many
arrangements
of
*NL*
which
she
did
not
wish
him
to
know
,
he
had
a
feeling
of
discouragement
*NL*
that
amounted
,
almost
,
to
distress
.
But
since
he
was
in
love
with
*NL*
Odette
,
since
he
was
in
the
habit
of
turning
all
his
thoughts
towards
*NL*
her
,
the
pity
with
which
he
might
have
been
inspired
for
himself
he
felt
*NL*
for
her
only
,
and
murmured
:
``
Poor
darling
!
''
When
finally
he
left
her
,
*NL*
she
took
up
several
letters
which
were
lying
on
the
table
,
and
asked
him
*NL*
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
post
them
for
her
.
He
walked
along
to
the
*NL*
post-office
,
took
the
letters
from
his
pocket
,
and
,
before
dropping
each
*NL*
of
them
into
the
box
,
scanned
its
address
.
They
were
all
to
tradesmen
,
*NL*
except
the
last
,
which
was
to
Forcheville
.
He
kept
it
in
his
hand
.
``
If
*NL*
I
saw
what
was
in
this
,
''
he
argued
,
``
I
should
know
what
she
calls
him
,
*NL*
what
she
says
to
him
,
whether
there
really
is
anything
between
them
.
*NL*
Perhaps
,
if
I
do
n't
look
inside
,
I
shall
be
lacking
in
delicacy
towards
*NL*
Odette
,
since
in
this
way
alone
I
can
rid
myself
of
a
suspicion
which
*NL*
is
,
perhaps
,
a
calumny
on
her
,
which
must
,
in
any
case
,
cause
her
*NL*
suffering
,
and
which
can
never
possibly
be
set
at
rest
,
once
the
letter
*NL*
is
posted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
post-office
and
went
home
,
but
he
had
kept
the
last
letter
*NL*
in
his
pocket
.
He
lighted
a
candle
,
and
held
up
close
to
its
flame
the
*NL*
envelope
which
he
had
not
dared
to
open
.
At
first
he
could
distinguish
*NL*
nothing
,
but
the
envelope
was
thin
,
and
by
pressing
it
down
on
to
the
*NL*
stiff
card
which
it
enclosed
he
was
able
,
through
the
transparent
paper
,
*NL*
to
read
the
concluding
words
.
They
were
a
coldly
formal
signature
.
If
,
*NL*
instead
of
its
being
himself
who
was
looking
at
a
letter
addressed
to
*NL*
Forcheville
,
it
had
been
Forcheville
who
had
read
a
letter
addressed
*NL*
to
Swann
,
he
might
have
found
words
in
it
of
another
,
a
far
more
tender
*NL*
kind
!
He
took
a
firm
hold
of
the
card
,
which
was
sliding
to
and
fro
,
the
*NL*
envelope
being
too
large
for
it
and
then
,
by
moving
it
with
his
finger
*NL*
and
thumb
,
brought
one
line
after
another
beneath
the
part
of
the
*NL*
envelope
where
the
paper
was
not
doubled
,
through
which
alone
it
was
*NL*
possible
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
these
manoeuvres
he
could
not
make
it
out
clearly
.
Not
*NL*
that
it
mattered
,
for
he
had
seen
enough
to
assure
himself
that
the
*NL*
letter
was
about
some
trifling
incident
of
no
importance
,
and
had
*NL*
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
love
;
it
was
something
to
do
with
Odette
's
*NL*
uncle
.
Swann
had
read
quite
plainly
at
the
beginning
of
the
line
``
I
*NL*
was
right
,
''
but
did
not
understand
what
Odette
had
been
right
in
doing
,
*NL*
until
suddenly
a
word
which
he
had
not
been
able
,
at
first
,
to
decipher
,
*NL*
came
to
light
and
made
the
whole
sentence
intelligible
:
``
I
was
right
to
*NL*
open
the
door
;
it
was
my
uncle
.
''
To
open
the
door
!
Then
Forcheville
had
*NL*
been
there
when
Swann
rang
the
bell
,
and
she
had
sent
him
away
;
hence
*NL*
the
sound
that
Swann
had
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
he
read
the
whole
letter
;
at
the
end
she
apologised
for
*NL*
having
treated
Forcheville
with
so
little
ceremony
,
and
reminded
him
*NL*
that
he
had
left
his
cigarette-case
at
her
house
,
precisely
what
she
*NL*
had
written
to
Swann
after
one
of
his
first
visits
.
But
to
Swann
she
had
*NL*
added
:
``
Why
did
you
not
forget
your
heart
also
?
I
should
never
have
let
*NL*
you
have
that
back
.
''
To
Forcheville
nothing
of
that
sort
;
no
allusion
*NL*
that
could
suggest
any
intrigue
between
them
.
And
,
really
,
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
admit
that
in
all
this
business
Forcheville
had
been
worse
*NL*
treated
than
himself
,
since
Odette
was
writing
to
him
to
make
him
*NL*
believe
that
her
visitor
had
been
an
uncle
.
From
which
it
followed
that
*NL*
he
,
Swann
,
was
the
man
to
whom
she
attached
importance
,
and
for
whose
*NL*
sake
she
had
sent
the
other
away
.
And
yet
,
if
there
had
been
nothing
*NL*
between
Odette
and
Forcheville
,
why
not
have
opened
the
door
at
once
,
*NL*
why
have
said
,
``
I
was
right
to
open
the
door
;
it
was
my
uncle
.
''
Right
?
*NL*
if
she
was
doing
nothing
wrong
at
that
moment
how
could
Forcheville
*NL*
possibly
have
accounted
for
her
not
opening
the
door
?
For
a
time
Swann
*NL*
stood
still
there
,
heartbroken
,
bewildered
,
and
yet
happy
;
gazing
at
*NL*
this
envelope
which
Odette
had
handed
to
him
without
a
scruple
,
so
*NL*
absolute
was
her
trust
in
his
honour
;
through
its
transparent
window
*NL*
there
had
been
disclosed
to
him
,
with
the
secret
history
of
an
incident
*NL*
which
he
had
despaired
of
ever
being
able
to
learn
,
a
fragment
of
the
*NL*
life
of
Odette
,
seen
as
through
a
narrow
,
luminous
incision
,
cut
into
*NL*
its
surface
without
her
knowledge
.
Then
his
jealousy
rejoiced
at
the
*NL*
discovery
,
as
though
that
jealousy
had
had
an
independent
existence
,
*NL*
fiercely
egotistical
,
gluttonous
of
every
thing
that
would
feed
its
*NL*
vitality
,
even
at
the
expense
of
Swann
himself
.
Now
it
had
food
in
*NL*
store
,
and
Swann
could
begin
to
grow
uneasy
afresh
every
evening
,
over
*NL*
the
visits
that
Odette
had
received
about
five
o'clock
,
and
could
*NL*
seek
to
discover
where
Forcheville
had
been
at
that
hour
.
For
Swann
's
*NL*
affection
for
Odette
still
preserved
the
form
which
had
been
imposed
on
*NL*
it
,
from
the
beginning
,
by
his
ignorance
of
the
occupations
in
which
she
*NL*
passed
her
days
,
as
well
as
by
the
mental
lethargy
which
prevented
him
*NL*
from
supplementing
that
ignorance
by
imagination
.
He
was
not
jealous
,
at
*NL*
first
,
of
the
whole
of
Odette
's
life
,
but
of
those
moments
only
in
which
*NL*
an
incident
,
which
he
had
perhaps
misinterpreted
,
had
led
him
to
suppose
*NL*
that
Odette
might
have
played
him
false
.
His
jealousy
,
like
an
octopus
*NL*
which
throws
out
a
first
,
then
a
second
,
and
finally
a
third
tentacle
,
*NL*
fastened
itself
irremovably
first
to
that
moment
,
five
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
,
then
to
another
,
then
to
another
again
.
But
Swann
was
*NL*
incapable
of
inventing
his
sufferings
.
They
were
only
the
memory
,
the
*NL*
perpetuation
of
a
suffering
that
had
come
to
him
from
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
without
,
however
,
everything
brought
him
fresh
suffering
.
He
*NL*
decided
to
separate
Odette
from
Forcheville
,
by
taking
her
away
for
a
*NL*
few
days
to
the
south
.
But
he
imagined
that
she
was
coveted
by
every
*NL*
male
person
in
the
hotel
,
and
that
she
coveted
them
in
return
.
And
so
*NL*
he
,
who
,
in
old
days
,
when
he
travelled
,
used
always
to
seek
out
new
*NL*
people
and
crowded
places
,
might
now
be
seen
fleeing
savagely
from
human
*NL*
society
as
if
it
had
cruelly
injured
him
.
And
how
could
he
not
have
*NL*
turned
misanthrope
,
when
in
every
man
he
saw
a
potential
lover
for
*NL*
Odette
?
Thus
his
jealousy
did
even
more
than
the
happy
,
passionate
*NL*
desire
which
he
had
originally
felt
for
Odette
had
done
to
alter
Swann
's
*NL*
character
,
completely
changing
,
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
,
even
the
*NL*
outward
signs
by
which
that
character
had
been
intelligible
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
month
after
the
evening
on
which
he
had
intercepted
and
read
Odette
's
*NL*
letter
to
Forcheville
,
Swann
went
to
a
dinner
which
the
Verdurins
were
*NL*
giving
in
the
Bois
.
As
the
party
was
breaking
up
he
noticed
a
series
of
*NL*
whispered
discussions
between
Mme.
Verdurin
and
several
of
her
guests
,
*NL*
and
thought
that
he
heard
the
pianist
being
reminded
to
come
next
day
to
*NL*
a
party
at
Chatou
;
now
he
,
Swann
,
had
not
been
invited
to
any
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Verdurins
had
spoken
only
in
whispers
,
and
in
vague
terms
,
but
the
*NL*
painter
,
perhaps
without
thinking
,
shouted
out
:
``
There
must
be
no
lights
*NL*
of
any
sort
,
and
he
must
play
the
Moonlight
Sonata
in
the
dark
,
for
us
*NL*
to
see
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
Verdurin
,
seeing
that
Swann
was
within
earshot
,
assumed
that
*NL*
expression
in
which
the
two-fold
desire
to
make
the
speaker
be
quiet
and
*NL*
to
preserve
,
oneself
,
an
appearance
of
guilelessness
in
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
listener
,
is
neutralised
in
an
intense
vacuity
;
in
which
the
unflinching
*NL*
signs
of
intelligent
complicity
are
overlaid
by
the
smiles
of
innocence
,
*NL*
an
expression
invariably
adopted
by
anyone
who
has
noticed
a
blunder
,
*NL*
the
enormity
of
which
is
thereby
at
once
revealed
if
not
to
those
who
*NL*
have
made
it
,
at
any
rate
to
him
in
whose
hearing
it
ought
not
to
have
*NL*
been
made
.
Odette
seemed
suddenly
to
be
in
despair
,
as
though
she
had
*NL*
decided
not
to
struggle
any
longer
against
the
crushing
difficulties
of
*NL*
life
,
and
Swann
was
anxiously
counting
the
minutes
that
still
separated
*NL*
him
from
the
point
at
which
,
after
leaving
the
restaurant
,
while
he
*NL*
drove
her
home
,
he
would
be
able
to
ask
for
an
explanation
,
to
make
her
*NL*
promise
,
either
that
she
would
not
go
to
Chatou
next
day
,
or
that
she
*NL*
would
procure
an
invitation
for
him
also
,
and
to
lull
to
rest
in
her
*NL*
arms
the
anguish
that
still
tormented
him
.
At
last
the
carriages
were
*NL*
ordered
.
Mme.
Verdurin
said
to
Swann
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
then
.
We
shall
see
you
soon
,
I
hope
,
''
trying
,
by
the
*NL*
friendliness
of
her
manner
and
the
constraint
of
her
smile
,
to
prevent
*NL*
him
from
noticing
that
she
was
not
saying
,
as
she
would
always
have
*NL*
until
then
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
then
,
at
Chatou
,
and
at
my
house
the
day
after
.
''
M.
and
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
made
Forcheville
get
into
their
carriage
;
Swann
's
was
drawn
up
*NL*
behind
it
,
and
he
waited
for
theirs
to
start
before
helping
Odette
into
*NL*
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Odette
,
we
'll
take
you
,
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
,
``
we
've
kept
a
little
*NL*
corner
specially
for
you
,
beside
M.
de
Forcheville
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mme.
Verdurin
,
''
said
Odette
meekly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
I
thought
I
was
to
take
you
home
,
''
cried
Swann
,
flinging
*NL*
discretion
to
the
winds
,
for
the
carriage-door
hung
open
,
time
was
*NL*
precious
,
and
he
could
not
,
in
his
present
state
,
go
home
without
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mme.
Verdurin
has
asked
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
all
right
,
you
can
quite
well
go
home
alone
;
we
've
left
you
like
*NL*
this
dozens
of
times
,
''
said
Mme.
Verdurin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
had
something
important
to
tell
Mme.
de
Crécy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
you
can
write
it
to
her
instead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
,
''
said
Odette
,
holding
out
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
hard
to
smile
,
but
could
only
succeed
in
looking
utterly
*NL*
dejected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
think
of
the
airs
that
Swann
is
pleased
to
put
on
with
*NL*
us
?
''
Mme.
Verdurin
asked
her
husband
when
they
had
reached
home
.
``
I
was
*NL*
afraid
he
was
going
to
eat
me
,
simply
because
we
offered
to
take
Odette
*NL*
back
.
It
really
is
too
bad
,
that
sort
of
thing
.
Why
does
n't
he
say
,
*NL*
straight
out
,
that
we
keep
a
disorderly
house
?
I
ca
n't
conceive
how
*NL*
Odette
can
stand
such
manners
.
He
positively
seems
to
be
saying
,
all
the
*NL*
time
,
`
You
belong
to
me
!
'
I
shall
tell
Odette
exactly
what
I
think
about
*NL*
it
all
,
and
I
hope
she
will
have
the
sense
to
understand
me
.
''
A
moment
*NL*
later
she
added
,
inarticulate
with
rage
:
``
No
,
but
,
do
n't
you
see
,
the
*NL*
filthy
creature
...
''
using
unconsciously
,
and
perhaps
in
satisfaction
of
*NL*
the
same
obscure
need
to
justify
herself
--
like
Françoise
at
Combray
when
*NL*
the
chicken
refused
to
die
--
the
very
words
which
the
last
convulsions
of
*NL*
an
inoffensive
animal
in
its
death
agony
wring
from
the
peasant
who
is
*NL*
engaged
in
taking
its
life
.
And
when
Mme.
Verdurin
's
carriage
had
moved
*NL*
on
,
and
Swann
's
took
its
place
,
his
coachman
,
catching
sight
of
his
*NL*
face
,
asked
whether
he
was
unwell
,
or
had
heard
bad
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
sent
him
away
;
he
preferred
to
walk
,
and
it
was
on
foot
,
through
*NL*
the
Bois
,
that
he
came
home
.
He
talked
to
himself
,
aloud
,
and
in
*NL*
the
same
slightly
affected
tone
which
he
had
been
used
to
adopt
*NL*
when
describing
the
charms
of
the
`
little
nucleus
'
and
extolling
the
*NL*
magnanimity
of
the
Verdurins
.
But
just
as
the
conversation
,
the
smiles
,
*NL*
the
kisses
of
Odette
became
as
odious
to
him
as
he
had
once
found
*NL*
them
charming
,
if
they
were
diverted
to
others
than
himself
,
so
the
*NL*
Verdurins
'
drawing-room
,
which
,
not
an
hour
before
,
had
still
seemed
*NL*
to
him
amusing
,
inspired
with
a
genuine
feeling
for
art
and
even
with
*NL*
a
sort
of
moral
aristocracy
,
now
that
it
was
another
than
himself
whom
*NL*
Odette
was
going
to
meet
there
,
to
love
there
without
restraint
,
laid
*NL*
bare
to
him
all
its
absurdities
,
its
stupidity
,
its
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
a
fanciful
picture
,
at
which
he
shuddered
in
disgust
,
of
the
*NL*
party
next
evening
at
Chatou
.
``
Imagine
going
to
Chatou
,
of
all
places
!
*NL*
Like
a
lot
of
drapers
after
closing
time
!
Upon
my
word
,
these
people
are
*NL*
sublime
in
their
smugness
;
they
ca
n't
really
exist
;
they
must
all
have
*NL*
come
out
of
one
of
Labiche
's
plays
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Cottards
would
be
there
;
possibly
Brichot
.
``
Could
anything
be
more
*NL*
grotesque
than
the
lives
of
these
little
creatures
,
hanging
on
to
one
*NL*
another
like
that
.
They
'd
imagine
they
were
utterly
lost
,
upon
my
soul
*NL*
they
would
,
if
they
did
n't
all
meet
again
to-morrow
at
_
Chatou
_
!
''
*NL*
Alas
!
there
would
be
the
painter
there
also
,
the
painter
who
enjoyed
*NL*
match-making
,
who
would
invite
Forcheville
to
come
with
Odette
to
his
*NL*
studio
.
He
could
see
Odette
,
in
a
dress
far
too
smart
for
the
country
,
*NL*
``
for
she
is
so
vulgar
in
that
way
,
and
,
poor
little
thing
,
she
is
such
a
*NL*
fool
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hear
the
jokes
that
Mme.
Verdurin
would
make
after
dinner
,
*NL*
jokes
which
,
whoever
the
`
bore
'
might
be
at
whom
they
were
aimed
,
*NL*
had
always
amused
him
because
he
could
watch
Odette
laughing
at
them
,
*NL*
laughing
with
him
,
her
laughter
almost
a
part
of
his
.
Now
he
felt
that
*NL*
it
was
possibly
at
him
that
they
would
make
Odette
laugh
.
``
What
a
fetid
*NL*
form
of
humour
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
twisting
his
mouth
into
an
expression
of
*NL*
disgust
so
violent
that
he
could
feel
the
muscles
of
his
throat
stiffen
*NL*
against
his
collar
.
``
How
,
in
God
's
name
,
can
a
creature
made
in
His
*NL*
image
find
anything
to
laugh
at
in
those
nauseating
witticisms
?
The
*NL*
least
sensitive
nose
must
be
driven
away
in
horror
from
such
stale
*NL*
exhalations
.
It
is
really
impossible
to
believe
that
any
human
being
is
*NL*
incapable
of
understanding
that
,
in
allowing
herself
merely
to
smile
at
*NL*
the
expense
of
a
fellow-creature
who
has
loyally
held
out
his
hand
*NL*
to
her
,
she
is
casting
herself
into
a
mire
from
which
it
will
be
*NL*
impossible
,
with
the
best
will
in
the
world
,
ever
to
rescue
her
.
I
dwell
*NL*
so
many
miles
above
the
puddles
in
which
these
filthy
little
vermin
*NL*
sprawl
and
crawl
and
bawl
their
cheap
obscenities
,
that
I
can
not
*NL*
possibly
be
spattered
by
the
witticisms
of
a
Verdurin
!
''
he
cried
,
*NL*
tossing
up
his
head
and
arrogantly
straightening
his
body
.
``
God
knows
*NL*
that
I
have
honestly
attempted
to
pull
Odette
out
of
that
sewer
,
and
to
*NL*
teach
her
to
breathe
a
nobler
and
a
purer
air
.
But
human
patience
has
*NL*
its
limits
,
and
mine
is
at
an
end
,
''
he
concluded
,
as
though
this
sacred
*NL*
mission
to
tear
Odette
away
from
an
atmosphere
of
sarcasms
dated
from
*NL*
longer
than
a
few
minutes
ago
,
as
though
he
had
not
undertaken
it
only
*NL*
since
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
those
sarcasms
might
,
perchance
,
be
*NL*
directed
at
himself
,
and
might
have
the
effect
of
detaching
Odette
from
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
see
the
pianist
sitting
down
to
play
the
Moonlight
Sonata
,
and
*NL*
the
grimaces
of
Mme.
Verdurin
,
in
terrified
anticipation
of
the
wrecking
*NL*
of
her
nerves
by
Beethoven
's
music
.
``
Idiot
,
liar
!
''
he
shouted
,
``
and
a
*NL*
creature
like
that
imagines
that
she
's
fond
of
_
Art
_
!
''
She
would
say
to
*NL*
Odette
,
after
deftly
insinuating
a
few
words
of
praise
for
Forcheville
,
*NL*
as
she
had
so
often
done
for
himself
:
``
You
can
make
room
for
M.
de
*NL*
Forcheville
there
,
ca
n't
you
,
Odette
?
''
...
'
``
In
the
dark
!
'
Codfish
!
*NL*
Pander
!
''
...
`
Pander
'
was
the
name
he
applied
also
to
the
music
which
*NL*
would
invite
them
to
sit
in
silence
,
to
dream
together
,
to
gaze
in
each
*NL*
other
's
eyes
,
to
feel
for
each
other
's
hands
.
He
felt
that
there
was
*NL*
much
to
be
said
,
after
all
,
for
a
sternly
censorous
attitude
towards
*NL*
the
arts
,
such
as
Plato
adopted
,
and
Bossuet
,
and
the
old
school
of
*NL*
education
in
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
the
life
which
they
led
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
which
he
had
so
*NL*
often
described
as
`
genuine
,
'
seemed
to
him
now
the
worst
possible
form
*NL*
of
life
,
and
their
`
little
nucleus
'
the
most
degraded
class
of
society
.
*NL*
``
It
really
is
,
''
he
repeated
,
``
beneath
the
lowest
rung
of
the
social
*NL*
ladder
,
the
nethermost
circle
of
Dante
.
Beyond
a
doubt
,
the
august
words
*NL*
of
the
Florentine
refer
to
the
Verdurins
!
When
one
comes
to
think
of
it

surely

,
though
one
may
find
fault
with
them

then

after
all
they
are
a
very
different

a
profound
sagacity
in
refusing
to
know
*NL*
them
,
or
even
to
dirty
the
tips
of
their
fingers
with
them
.
What
a
sound
*NL*
intuition
there
is
in
that

_
Noli

motto
of
the
Faubourg

*NL*
He
had
long
since
emerged
from
the
paths
and
avenues
of
the
Bois
,
he
had
*NL*
almost
reached
his
own
house
,
and
still
,
for
he
had
not
yet
thrown
off
*NL*
the
intoxication
of
grief
,
or
his
whim
of
insincerity
,
but
was
ever
more
*NL*
and
more
exhilarated
by
the
false
intonation
,
the
artificial
sonority
*NL*
of
his
own
voice
,
he
continued
to
perorate
aloud
in
the
silence
of
the
*NL*
night
:
``
People
`

have
their
failings
,
as
no
one
knows
better
*NL*
than
I
;
but
,
after
all

they
are
people
to
whom
some
things

at

,
*NL*
are
impossible

So-and-so
''
-LRB-
a
fashionable
woman
whom
he
had
known
-RRB-
*NL*
``
was
far
from
being
perfect

but
,
after
all
,
one
did
find
in
her
a
*NL*
fundamental
delicacy

a
loyalty
in
her
conduct
which
made
her
,
whatever
*NL*
happened

incapable
of
a

which
fixes
a
vast
gulf
between
her
and
*NL*
an
old
hag
like
Verdurin

Verdurin
!
What
a

!
Oh
,
there
's
something
*NL*
complete
about
them

something
almost
fine
in
their
trueness
to
type

*NL*
they
're
the
most
perfect
specimens
of
their
disgusting
class

Thank
God

*NL*
it
was
high
time
that
I
stopped
condescending
to
promiscuous
intercourse
*NL*
with
such
infamy
,
such
dung

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
just
as
the
virtues
which
he
had
still
attributed
,
an
hour
or
so
*NL*
earlier
,
to
the
Verdurins
,
would
not
have
sufficed
,
even
although
the
*NL*
Verdurins
had
actually
possessed
them
,
if
they
had
not
also
favoured
*NL*
and
protected
his
love
,
to
excite
Swann
to
that
state
of
intoxication
*NL*
in
which
he
waxed
tender
over
their
magnanimity
,
an
intoxication
which
,
*NL*
even
when
disseminated
through
the
medium
of
other
persons
,
could
*NL*
have
come
to
him
from
Odette
alone
;
--
so
the
immorality
-LRB-
had
it
really
*NL*
existed
-RRB-
which
he
now
found
in
the
Verdurins
would
have
been
powerless
,
*NL*
if
they
had
not
invited
Odette
with
Forcheville
and
without
him
,
to
*NL*
unstop
the
vials
of
his
wrath
and
to
make
him
scarify
their
`
infamy
.
'
*NL*
Doubtless
Swann
's
voice
shewed
a
finer
perspicacity
than
his
own
when
it
*NL*
refused
to
utter
those
words
full
of
disgust
at
the
Verdurins
and
their
*NL*
circle
,
and
of
joy
at
his
having
shaken
himself
free
of
it
,
save
in
an
*NL*
artificial
and
rhetorical
tone
,
and
as
though
his
words
had
been
chosen
*NL*
rather
to
appease
his
anger
than
to
express
his
thoughts
.
The
latter
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
while
he
abandoned
himself
to
invective
,
were
probably
,
though
he
*NL*
did
not
know
it
,
occupied
with
a
wholly
different
matter
,
for
once
he
*NL*
had
reached
his
house
,
no
sooner
had
he
closed
the
front-door
behind
him
*NL*
than
he
suddenly
struck
his
forehead
,
and
,
making
his
servant
open
the
*NL*
door
again
,
dashed
out
into
the
street
shouting
,
in
a
voice
which
,
*NL*
this
time
,
was
quite
natural
;
``
I
believe
I
have
found
a
way
of
getting
*NL*
invited
to
the
dinner
at
Chatou
to-morrow
!
''
But
it
must
have
been
a
*NL*
bad
way
,
for
M.
Swann
was
not
invited
;
Dr.
Cottard
,
who
,
having
been
*NL*
summoned
to
attend
a
serious
case
in
the
country
,
had
not
seen
the
*NL*
Verdurins
for
some
days
,
and
had
been
prevented
from
appearing
at
*NL*
Chatou
,
said
,
on
the
evening
after
this
dinner
,
as
he
sat
down
to
table
*NL*
at
their
house
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
are
n't
we
going
to
see
M.
Swann
this
evening
?
He
is
quite
what
you
*NL*
might
call
a
personal
friend
...
''
``
I
sincerely
trust
that
we
sha
'n'
t
!
''
*NL*
cried
Mme.
Verdurin
.
``
Heaven
preserve
us
from
him
;
he
's
too
deadly
for
*NL*
words
,
a
stupid
,
ill-bred
boor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
these
words
Cottard
exhibited
an
intense
astonishment
blended
*NL*
with
entire
submission
,
as
though
in
the
face
of
a
scientific
truth
*NL*
which
contradicted
everything
that
he
had
previously
believed
,
but
was
*NL*
supported
by
an
irresistible
weight
of
evidence
;
with
timorous
*NL*
emotion
he
bowed
his
head
over
his
plate
,
and
merely
replied
:
*NL*
``
Oh
--
oh
--
oh
--
oh
--
oh
!
''
traversing
,
in
an
orderly
retirement
of
his
*NL*
forces
,
into
the
depths
of
his
being
,
along
a
descending
scale
,
the
*NL*
whole
compass
of
his
voice
.
After
which
there
was
no
more
talk
of
Swann
*NL*
at
the
Verdurins
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
that
drawing-room
which
had
brought
Swann
and
Odette
together
*NL*
became
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
their
meeting
.
She
no
longer
said
to
*NL*
him
,
as
she
had
said
in
the
early
days
of
their
love
:
``
We
shall
meet
,
*NL*
anyhow
,
to-morrow
evening
;
there
's
a
supper-party
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
''
*NL*
but
``
We
sha
'n'
t
be
able
to
meet
to-morrow
evening
;
there
's
a
*NL*
supper-party
at
the
Verdurins
'
.
''
Or
else
the
Verdurins
were
taking
her
*NL*
to
the
Opéra-Comique
,
to
see
_
Une
Nuit
de
Cléopâtre
_
,
and
Swann
could
*NL*
read
in
her
eyes
that
terror
lest
he
should
ask
her
not
to
go
,
which
,
*NL*
but
a
little
time
before
,
he
could
not
have
refrained
from
greeting
*NL*
with
a
kiss
as
it
flitted
across
the
face
of
his
mistress
,
but
which
now
*NL*
exasperated
him
.
``
Yet
I
'm
not
really
angry
,
''
he
assured
himself
,
``
when
I
*NL*
see
how
she
longs
to
run
away
and
scratch
from
maggots
in
that
*NL*
dunghill
of
cacophony
.
I
'm
disappointed
;
not
for
myself
,
but
for
her
;
*NL*
disappointed
to
find
that
,
after
living
for
more
than
six
months
in
*NL*
daily
contact
with
myself
,
she
has
not
been
capable
of
improving
her
*NL*
mind
even
to
the
point
of
spontaneously
eradicating
from
it
a
taste
for
*NL*
Victor
Massé
!
More
than
that
,
to
find
that
she
has
not
arrived
at
the
*NL*
stage
of
understanding
that
there
are
evenings
on
which
anyone
with
*NL*
the
least
shade
of
refinement
of
feeling
should
be
willing
to
forego
*NL*
an
amusement
when
she
is
asked
to
do
so
.
She
ought
to
have
the
sense
to
*NL*
say
:
'
I
shall
not
go
,
'
if
it
were
only
from
policy
,
since
it
is
by
what
*NL*
she
answers
now
that
the
quality
of
her
soul
will
be
determined
once
and
*NL*
for
all
.
''
And
having
persuaded
himself
that
it
was
solely
,
after
all
,
*NL*
in
order
that
he
might
arrive
at
a
favourable
estimate
of
Odette
's
*NL*
spiritual
worth
that
he
wished
her
to
stay
at
home
with
him
that
evening
*NL*
instead
of
going
to
the
Opéra-Comique
,
he
adopted
the
same
line
of
*NL*
reasoning
with
her
,
with
the
same
degree
of
insincerity
as
he
had
*NL*
used
with
himself
,
or
even
with
a
degree
more
,
for
in
her
case
he
was
*NL*
yielding
also
to
the
desire
to
capture
her
by
her
own
self-esteem
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
swear
to
you
,
''
he
told
her
,
shortly
before
she
was
to
leave
for
the
*NL*
theatre
,
``
that
,
in
asking
you
not
to
go
,
I
should
hope
,
were
I
a
*NL*
selfish
man
,
for
nothing
so
much
as
that
you
should
refuse
,
for
I
have
*NL*
a
thousand
other
things
to
do
this
evening
,
and
I
shall
feel
that
I
have
*NL*
been
tricked
and
trapped
myself
,
and
shall
be
thoroughly
annoyed
,
if
,
*NL*
after
all
,
you
tell
me
that
you
are
not
going
.
But
my
occupations
,
my
*NL*
pleasures
are
not
everything
;
I
must
think
of
you
also
.
A
day
may
come
*NL*
when
,
seeing
me
irrevocably
sundered
from
you
,
you
will
be
entitled
to
*NL*
reproach
me
with
not
having
warned
you
at
the
decisive
hour
in
which
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
was
going
to
pass
judgment
on
you
,
one
of
those
stern
*NL*
judgments
which
love
can
not
long
resist
.
You
see
,
your
_
Nuit
de
*NL*
Cléopâtre
_
-LRB-
what
a
title
!
-RRB-
has
no
bearing
on
the
point
.
What
I
must
know
*NL*
is
whether
you
are
indeed
one
of
those
creatures
in
the
lowest
grade
of
*NL*
mentality
and
even
of
charm
,
one
of
those
contemptible
creatures
who
are
*NL*
incapable
of
foregoing
a
pleasure
.
For
if
you
are
such
,
how
could
anyone
*NL*
love
you
,
for
you
are
not
even
a
person
,
a
definite
,
imperfect
,
but
at
*NL*
least
perceptible
entity
.
You
are
a
formless
water
that
will
trickle
*NL*
down
any
slope
that
it
may
come
upon
,
a
fish
devoid
of
memory
,
incapable
*NL*
of
thought
,
which
all
its
life
long
in
its
aquarium
will
continue
to
*NL*
dash
itself
,
a
hundred
times
a
day
,
against
a
wall
of
glass
,
always
*NL*
mistaking
it
for
water
.
Do
you
realise
that
your
answer
will
have
the
*NL*
effect
--
I
do
not
say
of
making
me
cease
from
that
moment
to
love
you
,
*NL*
that
goes
without
saying
,
but
of
making
you
less
attractive
to
my
*NL*
eyes
when
I
realise
that
you
are
not
a
person
,
that
you
are
beneath
*NL*
everything
in
the
world
and
have
not
the
intelligence
to
raise
yourself
*NL*
one
inch
higher
?
Obviously
,
I
should
have
preferred
to
ask
you
,
as
*NL*
though
it
had
been
a
matter
of
little
or
no
importance
,
to
give
up
your
*NL*
_
Nuit
de
Cléopâtre
_
-LRB-
since
you
compel
me
to
sully
my
lips
with
so
abject
*NL*
a
name
-RRB-
,
in
the
hope
that
you
would
go
to
it
none
the
less
.
But
,
since
*NL*
I
had
resolved
to
weigh
you
in
the
balance
,
to
make
so
grave
an
issue
*NL*
depend
upon
your
answer
,
I
considered
it
more
honourable
to
give
you
due
*NL*
warning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Odette
had
shewn
signs
of
increasing
emotion
and
uncertainty
.
*NL*
Although
the
meaning
of
his
tirade
was
beyond
her
,
she
grasped
that
it
*NL*
was
to
be
included
among
the
scenes
of
reproach
or
supplication
,
scenes
*NL*
which
her
familiarity
with
the
ways
of
men
enabled
her
,
without
paying
*NL*
any
heed
to
the
words
that
were
uttered
,
to
conclude
that
men
would
not
*NL*
make
unless
they
were
in
love
;
that
,
from
the
moment
when
they
were
in
*NL*
love
,
it
was
superfluous
to
obey
them
,
since
they
would
only
be
more
in
*NL*
love
later
on
.
And
so
,
she
would
have
heard
Swann
out
with
the
utmost
*NL*
tranquillity
had
she
not
noticed
that
it
was
growing
late
,
and
that
if
*NL*
he
went
on
speaking
for
any
length
of
time
she
would
``
never
''
as
she
told
*NL*
him
with
a
fond
smile
,
obstinate
but
slightly
abashed
,
``
get
there
in
*NL*
time
for
the
Overture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
other
occasions
he
had
assured
himself
that
the
one
thing
which
,
*NL*
more
than
anything
else
,
would
make
him
cease
to
love
her
,
would
be
her
*NL*
refusal
to
abandon
the
habit
of
lying
.
``
Even
from
the
point
of
view
of
*NL*
coquetry
,
pure
and
simple
,
''
he
had
told
her
,
``
ca
n't
you
see
how
much
*NL*
of
your
attraction
you
throw
away
when
you
stoop
to
lying
?
By
a
frank
*NL*
admission
--
how
many
faults
you
might
redeem
!
Really
,
you
are
far
less
*NL*
intelligent
than
I
supposed
!
''
In
vain
,
however
,
did
Swann
expound
to
*NL*
her
thus
all
the
reasons
that
she
had
for
not
lying
;
they
might
have
*NL*
succeeded
in
overthrowing
any
universal
system
of
mendacity
,
but
Odette
*NL*
had
no
such
system
;
she
contented
herself
,
merely
,
whenever
she
wished
*NL*
Swann
to
remain
in
ignorance
of
anything
that
she
had
done
,
with
not
*NL*
telling
him
of
it
.
So
that
a
lie
was
,
to
her
,
something
to
be
used
only
*NL*
as
a
special
expedient
;
and
the
one
thing
that
could
make
her
decide
*NL*
whether
she
should
avail
herself
of
a
lie
or
not
was
a
reason
which
,
*NL*
too
,
was
of
a
special
and
contingent
order
,
namely
the
risk
of
Swann
's
*NL*
discovering
that
she
had
not
told
him
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Physically
,
she
was
passing
through
an
unfortunate
phase
;
she
was
*NL*
growing
stouter
,
and
the
expressive
,
sorrowful
charm
,
the
surprised
,
*NL*
wistful
expressions
which
she
had
formerly
had
,
seemed
to
have
vanished
*NL*
with
her
first
youth
,
with
the
result
that
she
became
most
precious
to
*NL*
Swann
at
the
very
moment
when
he
found
her
distinctly
less
good-looking
.
*NL*
He
would
gaze
at
her
for
hours
on
end
,
trying
to
recapture
the
charm
*NL*
which
he
had
once
seen
in
her
and
could
not
find
again
.
And
yet
the
*NL*
knowledge
that
,
within
this
new
and
strange
chrysalis
,
it
was
still
*NL*
Odette
that
lurked
,
still
the
same
volatile
temperament
,
artful
and
*NL*
evasive
,
was
enough
to
keep
Swann
seeking
,
with
as
much
passion
as
ever
,
*NL*
to
captivate
her
.
Then
he
would
look
at
photographs
of
her
,
taken
two
*NL*
years
before
,
and
would
remember
how
exquisite
she
had
been
.
And
that
*NL*
would
console
him
,
a
little
,
for
all
the
sufferings
that
he
voluntarily
*NL*
endured
on
her
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Verdurins
took
her
off
to
Saint-Germain
,
or
to
Chatou
,
or
to
*NL*
Meulan
,
as
often
as
not
,
if
the
weather
was
fine
,
they
would
propose
*NL*
to
remain
there
for
the
night
,
and
not
go
home
until
next
day
.
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
would
endeavour
to
set
at
rest
the
scruples
of
the
pianist
,
*NL*
whose
aunt
had
remained
in
Paris
:
``
She
will
be
only
too
glad
to
be
rid
*NL*
of
you
for
a
day
.
How
on
earth
could
she
be
anxious
,
when
she
knows
*NL*
you
're
with
us
?
Anyhow
,
I
'll
take
you
all
under
my
wing
;
she
can
put
the
*NL*
blame
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
this
attempt
failed
,
M.
Verdurin
would
set
off
across
country
until
*NL*
he
came
to
a
telegraph
office
or
some
other
kind
of
messenger
,
after
*NL*
first
finding
out
which
of
the
`
faithful
'
had
anyone
whom
they
must
*NL*
warn
.
But
Odette
would
thank
him
,
and
assure
him
that
she
had
no
message
*NL*
for
anyone
,
for
she
had
told
Swann
,
once
and
for
all
,
that
she
could
*NL*
not
possibly
send
messages
to
him
,
before
all
those
people
,
without
*NL*
compromising
herself
.
Sometimes
she
would
be
absent
for
several
days
*NL*
on
end
,
when
the
Verdurins
took
her
to
see
the
tombs
at
Dreux
,
or
to
*NL*
Compiègne
,
on
the
painter
's
advice
,
to
watch
the
sun
setting
through
the
*NL*
forest
--
after
which
they
went
on
to
the
Château
of
Pierrefonds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
think
that
she
could
visit
really
historic
buildings
with
me
,
who
*NL*
have
spent
ten
years
in
the
study
of
architecture
,
who
am
constantly
*NL*
bombarded
,
by
people
who
really
count
,
to
take
them
over
Beauvais
or
*NL*
Saint-Loup-de-Naud
,
and
refuse
to
take
anyone
but
her
;
and
instead
of
*NL*
that
she
trundles
off
with
the
lowest
,
the
most
brutally
degraded
*NL*
of
creatures
,
to
go
into
ecstasies
over
the
petrified
excretions
of
*NL*
Louis-Philippe
and
Viollet-le-Duc
!
One
hardly
needs
much
knowledge
*NL*
of
art
,
I
should
say
,
to
do
that
;
though
,
surely
,
even
without
any
*NL*
particularly
refined
sense
of
smell
,
one
would
not
deliberately
choose
*NL*
to
spend
a
holiday
in
the
latrines
,
so
as
to
be
within
range
of
their
*NL*
fragrant
exhalations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
she
had
set
off
for
Dreux
or
Pierrefonds
--
alas
,
without
*NL*
allowing
him
to
appear
there
,
as
though
by
accident
,
at
her
side
,
for
,
*NL*
as
she
said
,
that
would
``
create
a
dreadful
impression
,
''
--
he
would
plunge
*NL*
into
the
most
intoxicating
romance
in
the
lover
's
library
,
the
railway
*NL*
timetable
,
from
which
he
learned
the
ways
of
joining
her
there
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
in
the
evening
,
even
in
the
morning
.
The
ways
?
More
than
*NL*
that
,
the
authority
,
the
right
to
join
her
.
For
,
after
all
,
the
*NL*
time-table
,
and
the
trains
themselves
,
were
not
meant
for
dogs
.
If
the
*NL*
public
were
carefully
informed
,
by
means
of
printed
advertisements
,
that
*NL*
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
a
train
started
for
Pierrefonds
which
*NL*
arrived
there
at
ten
,
that
could
only
be
because
going
to
Pierrefonds
*NL*
was
a
lawful
act
,
for
which
permission
from
Odette
would
be
superfluous
;
*NL*
an
act
,
moreover
,
which
might
be
performed
from
a
motive
altogether
*NL*
different
from
the
desire
to
see
Odette
,
since
persons
who
had
never
*NL*
even
heard
of
her
performed
it
daily
,
and
in
such
numbers
as
justified
*NL*
the
labour
and
expense
of
stoking
the
engines
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
came
to
this
;
that
she
could
not
prevent
him
from
going
to
*NL*
Pierrefonds
if
he
chose
to
do
so
.
Now
that
was
precisely
what
he
found
*NL*
that
he
did
choose
to
do
,
and
would
at
that
moment
be
doing
were
he
,
*NL*
like
the
travelling
public
,
not
acquainted
with
Odette
.
For
a
long
*NL*
time
past
he
had
wanted
to
form
a
more
definite
impression
of
*NL*
Viollet-le-Duc
's
work
as
a
restorer
.
And
the
weather
being
what
it
was
,
*NL*
he
felt
an
overwhelming
desire
to
spend
the
day
roaming
in
the
forest
of
*NL*
Compiègne
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
piece
of
bad
luck
that
she
had
forbidden
him
access
*NL*
to
the
one
spot
that
tempted
him
to-day
.
To-day
!
Why
,
if
he
went
down
*NL*
there
,
in
defiance
of
her
prohibition
,
he
would
be
able
to
see
her
that
*NL*
very
day
!
But
then
,
whereas
,
if
she
had
met
,
at
Pierrefonds
,
some
one
*NL*
who
did
not
matter
,
she
would
have
hailed
him
with
obvious
pleasure
:
*NL*
``
What
,
you
here
?
''
and
would
have
invited
him
to
come
and
see
her
at
the
*NL*
hotel
where
she
was
staying
with
the
Verdurins
,
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
it
was
himself
,
Swann
,
that
she
encountered
there
,
she
would
be
annoyed
,
*NL*
would
complain
that
she
was
being
followed
,
would
love
him
less
in
*NL*
consequence
,
might
even
turn
away
in
anger
when
she
caught
sight
of
him
.
*NL*
``
So
,
then
,
I
am
not
to
be
allowed
to
go
away
for
a
day
anywhere
!
''
she
*NL*
would
reproach
him
on
her
return
,
whereas
in
fact
it
was
he
himself
who
*NL*
was
not
allowed
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
had
the
sudden
idea
,
so
as
to
contrive
to
visit
Compiègne
and
*NL*
Pierrefonds
without
letting
it
be
supposed
that
his
object
was
to
meet
*NL*
Odette
,
of
securing
an
invitation
from
one
of
his
friends
,
the
Marquis
*NL*
de
Forestelle
,
who
had
a
country
house
in
that
neighbourhood
.
This
*NL*
friend
,
to
whom
Swann
suggested
the
plan
without
disclosing
its
*NL*
ulterior
purpose
,
was
beside
himself
with
joy
;
he
did
not
conceal
his
*NL*
astonishment
at
Swann
's
consenting
at
last
,
after
fifteen
years
,
to
come
*NL*
down
and
visit
his
property
,
and
since
he
did
not
-LRB-
he
told
him
-RRB-
wish
*NL*
to
stay
there
,
promised
to
spend
some
days
,
at
least
,
in
taking
him
for
*NL*
walks
and
excursions
in
the
district
.
Swann
imagined
himself
down
there
*NL*
already
with
M.
de
Forestelle
.
Even
before
he
saw
Odette
,
even
if
he
did
*NL*
not
succeed
in
seeing
her
there
,
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
set
foot
on
*NL*
that
soil
where
,
not
knowing
the
exact
spot
in
which
,
at
any
moment
,
she
*NL*
was
to
be
found
,
he
would
feel
all
around
him
the
thrilling
possibility
*NL*
of
her
suddenly
appearing
:
in
the
courtyard
of
the
Château
,
now
*NL*
beautiful
in
his
eyes
since
it
was
on
her
account
that
he
had
gone
to
*NL*
visit
it
;
in
all
the
streets
of
the
town
,
which
struck
him
as
romantic
;
*NL*
down
every
ride
of
the
forest
,
roseate
with
the
deep
and
tender
glow
of
*NL*
sunset
;
--
innumerable
and
alternative
hiding-places
,
to
which
would
fly
*NL*
simultaneously
for
refuge
,
in
the
uncertain
ubiquity
of
his
hopes
,
his
*NL*
happy
,
vagabond
and
divided
heart
.
``
We
must
n't
,
on
any
account
,
''
he
*NL*
would
warn
M.
de
Forestelle
,
``
run
across
Odette
and
the
Verdurins
.
I
*NL*
have
just
heard
that
they
are
at
Pierrefonds
,
of
all
places
,
to-day
.
One
*NL*
has
plenty
of
time
to
see
them
in
Paris
;
it
would
hardly
be
worth
while
*NL*
coming
down
here
if
one
could
n't
go
a
yard
without
meeting
them
.
''
And
*NL*
his
host
would
fail
to
understand
why
,
once
they
had
reached
the
place
,
*NL*
Swann
would
change
his
plans
twenty
times
in
an
hour
,
inspect
the
*NL*
dining-rooms
of
all
the
hotels
in
Compiègne
without
being
able
to
make
*NL*
up
his
mind
to
settle
down
in
any
of
them
,
although
he
had
found
no
*NL*
trace
anywhere
of
the
Verdurins
,
seeming
to
be
in
search
of
what
he
had
*NL*
claimed
to
be
most
anxious
to
avoid
,
and
would
in
fact
avoid
,
the
moment
*NL*
he
found
it
,
for
if
he
had
come
upon
the
little
`
group
,
'
he
would
have
*NL*
hastened
away
at
once
with
studied
indifference
,
satisfied
that
he
had
*NL*
seen
Odette
and
she
him
,
especially
that
she
had
seen
him
when
he
was
*NL*
not
,
apparently
,
thinking
about
her
.
But
no
;
she
would
guess
at
*NL*
once
that
it
was
for
her
sake
that
he
had
come
there
.
And
when
M.
de
*NL*
Forestelle
came
to
fetch
him
,
and
it
was
time
to
start
,
he
excused
*NL*
himself
:
``
No
,
I
'm
afraid
not
;
I
ca
n't
go
to
Pierrefonds
to-day
.
You
see
,
*NL*
Odette
is
there
.
''
And
Swann
was
happy
in
spite
of
everything
in
feeling
*NL*
that
if
he
,
alone
among
mortals
,
had
not
the
right
to
go
to
Pierrefonds
*NL*
that
day
,
it
was
because
he
was
in
fact
,
for
Odette
,
some
one
who
*NL*
differed
from
all
other
mortals
,
her
lover
;
and
because
that
restriction
*NL*
which
for
him
alone
was
set
upon
the
universal
right
to
travel
freely
*NL*
where
one
would
,
was
but
one
of
the
many
forms
of
that
slavery
,
that
*NL*
love
which
was
so
dear
to
him
.
Decidedly
,
it
was
better
not
to
risk
a
*NL*
quarrel
with
her
,
to
be
patient
,
to
wait
for
her
return
.
He
spent
his
*NL*
days
in
poring
over
a
map
of
the
forest
of
Compiègne
,
as
though
it
*NL*
had
been
that
of
the
`
Pays
du
Tendre
'
;
he
surrounded
himself
with
*NL*
photographs
of
the
Château
of
Pierrefonds
.
When
the
day
dawned
on
which
*NL*
it
was
possible
that
she
might
return
,
he
opened
the
time-table
*NL*
again
,
calculated
what
train
she
must
have
taken
,
and
,
should
she
have
*NL*
postponed
her
departure
,
what
trains
were
still
left
for
her
to
take
.
He
*NL*
did
not
leave
the
house
,
for
fear
of
missing
a
telegram
,
he
did
not
go
*NL*
to
bed
,
in
case
,
having
come
by
the
last
train
,
she
decided
to
surprise
*NL*
him
with
a
midnight
visit
.
Yes
!
The
front-door
bell
rang
.
There
seemed
*NL*
some
delay
in
opening
the
door
,
he
wanted
to
awaken
the
porter
,
he
*NL*
leaned
out
of
the
window
to
shout
to
Odette
,
if
it
was
Odette
,
for
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
orders
which
he
had
gone
downstairs
a
dozen
times
to
*NL*
deliver
in
person
,
they
were
quite
capable
of
telling
her
that
he
was
*NL*
not
at
home
.
It
was
only
a
servant
coming
in
.
He
noticed
the
incessant
*NL*
rumble
of
passing
carriages
,
to
which
he
had
never
before
paid
any
*NL*
attention
.
He
could
hear
them
,
one
after
another
,
a
long
way
off
,
coming
*NL*
nearer
,
passing
his
door
without
stopping
,
and
bearing
away
into
the
*NL*
distance
a
message
which
was
not
for
him
.
He
waited
all
night
,
to
no
*NL*
purpose
,
for
the
Verdurins
had
returned
unexpectedly
,
and
Odette
had
*NL*
been
in
Paris
since
midday
;
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
to
tell
him
;
not
*NL*
knowing
what
to
do
with
herself
she
had
spent
the
evening
alone
at
a
*NL*
theatre
,
had
long
since
gone
home
to
bed
,
and
was
peacefully
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
she
had
never
given
him
a
thought
.
And
such
moments
*NL*
as
these
,
in
which
she
forgot
Swann
's
very
existence
,
were
of
more
value
*NL*
to
Odette
,
did
more
to
attach
him
to
her
,
than
all
her
infidelities
.
For
*NL*
in
this
way
Swann
was
kept
in
that
state
of
painful
agitation
which
had
*NL*
once
before
been
effective
in
making
his
interest
blossom
into
love
,
on
*NL*
the
night
when
he
had
failed
to
find
Odette
at
the
Verdurins
'
and
had
*NL*
hunted
for
her
all
evening
.
And
he
did
not
have
-LRB-
as
I
had
,
afterwards
,
*NL*
at
Combray
in
my
childhood
-RRB-
happy
days
in
which
to
forget
the
sufferings
*NL*
that
would
return
with
the
night
.
For
his
days
,
Swann
must
pass
them
*NL*
without
Odette
;
and
as
he
told
himself
,
now
and
then
,
to
allow
so
pretty
*NL*
a
woman
to
go
out
by
herself
in
Paris
was
just
as
rash
as
to
leave
a
*NL*
case
filled
with
jewels
in
the
middle
of
the
street
.
In
this
mood
he
*NL*
would
scowl
furiously
at
the
passers-by
,
as
though
they
were
so
many
*NL*
pickpockets
.
But
their
faces
--
a
collective
and
formless
mass
--
escaped
*NL*
the
grasp
of
his
imagination
,
and
so
failed
to
feed
the
flame
of
his
*NL*
jealousy
.
The
effort
exhausted
Swann
's
brain
,
until
,
passing
his
hand
*NL*
over
his
eyes
,
he
cried
out
:
``
Heaven
help
me
!
''
as
people
,
after
lashing
*NL*
themselves
into
an
intellectual
frenzy
in
their
endeavours
to
master
the
*NL*
problem
of
the
reality
of
the
external
world
,
or
that
of
the
immortality
*NL*
of
the
soul
,
afford
relief
to
their
weary
brains
by
an
unreasoning
*NL*
act
of
faith
.
But
the
thought
of
his
absent
mistress
was
incessantly
,
*NL*
indissolubly
blended
with
all
the
simplest
actions
of
Swann
's
daily
*NL*
life
--
when
he
took
his
meals
,
opened
his
letters
,
went
for
a
walk
or
*NL*
to
bed
--
by
the
fact
of
his
regret
at
having
to
perform
those
actions
*NL*
without
her
;
like
those
initials
of
Philibert
the
Fair
which
,
in
the
*NL*
church
of
Brou
,
because
of
her
grief
,
her
longing
for
him
,
Margaret
of
*NL*
Austria
intertwined
everywhere
with
her
own
.
On
some
days
,
instead
of
*NL*
staying
at
home
,
he
would
go
for
luncheon
to
a
restaurant
not
far
off
,
*NL*
to
which
he
had
been
attracted
,
some
time
before
,
by
the
excellence
of
*NL*
its
cookery
,
but
to
which
he
now
went
only
for
one
of
those
reasons
,
*NL*
at
once
mystical
and
absurd
,
which
people
call
`
romantic
'
;
because
this
*NL*
restaurant
-LRB-
which
,
by
the
way
,
still
exists
-RRB-
bore
the
same
name
as
the
*NL*
street
in
which
Odette
lived
:
the
Lapérouse
.
Sometimes
,
when
she
had
*NL*
been
away
on
a
short
visit
somewhere
,
several
days
would
elapse
before
*NL*
she
thought
of
letting
him
know
that
she
had
returned
to
Paris
.
And
*NL*
then
she
would
say
quite
simply
,
without
taking
-LRB-
as
she
would
once
have
*NL*
taken
-RRB-
the
precaution
of
covering
herself
,
at
all
costs
,
with
a
little
*NL*
fragment
borrowed
from
the
truth
,
that
she
had
just
,
at
that
very
*NL*
moment
,
arrived
by
the
morning
train
.
What
she
said
was
a
falsehood
;
*NL*
at
least
for
Odette
it
was
a
falsehood
,
inconsistent
,
lacking
-LRB-
what
it
*NL*
would
have
had
,
if
true
-RRB-
the
support
of
her
memory
of
her
actual
arrival
*NL*
at
the
station
;
she
was
even
prevented
from
forming
a
mental
picture
of
*NL*
what
she
was
saying
,
while
she
said
it
,
by
the
contradictory
picture
,
in
*NL*
her
mind
,
of
whatever
quite
different
thing
she
had
indeed
been
doing
at
*NL*
the
moment
when
she
pretended
to
have
been
alighting
from
the
train
.
In
*NL*
Swann
's
mind
,
however
,
these
words
,
meeting
no
opposition
,
settled
*NL*
and
hardened
until
they
assumed
the
indestructibility
of
a
truth
so
*NL*
indubitable
that
,
if
some
friend
happened
to
tell
him
that
he
had
*NL*
come
by
the
same
train
and
had
not
seen
Odette
,
Swann
would
have
been
*NL*
convinced
that
it
was
his
friend
who
had
made
a
mistake
as
to
the
day
or
*NL*
hour
,
since
his
version
did
not
agree
with
the
words
uttered
by
Odette
.
*NL*
These
words
had
never
appeared
to
him
false
except
when
,
before
hearing
*NL*
them
,
he
had
suspected
that
they
were
going
to
be
.
For
him
to
believe
*NL*
that
she
was
lying
,
an
anticipatory
suspicion
was
indispensable
.
It
was
*NL*
also
,
however
,
sufficient
.
Given
that
,
everything
that
Odette
might
say
*NL*
appeared
to
him
suspect
.
Did
she
mention
a
name
:
it
was
obviously
that
*NL*
of
one
of
her
lovers
;
once
this
supposition
had
taken
shape
,
he
would
*NL*
spend
weeks
in
tormenting
himself
;
on
one
occasion
he
even
approached
a
*NL*
firm
of
`
inquiry
agents
'
to
find
out
the
address
and
the
occupation
of
*NL*
the
unknown
rival
who
would
give
him
no
peace
until
he
could
be
proved
*NL*
to
have
gone
abroad
,
and
who
-LRB-
he
ultimately
learned
-RRB-
was
an
uncle
of
*NL*
Odette
,
and
had
been
dead
for
twenty
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
she
would
not
allow
him
,
as
a
rule
,
to
meet
her
at
public
*NL*
gatherings
,
saying
that
people
would
talk
,
it
happened
occasionally
*NL*
that
,
at
an
evening
party
to
which
he
and
she
had
each
been
invited
--
at
*NL*
Forcheville
's
,
at
the
painter
's
,
or
at
a
charity
ball
given
in
one
of
*NL*
the
Ministries
--
he
found
himself
in
the
same
room
with
her
.
He
could
*NL*
see
her
,
but
dared
not
remain
for
fear
of
annoying
her
by
seeming
to
be
*NL*
spying
upon
the
pleasures
which
she
tasted
in
other
company
,
pleasures
*NL*
which
--
while
he
drove
home
in
utter
loneliness
,
and
went
to
bed
,
*NL*
as
anxiously
as
I
myself
was
to
go
to
bed
,
some
years
later
,
on
the
*NL*
evenings
when
he
came
to
dine
with
us
at
Combray
--
seemed
illimitable
to
*NL*
him
since
he
had
not
been
able
to
see
their
end
.
And
,
once
or
twice
,
*NL*
he
derived
from
such
evenings
that
kind
of
happiness
which
one
would
be
*NL*
inclined
-LRB-
did
it
not
originate
in
so
violent
a
reaction
from
an
anxiety
*NL*
abruptly
terminated
-RRB-
to
call
peaceful
,
since
it
consists
in
a
pacifying
*NL*
of
the
mind
:
he
had
looked
in
for
a
moment
at
a
revel
in
the
painter
's
*NL*
studio
,
and
was
getting
ready
to
go
home
;
he
was
leaving
behind
him
*NL*
Odette
,
transformed
into
a
brilliant
stranger
,
surrounded
by
men
to
whom
*NL*
her
glances
and
her
gaiety
,
which
were
not
for
him
,
seemed
to
hint
at
*NL*
some
voluptuous
pleasure
to
be
enjoyed
there
or
elsewhere
-LRB-
possibly
at
*NL*
the
Bal
des
Incohérents
,
to
which
he
trembled
to
think
that
she
might
be
*NL*
going
on
afterwards
-RRB-
which
made
Swann
more
jealous
than
the
thought
of
*NL*
their
actual
physical
union
,
since
it
was
more
difficult
to
imagine
;
he
*NL*
was
opening
the
door
to
go
,
when
he
heard
himself
called
back
in
these
*NL*
words
-LRB-
which
,
by
cutting
off
from
the
party
that
possible
ending
which
*NL*
had
so
appalled
him
,
made
the
party
itself
seem
innocent
in
retrospect
,
*NL*
made
Odette
's
return
home
a
thing
no
longer
inconceivable
and
terrible
,
*NL*
but
tender
and
familiar
,
a
thing
that
kept
close
to
his
side
,
like
*NL*
a
part
of
his
own
daily
life
,
in
his
carriage
;
a
thing
that
stripped
*NL*
Odette
herself
of
the
excess
of
brilliance
and
gaiety
in
her
appearance
,
*NL*
shewed
that
it
was
only
a
disguise
which
she
had
assumed
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
for
his
sake
and
not
in
view
of
any
mysterious
pleasures
,
a
disguise
of
*NL*
which
she
had
already
wearied
-RRB-
--
in
these
words
,
which
Odette
flung
out
*NL*
after
him
as
he
was
crossing
the
threshold
:
``
Ca
n't
you
wait
a
minute
for
*NL*
me
?
I
'm
just
going
;
we
'll
drive
back
together
and
you
can
drop
me
.
''
It
*NL*
was
true
that
on
one
occasion
Forcheville
had
asked
to
be
driven
home
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
but
when
,
on
reaching
Odette
's
gate
,
he
had
begged
to
be
*NL*
allowed
to
come
in
too
,
she
had
replied
,
with
a
finger
pointed
at
Swann
:
*NL*
``
Ah
!
That
depends
on
this
gentleman
.
You
must
ask
him
.
Very
well
,
you
*NL*
may
come
in
,
just
for
a
minute
,
if
you
insist
,
but
you
must
n't
stay
*NL*
long
,
for
,
I
warn
you
,
he
likes
to
sit
and
talk
quietly
with
me
,
and
*NL*
he
's
not
at
all
pleased
if
I
have
visitors
when
he
's
here
.
Oh
,
if
you
*NL*
only
knew
the
creature
as
I
know
him
;
is
n't
that
so
,
my
love
,
there
's
no
*NL*
one
that
really
knows
you
,
is
there
,
except
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Swann
was
,
perhaps
,
even
more
touched
by
the
spectacle
of
her
*NL*
addressing
him
thus
,
in
front
of
Forcheville
,
not
only
in
these
tender
*NL*
words
of
predilection
,
but
also
with
certain
criticisms
,
such
as
:
``
I
*NL*
feel
sure
you
have
n't
written
yet
to
your
friends
,
about
dining
with
*NL*
them
on
Sunday
.
You
need
n't
go
if
you
do
n't
want
to
,
but
you
might
at
*NL*
least
be
polite
,
''
or
``
Now
,
have
you
left
your
essay
on
Vermeer
here
,
so
*NL*
that
you
can
do
a
little
more
to
it
to-morrow
?
What
a
lazy-bones
!
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
make
you
work
,
I
can
tell
you
,
''
which
proved
that
Odette
kept
*NL*
herself
in
touch
with
his
social
engagements
and
his
literary
work
,
that
*NL*
they
had
indeed
a
life
in
common
.
And
as
she
spoke
she
bestowed
on
him
a
*NL*
smile
which
he
interpreted
as
meaning
that
she
was
entirely
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
while
she
was
making
them
some
orangeade
,
suddenly
,
just
as
*NL*
when
the
reflector
of
a
lamp
that
is
badly
fitted
begins
by
casting
*NL*
all
round
an
object
,
on
the
wall
beyond
it
,
huge
and
fantastic
shadows
*NL*
which
,
in
time
,
contract
and
are
lost
in
the
shadow
of
the
object
*NL*
itself
,
all
the
terrible
and
disturbing
ideas
which
he
had
formed
of
*NL*
Odette
melted
away
and
vanished
in
the
charming
creature
who
stood
there
*NL*
before
his
eyes
.
He
had
the
sudden
suspicion
that
this
hour
spent
in
*NL*
Odette
's
house
,
in
the
lamp-light
,
was
,
perhaps
,
after
all
,
not
an
*NL*
artificial
hour
,
invented
for
his
special
use
-LRB-
with
the
object
of
*NL*
concealing
that
frightening
and
delicious
thing
which
was
incessantly
*NL*
in
his
thoughts
without
his
ever
being
able
to
form
a
satisfactory
*NL*
impression
of
it
,
an
hour
of
Odette
's
real
life
,
of
her
life
when
he
was
*NL*
not
there
,
looking
on
-RRB-
with
theatrical
properties
and
pasteboard
fruits
,
*NL*
but
was
perhaps
a
genuine
hour
of
Odette
's
life
;
that
,
if
he
himself
*NL*
had
not
been
there
,
she
would
have
pulled
forward
the
same
armchair
for
*NL*
Forcheville
,
would
have
poured
out
for
him
,
not
any
unknown
brew
,
but
*NL*
precisely
that
orangeade
which
she
was
now
offering
to
them
both
;
that
*NL*
the
world
inhabited
by
Odette
was
not
that
other
world
,
fearful
and
*NL*
supernatural
,
in
which
he
spent
his
time
in
placing
her
--
and
which
*NL*
existed
,
perhaps
,
only
in
his
imagination
,
but
the
real
universe
,
*NL*
exhaling
no
special
atmosphere
of
gloom
,
comprising
that
table
at
which
*NL*
he
might
sit
down
,
presently
,
and
write
,
and
this
drink
which
he
was
*NL*
being
permitted
,
now
,
to
taste
;
all
the
objects
which
he
contemplated
*NL*
with
as
much
curiosity
and
admiration
as
gratitude
,
for
if
,
in
absorbing
*NL*
his
dreams
,
they
had
delivered
him
from
an
obsession
,
they
themselves
*NL*
were
,
in
turn
,
enriched
by
the
absorption
;
they
shewed
him
the
palpable
*NL*
realisation
of
his
fancies
,
and
they
interested
his
mind
;
they
took
*NL*
shape
and
grew
solid
before-his
eyes
,
and
at
the
same
time
they
soothed
*NL*
his
troubled
heart
.
Ah
!
had
fate
but
allowed
him
to
share
a
single
*NL*
dwelling
with
Odette
,
so
that
in
her
house
he
should
be
in
his
own
;
if
,
*NL*
when
asking
his
servant
what
there
would
be
for
luncheon
,
it
had
been
*NL*
Odette
's
bill
of
fare
that
he
had
learned
from
the
reply
;
if
,
when
*NL*
Odette
wished
to
go
for
a
walk
,
in
the
morning
,
along
the
Avenue
du
*NL*
Bois-de-Boulogne
,
his
duty
as
a
good
husband
had
obliged
him
,
though
he
*NL*
had
no
desire
to
go
out
,
to
accompany
her
,
carrying
her
cloak
when
she
*NL*
was
too
warm
;
and
in
the
evening
,
after
dinner
,
if
she
wished
to
stay
at
*NL*
home
,
and
not
to
dress
,
if
he
had
been
forced
to
stay
beside
her
,
to
*NL*
do
what
she
asked
;
then
how
completely
would
all
the
trivial
details
*NL*
of
Swann
's
life
,
which
seemed
to
him
now
so
gloomy
,
simply
because
they
*NL*
would
,
at
the
same
time
,
have
formed
part
of
the
life
of
Odette
,
have
*NL*
taken
on
--
like
that
lamp
,
that
orangeade
,
that
armchair
,
which
had
*NL*
absorbed
so
much
of
his
dreams
,
which
materialised
so
much
of
his
*NL*
longing
,
--
a
sort
of
superabundant
sweetness
and
a
mysterious
solidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
was
inclined
to
suspect
that
the
state
for
which
he
so
much
*NL*
longed
was
a
calm
,
a
peace
,
which
would
not
have
created
an
atmosphere
*NL*
favourable
to
his
love
.
When
Odette
ceased
to
be
for
him
a
creature
*NL*
always
absent
,
regretted
,
imagined
;
when
the
feeling
that
he
had
for
her
*NL*
was
no
longer
the
same
mysterious
disturbance
that
was
wrought
in
him
by
*NL*
the
phrase
from
the
sonata
,
but
constant
affection
and
gratitude
,
when
*NL*
those
normal
relations
were
established
between
them
which
would
put
an
*NL*
end
to
his
melancholy
madness
;
then
,
no
doubt
,
the
actions
of
Odette
's
*NL*
daily
life
would
appear
to
him
as
being
of
but
little
intrinsic
*NL*
interest
--
as
he
had
several
times
,
already
,
felt
that
they
might
be
,
*NL*
on
the
day
,
for
instance
,
when
he
had
read
,
through
its
envelope
,
her
*NL*
letter
to
Forcheville
.
Examining
his
complaint
with
as
much
scientific
*NL*
detachment
as
if
he
had
inoculated
himself
with
it
in
order
to
study
*NL*
its
effects
,
he
told
himself
that
,
when
he
was
cured
of
it
,
what
Odette
*NL*
might
or
might
not
do
would
be
indifferent
to
him
.
But
in
his
morbid
*NL*
state
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
he
feared
death
itself
no
more
than
such
a
*NL*
recovery
,
which
would
,
in
fact
,
amount
to
the
death
of
all
that
he
then
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
these
quiet
evenings
,
Swann
's
suspicions
would
be
temporarily
*NL*
lulled
;
he
would
bless
the
name
of
Odette
,
and
next
day
,
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
would
order
the
most
attractive
jewels
to
be
sent
to
her
,
because
her
*NL*
kindnesses
to
him
overnight
had
excited
either
his
gratitude
,
or
the
*NL*
desire
to
see
them
repeated
,
or
a
paroxysm
of
love
for
her
which
had
*NL*
need
of
some
such
outlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
other
times
,
grief
would
again
take
hold
of
him
;
he
would
imagine
*NL*
that
Odette
was
Forcheville
's
mistress
,
and
that
,
when
they
had
both
sat
*NL*
watching
him
from
the
depths
of
the
Verdurins
'
landau
,
in
the
Bois
,
on
*NL*
the
evening
before
the
party
at
Chatou
to
which
he
had
not
been
invited
,
*NL*
while
he
implored
her
in
vain
,
with
that
look
of
despair
on
his
face
*NL*
which
even
his
coachman
had
noticed
,
to
come
home
with
him
,
and
then
*NL*
turned
away
,
solitary
,
crushed
,
--
she
must
have
employed
,
to
draw
*NL*
Forcheville
's
attention
to
him
,
while
she
murmured
:
``
Do
look
at
him
,
*NL*
storming
!
''
the
same
glance
,
brilliant
,
malicious
,
sidelong
,
cunning
,
as
*NL*
on
the
evening
when
Forcheville
had
driven
Saniette
from
the
Verdurins
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
such
times
Swann
detested
her
.
``
But
I
've
been
a
fool
,
too
,
''
he
would
*NL*
argue
.
``
I
'm
paying
for
other
men
's
pleasures
with
my
money
.
All
the
*NL*
same
,
she
'd
better
take
care
,
and
not
pull
the
string
too
often
,
for
*NL*
I
might
very
well
stop
giving
her
anything
at
all
.
At
any
rate
,
we
'd
*NL*
better
knock
off
supplementary
favours
for
the
time
being
.
To
think
*NL*
that
,
only
yesterday
,
when
she
said
she
would
like
to
go
to
Bayreuth
*NL*
for
the
season
,
I
was
such
an
ass
as
to
offer
to
take
one
of
those
jolly
*NL*
little
places
the
King
of
Bavaria
has
there
,
for
the
two
of
us
.
However
*NL*
she
did
n't
seem
particularly
keen
;
she
has
n't
said
yes
or
no
yet
.
Let
's
*NL*
hope
that
she
'll
refuse
.
Good
God
!
Think
of
listening
to
Wagner
for
a
*NL*
fortnight
on
end
with
her
,
who
takes
about
as
much
interest
in
music
as
*NL*
a
fish
does
in
little
apples
;
it
will
be
fun
!
''
And
his
hatred
,
like
*NL*
his
love
,
needing
to
manifest
itself
in
action
,
he
amused
himself
with
*NL*
urging
his
evil
imaginings
further
and
further
,
because
,
thanks
to
the
*NL*
perfidies
with
which
he
charged
Odette
,
he
detested
her
still
more
,
and
*NL*
would
be
able
,
if
it
turned
out
--
as
he
tried
to
convince
himself
--
that
*NL*
she
was
indeed
guilty
of
them
,
to
take
the
opportunity
of
punishing
her
,
*NL*
emptying
upon
her
the
overflowing
vials
of
his
wrath
.
In
this
way
,
he
*NL*
went
so
far
as
to
suppose
that
he
was
going
to
receive
a
letter
from
*NL*
her
,
in
which
she
would
ask
him
for
money
to
take
the
house
at
Bayreuth
,
*NL*
but
with
the
warning
that
he
was
not
to
come
there
himself
,
as
she
had
*NL*
promised
Forcheville
and
the
Verdurins
to
invite
them
.
Oh
,
how
he
*NL*
would
have
loved
it
,
had
it
been
conceivable
that
she
would
have
*NL*
that
audacity
.
What
joy
he
would
have
in
refusing
,
in
drawing
up
that
*NL*
vindictive
reply
,
the
terms
of
which
he
amused
himself
by
selecting
and
*NL*
declaiming
aloud
,
as
though
he
had
actually
received
her
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
next
day
,
her
letter
came
.
She
wrote
that
the
Verdurins
and
*NL*
their
friends
had
expressed
a
desire
to
be
present
at
these
performances
*NL*
of
Wagner
,
and
that
,
if
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
send
her
the
money
,
*NL*
she
would
be
able
at
last
,
after
going
so
often
to
their
house
,
to
have
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
entertaining
the
Verdurins
in
hers
.
Of
him
she
said
not
*NL*
a
word
;
it
was
to
be
taken
for
granted
that
their
presence
at
Bayreuth
*NL*
would
be
a
bar
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
that
annihilating
answer
,
every
word
of
which
he
had
carefully
*NL*
rehearsed
overnight
,
without
venturing
to
hope
that
it
could
ever
be
*NL*
used
,
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
having
it
conveyed
to
her
.
Alas
!
he
*NL*
felt
only
too
certain
that
with
the
money
which
she
had
,
or
could
easily
*NL*
procure
,
she
would
be
able
,
all
the
same
,
to
take
a
house
at
Bayreuth
,
*NL*
since
she
wished
to
do
so
,
she
who
was
incapable
of
distinguishing
*NL*
between
Bach
and
Clapisson
.
Let
her
take
it
,
then
;
she
would
have
to
*NL*
live
in
it
more
frugally
,
that
was
all
.
No
means
-LRB-
as
there
would
have
*NL*
been
if
he
had
replied
by
sending
her
several
thousand-franc
notes
-RRB-
of
*NL*
organising
,
each
evening
,
in
her
hired
castle
,
those
exquisite
little
*NL*
suppers
,
after
which
she
might
perhaps
be
seized
by
the
whim
-LRB-
which
,
*NL*
it
was
possible
,
had
never
yet
seized
her
-RRB-
of
falling
into
the
arms
of
*NL*
Forcheville
.
At
any
rate
,
this
loathsome
expedition
,
it
would
not
be
*NL*
Swann
who
had
to
pay
for
it
.
Ah
!
if
he
could
only
manage
to
prevent
*NL*
it
,
if
she
could
sprain
her
ankle
before
starting
,
if
the
driver
of
the
*NL*
carriage
which
was
to
take
her
to
the
station
would
consent
-LRB-
no
matter
*NL*
how
great
the
bribe
-RRB-
to
smuggle
her
to
some
place
where
she
could
be
*NL*
kept
for
a
time
in
seclusion
,
that
perfidious
woman
,
her
eyes
tinselled
*NL*
with
a
smile
of
complicity
for
Forcheville
,
which
was
what
Odette
had
*NL*
become
for
Swann
in
the
last
forty-eight
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
never
that
for
very
long
;
after
a
few
days
the
shining
,
*NL*
crafty
eyes
lost
their
brightness
and
their
duplicity
,
that
picture
of
*NL*
an
execrable
Odette
saying
to
Forcheville
:
``
Look
at
him
storming
!
''
began
*NL*
to
grow
pale
and
to
dissolve
.
Then
gradually
reappeared
and
rose
before
*NL*
him
,
softly
radiant
,
the
face
of
the
other
Odette
,
of
that
Odette
who
*NL*
also
turned
with
a
smile
to
Forcheville
,
but
with
a
smile
in
which
there
*NL*
was
nothing
but
affection
for
Swann
,
when
she
said
:
``
You
must
n't
stay
*NL*
long
,
for
this
gentleman
does
n't
much
like
my
having
visitors
when
he
's
*NL*
here
.
Oh
!
if
you
only
knew
the
creature
as
I
know
him
!
''
that
same
smile
*NL*
with
which
she
used
to
thank
Swann
for
some
instance
of
his
courtesy
*NL*
which
she
prized
so
highly
,
for
some
advice
for
which
she
had
asked
him
*NL*
in
one
of
those
grave
crises
in
her
life
,
when
she
could
turn
to
him
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
to
this
other
Odette
,
he
would
ask
himself
what
could
have
induced
*NL*
him
to
write
that
outrageous
letter
,
of
which
,
probably
,
until
then
,
*NL*
she
had
never
supposed
him
capable
,
a
letter
which
must
have
lowered
him
*NL*
from
the
high
,
from
the
supreme
place
which
,
by
his
generosity
,
by
his
*NL*
loyalty
,
he
had
won
for
himself
in
her
esteem
.
He
would
become
less
dear
*NL*
to
her
,
since
it
was
for
those
qualities
,
which
she
found
neither
in
*NL*
Forcheville
nor
in
any
other
,
that
she
loved
him
.
It
was
for
them
that
*NL*
Odette
so
often
shewed
him
a
reciprocal
kindness
,
which
counted
for
less
*NL*
than
nothing
in
his
moments
of
jealousy
,
because
it
was
not
a
sign
of
*NL*
reciprocal
desire
,
was
indeed
a
proof
rather
of
affection
than
of
love
,
*NL*
but
the
importance
of
which
he
began
once
more
to
feel
in
proportion
as
*NL*
the
spontaneous
relaxation
of
his
suspicions
,
often
accelerated
by
the
*NL*
distraction
brought
to
him
by
reading
about
art
or
by
the
conversation
*NL*
of
a
friend
,
rendered
his
passion
less
exacting
of
reciprocities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
,
after
this
swing
of
the
pendulum
,
Odette
had
naturally
*NL*
returned
to
the
place
from
which
Swann
's
jealousy
had
for
the
moment
*NL*
driven
her
,
in
the
angle
in
which
he
found
her
charming
,
he
pictured
her
*NL*
to
himself
as
full
of
tenderness
,
with
a
look
of
consent
in
her
eyes
,
*NL*
and
so
beautiful
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
moving
his
lips
towards
*NL*
her
,
as
though
she
had
actually
been
in
the
room
for
him
to
kiss
;
and
*NL*
he
preserved
a
sense
of
gratitude
to
her
for
that
bewitching
,
kindly
*NL*
glance
,
as
strong
as
though
she
had
really
looked
thus
at
him
,
and
it
*NL*
had
not
been
merely
his
imagination
that
had
portrayed
it
in
order
to
*NL*
satisfy
his
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
distress
he
must
have
caused
her
!
Certainly
he
found
adequate
*NL*
reasons
for
his
resentment
,
but
they
would
not
have
been
sufficient
to
*NL*
make
him
feel
that
resentment
,
if
he
had
not
so
passionately
loved
her
.
*NL*
Had
he
not
nourished
grievances
,
just
as
serious
,
against
other
women
,
*NL*
to
whom
he
would
,
none
the
less
,
render
willing
service
to-day
,
feeling
*NL*
no
anger
towards
them
because
he
no
longer
loved
them
?
If
the
day
ever
*NL*
came
when
he
would
find
himself
in
the
same
state
of
indifference
with
*NL*
regard
to
Odette
,
he
would
then
understand
that
it
was
his
jealousy
*NL*
alone
which
had
led
him
to
find
something
atrocious
,
unpardonable
,
in
*NL*
this
desire
-LRB-
after
all
,
so
natural
a
desire
,
springing
from
a
childlike
*NL*
ingenuousness
and
also
from
a
certain
delicacy
in
her
nature
-RRB-
to
be
*NL*
able
,
in
her
turn
,
when
an
occasion
offered
,
to
repay
the
Verdurins
for
*NL*
their
hospitality
,
and
to
play
the
hostess
in
a
house
of
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
the
other
point
of
view
--
opposite
to
that
of
his
love
*NL*
and
of
his
jealousy
,
to
which
he
resorted
at
times
by
a
sort
of
mental
*NL*
equity
,
and
in
order
to
make
allowance
for
different
eventualities
--
from
*NL*
which
he
tried
to
form
a
fresh
judgment
of
Odette
,
based
on
the
*NL*
supposition
that
he
had
never
been
in
love
with
her
,
that
she
was
to
him
*NL*
just
a
woman
like
other
women
,
that
her
life
had
not
been
-LRB-
whenever
he
*NL*
himself
was
not
present
-RRB-
different
,
a
texture
woven
in
secret
apart
from
*NL*
him
,
and
warped
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wherefore
believe
that
she
would
enjoy
down
there
with
Forcheville
or
*NL*
with
other
men
intoxicating
pleasures
which
she
had
never
known
with
*NL*
him
,
and
which
his
jealousy
alone
had
fabricated
in
all
their
elements
?
*NL*
At
Bayreuth
,
as
in
Paris
,
if
it
should
happen
that
Forcheville
thought
*NL*
of
him
at
all
,
it
would
only
be
as
of
some
one
who
counted
for
a
great
*NL*
deal
in
the
life
of
Odette
,
some
one
for
whom
he
was
obliged
to
make
*NL*
way
,
when
they
met
in
her
house
.
If
Forcheville
and
she
scored
a
*NL*
triumph
by
being
down
there
together
in
spite
of
him
,
it
was
he
who
had
*NL*
engineered
that
triumph
by
striving
in
vain
to
prevent
her
from
going
*NL*
there
,
whereas
if
he
had
approved
of
her
plan
,
which
for
that
matter
was
*NL*
quite
defensible
,
she
would
have
had
the
appearance
of
being
there
by
*NL*
his
counsel
,
she
would
have
felt
herself
sent
there
,
housed
there
by
*NL*
him
,
and
for
the
pleasure
which
she
derived
from
entertaining
those
*NL*
people
who
had
so
often
entertained
her
,
it
was
to
him
that
she
would
*NL*
have
had
to
acknowledge
her
indebtedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
--
instead
of
letting
her
go
off
thus
,
at
cross-purposes
with
him
,
*NL*
without
having
seen
him
again
--
he
were
to
send
her
this
money
,
if
he
*NL*
were
to
encourage
her
to
take
this
journey
,
and
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
*NL*
make
it
comfortable
and
pleasant
for
her
,
she
would
come
running
to
him
,
*NL*
happy
,
grateful
,
and
he
would
have
the
joy
--
the
sight
of
her
face
--
which
*NL*
he
had
not
known
for
nearly
a
week
,
a
joy
which
none
other
could
*NL*
replace
.
For
the
moment
that
Swann
was
able
to
form
a
picture
of
her
*NL*
without
revulsion
,
that
he
could
see
once
again
the
friendliness
in
*NL*
her
smile
,
and
that
the
desire
to
tear
her
away
from
every
rival
was
*NL*
no
longer
imposed
by
his
jealousy
upon
his
love
,
that
love
once
again
*NL*
became
,
more
than
anything
,
a
taste
for
the
sensations
which
Odette
's
*NL*
person
gave
him
,
for
the
pleasure
which
he
found
in
admiring
,
as
one
*NL*
might
a
spectacle
,
or
in
questioning
,
as
one
might
a
phenomenon
,
the
*NL*
birth
of
one
of
her
glances
,
the
formation
of
one
of
her
smiles
,
the
*NL*
utterance
of
an
intonation
of
her
voice
.
And
this
pleasure
,
different
*NL*
from
every
other
,
had
in
the
end
created
in
him
a
need
of
her
,
which
*NL*
she
alone
,
by
her
presence
or
by
her
letters
,
could
assuage
,
almost
as
*NL*
disinterested
,
almost
as
artistic
,
as
perverse
as
another
need
which
*NL*
characterised
this
new
period
in
Swann
's
life
,
when
the
sereness
,
*NL*
the
depression
of
the
preceding
years
had
been
followed
by
a
sort
of
*NL*
spiritual
superabundance
,
without
his
knowing
to
what
he
owed
this
*NL*
unlooked-for
enrichment
of
his
life
,
any
more
than
a
person
in
delicate
*NL*
health
who
from
a
certain
moment
grows
stronger
,
puts
on
flesh
,
and
*NL*
seems
for
a
time
to
be
on
the
road
to
a
complete
recovery
:
--
this
*NL*
other
need
,
which
,
too
,
developed
in
him
independently
of
the
visible
,
*NL*
material
world
,
was
the
need
to
listen
to
music
and
to
learn
to
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
by
the
chemical
process
of
his
malady
,
after
he
had
created
*NL*
jealousy
out
of
his
love
,
he
began
again
to
generate
tenderness
,
pity
*NL*
for
Odette
.
She
had
become
once
more
the
old
Odette
,
charming
and
kind
.
*NL*
He
was
full
of
remorse
for
having
treated
her
harshly
.
He
wished
her
to
*NL*
come
to
him
,
and
,
before
she
came
,
he
wished
to
have
already
procured
*NL*
for
her
some
pleasure
,
so
as
to
watch
her
gratitude
taking
shape
in
her
*NL*
face
and
moulding
her
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
too
,
Odette
,
certain
of
seeing
him
come
to
her
in
a
few
days
,
*NL*
as
tender
and
submissive
as
before
,
and
plead
with
her
for
a
*NL*
reconciliation
,
became
inured
,
was
no
longer
afraid
of
displeasing
him
,
*NL*
or
even
of
making
him
angry
,
and
refused
him
,
whenever
it
suited
her
,
*NL*
the
favours
by
which
he
set
most
store
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
she
did
not
realise
how
sincere
he
had
been
with
her
during
*NL*
their
quarrel
,
when
he
had
told
her
that
he
would
not
send
her
any
*NL*
money
,
but
would
do
what
he
could
to
hurt
her
.
Perhaps
she
did
not
*NL*
realise
,
either
,
how
sincere
he
still
was
,
if
not
with
her
,
at
any
rate
*NL*
with
himself
,
on
other
occasions
when
,
for
the
sake
of
their
future
*NL*
relations
,
to
shew
Odette
that
he
was
capable
of
doing
without
her
,
that
*NL*
a
rupture
was
still
possible
between
them
,
he
decided
to
wait
some
time
*NL*
before
going
to
see
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
several
days
had
elapsed
,
during
which
she
had
caused
him
no
*NL*
fresh
anxiety
;
and
as
,
from
the
next
few
visits
which
he
would
pay
her
,
*NL*
he
knew
that
he
was
likely
to
derive
not
any
great
pleasure
,
but
,
more
*NL*
probably
,
some
annoyance
which
would
put
an
end
to
the
state
of
calm
in
*NL*
which
he
found
himself
,
he
wrote
to
her
that
he
was
very
busy
,
and
*NL*
would
not
be
able
to
see
her
on
any
of
the
days
that
he
had
suggested
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
a
letter
from
her
,
crossing
his
,
asked
him
to
postpone
one
of
*NL*
those
very
meetings
.
He
asked
himself
,
why
;
his
suspicions
,
his
grief
,
*NL*
again
took
hold
of
him
.
He
could
no
longer
abide
,
in
the
new
state
of
*NL*
agitation
into
which
he
found
himself
plunged
,
by
the
arrangements
which
*NL*
he
had
made
in
his
preceding
state
of
comparative
calm
;
he
would
run
*NL*
to
find
her
,
and
would
insist
upon
seeing
her
on
each
of
the
following
*NL*
days
.
And
even
if
she
had
not
written
first
,
if
she
merely
acknowledged
*NL*
his
letter
,
it
was
enough
to
make
him
unable
to
rest
without
seeing
*NL*
her
.
For
,
upsetting
all
Swann
's
calculations
,
Odette
's
acceptance
had
*NL*
entirely
changed
his
attitude
.
Like
everyone
who
possesses
something
*NL*
precious
,
so
as
to
know
what
would
happen
if
he
ceased
for
a
moment
to
*NL*
possess
it
,
he
had
detached
the
precious
object
from
his
mind
,
leaving
,
*NL*
as
he
thought
,
everything
else
in
the
same
state
as
when
it
was
there
.
*NL*
But
the
absence
of
one
part
from
a
whole
is
not
only
that
,
it
is
not
*NL*
simply
a
partial
omission
,
it
is
a
disturbance
of
all
the
other
parts
,
a
*NL*
new
state
which
it
was
impossible
to
foresee
from
the
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
other
times
--
when
Odette
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
for
a
*NL*
holiday
--
it
was
after
some
trifling
quarrel
for
which
he
had
chosen
the
*NL*
pretext
,
that
he
decided
not
to
write
to
her
and
not
to
see
her
until
*NL*
her
return
,
giving
the
appearance
-LRB-
and
expecting
the
reward
-RRB-
of
*NL*
a
serious
rupture
,
which
she
would
perhaps
regard
as
final
,
to
a
*NL*
separation
,
the
greater
part
of
which
was
inevitable
,
since
she
was
*NL*
going
away
,
which
,
in
fact
,
he
was
merely
allowing
to
start
a
little
*NL*
sooner
than
it
must
.
At
once
he
could
imagine
Odette
,
puzzled
,
anxious
,
*NL*
distressed
at
having
received
neither
visit
nor
letter
from
him
and
this
*NL*
picture
of
her
,
by
calming
his
jealousy
,
made
it
easy
for
him
to
break
*NL*
himself
of
the
habit
of
seeing
her
.
At
odd
moments
,
no
doubt
,
in
the
*NL*
furthest
recesses
of
his
brain
,
where
his
determination
had
thrust
*NL*
it
away
,
and
thanks
to
the
length
of
the
interval
,
the
three
weeks
'
*NL*
separation
to
which
he
had
agreed
,
it
was
with
pleasure
that
he
would
*NL*
consider
the
idea
that
he
would
see
Odette
again
on
her
return
;
but
it
*NL*
was
also
with
so
little
impatience
that
he
began
to
ask
himself
whether
*NL*
he
would
not
readily
consent
to
the
doubling
of
the
period
of
so
easy
an
*NL*
abstinence
.
It
had
lasted
,
so
far
,
but
three
days
,
a
much
shorter
time
*NL*
than
he
had
often
,
before
,
passed
without
seeing
Odette
,
and
without
*NL*
having
,
as
on
this
occasion
he
had
,
premeditated
a
separation
.
And
*NL*
yet
,
there
and
then
,
some
tiny
trace
of
contrariety
in
his
mind
,
or
*NL*
of
weakness
in
his
body
,
--
by
inciting
him
to
regard
the
present
as
an
*NL*
exceptional
moment
,
one
not
to
be
governed
by
the
rules
,
one
in
which
*NL*
prudence
itself
would
allow
him
to
take
advantage
of
the
soothing
*NL*
effects
of
a
pleasure
and
to
give
his
will
-LRB-
until
the
time
should
come
*NL*
when
its
efforts
might
serve
any
purpose
-RRB-
a
holiday
--
suspended
the
*NL*
action
of
his
will
,
which
ceased
to
exert
its
inhibitive
control
;
or
,
*NL*
without
that
even
,
the
thought
of
some
information
for
which
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
to
ask
Odette
,
such
as
if
she
had
decided
in
what
colour
she
*NL*
would
have
her
carriage
repainted
,
or
,
with
regard
to
some
investment
,
*NL*
whether
they
were
`
ordinary
'
or
`
preference
'
shares
that
she
wished
him
*NL*
to
buy
-LRB-
for
it
was
all
very
well
to
shew
her
that
he
could
live
without
*NL*
seeing
her
,
but
if
,
after
that
,
the
carriage
had
to
be
painted
over
*NL*
again
,
if
the
shares
produced
no
dividend
,
a
fine
lot
of
good
he
would
*NL*
have
done
-RRB-
,
--
and
suddenly
,
like
a
stretched
piece
of
elastic
which
is
*NL*
let
go
,
or
the
air
in
a
pneumatic
machine
which
is
ripped
open
,
the
idea
*NL*
of
seeing
her
again
,
from
the
remote
point
in
time
to
which
it
had
been
*NL*
attached
,
sprang
back
into
the
field
of
the
present
and
of
immediate
*NL*
possibilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sprang
back
thus
without
meeting
any
further
resistance
,
so
*NL*
irresistible
,
in
fact
,
that
Swann
had
been
far
less
unhappy
in
watching
*NL*
the
end
gradually
approaching
,
day
by
day
,
of
the
fortnight
which
he
*NL*
must
spend
apart
from
Odette
,
than
he
was
when
kept
waiting
ten
minutes
*NL*
while
his
coachman
brought
round
the
carriage
which
was
to
take
him
to
*NL*
her
,
minutes
which
he
passed
in
transports
of
impatience
and
joy
,
in
*NL*
which
he
recaptured
a
thousand
times
over
,
to
lavish
on
it
all
the
*NL*
wealth
of
his
affection
,
that
idea
of
his
meeting
with
Odette
,
which
,
by
*NL*
so
abrupt
a
repercussion
,
at
a
moment
when
he
supposed
it
so
remote
,
was
*NL*
once
more
present
and
on
the
very
surface
of
his
consciousness
.
The
fact
*NL*
was
that
this
idea
no
longer
found
,
as
an
obstacle
in
its
course
,
the
*NL*
desire
to
contrive
without
further
delay
to
resist
its
coming
,
which
*NL*
had
ceased
to
have
any
place
in
Swann
's
mind
since
,
having
proved
to
*NL*
himself
--
or
so
,
at
least
,
he
believed
--
that
he
was
so
easily
capable
of
*NL*
resisting
it
,
he
no
longer
saw
any
inconvenience
in
postponing
a
plan
of
*NL*
separation
which
he
was
now
certain
of
being
able
to
put
into
operation
*NL*
whenever
he
would
.
Furthermore
,
this
idea
of
seeing
her
again
came
back
*NL*
to
him
adorned
with
a
novelty
,
a
seductiveness
,
armed
with
a
virulence
,
*NL*
all
of
which
long
habit
had
enfeebled
,
but
which
had
acquired
new
vigour
*NL*
during
this
privation
,
not
of
three
days
but
of
a
fortnight
-LRB-
for
a
*NL*
period
of
abstinence
may
be
calculated
,
by
anticipation
,
as
having
*NL*
lasted
already
until
the
final
date
assigned
to
it
-RRB-
,
and
had
converted
*NL*
what
had
been
,
until
then
,
a
pleasure
in
store
,
which
could
easily
be
*NL*
sacrificed
,
into
an
unlooked-for
happiness
which
he
was
powerless
to
*NL*
resist
.
Finally
,
the
idea
returned
to
him
with
its
beauty
enhanced
by
*NL*
his
own
ignorance
of
what
Odette
might
have
thought
,
might
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
have
done
on
finding
that
he
shewed
no
sign
of
life
,
with
the
result
*NL*
that
he
was
going
now
to
meet
with
the
entrancing
revelation
of
an
*NL*
Odette
almost
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
,
just
as
she
had
supposed
that
his
refusal
to
send
her
money
was
*NL*
only
a
feint
,
saw
nothing
but
a
pretext
in
the
question
which
he
came
,
*NL*
now
,
to
ask
her
,
about
the
repainting
of
her
carriage
,
or
the
purchase
*NL*
of
stock
.
For
she
could
not
reconstruct
the
several
phases
of
these
*NL*
crises
through
which
he
passed
,
and
in
the
general
idea
which
she
formed
*NL*
of
them
she
made
no
attempt
to
understand
their
mechanism
,
looking
only
*NL*
to
what
she
knew
beforehand
,
their
necessary
,
never-failing
and
always
*NL*
identical
termination
.
An
imperfect
idea
-LRB-
though
possibly
all
the
more
*NL*
profound
in
consequence
-RRB-
,
if
one
were
to
judge
it
from
the
point
of
*NL*
view
of
Swann
,
who
would
doubtless
have
considered
that
Odette
failed
*NL*
to
understand
him
,
just
as
a
morphinomaniac
or
a
consumptive
,
each
*NL*
persuaded
that
he
has
been
thrown
back
,
one
by
some
outside
event
,
*NL*
at
the
moment
when
he
was
just
going
to
shake
himself
free
from
his
*NL*
inveterate
habit
,
the
other
by
an
accidental
indisposition
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
was
just
going
to
be
finally
cured
,
feels
himself
to
be
*NL*
misunderstood
by
the
doctor
who
does
not
attach
the
same
importance
*NL*
to
these
pretended
contingencies
,
mere
disguises
,
according
to
him
,
*NL*
assumed
,
so
as
to
be
perceptible
by
his
patients
,
by
the
vice
of
one
*NL*
and
the
morbid
state
of
the
other
,
which
in
reality
have
never
ceased
*NL*
to
weigh
heavily
and
incurably
upon
them
while
they
were
nursing
their
*NL*
dreams
of
normality
and
health
.
And
,
as
a
matter
of
fact
,
Swann
's
*NL*
love
had
reached
that
stage
at
which
the
physician
and
-LRB-
in
the
case
of
*NL*
certain
affections
-RRB-
the
boldest
of
surgeons
ask
themselves
whether
*NL*
to
deprive
a
patient
of
his
vice
or
to
rid
him
of
his
malady
is
still
*NL*
reasonable
,
or
indeed
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
,
of
the
extent
of
this
love
Swann
had
no
direct
knowledge
.
*NL*
When
he
sought
to
measure
it
,
it
happened
sometimes
that
he
found
it
*NL*
diminished
,
shrunken
almost
to
nothing
;
for
instance
,
the
very
moderate
*NL*
liking
,
amounting
almost
to
dislike
,
which
,
in
the
days
before
he
was
*NL*
in
love
with
Odette
,
he
had
felt
for
her
expressive
features
,
her
faded
*NL*
complexion
,
returned
on
certain
days
.
``
Really
,
I
am
making
distinct
*NL*
headway
,
''
he
would
tell
himself
on
the
morrow
,
``
when
I
come
to
think
it
*NL*
over
carefully
,
I
find
out
that
I
got
hardly
any
pleasure
,
last
night
,
*NL*
out
of
being
in
bed
with
her
;
it
's
an
odd
thing
,
but
I
actually
thought
*NL*
her
ugly
.
''
And
certainly
he
was
sincere
,
but
his
love
extended
a
long
*NL*
way
beyond
the
province
of
physical
desire
.
Odette
's
person
,
indeed
,
*NL*
no
longer
held
any
great
place
in
it
.
When
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
*NL*
photograph
of
Odette
on
his
table
,
or
when
she
came
to
see
him
,
he
*NL*
had
difficulty
in
identifying
her
face
,
either
in
the
flesh
or
on
the
*NL*
pasteboard
,
with
the
painful
and
continuous
anxiety
which
dwelt
in
his
*NL*
mind
.
He
would
say
to
himself
,
almost
with
astonishment
,
``
It
is
she
!
''
as
*NL*
when
suddenly
some
one
shews
us
in
a
detached
,
externalised
form
one
*NL*
of
our
own
maladies
,
and
we
find
in
it
no
resemblance
to
what
we
are
*NL*
suffering
.
``
She
?
''
--
he
tried
to
ask
himself
what
that
meant
;
for
it
*NL*
is
something
like
love
,
like
death
-LRB-
rather
than
like
those
vague
*NL*
conceptions
of
maladies
-RRB-
,
a
thing
which
one
repeatedly
calls
in
*NL*
question
,
in
order
to
make
oneself
probe
further
into
it
,
in
the
fear
*NL*
that
the
question
will
find
no
answer
,
that
the
substance
will
escape
*NL*
our
grasp
--
the
mystery
of
personality
.
And
this
malady
,
which
was
*NL*
Swann
's
love
,
had
so
far
multiplied
,
was
so
closely
interwoven
with
all
*NL*
his
habits
,
with
all
his
actions
,
with
his
thoughts
,
his
health
,
his
*NL*
sleep
,
his
life
,
even
with
what
he
hoped
for
after
his
death
,
was
so
*NL*
entirely
one
with
him
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
wrest
it
*NL*
away
without
almost
entirely
destroying
him
;
as
surgeons
say
,
his
case
*NL*
was
past
operation
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
love
Swann
had
been
so
far
detached
from
all
other
interests
*NL*
that
when
by
chance
he
reappeared
in
the
world
of
fashion
,
reminding
*NL*
himself
that
his
social
relations
,
like
a
beautifully
wrought
setting
*NL*
-LRB-
although
she
would
not
have
been
able
to
form
any
very
exact
estimate
*NL*
of
its
worth
-RRB-
,
might
,
still
,
add
a
little
to
his
own
value
in
Odette
's
*NL*
eyes
-LRB-
as
indeed
they
might
have
done
had
they
not
been
cheapened
by
his
*NL*
love
itself
,
which
for
Odette
depreciated
everything
that
it
touched
by
*NL*
seeming
to
denounce
such
things
as
less
precious
than
itself
-RRB-
,
he
would
*NL*
feel
there
,
simultaneously
with
his
distress
at
being
in
places
and
*NL*
among
people
that
she
did
not
know
,
the
same
detached
sense
of
pleasure
*NL*
as
he
would
have
derived
from
a
novel
or
a
painting
in
which
were
*NL*
depicted
the
amusements
of
a
leisured
class
;
just
as
,
at
home
,
he
used
*NL*
to
enjoy
the
thought
of
the
smooth
efficiency
of
his
household
,
the
*NL*
smartness
of
his
own
wardrobe
and
of
his
servants
'
liveries
,
the
*NL*
soundness
of
his
investments
,
with
the
same
relish
as
when
he
read
in
*NL*
Saint-Simon
,
who
was
one
of
his
favourite
authors
,
of
the
machinery
of
*NL*
daily
life
at
Versailles
,
what
Mme.
de
Maintenon
ate
and
drank
,
or
the
*NL*
shrewd
avarice
and
great
pomp
of
Lulli
.
And
in
the
small
extent
to
which
*NL*
this
detachment
was
not
absolute
,
the
reason
for
this
new
pleasure
which
*NL*
Swann
was
tasting
was
that
he
could
emigrate
for
a
moment
into
those
few
*NL*
and
distant
parts
of
himself
which
had
remained
almost
foreign
to
his
*NL*
love
and
to
his
pain
.
In
this
respect
the
personality
,
with
which
my
*NL*
great-aunt
endowed
him
,
of
`
young
Swann
,
'
as
distinct
from
the
more
*NL*
individual
personality
of
Charles
Swann
,
was
that
in
which
he
now
most
*NL*
delighted
.
Once
when
,
because
it
was
the
birthday
of
the
Princesse
de
*NL*
Parme
-LRB-
and
because
she
could
often
be
of
use
,
indirectly
,
to
Odette
,
*NL*
by
letting
her
have
seats
for
galas
and
jubilees
and
all
that
sort
of
*NL*
thing
-RRB-
,
he
had
decided
to
send
her
a
basket
of
fruit
,
and
was
not
quite
*NL*
sure
where
or
how
to
order
it
,
he
had
entrusted
the
task
to
a
cousin
of
*NL*
his
mother
who
,
delighted
to
be
doing
a
commission
for
him
,
had
written
*NL*
to
him
,
laying
stress
on
the
fact
that
she
had
not
chosen
all
the
fruit
*NL*
at
the
same
place
,
but
the
grapes
from
Crapote
,
whose
speciality
they
*NL*
were
,
the
straw
berries
from
Jauret
,
the
pears
from
Chevet
,
who
always
*NL*
had
the
best
,
am
soon
,
``
every
fruit
visited
and
examined
,
one
by
one
,
*NL*
by
myself
.
''
And
in
the
sequel
,
by
the
cordiality
with
which
the
*NL*
Princess
thanked
him
,
he
had
been
able
to
judge
of
the
flavour
of
the
*NL*
strawberries
and
of
the
ripeness
of
the
pears
.
But
,
most
of
all
,
that
*NL*
``
every
fruit
visited
and
examined
one
by
one
,
by
myself
''
had
brought
*NL*
balm
to
his
sufferings
by
carrying
his
mind
off
to
a
region
which
he
*NL*
rarely
visited
,
although
it
was
his
by
right
,
as
the
heir
of
a
rich
*NL*
and
respectable
middle-class
family
in
which
had
been
handed
down
from
*NL*
generation
to
generation
the
knowledge
of
the
`
right
places
'
and
the
art
*NL*
of
ordering
things
from
shops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
a
truth
,
he
had
too
long
forgotten
that
he
was
`
young
Swann
'
not
to
*NL*
feel
,
when
he
assumed
that
part
again
for
a
moment
,
a
keener
pleasure
*NL*
than
he
was
capable
of
feeling
at
other
times
--
when
,
indeed
,
he
was
*NL*
grown
sick
of
pleasure
;
and
if
the
friendliness
of
the
middle-class
*NL*
people
,
for
whom
he
had
never
been
anything
else
than
`
young
Swann
,
'
was
*NL*
less
animated
than
that
of
the
aristocrats
-LRB-
though
more
flattering
,
for
*NL*
all
that
,
since
in
the
middle-class
mind
friendship
is
inseparable
from
*NL*
respect
-RRB-
,
no
letter
from
a
Royal
Personage
,
offering
him
some
princely
*NL*
entertainment
,
could
ever
be
so
attractive
to
Swann
as
the
letter
which
*NL*
asked
him
to
be
a
witness
,
or
merely
to
be
present
at
a
wedding
in
the
*NL*
family
of
some
old
friends
of
his
parents
;
some
of
whom
had
`
kept
up
'
*NL*
with
him
,
like
my
grandfather
,
who
,
the
year
before
these
events
,
had
*NL*
invited
him
to
my
mother
's
wedding
,
while
others
barely
knew
him
by
*NL*
sight
,
but
were
,
they
thought
,
in
duty
bound
to
shew
civility
to
the
*NL*
son
,
to
the
worthy
successor
of
the
late
M.
Swann
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
by
virtue
of
his
intimacy
,
already
time-honoured
,
with
so
many
of
*NL*
them
,
the
people
of
fashion
,
in
a
certain
sense
,
were
also
a
part
of
his
*NL*
house
,
his
service
,
and
his
family
.
He
felt
,
when
his
mind
dwelt
upon
*NL*
his
brilliant
connections
,
the
same
external
support
,
the
same
solid
*NL*
comfort
as
when
he
looked
at
the
fine
estate
,
the
fine
silver
,
the
*NL*
fine
table-linen
which
had
come
down
to
him
from
his
forebears
.
And
the
*NL*
thought
that
,
if
he
were
seized
by
a
sudden
illness
and
confined
to
the
*NL*
house
,
the
people
whom
his
valet
would
instinctively
run
to
find
would
*NL*
be
the
Duc
de
Chartres
,
the
Prince
de
Reuss
,
the
Duc
de
Luxembourg
*NL*
and
the
Baron
de
Charlus
,
brought
him
the
same
consolation
as
our
old
*NL*
Françoise
derived
from
the
knowledge
that
she
would
,
one
day
,
be
buried
*NL*
in
her
own
fine
clothes
,
marked
with
her
name
,
not
darned
at
all
-LRB-
or
so
*NL*
exquisitely
darned
that
it
merely
enhanced
one
's
idea
of
the
skill
and
*NL*
patience
of
the
seamstress
-RRB-
,
a
shroud
from
the
constant
image
of
which
*NL*
in
her
mind
's
eye
she
drew
a
certain
satisfactory
sense
,
if
not
actually
*NL*
of
wealth
and
prosperity
,
at
any
rate
of
self-esteem
.
But
most
of
*NL*
all
,
--
since
in
every
one
of
his
actions
and
thoughts
which
had
reference
*NL*
to
Odette
,
Swann
was
constantly
subdued
and
swayed
by
the
unconfessed
*NL*
feeling
that
he
was
,
perhaps
not
less
dear
,
but
at
least
less
welcome
*NL*
to
her
than
anyone
,
even
the
most
wearisome
of
the
Verdurins
'
*NL*
`
faithful
,
'
--
when
he
betook
himself
to
a
world
in
which
he
was
the
*NL*
paramount
example
of
taste
,
a
man
whom
no
pains
were
spared
to
attract
,
*NL*
whom
people
were
genuinely
sorry
not
to
see
,
he
began
once
again
to
*NL*
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
happier
life
,
almost
to
feel
an
appetite
*NL*
for
it
,
as
an
invalid
may
feel
who
has
been
in
bed
for
months
and
on
a
*NL*
strict
diet
,
when
he
picks
up
a
newspaper
and
reads
the
account
of
an
*NL*
official
banquet
or
the
advertisement
of
a
cruise
round
Sicily
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
was
obliged
to
make
excuses
to
his
fashionable
friends
for
not
*NL*
paying
them
visits
,
it
was
precisely
for
the
visits
that
he
did
pay
her
*NL*
that
he
sought
to
excuse
himself
to
Odette
.
He
still
paid
them
-LRB-
asking
*NL*
himself
at
the
end
of
each
month
whether
,
seeing
that
he
had
perhaps
*NL*
exhausted
her
patience
,
and
had
certainly
gone
rather
often
to
see
her
,
*NL*
it
would
be
enough
if
he
sent
her
four
thousand
francs
-RRB-
,
and
for
each
*NL*
visit
he
found
a
pretext
,
a
present
that
he
had
to
bring
her
,
some
*NL*
information
which
she
required
,
M.
de
Charlus
,
whom
he
had
met
actually
*NL*
going
to
her
house
,
and
who
had
insisted
upon
Swann
's
accompanying
him
.
*NL*
And
,
failing
any
excuse
,
he
would
beg
M.
de
Charlus
to
go
to
her
*NL*
at
once
,
and
to
tell
her
,
as
though
spontaneously
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
conversation
,
that
he
had
just
remembered
something
that
he
had
to
say
*NL*
to
Swann
,
and
would
she
please
send
a
message
to
Swann
's
house
asking
*NL*
him
to
come
to
her
then
and
there
;
but
as
a
rule
Swann
waited
at
home
*NL*
in
vain
,
and
M.
de
Charlus
informed
him
,
later
in
the
evening
,
that
his
*NL*
device
had
not
proved
successful
.
With
the
result
that
,
if
she
was
now
*NL*
frequently
away
from
Paris
,
even
when
she
was
there
he
scarcely
saw
her
;
*NL*
that
she
who
,
when
she
was
in
love
with
him
,
used
to
say
,
``
I
am
always
*NL*
free
''
and
``
What
can
it
matter
to
me
,
what
other
people
think
?
''
now
,
*NL*
whenever
he
wanted
to
see
her
,
appealed
to
the
proprieties
or
pleaded
*NL*
some
engagement
.
When
he
spoke
of
going
to
a
charity
entertainment
,
or
a
*NL*
private
view
,
or
a
first-night
at
which
she
was
to
be
present
,
she
would
*NL*
expostulate
that
he
wished
to
advertise
their
relations
in
public
,
that
*NL*
he
was
treating
her
like
a
woman
off
the
streets
.
Things
came
to
such
a
*NL*
pitch
that
,
in
an
effort
to
save
himself
from
being
altogether
forbidden
*NL*
to
meet
her
anywhere
,
Swann
,
remembering
that
she
knew
and
was
deeply
*NL*
attached
to
my
great-uncle
Adolphe
,
whose
friend
he
himself
also
*NL*
had
been
,
went
one
day
to
see
him
in
his
little
flat
in
the
Rue
*NL*
de
Bellechasse
,
to
ask
him
to
use
his
influence
with
Odette
.
As
it
*NL*
happened
,
she
invariably
adopted
,
when
she
spoke
to
Swann
about
my
*NL*
uncle
,
a
poetical
tone
,
saying
:
``
Ah
,
he
!
He
is
not
in
the
least
*NL*
like
you
;
it
is
an
exquisite
thing
,
a
great
,
a
beautiful
thing
,
his
*NL*
friendship
for
me
.
He
's
not
the
sort
of
man
who
would
have
so
little
*NL*
consideration
for
me
as
to
let
himself
be
seen
with
me
everywhere
in
*NL*
public
.
''
This
was
embarrassing
for
Swann
,
who
did
not
know
quite
to
what
*NL*
rhetorical
pitch
he
should
screw
himself
up
in
speaking
of
Odette
to
my
*NL*
uncle
.
He
began
by
alluding
to
her
excellence
,
_
a
priori
_
,
the
axiom
*NL*
of
her
seraphic
super-humanity
,
the
revelation
of
her
inexpressible
*NL*
virtues
,
no
conception
of
which
could
possibly
be
formed
.
``
I
should
*NL*
like
to
speak
to
you
about
her
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
you
,
who
know
what
a
woman
*NL*
supreme
above
all
women
,
what
an
adorable
being
,
what
an
angel
Odette
*NL*
is
.
But
you
know
,
also
,
what
life
is
in
Paris
.
Everyone
does
n't
see
*NL*
Odette
in
the
light
in
which
you
and
I
have
been
Privileged
to
see
her
.
*NL*
And
so
there
are
people
who
think
that
I
am
behaving
rather
foolishly
;
*NL*
she
wo
n't
even
allow
me
to
meet
her
out
of
doors
,
at
the
theatre
.
Now
*NL*
you
,
in
whom
she
has
such
enormous
confidence
,
could
n't
you
say
a
few
*NL*
words
for
me
to
her
,
just
to
assure
her
that
she
exaggerate
the
harm
*NL*
which
my
bowing
to
her
in
the
street
might
do
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
advised
Swann
not
to
see
Odette
for
some
days
,
after
which
she
*NL*
would
love
him
all
the
more
;
he
advised
Odette
to
let
Swann
meet
her
*NL*
everywhere
,
and
as
often
as
he
pleased
.
A
few
days
later
Odette
told
*NL*
Swann
that
she
had
just
had
a
rude
awakening
;
she
had
discovered
that
*NL*
my
uncle
was
the
same
as
other
men
;
he
had
tried
to
take
her
by
assault
.
*NL*
She
calmed
Swann
,
who
,
at
first
,
was
for
rushing
out
to
challenge
my
*NL*
uncle
to
a
duel
,
but
he
refused
to
shake
hands
with
him
when
they
met
*NL*
again
.
He
regretted
this
rupture
all
the
more
because
he
had
hoped
,
if
*NL*
he
had
met
my
uncle
Adolphe
again
sometimes
and
had
contrived
to
talk
*NL*
things
over
with
him
in
strict
confidence
,
to
be
able
to
get
him
to
*NL*
throw
a
light
on
certain
rumours
with
regard
to
the
life
that
Odette
had
*NL*
led
,
in
the
old
days
,
at
Nice
.
For
my
uncle
Adolphe
used
to
spend
the
*NL*
winter
there
,
and
Swann
thought
that
it
might
indeed
have
been
there
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
that
he
had
first
known
Odette
.
The
few
words
which
some
one
*NL*
had
let
fall
,
in
his
hearing
,
about
a
man
who
,
it
appeared
,
had
been
*NL*
Odette
's
lover
,
had
left
Swann
dumbfounded
.
But
the
very
things
which
he
*NL*
would
,
before
knowing
them
,
have
regarded
as
the
most
terrible
to
*NL*
learn
and
the
most
impossible
to
believe
,
were
,
once
he
knew
them
,
*NL*
incorporated
for
all
time
in
the
general
mass
of
his
sorrow
;
he
admitted
*NL*
them
,
he
could
no
longer
have
understood
their
not
existing
.
Only
,
*NL*
each
one
of
them
in
its
passage
traced
an
indelible
line
,
altering
the
*NL*
picture
that
he
had
formed
of
his
mistress
.
At
one
time
indeed
he
felt
*NL*
that
he
could
understand
that
this
moral
`
lightness
,
'
of
which
he
would
*NL*
never
have
suspected
Odette
,
was
perfectly
well
known
,
and
that
at
Baden
*NL*
or
Nice
,
when
she
had
gone
,
in
the
past
,
to
spend
several
months
in
*NL*
one
or
the
other
place
,
she
had
enjoyed
a
sort
of
amorous
notoriety
.
*NL*
He
attempted
,
in
order
to
question
them
,
to
get
into
touch
again
with
*NL*
certain
men
of
that
stamp
;
but
these
were
aware
that
he
knew
Odette
,
*NL*
and
,
besides
,
he
was
afraid
of
putting
the
thought
of
her
into
their
*NL*
heads
,
of
setting
them
once
more
upon
her
track
.
But
he
,
to
whom
,
*NL*
up
till
then
,
nothing
could
have
seemed
so
tedious
as
was
all
that
*NL*
pertained
to
the
cosmopolitan
life
of
Baden
or
of
Nice
,
now
that
*NL*
he
learned
that
Odette
had
,
perhaps
,
led
a
`
gay
'
life
once
in
those
*NL*
pleasure-cities
,
although
he
could
never
find
out
whether
it
had
been
*NL*
solely
to
satisfy
a
want
of
money
which
,
thanks
to
himself
,
she
no
*NL*
longer
felt
,
or
from
some
capricious
instinct
which
might
,
at
any
*NL*
moment
,
revive
in
her
,
he
would
lean
,
in
impotent
anguish
,
blinded
and
*NL*
dizzy
,
over
the
bottomless
abyss
into
which
had
passed
,
in
which
had
*NL*
been
engulfed
those
years
of
his
own
,
early
in
MacMahon
's
_
Septennat
_
,
*NL*
in
which
one
spent
the
winter
on
the
Promenade
des
Anglais
,
the
summer
*NL*
beneath
the
limes
of
Baden
,
and
would
find
in
those
years
a
sad
but
*NL*
splendid
profundity
,
such
as
a
poet
might
have
lent
to
them
;
and
he
*NL*
would
have
devoted
to
the
reconstruction
of
all
the
insignificant
*NL*
details
that
made
up
the
daily
round
on
the
Côte
d'Azur
in
those
days
,
*NL*
if
it
could
have
helped
him
to
understand
something
that
still
baffled
*NL*
him
in
the
smile
or
in
the
eyes
of
Odette
,
more
enthusiasm
than
does
*NL*
the
aesthete
who
ransacks
the
extant
documents
of
fifteenth-century
*NL*
Florence
,
so
as
to
try
to
penetrate
further
into
the
soul
of
the
*NL*
Primavera
,
the
fair
Vanna
or
the
Venus
of
Botticelli
.
He
would
sit
,
*NL*
often
,
without
saying
a
word
to
her
,
only
gazing
at
her
and
dreaming
;
*NL*
and
she
would
comment
:
``
You
do
look
sad
!
''
It
was
not
very
long
since
,
*NL*
from
the
idea
that
she
was
an
excellent
creature
,
comparable
to
the
best
*NL*
women
that
he
had
known
,
he
had
passed
to
that
of
her
being
`
kept
'
;
and
*NL*
yet
already
,
by
an
inverse
process
,
he
had
returned
from
the
Odette
de
*NL*
Crécy
,
perhaps
too
well
known
to
the
holiday-makers
,
to
the
`
ladies
'
*NL*
men
'
of
Nice
and
Baden
,
to
this
face
,
the
expression
on
which
was
so
*NL*
often
gentle
,
to
this
nature
so
eminently
human
.
He
would
ask
himself
:
*NL*
``
What
does
it
mean
,
after
all
,
to
say
that
everyone
at
Nice
knows
who
*NL*
Odette
de
Crécy
is
?
Reputations
of
that
sort
,
even
when
they
're
true
,
*NL*
are
always
based
upon
other
people
's
ideas
''
;
he
would
reflect
that
this
*NL*
legend
--
even
if
it
were
authentic
--
was
something
external
to
Odette
,
*NL*
was
not
inherent
in
her
like
a
mischievous
and
ineradicable
personality
;
*NL*
that
the
creature
who
might
have
been
led
astray
was
a
woman
with
frank
*NL*
eyes
,
a
heart
full
of
pity
for
the
sufferings
of
others
,
a
docile
body
*NL*
which
he
had
pressed
tightly
in
his
arms
and
explored
with
his
fingers
,
*NL*
a
woman
of
whom
he
might
one
day
come
into
absolute
possession
if
he
*NL*
succeeded
in
making
himself
indispensable
to
her
.
There
she
was
,
*NL*
often
tired
,
her
face
left
blank
for
the
nonce
by
that
eager
,
feverish
*NL*
preoccupation
with
the
unknown
things
which
made
Swann
suffer
;
she
would
*NL*
push
back
her
hair
with
both
hands
;
her
forehead
,
her
whole
face
would
*NL*
seem
to
grow
larger
;
then
,
suddenly
,
some
ordinary
human
thought
,
some
*NL*
worthy
sentiment
such
as
is
to
be
found
in
all
creatures
when
,
in
a
*NL*
moment
of
rest
or
meditation
,
they
are
free
to
express
themselves
,
would
*NL*
flash
out
from
her
eyes
like
a
ray
of
gold
.
And
immediately
the
whole
of
*NL*
her
face
would
light
up
like
a
grey
landscape
,
swathed
in
clouds
which
,
*NL*
suddenly
,
are
swept
away
and
the
dull
scene
transfigured
,
at
the
moment
*NL*
of
the
sun
's
setting
.
The
life
which
occupied
Odette
at
such
times
,
even
*NL*
the
future
which
she
seemed
to
be
dreamily
regarding
,
Swann
could
have
*NL*
shared
with
her
.
No
evil
disturbance
seemed
to
have
left
any
effect
on
*NL*
them
.
Rare
as
they
became
,
those
moments
did
not
occur
in
vain
.
By
the
*NL*
process
of
memory
,
Swann
joined
the
fragments
together
,
abolished
the
*NL*
intervals
between
them
,
cast
,
as
in
molten
gold
,
the
image
of
an
Odette
*NL*
compact
of
kindness
and
tranquillity
,
for
whom
he
was
to
make
,
later
on
*NL*
-LRB-
as
we
shall
see
in
the
second
part
of
this
story
-RRB-
sacrifices
which
the
*NL*
other
Odette
would
never
have
won
from
him
.
But
how
rare
those
moments
*NL*
were
,
and
how
seldom
he
now
saw
her
!
Even
in
regard
to
their
evening
*NL*
meetings
,
she
would
never
tell
him
until
the
last
minute
whether
she
*NL*
would
be
able
to
see
him
,
for
,
reckoning
on
his
being
always
free
,
she
*NL*
wished
first
to
be
certain
that
no
one
else
would
offer
to
come
to
her
.
*NL*
She
would
plead
that
she
was
obliged
to
wait
for
an
answer
which
was
of
*NL*
the
very
greatest
importance
,
and
if
,
even
after
she
had
made
Swann
*NL*
come
to
her
house
,
any
of
her
friends
asked
her
,
half-way
through
the
*NL*
evening
,
to
join
them
at
some
theatre
,
or
at
supper
afterwards
,
she
*NL*
would
jump
for
joy
and
dress
herself
with
all
speed
.
As
her
toilet
*NL*
progressed
,
every
movement
that
she
made
brought
Swann
nearer
to
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
would
have
to
part
from
her
,
when
she
would
fly
off
with
*NL*
irresistible
force
;
and
when
at
length
she
was
ready
,
and
,
Plunging
into
*NL*
her
mirror
a
last
glance
strained
and
brightened
by
her
anxiety
to
look
*NL*
well
,
smeared
a
little
salve
on
her
lips
,
fixed
a
stray
loci
of
hair
*NL*
over
her
brow
,
and
called
for
her
cloak
of
sky-blue
silk
with
golden
*NL*
tassels
,
Swann
would
be
looking
so
wretched
that
she
would
be
unable
to
*NL*
restrain
a
gesture
of
impatience
as
she
flung
at
him
:
``
So
that
is
how
*NL*
you
thank
me
for
keeping
you
here
till
the
last
minute
!
And
I
thought
*NL*
I
was
being
so
nice
to
you
.
Well
,
I
shall
know
better
another
time
!
''
*NL*
Sometime
...
at
the
risk
of
annoying
her
,
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
*NL*
would
find
out
where
she
had
gone
,
and
even
dreamed
of
a
defensive
*NL*
alliance
with
Forcheville
,
who
might
perhaps
have
been
able
to
tell
him
.
*NL*
But
anyhow
,
when
he
knew
with
whom
she
was
spending
the
evening
,
it
*NL*
was
very
seldom
that
he
could
not
discover
,
among
all
his
innumerable
*NL*
acquaintance
,
some
one
who
knew
--
if
only
indirectly
--
the
man
with
*NL*
whom
she
had
gone
out
,
and
could
easily
obtain
this
or
that
piece
of
*NL*
information
about
him
.
And
while
he
was
writing
to
one
of
his
friends
,
*NL*
asking
him
to
try
to
get
a
little
light
thrown
upon
some
point
or
other
,
*NL*
he
would
feel
a
sense
of
relief
on
ceasing
to
vex
himself
with
questions
*NL*
to
which
there
was
no
answer
and
transferring
to
some
one
else
the
*NL*
strain
of
interrogation
.
It
is
true
that
Swann
was
little
the
wiser
for
*NL*
such
information
as
he
did
receive
.
To
know
a
thing
does
not
enable
us
,
*NL*
always
,
to
prevent
its
happening
,
but
after
all
the
things
that
we
know
*NL*
we
do
hold
,
if
not
in
our
hands
,
at
any
rate
in
our
minds
,
where
we
can
*NL*
dispose
of
them
as
we
choose
,
which
gives
us
the
illusion
of
a
sort
of
*NL*
power
to
control
them
.
He
was
quite
happy
whenever
M.
de
Charlus
was
*NL*
with
Odette
.
He
knew
that
between
M.
de
Charlus
and
her
nothing
untoward
*NL*
could
ever
happen
,
that
when
M.
de
Charlus
went
anywhere
with
her
,
it
*NL*
was
out
of
friendship
for
himself
,
and
that
he
would
make
no
difficulty
*NL*
about
telling
him
everything
that
she
had
done
.
Sometimes
she
had
*NL*
declared
so
emphatically
to
Swann
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
see
*NL*
her
on
a
particular
evening
,
she
seemed
to
be
looking
forward
so
keenly
*NL*
to
some
outing
,
that
Swann
attached
a
very
real
importance
to
the
fact
*NL*
that
M.
de
Charlus
was
free
to
accompany
her
.
Next
day
,
without
daring
*NL*
to
put
many
questions
to
M.
de
Charlus
,
he
would
force
him
,
by
appearing
*NL*
not
quite
to
understand
his
first
answers
,
to
give
him
more
,
after
each
*NL*
of
which
he
would
feel
himself
increasingly
relieved
,
for
he
very
*NL*
soon
learned
that
Odette
had
spent
her
evening
in
the
most
innocent
of
*NL*
dissipations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
you
mean
,
my
dear
Mémé
,
I
do
n't
quite
understand
...
You
*NL*
did
n't
go
straight
from
her
house
to
the
Musée
Grévin
?
Surely
you
went
*NL*
somewhere
else
first
?
No
?
That
is
very
odd
!
You
do
n't
know
how
amusing
*NL*
you
are
,
my
dear
Mémé
.
But
what
an
odd
idea
of
hers
to
go
on
to
the
Chat
*NL*
Noir
afterwards
;
it
was
her
idea
,
I
suppose
?
No
?
Yours
?
That
's
strange
.
*NL*
After
all
,
it
was
n't
a
bad
idea
;
she
must
have
known
dozens
of
people
*NL*
there
?
No
?
She
never
spoke
to
a
soul
?
How
extraordinary
!
Then
you
sat
*NL*
there
like
that
,
just
you
and
she
,
all
by
yourselves
?
I
can
picture
you
,
*NL*
sitting
there
!
You
are
a
worthy
fellow
,
my
dear
Mémé
;
I
'm
exceedingly
*NL*
fond
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
was
now
quite
at
ease
.
To
him
,
who
had
so
often
happened
,
when
*NL*
talking
to
friends
who
knew
nothing
of
his
love
,
friends
to
whom
he
*NL*
hardly
listened
,
to
hear
certain
detached
sentences
-LRB-
as
,
for
instance
,
*NL*
``
I
saw
Mme.
de
Crécy
yesterday
;
she
was
with
a
man
I
did
n't
know
.
''
-RRB-
,
*NL*
sentences
which
dropped
into
his
heart
and
passed
at
once
into
a
solid
*NL*
state
,
grew
hard
as
stalagmites
,
and
seared
and
tore
him
as
they
lay
*NL*
there
irremovable
,
--
how
charming
,
by
way
of
contrast
,
were
the
words
:
*NL*
``
She
did
n't
know
a
soul
;
she
never
spoke
to
a
soul
.
''
How
freely
they
*NL*
coursed
through
him
,
how
fluid
they
were
,
how
vaporous
,
how
easy
to
*NL*
breathe
!
And
yet
,
a
moment
later
,
he
was
telling
himself
that
Odette
*NL*
must
find
him
very
dull
if
those
were
the
pleasures
that
she
preferred
*NL*
to
his
company
.
And
their
very
insignificance
,
though
it
reassured
him
,
*NL*
pained
him
as
if
her
enjoyment
of
them
had
been
an
act
of
treachery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
when
he
could
not
discover
where
she
had
gone
,
it
would
have
*NL*
sufficed
to
alleviate
the
anguish
that
he
then
felt
,
for
which
Odette
's
*NL*
presence
,
the
charm
of
her
company
,
was
the
sole
specific
-LRB-
a
specific
*NL*
which
in
the
long
run
served
,
like
many
other
remedies
,
to
aggravate
the
*NL*
disease
,
but
at
least
brought
temporary
relief
to
his
sufferings
-RRB-
,
it
*NL*
would
have
sufficed
,
had
Odette
only
permitted
him
to
remain
in
her
*NL*
house
while
she
was
out
,
to
wait
there
until
that
hour
of
her
return
,
*NL*
into
whose
stillness
and
peace
would
flow
,
to
be
mingled
and
lost
there
,
*NL*
all
memory
of
those
intervening
hours
which
some
sorcery
,
some
cursed
*NL*
spell
had
made
him
imagine
as
,
somehow
,
different
from
the
rest
.
But
she
*NL*
would
not
;
he
must
return
home
;
he
forced
himself
,
on
the
way
,
to
form
*NL*
various
plans
,
ceased
to
think
of
Odette
;
he
even
reached
the
stage
,
*NL*
while
he
undressed
,
of
turning
over
all
sorts
of
happy
ideas
in
his
*NL*
mind
:
it
was
with
a
light
heart
,
buoyed
with
the
anticipation
of
going
*NL*
to
see
some
favourite
work
of
art
on
the
morrow
,
that
he
jumped
into
*NL*
bed
and
turned
out
the
light
;
but
no
sooner
had
he
made
himself
ready
*NL*
to
sleep
,
relaxing
a
self-control
of
which
he
was
not
even
conscious
,
*NL*
so
habitual
had
it
become
,
than
an
icy
shudder
convulsed
his
body
and
he
*NL*
burst
into
sobs
.
He
did
not
wish
to
know
why
,
but
dried
his
eyes
,
saying
*NL*
with
a
smile
:
``
This
is
delightful
;
I
'm
becoming
neurasthenic
.
''
After
*NL*
which
he
could
not
save
himself
from
utter
exhaustion
at
the
thought
*NL*
that
,
next
day
,
he
must
begin
afresh
his
attempt
to
find
out
what
Odette
*NL*
had
been
doing
,
must
use
all
his
influence
to
contrive
to
see
her
.
This
*NL*
compulsion
to
an
activity
without
respite
,
without
variety
,
without
*NL*
result
,
was
so
cruel
a
scourge
that
one
day
,
noticing
a
swelling
over
*NL*
his
stomach
,
he
felt
an
actual
joy
in
the
idea
that
he
had
,
perhaps
,
a
*NL*
tumour
which
would
prove
fatal
,
that
he
need
not
concern
himself
with
*NL*
anything
further
,
that
it
was
his
malady
which
was
going
to
govern
his
*NL*
life
,
to
make
a
plaything
of
him
,
until
the
not-distant
end
.
If
indeed
,
*NL*
at
this
period
,
it
often
happened
that
,
though
without
admitting
it
even
*NL*
to
himself
,
he
longed
for
death
,
it
was
in
order
to
escape
not
so
*NL*
much
from
the
keenness
of
his
sufferings
as
from
the
monotony
of
his
*NL*
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
he
would
have
wished
to
live
until
the
time
came
when
he
no
*NL*
longer
loved
her
,
when
she
would
have
no
reason
for
lying
to
him
,
when
*NL*
at
length
he
might
learn
from
her
whether
,
on
the
day
when
he
had
gone
*NL*
to
see
her
in
the
afternoon
,
she
had
or
had
not
been
in
the
arms
of
*NL*
Forcheville
.
Often
for
several
days
on
end
the
suspicion
that
she
was
*NL*
in
love
with
some
one
else
would
distract
his
mind
from
the
question
*NL*
of
Forcheville
,
making
it
almost
immaterial
to
him
,
like
those
new
*NL*
developments
of
a
continuous
state
of
ill-health
which
seem
for
a
little
*NL*
time
to
have
delivered
us
from
their
predecessors
.
There
were
even
*NL*
days
when
he
was
not
tormented
by
any
suspicion
.
He
fancied
that
he
was
*NL*
cured
.
But
next
morning
,
when
he
awoke
,
he
felt
in
the
same
place
*NL*
the
same
pain
,
a
sensation
which
,
the
day
before
,
he
had
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
diluted
in
the
torrent
of
different
impressions
.
But
it
had
not
stirred
*NL*
from
its
place
.
Indeed
,
it
was
the
sharpness
of
this
pain
that
had
*NL*
awakened
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Odette
never
gave
him
any
information
as
to
those
vastly
important
*NL*
matters
which
took
up
so
much
of
her
time
every
day
-LRB-
albeit
he
had
lived
*NL*
long
enough
in
the
world
to
know
that
such
matters
are
never
anything
*NL*
else
than
pleasures
-RRB-
he
could
not
sustain
for
any
length
of
time
the
*NL*
effort
to
imagine
them
;
his
brain
would
become
a
void
;
then
he
would
*NL*
pass
a
finger
over
his
tired
eyelids
,
in
the
same
way
as
he
might
have
*NL*
wiped
his
eyeglass
,
and
would
cease
altogether
to
think
.
There
*NL*
emerged
,
however
,
from
this
unexplored
tract
,
certain
occupations
which
*NL*
reappeared
from
time
to
time
,
vaguely
connected
by
Odette
with
some
*NL*
obligation
towards
distant
relatives
or
old
friends
who
,
inasmuch
as
*NL*
they
were
the
only
people
whom
she
was
in
the
habit
of
mentioning
*NL*
as
preventing
her
from
seeing
him
,
seemed
to
Swann
to
compose
the
*NL*
necessary
,
unalterable
setting
of
her
life
.
Because
of
the
tone
in
which
*NL*
she
referred
,
from
time
to
time
,
to
``
the
day
when
I
go
with
my
friend
*NL*
to
the
Hippodrome
,
''
if
,
when
he
felt
unwell
and
had
thought
,
``
Perhaps
*NL*
Odette
would
be
kind
and
come
to
see
me
,
''
he
remembered
,
suddenly
,
that
*NL*
it
was
one
of
those
very
days
,
he
would
correct
himself
with
an
``
Oh
,
*NL*
no
!
It
's
not
worth
while
asking
her
to
come
;
I
should
have
thought
of
it
*NL*
before
,
this
is
the
day
when
she
goes
with
her
friend
to
the
Hippodrome
.
*NL*
We
must
confine
ourselves
to
what
is
possible
;
no
use
wasting
our
time
*NL*
in
proposing
things
that
ca
n't
be
accepted
and
are
declined
in
*NL*
advance
.
''
And
this
duty
that
was
incumbent
upon
Odette
,
of
going
to
the
*NL*
Hippodrome
,
to
which
Swann
thus
gave
way
,
seemed
to
him
to
be
not
merely
*NL*
ineluctable
in
itself
;
but
the
mark
of
necessity
which
stamped
it
seemed
*NL*
to
make
plausible
and
legitimate
everything
that
was
even
remotely
*NL*
connected
with
it
.
If
,
when
Odette
,
in
the
street
,
had
acknowledged
the
*NL*
salute
of
a
passer-by
,
which
had
aroused
Swann
's
jealousy
,
she
replied
*NL*
to
his
questions
by
associating
the
stranger
with
any
of
the
two
or
*NL*
three
paramount
duties
of
which
she
had
often
spoken
to
him
;
if
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
she
said
:
``
That
's
a
gentleman
who
was
in
my
friend
's
box
the
*NL*
other
day
;
the
one
I
go
to
the
Hippodrome
with
,
''
that
explanation
would
*NL*
set
Swann
's
suspicions
at
rest
;
it
was
,
after
all
,
inevitable
that
*NL*
this
friend
should
have
other
guests
than
Odette
in
her
box
at
the
*NL*
Hippodrome
,
but
he
had
never
sought
to
form
or
succeeded
in
forming
any
*NL*
coherent
impression
of
them
.
Oh
!
how
he
would
have
loved
to
know
her
,
*NL*
that
friend
who
went
to
the
Hippodrome
,
how
he
would
have
loved
her
to
*NL*
invite
him
there
with
Odette
.
How
readily
he
would
have
sacrificed
*NL*
all
his
acquaintance
for
no
matter
what
person
who
was
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
seeing
Odette
,
were
she
but
a
manicurist
or
a
girl
out
of
a
shop
.
He
*NL*
would
have
taken
more
trouble
,
incurred
more
expense
for
them
than
for
*NL*
queens
.
Would
they
not
have
supplied
him
,
out
of
what
was
contained
in
*NL*
their
knowledge
of
the
life
of
Odette
,
with
the
one
potent
anodyne
for
*NL*
his
pain
?
With
what
joy
would
he
have
hastened
to
spend
his
days
with
*NL*
one
or
other
of
those
humble
folk
with
whom
Odette
kept
up
friendly
*NL*
relations
,
either
with
some
ulterior
motive
or
from
genuine
simplicity
*NL*
of
nature
.
How
willingly
would
he
have
fixed
his
abode
for
ever
in
the
*NL*
attics
of
some
sordid
but
enviable
house
,
where
Odette
went
but
never
*NL*
took
him
,
and
where
,
if
he
had
lived
with
the
little
retired
dressmaker
,
*NL*
whose
lover
he
would
readily
have
pretended
to
be
,
he
would
have
been
*NL*
visited
by
Odette
almost
daily
.
In
those
regions
,
that
were
almost
*NL*
slums
,
what
a
modest
existence
,
abject
,
if
you
please
,
but
delightful
,
*NL*
nourished
by
tranquillity
and
happiness
,
he
would
have
consented
to
lead
*NL*
indefinitely
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sometimes
happened
,
again
,
that
,
when
,
after
meeting
Swann
,
she
saw
*NL*
some
man
approaching
whom
he
did
not
know
,
he
could
distinguish
upon
*NL*
Odette
's
face
that
look
of
sorrow
which
she
had
worn
on
the
day
when
he
*NL*
had
come
to
her
while
Forcheville
was
there
.
But
this
was
rare
;
for
,
on
*NL*
the
days
when
,
in
spite
of
all
that
she
had
to
do
,
and
of
her
dread
*NL*
of
what
people
would
think
,
she
did
actually
manage
to
see
Swann
,
the
*NL*
predominant
quality
in
her
attitude
,
now
,
was
self-assurance
;
a
striking
*NL*
contrast
,
perhaps
an
unconscious
revenge
for
,
perhaps
a
natural
reaction
*NL*
from
the
timorous
emotion
which
,
in
the
early
days
of
their
friendship
,
*NL*
she
had
felt
in
his
presence
,
and
even
in
his
absence
,
when
she
began
a
*NL*
letter
to
him
with
the
words
:
``
My
dear
,
my
hand
trembles
so
that
I
can
*NL*
scarcely
write
.
''
-LRB-
So
,
at
least
,
she
pretended
,
and
a
little
of
that
*NL*
emotion
must
have
been
sincere
,
or
she
would
not
have
been
anxious
to
*NL*
enlarge
and
emphasise
it
.
-RRB-
So
Swann
had
been
pleasing
to
her
then
.
Our
*NL*
hands
do
not
tremble
except
for
ourselves
,
or
for
those
whom
we
love
.
*NL*
When
they
have
ceased
to
control
our
happiness
how
peaceful
,
how
easy
,
*NL*
how
bold
do
we
become
in
their
presence
!
In
speaking
to
him
,
in
writing
*NL*
to
him
now
,
she
no
longer
employed
those
words
by
which
she
had
*NL*
sought
to
give
herself
the
illusion
that
he
belonged
to
her
,
creating
*NL*
opportunities
for
saying
``
my
''
and
``
mine
''
when
she
referred
to
him
:
``
You
*NL*
are
all
that
I
have
in
the
world
;
it
is
the
perfume
of
our
friendship
,
I
*NL*
shall
keep
it
,
''
nor
spoke
to
him
of
the
future
,
of
death
itself
,
as
of
*NL*
a
single
adventure
which
they
would
have
to
share
.
In
those
early
days
,
*NL*
whatever
he
might
say
to
her
,
she
would
answer
admiringly
:
``
You
know
,
*NL*
you
will
never
be
like
other
people
!
''
--
she
would
gaze
at
his
long
,
*NL*
slightly
bald
head
,
of
which
people
who
know
only
of
his
successes
*NL*
used
to
think
:
``
He
's
not
regularly
good-looking
,
if
you
like
,
but
he
is
*NL*
smart
;
that
tuft
,
that
eyeglass
,
that
smile
!
''
and
,
with
more
curiosity
*NL*
perhaps
to
know
him
as
he
really
was
than
desire
to
become
his
mistress
,
*NL*
she
would
sigh
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
wish
I
could
find
out
what
there
is
in
that
head
of
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
now
,
whatever
he
might
say
,
she
would
answer
,
in
a
tone
sometimes
*NL*
of
irritation
,
sometimes
indulgent
:
``
Ah
!
so
you
never
will
be
like
other
*NL*
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
gaze
at
his
head
,
which
was
hardly
aged
at
all
by
his
recent
*NL*
anxieties
-LRB-
though
people
now
thought
of
it
,
by
the
same
mental
process
*NL*
which
enables
one
to
discover
the
meaning
of
a
piece
of
symphonic
music
*NL*
of
which
one
has
read
the
programme
,
or
the
`
likenesses
'
in
a
child
*NL*
whose
family
one
has
known
:
``
He
's
not
positively
ugly
,
if
you
like
,
*NL*
but
he
is
really
rather
absurd
;
that
eyeglass
,
that
tuft
,
that
smile
!
''
*NL*
realising
in
their
imagination
,
fed
by
suggestion
,
the
invisible
*NL*
boundary
which
divides
,
at
a
few
months
'
interval
,
the
head
of
an
ardent
*NL*
lover
from
a
cuckold
's
-RRB-
,
and
would
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
wish
I
could
change
you
;
put
some
sense
into
that
head
of
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Always
ready
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
what
he
hoped
,
if
it
was
only
*NL*
Odette
's
way
of
behaving
to
him
that
left
room
for
doubt
,
he
would
fling
*NL*
himself
greedily
upon
her
words
:
``
You
can
if
you
like
,
''
he
would
tell
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
tried
to
explain
to
her
that
to
comfort
him
,
to
control
him
,
to
*NL*
make
him
work
would
be
a
noble
task
,
to
which
numbers
of
other
women
*NL*
asked
for
nothing
better
than
to
be
allowed
to
devote
themselves
,
though
*NL*
it
is
only
fair
to
add
that
in
those
other
women
's
hands
the
noble
*NL*
task
would
have
seemed
to
Swann
nothing
more
than
an
indiscreet
and
*NL*
intolerable
usurpation
of
his
freedom
of
action
.
``
If
she
did
n't
love
me
,
*NL*
just
a
little
,
''
he
told
himself
,
``
she
would
not
wish
to
have
me
altered
.
*NL*
To
alter
me
,
she
will
have
to
see
me
more
often
.
''
And
so
he
was
able
to
*NL*
trace
,
in
these
faults
which
she
found
in
him
,
a
proof
at
least
of
*NL*
her
interest
,
perhaps
even
of
her
love
;
and
,
in
fact
,
she
gave
him
so
*NL*
little
,
now
,
of
the
last
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
regard
as
proofs
of
*NL*
her
interest
in
him
the
various
things
which
,
every
now
and
then
,
she
*NL*
forbade
him
to
do
.
One
day
she
announced
that
she
did
not
care
for
his
*NL*
coachman
,
who
,
she
thought
,
was
perhaps
setting
Swann
against
her
,
and
,
*NL*
anyhow
,
did
not
shew
that
promptness
and
deference
to
Swann
's
orders
*NL*
which
she
would
have
liked
to
see
.
She
felt
that
he
wanted
to
hear
her
*NL*
say
:
``
Do
n't
have
him
again
when
you
come
to
me
,
''
just
as
he
might
have
*NL*
wanted
her
to
kiss
him
.
So
,
being
in
a
good
temper
,
she
said
it
;
and
he
*NL*
was
deeply
moved
.
That
evening
,
when
talking
to
M.
de
Charlus
,
with
whom
*NL*
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
speak
of
her
openly
-LRB-
for
the
*NL*
most
trivial
remarks
that
he
uttered
now
,
even
to
people
who
had
never
*NL*
heard
of
her
,
had
always
some
sort
of
reference
to
Odette
-RRB-
,
he
said
to
*NL*
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
,
all
the
same
,
that
she
loves
me
;
she
is
so
nice
to
me
now
,
*NL*
and
she
certainly
takes
an
interest
in
what
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
,
when
he
was
starting
off
for
her
house
,
getting
into
his
*NL*
carriage
with
a
friend
whom
he
was
to
drop
somewhere
on
the
way
,
*NL*
his
friend
said
:
``
Hullo
!
that
is
n't
Loredan
on
the
box
?
''
with
what
*NL*
melancholy
joy
would
Swann
answer
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Good
heavens
,
no
!
I
can
tell
you
,
I
dare
n't
take
Loredan
when
I
*NL*
go
to
the
Rue
La
Pérouse
;
Odette
does
n't
like
me
to
have
Loredan
,
she
*NL*
thinks
he
does
n't
suit
me
.
What
on
earth
is
one
to
do
?
Women
,
you
know
,
*NL*
women
.
My
dear
fellow
,
she
would
be
furious
.
Oh
,
lord
,
yes
;
I
've
only
to
*NL*
take
Rémi
there
;
I
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
new
manners
,
indifferent
,
listless
,
irritable
,
which
Odette
now
*NL*
adopted
with
Swann
,
undoubtedly
made
him
suffer
;
but
he
did
not
realise
*NL*
how
much
he
suffered
;
since
it
had
been
with
a
regular
progression
,
day
*NL*
after
day
,
that
Odette
had
chilled
towards
him
,
it
was
only
by
directly
*NL*
contrasting
what
she
was
to-day
with
what
she
had
been
at
first
that
he
*NL*
could
have
measured
the
extent
of
the
change
that
had
taken
place
.
Now
*NL*
this
change
was
his
deep
,
his
secret
wound
,
which
pained
him
day
and
*NL*
night
,
and
whenever
he
felt
that
his
thoughts
were
straying
too
near
it
,
*NL*
he
would
quickly
turn
them
into
another
channel
for
fear
of
being
made
*NL*
to
suffer
too
keenly
.
He
might
say
to
himself
in
a
vague
way
:
``
There
*NL*
was
a
time
when
Odette
loved
me
more
,
''
but
he
never
formed
any
definite
*NL*
picture
of
that
time
.
Just
as
he
had
in
his
study
a
cupboard
at
which
he
*NL*
contrived
never
to
look
,
which
he
turned
aside
to
avoid
passing
whenever
*NL*
he
entered
or
left
the
room
,
because
in
one
of
its
drawers
he
had
locked
*NL*
away
the
chrysanthemum
which
she
had
given
him
on
one
of
those
first
*NL*
evenings
when
he
had
taken
her
home
in
his
carriage
,
and
the
letters
in
*NL*
which
she
said
:
``
Why
did
you
not
forget
your
heart
also
?
I
should
never
*NL*
have
let
you
have
that
back
,
''
and
``
At
whatever
hour
of
the
day
or
night
*NL*
you
may
need
me
,
just
send
me
a
word
,
and
dispose
of
me
as
you
please
,
''
*NL*
so
there
was
a
place
in
his
heart
to
which
he
would
never
allow
his
*NL*
thoughts
to
trespass
too
near
,
forcing
them
,
if
need
be
,
to
evade
it
by
*NL*
a
long
course
of
reasoning
so
that
they
should
not
have
to
pass
within
*NL*
reach
of
it
;
the
place
in
which
lingered
his
memories
of
happy
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
so
meticulous
prudence
was
defeated
one
evening
when
he
had
gone
*NL*
out
to
a
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
Marquise
de
Saint-Euverte
's
,
on
the
last
,
for
that
season
,
*NL*
of
the
evenings
on
which
she
invited
people
to
listen
to
the
musicians
*NL*
who
would
serve
,
later
on
,
for
her
charity
concerts
.
Swann
,
who
had
*NL*
intended
to
go
to
each
of
the
previous
evenings
in
turn
,
but
had
never
*NL*
been
able
to
make
up
his
mind
,
received
,
while
he
was
dressing
for
this
*NL*
party
,
a
visit
from
the
Baron
de
Charlus
,
who
came
with
an
offer
to
*NL*
go
with
him
to
the
Marquise
's
,
if
his
company
could
be
of
any
use
in
*NL*
helping
Swann
not
to
feel
quite
so
bored
when
he
got
there
,
to
be
a
*NL*
little
less
unhappy
.
But
Swann
had
thanked
him
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
conceive
how
glad
I
should
be
of
your
company
.
But
the
*NL*
greatest
pleasure
that
you
can
give
me
will
be
if
you
will
go
instead
*NL*
to
see
Odette
.
You
know
what
a
splendid
influence
you
have
over
her
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
suppose
she
'll
be
going
anywhere
this
evening
,
unless
she
goes
to
*NL*
see
her
old
dressmaker
,
and
I
'm
sure
she
would
be
delighted
if
you
went
*NL*
with
her
there
.
In
any
case
,
you
'll
find
her
at
home
before
then
.
Try
*NL*
to
keep
her
amused
,
and
also
to
give
her
a
little
sound
advice
.
If
you
*NL*
could
arrange
something
for
to-morrow
which
would
please
her
,
something
*NL*
that
we
could
all
three
do
together
.
Try
to
put
out
a
feeler
,
too
,
for
*NL*
the
summer
;
see
if
there
's
anything
she
wants
to
do
,
a
cruise
that
we
*NL*
might
all
three
take
;
anything
you
can
think
of
.
I
do
n't
count
upon
*NL*
seeing
her
to-night
,
myself
;
still
if
she
would
like
me
to
come
,
or
*NL*
if
you
find
a
loophole
,
you
've
only
to
send
me
a
line
at
Mme.
de
*NL*
Saint-Euverte
's
up
till
midnight
;
after
that
I
shall
be
here
.
Ever
so
*NL*
many
thanks
for
all
you
are
doing
for
me
--
you
know
what
I
feel
about
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
friend
promised
to
go
and
do
as
Swann
wished
as
soon
as
he
had
*NL*
deposited
him
at
the
door
of
the
Saint-Euverte
house
,
where
he
arrived
*NL*
soothed
by
the
thought
that
M.
de
Charlus
would
be
spending
the
evening
*NL*
in
the
Rue
La
Pérouse
,
but
in
a
state
of
melancholy
indifference
to
*NL*
everything
that
did
not
involve
Odette
,
and
in
particular
to
the
details
*NL*
of
fashionable
life
,
a
state
which
invested
them
with
the
charm
that
is
*NL*
to
be
found
in
anything
which
,
being
no
longer
an
object
of
our
desire
,
*NL*
appears
to
us
in
its
own
guise
.
On
alighting
from
his
carriage
,
in
the
*NL*
foreground
of
that
fictitious
summary
of
their
domestic
existence
which
*NL*
hostesses
are
pleased
to
offer
to
their
guests
on
ceremonial
occasions
,
*NL*
and
in
which
they
shew
a
great
regard
for
accuracy
of
costume
and
*NL*
setting
,
Swann
was
amused
to
discover
the
heirs
and
successors
of
*NL*
Balzac
's
`
tigers
'
--
now
`
grooms
'
--
.
who
normally
followed
their
mistress
*NL*
when
she
walked
abroad
,
but
now
,
hatted
and
booted
,
were
posted
out
*NL*
of
doors
,
in
front
of
the
house
on
the
gravelled
drive
,
or
outside
the
*NL*
stables
,
as
gardeners
might
be
drawn
up
for
inspection
at
the
ends
of
*NL*
their
several
flower-beds
.
The
peculiar
tendency
which
he
had
always
*NL*
had
to
look
for
analogies
between
living
people
and
the
portraits
*NL*
in
galleries
reasserted
itself
here
,
but
in
a
more
positive
and
more
*NL*
general
form
;
it
was
society
as
a
whole
,
now
that
he
was
detached
*NL*
from
it
,
which
presented
itself
to
him
in
a
series
of
pictures
.
In
the
*NL*
cloak-room
,
into
which
,
in
the
old
days
,
when
he
was
still
a
man
of
*NL*
fashion
,
he
would
have
gone
in
his
overcoat
,
to
emerge
from
it
in
*NL*
evening
dress
,
but
without
any
impression
of
what
had
occurred
there
,
*NL*
his
mind
having
been
,
during
the
minute
or
two
that
he
had
spent
in
*NL*
it
,
either
still
at
the
party
which
he
had
just
left
,
or
already
at
the
*NL*
party
into
which
he
was
just
about
to
be
ushered
,
he
now
noticed
,
for
*NL*
the
first
time
,
roused
by
the
unexpected
arrival
of
so
belated
a
guest
,
*NL*
the
scattered
pack
of
splendid
effortless
animals
,
the
enormous
footmen
*NL*
who
were
drowsing
here
and
there
upon
benches
and
chests
,
until
,
*NL*
pointing
their
noble
greyhound
profiles
,
they
towered
upon
their
feet
*NL*
and
gathered
in
a
circle
round
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
,
of
a
particularly
ferocious
aspect
,
and
not
unlike
the
*NL*
headsman
in
certain
Renaissance
pictures
which
represent
executions
,
*NL*
tortures
,
and
the
like
,
advanced
upon
him
with
an
implacable
air
to
take
*NL*
his
`
things
.
'
But
the
harshness
of
his
steely
glare
was
compensated
by
*NL*
the
softness
of
his
cotton
gloves
,
so
effectively
that
,
as
he
approached
*NL*
Swann
,
he
seemed
to
be
exhibiting
at
once
an
utter
contempt
for
his
*NL*
person
and
the
most
tender
regard
for
his
hat
.
He
took
it
with
a
care
to
*NL*
which
the
precision
of
his
movements
imparted
something
that
was
almost
*NL*
over-fastidious
,
and
with
a
delicacy
that
was
rendered
almost
touching
*NL*
by
the
evidence
of
his
splendid
strength
.
Then
he
passed
it
to
one
of
*NL*
his
satellites
,
a
novice
and
timid
,
who
was
expressing
the
panic
that
*NL*
overpowered
him
by
casting
furious
glances
in
every
direction
,
and
*NL*
displayed
all
the
dumb
agitation
of
a
wild
animal
in
the
first
hours
of
*NL*
its
captivity
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
feet
away
,
a
strapping
great
lad
in
livery
stood
musing
,
*NL*
motionless
,
statuesque
,
useless
,
like
that
purely
decorative
warrior
*NL*
whom
one
sees
in
the
most
tumultuous
of
Mantegna
's
paintings
,
lost
in
*NL*
dreams
,
leaning
upon
his
shield
,
while
all
around
him
are
fighting
and
*NL*
bloodshed
and
death
;
detached
from
the
group
of
his
companions
who
were
*NL*
thronging
about
Swann
,
he
seemed
as
determined
to
remain
unconcerned
in
*NL*
the
scene
,
which
he
followed
vaguely
with
his
cruel
,
greenish
eyes
,
as
*NL*
if
it
had
been
the
Massacre
of
the
Innocents
or
the
Martyrdom
of
Saint
*NL*
James
.
He
seemed
precisely
to
have
sprung
from
that
vanished
race
--
if
,
*NL*
indeed
,
it
ever
existed
,
save
in
the
reredos
of
San
Zeno
and
the
*NL*
frescoes
of
the
Eremitani
,
where
Swann
had
come
in
contact
with
it
,
and
*NL*
where
it
still
dreams
--
fruit
of
the
impregnation
of
a
classical
statue
*NL*
by
some
one
of
the
Master
's
Paduan
models
,
or
of
Albert
Duerer
's
Saxons
.
*NL*
And
the
locks
of
his
reddish
hair
,
crinkled
by
nature
,
but
glued
to
his
*NL*
head
by
brilliantine
,
were
treated
broadly
as
they
are
in
that
Greek
*NL*
sculpture
which
the
Mantuan
painter
never
ceased
to
study
,
and
which
,
*NL*
if
in
its
creator
's
purpose
it
represents
but
man
,
manages
at
least
to
*NL*
extract
from
man
's
simple
outlines
such
a
variety
of
richness
,
borrowed
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
from
the
whole
of
animated
nature
,
that
a
head
of
hair
,
*NL*
by
the
glossy
undulation
and
beak-like
points
of
its
curls
,
or
in
the
*NL*
overlaying
of
the
florid
triple
diadem
of
its
brushed
tresses
,
can
*NL*
suggest
at
once
a
bunch
of
seaweed
,
a
brood
of
fledgling
doves
,
a
bed
of
*NL*
hyacinths
and
a
serpent
's
writhing
back
.
Others
again
,
no
less
colossal
,
*NL*
were
disposed
upon
the
steps
of
a
monumental
staircase
which
,
by
their
*NL*
decorative
presence
and
marmorean
immobility
,
was
made
worthy
to
be
*NL*
named
,
like
that
god-crowned
ascent
in
the
Palace
of
the
Doges
,
the
*NL*
`
Staircase
of
the
Giants
,
'
and
on
which
Swann
now
set
foot
,
saddened
by
*NL*
the
thought
that
Odette
had
never
climbed
it
.
Ah
,
with
what
joy
would
*NL*
he
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
raced
up
the
dark
,
evil-smelling
,
breakneck
*NL*
flights
to
the
little
dressmaker
's
,
in
whose
attic
he
would
so
gladly
*NL*
have
paid
the
price
of
a
weekly
stage-box
at
the
Opera
for
the
right
to
*NL*
spend
the
evening
there
when
Odette
came
,
and
other
days
too
,
for
the
*NL*
privilege
of
talking
about
her
,
of
living
among
people
whom
she
was
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
seeing
when
he
was
not
there
,
and
who
,
on
that
account
,
*NL*
seemed
to
keep
secret
among
themselves
some
part
of
the
life
of
his
*NL*
mistress
more
real
,
more
inaccessible
and
more
mysterious
than
anything
*NL*
that
he
knew
.
Whereas
upon
that
pestilential
,
enviable
staircase
to
*NL*
the
old
dressmaker
's
,
since
there
was
no
other
,
no
service
stair
in
the
*NL*
building
,
one
saw
in
the
evening
outside
every
door
an
empty
,
unwashed
*NL*
milk-can
set
out
,
in
readiness
for
the
morning
round
,
upon
the
door-mat
;
*NL*
on
the
despicable
,
enormous
staircase
which
Swann
was
at
that
moment
*NL*
climbing
,
on
either
side
of
him
,
at
different
levels
,
before
each
*NL*
anfractuosity
made
in
its
walls
by
the
window
of
the
porter
's
lodge
or
*NL*
the
entrance
to
a
set
of
rooms
,
representing
the
departments
of
indoor
*NL*
service
which
they
controlled
,
and
doing
homage
for
them
to
the
guests
,
*NL*
a
gate-keeper
,
a
major-domo
,
a
steward
-LRB-
worthy
men
who
spent
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
week
in
semi-independence
in
their
own
domains
,
dined
there
by
*NL*
themselves
like
small
shopkeepers
,
and
might
to-morrow
lapse
to
the
*NL*
plebeian
service
of
some
successful
doctor
or
industrial
magnate
-RRB-
,
*NL*
scrupulous
in
carrying
out
to
the
letter
all
the
instructions
that
had
*NL*
been
heaped
upon
them
before
they
were
allowed
to
don
the
brilliant
*NL*
livery
which
they
wore
only
at
long
intervals
,
and
in
which
they
did
not
*NL*
feel
altogether
at
their
ease
,
stood
each
in
the
arcade
of
his
doorway
,
*NL*
their
splendid
pomp
tempered
by
a
democratic
good-fellowship
,
like
*NL*
saints
in
their
niches
,
and
a
gigantic
usher
,
dressed
Swiss
Guard
*NL*
fashion
,
like
the
beadle
in
a
church
,
struck
the
pavement
with
his
staff
*NL*
as
each
fresh
arrival
passed
him
.
Coming
to
the
top
of
the
staircase
,
up
*NL*
which
he
had
been
followed
by
a
servant
with
a
pallid
countenance
and
*NL*
a
small
pigtail
clubbed
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
like
one
of
Goya
's
*NL*
sacristans
or
a
tabellion
in
an
old
play
,
Swann
passed
by
an
office
in
*NL*
which
the
lackeys
,
seated
like
notaries
before
their
massive
registers
,
*NL*
rose
solemnly
to
their
feet
and
inscribed
his
name
.
He
next
crossed
a
*NL*
little
hall
which
--
just
as
certain
rooms
are
arranged
by
their
owners
*NL*
to
serve
as
the
setting
for
a
single
work
of
art
-LRB-
from
which
they
*NL*
take
their
name
-RRB-
,
and
,
in
their
studied
bareness
,
contain
nothing
else
*NL*
besides
--
displayed
to
him
as
he
entered
it
,
like
some
priceless
effigy
*NL*
by
Benvenuto
Cellini
of
an
armed
watchman
,
a
young
footman
,
his
body
*NL*
slightly
bent
forward
,
rearing
above
his
crimson
gorget
an
even
more
*NL*
crimson
face
,
from
which
seemed
to
burst
forth
torrents
of
fire
,
*NL*
timidity
and
zeal
,
who
,
as
he
pierced
the
Aubusson
tapestries
that
*NL*
screened
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
the
music
was
being
given
with
*NL*
his
impetuous
,
vigilant
,
desperate
gaze
,
appeared
,
with
a
soldierly
*NL*
impassibility
or
a
supernatural
faith
--
an
allegory
of
alarums
,
*NL*
incarnation
of
alertness
,
commemoration
of
a
riot
--
to
be
looking
out
,
*NL*
angel
or
sentinel
,
from
the
tower
of
dungeon
or
cathedral
,
for
the
*NL*
approach
of
the
enemy
or
for
the
hour
of
Judgment
.
Swann
had
now
only
to
*NL*
enter
the
concert-room
,
the
doors
of
which
were
thrown
open
to
him
by
an
*NL*
usher
loaded
with
chains
,
who
bowed
low
before
him
as
though
tendering
*NL*
to
him
the
keys
of
a
conquered
city
.
But
he
thought
of
the
house
*NL*
in
which
at
that
very
moment
he
might
have
been
,
if
Odette
had
but
*NL*
permitted
,
and
the
remembered
glimpse
of
an
empty
milk-can
upon
a
*NL*
door-mat
wrung
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
speedily
recovered
his
sense
of
the
general
ugliness
of
the
human
*NL*
male
when
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
tapestry
curtain
,
the
spectacle
of
*NL*
the
servants
gave
place
to
that
of
the
guests
.
But
even
this
ugliness
of
*NL*
faces
,
which
of
course
were
mostly
familiar
to
him
,
seemed
something
new
*NL*
and
uncanny
,
now
that
their
features
,
--
instead
of
being
to
him
symbols
*NL*
of
practical
utility
in
the
identification
of
this
or
that
man
,
who
*NL*
until
then
had
represented
merely
so
many
pleasures
to
be
sought
after
,
*NL*
boredoms
to
be
avoided
,
or
courtesies
to
be
acknowledged
--
were
at
rest
,
*NL*
measurable
by
aesthetic
co-ordinates
alone
,
in
the
autonomy
of
their
*NL*
curves
and
angles
.
And
in
these
men
,
in
the
thick
of
whom
Swann
now
*NL*
found
himself
packed
,
there
was
nothing
-LRB-
even
to
the
monocle
which
many
*NL*
of
them
wore
,
and
which
,
previously
,
would
,
at
the
most
,
have
enabled
*NL*
Swann
to
say
that
so-and-so
wore
a
monocle
-RRB-
which
,
no
longer
restricted
*NL*
to
the
general
connotation
of
a
habit
,
the
same
in
all
of
them
,
did
not
*NL*
now
strike
him
with
a
sense
of
individuality
in
each
.
Perhaps
because
*NL*
he
did
not
regard
General
de
Froberville
and
the
Marquis
de
Bréaute
,
who
*NL*
were
talking
together
just
inside
the
door
,
as
anything
more
than
two
*NL*
figures
in
a
picture
,
whereas
they
were
the
old
and
useful
friends
who
*NL*
had
put
him
up
for
the
Jockey
Club
and
had
supported
him
in
duels
,
the
*NL*
General
's
monocle
,
stuck
like
a
shell-splinter
in
his
common
,
scarred
,
*NL*
victorious
,
overbearing
face
,
in
the
middle
of
a
forehead
which
it
*NL*
left
half-blinded
,
like
the
single-eyed
flashing
front
of
the
Cyclops
,
*NL*
appeared
to
Swann
as
a
monstrous
wound
which
it
might
have
been
glorious
*NL*
to
receive
but
which
it
was
certainly
not
decent
to
expose
,
while
*NL*
that
which
M.
de
Bréaute
wore
,
as
a
festive
badge
,
with
his
pearl-grey
*NL*
gloves
,
his
crush
hat
and
white
tie
,
substituting
it
for
the
familiar
*NL*
pair
of
glasses
-LRB-
as
Swann
himself
did
-RRB-
when
he
went
out
to
places
,
bore
,
*NL*
glued
to
its
other
side
,
like
a
specimen
prepared
on
a
slide
for
the
*NL*
microscope
,
an
infinitesimal
gaze
that
swarmed
with
friendly
feeling
and
*NL*
never
ceased
to
twinkle
at
the
loftiness
of
ceilings
,
the
delightfulness
*NL*
of
parties
,
the
interestingness
of
programmes
and
the
excellence
of
*NL*
refreshments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
!
you
here
!
why
,
it
's
ages
since
I
've
seen
you
,
''
the
General
*NL*
greeted
Swann
and
,
noticing
the
look
of
strain
on
his
face
and
*NL*
concluding
that
it
was
perhaps
a
serious
illness
that
had
kept
him
away
,
*NL*
went
on
,
``
You
're
looking
well
,
old
man
!
''
while
M.
de
Bréauté
turned
*NL*
with
,
``
My
dear
fellow
,
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
?
''
to
a
`
society
*NL*
novelist
'
who
had
just
fitted
into
the
angle
of
eyebrow
and
cheek
his
*NL*
own
monocle
,
the
sole
instrument
that
he
used
in
his
psychological
*NL*
investigations
and
remorseless
analyses
of
character
,
and
who
now
*NL*
replied
,
with
an
air
of
mystery
and
importance
,
rolling
the
`
r
'
:
--
``
I
am
*NL*
observing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Marquis
de
Forestelle
's
monocle
was
minute
and
rimless
,
and
,
by
*NL*
enforcing
an
incessant
and
painful
contraction
of
the
eye
over
which
it
*NL*
was
incrusted
like
a
superfluous
cartilage
,
the
presence
of
which
there
*NL*
was
inexplicable
and
its
substance
unimaginable
,
it
gave
to
his
face
a
*NL*
melancholy
refinement
,
and
led
women
to
suppose
him
capable
of
suffering
*NL*
terribly
when
in
love
.
But
that
of
M.
de
Saint-Candé
,
girdled
,
like
*NL*
Saturn
,
with
an
enormous
ring
,
was
the
centre
of
gravity
of
a
face
which
*NL*
composed
itself
afresh
every
moment
in
relation
to
the
glass
,
while
*NL*
his
thrusting
red
nose
and
swollen
sarcastic
lips
endeavoured
by
their
*NL*
grimaces
to
rise
to
the
level
of
the
steady
flame
of
wit
that
sparkled
*NL*
in
the
polished
disk
,
and
saw
itself
preferred
to
the
most
ravishing
*NL*
eyes
in
the
world
by
the
smart
,
depraved
young
women
whom
it
set
*NL*
dreaming
of
artificial
charms
and
a
refinement
of
sensual
bliss
;
and
*NL*
then
,
behind
him
,
M.
de
Palancy
,
who
with
his
huge
carp
's
head
and
*NL*
goggling
eyes
moved
slowly
up
and
down
the
stream
of
festive
gatherings
,
*NL*
unlocking
his
great
mandibles
at
every
moment
as
though
in
search
of
*NL*
his
orientation
,
had
the
air
of
carrying
about
upon
his
person
only
an
*NL*
accidental
and
perhaps
purely
symbolical
fragment
of
the
glass
wall
of
*NL*
his
aquarium
,
a
part
intended
to
suggest
the
whole
which
recalled
to
*NL*
Swann
,
a
fervent
admirer
of
Giotto
's
Vices
and
Virtues
at
Padua
,
that
*NL*
Injustice
by
whose
side
a
leafy
bough
evokes
the
idea
of
the
forests
*NL*
that
enshroud
his
secret
lair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
had
gone
forward
into
the
room
,
under
pressure
from
Mme.
de
*NL*
Saint-Euverte
and
in
order
to
listen
to
an
aria
from
_
Orfeo
_
which
was
*NL*
being
rendered
on
the
flute
,
and
had
taken
up
a
position
in
a
corner
*NL*
from
which
,
unfortunately
,
his
horizon
was
bounded
by
two
ladies
of
*NL*
`
uncertain
'
age
,
seated
side
by
side
,
the
Marquise
de
Cambremer
and
the
*NL*
Vicomtesse
de
Franquetot
,
who
,
because
they
were
cousins
,
used
to
spend
*NL*
their
time
at
parties
in
wandering
through
the
rooms
,
each
clutching
her
*NL*
bag
and
followed
by
her
daughter
,
hunting
for
one
another
like
people
at
*NL*
a
railway
station
,
and
could
never
be
at
rest
until
they
had
reserved
,
*NL*
by
marking
them
with
their
fans
or
handkerchiefs
,
two
adjacent
chairs
;
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cambremer
,
since
she
knew
scarcely
anyone
,
being
all
the
more
*NL*
glad
of
a
companion
,
while
Mme.
de
Franquetot
,
who
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
was
extremely
popular
,
thought
it
effective
and
original
to
shew
all
*NL*
her
fine
friends
that
she
preferred
to
their
company
that
of
an
obscure
*NL*
country
cousin
with
whom
she
had
childish
memories
in
common
.
Filled
*NL*
with
ironical
melancholy
,
Swann
watched
them
as
they
listened
to
the
*NL*
pianoforte
intermezzo
-LRB-
Liszt
's
`
Saint
Francis
preaching
to
the
birds
'
-RRB-
*NL*
which
came
after
the
flute
,
and
followed
the
virtuoso
in
his
dizzy
*NL*
flight
;
Mme.
de
Franquetot
anxiously
,
her
eyes
starting
from
her
head
,
*NL*
as
though
the
keys
over
which
his
fingers
skipped
with
such
agility
were
*NL*
a
series
of
trapezes
,
from
any
one
of
which
he
might
come
crashing
,
*NL*
a
hundred
feet
,
to
the
ground
,
stealing
now
and
then
a
glance
of
*NL*
astonishment
and
unbelief
at
her
companion
,
as
who
should
say
:
``
It
is
n't
*NL*
possible
,
I
would
never
have
believed
that
a
human
being
could
do
all
*NL*
that
!
''
;
Mme.
de
Cambremer
,
as
a
woman
who
had
received
a
sound
musical
*NL*
education
,
beating
time
with
her
head
--
transformed
for
the
nonce
into
*NL*
the
pendulum
of
a
metronome
,
the
sweep
and
rapidity
of
whose
movements
*NL*
from
one
shoulder
to
the
other
-LRB-
performed
with
that
look
of
wild
*NL*
abandonment
in
her
eye
which
a
sufferer
shews
who
is
no
longer
able
to
*NL*
analyse
his
pain
,
nor
anxious
to
master
it
,
and
says
merely
``
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
it
''
-RRB-
so
increased
that
at
every
moment
her
diamond
earrings
caught
*NL*
in
the
trimming
of
her
bodice
,
and
she
was
obliged
to
put
straight
the
*NL*
bunch
of
black
grapes
which
she
had
in
her
hair
,
though
without
any
*NL*
interruption
of
her
constantly
accelerated
motion
.
On
the
other
side
*NL*
-LRB-
and
a
little
way
in
front
-RRB-
of
Mme.
de
Franquetot
,
was
the
Marquise
de
*NL*
Gallardon
,
absorbed
in
her
favourite
meditation
,
namely
upon
her
own
*NL*
kinship
with
the
Guermantes
family
,
from
which
she
derived
both
publicly
*NL*
and
in
private
a
good
deal
of
glory
not
unmingled
with
shame
,
the
most
*NL*
brilliant
ornaments
of
that
house
remaining
somewhat
aloof
from
her
,
*NL*
perhaps
because
she
was
just
a
tiresome
old
woman
,
or
because
she
was
a
*NL*
scandalous
old
woman
,
or
because
she
came
of
an
inferior
branch
of
the
*NL*
family
,
or
very
possibly
for
no
reason
at
all
.
When
she
found
herself
*NL*
seated
next
to
some
one
whom
she
did
not
know
,
as
she
was
at
this
moment
*NL*
next
to
Mme.
de
Franquetot
,
she
suffered
acutely
from
the
feeling
that
*NL*
her
own
consciousness
of
her
Guermantes
connection
could
not
be
made
*NL*
externally
manifest
in
visible
character
like
those
which
,
in
the
*NL*
mosaics
in
Byzantine
churches
,
placed
one
beneath
another
,
inscribe
in
a
*NL*
vertical
column
by
the
side
of
some
Sacred
Personage
the
words
which
he
*NL*
is
supposed
to
be
uttering
.
At
this
moment
she
was
pondering
the
fact
*NL*
that
she
had
never
received
an
invitation
,
or
even
call
,
from
her
young
*NL*
cousin
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
during
the
six
years
that
had
already
*NL*
elapsed
since
the
latter
's
marriage
.
The
thought
filled
her
with
*NL*
anger
--
and
with
pride
;
for
,
by
virtue
of
having
told
everyone
who
*NL*
expressed
surprise
at
never
seeing
her
at
Mme.
des
Laumes
's
,
that
it
*NL*
was
because
of
the
risk
of
meeting
the
Princesse
Mathilde
there
--
a
*NL*
degradation
which
her
own
family
,
the
truest
and
bluest
of
Legitimists
,
*NL*
would
never
have
forgiven
her
,
she
had
come
gradually
to
believe
that
*NL*
this
actually
was
the
reason
for
her
not
visiting
her
young
cousin
.
She
*NL*
remembered
,
it
is
true
,
that
she
had
several
times
inquired
of
Mme.
des
*NL*
Laumes
how
they
might
contrive
to
meet
,
but
she
remembered
it
only
in
*NL*
a
confused
way
,
and
besides
did
more
than
neutralise
this
slightly
*NL*
humiliating
reminiscence
by
murmuring
,
``
After
all
,
it
is
n't
for
me
to
*NL*
take
the
first
step
;
I
am
at
least
twenty
years
older
than
she
is
.
''
And
*NL*
fortified
by
these
unspoken
words
she
flung
her
shoulders
proudly
back
*NL*
until
they
seemed
to
part
company
with
her
bust
,
while
her
head
,
which
*NL*
lay
almost
horizontally
upon
them
,
made
one
think
of
the
`
stuck-on
'
head
*NL*
of
a
pheasant
which
is
brought
to
the
table
regally
adorned
with
its
*NL*
feathers
.
Not
that
she
in
the
least
degree
resembled
a
pheasant
,
having
*NL*
been
endowed
by
nature
with
a
short
and
squat
and
masculine
figure
;
but
*NL*
successive
mortifications
had
given
her
a
backward
tilt
,
such
as
one
may
*NL*
observe
in
trees
which
have
taken
root
on
the
very
edge
of
a
precipice
*NL*
and
are
forced
to
grow
backwards
to
preserve
their
balance
.
Since
she
*NL*
was
obliged
,
in
order
to
console
herself
for
not
being
quite
on
a
level
*NL*
with
the
rest
of
the
Guermantes
,
to
repeat
to
herself
incessantly
that
*NL*
it
was
owing
to
the
uncompromising
rigidity
of
her
principles
and
pride
*NL*
that
she
saw
so
little
of
them
,
the
constant
iteration
had
gradually
*NL*
remoulded
her
body
,
and
had
given
her
a
sort
of
`
bearing
'
which
was
*NL*
accepted
by
the
plebeian
as
a
sign
of
breeding
,
and
even
kindled
,
at
*NL*
times
,
a
momentary
spark
in
the
jaded
eyes
of
old
gentlemen
in
clubs
.
*NL*
Had
anyone
subjected
Mme.
de
Gallardon
's
conversation
to
that
form
of
*NL*
analysis
which
by
noting
the
relative
frequency
of
its
several
terms
*NL*
would
furnish
him
with
the
key
to
a
ciphered
message
,
he
would
at
*NL*
once
have
remarked
that
no
expression
,
not
even
the
commonest
forms
*NL*
of
speech
,
occurred
in
it
nearly
so
often
as
``
at
my
cousins
the
*NL*
Guermantes
's
,
''
``
at
my
aunt
Guermantes
's
,
''
``
Elzéar
de
Guermantes
's
*NL*
health
,
''
``
my
cousin
Guermantes
's
box
.
''
If
anyone
spoke
to
her
of
a
*NL*
distinguished
personage
,
she
would
reply
that
,
although
she
was
not
*NL*
personally
acquainted
with
him
,
she
had
seen
him
hundreds
of
times
at
*NL*
her
aunt
Guermantes
's
,
but
she
would
utter
this
reply
in
so
icy
a
tone
,
*NL*
with
such
a
hollow
sound
,
that
it
was
at
once
quite
clear
that
if
*NL*
she
did
not
know
the
celebrity
personally
that
was
because
of
all
the
*NL*
obstinate
,
ineradicable
principles
against
which
her
arching
shoulders
*NL*
were
stretched
back
to
rest
,
as
on
one
of
those
ladders
on
which
*NL*
gymnastic
instructors
make
us
`
extend
'
so
as
to
develop
the
expansion
of
*NL*
our
chests
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
who
had
not
been
expected
to
*NL*
appear
at
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
that
evening
,
did
in
fact
arrive
.
To
*NL*
shew
that
she
did
not
wish
any
special
attention
,
in
a
house
to
which
*NL*
she
had
come
by
an
act
of
condescension
,
to
be
paid
to
her
superior
*NL*
rank
,
she
had
entered
the
room
with
her
arms
pressed
close
to
her
sides
,
*NL*
even
when
there
was
no
crowd
to
be
squeezed
through
,
no
one
attempting
*NL*
to
get
past
her
;
staying
purposely
at
the
back
,
with
the
air
of
being
*NL*
in
her
proper
place
,
like
a
king
who
stands
in
the
waiting
procession
at
*NL*
the
doors
of
a
theatre
where
the
management
have
not
been
warned
of
his
*NL*
coming
;
and
strictly
limiting
her
field
of
vision
--
so
as
not
to
seem
to
*NL*
be
advertising
her
presence
and
claiming
the
consideration
that
was
her
*NL*
due
--
to
the
study
of
a
pattern
in
the
carpet
or
of
her
own
skirt
,
she
*NL*
stood
there
on
the
spot
which
had
struck
her
as
the
most
modest
-LRB-
and
*NL*
from
which
,
as
she
very
well
knew
,
a
cry
of
rapture
from
Mme.
de
*NL*
Saint-Euverte
would
extricate
her
as
soon
as
her
presence
there
was
*NL*
noticed
-RRB-
,
next
to
Mme.
de
Cambremer
,
whom
,
however
,
she
did
not
know
.
*NL*
She
observed
the
dumb-show
by
which
her
neighbour
was
expressing
her
*NL*
passion
for
music
,
but
she
refrained
from
copying
it
.
This
was
not
to
*NL*
say
that
,
for
once
that
she
had
consented
to
spend
a
few
minutes
in
Mme.
*NL*
de
Saint-Euverte
's
house
,
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
would
not
have
wished
*NL*
-LRB-
so
that
the
act
of
politeness
to
her
hostess
which
she
had
performed
by
*NL*
coming
might
,
so
to
speak
,
`
count
double
'
-RRB-
to
shew
herself
as
friendly
*NL*
and
obliging
as
possible
.
But
she
had
a
natural
horror
of
what
she
*NL*
called
`
exaggerating
,
'
and
always
made
a
point
of
letting
people
see
*NL*
that
she
`
simply
must
not
'
indulge
in
any
display
of
emotion
that
was
*NL*
not
in
keeping
with
the
tone
of
the
circle
in
which
she
moved
,
although
*NL*
such
displays
never
failed
to
make
an
impression
upon
her
,
by
virtue
of
*NL*
that
spirit
of
imitation
,
akin
to
timidity
,
which
is
developed
in
the
*NL*
most
self-confident
persons
,
by
contact
with
an
unfamiliar
environment
,
*NL*
even
though
it
be
inferior
to
their
own
.
She
began
to
ask
herself
*NL*
whether
these
gesticulations
might
not
,
perhaps
,
be
a
necessary
*NL*
concomitant
of
the
piece
of
music
that
was
being
played
,
a
piece
which
,
*NL*
it
might
be
,
was
in
a
different
category
from
all
the
music
that
she
had
*NL*
ever
heard
before
;
and
whether
to
abstain
from
them
was
not
a
sign
of
*NL*
her
own
inability
to
understand
the
music
,
and
of
discourtesy
towards
*NL*
the
lady
of
the
house
;
with
the
result
that
,
in
order
to
express
by
a
*NL*
compromise
both
of
her
contradictory
inclinations
in
turn
,
at
one
moment
*NL*
she
would
merely
straighten
her
shoulder-straps
or
feel
in
her
golden
*NL*
hair
for
the
little
balls
of
coral
or
of
pink
enamel
,
frosted
with
tiny
*NL*
diamonds
,
which
formed
its
simple
but
effective
ornament
,
studying
,
with
*NL*
a
cold
interest
,
her
impassioned
neighbour
,
while
at
another
she
would
*NL*
beat
time
for
a
few
bars
with
her
fan
,
but
,
so
as
not
to
forfeit
her
*NL*
independence
,
she
would
beat
a
different
time
from
the
pianist
's
.
When
*NL*
he
had
finished
the
Liszt
Intermezzo
and
had
begun
a
Prelude
by
Chopin
,
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cambremer
turned
to
Mme.
de
Franquetot
with
a
tender
smile
,
*NL*
full
of
intimate
reminiscence
,
as
well
as
of
satisfaction
-LRB-
that
of
*NL*
a
competent
judge
-RRB-
with
the
performance
.
She
had
been
taught
in
her
*NL*
girlhood
to
fondle
and
cherish
those
long-necked
,
sinuous
creatures
,
*NL*
the
phrases
of
Chopin
,
so
free
,
so
flexible
,
so
tactile
,
which
begin
by
*NL*
seeking
their
ultimate
resting-place
somewhere
beyond
and
far
wide
of
*NL*
the
direction
in
which
they
started
,
the
point
which
one
might
have
*NL*
expected
them
to
reach
,
phrases
which
divert
themselves
in
those
*NL*
fantastic
bypaths
only
to
return
more
deliberately
--
with
a
more
*NL*
premeditated
reaction
,
with
more
precision
,
as
on
a
crystal
bowl
which
,
*NL*
if
you
strike
it
,
will
ring
and
throb
until
you
cry
aloud
in
anguish
--
to
*NL*
clutch
at
one
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brought
up
in
a
provincial
household
with
few
friends
or
visitors
,
*NL*
hardly
ever
invited
to
a
ball
,
she
had
fuddled
her
mind
,
in
the
solitude
*NL*
of
her
old
manor-house
,
over
setting
the
pace
,
now
crawling-slow
,
now
*NL*
passionate
,
whirling
,
breathless
,
for
all
those
imaginary
waltzing
*NL*
couples
,
gathering
them
like
flowers
,
leaving
the
ball-room
for
a
moment
*NL*
to
listen
,
where
the
wind
sighed
among
the
pine-trees
,
on
the
shore
of
*NL*
the
lake
,
and
seeing
of
a
sudden
advancing
towards
her
,
more
different
*NL*
from
anything
one
had
ever
dreamed
of
than
earthly
lovers
are
,
a
slender
*NL*
young
man
,
whose
voice
was
resonant
and
strange
and
false
,
in
white
*NL*
gloves
.
But
nowadays
the
old-fashioned
beauty
of
this
music
seemed
*NL*
to
have
become
a
trifle
stale
.
Having
forfeited
,
some
years
back
,
the
*NL*
esteem
of
`
really
musical
'
people
,
it
had
lost
its
distinction
and
its
*NL*
charm
,
and
even
those
whose
taste
was
frankly
bad
had
ceased
to
find
in
*NL*
it
more
than
a
moderate
pleasure
to
which
they
hardly
liked
to
confess
.
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cambremer
cast
a
furtive
glance
behind
her
.
She
knew
that
her
*NL*
young
daughter-in-law
-LRB-
full
of
respect
for
her
new
and
noble
family
,
*NL*
except
in
such
matters
as
related
to
the
intellect
,
upon
which
,
having
*NL*
`
got
as
far
'
as
Harmony
and
the
Greek
alphabet
,
she
was
specially
*NL*
enlightened
-RRB-
despised
Chopin
,
and
fell
quite
ill
when
she
heard
him
*NL*
played
.
But
finding
herself
free
from
the
scrutiny
of
this
Wagnerian
,
*NL*
who
was
sitting
,
at
some
distance
,
in
a
group
of
her
own
contemporaries
,
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cambremer
let
herself
drift
upon
a
stream
of
exquisite
memories
*NL*
and
sensations
.
The
Princesse
des
Laumes
was
touched
also
.
Though
*NL*
without
any
natural
gift
for
music
,
she
had
received
,
some
fifteen
*NL*
years
earlier
,
the
instruction
which
a
music-mistress
of
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Germain
,
a
woman
of
genius
who
had
been
,
towards
the
end
of
*NL*
her
life
,
reduced
to
penury
,
had
started
,
at
seventy
,
to
give
to
the
*NL*
daughters
and
granddaughters
of
her
old
pupils
.
This
lady
was
now
dead
.
*NL*
But
her
method
,
an
echo
of
her
charming
touch
,
came
to
life
now
and
*NL*
then
in
the
fingers
of
her
pupils
,
even
of
those
who
had
been
in
other
*NL*
respects
quite
mediocre
,
had
given
up
music
,
and
hardly
ever
opened
a
*NL*
piano
.
And
so
Mme.
des
Laumes
could
let
her
head
sway
to
and
fro
,
fully
*NL*
aware
of
the
cause
,
with
a
perfect
appreciation
of
the
manner
in
which
*NL*
the
pianist
was
rendering
this
Prelude
,
since
she
knew
it
by
heart
.
The
*NL*
closing
notes
of
the
phrase
that
he
had
begun
sounded
already
on
her
*NL*
lips
.
And
she
murmured
``
How
charming
it
is
!
''
with
a
stress
on
the
*NL*
opening
consonants
of
the
adjective
,
a
token
of
her
refinement
by
which
*NL*
she
felt
her
lips
so
romantically
compressed
,
like
the
petals
of
a
*NL*
beautiful
,
budding
flower
,
that
she
instinctively
brought
her
eyes
into
*NL*
harmony
,
illuminating
them
for
a
moment
with
a
vague
and
sentimental
*NL*
gaze
.
Meanwhile
Mme.
de
Gallardon
had
arrived
at
the
point
of
saying
to
*NL*
herself
how
annoying
it
was
that
she
had
so
few
opportunities
of
meeting
*NL*
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
for
she
meant
to
teach
her
a
lesson
by
not
*NL*
acknowledging
her
bow
.
She
did
not
know
that
her
cousin
was
in
the
room
.
*NL*
A
movement
of
Mme.
Franquetot
's
head
disclosed
the
Princess
.
At
once
*NL*
Mme.
de
Gallardon
dashed
towards
her
,
upsetting
all
her
neighbours
;
*NL*
although
determined
to
preserve
a
distant
and
glacial
manner
which
*NL*
should
remind
everyone
present
that
she
had
no
desire
to
remain
on
*NL*
friendly
terms
with
a
person
in
whose
house
one
might
find
oneself
,
any
*NL*
day
,
cheek
by
jowl
with
the
Princesse
Mathilde
,
and
to
whom
it
was
not
*NL*
her
duty
to
make
advances
since
she
was
not
`
of
her
generation
,
'
*NL*
she
felt
bound
to
modify
this
air
of
dignity
and
reserve
by
some
*NL*
non-committal
remark
which
would
justify
her
overture
and
would
force
*NL*
the
Princess
to
engage
in
conversation
;
and
so
,
when
she
reached
her
*NL*
cousin
,
Mme.
de
Gallardon
,
with
a
stern
countenance
and
one
hand
thrust
*NL*
out
as
though
she
were
trying
to
`
force
'
a
card
,
began
with
:
``
How
is
*NL*
your
husband
?
''
in
the
same
anxious
tone
that
she
would
have
used
if
the
*NL*
Prince
had
been
seriously
ill
.
The
Princess
,
breaking
into
a
laugh
which
*NL*
was
one
of
her
characteristics
,
and
was
intended
at
once
to
shew
the
*NL*
rest
of
an
assembly
that
she
was
making
fun
of
some
one
and
also
to
*NL*
enhance
her
own
beauty
by
concentrating
her
features
around
her
animated
*NL*
lips
and
sparkling
eyes
,
answered
:
``
Why
;
he
's
never
been
better
in
his
*NL*
life
!
''
And
she
went
on
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
de
Gallardon
then
drew
herself
up
and
,
chilling
her
expression
*NL*
still
further
,
perhaps
because
she
was
still
uneasy
about
the
Prince
's
*NL*
health
,
said
to
her
cousin
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oriane
,
''
-LRB-
at
once
Mme.
des
Laumes
looked
with
amused
astonishment
*NL*
towards
an
invisible
third
,
whom
she
seemed
to
call
to
witness
that
she
*NL*
had
never
authorised
Mme.
de
Gallardon
to
use
her
Christian
name
-RRB-
``
I
*NL*
should
be
so
pleased
if
you
would
look
in
,
just
for
a
minute
,
to-morrow
*NL*
evening
,
to
hear
a
quintet
,
with
the
clarinet
,
by
Mozart
.
I
should
like
*NL*
to
have
your
opinion
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
not
so
much
to
be
issuing
an
invitation
as
to
be
asking
*NL*
favour
,
and
to
want
the
Princess
's
opinion
of
the
Mozart
quintet
just
*NL*
though
it
had
been
a
dish
invented
by
a
new
cook
,
whose
talent
it
was
*NL*
most
important
that
an
epicure
should
come
to
judge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
know
that
quintet
quite
well
.
I
can
tell
you
now
--
that
I
adore
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
my
husband
is
n't
at
all
well
;
it
's
his
liver
.
He
would
like
*NL*
so
much
to
see
you
,
''
Mme.
de
Gallardon
resumed
,
making
it
now
a
corporal
*NL*
work
of
charity
for
the
Princess
to
appear
at
her
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Princess
never
liked
to
tell
people
that
she
would
not
go
to
their
*NL*
houses
.
Every
day
she
would
write
to
express
her
regret
at
having
*NL*
been
kept
away
--
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
her
husband
's
mother
,
by
an
*NL*
invitation
from
his
brother
,
by
the
Opera
,
by
some
excursion
to
the
*NL*
country
--
from
some
party
to
which
she
had
never
for
a
moment
dreamed
of
*NL*
going
.
In
this
way
she
gave
many
people
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
that
*NL*
she
was
on
intimate
terms
with
them
,
that
she
would
gladly
have
come
to
*NL*
their
houses
,
and
that
she
had
been
prevented
from
doing
so
only
by
some
*NL*
princely
occurrence
which
they
were
flattered
to
find
competing
with
*NL*
their
own
humble
entertainment
.
And
then
,
as
she
belonged
to
that
*NL*
witty
`
Guermantes
set
'
--
in
which
there
survived
something
of
the
*NL*
alert
mentality
,
stripped
of
all
commonplace
phrases
and
conventional
*NL*
sentiments
,
which
dated
from
Mérimée
,
and
found
its
final
expression
in
*NL*
the
plays
of
Meilhac
and
Halévy
--
she
adapted
its
formula
so
as
to
suit
*NL*
even
her
social
engagements
,
transposed
it
into
the
courtesy
which
was
*NL*
always
struggling
to
be
positive
and
precise
,
to
approximate
itself
to
*NL*
the
plain
truth
.
She
would
never
develop
at
any
length
to
a
hostess
the
*NL*
expression
of
her
anxiety
to
be
present
at
her
party
;
she
found
it
more
*NL*
pleasant
to
disclose
to
her
all
the
various
little
incidents
on
which
it
*NL*
would
depend
whether
it
was
or
was
not
possible
for
her
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
and
I
'll
explain
,
''
she
began
to
Mme.
de
Gallardon
.
``
To-morrow
*NL*
evening
I
must
go
to
a
friend
of
mine
,
who
has
been
pestering
me
to
fix
*NL*
a
day
for
ages

If
she
takes
us
to
the
theatre
afterwards
,
then
I
ca
n't
*NL*
possibly
come
to
you
,
much
as
I
should
love
to
;
but
if
we
just
stay
in
*NL*
the
house

I

there

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell

you
seen
your

M.

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
never

Where

I

catch
his
eye

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
funny
thing
that
he
should
come

Saint-Euverte

Mme.
de

Gallardon
went
on
.
``
Oh

I
know
he
's
very
clever

meaning
by
that
`
very
*NL*
cunning
,
'
``
but
that
makes
no
difference

fancy
a
Jew
here

and
she
the

sister-in-law

two
Archbishops

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
ashamed
to
confess
that
I
am
not

the

Princesse

all
that

his

But
they
do
say
that
the
converted
ones
are
*NL*
worse
about
their
religion
than
the
practising
ones
,
that
it
's
all
just
*NL*
a
pretence
;
is
that
true

*NL*
``

*NL*
The
pianist
,
who
was
`
down
'
to
play
two
pieces
by
Chopin
,
after
*NL*
finishing
the
Prelude
had
at
once
attacked
a
Polonaise
.
But
once
Mme.
*NL*
de
Gallardon
had
informed
her
cousin
that
Swann
was
in
the
room
,
Chopin
*NL*
himself
might
have
risen
from
the
grave
and
played
all
his
works
in
*NL*
turn
without
Mme.
des
Laumes
's
paying
him
the
slightest
attention
.
She
*NL*
belonged
to
that
one
of
the
two
divisions
of
the
human
race
in
which
the
*NL*
untiring
curiosity
which
the
other
half
feels
about
the
people
whom
it
*NL*
does
not
know
is
replaced
by
an
unfailing
interest
in
the
people
whom
it
*NL*
does
.
As
with
many
women
of
the
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
,
the
presence
,
in
*NL*
any
room
in
which
she
might
find
herself
,
of
another
member
of
her
set
,
*NL*
even
although
she
had
nothing
in
particular
to
say
to
him
,
would
occupy
*NL*
her
mind
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
consideration
.
From
that
*NL*
moment
,
in
the
hope
that
Swann
would
catch
sight
of
her
,
the
Princess
*NL*
could
do
nothing
but
-LRB-
like
a
tame
white
mouse
when
a
lump
of
sugar
is
*NL*
put
down
before
its
nose
and
then
taken
away
-RRB-
turn
her
face
,
in
which
*NL*
were
crowded
a
thousand
signs
of
intimate
connivance
,
none
of
them
with
*NL*
the
least
relevance
to
the
sentiment
underlying
Chopin
's
music
,
in
the
*NL*
direction
where
Swann
was
,
and
,
if
he
moved
,
divert
accordingly
the
*NL*
course
of
her
magnetic
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oriane
,
do
n't
be
angry
with
me
,
''
resumed
Mme.
de
Gallardon
,
who
could
*NL*
never
restrain
herself
from
sacrificing
her
highest
social
ambitions
,
*NL*
and
the
hope
that
she
might
one
day
emerge
into
a
light
that
would
*NL*
dazzle
the
world
,
to
the
immediate
and
secret
satisfaction
of
saying
*NL*
something
disagreeable
,
``
people
do
say
about
your
M.
Swann
that
he
's
the
*NL*
sort
of
man
one
ca
n't
have
in
the
house
;
is
that
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
,
of
all
people
,
ought
to
know
that
it
's
true
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
``
for
you
must
have
asked
him
a
hundred
times
,
and
*NL*
he
's
never
been

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
leaving
her
cousin
mortified
afresh
,
she
broke
out
again
into
a
*NL*
laugh
which
scandalised
everyone
who
was
trying
to
listen
to
the
music
,
*NL*
but
attracted
the
attention
of
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
,
who
had
stayed
,
*NL*
out
of
politeness
,
near
the
piano
,
and
caught
sight
of
the
Princess
now
*NL*
for
the
first
time
.
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
was
all
the
more
delighted
*NL*
to
see
Mme.
des
Laumes
,
as
she
imagined
her
to
be
still
at
Guermantes
,
*NL*
looking
after
her
father-in-law
,
who
was
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Princess
,
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
tucked
myself
away
in
a
corner
,
and
I
've
been
hearing
such
*NL*
lovely
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
you
've
been
in
the
room
quite
a
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
quite
a
long
time
,
which
seemed
very
short
;
it
was
only
long
*NL*
because
I
could
n't
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
offered
her
own
chair
to
the
Princess
,
who
*NL*
declined
it
with
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
,
no
!
Why
should
you
?
It
does
n't
matter
in
the
least
where
*NL*
I
sit
.
''
And
deliberately
picking
out
,
so
as
the
better
to
display
the
*NL*
simplicity
of
a
really
great
lady
,
a
low
seat
without
a
back
:
``
There
*NL*
now
,
that
hassock
,
that
's
all
I
want
.
It
will
make
me
keep
my
back
*NL*
straight
.
Oh
!
Good
heavens
,
I
'm
making
a
noise
again
;
they
'll
be
telling
*NL*
you
to
have
me
`
chucked
out
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
pianist
having
doubled
his
speed
,
the
emotion
of
the
*NL*
music-lovers
was
reaching
its
climax
,
a
servant
was
handing
refreshments
*NL*
about
on
a
salver
,
and
was
making
the
spoons
rattle
,
and
,
as
on
every
*NL*
other
`
party-night
'
,
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
was
making
signs
to
him
,
*NL*
which
he
never
saw
,
to
leave
the
room
.
A
recent
bride
,
who
had
been
told
*NL*
that
a
young
woman
ought
never
to
appear
bored
,
was
smiling
vigorously
,
*NL*
trying
to
catch
her
hostess
's
eye
so
as
to
flash
a
token
of
her
*NL*
gratitude
for
the
other
's
having
`
thought
of
her
'
in
connection
with
so
*NL*
delightful
an
entertainment
.
And
yet
,
although
she
remained
more
calm
*NL*
than
Mme.
de
Franquetot
,
it
was
not
without
some
uneasiness
that
she
*NL*
followed
the
flying
fingers
;
what
alarmed
her
being
not
the
pianist
's
*NL*
fate
but
the
piano
's
,
on
which
a
lighted
candle
,
jumping
at
each
*NL*
_
fortissimo
_
,
threatened
,
if
not
to
set
its
shade
on
fire
,
at
least
to
*NL*
spill
wax
upon
the
ebony
.
At
last
she
could
contain
herself
no
longer
,
*NL*
and
,
running
up
the
two
steps
of
the
platform
on
which
the
piano
stood
,
*NL*
flung
herself
on
the
candle
to
adjust
its
sconce
.
But
scarcely
had
her
*NL*
hand
come
within
reach
of
it
when
,
on
a
final
chord
,
the
piece
finished
,
*NL*
and
the
pianist
rose
to
his
feet
.
Nevertheless
the
bold
initiative
shewn
*NL*
by
this
young
woman
and
the
moment
of
blushing
confusion
between
her
*NL*
and
the
pianist
which
resulted
from
it
,
produced
an
impression
that
was
*NL*
favourable
on
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
what
that
girl
did
just
now
,
Princess
?
''
asked
General
de
*NL*
Froberville
,
who
had
come
up
to
Mme.
des
Laumes
as
her
hostess
left
her
*NL*
for
a
moment
.
``
Odd
,
was
n't
it
?
Is
she
one
of
the
performers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
's
a
little
Mme.
de
Cambremer
,
''
replied
the
Princess
carelessly
,
*NL*
and
then
,
with
more
animation
:
``
I
am
only
repeating
what
I
heard
just
*NL*
now
,
myself
;
I
have
n't
the
faintest
notion
who
said
it
,
it
was
some
one
*NL*
behind
me
who
said
that
they
were
neighbours
of
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
in
*NL*
the
country
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
anyone
knows
them
,
really
.
They
must
be
*NL*
`
country
cousins
'
!
By
the
way
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
're
particularly
*NL*
`
well-up
'
in
the
brilliant
society
which
we
see
before
us
,
because
I
've
*NL*
no
idea
who
all
these
astonishing
people
can
be
.
What
do
you
suppose
*NL*
they
do
with
themselves
when
they
're
not
at
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
*NL*
parties
?
She
must
have
ordered
them
in
with
the
musicians
and
the
chairs
*NL*
and
the
food
.
`
Universal
providers
,
'
you
know
.
You
must
admit
,
they
're
*NL*
rather
splendid
,
General
.
But
can
she
really
have
the
courage
to
hire
*NL*
the
same
`
supers
'
every
week
?
It
is
n't
possible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
Cambremer
is
quite
a
good
name
;
old
,
too
,
''
protested
the
*NL*
General
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
no
objection
to
its
being
old
,
''
the
Princess
answered
dryly
,
``
but
*NL*
whatever
else
it
is
it
's
not
euphonious
,
''
she
went
on
,
isolating
the
*NL*
word
euphonious
as
though
between
inverted
commas
,
a
little
affectation
*NL*
to
which
the
Guermantes
set
were
addicted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
not
,
eh
!
She
's
a
regular
little
peach
,
though

''
said
the
*NL*
General
,
whose
eyes
never
strayed
from
Mme.
de
Cambremer
.
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
agree
with
me
,
Princess
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
thrusts
herself
forward
too
much
;
I
think
,
in
so
young
a
woman
,
*NL*
that
's
not
very
nice
--
for
I
do
n't
suppose
she
's
my
generation
,
''
replied
*NL*
Mme.
des
Laumes
-LRB-
the
last
word
being
common
,
it
appeared
,
to
Gallardon
*NL*
and
Guermantes
-RRB-
.
And
then
,
seeing
that
M.
de
Froberville
was
still
*NL*
gazing
at
Mme.
de
Cambremer
,
she
added
,
half
out
of
malice
towards
the
*NL*
lady
,
half
wishing
to
oblige
the
General
:
``
Not
very
nice
...
for
her
*NL*
husband
!
I
am
sorry
that
I
do
not
know
her
,
since
she
seems
to
attract
*NL*
you
so
much
;
I
might
have
introduced
you
to
her
,
''
said
the
Princess
,
*NL*
who
,
if
she
had
known
the
young
woman
,
would
most
probably
have
done
*NL*
nothing
of
the
sort
.
``
And
now
I
must
say
good
night
,
because
one
of
*NL*
my
friends
is
having
a
birthday
party
,
and
I
must
go
and
wish
her
many
*NL*
happy
returns
,
''
she
explained
,
modestly
and
with
truth
,
reducing
the
*NL*
fashionable
gathering
to
which
she
was
going
to
the
simple
proportions
*NL*
of
a
ceremony
which
would
be
boring
in
the
extreme
,
but
at
which
she
was
*NL*
obliged
to
be
present
,
and
there
would
be
something
touching
about
her
*NL*
appearance
.
``
Besides
,
I
must
pick
up
Basin
.
While
I
've
been
here
,
he
's
*NL*
gone
to
see
those
friends
of
his
--
you
know
them
too
,
I
'm
sure
,
--
who
are
*NL*
called
after
a
bridge

oh

yes

the
Iénas

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
battle
before
it
was
a
bridge

Princess
;
it
was
a
victory
!

*NL*
said
the
General
.
``
I
mean
to
say
,
to
an
old
soldier
like
me
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
,
wiping
his
monocle
and
replacing
it
,
as
though
he
were
laying
*NL*
a
fresh
dressing
on
the
raw
wound
underneath
,
while
the
Princess
*NL*
instinctively
looked
away
,
``
that
Empire
nobility
,
well
,
of
course
,
it
's
*NL*
not
the
same
thing
,
but
,
after
all
,
taking
it
as
it
is
,
it
's
very
fine
*NL*
of
its
kind
;
they
were
people
who
really
did
fight
like
heroes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
the
deepest
respect
for
heroes
,
''
the
Princess
assented
,
*NL*
though
with
a
faint
trace
of
irony
.
``
If
I
do
n't
go
with
Basin
to
see
*NL*
this
Princesse
d'Iéna
,
it
is
n't
for
that
,
at
all
;
it
's
simply
because
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
them
.
Basin
knows
them
;
he
worships
them
.
Oh
,
no
,
it
's
not
*NL*
what
you
think
;
he
's
not
in
love
with
her
.
I
've
nothing
to
set
my
face
*NL*
against
!
Besides
,
what
good
has
it
ever
done
when
I
have
set
my
face
*NL*
against
them
?
''
she
queried
sadly
,
for
the
whole
world
knew
that
,
*NL*
ever
since
the
day
upon
which
the
Prince
des
Laumes
had
married
his
*NL*
fascinating
cousin
,
he
had
been
consistently
unfaithful
to
her
.
``
Anyhow
,
*NL*
it
is
n't
that
at
all

has
known
for
ever
so
long
,
they
*NL*
do
him
very
well
,
and
that
suits
me
down
to
the
ground
.
But
I
must
tell
*NL*
you
what
he
's
told
me
about
their
house
;
it
's
quite
enough
.
Can
you
*NL*
imagine
it
,
all
their
furniture
is
'Em
pire
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
Princess
,
that
's
only
natural
;
it
belonged
to
their
*NL*
grandparents

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
say
it
did
n't
,

that
does
n't
make
it
any
less
ugly

I
*NL*
quite
understand
that
people
ca
n't
always
have
nice
things
,
but
at
least
*NL*
they
need
n't
have
things
that
are
merely
grotesque
.
What
do
you
say
?
*NL*
I
can
think
of
nothing
more
devastating
,
more
utterly
smug
than
that
*NL*
hideous
style

cabinets
covered
all
over
with
swans

heads

like

bath-taps

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
believe

all
the

that
they

got
some
lovely
things

why

*NL*
they
must
have
that
famous
mosaic
table
on

*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
deny
,
they
may
have
things
that
are
interesting
enough
*NL*
from
the
historic
point
of
view
.
But
things
like
that
ca
n't
,
ever
,
be
*NL*
beautiful
...
because
they
're
simply
horrible
!
I
've
got
things
like
that
*NL*
myself
,
that
came
to
Basin
from
the
Montesquious
.
Only
,
they
're
up
in
*NL*
the
attics
at
Guermantes
,
where
nobody
ever
sees
them
.
But
,
after
all
,
*NL*
that
's
not
the
point

I
would
fly
to
see
them

with
Basin

I
would
even
*NL*
go
to
see
them
among
all
their
sphinxes
and
brasses
,
if
I
knew
them
,
*NL*

--
I
do
n't
know
them

D'you
know
,
I
was
always
taught
,
when
I
was
a

little
girl
,
that
it
was
not
polite
to
call
on
people

did

*NL*
She
assumed
a
tone
of
childish
gravity
.
``
And
so
I
am
just
doing
what
*NL*
I
was

to
do

Ca

you
see
those
good
people

with
a
totally
*NL*
strange
woman
bursting
into
their
house

Why
,
I
might
get
a
most
hostile
*NL*
reception

*NL*
*NL*
And
she
coquettishly
enhanced
the
charm
of
the
smile
which
the
idea
had
*NL*
brought
to
her
lips
,
by
giving
to
her
blue
eyes
,
which
were
fixed
on
the
*NL*
General
,
a
gentle
,
dreamy
expression
.

*NL*
``
My

Princess

you
know
that
they

be
simply
wild
with
joy

``
No

why

''
she
inquired
,
with
the
utmost
vivacity
,
either
so
as
to
seem
*NL*
unaware
that
it
would
be
because
she
was
one
of
the
first
ladies
in
*NL*
France
,
or
so
as
to
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
General
tell
*NL*
her
so
.
``
Why
?
How
can
you
tell
?
Perhaps
they
would
think
it
the
most
*NL*
unpleasant
thing
that
could
possibly
happen
.
I
know
nothing
about
them
,
*NL*
but
if
they
're
anything
like
me
,
I
find
it
quite
boring
enough
to
see
*NL*
the
people
I
do
know

I
'm
sure
if
I
had
to
see
people
I
did

as
well

even
if
they
had

I
should
go
stark

Besides
,
except
when
it
's
an
old
friend

you

whom
one
knows
quite
*NL*
apart
from
that
,
I
'm
not
sure
that
`
heroism
'
takes
one
very
far
in
*NL*
society

It
's
often
quite
boring
enough
to
have
to
give
a
dinner-party
,
*NL*
but
if
one
had
to
offer
one
's
arm
to
Spartacus
,
to
let
him
take
one
*NL*
down
...
!
Really
,
no
;
it
would
never
be
Vercingetorix
I
should
send
for
,
*NL*
to
make
a
fourteenth
.
I
feel
sure
,
I
should
keep
him
for
really
big
*NL*
`
crushes

And
as
I
never
give
any

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Princess
,
it
's
easy
to
see
you
're
not
a
Guermantes
for
nothing
.
You
*NL*
have
your
share
of
it
,
all
right

the
`
wit
of
the
Guermantes

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
people
always
talk
about
the
wit

I
never

make
out
why

you
really
know
any
others
who
have
it

''
she
rallied
*NL*
him
,
with
a
rippling
flow
of
laughter
,
her
features
concentrated
,
yoked
*NL*
to
the
service
of
her
animation
,
her
eyes
sparkling
,
blazing
with
*NL*
a
radiant
sunshine
of
gaiety
which
could
be
kindled
only
by
such
*NL*
speeches
--
even
if
the
Princess
had
to
make
them
herself

as
were
in

praise
of
her
wit

of
her
beauty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
notice
how
dreadfully
ill

looking

asked
the

*NL*
*NL*
Swann
was
extremely
fond
of
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
and
the
sight
of
*NL*
her
recalled
to
him
Guermantes
,
a
property
close
to
Combray
,
and
all
*NL*
that
country
which
he
so
dearly
loved
and
had
ceased
to
visit
,
so
as
not
*NL*
to
be
separated
from
Odette
.
Slipping
into
the
manner
,
half-artistic
,
*NL*
half-amorous
--
with
which
he
could
always
manage
to
amuse
the
Princess
--
a
*NL*
manner
which
came
to
him
quite
naturally
whenever
he
dipped
for
a
moment
*NL*
into
the
old
social
atmosphere
,
and
wishing
also
to
express
in
words
,
*NL*
for
his
own
satisfaction
,
the
longing
that
he
felt
for
the
country
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
or
rather
intoned
,
in
such
a
way
as
to
be
audible
at
*NL*
once
to
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
,
to
whom
he
spoke
,
and
to
Mme.
des
Laumes
,
*NL*
for
whom
he
was
speaking
,
``
Behold
our
charming
Princess

See
,
she
has

come
up
on
purpose
from
Guermantes
to
hear
Saint
Francis
preach
to
the
*NL*
birds
,
and
has
only
just
had
time
,
like
a
dear
little
tit-mouse
,
to
go
*NL*
and
pick
a
few
little
hips
and
haws
and
put
them
in
her
hair
;
there
are
*NL*
even
some
drops
of
dew
upon
them
still

a
little
of
the
hoar-frost

must
be
making
the

down
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
The
Princess
came
up
on
purpose
from
Guermantes

But
that
's
too
*NL*
wonderful
!

never
knew
;
I
'm
quite
bewildered

Mme.

Saint-Euverte
*NL*
protested
with
quaint
simplicity
,
being
but
little
accustomed
to
Swann
's
*NL*
way
of
speaking

And
then
,
examining
the
Princess
's
headdress
,
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
're
quite
right
;
it
is
copied
from
...
what
shall
I
say
,
not
*NL*
chestnuts
,
no
,
--
oh
,
it
's
a
delightful
idea
,
but
how
can
the
Princess
*NL*
have
known
what
was
going
to
be
on
my
programme
?
The
musicians
did
n't
*NL*
tell
me
,
even
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
,
who
was
accustomed
,
when
he
was
with
a
woman
whom
he
had
kept
*NL*
up
the
habit
of
addressing
in
terms
of
gallantry
,
to
pay
her
delicate
*NL*
compliments
which
most
other
people
would
not
and
need
not
understand
,
*NL*
did
not
condescend
to
explain
to
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
that
he
had
*NL*
been
speaking
metaphorically
.
As
for
the
Princess
,
she
was
in
fits
of
*NL*
laughter
,
both
because
Swann
's
wit
was
highly
appreciated
by
her
set
,
*NL*
and
because
she
could
never
hear
a
compliment
addressed
to
herself
*NL*
without
finding
it
exquisitely
subtle
and
irresistibly
amusing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
I
'm
delighted
,
Charles
,
if
my
little
hips
and
haws
meet
with

your
approval

But
tell
me
,
why
did
you
bow
to
that
Cambremer
person

are
you
also
her
neighbour
in
the
country
?

*NL*
*NL*
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
,
seeing
that
the
Princess
seemed
quite
happy
*NL*
talking
to
Swann
,
had
drifted
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
are

yourself

Princess

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Why
,
they
must
have
`
countries

everywhere

those
creatures

wish
I
had
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
the
Cambremers
;
her
own
people
.
She
was
a
Legrandin
,
and
used
*NL*
to
come
to
Combray
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
are
aware
that
you
are
*NL*
Comtesse
de
Combray
,

that
the
Chapter
owes
you
a
due

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
the
Chapter
owes
me

I
do
know
that
I
'm
`
touched
'
*NL*
for
a
hundred
francs
,
every
year
,
by
the
Curé
,
which
is
a
due
that
I
*NL*
could
very
well
do
without
.
But
surely
these
Cambremers
have
rather
a
*NL*
startling
name
.
It
ends
just
in
time
,
but
it
ends
badly
!
''
she
said
with
*NL*
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
begins
no
better
.
''
Swann
took
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
double
abbreviation
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
very
angry
and
very
proper
who
did
n't
dare
to
finish
the
first
*NL*
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
since
he
could
n't
stop
himself
beginning
the
second
,
he
'd
have
done
*NL*
better
to
finish
the
first
and
be
done
with
it
.
We
are
indulging
in
*NL*
the
most
refined
form
of
humour
,
my
dear
Charles
,
in
the
very
best
of
*NL*
taste
--
but
how
tiresome
it
is
that
I
never
see
you
now
,
''
she
went
on
in
*NL*
a
coaxing
tone
,
``
I
do
so
love
talking
to
you
.
Just
imagine
,
I
could
not
*NL*
make
that
idiot
Froberville
see
that
there
was
anything
funny
about
the
*NL*
name
Cambremer
.
Do
agree
that
life
is
a
dreadful
business
.
It
's
only
*NL*
when
I
see
you
that
I
stop
feeling
bored
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Which
was
probably
not
true
.
But
Swann
and
the
Princess
had
the
same
way
*NL*
of
looking
at
the
little
things
of
life
--
the
effect
,
if
not
the
cause
of
*NL*
which
was
a
close
analogy
between
their
modes
of
expression
and
even
of
*NL*
pronunciation
.
This
similarity
was
not
striking
because
no
two
things
*NL*
could
have
been
more
unlike
than
their
voices
.
But
if
one
took
the
*NL*
trouble
to
imagine
Swann
's
utterances
divested
of
the
sonority
that
*NL*
enwrapped
them
,
of
the
moustache
from
under
which
they
emerged
,
one
*NL*
found
that
they
were
the
same
phrases
,
the
same
inflexions
,
that
they
*NL*
had
the
`
tone
'
of
the
Guermantes
set
.
On
important
matters
,
Swann
and
*NL*
the
Princess
had
not
an
idea
in
common
.
But
since
Swann
had
become
so
*NL*
melancholy
,
and
was
always
in
that
trembling
condition
which
precedes
*NL*
a
flood
of
tears
,
he
had
the
same
need
to
speak
about
his
grief
that
*NL*
a
murderer
has
to
tell
some
one
about
his
crime
.
And
when
he
heard
*NL*
the
Princess
say
that
life
was
a
dreadful
business
,
he
felt
as
much
*NL*
comforted
as
if
she
had
spoken
to
him
of
Odette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
life
is
a
dreadful
business
!
We
must
meet
more
often
,
my
dear
*NL*
friend

What
is
so
nice
about
you
is
that
you
are
not
cheerful

We
could
*NL*
spend
a
most
pleasant
evening
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
we
could
;
why
not
come
down
to
Guermantes
?
My
mother-in-law
*NL*
would
be
wild
with
joy
.
It
's
supposed
to
be
very
ugly
down
there
,
but
*NL*
I
must
say
,
I
find
the
neighborhood
not
at
all
unattractive
;
I
have
a
*NL*
horror
of
`
picturesque
spots
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
well
,
it
's
delightful
!
''
replied
Swann
.
``
It
's
almost
too
*NL*
beautiful
,
too
much
alive
for
me
just
at
present
;
it
's
a
country
to
*NL*
be
happy
in
.
It
's
perhaps
because
I
have
lived
there
,
but
things
there
*NL*
speak
to
me
so
.
As
soon
as
a
breath
of
wind
gets
up
,
and
the
cornfields
*NL*
begin
to
stir
,
I
feel
that
some
one
is
going
to
appear
suddenly
,
that
*NL*
I
am
going
to
hear
some
news
;
and
those
little
houses
by
the
water
's
*NL*
edge
...
I
should
be
quite
wretched

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
my
dearest
Charles

do
take
care

there
's
that
appalling

again

off

's
meeting
me
*NL*
there
.
If
one
did
n't
get
news
of
you
,
sometimes
,
from
Mémé
...
Remember
,
*NL*
I
never
see
you
at
all
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
declined
.
Having
told
M.
de
Charlus
that
,
on
leaving
Mme.
de
*NL*
Saint-Euverte
's
,
he
would
go
straight
home
,
he
did
not
care
to
run
the
*NL*
risk
,
by
going
on
now
to
the
Princesse
de
Parme
's
,
of
missing
a
message
*NL*
which
he
had
,
all
the
time
,
been
hoping
to
see
brought
in
to
him
by
one
*NL*
of
the
footmen
,
during
the
party
,
and
which
he
was
perhaps
going
to
find
*NL*
left
with
his
own
porter
,
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Swann
,
''
said
Mme.
des
Laumes
that
night
to
her
husband
;
``
he
is
*NL*
always
charming
,
but
he
does
look
so
dreadfully
unhappy
.
You
will
see
*NL*
for
yourself
,
for
he
has
promised
to
dine
with
us
one
of
these
days
.
I
*NL*
do
feel
that
it
's
really
absurd
that
a
man
of
his
intelligence
should
*NL*
let
himself
be
made
to
suffer
by
a
creature
of
that
kind
,
who
is
n't
even
*NL*
interesting
,
for
they
tell
me
,
she
's
an
absolute
idiot
!
''
she
concluded
*NL*
with
the
wisdom
invariably
shewn
by
people
who
,
not
being
in
love
*NL*
themselves
,
feel
that
a
clever
man
ought
to
be
unhappy
only
about
such
*NL*
persons
as
are
worth
his
while
;
which
is
rather
like
being
astonished
*NL*
that
anyone
should
condescend
to
die
of
cholera
at
the
bidding
of
so
*NL*
insignificant
a
creature
as
the
common
bacillus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
now
wished
to
go
home
,
but
,
just
as
he
was
making
his
escape
,
*NL*
General
de
Froberville
caught
him
and
asked
for
an
introduction
to
Mme.
*NL*
de
Cambremer
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
go
back
into
the
room
to
look
for
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Swann
,
I
'd
rather
be
married
to
that
little
woman
than
killed
by
*NL*
savages
,
what
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
`
killed
by
savages
'
pierced
Swann
's
aching
heart
;
and
at
once
*NL*
he
felt
the
need
of
continuing
the
conversation
.
``
Ah
!
''
he
began
,
``
some
*NL*
fine
lives
have
been
lost
in
that
way
...
There
was
,
you
remember
,
that
*NL*
explorer
whose
remains
Dumont
d'Urville
brought
back
,
La
Pérouse
...
''
*NL*
-LRB-
and
he
was
at
once
happy
again
,
as
though
he
had
named
Odette
-RRB-
.
``
He
was
*NL*
a
fine
character
,
and
interests
me
very
much
,
does
La
Pérouse
,
''
he
ended
*NL*
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
of
course
,
La
Pérouse
,
''
said
the
General
.
``
It
's
quite
a
*NL*
well-known
name
.
There
's
a
street
called
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
anyone
in
the
Rue
La
Pérouse
?
''
asked
Swann
excitedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
Mme.
de
Chanlivault
,
the
sister
of
that
good
fellow
Chaussepierre
.
*NL*
She
gave
a
most
amusing
theatre-party
the
other
evening
.
That
's
a
house
*NL*
that
will
be
really
smart
some
day
,
you
'll
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
so
she
lives
in
the
Rue
La
Pérouse
.
It
's
attractive
;
I
like
that
*NL*
street
;
it
's
so
sombre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
it
is
n't
.
You
ca
n't
have
been
in
it
for
a
long
time
;
it
's
not
at
*NL*
all
sombre
now
;
they
're
beginning
to
build
all
round
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Swann
did
finally
introduce
M.
de
Froberville
to
the
young
Mme.
de
*NL*
Cambremer
,
since
it
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
heard
the
General
's
*NL*
name
,
she
hastily
outlined
upon
her
lips
the
smile
of
joy
and
surprise
*NL*
with
which
she
would
have
greeted
him
if
she
had
never
,
in
the
whole
*NL*
of
her
life
,
heard
anything
else
;
for
,
as
she
did
not
yet
know
all
the
*NL*
friends
of
her
new
family
,
whenever
anyone
was
presented
to
her
,
she
*NL*
assumed
that
he
must
be
one
of
them
,
and
thinking
that
she
would
shew
*NL*
her
tact
by
appearing
to
have
heard
`
such
a
lot
about
him
'
since
her
*NL*
marriage
,
she
would
hold
out
her
hand
with
an
air
of
hesitation
which
*NL*
was
meant
as
a
proof
at
once
of
the
inculcated
reserve
which
she
had
to
*NL*
overcome
and
of
the
spontaneous
friendliness
which
successfully
overcame
*NL*
it
.
And
so
her
parents-in-law
,
whom
she
still
regarded
as
the
most
*NL*
eminent
pair
in
France
,
declared
that
she
was
an
angel
;
all
the
more
*NL*
that
they
preferred
to
appear
,
in
marrying
her
to
their
son
,
to
have
*NL*
yielded
to
the
attraction
rather
of
her
natural
charm
than
of
her
*NL*
considerable
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
easy
to
see
that
you
're
a
musician
heart
and
soul
,
Madame
,
''
said
*NL*
the
General
,
alluding
to
the
incident
of
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
concert
had
begun
again
,
and
Swann
saw
that
he
could
not
*NL*
now
go
before
the
end
of
the
new
number
.
He
suffered
greatly
from
being
*NL*
shut
up
among
all
these
people
whose
stupidity
and
absurdities
wounded
*NL*
him
all
the
more
cruelly
since
,
being
ignorant
of
his
love
,
incapable
,
*NL*
had
they
known
of
it
,
of
taking
any
interest
,
or
of
doing
more
than
*NL*
smile
at
it
as
at
some
childish
joke
,
or
deplore
it
as
an
act
of
*NL*
insanity
,
they
made
it
appear
to
him
in
the
aspect
of
a
subjective
*NL*
state
which
existed
for
himself
alone
,
whose
reality
there
was
nothing
*NL*
external
to
confirm
;
he
suffered
overwhelmingly
,
to
the
point
at
which
*NL*
even
the
sound
of
the
instruments
made
him
want
to
cry
,
from
having
to
*NL*
prolong
his
exile
in
this
place
to
which
Odette
would
never
come
,
in
*NL*
which
no
one
,
nothing
was
aware
of
her
existence
,
from
which
she
was
*NL*
entirely
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
suddenly
it
was
as
though
she
had
entered
,
and
this
apparition
tore
*NL*
him
with
such
anguish
that
his
hand
rose
impulsively
to
his
heart
.
What
*NL*
had
happened
was
that
the
violin
had
risen
to
a
series
of
high
notes
,
*NL*
on
which
it
rested
as
though
expecting
something
,
an
expectancy
which
*NL*
it
prolonged
without
ceasing
to
hold
on
to
the
notes
,
in
the
exaltation
*NL*
with
which
it
already
saw
the
expected
object
approaching
,
and
with
a
*NL*
desperate
effort
to
continue
until
its
arrival
,
to
welcome
it
before
*NL*
itself
expired
,
to
keep
the
way
open
for
a
moment
longer
,
with
all
its
*NL*
remaining
strength
,
that
the
stranger
might
enter
in
,
as
one
holds
a
*NL*
door
open
that
would
otherwise
automatically
close
.
And
before
Swann
had
*NL*
had
time
to
understand
what
was
happening
,
to
think
:
``
It
is
the
little
*NL*
phrase
from
Vinteuil
's
sonata
.
I
must
n't
listen
!
''
,
all
his
memories
of
*NL*
the
days
when
Odette
had
been
in
love
with
him
,
which
he
had
succeeded
,
*NL*
up
till
that
evening
,
in
keeping
invisible
in
the
depths
of
his
being
,
*NL*
deceived
by
this
sudden
reflection
of
a
season
of
love
,
whose
sun
,
they
*NL*
supposed
,
had
dawned
again
,
had
awakened
from
their
slumber
,
had
taken
*NL*
wing
and
risen
to
sing
maddeningly
in
his
ears
,
without
pity
for
his
*NL*
present
desolation
,
the
forgotten
strains
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
place
of
the
abstract
expressions
``
the
time
when
I
was
happy
,
''
``
the
*NL*
time
when
I
was
loved
,
''
which
he
had
often
used
until
then
,
and
without
*NL*
much
suffering
,
for
his
intelligence
had
not
embodied
in
them
anything
*NL*
of
the
past
save
fictitious
extracts
which
preserved
none
of
the
*NL*
reality
,
he
now
recovered
everything
that
had
fixed
unalterably
the
*NL*
peculiar
,
volatile
essence
of
that
lost
happiness
;
he
could
see
it
all
;
*NL*
the
snowy
,
curled
petals
of
the
chrysanthemum
which
she
had
tossed
*NL*
after
him
into
his
carriage
,
which
he
had
kept
pressed
to
his
lips
,
the
*NL*
address
`
Maison
Dorée
,
'
embossed
on
the
note-paper
on
which
he
had
read
*NL*
``
My
hand
trembles
so
as
I
write
to
you
,
''
the
frowning
contraction
of
her
*NL*
eyebrows
when
she
said
pleadingly
:
``
You
wo
n't
let
it
be
very
long
before
*NL*
you
send
for
me
?
''
;
he
could
smell
the
heated
iron
of
the
barber
whom
he
*NL*
used
to
have
in
to
singe
his
hair
while
Loredan
went
to
fetch
the
little
*NL*
working
girl
;
could
feel
the
torrents
of
rain
which
fell
so
often
that
*NL*
spring
,
the
ice-cold
homeward
drive
in
his
victoria
,
by
moonlight
;
all
*NL*
the
network
of
mental
habits
,
of
seasonable
impressions
,
of
sensory
*NL*
reactions
,
which
had
extended
over
a
series
of
weeks
its
uniform
meshes
,
*NL*
by
which
his
body
now
found
itself
inextricably
held
.
At
that
time
he
*NL*
had
been
satisfying
a
sensual
curiosity
to
know
what
were
the
pleasures
*NL*
of
those
people
who
lived
for
love
alone
.
He
had
supposed
that
he
could
*NL*
stop
there
,
that
he
would
not
be
obliged
to
learn
their
sorrows
also
;
*NL*
how
small
a
thing
the
actual
charm
of
Odette
was
now
in
comparison
with
*NL*
that
formidable
terror
which
extended
it
like
a
cloudy
halo
all
around
*NL*
her
,
that
enormous
anguish
of
not
knowing
at
every
hour
of
the
day
and
*NL*
night
what
she
had
been
doing
,
of
not
possessing
her
wholly
,
at
all
*NL*
times
and
in
all
places
!
Alas
,
he
recalled
the
accents
in
which
she
had
*NL*
exclaimed
:
``
But
I
can
see
you
at
any
time
;
I
am
always
free
!
''
--
she
,
who
*NL*
was
never
free
now
;
the
interest
,
the
curiosity
that
she
had
shewn
in
*NL*
his
life
,
her
passionate
desire
that
he
should
do
her
the
favour
--
of
*NL*
which
it
was
he
who
,
then
,
had
felt
suspicious
,
as
of
a
possibly
tedious
*NL*
waste
of
his
time
and
disturbance
of
his
arrangements
--
of
granting
her
*NL*
access
to
his
study
;
how
she
had
been
obliged
to
beg
that
he
would
let
*NL*
her
take
him
to
the
Verdurins
'
;
and
,
when
he
did
allow
her
to
come
to
*NL*
him
once
a
month
,
how
she
had
first
,
before
he
would
let
himself
be
*NL*
swayed
,
had
to
repeat
what
a
joy
it
would
be
to
her
,
that
custom
of
*NL*
their
seeing
each
other
daily
,
for
which
she
had
longed
at
a
time
when
*NL*
to
him
it
had
seemed
only
a
tiresome
distraction
,
for
which
,
since
that
*NL*
time
,
she
had
conceived
a
distaste
and
had
definitely
broken
herself
*NL*
of
it
,
while
it
had
become
for
him
so
insatiable
,
so
dolorous
a
need
.
*NL*
Little
had
he
suspected
how
truly
he
spoke
when
,
on
their
third
meeting
,
*NL*
as
she
repeated
:
``
But
why
do
n't
you
let
me
come
to
you
oftener
?
''
he
had
*NL*
told
her
,
laughing
,
and
in
a
vein
of
gallantry
,
that
it
was
for
fear
of
*NL*
forming
a
hopeless
passion
.
Now
,
alas
,
it
still
happened
at
times
that
*NL*
she
wrote
to
him
from
a
restaurant
or
hotel
,
on
paper
which
bore
a
*NL*
printed
address
,
but
printed
in
letters
of
fire
that
seared
his
heart
.
*NL*
``
Written
from
the
Hôtel
Vouillemont
.
What
on
earth
can
she
have
gone
*NL*
there
for
?
With
whom
?
What
happened
there
?
''
He
remembered
the
gas-jets
*NL*
that
were
being
extinguished
along
the
Boulevard
des
Italiens
when
he
*NL*
had
met
her
,
when
all
hope
was
gone
among
the
errant
shades
upon
that
*NL*
night
which
had
seemed
to
him
almost
supernatural
and
which
now
-LRB-
that
*NL*
night
of
a
period
when
he
had
not
even
to
ask
himself
whether
he
would
*NL*
be
annoying
her
by
looking
for
her
and
by
finding
her
,
so
certain
was
he
*NL*
that
she
knew
no
greater
happiness
than
to
see
him
and
to
let
him
take
*NL*
her
home
-RRB-
belonged
indeed
to
a
mysterious
world
to
which
one
never
may
*NL*
return
again
once
its
doors
are
closed
.
And
Swann
could
distinguish
,
*NL*
standing
,
motionless
,
before
that
scene
of
happiness
in
which
it
lived
*NL*
again
,
a
wretched
figure
which
filled
him
with
such
pity
,
because
he
*NL*
did
not
at
first
recognise
who
it
was
,
that
he
must
lower
his
head
,
*NL*
lest
anyone
should
observe
that
his
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
.
It
was
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
realised
this
,
his
pity
ceased
;
he
was
jealous
,
now
,
of
that
*NL*
other
self
whom
she
had
loved
,
he
was
jealous
of
those
men
of
whom
he
*NL*
had
so
often
said
,
without
much
suffering
:
``
Perhaps
she
's
in
love
with
*NL*
them
,
''
now
that
he
had
exchanged
the
vague
idea
of
loving
,
in
*NL*
which
there
is
no
love
,
for
the
petals
of
the
chrysanthemum
and
the
*NL*
`
letter-heading
'
of
the
Maison
d'Or
;
for
they
were
full
of
love
.
*NL*
And
then
,
his
anguish
becoming
too
keen
,
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
*NL*
forehead
,
let
the
monocle
drop
from
his
eye
,
and
wiped
its
glass
.
And
*NL*
doubtless
,
if
he
had
caught
sight
of
himself
at
that
moment
,
he
would
*NL*
have
added
to
the
collection
of
the
monocles
which
he
had
already
*NL*
identified
,
this
one
which
he
removed
,
like
an
importunate
,
worrying
*NL*
thought
,
from
his
head
,
while
from
its
misty
surface
,
with
his
*NL*
handkerchief
,
he
sought
to
obliterate
his
cares
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
in
the
music
of
the
violin
--
if
one
does
not
see
the
instrument
*NL*
itself
,
and
so
can
not
relate
what
one
hears
to
its
form
,
which
modifies
*NL*
the
fullness
of
the
sound
--
accents
which
are
so
closely
akin
to
those
*NL*
of
certain
contralto
voices
,
that
one
has
the
illusion
that
a
singer
has
*NL*
taken
her
place
amid
the
orchestra
.
One
raises
one
's
eyes
;
one
sees
only
*NL*
the
wooden
case
,
magical
as
a
Chinese
box
;
but
,
at
moments
,
one
is
*NL*
still
tricked
by
the
deceiving
appeal
of
the
Siren
;
at
times
,
too
,
one
*NL*
believes
that
one
is
listening
to
a
captive
spirit
,
struggling
in
the
*NL*
darkness
of
its
masterful
box
,
a
box
quivering
with
enchantment
,
like
a
*NL*
devil
immersed
in
a
stoup
of
holy
water
;
sometimes
,
again
,
it
is
in
the
*NL*
air
,
at
large
,
like
a
pure
and
supernatural
creature
that
reveals
to
the
*NL*
ear
,
as
it
passes
,
its
invisible
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
though
the
musicians
were
not
nearly
so
much
playing
the
little
*NL*
phrase
as
performing
the
rites
on
which
it
insisted
before
it
would
*NL*
consent
to
appear
,
as
proceeding
to
utter
the
incantations
necessary
*NL*
to
procure
,
and
to
prolong
for
a
few
moments
,
the
miracle
of
its
*NL*
apparition
,
Swann
,
who
was
no
more
able
now
to
see
it
than
if
it
had
*NL*
belonged
to
a
world
of
ultra-violet
light
,
who
experienced
something
*NL*
like
the
refreshing
sense
of
a
metamorphosis
in
the
momentary
blindness
*NL*
with
which
he
had
been
struck
as
he
approached
it
,
Swann
felt
that
it
*NL*
was
present
,
like
a
protective
goddess
,
a
confidant
of
his
love
,
who
,
so
*NL*
as
to
be
able
to
come
to
him
through
the
crowd
,
and
to
draw
him
aside
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
,
had
disguised
herself
in
this
sweeping
cloak
of
sound
.
And
*NL*
as
she
passed
him
,
light
,
soothing
,
as
softly
murmured
as
the
perfume
*NL*
of
a
flower
,
telling
him
what
she
had
to
say
,
every
word
of
which
*NL*
he
closely
scanned
,
sorry
to
see
them
fly
away
so
fast
,
he
made
*NL*
involuntarily
with
his
lips
the
motion
of
kissing
,
as
it
went
by
him
,
*NL*
the
harmonious
,
fleeting
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
was
no
longer
in
exile
and
alone
since
she
,
who
*NL*
addressed
herself
to
him
,
spoke
to
him
in
a
whisper
of
Odette
.
For
he
*NL*
had
no
longer
,
as
of
old
,
the
impression
that
Odette
and
he
were
not
*NL*
known
to
the
little
phrase
.
Had
it
not
often
been
the
witness
of
their
*NL*
joys
?
True
that
,
as
often
,
it
had
warned
him
of
their
frailty
.
And
*NL*
indeed
,
whereas
,
in
that
distant
time
,
he
had
divined
an
element
of
*NL*
suffering
in
its
smile
,
in
its
limpid
and
disillusioned
intonation
,
*NL*
to-night
he
found
there
rather
the
charm
of
a
resignation
that
was
*NL*
almost
gay
.
Of
those
sorrows
,
of
which
the
little
phrase
had
spoken
*NL*
to
him
then
,
which
he
had
seen
it
--
without
his
being
touched
by
them
*NL*
himself
--
carry
past
him
,
smiling
,
on
its
sinuous
and
rapid
course
,
of
*NL*
those
sorrows
which
were
now
become
his
own
,
without
his
having
any
hope
*NL*
of
being
,
ever
,
delivered
from
them
,
it
seemed
to
say
to
him
,
as
once
*NL*
it
had
said
of
his
happiness
:
``
What
does
all
that
matter
;
it
is
all
*NL*
nothing
.
''
And
Swann
's
thoughts
were
borne
for
the
first
time
on
a
wave
*NL*
of
pity
and
tenderness
towards
that
Vinteuil
,
towards
that
unknown
,
*NL*
exalted
brother
who
also
must
have
suffered
so
greatly
;
what
could
his
*NL*
life
have
been
?
From
the
depths
of
what
well
of
sorrow
could
he
have
*NL*
drawn
that
god-like
strength
,
that
unlimited
power
of
creation
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
was
the
little
phrase
that
spoke
to
him
of
the
vanity
of
his
*NL*
sufferings
,
Swann
found
a
sweetness
in
that
very
wisdom
which
,
but
a
*NL*
little
while
back
,
had
seemed
to
him
intolerable
when
he
thought
that
*NL*
he
could
read
it
on
the
faces
of
indifferent
strangers
,
who
would
regard
*NL*
his
love
as
a
digression
that
was
without
importance
.
'T
was
because
the
*NL*
little
phrase
,
unlike
them
,
whatever
opinion
it
might
hold
on
the
short
*NL*
duration
of
these
states
of
the
soul
,
saw
in
them
something
not
,
as
*NL*
everyone
else
saw
,
less
serious
than
the
events
of
everyday
life
,
but
,
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
so
far
superior
to
everyday
life
as
to
be
alone
worthy
*NL*
of
the
trouble
of
expressing
it
.
Those
graces
of
an
intimate
sorrow
,
*NL*
't
was
them
that
the
phrase
endeavoured
to
imitate
,
to
create
anew
;
and
*NL*
even
their
essence
,
for
all
that
it
consists
in
being
incommunicable
and
*NL*
in
appearing
trivial
to
everyone
save
him
who
has
experience
of
them
,
*NL*
the
little
phrase
had
captured
,
had
rendered
visible
.
So
much
so
that
it
*NL*
made
their
value
be
confessed
,
their
divine
sweetness
be
tasted
by
*NL*
all
those
same
onlookers
--
provided
only
that
they
were
in
any
sense
*NL*
musical
--
who
,
the
next
moment
,
would
ignore
,
would
disown
them
in
real
*NL*
life
,
in
every
individual
love
that
came
into
being
beneath
their
eyes
.
*NL*
Doubtless
the
form
in
which
it
had
codified
those
graces
could
not
be
*NL*
analysed
into
any
logical
elements
.
But
ever
since
,
more
than
a
year
*NL*
before
,
discovering
to
him
many
of
the
riches
of
his
own
soul
,
the
love
*NL*
of
music
had
been
born
,
and
for
a
time
at
least
had
dwelt
in
him
,
Swann
*NL*
had
regarded
musical
_
motifs
_
as
actual
ideas
,
of
another
world
,
of
*NL*
another
order
,
ideas
veiled
in
shadows
,
unknown
,
impenetrable
by
*NL*
the
human
mind
,
which
none
the
less
were
perfectly
distinct
one
from
*NL*
another
,
unequal
among
themselves
in
value
and
in
significance
.
When
,
*NL*
after
that
first
evening
at
the
Verdurins
'
,
he
had
had
the
little
*NL*
phrase
played
over
to
him
again
,
and
had
sought
to
disentangle
from
his
*NL*
confused
impressions
how
it
was
that
,
like
a
perfume
or
a
caress
,
*NL*
it
swept
over
and
enveloped
him
,
he
had
observed
that
it
was
to
the
*NL*
closeness
of
the
intervals
between
the
five
notes
which
composed
it
and
*NL*
to
the
constant
repetition
of
two
of
them
that
was
due
that
impression
*NL*
of
a
frigid
,
a
contracted
sweetness
;
but
in
reality
he
knew
that
he
*NL*
was
basing
this
conclusion
not
upon
the
phrase
itself
,
but
merely
upon
*NL*
certain
equivalents
,
substituted
-LRB-
for
his
mind
's
convenience
-RRB-
for
the
*NL*
mysterious
entity
of
which
he
had
become
aware
,
before
ever
he
knew
the
*NL*
Verdurins
,
at
that
earlier
party
,
when
for
the
first
time
he
had
heard
*NL*
the
sonata
played
.
He
knew
that
his
memory
of
the
piano
falsified
still
*NL*
further
the
perspective
in
which
he
saw
the
music
,
that
the
field
*NL*
open
to
the
musician
is
not
a
miserable
stave
of
seven
notes
,
but
an
*NL*
immeasurable
keyboard
-LRB-
still
,
almost
all
of
it
,
unknown
-RRB-
,
on
which
,
*NL*
here
and
there
only
,
separated
by
the
gross
darkness
of
its
unexplored
*NL*
tracts
,
some
few
among
the
millions
of
keys
,
keys
of
tenderness
,
of
*NL*
passion
,
of
courage
,
of
serenity
,
which
compose
it
,
each
one
differing
*NL*
from
all
the
rest
as
one
universe
differs
from
another
,
have
been
*NL*
discovered
by
certain
great
artists
who
do
us
the
service
,
when
they
*NL*
awaken
in
us
the
emotion
corresponding
to
the
theme
which
they
have
*NL*
found
,
of
shewing
us
what
richness
,
what
variety
lies
hidden
,
unknown
to
*NL*
us
,
in
that
great
black
impenetrable
night
,
discouraging
exploration
,
*NL*
of
our
soul
,
which
we
have
been
content
to
regard
as
valueless
and
*NL*
waste
and
void
.
Vinteuil
had
been
one
of
those
musicians
.
In
his
little
*NL*
phrase
,
albeit
it
presented
to
the
mind
's
eye
a
clouded
surface
,
there
*NL*
was
contained
,
one
felt
,
a
matter
so
consistent
,
so
explicit
,
to
which
*NL*
the
phrase
gave
so
new
,
so
original
a
force
,
that
those
who
had
once
*NL*
heard
it
preserved
the
memory
of
it
in
the
treasure-chamber
of
*NL*
their
minds
.
Swann
would
repair
to
it
as
to
a
conception
of
love
and
*NL*
happiness
,
of
which
at
once
he
knew
as
well
in
what
respects
it
was
*NL*
peculiar
as
he
would
know
of
the
_
Princesse
de
Clèves
_
,
or
of
_
René
_
,
*NL*
should
either
of
those
titles
occur
to
him
.
Even
when
he
was
not
*NL*
thinking
of
the
little
phrase
,
it
existed
,
latent
,
in
his
mind
,
in
the
*NL*
same
way
as
certain
other
conceptions
without
material
equivalent
,
such
*NL*
as
our
notions
of
light
,
of
sound
,
of
perspective
,
of
bodily
desire
,
the
*NL*
rich
possessions
wherewith
our
inner
temple
is
diversified
and
adorned
.
*NL*
Perhaps
we
shall
lose
them
,
perhaps
they
will
be
obliterated
,
if
we
*NL*
return
to
nothing
in
the
dust
.
But
so
long
as
we
are
alive
,
we
can
no
*NL*
more
bring
ourselves
to
a
state
in
which
we
shall
not
have
known
*NL*
them
than
we
can
with
regard
to
any
material
object
,
than
we
can
,
for
*NL*
example
,
doubt
the
luminosity
of
a
lamp
that
has
just
been
lighted
,
in
*NL*
view
of
the
changed
aspect
of
everything
in
the
room
,
from
which
has
*NL*
vanished
even
the
memory
of
the
darkness
.
In
that
way
Vinteuil
's
phrase
,
*NL*
like
some
theme
,
say
,
in
_
Tristan
_
,
which
represents
to
us
also
a
*NL*
certain
acquisition
of
sentiment
,
has
espoused
our
mortal
state
,
had
*NL*
endued
a
vesture
of
humanity
that
was
affecting
enough
.
Its
destiny
was
*NL*
linked
,
for
the
future
,
with
that
of
the
human
soul
,
of
which
it
was
one
*NL*
of
the
special
,
the
most
distinctive
ornaments
.
Perhaps
it
is
not-being
*NL*
that
is
the
true
state
,
and
all
our
dream
of
life
is
without
existence
;
*NL*
but
,
if
so
,
we
feel
that
it
must
be
that
these
phrases
of
music
,
these
*NL*
conceptions
which
exist
in
relation
to
our
dream
,
are
nothing
either
.
*NL*
We
shall
perish
,
but
we
have
for
our
hostages
these
divine
captives
who
*NL*
shall
follow
and
share
our
fate
.
And
death
in
their
company
is
something
*NL*
less
bitter
,
less
inglorious
,
perhaps
even
less
certain
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Swann
was
not
mistaken
in
believing
that
the
phrase
of
the
sonata
*NL*
did
,
really
,
exist
.
Human
as
it
was
from
this
point
of
view
,
it
*NL*
belonged
,
none
the
less
,
to
an
order
of
supernatural
creatures
whom
we
*NL*
have
never
seen
,
but
whom
,
in
spite
of
that
,
we
recognise
and
acclaim
*NL*
with
rapture
when
some
explorer
of
the
unseen
contrives
to
coax
one
*NL*
forth
,
to
bring
it
down
from
that
divine
world
to
which
he
has
access
*NL*
to
shine
for
a
brief
moment
in
the
firmament
of
ours
.
This
was
what
*NL*
Vinteuil
had
done
for
the
little
phrase
.
Swann
felt
that
the
composer
*NL*
had
been
content
-LRB-
with
the
musical
instruments
at
his
disposal
-RRB-
to
*NL*
draw
aside
its
veil
,
to
make
it
visible
,
following
and
respecting
its
*NL*
outlines
with
a
hand
so
loving
,
so
prudent
,
so
delicate
and
so
sure
,
*NL*
that
the
sound
altered
at
every
moment
,
blunting
itself
to
indicate
a
*NL*
shadow
,
springing
back
into
life
when
it
must
follow
the
curve
of
some
*NL*
more
bold
projection
.
And
one
proof
that
Swann
was
not
mistaken
when
he
*NL*
believed
in
the
real
existence
of
this
phrase
,
was
that
anyone
with
an
*NL*
ear
at
all
delicate
for
music
would
at
once
have
detected
the
imposture
*NL*
had
Vinteuil
,
endowed
with
less
power
to
see
and
to
render
its
forms
,
*NL*
sought
to
dissemble
-LRB-
by
adding
a
line
,
here
and
there
,
of
his
own
*NL*
invention
-RRB-
the
dimness
of
his
vision
or
the
feebleness
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
phrase
had
disappeared
.
Swann
knew
that
it
would
come
again
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
last
movement
,
after
a
long
passage
which
Mme.
Verdurin
's
*NL*
pianist
always
`
skipped
.
'
There
were
in
this
passage
some
admirable
*NL*
ideas
which
Swann
had
not
distinguished
on
first
hearing
the
sonata
,
and
*NL*
which
he
now
perceived
,
as
if
they
had
,
in
the
cloakroom
of
his
memory
,
*NL*
divested
themselves
of
their
uniform
disguise
of
novelty
.
Swann
listened
*NL*
to
all
the
scattered
themes
which
entered
into
the
composition
of
*NL*
the
phrase
,
as
its
premises
enter
into
the
inevitable
conclusion
of
a
*NL*
syllogism
;
he
was
assisting
at
the
mystery
of
its
birth
.
``
Audacity
,
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
to
himself
,
``
as
inspired
,
perhaps
,
as
a
Lavoisier
's
or
an
*NL*
Ampere
's
,
the
audacity
of
a
Vinteuil
making
experiment
,
discovering
*NL*
the
secret
laws
that
govern
an
unknown
force
,
driving
across
a
region
*NL*
unexplored
towards
the
one
possible
goal
the
invisible
team
in
which
he
*NL*
has
placed
his
trust
and
which
he
never
may
discern
!
''
How
charming
*NL*
the
dialogue
which
Swann
now
heard
between
piano
and
violin
,
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
last
passage
.
The
suppression
of
human
speech
,
so
far
*NL*
from
letting
fancy
reign
there
uncontrolled
-LRB-
as
one
might
have
thought
-RRB-
,
*NL*
had
eliminated
it
altogether
.
Never
was
spoken
language
of
such
*NL*
inflexible
necessity
,
never
had
it
known
questions
so
pertinent
,
such
*NL*
obvious
replies
.
At
first
the
piano
complained
alone
,
like
a
bird
*NL*
deserted
by
its
mate
;
the
violin
heard
and
answered
it
,
as
from
a
*NL*
neighbouring
tree
.
It
was
as
at
the
first
beginning
of
the
world
,
as
*NL*
if
there
were
not
yet
but
these
twain
upon
the
earth
,
or
rather
in
this
*NL*
world
closed
against
all
the
rest
,
so
fashioned
by
the
logic
of
its
*NL*
creator
that
in
it
there
should
never
be
any
but
themselves
;
the
world
*NL*
of
this
sonata
.
Was
it
a
bird
,
was
it
the
soul
,
not
yet
made
perfect
,
of
*NL*
the
little
phrase
,
was
it
a
fairy
,
invisibly
somewhere
lamenting
,
whose
*NL*
plaint
the
piano
heard
and
tenderly
repeated
?
Its
cries
were
so
sudden
*NL*
that
the
violinist
must
snatch
up
his
bow
and
race
to
catch
them
as
they
*NL*
came
.
Marvellous
bird
!
The
violinist
seemed
to
wish
to
charm
,
to
tame
,
*NL*
to
woo
,
to
win
it
.
Already
it
had
passed
into
his
soul
,
already
the
*NL*
little
phrase
which
it
evoked
shook
like
a
medium
's
the
body
of
the
*NL*
violinist
,
`
possessed
'
indeed
.
Swann
knew
that
the
phrase
was
going
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
once
again
.
And
his
personality
was
now
so
divided
that
*NL*
the
strain
of
waiting
for
the
imminent
moment
when
he
would
find
himself
*NL*
face
to
face
,
once
more
,
with
the
phrase
,
convulsed
him
in
one
of
those
*NL*
sobs
which
a
fine
line
of
poetry
or
a
piece
of
alarming
news
will
wring
*NL*
from
us
,
not
when
we
are
alone
,
but
when
we
repeat
one
or
the
other
to
*NL*
a
friend
,
in
whom
we
see
ourselves
reflected
,
like
a
third
person
,
whose
*NL*
probable
emotion
softens
him
.
It
reappeared
,
but
this
time
to
remain
*NL*
poised
in
the
air
,
and
to
sport
there
for
a
moment
only
,
as
though
*NL*
immobile
,
and
shortly
to
expire
.
And
so
Swann
lost
nothing
of
the
*NL*
precious
time
for
which
it
lingered
.
It
was
still
there
,
like
an
*NL*
iridescent
bubble
that
floats
for
a
while
unbroken
.
As
a
rainbow
,
when
*NL*
its
brightness
fades
,
seems
to
subside
,
then
soars
again
and
,
before
it
*NL*
is
extinguished
,
is
glorified
with
greater
splendour
than
it
has
ever
*NL*
shewn
;
so
to
the
two
colours
which
the
phrase
had
hitherto
allowed
to
*NL*
appear
it
added
others
now
,
chords
shot
with
every
hue
in
the
prism
,
and
*NL*
made
them
sing
.
Swann
dared
not
move
,
and
would
have
liked
to
compel
all
*NL*
the
other
people
in
the
room
to
remain
still
also
,
as
if
the
slightest
*NL*
movement
might
embarrass
the
magic
presence
,
supernatural
,
delicious
,
*NL*
frail
,
that
would
so
easily
vanish
.
But
no
one
,
as
it
happened
,
dreamed
*NL*
of
speaking
.
The
ineffable
utterance
of
one
solitary
man
,
absent
,
*NL*
perhaps
dead
-LRB-
Swann
did
not
know
whether
Vinteuil
were
still
alive
-RRB-
,
*NL*
breathed
out
above
the
rites
of
those
two
hierophants
,
sufficed
to
*NL*
arrest
the
attention
of
three
hundred
minds
,
and
made
of
that
stage
on
*NL*
which
a
soul
was
thus
called
into
being
one
of
the
noblest
altars
on
*NL*
which
a
supernatural
ceremony
could
be
performed
.
It
followed
that
,
when
*NL*
the
phrase
at
last
was
finished
,
and
only
its
fragmentary
echoes
floated
*NL*
among
the
subsequent
themes
which
had
already
taken
its
place
,
if
Swann
*NL*
at
first
was
annoyed
to
see
the
Comtesse
de
Monteriender
,
famed
for
her
*NL*
imbecilities
,
lean
over
towards
him
to
confide
in
him
her
impressions
,
*NL*
before
even
the
sonata
had
come
to
an
end
;
he
could
not
refrain
from
*NL*
smiling
,
and
perhaps
also
found
an
underlying
sense
,
which
she
was
*NL*
incapable
of
perceiving
,
in
the
words
that
she
used
.
Dazzled
by
the
*NL*
virtuosity
of
the
performers
,
the
Comtesse
exclaimed
to
Swann
:
``
It
's
*NL*
astonishing
!
I
have
never
seen
anything
to
beat
it
...
''
But
a
scrupulous
*NL*
regard
for
accuracy
making
her
correct
her
first
assertion
,
she
added
*NL*
the
reservation
:
``
anything
to
beat
it
...
since
the
table-turning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
evening
,
Swann
understood
that
the
feeling
which
Odette
had
*NL*
once
had
for
him
would
never
revive
,
that
his
hopes
of
happiness
would
*NL*
not
be
realised
now
.
And
the
days
on
which
,
by
a
lucky
chance
,
she
had
*NL*
once
more
shewn
herself
kind
and
loving
to
him
,
or
if
she
had
paid
him
*NL*
any
attention
,
he
recorded
those
apparent
and
misleading
signs
of
*NL*
a
slight
movement
on
her
part
towards
him
with
the
same
tender
and
*NL*
sceptical
solicitude
,
the
desperate
joy
that
people
reveal
who
,
when
*NL*
they
are
nursing
a
friend
in
the
last
days
of
an
incurable
malady
,
*NL*
relate
,
as
significant
facts
of
infinite
value
:
``
Yesterday
he
went
*NL*
through
his
accounts
himself
,
and
actually
corrected
a
mistake
that
we
*NL*
had
made
in
adding
them
up
;
he
ate
an
egg
to-day
and
seemed
quite
to
*NL*
enjoy
it
,
if
he
digests
it
properly
we
shall
try
him
with
a
cutlet
*NL*
to-morrow
,
''
--
although
they
themselves
know
that
these
things
are
*NL*
meaningless
on
the
eve
of
an
inevitable
death
.
No
doubt
Swann
was
*NL*
assured
that
if
he
had
now
been
living
at
a
distance
from
Odette
he
*NL*
would
gradually
have
lost
all
interest
in
her
,
so
that
he
would
have
*NL*
been
glad
to
learn
that
she
was
leaving
Paris
for
ever
;
he
would
have
*NL*
had
the
courage
to
remain
there
;
but
he
had
not
the
courage
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
often
thought
of
going
.
Now
that
he
was
once
again
at
work
upon
*NL*
his
essay
on
Vermeer
,
he
wanted
to
return
,
for
a
few
days
at
least
,
to
*NL*
The
Hague
,
to
Dresden
,
to
Brunswick
.
He
was
certain
that
a
`
Toilet
of
*NL*
Diana
'
which
had
been
acquired
by
the
Mauritshuis
at
the
Goldschmidt
*NL*
sale
as
a
Nicholas
Maes
was
in
reality
a
Vermeer
.
And
he
would
have
*NL*
liked
to
be
able
to
examine
the
picture
on
the
spot
,
so
as
to
strengthen
*NL*
his
conviction
.
But
to
leave
Paris
while
Odette
was
there
,
and
even
when
*NL*
she
was
not
there
--
for
in
strange
places
where
our
sensations
have
not
*NL*
been
numbed
by
habit
,
we
refresh
,
we
revive
an
old
pain
--
was
for
him
so
*NL*
cruel
a
project
that
he
felt
himself
to
be
capable
of
entertaining
it
*NL*
incessantly
in
his
mind
only
because
he
knew
himself
to
be
resolute
in
*NL*
his
determination
never
to
put
it
into
effect
.
But
it
would
happen
*NL*
that
,
while
he
was
asleep
,
the
intention
to
travel
would
reawaken
in
him
*NL*
-LRB-
without
his
remembering
that
this
particular
tour
was
impossible
-RRB-
and
*NL*
would
be
realised
.
One
night
he
dreamed
that
he
was
going
away
for
a
*NL*
year
;
leaning
from
the
window
of
the
train
towards
a
young
man
on
the
*NL*
platform
who
wept
as
he
bade
him
farewell
,
he
was
seeking
to
persuade
*NL*
this
young
man
to
come
away
also
.
The
train
began
to
move
;
he
awoke
*NL*
in
alarm
,
and
remembered
that
he
was
not
going
away
,
that
he
would
see
*NL*
Odette
that
evening
,
and
next
day
and
almost
every
day
.
And
then
,
being
*NL*
still
deeply
moved
by
his
dream
,
he
would
thank
heaven
for
those
special
*NL*
circumstances
which
made
him
independent
,
thanks
to
which
he
could
*NL*
remain
in
Odette
's
vicinity
,
and
could
even
succeed
in
making
her
allow
*NL*
him
to
see
her
sometimes
;
and
,
counting
over
the
list
of
his
advantages
:
*NL*
his
social
position
--
his
fortune
,
from
which
she
stood
too
often
in
*NL*
need
of
assistance
not
to
shrink
from
the
prospect
of
a
definite
rupture
*NL*
-LRB-
having
even
,
so
people
said
,
an
ulterior
plan
of
getting
him
to
marry
*NL*
her
-RRB-
--
his
friendship
with
M.
de
Charlus
,
which
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
*NL*
had
never
won
him
any
very
great
favour
from
Odette
,
but
which
gave
him
*NL*
the
pleasant
feeling
that
she
was
always
hearing
complimentary
things
*NL*
said
about
him
by
this
common
friend
for
whom
she
had
so
great
an
*NL*
esteem
--
and
even
his
own
intelligence
,
the
whole
of
which
he
employed
in
*NL*
weaving
,
every
day
,
a
fresh
plot
which
would
make
his
presence
,
if
not
*NL*
agreeable
,
at
any
rate
necessary
to
Odette
--
he
thought
of
what
might
*NL*
have
happened
to
him
if
all
these
advantages
had
been
lacking
,
he
*NL*
thought
that
,
if
he
had
been
,
like
so
many
other
men
,
poor
and
humble
,
*NL*
without
resources
,
forced
to
undertake
any
task
that
might
be
offered
to
*NL*
him
,
or
tied
down
by
parents
or
by
a
wife
,
he
might
have
been
obliged
*NL*
to
part
from
Odette
,
that
that
dream
,
the
terror
of
which
was
still
so
*NL*
recent
,
might
well
have
been
true
;
and
he
said
to
himself
:
``
People
do
n't
*NL*
know
when
they
are
happy
.
They
're
never
so
unhappy
as
they
think
they
*NL*
are
.
''
But
he
reflected
that
this
existence
had
lasted
already
for
*NL*
several
years
,
that
all
that
he
could
now
hope
for
was
that
it
should
*NL*
last
for
ever
,
that
he
would
sacrifice
his
work
,
his
pleasures
,
his
*NL*
friends
,
in
fact
the
whole
of
his
life
to
the
daily
expectation
of
a
*NL*
meeting
which
,
when
it
occurred
,
would
bring
him
no
happiness
;
and
he
*NL*
asked
himself
whether
he
was
not
mistaken
,
whether
the
circumstances
*NL*
that
had
favoured
their
relations
and
had
prevented
a
final
rupture
had
*NL*
not
done
a
disservice
to
his
career
,
whether
the
outcome
to
be
*NL*
desired
was
not
that
as
to
which
he
rejoiced
that
it
happened
only
in
*NL*
dreams
--
his
own
departure
;
and
he
said
to
himself
that
people
did
not
*NL*
know
when
they
were
unhappy
,
that
they
were
never
so
happy
as
they
*NL*
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
hoped
that
she
would
die
,
painlessly
,
in
some
accident
,
she
*NL*
who
was
out
of
doors
in
the
streets
,
crossing
busy
thoroughfares
,
*NL*
from
morning
to
night
.
And
as
she
always
returned
safe
and
sound
,
he
*NL*
marvelled
at
the
strength
,
at
the
suppleness
of
the
human
body
,
which
*NL*
was
able
continually
to
hold
in
check
,
to
outwit
all
the
perils
that
*NL*
environed
it
-LRB-
which
to
Swann
seemed
innumerable
,
since
his
own
secret
*NL*
desire
had
strewn
them
in
her
path
-RRB-
,
and
so
allowed
its
occupant
,
the
*NL*
soul
,
to
abandon
itself
,
day
after
day
,
and
almost
with
impunity
,
to
its
*NL*
career
of
mendacity
,
to
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
.
And
Swann
felt
a
very
*NL*
cordial
sympathy
with
that
Mahomet
II
whose
portrait
by
Bellini
he
*NL*
admired
,
who
,
on
finding
that
he
had
fallen
madly
in
love
with
one
of
*NL*
his
wives
,
stabbed
her
,
in
order
,
as
his
Venetian
biographer
artlessly
*NL*
relates
,
to
recover
his
spiritual
freedom
.
Then
he
would
be
ashamed
*NL*
of
thinking
thus
only
of
himself
,
and
his
own
sufferings
would
seem
to
*NL*
deserve
no
pity
now
that
he
himself
was
disposing
so
cheaply
of
Odette
's
*NL*
very
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
he
was
unable
to
separate
himself
from
her
without
a
subsequent
*NL*
return
,
if
at
least
he
had
seen
her
continuously
and
without
separations
*NL*
his
grief
would
ultimately
have
been
assuaged
,
and
his
love
would
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
have
died
.
And
from
the
moment
when
she
did
not
wish
to
leave
*NL*
Paris
for
ever
he
had
hoped
that
she
would
never
go
.
As
he
knew
that
her
*NL*
one
prolonged
absence
,
every
year
,
was
in
August
and
September
,
he
had
*NL*
abundant
opportunity
,
several
months
in
advance
,
to
dissociate
from
it
*NL*
the
grim
picture
of
her
absence
throughout
Eternity
which
was
lodged
in
*NL*
him
by
anticipation
,
and
which
,
consisting
of
days
closely
akin
to
the
*NL*
days
through
which
he
was
then
passing
,
floated
in
a
cold
transparency
*NL*
in
his
mind
,
which
it
saddened
and
depressed
,
though
without
causing
him
*NL*
any
intolerable
pain
.
But
that
conception
of
the
future
,
that
flowing
*NL*
stream
,
colourless
and
unconfined
,
a
single
word
from
Odette
sufficed
*NL*
to
penetrate
through
all
Swann
's
defences
,
and
like
a
block
of
ice
*NL*
immobilised
it
,
congealed
its
fluidity
,
made
it
freeze
altogether
;
and
*NL*
Swann
felt
himself
suddenly
filled
with
an
enormous
and
unbreakable
mass
*NL*
which
pressed
on
the
inner
walls
of
his
consciousness
until
he
was
fain
*NL*
to
burst
asunder
;
for
Odette
had
said
casually
,
watching
him
with
a
*NL*
malicious
smile
:
``
Forcheville
is
going
for
a
fine
trip
at
Whitsuntide
.
*NL*
He
's
going
to
Egypt
!
''
and
Swann
had
at
once
understood
that
this
meant
:
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
Egypt
at
Whitsuntide
with
Forcheville
.
''
And
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
if
,
a
few
days
later
,
Swann
began
:
``
About
that
trip
that
you
told
me
you
*NL*
were
going
to
take
with
Forcheville
,
''
she
would
answer
carelessly
:
``
Yes
,
*NL*
my
dear
boy
,
we
're
starting
on
the
19th
;
we
'll
send
you
a
`
view
'
of
the
*NL*
Pyramids
.
''
Then
he
was
determined
to
know
whether
she
was
Forcheville
's
*NL*
mistress
,
to
ask
her
point-blank
,
to
insist
upon
her
telling
him
.
He
*NL*
knew
that
there
were
some
perjuries
which
,
being
so
superstitious
,
she
*NL*
would
not
commit
,
and
besides
,
the
fear
,
which
had
hitherto
restrained
*NL*
his
curiosity
,
of
making
Odette
angry
if
he
questioned
her
,
of
making
*NL*
himself
odious
,
had
ceased
to
exist
now
that
he
had
lost
all
hope
of
*NL*
ever
being
loved
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
received
an
anonymous
letter
which
told
him
that
Odette
had
*NL*
been
the
mistress
of
countless
men
-LRB-
several
of
whom
it
named
,
among
*NL*
them
Forcheville
,
M.
de
Bréauté
and
the
painter
-RRB-
and
women
,
and
that
she
*NL*
frequented
houses
of
ill-fame
.
He
was
tormented
by
the
discovery
that
*NL*
there
was
to
be
numbered
among
his
friends
a
creature
capable
of
*NL*
sending
him
such
a
letter
-LRB-
for
certain
details
betrayed
in
the
writer
a
*NL*
familiarity
with
his
private
life
-RRB-
.
He
wondered
who
it
could
be
.
But
he
*NL*
had
never
had
any
suspicion
with
regard
to
the
unknown
actions
of
other
*NL*
people
,
those
which
had
no
visible
connection
with
what
they
said
.
*NL*
And
when
he
wanted
to
know
whether
it
was
rather
beneath
the
apparent
*NL*
character
of
M.
de
Charlus
,
or
of
M.
des
Laumes
,
or
of
M.
d'Orsan
that
*NL*
he
must
place
the
untravelled
region
in
which
this
ignoble
action
might
*NL*
have
had
its
birth
;
as
none
of
these
men
had
ever
,
in
conversation
*NL*
with
Swann
,
suggested
that
he
approved
of
anonymous
letters
,
and
as
*NL*
everything
that
they
had
ever
said
to
him
implied
that
they
strongly
*NL*
disapproved
,
he
saw
no
further
reason
for
associating
this
infamy
with
*NL*
the
character
of
any
one
of
them
more
than
with
the
rest
.
M.
de
Charlus
*NL*
was
somewhat
inclined
to
eccentricity
,
but
he
was
fundamentally
good
and
*NL*
kind
;
M.
des
Laumes
was
a
trifle
dry
,
but
wholesome
and
straight
.
As
for
*NL*
M.
d'Orsan
,
Swann
had
never
met
anyone
who
,
even
in
the
most
depressing
*NL*
circumstances
,
would
come
to
him
with
a
more
heartfelt
utterance
,
would
*NL*
act
more
properly
or
with
more
discretion
.
So
much
so
that
he
was
unable
*NL*
to
understand
the
rather
indelicate
part
commonly
attributed
to
M.
*NL*
d'Orsan
in
his
relations
with
a
certain
wealthy
woman
,
and
that
whenever
*NL*
he
thought
of
him
he
was
obliged
to
set
that
evil
reputation
on
one
*NL*
side
,
as
irreconcilable
with
so
many
unmistakable
proofs
of
his
genuine
*NL*
sincerity
and
refinement
.
For
a
moment
Swann
felt
that
his
mind
was
*NL*
becoming
clouded
,
and
he
thought
of
something
else
so
as
to
recover
*NL*
a
little
light
;
until
he
had
the
courage
to
return
to
those
other
*NL*
reflections
.
But
then
,
after
not
having
been
able
to
suspect
anyone
,
he
*NL*
was
forced
to
suspect
everyone
that
he
knew
.
After
all
,
M.
de
Charlus
*NL*
might
be
most
fond
of
him
,
might
be
most
good-natured
;
but
he
was
a
*NL*
neuropath
;
to-morrow
,
perhaps
,
he
would
burst
into
tears
on
hearing
that
*NL*
Swann
was
ill
;
and
to-day
,
from
jealousy
,
or
in
anger
,
or
carried
away
*NL*
by
some
sudden
idea
,
he
might
have
wished
to
do
him
a
deliberate
injury
.
*NL*
Really
,
that
kind
of
man
was
the
worst
of
all
.
The
Prince
des
Laumes
*NL*
was
,
certainly
,
far
less
devoted
to
Swann
than
was
M.
de
Charlus
.
But
*NL*
for
that
very
reason
he
had
not
the
same
susceptibility
with
regard
to
*NL*
him
;
and
besides
,
his
was
a
nature
which
,
though
,
no
doubt
,
it
was
cold
,
*NL*
was
as
incapable
of
a
base
as
of
a
magnanimous
action
.
Swann
regretted
*NL*
that
he
had
formed
no
attachments
in
his
life
except
to
such
people
.
*NL*
Then
he
reflected
that
what
prevents
men
from
doing
harm
to
their
*NL*
neighbours
is
fellow-feeling
,
that
he
could
not
,
in
the
last
resort
,
*NL*
answer
for
any
but
men
whose
natures
were
analogous
to
his
own
,
as
was
,
*NL*
so
far
as
the
heart
went
,
that
of
M.
de
Charlus
.
The
mere
thought
of
*NL*
causing
Swann
so
much
distress
would
have
been
revolting
to
him
.
But
*NL*
with
a
man
who
was
insensible
,
of
another
order
of
humanity
,
as
was
the
*NL*
Prince
des
Laumes
,
how
was
one
to
foresee
the
actions
to
which
he
might
*NL*
be
led
by
the
promptings
of
a
different
nature
?
To
have
a
good
heart
was
*NL*
everything
,
and
M.
de
Charlus
had
one
.
But
M.
d'Orsan
was
not
lacking
*NL*
in
that
either
,
and
his
relations
with
Swann
--
cordial
,
but
scarcely
*NL*
intimate
,
arising
from
the
pleasure
which
,
as
they
held
the
same
views
*NL*
about
everything
,
they
found
in
talking
together
--
were
more
quiescent
*NL*
than
the
enthusiastic
affection
of
M.
de
Charlus
,
who
was
apt
to
be
*NL*
led
into
passionate
activity
,
good
or
evil
.
If
there
was
anyone
by
*NL*
whom
Swann
felt
that
he
had
always
been
understood
,
and
-LRB-
with
delicacy
-RRB-
*NL*
loved
,
it
was
M.
d'Orsan
.
Yes
,
but
the
life
he
led
;
it
could
hardly
be
*NL*
called
honourable
.
Swann
regretted
that
he
had
never
taken
any
notice
*NL*
of
those
rumours
,
that
he
himself
had
admitted
,
jestingly
,
that
he
had
*NL*
never
felt
so
keen
a
sense
of
sympathy
,
or
of
respect
,
as
when
he
was
*NL*
in
thoroughly
`
detrimental
'
society
.
``
It
is
not
for
nothing
,
''
he
now
*NL*
assured
himself
,
``
that
when
people
pass
judgment
upon
their
neighbour
,
*NL*
their
finding
is
based
upon
his
actions
.
It
is
those
alone
that
are
*NL*
significant
,
and
not
at
all
what
we
say
or
what
we
think
.
Charlus
and
*NL*
des
Laumes
may
have
this
or
that
fault
,
but
they
are
men
of
honour
.
*NL*
Orsan
,
perhaps
,
has
not
the
same
faults
,
but
he
is
not
a
man
of
honour
.
*NL*
He
may
have
acted
dishonourably
once
again
.
''
Then
he
suspected
Rémi
,
*NL*
who
,
it
was
true
,
could
only
have
inspired
the
letter
,
but
he
now
felt
*NL*
himself
,
for
a
moment
,
to
be
on
the
right
track
.
To
begin
with
,
Loredan
*NL*
had
his
own
reasons
for
wishing
harm
to
Odette
.
And
then
,
how
were
we
*NL*
not
to
suppose
that
our
servants
,
living
in
a
situation
inferior
to
our
*NL*
own
,
adding
to
our
fortunes
and
to
our
frailties
imaginary
riches
and
*NL*
vices
for
which
they
at
once
envied
and
despised
us
,
should
not
find
*NL*
themselves
led
by
fate
to
act
in
a
manner
abhorrent
to
people
of
our
own
*NL*
class
?
He
also
suspected
my
grandfather
.
On
every
occasion
when
Swann
*NL*
had
asked
him
to
do
him
any
service
,
had
he
not
invariably
declined
?
*NL*
Besides
,
with
his
ideas
of
middle-class
respectability
,
he
might
have
*NL*
thought
that
he
was
acting
for
Swann
's
good
.
He
suspected
,
in
turn
,
*NL*
Bergotte
,
the
painter
,
the
Verdurins
;
paused
for
a
moment
to
admire
*NL*
once
again
the
wisdom
of
people
in
society
,
who
refused
to
mix
in
the
*NL*
artistic
circles
in
which
such
things
were
possible
,
were
,
perhaps
,
even
*NL*
openly
avowed
,
as
excellent
jokes
;
but
then
he
recalled
the
marks
of
*NL*
honesty
that
were
to
be
observed
in
those
Bohemians
,
and
contrasted
them
*NL*
with
the
life
of
expedients
,
often
bordering
on
fraudulence
,
to
which
*NL*
the
want
of
money
,
the
craving
for
luxury
,
the
corrupting
influence
of
*NL*
their
pleasures
often
drove
members
of
the
aristocracy
.
In
a
word
,
this
*NL*
anonymous
letter
proved
that
he
himself
knew
a
human
being
capable
of
*NL*
the
most
infamous
conduct
,
but
he
could
see
no
reason
why
that
infamy
*NL*
should
lurk
in
the
depths
--
which
no
strange
eye
might
explore
--
of
*NL*
the
warm
heart
rather
than
the
cold
,
the
artist
's
rather
than
the
*NL*
business-man
's
,
the
noble
's
rather
than
the
flunkey
's
.
What
criterion
*NL*
ought
one
to
adopt
,
in
order
to
judge
one
's
fellows
?
After
all
,
there
*NL*
was
not
a
single
one
of
the
people
whom
he
knew
who
might
not
,
in
*NL*
certain
circumstances
,
prove
capable
of
a
shameful
action
.
Must
he
then
*NL*
cease
to
see
them
all
?
His
mind
grew
clouded
;
he
passed
his
hands
two
*NL*
or
three
times
across
his
brow
,
wiped
his
glasses
with
his
handkerchief
,
*NL*
and
remembering
that
,
after
all
,
men
who
were
as
good
as
himself
*NL*
frequented
the
society
of
M.
de
Charlus
,
the
Prince
des
Laumes
and
*NL*
the
rest
,
he
persuaded
himself
that
this
meant
,
if
not
that
they
were
*NL*
incapable
of
shameful
actions
,
at
least
that
it
was
a
necessity
in
human
*NL*
life
,
to
which
everyone
must
submit
,
to
frequent
the
society
of
people
*NL*
who
were
,
perhaps
,
not
incapable
of
such
actions
.
And
he
continued
to
*NL*
shake
hands
with
all
the
friends
whom
he
had
suspected
,
with
the
purely
*NL*
formal
reservation
that
each
one
of
them
had
,
possibly
,
been
seeking
to
*NL*
drive
him
to
despair
.
As
for
the
actual
contents
of
the
letter
,
they
*NL*
did
not
disturb
him
;
for
in
not
one
of
the
charges
which
it
formulated
*NL*
against
Odette
could
he
see
the
least
vestige
of
fact
.
Like
many
other
*NL*
men
,
Swann
had
a
naturally
lazy
mind
,
and
was
slow
in
invention
.
He
knew
*NL*
quite
well
as
a
general
truth
,
that
human
life
is
full
of
contrasts
,
but
*NL*
in
the
case
of
any
one
human
being
he
imagined
all
that
part
of
his
or
*NL*
her
life
with
which
he
was
not
familiar
as
being
identical
with
the
*NL*
part
with
which
he
was
.
He
imagined
what
was
kept
secret
from
him
in
the
*NL*
light
of
what
was
revealed
.
At
such
times
as
he
spent
with
Odette
,
*NL*
if
their
conversation
turned
upon
an
indelicate
act
committed
,
or
*NL*
an
indelicate
sentiment
expressed
by
some
third
person
,
she
would
*NL*
ruthlessly
condemn
the
culprit
by
virtue
of
the
same
moral
principles
*NL*
which
Swann
had
always
heard
expressed
by
his
own
parents
,
and
to
which
*NL*
he
himself
had
remained
loyal
;
and
then
,
she
would
arrange
her
flowers
,
*NL*
would
sip
her
tea
,
would
shew
an
interest
in
his
work
.
So
Swann
extended
*NL*
those
habits
to
fill
the
rest
of
her
life
,
he
reconstructed
those
*NL*
actions
when
he
wished
to
form
a
picture
of
the
moments
in
which
he
and
*NL*
she
were
apart
.
If
anyone
had
portrayed
her
to
him
as
she
was
,
or
rather
*NL*
as
she
had
been
for
so
long
with
himself
,
but
had
substituted
some
*NL*
other
man
,
he
would
have
been
distressed
,
for
such
a
portrait
would
have
*NL*
struck
him
as
lifelike
.
But
to
suppose
that
she
went
to
bad
houses
,
*NL*
that
she
abandoned
herself
to
orgies
with
other
women
,
that
she
led
*NL*
the
crapulous
existence
of
the
most
abject
,
the
most
contemptible
of
*NL*
mortals
--
would
be
an
insane
wandering
of
the
mind
,
for
the
realisation
*NL*
of
which
,
thank
heaven
,
the
chrysanthemums
that
he
could
imagine
,
the
*NL*
daily
cups
of
tea
,
the
virtuous
indignation
left
neither
time
nor
*NL*
place
.
Only
,
now
and
again
,
he
gave
Odette
to
understand
that
people
*NL*
maliciously
kept
him
informed
of
everything
that
she
did
;
and
making
*NL*
opportune
use
of
some
detail
--
insignificant
but
true
--
which
he
had
*NL*
accidentally
learned
,
as
though
it
were
the
sole
fragment
which
he
would
*NL*
allow
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
to
pass
his
lips
,
out
of
the
numberless
*NL*
other
fragments
of
that
complete
reconstruction
of
her
daily
life
which
*NL*
he
carried
secretly
in
his
mind
,
he
led
her
to
suppose
that
he
was
*NL*
perfectly
informed
upon
matters
,
which
,
in
reality
,
he
neither
knew
nor
*NL*
suspected
,
for
if
he
often
adjured
Odette
never
to
swerve
from
or
make
*NL*
alteration
of
the
truth
,
that
was
only
,
whether
he
realised
it
or
no
,
in
*NL*
order
that
Odette
should
tell
him
everything
that
she
did
.
No
doubt
,
as
*NL*
he
used
to
assure
Odette
,
he
loved
sincerity
,
but
only
as
he
might
*NL*
love
a
pander
who
could
keep
him
in
touch
with
the
daily
life
of
his
*NL*
mistress
.
Moreover
,
his
love
of
sincerity
,
not
being
disinterested
,
had
*NL*
not
improved
his
character
.
The
truth
which
he
cherished
was
that
which
*NL*
Odette
would
tell
him
;
but
he
himself
,
in
order
to
extract
that
truth
*NL*
from
her
,
was
not
afraid
to
have
recourse
to
falsehood
,
that
very
*NL*
falsehood
which
he
never
ceased
to
depict
to
Odette
as
leading
every
*NL*
human
creature
down
to
utter
degradation
.
In
a
word
,
he
lied
as
much
*NL*
as
did
Odette
,
because
,
while
more
unhappy
than
she
,
he
was
no
less
*NL*
egotistical
.
And
she
,
when
she
heard
him
repeating
thus
to
her
the
*NL*
things
that
she
had
done
,
would
stare
at
him
with
a
look
of
distrust
*NL*
and
,
at
all
hazards
,
of
indignation
,
so
as
not
to
appear
to
be
*NL*
humiliated
,
and
to
be
blushing
for
her
actions
.
One
day
,
after
the
*NL*
longest
period
of
calm
through
which
he
had
yet
been
able
to
exist
*NL*
without
being
overtaken
by
an
attack
of
jealousy
,
he
had
accepted
an
*NL*
invitation
to
spend
the
evening
at
the
theatre
with
the
Princesse
des
*NL*
Laumes
.
Having
opened
his
newspaper
to
find
out
what
was
being
*NL*
played
,
the
sight
of
the
title
--
_
Les
Filles
de
Marbre
_
,
by
Théodore
*NL*
Barrière
,
--
struck
him
so
cruel
a
blow
that
he
recoiled
instinctively
*NL*
from
it
and
turned
his
head
away
.
Illuminated
,
as
though
by
a
row
of
*NL*
footlights
,
in
the
new
surroundings
in
which
it
now
appeared
,
that
word
*NL*
`
marble
,
'
which
he
had
lost
the
power
to
distinguish
,
so
often
had
it
*NL*
passed
,
in
print
,
beneath
his
eyes
,
had
suddenly
become
visible
once
*NL*
again
,
and
had
at
once
brought
back
to
his
mind
the
story
which
Odette
*NL*
had
told
him
,
long
ago
,
of
a
visit
which
she
had
paid
to
the
Salon
at
*NL*
the
Palais
d'Industrie
with
Mme.
Verdurin
,
who
had
said
to
her
,
``
Take
*NL*
care
,
now
!
I
know
how
to
melt
you
,
all
right
.
You
're
not
made
of
*NL*
marble
.
''
Odette
had
assured
him
that
it
was
only
a
joke
,
and
he
had
*NL*
not
attached
any
importance
to
it
at
the
time
.
But
he
had
had
more
*NL*
confidence
in
her
then
than
he
had
now
.
And
the
anonymous
letter
*NL*
referred
explicitly
to
relations
of
that
sort
.
Without
daring
to
lift
*NL*
his
eyes
to
the
newspaper
,
he
opened
it
,
turned
the
page
so
as
not
to
*NL*
see
again
the
words
,
_
Filles
de
Marbre
_
,
and
began
to
read
mechanically
*NL*
the
news
from
the
provinces
.
There
had
been
a
storm
in
the
Channel
,
*NL*
and
damage
was
reported
from
Dieppe
,
Cabourg
,
Beuzeval
...
Suddenly
he
*NL*
recoiled
again
in
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
Beuzeval
had
suggested
to
him
that
of
another
place
in
the
*NL*
same
district
,
Beuzeville
,
which
carried
also
,
bound
to
it
by
a
hyphen
,
*NL*
a
second
name
,
to
wit
Bréauté
,
which
he
had
often
seen
on
maps
,
but
*NL*
without
ever
previously
remarking
that
it
was
the
same
name
as
that
*NL*
borne
by
his
friend
M.
de
Bréauté
,
whom
the
anonymous
letter
accused
of
*NL*
having
been
Odette
's
lover
.
After
all
,
when
it
came
to
M.
de
Bréauté
,
*NL*
there
was
nothing
improbable
in
the
charge
;
but
so
far
as
Mme.
Verdurin
*NL*
was
concerned
,
it
was
a
sheer
impossibility
.
From
the
fact
that
Odette
*NL*
did
occasionally
tell
a
lie
,
it
was
not
fair
to
conclude
that
she
never
,
*NL*
by
any
chance
,
told
the
truth
,
and
in
these
bantering
conversations
*NL*
with
Mme.
Verdurin
which
she
herself
had
repeated
to
Swann
,
he
could
*NL*
recognize
those
meaningless
and
dangerous
pleasantries
which
,
in
their
*NL*
inexperience
of
life
and
ignorance
of
vice
,
women
often
utter
-LRB-
thereby
*NL*
certifying
their
own
innocence
-RRB-
,
who
--
as
,
for
instance
,
Odette
,
--
would
*NL*
be
the
last
people
in
the
world
to
feel
any
undue
affection
for
one
*NL*
another
.
Whereas
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
indignation
with
which
she
*NL*
had
scattered
the
suspicions
which
she
had
unintentionally
brought
into
*NL*
being
,
for
a
moment
,
in
his
mind
by
her
story
,
fitted
in
with
everything
*NL*
that
he
knew
of
the
tastes
,
the
temperament
of
his
mistress
.
But
at
*NL*
that
moment
,
by
an
inspiration
of
jealousy
,
analogous
to
the
inspiration
*NL*
which
reveals
to
a
poet
or
a
philosopher
,
who
has
nothing
,
so
far
,
but
*NL*
an
odd
pair
of
rhymes
or
a
detached
observation
,
the
idea
or
the
natural
*NL*
law
which
will
give
power
,
mastery
to
his
work
,
Swann
recalled
for
the
*NL*
first
time
a
remark
which
Odette
had
made
to
him
,
at
least
two
years
*NL*
before
:
``
Oh
,
Mme.
Verdurin
,
she
wo
n't
hear
of
anything
just
now
but
me
.
*NL*
I
'm
a
`
love
,
'
if
you
please
,
and
she
kisses
me
,
and
wants
me
to
go
with
*NL*
her
everywhere
,
and
call
her
by
her
Christian
name
.
''
So
far
from
seeing
*NL*
in
these
expressions
any
connection
with
the
absurd
insinuations
,
*NL*
intended
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
vice
,
which
Odette
had
since
*NL*
repeated
to
him
,
he
had
welcomed
them
as
a
proof
of
Mme.
Verdurin
's
*NL*
warm-hearted
and
generous
friendship
.
But
now
this
old
memory
of
her
*NL*
affection
for
Odette
had
coalesced
suddenly
with
his
more
recent
memory
*NL*
of
her
unseemly
conversation
.
He
could
no
longer
separate
them
in
his
*NL*
mind
,
and
he
saw
them
blended
in
reality
,
the
affection
imparting
a
*NL*
certain
seriousness
and
importance
to
the
pleasantries
which
,
in
return
,
*NL*
spoiled
the
affection
of
its
innocence
.
He
went
to
see
Odette
.
He
sat
*NL*
down
,
keeping
at
a
distance
from
her
.
He
did
not
dare
to
embrace
her
,
*NL*
not
knowing
whether
in
her
,
in
himself
,
it
would
be
affection
or
anger
*NL*
that
a
kiss
would
provoke
.
He
sat
there
silent
,
watching
their
love
*NL*
expire
.
Suddenly
he
made
up
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Odette
,
my
darling
,
''
he
began
,
``
I
know
,
I
am
being
simply
odious
,
but
I
*NL*
must
ask
you
a
few
questions
.
You
remember
what
I
once
thought
about
you
*NL*
and
Mme.
Verdurin
?
Tell
me
,
was
it
true
?
Have
you
,
with
her
or
anyone
*NL*
else
,
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
,
pursing
her
lips
together
;
a
sign
which
people
*NL*
commonly
employ
to
signify
that
they
are
not
going
,
because
it
would
*NL*
bore
them
to
go
,
when
some
one
has
asked
,
``
Are
you
coming
to
watch
the
*NL*
procession
go
by
?
''
,
or
``
Will
you
be
at
the
review
?
''
.
But
this
shake
of
*NL*
the
head
,
which
is
thus
commonly
used
to
decline
participation
in
*NL*
an
event
that
has
yet
to
come
,
imparts
for
that
reason
an
element
of
*NL*
uncertainty
to
the
denial
of
participation
in
an
event
that
is
past
.
*NL*
Furthermore
,
it
suggests
reasons
of
personal
convenience
,
rather
than
*NL*
any
definite
repudiation
,
any
moral
impossibility
.
When
he
saw
Odette
*NL*
thus
make
him
a
sign
that
the
insinuation
was
false
,
he
realised
that
it
*NL*
was
quite
possibly
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
told
you
,
I
never
did
;
you
know
quite
well
,
''
she
added
,
seeming
*NL*
angry
and
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
all
that
;
but
are
you
quite
sure
?
Do
n't
say
to
me
,
`
You
*NL*
know
quite
well
'
;
say
,
'
I
have
never
done
anything
of
that
sort
with
any
*NL*
woman
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
repeated
his
words
like
a
lesson
learned
by
rote
,
and
as
though
she
*NL*
hoped
,
thereby
,
to
be
rid
of
him
:
``
I
have
never
done
anything
of
that
*NL*
sort
with
any
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
swear
it
to
me
on
your
Laghetto
medal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
knew
that
Odette
would
never
perjure
herself
on
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
do
make
me
so
miserable
,
''
she
cried
,
with
a
jerk
of
her
body
*NL*
as
though
to
shake
herself
free
of
the
constraint
of
his
question
.
``
Have
*NL*
you
nearly
done
?
What
is
the
matter
with
you
to-day
?
You
seem
to
have
*NL*
made
up
your
mind
that
I
am
to
be
forced
to
hate
you
,
to
curse
you
!
*NL*
Look
,
I
was
anxious
to
be
friends
with
you
again
,
for
us
to
have
a
nice
*NL*
time
together
,
like
the
old
days
;
and
this
is
all
the
thanks
I
get
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
would
not
let
her
go
,
but
sat
there
like
a
surgeon
who
waits
*NL*
for
a
spasm
to
subside
that
has
interrupted
his
operation
but
need
not
*NL*
make
him
abandon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
quite
wrong
in
supposing
that
I
bear
you
the
least
ill-will
in
*NL*
the
world
,
Odette
,
''
he
began
with
a
persuasive
and
deceitful
gentleness
.
*NL*
``
I
never
speak
to
you
except
of
what
I
already
know
,
and
I
always
know
a
*NL*
great
deal
more
than
I
say
.
But
you
alone
can
mollify
by
your
confession
*NL*
what
makes
me
hate
you
so
long
as
it
has
been
reported
to
me
only
by
*NL*
other
people
.
My
anger
with
you
is
never
due
to
your
actions
--
I
can
*NL*
and
do
forgive
you
everything
because
I
love
you
--
but
to
your
*NL*
untruthfulness
,
the
ridiculous
untruthfulness
which
makes
you
persist
in
*NL*
denying
things
which
I
know
to
be
true
.
How
can
you
expect
that
I
shall
*NL*
continue
to
love
you
,
when
I
see
you
maintain
,
when
I
hear
you
swear
to
*NL*
me
a
thing
which
I
know
to
be
false
?
Odette
,
do
not
prolong
this
moment
*NL*
which
is
torturing
us
both
.
If
you
are
willing
to
end
it
at
once
,
you
*NL*
shall
be
free
of
it
for
ever
.
Tell
me
,
upon
your
medal
,
yes
or
no
,
*NL*
whether
you
have
ever
done
those
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
on
earth
can
I
tell
?
''
she
was
furious
.
``
Perhaps
I
have
,
ever
so
*NL*
long
ago
,
when
I
did
n't
know
what
I
was
doing
,
perhaps
two
or
three
*NL*
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
had
prepared
himself
for
all
possibilities
.
Reality
must
,
*NL*
therefore
,
be
something
which
bears
no
relation
to
possibilities
,
*NL*
any
more
than
the
stab
of
a
knife
in
one
's
body
bears
to
the
gradual
*NL*
movement
of
the
clouds
overhead
,
since
those
words
``
two
or
three
times
''
*NL*
carved
,
as
it
were
,
a
cross
upon
the
living
tissues
of
his
heart
.
A
*NL*
strange
thing
,
indeed
,
that
those
words
,
``
two
or
three
times
,
''
nothing
*NL*
more
than
a
few
words
,
words
uttered
in
the
air
,
at
a
distance
,
could
so
*NL*
lacerate
a
man
's
heart
,
as
if
they
had
actually
pierced
it
,
could
sicken
*NL*
a
man
,
like
a
poison
that
he
had
drunk
.
Instinctively
Swann
thought
of
*NL*
the
remark
that
he
had
heard
at
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
:
``
I
have
never
*NL*
seen
anything
to
beat
it
since
the
table-turning
.
''
The
agony
that
he
now
*NL*
suffered
in
no
way
resembled
what
he
had
supposed
.
Not
only
because
,
in
*NL*
the
hours
when
he
most
entirely
mistrusted
her
,
he
had
rarely
imagined
*NL*
such
a
culmination
of
evil
,
but
because
,
even
when
he
did
imagine
that
*NL*
offence
,
it
remained
vague
,
uncertain
,
was
not
clothed
in
the
particular
*NL*
horror
which
had
escaped
with
the
words
``
perhaps
two
or
three
times
,
''
*NL*
was
not
armed
with
that
specific
cruelty
,
as
different
from
anything
*NL*
that
he
had
known
as
a
new
malady
by
which
one
is
attacked
for
the
first
*NL*
time
.
And
yet
this
Odette
,
from
whom
all
this
evil
sprang
,
was
no
less
*NL*
dear
to
him
,
was
,
on
the
contrary
,
more
precious
,
as
if
,
in
proportion
*NL*
as
his
sufferings
increased
,
there
increased
at
the
same
time
the
price
*NL*
of
the
sedative
,
of
the
antidote
which
this
woman
alone
possessed
.
He
*NL*
wished
to
pay
her
more
attention
,
as
one
attends
to
a
disease
which
*NL*
one
discovers
,
suddenly
,
to
have
grown
more
serious
.
He
wished
that
*NL*
the
horrible
thing
which
,
she
had
told
him
,
she
had
done
``
two
or
three
*NL*
times
''
might
be
prevented
from
occurring
again
.
To
ensure
that
,
he
must
*NL*
watch
over
Odette
.
People
often
say
that
,
by
pointing
out
to
a
man
the
*NL*
faults
of
his
mistress
,
you
succeed
only
in
strengthening
his
attachment
*NL*
to
her
,
because
he
does
not
believe
you
;
yet
how
much
more
so
if
he
*NL*
does
!
But
,
Swann
asked
himself
,
how
could
he
manage
to
protect
her
?
He
*NL*
might
perhaps
be
able
to
preserve
her
from
the
contamination
of
any
*NL*
one
woman
,
but
there
were
hundreds
of
other
women
;
and
he
realised
how
*NL*
insane
had
been
his
ambition
when
he
had
begun
-LRB-
on
the
evening
when
*NL*
he
had
failed
to
find
Odette
at
the
Verdurins
'
-RRB-
to
desire
the
*NL*
possession
--
as
if
that
were
ever
possible
--
of
another
person
.
Happily
*NL*
for
Swann
,
beneath
the
mass
of
suffering
which
had
invaded
his
soul
like
*NL*
a
conquering
horde
of
barbarians
,
there
lay
a
natural
foundation
,
older
,
*NL*
more
placid
,
and
silently
laborious
,
like
the
cells
of
an
injured
organ
*NL*
which
at
once
set
to
work
to
repair
the
damaged
tissues
,
or
the
muscles
*NL*
of
a
paralysed
limb
which
tend
to
recover
their
former
movements
.
These
*NL*
older
,
these
autochthonous
in-dwellers
in
his
soul
absorbed
all
Swann
's
*NL*
strength
,
for
a
while
,
in
that
obscure
task
of
reparation
which
gives
*NL*
one
an
illusory
sense
of
repose
during
convalescence
,
or
after
an
*NL*
operation
.
This
time
it
was
not
so
much
--
as
it
ordinarily
was
--
in
*NL*
Swann
's
brain
that
the
slackening
of
tension
due
to
exhaustion
took
*NL*
effect
,
it
was
rather
in
his
heart
.
But
all
the
things
in
life
that
have
*NL*
once
existed
tend
to
recur
,
and
,
like
a
dying
animal
that
is
once
more
*NL*
stirred
by
the
throes
of
a
convulsion
which
was
,
apparently
,
ended
,
upon
*NL*
Swann
's
heart
,
spared
for
a
moment
only
,
the
same
agony
returned
of
its
*NL*
own
accord
to
trace
the
same
cross
again
.
He
remembered
those
moonlit
*NL*
evenings
,
when
,
leaning
back
in
the
victoria
that
was
taking
him
to
*NL*
the
Rue
La
Pérouse
,
he
would
cultivate
with
voluptuous
enjoyment
the
*NL*
emotions
of
a
man
in
love
,
ignorant
of
the
poisoned
fruit
that
such
*NL*
emotions
must
inevitably
bear
.
But
all
those
thoughts
lasted
for
no
more
*NL*
than
a
second
,
the
time
that
it
took
him
to
raise
his
hand
to
his
heart
,
*NL*
to
draw
breath
again
and
to
contrive
to
smile
,
so
as
to
dissemble
*NL*
his
torment
.
Already
he
had
begun
to
put
further
questions
.
For
his
*NL*
jealousy
,
which
had
taken
an
amount
of
trouble
,
such
as
no
enemy
would
*NL*
have
incurred
,
to
strike
him
this
mortal
blow
,
to
make
him
forcibly
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
most
cruel
pain
that
he
had
ever
known
,
his
jealousy
*NL*
was
not
satisfied
that
he
had
yet
suffered
enough
,
and
sought
to
expose
*NL*
his
bosom
to
an
even
deeper
wound
.
Like
an
evil
deity
,
his
jealousy
was
*NL*
inspiring
Swann
,
was
thrusting
him
on
towards
destruction
.
It
was
not
*NL*
his
fault
,
but
Odette
's
alone
,
if
at
first
his
punishment
was
not
more
*NL*
severe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
darling
,
''
he
began
again
,
``
it
's
all
over
now
;
was
it
with
anyone
I
*NL*
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
swear
it
was
n't
;
besides
,
I
think
I
exaggerated
,
I
never
really
*NL*
went
as
far
as
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
,
and
resumed
with
:
``
Just
as
you
like
.
It
does
n't
really
*NL*
matter
,
but
it
's
unfortunate
that
you
ca
n't
give
me
any
name
.
If
I
were
*NL*
able
to
form
an
idea
of
the
person
that
would
prevent
my
ever
thinking
*NL*
of
her
again
.
I
say
it
for
your
own
sake
,
because
then
I
should
n't
*NL*
bother
you
any
more
about
it
.
It
's
so
soothing
to
be
able
to
form
a
*NL*
clear
picture
of
things
in
one
's
mind
.
What
is
really
terrible
is
what
*NL*
one
can
not
imagine
.
But
you
've
been
so
sweet
to
me
;
I
do
n't
want
to
tire
*NL*
you
.
I
do
thank
you
,
with
all
my
heart
,
for
all
the
good
that
you
have
*NL*
done
me
.
I
've
quite
finished
now
.
Only
one
word
more
:
how
many
times
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Charles
!
ca
n't
you
see
,
you
're
killing
me
?
It
's
all
ever
so
long
*NL*
ago
.
I
've
never
given
it
a
thought
.
Anyone
would
say
that
you
were
*NL*
positively
trying
to
put
those
ideas
into
my
head
again
.
And
then
you
'd
*NL*
be
a
lot
better
off
!
''
she
concluded
,
with
unconscious
stupidity
but
with
*NL*
intentional
malice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
wished
to
know
whether
it
had
been
since
I
knew
you
.
It
's
only
*NL*
natural
.
Did
it
happen
here
,
ever
?
You
ca
n't
give
me
any
particular
*NL*
evening
,
so
that
I
can
remind
myself
what
I
was
doing
at
the
time
?
You
*NL*
understand
,
surely
,
that
it
's
not
possible
that
you
do
n't
remember
with
*NL*
whom
,
Odette
,
my
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
know
;
really
,
I
do
n't
.
I
think
it
was
in
the
Bois
,
one
*NL*
evening
when
you
came
to
meet
us
on
the
Island
.
You
had
been
dining
with
*NL*
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
,
''
she
added
,
happy
to
be
able
to
furnish
him
*NL*
with
an
exact
detail
,
which
testified
to
her
veracity
.
``
At
the
next
*NL*
table
there
was
a
woman
whom
I
had
n't
seen
for
ever
so
long
.
She
said
to
*NL*
me
,
`
Come
along
round
behind
the
rock
,
there
,
and
look
at
the
moonlight
*NL*
on
the
water
!
'
At
first
I
just
yawned
,
and
said
,
`
No
,
I
'm
too
tired
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
quite
happy
where
I
am
,
thank
you
.
'
She
swore
there
'd
never
been
*NL*
anything
like
it
in
the
way
of
moonlight
.
`
I
've
heard
that
tale
before
,
'
*NL*
I
said
to
her
;
you
see
,
I
knew
quite
well
what
she
was
after
.
''
Odette
*NL*
narrated
this
episode
almost
as
if
it
were
a
joke
,
either
because
it
*NL*
appeared
to
her
to
be
quite
natural
,
or
because
she
thought
that
she
was
*NL*
thereby
minimising
its
importance
,
or
else
so
as
not
to
appear
ashamed
.
*NL*
But
,
catching
sight
of
Swann
's
face
,
she
changed
her
tone
,
and
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
fiend
!
''
she
flung
at
him
,
``
you
enjoy
tormenting
me
,
making
me
*NL*
tell
you
lies
,
just
so
that
you
'll
leave
me
in
peace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
second
blow
struck
at
Swann
was
even
more
excruciating
than
the
*NL*
first
.
Never
had
he
supposed
it
to
have
been
so
recent
an
affair
,
hidden
*NL*
from
his
eyes
that
had
been
too
innocent
to
discern
it
,
not
in
a
past
*NL*
which
he
had
never
known
,
but
in
evenings
which
he
so
well
remembered
,
*NL*
which
he
had
lived
through
with
Odette
,
of
which
he
had
supposed
himself
*NL*
to
have
such
an
intimate
,
such
an
exhaustive
knowledge
,
and
which
now
*NL*
assumed
,
retrospectively
,
an
aspect
of
cunning
and
deceit
and
cruelty
.
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
them
parted
,
suddenly
,
a
gaping
chasm
,
that
moment
on
*NL*
the
Island
in
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
Without
being
intelligent
,
Odette
*NL*
had
the
charm
of
being
natural
.
She
had
recounted
,
she
had
acted
the
*NL*
little
scene
with
so
much
simplicity
that
Swann
,
as
he
gasped
for
*NL*
breath
,
could
vividly
see
it
:
Odette
yawning
,
the
``
rock
there
,
''
...
He
*NL*
could
hear
her
answer
--
alas
,
how
lightheartedly
--
``
I
've
heard
that
tale
*NL*
before
!
''
He
felt
that
she
would
tell
him
nothing
more
that
evening
,
that
*NL*
no
further
revelation
was
to
be
expected
for
the
present
.
He
was
silent
*NL*
for
a
time
,
then
said
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
darling
,
you
must
forgive
me
;
I
know
,
I
am
hurting
you
*NL*
dreadfully
,
but
it
's
all
over
now
;
I
shall
never
think
of
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
saw
that
his
eyes
remained
fixed
upon
the
things
that
he
did
not
*NL*
know
,
and
on
that
past
era
of
their
love
,
monotonous
and
soothing
in
his
*NL*
memory
because
it
was
vague
,
and
now
rent
,
as
with
a
sword-wound
,
by
the
*NL*
news
of
that
minute
on
the
Island
in
the
Bois
,
by
moonlight
,
while
he
*NL*
was
dining
with
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
.
But
he
had
so
far
acquired
*NL*
the
habit
of
finding
life
interesting
--
of
marvelling
at
the
strange
*NL*
discoveries
that
there
were
to
be
made
in
it
--
that
even
while
he
was
*NL*
suffering
so
acutely
that
he
did
not
believe
it
possible
to
endure
such
*NL*
agony
for
any
length
of
time
,
he
was
saying
to
himself
:
``
Life
is
indeed
*NL*
astonishing
,
and
holds
some
fine
surprises
;
it
appears
that
vice
is
far
*NL*
more
common
than
one
has
been
led
to
believe
.
Here
is
a
woman
in
whom
*NL*
I
had
absolute
confidence
,
who
looks
so
simple
,
so
honest
,
who
,
in
any
*NL*
case
,
even
allowing
that
her
morals
are
not
strict
,
seemed
quite
normal
*NL*
and
healthy
in
her
tastes
and
inclinations
.
I
receive
a
most
improbable
*NL*
accusation
,
I
question
her
,
and
the
little
that
she
admits
reveals
far
*NL*
more
than
I
could
ever
have
suspected
.
''
But
he
could
not
confine
himself
*NL*
to
these
detached
observations
.
He
sought
to
form
an
exact
estimate
of
*NL*
the
importance
of
what
she
had
just
told
him
,
so
as
to
know
whether
he
*NL*
might
conclude
that
she
had
done
these
things
often
,
and
was
likely
to
*NL*
do
them
again
.
He
repeated
her
words
to
himself
:
``
I
knew
quite
well
what
*NL*
she
was
after
.
''
``
Two
or
three
times
.
''
``
I
've
heard
that
tale
before
.
''
But
*NL*
they
did
not
reappear
in
his
memory
unarmed
;
each
of
them
held
a
knife
*NL*
with
which
it
stabbed
him
afresh
.
For
a
long
time
,
like
a
sick
man
*NL*
who
can
not
restrain
himself
from
attempting
,
every
minute
,
to
make
the
*NL*
movement
that
,
he
knows
,
will
hurt
him
,
he
kept
on
murmuring
to
himself
:
*NL*
``
I
'm
quite
happy
where
I
am
,
thank
you
,
''
``
I
've
heard
that
tale
before
,
''
*NL*
but
the
pain
was
so
intense
that
he
was
obliged
to
stop
.
He
was
amazed
*NL*
to
find
that
actions
which
he
had
always
,
hitherto
,
judged
so
lightly
,
*NL*
had
dismissed
,
indeed
,
with
a
laugh
,
should
have
become
as
serious
to
*NL*
him
as
a
disease
which
might
easily
prove
fatal
.
He
knew
any
number
*NL*
of
women
whom
he
could
ask
to
keep
an
eye
on
Odette
,
but
how
was
he
to
*NL*
expect
them
to
adjust
themselves
to
his
new
point
of
view
,
and
not
to
*NL*
remain
at
that
which
for
so
long
had
been
his
own
,
which
had
always
*NL*
guided
him
in
his
voluptuous
existence
;
not
to
say
to
him
with
a
smile
:
*NL*
``
You
jealous
monster
,
wanting
to
rob
other
people
of
their
pleasure
!
''
*NL*
By
what
trap-door
,
suddenly
lowered
,
had
he
-LRB-
who
had
never
found
,
in
the
*NL*
old
days
,
in
his
love
for
Odette
,
any
but
the
most
refined
of
pleasures
-RRB-
*NL*
been
precipitated
into
this
new
circle
of
hell
from
which
he
could
not
*NL*
see
how
he
was
ever
to
escape
.
Poor
Odette
!
He
wished
her
no
harm
.
She
*NL*
was
but
half
to
blame
.
Had
he
not
been
told
that
it
was
her
own
mother
*NL*
who
had
sold
her
,
when
she
was
still
little
more
than
a
child
,
at
Nice
,
*NL*
to
a
wealthy
Englishman
?
But
what
an
agonising
truth
was
now
contained
*NL*
for
him
in
those
lines
of
Alfred
de
Vigny
's
_
Journal
d'un
Poète
_
which
*NL*
he
had
previously
read
without
emotion
:
``
When
one
feels
oneself
smitten
*NL*
by
love
for
a
woman
,
one
ought
to
say
to
oneself
,
`
What
are
`
her
*NL*
surroundings
?
What
has
been
her
life
?
'
All
one
's
future
happiness
lies
*NL*
in
the
answer
.
''
Swann
was
astonished
that
such
simple
phrases
,
spelt
*NL*
over
in
his
mind
as
,
``
I
've
heard
that
tale
before
,
''
or
``
I
knew
quite
*NL*
well
what
she
was
after
,
''
could
cause
him
so
much
pain
.
But
he
realised
*NL*
that
what
he
had
mistaken
for
simple
phrases
were
indeed
parts
of
the
*NL*
panoply
which
held
and
could
inflict
on
him
the
anguish
that
he
had
felt
*NL*
while
Odette
was
telling
her
story
.
For
it
was
the
same
anguish
that
he
*NL*
now
was
feeling
afresh
.
It
was
no
good
,
his
knowing
now
,
--
indeed
,
it
*NL*
was
no
good
,
as
time
went
on
,
his
having
partly
forgotten
and
altogether
*NL*
forgiven
the
offence
--
whenever
he
repeated
her
words
his
old
anguish
*NL*
refashioned
him
as
he
had
been
before
Odette
began
to
speak
:
ignorant
,
*NL*
trustful
;
his
merciless
jealousy
placed
him
once
again
,
so
that
he
might
*NL*
be
effectively
wounded
by
Odette
's
admission
,
in
the
position
of
a
man
*NL*
who
does
not
yet
know
the
truth
;
and
after
several
months
this
old
story
*NL*
would
still
dumbfounder
him
,
like
a
sudden
revelation
.
He
marvelled
*NL*
at
the
terrible
recreative
power
of
his
memory
.
It
was
only
by
the
*NL*
weakening
of
that
generative
force
,
whose
fecundity
diminishes
as
age
*NL*
creeps
over
one
,
that
he
could
hope
for
a
relaxation
of
his
torments
.
*NL*
But
,
as
soon
as
the
power
that
any
one
of
Odette
's
sentences
had
to
make
*NL*
Swann
suffer
seemed
to
be
nearly
exhausted
,
lo
and
behold
another
,
one
*NL*
of
those
to
which
he
had
hitherto
paid
least
attention
,
almost
a
*NL*
new
sentence
,
came
to
relieve
the
first
,
and
to
strike
at
him
with
*NL*
undiminished
force
.
The
memory
of
the
evening
on
which
he
had
dined
with
*NL*
the
Princesse
des
Laumes
was
painful
to
him
,
but
it
was
no
more
than
*NL*
the
centre
,
the
core
of
his
pain
.
That
radiated
vaguely
round
about
it
,
*NL*
overflowing
into
all
the
preceding
and
following
days
.
And
on
whatever
*NL*
point
in
it
he
might
intend
his
memory
to
rest
,
it
was
the
whole
of
that
*NL*
season
,
during
which
the
Verdurins
had
so
often
gone
to
dine
upon
the
*NL*
Island
in
the
Bois
,
that
sprang
back
to
hurt
him
.
So
violently
,
that
by
*NL*
slow
degrees
the
curiosity
which
his
jealousy
was
ever
exciting
in
him
*NL*
was
neutralised
by
his
fear
of
the
fresh
tortures
which
he
would
be
*NL*
inflicting
upon
himself
were
he
to
satisfy
it
.
He
recognised
that
all
*NL*
the
period
of
Odette
's
life
which
had
elapsed
before
she
first
met
him
,
*NL*
a
period
of
which
he
had
never
sought
to
form
any
picture
in
his
mind
,
*NL*
was
not
the
featureless
abstraction
which
he
could
vaguely
see
,
but
had
*NL*
consisted
of
so
many
definite
,
dated
years
,
each
crowded
with
concrete
*NL*
incidents
.
But
were
he
to
learn
more
of
them
,
he
feared
lest
her
past
,
*NL*
now
colourless
,
fluid
and
supportable
,
might
assume
a
tangible
,
an
*NL*
obscene
form
,
with
individual
and
diabolical
features
.
And
he
continued
*NL*
to
refrain
from
seeking
a
conception
of
it
,
not
any
longer
now
from
*NL*
laziness
of
mind
,
but
from
fear
of
suffering
.
He
hoped
that
,
some
day
,
*NL*
he
might
be
able
to
hear
the
Island
in
the
Bois
,
or
the
Princesse
des
*NL*
Laumes
mentioned
without
feeling
any
twinge
of
that
old
rending
pain
;
*NL*
meanwhile
he
thought
it
imprudent
to
provoke
Odette
into
furnishing
him
*NL*
with
fresh
sentences
,
with
the
names
of
more
places
and
people
and
of
*NL*
different
events
,
which
,
when
his
malady
was
still
scarcely
healed
,
*NL*
would
make
it
break
out
again
in
another
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
often
enough
,
the
things
that
he
did
not
know
,
that
he
dreaded
,
*NL*
now
,
to
learn
,
it
was
Odette
herself
who
,
spontaneously
and
without
*NL*
thought
of
what
she
did
,
revealed
them
to
him
;
for
the
gap
which
her
*NL*
vices
made
between
her
actual
life
and
the
comparatively
innocent
life
*NL*
which
Swann
had
believed
,
and
often
still
believed
his
mistress
to
lead
,
*NL*
was
far
wider
than
she
knew
.
A
vicious
person
,
always
affecting
the
same
*NL*
air
of
virtue
before
people
whom
he
is
anxious
to
keep
from
having
any
*NL*
suspicion
of
his
vices
,
has
no
register
,
no
gauge
at
hand
from
which
*NL*
he
may
ascertain
how
far
those
vices
-LRB-
their
continuous
growth
being
*NL*
imperceptible
by
himself
-RRB-
have
gradually
segregated
him
from
the
normal
*NL*
ways
of
life
.
In
the
course
of
their
cohabitation
,
in
Odette
's
mind
,
*NL*
with
the
memory
of
those
of
her
actions
which
she
concealed
from
Swann
,
*NL*
her
other
,
her
innocuous
actions
were
gradually
coloured
,
infected
*NL*
by
these
,
without
her
being
able
to
detect
anything
strange
in
them
,
*NL*
without
their
causing
any
explosion
in
the
particular
region
of
herself
*NL*
in
which
she
made
them
live
,
but
when
she
related
them
to
Swann
,
he
was
*NL*
overwhelmed
by
the
revelation
of
the
duplicity
to
which
they
pointed
.
*NL*
One
day
,
he
was
trying
--
without
hurting
Odette
--
to
discover
from
her
*NL*
whether
she
had
ever
had
any
dealings
with
procuresses
.
He
was
,
as
a
*NL*
matter
of
fact
,
convinced
that
she
had
not
;
the
anonymous
letter
had
*NL*
put
the
idea
into
his
mind
,
but
in
a
purely
mechanical
way
;
it
had
been
*NL*
received
there
with
no
credulity
,
but
it
had
,
for
all
that
,
remained
*NL*
there
,
and
Swann
,
wishing
to
be
rid
of
the
burden
--
a
dead
weight
,
but
*NL*
none
the
less
disturbing
--
of
this
suspicion
,
hoped
that
Odette
would
now
*NL*
extirpate
it
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no
!
Not
that
they
do
n't
simply
persecute
me
to
go
to
them
,
''
*NL*
her
smile
revealed
a
gratified
vanity
which
she
no
longer
saw
that
it
*NL*
was
impossible
should
appear
legitimate
to
Swann
.
``
There
was
one
of
them
*NL*
waited
more
than
two
hours
for
me
yesterday
,
said
she
would
give
me
any
*NL*
money
I
asked
.
It
seems
,
there
's
an
Ambassador
who
said
to
her
,
`
I
'll
*NL*
kill
myself
if
you
do
n't
bring
her
to
me
'
--
meaning
me
!
They
told
her
I
'd
*NL*
gone
out
,
but
she
waited
and
waited
,
and
in
the
end
I
had
to
go
myself
*NL*
and
speak
to
her
,
before
she
'd
go
away
.
I
do
wish
you
could
have
seen
*NL*
the
way
I
tackled
her
;
my
maid
was
in
the
next
room
,
listening
,
and
told
*NL*
me
I
shouted
fit
to
bring
the
house
down
:
--
`
But
when
you
hear
me
say
*NL*
that
I
do
n't
want
to
!
The
idea
of
such
a
thing
,
I
do
n't
like
it
at
all
!
*NL*
I
should
hope
I
'm
still
free
to
do
as
I
please
and
when
I
please
and
*NL*
where
I
please
!
If
I
needed
the
money
,
I
could
understand
...
'
The
porter
*NL*
has
orders
not
to
let
her
in
again
;
he
will
tell
her
that
I
am
out
of
*NL*
town
.
Oh
,
I
do
wish
I
could
have
had
you
hidden
somewhere
in
the
room
*NL*
while
I
was
talking
to
her
.
I
know
,
you
'd
have
been
pleased
,
my
dear
.
*NL*
There
's
some
good
in
your
little
Odette
,
you
see
,
after
all
,
though
*NL*
people
do
say
such
dreadful
things
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
her
very
admissions
--
when
she
made
any
--
of
faults
which
she
*NL*
supposed
him
to
have
discovered
,
rather
served
Swann
as
a
starting-point
*NL*
for
fresh
doubts
than
they
put
an
end
to
the
old
.
For
her
admissions
*NL*
never
exactly
coincided
with
his
doubts
.
In
vain
might
Odette
expurgate
*NL*
her
confession
of
all
its
essential
part
,
there
would
remain
in
the
*NL*
accessories
something
which
Swann
had
never
yet
imagined
,
which
crushed
*NL*
him
anew
,
and
was
to
enable
him
to
alter
the
terms
of
the
problem
of
his
*NL*
jealousy
.
And
these
admissions
he
could
never
forget
.
His
spirit
carried
*NL*
them
along
,
cast
them
aside
,
then
cradled
them
again
in
its
bosom
,
like
*NL*
corpses
in
a
river
.
And
they
poisoned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
to
him
once
of
a
visit
that
Forcheville
had
paid
her
on
the
*NL*
day
of
the
Paris-Murcie
Fête
.
``
What
!
you
knew
him
as
long
ago
as
that
?
*NL*
Oh
,
yes
,
of
course
you
did
,
''
he
corrected
himself
,
so
as
not
to
shew
*NL*
that
he
had
been
ignorant
of
the
fact
.
And
suddenly
he
began
to
tremble
*NL*
at
the
thought
that
,
on
the
day
of
the
Paris-Murcie
Fête
,
when
he
had
*NL*
received
that
letter
which
he
had
so
carefully
preserved
,
she
had
been
*NL*
having
luncheon
,
perhaps
,
with
Forcheville
at
the
Maison
d'Or
.
She
swore
*NL*
that
she
had
not
.
``
Still
,
the
Maison
d'Or
reminds
me
of
something
or
*NL*
other
which
,
I
knew
at
the
time
,
was
n't
true
,
''
he
pursued
,
hoping
to
*NL*
frighten
her
.
``
Yes
that
I
had
n't
been
there
at
all
that
evening
when
I
*NL*
told
you
I
had
just
come
from
there
,
and
you
had
been
looking
for
me
*NL*
at
Prévost
's
,
''
she
replied
-LRB-
judging
by
his
manner
that
he
knew
-RRB-
with
a
*NL*
firmness
that
was
based
not
so
much
upon
cynicism
as
upon
timidity
,
a
*NL*
fear
of
crossing
Swann
,
which
her
own
self-respect
made
her
anxious
to
*NL*
conceal
,
and
a
desire
to
shew
him
that
she
could
be
perfectly
frank
if
*NL*
she
chose
.
And
so
she
struck
him
with
all
the
sharpness
and
force
of
a
*NL*
headsman
wielding
his
axe
,
and
yet
could
not
be
charged
with
cruelty
,
*NL*
since
she
was
quite
unconscious
of
hurting
him
;
she
even
began
to
laugh
,
*NL*
though
this
may
perhaps
,
it
is
true
,
have
been
chiefly
to
keep
him
from
*NL*
thinking
that
she
was
ashamed
,
at
all
,
or
confused
.
``
It
's
quite
true
,
I
*NL*
had
n't
been
to
the
Maison
Dorée
.
I
was
coming
away
from
Forcheville
's
.
I
*NL*
had
,
really
,
been
to
Prévost
's
--
that
was
n't
a
story
--
and
he
met
me
there
*NL*
and
asked
me
to
come
in
and
look
at
his
prints
.
But
some
one
else
came
*NL*
to
see
him
.
I
told
you
that
I
was
coming
from
the
Maison
d'Or
because
I
*NL*
was
afraid
you
might
be
angry
with
me
.
It
was
rather
nice
of
me
,
really
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
see
?
I
admit
,
I
did
wrong
,
but
at
least
I
'm
telling
you
all
*NL*
about
it
now
,
a
'n'
t
I
?
What
have
I
to
gain
by
not
telling
you
,
straight
,
*NL*
that
I
lunched
with
him
on
the
day
of
the
Paris-Murcie
Fête
,
if
it
were
*NL*
true
?
Especially
as
at
that
time
we
did
n't
know
one
another
quite
so
*NL*
well
as
we
do
now
,
did
we
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
back
at
her
with
the
sudden
,
craven
weakness
of
the
utterly
*NL*
spiritless
creature
which
these
crushing
words
had
made
of
him
.
And
so
,
*NL*
even
in
the
months
of
which
he
had
never
dared
to
think
again
,
because
*NL*
they
had
been
too
happy
,
in
those
months
when
she
had
loved
him
,
she
was
*NL*
already
lying
to
him
!
Besides
that
moment
-LRB-
that
first
evening
on
which
*NL*
they
had
``
done
a
cattleya
''
-RRB-
when
she
had
told
him
that
she
was
coming
*NL*
from
the
Maison
Dorée
,
how
many
others
must
there
have
been
,
each
*NL*
of
them
covering
a
falsehood
of
which
Swann
had
had
no
suspicion
.
He
*NL*
recalled
how
she
had
said
to
him
once
:
``
I
need
only
tell
Mme.
Verdurin
*NL*
that
my
dress
was
n't
ready
,
or
that
my
cab
came
late
.
There
is
always
*NL*
some
excuse
.
''
From
himself
too
,
probably
,
many
times
when
she
had
glibly
*NL*
uttered
such
words
as
explain
a
delay
or
justify
an
alteration
of
the
*NL*
hour
fixed
for
a
meeting
,
those
moments
must
have
hidden
,
without
his
*NL*
having
the
least
inkling
of
it
at
the
time
,
an
engagement
that
she
had
*NL*
had
with
some
other
man
,
some
man
to
whom
she
had
said
:
``
I
need
only
*NL*
tell
Swann
that
my
dress
was
n't
ready
,
or
that
my
cab
came
late
.
There
*NL*
is
always
some
excuse
.
''
And
beneath
all
his
most
pleasant
memories
,
*NL*
beneath
the
simplest
words
that
Odette
had
ever
spoken
to
him
in
those
*NL*
old
days
,
words
which
he
had
believed
as
though
they
were
the
words
of
*NL*
a
Gospel
,
beneath
her
daily
actions
which
she
had
recounted
to
him
,
*NL*
beneath
the
most
ordinary
places
,
her
dressmaker
's
flat
,
the
Avenue
du
*NL*
Bois
,
the
Hippodrome
,
he
could
feel
-LRB-
dissembled
there
,
by
virtue
of
that
*NL*
temporal
superfluity
which
,
after
the
most
detailed
account
of
how
a
day
*NL*
has
been
spent
,
always
leaves
something
over
,
that
may
serve
as
a
hiding
*NL*
place
for
certain
unconfessed
actions
-RRB-
,
he
could
feel
the
insinuation
of
*NL*
a
possible
undercurrent
of
falsehood
which
debased
for
him
all
that
*NL*
had
remained
most
precious
,
his
happiest
evenings
,
the
Rue
La
Pérouse
*NL*
itself
,
which
Odette
must
constantly
have
been
leaving
at
other
hours
*NL*
than
those
of
which
she
told
him
;
extending
the
power
of
the
dark
horror
*NL*
that
had
gripped
him
when
he
had
heard
her
admission
with
regard
to
*NL*
the
Maison
Dorée
,
and
,
like
the
obscene
creatures
in
the
`
Desolation
of
*NL*
Nineveh
,
'
shattering
,
stone
by
stone
,
the
whole
edifice
of
his
past
...
*NL*
If
,
now
,
he
turned
aside
whenever
his
memory
repeated
the
cruel
name
of
*NL*
the
Maison
Dorée
it
was
because
that
name
recalled
to
him
,
no
longer
,
*NL*
as
,
such
a
little
time
since
,
at
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
party
,
the
good
*NL*
fortune
which
he
long
had
lost
,
but
a
misfortune
of
which
he
was
now
*NL*
first
aware
.
Then
it
befell
the
Maison
Dorée
,
as
it
had
befallen
the
*NL*
Island
in
the
Bois
,
that
gradually
its
name
ceased
to
trouble
him
.
*NL*
For
what
we
suppose
to
be
our
love
,
our
jealousy
are
,
neither
of
them
,
*NL*
single
,
continuous
and
individual
passions
.
They
are
composed
of
an
*NL*
infinity
of
successive
loves
,
of
different
jealousies
,
each
of
which
is
*NL*
ephemeral
,
although
by
their
uninterrupted
multitude
they
give
us
the
*NL*
impression
of
continuity
,
the
illusion
of
unity
.
The
life
of
Swann
's
*NL*
love
,
the
fidelity
of
his
jealousy
,
were
formed
out
of
death
,
of
*NL*
infidelity
,
of
innumerable
desires
,
innumerable
doubts
,
all
of
which
*NL*
had
Odette
for
their
object
.
If
he
had
remained
for
any
length
of
time
*NL*
without
seeing
her
,
those
that
died
would
not
have
been
replaced
by
*NL*
others
.
But
the
presence
of
Odette
continued
to
sow
in
Swann
's
heart
*NL*
alternate
seeds
of
love
and
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
certain
evenings
she
would
suddenly
resume
towards
him
a
kindness
of
*NL*
which
she
would
warn
him
sternly
that
he
must
take
immediate
advantage
,
*NL*
under
penalty
of
not
seeing
it
repeated
for
years
to
come
;
he
must
*NL*
instantly
accompany
her
home
,
to
``
do
a
cattleya
,
''
and
the
desire
*NL*
which
she
pretended
to
have
for
him
was
so
sudden
,
so
inexplicable
,
so
*NL*
imperious
,
the
kisses
which
she
lavished
on
him
were
so
demonstrative
*NL*
and
so
unfamiliar
,
that
this
brutal
and
unnatural
fondness
made
Swann
*NL*
just
as
unhappy
as
any
lie
or
unkind
action
.
One
evening
when
he
had
*NL*
thus
,
in
obedience
to
her
command
,
gone
home
with
her
,
and
while
she
was
*NL*
interspersing
her
kisses
with
passionate
words
,
in
strange
contrast
to
*NL*
her
habitual
coldness
,
he
thought
suddenly
that
he
heard
a
sound
;
he
*NL*
rose
,
searched
everywhere
and
found
nobody
,
but
he
had
not
the
courage
*NL*
to
return
to
his
place
by
her
side
;
whereupon
she
,
in
a
towering
*NL*
rage
,
broke
a
vase
,
with
``
I
never
can
do
anything
right
with
you
,
*NL*
you
impossible
person
!
''
And
he
was
left
uncertain
whether
she
had
not
*NL*
actually
had
some
man
concealed
in
the
room
,
whose
jealousy
she
had
*NL*
wished
to
wound
,
or
else
to
inflame
his
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
repaired
to
`
gay
'
houses
,
hoping
to
learn
something
about
*NL*
Odette
,
although
he
dared
not
mention
her
name
.
``
I
have
a
little
thing
*NL*
here
,
you
're
sure
to
like
,
''
the
`
manageress
'
would
greet
him
,
and
he
*NL*
would
stay
for
an
hour
or
so
,
talking
dolefully
to
some
poor
girl
who
*NL*
sat
there
astonished
that
he
went
no
further
.
One
of
them
,
who
was
still
*NL*
quite
young
and
attractive
,
said
to
him
once
,
``
Of
course
,
what
I
should
*NL*
like
would
be
to
find
a
real
friend
,
then
he
might
be
quite
certain
,
*NL*
I
should
never
go
with
any
other
men
again
.
''
``
Indeed
,
do
you
think
it
*NL*
possible
for
a
woman
really
to
be
touched
by
a
man
's
being
in
love
with
*NL*
her
,
and
never
to
be
unfaithful
to
him
?
''
asked
Swann
anxiously
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
surely
!
It
all
depends
on
their
characters
!
''
Swann
could
not
help
making
*NL*
the
same
remarks
to
these
girls
as
would
have
delighted
the
Princesse
*NL*
des
Laumes
.
To
the
one
who
was
in
search
of
a
friend
he
said
,
with
a
*NL*
smile
:
``
But
how
nice
of
you
,
you
've
put
on
blue
eyes
,
to
go
with
*NL*
your
sash
.
''
``
And
you
too
,
you
've
got
blue
cuffs
on
.
''
``
What
a
charming
*NL*
conversation
we
are
having
,
for
a
place
of
this
sort
!
I
'm
not
boring
*NL*
you
,
am
I
;
or
keeping
you
?
''
``
No
,
I
've
nothing
to
do
,
thank
you
.
If
you
*NL*
bored
me
I
should
say
so
.
But
I
love
hearing
you
talk
.
''
``
I
am
highly
*NL*
flattered
...
Are
n't
we
behaving
prettily
?
''
he
asked
the
`
manageress
,
'
*NL*
who
had
just
looked
in
.
``
Why
,
yes
,
that
's
just
what
I
was
saying
to
*NL*
myself
,
how
sensibly
they
're
behaving
!
But
that
's
how
it
is
!
People
come
*NL*
to
my
house
now
,
just
to
talk
.
The
Prince
was
telling
me
,
only
the
other
*NL*
day
,
that
he
's
far
more
comfortable
here
than
with
his
wife
.
It
seems
*NL*
that
,
nowadays
,
all
the
society
ladies
are
like
that
;
a
perfect
scandal
,
*NL*
I
call
it
.
But
I
'll
leave
you
in
peace
now
,
I
know
when
I
'm
not
wanted
,
''
*NL*
she
ended
discreetly
,
and
left
Swann
with
the
girl
who
had
the
blue
*NL*
eyes
.
But
presently
he
rose
and
said
good-bye
to
her
.
She
had
ceased
to
*NL*
interest
him
.
She
did
not
know
Odette
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
having
been
ill
,
Dr.
Cottard
recommended
a
sea-voyage
;
*NL*
several
of
the
`
faithful
'
spoke
of
accompanying
him
;
the
Verdurins
could
*NL*
not
face
the
prospect
of
being
left
alone
in
Paris
,
so
first
of
all
*NL*
hired
,
and
finally
purchased
a
yacht
;
thus
Odette
was
constantly
going
*NL*
on
a
cruise
.
Whenever
she
had
been
away
for
any
length
of
time
,
Swann
*NL*
would
feel
that
he
was
beginning
to
detach
himself
from
her
,
but
,
as
*NL*
though
this
moral
distance
were
proportionate
to
the
physical
distance
*NL*
between
them
,
whenever
he
heard
that
Odette
had
returned
to
Paris
,
he
*NL*
could
not
rest
without
seeing
her
.
Once
,
when
they
had
gone
away
,
as
*NL*
everyone
thought
,
for
a
month
only
,
either
they
succumbed
to
a
series
*NL*
of
temptations
,
or
else
M.
Verdurin
had
cunningly
arranged
everything
*NL*
beforehand
,
to
please
his
wife
,
and
disclosed
his
plans
to
the
*NL*
`
faithful
'
only
as
time
went
on
;
anyhow
,
from
Algiers
they
flitted
to
*NL*
Tunis
;
then
to
Italy
,
Greece
,
Constantinople
,
Asia
Minor
.
They
had
been
*NL*
absent
for
nearly
a
year
,
and
Swann
felt
perfectly
at
ease
and
almost
*NL*
happy
.
Albeit
M.
Verdurin
had
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
pianist
and
*NL*
Dr.
Cottard
that
their
respective
aunt
and
patients
had
no
need
of
them
,
*NL*
and
that
,
in
any
event
,
it
was
most
rash
to
allow
Mme.
Cottard
to
return
*NL*
to
Paris
,
where
,
Mme.
Verdurin
assured
him
,
a
revolution
had
just
broken
*NL*
out
,
he
was
obliged
to
grant
them
their
liberty
at
Constantinople
.
And
*NL*
the
painter
came
home
with
them
.
One
day
,
shortly
after
the
return
of
*NL*
these
four
travellers
,
Swann
,
seeing
an
omnibus
approach
him
,
labelled
*NL*
`
Luxembourg
,
'
and
having
some
business
there
,
had
jumped
on
to
it
and
*NL*
had
found
himself
sitting
opposite
Mme.
Cottard
,
who
was
paying
a
round
*NL*
of
visits
to
people
whose
`
day
'
it
was
,
in
full
review
order
,
with
a
*NL*
plume
in
her
hat
,
a
silk
dress
,
a
muff
,
an
umbrella
-LRB-
which
do
for
a
*NL*
parasol
if
the
rain
kept
off
-RRB-
,
a
card-case
,
and
a
pair
of
white
gloves
*NL*
fresh
from
the
cleaners
.
Wearing
these
badges
of
rank
,
she
would
,
*NL*
in
fine
weather
,
go
on
foot
from
one
house
to
another
in
the
same
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
but
when
she
had
to
proceed
to
another
district
,
would
*NL*
make
use
of
a
transfer-ticket
on
the
omnibus
.
For
the
first
minute
or
*NL*
two
,
until
the
natural
courtesy
of
the
woman
broke
through
the
starched
*NL*
surface
of
the
doctor
's
-
wife
,
not
being
certain
,
either
,
whether
*NL*
she
ought
to
mention
the
Verdurins
before
Swann
,
she
produced
,
quite
*NL*
naturally
,
in
her
slow
and
awkward
,
but
not
unattractive
voice
,
which
,
*NL*
every
now
and
then
,
was
completely
drowned
by
the
rattling
of
the
*NL*
omnibus
,
topics
selected
from
those
which
she
had
picked
up
and
would
*NL*
repeat
in
each
of
the
score
of
houses
up
the
stairs
of
which
she
*NL*
clambered
in
the
course
of
an
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
n't
ask
you
,
M.
Swann
,
whether
a
man
so
much
in
the
movement
as
*NL*
yourself
has
been
to
the
Mirlitons
,
to
see
the
portrait
by
Machard
that
*NL*
the
whole
of
Paris
is
running
after
.
Well
,
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
*NL*
Whose
camp
are
you
in
,
those
who
bless
or
those
who
curse
?
It
's
the
*NL*
same
in
every
house
in
Paris
now
,
no
one
will
speak
of
anything
else
but
*NL*
Machard
's
portrait
;
you
are
n't
smart
,
you
are
n't
really
cultured
,
you
*NL*
are
n't
up-to-date
unless
you
give
an
opinion
on
Machard
's
portrait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
having
replied
that
he
had
not
seen
this
portrait
,
Mme.
Cottard
*NL*
was
afraid
that
she
might
have
hurt
his
feelings
by
obliging
him
to
*NL*
confess
the
omission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
quite
all
right
!
At
least
you
have
the
courage
to
be
quite
*NL*
frank
about
it
.
You
do
n't
consider
yourself
disgraced
because
you
*NL*
have
n't
seen
Machard
's
portrait
.
I
do
think
that
so
nice
of
you
.
Well
*NL*
now
,
I
have
seen
it
;
opinion
is
divided
,
you
know
,
there
are
some
people
*NL*
who
find
it
rather
laboured
,
like
whipped
cream
,
they
say
;
but
I
think
*NL*
it
's
just
ideal
.
Of
course
,
she
's
not
a
bit
like
the
blue
and
yellow
*NL*
ladies
that
our
friend
Biche
paints
.
That
's
quite
clear
.
But
I
must
tell
*NL*
you
,
perfectly
frankly
-LRB-
you
'll
think
me
dreadfully
old-fashioned
,
but
I
*NL*
always
say
just
what
I
think
-RRB-
,
that
I
do
n't
understand
his
work
.
I
can
*NL*
quite
see
the
good
points
there
are
in
his
portrait
of
my
husband
;
oh
,
*NL*
dear
me
,
yes
;
and
it
's
certainly
less
odd
than
most
of
what
he
does
,
*NL*
but
even
then
he
had
to
give
the
poor
man
a
blue
moustache
!
But
Machard
!
*NL*
Just
listen
to
this
now
,
the
husband
of
my
friend
,
I
am
on
my
way
to
see
*NL*
at
this
very
moment
-LRB-
which
has
given
me
the
very
great
pleasure
of
your
*NL*
company
-RRB-
,
has
promised
her
that
,
if
he
is
elected
to
the
Academy
-LRB-
he
*NL*
is
one
of
the
Doctor
's
colleagues
-RRB-
,
he
will
get
Machard
to
paint
her
*NL*
portrait
.
So
she
's
got
something
to
look
forward
to
!
I
have
another
*NL*
friend
who
insists
that
she
'd
rather
have
Leloir
.
I
'm
only
a
wretched
*NL*
Philistine
,
and
I
've
no
doubt
Leloir
has
perhaps
more
knowledge
of
*NL*
painting
even
than
Machard
.
But
I
do
think
that
the
most
important
*NL*
thing
about
a
portrait
,
especially
when
it
's
going
to
cost
ten
thousand
*NL*
francs
,
is
that
it
should
be
like
,
and
a
pleasant
likeness
,
if
you
know
*NL*
what
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
exhausted
this
topic
,
to
which
she
had
been
inspired
by
the
*NL*
loftiness
of
her
plume
,
the
monogram
on
her
card-case
,
the
little
number
*NL*
inked
inside
each
of
her
gloves
by
the
cleaner
,
and
the
difficulty
of
*NL*
speaking
to
Swann
about
the
Verdurins
,
Mme.
Cottard
,
seeing
that
they
*NL*
had
still
a
long
way
to
go
before
they
would
reach
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
Rue
Bonaparte
,
where
the
conductor
was
to
set
her
down
,
listened
to
the
*NL*
promptings
of
her
heart
,
which
counselled
other
words
than
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
ears
must
have
been
burning
,
''
she
ventured
,
``
while
we
were
on
the
*NL*
yacht
with
Mme.
Verdurin
.
We
were
talking
about
you
all
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Swann
was
genuinely
astonished
,
for
he
supposed
that
his
name
was
never
*NL*
uttered
in
the
Verdurins
'
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
Mme.
Cottard
went
on
,
``
Mme.
de
Crécy
was
there
;
need
I
say
*NL*
more
?
When
Odette
is
anywhere
it
's
never
long
before
she
begins
talking
*NL*
about
you
.
And
you
know
quite
well
,
it
is
n't
nasty
things
she
says
.
*NL*
What
!
you
do
n't
believe
me
!
''
she
went
on
,
noticing
that
Svrann
looked
*NL*
sceptical
.
And
,
carried
away
by
the
sincerity
of
her
conviction
,
without
*NL*
putting
any
evil
meaning
into
the
word
,
which
she
used
purely
in
the
*NL*
sense
in
which
one
employs
it
to
speak
of
the
affection
that
unites
a
*NL*
pair
of
friends
:
``
Why
,
she
_
adores
_
you
!
No
,
indeed
;
I
'm
sure
it
would
*NL*
never
do
to
say
anything
against
you
when
she
was
about
;
one
would
soon
*NL*
be
taught
one
's
place
!
Whatever
we
might
be
doing
,
if
we
were
looking
at
*NL*
a
picture
,
for
instance
,
she
would
say
,
`
If
only
we
had
him
here
,
he
's
*NL*
the
man
who
could
tell
us
whether
it
's
genuine
or
not
.
There
's
no
one
*NL*
like
him
for
that
.
'
And
all
day
long
she
would
be
saying
,
`
What
can
*NL*
he
be
doing
just
now
?
I
do
hope
,
he
's
doing
a
little
work
!
It
's
too
*NL*
dreadful
that
a
fellow
with
such
gifts
as
he
has
should
be
so
lazy
.
'
*NL*
-LRB-
Forgive
me
,
wo
n't
you
.
-RRB-
'
I
can
see
him
this
very
moment
;
he
's
thinking
*NL*
of
us
,
he
's
wondering
where
we
are
.
'
Indeed
,
she
used
an
expression
*NL*
which
I
thought
very
pretty
at
the
time
.
M.
Verdurin
asked
her
,
`
How
in
*NL*
the
world
can
you
see
what
he
's
doing
,
when
he
's
a
thousand
miles
away
?
'
*NL*
And
Odette
answered
,
`
Nothing
is
impossible
to
the
eye
of
a
friend
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
assure
you
,
I
'm
not
saying
it
just
to
flatter
you
;
you
have
a
*NL*
true
friend
in
her
,
such
as
one
does
n't
often
find
.
I
can
tell
you
,
*NL*
besides
,
in
case
you
do
n't
know
it
,
that
you
're
the
only
one
.
Mme.
*NL*
Verdurin
told
me
as
much
herself
on
our
last
day
with
them
-LRB-
one
talks
*NL*
more
freely
,
do
n't
you
know
,
before
a
parting
-RRB-
,
'
I
do
n't
say
that
Odette
*NL*
is
n't
fond
of
us
,
but
anything
that
we
may
say
to
her
counts
for
very
*NL*
little
beside
what
Swann
might
say
.
'
Oh
,
mercy
,
there
's
the
conductor
*NL*
stopping
for
me
;
here
have
I
been
chatting
away
to
you
,
and
would
have
*NL*
gone
right
past
the
Rue
Bonaparte
,
and
never
noticed
...
Will
you
be
so
*NL*
very
kind
as
to
tell
me
whether
my
plume
is
straight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Mme.
Cottard
withdrew
from
her
muff
,
to
offer
it
to
Swann
,
a
*NL*
white-gloved
hand
from
which
there
floated
,
with
a
transier-ticket
,
an
*NL*
atmosphere
of
fashionable
life
that
pervaded
the
omnibus
,
blended
with
*NL*
the
harsher
fragrance
of
newly
cleaned
kid
.
And
Swann
felt
himself
*NL*
overflowing
with
gratitude
to
her
,
as
well
as
to
Mme.
Verdurin
-LRB-
and
*NL*
almost
to
Odette
,
for
the
feeling
that
he
now
entertained
for
her
was
*NL*
no
longer
tinged
with
pain
,
was
scarcely
even
to
be
described
,
now
,
*NL*
as
love
-RRB-
,
while
from
the
platform
of
the
omnibus
he
followed
her
with
*NL*
loving
eyes
,
as
she
gallantly
threaded
her
way
along
the
Rue
Bonaparte
,
*NL*
her
plume
erect
,
her
skirt
held
up
in
one
hand
,
while
in
the
other
she
*NL*
clasped
her
umbrella
and
her
card-case
,
so
that
its
monogram
could
be
*NL*
seen
,
her
muff
dancing
in
the
air
before
her
as
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
compete
with
and
so
to
stimulate
the
moribund
feelings
that
Swann
had
*NL*
for
Odette
,
Mme.
Cottard
,
a
wiser
physician
,
in
this
case
,
than
ever
*NL*
her
husband
would
have
been
,
had
grafted
among
them
others
more
normal
,
*NL*
feelings
of
gratitude
,
of
friendship
,
which
in
Swann
's
mind
were
to
make
*NL*
Odette
seem
again
more
human
-LRB-
more
like
other
women
,
since
other
women
*NL*
could
inspire
the
same
feelings
in
him
-RRB-
,
were
to
hasten
her
final
*NL*
transformation
back
into
that
Odette
,
loved
with
an
undisturbed
*NL*
affection
,
who
had
taken
him
home
one
evening
after
a
revel
at
the
*NL*
painter
's
,
to
drink
orangeade
with
Forcheville
,
that
Odette
with
whom
*NL*
Swann
had
calculated
that
he
might
live
in
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
former
times
,
having
often
thought
with
terror
that
a
day
must
come
*NL*
when
he
would
cease
to
be
in
love
with
Odette
,
he
had
determined
to
*NL*
keep
a
sharp
look-out
,
and
as
soon
as
he
felt
that
love
was
beginning
to
*NL*
escape
him
,
to
cling
tightly
to
it
and
to
hold
it
back
.
But
now
,
to
the
*NL*
faintness
of
his
love
there
corresponded
a
simultaneous
faintness
in
*NL*
his
desire
to
remain
her
lover
.
For
a
man
can
not
change
,
that
is
to
say
*NL*
become
another
person
,
while
he
continues
to
obey
the
dictates
of
the
*NL*
self
which
he
has
ceased
to
be
.
Occasionally
the
name
,
if
it
caught
*NL*
his
eye
in
a
newspaper
,
of
one
of
the
men
whom
he
supposed
to
have
been
*NL*
Odette
's
lovers
,
reawakened
his
jealousy
.
But
it
was
very
slight
,
and
,
*NL*
inasmuch
as
it
proved
to
him
that
he
had
not
completely
emerged
from
*NL*
that
period
in
which
he
had
so
keenly
suffered
--
though
in
it
he
had
also
*NL*
known
a
way
of
feeling
so
intensely
happy
--
and
that
the
accidents
of
his
*NL*
course
might
still
enable
him
to
catch
an
occasional
glimpse
,
stealthily
*NL*
and
at
a
distance
,
of
its
beauties
,
this
jealousy
gave
him
,
if
anything
,
*NL*
an
agreeable
thrill
,
as
to
the
sad
Parisian
,
when
he
has
left
Venice
*NL*
behind
him
and
must
return
to
France
,
a
last
mosquito
proves
that
*NL*
Italy
and
summer
are
still
not
too
remote
.
But
,
as
a
rule
,
with
this
*NL*
particular
period
of
his
life
from
which
he
was
emerging
,
when
he
made
*NL*
an
effort
,
if
not
to
remain
in
it
,
at
least
to
obtain
,
while
still
he
*NL*
might
,
an
uninterrupted
view
of
it
,
he
discovered
that
already
it
was
*NL*
too
late
;
he
would
have
looked
back
to
distinguish
,
as
it
might
be
*NL*
a
landscape
that
was
about
to
disappear
,
that
love
from
which
he
had
*NL*
departed
,
but
it
is
so
difficult
to
enter
into
a
state
of
complete
*NL*
duality
and
to
present
to
oneself
the
lifelike
spectacle
of
a
feeling
*NL*
which
one
has
ceased
to
possess
,
that
very
soon
,
the
clouds
gathering
*NL*
in
his
brain
,
he
could
see
nothing
,
he
would
abandon
the
attempt
,
would
*NL*
take
the
glasses
from
his
nose
and
wipe
them
;
and
he
told
himself
that
*NL*
he
would
do
better
to
rest
for
a
little
,
that
there
would
be
time
enough
*NL*
later
on
,
and
settled
back
into
his
corner
with
as
little
curiosity
,
*NL*
with
as
much
torpor
as
the
drowsy
traveller
who
pulls
his
cap
down
over
*NL*
his
eyes
so
as
to
get
some
sleep
in
the
railway-carriage
that
is
drawing
*NL*
him
,
he
feels
,
faster
and
faster
,
out
of
the
country
in
which
he
has
*NL*
lived
for
so
long
,
and
which
he
vowed
that
he
would
not
allow
to
slip
*NL*
away
from
him
without
looking
out
to
bid
it
a
last
farewell
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
like
the
same
traveller
,
if
he
does
not
awake
until
he
has
crossed
the
*NL*
frontier
and
is
again
in
France
,
when
Swann
happened
to
alight
,
close
*NL*
at
hand
,
upon
something
which
proved
that
Forcheville
had
been
Odette
's
*NL*
lover
,
he
discovered
that
it
caused
him
no
pain
,
that
love
was
now
*NL*
utterly
remote
,
and
he
regretted
that
he
had
had
no
warning
of
the
*NL*
moment
in
which
he
had
emerged
from
it
for
ever
.
And
just
as
,
before
*NL*
kissing
Odette
for
the
first
time
,
he
had
sought
to
imprint
upon
his
*NL*
memory
the
face
that
for
so
long
had
been
familiar
,
before
it
was
*NL*
altered
by
the
additional
memory
of
their
kiss
,
so
he
could
have
*NL*
wished
--
in
thought
at
least
--
to
have
been
in
a
position
to
bid
farewell
,
*NL*
while
she
still
existed
,
to
that
Odette
who
had
inspired
love
in
him
and
*NL*
jealousy
,
to
that
Odette
who
had
caused
him
so
to
suffer
,
and
whom
now
*NL*
he
would
never
see
again
.
He
was
mistaken
.
He
was
destined
to
see
*NL*
her
once
again
,
a
few
weeks
later
.
It
was
while
he
was
asleep
,
in
the
*NL*
twilight
of
a
dream
.
He
was
walking
with
Mme.
Verdurin
,
Dr.
Cottard
,
*NL*
a
young
man
in
a
fez
whom
he
failed
to
identify
,
the
painter
,
Odette
,
*NL*
Napoleon
III
and
my
grandfather
,
along
a
path
which
followed
the
line
*NL*
of
the
coast
,
and
overhung
the
sea
,
now
at
a
great
height
,
now
by
a
few
*NL*
feet
only
,
so
that
they
were
continually
going
up
and
down
;
those
of
the
*NL*
party
who
had
reached
the
downward
slope
were
no
longer
visible
to
those
*NL*
who
were
still
climbing
;
what
little
daylight
yet
remained
was
failing
,
*NL*
and
it
seemed
as
though
a
black
night
was
immediately
to
fall
on
them
.
*NL*
Now
and
then
the
waves
dashed
against
the
cliff
,
and
Swann
could
feel
on
*NL*
his
cheek
a
shower
of
freezing
spray
.
Odette
told
him
to
wipe
this
off
,
*NL*
but
he
could
not
,
and
felt
confused
and
helpless
in
her
company
,
as
well
*NL*
as
because
he
was
in
his
nightshirt
.
He
hoped
that
,
in
the
darkness
,
*NL*
this
might
pass
unnoticed
;
Mme.
Verdurin
,
however
,
fixed
her
astonished
*NL*
gaze
upon
him
for
an
endless
moment
,
in
which
he
saw
her
face
change
*NL*
its
shape
,
her
nose
grow
longer
,
while
beneath
it
there
sprouted
a
heavy
*NL*
moustache
.
He
turned
away
to
examine
Odette
;
her
cheeks
were
pale
,
with
*NL*
little
fiery
spots
,
her
features
drawn
and
ringed
with
shadows
;
but
she
*NL*
looked
back
at
him
with
eyes
welling
with
affection
,
ready
to
detach
*NL*
themselves
like
tears
and
to
fall
upon
his
face
,
and
he
felt
that
he
*NL*
loved
her
so
much
that
he
would
have
liked
to
carry
her
off
with
him
*NL*
at
once
.
Suddenly
Odette
turned
her
wrist
,
glanced
at
a
tiny
watch
,
*NL*
and
said
:
``
I
must
go
.
''
She
took
leave
of
everyone
,
in
the
same
formal
*NL*
manner
,
without
taking
Swann
aside
,
without
telling
him
where
they
were
*NL*
to
meet
that
evening
,
or
next
day
.
He
dared
not
ask
,
he
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
follow
her
,
he
was
obliged
,
without
turning
back
in
her
direction
,
*NL*
to
answer
with
a
smile
some
question
by
Mme.
Verdurin
;
but
his
heart
was
*NL*
frantically
beating
,
he
felt
that
he
now
hated
Odette
,
he
would
gladly
*NL*
have
crushed
those
eyes
which
,
a
moment
ago
,
he
had
loved
so
dearly
,
*NL*
have
torn
the
blood
into
those
lifeless
cheeks
.
He
continued
to
climb
*NL*
with
Mme.
Verdurin
,
that
is
to
say
that
each
step
took
him
farther
from
*NL*
Odette
,
who
was
going
downhill
,
and
in
the
other
direction
.
A
second
*NL*
passed
and
it
was
many
hours
since
she
had
left
him
.
The
painter
*NL*
remarked
to
Swann
that
Napoleon
III
had
eclipsed
himself
immediately
*NL*
after
Odette
.
``
They
had
obviously
arranged
it
between
them
,
''
he
added
;
*NL*
``
they
must
have
agreed
to
meet
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
,
but
they
*NL*
would
n't
say
good-bye
together
;
it
might
have
looked
odd
.
She
is
his
*NL*
mistress
.
''
The
strange
young
man
burst
into
tears
.
Swann
endeavoured
to
*NL*
console
him
.
``
After
all
,
she
is
quite
right
,
''
he
said
to
the
young
man
,
*NL*
drying
his
eyes
for
him
and
taking
off
the
fez
to
make
him
feel
more
*NL*
at
ease
.
``
I
've
advised
her
to
do
that
,
myself
,
a
dozen
times
.
Why
be
*NL*
so
distressed
?
He
was
obviously
the
man
to
understand
her
.
''
So
Swann
*NL*
reasoned
with
himself
,
for
the
young
man
whom
he
had
failed
,
at
*NL*
first
,
to
identify
,
was
himself
also
;
like
certain
novelists
,
he
had
*NL*
distributed
his
own
personality
between
two
characters
,
him
who
was
the
*NL*
`
first
person
'
in
the
dream
,
and
another
whom
he
saw
before
him
,
capped
*NL*
with
a
fez
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Napoleon
III
,
it
was
to
Forcheville
that
some
vague
association
*NL*
of
ideas
,
then
a
certain
modification
of
the
Baron
's
usual
physiognomy
,
*NL*
and
lastly
the
broad
ribbon
of
the
Legion
of
Honour
across
his
breast
,
*NL*
had
made
Swann
give
that
name
;
but
actually
,
and
in
everything
that
the
*NL*
person
who
appeared
in
his
dream
represented
and
recalled
to
him
,
it
was
*NL*
indeed
Forcheville
.
For
,
from
an
incomplete
and
changing
set
of
images
,
*NL*
Swann
in
his
sleep
drew
false
deductions
,
enjoying
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
such
creative
power
that
he
was
able
to
reproduce
himself
by
a
simple
*NL*
act
of
division
,
like
certain
lower
organisms
;
with
the
warmth
that
he
*NL*
felt
in
his
own
palm
he
modelled
the
hollow
of
a
strange
hand
which
he
*NL*
thought
that
he
was
clasping
,
and
out
of
feelings
and
impressions
of
*NL*
which
he
was
not
yet
conscious
,
he
brought
about
sudden
vicissitudes
*NL*
which
,
by
a
chain
of
logical
sequences
,
would
produce
,
at
definite
*NL*
points
in
his
dream
,
the
person
required
to
receive
his
love
or
to
*NL*
startle
him
awake
.
In
an
instant
night
grew
black
about
him
;
an
alarum
*NL*
rang
,
the
inhabitants
ran
past
him
,
escaping
from
their
blazing
houses
;
*NL*
he
could
hear
the
thunder
of
the
surging
waves
,
and
also
of
his
own
*NL*
heart
,
which
,
with
equal
violence
,
was
anxiously
beating
in
his
breast
.
*NL*
Suddenly
the
speed
of
these
palpitations
redoubled
,
he
felt
a
pain
,
a
*NL*
nausea
that
were
inexplicable
;
a
peasant
,
dreadfully
burned
,
flung
at
*NL*
him
as
he
passed
:
``
Come
and
ask
Charlus
where
Odette
spent
the
night
*NL*
with
her
friend
.
He
used
to
go
about
with
her
,
and
she
tells
him
*NL*
everything
.
It
was
they
that
started
the
fire
.
''
It
was
his
valet
,
come
*NL*
to
awaken
him
,
and
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
it
is
eight
o'clock
,
and
the
barber
is
here
.
I
have
told
him
to
*NL*
call
again
in
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
words
,
as
they
dived
down
through
the
waves
of
sleep
in
which
*NL*
Swann
was
submerged
,
did
not
reach
his
consciousness
without
undergoing
*NL*
that
refraction
which
turns
a
ray
of
light
,
at
the
bottom
of
a
bowl
of
*NL*
water
,
into
another
sun
;
just
as
,
a
moment
earlier
,
the
sound
of
*NL*
the
door-bell
,
swelling
in
the
depths
of
his
abyss
of
sleep
into
the
*NL*
clangour
of
an
alarum
,
had
engendered
the
episode
of
the
fire
.
Meanwhile
*NL*
the
scenery
of
his
dream-stage
scattered
in
dust
,
he
opened
his
eyes
,
*NL*
heard
for
the
last
time
the
boom
of
a
wave
in
the
sea
,
grown
very
*NL*
distant
.
He
touched
his
cheek
.
It
was
dry
.
And
yet
he
could
feel
the
*NL*
sting
of
the
cold
spray
,
and
the
taste
of
salt
on
his
lips
.
He
rose
,
*NL*
and
dressed
himself
.
He
had
made
the
barber
come
early
because
he
had
*NL*
written
,
the
day
before
,
to
my
grandfather
,
to
say
that
he
was
going
,
*NL*
that
afternoon
,
to
Combray
,
having
learned
that
Mme.
de
Cambremer
--
Mlle.
*NL*
Legrandin
that
had
been
--
was
spending
a
few
days
there
.
The
association
*NL*
in
his
memory
of
her
young
and
charming
face
with
a
place
in
the
country
*NL*
which
he
had
not
visited
for
so
long
,
offered
him
a
combined
attraction
*NL*
which
had
made
him
decide
at
last
to
leave
Paris
for
a
while
.
As
the
*NL*
different
changes
and
chances
that
bring
us
into
the
company
of
certain
*NL*
other
people
in
this
life
do
not
coincide
with
the
periods
in
which
we
*NL*
are
in
love
with
those
people
,
but
,
overlapping
them
,
may
occur
before
*NL*
love
has
begun
,
and
may
be
repeated
after
love
is
ended
,
the
earliest
*NL*
appearances
,
in
our
life
,
of
a
creature
who
is
destined
to
afford
us
*NL*
pleasure
later
on
,
assume
retrospectively
in
our
eyes
a
certain
value
as
*NL*
an
indication
,
a
warning
,
a
presage
.
It
was
in
this
fashion
that
Swann
*NL*
had
often
carried
back
his
mind
to
the
image
of
Odette
,
encountered
in
*NL*
the
theatre
,
on
that
first
evening
when
he
had
no
thought
of
ever
*NL*
seeing
her
again
--
and
that
he
now
recalled
the
party
at
Mme.
de
*NL*
Saint-Euverte
's
,
at
which
he
had
introduced
General
de
Frober-ville
to
*NL*
Mme.
de
Cambremer
.
So
manifold
are
our
interests
in
life
that
it
is
*NL*
not
uncommon
that
,
on
a
single
occasion
,
the
foundations
of
a
happiness
*NL*
which
does
not
yet
exist
are
laid
down
simultaneously
with
aggravations
*NL*
of
a
grief
from
which
we
are
still
suffering
.
And
,
no
doubt
,
that
might
*NL*
have
occurred
to
Swann
elsewhere
than
at
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
.
Who
,
*NL*
indeed
,
can
say
whether
,
in
the
event
of
his
having
gone
,
that
evening
,
*NL*
somewhere
else
,
other
happinesses
,
other
griefs
would
not
have
come
to
*NL*
him
,
which
,
later
,
would
have
appeared
to
have
been
inevitable
?
But
what
*NL*
did
seem
to
him
to
have
been
inevitable
was
what
had
indeed
taken
place
,
*NL*
and
he
was
not
far
short
of
seeing
something
providential
in
the
fact
*NL*
that
he
had
at
last
decided
to
go
to
Mme.
de
Saint-Euverte
's
that
*NL*
evening
,
because
his
mind
,
anxious
to
admire
the
richness
of
invention
*NL*
that
life
shews
,
and
incapable
of
facing
a
difficult
problem
for
any
*NL*
length
of
time
,
such
as
to
discover
what
,
actually
,
had
been
most
to
be
*NL*
wished
for
,
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
sufferings
through
which
he
*NL*
had
passed
that
evening
,
and
the
pleasures
,
at
that
time
unsuspected
,
*NL*
which
were
already
being
brought
to
birth
,
--
the
exact
balance
between
*NL*
which
was
too
difficult
to
establish
--
were
linked
by
a
sort
of
*NL*
concatenation
of
necessity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
,
an
hour
after
his
awakening
,
he
was
giving
instructions
*NL*
to
the
barber
,
so
that
his
stiffly
brushed
hair
should
not
become
*NL*
disarranged
on
the
journey
,
he
thought
once
again
of
his
dream
;
he
*NL*
saw
once
again
,
as
he
had
felt
them
close
beside
him
,
Odette
's
pallid
*NL*
complexion
,
her
too
thin
cheeks
,
her
drawn
features
,
her
tired
eyes
,
all
*NL*
the
things
which
--
in
the
course
of
those
successive
bursts
of
affection
*NL*
which
had
made
of
his
enduring
love
for
Odette
a
long
oblivion
of
the
*NL*
first
impression
that
he
had
formed
of
her
--
he
had
ceased
to
observe
*NL*
after
the
first
few
days
of
their
intimacy
,
days
to
which
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
while
he
slept
,
his
memory
had
returned
to
seek
the
exact
sensation
of
*NL*
those
things
.
And
with
that
old
,
intermittent
fatuity
,
which
reappeared
*NL*
in
him
now
that
he
was
no
longer
unhappy
,
and
lowered
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
the
average
level
of
his
morality
,
he
cried
out
in
his
heart
:
``
To
think
*NL*
that
I
have
wasted
years
of
my
life
,
that
I
have
longed
for
death
,
that
*NL*
the
greatest
love
that
I
have
ever
known
has
been
for
a
woman
who
did
*NL*
not
please
me
,
who
was
not
in
my
style

PLACE-NAMES
:
THE
NAME
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
rooms
which
used
most
commonly
to
take
shape
in
my
mind
during
*NL*
my
long
nights
of
sleeplessness
,
there
was
none
that
differed
more
*NL*
utterly
from
the
rooms
at
Combray
,
thickly
powdered
with
the
motes
of
an
*NL*
atmosphere
granular
,
pollenous
,
edible
and
instinct
with
piety
,
than
*NL*
my
room
in
the
Grand
Hôtel
de
la
Plage
,
at
Balbec
,
the
walls
of
which
,
*NL*
washed
with
ripolin
,
contained
,
like
the
polished
sides
of
a
basin
in
*NL*
which
the
water
glows
with
a
blue
,
lurking
fire
,
a
finer
air
,
pure
,
*NL*
azure-tinted
,
saline
.
The
Bavarian
upholsterer
who
had
been
entrusted
*NL*
with
the
furnishing
of
this
hotel
had
varied
his
scheme
of
decoration
*NL*
in
different
rooms
,
and
in
that
which
I
found
myself
occupying
had
set
*NL*
against
the
walls
,
on
three
sides
of
it
,
a
series
of
low
book-cases
*NL*
with
glass
fronts
,
in
which
,
according
to
where
they
stood
,
by
a
law
*NL*
of
nature
which
he
had
,
perhaps
,
forgotten
to
take
into
account
,
was
*NL*
reflected
this
or
that
section
of
the
ever-changing
view
of
the
sea
,
so
*NL*
that
the
walls
were
lined
with
a
frieze
of
seascapes
,
interrupted
only
*NL*
by
the
polished
mahogany
of
the
actual
shelves
.
And
so
effective
was
*NL*
this
that
the
whole
room
had
the
appearance
of
one
of
those
model
*NL*
bedrooms
which
you
see
nowadays
in
Housing
Exhibitions
,
decorated
with
*NL*
works
of
art
which
are
calculated
by
their
designer
to
refresh
the
eyes
*NL*
of
whoever
may
ultimately
have
to
sleep
in
the
rooms
,
the
subjects
being
*NL*
kept
in
some
degree
of
harmony
with
the
locality
and
surroundings
of
the
*NL*
houses
for
which
the
rooms
are
planned
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
nothing
could
have
differed
more
utterly
,
either
,
from
the
real
*NL*
Balbec
than
that
other
Balbec
of
which
I
had
often
dreamed
,
on
stormy
*NL*
days
,
when
the
wind
was
so
strong
that
Françoise
,
as
she
took
me
to
*NL*
the
Champs-Elysées
,
would
warn
me
not
to
walk
too
near
the
side
of
the
*NL*
street
,
or
I
might
have
my
head
knocked
off
by
a
falling
slate
,
and
*NL*
would
recount
to
me
,
with
many
lamentations
,
the
terrible
disasters
and
*NL*
shipwrecks
that
were
reported
in
the
newspaper
.
I
longed
for
nothing
*NL*
more
than
to
behold
a
storm
at
sea
,
less
as
a
mighty
spectacle
than
as
*NL*
a
momentary
revelation
of
the
true
life
of
nature
;
or
rather
there
*NL*
were
for
me
no
mighty
spectacles
save
those
which
I
knew
to
be
*NL*
not
artificially
composed
for
my
entertainment
,
but
necessary
and
*NL*
unalterable
,
--
the
beauty
of
landscapes
or
of
great
works
of
art
.
I
was
*NL*
not
curious
,
I
did
not
thirst
to
know
anything
save
what
I
believed
*NL*
to
be
more
genuine
than
myself
,
what
had
for
me
the
supreme
merit
of
*NL*
shewing
me
a
fragment
of
the
mind
of
a
great
genius
,
or
of
the
force
*NL*
or
the
grace
of
nature
as
she
appeared
when
left
entirely
to
herself
,
*NL*
without
human
interference
.
Just
as
the
lovely
sound
of
her
voice
,
*NL*
reproduced
,
all
by
itself
,
upon
the
phonograph
,
could
never
console
a
*NL*
man
for
the
loss
of
his
mother
,
so
a
mechanical
imitation
of
a
storm
*NL*
would
have
left
me
as
cold
as
did
the
illuminated
fountains
at
the
*NL*
Exhibition
.
I
required
also
,
if
the
storm
was
to
be
absolutely
genuine
,
*NL*
that
the
shore
from
which
I
watched
it
should
be
a
natural
shore
,
not
an
*NL*
embankment
recently
constructed
by
a
municipality
.
Besides
,
nature
,
by
*NL*
all
the
feelings
that
she
aroused
in
me
,
seemed
to
me
the
most
opposite
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
to
the
mechanical
inventions
of
mankind
The
less
she
*NL*
bore
their
imprint
,
the
more
room
she
offered
for
the
expansion
of
my
*NL*
heart
.
And
,
as
it
happened
,
I
had
preserved
the
name
of
Balbec
,
which
*NL*
Legrandin
had
cited
to
us
,
as
that
of
a
sea-side
place
in
the
very
midst
*NL*
of
``
that
funereal
coast
,
famed
for
the
number
of
its
wrecks
,
swathed
,
*NL*
for
six
months
in
the
year
,
in
a
shroud
of
fog
and
flying
foam
from
the
*NL*
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
feel
,
there
,
below
your
feet
still
,
''
he
had
told
me
,
``
far
more
even
*NL*
than
at
Finistère
-LRB-
and
even
though
hotels
are
now
being
superimposed
*NL*
upon
it
,
without
power
,
however
,
to
modify
that
oldest
bone
in
the
*NL*
earth
's
skeleton
-RRB-
you
feel
there
that
you
are
actually
at
the
land
's
*NL*
end
of
France
,
of
Europe
,
of
the
Old
World
.
And
it
is
the
ultimate
*NL*
encampment
of
the
fishermen
,
precisely
like
the
fishermen
who
have
*NL*
lived
since
the
world
's
beginning
,
facing
the
everlasting
kingdom
of
*NL*
the
sea-fogs
and
shadows
of
the
night
.
''
One
day
when
,
at
Combray
,
I
had
*NL*
spoken
of
this
coast
,
this
Balbec
,
before
M.
Swann
,
hoping
to
learn
from
*NL*
him
whether
it
was
the
best
point
to
select
for
seeing
the
most
violent
*NL*
storms
,
he
had
replied
:
``
I
should
think
I
did
know
Balbec
!
The
church
*NL*
at
Balbec
,
built
in
the
twelfth
and
thirteenth
centuries
,
and
still
*NL*
half
romanesque
,
is
perhaps
the
most
curious
example
to
be
found
of
our
*NL*
Norman
gothic
,
and
so
exceptional
that
one
is
tempted
to
describe
it
*NL*
as
Persian
in
its
inspiration
.
''
And
that
region
,
which
,
until
then
,
had
*NL*
seemed
to
me
to
be
nothing
else
than
a
part
of
immemorial
nature
,
that
*NL*
had
remained
contemporaneous
with
the
great
phenomena
of
geology
--
and
as
*NL*
remote
from
human
history
as
the
Ocean
itself
,
or
the
Great
Bear
,
with
*NL*
its
wild
race
of
fishermen
for
whom
,
no
more
than
for
their
whales
,
*NL*
had
there
been
any
Middle
Ages
--
it
had
been
a
great
joy
to
me
to
see
*NL*
it
suddenly
take
its
place
in
the
order
of
the
centuries
,
with
a
stored
*NL*
consciousness
of
the
romanesque
epoch
,
and
to
know
that
the
gothic
*NL*
trefoil
had
come
to
diversify
those
wild
rocks
also
,
at
the
appointed
*NL*
hour
,
like
those
frail
but
hardy
plants
which
,
in
the
Polar
regions
,
*NL*
when
the
spring
returns
,
scatter
their
stars
about
the
eternal
snows
.
*NL*
And
if
gothic
art
brought
to
those
places
and
people
a
classification
*NL*
which
,
otherwise
,
they
lacked
,
they
too
conferred
one
upon
it
in
return
.
*NL*
I
tried
to
form
a
picture
in
my
mind
of
how
those
fishermen
had
lived
,
*NL*
the
timid
and
unsuspected
essay
towards
social
intercourse
which
they
*NL*
had
attempted
there
,
clustered
upon
a
promontory
of
the
shores
of
Hell
,
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
cliffs
of
death
;
and
gothic
art
seemed
to
me
a
more
*NL*
living
thing
now
that
,
detaching
it
from
the
towns
in
which
,
until
then
,
*NL*
I
had
always
imagined
it
,
I
could
see
how
,
in
a
particular
instance
,
*NL*
upon
a
reef
of
savage
rocks
,
it
had
taken
root
and
grown
until
it
*NL*
flowered
in
a
tapering
spire
.
I
was
taken
to
see
reproductions
of
the
*NL*
most
famous
of
the
statues
at
Balbec
,
--
shaggy
,
blunt-faced
Apostles
,
*NL*
the
Virgin
from
the
porch
,
--
and
I
could
scarcely
breathe
for
joy
at
the
*NL*
thought
that
I
might
myself
,
one
day
,
see
them
take
a
solid
form
against
*NL*
their
eternal
background
of
salt
fog
.
Thereafter
,
on
dear
,
tempestuous
*NL*
February
nights
,
the
wind
--
breathing
into
my
heart
,
which
it
shook
no
*NL*
less
violently
than
the
chimney
of
my
bedroom
,
the
project
of
a
visit
to
*NL*
Balbec
--
blended
in
me
the
desire
for
gothic
architecture
with
that
for
a
*NL*
storm
upon
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
liked
to
take
,
the
very
next
day
,
the
good
,
the
generous
*NL*
train
at
one
twenty-two
,
of
which
never
without
a
palpitating
heart
*NL*
could
I
read
,
in
the
railway
company
's
bills
or
in
advertisements
of
*NL*
circular
tours
,
the
hour
of
departure
:
it
seemed
to
me
to
cut
,
at
*NL*
a
precise
point
in
every
afternoon
,
a
most
fascinating
groove
,
a
*NL*
mysterious
mark
,
from
which
the
diverted
hours
still
led
one
on
,
of
*NL*
course
,
towards
evening
,
towards
to-morrow
morning
,
but
to
an
evening
*NL*
and
morning
which
one
would
behold
,
not
in
Paris
but
in
one
of
those
*NL*
towns
through
which
the
train
passed
and
among
which
it
allowed
one
*NL*
to
choose
;
for
it
stopped
at
Bayeux
,
at
Coutances
,
at
Vitré
,
at
*NL*
Questambert
,
at
Pontorson
,
at
Balbec
,
at
Lannion
,
at
Lamballe
,
at
*NL*
Benodet
,
at
Pont-Aven
,
at
Quimperle
,
and
progressed
magnificently
*NL*
surcharged
with
names
which
it
offered
me
,
so
that
,
among
them
all
,
I
*NL*
did
not
know
which
to
choose
,
so
impossible
was
it
to
sacrifice
any
.
*NL*
But
even
without
waiting
for
the
train
next
day
,
I
could
,
by
rising
and
*NL*
dressing
myself
with
all
speed
,
leave
Paris
that
very
evening
,
should
*NL*
my
parents
permit
,
and
arrive
at
Balbec
as
dawn
spread
westward
over
the
*NL*
raging
sea
,
from
whose
driven
foam
I
would
seek
shelter
in
that
church
*NL*
in
the
Persian
manner
.
But
at
the
approach
of
the
Easter
holidays
,
when
*NL*
my
parents
had
promised
to
let
me
spend
them
,
for
once
,
in
the
North
*NL*
of
Italy
,
lo
!
in
place
of
those
dreams
of
tempests
,
by
which
I
had
been
*NL*
entirely
possessed
,
not
wishing
to
see
anything
but
waves
dashing
in
*NL*
from
all
sides
,
mounting
always
higher
,
upon
the
wildest
of
coasts
,
*NL*
beside
churches
as
rugged
and
precipitous
as
cliffs
,
in
whose
towers
*NL*
the
sea-birds
would
be
wailing
;
suddenly
,
effacing
them
,
taking
away
*NL*
all
their
charm
,
excluding
them
because
they
were
its
opposite
and
could
*NL*
only
have
weakened
its
effect
,
was
substituted
in
me
the
converse
dream
*NL*
of
the
most
variegated
of
springs
,
not
the
spring
of
Combray
,
still
*NL*
pricking
with
all
the
needle-points
of
the
winter
's
frost
,
but
that
*NL*
which
already
covered
with
lilies
and
anemones
the
meadows
of
Fiesole
,
*NL*
and
gave
Florence
a
dazzling
golden
background
,
like
those
in
Fra
*NL*
Angelico
's
pictures
.
From
that
moment
,
only
sunlight
,
perfumes
,
colours
,
*NL*
seemed
to
me
to
have
any
value
;
for
this
alternation
of
images
had
*NL*
effected
a
change
of
front
in
my
desire
,
and
--
as
abrupt
as
those
that
*NL*
occur
sometimes
in
music
,
--
a
complete
change
of
tone
in
my
sensibility
.
*NL*
Thus
it
came
about
that
a
mere
atmospheric
variation
would
be
sufficient
*NL*
to
provoke
in
me
that
modulation
,
without
there
being
any
need
for
me
to
*NL*
await
the
return
of
a
season
.
For
often
we
find
a
day
,
in
one
,
that
has
*NL*
strayed
from
another
season
,
and
makes
us
live
in
that
other
,
summons
at
*NL*
once
into
our
presence
and
makes
us
long
for
its
peculiar
pleasures
,
and
*NL*
interrupts
the
dreams
that
we
were
in
process
of
weaving
,
by
inserting
,
*NL*
out
of
its
turn
,
too
early
or
too
late
,
this
leaf
,
torn
from
another
*NL*
chapter
,
in
the
interpolated
calendar
of
Happiness
.
But
soon
it
happened
*NL*
that
,
like
those
natural
phenomena
from
which
our
comfort
or
our
health
*NL*
can
derive
but
an
accidental
and
all
too
modest
benefit
,
until
the
day
*NL*
when
science
takes
control
of
them
,
and
,
producing
them
at
will
,
places
*NL*
in
our
hands
the
power
to
order
their
appearance
,
withdrawn
from
*NL*
the
tutelage
and
independent
of
the
consent
of
chance
;
similarly
the
*NL*
production
of
these
dreams
of
the
Atlantic
and
of
Italy
ceased
to
depend
*NL*
entirely
upon
the
changes
of
the
seasons
and
of
the
weather
.
I
need
*NL*
only
,
to
make
them
reappear
,
pronounce
the
names
:
Balbec
,
Venice
,
*NL*
Florence
,
within
whose
syllables
had
gradually
accumulated
all
the
*NL*
longing
inspired
in
me
by
the
places
for
which
they
stood
.
Even
in
*NL*
spring
,
to
come
in
a
book
upon
the
name
of
Balbec
sufficed
to
awaken
*NL*
in
me
the
desire
for
storms
at
sea
and
for
the
Norman
gothic
;
even
on
a
*NL*
stormy
day
the
name
of
Florence
or
of
Venice
would
awaken
the
desire
for
*NL*
sunshine
,
for
lilies
,
for
the
Palace
of
the
Doges
and
for
Santa
Maria
*NL*
del
Fiore
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
their
names
thus
permanently
absorbed
the
image
that
I
had
formed
*NL*
of
these
towns
,
it
was
only
by
transforming
that
image
,
by
subordinating
*NL*
its
reappearance
in
me
to
their
own
special
laws
;
and
in
consequence
of
*NL*
this
they
made
it
more
beautiful
,
but
at
the
same
time
more
different
*NL*
from
anything
that
the
towns
of
Normandy
or
Tuscany
could
in
reality
be
,
*NL*
and
,
by
increasing
the
arbitrary
delights
of
my
imagination
,
aggravated
*NL*
the
disenchantment
that
was
in
store
for
me
when
I
set
out
upon
my
*NL*
travels
.
They
magnified
the
idea
that
I
formed
of
certain
points
on
the
*NL*
earth
's
surface
,
making
them
more
special
,
and
in
consequence
more
*NL*
real
.
I
did
not
then
represent
to
myself
towns
,
landscapes
,
historic
*NL*
buildings
,
as
pictures
more
or
less
attractive
,
cut
out
here
and
there
*NL*
of
a
substance
that
was
common
to
them
all
,
but
looked
on
each
of
them
*NL*
as
on
an
unknown
thing
,
different
from
all
the
rest
,
a
thing
for
which
*NL*
my
soul
was
athirst
,
by
the
knowledge
of
which
it
would
benefit
.
How
*NL*
much
more
individual
still
was
the
character
that
they
assumed
from
*NL*
being
designated
by
names
,
names
that
were
only
for
themselves
,
proper
*NL*
names
such
as
people
have
.
Words
present
to
us
little
pictures
of
*NL*
things
,
lucid
and
normal
,
like
the
pictures
that
are
hung
on
the
walls
*NL*
of
schoolrooms
to
give
children
an
illustration
of
what
is
meant
by
*NL*
a
carpenter
's
bench
,
a
bird
,
an
ant-hill
;
things
chosen
as
typical
of
*NL*
everything
else
of
the
same
sort
.
But
names
present
to
us
--
of
persons
*NL*
and
of
towns
which
they
accustom
us
to
regard
as
individual
,
as
unique
,
*NL*
like
persons
--
a
confused
picture
,
which
draws
from
the
names
,
from
*NL*
the
brightness
or
darkness
of
their
sound
,
the
colour
in
which
it
is
*NL*
uniformly
painted
,
like
one
of
those
posters
,
entirely
blue
or
entirely
*NL*
red
,
in
which
,
on
account
of
the
limitations
imposed
by
the
process
used
*NL*
in
their
reproduction
,
or
by
a
whim
on
the
designer
's
part
,
are
blue
or
*NL*
red
not
only
the
sky
and
the
sea
,
but
the
ships
and
the
church
and
the
*NL*
people
in
the
streets
.
The
name
of
Parma
,
one
of
the
towns
that
I
most
*NL*
longed
to
visit
,
after
reading
the
_
Chartreuse
_
,
seeming
to
me
compact
*NL*
and
glossy
,
violet-tinted
,
soft
,
if
anyone
were
to
speak
of
such
or
*NL*
such
a
house
in
Parma
,
in
which
I
should
be
lodged
,
he
would
give
me
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
thinking
that
I
was
to
inhabit
a
dwelling
that
was
compact
*NL*
and
glossy
,
violet-tinted
,
soft
,
and
that
bore
no
relation
to
the
houses
*NL*
in
any
other
town
in
Italy
,
since
I
could
imagine
it
only
by
the
aid
*NL*
of
that
heavy
syllable
of
the
name
of
Parma
,
in
which
no
breath
of
air
*NL*
stirred
,
and
of
all
that
I
had
made
it
assume
of
Stendhalian
sweetness
*NL*
and
the
reflected
hue
of
violets
.
And
when
I
thought
of
Florence
,
it
was
*NL*
of
a
town
miraculously
embalmed
,
and
flower-like
,
since
it
was
called
*NL*
the
City
of
the
Lilies
,
and
its
Cathedral
,
Our
Lady
of
the
Flower
.
As
*NL*
for
Balbec
,
it
was
one
of
those
names
in
which
,
as
on
an
old
piece
of
*NL*
Norman
pottery
that
still
keeps
the
colour
of
the
earth
from
which
*NL*
it
was
fashioned
,
one
sees
depicted
still
the
representation
of
some
*NL*
long-abolished
custom
,
of
some
feudal
right
,
of
the
former
condition
of
*NL*
some
place
,
of
an
obsolete
way
of
pronouncing
the
language
,
which
had
*NL*
shaped
and
wedded
its
incongruous
syllables
and
which
I
never
doubted
*NL*
that
I
should
find
spoken
there
at
once
,
even
by
the
inn-keeper
who
*NL*
would
pour
me
out
coffee
and
milk
on
my
arrival
,
taking
me
down
to
watch
*NL*
the
turbulent
sea
,
unchained
,
before
the
church
;
to
whom
I
lent
the
*NL*
aspect
,
disputatious
,
solemn
and
mediaeval
,
of
some
character
in
one
of
*NL*
the
old
romances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
my
health
definitely
improved
,
had
my
parents
allowed
me
,
if
not
*NL*
actually
to
go
down
to
stay
at
Balbec
,
at
least
to
take
,
just
once
,
so
*NL*
as
to
become
acquainted
with
the
architecture
and
landscapes
of
Normandy
*NL*
or
of
Brittany
,
that
one
twenty-two
train
into
which
I
had
so
often
*NL*
clambered
in
imagination
,
I
should
have
preferred
to
stop
,
and
to
alight
*NL*
from
it
,
at
the
most
beautiful
of
its
towns
;
but
in
vain
might
I
*NL*
compare
and
contrast
them
;
how
was
one
to
choose
,
any
more
than
between
*NL*
individual
people
,
who
are
not
interchangeable
,
between
Bayeux
,
so
lofty
*NL*
in
its
noble
coronet
of
rusty
lace
,
whose
highest
point
caught
the
light
*NL*
of
the
old
gold
of
its
second
syllable
;
Vitré
,
whose
acute
accent
barred
*NL*
its
ancient
glass
with
wooden
lozenges
;
gentle
Lamballe
,
whose
whiteness
*NL*
ranged
from
egg-shell
yellow
to
a
pearly
grey
;
Coutances
,
a
Norman
*NL*
Cathedral
,
which
its
final
consonants
,
rich
and
yellowing
,
crowned
with
*NL*
a
tower
of
butter
;
Lannion
with
the
rumble
and
buzz
,
in
the
silence
of
*NL*
its
village
street
,
of
the
fly
on
the
wheel
of
the
coach
;
Questambert
,
*NL*
Pontorson
,
ridiculously
silly
and
simple
,
white
feathers
and
yellow
*NL*
beaks
strewn
along
the
road
to
those
well-watered
and
poetic
spots
;
*NL*
Benodet
,
a
name
scarcely
moored
that
seemed
to
be
striving
to
draw
the
*NL*
river
down
into
the
tangle
of
its
seaweeds
;
Pont-Aven
,
the
snowy
,
rosy
*NL*
flight
of
the
wing
of
a
lightly
poised
coif
,
tremulously
reflected
in
*NL*
the
greenish
waters
of
a
canal
;
Quimperlé
,
more
firmly
attached
,
this
,
*NL*
and
since
the
Middle
Ages
,
among
the
rivulets
with
which
it
babbled
,
*NL*
threading
their
pearls
upon
a
grey
background
,
like
the
pattern
made
,
*NL*
through
the
cobwebs
upon
a
window
,
by
rays
of
sunlight
changed
into
*NL*
blunt
points
of
tarnished
silver
?
*NL*
*NL*
These
images
were
false
for
another
reason
also
;
namely
,
that
they
*NL*
were
necessarily
much
simplified
;
doubtless
the
object
to
which
my
*NL*
imagination
aspired
,
which
my
senses
took
in
but
incompletely
and
*NL*
without
any
immediate
pleasure
,
I
had
committed
to
the
safe
custody
*NL*
of
names
;
doubtless
because
I
had
accumulated
there
a
store
of
dreams
,
*NL*
those
names
now
magnetised
my
desires
;
but
names
themselves
are
not
very
*NL*
comprehensive
;
the
most
that
I
could
do
was
to
include
in
each
of
them
*NL*
two
or
three
of
the
principal
curiosities
of
the
town
,
which
would
*NL*
lie
there
side
by
side
,
without
interval
or
partition
;
in
the
name
of
*NL*
Balbec
,
as
in
the
magnifying
glasses
set
in
those
penholders
which
*NL*
one
buys
at
sea-side
places
,
I
could
distinguish
waves
surging
round
*NL*
a
church
built
in
the
Persian
manner
.
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
the
enforced
*NL*
simplicity
of
these
images
was
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
hold
that
they
*NL*
had
over
me
.
When
my
father
had
decided
,
one
year
,
that
we
should
go
*NL*
for
the
Easter
holidays
to
Florence
and
Venice
,
not
finding
room
*NL*
to
introduce
into
the
name
of
Florence
the
elements
that
ordinarily
*NL*
constitute
a
town
,
I
was
obliged
to
let
a
supernatural
city
emerge
from
*NL*
the
impregnation
by
certain
vernal
scenes
of
what
I
supposed
to
be
,
*NL*
in
its
essentials
,
the
genius
of
Giotto
.
All
the
more
--
and
because
one
*NL*
can
not
make
a
name
extend
much
further
in
time
than
in
space
--
like
some
*NL*
of
Giotto
's
paintings
themselves
which
shew
us
at
two
separate
moments
*NL*
the
same
person
engaged
in
different
actions
,
here
lying
on
his
bed
,
*NL*
there
just
about
to
mount
his
horse
,
the
name
of
Florence
was
divided
*NL*
into
two
compartments
.
In
one
,
beneath
an
architectural
dais
,
I
gazed
*NL*
upon
a
fresco
over
which
was
partly
drawn
a
curtain
of
morning
sunlight
,
*NL*
dusty
,
aslant
,
and
gradually
spreading
;
in
the
other
-LRB-
for
,
since
*NL*
I
thought
of
names
not
as
an
inaccessible
ideal
but
as
a
real
and
*NL*
enveloping
substance
into
which
I
was
about
to
plunge
,
the
life
not
yet
*NL*
lived
,
the
life
intact
and
pure
which
I
enclosed
in
them
,
gave
to
the
*NL*
most
material
pleasures
,
to
the
simplest
scenes
,
the
same
attraction
*NL*
that
they
have
in
the
works
of
the
Primitives
-RRB-
,
I
moved
swiftly
--
so
as
*NL*
to
arrive
,
as
soon
as
might
be
,
at
the
table
that
was
spread
for
me
,
*NL*
with
fruit
and
a
flask
of
Chianti
--
across
a
Ponte
Vecchio
heaped
with
*NL*
jonquils
,
narcissi
and
anemones
.
That
-LRB-
for
all
that
I
was
still
in
*NL*
Paris
-RRB-
was
what
I
saw
,
and
not
what
was
actually
round
about
me
.
Even
*NL*
from
the
simplest
,
the
most
realistic
point
of
view
,
the
countries
for
*NL*
which
we
long
occupy
,
at
any
given
moment
,
a
far
larger
place
in
our
*NL*
true
life
than
the
country
in
which
we
may
happen
to
be
.
Doubtless
,
if
,
*NL*
at
that
time
,
I
had
paid
more
attention
to
what
was
in
my
mind
when
I
*NL*
pronounced
the
words
``
going
to
Florence
,
to
Parma
,
to
Pisa
,
to
Venice
,
''
*NL*
I
should
have
realised
that
what
I
saw
was
in
no
sense
a
town
,
but
*NL*
something
as
different
from
anything
that
I
knew
,
something
as
delicious
*NL*
as
might
be
for
a
human
race
whose
whole
existence
had
passed
in
a
*NL*
series
of
late
winter
afternoons
,
that
inconceivable
marvel
,
a
morning
*NL*
in
spring
.
These
images
,
unreal
,
fixed
,
always
alike
,
filling
all
my
*NL*
nights
and
days
,
differentiated
this
period
in
my
life
from
those
which
*NL*
had
gone
before
it
-LRB-
and
might
easily
have
been
confused
with
it
by
*NL*
an
observer
who
saw
things
only
from
without
,
that
is
to
say
,
who
saw
*NL*
nothing
-RRB-
,
as
in
an
opera
a
fresh
melody
introduces
a
novel
atmosphere
*NL*
which
one
could
never
have
suspected
if
one
had
done
no
more
than
*NL*
read
the
libretto
,
still
less
if
one
had
remained
outside
the
theatre
,
*NL*
counting
only
the
minutes
as
they
passed
.
And
besides
,
even
from
the
*NL*
point
of
view
of
mere
quantity
,
in
our
life
the
days
are
not
all
equal
.
*NL*
To
reach
the
end
of
a
day
,
natures
that
are
slightly
nervous
,
as
*NL*
mine
was
,
make
use
,
like
motor-cars
,
of
different
`
speeds
.
'
There
are
*NL*
mountainous
,
uncomfortable
days
,
up
which
one
takes
an
infinite
time
to
*NL*
pass
,
and
days
downward
sloping
,
through
which
one
can
go
at
full
tilt
,
*NL*
singing
as
one
goes
.
During
this
month
--
in
which
I
went
laboriously
*NL*
over
,
as
over
a
tune
,
though
never
to
my
satisfaction
,
these
visions
of
*NL*
Florence
,
Venice
,
Pisa
,
from
which
the
desire
that
they
excited
in
me
*NL*
drew
and
kept
something
as
profoundly
personal
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
love
,
love
for
another
person
--
I
never
ceased
to
believe
that
they
*NL*
corresponded
to
a
reality
independent
of
myself
,
and
they
made
me
*NL*
conscious
of
as
glorious
a
hope
as
could
have
been
cherished
by
a
*NL*
Christian
in
the
primitive
age
of
faith
,
on
the
eve
of
his
entry
into
*NL*
Paradise
.
Moreover
,
without
my
paying
any
heed
to
the
contradiction
that
*NL*
there
was
in
my
wishing
to
look
at
and
to
touch
with
my
organs
of
sense
*NL*
what
had
been
elaborated
by
the
spell
of
my
dreams
and
not
perceived
by
*NL*
my
senses
at
all
--
though
all
the
more
tempting
to
them
,
in
consequence
,
*NL*
more
different
from
anything
that
they
knew
--
it
was
that
which
recalled
*NL*
to
me
the
reality
of
these
visions
,
which
inflamed
my
desire
all
the
*NL*
more
by
seeming
to
hint
a
promise
that
my
desire
should
be
satisfied
.
*NL*
And
for
all
that
the
motive
force
of
my
exaltation
was
a
longing
for
*NL*
aesthetic
enjoyments
,
the
guide-books
ministered
even
more
to
it
than
*NL*
books
on
aesthetics
,
and
,
more
again
than
the
guide-books
,
the
railway
*NL*
time-tables
.
What
moved
me
was
the
thought
that
this
Florence
which
I
*NL*
could
see
,
so
near
and
yet
inaccessible
,
in
my
imagination
,
if
the
tract
*NL*
which
separated
it
from
me
,
in
myself
,
was
not
one
that
I
might
cross
,
*NL*
could
yet
be
reached
by
a
circuit
,
by
a
digression
,
were
I
to
take
*NL*
the
plain
,
terrestrial
path
.
When
I
repeated
to
myself
,
giving
thus
a
*NL*
special
value
to
what
I
was
going
to
see
,
that
Venice
was
the
``
School
of
*NL*
Giorgione
,
the
home
of
Titian
,
the
most
complete
museum
of
the
domestic
*NL*
architecture
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
''
I
felt
happy
indeed
.
As
I
was
even
*NL*
more
when
,
on
one
of
my
walks
,
as
I
stepped
out
briskly
on
account
*NL*
of
the
weather
,
which
,
after
several
days
of
a
precocious
spring
,
had
*NL*
relapsed
into
winter
-LRB-
like
the
weather
that
we
had
invariably
found
*NL*
awaiting
us
at
Combray
,
in
Holy
Week
-RRB-
,
--
seeing
upon
the
boulevards
that
*NL*
the
chestnut-trees
,
though
plunged
in
a
glacial
atmosphere
that
soaked
*NL*
through
them
like
a
stream
of
water
,
were
none
the
less
beginning
,
*NL*
punctual
guests
,
arrayed
already
for
the
party
,
and
admitting
no
*NL*
discouragement
,
to
shape
and
chisel
and
curve
in
its
frozen
lumps
the
*NL*
irrepressible
verdure
whose
steady
growth
the
abortive
power
of
the
*NL*
cold
might
hinder
but
could
not
succeed
in
restraining
--
I
reflected
that
*NL*
already
the
Ponte
Vecchio
was
heaped
high
with
an
abundance
of
hyacinths
*NL*
and
anemones
,
and
that
the
spring
sunshine
was
already
tinging
the
waves
*NL*
of
the
Grand
Canal
with
so
dusky
an
azure
,
with
emeralds
so
splendid
*NL*
that
when
they
washed
and
were
broken
against
the
foot
of
one
of
*NL*
Titian
's
paintings
they
could
vie
with
it
in
the
richness
of
their
*NL*
colouring
.
I
could
no
longer
contain
my
joy
when
my
father
,
in
the
*NL*
intervals
of
tapping
the
barometer
and
complaining
of
the
cold
,
began
*NL*
to
look
out
which
were
the
best
trains
,
and
when
I
understood
that
by
*NL*
making
one
's
way
,
after
luncheon
,
into
the
coal-grimed
laboratory
,
the
*NL*
wizard
's
cell
that
undertook
to
contrive
a
complete
transmutation
of
its
*NL*
surroundings
,
one
could
awaken
,
next
morning
,
in
the
city
of
marble
*NL*
and
gold
,
in
which
``
the
building
of
the
wall
was
of
jasper
and
the
*NL*
foundation
of
the
wall
an
emerald
.
''
So
that
it
and
the
City
of
the
*NL*
Lilies
were
not
just
artificial
scenes
which
I
could
set
up
at
my
*NL*
pleasure
in
front
of
my
imagination
,
but
did
actually
exist
at
a
certain
*NL*
distance
from
Paris
which
must
inevitably
be
traversed
if
I
wished
to
*NL*
see
them
,
at
their
appointed
place
on
the
earth
's
surface
,
and
at
no
*NL*
other
;
in
a
word
they
were
entirely
real
.
They
became
even
more
real
*NL*
to
me
when
my
father
,
by
saying
:
``
Well
,
you
can
stay
in
Venice
from
the
*NL*
20th
to
the
29th
,
and
reach
Florence
on
Easter
morning
,
''
made
them
both
*NL*
emerge
,
no
longer
only
from
the
abstraction
of
Space
,
but
from
that
*NL*
imaginary
Time
in
which
we
place
not
one
,
merely
,
but
several
of
*NL*
our
travels
at
once
,
which
do
not
greatly
tax
us
since
they
are
but
*NL*
possibilities
,
--
that
Time
which
reconstructs
itself
so
effectively
that
*NL*
one
can
spend
it
again
in
one
town
after
one
has
already
spent
it
in
*NL*
another
--
and
consecrated
to
them
some
of
those
actual
,
calendar
days
*NL*
which
are
certificates
of
the
genuineness
of
what
one
does
on
them
,
for
*NL*
those
unique
days
are
consumed
by
being
used
,
they
do
not
return
,
one
*NL*
can
not
live
them
again
here
when
one
has
lived
them
elsewhere
;
I
felt
*NL*
that
it
was
towards
the
week
that
would
begin
with
the
Monday
on
which
*NL*
the
laundress
was
to
bring
back
the
white
waistcoat
that
I
had
stained
*NL*
with
ink
,
that
they
were
hastening
to
busy
themselves
with
the
duty
*NL*
of
emerging
from
that
ideal
Time
in
which
they
did
not
,
as
yet
,
exist
,
*NL*
those
two
Queen
Cities
of
which
I
was
soon
to
be
able
,
by
the
most
*NL*
absorbing
kind
of
geometry
,
to
inscribe
the
domes
and
towers
on
a
*NL*
page
of
my
own
life
.
But
I
was
still
on
the
way
,
only
,
to
the
supreme
*NL*
pinnacle
of
happiness
;
I
reached
it
finally
-LRB-
for
not
until
then
did
the
*NL*
revelation
burst
upon
me
that
on
the
clattering
streets
,
reddened
by
the
*NL*
light
reflected
from
Giorgione
's
frescoes
,
it
was
not
,
as
I
had
,
despite
*NL*
so
many
promptings
,
continued
to
imagine
,
the
men
``
majestic
and
terrible
*NL*
as
the
sea
,
bearing
armour
that
gleamed
with
bronze
beneath
the
folds
*NL*
of
their
blood-red
cloaks
,
''
who
would
be
walking
in
Venice
next
week
,
on
*NL*
the
Easter
vigil
;
but
that
I
myself
might
be
the
minute
personage
whom
,
*NL*
in
an
enlarged
photograph
of
St.
Mark
's
that
had
been
lent
to
me
,
the
*NL*
operator
had
portrayed
,
in
a
bowler
hat
,
in
front
of
the
portico
-RRB-
,
when
*NL*
I
heard
my
father
say
:
``
It
must
be
pretty
cold
,
still
,
on
the
Grand
*NL*
Canal
;
whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
forget
to
pack
your
winter
greatcoat
and
*NL*
your
thick
suit
.
''
At
these
words
I
was
raised
to
a
sort
of
ecstasy
;
*NL*
a
thing
that
I
had
until
then
deemed
impossible
,
I
felt
myself
to
be
*NL*
penetrating
indeed
between
those
``
rocks
of
amethyst
,
like
a
reef
in
the
*NL*
Indian
Ocean
''
;
by
a
supreme
muscular
effort
,
a
long
way
in
excess
of
my
*NL*
real
strength
,
stripping
myself
,
as
of
a
shell
that
served
no
purpose
,
*NL*
of
the
air
in
my
own
room
which
surrounded
me
,
I
replaced
it
by
an
equal
*NL*
quantity
of
Venetian
air
,
that
marine
atmosphere
,
indescribable
and
*NL*
peculiar
as
the
atmosphere
of
the
dreams
which
my
imagination
had
*NL*
secreted
in
the
name
of
Venice
;
I
could
feel
at
work
within
me
a
*NL*
miraculous
disincarnation
;
it
was
at
once
accompanied
by
that
vague
*NL*
desire
to
vomit
which
one
feels
when
one
has
a
very
sore
throat
;
and
*NL*
they
had
to
put
me
to
bed
with
a
fever
so
persistent
that
the
doctor
*NL*
not
only
assured
my
parents
that
a
visit
,
that
spring
,
to
Florence
and
*NL*
Venice
was
absolutely
out
of
the
question
,
but
warned
their
that
,
even
*NL*
when
I
should
have
completely
recovered
,
I
must
,
for
at
least
a
year
,
*NL*
give
up
all
idea
of
travelling
,
and
be
kept
from
anything
that
was
*NL*
liable
to
excite
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
alas
,
he
forbade
also
,
most
categorically
,
my
being
allowed
to
go
*NL*
to
the
theatre
,
to
hear
Berma
;
the
sublime
artist
,
whose
genius
Bergotte
*NL*
had
proclaimed
,
might
,
by
introducing
me
to
something
else
that
was
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
as
important
and
as
beautiful
,
have
consoled
me
for
not
having
*NL*
been
to
Florence
and
Venice
,
for
not
going
to
Balbec
.
My
parents
had
*NL*
to
be
content
with
sending
me
,
every
day
,
to
the
Champs-Elysées
,
in
*NL*
the
custody
of
a
person
who
would
see
that
I
did
not
tire
myself
;
this
*NL*
person
was
none
other
than
Françoise
,
who
had
entered
our
service
*NL*
after
the
death
of
my
aunt
Léonie
.
Going
to
the
Champs-Elysées
I
found
*NL*
unendurable
.
If
only
Bergotte
had
described
the
place
in
one
of
his
*NL*
books
,
I
should
,
no
doubt
,
have
longed
to
see
and
to
know
it
,
like
so
*NL*
many
things
else
of
which
a
simulacrum
had
first
found
its
way
into
*NL*
my
imagination
.
That
kept
things
warm
,
made
them
live
,
gave
them
*NL*
personality
,
and
I
sought
then
to
find
their
counterpart
in
reality
,
*NL*
but
in
this
public
garden
there
was
nothing
that
attached
itself
to
my
*NL*
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
as
I
was
weary
of
our
usual
place
,
beside
the
wooden
horses
,
*NL*
Françoise
had
taken
me
for
an
excursion
--
across
the
frontier
guarded
at
*NL*
regular
intervals
by
the
little
bastions
of
the
barley-sugar
women
--
into
*NL*
those
neighbouring
but
foreign
regions
,
where
the
faces
of
the
*NL*
passers-by
were
strange
,
where
the
goat-carriage
went
past
;
then
she
had
*NL*
gone
away
to
lay
down
her
things
on
a
chair
that
stood
with
its
back
to
*NL*
a
shrubbery
of
laurels
;
while
I
waited
for
her
I
was
pacing
the
broad
*NL*
lawn
,
of
meagre
close-cropped
grass
already
faded
by
the
sun
,
dominated
,
*NL*
at
its
far
end
,
by
a
statue
rising
from
a
fountain
,
in
front
of
which
a
*NL*
little
girl
with
reddish
hair
was
playing
with
a
shuttlecock
;
when
,
from
*NL*
the
path
,
another
little
girl
,
who
was
putting
on
her
cloak
and
covering
*NL*
up
her
battledore
,
called
out
sharply
:
``
Good-bye
,
Gilberte
,
I
'm
going
*NL*
home
now
;
do
n't
forget
,
we
're
coming
to
you
this
evening
,
after
dinner
.
''
*NL*
The
name
Gilberte
passed
close
by
me
,
evoking
all
the
more
forcibly
her
*NL*
whom
it
labelled
in
that
it
did
not
merely
refer
to
her
,
as
one
speaks
*NL*
of
a
man
in
his
absence
,
but
was
directly
addressed
to
her
;
it
passed
*NL*
thus
close
by
me
,
in
action
,
so
to
speak
,
with
a
force
that
*NL*
increased
with
the
curve
of
its
trajectory
and
as
it
drew
near
to
*NL*
its
target
;
--
carrying
in
its
wake
,
I
could
feel
,
the
knowledge
,
the
*NL*
impression
of
her
to
whom
it
was
addressed
that
belonged
not
to
me
but
*NL*
to
the
friend
who
called
to
her
,
everything
that
,
while
she
uttered
the
*NL*
words
,
she
more
or
less
vividly
reviewed
,
possessed
in
her
memory
,
of
*NL*
their
daily
intimacy
,
of
the
visits
that
they
paid
to
each
other
,
of
*NL*
that
unknown
existence
which
was
all
the
more
inaccessible
,
all
the
more
*NL*
painful
to
me
from
being
,
conversely
,
so
familiar
,
so
tractable
to
this
*NL*
happy
girl
who
let
her
message
brush
past
me
without
my
being
able
to
*NL*
penetrate
its
surface
,
who
flung
it
on
the
air
with
a
light-hearted
cry
:
*NL*
letting
float
in
the
atmosphere
the
delicious
attar
which
that
message
*NL*
had
distilled
,
by
touching
them
with
precision
,
from
certain
invisible
*NL*
points
in
Mlle.
Swann
's
life
,
from
the
evening
to
come
,
as
it
would
be
,
*NL*
after
dinner
,
at
her
home
,
--
forming
,
on
its
celestial
passage
through
*NL*
the
midst
of
the
children
and
their
nursemaids
,
a
little
cloud
,
*NL*
exquisitely
coloured
,
like
the
cloud
that
,
curling
over
one
of
Poussin
's
*NL*
gardens
,
reflects
minutely
,
like
a
cloud
in
the
opera
,
teeming
with
*NL*
chariots
and
horses
,
some
apparition
of
the
life
of
the
gods
;
casting
,
*NL*
finally
,
on
that
ragged
grass
,
at
the
spot
on
which
she
stood
-LRB-
at
once
a
*NL*
scrap
of
withered
lawn
and
a
moment
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fair
player
,
*NL*
who
continued
to
beat
up
and
catch
her
shuttlecock
until
a
governess
,
*NL*
with
a
blue
feather
in
her
hat
,
had
called
her
away
-RRB-
a
marvellous
little
*NL*
band
of
light
,
of
the
colour
of
heliotrope
,
spread
over
the
lawn
like
a
*NL*
carpet
on
which
I
could
not
tire
of
treading
to
and
fro
with
lingering
*NL*
feet
,
nostalgic
and
profane
,
while
Françoise
shouted
:
``
Come
on
,
button
*NL*
up
your
coat
,
look
,
and
let
's
get
away
!
''
and
I
remarked
for
the
first
*NL*
time
how
common
her
speech
was
,
and
that
she
had
,
alas
,
no
blue
feather
*NL*
in
her
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
would
_
she
_
come
again
to
the
Champs-Elysées
?
Next
day
she
was
*NL*
not
there
;
but
I
saw
her
on
the
following
days
;
I
spent
all
my
time
*NL*
revolving
round
the
spot
where
she
was
at
play
with
her
friends
,
to
such
*NL*
effect
that
once
,
when
,
they
found
,
they
were
not
enough
to
make
up
a
*NL*
prisoner
's
base
,
she
sent
one
of
them
to
ask
me
if
I
cared
to
complete
*NL*
their
side
,
and
from
that
day
I
played
with
her
whenever
she
came
.
*NL*
But
this
did
not
happen
every
day
;
there
were
days
when
she
had
*NL*
been
prevented
from
coming
by
her
lessons
,
by
her
catechism
,
by
a
*NL*
luncheon-party
,
by
the
whole
of
that
life
,
separated
from
my
own
,
which
*NL*
twice
only
,
condensed
into
the
name
of
Gilberte
,
I
had
felt
pass
so
*NL*
painfully
close
to
me
,
in
the
hawthorn
lane
near
Combray
and
on
the
*NL*
grass
of
the
Champs-Elysées
.
On
such
days
she
would
have
told
us
*NL*
beforehand
that
we
should
not
see
her
;
if
it
were
because
of
her
*NL*
lessons
,
she
would
say
:
``
It
is
too
tiresome
,
I
sha
'n'
t
be
able
to
come
*NL*
to-morrow
;
you
will
all
be
enjoying
yourselves
here
without
me
,
''
with
an
*NL*
air
of
regret
which
to
some
extent
consoled
me
;
if
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
she
had
been
invited
to
a
party
,
and
I
,
not
knowing
this
,
asked
her
*NL*
whether
she
was
coming
to
play
with
us
,
she
would
reply
:
``
Indeed
I
hope
*NL*
not
!
Indeed
I
hope
Mamma
will
let
me
go
to
my
friend
's
.
''
But
on
these
*NL*
days
I
did
at
least
know
that
I
should
not
see
her
,
whereas
on
others
,
*NL*
without
any
warning
,
her
mother
would
take
her
for
a
drive
,
or
some
such
*NL*
thing
,
and
next
day
she
would
say
:
``
Oh
,
yes
!
I
went
out
with
Mamma
,
''
*NL*
as
though
it
had
been
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
,
and
not
the
*NL*
greatest
possible
misfortune
for
some
one
else
.
There
were
also
the
days
*NL*
of
bad
weather
on
which
her
governess
,
afraid
,
on
her
own
account
,
of
*NL*
the
rain
,
would
not
bring
Gilberte
to
the
Champs-Elysées
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
,
if
the
heavens
were
doubtful
,
from
early
morning
I
would
not
*NL*
cease
to
interrogate
them
,
observing
all
the
omens
.
If
I
saw
the
lady
*NL*
opposite
,
just
inside
her
window
,
putting
on
her
hat
,
I
would
say
to
*NL*
myself
:
``
That
lady
is
going
out
;
it
must
,
therefore
,
be
weather
in
which
*NL*
one
can
go
out
.
Why
should
not
Gilberte
do
the
same
as
that
lady
?
''
But
*NL*
the
day
grew
dark
.
My
mother
said
that
it
might
clear
again
,
that
one
*NL*
burst
of
sunshine
would
be
enough
,
but
that
more
probably
it
would
rain
;
*NL*
and
if
it
rained
,
of
what
use
would
it
be
to
go
to
the
Champs-Elysées
?
*NL*
And
so
,
from
breakfast-time
,
my
anxious
eyes
never
left
the
uncertain
,
*NL*
clouded
sky
.
It
remained
dark
:
Outside
the
window
,
the
balcony
was
grey
.
*NL*
Suddenly
,
on
its
sullen
stone
,
I
did
not
indeed
see
a
less
negative
*NL*
colour
,
but
I
felt
as
it
were
an
effort
towards
a
less
negative
colour
,
*NL*
the
pulsation
of
a
hesitating
ray
that
struggled
to
discharge
its
light
.
*NL*
A
moment
later
the
balcony
was
as
pale
and
luminous
as
a
standing
water
*NL*
at
dawn
,
and
a
thousand
shadows
from
the
iron-work
of
its
balustrade
had
*NL*
come
to
rest
on
it
.
A
breath
of
wind
dispersed
them
;
the
stone
grew
*NL*
dark
again
,
but
,
like
tamed
creatures
,
they
returned
;
they
began
,
*NL*
imperceptibly
,
to
grow
lighter
,
and
by
one
of
those
continuous
*NL*
crescendos
,
such
as
,
in
music
,
at
the
end
of
an
overture
,
carry
a
single
*NL*
note
to
the
extreme
fortissimo
,
making
it
pass
rapidly
through
all
the
*NL*
intermediate
stages
,
I
saw
it
attain
to
that
fixed
,
unalterable
gold
of
*NL*
fine
days
,
on
which
the
sharply
cut
shadows
of
the
wrought
iron
of
the
*NL*
balustrade
were
outlined
in
black
like
a
capricious
vegetation
,
with
a
*NL*
fineness
in
the
delineation
of
their
smallest
details
which
seemed
to
*NL*
indicate
a
deliberate
application
,
an
artist
's
satisfaction
,
and
with
so
*NL*
much
relief
,
so
velvety
a
bloom
in
the
restfulness
of
their
sombre
*NL*
and
happy
mass
that
in
truth
those
large
and
leafy
shadows
which
lay
*NL*
reflected
on
that
lake
of
sunshine
seemed
aware
that
they
were
pledges
*NL*
of
happiness
and
peace
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brief
,
fading
ivy
,
climbing
,
fugitive
flora
,
the
most
colourless
,
the
*NL*
most
depressing
,
to
many
minds
,
of
all
that
creep
on
walls
or
decorate
*NL*
windows
;
to
me
the
dearest
of
them
all
,
from
the
day
when
it
appeared
*NL*
upon
our
balcony
,
like
the
very
shadow
of
the
presence
of
Gilberte
,
*NL*
who
was
perhaps
already
in
the
Champs-Elysées
,
and
as
soon
as
I
arrived
*NL*
there
would
greet
me
with
:
``
Let
's
begin
at
once
.
You
are
on
my
side
.
''
*NL*
Frail
,
swept
away
by
a
breath
,
but
at
the
same
time
in
harmony
,
not
with
*NL*
the
season
,
with
the
hour
;
a
promise
of
that
immediate
pleasure
which
*NL*
the
day
will
deny
or
fulfil
,
and
thereby
of
the
one
paramount
immediate
*NL*
pleasure
,
the
pleasure
of
loving
and
of
being
loved
;
more
soft
,
*NL*
more
warm
upon
the
stone
than
even
moss
is
;
alive
,
a
ray
of
sunshine
*NL*
sufficing
for
its
birth
,
and
for
the
birth
of
joy
,
even
in
the
heart
of
*NL*
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
those
days
when
all
other
vegetation
had
disappeared
,
when
the
*NL*
fine
jerkins
of
green
leather
which
covered
the
trunks
of
the
old
trees
*NL*
were
hidden
beneath
the
snow
;
after
the
snow
had
ceased
to
fall
,
but
*NL*
when
the
sky
was
still
too
much
overcast
for
me
to
hope
that
Gilberte
*NL*
would
venture
out
,
then
suddenly
--
inspiring
my
mother
to
say
:
``
Look
,
*NL*
it
's
quite
fine
now
;
I
think
you
might
perhaps
try
going
to
the
*NL*
Champs-Elysées
after
all
.
''
--
On
the
mantle
of
snow
that
swathed
the
*NL*
balcony
,
the
sun
had
appeared
and
was
stitching
seams
of
gold
,
with
*NL*
embroidered
patches
of
dark
shadow
.
That
day
we
found
no
one
there
,
or
*NL*
else
a
solitary
girl
,
on
the
point
of
departure
,
who
assured
me
that
*NL*
Gilberte
was
not
coming
.
The
chairs
,
deserted
by
the
imposing
but
*NL*
uninspiring
company
of
governesses
,
stood
empty
.
Only
,
near
the
grass
,
*NL*
was
sitting
a
lady
of
uncertain
age
who
came
in
all
weathers
,
dressed
*NL*
always
in
an
identical
style
,
splendid
and
sombre
,
to
make
whose
*NL*
acquaintance
I
would
have
,
at
that
period
,
sacrificed
,
had
it
lain
in
my
*NL*
power
,
all
the
greatest
opportunities
in
my
life
to
come
.
For
Gilberte
*NL*
went
up
every
day
to
speak
to
her
;
she
used
to
ask
Gilberte
for
news
of
*NL*
her
``
dearest
mother
''
and
it
struck
me
that
,
if
I
had
known
her
,
I
should
*NL*
have
been
for
Gilberte
some
one
wholly
different
,
some
one
who
knew
*NL*
people
in
her
parents
'
world
.
While
her
grandchildren
played
together
at
*NL*
a
little
distance
,
she
would
sit
and
read
the
Débats
,
which
she
called
*NL*
``
My
old
_
Débats
_
!
''
as
,
with
an
aristocratic
familiarity
,
she
would
say
,
*NL*
speaking
of
the
police-sergeant
or
the
woman
who
let
the
chairs
,
``
My
*NL*
old
friend
the
police-sergeant
,
''
or
``
The
chair-keeper
and
I
,
who
are
old
*NL*
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Françoise
found
it
too
cold
to
stand
about
,
so
we
walked
to
the
Pont
*NL*
de
la
Concorde
to
see
the
Seine
frozen
over
,
on
to
which
everyone
,
even
*NL*
children
,
walked
fearlessly
,
as
though
upon
an
enormous
whale
,
stranded
,
*NL*
defenceless
,
and
about
to
be
cut
up
.
We
returned
to
the
Champs-Elysées
;
*NL*
I
was
growing
sick
with
misery
between
the
motionless
wooden
horses
and
*NL*
the
white
lawn
,
caught
in
a
net
of
black
paths
from
which
the
snow
had
*NL*
been
cleared
,
while
the
statue
that
surmounted
it
held
in
its
hand
a
*NL*
long
pendent
icicle
which
seemed
to
explain
its
gesture
.
The
old
lady
*NL*
herself
,
having
folded
up
her
_
Débats
_
,
asked
a
passing
nursemaid
*NL*
the
time
,
thanking
her
with
``
How
very
good
of
you
!
''
then
begged
the
*NL*
road-sweeper
to
tell
her
grandchildren
to
come
,
as
she
felt
cold
,
adding
*NL*
``
A
thousand
thanks
.
I
am
sorry
to
give
you
so
much
trouble
!
''
Suddenly
*NL*
the
sky
was
rent
in
two
:
between
the
punch-and-judy
and
the
horses
,
*NL*
against
the
opening
horizon
,
I
had
just
seen
,
like
a
miraculous
sign
,
*NL*
Mademoiselle
's
blue
feather
.
And
now
Gilberte
was
running
at
full
speed
*NL*
towards
me
,
sparkling
and
rosy
beneath
a
cap
trimmed
with
fur
,
enlivened
*NL*
by
the
cold
,
by
being
late
,
by
her
anxiety
for
a
game
;
shortly
before
*NL*
she
reached
me
,
she
slipped
on
a
piece
of
ice
and
,
either
to
regain
her
*NL*
balance
,
or
because
it
appeared
to
her
graceful
,
or
else
pretending
*NL*
that
she
was
on
skates
,
it
was
with
outstretched
arms
that
she
smilingly
*NL*
advanced
,
as
though
to
embrace
me
.
``
Bravo
!
bravo
!
that
's
splendid
;
*NL*
`
topping
,
'
I
should
say
,
like
you
--
`
sporting
,
'
I
suppose
I
ought
to
say
,
*NL*
only
I
'm
a
hundred-and-one
,
a
woman
of
the
old
school
,
''
exclaimed
the
*NL*
lady
,
uttering
,
on
behalf
of
the
voiceless
Champs-Elysées
,
their
thanks
*NL*
to
Gilberte
for
having
come
,
without
letting
herself
be
frightened
*NL*
away
by
the
weather
.
``
You
are
like
me
,
faithful
at
all
costs
to
our
old
*NL*
Champs-Elysées
;
we
are
two
brave
souls
!
You
would
n't
believe
me
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
,
if
I
told
you
that
I
love
them
,
even
like
this
.
This
snow
-LRB-
I
know
,
*NL*
you
'll
laugh
at
me
-RRB-
,
it
makes
me
think
of
ermine
!
''
And
the
old
lady
*NL*
began
to
laugh
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
of
these
days
--
to
which
the
snow
,
a
symbol
of
the
powers
that
*NL*
were
able
to
deprive
me
of
the
sight
of
Gilberte
,
imparted
the
sadness
*NL*
of
a
day
of
separation
,
almost
the
aspect
of
a
day
of
departure
,
because
*NL*
it
changed
the
outward
form
and
almost
forbade
the
use
of
the
customary
*NL*
scene
of
our
only
encounters
,
now
altered
,
covered
,
as
it
were
,
in
*NL*
dust-sheets
--
that
day
,
none
the
less
,
marked
a
stage
in
the
progress
of
*NL*
my
love
,
for
it
was
,
in
a
sense
,
the
first
sorrow
that
she
was
to
share
*NL*
with
me
.
There
were
only
our
two
selves
of
our
little
company
,
and
to
*NL*
be
thus
alone
with
her
was
not
merely
like
a
beginning
of
intimacy
,
but
*NL*
also
on
her
part
--
as
though
she
had
come
there
solely
to
please
me
,
and
*NL*
in
such
weather
--
it
seemed
to
me
as
touching
as
if
,
on
one
of
those
days
*NL*
on
which
she
had
been
invited
to
a
party
,
she
had
given
it
up
in
order
*NL*
to
come
to
me
in
the
Champs-Elysées
;
I
acquired
more
confidence
in
the
*NL*
vitality
,
in
the
future
of
a
friendship
which
could
remain
so
much
alive
*NL*
amid
the
torpor
,
the
solitude
,
the
decay
of
our
surroundings
;
and
while
*NL*
she
dropped
pellets
of
snow
down
my
neck
,
I
smiled
lovingly
at
what
*NL*
seemed
to
me
at
once
a
predilection
that
she
shewed
for
me
in
thus
*NL*
tolerating
me
as
her
travelling
companion
in
this
new
,
this
wintry
land
,
*NL*
and
a
sort
of
loyalty
to
me
which
she
preserved
through
evil
times
.
*NL*
Presently
,
one
after
another
,
like
shyly
bopping
sparrows
,
her
friends
*NL*
arrived
,
black
against
the
snow
.
We
got
ready
to
play
and
,
since
this
*NL*
day
which
had
begun
so
sadly
was
destined
to
end
in
joy
,
as
I
went
up
,
*NL*
before
the
game
started
,
to
the
friend
with
the
sharp
voice
whom
I
had
*NL*
heard
,
that
first
day
,
calling
Gilberte
by
name
,
she
said
to
me
:
``
No
,
*NL*
no
,
I
'm
sure
you
'd
much
rather
be
in
Gilberte
's
camp
;
besides
,
look
,
*NL*
she
's
signalling
to
you
.
''
She
was
in
fact
summoning
me
to
cross
the
*NL*
snowy
lawn
to
her
camp
,
to
`
take
the
field
,
'
which
the
sun
,
by
casting
*NL*
over
it
a
rosy
gleam
,
the
metallic
lustre
of
old
and
worn
brocades
,
had
*NL*
turned
into
a
Field
of
the
Cloth
of
Gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
day
,
which
I
had
begun
with
so
many
misgivings
,
was
,
as
it
*NL*
happened
,
one
of
the
few
on
which
I
was
not
unduly
wretched
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
although
I
no
longer
thought
,
now
,
of
anything
save
not
to
let
a
*NL*
single
day
pass
without
seeing
Gilberte
-LRB-
so
much
so
that
once
,
when
my
*NL*
grandmother
had
not
come
home
by
dinner-time
,
I
could
not
resist
the
*NL*
instinctive
reflection
that
,
if
she
had
been
run
over
in
the
street
*NL*
and
killed
,
I
should
not
for
some
time
be
allowed
to
play
in
the
*NL*
Champs-Elysées
;
when
one
is
in
love
one
has
no
love
left
for
anyone
-RRB-
,
*NL*
yet
those
moments
which
I
spent
in
her
company
,
for
which
I
had
waited
*NL*
with
so
much
impatience
all
night
and
morning
,
for
which
I
had
quivered
*NL*
with
excitement
,
to
which
I
would
have
sacrificed
everything
else
in
the
*NL*
world
,
were
by
no
means
happy
moments
;
well
did
I
know
it
,
for
they
*NL*
were
the
only
moments
in
my
life
on
which
I
concentrated
a
scrupulous
,
*NL*
undistracted
attention
,
and
yet
I
could
not
discover
in
them
one
atom
*NL*
of
pleasure
.
All
the
time
that
I
was
away
from
Gilberte
,
I
wanted
to
see
*NL*
her
,
because
,
having
incessantly
sought
to
form
a
mental
picture
of
her
,
*NL*
I
was
unable
,
in
the
end
,
to
do
so
,
and
did
not
know
exactly
to
what
my
*NL*
love
corresponded
.
Besides
,
she
had
never
yet
told
me
that
she
loved
me
.
*NL*
Far
from
it
,
she
had
often
boasted
that
she
knew
other
little
boys
whom
*NL*
she
preferred
to
myself
,
that
I
was
a
good
companion
,
with
whom
she
was
*NL*
always
willing
to
play
,
although
I
was
too
absent-minded
,
not
attentive
*NL*
enough
to
the
game
.
Moreover
,
she
had
often
shewn
signs
of
apparent
*NL*
coldness
towards
me
,
which
might
have
shaken
my
faith
that
I
was
for
her
*NL*
a
creature
different
from
the
rest
,
had
that
faith
been
founded
upon
a
*NL*
love
that
Gilberte
had
felt
for
me
,
and
not
,
as
was
the
case
,
upon
*NL*
the
love
that
I
felt
for
her
,
which
strengthened
its
resistance
to
the
*NL*
assaults
of
doubt
by
making
it
depend
entirely
upon
the
manner
in
which
*NL*
I
was
obliged
,
by
an
internal
compulsion
,
to
think
of
Gilberte
.
But
my
*NL*
feelings
with
regard
to
her
I
had
never
yet
ventured
to
express
to
her
*NL*
in
words
.
Of
course
,
on
every
page
of
my
exercise-books
,
I
wrote
out
,
*NL*
in
endless
repetition
,
her
name
and
address
,
but
at
the
sight
of
those
*NL*
vague
lines
which
I
might
trace
,
without
her
having
to
think
,
on
that
*NL*
account
,
of
me
,
I
felt
discouraged
,
because
they
spoke
to
me
,
not
of
*NL*
Gilberte
,
who
would
never
so
much
as
see
them
,
but
of
my
own
desire
,
*NL*
which
they
seemed
to
shew
me
in
its
true
colours
,
as
something
purely
*NL*
personal
,
unreal
,
tedious
and
ineffective
.
The
most
important
thing
*NL*
was
that
we
should
see
each
other
,
Gilberte
and
I
,
and
should
have
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
making
a
mutual
confession
of
our
love
which
,
until
then
,
*NL*
would
not
officially
-LRB-
so
to
speak
-RRB-
have
begun
.
Doubtless
the
various
*NL*
reasons
which
made
me
so
impatient
to
see
her
would
have
appeared
less
*NL*
urgent
to
a
grown
man
.
As
life
goes
on
,
we
acquire
such
adroitness
in
*NL*
the
culture
of
our
pleasures
,
that
we
content
ourselves
with
that
which
*NL*
we
derive
from
thinking
of
a
woman
,
as
I
was
thinking
of
Gilberte
,
*NL*
without
troubling
ourselves
to
ascertain
whether
the
image
corresponds
*NL*
to
the
reality
,
--
and
with
the
pleasure
of
loving
her
,
without
needing
to
*NL*
be
sure
,
also
,
that
she
loves
us
;
or
again
that
we
renounce
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
confessing
our
passion
for
her
,
so
as
to
preserve
and
enhance
the
*NL*
passion
that
she
has
for
us
,
like
those
Japanese
gardeners
who
,
to
*NL*
obtain
one
perfect
blossom
,
will
sacrifice
the
rest
.
But
at
the
period
*NL*
when
I
was
in
love
with
Gilberte
,
I
still
believed
that
Love
did
really
*NL*
exist
,
apart
from
ourselves
;
that
,
allowing
us
,
at
the
most
,
to
surmount
*NL*
the
obstacles
in
our
way
,
it
offered
us
its
blessings
in
an
order
in
*NL*
which
we
were
not
free
to
make
the
least
alteration
;
it
seemed
to
me
*NL*
that
if
I
had
,
on
my
own
initiative
,
substituted
for
the
sweetness
of
*NL*
a
confession
a
pretence
of
indifference
,
I
should
not
only
have
been
*NL*
depriving
myself
of
one
of
the
joys
of
which
I
had
most
often
dreamed
,
*NL*
I
should
have
been
fabricating
,
of
my
own
free
will
,
a
love
that
was
*NL*
artificial
and
without
value
,
that
bore
no
relation
to
the
truth
,
whose
*NL*
mysterious
and
foreordained
ways
I
should
thus
have
been
declining
to
*NL*
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
I
arrived
at
the
Champs-Elysées
,
--
and
,
as
at
first
sight
*NL*
it
appeared
,
was
in
a
position
to
confront
my
love
,
so
as
to
make
it
*NL*
undergo
the
necessary
modifications
,
with
its
living
and
independent
*NL*
cause
--
as
soon
as
I
was
in
the
presence
of
that
Gilberte
Swann
on
the
*NL*
sight
of
whom
I
had
counted
to
revive
the
images
that
my
tired
memory
*NL*
had
lost
and
could
not
find
again
,
of
that
Gilberte
Swann
with
whom
I
*NL*
had
been
playing
the
day
before
,
and
whom
I
had
just
been
prompted
to
*NL*
greet
,
and
then
to
recognise
,
by
a
blind
instinct
like
that
which
,
when
*NL*
we
are
walking
,
sets
one
foot
before
the
other
,
without
giving
us
time
*NL*
to
think
what
we
are
doing
,
then
at
once
it
became
as
though
she
and
the
*NL*
little
girl
who
had
inspired
my
dreams
had
been
two
different
people
.
*NL*
If
,
for
instance
,
I
had
retained
in
my
memory
overnight
two
fiery
eyes
*NL*
above
plump
and
rosy
cheeks
,
Gilberte
's
face
would
now
offer
me
-LRB-
and
*NL*
with
emphasis
-RRB-
something
that
I
distinctly
had
not
remembered
,
a
*NL*
certain
sharpening
and
prolongation
of
the
nose
which
,
instantaneously
*NL*
associating
itself
with
certain
others
of
her
features
,
assumed
the
*NL*
importance
of
those
characteristics
which
,
in
natural
history
,
are
used
*NL*
to
define
a
species
,
and
transformed
her
into
a
little
girl
of
the
kind
*NL*
that
have
sharpened
profiles
.
While
I
was
making
myself
ready
to
take
*NL*
advantage
of
this
long
expected
moment
,
and
to
surrender
myself
to
the
*NL*
impression
of
Gilberte
which
I
had
prepared
beforehand
but
could
no
*NL*
longer
find
in
my
head
,
to
an
extent
which
would
enable
me
,
during
the
*NL*
long
hours
which
I
must
spend
alone
,
to
be
certain
that
it
was
indeed
*NL*
herself
whom
I
had
in
mind
,
that
it
was
indeed
my
love
for
her
that
I
*NL*
was
gradually
making
grow
,
as
a
book
grows
when
one
is
writing
it
,
she
*NL*
threw
me
a
ball
;
and
,
like
the
idealist
philosopher
whose
body
takes
*NL*
account
of
the
external
world
in
the
reality
of
which
his
intellect
*NL*
declines
to
believe
,
the
same
self
which
had
made
me
salute
her
before
I
*NL*
had
identified
her
now
urged
me
to
catch
the
ball
that
she
tossed
to
me
*NL*
-LRB-
as
though
she
had
been
a
companion
,
with
whom
I
had
come
to
play
,
and
*NL*
not
a
sister-soul
with
whom
my
soul
had
come
to
be
united
-RRB-
,
made
me
,
*NL*
out
of
politeness
,
until
the
time
came
when
she
had
to
I
go
,
address
*NL*
a
thousand
polite
and
trivial
remarks
to
her
,
and
so
prevented
me
both
*NL*
from
keeping
a
silence
in
which
I
might
at
last
have
laid
my
hand
upon
*NL*
the
indispensable
,
escaped
idea
,
and
from
uttering
the
words
which
might
*NL*
have
made
that
definite
progress
in
the
course
of
our
love
on
which
I
*NL*
was
always
obliged
to
count
only
for
the
following
afternoon
.
There
was
,
*NL*
however
,
an
occasional
development
.
One
day
,
we
had
gone
with
Gilberte
*NL*
to
the
stall
of
our
own
special
vendor
,
who
was
always
particularly
*NL*
nice
to
us
,
since
it
was
to
her
that
M.
Swann
used
to
send
for
his
*NL*
gingerbread
,
of
which
,
for
reasons
of
health
-LRB-
he
suffered
from
a
racial
*NL*
eczema
,
and
from
the
constipation
of
the
prophets
-RRB-
,
he
consumed
a
great
*NL*
quantity
,
--
Gilberte
pointed
out
to
me
with
a
laugh
two
little
boys
who
*NL*
were
like
the
little
artist
and
the
little
naturalist
in
the
children
's
*NL*
storybooks
.
For
one
of
them
would
not
have
a
red
stick
of
rock
because
*NL*
he
preferred
the
purple
,
while
the
other
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
*NL*
refused
a
plum
which
his
nurse
was
buying
for
him
,
because
,
as
he
*NL*
finally
explained
in
passionate
tones
:
``
I
want
the
other
plum
;
it
's
got
*NL*
a
worm
in
it
!
''
I
purchased
two
ha
`
penny
marbles
.
With
admiring
eyes
I
*NL*
saw
,
luminous
and
imprisoned
in
a
bowl
by
themselves
,
the
agate
marbles
*NL*
which
seemed
precious
to
me
because
they
were
as
fair
and
smiling
as
*NL*
little
girls
,
and
because
they
cost
five-pence
each
.
Gilberte
,
who
was
*NL*
given
a
great
deal
more
pocket
money
than
I
ever
had
,
asked
me
which
I
*NL*
thought
the
prettiest
.
They
were
as
transparent
,
as
liquid-seeming
as
*NL*
life
itself
.
I
would
not
have
had
her
sacrifice
a
single
one
of
them
.
*NL*
I
should
have
liked
her
to
be
able
to
buy
them
,
to
liberate
them
all
.
*NL*
Still
,
I
pointed
out
one
that
had
the
same
colour
as
her
eyes
.
Gilberte
*NL*
took
it
,
turned
it
about
until
it
shone
with
a
ray
of
gold
,
fondled
it
,
*NL*
paid
its
ransom
,
but
at
once
handed
me
her
captive
,
saying
:
``
Take
it
;
it
*NL*
is
for
you
,
I
give
it
to
you
,
keep
it
to
remind
yourself
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
time
,
being
still
obsessed
by
the
desire
to
hear
Berma
in
*NL*
classic
drama
,
I
had
asked
her
whether
she
had
not
a
copy
of
a
pamphlet
*NL*
in
which
Bergotte
spoke
of
Racine
,
and
which
was
now
out
of
print
.
She
*NL*
had
told
me
to
let
her
know
the
exact
title
of
it
,
and
that
evening
*NL*
I
had
sent
her
a
little
telegram
,
writing
on
its
envelope
the
name
,
*NL*
Gilberte
Swann
,
which
I
had
so
often
,
traced
in
my
exercise-books
.
Next
*NL*
day
she
brought
me
in
a
parcel
tied
with
pink
bows
and
sealed
with
white
*NL*
wax
,
the
pamphlet
,
a
copy
of
which
she
had
managed
to
find
.
``
You
see
,
it
*NL*
is
what
you
asked
me
for
,
''
she
said
,
taking
from
her
muff
the
telegram
*NL*
that
I
had
sent
her
.
But
in
the
address
on
the
pneumatic
message
--
which
,
*NL*
only
yesterday
,
was
nothing
,
was
merely
a
`
little
blue
'
that
I
had
*NL*
written
,
and
,
after
a
messenger
had
delivered
it
to
Gilberte
's
porter
*NL*
and
a
servant
had
taken
it
to
her
in
her
room
,
had
become
a
thing
*NL*
without
value
or
distinction
,
one
of
the
`
little
blues
'
that
she
had
*NL*
received
in
the
course
of
the
day
--
I
had
difficulty
in
recognising
*NL*
the
futile
,
straggling
lines
of
my
own
handwriting
beneath
the
circles
*NL*
stamped
on
it
at
the
post-office
,
the
inscriptions
added
in
pencil
by
*NL*
a
postman
,
signs
of
effectual
realisation
,
seals
of
the
external
world
,
*NL*
violet
bands
symbolical
of
life
itself
,
which
for
the
first
time
came
to
*NL*
espouse
,
to
maintain
,
to
raise
,
to
rejoice
my
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
there
was
another
day
on
which
she
said
to
me
:
``
You
know
,
you
may
*NL*
call
me
`
Gilberte
'
;
in
any
case
,
I
'm
going
to
call
you
by
your
first
*NL*
name
.
It
's
too
silly
not
to
.
''
Yet
she
continued
for
a
while
to
address
*NL*
me
by
the
more
formal
'
_
vous
_
,
'
and
,
when
I
drew
her
attention
to
this
,
*NL*
smiled
,
and
composing
,
constructing
a
phrase
like
those
that
are
put
*NL*
into
the
grammar-books
of
foreign
languages
with
no
other
object
than
to
*NL*
teach
us
to
make
use
of
a
new
word
,
ended
it
with
my
Christian
name
.
And
*NL*
when
I
recalled
,
later
,
what
I
had
felt
at
the
time
,
I
could
distinguish
*NL*
the
impression
of
having
been
held
,
for
a
moment
,
in
her
mouth
,
myself
,
*NL*
naked
,
without
,
any
longer
,
any
of
the
social
qualifications
which
*NL*
belonged
equally
to
her
other
companions
and
,
when
she
used
my
surname
,
*NL*
to
my
parents
,
accessories
of
which
her
lips
--
by
the
effort
that
she
*NL*
made
,
a
little
after
her
father
's
manner
,
to
articulate
the
words
to
*NL*
which
she
wished
to
give
a
special
value
--
had
the
air
of
stripping
,
of
*NL*
divesting
me
,
as
one
peels
the
skin
from
a
fruit
of
which
one
is
going
*NL*
to
put
only
the
pulp
into
one
's
mouth
,
while
her
glance
,
adapting
itself
*NL*
to
the
same
new
degree
of
intimacy
as
her
speech
,
fell
on
me
also
more
*NL*
directly
,
not
without
testifying
to
the
consciousness
,
the
pleasure
,
*NL*
even
the
gratitude
that
it
felt
,
accompanying
itself
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
actual
moment
,
I
was
not
able
to
appreciate
the
worth
of
*NL*
these
new
pleasures
.
They
were
given
,
not
by
the
little
girl
whom
I
*NL*
loved
,
to
me
who
loved
her
,
but
by
the
other
,
her
with
whom
I
used
to
*NL*
play
,
to
my
other
self
,
who
possessed
neither
the
memory
of
the
true
*NL*
Gilberte
,
nor
the
fixed
heart
which
alone
could
have
known
the
value
*NL*
of
a
happiness
for
which
it
alone
had
longed
.
Even
after
I
had
returned
*NL*
home
I
did
not
taste
them
,
since
,
every
day
,
the
necessity
which
made
*NL*
me
hope
that
on
the
morrow
I
should
arrive
at
the
clear
,
calm
,
happy
*NL*
contemplation
of
Gilberte
,
that
she
would
at
last
confess
her
love
*NL*
for
me
,
explaining
to
me
the
reasons
by
which
she
had
been
obliged
,
*NL*
hitherto
,
to
conceal
it
,
that
same
necessity
forced
me
to
regard
the
*NL*
past
as
of
no
account
,
to
look
ahead
of
me
only
,
to
consider
the
little
*NL*
advantages
that
she
had
given
me
not
in
themselves
and
as
if
they
were
*NL*
self-sufficient
,
but
like
fresh
rungs
of
the
ladder
on
which
I
might
*NL*
set
my
feet
,
which
were
going
to
allow
me
to
advance
a
step
further
and
*NL*
finally
to
attain
the
happiness
which
I
had
not
yet
encountered
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
at
times
,
she
shewed
me
these
marks
of
her
affection
,
she
troubled
*NL*
me
also
by
seeming
not
to
be
pleased
to
see
me
,
and
this
happened
often
*NL*
on
the
very
days
on
which
I
had
most
counted
for
the
realisation
of
my
*NL*
hopes
.
I
was
sure
that
Gilberte
was
coming
to
the
Champs-Elysées
,
and
*NL*
I
felt
an
elation
which
seemed
merely
the
anticipation
of
a
great
*NL*
happiness
when
--
going
into
the
drawing-room
in
the
morning
to
kiss
*NL*
Mamma
,
who
was
already
dressed
to
go
out
,
the
coils
of
her
black
hair
*NL*
elaborately
built
up
,
and
her
beautiful
hands
,
plump
and
white
,
fragrant
*NL*
still
with
soap
--
I
had
been
apprised
,
by
seeing
a
column
of
dust
*NL*
standing
by
itself
in
the
air
above
the
piano
,
and
by
hearing
a
*NL*
barrel-organ
playing
,
beneath
the
window
,
_
En
revenant
de
la
revue
_
,
*NL*
that
the
winter
had
received
,
until
nightfall
,
an
unexpected
,
radiant
*NL*
visit
from
a
day
of
spring
.
While
we
sat
at
luncheon
,
by
opening
her
*NL*
window
,
the
lady
opposite
had
sent
packing
,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
*NL*
from
beside
my
chair
--
to
sweep
in
a
single
stride
over
the
whole
width
*NL*
of
our
dining-room
--
a
sunbeam
which
had
lain
down
there
for
its
midday
*NL*
rest
and
returned
to
continue
it
there
a
moment
later
.
At
school
,
during
*NL*
the
one
o'clock
lesson
,
the
sun
made
me
sick
with
impatience
and
boredom
*NL*
as
it
let
fall
a
golden
stream
that
crept
to
the
edge
of
my
desk
,
like
*NL*
an
invitation
to
the
feast
at
which
I
could
not
myself
arrive
before
*NL*
three
o'clock
,
until
the
moment
when
Françoise
came
to
fetch
me
at
the
*NL*
school-gate
,
and
we
made
our
way
towards
the
Champs-Elysées
through
*NL*
streets
decorated
with
sunlight
,
dense
with
people
,
over
which
the
*NL*
balconies
,
detached
by
the
sun
and
made
vaporous
,
seemed
to
float
in
*NL*
front
of
the
houses
like
clouds
of
gold
.
Alas
!
in
the
Champs-Elysées
*NL*
I
found
no
Gilberte
;
she
had
not
yet
arrived
.
Motionless
,
on
the
lawn
*NL*
nurtured
by
the
invisible
sun
which
,
here
and
there
,
kindled
to
a
flame
*NL*
the
point
of
a
blade
of
grass
,
while
the
pigeons
that
had
alighted
upon
*NL*
it
had
the
appearance
of
ancient
sculptures
which
the
gardener
's
pick
*NL*
had
heaved
to
the
surface
of
a
hallowed
soil
,
I
stood
with
my
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
the
horizon
,
expecting
at
every
moment
to
see
appear
the
form
of
*NL*
Gilberte
following
that
of
her
governess
,
behind
the
statue
that
*NL*
seemed
to
be
holding
out
the
child
,
which
it
had
in
its
arms
,
and
which
*NL*
glistened
in
the
stream
of
light
,
to
receive
benediction
from
the
*NL*
sun
.
The
old
lady
who
read
the
Débats
was
sitting
on
her
chair
,
in
her
*NL*
invariable
place
,
and
had
just
accosted
a
park-keeper
,
with
a
friendly
*NL*
wave
of
her
hands
towards
him
as
she
exclaimed
``
What
a
lovely
day
!
''
And
*NL*
when
the
chair-woman
came
up
to
collect
her
penny
,
with
an
infinity
of
*NL*
smirks
and
affectations
she
folded
the
ticket
away
inside
her
glove
,
*NL*
as
though
it
had
been
a
posy
of
flowers
,
for
which
she
had
sought
,
in
*NL*
gratitude
to
the
donor
,
the
most
becoming
place
upon
her
person
.
When
*NL*
she
had
found
it
,
she
performed
a
circular
movement
with
her
neck
,
*NL*
straightened
her
boa
,
and
fastened
upon
the
collector
,
as
she
shewed
*NL*
her
the
end
of
yellow
paper
that
stuck
out
over
her
bare
wrist
,
the
*NL*
bewitching
smile
with
which
a
woman
says
to
a
young
man
,
pointing
to
her
*NL*
bosom
:
``
You
see
,
I
'm
wearing
your
roses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
dragged
Françoise
,
on
the
way
towards
Gilberte
,
as
far
as
the
Arc
*NL*
de
Triomphe
;
we
did
not
meet
her
,
and
I
was
returning
towards
the
lawn
*NL*
convinced
,
now
,
that
she
was
not
coming
,
when
,
in
front
of
the
wooden
*NL*
horses
,
the
little
girl
with
the
sharp
voice
flung
herself
upon
me
:
*NL*
``
Quick
,
quick
,
Gilberte
's
been
here
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
She
's
just
*NL*
going
.
We
've
been
waiting

''
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
had
been
going
up
the
Avenue
des
Champs-Elysées
,
Gilberte
had
*NL*
arrived
by
the
Rue
Boissy-d'Anglas
,
Mademoiselle
having
taken
advantage
*NL*
of
the
fine
weather
to
go
on
some
errand
of
her
own
;
and
M.
Swann
was
*NL*
coming
to
fetch
his
daughter
.
And
so
it
was
my
fault
;
I
ought
not
to
*NL*
have
strayed
from
the
lawn
;
for
one
never
knew
for
certain
from
what
*NL*
direction
Gilberte
would
appear
,
whether
she
would
be
early
or
late
,
and
*NL*
this
perpetual
tension
succeeded
in
making
more
impressive
not
only
the
*NL*
Champs-Elysées
in
their
entirety
,
and
the
whole
span
of
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
like
a
vast
expanse
of
space
and
time
,
on
every
point
and
at
every
*NL*
moment
of
which
it
was
possible
that
the
form
of
Gilberte
might
appear
,
*NL*
but
also
that
form
itself
,
since
behind
its
appearance
I
felt
that
there
*NL*
lay
concealed
the
reason
for
which
it
had
shot
its
arrow
into
my
heart
*NL*
at
four
o'clock
instead
of
at
half-past
two
;
crowned
with
a
smart
hat
,
*NL*
for
paying
calls
,
instead
of
the
plain
cap
,
for
games
;
in
front
of
the
*NL*
Ambassadeurs
and
not
between
the
two
puppet-shows
;
I
divined
one
of
*NL*
those
occupations
in
which
I
might
not
follow
Gilberte
,
occupations
*NL*
that
forced
her
to
go
out
or
to
stay
at
home
,
I
was
in
contact
with
the
*NL*
mystery
of
her
unknown
life
.
It
was
this
mystery
,
too
,
which
troubled
*NL*
me
when
,
running
at
the
sharp-voiced
girl
's
bidding
,
so
as
to
begin
our
*NL*
game
without
more
delay
,
I
saw
Gilberte
,
so
quick
and
informal
with
*NL*
us
,
make
a
ceremonious
bow
to
the
old
lady
with
the
_
Débats
_
-LRB-
who
*NL*
acknowledged
it
with
``
What
a
lovely
sun
!
You
'd
think
there
was
a
fire
*NL*
burning
.
''
-RRB-
speaking
to
her
with
a
shy
smile
,
with
an
air
of
constraint
*NL*
which
called
to
my
mind
the
other
little
girl
that
Gilberte
must
be
when
*NL*
at
home
with
her
parents
,
or
with
friends
of
her
parents
,
paying
*NL*
visits
,
in
all
the
rest
,
that
escaped
me
,
of
her
existence
.
But
of
that
*NL*
existence
no
one
gave
me
so
strong
an
impression
as
did
M.
Swann
,
who
*NL*
came
a
little
later
to
fetch
his
daughter
.
That
was
because
he
and
Mme.
*NL*
Swann
--
inasmuch
as
their
daughter
lived
with
them
,
as
her
lessons
,
*NL*
her
games
,
her
friendships
depended
upon
them
--
contained
for
me
,
like
*NL*
Gilberte
,
perhaps
even
more
than
Gilberte
,
as
befitted
subjects
that
had
*NL*
an
all-powerful
control
over
her
in
whom
it
must
have
had
its
source
,
an
*NL*
undefined
,
an
inaccessible
quality
of
melancholy
charm
.
Everything
that
*NL*
concerned
them
was
on
my
part
the
object
of
so
constant
a
preoccupation
*NL*
that
the
days
on
which
,
as
on
this
day
,
M.
Swann
-LRB-
whom
I
had
seen
so
*NL*
often
,
long
ago
,
without
his
having
aroused
my
curiosity
,
when
he
*NL*
was
still
on
good
terms
with
my
parents
-RRB-
came
for
Gilberte
to
the
*NL*
Champs-Elysées
,
once
the
pulsations
to
which
my
heart
had
been
excited
*NL*
by
the
appearance
of
his
grey
hat
and
hooded
cape
had
subsided
,
the
*NL*
sight
of
him
still
impressed
me
as
might
that
of
an
historic
personage
,
*NL*
upon
whom
one
had
just
been
studying
a
series
of
books
,
and
the
smallest
*NL*
details
of
whose
life
one
learned
with
enthusiasm
.
His
relations
with
*NL*
the
Comte
de
Paris
,
which
,
when
I
heard
them
discussed
at
Combray
,
*NL*
seemed
to
me
unimportant
,
became
now
in
my
eyes
something
marvellous
,
*NL*
as
if
no
one
else
had
ever
known
the
House
of
Orleans
;
they
set
him
*NL*
in
vivid
detachment
against
the
vulgar
background
of
pedestrians
*NL*
of
different
classes
,
who
encumbered
that
particular
path
in
the
*NL*
Champs-Elysées
,
in
the
midst
of
whom
I
admired
his
condescending
to
*NL*
figure
without
claiming
any
special
deference
,
which
as
it
happened
none
*NL*
of
them
dreamed
of
paying
him
,
so
profound
was
the
incognito
in
which
he
*NL*
was
wrapped
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
responded
politely
to
the
salutations
of
Gilberte
's
companions
,
even
*NL*
to
mine
,
for
all
that
he
was
no
longer
on
good
terms
with
my
family
,
*NL*
but
without
appearing
to
know
who
I
was
.
-LRB-
This
reminded
me
that
he
had
*NL*
constantly
seen
me
in
the
country
;
a
memory
which
I
had
retained
,
but
*NL*
kept
out
of
sight
,
because
,
since
I
had
seen
Gilberte
again
,
Swann
had
*NL*
become
to
me
pre-eminently
her
father
,
and
no
longer
the
Combray
Swann
;
*NL*
as
the
ideas
which
,
nowadays
,
I
made
his
name
connote
were
different
*NL*
from
the
ideas
in
the
system
of
which
it
was
formerly
comprised
,
which
*NL*
I
utilised
not
at
all
now
when
I
had
occasion
to
think
of
him
,
he
had
*NL*
become
a
new
,
another
person
;
still
I
attached
him
by
an
artificial
*NL*
thread
,
secondary
and
transversal
,
to
our
former
guest
;
and
as
nothing
*NL*
had
any
longer
any
value
for
me
save
in
the
extent
to
which
my
love
*NL*
might
profit
by
it
,
it
was
with
a
spasm
of
shame
and
of
regret
at
not
*NL*
being
able
to
erase
them
from
my
memory
that
I
recaptured
the
years
in
*NL*
which
,
in
the
eyes
of
this
same
Swann
who
was
at
this
moment
before
me
*NL*
in
the
Champs-Elysées
,
and
to
whom
,
fortunately
,
Gilberte
had
perhaps
*NL*
not
mentioned
my
name
,
I
had
so
often
,
in
the
evenings
,
made
myself
*NL*
ridiculous
by
sending
to
ask
Mamma
to
come
upstairs
to
my
room
to
say
*NL*
good-night
to
me
,
while
she
was
drinking
coffee
with
him
and
my
father
*NL*
and
my
grandparents
at
the
table
in
the
garden
.
-RRB-
He
told
Gilberte
that
*NL*
she
might
play
one
game
;
he
could
wait
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
;
and
,
*NL*
sitting
down
,
just
like
anyone
else
,
on
an
iron
chair
,
paid
for
his
*NL*
ticket
with
that
hand
which
Philippe
VII
had
so
often
held
in
his
own
,
*NL*
while
we
began
our
game
upon
the
lawn
,
scattering
the
pigeons
,
whose
*NL*
beautiful
,
iridescent
bodies
-LRB-
shaped
like
hearts
and
,
surely
,
the
lilacs
*NL*
of
the
feathered
kingdom
-RRB-
took
refuge
as
in
so
many
sanctuaries
,
one
on
*NL*
the
great
basin
of
stone
,
on
which
its
beak
,
as
it
disappeared
below
the
*NL*
rim
,
conferred
the
part
,
assigned
the
purpose
of
offering
to
the
bird
in
*NL*
abundance
the
fruit
or
grain
at
which
it
appeared
to
be
pecking
,
another
*NL*
on
the
head
of
the
statue
,
which
it
seemed
to
crown
with
one
of
those
*NL*
enamelled
objects
whose
polychrome
varies
in
certain
classical
works
*NL*
the
monotony
of
the
stone
,
and
with
an
attribute
which
,
when
the
goddess
*NL*
bears
it
,
entitles
her
to
a
particular
epithet
and
makes
of
her
,
as
a
*NL*
different
Christian
name
makes
of
a
mortal
,
a
fresh
divinity
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
these
sunny
days
which
had
not
realised
my
hopes
,
I
had
not
*NL*
the
courage
to
conceal
my
disappointment
from
Gilberte
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
ever
so
many
things
to
ask
you
,
''
I
said
to
her
;
``
I
thought
that
*NL*
to-day
was
going
to
mean
so
much
in
our
friendship
.
And
no
sooner
have
*NL*
you
come
than
you
go
away
!
Try
to
come
early
to-morrow
,
so
that
I
can
*NL*
talk
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
face
lighted
up
and
she
jumped
for
joy
as
she
answered
:
``
Tomorrow
,
*NL*
you
may
make
up
your
mind
,
my
dear
friend
,
I
sha
'n'
t
come
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
of
all
I
've
a
big
luncheon-party
;
then
in
the
afternoon
I
*NL*
am
going
to
a
friend
's
house
to
see
King
Theodosius
arrive
from
her
*NL*
windows
;
wo
n't
that
be
splendid
?
--
and
then
,
next
day
,
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
_
Michel
Strogoff
_
,
and
after
that
it
will
soon
be
Christmas
,
and
the
New
*NL*
Year
holidays
!
Perhaps
they
'll
take
me
south
,
to
the
Riviera
;
wo
n't
that
*NL*
be
nice
?
Though
I
should
miss
the
Christmas-tree
here
;
anyhow
,
if
I
do
*NL*
stay
in
Paris
,
I
sha
'n'
t
be
coming
here
,
because
I
shall
be
out
paying
*NL*
calls
with
Mamma
.
Good-bye
--
there
's
Papa
calling
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
returned
home
with
Françoise
through
streets
that
were
still
gay
with
*NL*
sunshine
,
as
on
the
evening
of
a
holiday
when
the
merriment
is
over
.
I
*NL*
could
scarcely
drag
my
legs
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
surprised
;
''
said
Françoise
,
``
it
's
not
the
right
weather
for
the
*NL*
time
of
year
;
it
's
much
too
warm
.
Oh
dear
,
oh
dear
,
to
think
of
all
*NL*
the
poor
sick
people
there
must
be
everywhere
;
you
would
think
that
up
*NL*
there
,
too
,
everything
's
got
out
of
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
repeated
to
myself
,
stifling
my
sobs
,
the
words
in
which
Gilberte
had
*NL*
given
utterance
to
her
joy
at
the
prospect
of
not
coming
back
,
for
a
*NL*
long
time
,
to
the
Champs-Elysées
.
But
already
the
charm
with
which
,
by
*NL*
the
mere
act
of
thinking
,
my
mind
was
filled
as
soon
as
it
thought
of
*NL*
her
,
the
privileged
position
,
unique
even
if
it
were
painful
,
in
which
*NL*
I
was
inevitably
placed
in
relation
to
Gilberte
by
the
contraction
of
a
*NL*
scar
in
my
mind
,
had
begun
to
add
to
that
very
mark
of
her
indifference
*NL*
something
romantic
,
and
in
the
midst
of
my
tears
my
lips
would
shape
*NL*
themselves
in
a
smile
which
was
indeed
the
timid
outline
of
a
kiss
.
And
*NL*
when
the
time
came
for
the
postman
I
said
to
myself
,
that
evening
as
on
*NL*
every
other
:
``
I
am
going
to
have
a
letter
from
Gilberte
,
she
is
going
to
*NL*
tell
me
,
at
last
,
that
she
has
never
ceased
to
love
me
,
and
to
explain
*NL*
to
me
the
mysterious
reason
by
which
she
has
been
forced
to
conceal
her
*NL*
love
from
me
until
now
,
to
put
on
the
appearance
of
being
able
to
be
*NL*
happy
without
seeing
me
;
the
reason
for
which
she
has
assumed
the
form
*NL*
of
the
other
Gilberte
,
who
is
simply
a
companion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
evening
I
would
beguile
myself
into
imagining
this
letter
,
*NL*
believing
that
I
was
actually
reading
it
,
reciting
each
of
its
sentences
*NL*
in
turn
.
Suddenly
I
would
stop
,
in
alarm
.
I
had
realised
that
,
if
I
was
*NL*
to
receive
a
letter
from
Gilberte
,
it
could
not
,
in
any
case
,
be
this
*NL*
letter
,
since
it
was
I
myself
who
had
just
composed
it
.
And
from
that
*NL*
moment
I
would
strive
to
keep
my
thoughts
clear
of
the
words
which
I
*NL*
should
have
liked
her
to
write
to
me
,
from
fear
lest
,
by
first
selecting
*NL*
them
myself
,
I
should
be
excluding
just
those
identical
words
,
--
the
*NL*
dearest
,
the
most
desired
--
from
the
field
of
possible
events
.
Even
if
,
*NL*
by
an
almost
impossible
coincidence
,
it
had
been
precisely
the
letter
*NL*
of
my
invention
that
Gilberte
had
addressed
to
me
of
her
own
accord
,
*NL*
recognising
my
own
work
in
it
I
should
not
have
had
the
impression
that
*NL*
I
was
receiving
something
that
had
not
originated
in
myself
,
something
*NL*
real
,
something
new
,
a
happiness
external
to
my
mind
,
independent
of
my
*NL*
will
,
a
gift
indeed
from
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
waited
I
read
over
again
a
page
which
,
although
it
had
not
been
*NL*
written
to
me
by
Gilberte
,
came
to
me
,
none
the
less
,
from
her
,
that
*NL*
page
by
Bergotte
upon
the
beauty
of
the
old
myths
from
which
Racine
*NL*
drew
his
inspiration
,
which
-LRB-
with
the
agate
marble
-RRB-
I
always
kept
within
*NL*
reach
.
I
was
touched
by
my
friend
's
kindness
in
having
procured
the
book
*NL*
for
me
;
and
as
everyone
is
obliged
to
find
some
reason
for
his
passion
,
*NL*
so
much
so
that
he
is
glad
to
find
in
the
creature
whom
he
loves
*NL*
qualities
which
-LRB-
he
has
learned
by
reading
or
in
conversation
-RRB-
are
*NL*
worthy
to
excite
a
man
's
love
,
that
he
assimilates
them
by
imitation
*NL*
and
makes
out
of
them
fresh
reasons
for
his
love
,
even
although
these
*NL*
qualities
be
diametrically
opposed
to
those
for
which
his
love
would
*NL*
have
sought
,
so
long
as
it
was
spontaneous
--
as
Swann
,
before
my
day
,
had
*NL*
sought
to
establish
the
aesthetic
basis
of
Odette
's
beauty
--
I
,
who
had
*NL*
at
first
loved
Gilberte
,
in
Combray
days
,
on
account
of
all
the
unknown
*NL*
element
in
her
life
into
which
I
would
fain
have
plunged
headlong
,
have
*NL*
undergone
reincarnation
,
discarding
my
own
separate
existence
as
a
thing
*NL*
that
no
longer
mattered
,
I
thought
now
,
as
of
an
inestimable
advantage
,
*NL*
that
of
this
,
my
own
,
my
too
familiar
,
my
contemptible
existence
*NL*
Gilberte
might
one
day
become
the
humble
servant
,
the
kindly
,
the
*NL*
comforting
collaborator
,
who
in
the
evenings
,
helping
me
in
my
work
,
*NL*
would
collate
for
me
the
texts
of
rare
pamphlets
.
As
for
Bergotte
,
that
*NL*
infinitely
wise
,
almost
divine
old
man
,
because
of
whom
I
had
first
,
*NL*
before
I
had
even
seen
her
,
loved
Gilberte
,
now
it
was
for
Gilberte
's
*NL*
sake
,
chiefly
,
that
I
loved
him
.
With
as
much
pleasure
as
the
pages
that
*NL*
he
had
written
about
Racine
,
I
studied
the
wrapper
,
folded
under
great
*NL*
seals
of
white
wax
and
tied
with
billows
of
pink
ribbon
,
in
which
she
*NL*
had
brought
those
pages
to
me
.
I
kissed
the
agate
marble
,
which
was
*NL*
the
better
part
of
my
love
's
heart
,
the
part
that
was
not
frivolous
but
*NL*
faithful
,
and
,
for
all
that
it
was
adorned
with
the
mysterious
charm
of
*NL*
Gilberte
's
life
,
dwelt
close
beside
me
,
inhabited
my
chamber
,
shared
my
*NL*
bed
.
But
the
beauty
of
that
stone
,
and
the
beauty
also
of
those
pages
*NL*
of
Bergotte
which
I
was
glad
to
associate
with
the
idea
of
my
love
for
*NL*
Gilberte
,
as
if
,
in
the
moments
when
my
love
seemed
no
longer
to
have
*NL*
any
existence
,
they
gave
it
a
kind
of
consistency
,
were
,
I
perceived
,
*NL*
anterior
to
that
love
,
which
they
in
no
way
resembled
;
their
elements
*NL*
had
been
determined
by
the
writer
's
talent
,
or
by
geological
laws
,
*NL*
before
ever
Gilberte
had
known
me
,
nothing
in
book
or
stone
would
have
*NL*
been
different
if
Gilberte
had
not
loved
me
,
and
there
was
nothing
,
*NL*
consequently
,
that
authorised
me
to
read
in
them
a
message
of
happiness
.
*NL*
And
while
my
love
,
incessantly
waiting
for
the
morrow
to
bring
a
*NL*
confession
of
Gilberte
's
love
for
me
,
destroyed
,
unravelled
every
*NL*
evening
,
the
ill-done
work
of
the
day
,
in
some
shadowed
part
of
my
being
*NL*
was
an
unknown
weaver
who
would
not
leave
where
they
lay
the
severed
*NL*
threads
,
but
collected
and
rearranged
them
,
without
any
thought
of
*NL*
pleasing
me
,
or
of
toiling
for
my
advantage
,
in
the
different
order
*NL*
which
she
gave
to
all
her
handiwork
.
Without
any
special
interest
in
my
*NL*
love
,
not
beginning
by
deciding
that
I
was
loved
,
she
placed
,
side
by
*NL*
side
,
those
of
Gilberte
's
actions
that
had
seemed
to
me
inexplicable
and
*NL*
her
faults
which
I
had
excused
.
Then
,
one
with
another
,
they
took
on
*NL*
a
meaning
.
It
seemed
to
tell
me
,
this
new
arrangement
,
that
when
I
saw
*NL*
Gilberte
,
instead
of
coming
to
me
in
the
Champs-Elysées
,
going
to
a
*NL*
party
,
or
on
errands
with
her
governess
,
when
I
saw
her
prepared
for
*NL*
an
absence
that
would
extend
over
the
New
Year
holidays
,
I
was
wrong
in
*NL*
thinking
,
in
saying
:
``
It
is
because
she
is
frivolous
,
''
or
``
easily
lead
.
''
*NL*
For
she
would
have
ceased
to
be
either
if
she
had
loved
me
,
and
if
she
*NL*
had
been
forced
to
obey
it
would
have
been
with
the
same
despair
in
*NL*
her
heart
that
I
felt
on
the
days
when
I
did
not
see
her
.
It
shewed
me
*NL*
further
,
this
new
arrangement
,
that
I
ought
,
after
all
,
to
know
what
*NL*
it
was
to
love
,
since
I
loved
Gilberte
;
it
drew
my
attention
to
the
*NL*
constant
anxiety
that
I
had
to
`
shew
off
'
before
her
,
by
reason
of
which
*NL*
I
tried
to
persuade
my
mother
to
get
for
Françoise
a
waterproof
coat
and
*NL*
a
hat
with
a
blue
feather
,
or
,
better
still
,
to
stop
sending
with
me
to
*NL*
the
Champs-Elysées
an
attendant
with
whom
I
blushed
to
be
seen
-LRB-
to
all
*NL*
of
which
my
mother
replied
that
I
was
not
fair
to
Françoise
,
that
*NL*
she
was
an
excellent
woman
and
devoted
to
us
all
-RRB-
and
also
that
sole
,
*NL*
exclusive
need
to
see
Gilberte
,
the
result
of
which
was
that
,
months
in
*NL*
advance
,
I
could
think
of
nothing
but
how
to
find
out
at
what
date
she
*NL*
would
be
leaving
Paris
and
where
she
was
going
,
feeling
that
the
most
*NL*
attractive
country
in
the
world
would
be
but
a
place
of
exile
if
she
*NL*
were
not
to
be
there
,
and
asking
only
to
be
allowed
to
stay
for
ever
*NL*
in
Paris
,
so
long
as
I
might
see
her
in
the
Champs-Elysées
;
and
it
had
*NL*
little
difficulty
in
making
me
see
that
neither
my
anxiety
nor
my
*NL*
need
could
be
justified
by
anything
in
Gilberte
's
conduct
.
She
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
was
genuinely
fond
of
her
governess
,
without
troubling
herself
*NL*
over
what
I
might
choose
to
think
about
it
.
It
seemed
quite
natural
to
*NL*
her
not
to
come
to
the
Champs-Elysées
if
she
had
to
go
shopping
with
*NL*
Mademoiselle
,
delightful
if
she
had
to
go
out
somewhere
with
her
mother
.
*NL*
And
even
supposing
that
she
would
ever
have
allowed
me
to
spend
my
*NL*
holidays
in
the
same
place
as
herself
,
when
it
came
to
choosing
*NL*
that
place
she
considered
her
parents
'
wishes
,
a
thousand
different
*NL*
amusements
of
which
she
had
been
told
,
and
not
at
all
that
it
should
be
*NL*
the
place
to
which
my
family
were
proposing
to
send
me
.
When
she
assured
*NL*
me
-LRB-
as
sometimes
happened
-RRB-
that
she
liked
me
less
than
some
other
of
*NL*
her
friends
,
less
than
she
had
liked
me
the
day
before
,
because
by
my
*NL*
clumsiness
I
had
made
her
side
lose
a
game
,
I
would
beg
her
pardon
,
I
*NL*
would
beg
her
to
tell
me
what
I
must
do
in
order
that
she
should
begin
*NL*
again
to
like
me
as
much
as
,
or
more
than
the
rest
;
I
hoped
to
hear
her
*NL*
say
that
that
was
already
my
position
;
I
besought
her
;
as
though
she
had
*NL*
been
able
to
modify
her
affection
for
me
as
she
or
I
chose
,
to
give
me
*NL*
pleasure
,
merely
by
the
words
that
she
would
utter
,
as
my
good
or
bad
*NL*
conduct
should
deserve
.
Was
I
,
then
,
not
yet
aware
that
what
I
felt
,
*NL*
myself
,
for
her
,
depended
neither
upon
her
actions
nor
upon
my
desires
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
shewed
me
finally
,
the
new
arrangement
planned
by
my
unseen
weaver
,
*NL*
that
,
if
we
find
ourselves
hoping
that
the
actions
of
a
person
who
has
*NL*
hitherto
caused
us
anxiety
may
prove
not
to
have
been
sincere
,
they
shed
*NL*
in
their
wake
a
light
which
our
hopes
are
powerless
to
extinguish
,
a
*NL*
light
to
which
,
rather
than
to
our
hopes
,
we
must
put
the
question
,
what
*NL*
will
be
that
person
's
actions
on
the
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
new
counsels
,
my
love
listened
and
heard
them
;
they
persuaded
it
*NL*
that
the
morrow
would
not
be
different
from
all
the
days
that
had
gone
*NL*
before
;
that
Gilberte
's
feeling
for
me
,
too
long
established
now
to
*NL*
be
capable
of
alteration
,
was
indifference
;
that
in
my
friendship
with
*NL*
Gilberte
,
it
was
I
alone
who
loved
.
``
That
is
true
,
''
my
love
responded
,
*NL*
``
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
made
of
that
friendship
.
It
will
not
alter
*NL*
now
.
''
And
so
the
very
next
day
-LRB-
unless
I
were
to
wait
for
a
public
*NL*
holiday
,
if
there
was
one
approaching
,
some
anniversary
,
the
New
Year
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
one
of
those
days
which
are
not
like
other
days
,
on
which
time
*NL*
starts
afresh
,
casting
aside
the
heritage
of
the
past
,
declining
its
*NL*
legacy
of
sorrows
-RRB-
I
would
appeal
to
Gilberte
to
terminate
our
old
and
*NL*
to
join
me
in
laying
the
foundations
of
a
new
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
always
,
within
reach
,
a
plan
of
Paris
,
which
,
because
I
could
see
*NL*
drawn
on
it
the
street
in
which
M.
and
Mme.
Swann
lived
,
seemed
to
me
to
*NL*
contain
a
secret
treasure
.
And
to
please
myself
,
as
well
as
by
a
sort
*NL*
of
chivalrous
loyalty
,
in
any
connection
or
with
no
relevance
at
all
,
I
*NL*
would
repeat
the
name
of
that
street
until
my
father
,
not
being
,
like
*NL*
my
mother
and
grandmother
,
in
the
secret
of
my
love
,
would
ask
:
``
But
*NL*
why
are
you
always
talking
about
that
street
?
There
's
nothing
wonderful
*NL*
about
it
.
It
is
an
admirable
street
to
live
in
because
it
's
only
a
few
*NL*
minutes
'
walk
from
the
Bois
,
but
there
are
a
dozen
other
streets
just
*NL*
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
every
effort
to
introduce
the
name
of
Swann
into
my
conversation
*NL*
with
my
parents
;
in
my
own
mind
,
of
course
,
I
never
ceased
to
murmur
it
;
*NL*
but
I
needed
also
to
hear
its
exquisite
sound
,
and
to
make
myself
*NL*
play
that
chord
,
the
voiceless
rendering
of
which
did
not
suffice
*NL*
me
.
Moreover
,
that
name
of
Swann
,
with
which
I
had
for
so
long
been
*NL*
familiar
,
was
to
me
now
-LRB-
as
happens
at
times
to
people
suffering
from
*NL*
aphasia
,
in
the
case
of
the
most
ordinary
words
-RRB-
the
name
of
something
*NL*
new
.
It
was
for
ever
present
in
my
mind
,
which
could
not
,
however
,
grow
*NL*
accustomed
to
it
.
I
analysed
it
,
I
spelt
it
;
its
orthography
came
to
me
*NL*
as
a
surprise
.
And
with
its
familiarity
it
had
simultaneously
lost
its
*NL*
innocence
.
The
pleasure
that
I
derived
from
the
sound
of
it
I
felt
to
*NL*
be
so
guilty
,
that
it
seemed
to
me
as
though
the
others
must
read
my
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
would
change
the
conversation
if
I
endeavoured
to
guide
it
*NL*
in
that
direction
.
I
fell
back
upon
subjects
which
still
brought
me
into
*NL*
touch
with
Gilberte
,
I
eternally
repeated
the
same
words
,
and
it
was
no
*NL*
use
my
knowing
that
they
were
but
words
--
words
uttered
in
her
absence
,
*NL*
which
she
could
not
hear
,
words
without
virtue
in
themselves
,
repeating
*NL*
what
were
,
indeed
,
facts
,
but
powerless
to
modify
them
--
for
still
*NL*
it
seemed
to
me
that
by
dint
of
handling
,
of
stirring
in
this
way
*NL*
everything
that
had
reference
to
Gilberte
,
I
might
perhaps
make
emerge
*NL*
from
it
something
that
would
bring
me
happiness
.
I
told
my
parents
again
*NL*
that
Gilberte
was
very
fond
of
her
governess
,
as
if
the
statement
,
when
*NL*
repeated
for
the
hundredth
time
,
would
at
last
have
the
effect
of
making
*NL*
Gilberte
suddenly
burst
into
the
room
,
come
to
live
with
us
for
ever
.
*NL*
I
had
already
sung
the
praises
of
the
old
lady
who
read
the
_
Débats
_
*NL*
-LRB-
I
had
hinted
to
my
parents
that
she
must
at
least
be
an
Ambassador
's
*NL*
widow
,
if
not
actually
a
Highness
-RRB-
and
I
continued
to
descant
on
her
*NL*
beauty
,
her
splendour
,
her
nobility
,
until
the
day
on
which
I
mentioned
*NL*
that
,
by
what
I
had
heard
Gilberte
call
her
,
she
appeared
to
be
a
Mme.
*NL*
Blatin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
now
I
know
whom
you
mean
,
''
cried
my
mother
,
while
I
felt
myself
*NL*
grow
red
all
over
with
shame
.
``
On
guard
!
on
guard
!
--
as
your
grandfather
*NL*
says
.
And
so
it
's
she
that
you
think
so
wonderful
?
Why
,
she
's
perfectly
*NL*
horrible
,
and
always
has
been
.
She
's
the
widow
of
a
bailiff
.
You
ca
n't
*NL*
remember
,
when
you
were
little
,
all
the
trouble
I
used
to
have
to
avoid
*NL*
her
at
your
gymnastic
lessons
,
where
she
was
always
trying
to
get
hold
*NL*
of
me
--
I
did
n't
know
the
woman
,
of
course
--
to
tell
me
that
you
were
*NL*
`
much
too
nice-looking
for
a
boy
.
'
She
has
always
had
an
insane
desire
*NL*
to
get
to
know
people
,
and
she
must
be
quite
insane
,
as
I
have
always
*NL*
thought
,
if
she
really
does
know
Mme.
Swann
.
For
even
if
she
does
come
*NL*
of
very
common
people
,
I
have
never
heard
anything
said
against
her
*NL*
character
.
But
she
must
always
be
forcing
herself
upon
strangers
.
She
*NL*
is
,
really
,
a
horrible
woman
,
frightfully
vulgar
,
and
besides
,
she
is
*NL*
always
creating
awkward
situations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Swann
,
in
my
attempts
to
resemble
him
,
I
spent
the
whole
time
,
*NL*
when
I
was
at
table
,
in
drawing
my
finger
along
my
nose
and
in
rubbing
*NL*
my
eyes
.
My
father
would
exclaim
:
``
The
child
's
a
perfect
idiot
,
he
's
*NL*
becoming
quite
impossible
.
''
More
than
all
else
I
should
have
liked
to
*NL*
be
as
bald
as
Swann
.
He
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
creature
so
extraordinary
*NL*
that
I
found
it
impossible
to
believe
that
people
whom
I
knew
and
often
*NL*
saw
knew
him
also
,
and
that
in
the
course
of
the
day
anyone
might
run
*NL*
against
him
.
And
once
my
mother
,
while
she
was
telling
us
,
as
she
did
*NL*
every
evening
at
dinner
,
where
she
had
been
and
what
she
had
done
that
*NL*
afternoon
,
merely
by
the
words
:
``
By
the
way
,
guess
whom
I
saw
at
the
*NL*
Trois
Quartiers
--
at
the
umbrella
counter
--
Swann
!
''
caused
to
burst
open
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
her
narrative
-LRB-
an
arid
desert
to
me
-RRB-
a
mystic
blossom
.
*NL*
What
a
melancholy
satisfaction
to
learn
that
,
that
very
afternoon
,
*NL*
threading
through
the
crowd
his
supernatural
form
,
Swann
had
gone
to
*NL*
buy
an
umbrella
.
Among
the
events
of
the
day
,
great
and
small
,
but
*NL*
all
equally
unimportant
,
that
one
alone
aroused
in
me
those
peculiar
*NL*
vibrations
by
which
my
love
for
Gilberte
was
invariably
stirred
.
My
*NL*
father
complained
that
I
took
no
interest
in
anything
,
because
I
did
not
*NL*
listen
while
he
was
speaking
of
the
political
developments
that
might
*NL*
follow
the
visit
of
King
Theodosius
,
at
that
moment
in
France
as
*NL*
the
nation
's
guest
and
-LRB-
it
was
hinted
-RRB-
ally
.
And
yet
how
intensely
*NL*
interested
I
was
to
know
whether
Swann
had
been
wearing
his
hooded
cape
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
speak
to
him
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
of
course
I
did
,
''
answered
my
mother
,
who
always
seemed
afraid
*NL*
lest
,
were
she
to
admit
that
we
were
not
on
the
warmest
of
terms
with
*NL*
Swann
,
people
would
seek
to
reconcile
us
more
than
she
cared
for
,
in
*NL*
view
of
the
existence
of
Mme.
Swann
,
whom
she
did
not
wish
to
know
.
``
It
*NL*
was
he
who
came
up
and
spoke
to
me
.
I
had
n't
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
n't
quarrelled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quarrelled
?
What
on
earth
made
you
think
that
we
had
quarrelled
?
''
*NL*
she
briskly
parried
,
as
though
I
had
cast
doubt
on
the
fiction
of
her
*NL*
friendly
relations
with
Swann
,
and
was
planning
an
attempt
to
`
bring
*NL*
them
together
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
might
be
cross
with
you
for
never
asking
him
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
is
n't
obliged
to
ask
everyone
to
one
's
house
,
you
know
;
has
he
ever
*NL*
asked
me
to
his
?
I
do
n't
know
his
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
used
often
to
come
,
at
Combray
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
he
did
!
He
used
to
come
at
Combray
,
and
now
,
in
Paris
,
*NL*
he
has
something
better
to
do
,
and
so
have
I
.
But
I
can
promise
you
,
we
*NL*
did
n't
look
in
the
least
like
people
who
had
quarrelled
.
We
were
kept
*NL*
waiting
there
for
some
time
,
while
they
brought
him
his
parcel
.
He
*NL*
asked
after
you
;
he
told
me
you
had
been
playing
with
his
daughter
--
''
*NL*
my
mother
went
on
,
amazing
me
with
the
portentous
revelation
of
my
own
*NL*
existence
in
Swann
's
mind
;
far
more
than
that
,
of
my
existence
in
so
*NL*
complete
,
so
material
a
form
that
when
I
stood
before
him
,
trembling
*NL*
with
love
,
in
the
Champs-Elysées
,
he
had
known
my
name
,
and
who
my
*NL*
mother
was
,
and
had
been
able
to
blend
with
my
quality
as
his
daughter
's
*NL*
playmate
certain
facts
with
regard
to
my
grandparents
and
their
*NL*
connections
,
the
place
in
which
we
lived
,
certain
details
of
our
past
*NL*
life
,
all
of
which
I
myself
perhaps
did
not
know
.
But
my
mother
did
not
*NL*
seem
to
have
noticed
anything
particularly
attractive
in
that
counter
at
*NL*
the
Trois
Quartiers
where
she
had
represented
to
Swann
,
at
the
moment
*NL*
in
which
he
caught
sight
of
her
,
a
definite
person
with
whom
he
had
*NL*
sufficient
memories
in
common
to
impel
him
to
come
up
to
her
and
to
*NL*
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
either
she
or
my
father
seem
to
find
any
occasion
now
to
mention
*NL*
Swann
's
family
,
the
grandparents
of
Gilberte
,
nor
to
use
the
title
of
*NL*
stockbroker
,
topics
than
which
nothing
else
gave
me
so
keen
a
pleasure
.
*NL*
My
imagination
had
isolated
and
consecrated
in
the
social
Paris
a
*NL*
certain
family
,
just
as
it
had
set
apart
in
the
structural
Paris
a
*NL*
certain
house
,
on
whose
porch
it
had
fashioned
sculptures
and
made
its
*NL*
windows
precious
.
But
these
ornaments
I
alone
had
eyes
to
see
.
Just
as
*NL*
my
father
and
mother
looked
upon
the
house
in
which
Swann
lived
as
one
*NL*
that
closely
resembled
the
other
houses
built
at
the
same
period
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
the
Bois
,
so
Swann
's
family
seemed
to
them
to
be
in
the
*NL*
same
category
as
many
other
families
of
stockbrokers
.
Their
judgment
was
*NL*
more
or
less
favourable
according
to
the
extent
to
which
the
family
in
*NL*
question
shared
in
merits
that
were
common
to
the
rest
of
the
universe
,
*NL*
and
there
was
about
it
nothing
that
they
could
call
unique
.
What
,
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
they
did
appreciate
in
the
Swanns
they
found
in
equal
,
if
*NL*
not
in
greater
measure
elsewhere
.
And
so
,
after
admitting
that
the
house
*NL*
was
in
a
good
position
,
they
would
go
on
to
speak
of
some
other
house
*NL*
that
was
in
a
better
,
but
had
nothing
to
do
with
Gilberte
,
or
of
*NL*
financiers
on
a
larger
scale
than
her
grandfather
had
been
;
and
if
they
*NL*
had
appeared
,
for
a
moment
,
to
be
of
my
opinion
,
that
was
a
mistake
*NL*
which
was
very
soon
corrected
.
For
in
order
to
distinguish
in
all
*NL*
Gilberte
's
surroundings
an
indefinable
quality
analogous
,
in
the
scale
*NL*
of
emotions
,
to
what
in
the
scale
of
colours
is
called
infra-red
,
a
*NL*
supplementary
sense
of
perception
was
required
,
with
which
love
,
for
the
*NL*
time
being
,
had
endowed
me
;
and
this
my
parents
lacked
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
days
when
Gilberte
had
warned
me
that
she
would
not
be
coming
to
*NL*
the
Champs-Elysées
,
I
would
try
to
arrange
my
walks
so
that
I
should
*NL*
be
brought
into
some
kind
of
contact
with
her
.
Sometimes
I
would
lead
*NL*
Françoise
on
a
pilgrimage
to
the
house
in
which
the
Swanns
lived
,
making
*NL*
her
repeat
to
me
unendingly
all
that
she
had
learned
from
the
governess
*NL*
with
regard
to
Mme.
Swann
.
``
It
seems
,
she
puts
great
faith
in
medals
.
*NL*
She
would
never
think
of
starting
on
a
journey
if
she
had
heard
an
*NL*
owl
hoot
,
or
the
death-watch
in
the
wall
,
or
if
she
had
seen
a
cat
*NL*
at
midnight
,
or
if
the
furniture
had
creaked
.
Oh
yes
!
she
's
a
most
*NL*
religious
lady
,
she
is
!
''
I
was
so
madly
in
love
with
Gilberte
that
if
,
*NL*
on
our
way
,
I
caught
sight
of
their
old
butler
taking
the
dog
out
,
my
*NL*
emotion
would
bring
me
to
a
standstill
,
I
would
fasten
on
his
white
*NL*
whiskers
eyes
that
melted
with
passion
.
And
Françoise
would
rouse
me
*NL*
with
:
``
What
's
wrong
with
you
now
,
child
?
''
and
we
would
continue
on
our
*NL*
way
until
we
reached
their
gate
,
where
a
porter
,
different
from
every
*NL*
other
porter
in
the
world
,
and
saturated
,
even
to
the
braid
on
his
*NL*
livery
,
with
the
same
melancholy
charm
that
I
had
felt
to
be
latent
in
*NL*
the
name
of
Gilberte
,
looked
at
me
as
though
he
knew
that
I
was
one
*NL*
of
those
whose
natural
unworthiness
would
for
ever
prevent
them
from
*NL*
penetrating
into
the
mysteries
of
the
life
inside
,
which
it
was
his
duty
*NL*
to
guard
,
and
over
which
the
ground-floor
windows
appeared
conscious
of
*NL*
being
protectingly
closed
,
with
far
less
resemblance
,
between
the
nobly
*NL*
sweeping
arches
of
their
muslin
curtains
,
to
any
other
windows
in
the
*NL*
world
than
to
Gilberte
's
glancing
eyes
.
On
other
days
we
would
go
along
*NL*
the
boulevards
,
and
I
would
post
myself
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Duphot
;
*NL*
I
had
heard
that
Swann
was
often
to
be
seen
passing
there
,
on
his
way
*NL*
to
the
dentist
's
;
and
my
imagination
so
far
differentiated
Gilberte
's
*NL*
father
from
the
rest
of
humanity
,
his
presence
in
the
midst
of
a
crowd
*NL*
of
real
people
introduced
among
them
so
miraculous
an
element
,
that
even
*NL*
before
we
reached
the
Madeleine
I
would
be
trembling
with
emotion
at
*NL*
the
thought
that
I
was
approaching
a
street
from
which
that
supernatural
*NL*
apparition
might
at
any
moment
burst
upon
me
unawares
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
most
often
of
all
,
on
days
when
I
was
not
to
see
Gilberte
,
as
I
*NL*
had
heard
that
Mme.
Swann
walked
almost
every
day
along
the
Allée
des
*NL*
Acacias
,
round
the
big
lake
,
and
in
the
Allée
de
la
Reine
Marguerite
,
I
*NL*
would
guide
Françoise
in
the
direction
of
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
It
was
*NL*
to
me
like
one
of
those
zoological
gardens
in
which
one
sees
assembled
*NL*
together
a
variety
of
flora
,
and
contrasted
effects
in
landscape
;
where
*NL*
from
a
hill
one
passes
to
a
grotto
,
a
meadow
,
rocks
,
a
stream
,
a
trench
,
*NL*
another
hill
,
a
marsh
,
but
knows
that
they
are
there
only
to
enable
*NL*
the
hippopotamus
,
zebra
,
crocodile
,
rabbit
,
bear
and
heron
to
disport
*NL*
themselves
in
a
natural
or
a
picturesque
setting
;
this
,
the
Bois
,
*NL*
equally
complex
,
uniting
a
multitude
of
little
worlds
,
distinct
and
*NL*
separate
--
placing
a
stage
set
with
red
trees
,
American
oaks
,
like
an
*NL*
experimental
forest
in
Virginia
,
next
to
a
fir-wood
by
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
lake
,
or
to
a
forest
grove
from
which
would
suddenly
emerge
,
in
her
*NL*
lissom
covering
of
furs
,
with
the
large
,
appealing
eyes
of
a
dumb
*NL*
animal
,
a
hastening
walker
--
was
the
Garden
of
Woman
;
and
like
the
*NL*
myrtle-alley
in
the
Aeneid
,
planted
for
their
delight
with
trees
of
one
*NL*
kind
only
,
the
Allée
des
Acacias
was
thronged
by
the
famous
Beauties
*NL*
of
the
day
.
As
,
from
a
long
way
off
,
the
sight
of
the
jutting
crag
from
*NL*
which
it
dives
into
the
pool
thrills
with
joy
the
children
who
know
*NL*
that
they
are
going
to
behold
the
seal
,
long
before
I
reached
the
*NL*
acacia-alley
,
their
fragrance
,
scattered
abroad
,
would
make
me
feel
that
*NL*
I
was
approaching
the
incomparable
presence
of
a
vegetable
personality
,
*NL*
strong
and
tender
;
then
,
as
I
drew
near
,
the
sight
of
their
topmost
*NL*
branches
,
their
lightly
tossing
foliage
,
in
its
easy
grace
,
its
*NL*
coquettish
outline
,
its
delicate
fabric
,
over
which
hundreds
of
flowers
*NL*
were
laid
,
like
winged
and
throbbing
colonies
of
precious
insects
;
and
*NL*
finally
their
name
itself
,
feminine
,
indolent
and
seductive
,
made
my
*NL*
heart
beat
,
but
with
a
social
longing
,
like
those
waltzes
which
remind
*NL*
us
only
of
the
names
of
the
fair
dancers
,
called
aloud
as
they
entered
*NL*
the
ball-room
.
I
had
been
told
that
I
should
see
in
the
alley
certain
*NL*
women
of
fashion
,
who
,
in
spite
of
their
not
all
having
husbands
,
were
*NL*
constantly
mentioned
in
conjunction
with
Mme.
Swann
,
but
most
often
by
*NL*
their
professional
names
;
--
their
new
names
,
when
they
had
any
,
being
*NL*
but
a
sort
of
incognito
,
a
veil
which
those
who
would
speak
of
them
were
*NL*
careful
to
draw
aside
,
so
as
to
make
themselves
understood
.
Thinking
*NL*
that
Beauty
--
in
the
order
of
feminine
elegance
--
was
governed
by
occult
*NL*
laws
into
the
knowledge
of
which
they
had
been
initiated
,
and
that
they
*NL*
had
the
power
to
realise
it
,
I
accepted
before
seeing
them
,
like
the
*NL*
truth
of
a
coming
revelation
,
the
appearance
of
their
clothes
,
of
their
*NL*
carriages
and
horses
,
of
a
thousand
details
among
which
I
placed
my
*NL*
faith
as
in
an
inner
soul
which
gave
the
cohesion
of
a
work
of
art
to
*NL*
that
ephemeral
and
changing
pageant
.
But
it
was
Mme.
Swann
whom
I
wished
*NL*
to
see
,
and
I
waited
for
her
to
go
past
,
as
deeply
moved
as
though
*NL*
she
were
Gilberte
,
whose
parents
,
saturated
,
like
everything
in
her
*NL*
environment
,
with
her
own
special
charm
,
excited
in
me
as
keen
a
passion
*NL*
as
she
did
herself
,
indeed
a
still
more
painful
disturbance
-LRB-
since
their
*NL*
point
of
contact
with
her
was
that
intimate
,
that
internal
part
of
*NL*
her
life
which
was
hidden
from
me
-RRB-
,
and
furthermore
,
for
I
very
soon
*NL*
learned
,
as
we
shall
see
in
due
course
,
that
they
did
not
like
my
*NL*
playing
with
her
,
that
feeling
of
veneration
which
we
always
have
for
*NL*
those
who
hold
,
and
exercise
without
restraint
,
the
power
to
do
us
an
*NL*
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
assigned
the
first
place
,
in
the
order
of
aesthetic
merit
and
of
*NL*
social
grandeur
,
to
simplicity
,
when
I
saw
Mme.
Swann
on
foot
,
in
a
*NL*
`
polonaise
'
of
plain
cloth
,
a
little
toque
on
her
head
trimmed
with
a
*NL*
pheasant
's
wing
,
a
bunch
of
violets
in
her
bosom
,
hastening
along
the
*NL*
Allée
des
Acacias
as
if
it
had
been
merely
the
shortest
way
back
to
her
*NL*
own
house
,
and
acknowledging
with
a
rapid
glance
the
courtesy
of
the
*NL*
gentlemen
in
carriages
,
who
,
recognising
her
figure
at
a
distance
,
were
*NL*
raising
their
hats
to
her
and
saying
to
one
another
that
there
was
never
*NL*
anyone
so
well
turned
out
as
she
.
But
instead
of
simplicity
it
was
to
*NL*
ostentation
that
I
must
assign
the
first
place
if
,
after
I
had
compelled
*NL*
Françoise
,
who
could
hold
out
no
longer
,
and
complained
that
her
legs
*NL*
were
`
giving
'
beneath
her
,
to
stroll
up
and
down
with
me
for
another
*NL*
hour
,
I
saw
at
length
,
emerging
from
the
Porte
Dauphine
,
figuring
for
*NL*
me
a
royal
dignity
,
the
passage
of
a
sovereign
,
an
impression
such
as
*NL*
no
real
Queen
has
ever
since
been
able
to
give
me
,
because
my
notion
of
*NL*
their
power
has
been
less
vague
,
and
more
founded
upon
experience
--
borne
*NL*
along
by
the
flight
of
a
pair
of
fiery
horses
,
slender
and
shapely
as
*NL*
one
sees
them
in
the
drawings
of
Constantin
Guys
,
carrying
on
its
box
an
*NL*
enormous
coachman
,
furred
like
a
cossack
,
and
by
his
side
a
diminutive
*NL*
groom
,
like
Toby
,
``
the
late
Beaudenord
's
tiger
,
''
I
saw
--
or
rather
I
*NL*
felt
its
outlines
engraved
upon
my
heart
by
a
clean
and
killing
stab
--
a
*NL*
matchless
victoria
,
built
rather
high
,
and
hinting
,
through
the
extreme
*NL*
modernity
of
its
appointments
,
at
the
forms
of
an
earlier
day
,
deep
down
*NL*
in
which
lay
negligently
back
Mme.
Swann
,
her
hair
,
now
quite
pale
with
*NL*
one
grey
lock
,
girt
with
a
narrow
band
of
flowers
,
usually
violets
,
from
*NL*
which
floated
down
long
veils
,
a
lilac
parasol
in
her
hand
,
on
her
lips
*NL*
an
ambiguous
smile
in
which
I
read
only
the
benign
condescension
*NL*
of
Majesty
,
though
it
was
pre-eminently
the
enticing
smile
of
the
*NL*
courtesan
,
which
she
graciously
bestowed
upon
the
men
who
bowed
to
her
.
*NL*
That
smile
was
,
in
reality
,
saying
to
one
:
``
Oh
yes
,
I
do
remember
,
quite
*NL*
well
;
it
was
wonderful
!
''
to
another
:
``
How
I
should
have
loved
to
!
We
*NL*
were
unfortunate
!
''
,
to
a
third
:
``
Yes
,
if
you
like
!
I
must
just
keep
in
*NL*
the
line
for
a
minute
,
then
as
soon
as
I
can
I
will
break
away
.
''
When
*NL*
strangers
passed
she
still
allowed
to
linger
about
her
lips
a
lazy
*NL*
smile
,
as
though
she
expected
or
remembered
some
friend
,
which
made
them
*NL*
say
:
``
What
a
lovely
woman
!
''
.
And
for
certain
men
only
she
had
a
sour
,
*NL*
strained
,
shy
,
cold
smile
which
meant
:
``
Yes
,
you
old
goat
,
I
know
*NL*
that
you
've
got
a
tongue
like
a
viper
,
that
you
ca
n't
keep
quiet
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
But
do
you
suppose
that
I
care
what
you
say
?
''
Coquelin
passed
,
*NL*
talking
,
in
a
group
of
listening
friends
,
and
with
a
sweeping
wave
of
*NL*
his
hand
bade
a
theatrical
good
day
to
the
people
in
the
carriages
.
But
*NL*
I
thought
only
of
Mme.
Swann
,
and
pretended
to
have
not
yet
seen
her
,
*NL*
for
I
knew
that
,
when
she
reached
the
pigeon-shooting
ground
,
she
would
*NL*
tell
her
coachman
to
`
break
away
'
and
to
stop
the
carriage
,
so
that
she
*NL*
might
come
back
on
foot
.
And
on
days
when
I
felt
that
I
had
the
courage
*NL*
to
pass
close
by
her
I
would
drag
Françoise
off
in
that
direction
;
until
*NL*
the
moment
came
when
I
saw
Mme.
Swann
,
letting
trail
behind
her
the
long
*NL*
train
of
her
lilac
skirt
,
dressed
,
as
the
populace
imagine
queens
to
be
*NL*
dressed
,
in
rich
attire
such
as
no
other
woman
might
wear
,
lowering
*NL*
her
eyes
now
and
then
to
study
the
handle
of
her
parasol
,
paying
scant
*NL*
attention
to
the
passers-by
,
as
though
the
important
thing
for
her
,
her
*NL*
one
object
in
being
there
,
was
to
take
exercise
,
without
thinking
that
*NL*
she
was
seen
,
and
that
every
head
was
turned
towards
her
.
Sometimes
,
*NL*
however
,
when
she
had
looked
back
to
call
her
dog
to
her
,
she
would
*NL*
cast
,
almost
imperceptibly
,
a
sweeping
glance
round
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
even
who
did
not
know
her
were
warned
by
something
exceptional
,
*NL*
something
beyond
the
normal
in
her
--
or
perhaps
by
a
telepathic
*NL*
suggestion
such
as
would
move
an
ignorant
audience
to
a
frenzy
of
*NL*
applause
when
Berma
was
`
sublime
'
--
that
she
must
be
some
one
well-known
.
*NL*
They
would
ask
one
another
,
``
Who
is
she
?
''
,
or
sometimes
would
*NL*
interrogate
a
passing
stranger
,
or
would
make
a
mental
note
of
how
she
*NL*
was
dressed
so
as
to
fix
her
identity
,
later
,
in
the
mind
of
a
friend
*NL*
better
informed
than
themselves
,
who
would
at
once
enlighten
them
.
*NL*
Another
pair
,
half-stopping
in
their
walk
,
would
exchange
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
who
that
is
?
Mme.
Swann
!
That
conveys
nothing
to
you
?
Odette
*NL*
de
Crécy
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Odette
de
Crécy
!
Why
,
I
thought
as
much
.
Those
great
,
sad
eyes
...
But
I
*NL*
say
,
you
know
,
she
ca
n't
be
as
young
as
she
was
once
,
eh
?
I
remember
,
I
*NL*
had
her
on
the
day
that
MacMahon
went
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
n't
remind
her
of
it
,
if
I
were
you
.
She
is
now
Mme.
Swann
,
the
*NL*
wife
of
a
gentleman
in
the
Jockey
Club
,
a
friend
of
the
Prince
of
Wales
.
*NL*
Apart
from
that
,
though
,
she
is
wonderful
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
but
you
ought
to
have
known
her
then
;
Gad
,
she
was
lovely
!
*NL*
She
lived
in
a
very
odd
little
house
with
a
lot
of
Chinese
stuff
.
*NL*
I
remember
,
we
were
bothered
all
the
time
by
the
newsboys
,
shouting
*NL*
outside
;
in
the
end
she
made
me
get
up
and
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
listening
to
these
memories
,
I
could
feel
all
about
her
the
*NL*
indistinct
murmur
of
fame
.
My
heart
leaped
with
impatience
when
I
*NL*
thought
that
a
few
seconds
must
still
elapse
before
all
these
people
,
*NL*
among
whom
I
was
dismayed
not
to
find
a
certain
mulatto
banker
who
-LRB-
or
*NL*
so
I
felt
-RRB-
had
a
contempt
for
me
,
were
to
see
the
unknown
youth
,
to
*NL*
whom
they
had
not
,
so
far
,
been
paying
the
slightest
attention
,
salute
*NL*
-LRB-
without
knowing
her
,
it
was
true
,
but
I
thought
that
I
had
sufficient
*NL*
authority
since
my
parents
knew
her
husband
and
I
was
her
daughter
's
*NL*
playmate
-RRB-
this
woman
whose
reputation
for
beauty
,
for
misconduct
,
and
*NL*
for
elegance
was
universal
.
But
I
was
now
close
to
Mme.
Swann
;
I
pulled
*NL*
off
my
hat
with
so
lavish
,
so
prolonged
a
gesture
that
she
could
not
*NL*
repress
a
smile
.
People
laughed
.
As
for
her
,
she
had
never
seen
me
with
*NL*
Gilberte
,
she
did
not
know
my
name
,
but
I
was
for
her
--
like
one
of
the
*NL*
keepers
in
the
Bois
,
like
the
boatman
,
or
the
ducks
on
the
lake
,
to
*NL*
which
she
threw
scraps
of
bread
--
one
of
the
minor
personages
,
familiar
,
*NL*
nameless
,
as
devoid
of
individual
character
as
a
stage-hand
in
a
*NL*
theatre
,
of
her
daily
walks
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
certain
days
when
I
had
missed
her
in
the
Allée
des
Acacias
I
would
*NL*
be
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
her
in
the
Allée
de
la
Reine
Marguerite
,
*NL*
where
women
went
who
wished
to
be
alone
,
or
to
appear
to
be
wishing
to
*NL*
be
alone
;
she
would
not
be
alone
for
long
,
being
soon
overtaken
by
some
*NL*
man
or
other
,
often
in
a
grey
'til
e
'
hat
,
whom
I
did
not
know
,
and
*NL*
who
would
talk
to
her
for
some
time
,
while
their
two
carriages
crawled
*NL*
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
That
sense
of
the
complexity
of
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
which
made
it
an
*NL*
artificial
place
and
,
in
the
zoological
or
mythological
sense
of
the
*NL*
word
,
a
Garden
,
I
captured
again
,
this
year
,
as
I
crossed
it
on
my
way
*NL*
to
Trianon
,
on
one
of
those
mornings
,
early
in
November
,
when
in
Paris
,
*NL*
if
we
stay
indoors
,
being
so
near
and
yet
prevented
from
witnessing
the
*NL*
transformation
scene
of
autumn
,
which
is
drawing
so
rapidly
to
a
close
*NL*
without
our
assistance
,
we
feel
a
regret
for
the
fallen
leaves
that
*NL*
becomes
a
fever
,
and
may
even
keep
us
awake
at
night
.
Into
my
closed
*NL*
room
they
had
been
drifting
already
for
a
month
,
summoned
there
by
*NL*
my
desire
to
see
them
,
slipping
between
my
thoughts
and
the
object
,
*NL*
whatever
it
might
be
,
upon
which
I
was
trying
to
concentrate
them
,
*NL*
whirling
in
front
of
me
like
those
brown
spots
that
sometimes
,
whatever
*NL*
we
may
be
looking
at
,
will
seem
to
be
dancing
or
swimming
before
our
*NL*
eyes
.
And
on
that
morning
,
not
hearing
the
splash
of
the
rain
as
on
the
*NL*
previous
days
,
seeing
the
smile
of
fine
weather
at
the
corners
of
my
*NL*
drawn
curtains
,
as
from
the
corners
of
closed
lips
may
escape
the
secret
*NL*
of
their
happiness
,
I
had
felt
that
I
could
actually
see
those
yellow
*NL*
leaves
,
with
the
light
shining
through
them
,
in
their
supreme
beauty
;
*NL*
and
being
no
more
able
to
restrain
myself
from
going
to
look
at
the
*NL*
trees
than
,
in
my
childhood
's
days
,
when
the
wind
howled
in
the
chimney
,
*NL*
I
had
been
able
to
resist
the
longing
to
visit
the
sea
,
I
had
risen
and
*NL*
left
the
house
to
go
to
Trianon
,
passing
through
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
.
*NL*
It
was
the
hour
and
the
season
in
which
the
Bois
seems
,
perhaps
,
most
*NL*
multiform
,
not
only
because
it
is
then
most
divided
,
but
because
it
*NL*
is
divided
in
a
different
way
.
Even
in
the
unwooded
parts
,
where
the
*NL*
horizon
is
large
,
here
and
there
against
the
background
of
a
dark
*NL*
and
distant
mass
of
trees
,
now
leafless
or
still
keeping
their
summer
*NL*
foliage
unchanged
,
a
double
row
of
orange-red
chestnuts
seemed
,
as
in
a
*NL*
picture
just
begun
,
to
be
the
only
thing
painted
,
so
far
,
by
an
artist
*NL*
who
had
not
yet
laid
any
colour
on
the
rest
,
and
to
be
offering
their
*NL*
cloister
,
in
full
daylight
,
for
the
casual
exercise
of
the
human
figures
*NL*
that
would
be
added
to
the
picture
later
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farther
off
,
at
a
place
where
the
trees
were
still
all
green
,
one
alone
,
*NL*
small
,
stunted
,
lopped
,
but
stubborn
in
its
resistance
,
was
tossing
*NL*
in
the
breeze
an
ugly
mane
of
red
.
Elsewhere
,
again
,
might
be
seen
*NL*
the
first
awakening
of
this
Maytime
of
the
leaves
,
and
those
of
an
*NL*
ampelopsis
,
a
smiling
miracle
,
like
a
red
hawthorn
flowering
in
winter
,
*NL*
had
that
very
morning
all
`
come
out
,
'
so
to
speak
,
in
blossom
.
And
the
*NL*
Bois
had
the
temporary
,
unfinished
,
artificial
look
of
a
nursery
garden
*NL*
or
a
park
in
which
,
either
for
some
botanic
purpose
or
in
preparation
*NL*
for
a
festival
,
there
have
been
embedded
among
the
trees
of
commoner
*NL*
growth
,
which
have
not
yet
been
uprooted
and
transplanted
elsewhere
,
a
*NL*
few
rare
specimens
,
with
fantastic
foliage
,
which
seem
to
be
clearing
*NL*
all
round
themselves
an
empty
space
,
making
room
,
giving
air
,
diffusing
*NL*
light
.
Thus
it
was
the
time
of
year
at
which
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
*NL*
displays
more
separate
characteristics
,
assembles
more
distinct
elements
*NL*
in
a
composite
whole
than
at
any
other
.
It
was
also
the
time
of
day
.
*NL*
In
places
where
the
trees
still
kept
their
leaves
,
they
seemed
to
have
*NL*
undergone
an
alteration
of
their
substance
from
the
point
at
which
they
*NL*
were
touched
by
the
sun
's
light
,
still
,
at
this
hour
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
almost
horizontal
,
as
it
would
be
again
,
a
few
hours
later
,
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
,
just
as
dusk
began
,
it
would
flame
up
like
a
lamp
,
project
*NL*
afar
over
the
leaves
a
warm
and
artificial
glow
,
and
set
ablaze
the
few
*NL*
topmost
boughs
of
a
tree
that
would
itself
remain
unchanged
,
a
sombre
*NL*
incombustible
candelabrum
beneath
its
flaming
crest
.
At
one
spot
the
*NL*
light
grew
solid
as
a
brick
wall
,
and
like
a
piece
of
yellow
Persian
*NL*
masonry
,
patterned
in
blue
,
daubed
coarsely
upon
the
sky
the
leaves
of
*NL*
the
chestnuts
;
at
another
,
it
cut
them
off
from
the
sky
towards
which
*NL*
they
stretched
out
their
curling
,
golden
fingers
.
Half-way
up
the
trunk
*NL*
of
a
tree
draped
with
wild
vine
,
the
light
had
grafted
and
brought
to
*NL*
blossom
,
too
dazzling
to
be
clearly
distinguished
,
an
enormous
posy
,
*NL*
of
red
flowers
apparently
,
perhaps
of
a
new
variety
of
carnation
.
The
*NL*
different
parts
of
the
Bois
,
so
easily
confounded
in
summer
in
the
*NL*
density
and
monotony
of
their
universal
green
,
were
now
clearly
divided
.
*NL*
A
patch
of
brightness
indicated
the
approach
to
almost
every
one
of
*NL*
them
,
or
else
a
splendid
mass
of
foliage
stood
out
before
it
like
an
*NL*
oriflamme
.
I
could
make
out
,
as
on
a
coloured
map
,
Armenonville
,
the
*NL*
Pré
Catalan
,
Madrid
,
the
Race
Course
and
the
shore
of
the
lake
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
would
appear
some
meaningless
erection
,
a
sham
grotto
,
a
mill
,
for
*NL*
which
the
trees
made
room
by
drawing
away
from
it
,
or
which
was
borne
*NL*
upon
the
soft
green
platform
of
a
grassy
lawn
.
I
could
feel
that
the
*NL*
Bois
was
not
really
a
wood
,
that
it
existed
for
a
purpose
alien
to
the
*NL*
life
of
its
trees
;
my
sense
of
exaltation
was
due
not
only
to
admiration
*NL*
of
the
autumn
tints
but
to
a
bodily
desire
.
Ample
source
of
a
joy
which
*NL*
the
heart
feels
at
first
without
being
conscious
of
its
cause
,
without
*NL*
understanding
that
it
results
from
no
external
impulse
!
Thus
I
gazed
*NL*
at
the
trees
with
an
unsatisfied
longing
which
went
beyond
them
and
,
*NL*
without
my
knowledge
,
directed
itself
towards
that
masterpiece
of
*NL*
beautiful
strolling
women
which
the
trees
enframed
for
a
few
hours
every
*NL*
day
.
I
walked
towards
the
Allée
des
Acacias
.
I
passed
through
forest
*NL*
groves
in
which
the
morning
light
,
breaking
them
into
new
sections
,
*NL*
lopped
and
trimmed
the
trees
,
united
different
trunks
in
marriage
,
made
*NL*
nosegays
of
their
branches
.
It
would
skilfully
draw
towards
it
a
pair
of
*NL*
trees
;
making
deft
use
of
the
sharp
chisel
of
light
and
shade
,
it
would
*NL*
cut
away
from
each
of
them
half
of
its
trunk
and
branches
,
and
,
weaving
*NL*
together
the
two
halves
that
remained
,
would
make
of
them
either
a
*NL*
single
pillar
of
shade
,
defined
by
the
surrounding
light
,
or
a
single
*NL*
luminous
phantom
whose
artificial
,
quivering
contour
was
encompassed
*NL*
in
a
network
of
inky
shadows
.
When
a
ray
of
sunshine
gilded
the
highest
*NL*
branches
,
they
seemed
,
soaked
and
still
dripping
with
a
sparkling
*NL*
moisture
,
to
have
emerged
alone
from
the
liquid
,
emerald-green
*NL*
atmosphere
in
which
the
whole
grove
was
plunged
as
though
beneath
the
*NL*
sea
.
For
the
trees
continued
to
live
by
their
own
vitality
,
and
when
*NL*
they
had
no
longer
any
leaves
,
that
vitality
gleamed
more
brightly
still
*NL*
from
the
nap
of
green
velvet
that
carpeted
their
trunks
,
or
in
the
white
*NL*
enamel
of
the
globes
of
mistletoe
that
were
scattered
all
the
way
up
to
*NL*
the
topmost
branches
of
the
poplars
,
rounded
as
are
the
sun
and
moon
in
*NL*
Michelangelo
's
`
Creation
.
'
But
,
forced
for
so
many
years
now
,
by
a
sort
*NL*
of
grafting
process
,
to
share
the
life
of
feminine
humanity
,
they
called
*NL*
to
my
mind
the
figure
of
the
dryad
,
the
fair
worldling
,
swiftly
walking
,
*NL*
brightly
coloured
,
whom
they
sheltered
with
their
branches
as
she
*NL*
passed
beneath
them
,
and
obliged
to
acknowledge
,
as
they
themselves
*NL*
acknowledged
,
the
power
of
the
season
;
they
recalled
to
me
the
happy
*NL*
days
when
I
was
young
and
had
faith
,
when
I
would
hasten
eagerly
to
the
*NL*
spots
where
masterpieces
of
female
elegance
would
be
incarnate
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
beneath
the
unconscious
,
accommodating
boughs
.
But
the
beauty
*NL*
for
which
the
firs
and
acacias
of
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
made
me
long
,
*NL*
more
disquieting
in
that
respect
than
the
chestnuts
and
lilacs
of
*NL*
Trianon
which
I
was
going
to
see
,
was
not
fixed
somewhere
outside
myself
*NL*
in
the
relics
of
an
historical
period
,
in
works
of
art
,
in
a
little
*NL*
temple
of
love
at
whose
door
was
piled
an
oblation
of
autumn
leaves
*NL*
ribbed
with
gold
.
I
reached
the
shore
of
the
lake
;
I
walked
on
as
far
as
*NL*
the
pigeon-shooting
ground
.
The
idea
of
perfection
which
I
had
within
me
*NL*
I
had
bestowed
,
in
that
other
time
,
upon
the
height
of
a
victoria
,
upon
*NL*
the
raking
thinness
of
those
horses
,
frenzied
and
light
as
wasps
upon
*NL*
the
wing
,
with
bloodshot
eyes
like
the
cruel
steeds
of
Diomed
,
which
*NL*
now
,
smitten
by
a
desire
to
see
again
what
I
had
once
loved
,
as
ardent
*NL*
as
the
desire
that
had
driven
me
,
many
years
before
,
along
the
same
*NL*
paths
,
I
wished
to
see
renewed
before
my
eyes
at
the
moment
when
Mme.
*NL*
Swann
's
enormous
coachman
,
supervised
by
a
groom
no
bigger
than
his
*NL*
fist
,
and
as
infantile
as
Saint
George
in
the
picture
,
endeavoured
to
*NL*
curb
the
ardour
of
the
flying
,
steel-tipped
pinions
with
which
they
*NL*
thundered
along
the
ground
.
Alas
!
there
was
nothing
now
but
motor-cars
*NL*
driven
each
by
a
moustached
mechanic
,
with
a
tall
footman
towering
by
*NL*
his
side
.
I
wished
to
hold
before
my
bodily
eyes
,
that
I
might
know
*NL*
whether
they
were
indeed
as
charming
as
they
appeared
to
the
eyes
of
*NL*
memory
,
little
hats
,
so
low-crowned
as
to
seem
no
more
than
garlands
*NL*
about
the
brows
of
women
.
All
the
hats
now
were
immense
;
covered
with
*NL*
fruits
and
flowers
and
all
manner
of
birds
.
In
place
of
the
lovely
gowns
*NL*
in
which
Mme.
Swann
walked
like
a
Queen
,
appeared
Greco-Saxon
tunics
,
*NL*
with
Tanagra
folds
,
or
sometimes
,
in
the
Directoire
style
,
`
Liberty
*NL*
chiffons
'
sprinkled
with
flowers
like
sheets
of
wallpaper
.
On
the
heads
*NL*
of
the
gentlemen
who
might
have
been
eligible
to
stroll
with
Mme.
Swann
*NL*
in
the
Allée
de
la
Reine
Marguerite
,
I
found
not
the
grey
'til
e
'
hats
*NL*
of
old
,
nor
any
other
kind
.
They
walked
the
Bois
bare-headed
.
And
seeing
*NL*
all
these
new
elements
of
the
spectacle
,
I
had
no
longer
the
faith
*NL*
which
,
applied
to
them
,
would
have
given
them
consistency
,
unity
,
*NL*
life
;
they
passed
in
a
scattered
sequence
before
me
,
at
random
,
without
*NL*
reality
,
containing
in
themselves
no
beauty
that
my
eyes
might
have
*NL*
endeavoured
as
in
the
old
days
,
to
extract
from
them
and
to
compose
in
*NL*
a
picture
.
They
were
just
women
,
in
whose
elegance
I
had
no
belief
,
*NL*
and
whose
clothes
seemed
to
me
unimportant
.
But
when
a
belief
vanishes
,
*NL*
there
survives
it
--
more
and
more
ardently
,
so
as
to
cloak
the
absence
*NL*
of
the
power
,
now
lost
to
us
,
of
imparting
reality
to
new
phenomena
--
an
*NL*
idolatrous
attachment
to
the
old
things
which
our
belief
in
them
did
*NL*
once
animate
,
as
if
it
was
in
that
belief
and
not
in
ourselves
that
the
*NL*
divine
spark
resided
,
and
as
if
our
present
incredulity
had
a
contingent
*NL*
cause
--
the
death
of
the
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
horrible
!
''
I
exclaimed
to
myself
:
``
Does
anyone
really
imagine
that
*NL*
these
motor-cars
are
as
smart
as
the
old
carriage-and-pair
?
I
dare
say
.
*NL*
I
am
too
old
now
--
but
I
was
not
intended
for
a
world
in
which
women
*NL*
shackle
themselves
in
garments
that
are
not
even
made
of
cloth
.
To
what
*NL*
purpose
shall
I
walk
among
these
trees
if
there
is
nothing
left
now
of
*NL*
the
assembly
that
used
to
meet
beneath
the
delicate
tracery
of
reddening
*NL*
leaves
,
if
vulgarity
and
fatuity
have
supplanted
the
exquisite
thing
*NL*
that
once
their
branches
framed
?
Oh
,
horrible
!
My
consolation
is
to
*NL*
think
of
the
women
whom
I
have
known
,
in
the
past
,
now
that
there
is
*NL*
no
standard
left
of
elegance
.
But
how
can
the
people
who
watch
these
*NL*
dreadful
creatures
hobble
by
,
beneath
hats
on
which
have
been
heaped
*NL*
the
spoils
of
aviary
or
garden-bed
,
--
how
can
they
imagine
the
charm
that
*NL*
there
was
in
the
sight
of
Mme.
Swann
,
crowned
with
a
close-fitting
lilac
*NL*
bonnet
,
or
with
a
tiny
hat
from
which
rose
stiffly
above
her
head
a
*NL*
single
iris
?
''
Could
I
ever
have
made
them
understand
the
emotion
that
*NL*
I
used
to
feel
on
winter
mornings
,
when
I
met
Mme.
Swann
on
foot
,
in
an
*NL*
otter-skin
coat
,
with
a
woollen
cap
from
which
stuck
out
two
blade-like
*NL*
partridge-feathers
,
but
enveloped
also
in
the
deliberate
,
artificial
*NL*
warmth
of
her
own
house
,
which
was
suggested
by
nothing
more
than
the
*NL*
bunch
of
violets
crushed
into
her
bosom
,
whose
flowering
,
vivid
and
blue
*NL*
against
the
grey
sky
,
the
freezing
air
,
the
naked
boughs
,
had
the
same
*NL*
charming
effect
of
using
the
season
and
the
weather
merely
as
a
setting
,
*NL*
and
of
living
actually
in
a
human
atmosphere
,
in
the
atmosphere
of
this
*NL*
woman
,
as
had
in
the
vases
and
beaupots
of
her
drawing-room
,
beside
the
*NL*
blazing
fire
,
in
front
of
the
silk-covered
sofa
,
the
flowers
that
looked
*NL*
out
through
closed
windows
at
the
falling
snow
?
But
it
would
not
have
*NL*
sufficed
me
that
the
costumes
alone
should
still
have
been
the
same
as
*NL*
in
those
distant
years
.
Because
of
the
solidarity
that
binds
together
*NL*
the
different
parts
of
a
general
impression
,
parts
that
our
memory
keeps
*NL*
in
a
balanced
whole
,
of
which
we
are
not
permitted
to
subtract
or
to
*NL*
decline
any
fraction
,
I
should
have
liked
to
be
able
to
pass
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
day
with
one
of
those
women
,
over
a
cup
of
tea
,
in
a
little
house
*NL*
with
dark-painted
walls
-LRB-
as
Mme.
Swann
's
were
still
in
the
year
after
*NL*
that
in
which
the
first
part
of
this
story
ends
-RRB-
against
which
would
*NL*
glow
the
orange
flame
,
the
red
combustion
,
the
pink
and
white
flickering
*NL*
of
her
chrysanthemums
in
the
twilight
of
a
November
evening
,
in
moments
*NL*
similar
to
those
in
which
-LRB-
as
we
shall
see
-RRB-
I
had
not
managed
to
*NL*
discover
the
pleasures
for
which
I
longed
.
But
now
,
albeit
they
had
led
*NL*
to
nothing
,
those
moments
struck
me
as
having
been
charming
enough
in
*NL*
themselves
.
I
sought
to
find
them
again
as
I
remembered
them
.
Alas
!
*NL*
there
was
nothing
now
but
flats
decorated
in
the
Louis
XVI
style
,
all
*NL*
white
paint
,
with
hortensias
in
blue
enamel
.
Moreover
,
people
did
not
*NL*
return
to
Paris
,
now
,
until
much
later
.
Mme.
Swann
would
have
written
to
*NL*
me
,
from
a
country
house
,
that
she
would
not
be
in
town
before
February
,
*NL*
had
I
asked
her
to
reconstruct
for
me
the
elements
of
that
memory
which
*NL*
I
felt
to
belong
to
a
distant
era
,
to
a
date
in
time
towards
which
it
*NL*
was
forbidden
me
to
ascend
again
the
fatal
slope
,
the
elements
of
that
*NL*
longing
which
had
become
,
itself
,
as
inaccessible
as
the
pleasure
that
*NL*
it
had
once
vainly
pursued
.
And
I
should
have
required
also
that
they
*NL*
be
the
same
women
,
those
whose
costume
interested
me
because
,
at
a
time
*NL*
when
I
still
had
faith
,
my
imagination
had
individualised
them
and
had
*NL*
provided
each
of
them
with
a
legend
.
Alas
!
in
the
acacia-avenue
--
the
*NL*
myrtle-alley
--
I
did
see
some
of
them
again
,
grown
old
,
no
more
now
*NL*
than
grim
spectres
of
what
once
they
had
been
,
wandering
to
and
fro
,
in
*NL*
desperate
search
of
heaven
knew
what
,
through
the
Virgilian
groves
.
They
*NL*
had
long
fled
,
and
still
I
stood
vainly
questioning
the
deserted
paths
.
*NL*
The
sun
's
face
was
hidden
.
Nature
began
again
to
reign
over
the
Bois
,
*NL*
from
which
had
vanished
all
trace
of
the
idea
that
it
was
the
Elysian
*NL*
Garden
of
Woman
;
above
the
gimcrack
windmill
the
real
sky
was
grey
;
the
*NL*
wind
wrinkled
the
surface
of
the
Grand
Lac
in
little
wavelets
,
like
*NL*
a
real
lake
;
large
birds
passed
swiftly
over
the
Bois
,
as
over
a
real
*NL*
wood
,
and
with
shrill
cries
perched
,
one
after
another
,
on
the
great
*NL*
oaks
which
,
beneath
their
Druidical
crown
,
and
with
Dodonaic
majesty
,
*NL*
seemed
to
proclaim
the
unpeopled
vacancy
of
this
estranged
forest
,
and
*NL*
helped
me
to
understand
how
paradoxical
it
is
to
seek
in
reality
for
the
*NL*
pictures
that
are
stored
in
one
's
memory
,
which
must
inevitably
lose
*NL*
the
charm
that
comes
to
them
from
memory
itself
and
from
their
not
*NL*
being
apprehended
by
the
senses
.
The
reality
that
I
had
known
no
longer
*NL*
existed
.
It
sufficed
that
Mme.
Swann
did
not
appear
,
in
the
same
attire
*NL*
and
at
the
same
moment
,
for
the
whole
avenue
to
be
altered
.
The
places
*NL*
that
we
have
known
belong
now
only
to
the
little
world
of
space
on
which
*NL*
we
map
them
for
our
own
convenience
.
None
of
them
was
ever
more
than
a
*NL*
thin
slice
,
held
between
the
contiguous
impressions
that
composed
our
*NL*
life
at
that
time
;
remembrance
of
a
particular
form
is
but
regret
for
a
*NL*
particular
moment
;
and
houses
,
roads
,
avenues
are
as
fugitive
,
alas
,
as
*NL*
the
years
.
