CHAPTER
I.
Looking-Glass
house
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
was
certain
,
that
the
WHITE
kitten
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
it
:
--
it
was
the
black
kitten
's
fault
entirely
.
For
the
white
kitten
had
*NL*
been
having
its
face
washed
by
the
old
cat
for
the
last
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
-LRB-
and
bearing
it
pretty
well
,
considering
-RRB-
;
so
you
see
that
it
*NL*
COULD
N'T
have
had
any
hand
in
the
mischief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
Dinah
washed
her
children
's
faces
was
this
:
first
she
held
the
*NL*
poor
thing
down
by
its
ear
with
one
paw
,
and
then
with
the
other
paw
she
*NL*
rubbed
its
face
all
over
,
the
wrong
way
,
beginning
at
the
nose
:
and
*NL*
just
now
,
as
I
said
,
she
was
hard
at
work
on
the
white
kitten
,
which
was
*NL*
lying
quite
still
and
trying
to
purr
--
no
doubt
feeling
that
it
was
all
*NL*
meant
for
its
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
black
kitten
had
been
finished
with
earlier
in
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
and
so
,
while
Alice
was
sitting
curled
up
in
a
corner
of
the
great
*NL*
arm-chair
,
half
talking
to
herself
and
half
asleep
,
the
kitten
had
been
*NL*
having
a
grand
game
of
romps
with
the
ball
of
worsted
Alice
had
been
*NL*
trying
to
wind
up
,
and
had
been
rolling
it
up
and
down
till
it
had
all
*NL*
come
undone
again
;
and
there
it
was
,
spread
over
the
hearth-rug
,
all
*NL*
knots
and
tangles
,
with
the
kitten
running
after
its
own
tail
in
the
*NL*
middle
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
you
wicked
little
thing
!
'
cried
Alice
,
catching
up
the
kitten
,
and
*NL*
giving
it
a
little
kiss
to
make
it
understand
that
it
was
in
disgrace
.
*NL*
`
Really
,
Dinah
ought
to
have
taught
you
better
manners
!
You
OUGHT
,
*NL*
Dinah
,
you
know
you
ought
!
'
she
added
,
looking
reproachfully
at
the
old
*NL*
cat
,
and
speaking
in
as
cross
a
voice
as
she
could
manage
--
and
then
she
*NL*
scrambled
back
into
the
arm-chair
,
taking
the
kitten
and
the
worsted
*NL*
with
her
,
and
began
winding
up
the
ball
again
.
But
she
did
n't
get
on
*NL*
very
fast
,
as
she
was
talking
all
the
time
,
sometimes
to
the
kitten
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
to
herself
.
Kitty
sat
very
demurely
on
her
knee
,
pretending
to
*NL*
watch
the
progress
of
the
winding
,
and
now
and
then
putting
out
one
*NL*
paw
and
gently
touching
the
ball
,
as
if
it
would
be
glad
to
help
,
if
it
*NL*
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
know
what
to-morrow
is
,
Kitty
?
'
Alice
began
.
`
You
'd
have
guessed
*NL*
if
you
'd
been
up
in
the
window
with
me
--
only
Dinah
was
making
you
tidy
,
*NL*
so
you
could
n't
.
I
was
watching
the
boys
getting
in
sticks
for
the
*NL*
bonfire
--
and
it
wants
plenty
of
sticks
,
Kitty
!
Only
it
got
so
cold
,
and
*NL*
it
snowed
so
,
they
had
to
leave
off
.
Never
mind
,
Kitty
,
we
'll
go
and
*NL*
see
the
bonfire
to-morrow
.
'
Here
Alice
wound
two
or
three
turns
of
the
*NL*
worsted
round
the
kitten
's
neck
,
just
to
see
how
it
would
look
:
this
led
*NL*
to
a
scramble
,
in
which
the
ball
rolled
down
upon
the
floor
,
and
yards
*NL*
and
yards
of
it
got
unwound
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
know
,
I
was
so
angry
,
Kitty
,
'
Alice
went
on
as
soon
as
they
were
*NL*
comfortably
settled
again
,
`
when
I
saw
all
the
mischief
you
had
been
*NL*
doing
,
I
was
very
nearly
opening
the
window
,
and
putting
you
out
into
*NL*
the
snow
!
And
you
'd
have
deserved
it
,
you
little
mischievous
darling
!
*NL*
What
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
?
Now
do
n't
interrupt
me
!
'
she
*NL*
went
on
,
holding
up
one
finger
.
`
I
'm
going
to
tell
you
all
your
faults
.
*NL*
Number
one
:
you
squeaked
twice
while
Dinah
was
washing
your
face
this
*NL*
morning
.
Now
you
ca
n't
deny
it
,
Kitty
:
I
heard
you
!
What
's
that
you
*NL*
say
?
'
-LRB-
pretending
that
the
kitten
was
speaking
.
-RRB-
`
Her
paw
went
into
your
*NL*
eye
?
Well
,
that
's
YOUR
fault
,
for
keeping
your
eyes
open
--
if
you
'd
*NL*
shut
them
tight
up
,
it
would
n't
have
happened
.
Now
do
n't
make
any
more
*NL*
excuses
,
but
listen
!
Number
two
:
you
pulled
Snowdrop
away
by
the
tail
*NL*
just
as
I
had
put
down
the
saucer
of
milk
before
her
!
What
,
you
were
*NL*
thirsty
,
were
you
?
How
do
you
know
she
was
n't
thirsty
too
?
Now
for
*NL*
number
three
:
you
unwound
every
bit
of
the
worsted
while
I
was
n't
*NL*
looking
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
three
faults
,
Kitty
,
and
you
've
not
been
punished
for
any
of
*NL*
them
yet
.
You
know
I
'm
saving
up
all
your
punishments
for
Wednesday
*NL*
week
--
Suppose
they
had
saved
up
all
MY
punishments
!
'
she
went
on
,
*NL*
talking
more
to
herself
than
the
kitten
.
`
What
WOULD
they
do
at
the
end
*NL*
of
a
year
?
I
should
be
sent
to
prison
,
I
suppose
,
when
the
day
came
.
*NL*
Or
--
let
me
see
--
suppose
each
punishment
was
to
be
going
without
a
*NL*
dinner
:
then
,
when
the
miserable
day
came
,
I
should
have
to
go
without
*NL*
fifty
dinners
at
once
!
Well
,
I
should
n't
mind
THAT
much
!
I
'd
far
rather
*NL*
go
without
them
than
eat
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
hear
the
snow
against
the
window-panes
,
Kitty
?
How
nice
and
soft
*NL*
it
sounds
!
Just
as
if
some
one
was
kissing
the
window
all
over
outside
.
*NL*
I
wonder
if
the
snow
LOVES
the
trees
and
fields
,
that
it
kisses
them
so
*NL*
gently
?
And
then
it
covers
them
up
snug
,
you
know
,
with
a
white
quilt
;
*NL*
and
perhaps
it
says
,
``
Go
to
sleep
,
darlings
,
till
the
summer
comes
*NL*
again
.
''
And
when
they
wake
up
in
the
summer
,
Kitty
,
they
dress
*NL*
themselves
all
in
green
,
and
dance
about
--
whenever
the
wind
blows
--
oh
,
*NL*
that
's
very
pretty
!
'
cried
Alice
,
dropping
the
ball
of
worsted
to
clap
*NL*
her
hands
.
`
And
I
do
so
WISH
it
was
true
!
I
'm
sure
the
woods
look
sleepy
*NL*
in
the
autumn
,
when
the
leaves
are
getting
brown
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Kitty
,
can
you
play
chess
?
Now
,
do
n't
smile
,
my
dear
,
I
'm
asking
it
*NL*
seriously
.
Because
,
when
we
were
playing
just
now
,
you
watched
just
as
*NL*
if
you
understood
it
:
and
when
I
said
``
Check
!
''
you
purred
!
Well
,
it
WAS
*NL*
a
nice
check
,
Kitty
,
and
really
I
might
have
won
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
*NL*
that
nasty
Knight
,
that
came
wiggling
down
among
my
pieces
.
Kitty
,
dear
,
*NL*
let
's
pretend
--
'
And
here
I
wish
I
could
tell
you
half
the
things
Alice
*NL*
used
to
say
,
beginning
with
her
favourite
phrase
`
Let
's
pretend
.
'
She
*NL*
had
had
quite
a
long
argument
with
her
sister
only
the
day
before
--
all
*NL*
because
Alice
had
begun
with
`
Let
's
pretend
we
're
kings
and
queens
;
'
and
*NL*
her
sister
,
who
liked
being
very
exact
,
had
argued
that
they
could
n't
,
*NL*
because
there
were
only
two
of
them
,
and
Alice
had
been
reduced
at
last
*NL*
to
say
,
`
Well
,
YOU
can
be
one
of
them
then
,
and
I
'LL
be
all
the
rest
.
'
*NL*
And
once
she
had
really
frightened
her
old
nurse
by
shouting
suddenly
in
*NL*
her
ear
,
`
Nurse
!
Do
let
's
pretend
that
I
'm
a
hungry
hyaena
,
and
you
're
a
*NL*
bone
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
is
taking
us
away
from
Alice
's
speech
to
the
kitten
.
`
Let
's
*NL*
pretend
that
you
're
the
Red
Queen
,
Kitty
!
Do
you
know
,
I
think
if
you
*NL*
sat
up
and
folded
your
arms
,
you
'd
look
exactly
like
her
.
Now
do
try
,
*NL*
there
's
a
dear
!
'
And
Alice
got
the
Red
Queen
off
the
table
,
and
set
it
*NL*
up
before
the
kitten
as
a
model
for
it
to
imitate
:
however
,
the
thing
*NL*
did
n't
succeed
,
principally
,
Alice
said
,
because
the
kitten
would
n't
*NL*
fold
its
arms
properly
.
So
,
to
punish
it
,
she
held
it
up
to
the
*NL*
Looking-glass
,
that
it
might
see
how
sulky
it
was
--
`
and
if
you
're
not
*NL*
good
directly
,
'
she
added
,
`
I
'll
put
you
through
into
Looking-glass
*NL*
House
.
How
would
you
like
THAT
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
if
you
'll
only
attend
,
Kitty
,
and
not
talk
so
much
,
I
'll
tell
you
*NL*
all
my
ideas
about
Looking-glass
House
.
First
,
there
's
the
room
you
can
*NL*
see
through
the
glass
--
that
's
just
the
same
as
our
drawing
room
,
only
*NL*
the
things
go
the
other
way
.
I
can
see
all
of
it
when
I
get
upon
a
*NL*
chair
--
all
but
the
bit
behind
the
fireplace
.
Oh
!
I
do
so
wish
I
could
*NL*
see
THAT
bit
!
I
want
so
much
to
know
whether
they
've
a
fire
in
the
*NL*
winter
:
you
never
CAN
tell
,
you
know
,
unless
our
fire
smokes
,
and
then
*NL*
smoke
comes
up
in
that
room
too
--
but
that
may
be
only
pretence
,
just
to
*NL*
make
it
look
as
if
they
had
a
fire
.
Well
then
,
the
books
are
something
*NL*
like
our
books
,
only
the
words
go
the
wrong
way
;
I
know
that
,
because
*NL*
I
've
held
up
one
of
our
books
to
the
glass
,
and
then
they
hold
up
one
in
*NL*
the
other
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
would
you
like
to
live
in
Looking-glass
House
,
Kitty
?
I
wonder
if
*NL*
they
'd
give
you
milk
in
there
?
Perhaps
Looking-glass
milk
is
n't
good
*NL*
to
drink
--
But
oh
,
Kitty
!
now
we
come
to
the
passage
.
You
can
just
see
a
*NL*
little
PEEP
of
the
passage
in
Looking-glass
House
,
if
you
leave
the
door
*NL*
of
our
drawing-room
wide
open
:
and
it
's
very
like
our
passage
as
far
*NL*
as
you
can
see
,
only
you
know
it
may
be
quite
different
on
beyond
.
*NL*
Oh
,
Kitty
!
how
nice
it
would
be
if
we
could
only
get
through
into
*NL*
Looking-glass
House
!
I
'm
sure
it
's
got
,
oh
!
such
beautiful
things
in
it
!
*NL*
Let
's
pretend
there
's
a
way
of
getting
through
into
it
,
somehow
,
Kitty
.
*NL*
Let
's
pretend
the
glass
has
got
all
soft
like
gauze
,
so
that
we
can
get
*NL*
through
.
Why
,
it
's
turning
into
a
sort
of
mist
now
,
I
declare
!
It
'll
be
*NL*
easy
enough
to
get
through
--
'
She
was
up
on
the
chimney-piece
while
she
*NL*
said
this
,
though
she
hardly
knew
how
she
had
got
there
.
And
certainly
*NL*
the
glass
WAS
beginning
to
melt
away
,
just
like
a
bright
silvery
mist
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
moment
Alice
was
through
the
glass
,
and
had
jumped
lightly
*NL*
down
into
the
Looking-glass
room
.
The
very
first
thing
she
did
was
*NL*
to
look
whether
there
was
a
fire
in
the
fireplace
,
and
she
was
quite
*NL*
pleased
to
find
that
there
was
a
real
one
,
blazing
away
as
brightly
as
*NL*
the
one
she
had
left
behind
.
`
So
I
shall
be
as
warm
here
as
I
was
in
the
*NL*
old
room
,
'
thought
Alice
:
`
warmer
,
in
fact
,
because
there
'll
be
no
one
*NL*
here
to
scold
me
away
from
the
fire
.
Oh
,
what
fun
it
'll
be
,
when
they
*NL*
see
me
through
the
glass
in
here
,
and
ca
n't
get
at
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
began
looking
about
,
and
noticed
that
what
could
be
seen
from
*NL*
the
old
room
was
quite
common
and
uninteresting
,
but
that
all
the
rest
*NL*
was
as
different
as
possible
.
For
instance
,
the
pictures
on
the
*NL*
wall
next
the
fire
seemed
to
be
all
alive
,
and
the
very
clock
on
*NL*
the
chimney-piece
-LRB-
you
know
you
can
only
see
the
back
of
it
in
the
*NL*
Looking-glass
-RRB-
had
got
the
face
of
a
little
old
man
,
and
grinned
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
do
n't
keep
this
room
so
tidy
as
the
other
,
'
Alice
thought
to
*NL*
herself
,
as
she
noticed
several
of
the
chessmen
down
in
the
hearth
among
*NL*
the
cinders
:
but
in
another
moment
,
with
a
little
`
Oh
!
'
of
surprise
,
she
*NL*
was
down
on
her
hands
and
knees
watching
them
.
The
chessmen
were
walking
*NL*
about
,
two
and
two
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
are
the
Red
King
and
the
Red
Queen
,
'
Alice
said
-LRB-
in
a
whisper
,
for
*NL*
fear
of
frightening
them
-RRB-
,
`
and
there
are
the
White
King
and
the
White
*NL*
Queen
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
shovel
--
and
here
are
two
castles
*NL*
walking
arm
in
arm
--
I
do
n't
think
they
can
hear
me
,
'
she
went
on
,
as
she
*NL*
put
her
head
closer
down
,
`
and
I
'm
nearly
sure
they
ca
n't
see
me
.
I
feel
*NL*
somehow
as
if
I
were
invisible
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
something
began
squeaking
on
the
table
behind
Alice
,
and
made
her
*NL*
turn
her
head
just
in
time
to
see
one
of
the
White
Pawns
roll
over
and
*NL*
begin
kicking
:
she
watched
it
with
great
curiosity
to
see
what
would
*NL*
happen
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
the
voice
of
my
child
!
'
the
White
Queen
cried
out
as
she
rushed
*NL*
past
the
King
,
so
violently
that
she
knocked
him
over
among
the
cinders
.
*NL*
`
My
precious
Lily
!
My
imperial
kitten
!
'
and
she
began
scrambling
wildly
*NL*
up
the
side
of
the
fender
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Imperial
fiddlestick
!
'
said
the
King
,
rubbing
his
nose
,
which
had
been
*NL*
hurt
by
the
fall
.
He
had
a
right
to
be
a
LITTLE
annoyed
with
the
Queen
,
*NL*
for
he
was
covered
with
ashes
from
head
to
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
was
very
anxious
to
be
of
use
,
and
,
as
the
poor
little
Lily
was
*NL*
nearly
screaming
herself
into
a
fit
,
she
hastily
picked
up
the
Queen
and
*NL*
set
her
on
the
table
by
the
side
of
her
noisy
little
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Queen
gasped
,
and
sat
down
:
the
rapid
journey
through
the
air
had
*NL*
quite
taken
away
her
breath
and
for
a
minute
or
two
she
could
do
nothing
*NL*
but
hug
the
little
Lily
in
silence
.
As
soon
as
she
had
recovered
her
*NL*
breath
a
little
,
she
called
out
to
the
White
King
,
who
was
sitting
*NL*
sulkily
among
the
ashes
,
`
Mind
the
volcano
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
volcano
?
'
said
the
King
,
looking
up
anxiously
into
the
fire
,
as
if
*NL*
he
thought
that
was
the
most
likely
place
to
find
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Blew
--
me
--
up
,
'
panted
the
Queen
,
who
was
still
a
little
out
of
breath
.
*NL*
`
Mind
you
come
up
--
the
regular
way
--
do
n't
get
blown
up
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
watched
the
White
King
as
he
slowly
struggled
up
from
bar
to
bar
,
*NL*
till
at
last
she
said
,
`
Why
,
you
'll
be
hours
and
hours
getting
to
the
*NL*
table
,
at
that
rate
.
I
'd
far
better
help
you
,
had
n't
I
?
'
But
the
King
*NL*
took
no
notice
of
the
question
:
it
was
quite
clear
that
he
could
neither
*NL*
hear
her
nor
see
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Alice
picked
him
up
very
gently
,
and
lifted
him
across
more
slowly
*NL*
than
she
had
lifted
the
Queen
,
that
she
might
n't
take
his
breath
away
:
*NL*
but
,
before
she
put
him
on
the
table
,
she
thought
she
might
as
well
dust
*NL*
him
a
little
,
he
was
so
covered
with
ashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
afterwards
that
she
had
never
seen
in
all
her
life
such
a
face
*NL*
as
the
King
made
,
when
he
found
himself
held
in
the
air
by
an
invisible
*NL*
hand
,
and
being
dusted
:
he
was
far
too
much
astonished
to
cry
out
,
but
*NL*
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
went
on
getting
larger
and
larger
,
and
rounder
*NL*
and
rounder
,
till
her
hand
shook
so
with
laughing
that
she
nearly
let
*NL*
him
drop
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
PLEASE
do
n't
make
such
faces
,
my
dear
!
'
she
cried
out
,
quite
*NL*
forgetting
that
the
King
could
n't
hear
her
.
`
You
make
me
laugh
so
that
*NL*
I
can
hardly
hold
you
!
And
do
n't
keep
your
mouth
so
wide
open
!
All
the
*NL*
ashes
will
get
into
it
--
there
,
now
I
think
you
're
tidy
enough
!
'
she
*NL*
added
,
as
she
smoothed
his
hair
,
and
set
him
upon
the
table
near
the
*NL*
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
King
immediately
fell
flat
on
his
back
,
and
lay
perfectly
still
:
and
*NL*
Alice
was
a
little
alarmed
at
what
she
had
done
,
and
went
round
the
room
*NL*
to
see
if
she
could
find
any
water
to
throw
over
him
.
However
,
she
could
*NL*
find
nothing
but
a
bottle
of
ink
,
and
when
she
got
back
with
it
she
*NL*
found
he
had
recovered
,
and
he
and
the
Queen
were
talking
together
in
a
*NL*
frightened
whisper
--
so
low
,
that
Alice
could
hardly
hear
what
they
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
King
was
saying
,
'
I
assure
,
you
my
dear
,
I
turned
cold
to
the
very
*NL*
ends
of
my
whiskers
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
the
Queen
replied
,
`
You
have
n't
got
any
whiskers
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
horror
of
that
moment
,
'
the
King
went
on
,
'
I
shall
never
,
NEVER
*NL*
forget
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
,
though
,
'
the
Queen
said
,
`
if
you
do
n't
make
a
memorandum
of
*NL*
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
looked
on
with
great
interest
as
the
King
took
an
enormous
*NL*
memorandum-book
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
began
writing
.
A
sudden
thought
*NL*
struck
her
,
and
she
took
hold
of
the
end
of
the
pencil
,
which
came
some
*NL*
way
over
his
shoulder
,
and
began
writing
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
King
looked
puzzled
and
unhappy
,
and
struggled
with
the
pencil
*NL*
for
some
time
without
saying
anything
;
but
Alice
was
too
strong
for
him
,
*NL*
and
at
last
he
panted
out
,
`
My
dear
!
I
really
MUST
get
a
thinner
pencil
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
manage
this
one
a
bit
;
it
writes
all
manner
of
things
that
I
*NL*
do
n't
intend
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
manner
of
things
?
'
said
the
Queen
,
looking
over
the
book
-LRB-
in
which
*NL*
Alice
had
put
`
THE
WHITE
KNIGHT
IS
SLIDING
DOWN
THE
POKER
.
HE
BALANCES
*NL*
VERY
BADLY
'
-RRB-
`
That
's
not
a
memorandum
of
YOUR
feelings
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
book
lying
near
Alice
on
the
table
,
and
while
she
sat
*NL*
watching
the
White
King
-LRB-
for
she
was
still
a
little
anxious
about
him
,
*NL*
and
had
the
ink
all
ready
to
throw
over
him
,
in
case
he
fainted
again
-RRB-
,
*NL*
she
turned
over
the
leaves
,
to
find
some
part
that
she
could
read
,
*NL*
'
--
for
it
's
all
in
some
language
I
do
n't
know
,
'
she
said
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
this

She
puzzled
over
this
for
some
time
,
but
at
last
a
bright
thought
struck
*NL*
her
.
`
Why
,
it
's
a
Looking-glass
book
,
of
course
!
And
if
I
hold
it
up

*NL*
a

*NL*
This
was
the
poem
that
Alice
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
JABBERWOCKY

*NL*
'T

`

Beware

'
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
vorpal
sword
in
hand
:
*NL*
Long
time
the
manxome
foe
he
sought
--
*NL*
So
rested
he
by
the
Tumtum
tree
,
*NL*
And
stood
awhile
in
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
in
uffish
thought
he
stood
,
*NL*
The
Jabberwock
,
with
eyes
of
flame
,
*NL*
Came
whiffling
through
the
tulgey
wood
,
*NL*
And
burbled
as
it
came

*NL*
*NL*
One

two
!
One

And
through
and
through
*NL*
The
vorpal
blade
went
snicker-snack
!
*NL*
He
left
it
dead
,
and
with
its
head
*NL*
He
went
galumphing
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
hast

slain

O

*NL*
He
chortled
in
his
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
brillig
,
and
the
slithy

*NL*
Did

*NL*
*NL*
`
It

pretty

she
said
when
she
had
finished
it
,
`
but
it
's
*NL*
RATHER
hard
to
understand
!
'
-LRB-
You
see
she
did
n't
like
to
confess
,
even
*NL*
to
herself
,
that
she
could
n't
make
it
out
at
all
.
-RRB-
`
Somehow
it
seems
*NL*
to
fill
my
head
with
ideas
--
only
I
do
n't
exactly
know
what
they
are
!
*NL*
However
,
SOMEBODY
killed
SOMETHING
:
that
's
clear
,
at
any
rate
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
oh
!
'
thought
Alice
,
suddenly
jumping
up
,
`
if
I
do
n't
make
haste
I
*NL*
shall
have
to
go
back
through
the
Looking-glass
,
before
I
've
seen
what
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
house
is
like
!
Let
's
have
a
look
at
the
garden
first
!
'
*NL*
She
was
out
of
the
room
in
a
moment
,
and
ran
down
stairs
--
or
,
at
least
,
*NL*
it
was
n't
exactly
running
,
but
a
new
invention
of
hers
for
getting
down
*NL*
stairs
quickly
and
easily
,
as
Alice
said
to
herself
.
She
just
kept
the
*NL*
tips
of
her
fingers
on
the
hand-rail
,
and
floated
gently
down
without
*NL*
even
touching
the
stairs
with
her
feet
;
then
she
floated
on
through
the
*NL*
hall
,
and
would
have
gone
straight
out
at
the
door
in
the
same
way
,
if
*NL*
she
had
n't
caught
hold
of
the
door-post
.
She
was
getting
a
little
giddy
*NL*
with
so
much
floating
in
the
air
,
and
was
rather
glad
to
find
herself
*NL*
walking
again
in
the
natural
way
.

CHAPTER
II
.
The
Garden
of
Live
Flowers
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
see
the
garden
far
better
,
'
said
Alice
to
herself
,
`
if
I
could
*NL*
get
to
the
top
of
that
hill
:
and
here
's
a
path
that
leads
straight
to
*NL*
it
--
at
least
,
no
,
it
does
n't
do
that
--
'
-LRB-
after
going
a
few
yards
along
*NL*
the
path
,
and
turning
several
sharp
corners
-RRB-
,
`
but
I
suppose
it
will
*NL*
at
last
.
But
how
curiously
it
twists
!
It
's
more
like
a
corkscrew
than
a
*NL*
path
!
Well
,
THIS
turn
goes
to
the
hill
,
I
suppose
--
no
,
it
does
n't
!
This
*NL*
goes
straight
back
to
the
house
!
Well
then
,
I
'll
try
it
the
other
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
she
did
:
wandering
up
and
down
,
and
trying
turn
after
turn
,
but
*NL*
always
coming
back
to
the
house
,
do
what
she
would
.
Indeed
,
once
,
when
*NL*
she
turned
a
corner
rather
more
quickly
than
usual
,
she
ran
against
it
*NL*
before
she
could
stop
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
no
use
talking
about
it
,
'
Alice
said
,
looking
up
at
the
house
and
*NL*
pretending
it
was
arguing
with
her
.
`
I
'm
NOT
going
in
again
yet
.
I
know
*NL*
I
should
have
to
get
through
the
Looking-glass
again
--
back
into
the
old
*NL*
room
--
and
there
'd
be
an
end
of
all
my
adventures
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
resolutely
turning
her
back
upon
the
house
,
she
set
out
once
more
*NL*
down
the
path
,
determined
to
keep
straight
on
till
she
got
to
the
hill
.
*NL*
For
a
few
minutes
all
went
on
well
,
and
she
was
just
saying
,
'
I
really
*NL*
SHALL
do
it
this
time
--
'
when
the
path
gave
a
sudden
twist
and
shook
*NL*
itself
-LRB-
as
she
described
it
afterwards
-RRB-
,
and
the
next
moment
she
found
*NL*
herself
actually
walking
in
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
it
's
too
bad
!
'
she
cried
.
'
I
never
saw
such
a
house
for
getting
in
*NL*
the
way
!
Never
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
there
was
the
hill
full
in
sight
,
so
there
was
nothing
to
be
*NL*
done
but
start
again
.
This
time
she
came
upon
a
large
flower-bed
,
with
a
*NL*
border
of
daisies
,
and
a
willow-tree
growing
in
the
middle
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
O
Tiger-lily
,
'
said
Alice
,
addressing
herself
to
one
that
was
waving
*NL*
gracefully
about
in
the
wind
,
'
I
WISH
you
could
talk
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
CAN
talk
,
'
said
the
Tiger-lily
:
`
when
there
's
anybody
worth
talking
*NL*
to
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
was
so
astonished
that
she
could
not
speak
for
a
minute
:
it
quite
*NL*
seemed
to
take
her
breath
away
.
At
length
,
as
the
Tiger-lily
only
went
*NL*
on
waving
about
,
she
spoke
again
,
in
a
timid
voice
--
almost
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
`
And
can
ALL
the
flowers
talk
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
well
as
YOU
can
,
'
said
the
Tiger-lily
.
`
And
a
great
deal
louder
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
n't
manners
for
us
to
begin
,
you
know
,
'
said
the
Rose
,
`
and
I
*NL*
really
was
wondering
when
you
'd
speak
!
Said
I
to
myself
,
``
Her
face
has
*NL*
got
SOME
sense
in
it
,
though
it
's
not
a
clever
one
!
''
Still
,
you
're
the
*NL*
right
colour
,
and
that
goes
a
long
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
care
about
the
colour
,
'
the
Tiger-lily
remarked
.
`
If
only
her
*NL*
petals
curled
up
a
little
more
,
she
'd
be
all
right
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
did
n't
like
being
criticised
,
so
she
began
asking
questions
.
*NL*
`
Are
n't
you
sometimes
frightened
at
being
planted
out
here
,
with
nobody
*NL*
to
take
care
of
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
the
tree
in
the
middle
,
'
said
the
Rose
:
`
what
else
is
it
good
*NL*
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
what
could
it
do
,
if
any
danger
came
?
'
Alice
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
says
``
Bough-wough
!
''
'
cried
a
Daisy
:
`
that
's
why
its
branches
are
*NL*
called
boughs
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
n't
you
know
THAT
?
'
cried
another
Daisy
,
and
here
they
all
began
*NL*
shouting
together
,
till
the
air
seemed
quite
full
of
little
shrill
*NL*
voices
.
`
Silence
,
every
one
of
you
!
'
cried
the
Tiger-lily
,
waving
itself
*NL*
passionately
from
side
to
side
,
and
trembling
with
excitement
.
`
They
*NL*
know
I
ca
n't
get
at
them
!
'
it
panted
,
bending
its
quivering
head
towards
*NL*
Alice
,
`
or
they
would
n't
dare
to
do
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Never
mind
!
'
Alice
said
in
a
soothing
tone
,
and
stooping
down
to
the
*NL*
daisies
,
who
were
just
beginning
again
,
she
whispered
,
`
If
you
do
n't
*NL*
hold
your
tongues
,
I
'll
pick
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
silence
in
a
moment
,
and
several
of
the
pink
daisies
turned
*NL*
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
right
!
'
said
the
Tiger-lily
.
`
The
daisies
are
worst
of
all
.
When
*NL*
one
speaks
,
they
all
begin
together
,
and
it
's
enough
to
make
one
wither
*NL*
to
hear
the
way
they
go
on
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
is
it
you
can
all
talk
so
nicely
?
'
Alice
said
,
hoping
to
get
it
*NL*
into
a
better
temper
by
a
compliment
.
`
I
've
been
in
many
gardens
before
,
*NL*
but
none
of
the
flowers
could
talk
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Put
your
hand
down
,
and
feel
the
ground
,
'
said
the
Tiger-lily
.
`
Then
*NL*
you
'll
know
why
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
did
so
.
`
It
's
very
hard
,
'
she
said
,
`
but
I
do
n't
see
what
that
has
*NL*
to
do
with
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
most
gardens
,
'
the
Tiger-lily
said
,
`
they
make
the
beds
too
soft
--
so
*NL*
that
the
flowers
are
always
asleep
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
sounded
a
very
good
reason
,
and
Alice
was
quite
pleased
to
know
it
.
*NL*
'
I
never
thought
of
that
before
!
'
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
MY
opinion
that
you
never
think
AT
ALL
,
'
the
Rose
said
in
a
rather
*NL*
severe
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
saw
anybody
that
looked
stupider
,
'
a
Violet
said
,
so
suddenly
,
*NL*
that
Alice
quite
jumped
;
for
it
had
n't
spoken
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hold
YOUR
tongue
!
'
cried
the
Tiger-lily
.
`
As
if
YOU
ever
saw
anybody
!
*NL*
You
keep
your
head
under
the
leaves
,
and
snore
away
there
,
till
you
know
*NL*
no
more
what
's
going
on
in
the
world
,
than
if
you
were
a
bud
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
there
any
more
people
in
the
garden
besides
me
?
'
Alice
said
,
not
*NL*
choosing
to
notice
the
Rose
's
last
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
one
other
flower
in
the
garden
that
can
move
about
like
you
,
'
*NL*
said
the
Rose
.
'
I
wonder
how
you
do
it
--
'
-LRB-
`
You
're
always
wondering
,
'
*NL*
said
the
Tiger-lily
-RRB-
,
`
but
she
's
more
bushy
than
you
are
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
she
like
me
?
'
Alice
asked
eagerly
,
for
the
thought
crossed
her
mind
,
*NL*
`
There
's
another
little
girl
in
the
garden
,
somewhere
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
she
has
the
same
awkward
shape
as
you
,
'
the
Rose
said
,
`
but
she
's
*NL*
redder
--
and
her
petals
are
shorter
,
I
think
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Her
petals
are
done
up
close
,
almost
like
a
dahlia
,
'
the
Tiger-lily
*NL*
interrupted
:
`
not
tumbled
about
anyhow
,
like
yours
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
that
's
not
YOUR
fault
,
'
the
Rose
added
kindly
:
`
you
're
beginning
*NL*
to
fade
,
you
know
--
and
then
one
ca
n't
help
one
's
petals
getting
a
little
*NL*
untidy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
did
n't
like
this
idea
at
all
:
so
,
to
change
the
subject
,
she
asked
*NL*
`
Does
she
ever
come
out
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
daresay
you
'll
see
her
soon
,
'
said
the
Rose
.
`
She
's
one
of
the
thorny
*NL*
kind
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
does
she
wear
the
thorns
?
'
Alice
asked
with
some
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
all
round
her
head
,
of
course
,
'
the
Rose
replied
.
'
I
was
wondering
*NL*
YOU
had
n't
got
some
too
.
I
thought
it
was
the
regular
rule
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
coming
!
'
cried
the
Larkspur
.
'
I
hear
her
footstep
,
thump
,
thump
,
*NL*
thump
,
along
the
gravel-walk
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
looked
round
eagerly
,
and
found
that
it
was
the
Red
Queen
.
`
She
's
*NL*
grown
a
good
deal
!
'
was
her
first
remark
.
She
had
indeed
:
when
Alice
*NL*
first
found
her
in
the
ashes
,
she
had
been
only
three
inches
high
--
and
*NL*
here
she
was
,
half
a
head
taller
than
Alice
herself
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
the
fresh
air
that
does
it
,
'
said
the
Rose
:
`
wonderfully
fine
air
*NL*
it
is
,
out
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
I
'll
go
and
meet
her
,
'
said
Alice
,
for
,
though
the
flowers
were
*NL*
interesting
enough
,
she
felt
that
it
would
be
far
grander
to
have
a
talk
*NL*
with
a
real
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
ca
n't
possibly
do
that
,
'
said
the
Rose
:
'
_
I
_
should
advise
you
to
*NL*
walk
the
other
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
sounded
nonsense
to
Alice
,
so
she
said
nothing
,
but
set
off
at
*NL*
once
towards
the
Red
Queen
.
To
her
surprise
,
she
lost
sight
of
her
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
found
herself
walking
in
at
the
front-door
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
provoked
,
she
drew
back
,
and
after
looking
everywhere
for
the
*NL*
queen
-LRB-
whom
she
spied
out
at
last
,
a
long
way
off
-RRB-
,
she
thought
she
*NL*
would
try
the
plan
,
this
time
,
of
walking
in
the
opposite
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
succeeded
beautifully
.
She
had
not
been
walking
a
minute
before
she
*NL*
found
herself
face
to
face
with
the
Red
Queen
,
and
full
in
sight
of
the
*NL*
hill
she
had
been
so
long
aiming
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
do
you
come
from
?
'
said
the
Red
Queen
.
`
And
where
are
you
going
?
*NL*
Look
up
,
speak
nicely
,
and
do
n't
twiddle
your
fingers
all
the
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
attended
to
all
these
directions
,
and
explained
,
as
well
as
she
*NL*
could
,
that
she
had
lost
her
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
YOUR
way
,
'
said
the
Queen
:
`
all
the
ways
*NL*
about
here
belong
to
ME
--
but
why
did
you
come
out
here
at
all
?
'
she
*NL*
added
in
a
kinder
tone
.
`
Curtsey
while
you
're
thinking
what
to
say
,
it
*NL*
saves
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
wondered
a
little
at
this
,
but
she
was
too
much
in
awe
of
the
*NL*
Queen
to
disbelieve
it
.
`
I
'll
try
it
when
I
go
home
,
'
she
thought
to
*NL*
herself
,
`
the
next
time
I
'm
a
little
late
for
dinner
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
time
for
you
to
answer
now
,
'
the
Queen
said
,
looking
at
her
watch
:
*NL*
`
open
your
mouth
a
LITTLE
wider
when
you
speak
,
and
always
say
``
your
*NL*
Majesty
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
only
wanted
to
see
what
the
garden
was
like
,
your
Majesty
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
right
,
'
said
the
Queen
,
patting
her
on
the
head
,
which
Alice
*NL*
did
n't
like
at
all
,
`
though
,
when
you
say
``
garden
,
''
--
I
'VE
seen
gardens
,
*NL*
compared
with
which
this
would
be
a
wilderness
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
did
n't
dare
to
argue
the
point
,
but
went
on
:
'
--
and
I
thought
I
'd
*NL*
try
and
find
my
way
to
the
top
of
that
hill
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
you
say
``
hill
,
''
'
the
Queen
interrupted
,
'
_
I
_
could
show
you
hills
,
*NL*
in
comparison
with
which
you
'd
call
that
a
valley
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
I
should
n't
,
'
said
Alice
,
surprised
into
contradicting
her
at
last
:
*NL*
'
a
hill
CA
N'T
be
a
valley
,
you
know
.
That
would
be
nonsense
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Red
Queen
shook
her
head
,
`
You
may
call
it
``
nonsense
''
if
you
like
,
'
*NL*
she
said
,
`
but
I
'VE
heard
nonsense
,
compared
with
which
that
would
be
as
*NL*
sensible
as
a
dictionary
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
curtseyed
again
,
as
she
was
afraid
from
the
Queen
's
tone
that
she
*NL*
was
a
LITTLE
offended
:
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
till
they
got
to
*NL*
the
top
of
the
little
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
minutes
Alice
stood
without
speaking
,
looking
out
in
all
*NL*
directions
over
the
country
--
and
a
most
curious
country
it
was
.
There
*NL*
were
a
number
of
tiny
little
brooks
running
straight
across
it
from
side
*NL*
to
side
,
and
the
ground
between
was
divided
up
into
squares
by
a
number
*NL*
of
little
green
hedges
,
that
reached
from
brook
to
brook
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
declare
it
's
marked
out
just
like
a
large
chessboard
!
'
Alice
said
at
*NL*
last
.
`
There
ought
to
be
some
men
moving
about
somewhere
--
and
so
there
*NL*
are
!
'
She
added
in
a
tone
of
delight
,
and
her
heart
began
to
beat
quick
*NL*
with
excitement
as
she
went
on
.
`
It
's
a
great
huge
game
of
chess
that
's
*NL*
being
played
--
all
over
the
world
--
if
this
IS
the
world
at
all
,
you
know
.
*NL*
Oh
,
what
fun
it
is
!
How
I
WISH
I
was
one
of
them
!
I
would
n't
mind
being
*NL*
a
Pawn
,
if
only
I
might
join
--
though
of
course
I
should
LIKE
to
be
a
*NL*
Queen
,
best
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
rather
shyly
at
the
real
Queen
as
she
said
this
,
but
her
*NL*
companion
only
smiled
pleasantly
,
and
said
,
`
That
's
easily
managed
.
You
*NL*
can
be
the
White
Queen
's
Pawn
,
if
you
like
,
as
Lily
's
too
young
to
*NL*
play
;
and
you
're
in
the
Second
Square
to
begin
with
:
when
you
get
to
*NL*
the
Eighth
Square
you
'll
be
a
Queen
--
'
Just
at
this
moment
,
somehow
or
*NL*
other
,
they
began
to
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
never
could
quite
make
out
,
in
thinking
it
over
afterwards
,
how
it
*NL*
was
that
they
began
:
all
she
remembers
is
,
that
they
were
running
hand
*NL*
in
hand
,
and
the
Queen
went
so
fast
that
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
keep
*NL*
up
with
her
:
and
still
the
Queen
kept
crying
`
Faster
!
Faster
!
'
but
Alice
*NL*
felt
she
COULD
NOT
go
faster
,
though
she
had
not
breath
left
to
say
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
curious
part
of
the
thing
was
,
that
the
trees
and
the
other
*NL*
things
round
them
never
changed
their
places
at
all
:
however
fast
they
*NL*
went
,
they
never
seemed
to
pass
anything
.
'
I
wonder
if
all
the
things
*NL*
move
along
with
us
?
'
thought
poor
puzzled
Alice
.
And
the
Queen
seemed
to
*NL*
guess
her
thoughts
,
for
she
cried
,
`
Faster
!
Do
n't
try
to
talk
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
Alice
had
any
idea
of
doing
THAT
.
She
felt
as
if
she
would
*NL*
never
be
able
to
talk
again
,
she
was
getting
so
much
out
of
breath
:
and
*NL*
still
the
Queen
cried
`
Faster
!
Faster
!
'
and
dragged
her
along
.
`
Are
we
*NL*
nearly
there
?
'
Alice
managed
to
pant
out
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nearly
there
!
'
the
Queen
repeated
.
`
Why
,
we
passed
it
ten
minutes
ago
!
*NL*
Faster
!
'
And
they
ran
on
for
a
time
in
silence
,
with
the
wind
whistling
*NL*
in
Alice
's
ears
,
and
almost
blowing
her
hair
off
her
head
,
she
fancied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
!
Now
!
'
cried
the
Queen
.
`
Faster
!
Faster
!
'
And
they
went
so
fast
*NL*
that
at
last
they
seemed
to
skim
through
the
air
,
hardly
touching
the
*NL*
ground
with
their
feet
,
till
suddenly
,
just
as
Alice
was
getting
quite
*NL*
exhausted
,
they
stopped
,
and
she
found
herself
sitting
on
the
ground
,
*NL*
breathless
and
giddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Queen
propped
her
up
against
a
tree
,
and
said
kindly
,
`
You
may
rest
*NL*
a
little
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
looked
round
her
in
great
surprise
.
`
Why
,
I
do
believe
we
've
been
*NL*
under
this
tree
the
whole
time
!
Everything
's
just
as
it
was
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
it
is
,
'
said
the
Queen
,
`
what
would
you
have
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
in
OUR
country
,
'
said
Alice
,
still
panting
a
little
,
`
you
'd
*NL*
generally
get
to
somewhere
else
--
if
you
ran
very
fast
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
as
we
've
been
doing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
slow
sort
of
country
!
'
said
the
Queen
.
`
Now
,
HERE
,
you
see
,
it
takes
*NL*
all
the
running
YOU
can
do
,
to
keep
in
the
same
place
.
If
you
want
to
*NL*
get
somewhere
else
,
you
must
run
at
least
twice
as
fast
as
that
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'd
rather
not
try
,
please
!
'
said
Alice
.
`
I
'm
quite
content
to
stay
*NL*
here
--
only
I
AM
so
hot
and
thirsty
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
what
YOU
'D
like
!
'
the
Queen
said
good-naturedly
,
taking
a
little
*NL*
box
out
of
her
pocket
.
`
Have
a
biscuit
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
thought
it
would
not
be
civil
to
say
`
No
,
'
though
it
was
n't
at
all
*NL*
what
she
wanted
.
So
she
took
it
,
and
ate
it
as
well
as
she
could
:
and
it
*NL*
was
VERY
dry
;
and
she
thought
she
had
never
been
so
nearly
choked
in
all
*NL*
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
While
you
're
refreshing
yourself
,
'
said
the
Queen
,
`
I
'll
just
take
*NL*
the
measurements
.
'
And
she
took
a
ribbon
out
of
her
pocket
,
marked
in
*NL*
inches
,
and
began
measuring
the
ground
,
and
sticking
little
pegs
in
here
*NL*
and
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
the
end
of
two
yards
,
'
she
said
,
putting
in
a
peg
to
mark
the
*NL*
distance
,
'
I
shall
give
you
your
directions
--
have
another
biscuit
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
thank
you
,
'
said
Alice
:
`
one
's
QUITE
enough
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thirst
quenched
,
I
hope
?
'
said
the
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
did
not
know
what
to
say
to
this
,
but
luckily
the
Queen
did
not
*NL*
wait
for
an
answer
,
but
went
on
.
`
At
the
end
of
THREE
yards
I
shall
*NL*
repeat
them
--
for
fear
of
your
forgetting
them
.
At
the
end
of
FOUR
,
I
*NL*
shall
say
good-bye
.
And
at
the
end
of
FIVE
,
I
shall
go
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
got
all
the
pegs
put
in
by
this
time
,
and
Alice
looked
on
*NL*
with
great
interest
as
she
returned
to
the
tree
,
and
then
began
slowly
*NL*
walking
down
the
row
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
two-yard
peg
she
faced
round
,
and
said
,
'
A
pawn
goes
two
squares
*NL*
in
its
first
move
,
you
know
.
So
you
'll
go
VERY
quickly
through
the
Third
*NL*
Square
--
by
railway
,
I
should
think
--
and
you
'll
find
yourself
in
the
*NL*
Fourth
Square
in
no
time
.
Well
,
THAT
square
belongs
to
Tweedledum
and
*NL*
Tweedledee
--
the
Fifth
is
mostly
water
--
the
Sixth
belongs
to
Humpty
*NL*
Dumpty
--
But
you
make
no
remark
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
--
I
did
n't
know
I
had
to
make
one
--
just
then
,
'
Alice
faltered
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
SHOULD
have
said
,
``
It
's
extremely
kind
of
you
to
tell
me
all
*NL*
this
''
--
however
,
we
'll
suppose
it
said
--
the
Seventh
Square
is
all
*NL*
forest
--
however
,
one
of
the
Knights
will
show
you
the
way
--
and
in
the
*NL*
Eighth
Square
we
shall
be
Queens
together
,
and
it
's
all
feasting
and
*NL*
fun
!
'
Alice
got
up
and
curtseyed
,
and
sat
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
next
peg
the
Queen
turned
again
,
and
this
time
she
said
,
`
Speak
*NL*
in
French
when
you
ca
n't
think
of
the
English
for
a
thing
--
turn
out
your
*NL*
toes
as
you
walk
--
and
remember
who
you
are
!
'
She
did
not
wait
for
Alice
*NL*
to
curtsey
this
time
,
but
walked
on
quickly
to
the
next
peg
,
where
she
*NL*
turned
for
a
moment
to
say
`
good-bye
,
'
and
then
hurried
on
to
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
it
happened
,
Alice
never
knew
,
but
exactly
as
she
came
to
the
last
*NL*
peg
,
she
was
gone
.
Whether
she
vanished
into
the
air
,
or
whether
she
*NL*
ran
quickly
into
the
wood
-LRB-
`
and
she
CAN
run
very
fast
!
'
thought
Alice
-RRB-
,
*NL*
there
was
no
way
of
guessing
,
but
she
was
gone
,
and
Alice
began
to
*NL*
remember
that
she
was
a
Pawn
,
and
that
it
would
soon
be
time
for
her
to
*NL*
move
.

CHAPTER
III
.
Looking-Glass
Insects
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
make
a
grand
survey
of
the
*NL*
country
she
was
going
to
travel
through
.
`
It
's
something
very
like
*NL*
learning
geography
,
'
thought
Alice
,
as
she
stood
on
tiptoe
in
hopes
of
*NL*
being
able
to
see
a
little
further
.
`
Principal
rivers
--
there
ARE
none
.
*NL*
Principal
mountains
--
I
'm
on
the
only
one
,
but
I
do
n't
think
it
's
got
any
*NL*
name
.
Principal
towns
--
why
,
what
ARE
those
creatures
,
making
honey
down
*NL*
there
?
They
ca
n't
be
bees
--
nobody
ever
saw
bees
a
mile
off
,
you
know
--
'
*NL*
and
for
some
time
she
stood
silent
,
watching
one
of
them
that
was
*NL*
bustling
about
among
the
flowers
,
poking
its
proboscis
into
them
,
`
just
*NL*
as
if
it
was
a
regular
bee
,
'
thought
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
this
was
anything
but
a
regular
bee
:
in
fact
it
was
an
*NL*
elephant
--
as
Alice
soon
found
out
,
though
the
idea
quite
took
her
breath
*NL*
away
at
first
.
`
And
what
enormous
flowers
they
must
be
!
'
was
her
next
*NL*
idea
.
`
Something
like
cottages
with
the
roofs
taken
off
,
and
stalks
put
*NL*
to
them
--
and
what
quantities
of
honey
they
must
make
!
I
think
I
'll
go
*NL*
down
and
--
no
,
I
wo
n't
JUST
yet
,
'
she
went
on
,
checking
herself
just
as
*NL*
she
was
beginning
to
run
down
the
hill
,
and
trying
to
find
some
excuse
*NL*
for
turning
shy
so
suddenly
.
`
It
'll
never
do
to
go
down
among
them
*NL*
without
a
good
long
branch
to
brush
them
away
--
and
what
fun
it
'll
be
*NL*
when
they
ask
me
how
I
like
my
walk
.
I
shall
say
--
``
Oh
,
I
like
it
well
*NL*
enough
--
''
'
-LRB-
here
came
the
favourite
little
toss
of
the
head
-RRB-
,
'
``
only
it
*NL*
was
so
dusty
and
hot
,
and
the
elephants
did
tease
so
!
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
I
'll
go
down
the
other
way
,
'
she
said
after
a
pause
:
`
and
*NL*
perhaps
I
may
visit
the
elephants
later
on
.
Besides
,
I
do
so
want
to
get
*NL*
into
the
Third
Square
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
with
this
excuse
she
ran
down
the
hill
and
jumped
over
the
first
of
*NL*
the
six
little
brooks
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tickets
,
please
!
'
said
the
Guard
,
putting
his
head
in
at
the
window
.
*NL*
In
a
moment
everybody
was
holding
out
a
ticket
:
they
were
about
the
same
*NL*
size
as
the
people
,
and
quite
seemed
to
fill
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
then
!
Show
your
ticket
,
child
!
'
the
Guard
went
on
,
looking
angrily
*NL*
at
Alice
.
And
a
great
many
voices
all
said
together
-LRB-
`
like
the
chorus
of
*NL*
a
song
,
'
thought
Alice
-RRB-
,
`
Do
n't
keep
him
waiting
,
child
!
Why
,
his
time
*NL*
is
worth
a
thousand
pounds
a
minute
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
afraid
I
have
n't
got
one
,
'
Alice
said
in
a
frightened
tone
:
`
there
*NL*
was
n't
a
ticket-office
where
I
came
from
.
'
And
again
the
chorus
of
*NL*
voices
went
on
.
`
There
was
n't
room
for
one
where
she
came
from
.
The
land
*NL*
there
is
worth
a
thousand
pounds
an
inch
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
make
excuses
,
'
said
the
Guard
:
`
you
should
have
bought
one
from
*NL*
the
engine-driver
.
'
And
once
more
the
chorus
of
voices
went
on
with
`
The
*NL*
man
that
drives
the
engine
.
Why
,
the
smoke
alone
is
worth
a
thousand
*NL*
pounds
a
puff
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
thought
to
herself
,
`
Then
there
's
no
use
in
speaking
.
'
The
*NL*
voices
did
n't
join
in
this
time
,
as
she
had
n't
spoken
,
but
to
her
*NL*
great
surprise
,
they
all
THOUGHT
in
chorus
-LRB-
I
hope
you
understand
what
*NL*
THINKING
IN
CHORUS
means
--
for
I
must
confess
that
_
I
_
do
n't
-RRB-
,
`
Better
*NL*
say
nothing
at
all
.
Language
is
worth
a
thousand
pounds
a
word
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shall
dream
about
a
thousand
pounds
tonight
,
I
know
I
shall
!
'
thought
*NL*
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
the
Guard
was
looking
at
her
,
first
through
a
telescope
,
*NL*
then
through
a
microscope
,
and
then
through
an
opera-glass
.
At
last
he
*NL*
said
,
`
You
're
travelling
the
wrong
way
,
'
and
shut
up
the
window
and
went
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
young
a
child
,
'
said
the
gentleman
sitting
opposite
to
her
-LRB-
he
was
*NL*
dressed
in
white
paper
-RRB-
,
`
ought
to
know
which
way
she
's
going
,
even
if
*NL*
she
does
n't
know
her
own
name
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
Goat
,
that
was
sitting
next
to
the
gentleman
in
white
,
shut
his
*NL*
eyes
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
,
`
She
ought
to
know
her
way
to
the
*NL*
ticket-office
,
even
if
she
does
n't
know
her
alphabet
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
Beetle
sitting
next
to
the
Goat
-LRB-
it
was
a
very
queer
*NL*
carriage-full
of
passengers
altogether
-RRB-
,
and
,
as
the
rule
seemed
to
be
*NL*
that
they
should
all
speak
in
turn
,
HE
went
on
with
`
She
'll
have
to
go
*NL*
back
from
here
as
luggage
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
could
n't
see
who
was
sitting
beyond
the
Beetle
,
but
a
hoarse
voice
*NL*
spoke
next
.
`
Change
engines
--
'
it
said
,
and
was
obliged
to
leave
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
sounds
like
a
horse
,
'
Alice
thought
to
herself
.
And
an
extremely
*NL*
small
voice
,
close
to
her
ear
,
said
,
`
You
might
make
a
joke
on
*NL*
that
--
something
about
``
horse
''
and
``
hoarse
,
''
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
very
gentle
voice
in
the
distance
said
,
`
She
must
be
labelled
*NL*
``
Lass
,
with
care
,
''
you
know
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
that
other
voices
went
on
-LRB-
`
What
a
number
of
people
there
are
*NL*
in
the
carriage
!
'
thought
Alice
-RRB-
,
saying
,
`
She
must
go
by
post
,
as
she
's
*NL*
got
a
head
on
her
--
'
`
She
must
be
sent
as
a
message
by
the
telegraph
--
'
*NL*
`
She
must
draw
the
train
herself
the
rest
of
the
way
--
'
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
gentleman
dressed
in
white
paper
leaned
forwards
and
whispered
*NL*
in
her
ear
,
`
Never
mind
what
they
all
say
,
my
dear
,
but
take
a
*NL*
return-ticket
every
time
the
train
stops
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
I
sha
n't
!
'
Alice
said
rather
impatiently
.
'
I
do
n't
belong
to
*NL*
this
railway
journey
at
all
--
I
was
in
a
wood
just
now
--
and
I
wish
I
*NL*
could
get
back
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
might
make
a
joke
on
THAT
,
'
said
the
little
voice
close
to
her
ear
:
*NL*
`
something
about
``
you
WOULD
if
you
could
,
''
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
tease
so
,
'
said
Alice
,
looking
about
in
vain
to
see
where
the
*NL*
voice
came
from
;
`
if
you
're
so
anxious
to
have
a
joke
made
,
why
do
n't
*NL*
you
make
one
yourself
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
voice
sighed
deeply
:
it
was
VERY
unhappy
,
evidently
,
and
*NL*
Alice
would
have
said
something
pitying
to
comfort
it
,
`
If
it
would
only
*NL*
sigh
like
other
people
!
'
she
thought
.
But
this
was
such
a
wonderfully
*NL*
small
sigh
,
that
she
would
n't
have
heard
it
at
all
,
if
it
had
n't
come
*NL*
QUITE
close
to
her
ear
.
The
consequence
of
this
was
that
it
tickled
her
*NL*
ear
very
much
,
and
quite
took
off
her
thoughts
from
the
unhappiness
of
*NL*
the
poor
little
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
you
are
a
friend
,
'
the
little
voice
went
on
;
'
a
dear
friend
,
and
*NL*
an
old
friend
.
And
you
wo
n't
hurt
me
,
though
I
AM
an
insect
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
kind
of
insect
?
'
Alice
inquired
a
little
anxiously
.
What
she
*NL*
really
wanted
to
know
was
,
whether
it
could
sting
or
not
,
but
she
*NL*
thought
this
would
n't
be
quite
a
civil
question
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
,
then
you
do
n't
--
'
the
little
voice
began
,
when
it
was
drowned
by
*NL*
a
shrill
scream
from
the
engine
,
and
everybody
jumped
up
in
alarm
,
Alice
*NL*
among
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Horse
,
who
had
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
,
quietly
drew
it
in
*NL*
and
said
,
`
It
's
only
a
brook
we
have
to
jump
over
.
'
Everybody
seemed
*NL*
satisfied
with
this
,
though
Alice
felt
a
little
nervous
at
the
idea
of
*NL*
trains
jumping
at
all
.
`
However
,
it
'll
take
us
into
the
Fourth
Square
,
*NL*
that
's
some
comfort
!
'
she
said
to
herself
.
In
another
moment
she
felt
*NL*
the
carriage
rise
straight
up
into
the
air
,
and
in
her
fright
she
caught
*NL*
at
the
thing
nearest
to
her
hand
,
which
happened
to
be
the
Goat
's
beard
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
beard
seemed
to
melt
away
as
she
touched
it
,
and
she
found
*NL*
herself
sitting
quietly
under
a
tree
--
while
the
Gnat
-LRB-
for
that
was
the
*NL*
insect
she
had
been
talking
to
-RRB-
was
balancing
itself
on
a
twig
just
over
*NL*
her
head
,
and
fanning
her
with
its
wings
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
certainly
was
a
VERY
large
Gnat
:
`
about
the
size
of
a
chicken
,
'
Alice
*NL*
thought
.
Still
,
she
could
n't
feel
nervous
with
it
,
after
they
had
been
*NL*
talking
together
so
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
then
you
do
n't
like
all
insects
?
'
the
Gnat
went
on
,
as
quietly
as
if
*NL*
nothing
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
like
them
when
they
can
talk
,
'
Alice
said
.
`
None
of
them
ever
talk
,
*NL*
where
_
I
_
come
from
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
sort
of
insects
do
you
rejoice
in
,
where
YOU
come
from
?
'
the
Gnat
*NL*
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
REJOICE
in
insects
at
all
,
'
Alice
explained
,
`
because
I
'm
*NL*
rather
afraid
of
them
--
at
least
the
large
kinds
.
But
I
can
tell
you
the
*NL*
names
of
some
of
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
they
answer
to
their
names
?
'
the
Gnat
remarked
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
knew
them
to
do
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
use
of
their
having
names
,
'
the
Gnat
said
,
`
if
they
wo
n't
*NL*
answer
to
them
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
use
to
THEM
,
'
said
Alice
;
`
but
it
's
useful
to
the
people
who
name
*NL*
them
,
I
suppose
.
If
not
,
why
do
things
have
names
at
all
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
say
,
'
the
Gnat
replied
.
`
Further
on
,
in
the
wood
down
there
,
*NL*
they
've
got
no
names
--
however
,
go
on
with
your
list
of
insects
:
you
're
*NL*
wasting
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
there
's
the
Horse-fly
,
'
Alice
began
,
counting
off
the
names
on
*NL*
her
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
right
,
'
said
the
Gnat
:
`
half
way
up
that
bush
,
you
'll
see
a
*NL*
Rocking-horse-fly
,
if
you
look
.
It
's
made
entirely
of
wood
,
and
gets
*NL*
about
by
swinging
itself
from
branch
to
branch
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
does
it
live
on
?
'
Alice
asked
,
with
great
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sap
and
sawdust
,
'
said
the
Gnat
.
`
Go
on
with
the
list
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
looked
up
at
the
Rocking-horse-fly
with
great
interest
,
and
made
*NL*
up
her
mind
that
it
must
have
been
just
repainted
,
it
looked
so
bright
*NL*
and
sticky
;
and
then
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
there
's
the
Dragon-fly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
on
the
branch
above
your
head
,
'
said
the
Gnat
,
`
and
there
you
'll
*NL*
find
a
snap-dragon-fly
.
Its
body
is
made
of
plum-pudding
,
its
wings
of
*NL*
holly-leaves
,
and
its
head
is
a
raisin
burning
in
brandy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
does
it
live
on
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Frumenty
and
mince
pie
,
'
the
Gnat
replied
;
`
and
it
makes
its
nest
in
a
*NL*
Christmas
box
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
then
there
's
the
Butterfly
,
'
Alice
went
on
,
after
she
had
taken
*NL*
a
good
look
at
the
insect
with
its
head
on
fire
,
and
had
thought
to
*NL*
herself
,
'
I
wonder
if
that
's
the
reason
insects
are
so
fond
of
flying
*NL*
into
candles
--
because
they
want
to
turn
into
Snap-dragon-flies
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Crawling
at
your
feet
,
'
said
the
Gnat
-LRB-
Alice
drew
her
feet
back
in
*NL*
some
alarm
-RRB-
,
`
you
may
observe
a
Bread-and-Butterfly
.
Its
wings
are
thin
*NL*
slices
of
Bread-and-butter
,
its
body
is
a
crust
,
and
its
head
is
a
lump
*NL*
of
sugar
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
does
IT
live
on
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Weak
tea
with
cream
in
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
new
difficulty
came
into
Alice
's
head
.
`
Supposing
it
could
n't
find
*NL*
any
?
'
she
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
it
would
die
,
of
course
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
that
must
happen
very
often
,
'
Alice
remarked
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
always
happens
,
'
said
the
Gnat
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
Alice
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
,
pondering
.
The
Gnat
*NL*
amused
itself
meanwhile
by
humming
round
and
round
her
head
:
at
last
*NL*
it
settled
again
and
remarked
,
'
I
suppose
you
do
n't
want
to
lose
your
*NL*
name
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
indeed
,
'
Alice
said
,
a
little
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
yet
I
do
n't
know
,
'
the
Gnat
went
on
in
a
careless
tone
:
`
only
think
*NL*
how
convenient
it
would
be
if
you
could
manage
to
go
home
without
it
!
*NL*
For
instance
,
if
the
governess
wanted
to
call
you
to
your
lessons
,
she
*NL*
would
call
out
``
come
here
--
,
''
and
there
she
would
have
to
leave
off
,
*NL*
because
there
would
n't
be
any
name
for
her
to
call
,
and
of
course
you
*NL*
would
n't
have
to
go
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
would
never
do
,
I
'm
sure
,
'
said
Alice
:
`
the
governess
would
never
*NL*
think
of
excusing
me
lessons
for
that
.
If
she
could
n't
remember
my
name
,
*NL*
she
'd
call
me
``
Miss
!
''
as
the
servants
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
if
she
said
``
Miss
,
''
and
did
n't
say
anything
more
,
'
the
Gnat
*NL*
remarked
,
`
of
course
you
'd
miss
your
lessons
.
That
's
a
joke
.
I
wish
YOU
*NL*
had
made
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
do
you
wish
_
I
_
had
made
it
?
'
Alice
asked
.
`
It
's
a
very
bad
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Gnat
only
sighed
deeply
,
while
two
large
tears
came
rolling
down
*NL*
its
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
should
n't
make
jokes
,
'
Alice
said
,
`
if
it
makes
you
so
unhappy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
another
of
those
melancholy
little
sighs
,
and
this
time
the
*NL*
poor
Gnat
really
seemed
to
have
sighed
itself
away
,
for
,
when
Alice
*NL*
looked
up
,
there
was
nothing
whatever
to
be
seen
on
the
twig
,
and
,
as
*NL*
she
was
getting
quite
chilly
with
sitting
still
so
long
,
she
got
up
and
*NL*
walked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
very
soon
came
to
an
open
field
,
with
a
wood
on
the
other
side
of
*NL*
it
:
it
looked
much
darker
than
the
last
wood
,
and
Alice
felt
a
LITTLE
*NL*
timid
about
going
into
it
.
However
,
on
second
thoughts
,
she
made
up
her
*NL*
mind
to
go
on
:
`
for
I
certainly
wo
n't
go
BACK
,
'
she
thought
to
herself
,
*NL*
and
this
was
the
only
way
to
the
Eighth
Square
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
must
be
the
wood
,
'
she
said
thoughtfully
to
herself
,
`
where
*NL*
things
have
no
names
.
I
wonder
what
'll
become
of
MY
name
when
I
go
in
?
*NL*
I
should
n't
like
to
lose
it
at
all
--
because
they
'd
have
to
give
me
*NL*
another
,
and
it
would
be
almost
certain
to
be
an
ugly
one
.
But
then
*NL*
the
fun
would
be
trying
to
find
the
creature
that
had
got
my
old
*NL*
name
!
That
's
just
like
the
advertisements
,
you
know
,
when
people
lose
*NL*
dogs
--
``
ANSWERS
TO
THE
NAME
OF
`
DASH
:
'
HAD
ON
A
BRASS
COLLAR
''
--
just
fancy
*NL*
calling
everything
you
met
``
Alice
,
''
till
one
of
them
answered
!
Only
they
*NL*
would
n't
answer
at
all
,
if
they
were
wise
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
rambling
on
in
this
way
when
she
reached
the
wood
:
it
looked
*NL*
very
cool
and
shady
.
`
Well
,
at
any
rate
it
's
a
great
comfort
,
'
she
*NL*
said
as
she
stepped
under
the
trees
,
`
after
being
so
hot
,
to
get
into
*NL*
the
--
into
WHAT
?
'
she
went
on
,
rather
surprised
at
not
being
able
to
*NL*
think
of
the
word
.
'
I
mean
to
get
under
the
--
under
the
--
under
THIS
,
you
*NL*
know
!
'
putting
her
hand
on
the
trunk
of
the
tree
.
`
What
DOES
it
call
*NL*
itself
,
I
wonder
?
I
do
believe
it
's
got
no
name
--
why
,
to
be
sure
it
*NL*
has
n't
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
silent
for
a
minute
,
thinking
:
then
she
suddenly
began
again
.
*NL*
`
Then
it
really
HAS
happened
,
after
all
!
And
now
,
who
am
I
?
I
WILL
*NL*
remember
,
if
I
can
!
I
'm
determined
to
do
it
!
'
But
being
determined
*NL*
did
n't
help
much
,
and
all
she
could
say
,
after
a
great
deal
of
puzzling
,
*NL*
was
,
`
L
,
I
KNOW
it
begins
with
L
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
a
Fawn
came
wandering
by
:
it
looked
at
Alice
with
its
large
*NL*
gentle
eyes
,
but
did
n't
seem
at
all
frightened
.
`
Here
then
!
Here
then
!
'
*NL*
Alice
said
,
as
she
held
out
her
hand
and
tried
to
stroke
it
;
but
it
only
*NL*
started
back
a
little
,
and
then
stood
looking
at
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
do
you
call
yourself
?
'
the
Fawn
said
at
last
.
Such
a
soft
sweet
*NL*
voice
it
had
!
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
I
knew
!
'
thought
poor
Alice
.
She
answered
,
rather
sadly
,
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
just
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Think
again
,
'
it
said
:
`
that
wo
n't
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
thought
,
but
nothing
came
of
it
.
`
Please
,
would
you
tell
me
*NL*
what
YOU
call
yourself
?
'
she
said
timidly
.
'
I
think
that
might
help
a
*NL*
little
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
you
,
if
you
'll
move
a
little
further
on
,
'
the
Fawn
said
.
'
I
*NL*
ca
n't
remember
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
walked
on
together
though
the
wood
,
Alice
with
her
arms
clasped
*NL*
lovingly
round
the
soft
neck
of
the
Fawn
,
till
they
came
out
into
*NL*
another
open
field
,
and
here
the
Fawn
gave
a
sudden
bound
into
the
air
,
*NL*
and
shook
itself
free
from
Alice
's
arms
.
`
I
'm
a
Fawn
!
'
it
cried
out
in
a
*NL*
voice
of
delight
,
`
and
,
dear
me
!
you
're
a
human
child
!
'
A
sudden
look
of
*NL*
alarm
came
into
its
beautiful
brown
eyes
,
and
in
another
moment
it
had
*NL*
darted
away
at
full
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
stood
looking
after
it
,
almost
ready
to
cry
with
vexation
at
*NL*
having
lost
her
dear
little
fellow-traveller
so
suddenly
.
`
However
,
I
*NL*
know
my
name
now
.
'
she
said
,
`
that
's
SOME
comfort
.
Alice
--
Alice
--
I
wo
n't
*NL*
forget
it
again
.
And
now
,
which
of
these
finger-posts
ought
I
to
follow
,
*NL*
I
wonder
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer
,
as
there
was
only
one
*NL*
road
through
the
wood
,
and
the
two
finger-posts
both
pointed
along
it
.
*NL*
`
I
'll
settle
it
,
'
Alice
said
to
herself
,
`
when
the
road
divides
and
they
*NL*
point
different
ways
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
did
not
seem
likely
to
happen
.
She
went
on
and
on
,
a
long
way
,
*NL*
but
wherever
the
road
divided
there
were
sure
to
be
two
finger-posts
*NL*
pointing
the
same
way
,
one
marked
`
TO
TWEEDLEDUM
'S
HOUSE
'
and
the
other
*NL*
`
TO
THE
HOUSE
OF
TWEEDLEDEE
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
believe
,
'
said
Alice
at
last
,
`
that
they
live
in
the
same
house
!
I
*NL*
wonder
I
never
thought
of
that
before
--
But
I
ca
n't
stay
there
long
.
I
'll
*NL*
just
call
and
say
``
how
d'you
do
?
''
and
ask
them
the
way
out
of
the
wood
.
*NL*
If
I
could
only
get
to
the
Eighth
Square
before
it
gets
dark
!
'
So
she
*NL*
wandered
on
,
talking
to
herself
as
she
went
,
till
,
on
turning
a
sharp
*NL*
corner
,
she
came
upon
two
fat
little
men
,
so
suddenly
that
she
could
not
*NL*
help
starting
back
,
but
in
another
moment
she

*NL*

that
they

CHAPTER
IV
.
Tweedledum
And
Tweedledee
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
standing
under
a
tree
,
each
with
an
arm
round
the
other
's
*NL*
neck
,
and
Alice
knew
which
was
which
in
a
moment
,
because
one
of
them
*NL*
had
`
DUM
'
embroidered
on
his
collar
,
and
the
other
`
DEE
.
'
'
I
suppose
*NL*
they
've
each
got
``
TWEEDLE
''
round
at
the
back
of
the
collar
,
'
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
so
still
that
she
quite
forgot
they
were
alive
,
and
she
was
*NL*
just
looking
round
to
see
if
the
word
``
TWEEDLE
''
was
written
at
the
back
*NL*
of
each
collar
,
when
she
was
startled
by
a
voice
coming
from
the
one
*NL*
marked
`
DUM
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
think
we
're
wax-works
,
'
he
said
,
`
you
ought
to
pay
,
you
know
.
*NL*
Wax-works
were
n't
made
to
be
looked
at
for
nothing
,
nohow
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Contrariwise
,
'
added
the
one
marked
`
DEE
,
'
`
if
you
think
we
're
alive
,
*NL*
you
ought
to
speak
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
sure
I
'm
very
sorry
,
'
was
all
Alice
could
say
;
for
the
words
of
the
*NL*
old
song
kept
ringing
through
her
head
like
the
ticking
of
a
clock
,
and
*NL*
she
could
hardly
help
saying
them
out
loud
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tweedledum
and
Tweedledee
*NL*
Agreed
to
have
a
battle
;
*NL*
For
Tweedledum
said
Tweedledee
*NL*
Had
spoiled
his
nice
new
rattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
flew
down
a
monstrous
crow
,
*NL*
As
black
as
a
tar-barrel
;
*NL*
Which
frightened
both
the
heroes
so
,
*NL*
They
quite
forgot
their
quarrel
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
what
you
're
thinking
about
,
'
said
Tweedledum
:
`
but
it
is
n't
so
,
*NL*
nohow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Contrariwise
,
'
continued
Tweedledee
,
`
if
it
was
so
,
it
might
be
;
and
if
*NL*
it
were
so
,
it
would
be
;
but
as
it
is
n't
,
it
ai
n't
.
That
's
logic
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
thinking
,
'
Alice
said
very
politely
,
`
which
is
the
best
way
out
*NL*
of
this
wood
:
it
's
getting
so
dark
.
Would
you
tell
me
,
please
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
little
men
only
looked
at
each
other
and
grinned
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
so
exactly
like
a
couple
of
great
schoolboys
,
that
Alice
*NL*
could
n't
help
pointing
her
finger
at
Tweedledum
,
and
saying
`
First
Boy
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nohow
!
'
Tweedledum
cried
out
briskly
,
and
shut
his
mouth
up
again
with
*NL*
a
snap
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Next
Boy
!
'
said
Alice
,
passing
on
to
Tweedledee
,
though
she
felt
quite
*NL*
certain
he
would
only
shout
out
`
Contrariwise
!
'
and
so
he
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
've
been
wrong
!
'
cried
Tweedledum
.
`
The
first
thing
in
a
visit
is
to
*NL*
say
``
How
d'ye
do
?
''
and
shake
hands
!
'
And
here
the
two
brothers
gave
each
*NL*
other
a
hug
,
and
then
they
held
out
the
two
hands
that
were
free
,
to
*NL*
shake
hands
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
did
not
like
shaking
hands
with
either
of
them
first
,
for
fear
*NL*
of
hurting
the
other
one
's
feelings
;
so
,
as
the
best
way
out
of
the
*NL*
difficulty
,
she
took
hold
of
both
hands
at
once
:
the
next
moment
they
*NL*
were
dancing
round
in
a
ring
.
This
seemed
quite
natural
-LRB-
she
remembered
*NL*
afterwards
-RRB-
,
and
she
was
not
even
surprised
to
hear
music
playing
:
it
*NL*
seemed
to
come
from
the
tree
under
which
they
were
dancing
,
and
it
was
*NL*
done
-LRB-
as
well
as
she
could
make
it
out
-RRB-
by
the
branches
rubbing
one
*NL*
across
the
other
,
like
fiddles
and
fiddle-sticks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
it
certainly
WAS
funny
,
'
-LRB-
Alice
said
afterwards
,
when
she
was
*NL*
telling
her
sister
the
history
of
all
this
,
-RRB-
`
to
find
myself
singing
*NL*
``
HERE
WE
GO
ROUND
THE
MULBERRY
BUSH
.
''
I
do
n't
know
when
I
began
it
,
but
*NL*
somehow
I
felt
as
if
I
'd
been
singing
it
a
long
long
time
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
two
dancers
were
fat
,
and
very
soon
out
of
breath
.
`
Four
times
*NL*
round
is
enough
for
one
dance
,
'
Tweedledum
panted
out
,
and
they
left
*NL*
off
dancing
as
suddenly
as
they
had
begun
:
the
music
stopped
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
let
go
of
Alice
's
hands
,
and
stood
looking
at
her
for
a
*NL*
minute
:
there
was
a
rather
awkward
pause
,
as
Alice
did
n't
know
how
to
*NL*
begin
a
conversation
with
people
she
had
just
been
dancing
with
.
`
It
*NL*
would
never
do
to
say
``
How
d'ye
do
?
''
NOW
,
'
she
said
to
herself
:
`
we
seem
*NL*
to
have
got
beyond
that
,
somehow
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
you
're
not
much
tired
?
'
she
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nohow
.
And
thank
you
VERY
much
for
asking
,
'
said
Tweedledum
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
much
obliged
!
'
added
Tweedledee
.
`
You
like
poetry
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ye-es
,
pretty
well
--
SOME
poetry
,
'
Alice
said
doubtfully
.
`
Would
you
*NL*
tell
me
which
road
leads
out
of
the
wood
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
shall
I
repeat
to
her
?
'
said
Tweedledee
,
looking
round
at
*NL*
Tweedledum
with
great
solemn
eyes
,
and
not
noticing
Alice
's
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
THE
WALRUS
AND
THE
CARPENTER
''
is
the
longest
,
'
Tweedledum
replied
,
*NL*
giving
his
brother
an
affectionate
hug
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tweedledee
began
instantly
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
sun
was
shining
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Alice
ventured
to
interrupt
him
.
`
If
it
's
VERY
long
,
'
she
said
,
as
*NL*
politely
as
she
could
,
`
would
you
please
tell
me
first
which
road
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Tweedledee
smiled
gently
,
and
began
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
sun
was
shining
on
the
sea
,
*NL*
Shining
with
all
his
might
:
*NL*
He
did
his
very
best
to
make
*NL*
The
billows
smooth
and
bright
--
*NL*
And
this
was
odd
,
because
it
was
*NL*
The
middle
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
was
shining
sulkily
,
*NL*
Because
she
thought
the
sun
*NL*
Had
got
no
business
to
be
there
*NL*
After
the
day
was
done
--
*NL*
``
It
's
very
rude
of
him
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
To
come
and
spoil
the
fun
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sea
was
wet
as
wet
could
be
,
*NL*
The
sands
were
dry
as
dry
.
*NL*
You
could
not
see
a
cloud
,
because
*NL*
No
cloud
was
in
the
sky
:
*NL*
No
birds
were
flying
over
head
--
*NL*
There
were
no
birds
to
fly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Walrus
and
the
Carpenter
*NL*
Were
walking
close
at
hand
;
*NL*
They
wept
like
anything
to
see
*NL*
Such
quantities
of
sand
:
*NL*
``
If
this
were
only
cleared
away
,
''
*NL*
They
said
,
``
it
WOULD
be
grand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
seven
maids
with
seven
mops
*NL*
Swept
it
for
half
a
year
,
*NL*
Do
you
suppose
,
''
the
Walrus
said
,
*NL*
``
That
they
could
get
it
clear
?
''
*NL*
``
I
doubt
it
,
''
said
the
Carpenter
,
*NL*
And
shed
a
bitter
tear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Oysters
,
come
and
walk
with
us
!
''
*NL*
The
Walrus
did
beseech
.
*NL*
``
A
pleasant
walk
,
a
pleasant
talk
,
*NL*
Along
the
briny
beach
:
*NL*
We
can
not
do
with
more
than
four
,
*NL*
To
give
a
hand
to
each
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eldest
Oyster
looked
at
him
.
*NL*
But
never
a
word
he
said
:
*NL*
The
eldest
Oyster
winked
his
eye
,
*NL*
And
shook
his
heavy
head
--
*NL*
Meaning
to
say
he
did
not
choose
*NL*
To
leave
the
oyster-bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
four
young
oysters
hurried
up
,
*NL*
All
eager
for
the
treat
:
*NL*
Their
coats
were
brushed
,
their
faces
washed
,
*NL*
Their
shoes
were
clean
and
neat
--
*NL*
And
this
was
odd
,
because
,
you
know
,
*NL*
They
had
n't
any
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
other
Oysters
followed
them
,
*NL*
And
yet
another
four
;
*NL*
And
thick
and
fast
they
came
at
last
,
*NL*
And
more
,
and
more
,
and
more
--
*NL*
All
hopping
through
the
frothy
waves
,
*NL*
And
scrambling
to
the
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Walrus
and
the
Carpenter
*NL*
Walked
on
a
mile
or
so
,
*NL*
And
then
they
rested
on
a
rock
*NL*
Conveniently
low
:
*NL*
And
all
the
little
Oysters
stood
*NL*
And
waited
in
a
row
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
has
come
,
''
the
Walrus
said
,
*NL*
``
To
talk
of
many
things
:
*NL*
Of
shoes
--
and
ships
--
and
sealing-wax
--
*NL*
Of
cabbages
--
and
kings
--
*NL*
And
why
the
sea
is
boiling
hot
--
*NL*
And
whether
pigs
have
wings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
wait
a
bit
,
''
the
Oysters
cried
,
*NL*
``
Before
we
have
our
chat
;
*NL*
For
some
of
us
are
out
of
breath
,
*NL*
And
all
of
us
are
fat
!
''
*NL*
``
No
hurry
!
''
said
the
Carpenter
.
*NL*
They
thanked
him
much
for
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
loaf
of
bread
,
''
the
Walrus
said
,
*NL*
``
Is
what
we
chiefly
need
:
*NL*
Pepper
and
vinegar
besides
*NL*
Are
very
good
indeed
--
*NL*
Now
if
you
're
ready
Oysters
dear
,
*NL*
We
can
begin
to
feed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
not
on
us
!
''
the
Oysters
cried
,
*NL*
Turning
a
little
blue
,
*NL*
``
After
such
kindness
,
that
would
be
*NL*
A
dismal
thing
to
do
!
''
*NL*
``
The
night
is
fine
,
''
the
Walrus
said
*NL*
``
Do
you
admire
the
view
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
so
kind
of
you
to
come
!
*NL*
And
you
are
very
nice
!
''
*NL*
The
Carpenter
said
nothing
but
*NL*
``
Cut
us
another
slice
:
*NL*
I
wish
you
were
not
quite
so
deaf
--
*NL*
I
've
had
to
ask
you
twice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
a
shame
,
''
the
Walrus
said
,
*NL*
``
To
play
them
such
a
trick
,
*NL*
After
we
've
brought
them
out
so
far
,
*NL*
And
made
them
trot
so
quick
!
''
*NL*
The
Carpenter
said
nothing
but
*NL*
``
The
butter
's
spread
too
thick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
weep
for
you
,
''
the
Walrus
said
.
*NL*
``
I
deeply
sympathize
.
''
*NL*
With
sobs
and
tears
he
sorted
out
*NL*
Those
of
the
largest
size
.
*NL*
Holding
his
pocket
handkerchief
*NL*
Before
his
streaming
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Oysters
,
''
said
the
Carpenter
.
*NL*
``
You
've
had
a
pleasant
run
!
*NL*
Shall
we
be
trotting
home
again
?
''
*NL*
But
answer
came
there
none
--
*NL*
And
that
was
scarcely
odd
,
because
*NL*
They
'd
eaten
every
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
like
the
Walrus
best
,
'
said
Alice
:
`
because
you
see
he
was
a
LITTLE
*NL*
sorry
for
the
poor
oysters
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
ate
more
than
the
Carpenter
,
though
,
'
said
Tweedledee
.
`
You
see
he
*NL*
held
his
handkerchief
in
front
,
so
that
the
Carpenter
could
n't
count
how
*NL*
many
he
took
:
contrariwise
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
was
mean
!
'
Alice
said
indignantly
.
`
Then
I
like
the
Carpenter
*NL*
best
--
if
he
did
n't
eat
so
many
as
the
Walrus
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
he
ate
as
many
as
he
could
get
,
'
said
Tweedledum
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
puzzler
.
After
a
pause
,
Alice
began
,
`
Well
!
They
were
BOTH
*NL*
very
unpleasant
characters
--
'
Here
she
checked
herself
in
some
alarm
,
*NL*
at
hearing
something
that
sounded
to
her
like
the
puffing
of
a
large
*NL*
steam-engine
in
the
wood
near
them
,
though
she
feared
it
was
more
likely
*NL*
to
be
a
wild
beast
.
`
Are
there
any
lions
or
tigers
about
here
?
'
she
*NL*
asked
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
only
the
Red
King
snoring
,
'
said
Tweedledee
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
and
look
at
him
!
'
the
brothers
cried
,
and
they
each
took
one
of
*NL*
Alice
's
hands
,
and
led
her
up
to
where
the
King
was
sleeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
n't
he
a
LOVELY
sight
?
'
said
Tweedledum
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
could
n't
say
honestly
that
he
was
.
He
had
a
tall
red
night-cap
on
,
*NL*
with
a
tassel
,
and
he
was
lying
crumpled
up
into
a
sort
of
untidy
heap
,
*NL*
and
snoring
loud
--
`
fit
to
snore
his
head
off
!
'
as
Tweedledum
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
afraid
he
'll
catch
cold
with
lying
on
the
damp
grass
,
'
said
Alice
,
*NL*
who
was
a
very
thoughtful
little
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
dreaming
now
,
'
said
Tweedledee
:
`
and
what
do
you
think
he
's
*NL*
dreaming
about
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
said
`
Nobody
can
guess
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
about
YOU
!
'
Tweedledee
exclaimed
,
clapping
his
hands
triumphantly
.
*NL*
`
And
if
he
left
off
dreaming
about
you
,
where
do
you
suppose
you
'd
be
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
I
am
now
,
of
course
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
you
!
'
Tweedledee
retorted
contemptuously
.
`
You
'd
be
nowhere
.
Why
,
*NL*
you
're
only
a
sort
of
thing
in
his
dream
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
that
there
King
was
to
wake
,
'
added
Tweedledum
,
`
you
'd
go
*NL*
out
--
bang
!
--
just
like
a
candle
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
n't
!
'
Alice
exclaimed
indignantly
.
`
Besides
,
if
I
'M
only
a
sort
*NL*
of
thing
in
his
dream
,
what
are
YOU
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ditto
'
said
Tweedledum
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ditto
,
ditto
'
cried
Tweedledee
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shouted
this
so
loud
that
Alice
could
n't
help
saying
,
`
Hush
!
You
'll
*NL*
be
waking
him
,
I
'm
afraid
,
if
you
make
so
much
noise
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
it
no
use
YOUR
talking
about
waking
him
,
'
said
Tweedledum
,
`
when
*NL*
you
're
only
one
of
the
things
in
his
dream
.
You
know
very
well
you
're
*NL*
not
real
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
AM
real
!
'
said
Alice
and
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
wo
n't
make
yourself
a
bit
realler
by
crying
,
'
Tweedledee
remarked
:
*NL*
`
there
's
nothing
to
cry
about
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
was
n't
real
,
'
Alice
said
--
half-laughing
through
her
tears
,
it
all
*NL*
seemed
so
ridiculous
--
'
I
should
n't
be
able
to
cry
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
you
do
n't
suppose
those
are
real
tears
?
'
Tweedledum
interrupted
*NL*
in
a
tone
of
great
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
they
're
talking
nonsense
,
'
Alice
thought
to
herself
:
`
and
it
's
*NL*
foolish
to
cry
about
it
.
'
So
she
brushed
away
her
tears
,
and
went
on
as
*NL*
cheerfully
as
she
could
.
`
At
any
rate
I
'd
better
be
getting
out
of
the
*NL*
wood
,
for
really
it
's
coming
on
very
dark
.
Do
you
think
it
's
going
to
*NL*
rain
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Tweedledum
spread
a
large
umbrella
over
himself
and
his
brother
,
and
*NL*
looked
up
into
it
.
`
No
,
I
do
n't
think
it
is
,
'
he
said
:
`
at
least
--
not
*NL*
under
HERE
.
Nohow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
it
may
rain
OUTSIDE
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
may
--
if
it
chooses
,
'
said
Tweedledee
:
`
we
've
no
objection
.
*NL*
Contrariwise
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Selfish
things
!
'
thought
Alice
,
and
she
was
just
going
to
say
*NL*
`
Good-night
'
and
leave
them
,
when
Tweedledum
sprang
out
from
under
the
*NL*
umbrella
and
seized
her
by
the
wrist
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
see
THAT
?
'
he
said
,
in
a
voice
choking
with
passion
,
and
*NL*
his
eyes
grew
large
and
yellow
all
in
a
moment
,
as
he
pointed
with
a
*NL*
trembling
finger
at
a
small
white
thing
lying
under
the
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
only
a
rattle
,
'
Alice
said
,
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
*NL*
little
white
thing
.
`
Not
a
rattleSNAKE
,
you
know
,
'
she
added
hastily
,
*NL*
thinking
that
he
was
frightened
:
`
only
an
old
rattle
--
quite
old
and
*NL*
broken
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
knew
it
was
!
'
cried
Tweedledum
,
beginning
to
stamp
about
wildly
and
*NL*
tear
his
hair
.
`
It
's
spoilt
,
of
course
!
'
Here
he
looked
at
Tweedledee
,
*NL*
who
immediately
sat
down
on
the
ground
,
and
tried
to
hide
himself
under
*NL*
the
umbrella
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
and
said
in
a
soothing
tone
,
`
You
*NL*
need
n't
be
so
angry
about
an
old
rattle
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
it
is
n't
old
!
'
Tweedledum
cried
,
in
a
greater
fury
than
ever
.
`
It
's
*NL*
new
,
I
tell
you
--
I
bought
it
yesterday
--
my
nice
new
RATTLE
!
'
and
his
*NL*
voice
rose
to
a
perfect
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
Tweedledee
was
trying
his
best
to
fold
up
the
umbrella
,
*NL*
with
himself
in
it
:
which
was
such
an
extraordinary
thing
to
do
,
that
it
*NL*
quite
took
off
Alice
's
attention
from
the
angry
brother
.
But
he
could
n't
*NL*
quite
succeed
,
and
it
ended
in
his
rolling
over
,
bundled
up
in
the
*NL*
umbrella
,
with
only
his
head
out
:
and
there
he
lay
,
opening
and
shutting
*NL*
his
mouth
and
his
large
eyes
--
`
looking
more
like
a
fish
than
anything
*NL*
else
,
'
Alice
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
you
agree
to
have
a
battle
?
'
Tweedledum
said
in
a
calmer
*NL*
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
so
,
'
the
other
sulkily
replied
,
as
he
crawled
out
of
the
*NL*
umbrella
:
`
only
SHE
must
help
us
to
dress
up
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
two
brothers
went
off
hand-in-hand
into
the
wood
,
and
returned
*NL*
in
a
minute
with
their
arms
full
of
things
--
such
as
bolsters
,
blankets
,
*NL*
hearth-rugs
,
table-cloths
,
dish-covers
and
coal-scuttles
.
'
I
hope
you
're
*NL*
a
good
hand
at
pinning
and
tying
strings
?
'
Tweedledum
remarked
.
`
Every
*NL*
one
of
these
things
has
got
to
go
on
,
somehow
or
other
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
said
afterwards
she
had
never
seen
such
a
fuss
made
about
anything
*NL*
in
all
her
life
--
the
way
those
two
bustled
about
--
and
the
quantity
of
*NL*
things
they
put
on
--
and
the
trouble
they
gave
her
in
tying
strings
and
*NL*
fastening
buttons
--
`
Really
they
'll
be
more
like
bundles
of
old
clothes
*NL*
than
anything
else
,
by
the
time
they
're
ready
!
'
she
said
to
herself
,
as
*NL*
she
arranged
a
bolster
round
the
neck
of
Tweedledee
,
`
to
keep
his
head
*NL*
from
being
cut
off
,
'
as
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
know
,
'
he
added
very
gravely
,
`
it
's
one
of
the
most
serious
things
*NL*
that
can
possibly
happen
to
one
in
a
battle
--
to
get
one
's
head
cut
off
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
laughed
aloud
:
but
she
managed
to
turn
it
into
a
cough
,
for
fear
*NL*
of
hurting
his
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
I
look
very
pale
?
'
said
Tweedledum
,
coming
up
to
have
his
helmet
*NL*
tied
on
.
-LRB-
He
CALLED
it
a
helmet
,
though
it
certainly
looked
much
more
*NL*
like
a
saucepan
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
--
yes
--
a
LITTLE
,
'
Alice
replied
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
very
brave
generally
,
'
he
went
on
in
a
low
voice
:
`
only
to-day
I
*NL*
happen
to
have
a
headache
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
I
'VE
got
a
toothache
!
'
said
Tweedledee
,
who
had
overheard
the
*NL*
remark
.
`
I
'm
far
worse
off
than
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
you
'd
better
not
fight
to-day
,
'
said
Alice
,
thinking
it
a
good
*NL*
opportunity
to
make
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
MUST
have
a
bit
of
a
fight
,
but
I
do
n't
care
about
going
on
long
,
'
*NL*
said
Tweedledum
.
`
What
's
the
time
now
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Tweedledee
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
said
`
Half-past
four
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
's
fight
till
six
,
and
then
have
dinner
,
'
said
Tweedledum
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
well
,
'
the
other
said
,
rather
sadly
:
`
and
SHE
can
watch
us
--
only
*NL*
you
'd
better
not
come
VERY
close
,
'
he
added
:
'
I
generally
hit
everything
*NL*
I
can
see
--
when
I
get
really
excited
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
_
I
_
hit
everything
within
reach
,
'
cried
Tweedledum
,
`
whether
I
can
*NL*
see
it
or
not
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
laughed
.
`
You
must
hit
the
TREES
pretty
often
,
I
should
think
,
'
*NL*
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tweedledum
looked
round
him
with
a
satisfied
smile
.
'
I
do
n't
suppose
,
'
*NL*
he
said
,
`
there
'll
be
a
tree
left
standing
,
for
ever
so
far
round
,
by
*NL*
the
time
we
've
finished
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
all
about
a
rattle
!
'
said
Alice
,
still
hoping
to
make
them
a
LITTLE
*NL*
ashamed
of
fighting
for
such
a
trifle
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
n't
have
minded
it
so
much
,
'
said
Tweedledum
,
`
if
it
had
n't
*NL*
been
a
new
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
the
monstrous
crow
would
come
!
'
thought
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
only
one
sword
,
you
know
,
'
Tweedledum
said
to
his
brother
:
*NL*
`
but
you
can
have
the
umbrella
--
it
's
quite
as
sharp
.
Only
we
must
begin
*NL*
quick
.
It
's
getting
as
dark
as
it
can
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
darker
,
'
said
Tweedledee
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
getting
dark
so
suddenly
that
Alice
thought
there
must
be
a
*NL*
thunderstorm
coming
on
.
`
What
a
thick
black
cloud
that
is
!
'
she
said
.
*NL*
`
And
how
fast
it
comes
!
Why
,
I
do
believe
it
's
got
wings
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
the
crow
!
'
Tweedledum
cried
out
in
a
shrill
voice
of
alarm
:
and
*NL*
the
two
brothers
took
to
their
heels
and
were
out
of
sight
in
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
ran
a
little
way
into
the
wood
,
and
stopped
under
a
large
tree
.
*NL*
`
It
can
never
get
at
me
HERE
,
'
she
thought
:
`
it
's
far
too
large
to
*NL*
squeeze
itself
in
among
the
trees
.
But
I
wish
it
would
n't
flap
its
wings
*NL*
so
--
it
makes
quite
a
hurricane
in
the
wood
--
here
's
somebody
's
shawl
*NL*
being
blown
away
!

*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
V.
Wool
and
Water
*NL*
*NL*
She
caught
the
shawl
as
she
spoke
,
and
looked
about
for
the
owner
:
in
*NL*
another
moment
the
White
Queen
came
running
wildly
through
the
wood
,
*NL*
with
both
arms
stretched
out
wide
,
as
if
she
were
flying
,
and
Alice
very
*NL*
civilly
went
to
meet
her
with
the
shawl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
very
glad
I
happened
to
be
in
the
way
,
'
Alice
said
,
as
she
helped
*NL*
her
to
put
on
her
shawl
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
White
Queen
only
looked
at
her
in
a
helpless
frightened
sort
of
way
,
*NL*
and
kept
repeating
something
in
a
whisper
to
herself
that
sounded
like
*NL*
`
bread-and-butter
,
bread-and-butter
,
'
and
Alice
felt
that
if
there
was
*NL*
to
be
any
conversation
at
all
,
she
must
manage
it
herself
.
So
she
began
*NL*
rather
timidly
:
`
Am
I
addressing
the
White
Queen
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
yes
,
if
you
call
that
a-dressing
,
'
The
Queen
said
.
`
It
is
n't
MY
*NL*
notion
of
the
thing
,
at
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
thought
it
would
never
do
to
have
an
argument
at
the
very
*NL*
beginning
of
their
conversation
,
so
she
smiled
and
said
,
`
If
your
*NL*
Majesty
will
only
tell
me
the
right
way
to
begin
,
I
'll
do
it
as
well
as
*NL*
I
can
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
do
n't
want
it
done
at
all
!
'
groaned
the
poor
Queen
.
`
I
've
been
*NL*
a-dressing
myself
for
the
last
two
hours
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
all
the
better
,
as
it
seemed
to
Alice
,
if
she
had
got
*NL*
some
one
else
to
dress
her
,
she
was
so
dreadfully
untidy
.
`
Every
*NL*
single
thing
's
crooked
,
'
Alice
thought
to
herself
,
`
and
she
's
all
over
*NL*
pins
!
--
may
I
put
your
shawl
straight
for
you
?
'
she
added
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
's
the
matter
with
it
!
'
the
Queen
said
,
in
a
*NL*
melancholy
voice
.
`
It
's
out
of
temper
,
I
think
.
I
've
pinned
it
here
,
and
*NL*
I
've
pinned
it
there
,
but
there
's
no
pleasing
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
CA
N'T
go
straight
,
you
know
,
if
you
pin
it
all
on
one
side
,
'
Alice
*NL*
said
,
as
she
gently
put
it
right
for
her
;
`
and
,
dear
me
,
what
a
state
*NL*
your
hair
is
in
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
brush
has
got
entangled
in
it
!
'
the
Queen
said
with
a
sigh
.
`
And
I
*NL*
lost
the
comb
yesterday
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
carefully
released
the
brush
,
and
did
her
best
to
get
the
hair
*NL*
into
order
.
`
Come
,
you
look
rather
better
now
!
'
she
said
,
after
altering
*NL*
most
of
the
pins
.
`
But
really
you
should
have
a
lady
's
maid
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
sure
I
'll
take
you
with
pleasure
!
'
the
Queen
said
.
`
Twopence
a
*NL*
week
,
and
jam
every
other
day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
could
n't
help
laughing
,
as
she
said
,
'
I
do
n't
want
you
to
hire
*NL*
ME
--
and
I
do
n't
care
for
jam
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
very
good
jam
,
'
said
the
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
I
do
n't
want
any
TO-DAY
,
at
any
rate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
could
n't
have
it
if
you
DID
want
it
,
'
the
Queen
said
.
`
The
rule
is
,
*NL*
jam
to-morrow
and
jam
yesterday
--
but
never
jam
to-day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
MUST
come
sometimes
to
``
jam
to-day
,
''
'
Alice
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
it
ca
n't
,
'
said
the
Queen
.
`
It
's
jam
every
OTHER
day
:
to-day
is
n't
*NL*
any
OTHER
day
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
'
said
Alice
.
`
It
's
dreadfully
confusing
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
the
effect
of
living
backwards
,
'
the
Queen
said
kindly
:
`
it
*NL*
always
makes
one
a
little
giddy
at
first
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Living
backwards
!
'
Alice
repeated
in
great
astonishment
.
'
I
never
heard
*NL*
of
such
a
thing
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
but
there
's
one
great
advantage
in
it
,
that
one
's
memory
works
both
*NL*
ways
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
sure
MINE
only
works
one
way
,
'
Alice
remarked
.
'
I
ca
n't
remember
*NL*
things
before
they
happen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
poor
sort
of
memory
that
only
works
backwards
,
'
the
Queen
*NL*
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
sort
of
things
do
YOU
remember
best
?
'
Alice
ventured
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
things
that
happened
the
week
after
next
,
'
the
Queen
replied
in
a
*NL*
careless
tone
.
`
For
instance
,
now
,
'
she
went
on
,
sticking
a
large
piece
*NL*
of
plaster
-LSB-
band-aid
-RSB-
on
her
finger
as
she
spoke
,
`
there
's
the
King
's
*NL*
Messenger
.
He
's
in
prison
now
,
being
punished
:
and
the
trial
does
n't
*NL*
even
begin
till
next
Wednesday
:
and
of
course
the
crime
comes
last
of
*NL*
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suppose
he
never
commits
the
crime
?
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
would
be
all
the
better
,
would
n't
it
?
'
the
Queen
said
,
as
she
*NL*
bound
the
plaster
round
her
finger
with
a
bit
of
ribbon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
felt
there
was
no
denying
THAT
.
`
Of
course
it
would
be
all
*NL*
the
better
,
'
she
said
:
`
but
it
would
n't
be
all
the
better
his
being
*NL*
punished
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
wrong
THERE
,
at
any
rate
,
'
said
the
Queen
:
`
were
YOU
ever
*NL*
punished
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
for
faults
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
were
all
the
better
for
it
,
I
know
!
'
the
Queen
said
*NL*
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
but
then
I
HAD
done
the
things
I
was
punished
for
,
'
said
Alice
:
*NL*
`
that
makes
all
the
difference
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
if
you
HAD
N'T
done
them
,
'
the
Queen
said
,
`
that
would
have
been
*NL*
better
still
;
better
,
and
better
,
and
better
!
'
Her
voice
went
higher
*NL*
with
each
`
better
,
'
till
it
got
quite
to
a
squeak
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
was
just
beginning
to
say
`
There
's
a
mistake
somewhere
--
,
'
when
*NL*
the
Queen
began
screaming
so
loud
that
she
had
to
leave
the
sentence
*NL*
unfinished
.
`
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
'
shouted
the
Queen
,
shaking
her
hand
about
as
*NL*
if
she
wanted
to
shake
it
off
.
`
My
finger
's
bleeding
!
Oh
,
oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Her
screams
were
so
exactly
like
the
whistle
of
a
steam-engine
,
that
*NL*
Alice
had
to
hold
both
her
hands
over
her
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
IS
the
matter
?
'
she
said
,
as
soon
as
there
was
a
chance
of
making
*NL*
herself
heard
.
`
Have
you
pricked
your
finger
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
n't
pricked
it
YET
,
'
the
Queen
said
,
`
but
I
soon
shall
--
oh
,
oh
,
*NL*
oh
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
do
you
expect
to
do
it
?
'
Alice
asked
,
feeling
very
much
inclined
*NL*
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
I
fasten
my
shawl
again
,
'
the
poor
Queen
groaned
out
:
`
the
brooch
*NL*
will
come
undone
directly
.
Oh
,
oh
!
'
As
she
said
the
words
the
brooch
*NL*
flew
open
,
and
the
Queen
clutched
wildly
at
it
,
and
tried
to
clasp
it
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
care
!
'
cried
Alice
.
`
You
're
holding
it
all
crooked
!
'
And
she
*NL*
caught
at
the
brooch
;
but
it
was
too
late
:
the
pin
had
slipped
,
and
the
*NL*
Queen
had
pricked
her
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
accounts
for
the
bleeding
,
you
see
,
'
she
said
to
Alice
with
a
*NL*
smile
.
`
Now
you
understand
the
way
things
happen
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
why
do
n't
you
scream
now
?
'
Alice
asked
,
holding
her
hands
ready
to
*NL*
put
over
her
ears
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
I
've
done
all
the
screaming
already
,
'
said
the
Queen
.
`
What
would
*NL*
be
the
good
of
having
it
all
over
again
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
it
was
getting
light
.
`
The
crow
must
have
flown
away
,
I
*NL*
think
,
'
said
Alice
:
`
I
'm
so
glad
it
's
gone
.
I
thought
it
was
the
night
*NL*
coming
on
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
_
I
_
could
manage
to
be
glad
!
'
the
Queen
said
.
`
Only
I
never
*NL*
can
remember
the
rule
.
You
must
be
very
happy
,
living
in
this
wood
,
and
*NL*
being
glad
whenever
you
like
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
it
is
so
VERY
lonely
here
!
'
Alice
said
in
a
melancholy
voice
;
and
*NL*
at
the
thought
of
her
loneliness
two
large
tears
came
rolling
down
her
*NL*
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
do
n't
go
on
like
that
!
'
cried
the
poor
Queen
,
wringing
her
hands
in
*NL*
despair
.
`
Consider
what
a
great
girl
you
are
.
Consider
what
a
long
way
*NL*
you
've
come
to-day
.
Consider
what
o'clock
it
is
.
Consider
anything
,
only
*NL*
do
n't
cry
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
,
even
in
the
midst
of
her
tears
.
*NL*
`
Can
YOU
keep
from
crying
by
considering
things
?
'
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
the
way
it
's
done
,
'
the
Queen
said
with
great
decision
:
`
nobody
*NL*
can
do
two
things
at
once
,
you
know
.
Let
's
consider
your
age
to
begin
*NL*
with
--
how
old
are
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
seven
and
a
half
exactly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
need
n't
say
``
exactually
,
''
'
the
Queen
remarked
:
'
I
can
believe
*NL*
it
without
that
.
Now
I
'll
give
YOU
something
to
believe
.
I
'm
just
one
*NL*
hundred
and
one
,
five
months
and
a
day
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
believe
THAT
!
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ca
n't
you
?
'
the
Queen
said
in
a
pitying
tone
.
`
Try
again
:
draw
a
long
*NL*
breath
,
and
shut
your
eyes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
laughed
.
`
There
's
no
use
trying
,
'
she
said
:
`
one
CA
N'T
believe
*NL*
impossible
things
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
daresay
you
have
n't
had
much
practice
,
'
said
the
Queen
.
`
When
I
was
*NL*
your
age
,
I
always
did
it
for
half-an-hour
a
day
.
Why
,
sometimes
I
've
*NL*
believed
as
many
as
six
impossible
things
before
breakfast
.
There
goes
*NL*
the
shawl
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
brooch
had
come
undone
as
she
spoke
,
and
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
blew
*NL*
the
Queen
's
shawl
across
a
little
brook
.
The
Queen
spread
out
her
arms
*NL*
again
,
and
went
flying
after
it
,
and
this
time
she
succeeded
in
catching
*NL*
it
for
herself
.
`
I
've
got
it
!
'
she
cried
in
a
triumphant
tone
.
`
Now
you
*NL*
shall
see
me
pin
it
on
again
,
all
by
myself
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
hope
your
finger
is
better
now
?
'
Alice
said
very
politely
,
as
*NL*
she
crossed
the
little
brook
after
the
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
much
better
!
'
cried
the
Queen
,
her
voice
rising
to
a
squeak
as
she
*NL*
went
on
.
`
Much
be-etter
!
Be-etter
!
Be-e-e-etter
!
Be-e-ehh
!
'
The
last
*NL*
word
ended
in
a
long
bleat
,
so
like
a
sheep
that
Alice
quite
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
the
Queen
,
who
seemed
to
have
suddenly
wrapped
herself
up
*NL*
in
wool
.
Alice
rubbed
her
eyes
,
and
looked
again
.
She
could
n't
make
out
*NL*
what
had
happened
at
all
.
Was
she
in
a
shop
?
And
was
that
really
--
was
it
*NL*
really
a
SHEEP
that
was
sitting
on
the
other
side
of
the
counter
?
Rub
as
*NL*
she
could
,
she
could
make
nothing
more
of
it
:
she
was
in
a
little
dark
*NL*
shop
,
leaning
with
her
elbows
on
the
counter
,
and
opposite
to
her
was
*NL*
an
old
Sheep
,
sitting
in
an
arm-chair
knitting
,
and
every
now
and
then
*NL*
leaving
off
to
look
at
her
through
a
great
pair
of
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
it
you
want
to
buy
?
'
the
Sheep
said
at
last
,
looking
up
for
a
*NL*
moment
from
her
knitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
QUITE
know
yet
,
'
Alice
said
,
very
gently
.
'
I
should
like
to
*NL*
look
all
round
me
first
,
if
I
might
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
look
in
front
of
you
,
and
on
both
sides
,
if
you
like
,
'
said
the
*NL*
Sheep
:
`
but
you
ca
n't
look
ALL
round
you
--
unless
you
've
got
eyes
at
the
*NL*
back
of
your
head
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
,
as
it
happened
,
Alice
had
NOT
got
:
so
she
contented
herself
*NL*
with
turning
round
,
looking
at
the
shelves
as
she
came
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shop
seemed
to
be
full
of
all
manner
of
curious
things
--
but
the
*NL*
oddest
part
of
it
all
was
,
that
whenever
she
looked
hard
at
any
shelf
,
*NL*
to
make
out
exactly
what
it
had
on
it
,
that
particular
shelf
was
always
*NL*
quite
empty
:
though
the
others
round
it
were
crowded
as
full
as
they
*NL*
could
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Things
flow
about
so
here
!
'
she
said
at
last
in
a
plaintive
tone
,
after
*NL*
she
had
spent
a
minute
or
so
in
vainly
pursuing
a
large
bright
thing
,
*NL*
that
looked
sometimes
like
a
doll
and
sometimes
like
a
work-box
,
and
was
*NL*
always
in
the
shelf
next
above
the
one
she
was
looking
at
.
`
And
this
one
*NL*
is
the
most
provoking
of
all
--
but
I
'll
tell
you
what
--
'
she
added
,
as
a
*NL*
sudden
thought
struck
her
,
`
I
'll
follow
it
up
to
the
very
top
shelf
of
*NL*
all
.
It
'll
puzzle
it
to
go
through
the
ceiling
,
I
expect
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
this
plan
failed
:
the
`
thing
'
went
through
the
ceiling
as
*NL*
quietly
as
possible
,
as
if
it
were
quite
used
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
a
child
or
a
teetotum
?
'
the
Sheep
said
,
as
she
took
up
another
*NL*
pair
of
needles
.
`
You
'll
make
me
giddy
soon
,
if
you
go
on
turning
round
*NL*
like
that
.
'
She
was
now
working
with
fourteen
pairs
at
once
,
and
Alice
*NL*
could
n't
help
looking
at
her
in
great
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
CAN
she
knit
with
so
many
?
'
the
puzzled
child
thought
to
herself
.
*NL*
`
She
gets
more
and
more
like
a
porcupine
every
minute
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Can
you
row
?
'
the
Sheep
asked
,
handing
her
a
pair
of
knitting-needles
*NL*
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
a
little
--
but
not
on
land
--
and
not
with
needles
--
'
Alice
was
*NL*
beginning
to
say
,
when
suddenly
the
needles
turned
into
oars
in
her
*NL*
hands
,
and
she
found
they
were
in
a
little
boat
,
gliding
along
between
*NL*
banks
:
so
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
do
her
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Feather
!
'
cried
the
Sheep
,
as
she
took
up
another
pair
of
needles
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
did
n't
sound
like
a
remark
that
needed
any
answer
,
so
Alice
said
*NL*
nothing
,
but
pulled
away
.
There
was
something
very
queer
about
the
*NL*
water
,
she
thought
,
as
every
now
and
then
the
oars
got
fast
in
it
,
and
*NL*
would
hardly
come
out
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Feather
!
Feather
!
'
the
Sheep
cried
again
,
taking
more
needles
.
`
You
'll
*NL*
be
catching
a
crab
directly
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
dear
little
crab
!
'
thought
Alice
.
'
I
should
like
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
n't
you
hear
me
say
``
Feather
''
?
'
the
Sheep
cried
angrily
,
taking
up
*NL*
quite
a
bunch
of
needles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Indeed
I
did
,
'
said
Alice
:
`
you
've
said
it
very
often
--
and
very
loud
.
*NL*
Please
,
where
ARE
the
crabs
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
the
water
,
of
course
!
'
said
the
Sheep
,
sticking
some
of
the
needles
*NL*
into
her
hair
,
as
her
hands
were
full
.
`
Feather
,
I
say
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
WHY
do
you
say
``
feather
''
so
often
?
'
Alice
asked
at
last
,
rather
vexed
.
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
a
bird
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
,
'
said
the
Sheep
:
`
you
're
a
little
goose
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
offended
Alice
a
little
,
so
there
was
no
more
conversation
for
a
*NL*
minute
or
two
,
while
the
boat
glided
gently
on
,
sometimes
among
beds
of
*NL*
weeds
-LRB-
which
made
the
oars
stick
fast
in
the
water
,
worse
then
ever
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
under
trees
,
but
always
with
the
same
tall
river-banks
*NL*
frowning
over
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
please
!
There
are
some
scented
rushes
!
'
Alice
cried
in
a
sudden
*NL*
transport
of
delight
.
`
There
really
are
--
and
SUCH
beauties
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
need
n't
say
``
please
''
to
ME
about
'em
,
'
the
Sheep
said
,
without
*NL*
looking
up
from
her
knitting
:
'
I
did
n't
put
'em
there
,
and
I
'm
not
going
*NL*
to
take
'em
away
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
but
I
meant
--
please
,
may
we
wait
and
pick
some
?
'
Alice
pleaded
.
`
If
*NL*
you
do
n't
mind
stopping
the
boat
for
a
minute
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
am
_
I
_
to
stop
it
?
'
said
the
Sheep
.
`
If
you
leave
off
rowing
,
it
'll
*NL*
stop
of
itself
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
boat
was
left
to
drift
down
the
stream
as
it
would
,
till
it
*NL*
glided
gently
in
among
the
waving
rushes
.
And
then
the
little
sleeves
*NL*
were
carefully
rolled
up
,
and
the
little
arms
were
plunged
in
elbow-deep
*NL*
to
get
the
rushes
a
good
long
way
down
before
breaking
them
off
--
and
for
*NL*
a
while
Alice
forgot
all
about
the
Sheep
and
the
knitting
,
as
she
*NL*
bent
over
the
side
of
the
boat
,
with
just
the
ends
of
her
tangled
hair
*NL*
dipping
into
the
water
--
while
with
bright
eager
eyes
she
caught
at
one
*NL*
bunch
after
another
of
the
darling
scented
rushes
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
only
hope
the
boat
wo
n't
tipple
over
!
'
she
said
to
herself
.
`
Oh
,
WHAT
*NL*
a
lovely
one
!
Only
I
could
n't
quite
reach
it
.
'
`
And
it
certainly
DID
*NL*
seem
a
little
provoking
-LRB-
`
almost
as
if
it
happened
on
purpose
,
'
she
*NL*
thought
-RRB-
that
,
though
she
managed
to
pick
plenty
of
beautiful
rushes
as
*NL*
the
boat
glided
by
,
there
was
always
a
more
lovely
one
that
she
could
n't
*NL*
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
prettiest
are
always
further
!
'
she
said
at
last
,
with
a
sigh
at
the
*NL*
obstinacy
of
the
rushes
in
growing
so
far
off
,
as
,
with
flushed
cheeks
*NL*
and
dripping
hair
and
hands
,
she
scrambled
back
into
her
place
,
and
*NL*
began
to
arrange
her
new-found
treasures
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
mattered
it
to
her
just
then
that
the
rushes
had
begun
to
fade
,
and
*NL*
to
lose
all
their
scent
and
beauty
,
from
the
very
moment
that
she
*NL*
picked
them
?
Even
real
scented
rushes
,
you
know
,
last
only
a
very
little
*NL*
while
--
and
these
,
being
dream-rushes
,
melted
away
almost
like
snow
,
as
*NL*
they
lay
in
heaps
at
her
feet
--
but
Alice
hardly
noticed
this
,
there
were
*NL*
so
many
other
curious
things
to
think
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
n't
gone
much
farther
before
the
blade
of
one
of
the
oars
got
*NL*
fast
in
the
water
and
WOULD
N'T
come
out
again
-LRB-
so
Alice
explained
it
*NL*
afterwards
-RRB-
,
and
the
consequence
was
that
the
handle
of
it
caught
her
*NL*
under
the
chin
,
and
,
in
spite
of
a
series
of
little
shrieks
of
`
Oh
,
oh
,
*NL*
oh
!
'
from
poor
Alice
,
it
swept
her
straight
off
the
seat
,
and
down
among
*NL*
the
heap
of
rushes
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
she
was
n't
hurt
,
and
was
soon
up
again
:
the
Sheep
went
on
with
*NL*
her
knitting
all
the
while
,
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
`
That
was
*NL*
a
nice
crab
you
caught
!
'
she
remarked
,
as
Alice
got
back
into
her
place
,
*NL*
very
much
relieved
to
find
herself
still
in
the
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Was
it
?
I
did
n't
see
it
,
'
Said
Alice
,
peeping
cautiously
over
the
side
*NL*
of
the
boat
into
the
dark
water
.
'
I
wish
it
had
n't
let
go
--
I
should
*NL*
so
like
to
see
a
little
crab
to
take
home
with
me
!
'
But
the
Sheep
only
*NL*
laughed
scornfully
,
and
went
on
with
her
knitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
there
many
crabs
here
?
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Crabs
,
and
all
sorts
of
things
,
'
said
the
Sheep
:
`
plenty
of
choice
,
*NL*
only
make
up
your
mind
.
Now
,
what
DO
you
want
to
buy
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
buy
!
'
Alice
echoed
in
a
tone
that
was
half
astonished
and
half
*NL*
frightened
--
for
the
oars
,
and
the
boat
,
and
the
river
,
had
vanished
all
*NL*
in
a
moment
,
and
she
was
back
again
in
the
little
dark
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
like
to
buy
an
egg
,
please
,
'
she
said
timidly
.
`
How
do
you
*NL*
sell
them
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fivepence
farthing
for
one
--
Twopence
for
two
,
'
the
Sheep
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
two
are
cheaper
than
one
?
'
Alice
said
in
a
surprised
tone
,
taking
*NL*
out
her
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
you
MUST
eat
them
both
,
if
you
buy
two
,
'
said
the
Sheep
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
'll
have
ONE
,
please
,
'
said
Alice
,
as
she
put
the
money
down
on
*NL*
the
counter
.
For
she
thought
to
herself
,
`
They
might
n't
be
at
all
nice
,
*NL*
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sheep
took
the
money
,
and
put
it
away
in
a
box
:
then
she
said
'
I
*NL*
never
put
things
into
people
's
hands
--
that
would
never
do
--
you
must
get
*NL*
it
for
yourself
.
'
And
so
saying
,
she
went
off
to
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
shop
,
and
set
the
egg
upright
on
a
shelf
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wonder
WHY
it
would
n't
do
?
'
thought
Alice
,
as
she
groped
her
way
*NL*
among
the
tables
and
chairs
,
for
the
shop
was
very
dark
towards
the
end
.
*NL*
`
The
egg
seems
to
get
further
away
the
more
I
walk
towards
it
.
Let
me
*NL*
see
,
is
this
a
chair
?
Why
,
it
's
got
branches
,
I
declare
!
How
very
odd
to
*NL*
find
trees
growing
here
!
And
actually
here
's
a
little
brook
!
Well
,
this
*NL*
is
the
very
queerest
shop
I
ever
saw
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
went
on
,
wondering
more
and
more
at
every
step
,
as
everything
*NL*
turned
into
a
tree
the
moment
she
came
up
to
it
,
and
she
quite
expected
*NL*
the
egg
to
do
the
same
.

CHAPTER
VI
.
Humpty
Dumpty
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
egg
only
got
larger
and
larger
,
and
more
and
more
human
:
*NL*
when
she
had
come
within
a
few
yards
of
it
,
she
saw
that
it
had
eyes
*NL*
and
a
nose
and
mouth
;
and
when
she
had
come
close
to
it
,
she
saw
clearly
*NL*
that
it
was
HUMPTY
DUMPTY
himself
.
`
It
ca
n't
be
anybody
else
!
'
she
said
*NL*
to
herself
.
`
I
'm
as
certain
of
it
,
as
if
his
name
were
written
all
over
*NL*
his
face
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
written
a
hundred
times
,
easily
,
on
that
enormous
*NL*
face
.
Humpty
Dumpty
was
sitting
with
his
legs
crossed
,
like
a
Turk
,
on
*NL*
the
top
of
a
high
wall
--
such
a
narrow
one
that
Alice
quite
wondered
how
*NL*
he
could
keep
his
balance
--
and
,
as
his
eyes
were
steadily
fixed
in
the
*NL*
opposite
direction
,
and
he
did
n't
take
the
least
notice
of
her
,
she
*NL*
thought
he
must
be
a
stuffed
figure
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
how
exactly
like
an
egg
he
is
!
'
she
said
aloud
,
standing
with
her
*NL*
hands
ready
to
catch
him
,
for
she
was
every
moment
expecting
him
to
*NL*
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
VERY
provoking
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
said
after
a
long
silence
,
looking
*NL*
away
from
Alice
as
he
spoke
,
`
to
be
called
an
egg
--
VERY
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
said
you
LOOKED
like
an
egg
,
Sir
,
'
Alice
gently
explained
.
`
And
some
*NL*
eggs
are
very
pretty
,
you
know
'
she
added
,
hoping
to
turn
her
remark
*NL*
into
a
sort
of
a
compliment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Some
people
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
,
looking
away
from
her
as
usual
,
`
have
*NL*
no
more
sense
than
a
baby
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
did
n't
know
what
to
say
to
this
:
it
was
n't
at
all
like
*NL*
conversation
,
she
thought
,
as
he
never
said
anything
to
HER
;
in
fact
,
*NL*
his
last
remark
was
evidently
addressed
to
a
tree
--
so
she
stood
and
*NL*
softly
repeated
to
herself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Humpty
Dumpty
sat
on
a
wall
:
*NL*
Humpty
Dumpty
had
a
great
fall
.
*NL*
All
the
King
's
horses
and
all
the
King
's
men
*NL*
Could
n't
put
Humpty
Dumpty
in
his
place
again
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
last
line
is
much
too
long
for
the
poetry
,
'
she
added
,
almost
out
*NL*
loud
,
forgetting
that
Humpty
Dumpty
would
hear
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
stand
there
chattering
to
yourself
like
that
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
*NL*
said
,
looking
at
her
for
the
first
time
,
`
but
tell
me
your
name
and
your
*NL*
business
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
NAME
is
Alice
,
but
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
stupid
enough
name
!
'
Humpty
Dumpty
interrupted
impatiently
.
*NL*
`
What
does
it
mean
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
MUST
a
name
mean
something
?
'
Alice
asked
doubtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
it
must
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
said
with
a
short
laugh
:
`
MY
name
*NL*
means
the
shape
I
am
--
and
a
good
handsome
shape
it
is
,
too
.
With
a
name
*NL*
like
yours
,
you
might
be
any
shape
,
almost
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
do
you
sit
out
here
all
alone
?
'
said
Alice
,
not
wishing
to
begin
an
*NL*
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
because
there
's
nobody
with
me
!
'
cried
Humpty
Dumpty
.
`
Did
you
*NL*
think
I
did
n't
know
the
answer
to
THAT
?
Ask
another
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
you
think
you
'd
be
safer
down
on
the
ground
?
'
Alice
went
on
,
not
*NL*
with
any
idea
of
making
another
riddle
,
but
simply
in
her
good-natured
*NL*
anxiety
for
the
queer
creature
.
`
That
wall
is
so
VERY
narrow
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
tremendously
easy
riddles
you
ask
!
'
Humpty
Dumpty
growled
out
.
`
Of
*NL*
course
I
do
n't
think
so
!
Why
,
if
ever
I
DID
fall
off
--
which
there
's
no
*NL*
chance
of
--
but
IF
I
did
--
'
Here
he
pursed
up
his
lips
and
looked
so
solemn
*NL*
and
grand
that
Alice
could
hardly
help
laughing
.
`
IF
I
did
fall
,
'
he
*NL*
went
on
,
`
THE
KING
HAS
PROMISED
ME
--
ah
,
you
may
turn
pale
,
if
you
like
!
*NL*
You
did
n't
think
I
was
going
to
say
that
,
did
you
?
THE
KING
HAS
PROMISED
ME
--
*NL*
WITH
HIS
VERY
OWN
MOUTH
--
to
--
to
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
send
all
his
horses
and
all
his
men
,
'
Alice
interrupted
,
rather
*NL*
unwisely
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
I
declare
that
's
too
bad
!
'
Humpty
Dumpty
cried
,
breaking
into
a
*NL*
sudden
passion
.
`
You
've
been
listening
at
doors
--
and
behind
trees
--
and
*NL*
down
chimneys
--
or
you
could
n't
have
known
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
n't
,
indeed
!
'
Alice
said
very
gently
.
`
It
's
in
a
book
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
well
!
They
may
write
such
things
in
a
BOOK
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
said
in
*NL*
a
calmer
tone
.
`
That
's
what
you
call
a
History
of
England
,
that
is
.
*NL*
Now
,
take
a
good
look
at
me
!
I
'm
one
that
has
spoken
to
a
King
,
_
I
_
am
:
*NL*
mayhap
you
'll
never
see
such
another
:
and
to
show
you
I
'm
not
proud
,
you
*NL*
may
shake
hands
with
me
!
'
And
he
grinned
almost
from
ear
to
ear
,
as
he
*NL*
leant
forwards
-LRB-
and
as
nearly
as
possible
fell
off
the
wall
in
doing
so
-RRB-
*NL*
and
offered
Alice
his
hand
.
She
watched
him
a
little
anxiously
as
she
*NL*
took
it
.
`
If
he
smiled
much
more
,
the
ends
of
his
mouth
might
meet
*NL*
behind
,
'
she
thought
:
`
and
then
I
do
n't
know
what
would
happen
to
his
*NL*
head
!
I
'm
afraid
it
would
come
off
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
all
his
horses
and
all
his
men
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
went
on
.
`
They
'd
*NL*
pick
me
up
again
in
a
minute
,
THEY
would
!
However
,
this
conversation
is
*NL*
going
on
a
little
too
fast
:
let
's
go
back
to
the
last
remark
but
one
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
afraid
I
ca
n't
quite
remember
it
,
'
Alice
said
very
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
that
case
we
start
fresh
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
,
`
and
it
's
my
turn
*NL*
to
choose
a
subject
--
'
-LRB-
`
He
talks
about
it
just
as
if
it
was
a
game
!
'
*NL*
thought
Alice
.
-RRB-
`
So
here
's
a
question
for
you
.
How
old
did
you
say
you
*NL*
were
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
made
a
short
calculation
,
and
said
`
Seven
years
and
six
months
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wrong
!
'
Humpty
Dumpty
exclaimed
triumphantly
.
`
You
never
said
a
word
*NL*
like
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
though
you
meant
``
How
old
ARE
you
?
''
'
Alice
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
'd
meant
that
,
I
'd
have
said
it
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
did
n't
want
to
begin
another
argument
,
so
she
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Seven
years
and
six
months
!
'
Humpty
Dumpty
repeated
thoughtfully
.
`
An
*NL*
uncomfortable
sort
of
age
.
Now
if
you
'd
asked
MY
advice
,
I
'd
have
said
*NL*
``
Leave
off
at
seven
''
--
but
it
's
too
late
now
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
never
ask
advice
about
growing
,
'
Alice
said
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Too
proud
?
'
the
other
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
felt
even
more
indignant
at
this
suggestion
.
'
I
mean
,
'
she
said
,
*NL*
`
that
one
ca
n't
help
growing
older
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
ONE
ca
n't
,
perhaps
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
,
`
but
TWO
can
.
With
proper
*NL*
assistance
,
you
might
have
left
off
at
seven
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
beautiful
belt
you
've
got
on
!
'
Alice
suddenly
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
They
had
had
quite
enough
of
the
subject
of
age
,
she
thought
:
and
if
*NL*
they
really
were
to
take
turns
in
choosing
subjects
,
it
was
her
turn
*NL*
now
.
-RRB-
`
At
least
,
'
she
corrected
herself
on
second
thoughts
,
'
a
beautiful
*NL*
cravat
,
I
should
have
said
--
no
,
a
belt
,
I
mean
--
I
beg
your
pardon
!
'
she
*NL*
added
in
dismay
,
for
Humpty
Dumpty
looked
thoroughly
offended
,
and
she
*NL*
began
to
wish
she
had
n't
chosen
that
subject
.
`
If
I
only
knew
,
'
she
*NL*
thought
to
herself
,
`
which
was
neck
and
which
was
waist
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Evidently
Humpty
Dumpty
was
very
angry
,
though
he
said
nothing
for
a
*NL*
minute
or
two
.
When
he
DID
speak
again
,
it
was
in
a
deep
growl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
a
--
MOST
--
PROVOKING
--
thing
,
'
he
said
at
last
,
`
when
a
person
*NL*
does
n't
know
a
cravat
from
a
belt
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
it
's
very
ignorant
of
me
,
'
Alice
said
,
in
so
humble
a
tone
that
*NL*
Humpty
Dumpty
relented
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
cravat
,
child
,
and
a
beautiful
one
,
as
you
say
.
It
's
a
present
*NL*
from
the
White
King
and
Queen
.
There
now
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
really
?
'
said
Alice
,
quite
pleased
to
find
that
she
HAD
chosen
a
*NL*
good
subject
,
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
gave
it
me
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
continued
thoughtfully
,
as
he
crossed
*NL*
one
knee
over
the
other
and
clasped
his
hands
round
it
,
`
they
gave
it
*NL*
me
--
for
an
un-birthday
present
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
?
'
Alice
said
with
a
puzzled
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
offended
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
mean
,
what
IS
an
un-birthday
present
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
present
given
when
it
is
n't
your
birthday
,
of
course
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
considered
a
little
.
'
I
like
birthday
presents
best
,
'
she
said
at
*NL*
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
know
what
you
're
talking
about
!
'
cried
Humpty
Dumpty
.
`
How
*NL*
many
days
are
there
in
a
year
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Three
hundred
and
sixty-five
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
how
many
birthdays
have
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
One
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
if
you
take
one
from
three
hundred
and
sixty-five
,
what
remains
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Three
hundred
and
sixty-four
,
of
course
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Humpty
Dumpty
looked
doubtful
.
`
I
'd
rather
see
that
done
on
paper
,
'
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
could
n't
help
smiling
as
she
took
out
her
memorandum-book
,
and
*NL*
worked
the
sum
for
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
365
*NL*
1
*NL*
____
*NL*
*NL*
364
*NL*
___
*NL*
*NL*
Humpty
Dumpty
took
the
book
,
and
looked
at
it
carefully
.
`
That
seems
to
*NL*
be
done
right
--
'
he
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
're
holding
it
upside
down
!
'
Alice
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
be
sure
I
was
!
'
Humpty
Dumpty
said
gaily
,
as
she
turned
it
round
for
*NL*
him
.
'
I
thought
it
looked
a
little
queer
.
As
I
was
saying
,
that
SEEMS
*NL*
to
be
done
right
--
though
I
have
n't
time
to
look
it
over
thoroughly
just
*NL*
now
--
and
that
shows
that
there
are
three
hundred
and
sixty-four
days
*NL*
when
you
might
get
un-birthday
presents
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
only
ONE
for
birthday
presents
,
you
know
.
There
's
glory
for
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
``
glory
,
''
'
Alice
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Humpty
Dumpty
smiled
contemptuously
.
`
Of
course
you
do
n't
--
till
I
tell
*NL*
you
.
I
meant
``
there
's
a
nice
knock-down
argument
for
you
!
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
``
glory
''
does
n't
mean
``
a
nice
knock-down
argument
,
''
'
Alice
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
_
I
_
use
a
word
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
said
in
rather
a
scornful
tone
,
`
it
*NL*
means
just
what
I
choose
it
to
mean
--
neither
more
nor
less
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
question
is
,
'
said
Alice
,
`
whether
you
CAN
make
words
mean
so
many
*NL*
different
things
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
question
is
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
,
`
which
is
to
be
master
--
that
's
*NL*
all
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
was
too
much
puzzled
to
say
anything
,
so
after
a
minute
Humpty
*NL*
Dumpty
began
again
.
`
They
've
a
temper
,
some
of
them
--
particularly
verbs
,
*NL*
they
're
the
proudest
--
adjectives
you
can
do
anything
with
,
but
not
*NL*
verbs
--
however
,
_
I
_
can
manage
the
whole
lot
of
them
!
Impenetrability
!
*NL*
That
's
what
_
I
_
say
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Would
you
tell
me
,
please
,
'
said
Alice
`
what
that
means
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
you
talk
like
a
reasonable
child
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
,
looking
very
*NL*
much
pleased
.
'
I
meant
by
``
impenetrability
''
that
we
've
had
enough
of
*NL*
that
subject
,
and
it
would
be
just
as
well
if
you
'd
mention
what
you
*NL*
mean
to
do
next
,
as
I
suppose
you
do
n't
mean
to
stop
here
all
the
rest
*NL*
of
your
life
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
a
great
deal
to
make
one
word
mean
,
'
Alice
said
in
a
thoughtful
*NL*
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
I
make
a
word
do
a
lot
of
work
like
that
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
,
'
I
*NL*
always
pay
it
extra
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
!
'
said
Alice
.
She
was
too
much
puzzled
to
make
any
other
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
you
should
see
'em
come
round
me
of
a
Saturday
night
,
'
Humpty
*NL*
Dumpty
went
on
,
wagging
his
head
gravely
from
side
to
side
:
`
for
to
get
*NL*
their
wages
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Alice
did
n't
venture
to
ask
what
he
paid
them
with
;
and
so
you
see
I
*NL*
ca
n't
tell
YOU
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
seem
very
clever
at
explaining
words
,
Sir
,
'
said
Alice
.
`
Would
you
*NL*
kindly
tell
me
the
meaning
of
the
poem
called
``
Jabberwocky
''
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
's
hear
it
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
.
'
I
can
explain
all
the
poems
that
*NL*
were
ever
invented
--
and
a
good
many
that
have
n't
been
invented
just
*NL*
yet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
sounded
very
hopeful
,
so
Alice
repeated
the
first
verse
:
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
brillig
,
and
the
slithy
toves
*NL*
Did
gyre
and
gimble
in
the
wabe
;
*NL*
All
mimsy
were
the
borogoves
,
*NL*
And
the
mome
raths
outgrabe
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
enough
to
begin
with
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
interrupted
:
`
there
*NL*
are
plenty
of
hard
words
there
.
``
BRILLIG
''
means
four
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
--
the
time
when
you
begin
BROILING
things
for
dinner
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
'll
do
very
well
,
'
said
Alice
:
`
and
``
SLITHY
''
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
``
SLITHY
''
means
``
lithe
and
slimy
.
''
``
Lithe
''
is
the
same
as
*NL*
``
active
.
''
You
see
it
's
like
a
portmanteau
--
there
are
two
meanings
packed
*NL*
up
into
one
word
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
it
now
,
'
Alice
remarked
thoughtfully
:
`
and
what
are
``
TOVES
''
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
``
TOVES
''
are
something
like
badgers
--
they
're
something
like
*NL*
lizards
--
and
they
're
something
like
corkscrews
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
must
be
very
curious
looking
creatures
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
are
that
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
:
`
also
they
make
their
nests
under
*NL*
sun-dials
--
also
they
live
on
cheese
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
's
the
``
GYRE
''
and
to
``
GIMBLE
''
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
``
GYRE
''
is
to
go
round
and
round
like
a
gyroscope
.
To
``
GIMBLE
''
is
to
*NL*
make
holes
like
a
gimlet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
``
THE
WABE
''
is
the
grass-plot
round
a
sun-dial
,
I
suppose
?
'
said
*NL*
Alice
,
surprised
at
her
own
ingenuity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
it
is
.
It
's
called
``
WABE
,
''
you
know
,
because
it
goes
a
long
*NL*
way
before
it
,
and
a
long
way
behind
it
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
a
long
way
beyond
it
on
each
side
,
'
Alice
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Exactly
so
.
Well
,
then
,
``
MIMSY
''
is
``
flimsy
and
miserable
''
-LRB-
there
's
*NL*
another
portmanteau
for
you
-RRB-
.
And
a
``
BOROGOVE
''
is
a
thin
shabby-looking
*NL*
bird
with
its
feathers
sticking
out
all
round
--
something
like
a
live
*NL*
mop
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
then
``
MOME
RATHS
''
?
'
said
Alice
.
`
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
giving
you
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
trouble
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
a
``
RATH
''
is
a
sort
of
green
pig
:
but
``
MOME
''
I
'm
not
certain
*NL*
about
.
I
think
it
's
short
for
``
from
home
''
--
meaning
that
they
'd
lost
*NL*
their
way
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
does
``
OUTGRABE
''
mean
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
``
OUTGRABING
''
is
something
between
bellowing
and
whistling
,
with
a
*NL*
kind
of
sneeze
in
the
middle
:
however
,
you
'll
hear
it
done
,
maybe
--
down
*NL*
in
the
wood
yonder
--
and
when
you
've
once
heard
it
you
'll
be
QUITE
*NL*
content
.
Who
's
been
repeating
all
that
hard
stuff
to
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
read
it
in
a
book
,
'
said
Alice
.
`
But
I
had
some
poetry
repeated
to
*NL*
me
,
much
easier
than
that
,
by
--
Tweedledee
,
I
think
it
was
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
to
poetry
,
you
know
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
,
stretching
out
one
of
his
*NL*
great
hands
,
'
_
I
_
can
repeat
poetry
as
well
as
other
folk
,
if
it
comes
*NL*
to
that
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
it
need
n't
come
to
that
!
'
Alice
hastily
said
,
hoping
to
keep
him
*NL*
from
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
piece
I
'm
going
to
repeat
,
'
he
went
on
without
noticing
her
remark
,
*NL*
`
was
written
entirely
for
your
amusement
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
felt
that
in
that
case
she
really
OUGHT
to
listen
to
it
,
so
she
*NL*
sat
down
,
and
said
`
Thank
you
'
rather
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
winter
,
when
the
fields
are
white
,
*NL*
I
sing
this
song
for
your
delight
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
only
I
do
n't
sing
it
,
'
he
added
,
as
an
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
you
do
n't
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
you
can
SEE
whether
I
'm
singing
or
not
,
you
've
sharper
eyes
than
*NL*
most
.
'
Humpty
Dumpty
remarked
severely
.
Alice
was
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
spring
,
when
woods
are
getting
green
,
*NL*
I
'll
try
and
tell
you
what
I
mean
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
very
much
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
summer
,
when
the
days
are
long
,
*NL*
Perhaps
you
'll
understand
the
song
:
*NL*
In
autumn
,
when
the
leaves
are
brown
,
*NL*
Take
pen
and
ink
,
and
write
it
down
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
,
if
I
can
remember
it
so
long
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
need
n't
go
on
making
remarks
like
that
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
said
:
*NL*
`
they
're
not
sensible
,
and
they
put
me
out
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
sent
a
message
to
the
fish
:
*NL*
I
told
them
``
This
is
what
I
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
fishes
of
the
sea
,
*NL*
They
sent
an
answer
back
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
fishes
'
answer
was
*NL*
``
We
can
not
do
it
,
Sir
,
because
--
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
afraid
I
do
n't
quite
understand
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
gets
easier
further
on
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
sent
to
them
again
to
say
*NL*
``
It
will
be
better
to
obey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fishes
answered
with
a
grin
,
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
a
temper
you
are
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
them
once
,
I
told
them
twice
:
*NL*
They
would
not
listen
to
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
a
kettle
large
and
new
,
*NL*
Fit
for
the
deed
I
had
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
went
hop
,
my
heart
went
thump
;
*NL*
I
filled
the
kettle
at
the
pump
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
some
one
came
to
me
and
said
,
*NL*
``
The
little
fishes
are
in
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
to
him
,
I
said
it
plain
,
*NL*
``
Then
you
must
wake
them
up
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
it
very
loud
and
clear
;
*NL*
I
went
and
shouted
in
his
ear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Humpty
Dumpty
raised
his
voice
almost
to
a
scream
as
he
repeated
this
*NL*
verse
,
and
Alice
thought
with
a
shudder
,
'
I
would
n't
have
been
the
*NL*
messenger
for
ANYTHING
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
he
was
very
stiff
and
proud
;
*NL*
He
said
``
You
need
n't
shout
so
loud
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
was
very
proud
and
stiff
;
*NL*
He
said
``
I
'd
go
and
wake
them
,
if
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
a
corkscrew
from
the
shelf
:
*NL*
I
went
to
wake
them
up
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
I
found
the
door
was
locked
,
*NL*
I
pulled
and
pushed
and
kicked
and
knocked
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
I
found
the
door
was
shut
,
*NL*
I
tried
to
turn
the
handle
,
but
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
that
all
?
'
Alice
timidly
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
all
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
.
`
Good-bye
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
rather
sudden
,
Alice
thought
:
but
,
after
such
a
VERY
strong
*NL*
hint
that
she
ought
to
be
going
,
she
felt
that
it
would
hardly
be
civil
*NL*
to
stay
.
So
she
got
up
,
and
held
out
her
hand
.
`
Good-bye
,
till
we
meet
*NL*
again
!
'
she
said
as
cheerfully
as
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
n't
know
you
again
if
we
DID
meet
,
'
Humpty
Dumpty
replied
in
*NL*
a
discontented
tone
,
giving
her
one
of
his
fingers
to
shake
;
`
you
're
so
*NL*
exactly
like
other
people
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
face
is
what
one
goes
by
,
generally
,
'
Alice
remarked
in
a
*NL*
thoughtful
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
just
what
I
complain
of
,
'
said
Humpty
Dumpty
.
`
Your
face
is
the
*NL*
same
as
everybody
has
--
the
two
eyes
,
so
--
'
-LRB-
marking
their
places
in
the
*NL*
air
with
this
thumb
-RRB-
`
nose
in
the
middle
,
mouth
under
.
It
's
always
the
*NL*
same
.
Now
if
you
had
the
two
eyes
on
the
same
side
of
the
nose
,
for
*NL*
instance
--
or
the
mouth
at
the
top
--
that
would
be
SOME
help
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
would
n't
look
nice
,
'
Alice
objected
.
But
Humpty
Dumpty
only
shut
his
*NL*
eyes
and
said
`
Wait
till
you
've
tried
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
waited
a
minute
to
see
if
he
would
speak
again
,
but
as
he
never
*NL*
opened
his
eyes
or
took
any
further
notice
of
her
,
she
said
`
Good-bye
!
'
*NL*
once
more
,
and
,
getting
no
answer
to
this
,
she
quietly
walked
away
:
*NL*
but
she
could
n't
help
saying
to
herself
as
she
went
,
`
Of
all
the
*NL*
unsatisfactory
--
'
-LRB-
she
repeated
this
aloud
,
as
it
was
a
great
comfort
to
*NL*
have
such
a
long
word
to
say
-RRB-
`
of
all
the
unsatisfactory
people
I
EVER
*NL*
met
--
'
She
never
finished
the
sentence
,
for
at
this
moment
a
heavy
crash
*NL*
shook
the
forest
from
end
to
end
.

CHAPTER
VII
.
The
Lion
and
the
Unicorn
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
moment
soldiers
came
running
through
the
wood
,
at
first
in
twos
*NL*
and
threes
,
then
ten
or
twenty
together
,
and
at
last
in
such
crowds
that
*NL*
they
seemed
to
fill
the
whole
forest
.
Alice
got
behind
a
tree
,
for
fear
*NL*
of
being
run
over
,
and
watched
them
go
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
that
in
all
her
life
she
had
never
seen
soldiers
so
*NL*
uncertain
on
their
feet
:
they
were
always
tripping
over
something
or
*NL*
other
,
and
whenever
one
went
down
,
several
more
always
fell
over
him
,
so
*NL*
that
the
ground
was
soon
covered
with
little
heaps
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
horses
.
Having
four
feet
,
these
managed
rather
better
than
*NL*
the
foot-soldiers
:
but
even
THEY
stumbled
now
and
then
;
and
it
seemed
*NL*
to
be
a
regular
rule
that
,
whenever
a
horse
stumbled
the
rider
fell
off
*NL*
instantly
.
The
confusion
got
worse
every
moment
,
and
Alice
was
very
glad
*NL*
to
get
out
of
the
wood
into
an
open
place
,
where
she
found
the
White
*NL*
King
seated
on
the
ground
,
busily
writing
in
his
memorandum-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
sent
them
all
!
'
the
King
cried
in
a
tone
of
delight
,
on
seeing
*NL*
Alice
.
`
Did
you
happen
to
meet
any
soldiers
,
my
dear
,
as
you
came
*NL*
through
the
wood
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
did
,
'
said
Alice
:
`
several
thousand
,
I
should
think
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Four
thousand
two
hundred
and
seven
,
that
's
the
exact
number
,
'
the
King
*NL*
said
,
referring
to
his
book
.
'
I
could
n't
send
all
the
horses
,
you
know
,
*NL*
because
two
of
them
are
wanted
in
the
game
.
And
I
have
n't
sent
the
two
*NL*
Messengers
,
either
.
They
're
both
gone
to
the
town
.
Just
look
along
the
*NL*
road
,
and
tell
me
if
you
can
see
either
of
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
nobody
on
the
road
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
only
wish
_
I
_
had
such
eyes
,
'
the
King
remarked
in
a
fretful
tone
.
*NL*
`
To
be
able
to
see
Nobody
!
And
at
that
distance
,
too
!
Why
,
it
's
as
much
*NL*
as
_
I
_
can
do
to
see
real
people
,
by
this
light
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
lost
on
Alice
,
who
was
still
looking
intently
along
*NL*
the
road
,
shading
her
eyes
with
one
hand
.
'
I
see
somebody
now
!
'
she
*NL*
exclaimed
at
last
.
`
But
he
's
coming
very
slowly
--
and
what
curious
*NL*
attitudes
he
goes
into
!
'
-LRB-
For
the
messenger
kept
skipping
up
and
down
,
*NL*
and
wriggling
like
an
eel
,
as
he
came
along
,
with
his
great
hands
spread
*NL*
out
like
fans
on
each
side
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
at
all
,
'
said
the
King
.
`
He
's
an
Anglo-Saxon
Messenger
--
and
those
*NL*
are
Anglo-Saxon
attitudes
.
He
only
does
them
when
he
's
happy
.
His
name
*NL*
is
Haigha
.
'
-LRB-
He
pronounced
it
so
as
to
rhyme
with
`
mayor
.
'
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
love
my
love
with
an
H
,
'
Alice
could
n't
help
beginning
,
`
because
*NL*
he
is
Happy
.
I
hate
him
with
an
H
,
because
he
is
Hideous
.
I
fed
him
*NL*
with
--
with
--
with
Ham-sandwiches
and
Hay
.
His
name
is
Haigha
,
and
he
*NL*
lives
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
lives
on
the
Hill
,
'
the
King
remarked
simply
,
without
the
least
idea
*NL*
that
he
was
joining
in
the
game
,
while
Alice
was
still
hesitating
for
*NL*
the
name
of
a
town
beginning
with
H.
`
The
other
Messenger
's
called
*NL*
Hatta
.
I
must
have
TWO
,
you
know
--
to
come
and
go
.
One
to
come
,
and
one
*NL*
to
go
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
beg
your
pardon
?
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
n't
respectable
to
beg
,
'
said
the
King
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
only
meant
that
I
did
n't
understand
,
'
said
Alice
.
`
Why
one
to
come
*NL*
and
one
to
go
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
n't
I
tell
you
?
'
the
King
repeated
impatiently
.
'
I
must
have
Two
--
to
*NL*
fetch
and
carry
.
One
to
fetch
,
and
one
to
carry
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
Messenger
arrived
:
he
was
far
too
much
out
of
breath
*NL*
to
say
a
word
,
and
could
only
wave
his
hands
about
,
and
make
the
most
*NL*
fearful
faces
at
the
poor
King
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
young
lady
loves
you
with
an
H
,
'
the
King
said
,
introducing
Alice
*NL*
in
the
hope
of
turning
off
the
Messenger
's
attention
from
himself
--
but
*NL*
it
was
no
use
--
the
Anglo-Saxon
attitudes
only
got
more
extraordinary
*NL*
every
moment
,
while
the
great
eyes
rolled
wildly
from
side
to
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
alarm
me
!
'
said
the
King
.
'
I
feel
faint
--
Give
me
a
ham
sandwich
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
On
which
the
Messenger
,
to
Alice
's
great
amusement
,
opened
a
bag
that
*NL*
hung
round
his
neck
,
and
handed
a
sandwich
to
the
King
,
who
devoured
it
*NL*
greedily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Another
sandwich
!
'
said
the
King
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
nothing
but
hay
left
now
,
'
the
Messenger
said
,
peeping
into
the
*NL*
bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hay
,
then
,
'
the
King
murmured
in
a
faint
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
was
glad
to
see
that
it
revived
him
a
good
deal
.
`
There
's
nothing
*NL*
like
eating
hay
when
you
're
faint
,
'
he
remarked
to
her
,
as
he
munched
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
think
throwing
cold
water
over
you
would
be
better
,
'
Alice
*NL*
suggested
:
`
or
some
sal-volatile
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
say
there
was
nothing
BETTER
,
'
the
King
replied
.
'
I
said
there
*NL*
was
nothing
LIKE
it
.
'
Which
Alice
did
not
venture
to
deny
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
did
you
pass
on
the
road
?
'
the
King
went
on
,
holding
out
his
hand
*NL*
to
the
Messenger
for
some
more
hay
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nobody
,
'
said
the
Messenger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
right
,
'
said
the
King
:
`
this
young
lady
saw
him
too
.
So
of
course
*NL*
Nobody
walks
slower
than
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
my
best
,
'
the
Messenger
said
in
a
sulky
tone
.
`
I
'm
sure
nobody
*NL*
walks
much
faster
than
I
do
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
ca
n't
do
that
,
'
said
the
King
,
`
or
else
he
'd
have
been
here
first
.
*NL*
However
,
now
you
've
got
your
breath
,
you
may
tell
us
what
's
happened
in
*NL*
the
town
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
whisper
it
,
'
said
the
Messenger
,
putting
his
hands
to
his
mouth
*NL*
in
the
shape
of
a
trumpet
,
and
stooping
so
as
to
get
close
to
the
King
's
*NL*
ear
.
Alice
was
sorry
for
this
,
as
she
wanted
to
hear
the
news
too
.
*NL*
However
,
instead
of
whispering
,
he
simply
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
*NL*
voice
`
They
're
at
it
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
call
THAT
a
whisper
?
'
cried
the
poor
King
,
jumping
up
and
*NL*
shaking
himself
.
`
If
you
do
such
a
thing
again
,
I
'll
have
you
buttered
!
*NL*
It
went
through
and
through
my
head
like
an
earthquake
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
would
have
to
be
a
very
tiny
earthquake
!
'
thought
Alice
.
`
Who
are
at
*NL*
it
again
?
'
she
ventured
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
the
Lion
and
the
Unicorn
,
of
course
,
'
said
the
King
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fighting
for
the
crown
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
'
said
the
King
:
`
and
the
best
of
the
joke
is
,
that
*NL*
it
's
MY
crown
all
the
while
!
Let
's
run
and
see
them
.
'
And
they
trotted
*NL*
off
,
Alice
repeating
to
herself
,
as
she
ran
,
the
words
of
the
old
*NL*
song
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
Lion
and
the
Unicorn
were
fighting
for
the
crown
:
*NL*
The
Lion
beat
the
Unicorn
all
round
the
town
.
*NL*
Some
gave
them
white
bread
,
some
gave
them
brown
;
*NL*
Some
gave
them
plum-cake
and
drummed
them
out
of
town
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Does
--
the
one
--
that
wins
--
get
the
crown
?
'
she
asked
,
as
well
as
she
*NL*
could
,
for
the
run
was
putting
her
quite
out
of
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dear
me
,
no
!
'
said
the
King
.
`
What
an
idea
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Would
you
--
be
good
enough
,
'
Alice
panted
out
,
after
running
a
little
*NL*
further
,
`
to
stop
a
minute
--
just
to
get
--
one
's
breath
again
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
GOOD
enough
,
'
the
King
said
,
`
only
I
'm
not
strong
enough
.
You
see
,
*NL*
a
minute
goes
by
so
fearfully
quick
.
You
might
as
well
try
to
stop
a
*NL*
Bandersnatch
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
had
no
more
breath
for
talking
,
so
they
trotted
on
in
silence
,
*NL*
till
they
came
in
sight
of
a
great
crowd
,
in
the
middle
of
which
the
*NL*
Lion
and
Unicorn
were
fighting
.
They
were
in
such
a
cloud
of
dust
,
that
*NL*
at
first
Alice
could
not
make
out
which
was
which
:
but
she
soon
managed
*NL*
to
distinguish
the
Unicorn
by
his
horn
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
placed
themselves
close
to
where
Hatta
,
the
other
messenger
,
was
*NL*
standing
watching
the
fight
,
with
a
cup
of
tea
in
one
hand
and
a
piece
*NL*
of
bread-and-butter
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
's
only
just
out
of
prison
,
and
he
had
n't
finished
his
tea
when
*NL*
he
was
sent
in
,
'
Haigha
whispered
to
Alice
:
`
and
they
only
give
them
*NL*
oyster-shells
in
there
--
so
you
see
he
's
very
hungry
and
thirsty
.
How
*NL*
are
you
,
dear
child
?
'
he
went
on
,
putting
his
arm
affectionately
round
*NL*
Hatta
's
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hatta
looked
round
and
nodded
,
and
went
on
with
his
bread
and
butter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Were
you
happy
in
prison
,
dear
child
?
'
said
Haigha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hatta
looked
round
once
more
,
and
this
time
a
tear
or
two
trickled
down
*NL*
his
cheek
:
but
not
a
word
would
he
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Speak
,
ca
n't
you
!
'
Haigha
cried
impatiently
.
But
Hatta
only
munched
*NL*
away
,
and
drank
some
more
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Speak
,
wo
n't
you
!
'
cried
the
King
.
`
How
are
they
getting
on
with
the
*NL*
fight
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Hatta
made
a
desperate
effort
,
and
swallowed
a
large
piece
of
*NL*
bread-and-butter
.
`
They
're
getting
on
very
well
,
'
he
said
in
a
choking
*NL*
voice
:
`
each
of
them
has
been
down
about
eighty-seven
times
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
suppose
they
'll
soon
bring
the
white
bread
and
the
brown
?
'
Alice
*NL*
ventured
to
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
waiting
for
'em
now
,
'
said
Hatta
:
`
this
is
a
bit
of
it
as
I
'm
*NL*
eating
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
in
the
fight
just
then
,
and
the
Lion
and
the
Unicorn
*NL*
sat
down
,
panting
,
while
the
King
called
out
`
Ten
minutes
allowed
for
*NL*
refreshments
!
'
Haigha
and
Hatta
set
to
work
at
once
,
carrying
rough
*NL*
trays
of
white
and
brown
bread
.
Alice
took
a
piece
to
taste
,
but
it
was
*NL*
VERY
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
think
they
'll
fight
any
more
to-day
,
'
the
King
said
to
Hatta
:
*NL*
`
go
and
order
the
drums
to
begin
.
'
And
Hatta
went
bounding
away
like
a
*NL*
grasshopper
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
minute
or
two
Alice
stood
silent
,
watching
him
.
Suddenly
she
*NL*
brightened
up
.
`
Look
,
look
!
'
she
cried
,
pointing
eagerly
.
`
There
's
the
*NL*
White
Queen
running
across
the
country
!
She
came
flying
out
of
the
wood
*NL*
over
yonder
--
How
fast
those
Queens
CAN
run
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
some
enemy
after
her
,
no
doubt
,
'
the
King
said
,
without
even
*NL*
looking
round
.
`
That
wood
's
full
of
them
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
are
n't
you
going
to
run
and
help
her
?
'
Alice
asked
,
very
much
*NL*
surprised
at
his
taking
it
so
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
use
,
no
use
!
'
said
the
King
.
`
She
runs
so
fearfully
quick
.
You
might
*NL*
as
well
try
to
catch
a
Bandersnatch
!
But
I
'll
make
a
memorandum
about
*NL*
her
,
if
you
like
--
She
's
a
dear
good
creature
,
'
he
repeated
softly
to
*NL*
himself
,
as
he
opened
his
memorandum-book
.
`
Do
you
spell
``
creature
''
with
*NL*
a
double
``
e
''
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
Unicorn
sauntered
by
them
,
with
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
pockets
.
'
I
had
the
best
of
it
this
time
?
'
he
said
to
the
King
,
just
*NL*
glancing
at
him
as
he
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
little
--
a
little
,
'
the
King
replied
,
rather
nervously
.
`
You
should
n't
*NL*
have
run
him
through
with
your
horn
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
did
n't
hurt
him
,
'
the
Unicorn
said
carelessly
,
and
he
was
going
*NL*
on
,
when
his
eye
happened
to
fall
upon
Alice
:
he
turned
round
rather
*NL*
instantly
,
and
stood
for
some
time
looking
at
her
with
an
air
of
the
*NL*
deepest
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
--
is
--
this
?
'
he
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
is
a
child
!
'
Haigha
replied
eagerly
,
coming
in
front
of
Alice
*NL*
to
introduce
her
,
and
spreading
out
both
his
hands
towards
her
in
an
*NL*
Anglo-Saxon
attitude
.
`
We
only
found
it
to-day
.
It
's
as
large
as
life
,
*NL*
and
twice
as
natural
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
always
thought
they
were
fabulous
monsters
!
'
said
the
Unicorn
.
`
Is
it
*NL*
alive
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
can
talk
,
'
said
Haigha
,
solemnly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Unicorn
looked
dreamily
at
Alice
,
and
said
`
Talk
,
child
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
could
not
help
her
lips
curling
up
into
a
smile
as
she
began
:
`
Do
*NL*
you
know
,
I
always
thought
Unicorns
were
fabulous
monsters
,
too
!
I
never
*NL*
saw
one
alive
before
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
now
that
we
HAVE
seen
each
other
,
'
said
the
Unicorn
,
`
if
you
'll
*NL*
believe
in
me
,
I
'll
believe
in
you
.
Is
that
a
bargain
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
if
you
like
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Come
,
fetch
out
the
plum-cake
,
old
man
!
'
the
Unicorn
went
on
,
turning
*NL*
from
her
to
the
King
.
`
None
of
your
brown
bread
for
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
--
certainly
!
'
the
King
muttered
,
and
beckoned
to
Haigha
.
`
Open
*NL*
the
bag
!
'
he
whispered
.
`
Quick
!
Not
that
one
--
that
's
full
of
hay
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Haigha
took
a
large
cake
out
of
the
bag
,
and
gave
it
to
Alice
to
hold
,
*NL*
while
he
got
out
a
dish
and
carving-knife
.
How
they
all
came
out
of
it
*NL*
Alice
could
n't
guess
.
It
was
just
like
a
conjuring-trick
,
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Lion
had
joined
them
while
this
was
going
on
:
he
looked
very
*NL*
tired
and
sleepy
,
and
his
eyes
were
half
shut
.
`
What
's
this
!
'
he
said
,
*NL*
blinking
lazily
at
Alice
,
and
speaking
in
a
deep
hollow
tone
that
*NL*
sounded
like
the
tolling
of
a
great
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ah
,
what
IS
it
,
now
?
'
the
Unicorn
cried
eagerly
.
`
You
'll
never
guess
!
*NL*
_
I
_
could
n't
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Lion
looked
at
Alice
wearily
.
`
Are
you
animal
--
vegetable
--
or
*NL*
mineral
?
'
he
said
,
yawning
at
every
other
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
fabulous
monster
!
'
the
Unicorn
cried
out
,
before
Alice
could
*NL*
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
hand
round
the
plum-cake
,
Monster
,
'
the
Lion
said
,
lying
down
and
*NL*
putting
his
chin
on
his
paws
.
`
And
sit
down
,
both
of
you
,
'
-LRB-
to
the
King
*NL*
and
the
Unicorn
-RRB-
:
`
fair
play
with
the
cake
,
you
know
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
King
was
evidently
very
uncomfortable
at
having
to
sit
down
between
*NL*
the
two
great
creatures
;
but
there
was
no
other
place
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
a
fight
we
might
have
for
the
crown
,
NOW
!
'
the
Unicorn
said
,
*NL*
looking
slyly
up
at
the
crown
,
which
the
poor
King
was
nearly
shaking
*NL*
off
his
head
,
he
trembled
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
win
easy
,
'
said
the
Lion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
not
so
sure
of
that
,
'
said
the
Unicorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
I
beat
you
all
round
the
town
,
you
chicken
!
'
the
Lion
replied
*NL*
angrily
,
half
getting
up
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
King
interrupted
,
to
prevent
the
quarrel
going
on
:
he
was
very
*NL*
nervous
,
and
his
voice
quite
quivered
.
`
All
round
the
town
?
'
he
*NL*
said
.
`
That
's
a
good
long
way
.
Did
you
go
by
the
old
bridge
,
or
the
*NL*
market-place
?
You
get
the
best
view
by
the
old
bridge
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
know
,
'
the
Lion
growled
out
as
he
lay
down
again
.
*NL*
`
There
was
too
much
dust
to
see
anything
.
What
a
time
the
Monster
is
,
*NL*
cutting
up
that
cake
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
had
seated
herself
on
the
bank
of
a
little
brook
,
with
the
great
*NL*
dish
on
her
knees
,
and
was
sawing
away
diligently
with
the
knife
.
`
It
's
*NL*
very
provoking
!
'
she
said
,
in
reply
to
the
Lion
-LRB-
she
was
getting
quite
*NL*
used
to
being
called
`
the
Monster
'
-RRB-
.
`
I
've
cut
several
slices
already
,
*NL*
but
they
always
join
on
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
know
how
to
manage
Looking-glass
cakes
,
'
the
Unicorn
*NL*
remarked
.
`
Hand
it
round
first
,
and
cut
it
afterwards
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
sounded
nonsense
,
but
Alice
very
obediently
got
up
,
and
carried
the
*NL*
dish
round
,
and
the
cake
divided
itself
into
three
pieces
as
she
did
so
.
*NL*
`
NOW
cut
it
up
,
'
said
the
Lion
,
as
she
returned
to
her
place
with
the
*NL*
empty
dish
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
,
this
is
n't
fair
!
'
cried
the
Unicorn
,
as
Alice
sat
with
the
knife
*NL*
in
her
hand
,
very
much
puzzled
how
to
begin
.
`
The
Monster
has
given
the
*NL*
Lion
twice
as
much
as
me
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
kept
none
for
herself
,
anyhow
,
'
said
the
Lion
.
`
Do
you
like
*NL*
plum-cake
,
Monster
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
Alice
could
answer
him
,
the
drums
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
the
noise
came
from
,
she
could
n't
make
out
:
the
air
seemed
full
*NL*
of
it
,
and
it
rang
through
and
through
her
head
till
she
felt
quite
*NL*
deafened
.
She
started
to
her
feet
and
sprang
across
the
little
brook
in
*NL*
her
terror
,
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
and
had
just
time
to
see
the
Lion
and
the
Unicorn
rise
to
their
feet
,
*NL*
with
angry
looks
at
being
interrupted
in
their
feast
,
before
she
dropped
*NL*
to
her
knees
,
and
put
her
hands
over
her
ears
,
vainly
trying
to
shut
out
*NL*
the
dreadful
uproar
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
THAT
does
n't
``
drum
them
out
of
town
,
''
'
she
thought
to
herself
,
*NL*
`
nothing
ever
will
!

*NL*
CHAPTER
VIII
.
`
It
's
my
own
Invention
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
the
noise
seemed
gradually
to
die
away
,
till
all
was
dead
*NL*
silence
,
and
Alice
lifted
up
her
head
in
some
alarm
.
There
was
no
one
*NL*
to
be
seen
,
and
her
first
thought
was
that
she
must
have
been
dreaming
*NL*
about
the
Lion
and
the
Unicorn
and
those
queer
Anglo-Saxon
Messengers
.
*NL*
However
,
there
was
the
great
dish
still
lying
at
her
feet
,
on
which
she
*NL*
had
tried
to
cut
the
plum-cake
,
`
So
I
was
n't
dreaming
,
after
all
,
'
she
*NL*
said
to
herself
,
`
unless
--
unless
we
're
all
part
of
the
same
dream
.
Only
*NL*
I
do
hope
it
's
MY
dream
,
and
not
the
Red
King
's
!
I
do
n't
like
belonging
*NL*
to
another
person
's
dream
,
'
she
went
on
in
a
rather
complaining
tone
:
*NL*
`
I
've
a
great
mind
to
go
and
wake
him
,
and
see
what
happens
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
her
thoughts
were
interrupted
by
a
loud
shouting
of
*NL*
`
Ahoy
!
Ahoy
!
Check
!
'
and
a
Knight
dressed
in
crimson
armour
came
*NL*
galloping
down
upon
her
,
brandishing
a
great
club
.
Just
as
he
reached
*NL*
her
,
the
horse
stopped
suddenly
:
`
You
're
my
prisoner
!
'
the
Knight
cried
,
*NL*
as
he
tumbled
off
his
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Startled
as
she
was
,
Alice
was
more
frightened
for
him
than
for
herself
*NL*
at
the
moment
,
and
watched
him
with
some
anxiety
as
he
mounted
again
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
was
comfortably
in
the
saddle
,
he
began
once
more
`
You
're
*NL*
my
--
'
but
here
another
voice
broke
in
`
Ahoy
!
Ahoy
!
Check
!
'
and
Alice
*NL*
looked
round
in
some
surprise
for
the
new
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
it
was
a
White
Knight
.
He
drew
up
at
Alice
's
side
,
and
tumbled
*NL*
off
his
horse
just
as
the
Red
Knight
had
done
:
then
he
got
on
again
,
*NL*
and
the
two
Knights
sat
and
looked
at
each
other
for
some
time
without
*NL*
speaking
.
Alice
looked
from
one
to
the
other
in
some
bewilderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
MY
prisoner
,
you
know
!
'
the
Red
Knight
said
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
but
then
_
I
_
came
and
rescued
her
!
'
the
White
Knight
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
we
must
fight
for
her
,
then
,
'
said
the
Red
Knight
,
as
he
took
up
*NL*
his
helmet
-LRB-
which
hung
from
the
saddle
,
and
was
something
the
shape
of
a
*NL*
horse
's
head
-RRB-
,
and
put
it
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
observe
the
Rules
of
Battle
,
of
course
?
'
the
White
Knight
*NL*
remarked
,
putting
on
his
helmet
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
always
do
,
'
said
the
Red
Knight
,
and
they
began
banging
away
at
each
*NL*
other
with
such
fury
that
Alice
got
behind
a
tree
to
be
out
of
the
way
*NL*
of
the
blows
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wonder
,
now
,
what
the
Rules
of
Battle
are
,
'
she
said
to
herself
,
as
*NL*
she
watched
the
fight
,
timidly
peeping
out
from
her
hiding-place
:
`
one
*NL*
Rule
seems
to
be
,
that
if
one
Knight
hits
the
other
,
he
knocks
him
off
*NL*
his
horse
,
and
if
he
misses
,
he
tumbles
off
himself
--
and
another
Rule
*NL*
seems
to
be
that
they
hold
their
clubs
with
their
arms
,
as
if
they
were
*NL*
Punch
and
Judy
--
What
a
noise
they
make
when
they
tumble
!
Just
like
*NL*
a
whole
set
of
fire-irons
falling
into
the
fender
!
And
how
quiet
the
*NL*
horses
are
!
They
let
them
get
on
and
off
them
just
as
if
they
were
*NL*
tables
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Another
Rule
of
Battle
,
that
Alice
had
not
noticed
,
seemed
to
be
that
*NL*
they
always
fell
on
their
heads
,
and
the
battle
ended
with
their
both
*NL*
falling
off
in
this
way
,
side
by
side
:
when
they
got
up
again
,
they
*NL*
shook
hands
,
and
then
the
Red
Knight
mounted
and
galloped
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
a
glorious
victory
,
was
n't
it
?
'
said
the
White
Knight
,
as
he
*NL*
came
up
panting
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
,
'
Alice
said
doubtfully
.
'
I
do
n't
want
to
be
anybody
's
*NL*
prisoner
.
I
want
to
be
a
Queen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
you
will
,
when
you
've
crossed
the
next
brook
,
'
said
the
White
*NL*
Knight
.
`
I
'll
see
you
safe
to
the
end
of
the
wood
--
and
then
I
must
go
*NL*
back
,
you
know
.
That
's
the
end
of
my
move
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
very
much
,
'
said
Alice
.
`
May
I
help
you
off
with
your
*NL*
helmet
?
'
It
was
evidently
more
than
he
could
manage
by
himself
;
however
,
*NL*
she
managed
to
shake
him
out
of
it
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
one
can
breathe
more
easily
,
'
said
the
Knight
,
putting
back
his
*NL*
shaggy
hair
with
both
hands
,
and
turning
his
gentle
face
and
large
mild
*NL*
eyes
to
Alice
.
She
thought
she
had
never
seen
such
a
strange-looking
*NL*
soldier
in
all
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
dressed
in
tin
armour
,
which
seemed
to
fit
him
very
badly
,
and
*NL*
he
had
a
queer-shaped
little
deal
box
fastened
across
his
shoulder
,
*NL*
upside-down
,
and
with
the
lid
hanging
open
.
Alice
looked
at
it
with
*NL*
great
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
see
you
're
admiring
my
little
box
.
'
the
Knight
said
in
a
friendly
*NL*
tone
.
`
It
's
my
own
invention
--
to
keep
clothes
and
sandwiches
in
.
You
see
*NL*
I
carry
it
upside-down
,
so
that
the
rain
ca
n't
get
in
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
the
things
can
get
OUT
,
'
Alice
gently
remarked
.
`
Do
you
know
the
*NL*
lid
's
open
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
know
it
,
'
the
Knight
said
,
a
shade
of
vexation
passing
over
*NL*
his
face
.
`
Then
all
the
things
must
have
fallen
out
!
And
the
box
is
no
*NL*
use
without
them
.
'
He
unfastened
it
as
he
spoke
,
and
was
just
going
to
*NL*
throw
it
into
the
bushes
,
when
a
sudden
thought
seemed
to
strike
him
,
*NL*
and
he
hung
it
carefully
on
a
tree
.
`
Can
you
guess
why
I
did
that
?
'
he
*NL*
said
to
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
hopes
some
bees
may
make
a
nest
in
it
--
then
I
should
get
the
honey
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
you
've
got
a
bee-hive
--
or
something
like
one
--
fastened
to
the
*NL*
saddle
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
it
's
a
very
good
bee-hive
,
'
the
Knight
said
in
a
discontented
*NL*
tone
,
`
one
of
the
best
kind
.
But
not
a
single
bee
has
come
near
it
yet
.
*NL*
And
the
other
thing
is
a
mouse-trap
.
I
suppose
the
mice
keep
the
bees
*NL*
out
--
or
the
bees
keep
the
mice
out
,
I
do
n't
know
which
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
wondering
what
the
mouse-trap
was
for
,
'
said
Alice
.
`
It
is
n't
*NL*
very
likely
there
would
be
any
mice
on
the
horse
's
back
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
very
likely
,
perhaps
,
'
said
the
Knight
:
`
but
if
they
DO
come
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
choose
to
have
them
running
all
about
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
see
,
'
he
went
on
after
a
pause
,
`
it
's
as
well
to
be
provided
for
*NL*
EVERYTHING
.
That
's
the
reason
the
horse
has
all
those
anklets
round
his
*NL*
feet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
what
are
they
for
?
'
Alice
asked
in
a
tone
of
great
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
guard
against
the
bites
of
sharks
,
'
the
Knight
replied
.
`
It
's
an
*NL*
invention
of
my
own
.
And
now
help
me
on
.
I
'll
go
with
you
to
the
end
of
*NL*
the
wood
--
What
's
the
dish
for
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
meant
for
plum-cake
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
'd
better
take
it
with
us
,
'
the
Knight
said
.
`
It
'll
come
in
handy
if
*NL*
we
find
any
plum-cake
.
Help
me
to
get
it
into
this
bag
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
took
a
very
long
time
to
manage
,
though
Alice
held
the
bag
open
*NL*
very
carefully
,
because
the
Knight
was
so
VERY
awkward
in
putting
in
*NL*
the
dish
:
the
first
two
or
three
times
that
he
tried
he
fell
in
himself
*NL*
instead
.
`
It
's
rather
a
tight
fit
,
you
see
,
'
he
said
,
as
they
got
it
in
*NL*
a
last
;
`
There
are
so
many
candlesticks
in
the
bag
.
'
And
he
hung
it
*NL*
to
the
saddle
,
which
was
already
loaded
with
bunches
of
carrots
,
and
*NL*
fire-irons
,
and
many
other
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
you
've
got
your
hair
well
fastened
on
?
'
he
continued
,
as
they
*NL*
set
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Only
in
the
usual
way
,
'
Alice
said
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
hardly
enough
,
'
he
said
,
anxiously
.
`
You
see
the
wind
is
so
VERY
*NL*
strong
here
.
It
's
as
strong
as
soup
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Have
you
invented
a
plan
for
keeping
the
hair
from
being
blown
off
?
'
*NL*
Alice
enquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
yet
,
'
said
the
Knight
.
`
But
I
've
got
a
plan
for
keeping
it
from
*NL*
FALLING
off
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
should
like
to
hear
it
,
very
much
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
First
you
take
an
upright
stick
,
'
said
the
Knight
.
`
Then
you
make
your
*NL*
hair
creep
up
it
,
like
a
fruit-tree
.
Now
the
reason
hair
falls
off
is
*NL*
because
it
hangs
DOWN
--
things
never
fall
UPWARDS
,
you
know
.
It
's
a
plan
*NL*
of
my
own
invention
.
You
may
try
it
if
you
like
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
n't
sound
a
comfortable
plan
,
Alice
thought
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
*NL*
she
walked
on
in
silence
,
puzzling
over
the
idea
,
and
every
now
and
then
*NL*
stopping
to
help
the
poor
Knight
,
who
certainly
was
NOT
a
good
rider
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
the
horse
stopped
-LRB-
which
it
did
very
often
-RRB-
,
he
fell
off
in
*NL*
front
;
and
whenever
it
went
on
again
-LRB-
which
it
generally
did
rather
*NL*
suddenly
-RRB-
,
he
fell
off
behind
.
Otherwise
he
kept
on
pretty
well
,
except
*NL*
that
he
had
a
habit
of
now
and
then
falling
off
sideways
;
and
as
he
*NL*
generally
did
this
on
the
side
on
which
Alice
was
walking
,
she
soon
*NL*
found
that
it
was
the
best
plan
not
to
walk
QUITE
close
to
the
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
afraid
you
've
not
had
much
practice
in
riding
,
'
she
ventured
to
*NL*
say
,
as
she
was
helping
him
up
from
his
fifth
tumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
looked
very
much
surprised
,
and
a
little
offended
at
the
*NL*
remark
.
`
What
makes
you
say
that
?
'
he
asked
,
as
he
scrambled
back
into
*NL*
the
saddle
,
keeping
hold
of
Alice
's
hair
with
one
hand
,
to
save
himself
*NL*
from
falling
over
on
the
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
people
do
n't
fall
off
quite
so
often
,
when
they
've
had
much
*NL*
practice
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
've
had
plenty
of
practice
,
'
the
Knight
said
very
gravely
:
`
plenty
of
*NL*
practice
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
say
than
`
Indeed
?
'
but
she
said
*NL*
it
as
heartily
as
she
could
.
They
went
on
a
little
way
in
silence
after
*NL*
this
,
the
Knight
with
his
eyes
shut
,
muttering
to
himself
,
and
Alice
*NL*
watching
anxiously
for
the
next
tumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
great
art
of
riding
,
'
the
Knight
suddenly
began
in
a
loud
voice
,
*NL*
waving
his
right
arm
as
he
spoke
,
`
is
to
keep
--
'
Here
the
sentence
ended
*NL*
as
suddenly
as
it
had
begun
,
as
the
Knight
fell
heavily
on
the
top
of
*NL*
his
head
exactly
in
the
path
where
Alice
was
walking
.
She
was
quite
*NL*
frightened
this
time
,
and
said
in
an
anxious
tone
,
as
she
picked
him
up
,
*NL*
'
I
hope
no
bones
are
broken
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
None
to
speak
of
,
'
the
Knight
said
,
as
if
he
did
n't
mind
breaking
two
*NL*
or
three
of
them
.
`
The
great
art
of
riding
,
as
I
was
saying
,
is
--
to
keep
*NL*
your
balance
properly
.
Like
this
,
you
know
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
let
go
the
bridle
,
and
stretched
out
both
his
arms
to
show
Alice
*NL*
what
he
meant
,
and
this
time
he
fell
flat
on
his
back
,
right
under
the
*NL*
horse
's
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Plenty
of
practice
!
'
he
went
on
repeating
,
all
the
time
that
Alice
was
*NL*
getting
him
on
his
feet
again
.
`
Plenty
of
practice
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
too
ridiculous
!
'
cried
Alice
,
losing
all
her
patience
this
time
.
*NL*
`
You
ought
to
have
a
wooden
horse
on
wheels
,
that
you
ought
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Does
that
kind
go
smoothly
?
'
the
Knight
asked
in
a
tone
of
great
*NL*
interest
,
clasping
his
arms
round
the
horse
's
neck
as
he
spoke
,
just
in
*NL*
time
to
save
himself
from
tumbling
off
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Much
more
smoothly
than
a
live
horse
,
'
Alice
said
,
with
a
little
scream
*NL*
of
laughter
,
in
spite
of
all
she
could
do
to
prevent
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
get
one
,
'
the
Knight
said
thoughtfully
to
himself
.
`
One
or
*NL*
two
--
several
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
short
silence
after
this
,
and
then
the
Knight
went
on
again
.
*NL*
`
I
'm
a
great
hand
at
inventing
things
.
Now
,
I
daresay
you
noticed
,
that
*NL*
last
time
you
picked
me
up
,
that
I
was
looking
rather
thoughtful
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
WERE
a
little
grave
,
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
just
then
I
was
inventing
a
new
way
of
getting
over
a
gate
--
would
*NL*
you
like
to
hear
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
much
indeed
,
'
Alice
said
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
you
how
I
came
to
think
of
it
,
'
said
the
Knight
.
`
You
see
,
I
*NL*
said
to
myself
,
``
The
only
difficulty
is
with
the
feet
:
the
HEAD
is
high
*NL*
enough
already
.
''
Now
,
first
I
put
my
head
on
the
top
of
the
gate
--
then
I
*NL*
stand
on
my
head
--
then
the
feet
are
high
enough
,
you
see
--
then
I
'm
over
,
*NL*
you
see
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
I
suppose
you
'd
be
over
when
that
was
done
,
'
Alice
said
*NL*
thoughtfully
:
`
but
do
n't
you
think
it
would
be
rather
hard
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
n't
tried
it
yet
,
'
the
Knight
said
,
gravely
:
`
so
I
ca
n't
tell
for
*NL*
certain
--
but
I
'm
afraid
it
WOULD
be
a
little
hard
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
so
vexed
at
the
idea
,
that
Alice
changed
the
subject
hastily
.
*NL*
`
What
a
curious
helmet
you
've
got
!
'
she
said
cheerfully
.
`
Is
that
your
*NL*
invention
too
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
looked
down
proudly
at
his
helmet
,
which
hung
from
the
*NL*
saddle
.
`
Yes
,
'
he
said
,
`
but
I
've
invented
a
better
one
than
that
--
like
*NL*
a
sugar
loaf
.
When
I
used
to
wear
it
,
if
I
fell
off
the
horse
,
it
always
*NL*
touched
the
ground
directly
.
So
I
had
a
VERY
little
way
to
fall
,
you
*NL*
see
--
But
there
WAS
the
danger
of
falling
INTO
it
,
to
be
sure
.
That
*NL*
happened
to
me
once
--
and
the
worst
of
it
was
,
before
I
could
get
out
*NL*
again
,
the
other
White
Knight
came
and
put
it
on
.
He
thought
it
was
his
*NL*
own
helmet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
knight
looked
so
solemn
about
it
that
Alice
did
not
dare
to
laugh
.
*NL*
`
I
'm
afraid
you
must
have
hurt
him
,
'
she
said
in
a
trembling
voice
,
*NL*
`
being
on
the
top
of
his
head
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
had
to
kick
him
,
of
course
,
'
the
Knight
said
,
very
seriously
.
`
And
*NL*
then
he
took
the
helmet
off
again
--
but
it
took
hours
and
hours
to
get
me
*NL*
out
.
I
was
as
fast
as
--
as
lightning
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
that
's
a
different
kind
of
fastness
,
'
Alice
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
shook
his
head
.
`
It
was
all
kinds
of
fastness
with
me
,
I
can
*NL*
assure
you
!
'
he
said
.
He
raised
his
hands
in
some
excitement
as
he
said
*NL*
this
,
and
instantly
rolled
out
of
the
saddle
,
and
fell
headlong
into
a
*NL*
deep
ditch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
ran
to
the
side
of
the
ditch
to
look
for
him
.
She
was
rather
*NL*
startled
by
the
fall
,
as
for
some
time
he
had
kept
on
very
well
,
and
she
*NL*
was
afraid
that
he
really
WAS
hurt
this
time
.
However
,
though
she
could
*NL*
see
nothing
but
the
soles
of
his
feet
,
she
was
much
relieved
to
hear
*NL*
that
he
was
talking
on
in
his
usual
tone
.
`
All
kinds
of
fastness
,
'
*NL*
he
repeated
:
`
but
it
was
careless
of
him
to
put
another
man
's
helmet
*NL*
on
--
with
the
man
in
it
,
too
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
CAN
you
go
on
talking
so
quietly
,
head
downwards
?
'
Alice
asked
,
as
*NL*
she
dragged
him
out
by
the
feet
,
and
laid
him
in
a
heap
on
the
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Knight
looked
surprised
at
the
question
.
`
What
does
it
matter
where
*NL*
my
body
happens
to
be
?
'
he
said
.
`
My
mind
goes
on
working
all
the
same
.
*NL*
In
fact
,
the
more
head
downwards
I
am
,
the
more
I
keep
inventing
new
*NL*
things
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
the
cleverest
thing
of
the
sort
that
I
ever
did
,
'
he
went
on
after
*NL*
a
pause
,
`
was
inventing
a
new
pudding
during
the
meat-course
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
time
to
have
it
cooked
for
the
next
course
?
'
said
Alice
.
`
Well
,
*NL*
not
the
NEXT
course
,
'
the
Knight
said
in
a
slow
thoughtful
tone
:
`
no
,
*NL*
certainly
not
the
next
COURSE
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
it
would
have
to
be
the
next
day
.
I
suppose
you
would
n't
have
two
*NL*
pudding-courses
in
one
dinner
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
not
the
NEXT
day
,
'
the
Knight
repeated
as
before
:
`
not
the
next
*NL*
DAY
.
In
fact
,
'
he
went
on
,
holding
his
head
down
,
and
his
voice
getting
*NL*
lower
and
lower
,
'
I
do
n't
believe
that
pudding
ever
WAS
cooked
!
In
fact
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
believe
that
pudding
ever
WILL
be
cooked
!
And
yet
it
was
a
very
*NL*
clever
pudding
to
invent
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
did
you
mean
it
to
be
made
of
?
'
Alice
asked
,
hoping
to
cheer
him
*NL*
up
,
for
the
poor
Knight
seemed
quite
low-spirited
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
began
with
blotting
paper
,
'
the
Knight
answered
with
a
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
would
n't
be
very
nice
,
I
'm
afraid
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
very
nice
ALONE
,
'
he
interrupted
,
quite
eagerly
:
`
but
you
've
no
*NL*
idea
what
a
difference
it
makes
mixing
it
with
other
things
--
such
as
*NL*
gunpowder
and
sealing-wax
.
And
here
I
must
leave
you
.
'
They
had
just
*NL*
come
to
the
end
of
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
could
only
look
puzzled
:
she
was
thinking
of
the
pudding
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
sad
,
'
the
Knight
said
in
an
anxious
tone
:
`
let
me
sing
you
a
*NL*
song
to
comfort
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
it
very
long
?
'
Alice
asked
,
for
she
had
heard
a
good
deal
of
poetry
*NL*
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
long
,
'
said
the
Knight
,
`
but
very
,
VERY
beautiful
.
Everybody
that
*NL*
hears
me
sing
it
--
either
it
brings
the
TEARS
into
their
eyes
,
or
else
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Or
else
what
?
'
said
Alice
,
for
the
Knight
had
made
a
sudden
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Or
else
it
does
n't
,
you
know
.
The
name
of
the
song
is
called
``
HADDOCKS
'
*NL*
EYES
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
that
's
the
name
of
the
song
,
is
it
?
'
Alice
said
,
trying
to
feel
*NL*
interested
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
you
do
n't
understand
,
'
the
Knight
said
,
looking
a
little
vexed
.
*NL*
`
That
's
what
the
name
is
CALLED
.
The
name
really
IS
``
THE
AGED
AGED
*NL*
MAN
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
ought
to
have
said
``
That
's
what
the
SONG
is
called
''
?
'
Alice
*NL*
corrected
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
you
ought
n't
:
that
's
quite
another
thing
!
The
SONG
is
called
``
WAYS
*NL*
AND
MEANS
''
:
but
that
's
only
what
it
's
CALLED
,
you
know
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
what
IS
the
song
,
then
?
'
said
Alice
,
who
was
by
this
time
*NL*
completely
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
coming
to
that
,
'
the
Knight
said
.
`
The
song
really
IS
``
A-SITTING
*NL*
ON
A
GATE
''
:
and
the
tune
's
my
own
invention
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
stopped
his
horse
and
let
the
reins
fall
on
its
neck
:
*NL*
then
,
slowly
beating
time
with
one
hand
,
and
with
a
faint
smile
lighting
*NL*
up
his
gentle
foolish
face
,
as
if
he
enjoyed
the
music
of
his
song
,
he
*NL*
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
the
strange
things
that
Alice
saw
in
her
journey
Through
The
*NL*
Looking-Glass
,
this
was
the
one
that
she
always
remembered
most
clearly
.
*NL*
Years
afterwards
she
could
bring
the
whole
scene
back
again
,
as
if
it
*NL*
had
been
only
yesterday
--
the
mild
blue
eyes
and
kindly
smile
of
the
*NL*
Knight
--
the
setting
sun
gleaming
through
his
hair
,
and
shining
on
his
*NL*
armour
in
a
blaze
of
light
that
quite
dazzled
her
--
the
horse
quietly
*NL*
moving
about
,
with
the
reins
hanging
loose
on
his
neck
,
cropping
the
*NL*
grass
at
her
feet
--
and
the
black
shadows
of
the
forest
behind
--
all
this
*NL*
she
took
in
like
a
picture
,
as
,
with
one
hand
shading
her
eyes
,
she
*NL*
leant
against
a
tree
,
watching
the
strange
pair
,
and
listening
,
in
a
*NL*
half
dream
,
to
the
melancholy
music
of
the
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
the
tune
IS
N'T
his
own
invention
,
'
she
said
to
herself
:
`
it
's
``
I
*NL*
GIVE
THEE
ALL
,
I
CAN
NO
MORE
.
''
'
She
stood
and
listened
very
attentively
,
*NL*
but
no
tears
came
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
tell
thee
everything
I
can
;
*NL*
There
's
little
to
relate
.
*NL*
I
saw
an
aged
aged
man
,
*NL*
A-sitting
on
a
gate
.
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
,
aged
man
?
''
I
said
,
*NL*
``
and
how
is
it
you
live
?
''
*NL*
And
his
answer
trickled
through
my
head
*NL*
Like
water
through
a
sieve
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
``
I
look
for
butterflies
*NL*
That
sleep
among
the
wheat
:
*NL*
I
make
them
into
mutton-pies
,
*NL*
And
sell
them
in
the
street
.
*NL*
I
sell
them
unto
men
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Who
sail
on
stormy
seas
;
*NL*
And
that
's
the
way
I
get
my
bread
--
*NL*
A
trifle
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
thinking
of
a
plan
*NL*
To
dye
one
's
whiskers
green
,
*NL*
And
always
use
so
large
a
fan
*NL*
That
they
could
not
be
seen
.
*NL*
So
,
having
no
reply
to
give
*NL*
To
what
the
old
man
said
,
*NL*
I
cried
,
``
Come
,
tell
me
how
you
live
!
''
*NL*
And
thumped
him
on
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
accents
mild
took
up
the
tale
:
*NL*
He
said
``
I
go
my
ways
,
*NL*
And
when
I
find
a
mountain-rill
,
*NL*
I
set
it
in
a
blaze
;
*NL*
And
thence
they
make
a
stuff
they
call
*NL*
Rolands
'
Macassar
Oil
--
*NL*
Yet
twopence-halfpenny
is
all
*NL*
They
give
me
for
my
toil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
thinking
of
a
way
*NL*
To
feed
oneself
on
batter
,
*NL*
And
so
go
on
from
day
to
day
*NL*
Getting
a
little
fatter
.
*NL*
I
shook
him
well
from
side
to
side
,
*NL*
Until
his
face
was
blue
:
*NL*
``
Come
,
tell
me
how
you
live
,
''
I
cried
,
*NL*
``
And
what
it
is
you
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
``
I
hunt
for
haddocks
'
eyes
*NL*
Among
the
heather
bright
,
*NL*
And
work
them
into
waistcoat-buttons
*NL*
In
the
silent
night
.
*NL*
And
these
I
do
not
sell
for
gold
*NL*
Or
coin
of
silvery
shine
*NL*
But
for
a
copper
halfpenny
,
*NL*
And
that
will
purchase
nine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sometimes
dig
for
buttered
rolls
,
*NL*
Or
set
limed
twigs
for
crabs
;
*NL*
I
sometimes
search
the
grassy
knolls
*NL*
For
wheels
of
Hansom-cabs
.
*NL*
And
that
's
the
way
''
-LRB-
he
gave
a
wink
-RRB-
*NL*
``
By
which
I
get
my
wealth
--
*NL*
And
very
gladly
will
I
drink
*NL*
Your
Honour
's
noble
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
him
then
,
for
I
had
just
*NL*
Completed
my
design
*NL*
To
keep
the
Menai
bridge
from
rust
*NL*
By
boiling
it
in
wine
.
*NL*
I
thanked
him
much
for
telling
me
*NL*
The
way
he
got
his
wealth
,
*NL*
But
chiefly
for
his
wish
that
he
*NL*
Might
drink
my
noble
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
if
e'er
by
chance
I
put
*NL*
My
fingers
into
glue
*NL*
Or
madly
squeeze
a
right-hand
foot
*NL*
Into
a
left-hand
shoe
,
*NL*
Or
if
I
drop
upon
my
toe
*NL*
A
very
heavy
weight
,
*NL*
I
weep
,
for
it
reminds
me
so
,
*NL*
Of
that
old
man
I
used
to
know
--
*NL*
*NL*
Whose
look
was
mild
,
whose
speech
was
slow
,
*NL*
Whose
hair
was
whiter
than
the
snow
,
*NL*
Whose
face
was
very
like
a
crow
,
*NL*
With
eyes
,
like
cinders
,
all
aglow
,
*NL*
Who
seemed
distracted
with
his
woe
,
*NL*
Who
rocked
his
body
to
and
fro
,
*NL*
And
muttered
mumblingly
and
low
,
*NL*
As
if
his
mouth
were
full
of
dough
,
*NL*
Who
snorted
like
a
buffalo
--
*NL*
That
summer
evening
,
long
ago
,
*NL*
A-sitting
on
a
gate
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Knight
sang
the
last
words
of
the
ballad
,
he
gathered
up
the
*NL*
reins
,
and
turned
his
horse
's
head
along
the
road
by
which
they
had
*NL*
come
.
`
You
've
only
a
few
yards
to
go
,
'
he
said
,
`
down
the
hill
and
over
*NL*
that
little
brook
,
and
then
you
'll
be
a
Queen
--
But
you
'll
stay
and
*NL*
see
me
off
first
?
'
he
added
as
Alice
turned
with
an
eager
look
in
the
*NL*
direction
to
which
he
pointed
.
'
I
sha
n't
be
long
.
You
'll
wait
and
wave
*NL*
your
handkerchief
when
I
get
to
that
turn
in
the
road
?
I
think
it
'll
*NL*
encourage
me
,
you
see
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
I
'll
wait
,
'
said
Alice
:
`
and
thank
you
very
much
for
coming
*NL*
so
far
--
and
for
the
song
--
I
liked
it
very
much
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
so
,
'
the
Knight
said
doubtfully
:
`
but
you
did
n't
cry
so
much
as
*NL*
I
thought
you
would
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
shook
hands
,
and
then
the
Knight
rode
slowly
away
into
the
*NL*
forest
.
`
It
wo
n't
take
long
to
see
him
OFF
,
I
expect
,
'
Alice
said
to
*NL*
herself
,
as
she
stood
watching
him
.
`
There
he
goes
!
Right
on
his
head
as
*NL*
usual
!
However
,
he
gets
on
again
pretty
easily
--
that
comes
of
having
so
*NL*
many
things
hung
round
the
horse
--
'
So
she
went
on
talking
to
herself
,
*NL*
as
she
watched
the
horse
walking
leisurely
along
the
road
,
and
the
*NL*
Knight
tumbling
off
,
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
.
After
*NL*
the
fourth
or
fifth
tumble
he
reached
the
turn
,
and
then
she
waved
her
*NL*
handkerchief
to
him
,
and
waited
till
he
was
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
hope
it
encouraged
him
,
'
she
said
,
as
she
turned
to
run
down
the
*NL*
hill
:
`
and
now
for
the
last
brook
,
and
to
be
a
Queen
!
How
grand
it
*NL*
sounds
!
'
A
very
few
steps
brought
her
to
the
edge
of
the
brook
.
`
The
*NL*
Eighth
Square
at
last
!
'
she
cried
as
she
bounded
across
,
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
and
threw
herself
down
to
rest
on
a
lawn
as
soft
as
moss
,
with
little
*NL*
flower-beds
dotted
about
it
here
and
there
.
`
Oh
,
how
glad
I
am
to
get
*NL*
here
!
And
what
IS
this
on
my
head
?
'
she
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
dismay
,
*NL*
as
she
put
her
hands
up
to
something
very
heavy
,
and
fitted
tight
all
*NL*
round
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
how
CAN
it
have
got
there
without
my
knowing
it
?
'
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
,
as
she
lifted
it
off
,
and
set
it
on
her
lap
to
make
out
what
it
*NL*
could
possibly
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
golden
crown
.

CHAPTER
IX
.
Queen
Alice
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
this
IS
grand
!
'
said
Alice
.
'
I
never
expected
I
should
be
a
Queen
*NL*
so
soon
--
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
your
majesty
,
'
she
went
on
in
*NL*
a
severe
tone
-LRB-
she
was
always
rather
fond
of
scolding
herself
-RRB-
,
`
it
'll
*NL*
never
do
for
you
to
be
lolling
about
on
the
grass
like
that
!
Queens
have
*NL*
to
be
dignified
,
you
know
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
got
up
and
walked
about
--
rather
stiffly
just
at
first
,
as
she
was
*NL*
afraid
that
the
crown
might
come
off
:
but
she
comforted
herself
with
the
*NL*
thought
that
there
was
nobody
to
see
her
,
`
and
if
I
really
am
a
Queen
,
'
*NL*
she
said
as
she
sat
down
again
,
'
I
shall
be
able
to
manage
it
quite
well
*NL*
in
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
happening
so
oddly
that
she
did
n't
feel
a
bit
surprised
*NL*
at
finding
the
Red
Queen
and
the
White
Queen
sitting
close
to
her
,
one
*NL*
on
each
side
:
she
would
have
liked
very
much
to
ask
them
how
they
came
*NL*
there
,
but
she
feared
it
would
not
be
quite
civil
.
However
,
there
would
*NL*
be
no
harm
,
she
thought
,
in
asking
if
the
game
was
over
.
`
Please
,
would
*NL*
you
tell
me
--
'
she
began
,
looking
timidly
at
the
Red
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Speak
when
you
're
spoken
to
!
'
The
Queen
sharply
interrupted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
if
everybody
obeyed
that
rule
,
'
said
Alice
,
who
was
always
ready
*NL*
for
a
little
argument
,
`
and
if
you
only
spoke
when
you
were
spoken
to
,
*NL*
and
the
other
person
always
waited
for
YOU
to
begin
,
you
see
nobody
*NL*
would
ever
say
anything
,
so
that
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ridiculous
!
'
cried
the
Queen
.
`
Why
,
do
n't
you
see
,
child
--
'
here
she
*NL*
broke
off
with
a
frown
,
and
,
after
thinking
for
a
minute
,
suddenly
*NL*
changed
the
subject
of
the
conversation
.
`
What
do
you
mean
by
``
If
you
*NL*
really
are
a
Queen
''
?
What
right
have
you
to
call
yourself
so
?
You
ca
n't
*NL*
be
a
Queen
,
you
know
,
till
you
've
passed
the
proper
examination
.
And
the
*NL*
sooner
we
begin
it
,
the
better
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
only
said
``
if
''
!
'
poor
Alice
pleaded
in
a
piteous
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
Queens
looked
at
each
other
,
and
the
Red
Queen
remarked
,
with
a
*NL*
little
shudder
,
`
She
SAYS
she
only
said
``
if
''
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
she
said
a
great
deal
more
than
that
!
'
the
White
Queen
moaned
,
*NL*
wringing
her
hands
.
`
Oh
,
ever
so
much
more
than
that
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
you
did
,
you
know
,
'
the
Red
Queen
said
to
Alice
.
`
Always
speak
the
*NL*
truth
--
think
before
you
speak
--
and
write
it
down
afterwards
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
sure
I
did
n't
mean
--
'
Alice
was
beginning
,
but
the
Red
Queen
*NL*
interrupted
her
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
just
what
I
complain
of
!
You
SHOULD
have
meant
!
What
do
you
*NL*
suppose
is
the
use
of
child
without
any
meaning
?
Even
a
joke
should
*NL*
have
some
meaning
--
and
a
child
's
more
important
than
a
joke
,
I
hope
.
You
*NL*
could
n't
deny
that
,
even
if
you
tried
with
both
hands
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
deny
things
with
my
HANDS
,
'
Alice
objected
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nobody
said
you
did
,
'
said
the
Red
Queen
.
'
I
said
you
could
n't
if
you
*NL*
tried
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
in
that
state
of
mind
,
'
said
the
White
Queen
,
`
that
she
wants
to
*NL*
deny
SOMETHING
--
only
she
does
n't
know
what
to
deny
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
nasty
,
vicious
temper
,
'
the
Red
Queen
remarked
;
and
then
there
was
an
*NL*
uncomfortable
silence
for
a
minute
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Red
Queen
broke
the
silence
by
saying
to
the
White
Queen
,
'
I
invite
*NL*
you
to
Alice
's
dinner-party
this
afternoon
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
White
Queen
smiled
feebly
,
and
said
`
And
I
invite
YOU
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
know
I
was
to
have
a
party
at
all
,
'
said
Alice
;
`
but
if
there
*NL*
is
to
be
one
,
I
think
_
I
_
ought
to
invite
the
guests
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
gave
you
the
opportunity
of
doing
it
,
'
the
Red
Queen
remarked
:
`
but
*NL*
I
daresay
you
've
not
had
many
lessons
in
manners
yet
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Manners
are
not
taught
in
lessons
,
'
said
Alice
.
`
Lessons
teach
you
to
*NL*
do
sums
,
and
things
of
that
sort
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
do
Addition
?
'
the
White
Queen
asked
.
`
What
's
one
and
one
and
*NL*
one
and
one
and
one
and
one
and
one
and
one
and
one
and
one
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
,
'
said
Alice
.
'
I
lost
count
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
ca
n't
do
Addition
,
'
the
Red
Queen
interrupted
.
`
Can
you
do
*NL*
Subtraction
?
Take
nine
from
eight
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nine
from
eight
I
ca
n't
,
you
know
,
'
Alice
replied
very
readily
:
`
but
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
ca
n't
do
Subtraction
,
'
said
the
White
Queen
.
`
Can
you
do
Division
?
*NL*
Divide
a
loaf
by
a
knife
--
what
's
the
answer
to
that
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
--
'
Alice
was
beginning
,
but
the
Red
Queen
answered
for
her
.
*NL*
`
Bread-and-butter
,
of
course
.
Try
another
Subtraction
sum
.
Take
a
bone
*NL*
from
a
dog
:
what
remains
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
considered
.
`
The
bone
would
n't
remain
,
of
course
,
if
I
took
*NL*
it
--
and
the
dog
would
n't
remain
;
it
would
come
to
bite
me
--
and
I
'm
sure
*NL*
I
should
n't
remain
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
you
think
nothing
would
remain
?
'
said
the
Red
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
that
's
the
answer
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Wrong
,
as
usual
,
'
said
the
Red
Queen
:
`
the
dog
's
temper
would
remain
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
do
n't
see
how
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
look
here
!
'
the
Red
Queen
cried
.
`
The
dog
would
lose
its
temper
,
*NL*
would
n't
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
it
would
,
'
Alice
replied
cautiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
if
the
dog
went
away
,
its
temper
would
remain
!
'
the
Queen
*NL*
exclaimed
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
said
,
as
gravely
as
she
could
,
`
They
might
go
different
ways
.
'
But
*NL*
she
could
n't
help
thinking
to
herself
,
`
What
dreadful
nonsense
we
ARE
*NL*
talking
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
ca
n't
do
sums
a
BIT
!
'
the
Queens
said
together
,
with
great
*NL*
emphasis
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Can
YOU
do
sums
?
'
Alice
said
,
turning
suddenly
on
the
White
Queen
,
for
*NL*
she
did
n't
like
being
found
fault
with
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Queen
gasped
and
shut
her
eyes
.
'
I
can
do
Addition
,
if
you
give
me
*NL*
time
--
but
I
ca
n't
do
Subtraction
,
under
ANY
circumstances
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
you
know
your
A
B
C
?
'
said
the
Red
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
be
sure
I
do
.
'
said
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
do
I
,
'
the
White
Queen
whispered
:
`
we
'll
often
say
it
over
together
,
*NL*
dear
.
And
I
'll
tell
you
a
secret
--
I
can
read
words
of
one
letter
!
Is
n't
*NL*
THAT
grand
!
However
,
do
n't
be
discouraged
.
You
'll
come
to
it
in
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
Red
Queen
began
again
.
`
Can
you
answer
useful
questions
?
'
she
*NL*
said
.
`
How
is
bread
made
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
THAT
!
'
Alice
cried
eagerly
.
`
You
take
some
flour
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
do
you
pick
the
flower
?
'
the
White
Queen
asked
.
`
In
a
garden
,
or
*NL*
in
the
hedges
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
it
is
n't
PICKED
at
all
,
'
Alice
explained
:
`
it
's
GROUND
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
many
acres
of
ground
?
'
said
the
White
Queen
.
`
You
must
n't
leave
out
*NL*
so
many
things
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fan
her
head
!
'
the
Red
Queen
anxiously
interrupted
.
`
She
'll
be
feverish
*NL*
after
so
much
thinking
.
'
So
they
set
to
work
and
fanned
her
with
bunches
*NL*
of
leaves
,
till
she
had
to
beg
them
to
leave
off
,
it
blew
her
hair
about
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
all
right
again
now
,
'
said
the
Red
Queen
.
`
Do
you
know
Languages
?
*NL*
What
's
the
French
for
fiddle-de-dee
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fiddle-de-dee
's
not
English
,
'
Alice
replied
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
ever
said
it
was
?
'
said
the
Red
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
thought
she
saw
a
way
out
of
the
difficulty
this
time
.
`
If
you
'll
*NL*
tell
me
what
language
``
fiddle-de-dee
''
is
,
I
'll
tell
you
the
French
for
*NL*
it
!
'
she
exclaimed
triumphantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Red
Queen
drew
herself
up
rather
stiffly
,
and
said
`
Queens
never
*NL*
make
bargains
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wish
Queens
never
asked
questions
,
'
Alice
thought
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
let
us
quarrel
,
'
the
White
Queen
said
in
an
anxious
tone
.
`
What
*NL*
is
the
cause
of
lightning
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
cause
of
lightning
,
'
Alice
said
very
decidedly
,
for
she
felt
quite
*NL*
certain
about
this
,
`
is
the
thunder
--
no
,
no
!
'
she
hastily
corrected
*NL*
herself
.
'
I
meant
the
other
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
too
late
to
correct
it
,
'
said
the
Red
Queen
:
`
when
you
've
once
*NL*
said
a
thing
,
that
fixes
it
,
and
you
must
take
the
consequences
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Which
reminds
me
--
'
the
White
Queen
said
,
looking
down
and
nervously
*NL*
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
,
`
we
had
SUCH
a
thunderstorm
last
*NL*
Tuesday
--
I
mean
one
of
the
last
set
of
Tuesdays
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
was
puzzled
.
`
In
OUR
country
,
'
she
remarked
,
`
there
's
only
one
day
*NL*
at
a
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Red
Queen
said
,
`
That
's
a
poor
thin
way
of
doing
things
.
Now
HERE
,
*NL*
we
mostly
have
days
and
nights
two
or
three
at
a
time
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
in
the
winter
we
take
as
many
as
five
nights
together
--
for
warmth
,
you
*NL*
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
five
nights
warmer
than
one
night
,
then
?
'
Alice
ventured
to
ask
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Five
times
as
warm
,
of
course
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
they
should
be
five
times
as
COLD
,
by
the
same
rule
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Just
so
!
'
cried
the
Red
Queen
.
`
Five
times
as
warm
,
AND
five
times
*NL*
as
cold
--
just
as
I
'm
five
times
as
rich
as
you
are
,
AND
five
times
as
*NL*
clever
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
sighed
and
gave
it
up
.
`
It
's
exactly
like
a
riddle
with
no
*NL*
answer
!
'
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Humpty
Dumpty
saw
it
too
,
'
the
White
Queen
went
on
in
a
low
voice
,
more
*NL*
as
if
she
were
talking
to
herself
.
`
He
came
to
the
door
with
a
corkscrew
*NL*
in
his
hand
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
did
he
want
?
'
said
the
Red
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
said
he
WOULD
come
in
,
'
the
White
Queen
went
on
,
`
because
he
was
*NL*
looking
for
a
hippopotamus
.
Now
,
as
it
happened
,
there
was
n't
such
a
*NL*
thing
in
the
house
,
that
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
there
generally
?
'
Alice
asked
in
an
astonished
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
only
on
Thursdays
,
'
said
the
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
what
he
came
for
,
'
said
Alice
:
`
he
wanted
to
punish
the
fish
,
*NL*
because
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
White
Queen
began
again
.
`
It
was
SUCH
a
thunderstorm
,
you
ca
n't
*NL*
think
!
'
-LRB-
`
She
NEVER
could
,
you
know
,
'
said
the
Red
Queen
.
-RRB-
`
And
part
of
*NL*
the
roof
came
off
,
and
ever
so
much
thunder
got
in
--
and
it
went
*NL*
rolling
round
the
room
in
great
lumps
--
and
knocking
over
the
tables
and
*NL*
things
--
till
I
was
so
frightened
,
I
could
n't
remember
my
own
name
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
thought
to
herself
,
'
I
never
should
TRY
to
remember
my
name
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
an
accident
!
Where
would
be
the
use
of
it
?
'
but
she
did
not
*NL*
say
this
aloud
,
for
fear
of
hurting
the
poor
Queen
's
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
Majesty
must
excuse
her
,
'
the
Red
Queen
said
to
Alice
,
taking
*NL*
one
of
the
White
Queen
's
hands
in
her
own
,
and
gently
stroking
it
:
*NL*
`
she
means
well
,
but
she
ca
n't
help
saying
foolish
things
,
as
a
general
*NL*
rule
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
White
Queen
looked
timidly
at
Alice
,
who
felt
she
OUGHT
to
say
*NL*
something
kind
,
but
really
could
n't
think
of
anything
at
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
never
was
really
well
brought
up
,
'
the
Red
Queen
went
on
:
`
but
*NL*
it
's
amazing
how
good-tempered
she
is
!
Pat
her
on
the
head
,
and
see
how
*NL*
pleased
she
'll
be
!
'
But
this
was
more
than
Alice
had
courage
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
little
kindness
--
and
putting
her
hair
in
papers
--
would
do
wonders
*NL*
with
her
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
White
Queen
gave
a
deep
sigh
,
and
laid
her
head
on
Alice
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
'
I
AM
so
sleepy
?
'
she
moaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
's
tired
,
poor
thing
!
'
said
the
Red
Queen
.
`
Smooth
her
hair
--
lend
*NL*
her
your
nightcap
--
and
sing
her
a
soothing
lullaby
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
n't
got
a
nightcap
with
me
,
'
said
Alice
,
as
she
tried
to
obey
the
*NL*
first
direction
:
`
and
I
do
n't
know
any
soothing
lullabies
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
must
do
it
myself
,
then
,
'
said
the
Red
Queen
,
and
she
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hush-a-by
lady
,
in
Alice
's
lap
!
*NL*
Till
the
feast
's
ready
,
we
've
time
for
a
nap
:
*NL*
When
the
feast
's
over
,
we
'll
go
to
the
ball
--
*NL*
Red
Queen
,
and
White
Queen
,
and
Alice
,
and
all
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
now
you
know
the
words
,
'
she
added
,
as
she
put
her
head
down
on
*NL*
Alice
's
other
shoulder
,
`
just
sing
it
through
to
ME
.
I
'm
getting
sleepy
,
*NL*
too
.
'
In
another
moment
both
Queens
were
fast
asleep
,
and
snoring
loud
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
AM
I
to
do
?
'
exclaimed
Alice
,
looking
about
in
great
perplexity
,
*NL*
as
first
one
round
head
,
and
then
the
other
,
rolled
down
from
her
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
lay
like
a
heavy
lump
in
her
lap
.
'
I
do
n't
think
it
EVER
*NL*
happened
before
,
that
any
one
had
to
take
care
of
two
Queens
asleep
*NL*
at
once
!
No
,
not
in
all
the
History
of
England
--
it
could
n't
,
you
know
,
*NL*
because
there
never
was
more
than
one
Queen
at
a
time
.
Do
wake
up
,
you
*NL*
heavy
things
!
'
she
went
on
in
an
impatient
tone
;
but
there
was
no
answer
*NL*
but
a
gentle
snoring
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
snoring
got
more
distinct
every
minute
,
and
sounded
more
like
a
*NL*
tune
:
at
last
she
could
even
make
out
the
words
,
and
she
listened
so
*NL*
eagerly
that
,
when
the
two
great
heads
vanished
from
her
lap
,
she
hardly
*NL*
missed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
standing
before
an
arched
doorway
over
which
were
the
words
*NL*
QUEEN
ALICE
in
large
letters
,
and
on
each
side
of
the
arch
there
was
a
*NL*
bell-handle
;
one
was
marked
`
Visitors
'
Bell
,
'
and
the
other
`
Servants
'
*NL*
Bell
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'll
wait
till
the
song
's
over
,
'
thought
Alice
,
`
and
then
I
'll
*NL*
ring
--
the
--
WHICH
bell
must
I
ring
?
'
she
went
on
,
very
much
puzzled
by
*NL*
the
names
.
`
I
'm
not
a
visitor
,
and
I
'm
not
a
servant
.
There
OUGHT
to
be
*NL*
one
marked
``
Queen
,
''
you
know
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
the
door
opened
a
little
way
,
and
a
creature
with
a
long
beak
*NL*
put
its
head
out
for
a
moment
and
said
`
No
admittance
till
the
week
*NL*
after
next
!
'
and
shut
the
door
again
with
a
bang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
knocked
and
rang
in
vain
for
a
long
time
,
but
at
last
,
a
very
old
*NL*
Frog
,
who
was
sitting
under
a
tree
,
got
up
and
hobbled
slowly
towards
*NL*
her
:
he
was
dressed
in
bright
yellow
,
and
had
enormous
boots
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
is
it
,
now
?
'
the
Frog
said
in
a
deep
hoarse
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
turned
round
,
ready
to
find
fault
with
anybody
.
`
Where
's
the
*NL*
servant
whose
business
it
is
to
answer
the
door
?
'
she
began
angrily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Which
door
?
'
said
the
Frog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
almost
stamped
with
irritation
at
the
slow
drawl
in
which
he
*NL*
spoke
.
`
THIS
door
,
of
course
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Frog
looked
at
the
door
with
his
large
dull
eyes
for
a
minute
:
*NL*
then
he
went
nearer
and
rubbed
it
with
his
thumb
,
as
if
he
were
trying
*NL*
whether
the
paint
would
come
off
;
then
he
looked
at
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
answer
the
door
?
'
he
said
.
`
What
's
it
been
asking
of
?
'
He
was
so
*NL*
hoarse
that
Alice
could
scarcely
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
,
'
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
talks
English
,
does
n't
I
?
'
the
Frog
went
on
.
`
Or
are
you
deaf
?
What
*NL*
did
it
ask
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
!
'
Alice
said
impatiently
.
`
I
've
been
knocking
at
it
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Should
n't
do
that
--
should
n't
do
that
--
'
the
Frog
muttered
.
`
Vexes
it
,
*NL*
you
know
.
'
Then
he
went
up
and
gave
the
door
a
kick
with
one
of
his
*NL*
great
feet
.
`
You
let
IT
alone
,
'
he
panted
out
,
as
he
hobbled
back
to
his
*NL*
tree
,
`
and
it
'll
let
YOU
alone
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
door
was
flung
open
,
and
a
shrill
voice
was
heard
*NL*
singing
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
the
Looking-Glass
world
it
was
Alice
that
said
,
*NL*
``
I
've
a
sceptre
in
hand
,
I
've
a
crown
on
my
head
;
*NL*
Let
the
Looking-Glass
creatures
,
whatever
they
be
,
*NL*
Come
and
dine
with
the
Red
Queen
,
the
White
Queen
,
and
me
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
hundreds
of
voices
joined
in
the
chorus
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
fill
up
the
glasses
as
quick
as
you
can
,
*NL*
And
sprinkle
the
table
with
buttons
and
bran
:
*NL*
Put
cats
in
the
coffee
,
and
mice
in
the
tea
--
*NL*
And
welcome
Queen
Alice
with
thirty-times-three
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Then
followed
a
confused
noise
of
cheering
,
and
Alice
thought
to
*NL*
herself
,
`
Thirty
times
three
makes
ninety
.
I
wonder
if
any
one
's
*NL*
counting
?
'
In
a
minute
there
was
silence
again
,
and
the
same
shrill
*NL*
voice
sang
another
verse
;
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
O
Looking-Glass
creatures
,
''
quoth
Alice
,
``
draw
near
!
*NL*
'T
is
an
honour
to
see
me
,
a
favour
to
hear
:
*NL*
'T
is
a
privilege
high
to
have
dinner
and
tea
*NL*
Along
with
the
Red
Queen
,
the
White
Queen
,
and
me
!
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
chorus
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
fill
up
the
glasses
with
treacle
and
ink
,
*NL*
Or
anything
else
that
is
pleasant
to
drink
:
*NL*
Mix
sand
with
the
cider
,
and
wool
with
the
wine
--
*NL*
And
welcome
Queen
Alice
with
ninety-times-nine
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ninety
times
nine
!
'
Alice
repeated
in
despair
,
`
Oh
,
that
'll
never
*NL*
be
done
!
I
'd
better
go
in
at
once
--
'
and
there
was
a
dead
silence
the
*NL*
moment
she
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alice
glanced
nervously
along
the
table
,
as
she
walked
up
the
large
*NL*
hall
,
and
noticed
that
there
were
about
fifty
guests
,
of
all
kinds
:
some
*NL*
were
animals
,
some
birds
,
and
there
were
even
a
few
flowers
among
them
.
*NL*
`
I
'm
glad
they
've
come
without
waiting
to
be
asked
,
'
she
thought
:
'
I
*NL*
should
never
have
known
who
were
the
right
people
to
invite
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
three
chairs
at
the
head
of
the
table
;
the
Red
and
White
*NL*
Queens
had
already
taken
two
of
them
,
but
the
middle
one
was
empty
.
*NL*
Alice
sat
down
in
it
,
rather
uncomfortable
in
the
silence
,
and
longing
*NL*
for
some
one
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
Red
Queen
began
.
`
You
've
missed
the
soup
and
fish
,
'
she
*NL*
said
.
`
Put
on
the
joint
!
'
And
the
waiters
set
a
leg
of
mutton
before
*NL*
Alice
,
who
looked
at
it
rather
anxiously
,
as
she
had
never
had
to
carve
*NL*
a
joint
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
look
a
little
shy
;
let
me
introduce
you
to
that
leg
of
mutton
,
'
*NL*
said
the
Red
Queen
.
`
Alice
--
Mutton
;
Mutton
--
Alice
.
'
The
leg
of
mutton
*NL*
got
up
in
the
dish
and
made
a
little
bow
to
Alice
;
and
Alice
returned
*NL*
the
bow
,
not
knowing
whether
to
be
frightened
or
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
May
I
give
you
a
slice
?
'
she
said
,
taking
up
the
knife
and
fork
,
and
*NL*
looking
from
one
Queen
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
not
,
'
the
Red
Queen
said
,
very
decidedly
:
`
it
is
n't
etiquette
*NL*
to
cut
any
one
you
've
been
introduced
to
.
Remove
the
joint
!
'
And
the
*NL*
waiters
carried
it
off
,
and
brought
a
large
plum-pudding
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wo
n't
be
introduced
to
the
pudding
,
please
,
'
Alice
said
rather
*NL*
hastily
,
`
or
we
shall
get
no
dinner
at
all
.
May
I
give
you
some
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
Red
Queen
looked
sulky
,
and
growled
`
Pudding
--
Alice
;
*NL*
Alice
--
Pudding
.
Remove
the
pudding
!
'
and
the
waiters
took
it
away
so
*NL*
quickly
that
Alice
could
n't
return
its
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
she
did
n't
see
why
the
Red
Queen
should
be
the
only
one
to
give
*NL*
orders
,
so
,
as
an
experiment
,
she
called
out
`
Waiter
!
Bring
back
the
*NL*
pudding
!
'
and
there
it
was
again
in
a
moment
like
a
conjuring-trick
.
It
*NL*
was
so
large
that
she
could
n't
help
feeling
a
LITTLE
shy
with
it
,
as
she
*NL*
had
been
with
the
mutton
;
however
,
she
conquered
her
shyness
by
a
great
*NL*
effort
and
cut
a
slice
and
handed
it
to
the
Red
Queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
impertinence
!
'
said
the
Pudding
.
'
I
wonder
how
you
'd
like
it
,
if
I
*NL*
were
to
cut
a
slice
out
of
YOU
,
you
creature
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
spoke
in
a
thick
,
suety
sort
of
voice
,
and
Alice
had
n't
a
word
to
say
*NL*
in
reply
:
she
could
only
sit
and
look
at
it
and
gasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Make
a
remark
,
'
said
the
Red
Queen
:
`
it
's
ridiculous
to
leave
all
the
*NL*
conversation
to
the
pudding
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
know
,
I
've
had
such
a
quantity
of
poetry
repeated
to
me
to-day
,
'
*NL*
Alice
began
,
a
little
frightened
at
finding
that
,
the
moment
she
opened
*NL*
her
lips
,
there
was
dead
silence
,
and
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
her
;
`
and
*NL*
it
's
a
very
curious
thing
,
I
think
--
every
poem
was
about
fishes
in
some
*NL*
way
.
Do
you
know
why
they
're
so
fond
of
fishes
,
all
about
here
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
to
the
Red
Queen
,
whose
answer
was
a
little
wide
of
the
mark
.
*NL*
`
As
to
fishes
,
'
she
said
,
very
slowly
and
solemnly
,
putting
her
mouth
*NL*
close
to
Alice
's
ear
,
`
her
White
Majesty
knows
a
lovely
riddle
--
all
in
*NL*
poetry
--
all
about
fishes
.
Shall
she
repeat
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Her
Red
Majesty
's
very
kind
to
mention
it
,
'
the
White
Queen
murmured
*NL*
into
Alice
's
other
ear
,
in
a
voice
like
the
cooing
of
a
pigeon
.
`
It
*NL*
would
be
SUCH
a
treat
!
May
I
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Please
do
,
'
Alice
said
very
politely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
White
Queen
laughed
with
delight
,
and
stroked
Alice
's
cheek
.
Then
*NL*
she
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
First
,
the
fish
must
be
caught
.
''
*NL*
That
is
easy
:
a
baby
,
I
think
,
could
have
caught
it
.
*NL*
``
Next
,
the
fish
must
be
bought
.
''
*NL*
That
is
easy
:
a
penny
,
I
think
,
would
have
bought
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
cook
me
the
fish
!
''
*NL*
That
is
easy
,
and
will
not
take
more
than
a
minute
.
*NL*
``
Let
it
lie
in
a
dish
!
''
*NL*
That
is
easy
,
because
it
already
is
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
it
here
!
Let
me
sup
!
''
*NL*
It
is
easy
to
set
such
a
dish
on
the
table
.
*NL*
``
Take
the
dish-cover
up
!
''
*NL*
Ah
,
THAT
is
so
hard
that
I
fear
I
'm
unable
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
it
holds
it
like
glue
--
*NL*
Holds
the
lid
to
the
dish
,
while
it
lies
in
the
middle
:
*NL*
Which
is
easiest
to
do
,
*NL*
Un-dish-cover
the
fish
,
or
dishcover
the
riddle
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
a
minute
to
think
about
it
,
and
then
guess
,
'
said
the
Red
Queen
.
*NL*
`
Meanwhile
,
we
'll
drink
your
health
--
Queen
Alice
's
health
!
'
she
screamed
*NL*
at
the
top
of
her
voice
,
and
all
the
guests
began
drinking
it
directly
,
*NL*
and
very
queerly
they
managed
it
:
some
of
them
put
their
glasses
upon
*NL*
their
heads
like
extinguishers
,
and
drank
all
that
trickled
down
their
*NL*
faces
--
others
upset
the
decanters
,
and
drank
the
wine
as
it
ran
off
*NL*
the
edges
of
the
table
--
and
three
of
them
-LRB-
who
looked
like
kangaroos
-RRB-
*NL*
scrambled
into
the
dish
of
roast
mutton
,
and
began
eagerly
lapping
up
*NL*
the
gravy
,
`
just
like
pigs
in
a
trough
!
'
thought
Alice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
ought
to
return
thanks
in
a
neat
speech
,
'
the
Red
Queen
said
,
*NL*
frowning
at
Alice
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
must
support
you
,
you
know
,
'
the
White
Queen
whispered
,
as
Alice
got
*NL*
up
to
do
it
,
very
obediently
,
but
a
little
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thank
you
very
much
,
'
she
whispered
in
reply
,
`
but
I
can
do
quite
well
*NL*
without
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
would
n't
be
at
all
the
thing
,
'
the
Red
Queen
said
very
decidedly
:
*NL*
so
Alice
tried
to
submit
to
it
with
a
good
grace
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
`
And
they
DID
push
so
!
'
she
said
afterwards
,
when
she
was
telling
her
*NL*
sister
the
history
of
the
feast
.
`
You
would
have
thought
they
wanted
to
*NL*
squeeze
me
flat
!
'
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
it
was
rather
difficult
for
her
to
keep
in
her
place
while
she
*NL*
made
her
speech
:
the
two
Queens
pushed
her
so
,
one
on
each
side
,
that
*NL*
they
nearly
lifted
her
up
into
the
air
:
'
I
rise
to
return
thanks
--
'
*NL*
Alice
began
:
and
she
really
DID
rise
as
she
spoke
,
several
inches
;
but
*NL*
she
got
hold
of
the
edge
of
the
table
,
and
managed
to
pull
herself
down
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Take
care
of
yourself
!
'
screamed
the
White
Queen
,
seizing
Alice
's
hair
*NL*
with
both
her
hands
.
`
Something
's
going
to
happen
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
-LRB-
as
Alice
afterwards
described
it
-RRB-
all
sorts
of
things
happened
*NL*
in
a
moment
.
The
candles
all
grew
up
to
the
ceiling
,
looking
something
*NL*
like
a
bed
of
rushes
with
fireworks
at
the
top
.
As
to
the
bottles
,
they
*NL*
each
took
a
pair
of
plates
,
which
they
hastily
fitted
on
as
wings
,
and
*NL*
so
,
with
forks
for
legs
,
went
fluttering
about
in
all
directions
:
`
and
*NL*
very
like
birds
they
look
,
'
Alice
thought
to
herself
,
as
well
as
she
*NL*
could
in
the
dreadful
confusion
that
was
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
she
heard
a
hoarse
laugh
at
her
side
,
and
turned
to
see
*NL*
what
was
the
matter
with
the
White
Queen
;
but
,
instead
of
the
Queen
,
*NL*
there
was
the
leg
of
mutton
sitting
in
the
chair
.
`
Here
I
am
!
'
cried
a
*NL*
voice
from
the
soup
tureen
,
and
Alice
turned
again
,
just
in
time
to
see
*NL*
the
Queen
's
broad
good-natured
face
grinning
at
her
for
a
moment
over
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
tureen
,
before
she
disappeared
into
the
soup
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
.
Already
several
of
the
guests
were
*NL*
lying
down
in
the
dishes
,
and
the
soup
ladle
was
walking
up
the
table
*NL*
towards
Alice
's
chair
,
and
beckoning
to
her
impatiently
to
get
out
of
*NL*
its
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
stand
this
any
longer
!
'
she
cried
as
she
jumped
up
and
seized
*NL*
the
table-cloth
with
both
hands
:
one
good
pull
,
and
plates
,
dishes
,
*NL*
guests
,
and
candles
came
crashing
down
together
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
as
for
YOU
,
'
she
went
on
,
turning
fiercely
upon
the
Red
Queen
,
whom
*NL*
she
considered
as
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
--
but
the
Queen
was
no
*NL*
longer
at
her
side
--
she
had
suddenly
dwindled
down
to
the
size
of
a
*NL*
little
doll
,
and
was
now
on
the
table
,
merrily
running
round
and
round
*NL*
after
her
own
shawl
,
which
was
trailing
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
other
time
,
Alice
would
have
felt
surprised
at
this
,
but
she
was
*NL*
far
too
much
excited
to
be
surprised
at
anything
NOW
.
`
As
for
YOU
,
'
*NL*
she
repeated
,
catching
hold
of
the
little
creature
in
the
very
act
of
*NL*
jumping
over
a
bottle
which
had
just
lighted
upon
the
table
,
`
I
'll
shake
*NL*
you
into
a
kitten
,
that
I
will
!

*NL*

CHAPTER
X.
Shaking
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
her
off
the
table
as
she
spoke
,
and
shook
her
backwards
and
*NL*
forwards
with
all
her
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Red
Queen
made
no
resistance
whatever
;
only
her
face
grew
very
*NL*
small
,
and
her
eyes
got
large
and
green
:
and
still
,
as
Alice
went
on
*NL*
shaking
her
,
she
kept
on
growing
shorter
--
and
fatter
--
and
softer
--
and
*NL*
rounder
--
and

CHAPTER

Waking
*NL*
*NL*
--
and
it
really
WAS
a
kitten
,
after
all
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
XII
.
Which
Dreamed
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Your
majesty
should
n't
purr
so
loud
,
'
Alice
said
,
rubbing
her
eyes
,
and
*NL*
addressing
the
kitten
,
respectfully
,
yet
with
some
severity
.
`
You
*NL*
woke
me
out
of
oh
!
such
a
nice
dream
!
And
you
've
been
along
with
me
,
*NL*
Kitty
--
all
through
the
Looking-Glass
world
.
Did
you
know
it
,
dear
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
very
inconvenient
habit
of
kittens
-LRB-
Alice
had
once
made
the
*NL*
remark
-RRB-
that
,
whatever
you
say
to
them
,
they
ALWAYS
purr
.
`
If
they
would
*NL*
only
purr
for
``
yes
''
and
mew
for
``
no
,
''
or
any
rule
of
that
sort
,
'
she
had
*NL*
said
,
`
so
that
one
could
keep
up
a
conversation
!
But
how
CAN
you
talk
*NL*
with
a
person
if
they
always
say
the
same
thing
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
occasion
the
kitten
only
purred
:
and
it
was
impossible
to
guess
*NL*
whether
it
meant
`
yes
'
or
`
no
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
Alice
hunted
among
the
chessmen
on
the
table
till
she
had
found
the
*NL*
Red
Queen
:
then
she
went
down
on
her
knees
on
the
hearth-rug
,
and
put
*NL*
the
kitten
and
the
Queen
to
look
at
each
other
.
`
Now
,
Kitty
!
'
she
cried
,
*NL*
clapping
her
hands
triumphantly
.
`
Confess
that
was
what
you
turned
*NL*
into
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
`
But
it
would
n't
look
at
it
,
'
she
said
,
when
she
was
explaining
the
*NL*
thing
afterwards
to
her
sister
:
`
it
turned
away
its
head
,
and
pretended
*NL*
not
to
see
it
:
but
it
looked
a
LITTLE
ashamed
of
itself
,
so
I
think
it
*NL*
MUST
have
been
the
Red
Queen
.
'
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
Sit
up
a
little
more
stiffly
,
dear
!
'
Alice
cried
with
a
merry
laugh
.
*NL*
`
And
curtsey
while
you
're
thinking
what
to
--
what
to
purr
.
It
saves
time
,
*NL*
remember
!
'
And
she
caught
it
up
and
gave
it
one
little
kiss
,
`
just
in
*NL*
honour
of
having
been
a
Red
Queen
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Snowdrop
,
my
pet
!
'
she
went
on
,
looking
over
her
shoulder
at
the
White
*NL*
Kitten
,
which
was
still
patiently
undergoing
its
toilet
,
`
when
WILL
*NL*
Dinah
have
finished
with
your
White
Majesty
,
I
wonder
?
That
must
be
the
*NL*
reason
you
were
so
untidy
in
my
dream
--
Dinah
!
do
you
know
that
you
're
*NL*
scrubbing
a
White
Queen
?
Really
,
it
's
most
disrespectful
of
you
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
did
DINAH
turn
to
,
I
wonder
?
'
she
prattled
on
,
as
she
settled
*NL*
comfortably
down
,
with
one
elbow
in
the
rug
,
and
her
chin
in
her
hand
,
*NL*
to
watch
the
kittens
.
`
Tell
me
,
Dinah
,
did
you
turn
to
Humpty
Dumpty
?
I
*NL*
THINK
you
did
--
however
,
you
'd
better
not
mention
it
to
your
friends
just
*NL*
yet
,
for
I
'm
not
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
the
way
,
Kitty
,
if
only
you
'd
been
really
with
me
in
my
dream
,
there
*NL*
was
one
thing
you
WOULD
have
enjoyed
--
I
had
such
a
quantity
of
poetry
*NL*
said
to
me
,
all
about
fishes
!
To-morrow
morning
you
shall
have
a
real
*NL*
treat
.
All
the
time
you
're
eating
your
breakfast
,
I
'll
repeat
``
The
*NL*
Walrus
and
the
Carpenter
''
to
you
;
and
then
you
can
make
believe
it
's
*NL*
oysters
,
dear
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
Kitty
,
let
's
consider
who
it
was
that
dreamed
it
all
.
This
is
a
*NL*
serious
question
,
my
dear
,
and
you
should
NOT
go
on
licking
your
paw
*NL*
like
that
--
as
if
Dinah
had
n't
washed
you
this
morning
!
You
see
,
Kitty
,
*NL*
it
MUST
have
been
either
me
or
the
Red
King
.
He
was
part
of
my
dream
,
*NL*
of
course
--
but
then
I
was
part
of
his
dream
,
too
!
WAS
it
the
Red
King
,
*NL*
Kitty
?
You
were
his
wife
,
my
dear
,
so
you
ought
to
know
--
Oh
,
Kitty
,
DO
*NL*
help
to
settle
it
!
I
'm
sure
your
paw
can
wait
!
'
But
the
provoking
kitten
*NL*
only
began
on
the
other
paw
,
and
pretended
it
had
n't
heard
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
do
YOU
think
it
was
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
boat
beneath
a
sunny
sky
,
*NL*
Lingering
onward
dreamily
*NL*
In
an
evening
of
July
--
*NL*
*NL*
Children
three
that
nestle
near
,
*NL*
Eager
eye
and
willing
ear
,
*NL*
Pleased
a
simple
tale
to
hear
--
*NL*
*NL*
Long
has
paled
that
sunny
sky
:
*NL*
Echoes
fade
and
memories
die
.
*NL*
Autumn
frosts
have
slain
July
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
she
haunts
me
,
phantomwise
,
*NL*
Alice
moving
under
skies
*NL*
Never
seen
by
waking
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Children
yet
,
the
tale
to
hear
,
*NL*
Eager
eye
and
willing
ear
,
*NL*
Lovingly
shall
nestle
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
Wonderland
they
lie
,
*NL*
Dreaming
as
the
days
go
by
,
*NL*
Dreaming
as
the
summers
die
:
*NL*
*NL*
Ever
drifting
down
the
stream
--
*NL*
Lingering
in
the
golden
gleam
--
*NL*
Life
,
what
is
it
but
a
dream
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
END
