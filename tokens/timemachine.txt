The
Time
Machine
,
by
H.
G.
Wells
-LSB-
1898
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
-LRB-
for
so
it
will
be
convenient
to
speak
of
him
-RRB-
*NL*
was
expounding
a
recondite
matter
to
us
.
His
grey
eyes
shone
and
*NL*
twinkled
,
and
his
usually
pale
face
was
flushed
and
animated
.
The
*NL*
fire
burned
brightly
,
and
the
soft
radiance
of
the
incandescent
*NL*
lights
in
the
lilies
of
silver
caught
the
bubbles
that
flashed
and
*NL*
passed
in
our
glasses
.
Our
chairs
,
being
his
patents
,
embraced
and
*NL*
caressed
us
rather
than
submitted
to
be
sat
upon
,
and
there
was
that
*NL*
luxurious
after-dinner
atmosphere
when
thought
roams
gracefully
*NL*
free
of
the
trammels
of
precision
.
And
he
put
it
to
us
in
this
*NL*
way
--
marking
the
points
with
a
lean
forefinger
--
as
we
sat
and
lazily
*NL*
admired
his
earnestness
over
this
new
paradox
-LRB-
as
we
thought
it
-RRB-
*NL*
and
his
fecundity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
follow
me
carefully
.
I
shall
have
to
controvert
one
or
two
*NL*
ideas
that
are
almost
universally
accepted
.
The
geometry
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
they
taught
you
at
school
is
founded
on
a
misconception
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Is
not
that
rather
a
large
thing
to
expect
us
to
begin
upon
?
'
*NL*
said
Filby
,
an
argumentative
person
with
red
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
not
mean
to
ask
you
to
accept
anything
without
reasonable
*NL*
ground
for
it
.
You
will
soon
admit
as
much
as
I
need
from
you
.
You
*NL*
know
of
course
that
a
mathematical
line
,
a
line
of
thickness
_
nil
_
,
*NL*
has
no
real
existence
.
They
taught
you
that
?
Neither
has
a
*NL*
mathematical
plane
.
These
things
are
mere
abstractions
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
all
right
,
'
said
the
Psychologist
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nor
,
having
only
length
,
breadth
,
and
thickness
,
can
a
cube
have
a
*NL*
real
existence
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
I
object
,
'
said
Filby
.
`
Of
course
a
solid
body
may
exist
.
All
*NL*
real
things
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
most
people
think
.
But
wait
a
moment
.
Can
an
_
instantaneous
_
*NL*
cube
exist
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
follow
you
,
'
said
Filby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Can
a
cube
that
does
not
last
for
any
time
at
all
,
have
a
real
*NL*
existence
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Filby
became
pensive
.
`
Clearly
,
'
the
Time
Traveller
proceeded
,
`
any
*NL*
real
body
must
have
extension
in
_
four
_
directions
:
it
must
have
*NL*
Length
,
Breadth
,
Thickness
,
and
--
Duration
.
But
through
a
natural
*NL*
infirmity
of
the
flesh
,
which
I
will
explain
to
you
in
a
moment
,
we
*NL*
incline
to
overlook
this
fact
.
There
are
really
four
dimensions
,
*NL*
three
which
we
call
the
three
planes
of
Space
,
and
a
fourth
,
Time
.
*NL*
There
is
,
however
,
a
tendency
to
draw
an
unreal
distinction
between
*NL*
the
former
three
dimensions
and
the
latter
,
because
it
happens
that
*NL*
our
consciousness
moves
intermittently
in
one
direction
along
the
*NL*
latter
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
our
lives
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
,
'
said
a
very
young
man
,
making
spasmodic
efforts
to
relight
*NL*
his
cigar
over
the
lamp
;
`
that
...
very
clear
indeed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
it
is
very
remarkable
that
this
is
so
extensively
overlooked
,
'
*NL*
continued
the
Time
Traveller
,
with
a
slight
accession
of
*NL*
cheerfulness
.
`
Really
this
is
what
is
meant
by
the
Fourth
Dimension
,
*NL*
though
some
people
who
talk
about
the
Fourth
Dimension
do
not
know
*NL*
they
mean
it
.
It
is
only
another
way
of
looking
at
Time
.
_
There
is
*NL*
no
difference
between
Time
and
any
of
the
three
dimensions
of
Space
*NL*
except
that
our
consciousness
moves
along
it
_
.
But
some
foolish
*NL*
people
have
got
hold
of
the
wrong
side
of
that
idea
.
You
have
all
*NL*
heard
what
they
have
to
say
about
this
Fourth
Dimension
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
_
I
_
have
not
,
'
said
the
Provincial
Mayor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
simply
this
.
That
Space
,
as
our
mathematicians
have
it
,
is
*NL*
spoken
of
as
having
three
dimensions
,
which
one
may
call
Length
,
*NL*
Breadth
,
and
Thickness
,
and
is
always
definable
by
reference
to
*NL*
three
planes
,
each
at
right
angles
to
the
others
.
But
some
*NL*
philosophical
people
have
been
asking
why
_
three
_
dimensions
*NL*
particularly
--
why
not
another
direction
at
right
angles
to
the
other
*NL*
three
?
--
and
have
even
tried
to
construct
a
Four-Dimension
geometry
.
*NL*
Professor
Simon
Newcomb
was
expounding
this
to
the
New
York
*NL*
Mathematical
Society
only
a
month
or
so
ago
.
You
know
how
on
a
flat
*NL*
surface
,
which
has
only
two
dimensions
,
we
can
represent
a
figure
of
*NL*
a
three-dimensional
solid
,
and
similarly
they
think
that
by
models
*NL*
of
three
dimensions
they
could
represent
one
of
four
--
if
they
could
*NL*
master
the
perspective
of
the
thing
.
See
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
so
,
'
murmured
the
Provincial
Mayor
;
and
,
knitting
his
*NL*
brows
,
he
lapsed
into
an
introspective
state
,
his
lips
moving
as
one
*NL*
who
repeats
mystic
words
.
`
Yes
,
I
think
I
see
it
now
,
'
he
said
after
*NL*
some
time
,
brightening
in
a
quite
transitory
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
I
do
not
mind
telling
you
I
have
been
at
work
upon
this
*NL*
geometry
of
Four
Dimensions
for
some
time
.
Some
of
my
results
*NL*
are
curious
.
For
instance
,
here
is
a
portrait
of
a
man
at
eight
*NL*
years
old
,
another
at
fifteen
,
another
at
seventeen
,
another
at
*NL*
twenty-three
,
and
so
on
.
All
these
are
evidently
sections
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
Three-Dimensional
representations
of
his
Four-Dimensioned
*NL*
being
,
which
is
a
fixed
and
unalterable
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Scientific
people
,
'
proceeded
the
Time
Traveller
,
after
the
pause
*NL*
required
for
the
proper
assimilation
of
this
,
`
know
very
well
that
*NL*
Time
is
only
a
kind
of
Space
.
Here
is
a
popular
scientific
diagram
,
*NL*
a
weather
record
.
This
line
I
trace
with
my
finger
shows
the
*NL*
movement
of
the
barometer
.
Yesterday
it
was
so
high
,
yesterday
night
*NL*
it
fell
,
then
this
morning
it
rose
again
,
and
so
gently
upward
to
*NL*
here
.
Surely
the
mercury
did
not
trace
this
line
in
any
of
the
*NL*
dimensions
of
Space
generally
recognized
?
But
certainly
it
traced
*NL*
such
a
line
,
and
that
line
,
therefore
,
we
must
conclude
was
along
*NL*
the
Time-Dimension
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
'
said
the
Medical
Man
,
staring
hard
at
a
coal
in
the
fire
,
`
if
*NL*
Time
is
really
only
a
fourth
dimension
of
Space
,
why
is
it
,
and
why
*NL*
has
it
always
been
,
regarded
as
something
different
?
And
why
can
not
*NL*
we
move
in
Time
as
we
move
about
in
the
other
dimensions
of
Space
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
smiled
.
`
Are
you
sure
we
can
move
freely
in
*NL*
Space
?
Right
and
left
we
can
go
,
backward
and
forward
freely
enough
,
*NL*
and
men
always
have
done
so
.
I
admit
we
move
freely
in
two
*NL*
dimensions
.
But
how
about
up
and
down
?
Gravitation
limits
us
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
exactly
,
'
said
the
Medical
Man
.
`
There
are
balloons
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
before
the
balloons
,
save
for
spasmodic
jumping
and
the
*NL*
inequalities
of
the
surface
,
man
had
no
freedom
of
vertical
*NL*
movement
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Still
they
could
move
a
little
up
and
down
,
'
said
the
Medical
Man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Easier
,
far
easier
down
than
up
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
you
can
not
move
at
all
in
Time
,
you
can
not
get
away
from
the
*NL*
present
moment
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
dear
sir
,
that
is
just
where
you
are
wrong
.
That
is
just
where
*NL*
the
whole
world
has
gone
wrong
.
We
are
always
getting
away
from
the
*NL*
present
moment
.
Our
mental
existences
,
which
are
immaterial
and
have
*NL*
no
dimensions
,
are
passing
along
the
Time-Dimension
with
a
uniform
*NL*
velocity
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
.
Just
as
we
should
travel
_
down
_
*NL*
if
we
began
our
existence
fifty
miles
above
the
earth
's
surface
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
the
great
difficulty
is
this
,
'
interrupted
the
Psychologist
.
*NL*
`
You
_
can
_
move
about
in
all
directions
of
Space
,
but
you
can
not
*NL*
move
about
in
Time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
the
germ
of
my
great
discovery
.
But
you
are
wrong
to
say
*NL*
that
we
can
not
move
about
in
Time
.
For
instance
,
if
I
am
recalling
*NL*
an
incident
very
vividly
I
go
back
to
the
instant
of
its
occurrence
:
*NL*
I
become
absent-minded
,
as
you
say
.
I
jump
back
for
a
moment
.
Of
*NL*
course
we
have
no
means
of
staying
back
for
any
length
of
Time
,
any
*NL*
more
than
a
savage
or
an
animal
has
of
staying
six
feet
above
the
*NL*
ground
.
But
a
civilized
man
is
better
off
than
the
savage
in
this
*NL*
respect
.
He
can
go
up
against
gravitation
in
a
balloon
,
and
why
*NL*
should
he
not
hope
that
ultimately
he
may
be
able
to
stop
or
*NL*
accelerate
his
drift
along
the
Time-Dimension
,
or
even
turn
about
*NL*
and
travel
the
other
way
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
_
this
_
,
'
began
Filby
,
`
is
all
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
not
?
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
against
reason
,
'
said
Filby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
reason
?
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
can
show
black
is
white
by
argument
,
'
said
Filby
,
`
but
you
will
*NL*
never
convince
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Possibly
not
,
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
.
`
But
now
you
begin
to
see
*NL*
the
object
of
my
investigations
into
the
geometry
of
Four
*NL*
Dimensions
.
Long
ago
I
had
a
vague
inkling
of
a
machine
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
travel
through
Time
!
'
exclaimed
the
Very
Young
Man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
shall
travel
indifferently
in
any
direction
of
Space
and
Time
,
*NL*
as
the
driver
determines
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Filby
contented
himself
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
have
experimental
verification
,
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
would
be
remarkably
convenient
for
the
historian
,
'
the
*NL*
Psychologist
suggested
.
`
One
might
travel
back
and
verify
the
*NL*
accepted
account
of
the
Battle
of
Hastings
,
for
instance
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
n't
you
think
you
would
attract
attention
?
'
said
the
Medical
Man
.
*NL*
`
Our
ancestors
had
no
great
tolerance
for
anachronisms
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
One
might
get
one
's
Greek
from
the
very
lips
of
Homer
and
Plato
,
'
*NL*
the
Very
Young
Man
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
which
case
they
would
certainly
plough
you
for
the
Little-go
.
*NL*
The
German
scholars
have
improved
Greek
so
much
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
there
is
the
future
,
'
said
the
Very
Young
Man
.
`
Just
think
!
*NL*
One
might
invest
all
one
's
money
,
leave
it
to
accumulate
at
*NL*
interest
,
and
hurry
on
ahead
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
discover
a
society
,
'
said
I
,
`
erected
on
a
strictly
communistic
*NL*
basis
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
all
the
wild
extravagant
theories
!
'
began
the
Psychologist
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
so
it
seemed
to
me
,
and
so
I
never
talked
of
it
until
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Experimental
verification
!
'
cried
I.
`
You
are
going
to
verify
*NL*
_
that
_
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
experiment
!
'
cried
Filby
,
who
was
getting
brain-weary
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
's
see
your
experiment
anyhow
,
'
said
the
Psychologist
,
`
though
*NL*
it
's
all
humbug
,
you
know
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
smiled
round
at
us
.
Then
,
still
smiling
faintly
,
*NL*
and
with
his
hands
deep
in
his
trousers
pockets
,
he
walked
slowly
*NL*
out
of
the
room
,
and
we
heard
his
slippers
shuffling
down
the
long
*NL*
passage
to
his
laboratory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Psychologist
looked
at
us
.
'
I
wonder
what
he
's
got
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Some
sleight-of-hand
trick
or
other
,
'
said
the
Medical
Man
,
and
*NL*
Filby
tried
to
tell
us
about
a
conjurer
he
had
seen
at
Burslem
;
but
*NL*
before
he
had
finished
his
preface
the
Time
Traveller
came
back
,
and
*NL*
Filby
's
anecdote
collapsed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thing
the
Time
Traveller
held
in
his
hand
was
a
glittering
*NL*
metallic
framework
,
scarcely
larger
than
a
small
clock
,
and
very
*NL*
delicately
made
.
There
was
ivory
in
it
,
and
some
transparent
*NL*
crystalline
substance
.
And
now
I
must
be
explicit
,
for
this
that
*NL*
follows
--
unless
his
explanation
is
to
be
accepted
--
is
an
absolutely
*NL*
unaccountable
thing
.
He
took
one
of
the
small
octagonal
tables
that
*NL*
were
scattered
about
the
room
,
and
set
it
in
front
of
the
fire
,
with
*NL*
two
legs
on
the
hearthrug
.
On
this
table
he
placed
the
mechanism
.
*NL*
Then
he
drew
up
a
chair
,
and
sat
down
.
The
only
other
object
on
the
*NL*
table
was
a
small
shaded
lamp
,
the
bright
light
of
which
fell
upon
*NL*
the
model
.
There
were
also
perhaps
a
dozen
candles
about
,
two
in
*NL*
brass
candlesticks
upon
the
mantel
and
several
in
sconces
,
so
that
*NL*
the
room
was
brilliantly
illuminated
.
I
sat
in
a
low
arm-chair
*NL*
nearest
the
fire
,
and
I
drew
this
forward
so
as
to
be
almost
between
*NL*
the
Time
Traveller
and
the
fireplace
.
Filby
sat
behind
him
,
looking
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
.
The
Medical
Man
and
the
Provincial
Mayor
watched
*NL*
him
in
profile
from
the
right
,
the
Psychologist
from
the
left
.
The
*NL*
Very
Young
Man
stood
behind
the
Psychologist
.
We
were
all
on
the
*NL*
alert
.
It
appears
incredible
to
me
that
any
kind
of
trick
,
however
*NL*
subtly
conceived
and
however
adroitly
done
,
could
have
been
played
*NL*
upon
us
under
these
conditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
looked
at
us
,
and
then
at
the
mechanism
.
`
Well
?
'
*NL*
said
the
Psychologist
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
little
affair
,
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
,
resting
his
elbows
*NL*
upon
the
table
and
pressing
his
hands
together
above
the
apparatus
,
*NL*
`
is
only
a
model
.
It
is
my
plan
for
a
machine
to
travel
through
*NL*
time
.
You
will
notice
that
it
looks
singularly
askew
,
and
that
there
*NL*
is
an
odd
twinkling
appearance
about
this
bar
,
as
though
it
was
in
*NL*
some
way
unreal
.
'
He
pointed
to
the
part
with
his
finger
.
`
Also
,
*NL*
here
is
one
little
white
lever
,
and
here
is
another
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Medical
Man
got
up
out
of
his
chair
and
peered
into
the
thing
.
*NL*
`
It
's
beautifully
made
,
'
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
took
two
years
to
make
,
'
retorted
the
Time
Traveller
.
Then
,
when
*NL*
we
had
all
imitated
the
action
of
the
Medical
Man
,
he
said
:
`
Now
I
*NL*
want
you
clearly
to
understand
that
this
lever
,
being
pressed
over
,
*NL*
sends
the
machine
gliding
into
the
future
,
and
this
other
reverses
*NL*
the
motion
.
This
saddle
represents
the
seat
of
a
time
traveller
.
*NL*
Presently
I
am
going
to
press
the
lever
,
and
off
the
machine
will
*NL*
go
.
It
will
vanish
,
pass
into
future
Time
,
and
disappear
.
Have
a
*NL*
good
look
at
the
thing
.
Look
at
the
table
too
,
and
satisfy
*NL*
yourselves
there
is
no
trickery
.
I
do
n't
want
to
waste
this
model
,
*NL*
and
then
be
told
I
'm
a
quack
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
minute
's
pause
perhaps
.
The
Psychologist
seemed
about
to
*NL*
speak
to
me
,
but
changed
his
mind
.
Then
the
Time
Traveller
put
forth
*NL*
his
finger
towards
the
lever
.
`
No
,
'
he
said
suddenly
.
`
Lend
me
your
*NL*
hand
.
'
And
turning
to
the
Psychologist
,
he
took
that
individual
's
*NL*
hand
in
his
own
and
told
him
to
put
out
his
forefinger
.
So
that
it
*NL*
was
the
Psychologist
himself
who
sent
forth
the
model
Time
Machine
*NL*
on
its
interminable
voyage
.
We
all
saw
the
lever
turn
.
I
am
*NL*
absolutely
certain
there
was
no
trickery
.
There
was
a
breath
of
*NL*
wind
,
and
the
lamp
flame
jumped
.
One
of
the
candles
on
the
mantel
*NL*
was
blown
out
,
and
the
little
machine
suddenly
swung
round
,
became
*NL*
indistinct
,
was
seen
as
a
ghost
for
a
second
perhaps
,
as
an
eddy
of
*NL*
faintly
glittering
brass
and
ivory
;
and
it
was
gone
--
vanished
!
Save
*NL*
for
the
lamp
the
table
was
bare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
was
silent
for
a
minute
.
Then
Filby
said
he
was
damned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Psychologist
recovered
from
his
stupor
,
and
suddenly
looked
*NL*
under
the
table
.
At
that
the
Time
Traveller
laughed
cheerfully
.
*NL*
`
Well
?
'
he
said
,
with
a
reminiscence
of
the
Psychologist
.
Then
,
*NL*
getting
up
,
he
went
to
the
tobacco
jar
on
the
mantel
,
and
with
his
*NL*
back
to
us
began
to
fill
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
stared
at
each
other
.
`
Look
here
,
'
said
the
Medical
Man
,
`
are
you
*NL*
in
earnest
about
this
?
Do
you
seriously
believe
that
that
machine
*NL*
has
travelled
into
time
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Certainly
,
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
,
stooping
to
light
a
spill
at
*NL*
the
fire
.
Then
he
turned
,
lighting
his
pipe
,
to
look
at
the
*NL*
Psychologist
's
face
.
-LRB-
The
Psychologist
,
to
show
that
he
was
not
*NL*
unhinged
,
helped
himself
to
a
cigar
and
tried
to
light
it
uncut
.
-RRB-
*NL*
`
What
is
more
,
I
have
a
big
machine
nearly
finished
in
there
'
--
he
*NL*
indicated
the
laboratory
--
`
and
when
that
is
put
together
I
mean
to
*NL*
have
a
journey
on
my
own
account
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
mean
to
say
that
that
machine
has
travelled
into
the
future
?
'
*NL*
said
Filby
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Into
the
future
or
the
past
--
I
do
n't
,
for
certain
,
know
which
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
interval
the
Psychologist
had
an
inspiration
.
`
It
must
have
*NL*
gone
into
the
past
if
it
has
gone
anywhere
,
'
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
?
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Because
I
presume
that
it
has
not
moved
in
space
,
and
if
it
*NL*
travelled
into
the
future
it
would
still
be
here
all
this
time
,
*NL*
since
it
must
have
travelled
through
this
time
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
,
'
I
said
,
`
If
it
travelled
into
the
past
it
would
have
been
*NL*
visible
when
we
came
first
into
this
room
;
and
last
Thursday
when
we
*NL*
were
here
;
and
the
Thursday
before
that
;
and
so
forth
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Serious
objections
,
'
remarked
the
Provincial
Mayor
,
with
an
air
of
*NL*
impartiality
,
turning
towards
the
Time
Traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
a
bit
,
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
,
and
,
to
the
Psychologist
:
`
You
*NL*
think
.
You
can
explain
that
.
It
's
presentation
below
the
threshold
,
*NL*
you
know
,
diluted
presentation
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
,
'
said
the
Psychologist
,
and
reassured
us
.
`
That
's
a
*NL*
simple
point
of
psychology
.
I
should
have
thought
of
it
.
It
's
plain
*NL*
enough
,
and
helps
the
paradox
delightfully
.
We
can
not
see
it
,
nor
*NL*
can
we
appreciate
this
machine
,
any
more
than
we
can
the
spoke
of
*NL*
a
wheel
spinning
,
or
a
bullet
flying
through
the
air
.
If
it
is
*NL*
travelling
through
time
fifty
times
or
a
hundred
times
faster
than
*NL*
we
are
,
if
it
gets
through
a
minute
while
we
get
through
a
second
,
*NL*
the
impression
it
creates
will
of
course
be
only
one-fiftieth
or
*NL*
one-hundredth
of
what
it
would
make
if
it
were
not
travelling
in
*NL*
time
.
That
's
plain
enough
.
'
He
passed
his
hand
through
the
space
in
*NL*
which
the
machine
had
been
.
`
You
see
?
'
he
said
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
sat
and
stared
at
the
vacant
table
for
a
minute
or
so
.
Then
the
*NL*
Time
Traveller
asked
us
what
we
thought
of
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
sounds
plausible
enough
to-night
,
'
said
the
Medical
Man
;
`
but
*NL*
wait
until
to-morrow
.
Wait
for
the
common
sense
of
the
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Would
you
like
to
see
the
Time
Machine
itself
?
'
asked
the
Time
*NL*
Traveller
.
And
therewith
,
taking
the
lamp
in
his
hand
,
he
led
the
*NL*
way
down
the
long
,
draughty
corridor
to
his
laboratory
.
I
remember
*NL*
vividly
the
flickering
light
,
his
queer
,
broad
head
in
silhouette
,
*NL*
the
dance
of
the
shadows
,
how
we
all
followed
him
,
puzzled
but
*NL*
incredulous
,
and
how
there
in
the
laboratory
we
beheld
a
larger
*NL*
edition
of
the
little
mechanism
which
we
had
seen
vanish
from
before
*NL*
our
eyes
.
Parts
were
of
nickel
,
parts
of
ivory
,
parts
had
certainly
*NL*
been
filed
or
sawn
out
of
rock
crystal
.
The
thing
was
generally
*NL*
complete
,
but
the
twisted
crystalline
bars
lay
unfinished
upon
the
*NL*
bench
beside
some
sheets
of
drawings
,
and
I
took
one
up
for
a
better
*NL*
look
at
it
.
Quartz
it
seemed
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
here
,
'
said
the
Medical
Man
,
`
are
you
perfectly
serious
?
*NL*
Or
is
this
a
trick
--
like
that
ghost
you
showed
us
last
Christmas
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Upon
that
machine
,
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
,
holding
the
lamp
*NL*
aloft
,
'
I
intend
to
explore
time
.
Is
that
plain
?
I
was
never
more
*NL*
serious
in
my
life
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
us
quite
knew
how
to
take
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
caught
Filby
's
eye
over
the
shoulder
of
the
Medical
Man
,
and
he
*NL*
winked
at
me
solemnly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
that
at
that
time
none
of
us
quite
believed
in
the
Time
*NL*
Machine
.
The
fact
is
,
the
Time
Traveller
was
one
of
those
men
who
*NL*
are
too
clever
to
be
believed
:
you
never
felt
that
you
saw
all
round
*NL*
him
;
you
always
suspected
some
subtle
reserve
,
some
ingenuity
in
*NL*
ambush
,
behind
his
lucid
frankness
.
Had
Filby
shown
the
model
and
*NL*
explained
the
matter
in
the
Time
Traveller
's
words
,
we
should
have
*NL*
shown
_
him
_
far
less
scepticism
.
For
we
should
have
perceived
his
*NL*
motives
;
a
pork
butcher
could
understand
Filby
.
But
the
Time
*NL*
Traveller
had
more
than
a
touch
of
whim
among
his
elements
,
and
we
*NL*
distrusted
him
.
Things
that
would
have
made
the
frame
of
a
less
*NL*
clever
man
seemed
tricks
in
his
hands
.
It
is
a
mistake
to
do
things
*NL*
too
easily
.
The
serious
people
who
took
him
seriously
never
felt
*NL*
quite
sure
of
his
deportment
;
they
were
somehow
aware
that
trusting
*NL*
their
reputations
for
judgment
with
him
was
like
furnishing
a
*NL*
nursery
with
egg-shell
china
.
So
I
do
n't
think
any
of
us
said
very
*NL*
much
about
time
travelling
in
the
interval
between
that
Thursday
and
*NL*
the
next
,
though
its
odd
potentialities
ran
,
no
doubt
,
in
most
of
*NL*
our
minds
:
its
plausibility
,
that
is
,
its
practical
incredibleness
,
*NL*
the
curious
possibilities
of
anachronism
and
of
utter
confusion
it
*NL*
suggested
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
was
particularly
preoccupied
with
the
*NL*
trick
of
the
model
.
That
I
remember
discussing
with
the
Medical
Man
,
*NL*
whom
I
met
on
Friday
at
the
Linnaean
.
He
said
he
had
seen
a
similar
*NL*
thing
at
Tubingen
,
and
laid
considerable
stress
on
the
blowing
out
*NL*
of
the
candle
.
But
how
the
trick
was
done
he
could
not
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
Thursday
I
went
again
to
Richmond
--
I
suppose
I
was
one
of
*NL*
the
Time
Traveller
's
most
constant
guests
--
and
,
arriving
late
,
found
*NL*
four
or
five
men
already
assembled
in
his
drawing-room
.
The
Medical
*NL*
Man
was
standing
before
the
fire
with
a
sheet
of
paper
in
one
hand
*NL*
and
his
watch
in
the
other
.
I
looked
round
for
the
Time
Traveller
,
*NL*
and
--
`
It
's
half-past
seven
now
,
'
said
the
Medical
Man
.
'
I
suppose
*NL*
we
'd
better
have
dinner
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
's
--
?
'
said
I
,
naming
our
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
've
just
come
?
It
's
rather
odd
.
He
's
unavoidably
detained
.
He
*NL*
asks
me
in
this
note
to
lead
off
with
dinner
at
seven
if
he
's
not
*NL*
back
.
Says
he
'll
explain
when
he
comes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
seems
a
pity
to
let
the
dinner
spoil
,
'
said
the
Editor
of
a
*NL*
well-known
daily
paper
;
and
thereupon
the
Doctor
rang
the
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Psychologist
was
the
only
person
besides
the
Doctor
and
myself
*NL*
who
had
attended
the
previous
dinner
.
The
other
men
were
Blank
,
the
*NL*
Editor
aforementioned
,
a
certain
journalist
,
and
another
--
a
quiet
,
*NL*
shy
man
with
a
beard
--
whom
I
did
n't
know
,
and
who
,
as
far
as
my
*NL*
observation
went
,
never
opened
his
mouth
all
the
evening
.
There
was
*NL*
some
speculation
at
the
dinner-table
about
the
Time
Traveller
's
*NL*
absence
,
and
I
suggested
time
travelling
,
in
a
half-jocular
spirit
.
*NL*
The
Editor
wanted
that
explained
to
him
,
and
the
Psychologist
*NL*
volunteered
a
wooden
account
of
the
`
ingenious
paradox
and
trick
'
we
*NL*
had
witnessed
that
day
week
.
He
was
in
the
midst
of
his
exposition
*NL*
when
the
door
from
the
corridor
opened
slowly
and
without
noise
.
I
*NL*
was
facing
the
door
,
and
saw
it
first
.
`
Hallo
!
'
I
said
.
`
At
last
!
'
*NL*
And
the
door
opened
wider
,
and
the
Time
Traveller
stood
before
us
.
*NL*
I
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
.
`
Good
heavens
!
man
,
what
's
the
matter
?
'
*NL*
cried
the
Medical
Man
,
who
saw
him
next
.
And
the
whole
tableful
*NL*
turned
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
an
amazing
plight
.
His
coat
was
dusty
and
dirty
,
and
*NL*
smeared
with
green
down
the
sleeves
;
his
hair
disordered
,
and
as
it
*NL*
seemed
to
me
greyer
--
either
with
dust
and
dirt
or
because
its
colour
*NL*
had
actually
faded
.
His
face
was
ghastly
pale
;
his
chin
had
a
brown
*NL*
cut
on
it
--
a
cut
half
healed
;
his
expression
was
haggard
and
drawn
,
*NL*
as
by
intense
suffering
.
For
a
moment
he
hesitated
in
the
doorway
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
been
dazzled
by
the
light
.
Then
he
came
into
the
room
.
*NL*
He
walked
with
just
such
a
limp
as
I
have
seen
in
footsore
tramps
.
*NL*
We
stared
at
him
in
silence
,
expecting
him
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
not
a
word
,
but
came
painfully
to
the
table
,
and
made
a
*NL*
motion
towards
the
wine
.
The
Editor
filled
a
glass
of
champagne
,
and
*NL*
pushed
it
towards
him
.
He
drained
it
,
and
it
seemed
to
do
him
good
:
*NL*
for
he
looked
round
the
table
,
and
the
ghost
of
his
old
smile
*NL*
flickered
across
his
face
.
`
What
on
earth
have
you
been
up
to
,
man
?
'
*NL*
said
the
Doctor
.
The
Time
Traveller
did
not
seem
to
hear
.
`
Do
n't
let
*NL*
me
disturb
you
,
'
he
said
,
with
a
certain
faltering
articulation
.
*NL*
`
I
'm
all
right
.
'
He
stopped
,
held
out
his
glass
for
more
,
and
took
*NL*
it
off
at
a
draught
.
`
That
's
good
,
'
he
said
.
His
eyes
grew
brighter
,
*NL*
and
a
faint
colour
came
into
his
cheeks
.
His
glance
flickered
over
*NL*
our
faces
with
a
certain
dull
approval
,
and
then
went
round
the
warm
*NL*
and
comfortable
room
.
Then
he
spoke
again
,
still
as
it
were
feeling
*NL*
his
way
among
his
words
.
`
I
'm
going
to
wash
and
dress
,
and
then
I
'll
*NL*
come
down
and
explain
things
...
Save
me
some
of
that
mutton
.
I
'm
*NL*
starving
for
a
bit
of
meat
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
across
at
the
Editor
,
who
was
a
rare
visitor
,
and
hoped
he
*NL*
was
all
right
.
The
Editor
began
a
question
.
`
Tell
you
presently
,
'
*NL*
said
the
Time
Traveller
.
`
I
'm
--
funny
!
Be
all
right
in
a
minute
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
down
his
glass
,
and
walked
towards
the
staircase
door
.
Again
*NL*
I
remarked
his
lameness
and
the
soft
padding
sound
of
his
footfall
,
*NL*
and
standing
up
in
my
place
,
I
saw
his
feet
as
he
went
out
.
He
had
*NL*
nothing
on
them
but
a
pair
of
tattered
,
blood-stained
socks
.
Then
the
*NL*
door
closed
upon
him
.
I
had
half
a
mind
to
follow
,
till
I
remembered
*NL*
how
he
detested
any
fuss
about
himself
.
For
a
minute
,
perhaps
,
my
*NL*
mind
was
wool-gathering
.
Then
,
`
Remarkable
Behaviour
of
an
Eminent
*NL*
Scientist
,
'
I
heard
the
Editor
say
,
thinking
-LRB-
after
his
wont
-RRB-
in
*NL*
headlines
.
And
this
brought
my
attention
back
to
the
bright
*NL*
dinner-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
the
game
?
'
said
the
Journalist
.
`
Has
he
been
doing
the
*NL*
Amateur
Cadger
?
I
do
n't
follow
.
'
I
met
the
eye
of
the
Psychologist
,
*NL*
and
read
my
own
interpretation
in
his
face
.
I
thought
of
the
Time
*NL*
Traveller
limping
painfully
upstairs
.
I
do
n't
think
any
one
else
had
*NL*
noticed
his
lameness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
to
recover
completely
from
this
surprise
was
the
Medical
*NL*
Man
,
who
rang
the
bell
--
the
Time
Traveller
hated
to
have
servants
*NL*
waiting
at
dinner
--
for
a
hot
plate
.
At
that
the
Editor
turned
to
his
*NL*
knife
and
fork
with
a
grunt
,
and
the
Silent
Man
followed
suit
.
The
*NL*
dinner
was
resumed
.
Conversation
was
exclamatory
for
a
little
while
,
*NL*
with
gaps
of
wonderment
;
and
then
the
Editor
got
fervent
in
his
*NL*
curiosity
.
`
Does
our
friend
eke
out
his
modest
income
with
a
*NL*
crossing
?
or
has
he
his
Nebuchadnezzar
phases
?
'
he
inquired
.
'
I
feel
*NL*
assured
it
's
this
business
of
the
Time
Machine
,
'
I
said
,
and
took
up
*NL*
the
Psychologist
's
account
of
our
previous
meeting
.
The
new
guests
*NL*
were
frankly
incredulous
.
The
Editor
raised
objections
.
`
What
_
was
_
*NL*
this
time
travelling
?
A
man
could
n't
cover
himself
with
dust
by
*NL*
rolling
in
a
paradox
,
could
he
?
'
And
then
,
as
the
idea
came
home
to
*NL*
him
,
he
resorted
to
caricature
.
Had
n't
they
any
clothes-brushes
in
*NL*
the
Future
?
The
Journalist
too
,
would
not
believe
at
any
price
,
and
*NL*
joined
the
Editor
in
the
easy
work
of
heaping
ridicule
on
the
whole
*NL*
thing
.
They
were
both
the
new
kind
of
journalist
--
very
joyous
,
*NL*
irreverent
young
men
.
`
Our
Special
Correspondent
in
the
Day
*NL*
after
To-morrow
reports
,
'
the
Journalist
was
saying
--
or
rather
*NL*
shouting
--
when
the
Time
Traveller
came
back
.
He
was
dressed
in
*NL*
ordinary
evening
clothes
,
and
nothing
save
his
haggard
look
remained
*NL*
of
the
change
that
had
startled
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
say
,
'
said
the
Editor
hilariously
,
`
these
chaps
here
say
you
have
*NL*
been
travelling
into
the
middle
of
next
week
!
Tell
us
all
about
*NL*
little
Rosebery
,
will
you
?
What
will
you
take
for
the
lot
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
came
to
the
place
reserved
for
him
without
a
*NL*
word
.
He
smiled
quietly
,
in
his
old
way
.
`
Where
's
my
mutton
?
'
he
*NL*
said
.
`
What
a
treat
it
is
to
stick
a
fork
into
meat
again
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Story
!
'
cried
the
Editor
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Story
be
damned
!
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
.
'
I
want
something
to
*NL*
eat
.
I
wo
n't
say
a
word
until
I
get
some
peptone
into
my
arteries
.
*NL*
Thanks
.
And
the
salt
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
One
word
,
'
said
I.
`
Have
you
been
time
travelling
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
the
Time
Traveller
,
with
his
mouth
full
,
nodding
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'd
give
a
shilling
a
line
for
a
verbatim
note
,
'
said
the
Editor
.
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
pushed
his
glass
towards
the
Silent
Man
and
rang
*NL*
it
with
his
fingernail
;
at
which
the
Silent
Man
,
who
had
been
*NL*
staring
at
his
face
,
started
convulsively
,
and
poured
him
wine
.
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
dinner
was
uncomfortable
.
For
my
own
part
,
sudden
*NL*
questions
kept
on
rising
to
my
lips
,
and
I
dare
say
it
was
the
same
*NL*
with
the
others
.
The
Journalist
tried
to
relieve
the
tension
by
*NL*
telling
anecdotes
of
Hettie
Potter
.
The
Time
Traveller
devoted
his
*NL*
attention
to
his
dinner
,
and
displayed
the
appetite
of
a
tramp
.
*NL*
The
Medical
Man
smoked
a
cigarette
,
and
watched
the
Time
Traveller
*NL*
through
his
eyelashes
.
The
Silent
Man
seemed
even
more
clumsy
than
*NL*
usual
,
and
drank
champagne
with
regularity
and
determination
out
of
*NL*
sheer
nervousness
.
At
last
the
Time
Traveller
pushed
his
plate
away
,
*NL*
and
looked
round
us
.
'
I
suppose
I
must
apologize
,
'
he
said
.
'
I
was
*NL*
simply
starving
.
I
've
had
a
most
amazing
time
.
'
He
reached
out
his
*NL*
hand
for
a
cigar
,
and
cut
the
end
.
`
But
come
into
the
smoking-room
.
*NL*
It
's
too
long
a
story
to
tell
over
greasy
plates
.
'
And
ringing
the
*NL*
bell
in
passing
,
he
led
the
way
into
the
adjoining
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
have
told
Blank
,
and
Dash
,
and
Chose
about
the
machine
?
'
he
*NL*
said
to
me
,
leaning
back
in
his
easy-chair
and
naming
the
three
new
*NL*
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
the
thing
's
a
mere
paradox
,
'
said
the
Editor
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
argue
to-night
.
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
the
story
,
but
*NL*
I
ca
n't
argue
.
I
will
,
'
he
went
on
,
`
tell
you
the
story
of
what
*NL*
has
happened
to
me
,
if
you
like
,
but
you
must
refrain
from
*NL*
interruptions
.
I
want
to
tell
it
.
Badly
.
Most
of
it
will
sound
like
*NL*
lying
.
So
be
it
!
It
's
true
--
every
word
of
it
,
all
the
same
.
I
was
in
*NL*
my
laboratory
at
four
o'clock
,
and
since
then
...
I
've
lived
eight
*NL*
days
...
such
days
as
no
human
being
ever
lived
before
!
I
'm
nearly
*NL*
worn
out
,
but
I
sha
n't
sleep
till
I
've
told
this
thing
over
to
you
.
*NL*
Then
I
shall
go
to
bed
.
But
no
interruptions
!
Is
it
agreed
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Agreed
,
'
said
the
Editor
,
and
the
rest
of
us
echoed
`
Agreed
.
'
And
*NL*
with
that
the
Time
Traveller
began
his
story
as
I
have
set
it
forth
.
*NL*
He
sat
back
in
his
chair
at
first
,
and
spoke
like
a
weary
man
.
*NL*
Afterwards
he
got
more
animated
.
In
writing
it
down
I
feel
with
only
*NL*
too
much
keenness
the
inadequacy
of
pen
and
ink
--
and
,
above
all
,
my
*NL*
own
inadequacy
--
to
express
its
quality
.
You
read
,
I
will
suppose
,
*NL*
attentively
enough
;
but
you
can
not
see
the
speaker
's
white
,
*NL*
sincere
face
in
the
bright
circle
of
the
little
lamp
,
nor
hear
the
*NL*
intonation
of
his
voice
.
You
can
not
know
how
his
expression
followed
*NL*
the
turns
of
his
story
!
Most
of
us
hearers
were
in
shadow
,
for
the
*NL*
candles
in
the
smoking-room
had
not
been
lighted
,
and
only
the
face
*NL*
of
the
Journalist
and
the
legs
of
the
Silent
Man
from
the
knees
*NL*
downward
were
illuminated
.
At
first
we
glanced
now
and
again
at
each
*NL*
other
.
After
a
time
we
ceased
to
do
that
,
and
looked
only
at
the
*NL*
Time
Traveller
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
told
some
of
you
last
Thursday
of
the
principles
of
the
Time
*NL*
Machine
,
and
showed
you
the
actual
thing
itself
,
incomplete
in
the
*NL*
workshop
.
There
it
is
now
,
a
little
travel-worn
,
truly
;
and
one
of
*NL*
the
ivory
bars
is
cracked
,
and
a
brass
rail
bent
;
but
the
rest
of
*NL*
it
's
sound
enough
.
I
expected
to
finish
it
on
Friday
,
but
on
Friday
,
*NL*
when
the
putting
together
was
nearly
done
,
I
found
that
one
of
the
*NL*
nickel
bars
was
exactly
one
inch
too
short
,
and
this
I
had
to
get
*NL*
remade
;
so
that
the
thing
was
not
complete
until
this
morning
.
It
*NL*
was
at
ten
o'clock
to-day
that
the
first
of
all
Time
Machines
began
*NL*
its
career
.
I
gave
it
a
last
tap
,
tried
all
the
screws
again
,
put
*NL*
one
more
drop
of
oil
on
the
quartz
rod
,
and
sat
myself
in
the
*NL*
saddle
.
I
suppose
a
suicide
who
holds
a
pistol
to
his
skull
feels
*NL*
much
the
same
wonder
at
what
will
come
next
as
I
felt
then
.
I
took
*NL*
the
starting
lever
in
one
hand
and
the
stopping
one
in
the
other
,
*NL*
pressed
the
first
,
and
almost
immediately
the
second
.
I
seemed
to
*NL*
reel
;
I
felt
a
nightmare
sensation
of
falling
;
and
,
looking
round
,
*NL*
I
saw
the
laboratory
exactly
as
before
.
Had
anything
happened
?
For
*NL*
a
moment
I
suspected
that
my
intellect
had
tricked
me
.
Then
I
noted
*NL*
the
clock
.
A
moment
before
,
as
it
seemed
,
it
had
stood
at
a
minute
*NL*
or
so
past
ten
;
now
it
was
nearly
half-past
three
!
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
drew
a
breath
,
set
my
teeth
,
gripped
the
starting
lever
with
both
*NL*
hands
,
and
went
off
with
a
thud
.
The
laboratory
got
hazy
and
went
*NL*
dark
.
Mrs.
Watchett
came
in
and
walked
,
apparently
without
seeing
*NL*
me
,
towards
the
garden
door
.
I
suppose
it
took
her
a
minute
or
so
to
*NL*
traverse
the
place
,
but
to
me
she
seemed
to
shoot
across
the
room
*NL*
like
a
rocket
.
I
pressed
the
lever
over
to
its
extreme
position
.
The
*NL*
night
came
like
the
turning
out
of
a
lamp
,
and
in
another
moment
*NL*
came
to-morrow
.
The
laboratory
grew
faint
and
hazy
,
then
fainter
*NL*
and
ever
fainter
.
To-morrow
night
came
black
,
then
day
again
,
night
*NL*
again
,
day
again
,
faster
and
faster
still
.
An
eddying
murmur
filled
*NL*
my
ears
,
and
a
strange
,
dumb
confusedness
descended
on
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
afraid
I
can
not
convey
the
peculiar
sensations
of
time
*NL*
travelling
.
They
are
excessively
unpleasant
.
There
is
a
feeling
*NL*
exactly
like
that
one
has
upon
a
switchback
--
of
a
helpless
headlong
*NL*
motion
!
I
felt
the
same
horrible
anticipation
,
too
,
of
an
imminent
*NL*
smash
.
As
I
put
on
pace
,
night
followed
day
like
the
flapping
of
a
*NL*
black
wing
.
The
dim
suggestion
of
the
laboratory
seemed
presently
to
*NL*
fall
away
from
me
,
and
I
saw
the
sun
hopping
swiftly
across
the
sky
,
*NL*
leaping
it
every
minute
,
and
every
minute
marking
a
day
.
I
supposed
*NL*
the
laboratory
had
been
destroyed
and
I
had
come
into
the
open
air
.
*NL*
I
had
a
dim
impression
of
scaffolding
,
but
I
was
already
going
too
*NL*
fast
to
be
conscious
of
any
moving
things
.
The
slowest
snail
that
*NL*
ever
crawled
dashed
by
too
fast
for
me
.
The
twinkling
succession
of
*NL*
darkness
and
light
was
excessively
painful
to
the
eye
.
Then
,
in
the
*NL*
intermittent
darknesses
,
I
saw
the
moon
spinning
swiftly
through
her
*NL*
quarters
from
new
to
full
,
and
had
a
faint
glimpse
of
the
circling
*NL*
stars
.
Presently
,
as
I
went
on
,
still
gaining
velocity
,
the
*NL*
palpitation
of
night
and
day
merged
into
one
continuous
greyness
;
*NL*
the
sky
took
on
a
wonderful
deepness
of
blue
,
a
splendid
luminous
*NL*
color
like
that
of
early
twilight
;
the
jerking
sun
became
a
streak
*NL*
of
fire
,
a
brilliant
arch
,
in
space
;
the
moon
a
fainter
fluctuating
*NL*
band
;
and
I
could
see
nothing
of
the
stars
,
save
now
and
then
a
*NL*
brighter
circle
flickering
in
the
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
landscape
was
misty
and
vague
.
I
was
still
on
the
hill-side
*NL*
upon
which
this
house
now
stands
,
and
the
shoulder
rose
above
me
*NL*
grey
and
dim
.
I
saw
trees
growing
and
changing
like
puffs
of
vapour
,
*NL*
now
brown
,
now
green
;
they
grew
,
spread
,
shivered
,
and
passed
away
.
*NL*
I
saw
huge
buildings
rise
up
faint
and
fair
,
and
pass
like
dreams
.
*NL*
The
whole
surface
of
the
earth
seemed
changed
--
melting
and
flowing
*NL*
under
my
eyes
.
The
little
hands
upon
the
dials
that
registered
my
*NL*
speed
raced
round
faster
and
faster
.
Presently
I
noted
that
the
sun
*NL*
belt
swayed
up
and
down
,
from
solstice
to
solstice
,
in
a
minute
or
*NL*
less
,
and
that
consequently
my
pace
was
over
a
year
a
minute
;
and
*NL*
minute
by
minute
the
white
snow
flashed
across
the
world
,
and
*NL*
vanished
,
and
was
followed
by
the
bright
,
brief
green
of
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
unpleasant
sensations
of
the
start
were
less
poignant
now
.
They
*NL*
merged
at
last
into
a
kind
of
hysterical
exhilaration
.
I
remarked
*NL*
indeed
a
clumsy
swaying
of
the
machine
,
for
which
I
was
unable
to
*NL*
account
.
But
my
mind
was
too
confused
to
attend
to
it
,
so
with
a
*NL*
kind
of
madness
growing
upon
me
,
I
flung
myself
into
futurity
.
At
*NL*
first
I
scarce
thought
of
stopping
,
scarce
thought
of
anything
but
*NL*
these
new
sensations
.
But
presently
a
fresh
series
of
impressions
*NL*
grew
up
in
my
mind
--
a
certain
curiosity
and
therewith
a
certain
*NL*
dread
--
until
at
last
they
took
complete
possession
of
me
.
What
*NL*
strange
developments
of
humanity
,
what
wonderful
advances
upon
our
*NL*
rudimentary
civilization
,
I
thought
,
might
not
appear
when
I
came
to
*NL*
look
nearly
into
the
dim
elusive
world
that
raced
and
fluctuated
*NL*
before
my
eyes
!
I
saw
great
and
splendid
architecture
rising
about
*NL*
me
,
more
massive
than
any
buildings
of
our
own
time
,
and
yet
,
as
it
*NL*
seemed
,
built
of
glimmer
and
mist
.
I
saw
a
richer
green
flow
up
the
*NL*
hill-side
,
and
remain
there
,
without
any
wintry
intermission
.
Even
*NL*
through
the
veil
of
my
confusion
the
earth
seemed
very
fair
.
And
so
*NL*
my
mind
came
round
to
the
business
of
stopping
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
peculiar
risk
lay
in
the
possibility
of
my
finding
some
*NL*
substance
in
the
space
which
I
,
or
the
machine
,
occupied
.
So
long
*NL*
as
I
travelled
at
a
high
velocity
through
time
,
this
scarcely
*NL*
mattered
;
I
was
,
so
to
speak
,
attenuated
--
was
slipping
like
a
vapour
*NL*
through
the
interstices
of
intervening
substances
!
But
to
come
to
*NL*
a
stop
involved
the
jamming
of
myself
,
molecule
by
molecule
,
into
*NL*
whatever
lay
in
my
way
;
meant
bringing
my
atoms
into
such
intimate
*NL*
contact
with
those
of
the
obstacle
that
a
profound
chemical
*NL*
reaction
--
possibly
a
far-reaching
explosion
--
would
result
,
and
blow
*NL*
myself
and
my
apparatus
out
of
all
possible
dimensions
--
into
the
*NL*
Unknown
.
This
possibility
had
occurred
to
me
again
and
again
while
I
*NL*
was
making
the
machine
;
but
then
I
had
cheerfully
accepted
it
as
an
*NL*
unavoidable
risk
--
one
of
the
risks
a
man
has
got
to
take
!
Now
the
*NL*
risk
was
inevitable
,
I
no
longer
saw
it
in
the
same
cheerful
light
.
*NL*
The
fact
is
that
,
insensibly
,
the
absolute
strangeness
of
everything
,
*NL*
the
sickly
jarring
and
swaying
of
the
machine
,
above
all
,
the
*NL*
feeling
of
prolonged
falling
,
had
absolutely
upset
my
nerve
.
I
told
*NL*
myself
that
I
could
never
stop
,
and
with
a
gust
of
petulance
I
*NL*
resolved
to
stop
forthwith
.
Like
an
impatient
fool
,
I
lugged
over
*NL*
the
lever
,
and
incontinently
the
thing
went
reeling
over
,
and
I
was
*NL*
flung
headlong
through
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
was
the
sound
of
a
clap
of
thunder
in
my
ears
.
I
may
have
*NL*
been
stunned
for
a
moment
.
A
pitiless
hail
was
hissing
round
me
,
*NL*
and
I
was
sitting
on
soft
turf
in
front
of
the
overset
machine
.
*NL*
Everything
still
seemed
grey
,
but
presently
I
remarked
that
the
*NL*
confusion
in
my
ears
was
gone
.
I
looked
round
me
.
I
was
on
what
*NL*
seemed
to
be
a
little
lawn
in
a
garden
,
surrounded
by
rhododendron
*NL*
bushes
,
and
I
noticed
that
their
mauve
and
purple
blossoms
were
*NL*
dropping
in
a
shower
under
the
beating
of
the
hail-stones
.
The
*NL*
rebounding
,
dancing
hail
hung
in
a
cloud
over
the
machine
,
and
drove
*NL*
along
the
ground
like
smoke
.
In
a
moment
I
was
wet
to
the
skin
.
*NL*
``
Fine
hospitality
,
''
said
I
,
``
to
a
man
who
has
travelled
innumerable
*NL*
years
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Presently
I
thought
what
a
fool
I
was
to
get
wet
.
I
stood
up
and
*NL*
looked
round
me
.
A
colossal
figure
,
carved
apparently
in
some
white
*NL*
stone
,
loomed
indistinctly
beyond
the
rhododendrons
through
the
hazy
*NL*
downpour
.
But
all
else
of
the
world
was
invisible
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
sensations
would
be
hard
to
describe
.
As
the
columns
of
hail
*NL*
grew
thinner
,
I
saw
the
white
figure
more
distinctly
.
It
was
very
*NL*
large
,
for
a
silver
birch-tree
touched
its
shoulder
.
It
was
of
white
*NL*
marble
,
in
shape
something
like
a
winged
sphinx
,
but
the
wings
,
*NL*
instead
of
being
carried
vertically
at
the
sides
,
were
spread
so
*NL*
that
it
seemed
to
hover
.
The
pedestal
,
it
appeared
to
me
,
was
of
*NL*
bronze
,
and
was
thick
with
verdigris
.
It
chanced
that
the
face
was
*NL*
towards
me
;
the
sightless
eyes
seemed
to
watch
me
;
there
was
the
*NL*
faint
shadow
of
a
smile
on
the
lips
.
It
was
greatly
weather-worn
,
*NL*
and
that
imparted
an
unpleasant
suggestion
of
disease
.
I
stood
*NL*
looking
at
it
for
a
little
space
--
half
a
minute
,
perhaps
,
or
half
an
*NL*
hour
.
It
seemed
to
advance
and
to
recede
as
the
hail
drove
before
it
*NL*
denser
or
thinner
.
At
last
I
tore
my
eyes
from
it
for
a
moment
and
*NL*
saw
that
the
hail
curtain
had
worn
threadbare
,
and
that
the
sky
was
*NL*
lightening
with
the
promise
of
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
looked
up
again
at
the
crouching
white
shape
,
and
the
full
*NL*
temerity
of
my
voyage
came
suddenly
upon
me
.
What
might
appear
when
*NL*
that
hazy
curtain
was
altogether
withdrawn
?
What
might
not
have
*NL*
happened
to
men
?
What
if
cruelty
had
grown
into
a
common
passion
?
*NL*
What
if
in
this
interval
the
race
had
lost
its
manliness
and
had
*NL*
developed
into
something
inhuman
,
unsympathetic
,
and
overwhelmingly
*NL*
powerful
?
I
might
seem
some
old-world
savage
animal
,
only
the
more
*NL*
dreadful
and
disgusting
for
our
common
likeness
--
a
foul
creature
to
*NL*
be
incontinently
slain
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Already
I
saw
other
vast
shapes
--
huge
buildings
with
intricate
*NL*
parapets
and
tall
columns
,
with
a
wooded
hill-side
dimly
creeping
*NL*
in
upon
me
through
the
lessening
storm
.
I
was
seized
with
a
panic
*NL*
fear
.
I
turned
frantically
to
the
Time
Machine
,
and
strove
hard
to
*NL*
readjust
it
.
As
I
did
so
the
shafts
of
the
sun
smote
through
the
*NL*
thunderstorm
.
The
grey
downpour
was
swept
aside
and
vanished
like
*NL*
the
trailing
garments
of
a
ghost
.
Above
me
,
in
the
intense
blue
*NL*
of
the
summer
sky
,
some
faint
brown
shreds
of
cloud
whirled
into
*NL*
nothingness
.
The
great
buildings
about
me
stood
out
clear
and
*NL*
distinct
,
shining
with
the
wet
of
the
thunderstorm
,
and
picked
out
*NL*
in
white
by
the
unmelted
hailstones
piled
along
their
courses
.
I
*NL*
felt
naked
in
a
strange
world
.
I
felt
as
perhaps
a
bird
may
feel
in
*NL*
the
clear
air
,
knowing
the
hawk
wings
above
and
will
swoop
.
My
fear
*NL*
grew
to
frenzy
.
I
took
a
breathing
space
,
set
my
teeth
,
and
again
*NL*
grappled
fiercely
,
wrist
and
knee
,
with
the
machine
.
It
gave
under
*NL*
my
desperate
onset
and
turned
over
.
It
struck
my
chin
violently
.
One
*NL*
hand
on
the
saddle
,
the
other
on
the
lever
,
I
stood
panting
heavily
*NL*
in
attitude
to
mount
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
with
this
recovery
of
a
prompt
retreat
my
courage
recovered
.
I
*NL*
looked
more
curiously
and
less
fearfully
at
this
world
of
the
remote
*NL*
future
.
In
a
circular
opening
,
high
up
in
the
wall
of
the
nearer
*NL*
house
,
I
saw
a
group
of
figures
clad
in
rich
soft
robes
.
They
had
*NL*
seen
me
,
and
their
faces
were
directed
towards
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
heard
voices
approaching
me
.
Coming
through
the
bushes
by
*NL*
the
White
Sphinx
were
the
heads
and
shoulders
of
men
running
.
One
of
*NL*
these
emerged
in
a
pathway
leading
straight
to
the
little
lawn
upon
*NL*
which
I
stood
with
my
machine
.
He
was
a
slight
creature
--
perhaps
*NL*
four
feet
high
--
clad
in
a
purple
tunic
,
girdled
at
the
waist
with
a
*NL*
leather
belt
.
Sandals
or
buskins
--
I
could
not
clearly
distinguish
*NL*
which
--
were
on
his
feet
;
his
legs
were
bare
to
the
knees
,
and
his
*NL*
head
was
bare
.
Noticing
that
,
I
noticed
for
the
first
time
how
warm
*NL*
the
air
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
struck
me
as
being
a
very
beautiful
and
graceful
creature
,
but
*NL*
indescribably
frail
.
His
flushed
face
reminded
me
of
the
more
*NL*
beautiful
kind
of
consumptive
--
that
hectic
beauty
of
which
we
used
*NL*
to
hear
so
much
.
At
the
sight
of
him
I
suddenly
regained
confidence
.
*NL*
I
took
my
hands
from
the
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
another
moment
we
were
standing
face
to
face
,
I
and
this
fragile
*NL*
thing
out
of
futurity
.
He
came
straight
up
to
me
and
laughed
into
my
*NL*
eyes
.
The
absence
from
his
bearing
of
any
sign
of
fear
struck
me
at
*NL*
once
.
Then
he
turned
to
the
two
others
who
were
following
him
and
*NL*
spoke
to
them
in
a
strange
and
very
sweet
and
liquid
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
were
others
coming
,
and
presently
a
little
group
of
perhaps
*NL*
eight
or
ten
of
these
exquisite
creatures
were
about
me
.
One
of
them
*NL*
addressed
me
.
It
came
into
my
head
,
oddly
enough
,
that
my
voice
was
*NL*
too
harsh
and
deep
for
them
.
So
I
shook
my
head
,
and
,
pointing
to
my
*NL*
ears
,
shook
it
again
.
He
came
a
step
forward
,
hesitated
,
and
then
*NL*
touched
my
hand
.
Then
I
felt
other
soft
little
tentacles
upon
my
*NL*
back
and
shoulders
.
They
wanted
to
make
sure
I
was
real
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
in
this
at
all
alarming
.
Indeed
,
there
was
something
in
*NL*
these
pretty
little
people
that
inspired
confidence
--
a
graceful
*NL*
gentleness
,
a
certain
childlike
ease
.
And
besides
,
they
looked
so
*NL*
frail
that
I
could
fancy
myself
flinging
the
whole
dozen
of
them
*NL*
about
like
nine-pins
.
But
I
made
a
sudden
motion
to
warn
them
when
I
*NL*
saw
their
little
pink
hands
feeling
at
the
Time
Machine
.
Happily
*NL*
then
,
when
it
was
not
too
late
,
I
thought
of
a
danger
I
had
hitherto
*NL*
forgotten
,
and
reaching
over
the
bars
of
the
machine
I
unscrewed
the
*NL*
little
levers
that
would
set
it
in
motion
,
and
put
these
in
my
*NL*
pocket
.
Then
I
turned
again
to
see
what
I
could
do
in
the
way
of
*NL*
communication
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
then
,
looking
more
nearly
into
their
features
,
I
saw
some
*NL*
further
peculiarities
in
their
Dresden-china
type
of
prettiness
.
*NL*
Their
hair
,
which
was
uniformly
curly
,
came
to
a
sharp
end
at
the
*NL*
neck
and
cheek
;
there
was
not
the
faintest
suggestion
of
it
on
the
*NL*
face
,
and
their
ears
were
singularly
minute
.
The
mouths
were
small
,
*NL*
with
bright
red
,
rather
thin
lips
,
and
the
little
chins
ran
to
a
*NL*
point
.
The
eyes
were
large
and
mild
;
and
--
this
may
seem
egotism
on
*NL*
my
part
--
I
fancied
even
that
there
was
a
certain
lack
of
the
*NL*
interest
I
might
have
expected
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
they
made
no
effort
to
communicate
with
me
,
but
simply
stood
*NL*
round
me
smiling
and
speaking
in
soft
cooing
notes
to
each
other
,
I
*NL*
began
the
conversation
.
I
pointed
to
the
Time
Machine
and
to
myself
.
*NL*
Then
hesitating
for
a
moment
how
to
express
time
,
I
pointed
to
the
*NL*
sun
.
At
once
a
quaintly
pretty
little
figure
in
chequered
purple
and
*NL*
white
followed
my
gesture
,
and
then
astonished
me
by
imitating
the
*NL*
sound
of
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
a
moment
I
was
staggered
,
though
the
import
of
his
gesture
was
*NL*
plain
enough
.
The
question
had
come
into
my
mind
abruptly
:
were
*NL*
these
creatures
fools
?
You
may
hardly
understand
how
it
took
me
.
*NL*
You
see
I
had
always
anticipated
that
the
people
of
the
year
Eight
*NL*
Hundred
and
Two
Thousand
odd
would
be
incredibly
in
front
of
us
in
*NL*
knowledge
,
art
,
everything
.
Then
one
of
them
suddenly
asked
me
a
*NL*
question
that
showed
him
to
be
on
the
intellectual
level
of
one
of
*NL*
our
five-year-old
children
--
asked
me
,
in
fact
,
if
I
had
come
from
*NL*
the
sun
in
a
thunderstorm
!
It
let
loose
the
judgment
I
had
suspended
*NL*
upon
their
clothes
,
their
frail
light
limbs
,
and
fragile
features
.
*NL*
A
flow
of
disappointment
rushed
across
my
mind
.
For
a
moment
I
felt
*NL*
that
I
had
built
the
Time
Machine
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
nodded
,
pointed
to
the
sun
,
and
gave
them
such
a
vivid
rendering
*NL*
of
a
thunderclap
as
startled
them
.
They
all
withdrew
a
pace
or
so
*NL*
and
bowed
.
Then
came
one
laughing
towards
me
,
carrying
a
chain
of
*NL*
beautiful
flowers
altogether
new
to
me
,
and
put
it
about
my
neck
.
*NL*
The
idea
was
received
with
melodious
applause
;
and
presently
they
*NL*
were
all
running
to
and
fro
for
flowers
,
and
laughingly
flinging
*NL*
them
upon
me
until
I
was
almost
smothered
with
blossom
.
You
who
*NL*
have
never
seen
the
like
can
scarcely
imagine
what
delicate
and
*NL*
wonderful
flowers
countless
years
of
culture
had
created
.
Then
*NL*
someone
suggested
that
their
plaything
should
be
exhibited
in
the
*NL*
nearest
building
,
and
so
I
was
led
past
the
sphinx
of
white
marble
,
*NL*
which
had
seemed
to
watch
me
all
the
while
with
a
smile
at
my
*NL*
astonishment
,
towards
a
vast
grey
edifice
of
fretted
stone
.
As
I
*NL*
went
with
them
the
memory
of
my
confident
anticipations
of
a
*NL*
profoundly
grave
and
intellectual
posterity
came
,
with
irresistible
*NL*
merriment
,
to
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
building
had
a
huge
entry
,
and
was
altogether
of
colossal
*NL*
dimensions
.
I
was
naturally
most
occupied
with
the
growing
crowd
of
*NL*
little
people
,
and
with
the
big
open
portals
that
yawned
before
me
*NL*
shadowy
and
mysterious
.
My
general
impression
of
the
world
I
saw
*NL*
over
their
heads
was
a
tangled
waste
of
beautiful
bushes
and
*NL*
flowers
,
a
long
neglected
and
yet
weedless
garden
.
I
saw
a
number
*NL*
of
tall
spikes
of
strange
white
flowers
,
measuring
a
foot
perhaps
*NL*
across
the
spread
of
the
waxen
petals
.
They
grew
scattered
,
as
if
*NL*
wild
,
among
the
variegated
shrubs
,
but
,
as
I
say
,
I
did
not
examine
*NL*
them
closely
at
this
time
.
The
Time
Machine
was
left
deserted
on
the
*NL*
turf
among
the
rhododendrons
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
arch
of
the
doorway
was
richly
carved
,
but
naturally
I
did
*NL*
not
observe
the
carving
very
narrowly
,
though
I
fancied
I
saw
*NL*
suggestions
of
old
Phoenician
decorations
as
I
passed
through
,
and
*NL*
it
struck
me
that
they
were
very
badly
broken
and
weather-worn
.
*NL*
Several
more
brightly
clad
people
met
me
in
the
doorway
,
and
so
we
*NL*
entered
,
I
,
dressed
in
dingy
nineteenth-century
garments
,
looking
*NL*
grotesque
enough
,
garlanded
with
flowers
,
and
surrounded
by
an
*NL*
eddying
mass
of
bright
,
soft-colored
robes
and
shining
white
limbs
,
*NL*
in
a
melodious
whirl
of
laughter
and
laughing
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
big
doorway
opened
into
a
proportionately
great
hall
hung
with
*NL*
brown
.
The
roof
was
in
shadow
,
and
the
windows
,
partially
glazed
*NL*
with
coloured
glass
and
partially
unglazed
,
admitted
a
tempered
*NL*
light
.
The
floor
was
made
up
of
huge
blocks
of
some
very
hard
white
*NL*
metal
,
not
plates
nor
slabs
--
blocks
,
and
it
was
so
much
worn
,
as
I
*NL*
judged
by
the
going
to
and
fro
of
past
generations
,
as
to
be
deeply
*NL*
channelled
along
the
more
frequented
ways
.
Transverse
to
the
length
*NL*
were
innumerable
tables
made
of
slabs
of
polished
stone
,
raised
*NL*
perhaps
a
foot
from
the
floor
,
and
upon
these
were
heaps
of
fruits
.
*NL*
Some
I
recognized
as
a
kind
of
hypertrophied
raspberry
and
orange
,
*NL*
but
for
the
most
part
they
were
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Between
the
tables
was
scattered
a
great
number
of
cushions
.
*NL*
Upon
these
my
conductors
seated
themselves
,
signing
for
me
to
do
*NL*
likewise
.
With
a
pretty
absence
of
ceremony
they
began
to
eat
the
*NL*
fruit
with
their
hands
,
flinging
peel
and
stalks
,
and
so
forth
,
into
*NL*
the
round
openings
in
the
sides
of
the
tables
.
I
was
not
loath
to
*NL*
follow
their
example
,
for
I
felt
thirsty
and
hungry
.
As
I
did
so
I
*NL*
surveyed
the
hall
at
my
leisure
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
perhaps
the
thing
that
struck
me
most
was
its
dilapidated
look
.
*NL*
The
stained-glass
windows
,
which
displayed
only
a
geometrical
*NL*
pattern
,
were
broken
in
many
places
,
and
the
curtains
that
hung
*NL*
across
the
lower
end
were
thick
with
dust
.
And
it
caught
my
eye
that
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
marble
table
near
me
was
fractured
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
the
general
effect
was
extremely
rich
and
picturesque
.
There
were
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
a
couple
of
hundred
people
dining
in
the
hall
,
and
most
of
*NL*
them
,
seated
as
near
to
me
as
they
could
come
,
were
watching
me
with
*NL*
interest
,
their
little
eyes
shining
over
the
fruit
they
were
eating
.
*NL*
All
were
clad
in
the
same
soft
and
yet
strong
,
silky
material
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fruit
,
by
the
by
,
was
all
their
diet
.
These
people
of
the
remote
*NL*
future
were
strict
vegetarians
,
and
while
I
was
with
them
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
some
carnal
cravings
,
I
had
to
be
frugivorous
also
.
Indeed
,
I
*NL*
found
afterwards
that
horses
,
cattle
,
sheep
,
dogs
,
had
followed
the
*NL*
Ichthyosaurus
into
extinction
.
But
the
fruits
were
very
delightful
;
*NL*
one
,
in
particular
,
that
seemed
to
be
in
season
all
the
time
I
was
*NL*
there
--
a
floury
thing
in
a
three-sided
husk
--
was
especially
good
,
*NL*
and
I
made
it
my
staple
.
At
first
I
was
puzzled
by
all
these
strange
*NL*
fruits
,
and
by
the
strange
flowers
I
saw
,
but
later
I
began
to
*NL*
perceive
their
import
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
However
,
I
am
telling
you
of
my
fruit
dinner
in
the
distant
future
*NL*
now
.
So
soon
as
my
appetite
was
a
little
checked
,
I
determined
to
*NL*
make
a
resolute
attempt
to
learn
the
speech
of
these
new
men
of
*NL*
mine
.
Clearly
that
was
the
next
thing
to
do
.
The
fruits
seemed
a
*NL*
convenient
thing
to
begin
upon
,
and
holding
one
of
these
up
I
began
*NL*
a
series
of
interrogative
sounds
and
gestures
.
I
had
some
*NL*
considerable
difficulty
in
conveying
my
meaning
.
At
first
my
efforts
*NL*
met
with
a
stare
of
surprise
or
inextinguishable
laughter
,
but
*NL*
presently
a
fair-haired
little
creature
seemed
to
grasp
my
intention
*NL*
and
repeated
a
name
.
They
had
to
chatter
and
explain
the
business
*NL*
at
great
length
to
each
other
,
and
my
first
attempts
to
make
the
*NL*
exquisite
little
sounds
of
their
language
caused
an
immense
amount
*NL*
of
amusement
.
However
,
I
felt
like
a
schoolmaster
amidst
children
,
*NL*
and
persisted
,
and
presently
I
had
a
score
of
noun
substantives
at
*NL*
least
at
my
command
;
and
then
I
got
to
demonstrative
pronouns
,
and
*NL*
even
the
verb
``
to
eat
.
''
But
it
was
slow
work
,
and
the
little
people
*NL*
soon
tired
and
wanted
to
get
away
from
my
interrogations
,
so
I
*NL*
determined
,
rather
of
necessity
,
to
let
them
give
their
lessons
in
*NL*
little
doses
when
they
felt
inclined
.
And
very
little
doses
I
found
*NL*
they
were
before
long
,
for
I
never
met
people
more
indolent
or
more
*NL*
easily
fatigued
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
queer
thing
I
soon
discovered
about
my
little
hosts
,
and
that
was
*NL*
their
lack
of
interest
.
They
would
come
to
me
with
eager
cries
of
*NL*
astonishment
,
like
children
,
but
like
children
they
would
soon
stop
*NL*
examining
me
and
wander
away
after
some
other
toy
.
The
dinner
and
my
*NL*
conversational
beginnings
ended
,
I
noted
for
the
first
time
that
*NL*
almost
all
those
who
had
surrounded
me
at
first
were
gone
.
It
is
*NL*
odd
,
too
,
how
speedily
I
came
to
disregard
these
little
people
.
I
*NL*
went
out
through
the
portal
into
the
sunlit
world
again
as
soon
as
*NL*
my
hunger
was
satisfied
.
I
was
continually
meeting
more
of
these
men
*NL*
of
the
future
,
who
would
follow
me
a
little
distance
,
chatter
and
*NL*
laugh
about
me
,
and
,
having
smiled
and
gesticulated
in
a
friendly
*NL*
way
,
leave
me
again
to
my
own
devices
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
calm
of
evening
was
upon
the
world
as
I
emerged
from
the
great
*NL*
hall
,
and
the
scene
was
lit
by
the
warm
glow
of
the
setting
sun
.
*NL*
At
first
things
were
very
confusing
.
Everything
was
so
entirely
*NL*
different
from
the
world
I
had
known
--
even
the
flowers
.
The
big
*NL*
building
I
had
left
was
situated
on
the
slope
of
a
broad
river
*NL*
valley
,
but
the
Thames
had
shifted
perhaps
a
mile
from
its
present
*NL*
position
.
I
resolved
to
mount
to
the
summit
of
a
crest
,
perhaps
a
*NL*
mile
and
a
half
away
,
from
which
I
could
get
a
wider
view
of
this
*NL*
our
planet
in
the
year
Eight
Hundred
and
Two
Thousand
Seven
Hundred
*NL*
and
One
A.D.
For
that
,
I
should
explain
,
was
the
date
the
little
*NL*
dials
of
my
machine
recorded
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
I
walked
I
was
watching
for
every
impression
that
could
possibly
*NL*
help
to
explain
the
condition
of
ruinous
splendour
in
which
I
*NL*
found
the
world
--
for
ruinous
it
was
.
A
little
way
up
the
hill
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
was
a
great
heap
of
granite
,
bound
together
by
masses
of
*NL*
aluminium
,
a
vast
labyrinth
of
precipitous
walls
and
crumpled
*NL*
heaps
,
amidst
which
were
thick
heaps
of
very
beautiful
pagoda-like
*NL*
plants
--
nettles
possibly
--
but
wonderfully
tinted
with
brown
about
*NL*
the
leaves
,
and
incapable
of
stinging
.
It
was
evidently
the
derelict
*NL*
remains
of
some
vast
structure
,
to
what
end
built
I
could
not
*NL*
determine
.
It
was
here
that
I
was
destined
,
at
a
later
date
,
to
have
*NL*
a
very
strange
experience
--
the
first
intimation
of
a
still
stranger
*NL*
discovery
--
but
of
that
I
will
speak
in
its
proper
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Looking
round
with
a
sudden
thought
,
from
a
terrace
on
which
I
*NL*
rested
for
a
while
,
I
realized
that
there
were
no
small
houses
to
be
*NL*
seen
.
Apparently
the
single
house
,
and
possibly
even
the
household
,
*NL*
had
vanished
.
Here
and
there
among
the
greenery
were
palace-like
*NL*
buildings
,
but
the
house
and
the
cottage
,
which
form
such
*NL*
characteristic
features
of
our
own
English
landscape
,
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Communism
,
''
said
I
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
on
the
heels
of
that
came
another
thought
.
I
looked
at
the
*NL*
half-dozen
little
figures
that
were
following
me
.
Then
,
in
a
flash
,
*NL*
I
perceived
that
all
had
the
same
form
of
costume
,
the
same
soft
*NL*
hairless
visage
,
and
the
same
girlish
rotundity
of
limb
.
It
may
seem
*NL*
strange
,
perhaps
,
that
I
had
not
noticed
this
before
.
But
everything
*NL*
was
so
strange
.
Now
,
I
saw
the
fact
plainly
enough
.
In
costume
,
and
*NL*
in
all
the
differences
of
texture
and
bearing
that
now
mark
off
the
*NL*
sexes
from
each
other
,
these
people
of
the
future
were
alike
.
And
*NL*
the
children
seemed
to
my
eyes
to
be
but
the
miniatures
of
their
*NL*
parents
.
I
judged
,
then
,
that
the
children
of
that
time
were
*NL*
extremely
precocious
,
physically
at
least
,
and
I
found
afterwards
*NL*
abundant
verification
of
my
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Seeing
the
ease
and
security
in
which
these
people
were
living
,
I
*NL*
felt
that
this
close
resemblance
of
the
sexes
was
after
all
what
*NL*
one
would
expect
;
for
the
strength
of
a
man
and
the
softness
of
a
*NL*
woman
,
the
institution
of
the
family
,
and
the
differentiation
of
*NL*
occupations
are
mere
militant
necessities
of
an
age
of
physical
*NL*
force
;
where
population
is
balanced
and
abundant
,
much
childbearing
*NL*
becomes
an
evil
rather
than
a
blessing
to
the
State
;
where
*NL*
violence
comes
but
rarely
and
off-spring
are
secure
,
there
is
less
*NL*
necessity
--
indeed
there
is
no
necessity
--
for
an
efficient
family
,
*NL*
and
the
specialization
of
the
sexes
with
reference
to
their
*NL*
children
's
needs
disappears
.
We
see
some
beginnings
of
this
even
*NL*
in
our
own
time
,
and
in
this
future
age
it
was
complete
.
This
,
I
*NL*
must
remind
you
,
was
my
speculation
at
the
time
.
Later
,
I
was
to
*NL*
appreciate
how
far
it
fell
short
of
the
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
While
I
was
musing
upon
these
things
,
my
attention
was
attracted
by
*NL*
a
pretty
little
structure
,
like
a
well
under
a
cupola
.
I
thought
in
*NL*
a
transitory
way
of
the
oddness
of
wells
still
existing
,
and
then
*NL*
resumed
the
thread
of
my
speculations
.
There
were
no
large
buildings
*NL*
towards
the
top
of
the
hill
,
and
as
my
walking
powers
were
evidently
*NL*
miraculous
,
I
was
presently
left
alone
for
the
first
time
.
With
a
*NL*
strange
sense
of
freedom
and
adventure
I
pushed
on
up
to
the
crest
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
I
found
a
seat
of
some
yellow
metal
that
I
did
not
recognize
,
*NL*
corroded
in
places
with
a
kind
of
pinkish
rust
and
half
smothered
*NL*
in
soft
moss
,
the
arm-rests
cast
and
filed
into
the
resemblance
of
*NL*
griffins
'
heads
.
I
sat
down
on
it
,
and
I
surveyed
the
broad
view
of
*NL*
our
old
world
under
the
sunset
of
that
long
day
.
It
was
as
sweet
and
*NL*
fair
a
view
as
I
have
ever
seen
.
The
sun
had
already
gone
below
the
*NL*
horizon
and
the
west
was
flaming
gold
,
touched
with
some
horizontal
*NL*
bars
of
purple
and
crimson
.
Below
was
the
valley
of
the
Thames
,
in
*NL*
which
the
river
lay
like
a
band
of
burnished
steel
.
I
have
already
*NL*
spoken
of
the
great
palaces
dotted
about
among
the
variegated
*NL*
greenery
,
some
in
ruins
and
some
still
occupied
.
Here
and
there
rose
*NL*
a
white
or
silvery
figure
in
the
waste
garden
of
the
earth
,
here
and
*NL*
there
came
the
sharp
vertical
line
of
some
cupola
or
obelisk
.
There
*NL*
were
no
hedges
,
no
signs
of
proprietary
rights
,
no
evidences
of
*NL*
agriculture
;
the
whole
earth
had
become
a
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
watching
,
I
began
to
put
my
interpretation
upon
the
things
I
had
*NL*
seen
,
and
as
it
shaped
itself
to
me
that
evening
,
my
interpretation
*NL*
was
something
in
this
way
.
-LRB-
Afterwards
I
found
I
had
got
only
a
*NL*
half-truth
--
or
only
a
glimpse
of
one
facet
of
the
truth
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
had
happened
upon
humanity
upon
the
wane
.
*NL*
The
ruddy
sunset
set
me
thinking
of
the
sunset
of
mankind
.
For
the
*NL*
first
time
I
began
to
realize
an
odd
consequence
of
the
social
*NL*
effort
in
which
we
are
at
present
engaged
.
And
yet
,
come
to
think
,
*NL*
it
is
a
logical
consequence
enough
.
Strength
is
the
outcome
of
need
;
*NL*
security
sets
a
premium
on
feebleness
.
The
work
of
ameliorating
the
*NL*
conditions
of
life
--
the
true
civilizing
process
that
makes
life
more
*NL*
and
more
secure
--
had
gone
steadily
on
to
a
climax
.
One
triumph
of
a
*NL*
united
humanity
over
Nature
had
followed
another
.
Things
that
are
*NL*
now
mere
dreams
had
become
projects
deliberately
put
in
hand
and
*NL*
carried
forward
.
And
the
harvest
was
what
I
saw
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
all
,
the
sanitation
and
the
agriculture
of
to-day
are
still
*NL*
in
the
rudimentary
stage
.
The
science
of
our
time
has
attacked
but
*NL*
a
little
department
of
the
field
of
human
disease
,
but
even
so
,
*NL*
it
spreads
its
operations
very
steadily
and
persistently
.
Our
*NL*
agriculture
and
horticulture
destroy
a
weed
just
here
and
there
and
*NL*
cultivate
perhaps
a
score
or
so
of
wholesome
plants
,
leaving
the
*NL*
greater
number
to
fight
out
a
balance
as
they
can
.
We
improve
our
*NL*
favourite
plants
and
animals
--
and
how
few
they
are
--
gradually
by
*NL*
selective
breeding
;
now
a
new
and
better
peach
,
now
a
seedless
*NL*
grape
,
now
a
sweeter
and
larger
flower
,
now
a
more
convenient
breed
*NL*
of
cattle
.
We
improve
them
gradually
,
because
our
ideals
are
vague
*NL*
and
tentative
,
and
our
knowledge
is
very
limited
;
because
Nature
,
*NL*
too
,
is
shy
and
slow
in
our
clumsy
hands
.
Some
day
all
this
will
*NL*
be
better
organized
,
and
still
better
.
That
is
the
drift
of
the
*NL*
current
in
spite
of
the
eddies
.
The
whole
world
will
be
intelligent
,
*NL*
educated
,
and
co-operating
;
things
will
move
faster
and
faster
*NL*
towards
the
subjugation
of
Nature
.
In
the
end
,
wisely
and
carefully
*NL*
we
shall
readjust
the
balance
of
animal
and
vegetable
life
to
suit
*NL*
our
human
needs
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
adjustment
,
I
say
,
must
have
been
done
,
and
done
well
;
done
*NL*
indeed
for
all
Time
,
in
the
space
of
Time
across
which
my
machine
*NL*
had
leaped
.
The
air
was
free
from
gnats
,
the
earth
from
weeds
or
*NL*
fungi
;
everywhere
were
fruits
and
sweet
and
delightful
flowers
;
*NL*
brilliant
butterflies
flew
hither
and
thither
.
The
ideal
of
*NL*
preventive
medicine
was
attained
.
Diseases
had
been
stamped
out
.
I
*NL*
saw
no
evidence
of
any
contagious
diseases
during
all
my
stay
.
And
I
*NL*
shall
have
to
tell
you
later
that
even
the
processes
of
putrefaction
*NL*
and
decay
had
been
profoundly
affected
by
these
changes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Social
triumphs
,
too
,
had
been
effected
.
I
saw
mankind
housed
in
*NL*
splendid
shelters
,
gloriously
clothed
,
and
as
yet
I
had
found
them
*NL*
engaged
in
no
toil
.
There
were
no
signs
of
struggle
,
neither
social
*NL*
nor
economical
struggle
.
The
shop
,
the
advertisement
,
traffic
,
all
*NL*
that
commerce
which
constitutes
the
body
of
our
world
,
was
gone
.
It
*NL*
was
natural
on
that
golden
evening
that
I
should
jump
at
the
idea
of
*NL*
a
social
paradise
.
The
difficulty
of
increasing
population
had
been
*NL*
met
,
I
guessed
,
and
population
had
ceased
to
increase
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
with
this
change
in
condition
comes
inevitably
adaptations
to
*NL*
the
change
.
What
,
unless
biological
science
is
a
mass
of
errors
,
is
*NL*
the
cause
of
human
intelligence
and
vigour
?
Hardship
and
freedom
:
*NL*
conditions
under
which
the
active
,
strong
,
and
subtle
survive
and
*NL*
the
weaker
go
to
the
wall
;
conditions
that
put
a
premium
upon
the
*NL*
loyal
alliance
of
capable
men
,
upon
self-restraint
,
patience
,
and
*NL*
decision
.
And
the
institution
of
the
family
,
and
the
emotions
that
*NL*
arise
therein
,
the
fierce
jealousy
,
the
tenderness
for
offspring
,
*NL*
parental
self-devotion
,
all
found
their
justification
and
support
in
*NL*
the
imminent
dangers
of
the
young
.
_
Now
_
,
where
are
these
imminent
*NL*
dangers
?
There
is
a
sentiment
arising
,
and
it
will
grow
,
against
*NL*
connubial
jealousy
,
against
fierce
maternity
,
against
passion
*NL*
of
all
sorts
;
unnecessary
things
now
,
and
things
that
make
us
*NL*
uncomfortable
,
savage
survivals
,
discords
in
a
refined
and
pleasant
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
of
the
physical
slightness
of
the
people
,
their
lack
of
*NL*
intelligence
,
and
those
big
abundant
ruins
,
and
it
strengthened
my
*NL*
belief
in
a
perfect
conquest
of
Nature
.
For
after
the
battle
comes
*NL*
Quiet
.
Humanity
had
been
strong
,
energetic
,
and
intelligent
,
and
had
*NL*
used
all
its
abundant
vitality
to
alter
the
conditions
under
which
*NL*
it
lived
.
And
now
came
the
reaction
of
the
altered
conditions
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Under
the
new
conditions
of
perfect
comfort
and
security
,
that
*NL*
restless
energy
,
that
with
us
is
strength
,
would
become
weakness
.
*NL*
Even
in
our
own
time
certain
tendencies
and
desires
,
once
necessary
*NL*
to
survival
,
are
a
constant
source
of
failure
.
Physical
courage
and
*NL*
the
love
of
battle
,
for
instance
,
are
no
great
help
--
may
even
be
*NL*
hindrances
--
to
a
civilized
man
.
And
in
a
state
of
physical
balance
*NL*
and
security
,
power
,
intellectual
as
well
as
physical
,
would
be
out
*NL*
of
place
.
For
countless
years
I
judged
there
had
been
no
danger
of
*NL*
war
or
solitary
violence
,
no
danger
from
wild
beasts
,
no
wasting
*NL*
disease
to
require
strength
of
constitution
,
no
need
of
toil
.
For
*NL*
such
a
life
,
what
we
should
call
the
weak
are
as
well
equipped
as
*NL*
the
strong
,
are
indeed
no
longer
weak
.
Better
equipped
indeed
they
*NL*
are
,
for
the
strong
would
be
fretted
by
an
energy
for
which
there
*NL*
was
no
outlet
.
No
doubt
the
exquisite
beauty
of
the
buildings
I
saw
*NL*
was
the
outcome
of
the
last
surgings
of
the
now
purposeless
energy
*NL*
of
mankind
before
it
settled
down
into
perfect
harmony
with
the
*NL*
conditions
under
which
it
lived
--
the
flourish
of
that
triumph
which
*NL*
began
the
last
great
peace
.
This
has
ever
been
the
fate
of
energy
in
*NL*
security
;
it
takes
to
art
and
to
eroticism
,
and
then
come
languor
*NL*
and
decay
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Even
this
artistic
impetus
would
at
last
die
away
--
had
almost
died
*NL*
in
the
Time
I
saw
.
To
adorn
themselves
with
flowers
,
to
dance
,
to
*NL*
sing
in
the
sunlight
:
so
much
was
left
of
the
artistic
spirit
,
and
*NL*
no
more
.
Even
that
would
fade
in
the
end
into
a
contented
*NL*
inactivity
.
We
are
kept
keen
on
the
grindstone
of
pain
and
*NL*
necessity
,
and
,
it
seemed
to
me
,
that
here
was
that
hateful
*NL*
grindstone
broken
at
last
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
I
stood
there
in
the
gathering
dark
I
thought
that
in
this
*NL*
simple
explanation
I
had
mastered
the
problem
of
the
world
--
mastered
*NL*
the
whole
secret
of
these
delicious
people
.
Possibly
the
checks
they
*NL*
had
devised
for
the
increase
of
population
had
succeeded
too
well
,
*NL*
and
their
numbers
had
rather
diminished
than
kept
stationary
.
*NL*
That
would
account
for
the
abandoned
ruins
.
Very
simple
was
my
*NL*
explanation
,
and
plausible
enough
--
as
most
wrong
theories
are
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
I
stood
there
musing
over
this
too
perfect
triumph
of
man
,
the
*NL*
full
moon
,
yellow
and
gibbous
,
came
up
out
of
an
overflow
of
silver
*NL*
light
in
the
north-east
.
The
bright
little
figures
ceased
to
move
*NL*
about
below
,
a
noiseless
owl
flitted
by
,
and
I
shivered
with
the
*NL*
chill
of
the
night
.
I
determined
to
descend
and
find
where
I
could
*NL*
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
looked
for
the
building
I
knew
.
Then
my
eye
travelled
along
to
*NL*
the
figure
of
the
White
Sphinx
upon
the
pedestal
of
bronze
,
growing
*NL*
distinct
as
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
grew
brighter
.
I
could
see
*NL*
the
silver
birch
against
it
.
There
was
the
tangle
of
rhododendron
*NL*
bushes
,
black
in
the
pale
light
,
and
there
was
the
little
lawn
.
*NL*
I
looked
at
the
lawn
again
.
A
queer
doubt
chilled
my
complacency
.
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
I
stoutly
to
myself
,
``
that
was
not
the
lawn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
it
_
was
_
the
lawn
.
For
the
white
leprous
face
of
the
sphinx
was
*NL*
towards
it
.
Can
you
imagine
what
I
felt
as
this
conviction
came
*NL*
home
to
me
?
But
you
can
not
.
The
Time
Machine
was
gone
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
once
,
like
a
lash
across
the
face
,
came
the
possibility
of
*NL*
losing
my
own
age
,
of
being
left
helpless
in
this
strange
new
world
.
*NL*
The
bare
thought
of
it
was
an
actual
physical
sensation
.
I
could
*NL*
feel
it
grip
me
at
the
throat
and
stop
my
breathing
.
In
another
*NL*
moment
I
was
in
a
passion
of
fear
and
running
with
great
leaping
*NL*
strides
down
the
slope
.
Once
I
fell
headlong
and
cut
my
face
;
I
lost
*NL*
no
time
in
stanching
the
blood
,
but
jumped
up
and
ran
on
,
with
a
*NL*
warm
trickle
down
my
cheek
and
chin
.
All
the
time
I
ran
I
was
saying
*NL*
to
myself
:
``
They
have
moved
it
a
little
,
pushed
it
under
the
bushes
*NL*
out
of
the
way
.
''
Nevertheless
,
I
ran
with
all
my
might
.
All
the
*NL*
time
,
with
the
certainty
that
sometimes
comes
with
excessive
dread
,
*NL*
I
knew
that
such
assurance
was
folly
,
knew
instinctively
that
the
*NL*
machine
was
removed
out
of
my
reach
.
My
breath
came
with
pain
.
I
*NL*
suppose
I
covered
the
whole
distance
from
the
hill
crest
to
the
*NL*
little
lawn
,
two
miles
perhaps
,
in
ten
minutes
.
And
I
am
not
a
young
*NL*
man
.
I
cursed
aloud
,
as
I
ran
,
at
my
confident
folly
in
leaving
the
*NL*
machine
,
wasting
good
breath
thereby
.
I
cried
aloud
,
and
none
*NL*
answered
.
Not
a
creature
seemed
to
be
stirring
in
that
moonlit
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
I
reached
the
lawn
my
worst
fears
were
realized
.
Not
a
trace
*NL*
of
the
thing
was
to
be
seen
.
I
felt
faint
and
cold
when
I
faced
the
*NL*
empty
space
among
the
black
tangle
of
bushes
.
I
ran
round
it
*NL*
furiously
,
as
if
the
thing
might
be
hidden
in
a
corner
,
and
then
*NL*
stopped
abruptly
,
with
my
hands
clutching
my
hair
.
Above
me
towered
*NL*
the
sphinx
,
upon
the
bronze
pedestal
,
white
,
shining
,
leprous
,
in
*NL*
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
.
It
seemed
to
smile
in
mockery
of
my
*NL*
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
might
have
consoled
myself
by
imagining
the
little
people
had
put
*NL*
the
mechanism
in
some
shelter
for
me
,
had
I
not
felt
assured
of
*NL*
their
physical
and
intellectual
inadequacy
.
That
is
what
dismayed
*NL*
me
:
the
sense
of
some
hitherto
unsuspected
power
,
through
whose
*NL*
intervention
my
invention
had
vanished
.
Yet
,
for
one
thing
I
felt
*NL*
assured
:
unless
some
other
age
had
produced
its
exact
duplicate
,
*NL*
the
machine
could
not
have
moved
in
time
.
The
attachment
of
the
*NL*
levers
--
I
will
show
you
the
method
later
--
prevented
any
one
from
*NL*
tampering
with
it
in
that
way
when
they
were
removed
.
It
had
moved
,
*NL*
and
was
hid
,
only
in
space
.
But
then
,
where
could
it
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
I
must
have
had
a
kind
of
frenzy
.
I
remember
running
*NL*
violently
in
and
out
among
the
moonlit
bushes
all
round
the
sphinx
,
*NL*
and
startling
some
white
animal
that
,
in
the
dim
light
,
I
took
for
a
*NL*
small
deer
.
I
remember
,
too
,
late
that
night
,
beating
the
bushes
*NL*
with
my
clenched
fist
until
my
knuckles
were
gashed
and
bleeding
*NL*
from
the
broken
twigs
.
Then
,
sobbing
and
raving
in
my
anguish
of
*NL*
mind
,
I
went
down
to
the
great
building
of
stone
.
The
big
hall
was
*NL*
dark
,
silent
,
and
deserted
.
I
slipped
on
the
uneven
floor
,
and
fell
*NL*
over
one
of
the
malachite
tables
,
almost
breaking
my
shin
.
I
lit
a
*NL*
match
and
went
on
past
the
dusty
curtains
,
of
which
I
have
told
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
I
found
a
second
great
hall
covered
with
cushions
,
upon
*NL*
which
,
perhaps
,
a
score
or
so
of
the
little
people
were
sleeping
.
I
*NL*
have
no
doubt
they
found
my
second
appearance
strange
enough
,
coming
*NL*
suddenly
out
of
the
quiet
darkness
with
inarticulate
noises
and
the
*NL*
splutter
and
flare
of
a
match
.
For
they
had
forgotten
about
matches
.
*NL*
``
Where
is
my
Time
Machine
?
''
I
began
,
bawling
like
an
angry
child
,
*NL*
laying
hands
upon
them
and
shaking
them
up
together
.
It
must
have
*NL*
been
very
queer
to
them
.
Some
laughed
,
most
of
them
looked
sorely
*NL*
frightened
.
When
I
saw
them
standing
round
me
,
it
came
into
my
head
*NL*
that
I
was
doing
as
foolish
a
thing
as
it
was
possible
for
me
to
do
*NL*
under
the
circumstances
,
in
trying
to
revive
the
sensation
of
fear
.
*NL*
For
,
reasoning
from
their
daylight
behaviour
,
I
thought
that
fear
*NL*
must
be
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Abruptly
,
I
dashed
down
the
match
,
and
,
knocking
one
of
the
people
*NL*
over
in
my
course
,
went
blundering
across
the
big
dining-hall
again
,
*NL*
out
under
the
moonlight
.
I
heard
cries
of
terror
and
their
little
*NL*
feet
running
and
stumbling
this
way
and
that
.
I
do
not
remember
all
*NL*
I
did
as
the
moon
crept
up
the
sky
.
I
suppose
it
was
the
unexpected
*NL*
nature
of
my
loss
that
maddened
me
.
I
felt
hopelessly
cut
off
from
*NL*
my
own
kind
--
a
strange
animal
in
an
unknown
world
.
I
must
have
raved
*NL*
to
and
fro
,
screaming
and
crying
upon
God
and
Fate
.
I
have
a
memory
*NL*
of
horrible
fatigue
,
as
the
long
night
of
despair
wore
away
;
of
*NL*
looking
in
this
impossible
place
and
that
;
of
groping
among
moon-lit
*NL*
ruins
and
touching
strange
creatures
in
the
black
shadows
;
at
last
,
*NL*
of
lying
on
the
ground
near
the
sphinx
and
weeping
with
absolute
*NL*
wretchedness
.
I
had
nothing
left
but
misery
.
Then
I
slept
,
and
when
*NL*
I
woke
again
it
was
full
day
,
and
a
couple
of
sparrows
were
hopping
*NL*
round
me
on
the
turf
within
reach
of
my
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
sat
up
in
the
freshness
of
the
morning
,
trying
to
remember
how
*NL*
I
had
got
there
,
and
why
I
had
such
a
profound
sense
of
desertion
*NL*
and
despair
.
Then
things
came
clear
in
my
mind
.
With
the
plain
,
*NL*
reasonable
daylight
,
I
could
look
my
circumstances
fairly
in
the
*NL*
face
.
I
saw
the
wild
folly
of
my
frenzy
overnight
,
and
I
could
*NL*
reason
with
myself
.
``
Suppose
the
worst
?
''
I
said
.
``
Suppose
the
*NL*
machine
altogether
lost
--
perhaps
destroyed
?
It
behoves
me
to
be
*NL*
calm
and
patient
,
to
learn
the
way
of
the
people
,
to
get
a
clear
*NL*
idea
of
the
method
of
my
loss
,
and
the
means
of
getting
materials
*NL*
and
tools
;
so
that
in
the
end
,
perhaps
,
I
may
make
another
.
''
That
*NL*
would
be
my
only
hope
,
perhaps
,
but
better
than
despair
.
And
,
after
*NL*
all
,
it
was
a
beautiful
and
curious
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
probably
,
the
machine
had
only
been
taken
away
.
Still
,
I
must
*NL*
be
calm
and
patient
,
find
its
hiding-place
,
and
recover
it
by
force
*NL*
or
cunning
.
And
with
that
I
scrambled
to
my
feet
and
looked
about
*NL*
me
,
wondering
where
I
could
bathe
.
I
felt
weary
,
stiff
,
and
*NL*
travel-soiled
.
The
freshness
of
the
morning
made
me
desire
an
equal
*NL*
freshness
.
I
had
exhausted
my
emotion
.
Indeed
,
as
I
went
about
*NL*
my
business
,
I
found
myself
wondering
at
my
intense
excitement
*NL*
overnight
.
I
made
a
careful
examination
of
the
ground
about
the
*NL*
little
lawn
.
I
wasted
some
time
in
futile
questionings
,
conveyed
,
as
*NL*
well
as
I
was
able
,
to
such
of
the
little
people
as
came
by
.
They
*NL*
all
failed
to
understand
my
gestures
;
some
were
simply
stolid
,
some
*NL*
thought
it
was
a
jest
and
laughed
at
me
.
I
had
the
hardest
task
in
*NL*
the
world
to
keep
my
hands
off
their
pretty
laughing
faces
.
It
was
*NL*
a
foolish
impulse
,
but
the
devil
begotten
of
fear
and
blind
anger
*NL*
was
ill
curbed
and
still
eager
to
take
advantage
of
my
perplexity
.
*NL*
The
turf
gave
better
counsel
.
I
found
a
groove
ripped
in
it
,
about
*NL*
midway
between
the
pedestal
of
the
sphinx
and
the
marks
of
my
feet
*NL*
where
,
on
arrival
,
I
had
struggled
with
the
overturned
machine
.
*NL*
There
were
other
signs
of
removal
about
,
with
queer
narrow
*NL*
footprints
like
those
I
could
imagine
made
by
a
sloth
.
This
directed
*NL*
my
closer
attention
to
the
pedestal
.
It
was
,
as
I
think
I
have
said
,
*NL*
of
bronze
.
It
was
not
a
mere
block
,
but
highly
decorated
with
deep
*NL*
framed
panels
on
either
side
.
I
went
and
rapped
at
these
.
The
*NL*
pedestal
was
hollow
.
Examining
the
panels
with
care
I
found
them
*NL*
discontinuous
with
the
frames
.
There
were
no
handles
or
keyholes
,
*NL*
but
possibly
the
panels
,
if
they
were
doors
,
as
I
supposed
,
opened
*NL*
from
within
.
One
thing
was
clear
enough
to
my
mind
.
It
took
no
very
*NL*
great
mental
effort
to
infer
that
my
Time
Machine
was
inside
that
*NL*
pedestal
.
But
how
it
got
there
was
a
different
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
saw
the
heads
of
two
orange-clad
people
coming
through
the
bushes
*NL*
and
under
some
blossom-covered
apple-trees
towards
me
.
I
turned
*NL*
smiling
to
them
and
beckoned
them
to
me
.
They
came
,
and
then
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
bronze
pedestal
,
I
tried
to
intimate
my
wish
to
open
*NL*
it
.
But
at
my
first
gesture
towards
this
they
behaved
very
oddly
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
how
to
convey
their
expression
to
you
.
Suppose
you
were
*NL*
to
use
a
grossly
improper
gesture
to
a
delicate-minded
woman
--
it
is
*NL*
how
she
would
look
.
They
went
off
as
if
they
had
received
the
last
*NL*
possible
insult
.
I
tried
a
sweet-looking
little
chap
in
white
next
,
*NL*
with
exactly
the
same
result
.
Somehow
,
his
manner
made
me
feel
*NL*
ashamed
of
myself
.
But
,
as
you
know
,
I
wanted
the
Time
Machine
,
and
*NL*
I
tried
him
once
more
.
As
he
turned
off
,
like
the
others
,
my
temper
*NL*
got
the
better
of
me
.
In
three
strides
I
was
after
him
,
had
him
by
*NL*
the
loose
part
of
his
robe
round
the
neck
,
and
began
dragging
him
*NL*
towards
the
sphinx
.
Then
I
saw
the
horror
and
repugnance
of
his
*NL*
face
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
let
him
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
I
was
not
beaten
yet
.
I
banged
with
my
fist
at
the
bronze
*NL*
panels
.
I
thought
I
heard
something
stir
inside
--
to
be
explicit
,
*NL*
I
thought
I
heard
a
sound
like
a
chuckle
--
but
I
must
have
been
*NL*
mistaken
.
Then
I
got
a
big
pebble
from
the
river
,
and
came
and
*NL*
hammered
till
I
had
flattened
a
coil
in
the
decorations
,
and
the
*NL*
verdigris
came
off
in
powdery
flakes
.
The
delicate
little
people
*NL*
must
have
heard
me
hammering
in
gusty
outbreaks
a
mile
away
on
*NL*
either
hand
,
but
nothing
came
of
it
.
I
saw
a
crowd
of
them
upon
the
*NL*
slopes
,
looking
furtively
at
me
.
At
last
,
hot
and
tired
,
I
sat
down
*NL*
to
watch
the
place
.
But
I
was
too
restless
to
watch
long
;
I
am
too
*NL*
Occidental
for
a
long
vigil
.
I
could
work
at
a
problem
for
years
,
*NL*
but
to
wait
inactive
for
twenty-four
hours
--
that
is
another
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
got
up
after
a
time
,
and
began
walking
aimlessly
through
the
*NL*
bushes
towards
the
hill
again
.
``
Patience
,
''
said
I
to
myself
.
``
If
you
*NL*
want
your
machine
again
you
must
leave
that
sphinx
alone
.
If
they
*NL*
mean
to
take
your
machine
away
,
it
's
little
good
your
wrecking
their
*NL*
bronze
panels
,
and
if
they
do
n't
,
you
will
get
it
back
as
soon
as
*NL*
you
can
ask
for
it
.
To
sit
among
all
those
unknown
things
before
a
*NL*
puzzle
like
that
is
hopeless
.
That
way
lies
monomania
.
Face
this
*NL*
world
.
Learn
its
ways
,
watch
it
,
be
careful
of
too
hasty
guesses
*NL*
at
its
meaning
.
In
the
end
you
will
find
clues
to
it
all
.
''
Then
*NL*
suddenly
the
humour
of
the
situation
came
into
my
mind
:
the
thought
*NL*
of
the
years
I
had
spent
in
study
and
toil
to
get
into
the
future
*NL*
age
,
and
now
my
passion
of
anxiety
to
get
out
of
it
.
I
had
made
*NL*
myself
the
most
complicated
and
the
most
hopeless
trap
that
ever
a
*NL*
man
devised
.
Although
it
was
at
my
own
expense
,
I
could
not
help
*NL*
myself
.
I
laughed
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Going
through
the
big
palace
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
little
*NL*
people
avoided
me
.
It
may
have
been
my
fancy
,
or
it
may
have
had
*NL*
something
to
do
with
my
hammering
at
the
gates
of
bronze
.
Yet
I
felt
*NL*
tolerably
sure
of
the
avoidance
.
I
was
careful
,
however
,
to
show
no
*NL*
concern
and
to
abstain
from
any
pursuit
of
them
,
and
in
the
course
*NL*
of
a
day
or
two
things
got
back
to
the
old
footing
.
I
made
what
*NL*
progress
I
could
in
the
language
,
and
in
addition
I
pushed
my
*NL*
explorations
here
and
there
.
Either
I
missed
some
subtle
point
or
*NL*
their
language
was
excessively
simple
--
almost
exclusively
composed
*NL*
of
concrete
substantives
and
verbs
.
There
seemed
to
be
few
,
if
any
,
*NL*
abstract
terms
,
or
little
use
of
figurative
language
.
Their
*NL*
sentences
were
usually
simple
and
of
two
words
,
and
I
failed
to
*NL*
convey
or
understand
any
but
the
simplest
propositions
.
I
determined
*NL*
to
put
the
thought
of
my
Time
Machine
and
the
mystery
of
the
bronze
*NL*
doors
under
the
sphinx
as
much
as
possible
in
a
corner
of
memory
,
*NL*
until
my
growing
knowledge
would
lead
me
back
to
them
in
a
natural
*NL*
way
.
Yet
a
certain
feeling
,
you
may
understand
,
tethered
me
in
a
*NL*
circle
of
a
few
miles
round
the
point
of
my
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
far
as
I
could
see
,
all
the
world
displayed
the
same
exuberant
*NL*
richness
as
the
Thames
valley
.
From
every
hill
I
climbed
I
saw
the
*NL*
same
abundance
of
splendid
buildings
,
endlessly
varied
in
material
*NL*
and
style
,
the
same
clustering
thickets
of
evergreens
,
the
same
*NL*
blossom-laden
trees
and
tree-ferns
.
Here
and
there
water
shone
like
*NL*
silver
,
and
beyond
,
the
land
rose
into
blue
undulating
hills
,
and
*NL*
so
faded
into
the
serenity
of
the
sky
.
A
peculiar
feature
,
which
*NL*
presently
attracted
my
attention
,
was
the
presence
of
certain
*NL*
circular
wells
,
several
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
of
a
very
great
depth
.
*NL*
One
lay
by
the
path
up
the
hill
,
which
I
had
followed
during
my
*NL*
first
walk
.
Like
the
others
,
it
was
rimmed
with
bronze
,
curiously
*NL*
wrought
,
and
protected
by
a
little
cupola
from
the
rain
.
Sitting
by
*NL*
the
side
of
these
wells
,
and
peering
down
into
the
shafted
darkness
,
*NL*
I
could
see
no
gleam
of
water
,
nor
could
I
start
any
reflection
*NL*
with
a
lighted
match
.
But
in
all
of
them
I
heard
a
certain
sound
:
*NL*
a
thud
--
thud
--
thud
,
like
the
beating
of
some
big
engine
;
and
I
*NL*
discovered
,
from
the
flaring
of
my
matches
,
that
a
steady
current
of
*NL*
air
set
down
the
shafts
.
Further
,
I
threw
a
scrap
of
paper
into
the
*NL*
throat
of
one
,
and
,
instead
of
fluttering
slowly
down
,
it
was
at
*NL*
once
sucked
swiftly
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
a
time
,
too
,
I
came
to
connect
these
wells
with
tall
towers
*NL*
standing
here
and
there
upon
the
slopes
;
for
above
them
there
was
*NL*
often
just
such
a
flicker
in
the
air
as
one
sees
on
a
hot
day
above
*NL*
a
sun-scorched
beach
.
Putting
things
together
,
I
reached
a
strong
*NL*
suggestion
of
an
extensive
system
of
subterranean
ventilation
,
whose
*NL*
true
import
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
.
I
was
at
first
inclined
to
*NL*
associate
it
with
the
sanitary
apparatus
of
these
people
.
It
was
an
*NL*
obvious
conclusion
,
but
it
was
absolutely
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
here
I
must
admit
that
I
learned
very
little
of
drains
and
*NL*
bells
and
modes
of
conveyance
,
and
the
like
conveniences
,
during
my
*NL*
time
in
this
real
future
.
In
some
of
these
visions
of
Utopias
and
*NL*
coming
times
which
I
have
read
,
there
is
a
vast
amount
of
detail
*NL*
about
building
,
and
social
arrangements
,
and
so
forth
.
But
while
*NL*
such
details
are
easy
enough
to
obtain
when
the
whole
world
is
*NL*
contained
in
one
's
imagination
,
they
are
altogether
inaccessible
to
*NL*
a
real
traveller
amid
such
realities
as
I
found
here
.
Conceive
the
*NL*
tale
of
London
which
a
negro
,
fresh
from
Central
Africa
,
would
take
*NL*
back
to
his
tribe
!
What
would
he
know
of
railway
companies
,
of
*NL*
social
movements
,
of
telephone
and
telegraph
wires
,
of
the
Parcels
*NL*
Delivery
Company
,
and
postal
orders
and
the
like
?
Yet
we
,
at
least
,
*NL*
should
be
willing
enough
to
explain
these
things
to
him
!
And
even
of
*NL*
what
he
knew
,
how
much
could
he
make
his
untravelled
friend
either
*NL*
apprehend
or
believe
?
Then
,
think
how
narrow
the
gap
between
a
negro
*NL*
and
a
white
man
of
our
own
times
,
and
how
wide
the
interval
between
*NL*
myself
and
these
of
the
Golden
Age
!
I
was
sensible
of
much
which
was
*NL*
unseen
,
and
which
contributed
to
my
comfort
;
but
save
for
a
general
*NL*
impression
of
automatic
organization
,
I
fear
I
can
convey
very
*NL*
little
of
the
difference
to
your
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
the
matter
of
sepulture
,
for
instance
,
I
could
see
no
signs
of
*NL*
crematoria
nor
anything
suggestive
of
tombs
.
But
it
occurred
to
me
*NL*
that
,
possibly
,
there
might
be
cemeteries
-LRB-
or
crematoria
-RRB-
somewhere
*NL*
beyond
the
range
of
my
explorings
.
This
,
again
,
was
a
question
I
*NL*
deliberately
put
to
myself
,
and
my
curiosity
was
at
first
entirely
*NL*
defeated
upon
the
point
.
The
thing
puzzled
me
,
and
I
was
led
to
make
*NL*
a
further
remark
,
which
puzzled
me
still
more
:
that
aged
and
infirm
*NL*
among
this
people
there
were
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
must
confess
that
my
satisfaction
with
my
first
theories
of
an
*NL*
automatic
civilization
and
a
decadent
humanity
did
not
long
endure
.
*NL*
Yet
I
could
think
of
no
other
.
Let
me
put
my
difficulties
.
The
*NL*
several
big
palaces
I
had
explored
were
mere
living
places
,
great
*NL*
dining-halls
and
sleeping
apartments
.
I
could
find
no
machinery
,
no
*NL*
appliances
of
any
kind
.
Yet
these
people
were
clothed
in
pleasant
*NL*
fabrics
that
must
at
times
need
renewal
,
and
their
sandals
,
though
*NL*
undecorated
,
were
fairly
complex
specimens
of
metalwork
.
Somehow
*NL*
such
things
must
be
made
.
And
the
little
people
displayed
no
vestige
*NL*
of
a
creative
tendency
.
There
were
no
shops
,
no
workshops
,
no
sign
*NL*
of
importations
among
them
.
They
spent
all
their
time
in
playing
*NL*
gently
,
in
bathing
in
the
river
,
in
making
love
in
a
half-playful
*NL*
fashion
,
in
eating
fruit
and
sleeping
.
I
could
not
see
how
things
*NL*
were
kept
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
again
,
about
the
Time
Machine
:
something
,
I
knew
not
what
,
*NL*
had
taken
it
into
the
hollow
pedestal
of
the
White
Sphinx
.
Why
?
For
*NL*
the
life
of
me
I
could
not
imagine
.
Those
waterless
wells
,
too
,
*NL*
those
flickering
pillars
.
I
felt
I
lacked
a
clue
.
I
felt
--
how
shall
*NL*
I
put
it
?
Suppose
you
found
an
inscription
,
with
sentences
here
and
*NL*
there
in
excellent
plain
English
,
and
interpolated
therewith
,
others
*NL*
made
up
of
words
,
of
letters
even
,
absolutely
unknown
to
you
?
Well
,
*NL*
on
the
third
day
of
my
visit
,
that
was
how
the
world
of
Eight
*NL*
Hundred
and
Two
Thousand
Seven
Hundred
and
One
presented
itself
to
*NL*
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
day
,
too
,
I
made
a
friend
--
of
a
sort
.
It
happened
that
,
as
I
*NL*
was
watching
some
of
the
little
people
bathing
in
a
shallow
,
one
of
*NL*
them
was
seized
with
cramp
and
began
drifting
downstream
.
The
main
*NL*
current
ran
rather
swiftly
,
but
not
too
strongly
for
even
a
moderate
*NL*
swimmer
.
It
will
give
you
an
idea
,
therefore
,
of
the
strange
*NL*
deficiency
in
these
creatures
,
when
I
tell
you
that
none
made
the
*NL*
slightest
attempt
to
rescue
the
weakly
crying
little
thing
which
*NL*
was
drowning
before
their
eyes
.
When
I
realized
this
,
I
hurriedly
*NL*
slipped
off
my
clothes
,
and
,
wading
in
at
a
point
lower
down
,
I
*NL*
caught
the
poor
mite
and
drew
her
safe
to
land
.
A
little
rubbing
of
*NL*
the
limbs
soon
brought
her
round
,
and
I
had
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
seeing
she
was
all
right
before
I
left
her
.
I
had
got
to
such
a
low
*NL*
estimate
of
her
kind
that
I
did
not
expect
any
gratitude
from
her
.
*NL*
In
that
,
however
,
I
was
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
happened
in
the
morning
.
In
the
afternoon
I
met
my
little
*NL*
woman
,
as
I
believe
it
was
,
as
I
was
returning
towards
my
centre
*NL*
from
an
exploration
,
and
she
received
me
with
cries
of
delight
and
*NL*
presented
me
with
a
big
garland
of
flowers
--
evidently
made
for
me
*NL*
and
me
alone
.
The
thing
took
my
imagination
.
Very
possibly
I
had
*NL*
been
feeling
desolate
.
At
any
rate
I
did
my
best
to
display
my
*NL*
appreciation
of
the
gift
.
We
were
soon
seated
together
in
a
little
*NL*
stone
arbour
,
engaged
in
conversation
,
chiefly
of
smiles
.
The
*NL*
creature
's
friendliness
affected
me
exactly
as
a
child
's
might
have
*NL*
done
.
We
passed
each
other
flowers
,
and
she
kissed
my
hands
.
I
did
*NL*
the
same
to
hers
.
Then
I
tried
talk
,
and
found
that
her
name
was
*NL*
Weena
,
which
,
though
I
do
n't
know
what
it
meant
,
somehow
seemed
*NL*
appropriate
enough
.
That
was
the
beginning
of
a
queer
friendship
*NL*
which
lasted
a
week
,
and
ended
--
as
I
will
tell
you
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
was
exactly
like
a
child
.
She
wanted
to
be
with
me
always
.
She
*NL*
tried
to
follow
me
everywhere
,
and
on
my
next
journey
out
and
about
*NL*
it
went
to
my
heart
to
tire
her
down
,
and
leave
her
at
last
,
*NL*
exhausted
and
calling
after
me
rather
plaintively
.
But
the
problems
*NL*
of
the
world
had
to
be
mastered
.
I
had
not
,
I
said
to
myself
,
come
*NL*
into
the
future
to
carry
on
a
miniature
flirtation
.
Yet
her
distress
*NL*
when
I
left
her
was
very
great
,
her
expostulations
at
the
parting
*NL*
were
sometimes
frantic
,
and
I
think
,
altogether
,
I
had
as
much
*NL*
trouble
as
comfort
from
her
devotion
.
Nevertheless
she
was
,
somehow
,
*NL*
a
very
great
comfort
.
I
thought
it
was
mere
childish
affection
that
*NL*
made
her
cling
to
me
.
Until
it
was
too
late
,
I
did
not
clearly
know
*NL*
what
I
had
inflicted
upon
her
when
I
left
her
.
Nor
until
it
was
too
*NL*
late
did
I
clearly
understand
what
she
was
to
me
.
For
,
by
merely
*NL*
seeming
fond
of
me
,
and
showing
in
her
weak
,
futile
way
that
she
*NL*
cared
for
me
,
the
little
doll
of
a
creature
presently
gave
my
return
*NL*
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
White
Sphinx
almost
the
feeling
of
*NL*
coming
home
;
and
I
would
watch
for
her
tiny
figure
of
white
and
gold
*NL*
so
soon
as
I
came
over
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
from
her
,
too
,
that
I
learned
that
fear
had
not
yet
left
the
*NL*
world
.
She
was
fearless
enough
in
the
daylight
,
and
she
had
the
*NL*
oddest
confidence
in
me
;
for
once
,
in
a
foolish
moment
,
I
made
*NL*
threatening
grimaces
at
her
,
and
she
simply
laughed
at
them
.
But
she
*NL*
dreaded
the
dark
,
dreaded
shadows
,
dreaded
black
things
.
Darkness
*NL*
to
her
was
the
one
thing
dreadful
.
It
was
a
singularly
passionate
*NL*
emotion
,
and
it
set
me
thinking
and
observing
.
I
discovered
then
,
*NL*
among
other
things
,
that
these
little
people
gathered
into
the
great
*NL*
houses
after
dark
,
and
slept
in
droves
.
To
enter
upon
them
without
a
*NL*
light
was
to
put
them
into
a
tumult
of
apprehension
.
I
never
found
*NL*
one
out
of
doors
,
or
one
sleeping
alone
within
doors
,
after
dark
.
*NL*
Yet
I
was
still
such
a
blockhead
that
I
missed
the
lesson
of
that
*NL*
fear
,
and
in
spite
of
Weena
's
distress
I
insisted
upon
sleeping
away
*NL*
from
these
slumbering
multitudes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
troubled
her
greatly
,
but
in
the
end
her
odd
affection
for
me
*NL*
triumphed
,
and
for
five
of
the
nights
of
our
acquaintance
,
including
*NL*
the
last
night
of
all
,
she
slept
with
her
head
pillowed
on
my
arm
.
*NL*
But
my
story
slips
away
from
me
as
I
speak
of
her
.
It
must
have
been
*NL*
the
night
before
her
rescue
that
I
was
awakened
about
dawn
.
I
had
*NL*
been
restless
,
dreaming
most
disagreeably
that
I
was
drowned
,
and
*NL*
that
sea
anemones
were
feeling
over
my
face
with
their
soft
palps
.
*NL*
I
woke
with
a
start
,
and
with
an
odd
fancy
that
some
greyish
animal
*NL*
had
just
rushed
out
of
the
chamber
.
I
tried
to
get
to
sleep
again
,
*NL*
but
I
felt
restless
and
uncomfortable
.
It
was
that
dim
grey
hour
*NL*
when
things
are
just
creeping
out
of
darkness
,
when
everything
is
*NL*
colourless
and
clear
cut
,
and
yet
unreal
.
I
got
up
,
and
went
down
*NL*
into
the
great
hall
,
and
so
out
upon
the
flagstones
in
front
of
the
*NL*
palace
.
I
thought
I
would
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
,
and
see
the
*NL*
sunrise
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
moon
was
setting
,
and
the
dying
moonlight
and
the
first
pallor
*NL*
of
dawn
were
mingled
in
a
ghastly
half-light
.
The
bushes
were
inky
*NL*
black
,
the
ground
a
sombre
grey
,
the
sky
colourless
and
cheerless
.
*NL*
And
up
the
hill
I
thought
I
could
see
ghosts
.
There
several
times
,
*NL*
as
I
scanned
the
slope
,
I
saw
white
figures
.
Twice
I
fancied
I
saw
*NL*
a
solitary
white
,
ape-like
creature
running
rather
quickly
up
the
*NL*
hill
,
and
once
near
the
ruins
I
saw
a
leash
of
them
carrying
some
*NL*
dark
body
.
They
moved
hastily
.
I
did
not
see
what
became
of
them
.
*NL*
It
seemed
that
they
vanished
among
the
bushes
.
The
dawn
was
still
*NL*
indistinct
,
you
must
understand
.
I
was
feeling
that
chill
,
*NL*
uncertain
,
early-morning
feeling
you
may
have
known
.
I
doubted
*NL*
my
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
the
eastern
sky
grew
brighter
,
and
the
light
of
the
day
came
on
*NL*
and
its
vivid
colouring
returned
upon
the
world
once
more
,
I
scanned
*NL*
the
view
keenly
.
But
I
saw
no
vestige
of
my
white
figures
.
They
were
*NL*
mere
creatures
of
the
half
light
.
``
They
must
have
been
ghosts
,
''
I
*NL*
said
;
``
I
wonder
whence
they
dated
.
''
For
a
queer
notion
of
Grant
*NL*
Allen
's
came
into
my
head
,
and
amused
me
.
If
each
generation
die
and
*NL*
leave
ghosts
,
he
argued
,
the
world
at
last
will
get
overcrowded
with
*NL*
them
.
On
that
theory
they
would
have
grown
innumerable
some
Eight
*NL*
Hundred
Thousand
Years
hence
,
and
it
was
no
great
wonder
to
see
four
*NL*
at
once
.
But
the
jest
was
unsatisfying
,
and
I
was
thinking
of
these
*NL*
figures
all
the
morning
,
until
Weena
's
rescue
drove
them
out
of
my
*NL*
head
.
I
associated
them
in
some
indefinite
way
with
the
white
animal
*NL*
I
had
startled
in
my
first
passionate
search
for
the
Time
Machine
.
*NL*
But
Weena
was
a
pleasant
substitute
.
Yet
all
the
same
,
they
were
*NL*
soon
destined
to
take
far
deadlier
possession
of
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
I
have
said
how
much
hotter
than
our
own
was
the
weather
*NL*
of
this
Golden
Age
.
I
can
not
account
for
it
.
It
may
be
that
the
sun
*NL*
was
hotter
,
or
the
earth
nearer
the
sun
.
It
is
usual
to
assume
that
*NL*
the
sun
will
go
on
cooling
steadily
in
the
future
.
But
people
,
*NL*
unfamiliar
with
such
speculations
as
those
of
the
younger
Darwin
,
*NL*
forget
that
the
planets
must
ultimately
fall
back
one
by
one
into
*NL*
the
parent
body
.
As
these
catastrophes
occur
,
the
sun
will
blaze
*NL*
with
renewed
energy
;
and
it
may
be
that
some
inner
planet
had
*NL*
suffered
this
fate
.
Whatever
the
reason
,
the
fact
remains
that
the
*NL*
sun
was
very
much
hotter
than
we
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
one
very
hot
morning
--
my
fourth
,
I
think
--
as
I
was
seeking
*NL*
shelter
from
the
heat
and
glare
in
a
colossal
ruin
near
the
great
*NL*
house
where
I
slept
and
fed
,
there
happened
this
strange
thing
:
*NL*
Clambering
among
these
heaps
of
masonry
,
I
found
a
narrow
gallery
,
*NL*
whose
end
and
side
windows
were
blocked
by
fallen
masses
of
stone
.
*NL*
By
contrast
with
the
brilliancy
outside
,
it
seemed
at
first
*NL*
impenetrably
dark
to
me
.
I
entered
it
groping
,
for
the
change
from
*NL*
light
to
blackness
made
spots
of
colour
swim
before
me
.
Suddenly
I
*NL*
halted
spellbound
.
A
pair
of
eyes
,
luminous
by
reflection
against
*NL*
the
daylight
without
,
was
watching
me
out
of
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
old
instinctive
dread
of
wild
beasts
came
upon
me
.
I
clenched
*NL*
my
hands
and
steadfastly
looked
into
the
glaring
eyeballs
.
I
was
*NL*
afraid
to
turn
.
Then
the
thought
of
the
absolute
security
in
which
*NL*
humanity
appeared
to
be
living
came
to
my
mind
.
And
then
I
*NL*
remembered
that
strange
terror
of
the
dark
.
Overcoming
my
fear
to
*NL*
some
extent
,
I
advanced
a
step
and
spoke
.
I
will
admit
that
my
*NL*
voice
was
harsh
and
ill-controlled
.
I
put
out
my
hand
and
touched
*NL*
something
soft
.
At
once
the
eyes
darted
sideways
,
and
something
*NL*
white
ran
past
me
.
I
turned
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
,
and
saw
a
*NL*
queer
little
ape-like
figure
,
its
head
held
down
in
a
peculiar
*NL*
manner
,
running
across
the
sunlit
space
behind
me
.
It
blundered
*NL*
against
a
block
of
granite
,
staggered
aside
,
and
in
a
moment
was
*NL*
hidden
in
a
black
shadow
beneath
another
pile
of
ruined
masonry
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
impression
of
it
is
,
of
course
,
imperfect
;
but
I
know
it
was
a
*NL*
dull
white
,
and
had
strange
large
greyish-red
eyes
;
also
that
there
*NL*
was
flaxen
hair
on
its
head
and
down
its
back
.
But
,
as
I
say
,
it
*NL*
went
too
fast
for
me
to
see
distinctly
.
I
can
not
even
say
whether
it
*NL*
ran
on
all-fours
,
or
only
with
its
forearms
held
very
low
.
After
an
*NL*
instant
's
pause
I
followed
it
into
the
second
heap
of
ruins
.
I
could
*NL*
not
find
it
at
first
;
but
,
after
a
time
in
the
profound
obscurity
,
I
*NL*
came
upon
one
of
those
round
well-like
openings
of
which
I
have
told
*NL*
you
,
half
closed
by
a
fallen
pillar
.
A
sudden
thought
came
to
me
.
*NL*
Could
this
Thing
have
vanished
down
the
shaft
?
I
lit
a
match
,
and
,
*NL*
looking
down
,
I
saw
a
small
,
white
,
moving
creature
,
with
large
*NL*
bright
eyes
which
regarded
me
steadfastly
as
it
retreated
.
It
made
*NL*
me
shudder
.
It
was
so
like
a
human
spider
!
It
was
clambering
down
*NL*
the
wall
,
and
now
I
saw
for
the
first
time
a
number
of
metal
foot
*NL*
and
hand
rests
forming
a
kind
of
ladder
down
the
shaft
.
Then
the
*NL*
light
burned
my
fingers
and
fell
out
of
my
hand
,
going
out
as
it
*NL*
dropped
,
and
when
I
had
lit
another
the
little
monster
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
not
know
how
long
I
sat
peering
down
that
well
.
It
was
not
for
*NL*
some
time
that
I
could
succeed
in
persuading
myself
that
the
thing
I
*NL*
had
seen
was
human
.
But
,
gradually
,
the
truth
dawned
on
me
:
that
*NL*
Man
had
not
remained
one
species
,
but
had
differentiated
into
two
*NL*
distinct
animals
:
that
my
graceful
children
of
the
Upper-world
were
*NL*
not
the
sole
descendants
of
our
generation
,
but
that
this
bleached
,
*NL*
obscene
,
nocturnal
Thing
,
which
had
flashed
before
me
,
was
also
heir
*NL*
to
all
the
ages
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
of
the
flickering
pillars
and
of
my
theory
of
an
*NL*
underground
ventilation
.
I
began
to
suspect
their
true
import
.
And
*NL*
what
,
I
wondered
,
was
this
Lemur
doing
in
my
scheme
of
a
perfectly
*NL*
balanced
organization
?
How
was
it
related
to
the
indolent
serenity
*NL*
of
the
beautiful
Upper-worlders
?
And
what
was
hidden
down
there
,
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
that
shaft
?
I
sat
upon
the
edge
of
the
well
telling
*NL*
myself
that
,
at
any
rate
,
there
was
nothing
to
fear
,
and
that
there
*NL*
I
must
descend
for
the
solution
of
my
difficulties
.
And
withal
I
*NL*
was
absolutely
afraid
to
go
!
As
I
hesitated
,
two
of
the
beautiful
*NL*
Upper-world
people
came
running
in
their
amorous
sport
across
the
*NL*
daylight
in
the
shadow
.
The
male
pursued
the
female
,
flinging
*NL*
flowers
at
her
as
he
ran
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
seemed
distressed
to
find
me
,
my
arm
against
the
overturned
*NL*
pillar
,
peering
down
the
well
.
Apparently
it
was
considered
bad
form
*NL*
to
remark
these
apertures
;
for
when
I
pointed
to
this
one
,
and
tried
*NL*
to
frame
a
question
about
it
in
their
tongue
,
they
were
still
more
*NL*
visibly
distressed
and
turned
away
.
But
they
were
interested
by
my
*NL*
matches
,
and
I
struck
some
to
amuse
them
.
I
tried
them
again
about
*NL*
the
well
,
and
again
I
failed
.
So
presently
I
left
them
,
meaning
to
*NL*
go
back
to
Weena
,
and
see
what
I
could
get
from
her
.
But
my
mind
was
*NL*
already
in
revolution
;
my
guesses
and
impressions
were
slipping
and
*NL*
sliding
to
a
new
adjustment
.
I
had
now
a
clue
to
the
import
of
these
*NL*
wells
,
to
the
ventilating
towers
,
to
the
mystery
of
the
ghosts
;
to
*NL*
say
nothing
of
a
hint
at
the
meaning
of
the
bronze
gates
and
the
*NL*
fate
of
the
Time
Machine
!
And
very
vaguely
there
came
a
suggestion
*NL*
towards
the
solution
of
the
economic
problem
that
had
puzzled
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
was
the
new
view
.
Plainly
,
this
second
species
of
Man
was
*NL*
subterranean
.
There
were
three
circumstances
in
particular
which
*NL*
made
me
think
that
its
rare
emergence
above
ground
was
the
outcome
*NL*
of
a
long-continued
underground
habit
.
In
the
first
place
,
there
was
*NL*
the
bleached
look
common
in
most
animals
that
live
largely
in
the
*NL*
dark
--
the
white
fish
of
the
Kentucky
caves
,
for
instance
.
Then
,
*NL*
those
large
eyes
,
with
that
capacity
for
reflecting
light
,
are
*NL*
common
features
of
nocturnal
things
--
witness
the
owl
and
the
cat
.
*NL*
And
last
of
all
,
that
evident
confusion
in
the
sunshine
,
that
hasty
*NL*
yet
fumbling
awkward
flight
towards
dark
shadow
,
and
that
peculiar
*NL*
carriage
of
the
head
while
in
the
light
--
all
reinforced
the
theory
*NL*
of
an
extreme
sensitiveness
of
the
retina
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Beneath
my
feet
,
then
,
the
earth
must
be
tunnelled
enormously
,
and
*NL*
these
tunnellings
were
the
habitat
of
the
new
race
.
The
presence
of
*NL*
ventilating
shafts
and
wells
along
the
hill
slopes
--
everywhere
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
except
along
the
river
valley
--
showed
how
universal
were
its
*NL*
ramifications
.
What
so
natural
,
then
,
as
to
assume
that
it
was
in
*NL*
this
artificial
Underworld
that
such
work
as
was
necessary
to
the
*NL*
comfort
of
the
daylight
race
was
done
?
The
notion
was
so
plausible
*NL*
that
I
at
once
accepted
it
,
and
went
on
to
assume
the
_
how
_
of
this
*NL*
splitting
of
the
human
species
.
I
dare
say
you
will
anticipate
the
*NL*
shape
of
my
theory
;
though
,
for
myself
,
I
very
soon
felt
that
it
*NL*
fell
far
short
of
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
first
,
proceeding
from
the
problems
of
our
own
age
,
it
seemed
*NL*
clear
as
daylight
to
me
that
the
gradual
widening
of
the
present
*NL*
merely
temporary
and
social
difference
between
the
Capitalist
and
*NL*
the
Labourer
,
was
the
key
to
the
whole
position
.
No
doubt
it
will
*NL*
seem
grotesque
enough
to
you
--
and
wildly
incredible
!
--
and
yet
even
*NL*
now
there
are
existing
circumstances
to
point
that
way
.
There
is
*NL*
a
tendency
to
utilize
underground
space
for
the
less
ornamental
*NL*
purposes
of
civilization
;
there
is
the
Metropolitan
Railway
in
*NL*
London
,
for
instance
,
there
are
new
electric
railways
,
there
are
*NL*
subways
,
there
are
underground
workrooms
and
restaurants
,
and
they
*NL*
increase
and
multiply
.
Evidently
,
I
thought
,
this
tendency
had
*NL*
increased
till
Industry
had
gradually
lost
its
birthright
in
the
*NL*
sky
.
I
mean
that
it
had
gone
deeper
and
deeper
into
larger
and
ever
*NL*
larger
underground
factories
,
spending
a
still-increasing
amount
of
*NL*
its
time
therein
,
till
,
in
the
end
--
!
Even
now
,
does
not
an
East-end
*NL*
worker
live
in
such
artificial
conditions
as
practically
to
be
cut
*NL*
off
from
the
natural
surface
of
the
earth
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
Again
,
the
exclusive
tendency
of
richer
people
--
due
,
no
doubt
,
to
*NL*
the
increasing
refinement
of
their
education
,
and
the
widening
gulf
*NL*
between
them
and
the
rude
violence
of
the
poor
--
is
already
leading
*NL*
to
the
closing
,
in
their
interest
,
of
considerable
portions
of
the
*NL*
surface
of
the
land
.
About
London
,
for
instance
,
perhaps
half
the
*NL*
prettier
country
is
shut
in
against
intrusion
.
And
this
same
*NL*
widening
gulf
--
which
is
due
to
the
length
and
expense
of
the
higher
*NL*
educational
process
and
the
increased
facilities
for
and
temptations
*NL*
towards
refined
habits
on
the
part
of
the
rich
--
will
make
that
*NL*
exchange
between
class
and
class
,
that
promotion
by
intermarriage
*NL*
which
at
present
retards
the
splitting
of
our
species
along
lines
*NL*
of
social
stratification
,
less
and
less
frequent
.
So
,
in
the
end
,
*NL*
above
ground
you
must
have
the
Haves
,
pursuing
pleasure
and
comfort
*NL*
and
beauty
,
and
below
ground
the
Have-nots
,
the
Workers
getting
*NL*
continually
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
their
labour
.
Once
they
*NL*
were
there
,
they
would
no
doubt
have
to
pay
rent
,
and
not
a
little
*NL*
of
it
,
for
the
ventilation
of
their
caverns
;
and
if
they
refused
,
*NL*
they
would
starve
or
be
suffocated
for
arrears
.
Such
of
them
as
were
*NL*
so
constituted
as
to
be
miserable
and
rebellious
would
die
;
and
,
in
*NL*
the
end
,
the
balance
being
permanent
,
the
survivors
would
become
as
*NL*
well
adapted
to
the
conditions
of
underground
life
,
and
as
happy
in
*NL*
their
way
,
as
the
Upper-world
people
were
to
theirs
.
As
it
seemed
to
*NL*
me
,
the
refined
beauty
and
the
etiolated
pallor
followed
naturally
*NL*
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
great
triumph
of
Humanity
I
had
dreamed
of
took
a
different
*NL*
shape
in
my
mind
.
It
had
been
no
such
triumph
of
moral
education
and
*NL*
general
co-operation
as
I
had
imagined
.
Instead
,
I
saw
a
real
*NL*
aristocracy
,
armed
with
a
perfected
science
and
working
to
a
logical
*NL*
conclusion
the
industrial
system
of
to-day
.
Its
triumph
had
not
been
*NL*
simply
a
triumph
over
Nature
,
but
a
triumph
over
Nature
and
the
*NL*
fellow-man
.
This
,
I
must
warn
you
,
was
my
theory
at
the
time
.
I
had
*NL*
no
convenient
cicerone
in
the
pattern
of
the
Utopian
books
.
My
*NL*
explanation
may
be
absolutely
wrong
.
I
still
think
it
is
the
*NL*
most
plausible
one
.
But
even
on
this
supposition
the
balanced
*NL*
civilization
that
was
at
last
attained
must
have
long
since
passed
*NL*
its
zenith
,
and
was
now
far
fallen
into
decay
.
The
too-perfect
*NL*
security
of
the
Upper-worlders
had
led
them
to
a
slow
movement
of
*NL*
degeneration
,
to
a
general
dwindling
in
size
,
strength
,
and
*NL*
intelligence
.
That
I
could
see
clearly
enough
already
.
What
had
*NL*
happened
to
the
Under-grounders
I
did
not
yet
suspect
;
but
from
what
*NL*
I
had
seen
of
the
Morlocks
--
that
,
by
the
by
,
was
the
name
by
which
*NL*
these
creatures
were
called
--
I
could
imagine
that
the
modification
*NL*
of
the
human
type
was
even
far
more
profound
than
among
the
``
Eloi
,
''
*NL*
the
beautiful
race
that
I
already
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
came
troublesome
doubts
.
Why
had
the
Morlocks
taken
my
Time
*NL*
Machine
?
For
I
felt
sure
it
was
they
who
had
taken
it
.
Why
,
too
,
if
*NL*
the
Eloi
were
masters
,
could
they
not
restore
the
machine
to
me
?
And
*NL*
why
were
they
so
terribly
afraid
of
the
dark
?
I
proceeded
,
as
I
have
*NL*
said
,
to
question
Weena
about
this
Under-world
,
but
here
again
I
was
*NL*
disappointed
.
At
first
she
would
not
understand
my
questions
,
and
*NL*
presently
she
refused
to
answer
them
.
She
shivered
as
though
the
*NL*
topic
was
unendurable
.
And
when
I
pressed
her
,
perhaps
a
little
*NL*
harshly
,
she
burst
into
tears
.
They
were
the
only
tears
,
except
my
*NL*
own
,
I
ever
saw
in
that
Golden
Age
.
When
I
saw
them
I
ceased
*NL*
abruptly
to
trouble
about
the
Morlocks
,
and
was
only
concerned
in
*NL*
banishing
these
signs
of
the
human
inheritance
from
Weena
's
eyes
.
*NL*
And
very
soon
she
was
smiling
and
clapping
her
hands
,
while
I
*NL*
solemnly
burned
a
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
may
seem
odd
to
you
,
but
it
was
two
days
before
I
could
follow
*NL*
up
the
new-found
clue
in
what
was
manifestly
the
proper
way
.
I
felt
*NL*
a
peculiar
shrinking
from
those
pallid
bodies
.
They
were
just
the
*NL*
half-bleached
colour
of
the
worms
and
things
one
sees
preserved
in
*NL*
spirit
in
a
zoological
museum
.
And
they
were
filthily
cold
to
the
*NL*
touch
.
Probably
my
shrinking
was
largely
due
to
the
sympathetic
*NL*
influence
of
the
Eloi
,
whose
disgust
of
the
Morlocks
I
now
began
*NL*
to
appreciate
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
next
night
I
did
not
sleep
well
.
Probably
my
health
was
a
*NL*
little
disordered
.
I
was
oppressed
with
perplexity
and
doubt
.
Once
*NL*
or
twice
I
had
a
feeling
of
intense
fear
for
which
I
could
perceive
*NL*
no
definite
reason
.
I
remember
creeping
noiselessly
into
the
great
*NL*
hall
where
the
little
people
were
sleeping
in
the
moonlight
--
that
*NL*
night
Weena
was
among
them
--
and
feeling
reassured
by
their
presence
.
*NL*
It
occurred
to
me
even
then
,
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
the
*NL*
moon
must
pass
through
its
last
quarter
,
and
the
nights
grow
dark
,
*NL*
when
the
appearances
of
these
unpleasant
creatures
from
below
,
these
*NL*
whitened
Lemurs
,
this
new
vermin
that
had
replaced
the
old
,
might
be
*NL*
more
abundant
.
And
on
both
these
days
I
had
the
restless
feeling
of
*NL*
one
who
shirks
an
inevitable
duty
.
I
felt
assured
that
the
Time
*NL*
Machine
was
only
to
be
recovered
by
boldly
penetrating
these
*NL*
underground
mysteries
.
Yet
I
could
not
face
the
mystery
.
If
only
I
*NL*
had
had
a
companion
it
would
have
been
different
.
But
I
was
so
*NL*
horribly
alone
,
and
even
to
clamber
down
into
the
darkness
of
the
*NL*
well
appalled
me
.
I
do
n't
know
if
you
will
understand
my
feeling
,
*NL*
but
I
never
felt
quite
safe
at
my
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
this
restlessness
,
this
insecurity
,
perhaps
,
that
drove
me
*NL*
further
and
further
afield
in
my
exploring
expeditions
.
Going
to
the
*NL*
south-westward
towards
the
rising
country
that
is
now
called
Combe
*NL*
Wood
,
I
observed
far
off
,
in
the
direction
of
nineteenth-century
*NL*
Banstead
,
a
vast
green
structure
,
different
in
character
from
any
*NL*
I
had
hitherto
seen
.
It
was
larger
than
the
largest
of
the
palaces
*NL*
or
ruins
I
knew
,
and
the
facade
had
an
Oriental
look
:
the
face
*NL*
of
it
having
the
lustre
,
as
well
as
the
pale-green
tint
,
a
kind
*NL*
of
bluish-green
,
of
a
certain
type
of
Chinese
porcelain
.
This
*NL*
difference
in
aspect
suggested
a
difference
in
use
,
and
I
was
minded
*NL*
to
push
on
and
explore
.
But
the
day
was
growing
late
,
and
I
had
come
*NL*
upon
the
sight
of
the
place
after
a
long
and
tiring
circuit
;
so
I
*NL*
resolved
to
hold
over
the
adventure
for
the
following
day
,
and
I
*NL*
returned
to
the
welcome
and
the
caresses
of
little
Weena
.
But
next
*NL*
morning
I
perceived
clearly
enough
that
my
curiosity
regarding
the
*NL*
Palace
of
Green
Porcelain
was
a
piece
of
self-deception
,
to
enable
*NL*
me
to
shirk
,
by
another
day
,
an
experience
I
dreaded
.
I
resolved
I
*NL*
would
make
the
descent
without
further
waste
of
time
,
and
started
*NL*
out
in
the
early
morning
towards
a
well
near
the
ruins
of
granite
*NL*
and
aluminium
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Little
Weena
ran
with
me
.
She
danced
beside
me
to
the
well
,
but
*NL*
when
she
saw
me
lean
over
the
mouth
and
look
downward
,
she
seemed
*NL*
strangely
disconcerted
.
``
Good-bye
,
little
Weena
,
''
I
said
,
kissing
*NL*
her
;
and
then
putting
her
down
,
I
began
to
feel
over
the
parapet
*NL*
for
the
climbing
hooks
.
Rather
hastily
,
I
may
as
well
confess
,
for
*NL*
I
feared
my
courage
might
leak
away
!
At
first
she
watched
me
in
*NL*
amazement
.
Then
she
gave
a
most
piteous
cry
,
and
running
to
me
,
she
*NL*
began
to
pull
at
me
with
her
little
hands
.
I
think
her
opposition
*NL*
nerved
me
rather
to
proceed
.
I
shook
her
off
,
perhaps
a
little
*NL*
roughly
,
and
in
another
moment
I
was
in
the
throat
of
the
well
.
I
*NL*
saw
her
agonized
face
over
the
parapet
,
and
smiled
to
reassure
her
.
*NL*
Then
I
had
to
look
down
at
the
unstable
hooks
to
which
I
clung
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
had
to
clamber
down
a
shaft
of
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
.
The
*NL*
descent
was
effected
by
means
of
metallic
bars
projecting
from
*NL*
the
sides
of
the
well
,
and
these
being
adapted
to
the
needs
of
*NL*
a
creature
much
smaller
and
lighter
than
myself
,
I
was
speedily
*NL*
cramped
and
fatigued
by
the
descent
.
And
not
simply
fatigued
!
One
of
*NL*
the
bars
bent
suddenly
under
my
weight
,
and
almost
swung
me
off
into
*NL*
the
blackness
beneath
.
For
a
moment
I
hung
by
one
hand
,
and
after
*NL*
that
experience
I
did
not
dare
to
rest
again
.
Though
my
arms
and
*NL*
back
were
presently
acutely
painful
,
I
went
on
clambering
down
the
*NL*
sheer
descent
with
as
quick
a
motion
as
possible
.
Glancing
upward
,
*NL*
I
saw
the
aperture
,
a
small
blue
disk
,
in
which
a
star
was
visible
,
*NL*
while
little
Weena
's
head
showed
as
a
round
black
projection
.
The
*NL*
thudding
sound
of
a
machine
below
grew
louder
and
more
oppressive
.
*NL*
Everything
save
that
little
disk
above
was
profoundly
dark
,
and
when
*NL*
I
looked
up
again
Weena
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
in
an
agony
of
discomfort
.
I
had
some
thought
of
trying
to
go
*NL*
up
the
shaft
again
,
and
leave
the
Under-world
alone
.
But
even
while
*NL*
I
turned
this
over
in
my
mind
I
continued
to
descend
.
At
last
,
with
*NL*
intense
relief
,
I
saw
dimly
coming
up
,
a
foot
to
the
right
of
me
,
a
*NL*
slender
loophole
in
the
wall
.
Swinging
myself
in
,
I
found
it
was
the
*NL*
aperture
of
a
narrow
horizontal
tunnel
in
which
I
could
lie
down
and
*NL*
rest
.
It
was
not
too
soon
.
My
arms
ached
,
my
back
was
cramped
,
and
I
*NL*
was
trembling
with
the
prolonged
terror
of
a
fall
.
Besides
this
,
the
*NL*
unbroken
darkness
had
had
a
distressing
effect
upon
my
eyes
.
The
air
*NL*
was
full
of
the
throb
and
hum
of
machinery
pumping
air
down
the
*NL*
shaft
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
not
know
how
long
I
lay
.
I
was
roused
by
a
soft
hand
touching
*NL*
my
face
.
Starting
up
in
the
darkness
I
snatched
at
my
matches
and
,
*NL*
hastily
striking
one
,
I
saw
three
stooping
white
creatures
similar
*NL*
to
the
one
I
had
seen
above
ground
in
the
ruin
,
hastily
retreating
*NL*
before
the
light
.
Living
,
as
they
did
,
in
what
appeared
to
me
*NL*
impenetrable
darkness
,
their
eyes
were
abnormally
large
and
*NL*
sensitive
,
just
as
are
the
pupils
of
the
abysmal
fishes
,
and
they
*NL*
reflected
the
light
in
the
same
way
.
I
have
no
doubt
they
could
see
*NL*
me
in
that
rayless
obscurity
,
and
they
did
not
seem
to
have
any
fear
*NL*
of
me
apart
from
the
light
.
But
,
so
soon
as
I
struck
a
match
in
*NL*
order
to
see
them
,
they
fled
incontinently
,
vanishing
into
dark
*NL*
gutters
and
tunnels
,
from
which
their
eyes
glared
at
me
in
the
*NL*
strangest
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tried
to
call
to
them
,
but
the
language
they
had
was
apparently
*NL*
different
from
that
of
the
Over-world
people
;
so
that
I
was
needs
*NL*
left
to
my
own
unaided
efforts
,
and
the
thought
of
flight
before
*NL*
exploration
was
even
then
in
my
mind
.
But
I
said
to
myself
,
``
You
are
*NL*
in
for
it
now
,
''
and
,
feeling
my
way
along
the
tunnel
,
I
found
the
*NL*
noise
of
machinery
grow
louder
.
Presently
the
walls
fell
away
from
*NL*
me
,
and
I
came
to
a
large
open
space
,
and
striking
another
match
,
*NL*
saw
that
I
had
entered
a
vast
arched
cavern
,
which
stretched
into
*NL*
utter
darkness
beyond
the
range
of
my
light
.
The
view
I
had
of
it
*NL*
was
as
much
as
one
could
see
in
the
burning
of
a
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Necessarily
my
memory
is
vague
.
Great
shapes
like
big
machines
rose
*NL*
out
of
the
dimness
,
and
cast
grotesque
black
shadows
,
in
which
dim
*NL*
spectral
Morlocks
sheltered
from
the
glare
.
The
place
,
by
the
by
,
*NL*
was
very
stuffy
and
oppressive
,
and
the
faint
halitus
of
freshly
*NL*
shed
blood
was
in
the
air
.
Some
way
down
the
central
vista
was
a
*NL*
little
table
of
white
metal
,
laid
with
what
seemed
a
meal
.
The
*NL*
Morlocks
at
any
rate
were
carnivorous
!
Even
at
the
time
,
I
remember
*NL*
wondering
what
large
animal
could
have
survived
to
furnish
the
red
*NL*
joint
I
saw
.
It
was
all
very
indistinct
:
the
heavy
smell
,
the
big
*NL*
unmeaning
shapes
,
the
obscene
figures
lurking
in
the
shadows
,
and
*NL*
only
waiting
for
the
darkness
to
come
at
me
again
!
Then
the
match
*NL*
burned
down
,
and
stung
my
fingers
,
and
fell
,
a
wriggling
red
spot
*NL*
in
the
blackness
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
thought
since
how
particularly
ill-equipped
I
was
for
such
*NL*
an
experience
.
When
I
had
started
with
the
Time
Machine
,
I
had
*NL*
started
with
the
absurd
assumption
that
the
men
of
the
Future
would
*NL*
certainly
be
infinitely
ahead
of
ourselves
in
all
their
appliances
.
*NL*
I
had
come
without
arms
,
without
medicine
,
without
anything
to
*NL*
smoke
--
at
times
I
missed
tobacco
frightfully
--
even
without
enough
*NL*
matches
.
If
only
I
had
thought
of
a
Kodak
!
I
could
have
flashed
that
*NL*
glimpse
of
the
Underworld
in
a
second
,
and
examined
it
at
leisure
.
*NL*
But
,
as
it
was
,
I
stood
there
with
only
the
weapons
and
the
powers
*NL*
that
Nature
had
endowed
me
with
--
hands
,
feet
,
and
teeth
;
these
,
and
*NL*
four
safety-matches
that
still
remained
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
afraid
to
push
my
way
in
among
all
this
machinery
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
and
it
was
only
with
my
last
glimpse
of
light
I
discovered
*NL*
that
my
store
of
matches
had
run
low
.
It
had
never
occurred
to
me
*NL*
until
that
moment
that
there
was
any
need
to
economize
them
,
and
I
*NL*
had
wasted
almost
half
the
box
in
astonishing
the
Upper-worlders
,
to
*NL*
whom
fire
was
a
novelty
.
Now
,
as
I
say
,
I
had
four
left
,
and
while
I
*NL*
stood
in
the
dark
,
a
hand
touched
mine
,
lank
fingers
came
feeling
*NL*
over
my
face
,
and
I
was
sensible
of
a
peculiar
unpleasant
odour
.
I
*NL*
fancied
I
heard
the
breathing
of
a
crowd
of
those
dreadful
little
*NL*
beings
about
me
.
I
felt
the
box
of
matches
in
my
hand
being
gently
*NL*
disengaged
,
and
other
hands
behind
me
plucking
at
my
clothing
.
The
*NL*
sense
of
these
unseen
creatures
examining
me
was
indescribably
*NL*
unpleasant
.
The
sudden
realization
of
my
ignorance
of
their
ways
of
*NL*
thinking
and
doing
came
home
to
me
very
vividly
in
the
darkness
.
I
*NL*
shouted
at
them
as
loudly
as
I
could
.
They
started
away
,
and
then
*NL*
I
could
feel
them
approaching
me
again
.
They
clutched
at
me
more
*NL*
boldly
,
whispering
odd
sounds
to
each
other
.
I
shivered
violently
,
*NL*
and
shouted
again
--
rather
discordantly
.
This
time
they
were
not
so
*NL*
seriously
alarmed
,
and
they
made
a
queer
laughing
noise
as
they
came
*NL*
back
at
me
.
I
will
confess
I
was
horribly
frightened
.
I
determined
*NL*
to
strike
another
match
and
escape
under
the
protection
of
its
*NL*
glare
.
I
did
so
,
and
eking
out
the
flicker
with
a
scrap
of
paper
*NL*
from
my
pocket
,
I
made
good
my
retreat
to
the
narrow
tunnel
.
But
I
*NL*
had
scarce
entered
this
when
my
light
was
blown
out
and
in
the
*NL*
blackness
I
could
hear
the
Morlocks
rustling
like
wind
among
leaves
,
*NL*
and
pattering
like
the
rain
,
as
they
hurried
after
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
a
moment
I
was
clutched
by
several
hands
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
mistaking
that
they
were
trying
to
haul
me
back
.
I
struck
another
*NL*
light
,
and
waved
it
in
their
dazzled
faces
.
You
can
scarce
imagine
*NL*
how
nauseatingly
inhuman
they
looked
--
those
pale
,
chinless
faces
*NL*
and
great
,
lidless
,
pinkish-grey
eyes
!
--
as
they
stared
in
their
*NL*
blindness
and
bewilderment
.
But
I
did
not
stay
to
look
,
I
promise
*NL*
you
:
I
retreated
again
,
and
when
my
second
match
had
ended
,
I
struck
*NL*
my
third
.
It
had
almost
burned
through
when
I
reached
the
opening
*NL*
into
the
shaft
.
I
lay
down
on
the
edge
,
for
the
throb
of
the
great
*NL*
pump
below
made
me
giddy
.
Then
I
felt
sideways
for
the
projecting
*NL*
hooks
,
and
,
as
I
did
so
,
my
feet
were
grasped
from
behind
,
and
I
*NL*
was
violently
tugged
backward
.
I
lit
my
last
match
...
and
it
*NL*
incontinently
went
out
.
But
I
had
my
hand
on
the
climbing
bars
now
,
*NL*
and
,
kicking
violently
,
I
disengaged
myself
from
the
clutches
of
the
*NL*
Morlocks
and
was
speedily
clambering
up
the
shaft
,
while
they
stayed
*NL*
peering
and
blinking
up
at
me
:
all
but
one
little
wretch
who
*NL*
followed
me
for
some
way
,
and
well-nigh
secured
my
boot
as
a
trophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
climb
seemed
interminable
to
me
.
With
the
last
twenty
or
*NL*
thirty
feet
of
it
a
deadly
nausea
came
upon
me
.
I
had
the
greatest
*NL*
difficulty
in
keeping
my
hold
.
The
last
few
yards
was
a
frightful
*NL*
struggle
against
this
faintness
.
Several
times
my
head
swam
,
and
I
*NL*
felt
all
the
sensations
of
falling
.
At
last
,
however
,
I
got
over
the
*NL*
well-mouth
somehow
,
and
staggered
out
of
the
ruin
into
the
blinding
*NL*
sunlight
.
I
fell
upon
my
face
.
Even
the
soil
smelt
sweet
and
clean
.
*NL*
Then
I
remember
Weena
kissing
my
hands
and
ears
,
and
the
voices
of
*NL*
others
among
the
Eloi
.
Then
,
for
a
time
,
I
was
insensible
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
indeed
,
I
seemed
in
a
worse
case
than
before
.
Hitherto
,
*NL*
except
during
my
night
's
anguish
at
the
loss
of
the
Time
Machine
,
*NL*
I
had
felt
a
sustaining
hope
of
ultimate
escape
,
but
that
hope
was
*NL*
staggered
by
these
new
discoveries
.
Hitherto
I
had
merely
thought
*NL*
myself
impeded
by
the
childish
simplicity
of
the
little
people
,
and
*NL*
by
some
unknown
forces
which
I
had
only
to
understand
to
overcome
;
*NL*
but
there
was
an
altogether
new
element
in
the
sickening
quality
of
*NL*
the
Morlocks
--
a
something
inhuman
and
malign
.
Instinctively
I
*NL*
loathed
them
.
Before
,
I
had
felt
as
a
man
might
feel
who
had
fallen
*NL*
into
a
pit
:
my
concern
was
with
the
pit
and
how
to
get
out
of
it
.
*NL*
Now
I
felt
like
a
beast
in
a
trap
,
whose
enemy
would
come
upon
him
*NL*
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
enemy
I
dreaded
may
surprise
you
.
It
was
the
darkness
of
the
*NL*
new
moon
.
Weena
had
put
this
into
my
head
by
some
at
first
*NL*
incomprehensible
remarks
about
the
Dark
Nights
.
It
was
not
now
*NL*
such
a
very
difficult
problem
to
guess
what
the
coming
Dark
Nights
*NL*
might
mean
.
The
moon
was
on
the
wane
:
each
night
there
was
a
longer
*NL*
interval
of
darkness
.
And
I
now
understood
to
some
slight
degree
at
*NL*
least
the
reason
of
the
fear
of
the
little
Upper-world
people
for
*NL*
the
dark
.
I
wondered
vaguely
what
foul
villainy
it
might
be
that
*NL*
the
Morlocks
did
under
the
new
moon
.
I
felt
pretty
sure
now
that
*NL*
my
second
hypothesis
was
all
wrong
.
The
Upper-world
people
might
*NL*
once
have
been
the
favoured
aristocracy
,
and
the
Morlocks
their
*NL*
mechanical
servants
:
but
that
had
long
since
passed
away
.
The
two
*NL*
species
that
had
resulted
from
the
evolution
of
man
were
sliding
*NL*
down
towards
,
or
had
already
arrived
at
,
an
altogether
new
*NL*
relationship
.
The
Eloi
,
like
the
Carolingian
kings
,
had
decayed
*NL*
to
a
mere
beautiful
futility
.
They
still
possessed
the
earth
on
*NL*
sufferance
:
since
the
Morlocks
,
subterranean
for
innumerable
*NL*
generations
,
had
come
at
last
to
find
the
daylit
surface
*NL*
intolerable
.
And
the
Morlocks
made
their
garments
,
I
inferred
,
and
*NL*
maintained
them
in
their
habitual
needs
,
perhaps
through
the
*NL*
survival
of
an
old
habit
of
service
.
They
did
it
as
a
standing
horse
*NL*
paws
with
his
foot
,
or
as
a
man
enjoys
killing
animals
in
sport
:
*NL*
because
ancient
and
departed
necessities
had
impressed
it
on
the
*NL*
organism
.
But
,
clearly
,
the
old
order
was
already
in
part
reversed
.
*NL*
The
Nemesis
of
the
delicate
ones
was
creeping
on
apace
.
Ages
ago
,
*NL*
thousands
of
generations
ago
,
man
had
thrust
his
brother
man
out
of
*NL*
the
ease
and
the
sunshine
.
And
now
that
brother
was
coming
back
*NL*
changed
!
Already
the
Eloi
had
begun
to
learn
one
old
lesson
anew
.
*NL*
They
were
becoming
reacquainted
with
Fear
.
And
suddenly
there
came
*NL*
into
my
head
the
memory
of
the
meat
I
had
seen
in
the
Under-world
.
*NL*
It
seemed
odd
how
it
floated
into
my
mind
:
not
stirred
up
as
it
*NL*
were
by
the
current
of
my
meditations
,
but
coming
in
almost
like
a
*NL*
question
from
outside
.
I
tried
to
recall
the
form
of
it
.
I
had
a
*NL*
vague
sense
of
something
familiar
,
but
I
could
not
tell
what
it
was
*NL*
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Still
,
however
helpless
the
little
people
in
the
presence
of
their
*NL*
mysterious
Fear
,
I
was
differently
constituted
.
I
came
out
of
this
*NL*
age
of
ours
,
this
ripe
prime
of
the
human
race
,
when
Fear
does
not
*NL*
paralyse
and
mystery
has
lost
its
terrors
.
I
at
least
would
defend
*NL*
myself
.
Without
further
delay
I
determined
to
make
myself
arms
and
a
*NL*
fastness
where
I
might
sleep
.
With
that
refuge
as
a
base
,
I
could
*NL*
face
this
strange
world
with
some
of
that
confidence
I
had
lost
in
*NL*
realizing
to
what
creatures
night
by
night
I
lay
exposed
.
I
felt
*NL*
I
could
never
sleep
again
until
my
bed
was
secure
from
them
.
I
*NL*
shuddered
with
horror
to
think
how
they
must
already
have
examined
*NL*
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wandered
during
the
afternoon
along
the
valley
of
the
Thames
,
but
*NL*
found
nothing
that
commended
itself
to
my
mind
as
inaccessible
.
All
*NL*
the
buildings
and
trees
seemed
easily
practicable
to
such
dexterous
*NL*
climbers
as
the
Morlocks
,
to
judge
by
their
wells
,
must
be
.
Then
the
*NL*
tall
pinnacles
of
the
Palace
of
Green
Porcelain
and
the
polished
*NL*
gleam
of
its
walls
came
back
to
my
memory
;
and
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
taking
Weena
like
a
child
upon
my
shoulder
,
I
went
up
the
hills
*NL*
towards
the
south-west
.
The
distance
,
I
had
reckoned
,
was
seven
or
*NL*
eight
miles
,
but
it
must
have
been
nearer
eighteen
.
I
had
first
seen
*NL*
the
place
on
a
moist
afternoon
when
distances
are
deceptively
*NL*
diminished
.
In
addition
,
the
heel
of
one
of
my
shoes
was
loose
,
and
*NL*
a
nail
was
working
through
the
sole
--
they
were
comfortable
old
shoes
*NL*
I
wore
about
indoors
--
so
that
I
was
lame
.
And
it
was
already
long
*NL*
past
sunset
when
I
came
in
sight
of
the
palace
,
silhouetted
black
*NL*
against
the
pale
yellow
of
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Weena
had
been
hugely
delighted
when
I
began
to
carry
her
,
but
*NL*
after
a
while
she
desired
me
to
let
her
down
,
and
ran
along
by
the
*NL*
side
of
me
,
occasionally
darting
off
on
either
hand
to
pick
flowers
*NL*
to
stick
in
my
pockets
.
My
pockets
had
always
puzzled
Weena
,
but
at
*NL*
the
last
she
had
concluded
that
they
were
an
eccentric
kind
of
vase
*NL*
for
floral
decoration
.
At
least
she
utilized
them
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
And
that
reminds
me
!
In
changing
my
jacket
I
found
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
paused
,
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
and
*NL*
silently
placed
two
withered
flowers
,
not
unlike
very
large
white
*NL*
mallows
,
upon
the
little
table
.
Then
he
resumed
his
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
the
hush
of
evening
crept
over
the
world
and
we
proceeded
over
*NL*
the
hill
crest
towards
Wimbledon
,
Weena
grew
tired
and
wanted
to
*NL*
return
to
the
house
of
grey
stone
.
But
I
pointed
out
the
distant
*NL*
pinnacles
of
the
Palace
of
Green
Porcelain
to
her
,
and
contrived
to
*NL*
make
her
understand
that
we
were
seeking
a
refuge
there
from
her
*NL*
Fear
.
You
know
that
great
pause
that
comes
upon
things
before
the
*NL*
dusk
?
Even
the
breeze
stops
in
the
trees
.
To
me
there
is
always
an
*NL*
air
of
expectation
about
that
evening
stillness
.
The
sky
was
clear
,
*NL*
remote
,
and
empty
save
for
a
few
horizontal
bars
far
down
in
the
*NL*
sunset
.
Well
,
that
night
the
expectation
took
the
colour
of
my
*NL*
fears
.
In
that
darkling
calm
my
senses
seemed
preternaturally
*NL*
sharpened
.
I
fancied
I
could
even
feel
the
hollowness
of
the
ground
*NL*
beneath
my
feet
:
could
,
indeed
,
almost
see
through
it
the
Morlocks
*NL*
on
their
ant-hill
going
hither
and
thither
and
waiting
for
the
dark
.
*NL*
In
my
excitement
I
fancied
that
they
would
receive
my
invasion
of
*NL*
their
burrows
as
a
declaration
of
war
.
And
why
had
they
taken
my
*NL*
Time
Machine
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
we
went
on
in
the
quiet
,
and
the
twilight
deepened
into
night
.
*NL*
The
clear
blue
of
the
distance
faded
,
and
one
star
after
another
*NL*
came
out
.
The
ground
grew
dim
and
the
trees
black
.
Weena
's
fears
and
*NL*
her
fatigue
grew
upon
her
.
I
took
her
in
my
arms
and
talked
to
her
*NL*
and
caressed
her
.
Then
,
as
the
darkness
grew
deeper
,
she
put
her
*NL*
arms
round
my
neck
,
and
,
closing
her
eyes
,
tightly
pressed
her
face
*NL*
against
my
shoulder
.
So
we
went
down
a
long
slope
into
a
valley
,
and
*NL*
there
in
the
dimness
I
almost
walked
into
a
little
river
.
This
I
*NL*
waded
,
and
went
up
the
opposite
side
of
the
valley
,
past
a
number
*NL*
of
sleeping
houses
,
and
by
a
statue
--
a
Faun
,
or
some
such
figure
,
*NL*
_
minus
_
the
head
.
Here
too
were
acacias
.
So
far
I
had
seen
nothing
of
*NL*
the
Morlocks
,
but
it
was
yet
early
in
the
night
,
and
the
darker
hours
*NL*
before
the
old
moon
rose
were
still
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
From
the
brow
of
the
next
hill
I
saw
a
thick
wood
spreading
wide
*NL*
and
black
before
me
.
I
hesitated
at
this
.
I
could
see
no
end
to
*NL*
it
,
either
to
the
right
or
the
left
.
Feeling
tired
--
my
feet
,
in
*NL*
particular
,
were
very
sore
--
I
carefully
lowered
Weena
from
my
*NL*
shoulder
as
I
halted
,
and
sat
down
upon
the
turf
.
I
could
no
*NL*
longer
see
the
Palace
of
Green
Porcelain
,
and
I
was
in
doubt
of
my
*NL*
direction
.
I
looked
into
the
thickness
of
the
wood
and
thought
of
*NL*
what
it
might
hide
.
Under
that
dense
tangle
of
branches
one
would
*NL*
be
out
of
sight
of
the
stars
.
Even
were
there
no
other
lurking
*NL*
danger
--
a
danger
I
did
not
care
to
let
my
imagination
loose
*NL*
upon
--
there
would
still
be
all
the
roots
to
stumble
over
and
the
*NL*
tree-boles
to
strike
against
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
very
tired
,
too
,
after
the
excitements
of
the
day
;
so
I
*NL*
decided
that
I
would
not
face
it
,
but
would
pass
the
night
upon
the
*NL*
open
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Weena
,
I
was
glad
to
find
,
was
fast
asleep
.
I
carefully
wrapped
her
*NL*
in
my
jacket
,
and
sat
down
beside
her
to
wait
for
the
moonrise
.
The
*NL*
hill-side
was
quiet
and
deserted
,
but
from
the
black
of
the
wood
*NL*
there
came
now
and
then
a
stir
of
living
things
.
Above
me
shone
the
*NL*
stars
,
for
the
night
was
very
clear
.
I
felt
a
certain
sense
of
*NL*
friendly
comfort
in
their
twinkling
.
All
the
old
constellations
*NL*
had
gone
from
the
sky
,
however
:
that
slow
movement
which
is
*NL*
imperceptible
in
a
hundred
human
lifetimes
,
had
long
since
*NL*
rearranged
them
in
unfamiliar
groupings
.
But
the
Milky
Way
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
me
,
was
still
the
same
tattered
streamer
of
star-dust
as
*NL*
of
yore
.
Southward
-LRB-
as
I
judged
it
-RRB-
was
a
very
bright
red
star
that
*NL*
was
new
to
me
;
it
was
even
more
splendid
than
our
own
green
Sirius
.
*NL*
And
amid
all
these
scintillating
points
of
light
one
bright
planet
*NL*
shone
kindly
and
steadily
like
the
face
of
an
old
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Looking
at
these
stars
suddenly
dwarfed
my
own
troubles
and
all
*NL*
the
gravities
of
terrestrial
life
.
I
thought
of
their
unfathomable
*NL*
distance
,
and
the
slow
inevitable
drift
of
their
movements
out
of
*NL*
the
unknown
past
into
the
unknown
future
.
I
thought
of
the
great
*NL*
precessional
cycle
that
the
pole
of
the
earth
describes
.
Only
forty
*NL*
times
had
that
silent
revolution
occurred
during
all
the
years
that
*NL*
I
had
traversed
.
And
during
these
few
revolutions
all
the
activity
,
*NL*
all
the
traditions
,
the
complex
organizations
,
the
nations
,
*NL*
languages
,
literatures
,
aspirations
,
even
the
mere
memory
of
Man
as
*NL*
I
knew
him
,
had
been
swept
out
of
existence
.
Instead
were
these
*NL*
frail
creatures
who
had
forgotten
their
high
ancestry
,
and
the
white
*NL*
Things
of
which
I
went
in
terror
.
Then
I
thought
of
the
Great
Fear
*NL*
that
was
between
the
two
species
,
and
for
the
first
time
,
with
a
*NL*
sudden
shiver
,
came
the
clear
knowledge
of
what
the
meat
I
had
seen
*NL*
might
be
.
Yet
it
was
too
horrible
!
I
looked
at
little
Weena
sleeping
*NL*
beside
me
,
her
face
white
and
starlike
under
the
stars
,
and
*NL*
forthwith
dismissed
the
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Through
that
long
night
I
held
my
mind
off
the
Morlocks
as
well
as
*NL*
I
could
,
and
whiled
away
the
time
by
trying
to
fancy
I
could
find
*NL*
signs
of
the
old
constellations
in
the
new
confusion
.
The
sky
kept
*NL*
very
clear
,
except
for
a
hazy
cloud
or
so
.
No
doubt
I
dozed
at
*NL*
times
.
Then
,
as
my
vigil
wore
on
,
came
a
faintness
in
the
eastward
*NL*
sky
,
like
the
reflection
of
some
colourless
fire
,
and
the
old
moon
*NL*
rose
,
thin
and
peaked
and
white
.
And
close
behind
,
and
overtaking
*NL*
it
,
and
overflowing
it
,
the
dawn
came
,
pale
at
first
,
and
then
*NL*
growing
pink
and
warm
.
No
Morlocks
had
approached
us
.
Indeed
,
I
had
*NL*
seen
none
upon
the
hill
that
night
.
And
in
the
confidence
of
renewed
*NL*
day
it
almost
seemed
to
me
that
my
fear
had
been
unreasonable
.
I
*NL*
stood
up
and
found
my
foot
with
the
loose
heel
swollen
at
the
ankle
*NL*
and
painful
under
the
heel
;
so
I
sat
down
again
,
took
off
my
shoes
,
*NL*
and
flung
them
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
awakened
Weena
,
and
we
went
down
into
the
wood
,
now
green
and
*NL*
pleasant
instead
of
black
and
forbidding
.
We
found
some
fruit
*NL*
wherewith
to
break
our
fast
.
We
soon
met
others
of
the
dainty
ones
,
*NL*
laughing
and
dancing
in
the
sunlight
as
though
there
was
no
such
*NL*
thing
in
nature
as
the
night
.
And
then
I
thought
once
more
of
the
*NL*
meat
that
I
had
seen
.
I
felt
assured
now
of
what
it
was
,
and
from
*NL*
the
bottom
of
my
heart
I
pitied
this
last
feeble
rill
from
the
great
*NL*
flood
of
humanity
.
Clearly
,
at
some
time
in
the
Long-Ago
of
human
*NL*
decay
the
Morlocks
'
food
had
run
short
.
Possibly
they
had
lived
on
*NL*
rats
and
such-like
vermin
.
Even
now
man
is
far
less
discriminating
*NL*
and
exclusive
in
his
food
than
he
was
--
far
less
than
any
monkey
.
His
*NL*
prejudice
against
human
flesh
is
no
deep-seated
instinct
.
And
so
*NL*
these
inhuman
sons
of
men
--
!
I
tried
to
look
at
the
thing
in
a
*NL*
scientific
spirit
.
After
all
,
they
were
less
human
and
more
remote
*NL*
than
our
cannibal
ancestors
of
three
or
four
thousand
years
ago
.
*NL*
And
the
intelligence
that
would
have
made
this
state
of
things
a
*NL*
torment
had
gone
.
Why
should
I
trouble
myself
?
These
Eloi
were
mere
*NL*
fatted
cattle
,
which
the
ant-like
Morlocks
preserved
and
preyed
*NL*
upon
--
probably
saw
to
the
breeding
of
.
And
there
was
Weena
dancing
*NL*
at
my
side
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
tried
to
preserve
myself
from
the
horror
that
was
coming
*NL*
upon
me
,
by
regarding
it
as
a
rigorous
punishment
of
human
*NL*
selfishness
.
Man
had
been
content
to
live
in
ease
and
delight
upon
*NL*
the
labours
of
his
fellow-man
,
had
taken
Necessity
as
his
watchword
*NL*
and
excuse
,
and
in
the
fullness
of
time
Necessity
had
come
home
to
*NL*
him
.
I
even
tried
a
Carlyle-like
scorn
of
this
wretched
aristocracy
*NL*
in
decay
.
But
this
attitude
of
mind
was
impossible
.
However
great
*NL*
their
intellectual
degradation
,
the
Eloi
had
kept
too
much
of
the
*NL*
human
form
not
to
claim
my
sympathy
,
and
to
make
me
perforce
a
*NL*
sharer
in
their
degradation
and
their
Fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
had
at
that
time
very
vague
ideas
as
to
the
course
I
should
*NL*
pursue
.
My
first
was
to
secure
some
safe
place
of
refuge
,
and
to
*NL*
make
myself
such
arms
of
metal
or
stone
as
I
could
contrive
.
That
*NL*
necessity
was
immediate
.
In
the
next
place
,
I
hoped
to
procure
some
*NL*
means
of
fire
,
so
that
I
should
have
the
weapon
of
a
torch
at
hand
,
*NL*
for
nothing
,
I
knew
,
would
be
more
efficient
against
these
Morlocks
.
*NL*
Then
I
wanted
to
arrange
some
contrivance
to
break
open
the
doors
of
*NL*
bronze
under
the
White
Sphinx
.
I
had
in
mind
a
battering
ram
.
I
had
*NL*
a
persuasion
that
if
I
could
enter
those
doors
and
carry
a
blaze
of
*NL*
light
before
me
I
should
discover
the
Time
Machine
and
escape
.
I
*NL*
could
not
imagine
the
Morlocks
were
strong
enough
to
move
it
far
*NL*
away
.
Weena
I
had
resolved
to
bring
with
me
to
our
own
time
.
And
*NL*
turning
such
schemes
over
in
my
mind
I
pursued
our
way
towards
the
*NL*
building
which
my
fancy
had
chosen
as
our
dwelling
.

*NL*
*NL*
'
I
found
the
Palace
of
Green
Porcelain
,
when
we
approached
it
about
*NL*
noon
,
deserted
and
falling
into
ruin
.
Only
ragged
vestiges
of
glass
*NL*
remained
in
its
windows
,
and
great
sheets
of
the
green
facing
had
*NL*
fallen
away
from
the
corroded
metallic
framework
.
It
lay
very
high
*NL*
upon
a
turfy
down
,
and
looking
north-eastward
before
I
entered
it
,
I
*NL*
was
surprised
to
see
a
large
estuary
,
or
even
creek
,
where
I
judged
*NL*
Wandsworth
and
Battersea
must
once
have
been
.
I
thought
then
--
though
*NL*
I
never
followed
up
the
thought
--
of
what
might
have
happened
,
or
*NL*
might
be
happening
,
to
the
living
things
in
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
material
of
the
Palace
proved
on
examination
to
be
indeed
*NL*
porcelain
,
and
along
the
face
of
it
I
saw
an
inscription
in
some
*NL*
unknown
character
.
I
thought
,
rather
foolishly
,
that
Weena
might
*NL*
help
me
to
interpret
this
,
but
I
only
learned
that
the
bare
idea
of
*NL*
writing
had
never
entered
her
head
.
She
always
seemed
to
me
,
I
*NL*
fancy
,
more
human
than
she
was
,
perhaps
because
her
affection
was
so
*NL*
human
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Within
the
big
valves
of
the
door
--
which
were
open
and
broken
--
we
*NL*
found
,
instead
of
the
customary
hall
,
a
long
gallery
lit
by
many
*NL*
side
windows
.
At
the
first
glance
I
was
reminded
of
a
museum
.
*NL*
The
tiled
floor
was
thick
with
dust
,
and
a
remarkable
array
of
*NL*
miscellaneous
objects
was
shrouded
in
the
same
grey
covering
.
Then
*NL*
I
perceived
,
standing
strange
and
gaunt
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
,
*NL*
what
was
clearly
the
lower
part
of
a
huge
skeleton
.
I
recognized
*NL*
by
the
oblique
feet
that
it
was
some
extinct
creature
after
the
*NL*
fashion
of
the
Megatherium
.
The
skull
and
the
upper
bones
lay
*NL*
beside
it
in
the
thick
dust
,
and
in
one
place
,
where
rain-water
had
*NL*
dropped
through
a
leak
in
the
roof
,
the
thing
itself
had
been
worn
*NL*
away
.
Further
in
the
gallery
was
the
huge
skeleton
barrel
of
a
*NL*
Brontosaurus
.
My
museum
hypothesis
was
confirmed
.
Going
towards
the
*NL*
side
I
found
what
appeared
to
be
sloping
shelves
,
and
clearing
away
*NL*
the
thick
dust
,
I
found
the
old
familiar
glass
cases
of
our
own
*NL*
time
.
But
they
must
have
been
air-tight
to
judge
from
the
fair
*NL*
preservation
of
some
of
their
contents
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Clearly
we
stood
among
the
ruins
of
some
latter-day
South
*NL*
Kensington
!
Here
,
apparently
,
was
the
Palaeontological
Section
,
*NL*
and
a
very
splendid
array
of
fossils
it
must
have
been
,
though
the
*NL*
inevitable
process
of
decay
that
had
been
staved
off
for
a
time
,
and
*NL*
had
,
through
the
extinction
of
bacteria
and
fungi
,
lost
ninety-nine
*NL*
hundredths
of
its
force
,
was
nevertheless
,
with
extreme
sureness
if
*NL*
with
extreme
slowness
at
work
again
upon
all
its
treasures
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
I
found
traces
of
the
little
people
in
the
shape
of
rare
*NL*
fossils
broken
to
pieces
or
threaded
in
strings
upon
reeds
.
And
the
*NL*
cases
had
in
some
instances
been
bodily
removed
--
by
the
Morlocks
as
*NL*
I
judged
.
The
place
was
very
silent
.
The
thick
dust
deadened
our
*NL*
footsteps
.
Weena
,
who
had
been
rolling
a
sea
urchin
down
the
sloping
*NL*
glass
of
a
case
,
presently
came
,
as
I
stared
about
me
,
and
very
*NL*
quietly
took
my
hand
and
stood
beside
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
at
first
I
was
so
much
surprised
by
this
ancient
monument
of
an
*NL*
intellectual
age
,
that
I
gave
no
thought
to
the
possibilities
it
*NL*
presented
.
Even
my
preoccupation
about
the
Time
Machine
receded
a
*NL*
little
from
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
judge
from
the
size
of
the
place
,
this
Palace
of
Green
Porcelain
*NL*
had
a
great
deal
more
in
it
than
a
Gallery
of
Palaeontology
;
*NL*
possibly
historical
galleries
;
it
might
be
,
even
a
library
!
To
me
,
*NL*
at
least
in
my
present
circumstances
,
these
would
be
vastly
more
*NL*
interesting
than
this
spectacle
of
oldtime
geology
in
decay
.
*NL*
Exploring
,
I
found
another
short
gallery
running
transversely
to
the
*NL*
first
.
This
appeared
to
be
devoted
to
minerals
,
and
the
sight
of
a
*NL*
block
of
sulphur
set
my
mind
running
on
gunpowder
.
But
I
could
find
*NL*
no
saltpeter
;
indeed
,
no
nitrates
of
any
kind
.
Doubtless
they
had
*NL*
deliquesced
ages
ago
.
Yet
the
sulphur
hung
in
my
mind
,
and
set
up
a
*NL*
train
of
thinking
.
As
for
the
rest
of
the
contents
of
that
gallery
,
*NL*
though
on
the
whole
they
were
the
best
preserved
of
all
I
saw
,
I
had
*NL*
little
interest
.
I
am
no
specialist
in
mineralogy
,
and
I
went
on
*NL*
down
a
very
ruinous
aisle
running
parallel
to
the
first
hall
I
had
*NL*
entered
.
Apparently
this
section
had
been
devoted
to
natural
*NL*
history
,
but
everything
had
long
since
passed
out
of
recognition
.
A
*NL*
few
shrivelled
and
blackened
vestiges
of
what
had
once
been
stuffed
*NL*
animals
,
desiccated
mummies
in
jars
that
had
once
held
spirit
,
a
*NL*
brown
dust
of
departed
plants
:
that
was
all
!
I
was
sorry
for
that
,
*NL*
because
I
should
have
been
glad
to
trace
the
patent
readjustments
by
*NL*
which
the
conquest
of
animated
nature
had
been
attained
.
Then
we
*NL*
came
to
a
gallery
of
simply
colossal
proportions
,
but
singularly
*NL*
ill-lit
,
the
floor
of
it
running
downward
at
a
slight
angle
from
the
*NL*
end
at
which
I
entered
.
At
intervals
white
globes
hung
from
the
*NL*
ceiling
--
many
of
them
cracked
and
smashed
--
which
suggested
that
*NL*
originally
the
place
had
been
artificially
lit
.
Here
I
was
more
in
*NL*
my
element
,
for
rising
on
either
side
of
me
were
the
huge
bulks
of
*NL*
big
machines
,
all
greatly
corroded
and
many
broken
down
,
but
some
*NL*
still
fairly
complete
.
You
know
I
have
a
certain
weakness
for
*NL*
mechanism
,
and
I
was
inclined
to
linger
among
these
;
the
more
so
as
*NL*
for
the
most
part
they
had
the
interest
of
puzzles
,
and
I
could
make
*NL*
only
the
vaguest
guesses
at
what
they
were
for
.
I
fancied
that
if
*NL*
I
could
solve
their
puzzles
I
should
find
myself
in
possession
of
*NL*
powers
that
might
be
of
use
against
the
Morlocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suddenly
Weena
came
very
close
to
my
side
.
So
suddenly
that
she
*NL*
startled
me
.
Had
it
not
been
for
her
I
do
not
think
I
should
have
*NL*
noticed
that
the
floor
of
the
gallery
sloped
at
all
.

Footnote
:
It
*NL*
may
be
,
of
course
,
that
the
floor
did
not
slope
,
but
that
the
museum
*NL*
was
built
into
the
side
of
a
hill
.

The
end
I
had
come
in
at
*NL*
was
quite
above
ground
,
and
was
lit
by
rare
slit-like
windows
.
As
*NL*
you
went
down
the
length
,
the
ground
came
up
against
these
windows
,
*NL*
until
at
last
there
was
a
pit
like
the
``
area
''
of
a
London
house
*NL*
before
each
,
and
only
a
narrow
line
of
daylight
at
the
top
.
I
went
*NL*
slowly
along
,
puzzling
about
the
machines
,
and
had
been
too
intent
*NL*
upon
them
to
notice
the
gradual
diminution
of
the
light
,
until
*NL*
Weena
's
increasing
apprehensions
drew
my
attention
.
Then
I
saw
that
*NL*
the
gallery
ran
down
at
last
into
a
thick
darkness
.
I
hesitated
,
and
*NL*
then
,
as
I
looked
round
me
,
I
saw
that
the
dust
was
less
abundant
*NL*
and
its
surface
less
even
.
Further
away
towards
the
dimness
,
it
*NL*
appeared
to
be
broken
by
a
number
of
small
narrow
footprints
.
My
*NL*
sense
of
the
immediate
presence
of
the
Morlocks
revived
at
that
.
*NL*
I
felt
that
I
was
wasting
my
time
in
the
academic
examination
of
*NL*
machinery
.
I
called
to
mind
that
it
was
already
far
advanced
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
that
I
had
still
no
weapon
,
no
refuge
,
and
no
means
*NL*
of
making
a
fire
.
And
then
down
in
the
remote
blackness
of
the
*NL*
gallery
I
heard
a
peculiar
pattering
,
and
the
same
odd
noises
I
had
*NL*
heard
down
the
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
took
Weena
's
hand
.
Then
,
struck
with
a
sudden
idea
,
I
left
her
*NL*
and
turned
to
a
machine
from
which
projected
a
lever
not
unlike
*NL*
those
in
a
signal-box
.
Clambering
upon
the
stand
,
and
grasping
this
*NL*
lever
in
my
hands
,
I
put
all
my
weight
upon
it
sideways
.
Suddenly
*NL*
Weena
,
deserted
in
the
central
aisle
,
began
to
whimper
.
I
had
judged
*NL*
the
strength
of
the
lever
pretty
correctly
,
for
it
snapped
after
a
*NL*
minute
's
strain
,
and
I
rejoined
her
with
a
mace
in
my
hand
more
than
*NL*
sufficient
,
I
judged
,
for
any
Morlock
skull
I
might
encounter
.
And
I
*NL*
longed
very
much
to
kill
a
Morlock
or
so
.
Very
inhuman
,
you
may
*NL*
think
,
to
want
to
go
killing
one
's
own
descendants
!
But
it
was
*NL*
impossible
,
somehow
,
to
feel
any
humanity
in
the
things
.
Only
my
*NL*
disinclination
to
leave
Weena
,
and
a
persuasion
that
if
I
began
to
*NL*
slake
my
thirst
for
murder
my
Time
Machine
might
suffer
,
restrained
*NL*
me
from
going
straight
down
the
gallery
and
killing
the
brutes
I
*NL*
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
mace
in
one
hand
and
Weena
in
the
other
,
I
went
out
of
that
*NL*
gallery
and
into
another
and
still
larger
one
,
which
at
the
first
*NL*
glance
reminded
me
of
a
military
chapel
hung
with
tattered
flags
.
*NL*
The
brown
and
charred
rags
that
hung
from
the
sides
of
it
,
I
*NL*
presently
recognized
as
the
decaying
vestiges
of
books
.
They
had
*NL*
long
since
dropped
to
pieces
,
and
every
semblance
of
print
had
left
*NL*
them
.
But
here
and
there
were
warped
boards
and
cracked
metallic
*NL*
clasps
that
told
the
tale
well
enough
.
Had
I
been
a
literary
man
I
*NL*
might
,
perhaps
,
have
moralized
upon
the
futility
of
all
ambition
.
*NL*
But
as
it
was
,
the
thing
that
struck
me
with
keenest
force
was
the
*NL*
enormous
waste
of
labour
to
which
this
sombre
wilderness
of
rotting
*NL*
paper
testified
.
At
the
time
I
will
confess
that
I
thought
chiefly
*NL*
of
the
_
Philosophical
Transactions
_
and
my
own
seventeen
papers
upon
*NL*
physical
optics
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
going
up
a
broad
staircase
,
we
came
to
what
may
once
have
*NL*
been
a
gallery
of
technical
chemistry
.
And
here
I
had
not
a
little
*NL*
hope
of
useful
discoveries
.
Except
at
one
end
where
the
roof
had
*NL*
collapsed
,
this
gallery
was
well
preserved
.
I
went
eagerly
to
every
*NL*
unbroken
case
.
And
at
last
,
in
one
of
the
really
air-tight
cases
,
*NL*
I
found
a
box
of
matches
.
Very
eagerly
I
tried
them
.
They
were
*NL*
perfectly
good
.
They
were
not
even
damp
.
I
turned
to
Weena
.
``
Dance
,
''
*NL*
I
cried
to
her
in
her
own
tongue
.
For
now
I
had
a
weapon
indeed
*NL*
against
the
horrible
creatures
we
feared
.
And
so
,
in
that
derelict
*NL*
museum
,
upon
the
thick
soft
carpeting
of
dust
,
to
Weena
's
huge
*NL*
delight
,
I
solemnly
performed
a
kind
of
composite
dance
,
whistling
*NL*
_
The
Land
of
the
Leal
_
as
cheerfully
as
I
could
.
In
part
it
was
a
*NL*
modest
_
cancan
_
,
in
part
a
step
dance
,
in
part
a
skirt-dance
-LRB-
so
far
*NL*
as
my
tail-coat
permitted
-RRB-
,
and
in
part
original
.
For
I
am
naturally
*NL*
inventive
,
as
you
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
I
still
think
that
for
this
box
of
matches
to
have
escaped
*NL*
the
wear
of
time
for
immemorial
years
was
a
most
strange
,
as
for
*NL*
me
it
was
a
most
fortunate
thing
.
Yet
,
oddly
enough
,
I
found
a
far
*NL*
unlikelier
substance
,
and
that
was
camphor
.
I
found
it
in
a
sealed
*NL*
jar
,
that
by
chance
,
I
suppose
,
had
been
really
hermetically
sealed
.
*NL*
I
fancied
at
first
that
it
was
paraffin
wax
,
and
smashed
the
glass
*NL*
accordingly
.
But
the
odour
of
camphor
was
unmistakable
.
In
the
*NL*
universal
decay
this
volatile
substance
had
chanced
to
survive
,
*NL*
perhaps
through
many
thousands
of
centuries
.
It
reminded
me
of
a
*NL*
sepia
painting
I
had
once
seen
done
from
the
ink
of
a
fossil
*NL*
Belemnite
that
must
have
perished
and
become
fossilized
millions
*NL*
of
years
ago
.
I
was
about
to
throw
it
away
,
but
I
remembered
that
*NL*
it
was
inflammable
and
burned
with
a
good
bright
flame
--
was
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
an
excellent
candle
--
and
I
put
it
in
my
pocket
.
I
found
no
*NL*
explosives
,
however
,
nor
any
means
of
breaking
down
the
bronze
*NL*
doors
.
As
yet
my
iron
crowbar
was
the
most
helpful
thing
I
had
*NL*
chanced
upon
.
Nevertheless
I
left
that
gallery
greatly
elated
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
not
tell
you
all
the
story
of
that
long
afternoon
.
It
would
*NL*
require
a
great
effort
of
memory
to
recall
my
explorations
in
at
all
*NL*
the
proper
order
.
I
remember
a
long
gallery
of
rusting
stands
of
*NL*
arms
,
and
how
I
hesitated
between
my
crowbar
and
a
hatchet
or
a
*NL*
sword
.
I
could
not
carry
both
,
however
,
and
my
bar
of
iron
promised
*NL*
best
against
the
bronze
gates
.
There
were
numbers
of
guns
,
pistols
,
*NL*
and
rifles
.
The
most
were
masses
of
rust
,
but
many
were
of
some
*NL*
new
metal
,
and
still
fairly
sound
.
But
any
cartridges
or
powder
*NL*
there
may
once
have
been
had
rotted
into
dust
.
One
corner
I
saw
was
*NL*
charred
and
shattered
;
perhaps
,
I
thought
,
by
an
explosion
among
the
*NL*
specimens
.
In
another
place
was
a
vast
array
of
idols
--
Polynesian
,
*NL*
Mexican
,
Grecian
,
Phoenician
,
every
country
on
earth
I
should
think
.
*NL*
And
here
,
yielding
to
an
irresistible
impulse
,
I
wrote
my
name
upon
*NL*
the
nose
of
a
steatite
monster
from
South
America
that
particularly
*NL*
took
my
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
the
evening
drew
on
,
my
interest
waned
.
I
went
through
gallery
*NL*
after
gallery
,
dusty
,
silent
,
often
ruinous
,
the
exhibits
sometimes
*NL*
mere
heaps
of
rust
and
lignite
,
sometimes
fresher
.
In
one
place
I
*NL*
suddenly
found
myself
near
the
model
of
a
tin-mine
,
and
then
by
the
*NL*
merest
accident
I
discovered
,
in
an
air-tight
case
,
two
dynamite
*NL*
cartridges
!
I
shouted
``
Eureka
!
''
and
smashed
the
case
with
joy
.
Then
*NL*
came
a
doubt
.
I
hesitated
.
Then
,
selecting
a
little
side
gallery
,
*NL*
I
made
my
essay
.
I
never
felt
such
a
disappointment
as
I
did
in
*NL*
waiting
five
,
ten
,
fifteen
minutes
for
an
explosion
that
never
came
.
*NL*
Of
course
the
things
were
dummies
,
as
I
might
have
guessed
from
*NL*
their
presence
.
I
really
believe
that
had
they
not
been
so
,
I
should
*NL*
have
rushed
off
incontinently
and
blown
Sphinx
,
bronze
doors
,
and
*NL*
-LRB-
as
it
proved
-RRB-
my
chances
of
finding
the
Time
Machine
,
all
together
*NL*
into
non-existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
after
that
,
I
think
,
that
we
came
to
a
little
open
court
*NL*
within
the
palace
.
It
was
turfed
,
and
had
three
fruit-trees
.
So
we
*NL*
rested
and
refreshed
ourselves
.
Towards
sunset
I
began
to
consider
*NL*
our
position
.
Night
was
creeping
upon
us
,
and
my
inaccessible
*NL*
hiding-place
had
still
to
be
found
.
But
that
troubled
me
very
little
*NL*
now
.
I
had
in
my
possession
a
thing
that
was
,
perhaps
,
the
best
of
*NL*
all
defences
against
the
Morlocks
--
I
had
matches
!
I
had
the
camphor
*NL*
in
my
pocket
,
too
,
if
a
blaze
were
needed
.
It
seemed
to
me
that
*NL*
the
best
thing
we
could
do
would
be
to
pass
the
night
in
the
open
,
*NL*
protected
by
a
fire
.
In
the
morning
there
was
the
getting
of
the
*NL*
Time
Machine
.
Towards
that
,
as
yet
,
I
had
only
my
iron
mace
.
But
*NL*
now
,
with
my
growing
knowledge
,
I
felt
very
differently
towards
*NL*
those
bronze
doors
.
Up
to
this
,
I
had
refrained
from
forcing
them
,
*NL*
largely
because
of
the
mystery
on
the
other
side
.
They
had
never
*NL*
impressed
me
as
being
very
strong
,
and
I
hoped
to
find
my
bar
of
*NL*
iron
not
altogether
inadequate
for
the
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
emerged
from
the
palace
while
the
sun
was
still
in
part
above
*NL*
the
horizon
.
I
was
determined
to
reach
the
White
Sphinx
early
the
*NL*
next
morning
,
and
ere
the
dusk
I
purposed
pushing
through
the
woods
*NL*
that
had
stopped
me
on
the
previous
journey
.
My
plan
was
to
go
as
*NL*
far
as
possible
that
night
,
and
then
,
building
a
fire
,
to
sleep
*NL*
in
the
protection
of
its
glare
.
Accordingly
,
as
we
went
along
I
*NL*
gathered
any
sticks
or
dried
grass
I
saw
,
and
presently
had
my
arms
*NL*
full
of
such
litter
.
Thus
loaded
,
our
progress
was
slower
than
I
had
*NL*
anticipated
,
and
besides
Weena
was
tired
.
And
I
began
to
suffer
from
*NL*
sleepiness
too
;
so
that
it
was
full
night
before
we
reached
the
*NL*
wood
.
Upon
the
shrubby
hill
of
its
edge
Weena
would
have
stopped
,
*NL*
fearing
the
darkness
before
us
;
but
a
singular
sense
of
impending
*NL*
calamity
,
that
should
indeed
have
served
me
as
a
warning
,
drove
me
*NL*
onward
.
I
had
been
without
sleep
for
a
night
and
two
days
,
and
I
was
*NL*
feverish
and
irritable
.
I
felt
sleep
coming
upon
me
,
and
the
*NL*
Morlocks
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
While
we
hesitated
,
among
the
black
bushes
behind
us
,
and
dim
*NL*
against
their
blackness
,
I
saw
three
crouching
figures
.
There
was
*NL*
scrub
and
long
grass
all
about
us
,
and
I
did
not
feel
safe
from
*NL*
their
insidious
approach
.
The
forest
,
I
calculated
,
was
rather
*NL*
less
than
a
mile
across
.
If
we
could
get
through
it
to
the
bare
*NL*
hill-side
,
there
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
was
an
altogether
safer
*NL*
resting-place
;
I
thought
that
with
my
matches
and
my
camphor
I
could
*NL*
contrive
to
keep
my
path
illuminated
through
the
woods
.
Yet
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
if
I
was
to
flourish
matches
with
my
hands
I
should
*NL*
have
to
abandon
my
firewood
;
so
,
rather
reluctantly
,
I
put
it
down
.
*NL*
And
then
it
came
into
my
head
that
I
would
amaze
our
friends
behind
*NL*
by
lighting
it
.
I
was
to
discover
the
atrocious
folly
of
this
*NL*
proceeding
,
but
it
came
to
my
mind
as
an
ingenious
move
for
covering
*NL*
our
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
if
you
have
ever
thought
what
a
rare
thing
flame
must
*NL*
be
in
the
absence
of
man
and
in
a
temperate
climate
.
The
sun
's
*NL*
heat
is
rarely
strong
enough
to
burn
,
even
when
it
is
focused
by
*NL*
dewdrops
,
as
is
sometimes
the
case
in
more
tropical
districts
.
*NL*
Lightning
may
blast
and
blacken
,
but
it
rarely
gives
rise
to
*NL*
widespread
fire
.
Decaying
vegetation
may
occasionally
smoulder
with
*NL*
the
heat
of
its
fermentation
,
but
this
rarely
results
in
flame
.
In
*NL*
this
decadence
,
too
,
the
art
of
fire-making
had
been
forgotten
on
*NL*
the
earth
.
The
red
tongues
that
went
licking
up
my
heap
of
wood
were
*NL*
an
altogether
new
and
strange
thing
to
Weena
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
wanted
to
run
to
it
and
play
with
it
.
I
believe
she
would
have
*NL*
cast
herself
into
it
had
I
not
restrained
her
.
But
I
caught
her
up
,
*NL*
and
in
spite
of
her
struggles
,
plunged
boldly
before
me
into
the
*NL*
wood
.
For
a
little
way
the
glare
of
my
fire
lit
the
path
.
Looking
*NL*
back
presently
,
I
could
see
,
through
the
crowded
stems
,
that
from
my
*NL*
heap
of
sticks
the
blaze
had
spread
to
some
bushes
adjacent
,
and
a
*NL*
curved
line
of
fire
was
creeping
up
the
grass
of
the
hill
.
I
laughed
*NL*
at
that
,
and
turned
again
to
the
dark
trees
before
me
.
It
was
very
*NL*
black
,
and
Weena
clung
to
me
convulsively
,
but
there
was
still
,
as
*NL*
my
eyes
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
,
sufficient
light
for
me
to
*NL*
avoid
the
stems
.
Overhead
it
was
simply
black
,
except
where
a
gap
of
*NL*
remote
blue
sky
shone
down
upon
us
here
and
there
.
I
struck
none
of
*NL*
my
matches
because
I
had
no
hand
free
.
Upon
my
left
arm
I
carried
my
*NL*
little
one
,
in
my
right
hand
I
had
my
iron
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
some
way
I
heard
nothing
but
the
crackling
twigs
under
my
feet
,
*NL*
the
faint
rustle
of
the
breeze
above
,
and
my
own
breathing
and
the
*NL*
throb
of
the
blood-vessels
in
my
ears
.
Then
I
seemed
to
know
of
a
*NL*
pattering
about
me
.
I
pushed
on
grimly
.
The
pattering
grew
more
*NL*
distinct
,
and
then
I
caught
the
same
queer
sound
and
voices
I
had
*NL*
heard
in
the
Under-world
.
There
were
evidently
several
of
the
*NL*
Morlocks
,
and
they
were
closing
in
upon
me
.
Indeed
,
in
another
*NL*
minute
I
felt
a
tug
at
my
coat
,
then
something
at
my
arm
.
And
Weena
*NL*
shivered
violently
,
and
became
quite
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
time
for
a
match
.
But
to
get
one
I
must
put
her
down
.
I
did
*NL*
so
,
and
,
as
I
fumbled
with
my
pocket
,
a
struggle
began
in
the
*NL*
darkness
about
my
knees
,
perfectly
silent
on
her
part
and
with
the
*NL*
same
peculiar
cooing
sounds
from
the
Morlocks
.
Soft
little
hands
,
*NL*
too
,
were
creeping
over
my
coat
and
back
,
touching
even
my
neck
.
*NL*
Then
the
match
scratched
and
fizzed
.
I
held
it
flaring
,
and
saw
the
*NL*
white
backs
of
the
Morlocks
in
flight
amid
the
trees
.
I
hastily
took
*NL*
a
lump
of
camphor
from
my
pocket
,
and
prepared
to
light
it
as
soon
*NL*
as
the
match
should
wane
.
Then
I
looked
at
Weena
.
She
was
lying
*NL*
clutching
my
feet
and
quite
motionless
,
with
her
face
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
With
a
sudden
fright
I
stooped
to
her
.
She
seemed
scarcely
to
*NL*
breathe
.
I
lit
the
block
of
camphor
and
flung
it
to
the
ground
,
*NL*
and
as
it
split
and
flared
up
and
drove
back
the
Morlocks
and
the
*NL*
shadows
,
I
knelt
down
and
lifted
her
.
The
wood
behind
seemed
full
of
*NL*
the
stir
and
murmur
of
a
great
company
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
seemed
to
have
fainted
.
I
put
her
carefully
upon
my
shoulder
*NL*
and
rose
to
push
on
,
and
then
there
came
a
horrible
realization
.
In
*NL*
manoeuvring
with
my
matches
and
Weena
,
I
had
turned
myself
about
*NL*
several
times
,
and
now
I
had
not
the
faintest
idea
in
what
direction
*NL*
lay
my
path
.
For
all
I
knew
,
I
might
be
facing
back
towards
the
*NL*
Palace
of
Green
Porcelain
.
I
found
myself
in
a
cold
sweat
.
I
had
to
*NL*
think
rapidly
what
to
do
.
I
determined
to
build
a
fire
and
encamp
*NL*
where
we
were
.
I
put
Weena
,
still
motionless
,
down
upon
a
turfy
*NL*
bole
,
and
very
hastily
,
as
my
first
lump
of
camphor
waned
,
I
began
*NL*
collecting
sticks
and
leaves
.
Here
and
there
out
of
the
darkness
*NL*
round
me
the
Morlocks
'
eyes
shone
like
carbuncles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
camphor
flickered
and
went
out
.
I
lit
a
match
,
and
as
I
did
so
,
*NL*
two
white
forms
that
had
been
approaching
Weena
dashed
hastily
away
.
*NL*
One
was
so
blinded
by
the
light
that
he
came
straight
for
me
,
and
I
*NL*
felt
his
bones
grind
under
the
blow
of
my
fist
.
He
gave
a
whoop
of
*NL*
dismay
,
staggered
a
little
way
,
and
fell
down
.
I
lit
another
piece
*NL*
of
camphor
,
and
went
on
gathering
my
bonfire
.
Presently
I
noticed
*NL*
how
dry
was
some
of
the
foliage
above
me
,
for
since
my
arrival
*NL*
on
the
Time
Machine
,
a
matter
of
a
week
,
no
rain
had
fallen
.
So
,
*NL*
instead
of
casting
about
among
the
trees
for
fallen
twigs
,
I
began
*NL*
leaping
up
and
dragging
down
branches
.
Very
soon
I
had
a
choking
*NL*
smoky
fire
of
green
wood
and
dry
sticks
,
and
could
economize
my
*NL*
camphor
.
Then
I
turned
to
where
Weena
lay
beside
my
iron
mace
.
I
*NL*
tried
what
I
could
to
revive
her
,
but
she
lay
like
one
dead
.
I
could
*NL*
not
even
satisfy
myself
whether
or
not
she
breathed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
the
smoke
of
the
fire
beat
over
towards
me
,
and
it
must
have
*NL*
made
me
heavy
of
a
sudden
.
Moreover
,
the
vapour
of
camphor
was
in
*NL*
the
air
.
My
fire
would
not
need
replenishing
for
an
hour
or
so
.
I
*NL*
felt
very
weary
after
my
exertion
,
and
sat
down
.
The
wood
,
too
,
was
*NL*
full
of
a
slumbrous
murmur
that
I
did
not
understand
.
I
seemed
just
*NL*
to
nod
and
open
my
eyes
.
But
all
was
dark
,
and
the
Morlocks
had
*NL*
their
hands
upon
me
.
Flinging
off
their
clinging
fingers
I
hastily
*NL*
felt
in
my
pocket
for
the
match-box
,
and
--
it
had
gone
!
Then
they
*NL*
gripped
and
closed
with
me
again
.
In
a
moment
I
knew
what
had
*NL*
happened
.
I
had
slept
,
and
my
fire
had
gone
out
,
and
the
bitterness
*NL*
of
death
came
over
my
soul
.
The
forest
seemed
full
of
the
smell
of
*NL*
burning
wood
.
I
was
caught
by
the
neck
,
by
the
hair
,
by
the
arms
,
*NL*
and
pulled
down
.
It
was
indescribably
horrible
in
the
darkness
to
*NL*
feel
all
these
soft
creatures
heaped
upon
me
.
I
felt
as
if
I
was
in
*NL*
a
monstrous
spider
's
web
.
I
was
overpowered
,
and
went
down
.
I
felt
*NL*
little
teeth
nipping
at
my
neck
.
I
rolled
over
,
and
as
I
did
so
my
*NL*
hand
came
against
my
iron
lever
.
It
gave
me
strength
.
I
struggled
*NL*
up
,
shaking
the
human
rats
from
me
,
and
,
holding
the
bar
short
,
*NL*
I
thrust
where
I
judged
their
faces
might
be
.
I
could
feel
the
*NL*
succulent
giving
of
flesh
and
bone
under
my
blows
,
and
for
a
moment
*NL*
I
was
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
strange
exultation
that
so
often
seems
to
accompany
hard
*NL*
fighting
came
upon
me
.
I
knew
that
both
I
and
Weena
were
lost
,
but
I
*NL*
determined
to
make
the
Morlocks
pay
for
their
meat
.
I
stood
with
my
*NL*
back
to
a
tree
,
swinging
the
iron
bar
before
me
.
The
whole
wood
was
*NL*
full
of
the
stir
and
cries
of
them
.
A
minute
passed
.
Their
voices
*NL*
seemed
to
rise
to
a
higher
pitch
of
excitement
,
and
their
movements
*NL*
grew
faster
.
Yet
none
came
within
reach
.
I
stood
glaring
at
the
*NL*
blackness
.
Then
suddenly
came
hope
.
What
if
the
Morlocks
were
*NL*
afraid
?
And
close
on
the
heels
of
that
came
a
strange
thing
.
The
*NL*
darkness
seemed
to
grow
luminous
.
Very
dimly
I
began
to
see
the
*NL*
Morlocks
about
me
--
three
battered
at
my
feet
--
and
then
I
recognized
,
*NL*
with
incredulous
surprise
,
that
the
others
were
running
,
in
an
*NL*
incessant
stream
,
as
it
seemed
,
from
behind
me
,
and
away
through
the
*NL*
wood
in
front
.
And
their
backs
seemed
no
longer
white
,
but
reddish
.
*NL*
As
I
stood
agape
,
I
saw
a
little
red
spark
go
drifting
across
a
gap
*NL*
of
starlight
between
the
branches
,
and
vanish
.
And
at
that
I
*NL*
understood
the
smell
of
burning
wood
,
the
slumbrous
murmur
that
was
*NL*
growing
now
into
a
gusty
roar
,
the
red
glow
,
and
the
Morlocks
'
*NL*
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stepping
out
from
behind
my
tree
and
looking
back
,
I
saw
,
through
*NL*
the
black
pillars
of
the
nearer
trees
,
the
flames
of
the
burning
*NL*
forest
.
It
was
my
first
fire
coming
after
me
.
With
that
I
looked
for
*NL*
Weena
,
but
she
was
gone
.
The
hissing
and
crackling
behind
me
,
the
*NL*
explosive
thud
as
each
fresh
tree
burst
into
flame
,
left
little
*NL*
time
for
reflection
.
My
iron
bar
still
gripped
,
I
followed
in
the
*NL*
Morlocks
'
path
.
It
was
a
close
race
.
Once
the
flames
crept
forward
*NL*
so
swiftly
on
my
right
as
I
ran
that
I
was
outflanked
and
had
to
*NL*
strike
off
to
the
left
.
But
at
last
I
emerged
upon
a
small
open
*NL*
space
,
and
as
I
did
so
,
a
Morlock
came
blundering
towards
me
,
and
*NL*
past
me
,
and
went
on
straight
into
the
fire
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
now
I
was
to
see
the
most
weird
and
horrible
thing
,
I
think
,
of
*NL*
all
that
I
beheld
in
that
future
age
.
This
whole
space
was
as
bright
*NL*
as
day
with
the
reflection
of
the
fire
.
In
the
centre
was
a
hillock
*NL*
or
tumulus
,
surmounted
by
a
scorched
hawthorn
.
Beyond
this
was
*NL*
another
arm
of
the
burning
forest
,
with
yellow
tongues
already
*NL*
writhing
from
it
,
completely
encircling
the
space
with
a
fence
of
*NL*
fire
.
Upon
the
hill-side
were
some
thirty
or
forty
Morlocks
,
dazzled
*NL*
by
the
light
and
heat
,
and
blundering
hither
and
thither
against
*NL*
each
other
in
their
bewilderment
.
At
first
I
did
not
realize
their
*NL*
blindness
,
and
struck
furiously
at
them
with
my
bar
,
in
a
frenzy
of
*NL*
fear
,
as
they
approached
me
,
killing
one
and
crippling
several
more
.
*NL*
But
when
I
had
watched
the
gestures
of
one
of
them
groping
under
the
*NL*
hawthorn
against
the
red
sky
,
and
heard
their
moans
,
I
was
assured
*NL*
of
their
absolute
helplessness
and
misery
in
the
glare
,
and
I
struck
*NL*
no
more
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yet
every
now
and
then
one
would
come
straight
towards
me
,
setting
*NL*
loose
a
quivering
horror
that
made
me
quick
to
elude
him
.
At
one
*NL*
time
the
flames
died
down
somewhat
,
and
I
feared
the
foul
creatures
*NL*
would
presently
be
able
to
see
me
.
I
was
thinking
of
beginning
the
*NL*
fight
by
killing
some
of
them
before
this
should
happen
;
but
the
*NL*
fire
burst
out
again
brightly
,
and
I
stayed
my
hand
.
I
walked
about
*NL*
the
hill
among
them
and
avoided
them
,
looking
for
some
trace
of
*NL*
Weena
.
But
Weena
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
last
I
sat
down
on
the
summit
of
the
hillock
,
and
watched
this
*NL*
strange
incredible
company
of
blind
things
groping
to
and
fro
,
and
*NL*
making
uncanny
noises
to
each
other
,
as
the
glare
of
the
fire
beat
*NL*
on
them
.
The
coiling
uprush
of
smoke
streamed
across
the
sky
,
and
*NL*
through
the
rare
tatters
of
that
red
canopy
,
remote
as
though
they
*NL*
belonged
to
another
universe
,
shone
the
little
stars
.
Two
or
three
*NL*
Morlocks
came
blundering
into
me
,
and
I
drove
them
off
with
blows
*NL*
of
my
fists
,
trembling
as
I
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
the
most
part
of
that
night
I
was
persuaded
it
was
a
nightmare
.
*NL*
I
bit
myself
and
screamed
in
a
passionate
desire
to
awake
.
I
beat
*NL*
the
ground
with
my
hands
,
and
got
up
and
sat
down
again
,
and
*NL*
wandered
here
and
there
,
and
again
sat
down
.
Then
I
would
fall
to
*NL*
rubbing
my
eyes
and
calling
upon
God
to
let
me
awake
.
Thrice
I
saw
*NL*
Morlocks
put
their
heads
down
in
a
kind
of
agony
and
rush
into
the
*NL*
flames
.
But
,
at
last
,
above
the
subsiding
red
of
the
fire
,
above
the
*NL*
streaming
masses
of
black
smoke
and
the
whitening
and
blackening
*NL*
tree
stumps
,
and
the
diminishing
numbers
of
these
dim
creatures
,
*NL*
came
the
white
light
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
searched
again
for
traces
of
Weena
,
but
there
were
none
.
It
was
*NL*
plain
that
they
had
left
her
poor
little
body
in
the
forest
.
I
*NL*
can
not
describe
how
it
relieved
me
to
think
that
it
had
escaped
the
*NL*
awful
fate
to
which
it
seemed
destined
.
As
I
thought
of
that
,
I
was
*NL*
almost
moved
to
begin
a
massacre
of
the
helpless
abominations
about
*NL*
me
,
but
I
contained
myself
.
The
hillock
,
as
I
have
said
,
was
a
kind
*NL*
of
island
in
the
forest
.
From
its
summit
I
could
now
make
out
*NL*
through
a
haze
of
smoke
the
Palace
of
Green
Porcelain
,
and
from
that
*NL*
I
could
get
my
bearings
for
the
White
Sphinx
.
And
so
,
leaving
the
*NL*
remnant
of
these
damned
souls
still
going
hither
and
thither
and
*NL*
moaning
,
as
the
day
grew
clearer
,
I
tied
some
grass
about
my
feet
*NL*
and
limped
on
across
smoking
ashes
and
among
black
stems
,
that
still
*NL*
pulsated
internally
with
fire
,
towards
the
hiding-place
of
the
Time
*NL*
Machine
.
I
walked
slowly
,
for
I
was
almost
exhausted
,
as
well
as
*NL*
lame
,
and
I
felt
the
intensest
wretchedness
for
the
horrible
death
*NL*
of
little
Weena
.
It
seemed
an
overwhelming
calamity
.
Now
,
in
this
*NL*
old
familiar
room
,
it
is
more
like
the
sorrow
of
a
dream
than
an
*NL*
actual
loss
.
But
that
morning
it
left
me
absolutely
lonely
*NL*
again
--
terribly
alone
.
I
began
to
think
of
this
house
of
mine
,
of
*NL*
this
fireside
,
of
some
of
you
,
and
with
such
thoughts
came
a
longing
*NL*
that
was
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
as
I
walked
over
the
smoking
ashes
under
the
bright
morning
*NL*
sky
,
I
made
a
discovery
.
In
my
trouser
pocket
were
still
some
loose
*NL*
matches
.
The
box
must
have
leaked
before
it
was
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
X
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
eight
or
nine
in
the
morning
I
came
to
the
same
seat
of
*NL*
yellow
metal
from
which
I
had
viewed
the
world
upon
the
evening
of
*NL*
my
arrival
.
I
thought
of
my
hasty
conclusions
upon
that
evening
and
*NL*
could
not
refrain
from
laughing
bitterly
at
my
confidence
.
Here
*NL*
was
the
same
beautiful
scene
,
the
same
abundant
foliage
,
the
same
*NL*
splendid
palaces
and
magnificent
ruins
,
the
same
silver
river
*NL*
running
between
its
fertile
banks
.
The
gay
robes
of
the
beautiful
*NL*
people
moved
hither
and
thither
among
the
trees
.
Some
were
bathing
*NL*
in
exactly
the
place
where
I
had
saved
Weena
,
and
that
suddenly
gave
*NL*
me
a
keen
stab
of
pain
.
And
like
blots
upon
the
landscape
rose
the
*NL*
cupolas
above
the
ways
to
the
Under-world
.
I
understood
now
what
all
*NL*
the
beauty
of
the
Over-world
people
covered
.
Very
pleasant
was
their
*NL*
day
,
as
pleasant
as
the
day
of
the
cattle
in
the
field
.
Like
the
*NL*
cattle
,
they
knew
of
no
enemies
and
provided
against
no
needs
.
And
*NL*
their
end
was
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
grieved
to
think
how
brief
the
dream
of
the
human
intellect
had
*NL*
been
.
It
had
committed
suicide
.
It
had
set
itself
steadfastly
*NL*
towards
comfort
and
ease
,
a
balanced
society
with
security
and
*NL*
permanency
as
its
watchword
,
it
had
attained
its
hopes
--
to
come
*NL*
to
this
at
last
.
Once
,
life
and
property
must
have
reached
almost
*NL*
absolute
safety
.
The
rich
had
been
assured
of
his
wealth
and
*NL*
comfort
,
the
toiler
assured
of
his
life
and
work
.
No
doubt
in
that
*NL*
perfect
world
there
had
been
no
unemployed
problem
,
no
social
*NL*
question
left
unsolved
.
And
a
great
quiet
had
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
a
law
of
nature
we
overlook
,
that
intellectual
versatility
*NL*
is
the
compensation
for
change
,
danger
,
and
trouble
.
An
animal
*NL*
perfectly
in
harmony
with
its
environment
is
a
perfect
mechanism
.
*NL*
Nature
never
appeals
to
intelligence
until
habit
and
instinct
are
*NL*
useless
.
There
is
no
intelligence
where
there
is
no
change
and
no
*NL*
need
of
change
.
Only
those
animals
partake
of
intelligence
that
have
*NL*
to
meet
a
huge
variety
of
needs
and
dangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
,
as
I
see
it
,
the
Upper-world
man
had
drifted
towards
his
*NL*
feeble
prettiness
,
and
the
Under-world
to
mere
mechanical
industry
.
*NL*
But
that
perfect
state
had
lacked
one
thing
even
for
mechanical
*NL*
perfection
--
absolute
permanency
.
Apparently
as
time
went
on
,
the
*NL*
feeding
of
the
Under-world
,
however
it
was
effected
,
had
become
*NL*
disjointed
.
Mother
Necessity
,
who
had
been
staved
off
for
a
*NL*
few
thousand
years
,
came
back
again
,
and
she
began
below
.
The
*NL*
Under-world
being
in
contact
with
machinery
,
which
,
however
perfect
,
*NL*
still
needs
some
little
thought
outside
habit
,
had
probably
retained
*NL*
perforce
rather
more
initiative
,
if
less
of
every
other
human
*NL*
character
,
than
the
Upper
.
And
when
other
meat
failed
them
,
they
*NL*
turned
to
what
old
habit
had
hitherto
forbidden
.
So
I
say
I
saw
it
*NL*
in
my
last
view
of
the
world
of
Eight
Hundred
and
Two
Thousand
Seven
*NL*
Hundred
and
One
.
It
may
be
as
wrong
an
explanation
as
mortal
wit
*NL*
could
invent
.
It
is
how
the
thing
shaped
itself
to
me
,
and
as
that
I
*NL*
give
it
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
the
fatigues
,
excitements
,
and
terrors
of
the
past
days
,
and
*NL*
in
spite
of
my
grief
,
this
seat
and
the
tranquil
view
and
the
warm
*NL*
sunlight
were
very
pleasant
.
I
was
very
tired
and
sleepy
,
and
soon
*NL*
my
theorizing
passed
into
dozing
.
Catching
myself
at
that
,
I
took
my
*NL*
own
hint
,
and
spreading
myself
out
upon
the
turf
I
had
a
long
and
*NL*
refreshing
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
awoke
a
little
before
sunsetting
.
I
now
felt
safe
against
being
*NL*
caught
napping
by
the
Morlocks
,
and
,
stretching
myself
,
I
came
on
*NL*
down
the
hill
towards
the
White
Sphinx
.
I
had
my
crowbar
in
one
*NL*
hand
,
and
the
other
hand
played
with
the
matches
in
my
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
now
came
a
most
unexpected
thing
.
As
I
approached
the
pedestal
*NL*
of
the
sphinx
I
found
the
bronze
valves
were
open
.
They
had
slid
*NL*
down
into
grooves
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
that
I
stopped
short
before
them
,
hesitating
to
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Within
was
a
small
apartment
,
and
on
a
raised
place
in
the
corner
*NL*
of
this
was
the
Time
Machine
.
I
had
the
small
levers
in
my
pocket
.
*NL*
So
here
,
after
all
my
elaborate
preparations
for
the
siege
of
the
*NL*
White
Sphinx
,
was
a
meek
surrender
.
I
threw
my
iron
bar
away
,
almost
*NL*
sorry
not
to
use
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
sudden
thought
came
into
my
head
as
I
stooped
towards
the
portal
.
*NL*
For
once
,
at
least
,
I
grasped
the
mental
operations
of
the
Morlocks
.
*NL*
Suppressing
a
strong
inclination
to
laugh
,
I
stepped
through
the
*NL*
bronze
frame
and
up
to
the
Time
Machine
.
I
was
surprised
to
find
it
*NL*
had
been
carefully
oiled
and
cleaned
.
I
have
suspected
since
that
*NL*
the
Morlocks
had
even
partially
taken
it
to
pieces
while
trying
in
*NL*
their
dim
way
to
grasp
its
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
as
I
stood
and
examined
it
,
finding
a
pleasure
in
the
mere
*NL*
touch
of
the
contrivance
,
the
thing
I
had
expected
happened
.
The
*NL*
bronze
panels
suddenly
slid
up
and
struck
the
frame
with
a
clang
.
*NL*
I
was
in
the
dark
--
trapped
.
So
the
Morlocks
thought
.
At
that
I
*NL*
chuckled
gleefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
could
already
hear
their
murmuring
laughter
as
they
came
towards
*NL*
me
.
Very
calmly
I
tried
to
strike
the
match
.
I
had
only
to
fix
on
*NL*
the
levers
and
depart
then
like
a
ghost
.
But
I
had
overlooked
one
*NL*
little
thing
.
The
matches
were
of
that
abominable
kind
that
light
*NL*
only
on
the
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
imagine
how
all
my
calm
vanished
.
The
little
brutes
were
*NL*
close
upon
me
.
One
touched
me
.
I
made
a
sweeping
blow
in
the
dark
at
*NL*
them
with
the
levers
,
and
began
to
scramble
into
the
saddle
of
the
*NL*
machine
.
Then
came
one
hand
upon
me
and
then
another
.
Then
I
had
*NL*
simply
to
fight
against
their
persistent
fingers
for
my
levers
,
and
*NL*
at
the
same
time
feel
for
the
studs
over
which
these
fitted
.
One
,
*NL*
indeed
,
they
almost
got
away
from
me
.
As
it
slipped
from
my
hand
,
*NL*
I
had
to
butt
in
the
dark
with
my
head
--
I
could
hear
the
Morlock
's
*NL*
skull
ring
--
to
recover
it
.
It
was
a
nearer
thing
than
the
fight
in
*NL*
the
forest
,
I
think
,
this
last
scramble
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
at
last
the
lever
was
fitted
and
pulled
over
.
The
clinging
*NL*
hands
slipped
from
me
.
The
darkness
presently
fell
from
my
eyes
.
*NL*
I
found
myself
in
the
same
grey
light
and
tumult
I
have
already
*NL*
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
already
told
you
of
the
sickness
and
confusion
that
comes
*NL*
with
time
travelling
.
And
this
time
I
was
not
seated
properly
in
the
*NL*
saddle
,
but
sideways
and
in
an
unstable
fashion
.
For
an
indefinite
*NL*
time
I
clung
to
the
machine
as
it
swayed
and
vibrated
,
quite
*NL*
unheeding
how
I
went
,
and
when
I
brought
myself
to
look
at
the
dials
*NL*
again
I
was
amazed
to
find
where
I
had
arrived
.
One
dial
records
*NL*
days
,
and
another
thousands
of
days
,
another
millions
of
days
,
and
*NL*
another
thousands
of
millions
.
Now
,
instead
of
reversing
the
levers
,
*NL*
I
had
pulled
them
over
so
as
to
go
forward
with
them
,
and
when
I
*NL*
came
to
look
at
these
indicators
I
found
that
the
thousands
hand
was
*NL*
sweeping
round
as
fast
as
the
seconds
hand
of
a
watch
--
into
*NL*
futurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
I
drove
on
,
a
peculiar
change
crept
over
the
appearance
of
*NL*
things
.
The
palpitating
greyness
grew
darker
;
then
--
though
I
was
*NL*
still
travelling
with
prodigious
velocity
--
the
blinking
succession
*NL*
of
day
and
night
,
which
was
usually
indicative
of
a
slower
pace
,
*NL*
returned
,
and
grew
more
and
more
marked
.
This
puzzled
me
very
much
*NL*
at
first
.
The
alternations
of
night
and
day
grew
slower
and
slower
,
*NL*
and
so
did
the
passage
of
the
sun
across
the
sky
,
until
they
seemed
*NL*
to
stretch
through
centuries
.
At
last
a
steady
twilight
brooded
over
*NL*
the
earth
,
a
twilight
only
broken
now
and
then
when
a
comet
glared
*NL*
across
the
darkling
sky
.
The
band
of
light
that
had
indicated
the
*NL*
sun
had
long
since
disappeared
;
for
the
sun
had
ceased
to
set
--
it
*NL*
simply
rose
and
fell
in
the
west
,
and
grew
ever
broader
and
more
*NL*
red
.
All
trace
of
the
moon
had
vanished
.
The
circling
of
the
stars
,
*NL*
growing
slower
and
slower
,
had
given
place
to
creeping
points
of
*NL*
light
.
At
last
,
some
time
before
I
stopped
,
the
sun
,
red
and
very
*NL*
large
,
halted
motionless
upon
the
horizon
,
a
vast
dome
glowing
with
*NL*
a
dull
heat
,
and
now
and
then
suffering
a
momentary
extinction
.
At
*NL*
one
time
it
had
for
a
little
while
glowed
more
brilliantly
again
,
*NL*
but
it
speedily
reverted
to
its
sullen
red
heat
.
I
perceived
by
this
*NL*
slowing
down
of
its
rising
and
setting
that
the
work
of
the
tidal
*NL*
drag
was
done
.
The
earth
had
come
to
rest
with
one
face
to
the
sun
,
*NL*
even
as
in
our
own
time
the
moon
faces
the
earth
.
Very
cautiously
,
*NL*
for
I
remembered
my
former
headlong
fall
,
I
began
to
reverse
*NL*
my
motion
.
Slower
and
slower
went
the
circling
hands
until
the
*NL*
thousands
one
seemed
motionless
and
the
daily
one
was
no
longer
a
*NL*
mere
mist
upon
its
scale
.
Still
slower
,
until
the
dim
outlines
of
a
*NL*
desolate
beach
grew
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
stopped
very
gently
and
sat
upon
the
Time
Machine
,
looking
round
.
*NL*
The
sky
was
no
longer
blue
.
North-eastward
it
was
inky
black
,
*NL*
and
out
of
the
blackness
shone
brightly
and
steadily
the
pale
*NL*
white
stars
.
Overhead
it
was
a
deep
Indian
red
and
starless
,
and
*NL*
south-eastward
it
grew
brighter
to
a
glowing
scarlet
where
,
cut
by
*NL*
the
horizon
,
lay
the
huge
hull
of
the
sun
,
red
and
motionless
.
The
*NL*
rocks
about
me
were
of
a
harsh
reddish
colour
,
and
all
the
trace
of
*NL*
life
that
I
could
see
at
first
was
the
intensely
green
vegetation
*NL*
that
covered
every
projecting
point
on
their
south-eastern
face
.
It
*NL*
was
the
same
rich
green
that
one
sees
on
forest
moss
or
on
the
*NL*
lichen
in
caves
:
plants
which
like
these
grow
in
a
perpetual
*NL*
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
machine
was
standing
on
a
sloping
beach
.
The
sea
stretched
away
*NL*
to
the
south-west
,
to
rise
into
a
sharp
bright
horizon
against
the
*NL*
wan
sky
.
There
were
no
breakers
and
no
waves
,
for
not
a
breath
of
*NL*
wind
was
stirring
.
Only
a
slight
oily
swell
rose
and
fell
like
a
*NL*
gentle
breathing
,
and
showed
that
the
eternal
sea
was
still
moving
*NL*
and
living
.
And
along
the
margin
where
the
water
sometimes
broke
was
*NL*
a
thick
incrustation
of
salt
--
pink
under
the
lurid
sky
.
There
was
a
*NL*
sense
of
oppression
in
my
head
,
and
I
noticed
that
I
was
breathing
*NL*
very
fast
.
The
sensation
reminded
me
of
my
only
experience
of
*NL*
mountaineering
,
and
from
that
I
judged
the
air
to
be
more
rarefied
*NL*
than
it
is
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Far
away
up
the
desolate
slope
I
heard
a
harsh
scream
,
and
saw
a
*NL*
thing
like
a
huge
white
butterfly
go
slanting
and
fluttering
up
into
*NL*
the
sky
and
,
circling
,
disappear
over
some
low
hillocks
beyond
.
The
*NL*
sound
of
its
voice
was
so
dismal
that
I
shivered
and
seated
myself
*NL*
more
firmly
upon
the
machine
.
Looking
round
me
again
,
I
saw
that
,
*NL*
quite
near
,
what
I
had
taken
to
be
a
reddish
mass
of
rock
was
moving
*NL*
slowly
towards
me
.
Then
I
saw
the
thing
was
really
a
monstrous
*NL*
crab-like
creature
.
Can
you
imagine
a
crab
as
large
as
yonder
table
,
*NL*
with
its
many
legs
moving
slowly
and
uncertainly
,
its
big
claws
*NL*
swaying
,
its
long
antennae
,
like
carters
'
whips
,
waving
and
feeling
,
*NL*
and
its
stalked
eyes
gleaming
at
you
on
either
side
of
its
metallic
*NL*
front
?
Its
back
was
corrugated
and
ornamented
with
ungainly
bosses
,
*NL*
and
a
greenish
incrustation
blotched
it
here
and
there
.
I
could
see
*NL*
the
many
palps
of
its
complicated
mouth
flickering
and
feeling
as
it
*NL*
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
I
stared
at
this
sinister
apparition
crawling
towards
me
,
I
felt
*NL*
a
tickling
on
my
cheek
as
though
a
fly
had
lighted
there
.
I
tried
to
*NL*
brush
it
away
with
my
hand
,
but
in
a
moment
it
returned
,
and
almost
*NL*
immediately
came
another
by
my
ear
.
I
struck
at
this
,
and
caught
*NL*
something
threadlike
.
It
was
drawn
swiftly
out
of
my
hand
.
With
a
*NL*
frightful
qualm
,
I
turned
,
and
I
saw
that
I
had
grasped
the
antenna
*NL*
of
another
monster
crab
that
stood
just
behind
me
.
Its
evil
eyes
*NL*
were
wriggling
on
their
stalks
,
its
mouth
was
all
alive
with
*NL*
appetite
,
and
its
vast
ungainly
claws
,
smeared
with
an
algal
slime
,
*NL*
were
descending
upon
me
.
In
a
moment
my
hand
was
on
the
lever
,
and
*NL*
I
had
placed
a
month
between
myself
and
these
monsters
.
But
I
was
*NL*
still
on
the
same
beach
,
and
I
saw
them
distinctly
now
as
soon
as
I
*NL*
stopped
.
Dozens
of
them
seemed
to
be
crawling
here
and
there
,
in
the
*NL*
sombre
light
,
among
the
foliated
sheets
of
intense
green
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
not
convey
the
sense
of
abominable
desolation
that
hung
over
*NL*
the
world
.
The
red
eastern
sky
,
the
northward
blackness
,
the
salt
*NL*
Dead
Sea
,
the
stony
beach
crawling
with
these
foul
,
slow-stirring
*NL*
monsters
,
the
uniform
poisonous-looking
green
of
the
lichenous
*NL*
plants
,
the
thin
air
that
hurts
one
's
lungs
:
all
contributed
to
an
*NL*
appalling
effect
.
I
moved
on
a
hundred
years
,
and
there
was
the
same
*NL*
red
sun
--
a
little
larger
,
a
little
duller
--
the
same
dying
sea
,
the
*NL*
same
chill
air
,
and
the
same
crowd
of
earthy
crustacea
creeping
in
*NL*
and
out
among
the
green
weed
and
the
red
rocks
.
And
in
the
westward
*NL*
sky
,
I
saw
a
curved
pale
line
like
a
vast
new
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
I
travelled
,
stopping
ever
and
again
,
in
great
strides
of
a
*NL*
thousand
years
or
more
,
drawn
on
by
the
mystery
of
the
earth
's
fate
,
*NL*
watching
with
a
strange
fascination
the
sun
grow
larger
and
duller
*NL*
in
the
westward
sky
,
and
the
life
of
the
old
earth
ebb
away
.
At
*NL*
last
,
more
than
thirty
million
years
hence
,
the
huge
red-hot
dome
of
*NL*
the
sun
had
come
to
obscure
nearly
a
tenth
part
of
the
darkling
*NL*
heavens
.
Then
I
stopped
once
more
,
for
the
crawling
multitude
of
*NL*
crabs
had
disappeared
,
and
the
red
beach
,
save
for
its
livid
green
*NL*
liverworts
and
lichens
,
seemed
lifeless
.
And
now
it
was
flecked
with
*NL*
white
.
A
bitter
cold
assailed
me
.
Rare
white
flakes
ever
and
again
*NL*
came
eddying
down
.
To
the
north-eastward
,
the
glare
of
snow
lay
*NL*
under
the
starlight
of
the
sable
sky
and
I
could
see
an
undulating
*NL*
crest
of
hillocks
pinkish
white
.
There
were
fringes
of
ice
along
the
*NL*
sea
margin
,
with
drifting
masses
further
out
;
but
the
main
expanse
*NL*
of
that
salt
ocean
,
all
bloody
under
the
eternal
sunset
,
was
still
*NL*
unfrozen
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
looked
about
me
to
see
if
any
traces
of
animal
life
remained
.
A
*NL*
certain
indefinable
apprehension
still
kept
me
in
the
saddle
of
the
*NL*
machine
.
But
I
saw
nothing
moving
,
in
earth
or
sky
or
sea
.
The
green
*NL*
slime
on
the
rocks
alone
testified
that
life
was
not
extinct
.
A
*NL*
shallow
sandbank
had
appeared
in
the
sea
and
the
water
had
receded
*NL*
from
the
beach
.
I
fancied
I
saw
some
black
object
flopping
about
*NL*
upon
this
bank
,
but
it
became
motionless
as
I
looked
at
it
,
and
I
*NL*
judged
that
my
eye
had
been
deceived
,
and
that
the
black
object
was
*NL*
merely
a
rock
.
The
stars
in
the
sky
were
intensely
bright
and
seemed
*NL*
to
me
to
twinkle
very
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suddenly
I
noticed
that
the
circular
westward
outline
of
the
sun
*NL*
had
changed
;
that
a
concavity
,
a
bay
,
had
appeared
in
the
curve
.
I
*NL*
saw
this
grow
larger
.
For
a
minute
perhaps
I
stared
aghast
at
this
*NL*
blackness
that
was
creeping
over
the
day
,
and
then
I
realized
that
*NL*
an
eclipse
was
beginning
.
Either
the
moon
or
the
planet
Mercury
was
*NL*
passing
across
the
sun
's
disk
.
Naturally
,
at
first
I
took
it
to
be
*NL*
the
moon
,
but
there
is
much
to
incline
me
to
believe
that
what
I
*NL*
really
saw
was
the
transit
of
an
inner
planet
passing
very
near
to
*NL*
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
darkness
grew
apace
;
a
cold
wind
began
to
blow
in
freshening
*NL*
gusts
from
the
east
,
and
the
showering
white
flakes
in
the
air
*NL*
increased
in
number
.
From
the
edge
of
the
sea
came
a
ripple
and
*NL*
whisper
.
Beyond
these
lifeless
sounds
the
world
was
silent
.
Silent
?
*NL*
It
would
be
hard
to
convey
the
stillness
of
it
.
All
the
sounds
of
*NL*
man
,
the
bleating
of
sheep
,
the
cries
of
birds
,
the
hum
of
insects
,
*NL*
the
stir
that
makes
the
background
of
our
lives
--
all
that
was
over
.
*NL*
As
the
darkness
thickened
,
the
eddying
flakes
grew
more
abundant
,
*NL*
dancing
before
my
eyes
;
and
the
cold
of
the
air
more
intense
.
At
*NL*
last
,
one
by
one
,
swiftly
,
one
after
the
other
,
the
white
peaks
of
*NL*
the
distant
hills
vanished
into
blackness
.
The
breeze
rose
to
a
*NL*
moaning
wind
.
I
saw
the
black
central
shadow
of
the
eclipse
sweeping
*NL*
towards
me
.
In
another
moment
the
pale
stars
alone
were
visible
.
All
*NL*
else
was
rayless
obscurity
.
The
sky
was
absolutely
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
horror
of
this
great
darkness
came
on
me
.
The
cold
,
that
smote
*NL*
to
my
marrow
,
and
the
pain
I
felt
in
breathing
,
overcame
me
.
I
*NL*
shivered
,
and
a
deadly
nausea
seized
me
.
Then
like
a
red-hot
bow
*NL*
in
the
sky
appeared
the
edge
of
the
sun
.
I
got
off
the
machine
to
*NL*
recover
myself
.
I
felt
giddy
and
incapable
of
facing
the
return
*NL*
journey
.
As
I
stood
sick
and
confused
I
saw
again
the
moving
thing
*NL*
upon
the
shoal
--
there
was
no
mistake
now
that
it
was
a
moving
*NL*
thing
--
against
the
red
water
of
the
sea
.
It
was
a
round
thing
,
the
*NL*
size
of
a
football
perhaps
,
or
,
it
may
be
,
bigger
,
and
tentacles
*NL*
trailed
down
from
it
;
it
seemed
black
against
the
weltering
*NL*
blood-red
water
,
and
it
was
hopping
fitfully
about
.
Then
I
felt
I
*NL*
was
fainting
.
But
a
terrible
dread
of
lying
helpless
in
that
remote
*NL*
and
awful
twilight
sustained
me
while
I
clambered
upon
the
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
I
came
back
.
For
a
long
time
I
must
have
been
insensible
upon
*NL*
the
machine
.
The
blinking
succession
of
the
days
and
nights
was
*NL*
resumed
,
the
sun
got
golden
again
,
the
sky
blue
.
I
breathed
with
*NL*
greater
freedom
.
The
fluctuating
contours
of
the
land
ebbed
and
*NL*
flowed
.
The
hands
spun
backward
upon
the
dials
.
At
last
I
saw
again
*NL*
the
dim
shadows
of
houses
,
the
evidences
of
decadent
humanity
.
*NL*
These
,
too
,
changed
and
passed
,
and
others
came
.
Presently
,
when
the
*NL*
million
dial
was
at
zero
,
I
slackened
speed
.
I
began
to
recognize
*NL*
our
own
pretty
and
familiar
architecture
,
the
thousands
hand
ran
back
*NL*
to
the
starting-point
,
the
night
and
day
flapped
slower
and
slower
.
*NL*
Then
the
old
walls
of
the
laboratory
came
round
me
.
Very
gently
,
*NL*
now
,
I
slowed
the
mechanism
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
saw
one
little
thing
that
seemed
odd
to
me
.
I
think
I
have
told
*NL*
you
that
when
I
set
out
,
before
my
velocity
became
very
high
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Watchett
had
walked
across
the
room
,
travelling
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
*NL*
like
a
rocket
.
As
I
returned
,
I
passed
again
across
that
minute
when
*NL*
she
traversed
the
laboratory
.
But
now
her
every
motion
appeared
to
*NL*
be
the
exact
inversion
of
her
previous
ones
.
The
door
at
the
lower
*NL*
end
opened
,
and
she
glided
quietly
up
the
laboratory
,
back
foremost
,
*NL*
and
disappeared
behind
the
door
by
which
she
had
previously
entered
.
*NL*
Just
before
that
I
seemed
to
see
Hillyer
for
a
moment
;
but
he
passed
*NL*
like
a
flash
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
I
stopped
the
machine
,
and
saw
about
me
again
the
old
familiar
*NL*
laboratory
,
my
tools
,
my
appliances
just
as
I
had
left
them
.
I
got
*NL*
off
the
thing
very
shakily
,
and
sat
down
upon
my
bench
.
For
several
*NL*
minutes
I
trembled
violently
.
Then
I
became
calmer
.
Around
me
was
*NL*
my
old
workshop
again
,
exactly
as
it
had
been
.
I
might
have
slept
*NL*
there
,
and
the
whole
thing
have
been
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
yet
,
not
exactly
!
The
thing
had
started
from
the
south-east
*NL*
corner
of
the
laboratory
.
It
had
come
to
rest
again
in
the
*NL*
north-west
,
against
the
wall
where
you
saw
it
.
That
gives
you
the
*NL*
exact
distance
from
my
little
lawn
to
the
pedestal
of
the
White
*NL*
Sphinx
,
into
which
the
Morlocks
had
carried
my
machine
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
a
time
my
brain
went
stagnant
.
Presently
I
got
up
and
came
*NL*
through
the
passage
here
,
limping
,
because
my
heel
was
still
*NL*
painful
,
and
feeling
sorely
begrimed
.
I
saw
the
_
Pall
Mall
Gazette
_
*NL*
on
the
table
by
the
door
.
I
found
the
date
was
indeed
to-day
,
and
*NL*
looking
at
the
timepiece
,
saw
the
hour
was
almost
eight
o'clock
.
I
*NL*
heard
your
voices
and
the
clatter
of
plates
.
I
hesitated
--
I
felt
so
*NL*
sick
and
weak
.
Then
I
sniffed
good
wholesome
meat
,
and
opened
the
*NL*
door
on
you
.
You
know
the
rest
.
I
washed
,
and
dined
,
and
now
I
am
*NL*
telling
you
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
,
'
he
said
,
after
a
pause
,
`
that
all
this
will
be
absolutely
*NL*
incredible
to
you
.
To
me
the
one
incredible
thing
is
that
I
am
here
*NL*
to-night
in
this
old
familiar
room
looking
into
your
friendly
faces
*NL*
and
telling
you
these
strange
adventures
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
Medical
Man
.
`
No
.
I
can
not
expect
you
to
believe
*NL*
it
.
Take
it
as
a
lie
--
or
a
prophecy
.
Say
I
dreamed
it
in
the
*NL*
workshop
.
Consider
I
have
been
speculating
upon
the
destinies
of
our
*NL*
race
until
I
have
hatched
this
fiction
.
Treat
my
assertion
of
its
*NL*
truth
as
a
mere
stroke
of
art
to
enhance
its
interest
.
And
taking
*NL*
it
as
a
story
,
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
his
pipe
,
and
began
,
in
his
old
accustomed
manner
,
to
tap
*NL*
with
it
nervously
upon
the
bars
of
the
grate
.
There
was
a
momentary
*NL*
stillness
.
Then
chairs
began
to
creak
and
shoes
to
scrape
upon
the
*NL*
carpet
.
I
took
my
eyes
off
the
Time
Traveller
's
face
,
and
looked
*NL*
round
at
his
audience
.
They
were
in
the
dark
,
and
little
spots
of
*NL*
colour
swam
before
them
.
The
Medical
Man
seemed
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
contemplation
of
our
host
.
The
Editor
was
looking
hard
at
the
end
*NL*
of
his
cigar
--
the
sixth
.
The
Journalist
fumbled
for
his
watch
.
The
*NL*
others
,
as
far
as
I
remember
,
were
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Editor
stood
up
with
a
sigh
.
`
What
a
pity
it
is
you
're
not
*NL*
a
writer
of
stories
!
'
he
said
,
putting
his
hand
on
the
Time
*NL*
Traveller
's
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
do
n't
believe
it
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
thought
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
turned
to
us
.
`
Where
are
the
matches
?
'
he
said
.
*NL*
He
lit
one
and
spoke
over
his
pipe
,
puffing
.
`
To
tell
you
the
truth
*NL*
...
I
hardly
believe
it
myself
...
And
yet
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
His
eye
fell
with
a
mute
inquiry
upon
the
withered
white
flowers
*NL*
upon
the
little
table
.
Then
he
turned
over
the
hand
holding
his
*NL*
pipe
,
and
I
saw
he
was
looking
at
some
half-healed
scars
on
his
*NL*
knuckles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Medical
Man
rose
,
came
to
the
lamp
,
and
examined
the
flowers
.
*NL*
`
The
gynaeceum
's
odd
,
'
he
said
.
The
Psychologist
leant
forward
to
*NL*
see
,
holding
out
his
hand
for
a
specimen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
I
'm
hanged
if
it
is
n't
a
quarter
to
one
,
'
said
the
Journalist
.
*NL*
`
How
shall
we
get
home
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Plenty
of
cabs
at
the
station
,
'
said
the
Psychologist
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
's
a
curious
thing
,
'
said
the
Medical
Man
;
`
but
I
certainly
do
n't
*NL*
know
the
natural
order
of
these
flowers
.
May
I
have
them
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
hesitated
.
Then
suddenly
:
`
Certainly
not
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where
did
you
really
get
them
?
'
said
the
Medical
Man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
put
his
hand
to
his
head
.
He
spoke
like
one
who
*NL*
was
trying
to
keep
hold
of
an
idea
that
eluded
him
.
`
They
were
put
*NL*
into
my
pocket
by
Weena
,
when
I
travelled
into
Time
.
'
He
stared
*NL*
round
the
room
.
`
I
'm
damned
if
it
is
n't
all
going
.
This
room
and
you
*NL*
and
the
atmosphere
of
every
day
is
too
much
for
my
memory
.
Did
I
*NL*
ever
make
a
Time
Machine
,
or
a
model
of
a
Time
Machine
?
Or
is
it
all
*NL*
only
a
dream
?
They
say
life
is
a
dream
,
a
precious
poor
dream
at
*NL*
times
--
but
I
ca
n't
stand
another
that
wo
n't
fit
.
It
's
madness
.
And
*NL*
where
did
the
dream
come
from
?
...
I
must
look
at
that
machine
.
If
*NL*
there
is
one
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
caught
up
the
lamp
swiftly
,
and
carried
it
,
flaring
red
,
through
*NL*
the
door
into
the
corridor
.
We
followed
him
.
There
in
the
flickering
*NL*
light
of
the
lamp
was
the
machine
sure
enough
,
squat
,
ugly
,
and
*NL*
askew
;
a
thing
of
brass
,
ebony
,
ivory
,
and
translucent
glimmering
*NL*
quartz
.
Solid
to
the
touch
--
for
I
put
out
my
hand
and
felt
the
rail
*NL*
of
it
--
and
with
brown
spots
and
smears
upon
the
ivory
,
and
bits
of
*NL*
grass
and
moss
upon
the
lower
parts
,
and
one
rail
bent
awry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Time
Traveller
put
the
lamp
down
on
the
bench
,
and
ran
his
hand
*NL*
along
the
damaged
rail
.
`
It
's
all
right
now
,
'
he
said
.
`
The
story
I
*NL*
told
you
was
true
.
I
'm
sorry
to
have
brought
you
out
here
in
the
*NL*
cold
.
'
He
took
up
the
lamp
,
and
,
in
an
absolute
silence
,
we
*NL*
returned
to
the
smoking-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
into
the
hall
with
us
and
helped
the
Editor
on
with
his
*NL*
coat
.
The
Medical
Man
looked
into
his
face
and
,
with
a
certain
*NL*
hesitation
,
told
him
he
was
suffering
from
overwork
,
at
which
he
*NL*
laughed
hugely
.
I
remember
him
standing
in
the
open
doorway
,
bawling
*NL*
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shared
a
cab
with
the
Editor
.
He
thought
the
tale
a
`
gaudy
lie
.
'
*NL*
For
my
own
part
I
was
unable
to
come
to
a
conclusion
.
The
story
was
*NL*
so
fantastic
and
incredible
,
the
telling
so
credible
and
sober
.
I
*NL*
lay
awake
most
of
the
night
thinking
about
it
.
I
determined
to
go
*NL*
next
day
and
see
the
Time
Traveller
again
.
I
was
told
he
was
in
the
*NL*
laboratory
,
and
being
on
easy
terms
in
the
house
,
I
went
up
to
him
.
*NL*
The
laboratory
,
however
,
was
empty
.
I
stared
for
a
minute
at
the
*NL*
Time
Machine
and
put
out
my
hand
and
touched
the
lever
.
At
that
the
*NL*
squat
substantial-looking
mass
swayed
like
a
bough
shaken
by
the
*NL*
wind
.
Its
instability
startled
me
extremely
,
and
I
had
a
queer
*NL*
reminiscence
of
the
childish
days
when
I
used
to
be
forbidden
to
*NL*
meddle
.
I
came
back
through
the
corridor
.
The
Time
Traveller
met
me
*NL*
in
the
smoking-room
.
He
was
coming
from
the
house
.
He
had
a
small
*NL*
camera
under
one
arm
and
a
knapsack
under
the
other
.
He
laughed
when
*NL*
he
saw
me
,
and
gave
me
an
elbow
to
shake
.
`
I
'm
frightfully
busy
,
'
*NL*
said
he
,
`
with
that
thing
in
there
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
is
it
not
some
hoax
?
'
I
said
.
`
Do
you
really
travel
through
*NL*
time
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Really
and
truly
I
do
.
'
And
he
looked
frankly
into
my
eyes
.
He
*NL*
hesitated
.
His
eye
wandered
about
the
room
.
'
I
only
want
half
an
*NL*
hour
,
'
he
said
.
'
I
know
why
you
came
,
and
it
's
awfully
good
of
you
.
*NL*
There
's
some
magazines
here
.
If
you
'll
stop
to
lunch
I
'll
prove
you
*NL*
this
time
travelling
up
to
the
hilt
,
specimen
and
all
.
If
you
'll
*NL*
forgive
my
leaving
you
now
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
consented
,
hardly
comprehending
then
the
full
import
of
his
words
,
*NL*
and
he
nodded
and
went
on
down
the
corridor
.
I
heard
the
door
of
*NL*
the
laboratory
slam
,
seated
myself
in
a
chair
,
and
took
up
a
daily
*NL*
paper
.
What
was
he
going
to
do
before
lunch-time
?
Then
suddenly
*NL*
I
was
reminded
by
an
advertisement
that
I
had
promised
to
meet
*NL*
Richardson
,
the
publisher
,
at
two
.
I
looked
at
my
watch
,
and
saw
*NL*
that
I
could
barely
save
that
engagement
.
I
got
up
and
went
down
the
*NL*
passage
to
tell
the
Time
Traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
took
hold
of
the
handle
of
the
door
I
heard
an
exclamation
,
*NL*
oddly
truncated
at
the
end
,
and
a
click
and
a
thud
.
A
gust
of
air
*NL*
whirled
round
me
as
I
opened
the
door
,
and
from
within
came
the
*NL*
sound
of
broken
glass
falling
on
the
floor
.
The
Time
Traveller
was
*NL*
not
there
.
I
seemed
to
see
a
ghostly
,
indistinct
figure
sitting
in
*NL*
a
whirling
mass
of
black
and
brass
for
a
moment
--
a
figure
so
*NL*
transparent
that
the
bench
behind
with
its
sheets
of
drawings
was
*NL*
absolutely
distinct
;
but
this
phantasm
vanished
as
I
rubbed
my
eyes
.
*NL*
The
Time
Machine
had
gone
.
Save
for
a
subsiding
stir
of
dust
,
the
*NL*
further
end
of
the
laboratory
was
empty
.
A
pane
of
the
skylight
had
,
*NL*
apparently
,
just
been
blown
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
an
unreasonable
amazement
.
I
knew
that
something
strange
had
*NL*
happened
,
and
for
the
moment
could
not
distinguish
what
the
strange
*NL*
thing
might
be
.
As
I
stood
staring
,
the
door
into
the
garden
opened
,
*NL*
and
the
man-servant
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
at
each
other
.
Then
ideas
began
to
come
.
`
Has
Mr.
--
*NL*
gone
out
that
way
?
'
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
sir
.
No
one
has
come
out
this
way
.
I
was
expecting
to
find
him
*NL*
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
I
understood
.
At
the
risk
of
disappointing
Richardson
I
*NL*
stayed
on
,
waiting
for
the
Time
Traveller
;
waiting
for
the
second
,
*NL*
perhaps
still
stranger
story
,
and
the
specimens
and
photographs
he
*NL*
would
bring
with
him
.
But
I
am
beginning
now
to
fear
that
I
must
*NL*
wait
a
lifetime
.
The
Time
Traveller
vanished
three
years
ago
.
And
,
*NL*
as
everybody
knows
now
,
he
has
never
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
EPILOGUE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
can
not
choose
but
wonder
.
Will
he
ever
return
?
It
may
be
that
he
*NL*
swept
back
into
the
past
,
and
fell
among
the
blood-drinking
,
hairy
*NL*
savages
of
the
Age
of
Unpolished
Stone
;
into
the
abysses
of
the
*NL*
Cretaceous
Sea
;
or
among
the
grotesque
saurians
,
the
huge
reptilian
*NL*
brutes
of
the
Jurassic
times
.
He
may
even
now
--
if
I
may
use
the
*NL*
phrase
--
be
wandering
on
some
plesiosaurus-haunted
Oolitic
coral
*NL*
reef
,
or
beside
the
lonely
saline
lakes
of
the
Triassic
Age
.
Or
did
*NL*
he
go
forward
,
into
one
of
the
nearer
ages
,
in
which
men
are
still
*NL*
men
,
but
with
the
riddles
of
our
own
time
answered
and
its
wearisome
*NL*
problems
solved
?
Into
the
manhood
of
the
race
:
for
I
,
for
my
own
*NL*
part
,
can
not
think
that
these
latter
days
of
weak
experiment
,
*NL*
fragmentary
theory
,
and
mutual
discord
are
indeed
man
's
culminating
*NL*
time
!
I
say
,
for
my
own
part
.
He
,
I
know
--
for
the
question
had
been
*NL*
discussed
among
us
long
before
the
Time
Machine
was
made
--
thought
*NL*
but
cheerlessly
of
the
Advancement
of
Mankind
,
and
saw
in
the
*NL*
growing
pile
of
civilization
only
a
foolish
heaping
that
must
*NL*
inevitably
fall
back
upon
and
destroy
its
makers
in
the
end
.
If
that
*NL*
is
so
,
it
remains
for
us
to
live
as
though
it
were
not
so
.
But
to
me
*NL*
the
future
is
still
black
and
blank
--
is
a
vast
ignorance
,
lit
at
a
*NL*
few
casual
places
by
the
memory
of
his
story
.
And
I
have
by
me
,
for
*NL*
my
comfort
,
two
strange
white
flowers
--
shrivelled
now
,
and
brown
and
*NL*
flat
and
brittle
--
to
witness
that
even
when
mind
and
strength
had
*NL*
gone
,
gratitude
and
a
mutual
tenderness
still
lived
on
