have
asked
leave
to
*NL*
prefix
your
name
to
this
dedication
,
I
must
still
insist
on
my
right
*NL*
to
desire
your
protection
of
this
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
you
,
Sir
,
it
is
owing
that
this
history
was
ever
begun
.
It
was
by
*NL*
your
desire
that
I
first
thought
of
such
a
composition
.
So
many
years
*NL*
have
since
past
,
that
you
may
have
,
perhaps
,
forgotten
this
*NL*
circumstance
:
but
your
desires
are
to
me
in
the
nature
of
commands
;
*NL*
and
the
impression
of
them
is
never
to
be
erased
from
my
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
Sir
,
without
your
assistance
this
history
had
never
been
*NL*
completed
.
Be
not
startled
at
the
assertion
.
I
do
not
intend
to
draw
*NL*
on
you
the
suspicion
of
being
a
romance
writer
.
I
mean
no
more
than
*NL*
that
I
partly
owe
to
you
my
existence
during
great
part
of
the
time
*NL*
which
I
have
employed
in
composing
it
:
another
matter
which
it
may
be
*NL*
necessary
to
remind
you
of
;
since
there
are
certain
actions
of
which
*NL*
you
are
apt
to
be
extremely
forgetful
;
but
of
these
I
hope
I
shall
*NL*
always
have
a
better
memory
than
yourself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lastly
,
It
is
owing
to
you
that
the
history
appears
what
it
now
is
.
If
*NL*
there
be
in
this
work
,
as
some
have
been
pleased
to
say
,
a
stronger
*NL*
picture
of
a
truly
benevolent
mind
than
is
to
be
found
in
any
other
,
*NL*
who
that
knows
you
,
and
a
particular
acquaintance
of
yours
,
will
doubt
*NL*
whence
that
benevolence
hath
been
copied
?
The
world
will
not
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
make
me
the
compliment
of
thinking
I
took
it
from
myself
.
I
*NL*
care
not
:
this
they
shall
own
,
that
the
two
persons
from
whom
I
have
*NL*
taken
it
,
that
is
to
say
,
two
of
the
best
and
worthiest
men
in
the
*NL*
world
,
are
strongly
and
zealously
my
friends
.
I
might
be
contented
*NL*
with
this
,
and
yet
my
vanity
will
add
a
third
to
the
number
;
and
him
*NL*
one
of
the
greatest
and
noblest
,
not
only
in
his
rank
,
but
in
every
*NL*
public
and
private
virtue
.
But
here
,
whilst
my
gratitude
for
the
*NL*
princely
benefactions
of
the
Duke
of
Bedford
bursts
from
my
heart
,
you
*NL*
must
forgive
my
reminding
you
that
it
was
you
who
first
recommended
me
*NL*
to
the
notice
of
my
benefactor
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
are
your
objections
to
the
allowance
of
the
honour
which
I
*NL*
have
sollicited
?
Why
,
you
have
commended
the
book
so
warmly
,
that
you
*NL*
should
be
ashamed
of
reading
your
name
before
the
dedication
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
sir
,
if
the
book
itself
doth
not
make
you
ashamed
of
your
*NL*
commendations
,
nothing
that
I
can
here
write
will
,
or
ought
.
I
am
not
*NL*
to
give
up
my
right
to
your
protection
and
patronage
,
because
you
have
*NL*
commended
my
book
:
for
though
I
acknowledge
so
many
obligations
to
*NL*
you
,
I
do
not
add
this
to
the
number
;
in
which
friendship
,
I
am
*NL*
convinced
,
hath
so
little
share
:
since
that
can
neither
biass
your
*NL*
judgment
,
nor
pervert
your
integrity
.
An
enemy
may
at
any
time
obtain
*NL*
your
commendation
by
only
deserving
it
;
and
the
utmost
which
the
*NL*
faults
of
your
friends
can
hope
for
,
is
your
silence
;
or
,
perhaps
,
if
*NL*
too
severely
accused
,
your
gentle
palliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
sir
,
I
suspect
,
that
your
dislike
of
public
praise
is
your
*NL*
true
objection
to
granting
my
request
.
I
have
observed
that
you
have
,
*NL*
in
common
with
my
two
other
friends
,
an
unwillingness
to
hear
the
*NL*
least
mention
of
your
own
virtues
;
that
,
as
a
great
poet
says
of
one
*NL*
of
you
,
-LRB-
he
might
justly
have
said
it
of
all
three
-RRB-
,
you
*NL*
*NL*
_
Do
good
by
stealth
,
and
blush
to
find
it
fame
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
men
of
this
disposition
are
as
careful
to
shun
applause
,
as
others
*NL*
are
to
escape
censure
,
how
just
must
be
your
apprehension
of
your
*NL*
character
falling
into
my
hands
;
since
what
would
not
a
man
have
*NL*
reason
to
dread
,
if
attacked
by
an
author
who
had
received
from
him
*NL*
injuries
equal
to
my
obligations
to
you
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
will
not
this
dread
of
censure
increase
in
proportion
to
the
*NL*
matter
which
a
man
is
conscious
of
having
afforded
for
it
?
If
his
*NL*
whole
life
,
for
instance
,
should
have
been
one
continued
subject
of
*NL*
satire
,
he
may
well
tremble
when
an
incensed
satirist
takes
him
in
*NL*
hand
.
Now
,
sir
,
if
we
apply
this
to
your
modest
aversion
to
panegyric
,
*NL*
how
reasonable
will
your
fears
of
me
appear
!
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
surely
you
might
have
gratified
my
ambition
,
from
this
single
*NL*
confidence
,
that
I
shall
always
prefer
the
indulgence
of
your
*NL*
inclinations
to
the
satisfaction
of
my
own
.
A
very
strong
instance
of
*NL*
which
I
shall
give
you
in
this
address
,
in
which
I
am
determined
to
*NL*
follow
the
example
of
all
other
dedicators
,
and
will
consider
not
what
*NL*
my
patron
really
deserves
to
have
written
,
but
what
he
will
be
best
*NL*
pleased
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
further
preface
then
,
I
here
present
you
with
the
labours
of
*NL*
some
years
of
my
life
.
What
merit
these
labours
have
is
already
known
*NL*
to
yourself
.
If
,
from
your
favourable
judgment
,
I
have
conceived
some
*NL*
esteem
for
them
,
it
can
not
be
imputed
to
vanity
;
since
I
should
have
*NL*
agreed
as
implicitly
to
your
opinion
,
had
it
been
given
in
favour
of
*NL*
any
other
man
's
production
.
Negatively
,
at
least
,
I
may
be
allowed
to
*NL*
say
,
that
had
I
been
sensible
of
any
great
demerit
in
the
work
,
you
*NL*
are
the
last
person
to
whose
protection
I
would
have
ventured
to
*NL*
recommend
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
name
of
my
patron
,
indeed
,
I
hope
my
reader
will
be
*NL*
convinced
,
at
his
very
entrance
on
this
work
,
that
he
will
find
in
the
*NL*
whole
course
of
it
nothing
prejudicial
to
the
cause
of
religion
and
*NL*
virtue
,
nothing
inconsistent
with
the
strictest
rules
of
decency
,
nor
*NL*
which
can
offend
even
the
chastest
eye
in
the
perusal
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
I
declare
,
that
to
recommend
goodness
and
innocence
hath
*NL*
been
my
sincere
endeavour
in
this
history
.
This
honest
purpose
you
*NL*
have
been
pleased
to
think
I
have
attained
:
and
to
say
the
truth
,
it
*NL*
is
likeliest
to
be
attained
in
books
of
this
kind
;
for
an
example
is
a
*NL*
kind
of
picture
,
in
which
virtue
becomes
,
as
it
were
,
an
object
of
*NL*
sight
,
and
strikes
us
with
an
idea
of
that
loveliness
,
which
Plato
*NL*
asserts
there
is
in
her
naked
charms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
displaying
that
beauty
of
virtue
which
may
attract
the
*NL*
admiration
of
mankind
,
I
have
attempted
to
engage
a
stronger
motive
to
*NL*
human
action
in
her
favour
,
by
convincing
men
,
that
their
true
*NL*
interest
directs
them
to
a
pursuit
of
her
.
For
this
purpose
I
have
*NL*
shown
that
no
acquisitions
of
guilt
can
compensate
the
loss
of
that
*NL*
solid
inward
comfort
of
mind
,
which
is
the
sure
companion
of
innocence
*NL*
and
virtue
;
nor
can
in
the
least
balance
the
evil
of
that
horror
and
*NL*
anxiety
which
,
in
their
room
,
guilt
introduces
into
our
bosoms
.
And
*NL*
again
,
that
as
these
acquisitions
are
in
themselves
generally
*NL*
worthless
,
so
are
the
means
to
attain
them
not
only
base
and
infamous
,
*NL*
but
at
best
incertain
,
and
always
full
of
danger
.
Lastly
,
I
have
*NL*
endeavoured
strongly
to
inculcate
,
that
virtue
and
innocence
can
*NL*
scarce
ever
be
injured
but
by
indiscretion
;
and
that
it
is
this
alone
*NL*
which
often
betrays
them
into
the
snares
that
deceit
and
villainy
*NL*
spread
for
them
.
A
moral
which
I
have
the
more
industriously
laboured
,
*NL*
as
the
teaching
it
is
,
of
all
others
,
the
likeliest
to
be
attended
*NL*
with
success
;
since
,
I
believe
,
it
is
much
easier
to
make
good
men
*NL*
wise
,
than
to
make
bad
men
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
these
purposes
I
have
employed
all
the
wit
and
humour
of
which
I
*NL*
am
master
in
the
following
history
;
wherein
I
have
endeavoured
to
*NL*
laugh
mankind
out
of
their
favourite
follies
and
vices
.
How
far
I
have
*NL*
succeeded
in
this
good
attempt
,
I
shall
submit
to
the
candid
reader
,
*NL*
with
only
two
requests
:
First
,
that
he
will
not
expect
to
find
*NL*
perfection
in
this
work
;
and
Secondly
,
that
he
will
excuse
some
parts
*NL*
of
it
,
if
they
fall
short
of
that
little
merit
which
I
hope
may
appear
*NL*
in
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
detain
you
,
sir
,
no
longer
.
Indeed
I
have
run
into
a
preface
,
*NL*
while
I
professed
to
write
a
dedication
.
But
how
can
it
be
otherwise
?
*NL*
I
dare
not
praise
you
;
and
the
only
means
I
know
of
to
avoid
it
,
when
*NL*
you
are
in
my
thoughts
,
are
either
to
be
entirely
silent
,
or
to
turn
*NL*
my
thoughts
to
some
other
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pardon
,
therefore
,
what
I
have
said
in
this
epistle
,
not
only
without
*NL*
your
consent
,
but
absolutely
against
it
;
and
give
me
at
least
leave
,
*NL*
in
this
public
manner
,
to
declare
that
I
am
,
with
the
highest
respect
*NL*
and
gratitude
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
,
*NL*
*NL*
Your
most
obliged
,
*NL*
*NL*
Obedient
,
humble
servant

*NL*
*NL*
CONTAINING
AS
MUCH
OF
THE
BIRTH
OF
THE
FOUNDLING
AS
IS
NECESSARY
OR
*NL*
PROPER
TO
ACQUAINT
THE
READER
WITH
IN
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THIS
HISTORY
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
introduction
to
the
work
,
or
bill
of
fare
to
the
feast
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
An
author
ought
to
consider
himself
,
not
as
a
gentleman
who
gives
a
*NL*
private
or
eleemosynary
treat
,
but
rather
as
one
who
keeps
a
public
*NL*
ordinary
,
at
which
all
persons
are
welcome
for
their
money
.
In
the
*NL*
former
case
,
it
is
well
known
that
the
entertainer
provides
what
fare
*NL*
he
pleases
;
and
though
this
should
be
very
indifferent
,
and
utterly
*NL*
disagreeable
to
the
taste
of
his
company
,
they
must
not
find
any
*NL*
fault
;
nay
,
on
the
contrary
,
good
breeding
forces
them
outwardly
to
*NL*
approve
and
to
commend
whatever
is
set
before
them
.
Now
the
contrary
*NL*
of
this
happens
to
the
master
of
an
ordinary
.
Men
who
pay
for
what
*NL*
they
eat
will
insist
on
gratifying
their
palates
,
however
nice
and
*NL*
whimsical
these
may
prove
;
and
if
everything
is
not
agreeable
to
their
*NL*
taste
,
will
challenge
a
right
to
censure
,
to
abuse
,
and
to
d
--
n
their
*NL*
dinner
without
controul
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
prevent
,
therefore
,
giving
offence
to
their
customers
by
any
such
*NL*
disappointment
,
it
hath
been
usual
with
the
honest
and
well-meaning
*NL*
host
to
provide
a
bill
of
fare
which
all
persons
may
peruse
at
their
*NL*
first
entrance
into
the
house
;
and
having
thence
acquainted
themselves
*NL*
with
the
entertainment
which
they
may
expect
,
may
either
stay
and
*NL*
regale
with
what
is
provided
for
them
,
or
may
depart
to
some
other
*NL*
ordinary
better
accommodated
to
their
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
do
not
disdain
to
borrow
wit
or
wisdom
from
any
man
who
is
*NL*
capable
of
lending
us
either
,
we
have
condescended
to
take
a
hint
from
*NL*
these
honest
victuallers
,
and
shall
prefix
not
only
a
general
bill
of
*NL*
fare
to
our
whole
entertainment
,
but
shall
likewise
give
the
reader
*NL*
particular
bills
to
every
course
which
is
to
be
served
up
in
this
and
*NL*
the
ensuing
volumes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
provision
,
then
,
which
we
have
here
made
is
no
other
than
_
Human
*NL*
Nature
_
.
Nor
do
I
fear
that
my
sensible
reader
,
though
most
luxurious
*NL*
in
his
taste
,
will
start
,
cavil
,
or
be
offended
,
because
I
have
named
*NL*
but
one
article
.
The
tortoise
--
as
the
alderman
of
Bristol
,
well
*NL*
learned
in
eating
,
knows
by
much
experience
--
besides
the
delicious
*NL*
calipash
and
calipee
,
contains
many
different
kinds
of
food
;
nor
can
*NL*
the
learned
reader
be
ignorant
,
that
in
human
nature
,
though
here
*NL*
collected
under
one
general
name
,
is
such
prodigious
variety
,
that
a
*NL*
cook
will
have
sooner
gone
through
all
the
several
species
of
animal
*NL*
and
vegetable
food
in
the
world
,
than
an
author
will
be
able
to
*NL*
exhaust
so
extensive
a
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
objection
may
perhaps
be
apprehended
from
the
more
delicate
,
that
*NL*
this
dish
is
too
common
and
vulgar
;
for
what
else
is
the
subject
of
*NL*
all
the
romances
,
novels
,
plays
,
and
poems
,
with
which
the
stalls
*NL*
abound
?
Many
exquisite
viands
might
be
rejected
by
the
epicure
,
if
it
*NL*
was
a
sufficient
cause
for
his
contemning
of
them
as
common
and
*NL*
vulgar
,
that
something
was
to
be
found
in
the
most
paltry
alleys
under
*NL*
the
same
name
.
In
reality
,
true
nature
is
as
difficult
to
be
met
with
*NL*
in
authors
,
as
the
Bayonne
ham
,
or
Bologna
sausage
,
is
to
be
found
in
*NL*
the
shops
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
whole
,
to
continue
the
same
metaphor
,
consists
in
the
cookery
*NL*
of
the
author
;
for
,
as
Mr
Pope
tells
us
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
wit
is
nature
to

*NL*
The

animal
which
hath
the
honour
to
have
some
part
of
his
flesh
*NL*
eaten
at
the

some
of

How
pleased

will
the

be
to
find
that
we
have

in

adhered

of
the
best
cook
which
the

perhaps
that
of

,
hath
produced
.
This
great
man
,
as
is
well
known
to
all
*NL*
lovers
of
polite
eating
,
begins
at
first
by
setting
plain
things
*NL*
before
his
hungry
guests
,
rising
afterwards
by
degrees
as
their
*NL*
stomachs
may
be
supposed
to
decrease
,
to
the
very
quintessence
of
*NL*
sauce
and
spices
.
In

we
shall
represent
human
nature
at
*NL*
first
to
the
keen
appetite
of
our

,
in
that
more
plain

simple
manner
in
which
it
is
found

hereafter
*NL*
hash

all
the
high
French

affectation

By

,

we

not

our

may
be
rendered
desirous
to

*NL*
*NL*
A
short
description
of
squire
Allworthy
,
and
a
fuller
account
of
Miss
*NL*
Bridget
Allworthy
,
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
part
of
the
western
division
of
this
kingdom
which
is
commonly
*NL*
called
Somersetshire
,
there
lately
lived
,
and
perhaps
lives
still
,
a
*NL*
gentleman
whose
name
was
Allworthy
,
and
who
might
well
be
called
the
*NL*
favourite
of
both
nature
and
fortune
;
for
both
of
these
seem
to
have
*NL*
contended
which
should
bless
and
enrich
him
most
.
In
this
contention
,
*NL*
nature
may
seem
to
some
to
have
come
off
victorious
,
as
she
bestowed
*NL*
on
him
many
gifts
,
while
fortune
had
only
one
gift
in
her
power
;
but
*NL*
in
pouring
forth
this
,
she
was
so
very
profuse
,
that
others
perhaps
*NL*
may
think
this
single
endowment
to
have
been
more
than
equivalent
to
*NL*
all
the
various
blessings
which
he
enjoyed
from
nature
.
From
the
*NL*
former
of
these
,
he
derived
an
agreeable
person
,
a
sound
constitution
,
*NL*
a
solid
understanding
,
and
a
benevolent
heart
;
by
the
latter
,
he
was
*NL*
decreed
to
the
inheritance
of
one
of
the
largest
estates
in
the
*NL*
county
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gentleman
had
in
his
youth
married
a
very
worthy
and
beautiful
*NL*
woman
,
of
whom
he
had
been
extremely
fond
:
by
her
he
had
three
*NL*
children
,
all
of
whom
died
in
their
infancy
.
He
had
likewise
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
of
burying
this
beloved
wife
herself
,
about
five
years
*NL*
before
the
time
in
which
this
history
chuses
to
set
out
.
This
loss
,
*NL*
however
great
,
he
bore
like
a
man
of
sense
and
constancy
,
though
it
*NL*
must
be
confest
he
would
often
talk
a
little
whimsically
on
this
head
;
*NL*
for
he
sometimes
said
he
looked
on
himself
as
still
married
,
and
*NL*
considered
his
wife
as
only
gone
a
little
before
him
,
a
journey
which
*NL*
he
should
most
certainly
,
sooner
or
later
,
take
after
her
;
and
that
he
*NL*
had
not
the
least
doubt
of
meeting
her
again
in
a
place
where
he
*NL*
should
never
part
with
her
more
--
sentiments
for
which
his
sense
was
*NL*
arraigned
by
one
part
of
his
neighbours
,
his
religion
by
a
second
,
and
*NL*
his
sincerity
by
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
lived
,
for
the
most
part
,
retired
in
the
country
,
with
one
*NL*
sister
,
for
whom
he
had
a
very
tender
affection
.
This
lady
was
now
*NL*
somewhat
past
the
age
of
thirty
,
an
aera
at
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
*NL*
the
malicious
,
the
title
of
old
maid
may
with
no
impropriety
be
*NL*
assumed
.
She
was
of
that
species
of
women
whom
you
commend
rather
for
*NL*
good
qualities
than
beauty
,
and
who
are
generally
called
,
by
their
own
*NL*
sex
,
very
good
sort
of
women
--
as
good
a
sort
of
woman
,
madam
,
as
you
*NL*
would
wish
to
know
.
Indeed
,
she
was
so
far
from
regretting
want
of
*NL*
beauty
,
that
she
never
mentioned
that
perfection
,
if
it
can
be
called
*NL*
one
,
without
contempt
;
and
would
often
thank
God
she
was
not
as
*NL*
handsome
as
Miss
Such-a-one
,
whom
perhaps
beauty
had
led
into
errors
*NL*
which
she
might
have
otherwise
avoided
.
Miss
Bridget
Allworthy
-LRB-
for
*NL*
that
was
the
name
of
this
lady
-RRB-
very
rightly
conceived
the
charms
of
*NL*
person
in
a
woman
to
be
no
better
than
snares
for
herself
,
as
well
as
*NL*
for
others
;
and
yet
so
discreet
was
she
in
her
conduct
,
that
her
*NL*
prudence
was
as
much
on
the
guard
as
if
she
had
all
the
snares
to
*NL*
apprehend
which
were
ever
laid
for
her
whole
sex
.
Indeed
,
I
have
*NL*
observed
,
though
it
may
seem
unaccountable
to
the
reader
,
that
this
*NL*
guard
of
prudence
,
like
the
trained
bands
,
is
always
readiest
to
go
on
*NL*
duty
where
there
is
the
least
danger
.
It
often
basely
and
cowardly
*NL*
deserts
those
paragons
for
whom
the
men
are
all
wishing
,
sighing
,
*NL*
dying
,
and
spreading
,
every
net
in
their
power
;
and
constantly
attends
*NL*
at
the
heels
of
that
higher
order
of
women
for
whom
the
other
sex
have
*NL*
a
more
distant
and
awful
respect
,
and
whom
-LRB-
from
despair
,
I
suppose
,
*NL*
of
success
-RRB-
they
never
venture
to
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
I
think
proper
,
before
we
proceed
any
farther
together
,
to
*NL*
acquaint
thee
that
I
intend
to
digress
,
through
this
whole
history
,
as
*NL*
often
as
I
see
occasion
,
of
which
I
am
myself
a
better
judge
than
any
*NL*
pitiful
critic
whatever
;
and
here
I
must
desire
all
those
critics
to
*NL*
mind
their
own
business
,
and
not
to
intermeddle
with
affairs
or
works
*NL*
which
no
ways
concern
them
;
for
till
they
produce
the
authority
by
*NL*
which
they
are
constituted
judges
,
I
shall
not
plead
to
their
*NL*
jurisdiction
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
An
odd
accident
which
befel
Mr
Allworthy
at
his
return
home
.
The
*NL*
decent
behaviour
of
Mrs
Deborah
Wilkins
,
with
some
proper
*NL*
animadversions
on
bastards
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
told
my
reader
,
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
*NL*
inherited
a
large
fortune
;
that
he
had
a
good
heart
,
and
no
family
.
*NL*
Hence
,
doubtless
,
it
will
be
concluded
by
many
that
he
lived
like
an
*NL*
honest
man
,
owed
no
one
a
shilling
,
took
nothing
but
what
was
his
own
,
*NL*
kept
a
good
house
,
entertained
his
neighbours
with
a
hearty
welcome
at
*NL*
his
table
,
and
was
charitable
to
the
poor
,
i.e.
to
those
who
had
*NL*
rather
beg
than
work
,
by
giving
them
the
offals
from
it
;
that
he
died
*NL*
immensely
rich
and
built
an
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
true
it
is
that
he
did
many
of
these
things
;
but
had
he
done
*NL*
nothing
more
I
should
have
left
him
to
have
recorded
his
own
merit
on
*NL*
some
fair
freestone
over
the
door
of
that
hospital
.
Matters
of
a
much
*NL*
more
extraordinary
kind
are
to
be
the
subject
of
this
history
,
or
I
*NL*
should
grossly
mis-spend
my
time
in
writing
so
voluminous
a
work
;
and
*NL*
you
,
my
sagacious
friend
,
might
with
equal
profit
and
pleasure
travel
*NL*
through
some
pages
which
certain
droll
authors
have
been
facetiously
*NL*
pleased
to
call
_
The
History
of
England
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
had
been
absent
a
full
quarter
of
a
year
in
London
,
on
*NL*
some
very
particular
business
,
though
I
know
not
what
it
was
;
but
*NL*
judge
of
its
importance
by
its
having
detained
him
so
long
from
home
,
*NL*
whence
he
had
not
been
absent
a
month
at
a
time
during
the
space
of
*NL*
many
years
.
He
came
to
his
house
very
late
in
the
evening
,
and
after
a
*NL*
short
supper
with
his
sister
,
retired
much
fatigued
to
his
chamber
.
*NL*
Here
,
having
spent
some
minutes
on
his
knees
--
a
custom
which
he
never
*NL*
broke
through
on
any
account
--
he
was
preparing
to
step
into
bed
,
when
,
*NL*
upon
opening
the
cloathes
,
to
his
great
surprize
he
beheld
an
infant
,
*NL*
wrapt
up
in
some
coarse
linen
,
in
a
sweet
and
profound
sleep
,
between
*NL*
his
sheets
.
He
stood
some
time
lost
in
astonishment
at
this
sight
;
*NL*
but
,
as
good
nature
had
always
the
ascendant
in
his
mind
,
he
soon
*NL*
began
to
be
touched
with
sentiments
of
compassion
for
the
little
*NL*
wretch
before
him
.
He
then
rang
his
bell
,
and
ordered
an
elderly
*NL*
woman-servant
to
rise
immediately
,
and
come
to
him
;
and
in
the
*NL*
meantime
was
so
eager
in
contemplating
the
beauty
of
innocence
,
*NL*
appearing
in
those
lively
colours
with
which
infancy
and
sleep
always
*NL*
display
it
,
that
his
thoughts
were
too
much
engaged
to
reflect
that
he
*NL*
was
in
his
shirt
when
the
matron
came
in
.
She
had
indeed
given
her
*NL*
master
sufficient
time
to
dress
himself
;
for
out
of
respect
to
him
,
*NL*
and
regard
to
decency
,
she
had
spent
many
minutes
in
adjusting
her
*NL*
hair
at
the
looking-glass
,
notwithstanding
all
the
hurry
in
which
she
*NL*
had
been
summoned
by
the
servant
,
and
though
her
master
,
for
aught
she
*NL*
knew
,
lay
expiring
in
an
apoplexy
,
or
in
some
other
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
not
be
wondered
at
that
a
creature
who
had
so
strict
a
regard
*NL*
to
decency
in
her
own
person
,
should
be
shocked
at
the
least
deviation
*NL*
from
it
in
another
.
She
therefore
no
sooner
opened
the
door
,
and
saw
*NL*
her
master
standing
by
the
bedside
in
his
shirt
,
with
a
candle
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
than
she
started
back
in
a
most
terrible
fright
,
and
might
*NL*
perhaps
have
swooned
away
,
had
he
not
now
recollected
his
being
*NL*
undrest
,
and
put
an
end
to
her
terrors
by
desiring
her
to
stay
without
*NL*
the
door
till
he
had
thrown
some
cloathes
over
his
back
,
and
was
*NL*
become
incapable
of
shocking
the
pure
eyes
of
Mrs
Deborah
Wilkins
,
*NL*
who
,
though
in
the
fifty-second
year
of
her
age
,
vowed
she
had
never
*NL*
beheld
a
man
without
his
coat
.
Sneerers
and
prophane
wits
may
perhaps
*NL*
laugh
at
her
first
fright
;
yet
my
graver
reader
,
when
he
considers
the
*NL*
time
of
night
,
the
summons
from
her
bed
,
and
the
situation
in
which
*NL*
she
found
her
master
,
will
highly
justify
and
applaud
her
conduct
,
*NL*
unless
the
prudence
which
must
be
supposed
to
attend
maidens
at
that
*NL*
period
of
life
at
which
Mrs
Deborah
had
arrived
,
should
a
little
*NL*
lessen
his
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs
Deborah
returned
into
the
room
,
and
was
acquainted
by
her
*NL*
master
with
the
finding
the
little
infant
,
her
consternation
was
*NL*
rather
greater
than
his
had
been
;
nor
could
she
refrain
from
crying
*NL*
out
,
with
great
horror
of
accent
as
well
as
look
,
``
My
good
sir
!
what
's
*NL*
to
be
done
?
''
Mr
Allworthy
answered
,
she
must
take
care
of
the
child
*NL*
that
evening
,
and
in
the
morning
he
would
give
orders
to
provide
it
a
*NL*
nurse
.
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
says
she
;
``
and
I
hope
your
worship
will
send
out
*NL*
your
warrant
to
take
up
the
hussy
its
mother
,
for
she
must
be
one
of
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
;
and
I
should
be
glad
to
see
her
committed
to
*NL*
Bridewell
,
and
whipt
at
the
cart
's
tail
.
Indeed
,
such
wicked
sluts
*NL*
can
not
be
too
severely
punished
.
I
'll
warrant
't
is
not
her
first
,
by
*NL*
her
impudence
in
laying
it
to
your
worship
.
''
``
In
laying
it
to
me
,
*NL*
Deborah
!
''
answered
Allworthy
:
``
I
ca
n't
think
she
hath
any
such
design
.
*NL*
I
suppose
she
hath
only
taken
this
method
to
provide
for
her
child
;
*NL*
and
truly
I
am
glad
she
hath
not
done
worse
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
what
is
*NL*
worse
,
''
cries
Deborah
,
``
than
for
such
wicked
strumpets
to
lay
their
*NL*
sins
at
honest
men
's
doors
;
and
though
your
worship
knows
your
own
*NL*
innocence
,
yet
the
world
is
censorious
;
and
it
hath
been
many
an
*NL*
honest
man
's
hap
to
pass
for
the
father
of
children
he
never
begot
;
*NL*
and
if
your
worship
should
provide
for
the
child
,
it
may
make
the
*NL*
people
the
apter
to
believe
;
besides
,
why
should
your
worship
provide
*NL*
for
what
the
parish
is
obliged
to
maintain
?
For
my
own
part
,
if
it
was
*NL*
an
honest
man
's
child
,
indeed
--
but
for
my
own
part
,
it
goes
against
me
*NL*
to
touch
these
misbegotten
wretches
,
whom
I
do
n't
look
upon
as
my
*NL*
fellow-creatures
.
Faugh
!
how
it
stinks
!
It
doth
not
smell
like
a
*NL*
Christian
.
If
I
might
be
so
bold
to
give
my
advice
,
I
would
have
it
*NL*
put
in
a
basket
,
and
sent
out
and
laid
at
the
churchwarden
's
door
.
It
*NL*
is
a
good
night
,
only
a
little
rainy
and
windy
;
and
if
it
was
well
*NL*
wrapt
up
,
and
put
in
a
warm
basket
,
it
is
two
to
one
but
it
lives
till
*NL*
it
is
found
in
the
morning
.
But
if
it
should
not
,
we
have
discharged
*NL*
our
duty
in
taking
proper
care
of
it
;
and
it
is
,
perhaps
,
better
for
*NL*
such
creatures
to
die
in
a
state
of
innocence
,
than
to
grow
up
and
*NL*
imitate
their
mothers
;
for
nothing
better
can
be
expected
of
them
.

There
were
some
strokes
in
this
speech
which
perhaps
would
have
*NL*
offended
Mr
Allworthy
,
had
he
strictly
attended
to
it
;
but
he
had
now
*NL*
got
one
of
his
fingers
into
the
infant
's
hand
,
which
,
by
its
gentle
*NL*
pressure
,
seeming
to
implore
his
assistance
,
had
certainly
out-pleaded
*NL*
the
eloquence
of
Mrs
Deborah
,
had
it
been
ten
times
greater
than
it
*NL*
was
.
He
now
gave
Mrs
Deborah
positive
orders
to
take
the
child
to
her
*NL*
own
bed
,
and
to
call
up
a
maid-servant
to
provide
it
pap
,
and
other
*NL*
things
,
against
it
waked
.
He
likewise
ordered
that
proper
cloathes
*NL*
should
be
procured
for
it
early
in
the
morning
,
and
that
it
should
be
*NL*
brought
to
himself
as
soon
as
he
was
stirring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
discernment
of
Mrs
Wilkins
,
and
such
the
respect
she
bore
*NL*
her
master
,
under
whom
she
enjoyed
a
most
excellent
place
,
that
her
*NL*
scruples
gave
way
to
his
peremptory
commands
;
and
she
took
the
child
*NL*
under
her
arms
,
without
any
apparent
disgust
at
the
illegality
of
its
*NL*
birth
;
and
declaring
it
was
a
sweet
little
infant
,
walked
off
with
it
*NL*
to
her
own
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
here
betook
himself
to
those
pleasing
slumbers
which
a
heart
*NL*
that
hungers
after
goodness
is
apt
to
enjoy
when
thoroughly
satisfied
.
*NL*
As
these
are
possibly
sweeter
than
what
are
occasioned
by
any
other
*NL*
hearty
meal
,
I
should
take
more
pains
to
display
them
to
the
reader
,
*NL*
if
I
knew
any
air
to
recommend
him
to
for
the
procuring
such
an
*NL*
appetite
.

The
reader
's
neck
brought
into
danger
by
a
description
;
his
escape
;
*NL*
and
the
great
condescension
of
Miss
Bridget
Allworthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Gothic
stile
of
building
could
produce
nothing
nobler
than
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
's
house
.
There
was
an
air
of
grandeur
in
it
that
struck
you
*NL*
with
awe
,
and
rivalled
the
beauties
of
the
best
Grecian
architecture
;
*NL*
and
it
was
as
commodious
within
as
venerable
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
stood
on
the
south-east
side
of
a
hill
,
but
nearer
the
bottom
than
*NL*
the
top
of
it
,
so
as
to
be
sheltered
from
the
north-east
by
a
grove
of
*NL*
old
oaks
which
rose
above
it
in
a
gradual
ascent
of
near
half
a
mile
,
*NL*
and
yet
high
enough
to
enjoy
a
most
charming
prospect
of
the
valley
*NL*
beneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
grove
was
a
fine
lawn
,
sloping
down
towards
the
*NL*
house
,
near
the
summit
of
which
rose
a
plentiful
spring
,
gushing
out
*NL*
of
a
rock
covered
with
firs
,
and
forming
a
constant
cascade
of
about
*NL*
thirty
feet
,
not
carried
down
a
regular
flight
of
steps
,
but
tumbling
*NL*
in
a
natural
fall
over
the
broken
and
mossy
stones
till
it
came
to
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
rock
,
then
running
off
in
a
pebly
channel
,
that
with
*NL*
many
lesser
falls
winded
along
,
till
it
fell
into
a
lake
at
the
foot
*NL*
of
the
hill
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
the
house
on
the
south
*NL*
side
,
and
which
was
seen
from
every
room
in
the
front
.
Out
of
this
*NL*
lake
,
which
filled
the
center
of
a
beautiful
plain
,
embellished
with
*NL*
groups
of
beeches
and
elms
,
and
fed
with
sheep
,
issued
a
river
,
that
*NL*
for
several
miles
was
seen
to
meander
through
an
amazing
variety
of
*NL*
meadows
and
woods
till
it
emptied
itself
into
the
sea
,
with
a
large
*NL*
arm
of
which
,
and
an
island
beyond
it
,
the
prospect
was
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
right
of
this
valley
opened
another
of
less
extent
,
adorned
*NL*
with
several
villages
,
and
terminated
by
one
of
the
towers
of
an
old
*NL*
ruined
abby
,
grown
over
with
ivy
,
and
part
of
the
front
,
which
*NL*
remained
still
entire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
left-hand
scene
presented
the
view
of
a
very
fine
park
,
composed
*NL*
of
very
unequal
ground
,
and
agreeably
varied
with
all
the
diversity
*NL*
that
hills
,
lawns
,
wood
,
and
water
,
laid
out
with
admirable
taste
,
but
*NL*
owing
less
to
art
than
to
nature
,
could
give
.
Beyond
this
,
the
country
*NL*
gradually
rose
into
a
ridge
of
wild
mountains
,
the
tops
of
which
were
*NL*
above
the
clouds
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
the
middle
of
May
,
and
the
morning
was
remarkably
serene
,
*NL*
when
Mr
Allworthy
walked
forth
on
the
terrace
,
where
the
dawn
opened
*NL*
every
minute
that
lovely
prospect
we
have
before
described
to
his
eye
;
*NL*
and
now
having
sent
forth
streams
of
light
,
which
ascended
the
blue
*NL*
firmament
before
him
,
as
harbingers
preceding
his
pomp
,
in
the
full
*NL*
blaze
of
his
majesty
rose
the
sun
,
than
which
one
object
alone
in
this
*NL*
lower
creation
could
be
more
glorious
,
and
that
Mr
Allworthy
himself
*NL*
presented
--
a
human
being
replete
with
benevolence
,
meditating
in
what
*NL*
manner
he
might
render
himself
most
acceptable
to
his
Creator
,
by
*NL*
doing
most
good
to
his
creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
take
care
.
I
have
unadvisedly
led
thee
to
the
top
of
as
high
a
*NL*
hill
as
Mr
Allworthy
's
,
and
how
to
get
thee
down
without
breaking
thy
*NL*
neck
,
I
do
not
well
know
.
However
,
let
us
e
`
en
venture
to
slide
down
*NL*
together
;
for
Miss
Bridget
rings
her
bell
,
and
Mr
Allworthy
is
*NL*
summoned
to
breakfast
,
where
I
must
attend
,
and
,
if
you
please
,
shall
*NL*
be
glad
of
your
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usual
compliments
having
past
between
Mr
Allworthy
and
Miss
*NL*
Bridget
,
and
the
tea
being
poured
out
,
he
summoned
Mrs
Wilkins
,
and
*NL*
told
his
sister
he
had
a
present
for
her
,
for
which
she
thanked
*NL*
him
--
imagining
,
I
suppose
,
it
had
been
a
gown
,
or
some
ornament
for
*NL*
her
person
.
Indeed
,
he
very
often
made
her
such
presents
;
and
she
,
in
*NL*
complacence
to
him
,
spent
much
time
in
adorning
herself
.
I
say
in
*NL*
complacence
to
him
,
because
she
always
exprest
the
greatest
contempt
*NL*
for
dress
,
and
for
those
ladies
who
made
it
their
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
such
was
her
expectation
,
how
was
she
disappointed
when
Mrs
*NL*
Wilkins
,
according
to
the
order
she
had
received
from
her
master
,
*NL*
produced
the
little
infant
?
Great
surprizes
,
as
hath
been
observed
,
*NL*
are
apt
to
be
silent
;
and
so
was
Miss
Bridget
,
till
her
brother
began
,
*NL*
and
told
her
the
whole
story
,
which
,
as
the
reader
knows
it
already
,
*NL*
we
shall
not
repeat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bridget
had
always
exprest
so
great
a
regard
for
what
the
ladies
*NL*
are
pleased
to
call
virtue
,
and
had
herself
maintained
such
a
severity
*NL*
of
character
,
that
it
was
expected
,
especially
by
Wilkins
,
that
she
*NL*
would
have
vented
much
bitterness
on
this
occasion
,
and
would
have
*NL*
voted
for
sending
the
child
,
as
a
kind
of
noxious
animal
,
immediately
*NL*
out
of
the
house
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
she
rather
took
the
*NL*
good-natured
side
of
the
question
,
intimated
some
compassion
for
the
*NL*
helpless
little
creature
,
and
commended
her
brother
's
charity
in
what
*NL*
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
reader
may
account
for
this
behaviour
from
her
*NL*
condescension
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
when
we
have
informed
him
that
the
good
*NL*
man
had
ended
his
narrative
with
owning
a
resolution
to
take
care
of
*NL*
the
child
,
and
to
breed
him
up
as
his
own
;
for
,
to
acknowledge
the
*NL*
truth
,
she
was
always
ready
to
oblige
her
brother
,
and
very
seldom
,
if
*NL*
ever
,
contradicted
his
sentiments
.
She
would
,
indeed
,
sometimes
make
a
*NL*
few
observations
,
as
that
men
were
headstrong
,
and
must
have
their
own
*NL*
way
,
and
would
wish
she
had
been
blest
with
an
independent
fortune
;
*NL*
but
these
were
always
vented
in
a
low
voice
,
and
at
the
most
amounted
*NL*
only
to
what
is
called
muttering
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
what
she
withheld
from
the
infant
,
she
bestowed
with
the
*NL*
utmost
profuseness
on
the
poor
unknown
mother
,
whom
she
called
an
*NL*
impudent
slut
,
a
wanton
hussy
,
an
audacious
harlot
,
a
wicked
jade
,
a
*NL*
vile
strumpet
,
with
every
other
appellation
with
which
the
tongue
of
*NL*
virtue
never
fails
to
lash
those
who
bring
a
disgrace
on
the
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
consultation
was
now
entered
into
how
to
proceed
in
order
to
*NL*
discover
the
mother
.
A
scrutiny
was
first
made
into
the
characters
of
*NL*
the
female
servants
of
the
house
,
who
were
all
acquitted
by
Mrs
*NL*
Wilkins
,
and
with
apparent
merit
;
for
she
had
collected
them
herself
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
it
would
be
difficult
to
find
such
another
set
of
*NL*
scarecrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
step
was
to
examine
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
parish
;
and
*NL*
this
was
referred
to
Mrs
Wilkins
,
who
was
to
enquire
with
all
*NL*
imaginable
diligence
,
and
to
make
her
report
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matters
being
thus
settled
,
Mr
Allworthy
withdrew
to
his
study
,
as
was
*NL*
his
custom
,
and
left
the
child
to
his
sister
,
who
,
at
his
desire
,
had
*NL*
undertaken
the
care
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
v.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
a
few
common
matters
,
with
a
very
uncommon
observation
upon
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
master
was
departed
,
Mrs
Deborah
stood
silent
,
expecting
her
*NL*
cue
from
Miss
Bridget
;
for
as
to
what
had
past
before
her
master
,
the
*NL*
prudent
housekeeper
by
no
means
relied
upon
it
,
as
she
had
often
known
*NL*
the
sentiments
of
the
lady
in
her
brother
's
absence
to
differ
greatly
*NL*
from
those
which
she
had
expressed
in
his
presence
.
Miss
Bridget
did
*NL*
not
,
however
,
suffer
her
to
continue
long
in
this
doubtful
situation
;
*NL*
for
having
looked
some
time
earnestly
at
the
child
,
as
it
lay
asleep
*NL*
in
the
lap
of
Mrs
Deborah
,
the
good
lady
could
not
forbear
giving
it
a
*NL*
hearty
kiss
,
at
the
same
time
declaring
herself
wonderfully
pleased
*NL*
with
its
beauty
and
innocence
.
Mrs
Deborah
no
sooner
observed
this
*NL*
than
she
fell
to
squeezing
and
kissing
,
with
as
great
raptures
as
*NL*
sometimes
inspire
the
sage
dame
of
forty
and
five
towards
a
youthful
*NL*
and
vigorous
bridegroom
,
crying
out
,
in
a
shrill
voice
,
``
O
,
the
dear
*NL*
little
creature
!
--
The
dear
,
sweet
,
pretty
creature
!
Well
,
I
vow
it
is
*NL*
as
fine
a
boy
as
ever
was
seen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
exclamations
continued
till
they
were
interrupted
by
the
lady
,
*NL*
who
now
proceeded
to
execute
the
commission
given
her
by
her
brother
,
*NL*
and
gave
orders
for
providing
all
necessaries
for
the
child
,
*NL*
appointing
a
very
good
room
in
the
house
for
his
nursery
.
Her
orders
*NL*
were
indeed
so
liberal
,
that
,
had
it
been
a
child
of
her
own
,
she
*NL*
could
not
have
exceeded
them
;
but
,
lest
the
virtuous
reader
may
*NL*
condemn
her
for
showing
too
great
regard
to
a
base-born
infant
,
to
*NL*
which
all
charity
is
condemned
by
law
as
irreligious
,
we
think
proper
*NL*
to
observe
that
she
concluded
the
whole
with
saying
,
``
Since
it
was
her
*NL*
brother
's
whim
to
adopt
the
little
brat
,
she
supposed
little
master
*NL*
must
be
treated
with
great
tenderness
.
For
her
part
,
she
could
not
*NL*
help
thinking
it
was
an
encouragement
to
vice
;
but
that
she
knew
too
*NL*
much
of
the
obstinacy
of
mankind
to
oppose
any
of
their
ridiculous
*NL*
humours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
reflections
of
this
nature
she
usually
,
as
has
been
hinted
,
*NL*
accompanied
every
act
of
compliance
with
her
brother
's
inclinations
;
*NL*
and
surely
nothing
could
more
contribute
to
heighten
the
merit
of
this
*NL*
compliance
than
a
declaration
that
she
knew
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
*NL*
folly
and
unreasonableness
of
those
inclinations
to
which
she
*NL*
submitted
.
Tacit
obedience
implies
no
force
upon
the
will
,
and
*NL*
consequently
may
be
easily
,
and
without
any
pains
,
preserved
;
but
when
*NL*
a
wife
,
a
child
,
a
relation
,
or
a
friend
,
performs
what
we
desire
,
*NL*
with
grumbling
and
reluctance
,
with
expressions
of
dislike
and
*NL*
dissatisfaction
,
the
manifest
difficulty
which
they
undergo
must
*NL*
greatly
enhance
the
obligation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
is
one
of
those
deep
observations
which
very
few
readers
can
*NL*
be
supposed
capable
of
making
themselves
,
I
have
thought
proper
to
*NL*
lend
them
my
assistance
;
but
this
is
a
favour
rarely
to
be
expected
in
*NL*
the
course
of
my
work
.
Indeed
,
I
shall
seldom
or
never
so
indulge
him
,
*NL*
unless
in
such
instances
as
this
,
where
nothing
but
the
inspiration
*NL*
with
which
we
writers
are
gifted
,
can
possibly
enable
any
one
to
make
*NL*
the
discovery

Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Deborah
is
introduced
into
the
parish
with
a
simile
.
A
short
*NL*
account
of
Jenny
Jones
,
with
the
difficulties
and
discouragements
*NL*
which
may
attend
young
women
in
the
pursuit
of
learning
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Deborah
,
having
disposed
of
the
child
according
to
the
will
of
her
*NL*
master
,
now
prepared
to
visit
those
habitations
which
were
supposed
to
*NL*
conceal
its
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
otherwise
than
when
a
kite
,
tremendous
bird
,
is
beheld
by
the
*NL*
feathered
generation
soaring
aloft
,
and
hovering
over
their
heads
,
the
*NL*
amorous
dove
,
and
every
innocent
little
bird
,
spread
wide
the
alarm
,
*NL*
and
fly
trembling
to
their
hiding-places
.
He
proudly
beats
the
air
,
*NL*
conscious
of
his
dignity
,
and
meditates
intended
mischief
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
when
the
approach
of
Mrs
Deborah
was
proclaimed
through
the
street
,
*NL*
all
the
inhabitants
ran
trembling
into
their
houses
,
each
matron
*NL*
dreading
lest
the
visit
should
fall
to
her
lot
.
She
with
stately
steps
*NL*
proudly
advances
over
the
field
:
aloft
she
bears
her
towering
head
,
*NL*
filled
with
conceit
of
her
own
pre-eminence
,
and
schemes
to
effect
her
*NL*
intended
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sagacious
reader
will
not
from
this
simile
imagine
these
poor
*NL*
people
had
any
apprehension
of
the
design
with
which
Mrs
Wilkins
was
*NL*
now
coming
towards
them
;
but
as
the
great
beauty
of
the
simile
may
*NL*
possibly
sleep
these
hundred
years
,
till
some
future
commentator
shall
*NL*
take
this
work
in
hand
,
I
think
proper
to
lend
the
reader
a
little
*NL*
assistance
in
this
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
my
intention
,
therefore
,
to
signify
,
that
,
as
it
is
the
nature
*NL*
of
a
kite
to
devour
little
birds
,
so
is
it
the
nature
of
such
persons
*NL*
as
Mrs
Wilkins
to
insult
and
tyrannize
over
little
people
.
This
being
*NL*
indeed
the
means
which
they
use
to
recompense
to
themselves
their
*NL*
extreme
servility
and
condescension
to
their
superiors
;
for
nothing
*NL*
can
be
more
reasonable
,
than
that
slaves
and
flatterers
should
exact
*NL*
the
same
taxes
on
all
below
them
,
which
they
themselves
pay
to
all
*NL*
above
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
Mrs
Deborah
had
occasion
to
exert
any
extraordinary
*NL*
condescension
to
Mrs
Bridget
,
and
by
that
means
had
a
little
soured
*NL*
her
natural
disposition
,
it
was
usual
with
her
to
walk
forth
among
*NL*
these
people
,
in
order
to
refine
her
temper
,
by
venting
,
and
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
purging
off
all
ill
humours
;
on
which
account
she
was
by
no
*NL*
means
a
welcome
visitant
:
to
say
the
truth
,
she
was
universally
*NL*
dreaded
and
hated
by
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
arrival
in
this
place
,
she
went
immediately
to
the
habitation
*NL*
of
an
elderly
matron
;
to
whom
,
as
this
matron
had
the
good
fortune
to
*NL*
resemble
herself
in
the
comeliness
of
her
person
,
as
well
as
in
her
*NL*
age
,
she
had
generally
been
more
favourable
than
to
any
of
the
rest
.
*NL*
To
this
woman
she
imparted
what
had
happened
,
and
the
design
upon
*NL*
which
she
was
come
thither
that
morning
.
These
two
began
presently
to
*NL*
scrutinize
the
characters
of
the
several
young
girls
who
lived
in
any
*NL*
of
those
houses
,
and
at
last
fixed
their
strongest
suspicion
on
one
*NL*
Jenny
Jones
,
who
,
they
both
agreed
,
was
the
likeliest
person
to
have
*NL*
committed
this
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Jenny
Jones
was
no
very
comely
girl
,
either
in
her
face
or
*NL*
person
;
but
nature
had
somewhat
compensated
the
want
of
beauty
with
*NL*
what
is
generally
more
esteemed
by
those
ladies
whose
judgment
is
*NL*
arrived
at
years
of
perfect
maturity
,
for
she
had
given
her
a
very
*NL*
uncommon
share
of
understanding
.
This
gift
Jenny
had
a
good
deal
*NL*
improved
by
erudition
.
She
had
lived
several
years
a
servant
with
a
*NL*
schoolmaster
,
who
,
discovering
a
great
quickness
of
parts
in
the
girl
,
*NL*
and
an
extraordinary
desire
of
learning
--
for
every
leisure
hour
she
*NL*
was
always
found
reading
in
the
books
of
the
scholars
--
had
the
*NL*
good-nature
,
or
folly
--
just
as
the
reader
pleases
to
call
it
--
to
*NL*
instruct
her
so
far
,
that
she
obtained
a
competent
skill
in
the
Latin
*NL*
language
,
and
was
,
perhaps
,
as
good
a
scholar
as
most
of
the
young
men
*NL*
of
quality
of
the
age
.
This
advantage
,
however
,
like
most
others
of
an
*NL*
extraordinary
kind
,
was
attended
with
some
small
inconveniences
:
for
*NL*
as
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
,
that
a
young
woman
so
well
*NL*
accomplished
should
have
little
relish
for
the
society
of
those
whom
*NL*
fortune
had
made
her
equals
,
but
whom
education
had
rendered
so
much
*NL*
her
inferiors
;
so
is
it
matter
of
no
greater
astonishment
,
that
this
*NL*
superiority
in
Jenny
,
together
with
that
behaviour
which
is
its
*NL*
certain
consequence
,
should
produce
among
the
rest
some
little
envy
*NL*
and
ill-will
towards
her
;
and
these
had
,
perhaps
,
secretly
burnt
in
*NL*
the
bosoms
of
her
neighbours
ever
since
her
return
from
her
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
envy
did
not
,
however
,
display
itself
openly
,
till
poor
Jenny
,
*NL*
to
the
surprize
of
everybody
,
and
to
the
vexation
of
all
the
young
*NL*
women
in
these
parts
,
had
publickly
shone
forth
on
a
Sunday
in
a
new
*NL*
silk
gown
,
with
a
laced
cap
,
and
other
proper
appendages
to
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flame
,
which
had
before
lain
in
embryo
,
now
burst
forth
.
Jenny
*NL*
had
,
by
her
learning
,
increased
her
own
pride
,
which
none
of
her
*NL*
neighbours
were
kind
enough
to
feed
with
the
honour
she
seemed
to
*NL*
demand
;
and
now
,
instead
of
respect
and
adoration
,
she
gained
nothing
*NL*
but
hatred
and
abuse
by
her
finery
.
The
whole
parish
declared
she
*NL*
could
not
come
honestly
by
such
things
;
and
parents
,
instead
of
*NL*
wishing
their
daughters
the
same
,
felicitated
themselves
that
their
*NL*
children
had
them
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
perhaps
,
it
was
,
that
the
good
woman
first
mentioned
the
name
*NL*
of
this
poor
girl
to
Mrs
Wilkins
;
but
there
was
another
circumstance
*NL*
that
confirmed
the
latter
in
her
suspicion
;
for
Jenny
had
lately
been
*NL*
often
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
.
She
had
officiated
as
nurse
to
Miss
*NL*
Bridget
,
in
a
violent
fit
of
illness
,
and
had
sat
up
many
nights
with
*NL*
that
lady
;
besides
which
,
she
had
been
seen
there
the
very
day
before
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
's
return
,
by
Mrs
Wilkins
herself
,
though
that
sagacious
*NL*
person
had
not
at
first
conceived
any
suspicion
of
her
on
that
*NL*
account
:
for
,
as
she
herself
said
,
``
She
had
always
esteemed
Jenny
as
a
*NL*
very
sober
girl
-LRB-
though
indeed
she
knew
very
little
of
her
-RRB-
,
and
had
*NL*
rather
suspected
some
of
those
wanton
trollops
,
who
gave
themselves
*NL*
airs
,
because
,
forsooth
,
they
thought
themselves
handsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jenny
was
now
summoned
to
appear
in
person
before
Mrs
Deborah
,
which
*NL*
she
immediately
did
.
When
Mrs
Deborah
,
putting
on
the
gravity
of
a
*NL*
judge
,
with
somewhat
more
than
his
austerity
,
began
an
oration
with
*NL*
the
words
,
``
You
audacious
strumpet
!
''
in
which
she
proceeded
rather
to
*NL*
pass
sentence
on
the
prisoner
than
to
accuse
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Mrs
Deborah
was
fully
satisfied
of
the
guilt
of
Jenny
,
from
the
*NL*
reasons
above
shewn
,
it
is
possible
Mr
Allworthy
might
have
required
*NL*
some
stronger
evidence
to
have
convicted
her
;
but
she
saved
her
*NL*
accusers
any
such
trouble
,
by
freely
confessing
the
whole
fact
with
*NL*
which
she
was
charged
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
confession
,
though
delivered
rather
in
terms
of
contrition
,
as
it
*NL*
appeared
,
did
not
at
all
mollify
Mrs
Deborah
,
who
now
pronounced
a
*NL*
second
judgment
against
her
,
in
more
opprobrious
language
than
before
;
*NL*
nor
had
it
any
better
success
with
the
bystanders
,
who
were
now
grown
*NL*
very
numerous
.
Many
of
them
cried
out
,
``
They
thought
what
madam
's
silk
*NL*
gown
would
end
in
;
''
others
spoke
sarcastically
of
her
learning
.
Not
a
*NL*
single
female
was
present
but
found
some
means
of
expressing
her
*NL*
abhorrence
of
poor
Jenny
,
who
bore
all
very
patiently
,
except
the
*NL*
malice
of
one
woman
,
who
reflected
upon
her
person
,
and
tossing
up
her
*NL*
nose
,
said
,
``
The
man
must
have
a
good
stomach
who
would
give
silk
*NL*
gowns
for
such
sort
of
trumpery
!
''
Jenny
replied
to
this
with
a
*NL*
bitterness
which
might
have
surprized
a
judicious
person
,
who
had
*NL*
observed
the
tranquillity
with
which
she
bore
all
the
affronts
to
her
*NL*
chastity
;
but
her
patience
was
perhaps
tired
out
,
for
this
is
a
virtue
*NL*
which
is
very
apt
to
be
fatigued
by
exercise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Deborah
having
succeeded
beyond
her
hopes
in
her
inquiry
,
returned
*NL*
with
much
triumph
,
and
,
at
the
appointed
hour
,
made
a
faithful
report
*NL*
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
was
much
surprized
at
the
relation
;
for
he
had
*NL*
heard
of
the
extraordinary
parts
and
improvements
of
this
girl
,
whom
*NL*
he
intended
to
have
given
in
marriage
,
together
with
a
small
living
,
*NL*
to
a
neighbouring
curate
.
His
concern
,
therefore
,
on
this
occasion
,
*NL*
was
at
least
equal
to
the
satisfaction
which
appeared
in
Mrs
Deborah
,
*NL*
and
to
many
readers
may
seem
much
more
reasonable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bridget
blessed
herself
,
and
said
,
``
For
her
part
,
she
should
*NL*
never
hereafter
entertain
a
good
opinion
of
any
woman
.
''
For
Jenny
*NL*
before
this
had
the
happiness
of
being
much
in
her
good
graces
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prudent
housekeeper
was
again
dispatched
to
bring
the
unhappy
*NL*
culprit
before
Mr
Allworthy
,
in
order
,
not
as
it
was
hoped
by
some
,
*NL*
and
expected
by
all
,
to
be
sent
to
the
house
of
correction
,
but
to
*NL*
receive
wholesome
admonition
and
reproof
;
which
those
who
relish
that
*NL*
kind
of
instructive
writing
may
peruse
in
the
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
such
grave
matter
,
that
the
reader
can
not
laugh
once
*NL*
through
the
whole
chapter
,
unless
peradventure
he
should
laugh
at
the
*NL*
author
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jenny
appeared
,
Mr
Allworthy
took
her
into
his
study
,
and
spoke
*NL*
to
her
as
follows
:
``
You
know
,
child
,
it
is
in
my
power
as
a
*NL*
magistrate
,
to
punish
you
very
rigorously
for
what
you
have
done
;
and
*NL*
you
will
,
perhaps
,
be
the
more
apt
to
fear
I
should
execute
that
*NL*
power
,
because
you
have
in
a
manner
laid
your
sins
at
my
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
perhaps
,
this
is
one
reason
which
hath
determined
me
to
act
in
a
*NL*
milder
manner
with
you
:
for
,
as
no
private
resentment
should
ever
*NL*
influence
a
magistrate
,
I
will
be
so
far
from
considering
your
having
*NL*
deposited
the
infant
in
my
house
as
an
aggravation
of
your
offence
,
*NL*
that
I
will
suppose
,
in
your
favour
,
this
to
have
proceeded
from
a
*NL*
natural
affection
to
your
child
,
since
you
might
have
some
hopes
to
*NL*
see
it
thus
better
provided
for
than
was
in
the
power
of
yourself
,
or
*NL*
its
wicked
father
,
to
provide
for
it
.
I
should
indeed
have
been
highly
*NL*
offended
with
you
had
you
exposed
the
little
wretch
in
the
manner
of
*NL*
some
inhuman
mothers
,
who
seem
no
less
to
have
abandoned
their
*NL*
humanity
,
than
to
have
parted
with
their
chastity
.
It
is
the
other
*NL*
part
of
your
offence
,
therefore
,
upon
which
I
intend
to
admonish
you
,
*NL*
I
mean
the
violation
of
your
chastity
;
--
a
crime
,
however
lightly
it
*NL*
may
be
treated
by
debauched
persons
,
very
heinous
in
itself
,
and
very
*NL*
dreadful
in
its
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
heinous
nature
of
this
offence
must
be
sufficiently
apparent
to
*NL*
every
Christian
,
inasmuch
as
it
is
committed
in
defiance
of
the
laws
*NL*
of
our
religion
,
and
of
the
express
commands
of
Him
who
founded
that
*NL*
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
its
consequences
may
well
be
argued
to
be
dreadful
;
for
what
*NL*
can
be
more
so
,
than
to
incur
the
divine
displeasure
,
by
the
breach
of
*NL*
the
divine
commands
;
and
that
in
an
instance
against
which
the
highest
*NL*
vengeance
is
specifically
denounced
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
these
things
,
though
too
little
,
I
am
afraid
,
regarded
,
are
so
*NL*
plain
,
that
mankind
,
however
they
may
want
to
be
reminded
,
can
never
*NL*
need
information
on
this
head
.
A
hint
,
therefore
,
to
awaken
your
sense
*NL*
of
this
matter
,
shall
suffice
;
for
I
would
inspire
you
with
*NL*
repentance
,
and
not
drive
you
to
desperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
other
consequences
,
not
indeed
so
dreadful
or
replete
with
*NL*
horror
as
this
;
and
yet
such
,
as
,
if
attentively
considered
,
must
,
one
*NL*
would
think
,
deter
all
of
your
sex
at
least
from
the
commission
of
*NL*
this
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
by
it
you
are
rendered
infamous
,
and
driven
,
like
lepers
of
old
,
*NL*
out
of
society
;
at
least
,
from
the
society
of
all
but
wicked
and
*NL*
reprobate
persons
;
for
no
others
will
associate
with
you
.
*NL*
*NL*

ends

``
Can

have

strong

as
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
base
and
mean
must
that
woman
be
,
how
void
of
that
dignity
of
*NL*
mind
,
and
decent
pride
,
without
which
we
are
not
worthy
the
name
of
*NL*
human
creatures
,
who
can
bear
to
level
herself
with
the
lowest
animal
,
*NL*
and
to
sacrifice
all
that
is
great
and
noble
in
her
,
all
her

*NL*
part
,
to
an
appetite
which
she
hath
in
common
with
the
vilest
branch
*NL*
of
the
creation
!
For
no
woman
,
sure
,
will
plead
the
passion
of
love
*NL*
for
an
excuse
.
This
would
be
to
own
herself
the
mere
tool
and
bubble
*NL*
of
the
man
.
Love
,
however
barbarously
we
may
corrupt
and
pervert
its
*NL*
meaning
,
as
it
is
a
laudable
,
is
a
rational
passion
,
and
can
never
be
*NL*
violent
but
when
reciprocal
;
for
though
the
Scripture
bids
us
love
our
*NL*
enemies
,
it
means
not
with
that
fervent
love
which
we
naturally
bear
*NL*
towards
our
friends
;
much
less
that
we
should
sacrifice
to
them
our
*NL*
lives
,
and
what
ought
to
be
dearer
to
us
,
our
innocence
.
Now
in
what
*NL*
light
,
but
that
of
an
enemy
,
can
a
reasonable
woman
regard
the
man
who
*NL*
solicits
her
to
entail
on
herself
all
the
misery
I
have
described
to
*NL*
you
,
and
who
would
purchase
to
himself
a
short
,
trivial
,
contemptible
*NL*
pleasure
,
so
greatly
at
her
expense
!
For
,
by
the
laws
of
custom
,
the
*NL*
whole
shame
,
with
all
its
dreadful
consequences
,
falls
intirely
upon
*NL*
her
.
Can
love
,
which
always
seeks
the
good
of
its
object
,
attempt
to
*NL*
betray
a
woman
into
a
bargain
where
she
is
so
greatly
to

If
such
corrupter
,
therefore
,
should
have
the
impudence
to
pretend
a
*NL*
real
affection
for
her

ought
not
the
woman
to
regard
him
not
only
as
*NL*
an
enemy
,
but
as
the
worst
of
all
enemies
,
a
false
,
designing
,
*NL*
treacherous
,
pretended
friend
,
who
intends
not
only
to
debauch
her

body
,
but
her
understanding
at

*NL*
Here
Jenny
expressing
great
concern
,
Allworthy
paused
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
then
proceeded
:
``
I
have
talked
thus
to
you
,
child
,
not
to
insult
you
*NL*
for
what
is
past
and
irrevocable
,
but
to
caution
and
strengthen
you
*NL*
for
the
future
.
Nor
should
I
have
taken
this
trouble
,
but
from
some
*NL*
opinion
of
your
good
sense
,
notwithstanding
the
dreadful
slip
you
have
*NL*
made
;
and
from
some
hopes
of
your
hearty
repentance
,
which
are
founded
*NL*
on
the
openness
and
sincerity
of
your
confession
.
If
these
do
not
*NL*
deceive
me
,
I
will
take
care
to
convey
you
from
this
scene
of
your
*NL*
shame
,
where
you
shall
,
by
being
unknown
,
avoid
the
punishment
which
,
*NL*
as
I
have
said
,
is
allotted
to
your
crime
in
this
world
;
and
I
hope
,
*NL*
by
repentance
,
you
will
avoid
the
much
heavier
sentence
denounced
*NL*
against
it
in
the
other
.
Be
a
good
girl
the
rest
of
your
days
,
and
*NL*
want
shall
be
no
motive
to
your
going
astray
;
and
,
believe
me
,
there
*NL*
is
more
pleasure
,
even
in
this
world
,
in
an
innocent
and
virtuous
*NL*
life
,
than
in
one
debauched
and
vicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
your
child
,
let
no
thoughts
concerning
it
molest
you
;
I
will
*NL*
provide
for
it
in
a
better
manner
than
you
can
ever
hope
.
And
now
*NL*
nothing
remains
but
that
you
inform
me
who
was
the
wicked
man
that
*NL*
seduced
you
;
for
my
anger
against
him
will
be
much
greater
than
you
*NL*
have
experienced
on
this
occasion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jenny
now
lifted
her
eyes
from
the
ground
,
and
with
a
modest
look
and
*NL*
decent
voice
thus
began
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
know
you
,
sir
,
and
not
love
your
goodness
,
would
be
an
argument
of
*NL*
total
want
of
sense
or
goodness
in
any
one
.
In
me
it
would
amount
to
*NL*
the
highest
ingratitude
,
not
to
feel
,
in
the
most
sensible
manner
,
the
*NL*
great
degree
of
goodness
you
have
been
pleased
to
exert
on
this
*NL*
occasion
.
As
to
my
concern
for
what
is
past
,
I
know
you
will
spare
my
*NL*
blushes
the
repetition
.
My
future
conduct
will
much
better
declare
my
*NL*
sentiments
than
any
professions
I
can
now
make
.
I
beg
leave
to
assure
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
that
I
take
your
advice
much
kinder
than
your
generous
offer
*NL*
with
which
you
concluded
it
;
for
,
as
you
are
pleased
to
say
,
sir
,
it
*NL*
is
an
instance
of
your
opinion
of
my
understanding
.
''
--
Here
her
tears
*NL*
flowing
apace
,
she
stopped
a
few
moments
,
and
then
proceeded
*NL*
thus
:
--
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
your
kindness
overcomes
me
;
but
I
will
endeavour
*NL*
to
deserve
this
good
opinion
:
for
if
I
have
the
understanding
you
are
*NL*
so
kindly
pleased
to
allow
me
,
such
advice
can
not
be
thrown
away
upon
*NL*
me
.
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
heartily
,
for
your
intended
kindness
to
my
poor
*NL*
helpless
child
:
he
is
innocent
,
and
I
hope
will
live
to
be
grateful
*NL*
for
all
the
favours
you
shall
show
him
.
But
now
,
sir
,
I
must
on
my
*NL*
knees
entreat
you
not
to
persist
in
asking
me
to
declare
the
father
of
*NL*
my
infant
.
I
promise
you
faithfully
you
shall
one
day
know
;
but
I
am
*NL*
under
the
most
solemn
ties
and
engagements
of
honour
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
most
religious
vows
and
protestations
,
to
conceal
his
name
at
this
*NL*
time
.
And
I
know
you
too
well
,
to
think
you
would
desire
I
should
*NL*
sacrifice
either
my
honour
or
my
religion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
,
whom
the
least
mention
of
those
sacred
words
was
*NL*
sufficient
to
stagger
,
hesitated
a
moment
before
he
replied
,
and
then
*NL*
told
her
,
she
had
done
wrong
to
enter
into
such
engagements
to
a
*NL*
villain
;
but
since
she
had
,
he
could
not
insist
on
her
breaking
them
.
*NL*
He
said
,
it
was
not
from
a
motive
of
vain
curiosity
he
had
inquired
,
*NL*
but
in
order
to
punish
the
fellow
;
at
least
,
that
he
might
not
*NL*
ignorantly
confer
favours
on
the
undeserving
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
these
points
,
Jenny
satisfied
him
by
the
most
solemn
assurances
,
*NL*
that
the
man
was
entirely
out
of
his
reach
;
and
was
neither
subject
to
*NL*
his
power
,
nor
in
any
probability
of
becoming
an
object
of
his
*NL*
goodness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ingenuity
of
this
behaviour
had
gained
Jenny
so
much
credit
with
*NL*
this
worthy
man
,
that
he
easily
believed
what
she
told
him
;
for
as
she
*NL*
had
disdained
to
excuse
herself
by
a
lie
,
and
had
hazarded
his
further
*NL*
displeasure
in
her
present
situation
,
rather
than
she
would
forfeit
*NL*
her
honour
or
integrity
by
betraying
another
,
he
had
but
little
*NL*
apprehensions
that
she
would
be
guilty
of
falsehood
towards
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
therefore
dismissed
her
with
assurances
that
he
would
very
soon
*NL*
remove
her
out
of
the
reach
of
that
obloquy
she
had
incurred
;
*NL*
concluding
with
some
additional
documents
,
in
which
he
recommended
*NL*
repentance
,
saying
,
``
Consider
,
child
,
there
is
one
still
to
reconcile
*NL*
yourself
to
,
whose
favour
is
of
much
greater
importance
to
you
than
*NL*
mine

Chapter
viii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dialogue
between
Mesdames
Bridget
and
Deborah
;
containing
more
*NL*
amusement
,
but
less
instruction
,
than
the
former
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr
Allworthy
had
retired
to
his
study
with
Jenny
Jones
,
as
hath
*NL*
been
seen
,
Mrs
Bridget
,
with
the
good
housekeeper
,
had
betaken
*NL*
themselves
to
a
post
next
adjoining
to
the
said
study
;
whence
,
through
*NL*
the
conveyance
of
a
keyhole
,
they
sucked
in
at
their
ears
the
*NL*
instructive
lecture
delivered
by
Mr
Allworthy
,
together
with
the
*NL*
answers
of
Jenny
,
and
indeed
every
other
particular
which
passed
in
*NL*
the
last
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
hole
in
her
brother
's
study-door
was
indeed
as
well
known
to
Mrs
*NL*
Bridget
,
and
had
been
as
frequently
applied
to
by
her
,
as
the
famous
*NL*
hole
in
the
wall
was
by
Thisbe
of
old
.
This
served
to
many
good
*NL*
purposes
.
For
by
such
means
Mrs
Bridget
became
often
acquainted
with
*NL*
her
brother
's
inclinations
,
without
giving
him
the
trouble
of
*NL*
repeating
them
to
her
.
It
is
true
,
some
inconveniences
attended
this
*NL*
intercourse
,
and
she
had
sometimes
reason
to
cry
out
with
Thisbe
,
in
*NL*
Shakspeare
,
``
O
,
wicked
,
wicked
wall
!
''
For
as
Mr
Allworthy
was
a
*NL*
justice
of
peace
,
certain
things
occurred
in
examinations
concerning
*NL*
bastards
,
and
such
like
,
which
are
apt
to
give
great
offence
to
the
*NL*
chaste
ears
of
virgins
,
especially
when
they
approach
the
age
of
*NL*
forty
,
as
was
the
case
of
Mrs
Bridget
.
However
,
she
had
,
on
such
*NL*
occasions
,
the
advantage
of
concealing
her
blushes
from
the
eyes
of
*NL*
men
;
and
_
De
non
apparentibus
,
et
non
existentibus
eadem
est
*NL*
ratio
_
--
in
English
,
``
When
a
woman
is
not
seen
to
blush
,
she
doth
not
*NL*
blush
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
the
good
women
kept
strict
silence
during
the
whole
scene
between
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
and
the
girl
;
but
as
soon
as
it
was
ended
,
and
that
*NL*
gentleman
was
out
of
hearing
,
Mrs
Deborah
could
not
help
exclaiming
*NL*
against
the
clemency
of
her
master
,
and
especially
against
his
*NL*
suffering
her
to
conceal
the
father
of
the
child
,
which
she
swore
she
*NL*
would
have
out
of
her
before
the
sun
set
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
Mrs
Bridget
discomposed
her
features
with
a
smile
-LRB-
a
*NL*
thing
very
unusual
to
her
-RRB-
.
Not
that
I
would
have
my
reader
imagine
,
*NL*
that
this
was
one
of
those
wanton
smiles
which
Homer
would
have
you
*NL*
conceive
came
from
Venus
,
when
he
calls
her
the
laughter-loving
*NL*
goddess
;
nor
was
it
one
of
those
smiles
which
Lady
Seraphina
shoots
*NL*
from
the
stage-box
,
and
which
Venus
would
quit
her
immortality
to
be
*NL*
able
to
equal
.
No
,
this
was
rather
one
of
those
smiles
which
might
be
*NL*
supposed
to
have
come
from
the
dimpled
cheeks
of
the
august
Tisiphone
,
*NL*
or
from
one
of
the
misses
,
her
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
a
smile
then
,
and
with
a
voice
sweet
as
the
evening
breeze
*NL*
of
Boreas
in
the
pleasant
month
of
November
,
Mrs
Bridget
gently
*NL*
reproved
the
curiosity
of
Mrs
Deborah
;
a
vice
with
which
it
seems
the
*NL*
latter
was
too
much
tainted
,
and
which
the
former
inveighed
against
*NL*
with
great
bitterness
,
adding
,
``
That
,
among
all
her
faults
,
she
*NL*
thanked
Heaven
her
enemies
could
not
accuse
her
of
prying
into
the
*NL*
affairs
of
other
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
proceeded
to
commend
the
honour
and
spirit
with
which
Jenny
*NL*
had
acted
.
She
said
,
she
could
not
help
agreeing
with
her
brother
,
*NL*
that
there
was
some
merit
in
the
sincerity
of
her
confession
,
and
in
*NL*
her
integrity
to
her
lover
:
that
she
had
always
thought
her
a
very
*NL*
good
girl
,
and
doubted
not
but
she
had
been
seduced
by
some
rascal
,
*NL*
who
had
been
infinitely
more
to
blame
than
herself
,
and
very
probably
*NL*
had
prevailed
with
her
by
a
promise
of
marriage
,
or
some
other
*NL*
treacherous
proceeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
behaviour
of
Mrs
Bridget
greatly
surprised
Mrs
Deborah
;
for
this
*NL*
well-bred
woman
seldom
opened
her
lips
,
either
to
her
master
or
his
*NL*
sister
,
till
she
had
first
sounded
their
inclinations
,
with
which
her
*NL*
sentiments
were
always
consonant
.
Here
,
however
,
she
thought
she
might
*NL*
have
launched
forth
with
safety
;
and
the
sagacious
reader
will
not
*NL*
perhaps
accuse
her
of
want
of
sufficient
forecast
in
so
doing
,
but
*NL*
will
rather
admire
with
what
wonderful
celerity
she
tacked
about
,
when
*NL*
she
found
herself
steering
a
wrong
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
madam
,
''
said
this
able
woman
,
and
truly
great
politician
,
``
I
*NL*
must
own
I
can
not
help
admiring
the
girl
's
spirit
,
as
well
as
your
*NL*
ladyship
.
And
,
as
your
ladyship
says
,
if
she
was
deceived
by
some
*NL*
wicked
man
,
the
poor
wretch
is
to
be
pitied
.
And
to
be
sure
,
as
your
*NL*
ladyship
says
,
the
girl
hath
always
appeared
like
a
good
,
honest
,
*NL*
plain
girl
,
and
not
vain
of
her
face
,
forsooth
,
as
some
wanton
husseys
*NL*
in
the
neighbourhood
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
true
,
Deborah
,
''
said
Miss
Bridget
.
``
If
the
girl
had
been
one
*NL*
of
those
vain
trollops
,
of
which
we
have
too
many
in
the
parish
,
I
*NL*
should
have
condemned
my
brother
for
his
lenity
towards
her
.
I
saw
two
*NL*
farmers
'
daughters
at
church
,
the
other
day
,
with
bare
necks
.
I
*NL*
protest
they
shocked
me
.
If
wenches
will
hang
out
lures
for
fellows
,
*NL*
it
is
no
matter
what
they
suffer
.
I
detest
such
creatures
;
and
it
*NL*
would
be
much
better
for
them
that
their
faces
had
been
seamed
with
*NL*
the
smallpox
;
but
I
must
confess
,
I
never
saw
any
of
this
wanton
*NL*
behaviour
in
poor
Jenny
:
some
artful
villain
,
I
am
convinced
,
hath
*NL*
betrayed
,
nay
perhaps
forced
her
;
and
I
pity
the
poor
wretch
with
all
*NL*
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Deborah
approved
all
these
sentiments
,
and
the
dialogue
concluded
*NL*
with
a
general
and
bitter
invective
against
beauty
,
and
with
many
*NL*
compassionate
considerations
for
all
honest
plain
girls
who
are
*NL*
deluded
by
the
wicked
arts
of
deceitful
men

Containing
matters

*NL*
Jenny
returned
home
well
pleased
with
the
reception
she
had
met
with
*NL*
from
Mr
Allworthy
,
whose
indulgence
to
her
she
industriously
made
*NL*
public
;
partly
perhaps
as
a
sacrifice
to
her
own
pride
,
and
partly
*NL*
from
the
more
prudent
motive
of
reconciling
her
neighbours
to
her
,
and
*NL*
silencing
their
clamours
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
this
latter
view
,
if
she
indeed
had
it
,
may
appear
*NL*
reasonable
enough
,
yet
the
event
did
not
answer
her
expectation
;
for
*NL*
when
she
was
convened
before
the
justice
,
and
it
was
universally
*NL*
apprehended
that
the
house
of
correction
would
have
been
her
fate
,
*NL*
though
some
of
the
young
women
cryed
out
``
It
was
good
enough
for
her
,
''
*NL*
and
diverted
themselves
with
the
thoughts
of
her
beating
hemp
in
a
*NL*
silk
gown
;
yet
there
were
many
others
who
began
to
pity
her
condition
:
*NL*
but
when
it
was
known
in
what
manner
Mr
Allworthy
had
behaved
,
the
*NL*
tide
turned
against
her
.
One
said
,
``
I
'll
assure
you
,
madam
hath
had
*NL*
good
luck
.
''
A
second
cryed
,
``
See
what
it
is
to
be
a
favourite
!
''
A
*NL*
third
,
``
Ay
,
this
comes
of
her
learning
.
''
Every
person
made
some
*NL*
malicious
comment
or
other
on
the
occasion
,
and
reflected
on
the
*NL*
partiality
of
the
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
behaviour
of
these
people
may
appear
impolitic
and
ungrateful
to
*NL*
the
reader
,
who
considers
the
power
and
benevolence
of
Mr
Allworthy
.
*NL*
But
as
to
his
power
,
he
never
used
it
;
and
as
to
his
benevolence
,
he
*NL*
exerted
so
much
,
that
he
had
thereby
disobliged
all
his
neighbours
;
*NL*
for
it
is
a
secret
well
known
to
great
men
,
that
,
by
conferring
an
*NL*
obligation
,
they
do
not
always
procure
a
friend
,
but
are
certain
of
*NL*
creating
many
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jenny
was
,
however
,
by
the
care
and
goodness
of
Mr
Allworthy
,
soon
*NL*
removed
out
of
the
reach
of
reproach
;
when
malice
being
no
longer
able
*NL*
to
vent
its
rage
on
her
,
began
to
seek
another
object
of
its
*NL*
bitterness
,
and
this
was
no
less
than
Mr
Allworthy
,
himself
;
for
a
*NL*
whisper
soon
went
abroad
,
that
he
himself
was
the
father
of
the
*NL*
foundling
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
supposition
so
well
reconciled
his
conduct
to
the
general
*NL*
opinion
,
that
it
met
with
universal
assent
;
and
the
outcry
against
his
*NL*
lenity
soon
began
to
take
another
turn
,
and
was
changed
into
an
*NL*
invective
against
his
cruelty
to
the
poor
girl
.
Very
grave
and
good
*NL*
women
exclaimed
against
men
who
begot
children
,
and
then
disowned
*NL*
them
.
Nor
were
there
wanting
some
,
who
,
after
the
departure
of
Jenny
,
*NL*
insinuated
that
she
was
spirited
away
with
a
design
too
black
to
be
*NL*
mentioned
,
and
who
gave
frequent
hints
that
a
legal
inquiry
ought
to
*NL*
be
made
into
the
whole
matter
,
and
that
some
people
should
be
forced
*NL*
to
produce
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
calumnies
might
have
probably
produced
ill
consequences
,
at
the
*NL*
least
might
have
occasioned
some
trouble
,
to
a
person
of
a
more
*NL*
doubtful
and
suspicious
character
than
Mr
Allworthy
was
blessed
with
;
*NL*
but
in
his
case
they
had
no
such
effect
;
and
,
being
heartily
despised
*NL*
by
him
,
they
served
only
to
afford
an
innocent
amusement
to
the
good
*NL*
gossips
of
the
neighbourhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
we
can
not
possibly
divine
what
complection
our
reader
may
be
*NL*
of
,
and
as
it
will
be
some
time
before
he
will
hear
any
more
of
Jenny
,
*NL*
we
think
proper
to
give
him
a
very
early
intimation
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
*NL*
was
,
and
will
hereafter
appear
to
be
,
absolutely
innocent
of
any
*NL*
criminal
intention
whatever
.
He
had
indeed
committed
no
other
than
an
*NL*
error
in
politics
,
by
tempering
justice
with
mercy
,
and
by
refusing
to
*NL*
gratify
the
good-natured
disposition
of
the
mob
,
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
with
an
object
for
*NL*
their
compassion
to
work
on
in
the
person
of
poor
Jenny
,
whom
,
in
*NL*
order
to
pity
,
they
desired
to
have
seen
sacrificed
to
ruin
and
*NL*
infamy
,
by
a
shameful
correction
in
Bridewell
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-

-RSB-
Whenever
this
word
occurs
in
our
writings
,
it
intends
persons
*NL*
without
virtue
or
sense
,
in
all
stations
;
and
many
of
the
highest
*NL*
rank
are
often
meant
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
from
complying
with
this
their
inclination
,
by
which
all
hopes
*NL*
of
reformation
would
have
been
abolished
,
and
even
the
gate
shut
*NL*
against
her
if
her
own
inclinations
should
ever
hereafter
lead
her
to
*NL*
chuse
the
road
of
virtue
,
Mr
Allworthy
rather
chose
to
encourage
the
*NL*
girl
to
return
thither
by
the
only
possible
means
;
for
too
true
I
am
*NL*
afraid
it
is
,
that
many
women
have
become
abandoned
,
and
have
sunk
to
*NL*
the
last
degree
of
vice
,
by
being
unable
to
retrieve
the
first
slip
.
*NL*
This
will
be
,
I
am
afraid
,
always
the
case
while
they
remain
among
*NL*
their
former
acquaintance
;
it
was
therefore
wisely
done
by
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
to
remove
Jenny
to
a
place
where
she
might
enjoy
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
reputation
,
after
having
tasted
the
ill
consequences
of
*NL*
losing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
place
therefore
,
wherever
it
was
,
we
will
wish
her
a
good
*NL*
journey
,
and
for
the
present
take
leave
of
her
,
and
of
the
little
*NL*
foundling
her
child
,
having
matters
of
much
higher
importance
to
*NL*
communicate
to
the
reader
.

Chapter

.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hospitality
of
Allworthy
;
with
a
short
sketch
of
the
characters
of
*NL*
two
brothers
,
a
doctor
and
a
captain
,
who
were
entertained
by
that
*NL*
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
,
nor
his
heart
,
were
shut
against
any
*NL*
part
of
mankind
,
but
they
were
both
more
particularly
open
to
men
of
*NL*
merit
.
To
say
the
truth
,
this
was
the
only
house
in
the
kingdom
where
*NL*
you
was
sure
to
gain
a
dinner
by
deserving
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Above
all
others
,
men
of
genius
and
learning
shared
the
principal
*NL*
place
in
his
favour
;
and
in
these
he
had
much
discernment
:
for
though
*NL*
he
had
missed
the
advantage
of
a
learned
education
,
yet
,
being
blest
*NL*
with
vast
natural
abilities
,
he
had
so
well
profited
by
a
vigorous
*NL*
though
late
application
to
letters
,
and
by
much
conversation
with
men
*NL*
of
eminence
in
this
way
,
that
he
was
himself
a
very
competent
judge
in
*NL*
most
kinds
of
literature
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
no
wonder
that
in
an
age
when
this
kind
of
merit
is
so
little
in
*NL*
fashion
,
and
so
slenderly
provided
for
,
persons
possessed
of
it
should
*NL*
very
eagerly
flock
to
a
place
where
they
were
sure
of
being
received
*NL*
with
great
complaisance
;
indeed
,
where
they
might
enjoy
almost
the
*NL*
same
advantages
of
a
liberal
fortune
as
if
they
were
entitled
to
it
in
*NL*
their
own
right
;
for
Mr
Allworthy
was
not
one
of
those
generous
*NL*
persons
who
are
ready
most
bountifully
to
bestow
meat
,
drink
,
and
*NL*
lodging
on
men
of
wit
and
learning
,
for
which
they
expect
no
other
*NL*
return
but
entertainment
,
instruction
,
flattery
,
and
subserviency
;
in
*NL*
a
word
,
that
such
persons
should
be
enrolled
in
the
number
of
*NL*
domestics
,
without
wearing
their
master
's
cloathes
,
or
receiving
*NL*
wages
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
every
person
in
this
house
was
perfect
master
of
his
*NL*
own
time
:
and
as
he
might
at
his
pleasure
satisfy
all
his
appetites
*NL*
within
the
restrictions
only
of
law
,
virtue
,
and
religion
;
so
he
*NL*
might
,
if
his
health
required
,
or
his
inclination
prompted
him
to
*NL*
temperance
,
or
even
to
abstinence
,
absent
himself
from
any
meals
,
or
*NL*
retire
from
them
,
whenever
he
was
so
disposed
,
without
even
a
*NL*
sollicitation
to
the
contrary
:
for
,
indeed
,
such
sollicitations
from
*NL*
superiors
always
savour
very
strongly
of
commands
.
But
all
here
were
*NL*
free
from
such
impertinence
,
not
only
those
whose
company
is
in
all
*NL*
other
places
esteemed
a
favour
from
their
equality
of
fortune
,
but
*NL*
even
those
whose
indigent
circumstances
make
such
an
eleemosynary
*NL*
abode
convenient
to
them
,
and
who
are
therefore
less
welcome
to
a
*NL*
great
man
's
table
because
they
stand
in
need
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
others
of
this
kind
was
Dr
Blifil
,
a
gentleman
who
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
of
losing
the
advantage
of
great
talents
by
the
obstinacy
*NL*
of
a
father
,
who
would
breed
him
to
a
profession
he
disliked
.
In
*NL*
obedience
to
this
obstinacy
the
doctor
had
in
his
youth
been
obliged
*NL*
to
study
physic
,
or
rather
to
say
he
studied
it
;
for
in
reality
books
*NL*
of
this
kind
were
almost
the
only
ones
with
which
he
was
unacquainted
;
*NL*
and
unfortunately
for
him
,
the
doctor
was
master
of
almost
every
other
*NL*
science
but
that
by
which
he
was
to
get
his
bread
;
the
consequence
of
*NL*
which
was
,
that
the
doctor
at
the
age
of
forty
had
no
bread
to
eat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
person
as
this
was
certain
to
find
a
welcome
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
*NL*
table
,
to
whom
misfortunes
were
ever
a
recommendation
,
when
they
were
*NL*
derived
from
the
folly
or
villany
of
others
,
and
not
of
the
*NL*
unfortunate
person
himself
.
Besides
this
negative
merit
,
the
doctor
*NL*
had
one
positive
recommendation
;
--
this
was
a
great
appearance
of
*NL*
religion
.
Whether
his
religion
was
real
,
or
consisted
only
in
*NL*
appearance
,
I
shall
not
presume
to
say
,
as
I
am
not
possessed
of
any
*NL*
touchstone
which
can
distinguish
the
true
from
the
false
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
this
part
of
his
character
pleased
Mr
Allworthy
,
it
delighted
Miss
*NL*
Bridget
.
She
engaged
him
in
many
religious
controversies
;
on
which
*NL*
occasions
she
constantly
expressed
great
satisfaction
in
the
doctor
's
*NL*
knowledge
,
and
not
much
less
in
the
compliments
which
he
frequently
*NL*
bestowed
on
her
own
.
To
say
the
truth
,
she
had
read
much
English
*NL*
divinity
,
and
had
puzzled
more
than
one
of
the
neighbouring
curates
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
her
conversation
was
so
pure
,
her
looks
so
sage
,
and
her
whole
*NL*
deportment
so
grave
and
solemn
,
that
she
seemed
to
deserve
the
name
of
*NL*
saint
equally
with
her
namesake
,
or
with
any
other
female
in
the
Roman
*NL*
kalendar
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
sympathies
of
all
kinds
are
apt
to
beget
love
,
so
experience
*NL*
teaches
us
that
none
have
a
more
direct
tendency
this
way
than
those
*NL*
of
a
religious
kind
between
persons
of
different
sexes
.
The
doctor
*NL*
found
himself
so
agreeable
to
Miss
Bridget
,
that
he
now
began
to
*NL*
lament
an
unfortunate
accident
which
had
happened
to
him
about
ten
*NL*
years
before
;
namely
,
his
marriage
with
another
woman
,
who
was
not
*NL*
only
still
alive
,
but
,
what
was
worse
,
known
to
be
so
by
Mr
Allworthy
.
*NL*
This
was
a
fatal
bar
to
that
happiness
which
he
otherwise
saw
*NL*
sufficient
probability
of
obtaining
with
this
young
lady
;
for
as
to
*NL*
criminal
indulgences
,
he
certainly
never
thought
of
them
.
This
was
*NL*
owing
either
to
his
religion
,
as
is
most
probable
,
or
to
the
purity
of
*NL*
his
passion
,
which
was
fixed
on
those
things
which
matrimony
only
,
and
*NL*
not
criminal
correspondence
,
could
put
him
in
possession
of
,
or
could
*NL*
give
him
any
title
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
long
ruminated
on
these
matters
,
before
it
occurred
to
his
*NL*
memory
that
he
had
a
brother
who
was
under
no
such
unhappy
incapacity
.
*NL*
This
brother
he
made
no
doubt
would
succeed
;
for
he
discerned
,
as
he
*NL*
thought
,
an
inclination
to
marriage
in
the
lady
;
and
the
reader
*NL*
perhaps
,
when
he
hears
the
brother
's
qualifications
,
will
not
blame
*NL*
the
confidence
which
he
entertained
of
his
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gentleman
was
about
thirty-five
years
of
age
.
He
was
of
a
middle
*NL*
size
,
and
what
is
called
well-built
.
He
had
a
scar
on
his
forehead
,
*NL*
which
did
not
so
much
injure
his
beauty
as
it
denoted
his
valour
-LRB-
for
*NL*
he
was
a
half-pay
officer
-RRB-
.
He
had
good
teeth
,
and
something
affable
,
*NL*
when
he
pleased
,
in
his
smile
;
though
naturally
his
countenance
,
as
*NL*
well
as
his
air
and
voice
,
had
much
of
roughness
in
it
:
yet
he
could
*NL*
at
any
time
deposit
this
,
and
appear
all
gentleness
and
good-humour
.
*NL*
He
was
not
ungenteel
,
nor
entirely
devoid
of
wit
,
and
in
his
youth
had
*NL*
abounded
in
sprightliness
,
which
,
though
he
had
lately
put
on
a
more
*NL*
serious
character
,
he
could
,
when
he
pleased
,
resume
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
as
well
as
the
doctor
,
an
academic
education
;
for
his
father
*NL*
had
,
with
the
same
paternal
authority
we
have
mentioned
before
,
*NL*
decreed
him
for
holy
orders
;
but
as
the
old
gentleman
died
before
he
*NL*
was
ordained
,
he
chose
the
church
military
,
and
preferred
the
king
's
*NL*
commission
to
the
bishop
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
purchased
the
post
of
lieutenant
of
dragoons
,
and
afterwards
*NL*
came
to
be
a
captain
;
but
having
quarrelled
with
his
colonel
,
was
by
*NL*
his
interest
obliged
to
sell
;
from
which
time
he
had
entirely
*NL*
rusticated
himself
,
had
betaken
himself
to
studying
the
Scriptures
,
*NL*
and
was
not
a
little
suspected
of
an
inclination
to
methodism
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
,
therefore
,
not
unlikely
that
such
a
person
should
succeed
*NL*
with
a
lady
of
so
saint-like
a
disposition
,
and
whose
inclinations
*NL*
were
no
otherwise
engaged
than
to
the
marriage
state
in
general
;
but
*NL*
why
the
doctor
,
who
certainly
had
no
great
friendship
for
his
brother
,
*NL*
should
for
his
sake
think
of
making
so
ill
a
return
to
the
hospitality
*NL*
of
Allworthy
,
is
a
matter
not
so
easy
to
be
accounted
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
it
that
some
natures
delight
in
evil
,
as
others
are
thought
to
*NL*
delight
in
virtue
?
Or
is
there
a
pleasure
in
being
accessory
to
a
*NL*
theft
when
we
can
not
commit
it
ourselves
?
Or
lastly
-LRB-
which
experience
*NL*
seems
to
make
probable
-RRB-
,
have
we
a
satisfaction
in
aggrandizing
our
*NL*
families
,
even
though
we
have
not
the
least
love
or
respect
for
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
any
of
these
motives
operated
on
the
doctor
,
we
will
not
*NL*
determine
;
but
so
the
fact
was
.
He
sent
for
his
brother
,
and
easily
*NL*
found
means
to
introduce
him
at
Allworthy
's
as
a
person
who
intended
*NL*
only
a
short
visit
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
had
not
been
in
the
house
a
week
before
the
doctor
had
*NL*
reason
to
felicitate
himself
on
his
discernment
.
The
captain
was
*NL*
indeed
as
great
a
master
of
the
art
of
love
as
Ovid
was
formerly
.
He
*NL*
had
besides
received
proper
hints
from
his
brother
,
which
he
failed
*NL*
not
to
improve
to
the
best
advantage
.

Containing
many
rules
,
and
some
examples
,
concerning
falling
in
love
:
*NL*
descriptions
of
beauty
,
and
other
more
prudential
inducements
to
*NL*
matrimony
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
hath
been
observed
,
by
wise
men
or
women
,
I
forget
which
,
that
all
*NL*
persons
are
doomed
to
be
in
love
once
in
their
lives
.
No
particular
*NL*
season
is
,
as
I
remember
,
assigned
for
this
;
but
the
age
at
which
Miss
*NL*
Bridget
was
arrived
,
seems
to
me
as
proper
a
period
as
any
to
be
fixed
*NL*
on
for
this
purpose
:
it
often
,
indeed
,
happens
much
earlier
;
but
when
*NL*
it
doth
not
,
I
have
observed
it
seldom
or
never
fails
about
this
time
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
we
may
remark
that
at
this
season
love
is
of
a
more
serious
*NL*
and
steady
nature
than
what
sometimes
shows
itself
in
the
younger
*NL*
parts
of
life
.
The
love
of
girls
is
uncertain
,
capricious
,
and
so
*NL*
foolish
that
we
can
not
always
discover
what
the
young
lady
would
be
*NL*
at
;
nay
,
it
may
almost
be
doubted
whether
she
always
knows
this
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
we
are
never
at
a
loss
to
discern
this
in
women
about
forty
;
for
*NL*
as
such
grave
,
serious
,
and
experienced
ladies
well
know
their
own
*NL*
meaning
,
so
it
is
always
very
easy
for
a
man
of
the
least
sagacity
to
*NL*
discover
it
with
the
utmost
certainty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bridget
is
an
example
of
all
these
observations
.
She
had
not
been
*NL*
many
times
in
the
captain
's
company
before
she
was
seized
with
this
*NL*
passion
.
Nor
did
she
go
pining
and
moping
about
the
house
,
like
a
*NL*
puny
,
foolish
girl
,
ignorant
of
her
distemper
:
she
felt
,
she
knew
,
and
*NL*
she
enjoyed
,
the
pleasing
sensation
,
of
which
,
as
she
was
certain
it
*NL*
was
not
only
innocent
but
laudable
,
she
was
neither
afraid
nor
*NL*
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
to
say
the
truth
,
there
is
,
in
all
points
,
great
difference
*NL*
between
the
reasonable
passion
which
women
at
this
age
conceive
*NL*
towards
men
,
and
the
idle
and
childish
liking
of
a
girl
to
a
boy
,
*NL*
which
is
often
fixed
on
the
outside
only
,
and
on
things
of
little
*NL*
value
and
no
duration
;
as
on
cherry-cheeks
,
small
,
lily-white
hands
,
*NL*
sloe-black
eyes
,
flowing
locks
,
downy
chins
,
dapper
shapes
;
nay
,
*NL*
sometimes
on
charms
more
worthless
than
these
,
and
less
the
party
's
*NL*
own
;
such
are
the
outward
ornaments
of
the
person
,
for
which
men
are
*NL*
beholden
to
the
taylor
,
the
laceman
,
the
periwig-maker
,
the
hatter
,
*NL*
and
the
milliner
,
and
not
to
nature
.
Such
a
passion
girls
may
well
be
*NL*
ashamed
,
as
they
generally
are
,
to
own
either
to
themselves
or
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
love
of
Miss
Bridget
was
of
another
kind
.
The
captain
owed
nothing
*NL*
to
any
of
these
fop-makers
in
his
dress
,
nor
was
his
person
much
more
*NL*
beholden
to
nature
.
Both
his
dress
and
person
were
such
as
,
had
they
*NL*
appeared
in
an
assembly
or
a
drawing-room
,
would
have
been
the
*NL*
contempt
and
ridicule
of
all
the
fine
ladies
there
.
The
former
of
*NL*
these
was
indeed
neat
,
but
plain
,
coarse
,
ill-fancied
,
and
out
of
*NL*
fashion
.
As
for
the
latter
,
we
have
expressly
described
it
above
.
So
*NL*
far
was
the
skin
on
his
cheeks
from
being
cherry-coloured
,
that
you
*NL*
could
not
discern
what
the
natural
colour
of
his
cheeks
was
,
they
*NL*
being
totally
overgrown
by
a
black
beard
,
which
ascended
to
his
eyes
.
*NL*
His
shape
and
limbs
were
indeed
exactly
proportioned
,
but
so
large
*NL*
that
they
denoted
the
strength
rather
of
a
ploughman
than
any
other
.
*NL*
His
shoulders
were
broad
beyond
all
size
,
and
the
calves
of
his
legs
*NL*
larger
than
those
of
a
common
chairman
.
In
short
,
his
whole
person
*NL*
wanted
all
that
elegance
and
beauty
which
is
the
very
reverse
of
*NL*
clumsy
strength
,
and
which
so
agreeably
sets
off
most
of
our
fine
*NL*
gentlemen
;
being
partly
owing
to
the
high
blood
of
their
ancestors
,
*NL*
viz.
,
blood
made
of
rich
sauces
and
generous
wines
,
and
partly
to
an
*NL*
early
town
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Miss
Bridget
was
a
woman
of
the
greatest
delicacy
of
taste
,
yet
*NL*
such
were
the
charms
of
the
captain
's
conversation
,
that
she
totally
*NL*
overlooked
the
defects
of
his
person
.
She
imagined
,
and
perhaps
very
*NL*
wisely
,
that
she
should
enjoy
more
agreeable
minutes
with
the
captain
*NL*
than
with
a
much
prettier
fellow
;
and
forewent
the
consideration
of
*NL*
pleasing
her
eyes
,
in
order
to
procure
herself
much
more
solid
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
no
sooner
perceived
the
passion
of
Miss
Bridget
,
in
which
*NL*
discovery
he
was
very
quick-sighted
,
than
he
faithfully
returned
it
.
*NL*
The
lady
,
no
more
than
her
lover
,
was
remarkable
for
beauty
.
I
would
*NL*
attempt
to
draw
her
picture
,
but
that
is
done
already
by
a
more
able
*NL*
master
,
Mr
Hogarth
himself
,
to
whom
she
sat
many
years
ago
,
and
hath
*NL*
been
lately
exhibited
by
that
gentleman
in
his
print
of
a
winter
's
*NL*
morning
,
of
which
she
was
no
improper
emblem
,
and
may
be
seen
walking
*NL*
-LRB-
for
walk
she
doth
in
the
print
-RRB-
to
Covent
Garden
church
,
with
a
*NL*
starved
foot-boy
behind
carrying
her
prayer-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
likewise
very
wisely
preferred
the
more
solid
enjoyments
*NL*
he
expected
with
this
lady
,
to
the
fleeting
charms
of
person
.
He
was
*NL*
one
of
those
wise
men
who
regard
beauty
in
the
other
sex
as
a
very
*NL*
worthless
and
superficial
qualification
;
or
,
to
speak
more
truly
,
who
*NL*
rather
chuse
to
possess
every
convenience
of
life
with
an
ugly
woman
,
*NL*
than
a
handsome
one
without
any
of
those
conveniences
.
And
having
a
*NL*
very
good
appetite
,
and
but
little
nicety
,
he
fancied
he
should
play
*NL*
his
part
very
well
at
the
matrimonial
banquet
,
without
the
sauce
of
*NL*
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
deal
plainly
with
the
reader
,
the
captain
,
ever
since
his
arrival
,
*NL*
at
least
from
the
moment
his
brother
had
proposed
the
match
to
him
,
*NL*
long
before
he
had
discovered
any
flattering
symptoms
in
Miss
Bridget
,
*NL*
had
been
greatly
enamoured
;
that
is
to
say
,
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
*NL*
and
gardens
,
and
of
his
lands
,
tenements
,
and
hereditaments
;
of
all
*NL*
which
the
captain
was
so
passionately
fond
,
that
he
would
most
*NL*
probably
have
contracted
marriage
with
them
,
had
he
been
obliged
to
*NL*
have
taken
the
witch
of
Endor
into
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr
Allworthy
,
therefore
,
had
declared
to
the
doctor
that
he
never
*NL*
intended
to
take
a
second
wife
,
as
his
sister
was
his
nearest
*NL*
relation
,
and
as
the
doctor
had
fished
out
that
his
intentions
were
to
*NL*
make
any
child
of
hers
his
heir
,
which
indeed
the
law
,
without
his
*NL*
interposition
,
would
have
done
for
him
;
the
doctor
and
his
brother
*NL*
thought
it
an
act
of
benevolence
to
give
being
to
a
human
creature
,
*NL*
who
would
be
so
plentifully
provided
with
the
most
essential
means
of
*NL*
happiness
.
The
whole
thoughts
,
therefore
,
of
both
the
brothers
were
*NL*
how
to
engage
the
affections
of
this
amiable
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
fortune
,
who
is
a
tender
parent
,
and
often
doth
more
for
her
*NL*
favourite
offspring
than
either
they
deserve
or
wish
,
had
been
so
*NL*
industrious
for
the
captain
,
that
whilst
he
was
laying
schemes
to
*NL*
execute
his
purpose
,
the
lady
conceived
the
same
desires
with
himself
,
*NL*
and
was
on
her
side
contriving
how
to
give
the
captain
proper
*NL*
encouragement
,
without
appearing
too
forward
;
for
she
was
a
strict
*NL*
observer
of
all
rules
of
decorum
.
In
this
,
however
,
she
easily
*NL*
succeeded
;
for
as
the
captain
was
always
on
the
look-out
,
no
glance
,
*NL*
gesture
,
or
word
escaped
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
satisfaction
which
the
captain
received
from
the
kind
behaviour
of
*NL*
Miss
Bridget
,
was
not
a
little
abated
by
his
apprehensions
of
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
;
for
,
notwithstanding
his
disinterested
professions
,
the
*NL*
captain
imagined
he
would
,
when
he
came
to
act
,
follow
the
example
of
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
world
,
and
refuse
his
consent
to
a
match
so
*NL*
disadvantageous
,
in
point
of
interest
,
to
his
sister
.
From
what
oracle
*NL*
he
received
this
opinion
,
I
shall
leave
the
reader
to
determine
:
but
*NL*
however
he
came
by
it
,
it
strangely
perplexed
him
how
to
regulate
his
*NL*
conduct
so
as
at
once
to
convey
his
affection
to
the
lady
,
and
to
*NL*
conceal
it
from
her
brother
.
He
at
length
resolved
to
take
all
private
*NL*
opportunities
of
making
his
addresses
;
but
in
the
presence
of
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
to
be
as
reserved
and
as
much
upon
his
guard
as
was
*NL*
possible
;
and
this
conduct
was
highly
approved
by
the
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
found
means
to
make
his
addresses
,
in
express
terms
,
to
his
*NL*
mistress
,
from
whom
he
received
an
answer
in
the
proper
form
,
viz.
:
*NL*
the
answer
which
was
first
made
some
thousands
of
years
ago
,
and
which
*NL*
hath
been
handed
down
by
tradition
from
mother
to
daughter
ever
since
.
*NL*
If
I
was
to
translate
this
into
Latin
,
I
should
render
it
by
these
two
*NL*
words
,
_
Nolo
Episcopari
_
:
a
phrase
likewise
of
immemorial
use
on
*NL*
another
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
however
he
came
by
his
knowledge
,
perfectly
well
*NL*
understood
the
lady
,
and
very
soon
after
repeated
his
application
with
*NL*
more
warmth
and
earnestness
than
before
,
and
was
again
,
according
to
*NL*
due
form
,
rejected
;
but
as
he
had
increased
in
the
eagerness
of
his
*NL*
desires
,
so
the
lady
,
with
the
same
propriety
,
decreased
in
the
*NL*
violence
of
her
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
to
tire
the
reader
,
by
leading
him
through
every
scene
of
this
*NL*
courtship
-LRB-
which
,
though
in
the
opinion
of
a
certain
great
author
,
it
*NL*
is
the
pleasantest
scene
of
life
to
the
actor
,
is
,
perhaps
,
as
dull
*NL*
and
tiresome
as
any
whatever
to
the
audience
-RRB-
,
the
captain
made
his
*NL*
advances
in
form
,
the
citadel
was
defended
in
form
,
and
at
length
,
in
*NL*
proper
form
,
surrendered
at
discretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
whole
time
,
which
filled
the
space
of
near
a
month
,
the
*NL*
captain
preserved
great
distance
of
behaviour
to
his
lady
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
brother
;
and
the
more
he
succeeded
with
her
in
*NL*
private
,
the
more
reserved
was
he
in
public
.
And
as
for
the
lady
,
she
*NL*
had
no
sooner
secured
her
lover
than
she
behaved
to
him
before
company
*NL*
with
the
highest
degree
of
indifference
;
so
that
Mr
Allworthy
must
*NL*
have
had
the
insight
of
the
devil
-LRB-
or
perhaps
some
of
his
worse
*NL*
qualities
-RRB-
to
have
entertained
the
least
suspicion
of
what
was
going
*NL*
forward
.

marry
,
or
concerning
any
other
*NL*
such
business
,
little
previous
ceremony
is
required
to
bring
the
*NL*
matter
to
an
issue
when
both
parties
are
really
in
earnest
.
This
was
*NL*
the
case
at
present
,
and
in
less
than
a
month
the
captain
and
his
lady
*NL*
were
man
and
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
concern
now
was
to
break
the
matter
to
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
*NL*
this
was
undertaken
by
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
then
,
as
Allworthy
was
walking
in
his
garden
,
the
doctor
came
*NL*
to
him
,
and
,
with
great
gravity
of
aspect
,
and
all
the
concern
which
*NL*
he
could
possibly
affect
in
his
countenance
,
said
,
``
I
am
come
,
sir
,
to
*NL*
impart
an
affair
to
you
of
the
utmost
consequence
;
but
how
shall
I
*NL*
mention
to
you
what
it
almost
distracts
me
to
think
of
!
''
He
then
*NL*
launched
forth
into
the
most
bitter
invectives
both
against
men
and
*NL*
women
;
accusing
the
former
of
having
no
attachment
but
to
their
*NL*
interest
,
and
the
latter
of
being
so
addicted
to
vicious
inclinations
*NL*
that
they
could
never
be
safely
trusted
with
one
of
the
other
sex
.
*NL*
``
Could
I
,
''
said
he
,
``
sir
,
have
suspected
that
a
lady
of
such
prudence
,
*NL*
such
judgment
,
such
learning
,
should
indulge
so
indiscreet
a
passion
!
*NL*
or
could
I
have
imagined
that
my
brother
--
why
do
I
call
him
so
?
he
is
*NL*
no
longer
a
brother
of
mine
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
but
he
is
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
and
a
brother
of
mine
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
,
sir
!
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
do
you
know
the
shocking
affair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
`
ee
,
Mr
Blifil
,
''
answered
the
good
man
,
``
it
hath
been
my
constant
*NL*
maxim
in
life
to
make
the
best
of
all
matters
which
happen
.
My
sister
,
*NL*
though
many
years
younger
than
I
,
is
at
least
old
enough
to
be
at
the
*NL*
age
of
discretion
.
Had
he
imposed
on
a
child
,
I
should
have
been
more
*NL*
averse
to
have
forgiven
him
;
but
a
woman
upwards
of
thirty
must
*NL*
certainly
be
supposed
to
know
what
will
make
her
most
happy
.
She
hath
*NL*
married
a
gentleman
,
though
perhaps
not
quite
her
equal
in
fortune
;
*NL*
and
if
he
hath
any
perfections
in
her
eye
which
can
make
up
that
*NL*
deficiency
,
I
see
no
reason
why
I
should
object
to
her
choice
of
her
*NL*
own
happiness
;
which
I
,
no
more
than
herself
,
imagine
to
consist
only
*NL*
in
immense
wealth
.
I
might
,
perhaps
,
from
the
many
declarations
I
have
*NL*
made
of
complying
with
almost
any
proposal
,
have
expected
to
have
been
*NL*
consulted
on
this
occasion
;
but
these
matters
are
of
a
very
delicate
*NL*
nature
,
and
the
scruples
of
modesty
,
perhaps
,
are
not
to
be
overcome
.
*NL*
As
to
your
brother
,
I
have
really
no
anger
against
him
at
all
.
He
hath
*NL*
no
obligations
to
me
,
nor
do
I
think
he
was
under
any
necessity
of
*NL*
asking
my
consent
,
since
the
woman
is
,
as
I
have
said
,
_
sui
juris
_
,
*NL*
and
of
a
proper
age
to
be
entirely
answerable
only
,
to
herself
for
her
*NL*
conduct
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
accused
Mr
Allworthy
of
too
great
lenity
,
repeated
his
*NL*
accusations
against
his
brother
,
and
declared
that
he
should
never
*NL*
more
be
brought
either
to
see
,
or
to
own
him
for
his
relation
.
He
then
*NL*
launched
forth
into
a
panegyric
on
Allworthy
's
goodness
;
into
the
*NL*
highest
encomiums
on
his
friendship
;
and
concluded
by
saying
,
he
*NL*
should
never
forgive
his
brother
for
having
put
the
place
which
he
*NL*
bore
in
that
friendship
to
a
hazard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
thus
answered
:
``
Had
I
conceived
any
displeasure
against
your
*NL*
brother
,
I
should
never
have
carried
that
resentment
to
the
innocent
:
*NL*
but
I
assure
you
I
have
no
such
displeasure
.
Your
brother
appears
to
*NL*
me
to
be
a
man
of
sense
and
honour
.
I
do
not
disapprove
the
taste
of
*NL*
my
sister
;
nor
will
I
doubt
but
that
she
is
equally
the
object
of
his
*NL*
inclinations
.
I
have
always
thought
love
the
only
foundation
of
*NL*
happiness
in
a
married
state
,
as
it
can
only
produce
that
high
and
*NL*
tender
friendship
which
should
always
be
the
cement
of
this
union
;
*NL*
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
all
those
marriages
which
are
contracted
from
*NL*
other
motives
are
greatly
criminal
;
they
are
a
profanation
of
a
most
*NL*
holy
ceremony
,
and
generally
end
in
disquiet
and
misery
:
for
surely
we
*NL*
may
call
it
a
profanation
to
convert
this
most
sacred
institution
into
*NL*
a
wicked
sacrifice
to
lust
or
avarice
:
and
what
better
can
be
said
of
*NL*
those
matches
to
which
men
are
induced
merely
by
the
consideration
of
*NL*
a
beautiful
person
,
or
a
great
fortune
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
deny
that
beauty
is
an
agreeable
object
to
the
eye
,
and
even
*NL*
worthy
some
admiration
,
would
be
false
and
foolish
.
Beautiful
is
an
*NL*
epithet
often
used
in
Scripture
,
and
always
mentioned
with
honour
.
It
*NL*
was
my
own
fortune
to
marry
a
woman
whom
the
world
thought
handsome
,
*NL*
and
I
can
truly
say
I
liked
her
the
better
on
that
account
.
But
to
*NL*
make
this
the
sole
consideration
of
marriage
,
to
lust
after
it
so
*NL*
violently
as
to
overlook
all
imperfections
for
its
sake
,
or
to
require
*NL*
it
so
absolutely
as
to
reject
and
disdain
religion
,
virtue
,
and
sense
,
*NL*
which
are
qualities
in
their
nature
of
much
higher
perfection
,
only
*NL*
because
an
elegance
of
person
is
wanting
:
this
is
surely
inconsistent
,
*NL*
either
with
a
wise
man
or
a
good
Christian
.
And
it
is
,
perhaps
,
being
*NL*
too
charitable
to
conclude
that
such
persons
mean
anything
more
by
*NL*
their
marriage
than
to
please
their
carnal
appetites
;
for
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
which
,
we
are
taught
,
it
was
not
ordained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
next
place
,
with
respect
to
fortune
.
Worldly
prudence
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
exacts
some
consideration
on
this
head
;
nor
will
I
absolutely
*NL*
and
altogether
condemn
it
.
As
the
world
is
constituted
,
the
demands
of
*NL*
a
married
state
,
and
the
care
of
posterity
,
require
some
little
regard
*NL*
to
what
we
call
circumstances
.
Yet
this
provision
is
greatly
*NL*
increased
,
beyond
what
is
really
necessary
,
by
folly
and
vanity
,
which
*NL*
create
abundantly
more
wants
than
nature
.
Equipage
for
the
wife
,
and
*NL*
large
fortunes
for
the
children
,
are
by
custom
enrolled
in
the
list
of
*NL*
necessaries
;
and
to
procure
these
,
everything
truly
solid
and
sweet
,
*NL*
and
virtuous
and
religious
,
are
neglected
and
overlooked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
in
many
degrees
;
the
last
and
greatest
of
which
seems
scarce
*NL*
distinguishable
from
madness
;
--
I
mean
where
persons
of
immense
*NL*
fortunes
contract
themselves
to
those
who
are
,
and
must
be
,
*NL*
disagreeable
to
them
--
to
fools
and
knaves
--
in
order
to
increase
an
*NL*
estate
already
larger
even
than
the
demands
of
their
pleasures
.
Surely
*NL*
such
persons
,
if
they
will
not
be
thought
mad
,
must
own
,
either
that
*NL*
they
are
incapable
of
tasting
the
sweets
of
the
tenderest
friendship
,
*NL*
or
that
they
sacrifice
the
greatest
happiness
of
which
they
are
*NL*
capable
to
the
vain
,
uncertain
,
and
senseless
laws
of
vulgar
opinion
,
*NL*
which
owe
as
well
their
force
as
their
foundation
to
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Allworthy
concluded
his
sermon
,
to
which
Blifil
had
listened
with
*NL*
the
profoundest
attention
,
though
it
cost
him
some
pains
to
prevent
*NL*
now
and
then
a
small
discomposure
of
his
muscles
.
He
now
praised
every
*NL*
period
of
what
he
had
heard
with
the
warmth
of
a
young
divine
,
who
*NL*
hath
the
honour
to
dine
with
a
bishop
the
same
day
in
which
his
*NL*
lordship
hath
mounted
the
pulpit
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
xiii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
concludes
the
first
book
;
with
an
instance
of
ingratitude
,
*NL*
which
,
we
hope
,
will
appear
unnatural
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
,
from
what
hath
been
said
,
may
imagine
that
the
*NL*
reconciliation
-LRB-
if
indeed
it
could
be
so
called
-RRB-
was
only
matter
of
*NL*
form
;
we
shall
therefore
pass
it
over
,
and
hasten
to
what
must
surely
*NL*
be
thought
matter
of
substance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
had
acquainted
his
brother
with
what
had
past
between
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
and
him
;
and
added
with
a
smile
,
``
I
promise
you
I
paid
you
*NL*
off
;
nay
,
I
absolutely
desired
the
good
gentleman
not
to
forgive
you
:
*NL*
for
you
know
after
he
had
made
a
declaration
in
your
favour
,
I
might
*NL*
with
safety
venture
on
such
a
request
with
a
person
of
his
temper
;
and
*NL*
I
was
willing
,
as
well
for
your
sake
as
for
my
own
,
to
prevent
the
*NL*
least
possibility
of
a
suspicion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Blifil
took
not
the
least
notice
of
this
,
at
that
time
;
but
he
*NL*
afterwards
made
a
very
notable
use
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
maxims
which
the
devil
,
in
a
late
visit
upon
earth
,
left
to
*NL*
his
disciples
,
is
,
when
once
you
are
got
up
,
to
kick
the
stool
from
*NL*
under
you
.
In
plain
English
,
when
you
have
made
your
fortune
by
the
*NL*
good
offices
of
a
friend
,
you
are
advised
to
discard
him
as
soon
as
*NL*
you
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
the
captain
acted
by
this
maxim
,
I
will
not
positively
*NL*
determine
:
so
far
we
may
confidently
say
,
that
his
actions
may
be
*NL*
fairly
derived
from
this
diabolical
principle
;
and
indeed
it
is
*NL*
difficult
to
assign
any
other
motive
to
them
:
for
no
sooner
was
he
*NL*
possessed
of
Miss
Bridget
,
and
reconciled
to
Allworthy
,
than
he
began
*NL*
to
show
a
coldness
to
his
brother
which
increased
daily
;
till
at
*NL*
length
it
grew
into
rudeness
,
and
became
very
visible
to
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
remonstrated
to
him
privately
concerning
this
behaviour
,
*NL*
but
could
obtain
no
other
satisfaction
than
the
following
plain
*NL*
declaration
:
``
If
you
dislike
anything
in
my
brother
's
house
,
sir
,
you
*NL*
know
you
are
at
liberty
to
quit
it
.
''
This
strange
,
cruel
,
and
almost
*NL*
unaccountable
ingratitude
in
the
captain
,
absolutely
broke
the
poor
*NL*
doctor
's
heart
;
for
ingratitude
never
so
thoroughly
pierces
the
human
*NL*
breast
as
when
it
proceeds
from
those
in
whose
behalf
we
have
been
*NL*
guilty
of
transgressions
.
Reflections
on
great
and
good
actions
,
*NL*
however
they
are
received
or
returned
by
those
in
whose
favour
they
*NL*
are
performed
,
always
administer
some
comfort
to
us
;
but
what
*NL*
consolation
shall
we
receive
under
so
biting
a
calamity
as
the
*NL*
ungrateful
behaviour
of
our
friend
,
when
our
wounded
conscience
at
the
*NL*
same
time
flies
in
our
face
,
and
upbraids
us
with
having
spotted
it
in
*NL*
the
service
of
one
so
worthless
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
himself
spoke
to
the
captain
in
his
brother
's
behalf
,
and
*NL*
desired
to
know
what
offence
the
doctor
had
committed
;
when
the
*NL*
hard-hearted
villain
had
the
baseness
to
say
that
he
should
never
*NL*
forgive
him
for
the
injury
which
he
had
endeavoured
to
do
him
in
his
*NL*
favour
;
which
,
he
said
,
he
had
pumped
out
of
him
,
and
was
such
a
*NL*
cruelty
that
it
ought
not
to
be
forgiven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
spoke
in
very
high
terms
upon
this
declaration
,
which
,
he
*NL*
said
,
became
not
a
human
creature
.
He
expressed
,
indeed
,
so
much
*NL*
resentment
against
an
unforgiving
temper
,
that
the
captain
at
last
*NL*
pretended
to
be
convinced
by
his
arguments
,
and
outwardly
professed
to
*NL*
be
reconciled
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
bride
,
she
was
now
in
her
honeymoon
,
and
so
passionately
*NL*
fond
of
her
new
husband
that
he
never
appeared
to
her
to
be
in
the
*NL*
wrong
;
and
his
displeasure
against
any
person
was
a
sufficient
reason
*NL*
for
her
dislike
to
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
instance
,
was
outwardly
,
as
we
have
*NL*
said
,
reconciled
to
his
brother
;
yet
the
same
rancour
remained
in
his
*NL*
heart
;
and
he
found
so
many
opportunities
of
giving
him
private
hints
*NL*
of
this
,
that
the
house
at
last
grew
insupportable
to
the
poor
doctor
;
*NL*
and
he
chose
rather
to
submit
to
any
inconveniences
which
he
might
*NL*
encounter
in
the
world
,
than
longer
to
bear
these
cruel
and
ungrateful
*NL*
insults
from
a
brother
for
whom
he
had
done
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
once
intended
to
acquaint
Allworthy
with
the
whole
;
but
he
could
*NL*
not
bring
himself
to
submit
to
the
confession
,
by
which
he
must
take
*NL*
to
his
share
so
great
a
portion
of
guilt
.
Besides
,
by
how
much
the
*NL*
worse
man
he
represented
his
brother
to
be
,
so
much
the
greater
would
*NL*
his
own
offence
appear
to
Allworthy
,
and
so
much
the
greater
,
he
had
*NL*
reason
to
imagine
,
would
be
his
resentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
feigned
,
therefore
,
some
excuse
of
business
for
his
departure
,
and
*NL*
promised
to
return
soon
again
;
and
took
leave
of
his
brother
with
so
*NL*
well-dissembled
content
,
that
,
as
the
captain
played
his
part
to
the
*NL*
same
perfection
,
Allworthy
remained
well
satisfied
with
the
truth
of
*NL*
the
reconciliation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
went
directly
to
London
,
where
he
died
soon
after
of
a
*NL*
broken
heart
;
a
distemper
which
kills
many
more
than
is
generally
*NL*
imagined
,
and
would
have
a
fair
title
to
a
place
in
the
bill
of
*NL*
mortality
,
did
it
not
differ
in
one
instance
from
all
other
*NL*
diseases
--
viz.
,
that
no
physician
can
cure
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
upon
the
most
diligent
enquiry
into
the
former
lives
of
these
two
*NL*
brothers
,
I
find
,
besides
the
cursed
and
hellish
maxim
of
policy
above
*NL*
mentioned
,
another
reason
for
the
captain
's
conduct
:
the
captain
,
*NL*
besides
what
we
have
before
said
of
him
,
was
a
man
of
great
pride
and
*NL*
fierceness
,
and
had
always
treated
his
brother
,
who
was
of
a
different
*NL*
complexion
,
and
greatly
deficient
in
both
these
qualities
,
with
the
*NL*
utmost
air
of
superiority
.
The
doctor
,
however
,
had
much
the
larger
*NL*
share
of
learning
,
and
was
by
many
reputed
to
have
the
better
*NL*
understanding
.
This
the
captain
knew
,
and
could
not
bear
;
for
though
*NL*
envy
is
at
best
a
very
malignant
passion
,
yet
is
its
bitterness
*NL*
greatly
heightened
by
mixing
with
contempt
towards
the
same
object
;
*NL*
and
very
much
afraid
I
am
,
that
whenever
an
obligation
is
joined
to
*NL*
these
two
,
indignation
and
not
gratitude
will
be
the
product
of
all
*NL*
three

Showing
what
kind
of
a
history
this
is
;
what
it
is
like
,
and
what
it
*NL*
is
not
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
we
have
properly
enough
entitled
this
our
work
,
a
history
,
and
*NL*
not
a
life
;
nor
an
apology
for
a
life
,
as
is
more
in
fashion
;
yet
we
*NL*
intend
in
it
rather
to
pursue
the
method
of
those
writers
,
who
profess
*NL*
to
disclose
the
revolutions
of
countries
,
than
to
imitate
the
painful
*NL*
and
voluminous
historian
,
who
,
to
preserve
the
regularity
of
his
*NL*
series
,
thinks
himself
obliged
to
fill
up
as
much
paper
with
the
*NL*
detail
of
months
and
years
in
which
nothing
remarkable
happened
,
as
he
*NL*
employs
upon
those
notable
aeras
when
the
greatest
scenes
have
been
*NL*
transacted
on
the
human
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
histories
as
these
do
,
in
reality
,
very
much
resemble
a
*NL*
newspaper
,
which
consists
of
just
the
same
number
of
words
,
whether
*NL*
there
be
any
news
in
it
or
not
.
They
may
likewise
be
compared
to
a
*NL*
stage
coach
,
which
performs
constantly
the
same
course
,
empty
as
well
*NL*
as
full
.
The
writer
,
indeed
,
seems
to
think
himself
obliged
to
keep
*NL*
even
pace
with
time
,
whose
amanuensis
he
is
;
and
,
like
his
master
,
*NL*
travels
as
slowly
through
centuries
of
monkish
dulness
,
when
the
world
*NL*
seems
to
have
been
asleep
,
as
through
that
bright
and
busy
age
so
*NL*
nobly
distinguished
by
the
excellent
Latin
poet
--

Of
which
we
wish
we
could
give
our
readers
a
more
adequate
translation
*NL*
than
that
by
Mr
Creech
--
*NL*
*NL*
When
dreadful
Carthage
frighted
Rome
with
arms
,
*NL*
And
all
the
world
was
shook
with
fierce
alarms
;
*NL*
Whilst
undecided
yet
,
which
part
should
fall
,
*NL*
Which
nation
rise
the
glorious
lord
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
is
our
purpose
,
in
the
ensuing
pages
,
to
pursue
a
contrary
*NL*
method
.
When
any
extraordinary
scene
presents
itself
-LRB-
as
we
trust
will
*NL*
often
be
the
case
-RRB-
,
we
shall
spare
no
pains
nor
paper
to
open
it
at
*NL*
large
to
our
reader
;
but
if
whole
years
should
pass
without
producing
*NL*
anything
worthy
his
notice
,
we
shall
not
be
afraid
of
a
chasm
in
our
*NL*
history
;
but
shall
hasten
on
to
matters
of
consequence
,
and
leave
such
*NL*
periods
of
time
totally
unobserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
are
indeed
to
be
considered
as
blanks
in
the
grand
lottery
of
*NL*
time
.
We
therefore
,
who
are
the
registers
of
that
lottery
,
shall
*NL*
imitate
those
sagacious
persons
who
deal
in
that
which
is
drawn
at
*NL*
Guildhall
,
and
who
never
trouble
the
public
with
the
many
blanks
they
*NL*
dispose
of
;
but
when
a
great
prize
happens
to
be
drawn
,
the
newspapers
*NL*
are
presently
filled
with
it
,
and
the
world
is
sure
to
be
informed
at
*NL*
whose
office
it
was
sold
:
indeed
,
commonly
two
or
three
different
*NL*
offices
lay
claim
to
the
honour
of
having
disposed
of
it
;
by
which
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
the
adventurers
are
given
to
understand
that
certain
brokers
*NL*
are
in
the
secrets
of
Fortune
,
and
indeed
of
her
cabinet
council
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
reader
then
is
not
to
be
surprized
,
if
,
in
the
course
of
this
work
,
*NL*
he
shall
find
some
chapters
very
short
,
and
others
altogether
as
long
;
*NL*
some
that
contain
only
the
time
of
a
single
day
,
and
others
that
*NL*
comprise
years
;
in
a
word
,
if
my
history
sometimes
seems
to
stand
*NL*
still
,
and
sometimes
to
fly
.
For
all
which
I
shall
not
look
on
myself
*NL*
as
accountable
to
any
court
of
critical
jurisdiction
whatever
:
for
as
*NL*
I
am
,
in
reality
,
the
founder
of
a
new
province
of
writing
,
so
I
am
at
*NL*
liberty
to
make
what
laws
I
please
therein
.
And
these
laws
,
my
*NL*
readers
,
whom
I
consider
as
my
subjects
,
are
bound
to
believe
in
and
*NL*
to
obey
;
with
which
that
they
may
readily
and
cheerfully
comply
,
I
do
*NL*
hereby
assure
them
that
I
shall
principally
regard
their
ease
and
*NL*
advantage
in
all
such
institutions
:
for
I
do
not
,
like
a
_
jure
divino
_
*NL*
tyrant
,
imagine
that
they
are
my
slaves
,
or
my
commodity
.
I
am
,
*NL*
indeed
,
set
over
them
for
their
own
good
only
,
and
was
created
for
*NL*
their
use
,
and
not
they
for
mine
.
Nor
do
I
doubt
,
while
I
make
their
*NL*
interest
the
great
rule
of
my
writings
,
they
will
unanimously
concur

in
supporting

Religious
cautions
against
showing
too
much
favour
to
bastards
;
and
a
*NL*
great
discovery
made
by
Mrs
Deborah
Wilkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Eight
months
after
the
celebration
of
the
nuptials
between
Captain
*NL*
Blifil
and
Miss
Bridget
Allworthy
,
a
young
lady
of
great
beauty
,
*NL*
merit
,
and
fortune
,
was
Miss
Bridget
,
by
reason
of
a
fright
,
delivered
*NL*
of
a
fine
boy
.
The
child
was
indeed
to
all
appearances
perfect
;
but
*NL*
the
midwife
discovered
it
was
born
a
month
before
its
full
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
birth
of
an
heir
by
his
beloved
sister
was
a
circumstance
*NL*
of
great
joy
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
yet
it
did
not
alienate
his
affections
*NL*
from
the
little
foundling
,
to
whom
he
had
been
godfather
,
had
given
*NL*
his
own
name
of
Thomas
,
and
whom
he
had
hitherto
seldom
failed
of
*NL*
visiting
,
at
least
once
a
day
,
in
his
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
his
sister
,
if
she
pleased
,
the
new-born
infant
should
be
bred
*NL*
up
together
with
little
Tommy
;
to
which
she
consented
,
though
with
*NL*
some
little
reluctance
:
for
she
had
truly
a
great
complacence
for
her
*NL*
brother
;
and
hence
she
had
always
behaved
towards
the
foundling
with
*NL*
rather
more
kindness
than
ladies
of
rigid
virtue
can
sometimes
bring
*NL*
themselves
to
show
to
these
children
,
who
,
however
innocent
,
may
be
*NL*
truly
called
the
living
monuments
of
incontinence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
could
not
so
easily
bring
himself
to
bear
what
he
*NL*
condemned
as
a
fault
in
Mr
Allworthy
.
He
gave
him
frequent
hints
,
that
*NL*
to
adopt
the
fruits
of
sin
,
was
to
give
countenance
to
it
.
He
quoted
*NL*
several
texts
-LRB-
for
he
was
well
read
in
Scripture
-RRB-
,
such
as
,
_
He
visits
*NL*
the
sins
of
the
fathers
upon
the
children
;
and
the
fathers
have
eaten
*NL*
sour
grapes
,
and
the
children
's
teeth
are
set
on
edge
_
,
&
c.
Whence
he
*NL*
argued
the
legality
of
punishing
the
crime
of
the
parent
on
the
*NL*
bastard
.
He
said
,
``
Though
the
law
did
not
positively
allow
the
*NL*
destroying
such
base-born
children
,
yet
it
held
them
to
be
the
*NL*
children
of
nobody
;
that
the
Church
considered
them
as
the
children
of
*NL*
nobody
;
and
that
at
the
best
,
they
ought
to
be
brought
up
to
the
*NL*
lowest
and
vilest
offices
of
the
commonwealth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
answered
to
all
this
,
and
much
more
,
which
the
captain
*NL*
had
urged
on
this
subject
,
``
That
,
however
guilty
the
parents
might
be
,
*NL*
the
children
were
certainly
innocent
:
that
as
to
the
texts
he
had
*NL*
quoted
,
the
former
of
them
was
a
particular
denunciation
against
the
*NL*
Jews
,
for
the
sin
of
idolatry
,
of
relinquishing
and
hating
their
*NL*
heavenly
King
;
and
the
latter
was
parabolically
spoken
,
and
rather
*NL*
intended
to
denote
the
certain
and
necessary
consequences
of
sin
,
than
*NL*
any
express
judgment
against
it
.
But
to
represent
the
Almighty
as
*NL*
avenging
the
sins
of
the
guilty
on
the
innocent
,
was
indecent
,
if
not
*NL*
blasphemous
,
as
it
was
to
represent
him
acting
against
the
first
*NL*
principles
of
natural
justice
,
and
against
the
original
notions
of
*NL*
right
and
wrong
,
which
he
himself
had
implanted
in
our
minds
;
by
which
*NL*
we
were
to
judge
not
only
in
all
matters
which
were
not
revealed
,
but
*NL*
even
of
the
truth
of
revelation
itself
.
He
said
he
knew
many
held
the
*NL*
same
principles
with
the
captain
on
this
head
;
but
he
was
himself
*NL*
firmly
convinced
to
the
contrary
,
and
would
provide
in
the
same
manner
*NL*
for
this
poor
infant
,
as
if
a
legitimate
child
had
had
fortune
to
have
*NL*
been
found
in
the
same
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
captain
was
taking
all
opportunities
to
press
these
and
such
*NL*
like
arguments
,
to
remove
the
little
foundling
from
Mr
Allworthy
's
,
of
*NL*
whose
fondness
for
him
he
began
to
be
jealous
,
Mrs
Deborah
had
made
a
*NL*
discovery
,
which
,
in
its
event
,
threatened
at
least
to
prove
more
*NL*
fatal
to
poor
Tommy
than
all
the
reasonings
of
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
the
insatiable
curiosity
of
this
good
woman
had
carried
her
on
*NL*
to
that
business
,
or
whether
she
did
it
to
confirm
herself
in
the
good
*NL*
graces
of
Mrs
Blifil
,
who
,
notwithstanding
her
outward
behaviour
to
*NL*
the
foundling
,
frequently
abused
the
infant
in
private
,
and
her
*NL*
brother
too
,
for
his
fondness
to
it
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
she
had
*NL*
now
,
as
she
conceived
,
fully
detected
the
father
of
the
foundling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
this
was
a
discovery
of
great
consequence
,
it
may
be
necessary
*NL*
to
trace
it
from
the
fountain-head
.
We
shall
therefore
very
minutely
*NL*
lay
open
those
previous
matters
by
which
it
was
produced
;
and
for
that
*NL*
purpose
we
shall
be
obliged
to
reveal
all
the
secrets
of
a
little
*NL*
family
with
which
my
reader
is
at
present
entirely
unacquainted
;
and
*NL*
of
which
the
oeconomy
was
so
rare
and
extraordinary
,
that
I
fear
it
*NL*
will
shock
the
utmost
credulity
of
many

*NL*
My
reader
may
please
to
remember
he
hath
been
informed
that
Jenny
*NL*
Jones
had
lived
some
years
with
a
certain
schoolmaster
,
who
had
,
at
*NL*
her
earnest
desire
,
instructed
her
in
Latin
,
in
which
,
to
do
justice
*NL*
to
her
genius
,
she
had
so
improved
herself
,
that
she
was
become
a
*NL*
better
scholar
than
her
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
though
this
poor
man
had
undertaken
a
profession
to
which
*NL*
learning
must
be
allowed
necessary
,
this
was
the
least
of
his
*NL*
commendations
.
He
was
one
of
the
best-natured
fellows
in
the
world
,
*NL*
and
was
,
at
the
same
time
,
master
of
so
much
pleasantry
and
humour
,
*NL*
that
he
was
reputed
the
wit
of
the
country
;
and
all
the
neighbouring
*NL*
gentlemen
were
so
desirous
of
his
company
,
that
as
denying
was
not
his
*NL*
talent
,
he
spent
much
time
at
their
houses
,
which
he
might
,
with
more
*NL*
emolument
,
have
spent
in
his
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
imagined
that
a
gentleman
so
qualified
and
so
disposed
,
was
*NL*
in
no
danger
of
becoming
formidable
to
the
learned
seminaries
of
Eton
*NL*
or
Westminster
.
To
speak
plainly
,
his
scholars
were
divided
into
two
*NL*
classes
:
in
the
upper
of
which
was
a
young
gentleman
,
the
son
of
a
*NL*
neighbouring
squire
,
who
,
at
the
age
of
seventeen
,
was
just
entered
*NL*
into
his
Syntaxis
;
and
in
the
lower
was
a
second
son
of
the
same
*NL*
gentleman
,
who
,
together
with
seven
parish-boys
,
was
learning
to
read
*NL*
and
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stipend
arising
hence
would
hardly
have
indulged
the
schoolmaster
*NL*
in
the
luxuries
of
life
,
had
he
not
added
to
this
office
those
of
*NL*
clerk
and
barber
,
and
had
not
Mr
Allworthy
added
to
the
whole
an
*NL*
annuity
of
ten
pounds
,
which
the
poor
man
received
every
Christmas
,
*NL*
and
with
which
he
was
enabled
to
cheer
his
heart
during
that
sacred
*NL*
festival
.

Among
his
other
treasures
,
the
pedagogue
had
a
wife
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
married
out
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
kitchen
for
her
fortune
,
viz.
,
twenty
*NL*
pounds
,
which
she
had
there
amassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
woman
was
not
very
amiable
in
her
person
.
Whether
she
sat
to
my
*NL*
friend
Hogarth
,
or
no
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
she
exactly
resembled
*NL*
the
young
woman
who
is
pouring
out
her
mistress
's
tea
in
the
third
*NL*
picture
of
the
Harlot
's
Progress
.
She
was
,
besides
,
a
profest
follower
*NL*
of
that
noble
sect
founded
by
Xantippe
of
old
;
by
means
of
which
she
*NL*
became
more
formidable
in
the
school
than
her
husband
;
for
,
to
confess
*NL*
the
truth
,
he
was
never
master
there
,
or
anywhere
else
,
in
her
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
her
countenance
did
not
denote
much
natural
sweetness
of
*NL*
temper
,
yet
this
was
,
perhaps
,
somewhat
soured
by
a
circumstance
which
*NL*
generally
poisons
matrimonial
felicity
;
for
children
are
rightly
*NL*
called
the
pledges
of
love
;
and
her
husband
,
though
they
had
been
*NL*
married
nine
years
,
had
given
her
no
such
pledges
;
a
default
for
which
*NL*
he
had
no
excuse
,
either
from
age
or
health
,
being
not
yet
thirty
*NL*
years
old
,
and
what
they
call
a
jolly
brisk
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
arose
another
evil
,
which
produced
no
little
uneasiness
to
the
*NL*
poor
pedagogue
,
of
whom
she
maintained
so
constant
a
jealousy
,
that
he
*NL*
durst
hardly
speak
to
one
woman
in
the
parish
;
for
the
least
degree
of
*NL*
civility
,
or
even
correspondence
,
with
any
female
,
was
sure
to
bring
*NL*
his
wife
upon
her
back
,
and
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
guard
herself
against
matrimonial
injuries
in
her
own
*NL*
house
,
as
she
kept
one
maid-servant
,
she
always
took
care
to
chuse
her
*NL*
out
of
that
order
of
females
whose
faces
are
taken
as
a
kind
of
*NL*
security
for
their
virtue
;
of
which
number
Jenny
Jones
,
as
the
reader
*NL*
hath
been
before
informed
,
was
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
face
of
this
young
woman
might
be
called
pretty
good
security
*NL*
of
the
before-mentioned
kind
,
and
as
her
behaviour
had
been
always
*NL*
extremely
modest
,
which
is
the
certain
consequence
of
understanding
in
*NL*
women
;
she
had
passed
above
four
years
at
Mr
Partridge
's
-LRB-
for
that
was
*NL*
the
schoolmaster
's
name
-RRB-
without
creating
the
least
suspicion
in
her
*NL*
mistress
.
Nay
,
she
had
been
treated
with
uncommon
kindness
,
and
her
*NL*
mistress
had
permitted
Mr
Partridge
to
give
her
those
instructions
*NL*
which
have
been
before
commemorated
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
with
jealousy
as
with
the
gout
:
when
such
distempers
are
in
*NL*
the
blood
,
there
is
never
any
security
against
their
breaking
out
;
and
*NL*
that
often
on
the
slightest
occasions
,
and
when
least
suspected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
happened
to
Mrs
Partridge
,
who
had
submitted
four
years
to
her
*NL*
husband
's
teaching
this
young
woman
,
and
had
suffered
her
often
to
*NL*
neglect
her
work
,
in
order
to
pursue
her
learning
.
For
,
passing
by
one
*NL*
day
,
as
the
girl
was
reading
,
and
her
master
leaning
over
her
,
the
*NL*
girl
,
I
know
not
for
what
reason
,
suddenly
started
up
from
her
chair
:
*NL*
and
this
was
the
first
time
that
suspicion
ever
entered
into
the
head
*NL*
of
her
mistress
.
This
did
not
,
however
,
at
that
time
discover
itself
,
*NL*
but
lay
lurking
in
her
mind
,
like
a
concealed
enemy
,
who
waits
for
a
*NL*
reinforcement
of
additional
strength
before
he
openly
declares
himself
*NL*
and
proceeds
upon
hostile
operations
:
and
such
additional
strength
*NL*
soon
arrived
to
corroborate
her
suspicion
;
for
not
long
after
,
the
*NL*
husband
and
wife
being
at
dinner
,
the
master
said
to
his
maid
,
_
Da
*NL*
mihi
aliquid
potum
:
_
upon
which
the
poor
girl
smiled
,
perhaps
at
the
*NL*
badness
of
the
Latin
,
and
,
when
her
mistress
cast
her
eyes
on
her
,
*NL*
blushed
,
possibly
with
a
consciousness
of
having
laughed
at
her
*NL*
master
.
Mrs
Partridge
,
upon
this
,
immediately
fell
into
a
fury
,
and
*NL*
discharged
the
trencher
on
which
she
was
eating
,
at
the
head
of
poor
*NL*
Jenny
,
crying
out
,
``
You
impudent
whore
,
do
you
play
tricks
with
my
*NL*
husband
before
my
face
?
''
and
at
the
same
instant
rose
from
her
chair
*NL*
with
a
knife
in
her
hand
,
with
which
,
most
probably
,
she
would
have
*NL*
executed
very
tragical
vengeance
,
had
not
the
girl
taken
the
advantage
*NL*
of
being
nearer
the
door
than
her
mistress
,
and
avoided
her
fury
by
*NL*
running
away
:
for
,
as
to
the
poor
husband
,
whether
surprize
had
*NL*
rendered
him
motionless
,
or
fear
-LRB-
which
is
full
as
probable
-RRB-
had
*NL*
restrained
him
from
venturing
at
any
opposition
,
he
sat
staring
and
*NL*
trembling
in
his
chair
;
nor
did
he
once
offer
to
move
or
speak
,
till
*NL*
his
wife
,
returning
from
the
pursuit
of
Jenny
,
made
some
defensive
*NL*
measures
necessary
for
his
own
preservation
;
and
he
likewise
was
*NL*
obliged
to
retreat
,
after
the
example
of
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
good
woman
was
,
no
more
than
Othello
,
of
a
disposition
*NL*
*NL*
To
make
a
life
of
jealousy
*NL*
And
follow
still
the
changes
of
the
moon
*NL*
With
fresh
suspicions
--
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
,
as
well
as
him
,
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
be
once
in
doubt
,
*NL*
Was
once
to
be
resolvd
--
*NL*
*NL*
she
therefore
ordered
Jenny
immediately
to
pack
up
her
alls
and
*NL*
begone
,
for
that
she
was
determined
she
should
not
sleep
that
night
*NL*
within
her
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Partridge
had
profited
too
much
by
experience
to
interpose
in
a
*NL*
matter
of
this
nature
.
He
therefore
had
recourse
to
his
usual
receipt
*NL*
of
patience
,
for
,
though
he
was
not
a
great
adept
in
Latin
,
he
*NL*
remembered
,
and
well
understood
,
the
advice
contained
in
these
words
*NL*
*NL*
--
_
Leve
fit
quod
bene
fertur
onus
_
*NL*
*NL*
in
English
:
*NL*
*NL*
A
burden
becomes
lightest
when
it
is
well
borne
--
*NL*
*NL*
which
he
had
always
in
his
mouth
;
and
of
which
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
*NL*
had
often
occasion
to
experience
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jenny
offered
to
make
protestations
of
her
innocence
;
but
the
tempest
*NL*
was
too
strong
for
her
to
be
heard
.
She
then
betook
herself
to
the
*NL*
business
of
packing
,
for
which
a
small
quantity
of
brown
paper
*NL*
sufficed
,
and
,
having
received
her
small
pittance
of
wages
,
she
*NL*
returned
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
schoolmaster
and
his
consort
passed
their
time
unpleasantly
enough
*NL*
that
evening
,
but
something
or
other
happened
before
the
next
morning
,
*NL*
which
a
little
abated
the
fury
of
Mrs
Partridge
;
and
she
at
length
*NL*
admitted
her
husband
to
make
his
excuses
:
to
which
she
gave
the
*NL*
readier
belief
,
as
he
had
,
instead
of
desiring
her
to
recall
Jenny
,
*NL*
professed
a
satisfaction
in
her
being
dismissed
,
saying
,
she
was
grown
*NL*
of
little
use
as
a
servant
,
spending
all
her
time
in
reading
,
and
was
*NL*
become
,
moreover
,
very
pert
and
obstinate
;
for
,
indeed
,
she
and
her
*NL*
master
had
lately
had
frequent
disputes
in
literature
;
in
which
,
as
*NL*
hath
been
said
,
she
was
become
greatly
his
superior
.
This
,
however
,
he
*NL*
would
by
no
means
allow
;
and
as
he
called
her
persisting
in
the
right
,
*NL*
obstinacy
,
he
began
to
hate
her
with
no
small
inveteracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
one
of
the
most
bloody
battles
,
or
rather
duels
,
that
were
*NL*
ever
recorded
in
domestic
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
reasons
mentioned
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
and
from
some
*NL*
other
matrimonial
concessions
,
well
known
to
most
husbands
,
and
which
,
*NL*
like
the
secrets
of
freemasonry
,
should
be
divulged
to
none
who
are
*NL*
not
members
of
that
honourable
fraternity
,
Mrs
Partridge
was
pretty
*NL*
well
satisfied
that
she
had
condemned
her
husband
without
cause
,
and
*NL*
endeavoured
by
acts
of
kindness
to
make
him
amends
for
her
false
*NL*
suspicion
.
Her
passions
were
indeed
equally
violent
,
whichever
way
*NL*
they
inclined
;
for
as
she
could
be
extremely
angry
,
so
could
she
be
*NL*
altogether
as
fond
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
these
passions
ordinarily
succeed
each
other
,
and
scarce
*NL*
twenty-four
hours
ever
passed
in
which
the
pedagogue
was
not
,
in
some
*NL*
degree
,
the
object
of
both
;
yet
,
on
extraordinary
occasions
,
when
the
*NL*
passion
of
anger
had
raged
very
high
,
the
remission
was
usually
*NL*
longer
:
and
so
was
the
case
at
present
;
for
she
continued
longer
in
a
*NL*
state
of
affability
,
after
this
fit
of
jealousy
was
ended
,
than
her
*NL*
husband
had
ever
known
before
:
and
,
had
it
not
been
for
some
little
*NL*
exercises
,
which
all
the
followers
of
Xantippe
are
obliged
to
perform
*NL*
daily
,
Mr
Partridge
would
have
enjoyed
a
perfect
serenity
of
several
*NL*
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perfect
calms
at
sea
are
always
suspected
by
the
experienced
mariner
*NL*
to
be
the
forerunners
of
a
storm
,
and
I
know
some
persons
,
who
,
*NL*
without
being
generally
the
devotees
of
superstition
,
are
apt
to
*NL*
apprehend
that
great
and
unusual
peace
or
tranquillity
will
be
*NL*
attended
with
its
opposite
.
For
which
reason
the
antients
used
,
on
*NL*
such
occasions
,
to
sacrifice
to
the
goddess
Nemesis
,
a
deity
who
was
*NL*
thought
by
them
to
look
with
an
invidious
eye
on
human
felicity
,
and
*NL*
to
have
a
peculiar
delight
in
overturning
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
are
very
far
from
believing
in
any
such
heathen
goddess
,
or
from
*NL*
encouraging
any
superstition
,
so
we
wish
Mr
John
Fr
--
,
or
some
other
*NL*
such
philosopher
,
would
bestir
himself
a
little
,
in
order
to
find
out
*NL*
the
real
cause
of
this
sudden
transition
from
good
to
bad
fortune
,
*NL*
which
hath
been
so
often
remarked
,
and
of
which
we
shall
proceed
to
*NL*
give
an
instance
;
for
it
is
our
province
to
relate
facts
,
and
we
shall
*NL*
leave
causes
to
persons
of
much
higher
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mankind
have
always
taken
great
delight
in
knowing
and
descanting
on
*NL*
the
actions
of
others
.
Hence
there
have
been
,
in
all
ages
and
nations
,
*NL*
certain
places
set
apart
for
public
rendezvous
,
where
the
curious
*NL*
might
meet
and
satisfy
their
mutual
curiosity
.
Among
these
,
the
*NL*
barbers
'
shops
have
justly
borne
the
pre-eminence
.
Among
the
Greeks
,
*NL*
barbers
'
news
was
a
proverbial
expression
;
and
Horace
,
in
one
of
his
*NL*
epistles
,
makes
honourable
mention
of
the
Roman
barbers
in
the
same
*NL*
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
of
England
are
known
to
be
no
wise
inferior
to
their
Greek
or
*NL*
Roman
predecessors
.
You
there
see
foreign
affairs
discussed
in
a
*NL*
manner
little
inferior
to
that
with
which
they
are
handled
in
the
*NL*
coffee-houses
;
and
domestic
occurrences
are
much
more
largely
and
*NL*
freely
treated
in
the
former
than
in
the
latter
.
But
this
serves
only
*NL*
for
the
men
.
Now
,
whereas
the
females
of
this
country
,
especially
*NL*
those
of
the
lower
order
,
do
associate
themselves
much
more
than
those
*NL*
of
other
nations
,
our
polity
would
be
highly
deficient
,
if
they
had
*NL*
not
some
place
set
apart
likewise
for
the
indulgence
of
their
*NL*
curiosity
,
seeing
they
are
in
this
no
way
inferior
to
the
other
half
*NL*
of
the
species
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
enjoying
,
therefore
,
such
place
of
rendezvous
,
the
British
fair
*NL*
ought
to
esteem
themselves
more
happy
than
any
of
their
foreign
*NL*
sisters
;
as
I
do
not
remember
either
to
have
read
in
history
,
or
to
*NL*
have
seen
in
my
travels
,
anything
of
the
like
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
place
then
is
no
other
than
the
chandler
's
shop
,
the
known
seat
*NL*
of
all
the
news
;
or
,
as
it
is
vulgarly
called
,
gossiping
,
in
every
*NL*
parish
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Partridge
being
one
day
at
this
assembly
of
females
,
was
asked
by
*NL*
one
of
her
neighbours
,
if
she
had
heard
no
news
lately
of
Jenny
Jones
?
*NL*
To
which
she
answered
in
the
negative
.
Upon
this
the
other
replied
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
That
the
parish
was
very
much
obliged
to
her
for
having
*NL*
turned
Jenny
away
as
she
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Partridge
,
whose
jealousy
,
as
the
reader
well
knows
,
was
long
*NL*
since
cured
,
and
who
had
no
other
quarrel
to
her
maid
,
answered
*NL*
boldly
,
She
did
not
know
any
obligation
the
parish
had
to
her
on
that
*NL*
account
;
for
she
believed
Jenny
had
scarce
left
her
equal
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
truly
,
''
said
the
gossip
,
``
I
hope
not
,
though
I
fancy
we
have
*NL*
sluts
enow
too
.
Then
you
have
not
heard
,
it
seems
,
that
she
hath
been
*NL*
brought
to
bed
of
two
bastards
?
but
as
they
are
not
born
here
,
my
*NL*
husband
and
the
other
overseer
says
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
keep
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
bastards
!
''
answered
Mrs
Partridge
hastily
:
``
you
surprize
me
!
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
whether
we
must
keep
them
;
but
I
am
sure
they
must
have
*NL*
been
begotten
here
,
for
the
wench
hath
not
been
nine
months
gone
*NL*
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
can
be
so
quick
and
sudden
as
the
operations
of
the
mind
,
*NL*
especially
when
hope
,
or
fear
,
or
jealousy
,
to
which
the
two
others
*NL*
are
but
journeymen
,
set
it
to
work
.
It
occurred
instantly
to
her
,
that
*NL*
Jenny
had
scarce
ever
been
out
of
her
own
house
while
she
lived
with
*NL*
her
.
The
leaning
over
the
chair
,
the
sudden
starting
up
,
the
Latin
,
*NL*
the
smile
,
and
many
other
things
,
rushed
upon
her
all
at
once
.
The
*NL*
satisfaction
her
husband
expressed
in
the
departure
of
Jenny
,
appeared
*NL*
now
to
be
only
dissembled
;
again
,
in
the
same
instant
,
to
be
real
;
but
*NL*
yet
to
confirm
her
jealousy
,
proceeding
from
satiety
,
and
a
hundred
*NL*
other
bad
causes
.
In
a
word
,
she
was
convinced
of
her
husband
's
guilt
,
*NL*
and
immediately
left
the
assembly
in
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
fair
Grimalkin
,
who
,
though
the
youngest
of
the
feline
family
,
*NL*
degenerates
not
in
ferocity
from
the
elder
branches
of
her
house
,
and
*NL*
though
inferior
in
strength
,
is
equal
in
fierceness
to
the
noble
tiger
*NL*
himself
,
when
a
little
mouse
,
whom
it
hath
long
tormented
in
sport
,
*NL*
escapes
from
her
clutches
for
a
while
,
frets
,
scolds
,
growls
,
swears
;
*NL*
but
if
the
trunk
,
or
box
,
behind
which
the
mouse
lay
hid
be
again
*NL*
removed
,
she
flies
like
lightning
on
her
prey
,
and
,
with
envenomed
*NL*
wrath
,
bites
,
scratches
,
mumbles
,
and
tears
the
little
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
with
less
fury
did
Mrs
Partridge
fly
on
the
poor
pedagogue
.
Her
*NL*
tongue
,
teeth
,
and
hands
,
fell
all
upon
him
at
once
.
His
wig
was
in
an
*NL*
instant
torn
from
his
head
,
his
shirt
from
his
back
,
and
from
his
face
*NL*
descended
five
streams
of
blood
,
denoting
the
number
of
claws
with
*NL*
which
nature
had
unhappily
armed
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Partridge
acted
for
some
time
on
the
defensive
only
;
indeed
he
*NL*
attempted
only
to
guard
his
face
with
his
hands
;
but
as
he
found
that
*NL*
his
antagonist
abated
nothing
of
her
rage
,
he
thought
he
might
,
at
*NL*
least
,
endeavour
to
disarm
her
,
or
rather
to
confine
her
arms
;
in
*NL*
doing
which
her
cap
fell
off
in
the
struggle
,
and
her
hair
being
too
*NL*
short
to
reach
her
shoulders
,
erected
itself
on
her
head
;
her
stays
*NL*
likewise
,
which
were
laced
through
one
single
hole
at
the
bottom
,
*NL*
burst
open
;
and
her
breasts
,
which
were
much
more
redundant
than
her
*NL*
hair
,
hung
down
below
her
middle
;
her
face
was
likewise
marked
with
*NL*
the
blood
of
her
husband
:
her
teeth
gnashed
with
rage
;
and
fire
,
such
*NL*
as
sparkles
from
a
smith
's
forge
,
darted
from
her
eyes
.
So
that
,
*NL*
altogether
,
this
Amazonian
heroine
might
have
been
an
object
of
terror
*NL*
to
a
much
bolder
man
than
Mr
Partridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
at
length
,
the
good
fortune
,
by
getting
possession
of
her
*NL*
arms
,
to
render
those
weapons
which
she
wore
at
the
ends
of
her
*NL*
fingers
useless
;
which
she
no
sooner
perceived
,
than
the
softness
of
*NL*
her
sex
prevailed
over
her
rage
,
and
she
presently
dissolved
in
tears
,
*NL*
which
soon
after
concluded
in
a
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
small
share
of
sense
which
Mr
Partridge
had
hitherto
preserved
*NL*
through
this
scene
of
fury
,
of
the
cause
of
which
he
was
hitherto
*NL*
ignorant
,
now
utterly
abandoned
him
.
He
ran
instantly
into
the
street
,
*NL*
hallowing
out
that
his
wife
was
in
the
agonies
of
death
,
and
*NL*
beseeching
the
neighbours
to
fly
with
the
utmost
haste
to
her
*NL*
assistance
.
Several
good
women
obeyed
his
summons
,
who
entering
his
*NL*
house
,
and
applying
the
usual
remedies
on
such
occasions
,
Mrs
*NL*
Partridge
was
at
length
,
to
the
great
joy
of
her
husband
,
brought
to
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
had
a
little
recollected
her
spirits
,
and
somewhat
*NL*
composed
herself
with
a
cordial
,
she
began
to
inform
the
company
of
*NL*
the
manifold
injuries
she
had
received
from
her
husband
;
who
,
she
*NL*
said
,
was
not
contented
to
injure
her
in
her
bed
;
but
,
upon
her
*NL*
upbraiding
him
with
it
,
had
treated
her
in
the
cruelest
manner
*NL*
imaginable
;
had
tore
her
cap
and
hair
from
her
head
,
and
her
stays
*NL*
from
her
body
,
giving
her
,
at
the
same
time
,
several
blows
,
the
marks
*NL*
of
which
she
should
carry
to
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
man
,
who
bore
on
his
face
many
more
visible
marks
of
the
*NL*
indignation
of
his
wife
,
stood
in
silent
astonishment
at
this
*NL*
accusation
;
which
the
reader
will
,
I
believe
,
bear
witness
for
him
,
*NL*
had
greatly
exceeded
the
truth
;
for
indeed
he
had
not
struck
her
once
;
*NL*
and
this
silence
being
interpreted
to
be
a
confession
of
the
charge
by
*NL*
the
whole
court
,
they
all
began
at
once
,
_
una
voce
_
,
to
rebuke
and
*NL*
revile
him
,
repeating
often
,
that
none
but
a
coward
ever
struck
a
*NL*
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Partridge
bore
all
this
patiently
;
but
when
his
wife
appealed
to
*NL*
the
blood
on
her
face
,
as
an
evidence
of
his
barbarity
,
he
could
not
*NL*
help
laying
claim
to
his
own
blood
,
for
so
it
really
was
;
as
he
*NL*
thought
it
very
unnatural
,
that
this
should
rise
up
-LRB-
as
we
are
taught
*NL*
that
of
a
murdered
person
often
doth
-RRB-
in
vengeance
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
the
women
made
no
other
answer
,
than
that
it
was
a
pity
it
had
*NL*
not
come
from
his
heart
,
instead
of
his
face
;
all
declaring
,
that
,
if
*NL*
their
husbands
should
lift
their
hands
against
them
,
they
would
have
*NL*
their
hearts
'
bloods
out
of
their
bodies
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
much
admonition
for
what
was
past
,
and
much
good
advice
to
Mr
*NL*
Partridge
for
his
future
behaviour
,
the
company
at
length
departed
,
*NL*
and
left
the
husband
and
wife
to
a
personal
conference
together
,
in
*NL*
which
Mr
Partridge
soon
learned
the
cause
of
all
his
sufferings
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
v.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
much
matter
to
exercise
the
judgment
and
reflection
of
the
*NL*
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
it
is
a
true
observation
,
that
few
secrets
are
divulged
to
*NL*
one
person
only
;
but
certainly
,
it
would
be
next
to
a
miracle
that
a
*NL*
fact
of
this
kind
should
be
known
to
a
whole
parish
,
and
not
transpire
*NL*
any
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
indeed
,
a
very
few
days
had
past
,
before
the
country
,
to
use
a
*NL*
common
phrase
,
rung
of
the
schoolmaster
of
Little
Baddington
;
who
was
*NL*
said
to
have
beaten
his
wife
in
the
most
cruel
manner
.
Nay
,
in
some
*NL*
places
it
was
reported
he
had
murdered
her
;
in
others
,
that
he
had
*NL*
broke
her
arms
;
in
others
,
her
legs
:
in
short
,
there
was
scarce
an
*NL*
injury
which
can
be
done
to
a
human
creature
,
but
what
Mrs
Partridge
*NL*
was
somewhere
or
other
affirmed
to
have
received
from
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cause
of
this
quarrel
was
likewise
variously
reported
;
for
as
some
*NL*
people
said
that
Mrs
Partridge
had
caught
her
husband
in
bed
with
his
*NL*
maid
,
so
many
other
reasons
,
of
a
very
different
kind
,
went
abroad
.
*NL*
Nay
,
some
transferred
the
guilt
to
the
wife
,
and
the
jealousy
to
the
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Wilkins
had
long
ago
heard
of
this
quarrel
;
but
,
as
a
different
*NL*
cause
from
the
true
one
had
reached
her
ears
,
she
thought
proper
to
*NL*
conceal
it
;
and
the
rather
,
perhaps
,
as
the
blame
was
universally
laid
*NL*
on
Mr
Partridge
;
and
his
wife
,
when
she
was
servant
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
*NL*
had
in
something
offended
Mrs
Wilkins
,
who
was
not
of
a
very
forgiving
*NL*
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs
Wilkins
,
whose
eyes
could
see
objects
at
a
distance
,
and
who
*NL*
could
very
well
look
forward
a
few
years
into
futurity
,
had
perceived
*NL*
a
strong
likelihood
of
Captain
Blifil
's
being
hereafter
her
master
;
*NL*
and
as
she
plainly
discerned
that
the
captain
bore
no
great
goodwill
*NL*
to
the
little
foundling
,
she
fancied
it
would
be
rendering
him
an
*NL*
agreeable
service
,
if
she
could
make
any
discoveries
that
might
lessen
*NL*
the
affection
which
Mr
Allworthy
seemed
to
have
contracted
for
this
*NL*
child
,
and
which
gave
visible
uneasiness
to
the
captain
,
who
could
not
*NL*
entirely
conceal
it
even
before
Allworthy
himself
;
though
his
wife
,
*NL*
who
acted
her
part
much
better
in
public
,
frequently
recommended
to
*NL*
him
her
own
example
,
of
conniving
at
the
folly
of
her
brother
,
which
,
*NL*
she
said
,
she
at
least
as
well
perceived
,
and
as
much
resented
,
as
any
*NL*
other
possibly
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Wilkins
having
therefore
,
by
accident
,
gotten
a
true
scent
of
the
*NL*
above
story
,
--
though
long
after
it
had
happened
,
failed
not
to
satisfy
*NL*
herself
thoroughly
of
all
the
particulars
;
and
then
acquainted
the
*NL*
captain
,
that
she
had
at
last
discovered
the
true
father
of
the
little
*NL*
bastard
,
which
she
was
sorry
,
she
said
,
to
see
her
master
lose
his
*NL*
reputation
in
the
country
,
by
taking
so
much
notice
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
chid
her
for
the
conclusion
of
her
speech
,
as
an
improper
*NL*
assurance
in
judging
of
her
master
's
actions
:
for
if
his
honour
,
or
*NL*
his
understanding
,
would
have
suffered
the
captain
to
make
an
alliance
*NL*
with
Mrs
Wilkins
,
his
pride
would
by
no
means
have
admitted
it
.
And
to
*NL*
say
the
truth
,
there
is
no
conduct
less
politic
,
than
to
enter
into
*NL*
any
confederacy
with
your
friend
's
servants
against
their
master
:
for
*NL*
by
these
means
you
afterwards
become
the
slave
of
these
very
servants
;
*NL*
by
whom
you
are
constantly
liable
to
be
betrayed
.
And
this
*NL*
consideration
,
perhaps
it
was
,
which
prevented
Captain
Blifil
from
*NL*
being
more
explicit
with
Mrs
Wilkins
,
or
from
encouraging
the
abuse
*NL*
which
she
had
bestowed
on
Allworthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
he
declared
no
satisfaction
to
Mrs
Wilkins
at
this
*NL*
discovery
,
he
enjoyed
not
a
little
from
it
in
his
own
mind
,
and
*NL*
resolved
to
make
the
best
use
of
it
he
was
able
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
this
matter
a
long
time
concealed
within
his
own
breast
,
in
*NL*
hopes
that
Mr
Allworthy
might
hear
it
from
some
other
person
;
but
Mrs
*NL*
Wilkins
,
whether
she
resented
the
captain
's
behaviour
,
or
whether
his
*NL*
cunning
was
beyond
her
,
and
she
feared
the
discovery
might
displease
*NL*
him
,
never
afterwards
opened
her
lips
about
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
thought
it
somewhat
strange
,
upon
reflection
,
that
the
*NL*
housekeeper
never
acquainted
Mrs
Blifil
with
this
news
,
as
women
are
*NL*
more
inclined
to
communicate
all
pieces
of
intelligence
to
their
own
*NL*
sex
,
than
to
ours
.
The
only
way
,
as
it
appears
to
me
,
of
solving
this
*NL*
difficulty
,
is
,
by
imputing
it
to
that
distance
which
was
now
grown
*NL*
between
the
lady
and
the
housekeeper
:
whether
this
arose
from
a
*NL*
jealousy
in
Mrs
Blifil
,
that
Wilkins
showed
too
great
a
respect
to
the
*NL*
foundling
;
for
while
she
was
endeavouring
to
ruin
the
little
infant
,
*NL*
in
order
to
ingratiate
herself
with
the
captain
,
she
was
every
day
*NL*
more
and
more
commending
it
before
Allworthy
,
as
his
fondness
for
it
*NL*
every
day
increased
.
This
,
notwithstanding
all
the
care
she
took
at
*NL*
other
times
to
express
the
direct
contrary
to
Mrs
Blifil
,
perhaps
*NL*
offended
that
delicate
lady
,
who
certainly
now
hated
Mrs
Wilkins
;
and
*NL*
though
she
did
not
,
or
possibly
could
not
,
absolutely
remove
her
from
*NL*
her
place
,
she
found
,
however
,
the
means
of
making
her
life
very
*NL*
uneasy
.
This
Mrs
Wilkins
,
at
length
,
so
resented
,
that
she
very
openly
*NL*
showed
all
manner
of
respect
and
fondness
to
little
Tommy
,
in
*NL*
opposition
to
Mrs
Blifil
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
therefore
,
finding
the
story
in
danger
of
perishing
,
at
*NL*
last
took
an
opportunity
to
reveal
it
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
one
day
engaged
with
Mr
Allworthy
in
a
discourse
on
charity
:
in
*NL*
which
the
captain
,
with
great
learning
,
proved
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
that
*NL*
the
word
charity
in
Scripture
nowhere
means
beneficence
or
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Christian
religion
,
''
he
said
,
``
was
instituted
for
much
nobler
*NL*
purposes
,
than
to
enforce
a
lesson
which
many
heathen
philosophers
had
*NL*
taught
us
long
before
,
and
which
,
though
it
might
perhaps
be
called
a
*NL*
moral
virtue
,
savoured
but
little
of
that
sublime
,
Christian-like
*NL*
disposition
,
that
vast
elevation
of
thought
,
in
purity
approaching
to
*NL*
angelic
perfection
,
to
be
attained
,
expressed
,
and
felt
only
by
grace
.
*NL*
Those
,
''
he
said
,
``
came
nearer
to
the
Scripture
meaning
,
who
understood
*NL*
by
it
candour
,
or
the
forming
of
a
benevolent
opinion
of
our
brethren
,
*NL*
and
passing
a
favourable
judgment
on
their
actions
;
a
virtue
much
*NL*
higher
,
and
more
extensive
in
its
nature
,
than
a
pitiful
distribution
*NL*
of
alms
,
which
,
though
we
would
never
so
much
prejudice
,
or
even
ruin
*NL*
our
families
,
could
never
reach
many
;
whereas
charity
,
in
the
other
*NL*
and
truer
sense
,
might
be
extended
to
all
mankind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
,
``
Considering
who
the
disciples
were
,
it
would
be
absurd
to
*NL*
conceive
the
doctrine
of
generosity
,
or
giving
alms
,
to
have
been
*NL*
preached
to
them
.
And
,
as
we
could
not
well
imagine
this
doctrine
*NL*
should
be
preached
by
its
Divine
Author
to
men
who
could
not
practise
*NL*
it
,
much
less
should
we
think
it
understood
so
by
those
who
can
*NL*
practise
it
,
and
do
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
though
,
''
continued
he
,
``
there
is
,
I
am
afraid
,
little
merit
in
*NL*
these
benefactions
,
there
would
,
I
must
confess
,
be
much
pleasure
in
*NL*
them
to
a
good
mind
,
if
it
was
not
abated
by
one
consideration
.
I
*NL*
mean
,
that
we
are
liable
to
be
imposed
upon
,
and
to
confer
our
*NL*
choicest
favours
often
on
the
undeserving
,
as
you
must
own
was
your
*NL*
case
in
your
bounty
to
that
worthless
fellow
Partridge
:
for
two
or
*NL*
three
such
examples
must
greatly
lessen
the
inward
satisfaction
which
*NL*
a
good
man
would
otherwise
find
in
generosity
;
nay
,
may
even
make
him
*NL*
timorous
in
bestowing
,
lest
he
should
be
guilty
of
supporting
vice
,
*NL*
and
encouraging
the
wicked
;
a
crime
of
a
very
black
dye
,
and
for
which
*NL*
it
will
by
no
means
be
a
sufficient
excuse
,
that
we
have
not
actually
*NL*
intended
such
an
encouragement
;
unless
we
have
used
the
utmost
caution
*NL*
in
chusing
the
objects
of
our
beneficence
.
A
consideration
which
,
I
*NL*
make
no
doubt
,
hath
greatly
checked
the
liberality
of
many
a
worthy
*NL*
and
pious
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
answered
,
``
He
could
not
dispute
with
the
captain
in
the
*NL*
Greek
language
,
and
therefore
could
say
nothing
as
to
the
true
sense
*NL*
of
the
word
which
is
translated
charity
;
but
that
he
had
always
*NL*
thought
it
was
interpreted
to
consist
in
action
,
and
that
giving
alms
*NL*
constituted
at
least
one
branch
of
that
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
meritorious
part
,
''
he
said
,
``
he
readily
agreed
with
the
*NL*
captain
;
for
where
could
be
the
merit
of
barely
discharging
a
duty
?
*NL*
which
,
''
he
said
,
``
let
the
word
charity
have
what
construction
it
*NL*
would
,
it
sufficiently
appeared
to
be
from
the
whole
tenor
of
the
New
*NL*
Testament
.
And
as
he
thought
it
an
indispensable
duty
,
enjoined
both
*NL*
by
the
Christian
law
,
and
by
the
law
of
nature
itself
;
so
was
it
*NL*
withal
so
pleasant
,
that
if
any
duty
could
be
said
to
be
its
own
*NL*
reward
,
or
to
pay
us
while
we
are
discharging
it
,
it
was
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
confess
the
truth
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
is
one
degree
of
generosity
*NL*
-LRB-
of
charity
I
would
have
called
it
-RRB-
,
which
seems
to
have
some
show
of
*NL*
merit
,
and
that
is
,
where
,
from
a
principle
of
benevolence
and
*NL*
Christian
love
,
we
bestow
on
another
what
we
really
want
ourselves
;
*NL*
where
,
in
order
to
lessen
the
distresses
of
another
,
we
condescend
to
*NL*
share
some
part
of
them
,
by
giving
what
even
our
own
necessities
*NL*
can
not
well
spare
.
This
is
,
I
think
,
meritorious
;
but
to
relieve
our
*NL*
brethren
only
with
our
superfluities
;
to
be
charitable
-LRB-
I
must
use
the
*NL*
word
-RRB-
rather
at
the
expense
of
our
coffers
than
ourselves
;
to
save
*NL*
several
families
from
misery
rather
than
hang
up
an
extraordinary
*NL*
picture
in
our
houses
or
gratify
any
other
idle
ridiculous
*NL*
vanity
--
this
seems
to
be
only
being
human
creatures
.
Nay
,
I
will
*NL*
venture
to
go
farther
,
it
is
being
in
some
degree
epicures
:
for
what
*NL*
could
the
greatest
epicure
wish
rather
than
to
eat
with
many
mouths
*NL*
instead
of
one
?
which
I
think
may
be
predicated
of
any
one
who
knows
*NL*
that
the
bread
of
many
is
owing
to
his
own
largesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
to
the
apprehension
of
bestowing
bounty
on
such
as
may
hereafter
*NL*
prove
unworthy
objects
,
because
many
have
proved
such
;
surely
it
can
*NL*
never
deter
a
good
man
from
generosity
.
I
do
not
think
a
few
or
many
*NL*
examples
of
ingratitude
can
justify
a
man
's
hardening
his
heart
*NL*
against
the
distresses
of
his
fellow-creatures
;
nor
do
I
believe
it
*NL*
can
ever
have
such
effect
on
a
truly
benevolent
mind
.
Nothing
less
*NL*
than
a
persuasion
of
universal
depravity
can
lock
up
the
charity
of
a
*NL*
good
man
;
and
this
persuasion
must
lead
him
,
I
think
,
either
into
*NL*
atheism
,
or
enthusiasm
;
but
surely
it
is
unfair
to
argue
such
*NL*
universal
depravity
from
a
few
vicious
individuals
;
nor
was
this
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
ever
done
by
a
man
,
who
,
upon
searching
his
own
mind
,
found
*NL*
one
certain
exception
to
the
general
rule
.
''
He
then
concluded
by
*NL*
asking
,
``
who
that
Partridge
was
,
whom
he
had
called
a
worthless
*NL*
fellow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
Partridge
the
barber
,
the
schoolmaster
,
*NL*
what
do
you
call
him
?
Partridge
,
the
father
of
the
little
child
which
*NL*
you
found
in
your
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
exprest
great
surprize
at
this
account
,
and
the
captain
*NL*
as
great
at
his
ignorance
of
it
;
for
he
said
he
had
known
it
above
a
*NL*
month
:
and
at
length
recollected
with
much
difficulty
that
he
was
told
*NL*
it
by
Mrs
Wilkins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
,
Wilkins
was
immediately
summoned
;
who
having
confirmed
what
*NL*
the
captain
had
said
,
was
by
Mr
Allworthy
,
by
and
with
the
captain
's
*NL*
advice
,
dispatched
to
Little
Baddington
,
to
inform
herself
of
the
*NL*
truth
of
the
fact
:
for
the
captain
exprest
great
dislike
at
all
hasty
*NL*
proceedings
in
criminal
matters
,
and
said
he
would
by
no
means
have
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
take
any
resolution
either
to
the
prejudice
of
the
child
or
*NL*
its
father
,
before
he
was
satisfied
that
the
latter
was
guilty
;
for
*NL*
though
he
had
privately
satisfied
himself
of
this
from
one
of
*NL*
Partridge
's
neighbours
,
yet
he
was
too
generous
to
give
any
such
*NL*
evidence
to
Mr
Allworthy
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
The
trial
of
Partridge
,
the
schoolmaster
,
for
incontinency
;
the
*NL*
evidence
of
his
wife
;
a
short
reflection
on
the
wisdom
of
our
law
;
*NL*
with
other
grave
matters
,
which
those
will
like
best
who
understand
*NL*
them
most
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
wondered
that
a
story
so
well
known
,
and
which
had
furnished
*NL*
so
much
matter
of
conversation
,
should
never
have
been
mentioned
to
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
himself
,
who
was
perhaps
the
only
person
in
that
country
who
*NL*
had
never
heard
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
account
in
some
measure
for
this
to
the
reader
,
I
think
proper
to
*NL*
inform
him
,
that
there
was
no
one
in
the
kingdom
less
interested
in
*NL*
opposing
that
doctrine
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
word
charity
,
*NL*
which
hath
been
seen
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
than
our
good
man
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
he
was
equally
intitled
to
this
virtue
in
either
sense
;
for
as
*NL*
no
man
was
ever
more
sensible
of
the
wants
,
or
more
ready
to
relieve
*NL*
the
distresses
of
others
,
so
none
could
be
more
tender
of
their
*NL*
characters
,
or
slower
to
believe
anything
to
their
disadvantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scandal
,
therefore
,
never
found
any
access
to
his
table
;
for
as
it
*NL*
hath
been
long
since
observed
that
you
may
know
a
man
by
his
*NL*
companions
,
so
I
will
venture
to
say
,
that
,
by
attending
to
the
*NL*
conversation
at
a
great
man
's
table
,
you
may
satisfy
yourself
of
his
*NL*
religion
,
his
politics
,
his
taste
,
and
indeed
of
his
entire
*NL*
disposition
:
for
though
a
few
odd
fellows
will
utter
their
own
*NL*
sentiments
in
all
places
,
yet
much
the
greater
part
of
mankind
have
*NL*
enough
of
the
courtier
to
accommodate
their
conversation
to
the
taste
*NL*
and
inclination
of
their
superiors
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
Mrs
Wilkins
,
who
,
having
executed
her
commission
with
*NL*
great
dispatch
,
though
at
fifteen
miles
distance
,
brought
back
such
a
*NL*
confirmation
of
the
schoolmaster
's
guilt
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
determined
*NL*
to
send
for
the
criminal
,
and
examine
him
_
viva
voce
_
.
Mr
Partridge
,
*NL*
therefore
,
was
summoned
to
attend
,
in
order
to
his
defence
-LRB-
if
he
*NL*
could
make
any
-RRB-
against
this
accusation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
appointed
,
before
Mr
Allworthy
himself
,
at
Paradise-hall
,
*NL*
came
as
well
the
said
Partridge
,
with
Anne
,
his
wife
,
as
Mrs
Wilkins
*NL*
his
accuser
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
Mr
Allworthy
being
seated
in
the
chair
of
justice
,
Mr
*NL*
Partridge
was
brought
before
him
.
Having
heard
his
accusation
from
the
*NL*
mouth
of
Mrs
Wilkins
,
he
pleaded
not
guilty
,
making
many
vehement
*NL*
protestations
of
his
innocence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Partridge
was
then
examined
,
who
,
after
a
modest
apology
for
being
*NL*
obliged
to
speak
the
truth
against
her
husband
,
related
all
the
*NL*
circumstances
with
which
the
reader
hath
already
been
acquainted
;
and
*NL*
at
last
concluded
with
her
husband
's
confession
of
his
guilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
she
had
forgiven
him
or
no
,
I
will
not
venture
to
determine
;
*NL*
but
it
is
certain
she
was
an
unwilling
witness
in
this
cause
;
and
it
*NL*
is
probable
from
certain
other
reasons
,
would
never
have
been
brought
*NL*
to
depose
as
she
did
,
had
not
Mrs
Wilkins
,
with
great
art
,
fished
all
*NL*
out
of
her
at
her
own
house
,
and
had
she
not
indeed
made
promises
,
in
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
's
name
,
that
the
punishment
of
her
husband
should
not
be
*NL*
such
as
might
anywise
affect
his
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
still
persisted
in
asserting
his
innocence
,
though
he
*NL*
admitted
he
had
made
the
above-mentioned
confession
;
which
he
however
*NL*
endeavoured
to
account
for
,
by
protesting
that
he
was
forced
into
it
*NL*
by
the
continued
importunity
she
used
:
who
vowed
,
that
,
as
she
was
*NL*
sure
of
his
guilt
,
she
would
never
leave
tormenting
him
till
he
had
*NL*
owned
it
;
and
faithfully
promised
,
that
,
in
such
case
,
she
would
never
*NL*
mention
it
to
him
more
.
Hence
,
he
said
,
he
had
been
induced
falsely
to
*NL*
confess
himself
guilty
,
though
he
was
innocent
;
and
that
he
believed
*NL*
he
should
have
confest
a
murder
from
the
same
motive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Partridge
could
not
bear
this
imputation
with
patience
;
and
having
*NL*
no
other
remedy
in
the
present
place
but
tears
,
she
called
forth
a
*NL*
plentiful
assistance
from
them
,
and
then
addressing
herself
to
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
she
said
-LRB-
or
rather
cried
-RRB-
,
``
May
it
please
your
worship
,
*NL*
there
never
was
any
poor
woman
so
injured
as
I
am
by
that
base
man
;
*NL*
for
this
is
not
the
only
instance
of
his
falsehood
to
me
.
No
,
may
it
*NL*
please
your
worship
,
he
hath
injured
my
bed
many
's
the
good
time
and
*NL*
often
.
I
could
have
put
up
with
his
drunkenness
and
neglect
of
his
*NL*
business
,
if
he
had
not
broke
one
of
the
sacred
commandments
.
Besides
,
*NL*
if
it
had
been
out
of
doors
I
had
not
mattered
it
so
much
;
but
with
my
*NL*
own
servant
,
in
my
own
house
,
under
my
own
roof
,
to
defile
my
own
*NL*
chaste
bed
,
which
to
be
sure
he
hath
,
with
his
beastly
stinking
*NL*
whores
.
Yes
,
you
villain
,
you
have
defiled
my
own
bed
,
you
have
;
and
*NL*
then
you
have
charged
me
with
bullocking
you
into
owning
the
truth
.
It
*NL*
is
very
likely
,
a
n't
please
your
worship
,
that
I
should
bullock
him
?
I
*NL*
have
marks
enow
about
my
body
to
show
of
his
cruelty
to
me
.
If
you
had
*NL*
been
a
man
,
you
villain
,
you
would
have
scorned
to
injure
a
woman
in
*NL*
that
manner
.
But
you
a
n't
half
a
man
,
you
know
it
.
Nor
have
you
been
*NL*
half
a
husband
to
me
.
You
need
run
after
whores
,
you
need
,
when
I
'm
*NL*
sure
--
And
since
he
provokes
me
,
I
am
ready
,
a
n't
please
your
worship
,
*NL*
to
take
my
bodily
oath
that
I
found
them
a-bed
together
.
What
,
you
*NL*
have
forgot
,
I
suppose
,
when
you
beat
me
into
a
fit
,
and
made
the
*NL*
blood
run
down
my
forehead
,
because
I
only
civilly
taxed
you
with
*NL*
adultery
!
but
I
can
prove
it
by
all
my
neighbours
.
You
have
almost
*NL*
broke
my
heart
,
you
have
,
you
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr
Allworthy
interrupted
,
and
begged
her
to
be
pacified
,
*NL*
promising
her
that
she
should
have
justice
;
then
turning
to
Partridge
,
*NL*
who
stood
aghast
,
one
half
of
his
wits
being
hurried
away
by
surprize
*NL*
and
the
other
half
by
fear
,
he
said
he
was
sorry
to
see
there
was
so
*NL*
wicked
a
man
in
the
world
.
He
assured
him
that
his
prevaricating
and
*NL*
lying
backward
and
forward
was
a
great
aggravation
of
his
guilt
;
for
*NL*
which
the
only
atonement
he
could
make
was
by
confession
and
*NL*
repentance
.
He
exhorted
him
,
therefore
,
to
begin
by
immediately
*NL*
confessing
the
fact
,
and
not
to
persist
in
denying
what
was
so
plainly
*NL*
proved
against
him
even
by
his
own
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
reader
,
I
beg
your
patience
a
moment
,
while
I
make
a
just
*NL*
compliment
to
the
great
wisdom
and
sagacity
of
our
law
,
which
refuses
*NL*
to
admit
the
evidence
of
a
wife
for
or
against
her
husband
.
This
,
says
*NL*
a
certain
learned
author
,
who
,
I
believe
,
was
never
quoted
before
in
*NL*
any
but
a
law-book
,
would
be
the
means
of
creating
an
eternal
*NL*
dissension
between
them
.
It
would
,
indeed
,
be
the
means
of
much
*NL*
perjury
,
and
of
much
whipping
,
fining
,
imprisoning
,
transporting
,
and
*NL*
hanging
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
stood
a
while
silent
,
till
,
being
bid
to
speak
,
he
said
he
*NL*
had
already
spoken
the
truth
,
and
appealed
to
Heaven
for
his
*NL*
innocence
,
and
lastly
to
the
girl
herself
,
whom
he
desired
his
worship
*NL*
immediately
to
send
for
;
for
he
was
ignorant
,
or
at
least
pretended
to
*NL*
be
so
,
that
she
had
left
that
part
of
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
,
whose
natural
love
of
justice
,
joined
to
his
coolness
of
*NL*
temper
,
made
him
always
a
most
patient
magistrate
in
hearing
all
the
*NL*
witnesses
which
an
accused
person
could
produce
in
his
defence
,
agreed
*NL*
to
defer
his
final
determination
of
this
matter
till
the
arrival
of
*NL*
Jenny
,
for
whom
he
immediately
dispatched
a
messenger
;
and
then
having
*NL*
recommended
peace
between
Partridge
and
his
wife
-LRB-
though
he
addressed
*NL*
himself
chiefly
to
the
wrong
person
-RRB-
,
he
appointed
them
to
attend
*NL*
again
the
third
day
;
for
he
had
sent
Jenny
a
whole
day
's
journey
from
*NL*
his
own
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
appointed
time
the
parties
all
assembled
,
when
the
messenger
*NL*
returning
brought
word
,
that
Jenny
was
not
to
be
found
;
for
that
she
*NL*
had
left
her
habitation
a
few
days
before
,
in
company
with
a
*NL*
recruiting
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
then
declared
that
the
evidence
of
such
a
slut
as
she
*NL*
appeared
to
be
would
have
deserved
no
credit
;
but
he
said
he
could
not
*NL*
help
thinking
that
,
had
she
been
present
,
and
would
have
declared
the
*NL*
truth
,
she
must
have
confirmed
what
so
many
circumstances
,
together
*NL*
with
his
own
confession
,
and
the
declaration
of
his
wife
that
she
had
*NL*
caught
her
husband
in
the
fact
,
did
sufficiently
prove
.
He
therefore
*NL*
once
more
exhorted
Partridge
to
confess
;
but
he
still
avowing
his
*NL*
innocence
,
Mr
Allworthy
declared
himself
satisfied
of
his
guilt
,
and
*NL*
that
he
was
too
bad
a
man
to
receive
any
encouragement
from
him
.
He
*NL*
therefore
deprived
him
of
his
annuity
,
and
recommended
repentance
to
*NL*
him
on
account
of
another
world
,
and
industry
to
maintain
himself
and
*NL*
his
wife
in
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
not
,
perhaps
,
many
more
unhappy
persons
than
poor
*NL*
Partridge
.
He
had
lost
the
best
part
of
his
income
by
the
evidence
of
*NL*
his
wife
,
and
yet
was
daily
upbraided
by
her
for
having
,
among
other
*NL*
things
,
been
the
occasion
of
depriving
her
of
that
benefit
;
but
such
*NL*
was
his
fortune
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
submit
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
I
called
him
poor
Partridge
in
the
last
paragraph
,
I
would
have
*NL*
the
reader
rather
impute
that
epithet
to
the
compassion
in
my
temper
*NL*
than
conceive
it
to
be
any
declaration
of
his
innocence
.
Whether
he
*NL*
was
innocent
or
not
will
perhaps
appear
hereafter
;
but
if
the
historic
*NL*
muse
hath
entrusted
me
with
any
secrets
,
I
will
by
no
means
be
guilty
*NL*
of
discovering
them
till
she
shall
give
me
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
therefore
the
reader
must
suspend
his
curiosity
.
Certain
it
is
*NL*
that
,
whatever
was
the
truth
of
the
case
,
there
was
evidence
more
than
*NL*
sufficient
to
convict
him
before
Allworthy
;
indeed
,
much
less
would
*NL*
have
satisfied
a
bench
of
justices
on
an
order
of
bastardy
;
and
yet
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
positiveness
of
Mrs
Partridge
,
who
would
have
*NL*
taken
the
sacrament
upon
the
matter
,
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
*NL*
schoolmaster
was
entirely
innocent
:
for
though
it
appeared
clear
on
*NL*
comparing
the
time
when
Jenny
departed
from
Little
Baddington
with
*NL*
that
of
her
delivery
that
she
had
there
conceived
this
infant
,
yet
it
*NL*
by
no
means
followed
of
necessity
that
Partridge
must
have
been
its
*NL*
father
;
for
,
to
omit
other
particulars
,
there
was
in
the
same
house
a
*NL*
lad
near
eighteen
,
between
whom
and
Jenny
there
had
subsisted
*NL*
sufficient
intimacy
to
found
a
reasonable
suspicion
;
and
yet
,
so
blind
*NL*
is
jealousy
,
this
circumstance
never
once
entered
into
the
head
of
the
*NL*
enraged
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Partridge
repented
or
not
,
according
to
Mr
Allworthy
's
advice
,
*NL*
is
not
so
apparent
.
Certain
it
is
that
his
wife
repented
heartily
of
*NL*
the
evidence
she
had
given
against
him
:
especially
when
she
found
Mrs
*NL*
Deborah
had
deceived
her
,
and
refused
to
make
any
application
to
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
on
her
behalf
.
She
had
,
however
,
somewhat
better
success
*NL*
with
Mrs
Blifil
,
who
was
,
as
the
reader
must
have
perceived
,
a
much
*NL*
better-tempered
woman
,
and
very
kindly
undertook
to
solicit
her
*NL*
brother
to
restore
the
annuity
;
in
which
,
though
good-nature
might
*NL*
have
some
share
,
yet
a
stronger
and
more
natural
motive
will
appear
in
*NL*
the
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
solicitations
were
nevertheless
unsuccessful
:
for
though
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
did
not
think
,
with
some
late
writers
,
that
mercy
consists
*NL*
only
in
punishing
offenders
;
yet
he
was
as
far
from
thinking
that
it
*NL*
is
proper
to
this
excellent
quality
to
pardon
great
criminals
*NL*
wantonly
,
without
any
reason
whatever
.
Any
doubtfulness
of
the
fact
,
*NL*
or
any
circumstance
of
mitigation
,
was
never
disregarded
:
but
the
*NL*
petitions
of
an
offender
,
or
the
intercessions
of
others
,
did
not
in
*NL*
the
least
affect
him
.
In
a
word
,
he
never
pardoned
because
the
*NL*
offender
himself
,
or
his
friends
,
were
unwilling
that
he
should
be
*NL*
punished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
and
his
wife
were
therefore
both
obliged
to
submit
to
their
*NL*
fate
;
which
was
indeed
severe
enough
:
for
so
far
was
he
from
doubling
*NL*
his
industry
on
the
account
of
his
lessened
income
,
that
he
did
in
a
*NL*
manner
abandon
himself
to
despair
;
and
as
he
was
by
nature
indolent
,
*NL*
that
vice
now
increased
upon
him
,
by
which
means
he
lost
the
little
*NL*
school
he
had
;
so
that
neither
his
wife
nor
himself
would
have
had
any
*NL*
bread
to
eat
,
had
not
the
charity
of
some
good
Christian
interposed
,
*NL*
and
provided
them
with
what
was
just
sufficient
for
their
sustenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
support
was
conveyed
to
them
by
an
unknown
hand
,
they
*NL*
imagined
,
and
so
,
I
doubt
not
,
will
the
reader
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
*NL*
himself
was
their
secret
benefactor
;
who
,
though
he
would
not
openly
*NL*
encourage
vice
,
could
yet
privately
relieve
the
distresses
of
the
*NL*
vicious
themselves
,
when
these
became
too
exquisite
and
*NL*
disproportionate
to
their
demerit
.
In
which
light
their
wretchedness
*NL*
appeared
now
to
Fortune
herself
;
for
she
at
length
took
pity
on
this
*NL*
miserable
couple
,
and
considerably
lessened
the
wretched
state
of
*NL*
Partridge
,
by
putting
a
final
end
to
that
of
his
wife
,
who
soon
after
*NL*
caught
the
small-pox
,
and
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
justice
which
Mr
Allworthy
had
executed
on
Partridge
at
first
met
*NL*
with
universal
approbation
;
but
no
sooner
had
he
felt
its
*NL*
consequences
,
than
his
neighbours
began
to
relent
,
and
to
*NL*
compassionate
his
case
;
and
presently
after
,
to
blame
that
as
rigour
*NL*
and
severity
which
they
before
called
justice
.
They
now
exclaimed
*NL*
against
punishing
in
cold
blood
,
and
sang
forth
the
praises
of
mercy
*NL*
and
forgiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
cries
were
considerably
increased
by
the
death
of
Mrs
Partridge
,
*NL*
which
,
though
owing
to
the
distemper
above
mentioned
,
which
is
no
*NL*
consequence
of
poverty
or
distress
,
many
were
not
ashamed
to
impute
to
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
's
severity
,
or
,
as
they
now
termed
it
,
cruelty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
having
now
lost
his
wife
,
his
school
,
and
his
annuity
,
and
*NL*
the
unknown
person
having
now
discontinued
the
last-mentioned
charity
,
*NL*
resolved
to
change
the
scene
,
and
left
the
country
,
where
he
was
in
*NL*
danger
of
starving
,
with
the
universal
compassion
of
all
his
*NL*
neighbours
.

*NL*
Chapter
vii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
sketch
of
that
felicity
which
prudent
couples
may
extract
from
*NL*
hatred
:
with
a
short
apology
for
those
people
who
overlook
*NL*
imperfections
in
their
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
captain
had
effectually
demolished
poor
Partridge
,
yet
had
*NL*
he
not
reaped
the
harvest
he
hoped
for
,
which
was
to
turn
the
*NL*
foundling
out
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
that
gentleman
grew
every
day
fonder
of
little
Tommy
,
*NL*
as
if
he
intended
to
counterbalance
his
severity
to
the
father
with
*NL*
extraordinary
fondness
and
affection
towards
the
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
a
good
deal
soured
the
captain
's
temper
,
as
did
all
the
other
*NL*
daily
instances
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
generosity
;
for
he
looked
on
all
*NL*
such
largesses
to
be
diminutions
of
his
own
wealth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
,
we
have
said
,
he
did
not
agree
with
his
wife
;
nor
,
indeed
,
in
*NL*
anything
else
:
for
though
an
affection
placed
on
the
understanding
is
,
*NL*
by
many
wise
persons
,
thought
more
durable
than
that
which
is
founded
*NL*
on
beauty
,
yet
it
happened
otherwise
in
the
present
case
.
Nay
,
the
*NL*
understandings
of
this
couple
were
their
principal
bone
of
contention
,
*NL*
and
one
great
cause
of
many
quarrels
,
which
from
time
to
time
arose
*NL*
between
them
;
and
which
at
last
ended
,
on
the
side
of
the
lady
,
in
a
*NL*
sovereign
contempt
for
her
husband
;
and
on
the
husband
's
,
in
an
utter
*NL*
abhorrence
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
these
had
both
exercised
their
talents
chiefly
in
the
study
of
*NL*
divinity
,
this
was
,
from
their
first
acquaintance
,
the
most
common
*NL*
topic
of
conversation
between
them
.
The
captain
,
like
a
well-bred
man
,
*NL*
had
,
before
marriage
,
always
given
up
his
opinion
to
that
of
the
lady
;
*NL*
and
this
,
not
in
the
clumsy
awkward
manner
of
a
conceited
blockhead
,
*NL*
who
,
while
he
civilly
yields
to
a
superior
in
an
argument
,
is
desirous
*NL*
of
being
still
known
to
think
himself
in
the
right
.
The
captain
,
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
though
one
of
the
proudest
fellows
in
the
world
,
so
*NL*
absolutely
yielded
the
victory
to
his
antagonist
,
that
she
,
who
had
*NL*
not
the
least
doubt
of
his
sincerity
,
retired
always
from
the
dispute
*NL*
with
an
admiration
of
her
own
understanding
and
a
love
for
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
this
complacence
to
one
whom
the
captain
thoroughly
*NL*
despised
,
was
not
so
uneasy
to
him
as
it
would
have
been
had
any
hopes
*NL*
of
preferment
made
it
necessary
to
show
the
same
submission
to
a
*NL*
Hoadley
,
or
to
some
other
of
great
reputation
in
the
science
,
yet
even
*NL*
this
cost
him
too
much
to
be
endured
without
some
motive
.
Matrimony
,
*NL*
therefore
,
having
removed
all
such
motives
,
he
grew
weary
of
this
*NL*
condescension
,
and
began
to
treat
the
opinions
of
his
wife
with
that
*NL*
haughtiness
and
insolence
,
which
none
but
those
who
deserve
some
*NL*
contempt
themselves
can
bestow
,
and
those
only
who
deserve
no
contempt
*NL*
can
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
first
torrent
of
tenderness
was
over
,
and
when
,
in
the
calm
*NL*
and
long
interval
between
the
fits
,
reason
began
to
open
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
lady
,
and
she
saw
this
alteration
of
behaviour
in
the
captain
,
who
*NL*
at
length
answered
all
her
arguments
only
with
pish
and
pshaw
,
she
was
*NL*
far
from
enduring
the
indignity
with
a
tame
submission
.
Indeed
,
it
at
*NL*
first
so
highly
provoked
her
,
that
it
might
have
produced
some
*NL*
tragical
event
,
had
it
not
taken
a
more
harmless
turn
,
by
filling
her
*NL*
with
the
utmost
contempt
for
her
husband
's
understanding
,
which
*NL*
somewhat
qualified
her
hatred
towards
him
;
though
of
this
likewise
she
*NL*
had
a
pretty
moderate
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
's
hatred
to
her
was
of
a
purer
kind
:
for
as
to
any
*NL*
imperfections
in
her
knowledge
or
understanding
,
he
no
more
despised
*NL*
her
for
them
,
than
for
her
not
being
six
feet
high
.
In
his
opinion
of
*NL*
the
female
sex
,
he
exceeded
the
moroseness
of
Aristotle
himself
:
he
*NL*
looked
on
a
woman
as
on
an
animal
of
domestic
use
,
of
somewhat
higher
*NL*
consideration
than
a
cat
,
since
her
offices
were
of
rather
more
*NL*
importance
;
but
the
difference
between
these
two
was
,
in
his
*NL*
estimation
,
so
small
,
that
,
in
his
marriage
contracted
with
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
's
lands
and
tenements
,
it
would
have
been
pretty
equal
which
*NL*
of
them
he
had
taken
into
the
bargain
.
And
yet
so
tender
was
his
*NL*
pride
,
that
it
felt
the
contempt
which
his
wife
now
began
to
express
*NL*
towards
him
;
and
this
,
added
to
the
surfeit
he
had
before
taken
of
her
*NL*
love
,
created
in
him
a
degree
of
disgust
and
abhorrence
,
perhaps
*NL*
hardly
to
be
exceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
situation
only
of
the
married
state
is
excluded
from
pleasure
:
and
*NL*
that
is
,
a
state
of
indifference
:
but
as
many
of
my
readers
,
I
hope
,
*NL*
know
what
an
exquisite
delight
there
is
in
conveying
pleasure
to
a
*NL*
beloved
object
,
so
some
few
,
I
am
afraid
,
may
have
experienced
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
tormenting
one
we
hate
.
It
is
,
I
apprehend
,
to
come
at
*NL*
this
latter
pleasure
,
that
we
see
both
sexes
often
give
up
that
ease
*NL*
in
marriage
which
they
might
otherwise
possess
,
though
their
mate
was
*NL*
never
so
disagreeable
to
them
.
Hence
the
wife
often
puts
on
fits
of
*NL*
love
and
jealousy
,
nay
,
even
denies
herself
any
pleasure
,
to
disturb
*NL*
and
prevent
those
of
her
husband
;
and
he
again
,
in
return
,
puts
*NL*
frequent
restraints
on
himself
,
and
stays
at
home
in
company
which
he
*NL*
dislikes
,
in
order
to
confine
his
wife
to
what
she
equally
detests
.
*NL*
Hence
,
too
,
must
flow
those
tears
which
a
widow
sometimes
so
*NL*
plentifully
sheds
over
the
ashes
of
a
husband
with
whom
she
led
a
life
*NL*
of
constant
disquiet
and
turbulency
,
and
whom
now
she
can
never
hope
*NL*
to
torment
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
ever
any
couple
enjoyed
this
pleasure
,
it
was
at
present
*NL*
experienced
by
the
captain
and
his
lady
.
It
was
always
a
sufficient
*NL*
reason
to
either
of
them
to
be
obstinate
in
any
opinion
,
that
the
*NL*
other
had
previously
asserted
the
contrary
.
If
the
one
proposed
any
*NL*
amusement
,
the
other
constantly
objected
to
it
:
they
never
loved
or
*NL*
hated
,
commended
or
abused
,
the
same
person
.
And
for
this
reason
,
as
*NL*
the
captain
looked
with
an
evil
eye
on
the
little
foundling
,
his
wife
*NL*
began
now
to
caress
it
almost
equally
with
her
own
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
be
apt
to
conceive
,
that
this
behaviour
between
the
*NL*
husband
and
wife
did
not
greatly
contribute
to
Mr
Allworthy
's
repose
,
*NL*
as
it
tended
so
little
to
that
serene
happiness
which
he
had
designed
*NL*
for
all
three
from
this
alliance
;
but
the
truth
is
,
though
he
might
be
*NL*
a
little
disappointed
in
his
sanguine
expectations
,
yet
he
was
far
*NL*
from
being
acquainted
with
the
whole
matter
;
for
,
as
the
captain
was
,
*NL*
from
certain
obvious
reasons
,
much
on
his
guard
before
him
,
the
lady
*NL*
was
obliged
,
for
fear
of
her
brother
's
displeasure
,
to
pursue
the
same
*NL*
conduct
.
In
fact
,
it
is
possible
for
a
third
person
to
be
very
*NL*
intimate
,
nay
even
to
live
long
in
the
same
house
,
with
a
married
*NL*
couple
,
who
have
any
tolerable
discretion
,
and
not
even
guess
at
the
*NL*
sour
sentiments
which
they
bear
to
each
other
:
for
though
the
whole
*NL*
day
may
be
sometimes
too
short
for
hatred
,
as
well
as
for
love
;
yet
*NL*
the
many
hours
which
they
naturally
spend
together
,
apart
from
all
*NL*
observers
,
furnish
people
of
tolerable
moderation
with
such
ample
*NL*
opportunity
for
the
enjoyment
of
either
passion
,
that
,
if
they
love
,
*NL*
they
can
support
being
a
few
hours
in
company
without
toying
,
or
if
*NL*
they
hate
,
without
spitting
in
each
other
's
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
possible
,
however
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
saw
enough
to
render
him
a
*NL*
little
uneasy
;
for
we
are
not
always
to
conclude
,
that
a
wise
man
is
*NL*
not
hurt
,
because
he
doth
not
cry
out
and
lament
himself
,
like
those
*NL*
of
a
childish
or
effeminate
temper
.
But
indeed
it
is
possible
he
might
*NL*
see
some
faults
in
the
captain
without
any
uneasiness
at
all
;
for
men
*NL*
of
true
wisdom
and
goodness
are
contented
to
take
persons
and
things
*NL*
as
they
are
,
without
complaining
of
their
imperfections
,
or
attempting
*NL*
to
amend
them
.
They
can
see
a
fault
in
a
friend
,
a
relation
,
or
an
*NL*
acquaintance
,
without
ever
mentioning
it
to
the
parties
themselves
,
or
*NL*
to
any
others
;
and
this
often
without
lessening
their
affection
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
unless
great
discernment
be
tempered
with
this
overlooking
*NL*
disposition
,
we
ought
never
to
contract
friendship
but
with
a
degree
*NL*
of
folly
which
we
can
deceive
;
for
I
hope
my
friends
will
pardon
me
*NL*
when
I
declare
,
I
know
none
of
them
without
a
fault
;
and
I
should
be
*NL*
sorry
if
I
could
imagine
I
had
any
friend
who
could
not
see
mine
.
*NL*
Forgiveness
of
this
kind
we
give
and
demand
in
turn
.
It
is
an
exercise
*NL*
of
friendship
,
and
perhaps
none
of
the
least
pleasant
.
And
this
*NL*
forgiveness
we
must
bestow
,
without
desire
of
amendment
.
There
is
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
no
surer
mark
of
folly
,
than
an
attempt
to
correct
the
*NL*
natural
infirmities
of
those
we
love
.
The
finest
composition
of
human
*NL*
nature
,
as
well
as
the
finest
china
,
may
have
a
flaw
in
it
;
and
this
,
*NL*
I
am
afraid
,
in
either
case
,
is
equally
incurable
;
though
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
the
pattern
may
remain
of
the
highest
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
whole
,
then
,
Mr
Allworthy
certainly
saw
some
imperfections
in
*NL*
the
captain
;
but
as
this
was
a
very
artful
man
,
and
eternally
upon
his
*NL*
guard
before
him
,
these
appeared
to
him
no
more
than
blemishes
in
a
*NL*
good
character
,
which
his
goodness
made
him
overlook
,
and
his
wisdom
*NL*
prevented
him
from
discovering
to
the
captain
himself
.
Very
different
*NL*
would
have
been
his
sentiments
had
he
discovered
the
whole
;
which
*NL*
perhaps
would
in
time
have
been
the
case
,
had
the
husband
and
wife
*NL*
long
continued
this
kind
of
behaviour
to
each
other
;
but
this
kind
*NL*
Fortune
took
effectual
means
to
prevent
,
by
forcing
the
captain
to
do
*NL*
that
which
rendered
him
again
dear
to
his
wife
,
and
restored
all
her
*NL*
tenderness
and
affection
towards
him
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
A
receipt
to
regain
the
lost
affections
of
a
wife
,
which
hath
never
*NL*
been
known
to
fail
in
the
most
desperate
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
made
large
amends
for
the
unpleasant
minutes
which
he
*NL*
passed
in
the
conversation
of
his
wife
-LRB-
and
which
were
as
few
as
he
*NL*
could
contrive
to
make
them
-RRB-
,
by
the
pleasant
meditations
he
enjoyed
*NL*
when
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
meditations
were
entirely
employed
on
Mr
Allworthy
's
fortune
;
*NL*
for
,
first
,
he
exercised
much
thought
in
calculating
,
as
well
as
he
*NL*
could
,
the
exact
value
of
the
whole
:
which
calculations
he
often
saw
*NL*
occasion
to
alter
in
his
own
favour
:
and
,
secondly
and
chiefly
,
he
*NL*
pleased
himself
with
intended
alterations
in
the
house
and
gardens
,
*NL*
and
in
projecting
many
other
schemes
,
as
well
for
the
improvement
of
*NL*
the
estate
as
of
the
grandeur
of
the
place
:
for
this
purpose
he
*NL*
applied
himself
to
the
studies
of
architecture
and
gardening
,
and
read
*NL*
over
many
books
on
both
these
subjects
;
for
these
sciences
,
indeed
,
*NL*
employed
his
whole
time
,
and
formed
his
only
amusement
.
He
at
last
*NL*
completed
a
most
excellent
plan
:
and
very
sorry
we
are
,
that
it
is
not
*NL*
in
our
power
to
present
it
to
our
reader
,
since
even
the
luxury
of
the
*NL*
present
age
,
I
believe
,
would
hardly
match
it
.
It
had
,
indeed
,
in
a
*NL*
superlative
degree
,
the
two
principal
ingredients
which
serve
to
*NL*
recommend
all
great
and
noble
designs
of
this
nature
;
for
it
required
*NL*
an
immoderate
expense
to
execute
,
and
a
vast
length
of
time
to
bring
*NL*
it
to
any
sort
of
perfection
.
The
former
of
these
,
the
immense
wealth
*NL*
of
which
the
captain
supposed
Mr
Allworthy
possessed
,
and
which
he
*NL*
thought
himself
sure
of
inheriting
,
promised
very
effectually
to
*NL*
supply
;
and
the
latter
,
the
soundness
of
his
own
constitution
,
and
his
*NL*
time
of
life
,
which
was
only
what
is
called
middle-age
,
removed
all
*NL*
apprehension
of
his
not
living
to
accomplish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
was
wanting
to
enable
him
to
enter
upon
the
immediate
*NL*
execution
of
this
plan
,
but
the
death
of
Mr
Allworthy
;
in
calculating
*NL*
which
he
had
employed
much
of
his
own
algebra
,
besides
purchasing
*NL*
every
book
extant
that
treats
of
the
value
of
lives
,
reversions
,
&
c.
*NL*
From
all
which
he
satisfied
himself
,
that
as
he
had
every
day
a
chance
*NL*
of
this
happening
,
so
had
he
more
than
an
even
chance
of
its
happening
*NL*
within
a
few
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
while
the
captain
was
one
day
busied
in
deep
contemplations
of
*NL*
this
kind
,
one
of
the
most
unlucky
as
well
as
unseasonable
accidents
*NL*
happened
to
him
.
The
utmost
malice
of
Fortune
could
,
indeed
,
have
*NL*
contrived
nothing
so
cruel
,
so
mal-a-propos
,
so
absolutely
destructive
*NL*
to
all
his
schemes
.
In
short
,
not
to
keep
the
reader
in
long
suspense
,
*NL*
just
at
the
very
instant
when
his
heart
was
exulting
in
meditations
on
*NL*
the
happiness
which
would
accrue
to
him
by
Mr
Allworthy
's
death
,
he
*NL*
himself
--
died
of
an
apoplexy
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unfortunately
befel
the
captain
as
he
was
taking
his
evening
walk
*NL*
by
himself
,
so
that
nobody
was
present
to
lend
him
any
assistance
,
if
*NL*
indeed
,
any
assistance
could
have
preserved
him
.
He
took
,
therefore
,
*NL*
measure
of
that
proportion
of
soil
which
was
now
become
adequate
to
*NL*
all
his
future
purposes
,
and
he
lay
dead
on
the
ground
,
a
great
*NL*
-LRB-
though
not
a
living
-RRB-
example
of
the
truth
of
that
observation
of
*NL*
Horace
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
Tu
secanda
marmora
*NL*
Locas
sub
ipsum
funus
;
et

Immemor

_
*NL*
*NL*
Which
sentiment
I
shall
thus
give
to
the
English
reader
:
``
You
provide
*NL*
the
noblest
materials
for
building

when
a
pickaxe
and
a

are
*NL*
only
necessary

and
build

of
five
hundred

forgetting
that
of

two

A
proof
of
the
infallibility
of
the
foregoing
receipt
,
in
the
*NL*
lamentations
of
the
widow
;
with
other
suitable
decorations
of
death
,
*NL*
such
as
physicians
,
&
c.
,
and
an
epitaph
in
the
true
stile
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
,
his
sister
,
and
another
lady
,
were
assembled
at
the
*NL*
accustomed
hour
in
the
supper-room
,
where
,
having
waited
a
*NL*
considerable
time
longer
than
usual
,
Mr
Allworthy
first
declared
he
*NL*
began
to
grow
uneasy
at
the
captain
's
stay
-LRB-
for
he
was
always
most
*NL*
punctual
at
his
meals
-RRB-
;
and
gave
orders
that
the
bell
should
be
rung
*NL*
without
the
doors
,
and
especially
towards
those
walks
which
the
*NL*
captain
was
wont
to
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
summons
proving
ineffectual
-LRB-
for
the
captain
had
,
by
*NL*
perverse
accident
,
betaken
himself
to
a
new
walk
that
evening
-RRB-
,
Mrs
*NL*
Blifil
declared
she
was
seriously
frightened
.
Upon
which
the
other
*NL*
lady
,
who
was
one
of
her
most
intimate
acquaintance
,
and
who
well
knew
*NL*
the
true
state
of
her
affections
,
endeavoured
all
she
could
to
pacify
*NL*
her
,
telling
her
--
To
be
sure
she
could
not
help
being
uneasy
;
but
that
*NL*
she
should
hope
the
best
.
That
,
perhaps
the
sweetness
of
the
evening
*NL*
had
inticed
the
captain
to
go
farther
than
his
usual
walk
:
or
he
might
*NL*
be
detained
at
some
neighbour
's
.
Mrs
Blifil
answered
,
No
;
she
was
sure
*NL*
some
accident
had
befallen
him
;
for
that
he
would
never
stay
out
*NL*
without
sending
her
word
,
as
he
must
know
how
uneasy
it
would
make
*NL*
her
.
The
other
lady
,
having
no
other
arguments
to
use
,
betook
herself
*NL*
to
the
entreaties
usual
on
such
occasions
,
and
begged
her
not
to
*NL*
frighten
herself
,
for
it
might
be
of
very
ill
consequence
to
her
own
*NL*
health
;
and
,
filling
out
a
very
large
glass
of
wine
,
advised
,
and
at
*NL*
last
prevailed
with
her
to
drink
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
now
returned
into
the
parlour
;
for
he
had
been
himself
in
*NL*
search
after
the
captain
.
His
countenance
sufficiently
showed
the
*NL*
consternation
he
was
under
,
which
,
indeed
,
had
a
good
deal
deprived
*NL*
him
of
speech
;
but
as
grief
operates
variously
on
different
minds
,
so
*NL*
the
same
apprehension
which
depressed
his
voice
,
elevated
that
of
Mrs
*NL*
Blifil
.
She
now
began
to
bewail
herself
in
very
bitter
terms
,
and
*NL*
floods
of
tears
accompanied
her
lamentations
;
which
the
lady
,
her
*NL*
companion
,
declared
she
could
not
blame
,
but
at
the
same
time
*NL*
dissuaded
her
from
indulging
;
attempting
to
moderate
the
grief
of
her
*NL*
friend
by
philosophical
observations
on
the
many
disappointments
to
*NL*
which
human
life
is
daily
subject
,
which
,
she
said
,
was
a
sufficient
*NL*
consideration
to
fortify
our
minds
against
any
accidents
,
how
sudden
*NL*
or
terrible
soever
.
She
said
her
brother
's
example
ought
to
teach
her
*NL*
patience
,
who
,
though
indeed
he
could
not
be
supposed
as
much
*NL*
concerned
as
herself
,
yet
was
,
doubtless
,
very
uneasy
,
though
his
*NL*
resignation
to
the
Divine
will
had
restrained
his
grief
within
due
*NL*
bounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mention
not
my
brother
,
''
said
Mrs
Blifil
;
``
I
alone
am
the
object
of
*NL*
your
pity
.
What
are
the
terrors
of
friendship
to
what
a
wife
feels
on
*NL*
these
occasions
?
Oh
,
he
is
lost
!
Somebody
hath
murdered
him
--
I
shall
*NL*
never
see
him
more
!
''
--
Here
a
torrent
of
tears
had
the
same
consequence
*NL*
with
what
the
suppression
had
occasioned
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
she
*NL*
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
interval
a
servant
came
running
in
,
out
of
breath
,
and
cried
*NL*
out
,
The
captain
was
found
;
and
,
before
he
could
proceed
farther
,
he
*NL*
was
followed
by
two
more
,
bearing
the
dead
body
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
curious
reader
may
observe
another
diversity
in
the
*NL*
operations
of
grief
:
for
as
Mr
Allworthy
had
been
before
silent
,
from
*NL*
the
same
cause
which
had
made
his
sister
vociferous
;
so
did
the
*NL*
present
sight
,
which
drew
tears
from
the
gentleman
,
put
an
entire
stop
*NL*
to
those
of
the
lady
;
who
first
gave
a
violent
scream
,
and
presently
*NL*
after
fell
into
a
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
soon
full
of
servants
,
some
of
whom
,
with
the
lady
*NL*
visitant
,
were
employed
in
care
of
the
wife
;
and
others
,
with
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
assisted
in
carrying
off
the
captain
to
a
warm
bed
;
where
*NL*
every
method
was
tried
,
in
order
to
restore
him
to
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
glad
should
we
be
,
could
we
inform
the
reader
that
both
these
*NL*
bodies
had
been
attended
with
equal
success
;
for
those
who
undertook
*NL*
the
care
of
the
lady
succeeded
so
well
,
that
,
after
the
fit
had
*NL*
continued
a
decent
time
,
she
again
revived
,
to
their
great
*NL*
satisfaction
:
but
as
to
the
captain
,
all
experiments
of
bleeding
,
*NL*
chafing
,
dropping
,
&
c.
,
proved
ineffectual
.
Death
,
that
inexorable
*NL*
judge
,
had
passed
sentence
on
him
,
and
refused
to
grant
him
a
*NL*
reprieve
,
though
two
doctors
who
arrived
,
and
were
fee
'd
at
one
and
*NL*
the
same
instant
,
were
his
counsel
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
doctors
,
whom
,
to
avoid
any
malicious
applications
,
we
shall
*NL*
distinguish
by
the
names
of
Dr
Y.
and
Dr
Z.
,
having
felt
his
pulse
;
to
*NL*
wit
,
Dr
Y.
his
right
arm
,
and
Dr
Z.
his
left
;
both
agreed
that
he
was
*NL*
absolutely
dead
;
but
as
to
the
distemper
,
or
cause
of
his
death
,
they
*NL*
differed
;
Dr
Y.
holding
that
he
died
of
an
apoplexy
,
and
Dr
Z.
of
an
*NL*
epilepsy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
arose
a
dispute
between
the
learned
men
,
in
which
each
delivered
*NL*
the
reasons
of
their
several
opinions
.
These
were
of
such
equal
force
,
*NL*
that
they
served
both
to
confirm
either
doctor
in
his
own
sentiments
,
*NL*
and
made
not
the
least
impression
on
his
adversary
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
every
physician
almost
hath
his
favourite
disease
,
*NL*
to
which
he
ascribes
all
the
victories
obtained
over
human
nature
.
The
*NL*
gout
,
the
rheumatism
,
the
stone
,
the
gravel
,
and
the
consumption
,
have
*NL*
all
their
several
patrons
in
the
faculty
;
and
none
more
than
the
*NL*
nervous
fever
,
or
the
fever
on
the
spirits
.
And
here
we
may
account
*NL*
for
those
disagreements
in
opinion
,
concerning
the
cause
of
a
*NL*
patient
's
death
,
which
sometimes
occur
,
between
the
most
learned
of
*NL*
the
college
;
and
which
have
greatly
surprized
that
part
of
the
world
*NL*
who
have
been
ignorant
of
the
fact
we
have
above
asserted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
perhaps
be
surprized
,
that
,
instead
of
endeavouring
to
*NL*
revive
the
patient
,
the
learned
gentlemen
should
fall
immediately
into
*NL*
a
dispute
on
the
occasion
of
his
death
;
but
in
reality
all
such
*NL*
experiments
had
been
made
before
their
arrival
:
for
the
captain
was
*NL*
put
into
a
warm
bed
,
had
his
veins
scarified
,
his
forehead
chafed
,
and
*NL*
all
sorts
of
strong
drops
applied
to
his
lips
and
nostrils
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
physicians
,
therefore
,
finding
themselves
anticipated
in
*NL*
everything
they
ordered
,
were
at
a
loss
how
to
apply
that
portion
of
*NL*
time
which
it
is
usual
and
decent
to
remain
for
their
fee
,
and
were
*NL*
therefore
necessitated
to
find
some
subject
or
other
for
discourse
;
*NL*
and
what
could
more
naturally
present
itself
than
that
before
*NL*
mentioned
?
*NL*
*NL*
Our
doctors
were
about
to
take
their
leave
,
when
Mr
Allworthy
,
having
*NL*
given
over
the
captain
,
and
acquiesced
in
the
Divine
will
,
began
to
*NL*
enquire
after
his
sister
,
whom
he
desired
them
to
visit
before
their
*NL*
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
lady
was
now
recovered
of
her
fit
,
and
,
to
use
the
common
phrase
,
*NL*
as
well
as
could
be
expected
for
one
in
her
condition
.
The
doctors
,
*NL*
therefore
,
all
previous
ceremonies
being
complied
with
,
as
this
was
a
*NL*
new
patient
,
attended
,
according
to
desire
,
and
laid
hold
on
each
of
*NL*
her
hands
,
as
they
had
before
done
on
those
of
the
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
of
the
lady
was
in
the
other
extreme
from
that
of
her
*NL*
husband
:
for
as
he
was
past
all
the
assistance
of
physic
,
so
in
*NL*
reality
she
required
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
more
unjust
than
the
vulgar
opinion
,
by
which
*NL*
physicians
are
misrepresented
,
as
friends
to
death
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
if
the
number
of
those
who
recover
by
physic
could
be
opposed
*NL*
to
that
of
the
martyrs
to
it
,
the
former
would
rather
exceed
the
*NL*
latter
.
Nay
,
some
are
so
cautious
on
this
head
,
that
,
to
avoid
a
*NL*
possibility
of
killing
the
patient
,
they
abstain
from
all
methods
of
*NL*
curing
,
and
prescribe
nothing
but
what
can
neither
do
good
nor
harm
.
I
*NL*
have
heard
some
of
these
,
with
great
gravity
,
deliver
it
as
a
maxim
,
*NL*
``
That
Nature
should
be
left
to
do
her
own
work
,
while
the
physician
*NL*
stands
by
as
it
were
to
clap
her
on
the
back
,
and
encourage
her
when
*NL*
she
doth
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
little
then
did
our
doctors
delight
in
death
,
that
they
discharged
*NL*
the
corpse
after
a
single
fee
;
but
they
were
not
so
disgusted
with
*NL*
their
living
patient
;
concerning
whose
case
they
immediately
agreed
,
*NL*
and
fell
to
prescribing
with
great
diligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
,
as
the
lady
had
at
first
persuaded
her
physicians
to
believe
*NL*
her
ill
,
they
had
now
,
in
return
,
persuaded
her
to
believe
herself
so
,
*NL*
I
will
not
determine
;
but
she
continued
a
whole
month
with
all
the
*NL*
decorations
of
sickness
.
During
this
time
she
was
visited
by
*NL*
physicians
,
attended
by
nurses
,
and
received
constant
messages
from
*NL*
her
acquaintance
to
enquire
after
her
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
decent
time
for
sickness
and
immoderate
grief
being
*NL*
expired
,
the
doctors
were
discharged
,
and
the
lady
began
to
see
*NL*
company
;
being
altered
only
from
what
she
was
before
,
by
that
colour
*NL*
of
sadness
in
which
she
had
dressed
her
person
and
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
now
interred
,
and
might
,
perhaps
,
have
already
made
a
*NL*
large
progress
towards
oblivion
,
had
not
the
friendship
of
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
taken
care
to
preserve
his
memory
,
by
the
following
epitaph
,
*NL*
which
was
written
by
a
man
of
as
great
genius
as
integrity
,
and
one
*NL*
who
perfectly
well
knew
the
captain
.

CONTAINING
THE
MOST
MEMORABLE
TRANSACTIONS
WHICH
PASSED
IN

FAMILY
*NL*
OF
MR
ALLWORTHY
,
FROM
THE
TIME
WHEN
TOMMY
JONES
ARRIVED
AT
THE
AGE
OF

FOURTEEN
,
TILL
HE
ATTAINED
THE
AGE
OF
NINETEEN
.
IN
THIS
BOOK
THE
*NL*
READER
MAY
PICK
UP
SOME
HINTS
CONCERNING
THE
EDUCATION
OF
CHILDREN
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
little
or
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
be
pleased
to
remember
,
that
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
second
book
of
this
history
,
we
gave
him
a
hint
of
our
intention
to
*NL*
pass
over
several
large
periods
of
time
,
in
which
nothing
happened
*NL*
worthy
of
being
recorded
in
a
chronicle
of
this
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
so
doing
,
we
do
not
only
consult
our
own
dignity
and
ease
,
but
the
*NL*
good
and
advantage
of
the
reader
:
for
besides
that
by
these
means
we
*NL*
prevent
him
from
throwing
away
his
time
,
in
reading
without
either
*NL*
pleasure
or
emolument
,
we
give
him
,
at
all
such
seasons
,
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
employing
that
wonderful
sagacity
,
of
which
he
is
*NL*
master
,
by
filling
up
these
vacant
spaces
of
time
with
his
own
*NL*
conjectures
;
for
which
purpose
we
have
taken
care
to
qualify
him
in
*NL*
the
preceding
pages
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
instance
,
what
reader
but
knows
that
Mr
Allworthy
felt
,
at
first
,
*NL*
for
the
loss
of
his
friend
,
those
emotions
of
grief
,
which
on
such
*NL*
occasions
enter
into
all
men
whose
hearts
are
not
composed
of
flint
,
*NL*
or
their
heads
of
as
solid
materials
?
Again
,
what
reader
doth
not
know
*NL*
that
philosophy
and
religion
in
time
moderated
,
and
at
last
*NL*
extinguished
,
this
grief
?
The
former
of
these
teaching
the
folly
and
*NL*
vanity
of
it
,
and
the
latter
correcting
it
as
unlawful
,
and
at
the
*NL*
same
time
assuaging
it
,
by
raising
future
hopes
and
assurances
,
which
*NL*
enable
a
strong
and
religious
mind
to
take
leave
of
a
friend
,
on
his
*NL*
deathbed
,
with
little
less
indifference
than
if
he
was
preparing
for
a
*NL*
long
journey
;
and
,
indeed
,
with
little
less
hope
of
seeing
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
can
the
judicious
reader
be
at
a
greater
loss
on
account
of
Mrs
*NL*
Bridget
Blifil
,
who
,
he
may
be
assured
,
conducted
herself
through
the
*NL*
whole
season
in
which
grief
is
to
make
its
appearance
on
the
outside
*NL*
of
the
body
,
with
the
strictest
regard
to
all
the
rules
of
custom
and
*NL*
decency
,
suiting
the
alterations
of
her
countenance
to
the
several
*NL*
alterations
of
her
habit
:
for
as
this
changed
from
weeds
to
black
,
*NL*
from
black
to
grey
,
from
grey
to
white
,
so
did
her
countenance
change
*NL*
from
dismal
to
sorrowful
,
from
sorrowful
to
sad
,
and
from
sad
to
*NL*
serious
,
till
the
day
came
in
which
she
was
allowed
to
return
to
her
*NL*
former
serenity
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
mentioned
these
two
,
as
examples
only
of
the
task
which
may
be
*NL*
imposed
on
readers
of
the
lowest
class
.
Much
higher
and
harder
*NL*
exercises
of
judgment
and
penetration
may
reasonably
be
expected
from
*NL*
the
upper
graduates
in
criticism
.
Many
notable
discoveries
will
,
I
*NL*
doubt
not
,
be
made
by
such
,
of
the
transactions
which
happened
in
the
*NL*
family
of
our
worthy
man
,
during
all
the
years
which
we
have
thought
*NL*
proper
to
pass
over
:
for
though
nothing
worthy
of
a
place
in
this
*NL*
history
occurred
within
that
period
,
yet
did
several
incidents
happen
*NL*
of
equal
importance
with
those
reported
by
the
daily
and
weekly
*NL*
historians
of
the
age
;
in
reading
which
great
numbers
of
persons
*NL*
consume
a
considerable
part
of
their
time
,
very
little
,
I
am
afraid
,
*NL*
to
their
emolument
.
Now
,
in
the
conjectures
here
proposed
,
some
of
the
*NL*
most
excellent
faculties
of
the
mind
may
be
employed
to
much
*NL*
advantage
,
since
it
is
a
more
useful
capacity
to
be
able
to
foretel
*NL*
the
actions
of
men
,
in
any
circumstance
,
from
their
characters
,
than
*NL*
to
judge
of
their
characters
from
their
actions
.
The
former
,
I
own
,
*NL*
requires
the
greater
penetration
;
but
may
be
accomplished
by
true
*NL*
sagacity
with
no
less
certainty
than
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
are
sensible
that
much
the
greatest
part
of
our
readers
are
very
*NL*
eminently
possessed
of
this
quality
,
we
have
left
them
a
space
of
*NL*
twelve
years
to
exert
it
in
;
and
shall
now
bring
forth
our
heroe
,
at
*NL*
about
fourteen
years
of
age
,
not
questioning
that
many
have
been
long
*NL*
impatient
to
be
introduced
to
his
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
ii
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
heroe
of
this
great
history
appears
with
very
bad
omens
.
A
little
*NL*
tale
of
so
LOW
a
kind
that
some
may
think
it
not
worth
their
notice
.
A
*NL*
word
or
two
concerning
a
squire
,
and
more
relating
to
a
gamekeeper
and
*NL*
a
schoolmaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
determined
,
when
we
first
sat
down
to
write
this
history
,
to
*NL*
flatter
no
man
,
but
to
guide
our
pen
throughout
by
the
directions
of
*NL*
truth
,
we
are
obliged
to
bring
our
heroe
on
the
stage
in
a
much
more
*NL*
disadvantageous
manner
than
we
could
wish
;
and
to
declare
honestly
,
*NL*
even
at
his
first
appearance
,
that
it
was
the
universal
opinion
of
all
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
's
family
that
he
was
certainly
born
to
be
hanged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
there
was
too
much
reason
for
this
*NL*
conjecture
;
the
lad
having
from
his
earliest
years
discovered
a
*NL*
propensity
to
many
vices
,
and
especially
to
one
which
hath
as
direct
a
*NL*
tendency
as
any
other
to
that
fate
which
we
have
just
now
observed
to
*NL*
have
been
prophetically
denounced
against
him
:
he
had
been
already
*NL*
convicted
of
three
robberies
,
viz.
,
of
robbing
an
orchard
,
of
stealing
*NL*
a
duck
out
of
a
farmer
's
yard
,
and
of
picking
Master
Blifil
's
pocket
*NL*
of
a
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vices
of
this
young
man
were
,
moreover
,
heightened
by
the
*NL*
disadvantageous
light
in
which
they
appeared
when
opposed
to
the
*NL*
virtues
of
Master
Blifil
,
his
companion
;
a
youth
of
so
different
a
*NL*
cast
from
little
Jones
,
that
not
only
the
family
but
all
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
resounded
his
praises
.
He
was
,
indeed
,
a
lad
of
a
*NL*
remarkable
disposition
;
sober
,
discreet
,
and
pious
beyond
his
age
;
*NL*
qualities
which
gained
him
the
love
of
every
one
who
knew
him
:
while
*NL*
Tom
Jones
was
universally
disliked
;
and
many
expressed
their
wonder
*NL*
that
Mr
Allworthy
would
suffer
such
a
lad
to
be
educated
with
his
*NL*
nephew
,
lest
the
morals
of
the
latter
should
be
corrupted
by
his
*NL*
example
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
incident
which
happened
about
this
time
will
set
the
characters
of
*NL*
these
two
lads
more
fairly
before
the
discerning
reader
than
is
in
the
*NL*
power
of
the
longest
dissertation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Jones
,
who
,
bad
as
he
is
,
must
serve
for
the
heroe
of
this
*NL*
history
,
had
only
one
friend
among
all
the
servants
of
the
family
;
for
*NL*
as
to
Mrs
Wilkins
,
she
had
long
since
given
him
up
,
and
was
perfectly
*NL*
reconciled
to
her
mistress
.
This
friend
was
the
gamekeeper
,
a
fellow
*NL*
of
a
loose
kind
of
disposition
,
and
who
was
thought
not
to
entertain
*NL*
much
stricter
notions
concerning
the
difference
of
_
meum
_
and
_
tuum
_
*NL*
than
the
young
gentleman
himself
.
And
hence
this
friendship
gave
*NL*
occasion
to
many
sarcastical
remarks
among
the
domestics
,
most
of
*NL*
which
were
either
proverbs
before
,
or
at
least
are
become
so
now
;
and
,
*NL*
indeed
,
the
wit
of
them
all
may
be
comprised
in
that
short
Latin
*NL*
proverb
,
''
_
Noscitur
a
socio
;
_
''
which
,
I
think
,
is
thus
expressed
in
*NL*
English
,
``
You
may
know
him
by
the
company
he
keeps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
some
of
that
atrocious
wickedness
in
Jones
,
of
which
*NL*
we
have
just
mentioned
three
examples
,
might
perhaps
be
derived
from
*NL*
the
encouragement
he
had
received
from
this
fellow
,
who
,
in
two
or
*NL*
three
instances
,
had
been
what
the
law
calls
an
accessary
after
the
*NL*
fact
:
for
the
whole
duck
,
and
great
part
of
the
apples
,
were
converted
*NL*
to
the
use
of
the
gamekeeper
and
his
family
;
though
,
as
Jones
alone
*NL*
was
discovered
,
the
poor
lad
bore
not
only
the
whole
smart
,
but
the
*NL*
whole
blame
;
both
which
fell
again
to
his
lot
on
the
following
*NL*
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Contiguous
to
Mr
Allworthy
's
estate
was
the
manor
of
one
of
those
*NL*
gentlemen
who
are
called
preservers
of
the
game
.
This
species
of
men
,
*NL*
from
the
great
severity
with
which
they
revenge
the
death
of
a
hare
or
*NL*
partridge
,
might
be
thought
to
cultivate
the
same
superstition
with
*NL*
the
Bannians
in
India
;
many
of
whom
,
we
are
told
,
dedicate
their
whole
*NL*
lives
to
the
preservation
and
protection
of
certain
animals
;
was
it
*NL*
not
that
our
English
Bannians
,
while
they
preserve
them
from
other
*NL*
enemies
,
will
most
unmercifully
slaughter
whole
horse-loads
*NL*
themselves
;
so
that
they
stand
clearly
acquitted
of
any
such
*NL*
heathenish
superstition
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
,
indeed
,
a
much
better
opinion
of
this
kind
of
men
than
is
*NL*
entertained
by
some
,
as
I
take
them
to
answer
the
order
of
Nature
,
and
*NL*
the
good
purposes
for
which
they
were
ordained
,
in
a
more
ample
manner
*NL*
than
many
others
.
Now
,
as
Horace
tells
us
that
there
are
a
set
of
*NL*
human
beings
*NL*
*NL*
_
Fruges
consumere
nati
,
_
*NL*
*NL*
``
Born
to
consume
the
fruits
of
the
earth
;
''
so
I
make
no
manner
of
*NL*
doubt
but
that
there
are
others
*NL*
*NL*
_
Feras
consumere
nati
,
_
*NL*
*NL*
``
Born
to
consume
the
beasts
of
the
field
;
''
or
,
as
it
is
commonly
*NL*
called
,
the
game
;
and
none
,
I
believe
,
will
deny
but
that
those
*NL*
squires
fulfil
this
end
of
their
creation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Jones
went
one
day
a
shooting
with
the
gamekeeper
;
when
*NL*
happening
to
spring
a
covey
of
partridges
near
the
border
of
that
*NL*
manor
over
which
Fortune
,
to
fulfil
the
wise
purposes
of
Nature
,
had
*NL*
planted
one
of
the
game
consumers
,
the
birds
flew
into
it
,
and
were
*NL*
marked
-LRB-
as
it
is
called
-RRB-
by
the
two
sportsmen
,
in
some
furze
bushes
,
*NL*
about
two
or
three
hundred
paces
beyond
Mr
Allworthy
's
dominions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
had
given
the
fellow
strict
orders
,
on
pain
of
forfeiting
*NL*
his
place
,
never
to
trespass
on
any
of
his
neighbours
;
no
more
on
*NL*
those
who
were
less
rigid
in
this
matter
than
on
the
lord
of
this
*NL*
manor
.
With
regard
to
others
,
indeed
,
these
orders
had
not
been
always
*NL*
very
scrupulously
kept
;
but
as
the
disposition
of
the
gentleman
with
*NL*
whom
the
partridges
had
taken
sanctuary
was
well
known
,
the
gamekeeper
*NL*
had
never
yet
attempted
to
invade
his
territories
.
Nor
had
he
done
it
*NL*
now
,
had
not
the
younger
sportsman
,
who
was
excessively
eager
to
*NL*
pursue
the
flying
game
,
over-persuaded
him
;
but
Jones
being
very
*NL*
importunate
,
the
other
,
who
was
himself
keen
enough
after
the
sport
,
*NL*
yielded
to
his
persuasions
,
entered
the
manor
,
and
shot
one
of
the
*NL*
partridges
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
himself
was
at
that
time
on
horse-back
,
at
a
little
*NL*
distance
from
them
;
and
hearing
the
gun
go
off
,
he
immediately
made
*NL*
towards
the
place
,
and
discovered
poor
Tom
;
for
the
gamekeeper
had
*NL*
leapt
into
the
thickest
part
of
the
furze-brake
,
where
he
had
happily
*NL*
concealed
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
having
searched
the
lad
,
and
found
the
partridge
upon
*NL*
him
,
denounced
great
vengeance
,
swearing
he
would
acquaint
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
.
He
was
as
good
as
his
word
:
for
he
rode
immediately
to
his
*NL*
house
,
and
complained
of
the
trespass
on
his
manor
in
as
high
terms
*NL*
and
as
bitter
language
as
if
his
house
had
been
broken
open
,
and
the
*NL*
most
valuable
furniture
stole
out
of
it
.
He
added
,
that
some
other
*NL*
person
was
in
his
company
,
though
he
could
not
discover
him
;
for
that
*NL*
two
guns
had
been
discharged
almost
in
the
same
instant
.
And
,
says
he
,
*NL*
``
We
have
found
only
this
partridge
,
but
the
Lord
knows
what
mischief
*NL*
they
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
return
home
,
Tom
was
presently
convened
before
Mr
Allworthy
.
He
*NL*
owned
the
fact
,
and
alledged
no
other
excuse
but
what
was
really
true
,
*NL*
viz.
,
that
the
covey
was
originally
sprung
in
Mr
Allworthy
's
own
*NL*
manor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
then
interrogated
who
was
with
him
,
which
Mr
Allworthy
*NL*
declared
he
was
resolved
to
know
,
acquainting
the
culprit
with
the
*NL*
circumstance
of
the
two
guns
,
which
had
been
deposed
by
the
squire
and
*NL*
both
his
servants
;
but
Tom
stoutly
persisted
in
asserting
that
he
was
*NL*
alone
;
yet
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
hesitated
a
little
at
first
,
which
*NL*
would
have
confirmed
Mr
Allworthy
's
belief
,
had
what
the
squire
and
*NL*
his
servants
said
wanted
any
further
confirmation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamekeeper
,
being
a
suspected
person
,
was
now
sent
for
,
and
the
*NL*
question
put
to
him
;
but
he
,
relying
on
the
promise
which
Tom
had
made
*NL*
him
,
to
take
all
upon
himself
,
very
resolutely
denied
being
in
company
*NL*
with
the
young
gentleman
,
or
indeed
having
seen
him
the
whole
*NL*
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
then
turned
towards
Tom
,
with
more
than
usual
anger
in
*NL*
his
countenance
,
and
advised
him
to
confess
who
was
with
him
;
*NL*
repeating
,
that
he
was
resolved
to
know
.
The
lad
,
however
,
still
*NL*
maintained
his
resolution
,
and
was
dismissed
with
much
wrath
by
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
who
told
him
he
should
have
to
the
next
morning
to
consider
*NL*
of
it
,
when
he
should
be
questioned
by
another
person
,
and
in
another
*NL*
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jones
spent
a
very
melancholy
night
;
and
the
more
so
,
as
he
was
*NL*
without
his
usual
companion
;
for
Master
Blifil
was
gone
abroad
on
a
*NL*
visit
with
his
mother
.
Fear
of
the
punishment
he
was
to
suffer
was
on
*NL*
this
occasion
his
least
evil
;
his
chief
anxiety
being
,
lest
his
*NL*
constancy
should
fail
him
,
and
he
should
be
brought
to
betray
the
*NL*
gamekeeper
,
whose
ruin
he
knew
must
now
be
the
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
did
the
gamekeeper
pass
his
time
much
better
.
He
had
the
same
*NL*
apprehensions
with
the
youth
;
for
whose
honour
he
had
likewise
a
much
*NL*
tenderer
regard
than
for
his
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
,
when
Tom
attended
the
reverend
Mr
Thwackum
,
the
person
*NL*
to
whom
Mr
Allworthy
had
committed
the
instruction
of
the
two
boys
,
he
*NL*
had
the
same
questions
put
to
him
by
that
gentleman
which
he
had
been
*NL*
asked
the
evening
before
,
to
which
he
returned
the
same
answers
.
The
*NL*
consequence
of
this
was
,
so
severe
a
whipping
,
that
it
possibly
fell
*NL*
little
short
of
the
torture
with
which
confessions
are
in
some
*NL*
countries
extorted
from
criminals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
bore
his
punishment
with
great
resolution
;
and
though
his
master
*NL*
asked
him
,
between
every
stroke
,
whether
he
would
not
confess
,
he
was
*NL*
contented
to
be
flead
rather
than
betray
his
friend
,
or
break
the
*NL*
promise
he
had
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamekeeper
was
now
relieved
from
his
anxiety
,
and
Mr
Allworthy
*NL*
himself
began
to
be
concerned
at
Tom
's
sufferings
:
for
besides
that
Mr
*NL*
Thwackum
,
being
highly
enraged
that
he
was
not
able
to
make
the
boy
*NL*
say
what
he
himself
pleased
,
had
carried
his
severity
much
beyond
the
*NL*
good
man
's
intention
,
this
latter
began
now
to
suspect
that
the
squire
*NL*
had
been
mistaken
;
which
his
extreme
eagerness
and
anger
seemed
to
*NL*
make
probable
;
and
as
for
what
the
servants
had
said
in
confirmation
*NL*
of
their
master
's
account
,
he
laid
no
great
stress
upon
that
.
Now
,
as
*NL*
cruelty
and
injustice
were
two
ideas
of
which
Mr
Allworthy
could
by
no
*NL*
means
support
the
consciousness
a
single
moment
,
he
sent
for
Tom
,
and
*NL*
after
many
kind
and
friendly
exhortations
,
said
,
``
I
am
convinced
,
my
*NL*
dear
child
,
that
my
suspicions
have
wronged
you
;
I
am
sorry
that
you
*NL*
have
been
so
severely
punished
on
this
account
.
''
And
at
last
gave
him
*NL*
a
little
horse
to
make
him
amends
;
again
repeating
his
sorrow
for
what
*NL*
had
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
guilt
now
flew
in
his
face
more
than
any
severity
could
make
it
.
*NL*
He
could
more
easily
bear
the
lashes
of
Thwackum
,
than
the
generosity
*NL*
of
Allworthy
.
The
tears
burst
from
his
eyes
,
and
he
fell
upon
his
*NL*
knees
,
crying
,
``
Oh
,
sir
,
you
are
too
good
to
me
.
Indeed
you
are
.
*NL*
Indeed
I
do
n't
deserve
it
.
''
And
at
that
very
instant
,
from
the
fulness
*NL*
of
his
heart
,
had
almost
betrayed
the
secret
;
but
the
good
genius
of
*NL*
the
gamekeeper
suggested
to
him
what
might
be
the
consequence
to
the
*NL*
poor
fellow
,
and
this
consideration
sealed
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
did
all
he
could
to
persuade
Allworthy
from
showing
any
*NL*
compassion
or
kindness
to
the
boy
,
saying
,
``
He
had
persisted
in
an
*NL*
untruth
;
''
and
gave
some
hints
,
that
a
second
whipping
might
probably
*NL*
bring
the
matter
to
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr
Allworthy
absolutely
refused
to
consent
to
the
experiment
.
He
*NL*
said
,
the
boy
had
suffered
enough
already
for
concealing
the
truth
,
*NL*
even
if
he
was
guilty
,
seeing
that
he
could
have
no
motive
but
a
*NL*
mistaken
point
of
honour
for
so
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Honour
!
''
cryed
Thwackum
,
with
some
warmth
,
``
mere
stubbornness
and
*NL*
obstinacy
!
Can
honour
teach
any
one
to
tell
a
lie
,
or
can
any
honour
*NL*
exist
independent
of
religion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
discourse
happened
at
table
when
dinner
was
just
ended
;
and
there
*NL*
were
present
Mr
Allworthy
,
Mr
Thwackum
,
and
a
third
gentleman
,
who
now
*NL*
entered
into
the
debate
,
and
whom
,
before
we
proceed
any
further
,
we
*NL*
shall
briefly
introduce
to
our
reader
's
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
character
of
Mr
Square
the
philosopher
,
and
of
Mr
Thwackum
the
*NL*
divine
;
with
a
dispute
concerning
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
this
gentleman
,
who
had
then
resided
some
time
at
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
's
house
,
was
Mr
Square
.
His
natural
parts
were
not
of
the
*NL*
first
rate
,
but
he
had
greatly
improved
them
by
a
learned
education
.
*NL*
He
was
deeply
read
in
the
antients
,
and
a
profest
master
of
all
the
*NL*
works
of
Plato
and
Aristotle
.
Upon
which
great
models
he
had
*NL*
principally
formed
himself
;
sometimes
according
with
the
opinion
of
*NL*
the
one
,
and
sometimes
with
that
of
the
other
.
In
morals
he
was
a
*NL*
profest
Platonist
,
and
in
religion
he
inclined
to
be
an
Aristotelian
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
he
had
,
as
we
have
said
,
formed
his
morals
on
the
Platonic
*NL*
model
,
yet
he
perfectly
agreed
with
the
opinion
of
Aristotle
,
in
*NL*
considering
that
great
man
rather
in
the
quality
of
a
philosopher
or
a
*NL*
speculatist
,
than
as
a
legislator
.
This
sentiment
he
carried
a
great
*NL*
way
;
indeed
,
so
far
,
as
to
regard
all
virtue
as
matter
of
theory
only
.
*NL*
This
,
it
is
true
,
he
never
affirmed
,
as
I
have
heard
,
to
any
one
;
and
*NL*
yet
upon
the
least
attention
to
his
conduct
,
I
can
not
help
thinking
it
*NL*
was
his
real
opinion
,
as
it
will
perfectly
reconcile
some
*NL*
contradictions
which
might
otherwise
appear
in
his
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gentleman
and
Mr
Thwackum
scarce
ever
met
without
a
disputation
;
*NL*
for
their
tenets
were
indeed
diametrically
opposite
to
each
other
.
*NL*
Square
held
human
nature
to
be
the
perfection
of
all
virtue
,
and
that
*NL*
vice
was
a
deviation
from
our
nature
,
in
the
same
manner
as
deformity
*NL*
of
body
is
.
Thwackum
,
on
the
contrary
,
maintained
that
the
human
mind
,
*NL*
since
the
fall
,
was
nothing
but
a
sink
of
iniquity
,
till
purified
and
*NL*
redeemed
by
grace
.
In
one
point
only
they
agreed
,
which
was
,
in
all
*NL*
their
discourses
on
morality
never
to
mention
the
word
goodness
.
The
*NL*
favourite
phrase
of
the
former
,
was
the
natural
beauty
of
virtue
;
that
*NL*
of
the
latter
,
was
the
divine
power
of
grace
.
The
former
measured
all
*NL*
actions
by
the
unalterable
rule
of
right
,
and
the
eternal
fitness
of
*NL*
things
;
the
latter
decided
all
matters
by
authority
;
but
in
doing
*NL*
this
,
he
always
used
the
scriptures
and
their
commentators
,
as
the
*NL*
lawyer
doth
his
Coke
upon
Lyttleton
,
where
the
comment
is
of
equal
*NL*
authority
with
the
text
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
short
introduction
,
the
reader
will
be
pleased
to
remember
,
*NL*
that
the
parson
had
concluded
his
speech
with
a
triumphant
question
,
*NL*
to
which
he
had
apprehended
no
answer
;
viz.
,
Can
any
honour
exist
*NL*
independent
on
religion
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
Square
answered
;
that
it
was
impossible
to
discourse
*NL*
philosophically
concerning
words
,
till
their
meaning
was
first
*NL*
established
:
that
there
were
scarce
any
two
words
of
a
more
vague
and
*NL*
uncertain
signification
,
than
the
two
he
had
mentioned
;
for
that
there
*NL*
were
almost
as
many
different
opinions
concerning
honour
,
as
*NL*
concerning
religion
.
``
But
,
''
says
he
,
``
if
by
honour
you
mean
the
true
*NL*
natural
beauty
of
virtue
,
I
will
maintain
it
may
exist
independent
of
*NL*
any
religion
whatever
.
Nay
,
''
added
he
,
``
you
yourself
will
allow
it
may
*NL*
exist
independent
of
all
but
one
:
so
will
a
Mahometan
,
a
Jew
,
and
all
*NL*
the
maintainers
of
all
the
different
sects
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
replied
,
this
was
arguing
with
the
usual
malice
of
all
the
*NL*
enemies
to
the
true
Church
.
He
said
,
he
doubted
not
but
that
all
the
*NL*
infidels
and
hereticks
in
the
world
would
,
if
they
could
,
confine
*NL*
honour
to
their
own
absurd
errors
and
damnable
deceptions
;
``
but
*NL*
honour
,
''
says
he
,
``
is
not
therefore
manifold
,
because
there
are
many
*NL*
absurd
opinions
about
it
;
nor
is
religion
manifold
,
because
there
are
*NL*
various
sects
and
heresies
in
the
world
.
When
I
mention
religion
,
I
*NL*
mean
the
Christian
religion
;
and
not
only
the
Christian
religion
,
but
*NL*
the
Protestant
religion
;
and
not
only
the
Protestant
religion
,
but
the
*NL*
Church
of
England
.
And
when
I
mention
honour
,
I
mean
that
mode
of
*NL*
Divine
grace
which
is
not
only
consistent
with
,
but
dependent
upon
,
*NL*
this
religion
;
and
is
consistent
with
and
dependent
upon
no
other
.
Now
*NL*
to
say
that
the
honour
I
here
mean
,
and
which
was
,
I
thought
,
all
the
*NL*
honour
I
could
be
supposed
to
mean
,
will
uphold
,
much
less
dictate
an
*NL*
untruth
,
is
to
assert
an
absurdity
too
shocking
to
be
conceived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
purposely
avoided
,
''
says
Square
,
``
drawing
a
conclusion
which
I
*NL*
thought
evident
from
what
I
have
said
;
but
if
you
perceived
it
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
you
have
not
attempted
to
answer
it
.
However
,
to
drop
the
article
*NL*
of
religion
,
I
think
it
is
plain
,
from
what
you
have
said
,
that
we
*NL*
have
different
ideas
of
honour
;
or
why
do
we
not
agree
in
the
same
*NL*
terms
of
its
explanation
?
I
have
asserted
,
that
true
honour
and
true
*NL*
virtue
are
almost
synonymous
terms
,
and
they
are
both
founded
on
the
*NL*
unalterable
rule
of
right
,
and
the
eternal
fitness
of
things
;
to
which
*NL*
an
untruth
being
absolutely
repugnant
and
contrary
,
it
is
certain
that
*NL*
true
honour
can
not
support
an
untruth
.
In
this
,
therefore
,
I
think
we
*NL*
are
agreed
;
but
that
this
honour
can
be
said
to
be
founded
on
*NL*
religion
,
to
which
it
is
antecedent
,
if
by
religion
be
meant
any
*NL*
positive
law
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
,
''
answered
Thwackum
,
with
great
warmth
,
``
with
a
man
who
*NL*
asserts
honour
to
be
antecedent
to
religion
!
Mr
Allworthy
,
did
I
*NL*
agree
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
proceeding
when
Mr
Allworthy
interposed
,
telling
them
very
*NL*
coldly
,
they
had
both
mistaken
his
meaning
;
for
that
he
had
said
*NL*
nothing
of
true
honour
.
--
It
is
possible
,
however
,
he
would
not
have
*NL*
easily
quieted
the
disputants
,
who
were
growing
equally
warm
,
had
not
*NL*
another
matter
now
fallen
out
,
which
put
a
final
end
to
the
*NL*
conversation
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
a
necessary
apology
for
the
author
;
and
a
childish
*NL*
incident
,
which
perhaps
requires
an
apology
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
proceed
farther
,
I
shall
beg
leave
to
obviate
some
*NL*
misconstructions
into
which
the
zeal
of
some
few
readers
may
lead
*NL*
them
;
for
I
would
not
willingly
give
offence
to
any
,
especially
to
men
*NL*
who
are
warm
in
the
cause
of
virtue
or
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hope
,
therefore
,
no
man
will
,
by
the
grossest
misunderstanding
or
*NL*
perversion
of
my
meaning
,
misrepresent
me
,
as
endeavouring
to
cast
any
*NL*
ridicule
on
the
greatest
perfections
of
human
nature
;
and
which
do
,
*NL*
indeed
,
alone
purify
and
ennoble
the
heart
of
man
,
and
raise
him
above
*NL*
the
brute
creation
.
This
,
reader
,
I
will
venture
to
say
-LRB-
and
by
how
*NL*
much
the
better
man
you
are
yourself
,
by
so
much
the
more
will
you
be
*NL*
inclined
to
believe
me
-RRB-
,
that
I
would
rather
have
buried
the
*NL*
sentiments
of
these
two
persons
in
eternal
oblivion
,
than
have
done
*NL*
any
injury
to
either
of
these
glorious
causes
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
it
is
with
a
view
to
their
service
,
that
I
have
taken
*NL*
upon
me
to
record
the
lives
and
actions
of
two
of
their
false
and
*NL*
pretended
champions
.
A
treacherous
friend
is
the
most
dangerous
enemy
;
*NL*
and
I
will
say
boldly
,
that
both
religion
and
virtue
have
received
*NL*
more
real
discredit
from
hypocrites
than
the
wittiest
profligates
or
*NL*
infidels
could
ever
cast
upon
them
:
nay
,
farther
,
as
these
two
,
in
*NL*
their
purity
,
are
rightly
called
the
bands
of
civil
society
,
and
are
*NL*
indeed
the
greatest
of
blessings
;
so
when
poisoned
and
corrupted
with
*NL*
fraud
,
pretence
,
and
affectation
,
they
have
become
the
worst
of
civil
*NL*
curses
,
and
have
enabled
men
to
perpetrate
the
most
cruel
mischiefs
to
*NL*
their
own
species
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
doubt
not
but
this
ridicule
will
in
general
be
allowed
:
my
*NL*
chief
apprehension
is
,
as
many
true
and
just
sentiments
often
came
*NL*
from
the
mouths
of
these
persons
,
lest
the
whole
should
be
taken
*NL*
together
,
and
I
should
be
conceived
to
ridicule
all
alike
.
Now
the
*NL*
reader
will
be
pleased
to
consider
,
that
,
as
neither
of
these
men
were
*NL*
fools
,
they
could
not
be
supposed
to
have
holden
none
but
wrong
*NL*
principles
,
and
to
have
uttered
nothing
but
absurdities
;
what
*NL*
injustice
,
therefore
,
must
I
have
done
to
their
characters
,
had
I
*NL*
selected
only
what
was
bad
!
And
how
horribly
wretched
and
maimed
must
*NL*
their
arguments
have
appeared
!
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
whole
,
it
is
not
religion
or
virtue
,
but
the
want
of
them
,
*NL*
which
is
here
exposed
.
Had
not
Thwackum
too
much
neglected
virtue
,
and
*NL*
Square
,
religion
,
in
the
composition
of
their
several
systems
,
and
had
*NL*
not
both
utterly
discarded
all
natural
goodness
of
heart
,
they
had
*NL*
never
been
represented
as
the
objects
of
derision
in
this
history
;
in
*NL*
which
we
will
now
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
matter
then
,
which
put
an
end
to
the
debate
mentioned
in
the
last
*NL*
chapter
,
was
no
other
than
a
quarrel
between
Master
Blifil
and
Tom
*NL*
Jones
,
the
consequence
of
which
had
been
a
bloody
nose
to
the
former
;
*NL*
for
though
Master
Blifil
,
notwithstanding
he
was
the
younger
,
was
in
*NL*
size
above
the
other
's
match
,
yet
Tom
was
much
his
superior
at
the
*NL*
noble
art
of
boxing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
however
,
cautiously
avoided
all
engagements
with
that
youth
;
for
*NL*
besides
that
Tommy
Jones
was
an
inoffensive
lad
amidst
all
his
*NL*
roguery
,
and
really
loved
Blifil
,
Mr
Thwackum
being
always
the
second
*NL*
of
the
latter
,
would
have
been
sufficient
to
deter
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
well
says
a
certain
author
,
No
man
is
wise
at
all
hours
;
it
is
*NL*
therefore
no
wonder
that
a
boy
is
not
so
.
A
difference
arising
at
play
*NL*
between
the
two
lads
,
Master
Blifil
called
Tom
a
beggarly
bastard
.
*NL*
Upon
which
the
latter
,
who
was
somewhat
passionate
in
his
disposition
,
*NL*
immediately
caused
that
phenomenon
in
the
face
of
the
former
,
which
we
*NL*
have
above
remembered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Blifil
now
,
with
his
blood
running
from
his
nose
,
and
the
tears
*NL*
galloping
after
from
his
eyes
,
appeared
before
his
uncle
and
the
*NL*
tremendous
Thwackum
.
In
which
court
an
indictment
of
assault
,
battery
,
*NL*
and
wounding
,
was
instantly
preferred
against
Tom
;
who
in
his
excuse
*NL*
only
pleaded
the
provocation
,
which
was
indeed
all
the
matter
that
*NL*
Master
Blifil
had
omitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
indeed
possible
that
this
circumstance
might
have
escaped
his
*NL*
memory
;
for
,
in
his
reply
,
he
positively
insisted
,
that
he
had
made
*NL*
use
of
no
such
appellation
;
adding
,
``
Heaven
forbid
such
naughty
words
*NL*
should
ever
come
out
of
his
mouth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
though
against
all
form
of
law
,
rejoined
in
affirmance
of
the
*NL*
words
.
Upon
which
Master
Blifil
said
,
``
It
is
no
wonder
.
Those
who
will
*NL*
tell
one
fib
,
will
hardly
stick
at
another
.
If
I
had
told
my
master
*NL*
such
a
wicked
fib
as
you
have
done
,
I
should
be
ashamed
to
show
my
*NL*
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
fib
,
child
?
''
cries
Thwackum
pretty
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
told
you
that
nobody
was
with
him
a
shooting
when
he
killed
*NL*
the
partridge
;
but
he
knows
''
-LRB-
here
he
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
yes
,
he
knows
,
for
he
confessed
it
to
me
,
that
Black
George
the
*NL*
gamekeeper
was
there
.
Nay
,
he
said
--
yes
you
did
--
deny
it
if
you
can
,
*NL*
that
you
would
not
have
confest
the
truth
,
though
master
had
cut
you
*NL*
to
pieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
the
fire
flashed
from
Thwackum
's
eyes
,
and
he
cried
out
in
*NL*
triumph
--
``
Oh
!
ho
!
this
is
your
mistaken
notion
of
honour
!
This
is
the
*NL*
boy
who
was
not
to
be
whipped
again
!
''
But
Mr
Allworthy
,
with
a
more
*NL*
gentle
aspect
,
turned
towards
the
lad
,
and
said
,
``
Is
this
true
,
child
?
*NL*
How
came
you
to
persist
so
obstinately
in
a
falsehood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
said
,
``
He
scorned
a
lie
as
much
as
any
one
:
but
he
thought
his
*NL*
honour
engaged
him
to
act
as
he
did
;
for
he
had
promised
the
poor
*NL*
fellow
to
conceal
him
:
which
,
''
he
said
,
``
he
thought
himself
farther
*NL*
obliged
to
,
as
the
gamekeeper
had
begged
him
not
to
go
into
the
*NL*
gentleman
's
manor
,
and
had
at
last
gone
himself
,
in
compliance
with
*NL*
his
persuasions
.

He
said
,
``
This
was
the
whole
truth
of
the
matter
,
*NL*
and
he
would
take
his
oath
of
it
;
''
and
concluded
with
very
*NL*
passionately
begging
Mr
Allworthy
``
to
have
compassion
on
the
poor
*NL*
fellow
's
family
,
especially
as
he
himself
only
had
been
guilty

and
*NL*
the
other
had
been
very
difficultly
prevailed
on
to
do
what
he
did
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
sir
,

said
he
,
``
it
could
hardly
be
called
a
lie
that
I
told
;
*NL*
for
the
poor
fellow
was
entirely
innocent
of
the
whole
matter
.
I
*NL*
should
have
gone
alone
after
the
birds
;
nay
,
I
did
go
at
first
,
and
he
*NL*
only
followed
me
to
prevent
more
mischief
.
Do
,
pray

sir
,
let
me
be
*NL*
punished
;
take
my
little
horse
away
again
;
but
pray

sir
,
forgive
poor
*NL*
George

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
hesitated
a
few
moments
,
and
then
dismissed
the
boys
,
*NL*
advising
them
to
live
more
friendly
and
peaceably
together

The
opinions
of
the
divine
and
the
philosopher
concerning
the
two
*NL*
boys
;
with
some
reasons
for
their
opinions
,
and
other
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
probable
,
that
by
disclosing
this
secret
,
which
had
been
*NL*
communicated
in
the
utmost
confidence
to
him
,
young
Blifil
preserved

his

from

good
lashing

the
offence

the
bloody
nose

have

sufficient

proceeded
to
correction
;
but
now
this
was
totally
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
consideration
of
the
other
matter
;
and
with
regard
to
this
,
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
declared
privately
,
he
thought
the
boy
deserved
reward
*NL*
rather
than
punishment
,
so
that
Thwackum
's
hand
was
withheld
by
a
*NL*
general
pardon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
,
whose
meditations
were
full
of
birch
,
exclaimed
against
this
*NL*
weak
,
and
,
as
he
said
he
would
venture
to
call
it
,
wicked
lenity
.
To
*NL*
remit
the
punishment
of
such
crimes
was
,
he
said
,
to
encourage
them
.
*NL*
He
enlarged
much
on
the
correction
of
children
,
and
quoted
many
texts
*NL*
from
Solomon
,
and
others
;
which
being
to
be
found
in
so
many
other
*NL*
books
,
shall
not
be
found
here
.
He
then
applied
himself
to
the
vice
of
*NL*
lying
,
on
which
head
he
was
altogether
as
learned
as
he
had
been
on
*NL*
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Square
said
,
he
had
been
endeavouring
to
reconcile
the
behaviour
of
*NL*
Tom
with
his
idea
of
perfect
virtue
,
but
could
not
.
He
owned
there
was
*NL*
something
which
at
first
sight
appeared
like
fortitude
in
the
action
;
*NL*
but
as
fortitude
was
a
virtue
,
and
falsehood
a
vice
,
they
could
by
no
*NL*
means
agree
or
unite
together
.
He
added
,
that
as
this
was
in
some
*NL*
measure
to
confound
virtue
and
vice
,
it
might
be
worth
Mr
Thwackum
's
*NL*
consideration
,
whether
a
larger
castigation
might
not
be
laid
on
upon
*NL*
the
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
both
these
learned
men
concurred
in
censuring
Jones
,
so
were
they
*NL*
no
less
unanimous
in
applauding
Master
Blifil
.
To
bring
truth
to
*NL*
light
,
was
by
the
parson
asserted
to
be
the
duty
of
every
religious
*NL*
man
;
and
by
the
philosopher
this
was
declared
to
be
highly
conformable
*NL*
with
the
rule
of
right
,
and
the
eternal
and
unalterable
fitness
of
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
,
however
,
weighed
very
little
with
Mr
Allworthy
.
He
could
not
*NL*
be
prevailed
on
to
sign
the
warrant
for
the
execution
of
Jones
.
There
*NL*
was
something
within
his
own
breast
with
which
the
invincible
fidelity
*NL*
which
that
youth
had
preserved
,
corresponded
much
better
than
it
had
*NL*
done
with
the
religion
of
Thwackum
,
or
with
the
virtue
of
Square
.
He
*NL*
therefore
strictly
ordered
the
former
of
these
gentlemen
to
abstain
*NL*
from
laying
violent
hands
on
Tom
for
what
had
past
.
The
pedagogue
was
*NL*
obliged
to
obey
those
orders
;
but
not
without
great
reluctance
,
and
*NL*
frequent
mutterings
that
the
boy
would
be
certainly
spoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
gamekeeper
the
good
man
behaved
with
more
severity
.
He
*NL*
presently
summoned
that
poor
fellow
before
him
,
and
after
many
bitter
*NL*
remonstrances
,
paid
him
his
wages
,
and
dismist
him
from
his
service
;
*NL*
for
Mr
Allworthy
rightly
observed
,
that
there
was
a
great
difference
*NL*
between
being
guilty
of
a
falsehood
to
excuse
yourself
,
and
to
excuse
*NL*
another
.
He
likewise
urged
,
as
the
principal
motive
to
his
inflexible
*NL*
severity
against
this
man
,
that
he
had
basely
suffered
Tom
Jones
to
*NL*
undergo
so
heavy
a
punishment
for
his
sake
,
whereas
he
ought
to
have
*NL*
prevented
it
by
making
the
discovery
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
story
became
public
,
many
people
differed
from
Square
and
*NL*
Thwackum
,
in
judging
the
conduct
of
the
two
lads
on
the
occasion
.
*NL*
Master
Blifil
was
generally
called
a
sneaking
rascal
,
a
poor-spirited
*NL*
wretch
,
with
other
epithets
of
the
like
kind
;
whilst
Tom
was
honoured
*NL*
with
the
appellations
of
a
brave
lad
,
a
jolly
dog
,
and
an
honest
*NL*
fellow
.
Indeed
,
his
behaviour
to
Black
George
much
ingratiated
him
*NL*
with
all
the
servants
;
for
though
that
fellow
was
before
universally
*NL*
disliked
,
yet
he
was
no
sooner
turned
away
than
he
was
as
universally
*NL*
pitied
;
and
the
friendship
and
gallantry
of
Tom
Jones
was
celebrated
*NL*
by
them
all
with
the
highest
applause
;
and
they
condemned
Master
*NL*
Blifil
as
openly
as
they
durst
,
without
incurring
the
danger
of
*NL*
offending
his
mother
.
For
all
this
,
however
,
poor
Tom
smarted
in
the
*NL*
flesh
;
for
though
Thwackum
had
been
inhibited
to
exercise
his
arm
on
*NL*
the
foregoing
account
,
yet
,
as
the
proverb
says
,
It
is
easy
to
find
a
*NL*
stick
,
&
c
.
So
was
it
easy
to
find
a
rod
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
not
being
*NL*
able
to
find
one
was
the
only
thing
which
could
have
kept
Thwackum
any
*NL*
long
time
from
chastising
poor
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
bare
delight
in
the
sport
been
the
only
inducement
to
the
*NL*
pedagogue
,
it
is
probable
Master
Blifil
would
likewise
have
had
his
*NL*
share
;
but
though
Mr
Allworthy
had
given
him
frequent
orders
to
make
*NL*
no
difference
between
the
lads
,
yet
was
Thwackum
altogether
as
kind
*NL*
and
gentle
to
this
youth
,
as
he
was
harsh
,
nay
even
barbarous
,
to
the
*NL*
other
.
To
say
the
truth
,
Blifil
had
greatly
gained
his
master
's
*NL*
affections
;
partly
by
the
profound
respect
he
always
showed
his
*NL*
person
,
but
much
more
by
the
decent
reverence
with
which
he
received
*NL*
his
doctrine
;
for
he
had
got
by
heart
,
and
frequently
repeated
,
his
*NL*
phrases
,
and
maintained
all
his
master
's
religious
principles
with
a
*NL*
zeal
which
was
surprizing
in
one
so
young
,
and
which
greatly
endeared
*NL*
him
to
the
worthy
preceptor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Jones
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
not
only
deficient
in
outward
tokens
*NL*
of
respect
,
often
forgetting
to
pull
off
his
hat
,
or
to
bow
at
his
*NL*
master
's
approach
;
but
was
altogether
as
unmindful
both
of
his
*NL*
master
's
precepts
and
example
.
He
was
indeed
a
thoughtless
,
giddy
*NL*
youth
,
with
little
sobriety
in
his
manners
,
and
less
in
his
*NL*
countenance
;
and
would
often
very
impudently
and
indecently
laugh
at
*NL*
his
companion
for
his
serious
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Square
had
the
same
reason
for
his
preference
of
the
former
lad
;
*NL*
for
Tom
Jones
showed
no
more
regard
to
the
learned
discourses
which
*NL*
this
gentleman
would
sometimes
throw
away
upon
him
,
than
to
those
of
*NL*
Thwackum
.
He
once
ventured
to
make
a
jest
of
the
rule
of
right
;
and
at
*NL*
another
time
said
,
he
believed
there
was
no
rule
in
the
world
capable
*NL*
of
making
such
a
man
as
his
father
-LRB-
for
so
Mr
Allworthy
suffered
*NL*
himself
to
be
called
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Blifil
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
address
enough
at
sixteen
to
*NL*
recommend
himself
at
one
and
the
same
time
to
both
these
opposites
.
*NL*
With
one
he
was
all
religion
,
with
the
other
he
was
all
virtue
.
And
*NL*
when
both
were
present
,
he
was
profoundly
silent
,
which
both
*NL*
interpreted
in
his
favour
and
in
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
Blifil
contented
with
flattering
both
these
gentlemen
to
their
*NL*
faces
;
he
took
frequent
occasions
of
praising
them
behind
their
backs
*NL*
to
Allworthy
;
before
whom
,
when
they
two
were
alone
,
and
his
uncle
*NL*
commended
any
religious
or
virtuous
sentiment
-LRB-
for
many
such
came
*NL*
constantly
from
him
-RRB-
he
seldom
failed
to
ascribe
it
to
the
good
*NL*
instructions
he
had
received
from
either
Thwackum
or
Square
;
for
he
*NL*
knew
his
uncle
repeated
all
such
compliments
to
the
persons
for
whose
*NL*
use
they
were
meant
;
and
he
found
by
experience
the
great
impressions
*NL*
which
they
made
on
the
philosopher
,
as
well
as
on
the
divine
:
for
,
to
*NL*
say
the
truth
,
there
is
no
kind
of
flattery
so
irresistible
as
this
,
*NL*
at
second
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
gentleman
,
moreover
,
soon
perceived
how
extremely
grateful
*NL*
all
those
panegyrics
on
his
instructors
were
to
Mr
Allworthy
himself
,
*NL*
as
they
so
loudly
resounded
the
praise
of
that
singular
plan
of
*NL*
education
which
he
had
laid
down
;
for
this
worthy
man
having
observed
*NL*
the
imperfect
institution
of
our
public
schools
,
and
the
many
vices
*NL*
which
boys
were
there
liable
to
learn
,
had
resolved
to
educate
his
*NL*
nephew
,
as
well
as
the
other
lad
,
whom
he
had
in
a
manner
adopted
,
in
*NL*
his
own
house
;
where
he
thought
their
morals
would
escape
all
that
*NL*
danger
of
being
corrupted
to
which
they
would
be
unavoidably
exposed
*NL*
in
any
public
school
or
university
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
,
therefore
,
determined
to
commit
these
boys
to
the
tuition
of
a
*NL*
private
tutor
,
Mr
Thwackum
was
recommended
to
him
for
that
office
,
by
*NL*
a
very
particular
friend
,
of
whose
understanding
Mr
Allworthy
had
a
*NL*
great
opinion
,
and
in
whose
integrity
he
placed
much
confidence
.
This
*NL*
Thwackum
was
fellow
of
a
college
,
where
he
almost
entirely
resided
;
*NL*
and
had
a
great
reputation
for
learning
,
religion
,
and
sobriety
of
*NL*
manners
.
And
these
were
doubtless
the
qualifications
by
which
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
's
friend
had
been
induced
to
recommend
him
;
though
indeed
*NL*
this
friend
had
some
obligations
to
Thwackum
's
family
,
who
were
the
*NL*
most
considerable
persons
in
a
borough
which
that
gentleman
*NL*
represented
in
parliament
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
,
at
his
first
arrival
,
was
extremely
agreeable
to
Allworthy
;
*NL*
and
indeed
he
perfectly
answered
the
character
which
had
been
given
of
*NL*
him
.
Upon
longer
acquaintance
,
however
,
and
more
intimate
*NL*
conversation
,
this
worthy
man
saw
infirmities
in
the
tutor
,
which
he
*NL*
could
have
wished
him
to
have
been
without
;
though
as
those
seemed
*NL*
greatly
overbalanced
by
his
good
qualities
,
they
did
not
incline
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
to
part
with
him
:
nor
would
they
indeed
have
justified
such
*NL*
a
proceeding
;
for
the
reader
is
greatly
mistaken
,
if
he
conceives
that
*NL*
Thwackum
appeared
to
Mr
Allworthy
in
the
same
light
as
he
doth
to
him
*NL*
in
this
history
;
and
he
is
as
much
deceived
,
if
he
imagines
that
the
*NL*
most
intimate
acquaintance
which
he
himself
could
have
had
with
that
*NL*
divine
,
would
have
informed
him
of
those
things
which
we
,
from
our
*NL*
inspiration
,
are
enabled
to
open
and
discover
.
Of
readers
who
,
from
*NL*
such
conceits
as
these
,
condemn
the
wisdom
or
penetration
of
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
I
shall
not
scruple
to
say
,
that
they
make
a
very
bad
and
*NL*
ungrateful
use
of
that
knowledge
which
we
have
communicated
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
apparent
errors
in
the
doctrine
of
Thwackum
served
greatly
to
*NL*
palliate
the
contrary
errors
in
that
of
Square
,
which
our
good
man
no
*NL*
less
saw
and
condemned
.
He
thought
,
indeed
,
that
the
different
*NL*
exuberancies
of
these
gentlemen
would
correct
their
different
*NL*
imperfections
;
and
that
from
both
,
especially
with
his
assistance
,
the
*NL*
two
lads
would
derive
sufficient
precepts
of
true
religion
and
virtue
.
*NL*
If
the
event
happened
contrary
to
his
expectations
,
this
possibly
*NL*
proceeded
from
some
fault
in
the
plan
itself
;
which
the
reader
hath
my
*NL*
leave
to
discover
,
if
he
can
:
for
we
do
not
pretend
to
introduce
any
*NL*
infallible
characters
into
this
history
;
where
we
hope
nothing
will
be
*NL*
found
which
hath
never
yet
been
seen
in
human
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
return
therefore
:
the
reader
will
not
,
I
think
,
wonder
that
the
*NL*
different
behaviour
of
the
two
lads
above
commemorated
,
produced
the
*NL*
different
effects
of
which
he
hath
already
seen
some
instance
;
and
*NL*
besides
this
,
there
was
another
reason
for
the
conduct
of
the
*NL*
philosopher
and
the
pedagogue
;
but
this
being
matter
of
great
*NL*
importance
,
we
shall
reveal
it
in
the
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
a
better
reason
still
for
the
before-mentioned
opinions
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
to
be
known
then
,
that
those
two
learned
personages
,
who
have
*NL*
lately
made
a
considerable
figure
on
the
theatre
of
this
history
,
had
,
*NL*
from
their
first
arrival
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
,
taken
so
great
an
*NL*
affection
,
the
one
to
his
virtue
,
the
other
to
his
religion
,
that
they
*NL*
had
meditated
the
closest
alliance
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
purpose
they
had
cast
their
eyes
on
that
fair
widow
,
whom
,
*NL*
though
we
have
not
for
some
time
made
any
mention
of
her
,
the
reader
,
*NL*
we
trust
,
hath
not
forgot
.
Mrs
Blifil
was
indeed
the
object
to
which
*NL*
they
both
aspired
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
seem
remarkable
,
that
,
of
four
persons
whom
we
have
*NL*
commemorated
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
house
,
three
of
them
should
fix
their
*NL*
inclinations
on
a
lady
who
was
never
greatly
celebrated
for
her
*NL*
beauty
,
and
who
was
,
moreover
,
now
a
little
descended
into
the
vale
of
*NL*
years
;
but
in
reality
bosom
friends
,
and
intimate
acquaintance
,
have
a
*NL*
kind
of
natural
propensity
to
particular
females
at
the
house
of
a
*NL*
friend
--
viz.
,
to
his
grandmother
,
mother
,
sister
,
daughter
,
aunt
,
*NL*
niece
,
or
cousin
,
when
they
are
rich
;
and
to
his
wife
,
sister
,
*NL*
daughter
,
niece
,
cousin
,
mistress
,
or
servant-maid
,
if
they
should
be
*NL*
handsome
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
would
not
,
however
,
have
our
reader
imagine
,
that
persons
of
such
*NL*
characters
as
were
supported
by
Thwackum
and
Square
,
would
undertake
a
*NL*
matter
of
this
kind
,
which
hath
been
a
little
censured
by
some
rigid
*NL*
moralists
,
before
they
had
thoroughly
examined
it
,
and
considered
*NL*
whether
it
was
-LRB-
as
Shakespear
phrases
it
-RRB-
``
Stuff
o
'
th
'
conscience
,
''
*NL*
or
no
.
Thwackum
was
encouraged
to
the
undertaking
by
reflecting
that
*NL*
to
covet
your
neighbour
's
sister
is
nowhere
forbidden
:
and
he
knew
it
*NL*
was
a
rule
in
the
construction
of
all
laws
,
that
''
_
Expressum
facit
*NL*
cessare
tacitum
.
_
''
The
sense
of
which
is
,
``
When
a
lawgiver
sets
down
*NL*
plainly
his
whole
meaning
,
we
are
prevented
from
making
him
mean
what
*NL*
we
please
ourselves
.
''
As
some
instances
of
women
,
therefore
,
are
*NL*
mentioned
in
the
divine
law
,
which
forbids
us
to
covet
our
neighbour
's
*NL*
goods
,
and
that
of
a
sister
omitted
,
he
concluded
it
to
be
lawful
.
And
*NL*
as
to
Square
,
who
was
in
his
person
what
is
called
a
jolly
fellow
,
or
*NL*
a
widow
's
man
,
he
easily
reconciled
his
choice
to
the
eternal
fitness
*NL*
of
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
both
of
these
gentlemen
were
industrious
in
taking
every
*NL*
opportunity
of
recommending
themselves
to
the
widow
,
they
apprehended
*NL*
one
certain
method
was
,
by
giving
her
son
the
constant
preference
to
*NL*
the
other
lad
;
and
as
they
conceived
the
kindness
and
affection
which
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
showed
the
latter
,
must
be
highly
disagreeable
to
her
,
*NL*
they
doubted
not
but
the
laying
hold
on
all
occasions
to
degrade
and
*NL*
vilify
him
,
would
be
highly
pleasing
to
her
;
who
,
as
she
hated
the
*NL*
boy
,
must
love
all
those
who
did
him
any
hurt
.
In
this
Thwackum
had
*NL*
the
advantage
;
for
while
Square
could
only
scarify
the
poor
lad
's
*NL*
reputation
,
he
could
flea
his
skin
;
and
,
indeed
,
he
considered
every
*NL*
lash
he
gave
him
as
a
compliment
paid
to
his
mistress
;
so
that
he
*NL*
could
,
with
the
utmost
propriety
,
repeat
this
old
flogging
line
,
*NL*
_
``
Castigo
te
non
quod
odio
habeam
,
sed
quod
_
AMEM
.
I
chastise
thee
not
*NL*
out
of
hatred
,
but
out
of
love
.
''
And
this
,
indeed
,
he
often
had
in
his
*NL*
mouth
,
or
rather
,
according
to
the
old
phrase
,
never
more
properly
*NL*
applied
,
at
his
fingers
'
ends
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
reason
,
principally
,
the
two
gentlemen
concurred
,
as
we
have
*NL*
seen
above
,
in
their
opinion
concerning
the
two
lads
;
this
being
,
*NL*
indeed
,
almost
the
only
instance
of
their
concurring
on
any
point
;
*NL*
for
,
beside
the
difference
of
their
principles
,
they
had
both
long
ago
*NL*
strongly
suspected
each
other
's
design
,
and
hated
one
another
with
no
*NL*
little
degree
of
inveteracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
mutual
animosity
was
a
good
deal
increased
by
their
alternate
*NL*
successes
;
for
Mrs
Blifil
knew
what
they
would
be
at
long
before
they
*NL*
imagined
it
;
or
,
indeed
,
intended
she
should
:
for
they
proceeded
with
*NL*
great
caution
,
lest
she
should
be
offended
,
and
acquaint
Mr
Allworthy
.
*NL*
But
they
had
no
reason
for
any
such
fear
;
she
was
well
enough
pleased
*NL*
with
a
passion
,
of
which
she
intended
none
should
have
any
fruits
but
*NL*
herself
.
And
the
only
fruits
she
designed
for
herself
were
,
flattery
*NL*
and
courtship
;
for
which
purpose
she
soothed
them
by
turns
,
and
a
long
*NL*
time
equally
.
She
was
,
indeed
,
rather
inclined
to
favour
the
parson
's
*NL*
principles
;
but
Square
's
person
was
more
agreeable
to
her
eye
,
for
he
*NL*
was
a
comely
man
;
whereas
the
pedagogue
did
in
countenance
very
nearly
*NL*
resemble
that
gentleman
,
who
,
in
the
Harlot
's
Progress
,
is
seen
*NL*
correcting
the
ladies
in
Bridewell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Mrs
Blifil
had
been
surfeited
with
the
sweets
of
marriage
,
or
*NL*
disgusted
by
its
bitters
,
or
from
what
other
cause
it
proceeded
,
I
*NL*
will
not
determine
;
but
she
could
never
be
brought
to
listen
to
any
*NL*
second
proposals
.
However
,
she
at
last
conversed
with
Square
with
such
*NL*
a
degree
of
intimacy
that
malicious
tongues
began
to
whisper
things
of
*NL*
her
,
to
which
,
as
well
for
the
sake
of
the
lady
,
as
that
they
were
*NL*
highly
disagreeable
to
the
rule
of
right
and
the
fitness
of
things
,
we
*NL*
will
give
no
credit
,
and
therefore
shall
not
blot
our
paper
with
them
.
*NL*
The
pedagogue
,
't
is
certain
,
whipped
on
,
without
getting
a
step
nearer
*NL*
to
his
journey
's
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
he
had
committed
a
great
error
,
and
that
Square
discovered
much
*NL*
sooner
than
himself
.
Mrs
Blifil
-LRB-
as
,
perhaps
,
the
reader
may
have
*NL*
formerly
guessed
-RRB-
was
not
over
and
above
pleased
with
the
behaviour
of
*NL*
her
husband
;
nay
,
to
be
honest
,
she
absolutely
hated
him
,
till
his
*NL*
death
at
last
a
little
reconciled
him
to
her
affections
.
It
will
not
*NL*
be
therefore
greatly
wondered
at
,
if
she
had
not
the
most
violent
*NL*
regard
to
the
offspring
she
had
by
him
.
And
,
in
fact
,
she
had
so
*NL*
little
of
this
regard
,
that
in
his
infancy
she
seldom
saw
her
son
,
or
*NL*
took
any
notice
of
him
;
and
hence
she
acquiesced
,
after
a
little
*NL*
reluctance
,
in
all
the
favours
which
Mr
Allworthy
showered
on
the
*NL*
foundling
;
whom
the
good
man
called
his
own
boy
,
and
in
all
things
put
*NL*
on
an
entire
equality
with
Master
Blifil
.
This
acquiescence
in
Mrs
*NL*
Blifil
was
considered
by
the
neighbours
,
and
by
the
family
,
as
a
mark
*NL*
of
her
condescension
to
her
brother
's
humour
,
and
she
was
imagined
by
*NL*
all
others
,
as
well
as
Thwackum
and
Square
,
to
hate
the
foundling
in
*NL*
her
heart
;
nay
,
the
more
civility
she
showed
him
,
the
more
they
*NL*
conceived
she
detested
him
,
and
the
surer
schemes
she
was
laying
for
*NL*
his
ruin
:
for
as
they
thought
it
her
interest
to
hate
him
,
it
was
very
*NL*
difficult
for
her
to
persuade
them
she
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
was
the
more
confirmed
in
his
opinion
,
as
she
had
more
than
*NL*
once
slily
caused
him
to
whip
Tom
Jones
,
when
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
was
an
*NL*
enemy
to
this
exercise
,
was
abroad
;
whereas
she
had
never
given
any
*NL*
such
orders
concerning
young
Blifil
.
And
this
had
likewise
imposed
*NL*
upon
Square
.
In
reality
,
though
she
certainly
hated
her
own
son
--
of
*NL*
which
,
however
monstrous
it
appears
,
I
am
assured
she
is
not
a
*NL*
singular
instance
--
she
appeared
,
notwithstanding
all
her
outward
*NL*
compliance
,
to
be
in
her
heart
sufficiently
displeased
with
all
the
*NL*
favour
shown
by
Mr
Allworthy
to
the
foundling
.
She
frequently
*NL*
complained
of
this
behind
her
brother
's
back
,
and
very
sharply
*NL*
censured
him
for
it
,
both
to
Thwackum
and
Square
;
nay
,
she
would
throw
*NL*
it
in
the
teeth
of
Allworthy
himself
,
when
a
little
quarrel
,
or
miff
,
*NL*
as
it
is
vulgarly
called
,
arose
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
when
Tom
grew
up
,
and
gave
tokens
of
that
gallantry
of
temper
*NL*
which
greatly
recommends
men
to
women
,
this
disinclination
which
she
*NL*
had
discovered
to
him
when
a
child
,
by
degrees
abated
,
and
at
last
she
*NL*
so
evidently
demonstrated
her
affection
to
him
to
be
much
stronger
*NL*
than
what
she
bore
her
own
son
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
her
*NL*
any
longer
.
She
was
so
desirous
of
often
seeing
him
,
and
discovered
*NL*
such
satisfaction
and
delight
in
his
company
,
that
before
he
was
*NL*
eighteen
years
old
he
was
become
a
rival
to
both
Square
and
Thwackum
;
*NL*
and
what
is
worse
,
the
whole
country
began
to
talk
as
loudly
of
her
*NL*
inclination
to
Tom
,
as
they
had
before
done
of
that
which
she
had
*NL*
shown
to
Square
:
on
which
account
the
philosopher
conceived
the
most
*NL*
implacable
hatred
for
our
poor
heroe
.

*NL*
Chapter
vii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
the
author
himself
makes
his
appearance
on
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Mr
Allworthy
was
not
of
himself
hasty
to
see
things
in
a
*NL*
disadvantageous
light
,
and
was
a
stranger
to
the
public
voice
,
which
*NL*
seldom
reaches
to
a
brother
or
a
husband
,
though
it
rings
in
the
ears
*NL*
of
all
the
neighbourhood
;
yet
was
this
affection
of
Mrs
Blifil
to
Tom
,
*NL*
and
the
preference
which
she
too
visibly
gave
him
to
her
own
son
,
of
*NL*
the
utmost
disadvantage
to
that
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
such
was
the
compassion
which
inhabited
Mr
Allworthy
's
mind
,
that
*NL*
nothing
but
the
steel
of
justice
could
ever
subdue
it
.
To
be
*NL*
unfortunate
in
any
respect
was
sufficient
,
if
there
was
no
demerit
to
*NL*
counterpoise
it
,
to
turn
the
scale
of
that
good
man
's
pity
,
and
to
*NL*
engage
his
friendship
and
his
benefaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
therefore
he
plainly
saw
Master
Blifil
was
absolutely
detested
*NL*
-LRB-
for
that
he
was
-RRB-
by
his
own
mother
,
he
began
,
on
that
account
only
,
*NL*
to
look
with
an
eye
of
compassion
upon
him
;
and
what
the
effects
of
*NL*
compassion
are
,
in
good
and
benevolent
minds
,
I
need
not
here
explain
*NL*
to
most
of
my
readers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henceforward
he
saw
every
appearance
of
virtue
in
the
youth
through
*NL*
the
magnifying
end
,
and
viewed
all
his
faults
with
the
glass
inverted
,
*NL*
so
that
they
became
scarce
perceptible
.
And
this
perhaps
the
amiable
*NL*
temper
of
pity
may
make
commendable
;
but
the
next
step
the
weakness
of
*NL*
human
nature
alone
must
excuse
;
for
he
no
sooner
perceived
that
*NL*
preference
which
Mrs
Blifil
gave
to
Tom
,
than
that
poor
youth
-LRB-
however
*NL*
innocent
-RRB-
began
to
sink
in
his
affections
as
he
rose
in
hers
.
This
,
it
*NL*
is
true
,
would
of
itself
alone
never
have
been
able
to
eradicate
Jones
*NL*
from
his
bosom
;
but
it
was
greatly
injurious
to
him
,
and
prepared
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
's
mind
for
those
impressions
which
afterwards
produced
the
*NL*
mighty
events
that
will
be
contained
hereafter
in
this
history
;
and
to
*NL*
which
,
it
must
be
confest
,
the
unfortunate
lad
,
by
his
own
wantonness
,
*NL*
wildness
,
and
want
of
caution
,
too
much
contributed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
recording
some
instances
of
these
,
we
shall
,
if
rightly
understood
,
*NL*
afford
a
very
useful
lesson
to
those
well-disposed
youths
who
shall
*NL*
hereafter
be
our
readers
;
for
they
may
here
find
,
that
goodness
of
*NL*
heart
,
and
openness
of
temper
,
though
these
may
give
them
great
*NL*
comfort
within
,
and
administer
to
an
honest
pride
in
their
own
minds
,
*NL*
will
by
no
means
,
alas
!
do
their
business
in
the
world
.
Prudence
and
*NL*
circumspection
are
necessary
even
to
the
best
of
men
.
They
are
indeed
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
a
guard
to
Virtue
,
without
which
she
can
never
be
safe
.
It
*NL*
is
not
enough
that
your
designs
,
nay
,
that
your
actions
,
are
*NL*
intrinsically
good
;
you
must
take
care
they
shall
appear
so
.
If
your
*NL*
inside
be
never
so
beautiful
,
you
must
preserve
a
fair
outside
also
.
*NL*
This
must
be
constantly
looked
to
,
or
malice
and
envy
will
take
care
*NL*
to
blacken
it
so
,
that
the
sagacity
and
goodness
of
an
Allworthy
will
*NL*
not
be
able
to
see
through
it
,
and
to
discern
the
beauties
within
.
Let
*NL*
this
,
my
young
readers
,
be
your
constant
maxim
,
that
no
man
can
be
*NL*
good
enough
to
enable
him
to
neglect
the
rules
of
prudence
;
nor
will
*NL*
Virtue
herself
look
beautiful
,
unless
she
be
bedecked
with
the
outward
*NL*
ornaments
of
decency
and
decorum
.
And
this
precept
,
my
worthy
*NL*
disciples
,
if
you
read
with
due
attention
,
you
will
,
I
hope
,
find
*NL*
sufficiently
enforced
by
examples
in
the
following
pages
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ask
pardon
for
this
short
appearance
,
by
way
of
chorus
,
on
the
*NL*
stage
.
It
is
in
reality
for
my
own
sake
,
that
,
while
I
am
discovering
*NL*
the
rocks
on
which
innocence
and
goodness
often
split
,
I
may
not
be
*NL*
misunderstood
to
recommend
the
very
means
to
my
worthy
readers
,
by
*NL*
which
I
intend
to
show
them
they
will
be
undone
.
And
this
,
as
I
could
*NL*
not
prevail
on
any
of
my
actors
to
speak
,
I
myself
was
obliged
to
*NL*
declare
.

Chapter
viii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
childish
incident
,
in
which
,
however
,
is
seen
a
good-natured
*NL*
disposition
in
Tom
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
remember
that
Mr
Allworthy
gave
Tom
Jones
a
little
*NL*
horse
,
as
a
kind
of
smart-money
for
the
punishment
which
he
imagined
*NL*
he
had
suffered
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
horse
Tom
kept
above
half
a
year
,
and
then
rode
him
to
a
*NL*
neighbouring
fair
,
and
sold
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
return
,
being
questioned
by
Thwackum
what
he
had
done
with
the
*NL*
money
for
which
the
horse
was
sold
,
he
frankly
declared
he
would
not
*NL*
tell
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
!
''
says
Thwackum
,
``
you
will
not
!
then
I
will
have
it
out
of
your
*NL*
br
--
h
;
''
that
being
the
place
to
which
he
always
applied
for
*NL*
information
on
every
doubtful
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
now
mounted
on
the
back
of
a
footman
,
and
everything
prepared
*NL*
for
execution
,
when
Mr
Allworthy
,
entering
the
room
,
gave
the
criminal
*NL*
a
reprieve
,
and
took
him
with
him
into
another
apartment
;
where
,
being
*NL*
alone
with
Tom
,
he
put
the
same
question
to
him
which
Thwackum
had
*NL*
before
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
answered
,
he
could
in
duty
refuse
him
nothing
;
but
as
for
that
*NL*
tyrannical
rascal
,
he
would
never
make
him
any
other
answer
than
with
*NL*
a
cudgel
,
with
which
he
hoped
soon
to
be
able
to
pay
him
for
all
his
*NL*
barbarities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
very
severely
reprimanded
the
lad
for
his
indecent
and
*NL*
disrespectful
expressions
concerning
his
master
;
but
much
more
for
his
*NL*
avowing
an
intention
of
revenge
.
He
threatened
him
with
the
entire
*NL*
loss
of
his
favour
,
if
he
ever
heard
such
another
word
from
his
mouth
;
*NL*
for
,
he
said
,
he
would
never
support
or
befriend
a
reprobate
.
By
these
*NL*
and
the
like
declarations
,
he
extorted
some
compunction
from
Tom
,
in
*NL*
which
that
youth
was
not
over-sincere
;
for
he
really
meditated
some
*NL*
return
for
all
the
smarting
favours
he
had
received
at
the
hands
of
*NL*
the
pedagogue
.
He
was
,
however
,
brought
by
Mr
Allworthy
to
express
a
*NL*
concern
for
his
resentment
against
Thwackum
;
and
then
the
good
man
,
*NL*
after
some
wholesome
admonition
,
permitted
him
to
proceed
,
which
he
*NL*
did
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
my
dear
sir
,
I
love
and
honour
you
more
than
all
the
world
:
I
*NL*
know
the
great
obligations
I
have
to
you
,
and
should
detest
myself
if
*NL*
I
thought
my
heart
was
capable
of
ingratitude
.
Could
the
little
horse
*NL*
you
gave
me
speak
,
I
am
sure
he
could
tell
you
how
fond
I
was
of
your
*NL*
present
;
for
I
had
more
pleasure
in
feeding
him
than
in
riding
him
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
sir
,
it
went
to
my
heart
to
part
with
him
;
nor
would
I
have
*NL*
sold
him
upon
any
other
account
in
the
world
than
what
I
did
.
You
*NL*
yourself
,
sir
,
I
am
convinced
,
in
my
case
,
would
have
done
the
same
:
*NL*
for
none
ever
so
sensibly
felt
the
misfortunes
of
others
.
What
would
*NL*
you
feel
,
dear
sir
,
if
you
thought
yourself
the
occasion
of
them
?
*NL*
Indeed
,
sir
,
there
never
was
any
misery
like
theirs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
whose
,
child
?
''
says
Allworthy
:
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
!
''
answered
Tom
,
``
your
poor
gamekeeper
,
with
all
his
large
*NL*
family
,
ever
since
your
discarding
him
,
have
been
perishing
with
all
*NL*
the
miseries
of
cold
and
hunger
:
I
could
not
bear
to
see
these
poor
*NL*
wretches
naked
and
starving
,
and
at
the
same
time
know
myself
to
have
*NL*
been
the
occasion
of
all
their
sufferings
.
I
could
not
bear
it
,
sir
;
*NL*
upon
my
soul
,
I
could
not
.
''
-LSB-
Here
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
,
and
*NL*
he
thus
proceeded
.
-RSB-
``
It
was
to
save
them
from
absolute
destruction
I
*NL*
parted
with
your
dear
present
,
notwithstanding
all
the
value
I
had
for
*NL*
it
:
I
sold
the
horse
for
them
,
and
they
have
every
farthing
of
the
*NL*
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
now
stood
silent
for
some
moments
,
and
before
he
spoke
*NL*
the
tears
started
from
his
eyes
.
He
at
length
dismissed
Tom
with
a
*NL*
gentle
rebuke
,
advising
him
for
the
future
to
apply
to
him
in
cases
of
*NL*
distress
,
rather
than
to
use
extraordinary
means
of
relieving
them
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
affair
was
afterwards
the
subject
of
much
debate
between
Thwackum
*NL*
and
Square
.
Thwackum
held
,
that
this
was
flying
in
Mr
Allworthy
's
*NL*
face
,
who
had
intended
to
punish
the
fellow
for
his
disobedience
.
He
*NL*
said
,
in
some
instances
,
what
the
world
called
charity
appeared
to
him
*NL*
to
be
opposing
the
will
of
the
Almighty
,
which
had
marked
some
*NL*
particular
persons
for
destruction
;
and
that
this
was
in
like
manner
*NL*
acting
in
opposition
to
Mr
Allworthy
;
concluding
,
as
usual
,
with
a
*NL*
hearty
recommendation
of
birch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Square
argued
strongly
on
the
other
side
,
in
opposition
perhaps
to
*NL*
Thwackum
,
or
in
compliance
with
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
seemed
very
much
to
*NL*
approve
what
Jones
had
done
.
As
to
what
he
urged
on
this
occasion
,
as
*NL*
I
am
convinced
most
of
my
readers
will
be
much
abler
advocates
for
*NL*
poor
Jones
,
it
would
be
impertinent
to
relate
it
.
Indeed
it
was
not
*NL*
difficult
to
reconcile
to
the
rule
of
right
an
action
which
it
would
*NL*
have
been
impossible
to
deduce
from
the
rule
of
wrong
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
ix
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
an
incident
of
a
more
heinous
kind
,
with
the
comments
of
*NL*
Thwackum
and
Square
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
hath
been
observed
by
some
man
of
much
greater
reputation
for
*NL*
wisdom
than
myself
,
that
misfortunes
seldom
come
single
.
An
instance
*NL*
of
this
may
,
I
believe
,
be
seen
in
those
gentlemen
who
have
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
have
any
of
their
rogueries
detected
;
for
here
discovery
*NL*
seldom
stops
till
the
whole
is
come
out
.
Thus
it
happened
to
poor
Tom
;
*NL*
who
was
no
sooner
pardoned
for
selling
the
horse
,
than
he
was
*NL*
discovered
to
have
some
time
before
sold
a
fine
Bible
which
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
gave
him
,
the
money
arising
from
which
sale
he
had
disposed
*NL*
of
in
the
same
manner
.
This
Bible
Master
Blifil
had
purchased
,
though
*NL*
he
had
already
such
another
of
his
own
,
partly
out
of
respect
for
the
*NL*
book
,
and
partly
out
of
friendship
to
Tom
,
being
unwilling
that
the
*NL*
Bible
should
be
sold
out
of
the
family
at
half-price
.
He
therefore
*NL*
deposited
the
said
half-price
himself
;
for
he
was
a
very
prudent
lad
,
*NL*
and
so
careful
of
his
money
,
that
he
had
laid
up
almost
every
penny
*NL*
which
he
had
received
from
Mr
Allworthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
people
have
been
noted
to
be
able
to
read
in
no
book
but
their
*NL*
own
.
On
the
contrary
,
from
the
time
when
Master
Blifil
was
first
*NL*
possessed
of
this
Bible
,
he
never
used
any
other
.
Nay
,
he
was
seen
*NL*
reading
in
it
much
oftener
than
he
had
before
been
in
his
own
.
Now
,
as
*NL*
he
frequently
asked
Thwackum
to
explain
difficult
passages
to
him
,
*NL*
that
gentleman
unfortunately
took
notice
of
Tom
's
name
,
which
was
*NL*
written
in
many
parts
of
the
book
.
This
brought
on
an
inquiry
,
which
*NL*
obliged
Master
Blifil
to
discover
the
whole
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
was
resolved
a
crime
of
this
kind
,
which
he
called
sacrilege
,
*NL*
should
not
go
unpunished
.
He
therefore
proceeded
immediately
to
*NL*
castigation
:
and
not
contented
with
that
he
acquainted
Mr
Allworthy
,
*NL*
at
their
next
meeting
,
with
this
monstrous
crime
,
as
it
appeared
to
*NL*
him
:
inveighing
against
Tom
in
the
most
bitter
terms
,
and
likening
him
*NL*
to
the
buyers
and
sellers
who
were
driven
out
of
the
temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Square
saw
this
matter
in
a
very
different
light
.
He
said
,
he
could
*NL*
not
perceive
any
higher
crime
in
selling
one
book
than
in
selling
*NL*
another
.
That
to
sell
Bibles
was
strictly
lawful
by
all
laws
both
*NL*
Divine
and
human
,
and
consequently
there
was
no
unfitness
in
it
.
He
*NL*
told
Thwackum
,
that
his
great
concern
on
this
occasion
brought
to
his
*NL*
mind
the
story
of
a
very
devout
woman
,
who
,
out
of
pure
regard
to
*NL*
religion
,
stole
Tillotson
's
Sermons
from
a
lady
of
her
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
story
caused
a
vast
quantity
of
blood
to
rush
into
the
parson
's
*NL*
face
,
which
of
itself
was
none
of
the
palest
;
and
he
was
going
to
*NL*
reply
with
great
warmth
and
anger
,
had
not
Mrs
Blifil
,
who
was
present
*NL*
at
this
debate
,
interposed
.
That
lady
declared
herself
absolutely
of
*NL*
Mr
Square
's
side
.
She
argued
,
indeed
,
very
learnedly
in
support
of
his
*NL*
opinion
;
and
concluded
with
saying
,
if
Tom
had
been
guilty
of
any
*NL*
fault
,
she
must
confess
her
own
son
appeared
to
be
equally
culpable
;
*NL*
for
that
she
could
see
no
difference
between
the
buyer
and
the
seller
;
*NL*
both
of
whom
were
alike
to
be
driven
out
of
the
temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Blifil
having
declared
her
opinion
,
put
an
end
to
the
debate
.
*NL*
Square
's
triumph
would
almost
have
stopt
his
words
,
had
he
needed
*NL*
them
;
and
Thwackum
,
who
,
for
reasons
before-mentioned
,
durst
not
*NL*
venture
at
disobliging
the
lady
,
was
almost
choaked
with
indignation
.
*NL*
As
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
he
said
,
since
the
boy
had
been
already
punished
*NL*
he
would
not
deliver
his
sentiments
on
the
occasion
;
and
whether
he
*NL*
was
or
was
not
angry
with
the
lad
,
I
must
leave
to
the
reader
's
own
*NL*
conjecture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
this
,
an
action
was
brought
against
the
gamekeeper
by
*NL*
Squire
Western
-LRB-
the
gentleman
in
whose
manor
the
partridge
was
*NL*
killed
-RRB-
,
for
depredations
of
the
like
kind
.
This
was
a
most
*NL*
unfortunate
circumstance
for
the
fellow
,
as
it
not
only
of
itself
*NL*
threatened
his
ruin
,
but
actually
prevented
Mr
Allworthy
from
*NL*
restoring
him
to
his
favour
:
for
as
that
gentleman
was
walking
out
one
*NL*
evening
with
Master
Blifil
and
young
Jones
,
the
latter
slily
drew
him
*NL*
to
the
habitation
of
Black
George
;
where
the
family
of
that
poor
*NL*
wretch
,
namely
,
his
wife
and
children
,
were
found
in
all
the
misery
*NL*
with
which
cold
,
hunger
,
and
nakedness
,
can
affect
human
creatures
:
*NL*
for
as
to
the
money
they
had
received
from
Jones
,
former
debts
had
*NL*
consumed
almost
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
scene
as
this
could
not
fail
of
affecting
the
heart
of
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
.
He
immediately
gave
the
mother
a
couple
of
guineas
,
with
*NL*
which
he
bid
her
cloath
her
children
.
The
poor
woman
burst
into
tears
*NL*
at
this
goodness
,
and
while
she
was
thanking
him
,
could
not
refrain
*NL*
from
expressing
her
gratitude
to
Tom
;
who
had
,
she
said
,
long
*NL*
preserved
both
her
and
hers
from
starving
.
``
We
have
not
,
''
says
she
,
*NL*
``
had
a
morsel
to
eat
,
nor
have
these
poor
children
had
a
rag
to
put
*NL*
on
,
but
what
his
goodness
hath
bestowed
on
us
.
''
For
,
indeed
,
besides
*NL*
the
horse
and
the
Bible
,
Tom
had
sacrificed
a
night-gown
,
and
other
*NL*
things
,
to
the
use
of
this
distressed
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
their
return
home
,
Tom
made
use
of
all
his
eloquence
to
display
the
*NL*
wretchedness
of
these
people
,
and
the
penitence
of
Black
George
*NL*
himself
;
and
in
this
he
succeeded
so
well
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
said
,
he
*NL*
thought
the
man
had
suffered
enough
for
what
was
past
;
that
he
would
*NL*
forgive
him
,
and
think
of
some
means
of
providing
for
him
and
his
*NL*
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
so
delighted
with
this
news
,
that
,
though
it
was
dark
when
*NL*
they
returned
home
,
he
could
not
help
going
back
a
mile
,
in
a
shower
*NL*
of
rain
,
to
acquaint
the
poor
woman
with
the
glad
tidings
;
but
,
like
*NL*
other
hasty
divulgers
of
news
,
he
only
brought
on
himself
the
trouble
*NL*
of
contradicting
it
:
for
the
ill
fortune
of
Black
George
made
use
of
*NL*
the
very
opportunity
of
his
friend
's
absence
to
overturn
all
again
.

Chapter
x
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
Master
Blifil
and
Jones
appear
in
different
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Blifil
fell
very
short
of
his
companion
in
the
amiable
quality
*NL*
of
mercy
;
but
he
as
greatly
exceeded
him
in
one
of
a
much
higher
kind
,
*NL*
namely
,
in
justice
:
in
which
he
followed
both
the
precepts
and
example
*NL*
of
Thwackum
and
Square
;
for
though
they
would
both
make
frequent
use
*NL*
of
the
word
mercy
,
yet
it
was
plain
that
in
reality
Square
held
it
to
*NL*
be
inconsistent
with
the
rule
of
right
;
and
Thwackum
was
for
doing
*NL*
justice
,
and
leaving
mercy
to
heaven
.
The
two
gentlemen
did
indeed
*NL*
somewhat
differ
in
opinion
concerning
the
objects
of
this
sublime
*NL*
virtue
;
by
which
Thwackum
would
probably
have
destroyed
one
half
of
*NL*
mankind
,
and
Square
the
other
half
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Blifil
then
,
though
he
had
kept
silence
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
Jones
,
yet
,
when
he
had
better
considered
the
matter
,
could
by
no
*NL*
means
endure
the
thought
of
suffering
his
uncle
to
confer
favours
on
*NL*
the
undeserving
.
He
therefore
resolved
immediately
to
acquaint
him
*NL*
with
the
fact
which
we
have
above
slightly
hinted
to
the
readers
.
The
*NL*
truth
of
which
was
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamekeeper
,
about
a
year
after
he
was
dismissed
from
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
's
service
,
and
before
Tom
's
selling
the
horse
,
being
in
want
*NL*
of
bread
,
either
to
fill
his
own
mouth
or
those
of
his
family
,
as
he
*NL*
passed
through
a
field
belonging
to
Mr
Western
espied
a
hare
sitting
*NL*
in
her
form
.
This
hare
he
had
basely
and
barbarously
knocked
on
the
*NL*
head
,
against
the
laws
of
the
land
,
and
no
less
against
the
laws
of
*NL*
sportsmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
higgler
to
whom
the
hare
was
sold
,
being
unfortunately
taken
many
*NL*
months
after
with
a
quantity
of
game
upon
him
,
was
obliged
to
make
his
*NL*
peace
with
the
squire
,
by
becoming
evidence
against
some
poacher
.
And
*NL*
now
Black
George
was
pitched
upon
by
him
,
as
being
a
person
already
*NL*
obnoxious
to
Mr
Western
,
and
one
of
no
good
fame
in
the
country
.
He
*NL*
was
,
besides
,
the
best
sacrifice
the
higgler
could
make
,
as
he
had
*NL*
supplied
him
with
no
game
since
;
and
by
this
means
the
witness
had
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
screening
his
better
customers
:
for
the
squire
,
being
*NL*
charmed
with
the
power
of
punishing
Black
George
,
whom
a
single
*NL*
transgression
was
sufficient
to
ruin
,
made
no
further
enquiry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
this
fact
been
truly
laid
before
Mr
Allworthy
,
it
might
probably
*NL*
have
done
the
gamekeeper
very
little
mischief
.
But
there
is
no
zeal
*NL*
blinder
than
that
which
is
inspired
with
the
love
of
justice
against
*NL*
offenders
.
Master
Blifil
had
forgot
the
distance
of
the
time
.
He
*NL*
varied
likewise
in
the
manner
of
the
fact
:
and
by
the
hasty
addition
*NL*
of
the
single
letter
S
he
considerably
altered
the
story
;
for
he
said
*NL*
that
George
had
wired
hares
.
These
alterations
might
probably
have
*NL*
been
set
right
,
had
not
Master
Blifil
unluckily
insisted
on
a
promise
*NL*
of
secrecy
from
Mr
Allworthy
before
he
revealed
the
matter
to
him
;
but
*NL*
by
that
means
the
poor
gamekeeper
was
condemned
without
having
an
*NL*
opportunity
to
defend
himself
:
for
as
the
fact
of
killing
the
hare
,
*NL*
and
of
the
action
brought
,
were
certainly
true
,
Mr
Allworthy
had
no
*NL*
doubt
concerning
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Short-lived
then
was
the
joy
of
these
poor
people
;
for
Mr
Allworthy
*NL*
the
next
morning
declared
he
had
fresh
reason
,
without
assigning
it
,
*NL*
for
his
anger
,
and
strictly
forbad
Tom
to
mention
George
any
more
:
*NL*
though
as
for
his
family
,
he
said
he
would
endeavour
to
keep
them
from
*NL*
starving
;
but
as
to
the
fellow
himself
,
he
would
leave
him
to
the
*NL*
laws
,
which
nothing
could
keep
him
from
breaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
could
by
no
means
divine
what
had
incensed
Mr
Allworthy
,
for
of
*NL*
Master
Blifil
he
had
not
the
least
suspicion
.
However
,
as
his
*NL*
friendship
was
to
be
tired
out
by
no
disappointments
,
he
now
*NL*
determined
to
try
another
method
of
preserving
the
poor
gamekeeper
*NL*
from
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
lately
grown
very
intimate
with
Mr
Western
.
He
had
so
*NL*
greatly
recommended
himself
to
that
gentleman
,
by
leaping
over
*NL*
five-barred
gates
,
and
by
other
acts
of
sportsmanship
,
that
the
squire
*NL*
had
declared
Tom
would
certainly
make
a
great
man
if
he
had
but
*NL*
sufficient
encouragement
.
He
often
wished
he
had
himself
a
son
with
*NL*
such
parts
;
and
one
day
very
solemnly
asserted
at
a
drinking
bout
,
*NL*
that
Tom
should
hunt
a
pack
of
hounds
for
a
thousand
pound
of
his
*NL*
money
,
with
any
huntsman
in
the
whole
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
such
kind
of
talents
he
had
so
ingratiated
himself
with
the
squire
,
*NL*
that
he
was
a
most
welcome
guest
at
his
table
,
and
a
favourite
*NL*
companion
in
his
sport
:
everything
which
the
squire
held
most
dear
,
to
*NL*
wit
,
his
guns
,
dogs
,
and
horses
,
were
now
as
much
at
the
command
of
*NL*
Jones
,
as
if
they
had
been
his
own
.
He
resolved
therefore
to
make
use
*NL*
of
this
favour
on
behalf
of
his
friend
Black
George
,
whom
he
hoped
to
*NL*
introduce
into
Mr
Western
's
family
,
in
the
same
capacity
in
which
he
*NL*
had
before
served
Mr
Allworthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
,
if
he
considers
that
this
fellow
was
already
obnoxious
to
*NL*
Mr
Western
,
and
if
he
considers
farther
the
weighty
business
by
which
*NL*
that
gentleman
's
displeasure
had
been
incurred
,
will
perhaps
condemn
*NL*
this
as
a
foolish
and
desperate
undertaking
;
but
if
he
should
totally
*NL*
condemn
young
Jones
on
that
account
,
he
will
greatly
applaud
him
for
*NL*
strengthening
himself
with
all
imaginable
interest
on
so
arduous
an
*NL*
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
purpose
,
then
,
Tom
applied
to
Mr
Western
's
daughter
,
a
young
*NL*
lady
of
about
seventeen
years
of
age
,
whom
her
father
,
next
after
*NL*
those
necessary
implements
of
sport
just
before
mentioned
,
loved
and
*NL*
esteemed
above
all
the
world
.
Now
,
as
she
had
some
influence
on
the
*NL*
squire
,
so
Tom
had
some
little
influence
on
her
.
But
this
being
the
*NL*
intended
heroine
of
this
work
,
a
lady
with
whom
we
ourselves
are
*NL*
greatly
in
love
,
and
with
whom
many
of
our
readers
will
probably
be
in
*NL*
love
too
,
before
we
part
,
it
is
by
no
means
proper
she
should
make
her
*NL*
appearance
at
the
end
of
a
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
BOOK
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
CONTAINING
THE
TIME
OF
A
YEAR
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
five
pages
of
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
truth
distinguishes
our
writings
from
those
idle
romances
which
are
*NL*
filled
with
monsters
,
the
productions
,
not
of
nature
,
but
of
*NL*
distempered
brains
;
and
which
have
been
therefore
recommended
by
an
*NL*
eminent
critic
to
the
sole
use
of
the
pastry-cook
;
so
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
we
would
avoid
any
resemblance
to
that
kind
of
history
which
a
*NL*
celebrated
poet
seems
to
think
is
no
less
calculated
for
the
emolument
*NL*
of
the
brewer
,
as
the
reading
it
should
be
always
attended
with
a
*NL*
tankard
of
good
ale
--
*NL*
*NL*
While
--
history
with
her
comrade
ale
,
*NL*
Soothes
the
sad
series
of
her
serious
tale
*NL*
*NL*
For
as
this
is
the
liquor
of
modern
historians
,
nay
,
perhaps
their
*NL*
muse
,
if
we
may
believe
the
opinion
of
Butler
,
who
attributes
*NL*
inspiration
to
ale
,
it
ought
likewise
to
be
the
potation
of
their
*NL*
readers
,
since
every
book
ought
to
be
read
with
the
same
spirit
and
in
*NL*
the
same
manner
as
it
is
writ
.
Thus
the
famous
author
of
Hurlothrumbo
*NL*
told
a
learned
bishop
,
that
the
reason
his
lordship
could
not
taste
*NL*
the
excellence
of
his
piece
was
,
that
he
did
not
read
it
with
a
fiddle
*NL*
in
his
hand
;
which
instrument
he
himself
had
always
had
in
his
own
,
*NL*
when
he
composed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
our
work
,
therefore
,
might
be
in
no
danger
of
being
likened
to
*NL*
the
labours
of
these
historians
,
we
have
taken
every
occasion
of
*NL*
interspersing
through
the
whole
sundry
similes
,
descriptions
,
and
*NL*
other
kind
of
poetical
embellishments
.
These
are
,
indeed
,
designed
to
*NL*
supply
the
place
of
the
said
ale
,
and
to
refresh
the
mind
,
whenever
*NL*
those
slumbers
,
which
in
a
long
work
are
apt
to
invade
the
reader
as
*NL*
well
as
the
writer
,
shall
begin
to
creep
upon
him
.
Without
*NL*
interruptions
of
this
kind
,
the
best
narrative
of
plain
matter
of
fact
*NL*
must
overpower
every
reader
;
for
nothing
but
the
ever
lasting
*NL*
watchfulness
,
which
Homer
has
ascribed
only
to
Jove
himself
,
can
be
*NL*
proof
against
a
newspaper
of
many
volumes
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
leave
to
the
reader
to
determine
with
what
judgment
we
have
*NL*
chosen
the
several
occasions
for
inserting
those
ornamental
parts
of
*NL*
our
work
.
Surely
it
will
be
allowed
that
none
could
be
more
proper
*NL*
than
the
present
,
where
we
are
about
to
introduce
a
considerable
*NL*
character
on
the
scene
;
no
less
,
indeed
,
than
the
heroine
of
this
*NL*
heroic
,
historical
,
prosaic
poem
.
Here
,
therefore
,
we
have
thought
*NL*
proper
to
prepare
the
mind
of
the
reader
for
her
reception
,
by
filling
*NL*
it
with
every
pleasing
image
which
we
can
draw
from
the
face
of
*NL*
nature
.
And
for
this
method
we
plead
many
precedents
.
First
,
this
is
*NL*
an
art
well
known
to
,
and
much
practised
by
,
our
tragick
poets
,
who
*NL*
seldom
fail
to
prepare
their
audience
for
the
reception
of
their
*NL*
principal
characters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
heroe
is
always
introduced
with
a
flourish
of
drums
and
*NL*
trumpets
,
in
order
to
rouse
a
martial
spirit
in
the
audience
,
and
to
*NL*
accommodate
their
ears
to
bombast
and
fustian
,
which
Mr
Locke
's
blind
*NL*
man
would
not
have
grossly
erred
in
likening
to
the
sound
of
a
*NL*
trumpet
.
Again
,
when
lovers
are
coming
forth
,
soft
music
often
*NL*
conducts
them
on
the
stage
,
either
to
soothe
the
audience
with
the
*NL*
softness
of
the
tender
passion
,
or
to
lull
and
prepare
them
for
that
*NL*
gentle
slumber
in
which
they
will
most
probably
be
composed
by
the
*NL*
ensuing
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
not
only
the
poets
,
but
the
masters
of
these
poets
,
the
managers
*NL*
of
playhouses
,
seem
to
be
in
this
secret
;
for
,
besides
the
aforesaid
*NL*
kettle-drums
,
&
c.
,
which
denote
the
heroe
's
approach
,
he
is
generally
*NL*
ushered
on
the
stage
by
a
large
troop
of
half
a
dozen
scene-shifters
;
*NL*
and
how
necessary
these
are
imagined
to
his
appearance
,
may
be
*NL*
concluded
from
the
following
theatrical
story
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
King
Pyrrhus
was
at
dinner
at
an
ale-house
bordering
on
the
theatre
,
*NL*
when
he
was
summoned
to
go
on
the
stage
.
The
heroe
,
being
unwilling
to
*NL*
quit
his
shoulder
of
mutton
,
and
as
unwilling
to
draw
on
himself
the
*NL*
indignation
of
Mr
Wilks
-LRB-
his
brother-manager
-RRB-
for
making
the
audience
*NL*
wait
,
had
bribed
these
his
harbingers
to
be
out
of
the
way
.
While
Mr
*NL*
Wilks
,
therefore
,
was
thundering
out
,
``
Where
are
the
carpenters
to
*NL*
walk
on
before
King
Pyrrhus
?
''
that
monarch
very
quietly
eat
his
*NL*
mutton
,
and
the
audience
,
however
impatient
,
were
obliged
to
entertain
*NL*
themselves
with
music
in
his
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
plain
,
I
much
question
whether
the
politician
,
who
hath
*NL*
generally
a
good
nose
,
hath
not
scented
out
somewhat
of
the
utility
of
*NL*
this
practice
.
I
am
convinced
that
awful
magistrate
my
lord-mayor
*NL*
contracts
a
good
deal
of
that
reverence
which
attends
him
through
the
*NL*
year
,
by
the
several
pageants
which
precede
his
pomp
.
Nay
,
I
must
*NL*
confess
,
that
even
I
myself
,
who
am
not
remarkably
liable
to
be
*NL*
captivated
with
show
,
have
yielded
not
a
little
to
the
impressions
of
*NL*
much
preceding
state
.
When
I
have
seen
a
man
strutting
in
a
*NL*
procession
,
after
others
whose
business
was
only
to
walk
before
him
,
I
*NL*
have
conceived
a
higher
notion
of
his
dignity
than
I
have
felt
on
*NL*
seeing
him
in
a
common
situation
.
But
there
is
one
instance
,
which
*NL*
comes
exactly
up
to
my
purpose
.
This
is
the
custom
of
sending
on
a
*NL*
basket-woman
,
who
is
to
precede
the
pomp
at
a
coronation
,
and
to
strew
*NL*
the
stage
with
flowers
,
before
the
great
personages
begin
their
*NL*
procession
.
The
antients
would
certainly
have
invoked
the
goddess
*NL*
Flora
for
this
purpose
,
and
it
would
have
been
no
difficulty
for
their
*NL*
priests
,
or
politicians
to
have
persuaded
the
people
of
the
real
*NL*
presence
of
the
deity
,
though
a
plain
mortal
had
personated
her
and
*NL*
performed
her
office
.
But
we
have
no
such
design
of
imposing
on
our
*NL*
reader
;
and
therefore
those
who
object
to
the
heathen
theology
,
may
,
*NL*
if
they
please
,
change
our
goddess
into
the
above-mentioned
*NL*
basket-woman
.
Our
intention
,
in
short
,
is
to
introduce
our
heroine
*NL*
with
the
utmost
solemnity
in
our
power
,
with
an
elevation
of
stile
,
*NL*
and
all
other
circumstances
proper
to
raise
the
veneration
of
our
*NL*
reader
.
--
Indeed
we
would
,
for
certain
causes
,
advise
those
of
our
male
*NL*
readers
who
have
any
hearts
,
to
read
no
farther
,
were
we
not
well
*NL*
assured
,
that
how
amiable
soever
the
picture
of
our
heroine
will
*NL*
appear
,
as
it
is
really
a
copy
from
nature
,
many
of
our
fair
*NL*
countrywomen
will
be
found
worthy
to
satisfy
any
passion
,
and
to
*NL*
answer
any
idea
of
female
perfection
which
our
pencil
will
be
able
to
*NL*
raise
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
without
any
further
preface
,
we
proceed
to
our
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
ii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
hint
of
what
we
can
do
in
the
sublime
,
and
a
description
of
*NL*
Miss
Sophia
Western
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Hushed
be
every
ruder
breath
.
May
the
heathen
ruler
of
the
winds
*NL*
confine
in
iron
chains
the
boisterous
limbs
of
noisy
Boreas
,
and
the
*NL*
sharp-pointed
nose
of
bitter-biting
Eurus
.
Do
thou
,
sweet
Zephyrus
,
*NL*
rising
from
thy
fragrant
bed
,
mount
the
western
sky
,
and
lead
on
those
*NL*
delicious
gales
,
the
charms
of
which
call
forth
the
lovely
Flora
from
*NL*
her
chamber
,
perfumed
with
pearly
dews
,
when
on
the
1st
of
June
,
her
*NL*
birth-day
,
the
blooming
maid
,
in
loose
attire
,
gently
trips
it
over
*NL*
the
verdant
mead
,
where
every
flower
rises
to
do
her
homage
,
till
the
*NL*
whole
field
becomes
enamelled
,
and
colours
contend
with
sweets
which
*NL*
shall
ravish
her
most
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
charming
may
she
now
appear
!
and
you
the
feathered
choristers
of
*NL*
nature
,
whose
sweetest
notes
not
even
Handel
can
excell
,
tune
your
*NL*
melodious
throats
to
celebrate
her
appearance
.
From
love
proceeds
your
*NL*
music
,
and
to
love
it
returns
.
Awaken
therefore
that
gentle
passion
in
*NL*
every
swain
:
for
lo
!
adorned
with
all
the
charms
in
which
nature
can
*NL*
array
her
;
bedecked
with
beauty
,
youth
,
sprightliness
,
innocence
,
*NL*
modesty
,
and
tenderness
,
breathing
sweetness
from
her
rosy
lips
,
and
*NL*
darting
brightness
from
her
sparkling
eyes
,
the
lovely
Sophia
comes
!
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
perhaps
thou
hast
seen
the
statue
of
the
_
Venus
de
Medicis
_
.
*NL*
Perhaps
,
too
,
thou
hast
seen
the
gallery
of
beauties
at
Hampton
Court
.
*NL*
Thou
may
`
st
remember
each
bright
Churchill
of
the
galaxy
,
and
all
the
*NL*
toasts
of
the
Kit-cat
.
Or
,
if
their
reign
was
before
thy
times
,
at
*NL*
least
thou
hast
seen
their
daughters
,
the
no
less
dazzling
beauties
of
*NL*
the
present
age
;
whose
names
,
should
we
here
insert
,
we
apprehend
they
*NL*
would
fill
the
whole

*NL*
Now
if
thou
hast
seen
all
these
,
be
not
afraid
of
the
rude
answer
*NL*
which
Lord
Rochester
once
gave
to
a
man
who
had
seen
many
things
.
No
.
*NL*
If
thou
hast
seen
all
these
without
knowing
what
beauty
is
,
thou
hast
*NL*
no
eyes
;
if
without
feeling
its
power
,
thou
hast
no
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
is
it
possible
,
my
friend
,
that
thou
mayest
have
seen
all
these
*NL*
without
being
able
to
form
an
exact
idea
of
Sophia
;
for
she
did
not
*NL*
exactly
resemble
any
of
them
.
She
was
most
like
the
picture
of
Lady
*NL*
Ranelagh
:
and
,
I
have
heard
,
more
still
to
the
famous
dutchess
of
*NL*
Mazarine
;
but
most
of
all
she
resembled
one
whose
image
never
can
*NL*
depart
from
my
breast
,
and
whom
,
if
thou
dost
remember
,
thou
hast
*NL*
then
,
my
friend
,
an
adequate
idea
of
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
lest
this
should
not
have
been
thy
fortune
,
we
will
endeavour
with
*NL*
our
utmost
skill
to
describe
this
paragon
,
though
we
are
sensible
that
*NL*
our
highest
abilities
are
very
inadequate
to
the
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
then
,
the
only
daughter
of
Mr
Western
,
was
a
middle-sized
*NL*
woman
;
but
rather
inclining
to
tall
.
Her
shape
was
not
only
exact
,
but
*NL*
extremely
delicate
:
and
the
nice
proportion
of
her
arms
promised
the
*NL*
truest
symmetry
in
her
limbs
.
Her
hair
,
which
was
black
,
was
so
*NL*
luxuriant
,
that
it
reached
her
middle
,
before
she
cut
it
to
comply
*NL*
with
the
modern
fashion
;
and
it
was
now
curled
so
gracefully
in
her
*NL*
neck
,
that
few
could
believe
it
to
be
her
own
.
If
envy
could
find
any
*NL*
part
of
the
face
which
demanded
less
commendation
than
the
rest
,
it
*NL*
might
possibly
think
her
forehead
might
have
been
higher
without
*NL*
prejudice
to
her
.
Her
eyebrows
were
full
,
even
,
and
arched
beyond
the
*NL*
power
of
art
to
imitate
.
Her
black
eyes
had
a
lustre
in
them
,
which
*NL*
all
her
softness
could
not
extinguish
.
Her
nose
was
exactly
regular
,
*NL*
and
her
mouth
,
in
which
were
two
rows
of
ivory
,
exactly
answered
Sir
*NL*
John
Suckling
's
description
in
those
lines
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Her
lips
were
red
,
and
one
was
thin
,
*NL*
Compar
'd
to
that
was
next
her
chin
.
*NL*
Some
bee
had
stung
it
newly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
cheeks
were
of
the
oval
kind
;
and
in
her
right
she
had
a
dimple
,
*NL*
which
the
least
smile
discovered
.
Her
chin
had
certainly
its
share
in
*NL*
forming
the
beauty
of
her
face
;
but
it
was
difficult
to
say
it
was
*NL*
either
large
or
small
,
though
perhaps
it
was
rather
of
the
former
*NL*
kind
.
Her
complexion
had
rather
more
of
the
lily
than
of
the
rose
;
but
*NL*
when
exercise
or
modesty
increased
her
natural
colour
,
no
vermilion
*NL*
could
equal
it
.
Then
one
might
indeed
cry
out
with
the
celebrated
Dr
*NL*
Donne
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Her
pure
and
eloquent
blood
*NL*
Spoke
in
her
cheeks
,
and
so
distinctly
wrought
*NL*
That
one
might
almost
say
her
body
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
neck
was
long
and
finely
turned
:
and
here
,
if
I
was
not
afraid
of
*NL*
offending
her
delicacy
,
I
might
justly
say
,
the
highest
beauties
of
*NL*
the
famous
_
Venus
de
Medicis
_
were
outdone
.
Here
was
whiteness
which
*NL*
no
lilies
,
ivory
,
nor
alabaster
could
match
.
The
finest
cambric
might
*NL*
indeed
be
supposed
from
envy
to
cover
that
bosom
which
was
much
whiter
*NL*
than
itself
.
--
It
was
indeed
,
*NL*
*NL*
_
Nitor
splendens
Pario
marmore
purius
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gloss
shining
beyond
the
purest
brightness
of
Parian
marble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
outside
of
Sophia
;
nor
was
this
beautiful
frame
disgraced
*NL*
by
an
inhabitant
unworthy
of
it
.
Her
mind
was
every
way
equal
to
her
*NL*
person
;
nay
,
the
latter
borrowed
some
charms
from
the
former
;
for
when
*NL*
she
smiled
,
the
sweetness
of
her
temper
diffused
that
glory
over
her
*NL*
countenance
which
no
regularity
of
features
can
give
.
But
as
there
are
*NL*
no
perfections
of
the
mind
which
do
not
discover
themselves
in
that
*NL*
perfect
intimacy
to
which
we
intend
to
introduce
our
reader
with
this
*NL*
charming
young
creature
,
so
it
is
needless
to
mention
them
here
:
nay
,
*NL*
it
is
a
kind
of
tacit
affront
to
our
reader
's
understanding
,
and
may
*NL*
also
rob
him
of
that
pleasure
which
he
will
receive
in
forming
his
own
*NL*
judgment
of
her
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
,
however
,
be
proper
to
say
,
that
whatever
mental
*NL*
accomplishments
she
had
derived
from
nature
,
they
were
somewhat
*NL*
improved
and
cultivated
by
art
:
for
she
had
been
educated
under
the
*NL*
care
of
an
aunt
,
who
was
a
lady
of
great
discretion
,
and
was
*NL*
thoroughly
acquainted
with
the
world
,
having
lived
in
her
youth
about
*NL*
the
court
,
whence
she
had
retired
some
years
since
into
the
country
.
*NL*
By
her
conversation
and
instructions
,
Sophia
was
perfectly
well
bred
,
*NL*
though
perhaps
she
wanted
a
little
of
that
ease
in
her
behaviour
which
*NL*
is
to
be
acquired
only
by
habit
,
and
living
within
what
is
called
the
*NL*
polite
circle
.
But
this
,
to
say
the
truth
,
is
often
too
dearly
*NL*
purchased
;
and
though
it
hath
charms
so
inexpressible
,
that
the
*NL*
French
,
perhaps
,
among
other
qualities
,
mean
to
express
this
,
when
*NL*
they
declare
they
know
not
what
it
is
;
yet
its
absence
is
well
*NL*
compensated
by
innocence
;
nor
can
good
sense
and
a
natural
gentility
*NL*
ever
stand
in
need
of
it
.

Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wherein
the
history
goes
back
to
commemorate
a
trifling
incident
that
*NL*
happened
some
years
since
;
but
which
,
trifling
as
it
was
,
had
some
*NL*
future
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
amiable
Sophia
was
now
in
her
eighteenth
year
,
when
she
is
*NL*
introduced
into
this
history
.
Her
father
,
as
hath
been
said
,
was
*NL*
fonder
of
her
than
of
any
other
human
creature
.
To
her
,
therefore
,
Tom
*NL*
Jones
applied
,
in
order
to
engage
her
interest
on
the
behalf
of
his
*NL*
friend
the
gamekeeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
we
proceed
to
this
business
,
a
short
recapitulation
of
some
*NL*
previous
matters
may
be
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
different
tempers
of
Mr
Allworthy
and
of
Mr
Western
did
not
*NL*
admit
of
a
very
intimate
correspondence
,
yet
they
lived
upon
what
is
*NL*
called
a
decent
footing
together
;
by
which
means
the
young
people
of
*NL*
both
families
had
been
acquainted
from
their
infancy
;
and
as
they
were
*NL*
all
near
of
the
same
age
,
had
been
frequent
playmates
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gaiety
of
Tom
's
temper
suited
better
with
Sophia
,
than
the
grave
*NL*
and
sober
disposition
of
Master
Blifil
.
And
the
preference
which
she
*NL*
gave
the
former
of
these
,
would
often
appear
so
plainly
,
that
a
lad
of
*NL*
a
more
passionate
turn
than
Master
Blifil
was
,
might
have
shown
some
*NL*
displeasure
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
did
not
,
however
,
outwardly
express
any
such
disgust
,
it
would
*NL*
be
an
ill
office
in
us
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
*NL*
mind
,
as
some
scandalous
people
search
into
the
most
secret
affairs
of
*NL*
their
friends
,
and
often
pry
into
their
closets
and
cupboards
,
only
to
*NL*
discover
their
poverty
and
meanness
to
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
persons
who
suspect
they
have
given
others
cause
of
*NL*
offence
,
are
apt
to
conclude
they
are
offended
;
so
Sophia
imputed
an
*NL*
action
of
Master
Blifil
to
his
anger
,
which
the
superior
sagacity
of
*NL*
Thwackum
and
Square
discerned
to
have
arisen
from
a
much
better
*NL*
principle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Jones
,
when
very
young
,
had
presented
Sophia
with
a
little
bird
,
*NL*
which
he
had
taken
from
the
nest
,
had
nursed
up
,
and
taught
to
sing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
bird
,
Sophia
,
then
about
thirteen
years
old
,
was
so
extremely
*NL*
fond
,
that
her
chief
business
was
to
feed
and
tend
it
,
and
her
chief
*NL*
pleasure
to
play
with
it
.
By
these
means
little
Tommy
,
for
so
the
bird
*NL*
was
called
,
was
become
so
tame
,
that
it
would
feed
out
of
the
hand
of
*NL*
its
mistress
,
would
perch
upon
the
finger
,
and
lie
contented
in
her
*NL*
bosom
,
where
it
seemed
almost
sensible
of
its
own
happiness
;
though
*NL*
she
always
kept
a
small
string
about
its
leg
,
nor
would
ever
trust
it
*NL*
with
the
liberty
of
flying
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
Mr
Allworthy
and
his
whole
family
dined
at
Mr
Western
's
,
*NL*
Master
Blifil
,
being
in
the
garden
with
little
Sophia
,
and
observing
*NL*
the
extreme
fondness
that
she
showed
for
her
little
bird
,
desired
her
*NL*
to
trust
it
for
a
moment
in
his
hands
.
Sophia
presently
complied
with
*NL*
the
young
gentleman
's
request
,
and
after
some
previous
caution
,
*NL*
delivered
him
her
bird
;
of
which
he
was
no
sooner
in
possession
,
than
*NL*
he
slipt
the
string
from
its
leg
and
tossed
it
into
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
foolish
animal
no
sooner
perceived
itself
at
liberty
,
than
*NL*
forgetting
all
the
favours
it
had
received
from
Sophia
,
it
flew
*NL*
directly
from
her
,
and
perched
on
a
bough
at
some
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
seeing
her
bird
gone
,
screamed
out
so
loud
,
that
Tom
Jones
,
*NL*
who
was
at
a
little
distance
,
immediately
ran
to
her
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
no
sooner
informed
of
what
had
happened
,
than
he
cursed
Blifil
*NL*
for
a
pitiful
malicious
rascal
;
and
then
immediately
stripping
off
his
*NL*
coat
he
applied
himself
to
climbing
the
tree
to
which
the
bird
*NL*
escaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
almost
recovered
his
little
namesake
,
when
the
branch
on
which
*NL*
it
was
perched
,
and
that
hung
over
a
canal
,
broke
,
and
the
poor
lad
*NL*
plumped
over
head
and
ears
into
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
's
concern
now
changed
its
object
.
And
as
she
apprehended
the
*NL*
boy
's
life
was
in
danger
,
she
screamed
ten
times
louder
than
before
;
*NL*
and
indeed
Master
Blifil
himself
now
seconded
her
with
all
the
*NL*
vociferation
in
his
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
,
who
were
sitting
in
a
room
next
the
garden
,
were
*NL*
instantly
alarmed
,
and
came
all
forth
;
but
just
as
they
reached
the
*NL*
canal
,
Tom
-LRB-
for
the
water
was
luckily
pretty
shallow
in
that
part
-RRB-
*NL*
arrived
safely
on
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
fell
violently
on
poor
Tom
,
who
stood
dropping
and
shivering
*NL*
before
him
,
when
Mr
Allworthy
desired
him
to
have
patience
;
and
*NL*
turning
to
Master
Blifil
,
said
,
``
Pray
,
child
,
what
is
the
reason
of
*NL*
all
this
disturbance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Blifil
answered
,
``
Indeed
,
uncle
,
I
am
very
sorry
for
what
I
*NL*
have
done
;
I
have
been
unhappily
the
occasion
of
it
all
.
I
had
Miss
*NL*
Sophia
's
bird
in
my
hand
,
and
thinking
the
poor
creature
languished
*NL*
for
liberty
,
I
own
I
could
not
forbear
giving
it
what
it
desired
;
for
*NL*
I
always
thought
there
was
something
very
cruel
in
confining
anything
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
be
against
the
law
of
nature
,
by
which
everything
hath
a
*NL*
right
to
liberty
;
nay
,
it
is
even
unchristian
,
for
it
is
not
doing
*NL*
what
we
would
be
done
by
;
but
if
I
had
imagined
Miss
Sophia
would
have
*NL*
been
so
much
concerned
at
it
,
I
am
sure
I
never
would
have
done
it
;
*NL*
nay
,
if
I
had
known
what
would
have
happened
to
the
bird
itself
:
for
*NL*
when
Master
Jones
,
who
climbed
up
that
tree
after
it
,
fell
into
the
*NL*
water
,
the
bird
took
a
second
flight
,
and
presently
a
nasty
hawk
*NL*
carried
it
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Sophia
,
who
now
first
heard
of
her
little
Tommy
's
fate
-LRB-
for
her
*NL*
concern
for
Jones
had
prevented
her
perceiving
it
when
it
happened
-RRB-
,
*NL*
shed
a
shower
of
tears
.
These
Mr
Allworthy
endeavoured
to
assuage
,
*NL*
promising
her
a
much
finer
bird
:
but
she
declared
she
would
never
have
*NL*
another
.
Her
father
chid
her
for
crying
so
for
a
foolish
bird
;
but
*NL*
could
not
help
telling
young
Blifil
,
if
he
was
a
son
of
his
,
his
*NL*
backside
should
be
well
flead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
now
returned
to
her
chamber
,
the
two
young
gentlemen
were
sent
*NL*
home
,
and
the
rest
of
the
company
returned
to
their
bottle
;
where
a
*NL*
conversation
ensued
on
the
subject
of
the
bird
,
so
curious
,
that
we
*NL*
think
it
deserves
a
chapter
by
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
such
very
deep
and
grave
matters
,
that
some
readers
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
may
not
relish
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Square
had
no
sooner
lighted
his
pipe
,
than
,
addressing
himself
to
*NL*
Allworthy
,
he
thus
began
:
``
Sir
,
I
can
not
help
congratulating
you
on
*NL*
your
nephew
;
who
,
at
an
age
when
few
lads
have
any
ideas
but
of
*NL*
sensible
objects
,
is
arrived
at
a
capacity
of
distinguishing
right
*NL*
from
wrong
.
To
confine
anything
,
seems
to
me
against
the
law
of
*NL*
nature
,
by
which
everything
hath
a
right
to
liberty
.
These
were
his
*NL*
words
;
and
the
impression
they
have
made
on
me
is
never
to
be
*NL*
eradicated
.
Can
any
man
have
a
higher
notion
of
the
rule
of
right
,
and
*NL*
the
eternal
fitness
of
things
?
I
can
not
help
promising
myself
,
from
*NL*
such
a
dawn
,
that
the
meridian
of
this
youth
will
be
equal
to
that
of
*NL*
either
the
elder
or
the
younger
Brutus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Thwackum
hastily
interrupted
,
and
spilling
some
of
his
wine
,
and
*NL*
swallowing
the
rest
with
great
eagerness
,
answered
,
``
From
another
*NL*
expression
he
made
use
of
,
I
hope
he
will
resemble
much
better
men
.
*NL*
The
law
of
nature
is
a
jargon
of
words
,
which
means
nothing
.
I
know
*NL*
not
of
any
such
law
,
nor
of
any
right
which
can
be
derived
from
it
.
To
*NL*
do
as
we
would
be
done
by
,
is
indeed
a
Christian
motive
,
as
the
boy
*NL*
well
expressed
himself
;
and
I
am
glad
to
find
my
instructions
have
*NL*
borne
such
good
fruit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
vanity
was
a
thing
fit

''
says
Square
,
``
I
might
indulge
some
on
the
*NL*
same
occasion
;
for
whence
only
he
can
have
learnt
his
notions
of
right
*NL*
or
wrong
,
I
think
is
pretty
apparent
.
If
there
be
no
law
of
nature
,
*NL*
there
is
no
right
nor
wrong

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
''
says
the
parson
,
``
do
you
then
banish
revelation

Am
I
talking
*NL*
with
a
deist

an
atheist

*NL*
``

says
Western
.

Pox

I
do

you

of
you

by
right

To
take
away
my
*NL*
girl
's
bird
was
wrong
,
in
my
opinion
;
and
my
neighbour
Allworthy
may
*NL*
do
as
he
pleases
;
but
to
encourage
boys
in
such
practices
,
is
to
breed
*NL*
them
up
to
the
gallows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
answered
,
``
That
he
was
sorry
for
what
his
nephew
had
done
,
*NL*
but
could
not
consent
to
punish
him

he
acted
rather
from
a

generous
than
unworthy
motive

''
He
said
,
``
If
the
boy
had
stolen
the
*NL*
bird
,
none
would
have
been
more
ready
to
vote
for
a
severe
*NL*
chastisement
than
himself
;
but
it
was
plain
that
was
not
his
design
:
''
*NL*
and
,
indeed
,
it
was
as
apparent
to
him
,
that
he
could
have
no
other
*NL*
view
but
what
he
had
himself
avowed
.
-LRB-
For
as
to
that
malicious
purpose
*NL*
which
Sophia
suspected
,
it
never
once
entered
into
the
head
of
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
.
-RRB-
He
at
length
concluded
with
again
blaming
the
action
as
*NL*
inconsiderate
,
and
which
,
he
said
,
was
pardonable
only
in
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Square
had
delivered
his
opinion
so
openly
,
that
if
he
was
now
silent
,
*NL*
he
must
submit
to
have
his
judgment
censured
.
He
said
,
therefore
,
with
*NL*
some
warmth
,
``
That
Mr
Allworthy
had
too
much
respect
to
the
dirty

That
in
passing
our
judgments
on
great
and
*NL*
mighty
actions
,
all
private
regards
should
be
laid
aside
;
for
by
*NL*
adhering
to
those
narrow
rules
,
the
younger
Brutus
had
been
condemned
*NL*
of
ingratitude
,
and
the
elder
of
parricide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And

cried
Thwackum
,
*NL*
``
they
would
have
had
no
more
than
their

A

heathenish
villains

Heaven
be
praised
we
have
no
Brutuses
now-a-days

*NL*
I
wish
,
Mr
Square

you
would
desist
from
filling
the
minds
of
my
*NL*
pupils
with
such
antichristian

must
be
,

they
are
under
my

its
being
well
scourged
out
of
them

again

There
is
your

Tom
almost
spoiled
already

I
overheard
*NL*
him
the
other

disputing
with
Master
Blifil
that
there
was
no
merit
*NL*
in
faith
without
works

I
know
that
is
one
of
your
tenets

I
*NL*
suppose
he
had
it
from
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
accuse
me
of
spoiling
him
,
''
says
Square
.
``
Who
taught
him
to
*NL*
laugh
at
whatever
is
virtuous

decent

nature
of
things
?
He
is
your
own
scholar
,
and
I
disclaim
him
.
No

no

is
my
boy

Young
as
he
is
,
that
lad
's
notions
of
moral
*NL*
rectitude
I
defy
you
ever
to
eradicate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
put
on
a
contemptuous
sneer
at
this
,
and
replied
,
``
Ay
,
ay
,
I
*NL*
will
venture
him
with
you

He
is
too
well
grounded
for
all

philosophical
cant
to

No

no

I
have
taken
care
to
instil
such
*NL*
principles
into
him
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
instilled
principles
into
him
too
,
''
cries
Square
.
``
What
*NL*
but
the
sublime
idea
of
virtue
could
inspire
a
human
mind
with
the
*NL*
generous
thought
of
giving
liberty
?
And
I
repeat
to
you
again
,
if
it
*NL*
was
a
fit
thing
to
be
proud
,
I
might
claim
the
honour
of
having
*NL*
infused
that
idea
.
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
pride
was
not
forbidden
,
''
said
Thwackum
,
``
I
might
boast
of
*NL*
having
taught
him
that
duty
which
he
himself
assigned
as
his
motive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
between
you
both
,
''
says
the
squire
,
``
the
young
gentleman
hath
been
*NL*
taught
to
rob
my
daughter
of
her
bird
.
I
find
I
must
take
care
of
my
*NL*
partridge-mew
.
I
shall
have
some
virtuous
religious
man
or
other
set
*NL*
all
my
partridges
at
liberty
.
''
Then
slapping
a
gentleman
of
the
law
,
*NL*
who
was
present
,
on
the
back
,
he
cried
out
,
``
What
say
you
to
this
,
Mr
*NL*
Counsellor
?
Is
not
this
against
law
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
with
great
gravity
delivered
himself
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
the
case
be
put
of
a
partridge
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
but
an
*NL*
action
would
lie
;
for
though
this
be
_
ferae
naturae
_
,
yet
being
*NL*
reclaimed
,
property
vests
:
but
being
the
case
of
a
singing
bird
,
*NL*
though
reclaimed
,
as
it
is
a
thing
of
base
nature
,
it
must
be
*NL*
considered
as
_
nullius
in
bonis
_
.
In
this
case
,
therefore
,
I
conceive
*NL*
the
plaintiff
must
be
non-suited
;
and
I
should
disadvise
the
bringing
*NL*
any
such
action
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
the
squire
,
``
if
it
be
_
nullus
bonus
_
,
let
us
drink
about
,
*NL*
and
talk
a
little
of
the
state
of
the
nation
,
or
some
such
discourse
*NL*
that
we
all
understand
;
for
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
understand
a
word
of
*NL*
this
.
It
may
be
learning
and
sense
for
aught
I
know
:
but
you
shall
*NL*
never
persuade
me
into
it
.
Pox
!
you
have
neither
of
you
mentioned
a
*NL*
word
of
that
poor
lad
who
deserves
to
be
commended
:
to
venture
*NL*
breaking
his
neck
to
oblige

a
generous-spirited

''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
was
the
debate
interrupted
;
but
it
would
probably
have
been
soon
*NL*
resumed
,
had
not
Mr
Allworthy
presently
called
for
his
coach
,
and
*NL*
carried
off
the
two
combatants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
conclusion
of
this
adventure
of
the
bird
,
and
of
the
*NL*
dialogue
occasioned
by
it
;
which
we
could
not
help
recounting
to
our
*NL*
reader
,
though
it
happened
some
years
before
that
stage
or
period
of
*NL*
time
at
which
our
history
is
now
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
v.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
matter
accommodated
to
every
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parva
leves
capiunt
animos
--
Small
things
affect
light
minds
,
''
was
the
*NL*
sentiment
of
a
great
master
of
the
passion
of
love
.
And
certain
it
is
,
*NL*
that
from
this
day
Sophia
began
to
have
some
little
kindness
for
Tom
*NL*
Jones
,
and
no
little
aversion
for
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
accidents
from
time
to
time
improved
both
these
passions
in
her
*NL*
breast
;
which
,
without
our
recounting
,
the
reader
may
well
conclude
,
*NL*
from
what
we
have
before
hinted
of
the
different
tempers
of
these
*NL*
lads
,
and
how
much
the
one
suited
with
her
own
inclinations
more
than
*NL*
the
other
.
To
say
the
truth
,
Sophia
,
when
very
young
,
discerned
that
*NL*
Tom
,
though
an
idle
,
thoughtless
,
rattling
rascal
,
was
nobody
's
enemy
*NL*
but
his
own
;
and
that
Master
Blifil
,
though
a
prudent
,
discreet
,
sober
*NL*
young
gentleman
,
was
at
the
same
time
strongly
attached
to
the
*NL*
interest
only
of
one
single
person
;
and
who
that
single
person
was
the
*NL*
reader
will
be
able
to
divine
without
any
assistance
of
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
characters
are
not
always
received
in
the
world
with
the
*NL*
different
regard
which
seems
severally
due
to
either
;
and
which
one
*NL*
would
imagine
mankind
,
from
self-interest
,
should
show
towards
them
.
*NL*
But
perhaps
there
may
be
a
political
reason
for
it
:
in
finding
one
of
*NL*
a
truly
benevolent
disposition
,
men
may
very
reasonably
suppose
they
*NL*
have
found
a
treasure
,
and
be
desirous
of
keeping
it
,
like
all
other
*NL*
good
things
,
to
themselves
.
Hence
they
may
imagine
,
that
to
trumpet
*NL*
forth
the
praises
of
such
a
person
,
would
,
in
the
vulgar
phrase
,
be
*NL*
crying
Roast-meat
,
and
calling
in
partakers
of
what
they
intend
to
*NL*
apply
solely
to
their
own
use
.
If
this
reason
does
not
satisfy
the
*NL*
reader
,
I
know
no
other
means
of
accounting
for
the
little
respect
*NL*
which
I
have
commonly
seen
paid
to
a
character
which
really
does
great
*NL*
honour
to
human
nature
,
and
is
productive
of
the
highest
good
to
*NL*
society
.
But
it
was
otherwise
with
Sophia
.
She
honoured
Tom
Jones
,
and
*NL*
scorned
Master
Blifil
,
almost
as
soon
as
she
knew
the
meaning
of
those
*NL*
two
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
had
been
absent
upwards
of
three
years
with
her
aunt
;
during
*NL*
all
which
time
she
had
seldom
seen
either
of
these
young
gentlemen
.
*NL*
She
dined
,
however
,
once
,
together
with
her
aunt
,
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
.
*NL*
This
was
a
few
days
after
the
adventure
of
the
partridge
,
before
*NL*
commemorated
.
Sophia
heard
the
whole
story
at
table
,
where
she
said
*NL*
nothing
:
nor
indeed
could
her
aunt
get
many
words
from
her
as
she
*NL*
returned
home
;
but
her
maid
,
when
undressing
her
,
happening
to
say
,
*NL*
``
Well
,
miss
,
I
suppose
you
have
seen
young
Master
Blifil
to-day
?
''
she
*NL*
answered
with
much
passion
,
``
I
hate
the
name
of
Master
Blifil
,
as
I
do
*NL*
whatever
is
base
and
treacherous
:
and
I
wonder
Mr
Allworthy
would
*NL*
suffer
that
old
barbarous
schoolmaster
to
punish
a
poor
boy
so
cruelly
*NL*
for
what
was
only
the
effect
of
his
good-nature
.
''
She
then
recounted
*NL*
the
story
to
her
maid
,
and
concluded
with
saying
,
``
Do
n't
you
think
he
*NL*
is
a
boy
of
noble
spirit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
young
lady
was
now
returned
to
her
father
;
who
gave
her
the
*NL*
command
of
his
house
,
and
placed
her
at
the
upper
end
of
his
table
,
*NL*
where
Tom
-LRB-
who
for
his
great
love
of
hunting
was
become
a
great
*NL*
favourite
of
the
squire
-RRB-
often
dined
.
Young
men
of
open
,
generous
*NL*
dispositions
are
naturally
inclined
to
gallantry
,
which
,
if
they
have
*NL*
good
understandings
,
as
was
in
reality
Tom
's
case
,
exerts
itself
in
an
*NL*
obliging
complacent
behaviour
to
all
women
in
general
.
This
greatly
*NL*
distinguished
Tom
from
the
boisterous
brutality
of
mere
country
*NL*
squires
on
the
one
hand
,
and
from
the
solemn
and
somewhat
sullen
*NL*
deportment
of
Master
Blifil
on
the
other
;
and
he
began
now
,
at
twenty
,
*NL*
to
have
the
name
of
a
pretty
fellow
among
all
the
women
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
behaved
to
Sophia
with
no
particularity
,
unless
perhaps
by
showing
*NL*
her
a
higher
respect
than
he
paid
to
any
other
.
This
distinction
her
*NL*
beauty
,
fortune
,
sense
,
and
amiable
carriage
,
seemed
to
demand
;
but
as
*NL*
to
design
upon
her
person
he
had
none
;
for
which
we
shall
at
present
*NL*
suffer
the
reader
to
condemn
him
of
stupidity
;
but
perhaps
we
shall
be
*NL*
able
indifferently
well
to
account
for
it
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
with
the
highest
degree
of
innocence
and
modesty
,
had
a
*NL*
remarkable
sprightliness
in
her
temper
.
This
was
so
greatly
increased
*NL*
whenever
she
was
in
company
with
Tom
,
that
had
he
not
been
very
young
*NL*
and
thoughtless
,
he
must
have
observed
it
:
or
had
not
Mr
Western
's
*NL*
thoughts
been
generally
either
in
the
field
,
the
stable
,
or
the
*NL*
dog-kennel
,
it
might
have
perhaps
created
some
jealousy
in
him
:
but
so
*NL*
far
was
the
good
gentleman
from
entertaining
any
such
suspicions
,
that
*NL*
he
gave
Tom
every
opportunity
with
his
daughter
which
any
lover
could
*NL*
have
wished
;
and
this
Tom
innocently
improved
to
better
advantage
,
by
*NL*
following
only
the
dictates
of
his
natural
gallantry
and
good-nature
,
*NL*
than
he
might
perhaps
have
done
had
he
had
the
deepest
designs
on
the
*NL*
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
indeed
it
can
occasion
little
wonder
that
this
matter
escaped
the
*NL*
observation
of
others
,
since
poor
Sophia
herself
never
remarked
it
;
*NL*
and
her
heart
was
irretrievably
lost
before
she
suspected
it
was
in
*NL*
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matters
were
in
this
situation
,
when
Tom
,
one
afternoon
,
finding
*NL*
Sophia
alone
,
began
,
after
a
short
apology
,
with
a
very
serious
face
,
*NL*
to
acquaint
her
that
he
had
a
favour
to
ask
of
her
which
he
hoped
her
*NL*
goodness
would
comply
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
neither
the
young
man
's
behaviour
,
nor
indeed
his
manner
of
*NL*
opening
this
business
,
were
such
as
could
give
her
any
just
cause
of
*NL*
suspecting
he
intended
to
make
love
to
her
;
yet
whether
Nature
*NL*
whispered
something
into
her
ear
,
or
from
what
cause
it
arose
I
will
*NL*
not
determine
;
certain
it
is
,
some
idea
of
that
kind
must
have
*NL*
intruded
itself
;
for
her
colour
forsook
her
cheeks
,
her
limbs
*NL*
trembled
,
and
her
tongue
would
have
faltered
,
had
Tom
stopped
for
an
*NL*
answer
;
but
he
soon
relieved
her
from
her
perplexity
,
by
proceeding
to
*NL*
inform
her
of
his
request
;
which
was
to
solicit
her
interest
on
behalf
*NL*
of
the
gamekeeper
,
whose
own
ruin
,
and
that
of
a
large
family
,
must
*NL*
be
,
he
said
,
the
consequence
of
Mr
Western
's
pursuing
his
action
*NL*
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
presently
recovered
her
confusion
,
and
,
with
a
smile
full
of
*NL*
sweetness
,
said
,
``
Is
this
the
mighty
favour
you
asked
with
so
much
*NL*
gravity
?
I
will
do
it
with
all
my
heart
.
I
really
pity
the
poor
*NL*
fellow
,
and
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
sent
a
small
matter
to
his
*NL*
wife
.
''
This
small
matter
was
one
of
her
gowns
,
some
linen
,
and
ten
*NL*
shillings
in
money
,
of
which
Tom
had
heard
,
and
it
had
,
in
reality
,
*NL*
put
this
solicitation
into
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
youth
,
now
,
emboldened
with
his
success
,
resolved
to
push
the
*NL*
matter
farther
,
and
ventured
even
to
beg
her
recommendation
of
him
to
*NL*
her
father
's
service
;
protesting
that
he
thought
him
one
of
the
*NL*
honestest
fellows
in
the
country
,
and
extremely
well
qualified
for
the
*NL*
place
of
a
gamekeeper
,
which
luckily
then
happened
to
be
vacant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
answered
,
``
Well
,
I
will
undertake
this
too
;
but
I
can
not
*NL*
promise
you
as
much
success
as
in
the
former
part
,
which
I
assure
you
*NL*
I
will
not
quit
my
father
without
obtaining
.
However
,
I
will
do
what
I
*NL*
can
for
the
poor
fellow
;
for
I
sincerely
look
upon
him
and
his
family
*NL*
as
objects
of
great
compassion
.
And
now
,
Mr
Jones
,
I
must
ask
you
a
*NL*
favour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
favour
,
madam
!
''
cries
Tom
:
``
if
you
knew
the
pleasure
you
have
given
*NL*
me
in
the
hopes
of
receiving
a
command
from
you
,
you
would
think
by
*NL*
mentioning
it
you
did
confer
the
greatest
favour
on
me
;
for
by
this
*NL*
dear
hand
I
would
sacrifice
my
life
to
oblige
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
snatched
her
hand
,
and
eagerly
kissed
it
,
which
was
the
first
*NL*
time
his
lips
had
ever
touched
her
.
The
blood
,
which
before
had
*NL*
forsaken
her
cheeks
,
now
made
her
sufficient
amends
,
by
rushing
all
*NL*
over
her
face
and
neck
with
such
violence
,
that
they
became
all
of
a
*NL*
scarlet
colour
.
She
now
first
felt
a
sensation
to
which
she
had
been
*NL*
before
a
stranger
,
and
which
,
when
she
had
leisure
to
reflect
on
it
,
*NL*
began
to
acquaint
her
with
some
secrets
,
which
the
reader
,
if
he
doth
*NL*
not
already
guess
them
,
will
know
in
due
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
-LRB-
which
was
not
instantly
-RRB-
,
informed
*NL*
him
that
the
favour
she
had
to
desire
of
him
was
,
not
to
lead
her
*NL*
father
through
so
many
dangers
in
hunting
;
for
that
,
from
what
she
had
*NL*
heard
,
she
was
terribly
frightened
every
time
they
went
out
together
,
*NL*
and
expected
some
day
or
other
to
see
her
father
brought
home
with
*NL*
broken
limbs
.
She
therefore
begged
him
,
for
her
sake
,
to
be
more
*NL*
cautious
;
and
as
he
well
knew
Mr
Western
would
follow
him
,
not
to
ride
*NL*
so
madly
,
nor
to
take
those
dangerous
leaps
for
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
promised
faithfully
to
obey
her
commands
;
and
after
thanking
her
*NL*
for
her
kind
compliance
with
his
request
,
took
his
leave
,
and
departed
*NL*
highly
charmed
with
his
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Sophia
was
charmed
too
,
but
in
a
very
different
way
.
Her
*NL*
sensations
,
however
,
the
reader
's
heart
-LRB-
if
he
or
she
have
any
-RRB-
will
*NL*
better
represent
than
I
can
,
if
I
had
as
many
mouths
as
ever
poet
*NL*
wished
for
,
to
eat
,
I
suppose
,
those
many
dainties
with
which
he
was
*NL*
so
plentifully
provided
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Mr
Western
's
custom
every
afternoon
,
as
soon
as
he
was
drunk
,
*NL*
to
hear
his
daughter
play
on
the
harpsichord
;
for
he
was
a
great
lover
*NL*
of
music
,
and
perhaps
,
had
he
lived
in
town
,
might
have
passed
for
a
*NL*
connoisseur
;
for
he
always
excepted
against
the
finest
compositions
of
*NL*
Mr
Handel
.
He
never
relished
any
music
but
what
was
light
and
airy
;
*NL*
and
indeed
his
most
favourite
tunes
were
Old
Sir
Simon
the
King
,
St
*NL*
George
he
was
for
England
,
Bobbing
Joan
,
and
some
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
daughter
,
though
she
was
a
perfect
mistress
of
music
,
and
would
*NL*
never
willingly
have
played
any
but
Handel
's
,
was
so
devoted
to
her
*NL*
father
's
pleasure
,
that
she
learnt
all
those
tunes
to
oblige
him
.
*NL*
However
,
she
would
now
and
then
endeavour
to
lead
him
into
her
own
*NL*
taste
;
and
when
he
required
the
repetition
of
his
ballads
,
would
*NL*
answer
with
a
``
Nay
,
dear
sir
;
''
and
would
often
beg
him
to
suffer
her
*NL*
to
play
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
evening
,
however
,
when
the
gentleman
was
retired
from
his
bottle
,
*NL*
she
played
all
his
favourites
three
times
over
without
any
*NL*
solicitation
.
This
so
pleased
the
good
squire
,
that
he
started
from
*NL*
his
couch
,
gave
his
daughter
a
kiss
,
and
swore
her
hand
was
greatly
*NL*
improved
.
She
took
this
opportunity
to
execute
her
promise
to
Tom
;
in
*NL*
which
she
succeeded
so
well
,
that
the
squire
declared
,
if
she
would
*NL*
give
him
t
`
other
bout
of
Old
Sir
Simon
,
he
would
give
the
gamekeeper
*NL*
his
deputation
the
next
morning
.
Sir
Simon
was
played
again
and
again
,
*NL*
till
the
charms
of
the
music
soothed
Mr
Western
to
sleep
.
In
the
*NL*
morning
Sophia
did
not
fail
to
remind
him
of
his
engagement
;
and
his
*NL*
attorney
was
immediately
sent
for
,
ordered
to
stop
any
further
*NL*
proceedings
in
the
action
,
and
to
make
out
the
deputation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
success
in
this
affair
soon
began
to
ring
over
the
country
,
and
*NL*
various
were
the
censures
passed
upon
it
;
some
greatly
applauding
it
*NL*
as
an
act
of
good
nature
;
others
sneering
,
and
saying
,
``
No
wonder
that
*NL*
one
idle
fellow
should
love
another
.
''
Young
Blifil
was
greatly
enraged
*NL*
at
it
.
He
had
long
hated
Black
George
in
the
same
proportion
as
Jones
*NL*
delighted
in
him
;
not
from
any
offence
which
he
had
ever
received
,
but
*NL*
from
his
great
love
to
religion
and
virtue
;
--
for
Black
George
had
the
*NL*
reputation
of
a
loose
kind
of
a
fellow
.
Blifil
therefore
represented
*NL*
this
as
flying
in
Mr
Allworthy
's
face
;
and
declared
,
with
great
*NL*
concern
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
find
any
other
motive
for
doing
*NL*
good
to
such
a
wretch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
and
Square
likewise
sung
to
the
same
tune
.
They
were
now
*NL*
-LRB-
especially
the
latter
-RRB-
become
greatly
jealous
of
young
Jones
with
the
*NL*
widow
;
for
he
now
approached
the
age
of
twenty
,
was
really
a
fine
*NL*
young
fellow
,
and
that
lady
,
by
her
encouragements
to
him
,
seemed
*NL*
daily
more
and
more
to
think
him
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
was
not
,
however
,
moved
with
their
malice
.
He
declared
*NL*
himself
very
well
satisfied
with
what
Jones
had
done
.
He
said
the
*NL*
perseverance
and
integrity
of
his
friendship
was
highly
commendable
,
*NL*
and
he
wished
he
could
see
more
frequent
instances
of
that
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fortune
,
who
seldom
greatly
relishes
such
sparks
as
my
friend
Tom
,
*NL*
perhaps
because
they
do
not
pay
more
ardent
addresses
to
her
,
gave
now
*NL*
a
very
different
turn
to
all
his
actions
,
and
showed
them
to
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
in
a
light
far
less
agreeable
than
that
gentleman
's
goodness
*NL*
had
hitherto
seen
them
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
apology
for
the
insensibility
of
Mr
Jones
to
all
the
charms
of
the
*NL*
lovely
Sophia
;
in
which
possibly
we
may
,
in
a
considerable
degree
,
*NL*
lower
his
character
in
the
estimation
of
those
men
of
wit
and
*NL*
gallantry
who
approve
the
heroes
in
most
of
our
modern
comedies
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
two
sorts
of
people
,
who
,
I
am
afraid
,
have
already
*NL*
conceived
some
contempt
for
my
heroe
,
on
account
of
his
behaviour
to
*NL*
Sophia
.
The
former
of
these
will
blame
his
prudence
in
neglecting
an
*NL*
opportunity
to
possess
himself
of
Mr
Western
's
fortune
;
and
the
latter
*NL*
will
no
less
despise
him
for
his
backwardness
to
so
fine
a
girl
,
who
*NL*
seemed
ready
to
fly
into
his
arms
,
if
he
would
open
them
to
receive
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
though
I
shall
not
perhaps
be
able
absolutely
to
acquit
him
of
*NL*
either
of
these
charges
-LRB-
for
want
of
prudence
admits
of
no
excuse
;
and
*NL*
what
I
shall
produce
against
the
latter
charge
will
,
I
apprehend
,
be
*NL*
scarce
satisfactory
-RRB-
;
yet
,
as
evidence
may
sometimes
be
offered
in
*NL*
mitigation
,
I
shall
set
forth
the
plain
matter
of
fact
,
and
leave
the
*NL*
whole
to
the
reader
's
determination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
had
somewhat
about
him
,
which
,
though
I
think
writers
are
not
*NL*
thoroughly
agreed
in
its
name
,
doth
certainly
inhabit
some
human
*NL*
breasts
;
whose
use
is
not
so
properly
to
distinguish
right
from
wrong
,
*NL*
as
to
prompt
and
incite
them
to
the
former
,
and
to
restrain
and
*NL*
withhold
them
from
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
somewhat
may
be
indeed
resembled
to
the
famous
trunk-maker
in
the
*NL*
playhouse
;
for
,
whenever
the
person
who
is
possessed
of
it
doth
what
*NL*
is
right
,
no
ravished
or
friendly
spectator
is
so
eager
or
so
loud
in
*NL*
his
applause
:
on
the
contrary
,
when
he
doth
wrong
,
no
critic
is
so
apt
*NL*
to
hiss
and
explode
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
give
a
higher
idea
of
the
principle
I
mean
,
as
well
as
one
more
*NL*
familiar
to
the
present
age
;
it
may
be
considered
as
sitting
on
its
*NL*
throne
in
the
mind
,
like
the
Lord
High
Chancellor
of
this
kingdom
in
*NL*
his
court
;
where
it
presides
,
governs
,
directs
,
judges
,
acquits
,
and
*NL*
condemns
according
to
merit
and
justice
,
with
a
knowledge
which
*NL*
nothing
escapes
,
a
penetration
which
nothing
can
deceive
,
and
an
*NL*
integrity
which
nothing
can
corrupt
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
active
principle
may
perhaps
be
said
to
constitute
the
most
*NL*
essential
barrier
between
us
and
our
neighbours
the
brutes
;
for
if
*NL*
there
be
some
in
the
human
shape
who
are
not
under
any
such
dominion
,
*NL*
I
choose
rather
to
consider
them
as
deserters
from
us
to
our
*NL*
neighbours
;
among
whom
they
will
have
the
fate
of
deserters
,
and
not
*NL*
be
placed
in
the
first
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
heroe
,
whether
he
derived
it
from
Thwackum
or
Square
I
will
not
*NL*
determine
,
was
very
strongly
under
the
guidance
of
this
principle
;
for
*NL*
though
he
did
not
always
act
rightly
,
yet
he
never
did
otherwise
*NL*
without
feeling
and
suffering
for
it
.
It
was
this
which
taught
him
,
*NL*
that
to
repay
the
civilities
and
little
friendships
of
hospitality
by
*NL*
robbing
the
house
where
you
have
received
them
,
is
to
be
the
basest
*NL*
and
meanest
of
thieves
.
He
did
not
think
the
baseness
of
this
offence
*NL*
lessened
by
the
height
of
the
injury
committed
;
on
the
contrary
,
if
to
*NL*
steal
another
's
plate
deserved
death
and
infamy
,
it
seemed
to
him
*NL*
difficult
to
assign
a
punishment
adequate
to
the
robbing
a
man
of
his
*NL*
whole
fortune
,
and
of
his
child
into
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
principle
,
therefore
,
prevented
him
from
any
thought
of
making
*NL*
his
fortune
by
such
means
-LRB-
for
this
,
as
I
have
said
,
is
an
active
*NL*
principle
,
and
doth
not
content
itself
with
knowledge
or
belief
only
-RRB-
.
*NL*
Had
he
been
greatly
enamoured
of
Sophia
,
he
possibly
might
have
*NL*
thought
otherwise
;
but
give
me
leave
to
say
,
there
is
great
difference
*NL*
between
running
away
with
a
man
's
daughter
from
the
motive
of
love
,
*NL*
and
doing
the
same
thing
from
the
motive
of
theft
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
though
this
young
gentleman
was
not
insensible
of
the
charms
of
*NL*
Sophia
;
though
he
greatly
liked
her
beauty
,
and
esteemed
all
her
other
*NL*
qualifications
,
she
had
made
,
however
,
no
deep
impression
on
his
*NL*
heart
;
for
which
,
as
it
renders
him
liable
to
the
charge
of
stupidity
,
*NL*
or
at
least
of
want
of
taste
,
we
shall
now
proceed
to
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
then
is
,
his
heart
was
in
the
possession
of
another
woman
.
*NL*
Here
I
question
not
but
the
reader
will
be
surprized
at
our
long
*NL*
taciturnity
as
to
this
matter
;
and
quite
at
a
loss
to
divine
who
this
*NL*
woman
was
,
since
we
have
hitherto
not
dropt
a
hint
of
any
one
likely
*NL*
to
be
a
rival
to
Sophia
;
for
as
to
Mrs
Blifil
,
though
we
have
been
*NL*
obliged
to
mention
some
suspicions
of
her
affection
for
Tom
,
we
have
*NL*
not
hitherto
given
the
least
latitude
for
imagining
that
he
had
any
*NL*
for
her
;
and
,
indeed
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
it
,
but
the
youth
of
both
*NL*
sexes
are
too
apt
to
be
deficient
in
their
gratitude
for
that
regard
*NL*
with
which
persons
more
advanced
in
years
are
sometimes
so
kind
to
*NL*
honour
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
reader
may
be
no
longer
in
suspense
,
he
will
be
pleased
to
*NL*
remember
,
that
we
have
often
mentioned
the
family
of
George
Seagrim
*NL*
-LRB-
commonly
called
Black
George
,
the
gamekeeper
-RRB-
,
which
consisted
at
*NL*
present
of
a
wife
and
five
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
of
these
children
was
a
daughter
,
whose
name
was
Molly
,
and
*NL*
who
was
esteemed
one
of
the
handsomest
girls
in
the
whole
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Congreve
well
says
there
is
in
true
beauty
something
which
vulgar
*NL*
souls
can
not
admire
;
so
can
no
dirt
or
rags
hide
this
something
from
*NL*
those
souls
which
are
not
of
the
vulgar
stamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beauty
of
this
girl
made
,
however
,
no
impression
on
Tom
,
till
she
*NL*
grew
towards
the
age
of
sixteen
,
when
Tom
,
who
was
near
three
years
*NL*
older
,
began
first
to
cast
the
eyes
of
affection
upon
her
.
And
this
*NL*
affection
he
had
fixed
on
the
girl
long
before
he
could
bring
himself
*NL*
to
attempt
the
possession
of
her
person
:
for
though
his
constitution
*NL*
urged
him
greatly
to
this
,
his
principles
no
less
forcibly
restrained
*NL*
him
.
To
debauch
a
young
woman
,
however
low
her
condition
was
,
appeared
*NL*
to
him
a
very
heinous
crime
;
and
the
good-will
he
bore
the
father
,
*NL*
with
the
compassion
he
had
for
his
family
,
very
strongly
corroborated
*NL*
all
such
sober
reflections
;
so
that
he
once
resolved
to
get
the
better
*NL*
of
his
inclinations
,
and
he
actually
abstained
three
whole
months
*NL*
without
ever
going
to
Seagrim
's
house
,
or
seeing
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
though
Molly
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
generally
thought
a
very
fine
*NL*
girl
,
and
in
reality
she
was
so
,
yet
her
beauty
was
not
of
the
most
*NL*
amiable
kind
.
It
had
,
indeed
,
very
little
of
feminine
in
it
,
and
would
*NL*
have
become
a
man
at
least
as
well
as
a
woman
;
for
,
to
say
the
truth
,
*NL*
youth
and
florid
health
had
a
very
considerable
share
in
the
*NL*
composition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
her
mind
more
effeminate
than
her
person
.
As
this
was
tall
and
*NL*
robust
,
so
was
that
bold
and
forward
.
So
little
had
she
of
modesty
,
*NL*
that
Jones
had
more
regard
for
her
virtue
than
she
herself
.
And
as
*NL*
most
probably
she
liked
Tom
as
well
as
he
liked
her
,
so
when
she
*NL*
perceived
his
backwardness
she
herself
grew
proportionably
forward
;
*NL*
and
when
she
saw
he
had
entirely
deserted
the
house
,
she
found
means
*NL*
of
throwing
herself
in
his
way
,
and
behaved
in
such
a
manner
that
the
*NL*
youth
must
have
had
very
much
or
very
little
of
the
heroe
if
her
*NL*
endeavours
had
proved
unsuccessful
.
In
a
word
,
she
soon
triumphed
over
*NL*
all
the
virtuous
resolutions
of
Jones
;
for
though
she
behaved
at
last
*NL*
with
all
decent
reluctance
,
yet
I
rather
chuse
to
attribute
the
*NL*
triumph
to
her
,
since
,
in
fact
,
it
was
her
design
which
succeeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
conduct
of
this
matter
,
I
say
,
Molly
so
well
played
her
part
,
*NL*
that
Jones
attributed
the
conquest
entirely
to
himself
,
and
considered
*NL*
the
young
woman
as
one
who
had
yielded
to
the
violent
attacks
of
his
*NL*
passion
.
He
likewise
imputed
her
yielding
to
the
ungovernable
force
of
*NL*
her
love
towards
him
;
and
this
the
reader
will
allow
to
have
been
a
*NL*
very
natural
and
probable
supposition
,
as
we
have
more
than
once
*NL*
mentioned
the
uncommon
comeliness
of
his
person
:
and
,
indeed
,
he
was
*NL*
one
of
the
handsomest
young
fellows
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
there
are
some
minds
whose
affections
,
like
Master
Blifil
's
,
are
*NL*
solely
placed
on
one
single
person
,
whose
interest
and
indulgence
*NL*
alone
they
consider
on
every
occasion
;
regarding
the
good
and
ill
of
*NL*
all
others
as
merely
indifferent
,
any
farther
than
as
they
contribute
*NL*
to
the
pleasure
or
advantage
of
that
person
:
so
there
is
a
different
*NL*
temper
of
mind
which
borrows
a
degree
of
virtue
even
from
self-love
.
*NL*
Such
can
never
receive
any
kind
of
satisfaction
from
another
,
without
*NL*
loving
the
creature
to
whom
that
satisfaction
is
owing
,
and
without
*NL*
making
its
well-being
in
some
sort
necessary
to
their
own
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
latter
species
was
our
heroe
.
He
considered
this
poor
girl
as
*NL*
one
whose
happiness
or
misery
he
had
caused
to
be
dependent
on
*NL*
himself
.
Her
beauty
was
still
the
object
of
desire
,
though
greater
*NL*
beauty
,
or
a
fresher
object
,
might
have
been
more
so
;
but
the
little
*NL*
abatement
which
fruition
had
occasioned
to
this
was
highly
*NL*
overbalanced
by
the
considerations
of
the
affection
which
she
visibly
*NL*
bore
him
,
and
of
the
situation
into
which
he
had
brought
her
.
The
*NL*
former
of
these
created
gratitude
,
the
latter
compassion
;
and
both
,
*NL*
together
with
his
desire
for
her
person
,
raised
in
him
a
passion
which
*NL*
might
,
without
any
great
violence
to
the
word
,
be
called
love
;
though
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
it
was
at
first
not
very
judiciously
placed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
then
,
was
the
true
reason
of
that
insensibility
which
he
had
*NL*
shown
to
the
charms
of
Sophia
,
and
that
behaviour
in
her
which
might
*NL*
have
been
reasonably
enough
interpreted
as
an
encouragement
to
his
*NL*
addresses
;
for
as
he
could
not
think
of
abandoning
his
Molly
,
poor
and
*NL*
destitute
as
she
was
,
so
no
more
could
he
entertain
a
notion
of
*NL*
betraying
such
a
creature
as
Sophia
.
And
surely
,
had
he
given
the
*NL*
least
encouragement
to
any
passion
for
that
young
lady
,
he
must
have
*NL*
been
absolutely
guilty
of
one
or
other
of
those
crimes
;
either
of
*NL*
which
would
,
in
my
opinion
,
have
very
justly
subjected
him
to
that
*NL*
fate
,
which
,
at
his
first
introduction
into
this
history
,
I
mentioned
*NL*
to
have
been
generally
predicted
as
his
certain
destiny
.

Chapter

Being
the
shortest
chapter
in
this
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mother
first
perceived
the
alteration
in
the
shape
of
Molly
;
and
*NL*
in
order
to
hide
it
from
her
neighbours
,
she
foolishly
clothed
her
in
*NL*
that
sack
which
Sophia
had
sent
her
;
though
,
indeed
,
that
young
lady
*NL*
had
little
apprehension
that
the
poor
woman
would
have
been
weak
*NL*
enough
to
let
any
of
her
daughters
wear
it
in
that
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Molly
was
charmed
with
the
first
opportunity
she
ever
had
of
showing
*NL*
her
beauty
to
advantage
;
for
though
she
could
very
well
bear
to
*NL*
contemplate
herself
in
the
glass
,
even
when
dressed
in
rags
;
and
*NL*
though
she
had
in
that
dress
conquered
the
heart
of
Jones
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
of
some
others
;
yet
she
thought
the
addition
of
finery
would
much
*NL*
improve
her
charms
,
and
extend
her
conquests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Molly
,
therefore
,
having
dressed
herself
out
in
this
sack
,
with
a
new
*NL*
laced
cap
,
and
some
other
ornaments
which
Tom
had
given
her
,
repairs
*NL*
to
church
with
her
fan
in
her
hand
the
very
next
Sunday
.
The
great
are
*NL*
deceived
if
they
imagine
they
have
appropriated
ambition
and
vanity
to
*NL*
themselves
.
These
noble
qualities
flourish
as
notably
in
a
country
*NL*
church
and
churchyard
as
in
the
drawing-room
,
or
in
the
closet
.
*NL*
Schemes
have
indeed
been
laid
in
the
vestry
which
would
hardly
*NL*
disgrace
the
conclave
.
Here
is
a
ministry
,
and
here
is
an
opposition
.
*NL*
Here
are
plots
and
circumventions
,
parties
and
factions
,
equal
to
*NL*
those
which
are
to
be
found
in
courts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
are
the
women
here
less
practised
in
the
highest
feminine
arts
*NL*
than
their
fair
superiors
in
quality
and
fortune
.
Here
are
prudes
and
*NL*
coquettes
.
Here
are
dressing
and
ogling
,
falsehood
,
envy
,
malice
,
*NL*
scandal
;
in
short
,
everything
which
is
common
to
the
most
splendid
*NL*
assembly
,
or
politest
circle
.
Let
those
of
high
life
,
therefore
,
no
*NL*
longer
despise
the
ignorance
of
their
inferiors
;
nor
the
vulgar
any
*NL*
longer
rail
at
the
vices
of
their
betters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Molly
had
seated
herself
some
time
before
she
was
known
by
her
*NL*
neighbours
.
And
then
a
whisper
ran
through
the
whole
congregation
,
*NL*
``
Who
is
she
?
''
but
when
she
was
discovered
,
such
sneering
,
gigling
,
*NL*
tittering
,
and
laughing
ensued
among
the
women
,
that
Mr
Allworthy
was
*NL*
obliged
to
exert
his
authority
to
preserve
any
decency
among
them
.

*NL*
A
battle
sung
by
the
muse
in
the
Homerican
style
,
and
which
none
but
*NL*
the
classical
reader
can
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
had
an
estate
in
this
parish
;
and
as
his
house
stood
at
*NL*
little
greater
distance
from
this
church
than
from
his
own
,
he
very
*NL*
often
came
to
Divine
Service
here
;
and
both
he
and
the
charming
Sophia
*NL*
happened
to
be
present
at
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
was
much
pleased
with
the
beauty
of
the
girl
,
whom
she
pitied
*NL*
for
her
simplicity
in
having
dressed
herself
in
that
manner
,
as
she
*NL*
saw
the
envy
which
it
had
occasioned
among
her
equals
.
She
no
sooner
*NL*
came
home
than
she
sent
for
the
gamekeeper
,
and
ordered
him
to
bring
*NL*
his
daughter
to
her
;
saying
she
would
provide
for
her
in
the
family
,
*NL*
and
might
possibly
place
the
girl
about
her
own
person
,
when
her
own
*NL*
maid
,
who
was
now
going
away
,
had
left
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Seagrim
was
thunderstruck
at
this
;
for
he
was
no
stranger
to
the
*NL*
fault
in
the
shape
of
his
daughter
.
He
answered
,
in
a
stammering
*NL*
voice
,
``
That
he
was
afraid
Molly
would
be
too
awkward
to
wait
on
her
*NL*
ladyship
,
as
she
had
never
been
at
service
.
''
``
No
matter
for
that
,
''
*NL*
says
Sophia
;
``
she
will
soon
improve
.
I
am
pleased
with
the
girl
,
and
*NL*
am
resolved
to
try
her
.

*NL*
Black
George
now
repaired
to
his
wife
,
on
whose
prudent
counsel
he
*NL*
depended
to
extricate
him
out
of
this
dilemma
;
but
when
he
came
*NL*
thither
he
found
his
house
in
some
confusion
.
So
great
envy
had
this
*NL*
sack
occasioned
,
that
when
Mr
Allworthy
and
the
other
gentry
were
gone
*NL*
from
church
,
the
rage
,
which
had
hitherto
been
confined
,
burst
into
an
*NL*
uproar
;
and
,
having
vented
itself
at
first
in
opprobrious
words
,
*NL*
laughs
,
hisses
,
and
gestures
,
betook
itself
at
last
to
certain
missile
*NL*
weapons
;
which
,
though
from
their
plastic
nature
they
threatened
*NL*
neither
the
loss
of
life
or
of
limb
,
were
however
sufficiently
*NL*
dreadful
to
a
well-dressed
lady
.
Molly
had
too
much
spirit
to
bear
*NL*
this
treatment
tamely
.
Having
therefore
--
but
hold
,
as
we
are
diffident
*NL*
of
our
own
abilities
,
let
us
here
invite
a
superior
power
to
our
*NL*
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ye
Muses
,
then
,
whoever
ye
are
,
who
love
to
sing
battles
,
and
*NL*
principally
thou
who
whilom
didst
recount
the
slaughter
in
those
*NL*
fields
where
Hudibras
and
Trulla
fought
,
if
thou
wert
not
starved
with
*NL*
thy
friend
Butler
,
assist
me
on
this
great
occasion
.
All
things
are
*NL*
not
in
the
power
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
vast
herd
of
cows
in
a
rich
farmer
's
yard
,
if
,
while
they
are
*NL*
milked
,
they
hear
their
calves
at
a
distance
,
lamenting
the
robbery
*NL*
which
is
then
committing
,
roar
and
bellow
;
so
roared
forth
the
*NL*
Somersetshire
mob
an
hallaloo
,
made
up
of
almost
as
many
squalls
,
*NL*
screams
,
and
other
different
sounds
as
there
were
persons
,
or
indeed
*NL*
passions
among
them
:
some
were
inspired
by
rage
,
others
alarmed
by
*NL*
fear
,
and
others
had
nothing
in
their
heads
but
the
love
of
fun
;
but
*NL*
chiefly
Envy
,
the
sister
of
Satan
,
and
his
constant
companion
,
rushed
*NL*
among
the
crowd
,
and
blew
up
the
fury
of
the
women
;
who
no
sooner
came
*NL*
up
to
Molly
than
they
pelted
her
with
dirt
and
rubbish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Molly
,
having
endeavoured
in
vain
to
make
a
handsome
retreat
,
faced
*NL*
about
;
and
laying
hold
of
ragged
Bess
,
who
advanced
in
the
front
of
*NL*
the
enemy
,
she
at
one
blow
felled
her
to
the
ground
.
The
whole
army
of
*NL*
the
enemy
-LRB-
though
near
a
hundred
in
number
-RRB-
,
seeing
the
fate
of
their
*NL*
general
,
gave
back
many
paces
,
and
retired
behind
a
new-dug
grave
;
for
*NL*
the
churchyard
was
the
field
of
battle
,
where
there
was
to
be
a
*NL*
funeral
that
very
evening
.
Molly
pursued
her
victory
,
and
catching
up
*NL*
a
skull
which
lay
on
the
side
of
the
grave
,
discharged
it
with
such
*NL*
fury
,
that
having
hit
a
taylor
on
the
head
,
the
two
skulls
sent
*NL*
equally
forth
a
hollow
sound
at
their
meeting
,
and
the
taylor
took
*NL*
presently
measure
of
his
length
on
the
ground
,
where
the
skulls
lay
*NL*
side
by
side
,
and
it
was
doubtful
which
was
the
more
valuable
of
the
*NL*
two
.
Molly
then
taking
a
thigh-bone
in
her
hand
,
fell
in
among
the
*NL*
flying
ranks
,
and
dealing
her
blows
with
great
liberality
on
either
*NL*
side
,
overthrew
the
carcass
of
many
a
mighty
heroe
and
heroine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Recount
,
O
Muse
,
the
names
of
those
who
fell
on
this
fatal
day
.
First
,
*NL*
Jemmy
Tweedle
felt
on
his
hinder
head
the
direful
bone
.
Him
the
*NL*
pleasant
banks
of
sweetly-winding
Stour
had
nourished
,
where
he
first
*NL*
learnt
the
vocal
art
,
with
which
,
wandering
up
and
down
at
wakes
and
*NL*
fairs
,
he
cheered
the
rural
nymphs
and
swains
,
when
upon
the
green
*NL*
they
interweaved
the
sprightly
dance
;
while
he
himself
stood
fiddling
*NL*
and
jumping
to
his
own
music
.
How
little
now
avails
his
fiddle
!
He
*NL*
thumps
the
verdant
floor
with
his
carcass
.
Next
,
old
Echepole
,
the
*NL*
sowgelder
,
received
a
blow
in
his
forehead
from
our
Amazonian
heroine
,
*NL*
and
immediately
fell
to
the
ground
.
He
was
a
swinging
fat
fellow
,
and
*NL*
fell
with
almost
as
much
noise
as
a
house
.
His
tobacco-box
dropped
at
*NL*
the
same
time
from
his
pocket
,
which
Molly
took
up
as
lawful
spoils
.
*NL*
Then
Kate
of
the
Mill
tumbled
unfortunately
over
a
tombstone
,
which
*NL*
catching
hold
of
her
ungartered
stocking
inverted
the
order
of
nature
,
*NL*
and
gave
her
heels
the
superiority
to
her
head
.
Betty
Pippin
,
with
*NL*
young
Roger
her
lover
,
fell
both
to
the
ground
;
where
,
oh
perverse
*NL*
fate
!
she
salutes
the
earth
,
and
he
the
sky
.
Tom
Freckle
,
the
smith
's
*NL*
son
,
was
the
next
victim
to
her
rage
.
He
was
an
ingenious
workman
,
and
*NL*
made
excellent
pattens
;
nay
,
the
very
patten
with
which
he
was
knocked
*NL*
down
was
his
own
workmanship
.
Had
he
been
at
that
time
singing
psalms
*NL*
in
the
church
,
he
would
have
avoided
a
broken
head
.
Miss
Crow
,
the
*NL*
daughter
of
a
farmer
;
John
Giddish
,
himself
a
farmer
;
Nan
Slouch
,
*NL*
Esther
Codling
,
Will
Spray
,
Tom
Bennet
;
the
three
Misses
Potter
,
whose
*NL*
father
keeps
the
sign
of
the
Red
Lion
;
Betty
Chambermaid
,
Jack
Ostler
,
*NL*
and
many
others
of
inferior
note
,
lay
rolling
among
the
graves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
the
strenuous
arm
of
Molly
reached
all
these
;
for
many
of
*NL*
them
in
their
flight
overthrew
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
Fortune
,
fearing
she
had
acted
out
of
character
,
and
had
*NL*
inclined
too
long
to
the
same
side
,
especially
as
it
was
the
right
*NL*
side
,
hastily
turned
about
:
for
now
Goody
Brown
--
whom
Zekiel
Brown
*NL*
caressed
in
his
arms
;
nor
he
alone
,
but
half
the
parish
besides
;
so
*NL*
famous
was
she
in
the
fields
of
Venus
,
nor
indeed
less
in
those
of
*NL*
Mars
.
The
trophies
of
both
these
her
husband
always
bore
about
on
his
*NL*
head
and
face
;
for
if
ever
human
head
did
by
its
horns
display
the
*NL*
amorous
glories
of
a
wife
,
Zekiel
's
did
;
nor
did
his
well-scratched
*NL*
face
less
denote
her
talents
-LRB-
or
rather
talons
-RRB-
of
a
different
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
longer
bore
this
Amazon
the
shameful
flight
of
her
party
.
She
stopt
*NL*
short
,
and
,
calling
aloud
to
all
who
fled
,
spoke
as
follows
:
``
Ye
*NL*
Somersetshire
men
,
or
rather
ye
Somersetshire
women
,
are
ye
not
*NL*
ashamed
thus
to
fly
from
a
single
woman
?
But
if
no
other
will
oppose
*NL*
her
,
I
myself
and
Joan
Top
here
will
have
the
honour
of
the
victory
.
''
*NL*
Having
thus
said
,
she
flew
at
Molly
Seagrim
,
and
easily
wrenched
the
*NL*
thigh-bone
from
her
hand
,
at
the
same
time
clawing
off
her
cap
from
*NL*
her
head
.
Then
laying
hold
of
the
hair
of
Molly
with
her
left
hand
,
*NL*
she
attacked
her
so
furiously
in
the
face
with
the
right
,
that
the
*NL*
blood
soon
began
to
trickle
from
her
nose
.
Molly
was
not
idle
this
*NL*
while
.
She
soon
removed
the
clout
from
the
head
of
Goody
Brown
,
and
*NL*
then
fastening
on
her
hair
with
one
hand
,
with
the
other
she
caused
*NL*
another
bloody
stream
to
issue
forth
from
the
nostrils
of
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
each
of
the
combatants
had
borne
off
sufficient
spoils
of
hair
*NL*
from
the
head
of
her
antagonist
,
the
next
rage
was
against
the
*NL*
garments
.
In
this
attack
they
exerted
so
much
violence
,
that
in
a
very
*NL*
few
minutes
they
were
both
naked
to
the
middle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
lucky
for
the
women
that
the
seat
of
fistycuff
war
is
not
the
*NL*
same
with
them
as
among
men
;
but
though
they
may
seem
a
little
to
*NL*
deviate
from
their
sex
,
when
they
go
forth
to
battle
,
yet
I
have
*NL*
observed
,
they
never
so
far
forget
,
as
to
assail
the
bosoms
of
each
*NL*
other
;
where
a
few
blows
would
be
fatal
to
most
of
them
.
This
,
I
know
,
*NL*
some
derive
from
their
being
of
a
more
bloody
inclination
than
the
*NL*
males
.
On
which
account
they
apply
to
the
nose
,
as
to
the
part
whence
*NL*
blood
may
most
easily
be
drawn
;
but
this
seems
a
far-fetched
as
well
*NL*
as
ill-natured
supposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Goody
Brown
had
great
advantage
of
Molly
in
this
particular
;
for
the
*NL*
former
had
indeed
no
breasts
,
her
bosom
-LRB-
if
it
may
be
so
called
-RRB-
,
as
*NL*
well
in
colour
as
in
many
other
properties
,
exactly
resembling
an
*NL*
antient
piece
of
parchment
,
upon
which
any
one
might
have
drummed
a
*NL*
considerable
while
without
doing
her
any
great
damage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Molly
,
beside
her
present
unhappy
condition
,
was
differently
formed
in
*NL*
those
parts
,
and
might
,
perhaps
,
have
tempted
the
envy
of
Brown
to
*NL*
give
her
a
fatal
blow
,
had
not
the
lucky
arrival
of
Tom
Jones
at
this
*NL*
instant
put
an
immediate
end
to
the
bloody
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
accident
was
luckily
owing
to
Mr
Square
;
for
he
,
Master
Blifil
,
*NL*
and
Jones
,
had
mounted
their
horses
,
after
church
,
to
take
the
air
,
*NL*
and
had
ridden
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
when
Square
,
changing
his
*NL*
mind
-LRB-
not
idly
,
but
for
a
reason
which
we
shall
unfold
as
soon
as
we
*NL*
have
leisure
-RRB-
,
desired
the
young
gentlemen
to
ride
with
him
another
*NL*
way
than
they
had
at
first
purposed
.
This
motion
being
complied
with
,
*NL*
brought
them
of
necessity
back
again
to
the
churchyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Blifil
,
who
rode
first
,
seeing
such
a
mob
assembled
,
and
two
*NL*
women
in
the
posture
in
which
we
left
the
combatants
,
stopt
his
horse
*NL*
to
enquire
what
was
the
matter
.
A
country
fellow
,
scratching
his
head
,
*NL*
answered
him
:
``
I
do
n't
know
,
measter
,
u
n't
I
;
a
n't
please
your
honour
,
*NL*
here
hath
been
a
vight
,
I
think
,
between
Goody
Brown
and
Moll
*NL*
Seagrim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
,
who
?
''
cries
Tom
;
but
without
waiting
for
an
answer
,
having
*NL*
discovered
the
features
of
his
Molly
through
all
the
discomposure
in
*NL*
which
they
now
were
,
he
hastily
alighted
,
turned
his
horse
loose
,
and
,
*NL*
leaping
over
the
wall
,
ran
to
her
.
She
now
first
bursting
into
tears
,
*NL*
told
him
how
barbarously
she
had
been
treated
.
Upon
which
,
forgetting
*NL*
the
sex
of
Goody
Brown
,
or
perhaps
not
knowing
it
in
his
rage
--
for
,
in
*NL*
reality
,
she
had
no
feminine
appearance
but
a
petticoat
,
which
he
*NL*
might
not
observe
--
he
gave
her
a
lash
or
two
with
his
horsewhip
;
and
*NL*
then
flying
at
the
mob
,
who
were
all
accused
by
Moll
,
he
dealt
his
*NL*
blows
so
profusely
on
all
sides
,
that
unless
I
would
again
invoke
the
*NL*
muse
-LRB-
which
the
good-natured
reader
may
think
a
little
too
hard
upon
*NL*
her
,
as
she
hath
so
lately
been
violently
sweated
-RRB-
,
it
would
be
*NL*
impossible
for
me
to
recount
the
horse-whipping
of
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
scoured
the
whole
coast
of
the
enemy
,
as
well
as
any
of
Homer
's
*NL*
heroes
ever
did
,
or
as
Don
Quixote
or
any
knight-errant
in
the
world
*NL*
could
have
done
,
he
returned
to
Molly
,
whom
he
found
in
a
condition
*NL*
which
must
give
both
me
and
my
reader
pain
,
was
it
to
be
described
*NL*
here
.
Tom
raved
like
a
madman
,
beat
his
breast
,
tore
his
hair
,
stamped
*NL*
on
the
ground
,
and
vowed
the
utmost
vengeance
on
all
who
had
been
*NL*
concerned
.
He
then
pulled
off
his
coat
,
and
buttoned
it
round
her
,
put
*NL*
his
hat
upon
her
head
,
wiped
the
blood
from
her
face
as
well
as
he
*NL*
could
with
his
handkerchief
,
and
called
out
to
the
servant
to
ride
as
*NL*
fast
as
possible
for
a
side-saddle
,
or
a
pillion
,
that
he
might
carry
*NL*
her
safe
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Blifil
objected
to
the
sending
away
the
servant
,
as
they
had
*NL*
only
one
with
them
;
but
as
Square
seconded
the
order
of
Jones
,
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
comply
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
returned
in
a
very
short
time
with
the
pillion
,
and
Molly
,
*NL*
having
collected
her
rags
as
well
as
she
could
,
was
placed
behind
him
.
*NL*
In
which
manner
she
was
carried
home
,
Square
,
Blifil
,
and
Jones
*NL*
attending
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Jones
having
received
his
coat
,
given
her
a
sly
kiss
,
and
*NL*
whispered
her
,
that
he
would
return
in
the
evening
,
quitted
his
Molly
,
*NL*
and
rode
on
after
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
ix
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
matter
of
no
very
peaceable
colour
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Molly
had
no
sooner
apparelled
herself
in
her
accustomed
rags
,
than
*NL*
her
sisters
began
to
fall
violently
upon
her
,
particularly
her
eldest
*NL*
sister
,
who
told
her
she
was
well
enough
served
.
``
How
had
she
the
*NL*
assurance
to
wear
a
gown
which
young
Madam
Western
had
given
to
*NL*
mother
!
If
one
of
us
was
to
wear
it
,
I
think
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
myself
*NL*
have
the
best
right
;
but
I
warrant
you
think
it
belongs
to
your
*NL*
beauty
.
I
suppose
you
think
yourself
more
handsomer
than
any
of
*NL*
us
.
''
--
``
Hand
her
down
the
bit
of
glass
from
over
the
cupboard
,
''
cries
*NL*
another
;
``
I
'd
wash
the
blood
from
my
face
before
I
talked
of
my
*NL*
beauty
.
''
--
``
You
'd
better
have
minded
what
the
parson
says
,
''
cries
the
*NL*
eldest
,
``
and
not
a
harkened
after
men
voke
.
''
--
``
Indeed
,
child
,
and
so
*NL*
she
had
,
''
says
the
mother
,
sobbing
:
``
she
hath
brought
a
disgrace
upon
*NL*
us
all
.
She
's
the
vurst
of
the
vamily
that
ever
was
a
whore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
upbraid
me
with
that
,
mother
,
''
cries
Molly
;
``
you
*NL*
yourself
was
brought-to-bed
of
sister
there
,
within
a
week
after
you
*NL*
was
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
hussy
,
''
answered
the
enraged
mother
,
``
so
I
was
,
and
what
was
the
*NL*
mighty
matter
of
that
?
I
was
made
an
honest
woman
then
;
and
if
you
was
*NL*
to
be
made
an
honest
woman
,
I
should
not
be
angry
;
but
you
must
have
*NL*
to
doing
with
a
gentleman
,
you
nasty
slut
;
you
will
have
a
bastard
,
*NL*
hussy
,
you
will
;
and
that
I
defy
any
one
to
say
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
situation
Black
George
found
his
family
,
when
he
came
home
for
*NL*
the
purpose
before
mentioned
.
As
his
wife
and
three
daughters
were
all
*NL*
of
them
talking
together
,
and
most
of
them
crying
,
it
was
some
time
*NL*
before
he
could
get
an
opportunity
of
being
heard
;
but
as
soon
as
such
*NL*
an
interval
occurred
,
he
acquainted
the
company
with
what
Sophia
had
*NL*
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Goody
Seagrim
then
began
to
revile
her
daughter
afresh
.
``
Here
,
''
says
*NL*
she
,
``
you
have
brought
us
into
a
fine
quandary
indeed
.
What
will
madam
*NL*
say
to
that
big
belly
?
Oh
that
ever
I
should
live
to
see
this
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Molly
answered
with
great
spirit
,
``
And
what
is
this
mighty
place
which
*NL*
you
have
got
for
me
,
father
?
''
-LRB-
for
he
had
not
well
understood
the
*NL*
phrase
used
by
Sophia
of
being
about
her
person
-RRB-
.
``
I
suppose
it
is
to
*NL*
be
under
the
cook
;
but
I
sha
n't
wash
dishes
for
anybody
.
My
gentleman
*NL*
will
provide
better
for
me
.
See
what
he
hath
given
me
this
afternoon
.
*NL*
He
hath
promised
I
shall
never
want
money
;
and
you
sha
n't
want
money
*NL*
neither
,
mother
,
if
you
will
hold
your
tongue
,
and
know
when
you
are
*NL*
well
.
''
And
so
saying
,
she
pulled
out
several
guineas
,
and
gave
her
*NL*
mother
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
woman
no
sooner
felt
the
gold
within
her
palm
,
than
her
*NL*
temper
began
-LRB-
such
is
the
efficacy
of
that
panacea
-RRB-
to
be
mollified
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
husband
,
''
says
she
,
``
would
any
but
such
a
blockhead
as
you
not
*NL*

place
this
was
before
he
had
accepted
it
?
Perhaps
,
*NL*
as
Molly
says
,
it
may
be
in
the
kitchen
;
and
truly
I
do
n't
care
my
*NL*
daughter
should
be
a
scullion
wench
;
for
,
poor
as
I
am
,
I
am
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
.
And
thof
I
was
obliged
,
as
my
father
,
who
was
a
*NL*
clergyman
,
died
worse
than
nothing
,
and
so
could
not
give
me
a
*NL*
shilling
of
_
potion
_
,
to
undervalue
myself
by
marrying
a
poor
man
;
yet
*NL*
I
would
have
you
to
know
,
I
have
a
spirit
above
all
them
things
.
Marry
*NL*
come
up
!
it
would
better
become
Madam
Western
to
look
at
home
,
and
*NL*
remember
who
her
own
grandfather
was
.
Some
of
my
family
,
for
aught
I
*NL*
know
,
might
ride
in
their
coaches
,
when
the
grandfathers
of
some
voke
*NL*
walked
a-voot
.
I
warrant
she
fancies
she
did
a
mighty
matter
,
when
she
*NL*
sent
us
that
old
gownd
;
some
of
my
family
would
not
have
picked
up
*NL*
such
rags
in
the
street
;
but
poor
people
are
always
trampled
*NL*
upon
.
--
The
parish
need
not
have
been
in
such
a
fluster
with
Molly
.
You
*NL*
might
have
told
them
,
child
,
your
grandmother
wore
better
things
new
*NL*
out
of
the
shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
consider
,
''
cried
George
,
``
what
answer
shall
I
make
to
*NL*
madam
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
answer
,
''
says
she
;
``
you
are
always
bringing
your
*NL*
family
into
one
quandary
or
other
.
Do
you
remember
when
you
shot
the
*NL*
partridge
,
the
occasion
of
all
our
misfortunes
?
Did
not
I
advise
you
*NL*
never
to
go
into
Squire
Western
's
manor
?
Did
not
I
tell
you
many
a
*NL*
good
year
ago
what
would
come
of
it
?
But
you
would
have
your
own
*NL*
headstrong
ways
;
yes
,
you
would
,
you
villain

''
*NL*
*NL*
Black
George
was
,
in
the
main
,
a
peaceable
kind
of
fellow
,
and
nothing
*NL*
choleric
nor
rash
;
yet
did
he
bear
about
him
something
of
what
the
*NL*
antients
called
the
irascible
,
and
which
his
wife
,
if
she
had
been
*NL*
endowed
with
much
wisdom
,
would
have
feared
.
He
had
long
experienced
,
*NL*
that
when
the
storm
grew
very
high
,
arguments
were
but
wind
,
which
*NL*
served
rather
to
increase
,
than
to
abate
it
.
He
was
therefore
seldom
*NL*
unprovided
with
a
small
switch
,
a
remedy
of
wonderful
force
,
as
he
had
*NL*
often
essayed
,
and
which
the
word
villain
served
as
a
hint
for
his
*NL*
applying
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
,
therefore
,
had
this
symptom
appeared
,
than
he
had
immediate
*NL*
recourse
to
the
said
remedy
,
which
though
,
as
it
is
usual
in
all
very
*NL*
efficacious
medicines
,
it
at
first
seemed
to
heighten
and
inflame
the
*NL*
disease
,
soon
produced
a
total
calm
,
and
restored
the
patient
to
*NL*
perfect
ease
and
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
,
however
,
a
kind
of
horse-medicine
,
which
requires
a
very
*NL*
robust
constitution
to
digest
,
and
is
therefore
proper
only
for
the
*NL*
vulgar
,
unless
in
one
single
instance
,
viz.
,
where
superiority
of
*NL*
birth
breaks
out
;
in
which
case
,
we
should
not
think
it
very
*NL*
improperly
applied
by
any
husband
whatever
,
if
the
application
was
not
*NL*
in
itself
so
base
,
that
,
like
certain
applications
of
the
physical
*NL*
kind
which
need
not
be
mentioned
,
it
so
much
degrades
and
contaminates
*NL*
the
hand
employed
in
it
,
that
no
gentleman
should
endure
the
thought
*NL*
of
anything
so
low
and
detestable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
family
were
soon
reduced
to
a
state
of
perfect
quiet
;
for
*NL*
the
virtue
of
this
medicine
,
like
that
of
electricity
,
is
often
*NL*
communicated
through
one
person
to
many
others
,
who
are
not
touched
by
*NL*
the
instrument
.
To
say
the
truth
,
as
they
both
operate
by
friction
,
it
*NL*
may
be
doubted
whether
there
is
not
something
analogous
between
them
,
*NL*
of
which
Mr
Freke
would
do
well
to
enquire
,
before
he
publishes
the
*NL*
next
edition
of
his
book

A
council
was
now
called
,
in
which
,
after
many
debates
,
Molly
still
*NL*
persisting
that
she
would
not
go
to
service
,
it
was
at
length
*NL*
resolved
,
that
Goody
Seagrim
herself
should
wait
on
Miss
Western
,
and
*NL*
endeavour
to
procure
the
place
for
her
eldest
daughter
,
who
declared
*NL*
great
readiness
to
accept
it
:
but
Fortune
,
who
seems
to
have
been
an
*NL*
enemy
of
this
little
family
,
afterwards
put
a
stop
to
her
promotion

A
story
told
by
Mr
Supple
,
the
curate
.
The
penetration
of
Squire
*NL*
Western
.
His
great
love
for
his
daughter
,
and
the
return
to
it
made
by
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
Tom
Jones
hunted
with
Mr
Western
,
and
was
at
his
*NL*
return
invited
by
that
gentleman
to
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lovely
Sophia
shone
forth
that
day
with
more
gaiety
and
*NL*
sprightliness
than
usual
.
Her
battery
was
certainly
levelled
at
our
*NL*
heroe
;
though
,
I
believe
,
she
herself
scarce
yet
knew
her
own
*NL*
intention
;
but
if
she
had
any
design
of
charming
him
,
she
now
*NL*
succeeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Supple
,
the
curate
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
parish
,
made
one
of
the
*NL*
company
.
He
was
a
good-natured
worthy
man
;
but
chiefly
remarkable
for
*NL*
his
great
taciturnity
at
table
,
though
his
mouth
was
never
shut
at
it
.
*NL*
In
short
,
he
had
one
of
the
best
appetites
in
the
world
.
However
,
the
*NL*
cloth
was
no
sooner
taken
away
,
than
he
always
made
sufficient
amends
*NL*
for
his
silence
:
for
he
was
a
very
hearty
fellow
;
and
his
conversation
*NL*
was
often
entertaining
,
never
offensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
first
arrival
,
which
was
immediately
before
the
entrance
of
the
*NL*
roast-beef
,
he
had
given
an
intimation
that
he
had
brought
some
news
*NL*
with
him
,
and
was
beginning
to
tell
,
that
he
came
that
moment
from
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
's
,
when
the
sight
of
the
roast-beef
struck
him
dumb
,
*NL*
permitting
him
only
to
say
grace
,
and
to
declare
he
must
pay
his
*NL*
respect
to
the
baronet
,
for
so
he
called
the
sirloin
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
dinner
was
over
,
being
reminded
by
Sophia
of
his
news
,
he
began
*NL*
as
follows
:
``
I
believe
,
lady
,
your
ladyship
observed
a
young
woman
at
*NL*
church
yesterday
at
even-song
,
who
was
drest
in
one
of
your
outlandish
*NL*
garments
;
I
think
I
have
seen
your
ladyship
in
such
a
one
.
However
,
in
*NL*
the
country
,
such
dresses
are
*NL*
*NL*
_
Rara
avis
in
terris
,
nigroque
simillima
cygno
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
,
madam
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
'
A
rare
bird
upon
the
earth
,
and
*NL*
very
like
a
black
swan
.
'
The
verse
is
in
Juvenal
.
But
to
return
to
*NL*
what
I
was
relating
.
I
was
saying
such
garments
are
rare
sights
in
the
*NL*
country
;
and
perchance
,
too
,
it
was
thought
the
more
rare
,
respect
*NL*
being
had
to
the
person
who
wore
it
,
who
,
they
tell
me
,
is
the
*NL*
daughter
of
Black
George
,
your
worship
's
gamekeeper
,
whose
sufferings
,
*NL*
I
should
have
opined
,
might
have
taught
him
more
wit
,
than
to
dress
*NL*
forth
his
wenches
in
such
gaudy
apparel
.
She
created
so
much
confusion
*NL*
in
the
congregation
,
that
if
Squire
Allworthy
had
not
silenced
it
,
it
*NL*
would
have
interrupted
the
service
:
for
I
was
once
about
to
stop
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
first
lesson
.
Howbeit
,
nevertheless
,
after
prayer
*NL*
was
over
,
and
I
was
departed
home
,
this
occasioned
a
battle
in
the
*NL*
churchyard
,
where
,
amongst
other
mischief
,
the
head
of
a
travelling
*NL*
fidler
was
very
much
broken
.
This
morning
the
fidler
came
to
Squire
*NL*
Allworthy
for
a
warrant
,
and
the
wench
was
brought
before
him
.
The
*NL*
squire
was
inclined
to
have
compounded
matters
;
when
,
lo
!
on
a
sudden
*NL*
the
wench
appeared
-LRB-
I
ask
your
ladyship
's
pardon
-RRB-
to
be
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
at
the
eve
of
bringing
forth
a
bastard
.
The
squire
demanded
of
her
who
*NL*
was
the
father
?
But
she
pertinaciously
refused
to
make
any
response
.
*NL*
So
that
he
was
about
to
make
her
mittimus
to
Bridewell
when
I
*NL*
departed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
a
wench
having
a
bastard
all
your
news
,
doctor
?
''
cries
*NL*
Western
;
``
I
thought
it
might
have
been
some
public
matter
,
something
*NL*
about
the
nation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
it
is
too
common
,
indeed
,
''
answered
the
parson
;
``
but
I
*NL*
thought
the
whole
story
altogether
deserved
commemorating
.
As
to
*NL*
national
matters
,
your
worship
knows
them
best
.
My
concerns
extend
no
*NL*
farther
than
my
own
parish

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
ay

''
says
the
squire
,
``
I
believe
I
do
know
a
little
of
that
*NL*
matter

as
you
say
.
But
,
come
,
Tommy
,
drink
about
;
the
bottle
stands
*NL*
with
you

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
begged
to
be
excused
,
for
that
he
had
particular
business
;
and
*NL*
getting
up
from
table
,
escaped
the
clutches
of
the
squire
,
who
was
*NL*
rising
to
stop
him
,
and
went
off
with
very
little
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
gave
him
a
good
curse
at
his
departure
;
and
then
turning
to
*NL*
the
parson
,
he
cried
out
,
``
I
smoke
it
:
I
smoke
it
.
Tom
is
certainly
*NL*
the
father
of
this
bastard
.
Zooks

Ay

as

as

Tom
is
the
veather

the
bastard

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
sorry
for
that
,
''
says
the
parson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
sorry
,
''
cries
the
squire
:
``
Where
is
the
mighty
matter
o
`
t
?
What

*NL*
I
suppose

pretend
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
worship
is
pleased
to
be
jocular
,
''
answered
the
parson
;
``
but
I
*NL*
do
not
only
animadvert
on
the
sinfulness
of
the
action
--
though
that
*NL*
surely
is
to
be
greatly
deprecated
--
but
I
fear
his
unrighteousness
may
*NL*
injure
him
with
Mr
Allworthy
.
And
truly
I
must
say
,
though
he
hath
the
*NL*
character
of
being
a
little
wild
,
I
never
saw
any
harm
in
the
young
*NL*
man
;
nor
can
I
say
I
have
heard
any
,
save
what
your
worship
now
*NL*
mentions
.
I
wish
,
indeed
,
he
was
a
little
more
regular
in
his
*NL*
responses
at
church
;
but
altogether
he
seems

That
is
a
classical
line

and
,
being
rendered
into
*NL*
English
,
is

`
a
lad
of
an
ingenuous
countenance

and
of
an
ingenuous
*NL*
modesty

for
this
was
a
virtue
in
great
repute
both
among
the
Latins
*NL*

I
must
say

the
young
gentleman
-LRB-
for
so
I
think
I
may
call
*NL*
him
,
notwithstanding
his
birth
-RRB-
appears
to
me
a
very
modest

civil

lad

I
should
be
sorry

should
do
himself
any
injury
in

``

says
the

Ask

there

*NL*
fellow
for
getting
a

This
was
a
cruel
question
to
poor
Sophia
.
She
had
observed
Tom
's
*NL*
colour
change
at
the
parson
's
story
;
and
that
,
with
his
hasty
and
*NL*
abrupt
departure
,
gave
her
sufficient
reason
to
think
her
father
's
*NL*
suspicion
not
groundless
.
Her
heart
now
at
once
discovered
the
great
*NL*
secret
to
her
which
it
had
been
so
long
disclosing
by
little
and
*NL*
little
;
and
she
found
herself
highly
interested
in
this
matter
.
In
*NL*
such
a
situation
,
her
father
's
malapert
question
rushing
suddenly
upon
*NL*
her
,
produced
some
symptoms
which
might
have
alarmed
a
suspicious
*NL*
heart
;
but
,
to
do
the
squire
justice
,
that
was
not
his
fault
.
When
she
*NL*
rose
therefore
from
her
chair
,
and
told
him
a
hint
from
him
was
always
*NL*
sufficient
to
make
her
withdraw
,
he
suffered
her
to
leave
the
room
,
*NL*
and
then
with
great
gravity
of
countenance
remarked
,
``
That
it
was
*NL*
better
to
see
a
daughter
over-modest
than
over-forward
;
''
--
a
sentiment
*NL*
which
was
highly
applauded
by
the
parson
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
now
ensued
between
the
squire
and
the
parson
a
most
excellent
*NL*
political
discourse
,
framed
out
of
newspapers
and
political
pamphlets
;
*NL*
in
which
they
made
a
libation
of
four
bottles
of
wine
to
the
good
of
*NL*
their
country
:
and
then
,
the
squire
being
fast
asleep
,
the
parson
*NL*
lighted
his
pipe
,
mounted
his
horse
,
and
rode
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
squire
had
finished
his
half-hour
's
nap
,
he
summoned
his
*NL*
daughter
to
her
harpsichord
;
but
she
begged
to
be
excused
that
*NL*
evening
,
on
account
of
a
violent
head-ache
.
This
remission
was
*NL*
presently
granted
;
for
indeed
she
seldom
had
occasion
to
ask
him
*NL*
twice
,
as
he
loved
her
with
such
ardent
affection
,
that
,
by
gratifying
*NL*
her
,
he
commonly
conveyed
the
highest
gratification
to
himself
.
She
*NL*
was
really
,
what
he
frequently
called
her
,
his
little
darling
,
and
she
*NL*
well
deserved
to
be
so
;
for
she
returned
all
his
affection
in
the
most
*NL*
ample
manner
.
She
had
preserved
the
most
inviolable
duty
to
him
in
all
*NL*
things
;
and
this
her
love
made
not
only
easy
,
but
so
delightful
,
that
*NL*
when
one
of
her
companions
laughed
at
her
for
placing
so
much
merit
in
*NL*
such
scrupulous
obedience
,
as
that
young
lady
called
it
,
Sophia
*NL*
answered
,
``
You
mistake
me
,
madam
,
if
you
think
I
value
myself
upon
*NL*
this
account
;
for
besides
that
I
am
barely
discharging
my
duty
,
I
am
*NL*
likewise
pleasing
myself
.
I
can
truly
say
I
have
no
delight
equal
to
*NL*
that
of
contributing
to
my
father
's
happiness
;
and
if
I
value
myself
,
*NL*
my
dear
,
it
is
on
having
this
power
,
and
not
on
executing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
satisfaction
,
however
,
which
poor
Sophia
was
incapable
of
*NL*
tasting
this
evening
.
She
therefore
not
only
desired
to
be
excused
*NL*
from
her
attendance
at
the
harpsichord
,
but
likewise
begged
that
he
*NL*
would
suffer
her
to
absent
herself
from
supper
.
To
this
request
*NL*
likewise
the
squire
agreed
,
though
not
without
some
reluctance
;
for
he
*NL*
scarce
ever
permitted
her
to
be
out
of
his
sight
,
unless
when
he
was
*NL*
engaged
with
his
horses
,
dogs
,
or
bottle
.
Nevertheless
he
yielded
to
*NL*
the
desire
of
his
daughter
,
though
the
poor
man
was
at
the
same
time
*NL*
obliged
to
avoid
his
own
company
-LRB-
if
I
may
so
express
myself
-RRB-
,
by
*NL*
sending
for
a
neighbouring
farmer
to
sit
with
him
.

Chapter
xi

*NL*
*NL*
The
narrow
escape
of
Molly
Seagrim
,
with
some
observations
for
which
*NL*
we
have
been
forced
to
dive
pretty
deep
into
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Jones
had
ridden
one
of
Mr
Western
's
horses
that
morning
in
the
*NL*
chase
;
so
that
having
no
horse
of
his
own
in
the
squire
's
stable
,
he
*NL*
was
obliged
to
go
home
on
foot
:
this
he
did
so
expeditiously
that
he
*NL*
ran
upwards
of
three
miles
within
the
half-hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
he
arrived
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
outward
gate
,
he
met
the
*NL*
constable
and
company
with
Molly
in
their
possession
,
whom
they
were
*NL*
conducting
to
that
house
where
the
inferior
sort
of
people
may
learn
*NL*
one
good
lesson
,
viz.
,
respect
and
deference
to
their
superiors
;
since
*NL*
it
must
show
them
the
wide
distinction
Fortune
intends
between
those
*NL*
persons
who
are
to
be
corrected
for
their
faults
,
and
those
who
are
*NL*
not
;
which
lesson
if
they
do
not
learn
,
I
am
afraid
they
very
rarely
*NL*
learn
any
other
good
lesson
,
or
improve
their
morals
,
at
the
house
of
*NL*
correction
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lawyer
may
perhaps
think
Mr
Allworthy
exceeded
his
authority
a
*NL*
little
in
this
instance
.
And
,
to
say
the
truth
,
I
question
,
as
here
*NL*
was
no
regular
information
before
him
,
whether
his
conduct
was
*NL*
strictly
regular
.
However
,
as
his
intention
was
truly
upright
,
he
*NL*
ought
to
be
excused
in
_
foro
conscientiae
_
;
since
so
many
arbitrary
*NL*
acts
are
daily
committed
by
magistrates
who
have
not
this
excuse
to
*NL*
plead
for
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
no
sooner
informed
by
the
constable
whither
they
were
*NL*
proceeding
-LRB-
indeed
he
pretty
well
guessed
it
of
himself
-RRB-
,
than
he
*NL*
caught
Molly
in
his
arms
,
and
embracing
her
tenderly
before
them
all
,
*NL*
swore
he
would
murder
the
first
man
who
offered
to
lay
hold
of
her
.
He
*NL*
bid
her
dry
her
eyes
and
be
comforted
;
for
,
wherever
she
went
,
he
*NL*
would
accompany
her
.
Then
turning
to
the
constable
,
who
stood
*NL*
trembling
with
his
hat
off
,
he
desired
him
,
in
a
very
mild
voice
,
to
*NL*
return
with
him
for
a
moment
only
to
his
father
-LRB-
for
so
he
now
called
*NL*
Allworthy
-RRB-
;
for
he
durst
,
he
said
,
be
assured
,
that
,
when
he
had
*NL*
alledged
what
he
had
to
say
in
her
favour
,
the
girl
would
be
*NL*
discharged
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
constable
,
who
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
would
have
surrendered
his
*NL*
prisoner
had
Tom
demanded
her
,
very
readily
consented
to
this
request
.
*NL*
So
back
they
all
went
into
Mr
Allworthy
's
hall
;
where
Tom
desired
them
*NL*
to
stay
till
his
return
,
and
then
went
himself
in
pursuit
of
the
good
*NL*
man
.
As
soon
as
he
was
found
,
Tom
threw
himself
at
his
feet
,
and
*NL*
having
begged
a
patient
hearing
,
confessed
himself
to
be
the
father
of
*NL*
the
child
of
which
Molly
was
then
big
.
He
entreated
him
to
have
*NL*
compassion
on
the
poor
girl
,
and
to
consider
,
if
there
was
any
guilt
*NL*
in
the
case
,
it
lay
principally
at
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
is
any
guilt
in
the
case
!
''
answered
Allworthy
warmly
:
``
Are
*NL*
you
then
so
profligate
and
abandoned
a
libertine
to
doubt
whether
the
*NL*
breaking
the
laws
of
God
and
man
,
the
corrupting
and
ruining
a
poor
*NL*
girl
be
guilt
?
I
own
,
indeed
,
it
doth
lie
principally
upon
you
;
and
so
*NL*
heavy
it
is
,
that
you
ought
to
expect
it
should
crush
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
may
be
my
fate
,
''
says
Tom
,
``
let
me
succeed
in
my
*NL*
intercessions
for
the
poor
girl
.
I
confess
I
have
corrupted
her
!
but
*NL*
whether
she
shall
be
ruined
,
depends
on
you
.
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
*NL*
revoke
your
warrant
,
and
do
not
send
her
to
a
place
which
must
*NL*
unavoidably
prove
her
destruction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
bid
him
immediately
call
a
servant
.
Tom
answered
there
was
*NL*
no
occasion
;
for
he
had
luckily
met
them
at
the
gate
,
and
relying
upon
*NL*
his
goodness
,
had
brought
them
all
back
into
his
hall
,
where
they
now
*NL*
waited
his
final
resolution
,
which
upon
his
knees
he
besought
him
*NL*
might
be
in
favour
of
the
girl
;
that
she
might
be
permitted
to
go
home
*NL*
to
her
parents
,
and
not
be
exposed
to
a
greater
degree
of
shame
and
*NL*
scorn
than
must
necessarily
fall
upon
her
.
``
I
know
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
is
*NL*
too
much
.
I
know
I
am
the
wicked
occasion
of
it
.
I
will
endeavour
to
*NL*
make
amends
,
if
possible
;
and
if
you
shall
have
hereafter
the
goodness
*NL*
to
forgive
me
,
I
hope
I
shall
deserve
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
hesitated
some
time
,
and
at
last
said
,
``
Well
,
I
will
*NL*
discharge
my
mittimus
.
--
You
may
send
the
constable
to
me
.
''
He
was
*NL*
instantly
called
,
discharged
,
and
so
was
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
believed
that
Mr
Allworthy
failed
not
to
read
Tom
a
very
*NL*
severe
lecture
on
this
occasion
;
but
it
is
unnecessary
to
insert
it
*NL*
here
,
as
we
have
faithfully
transcribed
what
he
said
to
Jenny
Jones
in
*NL*
the
first
book
,
most
of
which
may
be
applied
to
the
men
,
equally
with
*NL*
the
women
.
So
sensible
an
effect
had
these
reproofs
on
the
young
man
,
*NL*
who
was
no
hardened
sinner
,
that
he
retired
to
his
own
room
,
where
he
*NL*
passed
the
evening
alone
,
in
much
melancholy
contemplation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
was
sufficiently
offended
by
this
transgression
of
Jones
;
*NL*
for
notwithstanding
the
assertions
of
Mr
Western
,
it
is
certain
this
*NL*
worthy
man
had
never
indulged
himself
in
any
loose
pleasures
with
*NL*
women
,
and
greatly
condemned
the
vice
of
incontinence
in
others
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
there
is
much
reason
to
imagine
that
there
was
not
the
least
*NL*
truth
in
what
Mr
Western
affirmed
,
especially
as
he
laid
the
scene
of
*NL*
those
impurities
at
the
university
,
where
Mr
Allworthy
had
never
been
.
*NL*
In
fact
,
the
good
squire
was
a
little
too
apt
to
indulge
that
kind
of
*NL*
pleasantry
which
is
generally
called
rhodomontade
:
but
which
may
,
with
*NL*
as
much
propriety
,
be
expressed
by
a
much
shorter
word
;
and
perhaps
we
*NL*
too
often
supply
the
use
of
this
little
monosyllable
by
others
;
since
*NL*
very
much
of
what
frequently
passes
in
the
world
for
wit
and
humour
,
*NL*
should
,
in
the
strictest
purity
of
language
,
receive
that
short
*NL*
appellation
,
which
,
in
conformity
to
the
well-bred
laws
of
custom
,
I
*NL*
here
suppress
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whatever
detestation
Mr
Allworthy
had
to
this
or
to
any
other
*NL*
vice
,
he
was
not
so
blinded
by
it
but
that
he
could
discern
any
virtue
*NL*
in
the
guilty
person
,
as
clearly
indeed
as
if
there
had
been
no
*NL*
mixture
of
vice
in
the
same
character
.
While
he
was
angry
therefore
*NL*
with
the
incontinence
of
Jones
,
he
was
no
less
pleased
with
the
honour
*NL*
and
honesty
of
his
self-accusation
.
He
began
now
to
form
in
his
mind
*NL*
the
same
opinion
of
this
young
fellow
,
which
,
we
hope
,
our
reader
may
*NL*
have
conceived
.
And
in
balancing
his
faults
with
his
perfections
,
the
*NL*
latter
seemed
rather
to
preponderate
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
to
no
purpose
,
therefore
,
that
Thwackum
,
who
was
immediately
*NL*
charged
by
Mr
Blifil
with
the
story
,
unbended
all
his
rancour
against
*NL*
poor
Tom
.
Allworthy
gave
a
patient
hearing
to
their
invectives
,
and
*NL*
then
answered
coldly
:
``
That
young
men
of
Tom
's
complexion
were
too
*NL*
generally
addicted
to
this
vice
;
but
he
believed
that
youth
was
*NL*
sincerely
affected
with
what
he
had
said
to
him
on
the
occasion
,
and
*NL*
he
hoped
he
would
not
transgress
again
.
''
So
that
,
as
the
days
of
*NL*
whipping
were
at
an
end
,
the
tutor
had
no
other
vent
but
his
own
mouth
*NL*
for
his
gall
,
the
usual
poor
resource
of
impotent
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Square
,
who
was
a
less
violent
,
was
a
much
more
artful
man
;
and
as
*NL*
he
hated
Jones
more
perhaps
than
Thwackum
himself
did
,
so
he
contrived
*NL*
to
do
him
more
mischief
in
the
mind
of
Mr
Allworthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
must
remember
the
several
little
incidents
of
the
*NL*
partridge
,
the
horse
,
and
the
Bible
,
which
were
recounted
in
the
*NL*
second
book
.
By
all
which
Jones
had
rather
improved
than
injured
the
*NL*
affection
which
Mr
Allworthy
was
inclined
to
entertain
for
him
.
The
*NL*
same
,
I
believe
,
must
have
happened
to
him
with
every
other
person
who
*NL*
hath
any
idea
of
friendship
,
generosity
,
and
greatness
of
spirit
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
who
hath
any
traces
of
goodness
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Square
himself
was
not
unacquainted
with
the
true
impression
which
*NL*
those
several
instances
of
goodness
had
made
on
the
excellent
heart
of
*NL*
Allworthy
;
for
the
philosopher
very
well
knew
what
virtue
was
,
though
*NL*
he
was
not
always
perhaps
steady
in
its
pursuit
;
but
as
for
Thwackum
,
*NL*
from
what
reason
I
will
not
determine
,
no
such
thoughts
ever
entered
*NL*
into
his
head
:
he
saw
Jones
in
a
bad
light
,
and
he
imagined
Allworthy
*NL*
saw
him
in
the
same
,
but
that
he
was
resolved
,
from
pride
and
*NL*
stubbornness
of
spirit
,
not
to
give
up
the
boy
whom
he
had
once
*NL*
cherished
;
since
by
so
doing
,
he
must
tacitly
acknowledge
that
his
*NL*
former
opinion
of
him
had
been
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Square
therefore
embraced
this
opportunity
of
injuring
Jones
*NL*
in
the
tenderest
part
,
by
giving
a
very
bad
turn
to
all
these
*NL*
before-mentioned
occurrences
.
``
I
am
sorry
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
own
I
*NL*
have
been
deceived
as
well
as
yourself
.
I
could
not
,
I
confess
,
help
*NL*
being
pleased
with
what
I
ascribed
to
the
motive
of
friendship
,
though
*NL*
it
was
carried
to
an
excess
,
and
all
excess
is
faulty
and
vicious
:
but
*NL*
in
this
I
made
allowance
for
youth
.
Little
did
I
suspect
that
the
*NL*
sacrifice
of
truth
,
which
we
both
imagined
to
have
been
made
to
*NL*
friendship
,
was
in
reality
a
prostitution
of
it
to
a
depraved
and
*NL*
debauched
appetite
.
You
now
plainly
see
whence
all
the
seeming
*NL*
generosity
of
this
young
man
to
the
family
of
the
gamekeeper
*NL*
proceeded
.
He
supported
the
father
in
order
to
corrupt
the
daughter
,
*NL*
and
preserved
the
family
from
starving
,
to
bring
one
of
them
to
shame
*NL*
and
ruin
.
This
is
friendship
!
this
is
generosity
!
As
Sir
Richard
*NL*
Steele
says
,
`
Gluttons
who
give
high
prices
for
delicacies
,
are
very
*NL*
worthy
to
be
called
generous
.
'
In
short
I
am
resolved
,
from
this
*NL*
instance
,
never
to
give
way
to
the
weakness
of
human
nature
more
,
nor
*NL*
to
think
anything
virtue
which
doth
not
exactly
quadrate
with
the
*NL*
unerring
rule
of
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
goodness
of
Allworthy
had
prevented
those
considerations
from
*NL*
occurring
to
himself
;
yet
were
they
too
plausible
to
be
absolutely
and
*NL*
hastily
rejected
,
when
laid
before
his
eyes
by
another
.
Indeed
what
*NL*
Square
had
said
sunk
very
deeply
into
his
mind
,
and
the
uneasiness
*NL*
which
it
there
created
was
very
visible
to
the
other
;
though
the
good
*NL*
man
would
not
acknowledge
this
,
but
made
a
very
slight
answer
,
and
*NL*
forcibly
drove
off
the
discourse
to
some
other
subject
.
It
was
well
*NL*
perhaps
for
poor
Tom
,
that
no
such
suggestions
had
been
made
before
he
*NL*
was
pardoned
;
for
they
certainly
stamped
in
the
mind
of
Allworthy
the
*NL*
first
bad
impression
concerning
Jones
.

The
reader
will
be
pleased
,
I
believe
,
to
return
with
me
to
Sophia
.
*NL*
She
passed
the
night
,
after
we
saw
her
last
,
in
no
very
agreeable
*NL*
manner
.
Sleep
befriended
her
but
little
,
and
dreams
less
.
In
the
*NL*
morning
,
when
Mrs
Honour
,
her
maid
,
attended
her
at
the
usual
hour
,
*NL*
she
was
found
already
up
and
drest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Persons
who
live
two
or
three
miles
'
distance
in
the
country
are
*NL*
considered
as
next-door
neighbours
,
and
transactions
at
the
one
house
*NL*
fly
with
incredible
celerity
to
the
other
.
Mrs
Honour
,
therefore
,
had
*NL*
heard
the
whole
story
of
Molly
's
shame
;
which
she
,
being
of
a
very
*NL*
communicative
temper
,
had
no
sooner
entered
the
apartment
of
her
*NL*
mistress
,
than
she
began
to
relate
in
the
following
manner
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
,
ma'am
,
what
doth
your
la
`
ship
think
?
the
girl
that
your
la
`
ship
*NL*
saw
at
church
on
Sunday
,
whom
you
thought
so
handsome
;
though
you
*NL*
would
not
have
thought
her
so
handsome
neither
,
if
you
had
seen
her
*NL*
nearer
,
but
to
be
sure
she
hath
been
carried
before
the
justice
for
*NL*
being
big
with
child
.
She
seemed
to
me
to
look
like
a
confident
slut
:
*NL*
and
to
be
sure
she
hath
laid
the
child
to
young
Mr
Jones
.
And
all
the
*NL*
parish
says
Mr
Allworthy
is
so
angry
with
young
Mr
Jones
,
that
he
*NL*
wo
n't
see
him
.
To
be
sure
,
one
ca
n't
help
pitying
the
poor
young
man
,
*NL*
and
yet
he
doth
not
deserve
much
pity
neither
,
for
demeaning
himself
*NL*
with
such
kind
of
trumpery
.
Yet
he
is
so
pretty
a
gentleman
,
I
should
*NL*
be
sorry
to
have
him
turned
out
of
doors
.
I
dares
to
swear
the
wench
*NL*
was
as
willing
as
he
;
for
she
was
always
a
forward
kind
of
body
.
And
*NL*
when
wenches
are
so
coming
,
young
men
are
not
so
much
to
be
blamed
*NL*
neither
;
for
to
be
sure
they
do
no
more
than
what
is
natural
.
Indeed
*NL*
it
is
beneath
them
to
meddle
with
such
dirty
draggle-tails
;
and
*NL*
whatever
happens
to
them
,
it
is
good
enough
for
them
.
And
yet
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
the
vile
baggages
are
most
in
fault
.
I
wishes
,
with
all
my
*NL*
heart
,
they
were
well
to
be
whipped
at
the
cart
's
tail
;
for
it
is
pity
*NL*
they
should
be
the
ruin
of
a
pretty
young
gentleman
;
and
nobody
can
*NL*
deny
but
that
Mr
Jones
is
one
of
the
most
handsomest
young
men
that
*NL*
ever
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
running
on
thus
,
when
Sophia
,
with
a
more
peevish
voice
than
*NL*
she
had
ever
spoken
to
her
in
before
,
cried
,
``
Prithee
,
why
dost
thou
*NL*
trouble
me
with
all
this
stuff
?
What
concern
have
I
in
what
Mr
Jones
*NL*
doth
?
I
suppose
you
are
all
alike
.
And
you
seem
to
me
to
be
angry
it
*NL*
was
not
your
own
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
ma'am
!
''
answered
Mrs
Honour
,
``
I
am
sorry
your
ladyship
should
have
*NL*
such
an
opinion
of
me
.
I
am
sure
nobody
can
say
any
such
thing
of
me
.
*NL*
All
the
young
fellows
in
the
world
may
go
to
the
divil
for
me
.
Because
*NL*
I
said
he
was
a
handsome
man
?
Everybody
says
it
as
well
as
I.
To
be
*NL*
sure
,
I
never
thought
as
it
was
any
harm
to
say
a
young
man
was
*NL*
handsome
;
but
to
be
sure
I
shall
never
think
him
so
any
more
now
;
for
*NL*
handsome
is
that
handsome
does
.
A
beggar
wench
!
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
thy
torrent
of
impertinence
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
``
and
see
whether
my
*NL*
father
wants
me
at
breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
then
flung
out
of
the
room
,
muttering
much
to
herself
,
of
*NL*
which
``
Marry
come
up
,
I
assure
you
,
''
was
all
that
could
be
plainly
*NL*
distinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Mrs
Honour
really
deserved
that
suspicion
,
of
which
her
*NL*
mistress
gave
her
a
hint
,
is
a
matter
which
we
can
not
indulge
our
*NL*
reader
's
curiosity
by
resolving
.
We
will
,
however
,
make
him
amends
in
*NL*
disclosing
what
passed
in
the
mind
of
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
be
pleased
to
recollect
,
that
a
secret
affection
for
*NL*
Mr
Jones
had
insensibly
stolen
into
the
bosom
of
this
young
lady
.
That
*NL*
it
had
there
grown
to
a
pretty
great
height
before
she
herself
had
*NL*
discovered
it
.
When
she
first
began
to
perceive
its
symptoms
,
the
*NL*
sensations
were
so
sweet
and
pleasing
,
that
she
had
not
resolution
*NL*
sufficient
to
check
or
repel
them
;
and
thus
she
went
on
cherishing
a
*NL*
passion
of
which
she
never
once
considered
the
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
incident
relating
to
Molly
first
opened
her
eyes
.
She
now
first
*NL*
perceived
the
weakness
of
which
she
had
been
guilty
;
and
though
it
*NL*
caused
the
utmost
perturbation
in
her
mind
,
yet
it
had
the
effect
of
*NL*
other
nauseous
physic
,
and
for
the
time
expelled
her
distemper
.
Its
*NL*
operation
indeed
was
most
wonderfully
quick
;
and
in
the
short
*NL*
interval
,
while
her
maid
was
absent
,
so
entirely
removed
all
symptoms
,
*NL*
that
when
Mrs
Honour
returned
with
a
summons
from
her
father
,
she
was
*NL*
become
perfectly
easy
,
and
had
brought
herself
to
a
thorough
*NL*
indifference
for
Mr
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
diseases
of
the
mind
do
in
almost
every
particular
imitate
those
*NL*
of
the
body
.
For
which
reason
,
we
hope
,
that
learned
faculty
,
for
whom
*NL*
we
have
so
profound
a
respect
,
will
pardon
us
the
violent
hands
we
*NL*
have
been
necessitated
to
lay
on
several
words
and
phrases
,
which
of
*NL*
right
belong
to
them
,
and
without
which
our
descriptions
must
have
*NL*
been
often
unintelligible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
there
is
no
one
circumstance
in
which
the
distempers
of
the
mind
*NL*
bear
a
more
exact
analogy
to
those
which
are
called
bodily
,
than
that
*NL*
aptness
which
both
have
to
a
relapse
.
This
is
plain
in
the
violent
*NL*
diseases
of
ambition
and
avarice
.
I
have
known
ambition
,
when
cured
at
*NL*
court
by
frequent
disappointments
-LRB-
which
are
the
only
physic
for
it
-RRB-
,
*NL*
to
break
out
again
in
a
contest
for
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
at
an
*NL*
assizes
;
and
have
heard
of
a
man
who
had
so
far
conquered
avarice
,
as
*NL*
to
give
away
many
a
sixpence
,
that
comforted
himself
,
at
last
,
on
his
*NL*
deathbed
,
by
making
a
crafty
and
advantageous
bargain
concerning
his
*NL*
ensuing
funeral
,
with
an
undertaker
who
had
married
his
only
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
affair
of
love
,
which
,
out
of
strict
conformity
with
the
Stoic
*NL*
philosophy
,
we
shall
here
treat
as
a
disease
,
this
proneness
to
*NL*
relapse
is
no
less
conspicuous
.
Thus
it
happened
to
poor
Sophia
;
upon
*NL*
whom
,
the
very
next
time
she
saw
young
Jones
,
all
the
former
symptoms
*NL*
returned
,
and
from
that
time
cold
and
hot
fits
alternately
seized
her
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
of
this
young
lady
was
now
very
different
from
what
it
*NL*
had
ever
been
before
.
That
passion
which
had
formerly
been
so
*NL*
exquisitely
delicious
,
became
now
a
scorpion
in
her
bosom
.
She
*NL*
resisted
it
therefore
with
her
utmost
force
,
and
summoned
every
*NL*
argument
her
reason
-LRB-
which
was
surprisingly
strong
for
her
age
-RRB-
could
*NL*
suggest
,
to
subdue
and
expel
it
.
In
this
she
so
far
succeeded
,
that
*NL*
she
began
to
hope
from
time
and
absence
a
perfect
cure
.
She
resolved
*NL*
therefore
to
avoid
Tom
Jones
as
much
as
possible
;
for
which
purpose
*NL*
she
began
to
conceive
a
design
of
visiting
her
aunt
,
to
which
she
made
*NL*
no
doubt
of
obtaining
her
father
's
consent
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fortune
,
who
had
other
designs
in
her
head
,
put
an
immediate
stop
*NL*
to
any
such
proceeding
,
by
introducing
an
accident
,
which
will
be
*NL*
related
in
the
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
xiii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dreadful
accident
which
befel
Sophia
.
The
gallant
behaviour
of
*NL*
Jones
,
and
the
more
dreadful
consequence
of
that
behaviour
to
the
*NL*
young
lady
;
with
a
short
digression
in
favour
of
the
female
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
grew
every
day
fonder
and
fonder
of
Sophia
,
insomuch
that
*NL*
his
beloved
dogs
themselves
almost
gave
place
to
her
in
his
*NL*
affections
;
but
as
he
could
not
prevail
on
himself
to
abandon
these
,
*NL*
he
contrived
very
cunningly
to
enjoy
their
company
,
together
with
that
*NL*
of
his
daughter
,
by
insisting
on
her
riding
a
hunting
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
to
whom
her
father
's
word
was
a
law
,
readily
complied
with
his
*NL*
desires
,
though
she
had
not
the
least
delight
in
a
sport
,
which
was
of
*NL*
too
rough
and
masculine
a
nature
to
suit
with
her
disposition
.
She
had
*NL*
however
another
motive
,
beside
her
obedience
,
to
accompany
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
in
the
chase
;
for
by
her
presence
she
hoped
in
some
measure
*NL*
to
restrain
his
impetuosity
,
and
to
prevent
him
from
so
frequently
*NL*
exposing
his
neck
to
the
utmost
hazard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strongest
objection
was
that
which
would
have
formerly
been
an
*NL*
inducement
to
her
,
namely
,
the
frequent
meeting
with
young
Jones
,
whom
*NL*
she
had
determined
to
avoid
;
but
as
the
end
of
the
hunting
season
now
*NL*
approached
,
she
hoped
,
by
a
short
absence
with
her
aunt
,
to
reason
*NL*
herself
entirely
out
of
her
unfortunate
passion
;
and
had
not
any
doubt
*NL*
of
being
able
to
meet
him
in
the
field
the
subsequent
season
without
*NL*
the
least
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
second
day
of
her
hunting
,
as
she
was
returning
from
the
chase
,
*NL*
and
was
arrived
within
a
little
distance
from
Mr
Western
's
house
,
her
*NL*
horse
,
whose
mettlesome
spirit
required
a
better
rider
,
fell
suddenly
*NL*
to
prancing
and
capering
in
such
a
manner
that
she
was
in
the
most
*NL*
imminent
peril
of
falling
.
Tom
Jones
,
who
was
at
a
little
distance
*NL*
behind
,
saw
this
,
and
immediately
galloped
up
to
her
assistance
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
he
came
up
,
he
leapt
from
his
own
horse
,
and
caught
hold
of
*NL*
hers
by
the
bridle
.
The
unruly
beast
presently
reared
himself
an
end
*NL*
on
his
hind
legs
,
and
threw
his
lovely
burthen
from
his
back
,
and
*NL*
Jones
caught
her
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
affected
with
the
fright
,
that
she
was
not
immediately
able
*NL*
to
satisfy
Jones
,
who
was
very
sollicitous
to
know
whether
she
had
*NL*
received
any
hurt
.
She
soon
after
,
however
,
recovered
her
spirits
,
*NL*
assured
him
she
was
safe
,
and
thanked
him
for
the
care
he
had
taken
of
*NL*
her
.
Jones
answered
,
``
If
I
have
preserved
you
,
madam
,
I
am
*NL*
sufficiently
repaid
;
for
I
promise
you
,
I
would
have
secured
you
from
*NL*
the
least
harm
at
the
expense
of
a
much
greater
misfortune
to
myself
*NL*
than
I
have
suffered
on
this
occasion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
misfortune
?
''
replied
Sophia
eagerly
;
``
I
hope
you
have
come
to
no
*NL*
mischief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
concerned
,
madam
,
''
answered
Jones
.
``
Heaven
be
praised
you
have
*NL*
escaped
so
well
,
considering
the
danger
you
was
in
.
If
I
have
broke
my
*NL*
arm
,
I
consider
it
as
a
trifle
,
in
comparison
of
what
I
feared
upon
*NL*
your
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
then
screamed
out
,
``
Broke
your
arm
!
Heaven
forbid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
have
,
madam
,
''
says
Jones
:
``
but
I
beg
you
will
suffer
me
*NL*
first
to
take
care
of
you
.
I
have
a
right
hand
yet
at
your
service
,
to
*NL*
help
you
into
the
next
field
,
whence
we
have
but
a
very
little
walk
to
*NL*
your
father
's
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
seeing
his
left
arm
dangling
by
his
side
,
while
he
was
using
*NL*
the
other
to
lead
her
,
no
longer
doubted
of
the
truth
.
She
now
grew
*NL*
much
paler
than
her
fears
for
herself
had
made
her
before
.
All
her
*NL*
limbs
were
seized
with
a
trembling
,
insomuch
that
Jones
could
scarce
*NL*
support
her
;
and
as
her
thoughts
were
in
no
less
agitation
,
she
could
*NL*
not
refrain
from
giving
Jones
a
look
so
full
of
tenderness
,
that
it
*NL*
almost
argued
a
stronger
sensation
in
her
mind
,
than
even
gratitude
*NL*
and
pity
united
can
raise
in
the
gentlest
female
bosom
,
without
the
*NL*
assistance
of
a
third
more
powerful
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
,
who
was
advanced
at
some
distance
when
this
accident
*NL*
happened
,
was
now
returned
,
as
were
the
rest
of
the
horsemen
.
Sophia
*NL*
immediately
acquainted
them
with
what
had
befallen
Jones
,
and
begged
*NL*
them
to
take
care
of
him
.
Upon
which
Western
,
who
had
been
much
*NL*
alarmed
by
meeting
his
daughter
's
horse
without
its
rider
,
and
was
now
*NL*
overjoyed
to
find
her
unhurt
,
cried
out
,
``
I
am
glad
it
is
no
worse
.
If
*NL*
Tom
hath
broken
his
arm
,
we
will
get
a
joiner
to
mend
un
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
alighted
from
his
horse
,
and
proceeded
to
his
house
on
*NL*
foot
,
with
his
daughter
and
Jones
.
An
impartial
spectator
,
who
had
met
*NL*
them
on
the
way
,
would
,
on
viewing
their
several
countenances
,
have
*NL*
concluded
Sophia
alone
to
have
been
the
object
of
compassion
:
for
as
*NL*
to
Jones
,
he
exulted
in
having
probably
saved
the
life
of
the
young
*NL*
lady
,
at
the
price
only
of
a
broken
bone
;
and
Mr
Western
,
though
he
*NL*
was
not
unconcerned
at
the
accident
which
had
befallen
Jones
,
was
,
*NL*
however
,
delighted
in
a
much
higher
degree
with
the
fortunate
escape
*NL*
of
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
generosity
of
Sophia
's
temper
construed
this
behaviour
of
Jones
*NL*
into
great
bravery
;
and
it
made
a
deep
impression
on
her
heart
:
for
*NL*
certain
it
is
,
that
there
is
no
one
quality
which
so
generally
*NL*
recommends
men
to
women
as
this
;
proceeding
,
if
we
believe
the
common
*NL*
opinion
,
from
that
natural
timidity
of
the
sex
,
which
is
,
says
Mr
*NL*
Osborne
,
``
so
great
,
that
a
woman
is
the
most
cowardly
of
all
the
*NL*
creatures
God
ever
made
;
''
--
a
sentiment
more
remarkable
for
its
*NL*
bluntness
than
for
its
truth
.
Aristotle
,
in
his
Politics
,
doth
them
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
more
justice
,
when
he
says
,
``
The
modesty
and
fortitude
of
men
*NL*
differ
from
those
virtues
in
women
;
for
the
fortitude
which
becomes
a
*NL*
woman
,
would
be
cowardice
in
a
man
;
and
the
modesty
which
becomes
a
*NL*
man
,
would
be
pertness
in
a
woman
.
''
Nor
is
there
,
perhaps
,
more
of
*NL*
truth
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
derive
the
partiality
which
women
*NL*
are
inclined
to
show
to
the
brave
,
from
this
excess
of
their
fear
.
Mr
*NL*
Bayle
-LRB-
I
think
,
in
his
article
of
Helen
-RRB-
imputes
this
,
and
with
*NL*
greater
probability
,
to
their
violent
love
of
glory
;
for
the
truth
of
*NL*
which
,
we
have
the
authority
of
him
who
of
all
others
saw
farthest
*NL*
into
human
nature
,
and
who
introduces
the
heroine
of
his
Odyssey
,
the
*NL*
great
pattern
of
matrimonial
love
and
constancy
,
assigning
the
glory
*NL*
of
her
husband
as
the
only
source
of
her
affection
towards
him
.

The

reader
will
not
find
this
in

for
the
*NL*
sentiment
is
entirely
left
out
in

.
*NL*
*NL*
However
this
be
,
certain
it
is
that
the
accident
operated
very
*NL*
strongly
on
Sophia
;
and
,
indeed
,
after
much
enquiry
into
the
matter
,
I
*NL*
am
inclined
to
believe
,
that
,
at
this
very
time
,
the
charming
Sophia
*NL*
made
no
less
impression
on
the
heart
of
Jones
;
to
say
truth
,
he
had
*NL*
for
some
time
become
sensible
of
the
irresistible
power
of
her
charms

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
The
arrival
of
a
surgeon
.
--
His
operations
,
and
a
long
dialogue
between
*NL*
Sophia
and
her
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
arrived
at
Mr
Western
's
hall
,
Sophia
,
who
had
tottered
along
*NL*
with
much
difficulty
,
sunk
down
in
her
chair
;
but
by
the
assistance
of
*NL*
hartshorn
and
water
,
she
was
prevented
from
fainting
away
,
and
had
*NL*
pretty
well
recovered
her
spirits
,
when
the
surgeon
who
was
sent
for
*NL*
to
Jones
appeared
.
Mr
Western
,
who
imputed
these
symptoms
in
his
*NL*
daughter
to
her
fall
,
advised
her
to
be
presently
blooded
by
way
of
*NL*
prevention
.
In
this
opinion
he
was
seconded
by
the
surgeon
,
who
gave
*NL*
so
many
reasons
for
bleeding
,
and
quoted
so
many
cases
where
persons
*NL*
had
miscarried
for
want
of
it
,
that
the
squire
became
very
*NL*
importunate
,
and
indeed
insisted
peremptorily
that
his
daughter
should
*NL*
be
blooded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
soon
yielded
to
the
commands
of
her
father
,
though
entirely
*NL*
contrary
to
her
own
inclinations
,
for
she
suspected
,
I
believe
,
less
*NL*
danger
from
the
fright
,
than
either
the
squire
or
the
surgeon
.
She
*NL*
then
stretched
out
her
beautiful
arm
,
and
the
operator
began
to
*NL*
prepare
for
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
servants
were
busied
in
providing
materials
,
the
surgeon
,
*NL*
who
imputed
the
backwardness
which
had
appeared
in
Sophia
to
her
*NL*
fears
,
began
to
comfort
her
with
assurances
that
there
was
not
the
*NL*
least
danger
;
for
no
accident
,
he
said
,
could
ever
happen
in
bleeding
,
*NL*
but
from
the
monstrous
ignorance
of
pretenders
to
surgery
,
which
he
*NL*
pretty
plainly
insinuated
was
not
at
present
to
be
apprehended
.
Sophia
*NL*
declared
she
was
not
under
the
least
apprehension
;
adding
,
``
If
you
*NL*
open
an
artery
,
I
promise
you
I
'll
forgive
you
.
''
``
Will
you
?
''
cries
*NL*
Western
:
``
D
--
n
me
,
if
I
will
.
If
he
does
thee
the
least
mischief
,
d
--
n
*NL*
me
if
I
do
n't
ha
'
the
heart
's
blood
o'un
out
.
''
The
surgeon
assented
to
*NL*
bleed
her
upon
these
conditions
,
and
then
proceeded
to
his
operation
,
*NL*
which
he
performed
with
as
much
dexterity
as
he
had
promised
;
and
with
*NL*
as
much
quickness
:
for
he
took
but
little
blood
from
her
,
saying
,
it
*NL*
was
much
safer
to
bleed
again
and
again
,
than
to
take
away
too
much
at
*NL*
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
when
her
arm
was
bound
up
,
retired
:
for
she
was
not
willing
*NL*
-LRB-
nor
was
it
,
perhaps
,
strictly
decent
-RRB-
to
be
present
at
the
operation
*NL*
on
Jones
.
Indeed
,
one
objection
which
she
had
to
bleeding
-LRB-
though
she
*NL*
did
not
make
it
-RRB-
was
the
delay
which
it
would
occasion
to
setting
the
*NL*
broken
bone
.
For
Western
,
when
Sophia
was
concerned
,
had
no
*NL*
consideration
but
for
her
;
and
as
for
Jones
himself
,
he
``
sat
like
*NL*
patience
on
a
monument
smiling
at
grief
.
''
To
say
the
truth
,
when
he
*NL*
saw
the
blood
springing
from
the
lovely
arm
of
Sophia
,
he
scarce
*NL*
thought
of
what
had
happened
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
surgeon
now
ordered
his
patient
to
be
stript
to
his
shirt
,
and
*NL*
then
entirely
baring
the
arm
,
he
began
to
stretch
and
examine
it
,
in
*NL*
such
a
manner
that
the
tortures
he
put
him
to
caused
Jones
to
make
*NL*
several
wry
faces
;
which
the
surgeon
observing
,
greatly
wondered
at
,
*NL*
crying
,
``
What
is
the
matter
,
sir
?
I
am
sure
it
is
impossible
I
should
*NL*
hurt
you
.
''
And
then
holding
forth
the
broken
arm
,
he
began
a
long
and
*NL*
very
learned
lecture
of
anatomy
,
in
which
simple
and
double
fractures
*NL*
were
most
accurately
considered
;
and
the
several
ways
in
which
Jones
*NL*
might
have
broken
his
arm
were
discussed
,
with
proper
annotations
*NL*
showing
how
many
of
these
would
have
been
better
,
and
how
many
worse
*NL*
than
the
present
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
at
length
finished
his
laboured
harangue
,
with
which
the
*NL*
audience
,
though
it
had
greatly
raised
their
attention
and
admiration
,
*NL*
were
not
much
edified
,
as
they
really
understood
not
a
single
syllable
*NL*
of
all
he
had
said
,
he
proceeded
to
business
,
which
he
was
more
*NL*
expeditious
in
finishing
,
than
he
had
been
in
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
then
ordered
into
a
bed
,
which
Mr
Western
compelled
him
to
*NL*
accept
at
his
own
house
,
and
sentence
of
water-gruel
was
passed
upon
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
good
company
which
had
attended
in
the
hall
during
the
*NL*
bone-setting
,
Mrs
Honour
was
one
;
who
being
summoned
to
her
mistress
*NL*
as
soon
as
it
was
over
,
and
asked
by
her
how
the
young
gentleman
did
,
*NL*
presently
launched
into
extravagant
praises
on
the
magnanimity
,
as
she
*NL*
called
it
,
of
his
behaviour
,
which
,
she
said
,
``
was
so
charming
in
so
*NL*
pretty
a
creature
.
''
She
then
burst
forth
into
much
warmer
encomiums
on
*NL*
the
beauty
of
his
person
;
enumerating
many
particulars
,
and
ending
*NL*
with
the
whiteness
of
his
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
discourse
had
an
effect
on
Sophia
's
countenance
,
which
would
not
*NL*
perhaps
have
escaped
the
observance
of
the
sagacious
waiting-woman
,
*NL*
had
she
once
looked
her
mistress
in
the
face
,
all
the
time
she
was
*NL*
speaking
:
but
as
a
looking-glass
,
which
was
most
commodiously
placed
*NL*
opposite
to
her
,
gave
her
an
opportunity
of
surveying
those
features
,
*NL*
in
which
,
of
all
others
,
she
took
most
delight
;
so
she
had
not
once
*NL*
removed
her
eyes
from
that
amiable
object
during
her
whole
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
was
so
intirely
wrapped
up
in
the
subject
on
which
she
*NL*
exercised
her
tongue
,
and
the
object
before
her
eyes
,
that
she
gave
*NL*
her
mistress
time
to
conquer
her
confusion
;
which
having
done
,
she
*NL*
smiled
on
her
maid
,
and
told
her
,
``
she
was
certainly
in
love
with
this
*NL*
young
fellow
.
''
--
``
I
in
love
,
madam
!
''
answers
she
:
``
upon
my
word
,
ma'am
,
*NL*
I
assure
you
,
ma'am
,
upon
my
soul
,
ma'am
,
I
am
not
.
''
--
``
Why
,
if
you
*NL*
was
,
''
cries
her
mistress
,
``
I
see
no
reason
that
you
should
be
ashamed
*NL*
of
it
;
for
he
is
certainly
a
pretty
fellow
.
''
--
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
''
answered
*NL*
the
other
,
``
that
he
is
,
the
most
handsomest
man
I
ever
saw
in
my
life
.
*NL*
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
that
he
is
,
and
,
as
your
ladyship
says
,
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
why
I
should
be
ashamed
of
loving
him
,
though
he
is
my
betters
.
To
be
*NL*
sure
,
gentlefolks
are
but
flesh
and
blood
no
more
than
us
servants

*NL*
Besides
,
as
for
Mr
Jones
,
thof
Squire
Allworthy
hath
made
a
gentleman
*NL*
of
him
,
he
was
not
so
good
as
myself
by
birth
:
for
thof
I
am
a
poor
*NL*
body
,
I
am
an
honest
person
's
child
,
and
my
father
and
mother
were
*NL*
married
,
which
is
more
than
some
people
can
say
,
as
high
as
they
hold
*NL*
their
heads
.
Marry
,
come
up
!
I
assure
you
,
my
dirty
cousin
!
thof
his
*NL*
skin
be
so
white
,
and
to
be
sure
it
is
the
most
whitest
that
ever
was
*NL*
seen
,
I
am
a
Christian
as
well
as
he
,
and
nobody
can
say
that
I
am
*NL*
base
born
:
my
grandfather
was
a
clergyman
,
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
and
would
have
been
very
*NL*
angry
,
I
believe
,
to
have
thought
any
of
his
family
should
have
taken
*NL*
up
with
Molly
Seagrim
's
dirty
leavings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
This
is
the
second
person
of
low
condition
whom
we
have
recorded
*NL*
in
this
history
to
have
sprung
from
the
clergy
.
It
is
to
be
hoped
*NL*
such
instances
will
,
in
future
ages
,
when
some
provision
is
made
for
*NL*
the
families
of
the
inferior
clergy
,
appear
stranger
than
they
can
*NL*
be
thought
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
Sophia
might
have
suffered
her
maid
to
run
on
in
this
manner
,
*NL*
from
wanting
sufficient
spirits
to
stop
her
tongue
,
which
the
reader
*NL*
may
probably
conjecture
was
no
very
easy
task
;
for
certainly
there
*NL*
were
some
passages
in
her
speech
which
were
far
from
being
agreeable
*NL*
to
the
lady
.
However
,
she
now
checked
the
torrent
,
as
there
seemed
no
*NL*
end
of
its
flowing
.
``
I
wonder
,
''
says
she
,
``
at
your
assurance
in
daring
*NL*
to
talk
thus
of
one
of
my
father
's
friends
.
As
to
the
wench
,
I
order
*NL*
you
never
to
mention
her
name
to
me

And
with
regard
to
the
young
*NL*
gentleman
's
birth
,
those
who
can
say
nothing
more
to
his
disadvantage
,
*NL*
may
as
well
be
silent
on

I
desire
you
will
be

future

*NL*
*NL*
``

am
sorry

answered
Mrs

``
I

sure
I

I

talk
hath
been

bastards

I
have

,
I
could
tell
your
ladyship
something
,
but
that
I
*NL*
am
afraid
it
would
offend
you
.
''
--
``
What
could
you
tell
me
,
Honour
?
''
*NL*
says
Sophia
.
``
Nay
,
ma'am
,
to
be
sure
he
meant
nothing
by
it
,
therefore
*NL*
I
would
not
have
your
ladyship
be
offended
.
''
--
``
Prithee
tell
me
,
''
says
*NL*
Sophia
;
``
I
will
know
it
this
instant
.
''
--
``
Why
,
ma'am
,
''
answered
Mrs
*NL*
Honour
,
``
he
came
into
the
room
one
day
last
week
when
I
was
at
work
,
*NL*
and
there
lay
your
ladyship
's
muff
on
a
chair
,
and
to
be
sure
he
put
*NL*
his
hands
into
it
;
that
very
muff
your
ladyship
gave
me
but
yesterday
.
*NL*
La
!
says
I
,
Mr
Jones
,
you
will
stretch
my
lady
's
muff
,
and
spoil
it
:
*NL*
but
he
still
kept
his
hands
in
it
:
and
then
he
kissed
it
--
to
be
sure
I
*NL*
hardly
ever
saw
such
a
kiss
in
my
life
as
he
gave
it
.
''
--
``
I
suppose
he
*NL*
did
not
know
it
was
mine
,
''
replied
Sophia
.
``
Your
ladyship
shall
hear
,
*NL*
ma'am
.
He
kissed
it
again
and
again
,
and
said
it
was
the
prettiest
*NL*
muff
in
the
world
.
La
!
sir
,
says
I
,
you
have
seen
it
a
hundred
times
.
*NL*
Yes
,
Mrs
Honour
,
cried
he
;
but
who
can
see
anything
beautiful
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
your
lady
but
herself
?
--
Nay
,
that
's
not
all
neither
;
but
I
*NL*
hope
your
ladyship
wo
n't
be
offended
,
for
to
be
sure
he
meant
nothing
.
*NL*
One
day
,
as
your
ladyship
was
playing
on
the
harpsichord
to
my
master
,
*NL*
Mr
Jones
was
sitting
in
the
next
room
,
and
methought
he
looked
*NL*
melancholy
.
La
!
says
I
,
Mr
Jones
,
what
's
the
matter
?
a
penny
for
your
*NL*
thoughts
,
says
I.
Why
,
hussy
,
says
he
,
starting
up
from
a
dream
,
what
*NL*
can
I
be
thinking
of
,
when
that
angel
your
mistress
is
playing
?
And
*NL*
then
squeezing
me
by
the
hand
,
Oh
!
Mrs
Honour
,
says
he
,
how
happy
will
*NL*
that
man
be
!
--
and
then
he
sighed
.
Upon
my
troth
,
his
breath
is
as
*NL*
sweet
as
a
nosegay
.
--
But
to
be
sure
he
meant
no
harm
by
it
.
So
I
hope
*NL*
your
ladyship
will
not
mention
a
word
;
for
he
gave
me
a
crown
never
to
*NL*
mention
it
,
and
made
me
swear
upon
a
book
,
but
I
believe
,
indeed
,
it
*NL*
was
not
the
Bible
.

*NL*
*NL*
Till
something
of
a
more
beautiful
red
than
vermilion
be
found
out
,
I
*NL*
shall
say
nothing
of
Sophia
's
colour
on
this
occasion
.
``
Ho

*NL*
says
she
,
``
I

you
will
not
mention
this
any
more

anybody

not
betray
you

I

you
give

spoken

I

I
believe
so

Yes

says
he

But
I
*NL*
ask
your

pardon

I
could
tear
my
tongue
out

you

``
Go
on

''
says
Sophia
;
``
you
may
mention
anything
you
have
not

told
me
before

``
Yes

was
some
time

afterwards

am
neither
such
a
coxcomb

such
a
villain

any

always
worship

This
was
all

I
will
be
sworn

to
the
best
of
my
*NL*
remembrance
.
I
was
in
a
passion
with
him
myself
,

I
found

meant
*NL*
no

``
Indeed
,
Honour
,

says
Sophia
,
``
I
believe
you
have
a
real

affection

I
was
provoked
the
other
day

I
almost

Here
the
dinner
bell
interrupted
a
conversation
which
had
wrought
such
*NL*
an
effect
on
Sophia
,
that
she
was
,
perhaps
,
more
obliged
to
her
*NL*
bleeding
in
the
morning

she

at

had
apprehended

As
to
the
present

I
shall
adhere
to
*NL*
a
rule
of
Horace
,
by
not
attempting
to
describe
it

from
despair
of
*NL*
success
.
Most
of
my

will
suggest
it
easily
to
themselves

*NL*
the
few
who
can
not

would
not

at

would
deny

*NL*
Chapter
i.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
SERIOUS
in
writing
,
and
for
what
purpose
it
is
introduced
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Peradventure
there
may
be
no
parts
in
this
prodigious
work
which
will
*NL*
give
the
reader
less
pleasure
in
the
perusing
,
than
those
which
have
*NL*
given
the
author
the
greatest
pains
in
composing
.
Among
these
probably
*NL*
may
be
reckoned
those
initial
essays
which
we
have
prefixed
to
the
*NL*
historical
matter
contained
in
every
book
;
and
which
we
have
*NL*
determined
to
be
essentially
necessary
to
this
kind
of
writing
,
of
*NL*
which
we
have
set
ourselves
at
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
our
determination
we
do
not
hold
ourselves
strictly
bound
to
*NL*
assign
any
reason
;
it
being
abundantly
sufficient
that
we
have
laid
it
*NL*
down
as
a
rule
necessary
to
be
observed
in
all
prosai-comi-epic
*NL*
writing
.
Who
ever
demanded
the
reasons
of
that
nice
unity
of
time
or
*NL*
place
which
is
now
established
to
be
so
essential
to
dramatic
poetry
?
*NL*
What
critic
hath
been
ever
asked
,
why
a
play
may
not
contain
two
days
*NL*
as
well
as
one
?
Or
why
the
audience
-LRB-
provided
they
travel
,
like
*NL*
electors
,
without
any
expense
-RRB-
may
not
be
wafted
fifty
miles
as
well
*NL*
as
five
?
Hath
any
commentator
well
accounted
for
the
limitation
which
*NL*
an
antient
critic
hath
set
to
the
drama
,
which
he
will
have
contain
*NL*
neither
more
nor
less
than
five
acts
?
Or
hath
any
one
living
attempted
*NL*
to
explain
what
the
modern
judges
of
our
theatres
mean
by
that
word
*NL*
_
low
_
;
by
which
they
have
happily
succeeded
in
banishing
all
humour
*NL*
from
the
stage
,
and
have
made
the
theatre
as
dull
as
a
drawing-room
!
*NL*
Upon
all
these
occasions
the
world
seems
to
have
embraced
a
maxim
of
*NL*
our
law
,
viz.
,
_
cuicunque
in
arte
sua
perito
credendum
est
:
_
for
it
*NL*
seems
perhaps
difficult
to
conceive
that
any
one
should
have
had
*NL*
enough
of
impudence
to
lay
down
dogmatical
rules
in
any
art
or
science
*NL*
without
the
least
foundation
.
In
such
cases
,
therefore
,
we
are
apt
to
*NL*
conclude
there
are
sound
and
good
reasons
at
the
bottom
,
though
we
are
*NL*
unfortunately
not
able
to
see
so
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
in
reality
,
the
world
have
paid
too
great
a
compliment
to
*NL*
critics
,
and
have
imagined
them
men
of
much
greater
profundity
than
*NL*
they
really
are
.
From
this
complacence
,
the
critics
have
been
*NL*
emboldened
to
assume
a
dictatorial
power
,
and
have
so
far
succeeded
,
*NL*
that
they
are
now
become
the
masters
,
and
have
the
assurance
to
give
*NL*
laws
to
those
authors
from
whose
predecessors
they
originally
received
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
critic
,
rightly
considered
,
is
no
more
than
the
clerk
,
whose
*NL*
office
it
is
to
transcribe
the
rules
and
laws
laid
down
by
those
great
*NL*
judges
whose
vast
strength
of
genius
hath
placed
them
in
the
light
of
*NL*
legislators
,
in
the
several
sciences
over
which
they
presided
.
This
*NL*
office
was
all
which
the
critics
of
old
aspired
to
;
nor
did
they
ever
*NL*
dare
to
advance
a
sentence
,
without
supporting
it
by
the
authority
of
*NL*
the
judge
from
whence
it
was
borrowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
process
of
time
,
and
in
ages
of
ignorance
,
the
clerk
began
to
*NL*
invade
the
power
and
assume
the
dignity
of
his
master
.
The
laws
of
*NL*
writing
were
no
longer
founded
on
the
practice
of
the
author
,
but
on
*NL*
the
dictates
of
the
critic
.
The
clerk
became
the
legislator
,
and
those
*NL*
very
peremptorily
gave
laws
whose
business
it
was
,
at
first
,
only
to
*NL*
transcribe
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
arose
an
obvious
,
and
perhaps
an
unavoidable
error
;
for
these
*NL*
critics
being
men
of
shallow
capacities
,
very
easily
mistook
mere
form
*NL*
for
substance
.
They
acted
as
a
judge
would
,
who
should
adhere
to
the
*NL*
lifeless
letter
of
law
,
and
reject
the
spirit
.
Little
circumstances
,
*NL*
which
were
perhaps
accidental
in
a
great
author
,
were
by
these
critics
*NL*
considered
to
constitute
his
chief
merit
,
and
transmitted
as
*NL*
essentials
to
be
observed
by
all
his
successors
.
To
these
*NL*
encroachments
,
time
and
ignorance
,
the
two
great
supporters
of
*NL*
imposture
,
gave
authority
;
and
thus
many
rules
for
good
writing
have
*NL*
been
established
,
which
have
not
the
least
foundation
in
truth
or
*NL*
nature
;
and
which
commonly
serve
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
curb
and
*NL*
restrain
genius
,
in
the
same
manner
as
it
would
have
restrained
the
*NL*
dancing-master
,
had
the
many
excellent
treatises
on
that
art
laid
it
*NL*
down
as
an
essential
rule
that
every
man
must
dance
in
chains
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
avoid
,
therefore
,
all
imputation
of
laying
down
a
rule
for
*NL*
posterity
,
founded
only
on
the
authority
of
_
ipse
dixit
_
--
for
which
,
*NL*
to
say
the
truth
,
we
have
not
the
profoundest
veneration
--
we
shall
*NL*
here
waive
the
privilege
above
contended
for
,
and
proceed
to
lay
*NL*
before
the
reader
the
reasons
which
have
induced
us
to
intersperse
*NL*
these
several
digressive
essays
in
the
course
of
this
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
we
shall
of
necessity
be
led
to
open
a
new
vein
of
knowledge
,
*NL*
which
if
it
hath
been
discovered
,
hath
not
,
to
our
remembrance
,
been
*NL*
wrought
on
by
any
antient
or
modern
writer
.
This
vein
is
no
other
than
*NL*
that
of
contrast
,
which
runs
through
all
the
works
of
the
creation
,
*NL*
and
may
probably
have
a
large
share
in
constituting
in
us
the
idea
of
*NL*
all
beauty
,
as
well
natural
as
artificial
:
for
what
demonstrates
the
*NL*
beauty
and
excellence
of
anything
but
its
reverse
?
Thus
the
beauty
of
*NL*
day
,
and
that
of
summer
,
is
set
off
by
the
horrors
of
night
and
*NL*
winter
.
And
,
I
believe
,
if
it
was
possible
for
a
man
to
have
seen
only
*NL*
the
two
former
,
he
would
have
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
their
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
avoid
too
serious
an
air
;
can
it
be
doubted
,
but
that
the
*NL*
finest
woman
in
the
world
would
lose
all
benefit
of
her
charms
in
the
*NL*
eye
of
a
man
who
had
never
seen
one
of
another
cast
?
The
ladies
*NL*
themselves
seem
so
sensible
of
this
,
that
they
are
all
industrious
to
*NL*
procure
foils
:
nay
,
they
will
become
foils
to
themselves
;
for
I
have
*NL*
observed
-LRB-
at
Bath
particularly
-RRB-
that
they
endeavour
to
appear
as
ugly
*NL*
as
possible
in
the
morning
,
in
order
to
set
off
that
beauty
which
they
*NL*
intend
to
show
you
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
artists
have
this
secret
in
practice
,
though
some
,
perhaps
,
have
*NL*
not
much
studied
the
theory
.
The
jeweller
knows
that
the
finest
*NL*
brilliant
requires
a
foil
;
and
the
painter
,
by
the
contrast
of
his
*NL*
figures
,
often
acquires
great
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
genius
among
us
will
illustrate
this
matter
fully
.
I
can
not
,
*NL*
indeed
,
range
him
under
any
general
head
of
common
artists
,
as
he
hath
*NL*
a
title
to
be
placed
among
those
*NL*
*NL*
_
Inventas

by
invented
arts
have
life
improved
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
mean
here
the
inventor
of
that
most
exquisite
entertainment
,
called
*NL*
the
English
Pantomime
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
entertainment
consisted
of
two
parts
,
which
the
inventor
*NL*
distinguished
by
the
names
of
the
serious
and
the
comic
.
The
serious
*NL*
exhibited
a
certain
number
of
heathen
gods
and
heroes
,
who
were
*NL*
certainly
the
worst
and
dullest
company
into
which
an
audience
was
*NL*
ever
introduced
;
and
-LRB-
which
was
a
secret
known
to
few
-RRB-
were
actually
*NL*
intended
so
to
be
,
in
order
to
contrast
the
comic
part
of
the
*NL*
entertainment
,
and
to
display
the
tricks
of
harlequin
to
the
better
*NL*
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
,
perhaps
,
no
very
civil
use
of
such
personages
:
but
the
*NL*
contrivance
was
,
nevertheless
,
ingenious
enough
,
and
had
its
effect
.
*NL*
And
this
will
now
plainly
appear
,
if
,
instead
of
serious
and
comic
,
we
*NL*
supply
the
words
duller
and
dullest
;
for
the
comic
was
certainly
*NL*
duller
than
anything
before
shown
on
the
stage
,
and
could
be
set
off
*NL*
only
by
that
superlative
degree
of
dulness
which
composed
the
serious
.
*NL*
So
intolerably
serious
,
indeed
,
were
these
gods
and
heroes
,
that
*NL*
harlequin
-LRB-
though
the
English
gentleman
of
that
name
is
not
at
all
*NL*
related
to
the
French
family
,
for
he
is
of
a
much
more
serious
*NL*
disposition
-RRB-
was
always
welcome
on
the
stage
,
as
he
relieved
the
*NL*
audience
from
worse
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judicious
writers
have
always
practised
this
art
of
contrast
with
*NL*
great
success
.
I
have
been
surprized
that
Horace
should
cavil
at
this
*NL*
art
in
Homer
;
but
indeed
he
contradicts
himself
in
the
very
next
line
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
Indignor
quandoque
bonus
dormitat
Homerus
;
*NL*
Verum
opere
in
longo
fas
est
obrepere
somnum
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
I
grieve
if
e'er
great
Homer
chance
to
sleep
,
*NL*
Yet
slumbers
on
long
works
have
right
to
creep
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
we
are
not
here
to
understand
,
as
perhaps
some
have
,
that
an
*NL*
author
actually
falls
asleep
while
he
is
writing
.
It
is
true
,
that
*NL*
readers
are
too
apt
to
be
so
overtaken
;
but
if
the
work
was
as
long
as
*NL*
any
of
Oldmixon
,
the
author
himself
is
too
well
entertained
to
be
*NL*
subject
to
the
least
drowsiness
.
He
is
,
as
Mr
Pope
observes
,
*NL*
*NL*
Sleepless
himself
to
give
his
readers
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
these
soporific
parts
are
so
many
scenes
of
serious
*NL*
artfully
interwoven
,
in
order
to
contrast
and
set
off
the
rest
;
and
*NL*
this
is
the
true
meaning
of
a
late
facetious
writer
,
who
told
the
*NL*
public
that
whenever
he
was
dull
they
might
be
assured
there
was
a
*NL*
design
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
light
,
then
,
or
rather
in
this
darkness
,
I
would
have
the
*NL*
reader
to
consider
these
initial
essays
.
And
after
this
warning
,
if
he
*NL*
shall
be
of
opinion
that
he
can
find
enough
of
serious
in
other
parts
*NL*
of
this
history
,
he
may
pass
over
these
,
in
which
we
profess
to
be
*NL*
laboriously
dull
,
and
begin
the
following
books
at
the
second
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
ii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
Mr
Jones
receives
many
friendly
visits
during
his
*NL*
confinement
;
with
some
fine
touches
of
the
passion
of
love
,
scarce
*NL*
visible
to
the
naked
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Jones
had
many
visitors
during
his
confinement
,
though
some
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
were
not
very
agreeable
to
him
.
Mr
Allworthy
saw
him
almost
*NL*
every
day
;
but
though
he
pitied
Tom
's
sufferings
,
and
greatly
approved
*NL*
the
gallant
behaviour
which
had
occasioned
them
;
yet
he
thought
this
*NL*
was
a
favourable
opportunity
to
bring
him
to
a
sober
sense
of
his
*NL*
indiscreet
conduct
;
and
that
wholesome
advice
for
that
purpose
could
*NL*
never
be
applied
at
a
more
proper
season
than
at
the
present
,
when
the
*NL*
mind
was
softened
by
pain
and
sickness
,
and
alarmed
by
danger
;
and
*NL*
when
its
attention
was
unembarrassed
with
those
turbulent
passions
*NL*
which
engage
us
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
all
seasons
,
therefore
,
when
the
good
man
was
alone
with
the
youth
,
*NL*
especially
when
the
latter
was
totally
at
ease
,
he
took
occasion
to
*NL*
remind
him
of
his
former
miscarriages
,
but
in
the
mildest
and
*NL*
tenderest
manner
,
and
only
in
order
to
introduce
the
caution
which
he
*NL*
prescribed
for
his
future
behaviour
;
``
on
which
alone
,
''
he
assured
him
,
*NL*
``
would
depend
his
own
felicity
,
and
the
kindness
which
he
might
yet
*NL*
promise
himself
to
receive
at
the
hands
of
his
father
by
adoption
,
*NL*
unless
he
should
hereafter
forfeit
his
good
opinion
:
for
as
to
what
*NL*
had
past
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
should
be
all
forgiven
and
forgotten
.
He
*NL*
therefore
advised
him
to
make
a
good
use
of
this
accident
,
that
so
in
*NL*
the
end
it
might
prove
a
visitation
for
his
own
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
was
likewise
pretty
assiduous
in
his
visits
;
and
he
too
*NL*
considered
a
sick-bed
to
be
a
convenient
scene
for
lectures
.
His
*NL*
stile
,
however
,
was
more
severe
than
Mr
Allworthy
's
:
he
told
his
*NL*
pupil
,
``
That
he
ought
to
look
on
his
broken
limb
as
a
judgment
from
*NL*
heaven
on
his
sins
.
That
it
would
become
him
to
be
daily
on
his
knees
,
*NL*
pouring
forth
thanksgivings
that
he
had
broken
his
arm
only
,
and
not
*NL*
his
neck
;
which
latter
,
''
he
said
,
``
was
very
probably
reserved
for
some
*NL*
future
occasion
,
and
that
,
perhaps
,
not
very
remote
.
For
his
part
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
he
had
often
wondered
some
judgment
had
not
overtaken
him
*NL*
before
;
but
it
might
be
perceived
by
this
,
that
Divine
punishments
,
*NL*
though
slow
,
are
always
sure
.
''
Hence
likewise
he
advised
him
,
``
to
*NL*
foresee
,
with
equal
certainty
,
the
greater
evils
which
were
yet
*NL*
behind
,
and
which
were
as
sure
as
this
of
overtaking
him
in
his
state
*NL*
of
reprobacy
.
These
are
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
be
averted
only
by
such
a
*NL*
thorough
and
sincere
repentance
as
is
not
to
be
expected
or
hoped
for
*NL*
from
one
so
abandoned
in
his
youth
,
and
whose
mind
,
I
am
afraid
,
is
*NL*
totally
corrupted
.
It
is
my
duty
,
however
,
to
exhort
you
to
this
*NL*
repentance
,
though
I
too
well
know
all
exhortations
will
be
vain
and
*NL*
fruitless
.
But
_
liberavi
animam
meam
.
_
I
can
accuse
my
own
conscience
*NL*
of
no
neglect
;
though
it
is
at
the
same
time
with
the
utmost
concern
I
*NL*
see
you
travelling
on
to
certain
misery
in
this
world
,
and
to
as
*NL*
certain
damnation
in
the
next
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Square
talked
in
a
very
different
strain
;
he
said
,
``
Such
accidents
as
*NL*
a
broken
bone
were
below
the
consideration
of
a
wise
man
.
That
it
was
*NL*
abundantly
sufficient
to
reconcile
the
mind
to
any
of
these
*NL*
mischances
,
to
reflect
that
they
are
liable
to
befal
the
wisest
of
*NL*
mankind
,
and
are
undoubtedly
for
the
good
of
the
whole
.
''
He
said
,
``
It
*NL*
was
a
mere
abuse
of
words
to
call
those
things
evils
,
in
which
there
*NL*
was
no
moral
unfitness
:
that
pain
,
which
was
the
worst
consequence
of
*NL*
such
accidents
,
was
the
most
contemptible
thing
in
the
world
;
''
with
*NL*
more
of
the
like
sentences
,
extracted
out
of
the
second
book
of
*NL*
Tully
's
Tusculan
questions
,
and
from
the
great
Lord
Shaftesbury
.
In
*NL*
pronouncing
these
he
was
one
day
so
eager
,
that
he
unfortunately
bit
*NL*
his
tongue
;
and
in
such
a
manner
,
that
it
not
only
put
an
end
to
his
*NL*
discourse
,
but
created
much
emotion
in
him
,
and
caused
him
to
mutter
*NL*
an
oath
or
two
:
but
what
was
worst
of
all
,
this
accident
gave
*NL*
Thwackum
,
who
was
present
,
and
who
held
all
such
doctrine
to
be
*NL*
heathenish
and
atheistical
,
an
opportunity
to
clap
a
judgment
on
his
*NL*
back
.
Now
this
was
done
with
so
malicious
a
sneer
,
that
it
totally
*NL*
unhinged
-LRB-
if
I
may
so
say
-RRB-
the
temper
of
the
philosopher
,
which
the
*NL*
bite
of
his
tongue
had
somewhat
ruffled
;
and
as
he
was
disabled
from
*NL*
venting
his
wrath
at
his
lips
,
he
had
possibly
found
a
more
violent
*NL*
method
of
revenging
himself
,
had
not
the
surgeon
,
who
was
then
luckily
*NL*
in
the
room
,
contrary
to
his
own
interest
,
interposed
and
preserved
*NL*
the
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Blifil
visited
his
friend
Jones
but
seldom
,
and
never
alone
.
This
*NL*
worthy
young
man
,
however
,
professed
much
regard
for
him
,
and
as
great
*NL*
concern
at
his
misfortune
;
but
cautiously
avoided
any
intimacy
,
lest
,
*NL*
as
he
frequently
hinted
,
it
might
contaminate
the
sobriety
of
his
own
*NL*
character
:
for
which
purpose
he
had
constantly
in
his
mouth
that
*NL*
proverb
in
which
Solomon
speaks
against
evil
communication
.
Not
that
*NL*
he
was
so
bitter
as
Thwackum
;
for
he
always
expressed
some
hopes
of
*NL*
Tom
's
reformation
;
``
which
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
unparalleled
goodness
shown
*NL*
by
his
uncle
on
this
occasion
,
must
certainly
effect
in
one
not
*NL*
absolutely
abandoned
:
''
but
concluded
,
``
if
Mr
Jones
ever
offends
*NL*
hereafter
,
I
shall
not
be
able
to
say
a
syllable
in
his
favour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Squire
Western
,
he
was
seldom
out
of
the
sick-room
,
unless
when
*NL*
he
was
engaged
either
in
the
field
or
over
his
bottle
.
Nay
,
he
would
*NL*
sometimes
retire
hither
to
take
his
beer
,
and
it
was
not
without
*NL*
difficulty
that
he
was
prevented
from
forcing
Jones
to
take
his
beer
*NL*
too
:
for
no
quack
ever
held
his
nostrum
to
be
a
more
general
panacea
*NL*
than
he
did
this
;
which
,
he
said
,
had
more
virtue
in
it
than
was
in
*NL*
all
the
physic
in
an
apothecary
's
shop
.
He
was
,
however
,
by
much
*NL*
entreaty
,
prevailed
on
to
forbear
the
application
of
this
medicine
;
*NL*
but
from
serenading
his
patient
every
hunting
morning
with
the
horn
*NL*
under
his
window
,
it
was
impossible
to
withhold
him
;
nor
did
he
ever
*NL*
lay
aside
that
hallow
,
with
which
he
entered
into
all
companies
,
when
*NL*
he
visited
Jones
,
without
any
regard
to
the
sick
person
's
being
at
*NL*
that
time
either
awake
or
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
boisterous
behaviour
,
as
it
meant
no
harm
,
so
happily
it
effected
*NL*
none
,
and
was
abundantly
compensated
to
Jones
,
as
soon
as
he
was
able
*NL*
to
sit
up
,
by
the
company
of
Sophia
,
whom
the
squire
then
brought
to
*NL*
visit
him
;
nor
was
it
,
indeed
,
long
before
Jones
was
able
to
attend
*NL*
her
to
the
harpsichord
,
where
she
would
kindly
condescend
,
for
hours
*NL*
together
,
to
charm
him
with
the
most
delicious
music
,
unless
when
the
*NL*
squire
thought
proper
to
interrupt
her
,
by
insisting
on
Old
Sir
Simon
,
*NL*
or
some
other
of
his
favourite
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
nicest
guard
which
Sophia
endeavoured
to
set
on
*NL*
her
behaviour
,
she
could
not
avoid
letting
some
appearances
now
and
*NL*
then
slip
forth
:
for
love
may
again
be
likened
to
a
disease
in
this
,
*NL*
that
when
it
is
denied
a
vent
in
one
part
,
it
will
certainly
break
out
*NL*
in
another
.
What
her
lips
,
therefore
,
concealed
,
her
eyes
,
her
*NL*
blushes
,
and
many
little
involuntary
actions
,
betrayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
when
Sophia
was
playing
on
the
harpsichord
,
and
Jones
was
*NL*
attending
,
the
squire
came
into
the
room
,
crying
,
``
There
,
Tom
,
I
have
*NL*
had
a
battle
for
thee
below-stairs
with
thick
parson
Thwackum

He
hath
*NL*
been
a
telling
Allworthy
,
before
my
face
,
that
the
broken
bone
was
a
*NL*
judgment
upon
thee
.
D

it
,
says
I
,
how
can
that
be
?
Did
he
not
come
*NL*
by
it
in
defence
of
a
young
woman
?
A
judgment
indeed
!
Pox
,
if
he
never
*NL*
doth
anything
worse
,
he
will
go
to
heaven
sooner
than
all
the
parsons
*NL*
in
the
country
.
He
hath
more
reason
to
glory
in
it
than
to
be
ashamed
*NL*
of
it
.
''
--
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
says
Jones
,
``
I
have
no
reason
for
either
;
but
*NL*
if
it
preserved
Miss
Western
,
I
shall
always
think
it
the
happiest
*NL*
accident
of
my
life
.
''
--
``
And
to

said
the
squire
,
``

Allworthy

''
Jones
thanked
*NL*
him
,
but
declined
accepting
the
offer
.
``
Nay
,
''
added
the
squire
,
``

``
If

Jones
passionately
,
``
I
would
have
given

``

answered
Western
;
``

broke

Shouldst
*NL*
forget
and
forgive
.
I
thought
hadst
been
more
a
man
than
to
bear
*NL*
malice
against
a
dumb
creature
.
''
--
Here
Sophia
interposed
,
and
put
an
*NL*
end
to
the
conversation
,
by
desiring
her
father
's
leave
to
play
to
*NL*
him
;
a
request
which
he
never
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
countenance
of
Sophia
had
undergone
more
than
one
change
during
*NL*
the
foregoing
speeches
;
and
probably
she
imputed
the
passionate
*NL*
resentment
which
Jones
had
expressed
against
the
mare
,
to
a
different
*NL*
motive
from
that
from
which
her
father
had
derived
it
.
Her
spirits
*NL*
were
at
this
time
in
a
visible
flutter
;
and
she
played
so
intolerably
*NL*
ill
,
that
had
not
Western
soon
fallen
asleep
,
he
must
have
remarked
*NL*
it
.
Jones
,
however
,
who
was
sufficiently
awake
,
and
was
not
without
an
*NL*
ear
any
more
than
without
eyes
,
made
some
observations
;
which
being
*NL*
joined
to
all
which
the
reader
may
remember
to
have
passed
formerly
,
*NL*
gave
him
pretty
strong
assurances
,
when
he
came
to
reflect
on
the
*NL*
whole
,
that
all
was
not
well
in
the
tender
bosom
of
Sophia
;
an
opinion
*NL*
which
many
young
gentlemen
will
,
I
doubt
not
,
extremely
wonder
at
his
*NL*
not
having
been
well
confirmed
in
long
ago
.
To
confess
the
truth
,
he
*NL*
had
rather
too
much
diffidence
in
himself
,
and
was
not
forward
enough
*NL*
in
seeing
the
advances
of
a
young
lady
;
a
misfortune
which
can
be
*NL*
cured
only
by
that
early
town
education
,
which
is
at
present
so
*NL*
generally
in
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
thoughts
had
fully
taken
possession
of
Jones
,
they
*NL*
occasioned
a
perturbation
in
his
mind
,
which
,
in
a
constitution
less
*NL*
pure
and
firm
than
his
,
might
have
been
,
at
such
a
season
,
attended
*NL*
with
very
dangerous
consequences
.
He
was
truly
sensible
of
the
great
*NL*
worth
of
Sophia
.
He
extremely
liked
her
person
,
no
less
admired
her
*NL*
accomplishments
,
and
tenderly
loved
her
goodness
.
In
reality
,
as
he
*NL*
had
never
once
entertained
any
thought
of
possessing
her
,
nor
had
ever
*NL*
given
the
least
voluntary
indulgence
to
his
inclinations
,
he
had
a
*NL*
much
stronger
passion
for
her
than
he
himself
was
acquainted
with
.
His
*NL*
heart
now
brought
forth
the
full
secret
,
at
the
same
time
that
it
*NL*
assured
him
the
adorable
object
returned
his
affection
.
*NL*

*NL*
Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
all
who
have
no
heart
will
think
to
contain
much
ado
about
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
perhaps
imagine
the
sensations
which
now
arose
in
*NL*
Jones
to
have
been
so
sweet
and
delicious
,
that
they
would
rather
tend
*NL*
to
produce
a
chearful
serenity
in
the
mind
,
than
any
of
those
*NL*
dangerous
effects
which
we
have
mentioned
;
but
in
fact
,
sensations
of
*NL*
this
kind
,
however
delicious
,
are
,
at
their
first
recognition
,
of
a
*NL*
very
tumultuous
nature
,
and
have
very
little
of
the
opiate
in
them
.
*NL*
They
were
,
moreover
,
in
the
present
case
,
embittered
with
certain
*NL*
circumstances
,
which
being
mixed
with
sweeter
ingredients
,
tended
*NL*
altogether
to
compose
a
draught
that
might
be
termed
bitter-sweet
;
*NL*
than
which
,
as
nothing
can
be
more
disagreeable
to
the
palate
,
so
*NL*
nothing
,
in
the
metaphorical
sense
,
can
be
so
injurious
to
the
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
first
,
though
he
had
sufficient
foundation
to
flatter
himself
in
*NL*
what
he
had
observed
in
Sophia
,
he
was
not
yet
free
from
doubt
of
*NL*
misconstruing
compassion
,
or
at
best
,
esteem
,
into
a
warmer
regard
.
He
*NL*
was
far
from
a
sanguine
assurance
that
Sophia
had
any
such
affection
*NL*
towards
him
,
as
might
promise
his
inclinations
that
harvest
,
which
,
if
*NL*
they
were
encouraged
and
nursed
,
they
would
finally
grow
up
to
*NL*
require
.
Besides
,
if
he
could
hope
to
find
no
bar
to
his
happiness
*NL*
from
the
daughter
,
he
thought
himself
certain
of
meeting
an
effectual
*NL*
bar
in
the
father
;
who
,
though
he
was
a
country
squire
in
his
*NL*
diversions
,
was
perfectly
a
man
of
the
world
in
whatever
regarded
his
*NL*
fortune
;
had
the
most
violent
affection
for
his
only
daughter
,
and
had
*NL*
often
signified
,
in
his
cups
,
the
pleasure
he
proposed
in
seeing
her
*NL*
married
to
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
county
.
Jones
was
not
so
vain
*NL*
and
senseless
a
coxcomb
as
to
expect
,
from
any
regard
which
Western
*NL*
had
professed
for
him
,
that
he
would
ever
be
induced
to
lay
aside
*NL*
these
views
of
advancing
his
daughter
.
He
well
knew
that
fortune
is
*NL*
generally
the
principal
,
if
not
the
sole
,
consideration
,
which
*NL*
operates
on
the
best
of
parents
in
these
matters
:
for
friendship
makes
*NL*
us
warmly
espouse
the
interest
of
others
;
but
it
is
very
cold
to
the
*NL*
gratification
of
their
passions
.
Indeed
,
to
feel
the
happiness
which
*NL*
may
result
from
this
,
it
is
necessary
we
should
possess
the
passion
*NL*
ourselves
.
As
he
had
therefore
no
hopes
of
obtaining
her
father
's
*NL*
consent
;
so
he
thought
to
endeavour
to
succeed
without
it
,
and
by
such
*NL*
means
to
frustrate
the
great
point
of
Mr
Western
's
life
,
was
to
make
a
*NL*
very
ill
use
of
his
hospitality
,
and
a
very
ungrateful
return
to
the
*NL*
many
little
favours
received
-LRB-
however
roughly
-RRB-
at
his
hands
.
If
he
saw
*NL*
such
a
consequence
with
horror
and
disdain
,
how
much
more
was
he
*NL*
shocked
with
what
regarded
Mr
Allworthy
;
to
whom
,
as
he
had
more
than
*NL*
filial
obligations
,
so
had
he
for
him
more
than
filial
piety
!
He
knew
*NL*
the
nature
of
that
good
man
to
be
so
averse
to
any
baseness
or
*NL*
treachery
,
that
the
least
attempt
of
such
a
kind
would
make
the
sight
*NL*
of
the
guilty
person
for
ever
odious
to
his
eyes
,
and
his
name
a
*NL*
detestable
sound
in
his
ears
.
The
appearance
of
such
unsurmountable
*NL*
difficulties
was
sufficient
to
have
inspired
him
with
despair
,
however
*NL*
ardent
his
wishes
had
been
;
but
even
these
were
contruoled
by
*NL*
compassion
for
another
woman
.
The
idea
of
lovely
Molly
now
intruded
*NL*
itself
before
him
.
He
had
sworn
eternal
constancy
in
her
arms
,
and
she
*NL*
had
as
often
vowed
never
to
out-live
his
deserting
her
.
He
now
saw
her
*NL*
in
all
the
most
shocking
postures
of
death
;
nay
,
he
considered
all
the
*NL*
miseries
of
prostitution
to
which
she
would
be
liable
,
and
of
which
he
*NL*
would
be
doubly
the
occasion
;
first
by
seducing
,
and
then
by
deserting
*NL*
her
;
for
he
well
knew
the
hatred
which
all
her
neighbours
,
and
even
*NL*
her
own
sisters
,
bore
her
,
and
how
ready
they
would
all
be
to
tear
her
*NL*
to
pieces
.
Indeed
,
he
had
exposed
her
to
more
envy
than
shame
,
or
*NL*
rather
to
the
latter
by
means
of
the
former
:
for
many
women
abused
her
*NL*
for
being
a
whore
,
while
they
envied
her
her
lover
,
and
her
finery
,
*NL*
and
would
have
been
themselves
glad
to
have
purchased
these
at
the
*NL*
same
rate
.
The
ruin
,
therefore
,
of
the
poor
girl
must
,
he
foresaw
,
*NL*
unavoidably
attend
his
deserting
her
;
and
this
thought
stung
him
to
*NL*
the
soul
.
Poverty
and
distress
seemed
to
him
to
give
none
a
right
of
*NL*
aggravating
those
misfortunes
.
The
meanness
of
her
condition
did
not
*NL*
represent
her
misery
as
of
little
consequence
in
his
eyes
,
nor
did
it
*NL*
appear
to
justify
,
or
even
to
palliate
,
his
guilt
,
in
bringing
that
*NL*
misery
upon
her
.
But
why
do
I
mention
justification
?
His
own
heart
*NL*
would
not
suffer
him
to
destroy
a
human
creature
who
,
he
thought
,
*NL*
loved
him
,
and
had
to
that
love
sacrificed
her
innocence
.
His
own
good
*NL*
heart
pleaded
her
cause
;
not
as
a
cold
venal
advocate
,
but
as
one
*NL*
interested
in
the
event
,
and
which
must
itself
deeply
share
in
all
the
*NL*
agonies
its
owner
brought
on
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
powerful
advocate
had
sufficiently
raised
the
pity
of
Jones
,
*NL*
by
painting
poor
Molly
in
all
the
circumstances
of
wretchedness
;
it
*NL*
artfully
called
in
the
assistance
of
another
passion
,
and
represented
*NL*
the
girl
in
all
the
amiable
colours
of
youth
,
health
,
and
beauty
;
as
*NL*
one
greatly
the
object
of
desire
,
and
much
more
so
,
at
least
to
a
good
*NL*
mind
,
from
being
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
object
of
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amidst
these
thoughts
,
poor
Jones
passed
a
long
sleepless
night
,
and
*NL*
in
the
morning
the
result
of
the
whole
was
to
abide
by
Molly
,
and
to
*NL*
think
no
more
of
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
virtuous
resolution
he
continued
all
the
next
day
till
the
*NL*
evening
,
cherishing
the
idea
of
Molly
,
and
driving
Sophia
from
his
*NL*
thoughts
;
but
in
the
fatal
evening
,
a
very
trifling
accident
set
all
*NL*
his
passions
again
on
float
,
and
worked
so
total
a
change
in
his
mind
,
*NL*
that
we
think
it
decent
to
communicate
it
in
a
fresh
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
chapter
,
in
which
is
contained
a
little
incident
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
visitants
,
who
paid
their
compliments
to
the
young
*NL*
gentleman
in
his
confinement
,
Mrs
Honour
was
one
.
The
reader
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
when
he
reflects
on
some
expressions
which
have
formerly
dropt
from
*NL*
her
,
may
conceive
that
she
herself
had
a
very
particular
affection
for
*NL*
Mr
Jones
;
but
,
in
reality
,
it
was
no
such
thing
.
Tom
was
a
handsome
*NL*
young
fellow
;
and
for
that
species
of
men
Mrs
Honour
had
some
regard
;
*NL*
but
this
was
perfectly
indiscriminate
;
for
having
being
crossed
in
the
*NL*
love
which
she
bore
a
certain
nobleman
's
footman
,
who
had
basely
*NL*
deserted
her
after
a
promise
of
marriage
,
she
had
so
securely
kept
*NL*
together
the
broken
remains
of
her
heart
,
that
no
man
had
ever
since
*NL*
been
able
to
possess
himself
of
any
single
fragment
.
She
viewed
all
*NL*
handsome
men
with
that
equal
regard
and
benevolence
which
a
sober
and
*NL*
virtuous
mind
bears
to
all
the
good
.
She
might
indeed
be
called
a
*NL*
lover
of
men
,
as
Socrates
was
a
lover
of
mankind
,
preferring
one
to
*NL*
another
for
corporeal
,
as
he
for
mental
qualifications
;
but
never
*NL*
carrying
this
preference
so
far
as
to
cause
any
perturbation
in
the
*NL*
philosophical
serenity
of
her
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
after
Mr
Jones
had
that
conflict
with
himself
which
we
have
*NL*
seen
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
Mrs
Honour
came
into
his
room
,
and
*NL*
finding
him
alone
,
began
in
the
following
manner
:
--
``
La
,
sir
,
where
do
*NL*
you
think
I
have
been
?
I
warrants
you
,
you
would
not
guess
in
fifty
*NL*
years
;
but
if
you
did
guess
,
to
be
sure
I
must
not
tell
you
*NL*
neither
.
''
--
``
Nay
,
if
it
be
something
which
you
must
not
tell
me
,
''
said
*NL*
Jones
,
``
I
shall
have
the
curiosity
to
enquire
,
and
I
know
you
will
not
*NL*
be
so
barbarous
to
refuse
me
.
''
--
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
cries
she
,
``
why
I
*NL*
should
refuse
you
neither
,
for
that
matter
;
for
to
be
sure
you
wo
n't
*NL*
mention
it
any
more
.
And
for
that
matter
,
if
you
knew
where
I
have
*NL*
been
,
unless
you
knew
what
I
have
been
about
,
it
would
not
signify
*NL*
much
.
Nay
,
I
do
n't
see
why
it
should
be
kept
a
secret
for
my
part
;
for
*NL*
to
be
sure
she
is
the
best
lady
in
the
world
.
''
Upon
this
,
Jones
began
*NL*
to
beg
earnestly
to
be
let
into
this
secret
,
and
faithfully
promised
*NL*
not
to
divulge
it
.
She
then
proceeded
thus
:
--
``
Why
,
you
must
know
,
sir
,
*NL*
my
young
lady
sent
me
to
enquire
after
Molly
Seagrim
,
and
to
see
*NL*
whether
the
wench
wanted
anything
;
to
be
sure
,
I
did
not
care
to
go
,
*NL*
methinks
;
but
servants
must
do
what
they
are
ordered
.
--
How
could
you
*NL*
undervalue
yourself
so
,
Mr
Jones
?
--
So
my
lady
bid
me
go
and
carry
her
*NL*
some
linen
,
and
other
things
.
She
is
too
good
.
If
such
forward
sluts
*NL*
were
sent
to
Bridewell
,
it
would
be
better
for
them
.
I
told
my
lady
,
*NL*
says
I
,
madam
,
your
la
`
ship
is
encouraging
idleness
.
''
--
``
And
was
my
*NL*
Sophia
so
good
?
''
says
Jones
.
``
My
Sophia
!
I
assure
you
,
marry
come
up
,
''
*NL*
answered
Honour
.
``
And
yet
if
you
knew
all
--
indeed
,
if
I
was
as
Mr
*NL*
Jones
,
I
should
look
a
little
higher
than
such
trumpery
as
Molly
*NL*
Seagrim
.
''
``
What
do
you
mean
by
these
words
,
''
replied
Jones
,
``
if
I
knew
*NL*
all
?
''
``
I
mean
what
I
mean
,
''
says
Honour
.
``
Do
n't
you
remember
putting
*NL*
your
hands
in
my
lady
's
muff
once
?
I
vow
I
could
almost
find
in
my
*NL*
heart
to
tell
,
if
I
was
certain
my
lady
would
never
come
to
the
*NL*
hearing
o
n't
.
''
Jones
then
made
several
solemn
protestations
.
And
*NL*
Honour
proceeded
--
``
Then
to
be
sure
,
my
lady
gave
me
that
muff
;
and
*NL*
afterwards
,
upon
hearing
what
you
had
done
''
--
``
Then
you
told
her
what
I
*NL*
had
done
?
''
interrupted
Jones
.
``
If
I
did
,
sir
,
''
answered
she
,
``
you
need
*NL*
not
be
angry
with
me
.
Many
's
the
man
would
have
given
his
head
to
have
*NL*
had
my
lady
told
,
if
they
had
known
,
--
for
,
to
be
sure
,
the
biggest
*NL*
lord
in
the
land
might
be
proud
--
but
,
I
protest
,
I
have
a
great
mind
*NL*
not
to
tell
you
.
''
Jones
fell
to
entreaties
,
and
soon
prevailed
on
her
*NL*
to
go
on
thus
.
``
You
must
know
then
,
sir
,
that
my
lady
had
given
this
*NL*
muff
to
me
;
but
about
a
day
or
two
after
I
had
told
her
the
story
,
she
*NL*
quarrels
with
her
new
muff
,
and
to
be
sure
it
is
the
prettiest
that
*NL*
ever
was
seen
.
Honour
,
says
she
,
this
is
an
odious
muff
;
it
is
too
big
*NL*
for
me
,
I
ca
n't
wear
it
:
till
I
can
get
another
,
you
must
let
me
have
*NL*
my
old
one
again
,
and
you
may
have
this
in
the
room
o
n't
--
for
she
's
a
*NL*
good
lady
,
and
scorns
to
give
a
thing
and
take
a
thing
,
I
promise
you
*NL*
that
.
So
to
be
sure
I
fetched
it
her
back
again
,
and
,
I
believe
,
she
*NL*
hath
worn
it
upon
her
arm
almost
ever
since
,
and
I
warrants
hath
given
*NL*
it
many
a
kiss
when
nobody
hath
seen
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
Mr
Western
himself
,
who
came
*NL*
to
summon
Jones
to
the
harpsichord
;
whither
the
poor
young
fellow
went
*NL*
all
pale
and
trembling
.
This
Western
observed
,
but
,
on
seeing
Mrs
*NL*
Honour
,
imputed
it
to
a
wrong
cause
;
and
having
given
Jones
a
hearty
*NL*
curse
between
jest
and
earnest
,
he
bid
him
beat
abroad
,
and
not
poach
*NL*
up
the
game
in
his
warren
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
looked
this
evening
with
more
than
usual
beauty
,
and
we
may
*NL*
believe
it
was
no
small
addition
to
her
charms
,
in
the
eye
of
Mr
*NL*
Jones
,
that
she
now
happened
to
have
on
her
right
arm
this
very
muff
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
playing
one
of
her
father
's
favourite
tunes
,
and
he
was
*NL*
leaning
on
her
chair
,
when
the
muff
fell
over
her
fingers
,
and
put
her
*NL*
out
.
This
so
disconcerted
the
squire
,
that
he
snatched
the
muff
from
*NL*
her
,
and
with
a
hearty
curse
threw
it
into
the
fire
.
Sophia
instantly
*NL*
started
up
,
and
with
the
utmost
eagerness
recovered
it
from
the
*NL*
flames
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
this
incident
will
probably
appear
of
little
consequence
to
*NL*
many
of
our
readers
;
yet
,
trifling
as
it
was
,
it
had
so
violent
an
*NL*
effect
on
poor
Jones
,
that
we
thought
it
our
duty
to
relate
it
.
In
*NL*
reality
,
there
are
many
little
circumstances
too
often
omitted
by
*NL*
injudicious
historians
,
from
which
events
of
the
utmost
importance
*NL*
arise
.
The
world
may
indeed
be
considered
as
a
vast
machine
,
in
which
*NL*
the
great
wheels
are
originally
set
in
motion
by
those
which
are
very
*NL*
minute
,
and
almost
imperceptible
to
any
but
the
strongest
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
not
all
the
charms
of
the
incomparable
Sophia
;
not
all
the
*NL*
dazzling
brightness
,
and
languishing
softness
of
her
eyes
;
the
harmony
*NL*
of
her
voice
,
and
of
her
person
;
not
all
her
wit
,
good-humour
,
*NL*
greatness
of
mind
,
or
sweetness
of
disposition
,
had
been
able
so
*NL*
absolutely
to
conquer
and
enslave
the
heart
of
poor
Jones
,
as
this
*NL*
little
incident
of
the
muff
.
Thus

of

The

Jones
was
now
taken
by
surprize

All
those
*NL*
considerations
of
honour
and
prudence
which
our
heroe
had
lately
with
*NL*
so
much
military
wisdom
placed
as
guards
over
the
avenues
of
his
*NL*
heart
,
ran
away
from
their
posts

god
of

marched
in

in

triumph

Chapter
v
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
long
chapter
,
containing
a
very
great
incident
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
this
victorious
deity
easily
expelled
his
avowed
enemies
*NL*
from
the
heart
of
Jones
,
he
found
it
more
difficult
to
supplant
the
*NL*
garrison
which
he
himself
had
placed
there
.
To
lay
aside
all
allegory
,
*NL*
the
concern
for
what
must
become
of
poor
Molly
greatly
disturbed
and
*NL*
perplexed
the
mind
of
the
worthy
youth
.
The
superior
merit
of
Sophia
*NL*
totally
eclipsed
,
or
rather
extinguished
,
all
the
beauties
of
the
poor
*NL*
girl
;
but
compassion
instead
of
contempt
succeeded
to
love
.
He
was
*NL*
convinced
the
girl
had
placed
all
her
affections
,
and
all
her
prospect
*NL*
of
future
happiness
,
in
him
only
.
For
this
he
had
,
he
knew
,
given
*NL*
sufficient
occasion
,
by
the
utmost
profusion
of
tenderness
towards
*NL*
her
:
a
tenderness
which
he
had
taken
every
means
to
persuade
her
he
*NL*
would
always
maintain
.
She
,
on
her
side
,
had
assured
him
of
her
firm
*NL*
belief
in
his
promise
,
and
had
with
the
most
solemn
vows
declared
,
*NL*
that
on
his
fulfilling
or
breaking
these
promises
,
it
depended
,
*NL*
whether
she
should
be
the
happiest
or
most
miserable
of
womankind
.
And
*NL*
to
be
the
author
of
this
highest
degree
of
misery
to
a
human
being
,
*NL*
was
a
thought
on
which
he
could
not
bear
to
ruminate
a
single
moment
.
*NL*
He
considered
this
poor
girl
as
having
sacrificed
to
him
everything
in
*NL*
her
little
power
;
as
having
been
at
her
own
expense
the
object
of
his
*NL*
pleasure
;
as
sighing
and
languishing
for
him
even
at
that
very
*NL*
instant
.
Shall
then
,
says
he
,
my
recovery
,
for
which
she
hath
so
*NL*
ardently
wished
;
shall
my
presence
,
which
she
hath
so
eagerly
*NL*
expected
,
instead
of
giving
her
that
joy
with
which
she
hath
flattered
*NL*
herself
,
cast
her
at
once
down
into
misery
and
despair
?
Can
I
be
such
*NL*
a
villain
?
Here
,
when
the
genius
of
poor
Molly
seemed
triumphant
,
the
*NL*
love
of
Sophia
towards
him
,
which
now
appeared
no
longer
dubious
,
*NL*
rushed
upon
his
mind
,
and
bore
away
every
obstacle
before
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
it
occurred
to
him
,
that
he
might
possibly
be
able
to
make
*NL*
Molly
amends
another
way
;
namely
,
by
giving
her
a
sum
of
money
.
This
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
he
almost
despaired
of
her
accepting
,
when
he
*NL*
recollected
the
frequent
and
vehement
assurances
he
had
received
from
*NL*
her
,
that
the
world
put
in
balance
with
him
would
make
her
no
amends
*NL*
for
his
loss
.
However
,
her
extreme
poverty
,
and
chiefly
her
egregious
*NL*
vanity
-LRB-
somewhat
of
which
hath
been
already
hinted
to
the
reader
-RRB-
,
*NL*
gave
him
some
little
hope
,
that
,
notwithstanding
all
her
avowed
*NL*
tenderness
,
she
might
in
time
be
brought
to
content
herself
with
a
*NL*
fortune
superior
to
her
expectation
,
and
which
might
indulge
her
*NL*
vanity
,
by
setting
her
above
all
her
equals
.
He
resolved
therefore
to
*NL*
take
the
first
opportunity
of
making
a
proposal
of
this
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
accordingly
,
when
his
arm
was
so
well
recovered
that
he
could
*NL*
walk
easily
with
it
slung
in
a
sash
,
he
stole
forth
,
at
a
season
when
*NL*
the
squire
was
engaged
in
his
field
exercises
,
and
visited
his
fair
*NL*
one
.
Her
mother
and
sisters
,
whom
he
found
taking
their
tea
,
informed
*NL*
him
first
that
Molly
was
not
at
home
;
but
afterwards
the
eldest
sister
*NL*
acquainted
him
,
with
a
malicious
smile
,
that
she
was
above
stairs
*NL*
a-bed
.
Tom
had
no
objection
to
this
situation
of
his
mistress
,
and
*NL*
immediately
ascended
the
ladder
which
led
towards
her
bed-chamber
;
but
*NL*
when
he
came
to
the
top
,
he
,
to
his
great
surprize
,
found
the
door
*NL*
fast
;
nor
could
he
for
some
time
obtain
any
answer
from
within
;
for
*NL*
Molly
,
as
she
herself
afterwards
informed
him
,
was
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
extremes
of
grief
and
joy
have
been
remarked
to
produce
very
*NL*
similar
effects
;
and
when
either
of
these
rushes
on
us
by
surprize
,
it
*NL*
is
apt
to
create
such
a
total
perturbation
and
confusion
,
that
we
are
*NL*
often
thereby
deprived
of
the
use
of
all
our
faculties
.
It
can
not
*NL*
therefore
be
wondered
at
,
that
the
unexpected
sight
of
Mr
Jones
should
*NL*
so
strongly
operate
on
the
mind
of
Molly
,
and
should
overwhelm
her
*NL*
with
such
confusion
,
that
for
some
minutes
she
was
unable
to
express
*NL*
the
great
raptures
,
with
which
the
reader
will
suppose
she
was
*NL*
affected
on
this
occasion
.
As
for
Jones
,
he
was
so
entirely
possessed
,
*NL*
and
as
it
were
enchanted
,
by
the
presence
of
his
beloved
object
,
that
*NL*
he
for
a
while
forgot
Sophia
,
and
consequently
the
principal
purpose
*NL*
of
his
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
however
,
soon
recurred
to
his
memory
;
and
after
the
first
*NL*
transports
of
their
meeting
were
over
,
he
found
means
by
degrees
to
*NL*
introduce
a
discourse
on
the
fatal
consequences
which
must
attend
*NL*
their
amour
,
if
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
had
strictly
forbidden
him
ever
*NL*
seeing
her
more
,
should
discover
that
he
still
carried
on
this
*NL*
commerce
.
Such
a
discovery
,
which
his
enemies
gave
him
reason
to
think
*NL*
would
be
unavoidable
,
must
,
he
said
,
end
in
his
ruin
,
and
consequently
*NL*
in
hers
.
Since
therefore
their
hard
fates
had
determined
that
they
*NL*
must
separate
,
he
advised
her
to
bear
it
with
resolution
,
and
swore
he
*NL*
would
never
omit
any
opportunity
,
through
the
course
of
his
life
,
of
*NL*
showing
her
the
sincerity
of
his
affection
,
by
providing
for
her
in
a
*NL*
manner
beyond
her
utmost
expectation
,
or
even
beyond
her
wishes
,
if
*NL*
ever
that
should
be
in
his
power
;
concluding
at
last
,
that
she
might
*NL*
soon
find
some
man
who
would
marry
her
,
and
who
would
make
her
much
*NL*
happier
than
she
could
be
by
leading
a
disreputable
life
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Molly
remained
a
few
moments
in
silence
,
and
then
bursting
into
a
*NL*
flood
of
tears
,
she
began
to
upbraid
him
in
the
following
words
:
``
And
*NL*
this
is
your
love
for
me
,
to
forsake
me
in
this
manner
,
now
you
have
*NL*
ruined
me
!
How
often
,
when
I
have
told
you
that
all
men
are
false
and
*NL*
perjury
alike
,
and
grow
tired
of
us
as
soon
as
ever
they
have
had
*NL*
their
wicked
wills
of
us
,
how
often
have
you
sworn
you
would
never
*NL*
forsake
me
!
And
can
you
be
such
a
perjury
man
after
all
?
What
*NL*
signifies
all
the
riches
in
the
world
to
me
without
you
,
now
you
have
*NL*
gained
my
heart
,
so
you
have
--
you
have
--
?
Why
do
you
mention
another
*NL*
man
to
me
?
I
can
never
love
any
other
man
as
long
as
I
live
.
All
other
*NL*
men
are
nothing
to
me
.
If
the
greatest
squire
in
all
the
country
would
*NL*
come
a
suiting
to
me
to-morrow
,
I
would
not
give
my
company
to
him
.
*NL*
No
,
I
shall
always
hate
and
despise
the
whole
sex
for
your
sake
.
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
proceeding
thus
,
when
an
accident
put
a
stop
to
her
tongue
,
*NL*
before
it
had
run
out
half
its
career
.
The
room
,
or
rather
garret
,
in
*NL*
which
Molly
lay
,
being
up
one
pair
of
stairs
,
that
is
to
say
,
at
the
*NL*
top
of
the
house
,
was
of
a
sloping
figure
,
resembling
the
great
Delta
*NL*
of
the
Greeks
.
The
English
reader
may
perhaps
form
a
better
idea
of
*NL*
it
,
by
being
told
that
it
was
impossible
to
stand
upright
anywhere
but
*NL*
in
the
middle
.
Now
,
as
this
room
wanted
the
conveniency
of
a
closet
,
*NL*
Molly
had
,
to
supply
that
defect
,
nailed
up
an
old
rug
against
the
*NL*
rafters
of
the
house
,
which
enclosed
a
little
hole
where
her
best
*NL*
apparel
,
such
as
the
remains
of
that
sack
which
we
have
formerly
*NL*
mentioned
,
some
caps
,
and
other
things
with
which
she
had
lately
*NL*
provided
herself
,
were
hung
up
and
secured
from
the
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
enclosed
place
exactly
fronted
the
foot
of
the
bed
,
to
which
,
*NL*
indeed
,
the
rug
hung
so
near
,
that
it
served
in
a
manner
to
supply
the
*NL*
want
of
curtains
.
Now
,
whether
Molly
,
in
the
agonies
of
her
rage
,
*NL*
pushed
this
rug
with
her
feet
;
or
Jones
might
touch
it
;
or
whether
the
*NL*
pin
or
nail
gave
way
of
its
own
accord
,
I
am
not
certain
;
but
as
Molly
*NL*
pronounced
those
last
words
,
which
are
recorded
above
,
the
wicked
rug
*NL*
got
loose
from
its
fastening
,
and
discovered
everything
hid
behind
it
;
*NL*
where
among
other
female
utensils
appeared
--
-LRB-
with
shame
I
write
it
,
*NL*
and
with
sorrow
will
it
be
read
-RRB-
--
the
philosopher
Square
,
in
a
posture
*NL*
-LRB-
for
the
place
would
not
near
admit
his
standing
upright
-RRB-
as
*NL*
ridiculous
as
can
possibly
be
conceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
posture
,
indeed
,
in
which
he
stood
,
was
not
greatly
unlike
that
of
*NL*
a
soldier
who
is
tied
neck
and
heels
;
or
rather
resembling
the
*NL*
attitude
in
which
we
often
see
fellows
in
the
public
streets
of
*NL*
London
,
who
are
not
suffering
but
deserving
punishment
by
so
standing
.
*NL*
He
had
a
nightcap
belonging
to
Molly
on
his
head
,
and
his
two
large
*NL*
eyes
,
the
moment
the
rug
fell
,
stared
directly
at
Jones
;
so
that
when
*NL*
the
idea
of
philosophy
was
added
to
the
figure
now
discovered
,
it
*NL*
would
have
been
very
difficult
for
any
spectator
to
have
refrained
*NL*
from
immoderate
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
question
not
but
the
surprize
of
the
reader
will
be
here
equal
to
*NL*
that
of
Jones
;
as
the
suspicions
which
must
arise
from
the
appearance
*NL*
of
this
wise
and
grave
man
in
such
a
place
,
may
seem
so
inconsistent
*NL*
with
that
character
which
he
hath
,
doubtless
,
maintained
hitherto
,
in
*NL*
the
opinion
of
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
confess
the
truth
,
this
inconsistency
is
rather
imaginary
than
*NL*
real
.
Philosophers
are
composed
of
flesh
and
blood
as
well
as
other
*NL*
human
creatures
;
and
however
sublimated
and
refined
the
theory
of
*NL*
these
may
be
,
a
little
practical
frailty
is
as
incident
to
them
as
to
*NL*
other
mortals
.
It
is
,
indeed
,
in
theory
only
,
and
not
in
practice
,
as
*NL*
we
have
before
hinted
,
that
consists
the
difference
:
for
though
such
*NL*
great
beings
think
much
better
and
more
wisely
,
they
always
act
*NL*
exactly
like
other
men
.
They
know
very
well
how
to
subdue
all
*NL*
appetites
and
passions
,
and
to
despise
both
pain
and
pleasure
;
and
*NL*
this
knowledge
affords
much
delightful
contemplation
,
and
is
easily
*NL*
acquired
;
but
the
practice
would
be
vexatious
and
troublesome
;
and
,
*NL*
therefore
,
the
same
wisdom
which
teaches
them
to
know
this
,
teaches
*NL*
them
to
avoid
carrying
it
into
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Square
happened
to
be
at
church
on
that
Sunday
,
when
,
as
the
reader
*NL*
may
be
pleased
to
remember
,
the
appearance
of
Molly
in
her
sack
had
*NL*
caused
all
that
disturbance
.
Here
he
first
observed
her
,
and
was
so
*NL*
pleased
with
her
beauty
,
that
he
prevailed
with
the
young
gentlemen
to
*NL*
change
their
intended
ride
that
evening
,
that
he
might
pass
by
the
*NL*
habitation
of
Molly
,
and
by
that
means
might
obtain
a
second
chance
of
*NL*
seeing
her
.
This
reason
,
however
,
as
he
did
not
at
that
time
mention
*NL*
to
any
,
so
neither
did
we
think
proper
to
communicate
it
then
to
the
*NL*
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
particulars
which
constituted
the
unfitness
of
things
in
*NL*
Mr
Square
's
opinion
,
danger
and
difficulty
were
two
.
The
difficulty
*NL*
therefore
which
he
apprehended
there
might
be
in
corrupting
this
young
*NL*
wench
,
and
the
danger
which
would
accrue
to
his
character
on
the
*NL*
discovery
,
were
such
strong
dissuasives
,
that
it
is
probable
he
at
*NL*
first
intended
to
have
contented
himself
with
the
pleasing
ideas
which
*NL*
the
sight
of
beauty
furnishes
us
with
.
These
the
gravest
men
,
after
a
*NL*
full
meal
of
serious
meditation
,
often
allow
themselves
by
way
of
*NL*
dessert
:
for
which
purpose
,
certain
books
and
pictures
find
their
way
*NL*
into
the
most
private
recesses
of
their
study
,
and
a
certain
liquorish
*NL*
part
of
natural
philosophy
is
often
the
principal
subject
of
their
*NL*
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
the
philosopher
heard
,
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
that
the
*NL*
fortress
of
virtue
had
already
been
subdued
,
he
began
to
give
a
larger
*NL*
scope
to
his
desires
.
His
appetite
was
not
of
that
squeamish
kind
*NL*
which
can
not
feed
on
a
dainty
because
another
hath
tasted
it
.
In
*NL*
short
,
he
liked
the
girl
the
better
for
the
want
of
that
chastity
,
*NL*
which
,
if
she
had
possessed
it
,
must
have
been
a
bar
to
his
pleasures
;
*NL*
he
pursued
and
obtained
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
be
mistaken
,
if
he
thinks
Molly
gave
Square
the
*NL*
preference
to
her
younger
lover
:
on
the
contrary
,
had
she
been
*NL*
confined
to
the
choice
of
one
only
,
Tom
Jones
would
undoubtedly
have
*NL*
been
,
of
the
two
,
the
victorious
person
.
Nor
was
it
solely
the
*NL*
consideration
that
two
are
better
than
one
-LRB-
though
this
had
its
proper
*NL*
weight
-RRB-
to
which
Mr
Square
owed
his
success
:
the
absence
of
Jones
*NL*
during
his
confinement
was
an
unlucky
circumstance
;
and
in
that
*NL*
interval
some
well-chosen
presents
from
the
philosopher
so
softened
*NL*
and
unguarded
the
girl
's
heart
,
that
a
favourable
opportunity
became
*NL*
irresistible
,
and
Square
triumphed
over
the
poor
remains
of
virtue
*NL*
which
subsisted
in
the
bosom
of
Molly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
about
a
fortnight
since
this
conquest
,
when
Jones
paid
the
*NL*
above-mentioned
visit
to
his
mistress
,
at
a
time
when
she
and
Square
*NL*
were
in
bed
together
.
This
was
the
true
reason
why
the
mother
denied
*NL*
her
as
we
have
seen
;
for
as
the
old
woman
shared
in
the
profits
*NL*
arising
from
the
iniquity
of
her
daughter
,
she
encouraged
and
*NL*
protected
her
in
it
to
the
utmost
of
her
power
;
but
such
was
the
envy
*NL*
and
hatred
which
the
elder
sister
bore
towards
Molly
,
that
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
she
had
some
part
of
the
booty
,
she
would
willingly
*NL*
have
parted
with
this
to
ruin
her
sister
and
spoil
her
trade
.
Hence
*NL*
she
had
acquainted
Jones
with
her
being
above-stairs
in
bed
,
in
hopes
*NL*
that
he
might
have
caught
her
in
Square
's
arms
.
This
,
however
,
Molly
*NL*
found
means
to
prevent
,
as
the
door
was
fastened
;
which
gave
her
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
conveying
her
lover
behind
that
rug
or
blanket
where
he
*NL*
now
was
unhappily
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Square
no
sooner
made
his
appearance
than
Molly
flung
herself
back
in
*NL*
her
bed
,
cried
out
she
was
undone
,
and
abandoned
herself
to
despair
.
*NL*
This
poor
girl
,
who
was
yet
but
a
novice
in
her
business
,
had
not
*NL*
arrived
to
that
perfection
of
assurance
which
helps
off
a
town
lady
in
*NL*
any
extremity
;
and
either
prompts
her
with
an
excuse
,
or
else
inspires
*NL*
her
to
brazen
out
the
matter
with
her
husband
,
who
,
from
love
of
*NL*
quiet
,
or
out
of
fear
of
his
reputation
--
and
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
from
*NL*
fear
of
the
gallant
,
who
,
like
Mr
Constant
in
the
play
,
wears
a
*NL*
sword
--
is
glad
to
shut
his
eyes
,
and
content
to
put
his
horns
in
his
*NL*
pocket
.
Molly
,
on
the
contrary
,
was
silenced
by
this
evidence
,
and
*NL*
very
fairly
gave
up
a
cause
which
she
had
hitherto
maintained
with
so
*NL*
many
tears
,
and
with
such
solemn
and
vehement
protestations
of
the
*NL*
purest
love
and
constancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
gentleman
behind
the
arras
,
he
was
not
in
much
less
*NL*
consternation
.
He
stood
for
a
while
motionless
,
and
seemed
equally
at
*NL*
a
loss
what
to
say
,
or
whither
to
direct
his
eyes
.
Jones
,
though
*NL*
perhaps
the
most
astonished
of
the
three
,
first
found
his
tongue
;
and
*NL*
being
immediately
recovered
from
those
uneasy
sensations
which
Molly
*NL*
by
her
upbraidings
had
occasioned
,
he
burst
into
a
loud
laughter
,
and
*NL*
then
saluting
Mr
Square
,
advanced
to
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
to
*NL*
relieve
him
from
his
place
of
confinement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Square
being
now
arrived
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
in
which
part
only
*NL*
he
could
stand
upright
,
looked
at
Jones
with
a
very
grave
countenance
,
*NL*
and
said
to
him
,
``
Well
,
sir
,
I
see
you
enjoy
this
mighty
discovery
,
*NL*
and
,
I
dare
swear
,
take
great
delight
in
the
thoughts
of
exposing
me
;
*NL*
but
if
you
will
consider
the
matter
fairly
,
you
will
find
you
are
*NL*
yourself
only
to
blame
.
I
am
not
guilty
of
corrupting
innocence
.
I
*NL*
have
done
nothing
for
which
that
part
of
the
world
which
judges
of
*NL*
matters
by
the
rule
of
right
,
will
condemn
me
.
Fitness
is
governed
by
*NL*
the
nature
of
things
,
and
not
by
customs
,
forms
,
or
municipal
laws
.
*NL*
Nothing
is
indeed
unfit
which
is
not
unnatural
.
''
--
``
Well
reasoned
,
old
*NL*
boy
,
''
answered
Jones
;
``
but
why
dost
thou
think
that
I
should
desire
to
*NL*
expose
thee
?
I
promise
thee
,
I
was
never
better
pleased
with
thee
in
*NL*
my
life
;
and
unless
thou
hast
a
mind
to
discover
it
thyself
,
this
*NL*
affair
may
remain
a
profound
secret
for
me
.
''
--
``
Nay
,
Mr
Jones
,
''
replied
*NL*
Square
,
``
I
would
not
be
thought
to
undervalue
reputation
.
Good
fame
is
*NL*
a
species
of
the
Kalon
,
and
it
is
by
no
means
fitting
to
neglect
it
.
*NL*
Besides
,
to
murder
one
's
own
reputation
is
a
kind
of
suicide
,
a
*NL*
detestable
and
odious
vice
.
If
you
think
proper
,
therefore
,
to
conceal
*NL*
any
infirmity
of
mine
-LRB-
for
such
I
may
have
,
since
no
man
is
perfectly
*NL*
perfect
-RRB-
,
I
promise
you
I
will
not
betray
myself
.
Things
may
be
*NL*
fitting
to
be
done
,
which
are
not
fitting
to
be
boasted
of
;
for
*NL*
by
the
perverse
judgment
of
the
world
,
that
often
becomes
the
*NL*
subject
of
censure
,
which
is
,
in
truth
,
not
only
innocent
but
*NL*
laudable
.
''
--
``
Right
!
''
cries
Jones
:
``
what
can
be
more
innocent
than
the
*NL*
indulgence
of
a
natural
appetite
?
or
what
more
laudable
than
the
*NL*
propagation
of
our
species
?
''
--
``
To
be
serious
with
you
,
''
answered
*NL*
Square
,
``
I
profess
they
always
appeared
so
to
me
.
''
--
``
And
yet
,
''
said
*NL*
Jones
,
``
you
was
of
a
different
opinion
when
my
affair
with
this
girl
*NL*
was
first
discovered
.
''
--
``
Why
,
I
must
confess
,
''
says
Square
,
``
as
the
*NL*
matter
was
misrepresented
to
me
,
by
that
parson
Thwackum
,
I
might
*NL*
condemn
the
corruption
of
innocence
:
it
was
that
,
sir
,
it
was
*NL*
that
--
and
that
--
:
for
you
must
know
,
Mr
Jones
,
in
the
consideration
of
*NL*
fitness
,
very
minute
circumstances
,
sir
,
very
minute
circumstances
*NL*
cause
great
alteration
.
''
--
``
Well
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
be
that
as
it
will
,
it
*NL*
shall
be
your
own
fault
,
as
I
have
promised
you
,
if
you
ever
hear
any
*NL*
more
of
this
adventure
.
Behave
kindly
to
the
girl
,
and
I
will
never
*NL*
open
my
lips
concerning
the
matter
to
any
one
.
And
,
Molly
,
do
you
be
*NL*
faithful
to
your
friend
,
and
I
will
not
only
forgive
your
infidelity
*NL*
to
me
,
but
will
do
you
all
the
service
I
can
.
''
So
saying
,
he
took
a
*NL*
hasty
leave
,
and
,
slipping
down
the
ladder
,
retired
with
much
*NL*
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Square
was
rejoiced
to
find
this
adventure
was
likely
to
have
no
worse
*NL*
conclusion
;
and
as
for
Molly
,
being
recovered
from
her
confusion
,
she
*NL*
began
at
first
to
upbraid
Square
with
having
been
the
occasion
of
her
*NL*
loss
of
Jones
;
but
that
gentleman
soon
found
the
means
of
mitigating
*NL*
her
anger
,
partly
by
caresses
,
and
partly
by
a
small
nostrum
from
his
*NL*
purse
,
of
wonderful
and
approved
efficacy
in
purging
off
the
ill
*NL*
humours
of
the
mind
,
and
in
restoring
it
to
a
good
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
poured
forth
a
vast
profusion
of
tenderness
towards
her
new
*NL*
lover
;
turned
all
she
had
said
to
Jones
,
and
Jones
himself
,
into
*NL*
ridicule
;
and
vowed
,
though
he
once
had
the
possession
of
her
person
,
*NL*
that
none
but
Square
had
ever
been
master
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
comparing
which
with
the
former
,
the
reader
may
possibly
correct
*NL*
some
abuse
which
he
hath
formerly
been
guilty
of
in
the
application
of
*NL*
the
word
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
infidelity
of
Molly
,
which
Jones
had
now
discovered
,
would
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
have
vindicated
a
much
greater
degree
of
resentment
than
he
*NL*
expressed
on
the
occasion
;
and
if
he
had
abandoned
her
directly
from
*NL*
that
moment
,
very
few
,
I
believe
,
would
have
blamed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
,
however
,
it
is
,
that
he
saw
her
in
the
light
of
compassion
;
*NL*
and
though
his
love
to
her
was
not
of
that
kind
which
could
give
him
*NL*
any
great
uneasiness
at
her
inconstancy
,
yet
was
he
not
a
little
*NL*
shocked
on
reflecting
that
he
had
himself
originally
corrupted
her
*NL*
innocence
;
for
to
this
corruption
he
imputed
all
the
vice
into
which
*NL*
she
appeared
now
so
likely
to
plunge
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
consideration
gave
him
no
little
uneasiness
,
till
Betty
,
the
*NL*
elder
sister
,
was
so
kind
,
some
time
afterwards
,
entirely
to
cure
him
*NL*
by
a
hint
,
that
one
Will
Barnes
,
and
not
himself
,
had
been
the
first
*NL*
seducer
of
Molly
;
and
that
the
little
child
,
which
he
had
hitherto
so
*NL*
certainly
concluded
to
be
his
own
,
might
very
probably
have
an
equal
*NL*
title
,
at
least
,
to
claim
Barnes
for
its
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
eagerly
pursued
this
scent
when
he
had
first
received
it
;
and
in
*NL*
a
very
short
time
was
sufficiently
assured
that
the
girl
had
told
him
*NL*
truth
,
not
only
by
the
confession
of
the
fellow
,
but
at
last
by
that
*NL*
of
Molly
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Will
Barnes
was
a
country
gallant
,
and
had
acquired
as
many
*NL*
trophies
of
this
kind
as
any
ensign
or
attorney
's
clerk
in
the
*NL*
kingdom
.
He
had
,
indeed
,
reduced
several
women
to
a
state
of
utter
*NL*
profligacy
,
had
broke
the
hearts
of
some
,
and
had
the
honour
of
*NL*
occasioning
the
violent
death
of
one
poor
girl
,
who
had
either
drowned
*NL*
herself
,
or
,
what
was
rather
more
probable
,
had
been
drowned
by
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
of
his
conquests
,
this
fellow
had
triumphed
over
the
heart
*NL*
of
Betty
Seagrim
.
He
had
made
love
to
her
long
before
Molly
was
grown
*NL*
to
be
a
fit
object
of
that
pastime
;
but
had
afterwards
deserted
her
,
*NL*
and
applied
to
her
sister
,
with
whom
he
had
almost
immediate
success
.
*NL*
Now
Will
had
,
in
reality
,
the
sole
possession
of
Molly
's
affection
,
*NL*
while
Jones
and
Square
were
almost
equally
sacrifices
to
her
interest
*NL*
and
to
her
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
had
grown
that
implacable
hatred
which
we
have
before
seen
*NL*
raging
in
the
mind
of
Betty
;
though
we
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
*NL*
assign
this
cause
sooner
,
as
envy
itself
alone
was
adequate
to
all
the
*NL*
effects
we
have
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
become
perfectly
easy
by
possession
of
this
secret
with
*NL*
regard
to
Molly
;
but
as
to
Sophia
,
he
was
far
from
being
in
a
state
of
*NL*
tranquillity
;
nay
,
indeed
,
he
was
under
the
most
violent
perturbation
;
*NL*
his
heart
was
now
,
if
I
may
use
the
metaphor
,
entirely
evacuated
,
and
*NL*
Sophia
took
absolute
possession
of
it
.
He
loved
her
with
an
unbounded
*NL*
passion
,
and
plainly
saw
the
tender
sentiments
she
had
for
him
;
yet
*NL*
could
not
this
assurance
lessen
his
despair
of
obtaining
the
consent
*NL*
of
her
father
,
nor
the
horrors
which
attended
his
pursuit
of
her
by
*NL*
any
base
or
treacherous
method
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
injury
which
he
must
thus
do
to
Mr
Western
,
and
the
concern
which
*NL*
would
accrue
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
were
circumstances
that
tormented
him
*NL*
all
day
,
and
haunted
him
on
his
pillow
at
night
.
His
life
was
a
*NL*
constant
struggle
between
honour
and
inclination
,
which
alternately
*NL*
triumphed
over
each
other
in
his
mind
.
He
often
resolved
,
in
the
*NL*
absence
of
Sophia
,
to
leave
her
father
's
house
,
and
to
see
her
no
*NL*
more
;
and
as
often
,
in
her
presence
,
forgot
all
those
resolutions
,
and
*NL*
determined
to
pursue
her
at
the
hazard
of
his
life
,
and
at
the
*NL*
forfeiture
of
what
was
much
dearer
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
conflict
began
soon
to
produce
very
strong
and
visible
effects
:
*NL*
for
he
lost
all
his
usual
sprightliness
and
gaiety
of
temper
,
and
*NL*
became
not
only
melancholy
when
alone
,
but
dejected
and
absent
in
*NL*
company
;
nay
,
if
ever
he
put
on
a
forced
mirth
,
to
comply
with
Mr
*NL*
Western
's
humour
,
the
constraint
appeared
so
plain
,
that
he
seemed
to
*NL*
have
been
giving
the
strongest
evidence
of
what
he
endeavoured
to
*NL*
conceal
by
such
ostentation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
a
question
,
whether
the
art
which
he
used
to
*NL*
conceal
his
passion
,
or
the
means
which
honest
nature
employed
to
*NL*
reveal
it
,
betrayed
him
most
:
for
while
art
made
him
more
than
ever
*NL*
reserved
to
Sophia
,
and
forbad
him
to
address
any
of
his
discourse
to
*NL*
her
,
nay
,
to
avoid
meeting
her
eyes
,
with
the
utmost
caution
;
nature
*NL*
was
no
less
busy
in
counterplotting
him
.
Hence
,
at
the
approach
of
the
*NL*
young
lady
,
he
grew
pale
;
and
if
this
was
sudden
,
started
.
If
his
eyes
*NL*
accidentally
met
hers
,
the
blood
rushed
into
his
cheeks
,
and
his
*NL*
countenance
became
all
over
scarlet
.
If
common
civility
ever
obliged
*NL*
him
to
speak
to
her
,
as
to
drink
her
health
at
table
,
his
tongue
was
*NL*
sure
to
falter
.
If
he
touched
her
,
his
hand
,
nay
his
whole
frame
,
*NL*
trembled
.
And
if
any
discourse
tended
,
however
remotely
,
to
raise
the
*NL*
idea
of
love
,
an
involuntary
sigh
seldom
failed
to
steal
from
his
*NL*
bosom
.
Most
of
which
accidents
nature
was
wonderfully
industrious
to
*NL*
throw
daily
in
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
symptoms
escaped
the
notice
of
the
squire
:
but
not
so
of
*NL*
Sophia
.
She
soon
perceived
these
agitations
of
mind
in
Jones
,
and
was
*NL*
at
no
loss
to
discover
the
cause
;
for
indeed
she
recognized
it
in
her
*NL*
own
breast
.
And
this
recognition
is
,
I
suppose
,
that
sympathy
which
*NL*
hath
been
so
often
noted
in
lovers
,
and
which
will
sufficiently
*NL*
account
for
her
being
so
much
quicker-sighted
than
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
to
say
the
truth
,
there
is
a
more
simple
and
plain
method
of
*NL*
accounting
for
that
prodigious
superiority
of
penetration
which
we
*NL*
must
observe
in
some
men
over
the
rest
of
the
human
species
,
and
one
*NL*
which
will
serve
not
only
in
the
case
of
lovers
,
but
of
all
others
.
*NL*
From
whence
is
it
that
the
knave
is
generally
so
quick-sighted
to
*NL*
those
symptoms
and
operations
of
knavery
,
which
often
dupe
an
honest
*NL*
man
of
a
much
better
understanding
?
There
surely
is
no
general
*NL*
sympathy
among
knaves
;
nor
have
they
,
like
freemasons
,
any
common
sign
*NL*
of
communication
.
In
reality
,
it
is
only
because
they
have
the
same
*NL*
thing
in
their
heads
,
and
their
thoughts
are
turned
the
same
way
.
*NL*
Thus
,
that
Sophia
saw
,
and
that
Western
did
not
see
,
the
plain
*NL*
symptoms
of
love
in
Jones
can
be
no
wonder
,
when
we
consider
that
the
*NL*
idea
of
love
never
entered
into
the
head
of
the
father
,
whereas
the
*NL*
daughter
,
at
present
,
thought
of
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Sophia
was
well
satisfied
of
the
violent
passion
which
tormented
*NL*
poor
Jones
,
and
no
less
certain
that
she
herself
was
its
object
,
she
*NL*
had
not
the
least
difficulty
in
discovering
the
true
cause
of
his
*NL*
present
behaviour
.
This
highly
endeared
him
to
her
,
and
raised
in
her
*NL*
mind
two
of
the
best
affections
which
any
lover
can
wish
to
raise
in
a
*NL*
mistress
--
these
were
,
esteem
and
pity
--
for
sure
the
most
outrageously
*NL*
rigid
among
her
sex
will
excuse
her
pitying
a
man
whom
she
saw
*NL*
miserable
on
her
own
account
;
nor
can
they
blame
her
for
esteeming
one
*NL*
who
visibly
,
from
the
most
honourable
motives
,
endeavoured
to
smother
*NL*
a
flame
in
his
own
bosom
,
which
,
like
the
famous
Spartan
theft
,
was
*NL*
preying
upon
and
consuming
his
very
vitals
.
Thus
his
backwardness
,
his
*NL*
shunning
her
,
his
coldness
,
and
his
silence
,
were
the
forwardest
,
the
*NL*
most
diligent
,
the
warmest
,
and
most
eloquent
advocates
;
and
wrought
*NL*
so
violently
on
her
sensible
and
tender
heart
,
that
she
soon
felt
for
*NL*
him
all
those
gentle
sensations
which
are
consistent
with
a
virtuous
*NL*
and
elevated
female
mind
.
In
short
,
all
which
esteem
,
gratitude
,
and
*NL*
pity
,
can
inspire
in
such
towards
an
agreeable
man
--
indeed
,
all
which
*NL*
the
nicest
delicacy
can
allow
.
In
a
word
,
she
was
in
love
with
him
to
*NL*
distraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
this
young
couple
accidentally
met
in
the
garden
,
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
two
walks
which
were
both
bounded
by
that
canal
in
which
Jones
*NL*
had
formerly
risqued
drowning
to
retrieve
the
little
bird
that
Sophia
*NL*
had
there
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
place
had
been
of
late
much
frequented
by
Sophia
.
Here
she
used
*NL*
to
ruminate
,
with
a
mixture
of
pain
and
pleasure
,
on
an
incident
*NL*
which
,
however
trifling
in
itself
,
had
possibly
sown
the
first
seeds
*NL*
of
that
affection
which
was
now
arrived
to
such
maturity
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
then
this
young
couple
met
.
They
were
almost
close
together
*NL*
before
either
of
them
knew
anything
of
the
other
's
approach
.
A
*NL*
bystander
would
have
discovered
sufficient
marks
of
confusion
in
the
*NL*
countenance
of
each
;
but
they
felt
too
much
themselves
to
make
any
*NL*
observation
.
As
soon
as
Jones
had
a
little
recovered
his
first
*NL*
surprize
,
he
accosted
the
young
lady
with
some
of
the
ordinary
forms
*NL*
of
salutation
,
which
she
in
the
same
manner
returned
;
and
their
*NL*
conversation
began
,
as
usual
,
on
the
delicious
beauty
of
the
morning
.
*NL*
Hence
they
past
to
the
beauty
of
the
place
,
on
which
Jones
launched
*NL*
forth
very
high
encomiums
.
When
they
came
to
the
tree
whence
he
had
*NL*
formerly
tumbled
into
the
canal
,
Sophia
could
not
help
reminding
him
*NL*
of
that
accident
,
and
said
,
``
I
fancy
,
Mr
Jones
,
you
have
some
little
*NL*
shuddering
when
you
see
that
water
.
''
--
``
I
assure
you
,
madam
,
''
answered
*NL*
Jones
,
``
the
concern
you
felt
at
the
loss
of
your
little
bird
will
*NL*
always
appear
to
me
the
highest
circumstance
in
that
adventure
.
Poor
*NL*
little
Tommy
!
there
is
the
branch
he
stood
upon
.
How
could
the
little
*NL*
wretch
have
the
folly
to
fly
away
from
that
state
of
happiness
in
*NL*
which
I
had
the
honour
to
place
him
?
His
fate
was
a
just
punishment
*NL*
for
his
ingratitude
.
''
--
``
Upon
my
word
,
Mr
Jones
,
''
said
she
,
``
your
*NL*
gallantry
very
narrowly
escaped
as
severe
a
fate
.
Sure
the
remembrance
*NL*
must
affect
you
.
''
--
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
answered
he
,
``
if
I
have
any
reason
*NL*
to
reflect
with
sorrow
on
it
,
it
is
,
perhaps
,
that
the
water
had
not
*NL*
been
a
little
deeper
,
by
which
I
might
have
escaped
many
bitter
*NL*
heart-aches
that
Fortune
seems
to
have
in
store
for
me
.
''
--
``
Fie
,
Mr
*NL*
Jones
!
''
replied
Sophia
;
``
I
am
sure
you
can
not
be
in
earnest
now
.
This
*NL*
affected
contempt
of
life
is
only
an
excess
of
your
complacence
to
me
.
*NL*
You
would
endeavour
to
lessen
the
obligation
of
having
twice
ventured
*NL*
it
for
my
sake
.
Beware
the
third
time
.
''
She
spoke
these
last
words
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
and
a
softness
inexpressible
.
Jones
answered
with
a
*NL*
sigh
,
``
He
feared
it
was
already
too
late
for
caution
:
''
and
then
*NL*
looking
tenderly
and
stedfastly
on
her
,
he
cried
,
``
Oh
,
Miss
Western
!
*NL*
can
you
desire
me
to
live
?
Can
you
wish
me
so
ill
?
''
Sophia
,
looking
*NL*
down
on
the
ground
,
answered
with
some
hesitation
,
``
Indeed
,
Mr
Jones
,
*NL*
I
do
not
wish
you
ill
.
''
--
``
Oh
,
I
know
too
well
that
heavenly
temper
,
''
*NL*
cries
Jones
,
``
that
divine
goodness
,
which
is
beyond
every
other
*NL*
charm
.
''
--
``
Nay
,
now
,
''
answered
she
,
``
I
understand
you
not
.
I
can
stay
*NL*
no
longer
.
''
--
``
I
--
I
would
not
be
understood
!
''
cries
he
;
``
nay
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
be
understood
.
I
know
not
what
I
say
.
Meeting
you
here
so
*NL*
unexpectedly
,
I
have
been
unguarded
:
for
Heaven
's
sake
pardon
me
,
if
I
*NL*
have
said
anything
to
offend
you
.
I
did
not
mean
it
.
Indeed
,
I
would
*NL*
rather
have
died
--
nay
,
the
very
thought
would
kill
me
.
''
--
``
You
surprize
*NL*
me
,
''
answered
she
.
``
How
can
you
possibly
think
you
have
offended
*NL*
me
?
''
--
``
Fear
,
madam
,
''
says
he
,
``
easily
runs
into
madness
;
and
there
is
*NL*
no
degree
of
fear
like
that
which
I
feel
of
offending
you
.
How
can
I
*NL*
speak
then
?
Nay
,
do
n't
look
angrily
at
me
:
one
frown
will
destroy
me
.
*NL*
I
mean
nothing
.
Blame
my
eyes
,
or
blame
those
beauties
.
What
am
I
*NL*
saying
?
Pardon
me
if
I
have
said
too
much
.
My
heart
overflowed
.
I
have
*NL*
struggled
with
my
love
to
the
utmost
,
and
have
endeavoured
to
conceal
*NL*
a
fever
which
preys
on
my
vitals
,
and
will
,
I
hope
,
soon
make
it
*NL*
impossible
for
me
ever
to
offend
you
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
now
fell
a
trembling
as
if
he
had
been
shaken
with
the
fit
of
*NL*
an
ague
.
Sophia
,
who
was
in
a
situation
not
very
different
from
his
,
*NL*
answered
in
these
words
:
``
Mr
Jones
,
I
will
not
affect
to
misunderstand
*NL*
you
;
indeed
,
I
understand
you
too
well
;
but
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
if
you
*NL*
have
any
affection
for
me
,
let
me
make
the
best
of
my
way
into
the
*NL*
house
.
I
wish
I
may
be
able
to
support
myself
thither
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
who
was
hardly
able
to
support
himself
,
offered
her
his
arm
,
*NL*
which
she
condescended
to
accept
,
but
begged
he
would
not
mention
a
*NL*
word
more
to
her
of
this
nature
at
present
.
He
promised
he
would
not
;
*NL*
insisting
only
on
her
forgiveness
of
what
love
,
without
the
leave
of
*NL*
his
will
,
had
forced
from
him
:
this
,
she
told
him
,
he
knew
how
to
*NL*
obtain
by
his
future
behaviour
;
and
thus
this
young
pair
tottered
and
*NL*
trembled
along
,
the
lover
not
once
daring
to
squeeze
the
hand
of
his
*NL*
mistress
,
though
it
was
locked
in
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
immediately
retired
to
her
chamber
,
where
Mrs
Honour
and
the
*NL*
hartshorn
were
summoned
to
her
assistance
.
As
to
poor
Jones
,
the
only
*NL*
relief
to
his
distempered
mind
was
an
unwelcome
piece
of
news
,
which
,
*NL*
as
it
opens
a
scene
of
different
nature
from
those
in
which
the
reader
*NL*
hath
lately
been
conversant
,
will
be
communicated
to
him
in
the
next
*NL*
chapter
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
Mr
Allworthy
appears
on
a
sick-bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
was
become
so
fond
of
Jones
that
he
was
unwilling
to
part
*NL*
with
him
,
though
his
arm
had
been
long
since
cured
;
and
Jones
,
either
*NL*
from
the
love
of
sport
,
or
from
some
other
reason
,
was
easily
*NL*
persuaded
to
continue
at
his
house
,
which
he
did
sometimes
for
a
*NL*
fortnight
together
without
paying
a
single
visit
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
;
*NL*
nay
,
without
ever
hearing
from
thence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
had
been
for
some
days
indisposed
with
a
cold
,
which
had
*NL*
been
attended
with
a
little
fever
.
This
he
had
,
however
,
neglected
;
as
*NL*
it
was
usual
with
him
to
do
all
manner
of
disorders
which
did
not
*NL*
confine
him
to
his
bed
,
or
prevent
his
several
faculties
from
*NL*
performing
their
ordinary
functions
;
--
a
conduct
which
we
would
by
no
*NL*
means
be
thought
to
approve
or
recommend
to
imitation
;
for
surely
the
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
Aesculapian
art
are
in
the
right
in
advising
,
that
*NL*
the
moment
the
disease
has
entered
at
one
door
,
the
physician
should
*NL*
be
introduced
at
the
other
:
what
else
is
meant
by
that
old
adage
,
*NL*
_
Venienti
occurrite
morbo
?
_
``
Oppose
a
distemper
at
its
first
*NL*
approach
.
''
Thus
the
doctor
and
the
disease
meet
in
fair
and
equal
*NL*
conflict
;
whereas
,
by
giving
time
to
the
latter
,
we
often
suffer
him
*NL*
to
fortify
and
entrench
himself
,
like
a
French
army
;
so
that
the
*NL*
learned
gentleman
finds
it
very
difficult
,
and
sometimes
impossible
,
*NL*
to
come
at
the
enemy
.
Nay
,
sometimes
by
gaining
time
the
disease
*NL*
applies
to
the
French
military
politics
,
and
corrupts
nature
over
to
*NL*
his
side
,
and
then
all
the
powers
of
physic
must
arrive
too
late
.
*NL*
Agreeable
to
these
observations
was
,
I
remember
,
the
complaint
of
the
*NL*
great
Doctor
Misaubin
,
who
used
very
pathetically
to
lament
the
late
*NL*
applications
which
were
made
to
his
skill
,
saying
,
``
Bygar
,

believe
*NL*
my

me
for
de
undertaker
,
for

never
send

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
's
distemper
,
by
means
of
this
neglect
,
gained
such
*NL*
ground
,
that
,
when
the
increase
of
his
fever
obliged
him
to
send
for
*NL*
assistance
,
the
doctor
at
his
first
arrival
shook
his
head
,
wished
he
*NL*
had
been
sent
for
sooner
,
and
intimated
that
he
thought
him
in
very
*NL*
imminent
danger
.
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
had
settled
all
his
affairs
in
this
*NL*
world
,
and
was
as
well
prepared
as
it
is
possible
for
human
nature
to
*NL*
be
for
the
other
,
received
this
information
with
the
utmost
calmness
*NL*
and
unconcern
.
He
could
,
indeed
,
whenever
he
laid
himself
down
to
*NL*
rest
,
say
with
Cato
in
the
tragical
poem
--
*NL*
*NL*
Let
guilt
or
fear
*NL*
Disturb
man
's
rest
:
Cato
knows
neither
of
them
;
*NL*
Indifferent
in
his
choice
to
sleep
or
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reality
,
he
could
say
this
with
ten
times
more
reason
and
*NL*
confidence
than
Cato
,
or
any
other
proud
fellow
among
the
antient
or
*NL*
modern
heroes
;
for
he
was
not
only
devoid
of
fear
,
but
might
be
*NL*
considered
as
a
faithful
labourer
,
when
at
the
end
of
harvest
he
is
*NL*
summoned
to
receive
his
reward
at
the
hands
of
a
bountiful
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
man
gave
immediate
orders
for
all
his
family
to
be
summoned
*NL*
round
him
.
None
of
these
were
then
abroad
,
but
Mrs
Blifil
,
who
had
*NL*
been
some
time
in
London
,
and
Mr
Jones
,
whom
the
reader
hath
just
*NL*
parted
from
at
Mr
Western
's
,
and
who
received
this
summons
just
as
*NL*
Sophia
had
left
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
danger
-LRB-
for
the
servant
told
him
he
was
*NL*
dying
-RRB-
drove
all
thoughts
of
love
out
of
his
head
.
He
hurried
*NL*
instantly
into
the
chariot
which
was
sent
for
him
,
and
ordered
the
*NL*
coachman
to
drive
with
all
imaginable
haste
;
nor
did
the
idea
of
*NL*
Sophia
,
I
believe
,
once
occur
to
him
on
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
whole
family
,
namely
,
Mr
Blifil
,
Mr
Jones
,
Mr
Thwackum
,
Mr
*NL*
Square
,
and
some
of
the
servants
-LRB-
for
such
were
Mr
Allworthy
's
orders
-RRB-
*NL*
being
all
assembled
round
his
bed
,
the
good
man
sat
up
in
it
,
and
was
*NL*
beginning
to
speak
,
when
Blifil
fell
to
blubbering
,
and
began
to
*NL*
express
very
loud
and
bitter
lamentations
.
Upon
this
Mr
Allworthy
*NL*
shook
him
by
the
hand
,
and
said
,
``
Do
not
sorrow
thus
,
my
dear
nephew
,
*NL*
at
the
most
ordinary
of
all
human
occurrences
.
When
misfortunes
befal
*NL*
our
friends
we
are
justly
grieved
;
for
those
are
accidents
which
might
*NL*
often
have
been
avoided
,
and
which
may
seem
to
render
the
lot
of
one
*NL*
man
more
peculiarly
unhappy
than
that
of
others
;
but
death
is
*NL*
certainly
unavoidable
,
and
is
that
common
lot
in
which
alone
the
*NL*
fortunes
of
all
men
agree
:
nor
is
the
time
when
this
happens
to
us
*NL*
very
material
.
If
the
wisest
of
men
hath
compared
life
to
a
span
,
*NL*
surely
we
may
be
allowed
to
consider
it
as
a
day
.
It
is
my
fate
to
*NL*
leave
it
in
the
evening
;
but
those
who
are
taken
away
earlier
have
*NL*
only
lost
a
few
hours
,
at
the
best
little
worth
lamenting
,
and
much
*NL*
oftener
hours
of
labour
and
fatigue
,
of
pain
and
sorrow
.
One
of
the
*NL*
Roman
poets
,
I
remember
,
likens
our
leaving
life
to
our
departure
from
*NL*
a
feast
;
--
a
thought
which
hath
often
occurred
to
me
when
I
have
seen
*NL*
men
struggling
to
protract
an
entertainment
,
and
to
enjoy
the
company
*NL*
of
their
friends
a
few
moments
longer
.
Alas
!
how
short
is
the
most
*NL*
protracted
of
such
enjoyments
!
how
immaterial
the
difference
between
*NL*
him
who
retires
the
soonest
,
and
him
who
stays
the
latest
!
This
is
*NL*
seeing
life
in
the
best
view
,
and
this
unwillingness
to
quit
our
*NL*
friends
is
the
most
amiable
motive
from
which
we
can
derive
the
fear
*NL*
of
death
;
and
yet
the
longest
enjoyment
which
we
can
hope
for
of
this
*NL*
kind
is
of
so
trivial
a
duration
,
that
it
is
to
a
wise
man
truly
*NL*
contemptible
.
Few
men
,
I
own
,
think
in
this
manner
;
for
,
indeed
,
few
*NL*
men
think
of
death
till
they
are
in
its
jaws
.
However
gigantic
and
*NL*
terrible
an
object
this
may
appear
when
it
approaches
them
,
they
are
*NL*
nevertheless
incapable
of
seeing
it
at
any
distance
;
nay
,
though
they
*NL*
have
been
ever
so
much
alarmed
and
frightened
when
they
have
*NL*
apprehended
themselves
in
danger
of
dying
,
they
are
no
sooner
cleared
*NL*
from
this
apprehension
than
even
the
fears
of
it
are
erased
from
their
*NL*
minds
.
But
,
alas
!
he
who
escapes
from
death
is
not
pardoned
;
he
is
*NL*
only
reprieved
,
and
reprieved
to
a
short
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grieve
,
therefore
,
no
more
,
my
dear
child
,
on
this
occasion
:
an
event
*NL*
which
may
happen
every
hour
;
which
every
element
,
nay
,
almost
every
*NL*
particle
of
matter
that
surrounds
us
is
capable
of
producing

you

this
our
parting

my

I
have
settled
long

I
think

proper

have
the
comfort

made

Nephew

leave
you

my
whole

L500

is
to
revert

The

Mr

as
I
*NL*
know
the
inconvenience
which
attends
the
want
of
ready
money
,
I
have

added
L1000
in
specie

In
this
I
know
not
whether
I
have
exceeded

fallen
short

your
expectation

Perhaps
you
will
think
I

too
little

be

I
despise

I
have

often
heard
in

pleaded
as

total
want

instead

raising
gratitude

*NL*
Jones
flung
himself
at
his
benefactor

feet
,
and
taking
eagerly
hold
*NL*
of
his
hand
,
assured
him
his
goodness
to
him
,
both
now
and
all
other
*NL*
times

had
so
infinitely
exceeded
not
only
his
merit
but
his
hopes

*NL*
that
no
words
could
express
his
sense
of
it
.
``
And
I
assure
you

*NL*
said
he
,
``
your
present
generosity

Here
*NL*
his
words
choaked
him
,
and
he
turned
away
to
hide
a
tear
which
was
*NL*
starting
from
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
then
gently
squeezed
his
hand
,
and
proceeded
thus
:
``

convinced

my

you
have
much
goodness

generosity

honour

in
your
temper
:
if
you
will
add
prudence
and
religion
to
*NL*
these
,
you
must
be
happy
;
for
the
three
former
qualities
,
I
admit
,
*NL*
make
you
worthy
of
happiness
,
but
they
are
the
latter
only
which
will
*NL*
put
you
in
possession
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thousand
pound
I
have
given
to
you

Mr
Thwackum

a
sum
I
am
*NL*
convinced
which
greatly
exceeds
your
desires
,
as
well
as
your
wants
.
*NL*
However
,
you
will
receive
it
as
a
memorial
of
my
friendship
;
and
*NL*
whatever
superfluities
may
redound
to
you
,
that
piety
which
you
so

rigidly
maintain

instruct
you

will

enable
you
to
pursue
your
profession
with
better
success
than
*NL*
hitherto

I
have
often
observed
with
concern
,
that
distress
is
more
*NL*
apt
to
excite
contempt
than
commiseration
,
especially
among
men
of
*NL*
business
,
with
whom
poverty
is
understood
to
indicate
want
of
ability

*NL*
But
the
little
I
have
been
able
to
leave
you
will
extricate
you
from
*NL*
those
difficulties
with
which
you
have
formerly
struggled
;
and
then
I
*NL*
doubt
not
but
you
will
meet
with
sufficient
prosperity
to
supply
what

a
man
of
your
philosophical
temper
will
require

find
myself
growing
faint

My

will
there
find
some
tokens
to

remember
me
by
;

there
are
a
few
charities

,
I
trust
,
my

executors
will
see
faithfully
performed

out

*NL*
Here
a
footman
came
hastily
into
the
room
,
and
said
there
was
an
*NL*
attorney
from
Salisbury
who
had
a
particular
message
,
which
he
said
he
*NL*
must
communicate
to
Mr
Allworthy
himself
:
that
he
seemed
in
a
violent
*NL*
hurry
,
and
protested
he
had
so
much
business
to
do
,
that
,
if
he
could
*NL*
cut
himself
into
four
quarters
,
all
would
not
be
sufficient
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
child
,
''
said
Allworthy
to
Blifil
,
``
see
what
the
gentleman
wants
.
*NL*
I
am
not
able
to
do
any
business
now
,
nor
can
he
have
any
with
me
,
in
*NL*
which
you
are
not
at
present
more
concerned
than
myself
.
Besides
,
I
*NL*
really
am
--
I
am
incapable
of
seeing
any
one
at
present
,
or
of
any
*NL*
longer
attention
.
''
He
then
saluted
them
all
,
saying
,
perhaps
he
should
*NL*
be
able
to
see
them
again
,
but
he
should
be
now
glad
to
compose
*NL*
himself
a
little
,
finding
that
he
had
too
much
exhausted
his
spirits
*NL*
in
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
company
shed
tears
at
their
parting
;
and
even
the
*NL*
philosopher
Square
wiped
his
eyes
,
albeit
unused
to
the
melting
mood
.
*NL*
As
to
Mrs
Wilkins
,
she
dropt
her
pearls
as
fast
as
the
Arabian
trees
*NL*
their
medicinal
gums
;
for
this
was
a
ceremonial
which
that
gentlewoman
*NL*
never
omitted
on
a
proper
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
Mr
Allworthy
again
laid
himself
down
on
his
pillow
,
and
*NL*
endeavoured
to
compose
himself
to
rest

Besides
grief
for

there
was
another

for
that
briny

stream
which
so
plentifully
rose
above
the
two
mountainous
cheek-bones
*NL*
of

She
was
no

retired

she
began
to

mutter
to
herself
in
the
following
pleasant
strain
:
``
Sure
master
might
*NL*
have
made
some
difference
,
methinks
,
between
me
and
the
other
*NL*
servants
.
I
suppose
he
hath
left
me
mourning
;
but
,
i
`
fackins
!
if
that
*NL*
be
all
,
the
devil
shall
wear
it
for
him
,
for
me
.
I
'd
have
his
worship
*NL*
know
I
am
no
beggar
.
I
have
saved
five
hundred
pound
in
his
service
,
*NL*
and
after
all
to
be
used
in
this
manner
.
--
It
is
a
fine
encouragement
*NL*
to
servants
to
be
honest
;
and
to
be
sure
,
if
I
have
taken
a
little
*NL*
something
now
and
then
,
others
have
taken
ten
times
as
much
;
and
now
*NL*
we
are
all
put
in
a
lump
together
.
If
so
be
that
it
be
so
,
the
legacy
*NL*
may
go
to
the
devil
with
him
that
gave
it
.
No
,
I
wo
n't
give
it
up
*NL*
neither
,
because
that
will
please
some
folks
.
No
,
I
'll
buy
the
gayest
*NL*
gown
I
can
get
,
and
dance
over
the
old
curmudgeon
's
grave
in
it
.
This
*NL*
is
my
reward
for
taking
his
part
so
often
,
when
all
the
country
have
*NL*
cried
shame
of
him
,
for
breeding
up
his
bastard
in
that
manner
;
but
he
*NL*
is
going
now
where
he
must
pay
for
all
.
It
would
have
become
him
*NL*
better
to
have
repented
of
his
sins
on
his
deathbed
,
than
to
glory
in
*NL*
them
,
and
give
away
his
estate
out
of
his
own
family
to
a
misbegotten
*NL*
child
.
Found
in
his
bed
,
forsooth
!
a
pretty
story
!
ay
,
ay
,
those
that
*NL*
hide
know
where
to
find
.
Lord
forgive
him
!
I
warrant
he
hath
many
more
*NL*
bastards
to
answer
for
,
if
the
truth
was
known
.
One
comfort
is
,
they
*NL*
will
all
be
known
where
he
is
a
going
now
.
--
`
The
servants
will
find
*NL*
some
token
to
remember
me
by
.
'
Those
were
the
very
words
;
I
shall
*NL*
never
forget
them
,
if
I
was
to
live
a
thousand
years
.
Ay
,
ay
,
I
shall
*NL*
remember
you
for
huddling
me
among
the
servants
.
One
would
have
*NL*
thought
he
might
have
mentioned
my
name
as
well
as
that
of
Square
;
but
*NL*
he
is
a
gentleman
forsooth
,
though
he
had
not
cloths
on
his
back
when
*NL*
he
came
hither
first
.
Marry
come
up
with
such
gentlemen
!
though
he
*NL*
hath
lived
here
this
many
years
,
I
do
n't
believe
there
is
arrow
a
*NL*
servant
in
the
house
ever
saw
the
colour
of
his
money
.
The
devil
shall
*NL*
wait
upon
such
a
gentleman
for
me
.
''
Much
more
of
the
like
kind
she
*NL*
muttered
to
herself
;
but
this
taste
shall
suffice
to
the
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
Thwackum
nor
Square
were
much
better
satisfied
with
their
*NL*
legacies
.
Though
they
breathed
not
their
resentment
so
loud
,
yet
from
*NL*
the
discontent
which
appeared
in
their
countenances
,
as
well
as
from
*NL*
the
following
dialogue
,
we
collect
that
no
great
pleasure
reigned
in
*NL*
their
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
an
hour
after
they
had
left
the
sick-room
,
Square
met
Thwackum
*NL*
in
the
hall
and
accosted
him
thus
:
``
Well
,
sir
,
have
you
heard
any
news
*NL*
of
your
friend
since
we
parted
from
him
?
''
--
``
If
you
mean
Mr
Allworthy
,
''
*NL*
answered
Thwackum
,
``
I
think
you
might
rather
give
him
the
appellation
*NL*
of
your
friend
;
for
he
seems
to
me
to
have
deserved
that
title
.
''
--
``
The
*NL*
title
is
as
good
on
your
side
,
''
replied
Square
,
``
for
his
bounty
,
such
*NL*
as
it
is
,
hath
been
equal
to
both
.
''
--
``
I
should
not
have
mentioned
it
*NL*
first
,
''
cries
Thwackum
,
``
but
since
you
begin
,
I
must
inform
you
I
am
*NL*
of
a
different
opinion
.
There
is
a
wide
distinction
between
voluntary
*NL*
favours
and
rewards
.
The
duty
I
have
done
in
his
family
,
and
the
care
*NL*
I
have
taken
in
the
education
of
his
two
boys
,
are
services
for
which
*NL*
some
men
might
have
expected
a
greater
return
.
I
would
not
have
you
*NL*
imagine
I
am
therefore
dissatisfied
;
for
St
Paul
hath
taught
me
to
*NL*
be
content
with
the
little
I
have
.
Had
the
modicum
been
less
,
I
*NL*
should
have
known
my
duty
.
But
though
the
Scriptures
obliges
me
to
*NL*
remain
contented
,
it
doth
not
enjoin
me
to
shut
my
eyes
to
my
own
*NL*
merit
,
nor
restrain
me
from
seeing
when
I
am
injured
by
an
unjust
*NL*
comparison
.
''
--
``
Since
you
provoke
me
,
''
returned
Square
,
``
that
injury
is
*NL*
done
to
me
;
nor
did
I
ever
imagine
Mr
Allworthy
had
held
my
friendship
*NL*
so
light
,
as
to
put
me
in
balance
with
one
who
received
his
wages
.
I
*NL*
know
to
what
it
is
owing
;
it
proceeds
from
those
narrow
principles
*NL*
which
you
have
been
so
long
endeavouring
to
infuse
into
him
,
in
*NL*
contempt
of
everything
which
is
great
and
noble
.
The
beauty
and
*NL*
loveliness
of
friendship
is
too
strong
for
dim
eyes
,
nor
can
it
be
*NL*
perceived
by
any
other
medium
than
that
unerring
rule
of
right
,
which
*NL*
you
have
so
often
endeavoured
to
ridicule
,
that
you
have
perverted
*NL*
your
friend
's
understanding
.
''
--
``
I
wish
,
''
cries
Thwackum
,
in
a
rage
,
``
I
*NL*
wish
,
for
the
sake
of
his
soul
,
your
damnable
doctrines
have
not
*NL*
perverted
his
faith
.
It
is
to
this
I
impute
his
present
behaviour
,
so
*NL*
unbecoming
a
Christian
.
Who
but
an
atheist
could
think
of
leaving
the
*NL*
world
without
having
first
made
up
his
account
?
without
confessing
his
*NL*
sins
,
and
receiving
that
absolution
which
he
knew
he
had
one
in
the
*NL*
house
duly
authorized
to
give
him
?
He
will
feel
the
want
of
these
*NL*
necessaries
when
it
is
too
late
,
when
he
is
arrived
at
that
place
*NL*
where
there
is
wailing
and
gnashing
of
teeth
.
It
is
then
he
will
find
*NL*
in
what
mighty
stead
that
heathen
goddess
,
that
virtue
,
which
you
and
*NL*
all
other
deists
of
the
age
adore
,
will
stand
him
.
He
will
then
summon
*NL*
his
priest
,
when
there
is
none
to
be
found
,
and
will
lament
the
want
*NL*
of
that
absolution
,
without
which
no
sinner
can
be
safe
.
''
--
``
If
it
be
*NL*
so
material
,
''
says
Square
,
``
why
do
n't
you
present
it
him
of
your
own
*NL*
accord
?
''
``
It
hath
no
virtue
,
''
cries
Thwackum
,
``
but
to
those
who
have
*NL*
sufficient
grace
to
require
it
.
But
why
do
I
talk
thus
to
a
heathen
*NL*
and
an
unbeliever
?
It
is
you
that
taught
him
this
lesson
,
for
which
*NL*
you
have
been
well
rewarded
in
this
world
,
as
I
doubt
not
your
*NL*
disciple
will
soon
be
in
the
other
.
''
--
``
I
know
not
what
you
mean
by
*NL*
reward
,
''
said
Square
;
``
but
if
you
hint
at
that
pitiful
memorial
of
our
*NL*
friendship
,
which
he
hath
thought
fit
to
bequeath
me
,
I
despise
it
;
*NL*
and
nothing
but
the
unfortunate
situation
of
my
circumstances
should
*NL*
prevail
on
me
to
accept
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
physician
now
arrived
,
and
began
to
inquire
of
the
two
disputants
,
*NL*
how
we
all
did
above-stairs
?
``
In
a
miserable
way
,
''
answered
Thwackum
.
*NL*
``
It
is
no
more
than
I
expected
,
''
cries
the
doctor
:
``
but
pray
what
*NL*
symptoms
have
appeared
since
I
left
you
?
''
--
``
No
good
ones
,
I
am
*NL*
afraid
,
''
replied
Thwackum
:
``
after
what
past
at
our
departure
,
I
think
*NL*
there
were
little
hopes
.
''
The
bodily
physician
,
perhaps
,
misunderstood
*NL*
the
curer
of
souls
;
and
before
they
came
to
an
explanation
,
Mr
Blifil
*NL*
came
to
them
with
a
most
melancholy
countenance
,
and
acquainted
them
*NL*
that
he
brought
sad
news
,
that
his
mother
was
dead
at
Salisbury
;
that
*NL*
she
had
been
seized
on
the
road
home
with
the
gout
in
her
head
and
*NL*
stomach
,
which
had
carried
her
off
in
a
few
hours
.
``
Good-lack-a-day
!
''
*NL*
says
the
doctor
.
``
One
can
not
answer
for
events
;
but
I
wish
I
had
been
*NL*
at
hand
,
to
have
been
called
in
.
The
gout
is
a
distemper
which
it
is
*NL*
difficult
to
treat
;
yet
I
have
been
remarkably
successful
in
it
.
''
*NL*
Thwackum
and
Square
both
condoled
with
Mr
Blifil
for
the
loss
of
his
*NL*
mother
,
which
the
one
advised
him
to
bear
like
a
man
,
and
the
other
*NL*
like
a
Christian
.
The
young
gentleman
said
he
knew
very
well
we
were
*NL*
all
mortal
,
and
he
would
endeavour
to
submit
to
his
loss
as
well
as
he
*NL*
could
.
That
he
could
not
,
however
,
help
complaining
a
little
against
*NL*
the
peculiar
severity
of
his
fate
,
which
brought
the
news
of
so
great
*NL*
a
calamity
to
him
by
surprize
,
and
that
at
a
time
when
he
hourly
*NL*
expected
the
severest
blow
he
was
capable
of
feeling
from
the
malice
*NL*
of
fortune
.
He
said
,
the
present
occasion
would
put
to
the
test
those
*NL*
excellent
rudiments
which
he
had
learnt
from
Mr
Thwackum
and
Mr
*NL*
Square
;
and
it
would
be
entirely
owing
to
them
,
if
he
was
enabled
to
*NL*
survive
such
misfortunes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
debated
whether
Mr
Allworthy
should
be
informed
of
the
*NL*
death
of
his
sister
.
This
the
doctor
violently
opposed
;
in
which
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
the
whole
college
would
agree
with
him
:
but
Mr
Blifil
said
,
*NL*
he
had
received
such
positive
and
repeated
orders
from
his
uncle
,
*NL*
never
to
keep
any
secret
from
him
for
fear
of
the
disquietude
which
it
*NL*
might
give
him
,
that
he
durst
not
think
of
disobedience
,
whatever
*NL*
might
be
the
consequence
.
He
said
,
for
his
part
,
considering
the
*NL*
religious
and
philosophic
temper
of
his
uncle
,
he
could
not
agree
with
*NL*
the
doctor
in
his
apprehensions
.
He
was
therefore
resolved
to
*NL*
communicate
it
to
him
:
for
if
his
uncle
recovered
-LRB-
as
he
heartily
*NL*
prayed
he
might
-RRB-
he
knew
he
would
never
forgive
an
endeavour
to
keep
a
*NL*
secret
of
this
kind
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
physician
was
forced
to
submit
to
these
resolutions
,
which
the
two
*NL*
other
learned
gentlemen
very
highly
commended
.
So
together
moved
Mr
*NL*
Blifil
and
the
doctor
toward
the
sick-room
;
where
the
physician
first
*NL*
entered
,
and
approached
the
bed
,
in
order
to
feel
his
patient
's
pulse
,
*NL*
which
he
had
no
sooner
done
,
than
he
declared
he
was
much
better
;
that
*NL*
the
last
application
had
succeeded
to
a
miracle
,
and
had
brought
the
*NL*
fever
to
intermit
:
so
that
,
he
said
,
there
appeared
now
to
be
as
*NL*
little
danger
as
he
had
before
apprehended
there
were
hopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
Mr
Allworthy
's
situation
had
never
been
so
bad
as
*NL*
the
great
caution
of
the
doctor
had
represented
it
:
but
as
a
wise
*NL*
general
never
despises
his
enemy
,
however
inferior
that
enemy
's
force
*NL*
may
be
,
so
neither
doth
a
wise
physician
ever
despise
a
distemper
,
*NL*
however
inconsiderable
.
As
the
former
preserves
the
same
strict
*NL*
discipline
,
places
the
same
guards
,
and
employs
the
same
scouts
,
*NL*
though
the
enemy
be
never
so
weak
;
so
the
latter
maintains
the
same
*NL*
gravity
of
countenance
,
and
shakes
his
head
with
the
same
significant
*NL*
air
,
let
the
distemper
be
never
so
trifling
.
And
both
,
among
many
*NL*
other
good
ones
,
may
assign
this
solid
reason
for
their
conduct
,
that
*NL*
by
these
means
the
greater
glory
redounds
to
them
if
they
gain
the
*NL*
victory
,
and
the
less
disgrace
if
by
any
unlucky
accident
they
should
*NL*
happen
to
be
conquered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
had
no
sooner
lifted
up
his
eyes
,
and
thanked
Heaven
for
*NL*
these
hopes
of
his
recovery
,
than
Mr
Blifil
drew
near
,
with
a
very
*NL*
dejected
aspect
,
and
having
applied
his
handkerchief
to
his
eye
,
*NL*
either
to
wipe
away
his
tears
,
or
to
do
as
Ovid
somewhere
expresses
*NL*
himself
on
another
occasion
*NL*
*NL*
_
Si
nullus
erit
,
tamen
excute
nullum
,
_
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
be
none
,
then
wipe
away
that
none
,
*NL*
*NL*
he
communicated
to
his
uncle
what
the
reader
hath
been
just
before
*NL*
acquainted
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
received
the
news
with
concern
,
with
patience
,
and
with
*NL*
resignation
.
He
dropt
a
tender
tear
,
then
composed
his
countenance
,
*NL*
and
at
last
cried
,
``
The
Lord
's
will
be
done
in
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
enquired
for
the
messenger
;
but
Blifil
told
him
it
had
been
*NL*
impossible
to
detain
him
a
moment
;
for
he
appeared
by
the
great
hurry
*NL*
he
was
in
to
have
some
business
of
importance
on
his
hands
;
that
he
*NL*
complained
of
being
hurried
and
driven
and
torn
out
of
his
life
,
and
*NL*
repeated
many
times
,
that
if
he
could
divide
himself
into
four
*NL*
quarters
,
he
knew
how
to
dispose
of
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
then
desired
Blifil
to
take
care
of
the
funeral
.
He
said
,
he
*NL*
would
have
his
sister
deposited
in
his
own
chapel
;
and
as
to
the
*NL*
particulars
,
he
left
them
to
his
own
discretion
,
only
mentioning
the
*NL*
person
whom
he
would
have
employed
on
this
occasion
.

Which
,
among
other
things
,
may
serve
as
a
comment
on
that
saying
of
*NL*
Aeschines
,
that
``
drunkenness
shows
the
mind
of
a
man
,
as
a
mirrour
*NL*
reflects

The
reader
may
perhaps
wonder
at
hearing
nothing
of
Mr
Jones
in
the
*NL*
last
chapter
.
In
fact
,
his
behaviour
was
so
different
from
that
of
the
*NL*
persons
there
mentioned
,
that
we
chose
not
to
confound
his
name
with
*NL*
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
good
man
had
ended
his
speech
,
Jones
was
the
last
who
*NL*
deserted
the
room
.
Thence
he
retired
to
his
own
apartment
,
to
give
*NL*
vent
to
his
concern
;
but
the
restlessness
of
his
mind
would
not
suffer
*NL*
him
to
remain
long
there
;
he
slipped
softly
therefore
to
Allworthy
's
*NL*
chamber-door
,
where
he
listened
a
considerable
time
without
hearing
*NL*
any
kind
of
motion
within
,
unless
a
violent
snoring
,
which
at
last
his
*NL*
fears
misrepresented
as
groans
.
This
so
alarmed
him
,
that
he
could
not
*NL*
forbear
entering
the
room
;
where
he
found
the
good
man
in
the
bed
,
in
*NL*
a
sweet
composed
sleep
,
and
his
nurse
snoring
in
the
above
mentioned
*NL*
hearty
manner
,
at
the
bed
's
feet
.
He
immediately
took
the
only
method
*NL*
of
silencing
this
thorough
bass
,
whose
music
he
feared
might
disturb
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
then
sitting
down
by
the
nurse
,
he
remained
*NL*
motionless
till
Blifil
and
the
doctor
came
in
together
and
waked
the
*NL*
sick
man
,
in
order
that
the
doctor
might
feel
his
pulse
,
and
that
the
*NL*
other
might
communicate
to
him
that
piece
of
news
,
which
,
had
Jones
*NL*
been
apprized
of
it
,
would
have
had
great
difficulty
of
finding
its
*NL*
way
to
Mr
Allworthy
's
ear
at
such
a
season
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
first
heard
Blifil
tell
his
uncle
this
story
,
Jones
could
*NL*
hardly
contain
the
wrath
which
kindled
in
him
at
the
other
's
*NL*
indiscretion
,
especially
as
the
doctor
shook
his
head
,
and
declared
*NL*
his
unwillingness
to
have
the
matter
mentioned
to
his
patient
.
But
as
*NL*
his
passion
did
not
so
far
deprive
him
of
all
use
of
his
*NL*
understanding
,
as
to
hide
from
him
the
consequences
which
any
violent
*NL*
expression
towards
Blifil
might
have
on
the
sick
,
this
apprehension
*NL*
stilled
his
rage
at
the
present
;
and
he
grew
afterwards
so
satisfied
*NL*
with
finding
that
this
news
had
,
in
fact
,
produced
no
mischief
,
that
*NL*
he
suffered
his
anger
to
die
in
his
own
bosom
,
without
ever
mentioning
*NL*
it
to
Blifil
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
physician
dined
that
day
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
;
and
having
after
*NL*
dinner
visited
his
patient
,
he
returned
to
the
company
,
and
told
them
,
*NL*
that
he
had
now
the
satisfaction
to
say
,
with
assurance
,
that
his
*NL*
patient
was
out
of
all
danger
:
that
he
had
brought
his
fever
to
a
*NL*
perfect
intermission
,
and
doubted
not
by
throwing
in
the
bark
to
*NL*
prevent
its
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
account
so
pleased
Jones
,
and
threw
him
into
such
immoderate
*NL*
excess
of
rapture
,
that
he
might
be
truly
said
to
be
drunk
with
*NL*
joy
--
an
intoxication
which
greatly
forwards
the
effects
of
wine
;
and
*NL*
as
he
was
very
free
too
with
the
bottle
on
this
occasion
-LRB-
for
he
drank
*NL*
many
bumpers
to
the
doctor
's
health
,
as
well
as
to
other
toasts
-RRB-
he
*NL*
became
very
soon
literally
drunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
naturally
violent
animal
spirits
:
these
being
set
on
float
*NL*
and
augmented
by
the
spirit
of
wine
,
produced
most
extravagant
*NL*
effects
.
He
kissed
the
doctor
,
and
embraced
him
with
the
most
*NL*
passionate
endearments
;
swearing
that
next
to
Mr
Allworthy
himself
,
he
*NL*
loved
him
of
all
men
living
.
``
Doctor
,
''
added
he
,
``
you
deserve
a
statue
*NL*
to
be
erected
to
you
at
the
public
expense
,
for
having
preserved
a
*NL*
man
,
who
is
not
only
the
darling
of
all
good
men
who
know
him
,
but
a
*NL*
blessing
to
society
,
the
glory
of
his
country
,
and
an
honour
to
human
*NL*
nature
.
D
--
n
me
if
I
do
n't
love
him
better
than
my
own
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
shame
for
you
,
''
cries
Thwackum
.
``
Though
I
think
you
have
reason
*NL*
to
love
him
,
for
he
hath
provided
very
well
for
you
.
And
perhaps
it
*NL*
might
have
been
better
for
some
folks
that
he
had
not
lived
to
see
*NL*
just
reason
of
revoking
his
gift
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
now
looking
on
Thwackum
with
inconceivable
disdain
,
answered
,
*NL*
``
And
doth
thy
mean
soul
imagine
that
any
such
considerations
could
*NL*
weigh
with
me
?
No
,
let
the
earth
open
and
swallow
her
own
dirt
-LRB-
if
I
*NL*
had
millions
of
acres
I
would
say
it
-RRB-
rather
than
swallow
up
my
dear
*NL*
glorious
friend
.

``
What
modesty
or
measure
can
set
bounds
to
our
desire
of
so
dear
*NL*
a
friend
?
''
The
word
_
desiderium
_
here
can
not
be
easily
translated
.
*NL*
It
includes
our
desire
of
enjoying
our
friend
again
,
and
the
grief
*NL*
which
attends
that
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
now
interposed
,
and
prevented
the
effects
of
a
wrath
which
*NL*
was
kindling
between
Jones
and
Thwackum
;
after
which
the
former
gave
a
*NL*
loose
to
mirth
,
sang
two
or
three
amorous
songs
,
and
fell
into
every
*NL*
frantic
disorder
which
unbridled
joy
is
apt
to
inspire
;
but
so
far
was
*NL*
he
from
any
disposition
to
quarrel
,
that
he
was
ten
times
better
*NL*
humoured
,
if
possible
,
than
when
he
was
sober
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
truth
,
nothing
is
more
erroneous
than
the
common
observation
,
*NL*
that
men
who
are
ill-natured
and
quarrelsome
when
they
are
drunk
,
are
*NL*
very
worthy
persons
when
they
are
sober
:
for
drink
,
in
reality
,
doth
*NL*
not
reverse
nature
,
or
create
passions
in
men
which
did
not
exist
in
*NL*
them
before
.
It
takes
away
the
guard
of
reason
,
and
consequently
*NL*
forces
us
to
produce
those
symptoms
,
which
many
,
when
sober
,
have
art
*NL*
enough
to
conceal
.
It
heightens
and
inflames
our
passions
-LRB-
generally
*NL*
indeed
that
passion
which
is
uppermost
in
our
mind
-RRB-
,
so
that
the
angry
*NL*
temper
,
the
amorous
,
the
generous
,
the
good-humoured
,
the
avaricious
,
*NL*
and
all
other
dispositions
of
men
,
are
in
their
cups
heightened
and
*NL*
exposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
as
no
nation
produces
so
many
drunken
quarrels
,
especially
*NL*
among
the
lower
people
,
as
England
-LRB-
for
indeed
,
with
them
,
to
drink
*NL*
and
to
fight
together
are
almost
synonymous
terms
-RRB-
,
I
would
not
,
*NL*
methinks
,
have
it
thence
concluded
,
that
the
English
are
the
*NL*
worst-natured
people
alive
.
Perhaps
the
love
of
glory
only
is
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
this
;
so
that
the
fair
conclusion
seems
to
be
,
that
our
*NL*
countrymen
have
more
of
that
love
,
and
more
of
bravery
,
than
any
other
*NL*
plebeians
.
And
this
the
rather
,
as
there
is
seldom
anything
*NL*
ungenerous
,
unfair
,
or
ill-natured
,
exercised
on
these
occasions
:
nay
,
*NL*
it
is
common
for
the
combatants
to
express
good-will
for
each
other
*NL*
even
at
the
time
of
the
conflict
;
and
as
their
drunken
mirth
generally
*NL*
ends
in
a
battle
,
so
do
most
of
their
battles
end
in
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
our
history
.
Though
Jones
had
shown
no
design
of
*NL*
giving
offence
,
yet
Mr
Blifil
was
highly
offended
at
a
behaviour
which
*NL*
was
so
inconsistent
with
the
sober
and
prudent
reserve
of
his
own
*NL*
temper
.
He
bore
it
too
with
the
greater
impatience
,
as
it
appeared
to
*NL*
him
very
indecent
at
this
season
;
``
When
,
''
as
he
said
,
``
the
house
was
a
*NL*
house
of
mourning
,
on
the
account
of
his
dear
mother
;
and
if
it
had
*NL*
pleased
Heaven
to
give
him
some
prospect
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
recovery
,
*NL*
it
would
become
them
better
to
express
the
exultations
of
their
hearts
*NL*
in
thanksgiving
,
than
in
drunkenness
and
riots
;
which
were
properer
*NL*
methods
to
encrease
the
Divine
wrath
,
than
to
avert
it
.
''
Thwackum
,
who
*NL*
had
swallowed
more
liquor
than
Jones
,
but
without
any
ill
effect
on
*NL*
his
brain
,
seconded
the
pious
harangue
of
Blifil
;
but
Square
,
for
*NL*
reasons
which
the
reader
may
probably
guess
,
was
totally
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wine
had
not
so
totally
overpowered
Jones
,
as
to
prevent
his
*NL*
recollecting
Mr
Blifil
's
loss
,
the
moment
it
was
mentioned
.
As
no
*NL*
person
,
therefore
,
was
more
ready
to
confess
and
condemn
his
own
*NL*
errors
,
he
offered
to
shake
Mr
Blifil
by
the
hand
,
and
begged
his
*NL*
pardon
,
saying
,
``
His
excessive
joy
for
Mr
Allworthy
's
recovery
had
*NL*
driven
every
other
thought
out
of
his
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
scornfully
rejected
his
hand
;
and
with
much
indignation
*NL*
answered
,
``
It
was
little
to
be
wondered
at
,
if
tragical
spectacles
*NL*
made
no
impression
on
the
blind
;
but
,
for
his
part
,
he
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
know
who
his
parents
were
,
and
consequently
must
be
*NL*
affected
with
their
loss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
who
,
notwithstanding
his
good
humour
,
had
some
mixture
of
the
*NL*
irascible
in
his
constitution
,
leaped
hastily
from
his
chair
,
and
*NL*
catching
hold
of
Blifil
's
collar
,
cried
out
,
``
D
--
n
you
for
a
rascal
,
*NL*
do
you
insult
me
with
the
misfortune
of
my
birth
?
''
He
accompanied
*NL*
these
words
with
such
rough
actions
,
that
they
soon
got
the
better
of
*NL*
Mr
Blifil
's
peaceful
temper
;
and
a
scuffle
immediately
ensued
,
which
*NL*
might
have
produced
mischief
,
had
it
not
been
prevented
by
the
*NL*
interposition
of
Thwackum
and
the
physician
;
for
the
philosophy
of
*NL*
Square
rendered
him
superior
to
all
emotions
,
and
he
very
calmly
*NL*
smoaked
his
pipe
,
as
was
his
custom
in
all
broils
,
unless
when
he
*NL*
apprehended
some
danger
of
having
it
broke
in
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
combatants
being
now
prevented
from
executing
present
vengeance
on
*NL*
each
other
,
betook
themselves
to
the
common
resources
of
disappointed
*NL*
rage
,
and
vented
their
wrath
in
threats
and
defiance
.
In
this
kind
of
*NL*
conflict
,
Fortune
,
which
,
in
the
personal
attack
,
seemed
to
incline
to
*NL*
Jones
,
was
now
altogether
as
favourable
to
his
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
truce
,
nevertheless
,
was
at
length
agreed
on
,
by
the
mediation
of
*NL*
the
neutral
parties
,
and
the
whole
company
again
sat
down
at
the
*NL*
table
;
where
Jones
being
prevailed
on
to
ask
pardon
,
and
Blifil
to
*NL*
give
it
,
peace
was
restored
,
and
everything
seemed
_
in
statu
quo
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
the
quarrel
was
,
in
all
appearance
,
perfectly
reconciled
,
*NL*
the
good
humour
which
had
been
interrupted
by
it
,
was
by
no
means
*NL*
restored
.
All
merriment
was
now
at
an
end
,
and
the
subsequent
*NL*
discourse
consisted
only
of
grave
relations
of
matters
of
fact
,
and
of
*NL*
as
grave
observations
upon
them
;
a
species
of
conversation
,
in
which
,
*NL*
though
there
is
much
of
dignity
and
instruction
,
there
is
but
little
*NL*
entertainment
.
As
we
presume
therefore
to
convey
only
this
last
to
the
*NL*
reader
,
we
shall
pass
by
whatever
was
said
,
till
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
company
having
by
degrees
dropped
off
,
left
only
Square
and
the
*NL*
physician
together
;
at
which
time
the
conversation
was
a
little
*NL*
heightened
by
some
comments
on
what
had
happened
between
the
two
young
*NL*
gentlemen
;
both
of
whom
the
doctor
declared
to
be
no
better
than
*NL*
scoundrels
;
to
which
appellation
the
philosopher
,
very
sagaciously
*NL*
shaking
his
head
,
agreed

Showing
the

of
many
observations
of
Ovid

and
of

more

grave

have
proved
beyond
contradiction
,
that
wine
is
*NL*
often
the
forerunner
of
incontinency
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
retired
from
the
company
,
in
which
we
have
seen
him
engaged
,
*NL*
into
the
fields
,
where
he
intended
to
cool
himself
by
a
walk
in
the
*NL*
open
air
before
he
attended
Mr
Allworthy
.
There
,
whilst
he
renewed
*NL*
those
meditations
on
his
dear
Sophia
,
which
the
dangerous
illness
of
*NL*
his
friend
and
benefactor
had
for
some
time
interrupted
,
an
accident
*NL*
happened
,
which
with
sorrow
we
relate
,
and
with
sorrow
doubtless
will
*NL*
it
be
read
;
however
,
that
historic
truth
to
which
we
profess
so
*NL*
inviolable
an
attachment
,
obliges
us
to
communicate
it
to
posterity
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
a
pleasant
evening
in
the
latter
end
of
June
,
when
our
*NL*
heroe
was
walking
in
a
most
delicious
grove
,
where
the
gentle
breezes
*NL*
fanning
the
leaves
,
together
with
the
sweet
trilling
of
a
murmuring
*NL*
stream
,
and
the
melodious
notes
of
nightingales
,
formed
altogether
the
*NL*
most
enchanting
harmony
.
In
this
scene
,
so
sweetly
accommodated
to
*NL*
love
,
he
meditated
on
his
dear
Sophia
.
While
his
wanton
fancy
roamed
*NL*
unbounded
over
all
her
beauties
,
and
his
lively
imagination
painted
*NL*
the
charming
maid
in
various
ravishing
forms
,
his
warm
heart
melted
*NL*
with
tenderness
;
and
at
length
,
throwing
himself
on
the
ground
,
by
the
*NL*
side
of
a
gently
murmuring
brook
,
he
broke
forth
into
the
following
*NL*
ejaculation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Sophia
,
would
Heaven
give
thee
to
my
arms
,
how
blest
would
be
my
*NL*
condition
!
Curst
be
that
fortune
which
sets
a
distance
between
us

possessed
of
thee

there
a
man
on
earth
whom
I
would
envy
!
How
contemptible
would
the
*NL*
brightest
Circassian
beauty
,
drest
in
all
the
jewels
of
the
Indies
,
*NL*
appear
to
my
eyes
!
But
why
do
I
mention
another
woman
?
Could
I
think
*NL*
my
eyes
capable
of
looking
at
any
other
with
tenderness
,
these
hands
*NL*
should
tear
them
from
my
head
.
No
,
my
Sophia
,
if
cruel
fortune
*NL*
separates
us
for
ever
,
my
soul
shall
doat
on
thee
alone
.
The
chastest
*NL*
constancy
will
I
ever
preserve
to
thy
image
.
Though
I
should
never
*NL*
have
possession
of
thy
charming
person
,
still
shalt
thou
alone
have
*NL*
possession
of
my
thoughts
,
my
love
,
my
soul
.
Oh
!
my
fond
heart
is
so
*NL*
wrapt
in
that
tender
bosom
,
that
the
brightest
beauties
would
for
me
*NL*
have
no
charms
,
nor
would
a
hermit
be
colder
in
their
embraces
.
*NL*
Sophia
,
Sophia
alone
shall
be
mine
.
What
raptures
are
in
that
name
!
I
*NL*
will
engrave
it
on
every
tree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
he
started
up
,
and
beheld
--
not
his
Sophia
--
no
,
nor
a
*NL*
Circassian
maid
richly
and
elegantly
attired
for
the
grand
Signior
's
*NL*
seraglio
.
No
;
without
a
gown
,
in
a
shift
that
was
somewhat
of
the
*NL*
coarsest
,
and
none
of
the
cleanest
,
bedewed
likewise
with
some
*NL*
odoriferous
effluvia
,
the
produce
of
the
day
's
labour
,
with
a
*NL*
pitchfork
in
her
hand
,
Molly
Seagrim
approached
.
Our
hero
had
his
*NL*
penknife
in
his
hand
,
which
he
had
drawn
for
the
before-mentioned
*NL*
purpose
of
carving
on
the
bark
;
when
the
girl
coming
near
him
,
cryed
*NL*
out
with
a
smile
,
``
You
do
n't
intend
to
kill
me
,
squire
,
I
hope
!
''
--
``
Why
*NL*
should
you
think
I
would
kill
you
?
''
answered
Jones
.
``
Nay
,
''
replied
*NL*
she
,
``
after
your
cruel
usage
of
me
when
I
saw
you
last
,
killing
me
*NL*
would
,
perhaps
,
be
too
great
kindness
for
me
to
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
ensued
a
parley
,
which
,
as
I
do
not
think
myself
obliged
to
*NL*
relate
it
,
I
shall
omit
.
It
is
sufficient
that
it
lasted
a
full
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
the
conclusion
of
which
they
retired
into
the
*NL*
thickest
part
of
the
grove
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
my
readers
may
be
inclined
to
think
this
event
unnatural
.
*NL*
However
,
the
fact
is
true
;
and
perhaps
may
be
sufficiently
accounted
*NL*
for
by
suggesting
,
that
Jones
probably
thought
one
woman
better
than
*NL*
none
,
and
Molly
as
probably
imagined
two
men
to
be
better
than
one
.
*NL*
Besides
the
before-mentioned
motive
assigned
to
the
present
behaviour
*NL*
of
Jones
,
the
reader
will
be
likewise
pleased
to
recollect
in
his
*NL*
favour
,
that
he
was
not
at
this
time
perfect
master
of
that
wonderful
*NL*
power
of
reason
,
which
so
well
enables
grave
and
wise
men
to
subdue
*NL*
their
unruly
passions
,
and
to
decline
any
of
these
prohibited
*NL*
amusements
.
Wine
now
had
totally
subdued
this
power
in
Jones
.
He
was
,
*NL*
indeed
,
in
a
condition
,
in
which
,
if
reason
had
interposed
,
though
*NL*
only
to
advise
,
she
might
have
received
the
answer
which
one
*NL*
Cleostratus
gave
many
years
ago
to
a
silly
fellow
,
who
asked
him
,
if
*NL*
he
was
not
ashamed
to
be
drunk
?
``
Are
not
you
,
''
said
Cleostratus
,
*NL*
``
ashamed
to
admonish
a
drunken
man
?
''
--
To
say
the
truth
,
in
a
court
of
*NL*
justice
drunkenness
must
not
be
an
excuse
,
yet
in
a
court
of
*NL*
conscience
it
is
greatly
so
;
and
therefore
Aristotle
,
who
commends
the
*NL*
laws
of
Pittacus
,
by
which
drunken
men
received
double
punishment
for
*NL*
their
crimes
,
allows
there
is
more
of
policy
than
justice
in
that
law
.
*NL*
Now
,
if
there
are
any
transgressions
pardonable
from
drunkenness
,
they
*NL*
are
certainly
such
as
Mr
Jones
was
at
present
guilty
of
;
on
which
head
*NL*
I
could
pour
forth
a
vast
profusion
of
learning
,
if
I
imagined
it
*NL*
would
either
entertain
my
reader
,
or
teach
him
anything
more
than
he
*NL*
knows
already
.
For
his
sake
therefore
I
shall
keep
my
learning
to
*NL*
myself
,
and
return
to
my
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
hath
been
observed
,
that
Fortune
seldom
doth
things
by
halves
.
To
*NL*
say
truth
,
there
is
no
end
to
her
freaks
whenever
she
is
disposed
to
*NL*
gratify
or
displease
.
No
sooner
had
our
heroe
retired
with
his
Dido
,
*NL*
but
*NL*
*NL*
_

_
*NL*
*NL*
the
parson
and
the
young
squire
,
who
were
taking
a
serious
walk
,
*NL*
arrived
at
the
stile
which
leads
into
the
grove
,
and
the
latter
caught
*NL*
a
view
of
the
lovers
just
as
they
were
sinking
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
knew
Jones
very
well
,
though
he
was
at
above
a
hundred
yards
'
*NL*
distance
,
and
he
was
as
positive
to
the
sex
of
his
companion
,
though
*NL*
not
to
the
individual
person
.
He
started
,
blessed
himself
,
and
uttered
*NL*
a
very
solemn
ejaculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
expressed
some
surprize
at
these
sudden
emotions
,
and
asked
*NL*
the
reason
of
them
.
To
which
Blifil
answered
,
``
He
was
certain
he
had
*NL*
seen
a
fellow
and
wench
retire
together
among
the
bushes
,
which
he
*NL*
doubted
not
was
with
some
wicked
purpose
.
''
As
to
the
name
of
Jones
,
he
*NL*
thought
proper
to
conceal
it
,
and
why
he
did
so
must
be
left
to
the
*NL*
judgment
of
the
sagacious
reader
;
for
we
never
chuse
to
assign
motives
*NL*
to
the
actions
of
men
,
when
there
is
any
possibility
of
our
being
*NL*
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parson
,
who
was
not
only
strictly
chaste
in
his
own
person
,
but
a
*NL*
great
enemy
to
the
opposite
vice
in
all
others
,
fired
at
this
*NL*
information
.
He
desired
Mr
Blifil
to
conduct
him
immediately
to
the
*NL*
place
,
which
as
he
approached
he
breathed
forth
vengeance
mixed
with
*NL*
lamentations
;
nor
did
he
refrain
from
casting
some
oblique
reflections
*NL*
on
Mr
Allworthy
;
insinuating
that
the
wickedness
of
the
country
was
*NL*
principally
owing
to
the
encouragement
he
had
given
to
vice
,
by
having
*NL*
exerted
such
kindness
to
a
bastard
,
and
by
having
mitigated
that
just
*NL*
and
wholesome
rigour
of
the
law
which
allots
a
very
severe
punishment
*NL*
to
loose
wenches
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
way
through
which
our
hunters
were
to
pass
in
pursuit
of
their
*NL*
game
was
so
beset
with
briars
,
that
it
greatly
obstructed
their
walk
,
*NL*
and
caused
besides
such
a
rustling
,
that
Jones
had
sufficient
warning
*NL*
of
their
arrival
before
they
could
surprize
him
;
nay
,
indeed
,
so
*NL*
incapable
was
Thwackum
of
concealing
his
indignation
,
and
such
*NL*
vengeance
did
he
mutter
forth
every
step
he
took
,
that
this
alone
must
*NL*
have
abundantly
satisfied
Jones
that
he
was

use
the
language
of

*NL*
*NL*
If

I

,
while
these
sacred
rites
,
which
are
in
common
to

_
are
in
agitation
between
the
stag
and
his

,
*NL*
any
hostile
beasts
should
venture
too
near
,
on
the
first
hint
given
by
*NL*
the
frighted
hind
,
fierce
and
tremendous
rushes
forth
the
stag
to
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
thicket
;
there
stands
he
centinel
over
his
love
,
*NL*
stamps
the
ground
with
his
foot
,
and
with
his
horns
brandished
aloft
*NL*
in
air
,
proudly
provokes
the
apprehended
foe
to
combat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
and
more
terrible
,
when
he
perceived
the
enemy
's
approach
,
*NL*
leaped
forth
our
heroe
.
Many
a
step
advanced
he
forwards
,
in
order
to
*NL*
conceal
the
trembling
hind
,
and
,
if
possible
,
to
secure
her
retreat
.
*NL*
And
now
Thwackum
,
having
first
darted
some
livid
lightning
from
his
*NL*
fiery
eyes
,
began
to
thunder
forth
,
``
Fie
upon
it
!
Fie
upon
it
!
Mr
*NL*
Jones
.
Is
it
possible
you
should
be
the
person
?
''
--
``
You
see
,
''
answered
*NL*
Jones
,
``
it
is
possible
I
should
be
here
.
''
--
``
And
who
,
''
said
Thwackum
,
*NL*
``
is
that
wicked
slut
with
you
?
''
--
``
If
I
have
any
wicked
slut
with
me
,
''
*NL*
cries
Jones
,
``
it
is
possible
I
shall
not
let
you
know
who
she
is
.
''
--
``
I
*NL*
command
you
to
tell
me
immediately
,
''
says
Thwackum
:
``
and
I
would
not
*NL*
have
you
imagine
,
young
man
,
that
your
age
,
though
it
hath
somewhat
*NL*
abridged
the
purpose
of
tuition
,
hath
totally
taken
away
the
authority
*NL*
of
the
master
.
The
relation
of
the
master
and
scholar
is
indelible
;
*NL*
as
,
indeed
,
all
other
relations
are
;
for
they
all
derive
their
*NL*
original
from
heaven
.
I
would
have
you
think
yourself
,
therefore
,
as
*NL*
much
obliged
to
obey
me
now
,
as
when
I
taught
you
your
first
*NL*
rudiments
.
''
--
``
I
believe
you
would
,
''
cries
Jones
;
``
but
that
will
not
*NL*
happen
,
unless
you
had
the
same
birchen
argument
to
convince
*NL*
me
.
''
--
``
Then
I
must
tell
you
plainly
,
''
said
Thwackum
,
``
I
am
resolved
to
*NL*
discover
the
wicked
wretch
.
''
--
``
And
I
must
tell
you
plainly
,
''
returned
*NL*
Jones
,
``
I
am
resolved
you
shall
not
.
''
Thwackum
then
offered
to
*NL*
advance
,
and
Jones
laid
hold
of
his
arms
;
which
Mr
Blifil
endeavoured
*NL*
to
rescue
,
declaring
,
``
he
would
not
see
his
old
master
insulted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
now
finding
himself
engaged
with
two
,
thought
it
necessary
to
*NL*
rid
himself
of
one
of
his
antagonists
as
soon
as
possible
.
He
*NL*
therefore
applied
to
the
weakest
first
;
and
,
letting
the
parson
go
,
he
*NL*
directed
a
blow
at
the
young
squire
's
breast
,
which
luckily
taking
*NL*
place
,
reduced
him
to
measure
his
length
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
was
so
intent
on
the
discovery
,
that
,
the
moment
he
found
*NL*
himself
at
liberty
,
he
stept
forward
directly
into
the
fern
,
without
*NL*
any
great
consideration
of
what
might
in
the
meantime
befal
his
*NL*
friend
;
but
he
had
advanced
a
very
few
paces
into
the
thicket
,
before
*NL*
Jones
,
having
defeated
Blifil
,
overtook
the
parson
,
and
dragged
him
*NL*
backward
by
the
skirt
of
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
parson
had
been
a
champion
in
his
youth
,
and
had
won
much
honour
*NL*
by
his
fist
,
both
at
school
and
at
the
university
.
He
had
now
indeed
,
*NL*
for
a
great
number
of
years
,
declined
the
practice
of
that
noble
art
;
*NL*
yet
was
his
courage
full
as
strong
as
his
faith
,
and
his
body
no
less
*NL*
strong
than
either
.
He
was
moreover
,
as
the
reader
may
perhaps
have
*NL*
conceived
,
somewhat
irascible
in
his
nature
.
When
he
looked
back
,
*NL*
therefore
,
and
saw
his
friend
stretched
out
on
the
ground
,
and
found
*NL*
himself
at
the
same
time
so
roughly
handled
by
one
who
had
formerly
*NL*
been
only
passive
in
all
conflicts
between
them
-LRB-
a
circumstance
which
*NL*
highly
aggravated
the
whole
-RRB-
,
his
patience
at
length
gave
way
;
he
*NL*
threw
himself
into
a
posture
of
offence
;
and
collecting
all
his
force
,
*NL*
attacked
Jones
in
the
front
with
as
much
impetuosity
as
he
had
*NL*
formerly
attacked
him
in
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
heroe
received
the
enemy
's
attack
with
the
most
undaunted
*NL*
intrepidity
,
and
his
bosom
resounded
with
the
blow
.
This
he
presently
*NL*
returned
with
no
less
violence
,
aiming
likewise
at
the
parson
's
*NL*
breast
;
but
he
dexterously
drove
down
the
fist
of
Jones
,
so
that
it
*NL*
reached
only
his
belly
,
where
two
pounds
of
beef
and
as
many
of
*NL*
pudding
were
then
deposited
,
and
whence
consequently
no
hollow
sound
*NL*
could
proceed
.
Many
lusty
blows
,
much
more
pleasant
as
well
as
easy
to
*NL*
have
seen
,
than
to
read
or
describe
,
were
given
on
both
sides
:
at
last
*NL*
a
violent
fall
,
in
which
Jones
had
thrown
his
knees
into
Thwackum
's
*NL*
breast
,
so
weakened
the
latter
,
that
victory
had
been
no
longer
*NL*
dubious
,
had
not
Blifil
,
who
had
now
recovered
his
strength
,
again
*NL*
renewed
the
fight
,
and
by
engaging
with
Jones
,
given
the
parson
a
*NL*
moment
's
time
to
shake
his
ears
,
and
to
regain
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
both
together
attacked
our
heroe
,
whose
blows
did
not
retain
*NL*
that
force
with
which
they
had
fallen
at
first
,
so
weakened
was
he
by
*NL*
his
combat
with
Thwackum
;
for
though
the
pedagogue
chose
rather
to
*NL*
play
_
solos
_
on
the
human
instrument
,
and
had
been
lately
used
to
*NL*
those
only
,
yet
he
still
retained
enough
of
his
antient
knowledge
to
*NL*
perform
his
part
very
well
in
a
_
duet
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
victory
,
according
to
modern
custom
,
was
like
to
be
decided
by
*NL*
numbers
,
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
a
fourth
pair
of
fists
appeared
in
the
*NL*
battle
,
and
immediately
paid
their
compliments
to
the
parson
;
and
the
*NL*
owner
of
them
at
the
same
time
crying
out
,
``
Are
not
you
ashamed
,
and
*NL*
be
d
--
n
'd
to
you
,
to
fall
two
of
you
upon
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
battle
,
which
was
of
the
kind
that
for
distinction
's
sake
is
*NL*
called
royal
,
now
raged
with
the
utmost
violence
during
a
few
minutes
;
*NL*
till
Blifil
being
a
second
time
laid
sprawling
by
Jones
,
Thwackum
*NL*
condescended
to
apply
for
quarter
to
his
new
antagonist
,
who
was
now
*NL*
found
to
be
Mr
Western
himself
;
for
in
the
heat
of
the
action
none
of
*NL*
the
combatants
had
recognized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
that
honest
squire
,
happening
,
in
his
afternoon
's
walk
with
*NL*
some
company
,
to
pass
through
the
field
where
the
bloody
battle
was
*NL*
fought
,
and
having
concluded
,
from
seeing
three
men
engaged
,
that
two
*NL*
of
them
must
be
on
a
side
,
he
hastened
from
his
companions
,
and
with
*NL*
more
gallantry
than
policy
,
espoused
the
cause
of
the
weaker
party
.
By
*NL*
which
generous
proceeding
he
very
probably
prevented
Mr
Jones
from
*NL*
becoming
a
victim
to
the
wrath
of
Thwackum
,
and
to
the
pious
*NL*
friendship
which
Blifil
bore
his
old
master
;
for
,
besides
the
*NL*
disadvantage
of
such
odds
,
Jones
had
not
yet
sufficiently
recovered
*NL*
the
former
strength
of
his
broken
arm
.
This
reinforcement
,
however
,
*NL*
soon
put
an
end
to
the
action
,
and
Jones
with
his
ally
obtained
the
*NL*
victory
.

Chapter
xii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
is
seen
a
more
moving
spectacle
than
all
the
blood
in
the
*NL*
bodies
of
Thwackum
and
Blifil
,
and
of
twenty
other
such
,
is
capable
of
*NL*
producing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
Mr
Western
's
company
were
now
come
up
,
being
just
at
the
*NL*
instant
when
the
action
was
over
.
These
were
the
honest
clergyman
,
*NL*
whom
we
have
formerly
seen
at
Mr
Western
's
table
;
Mrs
Western
,
the
*NL*
aunt
of
Sophia
;
and
lastly
,
the
lovely
Sophia
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
,
the
following
was
the
aspect
of
the
bloody
field
.
In
one
*NL*
place
lay
on
the
ground
,
all
pale
,
and
almost
breathless
,
the
*NL*
vanquished
Blifil
.
Near
him
stood
the
conqueror
Jones
,
almost
covered
*NL*
with
blood
,
part
of
which
was
naturally
his
own
,
and
part
had
been
*NL*
lately
the
property
of
the
Reverend
Mr
Thwackum
.
In
a
third
place
*NL*
stood
the
said
Thwackum
,
like
King
Porus
,
sullenly
submitting
to
the
*NL*
conqueror
.
The
last
figure
in
the
piece
was
Western
the
Great
,
most
*NL*
gloriously
forbearing
the
vanquished
foe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
,
in
whom
there
was
little
sign
of
life
,
was
at
first
the
*NL*
principal
object
of
the
concern
of
every
one
,
and
particularly
of
Mrs
*NL*
Western
,
who
had
drawn
from
her
pocket
a
bottle
of
hartshorn
,
and
was
*NL*
herself
about
to
apply
it
to
his
nostrils
,
when
on
a
sudden
the
*NL*
attention
of
the
whole
company
was
diverted
from
poor
Blifil
,
whose
*NL*
spirit
,
if
it
had
any
such
design
,
might
have
now
taken
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
stealing
off
to
the
other
world
,
without
any
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
now
a
more
melancholy
and
a
more
lovely
object
lay
motionless
*NL*
before
them
.
This
was
no
other
than
the
charming
Sophia
herself
,
who
,
*NL*
from
the
sight
of
blood
,
or
from
fear
for
her
father
,
or
from
some
*NL*
other
reason
,
had
fallen
down
in
a
swoon
,
before
any
one
could
get
to
*NL*
her
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
first
saw
her
and
screamed
.
Immediately
two
or
three
*NL*
voices
cried
out
,
``
Miss
Western
is
dead
.
''
Hartshorn
,
water
,
every
*NL*
remedy
was
called
for
,
almost
at
one
and
the
same
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
remember
,
that
in
our
description
of
this
grove
we
*NL*
mentioned
a
murmuring
brook
,
which
brook
did
not
come
there
,
as
such
*NL*
gentle
streams
flow
through
vulgar
romances
,
with
no
other
purpose
*NL*
than
to
murmur
.
No
!
Fortune
had
decreed
to
ennoble
this
little
brook
*NL*
with
a
higher
honour
than
any
of
those
which
wash
the
plains
of
*NL*
Arcadia
ever
deserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
rubbing
Blifil
's
temples
,
for
he
began
to
fear
he
had
given
*NL*
him
a
blow
too
much
,
when
the
words
,
Miss
Western
and
Dead
,
rushed
at
*NL*
once
on
his
ear
.
He
started
up
,
left
Blifil
to
his
fate
,
and
flew
to
*NL*
Sophia
,
whom
,
while
all
the
rest
were
running
against
each
other
,
*NL*
backward
and
forward
,
looking
for
water
in
the
dry
paths
,
he
caught
up
*NL*
in
his
arms
,
and
then
ran
away
with
her
over
the
field
to
the
rivulet
*NL*
above
mentioned
;
where
,
plunging
himself
into
the
water
,
he
contrived
*NL*
to
besprinkle
her
face
,
head
,
and
neck
very
plentifully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happy
was
it
for
Sophia
that
the
same
confusion
which
prevented
her
*NL*
other
friends
from
serving
her
,
prevented
them
likewise
from
*NL*
obstructing
Jones
.
He
had
carried
her
half
ways
before
they
knew
what
*NL*
he
was
doing
,
and
he
had
actually
restored
her
to
life
before
they
*NL*
reached
the
waterside
.
She
stretched
out
her
arms
,
opened
her
eyes
,
*NL*
and
cried
,
``
Oh
!
heavens
!
''
just
as
her
father
,
aunt
,
and
the
parson
*NL*
came
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
who
had
hitherto
held
this
lovely
burthen
in
his
arms
,
now
*NL*
relinquished
his
hold
;
but
gave
her
at
the
same
instant
a
tender
*NL*
caress
,
which
,
had
her
senses
been
then
perfectly
restored
,
could
not
*NL*
have
escaped
her
observation
.
As
she
expressed
,
therefore
,
no
*NL*
displeasure
at
this
freedom
,
we
suppose
she
was
not
sufficiently
*NL*
recovered
from
her
swoon
at
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
tragical
scene
was
now
converted
into
a
sudden
scene
of
joy
.
In
*NL*
this
our
heroe
was
certainly
the
principal
character
;
for
as
he
*NL*
probably
felt
more
ecstatic
delight
in
having
saved
Sophia
than
she
*NL*
herself
received
from
being
saved
,
so
neither
were
the
congratulations
*NL*
paid
to
her
equal
to
what
were
conferred
on
Jones
,
especially
by
Mr
*NL*
Western
himself
,
who
,
after
having
once
or
twice
embraced
his
*NL*
daughter
,
fell
to
hugging
and
kissing
Jones
.
He
called
him
the
*NL*
preserver
of
Sophia
,
and
declared
there
was
nothing
,
except
her
,
or
*NL*
his
estate
,
which
he
would
not
give
him
;
but
upon
recollection
,
he
*NL*
afterwards
excepted
his
fox-hounds
,
the
Chevalier
,
and
Miss
Slouch
*NL*
-LRB-
for
so
he
called
his
favourite
mare
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
fears
for
Sophia
being
now
removed
,
Jones
became
the
object
of
the
*NL*
squire
's
consideration
.
--
``
Come
,
my
lad
,
''
says
Western
,
``
d'off
thy
*NL*
quoat
and
wash
thy
feace
;
for
att
in
a
devilish
pickle
,
I
promise
*NL*
thee
.
Come
,
come
,
wash
thyself
,
and
shat
go
huome
with
me
;
and
we
'
l
*NL*
zee
to
vind
thee
another
quoat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
immediately
complied
,
threw
off
his
coat
,
went
down
to
the
*NL*
water
,
and
washed
both
his
face
and
bosom
;
for
the
latter
was
as
much
*NL*
exposed
and
as
bloody
as
the
former
.
But
though
the
water
could
clear
*NL*
off
the
blood
,
it
could
not
remove
the
black
and
blue
marks
which
*NL*
Thwackum
had
imprinted
on
both
his
face
and
breast
,
and
which
,
being
*NL*
discerned
by
Sophia
,
drew
from
her
a
sigh
and
a
look
full
of
*NL*
inexpressible
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
received
this
full
in
his
eyes
,
and
it
had
infinitely
a
stronger
*NL*
effect
on
him
than
all
the
contusions
which
he
had
received
before
.
An
*NL*
effect
,
however
,
widely
different
;
for
so
soft
and
balmy
was
it
,
that
,
*NL*
had
all
his
former
blows
been
stabs
,
it
would
for
some
minutes
have
*NL*
prevented
his
feeling
their
smart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
now
moved
backwards
,
and
soon
arrived
where
Thwackum
had
*NL*
got
Mr
Blifil
again
on
his
legs
.
Here
we
can
not
suppress
a
pious
wish
,
*NL*
that
all
quarrels
were
to
be
decided
by
those
weapons
only
with
which
*NL*
Nature
,
knowing
what
is
proper
for
us
,
hath
supplied
us
;
and
that
cold
*NL*
iron
was
to
be
used
in
digging
no
bowels
but
those
of
the
earth
.
Then
*NL*
would
war
,
the
pastime
of
monarchs
,
be
almost
inoffensive
,
and
battles
*NL*
between
great
armies
might
be
fought
at
the
particular
desire
of
*NL*
several
ladies
of
quality
;
who
,
together
with
the
kings
themselves
,
*NL*
might
be
actual
spectators
of
the
conflict
.
Then
might
the
field
be
*NL*
this
moment
well
strewed
with
human
carcasses
,
and
the
next
,
the
dead
*NL*
men
,
or
infinitely
the
greatest
part
of
them
,
might
get
up
,
like
Mr
*NL*
Bayes
's
troops
,
and
march
off
either
at
the
sound
of
a
drum
or
fiddle
,
*NL*
as
should
be
previously
agreed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
avoid
,
if
possible
,
treating
this
matter
ludicrously
,
lest
*NL*
grave
men
and
politicians
,
whom
I
know
to
be
offended
at
a
jest
,
may
*NL*
cry
pish
at
it
;
but
,
in
reality
,
might
not
a
battle
be
as
well
decided
*NL*
by
the
greater
number
of
broken
heads
,
bloody
noses
,
and
black
eyes
,
*NL*
as
by
the
greater
heaps
of
mangled
and
murdered
human
bodies
?
Might
*NL*
not
towns
be
contended
for
in
the
same
manner
?
Indeed
,
this
may
be
*NL*
thought
too
detrimental
a
scheme
to
the
French
interest
,
since
they
*NL*
would
thus
lose
the
advantage
they
have
over
other
nations
in
the
*NL*
superiority
of
their
engineers
;
but
when
I
consider
the
gallantry
and
*NL*
generosity
of
that
people
,
I
am
persuaded
they
would
never
decline
*NL*
putting
themselves
upon
a
par
with
their
adversary
;
or
,
as
the
phrase
*NL*
is
,
making
themselves
his
match
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
such
reformations
are
rather
to
be
wished
than
hoped
for
:
I
shall
*NL*
content
myself
,
therefore
,
with
this
short
hint
,
and
return
to
my
*NL*
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
Western
began
now
to
inquire
into
the
original
rise
of
this
quarrel
.
*NL*
To
which
neither
Blifil
nor
Jones
gave
any
answer
;
but
Thwackum
said
*NL*
surlily
,
``
I
believe
the
cause
is
not
far
off
;
if
you
beat
the
bushes
*NL*
well
you
may
find
her
.
''
--
``
Find
her
?
''
replied
Western
:
``
what
!
have
you
*NL*
been
fighting
for
a
wench
?
''
--
``
Ask
the
gentleman
in
his
waistcoat
*NL*
there
,
''
said
Thwackum
:
``
he
best
knows
.
''
``
Nay
then
,
''
cries
Western
,
``
it
*NL*
is
a
wench
certainly
.
--
Ah
,
Tom
,
Tom
,
thou
art
a
liquorish
dog
.
But
*NL*
come
,
gentlemen
,
be
all
friends
,
and
go
home
with
me
,
and
make
final
*NL*
peace
over
a
bottle
.
''
``
I
ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
''
says
Thwackum
:
``
it
is
*NL*
no
such
slight
matter
for
a
man
of
my
character
to
be
thus
injuriously
*NL*
treated
,
and
buffeted
by
a
boy
,
only
because
I
would
have
done
my
*NL*
duty
,
in
endeavouring
to
detect
and
bring
to
justice
a
wanton
harlot
;
*NL*
but
,
indeed
,
the
principal
fault
lies
in
Mr
Allworthy
and
yourself
;
*NL*
for
if
you
put
the
laws
in
execution
,
as
you
ought
to
do
,
you
will
*NL*
soon
rid
the
country
of
these
vermin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
as
soon
rid
the
country
of
foxes
,
''
cries
Western
.
``
I
think
we
*NL*
ought
to
encourage
the
recruiting
those
numbers
which
we
are
every
day
*NL*
losing
in
the
war
.
--
But
where
is
she
?
Prithee
,
Tom
,
show
me
.
''
He
then
*NL*
began
to
beat
about
,
in
the
same
language
and
in
the
same
manner
as
if
*NL*
he
had
been
beating
for
a
hare
;
and
at
last
cried
out
,
``
Soho
!
Puss
is
*NL*
not
far
off
.
Here
's
her
form
,
upon
my
soul
;
I
believe
I
may
cry
stole
*NL*
away
.
''
And
indeed
so
he
might
;
for
he
had
now
discovered
the
place
*NL*
whence
the
poor
girl
had
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
fray
,
stolen
away
,
*NL*
upon
as
many
feet
as
a
hare
generally
uses
in
travelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
now
desired
her
father
to
return
home
;
saying
she
found
herself
*NL*
very
faint
,
and
apprehended
a
relapse
.
The
squire
immediately
complied
*NL*
with
his
daughter
's
request
-LRB-
for
he
was
the
fondest
of
parents
-RRB-
.
He
*NL*
earnestly
endeavoured
to
prevail
with
the
whole
company
to
go
and
sup
*NL*
with
him
:
but
Blifil
and
Thwackum
absolutely
refused
;
the
former
*NL*
saying
,
there
were
more
reasons
than
he
could
then
mention
,
why
he
*NL*
must
decline
this
honour
;
and
the
latter
declaring
-LRB-
perhaps
rightly
-RRB-
*NL*
that
it
was
not
proper
for
a
person
of
his
function
to
be
seen
at
any
*NL*
place
in
his
present
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
incapable
of
refusing
the
pleasure
of
being
with
his
Sophia
;
*NL*
so
on
he
marched
with
Squire
Western
and
his
ladies
,
the
parson
*NL*
bringing
up
the
rear
.
This
had
,
indeed
,
offered
to
tarry
with
his
*NL*
brother
Thwackum
,
professing
his
regard
for
the
cloth
would
not
permit
*NL*
him
to
depart
;
but
Thwackum
would
not
accept
the
favour
,
and
,
with
no
*NL*
great
civility
,
pushed
him
after
Mr
Western
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
this
bloody
fray
;
and
thus
shall
end
the
fifth
book
of
this
*NL*
history

CONTAINING
ABOUT
THREE
WEEKS

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
our
last
book
we
have
been
obliged
to
deal
pretty
much
with
the
*NL*
passion
of
love
;
and
in
our
succeeding
book
shall
be
forced
to
handle
*NL*
this
subject
still
more
largely
.
It
may
not
therefore
in
this
place
be
*NL*
improper
to
apply
ourselves
to
the
examination
of
that
modern
*NL*
doctrine
,
by
which
certain
philosophers
,
among
many
other
wonderful
*NL*
discoveries
,
pretend
to
have
found
out
,
that
there
is
no
such
passion
*NL*
in
the
human
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
these
philosophers
be
the
same
with
that
surprising
sect
,
who
*NL*
are
honourably
mentioned
by
the
late
Dr
Swift
,
as
having
,
by
the
mere
*NL*
force
of
genius
alone
,
without
the
least
assistance
of
any
kind
of
*NL*
learning
,
or
even
reading
,
discovered
that
profound
and
invaluable
*NL*
secret
that
there
is
no
God
;
or
whether
they
are
not
rather
the
same
*NL*
with
those
who
some
years
since
very
much
alarmed
the
world
,
by
*NL*
showing
that
there
were
no
such
things
as
virtue
or
goodness
really
*NL*
existing
in
human
nature
,
and
who
deduced
our
best
actions
from
pride
,
*NL*
I
will
not
here
presume
to
determine
.
In
reality
,
I
am
inclined
to
*NL*
suspect
,
that
all
these
several
finders
of
truth
,
are
the
very
*NL*
identical
men
who
are
by
others
called
the
finders
of
gold
.
The
method
*NL*
used
in
both
these
searches
after
truth
and
after
gold
,
being
indeed
*NL*
one
and
the
same
,
viz.
,
the
searching
,
rummaging
,
and
examining
into
a
*NL*
nasty
place
;
indeed
,
in
the
former
instances
,
into
the
nastiest
of
all
*NL*
places
,
A
BAD
MIND
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
in
this
particular
,
and
perhaps
in
their
success
,
the
*NL*
truth-finder
and
the
gold-finder
may
very
properly
be
compared
*NL*
together
;
yet
in
modesty
,
surely
,
there
can
be
no
comparison
between
*NL*
the
two
;
for
who
ever
heard
of
a
gold-finder
that
had
the
impudence
or
*NL*
folly
to
assert
,
from
the
ill
success
of
his
search
,
that
there
was
no
*NL*
such
thing
as
gold
in
the
world
?
whereas
the
truth-finder
,
having
*NL*
raked
out
that
jakes
,
his
own
mind
,
and
being
there
capable
of
tracing
*NL*
no
ray
of
divinity
,
nor
anything
virtuous
or
good
,
or
lovely
,
or
*NL*
loving
,
very
fairly
,
honestly
,
and
logically
concludes
that
no
such
*NL*
things
exist
in
the
whole
creation
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
avoid
,
however
,
all
contention
,
if
possible
,
with
these
*NL*
philosophers
,
if
they
will
be
called
so
;
and
to
show
our
own
*NL*
disposition
to
accommodate
matters
peaceably
between
us
,
we
shall
here
*NL*
make
them
some
concessions
,
which
may
possibly
put
an
end
to
the
*NL*
dispute
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
we
will
grant
that
many
minds
,
and
perhaps
those
of
the
*NL*
philosophers
,
are
entirely
free
from
the
least
traces
of
such
a
*NL*
passion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Secondly
,
that
what
is
commonly
called
love
,
namely
,
the
desire
of
*NL*
satisfying
a
voracious
appetite
with
a
certain
quantity
of
delicate
*NL*
white
human
flesh
,
is
by
no
means
that
passion
for
which
I
here
*NL*
contend
.
This
is
indeed
more
properly
hunger
;
and
as
no
glutton
is
*NL*
ashamed
to
apply
the
word
love
to
his
appetite
,
and
to
say
he
LOVES
*NL*
such
and
such
dishes
;
so
may
the
lover
of
this
kind
,
with
equal
*NL*
propriety
,
say
,
he
HUNGERS
after
such
and
such
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thirdly
,
I
will
grant
,
which
I
believe
will
be
a
most
acceptable
*NL*
concession
,
that
this
love
for
which
I
am
an
advocate
,
though
it
*NL*
satisfies
itself
in
a
much
more
delicate
manner
,
doth
nevertheless
*NL*
seek
its
own
satisfaction
as
much
as
the
grossest
of
all
our
*NL*
appetites
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
lastly
,
that
this
love
,
when
it
operates
towards
one
of
a
*NL*
different
sex
,
is
very
apt
,
towards
its
complete
gratification
,
to
*NL*
call
in
the
aid
of
that
hunger
which
I
have
mentioned
above
;
and
which
*NL*
it
is
so
far
from
abating
,
that
it
heightens
all
its
delights
to
a
*NL*
degree
scarce
imaginable
by
those
who
have
never
been
susceptible
of
*NL*
any
other
emotions
than
what
have
proceeded
from
appetite
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
return
to
all
these
concessions
,
I
desire
of
the
philosophers
to
*NL*
grant
,
that
there
is
in
some
-LRB-
I
believe
in
many
-RRB-
human
breasts
a
kind
*NL*
and
benevolent
disposition
,
which
is
gratified
by
contributing
to
the
*NL*
happiness
of
others
.
That
in
this
gratification
alone
,
as
in
*NL*
friendship
,
in
parental
and
filial
affection
,
as
indeed
in
general
*NL*
philanthropy
,
there
is
a
great
and
exquisite
delight
.
That
if
we
will
*NL*
not
call
such
disposition
love
,
we
have
no
name
for
it
.
That
though
*NL*
the
pleasures
arising
from
such
pure
love
may
be
heightened
and
*NL*
sweetened
by
the
assistance
of
amorous
desires
,
yet
the
former
can
*NL*
subsist
alone
,
nor
are
they
destroyed
by
the
intervention
of
the
*NL*
latter
.
Lastly
,
that
esteem
and
gratitude
are
the
proper
motives
to
*NL*
love
,
as
youth
and
beauty
are
to
desire
,
and
,
therefore
,
though
such
*NL*
desire
may
naturally
cease
,
when
age
or
sickness
overtakes
its
object
;
*NL*
yet
these
can
have
no
effect
on
love
,
nor
ever
shake
or
remove
,
from
a
*NL*
good
mind
,
that
sensation
or
passion
which
hath
gratitude
and
esteem
*NL*
for
its
basis
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
deny
the
existence
of
a
passion
of
which
we
often
see
manifest
*NL*
instances
,
seems
to
be
very
strange
and
absurd
;
and
can
indeed
proceed
*NL*
only
from
that
self-admonition
which
we
have
mentioned
above
:
but
how
*NL*
unfair
is
this
!
Doth
the
man
who
recognizes
in
his
own
heart
no
traces
*NL*
of
avarice
or
ambition
,
conclude
,
therefore
,
that
there
are
no
such
*NL*
passions
in
human
nature
?
Why
will
we
not
modestly
observe
the
same
*NL*
rule
in
judging
of
the
good
,
as
well
as
the
evil
of
others
?
Or
why
,
in
*NL*
any
case
,
will
we
,
as
Shakespear
phrases
it
,
``
put
the
world
in
our
own
*NL*
person
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Predominant
vanity
is
,
I
am
afraid
,
too
much
concerned
here
.
This
is
*NL*
one
instance
of
that
adulation
which
we
bestow
on
our
own
minds
,
and
*NL*
this
almost
universally
.
For
there
is
scarce
any
man
,
how
much
soever
*NL*
he
may
despise
the
character
of
a
flatterer
,
but
will
condescend
in
*NL*
the
meanest
manner
to
flatter
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
those
therefore
I
apply
for
the
truth
of
the
above
observations
,
*NL*
whose
own
minds
can
bear
testimony
to
what
I
have
advanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Examine
your
heart
,
my
good
reader
,
and
resolve
whether
you
do
believe
*NL*
these
matters
with
me
.
If
you
do
,
you
may
now
proceed
to
their
*NL*
exemplification
in
the
following
pages
:
if
you
do
not
,
you
have
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
already
read
more
than
you
have
understood
;
and
it
would
*NL*
be
wiser
to
pursue
your
business
,
or
your
pleasures
-LRB-
such
as
they
*NL*
are
-RRB-
,
than
to
throw
away
any
more
of
your
time
in
reading
what
you
can
*NL*
neither
taste
nor
comprehend
.
To
treat
of
the
effects
of
love
to
you
,
*NL*
must
be
as
absurd
as
to
discourse
on
colours
to
a
man
born
blind
;
*NL*
since
possibly
your
idea
of
love
may
be
as
absurd
as
that
which
we
are
*NL*
told
such
blind
man
once
entertained
of
the
colour
scarlet
;
that
*NL*
colour
seemed
to
him
to
be
very
much
like
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
:
and
*NL*
love
probably
may
,
in
your
opinion
,
very
greatly
resemble
a
dish
of
*NL*
soup
,
or
a
surloin
of
roast-beef
.

The
character
of
Mrs
Western
.
Her
great
learning
and
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
world
,
and
an
instance
of
the
deep
penetration
which
she
derived
from
*NL*
those
advantages
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
hath
seen
Mr
Western
,
his
sister
,
and
daughter
,
with
young
*NL*
Jones
,
and
the
parson
,
going
together
to
Mr
Western
's
house
,
where
the
*NL*
greater
part
of
the
company
spent
the
evening
with
much
joy
and
*NL*
festivity
.
Sophia
was
indeed
the
only
grave
person
;
for
as
to
Jones
,
*NL*
though
love
had
now
gotten
entire
possession
of
his
heart
,
yet
the
*NL*
pleasing
reflection
on
Mr
Allworthy
's
recovery
,
and
the
presence
of
*NL*
his
mistress
,
joined
to
some
tender
looks
which
she
now
and
then
could
*NL*
not
refrain
from
giving
him
,
so
elevated
our
heroe
,
that
he
joined
the
*NL*
mirth
of
the
other
three
,
who
were
perhaps
as
good-humoured
people
as
*NL*
any
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
retained
the
same
gravity
of
countenance
the
next
morning
at
*NL*
breakfast
;
whence
she
retired
likewise
earlier
than
usual
,
leaving
her
*NL*
father
and
aunt
together
.
The
squire
took
no
notice
of
this
change
in
*NL*
his
daughter
's
disposition
.
To
say
the
truth
,
though
he
was
somewhat
*NL*
of
a
politician
,
and
had
been
twice
a
candidate
in
the
country
*NL*
interest
at
an
election
,
he
was
a
man
of
no
great
observation
.
His
*NL*
sister
was
a
lady
of
a
different
turn
.
She
had
lived
about
the
court
,
*NL*
and
had
seen
the
world
.
Hence
she
had
acquired
all
that
knowledge
*NL*
which
the
said
world
usually
communicates
;
and
was
a
perfect
mistress
*NL*
of
manners
,
customs
,
ceremonies
,
and
fashions
.
Nor
did
her
erudition
*NL*
stop
here
.
She
had
considerably
improved
her
mind
by
study
;
she
had
*NL*
not
only
read
all
the
modern
plays
,
operas
,
oratorios
,
poems
,
and
*NL*
romances
--
in
all
which
she
was
a
critic
;
but
had
gone
through
Rapin
's
*NL*
History
of
England
,
Eachard
's
Roman
History
,
and
many
French
_
Memoires
*NL*
pour
servir
a
l'Histoire
_
:
to
these
she
had
added
most
of
the
*NL*
political
pamphlets
and
journals
published
within
the
last
twenty
*NL*
years
.
From
which
she
had
attained
a
very
competent
skill
in
politics
,
*NL*
and
could
discourse
very
learnedly
on
the
affairs
of
Europe
.
She
was
,
*NL*
moreover
,
excellently
well
skilled
in
the
doctrine
of
amour
,
and
knew
*NL*
better
than
anybody
who
and
who
were
together
;
a
knowledge
which
she
*NL*
the
more
easily
attained
,
as
her
pursuit
of
it
was
never
diverted
by
*NL*
any
affairs
of
her
own
;
for
either
she
had
no
inclinations
,
or
they
*NL*
had
never
been
solicited
;
which
last
is
indeed
very
probable
;
for
her
*NL*
masculine
person
,
which
was
near
six
foot
high
,
added
to
her
manner
*NL*
and
learning
,
possibly
prevented
the
other
sex
from
regarding
her
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
her
petticoats
,
in
the
light
of
a
woman
.
However
,
as
*NL*
she
had
considered
the
matter
scientifically
,
she
perfectly
well
knew
,
*NL*
though
she
had
never
practised
them
,
all
the
arts
which
fine
ladies
*NL*
use
when
they
desire
to
give
encouragement
,
or
to
conceal
liking
,
with
*NL*
all
the
long
appendage
of
smiles
,
ogles
,
glances
,
&
c.
,
as
they
are
at
*NL*
present
practised
in
the
beau-monde
.
To
sum
the
whole
,
no
species
of
*NL*
disguise
or
affectation
had
escaped
her
notice
;
but
as
to
the
plain
*NL*
simple
workings
of
honest
nature
,
as
she
had
never
seen
any
such
,
she
*NL*
could
know
but
little
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
means
of
this
wonderful
sagacity
,
Mrs
Western
had
now
,
as
she
*NL*
thought
,
made
a
discovery
of
something
in
the
mind
of
Sophia
.
The
*NL*
first
hint
of
this
she
took
from
the
behaviour
of
the
young
lady
in
*NL*
the
field
of
battle
;
and
the
suspicion
which
she
then
conceived
,
was
*NL*
greatly
corroborated
by
some
observations
which
she
had
made
that
*NL*
evening
and
the
next
morning
.
However
,
being
greatly
cautious
to
avoid
*NL*
being
found
in
a
mistake
,
she
carried
the
secret
a
whole
fortnight
in
*NL*
her
bosom
,
giving
only
some
oblique
hints
,
by
simpering
,
winks
,
nods
,
*NL*
and
now
and
then
dropping
an
obscure
word
,
which
indeed
sufficiently
*NL*
alarmed
Sophia
,
but
did
not
at
all
affect
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
at
length
,
however
,
thoroughly
satisfied
of
the
truth
of
her
*NL*
observation
,
she
took
an
opportunity
,
one
morning
,
when
she
was
alone
*NL*
with
her
brother
,
to
interrupt
one
of
his
whistles
in
the
following

manner

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
brother
,
have
you
not
observed
something
very
extraordinary
in
my
*NL*
niece
lately
?
''
--
``
No
,
not
I
,
''
answered
Western
;
``
is
anything
the
matter
*NL*
with
the
girl
?
''
--
``
I
think
there
is
,
''
replied
she
;
``
and
something
of
*NL*
much
consequence
too
.
''
--
``
Why
,
she
doth
not
complain
of
anything
,
''
*NL*
cries
Western
;
``
and
she
hath
had
the
small-pox
.
''
--
``
Brother
,
''
returned
*NL*
she
,
``
girls
are
liable
to
other
distempers
besides
the
small-pox
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
possibly
to
much
worse
.
''
Here
Western
interrupted
her
with
*NL*
much
earnestness
,
and
begged
her
,
if
anything
ailed
his
daughter
,
to
*NL*
acquaint
him
immediately
;
adding
,
``
she
knew
he
loved
her
more
than
his
*NL*
own
soul
,
and
that
he
would
send
to
the
world
's
end
for
the
best
*NL*
physician
to
her
.
''
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
answered
she
,
smiling
,
``
the
distemper
*NL*
is
not
so
terrible
;
but
I
believe
,
brother
,
you
are
convinced
I
know
*NL*
the
world
,
and
I
promise
you
I
was
never
more
deceived
in
my
life
,
if
*NL*
my
niece
be
not
most
desperately
in
love
.
''
--
``
How
!
in
love
!
''
cries
*NL*
Western
,
in
a
passion
;
``
in
love
,
without
acquainting
me
!
I
'll
*NL*
disinherit
her
;
I
'll
turn
her
out
of
doors
,
stark
naked
,
without
a
*NL*
farthing

Is
all
my
kindness
vor
`
ur
,
and
vondness
o'ur
come
to
this
,
*NL*
to
fall
in
love
without
asking
me

''
--
``
But
you
will
not
,
''
*NL*
answered
Mrs
Western
,
``
turn
this
daughter
,
whom
you
love
better
than
*NL*
your
own
soul
,
out
of
doors
,
before
you
know
whether
you
shall
approve
*NL*
her
choice

Suppose
she
should
have
fixed
on
the
very
person
whom
you
*NL*
yourself
would
wish

I
hope
you
would
not
be
angry
then
?
''
--
``
No
,
no

''
*NL*
cries
Western
,
``
that
would
make
a
difference
.
If
she
marries
the
man
I
*NL*
would
ha

her

love
whom
she
pleases

I
sha
n't
trouble
my
head
*NL*
about
that

''
``
That
is
spoken
,
''
answered
the
sister
,
``
like
a
sensible
*NL*
man
;
but
I
believe
the
very
person
she
hath
chosen
would
be
the
very
*NL*
person
you
would
choose
for
her
.
I
will
disclaim
all
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
world
,
if
it
is
not
so
;

I
believe

you
will
allow
I
have
*NL*
some

''
--
``
Why

lookee
,

''
said
Western
,
``
I
do
believe
you
have
as
*NL*
much
as
any
woman
;

to
be
sure
those
are
women

matters
.
You
know
*NL*
I
do
n't
love
to
hear
you
talk
about
politics
;
they
belong
to
us
,

not
meddle

who

the
man

``
Marry

*NL*
said
she
,
``
you
may
find

You

who
are

so
great
a

can
be
at
no
great
loss

The
judgment
which
can
*NL*
penetrate
into
the
cabinets
of
princes

and
discover
the
secret
*NL*
springs
which
move
the
great
state
wheels
in
all
the
political
*NL*
machines
of
Europe
,
must
surely
,
with
very
little
difficulty

find
out
*NL*
what
passes
in
the
rude
uninformed
mind
of
a
girl

``
Sister

cries
*NL*
the
squire
,
``
I
have
often
warn

you

gibberish

I
tell

I

I
can
read
a

Perhaps

indeed

there
may
be

tan
a
verse

I

that

the

Do

answered
Western
;

the

she

in

it

the

I
am
glad
I
know

answered
the
squire
.
``
But
*NL*
we
'll
talk
more
of

another

At
present

do
tell
me

a

she

down

what
think
you
of
Mr

*NL*
Did
she
not

up

part

And
pray
what

should
be
*NL*
the
occasion
of
all
her
melancholy
that
night
at

the
next
*NL*
morning
,

indeed
ever

''
`
Fore
George
!
''
cries
the
squire
,
*NL*
``
now
you
mind
me
o
n't
,
I
remember
it
all
.
It
is
certainly
so
,
and
I
am
*NL*
glad
o
n't
with
all
my
heart
.
I
knew
Sophy
was
a
good
girl
,
and
would
*NL*
not
fall
in
love
to
make
me
angry
.
I
was
never
more
rejoiced
in
my
*NL*
life
;
for
nothing
can
lie
so
handy
together
as
our
two
estates
.
I
had
*NL*
this
matter
in
my
head
some
time
ago
:
for
certainly
the
two
estates
*NL*
are
in
a
manner
joined
together
in
matrimony
already
,
and
it
would
be
*NL*
a
thousand
pities
to
part
them
.
It
is
true
,
indeed
,
there
be
larger
*NL*
estates
in
the
kingdom
,
but
not
in
this
county
,
and
I
had
rather
bate
*NL*
something
,
than
marry
my
daughter
among
strangers
and
foreigners
.
*NL*
Besides
,
most
o

zuch
great
estates
be
in
the
hands
of
lords
,
and
I
*NL*
heate
the
very
name
of
_
themmun
_
.
Well
but
,
sister
,
what
would
you
*NL*
advise
me
to
do
;
for
I
tell
you
women
know
these
matters
better
than
*NL*
we
do
?
''
--
``
Oh
,
your
humble
servant
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
lady
:
``
we
are
*NL*
obliged
to
you
for
allowing
us
a
capacity
in
anything
.
Since
you
are
*NL*
pleased
,
then
,
most
politic
sir
,
to
ask
my
advice
,
I
think
you
may
*NL*
propose
the
match
to
Allworthy
yourself
.
There
is
no
indecorum
in
the
*NL*
proposal
's
coming
from
the
parent
of
either
side
.
King
Alcinous
,
in
Mr
*NL*
Pope
's
Odyssey
,
offers
his
daughter
to
Ulysses
.
I
need
not
caution
so
*NL*
politic
a
person
not
to
say
that
your
daughter
is
in
love
;
that
would
*NL*
indeed
be
against
all
rules
.
''
--
``
Well
,
''
said
the
squire
,
``
I
will
*NL*
propose
it
;
but
I
shall
certainly
lend
un
a
flick
,
if
he
should
refuse
*NL*
me
.
''
``
Fear
not
,
''
cries
Mrs
Western
;
``
the
match
is
too
advantageous
to
*NL*
be
refused
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
that
,
''
answered
the
squire
:
``
Allworthy
is
a
*NL*
queer
b
--
ch
,
and
money
hath
no
effect
o'un
.
''
``
Brother
,
''
said
the
lady
,
*NL*
``
your
politics
astonish
me
.
Are
you
really
to
be
imposed
on
by
*NL*
professions
?
Do
you
think
Mr
Allworthy
hath
more
contempt
for
money
*NL*
than
other
men
because
he
professes
more
?
Such
credulity
would
better
*NL*
become
one
of
us
weak
women
,
than
that
wise
sex
which
heaven
hath
*NL*
formed
for
politicians
.
Indeed
,
brother
,
you
would
make
a
fine
plenipo
*NL*
to
negotiate
with
the
French
.
They
would
soon
persuade
you
,
that
they
*NL*
take
towns
out
of
mere
defensive
principles
.
''
``
Sister
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
squire
,
with
much
scorn
,
``
let
your
friends
at
court
answer
for
the
*NL*
towns
taken
;
as
you
are
a
woman
,
I
shall
lay
no
blame
upon
you
;
for
I
*NL*
suppose
they
are
wiser
than
to
trust
women
with
secrets
.
''
He
*NL*
accompanied
this
with
so
sarcastical
a
laugh
,
that
Mrs
Western
could
*NL*
bear
no
longer
.
She
had
been
all
this
time
fretted
in
a
tender
part
*NL*
-LRB-
for
she
was
indeed
very
deeply
skilled
in
these
matters
,
and
very
*NL*
violent
in
them
-RRB-
,
and
therefore
,
burst
forth
in
a
rage
,
declared
her
*NL*
brother
to
be
both
a
clown
and
a
blockhead
,
and
that
she
would
stay
no
*NL*
longer
in
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
,
though
perhaps
he
had
never
read
Machiavel
,
was
,
however
,
*NL*
in
many
points
,
a
perfect
politician
.
He
strongly
held
all
those
wise
*NL*
tenets
,
which
are
so
well
inculcated
in
that
Politico-Peripatetic
*NL*
school
of
Exchange-alley
.
He
knew
the
just
value
and
only
use
of
*NL*
money
,
viz.
,
to
lay
it
up
.
He
was
likewise
well
skilled
in
the
exact
*NL*
value
of
reversions
,
expectations
,
&
c.
,
and
had
often
considered
the
*NL*
amount
of
his
sister
's
fortune
,
and
the
chance
which
he
or
his
*NL*
posterity
had
of
inheriting
it
.
This
he
was
infinitely
too
wise
to
*NL*
sacrifice
to
a
trifling
resentment
.
When
he
found
,
therefore
,
he
had
*NL*
carried
matters
too
far
,
he
began
to
think
of
reconciling
them
;
which
*NL*
was
no
very
difficult
task
,
as
the
lady
had
great
affection
for
her
*NL*
brother
,
and
still
greater
for
her
niece
;
and
though
too
susceptible
*NL*
of
an
affront
offered
to
her
skill
in
politics
,
on
which
she
much
*NL*
valued
herself
,
was
a
woman
of
a
very
extraordinary
good
and
sweet
*NL*
disposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
first
,
therefore
,
laid
violent
hands
on
the
horses
,
for
whose
*NL*
escape
from
the
stable
no
place
but
the
window
was
left
open
,
he
next
*NL*
applied
himself
to
his
sister
;
softened
and
soothed
her
,
by
unsaying
*NL*
all
he
had
said
,
and
by
assertions
directly
contrary
to
those
which
*NL*
had
incensed
her
.
Lastly
,
he
summoned
the
eloquence
of
Sophia
to
his
*NL*
assistance
,
who
,
besides
a
most
graceful
and
winning
address
,
had
the
*NL*
advantage
of
being
heard
with
great
favour
and
partiality
by
her
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
of
the
whole
was
a
kind
smile
from
Mrs
Western
,
who
said
,
*NL*
``
Brother
,
you
are
absolutely
a
perfect
Croat
;
but
as
those
have
their
*NL*
use
in
the
army
of
the
empress
queen
,
so
you
likewise
have
some
good
*NL*
in
you
.
I
will
therefore
once
more
sign
a
treaty
of
peace
with
you
,
*NL*
and
see
that
you
do
not
infringe
it
on
your
side
;
at
least
,
as
you
are
*NL*
so
excellent
a
politician
,
I
may
expect
you
will
keep
your
leagues
,
*NL*
like
the
French
,
till
your
interest
calls
upon
you
to
break
them

Chapter

.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
two
defiances
to
the
critics
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
having
settled
matters
with
his
sister
,
as
we
have
seen
in
*NL*
the
last
chapter
,
was
so
greatly
impatient
to
communicate
the
proposal
*NL*
to
Allworthy
,
that
Mrs
Western
had
the
utmost
difficulty
to
prevent
*NL*
him
from
visiting
that
gentleman
in
his
sickness
,
for
this
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
had
been
engaged
to
dine
with
Mr
Western
at
the
time
when
*NL*
he
was
taken
ill
.
He
was
therefore
no
sooner
discharged
out
of
the
*NL*
custody
of
physic
,
but
he
thought
-LRB-
as
was
usual
with
him
on
all
*NL*
occasions
,
both
the
highest
and
the
lowest
-RRB-
of
fulfilling
his
*NL*
engagement
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
interval
between
the
time
of
the
dialogue
in
the
last
chapter
,
*NL*
and
this
day
of
public
entertainment
,
Sophia
had
,
from
certain
obscure
*NL*
hints
thrown
out
by
her
aunt
,
collected
some
apprehension
that
the
*NL*
sagacious
lady
suspected
her
passion
for
Jones
.
She
now
resolved
to
*NL*
take
this
opportunity
of
wiping
out
all
such
suspicion
,
and
for
that
*NL*
purpose
to
put
an
entire
constraint
on
her
behaviour
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
she
endeavoured
to
conceal
a
throbbing
melancholy
heart
with
*NL*
the
utmost
sprightliness
in
her
countenance
,
and
the
highest
gaiety
in
*NL*
her
manner
.
Secondly
,
she
addressed
her
whole
discourse
to
Mr
Blifil
,
*NL*
and
took
not
the
least
notice
of
poor
Jones
the
whole
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
was
so
delighted
with
this
conduct
of
his
daughter
,
that
he
*NL*
scarce
eat
any
dinner
,
and
spent
almost
his
whole
time
in
watching
*NL*
opportunities
of
conveying
signs
of
his
approbation
by
winks
and
nods
*NL*
to
his
sister
;
who
was
not
at
first
altogether
so
pleased
with
what
*NL*
she
saw
as
was
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
Sophia
so
greatly
overacted
her
part
,
that
her
aunt
was
at
*NL*
first
staggered
,
and
began
to
suspect
some
affectation
in
her
niece
;
*NL*
but
as
she
was
herself
a
woman
of
great
art
,
so
she
soon
attributed
*NL*
this
to
extreme
art
in
Sophia
.
She
remembered
the
many
hints
she
had
*NL*
given
her
niece
concerning
her
being
in
love
,
and
imagined
the
young
*NL*
lady
had
taken
this
way
to
rally
her
out
of
her
opinion
,
by
an
*NL*
overacted
civility
:
a
notion
that
was
greatly
corroborated
by
the
*NL*
excessive
gaiety
with
which
the
whole
was
accompanied
.
We
can
not
here
*NL*
avoid
remarking
,
that
this
conjecture
would
have
been
better
founded
*NL*
had
Sophia
lived
ten
years
in
the
air
of
Grosvenor
Square
,
where
young
*NL*
ladies
do
learn
a
wonderful
knack
of
rallying
and
playing
with
that
*NL*
passion
,
which
is
a
mighty
serious
thing
in
woods
and
groves
an
*NL*
hundred
miles
distant
from
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
in
discovering
the
deceit
of
others
,
it
matters
much
*NL*
that
our
own
art
be
wound
up
,
if
I
may
use
the
expression
,
in
the
same
*NL*
key
with
theirs
:
for
very
artful
men
sometimes
miscarry
by
fancying
*NL*
others
wiser
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
greater
knaves
,
than
they
really
*NL*
are
.
As
this
observation
is
pretty
deep
,
I
will
illustrate
it
by
the
*NL*
following
short
story
.
Three
countrymen
were
pursuing
a
Wiltshire
*NL*
thief
through
Brentford
.
The
simplest
of
them
seeing
``
The
Wiltshire
*NL*
House
,
''
written
under
a
sign
,
advised
his
companions
to
enter
it
,
for
*NL*
there
most
probably
they
would
find
their
countryman
.
The
second
,
who
*NL*
was
wiser
,
laughed
at
this
simplicity
;
but
the
third
,
who
was
wiser
*NL*
still
,
answered
,
``
Let
us
go
in
,
however
,
for
he
may
think
we
should
*NL*
not
suspect
him
of
going
amongst
his
own
countrymen
.
''
They
accordingly
*NL*
went
in
and
searched
the
house
,
and
by
that
means
missed
overtaking
*NL*
the
thief
,
who
was
at
that
time
but
a
little
way
before
them
;
and
who
,
*NL*
as
they
all
knew
,
but
had
never
once
reflected
,
could
not
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
pardon
a
digression
in
which
so
invaluable
a
secret
is
*NL*
communicated
,
since
every
gamester
will
agree
how
necessary
it
is
to
*NL*
know
exactly
the
play
of
another
,
in
order
to
countermine
him
.
This
*NL*
will
,
moreover
,
afford
a
reason
why
the
wiser
man
,
as
is
often
seen
,
*NL*
is
the
bubble
of
the
weaker
,
and
why
many
simple
and
innocent
*NL*
characters
are
so
generally
misunderstood
and
misrepresented
;
but
what
*NL*
is
most
material
,
this
will
account
for
the
deceit
which
Sophia
put
on
*NL*
her
politic
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
being
ended
,
and
the
company
retired
into
the
garden
,
Mr
*NL*
Western
,
who
was
thoroughly
convinced
of
the
certainty
of
what
his
*NL*
sister
had
told
him
,
took
Mr
Allworthy
aside
,
and
very
bluntly
*NL*
proposed
a
match
between
Sophia
and
young
Mr
Blifil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
was
not
one
of
those
men
whose
hearts
flutter
at
any
*NL*
unexpected
and
sudden
tidings
of
worldly
profit
.
His
mind
was
,
indeed
,
*NL*
tempered
with
that
philosophy
which
becomes
a
man
and
a
Christian
.
He
*NL*
affected
no
absolute
superiority
to
all
pleasure
and
pain
,
to
all
joy
*NL*
and
grief
;
but
was
not
at
the
same
time
to
be
discomposed
and
ruffled
*NL*
by
every
accidental
blast
,
by
every
smile
or
frown
of
fortune
.
He
*NL*
received
,
therefore
,
Mr
Western
's
proposal
without
any
visible
*NL*
emotion
,
or
without
any
alteration
of
countenance
.
He
said
the
*NL*
alliance
was
such
as
he
sincerely
wished
;
then
launched
forth
into
a
*NL*
very
just
encomium
on
the
young
lady
's
merit
;
acknowledged
the
offer
*NL*
to
be
advantageous
in
point
of
fortune
;
and
after
thanking
Mr
Western
*NL*
for
the
good
opinion
he
had
professed
of
his
nephew
,
concluded
,
that
*NL*
if
the
young
people
liked
each
other
,
he
should
be
very
desirous
to
*NL*
complete
the
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Western
was
a
little
disappointed
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
answer
,
which
was
*NL*
not
so
warm
as
he
expected
.
He
treated
the
doubt
whether
the
young
*NL*
people
might
like
one
another
with
great
contempt
,
saying
,
``
That
*NL*
parents
were
the
best
judges
of
proper
matches
for
their
children
:
*NL*
that
for
his
part
he
should
insist
on
the
most
resigned
obedience
from
*NL*
his
daughter
:
and
if
any
young
fellow
could
refuse
such
a
bed-fellow
,
*NL*
he
was
his
humble
servant
,
and
hoped
there
was
no
harm
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
endeavoured
to
soften
this
resentment
by
many
eulogiums
on
*NL*
Sophia
,
declaring
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
Mr
Blifil
would
very
gladly
*NL*
receive
the
offer
;
but
all
was
ineffectual
;
he
could
obtain
no
other
*NL*
answer
from
the
squire
but
--
``
I
say
no
more
--
I
humbly
hope
there
's
no
*NL*
harm
done
--
that
's
all
.
''
Which
words
he
repeated
at
least
a
hundred
*NL*
times
before
they
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
was
too
well
acquainted
with
his
neighbour
to
be
offended
at
*NL*
this
behaviour
;
and
though
he
was
so
averse
to
the
rigour
which
some
*NL*
parents
exercise
on
their
children
in
the
article
of
marriage
,
that
he
*NL*
had
resolved
never
to
force
his
nephew
's
inclinations
,
he
was
*NL*
nevertheless
much
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
this
union
;
for
the
*NL*
whole
country
resounded
the
praises
of
Sophia
,
and
he
had
himself
*NL*
greatly
admired
the
uncommon
endowments
of
both
her
mind
and
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
I
believe
we
may
add
,
the
consideration
of
her
vast
fortune
,
*NL*
which
,
though
he
was
too
sober
to
be
intoxicated
with
it
,
he
was
too
*NL*
sensible
to
despise
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
,
in
defiance
of
all
the
barking
critics
in
the
world
,
I
must
*NL*
and
will
introduce
a
digression
concerning
true
wisdom
,
of
which
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
was
in
reality
as
great
a
pattern
as
he
was
of
goodness
.
*NL*
*NL*
True
wisdom
then
,
notwithstanding
all
which
Mr
Hogarth
's
poor
poet
may
*NL*
have
writ
against
riches
,
and
in
spite
of
all
which
any
rich
well-fed
*NL*
divine
may
have
preached
against
pleasure
,
consists
not
in
the
*NL*
contempt
of
either
of
these
.
A
man
may
have
as
much
wisdom
in
the
*NL*
possession
of
an
affluent
fortune
,
as
any
beggar
in
the
streets
;
or
*NL*
may
enjoy
a
handsome
wife
or
a
hearty
friend
,
and
still
remain
as
wise
*NL*
as
any
sour
popish
recluse
,
who
buries
all
his
social
faculties
,
and
*NL*
starves
his
belly
while
he
well
lashes
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
truth
,
the
wisest
man
is
the
likeliest
to
possess
all
worldly
*NL*
blessings
in
an
eminent
degree
;
for
as
that
moderation
which
wisdom
*NL*
prescribes
is
the
surest
way
to
useful
wealth
,
so
can
it
alone
qualify
*NL*
us
to
taste
many
pleasures
.
The
wise
man
gratifies
every
appetite
and
*NL*
every
passion
,
while
the
fool
sacrifices
all
the
rest
to
pall
and
*NL*
satiate
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
objected
,
that
very
wise
men
have
been
notoriously
*NL*
avaricious
.
I
answer
,
Not
wise
in
that
instance
.
It
may
likewise
be
*NL*
said
,
That
the
wisest
men
have
been
in
their
youth
immoderately
fond
*NL*
of
pleasure
.
I
answer
,
They
were
not
wise
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wisdom
,
in
short
,
whose
lessons
have
been
represented
as
so
hard
to
*NL*
learn
by
those
who
never
were
at
her
school
,
only
teaches
us
to
extend
*NL*
a
simple
maxim
universally
known
and
followed
even
in
the
lowest
life
,
*NL*
a
little
farther
than
that
life
carries
it
.
And
this
is
,
not
to
buy
at
*NL*
too
dear
a
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
whoever
takes
this
maxim
abroad
with
him
into
the
grand
market
of
*NL*
the
world
,
and
constantly
applies
it
to
honours
,
to
riches
,
to
*NL*
pleasures
,
and
to
every
other
commodity
which
that
market
affords
,
is
,
*NL*
I
will
venture
to
affirm
,
a
wise
man
,
and
must
be
so
acknowledged
in
*NL*
the
worldly
sense
of
the
word
;
for
he
makes
the
best
of
bargains
,
*NL*
since
in
reality
he
purchases
everything
at
the
price
only
of
a
little
*NL*
trouble
,
and
carries
home
all
the
good
things
I
have
mentioned
,
while
*NL*
he
keeps
his
health
,
his
innocence
,
and
his
reputation
,
the
common
*NL*
prices
which
are
paid
for
them
by
others
,
entire
and
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
moderation
,
likewise
,
he
learns
two
other
lessons
,
which
*NL*
complete
his
character
.
First
,
never
to
be
intoxicated
when
he
hath
*NL*
made
the
best
bargain
,
nor
dejected
when
the
market
is
empty
,
or
when
*NL*
its
commodities
are
too
dear
for
his
purchase
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
must
remember
on
what
subject
I
am
writing
,
and
not
trespass
too
*NL*
far
on
the
patience
of
a
good-natured
critic
.
Here
,
therefore
,
I
put
*NL*
an
end
to
the
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
sundry
curious
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Mr
Allworthy
returned
home
,
he
took
Mr
Blifil
apart
,
and
*NL*
after
some
preface
,
communicated
to
him
the
proposal
which
had
been
*NL*
made
by
Mr
Western
,
and
at
the
same
time
informed
him
how
agreeable
*NL*
this
match
would
be
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
charms
of
Sophia
had
not
made
the
least
impression
on
Blifil
;
not
*NL*
that
his
heart
was
pre-engaged
;
neither
was
he
totally
insensible
of
*NL*
beauty
,
or
had
any
aversion
to
women
;
but
his
appetites
were
by
nature
*NL*
so
moderate
,
that
he
was
able
,
by
philosophy
,
or
by
study
,
or
by
some
*NL*
other
method
,
easily
to
subdue
them
:
and
as
to
that
passion
which
we
*NL*
have
treated
of
in
the
first
chapter
of
this
book
,
he
had
not
the
*NL*
least
tincture
of
it
in
his
whole
composition
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
he
was
so
entirely
free
from
that
mixed
passion
,
of
which
*NL*
we
there
treated
,
and
of
which
the
virtues
and
beauty
of
Sophia
formed
*NL*
so
notable
an
object
;
yet
was
he
altogether
as
well
furnished
with
*NL*
some
other
passions
,
that
promised
themselves
very
full
gratification
*NL*
in
the
young
lady
's
fortune
.
Such
were
avarice
and
ambition
,
which
*NL*
divided
the
dominion
of
his
mind
between
them
.
He
had
more
than
once
*NL*
considered
the
possession
of
this
fortune
as
a
very
desirable
thing
,
*NL*
and
had
entertained
some
distant
views
concerning
it
;
but
his
own
*NL*
youth
,
and
that
of
the
young
lady
,
and
indeed
principally
a
reflection
*NL*
that
Mr
Western
might
marry
again
,
and
have
more
children
,
had
*NL*
restrained
him
from
too
hasty
or
eager
a
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
and
most
material
objection
was
now
in
great
measure
*NL*
removed
,
as
the
proposal
came
from
Mr
Western
himself
.
Blifil
,
*NL*
therefore
,
after
a
very
short
hesitation
,
answered
Mr
Allworthy
,
that
*NL*
matrimony
was
a
subject
on
which
he
had
not
yet
thought
;
but
that
he
*NL*
was
so
sensible
of
his
friendly
and
fatherly
care
,
that
he
should
in
*NL*
all
things
submit
himself
to
his
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
was
naturally
a
man
of
spirit
,
and
his
present
gravity
arose
*NL*
from
true
wisdom
and
philosophy
,
not
from
any
original
phlegm
in
his
*NL*
disposition
;
for
he
had
possessed
much
fire
in
his
youth
,
and
had
*NL*
married
a
beautiful
woman
for
love
.
He
was
not
therefore
greatly
*NL*
pleased
with
this
cold
answer
of
his
nephew
;
nor
could
he
help
*NL*
launching
forth
into
the
praises
of
Sophia
,
and
expressing
some
wonder
*NL*
that
the
heart
of
a
young
man
could
be
impregnable
to
the
force
of
*NL*
such
charms
,
unless
it
was
guarded
by
some
prior
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
assured
him
he
had
no
such
guard
;
and
then
proceeded
to
*NL*
discourse
so
wisely
and
religiously
on
love
and
marriage
,
that
he
*NL*
would
have
stopt
the
mouth
of
a
parent
much
less
devoutly
inclined
*NL*
than
was
his
uncle
.
In
the
end
,
the
good
man
was
satisfied
that
his
*NL*
nephew
,
far
from
having
any
objections
to
Sophia
,
had
that
esteem
for
*NL*
her
,
which
in
sober
and
virtuous
minds
is
the
sure
foundation
of
*NL*
friendship
and
love
.
And
as
he
doubted
not
but
the
lover
would
,
in
a
*NL*
little
time
,
become
altogether
as
agreeable
to
his
mistress
,
he
*NL*
foresaw
great
happiness
arising
to
all
parties
by
so
proper
and
*NL*
desirable
an
union
.
With
Mr
Blifil
's
consent
therefore
he
wrote
the
*NL*
next
morning
to
Mr
Western
,
acquainting
him
that
his
nephew
had
very
*NL*
thankfully
and
gladly
received
the
proposal
,
and
would
be
ready
to
*NL*
wait
on
the
young
lady
,
whenever
she
should
be
pleased
to
accept
his
*NL*
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Western
was
much
pleased
with
this
letter
,
and
immediately
returned
an
*NL*
answer
;
in
which
,
without
having
mentioned
a
word
to
his
daughter
,
he
*NL*
appointed
that
very
afternoon
for
opening
the
scene
of
courtship
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
had
dispatched
this
messenger
,
he
went
in
quest
of
his
*NL*
sister
,
whom
he
found
reading
and
expounding
the
_
Gazette
_
to
parson
*NL*
Supple
.
To
this
exposition
he
was
obliged
to
attend
near
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
,
though
with
great
violence
to
his
natural
impetuosity
,
before
*NL*
he
was
suffered
to
speak
.
At
length
,
however
,
he
found
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
acquainting
the
lady
,
that
he
had
business
of
great
consequence
to
*NL*
impart
to
her
;
to
which
she
answered
,
``
Brother
,
I
am
entirely
at
your
*NL*
service
.
Things
look
so
well
in
the
north
,
that
I
was
never
in
a
*NL*
better
humour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
parson
then
withdrawing
,
Western
acquainted
her
with
all
which
had
*NL*
passed
,
and
desired
her
to
communicate
the
affair
to
Sophia
,
which
she
*NL*
readily
and
chearfully
undertook
;
though
perhaps
her
brother
was
a
*NL*
little
obliged
to
that
agreeable
northern
aspect
which
had
so
*NL*
delighted
her
,
that
he
heard
no
comment
on
his
proceedings
;
for
they
*NL*
were
certainly
somewhat
too
hasty
and
violent
.

*NL*
*NL*
In
which
is
related
what
passed
between
Sophia
and
her
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
was
in
her
chamber
,
reading
,
when
her
aunt
came
in
.
The
moment
*NL*
she
saw
Mrs
Western
,
she
shut
the
book
with
so
much
eagerness
,
that
*NL*
the
good
lady
could
not
forbear
asking
her
,
What
book
that
was
which
*NL*
she
seemed
so
much
afraid
of
showing
?
``
Upon
my
word
,
madam
,
''
answered
*NL*
Sophia
,
``
it
is
a
book
which
I
am
neither
ashamed
nor
afraid
to
own
I
*NL*
have
read
.
It
is
the
production
of
a
young
lady
of
fashion
,
whose
good
*NL*
understanding
,
I
think
,
doth
honour
to
her
sex
,
and
whose
good
heart
*NL*
is
an
honour
to
human
nature
.
''
Mrs
Western
then
took
up
the
book
,
and
*NL*
immediately
after
threw
it
down
,
saying
--
``
Yes
,
the
author
is
of
a
very
*NL*
good
family
;
but
she
is
not
much
among
people
one
knows
.
I
have
never
*NL*
read
it
;
for
the
best
judges
say
,
there
is
not
much
in
it
.
''
--
``
I
dare
*NL*
not
,
madam
,
set
up
my
own
opinion
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
against
the
best
*NL*
judges
,
but
there
appears
to
me
a
great
deal
of
human
nature
in
it
;
*NL*
and
in
many
parts
so
much
true
tenderness
and
delicacy
,
that
it
hath
*NL*
cost
me
many
a
tear
.
''
--
``
Ay
,
and
do
you
love
to
cry
then
?
''
says
the
*NL*
aunt
.
``
I
love
a
tender
sensation
,
''
answered
the
niece
,
``
and
would
pay
*NL*
the
price
of
a
tear
for
it
at
any
time
.
''
--
``
Well
,
but
show
me
,
''
said
*NL*
the
aunt
,
``
what
was
you
reading
when
I
came
in
;
there
was
something
*NL*
very
tender
in
that
,
I
believe
,
and
very
loving
too
.
You
blush
,
my
*NL*
dear
Sophia
.
Ah
!
child
,
you
should
read
books
which
would
teach
you
a
*NL*
little
hypocrisy
,
which
would
instruct
you
how
to
hide
your
thoughts
a
*NL*
little
better
.
''
--
``
I
hope
,
madam
,
''
answered
Sophia
,
``
I
have
no
thoughts
*NL*
which
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
discovering
.
''
--
``
Ashamed
!
no
,
''
cries
the
*NL*
aunt
,
``
I
do
n't
think
you
have
any
thoughts
which
you
ought
to
be
*NL*
ashamed
of
;
and
yet
,
child
,
you
blushed
just
now
when
I
mentioned
the
*NL*
word
loving
.
Dear
Sophy
,
be
assured
you
have
not
one
thought
which
I
*NL*
am
not
well
acquainted
with
;
as
well
,
child
,
as
the
French
are
with
*NL*
our
motions
,
long
before
we
put
them
in
execution
.
Did
you
think
,
*NL*
child
,
because
you
have
been
able
to
impose
upon
your
father
,
that
you
*NL*
could
impose
upon
me
?
Do
you
imagine
I
did
not
know
the
reason
of
your
*NL*
overacting
all
that
friendship
for
Mr
Blifil
yesterday
?
I
have
seen
a
*NL*
little
too
much
of
the
world
,
to
be
so
deceived
.
Nay
,
nay
,
do
not
*NL*
blush
again
.
I
tell
you
it
is
a
passion
you
need
not
be
ashamed
of
.
It
*NL*
is
a
passion
I
myself
approve
,
and
have
already
brought
your
father
*NL*
into
the
approbation
of
it
.
Indeed
,
I
solely
consider
your
*NL*
inclination
;
for
I
would
always
have
that
gratified
,
if
possible
,
*NL*
though
one
may
sacrifice
higher
prospects
.
Come
,
I
have
news
which
*NL*
will
delight
your
very
soul
.
Make
me
your
confident
,
and
I
will
*NL*
undertake
you
shall
be
happy
to
the
very
extent
of
your
wishes
.

``
La

says
Sophia

looking
more
foolishly
than
ever
she
did
in
her
*NL*
life
,
``
I
know
not
what
to

why

should
you
suspect
?

``
Nay

returned
Mrs

.
``
Consider

one

I

are
convinced

are
only
revealing

me
what
I

I
plainly
saw

artful
of

deceived

this

afternoon

I

acquainted

with
the
passion

I
first
discovered
in
you
that
*NL*
evening
when
you
fainted
away
in
the
field

I
saw
it
in
your
fainting
.

I
saw
it
immediately

next

Well

I
no

immediately
wanted

Sophia
turned
*NL*
instantly
pale
at

faintly
repeated
it

Upon

the

cried

of

Sure

Mrs
Western
*NL*
now
stood
a
few
moments
silent
,
while
sparks
of
fiery
rage
flashed
*NL*
from
her
eyes
.
At
length
,
collecting
all
her
force
of
voice
,
she
*NL*
thundered
forth
in
the
following
articulate
sounds
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
it
possible
you
can
think
of
disgracing
your
family
by
allying
*NL*
yourself
to
a
bastard
?
Can
the
blood
of
the
Westerns
submit
to
such
*NL*
contamination
?
If
you
have
not
sense
sufficient
to
restrain
such
*NL*
monstrous
inclinations
,
I
thought
the
pride
of
our
family
would
have
*NL*
prevented
you
from
giving
the
least
encouragement
to
so
base
an
*NL*
affection

much
less
did
I
imagine
you
would
ever
have
had
the
*NL*
assurance
to
own
it
to
my
face

*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam

''
answered
Sophia
,
trembling
,
``
what
I
have
said
you
have
*NL*
extorted
from

I
do
not
remember
to

ever

with
approbation
to
any
one
before

nor
should
I
now
had
I
*NL*
not
conceived

Whatever
were
my

that
poor

unhappy
young
man

I
intended
to
have
carried
them
with

my
grave

to
that
grave

only
now
,
I
find
,
I
am
to

repose

Here
she
sunk
down
in
her
chair
,
drowned
in
her
tears
,
and
,
*NL*
in
all
the
moving
silence
of
unutterable
grief
,
presented
a
spectacle
*NL*
which
must
have
affected
almost
the
hardest
heart

*NL*
*NL*
All
this
tender
sorrow
,
however

raised
no
compassion
in
her
aunt

On
*NL*
the
contrary

she
now
fell
into
the
most
violent
rage

``

I
would
*NL*
rather

she
cried
,
in
a
most
vehement
voice

``

a

Miss
Western

here
she
ran
on
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
,
*NL*
till
,
having
exhausted
her
breath
rather
than
her
rage
,
she
concluded
*NL*
with
threatening
to
go
immediately
and
acquaint
her
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
then
threw
herself
at
her
feet
,
and
laying
hold
of
her
hands
,
*NL*
begged
her
with
tears
to
conceal
what
she
had
drawn
from
her
;
urging
*NL*
the
violence
of
her
father
's
temper
,
and
protesting
that
no
*NL*
inclinations
of
hers
should
ever
prevail
with
her
to
do
anything
which
*NL*
might
offend
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
stood
a
moment
looking
at
her
,
and
then
,
having
*NL*
recollected
herself
,
said
,
``
That
on
one
consideration
only
she
would

keep
the
secret
from

this
was

should
*NL*
promise
to
entertain
Mr

that
very
afternoon
as
her
lover

to
regard
him
as

*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Sophia
was
too
much
in
her

deny
her
anything

positively
;

was
obliged
to
promise
that
she
would
see
Mr

*NL*

be
as
civil
to
him
as
possible
;
but
begged
her
aunt
that
the
match
*NL*
might
not
be
hurried
on
.
She
said
,
``
Mr
Blifil
was
by
no

agreeable

make
her
the
most
wretched
of

*NL*
Mrs

assured
her
,
``

match
was
entirely
agreed
upon

that
nothing

should
prevent
it

own

said
she
,
``
I
*NL*
looked
on

scruples
about
it
before

were
actually
got
over
by
my
thinking

it
highly
agreeable
to
your

inclinations

now
I
regard
it
as

the
most

Sophia
replied

may
expect

deceived

persuade

bad

to
make
her
an
answer
.
However
,
she
took
a
resolution
to
see
Mr
*NL*
Blifil
,
and
to
behave
to
him
as
civilly
as
she
could
,
for
on
that
*NL*
condition
only
she
obtained
a
promise
from
her
aunt
to
keep
secret
the
*NL*
liking
which
her
ill
fortune
,
rather
than
any
scheme
of
Mrs
Western
,
*NL*
had
unhappily
drawn
from
her
.

Chapter
vi

*NL*
*NL*
Containing
a
dialogue
between
Sophia
and
Mrs
Honour
,
which
may
a
*NL*
little
relieve
those
tender
affections
which
the
foregoing
scene
may
*NL*
have
raised
in
the
mind
of
a
good-natured
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
having
obtained
that
promise
from
her
niece
which
we
have
*NL*
seen
in
the
last
chapter
,
withdrew
;
and
presently
after
arrived
Mrs
*NL*
Honour
.
She
was
at
work
in
a
neighbouring
apartment
,
and
had
been
*NL*
summoned
to
the
keyhole
by
some
vociferation
in
the
preceding
*NL*
dialogue
,
where
she
had
continued
during
the
remaining
part
of
it
.
At
*NL*
her
entry
into
the
room
,
she
found
Sophia
standing
motionless
,
with
*NL*
the
tears
trickling
from
her
eyes
.
Upon
which
she
immediately
ordered
*NL*
a
proper
quantity
of
tears
into
her
own
eyes
,
and
then
began
,
``
O
*NL*
Gemini
,
my
dear
lady
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
--
``
Nothing
,
''
cries
Sophia
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
!
O
dear
Madam
!
''
answers
Honour
,
``
you
must
not
tell
me
that
,
*NL*
when
your
ladyship
is
in
this
taking
,
and
when
there
hath
been
such
a
*NL*
preamble
between
your
ladyship
and
Madam
Western
.
''
--
``
Do
n't
teaze
me
,
''
*NL*
cries
Sophia
;
``
I
tell
you
nothing
is
the
matter
.
Good
heavens
!
why
was
*NL*
I
born
?
''
--
``
Nay
,
madam
,
''
says
Mrs
Honour
,
``
you
shall
never
persuade
me
*NL*
that
your
la
`
ship
can
lament
yourself
so
for
nothing
.
To
be
sure
I
am
*NL*
but
a
servant
;
but
to
be
sure
I
have
been
always
faithful
to
your
*NL*
la
`
ship
,
and
to
be
sure
I
would
serve
your
la
`
ship
with
my
life
.
''
--
``
My
*NL*
dear
Honour
,
''
says
Sophia
,
''
't
is
not
in
thy
power
to
be
of
any
service
*NL*
to
me
.
I
am
irretrievably
undone
.
''
--
``
Heaven
forbid
!
''
answered
the
*NL*
waiting-woman
;
``
but
if
I
ca
n't
be
of
any
service
to
you
,
pray
tell
me
,
*NL*
madam
--
it
will
be
some
comfort
to
me
to
know
--
pray
,
dear
ma'am
,
tell
*NL*
me
what
's
the
matter
.
''
--
``
My
father
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
``
is
going
to
marry
*NL*
me
to
a
man
I
both
despise
and
hate
.
''
--
``
O
dear
,
ma'am
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
other
,
``
who
is
this
wicked
man
?
for
to
be
sure
he
is
very
bad
,
or
your
*NL*
la
`
ship
would
not
despise
him
.
''
--
``
His
name
is
poison
to
my
tongue
,
''
*NL*
replied
Sophia
:
``
thou
wilt
know
it
too
soon
.
''
Indeed
,
to
confess
the
*NL*
truth
,
she
knew
it
already
,
and
therefore
was
not
very
inquisitive
as
*NL*
to
that
point
.
She
then
proceeded
thus
:
``
I
do
n't
pretend
to
give
your
*NL*
la
`
ship
advice
,
whereof
your
la
`
ship
knows
much
better
than
I
can
*NL*
pretend
to
,
being
but
a
servant
;
but
,
i-fackins
!
no
father
in
England
*NL*
should
marry
me
against
my
consent
.
And
,
to
be
sure
,
the
`
squire
is
so
*NL*
good
,
that
if
he
did
but
know
your
la
`
ship
despises
and
hates
the
*NL*
young
man
,
to
be
sure
he
would
not
desire
you
to
marry
him
.
And
if
*NL*
your
la
`
ship
would
but
give
me
leave
to
tell
my
master
so
.
To
be
sure
,
*NL*
it
would
be
more
properer
to
come
from
your
own
mouth
;
but
as
your
*NL*
la
`
ship
doth
not
care
to
foul
your
tongue
with
his
nasty
name
--
''
--
``
You
*NL*
are
mistaken
,
Honour
,
''
says
Sophia
;
``
my
father
was
determined
before
*NL*
he
ever
thought
fit
to
mention
it
to
me
.
''
--
``
More
shame
for
him
,
''
cries
*NL*
Honour
:
``
you
are
to
go
to
bed
to
him
,
and
not
master
:
and
thof
a
man
*NL*
may
be
a
very
proper
man
,
yet
every
woman
may
n't
think
him
handsome
*NL*
alike
.
I
am
sure
my
master
would
never
act
in
this
manner
of
his
own
*NL*
head
.
I
wish
some
people
would
trouble
themselves
only
with
what
*NL*
belongs
to
them
;
they
would
not
,
I
believe
,
like
to
be
served
so
,
if
*NL*
it
was
their
own
case
;
for
though
I
am
a
maid
,
I
can
easily
believe
as
*NL*
how
all
men
are
not
equally
agreeable
.
And
what
signifies
your
la
`
ship
*NL*
having
so
great
a
fortune
,
if
you
ca
n't
please
yourself
with
the
man
*NL*
you
think
most
handsomest
?
Well
,
I
say
nothing
;
but
to
be
sure
it
is
a
*NL*
pity
some
folks
had
not
been
better
born
;
nay
,
as
for
that
matter
,
I
*NL*
should
not
mind
it
myself
;
but
then
there
is
not
so
much
money
;
and
*NL*
what
of
that
?
your
la
`
ship
hath
money
enough
for
both
;
and
where
can
*NL*
your
la
`
ship
bestow
your
fortune
better
?
for
to
be
sure
every
one
must
*NL*
allow
that
he
is
the
most
handsomest
,
charmingest
,
finest
,
tallest
,
*NL*
properest
man
in
the
world
.
''
--
``
What
do
you
mean
by
running
on
in
this
*NL*
manner
to
me
?
''
cries
Sophia
,
with
a
very
grave
countenance
.
``
Have
I
*NL*
ever
given
any
encouragement
for
these
liberties
?
''
--
``
Nay
,
ma'am
,
I
ask
*NL*
pardon
;
I
meant
no
harm
,
''
answered
she
;
``
but
to
be
sure
the
poor
*NL*
gentleman
hath
run
in
my
head
ever
since
I
saw
him
this
morning
.
To
be
*NL*
sure
,
if
your
la
`
ship
had
but
seen
him
just
now
,
you
must
have
pitied
*NL*
him
.
Poor
gentleman
!
I
wishes
some
misfortune
hath
not
happened
to
*NL*
him
;
for
he
hath
been
walking
about
with
his
arms
across
,
and
looking
*NL*
so
melancholy
,
all
this
morning
:
I
vow
and
protest
it
made
me
almost
*NL*
cry
to
see
him
.
''
--
``
To
see
whom
?
''
says
Sophia
.
``
Poor
Mr
Jones
,
''
*NL*
answered
Honour
.
``
See
him
!
why
,
where
did
you
see
him
?
''
cries
Sophia
.
*NL*
``
By
the
canal
,
ma'am
,
''
says
Honour
.
``
There
he
hath
been
walking
all
*NL*
this
morning
,
and
at
last
there
he
laid
himself
down
:
I
believe
he
*NL*
lies
there
still
.
To
be
sure
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
modesty
,
being
*NL*
a
maid
,
as
I
am
,
I
should
have
gone
and
spoke
to
him
.
Do
,
ma'am
,
let
*NL*
me
go
and
see
,
only
for
a
fancy
,
whether
he
is
there
still
.
''
--
``
Pugh
!
''
*NL*
says
Sophia
.
``
There
!
no
,
no
:
what
should
he
do
there
?
He
is
gone
*NL*
before
this
time

to
be
sure
.
Besides
,
why
--
what
--
why
should
you
go
to
*NL*
see
?
besides
,
I
want
you
for
something
else
.
Go
,
fetch
me
my
hat
and
*NL*
gloves
.
I
shall
walk
with
my
aunt
in
the
grove
before
dinner
.
''
Honour
*NL*
did
immediately
as
she
was
bid
,
and
Sophia
put
her
hat
on
;
when
,
*NL*
looking
in
the
glass
,
she
fancied
the
ribbon
with
which
her
hat
was
*NL*
tied
did
not
become
her
,
and
so
sent
her
maid
back
again
for
a
ribbon
*NL*
of
a
different
colour
;
and
then
giving
Mrs
Honour
repeated
charges
not
*NL*
to
leave
her
work
on
any
account
,
as
she
said
it
was
in
violent
haste
,
*NL*
and
must
be
finished
that
very
day
,
she
muttered
something
more
about
*NL*
going
to
the
grove
,
and
then
sallied
out
the
contrary
way
,
and
walked
,
*NL*
as
fast
as
her
tender
trembling
limbs
could
carry
her
,
directly
*NL*
towards
the
canal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
been
there
as
Mrs
Honour
had
told
her
;
he
had
indeed
spent
*NL*
two
hours
there
that
morning
in
melancholy
contemplation
on
his
*NL*
Sophia
,
and
had
gone
out
from
the
garden
at
one
door
the
moment
she
*NL*
entered
it
at
another
.
So
that
those
unlucky
minutes
which
had
been
*NL*
spent
in
changing
the
ribbons
,
had
prevented
the
lovers
from
meeting
*NL*
at
this
time
;
--
a
most
unfortunate
accident
,
from
which
my
fair
readers
*NL*
will
not
fail
to
draw
a
very
wholesome
lesson
.
And
here
I
strictly
*NL*
forbid
all
male
critics
to
intermeddle
with
a
circumstance
which
I
*NL*
have
recounted
only
for
the
sake
of
the
ladies
,
and
upon
which
they
*NL*
only
are
at
liberty
to
comment
.

Chapter
vii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
picture
of
formal
courtship
in
miniature
,
as
it
always
ought
to
be
*NL*
drawn
,
and
a
scene
of
a
tenderer
kind
painted
at
full
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
well
remarked
by
one
-LRB-
and
perhaps
by
more
-RRB-
,
that
misfortunes
do
*NL*
not
come
single
.
This
wise
maxim
was
now
verified
by
Sophia
,
who
was
*NL*
not
only
disappointed
of
seeing
the
man
she
loved
,
but
had
the
*NL*
vexation
of
being
obliged
to
dress
herself
out
,
in
order
to
receive
a
*NL*
visit
from
the
man
she
hated
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
afternoon
Mr
Western
,
for
the
first
time
,
acquainted
his
daughter
*NL*
with
his
intention
;
telling
her
,
he
knew
very
well
that
she
had
heard
*NL*
it
before
from
her
aunt
.
Sophia
looked
very
grave
upon
this
,
nor
could
*NL*
she
prevent
a
few
pearls
from
stealing
into
her
eyes
.
``
Come
,
come
,
''
*NL*
says
Western
,
``
none
of
your
maidenish
airs
;
I
know
all
;
I
assure
you
*NL*
sister
hath
told
me
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
possible
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
that
my
aunt
can
have
betrayed
me
*NL*
already
?
''
--
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
says
Western
;
``
betrayed
you
!
ay
.
Why
,
you
*NL*
betrayed
yourself
yesterday
at
dinner
.
You
showed
your
fancy
very
*NL*
plainly
,
I
think
.
But
you
young
girls
never
know
what
you
would
be
at
.
*NL*
So
you
cry
because
I
am
going
to
marry
you
to
the
man
you
are
in
love
*NL*
with
!
Your
mother
,
I
remember
,
whimpered
and
whined
just
in
the
same
*NL*
manner
;
but
it
was
all
over
within
twenty-four
hours
after
we
were
*NL*
married
:
Mr
Blifil
is
a
brisk
young
man
,
and
will
soon
put
an
end
to
*NL*
your
squeamishness
.
Come
,
chear
up
,
chear
up
;
I
expect
un
every
*NL*
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
was
now
convinced
that
her
aunt
had
behaved
honourably
to
her
:
*NL*
and
she
determined
to
go
through
that
disagreeable
afternoon
with
as
*NL*
much
resolution
as
possible
,
and
without
giving
the
least
suspicion
in
*NL*
the
world
to
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Blifil
soon
arrived
;
and
Mr
Western
soon
after
withdrawing
,
left
*NL*
the
young
couple
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
a
long
silence
of
near
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ensued
;
for
the
*NL*
gentleman
who
was
to
begin
the
conversation
had
all
the
unbecoming
*NL*
modesty
which
consists
in
bashfulness
.
He
often
attempted
to
speak
,
*NL*
and
as
often
suppressed
his
words
just
at
the
very
point
of
utterance
.
*NL*
At
last
out
they
broke
in
a
torrent
of
far-fetched
and
high-strained
*NL*
compliments
,
which
were
answered
on
her
side
by
downcast
looks
,
half
*NL*
bows
,
and
civil
monosyllables
.
Blifil
,
from
his
inexperience
in
the
*NL*
ways
of
women
,
and
from
his
conceit
of
himself
,
took
this
behaviour
*NL*
for
a
modest
assent
to
his
courtship
;
and
when
,
to
shorten
a
scene
*NL*
which
she
could
no
longer
support
,
Sophia
rose
up
and
left
the
room
,
*NL*
he
imputed
that
,
too
,
merely
to
bashfulness
,
and
comforted
himself
*NL*
that
he
should
soon
have
enough
of
her
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
indeed
perfectly
well
satisfied
with
his
prospect
of
success
;
*NL*
for
as
to
that
entire
and
absolute
possession
of
the
heart
of
his
*NL*
mistress
which
romantic
lovers
require
,
the
very
idea
of
it
never
*NL*
entered
his
head
.
Her
fortune
and
her
person
were
the
sole
objects
of
*NL*
his
wishes
,
of
which
he
made
no
doubt
soon
to
obtain
the
absolute
*NL*
property
;
as
Mr
Western
's
mind
was
so
earnestly
bent
on
the
match
;
and
*NL*
as
he
well
knew
the
strict
obedience
which
Sophia
was
always
ready
to
*NL*
pay
to
her
father
's
will
,
and
the
greater
still
which
her
father
would
*NL*
exact
,
if
there
was
occasion
.
This
authority
,
therefore
,
together
with
*NL*
the
charms
which
he
fancied
in
his
own
person
and
conversation
,
could
*NL*
not
fail
,
he
thought
,
of
succeeding
with
a
young
lady
,
whose
*NL*
inclinations
were
,
he
doubted
not
,
entirely
disengaged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Jones
he
certainly
had
not
even
the
least
jealousy
;
and
I
have
*NL*
often
thought
it
wonderful
that
he
had
not
.
Perhaps
he
imagined
the
*NL*
character
which
Jones
bore
all
over
the
country
-LRB-
how
justly
,
let
the
*NL*
reader
determine
-RRB-
,
of
being
one
of
the
wildest
fellows
in
England
,
*NL*
might
render
him
odious
to
a
lady
of
the
most
exemplary
modesty
.
*NL*
Perhaps
his
suspicions
might
be
laid
asleep
by
the
behaviour
of
*NL*
Sophia
,
and
of
Jones
himself
,
when
they
were
all
in
company
together
.
*NL*
Lastly
,
and
indeed
principally
,
he
was
well
assured
there
was
not
*NL*
another
self
in
the
case
.
He
fancied
that
he
knew
Jones
to
the
bottom
,
*NL*
and
had
in
reality
a
great
contempt
for
his
understanding
,
for
not
*NL*
being
more
attached
to
his
own
interest
.
He
had
no
apprehension
that
*NL*
Jones
was
in
love
with
Sophia
;
and
as
for
any
lucrative
motives
,
he
*NL*
imagined
they
would
sway
very
little
with
so
silly
a
fellow
.
Blifil
,
*NL*
moreover
,
thought
the
affair
of
Molly
Seagrim
still
went
on
,
and
*NL*
indeed
believed
it
would
end
in
marriage
;
for
Jones
really
loved
him
*NL*
from
his
childhood
,
and
had
kept
no
secret
from
him
,
till
his
*NL*
behaviour
on
the
sickness
of
Mr
Allworthy
had
entirely
alienated
his
*NL*
heart
;
and
it
was
by
means
of
the
quarrel
which
had
ensued
on
this
*NL*
occasion
,
and
which
was
not
yet
reconciled
,
that
Mr
Blifil
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
the
alteration
which
had
happened
in
the
affection
which
*NL*
Jones
had
formerly
borne
towards
Molly
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
these
reasons
,
therefore
,
Mr
Blifil
saw
no
bar
to
his
success
*NL*
with
Sophia
.
He
concluded
her
behaviour
was
like
that
of
all
other
*NL*
young
ladies
on
a
first
visit
from
a
lover
,
and
it
had
indeed
entirely
*NL*
answered
his
expectations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
took
care
to
way-lay
the
lover
at
his
exit
from
his
*NL*
mistress
.
He
found
him
so
elevated
with
his
success
,
so
enamoured
with
*NL*
his
daughter
,
and
so
satisfied
with
her
reception
of
him
,
that
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
began
to
caper
and
dance
about
his
hall
,
and
by
many
other
*NL*
antic
actions
to
express
the
extravagance
of
his
joy
;
for
he
had
not
*NL*
the
least
command
over
any
of
his
passions
;
and
that
which
had
at
any
*NL*
time
the
ascendant
in
his
mind
hurried
him
to
the
wildest
excesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Blifil
was
departed
,
which
was
not
till
after
many
hearty
*NL*
kisses
and
embraces
bestowed
on
him
by
Western
,
the
good
squire
went
*NL*
instantly
in
quest
of
his
daughter
,
whom
he
no
sooner
found
than
he
*NL*
poured
forth
the
most
extravagant
raptures
,
bidding
her
chuse
what
*NL*
clothes
and
jewels
she
pleased
;
and
declaring
that
he
had
no
other
use
*NL*
for
fortune
but
to
make
her
happy
.
He
then
caressed
her
again
and
*NL*
again
with
the
utmost
profusion
of
fondness
,
called
her
by
the
most
*NL*
endearing
names
,
and
protested
she
was
his
only
joy
on
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
perceiving
her
father
in
this
fit
of
affection
,
which
she
did
*NL*
not
absolutely
know
the
reason
of
-LRB-
for
fits
of
fondness
were
not
*NL*
unusual
to
him
,
though
this
was
rather
more
violent
than
ordinary
-RRB-
,
*NL*
thought
she
should
never
have
a
better
opportunity
of
disclosing
*NL*
herself
than
at
present
,
as
far
at
least
as
regarded
Mr
Blifil
;
and
*NL*
she
too
well
foresaw
the
necessity
which
she
should
soon
be
under
of
*NL*
coming
to
a
full
explanation
.
After
having
thanked
the
squire
,
*NL*
therefore
,
for
all
his
professions
of
kindness
,
she
added
,
with
a
look
*NL*
full
of
inexpressible
softness
,
``
And
is
it
possible
my
papa
can
be
so
*NL*
good
to
place
all
his
joy
in
his
Sophy
's
happiness
?
''
which
Western
*NL*
having
confirmed
by
a
great
oath
,
and
a
kiss
;
she
then
laid
hold
of
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
,
falling
on
her
knees
,
after
many
warm
and
passionate
*NL*
declarations
of
affection
and
duty
,
she
begged
him
``
not
to
make
her
*NL*
the
most
miserable
creature
on
earth
by
forcing
her
to
marry
a
man
*NL*
whom
she
detested
.
This
I
entreat
of
you
,
dear
sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
for
*NL*
your
sake
,
as
well
as
my
own
,
since
you
are
so
very
kind
to
tell
me
*NL*
your
happiness
depends
on
mine
.
''
--
``
How
!
what
!
''
says
Western
,
staring
*NL*
wildly
.
``
Oh
!
sir
,
''
continued
she
,
``
not
only
your
poor
Sophy
's
*NL*
happiness
;
her
very
life
,
her
being
,
depends
upon
your
granting
her
*NL*
request
.
I
can
not
live
with
Mr
Blifil
.
To
force
me
into
this
marriage
*NL*
would
be
killing
me
.
''
--
``
You
ca
n't
live
with
Mr
Blifil
?
''
says
Western
.
*NL*
``
No
,
upon
my
soul
I
ca
n't
,
''
answered
Sophia
.
``
Then
die
and
be
d
--
d
,
''
*NL*
cries
he
,
spurning
her
from
him
.
``
Oh
!
sir
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
catching
*NL*
hold
of
the
skirt
of
his
coat
,
``
take
pity
on
me
,
I
beseech
you
.
Do
n't
*NL*
look
and
say
such
cruel
--
Can
you
be
unmoved
while
you
see
your
Sophy
*NL*
in
this
dreadful
condition
?
Can
the
best
of
fathers
break
my
heart
?
*NL*
Will
he
kill
me
by
the
most
painful
,
cruel
,
lingering
death
?
''
--
``
Pooh
!
*NL*
pooh
!
''
cries
the
squire
;
``
all
stuff
and
nonsense
;
all
maidenish
*NL*
tricks
.
Kill
you
,
indeed
!
Will
marriage
kill
you
?
''
--
``
Oh
!
sir
,
''
*NL*
answered
Sophia
,
``
such
a
marriage
is
worse
than
death
.
He
is
not
even
*NL*
indifferent
;
I
hate
and
detest
him
.
''
--
``
If
you
detest
un
never
so
*NL*
much
,
''
cries
Western
,
``
you
shall
ha'un
.
''
This
he
bound
by
an
oath
too
*NL*
shocking
to
repeat
;
and
after
many
violent
asseverations
,
concluded
in
*NL*
these
words
:
``
I
am
resolved
upon
the
match
,
and
unless
you
consent
to
*NL*
it
I
will
not
give
you
a
groat
,
not
a
single
farthing
;
no
,
though
I
*NL*
saw
you
expiring
with
famine
in
the
street
,
I
would
not
relieve
you
*NL*
with
a
morsel
of
bread
.
This
is
my
fixed
resolution
,
and
so
I
leave
*NL*
you
to
consider
on
it
.
''
He
then
broke
from
her
with
such
violence
,
*NL*
that
her
face
dashed
against
the
floor
;
and
he
burst
directly
out
of
*NL*
the
room
,
leaving
poor
Sophia
prostrate
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Western
came
into
the
hall
,
he
there
found
Jones
;
who
seeing
his
*NL*
friend
looking
wild
,
pale
,
and
almost
breathless
,
could
not
forbear
*NL*
enquiring
the
reason
of
all
these
melancholy
appearances
.
Upon
which
*NL*
the
squire
immediately
acquainted
him
with
the
whole
matter
,
*NL*
concluding
with
bitter
denunciations
against
Sophia
,
and
very
pathetic
*NL*
lamentations
of
the
misery
of
all
fathers
who
are
so
unfortunate
to
*NL*
have
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
to
whom
all
the
resolutions
which
had
been
taken
in
favour
of
*NL*
Blifil
were
yet
a
secret
,
was
at
first
almost
struck
dead
with
this
*NL*
relation
;
but
recovering
his
spirits
a
little
,
mere
despair
,
as
he
*NL*
afterwards
said
,
inspired
him
to
mention
a
matter
to
Mr
Western
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
require
more
impudence
than
a
human
forehead
was
ever
gifted
*NL*
with
.
He
desired
leave
to
go
to
Sophia
,
that
he
might
endeavour
to
*NL*
obtain
her
concurrence
with
her
father
's
inclinations
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
squire
had
been
as
quicksighted
as
he
was
remarkable
for
the
*NL*
contrary
,
passion
might
at
present
very
well
have
blinded
him
.
He
*NL*
thanked
Jones
for
offering
to
undertake
the
office
,
and
said
,
``
Go
,
go
,
*NL*
prithee
,
try
what
canst
do
;
''
and
then
swore
many
execrable
oaths
that
*NL*
he
would
turn
her
out
of
doors
unless
she
consented
to
the
match
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
meeting
between
Jones
and
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
departed
instantly
in
quest
of
Sophia
,
whom
he
found
just
risen
*NL*
from
the
ground
,
where
her
father
had
left
her
,
with
the
tears
*NL*
trickling
from
her
eyes
,
and
the
blood
running
from
her
lips
.
He
*NL*
presently
ran
to
her
,
and
with
a
voice
full
at
once
of
tenderness
and
*NL*
terrour
,
cried
,
``
O
my
Sophia
,
what
means
this
dreadful
sight
?
''
She
*NL*
looked
softly
at
him
for
a
moment
before
she
spoke
,
and
then
said
,
``
Mr
*NL*
Jones
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
how
came
you
here
?
--
Leave
me
,
I
beseech
you
,
*NL*
this
moment
.
''
--
``
Do
not
,
''
says
he
,
``
impose
so
harsh
a
command
upon
*NL*
me
--
my
heart
bleeds
faster
than
those
lips
.
O
Sophia
,
how
easily
could
*NL*
I
drain
my
veins
to
preserve
one
drop
of
that
dear
blood
.
''
--
``
I
have
*NL*
too
many
obligations
to
you
already
,
''
answered
she
,
``
for
sure
you
*NL*
meant
them
such
.
''
Here
she
looked
at
him
tenderly
almost
a
minute
,
and
*NL*
then
bursting
into
an
agony
,
cried
,
``
Oh
,
Mr
Jones
,
why
did
you
save
my
*NL*
life
?
my
death
would
have
been
happier
for
us
both
.
''
--
``
Happier
for
us
*NL*
both
!
''
cried
he
.
``
Could
racks
or
wheels
kill
me
so
painfully
as
*NL*
Sophia
's
--
I
can
not
bear
the
dreadful
sound
.
Do
I
live
but
for
her
?
''
*NL*
Both
his
voice
and
looks
were
full
of
inexpressible
tenderness
when
he
*NL*
spoke
these
words
;
and
at
the
same
time
he
laid
gently
hold
on
her
*NL*
hand
,
which
she
did
not
withdraw
from
him
;
to
say
the
truth
,
she
*NL*
hardly
knew
what
she
did
or
suffered
.
A
few
moments
now
passed
in
*NL*
silence
between
these
lovers
,
while
his
eyes
were
eagerly
fixed
on
*NL*
Sophia
,
and
hers
declining
towards
the
ground
:
at
last
she
recovered
*NL*
strength
enough
to
desire
him
again
to
leave
her
,
for
that
her
certain
*NL*
ruin
would
be
the
consequence
of
their
being
found
together
;
adding
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr
Jones
,
you
know
not
,
you
know
not
what
hath
passed
this
cruel
*NL*
afternoon
.
''
--
``
I
know
all
,
my
Sophia
,
''
answered
he
;
``
your
cruel
father
*NL*
hath
told
me
all
,
and
he
himself
hath
sent
me
hither
to
you
.
''
--
``
My
*NL*
father
sent
you
to
me
!
''
replied
she
:
``
sure
you
dream
.
''
--
``
Would
to
*NL*
Heaven
,
''
cries
he
,
``
it
was
but
a
dream
!
Oh
,
Sophia
,
your
father
hath
*NL*
sent
me
to
you
,
to
be
an
advocate
for
my
odious
rival
,
to
solicit
you
*NL*
in
his
favour
.
I
took
any
means
to
get
access
to
you
.
O
speak
to
me
,
*NL*
Sophia
!
comfort
my
bleeding
heart
.
Sure
no
one
ever
loved

ever
doated
*NL*
like
me

Do
not
unkindly
withhold
this
dear
,
this
soft
,
this
gentle
*NL*
hand
--
one
moment
,
perhaps
,
tears
you
for
ever
from
me
--
nothing
less
*NL*
than
this
cruel
occasion
could
,
I
believe
,
have
ever
conquered
the
*NL*
respect
and
awe
with
which
you
have
inspired
me
.
''
She
stood
a
moment
*NL*
silent
,
and
covered
with
confusion
;
then
lifting
up
her
eyes
gently
*NL*
towards
him
,
she
cried
,
``
What
would
Mr
Jones
have
me
say
?
''
--
``
O
do
but
*NL*
promise
,
''
cries
he
,
``
that
you
never
will
give
yourself
to
*NL*
Blifil
.
''
--
``
Name
not
,
''
answered
she
,
``
the
detested
sound
.
Be
assured
I
*NL*
never
will
give
him
what
is
in
my
power
to
withhold
from
him
.
''
--
``
Now
*NL*
then
,
''
cries
he
,
``
while
you
are
so
perfectly
kind
,
go
a
little
*NL*
farther
,
and
add
that
I
may
hope
.
''
--
``
Alas
!
''
says
she
,
``
Mr
Jones
,
*NL*
whither
will
you
drive
me
?
What
hope
have
I
to
bestow
?
You
know
my
*NL*
father
's
intentions
.
''
--
``
But
I
know
,
''
answered
he
,
``
your
compliance
*NL*
with
them
can
not
be
compelled
.
''
--
``
What
,
''
says
she
,
``
must
be
the
*NL*
dreadful
consequence
of
my
disobedience
?
My
own
ruin
is
my
least
*NL*
concern

I
can
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
being
the
cause
of
my
father
's
*NL*
misery
.
''
--
``
He
is
himself
the
cause
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
by
exacting
a
power
*NL*
over
you
which
Nature
hath
not
given
him
.
Think
on
the
misery
which
I
*NL*
am
to
suffer
if
I
am
to
lose
you
,
and
see
on
which
side
pity
will
turn
*NL*
the
balance
.
''
--
``
Think
of
it
!
''
replied
she
:
``
can
you
imagine
I
do
not
*NL*
feel
the
ruin
which
I
must
bring
on
you
,
should
I
comply
with
your
*NL*
desire
?
It
is
that
thought
which
gives
me
resolution
to
bid
you
fly
*NL*
from
me
for
ever
,
and
avoid
your
own
destruction
.
''
--
``
I
fear
no
*NL*
destruction

''
cries
he
,
``
but
the
loss
of
Sophia

If
you
would
save
me
*NL*
from
the
most
bitter
agonies

recall
that
cruel
sentence

Indeed

I
*NL*
can
never
part
with
you
,
indeed
I
can
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lovers
now
stood
both
silent
and
trembling
,
Sophia
being
unable
to
*NL*
withdraw
her
hand
from
Jones
,
and
he
almost
as
unable
to
hold
it
;
when
*NL*
the
scene
,
which
I
believe
some
of
my
readers
will
think
had
lasted
*NL*
long
enough
,
was
interrupted
by
one
of
so
different
a
nature
,
that
we
*NL*
shall
reserve
the
relation
of
it
for
a
different
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*

Being

Before
we
proceed
with
what
now
happened
to
our
lovers
,
it
may
be
*NL*
proper
to
recount
what
had
past
in
the
hall
during
their
tender
*NL*
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
Jones
had
left
Mr
Western
in
the
manner
above
mentioned
,
*NL*
his
sister
came
to
him
,
and
was
presently
informed
of
all
that
had
*NL*
passed
between
her
brother
and
Sophia
relating
to
Blifil
.

lady
construed
to
be
an
absolute
*NL*
breach
of
the
condition
on
which
she
had
engaged
to
keep
her
love
for
*NL*
Mr
Jones
a
secret
.
She
considered
herself
,
therefore
,
at
full
liberty
*NL*
to
reveal
all
she
knew
to
the
squire
,
which
she
immediately
did
in
the
*NL*
most
explicit
terms
,
and
without
any
ceremony
or
preface
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
a
marriage
between
Jones
and
his
daughter
,
had
never
once
*NL*
entered
into
the
squire
's
head
,
either
in
the
warmest
minutes
of
his
*NL*
affection
towards
that
young
man
,
or
from
suspicion
,
or
on
any
other
*NL*
occasion
.
He
did
indeed
consider
a
parity
of
fortune
and
circumstances
*NL*
to
be
physically
as
necessary
an
ingredient
in
marriage
,
as
difference
*NL*
of
sexes
,
or
any
other
essential
;
and
had
no
more
apprehension
of
his
*NL*
daughter
's
falling
in
love
with
a
poor
man
,
than
with
any
animal
of
a
*NL*
different
species
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
,
therefore
,
like
one
thunderstruck
at
his
sister
's
relation
.
*NL*
He
was
,
at
first
,
incapable
of
making
any
answer
,
having
been
almost
*NL*
deprived
of
his
breath
by
the
violence
of
the
surprize
.
This
,
however
,
*NL*
soon
returned
,
and
,
as
is
usual
in
other
cases
after
an
intermission
,
*NL*
with
redoubled
force
and
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
use
he
made
of
the
power
of
speech
,
after
his
recovery
from
*NL*
the
sudden
effects
of
his
astonishment
,
was
to
discharge
a
round
*NL*
volley
of
oaths
and
imprecations
.
After
which
he
proceeded
hastily
to
*NL*
the
apartment
where
he
expected
to
find
the
lovers
,
and
murmured
,
or
*NL*
rather
indeed
roared
forth
,
intentions
of
revenge
every
step
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
when
two
doves
,
or
two
wood-pigeons
,
or
as
when
Strephon
and
*NL*
Phyllis
-LRB-
for
that
comes
nearest
to
the
mark
-RRB-
are
retired
into
some
*NL*
pleasant
solitary
grove
,
to
enjoy
the
delightful
conversation
of
Love
,
*NL*
that
bashful
boy
,
who
can
not
speak
in
public
,
and
is
never
a
good
*NL*
companion
to
more
than
two
at
a
time
;
here
,
while
every
object
is
*NL*
serene
,
should
hoarse
thunder
burst
suddenly
through
the
shattered
*NL*
clouds
,
and
rumbling
roll
along
the
sky
,
the
frightened
maid
starts
*NL*
from
the
mossy
bank
or
verdant
turf
,
the
pale
livery
of
death
succeeds
*NL*
the
red
regimentals
in
which
Love
had
before
drest
her
cheeks
,
fear
*NL*
shakes
her
whole
frame
,
and
her
lover
scarce
supports
her
trembling
*NL*
tottering
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
as
when
two
gentlemen
,
strangers
to
the
wondrous
wit
of
the
place
,
*NL*
are
cracking
a
bottle
together
at
some
inn
or
tavern
at
Salisbury
,
if
*NL*
the
great
Dowdy
,
who
acts
the
part
of
a
madman
as
well
as
some
of
his
*NL*
setters-on
do
that
of
a
fool
,
should
rattle
his
chains
,
and
dreadfully
*NL*
hum
forth
the
grumbling
catch
along
the
gallery
;
the
frighted
*NL*
strangers
stand
aghast
;
scared
at
the
horrid
sound
,
they
seek
some
*NL*
place
of
shelter
from
the
approaching
danger
;
and
if
the
well-barred
*NL*
windows
did
admit
their
exit
,
would
venture
their
necks
to
escape
the
*NL*
threatening
fury
now
coming
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
trembled
poor
Sophia
,
so
turned
she
pale
at
the
noise
of
her
*NL*
father
,
who
,
in
a
voice
most
dreadful
to
hear
,
came
on
swearing
,
*NL*
cursing
,
and
vowing
the
destruction
of
Jones
.
To
say
the
truth
,
I
*NL*
believe
the
youth
himself
would
,
from
some
prudent
considerations
,
*NL*
have
preferred
another
place
of
abode
at
this
time
,
had
his
terror
on
*NL*
Sophia
's
account
given
him
liberty
to
reflect
a
moment
on
what
any
*NL*
otherways
concerned
himself
,
than
as
his
love
made
him
partake
*NL*
whatever
affected
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
squire
,
having
burst
open
the
door
,
beheld
an
object
which
*NL*
instantly
suspended
all
his
fury
against
Jones
;
this
was
the
ghastly
*NL*
appearance
of
Sophia
,
who
had
fainted
away
in
her
lover
's
arms
.
This
*NL*
tragical
sight
Mr
Western
no
sooner
beheld
,
than
all
his
rage
forsook
*NL*
him
;
he
roared
for
help
with
his
utmost
violence
;
ran
first
to
his
*NL*
daughter
,
then
back
to
the
door
calling
for
water
,
and
then
back
again
*NL*
to
Sophia
,
never
considering
in
whose
arms
she
then
was
,
nor
perhaps
*NL*
once
recollecting
that
there
was
such
a
person
in
the
world
as
Jones
;
*NL*
for
indeed
I
believe
the
present
circumstances
of
his
daughter
were
*NL*
now
the
sole
consideration
which
employed
his
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
and
a
great
number
of
servants
soon
came
to
the
assistance
*NL*
of
Sophia
with
water
,
cordials
,
and
everything
necessary
on
those
*NL*
occasions
.
These
were
applied
with
such
success
,
that
Sophia
in
a
very
*NL*
few
minutes
began
to
recover
,
and
all
the
symptoms
of
life
to
return
.
*NL*
Upon
which
she
was
presently
led
off
by
her
own
maid
and
Mrs
Western
:
*NL*
nor
did
that
good
lady
depart
without
leaving
some
wholesome
*NL*
admonitions
with
her
brother
,
on
the
dreadful
effects
of
his
passion
,
*NL*
or
,
as
she
pleased
to
call
it
,
madness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
,
perhaps
,
did
not
understand
this
good
advice
,
as
it
was
*NL*
delivered
in
obscure
hints
,
shrugs
,
and
notes
of
admiration
:
at
least
,
*NL*
if
he
did
understand
it
,
he
profited
very
little
by
it
;
for
no
sooner
*NL*
was
he
cured
of
his
immediate
fears
for
his
daughter
,
than
he
relapsed
*NL*
into
his
former
frenzy
,
which
must
have
produced
an
immediate
battle
*NL*
with
Jones
,
had
not
parson
Supple
,
who
was
a
very
strong
man
,
been
*NL*
present
,
and
by
mere
force
restrained
the
squire
from
acts
of
*NL*
hostility
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
Sophia
was
departed
,
Jones
advanced
in
a
very
suppliant
*NL*
manner
to
Mr
Western
,
whom
the
parson
held
in
his
arms
,
and
begged
him
*NL*
to
be
pacified
;
for
that
,
while
he
continued
in
such
a
passion
,
it
*NL*
would
be
impossible
to
give
him
any
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wull
have
satisfaction
o
'
thee
,
''
answered
the
squire
;
``
so
doff
thy
*NL*
clothes
.
_
At
unt
_
half
a
man
,
and
I
'll
lick
thee
as
well
as
wast
ever
*NL*
licked
in
thy
life
.
''
He
then
bespattered
the
youth
with
abundance
of
*NL*
that
language
which
passes
between
country
gentlemen
who
embrace
*NL*
opposite
sides
of
the
question
;
with
frequent
applications
to
him
to
*NL*
salute
that
part
which
is
generally
introduced
into
all
controversies
*NL*
that
arise
among
the
lower
orders
of
the
English
gentry
at
*NL*
horse-races
,
cock-matches
,
and
other
public
places
.
Allusions
to
this
*NL*
part
are
likewise
often
made
for
the
sake
of
the
jest
.
And
here
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
the
wit
is
generally
misunderstood
.
In
reality
,
it
lies
in
*NL*
desiring
another
to
kiss
your
a
--
for
having
just
before
threatened
to
*NL*
kick
his
;
for
I
have
observed
very
accurately
,
that
no
one
ever
*NL*
desires
you
to
kick
that
which
belongs
to
himself
,
nor
offers
to
kiss
*NL*
this
part
in
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
likewise
seem
surprizing
that
in
the
many
thousand
kind
*NL*
invitations
of
this
sort
,
which
every
one
who
hath
conversed
with
*NL*
country
gentlemen
must
have
heard
,
no
one
,
I
believe
,
hath
ever
seen
a
*NL*
single
instance
where
the
desire
hath
been
complied
with
;
--
a
great
*NL*
instance
of
their
want
of
politeness
;
for
in
town
nothing
can
be
more
*NL*
common
than
for
the
finest
gentlemen
to
perform
this
ceremony
every
*NL*
day
to
their
superiors
,
without
having
that
favour
once
requested
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
such
wit
,
Jones
very
calmly
answered
,
``
Sir
,
this
usage
may
*NL*
perhaps
cancel
every
other
obligation
you
have
conferred
on
me
;
but
*NL*
there
is
one
you
can
never
cancel
;
nor
will
I
be
provoked
by
your
*NL*
abuse
to
lift
my
hand
against
the
father
of
Sophia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
the
squire
grew
still
more
outrageous
than
before
;
so
*NL*
that
the
parson
begged
Jones
to
retire
;
saying
,
``
You
behold
,
sir
,
how
*NL*
he
waxeth
wrath
at
your
abode
here
;
therefore
let
me
pray
you
not
to
*NL*
tarry
any
longer
.
His
anger
is
too
much
kindled
for
you
to
commune
*NL*
with
him
at
present
.
You
had
better
,
therefore
,
conclude
your
visit
,
*NL*
and
refer
what
matters
you
have
to
urge
in
your
behalf
to
some
other
*NL*
opportunity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
accepted
this
advice
with
thanks
,
and
immediately
departed
.
The
*NL*
squire
now
regained
the
liberty
of
his
hands
,
and
so
much
temper
as
to
*NL*
express
some
satisfaction
in
the
restraint
which
had
been
laid
upon
*NL*
him
;
declaring
that
he
should
certainly
have
beat
his
brains
out
;
and
*NL*
adding
,
``
It
would
have
vexed
one
confoundedly
to
have
been
hanged
for
*NL*
such
a
rascal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
parson
now
began
to
triumph
in
the
success
of
his
peace-making
*NL*
endeavours
,
and
proceeded
to
read
a
lecture
against
anger
,
which
might
*NL*
perhaps
rather
have
tended
to
raise
than
to
quiet
that
passion
in
some
*NL*
hasty
minds
.
This
lecture
he
enriched
with
many
valuable
quotations
*NL*
from
the
antients
,
particularly
from
Seneca
;
who
hath
indeed
so
well
*NL*
handled
this
passion
,
that
none
but
a
very
angry
man
can
read
him
*NL*
without
great
pleasure
and
profit
.
The
doctor
concluded
this
harangue
*NL*
with
the
famous
story
of
Alexander
and
Clitus
;
but
as
I
find
that
*NL*
entered
in
my
common-place
under
title
Drunkenness
,
I
shall
not
insert
*NL*
it
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
took
no
notice
of
this
story
,
nor
perhaps
of
anything
he
*NL*
said
;
for
he
interrupted
him
before
he
had
finished
,
by
calling
for
a
*NL*
tankard
of
beer
;
observing
-LRB-
which
is
perhaps
as
true
as
any
*NL*
observation
on
this
fever
of
the
mind
-RRB-
that
anger
makes
a
man
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
had
the
squire
swallowed
a
large
draught
than
he
renewed
the
*NL*
discourse
on
Jones
,
and
declared
a
resolution
of
going
the
next
*NL*
morning
early
to
acquaint
Mr
Allworthy
.
His
friend
would
have
*NL*
dissuaded
him
from
this
,
from
the
mere
motive
of
good-nature
;
but
his
*NL*
dissuasion
had
no
other
effect
than
to
produce
a
large
volley
of
oaths
*NL*
and
curses
,
which
greatly
shocked
the
pious
ears
of
Supple
;
but
he
did
*NL*
not
dare
to
remonstrate
against
a
privilege
which
the
squire
claimed
*NL*
as
a
freeborn
Englishman
.
To
say
truth
,
the
parson
submitted
to
please
*NL*
his
palate
at
the
squire
's
table
,
at
the
expense
of
suffering
now
and
*NL*
then
this
violence
to
his
ears
.
He
contented
himself
with
thinking
he
*NL*
did
not
promote
this
evil
practice
,
and
that
the
squire
would
not
*NL*
swear
an
oath
the
less
,
if
he
never
entered
within
his
gates
.
However
,
*NL*
though
he
was
not
guilty
of
ill
manners
by
rebuking
a
gentleman
in
his
*NL*
own
house
,
he
paid
him
off
obliquely
in
the
pulpit
:
which
had
not
,
*NL*
indeed
,
the
good
effect
of
working
a
reformation
in
the
squire
*NL*
himself
;
yet
it
so
far
operated
on
his
conscience
,
that
he
put
the
*NL*
laws
very
severely
in
execution
against
others
,
and
the
magistrate
was
*NL*
the
only
person
in
the
parish
who
could
swear
with
impunity
.

In
which
Mr
Western
visits
Mr
Allworthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
was
now
retired
from
breakfast
with
his
nephew
,
well
*NL*
satisfied
with
the
report
of
the
young
gentleman
's
successful
visit
to
*NL*
Sophia
-LRB-
for
he
greatly
desired
the
match
,
more
on
account
of
the
young
*NL*
lady
's
character
than
of
her
riches
-RRB-
,
when
Mr
Western
broke
abruptly
*NL*
in
upon
them
,
and
without
any
ceremony
began
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
have
done
a
fine
piece
of
work
truly
!
You
have
brought
up
*NL*
your
bastard
to
a
fine
purpose
;
not
that
I
believe
you
have
had
any
*NL*
hand
in
it
neither
,
that
is
,
as
a
man
may
say
,
designedly
:
but
there
*NL*
is
a
fine
kettle-of-fish
made
o
n't
up
at
our
house
.
''
``
What
can
be
the
*NL*
matter
,
Mr
Western
?
''
said
Allworthy
.
``
O
,
matter
enow
of
all
*NL*
conscience
:
my
daughter
hath
fallen
in
love
with
your
bastard

's
*NL*
all
;
but
I
wo
n't
ge
her
a

not
the

part
of

brass
*NL*
varden

I
always
thought
what
would
come
o

breeding
up
a
bastard
like
*NL*
a
gentleman

and
letting

come
about

''
``
I
am
heartily
sorry

''
cries
*NL*
Allworthy
.
``
Pox

''
says
Western
;
``

The
son
of
a
bitch
was
always
good
at
finding

hare

sitting

be
rotted

I
little
thought

he
was
looking

it

be
the
worst
he
ever

''
``
I
am
in
amazement
,
''
cries
Allworthy
,
``
at
what
you
*NL*
tell
me
,
after
what
passed
between
my
nephew
and
the
young
lady
no
*NL*
longer
ago
than
yesterday
.
''
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
answered
Western
,
``
it
was
*NL*
after
what
passed
between
your
nephew
and
she
that
the
whole
matter
*NL*
came
out
.
Mr
Blifil
there
was
no
sooner
gone
than
the
son
of
a
whore
*NL*
came
lurching
about
the
house
.
Little
did
I
think
when
I
used
to
love
*NL*
him
for
a
sportsman
that
he
was
all
the
while
a
poaching
after
my
*NL*
daughter
.
''
``
Why
truly
,
''
says
Allworthy
,
``
I
could
wish
you
had
not
*NL*
given
him
so
many
opportunities
with
her
;
and
you
will
do
me
the
*NL*
justice
to
acknowledge
that
I
have
always
been
averse
to
his
staying
*NL*
so
much
at
your
house
,
though
I
own
I
had
no
suspicion
of
this
kind
.
''
*NL*
``
Why
,
zounds
,
''
cries
Western
,
``
who
could
have
thought
it
?
What
the
*NL*
devil
had
she
to
do
wi
`
n
?
He
did
not
come
there
a
courting
to
her
;
he
*NL*
came
there
a
hunting
with
me
.
''
``
But
was
it
possible
,
''
says
Allworthy
,
*NL*
``
that
you
should
never
discern
any
symptoms
of
love
between
them
,
when
*NL*
you
have
seen
them
so
often
together
?
''
``
Never
in
my
life
,
as
I
hope
to
*NL*
be
saved
,
''
cries
Western
:
``
I
never
so
much
as
zeed
him
kiss
her
in
all
*NL*
my
life
;
and
so
far
from
courting
her
,
he
used
rather
to
be
more
*NL*
silent
when
she
was
in
company
than
at
any
other
time
;
and
as
for
the
*NL*
girl
,
she
was
always
less
civil
to
'n
than
to
any
young
man
that
came
*NL*
to
the
house
.
As
to
that
matter
,
I
am
not
more
easy
to
be
deceived
*NL*
than
another
;
I
would
not
have
you
think
I
am
,
neighbour
.
''
Allworthy
*NL*
could
scarce
refrain
laughter
at
this
;
but
he
resolved
to
do
a
*NL*
violence
to
himself
;
for
he
perfectly
well
knew
mankind
,
and
had
too
*NL*
much
good-breeding
and
good-nature
to
offend
the
squire
in
his
present
*NL*
circumstances
.
He
then
asked
Western
what
he
would
have
him
do
upon
*NL*
this
occasion
.
To
which
the
other
answered
,
``
That
he
would
have
him
*NL*
keep
the
rascal
away
from
his
house
,
and
that
he
would
go
and
lock
up
*NL*
the
wench
;
for
he
was
resolved
to
make
her
marry
Mr
Blifil
in
spite
of
*NL*
her
teeth
.
''
He
then
shook
Blifil
by
the
hand
,
and
swore
he
would
have
*NL*
no
other
son-in-law
.
Presently
after
which
he
took
his
leave
;
saying
*NL*
his
house
was
in
such
disorder
that
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
make
*NL*
haste
home
,
to
take
care
his
daughter
did
not
give
him
the
slip
;
and
*NL*
as
for
Jones
,
he
swore
if
he
caught
him
at
his
house
,
he
would
qualify
*NL*
him
to
run
for
the
geldings
'
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Allworthy
and
Blifil
were
again
left
together
,
a
long
silence
*NL*
ensued
between
them
;
all
which
interval
the
young
gentleman
filled
up
*NL*
with
sighs
,
which
proceeded
partly
from
disappointment
,
but
more
from
*NL*
hatred
;
for
the
success
of
Jones
was
much
more
grievous
to
him
than
*NL*
the
loss
of
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
his
uncle
asked
him
what
he
was
determined
to
do
,
and
he
*NL*
answered
in
the
following
words
:
--
``
Alas
!
sir
,
can
it
be
a
question
*NL*
what
step
a
lover
will
take
,
when
reason
and
passion
point
different
*NL*
ways
?
I
am
afraid
it
is
too
certain
he
will
,
in
that
dilemma
,
always
*NL*
follow
the
latter
.
Reason
dictates
to
me
,
to
quit
all
thoughts
of
a
*NL*
woman
who
places
her
affections
on
another
;
my
passion
bids
me
hope
*NL*
she
may
in
time
change
her
inclinations
in
my
favour
.
Here
,
however
,
I
*NL*
conceive
an
objection
may
be
raised
,
which
,
if
it
could
not
fully
be
*NL*
answered
,
would
totally
deter
me
from
any
further
pursuit
.
I
mean
the
*NL*
injustice
of
endeavouring
to
supplant
another
in
a
heart
of
which
he
*NL*
seems
already
in
possession
;
but
the
determined
resolution
of
Mr
*NL*
Western
shows
that
,
in
this
case
,
I
shall
,
by
so
doing
,
promote
the
*NL*
happiness
of
every
party
;
not
only
that
of
the
parent
,
who
will
thus
*NL*
be
preserved
from
the
highest
degree
of
misery
,
but
of
both
the
*NL*
others
,
who
must
be
undone
by
this
match
.
The
lady
,
I
am
sure
,
will
be
*NL*
undone
in
every
sense
;
for
,
besides
the
loss
of
most
part
of
her
own
*NL*
fortune
,
she
will
be
not
only
married
to
a
beggar
,
but
the
little
*NL*
fortune
which
her
father
can
not
withhold
from
her
will
be
squandered
*NL*
on
that
wench
with
whom
I
know
he
yet
converses
.
Nay
,
that
is
a
*NL*
trifle
;
for
I
know
him
to
be
one
of
the
worst
men
in
the
world
;
for
*NL*
had
my
dear
uncle
known
what
I
have
hitherto
endeavoured
to
conceal
,
*NL*
he
must
have
long
since
abandoned
so
profligate
a
wretch
.
''
``
How
!
''
said
*NL*
Allworthy
;
``
hath
he
done
anything
worse
than
I
already
know
?
Tell
me
,
*NL*
I
beseech
you
?
''
``
No
,
''
replied
Blifil
;
``
it
is
now
past
,
and
perhaps
he
*NL*
may
have
repented
of
it
.
''
``
I
command
you
,
on
your
duty
,
''
said
*NL*
Allworthy
,
``
to
tell
me
what
you
mean
.
''
``
You
know
,
sir
,
''
says
Blifil
,
*NL*
``
I
never
disobeyed
you
;
but
I
am
sorry
I
mentioned
it
,
since
it
may
*NL*
now
look
like
revenge
,
whereas
,
I
thank
Heaven
,
no
such
motive
ever
*NL*
entered
my
heart
;
and
if
you
oblige
me
to
discover
it
,
I
must
be
his
*NL*
petitioner
to
you
for
your
forgiveness
.
''
``
I
will
have
no
conditions
,
''
*NL*
answered
Allworthy
;
``
I
think
I
have
shown
tenderness
enough
towards
*NL*
him
,
and
more
perhaps
than
you
ought
to
thank
me
for
.
''
``
More
,
indeed
,
*NL*
I
fear
,
than
he
deserved
,
''
cries
Blifil
;
``
for
in
the
very
day
of
your
*NL*
utmost
danger
,
when
myself
and
all
the
family
were
in
tears
,
he
filled
*NL*
the
house
with
riot
and
debauchery
.
He
drank
,
and
sung
,
and
roared
;
*NL*
and
when
I
gave
him
a
gentle
hint
of
the
indecency
of
his
actions
,
he
*NL*
fell
into
a
violent
passion
,
swore
many
oaths
,
called
me
rascal
,
and
*NL*
struck
me
.
''
``
How
!
''
cries
Allworthy
;
``
did
he
dare
to
strike
you
?
''
``
I
am
*NL*
sure
,
''
cries
Blifil
,
``
I
have
forgiven
him
that
long
ago
.
I
wish
I
*NL*
could
so
easily
forget
his
ingratitude
to
the
best
of
benefactors
;
and
*NL*
yet
even
that
I
hope
you
will
forgive
him
,
since
he
must
have
*NL*
certainly
been
possessed
with
the
devil
:
for
that
very
evening
,
as
Mr
*NL*
Thwackum
and
myself
were
taking
the
air
in
the
fields
,
and
exulting
in
*NL*
the
good
symptoms
which
then
first
began
to
discover
themselves
,
we
*NL*
unluckily
saw
him
engaged
with
a
wench
in
a
manner
not
fit
to
be
*NL*
mentioned
.
Mr
Thwackum
,
with
more
boldness
than
prudence
,
advanced
to
*NL*
rebuke
him
,
when
-LRB-
I
am
sorry
to
say
it
-RRB-
he
fell
upon
the
worthy
man
,
*NL*
and
beat
him
so
outrageously
that
I
wish
he
may
have
yet
recovered
the
*NL*
bruises
.
Nor
was
I
without
my
share
of
the
effects
of
his
malice
,
*NL*
while
I
endeavoured
to
protect
my
tutor
;
but
that
I
have
long
*NL*
forgiven
;
nay
,
I
prevailed
with
Mr
Thwackum
to
forgive
him
too
,
and
*NL*
not
to
inform
you
of
a
secret
which
I
feared
might
be
fatal
to
him
.
*NL*
And
now
,
sir
,
since
I
have
unadvisedly
dropped
a
hint
of
this
matter
,
*NL*
and
your
commands
have
obliged
me
to
discover
the
whole
,
let
me
*NL*
intercede
with
you
for
him
.
''
``
O
child
!
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
I
know
not
*NL*
whether
I
should
blame
or
applaud
your
goodness
,
in
concealing
such
*NL*
villany
a
moment
:
but
where
is
Mr
Thwackum
?
Not
that
I
want
any
*NL*
confirmation
of
what
you
say
;
but
I
will
examine
all
the
evidence
of
*NL*
this
matter
,
to
justify
to
the
world
the
example
I
am
resolved
to
make
*NL*
of
such
a
monster
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thwackum
was
now
sent
for
,
and
presently
appeared
.
He
corroborated
*NL*
every
circumstance
which
the
other
had
deposed
;
nay
,
he
produced
the
*NL*
record
upon
his
breast
,
where
the
handwriting
of
Mr
Jones
remained
*NL*
very
legible
in
black
and
blue
.
He
concluded
with
declaring
to
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
that
he
should
have
long
since
informed
him
of
this
matter
,
*NL*
had
not
Mr
Blifil
,
by
the
most
earnest
interpositions
,
prevented
him
.
*NL*
``
He
is
,
''
says
he
,
``
an
excellent
youth
:
though
such
forgiveness
of
*NL*
enemies
is
carrying
the
matter
too
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
reality
,
Blifil
had
taken
some
pains
to
prevail
with
the
parson
,
*NL*
and
to
prevent
the
discovery
at
that
time
;
for
which
he
had
many
*NL*
reasons
.
He
knew
that
the
minds
of
men
are
apt
to
be
softened
and
*NL*
relaxed
from
their
usual
severity
by
sickness
.
Besides
,
he
imagined
*NL*
that
if
the
story
was
told
when
the
fact
was
so
recent
,
and
the
*NL*
physician
about
the
house
,
who
might
have
unravelled
the
real
truth
,
*NL*
he
should
never
be
able
to
give
it
the
malicious
turn
which
he
*NL*
intended
.
Again
,
he
resolved
to
hoard
up
this
business
,
till
the
*NL*
indiscretion
of
Jones
should
afford
some
additional
complaints
;
for
he
*NL*
thought
the
joint
weight
of
many
facts
falling
upon
him
together
,
*NL*
would
be
the
most
likely
to
crush
him
;
and
he
watched
,
therefore
,
some
*NL*
such
opportunity
as
that
with
which
fortune
had
now
kindly
presented
*NL*
him
.
Lastly
,
by
prevailing
with
Thwackum
to
conceal
the
matter
for
a
*NL*
time
,
he
knew
he
should
confirm
an
opinion
of
his
friendship
to
Jones
,
*NL*
which
he
had
greatly
laboured
to
establish
in
Mr
Allworthy
.

Chapter
xi
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
chapter
;
but
which
contains
sufficient
matter
to
affect
the
*NL*
good-natured
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Mr
Allworthy
's
custom
never
to
punish
any
one
,
not
even
to
turn
*NL*
away
a
servant
,
in
a
passion
.
He
resolved
therefore
to
delay
passing
*NL*
sentence
on
Jones
till
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
young
man
attended
at
dinner
,
as
usual
;
but
his
heart
was
too
*NL*
much
loaded
to
suffer
him
to
eat
.
His
grief
too
was
a
good
deal
*NL*
aggravated
by
the
unkind
looks
of
Mr
Allworthy
;
whence
he
concluded
*NL*
that
Western
had
discovered
the
whole
affair
between
him
and
Sophia
;
*NL*
but
as
to
Mr
Blifil
's
story
,
he
had
not
the
least
apprehension
;
for
of
*NL*
much
the
greater
part
he
was
entirely
innocent
;
and
for
the
residue
,
*NL*
as
he
had
forgiven
and
forgotten
it
himself
,
so
he
suspected
no
*NL*
remembrance
on
the
other
side
.
When
dinner
was
over
,
and
the
servants
*NL*
departed
,
Mr
Allworthy
began
to
harangue
.
He
set
forth
,
in
a
long
*NL*
speech
,
the
many
iniquities
of
which
Jones
had
been
guilty
,
*NL*
particularly
those
which
this
day
had
brought
to
light
;
and
concluded
*NL*
by
telling
him
,
``
That
unless
he
could
clear
himself
of
the
charge
,
he
*NL*
was
resolved
to
banish
him
his
sight
for
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Many
disadvantages
attended
poor
Jones
in
making
his
defence
;
nay
,
*NL*
indeed
,
he
hardly
knew
his
accusation
;
for
as
Mr
Allworthy
,
in
*NL*
recounting
the
drunkenness
,
&
c.
,
while
he
lay
ill
,
out
of
modesty
sunk
*NL*
everything
that
related
particularly
to
himself
,
which
indeed
*NL*
principally
constituted
the
crime
;
Jones
could
not
deny
the
charge
.
*NL*
His
heart
was
,
besides
,
almost
broken
already
;
and
his
spirits
were
so
*NL*
sunk
,
that
he
could
say
nothing
for
himself
;
but
acknowledged
the
*NL*
whole
,
and
,
like
a
criminal
in
despair
,
threw
himself
upon
mercy
;
*NL*
concluding
,
``
That
though
he
must
own
himself
guilty
of
many
follies
*NL*
and
inadvertencies
,
he
hoped
he
had
done
nothing
to
deserve
what
would
*NL*
be
to
him
the
greatest
punishment
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
answered
,
``
That
he
had
forgiven
him
too
often
already
,
in
*NL*
compassion
to
his
youth
,
and
in
hopes
of
his
amendment
:
that
he
now
*NL*
found
he
was
an
abandoned
reprobate
,
and
such
as
it
would
be
criminal
*NL*
in
any
one
to
support
and
encourage
.
Nay
,
''
said
Mr
Allworthy
to
him
,
*NL*
``
your
audacious
attempt
to
steal
away
the
young
lady

calls
upon
me
to
*NL*
justify
my
own
character
in
punishing
you
.
The
world
who
have
already
*NL*
censured
the
regard
I
have
shown
for
you
may
think
,
with
some
colour
*NL*
at
least
of
justice
,
that
I
connive
at
so
base
and
barbarous
an

action
--
an
action
of
which
you
must
have
known
my
abhorrence
:
and
*NL*
which
,
had
you
had
any
concern
for
my
ease
and
honour
,
as
well
as
for
*NL*
my
friendship
,
you
would
never
have
thought
of
undertaking
.
Fie
upon
*NL*
it
,
young
man
!
indeed
there
is
scarce
any
punishment
equal
to
your
*NL*
crimes
,
and
I
can
scarce
think
myself
justifiable
in
what
I
am
now
*NL*
going
to
bestow
on
you
.
However
,
as
I
have
educated
you
like
a
child
*NL*
of
my
own
,
I
will
not
turn
you
naked
into
the
world
.
When
you
open
*NL*
this
paper
,
therefore
,
you
will
find
something
which
may
enable
you
,
*NL*
with
industry
,
to
get
an
honest
livelihood
;
but
if
you
employ
it
to
*NL*
worse
purposes
,
I
shall
not
think
myself
obliged
to
supply
you
*NL*
farther
,
being
resolved
,
from
this
day
forward
,
to
converse
no
more
*NL*
with
you
on
any
account
.
I
can
not
avoid
saying
,
there
is
no
part
of
*NL*
your
conduct
which
I
resent
more
than
your
ill-treatment
of
that
good
*NL*
young
man
-LRB-
meaning
Blifil
-RRB-
who
hath
behaved
with
so
much
tenderness
*NL*
and
honour
towards
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
last
words
were
a
dose
almost
too
bitter
to
be
swallowed
.
A
*NL*
flood
of
tears
now
gushed
from
the
eyes
of
Jones
,
and
every
faculty
of
*NL*
speech
and
motion
seemed
to
have
deserted
him
.
It
was
some
time
before
*NL*
he
was
able
to
obey
Allworthy
's
peremptory
commands
of
departing
;
*NL*
which
he
at
length
did
,
having
first
kissed
his
hands
with
a
passion
*NL*
difficult
to
be
affected
,
and
as
difficult
to
be
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
must
be
very
weak
,
if
,
when
he
considers
the
light
in
which
*NL*
Jones
then
appeared
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
he
should
blame
the
rigour
of
his
*NL*
sentence
.
And
yet
all
the
neighbourhood
,
either
from
this
weakness
,
or
*NL*
from
some
worse
motive
,
condemned
this
justice
and
severity
as
the
*NL*
highest
cruelty
.
Nay
,
the
very
persons
who
had
before
censured
the
*NL*
good
man
for
the
kindness
and
tenderness
shown
to
a
bastard
-LRB-
his
own
,
*NL*
according
to
the
general
opinion
-RRB-
,
now
cried
out
as
loudly
against
*NL*
turning
his
own
child
out
of
doors
.
The
women
especially
were
*NL*
unanimous
in
taking
the
part
of
Jones
,
and
raised
more
stories
on
the
*NL*
occasion
than
I
have
room
,
in
this
chapter
,
to
set
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
must
not
be
omitted
,
that
,
in
their
censures
on
this
*NL*
occasion
,
none
ever
mentioned
the
sum
contained
in
the
paper
which
*NL*
Allworthy
gave
Jones
,
which
was
no
less
than
five
hundred
pounds
;
but
*NL*
all
agreed
that
he
was
sent
away
penniless
,
and
some
said
naked
,
from
*NL*
the
house
of
his
inhuman
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
xii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
love-letters
,
&
c.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
commanded
to
leave
the
house
immediately
,
and
told
,
that
his
*NL*
clothes
and
everything
else
should
be
sent
to
him
whithersoever
he
*NL*
should
order
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
accordingly
set
out
,
and
walked
above
a
mile
,
not
regarding
,
and
*NL*
indeed
scarce
knowing
,
whither
he
went
.
At
length
a
little
brook
*NL*
obstructing
his
passage
,
he
threw
himself
down
by
the
side
of
it
;
nor
*NL*
could
he
help
muttering
with
some
little
indignation
,
``
Sure
my
father
*NL*
will
not
deny
me
this
place
to
rest
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
presently
fell
into
the
most
violent
agonies
,
tearing
his
hair
*NL*
from
his
head
,
and
using
most
other
actions
which
generally
accompany
*NL*
fits
of
madness
,
rage
,
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
in
this
manner
vented
the
first
emotions
of
passion
,
he
*NL*
began
to
come
a
little
to
himself
.
His
grief
now
took
another
turn
,
*NL*
and
discharged
itself
in
a
gentler
way
,
till
he
became
at
last
cool
*NL*
enough
to
reason
with
his
passion
,
and
to
consider
what
steps
were
*NL*
proper
to
be
taken
in
his
deplorable
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
great
doubt
was
,
how
to
act
with
regard
to
Sophia
.
The
*NL*
thoughts
of
leaving
her
almost
rent
his
heart
asunder
;
but
the
*NL*
consideration
of
reducing
her
to
ruin
and
beggary
still
racked
him
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
more
;
and
if
the
violent
desire
of
possessing
her
person
*NL*
could
have
induced
him
to
listen
one
moment
to
this
alternative
,
still
*NL*
he
was
by
no
means
certain
of
her
resolution
to
indulge
his
wishes
at
*NL*
so
high
an
expense
.
The
resentment
of
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
the
injury
he
*NL*
must
do
to
his
quiet
,
argued
strongly
against
this
latter
;
and
lastly
,
*NL*
the
apparent
impossibility
of
his
success
,
even
if
he
would
sacrifice
*NL*
all
these
considerations
to
it
,
came
to
his
assistance
;
and
thus
*NL*
honour
at
last
backed
with
despair
,
with
gratitude
to
his
benefactor
,
*NL*
and
with
real
love
to
his
mistress
,
got
the
better
of
burning
desire
,
*NL*
and
he
resolved
rather
to
quit
Sophia
,
than
pursue
her
to
her
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
difficult
for
any
who
have
not
felt
it
,
to
conceive
the
glowing
*NL*
warmth
which
filled
his
breast
on
the
first
contemplation
of
this
*NL*
victory
over
his
passion
.
Pride
flattered
him
so
agreeably
,
that
his
*NL*
mind
perhaps
enjoyed
perfect
happiness
;
but
this
was
only
momentary
:
*NL*
Sophia
soon
returned
to
his
imagination
,
and
allayed
the
joy
of
his
*NL*
triumph
with
no
less
bitter
pangs
than
a
good-natured
general
must
*NL*
feel
,
when
he
surveys
the
bleeding
heaps
,
at
the
price
of
whose
blood
*NL*
he
hath
purchased
his
laurels
;
for
thousands
of
tender
ideas
lay
*NL*
murdered
before
our
conqueror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
resolved
,
however
,
to
pursue
the
paths
of
this
giant
honour
,
as
*NL*
the
gigantic
poet
Lee
calls
it
,
he
determined
to
write
a
farewel
*NL*
letter
to
Sophia
;
and
accordingly
proceeded
to
a
house
not
far
off
,
*NL*
where
,
being
furnished
with
proper
materials
,
he
wrote
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
MADAM
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
reflect
on
the
situation
in
which
I
write
,
I
am
sure
your
*NL*
good-nature
will
pardon
any
inconsistency
or
absurdity
which
my
*NL*
letter
contains
;
for
everything
here
flows
from
a
heart
so
full
,
*NL*
that
no
language
can
express
its
dictates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
resolved
,
madam
,
to
obey
your
commands
,
in
flying
for
ever
*NL*
from
your
dear
,
your
lovely
sight
.
Cruel
indeed
those
commands
are
;
*NL*
but
it
is
a
cruelty
which
proceeds
from
fortune
,
not
from
my
Sophia
.
*NL*
Fortune
hath
made
it
necessary
,
necessary
to
your
preservation
,
to
*NL*
forget
there
ever
was
such
a
wretch
as
I
am

*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
I
would
not
hint
all
my
sufferings
to
you
,
if
I
*NL*
imagined
they
could
possibly
escape
your
ears
.
I
know
the
goodness
*NL*
and
tenderness
of
your
heart
,
and
would
avoid
giving
you
any
of
*NL*
those
pains
which
you
always
feel
for
the
miserable

O
let
nothing

*NL*
which
you
shall
hear

my
hard
fortune

cause
a
moment

the
loss
of
you

everything

to
me
a
trifle

*NL*
``
O
Sophia
!
it
is
hard
to
leave
you

it
is
harder
still
to
desire
you
*NL*
to
forget
me
;
yet
the
sincerest
love
obliges
me
to
both
.
Pardon
my
*NL*
conceiving
that
any
remembrance

can
give
you
disquiet

so
gloriously
wretched

your
relief

I
never

truly

can
never
be
too
*NL*
severely
punished

protect

He
was
now
searching
his
pockets
for
his
wax
,
but
found
none
,
nor
*NL*
indeed
anything
else
,
therein
;
for
in
truth
he
had
,
in
his
frantic
*NL*
disposition
,
tossed
everything
from
him
,
and
amongst
the
rest
,
his
*NL*
pocket-book
,
which
he
had
received
from
Mr
Allworthy
,
which
he
had
*NL*
never
opened
,
and
which
now
first
occurred
to
his
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
supplied
him
with
a
wafer
for
his
present
purpose
,
with
*NL*
which
,
having
sealed
his
letter
,
he
returned
hastily
towards
the
brook
*NL*
side
,
in
order
to
search
for
the
things
which
he
had
there
lost
.
In
*NL*
his
way
he
met
his
old
friend
Black
George
,
who
heartily
condoled
with
*NL*
him
on
his
misfortune
;
for
this
had
already
reached
his
ears
,
and
*NL*
indeed
those
of
all
the
neighbourhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
acquainted
the
gamekeeper
with
his
loss
,
and
he
as
readily
went
*NL*
back
with
him
to
the
brook
,
where
they
searched
every
tuft
of
grass
in
*NL*
the
meadow
,
as
well
where
Jones
had
not
been
as
where
he
had
been
;
but
*NL*
all
to
no
purpose
,
for
they
found
nothing
;
for
,
indeed
,
though
the
*NL*
things
were
then
in
the
meadow
,
they
omitted
to
search
the
only
place
*NL*
where
they
were
deposited
;
to
wit
,
in
the
pockets
of
the
said
George
;
*NL*
for
he
had
just
before
found
them
,
and
being
luckily
apprized
of
their
*NL*
value
,
had
very
carefully
put
them
up
for
his
own
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamekeeper
having
exerted
as
much
diligence
in
quest
of
the
lost
*NL*
goods
,
as
if
he
had
hoped
to
find
them
,
desired
Mr
Jones
to
recollect
*NL*
if
he
had
been
in
no
other
place
:
``
For
sure
,
''
said
he
,
``
if
you
had
*NL*
lost
them
here
so
lately
,
the
things
must
have
been
here
still
;
for
*NL*
this
is
a
very
unlikely
place
for
any
one
to
pass
by
.
''
And
indeed
it
*NL*
was
by
great
accident
that
he
himself
had
passed
through
that
field
,
*NL*
in
order
to
lay
wires
for
hares
,
with
which
he
was
to
supply
a
*NL*
poulterer
at
Bath
the
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
now
gave
over
all
hopes
of
recovering
his
loss
,
and
almost
all
*NL*
thoughts
concerning
it
,
and
turning
to
Black
George
,
asked
him
*NL*
earnestly
if
he
would
do
him
the
greatest
favour
in
the
world
?
*NL*
*NL*
George
answered
with
some
hesitation
,
``
Sir
,
you
know
you
may
command
*NL*
me
whatever
is
in
my
power
,
and
I
heartily
wish
it
was
in
my
power
to
*NL*
do
you
any
service
.
''
In
fact
,
the
question
staggered
him
;
for
he
had
,
*NL*
by
selling
game
,
amassed
a
pretty
good
sum
of
money
in
Mr
Western
's
*NL*
service
,
and
was
afraid
that
Jones
wanted
to
borrow
some
small
matter
*NL*
of
him
;
but
he
was
presently
relieved
from
his
anxiety
,
by
being
*NL*
desired
to
convey
a
letter
to
Sophia
,
which
with
great
pleasure
he
*NL*
promised
to
do
.
And
indeed
I
believe
there
are
few
favours
which
he
*NL*
would
not
have
gladly
conferred
on
Mr
Jones
;
for
he
bore
as
much
*NL*
gratitude
towards
him
as
he
could
,
and
was
as
honest
as
men
who
love
*NL*
money
better
than
any
other
thing
in
the
universe
,
generally
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
was
agreed
by
both
to
be
the
proper
means
by
which
this
*NL*
letter
should
pass
to
Sophia
.
They
then
separated
;
the
gamekeeper
*NL*
returned
home
to
Mr
Western
's
,
and
Jones
walked
to
an
alehouse
at
half
*NL*
a
mile
's
distance
,
to
wait
for
his
messenger
's
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
no
sooner
came
home
to
his
master
's
house
than
he
met
with
Mrs
*NL*
Honour
;
to
whom
,
having
first
sounded
her
with
a
few
previous
*NL*
questions
,
he
delivered
the
letter
for
her
mistress
,
and
received
at
*NL*
the
same
time
another
from
her
,
for
Mr
Jones
;
which
Honour
told
him
*NL*
she
had
carried
all
that
day
in
her
bosom
,
and
began
to
despair
of
*NL*
finding
any
means
of
delivering
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamekeeper
returned
hastily
and
joyfully
to
Jones
,
who
,
having
*NL*
received
Sophia
's
letter
from
him
,
instantly
withdrew
,
and
eagerly
*NL*
breaking
it
open
,
read
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
SIR
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
to
express
what
I
have
felt
since
I
saw
you
.
Your
*NL*
submitting
,
on
my
account
,
to
such
cruel
insults
from
my
father
,
*NL*
lays
me
under
an
obligation
I
shall
ever
own
.
As
you
know
his
*NL*
temper
,
I
beg
you
will
,
for
my
sake
,
avoid
him
.
I
wish
I
had
any
*NL*
comfort
to
send
you
;
but
believe
this
,
that
nothing
but
the
last
*NL*
violence
shall
ever
give
my
hand
or
heart
where
you
would
be
sorry
*NL*
to
see
them
bestowed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
read
this
letter
a
hundred
times
over
,
and
kissed
it
a
hundred
*NL*
times
as
often
.
His
passion
now
brought
all
tender
desires
back
into
*NL*
his
mind
.
He
repented
that
he
had
writ
to
Sophia
in
the
manner
we
have
*NL*
seen
above
;
but
he
repented
more
that
he
had
made
use
of
the
interval
*NL*
of
his
messenger
's
absence
to
write
and
dispatch
a
letter
to
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
in
which
he
had
faithfully
promised
and
bound
himself
to
*NL*
quit
all
thoughts
of
his
love
.
However
,
when
his
cool
reflections
*NL*
returned
,
he
plainly
perceived
that
his
case
was
neither
mended
nor
*NL*
altered
by
Sophia
's
billet
,
unless
to
give
him
some
little
glimpse
of
*NL*
hope
,
from
her
constancy
,
of
some
favourable
accident
hereafter
.
He
*NL*
therefore
resumed
his
resolution
,
and
taking
leave
of
Black
George
,
*NL*
set
forward
to
a
town
about
five
miles
distant
,
whither
he
had
desired
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
,

*NL*
The
behaviour
of
Sophia
on
the
present
occasion
;
which
none
of
her
sex
*NL*
will
blame
,
who
are
capable
of
behaving
in
the
same
manner
.
And
the
*NL*
discussion
of
a
knotty
point
in
the
court
of
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
had
passed
the
last
twenty-four
hours
in
no
very
desirable
*NL*
manner
.
During
a
large
part
of
them
she
had
been
entertained
by
her
*NL*
aunt
with
lectures
of
prudence
,
recommending
to
her
the
example
of
the
*NL*
polite
world
,
where
love
-LRB-
so
the
good
lady
said
-RRB-
is
at
present
*NL*
entirely
laughed
at
,
and
where
women
consider
matrimony
,
as
men
do
*NL*
offices
of
public
trust
,
only
as
the
means
of
making
their
fortunes
,
*NL*
and
of
advancing
themselves
in
the
world
.
In
commenting
on
which
text
*NL*
Mrs
Western
had
displayed
her
eloquence
during
several
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
sagacious
lectures
,
though
little
suited
either
to
the
taste
or
*NL*
inclination
of
Sophia
,
were
,
however
,
less
irksome
to
her
than
her
own
*NL*
thoughts
,
that
formed
the
entertainment
of
the
night
,
during
which
she
*NL*
never
once
closed
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
she
could
neither
sleep
nor
rest
in
her
bed
,
yet
,
having
no
*NL*
avocation
from
it
,
she
was
found
there
by
her
father
at
his
return
*NL*
from
Allworthy
's
,
which
was
not
till
past
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
He
went
directly
up
to
her
apartment
,
opened
the
door
,
and
seeing
she
*NL*
was
not
up
,
cried
,
``
Oh
!
you
are
safe
then
,
and
I
am
resolved
to
keep
*NL*
you
so
.
''
He
then
locked
the
door
,
and
delivered
the
key
to
Honour
,
*NL*
having
first
given
her
the
strictest
charge
,
with
great
promises
of
*NL*
rewards
for
her
fidelity
,
and
most
dreadful
menaces
of
punishment
in
*NL*
case
she
should
betray
her
trust
.
*NL*
*NL*
Honour
's
orders
were
,
not
to
suffer
her
mistress
to
come
out
of
her
*NL*
room
without
the
authority
of
the
squire
himself
,
and
to
admit
none
to
*NL*
her
but
him
and
her
aunt
;
but
she
was
herself
to
attend
her
with
*NL*
whatever
Sophia
pleased
,
except
only
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
of
which
she
*NL*
was
forbidden
the
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
ordered
his
daughter
to
dress
herself
and
attend
him
at
*NL*
dinner
;
which
she
obeyed
;
and
having
sat
the
usual
time
,
was
again
*NL*
conducted
to
her
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
the
gaoler
Honour
brought
her
the
letter
which
she
*NL*
received
from
the
gamekeeper
.
Sophia
read
it
very
attentively
twice
or
*NL*
thrice
over
,
and
then
threw
herself
upon
the
bed
,
and
burst
into
a
*NL*
flood
of
tears
.
Mrs
Honour
expressed
great
astonishment
at
this
*NL*
behaviour
in
her
mistress
;
nor
could
she
forbear
very
eagerly
begging
*NL*
to
know
the
cause
of
this
passion
.
Sophia
made
her
no
answer
for
some
*NL*
time
,
and
then
,
starting
suddenly
up
,
caught
her
maid
by
the
hand
,
and
*NL*
cried
,
``
O
Honour
!
I
am
undone
.
''
``
Marry
forbid
,
''
cries
Honour
:
``
I
wish
*NL*
the
letter
had
been
burnt
before
I
had
brought
it
to
your
la
`
ship
.
I
'm
*NL*
sure
I
thought
it
would
have
comforted
your
la
`
ship
,
or
I
would
have
*NL*
seen
it
at
the
devil
before
I
would
have
touched
it
.
''
``
Honour
,
''
says
*NL*
Sophia
,
``
you
are
a
good
girl
,
and
it
is
vain
to
attempt
concealing
*NL*
longer
my
weakness
from
you
;
I
have
thrown
away
my
heart
on
a
man
who
*NL*
hath
forsaken
me
.
''
``
And
is
Mr
Jones
,
''
answered
the
maid
,
``
such
a
*NL*
perfidy
man
?
''
``
He
hath
taken
his
leave
of
me

says
Sophia
,
``
for
ever
*NL*
in
that
letter

Nay

he
hath
desired
me
to
forget
him

Could
he
have
*NL*
desired
that
if
he
had
loved
me
?
Could
he
have
borne
such
a
thought
?
*NL*
Could
he
have
written
such
a
word
?
''
``
No
,
certainly
,
ma'am
,
''
cries
*NL*
Honour
;
``
and
to
be
sure
,
if
the
best
man
in
England
was
to
desire
me
*NL*
to
forget
him
,
I
'd
take
him
at
his
word
.
Marry
,
come
up
!
I
am
sure
*NL*
your
la
`
ship
hath
done
him
too
much
honour
ever
to
think
on
him
;
--
a
*NL*
young
lady
who
may
take
her
choice
of
all
the
young
men
in
the
*NL*
country
.
And
to
be
sure
,
if
I
may
be
so
presumptuous
as
to
offer
my
*NL*
poor
opinion
,
there
is
young
Mr
Blifil
,
who
,
besides
that
he
is
come
*NL*
of
honest
parents
,
and
will
be
one
of
the
greatest
squires
all
*NL*
hereabouts
,
he
is
to
be
sure
,
in
my
poor
opinion
,
a
more
handsomer
and
*NL*
a
more
politer
man
by
half
;
and
besides
,
he
is
a
young
gentleman
of
a
*NL*
sober
character
,
and
who
may
defy
any
of
the
neighbours
to
say
black
*NL*
is
his
eye
;
he
follows
no
dirty
trollops
,
nor
can
any
bastards
be
laid
*NL*
at
his
door
.
Forget
him
,
indeed
!
I
thank
Heaven
I
myself
am
not
so
*NL*
much
at
my
last
prayers
as
to
suffer
any
man
to
bid
me
forget
him
*NL*
twice
.
If
the
best
he
that
wears
a
head
was
for
to
go
for
to
offer
to
*NL*
say
such
an
affronting
word
to
me
,
I
would
never
give
him
my
company
*NL*
afterwards
,
if
there
was
another
young
man
in
the
kingdom
.
And
as
I
*NL*
was
a
saying
,
to
be
sure
,
there
is
young
Mr
Blifil

``
Name

next

No

O

it

nothing

offered
to

love

the

stripped

For
Heaven

not

is
enough

as

never

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
departed
according
to
orders
,
and
finding
Black
George
*NL*
below-stairs
,
delivered
him
the
purse
,
which
contained
sixteen
*NL*
guineas
,
being
,
indeed
,
the
whole
stock
of
Sophia
;
for
though
her
*NL*
father
was
very
liberal
to
her
,
she
was
much
too
generous
to
be
rich
.
*NL*
*NL*
Black
George
having
received
the
purse
,
set
forward
towards
the
*NL*
alehouse
;
but
in
the
way
a
thought
occurred
to
him
,
whether
he
should
*NL*
not
detain
this
money
likewise
.
His
conscience
,
however
,
immediately
*NL*
started
at
this
suggestion
,
and
began
to
upbraid
him
with
ingratitude
*NL*
to
his
benefactor
.
To
this
his
avarice
answered
,
That
his
conscience
*NL*
should
have
considered
the
matter
before
,
when
he
deprived
poor
Jones
*NL*
of
his
L500
.
That
having
quietly
acquiesced
in
what
was
of
so
much
*NL*
greater
importance
,
it
was
absurd
,
if
not
downright
hypocrisy
,
to
*NL*
affect
any
qualms
at
this
trifle
.
In
return
to
which
,
Conscience
,
like
*NL*
a
good
lawyer
,
attempted
to
distinguish
between
an
absolute
breach
of
*NL*
trust
,
as
here
,
where
the
goods
were
delivered
,
and
a
bare
concealment
*NL*
of
what
was
found
,
as
in
the
former
case
.
Avarice
presently
treated
*NL*
this
with
ridicule
,
called
it
a
distinction
without
a
difference
,
and
*NL*
absolutely
insisted
that
when
once
all
pretensions
of
honour
and
*NL*
virtue
were
given
up
in
any
one
instance
,
that
there
was
no
precedent
*NL*
for
resorting
to
them
upon
a
second
occasion
.
In
short
,
poor
*NL*
Conscience
had
certainly
been
defeated
in
the
argument
,
had
not
Fear
*NL*
stept
in
to
her
assistance
,
and
very
strenuously
urged
that
the
real
*NL*
distinction
between
the
two
actions
,
did
not
lie
in
the
different
*NL*
degrees
of
honour
but
of
safety
:
for
that
the
secreting
the
L500
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
very
little
hazard
;
whereas
the
detaining
the
sixteen
*NL*
guineas
was
liable
to
the
utmost
danger
of
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
friendly
aid
of
Fear
,
Conscience
obtained
a
compleat
victory
*NL*
in
the
mind
of
Black
George
,
and
,
after
making
him
a
few
compliments
*NL*
on
his
honesty
,
forced
him
to
deliver
the
money
to
Jones
.

Chapter
xiv
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
chapter
,
containing
a
short
dialogue
between
Squire
Western
*NL*
and
his
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
had
been
engaged
abroad
all
that
day
.
The
squire
met
her
*NL*
at
her
return
home
;
and
when
she
enquired
after
Sophia
,
he
acquainted
*NL*
her
that
he
had
secured
her
safe
enough
.
``
She
is
locked
up
in
*NL*
chamber
,
''
cries
he
,
``
and
Honour
keeps
the
key
.
''
As
his
looks
were
full
*NL*
of
prodigious
wisdom
and
sagacity
when
he
gave
his
sister
this
*NL*
information
,
it
is
probable
he
expected
much
applause
from
her
for
*NL*
what
he
had
done
;
but
how
was
he
disappointed
when
,
with
a
most
*NL*
disdainful
aspect
,
she
cried
,
``
Sure
,
brother
,
you
are
the
weakest
of
*NL*
all
men
.
Why
will
you
not
confide
in
me
for
the
management
of
my
*NL*
niece
?
Why
will
you
interpose
?
You
have
now
undone
all
that
I
have
*NL*
been
spending
my
breath
in
order
to
bring
about
.
While
I
have
been
*NL*
endeavouring
to
fill
her
mind
with
maxims
of
prudence
,
you
have
been
*NL*
provoking
her
to
reject
them
.
English
women
,
brother
,
I
thank
heaven
,
*NL*
are
no
slaves
.
We
are
not
to
be
locked
up
like
the
Spanish
and
Italian
*NL*
wives
.
We
have
as
good
a
right
to
liberty
as
yourselves
.
We
are
to
be
*NL*
convinced
by
reason
and
persuasion
only
,
and
not
governed
by
force
.
I
*NL*
have
seen
the
world
,
brother
,
and
know
what
arguments
to
make
use
of
;
*NL*
and
if
your
folly
had
not
prevented
me
,
should
have
prevailed
with
her
*NL*
to
form
her
conduct
by
those
rules
of
prudence
and
discretion
which
I
*NL*
formerly
taught
her
.
''
``
To
be
sure
,
''
said
the
squire
,
``
I
am
always
in
*NL*
the
wrong
.
''
``
Brother
,
''
answered
the
lady
,
``
you
are
not
in
the
wrong
,
*NL*
unless
when
you
meddle
with
matters
beyond
your
knowledge
.
You
must
*NL*
agree
that
I
have
seen
most
of
the
world
;
and
happy
had
it
been
for
my
*NL*
niece
if
she
had
not
been
taken
from
under
my
care
.
It
is
by
living
at
*NL*
home
with
you
that
she
hath
learnt
romantic
notions
of
love
and
*NL*
nonsense
.
''
``
You
do
n't
imagine
,
I
hope
,
''
cries
the
squire
,
``
that
I
have
*NL*
taught
her
any
such
things
.
''
``
Your
ignorance

brother
,

CONTAINING

DAYS

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
comparison
between
the
world
and
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
world
hath
been
often
compared
to
the
theatre
;
and
many
grave
*NL*
writers
,
as
well
as
the
poets
,
have
considered
human
life
as
a
great
*NL*
drama
,
resembling
,
in
almost
every
particular
,
those
scenical
*NL*
representations
which
Thespis
is
first
reported
to
have
invented
,
and
*NL*
which
have
been
since
received
with
so
much
approbation
and
delight
in
*NL*
all
polite
countries
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
thought
hath
been
carried
so
far
,
and
is
become
so
general
,
that
*NL*
some
words
proper
to
the
theatre
,
and
which
were
at
first
*NL*
metaphorically
applied
to
the
world
,
are
now
indiscriminately
and
*NL*
literally
spoken
of
both
;
thus
stage
and
scene
are
by
common
use
grown
*NL*
as
familiar
to
us
,
when
we
speak
of
life
in
general
,
as
when
we
*NL*
confine
ourselves
to
dramatic
performances
:
and
when
transactions
*NL*
behind
the
curtain
are
mentioned
,
St
James
's
is
more
likely
to
occur
*NL*
to
our
thoughts
than
Drury-lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
seem
easy
enough
to
account
for
all
this
,
by
reflecting
that
*NL*
the
theatrical
stage
is
nothing
more
than
a
representation
,
or
,
as
*NL*
Aristotle
calls
it
,
an
imitation
of
what
really
exists
;
and
hence
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
we
might
fairly
pay
a
very
high
compliment
to
those
who
by
*NL*
their
writings
or
actions
have
been
so
capable
of
imitating
life
,
as
*NL*
to
have
their
pictures
in
a
manner
confounded
with
,
or
mistaken
for
,
*NL*
the
originals
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
reality
,
we
are
not
so
fond
of
paying
compliments
to
these
*NL*
people
,
whom
we
use
as
children
frequently
do
the
instruments
of
their
*NL*
amusement
;
and
have
much
more
pleasure
in
hissing
and
buffeting
them
,
*NL*
than
in
admiring
their
excellence
.
There
are
many
other
reasons
which
*NL*
have
induced
us
to
see
this
analogy
between
the
world
and
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
have
considered
the
larger
part
of
mankind
in
the
light
of
*NL*
actors
,
as
personating
characters
no
more
their
own
,
and
to
which
in
*NL*
fact
they
have
no
better
title
,
than
the
player
hath
to
be
in
earnest
*NL*
thought
the
king
or
emperor
whom
he
represents
.
Thus
the
hypocrite
may
*NL*
be
said
to
be
a
player
;
and
indeed
the
Greeks
called
them
both
by
one
*NL*
and
the
same
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brevity
of
life
hath
likewise
given
occasion
to
this
comparison
.
*NL*
So
the
immortal
Shakespear
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Life
's
a
poor
player
,
*NL*
That
struts
and
frets
his
hour
upon
the
stage
,
*NL*
And
then
is
heard
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
which
hackneyed
quotation
I
will
make
the
reader
amends
by
a
very
*NL*
noble
one
,
which
few
,
I
believe
,
have
read
.
It
is
taken
from
a
poem
*NL*
called
the
Deity
,
published
about
nine
years
ago
,
and
long
since
*NL*
buried
in
oblivion
;
a
proof
that
good
books
,
no
more
than
good
men
,
do
*NL*
always
survive
the
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Thee
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
all
human
actions
take
their
springs
,
*NL*
The
rise
of
empires
and
the
fall
of
kings
!
*NL*
See
the
vast
Theatre
of
Time
display
'd
,
*NL*
While
o'er
the
scene
succeeding
heroes
tread
!
*NL*
With
pomp
the
shining
images
succeed
,
*NL*
What
leaders
triumph
,
and
what
monarchs
bleed
!
*NL*
Perform
the
parts
thy
providence
assign
'd
,
*NL*
Their
pride
,
their
passions
,
to
thy
ends
inclin
'd
:
*NL*
Awhile
they
glitter
in
the
face
of
day
,
*NL*
Then
at
thy
nod
the
phantoms
pass
away
;
*NL*
No
traces
left
of
all
the
busy
scene
,
*NL*
But
that
remembrance
says
--
_
The
things
have
been
!
_
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
The
Deity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
these
,
however
,
and
in
every
other
similitude
of
life
to
the
*NL*
theatre
,
the
resemblance
hath
been
always
taken
from
the
stage
only
.
*NL*
None
,
as
I
remember
,
have
at
all
considered
the
audience
at
this
great
*NL*
drama
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
Nature
often
exhibits
some
of
her
best
performances
to
a
very
*NL*
full
house
,
so
will
the
behaviour
of
her
spectators
no
less
admit
the
*NL*
above-mentioned
comparison
than
that
of
her
actors
.
In
this
vast
*NL*
theatre
of
time
are
seated
the
friend
and
the
critic
;
here
are
claps
*NL*
and
shouts
,
hisses
and
groans
;
in
short
,
everything
which
was
ever
*NL*
seen
or
heard
at
the
Theatre-Royal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
examine
this
in
one
example
;
for
instance
,
in
the
behaviour
of
*NL*
the
great
audience
on
that
scene
which
Nature
was
pleased
to
exhibit
*NL*
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
the
preceding
book
,
where
she
introduced
*NL*
Black
George
running
away
with
the
L500
from
his
friend
and
*NL*
benefactor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
sat
in
the
world
's
upper
gallery
treated
that
incident
,
I
am
*NL*
well
convinced
,
with
their
usual
vociferation
;
and
every
term
of
*NL*
scurrilous
reproach
was
most
probably
vented
on
that
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
had
descended
to
the
next
order
of
spectators
,
we
should
have
*NL*
found
an
equal
degree
of
abhorrence
,
though
less
of
noise
and
*NL*
scurrility
;
yet
here
the
good
women
gave
Black
George
to
the
devil
,
*NL*
and
many
of
them
expected
every
minute
that
the
cloven-footed
*NL*
gentleman
would
fetch
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pit
,
as
usual
,
was
no
doubt
divided
;
those
who
delight
in
heroic
*NL*
virtue
and
perfect
character
objected
to
the
producing
such
instances
*NL*
of
villany
,
without
punishing
them
very
severely
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
example
.
Some
of
the
author
's
friends
cryed
,
``
Look
`
e
,
gentlemen
,
the
*NL*
man
is
a
villain
,
but
it
is
nature
for
all
that
.
''
And
all
the
young
*NL*
critics
of
the
age
,
the
clerks
,
apprentices
,
&
c.
,
called
it
low
,
and
*NL*
fell
a
groaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
boxes
,
they
behaved
with
their
accustomed
politeness
.
Most
*NL*
of
them
were
attending
to
something
else
.
Some
of
those
few
who
*NL*
regarded
the
scene
at
all
,
declared
he
was
a
bad
kind
of
man
;
while
*NL*
others
refused
to
give
their
opinion
,
till
they
had
heard
that
of
the
*NL*
best
judges
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
we
,
who
are
admitted
behind
the
scenes
of
this
great
theatre
of
*NL*
Nature
-LRB-
and
no
author
ought
to
write
anything
besides
dictionaries
and
*NL*
spelling-books
who
hath
not
this
privilege
-RRB-
,
can
censure
the
action
,
*NL*
without
conceiving
any
absolute
detestation
of
the
person
,
whom
*NL*
perhaps
Nature
may
not
have
designed
to
act
an
ill
part
in
all
her
*NL*
dramas
;
for
in
this
instance
life
most
exactly
resembles
the
stage
,
*NL*
since
it
is
often
the
same
person
who
represents
the
villain
and
the
*NL*
heroe
;
and
he
who
engages
your
admiration
to-day
will
probably
attract
*NL*
your
contempt
to-morrow
.
As
Garrick
,
whom
I
regard
in
tragedy
to
be
*NL*
the
greatest
genius
the
world
hath
ever
produced
,
sometimes
*NL*
condescends
to
play
the
fool
;
so
did
Scipio
the
Great
,
and
Laelius
the
*NL*
Wise
,
according
to
Horace
,
many
years
ago
;
nay
,
Cicero
reports
them
to
*NL*
have
been
``
incredibly
childish
.
''
These
,
it
is
true
,
played
the
fool
,
*NL*
like
my
friend
Garrick
,
in
jest
only
;
but
several
eminent
characters
*NL*
have
,
in
numberless
instances
of
their
lives
,
played
the
fool
*NL*
egregiously
in
earnest
;
so
far
as
to
render
it
a
matter
of
some
doubt
*NL*
whether
their
wisdom
or
folly
was
predominant
;
or
whether
they
were
*NL*
better
intitled
to
the
applause
or
censure
,
the
admiration
or
*NL*
contempt
,
the
love
or
hatred
,
of
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
persons
,
indeed
,
who
have
passed
any
time
behind
the
scenes
of
*NL*
this
great
theatre
,
and
are
thoroughly
acquainted
not
only
with
the
*NL*
several
disguises
which
are
there
put
on
,
but
also
with
the
fantastic
*NL*
and
capricious
behaviour
of
the
Passions
,
who
are
the
managers
and
*NL*
directors
of
this
theatre
-LRB-
for
as
to
Reason
,
the
patentee
,
he
is
known
*NL*
to
be
a
very
idle
fellow
and
seldom
to
exert
himself
-RRB-
,
may
most
*NL*
probably
have
learned
to
understand
the
famous
_
nil
admirari
_
of
*NL*
Horace
,
or
in
the
English
phrase
,
to
stare
at
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
single
bad
act
no
more
constitutes
a
villain
in
life
,
than
a
single
*NL*
bad
part
on
the
stage
.
The
passions
,
like
the
managers
of
a
playhouse
,
*NL*
often
force
men
upon
parts
without
consulting
their
judgment
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
without
any
regard
to
their
talents
.
Thus
the
man
,
as
well
*NL*
as
the
player
,
may
condemn
what
he
himself
acts
;
nay
,
it
is
common
to
*NL*
see
vice
sit
as
awkwardly
on
some
men
,
as
the
character
of
Iago
would
*NL*
on
the
honest
face
of
Mr
William
Mills
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
whole
,
then
,
the
man
of
candour
and
of
true
understanding
is
*NL*
never
hasty
to
condemn
.
He
can
censure
an
imperfection
,
or
even
a
*NL*
vice
,
without
rage
against
the
guilty
party
.
In
a
word
,
they
are
the
*NL*
same
folly
,
the
same
childishness
,
the
same
ill-breeding
,
and
the
same
*NL*
ill-nature
,
which
raise
all
the
clamours
and
uproars
both
in
life
and
*NL*
on
the
stage
.
The
worst
of
men
generally
have
the
words
rogue
and
*NL*
villain
most
in
their
mouths
,
as
the
lowest
of
all
wretches
are
the
*NL*
aptest
to
cry
out
low
in
the
pit
.

Jones
received
his

from
Mr

early

*NL*
with
the

*NL*
Many
contending
passions
were
raised
in
our
heroe
's
mind
by
this
*NL*
letter
;
but
the
tender
prevailed
at
last
over
the
indignant
and
*NL*
irascible
,
and
a
flood
of
tears
came
seasonably
to
his
assistance
,
and
*NL*
possibly
prevented
his
misfortunes
from
either
turning
his
head
,
or
*NL*
bursting
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
grew
,
however
,
soon
ashamed
of
indulging
this
remedy
;
and
starting
*NL*
up
,
he
cried
,
``
Well
,
then
,
I
will
give
Mr
Allworthy
the
only
instance
*NL*
he
requires
of
my
obedience
.
I
will
go
this
moment
--
but
whither
?
--
why
,
*NL*
let
Fortune
direct
;
since
there
is
no
other
who
thinks
it
of
any
*NL*
consequence
what
becomes
of
this
wretched
person
,
it
shall
be
a
matter
*NL*
of
equal
indifference
to
myself
.
Shall
I
alone
regard
what
no
*NL*
other
--
Ha
!
have
I
not
reason
to
think
there
is
another
?
--
one
whose
*NL*
value
is
above
that
of
the
whole
world
!
--
I
may
,
I
must
imagine
my
*NL*
Sophia
is
not
indifferent
to
what
becomes
of
me
.
Shall
I
then
leave
*NL*
this
only
friend
--
and
such
a
friend
?
Shall
I
not
stay
with
*NL*
her
?
--
Where
--
how
can
I
stay
with
her
?
Have
I
any
hopes
of
ever
seeing
*NL*
her
,
though
she
was
as
desirous
as
myself
,
without
exposing
her
to
the
*NL*
wrath
of
her
father
,
and
to
what
purpose
?
Can
I
think
of
soliciting
*NL*
such
a
creature
to
consent
to
her
own
ruin
?
Shall
I
indulge
any
*NL*
passion
of
mine
at
such
a
price
?
Shall
I
lurk
about
this
country
like
*NL*
a
thief
,
with
such
intentions
?
--
No
,
I
disdain
,
I
detest
the
thought
.
*NL*
Farewel
,
Sophia
;
farewel
,
most
lovely
,
most
beloved
--
''
Here
passion
*NL*
stopped
his
mouth
,
and
found
a
vent
at
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
having
taken
a
resolution
to
leave
the
country
,
he
began
to
*NL*
debate
with
himself
whither
he
should
go
.
The
world
,
as
Milton
phrases
*NL*
it
,
lay
all
before
him
;
and
Jones
,
no
more
than
Adam
,
had
any
man
to
*NL*
whom
he
might
resort
for
comfort
or
assistance
.
All
his
acquaintance
*NL*
were
the
acquaintance
of
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
he
had
no
reason
to
expect
*NL*
any
countenance
from
them
,
as
that
gentleman
had
withdrawn
his
favour
*NL*
from
him
.
Men
of
great
and
good
characters
should
indeed
be
very
*NL*
cautious
how
they
discard
their
dependents
;
for
the
consequence
to
the
*NL*
unhappy
sufferer
is
being
discarded
by
all
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
course
of
life
to
pursue
,
or
to
what
business
to
apply
himself
,
*NL*
was
a
second
consideration
:
and
here
the
prospect
was
all
a
melancholy
*NL*
void
.
Every
profession
,
and
every
trade
,
required
length
of
time
,
and
*NL*
what
was
worse
,
money
;
for
matters
are
so
constituted
,
that
``
nothing
*NL*
out
of
nothing
''
is
not
a
truer
maxim
in
physics
than
in
politics
;
and
*NL*
every
man
who
is
greatly
destitute
of
money
,
is
on
that
account
*NL*
entirely
excluded
from
all
means
of
acquiring
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
Ocean
,
that
hospitable
friend
to
the
wretched
,
opened
her
*NL*
capacious
arms
to
receive
him
;
and
he
instantly
resolved
to
accept
her
*NL*
kind
invitation
.
To
express
myself
less
figuratively
,
he
determined
to
*NL*
go
to
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
thought
indeed
no
sooner
suggested
itself
,
than
he
eagerly
*NL*
embraced
it
;
and
having
presently
hired
horses
,
he
set
out
for
Bristol
*NL*
to
put
it
in
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
we
attend
him
on
this
expedition
,
we
shall
resort
awhile
to
*NL*
Mr
Western
's
,
and
see
what
further
happened
to
the
charming
Sophia
.

Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
several
dialogues
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
in
which
Mr
Jones
departed
,
Mrs
Western
summoned
Sophia
*NL*
into
her
apartment
;
and
having
first
acquainted
her
that
she
had
*NL*
obtained
her
liberty
of
her
father
,
she
proceeded
to
read
her
a
long
*NL*
lecture
on
the
subject
of
matrimony
;
which
she
treated
not
as
a
*NL*
romantic
scheme
of
happiness
arising
from
love
,
as
it
hath
been
*NL*
described
by
the
poets
;
nor
did
she
mention
any
of
those
purposes
for
*NL*
which
we
are
taught
by
divines
to
regard
it
as
instituted
by
sacred
*NL*
authority
;
she
considered
it
rather
as
a
fund
in
which
prudent
women
*NL*
deposit
their
fortunes
to
the
best
advantage
,
in
order
to
receive
a
*NL*
larger
interest
for
them
than
they
could
have
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs
Western
had
finished
,
Sophia
answered
,
``
That
she
was
very
*NL*
incapable
of
arguing
with
a
lady
of
her
aunt
's
superior
knowledge
and
*NL*
experience
,
especially
on
a
subject
which
she
had
so
very
little
*NL*
considered
,
as
this
of
matrimony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Argue
with
me
,
child
!
''
replied
the
other
;
``
I
do
not
indeed
expect
it
.
*NL*
I
should
have
seen
the
world
to
very
little
purpose
truly
,
if
I
am
to
*NL*
argue
with
one
of
your
years
.
I
have
taken
this
trouble
,
in
order
to
*NL*
instruct
you
.
The
antient
philosophers
,
such
as
Socrates
,
Alcibiades
,
*NL*
and
others
,
did
not
use
to
argue
with
their
scholars
.
You
are
to
*NL*
consider
me
,
child
,
as
Socrates
,
not
asking
your
opinion
,
but
only
*NL*
informing
you
of
mine
.
''
From
which
last
words
the
reader
may
possibly
*NL*
imagine
,
that
this
lady
had
read
no
more
of
the
philosophy
of
*NL*
Socrates
,
than
she
had
of
that
of
Alcibiades
;
and
indeed
we
can
not
*NL*
resolve
his
curiosity
as
to
this
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
``
I
have
never
presumed
to
controvert
any
*NL*
opinion
of
yours
;
and
this
subject
,
as
I
said
,
I
have
never
yet
*NL*
thought
of
,
and
perhaps
never
may
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Sophy
,
''
replied
the
aunt
,
``
this
dissimulation
with
me
is
very
*NL*
foolish
.
The
French
shall
as
soon
persuade
me
that
they
take
foreign
*NL*
towns
in
defence
only
of
their
own
country
,
as
you
can
impose
on
me
to
*NL*
believe
you
have
never
yet
thought
seriously
of
matrimony
.
How
can
*NL*
you
,
child
,
affect
to
deny
that
you
have
considered
of
contracting
an
*NL*
alliance
,
when
you
so
well
know
I
am
acquainted
with
the
party
with
*NL*
whom
you
desire
to
contract
it
?
--
an
alliance
as
unnatural
,
and
*NL*
contrary
to
your
interest
,
as
a
separate
league
with
the
French
would
*NL*
be
to
the
interest
of
the
Dutch
!
But
however
,
if
you
have
not
hitherto
*NL*
considered
of
this
matter
,
I
promise
you
it
is
now
high
time
,
for
my
*NL*
brother
is
resolved
immediately
to
conclude
the
treaty
with
Mr
Blifil
;
*NL*
and
indeed
I
am
a
sort
of
guarantee
in
the
affair
,
and
have
promised
*NL*
your
concurrence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
``
this
is
the
only
instance
in
which
I
*NL*
must
disobey
both
yourself
and
my
father
.
For
this
is
a
match
which
*NL*
requires
very
little
consideration
in
me
to
refuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
was
not
as
great
a
philosopher
as
Socrates
himself
,
''
returned
*NL*
Mrs
Western
,
``
you
would
overcome
my
patience
.
What
objection
can
you
*NL*
have
to
the
young
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
solid
objection
,
in
my
opinion
,
''
says
Sophia
--
``
I
hate
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
never
learn
a
proper
use
of
words
?
''
answered
the
aunt
.
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
child
,
you
should
consult
Bailey
's
Dictionary
.
It
is
*NL*
impossible
you
should
hate
a
man
from
whom
you
have
received
no
*NL*
injury
.
By
hatred
,
therefore
,
you
mean
no
more
than
dislike
,
which
is
*NL*
no
sufficient
objection
against
your
marrying
of
him
.
I
have
known
*NL*
many
couples
,
who
have
entirely
disliked
each
other
,
lead
very
*NL*
comfortable
genteel
lives
.
Believe
me
,
child
,
I
know
these
things
*NL*
better
than
you
.
You
will
allow
me
,
I
think
,
to
have
seen
the
world
,
*NL*
in
which
I
have
not
an
acquaintance
who
would
not
rather
be
thought
to
*NL*
dislike
her
husband
than
to
like
him
.
The
contrary
is
such
*NL*
out-of-fashion
romantic
nonsense
,
that
the
very
imagination
of
it
is
*NL*
shocking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
replied
Sophia
,
``
I
shall
never
marry
a
man
I
dislike

*NL*
If
I
promise
my
father
never
to
consent
to
any
marriage
contrary
to
*NL*
his
inclinations
,
I
think
I
may
hope
he
will
never
force
me
into
that
*NL*
state
contrary
to
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inclinations
!
''
cries
the
aunt
,
with
some
warmth
.
``
Inclinations
!
I
am
*NL*
astonished
at
your
assurance

A
young
woman
of
your
age
,
and
*NL*
unmarried
,
to
talk
of
inclinations
!
But
whatever
your
inclinations
may
*NL*
be
,
my
brother
is
resolved
;
nay
,
since
you
talk
of
inclinations

I

shall
advise
him
to
hasten
the
treaty

Inclinations

*NL*
Sophia
then
flung
herself
upon
her
knees
,
and
tears
began
to
trickle
*NL*
from
her
shining
eyes
.
She
entreated
her
aunt
,
``
to
have
mercy
upon
*NL*
her
,
and
not
to
resent
so
cruelly
her
unwillingness
to
make
herself
*NL*
miserable
;
''
often
urging
,
``
that
she
alone
was
concerned
,
and
that
her
*NL*
happiness
only
was
at
stake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
bailiff
,
when
well
authorized
by
his
writ
,
having
possessed
*NL*
himself
of
the
person
of
some
unhappy
debtor
,
views
all
his
tears
*NL*
without
concern
;
in
vain
the
wretched
captive
attempts
to
raise
*NL*
compassion
;
in
vain
the
tender
wife
bereft
of
her
companion
,
the
*NL*
little
prattling
boy
,
or
frighted
girl
,
are
mentioned
as
inducements
*NL*
to
reluctance
.
The
noble
bumtrap
,
blind
and
deaf
to
every
circumstance
*NL*
of
distress
,
greatly
rises
above
all
the
motives
to
humanity
,
and
into
*NL*
the
hands
of
the
gaoler
resolves
to
deliver
his
miserable
prey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
less
blind
to
the
tears
,
or
less
deaf
to
every
entreaty
of
Sophia
*NL*
was
the
politic
aunt
,
nor
less
determined
was
she
to
deliver
over
the
*NL*
trembling
maid
into
the
arms
of
the
gaoler
Blifil
.
She
answered
with
*NL*
great
impetuosity
,
``
So
far
,
madam
,
from
your
being
concerned
alone
,
*NL*
your
concern
is
the
least
,
or
surely
the
least
important
.
It
is
the
*NL*
honour
of
your
family
which
is
concerned
in
this
alliance
;
you
are
*NL*
only
the
instrument
.
Do
you
conceive
,
mistress
,
that
in
an
*NL*
intermarriage
between
kingdoms
,
as
when
a
daughter
of
France
is
*NL*
married
into
Spain
,
the
princess
herself
is
alone
considered
in
the
*NL*
match
?
No
!
it
is
a
match
between
two
kingdoms
,
rather
than
between
two
*NL*
persons
.
The
same
happens
in
great
families
such
as
ours
.
The
alliance
*NL*
between
the
families
is
the
principal
matter
.
You
ought
to
have
a
*NL*
greater
regard
for
the
honour
of
your
family
than
for
your
own
person
;
*NL*
and
if
the
example
of
a
princess
can
not
inspire
you
with
these
noble
*NL*
thoughts
,
you
can
not
surely
complain
at
being
used
no
worse
than
all
*NL*
princesses
are
used
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope

madam

cries
Sophia
,
with
a
little
elevation
of
voice
,
``
I
*NL*
shall
never
do
anything
to
dishonour
my
family

but
as
for
Mr
Blifil

may
be
the
consequence

I
am
resolved
against

no

Western
,
who
had
been
within
hearing
during
the
greater
part
of
the
*NL*
preceding
dialogue

had
now
exhausted
all
his
patience

he
therefore

entered

*NL*
Mrs
Western
had
collected
a
sufficient
quantity
of
wrath
for
the
use
*NL*
of
Sophia
;

she
now
transferred
it
all
to
the
squire

said
she
,
``
it
is
astonishing

interfere

matter

you
had
totally
left
to
my
negotiation

Regard
to

made

take
upon

those
mistakes

preposterous
conduct

hath
eradicated
all
the
seeds
that
I
had

formerly
sown
in

tender
mind

you
yourself

have
taught

her
disobedience

``
Blood
!

cries
the
squire
,
foaming
at
the
mouth
,
*NL*
``
you
are
enough
to
conquer
the
patience

disobedience

Here
she

obedient

was

a
little
child

before
you

took
her
in

spoiled

by
filling
her
head
with
a
pack
of

court
notions

did
I
not
overhear
you
telling
her

Mrs

,
with
an
air
of
great
disdain
,
*NL*

not
express
the
contempt
I
have
for
your
politics
of
all
kinds
;
*NL*
but
I
will
appeal
likewise
to
the
young
lady
herself
,
whether
I
have
*NL*
ever
taught
her
any
principles
of
disobedience
.
On
the
contrary
,
*NL*
niece
,
have
I
not
endeavoured
to
inspire
you
with
a
true
idea
of
the
*NL*
several
relations
in
which
a
human
creature
stands
in
society
?
Have
I
*NL*
not
taken
infinite
pains
to
show
you
,
that
the
law
of
nature
hath
*NL*
enjoined
a
duty
on
children
to
their
parents
?
Have
I
not
told
you
what
*NL*
Plato
says
on
that
subject
?
--
a
subject
on
which
you
was
so
notoriously
*NL*
ignorant
when
you
came
first
under
my
care
,
that
I
verily
believe
you
*NL*
did
not
know
the
relation
between
a
daughter
and
a
father
.
''
--
''
'T
is
a
*NL*
lie
,
''
answered
Western
.
``
The
girl
is
no
such
fool
,
as
to
live
to
*NL*
eleven
years
old
without
knowing
that
she
was
her
father
's
*NL*
relation
.
''
--
``
O
!
more
than
Gothic
ignorance

''
answered
the
lady
.
``
And
*NL*
as
for
your
manners

I
must
tell
you
,
they
deserve
a

``
Why
then
you
may
gi

it
me
,
if
you
think
you
are
able

''
cries
*NL*
the
squire
;
``
nay
,
I
suppose
your
niece
there
will
be
ready
enough
to
*NL*
help
you

``
Brother

''
said
Mrs
Western
,
``
though
I
despise
you
beyond

expression
,
yet
I
shall
endure
your
insolence
no
longer
;
so
I
desire
*NL*
my
coach
may
be
got
ready
immediately
,
for
I
am
resolved
to
leave
your
*NL*
house
this
very
morning
.
''
--
``
And
a
good
riddance
too
,
''
answered
he
;
``
I
*NL*
can
bear
your
insolence
no
longer

an
you
come
to
that

Blood
!
it
is
*NL*
almost
enough
of
itself
to
make
my
daughter
undervalue
my
sense
,
when
*NL*
she
hears
you
telling
me
every
minute
you
despise
me

''
--
``
It
is
*NL*
impossible
,
it
is
impossible

''
cries
the
aunt
;
``
no
one
can
undervalue
*NL*
such
a
boor
.
''
--
``
Boar
,
''
answered
the
squire
,
``
I
am
no
boar
;
no
,
nor
*NL*
ass
;
no
,
nor
rat
neither
,
madam

Remember
that
--
I
am
no
rat
.
I
am
a
*NL*
true
Englishman
,
and
not
of
your
Hanover
breed
,
that
have
eat
up
the
*NL*
nation
.
''
--
``
Thou
art
one
of
those
wise
men
,
''
cries
she
,
``
whose
*NL*
nonsensical
principles
have
undone
the
nation
;
by
weakening
the
hands
*NL*
of
our
government
at
home
,
and
by
discouraging
our
friends
and
*NL*
encouraging
our
enemies
abroad
.
''
--
``
Ho
!
are
you
come
back
to
your
*NL*
politics
?
''
cries
the
squire
:
``
as
for
those
I
despise
them
as
much
as
I
*NL*
do
a
f

t.
''
Which
last
words
he
accompanied
and
graced
with
the
very
*NL*
action
,
which
,
of
all
others
,
was
the
most
proper
to
it
.
And
whether
*NL*
it
was
this
word
or
the
contempt
exprest
for
her
politics
,
which
most
*NL*
affected
Mrs
Western
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
she
flew
into
the
most
*NL*
violent
rage
,
uttered
phrases
improper
to
be
here
related
,
and
*NL*
instantly
burst
out
of
the
house
.
Nor
did
her
brother
or
her
niece
*NL*
think
proper
either
to
stop
or
to
follow
her
;
for
the
one
was
so
much
*NL*
possessed
by
concern
,
and
the
other
by
anger
,
that
they
were
rendered
*NL*
almost
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
,
however
,
sent
after
his
sister
the
same
holloa
which
*NL*
attends
the
departure
of
a
hare
,
when
she
is
first
started
before
the
*NL*
hounds
.
He
was
indeed
a
great
master
of
this
kind
of
vociferation
,
and
*NL*
had
a
holla
proper
for
most
occasions
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Women
who
,
like
Mrs
Western
,
know
the
world
,
and
have
applied
*NL*
themselves
to
philosophy
and
politics
,
would
have
immediately
availed
*NL*
themselves
of
the
present
disposition
of
Mr
Western
's
mind
,
by
*NL*
throwing
in
a
few
artful
compliments
to
his
understanding
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
his
absent
adversary
;
but
poor
Sophia
was
all
simplicity
.
*NL*
By
which
word
we
do
not
intend
to
insinuate
to
the
reader
,
that
she
*NL*
was
silly
,
which
is
generally
understood
as
a
synonymous
term
with
*NL*
simple
;
for
she
was
indeed
a
most
sensible
girl
,
and
her
understanding
*NL*
was
of
the
first
rate
;
but
she
wanted
all
that
useful
art
which
*NL*
females
convert
to
so
many
good
purposes
in
life
,
and
which
,
as
it
*NL*
rather
arises
from
the
heart
than
from
the
head
,
is
often
the
property
*NL*
of
the
silliest
of
women

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
having
finished
his
holla
,
and
taken
a
little
breath
,
began
*NL*
to
lament
,
in
very
pathetic
terms
,
the
unfortunate
condition
of
men
,
*NL*
who
are
,
says
he
,
``
always
whipt
in

of
some
d

*NL*
or

I
think
I
was
hard
run
enough
by
your

for

man
;
*NL*
but
after
giving
her
a
dodge
,
here

if

manner
by

*NL*
o'um
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
never
had
a
single
dispute
with
her
father
,
till
this
unlucky
*NL*
affair
of
Blifil
,
on
any
account
,
except
in
defence
of
her
mother
,
*NL*
whom
she
had
loved
most
tenderly
,
though
she
lost
her
in
the
eleventh
*NL*
year
of
her
age
.
The
squire
,
to
whom
that
poor
woman
had
been
a
*NL*
faithful
upper-servant
all
the
time
of
their
marriage
,
had
returned
*NL*
that
behaviour
by
making
what
the
world
calls
a
good
husband
.
He
very
*NL*
seldom
swore
at
her
-LRB-
perhaps
not
above
once
a
week
-RRB-
and
never
beat
*NL*
her
;
she
had
not
the
least
occasion
for
jealousy
,
and
was
perfect
*NL*
mistress
of
her
time
;
for
she
was
never
interrupted
by
her
husband
,
*NL*
who
was
engaged
all
the
morning
in
his
field
exercises
,
and
all
the
*NL*
evening
with
bottle
companions
.
She
scarce
indeed
ever
saw
him
but
at
*NL*
meals
;
where
she
had
the
pleasure
of
carving
those
dishes
which
she
*NL*
had
before
attended
at
the
dressing
.
From
these
meals
she
retired
*NL*
about
five
minutes
after
the
other
servants
,
having
only
stayed
to
*NL*
drink
``
the
king
over
the
water
.
''
Such
were
,
it
seems
,
Mr
Western
's
*NL*
orders
;
for
it
was
a
maxim
with
him
,
that
women
should
come
in
with
*NL*
the
first
dish
,
and
go
out
after
the
first
glass
.
Obedience
to
these
*NL*
orders
was
perhaps
no
difficult
task
;
for
the
conversation
-LRB-
if
it
may
*NL*
be
called
so
-RRB-
was
seldom
such
as
could
entertain
a
lady
.
It
consisted
*NL*
chiefly
of
hallowing
,
singing
,
relations
of
sporting
adventures
,
*NL*
b
--
d
--
y
,
and
abuse
of
women
,
and
of
the
government
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
,
however
,
were
the
only
seasons
when
Mr
Western
saw
his
wife
;
*NL*
for
when
he
repaired
to
her
bed
,
he
was
generally
so
drunk
that
he
*NL*
could
not
see
;
and
in
the
sporting
season
he
always
rose
from
her
*NL*
before
it
was
light
.
Thus
was
she
perfect
mistress
of
her
time
,
and
*NL*
had
besides
a
coach
and
four
usually
at
her
command
;
though
unhappily
,
*NL*
indeed
,
the
badness
of
the
neighbourhood
,
and
of
the
roads
,
made
this
*NL*
of
little
use
;
for
none
who
had
set
much
value
on
their
necks
would
*NL*
have
passed
through
the
one
,
or
who
had
set
any
value
on
their
hours
,
*NL*
would
have
visited
the
other
.
Now
to
deal
honestly
with
the
reader
,
*NL*
she
did
not
make
all
the
return
expected
to
so
much
indulgence
;
for
*NL*
she
had
been
married
against
her
will
by
a
fond
father
,
the
match
*NL*
having
been
rather
advantageous
on
her
side
;
for
the
squire
's
estate
*NL*
was
upward
of
L3000
a
year
,
and
her
fortune
no
more
than
a
bare
L8000
.
*NL*
Hence
perhaps
she
had
contracted
a
little
gloominess
of
temper
,
for
*NL*
she
was
rather
a
good
servant
than
a
good
wife
;
nor
had
she
always
the
*NL*
gratitude
to
return
the
extraordinary
degree
of
roaring
mirth
,
with
*NL*
which
the
squire
received
her
,
even
with
a
good-humoured
smile
.
She
*NL*
would
,
moreover
,
sometimes
interfere
with
matters
which
did
not
*NL*
concern
her
,
as
the
violent
drinking
of
her
husband
,
which
in
the
*NL*
gentlest
terms
she
would
take
some
of
the
few
opportunities
he
gave
*NL*
her
of
remonstrating
against
.
And
once
in
her
life
she
very
earnestly
*NL*
entreated
him
to
carry
her
for
two
months
to
London
,
which
he
*NL*
peremptorily
denied
;
nay
,
was
angry
with
his
wife
for
the
request
ever
*NL*
after
,
being
well
assured
that
all
the
husbands
in
London
are
*NL*
cuckolds
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
last
,
and
many
other
good
reasons
,
Western
at
length
heartily
*NL*
hated
his
wife
;
and
as
he
never
concealed
this
hatred
before
her
*NL*
death
,
so
he
never
forgot
it
afterwards
;
but
when
anything
in
the
*NL*
least
soured
him
,
as
a
bad
scenting
day
,
or
a
distemper
among
his
*NL*
hounds
,
or
any
other
such
misfortune
,
he
constantly
vented
his
spleen
*NL*
by
invectives
against
the
deceased
,
saying
,
``
If
my
wife
was
alive
now
,
*NL*
she
would
be
glad
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
invectives
he
was
especially
desirous
of
throwing
forth
before
*NL*
Sophia
;
for
as
he
loved
her
more
than
he
did
any
other
,
so
he
was
*NL*
really
jealous
that
she
had
loved
her
mother
better
than
him
.
And
this
*NL*
jealousy
Sophia
seldom
failed
of
heightening
on
these
occasions
;
for
*NL*
he
was
not
contented
with
violating
her
ears
with
the
abuse
of
her
*NL*
mother
,
but
endeavoured
to
force
an
explicit
approbation
of
all
this
*NL*
abuse
;
with
which
desire
he
never
could
prevail
upon
her
by
any
*NL*
promise
or
threats
to
comply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
some
of
my
readers
will
,
perhaps
,
wonder
that
the
squire
had
not
*NL*
hated
Sophia
as
much
as
he
had
hated
her
mother
;
but
I
must
inform
*NL*
them
,
that
hatred
is
not
the
effect
of
love
,
even
through
the
medium
*NL*
of
jealousy
.
It
is
,
indeed
,
very
possible
for
jealous
persons
to
kill
*NL*
the
objects
of
their
jealousy
,
but
not
to
hate
them
.
Which
sentiment
*NL*
being
a
pretty
hard
morsel
,
and
bearing
something
of
the
air
of
a
*NL*
paradox
,
we
shall
leave
the
reader
to
chew
the
cud
upon
it
to
the
end
*NL*
of
the
chapter
.

The
generous
behaviour
of
Sophia
towards
her
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
kept
silence
during
the
foregoing
speech
of
her
father
,
nor
did
*NL*
she
once
answer
otherwise
than
with
a
sigh
;
but
as
he
understood
none
*NL*
of
the
language
,
or
,
as
he
called
it
,
lingo
of
the
eyes
,
so
he
was
not
*NL*
satisfied
without
some
further
approbation
of
his
sentiments
,
which
he
*NL*
now
demanded
of
his
daughter
;
telling
her
,
in
the
usual
way
,
``
he
*NL*
expected
she
was
ready
to
take
the
part
of
everybody
against
him
,
as
*NL*
she
had
always
done
that
of
the
b
--
her
mother
.
''
Sophia
remaining
*NL*
still
silent
,
he
cryed
out
,
``
What

dost

speak

good
enough
to
speak

*NL*
``
For

Sophia

how
can
I
venture
to
speak

when
every

must
either
offend

dear
papa

convict
me
of
the
blackest

impiety

Sophia

returned
Western
;
``

will
take

part

You
wo
n't
confess
that
she

acted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon

cries
Sophia
,
``
I

belie

I
know

you

in
your
ways

I
have
heard
her
a
thousand
times
express
the
greatest

affection

I
am
convinced

so
far
from
her

are
very

the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
sir
,
''
cries
Sophia
.
``
I
do
not
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
n't
you
say
?
''
answered
the
father
:
``
you
have
the
impudence
to
*NL*
say
she
's
in
the
right
:
doth
it
not
follow
then
of
course
that
I
am
in
*NL*
the
wrong
?
And
perhaps
I
am
in
the
wrong
to
suffer
such
a
Presbyterian
*NL*
Hanoverian
b
--
to
come
into
my
house
.
She
may
`
dite
me
of
a
plot
for
*NL*
anything
I
know
,
and
give
my
estate
to
the
government
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
,
sir
,
from
injuring
you
or
your
estate
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
if
my
*NL*
aunt
had
died
yesterday
,
I
am
convinced
she
would
have
left
you
her
*NL*
whole
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Sophia
intended
it
or
no
,
I
shall
not
presume
to
assert
;
but
*NL*
certain
it
is
,
these
last
words
penetrated
very
deep
into
the
ears
of
*NL*
her
father
,
and
produced
a
much
more
sensible
effect
than
all
she
had
*NL*
said
before
.
He
received
the
sound
with
much
the
same
action
as
a
man
*NL*
receives
a
bullet
in
his
head
.
He
started
,
staggered
,
and
turned
pale
.
*NL*
After
which
he
remained
silent
above
a
minute
,
and
then
began
in
the
*NL*
following
hesitating
manner
:
``
Yesterday
!
she
would
have
left
me
her
*NL*
esteate
yesterday
!
would
she
?
Why
yesterday
,
of
all
the
days
in
the
*NL*
year
?
I
suppose
if
she
dies
to-morrow
,
she
will
leave
it
to
somebody
*NL*
else
,
and
perhaps
out
of
the
vamily
.
''
--
``
My
aunt
,
sir
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
*NL*
``
hath
very
violent
passions
,
and
I
ca
n't
answer
what
she
may
do
under
*NL*
their
influence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
!
''
returned
the
father
:
``
and
pray
who
hath
been
the
occasion
*NL*
of
putting
her
into
those
violent
passions
?
Nay
,
who
hath
actually
put
*NL*
her
into
them
?
Was
not
you
and
she
hard
at
it
before
I
came
into
the
*NL*
room
?
Besides
,
was
not
all
our
quarrel
about
you
?
I
have
not
*NL*
quarrelled
with
sister
this
many
years
but
upon
your
account
;
and
now
*NL*
you
would
throw
the
whole
blame
upon
me
,
as
thof
I
should
be
the
*NL*
occasion
of
her
leaving
the
esteate
out
o
'
the
vamily
.
I
could
have
*NL*
expected
no
better
indeed
;
this
is
like
the
return
you
make
to
all
the
*NL*
rest
of
my
fondness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beseech
you
then
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
``
upon
my
knees
I
beseech
you
,
if
I
*NL*
have
been
the
unhappy
occasion
of
this
difference
,
that
you
will
*NL*
endeavour
to
make
it
up
with
my
aunt
,
and
not
suffer
her
to
leave
your
*NL*
house
in
this
violent
rage
of
anger
:
she
is
a
very
good-natured
woman
,
*NL*
and
a
few
civil
words
will
satisfy
her
.
Let
me
entreat
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
must
go
and
ask
pardon
for
your
fault
,
must
I
?
''
answered
*NL*
Western
.
``
You
have
lost
the
hare
,
and
I
must
draw
every
way
to
find
*NL*
her
again
?
Indeed
,
if
I
was
certain
''
--
Here
he
stopt
,
and
Sophia
*NL*
throwing
in
more
entreaties
,
at
length
prevailed
upon
him
;
so
that
*NL*
after
venting
two
or
three
bitter
sarcastical
expressions
against
his
*NL*
daughter
,
he
departed
as
fast
as
he
could
to
recover
his
sister
,
*NL*
before
her
equipage
could
be
gotten
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
then
returned
to
her
chamber
of
mourning
,
where
she
indulged
*NL*
herself
-LRB-
if
the
phrase
may
be
allowed
me
-RRB-
in
all
the
luxury
of
tender
*NL*
grief
.
She
read
over
more
than
once
the
letter
which
she
had
received
*NL*
from
Jones
;
her
muff
too
was
used
on
this
occasion
;
and
she
bathed
*NL*
both
these
,
as
well
as
herself
,
with
her
tears
.
In
this
situation
the
*NL*
friendly
Mrs
Honour
exerted
her
utmost
abilities
to
comfort
her
*NL*
afflicted
mistress
.
She
ran
over
the
names
of
many
young
gentlemen
:
*NL*
and
having
greatly
commended
their
parts
and
persons
,
assured
Sophia
*NL*
that
she
might
take
her
choice
of
any
.
These
methods
must
have
*NL*
certainly
been
used
with
some
success
in
disorders
of
the
like
kind
,
*NL*
or
so
skilful
a
practitioner
as
Mrs
Honour
would
never
have
ventured
*NL*
to
apply
them
;
nay
,
I
have
heard
that
the
college
of
chambermaids
hold
*NL*
them
to
be
as
sovereign
remedies
as
any
in
the
female
dispensary
;
but
*NL*
whether
it
was
that
Sophia
's
disease
differed
inwardly
from
those
*NL*
cases
with
which
it
agreed
in
external
symptoms
,
I
will
not
assert
;
*NL*
but
,
in
fact
,
the
good
waiting-woman
did
more
harm
than
good
,
and
at
*NL*
last
so
incensed
her
mistress
-LRB-
which
was
no
easy
matter
-RRB-
that
with
an
*NL*
angry
voice
she
dismissed
her
from
her
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
great
variety
of
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
overtook
his
sister
just
as
she
was
stepping
into
the
*NL*
coach
,
and
partly
by
force
,
and
partly
by
solicitations
,
prevailed
*NL*
upon
her
to
order
her
horses
back
into
their
quarters
.
He
succeeded
in
*NL*
this
attempt
without
much
difficulty
;
for
the
lady
was
,
as
we
have
*NL*
already
hinted
,
of
a
most
placable
disposition
,
and
greatly
loved
her
*NL*
brother
,
though
she
despised
his
parts
,
or
rather
his
little
knowledge
*NL*
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Sophia
,
who
had
first
set
on
foot
this
reconciliation
,
was
now
*NL*
made
the
sacrifice
to
it
.
They
both
concurred
in
their
censures
on
her
*NL*
conduct
;
jointly
declared
war
against
her
,
and
directly
proceeded
to
*NL*
counsel
,
how
to
carry
it
on
in
the
most
vigorous
manner
.
For
this
*NL*
purpose
,
Mrs
Western
proposed
not
only
an
immediate
conclusion
of
the
*NL*
treaty
with
Allworthy
,
but
as
immediately
to
carry
it
into
execution
;
*NL*
saying
,
``
That
there
was
no
other
way
to
succeed
with
her
niece
,
but
by
*NL*
violent
methods
,
which
she
was
convinced
Sophia
had
not
sufficient
*NL*
resolution
to
resist
.
By
violent
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
mean
rather
,
hasty
*NL*
measures
;
for
as
to
confinement
or
absolute
force
,
no
such
things
must
*NL*
or
can
be
attempted
.
Our
plan
must
be
concerted
for
a
surprize
,
and
*NL*
not
for
a
storm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
matters
were
resolved
on
,
when
Mr
Blifil
came
to
pay
a
visit
to
*NL*
his
mistress
.
The
squire
no
sooner
heard
of
his
arrival
,
than
he
stept
*NL*
aside
,
by
his
sister
's
advice
,
to
give
his
daughter
orders
for
the
*NL*
proper
reception
of
her
lover
:
which
he
did
with
the
most
bitter
*NL*
execrations
and
denunciations
of
judgment
on
her
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
impetuosity
of
the
squire
bore
down
all
before
him
;
and
Sophia
,
as
*NL*
her
aunt
very
wisely
foresaw
,
was
not
able
to
resist
him
.
She
agreed
,
*NL*
therefore
,
to
see
Blifil
,
though
she
had
scarce
spirits
or
strength
*NL*
sufficient
to
utter
her
assent
.
Indeed
,
to
give
a
peremptory
denial
to
*NL*
a
father
whom
she
so
tenderly
loved
,
was
no
easy
task
.
Had
this
*NL*
circumstance
been
out
of
the
case
,
much
less
resolution
than
what
she
*NL*
was
really
mistress
of
,
would
,
perhaps
,
have
served
her
;
but
it
is
no
*NL*
unusual
thing
to
ascribe
those
actions
entirely
to
fear
,
which
are
in
*NL*
a
great
measure
produced
by
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
pursuance
,
therefore
,
of
her
father
's
peremptory
command
,
Sophia
*NL*
now
admitted
Mr
Blifil
's
visit
.
Scenes
like
this
,
when
painted
at
*NL*
large
,
afford
,
as
we
have
observed
,
very
little
entertainment
to
the
*NL*
reader
.
Here
,
therefore
,
we
shall
strictly
adhere
to
a
rule
of
Horace
;
*NL*
by
which
writers
are
directed
to
pass
over
all
those
matters
which
*NL*
they
despair
of
placing
in
a
shining
light
;
--
a
rule
,
we
conceive
,
of
*NL*
excellent
use
as
well
to
the
historian
as
to
the
poet
;
and
which
,
if
*NL*
followed
,
must
at
least
have
this
good
effect
,
that
many
a
great
evil
*NL*
-LRB-
for
so
all
great
books
are
called
-RRB-
would
thus
be
reduced
to
a
small
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
possible
the
great
art
used
by
Blifil
at
this
interview
would
*NL*
have
prevailed
on
Sophia
to
have
made
another
man
in
his
circumstances
*NL*
her
confident
,
and
to
have
revealed
the
whole
secret
of
her
heart
to
*NL*
him
;
but
she
had
contracted
so
ill
an
opinion
of
this
young
gentleman
,
*NL*
that
she
was
resolved
to
place
no
confidence
in
him
;
for
simplicity
,
*NL*
when
set
on
its
guard
,
is
often
a
match
for
cunning
.
Her
behaviour
to
*NL*
him
,
therefore
,
was
entirely
forced
,
and
indeed
such
as
is
generally
*NL*
prescribed
to
virgins
upon
the
second
formal
visit
from
one
who
is
*NL*
appointed
for
their
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
Blifil
declared
himself
to
the
squire
perfectly
satisfied
*NL*
with
his
reception
;
yet
that
gentleman
,
who
,
in
company
with
his
*NL*
sister
,
had
overheard
all
,
was
not
so
well
pleased
.
He
resolved
,
in
*NL*
pursuance
of
the
advice
of
the
sage
lady
,
to
push
matters
as
forward
*NL*
as
possible
;
and
addressing
himself
to
his
intended
son-in-law
in
the
*NL*
hunting
phrase
,
he
cried
,
after
a
loud
holla
,
``
Follow
her
,
boy
,
follow
*NL*
her
;
run
in
,
run
in
;
that
's
it
,
honeys
.
Dead
,
dead
,
dead
.
Never
be
*NL*
bashful
,
nor
stand
shall
I
,
shall
I
?
Allworthy
and
I
can
finish
all
*NL*
matters
between
us
this
afternoon
,
and
let
us
ha
'
the
wedding
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
having
conveyed
the
utmost
satisfaction
into
his
countenance
,
*NL*
answered
,
``
As
there
is
nothing
,
sir
,
in
this
world
which
I
so
eagerly
*NL*
desire
as
an
alliance
with
your
family
,
except
my
union
with
the
most
*NL*
amiable
and
deserving
Sophia
,
you
may
easily
imagine
how
impatient
I
*NL*
must
be
to
see
myself
in
possession
of
my
two
highest
wishes
.
If
I
*NL*
have
not
therefore
importuned
you
on
this
head
,
you
will
impute
it
*NL*
only
to
my
fear
of
offending
the
lady
,
by
endeavouring
to
hurry
on
so
*NL*
blessed
an
event
faster
than
a
strict
compliance
with
all
the
rules
of
*NL*
decency
and
decorum
will
permit
.
But
if
,
by
your
interest
,
sir
,
she
*NL*
might
be
induced
to
dispense
with
any
formalities
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Formalities
!
with
a
pox
!
''
answered
the
squire
.
``
Pooh
,
all
stuff
and
*NL*
nonsense
!
I
tell
thee
,
she
shall
ha
'
thee
to-morrow
:
you
will
know
the
*NL*
world
better
hereafter
,
when
you
come
to
my
age
.
Women
never
gi
'
their
*NL*
consent
,
man
,
if
they
can
help
it
,
't
is
not
the
fashion
.
If
I
had
*NL*
stayed
for
her
mother
's
consent
,
I
might
have
been
a
batchelor
to
this
*NL*
day
.
--
To
her
,
to
her
,
co
to
her
,
that
's
it
,
you
jolly
dog
.
I
tell
thee
*NL*
shat
ha
'
her
to-morrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
suffered
himself
to
be
overpowered
by
the
forcible
rhetoric
of
*NL*
the
squire
;
and
it
being
agreed
that
Western
should
close
with
*NL*
Allworthy
that
very
afternoon
,
the
lover
departed
home
,
having
first
*NL*
earnestly
begged
that
no
violence
might
be
offered
to
the
lady
by
this
*NL*
haste
,
in
the
same
manner
as
a
popish
inquisitor
begs
the
lay
power
to
*NL*
do
no
violence
to
the
heretic
delivered
over
to
it
,
and
against
whom
*NL*
the
church
hath
passed
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
to
say
the
truth
,
Blifil
had
passed
sentence
against
Sophia
;
for
,
*NL*
however
pleased
he
had
declared
himself
to
Western
with
his
reception
,
*NL*
he
was
by
no
means
satisfied
,
unless
it
was
that
he
was
convinced
of
*NL*
the
hatred
and
scorn
of
his
mistress
:
and
this
had
produced
no
less
*NL*
reciprocal
hatred
and
scorn
in
him
.
It
may
,
perhaps
,
be
asked
,
Why
*NL*
then
did
he
not
put
an
immediate
end
to
all
further
courtship
?
I
*NL*
answer
,
for
that
very
reason
,
as
well
as
for
several
others
equally
*NL*
good
,
which
we
shall
now
proceed
to
open
to
the
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Mr
Blifil
was
not
of
the
complexion
of
Jones
,
nor
ready
to
eat
*NL*
every
woman
he
saw
;
yet
he
was
far
from
being
destitute
of
that
*NL*
appetite
which
is
said
to
be
the
common
property
of
all
animals
.
With
*NL*
this
,
he
had
likewise
that
distinguishing
taste
,
which
serves
to
*NL*
direct
men
in
their
choice
of
the
object
or
food
of
their
several
*NL*
appetites
;
and
this
taught
him
to
consider
Sophia
as
a
most
delicious
*NL*
morsel
,
indeed
to
regard
her
with
the
same
desires
which
an
ortolan
*NL*
inspires
into
the
soul
of
an
epicure
.
Now
the
agonies
which
affected
*NL*
the
mind
of
Sophia
,
rather
augmented
than
impaired
her
beauty
;
for
her
*NL*
tears
added
brightness
to
her
eyes
,
and
her
breasts
rose
higher
with
*NL*
her
sighs
.
Indeed
,
no
one
hath
seen
beauty
in
its
highest
lustre
who
*NL*
hath
never
seen
it
in
distress
.
Blifil
therefore
looked
on
this
human
*NL*
ortolan
with
greater
desire
than
when
he
viewed
her
last
;
nor
was
his
*NL*
desire
at
all
lessened
by
the
aversion
which
he
discovered
in
her
to
*NL*
himself
.
On
the
contrary
,
this
served
rather
to
heighten
the
pleasure
*NL*
he
proposed
in
rifling
her
charms
,
as
it
added
triumph
to
lust
;
nay
,
*NL*
he
had
some
further
views
,
from
obtaining
the
absolute
possession
of
*NL*
her
person
,
which
we
detest
too
much
even
to
mention
;
and
revenge
*NL*
itself
was
not
without
its
share
in
the
gratifications
which
he
*NL*
promised
himself
.
The
rivalling
poor
Jones
,
and
supplanting
him
in
her
*NL*
affections
,
added
another
spur
to
his
pursuit
,
and
promised
another
*NL*
additional
rapture
to
his
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
all
these
views
,
which
to
some
scrupulous
persons
may
seem
to
*NL*
savour
too
much
of
malevolence
,
he
had
one
prospect
,
which
few
readers
*NL*
will
regard
with
any
great
abhorrence
.
And
this
was
the
estate
of
Mr
*NL*
Western
;
which
was
all
to
be
settled
on
his
daughter
and
her
issue
;
*NL*
for
so
extravagant
was
the
affection
of
that
fond
parent
,
that
,
*NL*
provided
his
child
would
but
consent
to
be
miserable
with
the
husband
*NL*
he
chose
,
he
cared
not
at
what
price
he
purchased
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
these
reasons
Mr
Blifil
was
so
desirous
of
the
match
that
he
*NL*
intended
to
deceive
Sophia
,
by
pretending
love
to
her
;
and
to
deceive
*NL*
her
father
and
his
own
uncle
,
by
pretending
he
was
beloved
by
her
.
In
*NL*
doing
this
he
availed
himself
of
the
piety
of
Thwackum
,
who
held
,
that
*NL*
if
the
end
proposed
was
religious
-LRB-
as
surely
matrimony
is
-RRB-
,
it
*NL*
mattered
not
how
wicked
were
the
means
.
As
to
other
occasions
,
he
used
*NL*
to
apply
the
philosophy
of
Square
,
which
taught
,
that
the
end
was
*NL*
immaterial
,
so
that
the
means
were
fair
and
consistent
with
moral
*NL*
rectitude
.
To
say
truth
,
there
were
few
occurrences
in
life
on
which
*NL*
he
could
not
draw
advantage
from
the
precepts
of
one
or
other
of
those
*NL*
great
masters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
deceit
was
indeed
necessary
to
be
practised
on
Mr
Western
;
who
*NL*
thought
the
inclinations
of
his
daughter
of
as
little
consequence
as
*NL*
Blifil
himself
conceived
them
to
be
;
but
as
the
sentiments
of
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
were
of
a
very
different
kind
,
so
it
was
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
to
impose
on
him
.
In
this
,
however
,
Blifil
was
so
well
*NL*
assisted
by
Western
,
that
he
succeeded
without
difficulty
;
for
as
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
had
been
assured
by
her
father
that
Sophia
had
a
proper
*NL*
affection
for
Blifil
,
and
that
all
which
he
had
suspected
concerning
*NL*
Jones
was
entirely
false
,
Blifil
had
nothing
more
to
do
than
to
*NL*
confirm
these
assertions
;
which
he
did
with
such
equivocations
,
that
*NL*
he
preserved
a
salvo
for
his
conscience
;
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
conveying
a
lie
to
his
uncle
,
without
the
guilt
of
telling
one
.
When
*NL*
he
was
examined
touching
the
inclinations
of
Sophia
by
Allworthy
,
who
*NL*
said
,
``
He
would
on
no
account
be
accessary
to
forcing
a
young
lady
*NL*
into
a
marriage
contrary
to
her
own
will
;
''
he
answered
,
``
That
the
real
*NL*
sentiments
of
young
ladies
were
very
difficult
to
be
understood
;
that
*NL*
her
behaviour
to
him
was
full
as
forward
as
he
wished
it
,
and
that
if
*NL*
he
could
believe
her
father
,
she
had
all
the
affection
for
him
which
*NL*
any
lover
could
desire
.
As
for
Jones
,
''
said
he
,
``
whom
I
am
loth
to
*NL*
call
villain
,
though
his
behaviour
to
you
,
sir
,
sufficiently
justifies
*NL*
the
appellation
,
his
own
vanity
,
or
perhaps
some
wicked
views
,
might
*NL*
make
him
boast
of
a
falsehood
;
for
if
there
had
been
any
reality
in
*NL*
Miss
Western
's
love
to
him
,
the
greatness
of
her
fortune
would
never
*NL*
have
suffered
him
to
desert
her
,
as
you
are
well
informed
he
hath
.
*NL*
Lastly
,
sir
,
I
promise
you
I
would
not
myself
,
for
any
consideration
,
*NL*
no
,
not
for
the
whole
world
,
consent
to
marry
this
young
lady
,
if
I
*NL*
was
not
persuaded
she
had
all
the
passion
for
me
which
I
desire
she
*NL*
should
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
excellent
method
of
conveying
a
falsehood
with
the
heart
only
,
*NL*
without
making
the
tongue
guilty
of
an
untruth
,
by
the
means
of
*NL*
equivocation
and
imposture
,
hath
quieted
the
conscience
of
many
a
*NL*
notable
deceiver
;
and
yet
,
when
we
consider
that
it
is
Omniscience
on
*NL*
which
these
endeavour
to
impose
,
it
may
possibly
seem
capable
of
*NL*
affording
only
a
very
superficial
comfort
;
and
that
this
artful
and
*NL*
refined
distinction
between
communicating
a
lie
,
and
telling
one
,
is
*NL*
hardly
worth
the
pains
it
costs
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
was
pretty
well
satisfied
with
what
Mr
Western
and
Mr
Blifil
*NL*
told
him
:
and
the
treaty
was
now
,
at
the
end
of
two
days
,
concluded
.
*NL*
Nothing
then
remained
previous
to
the
office
of
the
priest
,
but
the
*NL*
office
of
the
lawyers
,
which
threatened
to
take
up
so
much
time
,
that
*NL*
Western
offered
to
bind
himself
by
all
manner
of
covenants
,
rather
*NL*
than
defer
the
happiness
of
the
young
couple
.
Indeed
,
he
was
so
very
*NL*
earnest
and
pressing
,
that
an
indifferent
person
might
have
concluded
*NL*
he
was
more
a
principal
in
this
match
than
he
really
was
;
but
this
*NL*
eagerness
was
natural
to
him
on
all
occasions
:
and
he
conducted
every
*NL*
scheme
he
undertook
in
such
a
manner
,
as
if
the
success
of
that
alone
*NL*
was
sufficient
to
constitute
the
whole
happiness
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
joint
importunities
of
both
father
and
son-in-law
would
probably
*NL*
have
prevailed
on
Mr
Allworthy
,
who
brooked
but
ill
any
delay
of
*NL*
giving
happiness
to
others
,
had
not
Sophia
herself
prevented
it
,
and
*NL*
taken
measures
to
put
a
final
end
to
the
whole
treaty
,
and
to
rob
both
*NL*
church
and
law
of
those
taxes
which
these
wise
bodies
have
thought
*NL*
proper
to
receive
from
the
propagation
of
the
human
species
in
a
*NL*
lawful
manner
.

*NL*
*NL*
A
strange
resolution
of
Sophia
,
and
a
more
strange
stratagem
of
Mrs
*NL*
Honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Mrs
Honour
was
principally
attached
to
her
own
interest
,
she
*NL*
was
not
without
some
little
attachment
to
Sophia
.
To
say
truth
,
it
was
*NL*
very
difficult
for
any
one
to
know
that
young
lady
without
loving
her
.
*NL*
She
no
sooner
therefore
heard
a
piece
of
news
,
which
she
imagined
to
*NL*
be
of
great
importance
to
her
mistress
,
than
,
quite
forgetting
the
*NL*
anger
which
she
had
conceived
two
days
before
,
at
her
unpleasant
*NL*
dismission
from
Sophia
's
presence
,
she
ran
hastily
to
inform
her
of
*NL*
the
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
beginning
of
her
discourse
was
as
abrupt
as
her
entrance
into
the
*NL*
room
.
``
O
dear
ma'am
!
''
says
she
,
``
what
doth
your
la
`
ship
think
?
To
be
*NL*
sure
I
am
frightened
out
of
my
wits
;
and
yet
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
*NL*
tell
your
la
`
ship
,
though
perhaps
it
may
make
you
angry
,
for
we
*NL*
servants
do
n't
always
know
what
will
make
our
ladies
angry
;
for
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
everything
is
always
laid
to
the
charge
of
a
servant
.
When
our
*NL*
ladies
are
out
of
humour
,
to
be
sure
we
must
be
scolded
;
and
to
be
*NL*
sure
I
should
not
wonder
if
your
la
`
ship
should
be
out
of
humour
;
nay
,
*NL*
it
must
surprize
you
certainly
,
ay
,
and
shock
you
too
.
''
--
``
Good
Honour
,
*NL*
let
me
know
it
without
any
longer
preface
,
''
says
Sophia
;
``
there
are
*NL*
few
things
,
I
promise
you
,
which
will
surprize
,
and
fewer
which
will
*NL*
shock
me
.
''
--
``
Dear
ma'am
,
''
answered
Honour
,
``
to
be
sure
,
I
overheard
my
*NL*
master
talking
to
parson
Supple
about
getting
a
licence
this
very
*NL*
afternoon
;
and
to
be
sure
I
heard
him
say
,
your
la
`
ship
should
be
*NL*
married
to-morrow
morning
.
''
Sophia
turned
pale
at
these
words
,
and
*NL*
repeated
eagerly
,
``
To-morrow
morning
!
''
--
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
trusty
waiting-woman
,
``
I
will
take
my
oath
I
heard
my
master
say
*NL*
so
.
''
--
``
Honour
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
you
have
both
surprized
and
shocked
me
*NL*
to
such
a
degree
that
I
have
scarce
any
breath
or
spirits
left
.
What
*NL*
is
to
be
done
in
my
dreadful
situation
?
''
--
``
I
wish
I
was
able
to
advise
*NL*
your
la
`
ship
,
''
says
she
.
``
Do
advise
me
,
''
cries
Sophia
;
``
pray
,
dear
*NL*
Honour
,
advise
me
.
Think
what
you
would
attempt
if
it
was
your
own
*NL*
case
.

--
``
Indeed
,
ma'am
,
''
cries
Honour
,
``
I
wish
your
la
`
ship

I
*NL*
could
change
situations
;
that
is
,
I
mean
without
hurting
your
la
`
ship
;
*NL*
for
to
be
sure
I
do
n't
wish
you
so
bad
as
to
be
a
servant
;
but
because
*NL*
that
if
so
be
it
was
my
case
,
I
should
find
no
manner
of
difficulty
in
*NL*
it
;
for
,
in
my
poor
opinion
,
young
Squire
Blifil
is
a
charming
,
sweet
,
*NL*
handsome
man
.
''
--
``
Do
n't
mention
such
stuff
,
''
cries
Sophia
.
``
Such
*NL*
stuff
!
''
repeated
Honour
;
``
why
,
there
.
Well
,
to
be
sure
,
what
's
one
*NL*
man
's
meat
is
another

's
poison

and
the
same
is
altogether
as
true
*NL*
of
women

--
``
Honour
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
rather
than
submit
to
be
the
wife
*NL*
of
that
contemptible
wretch

I
would
plunge
a
dagger
into
my
*NL*
heart

--
``
O

!
''
answered
the
other
,
``
I
am
sure
you
frighten
*NL*
me
out
of
my

Let
me
beseech
your

to
suffer
such
*NL*
wicked
thoughts
to
come
into
your

O

to
be

I
tremble
*NL*
every
inch
of
me

Dear

consider

that
to

denied
Christian

burial
,
and
to
have
your
corpse
buried
in
the
highway
,
and
a
stake
*NL*
drove
through
you

*NL*
be

his
ghost
hath
walked
there

several
people

have
seen
him

To
be
sure
it
can
be
nothing
but
the
devil
which
can
*NL*
put
such
wicked

certainly
it

so
I

heard
said

hath
such
a

violent
aversion

hates
the

so
very
bad

that
you

ca
n't
bear
to

going
into

there
may

be
such
antipathies

touch

*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
had
been
too
much
wrapt
in
contemplation
to
pay
any
great
*NL*
attention
to
the
foregoing
excellent
discourse
of
her
maid
;
*NL*
interrupting
her
therefore
,
without
making
any
answer

she
said
,
*NL*
``

That

There

Sophia

``
a

of
quality

several
months
with

during
all
which
time
she

treated

expressed
so
much
pleasure

she
earnestly
desired

I
would
not

``
You
are
mistaken

Honour

says
Sophia

``
she
looks
*NL*
upon
the
authority
of
a

a
much
lower
light
than
I
do
;

she
pressed
me
violently
to
go

when
I
refused

go
without

she
laughed
me
to
scorn

called
me

silly
country

said

I
should
make
a
pure
loving
wife

*NL*
I

dutiful

So
I
have
no

both

protect
me
too

my

,
finding

out
of

be
brought

some

``
Well

how

Robin
will
be
hanged
before

of

without
my

*NL*
orders

''
``
I
intend
to
escape
,
''
said
Sophia
,
``
by
walking
out
of
the
*NL*
doors
when
they
are
open
.
I
thank
Heaven
my
legs
are
very
able
to
*NL*
carry
me
.
They
have
supported
me
many
a
long
evening
''
--
``
Yes
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
''
cries
Honour
,
``
I
will
follow
your
la
`
ship
through
the
world
;
*NL*
but
your

`
ship
had
almost
as
good
be
alone
:
for
I
should
not
be
able
*NL*
to
defend
you
,
if
any
robbers
,
or
other
villains
,
should
meet
with
*NL*
you

Nay
,
I
should
be
in
as
horrible
a
fright
as
your

;
for
to
*NL*
be
certain
,
they
would
ravish
us
both

Besides
,
ma'am

consider
how
*NL*
cold
the
nights
are
now
;
we
shall
be
frozen

''
--
``
A
good
brisk
*NL*
pace
,
''
answered
Sophia
,
``
will
preserve
us
from
the
cold
;
and
if
you
*NL*
can
not
defend
me
from
a
villain

I
will
defend
you
;
for
I
will
*NL*
take
a
pistol
with
me

There
are
two
always
charged
in
the
*NL*
hall
.
''
--
``
Dear
ma'am
,
you
frighten
me
more
and
more
,
''
cries
Honour
:
*NL*
``
sure
your
la
`
ship
would
not
venture
to
fire
it
off
!
I
had
rather
run
*NL*
any
chance
than
your
la
`
ship
should
do
that
.
''
--
``
Why
so
?
''
says
Sophia
,
*NL*
smiling
;
``
would
not
you
,
Honour
,
fire
a
pistol
at
any
one
who
should
*NL*
attack
your
virtue
?
''
--
``
To
be
sure
,
ma'am
,
''
cries
Honour
,
``
one
's
virtue
*NL*
is
a
dear
thing
,
especially
to
us
poor
servants
;
for
it
is
our
*NL*
livelihood
,
as
a
body
may
say
:
yet
I
mortally
hate
fire-arms
;
for
so
*NL*
many
accidents
happen
by
them
.
''
--
``
Well
,
well
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
I
believe
*NL*
I
may
ensure
your
virtue
at
a
very
cheap
rate
,
without
carrying
any
*NL*
arms
with
us
;
for
I
intend
to
take
horses
at
the
very
first
town
we
*NL*
come
to
,
and
we
shall
hardly
be
attacked
in
our
way
thither
.
Look
`
ee
,
*NL*
Honour
,
I
am
resolved
to
go
;
and
if
you
will
attend
me
,
I
promise
you
*NL*
I
will
reward
you
to
the
very
utmost
of
my
power
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
argument
had
a
stronger
effect
on
Honour
than
all
the
*NL*
preceding
.
And
since
she
saw
her
mistress
so
determined
,
she
desisted
*NL*
from
any
further
dissuasions
.
They
then
entered
into
a
debate
on
ways
*NL*
and
means
of
executing
their
project
.
Here
a
very
stubborn
difficulty
*NL*
occurred
,
and
this
was
the
removal
of
their
effects
,
which
was
much
*NL*
more
easily
got
over
by
the
mistress
than
by
the
maid
;
for
when
a
lady
*NL*
hath
once
taken
a
resolution
to
run
to
a
lover
,
or
to
run
from
him
,
*NL*
all
obstacles
are
considered
as
trifles
.
But
Honour
was
inspired
by
no
*NL*
such
motive
;
she
had
no
raptures
to
expect
,
nor
any
terrors
to
shun
;
*NL*
and
besides
the
real
value
of
her
clothes
,
in
which
consisted
a
great
*NL*
part
of
her
fortune
,
she
had
a
capricious
fondness
for
several
gowns
,
*NL*
and
other
things
;
either
because
they
became
her
,
or
because
they
were
*NL*
given
her
by
such
a
particular
person
;
because
she
had
bought
them
*NL*
lately
,
or
because
she
had
had
them
long
;
or
for
some
other
reasons
*NL*
equally
good
;
so
that
she
could
not
endure
the
thoughts
of
leaving
the
*NL*
poor
things
behind
her
exposed
to
the
mercy
of
Western
,
who
,
she
*NL*
doubted
not
,
would
in
his
rage
make
them
suffer
martyrdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ingenious
Mrs
Honour
having
applied
all
her
oratory
to
dissuade
*NL*
her
mistress
from
her
purpose
,
when
she
found
her
positively
*NL*
determined
,
at
last
started
the
following
expedient
to
remove
her
*NL*
clothes
,
viz.
,
to
get
herself
turned
out
of
doors
that
very
evening
.
*NL*
Sophia
highly
approved
this
method
,
but
doubted
how
it
might
be
*NL*
brought
about
.
``
O
,
ma'am
,
''
cries
Honour
,
``
your
la
`
ship
may
trust
that
*NL*
to
me
;
we
servants
very
well
know
how
to
obtain
this
favour
of
our
*NL*
masters
and
mistresses
;
though
sometimes
,
indeed
,
where
they
owe
us
*NL*
more
wages
than
they
can
readily
pay
,
they
will
put
up
with
all
our
*NL*
affronts
,
and
will
hardly
take
any
warning
we
can
give
them
;
but
the
*NL*
squire
is
none
of
those
;
and
since
your
la
`
ship
is
resolved
upon
*NL*
setting
out
to-night
,
I
warrant
I
get
discharged
this
afternoon
.
''
It
*NL*
was
then
resolved
that
she
should
pack
up
some
linen
and
a
night-gown
*NL*
for
Sophia
,
with
her
own
things
;
and
as
for
all
her
other
clothes
,
the
*NL*
young
lady
abandoned
them
with
no
more
remorse
than
the
sailor
feels
*NL*
when
he
throws
over
the
goods
of
others
,
in
order
to
save
his
own
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
viii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
scenes
of
altercation
,
of
no
very
uncommon
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
had
scarce
sooner
parted
from
her
young
lady
,
than
*NL*
something
-LRB-
for
I
would
not
,
like
the
old
woman
in
Quevedo
,
injure
the
*NL*
devil
by
any
false
accusation
,
and
possibly
he
might
have
no
hand
in
*NL*
it
-RRB-
--
but
something
,
I
say
,
suggested
itself
to
her
,
that
by
*NL*
sacrificing
Sophia
and
all
her
secrets
to
Mr
Western
,
she
might
*NL*
probably
make
her
fortune
.
Many
considerations
urged
this
discovery
.
*NL*
The
fair
prospect
of
a
handsome
reward
for
so
great
and
acceptable
a
*NL*
service
to
the
squire
,
tempted
her
avarice
;
and
again
,
the
danger
of
*NL*
the
enterprize
she
had
undertaken
;
the
uncertainty
of
its
success
;
*NL*
night
,
cold
,
robbers
,
ravishers
,
all
alarmed
her
fears
.
So
forcibly
*NL*
did
all
these
operate
upon
her
,
that
she
was
almost
determined
to
go
*NL*
directly
to
the
squire
,
and
to
lay
open
the
whole
affair
.
She
was
,
*NL*
however
,
too
upright
a
judge
to
decree
on
one
side
,
before
she
had
*NL*
heard
the
other
.
And
here
,
first
,
a
journey
to
London
appeared
very
*NL*
strongly
in
support
of
Sophia
.
She
eagerly
longed
to
see
a
place
in
*NL*
which
she
fancied
charms
short
only
of
those
which
a
raptured
saint
*NL*
imagines
in
heaven
.
In
the
next
place
,
as
she
knew
Sophia
to
have
much
*NL*
more
generosity
than
her
master
,
so
her
fidelity
promised
her
a
*NL*
greater
reward
than
she
could
gain
by
treachery
.
She
then
*NL*
cross-examined
all
the
articles
which
had
raised
her
fears
on
the
*NL*
other
side
,
and
found
,
on
fairly
sifting
the
matter
,
that
there
was
*NL*
very
little
in
them
.
And
now
both
scales
being
reduced
to
a
pretty
*NL*
even
balance
,
her
love
to
her
mistress
being
thrown
into
the
scale
of
*NL*
her
integrity
,
made
that
rather
preponderate
,
when
a
circumstance
*NL*
struck
upon
her
imagination
which
might
have
had
a
dangerous
effect
,
*NL*
had
its
whole
weight
been
fairly
put
into
the
other
scale
.
This
was
*NL*
the
length
of
time
which
must
intervene
before
Sophia
would
be
able
to
*NL*
fulfil
her
promises
;
for
though
she
was
intitled
to
her
mother
's
*NL*
fortune
at
the
death
of
her
father
,
and
to
the
sum
of
L3000
left
her
*NL*
by
an
uncle
when
she
came
of
age
;
yet
these
were
distant
days
,
and
*NL*
many
accidents
might
prevent
the
intended
generosity
of
the
young
*NL*
lady
;
whereas
the
rewards
she
might
expect
from
Mr
Western
were
*NL*
immediate
.
But
while
she
was
pursuing
this
thought
the
good
genius
of
*NL*
Sophia
,
or
that
which
presided
over
the
integrity
of
Mrs
Honour
,
or
*NL*
perhaps
mere
chance
,
sent
an
accident
in
her
way
,
which
at
once
*NL*
preserved
her
fidelity
,
and
even
facilitated
the
intended
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
's
maid
claimed
great
superiority
over
Mrs
Honour
on
*NL*
several
accounts
.
First
,
her
birth
was
higher
;
for
her
great-grandmother
*NL*
by
the
mother
's
side
was
a
cousin
,
not
far
removed
,
to
an
Irish
peer
.
*NL*
Secondly
,
her
wages
were
greater
.
And
lastly
,
she
had
been
at
London
,
*NL*
and
had
of
consequence
seen
more
of
the
world
.
She
had
always
behaved
,
*NL*
therefore
,
to
Mrs
Honour
with
that
reserve
,
and
had
always
exacted
of
*NL*
her
those
marks
of
distinction
,
which
every
order
of
females
preserves
*NL*
and
requires
in
conversation
with
those
of
an
inferior
order
.
Now
as
*NL*
Honour
did
not
at
all
times
agree
with
this
doctrine
,
but
would
*NL*
frequently
break
in
upon
the
respect
which
the
other
demanded
,
Mrs
*NL*
Western
's
maid
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
her
company
;
indeed
,
she
*NL*
earnestly
longed
to
return
home
to
the
house
of
her
mistress
,
where
*NL*
she
domineered
at
will
over
all
the
other
servants
.
She
had
been
*NL*
greatly
,
therefore
,
disappointed
in
the
morning
,
when
Mrs
Western
had
*NL*
changed
her
mind
on
the
very
point
of
departure
;
and
had
been
in
what
*NL*
is
vulgarly
called
a
glouting
humour
ever
since
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
humour
,
which
was
none
of
the
sweetest
,
she
came
into
the
room
*NL*
where
Honour
was
debating
with
herself
in
the
manner
we
have
above
*NL*
related
.
Honour
no
sooner
saw
her
,
than
she
addressed
her
in
the
*NL*
following
obliging
phrase
:
``
Soh
,
madam
,
I
find
we
are
to
have
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
your
company
longer
,
which
I
was
afraid
the
quarrel
*NL*
between
my
master
and
your
lady
would
have
robbed
us
of
.
''
--
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
,
madam
,
''
answered
the
other
,
``
what
you
mean
by
we
and
us
.
I
*NL*
assure
you
I
do
not
look
on
any
of
the
servants
in
this
house
to
be
*NL*
proper
company
for
me
.
I
am
company
,
I
hope
,
for
their
betters
every
*NL*
day
in
the
week
.
I
do
not
speak
on
your
account
,
Mrs
Honour
;
for
you
*NL*
are
a
civilized
young
woman
;
and
when
you
have
seen
a
little
more
of
*NL*
the
world
,
I
should
not
be
ashamed
to
walk
with
you
in
St
James
's
*NL*
Park
.
''
--
``
Hoity
toity
!
''
cries
Honour
,
``
madam
is
in
her
airs
,
I
protest
.
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
,
forsooth
!
sure
,
madam
,
you
might
call
me
by
my
sir-name
;
*NL*
for
though
my
lady
calls
me
Honour
,
I
have
a
sir-name
as
well
as
other
*NL*
folks
.
Ashamed
to
walk
with
me
,
quotha
!
marry
,
as
good
as
yourself
,
I
*NL*
hope
.
''
--
``
Since
you
make
such
a
return
to
my
civility
,
''
said
the
other
,
*NL*
``
I
must
acquaint
you
,
Mrs
Honour
,
that
you
are
not
so
good
as
me
.
In
*NL*
the
country
,
indeed
,
one
is
obliged
to
take
up
with
all
kind
of
*NL*
trumpery
;
but
in
town
I
visit
none
but
the
women
of
women
of
quality
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
Mrs
Honour
,
there
is
some
difference
,
I
hope
,
between
you
and
*NL*
me
.
''
--
``
I
hope
so
too
,
''
answered
Honour
:
``
there
is
some
difference
in
*NL*
our
ages
,
and
--
I
think
in
our
persons
.
''
Upon
speaking
which
last
*NL*
words
,
she
strutted
by
Mrs
Western
's
maid
with
the
most
provoking
air
*NL*
of
contempt
;
turning
up
her
nose
,
tossing
her
head
,
and
violently
*NL*
brushing
the
hoop
of
her
competitor
with
her
own
.
The
other
lady
put
*NL*
on
one
of
her
most
malicious
sneers
,
and
said
,
``
Creature
!
you
are
*NL*
below
my
anger
;
and
it
is
beneath
me
to
give
ill
words
to
such
an
*NL*
audacious
saucy
trollop
;
but
,
hussy
,
I
must
tell
you
,
your
breeding
*NL*
shows
the
meanness
of
your
birth
as
well
as
of
your
education
;
and
*NL*
both
very
properly
qualify
you
to
be
the
mean
serving-woman
of
a
*NL*
country
girl
.
''
--
``
Do
n't
abuse
my
lady
,
''
cries
Honour
:
``
I
wo
n't
take
*NL*
that
of
you
;
she
's
as
much
better
than
yours
as
she
is
younger
,
and
*NL*
ten
thousand
times
more
handsomer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
ill
luck
,
or
rather
good
luck
,
sent
Mrs
Western
to
see
her
maid
*NL*
in
tears
,
which
began
to
flow
plentifully
at
her
approach
;
and
of
*NL*
which
being
asked
the
reason
by
her
mistress
,
she
presently
acquainted
*NL*
her
that
her
tears
were
occasioned
by
the
rude
treatment
of
that
*NL*
creature
there
--
meaning
Honour
.
``
And
,
madam
,
''
continued
she
,
``
I
could
*NL*
have
despised
all
she
said
to
me

but
she
hath
had
the
audacity
to

affront
your
ladyship
,
and
to
call
you
ugly

Yes

madam
,
she
called
*NL*
you
ugly
old
cat
to
my
face

I
could
not
bear
to
hear
your

*NL*
called
ugly

''
--
``
Why
do
you
repeat
her
impudence
so
often
?
''
said
Mrs
*NL*
Western
.
And
then
turning
to
Mrs
Honour
,
she
asked
her
``
How
she
had
*NL*
the
assurance
to
mention
her
name
with
disrespect
?
''
--
``
Disrespect
,
*NL*
madam
!
''
answered
Honour
;
``
I
never
mentioned
your

at
all
:
I
said
*NL*
somebody
was
not
as
handsome

to
be
sure
you
know
*NL*
that
as
well

``
Hussy

replied
the
lady

Mrs
Western
spoke
,
or
rather
thundered
,
in
answer
;
but
as
she
was
*NL*
hardly
articulate
,
we
can
not
be
very
certain
of
the
identical
words
;
*NL*
we
shall
therefore
omit
inserting
a
speech
which
at
best
would
not
*NL*
greatly
redound
to
her
honour
.
She
then
departed
in
search
of
her
*NL*
brother
,
with
a
countenance
so
full
of
rage
,
that
she
resembled
one
of
*NL*
the
furies
rather
than
a
human
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
chambermaids
being
again
left
alone
,
began
a
second
bout
at
*NL*
altercation
,
which
soon
produced
a
combat
of
a
more
active
kind
.
In
*NL*
this
the
victory
belonged
to
the
lady
of
inferior
rank
,
but
not
*NL*
without
some
loss
of
blood
,
of
hair
,
and
of

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
The
wise
demeanour
of
Mr
Western
in
the
character
of
a
magistrate
.
A
*NL*
hint
to
justices
of
peace
,
concerning
the
necessary
qualifications
of
*NL*
a
clerk
;
with
extraordinary
instances
of
paternal
madness
and
filial
*NL*
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Logicians
sometimes
prove
too
much
by
an
argument
,
and
politicians
*NL*
often
overreach
themselves
in
a
scheme
.
Thus
had
it
like
to
have
*NL*
happened
to
Mrs
Honour
,
who
,
instead
of
recovering
the
rest
of
her
*NL*
clothes
,
had
like
to
have
stopped
even
those
she
had
on
her
back
from
*NL*
escaping
;
for
the
squire
no
sooner
heard
of
her
having
abused
his
*NL*
sister
,
than
he
swore
twenty
oaths
he
would
send
her
to
Bridewell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
was
a
very
good-natured
woman
,
and
ordinarily
of
a
*NL*
forgiving
temper
.
She
had
lately
remitted
the
trespass
of
a
*NL*
stage-coachman
,
who
had
overturned
her
post-chaise
into
a
ditch
;
nay
,
*NL*
she
had
even
broken
the
law
,
in
refusing
to
prosecute
a
highwayman
who
*NL*
had
robbed
her
,
not
only
of
a
sum
of
money
,
but
of
her
ear-rings
;
at
*NL*
the
same
time
d
--
ning
her
,
and
saying
,
``
Such
handsome
b
--
s
as
you
*NL*
do
n't
want
jewels
to
set
them
off
,
and
be
d
--
n
'd
to
you
.
''
But
now
,
so
*NL*
uncertain
are
our
tempers
,
and
so
much
do
we
at
different
times
differ
*NL*
from
ourselves
,
she
would
hear
of
no
mitigation
;
nor
could
all
the
*NL*
affected
penitence
of
Honour
,
nor
all
the
entreaties
of
Sophia
for
her
*NL*
own
servant
,
prevail
with
her
to
desist
from
earnestly
desiring
her
*NL*
brother
to
execute
justiceship
-LRB-
for
it
was
indeed
a
syllable
more
than
*NL*
justice
-RRB-
on
the
wench
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
luckily
the
clerk
had
a
qualification
,
which
no
clerk
to
a
justice
*NL*
of
peace
ought
ever
to
be
without
,
namely
,
some
understanding
in
the
*NL*
law
of
this
realm
.
He
therefore
whispered
in
the
ear
of
the
justice
*NL*
that
he
would
exceed
his
authority
by
committing
the
girl
to
*NL*
Bridewell
,
as
there
had
been
no
attempt
to
break
the
peace
;
``
for
I
am
*NL*
afraid
,
sir
,
''
says
he
,
``
you
can
not
legally
commit
any
one
to
Bridewell
*NL*
only
for
ill-breeding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
matters
of
high
importance
,
particularly
in
cases
relating
to
the
*NL*
game
,
the
justice
was
not
always
attentive
to
these
admonitions
of
his
*NL*
clerk
;
for
,
indeed
,
in
executing
the
laws
under
that
head
,
many
*NL*
justices
of
peace
suppose
they
have
a
large
discretionary
power
,
by
*NL*
virtue
of
which
,
under
the
notion
of
searching
for
and
taking
away
*NL*
engines
for
the
destruction
of
the
game
,
they
often
commit
trespasses
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
felony
,
at
their
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
offence
was
not
of
quite
so
high
a
nature
,
nor
so
dangerous
*NL*
to
the
society
.
Here
,
therefore
,
the
justice
behaved
with
some
*NL*
attention
to
the
advice
of
his
clerk
;
for
,
in
fact
,
he
had
already
had
*NL*
two
informations
exhibited
against
him
in
the
King
's
Bench
,
and
had
no
*NL*
curiosity
to
try
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
,
therefore
,
putting
on
a
most
wise
and
significant
*NL*
countenance
,
after
a
preface
of
several
hums
and
hahs
,
told
his
*NL*
sister
,
that
upon
more
mature
deliberation
,
he
was
of
opinion
,
that
*NL*
``
as
there
was
no
breaking
up
of
the
peace
,
such
as
the
law
,
''
says
he
,
*NL*
``
calls
breaking
open
a
door
,
or
breaking
a
hedge
,
or
breaking
a
head
,
*NL*
or
any
such
sort
of
breaking
,
the
matter
did
not
amount
to
a
felonious
*NL*
kind
of
a
thing
,
nor
trespasses
,
nor
damages
,
and
,
therefore
,
there
*NL*
was
no
punishment
in
the
law
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
said
,
``
she
knew
the
law
much
better
;
that
she
had
known
*NL*
servants
very
severely
punished
for
affronting
their
masters
;
''
and
*NL*
then
named
a
certain
justice
of
the
peace
in
London
,
``
who
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
would
commit
a
servant
to
Bridewell
at
any
time
when
a
master
or
*NL*
mistress
desired
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
enough
,
''
cries
the
squire
;
``
it
may
be
so
in
London
;
but
the
law
*NL*
is
different
in
the
country
.
''
Here
followed
a
very
learned
dispute
*NL*
between
the
brother
and
sister
concerning
the
law
,
which
we
would
*NL*
insert
,
if
we
imagined
many
of
our
readers
could
understand
it
.
This
*NL*
was
,
however
,
at
length
referred
by
both
parties
to
the
clerk
,
who
*NL*
decided
it
in
favour
of
the
magistrate
;
and
Mrs
Western
was
,
in
the
*NL*
end
,
obliged
to
content
herself
with
the
satisfaction
of
having
Honour
*NL*
turned
away
;
to
which
Sophia
herself
very
readily
and
cheerfully
*NL*
consented
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Fortune
,
after
having
diverted
herself
,
according
to
custom
,
with
*NL*
two
or
three
frolicks
,
at
last
disposed
all
matters
to
the
advantage
*NL*
of
our
heroine
;
who
indeed
succeeded
admirably
well
in
her
deceit
,
*NL*
considering
it
was
the
first
she
had
ever
practised
.
And
,
to
say
the
*NL*
truth
,
I
have
often
concluded
,
that
the
honest
part
of
mankind
would
*NL*
be
much
too
hard
for
the
knavish
,
if
they
could
bring
themselves
to
*NL*
incur
the
guilt
,
or
thought
it
worth
their
while
to
take
the
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Honour
acted
her
part
to
the
utmost
perfection
.
She
no
sooner
saw
*NL*
herself
secure
from
all
danger
of
Bridewell
,
a
word
which
had
raised
*NL*
most
horrible
ideas
in
her
mind
,
than
she
resumed
those
airs
which
her
*NL*
terrors
before
had
a
little
abated
;
and
laid
down
her
place
,
with
as
*NL*
much
affectation
of
content
,
and
indeed
of
contempt
,
as
was
ever
*NL*
practised
at
the
resignation
of
places
of
much
greater
importance
.
If
*NL*
the
reader
pleases
,
therefore
,
we
chuse
rather
to
say
she
*NL*
resigned
--
which
hath
,
indeed
,
been
always
held
a
synonymous
expression
*NL*
with
being
turned
out
,
or
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
ordered
her
to
be
very
expeditious
in
packing
;
for
his
*NL*
sister
declared
she
would
not
sleep
another
night
under
the
same
roof
*NL*
with
so
impudent
a
slut
.
To
work
therefore
she
went
,
and
that
so
*NL*
earnestly
,
that
everything
was
ready
early
in
the
evening
;
when
,
*NL*
having
received
her
wages
,
away
packed
bag
and
baggage
,
to
the
great
*NL*
satisfaction
of
every
one
,
but
of
none
more
than
of
Sophia
;
who
,
*NL*
having
appointed
her
maid
to
meet
her
at
a
certain
place
not
far
from
*NL*
the
house
,
exactly
at
the
dreadful
and
ghostly
hour
of
twelve
,
began
*NL*
to
prepare
for
her
own
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
first
she
was
obliged
to
give
two
painful
audiences
,
the
one
to
*NL*
her
aunt
,
and
the
other
to
her
father
.
In
these
Mrs
Western
herself
*NL*
began
to
talk
to
her
in
a
more
peremptory
stile
than
before
:
but
her
*NL*
father
treated
her
in
so
violent
and
outrageous
a
manner
,
that
he
*NL*
frightened
her
into
an
affected
compliance
with
his
will
;
which
so
*NL*
highly
pleased
the
good
squire
,
that
he
changed
his
frowns
into
*NL*
smiles
,
and
his
menaces
into
promises
:
he
vowed
his
whole
soul
was
*NL*
wrapt
in
hers
;
that
her
consent
-LRB-
for
so
he
construed
the
words
,
``
You
*NL*
know
,
sir
,
I
must
not
,
nor
can
,
refuse
to
obey
any
absolute
command
of
*NL*
yours
''
-RRB-
had
made
him
the
happiest
of
mankind
.
He
then
gave
her
a
large
*NL*
bank-bill
to
dispose
of
in
any
trinkets
she
pleased
,
and
kissed
and
*NL*
embraced
her
in
the
fondest
manner
,
while
tears
of
joy
trickled
from
*NL*
those
eyes
which
a
few
moments
before
had
darted
fire
and
rage
against
*NL*
the
dear
object
of
all
his
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instances
of
this
behaviour
in
parents
are
so
common
,
that
the
reader
,
*NL*
I
doubt
not
,
will
be
very
little
astonished
at
the
whole
conduct
of
Mr
*NL*
Western
.
If
he
should
,
I
own
I
am
not
able
to
account
for
it
;
since
*NL*
that
he
loved
his
daughter
most
tenderly
,
is
,
I
think
,
beyond
dispute
.
*NL*
So
indeed
have
many
others
,
who
have
rendered
their
children
most
*NL*
completely
miserable
by
the
same
conduct
;
which
,
though
it
is
almost
*NL*
universal
in
parents
,
hath
always
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
most
*NL*
unaccountable
of
all
the
absurdities
which
ever
entered
into
the
brain
*NL*
of
that
strange
prodigious
creature
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
part
of
Mr
Western
's
behaviour
had
so
strong
an
effect
on
*NL*
the
tender
heart
of
Sophia
,
that
it
suggested
a
thought
to
her
,
which
*NL*
not
all
the
sophistry
of
her
politic
aunt
,
nor
all
the
menaces
of
her
*NL*
father
,
had
ever
once
brought
into
her
head
.
She
reverenced
her
father
*NL*
so
piously
,
and
loved
him
so
passionately
,
that
she
had
scarce
ever
*NL*
felt
more
pleasing
sensations
,
than
what
arose
from
the
share
she
*NL*
frequently
had
of
contributing
to
his
amusement
,
and
sometimes
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
to
higher
gratifications
;
for
he
never
could
contain
the
*NL*
delight
of
hearing
her
commended
,
which
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
hearing
almost
every
day
of
her
life
.
The
idea
,
therefore
,
of
the
*NL*
immense
happiness
she
should
convey
to
her
father
by
her
consent
to
*NL*
this
match
,
made
a
strong
impression
on
her
mind
.
Again
,
the
extreme
*NL*
piety
of
such
an
act
of
obedience
worked
very
forcibly
,
as
she
had
a
*NL*
very
deep
sense
of
religion
.
Lastly
,
when
she
reflected
how
much
she
*NL*
herself
was
to
suffer
,
being
indeed
to
become
little
less
than
a
*NL*
sacrifice
,
or
a
martyr
,
to
filial
love
and
duty
,
she
felt
an
agreeable
*NL*
tickling
in
a
certain
little
passion
,
which
though
it
bears
no
*NL*
immediate
affinity
either
to
religion
or
virtue
,
is
often
so
kind
as
*NL*
to
lend
great
assistance
in
executing
the
purposes
of
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
was
charmed
with
the
contemplation
of
so
heroic
an
action
,
and
*NL*
began
to
compliment
herself
with
much
premature
flattery
,
when
Cupid
,
*NL*
who
lay
hid
in
her
muff
,
suddenly
crept
out
,
and
like
Punchinello
in
a
*NL*
puppet-show
,
kicked
all
out
before
him
.
In
truth
-LRB-
for
we
scorn
to
*NL*
deceive
our
reader
,
or
to
vindicate
the
character
of
our
heroine
by
*NL*
ascribing
her
actions
to
supernatural
impulse
-RRB-
the
thoughts
of
her
*NL*
beloved
Jones
,
and
some
hopes
-LRB-
however
distant
-RRB-
in
which
he
was
very
*NL*
particularly
concerned
,
immediately
destroyed
all
which
filial
love
,
*NL*
piety
,
and
pride
had
,
with
their
joint
endeavours
,
been
labouring
to
*NL*
bring
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
we
proceed
any
farther
with
Sophia
,
we
must
now
look
back
*NL*
to
Mr
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
x.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
several
matters
,
natural
enough
perhaps
,
but
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
be
pleased
to
remember
,
that
we
left
Mr
Jones
,
in
the
*NL*
beginning
of
this
book
,
on
his
road
to
Bristol
;
being
determined
to
*NL*
seek
his
fortune
at
sea
,
or
rather
,
indeed
,
to
fly
away
from
his
*NL*
fortune
on
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
-LRB-
a
thing
not
very
unusual
-RRB-
,
that
the
guide
who
undertook
*NL*
to
conduct
him
on
his
way
,
was
unluckily
unacquainted
with
the
road
;
*NL*
so
that
having
missed
his
right
track
,
and
being
ashamed
to
ask
*NL*
information
,
he
rambled
about
backwards
and
forwards
till
night
came
*NL*
on
,
and
it
began
to
grow
dark
.
Jones
suspecting
what
had
happened
,
*NL*
acquainted
the
guide
with
his
apprehensions
;
but
he
insisted
on
it
,
*NL*
that
they
were
in
the
right
road
,
and
added
,
it
would
be
very
strange
*NL*
if
he
should
not
know
the
road
to
Bristol
;
though
,
in
reality
,
it
*NL*
would
have
been
much
stranger
if
he
had
known
it
,
having
never
past
*NL*
through
it
in
his
life
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
not
such
implicit
faith
in
his
guide
,
but
that
on
their
*NL*
arrival
at
a
village
he
inquired
of
the
first
fellow
he
saw
,
whether
*NL*
they
were
in
the
road
to
Bristol
.
``
Whence
did
you
come
?
''
cries
the
*NL*
fellow
.
``
No
matter
,
''
says
Jones
,
a
little
hastily
;
``
I
want
to
know
if
*NL*
this
be
the
road
to
Bristol
?
''
--
``
The
road
to
Bristol
!
''
cries
the
*NL*
fellow
,
scratching
his
head
:
``
why
,
measter
,
I
believe
you
will
hardly
*NL*
get
to
Bristol
this
way
to-night
.
''
--
``
Prithee
,
friend
,
then
,
''
answered
*NL*
Jones
,
``
do
tell
us
which
is
the
way
.
''
--
``
Why
,
measter
,
''
cries
the
*NL*
fellow
,
``
you
must
be
come
out
of
your
road
the
Lord
knows
whither
;
for
*NL*
thick
way
goeth
to
Glocester
.
''
--
``
Well
,
and
which
way
goes
to
Bristol
?
''
*NL*
said
Jones
.
``
Why
,
you
be
going
away
from
Bristol
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
fellow
.
``
Then
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
we
must
go
back
again
?
''
--
``
Ay
,
you
must
,
''
*NL*
said
the
fellow
.
``
Well
,
and
when
we
come
back
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
*NL*
which
way
must
we
take
?
''
--
``
Why
,
you
must
keep
the
strait
road
.
''
--
``
But
*NL*
I
remember
there
are
two
roads
,
one
to
the
right
and
the
other
to
the
*NL*
left
.
''
--
``
Why
,
you
must
keep
the
right-hand
road
,
and
then
gu
strait
*NL*
vorwards
;
only
remember
to
turn
vurst
to
your
right
,
and
then
to
your
*NL*
left
again
,
and
then
to
your
right
,
and
that
brings
you
to
the
*NL*
squire
's
;
and
then
you
must
keep
strait
vorwards
,
and
turn
to
the
*NL*
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
fellow
now
came
up
,
and
asked
which
way
the
gentlemen
were
*NL*
going
;
of
which
being
informed
by
Jones
,
he
first
scratched
his
head
,
*NL*
and
then
leaning
upon
a
pole
he
had
in
his
hand
,
began
to
tell
him
,
*NL*
``
That
he
must
keep
the
right-hand
road
for
about
a
mile
,
or
a
mile
and
*NL*
a
half
,
or
such
a
matter
,
and
then
he
must
turn
short
to
the
left
,
*NL*
which
would
bring
him
round
by
Measter
Jin
Bearnes
's
.
''
--
``
But
which
is
*NL*
Mr
John
Bearnes
's
?
''
says
Jones
.
``
O
Lord
!
''
cries
the
fellow
,
``
why
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
know
Measter
Jin
Bearnes
?
Whence
then
did
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
fellows
had
almost
conquered
the
patience
of
Jones
,
when
a
*NL*
plain
well-looking
man
-LRB-
who
was
indeed
a
Quaker
-RRB-
accosted
him
thus
:
*NL*
``
Friend
,
I
perceive
thou
hast
lost
thy
way
;
and
if
thou
wilt
take
my
*NL*
advice
,
thou
wilt
not
attempt
to
find
it
to-night
.
It
is
almost
dark
,
*NL*
and
the
road
is
difficult
to
hit
;
besides
,
there
have
been
several
*NL*
robberies
committed
lately
between
this
and
Bristol
.
Here
is
a
very
*NL*
creditable
good
house
just
by
,
where
thou
may
`
st
find
good
*NL*
entertainment
for
thyself
and
thy
cattle
till
morning
.
''
Jones
,
after
a
*NL*
little
persuasion
,
agreed
to
stay
in
this
place
till
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
was
conducted
by
his
friend
to
the
public-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
,
who
was
a
very
civil
fellow
,
told
Jones
,
``
He
hoped
he
*NL*
would
excuse
the
badness
of
his
accommodation
;
for
that
his
wife
was
*NL*
gone
from
home
,
and
had
locked
up
almost
everything
,
and
carried
the
*NL*
keys
along
with
her
.
''
Indeed
the
fact
was
,
that
a
favourite
daughter
*NL*
of
hers
was
just
married
,
and
gone
that
morning
home
with
her
husband
;
*NL*
and
that
she
and
her
mother
together
had
almost
stript
the
poor
man
of
*NL*
all
his
goods
,
as
well
as
money
;
for
though
he
had
several
children
,
*NL*
this
daughter
only
,
who
was
the
mother
's
favourite
,
was
the
object
of
*NL*
her
consideration
;
and
to
the
humour
of
this
one
child
she
would
with
*NL*
pleasure
have
sacrificed
all
the
rest
,
and
her
husband
into
the
*NL*
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Jones
was
very
unfit
for
any
kind
of
company
,
and
would
have
*NL*
preferred
being
alone
,
yet
he
could
not
resist
the
importunities
of
*NL*
the
honest
Quaker
;
who
was
the
more
desirous
of
sitting
with
him
,
from
*NL*
having
remarked
the
melancholy
which
appeared
both
in
his
countenance
*NL*
and
behaviour
;
and
which
the
poor
Quaker
thought
his
conversation
*NL*
might
in
some
measure
relieve
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
they
had
past
some
time
together
,
in
such
a
manner
that
my
*NL*
honest
friend
might
have
thought
himself
at
one
of
his
silent
*NL*
meetings
,
the
Quaker
began
to
be
moved
by
some
spirit
or
other
,
*NL*
probably
that
of
curiosity
,
and
said
,
``
Friend
,
I
perceive
some
sad
*NL*
disaster
hath
befallen
thee
;
but
pray
be
of
comfort
.
Perhaps
thou
hast
*NL*
lost
a
friend
.
If
so
,
thou
must
consider
we
are
all
mortal
.
And
why
*NL*
shouldst
thou
grieve
,
when
thou
knowest
thy
grief
will
do
thy
friend
*NL*
no
good
?
We
are
all
born
to
affliction
.
I
myself
have
my
sorrows
as
*NL*
well
as
thee
,
and
most
probably
greater
sorrows
.
Though
I
have
a
clear
*NL*
estate
of
L100
a
year
,
which
is
as
much
as
I
want
,
and
I
have
a
*NL*
conscience
,
I
thank
the
Lord
,
void
of
offence
;
my
constitution
is
*NL*
sound
and
strong
,
and
there
is
no
man
can
demand
a
debt
of
me
,
nor
*NL*
accuse
me
of
an
injury
;
yet
,
friend
,
I
should
be
concerned
to
think
*NL*
thee
as
miserable
as
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
Quaker
ended
with
a
deep
sigh
;
and
Jones
presently
answered
,
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
sir
,
for
your
unhappiness
,
whatever
is
the
occasion
*NL*
of
it
.
''
--
``
Ah
!
friend
,
''
replied
the
Quaker
,
``
one
only
daughter
is
the
*NL*
occasion
;
one
who
was
my
greatest
delight
upon
earth
,
and
who
within
*NL*
this
week
is
run
away
from
me
,
and
is
married
against
my
consent
.
I
*NL*
had
provided
her
a
proper
match
,
a
sober
man
and
one
of
substance
;
but
*NL*
she
,
forsooth
,
would
chuse
for
herself
,
and
away
she
is
gone
with
a
*NL*
young
fellow
not
worth
a
groat
.
If
she
had
been
dead
,
as
I
suppose
thy
*NL*
friend
is
,
I
should
have
been
happy
.
''
--
``
That
is
very
strange
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
said
Jones
.
``
Why
,
would
it
not
be
better
for
her
to
be
dead
,
than
to
*NL*
be
a
beggar
?
''
replied
the
Quaker
:
``
for
,
as
I
told
you
,
the
fellow
is
*NL*
not
worth
a
groat
;
and
surely
she
can
not
expect
that
I
shall
ever
give
*NL*
her
a
shilling
.
No
,
as
she
hath
married
for
love
,
let
her
live
on
love
*NL*
if
she
can
;
let
her
carry
her
love
to
market
,
and
see
whether
any
one
*NL*
will
change
it
into
silver
,
or
even
into
halfpence
.
''
--
``
You
know
your
*NL*
own
concerns
best
,
sir
,
''
said
Jones
.
``
It
must
have
been
,
''
continued
*NL*
the
Quaker
,
``
a
long
premeditated
scheme
to
cheat
me
:
for
they
have
*NL*
known
one
another
from
their
infancy
;
and
I
always
preached
to
her
*NL*
against
love
,
and
told
her
a
thousand
times
over
it
was
all
folly
and
*NL*
wickedness
.
Nay
,
the
cunning
slut
pretended
to
hearken
to
me
,
and
to
*NL*
despise
all
wantonness
of
the
flesh
;
and
yet
at
last
broke
out
at
a
*NL*
window
two
pair
of
stairs
:
for
I
began
,
indeed
,
a
little
to
suspect
*NL*
her
,
and
had
locked
her
up
carefully
,
intending
the
very
next
morning
*NL*
to
have
married
her
up
to
my
liking
.
But
she
disappointed
me
within
a
*NL*
few
hours
,
and
escaped
away
to
the
lover
of
her
own
chusing
;
who
lost
*NL*
no
time
,
for
they
were
married
and
bedded
and
all
within
an
hour
.
But
*NL*
it
shall
be
the
worst
hour
's
work
for
them
both
that
ever
they
did
;
*NL*
for
they
may
starve
,
or
beg
,
or
steal
together
,
for
me
.
I
will
never
*NL*
give
either
of
them
a
farthing
.
''
Here
Jones
starting
up
cried
,
``
I
*NL*
really
must
be
excused
:
I
wish
you
would
leave
me
.
''
--
``
Come
,
come
,
*NL*
friend
,
''
said
the
Quaker
,
``
do
n't
give
way
to
concern
.
You
see
there
*NL*
are
other
people
miserable
besides
yourself
.
''
--
``
I
see
there
are
*NL*
madmen
,
and
fools
,
and
villains
in
the
world
,
''
cries
Jones
.
``
But
let
*NL*
me
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
:
send
for
your
daughter
and
son-in-law
*NL*
home
,
and
do
n't
be
yourself
the
only
cause
of
misery
to
one
you
*NL*
pretend
to
love
.
''
--
``
Send
for
her
and
her
husband
home
!
''
cries
the
*NL*
Quaker
loudly
;
``
I
would
sooner
send
for
the
two
greatest
enemies
I
*NL*
have
in
the
world
!
''
--
``
Well
,
go
home
yourself
,
or
where
you
please
,
''
*NL*
said
Jones
,
``
for
I
will
sit
no
longer
in
such
company
.
''
--
``
Nay
,
*NL*
friend
,
''
answered
the
Quaker
,
``
I
scorn
to
impose
my
company
on
any
*NL*
one
.
''
He
then
offered
to
pull
money
from
his
pocket
,
but
Jones
pushed
*NL*
him
with
some
violence
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
of
the
Quaker
's
discourse
had
so
deeply
affected
Jones
,
*NL*
that
he
stared
very
wildly
all
the
time
he
was
speaking
.
This
the
*NL*
Quaker
had
observed
,
and
this
,
added
to
the
rest
of
his
behaviour
,
*NL*
inspired
honest
Broadbrim
with
a
conceit
,
that
his
companion
was
in
*NL*
reality
out
of
his
senses
.
Instead
of
resenting
the
affront
,
*NL*
therefore
,
the
Quaker
was
moved
with
compassion
for
his
unhappy
*NL*
circumstances
;
and
having
communicated
his
opinion
to
the
landlord
,
he
*NL*
desired
him
to
take
great
care
of
his
guest
,
and
to
treat
him
with
the
*NL*
highest
civility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
''
says
the
landlord
,
``
I
shall
use
no
such
civility
towards
*NL*
him
;
for
it
seems
,
for
all
his
laced
waistcoat
there
,
he
is
no
more
a
*NL*
gentleman
than
myself
,
but
a
poor
parish
bastard
,
bred
up
at
a
great
*NL*
squire
's
about
thirty
miles
off
,
and
now
turned
out
of
doors
-LRB-
not
for
*NL*
any
good
to
be
sure
-RRB-
.
I
shall
get
him
out
of
my
house
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
.
If
I
do
lose
my
reckoning
,
the
first
loss
is
always
the
*NL*
best
.
It
is
not
above
a
year
ago
that
I
lost
a
silver
spoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
dost
thou
talk
of
a
parish
bastard
,
Robin
?
''
answered
the
Quaker
.
*NL*
``
Thou
must
certainly
be
mistaken
in
thy
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
replied
Robin
;
``
the
guide
,
who
knows
him
very
well
,
told
*NL*
it
me
.
''
For
,
indeed
,
the
guide
had
no
sooner
taken
his
place
at
the
*NL*
kitchen
fire
,
than
he
acquainted
the
whole
company
with
all
he
knew
or
*NL*
had
ever
heard
concerning
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Quaker
was
no
sooner
assured
by
this
fellow
of
the
birth
and
low
*NL*
fortune
of
Jones
,
than
all
compassion
for
him
vanished
;
and
the
honest
*NL*
plain
man
went
home
fired
with
no
less
indignation
than
a
duke
would
*NL*
have
felt
at
receiving
an
affront
from
such
a
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
himself
conceived
an
equal
disdain
for
his
guest
;
so
that
*NL*
when
Jones
rung
the
bell
in
order
to
retire
to
bed
,
he
was
acquainted
*NL*
that
he
could
have
no
bed
there
.
Besides
disdain
of
the
mean
condition
*NL*
of
his
guest
,
Robin
entertained
violent
suspicion
of
his
intentions
,
*NL*
which
were
,
he
supposed
,
to
watch
some
favourable
opportunity
of
*NL*
robbing
the
house
.
In
reality
,
he
might
have
been
very
well
eased
of
*NL*
these
apprehensions
,
by
the
prudent
precautions
of
his
wife
and
*NL*
daughter
,
who
had
already
removed
everything
which
was
not
fixed
to
*NL*
the
freehold
;
but
he
was
by
nature
suspicious
,
and
had
been
more
*NL*
particularly
so
since
the
loss
of
his
spoon
.
In
short
,
the
dread
of
*NL*
being
robbed
totally
absorbed
the
comfortable
consideration
that
he
*NL*
had
nothing
to
lose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
being
assured
that
he
could
have
no
bed
,
very
contentedly
betook
*NL*
himself
to
a
great
chair
made
with
rushes
,
when
sleep
,
which
had
*NL*
lately
shunned
his
company
in
much
better
apartments
,
generously
paid
*NL*
him
a
visit
in
his
humble
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
landlord
,
he
was
prevented
by
his
fears
from
retiring
to
*NL*
rest
.
He
returned
therefore
to
the
kitchen
fire
,
whence
he
could
*NL*
survey
the
only
door
which
opened
into
the
parlour
,
or
rather
hole
,
*NL*
where
Jones
was
seated
;
and
as
for
the
window
to
that
room
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
any
creature
larger
than
a
cat
to
have
made
his
escape
*NL*
through
it
.

The

*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
having
taken
his
seat
directly
opposite
to
the
door
of
*NL*
the
parlour
,
determined
to
keep
guard
there
the
whole
night
.
The
guide
*NL*
and
another
fellow
remained
long
on
duty
with
him
,
though
they
neither
*NL*
knew
his
suspicions
,
nor
had
any
of
their
own
.
The
true
cause
of
their
*NL*
watching
did
,
indeed

at

put
an
end
to
it
;
for
this
was
no
*NL*
other
than
the
strength
and
goodness
of
the
beer
,
of
which
having
*NL*
tippled
a
very
large
quantity
,
they
grew
at
first
very
noisy
and
*NL*
vociferous
,
and
afterwards
fell
both
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
liquor
to
compose
the
fears
of
Robin
.
*NL*
He
continued
still
waking
in
his
chair
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
stedfastly
*NL*
on
the
door
which
led
into
the
apartment
of
Mr
Jones
,
till
a
violent
*NL*
thundering
at
his
outward
gate
called
him
from
his
seat
,
and
obliged
*NL*
him
to
open
it
;
which
he
had
no
sooner
done
,
than
his
kitchen
was
*NL*
immediately
full
of
gentlemen
in
red
coats
,
who
all
rushed
upon
him
in
*NL*
as
tumultuous
a
manner
as
if
they
intended
to
take
his
little
castle
*NL*
by
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
was
now
forced
from
his
post
to
furnish
his
numerous
*NL*
guests
with
beer
,
which
they
called
for
with
great
eagerness
;
and
upon
*NL*
his
second
or
third
return
from
the
cellar
,
he
saw
Mr
Jones
standing
*NL*
before
the
fire
in
the
midst
of
the
soldiers
;
for
it
may
easily
be
*NL*
believed
,
that
the
arrival
of
so
much
good
company
should
put
an
end
*NL*
to
any
sleep
,
unless
that
from
which
we
are
to
be
awakened
only
by
the
*NL*
last
trumpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
having
now
pretty
well
satisfied
their
thirst
,
nothing
*NL*
remained
but
to
pay
the
reckoning
,
a
circumstance
often
productive
of
*NL*
much
mischief
and
discontent
among
the
inferior
rank
of
gentry
,
who
*NL*
are
apt
to
find
great
difficulty
in
assessing
the
sum
,
with
exact
*NL*
regard
to
distributive
justice
,
which
directs
that
every
man
shall
pay
*NL*
according
to
the
quantity
which
he
drinks
.
This
difficulty
occurred
*NL*
upon
the
present
occasion
;
and
it
was
the
greater
,
as
some
gentlemen
*NL*
had
,
in
their
extreme
hurry
,
marched
off
,
after
their
first
draught
,
*NL*
and
had
entirely
forgot
to
contribute
anything
towards
the
said
*NL*
reckoning
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
violent
dispute
now
arose
,
in
which
every
word
may
be
said
to
have
*NL*
been
deposed
upon
oath
;
for
the
oaths
were
at
least
equal
to
all
the
*NL*
other
words
spoken
.
In
this
controversy
the
whole
company
spoke
*NL*
together
,
and
every
man
seemed
wholly
bent
to
extenuate
the
sum
which
*NL*
fell
to
his
share
;
so
that
the
most
probable
conclusion
which
could
be
*NL*
foreseen
was
,
that
a
large
portion
of
the
reckoning
would
fall
to
the
*NL*
landlord
's
share
to
pay
,
or
-LRB-
what
is
much
the
same
thing
-RRB-
would
remain
*NL*
unpaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
Mr
Jones
was
engaged
in
conversation
with
the
serjeant
;
*NL*
for
that
officer
was
entirely
unconcerned
in
the
present
dispute
,
*NL*
being
privileged
by
immemorial
custom
from
all
contribution
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dispute
now
grew
so
very
warm
that
it
seemed
to
draw
towards
a
*NL*
military
decision
,
when
Jones
,
stepping
forward
,
silenced
all
their
*NL*
clamours
at
once
,
by
declaring
that
he
would
pay
the
whole
reckoning
,
*NL*
which
indeed
amounted
to
no
more
than
three
shillings
and
fourpence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
declaration
procured
Jones
the
thanks
and
applause
of
the
whole
*NL*
company
.
The
terms
honourable
,
noble
,
and
worthy
gentleman
,
resounded
*NL*
through
the
room
;
nay
,
my
landlord
himself
began
to
have
a
better
*NL*
opinion
of
him
,
and
almost
to
disbelieve
the
account
which
the
guide
*NL*
had
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
serjeant
had
informed
Mr
Jones
that
they
were
marching
against
the
*NL*
rebels
,
and
expected
to
be
commanded
by
the
glorious
Duke
of
*NL*
Cumberland
.
By
which
the
reader
may
perceive
-LRB-
a
circumstance
which
we
*NL*
have
not
thought
necessary
to
communicate
before
-RRB-
that
this
was
the
*NL*
very
time
when
the
late
rebellion
was
at
the
highest
;
and
indeed
the
*NL*
banditti
were
now
marched
into
England
,
intending
,
as
it
was
thought
,
*NL*
to
fight
the
king
's
forces
,
and
to
attempt
pushing
forward
to
the
*NL*
metropolis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
some
heroic
ingredients
in
his
composition
,
and
was
a
hearty
*NL*
well-wisher
to
the
glorious
cause
of
liberty
,
and
of
the
Protestant
*NL*
religion
.
It
is
no
wonder
,
therefore
,
that
in
circumstances
which
*NL*
would
have
warranted
a
much
more
romantic
and
wild
undertaking
,
it
*NL*
should
occur
to
him
to
serve
as
a
volunteer
in
this
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
commanding
officer
had
said
all
in
his
power
to
encourage
and
*NL*
promote
this
good
disposition
,
from
the
first
moment
he
had
been
*NL*
acquainted
with
it
.
He
now
proclaimed
the
noble
resolution
aloud
,
*NL*
which
was
received
with
great
pleasure
by
the
whole
company
,
who
all
*NL*
cried
out
,
``
God
bless
King
George
and
your
honour
;
''
and
then
added
,
*NL*
with
many
oaths
,
``
We
will
stand
by
you
both
to
the
last
drops
of
our
*NL*
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
who
had
been
all
night
tippling
at
the
alehouse
,
was
*NL*
prevailed
on
by
some
arguments
which
a
corporal
had
put
into
his
*NL*
hands
,
to
undertake
the
same
expedition
.
And
now
the
portmanteau
*NL*
belonging
to
Mr
Jones
being
put
up
in
the
baggage-cart
,
the
forces
*NL*
were
about
to
move
forwards
;
when
the
guide
,
stepping
up
to
Jones
,
*NL*
said
,
``
Sir
,
I
hope
you
will
consider
that
the
horses
have
been
kept
*NL*
out
all
night
,
and
we
have
travelled
a
great
ways
out
of
our
way
.
''
*NL*
Jones
was
surprized
at
the
impudence
of
this
demand
,
and
acquainted
*NL*
the
soldiers
with
the
merits
of
his
cause
,
who
were
all
unanimous
in
*NL*
condemning
the
guide
for
his
endeavours
to
put
upon
a
gentleman
.
Some
*NL*
said
,
he
ought
to
be
tied
neck
and
heels
;
others
that
he
deserved
to
*NL*
run
the
gantlope
;
and
the
serjeant
shook
his
cane
at
him
,
and
wished
*NL*
he
had
him
under
his
command
,
swearing
heartily
he
would
make
an
*NL*
example
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
contented
himself
however
with
a
negative
punishment
,
and
walked
*NL*
off
with
his
new
comrades
,
leaving
the
guide
to
the
poor
revenge
of
*NL*
cursing
and
reviling
him
;
in
which
latter
the
landlord
joined
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
he
is
a
pure
one
,
I
warrant
you
.
A
pretty
gentleman
,
indeed
,
*NL*
to
go
for
a
soldier
!
He
shall
wear
a
laced
wastecoat
truly
.
It
is
an
*NL*
old
proverb
and
a
true
one
,
all
is
not
gold
that
glisters
.
I
am
glad
*NL*
my
house
is
well
rid
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
day
the
serjeant
and
the
young
soldier
marched
together
;
and
*NL*
the
former
,
who
was
an
arch
fellow
,
told
the
latter
many
entertaining
*NL*
stories
of
his
campaigns
,
though
in
reality
he
had
never
made
any
;
for
*NL*
he
was
but
lately
come
into
the
service
,
and
had
,
by
his
own
*NL*
dexterity
,
so
well
ingratiated
himself
with
his
officers
,
that
he
had
*NL*
promoted
himself
to
a
halberd
;
chiefly
indeed
by
his
merit
in
*NL*
recruiting
,
in
which
he
was
most
excellently
well
skilled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
mirth
and
festivity
passed
among
the
soldiers
during
their
march
.
*NL*
In
which
the
many
occurrences
that
had
passed
at
their
last
quarters
*NL*
were
remembered
,
and
every
one
,
with
great
freedom
,
made
what
jokes
he
*NL*
pleased
on
his
officers
,
some
of
which
were
of
the
coarser
kind
,
and
*NL*
very
near
bordering
on
scandal
.
This
brought
to
our
heroe
's
mind
the
*NL*
custom
which
he
had
read
of
among
the
Greeks
and
Romans
,
of
indulging
,
*NL*
on
certain
festivals
and
solemn
occasions
,
the
liberty
to
slaves
,
of
*NL*
using
an
uncontrouled
freedom
of
speech
towards
their
masters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
little
army
,
which
consisted
of
two
companies
of
foot
,
were
now
*NL*
arrived
at
the
place
where
they
were
to
halt
that
evening
.
The
*NL*
serjeant
then
acquainted
his
lieutenant
,
who
was
the
commanding
*NL*
officer
,
that
they
had
picked
up
two
fellows
in
that
day
's
march
,
one
*NL*
of
which
,
he
said
,
was
as
fine
a
man
as
ever
he
saw
-LRB-
meaning
the
*NL*
tippler
-RRB-
,
for
that
he
was
near
six
feet
,
well
proportioned
,
and
*NL*
strongly
limbed
;
and
the
other
-LRB-
meaning
Jones
-RRB-
would
do
well
enough
*NL*
for
the
rear
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
soldiers
were
now
produced
before
the
officer
,
who
having
*NL*
examined
the
six-feet
man
,
he
being
first
produced
,
came
next
to
*NL*
survey
Jones
:
at
the
first
sight
of
whom
,
the
lieutenant
could
not
*NL*
help
showing
some
surprize
;
for
besides
that
he
was
very
well
dressed
,
*NL*
and
was
naturally
genteel
,
he
had
a
remarkable
air
of
dignity
in
his
*NL*
look
,
which
is
rarely
seen
among
the
vulgar
,
and
is
indeed
not
*NL*
inseparably
annexed
to
the
features
of
their
superiors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
the
lieutenant
,
``
my
serjeant
informed
me
that
you
are
*NL*
desirous
of
enlisting
in
the
company
I
have
at
present
under
my
*NL*
command
;
if
so
,
sir
,
we
shall
very
gladly
receive
a
gentleman
who
*NL*
promises
to
do
much
honour
to
the
company
by
bearing
arms
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
answered
:
``
That
he
had
not
mentioned
anything
of
enlisting
*NL*
himself
;
that
he
was
most
zealously
attached
to
the
glorious
cause
for
*NL*
which
they
were
going
to
fight
,
and
was
very
desirous
of
serving
as
a
*NL*
volunteer
;
''
concluding
with
some
compliments
to
the
lieutenant
,
and
*NL*
expressing
the
great
satisfaction
he
should
have
in
being
under
his
*NL*
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
returned
his
civility
,
commended
his
resolution
,
shook
*NL*
him
by
the
hand
,
and
invited
him
to
dine
with
himself
and
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
officers
.

Chapter
xii
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adventure
of
a
company
of
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
,
whom
we
mentioned
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
and
who
*NL*
commanded
this
party
,
was
now
near
sixty
years
of
age
.
He
had
entered
*NL*
very
young
into
the
army
,
and
had
served
in
the
capacity
of
an
ensign
*NL*
at
the
battle
of
Tannieres
;
here
he
had
received
two
wounds
,
and
had
*NL*
so
well
distinguished
himself
,
that
he
was
by
the
Duke
of
Marlborough
*NL*
advanced
to
be
a
lieutenant
,
immediately
after
that
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
commission
he
had
continued
ever
since
,
viz.
,
near
forty
*NL*
years
;
during
which
time
he
had
seen
vast
numbers
preferred
over
his
*NL*
head
,
and
had
now
the
mortification
to
be
commanded
by
boys
,
whose
*NL*
fathers
were
at
nurse
when
he
first
entered
into
the
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
this
ill
success
in
his
profession
solely
owing
to
his
having
*NL*
no
friends
among
the
men
in
power
.
He
had
the
misfortune
to
incur
the
*NL*
displeasure
of
his
colonel
,
who
for
many
years
continued
in
the
*NL*
command
of
this
regiment
.
Nor
did
he
owe
the
implacable
ill-will
which
*NL*
this
man
bore
him
to
any
neglect
or
deficiency
as
an
officer
,
nor
*NL*
indeed
to
any
fault
in
himself
;
but
solely
to
the
indiscretion
of
his
*NL*
wife
,
who
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
,
and
who
,
though
she
was
*NL*
remarkably
fond
of
her
husband
,
would
not
purchase
his
preferment
at
*NL*
the
expense
of
certain
favours
which
the
colonel
required
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
lieutenant
was
more
peculiarly
unhappy
in
this
,
that
while
he
*NL*
felt
the
effects
of
the
enmity
of
his
colonel
,
he
neither
knew
,
nor
*NL*
suspected
,
that
he
really
bore
him
any
;
for
he
could
not
suspect
an
*NL*
ill-will
for
which
he
was
not
conscious
of
giving
any
cause
;
and
his
*NL*
wife
,
fearing
what
her
husband
's
nice
regard
to
his
honour
might
have
*NL*
occasioned
,
contented
herself
with
preserving
her
virtue
without
*NL*
enjoying
the
triumphs
of
her
conquest
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unfortunate
officer
-LRB-
for
so
I
think
he
may
be
called
-RRB-
had
many
*NL*
good
qualities
besides
his
merit
in
his
profession
;
for
he
was
a
*NL*
religious
,
honest
,
good-natured
man
;
and
had
behaved
so
well
in
his
*NL*
command
,
that
he
was
highly
esteemed
and
beloved
not
only
by
the
*NL*
soldiers
of
his
own
company
,
but
by
the
whole
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
officers
who
marched
with
him
were
a
French
lieutenant
,
who
*NL*
had
been
long
enough
out
of
France
to
forget
his
own
language
,
but
not
*NL*
long
enough
in
England
to
learn
ours
,
so
that
he
really
spoke
no
*NL*
language
at
all
,
and
could
barely
make
himself
understood
on
the
most
*NL*
ordinary
occasions
.
There
were
likewise
two
ensigns
,
both
very
young
*NL*
fellows
;
one
of
whom
had
been
bred
under
an
attorney
,
and
the
other
*NL*
was
son
to
the
wife
of
a
nobleman
's
butler
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
dinner
was
ended
,
Jones
informed
the
company
of
the
*NL*
merriment
which
had
passed
among
the
soldiers
upon
their
march
;
``
and
*NL*
yet
,
''
says
he
,
``
notwithstanding
all
their
vociferation
,
I
dare
swear
*NL*
they
will
behave
more
like
Grecians
than
Trojans
when
they
come
to
the
*NL*
enemy
.
''
--
``
Grecians
and
Trojans
!
''
says
one
of
the
ensigns
,
``
who
the
*NL*
devil
are
they
?
I
have
heard
of
all
the
troops
in
Europe
,
but
never
of
*NL*
any
such
as
these
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
pretend
to
more
ignorance
than
you
have
,
Mr
Northerton
,
''
said
*NL*
the
worthy
lieutenant
.
``
I
suppose
you
have
heard
of
the
Greeks
and
*NL*
Trojans
,
though
perhaps
you
never
read
Pope
's
Homer
;
who
,
I
remember
,
*NL*
now
the
gentleman
mentions
it
,
compares
the
march
of

he
;

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
give

good

said
the
lieutenant

*NL*
``

a
very

But
prithee

Northerton

off

wicked
custom

it

I
wish

too
,
you
would
take
my

Scandalous
names

and
reflections
cast
on
any

of
men
,
*NL*
must
be
always
unjustifiable
;
but
especially
so
,
when
thrown
on
so
*NL*
sacred
a
function
;
for
to
abuse
the
body
is
to
abuse
the
function
*NL*
itself

I
leave
to
you
to
judge
how
inconsistent
such
behaviour
is

*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Adderly
,
which
was
the
name
of
the
other
ensign
,
had
sat
hitherto
*NL*
kicking
his
heels
and
humming
a
tune
,
without
seeming
to
listen
to
the
*NL*
discourse
;
he
now
answered
,
''
_
O

``
Well
said

cries
Northerton
:
``
if
*NL*
_
la

was
the
only

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know

''
said
Jones
,
``
what
may
be
your
opinion
;
but
*NL*
I
think
no
man
can
engage
in
a
nobler
cause
than
that
of
his
religion
;
*NL*
and
I
have
observed
,
in
the
little
I
have
read
of
history
,
that
no
*NL*
soldiers
have
fought
so
bravely
as
those
who
have
been
inspired
with
a
*NL*
religious
zeal
:
for
my
own
part
,
though
I
love
my
king
and
country
,
I
*NL*
hope
,
as
well
as
any
man
in
it
,
yet
the
Protestant
interest
is
no
*NL*
small
motive
to
my
becoming
a
volunteer
in
the
cause
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Northerton
now
winked
on
Adderly
,
and
whispered
to
him
slily
,
``
Smoke
*NL*
the
prig
,
Adderly
,
smoke

''
Then
turning
to
Jones
,
said
to
him
,
``
I
*NL*
am
very
glad
,
sir
,
you
have
chosen
our

if
our
parson
should
at
any
time
take
a
cup
too
much
,
I
find
you
*NL*
can
supply
his
place

I
presume
,
sir
,
you
have
been
at
the
university
;
*NL*
may
I
crave
the
favour
to
know
what
college
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

''
answered
Jones
,
``
so
far
from
having
been
at
the
university
,
I
*NL*
have
even
had
the
advantage
of
yourself

I
was
never
at

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
presumed

cries
the
ensign
,
``
only
upon
the
information
of
your
*NL*
great
learning

''
--
``
Oh
!
sir
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
it
is
as
possible
for
a
*NL*
man
to
know
something
without
having
been
at
school
,
as
it
is
to
have
*NL*
been
at
school
and
to
know
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
said
,
young
volunteer
,
''
cries
the
lieutenant
.
``
Upon
my
word
,
*NL*
Northerton
,
you
had
better
let
him
alone
;
for
he
will
be
too
hard
for
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Northerton
did
not
very
well
relish
the
sarcasm
of
Jones
;
but
he
*NL*
thought
the
provocation
was
scarce
sufficient
to
justify
a
blow
,
or
a
*NL*
rascal
,
or
scoundrel
,
which
were
the
only
repartees
that
suggested
*NL*
themselves
.
He
was
,
therefore
,
silent
at
present
;
but
resolved
to
take
*NL*
the
first
opportunity
of
returning
the
jest
by
abuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
now
came
to
the
turn
of
Mr
Jones
to
give
a
toast
,
as
it
is
called
;
*NL*
who
could
not
refrain
from
mentioning
his
dear
Sophia
.
This
he
did
the
*NL*
more
readily
,
as
he
imagined
it
utterly
impossible
that
any
one
*NL*
present
should
guess
the
person
he
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
lieutenant
,
who
was
the
toast-master
,
was
not
contented
with
*NL*
Sophia
only
.
He
said
,
he
must
have
her
sir-name
;
upon
which
Jones
*NL*
hesitated
a
little
,
and
presently
after
named
Miss
Sophia
Western
.
*NL*
Ensign
Northerton
declared
he
would
not
drink
her
health
in
the
same
*NL*
round
with
his
own
toast
,
unless
somebody
would
vouch
for
her
.
``
I
knew
*NL*
one
Sophy
Western
,
''
says
he
,
``
that
was
lain
with
by
half
the
young
*NL*
fellows
at
Bath
;
and
perhaps
this
is
the
same
woman
.
''
Jones
very
*NL*
solemnly
assured
him
of
the
contrary
;
asserting
that
the
young
lady
he
*NL*
named
was
one
of
great
fashion
and
fortune
.
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
says
the
ensign
,
*NL*
``
and
so
she
is
:
d
--
n
me
,
it
is
the
same
woman
;
and
I
'll
hold
half
a
*NL*
dozen
of
Burgundy
,
Tom
French
of
our
regiment
brings
her
into
company
*NL*
with
us
at
any
tavern
in
Bridges-street
.
''
He
then
proceeded
to
*NL*
describe
her
person
exactly
-LRB-
for
he
had
seen
her
with
her
aunt
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
concluded
with
saying
,
``
that
her
father
had
a
great
estate
in
*NL*
Somersetshire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tenderness
of
lovers
can
ill
brook
the
least
jesting
with
the
*NL*
names
of
their
mistresses
.
However
,
Jones
,
though
he
had
enough
of
the
*NL*
lover
and
of
the
heroe
too
in
his
disposition
,
did
not
resent
these
*NL*
slanders
as
hastily
as
,
perhaps
,
he
ought
to
have
done
.
To
say
the
*NL*
truth
,
having
seen
but
little
of
this
kind
of
wit
,
he
did
not
readily
*NL*
understand
it
,
and
for
a
long
time
imagined
Mr
Northerton
had
really
*NL*
mistaken
his
charmer
for
some
other
.
But
now
,
turning
to
the
ensign
*NL*
with
a
stern
aspect
,
he
said
,
``
Pray
,
sir
,
chuse
some
other
subject
for
*NL*
your
wit
;
for
I
promise
you
I
will
bear
no
jesting
with
this
lady
's
*NL*
character
.
''
``
Jesting
!
''
cries
the
other
,
``
d
--
n
me
if
ever
I
was
more
in
*NL*
earnest
in
my
life
.
Tom
French
of
our
regiment
had
both
her
and
her
*NL*
aunt
at
Bath
.
''
``
Then
I
must
tell
you
in
earnest
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
that
*NL*
you
are
one
of
the
most
impudent
rascals
upon
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
sooner
spoken
these
words
,
than
the
ensign
,
together
with
a
*NL*
volley
of
curses
,
discharged
a
bottle
full
at
the
head
of
Jones
,
which
*NL*
hitting
him
a
little
above
the
right
temple
,
brought
him
instantly
to
*NL*
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conqueror
perceiving
the
enemy
to
lie
motionless
before
him
,
and
*NL*
blood
beginning
to
flow
pretty
plentifully
from
his
wound
,
began
now
*NL*
to
think
of
quitting
the
field
of
battle
,
where
no
more
honour
was
to
*NL*
be
gotten
;
but
the
lieutenant
interposed
,
by
stepping
before
the
door
,
*NL*
and
thus
cut
off
his
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Northerton
was
very
importunate
with
the
lieutenant
for
his
liberty
;
*NL*
urging
the
ill
consequences
of
his
stay
,
asking
him
,
what
he
could
*NL*
have
done
less
?
``
Zounds
!
''
says
he
,
``
I
was
but
in
jest
with
the
fellow
.
*NL*
I
never
heard
any
harm
of
Miss
Western
in
my
life
.
''
``
Have
not
you
?
''
*NL*
said
the
lieutenant
;
``
then
you
richly
deserve
to
be
hanged
,
as
well
*NL*
for
making
such
jests
,
as
for
using
such
a
weapon
:
you
are
my
*NL*
prisoner
,
sir
;
nor
shall
you
stir
from
hence
till
a
proper
guard
comes
*NL*
to
secure
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
an
ascendant
had
our
lieutenant
over
this
ensign
,
that
all
that
*NL*
fervency
of
courage
which
had
levelled
our
poor
heroe
with
the
floor
,
*NL*
would
scarce
have
animated
the
said
ensign
to
have
drawn
his
sword
*NL*
against
the
lieutenant
,
had
he
then
had
one
dangling
at
his
side
:
but
*NL*
all
the
swords
being
hung
up
in
the
room
,
were
,
at
the
very
beginning
*NL*
of
the
fray
,
secured
by
the
French
officer
.
So
that
Mr
Northerton
was
*NL*
obliged
to
attend
the
final
issue
of
this
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
gentleman
and
Mr
Adderly
,
at
the
desire
of
their
commanding
*NL*
officer
,
had
raised
up
the
body
of
Jones
,
but
as
they
could
perceive
*NL*
but
little
-LRB-
if
any
-RRB-
sign
of
life
in
him
,
they
again
let
him
fall
,
*NL*
Adderly
damning
him
for
having
blooded
his
wastecoat
;
and
the
*NL*
Frenchman
declaring
,
``
Begar
,
me
no
tush
the
Engliseman
de
mort
:
me
*NL*
have
heard
de
Englise
ley
,
law
,
what
you
call
,
hang
up
de
man
dat
tush
*NL*
him
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
good
lieutenant
applied
himself
to
the
door
,
he
applied
*NL*
himself
likewise
to
the
bell
;
and
the
drawer
immediately
attending
,
he
*NL*
dispatched
him
for
a
file
of
musqueteers
and
a
surgeon
.
These
*NL*
commands
,
together
with
the
drawer
's
report
of
what
he
had
himself
*NL*
seen
,
not
only
produced
the
soldiers
,
but
presently
drew
up
the
*NL*
landlord
of
the
house
,
his
wife
,
and
servants
,
and
,
indeed
,
every
one
*NL*
else
who
happened
at
that
time
to
be
in
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
describe
every
particular
,
and
to
relate
the
whole
conversation
of
*NL*
the
ensuing
scene
,
is
not
within
my
power
,
unless
I
had
forty
pens
,
*NL*
and
could
,
at
once
,
write
with
them
all
together
,
as
the
company
now
*NL*
spoke
.
The
reader
must
,
therefore
,
content
himself
with
the
most
*NL*
remarkable
incidents
,
and
perhaps
he
may
very
well
excuse
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
done
was
securing
the
body
of
Northerton
,
who
being
*NL*
delivered
into
the
custody
of
six
men
with
a
corporal
at
their
head
,
*NL*
was
by
them
conducted
from
a
place
which
he
was
very
willing
to
leave
,
*NL*
but
it
was
unluckily
to
a
place
whither
he
was
very
unwilling
to
go
.
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
so
whimsical
are
the
desires
of
ambition
,
the
very
*NL*
moment
this
youth
had
attained
the
above-mentioned
honour
,
he
would
*NL*
have
been
well
contented
to
have
retired
to
some
corner
of
the
world
,
*NL*
where
the
fame
of
it
should
never
have
reached
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
surprizes
us
,
and
so
perhaps
,
it
may
the
reader
,
that
the
*NL*
lieutenant
,
a
worthy
and
good
man
,
should
have
applied
his
chief
care
,
*NL*
rather
to
secure
the
offender
,
than
to
preserve
the
life
of
the
*NL*
wounded
person
.
We
mention
this
observation
,
not
with
any
view
of
*NL*
pretending
to
account
for
so
odd
a
behaviour
,
but
lest
some
critic
*NL*
should
hereafter
plume
himself
on
discovering
it
.
We
would
have
these
*NL*
gentlemen
know
we
can
see
what
is
odd
in
characters
as
well
as
*NL*
themselves
,
but
it
is
our
business
to
relate
facts
as
they
are
;
which
,
*NL*
when
we
have
done
,
it
is
the
part
of
the
learned
and
sagacious
reader
*NL*
to
consult
that
original
book
of
nature
,
whence
every
passage
in
our
*NL*
work
is
transcribed
,
though
we
quote
not
always
the
particular
page
*NL*
for
its
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
which
now
arrived
were
of
a
different
disposition
.
They
*NL*
suspended
their
curiosity
concerning
the
person
of
the
ensign
,
till
*NL*
they
should
see
him
hereafter
in
a
more
engaging
attitude
.
At
present
,
*NL*
their
whole
concern
and
attention
were
employed
about
the
bloody
*NL*
object
on
the
floor
;
which
being
placed
upright
in
a
chair
,
soon
began
*NL*
to
discover
some
symptoms
of
life
and
motion
.
These
were
no
sooner
*NL*
perceived
by
the
company
-LRB-
for
Jones
was
at
first
generally
concluded
*NL*
to
be
dead
-RRB-
than
they
all
fell
at
once
to
prescribing
for
him
-LRB-
for
as
*NL*
none
of
the
physical
order
was
present
,
every
one
there
took
that
*NL*
office
upon
him
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bleeding
was
the
unanimous
voice
of
the
whole
room
;
but
unluckily
*NL*
there
was
no
operator
at
hand
;
every
one
then
cried
,
``
Call
the
*NL*
barber
;
''
but
none
stirred
a
step
.
Several
cordials
was
likewise
*NL*
prescribed
in
the
same
ineffective
manner
;
till
the
landlord
ordered
*NL*
up
a
tankard
of
strong
beer
,
with
a
toast
,
which
he
said
was
the
best
*NL*
cordial
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
person
principally
assistant
on
this
occasion
,
indeed
the
only
one
*NL*
who
did
any
service
,
or
seemed
likely
to
do
any
,
was
the
landlady
:
she
*NL*
cut
off
some
of
her
hair
,
and
applied
it
to
the
wound
to
stop
the
*NL*
blood
;
she
fell
to
chafing
the
youth
's
temples
with
her
hand
;
and
*NL*
having
exprest
great
contempt
for
her
husband
's
prescription
of
beer
,
*NL*
she
despatched
one
of
her
maids
to
her
own
closet
for
a
bottle
of
*NL*
brandy
,
of
which
,
as
soon
as
it
was
brought
,
she
prevailed
on
Jones
,
*NL*
who
was
just
returned
to
his
senses
,
to
drink
a
very
large
and
*NL*
plentiful
draught
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
afterwards
arrived
the
surgeon
,
who
having
viewed
the
wound
,
*NL*
having
shaken
his
head
,
and
blamed
everything
which
was
done
,
ordered
*NL*
his
patient
instantly
to
bed
;
in
which
place
we
think
proper
to
leave
*NL*
him
some
time
to
his
repose
,
and
shall
here
,
therefore
,
put
an
end
to
*NL*
this
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
xiii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
the
great
address
of
the
landlady
,
the
great
learning
of
a
*NL*
surgeon
,
and
the
solid
skill
in
casuistry
of
the
worthy
lieutenant
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
wounded
man
was
carried
to
his
bed
,
and
the
house
began
again
*NL*
to
clear
up
from
the
hurry
which
this
accident
had
occasioned
,
the
*NL*
landlady
thus
addressed
the
commanding
officer
:
``
I
am
afraid
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
``
this
young
man
did
not
behave
himself
as
well
as
he
should
*NL*
do
to
your
honours
;
and
if
he
had
been
killed
,
I
suppose
he
had
but
*NL*
his
desarts
:
to
be
sure
,
when
gentlemen
admit
inferior
parsons
into
*NL*
their
company
,
they
oft
to
keep
their
distance
;
but
,
as
my
first
*NL*
husband
used
to
say
,
few
of
'em
know
how
to
do
it
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
*NL*
am
sure
I
should
not
have
suffered
any
fellows
to
_
include
_
themselves
*NL*
into
gentlemen
's
company
;
but
I
thoft
he
had
been
an
officer
himself
,
*NL*
till
the
serjeant
told
me
he
was
but
a
recruit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Landlady
,
''
answered
the
lieutenant
,
``
you
mistake
the
whole
matter
.
*NL*
The
young
man
behaved
himself
extremely
well
,
and
is
,
I
believe
,
a
*NL*
much
better
gentleman
than
the
ensign
who
abused
him
.
If
the
young
*NL*
fellow
dies
,
the
man
who
struck
him
will
have
most
reason
to
be
sorry
*NL*
for
it
:
for
the
regiment
will
get
rid
of
a
very
troublesome
fellow
,
*NL*
who
is
a
scandal
to
the
army
;
and
if
he
escapes
from
the
hands
of
*NL*
justice
,
blame
me
,
madam
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
ay
!
good
lack-a-day
!
''
said
the
landlady
;
``
who
could
have
thoft
*NL*
it
?
Ay
,
ay
,
ay
,
I
am
satisfied
your
honour
will
see
justice
done
;
and
*NL*
to
be
sure
it
oft
to
be
to
every
one
.
Gentlemen
oft
not
to
kill
poor
*NL*
folks
without
answering
for
it
.
A
poor
man
hath
a
soul
to
be
saved
,
as
*NL*
well
as
his
betters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
said
the
lieutenant
,
``
you
do
the
volunteer
wrong
:
I
*NL*
dare
swear
he
is
more
of
a
gentleman
than
the
officer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
''
cries
the
landlady
;
``
why
,
look
you
there
,
now
:
well
,
my
first
*NL*
husband
was
a
wise
man
;
he
used
to
say
,
you
ca
n't
always
know
the
*NL*
inside
by
the
outside
.
Nay
,
that
might
have
been
well
enough
too
;
for
*NL*
I
never
_
saw
'd
_
him
till
he
was
all
over
blood
.
Who
would
have
thoft
*NL*
it
?
mayhap
,
some
young
gentleman
crossed
in
love
.
Good
lack-a-day
,
if
*NL*
he
should
die
,
what
a
concern
it
will
be
to
his
parents
!
why
,
sure
the
*NL*
devil
must
possess
the
wicked
wretch
to
do
such
an
act
.
To
be
sure
,
he
*NL*
is
a
scandal
to
the
army
,
as
your
honour
says
;
for
most
of
the
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
army
that
ever
I
saw
,
are
quite
different
sort
of
*NL*
people
,
and
look
as
if
they
would
scorn
to
spill
any
Christian
blood
*NL*
as
much
as
any
men
:
I
mean
,
that
is
,
in
a
civil
way
,
as
my
first
*NL*
husband
used
to
say
.
To
be
sure
,
when
they
come
into
the
wars
,
there
*NL*
must
be
bloodshed
:
but
that
they
are
not
to
be
blamed
for
.
The
more
of
*NL*
our
enemies
they
kill
there
,
the
better
:
and
I
wish
,
with
all
my
*NL*
heart
,
they
could
kill
every
mother
's
son
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
fie
,
madam
!
''
said
the
lieutenant
,
smiling
;
''
_
all
_
is
rather
too
*NL*
bloody-minded
a
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
sir
,
''
answered
she
;
``
I
am
not
at
all
bloody-minded
,
only
*NL*
to
our
enemies
;
and
there
is
no
harm
in
that
.
To
be
sure
it
is
natural
*NL*
for
us
to
wish
our
enemies
dead
,
that
the
wars
may
be
at
an
end
,
and
*NL*
our
taxes
be
lowered
;
for
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
pay
as
we
do
.
Why
*NL*
now
,
there
is
above
forty
shillings
for
window-lights
,
and
yet
we
have
*NL*
stopt
up
all
we
could
;
we
have
almost
blinded
the
house
,
I
am
sure
.
*NL*
Says
I
to
the
exciseman
,
says
I
,
I
think
you
oft
to
favour
us
;
I
am
*NL*
sure
we
are
very
good
friends
to
the
government
:
and
so
we
are
for
*NL*
sartain
,
for
we
pay
a
mint
of
money
to
`
um
.
And
yet
I
often
think
to
*NL*
myself
the
government
doth
not
imagine
itself
more
obliged
to
us
,
than
*NL*
to
those
that
do
n't
pay
`
um
a
farthing
.
Ay
,
ay
,
it
is
the
way
of
the
*NL*
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
proceeding
in
this
manner
when
the
surgeon
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
The
lieutenant
immediately
asked
how
his
patient
did
.
But
he
resolved
*NL*
him
only
by
saying
,
``
Better
,
I
believe
,
than
he
would
have
been
by
*NL*
this
time
,
if
I
had
not
been
called
;
and
even
as
it
is
,
perhaps
it
*NL*
would
have
been
lucky
if
I
could
have
been
called
sooner
.
''
--
``
I
hope
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
said
the
lieutenant
,
``
the
skull
is
not
fractured
.
''
--
``
Hum
,
''
cries
*NL*
the
surgeon
:
``
fractures
are
not
always
the
most
dangerous
symptoms
.
*NL*
Contusions
and
lacerations
are
often
attended
with
worse
phaenomena
,
*NL*
and
with
more
fatal
consequences
,
than
fractures
.
People
who
know
*NL*
nothing
of
the
matter
conclude
,
if
the
skull
is
not
fractured
,
all
is
*NL*
well
;
whereas
,
I
had
rather
see
a
man
's
skull
broke
all
to
pieces
,
*NL*
than
some
contusions
I
have
met
with
.
''
--
``
I
hope
,
''
says
the
lieutenant
,
*NL*
``
there
are
no
such
symptoms
here
.
''
--
``
Symptoms
,
''
answered
the
surgeon
,
*NL*
``
are
not
always
regular
nor
constant
.
I
have
known
very
unfavourable
*NL*
symptoms
in
the
morning
change
to
favourable
ones
at
noon
,
and
return
*NL*
to
unfavourable
again
at
night
.
Of
wounds
,
indeed
,
it
is
rightly
and
*NL*
truly
said
,
_
Nemo
repente
fuit
turpissimus
_
.
I
was
once
,
I
remember
,
*NL*
called
to
a
patient
who
had
received
a
violent
contusion
in
his
tibia
,
*NL*
by
which
the
exterior
cutis
was
lacerated
,
so
that
there
was
a
profuse
*NL*
sanguinary
discharge
;
and
the
interior
membranes
were
so
divellicated
,
*NL*
that
the
os
or
bone
very
plainly
appeared
through
the
aperture
of
the
*NL*
vulnus
or
wound
.
Some
febrile
symptoms
intervening
at
the
same
time
*NL*
-LRB-
for
the
pulse
was
exuberant
and
indicated
much
phlebotomy
-RRB-
,
I
*NL*
apprehended
an
immediate
mortification
.
To
prevent
which
,
I
presently
*NL*
made
a
large
orifice
in
the
vein
of
the
left
arm
,
whence
I
drew
twenty
*NL*
ounces
of
blood
;
which
I
expected
to
have
found
extremely
sizy
and
*NL*
glutinous
,
or
indeed
coagulated
,
as
it
is
in
pleuretic
complaints
;
*NL*
but
,
to
my
surprize
,
it
appeared
rosy
and
florid
,
and
its
consistency
*NL*
differed
little
from
the
blood
of
those
in
perfect
health
.
I
then
*NL*
applied
a
fomentation
to
the
part
,
which
highly
answered
the
*NL*
intention
;
and
after
three
or
four
times
dressing
,
the
wound
began
to
*NL*
discharge
a
thick
pus
or
matter
,
by
which
means
the
cohesion
--
But
*NL*
perhaps
I
do
not
make
myself
perfectly
well
understood
?
''
--
``
No
,
*NL*
really
,
''
answered
the
lieutenant
,
``
I
can
not
say
I
understand
a
*NL*
syllable
.
''
--
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
the
surgeon
,
``
then
I
shall
not
tire
your
*NL*
patience
;
in
short
,
within
six
weeks
my
patient
was
able
to
walk
upon
*NL*
his
legs
as
perfectly
as
he
could
have
done
before
he
received
the
*NL*
contusion
.
''
--
``
I
wish
,
sir
,
''
said
the
lieutenant
,
``
you
would
be
so
kind
*NL*
only
to
inform
me
,
whether
the
wound
this
young
gentleman
hath
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
receive
,
is
likely
to
prove
mortal
.
''
--
``
Sir
,
''
answered
*NL*
the
surgeon
,
``
to
say
whether
a
wound
will
prove
mortal
or
not
at
first
*NL*
dressing
,
would
be
very
weak
and
foolish
presumption
:
we
are
all
*NL*
mortal
,
and
symptoms
often
occur
in
a
cure
which
the
greatest
of
our
*NL*
profession
could
never
foresee
.
''
--
``
But
do
you
think
him
in
danger
?
''
*NL*
says
the
other
.
--
``
In
danger
!
ay
,
surely
,
''
cries
the
doctor
:
``
who
is
*NL*
there
among
us
,
who
,
in
the
most
perfect
health
,
can
be
said
not
to
be
*NL*
in
danger
?
Can
a
man
,
therefore
,
with
so
bad
a
wound
as
this
be
said
*NL*
to
be
out
of
danger
?
All
I
can
say
at
present
is
,
that
it
is
well
I
*NL*
was
called
as
I
was
,
and
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
I
had
*NL*
been
called
sooner
.
I
will
see
him
again
early
in
the
morning
;
and
in
*NL*
the
meantime
let
him
be
kept
extremely
quiet
,
and
drink
liberally
of
*NL*
water-gruel
.
''
--
``
Wo
n't
you
allow
him
sack-whey
?
''
said
the
*NL*
landlady
.
--
``
Ay
,
ay
,
sack-whey
,
''
cries
the
doctor
,
``
if
you
will
,
*NL*
provided
it
be
very
small
.
''
--
``
And
a
little
chicken
broth
too
?
''
added
*NL*
she
.
--
``
Yes
,
yes
,
chicken
broth
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
is
very
*NL*
good
.
''
--
``
May
n't
I
make
him
some
jellies
too
?
''
said
the
landlady
.
--
``
Ay
,
*NL*
ay
,
''
answered
the
doctor
,
``
jellies
are
very
good
for
wounds
,
for
they
*NL*
promote
cohesion
.
''
And
indeed
it
was
lucky
she
had
not
named
soup
or
*NL*
high
sauces
,
for
the
doctor
would
have
complied
,
rather
than
have
lost
*NL*
the
custom
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
was
no
sooner
gone
,
than
the
landlady
began
to
trumpet
*NL*
forth
his
fame
to
the
lieutenant
,
who
had
not
,
from
their
short
*NL*
acquaintance
,
conceived
quite
so
favourable
an
opinion
of
his
physical
*NL*
abilities
as
the
good
woman
,
and
all
the
neighbourhood
,
entertained
*NL*
-LRB-
and
perhaps
very
rightly
-RRB-
;
for
though
I
am
afraid
the
doctor
was
a
*NL*
little
of
a
coxcomb
,
he
might
be
nevertheless
very
much
of
a
surgeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
having
collected
from
the
learned
discourse
of
the
*NL*
surgeon
that
Mr
Jones
was
in
great
danger
,
gave
orders
for
keeping
Mr
*NL*
Northerton
under
a
very
strict
guard
,
designing
in
the
morning
to
*NL*
attend
him
to
a
justice
of
peace
,
and
to
commit
the
conducting
the
*NL*
troops
to
Gloucester
to
the
French
lieutenant
,
who
,
though
he
could
*NL*
neither
read
,
write
,
nor
speak
any
language
,
was
,
however
,
a
good
*NL*
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
our
commander
sent
a
message
to
Mr
Jones
,
that
if
a
*NL*
visit
would
not
be
troublesome
,
he
would
wait
on
him
.
This
civility
*NL*
was
very
kindly
and
thankfully
received
by
Jones
,
and
the
lieutenant
*NL*
accordingly
went
up
to
his
room
,
where
he
found
the
wounded
man
much
*NL*
better
than
he
expected
;
nay
,
Jones
assured
his
friend
,
that
if
he
had
*NL*
not
received
express
orders
to
the
contrary
from
the
surgeon
,
he
*NL*
should
have
got
up
long
ago
;
for
he
appeared
to
himself
to
be
as
well
*NL*
as
ever
,
and
felt
no
other
inconvenience
from
his
wound
but
an
extreme
*NL*
soreness
on
that
side
of
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
glad
,
''
quoth
the
lieutenant
,
``
if
you
was
as
well
as
*NL*
you
fancy
yourself
,
for
then
you
could
be
able
to
do
yourself
justice
*NL*
immediately
;
for
when
a
matter
ca
n't
be
made
up
,
as
in
case
of
a
blow
,
*NL*
the
sooner
you
take
him
out
the
better
;
but
I
am
afraid
you
think
*NL*
yourself
better
than
you
are
,
and
he
would
have
too
much
advantage
*NL*
over
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
,
however
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
if
you
please
,
and
will
be
so
*NL*
kind
to
lend
me
a
sword
,
for
I
have
none
here
of
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sword
is
heartily
at
your
service
,
my
dear
boy
,
''
cries
the
*NL*
lieutenant
,
kissing
him
;
``
you
are
a
brave
lad
,
and
I
love
your
spirit
;
*NL*
but
I
fear
your
strength
;
for
such
a
blow
,
and
so
much
loss
of
blood
,
*NL*
must
have
very
much
weakened
you
;
and
though
you
feel
no
want
of
*NL*
strength
in
your
bed
,
yet
you
most
probably
would
after
a
thrust
or
*NL*
two
.
I
ca
n't
consent
to
your
taking
him
out
tonight
;
but
I
hope
you
*NL*
will
be
able
to
come
up
with
us
before
we
get
many
days
'
march
*NL*
advance
;
and
I
give
you
my
honour
you
shall
have
satisfaction
,
or
the
*NL*
man
who
hath
injured
you
sha
n't
stay
in
our
regiment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
it
was
possible
to
decide
this
matter
to-night
:
*NL*
now
you
have
mentioned
it
to
me
,
I
shall
not
be
able
to
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
never
think
of
it
,
''
returned
the
other
:
``
a
few
days
will
make
no
*NL*
difference
.
The
wounds
of
honour
are
not
like
those
in
your
body
:
they
*NL*
suffer
nothing
by
the
delay
of
cure
.
It
will
be
altogether
as
well
for
*NL*
you
to
receive
satisfaction
a
week
hence
as
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
suppose
,
''
says
Jones
,
``
I
should
grow
worse
,
and
die
of
the
*NL*
consequences
of
my
present
wound
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
your
honour
,
''
answered
the
lieutenant
,
``
will
require
no
*NL*
reparation
at
all
.
I
myself
will
do
justice
to
your
character
,
and
*NL*
testify
to
the
world
your
intention
to
have
acted
properly
,
if
you
had
*NL*
recovered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
replied
Jones
,
``
I
am
concerned
at
the
delay
.
I
am
almost
*NL*
afraid
to
mention
it
to
you
who
are
a
soldier
;
but
though
I
have
been
*NL*
a
very
wild
young
fellow
,
still
in
my
most
serious
moments
,
and
at
the
*NL*
bottom
,
I
am
really
a
Christian
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I
too
,
I
assure
you
,
''
said
the
officer
;
``
and
so
zealous
a
one
,
*NL*
that
I
was
pleased
with
you
at
dinner
for
taking
up
the
cause
of
your
*NL*
religion
;
and
I
am
a
little
offended
with
you
now
,
young
gentleman
,
*NL*
that
you
should
express
a
fear
of
declaring
your
faith
before
any
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
terrible
must
it
be
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
to
any
one
who
is
really
*NL*
a
Christian
,
to
cherish
malice
in
his
breast
,
in
opposition
to
the
*NL*
command
of
Him
who
hath
expressly
forbid
it
?
How
can
I
bear
to
do
this
*NL*
on
a
sick-bed
?
Or
how
shall
I
make
up
my
account
,
with
such
an
article
*NL*
as
this
in
my
bosom
against
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
believe
there
is
such
a
command
,
''
cries
the
lieutenant
;
``
but
a
*NL*
man
of
honour
ca
n't
keep
it
.
And
you
must
be
a
man
of
honour
,
if
you
*NL*
will
be
in
the
army
.
I
remember
I
once
put
the
case
to
our
chaplain
*NL*
over
a
bowl
of
punch
,
and
he
confessed
there
was
much
difficulty
in
*NL*
it
;
but
he
said
,
he
hoped
there
might
be
a
latitude
granted
to
*NL*
soldiers
in
this
one
instance
;
and
to
be
sure
it
is
our
duty
to
hope
*NL*
so
;
for
who
would
bear
to
live
without
his
honour
?
No
,
no
,
my
dear
*NL*
boy
,
be
a
good
Christian
as
long
as
you
live
;
but
be
a
man
of
honour
*NL*
too
,
and
never
put
up
an
affront
;
not
all
the
books
,
nor
all
the
*NL*
parsons
in
the
world
,
shall
ever
persuade
me
to
that
.
I
love
my
*NL*
religion
very
well
,
but
I
love
my
honour
more
.
There
must
be
some
*NL*
mistake
in
the
wording
the
text
,
or
in
the
translation
,
or
in
the
*NL*
understanding
it
,
or
somewhere
or
other
.
But
however
that
be
,
a
man
*NL*
must
run
the
risque
,
for
he
must
preserve
his
honour
.
So
compose
*NL*
yourself
to-night
,
and
I
promise
you
you
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
doing
yourself
justice
.
''
Here
he
gave
Jones
a
hearty
buss
,
shook
him
*NL*
by
the
hand
,
and
took
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
the
lieutenant
's
reasoning
was
very
satisfactory
to
*NL*
himself
,
it
was
not
entirely
so
to
his
friend
.
Jones
therefore
,
having
*NL*
revolved
this
matter
much
in
his
thoughts
,
at
last
came
to
a
*NL*
resolution
,
which
the
reader
will
find
in
the
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
xiv
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
most
dreadful
chapter
indeed
;
and
which
few
readers
ought
to
venture
*NL*
upon
in
an
evening
,
especially
when
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
swallowed
a
large
mess
of
chicken
,
or
rather
cock
,
broth
,
with
a
*NL*
very
good
appetite
,
as
indeed
he
would
have
done
the
cock
it
was
made
*NL*
of
,
with
a
pound
of
bacon
into
the
bargain
;
and
now
,
finding
in
*NL*
himself
no
deficiency
of
either
health
or
spirit
,
he
resolved
to
get
*NL*
up
and
seek
his
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
first
he
sent
for
the
serjeant
,
who
was
his
first
acquaintance
*NL*
among
these
military
gentlemen
.
Unluckily
that
worthy
officer
having
,
*NL*
in
a
literal
sense
,
taken
his
fill
of
liquor
,
had
been
some
time
*NL*
retired
to
his
bolster
,
where
he
was
snoring
so
loud
that
it
was
not
*NL*
easy
to
convey
a
noise
in
at
his
ears
capable
of
drowning
that
which
*NL*
issued
from
his
nostrils
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
Jones
persisted
in
his
desire
of
seeing
him
,
a
vociferous
*NL*
drawer
at
length
found
means
to
disturb
his
slumbers
,
and
to
acquaint
*NL*
him
with
the
message
.
Of
which
the
serjeant
was
no
sooner
made
*NL*
sensible
,
than
he
arose
from
his
bed
,
and
having
his
clothes
already
*NL*
on
,
immediately
attended
.
Jones
did
not
think
fit
to
acquaint
the
*NL*
serjeant
with
his
design
;
though
he
might
have
done
it
with
great
*NL*
safety
,
for
the
halberdier
was
himself
a
man
of
honour
,
and
had
killed
*NL*
his
man
.
He
would
therefore
have
faithfully
kept
this
secret
,
or
*NL*
indeed
any
other
which
no
reward
was
published
for
discovering
.
But
as
*NL*
Jones
knew
not
those
virtues
in
so
short
an
acquaintance
,
his
caution
*NL*
was
perhaps
prudent
and
commendable
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
therefore
by
acquainting
the
serjeant
,
that
as
he
was
now
*NL*
entered
into
the
army
,
he
was
ashamed
of
being
without
what
was
*NL*
perhaps
the
most
necessary
implement
of
a
soldier
;
namely
,
a
sword
;
*NL*
adding
,
that
he
should
be
infinitely
obliged
to
him
,
if
he
could
*NL*
procure
one
.
``
For
which
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
will
give
you
any
reasonable
*NL*
price
;
nor
do
I
insist
upon
its
being
silver-hilted
;
only
a
good
*NL*
blade
,
and
such
as
may
become
a
soldier
's
thigh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
serjeant
,
who
well
knew
what
had
happened
,
and
had
heard
that
*NL*
Jones
was
in
a
very
dangerous
condition
,
immediately
concluded
,
from
*NL*
such
a
message
,
at
such
a
time
of
night
,
and
from
a
man
in
such
a
*NL*
situation
,
that
he
was
light-headed
.
Now
as
he
had
his
wit
-LRB-
to
use
*NL*
that
word
in
its
common
signification
-RRB-
always
ready
,
he
bethought
*NL*
himself
of
making
his
advantage
of
this
humour
in
the
sick
man
.
``
Sir
,
''
*NL*
says
he
,
``
I
believe
I
can
fit
you
.
I
have
a
most
excellent
piece
of
*NL*
stuff
by
me
.
It
is
not
indeed
silver-hilted
,
which
,
as
you
say
,
doth
*NL*
not
become
a
soldier
;
but
the
handle
is
decent
enough
,
and
the
blade
*NL*
one
of
the
best
in
Europe
.
It
is
a
blade
that
--
a
blade
that
--
in
short
,
*NL*
I
will
fetch
it
you
this
instant
,
and
you
shall
see
it
and
handle
it
.
*NL*
I
am
glad
to
see
your
honour
so
well
with
all
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Being
instantly
returned
with
the
sword
,
he
delivered
it
to
Jones
,
who
*NL*
took
it
and
drew
it
;
and
then
told
the
serjeant
it
would
do
very
well
,
*NL*
and
bid
him
name
his
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
serjeant
now
began
to
harangue
in
praise
of
his
goods
.
He
said
*NL*
-LRB-
nay
he
swore
very
heartily
-RRB-
,
``
that
the
blade
was
taken
from
a
French
*NL*
officer
,
of
very
high
rank
,
at
the
battle
of
Dettingen
.
I
took
it
*NL*
myself
,
''
says
he
,
``
from
his
side
,
after
I
had
knocked
him
o
'
the
head
.
*NL*
The
hilt
was
a
golden
one
.
That
I
sold
to
one
of
our
fine
gentlemen
;
*NL*
for
there
are
some
of
them
,
a
n't
please
your
honour
,
who
value
the
*NL*
hilt
of
a
sword
more
than
the
blade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
other
stopped
him
,
and
begged
him
to
name
a
price
.
The
*NL*
serjeant
,
who
thought
Jones
absolutely
out
of
his
senses
,
and
very
*NL*
near
his
end
,
was
afraid
lest
he
should
injure
his
family
by
asking
*NL*
too
little
.
However
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
he
contented
himself
*NL*
with
naming
twenty
guineas
,
and
swore
he
would
not
sell
it
for
less
to
*NL*
his
own
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
guineas
!
''
says
Jones
,
in
the
utmost
surprize
:
``
sure
you
think
*NL*
I
am
mad
,
or
that
I
never
saw
a
sword
in
my
life
.
Twenty
guineas
,
*NL*
indeed
!
I
did
not
imagine
you
would
endeavour
to
impose
upon
me
.
Here
,
*NL*
take
the
sword
--
No
,
now
I
think
o
n't
,
I
will
keep
it
myself
,
and
show
*NL*
it
your
officer
in
the
morning
,
acquainting
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
what
a
price
you
asked
me
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
serjeant
,
as
we
have
said
,
had
always
his
wit
-LRB-
_
in
sensu
*NL*
praedicto
_
-RRB-
about
him
,
and
now
plainly
saw
that
Jones
was
not
in
the
*NL*
condition
he
had
apprehended
him
to
be
;
he
now
,
therefore
,
*NL*
counterfeited
as
great
surprize
as
the
other
had
shown
,
and
said
,
``
I
*NL*
am
certain
,
sir
,
I
have
not
asked
you
so
much
out
of
the
way
.
Besides
,
*NL*
you
are
to
consider
,
it
is
the
only
sword
I
have
,
and
I
must
run
the
*NL*
risque
of
my
officer
's
displeasure
,
by
going
without
one
myself
.
And
*NL*
truly
,
putting
all
this
together
,
I
do
n't
think
twenty
shillings
was
*NL*
so
much
out
of
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
shillings
!
''
cries
Jones
;
``
why
,
you
just
now
asked
me
twenty
*NL*
guineas
.
''
--
``
How
!
''
cries
the
serjeant
,
``
sure
your
honour
must
have
*NL*
mistaken
me
:
or
else
I
mistook
myself
--
and
indeed
I
am
but
half
awake
.
*NL*
Twenty
guineas
,
indeed
!
no
wonder
your
honour
flew
into
such
a
*NL*
passion
.
I
say
twenty
guineas
too
.
No
,
no
,
I
mean
twenty
shillings
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
.
And
when
your
honour
comes
to
consider
everything
,
I
hope
*NL*
you
will
not
think
that
so
extravagant
a
price
.
It
is
indeed
true
,
you
*NL*
may
buy
a
weapon
which
looks
as
well
for
less
money
.
But
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Jones
interrupted
him
,
saying
,
``
I
will
be
so
far
from
making
any
*NL*
words
with
you
,
that
I
will
give
you
a
shilling
more
than
your
*NL*
demand
.
''
He
then
gave
him
a
guinea
,
bid
him
return
to
his
bed
,
and
*NL*
wished
him
a
good
march
;
adding
,
he
hoped
to
overtake
them
before
the
*NL*
division
reached
Worcester
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
serjeant
very
civilly
took
his
leave
,
fully
satisfied
with
his
*NL*
merchandize
,
and
not
a
little
pleased
with
his
dexterous
recovery
from
*NL*
that
false
step
into
which
his
opinion
of
the
sick
man
's
*NL*
light-headedness
had
betrayed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
serjeant
was
departed
,
Jones
rose
from
his
bed
,
and
*NL*
dressed
himself
entirely
,
putting
on
even
his
coat
,
which
,
as
its
*NL*
colour
was
white
,
showed
very
visibly
the
streams
of
blood
which
had
*NL*
flowed
down
it
;
and
now
,
having
grasped
his
new-purchased
sword
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
he
was
going
to
issue
forth
,
when
the
thought
of
what
he
was
*NL*
about
to
undertake
laid
suddenly
hold
of
him
,
and
he
began
to
reflect
*NL*
that
in
a
few
minutes
he
might
possibly
deprive
a
human
being
of
life
,
*NL*
or
might
lose
his
own
.
``
Very
well
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
in
what
cause
do
I
*NL*
venture
my
life
?
Why
,
in
that
of
my
honour
.
And
who
is
this
human
*NL*
being
?
A
rascal
who
hath
injured
and
insulted
me
without
provocation
.
*NL*
But
is
not
revenge
forbidden
by
Heaven
?
Yes
,
but
it
is
enjoined
by
the
*NL*
world
.
Well
,
but
shall
I
obey
the
world
in
opposition
to
the
express
*NL*
commands
of
Heaven
?
Shall
I
incur
the
Divine
displeasure
rather
than
*NL*
be
called
--
ha
--
coward
--
scoundrel
?
--
I
'll
think
no
more
;
I
am
resolved
,
*NL*
and
must
fight
him
.

The
clock
had
now
struck
twelve
,
and
every
one
in
the
house
were
in
*NL*
their
beds
,
except
the
centinel
who
stood
to
guard
Northerton
,
when
*NL*
Jones
softly
opening
his
door
,
issued
forth
in
pursuit
of
his
enemy
,
*NL*
of
whose
place
of
confinement
he
had
received
a
perfect
description
*NL*
from
the
drawer
.
It
is
not
easy
to
conceive
a
much
more
tremendous
*NL*
figure
than
he
now
exhibited
.
He
had
on
,
as
we
have
said
,
a
*NL*
light-coloured
coat
,
covered
with
streams
of
blood
.
His
face
,
which
*NL*
missed
that
very
blood
,
as
well
as
twenty
ounces
more
drawn
from
him
*NL*
by
the
surgeon
,
was
pallid
.
Round
his
head
was
a
quantity
of
bandage
,
*NL*
not
unlike
a
turban
.
In
the
right
hand
he
carried
a
sword
,
and
in
the
*NL*
left
a
candle
.
So
that
the
bloody
Banquo
was
not
worthy
to
be
compared
*NL*
to
him
.
In
fact
,
I
believe
a
more
dreadful
apparition
was
never
raised
*NL*
in
a
church-yard
,
nor
in
the
imagination
of
any
good
people
met
in
a
*NL*
winter
evening
over
a
Christmas
fire
in
Somersetshire
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
centinel
first
saw
our
heroe
approach
,
his
hair
began
gently
*NL*
to
lift
up
his
grenadier
cap
;
and
in
the
same
instant
his
knees
fell
*NL*
to
blows
with
each
other
.
Presently
his
whole
body
was
seized
with
*NL*
worse
than
an
ague
fit
.
He
then
fired
his
piece
,
and
fell
flat
on
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
fear
or
courage
was
the
occasion
of
his
firing
,
or
whether
he
*NL*
took
aim
at
the
object
of
his
terror
,
I
can
not
say
.
If
he
did
,
*NL*
however
,
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
miss
his
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
seeing
the
fellow
fall
,
guessed
the
cause
of
his
fright
,
at
*NL*
which
he
could
not
forbear
smiling
,
not
in
the
least
reflecting
on
the
*NL*
danger
from
which
he
had
just
escaped
.
He
then
passed
by
the
fellow
,
*NL*
who
still
continued
in
the
posture
in
which
he
fell
,
and
entered
the
*NL*
room
where
Northerton
,
as
he
had
heard
,
was
confined
.
Here
,
in
a
*NL*
solitary
situation
,
he
found
--
an
empty
quart
pot
standing
on
the
*NL*
table
,
on
which
some
beer
being
spilt
,
it
looked
as
if
the
room
had
*NL*
lately
been
inhabited
;
but
at
present
it
was
entirely
vacant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
then
apprehended
it
might
lead
to
some
other
apartment
;
but
upon
*NL*
searching
all
round
it
,
he
could
perceive
no
other
door
than
that
at
*NL*
which
he
entered
,
and
where
the
centinel
had
been
posted
.
He
then
*NL*
proceeded
to
call
Northerton
several
times
by
his
name
;
but
no
one
*NL*
answered
;
nor
did
this
serve
to
any
other
purpose
than
to
confirm
the
*NL*
centinel
in
his
terrors
,
who
was
now
convinced
that
the
volunteer
was
*NL*
dead
of
his
wounds
,
and
that
his
ghost
was
come
in
search
of
the
*NL*
murderer
:
he
now
lay
in
all
the
agonies
of
horror
;
and
I
wish
,
with
*NL*
all
my
heart
,
some
of
those
actors
who
are
hereafter
to
represent
a
*NL*
man
frighted
out
of
his
wits
had
seen
him
,
that
they
might
be
taught
*NL*
to
copy
nature
,
instead
of
performing
several
antic
tricks
and
*NL*
gestures
,
for
the
entertainment
and
applause
of
the
galleries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perceiving
the
bird
was
flown
,
at
least
despairing
to
find
him
,
and
*NL*
rightly
apprehending
that
the
report
of
the
firelock
would
alarm
the
*NL*
whole
house
,
our
heroe
now
blew
out
his
candle
,
and
gently
stole
back
*NL*
again
to
his
chamber
,
and
to
his
bed
;
whither
he
would
not
have
been
*NL*
able
to
have
gotten
undiscovered
,
had
any
other
person
been
on
the
*NL*
same
staircase
,
save
only
one
gentleman
who
was
confined
to
his
bed
by
*NL*
the
gout
;
for
before
he
could
reach
the
door
to
his
chamber
,
the
hall
*NL*
where
the
centinel
had
been
posted
was
half
full
of
people
,
some
in
*NL*
their
shirts
,
and
others
not
half
drest
,
all
very
earnestly
enquiring
*NL*
of
each
other
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
was
now
found
lying
in
the
same
place
and
posture
in
which
*NL*
we
just
now
left
him
.
Several
immediately
applied
themselves
to
raise
*NL*
him
,
and
some
concluded
him
dead
;
but
they
presently
saw
their
*NL*
mistake
,
for
he
not
only
struggled
with
those
who
laid
their
hands
on
*NL*
him
,
but
fell
a
roaring
like
a
bull
.
In
reality
,
he
imagined
so
many
*NL*
spirits
or
devils
were
handling
him
;
for
his
imagination
being
*NL*
possessed
with
the
horror
of
an
apparition
,
converted
every
object
he
*NL*
saw
or
felt
into
nothing
but
ghosts
and
spectres
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
was
overpowered
by
numbers
,
and
got
upon
his
legs
;
when
*NL*
candles
being
brought
,
and
seeing
two
or
three
of
his
comrades
*NL*
present
,
he
came
a
little
to
himself
;
but
when
they
asked
him
what
was
*NL*
the
matter
?
he
answered
,
``
I
am
a
dead
man
,
that
's
all
,
I
am
a
dead
*NL*
man
,
I
ca
n't
recover
it
,
I
have
seen
him
.
''
``
What
hast
thou
seen
,
*NL*
Jack
?
''
says
one
of
the
soldiers
.
``
Why
,
I
have
seen
the
young
volunteer
*NL*
that
was
killed
yesterday
.
''
He
then
imprecated
the
most
heavy
curses
*NL*
on
himself
,
if
he
had
not
seen
the
volunteer
,
all
over
blood
,
vomiting
*NL*
fire
out
of
his
mouth
and
nostrils
,
pass
by
him
into
the
chamber
where
*NL*
Ensign
Northerton
was
,
and
then
seizing
the
ensign
by
the
throat
,
fly
*NL*
away
with
him
in
a
clap
of
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
relation
met
with
a
gracious
reception
from
the
audience
.
All
the
*NL*
women
present
believed
it
firmly
,
and
prayed
Heaven
to
defend
them
*NL*
from
murder
.
Amongst
the
men
too
,
many
had
faith
in
the
story
;
but
*NL*
others
turned
it
into
derision
and
ridicule
;
and
a
serjeant
who
was
*NL*
present
answered
very
coolly
,
``
Young
man
,
you
will
hear
more
of
this
,
*NL*
for
going
to
sleep
and
dreaming
on
your
post
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldier
replied
,
``
You
may
punish
me
if
you
please
;
but
I
was
as
*NL*
broad
awake
as
I
am
now
;
and
the
devil
carry
me
away
,
as
he
hath
the
*NL*
ensign
,
if
I
did
not
see
the
dead
man
,
as
I
tell
you
,
with
eyes
as
big
*NL*
and
as
fiery
as
two
large
flambeaux
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
commander
of
the
forces
,
and
the
commander
of
the
house
,
were
now
*NL*
both
arrived
;
for
the
former
being
awake
at
the
time
,
and
hearing
the
*NL*
centinel
fire
his
piece
,
thought
it
his
duty
to
rise
immediately
,
*NL*
though
he
had
no
great
apprehensions
of
any
mischief
;
whereas
the
*NL*
apprehensions
of
the
latter
were
much
greater
,
lest
her
spoons
and
*NL*
tankards
should
be
upon
the
march
,
without
having
received
any
such
*NL*
orders
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
poor
centinel
,
to
whom
the
sight
of
this
officer
was
not
much
more
*NL*
welcome
than
the
apparition
,
as
he
thought
it
,
which
he
had
seen
*NL*
before
,
again
related
the
dreadful
story
,
and
with
many
additions
of
*NL*
blood
and
fire
;
but
he
had
the
misfortune
to
gain
no
credit
with
*NL*
either
of
the
last-mentioned
persons
:
for
the
officer
,
though
a
very
*NL*
religious
man
,
was
free
from
all
terrors
of
this
kind
;
besides
,
having
*NL*
so
lately
left
Jones
in
the
condition
we
have
seen
,
he
had
no
*NL*
suspicion
of
his
being
dead
.
As
for
the
landlady
,
though
not
over
*NL*
religious
,
she
had
no
kind
of
aversion
to
the
doctrine
of
spirits
;
but
*NL*
there
was
a
circumstance
in
the
tale
which
she
well
knew
to
be
false
,
*NL*
as
we
shall
inform
the
reader
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whether
Northerton
was
carried
away
in
thunder
or
fire
,
or
in
*NL*
whatever
other
manner
he
was
gone
,
it
was
now
certain
that
his
body
*NL*
was
no
longer
in
custody
.
Upon
this
occasion
the
lieutenant
formed
a
*NL*
conclusion
not
very
different
from
what
the
serjeant
is
just
mentioned
*NL*
to
have
made
before
,
and
immediately
ordered
the
centinel
to
be
taken
*NL*
prisoner
.
So
that
,
by
a
strange
reverse
of
fortune
-LRB-
though
not
very
*NL*
uncommon
in
a
military
life
-RRB-
,
the
guard
became
the
guarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
xv
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conclusion
of
the
foregoing
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
suspicion
of
sleep
,
the
lieutenant
harboured
another
and
*NL*
worse
doubt
against
the
poor
centinel
,
and
this
was
,
that
of
*NL*
treachery
;
for
as
he
believed
not
one
syllable
of
the
apparition
,
so
*NL*
he
imagined
the
whole
to
be
an
invention
formed
only
to
impose
upon
*NL*
him
,
and
that
the
fellow
had
in
reality
been
bribed
by
Northerton
to
*NL*
let
him
escape
.
And
this
he
imagined
the
rather
,
as
the
fright
*NL*
appeared
to
him
the
more
unnatural
in
one
who
had
the
character
of
as
*NL*
brave
and
bold
a
man
as
any
in
the
regiment
,
having
been
in
several
*NL*
actions
,
having
received
several
wounds
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
having
*NL*
behaved
himself
always
like
a
good
and
valiant
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
reader
,
therefore
,
may
not
conceive
the
least
ill
opinion
of
*NL*
such
a
person
,
we
shall
not
delay
a
moment
in
rescuing
his
character
*NL*
from
the
imputation
of
this
guilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Northerton
then
,
as
we
have
before
observed
,
was
fully
satisfied
*NL*
with
the
glory
which
he
had
obtained
from
this
action
.
He
had
perhaps
*NL*
seen
,
or
heard
,
or
guessed
,
that
envy
is
apt
to
attend
fame
.
Not
that
*NL*
I
would
here
insinuate
that
he
was
heathenishly
inclined
to
believe
in
*NL*
or
to
worship
the
goddess
Nemesis
;
for
,
in
fact
,
I
am
convinced
he
*NL*
never
heard
of
her
name
.
He
was
,
besides
,
of
an
active
disposition
,
*NL*
and
had
a
great
antipathy
to
those
close
quarters
in
the
castle
of
*NL*
Gloucester
,
for
which
a
justice
of
peace
might
possibly
give
him
a
*NL*
billet
.
Nor
was
he
moreover
free
from
some
uneasy
meditations
on
a
*NL*
certain
wooden
edifice
,
which
I
forbear
to
name
,
in
conformity
to
the
*NL*
opinion
of
mankind
,
who
,
I
think
,
rather
ought
to
honour
than
to
be
*NL*
ashamed
of
this
building
,
as
it
is
,
or
at
least
might
be
made
,
of
more
*NL*
benefit
to
society
than
almost
any
other
public
erection
.
In
a
word
,
*NL*
to
hint
at
no
more
reasons
for
his
conduct
,
Mr
Northerton
was
desirous
*NL*
of
departing
that
evening
,
and
nothing
remained
for
him
but
to
*NL*
contrive
the
quomodo
,
which
appeared
to
be
a
matter
of
some
*NL*
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
young
gentleman
,
though
somewhat
crooked
in
his
morals
,
was
*NL*
perfectly
straight
in
his
person
,
which
was
extremely
strong
and
well
*NL*
made
.
His
face
too
was
accounted
handsome
by
the
generality
of
women
,
*NL*
for
it
was
broad
and
ruddy
,
with
tolerably
good
teeth
.
Such
charms
did
*NL*
not
fail
making
an
impression
on
my
landlady
,
who
had
no
little
relish
*NL*
for
this
kind
of
beauty
.
She
had
,
indeed
,
a
real
compassion
for
the
*NL*
young
man
;
and
hearing
from
the
surgeon
that
affairs
were
like
to
go
*NL*
ill
with
the
volunteer
,
she
suspected
they
might
hereafter
wear
no
*NL*
benign
aspect
with
the
ensign
.
Having
obtained
,
therefore
,
leave
to
*NL*
make
him
a
visit
,
and
finding
him
in
a
very
melancholy
mood
,
which
she
*NL*
considerably
heightened
by
telling
him
there
were
scarce
any
hopes
of
*NL*
the
volunteer
's
life
,
she
proceeded
to
throw
forth
some
hints
,
which
*NL*
the
other
readily
and
eagerly
taking
up
,
they
soon
came
to
a
right
*NL*
understanding
;
and
it
was
at
length
agreed
that
the
ensign
should
,
at
*NL*
a
certain
signal
,
ascend
the
chimney
,
which
communicating
very
soon
*NL*
with
that
of
the
kitchen
,
he
might
there
again
let
himself
down
;
for
*NL*
which
she
would
give
him
an
opportunity
by
keeping
the
coast
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
lest
our
readers
,
of
a
different
complexion
,
should
take
this
*NL*
occasion
of
too
hastily
condemning
all
compassion
as
a
folly
,
and
*NL*
pernicious
to
society
,
we
think
proper
to
mention
another
particular
*NL*
which
might
possibly
have
some
little
share
in
this
action
.
The
ensign
*NL*
happened
to
be
at
this
time
possessed
of
the
sum
of
fifty
pounds
,
*NL*
which
did
indeed
belong
to
the
whole
company
;
for
the
captain
having
*NL*
quarrelled
with
his
lieutenant
,
had
entrusted
the
payment
of
his
*NL*
company
to
the
ensign
.
This
money
,
however
,
he
thought
proper
to
*NL*
deposit
in
my
landlady
's
hand
,
possibly
by
way
of
bail
or
security
*NL*
that
he
would
hereafter
appear
and
answer
to
the
charge
against
him
;
*NL*
but
whatever
were
the
conditions
,
certain
it
is
,
that
she
had
the
*NL*
money
and
the
ensign
his
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
perhaps
expect
,
from
the
compassionate
temper
of
this
*NL*
good
woman
,
that
when
she
saw
the
poor
centinel
taken
prisoner
for
a
*NL*
fact
of
which
she
knew
him
innocent
,
she
should
immediately
have
*NL*
interposed
in
his
behalf
;
but
whether
it
was
that
she
had
already
*NL*
exhausted
all
her
compassion
in
the
above-mentioned
instance
,
or
that
*NL*
the
features
of
this
fellow
,
though
not
very
different
from
those
of
*NL*
the
ensign
,
could
not
raise
it
,
I
will
not
determine
;
but
,
far
from
*NL*
being
an
advocate
for
the
present
prisoner
,
she
urged
his
guilt
to
his
*NL*
officer
,
declaring
,
with
uplifted
eyes
and
hands
,
that
she
would
not
*NL*
have
had
any
concern
in
the
escape
of
a
murderer
for
all
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
now
once
more
quiet
,
and
most
of
the
company
returned
*NL*
again
to
their
beds
;
but
the
landlady
,
either
from
the
natural
*NL*
activity
of
her
disposition
,
or
from
her
fear
for
her
plate
,
having
no
*NL*
propensity
to
sleep
,
prevailed
with
the
officers
,
as
they
were
to
*NL*
march
within
little
more
than
an
hour
,
to
spend
that
time
with
her
*NL*
over
a
bowl
of
punch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
lain
awake
all
this
while
,
and
had
heard
great
part
of
the
*NL*
hurry
and
bustle
that
had
passed
,
of
which
he
had
now
some
curiosity
*NL*
to
know
the
particulars
.
He
therefore
applied
to
his
bell
,
which
he
*NL*
rung
at
least
twenty
times
without
any
effect
:
for
my
landlady
was
in
*NL*
such
high
mirth
with
her
company
,
that
no
clapper
could
be
heard
there
*NL*
but
her
own
;
and
the
drawer
and
chambermaid
,
who
were
sitting
together
*NL*
in
the
kitchen
-LRB-
for
neither
durst
he
sit
up
nor
she
lie
in
bed
alone
-RRB-
,
*NL*
the
more
they
heard
the
bell
ring
the
more
they
were
frightened
,
and
*NL*
as
it
were
nailed
down
in
their
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
at
a
lucky
interval
of
chat
,
the
sound
reached
the
ears
of
*NL*
our
good
landlady
,
who
presently
sent
forth
her
summons
,
which
both
*NL*
her
servants
instantly
obeyed
.
``
Joe
,
''
says
the
mistress
,
``
do
n't
you
*NL*
hear
the
gentleman
's
bell
ring
?
Why
do
n't
you
go
up
?
''
--
``
It
is
not
my
*NL*
business
,
''
answered
the
drawer
,
``
to
wait
upon
the
chambers
--
it
is
*NL*
Betty
Chambermaid
's
.
''
--
``
If
you
come
to
that
,
''
answered
the
maid
,
``
it
*NL*
is
not
my
business
to
wait
upon
gentlemen
.
I
have
done
it
indeed
*NL*
sometimes
;
but
the
devil
fetch
me
if
ever
I
do
again
,
since
you
make
*NL*
your
preambles
about
it
.
''
The
bell
still
ringing
violently
,
their
*NL*
mistress
fell
into
a
passion
,
and
swore
,
if
the
drawer
did
not
go
up
*NL*
immediately
,
she
would
turn
him
away
that
very
morning
.
``
If
you
do
,
*NL*
madam
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
I
wo
n't
do
another
servant
's
*NL*
business
.
''
She
then
applied
herself
to
the
maid
,
and
endeavoured
to
*NL*
prevail
by
gentle
means
;
but
all
in
vain
:
Betty
was
as
inflexible
as
*NL*
Joe
.
Both
insisted
it
was
not
their
business
,
and
they
would
not
do
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
then
fell
a
laughing
,
and
said
,
``
Come
,
I
will
put
an
*NL*
end
to
this
contention
;
''
and
then
turning
to
the
servants
,
commended
*NL*
them
for
their
resolution
in
not
giving
up
the
point
;
but
added
,
he
*NL*
was
sure
,
if
one
would
consent
to
go
the
other
would
.
To
which
*NL*
proposal
they
both
agreed
in
an
instant
,
and
accordingly
went
up
very
*NL*
lovingly
and
close
together
.
When
they
were
gone
,
the
lieutenant
*NL*
appeased
the
wrath
of
the
landlady
,
by
satisfying
her
why
they
were
*NL*
both
so
unwilling
to
go
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
returned
soon
after
,
and
acquainted
their
mistress
,
that
the
sick
*NL*
gentleman
was
so
far
from
being
dead
,
that
he
spoke
as
heartily
as
if
*NL*
he
was
well
;
and
that
he
gave
his
service
to
the
captain
,
and
should
*NL*
be
very
glad
of
the
favour
of
seeing
him
before
he
marched
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
lieutenant
immediately
complied
with
his
desires
,
and
sitting
*NL*
down
by
his
bed-side
,
acquainted
him
with
the
scene
which
had
happened
*NL*
below
,
concluding
with
his
intentions
to
make
an
example
of
the
*NL*
centinel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
this
Jones
related
to
him
the
whole
truth
,
and
earnestly
begged
*NL*
him
not
to
punish
the
poor
soldier
,
``
who
,
I
am
confident
,
''
says
he
,
*NL*
``
is
as
innocent
of
the
ensign
's
escape
,
as
he
is
of
forging
any
lie
,
*NL*
or
of
endeavouring
to
impose
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
hesitated
a
few
moments
,
and
then
answered
:
``
Why
,
as
*NL*
you
have
cleared
the
fellow
of
one
part
of
the
charge
,
so
it
will
be
*NL*
impossible
to
prove
the
other
,
because
he
was
not
the
only
centinel
.
*NL*
But
I
have
a
good
mind
to
punish
the
rascal
for
being
a
coward
.
Yet
*NL*
who
knows
what
effect
the
terror
of
such
an
apprehension
may
have
?
*NL*
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
hath
always
behaved
well
against
an
enemy
.
*NL*
Come
,
it
is
a
good
thing
to
see
any
sign
of
religion
in
these
fellows
;
*NL*
so
I
promise
you
he
shall
be
set
at
liberty
when
we
march
.
But
hark
,
*NL*
the
general
beats
.
My
dear
boy
,
give
me
another
buss
.
Do
n't
discompose
*NL*
nor
hurry
yourself
;
but
remember
the
Christian
doctrine
of
patience
,
*NL*
and
I
warrant
you
will
soon
be
able
to
do
yourself
justice
,
and
to
*NL*
take
an
honourable
revenge
on
the
fellow
who
hath
injured
you
.
''
The
*NL*
lieutenant
then
departed
,
and
Jones
endeavoured
to
compose
himself
to
*NL*
rest
.

BOOK
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
CONTAINING
ABOUT
TWO
DAYS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
wonderful
long
chapter
concerning
the
marvellous
;
being
much
the
*NL*
longest
of
all
our
introductory
chapters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
are
now
entering
upon
a
book
in
which
the
course
of
our
history
*NL*
will
oblige
us
to
relate
some
matters
of
a
more
strange
and
surprizing
*NL*
kind
than
any
which
have
hitherto
occurred
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
,
in
*NL*
the
prolegomenous
or
introductory
chapter
,
to
say
something
of
that
*NL*
species
of
writing
which
is
called
the
marvellous
.
To
this
we
shall
,
*NL*
as
well
for
the
sake
of
ourselves
as
of
others
,
endeavour
to
set
some
*NL*
certain
bounds
,
and
indeed
nothing
can
be
more
necessary
,
as
*NL*
critics
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
of
different
complexions
are
here
apt
to
run
into
very
*NL*
different
extremes
;
for
while
some
are
,
with
M.
Dacier
,
ready
to
*NL*
allow
,
that
the
same
thing
which
is
impossible
may
be
yet
*NL*
probable
,
-LSB-
**
-RSB-
others
have
so
little
historic
or
poetic
faith
,
that
they
*NL*
believe
nothing
to
be
either
possible
or
probable
,
the
like
to
which
*NL*
hath
not
occurred
to
their
own
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
By
this
word
here
,
and
in
most
other
parts
of
our
work
,
we
mean
*NL*
every
reader
in
the
world
.
*NL*
-LSB-
**
-RSB-
It
is
happy
for
M.
Dacier
that
he
was
not
an
Irishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
then
,
I
think
it
may
very
reasonably
be
required
of
every
*NL*
writer
,
that
he
keeps
within
the
bounds
of
possibility
;
and
still
*NL*
remembers
that
what
it
is
not
possible
for
man
to
perform
,
it
is
*NL*
scarce
possible
for
man
to
believe
he
did
perform
.
This
conviction
*NL*
perhaps
gave
birth
to
many
stories
of
the
antient
heathen
deities
-LRB-
for
*NL*
most
of
them
are
of
poetical
original
-RRB-
.
The
poet
,
being
desirous
to
*NL*
indulge
a
wanton
and
extravagant
imagination
,
took
refuge
in
that
*NL*
power
,
of
the
extent
of
which
his
readers
were
no
judges
,
or
rather
*NL*
which
they
imagined
to
be
infinite
,
and
consequently
they
could
not
be
*NL*
shocked
at
any
prodigies
related
of
it
.
This
hath
been
strongly
urged
*NL*
in
defence
of
Homer
's
miracles
;
and
it
is
perhaps
a
defence
;
not
,
as
*NL*
Mr
Pope
would
have
it
,
because
Ulysses
told
a
set
of
foolish
lies
to
*NL*
the
Phaeacians
,
who
were
a
very
dull
nation
;
but
because
the
poet
*NL*
himself
wrote
to
heathens
,
to
whom
poetical
fables
were
articles
of
*NL*
faith
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
must
confess
,
so
compassionate
is
my
temper
,
*NL*
I
wish
Polypheme
had
confined
himself
to
his
milk
diet
,
and
preserved
*NL*
his
eye
;
nor
could
Ulysses
be
much
more
concerned
than
myself
,
when
*NL*
his
companions
were
turned
into
swine
by
Circe
,
who
showed
,
I
think
,
*NL*
afterwards
,
too
much
regard
for
man
's
flesh
to
be
supposed
capable
of
*NL*
converting
it
into
bacon
.
I
wish
,
likewise
,
with
all
my
heart
,
that
*NL*
Homer
could
have
known
the
rule
prescribed
by
Horace
,
to
introduce
*NL*
supernatural
agents
as
seldom
as
possible
.
We
should
not
then
have
*NL*
seen
his
gods
coming
on
trivial
errands
,
and
often
behaving
themselves
*NL*
so
as
not
only
to
forfeit
all
title
to
respect
,
but
to
become
the
*NL*
objects
of
scorn
and
derision
.
A
conduct
which
must
have
shocked
the
*NL*
credulity
of
a
pious
and
sagacious
heathen
;
and
which
could
never
have
*NL*
been
defended
,
unless
by
agreeing
with
a
supposition
to
which
I
have
*NL*
been
sometimes
almost
inclined
,
that
this
most
glorious
poet
,
as
he
*NL*
certainly
was
,
had
an
intent
to
burlesque
the
superstitious
faith
of
*NL*
his
own
age
and
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
have
rested
too
long
on
a
doctrine
which
can
be
of
no
use
to
a
*NL*
Christian
writer
;
for
as
he
can
not
introduce
into
his
works
any
of
*NL*
that
heavenly
host
which
make
a
part
of
his
creed
,
so
it
is
horrid
*NL*
puerility
to
search
the
heathen
theology
for
any
of
those
deities
who
*NL*
have
been
long
since
dethroned
from
their
immortality
.
Lord
*NL*
Shaftesbury
observes
,
that
nothing
is
more
cold
than
the
invocation
of
*NL*
a
muse
by
a
modern
;
he
might
have
added
,
that
nothing
can
be
more
*NL*
absurd
.
A
modern
may
with
much
more
elegance
invoke
a
ballad
,
as
some
*NL*
have
thought
Homer
did
,
or
a
mug
of
ale
,
with
the
author
of
Hudibras
;
*NL*
which
latter
may
perhaps
have
inspired
much
more
poetry
,
as
well
as
*NL*
prose
,
than
all
the
liquors
of
Hippocrene
or
Helicon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
supernatural
agents
which
can
in
any
manner
be
allowed
to
us
*NL*
moderns
,
are
ghosts
;
but
of
these
I
would
advise
an
author
to
be
*NL*
extremely
sparing
.
These
are
indeed
,
like
arsenic
,
and
other
dangerous
*NL*
drugs
in
physic
,
to
be
used
with
the
utmost
caution
;
nor
would
I
*NL*
advise
the
introduction
of
them
at
all
in
those
works
,
or
by
those
*NL*
authors
,
to
which
,
or
to
whom
,
a
horse-laugh
in
the
reader
would
be
*NL*
any
great
prejudice
or
mortification
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
elves
and
fairies
,
and
other
such
mummery
,
I
purposely
omit
the
*NL*
mention
of
them
,
as
I
should
be
very
unwilling
to
confine
within
any
*NL*
bounds
those
surprizing
imaginations
,
for
whose
vast
capacity
the
*NL*
limits
of
human
nature
are
too
narrow
;
whose
works
are
to
be
*NL*
considered
as
a
new
creation
;
and
who
have
consequently
just
right
to
*NL*
do
what
they
will
with
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Man
therefore
is
the
highest
subject
-LRB-
unless
on
very
extraordinary
*NL*
occasions
indeed
-RRB-
which
presents
itself
to
the
pen
of
our
historian
,
*NL*
or
of
our
poet
;
and
,
in
relating
his
actions
,
great
care
is
to
be
*NL*
taken
that
we
do
not
exceed
the
capacity
of
the
agent
we
describe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
is
possibility
alone
sufficient
to
justify
us
;
we
must
keep
*NL*
likewise
within
the
rules
of
probability
.
It
is
,
I
think
,
the
opinion
*NL*
of
Aristotle
;
or
if
not
,
it
is
the
opinion
of
some
wise
man
,
whose
*NL*
authority
will
be
as
weighty
when
it
is
as
old
,
``
That
it
is
no
excuse
*NL*
for
a
poet
who
relates
what
is
incredible
,
that
the
thing
related
is
*NL*
really
matter
of
fact
.
''
This
may
perhaps
be
allowed
true
with
regard
*NL*
to
poetry
,
but
it
may
be
thought
impracticable
to
extend
it
to
the
*NL*
historian
;
for
he
is
obliged
to
record
matters
as
he
finds
them
,
*NL*
though
they
may
be
of
so
extraordinary
a
nature
as
will
require
no
*NL*
small
degree
of
historical
faith
to
swallow
them
.
Such
was
the
*NL*
successless
armament
of
Xerxes
described
by
Herodotus
,
or
the
*NL*
successful
expedition
of
Alexander
related
by
Arrian
.
Such
of
later
*NL*
years
was
the
victory
of
Agincourt
obtained
by
Harry
the
Fifth
,
or
*NL*
that
of
Narva
won
by
Charles
the
Twelfth
of
Sweden
.
All
which
*NL*
instances
,
the
more
we
reflect
on
them
,
appear
still
the
more
*NL*
astonishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
facts
,
however
,
as
they
occur
in
the
thread
of
the
story
,
nay
,
*NL*
indeed
,
as
they
constitute
the
essential
parts
of
it
,
the
historian
is
*NL*
not
only
justifiable
in
recording
as
they
really
happened
,
but
indeed
*NL*
would
be
unpardonable
should
he
omit
or
alter
them
.
But
there
are
*NL*
other
facts
not
of
such
consequence
nor
so
necessary
,
which
,
though
*NL*
ever
so
well
attested
,
may
nevertheless
be
sacrificed
to
oblivion
in
*NL*
complacence
to
the
scepticism
of
a
reader
.
Such
is
that
memorable
*NL*
story
of
the
ghost
of
George
Villiers
,
which
might
with
more
propriety
*NL*
have
been
made
a
present
of
to
Dr
Drelincourt
,
to
have
kept
the
ghost
*NL*
of
Mrs
Veale
company
,
at
the
head
of
his
Discourse
upon
Death
,
than
*NL*
have
been
introduced
into
so
solemn
a
work
as
the
History
of
the
*NL*
Rebellion
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
if
the
historian
will
confine
himself
to
what
really
*NL*
happened
,
and
utterly
reject
any
circumstance
,
which
,
though
never
so
*NL*
well
attested
,
he
must
be
well
assured
is
false
,
he
will
sometimes
*NL*
fall
into
the
marvellous
,
but
never
into
the
incredible
.
He
will
often
*NL*
raise
the
wonder
and
surprize
of
his
reader
,
but
never
that
*NL*
incredulous
hatred
mentioned
by
Horace
.
It
is
by
falling
into
fiction
,
*NL*
therefore
,
that
we
generally
offend
against
this
rule
,
of
deserting
*NL*
probability
,
which
the
historian
seldom
,
if
ever
,
quits
,
till
he
*NL*
forsakes
his
character
and
commences
a
writer
of
romance
.
In
this
,
*NL*
however
,
those
historians
who
relate
public
transactions
,
have
the
*NL*
advantage
of
us
who
confine
ourselves
to
scenes
of
private
life
.
The
*NL*
credit
of
the
former
is
by
common
notoriety
supported
for
a
long
time
;
*NL*
and
public
records
,
with
the
concurrent
testimony
of
many
authors
,
*NL*
bear
evidence
to
their
truth
in
future
ages
.
Thus
a
Trajan
and
an
*NL*
Antoninus
,
a
Nero
and
a
Caligula
,
have
all
met
with
the
belief
of
*NL*
posterity
;
and
no
one
doubts
but
that
men
so
very
good
,
and
so
very
*NL*
bad
,
were
once
the
masters
of
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
who
deal
in
private
character
,
who
search
into
the
most
retired
*NL*
recesses
,
and
draw
forth
examples
of
virtue
and
vice
from
holes
and
*NL*
corners
of
the
world
,
are
in
a
more
dangerous
situation
.
As
we
have
no
*NL*
public
notoriety
,
no
concurrent
testimony
,
no
records
to
support
and
*NL*
corroborate
what
we
deliver
,
it
becomes
us
to
keep
within
the
limits
*NL*
not
only
of
possibility
,
but
of
probability
too
;
and
this
more
*NL*
especially
in
painting
what
is
greatly
good
and
amiable
.
Knavery
and
*NL*
folly
,
though
never
so
exorbitant
,
will
more
easily
meet
with
assent
;
*NL*
for
ill-nature
adds
great
support
and
strength
to
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
we
may
,
perhaps
,
with
little
danger
,
relate
the
history
of
*NL*
Fisher
;
who
having
long
owed
his
bread
to
the
generosity
of
Mr
Derby
,
*NL*
and
having
one
morning
received
a
considerable
bounty
from
his
hands
,
*NL*
yet
,
in
order
to
possess
himself
of
what
remained
in
his
friend
's
*NL*
scrutore
,
concealed
himself
in
a
public
office
of
the
Temple
,
through
*NL*
which
there
was
a
passage
into
Mr
Derby
's
chambers
.
Here
he
overheard
*NL*
Mr
Derby
for
many
hours
solacing
himself
at
an
entertainment
which
he
*NL*
that
evening
gave
his
friends
,
and
to
which
Fisher
had
been
invited
.
*NL*
During
all
this
time
,
no
tender
,
no
grateful
reflections
arose
to
*NL*
restrain
his
purpose
;
but
when
the
poor
gentleman
had
let
his
company
*NL*
out
through
the
office
,
Fisher
came
suddenly
from
his
lurking-place
,
*NL*
and
walking
softly
behind
his
friend
into
his
chamber
,
discharged
a
*NL*
pistol-ball
into
his
head
.
This
may
be
believed
when
the
bones
of
*NL*
Fisher
are
as
rotten
as
his
heart
.
Nay
,
perhaps
,
it
will
be
credited
,
*NL*
that
the
villain
went
two
days
afterwards
with
some
young
ladies
to
*NL*
the
play
of
Hamlet
;
and
with
an
unaltered
countenance
heard
one
of
the
*NL*
ladies
,
who
little
suspected
how
near
she
was
to
the
person
,
cry
out
,
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
if
the
man
that
murdered
Mr
Derby
was
now
present
!
''
*NL*
manifesting
in
this
a
more
seared
and
callous
conscience
than
even
*NL*
Nero
himself
;
of
whom
we
are
told
by
Suetonius
,
``
that
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
his
guilt
,
after
the
death
of
his
mother
,
became
*NL*
immediately
intolerable
,
and
so
continued
;
nor
could
all
the
*NL*
congratulations
of
the
soldiers
,
of
the
senate
,
and
the
people
,
allay
*NL*
the
horrors
of
his
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
on
the
other
hand
,
should
I
tell
my
reader
,
that
I
had
known
*NL*
a
man
whose
penetrating
genius
had
enabled
him
to
raise
a
large
*NL*
fortune
in
a
way
where
no
beginning
was
chaulked
out
to
him
;
that
he
*NL*
had
done
this
with
the
most
perfect
preservation
of
his
integrity
,
and
*NL*
not
only
without
the
least
injustice
or
injury
to
any
one
individual
*NL*
person
,
but
with
the
highest
advantage
to
trade
,
and
a
vast
increase
*NL*
of
the
public
revenue
;
that
he
had
expended
one
part
of
the
income
of
*NL*
this
fortune
in
discovering
a
taste
superior
to
most
,
by
works
where
*NL*
the
highest
dignity
was
united
with
the
purest
simplicity
,
and
another
*NL*
part
in
displaying
a
degree
of
goodness
superior
to
all
men
,
by
acts
*NL*
of
charity
to
objects
whose
only
recommendations
were
their
merits
,
or
*NL*
their
wants
;
that
he
was
most
industrious
in
searching
after
merit
in
*NL*
distress
,
most
eager
to
relieve
it
,
and
then
as
careful
-LRB-
perhaps
too
*NL*
careful
-RRB-
to
conceal
what
he
had
done
;
that
his
house
,
his
furniture
,
*NL*
his
gardens
,
his
table
,
his
private
hospitality
,
and
his
public
*NL*
beneficence
,
all
denoted
the
mind
from
which
they
flowed
,
and
were
all
*NL*
intrinsically
rich
and
noble
,
without
tinsel
,
or
external
ostentation
;
*NL*
that
he
filled
every
relation
in
life
with
the
most
adequate
virtue
;
*NL*
that
he
was
most
piously
religious
to
his
Creator
,
most
zealously
*NL*
loyal
to
his
sovereign
;
a
most
tender
husband
to
his
wife
,
a
kind
*NL*
relation
,
a
munificent
patron
,
a
warm
and
firm
friend
,
a
knowing
and
a
*NL*
chearful
companion
,
indulgent
to
his
servants
,
hospitable
to
his
*NL*
neighbours
,
charitable
to
the
poor
,
and
benevolent
to
all
mankind
.
*NL*
Should
I
add
to
these
the
epithets
of
wise
,
brave
,
elegant
,
and
indeed
*NL*
every
other
amiable
epithet
in
our
language
,
I
might
surely
say
,
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
Quis
credet
?
nemo
Hercule
!
nemo
;
*NL*
Vel
duo
,
vel
nemo
;
_
*NL*
*NL*
and
yet
I
know
a
man
who
is
all
I
have
here
described
.
But
a
single
*NL*
instance
-LRB-
and
I
really
know
not
such
another
-RRB-
is
not
sufficient
to
*NL*
justify
us
,
while
we
are
writing
to
thousands
who
never
heard
of
the
*NL*
person
,
nor
of
anything
like
him
.
Such
_
rarae
aves
_
should
be
remitted
*NL*
to
the
epitaph
writer
,
or
to
some
poet
who
may
condescend
to
hitch
him
*NL*
in
a
distich
,
or
to
slide
him
into
a
rhime
with
an
air
of
carelessness
*NL*
and
neglect
,
without
giving
any
offence
to
the
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
last
place
,
the
actions
should
be
such
as
may
not
only
be
*NL*
within
the
compass
of
human
agency
,
and
which
human
agents
may
*NL*
probably
be
supposed
to
do
;
but
they
should
be
likely
for
the
very
*NL*
actors
and
characters
themselves
to
have
performed
;
for
what
may
be
*NL*
only
wonderful
and
surprizing
in
one
man
,
may
become
improbable
,
or
*NL*
indeed
impossible
,
when
related
of
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
requisite
is
what
the
dramatic
critics
call
conversation
of
*NL*
character
;
and
it
requires
a
very
extraordinary
degree
of
judgment
,
*NL*
and
a
most
exact
knowledge
of
human
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
admirably
remarked
by
a
most
excellent
writer
,
that
zeal
can
no
*NL*
more
hurry
a
man
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
itself
,
than
a
rapid
*NL*
stream
can
carry
a
boat
against
its
own
current
.
I
will
venture
to
*NL*
say
,
that
for
a
man
to
act
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
dictates
of
*NL*
his
nature
,
is
,
if
not
impossible
,
as
improbable
and
as
miraculous
as
*NL*
anything
which
can
well
be
conceived
.
Should
the
best
parts
of
the
*NL*
story
of
M.
Antoninus
be
ascribed
to
Nero
,
or
should
the
worst
*NL*
incidents
of
Nero
's
life
be
imputed
to
Antoninus
,
what
would
be
more
*NL*
shocking
to
belief
than
either
instance
?
whereas
both
these
being
*NL*
related
of
their
proper
agent
,
constitute
the
truly
marvellous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
modern
authors
of
comedy
have
fallen
almost
universally
into
the
*NL*
error
here
hinted
at
;
their
heroes
generally
are
notorious
rogues
,
and
*NL*
their
heroines
abandoned
jades
,
during
the
first
four
acts
;
but
in
the
*NL*
fifth
,
the
former
become
very
worthy
gentlemen
,
and
the
latter
women
*NL*
of
virtue
and
discretion
:
nor
is
the
writer
often
so
kind
as
to
give
*NL*
himself
the
least
trouble
to
reconcile
or
account
for
this
monstrous
*NL*
change
and
incongruity
.
There
is
,
indeed
,
no
other
reason
to
be
*NL*
assigned
for
it
,
than
because
the
play
is
drawing
to
a
conclusion
;
as
*NL*
if
it
was
no
less
natural
in
a
rogue
to
repent
in
the
last
act
of
a
*NL*
play
,
than
in
the
last
of
his
life
;
which
we
perceive
to
be
generally
*NL*
the
case
at
Tyburn
,
a
place
which
might
indeed
close
the
scene
of
some
*NL*
comedies
with
much
propriety
,
as
the
heroes
in
these
are
most
commonly
*NL*
eminent
for
those
very
talents
which
not
only
bring
men
to
the
*NL*
gallows
,
but
enable
them
to
make
an
heroic
figure
when
they
are
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
these
few
restrictions
,
I
think
,
every
writer
may
be
permitted
*NL*
to
deal
as
much
in
the
wonderful
as
he
pleases
;
nay
,
if
he
thus
keeps
*NL*
within
the
rules
of
credibility
,
the
more
he
can
surprize
the
reader
*NL*
the
more
he
will
engage
his
attention
,
and
the
more
he
will
charm
him
.
*NL*
As
a
genius
of
the
highest
rank
observes
in
his
fifth
chapter
of
the
*NL*
Bathos
,
``
The
great
art
of
all
poetry
is
to
mix
truth
with
fiction
,
in
*NL*
order
to
join
the
credible
with
the
surprizing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
though
every
good
author
will
confine
himself
within
the
bounds
of
*NL*
probability
,
it
is
by
no
means
necessary
that
his
characters
,
or
his
*NL*
incidents
,
should
be
trite
,
common
,
or
vulgar
;
such
as
happen
in
every
*NL*
street
,
or
in
every
house
,
or
which
may
be
met
with
in
the
home
*NL*
articles
of
a
newspaper
.
Nor
must
he
be
inhibited
from
showing
many
*NL*
persons
and
things
,
which
may
possibly
have
never
fallen
within
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
great
part
of
his
readers
.
If
the
writer
strictly
*NL*
observes
the
rules
above-mentioned
,
he
hath
discharged
his
part
;
and
*NL*
is
then
intitled
to
some
faith
from
his
reader
,
who
is
indeed
guilty
*NL*
of
critical
infidelity
if
he
disbelieves
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
want
of
a
portion
of
such
faith
,
I
remember
the
character
of
a
*NL*
young
lady
of
quality
,
which
was
condemned
on
the
stage
for
being
*NL*
unnatural
,
by
the
unanimous
voice
of
a
very
large
assembly
of
clerks
*NL*
and
apprentices
;
though
it
had
the
previous
suffrages
of
many
ladies
*NL*
of
the
first
rank
;
one
of
whom
,
very
eminent
for
her
understanding
,
*NL*
declared
it
was
the
picture
of
half
the
young
people
of
her
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
ii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
the
landlady
pays
a
visit
to
Mr
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jones
had
taken
leave
of
his
friend
the
lieutenant
,
he
*NL*
endeavoured
to
close
his
eyes
,
but
all
in
vain
;
his
spirits
were
too
*NL*
lively
and
wakeful
to
be
lulled
to
sleep
.
So
having
amused
,
or
rather
*NL*
tormented
,
himself
with
the
thoughts
of
his
Sophia
till
it
was
open
*NL*
daylight
,
he
called
for
some
tea
;
upon
which
occasion
my
landlady
*NL*
herself
vouchsafed
to
pay
him
a
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
indeed
the
first
time
she
had
seen
him
,
or
at
least
had
taken
*NL*
any
notice
of
him
;
but
as
the
lieutenant
had
assured
her
that
he
was
*NL*
certainly
some
young
gentleman
of
fashion
,
she
now
determined
to
show
*NL*
him
all
the
respect
in
her
power
;
for
,
to
speak
truly
,
this
was
one
of
*NL*
those
houses
where
gentlemen
,
to
use
the
language
of
advertisements
,
*NL*
meet
with
civil
treatment
for
their
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
no
sooner
begun
to
make
his
tea
,
than
she
likewise
began
to
*NL*
discourse
:
--
``
La
!
sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
think
it
is
great
pity
that
such
a
*NL*
pretty
young
gentleman
should
under-value
himself
so
,
as
to
go
about
*NL*
with
these
soldier
fellows
.
They
call
themselves
gentlemen
,
I
warrant
*NL*
you
;
but
,
as
my
first
husband
used
to
say
,
they
should
remember
it
is
*NL*
we
that
pay
them
.
And
to
be
sure
it
is
very
hard
upon
us
to
be
obliged
*NL*
to
pay
them
,
and
to
keep
`
um
too
,
as
we
publicans
are
.
I
had
twenty
of
*NL*
`
um
last
night
,
besides
officers
:
nay
,
for
matter
o
'
that
,
I
had
*NL*
rather
have
the
soldiers
than
officers
:
for
nothing
is
ever
good
*NL*
enough
for
those
sparks
;
and
I
am
sure
,
if
you
was
to
see
the
bills
;
*NL*
la
!
sir
,
it
is
nothing
.
I
have
had
less
trouble
,
I
warrant
you
,
with
a
*NL*
good
squire
's
family
,
where
we
take
forty
or
fifty
shillings
of
a
*NL*
night
,
besides
horses
.
And
yet
I
warrants
me
,
there
is
narrow
a
one
of
*NL*
those
officer
fellows
but
looks
upon
himself
to
be
as
good
as
arrow
a
*NL*
squire
of
L500
a
year
.
To
be
sure
it
doth
me
good
to
hear
their
men
*NL*
run
about
after
`
um
,
crying
your
honour
,
and
your
honour
.
Marry
come
*NL*
up
with
such
honour
,
and
an
ordinary
at
a
shilling
a
head
.
Then
*NL*
there
's
such
swearing
among
`
um
,
to
be
sure
it
frightens
me
out
o
'
my
*NL*
wits
:
I
thinks
nothing
can
ever
prosper
with
such
wicked
people
.
And
*NL*
here
one
of
`
um
has
used
you
in
so
barbarous
a
manner
.
I
thought
*NL*
indeed
how
well
the
rest
would
secure
him
;
they
all
hang
together
;
for
*NL*
if
you
had
been
in
danger
of
death
,
which
I
am
glad
to
see
you
are
*NL*
not
,
it
would
have
been
all
as
one
to
such
wicked
people
.
They
would
*NL*
have
let
the
murderer
go
.
Laud
have
mercy
upon
`
um
;
I
would
not
have
*NL*
such
a
sin
to
answer
for
,
for
the
whole
world
.
But
though
you
are
*NL*
likely
,
with
the
blessing
,
to
recover
,
there
is
laa
for
him
yet
;
and
*NL*
if
you
will
employ
lawyer
Small
,
I
darest
be
sworn
he
'll
make
the
*NL*
fellow
fly
the
country
for
him
;
though
perhaps
he
'll
have
fled
the
*NL*
country
before
;
for
it
is
here
to-day
and
gone
to-morrow
with
such
*NL*
chaps
.
I
hope
,
however
,
you
will
learn
more
wit
for
the
future
,
and
*NL*
return
back
to
your
friends
;
I
warrant
they
are
all
miserable
for
your
*NL*
loss
;
and
if
they
was
but
to
know
what
had
happened
--
La
,
my
seeming
!
I
*NL*
would
not
for
the
world
they
should
.
Come
,
come
,
we
know
very
well
*NL*
what
all
the
matter
is
;
but
if
one
wo
n't
,
another
will
;
so
pretty
a
*NL*
gentleman
need
never
want
a
lady

I
am
sure
,
if
I
was
you

I
would
see
*NL*
the
finest
she
that
ever
wore
a

hanged

do
n't

in

I
confess

How

the

says
Jones
:

do

great
and
good
Mr

then

``
Yes

who
in

``
The
fame
of
*NL*
his
goodness
indeed
,

answered
Jones
,
``
must
have
extended
farther
than
*NL*
this
;
but
heaven
only
can
know
him
--
can
know
that
benevolence
which
it
*NL*
copied
from
itself
,
and
sent
upon
earth
as
its
own
pattern
.
Mankind
*NL*
are
as
ignorant
of
such
divine
goodness
,
as
they
are
unworthy
of
it
;
*NL*
but
none
so
unworthy
of
it
as
myself
.
I
,
who
was
raised
by
him
to
such
*NL*
a
height
;
taken
in
,
as
you
must
well
know
,
a
poor
base-born
child
,
*NL*
adopted
by
him
,
and
treated
as
his
own
son
,
to
dare
by
my
follies
to
*NL*
disoblige
him
,
to
draw
his
vengeance
upon
me
.
Yes
,
I
deserve
it
all
;
*NL*
for
I
will
never
be
so
ungrateful
as
ever
to
think
he
hath
done
an
act
*NL*
of
injustice
by
me

No

I
deserve
to
be
turned
out
of
doors

as
I
am

*NL*
And
now
,
madam
,

says
he
,
``
I
believe
you
will
not
blame
me
for
turning
*NL*
soldier

especially
with
such
a
fortune
as
this

pocket

''
At
*NL*
which
words
he
shook
a
purse
,
which
had
but
very
little
in
it
,
and
*NL*
which
still
appeared
to
the
landlady
to
have
less

*NL*
*NL*
My
good
landlady
was
-LRB-
according
to
vulgar
phrase
-RRB-
struck
all
of
a
heap
*NL*
by
this
relation
.
She
answered
coldly
,
``
That
to
be
sure
people
were
*NL*
the
best
judges
what
was
most
proper

But
*NL*
hark
,

says
she
,
``
I
think
I
hear
somebody
call

Coming

At
*NL*
which
words
,
without
taking
any
leave
,
she
flung
out
of
the
room
;
for
*NL*
the
lower
sort
of
people
are
very
tenacious
of
respect
;
and
though
*NL*
they
are
contented
to
give
this

to
persons
of
quality
,
yet
they
*NL*
never
confer
it

well
paid
for
their

Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
the
surgeon
makes
his
second
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
proceed
any
farther
,
that
the
reader
may
not
be
mistaken
in
*NL*
imagining
the
landlady
knew
more
than
she
did
,
nor
surprized
that
she
*NL*
knew
so
much
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
inform
him
that
the
lieutenant
*NL*
had
acquainted
her
that
the
name
of
Sophia
had
been
the
occasion
of
*NL*
the
quarrel
;
and
as
for
the
rest
of
her
knowledge
,
the
sagacious
*NL*
reader
will
observe
how
she
came
by
it
in
the
preceding
scene
.
Great
*NL*
curiosity
was
indeed
mixed
with
her
virtues
;
and
she
never
willingly
*NL*
suffered
any
one
to
depart
from
her
house
,
without
enquiring
as
much
*NL*
as
possible
into
their
names
,
families
,
and
fortunes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
no
sooner
gone
than
Jones
,
instead
of
animadverting
on
her
*NL*
behaviour
,
reflected
that
he
was
in
the
same
bed
which
he
was
informed
*NL*
had
held
his
dear
Sophia
.
This
occasioned
a
thousand
fond
and
tender
*NL*
thoughts
,
which
we
would
dwell
longer
upon
,
did
we
not
consider
that
*NL*
such
kind
of
lovers
will
make
a
very
inconsiderable
part
of
our
*NL*
readers
.
In
this
situation
the
surgeon
found
him
,
when
he
came
to
*NL*
dress
his
wound
.
The
doctor
perceiving
,
upon
examination
,
that
his
*NL*
pulse
was
disordered
,
and
hearing
that
he
had
not
slept
,
declared
that
*NL*
he
was
in
great
danger
;
for
he
apprehended
a
fever
was
coming
on
,
*NL*
which
he
would
have
prevented
by
bleeding
,
but
Jones
would
not
submit
,
*NL*
declaring
he
would
lose
no
more
blood
;
``
and
,
doctor
,
''
says
he
,
``
if
you
*NL*
will
be
so
kind
only
to
dress
my
head
,
I
have
no
doubt
of
being
well
*NL*
in
a
day
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
''
answered
the
surgeon
,
``
I
could
assure
your
being
well
in
a
*NL*
month
or
two
.
Well
,
indeed
!
No
,
no
,
people
are
not
so
soon
well
of
*NL*
such
contusions
;
but
,
sir
,
I
am
not
at
this
time
of
day
to
be
*NL*
instructed
in
my
operations
by
a
patient
,
and
I
insist
on
making
a
*NL*
revulsion
before
I
dress
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
persisted
obstinately
in
his
refusal
,
and
the
doctor
at
last
*NL*
yielded
;
telling
him
at
the
same
time
that
he
would
not
be
answerable
*NL*
for
the
ill
consequence
,
and
hoped
he
would
do
him
the
justice
to
*NL*
acknowledge
that
he
had
given
him
a
contrary
advice
;
which
the
patient
*NL*
promised
he
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
retired
into
the
kitchen
,
where
,
addressing
himself
to
the
*NL*
landlady
,
he
complained
bitterly
of
the
undutiful
behaviour
of
his
*NL*
patient
,
who
would
not
be
blooded
,
though
he
was
in
a
fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
an
eating
fever
then
,
''
says
the
landlady
;
``
for
he
hath
devoured
*NL*
two
swinging
buttered
toasts
this
morning
for
breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
''
says
the
doctor
:
``
I
have
known
people
eat
in
a
fever
;
*NL*
and
it
is
very
easily
accounted
for
;
because
the
acidity
occasioned
by
*NL*
the
febrile
matter
may
stimulate
the
nerves
of
the
diaphragm
,
and
*NL*
thereby
occasion
a
craving
which
will
not
be
easily
distinguishable
*NL*
from
a
natural
appetite
;
but
the
aliment
will
not
be
concreted
,
nor
*NL*
assimilated
into
chyle
,
and
so
will
corrode
the
vascular
orifices
,
and
*NL*
thus
will
aggravate
the
febrific
symptoms
.
Indeed
,
I
think
the
*NL*
gentleman
in
a
very
dangerous
way
,
and
,
if
he
is
not
blooded
,
I
am
*NL*
afraid
will
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
man
must
die
some
time
or
other
,
''
answered
the
good
woman
;
``
it
*NL*
is
no
business
of
mine
.
I
hope
,
doctor
,
you
would
not
have
me
hold
him
*NL*
while
you
bleed
him
.
But
,
hark
`
ee
,
a
word
in
your
ear
;
I
would
advise
*NL*
you
,
before
you
proceed
too
far
,
to
take
care
who
is
to
be
your
*NL*
paymaster
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Paymaster
!
''
said
the
doctor
,
staring
;
``
why
,
I
've
a
gentleman
under
my
*NL*
hands
,
have
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
imagined
so
as
well
as
you
,
''
said
the
landlady
;
``
but
,
as
my
first
*NL*
husband
used
to
say
,
everything
is
not
what
it
looks
to
be
.
He
is
an
*NL*
arrant
scrub
,
I
assure
you
.
However
,
take
no
notice
that
I
mentioned
*NL*
anything
to
you
of
the
matter
;
but
I
think
people
in
business
oft
*NL*
always
to
let
one
another
know
such
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
I
suffered
such
a
fellow
as
this
,
''
cries
the
doctor
,
in
a
*NL*
passion
,
``
to
instruct
me
?
Shall
I
hear
my
practice
insulted
by
one
who
*NL*
will
not
pay
me
?
I
am
glad
I
have
made
this
discovery
in
time
.
I
will
*NL*
see
now
whether
he
will
be
blooded
or
no
.
''
He
then
immediately
went
*NL*
upstairs
,
and
flinging
open
the
door
of
the
chamber
with
much
*NL*
violence
,
awaked
poor
Jones
from
a
very
sound
nap
,
into
which
he
was
*NL*
fallen
,
and
,
what
was
still
worse
,
from
a
delicious
dream
concerning
*NL*
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
be
blooded
or
no
?
''
cries
the
doctor
,
in
a
rage
.
``
I
have
told
*NL*
you
my
resolution
already
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
and
I
wish
with
all
my
*NL*
heart
you
had
taken
my
answer
;
for
you
have
awaked
me
out
of
the
*NL*
sweetest
sleep
which
I
ever
had
in
my
life

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay

''
cries
the
doctor
;
``
many
a
man
hath
dozed
away
his
life

*NL*
Sleep
is
not
always
good
,
no
more
than
food
;
but
remember
,
I
demand
of
*NL*
you
for
the
last
time

will
you
be
blooded

--
``
I
answer
you
for
the
*NL*
last
time

said
Jones
,
``
I
will
not

``
Then
I
wash
my
hands
of
you
,

*NL*
cries
the
doctor
;

I
desire
you
to
pay
me
for

trouble
I
have
*NL*
had
already

Two
journeys
at

Jones
,
``
you
do
n't
intend
*NL*
to
leave
me
in
this
condition
.
''
--
``
Indeed
but
I
shall
,
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
you
have
used
me
rascally
,
and
I
will
not
pay
you
*NL*
a
farthing
.
''
--
``
Very
well
,
''
cries
the
doctor
;
``
the
first
loss
is
the
*NL*
best
.
What
a
pox
did
my
landlady
mean
by
sending
for
me
to
such
*NL*
vagabonds
!
''
At
which
words
he
flung
out
of
the
room
,
and
his
patient
*NL*
turning
himself
about
soon
recovered
his
sleep
;
but
his
dream
was
*NL*
unfortunately
gone
.

Chapter
iv

*NL*
*NL*
In
which
is
introduced
one
of
the
pleasantest
barbers
that
was
ever
*NL*
recorded
in
history
,
the
barber
of
Bagdad
,
or
he
in
Don
Quixote
,
not
*NL*
excepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
had
now
struck
five
when
Jones
awaked
from
a
nap
of
seven
*NL*
hours
,
so
much
refreshed
,
and
in
such
perfect
health
and
spirits
,
that
*NL*
he
resolved
to
get
up
and
dress
himself
;
for
which
purpose
he
unlocked
*NL*
his
portmanteau
,
and
took
out
clean
linen
,
and
a
suit
of
cloaths
;
but
*NL*
first
he
slipt
on
a
frock
,
and
went
down
into
the
kitchen
to
bespeak
*NL*
something
that
might
pacify
certain
tumults
he
found
rising
within
his
*NL*
stomach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meeting
the
landlady
,
he
accosted
her
with
great
civility
,
and
asked
,
*NL*
``
What
he
could
have
for
dinner
?
''
--
``
For
dinner
!
''
says
she
;
``
it
is
an
*NL*
odd
time
a
day
to
think
about
dinner
.
There
is
nothing
drest
in
the
*NL*
house
,
and
the
fire
is
almost
out
.
''
--
``
Well
,
but
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
must
*NL*
have
something
to
eat
,
and
it
is
almost
indifferent
to
me
what
;
for
,
*NL*
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
was
never
more
hungry
in
my
life
.
''
--
``
Then
,
''
*NL*
says
she
,
``
I
believe
there
is
a
piece
of
cold
buttock
and
carrot
,
*NL*
which
will
fit
you
.
''
--
``
Nothing
better
,
''
answered
Jones
;
``
but
I
should
*NL*
be
obliged
to
you
,
if
you
would
let
it
be
fried
.
''
To
which
the
*NL*
landlady
consented
,
and
said
,
smiling
,
``
she
was
glad
to
see
him
so
*NL*
well
recovered
;
''
for
the
sweetness
of
our
heroe
's
temper
was
almost
*NL*
irresistible
;
besides
,
she
was
really
no
ill-humoured
woman
at
the
*NL*
bottom
;
but
she
loved
money
so
much
,
that
she
hated
everything
which
*NL*
had
the
semblance
of
poverty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
now
returned
in
order
to
dress
himself
,
while
his
dinner
was
*NL*
preparing
,
and
was
,
according
to
his
orders
,
attended
by
the
barber
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
barber
,
who
went
by
the
name
of
Little
Benjamin
,
was
a
fellow
of
*NL*
great
oddity
and
humour
,
which
had
frequently
let
him
into
small
*NL*
inconveniencies
,
such
as
slaps
in
the
face
,
kicks
in
the
breech
,
*NL*
broken
bones
,
&
c.
For
every
one
doth
not
understand
a
jest
;
and
those
*NL*
who
do
are
often
displeased
with
being
themselves
the
subjects
of
it
.
*NL*
This
vice
was
,
however
,
incurable
in
him
;
and
though
he
had
often
*NL*
smarted
for
it
,
yet
if
ever
he
conceived
a
joke
,
he
was
certain
to
be
*NL*
delivered
of
it
,
without
the
least
respect
of
persons
,
time
,
or
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
great
many
other
particularities
in
his
character
,
which
I
*NL*
shall
not
mention
,
as
the
reader
will
himself
very
easily
perceive
*NL*
them
,
on
his
farther
acquaintance
with
this
extraordinary
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
being
impatient
to
be
drest
,
for
a
reason
which
may
be
easily
*NL*
imagined
,
thought
the
shaver
was
very
tedious
in
preparing
his
suds
,
*NL*
and
begged
him
to
make
haste
;
to
which
the
other
answered
with
much
*NL*
gravity
,
for
he
never
discomposed
his
muscles
on
any
account
,
*NL*
''
_
Festina
lente
_
,
is
a
proverb
which
I
learned
long
before
I
ever
*NL*
touched
a
razor
.
''
--
``
I
find
,
friend
,
you
are
a
scholar
,
''
replied
Jones
.
*NL*
``
A
poor
one
,
''
said
the
barber
,
''
_
non
omnia
possumus
omnes
.
_
''
--
``
Again
!
''
*NL*
said
Jones
;
``
I
fancy
you
are
good
at
capping
verses
.
''
--
``
Excuse
me
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
said
the
barber
,
''
_
non
tanto
me
dignor
honore
_
.
''
And
then
*NL*
proceeding
to
his
operation
,
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
since
I
have
dealt
in
*NL*
suds
,
I
could
never
discover
more
than
two
reasons
for
shaving
;
the
*NL*
one
is
to
get
a
beard
,
and
the
other
to
get
rid
of
one
.
I
conjecture
,
*NL*
sir
,
it
may
not
be
long
since
you
shaved
from
the
former
of
these
*NL*
motives
.
Upon
my
word
,
you
have
had
good
success
;
for
one
may
say
of
*NL*
your
beard
,
that
it
is
_
tondenti
gravior
_
.
''
--
``
I
conjecture
,
''
says
*NL*
Jones
,
``
that
thou
art
a
very
comical
fellow
.
''
--
``
You
mistake
me
widely
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
said
the
barber
:
``
I
am
too
much
addicted
to
the
study
of
*NL*
philosophy
;
_
hinc
illae
lacrymae
_
,
sir
;
that
's
my
misfortune
.
Too
much
*NL*
learning
hath
been
my
ruin
.
''
--
``
Indeed
,
''
says
Jones
,
``
I
confess
,
*NL*
friend
,
you
have
more
learning
than
generally
belongs
to
your
trade
;
*NL*
but
I
ca
n't
see
how
it
can
have
injured
you
.
''
--
``
Alas
!
sir
,
''
answered
*NL*
the
shaver
,
``
my
father
disinherited
me
for
it
.
He
was
a
*NL*
dancing-master
;
and
because
I
could
read
before
I
could
dance
,
he
took
*NL*
an
aversion
to
me
,
and
left
every
farthing
among
his
other
*NL*
children
.
--
Will
you
please
to
have
your
temples
--
O
la
!
I
ask
your
*NL*
pardon
,
I
fancy
there
is
_
hiatus
in
manuscriptis
_
.
I
heard
you
was
*NL*
going
to
the
wars
;
but
I
find
it
was
a
mistake
.
''
--
``
Why
do
you
conclude
*NL*
so
?
''
says
Jones
.
``
Sure
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
barber
,
``
you
are
too
wise
a
*NL*
man
to
carry
a
broken
head
thither
;
for
that
would
be
carrying
coals
*NL*
to
Newcastle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
thou
art
a
very
odd
fellow
,
and
I
like
*NL*
thy
humour
extremely
;
I
shall
be
very
glad
if
thou
wilt
come
to
me
*NL*
after
dinner
,
and
drink
a
glass
with
me
;
I
long
to
be
better
*NL*
acquainted
with
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
dear
sir
!
''
said
the
barber
,
``
I
can
do
you
twenty
times
as
great
a
*NL*
favour
,
if
you
will
accept
of
it
.
''
--
``
What
is
that
,
my
friend
?
''
cries
*NL*
Jones
.
``
Why
,
I
will
drink
a
bottle
with
you
if
you
please
;
for
I
*NL*
dearly
love
good-nature
;
and
as
you
have
found
me
out
to
be
a
comical
*NL*
fellow
,
so
I
have
no
skill
in
physiognomy
,
if
you
are
not
one
of
the
*NL*
best-natured
gentlemen
in
the
universe
.
''
Jones
now
walked
downstairs
*NL*
neatly
drest
,
and
perhaps
the
fair
Adonis
was
not
a
lovelier
figure
;
*NL*
and
yet
he
had
no
charms
for
my
landlady
;
for
as
that
good
woman
did
*NL*
not
resemble
Venus
at
all
in
her
person
,
so
neither
did
she
in
her
*NL*
taste
.
Happy
had
it
been
for
Nanny
the
chambermaid
,
if
she
had
seen
*NL*
with
the
eyes
of
her
mistress
,
for
that
poor
girl
fell
so
violently
in
*NL*
love
with
Jones
in
five
minutes
,
that
her
passion
afterwards
cost
her
*NL*
many
a
sigh
.
This
Nanny
was
extremely
pretty
,
and
altogether
as
coy
;
*NL*
for
she
had
refused
a
drawer
,
and
one
or
two
young
farmers
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
but
the
bright
eyes
of
our
heroe
thawed
all
her
ice
in
*NL*
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jones
returned
to
the
kitchen
,
his
cloth
was
not
yet
laid
;
nor
*NL*
indeed
was
there
any
occasion
it
should
,
his
dinner
remaining
_
in
*NL*
statu
quo
_
,
as
did
the
fire
which
was
to
dress
it
.
This
disappointment
*NL*
might
have
put
many
a
philosophical
temper
into
a
passion
;
but
it
had
*NL*
no
such
effect
on
Jones
.
He
only
gave
the
landlady
a
gentle
rebuke
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
Since
it
was
so
difficult
to
get
it
heated
he
would
eat
the
*NL*
beef
cold
.
''
But
now
the
good
woman
,
whether
moved
by
compassion
,
or
by
*NL*
shame
,
or
by
whatever
other
motive
,
I
can
not
tell
,
first
gave
her
*NL*
servants
a
round
scold
for
disobeying
the
orders
which
she
had
never
*NL*
given
,
and
then
bidding
the
drawer
lay
a
napkin
in
the
Sun
,
she
set
*NL*
about
the
matter
in
good
earnest
,
and
soon
accomplished
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Sun
,
into
which
Jones
was
now
conducted
,
was
truly
named
,
as
*NL*
_
lucus
a
non
lucendo
_
;
for
it
was
an
apartment
into
which
the
sun
had
*NL*
scarce
ever
looked
.
It
was
indeed
the
worst
room
in
the
house
;
and
*NL*
happy
was
it
for
Jones
that
it
was
so
.
However
,
he
was
now
too
hungry
*NL*
to
find
any
fault
;
but
having
once
satisfied
his
appetite
,
he
ordered
*NL*
the
drawer
to
carry
a
bottle
of
wine
into
a
better
room
,
and
expressed
*NL*
some
resentment
at
having
been
shown
into
a
dungeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drawer
having
obeyed
his
commands
,
he
was
,
after
some
time
,
*NL*
attended
by
the
barber
,
who
would
not
indeed
have
suffered
him
to
wait
*NL*
so
long
for
his
company
had
he
not
been
listening
in
the
kitchen
to
*NL*
the
landlady
,
who
was
entertaining
a
circle
that
she
had
gathered
*NL*
round
her
with
the
history
of
poor
Jones
,
part
of
which
she
had
*NL*
extracted
from
his
own
lips
,
and
the
other
part
was
her
own
ingenious
*NL*
composition
;
for
she
said
``
he
was
a
poor
parish
boy
,
taken
into
the
*NL*
house
of
Squire
Allworthy
,
where
he
was
bred
up
as
an
apprentice
,
and
*NL*
now
turned
out
of
doors
for
his
misdeeds
,
particularly
for
making
love
*NL*
to
his
young
mistress
,
and
probably
for
robbing
the
house
;
for
how
*NL*
else
should
he
come
by
the
little
money
he
hath
;
and
this
,
''
says
she
,
*NL*
``
is
your
gentleman
,
forsooth
!
''
--
``
A
servant
of
Squire
Allworthy
!
''
says
*NL*
the
barber
;
``
what
's
his
name
?
''
--
``
Why
he
told
me
his
name
was
Jones
,
''
*NL*
says
she
:
``
perhaps
he
goes
by
a
wrong
name
.
Nay
,
and
he
told
me
,
too
,
*NL*
that
the
squire
had
maintained
him
as
his
own
son
,
thof
he
had
*NL*
quarrelled
with
him
now
.
''
--
``
And
if
his
name
be
Jones
,
he
told
you
the
*NL*
truth
,
''
said
the
barber
;
``
for
I
have
relations
who
live
in
that
*NL*
country
;
nay
,
and
some
people
say
he
is
his
son
.
''
--
``
Why
doth
he
not
go
*NL*
by
the
name
of
his
father
?
''
--
``
I
ca
n't
tell
that
,
''
said
the
barber
;
*NL*
``
many
people
's
sons
do
n't
go
by
the
name
of
their
father
.
''
--
``
Nay
,
''
*NL*
said
the
landlady
,
``
if
I
thought
he
was
a
gentleman
's
son
,
thof
he
was
*NL*
a
bye-blow
,
I
should
behave
to
him
in
another
guess
manner
;
for
many
*NL*
of
these
bye-blows
come
to
be
great
men
,
and
,
as
my
poor
first
husband
*NL*
used
to
say
,
never
affront
any
customer
that
's
a
gentleman

A
dialogue
between
Mr
Jones
and
the
barber
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
passed
partly
while
Jones
was
at
dinner
in
his
*NL*
dungeon
,
and
partly
while
he
was
expecting
the
barber
in
the
parlour
.
*NL*
And
,
as
soon
as
it
was
ended
,
Mr
Benjamin
,
as
we
have
said
,
attended
*NL*
him
,
and
was
very
kindly
desired
to
sit
down
.
Jones
then
filling
out
a
*NL*
glass
of
wine
,
drank
his
health
by
the
appellation
of
_
doctissime
*NL*
tonsorum
_
.
''
_
Ago
tibi
gratias
,
domine
_
''
said
the
barber
;
and
then
*NL*
looking
very
steadfastly
at
Jones
,
he
said
,
with
great
gravity
,
and
*NL*
with
a
seeming
surprize
,
as
if
he
had
recollected
a
face
he
had
seen
*NL*
before
,
``
Sir
,
may
I
crave
the
favour
to
know
if
your
name
is
not
*NL*
Jones
?
''
To
which
the
other
answered
,
``
That
it
was
.
''
--
''
_
Proh
deum
atque
*NL*
hominum
fidem
_
!
''
says
the
barber
;
``
how
strangely
things
come
to
pass
!
*NL*
Mr
Jones
,
I
am
your
most
obedient
servant
.
I
find
you
do
not
know
me
,
*NL*
which
indeed
is
no
wonder
,
since
you
never
saw
me
but
once
,
and
then
*NL*
you
was
very
young

Pray
,
sir

how
doth
the
good
Squire
Allworthy
?
how
*NL*
doth

``
I
find

said
Jones
,
``
you
do
*NL*
indeed
know
me

but
I
have
not
the
like
happiness
of
recollecting

you

``
I
do
not
wonder
at
that

cries
Benjamin
;
``
but
I
am
surprized

I
did
not

sooner

not

And
*NL*
pray
,
sir

may
I
,
without
offence
,
enquire
whither
you
are
travelling
*NL*
this
way
?

``
Fill

Mr

said
Jones
,
``
and
ask
no
more
*NL*
questions

''
--
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
answered
Benjamin
,
``
I
would
not
be
*NL*
troublesome
;
and
I
hope
you
do
n't
think
me
a
man
of
an
impertinent
*NL*
curiosity
,
for
that
is
a
vice
which
nobody
can
lay
to
my
charge
;
but
I
*NL*
ask
pardon
;
for
when
a
gentleman
of
your
figure
travels
without
his
*NL*
servants
,
we
may
suppose
him
to
be
,
as
we
say
,
_
in

incognito

,
*NL*

perhaps
I
ought
not
to
have
mentioned
your
name

``
I
own

''
says
*NL*
Jones
,
``
I
did
not
expect
to
have
been
so
well
known
in
this
country
as
*NL*
I
find
I
am

yet
,
for
particular
reasons
,
I
shall
be
obliged
to
you

you
will
not

I
am
gone

_
Pauca

''
answered
the
barber
;
''
and
I
wish
no
other
*NL*
here
knew
you
but
myself
;
for
some
people
have
tongues
;
but
I
promise
*NL*
you
I
can
keep
a
secret

My
enemies
will
allow
me
that
virtue

--
``
And
*NL*
yet
that
is
not
the
characteristic
of
your
profession
,
Mr
Barber
,
''
*NL*
answered
Jones
.
``
Alas
!
sir
,
''
replied
Benjamin
,
''
_
Non
si
male

*NL*
olim

.
I
was
not
born
nor
bred
a
barber
,
I
assure
you
.
I
have
*NL*
spent
most
of
my
time
among
gentlemen
,
and
though
I
say
it
,
I
*NL*
understand
something
of
gentility
.
And
if
you
had
thought
me
as
worthy
*NL*
of
your
confidence
as
you
have
some
other
people
,
I
should
have
shown
*NL*
you
I
could
have
kept
a
secret
better
.
I
should
not
have
degraded
your
*NL*
name
in
a
public
kitchen
;
for
indeed
,
sir
,
some
people
have
not
used
*NL*
you
well
;
for
besides
making
a
public
proclamation
of
what
you
told
*NL*
them
of
a
quarrel
between
yourself
and
Squire
Allworthy
,
they
added
*NL*
lies
of
their
own
,
things
which
I
knew
to
be
lies
.
''
--
``
You
surprize
me
*NL*
greatly
,
''
cries
Jones
.
``
Upon
my
word
,
sir
,
''
answered
Benjamin
,
``
I
tell
*NL*
the
truth
,
and
I
need
not
tell
you
my
landlady
was
the
person
.
I
am
*NL*
sure
it
moved
me
to
hear
the
story
,
and
I
hope
it
is
all
false
;
for
I
*NL*
have
a
great
respect
for
you
,
I
do
assure
you
I
have
,
and
have
had
*NL*
ever
since
the
good-nature
you
showed
to
Black
George
,
which
was
*NL*
talked
of
all
over
the
country
,
and
I
received
more
than
one
letter
*NL*
about
it
.
Indeed
,
it
made
you
beloved
by
everybody
.
You
will
pardon
*NL*
me
,
therefore
;
for
it
was
real
concern
at
what
I
heard
made
me
ask
*NL*
many
questions
;
for
I
have
no
impertinent
curiosity
about
me
:
but
I
*NL*
love
good-nature
and
thence
became
_
amoris
abundantia
erga
te
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
profession
of
friendship
easily
gains
credit
with
the
miserable
;
*NL*
it
is
no
wonder
therefore
,
if
Jones
,
who
,
besides
his
being
miserable
,
*NL*
was
extremely
open-hearted
,
very
readily
believed
all
the
professions
*NL*
of
Benjamin
,
and
received
him
into
his
bosom
.
The
scraps
of
Latin
,
*NL*
some
of
which
Benjamin
applied
properly
enough
,
though
it
did
not
*NL*
savour
of
profound
literature
,
seemed
yet
to
indicate
something
*NL*
superior
to
a
common
barber
;
and
so
indeed
did
his
whole
behaviour
.
*NL*
Jones
therefore
believed
the
truth
of
what
he
had
said
,
as
to
his
*NL*
original
and
education
;
and
at
length
,
after
much
entreaty
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Since
you
have
heard
,
my
friend
,
so
much
of
my
affairs
,
and
seem
so
*NL*
desirous
to
know
the
truth
,
if
you
will
have
patience
to
hear
it
,
I
*NL*
will
inform
you
of
the
whole
.
''
--
``
Patience
!
''
cries
Benjamin
,
``
that
I
*NL*
will
,
if
the
chapter
was
never
so
long
;
and
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
*NL*
you
for
the
honour
you
do
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
now
began
,
and
related
the
whole
history
,
forgetting
only
a
*NL*
circumstance
or
two
,
namely
,
everything
which
passed
on
that
day
in
*NL*
which
he
had
fought
with
Thwackum
;
and
ended
with
his
resolution
to
go
*NL*
to
sea
,
till
the
rebellion
in
the
North
had
made
him
change
his
*NL*
purpose
,
and
had
brought
him
to
the
place
where
he
then
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Benjamin
,
who
had
been
all
attention
,
never
once
interrupted
*NL*
the
narrative
;
but
when
it
was
ended
he
could
not
help
observing
,
that
*NL*
there
must
be
surely
something
more
invented
by
his
enemies
,
and
told
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
against
him
,
or
so
good
a
man
would
never
have
dismissed
*NL*
one
he
had
loved
so
tenderly
,
in
such
a
manner
.
To
which
Jones
*NL*
answered
,
``
He
doubted
not
but
such
villanous
arts
had
been
made
use
of
*NL*
to
destroy
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
surely
it
was
scarce
possible
for
any
one
to
have
avoided
making
*NL*
the
same
remark
with
the
barber
,
who
had
not
indeed
heard
from
Jones
*NL*
one
single
circumstance
upon
which
he
was
condemned
;
for
his
actions
*NL*
were
not
now
placed
in
those
injurious
lights
in
which
they
had
been
*NL*
misrepresented
to
Allworthy
;
nor
could
he
mention
those
many
false
*NL*
accusations
which
had
been
from
time
to
time
preferred
against
him
to
*NL*
Allworthy
:
for
with
none
of
these
he
was
himself
acquainted
.
He
had
*NL*
likewise
,
as
we
have
observed
,
omitted
many
material
facts
in
his
*NL*
present
relation
.
Upon
the
whole
,
indeed
,
everything
now
appeared
in
*NL*
such
favourable
colours
to
Jones
,
that
malice
itself
would
have
found
*NL*
it
no
easy
matter
to
fix
any
blame
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
Jones
desired
to
conceal
or
to
disguise
the
truth
;
nay
,
he
*NL*
would
have
been
more
unwilling
to
have
suffered
any
censure
to
fall
on
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
for
punishing
him
,
than
on
his
own
actions
for
deserving
*NL*
it
;
but
,
in
reality
,
so
it
happened
,
and
so
it
always
will
happen
;
for
*NL*
let
a
man
be
never
so
honest
,
the
account
of
his
own
conduct
will
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
himself
,
be
so
very
favourable
,
that
his
vices
will
come
*NL*
purified
through
his
lips
,
and
,
like
foul
liquors
well
strained
,
will
*NL*
leave
all
their
foulness
behind
.
For
though
the
facts
themselves
may
*NL*
appear
,
yet
so
different
will
be
the
motives
,
circumstances
,
and
*NL*
consequences
,
when
a
man
tells
his
own
story
,
and
when
his
enemy
tells
*NL*
it
,
that
we
scarce
can
recognise
the
facts
to
be
one
and
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
barber
had
drank
down
this
story
with
greedy
ears
,
he
was
*NL*
not
yet
satisfied
.
There
was
a
circumstance
behind
which
his
*NL*
curiosity
,
cold
as
it
was
,
most
eagerly
longed
for
.
Jones
had
*NL*
mentioned
the
fact
of
his
amour
,
and
of
his
being
the
rival
of
Blifil
,
*NL*
but
had
cautiously
concealed
the
name
of
the
young
lady
.
The
barber
,
*NL*
therefore
,
after
some
hesitation
,
and
many
hums
and
hahs
,
at
last
*NL*
begged
leave
to
crave
the
name
of
the
lady
,
who
appeared
to
be
the
*NL*
principal
cause
of
all
this
mischief
.
Jones
paused
a
moment
,
and
then
*NL*
said
,
``
Since
I
have
trusted
you
with
so
much
,
and
since
,
I
am
afraid
,
*NL*
her
name
is
become
too
publick
already
on
this
occasion
,
I
will
not
*NL*
conceal
it
from
you
.
Her
name
is
Sophia
Western
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Proh
deum
atque
hominum
fidem
_
!
Squire
Western
hath
a
daughter
grown
*NL*
a
woman
!
''
--
``
Ay
,
and
such
a
woman
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
that
the
world
can
not
*NL*
match
.
No
eye
ever
saw
anything
so
beautiful
;
but
that
is
her
least
*NL*
excellence
.
Such
sense
!
such
goodness
!
Oh
,
I
could
praise
her
for
*NL*
ever
,
and
yet
should
omit
half
her
virtues
!
''
--
``
Mr
Western
a
daughter
*NL*
grown
up
!

cries
the
barber
:
``
I
remember
the
father
a
boy
;
well
,
*NL*
_
Tempus

_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wine
being
now
at
an
end
,
the
barber
pressed
very
eagerly
to
be
*NL*
his
bottle
;
but
Jones
absolutely
refused
,
saying
,
``
He
had
already
*NL*
drank
more
than
he
ought
:
and
that
he
now
chose
to
retire
to
his
room
,
*NL*
where
he
wished
he
could
procure
himself
a
book
.
''
--
``
A
book
!
''
cries
*NL*
Benjamin
;
``
what
book
would
you
have
?
Latin
or
English
?
I
have
some
*NL*
curious
books
in
both
languages
;
such
as
_
Erasmi
Colloquia
,
Ovid
de
*NL*
Tristibus
,
Gradus
ad
Parnassum
;
_
and
in
English
I
have
several
of
the
*NL*
best
books
,
though
some
of
them
are
a
little
torn
;
but
I
have
a
great
*NL*
part
of
Stowe
's
Chronicle
;
the
sixth
volume
of
Pope
's
Homer
;
the
third
*NL*
volume
of
the
Spectator
;
the
second
volume
of
Echard
's
Roman
History
;
*NL*
the
Craftsman
;
Robinson

;
Thomas
a

and
two
volumes
of

Tom
Brown
's
Works

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
last

cries
Jones
,
``
are
books
I
never
saw
,
so
if
you
please
*NL*
lend
me
one
of
those
volumes

''
The
barber
assured
him
he
would
be
*NL*
highly
entertained
,
for
he
looked
upon
the
author
to
have
been
one
of
*NL*
the
greatest
wits
that
ever
the
nation
produced
.
He
then
stepped
to
*NL*
his
house
,
which
was
hard
by
,
and
immediately
returned
;
after
which
,
*NL*
the
barber
having
received
very
strict
injunctions
of
secrecy
from
*NL*
Jones
,
and
having
sworn
inviolably
to
maintain
it
,
they
separated
;
the
*NL*
barber
went
home
,
and
Jones
retired
to
his
chamber
.

In
which
more
of
the
talents
of
Mr
Benjamin
will
appear
,
as
well
as
*NL*
who
this
extraordinary
person
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
Jones
grew
a
little
uneasy
at
the
desertion
of
his
*NL*
surgeon
,
as
he
apprehended
some
inconvenience
,
or
even
danger
,
might
*NL*
attend
the
not
dressing
his
wound
;
he
enquired
of
the
drawer
,
what
*NL*
other
surgeons
were
to
be
met
with
in
that
neighbourhood
.
The
drawer
*NL*
told
him
,
there
was
one
not
far
off
;
but
he
had
known
him
often
refuse
*NL*
to
be
concerned
after
another
had
been
sent
before
him
;
``
but
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
says
he
,
``
if
you
will
take
my
advice
,
there
is
not
a
man
in
the
*NL*
kingdom
can
do
your
business
better
than
the
barber
who
was
with
you
*NL*
last
night
.
We
look
upon
him
to
be
one
of
the
ablest
men
at
a
cut
in
*NL*
all
this
neighbourhood
.
For
though
he
hath
not
been
her
above
three
*NL*
months
,
he
hath
done
several
great
cures
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
drawer
was
presently
dispatched
for
Little
Benjamin
,
who
being
*NL*
acquainted
in
what
capacity
he
was
wanted
,
prepared
himself
*NL*
accordingly
,
and
attended
;
but
with
so
different
an
air
and
aspect
*NL*
from
that
which
he
wore
when
his
basin
was
under
his
arm
,
that
he
*NL*
could
scarce
be
known
to
be
the
same
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
tonsor
,
''
says
Jones
,
``
I
find
you
have
more
trades
than
one
;
how
*NL*
came
you
not
to
inform
me
of
this
last
night
?
''
--
``
A
surgeon
,
''
answered
*NL*
Benjamin
,
with
great
gravity
,
``
is
a
profession
,
not
a
trade
.
The
*NL*
reason
why
I
did
not
acquaint
you
last
night
that
I
professed
this
*NL*
art
,
was
,
that
I
then
concluded
you
was
under
the
hands
of
another
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
I
never
love
to
interfere
with
my
brethren
in
their
*NL*
business
.
_
Ars
omnibus
communis
_
.
But
now
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
I
will
*NL*
inspect
your
head
,
and
when
I
see
into
your
skull
,
I
will
give
my
*NL*
opinion
of
your
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
no
great
faith
in
this
new
professor
;
however
,
he
suffered
*NL*
him
to
open
the
bandage
and
to
look
at
his
wound
;
which
as
soon
as
he
*NL*
had
done
,
Benjamin
began
to
groan
and
shake
his
head
violently
.
Upon
*NL*
which
Jones
,
in
a
peevish
manner
,
bid
him
not
play
the
fool
,
but
tell
*NL*
him
in
what
condition
he
found
him
.
``
Shall
I
answer
you
as
a
surgeon
,
*NL*
or
a
friend
?
''
said
Benjamin
.
``
As
a
friend
,
and
seriously
,
''
said
Jones
.
*NL*
``
Why
then
,
upon
my
soul
,
''
cries
Benjamin
,
``
it
would
require
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
art
to
keep
you
from
being
well
after
a
very
few
dressings
;
*NL*
and
if
you
will
suffer
me
to
apply
some
salve
of
mine
,
I
will
answer
*NL*
for
the
success
.
''
Jones
gave
his
consent
,
and
the
plaister
was
applied
*NL*
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
sir
,
''
cries
Benjamin
:
``
now
I
will
,
if
you
please
,
resume
my
*NL*
former
self

but
a
man
is
obliged

keep
up
some
dignity
in
his
*NL*
countenance
whilst
he
is
performing
these
operations
,
or
the
world
*NL*
will
not
submit
to
be
handled
by
him

grave

make
you
laugh

a
surgeon
ought
rather
to
make
you
cry

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Barber

or
Mr
Surgeon

or
Mr
Barber-surgeon

said
Jones
.
``
O
dear
*NL*
sir
!
''
answered
Benjamin
,
interrupting
him
,
''

Infandum

You
recall
to
my
mind
that
cruel
separation
of
the
*NL*
united
fraternities
,
so
much
to
the
prejudice
of
both
bodies
,
as
all
*NL*
separations
must
be
,
according
to
the
old
adage
,
_
Vis
unita
fortior
_
;
*NL*
which
to
be
sure
there
are
not
wanting
some
of
one
or
of
the
other
*NL*
fraternity
who
are
able
to
construe
.
What
a
blow
was
this
to
me
,
who
*NL*
unite
both
in
my
own
person
!
''
``
Well
,
by
whatever
name
you
please
to
be
*NL*
called
,
''
continued
Jones
,
``
you
certainly
are
one
of
the
oddest
,
most
*NL*
comical
fellows
I
ever
met
with
,
and
must
have
something
very
*NL*
surprizing
in
your
story
,
which
you
must
confess
I
have
a
right
to
*NL*
hear
.
''
--
``
I
do
confess
it
,
''
answered
Benjamin
,
``
and
will
very
readily
*NL*
acquaint
you
with
it
,
when
you
have
sufficient
leisure
,
for
I
promise
*NL*
you
it
will
require
a
good
deal
of
time
.
''
Jones
told
him
,
he
could
*NL*
never
be
more
at
leisure
than
at
present
.
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Benjamin
,
*NL*
``
I
will
obey
you
;
but
first
I
will
fasten
the
door
,
that
none
may
*NL*
interrupt
us
.
''
He
did
so
,
and
then
advancing
with
a
solemn
air
to
*NL*
Jones
,
said
:
``
I
must
begin
by
telling
you
,
sir
,
that
you
yourself
have
*NL*
been
the
greatest
enemy
I
ever
had
.
''
Jones
was
a
little
startled
at
*NL*
this
sudden
declaration
.
``
I
your
enemy
,
sir
!
''
says
he
,
with
much
*NL*
amazement
,
and
some
sternness
in
his
look
.
``
Nay
,
be
not
angry
,
''
said
*NL*
Benjamin
,
``
for
I
promise
you
I
am
not
.
You
are
perfectly
innocent
of
*NL*
having
intended
me
any
wrong
;
for
you
was
then
an
infant
:
but
I
shall
,
*NL*
I
believe
,
unriddle
all
this
the
moment
I
mention
my
name
.
Did
you
*NL*
never
hear
,
sir
,
of
one
Partridge
,
who
had
the
honour
of
being
reputed
*NL*
your
father
,
and
the
misfortune
of
being
ruined
by
that
honour
?
''
``
I
*NL*
have
,
indeed
,
heard
of
that
Partridge
,
''
says
Jones
,
``
and
have
always
*NL*
believed
myself
to
be
his
son
.
''
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
answered
Benjamin
,
``
I
am
*NL*
that
Partridge
;
but
I
here
absolve
you
from
all
filial
duty
,
for
I
do
*NL*
assure
you
,
you
are
no
son
of
mine
.
''
``
How
!
''
replied
Jones
,
``
and
is
it
*NL*
possible
that
a
false
suspicion
should
have
drawn
all
the
ill
*NL*
consequences
upon
you
,
with
which
I
am
too
well
acquainted
?
''
``
It
is
*NL*
possible
,
''
cries
Benjamin
,
``
for
it
is
so
:
but
though
it
is
natural
*NL*
enough
for
men
to
hate
even
the
innocent
causes
of
their
sufferings
,
*NL*
yet
I
am
of
a
different
temper
.
I
have
loved
you
ever
since
I
heard
of
*NL*
your
behaviour
to
Black
George
,
as
I
told
you
;
and
I
am
convinced
,
*NL*
from
this
extraordinary
meeting
,
that
you
are
born
to
make
me
amends
*NL*
for
all
I
have
suffered
on
that
account
.
Besides
,
I
dreamt
,
the
night
*NL*
before
I
saw
you
,
that
I
stumbled
over
a
stool
without
hurting
myself
;
*NL*
which
plainly
showed
me
something
good
was
towards
me
:
and
last
night
*NL*
I
dreamt
again
,
that
I
rode
behind
you
on
a
milk-white
mare
,
which
is
*NL*
a
very
excellent
dream
,
and
betokens
much
good
fortune
,
which
I
am
*NL*
resolved
to
pursue
unless
you
have
the
cruelty
to
deny
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
very
glad
,
Mr
Partridge
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
to
have
it
in
*NL*
my
power
to
make
you
amends
for
your
sufferings
on
my
account
,
though
*NL*
at
present
I
see
no
likelihood
of
it
;
however
,
I
assure
you
I
will
*NL*
deny
you
nothing
which
is
in
my
power
to
grant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
in
your
power
sure
enough
,
''
replied
Benjamin
;
``
for
I
desire
*NL*
nothing
more
than
leave
to
attend
you
in
this
expedition
.
Nay
,
I
have
*NL*
so
entirely
set
my
heart
upon
it
,
that
if
you
should
refuse
me
,
you
*NL*
will
kill
both
a
barber
and
a
surgeon
in
one
breath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
answered
,
smiling
,
that
he
should
be
very
sorry
to
be
the
*NL*
occasion
of
so
much
mischief
to
the
public
.
He
then
advanced
many
*NL*
prudential
reasons
,
in
order
to
dissuade
Benjamin
-LRB-
whom
we
shall
*NL*
hereafter
call
Partridge
-RRB-
from
his
purpose
;
but
all
were
in
vain
.
*NL*
Partridge
relied
strongly
on
his
dream
of
the
milk-white
mare
.
*NL*
``
Besides
,
sir
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
promise
you
I
have
as
good
an
inclination
*NL*
to
the
cause
as
any
man
can
possibly
have
;
and
go
I
will
,
whether
you
*NL*
admit
me
to
go
in
your
company
or
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
who
was
as
much
pleased
with
Partridge
as
Partridge
could
be
*NL*
with
him
,
and
who
had
not
consulted
his
own
inclination
but
the
good
*NL*
of
the
other
in
desiring
him
to
stay
behind
,
when
he
found
his
friend
*NL*
so
resolute
,
at
last
gave
his
consent
;
but
then
recollecting
himself
,
*NL*
he
said
,
``
Perhaps
,
Mr
Partridge
,
you
think
I
shall
be
able
to
support
*NL*
you
,
but
I
really
am
not
;
''
and
then
taking
out
his
purse
,
he
told
out
*NL*
nine
guineas
,
which
he
declared
were
his
whole
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
answered
,
``
That
his
dependence
was
only
on
his
future
*NL*
favour
;
for
he
was
thoroughly
convinced
he
would
shortly
have
enough
*NL*
in
his
power
.
At
present
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
believe
I
am
rather
the
*NL*
richer
man
of
the
two
;
but
all
I
have
is
at
your
service
,
and
at
your
*NL*
disposal
.
I
insist
upon
your
taking
the
whole
,
and
I
beg
only
to
*NL*
attend
you
in
the
quality
of
your
servant
;
_
Nil
desperandum
est
Teucro
*NL*
duce
et
auspice
Teucro
_
''
:
but
to
this
generous
proposal
concerning
the
*NL*
money
,
Jones
would
by
no
means
submit
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
resolved
to
set
out
the
next
morning
,
when
a
difficulty
arose
*NL*
concerning
the
baggage
;
for
the
portmanteau
of
Mr
Jones
was
too
large
*NL*
to
be
carried
without
a
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
may
presume
to
give
my
advice
,
''
says
Partridge
,
``
this
*NL*
portmanteau
,
with
everything
in
it
,
except
a
few
shirts
,
should
be
*NL*
left
behind
.
Those
I
shall
be
easily
able
to
carry
for
you
,
and
the
*NL*
rest
of
your
cloaths
will
remain
very
safe
locked
up
in
my
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
method
was
no
sooner
proposed
than
agreed
to
;
and
then
the
barber
*NL*
departed
,
in
order
to
prepare
everything
for
his
intended
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
better
reasons
than
any
which
have
yet
appeared
for
the
*NL*
conduct
of
Partridge
;
an
apology
for
the
weakness
of
Jones
;
and
some
*NL*
further
anecdotes
concerning
my
landlady
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Partridge
was
one
of
the
most
superstitious
of
men
,
he
would
*NL*
hardly
perhaps
have
desired
to
accompany
Jones
on
his
expedition
*NL*
merely
from
the
omens
of
the
joint-stool
and
white
mare
,
if
his
*NL*
prospect
had
been
no
better
than
to
have
shared
the
plunder
gained
in
*NL*
the
field
of
battle
.
In
fact
,
when
Partridge
came
to
ruminate
on
the
*NL*
relation
he
had
heard
from
Jones
,
he
could
not
reconcile
to
himself
*NL*
that
Mr
Allworthy
should
turn
his
son
-LRB-
for
so
he
most
firmly
believed
*NL*
him
to
be
-RRB-
out
of
doors
,
for
any
reason
which
he
had
heard
assigned
.
*NL*
He
concluded
,
therefore
,
that
the
whole
was
a
fiction
,
and
that
Jones
,
*NL*
of
whom
he
had
often
from
his
correspondents
heard
the
wildest
*NL*
character
,
had
in
reality
run
away
from
his
father
.
It
came
into
his
*NL*
head
,
therefore
,
that
if
he
could
prevail
with
the
young
gentleman
to
*NL*
return
back
to
his
father
,
he
should
by
that
means
render
a
service
to
*NL*
Allworthy
,
which
would
obliterate
all
his
former
anger
;
nay
,
indeed
,
*NL*
he
conceived
that
very
anger
was
counterfeited
,
and
that
Allworthy
had
*NL*
sacrificed
him
to
his
own
reputation
.
And
this
suspicion
indeed
he
*NL*
well
accounted
for
,
from
the
tender
behaviour
of
that
excellent
man
to
*NL*
the
foundling
child
;
from
his
great
severity
to
Partridge
,
who
,
*NL*
knowing
himself
to
be
innocent
,
could
not
conceive
that
any
other
*NL*
should
think
him
guilty
;
lastly
,
from
the
allowance
which
he
had
*NL*
privately
received
long
after
the
annuity
had
been
publickly
taken
*NL*
from
him
,
and
which
he
looked
upon
as
a
kind
of
smart-money
,
or
rather
*NL*
by
way
of
atonement
for
injustice
;
for
it
is
very
uncommon
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
for
men
to
ascribe
the
benefactions
they
receive
to
pure
charity
,
when
*NL*
they
can
possibly
impute
them
to
any
other
motive
.
If
he
could
by
any
*NL*
means
therefore
persuade
the
young
gentleman
to
return
home
,
he
*NL*
doubted
not
but
that
he
should
again
be
received
into
the
favour
of
*NL*
Allworthy
,
and
well
rewarded
for
his
pains
;
nay
,
and
should
be
again
*NL*
restored
to
his
native
country
;
a
restoration
which
Ulysses
himself
*NL*
never
wished
more
heartily
than
poor
Partridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Jones
,
he
was
well
satisfied
with
the
truth
of
what
the
other
*NL*
had
asserted
,
and
believed
that
Partridge
had
no
other
inducements
but
*NL*
love
to
him
,
and
zeal
for
the
cause
;
a
blameable
want
of
caution
and
*NL*
diffidence
in
the
veracity
of
others
,
in
which
he
was
highly
worthy
of
*NL*
censure
.
To
say
the
truth
,
there
are
but
two
ways
by
which
men
become
*NL*
possessed
of
this
excellent
quality
.
The
one
is
from
long
experience
,
*NL*
and
the
other
is
from
nature
;
which
last
,
I
presume
,
is
often
meant
by
*NL*
genius
,
or
great
natural
parts
;
and
it
is
infinitely
the
better
of
the
*NL*
two
,
not
only
as
we
are
masters
of
it
much
earlier
in
life
,
but
as
it
*NL*
is
much
more
infallible
and
conclusive
;
for
a
man
who
hath
been
*NL*
imposed
on
by
ever
so
many
,
may
still
hope
to
find
others
more
honest
;
*NL*
whereas
he
who
receives
certain
necessary
admonitions
from
within
,
*NL*
that
this
is
impossible
,
must
have
very
little
understanding
indeed
,
*NL*
if
he
ever
renders
himself
liable
to
be
once
deceived
.
As
Jones
had
*NL*
not
this
gift
from
nature
,
he
was
too
young
to
have
gained
it
by
*NL*
experience
;
for
at
the
diffident
wisdom
which
is
to
be
acquired
this
*NL*
way
,
we
seldom
arrive
till
very
late
in
life
;
which
is
perhaps
the
*NL*
reason
why
some
old
men
are
apt
to
despise
the
understandings
of
all
*NL*
those
who
are
a
little
younger
than
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
spent
most
part
of
the
day
in
the
company
of
a
new
acquaintance
.
*NL*
This
was
no
other
than
the
landlord
of
the
house
,
or
rather
the
*NL*
husband
of
the
landlady
.
He
had
but
lately
made
his
descent
*NL*
downstairs
,
after
a
long
fit
of
the
gout
,
in
which
distemper
he
was
*NL*
generally
confined
to
his
room
during
one
half
of
the
year
;
and
during
*NL*
the
rest
,
he
walked
about
the
house
,
smoaked
his
pipe
,
and
drank
his
*NL*
bottle
with
his
friends
,
without
concerning
himself
in
the
least
with
*NL*
any
kind
of
business
.
He
had
been
bred
,
as
they
call
it
,
a
gentleman
;
*NL*
that
is
,
bred
up
to
do
nothing
;
and
had
spent
a
very
small
fortune
,
*NL*
which
he
inherited
from
an
industrious
farmer
his
uncle
,
in
hunting
,
*NL*
horse-racing
,
and
cock-fighting
,
and
had
been
married
by
my
landlady
*NL*
for
certain
purposes
,
which
he
had
long
since
desisted
from
answering
;
*NL*
for
which
she
hated
him
heartily
.
But
as
he
was
a
surly
kind
of
*NL*
fellow
,
so
she
contented
herself
with
frequently
upbraiding
him
by
*NL*
disadvantageous
comparisons
with
her
first
husband
,
whose
praise
she
*NL*
had
eternally
in
her
mouth
;
and
as
she
was
for
the
most
part
mistress
*NL*
of
the
profit
,
so
she
was
satisfied
to
take
upon
herself
the
care
and
*NL*
government
of
the
family
,
and
,
after
a
long
successless
struggle
,
to
*NL*
suffer
her
husband
to
be
master
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
when
Jones
retired
to
his
room
,
a
small
dispute
arose
*NL*
between
this
fond
couple
concerning
him
:
--
``
What
,
''
says
the
wife
,
``
you
*NL*
have
been
tippling
with
the
gentleman
,
I
see
?
''
--
``
Yes
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
husband
,
``
we
have
cracked
a
bottle
together
,
and
a
very
gentlemanlike
*NL*
man
he
is
,
and
hath
a
very
pretty
notion
of
horse-flesh
.
Indeed
,
he
is
*NL*
young
,
and
hath
not
seen
much
of
the
world
;
for
I
believe
he
hath
been
*NL*
at
very
few
horse-races
.
''
--
``
Oho
!
he
is
one
of
your
order
,
is
he
?
''
*NL*
replies
the
landlady
:
``
he
must
be
a
gentleman
to
be
sure
,
if
he
is
a
*NL*
horse-racer
.
The
devil
fetch
such
gentry
!
I
am
sure
I
wish
I
had
never
*NL*
seen
any
of
them
.
I
have
reason

horse-racers
truly

''

``
That
*NL*
you
have
,
''
says
the
husband
;
``
for
I
was
one
,
you
know
.
''
--
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
answered
she
,
``
you
are
a
pure
one
indeed
.
As
my
first
husband
used
to
*NL*
say
,
I
may
put
all
the
good
I
have
ever
got
by
you
in
my
eyes
,
and
see
*NL*
never
the
worse
.
''
--
``
D
--
n
your
first
husband
!
''
cries
he
.
``
Do
n't
d
--
n
a
*NL*
better
man
than
yourself
,
''
answered
the
wife
:
``
if
he
had
been
alive
,
*NL*
you
durst
not
have
done
it
.
''
--
``
Then
you
think
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
have
not
*NL*
so
much
courage
as
yourself
;
for
you
have
d
--
n
'd
him
often
in
my
*NL*
hearing
.
''
--
``
If
I
did
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
have
repented
of
it
many
's
the
*NL*
good
time
and
oft
.
And
if
he
was
so
good
to
forgive
me
a
word
spoken
*NL*
in
haste
or
so
,
it
doth
not
become
such
a
one
as
you
to
twitter
me
.
He
*NL*
was
a
husband
to
me
,
he
was
;
and
if
ever
I
did
make
use
of
an
ill
word
*NL*
or
so
in
a
passion
,
I
never
called
him
rascal
;
I
should
have
told
a
*NL*
lie
,
if
I
had
called
him
rascal
.
''
Much
more
she
said
,
but
not
in
his
*NL*
hearing
;
for
having
lighted
his
pipe
,
he
staggered
off
as
fast
as
he
*NL*
could
.
We
shall
therefore
transcribe
no
more
of
her
speech
,
as
it
*NL*
approached
still
nearer
and
nearer
to
a
subject
too
indelicate
to
find
*NL*
any
place
in
this
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
Partridge
appeared
at
the
bedside
of
Jones
,
ready
*NL*
equipped
for
the
journey
,
with
his
knapsack
at
his
back
.
This
was
his
*NL*
own
workmanship
;
for
besides
his
other
trades
,
he
was
no
indifferent
*NL*
taylor
.
He
had
already
put
up
his
whole
stock
of
linen
in
it
,
*NL*
consisting
of
four
shirts
,
to
which
he
now
added
eight
for
Mr
Jones
;
*NL*
and
then
packing
up
the
portmanteau
,
he
was
departing
with
it
towards
*NL*
his
own
house
,
but
was
stopt
in
his
way
by
the
landlady
,
who
refused
*NL*
to
suffer
any
removals
till
after
the
payment
of
the
reckoning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
absolute
governess
in
these
*NL*
regions
;
it
was
therefore
necessary
to
comply
with
her
rules
;
so
the
*NL*
bill
was
presently
writ
out
,
which
amounted
to
a
much
larger
sum
than
*NL*
might
have
been
expected
,
from
the
entertainment
which
Jones
had
met
*NL*
with
.
But
here
we
are
obliged
to
disclose
some
maxims
,
which
publicans
*NL*
hold
to
be
the
grand
mysteries
of
their
trade
.
The
first
is
,
If
they
*NL*
have
anything
good
in
their
house
-LRB-
which
indeed
very
seldom
happens
-RRB-
*NL*
to
produce
it
only
to
persons
who
travel
with
great
equipages
.
2dly
,
*NL*
To
charge
the
same
for
the
very
worst
provisions
,
as
if
they
were
the
*NL*
best
.
And
lastly
,
If
any
of
their
guests
call
but
for
little
,
to
make
*NL*
them
pay
a
double
price
for
everything
they
have
;
so
that
the
amount
*NL*
by
the
head
may
be
much
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bill
being
made
and
discharged
,
Jones
set
forward
with
Partridge
,
*NL*
carrying
his
knapsack
;
nor
did
the
landlady
condescend
to
wish
him
a
*NL*
good
journey
;
for
this
was
,
it
seems
,
an
inn
frequented
by
people
of
*NL*
fashion
;
and
I
know
not
whence
it
is
,
but
all
those
who
get
their
*NL*
livelihood
by
people
of
fashion
,
contract
as
much
insolence
to
the
*NL*
rest
of
mankind
,
as
if
they
really
belonged
to
that
rank
themselves
.

Chapter
viii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
arrives
at
Gloucester
,
and
goes
to
the
Bell
;
the
character
of
*NL*
that
house
,
and
of
a
petty-fogger
which
he
there
meets
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
and
Partridge
,
or
Little
Benjamin
-LRB-
which
epithet
of
Little
*NL*
was
perhaps
given
him
ironically
,
he
being
in
reality
near
six
feet
*NL*
high
-RRB-
,
having
left
their
last
quarters
in
the
manner
before
described
,
*NL*
travelled
on
to
Gloucester
without
meeting
any
adventure
worth
*NL*
relating
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
arrived
here
,
they
chose
for
their
house
of
entertainment
the
*NL*
sign
of
the
Bell
,
an
excellent
house
indeed
,
and
which
I
do
most
*NL*
seriously
recommend
to
every
reader
who
shall
visit
this
antient
city
.
*NL*
The
master
of
it
is
brother
to
the
great
preacher
Whitefield
;
but
is
*NL*
absolutely
untainted
with
the
pernicious
principles
of
Methodism
,
or
*NL*
of
any
other
heretical
sect
.
He
is
indeed
a
very
honest
plain
man
,
*NL*
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
not
likely
to
create
any
disturbance
either
in
*NL*
church
or
state
.
His
wife
hath
,
I
believe
,
had
much
pretension
to
*NL*
beauty
,
and
is
still
a
very
fine
woman
.
Her
person
and
deportment
*NL*
might
have
made
a
shining
figure
in
the
politest
assemblies
;
but
*NL*
though
she
must
be
conscious
of
this
and
many
other
perfections
,
she
*NL*
seems
perfectly
contented
with
,
and
resigned
to
,
that
state
of
life
to
*NL*
which
she
is
called
;
and
this
resignation
is
entirely
owing
to
the
*NL*
prudence
and
wisdom
of
her
temper
;
for
she
is
at
present
as
free
from
*NL*
any
Methodistical
notions
as
her
husband
:
I
say
at
present
;
for
she
*NL*
freely
confesses
that
her
brother
's
documents
made
at
first
some
*NL*
impression
upon
her
,
and
that
she
had
put
herself
to
the
expense
of
a
*NL*
long
hood
,
in
order
to
attend
the
extraordinary
emotions
of
the
*NL*
Spirit
;
but
having
found
,
during
an
experiment
of
three
weeks
,
no
*NL*
emotions
,
she
says
,
worth
a
farthing
,
she
very
wisely
laid
by
her
*NL*
hood
,
and
abandoned
the
sect
.
To
be
concise
,
she
is
a
very
friendly
*NL*
good-natured
woman
;
and
so
industrious
to
oblige
,
that
the
guests
must
*NL*
be
of
a
very
morose
disposition
who
are
not
extremely
well
satisfied
*NL*
in
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Whitefield
happened
to
be
in
the
yard
when
Jones
and
his
attendant
*NL*
marched
in
.
Her
sagacity
soon
discovered
in
the
air
of
our
heroe
*NL*
something
which
distinguished
him
from
the
vulgar
.
She
ordered
her
*NL*
servants
,
therefore
,
immediately
to
show
him
into
a
room
,
and
*NL*
presently
afterwards
invited
him
to
dinner
with
herself
;
which
*NL*
invitation
he
very
thankfully
accepted
;
for
indeed
much
less
agreeable
*NL*
company
than
that
of
Mrs
Whitefield
,
and
a
much
worse
entertainment
*NL*
than
she
had
provided
,
would
have
been
welcome
after
so
long
fasting
*NL*
and
so
long
a
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
Mr
Jones
and
the
good
governess
of
the
mansion
,
there
sat
down
*NL*
at
table
an
attorney
of
Salisbury
,
indeed
the
very
same
who
had
*NL*
brought
the
news
of
Mrs
Blifil
's
death
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
whose
*NL*
name
,
which
I
think
we
did
not
before
mention
,
was
Dowling
:
there
was
*NL*
likewise
present
another
person
,
who
stiled
himself
a
lawyer
,
and
who
*NL*
lived
somewhere
near
Linlinch
,
in
Somersetshire
.
This
fellow
,
I
say
,
*NL*
stiled
himself
a
lawyer
,
but
was
indeed
a
most
vile
petty-fogger
,
*NL*
without
sense
or
knowledge
of
any
kind
;
one
of
those
who
may
be
termed
*NL*
train-bearers
to
the
law
;
a
sort
of
supernumeraries
in
the
profession
,
*NL*
who
are
the
hackneys
of
attorneys
,
and
will
ride
more
miles
for
*NL*
half-a-crown
than
a
postboy
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
time
of
dinner
,
the
Somersetshire
lawyer
recollected
the
*NL*
face
of
Jones
,
which
he
had
seen
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
;
for
he
had
often
*NL*
visited
in
that
gentleman
's
kitchen
.
He
therefore
took
occasion
to
*NL*
enquire
after
the
good
family
there
with
that
familiarity
which
would
*NL*
have
become
an
intimate
friend
or
acquaintance
of
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
*NL*
indeed
he
did
all
in
his
power
to
insinuate
himself
to
be
such
,
though
*NL*
he
had
never
had
the
honour
of
speaking
to
any
person
in
that
family
*NL*
higher
than
the
butler
.
Jones
answered
all
his
questions
with
much
*NL*
civility
,
though
he
never
remembered
to
have
seen
the
petty-fogger
*NL*
before
;
and
though
he
concluded
,
from
the
outward
appearance
and
*NL*
behaviour
of
the
man
,
that
he
usurped
a
freedom
with
his
betters
,
to
*NL*
which
he
was
by
no
means
intitled
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
conversation
of
fellows
of
this
kind
is
of
all
others
the
most
*NL*
detestable
to
men
of
any
sense
,
the
cloth
was
no
sooner
removed
than
*NL*
Mr
Jones
withdrew
,
and
a
little
barbarously
left
poor
Mrs
Whitefield
*NL*
to
do
a
penance
,
which
I
have
often
heard
Mr
Timothy
Harris
,
and
other
*NL*
publicans
of
good
taste
,
lament
,
as
the
severest
lot
annexed
to
their
*NL*
calling
,
namely
,
that
of
being
obliged
to
keep
company
with
their
*NL*
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
no
sooner
quitted
the
room
,
than
the
petty-fogger
,
in
a
*NL*
whispering
tone
,
asked
Mrs
Whitefield
,
``
If
she
knew
who
that
fine
*NL*
spark
was
?
''
She
answered
,
``
She
had
never
seen
the
gentleman
*NL*
before
.
''
--
``
The
gentleman
,
indeed
!
''
replied
the
petty-fogger
;
``
a
pretty
*NL*
gentleman
,
truly
!
Why
,
he
's
the
bastard
of
a
fellow
who
was
hanged
for
*NL*
horse-stealing
.
He
was
dropt
at
Squire
Allworthy
's
door
,
where
one
of
*NL*
the
servants
found
him
in
a
box
so
full
of
rain-water
,
that
he
would
*NL*
certainly
have
been
drowned
,
had
he
not
been
reserved
for
another
*NL*
fate
.
''
--
``
Ay
,
ay
,
you
need
not
mention
it
,
I
protest
:
we
understand
*NL*
what
that
fate
is
very
well
,
''
cries
Dowling
,
with
a
most
facetious
*NL*
grin
.
--
``
Well
,
''
continued
the
other
,
``
the
squire
ordered
him
to
be
*NL*
taken
in
;
for
he
is
a
timbersome
man
everybody
knows
,
and
was
afraid
*NL*
of
drawing
himself
into
a
scrape
;
and
there
the
bastard
was
bred
up
,
*NL*
and
fed
,
and
cloathified
all
to
the
world
like
any
gentleman
;
and
*NL*
there
he
got
one
of
the
servant-maids
with
child
,
and
persuaded
her
to
*NL*
swear
it
to
the
squire
himself
;
and
afterwards
he
broke
the
arm
of
one
*NL*
Mr
Thwackum
a
clergyman
,
only
because
he
reprimanded
him
for
following
*NL*
whores
;
and
afterwards
he
snapt
a
pistol
at
Mr
Blifil
behind
his
back
;
*NL*
and
once
,
when
Squire
Allworthy
was
sick
,
he
got
a
drum
,
and
beat
it
*NL*
all
over
the
house
to
prevent
him
from
sleeping
;
and
twenty
other
*NL*
pranks
he
hath
played
,
for
all
which
,
about
four
or
five
days
ago
,
*NL*
just
before
I
left
the
country
,
the
squire
stripped
him
stark
naked
,
*NL*
and
turned
him
out
of
doors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
very
justly
too
,
I
protest
,
''
cries
Dowling
;
``
I
would
turn
my
own
*NL*
son
out
of
doors
,
if
he
was
guilty
of
half
as
much
.
And
pray
what
is
*NL*
the
name
of
this
pretty
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
name
o
'
un
?
''
answered
Petty-fogger
;
``
why
,
he
is
called
Thomas
*NL*
Jones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jones
!
''
answered
Dowling
a
little
eagerly
;
``
what
,
Mr
Jones
that
lived
*NL*
at
Mr
Allworthy
's
?
was
that
the
gentleman
that
dined
with
us
?
''
--
``
The
*NL*
very
same
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
I
have
heard
of
the
gentleman
,
''
cries
*NL*
Dowling
,
``
often
;
but
I
never
heard
any
ill
character
of
him
.
''
--
``
And
I
*NL*
am
sure
,
''
says
Mrs
Whitefield
,
``
if
half
what
this
gentleman
hath
said
*NL*
be
true
,
Mr
Jones
hath
the
most
deceitful
countenance
I
ever
saw
;
for
*NL*
sure
his
looks
promise
something
very
different
;
and
I
must
say
,
for
*NL*
the
little
I
have
seen
of
him
,
he
is
as
civil
a
well-bred
man
as
you
*NL*
would
wish
to
converse
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Petty-fogger
calling
to
mind
that
he
had
not
been
sworn
,
as
he
usually
*NL*
was
,
before
he
gave
his
evidence
,
now
bound
what
he
had
declared
with
*NL*
so
many
oaths
and
imprecations
that
the
landlady
's
ears
were
shocked
,
*NL*
and
she
put
a
stop
to
his
swearing
,
by
assuring
him
of
her
belief
.
*NL*
Upon
which
he
said
,
``
I
hope
,
madam
,
you
imagine
I
would
scorn
to
tell
*NL*
such
things
of
any
man
,
unless
I
knew
them
to
be
true
.
What
interest
*NL*
have
I
in
taking
away
the
reputation
of
a
man
who
never
injured
me
?
I
*NL*
promise
you
every
syllable
of
what
I
have
said
is
fact
,
and
the
whole
*NL*
country
knows
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mrs
Whitefield
had
no
reason
to
suspect
that
the
petty-fogger
had
*NL*
any
motive
or
temptation
to
abuse
Jones
,
the
reader
can
not
blame
her
*NL*
for
believing
what
he
so
confidently
affirmed
with
many
oaths
.
She
*NL*
accordingly
gave
up
her
skill
in
physiognomy
,
and
hence-forwards
*NL*
conceived
so
ill
an
opinion
of
her
guest
,
that
she
heartily
wished
him
*NL*
out
of
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dislike
was
now
farther
increased
by
a
report
which
Mr
Whitefield
*NL*
made
from
the
kitchen
,
where
Partridge
had
informed
the
company
,
``
That
*NL*
though
he
carried
the
knapsack
,
and
contented
himself
with
staying
*NL*
among
servants
,
while
Tom
Jones
-LRB-
as
he
called
him
-RRB-
was
regaling
in
the
*NL*
parlour
,
he
was
not
his
servant
,
but
only
a
friend
and
companion
,
and
*NL*
as
good
a
gentleman
as
Mr
Jones
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dowling
sat
all
this
while
silent
,
biting
his
fingers
,
making
faces
,
*NL*
grinning
,
and
looking
wonderfully
arch
;
at
last
he
opened
his
lips
,
*NL*
and
protested
that
the
gentleman
looked
like
another
sort
of
man
.
He
*NL*
then
called
for
his
bill
with
the
utmost
haste
,
declared
he
must
be
at
*NL*
Hereford
that
evening
,
lamented
his
great
hurry
of
business
,
and
*NL*
wished
he
could
divide
himself
into
twenty
pieces
,
in
order
to
be
at
*NL*
once
in
twenty
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
petty-fogger
now
likewise
departed
,
and
then
Jones
desired
the
*NL*
favour
of
Mrs
Whitefield
's
company
to
drink
tea
with
him
;
but
she
*NL*
refused
,
and
with
a
manner
so
different
from
that
with
which
she
had
*NL*
received
him
at
dinner
,
that
it
a
little
surprized
him
.
And
now
he
*NL*
soon
perceived
her
behaviour
totally
changed
;
for
instead
of
that
*NL*
natural
affability
which
we
have
before
celebrated
,
she
wore
a
*NL*
constrained
severity
on
her
countenance
,
which
was
so
disagreeable
to
*NL*
Mr
Jones
,
that
he
resolved
,
however
late
,
to
quit
the
house
that
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
indeed
account
somewhat
unfairly
for
this
sudden
change
;
for
*NL*
besides
some
hard
and
unjust
surmises
concerning
female
fickleness
and
*NL*
mutability
,
he
began
to
suspect
that
he
owed
this
want
of
civility
to
*NL*
his
want
of
horses
;
a
sort
of
animals
which
,
as
they
dirty
no
sheets
,
*NL*
are
thought
in
inns
to
pay
better
for
their
beds
than
their
riders
,
*NL*
and
are
therefore
considered
as
the
more
desirable
company
;
but
Mrs
*NL*
Whitefield
,
to
do
her
justice
,
had
a
much
more
liberal
way
of
*NL*
thinking
.
She
was
perfectly
well-bred
,
and
could
be
very
civil
to
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
though
he
walked
on
foot
.
In
reality
,
she
looked
on
our
*NL*
heroe
as
a
sorry
scoundrel
,
and
therefore
treated
him
as
such
,
for
*NL*
which
not
even
Jones
himself
,
had
he
known
as
much
as
the
reader
,
*NL*
could
have
blamed
her
;
nay
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
must
have
approved
her
*NL*
conduct
,
and
have
esteemed
her
the
more
for
the
disrespect
shown
*NL*
towards
himself
.
This
is
indeed
a
most
aggravating
circumstance
,
which
*NL*
attends
depriving
men
unjustly
of
their
reputation
;
for
a
man
who
is
*NL*
conscious
of
having
an
ill
character
,
can
not
justly
be
angry
with
*NL*
those
who
neglect
and
slight
him
;
but
ought
rather
to
despise
such
as
*NL*
affect
his
conversation
,
unless
where
a
perfect
intimacy
must
have
*NL*
convinced
them
that
their
friend
's
character
hath
been
falsely
and
*NL*
injuriously
aspersed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
,
however
,
the
case
of
Jones
;
for
as
he
was
a
perfect
*NL*
stranger
to
the
truth
,
so
he
was
with
good
reason
offended
at
the
*NL*
treatment
he
received
.
He
therefore
paid
his
reckoning
and
departed
,
*NL*
highly
against
the
will
of
Mr
Partridge
,
who
having
remonstrated
much
*NL*
against
it
to
no
purpose
,
at
last
condescended
to
take
up
his
knapsack
*NL*
and
to
attend
his
friend
.

*NL*
Chapter
ix
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
several
dialogues
between
Jones
and
Partridge
,
concerning
*NL*
love
,
cold
,
hunger
,
and
other
matters
;
with
the
lucky
and
narrow
*NL*
escape
of
Partridge
,
as
he
was
on
the
very
brink
of
making
a
fatal
*NL*
discovery
to
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
shadows
began
now
to
descend
larger
from
the
high
mountains
;
the
*NL*
feathered
creation
had
betaken
themselves
to
their
rest
.
Now
the
*NL*
highest
order
of
mortals
were
sitting
down
to
their
dinners
,
and
the
*NL*
lowest
order
to
their
suppers
.
In
a
word
,
the
clock
struck
five
just
*NL*
as
Mr
Jones
took
his
leave
of
Gloucester
;
an
hour
at
which
-LRB-
as
it
was
*NL*
now
mid-winter
-RRB-
the
dirty
fingers
of
Night
would
have
drawn
her
sable
*NL*
curtain
over
the
universe
,
had
not
the
moon
forbid
her
,
who
now
,
with
*NL*
a
face
as
broad
and
as
red
as
those
of
some
jolly
mortals
,
who
,
like
*NL*
her
,
turn
night
into
day
,
began
to
rise
from
her
bed
,
where
she
had
*NL*
slumbered
away
the
day
,
in
order
to
sit
up
all
night
.
Jones
had
not
*NL*
travelled
far
before
he
paid
his
compliments
to
that
beautiful
planet
,
*NL*
and
,
turning
to
his
companion
,
asked
him
if
he
had
ever
beheld
so
*NL*
delicious
an
evening
?
Partridge
making
no
ready
answer
to
his
*NL*
question
,
he
proceeded
to
comment
on
the
beauty
of
the
moon
,
and
*NL*
repeated
some
passages
from
Milton
,
who
hath
certainly
excelled
all
*NL*
other
poets
in
his
description
of
the
heavenly
luminaries
.
He
then
*NL*
told
Partridge
the
story
from
the
Spectator
,
of
two
lovers
who
had
*NL*
agreed
to
entertain
themselves
when
they
were
at
a
great
distance
from
*NL*
each
other
,
by
repairing
,
at
a
certain
fixed
hour
,
to
look
at
the
*NL*
moon
;
thus
pleasing
themselves
with
the
thought
that
they
were
both
*NL*
employed
in
contemplating
the
same
object
at
the
same
time
.
``
Those
*NL*
lovers
,
''
added
he
,
``
must
have
had
souls
truly
capable
of
feeling
all
*NL*
the
tenderness
of
the
sublimest
of
all
human
passions
.
''
--
``
Very
*NL*
probably
,
''
cries
Partridge
:
``
but
I
envy
them
more
,
if
they
had
bodies
*NL*
incapable
of
feeling
cold
;
for
I
am
almost
frozen
to
death
,
and
am
*NL*
very
much
afraid
I
shall
lose
a
piece
of
my
nose
before
we
get
to
*NL*
another
house
of
entertainment
.
Nay
,
truly
,
we
may
well
expect
some
*NL*
judgment
should
happen
to
us
for
our
folly
in
running
away
so
by
night
*NL*
from
one
of
the
most
excellent
inns
I
ever
set
my
foot
into
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
I
never
saw
more
good
things
in
my
life
,
and
the
greatest
lord
in
the
*NL*
land
can
not
live
better
in
his
own
house
than
he
may
there
.
And
to
*NL*
forsake
such
a
house
,
and
go
a
rambling
about
the
country
,
the
Lord
*NL*
knows
whither
,
_
per
devia
rura
viarum
_
,
I
say
nothing
for
my
part
;
but
*NL*
some
people
might
not
have
charity
enough
to
conclude
we
were
in
our
*NL*
sober
senses
.
''
--
``
Fie
upon
it
,
Mr
Partridge
!
''
says
Jones
,
``
have
a
*NL*
better
heart
;
consider
you
are
going
to
face
an
enemy
;
and
are
you
*NL*
afraid
of
facing
a
little
cold
?
I
wish
,
indeed
,
we
had
a
guide
to
*NL*
advise
which
of
these
roads
we
should
take
.
''
--
``
May
I
be
so
bold
,
''
says
*NL*
Partridge
,
``
to
offer
my
advice
?
_
Interdum
stultus
opportuna

_
''
--
``
Why
,
which
of
them
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
would
you
*NL*
recommend
?
''
--
``
Truly
neither
of
them
,
''
answered
Partridge
.
``
The
only
*NL*
road
we
can
be
certain
of
finding
,
is
the
road
we
came
.
A
good
hearty
*NL*
pace
will
bring
us
back
to
Gloucester
in
an
hour
;
but
if
we
go
*NL*
forward
,
the
Lord
Harry
knows
when
we
shall
arrive
at
any
place
;
for
I
*NL*
see
at
least
fifty
miles
before
me
,
and
no
house
in
all
the
*NL*
way
.
''
--
``
You
see
,
indeed
,
a
very
fair
prospect
,
''
says
Jones
,
``
which
*NL*
receives
great
additional
beauty
from
the
extreme
lustre
of
the
moon
.
*NL*
However
,
I
will
keep
the
left-hand
track
,
as
that
seems
to
lead
*NL*
directly
to
those
hills
,
which
we
were
informed
lie
not
far
from
*NL*
Worcester
.
And
here
,
if
you
are
inclined
to
quit
me
,
you
may
,
and
*NL*
return
back
again
;
but
for
my
part
,
I
am
resolved
to
go
forward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
unkind
in
you
,
sir
,
''
says
Partridge
,
``
to
suspect
me
of
any
such
*NL*
intention
.
What
I
have
advised
hath
been
as
much
on
your
account
as
on
*NL*
my
own
:
but
since
you
are
determined
to
go
on
,
I
am
as
much
determined
*NL*
to
follow
.
_
I
prae

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
travelled
some
miles
without
speaking
to
each
other
,
during
*NL*
which
suspense
of
discourse
Jones
often
sighed
,
and
Benjamin
groaned
*NL*
as
bitterly
,
though
from
a
very
different
reason
.
At
length
Jones
made
*NL*
a
full
stop
,
and
turning
about
,
cries
,
``
Who
knows
,
Partridge
,
but
the
*NL*
loveliest
creature
in
the
universe
may
have
her
eyes
now
fixed
on
that
*NL*
very
moon
which
I
behold
at
this
instant
?
''
``
Very
likely
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
answered
Partridge
;
``
and
if
my
eyes
were
fixed
on
a
good
surloin
of
*NL*
roast
beef
,
the
devil
might
take
the
moon
and
her
horns
into
the
*NL*
bargain
.
''
``
Did
ever
Tramontane
make
such
an
answer
?
''
cries
Jones
.
*NL*
``
Prithee
,
Partridge
,
wast
thou
ever
susceptible
of
love
in
thy
life
,
*NL*
or
hath
time
worn
away
all
the
traces
of
it
from
thy
memory

*NL*
``
Alack-a-day
!

cries
Partridge
,

well
would
it
have
been

I

never
known

love
was

I
am
sure
I
have
tasted
all
the
tenderness

*NL*
and
bitternesses
of
the
passion

''
``
Was
your
mistress
unkind
,
then
?
''
*NL*
says
Jones
.
``
Very
unkind
,
indeed
,
sir
,
''
answered
Partridge
;
``
for
she
*NL*
married
me
,
and
made
one
of
the
most
confounded
wives
in
the
world

*NL*
However
,
heaven
be
praised
,
she
's
gone
;
and
if
I
believed
she
was
in
*NL*
the
moon
,
according
to
a
book
I
once
read
,
which
teaches
that
to
be
*NL*
the
receptacle
of
departed
spirits
,
I
would
never
look
at
it
for
fear
*NL*
of
seeing
her
;
but
I
wish
,
sir
,
that
the
moon
was
a
looking-glass
for
*NL*
your
sake
,
and
that
Miss
Sophia
Western
was
now
placed
before
it
.
''
``
My
*NL*
dear
Partridge
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
what
a
thought
was
there
!
A
thought
*NL*
which
I
am
certain
could
never
have
entered
into
any
mind

that
of
*NL*
a
lover

O
Partridge

could
I
hope
once
again
to
see
that
face
;

,
*NL*
alas
!
all
those
golden
dreams
are
vanished
for
ever

my
only
*NL*
refuge
from
future
misery
is
to
forget
the
object
of
all
my
former
*NL*
happiness

''
``
And
do
you
really
despair
of
ever
seeing
Miss
Western

again

Partridge
;
``
if

will
follow
my
advice
I
will

not

``
Ha

not

Jones
:

I

sufficiently
to
conquer
all

Partridge

``
Well

Jones

proceed

likely

ramble
about

``
I
have
already
told
you
my
resolution

go
on

Jones
;
``

I
would
have
you
go
back

I
am
obliged

*NL*
you

your
company
hither

I
beg
you
to
accept
a
guinea
as
a

small
instance
of
my
gratitude

Nay

it
would
be
cruel
in
me
to
suffer

you
to
go
any
farther
;
for

to
deal
plainly
with
you

my
chief
end

a
glorious
death
in
the
service
of
my
king

``
As

for
your
money

replied
Partridge
,
``
I
beg

sir

you
will
put
it
up

receive
none

I
am

I

the

mine

now
my

absolutely

desperate

I

no

And
,
indeed
,
I
have
the
comfort
to
think
there
*NL*
will
be

little
danger

for
a
popish
priest
told
me
the
other
day

the
business
would
soon
be
over

he
believed
without

Jones

I

Yes

so
far

answered
the
other
,

from

assured
me

not

gainers

the
*NL*
change

for
that
Prince
Charles
was
as
good

any
in

England
;

that
nothing

regard
to

made
him

the
rest

popish
party
to
be
Jacobites

''
says
Jones
;
``
and
I
make
no
*NL*
doubt
of
our
success
,
but
not
without
a
battle
.
So
that
I
am
not
so
*NL*
sanguine
as
your
friend
the
popish
priest
.
''
``
Nay
,
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
answered
Partridge
,
``
all
the
prophecies
I
have
ever
read
speak
of
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
blood
to
be
spilt
in
the
quarrel
,
and
the
miller
with
*NL*
three
thumbs
,
who
is
now
alive
,
is
to
hold
the
horses
of
three
kings
,
*NL*
up
to
his
knees
in
blood
.
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
us
all
,
and
send
*NL*
better
times
!
''
``
With
what
stuff
and
nonsense
hast
thou
filled
thy
*NL*
head
!
''
answered
Jones
:
``
this
too
,
I
suppose
,
comes
from
the
popish
*NL*
priest
.
Monsters
and
prodigies
are
the
proper
arguments
to
support
*NL*
monstrous
and
absurd
doctrines
.
The
cause
of
King
George
is
the
cause
*NL*
of
liberty
and
true
religion
.
In
other
words
,
it
is
the
cause
of
*NL*
common
sense
,
my
boy
,
and
I
warrant
you
will
succeed
,
though
Briarius
*NL*
himself
was
to
rise
again
with
his
hundred
thumbs
,
and
to
turn
*NL*
miller
.
''
Partridge
made
no
reply
to
this
.
He
was
,
indeed
,
cast
into
*NL*
the
utmost
confusion
by
this
declaration
of
Jones
.
For
,
to
inform
the
*NL*
reader
of
a
secret
,
which
he
had
no
proper
opportunity
of
revealing
*NL*
before
,
Partridge
was
in
truth
a
Jacobite
,
and
had
concluded
that
*NL*
Jones
was
of
the
same
party
,
and
was
now
proceeding
to
join
the
*NL*
rebels
.
An
opinion
which
was
not
without
foundation
.
For
the
tall
,
*NL*
long-sided
dame
,
mentioned
by
Hudibras
--
that
many-eyed
,
many-tongued
,
*NL*
many-mouthed
,
many-eared
monster
of
Virgil
,
had
related
the
story
of
*NL*
the
quarrel
between
Jones
and
the
officer
,
with
the
usual
regard
to
*NL*
truth
.
She
had
,
indeed
,
changed
the
name
of
Sophia
into
that
of
the
*NL*
Pretender
,
and
had
reported
,
that
drinking
his
health
was
the
cause
*NL*
for
which
Jones
was
knocked
down
.
This
Partridge
had
heard
,
and
most
*NL*
firmly
believed
.
'T
is
no
wonder
,
therefore
,
that
he
had
thence
*NL*
entertained
the
above-mentioned
opinion
of
Jones
;
and
which
he
had
*NL*
almost
discovered
to
him
before
he
found
out
his
own
mistake
.
And
at
*NL*
this
the
reader
will
be
the
less
inclined
to
wonder
,
if
he
pleases
to
*NL*
recollect
the
doubtful
phrase
in
which
Jones
first
communicated
his
*NL*
resolution
to
Mr
Partridge
;
and
,
indeed
,
had
the
words
been
less
*NL*
ambiguous
,
Partridge
might
very
well
have
construed
them
as
he
did
;
*NL*
being
persuaded
as
he
was
that
the
whole
nation
were
of
the
same
*NL*
inclination
in
their
hearts
;
nor
did
it
stagger
him
that
Jones
had
*NL*
travelled
in
the
company
of
soldiers
;
for
he
had
the
same
opinion
of
*NL*
the
army
which
he
had
of
the
rest
of
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
however
well
affected
he
might
be
to
James
or
Charles
,
he
was
*NL*
still
much
more
attached
to
Little
Benjamin
than
to
either
;
for
which
*NL*
reason
he
no
sooner
discovered
the
principles
of
his
fellow-traveller
*NL*
than
he
thought
proper
to
conceal
and
outwardly
give
up
his
own
to
the
*NL*
man
on
whom
he
depended
for
the
making
his
fortune
,
since
he
by
no
*NL*
means
believed
the
affairs
of
Jones
to
be
so
desperate
as
they
really
*NL*
were
with
Mr
Allworthy
;
for
as
he
had
kept
a
constant
correspondence
*NL*
with
some
of
his
neighbours
since
he
left
that
country
,
he
had
heard
*NL*
much
,
indeed
more
than
was
true
,
of
the
great
affection
Mr
Allworthy
*NL*
bore
this
young
man
,
who
,
as
Partridge
had
been
instructed
,
was
to
be
*NL*
that
gentleman
's
heir
,
and
whom
,
as
we
have
said
,
he
did
not
in
the
*NL*
least
doubt
to
be
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
imagined
therefore
that
whatever
quarrel
was
between
them
,
it
would
*NL*
be
certainly
made
up
at
the
return
of
Mr
Jones
;
an
event
from
which
he
*NL*
promised
great
advantages
,
if
he
could
take
this
opportunity
of
*NL*
ingratiating
himself
with
that
young
gentleman
;
and
if
he
could
by
any
*NL*
means
be
instrumental
in
procuring
his
return
,
he
doubted
not
,
as
we
*NL*
have
before
said
,
but
it
would
as
highly
advance
him
in
the
favour
of
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
already
observed
,
that
he
was
a
very
good-natured
fellow
,
and
*NL*
he
hath
himself
declared
the
violent
attachment
he
had
to
the
person
*NL*
and
character
of
Jones
;
but
possibly
the
views
which
I
have
just
*NL*
before
mentioned
,
might
likewise
have
some
little
share
in
prompting
*NL*
him
to
undertake
this
expedition
,
at
least
in
urging
him
to
continue
*NL*
it
,
after
he
had
discovered
that
his
master
and
himself
,
like
some
*NL*
prudent
fathers
and
sons
,
though
they
travelled
together
in
great
*NL*
friendship
,
had
embraced
opposite
parties
.
I
am
led
into
this
*NL*
conjecture
,
by
having
remarked
,
that
though
love
,
friendship
,
esteem
,
*NL*
and
such
like
,
have
very
powerful
operations
in
the
human
mind
;
*NL*
interest
,
however
,
is
an
ingredient
seldom
omitted
by
wise
men
,
when
*NL*
they
would
work
others
to
their
own
purposes
.
This
is
indeed
a
most
*NL*
excellent
medicine
,
and
,
like
Ward
's
pill
,
flies
at
once
to
the
*NL*
particular
part
of
the
body
on
which
you
desire
to
operate
,
whether
it
*NL*
be
the
tongue
,
the
hand
,
or
any
other
member
,
where
it
scarce
ever
*NL*
fails
of
immediately
producing
the
desired
effect
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
x
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
our
travellers
meet
with
a
very
extraordinary
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
Jones
and
his
friend
came
to
the
end
of
their
dialogue
in
the
*NL*
preceding
chapter
,
they
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
a
very
steep
hill
.
*NL*
Here
Jones
stopt
short
,
and
directing
his
eyes
upwards
,
stood
for
a
*NL*
while
silent
.
At
length
he
called
to
his
companion
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Partridge
,
I
wish
I
was
at
the
top
of
this
hill
;
it
must
certainly
*NL*
afford
a
most
charming
prospect
,
especially
by
this
light
;
for
the
*NL*
solemn
gloom
which
the
moon
casts
on
all
objects
,
is
beyond
expression
*NL*
beautiful
,
especially
to
an
imagination
which
is
desirous
of
*NL*
cultivating
melancholy
ideas
.
''
--
``
Very
probably
,
''
answered
Partridge
;
*NL*
``
but
if
the
top
of
the
hill
be
properest
to
produce
melancholy
*NL*
thoughts
,
I
suppose
the
bottom
is
the
likeliest
to
produce
merry
ones
,
*NL*
and
these
I
take
to
be
much
the
better
of
the
two
.
I
protest
you
have
*NL*
made
my
blood
run
cold
with
the
very
mentioning
the
top
of
that
*NL*
mountain
;
which
seems
to
me
to
be
one
of
the
highest
in
the
world
.
No
,
*NL*
no
,
if
we
look
for
anything
,
let
it
be
for
a
place
under
ground
,
to
*NL*
screen
ourselves
from
the
frost
.
''
--
``
Do
so
,
''
said
Jones
;
``
let
it
be
but
*NL*
within
hearing
of
this
place
,
and
I
will
hallow
to
you
at
my
return
*NL*
back
.
''
--
``
Surely
,
sir
,
you
are
not
mad
,
''
said
Partridge
.
--
``
Indeed
,
I
*NL*
am
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
if
ascending
this
hill
be
madness
;
but
as
you
*NL*
complain
so
much
of
the
cold
already
,
I
would
have
you
stay
below
.
I
*NL*
will
certainly
return
to
you
within
an
hour
.
''
--
``
Pardon
me
,
sir
,
''
cries
*NL*
Partridge
;
``
I
have
determined
to
follow
you
wherever
you
go
.
''
Indeed
*NL*
he
was
now
afraid
to
stay
behind
;
for
though
he
was
coward
enough
in
*NL*
all
respects
,
yet
his
chief
fear
was
that
of
ghosts
,
with
which
the
*NL*
present
time
of
night
,
and
the
wildness
of
the
place
,
extremely
well
*NL*
suited
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
Partridge
espied
a
glimmering
light
through
some
*NL*
trees
,
which
seemed
very
near
to
them
.
He
immediately
cried
out
in
a
*NL*
rapture
,
``
Oh
,
sir
!
Heaven
hath
at
last
heard
my
prayers
,
and
hath
*NL*
brought
us
to
a
house
;
perhaps
it
may
be
an
inn
.
Let
me
beseech
you
,
*NL*
sir
,
if
you
have
any
compassion
either
for
me
or
yourself
,
do
not
*NL*
despise
the
goodness
of
Providence
,
but
let
us
go
directly
to
yon
*NL*
light
.
Whether
it
be
a
public-house
or
no
,
I
am
sure
if
they
be
*NL*
Christians
that
dwell
there
,
they
will
not
refuse
a
little
house-room
*NL*
to
persons
in
our
miserable
condition
.
''
Jones
at
length
yielded
to
the
*NL*
earnest
supplications
of
Partridge
,
and
both
together
made
directly
*NL*
towards
the
place
whence
the
light
issued
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
soon
arrived
at
the
door
of
this
house
,
or
cottage
,
for
it
might
*NL*
be
called
either
,
without
much
impropriety
.
Here
Jones
knocked
several
*NL*
times
without
receiving
any
answer
from
within
;
at
which
Partridge
,
*NL*
whose
head
was
full
of
nothing
but
of
ghosts
,
devils
,
witches
,
and
*NL*
such
like
,
began
to
tremble
,
crying
,
``
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
us
!
surely
*NL*
the
people
must
be
all
dead
.
I
can
see
no
light
neither
now
,
and
yet
I
*NL*
am
certain
I
saw
a
candle
burning
but
a
moment
before
.
--
Well
!
I
have
*NL*
heard
of
such
things
.
''
--
``
What
hast
thou
heard
of
?
''
said
Jones
.
``
The
*NL*
people
are
either
fast
asleep
,
or
probably
,
as
this
is
a
lonely
place
,
*NL*
are
afraid
to
open
their
door
.
''
He
then
began
to
vociferate
pretty
*NL*
loudly
,
and
at
last
an
old
woman
,
opening
an
upper
casement
,
asked
,
*NL*
Who
they
were
,
and
what
they
wanted
?
Jones
answered
,
They
were
*NL*
travellers
who
had
lost
their
way
,
and
having
seen
a
light
in
the
*NL*
window
,
had
been
led
thither
in
hopes
of
finding
some
fire
to
warm
*NL*
themselves
.
``
Whoever
you
are
,
''
cries
the
woman
,
``
you
have
no
business
*NL*
here
;
nor
shall
I
open
the
door
to
any
one
at
this
time
of
night
.
''
*NL*
Partridge
,
whom
the
sound
of
a
human
voice
had
recovered
from
his
*NL*
fright
,
fell
to
the
most
earnest
supplications
to
be
admitted
for
a
*NL*
few
minutes
to
the
fire
,
saying
,
he
was
almost
dead
with
the
cold
;
to
*NL*
which
fear
had
indeed
contributed
equally
with
the
frost
.
He
assured
*NL*
her
that
the
gentleman
who
spoke
to
her
was
one
of
the
greatest
*NL*
squires
in
the
country
;
and
made
use
of
every
argument
,
save
one
,
*NL*
which
Jones
afterwards
effectually
added
;
and
this
was
,
the
promise
of
*NL*
half-a-crown
;
--
a
bribe
too
great
to
be
resisted
by
such
a
person
,
*NL*
especially
as
the
genteel
appearance
of
Jones
,
which
the
light
of
the
*NL*
moon
plainly
discovered
to
her
,
together
with
his
affable
behaviour
,
*NL*
had
entirely
subdued
those
apprehensions
of
thieves
which
she
had
at
*NL*
first
conceived
.
She
agreed
,
therefore
,
at
last
,
to
let
them
in
;
where
*NL*
Partridge
,
to
his
infinite
joy
,
found
a
good
fire
ready
for
his
*NL*
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
fellow
,
however
,
had
no
sooner
warmed
himself
,
than
those
*NL*
thoughts
which
were
always
uppermost
in
his
mind
,
began
a
little
to
*NL*
disturb
his
brain
.
There
was
no
article
of
his
creed
in
which
he
had
a
*NL*
stronger
faith
than
he
had
in
witchcraft
,
nor
can
the
reader
conceive
*NL*
a
figure
more
adapted
to
inspire
this
idea
,
than
the
old
woman
who
now
*NL*
stood
before
him
.
She
answered
exactly
to
that
picture
drawn
by
Otway
*NL*
in
his
Orphan
.
Indeed
,
if
this
woman
had
lived
in
the
reign
of
James
*NL*
the
First
,
her
appearance
alone
would
have
hanged
her
,
almost
without
*NL*
any
evidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
circumstances
likewise
conspired
to
confirm
Partridge
in
his
*NL*
opinion
.
Her
living
,
as
he
then
imagined
,
by
herself
in
so
lonely
a
*NL*
place
;
and
in
a
house
,
the
outside
of
which
seemed
much
too
good
for
*NL*
her
,
but
its
inside
was
furnished
in
the
most
neat
and
elegant
manner
.
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
Jones
himself
was
not
a
little
surprized
at
what
he
*NL*
saw
;
for
,
besides
the
extraordinary
neatness
of
the
room
,
it
was
*NL*
adorned
with
a
great
number
of
nicknacks
and
curiosities
,
which
might
*NL*
have
engaged
the
attention
of
a
virtuoso
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Jones
was
admiring
these
things
,
and
Partridge
sat
trembling
*NL*
with
the
firm
belief
that
he
was
in
the
house
of
a
witch
,
the
old
*NL*
woman
said
,
``
I
hope
,
gentlemen
,
you
will
make
what
haste
you
can
;
for
*NL*
I
expect
my
master
presently
,
and
I
would
not
for
double
the
money
he
*NL*
should
find
you
here
.
''
--
``
Then
you
have
a
master
?
''
cried
Jones
.
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
you
will
excuse
me
,
good
woman
,
but
I
was
surprized
to
see
*NL*
all
those
fine
things
in
your
house
.
''
--
``
Ah
,
sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
if
the
*NL*
twentieth
part
of
these
things
were
mine
,
I
should
think
myself
a
rich
*NL*
woman
.
But
pray
,
sir
,
do
not
stay
much
longer
,
for
I
look
for
him
in
*NL*
every
minute
.
''
--
``
Why
,
sure
he
would
not
be
angry
with
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Jones
,
``
for
doing
a
common
act
of
charity
?
''
--
``
Alack-a-day
,
sir
!
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
he
is
a
strange
man
,
not
at
all
like
other
people
.
He
keeps
no
*NL*
company
with
anybody
,
and
seldom
walks
out
but
by
night
,
for
he
doth
*NL*
not
care
to
be
seen
;
and
all
the
country
people
are
as
much
afraid
of
*NL*
meeting
him
;
for
his
dress
is
enough
to
frighten
those
who
are
not
*NL*
used
to
it
.
They
call
him
,
the
Man
of
the
Hill
-LRB-
for
there
he
walks
by
*NL*
night
-RRB-
,
and
the
country
people
are
not
,
I
believe
,
more
afraid
of
the
*NL*
devil
himself
.
He
would
be
terribly
angry
if
he
found
you
*NL*
here
.
''
--
``
Pray
,
sir
,
''
says
Partridge
,
``
do
n't
let
us
offend
the
*NL*
gentleman
;
I
am
ready
to
walk
,
and
was
never
warmer
in
my
life
.
Do
*NL*
pray
,
sir
,
let
us
go
.
Here
are
pistols
over
the
chimney
:
who
knows
*NL*
whether
they
be
charged
or
no
,
or
what
he
may
do
with
them
?
''
--
``
Fear
*NL*
nothing
,
Partridge
,
''
cries
Jones
;
``
I
will
secure
thee
from
*NL*
danger
.
''
--
``
Nay
,
for
matter
o
'
that
,
he
never
doth
any
mischief
,
''
said
*NL*
the
woman
;
``
but
to
be
sure
it
is
necessary
he
should
keep
some
arms
*NL*
for
his
own
safety
;
for
his
house
hath
been
beset
more
than
once
;
and
*NL*
it
is
not
many
nights
ago
that
we
thought
we
heard
thieves
about
it
:
*NL*
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
often
wondered
that
he
is
not
murdered
by
some
*NL*
villain
or
other
,
as
he
walks
out
by
himself
at
such
hours
;
but
then
,
*NL*
as
I
said
,
the
people
are
afraid
of
him
;
and
besides
,
they
think
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
he
hath
nothing
about
him
worth
taking
.
''
--
``
I
should
imagine
,
*NL*
by
this
collection
of
rarities
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
that
your
master
had
*NL*
been
a
traveller
.
''
--
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
answered
she
,
``
he
hath
been
a
very
*NL*
great
one
:
there
be
few
gentlemen
that
know
more
of
all
matters
than
*NL*
he
.
I
fancy
he
hath
been
crost
in
love
,
or
whatever
it
is
I
know
not
;
*NL*
but
I
have
lived
with
him
above
these
thirty
years
,
and
in
all
that
*NL*
time
he
hath
hardly
spoke
to
six
living
people
.
''
She
then
again
*NL*
solicited
their
departure
,
in
which
she
was
backed
by
Partridge
;
but
*NL*
Jones
purposely
protracted
the
time
,
for
his
curiosity
was
greatly
*NL*
raised
to
see
this
extraordinary
person
.
Though
the
old
woman
,
*NL*
therefore
,
concluded
every
one
of
her
answers
with
desiring
him
to
be
*NL*
gone
,
and
Partridge
proceeded
so
far
as
to
pull
him
by
the
sleeve
,
he
*NL*
still
continued
to
invent
new
questions
,
till
the
old
woman
,
with
an
*NL*
affrighted
countenance
,
declared
she
heard
her
master
's
signal
;
and
at
*NL*
the
same
instant
more
than
one
voice
was
heard
without
the
door
,
*NL*
crying
,
``
D
--
n
your
blood
,
show
us
your
money
this
instant
.
Your
money
,
*NL*
you
villain
,
or
we
will
blow
your
brains
about
your
ears
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
good
heaven
!
''
cries
the
old
woman
,
``
some
villains
,
to
be
sure
,
*NL*
have
attacked
my
master
.
O
la
!
what
shall
I
do
?
what
shall
I
*NL*
do
?
''
--
``
How
!
''
cries
Jones
,
``
how
!
--
Are
these
pistols
loaded
?
''
--
``
O
,
good
*NL*
sir
,
there
is
nothing
in
them
,
indeed
.
O
pray
do
n't
murder
us
,
*NL*
gentlemen
!
''
-LRB-
for
in
reality
she
now
had
the
same
opinion
of
those
*NL*
within
as
she
had
of
those
without
-RRB-
.
Jones
made
her
no
answer
;
but
*NL*
snatching
an
old
broad
sword
which
hung
in
the
room
,
he
instantly
*NL*
sallied
out
,
where
he
found
the
old
gentleman
struggling
with
two
*NL*
ruffians
,
and
begging
for
mercy
.
Jones
asked
no
questions
,
but
fell
so
*NL*
briskly
to
work
with
his
broad
sword
,
that
the
fellows
immediately
*NL*
quitted
their
hold
;
and
without
offering
to
attack
our
heroe
,
betook
*NL*
themselves
to
their
heels
and
made
their
escape
;
for
he
did
not
*NL*
attempt
to
pursue
them
,
being
contented
with
having
delivered
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
;
and
indeed
he
concluded
he
had
pretty
well
done
their
*NL*
business
,
for
both
of
them
,
as
they
ran
off
,
cried
out
with
bitter
*NL*
oaths
that
they
were
dead
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
presently
ran
to
lift
up
the
old
gentleman
,
who
had
been
thrown
*NL*
down
in
the
scuffle
,
expressing
at
the
same
time
great
concern
lest
he
*NL*
should
have
received
any
harm
from
the
villains
.
The
old
man
stared
a
*NL*
moment
at
Jones
,
and
then
cried
,
``
No
,
sir
,
no
,
I
have
very
little
*NL*
harm
,
I
thank
you
.
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
''
--
``
I
see
,
sir
,
''
said
*NL*
Jones
,
``
you
are
not
free
from
apprehensions
even
of
those
who
have
had
*NL*
the
happiness
to
be
your
deliverers
;
nor
can
I
blame
any
suspicions
*NL*
which
you
may
have
;
but
indeed
you
have
no
real
occasion
for
any
;
here
*NL*
are
none
but
your
friends
present
.
Having
mist
our
way
this
cold
*NL*
night
,
we
took
the
liberty
of
warming
ourselves
at
your
fire
,
whence
*NL*
we
were
just
departing
when
we
heard
you
call
for
assistance
,
which
,
I
*NL*
must
say
,
Providence
alone
seems
to
have
sent
you
.
''
--
``
Providence
,
*NL*
indeed
,
''
cries
the
old
gentleman
,
``
if
it
be
so
.
''
--
``
So
it
is
,
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
''
cries
Jones
.
``
Here
is
your
own
sword
,
sir
;
I
have
used
it
in
*NL*
your
defence
,
and
I
now
return
it
into
your
hand
.
''
The
old
man
having
*NL*
received
the
sword
,
which
was
stained
with
the
blood
of
his
enemies
,
*NL*
looked
stedfastly
at
Jones
during
some
moments
,
and
then
with
a
sigh
*NL*
cried
out
,
``
You
will
pardon
me
,
young
gentleman
;
I
was
not
always
of
a
*NL*
suspicious
temper
,
nor
am
I
a
friend
to
ingratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
thankful
then
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
to
that
Providence
to
which
you
owe
*NL*
your
deliverance
:
as
to
my
part
,
I
have
only
discharged
the
common
*NL*
duties
of
humanity
,
and
what
I
would
have
done
for
any
fellow-creature
*NL*
in
your
situation
.
''
--
``
Let
me
look
at
you
a
little
longer
,
''
cries
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
.
``
You
are
a
human
creature
then
?
Well
,
perhaps
you
are
.
*NL*
Come
pray
walk
into
my
little
hutt
.
You
have
been
my
deliverer
*NL*
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
was
distracted
between
the
fears
which
she
had
of
her
*NL*
master
,
and
for
him
;
and
Partridge
was
,
if
possible
,
in
a
greater
*NL*
fright
.
The
former
of
these
,
however
,
when
she
heard
her
master
speak
*NL*
kindly
to
Jones
,
and
perceived
what
had
happened
,
came
again
to
*NL*
herself
;
but
Partridge
no
sooner
saw
the
gentleman
,
than
the
*NL*
strangeness
of
his
dress
infused
greater
terrors
into
that
poor
fellow
*NL*
than
he
had
before
felt
,
either
from
the
strange
description
which
he
*NL*
had
heard
,
or
from
the
uproar
which
had
happened
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
it
was
an
appearance
which
might
have
affected
a
*NL*
more
constant
mind
than
that
of
Mr
Partridge
.
This
person
was
of
the
*NL*
tallest
size
,
with
a
long
beard
as
white
as
snow
.
His
body
was
*NL*
cloathed
with
the
skin
of
an
ass
,
made
something
into
the
form
of
a
*NL*
coat
.
He
wore
likewise
boots
on
his
legs
,
and
a
cap
on
his
head
,
both
*NL*
composed
of
the
skin
of
some
other
animals
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
old
gentleman
came
into
his
house
,
the
old
woman
began
*NL*
her
congratulations
on
his
happy
escape
from
the
ruffians
.
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
cried
he
,
``
I
have
escaped
,
indeed
,
thanks
to
my
preserver
.
''
--
``
O
the
*NL*
blessing
on
him
!
''
answered
she
:
``
he
is
a
good
gentleman
,
I
warrant
*NL*
him
.
I
was
afraid
your
worship
would
have
been
angry
with
me
for
*NL*
letting
him
in
;
and
to
be
certain
I
should
not
have
done
it
,
had
not
I
*NL*
seen
by
the
moon-light
,
that
he
was
a
gentleman
,
and
almost
frozen
to
*NL*
death
.
And
to
be
certain
it
must
have
been
some
good
angel
that
sent
*NL*
him
hither
,
and
tempted
me
to
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
,
sir
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
to
Jones
,
``
that
I
have
*NL*
nothing
in
this
house
which
you
can
either
eat
or
drink
,
unless
you
*NL*
will
accept
a
dram
of
brandy
;
of
which
I
can
give
you
some
most
*NL*
excellent
,
and
which
I
have
had
by
me
these
thirty
years
.
''
Jones
*NL*
declined
this
offer
in
a
very
civil
and
proper
speech
,
and
then
the
*NL*
other
asked
him
,
``
Whither
he
was
travelling
when
he
mist
his
way
?
''
*NL*
saying
,
``
I
must
own
myself
surprized
to
see
such
a
person
as
you
*NL*
appear
to
be
,
journeying
on
foot
at
this
time
of
night
.
I
suppose
,
*NL*
sir
,
you
are
a
gentleman
of
these
parts
;
for
you
do
not
look
like
one
*NL*
who
is
used
to
travel
far
without
horses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Appearances
,
''
cried
Jones
,
``
are
often
deceitful
;
men
sometimes
look
*NL*
what
they
are
not
.
I
assure
you
I
am
not
of
this
country
;
and
whither
*NL*
I
am
travelling
,
in
reality
I
scarce
know
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whoever
you
are
,
or
whithersoever
you
are
going
,
''
answered
the
old
*NL*
man
,
``
I
have
obligations
to
you
which
I
can
never
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
once
more
,
''
replied
Jones
,
``
affirm
that
you
have
none
;
for
there
*NL*
can
be
no
merit
in
having
hazarded
that
in
your
service
on
which
I
set
*NL*
no
value
;
and
nothing
is
so
contemptible
in
my
eyes
as
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
young
gentleman
,
''
answered
the
stranger
,
``
that
you
have
*NL*
any
reason
to
be
so
unhappy
at
your
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
am
,
sir
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
the
most
unhappy
of
*NL*
mankind
.
''
--
``
Perhaps
you
have
had
a
friend
,
or
a
mistress
?
''
replied
the
*NL*
other
.
``
How
could
you
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
mention
two
words
sufficient
to
*NL*
drive
me
to
distraction
?
''
--
``
Either
of
them
are
enough
to
drive
any
man
*NL*
to
distraction
,
''
answered
the
old
man
.
``
I
enquire
no
farther
,
sir
;
*NL*
perhaps
my
curiosity
hath
led
me
too
far
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
I
can
not
censure
a
passion
which
I
feel
*NL*
at
this
instant
in
the
highest
degree
.
You
will
pardon
me
when
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
that
everything
which
I
have
seen
or
heard
since
I
first
*NL*
entered
this
house
hath
conspired
to
raise
the
greatest
curiosity
in
*NL*
me
.
Something
very
extraordinary
must
have
determined
you
to
this
*NL*
course
of
life
,
and
I
have
reason
to
fear
your
own
history
is
not
*NL*
without
misfortunes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
old
gentleman
again
sighed
,
and
remained
silent
for
some
*NL*
minutes
:
at
last
,
looking
earnestly
on
Jones
,
he
said
,
``
I
have
read
*NL*
that
a
good
countenance
is
a
letter
of
recommendation
;
if
so
,
none
*NL*
ever
can
be
more
strongly
recommended
than
yourself
.
If
I
did
not
feel
*NL*
some
yearnings
towards
you
from
another
consideration
,
I
must
be
the
*NL*
most
ungrateful
monster
upon
earth
;
and
I
am
really
concerned
it
is
no
*NL*
otherwise
in
my
power
than
by
words
to
convince
you
of
my
gratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
answered
,
``
That
it
was
in
his
*NL*
power
by
words
to
gratify
him
extremely
.
I
have
confest
a
curiosity
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
sir
;
need
I
say
how
much
obliged
I
should
be
to
you
,
if
you
*NL*
would
condescend
to
gratify
it
?
Will
you
suffer
me
therefore
to
beg
,
*NL*
unless
any
consideration
restrains
you
,
that
you
would
be
pleased
to
*NL*
acquaint
me
what
motives
have
induced
you
thus
to
withdraw
from
the
*NL*
society
of
mankind
,
and
to
betake
yourself
to
a
course
of
life
to
*NL*
which
it
sufficiently
appears
you
were
not
born
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
scarce
think
myself
at
liberty
to
refuse
you
anything
after
what
*NL*
hath
happened
,
''
replied
the
old
man
.
``
If
you
desire
therefore
to
hear
*NL*
the
story
of
an
unhappy
man
,
I
will
relate
it
to
you
.
Indeed
you
judge
*NL*
rightly
,
in
thinking
there
is
commonly
something
extraordinary
in
the
*NL*
fortunes
of
those
who
fly
from
society
;
for
however
it
may
seem
a
*NL*
paradox
,
or
even
a
contradiction
,
certain
it
is
,
that
great
*NL*
philanthropy
chiefly
inclines
us
to
avoid
and
detest
mankind
;
not
on
*NL*
account
so
much
of
their
private
and
selfish
vices
,
but
for
those
of
a
*NL*
relative
kind
;
such
as
envy
,
malice
,
treachery
,
cruelty
,
with
every
*NL*
other
species
of
malevolence
.
These
are
the
vices
which
true
*NL*
philanthropy
abhors
,
and
which
rather
than
see
and
converse
with
,
she
*NL*
avoids
society
itself
.
However
,
without
a
compliment
to
you
,
you
do
*NL*
not
appear
to
me
one
of
those
whom
I
should
shun
or
detest
;
nay
,
I
*NL*
must
say
,
in
what
little
hath
dropt
from
you
,
there
appears
some
*NL*
parity
in
our
fortunes
:
I
hope
,
however
,
yours
will
conclude
more
*NL*
successfully
.

Here
some
compliments
passed
between
our
heroe
and
his
host
,
and
then
*NL*
the
latter
was
going
to
begin
his
history
,
when
Partridge
interrupted
*NL*
him
.
His
apprehensions
had
now
pretty
well
left
him
,
but
some
effects
*NL*
of
his
terrors
remained
;
he
therefore
reminded
the
gentleman
of
that
*NL*
excellent
brandy
which
he
had
mentioned
.
This
was
presently
brought
,
*NL*
and
Partridge
swallowed
a
large
bumper
.

The
gentleman
then

In

the

of

begins
to

his
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
born
in
a
village
of
Somersetshire
,
called
Mark
,
in
the
year
*NL*
1657
.
My
father
was
one
of
those
whom
they
call
gentlemen
farmers
.
He
*NL*
had
a
little
estate
of
about
L300
a
year
of
his
own
,
and
rented
*NL*
another
estate
of
near
the
same
value
.
He
was
prudent
and
industrious
,
*NL*
and
so
good
a
husbandman
,
that
he
might
have
led
a
very
easy
and
*NL*
comfortable
life
,
had
not
an
arrant
vixen
of
a
wife
soured
his
*NL*
domestic
quiet
.
But
though
this
circumstance
perhaps
made
him
*NL*
miserable
,
it
did
not
make
him
poor
;
for
he
confined
her
almost
*NL*
entirely
at
home
,
and
rather
chose
to
bear
eternal
upbraidings
in
his
*NL*
own
house
,
than
to
injure
his
fortune
by
indulging
her
in
the
*NL*
extravagancies
she
desired
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
this
Xanthippe
''
-LRB-
so
was
the
wife
of
Socrates
called
,
said
*NL*
Partridge
-RRB-
--
``
by
this
Xanthippe
he
had
two
sons
,
of
which
I
was
the
*NL*
younger
.
He
designed
to
give
us
both
good
education
;
but
my
elder
*NL*
brother
,
who
,
unhappily
for
him
,
was
the
favourite
of
my
mother
,
*NL*
utterly
neglected
his
learning
;
insomuch
that
,
after
having
been
five
*NL*
or
six
years
at
school
with
little
or
no
improvement
,
my
father
,
being
*NL*
told
by
his
master
that
it
would
be
to
no
purpose
to
keep
him
longer
*NL*
there
,
at
last
complied
with
my
mother
in
taking
him
home
from
the
*NL*
hands
of
that
tyrant
,
as
she
called
his
master
;
though
indeed
he
gave
*NL*
the
lad
much
less
correction
than
his
idleness
deserved
,
but
much
*NL*
more
,
it
seems
,
than
the
young
gentleman
liked
,
who
constantly
*NL*
complained
to
his
mother
of
his
severe
treatment
,
and
she
as
*NL*
constantly
gave
him
a
hearing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
cries
Partridge
,
``
I
have
seen
such
mothers
;
I
have
been
*NL*
abused
myself
by
them
,
and
very
unjustly
;
such
parents
deserve
*NL*
correction
as
much
as
their
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
chid
the
pedagogue
for
his
interruption
,
and
then
the
stranger
*NL*
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
now
,
at
the
age
of
fifteen
,
bade
adieu
to
all
learning
,
*NL*
and
to
everything
else
but
to
his
dog
and
gun
;
with
which
latter
he
*NL*
became
so
expert
,
that
,
though
perhaps
you
may
think
it
incredible
,
he
*NL*
could
not
only
hit
a
standing
mark
with
great
certainty
,
but
hath
*NL*
actually
shot
a
crow
as
it
was
flying
in
the
air
.
He
was
likewise
*NL*
excellent
at
finding
a
hare
sitting
,
and
was
soon
reputed
one
of
the
*NL*
best
sportsmen
in
the
country
;
a
reputation
which
both
he
and
his
*NL*
mother
enjoyed
as
much
as
if
he
had
been
thought
the
finest
scholar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
situation
of
my
brother
made
me
at
first
think
my
lot
the
harder
,
*NL*
in
being
continued
at
school
:
but
I
soon
changed
my
opinion
;
for
as
I
*NL*
advanced
pretty
fast
in
learning
,
my
labours
became
easy
,
and
my
*NL*
exercise
so
delightful
,
that
holidays
were
my
most
unpleasant
time
;
*NL*
for
my
mother
,
who
never
loved
me
,
now
apprehending
that
I
had
the
*NL*
greater
share
of
my
father
's
affection
,
and
finding
,
or
at
least
*NL*
thinking
,
that
I
was
more
taken
notice
of
by
some
gentlemen
of
*NL*
learning
,
and
particularly
by
the
parson
of
the
parish
,
than
my
*NL*
brother
,
she
now
hated
my
sight
,
and
made
home
so
disagreeable
to
me
,
*NL*
that
what
is
called
by
school-boys
Black
Monday
,
was
to
me
the
whitest
*NL*
in
the
whole
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
at
length
gone
through
the
school
at
Taunton
,
I
was
thence
*NL*
removed
to
Exeter
College
in
Oxford
,
where
I
remained
four
years
;
at
*NL*
the
end
of
which
an
accident
took
me
off
entirely
from
my
studies
;
and
*NL*
hence
,
I
may
truly
date
the
rise
of
all
which
happened
to
me
*NL*
afterwards
in
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
at
the
same
college
with
myself
one
Sir
George
Gresham
,
a
*NL*
young
fellow
who
was
intitled
to
a
very
considerable
fortune
,
which
he
*NL*
was
not
,
by
the
will
of
his
father
,
to
come
into
full
possession
of
*NL*
till
he
arrived
at
the
age
of
twenty-five
.
However
,
the
liberality
of
*NL*
his
guardians
gave
him
little
cause
to
regret
the
abundant
caution
of
*NL*
his
father
;
for
they
allowed
him
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
while
he
*NL*
remained
at
the
university
,
where
he
kept
his
horses
and
his
whore
,
*NL*
and
lived
as
wicked
and
as
profligate
a
life
as
he
could
have
done
had
*NL*
he
been
never
so
entirely
master
of
his
fortune
;
for
besides
the
five
*NL*
hundred
a
year
which
he
received
from
his
guardians
,
he
found
means
to
*NL*
spend
a
thousand
more
.
He
was
above
the
age
of
twenty-one
,
and
had
no
*NL*
difficulty
in
gaining
what
credit
he
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
young
fellow
,
among
many
other
tolerable
bad
qualities
,
had
one
*NL*
very
diabolical
.
He
had
a
great
delight
in
destroying
and
ruining
the
*NL*
youth
of
inferior
fortune
,
by
drawing
them
into
expenses
which
they
*NL*
could
not
afford
so
well
as
himself
;
and
the
better
,
and
worthier
,
and
*NL*
soberer
any
young
man
was
,
the
greater
pleasure
and
triumph
had
he
in
*NL*
his
destruction
.
Thus
acting
the
character
which
is
recorded
of
the
*NL*
devil
,
and
going
about
seeking
whom
he
might
devour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
my
misfortune
to
fall
into
an
acquaintance
and
intimacy
with
*NL*
this
gentleman
.
My
reputation
of
diligence
in
my
studies
made
me
a
*NL*
desirable
object
of
his
mischievous
intention
;
and
my
own
inclination
*NL*
made
it
sufficiently
easy
for
him
to
effect
his
purpose
;
for
though
I
*NL*
had
applied
myself
with
much
industry
to
books
,
in
which
I
took
great
*NL*
delight
,
there
were
other
pleasures
in
which
I
was
capable
of
taking
*NL*
much
greater
;
for
I
was
high-mettled
,
had
a
violent
flow
of
animal
*NL*
spirits
,
was
a
little
ambitious
,
and
extremely
amorous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
not
long
contracted
an
intimacy
with
Sir
George
before
I
became
*NL*
a
partaker
of
all
his
pleasures
;
and
when
I
was
once
entered
on
that
*NL*
scene
,
neither
my
inclination
nor
my
spirit
would
suffer
me
to
play
an
*NL*
under
part
.
I
was
second
to
none
of
the
company
in
any
acts
of
*NL*
debauchery
;
nay
,
I
soon
distinguished
myself
so
notably
in
all
riots
*NL*
and
disorders
,
that
my
name
generally
stood
first
in
the
roll
of
*NL*
delinquents
;
and
instead
of
being
lamented
as
the
unfortunate
pupil
of
*NL*
Sir
George
,
I
was
now
accused
as
the
person
who
had
misled
and
*NL*
debauched
that
hopeful
young
gentleman
;
for
though
he
was
the
*NL*
ringleader
and
promoter
of
all
the
mischief
,
he
was
never
so
*NL*
considered
.
I
fell
at
last
under
the
censure
of
the
vice-chancellor
,
*NL*
and
very
narrowly
escaped
expulsion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
easily
believe
,
sir
,
that
such
a
life
as
I
am
now
describing
*NL*
must
be
incompatible
with
my
further
progress
in
learning
;
and
that
in
*NL*
proportion
as
I
addicted
myself
more
and
more
to
loose
pleasure
,
I
*NL*
must
grow
more
and
more
remiss
in
application
to
my
studies
.
This
was
*NL*
truly
the
consequence
;
but
this
was
not
all
.
My
expenses
now
greatly
*NL*
exceeded
not
only
my
former
income
,
but
those
additions
which
I
*NL*
extorted
from
my
poor
generous
father
,
on
pretences
of
sums
being
*NL*
necessary
for
preparing
for
my
approaching
degree
of
batchelor
of
*NL*
arts
.
These
demands
,
however
,
grew
at
last
so
frequent
and
exorbitant
,
*NL*
that
my
father
by
slow
degrees
opened
his
ears
to
the
accounts
which
*NL*
he
received
from
many
quarters
of
my
present
behaviour
,
and
which
my
*NL*
mother
failed
not
to
echo
very
faithfully
and
loudly
;
adding
,
`
Ay
,
*NL*
this
is
the
fine
gentleman
,
the
scholar
who
doth
so
much
honour
to
his
*NL*
family
,
and
is
to
be
the
making
of
it
.
I
thought
what
all
this
*NL*
learning
would
come
to
.
He
is
to
be
the
ruin
of
us
all
,
I
find
,
after
*NL*
his
elder
brother
hath
been
denied
necessaries
for
his
sake
,
to
*NL*
perfect
his
education
forsooth
,
for
which
he
was
to
pay
us
such
*NL*
interest
:
I
thought
what
the
interest
would
come
to
,
'
with
much
more
*NL*
of
the
same
kind
;
but
I
have
,
I
believe
,
satisfied
you
with
this
*NL*
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
,
therefore
,
began
now
to
return
remonstrances
instead
of
*NL*
money
to
my
demands
,
which
brought
my
affairs
perhaps
a
little
sooner
*NL*
to
a
crisis
;
but
had
he
remitted
me
his
whole
income
,
you
will
imagine
*NL*
it
could
have
sufficed
a
very
short
time
to
support
one
who
kept
pace
*NL*
with
the
expenses
of
Sir
George
Gresham
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
more
than
possible
that
the
distress
I
was
now
in
for
money
,
*NL*
and
the
impracticability
of
going
on
in
this
manner
,
might
have
*NL*
restored
me
at
once
to
my
senses
and
to
my
studies
,
had
I
opened
my
*NL*
eyes
before
I
became
involved
in
debts
from
which
I
saw
no
hopes
of
*NL*
ever
extricating
myself
.
This
was
indeed
the
great
art
of
Sir
George
,
*NL*
and
by
which
he
accomplished
the
ruin
of
many
,
whom
he
afterwards
*NL*
laughed
at
as
fools
and
coxcombs
,
for
vying
,
as
he
called
it
,
with
a
*NL*
man
of
his
fortune
.
To
bring
this
about
,
he
would
now
and
then
advance
*NL*
a
little
money
himself
,
in
order
to
support
the
credit
of
the
*NL*
unfortunate
youth
with
other
people
;
till
,
by
means
of
that
very
*NL*
credit
,
he
was
irretrievably
undone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mind
being
by
these
means
grown
as
desperate
as
my
fortune
,
there
*NL*
was
scarce
a
wickedness
which
I
did
not
meditate
,
in
order
for
my
*NL*
relief
.
Self-murder
itself
became
the
subject
of
my
serious
*NL*
deliberation
;
and
I
had
certainly
resolved
on
it
,
had
not
a
more
*NL*
shameful
,
though
perhaps
less
sinful
,
thought
expelled
it
from
my
*NL*
head
.
''
--
Here
he
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
cried
out
,
``
I
protest
,
so
*NL*
many
years
have
not
washed
away
the
shame
of
this
act
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
blush
while
I
relate
it
.
''
Jones
desired
him
to
pass
over
anything
that
*NL*
might
give
him
pain
in
the
relation
;
but
Partridge
eagerly
cried
out
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
pray
,
sir
,
let
us
hear
this
;
I
had
rather
hear
this
than
all
the
*NL*
rest
;
as
I
hope
to
be
saved
,
I
will
never
mention
a
word
of
it
.
''
Jones
*NL*
was
going
to
rebuke
him
,
but
the
stranger
prevented
it
by
proceeding
*NL*
thus
:
``
I
had
a
chum
,
a
very
prudent
,
frugal
young
lad
,
who
,
though
he
*NL*
had
no
very
large
allowance
,
had
by
his
parsimony
heaped
up
upwards
of
*NL*
forty
guineas
,
which
I
knew
he
kept
in
his
escritore
.
I
took
therefore
*NL*
an
opportunity
of
purloining
his
key
from
his
breeches-pocket
,
while
*NL*
he
was
asleep
,
and
thus
made
myself
master
of
all
his
riches
:
after
*NL*
which
I
again
conveyed
his
key
into
his
pocket
,
and
counterfeiting
*NL*
sleep
--
though
I
never
once
closed
my
eyes
,
lay
in
bed
till
after
he
*NL*
arose
and
went
to
prayers
--
an
exercise
to
which
I
had
long
been
*NL*
unaccustomed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Timorous
thieves
,
by
extreme
caution
,
often
subject
themselves
to
*NL*
discoveries
,
which
those
of
a
bolder
kind
escape
.
Thus
it
happened
to
*NL*
me
;
for
had
I
boldly
broke
open
his
escritore
,
I
had
,
perhaps
,
escaped
*NL*
even
his
suspicion
;
but
as
it
was
plain
that
the
person
who
robbed
him
*NL*
had
possessed
himself
of
his
key
,
he
had
no
doubt
,
when
he
first
*NL*
missed
his
money
,
but
that
his
chum
was
certainly
the
thief
.
Now
as
he
*NL*
was
of
a
fearful
disposition
,
and
much
my
inferior
in
strength
,
and
I
*NL*
believe
in
courage
,
he
did
not
dare
to
confront
me
with
my
guilt
,
for
*NL*
fear
of
worse
bodily
consequences
which
might
happen
to
him
.
He
*NL*
repaired
therefore
immediately
to
the
vice-chancellor
,
and
upon
*NL*
swearing
to
the
robbery
,
and
to
the
circumstances
of
it
,
very
easily
*NL*
obtained
a
warrant
against
one
who
had
now
so
bad
a
character
through
*NL*
the
whole
university
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luckily
for
me
,
I
lay
out
of
the
college
the
next
evening
;
for
that
*NL*
day
I
attended
a
young
lady
in
a
chaise
to
Witney
,
where
we
staid
all
*NL*
night
,
and
in
our
return
,
the
next
morning
,
to
Oxford
,
I
met
one
of
my
*NL*
cronies

who
acquainted
me
with
sufficient
news
concerning
myself

make
me
turn
my
horse
another
way

``
Pray

Partridge
.
*NL*
But
Jones
begged
the
gentleman
to
proceed
without
regarding
any
*NL*
impertinent
questions
;
which
he
did
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
now
abandoned
all
thoughts
of
returning
to
Oxford
,
the
next
*NL*
thing
which
offered
itself
was
a
journey
to
London
.
I
imparted
this
*NL*
intention
to
my
female
companion
,
who
at
first
remonstrated
against
*NL*
it
;
but
upon
producing
my
wealth
,
she
immediately
consented
.
We
then
*NL*
struck
across
the
country
,
into
the
great
Cirencester
road
,
and
made
*NL*
such
haste
,
that
we
spent
the
next
evening
,
save
one
,
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
consider
the
place
where
I
now
was
,
and
the
company
with
*NL*
whom
I
was
,
you
will
,
I
fancy
,
conceive
that
a
very
short
time
brought
*NL*
me
to
an
end
of
that
sum
of
which
I
had
so
iniquitously
possessed
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
now
reduced
to
a
much
higher
degree
of
distress
than
before
:
*NL*
the
necessaries
of
life
began
to
be
numbered
among
my
wants
;
and
what
*NL*
made
my
case
still
the
more
grievous
was
,
that
my
paramour
,
of
whom
I
*NL*
was
now
grown
immoderately
fond
,
shared
the
same
distresses
with
*NL*
myself
.
To
see
a
woman
you
love
in
distress
;
to
be
unable
to
relieve
*NL*
her
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
reflect
that
you
have
brought
her
into
*NL*
this
situation
,
is
perhaps
a
curse
of
which
no
imagination
can
*NL*
represent
the
horrors
to
those
who
have
not
felt
it
.
''
--
``
I
believe
it
*NL*
from
my
soul
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
and
I
pity
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
*NL*
heart
:
''
he
then
took
two
or
three
disorderly
turns
about
the
room
,
and
*NL*
at
last
begged
pardon
,
and
flung
himself
into
his
chair
,
crying
,
``
I
*NL*
thank
Heaven
,
I
have
escaped
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
circumstance
,
''
continued
the
gentleman
,
``
so
severely
aggravated
*NL*
the
horrors
of
my
present
situation
,
that
they
became
absolutely
*NL*
intolerable
.
I
could
with
less
pain
endure
the
raging
in
my
own
*NL*
natural
unsatisfied
appetites
,
even
hunger
or
thirst
,
than
I
could
*NL*
submit
to
leave
ungratified
the
most
whimsical
desires
of
a
woman
on
*NL*
whom
I
so
extravagantly
doated
,
that
,
though
I
knew
she
had
been
the
*NL*
mistress
of
half
my
acquaintance
,
I
firmly
intended
to
marry
her
.
But
*NL*
the
good
creature
was
unwilling
to
consent
to
an
action
which
the
*NL*
world
might
think
so
much
to
my
disadvantage
.
And
as
,
possibly
,
she
*NL*
compassionated
the
daily
anxieties
which
she
must
have
perceived
me
*NL*
suffer
on
her
account
,
she
resolved
to
put
an
end
to
my
distress
.
She
*NL*
soon
,
indeed
,
found
means
to
relieve
me
from
my
troublesome
and
*NL*
perplexed
situation
;
for
while
I
was
distracted
with
various
*NL*
inventions
to
supply
her
with
pleasures
,
she
very
kindly
--
betrayed
me
*NL*
to
one
of
her
former
lovers
at
Oxford
,
by
whose
care
and
diligence
I
*NL*
was
immediately
apprehended
and
committed
to
gaol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
first
began
seriously
to
reflect
on
the
miscarriages
of
my
*NL*
former
life
;
on
the
errors
I
had
been
guilty
of
;
on
the
misfortunes
*NL*
which
I
had
brought
on
myself
;
and
on
the
grief
which
I
must
have
*NL*
occasioned
to
one
of
the
best
of
fathers
.
When
I
added
to
all
these
*NL*
the
perfidy
of
my
mistress
,
such
was
the
horror
of
my
mind
,
that
life
,
*NL*
instead
of
being
longer
desirable
,
grew
the
object
of
my
abhorrence
;
*NL*
and
I
could
have
gladly
embraced
death
as
my
dearest
friend
,
if
it
had
*NL*
offered
itself
to
my
choice
unattended
by
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
time
of
the
assizes
soon
came
,
and
I
was
removed
by
habeas
corpus
*NL*
to
Oxford
,
where
I
expected
certain
conviction
and
condemnation
;
but
,
*NL*
to
my
great
surprize
,
none
appeared
against
me
,
and
I
was
,
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
sessions
,
discharged
for
want
of
prosecution
.
In
short
,
my
chum
*NL*
had
left
Oxford
,
and
whether
from
indolence
,
or
from
what
other
motive
*NL*
I
am
ignorant
,
had
declined
concerning
himself
any
farther
in
the
*NL*
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
cries
Partridge
,
``
he
did
not
care
to
have
your
blood
upon
*NL*
his
hands
;
and
he
was
in
the
right
o
n't
.
If
any
person
was
to
be
*NL*
hanged
upon
my
evidence
,
I
should
never
be
able
to
lie
alone
*NL*
afterwards
,
for
fear
of
seeing
his
ghost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
shortly
doubt
,
Partridge
,
''
says
Jones
,
``
whether
thou
art
more
*NL*
brave
or
wise
.
''
--
``
You
may
laugh
at
me
,
sir
,
if
you
please
,
''
answered
*NL*
Partridge
;
``
but
if
you
will
hear
a
very
short
story
which
I
can
tell
,
*NL*
and
which
is
most
certainly
true
,
perhaps
you
may
change
your
opinion
.
*NL*
In
the
parish
where
I
was
born
--
''
Here
Jones
would
have
silenced
him
;
*NL*
but
the
stranger
interceded
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
tell
his
*NL*
story
,
and
in
the
meantime
promised
to
recollect
the
remainder
of
his
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
then
proceeded
thus
:
``
In
the
parish
where
I
was
born
,
there
*NL*
lived
a
farmer
whose
name
was
Bridle
,
and
he
had
a
son
named
Francis
,
*NL*
a
good
hopeful
young
fellow
:
I
was
at
the
grammar-school
with
him
,
*NL*
where
I
remember
he
was
got
into
Ovid
's
Epistles
,
and
he
could
*NL*
construe
you
three
lines
together
sometimes
without
looking
into
a
*NL*
dictionary
.
Besides
all
this
,
he
was
a
very
good
lad
,
never
missed
*NL*
church
o
'
Sundays
,
and
was
reckoned
one
of
the
best
psalm-singers
in
*NL*
the
whole
parish
.
He
would
indeed
now
and
then
take
a
cup
too
much
,
*NL*
and
that
was
the
only
fault
he
had
.
''
--
``
Well
,
but
come
to
the
ghost
,
''
*NL*
cries
Jones
.
``
Never
fear
,
sir
;
I
shall
come
to
him
soon
enough
,
''
*NL*
answered
Partridge
.
``
You
must
know
,
then
,
that
farmer
Bridle
lost
a
*NL*
mare
,
a
sorrel
one
,
to
the
best
of
my
remembrance
;
and
so
it
fell
out
*NL*
that
this
young
Francis
shortly
afterward
being
at
a
fair
at
Hindon
,
*NL*
and
as
I
think
it
was
on
--
,
I
ca
n't
remember
the
day
;
and
being
as
he
*NL*
was
,
what
should
he
happen
to
meet
but
a
man
upon
his
father
's
mare
.
*NL*
Frank
called
out
presently
,
Stop
thief
;
and
it
being
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
fair
,
it
was
impossible
,
you
know
,
for
the
man
to
make
his
escape
.
*NL*
So
they
apprehended
him
and
carried
him
before
the
justice
:
I
remember
*NL*
it
was
Justice
Willoughby
,
of
Noyle
,
a
very
worthy
good
gentleman
;
and
*NL*
he
committed
him
to
prison
,
and
bound
Frank
in
a
recognisance
,
I
think
*NL*
they
call
it
--
a
hard
word
compounded
of
_
re
_
and
_
cognosco
_
;
but
it
*NL*
differs
in
its
meaning
from
the
use
of
the
simple
,
as
many
other
*NL*
compounds
do
.
Well
,
at
last
down
came
my
Lord
Justice
Page
to
hold
the
*NL*
assizes
;
and
so
the
fellow
was
had
up
,
and
Frank
was
had
up
for
a
*NL*
witness
.
To
be
sure
,
I
shall
never
forget
the
face
of
the
judge
,
when
*NL*
he
began
to
ask
him
what
he
had
to
say
against
the
prisoner
.
He
made
*NL*
poor
Frank
tremble
and
shake
in
his
shoes
.
`
Well
you
,
fellow
,
'
says
my
*NL*
lord
,
`
what
have
you
to
say
?
Do
n't
stand
humming
and
hawing
,
but
speak
*NL*
out
.
'
But
,
however
,
he
soon
turned
altogether
as
civil
to
Frank
,
and
*NL*
began
to
thunder
at
the
fellow
;
and
when
he
asked
him
if
he
had
*NL*
anything
to
say
for
himself
,
the
fellow
said
,
he
had
found
the
horse
.
*NL*
`
Ay
!
'
answered
the
judge
,
`
thou
art
a
lucky
fellow
:
I
have
travelled
*NL*
the
circuit
these
forty
years
,
and
never
found
a
horse
in
my
life
:
but
*NL*
I
'll
tell
thee
what
,
friend
,
thou
wast
more
lucky
than
thou
didst
know
*NL*
of
;
for
thou
didst
not
only
find
a
horse
,
but
a
halter
too
,
I
promise
*NL*
thee
.
'
To
be
sure
,
I
shall
never
forget
the
word
.
Upon
which
everybody
*NL*
fell
a
laughing
,
as
how
could
they
help
it
?
Nay
,
and
twenty
other
*NL*
jests
he
made
,
which
I
ca
n't
remember
now
.
There
was
something
about
*NL*
his
skill
in
horse-flesh
which
made
all
the
folks
laugh
.
To
be
*NL*
certain
,
the
judge
must
have
been
a
very
brave
man
,
as
well
as
a
man
*NL*
of
much
learning
.
It
is
indeed
charming
sport
to
hear
trials
upon
life
*NL*
and
death
.
One
thing
I
own
I
thought
a
little
hard
,
that
the
*NL*
prisoner
's
counsel
was
not
suffered
to
speak
for
him
,
though
he
*NL*
desired
only
to
be
heard
one
very
short
word
,
but
my
lord
would
not
*NL*
hearken
to
him
,
though
he
suffered
a
counsellor
to
talk
against
him
*NL*
for
above
half-an-hour
.
I
thought
it
hard
,
I
own
,
that
there
should
be
*NL*
so
many
of
them
;
my
lord
,
and
the
court
,
and
the
jury
,
and
the
*NL*
counsellors
,
and
the
witnesses
,
all
upon
one
poor
man
,
and
he
too
in
*NL*
chains
.
Well
,
the
fellow
was
hanged
,
as
to
be
sure
it
could
be
no
*NL*
otherwise
,
and
poor
Frank
could
never
be
easy
about
it
.
He
never
was
*NL*
in
the
dark
alone
,
but
he
fancied
he
saw
the
fellow
's
spirit
.
''
--
``
Well
,
*NL*
and
is
this
thy
story
?
''
cries
Jones
.
``
No
,
no
,
''
answered
Partridge
.
``
O
*NL*
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
I
am
just
now
coming
to
the
matter
;
for
one
*NL*
night
,
coming
from
the
alehouse
,
in
a
long
,
narrow
,
dark
lane
,
there
*NL*
he
ran
directly
up
against
him
;
and
the
spirit
was
all
in
white
,
and
*NL*
fell
upon
Frank
;
and
Frank
,
who
was
a
sturdy
lad
,
fell
upon
the
spirit
*NL*
again
,
and
there
they
had
a
tussel
together
,
and
poor
Frank
was
*NL*
dreadfully
beat
:
indeed
he
made
a
shift
at
last
to
crawl
home
;
but
*NL*
what
with
the
beating
,
and
what
with
the
fright
,
he
lay
ill
above
a
*NL*
fortnight
;
and
all
this
is
most
certainly
true
,
and
the
whole
parish
*NL*
will
bear
witness
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
smiled
at
this
story
,
and
Jones
burst
into
a
loud
fit
of
*NL*
laughter
;
upon
which
Partridge
cried
,
``
Ay
,
you
may
laugh
,
sir
;
and
so
*NL*
did
some
others
,
particularly
a
squire
,
who
is
thought
to
be
no
better
*NL*
than
an
atheist
;
who
,
forsooth
,
because
there
was
a
calf
with
a
white
*NL*
face
found
dead
in
the
same
lane
the
next
morning
,
would
fain
have
it
*NL*
that
the
battle
was
between
Frank
and
that
,
as
if
a
calf
would
set
*NL*
upon
a
man
.
Besides
,
Frank
told
me
he
knew
it
to
be
a
spirit
,
and
*NL*
could
swear
to
him
in
any
court
in
Christendom
;
and
he
had
not
drank
*NL*
above
a
quart
or
two
or
such
a
matter
of
liquor
,
at
the
time
.
Lud
have
*NL*
mercy
upon
us
,
and
keep
us
all
from
dipping
our
hands
in
blood
,
I
*NL*
say
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
Jones
to
the
stranger
,
``
Mr
Partridge
hath
finished
*NL*
his
story
,
and
I
hope
will
give
you
no
future
interruption
,
if
you
*NL*
will
be
so
kind
to
proceed
.
''
He
then
resumed
his
narration
;
but
as
he
*NL*
hath
taken
breath
for
a
while
,
we
think
proper
to
give
it
to
our
*NL*
reader
,
and
shall
therefore
put
an
end
to
this
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
xii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
the
Man
of
the
Hill
continues
his
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
now
regained
my
liberty
,
''
said
the
stranger
;
``
but
I
had
lost
my
*NL*
reputation
;
for
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
the
case
of
a
man
*NL*
who
is
barely
acquitted
of
a
crime
in
a
court
of
justice
,
and
of
him
*NL*
who
is
acquitted
in
his
own
heart
,
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
people
.
I
*NL*
was
conscious
of
my
guilt
,
and
ashamed
to
look
any
one
in
the
face
;
so
*NL*
resolved
to
leave
Oxford
the
next
morning
,
before
the
daylight
*NL*
discovered
me
to
the
eyes
of
any
beholders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
had
got
clear
of
the
city
,
it
first
entered
into
my
head
to
*NL*
return
home
to
my
father
,
and
endeavour
to
obtain
his
forgiveness
;
but
*NL*
as
I
had
no
reason
to
doubt
his
knowledge
of
all
which
had
past
,
and
*NL*
as
I
was
well
assured
of
his
great
aversion
to
all
acts
of
dishonesty
,
*NL*
I
could
entertain
no
hopes
of
being
received
by
him
,
especially
since
*NL*
I
was
too
certain
of
all
the
good
offices
in
the
power
of
my
mother
;
*NL*
nay
,
had
my
father
's
pardon
been
as
sure
,
as
I
conceived
his
*NL*
resentment
to
be
,
I
yet
question
whether
I
could
have
had
the
*NL*
assurance
to
behold
him
,
or
whether
I
could
,
upon
any
terms
,
have
*NL*
submitted
to
live
and
converse
with
those
who
,
I
was
convinced
,
knew
*NL*
me
to
have
been
guilty
of
so
base
an
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hastened
therefore
back
to
London
,
the
best
retirement
of
either

Well

continued
the
stranger

``
whether
it
be
an
*NL*
evil
,
or
only
the
cause
of
evil
,
I
was
entirely
void
of
it
,
and
at
the
*NL*
same
time
of
friends
,
and
,
as
I
thought
,
of
acquaintance
;
when
one
*NL*
evening
,
as
I
was
passing
through
the
Inner
Temple
,
very
hungry
,
and
*NL*
very
miserable
,
I
heard
a
voice
on
a
sudden
hailing
me
with
great
*NL*
familiarity
by
my
Christian
name
;
and
upon
turning
about
,
I
presently
*NL*
recollected
the
person
who
so
saluted
me
to
have
been
my
*NL*
fellow-collegiate
;
one
who
had
left
the
university
above
a
year
,
and
*NL*
long
before
any
of
my
misfortunes
had
befallen
me
.
This
gentleman
,
*NL*
whose
name
was
Watson
,
shook
me
heartily
by
the
hand
;
and
expressing
*NL*
great
joy
at
meeting
me
,
proposed
our
immediately
drinking
a
bottle
*NL*
together
.
I
first
declined
the
proposal
,
and
pretended
business
,
but
*NL*
as
he
was
very
earnest
and
pressing
,
hunger
at
last
overcame
my
pride
,
*NL*
and
I
fairly
confessed
to
him
I
had
no
money
in
my
pocket
;
yet
not
*NL*
without
framing
a
lie
for
an
excuse
,
and
imputing
it
to
my
having
*NL*
changed
my
breeches
that
morning
.
Mr
Watson
answered
,
`
I
thought
,
*NL*
Jack
,
you
and
I
had
been
too
old
acquaintance
for
you
to
mention
such
*NL*
a
matter
.
'
He
then
took
me
by
the
arm
,
and
was
pulling
me
along
;
but
I
*NL*
gave
him
very
little
trouble
,
for
my
own
inclinations
pulled
me
much
*NL*
stronger
than
he
could
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
then
went
into
the
Friars
,
which
you
know
is
the
scene
of
all
*NL*
mirth
and
jollity
.
Here
,
when
we
arrived
at
the
tavern
,
Mr
Watson
*NL*
applied
himself
to
the
drawer
only
,
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
*NL*
the
cook
;
for
he
had
no
suspicion
but
that
I
had
dined
long
since
.
*NL*
However
,
as
the
case
was
really
otherwise
,
I
forged
another
falsehood
,
*NL*
and
told
my
companion
I
had
been
at
the
further
end
of
the
city
on
*NL*
business
of
consequence
,
and
had
snapt
up
a
mutton-chop
in
haste
;
so
*NL*
that
I
was
again
hungry
,
and
wished
he
would
add
a
beef-steak
to
his
*NL*
bottle
.

--
``
Some
people

cries
Partridge
,
``
ought
to
have
good
*NL*
memories

or
did
you
find
just
money
enough
in
your
breeches
to
pay

for
the
mutton-chop
?
''
--
``
Your
observation
is
right

answered
the
*NL*
stranger
,
``

I
believe
such
blunders
are
inseparable
from
all

But
to
proceed
--
I
began
now
to
feel
myself
*NL*
extremely
happy
.
The
meat
and
wine
soon
revived
my
spirits
to
a
high
*NL*
pitch
,
and
I
enjoyed
much
pleasure
in
the
conversation
of
my
old
*NL*
acquaintance
,
the
rather
as
I
thought
him
entirely
ignorant
of
what
*NL*
had
happened
at
the
university
since
his
leaving
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

he
did
not
suffer
me
to
remain
long
in
this
agreeable
delusion

for
taking
a
bumper
in
one
hand
,
and
holding
me
by
the
other

wishing
you
joy

your
being
so
honourably

acquitted
of
that
affair
laid
to
your
charge

I
was
thunderstruck
*NL*
with
confusion
at
those
words
,
which
Watson
observing
,
proceeded
thus
:
*NL*
`
Nay
,
never
be
ashamed

man
;
thou
hast
been
acquitted
,
and
no
one
now
*NL*
dares
call
thee
guilty
;
but
,
prithee
,
do
tell
me
,
who
am
thy
friend

I
*NL*
hope
thou
didst
really
rob
him
?
for
rat
me
if
it
was
not
a
meritorious
*NL*
action
to
strip
such
a
sneaking

pitiful
rascal
;
and
instead
of
the
*NL*
two
hundred
guineas
,
I
wish
you
had
taken
as
many
thousand

Come
,
*NL*
come
,
my
boy
,
do
n't
be
shy
of
confessing
to
me
:

not

you

``
This
declaration
a
little
relieved
my
abashment

as
wine
had
now
*NL*
somewhat
opened
my
heart
,
I
very
freely
acknowledged
the
robbery
,

*NL*
acquainted
him
that
he
had
been
misinformed

taken

I
will
show

out

I
had
informed
him
of
the
emptiness

To
say
the
truth

I
doubted
not
from
his
many
strong
*NL*
expressions
of
friendship
,
but
that
he
would
offer
to
lend
me
a
small

Jones
stopped
his

circumspect

tip
you

may
be
necessary

as
you

do
not

one

*NL*
``
The
bill
was
now
brought
,
when
Watson
paid
his

was

departing

I
reminded
him

not
without
blushing

of
my
having
no

money

He
answered
,
`
That

nothing

score
it
behind

make
a
bold
brush

take

he
;

I
will
*NL*
go
down-stairs
first

then
do
you
take
up
my
money
,
and
score
the
*NL*
whole
reckoning
at
the
bar
,
and
I
will
wait
for
you
at
the
corner

'
I
*NL*
expressed
some
dislike
at
this
,
and
hinted
my
expectations
that
he
*NL*
would
have
deposited
the
whole
;
but
he
swore
he
had
not
another
*NL*
sixpence
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
then
went
down
,
and
I
was
prevailed
on
to
take
up
the
money
and
*NL*
follow
him
,
which
I
did
close
enough
to
hear
him
tell
the
drawer
the
*NL*
reckoning
was
upon
the
table

The

past
by
me
up-stairs

I

made
such
haste
into

I
heard
nothing

his

disappointment

did
I
mention
a
syllable
at
the

according
to

my
instructions

``
We
now
went
directly
to
the
gaming-table
,
where
Mr
Watson
,
to
my
*NL*
surprize
,
pulled
out
a
large
sum
of
money
and
placed
it
before
him
,
as
*NL*
did
many
others
;
all
of
them
,
no
doubt
,
considering
their
own
heaps
as
*NL*
so
many
decoy
birds

were
to
intice

draw
over
the
heaps
of

their
neighbours

``
Here
it
would
be
tedious
to
relate
all
the
freaks
which
Fortune
,
or
*NL*
rather
the
dice
,
played
in
this
her
temple
.
Mountains
of
gold
were
in
*NL*
a
few
moments
reduced
to
nothing
at
one
part
of
the
table
,
and
rose
as
*NL*
suddenly
in
another
.
The
rich
grew
in
a
moment
poor
,
and
the
poor
as
*NL*
suddenly
became
rich
;
so
that
it
seemed
a
philosopher
could
nowhere
*NL*
have
so
well
instructed
his
pupils
in
the
contempt
of
riches

at

*NL*
he
could

better
inculcated

incertainty

duration

For
my
own
part
,
after
having
considerably
improved
my
small
estate

I
at
last
entirely
demolished
it

Mr
Watson
too
,
after
much
variety
of
*NL*
luck
,
rose
from
the
table
in
some
heat
,
and
declared
he
had
lost
a
*NL*
cool
hundred
,
and
would
play
no
longer
.
Then
coming
up
to
me
,
he
asked
*NL*
me
to
return
with
him
to
the
tavern
;
but
I
positively
refused
,
saying
,
*NL*
I
would
not
bring
myself
a
second
time
into
such
a
dilemma
,
and
*NL*
especially
as
he
had
lost
all
his
money
and
was
now
in
my
own
*NL*
condition
.
`
Pooh
!
'
says
he
,
`
I
have
just
borrowed
a
couple
of
guineas
*NL*
of
a
friend
,
and
one
of
them
is
at
your
service
.
'
He
immediately
put
*NL*
one
of
them
into
my
hand
,
and
I
no
longer
resisted
his
inclination
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
at
first
a
little
shocked
at
returning
to

house

we
had
departed
in
so
unhandsome
a
manner
;
but
when
the
drawer
,
with
*NL*
very
civil
address

told
us
,
`
he
believed
we
had
forgot
to
pay
our
*NL*
reckoning

I
became
perfectly
easy
,
and
very
readily
gave
him
a
*NL*
guinea
,
bid
him
pay
himself
,
and
acquiesced
in
the
unjust
charge
which
*NL*
had
been
laid
on
my
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Watson
now
bespoke
the
most
extravagant
supper
he
could
well
think
*NL*
of
;
and
though
he
had
contented
himself
with
simple
claret
before
,
*NL*
nothing
now
but
the
most
precious
Burgundy
would
serve
his
purpose

*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
company
was
soon
encreased
by
the
addition
of
several
gentlemen
*NL*
from
the
gaming-table
;
most
of
whom
,
as
I
afterwards
found
,
came
not
*NL*
to
the
tavern
to
drink
,
but
in
the
way
of
business
;
for
the
true
*NL*
gamesters
pretended
to
be
ill
,
and
refused
their
glass
,
while
they
*NL*
plied
heartily
two
young
fellows
,
who
were
to
be
afterwards
pillaged
,
*NL*
as
indeed
they
were
without
mercy

Of
this
plunder
I
had
the
good
*NL*
fortune
to
be
a
sharer
,
though
I
was
not
yet
let
into
the
secret

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
one
remarkable
accident
attended
this
tavern
play

for
the
*NL*
money
by
degrees
totally
disappeared
;
so
that
though
at
the
beginning
*NL*
the
table
was
half
covered
with
gold
,
yet
before
the
play
ended

which
*NL*
it
did
not
till
the
next
day

being
Sunday

at
noon

there
was
scarce

a
single
guinea
to
be
seen
on
the
table

this
was
the
stranger
as

every
person
present
,
except
myself

declared
he
had
lost
;
and
what
*NL*
was
become
of
the
money
,
unless
the
devil
himself
carried
it
away
,
is
*NL*
difficult
to
determine

``
Most
certainly
he
did

``
My
fellow-collegiate
had
now
entered
me
in
a
new
scene
of
life
.
I
*NL*
soon
became
acquainted
with
the
whole
fraternity
of
sharpers
,
and
was
*NL*
let
into
their
secrets
;
I
mean
,
into
the
knowledge
of
those
gross
*NL*
cheats
which
are
proper
to
impose
upon
the
raw
and
unexperienced
;
for
*NL*
there
are
some
tricks
of
a
finer
kind
,
which
are
known
only
to
a
few
*NL*
of
the
gang
,
who
are
at
the
head
of
their
profession
;
a
degree
of
*NL*
honour
beyond
my
expectation
;
for
drink
,
to
which
I
was
immoderately
*NL*
addicted
,
and
the
natural
warmth
of
my
passions
,
prevented
me
from
*NL*
arriving
at
any
great
success
in
an
art
which
requires
as
much
*NL*
coolness
as
the
most
austere
school
of
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Watson
,
with
whom
I
now
lived
in
the
closest
amity
,
had
unluckily
*NL*
the
former
failing
to
a
very
great
excess
;
so
that
instead
of
making
a
*NL*
fortune
by
his
profession
,
as
some
others
did
,
he
was
alternately
rich
*NL*
and
poor
,
and
was
often
obliged
to
surrender
to
his
cooler
friends
,
*NL*
over
a
bottle
which
they
never
tasted
,
that
plunder
that
he
had
taken
*NL*
from
culls
at
the
public
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
we
both
made
a
shift
to
pick
up
an
uncomfortable
livelihood
;
*NL*
and
for
two
years
I
continued
of
the
calling
;
during
which
time
I
*NL*
tasted
all
the
varieties
of
fortune
,
sometimes
flourishing
in
*NL*
affluence
,
and
at
others
being
obliged
to
struggle
with
almost
*NL*
incredible
difficulties
.
To-day
wallowing
in
luxury
,
and
to-morrow
*NL*
reduced
to
the
coarsest
and
most
homely
fare
.
My
fine
clothes
being
*NL*
often
on
my
back
in
the
evening
,
and
at
the
pawn-shop
the
next
*NL*
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
night
,
as
I
was
returning
pennyless
from
the
gaming-table
,
I
*NL*
observed
a
very
great
disturbance
,
and
a
large
mob
gathered
together
*NL*
in
the
street
.
As
I
was
in
no
danger
from
pickpockets
,
I
ventured
into
*NL*
the
croud
,
where
upon
enquiry
I
found
that
a
man
had
been
robbed
and
*NL*
very
ill
used
by
some
ruffians
.
The
wounded
man
appeared
very
bloody
,
*NL*
and
seemed
scarce
able
to
support
himself
on
his
legs
.
As
I
had
not
*NL*
therefore
been
deprived
of
my
humanity
by
my
present
life
and
*NL*
conversation
,
though
they
had
left
me
very
little
of
either
honesty
or
*NL*
shame
,
I
immediately
offered
my
assistance
to
the
unhappy
person
,
who
*NL*
thankfully
accepted
it
,
and
,
putting
himself
under
my
conduct
,
begged
*NL*
me
to
convey
him
to
some
tavern
,
where
he
might
send
for
a
surgeon
,
*NL*
being
,
as
he
said
,
faint
with
loss
of
blood
.
He
seemed
indeed
highly
*NL*
pleased
at
finding
one
who
appeared
in
the
dress
of
a
gentleman
;
for
*NL*
as
to
all
the
rest
of
the
company
present
,
their
outside
was
such
that
*NL*
he
could
not
wisely
place
any
confidence
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
the
poor
man
by
the
arm
,
and
led
him
to
the
tavern
where
we
*NL*
kept
our
rendezvous
,
as
it
happened
to
be
the
nearest
at
hand
.
A
*NL*
surgeon
happening
luckily
to
be
in
the
house
,
immediately
attended
,
*NL*
and
applied
himself
to
dressing
his
wounds
,
which
I
had
the
pleasure
*NL*
to
hear
were
not
likely
to
be
mortal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
surgeon
having
very
expeditiously
and
dextrously
finished
his
*NL*
business
,
began
to
enquire
in
what
part
of
the
town
the
wounded
man
*NL*
lodged
;
who
answered
,
`
That
he
was
come
to
town
that
very
morning
;
*NL*
that
his
horse
was
at
an
inn
in
Piccadilly
,
and
that
he
had
no
other
*NL*
lodging
,
and
very
little
or
no
acquaintance
in
town
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
surgeon
,
whose
name
I
have
forgot
,
though
I
remember
it
began
*NL*
with
an
R
,
had
the
first
character
in
his
profession
,
and
was
*NL*
serjeant-surgeon
to
the
king
.
He
had
moreover
many
good
qualities
,
and
*NL*
was
a
very
generous
good-natured
man
,
and
ready
to
do
any
service
to
*NL*
his
fellow-creatures
.
He
offered
his
patient
the
use
of
his
chariot
to
*NL*
carry
him
to
his
inn
,
and
at
the
same
time
whispered
in
his
ear
,
`
That
*NL*
if
he
wanted
any
money
,
he
would
furnish
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
poor
man
was
not
now
capable
of
returning
thanks
for
this
*NL*
generous
offer
;
for
having
had
his
eyes
for
some
time
stedfastly
on
*NL*
me
,
he
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
crying
,
`
Oh
,
my
son
!
my
son
!
'
*NL*
and
then
fainted
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Many
of
the
people
present
imagined
this
accident
had
happened
*NL*
through
his
loss
of
blood
;
but
I
,
who
at
the
same
time
began
to
*NL*
recollect
the
features
of
my
father
,
was
now
confirmed
in
my
*NL*
suspicion
,
and
satisfied
that
it
was
he
himself
who
appeared
before
*NL*
me
.
I
presently
ran
to
him
,
raised
him
in
my
arms
,
and
kissed
his
cold
*NL*
lips
with
the
utmost
eagerness
.
Here
I
must
draw
a
curtain
over
a
*NL*
scene
which
I
can
not
describe
;
for
though
I
did
not
lose
my
being
,
as
*NL*
my
father
for
a
while
did
,
my
senses
were
however
so
overpowered
with
*NL*
affright
and
surprize
,
that
I
am
a
stranger
to
what
passed
during
some
*NL*
minutes
,
and
indeed
till
my
father
had
again
recovered
from
his
swoon
,
*NL*
and
I
found
myself
in
his
arms
,
both
tenderly
embracing
each
other
,
*NL*
while
the
tears
trickled
a-pace
down
the
cheeks
of
each
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
of
those
present
seemed
affected
by
this
scene
,
which
we
,
who
*NL*
might
be
considered
as
the
actors
in
it
,
were
desirous
of
removing
*NL*
from
the
eyes
of
all
spectators
as
fast
as
we
could
;
my
father
*NL*
therefore
accepted
the
kind
offer
of
the
surgeon
's
chariot
,
and
I
*NL*
attended
him
in
it
to
his
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
were
alone
together
,
he
gently
upbraided
me
with
having
*NL*
neglected
to
write
to
him
during
so
long
a
time
,
but
entirely
omitted
*NL*
the
mention
of
that
crime
which
had
occasioned
it
.
He
then
informed
me
*NL*
of
my
mother
's
death
,
and
insisted
on
my
returning
home
with
him
,
*NL*
saying
,
`
That
he
had
long
suffered
the
greatest
anxiety
on
my
account
;
*NL*
that
he
knew
not
whether
he
had
most
feared
my
death
or
wished
it
,
*NL*
since
he
had
so
many
more
dreadful
apprehensions
for
me
.
At
last
,
he
*NL*
said
,
a
neighbouring
gentleman
,
who
had
just
recovered
a
son
from
the
*NL*
same
place
,
informed
him
where
I
was
;
and
that
to
reclaim
me
from
this
*NL*
course
of
life
was
the
sole
cause
of
his
journey
to
London
.
'
He
*NL*
thanked
Heaven
he
had
succeeded
so
far
as
to
find
me
out
by
means
of
*NL*
an
accident
which
had
like
to
have
proved
fatal
to
him
;
and
had
the
*NL*
pleasure
to
think
he
partly
owed
his
preservation
to
my
humanity
,
with
*NL*
which
he
profest
himself
to
be
more
delighted
than
he
should
have
been
*NL*
with
my
filial
piety
,
if
I
had
known
that
the
object
of
all
my
care
*NL*
was
my
own
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vice
had
not
so
depraved
my
heart
as
to
excite
in
it
an
insensibility
*NL*
of
so
much
paternal
affection
,
though
so
unworthily
bestowed
.
I
*NL*
presently
promised
to
obey
his
commands
in
my
return
home
with
him
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
was
able
to
travel
,
which
indeed
he
was
in
a
very
few
days
,
*NL*
by
the
assistance
of
that
excellent
surgeon
who
had
undertaken
his
*NL*
cure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
day
preceding
my
father
's
journey
-LRB-
before
which
time
I
scarce
*NL*
ever
left
him
-RRB-
,
I
went
to
take
my
leave
of
some
of
my
most
intimate
*NL*
acquaintance
,
particularly
of
Mr
Watson
,
who
dissuaded
me
from
burying
*NL*
myself
,
as
he
called
it
,
out
of
a
simple
compliance
with
the
fond
*NL*
desires
of
a
foolish
old
fellow
.
Such
sollicitations
,
however
,
had
no
*NL*
effect
,
and
I
once
more
saw
my
own
home
.
My
father
now
greatly
*NL*
sollicited
me
to
think
of
marriage
;
but
my
inclinations
were
utterly
*NL*
averse
to
any
such
thoughts
.
I
had
tasted
of
love
already
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
you
know
the
extravagant
excesses
of
that
most
tender
and
most
violent
*NL*
passion
.
''
--
Here
the
old
gentleman
paused
,
and
looked
earnestly
at
*NL*
Jones
;
whose
countenance
,
within
a
minute
's
space
,
displayed
the
*NL*
extremities
of
both
red
and
white
.
Upon
which
the
old
man
,
without
*NL*
making
any
observations
,
renewed
his
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
now
provided
with
all
the
necessaries
of
life
,
I
betook
myself
*NL*
once
again
to
study
,
and
that
with
a
more
inordinate
application
than
*NL*
I
had
ever
done
formerly
.
The
books
which
now
employed
my
time
solely
*NL*
were
those
,
as
well
antient
as
modern
,
which
treat
of
true
philosophy
,
*NL*
a
word
which
is
by
many
thought
to
be
the
subject
only
of
farce
and
*NL*
ridicule
.
I
now
read
over
the
works
of
Aristotle
and
Plato
,
with
the
*NL*
rest
of
those
inestimable
treasures
which
antient
Greece
had
*NL*
bequeathed
to
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
authors
,
though
they
instructed
me
in
no
science
by
which
men
*NL*
may
promise
to
themselves
to
acquire
the
least
riches
or
worldly
*NL*
power
,
taught
me
,
however
,
the
art
of
despising
the
highest
*NL*
acquisitions
of
both
.
They
elevate
the
mind
,
and
steel
and
harden
it
*NL*
against
the
capricious
invasions
of
fortune
.
They
not
only
instruct
in
*NL*
the
knowledge
of
Wisdom
,
but
confirm
men
in
her
habits
,
and
*NL*
demonstrate
plainly
,
that
this
must
be
our
guide
,
if
we
propose
ever
*NL*
to
arrive
at
the
greatest
worldly
happiness
,
or
to
defend
ourselves
,
*NL*
with
any
tolerable
security
,
against
the
misery
which
everywhere
*NL*
surrounds
and
invests
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
this
I
added
another
study
,
compared
to
which
,
all
the
philosophy
*NL*
taught
by
the
wisest
heathens
is
little
better
than
a
dream
,
and
is
*NL*
indeed
as
full
of
vanity
as
the
silliest
jester
ever
pleased
to
*NL*
represent
it
.
This
is
that
Divine
wisdom
which
is
alone
to
be
found
in
*NL*
the
Holy
Scriptures
;
for
they
impart
to
us
the
knowledge
and
assurance
*NL*
of
things
much
more
worthy
our
attention
than
all
which
this
world
can
*NL*
offer
to
our
acceptance
;
of
things
which
Heaven
itself
hath
*NL*
condescended
to
reveal
to
us
,
and
to
the
smallest
knowledge
of
which
*NL*
the
highest
human
wit
unassisted
could
never
ascend
.
I
began
now
to
*NL*
think
all
the
time
I
had
spent
with
the
best
heathen
writers
was
*NL*
little
more
than
labour
lost
:
for
,
however
pleasant
and
delightful
*NL*
their
lessons
may
be
,
or
however
adequate
to
the
right
regulation
of
*NL*
our
conduct
with
respect
to
this
world
only
;
yet
,
when
compared
with
*NL*
the
glory
revealed
in
Scripture
,
their
highest
documents
will
appear
*NL*
as
trifling
,
and
of
as
little
consequence
,
as
the
rules
by
which
*NL*
children
regulate
their
childish
little
games
and
pastime
.
True
it
is
,
*NL*
that
philosophy
makes
us
wiser
,
but
Christianity
makes
us
better
men
.
*NL*
Philosophy
elevates
and
steels
the
mind
,
Christianity
softens
and
*NL*
sweetens
it
.
The
former
makes
us
the
objects
of
human
admiration
,
the
*NL*
latter
of
Divine
love
.
That
insures
us
a
temporal
,
but
this
an
eternal
*NL*
happiness
.

I

*NL*
*NL*
Here
Jones
smiled
at
some
conceit
which
intruded
itself
into
his
*NL*
imagination
;
but
the
stranger
,
I
believe
,
perceived
it
not
,
and
*NL*
proceeded
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
circumstances
were
now
greatly
altered
by
the
death
of
that
best
*NL*
of
men
;
for
my
brother
,
who
was
now
become
master
of
the
house
,
*NL*
differed
so
widely
from
me
in
his
inclinations
,
and
our
pursuits
in
*NL*
life
had
been
so
very
various
,
that
we
were
the
worst
of
company
to
*NL*
each
other
:
but
what
made
our
living
together
still
more
disagreeable
,
*NL*
was
the
little
harmony
which
could
subsist
between
the
few
who
*NL*
resorted
to
me
,
and
the
numerous
train
of
sportsmen
who
often
attended
*NL*
my
brother
from
the
field
to
the
table
;
for
such
fellows
,
besides
the
*NL*
noise
and
nonsense
with
which
they
persecute
the
ears
of
sober
men
,
*NL*
endeavour
always
to
attack
them
with
affront
and
contempt
.
This
was
so
*NL*
much
the
case
,
that
neither
I
myself
,
nor
my
friends
,
could
ever
sit
*NL*
down
to
a
meal
with
them
without
being
treated
with
derision
,
because
*NL*
we
were
unacquainted
with
the
phrases
of
sportsmen
.
For
men
of
true
*NL*
learning
,
and
almost
universal
knowledge
,
always
compassionate
the
*NL*
ignorance
of
others
;
but
fellows
who
excel
in
some
little
,
low
,
*NL*
contemptible
art
,
are
always
certain
to
despise
those
who
are
*NL*
unacquainted
with
that
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
,
we
soon
separated
,
and
I
went
,
by
the
advice
of
a
*NL*
physician
,
to
drink
the
Bath
waters
;
for
my
violent
affliction
,
added
*NL*
to
a
sedentary
life
,
had
thrown
me
into
a
kind
of
paralytic
disorder
,
*NL*
for
which
those
waters
are
accounted
an
almost
_
certain
_
cure
.
The
*NL*
second
day
after
my
arrival
,
as
I
was
walking
by
the
river
,
the
sun
*NL*
shone
so
intensely
hot
-LRB-
though
it
was
early
in
the
year
-RRB-
,
that
I
*NL*
retired
to
the
shelter
of
some
willows
,
and
sat
down
by
the
river
*NL*
side
.
Here
I
had
not
been
seated
long
before
I
heard
a
person
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
willows
sighing
and
bemoaning
himself
bitterly
.
On
a
*NL*
sudden
,
having
uttered
a
most
impious
oath
,
he
cried
,
`
I
am
resolved
*NL*
to
bear
it
no
longer
,
'
and
directly
threw
himself
into
the
water
.
I
*NL*
immediately
started
,
and
ran
towards
the
place
,
calling
at
the
same
*NL*
time
as
loudly
as
I
could
for
assistance
.
An
angler
happened
luckily
*NL*
to
be
a-fishing
a
little
below
me
,
though
some
very
high
sedge
had
hid
*NL*
him
from
my
sight
.
He
immediately
came
up
,
and
both
of
us
together
,
*NL*
not
without
some
hazard
of
our
lives
,
drew
the
body
to
the
shore
.
At
*NL*
first
we
perceived
no
sign
of
life
remaining
;
but
having
held
the
body
*NL*
up
by
the
heels
-LRB-
for
we
soon
had
assistance
enough
-RRB-
,
it
discharged
a
*NL*
vast
quantity
of
water
at
the
mouth
,
and
at
length
began
to
discover
*NL*
some
symptoms
of
breathing
,
and
a
little
afterwards
to
move
both
its
*NL*
hands
and
its
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
apothecary
,
who
happened
to
be
present
among
others
,
advised
that
*NL*
the
body
,
which
seemed
now
to
have
pretty
well
emptied
itself
of
*NL*
water
,
and
which
began
to
have
many
convulsive
motions
,
should
be
*NL*
directly
taken
up
,
and
carried
into
a
warm
bed
.
This
was
accordingly
*NL*
performed
,
the
apothecary
and
myself
attending
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
we
were
going
towards
an
inn
,
for
we
knew
not
the
man
's
lodgings
,
*NL*
luckily
a
woman
met
us
,
who
,
after
some
violent
screaming
,
told
us
*NL*
that
the
gentleman
lodged
at
her
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
had
seen
the
man
safely
deposited
there
,
I
left
him
to
the
*NL*
care
of
the
apothecary
;
who
,
I
suppose
,
used
all
the
right
methods
*NL*
with
him
,
for
the
next
morning
I
heard
he
had
perfectly
recovered
his
*NL*
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
then
went
to
visit
him
,
intending
to
search
out
,
as
well
as
I
*NL*
could
,
the
cause
of
his
having
attempted
so
desperate
an
act
,
and
to
*NL*
prevent
,
as
far
as
I
was
able
,
his
pursuing
such
wicked
intentions
for
*NL*
the
future
.
I
was
no
sooner
admitted
into
his
chamber
,
than
we
both
*NL*
instantly
knew
each
other
;
for
who
should
this
person
be
but
my
good
*NL*
friend
Mr
Watson
!
Here
I
will
not
trouble
you
with
what
past
at
our
*NL*
first
interview
;
for
I
would
avoid
prolixity
as
much
as
*NL*
possible
.

Partridge

*NL*
``
You

material

answered
the
stranger
;
and
then
*NL*
proceeded
to
relate
what
we
shall
proceed
to
write
,
after
we
have
*NL*
given
a
short
breathing
time
to
both
ourselves

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Watson
,
''
continued
the
stranger
,
``
very
freely
acquainted
me
,
that
*NL*
the
unhappy
situation
of
his
circumstances
,
occasioned
by
a
tide
of
*NL*
ill
luck
,
had
in
a
manner
forced
him
to
a
resolution
of
destroying
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
now
began
to
argue
very
seriously
with
him
,
in
opposition
to
this
*NL*
heathenish
,
or
indeed
diabolical
,
principle
of
the
lawfulness
of
*NL*
self-murder
;
and
said
everything
which
occurred
to
me
on
the
subject
;
*NL*
but
,
to
my
great
concern
,
it
seemed
to
have
very
little
effect
on
him
.
*NL*
He
seemed
not
at
all
to
repent
of
what
he
had
done
,
and
gave
me
reason
*NL*
to
fear
he
would
soon
make
a
second
attempt
of
the
like
horrible
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
had
finished
my
discourse
,
instead
of
endeavouring
to
answer
*NL*
my
arguments
,
he
looked
me
stedfastly
in
the
face
,
and
with
a
smile
*NL*
said
,
`
You
are
strangely
altered
,
my
good
friend
,
since
I
remember
*NL*
you
.
I
question
whether
any
of
our
bishops
could
make
a
better
*NL*
argument
against
suicide
than
you
have
entertained
me
with
;
but
unless
*NL*
you
can
find
somebody
who
will
lend
me
a
cool
hundred
,
I
must
either
*NL*
hang
,
or
drown
,
or
starve
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
last
death
is
the
*NL*
most
terrible
of
the
three
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
answered
him
very
gravely
that
I
was
indeed
altered
since
I
had
*NL*
seen
him
last
.
That
I
had
found
leisure
to
look
into
my
follies
and
to
*NL*
repent
of
them
.
I
then
advised
him
to
pursue
the
same
steps
;
and
at
*NL*
last
concluded
with
an
assurance
that
I
myself
would
lend
him
a
*NL*
hundred
pound
,
if
it
would
be
of
any
service
to
his
affairs
,
and
he
*NL*
would
not
put
it
into
the
power
of
a
die
to
deprive
him
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Watson
,
who
seemed
almost
composed
in
slumber
by
the
former
part
*NL*
of
my
discourse
,
was
roused
by
the
latter
.
He
seized
my
hand
eagerly
,
*NL*
gave
me
a
thousand
thanks
,
and
declared
I
was
a
friend
indeed
;
adding
*NL*
that
he
hoped
I
had
a
better
opinion
of
him
than
to
imagine
he
had
*NL*
profited
so
little
by
experience
,
as
to
put
any
confidence
in
those
*NL*
damned
dice
which
had
so
often
deceived
him
.
`
No
,
no
,
'
cries
he
;
`
let
*NL*
me
but
once
handsomely
be
set
up
again
,
and
if
ever
Fortune
makes
a
*NL*
broken
merchant
of
me
afterwards
,
I
will
forgive
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
very
well
understood
the
language
of
setting
up
,
and
broken
*NL*
merchant
.
I
therefore
said
to
him
,
with
a
very
grave
face
,
Mr
Watson
,
*NL*
you
must
endeavour
to
find
out
some
business
or
employment
,
by
which
*NL*
you
may
procure
yourself
a
livelihood
;
and
I
promise
you
,
could
I
see
*NL*
any
probability
of
being
repaid
hereafter
,
I
would
advance
a
much
*NL*
larger
sum
than
what
you
have
mentioned
,
to
equip
you
in
any
fair
and
*NL*
honourable
calling
;
but
as
to
gaming
,
besides
the
baseness
and
*NL*
wickedness
of
making
it
a
profession
,
you
are
really
,
to
my
own
*NL*
knowledge
,
unfit
for
it
,
and
it
will
end
in
your
certain
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Why
now
,
that
's
strange
,
'
answered
he
;
`
neither
you
,
nor
any
of
my
*NL*
friends
,
would
ever
allow
me
to
know
anything
of
the
matter
,
and
yet
I
*NL*
believe
I
_
am
_
as
good
a
hand
at
every
game
as
any
of
you
all
;
and
I
*NL*
heartily
wish
I
was
to
play
with
you
only
for
your
whole
fortune
:
I
*NL*
should
desire
no
better
sport
,
and
I
would
let
you
name
your
game
into
*NL*
the
bargain
:
but
come
,
my
dear
boy
,
have
you
the
hundred
in
your
*NL*
pocket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
answered
I
had
only
a
bill
for
L50
,
which
I
delivered
him
,
and
*NL*
promised
to
bring
him
the
rest
next
morning
;
and
after
giving
him
a
*NL*
little
more
advice
,
took
my
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
indeed
better
than
my
word
;
for
I
returned
to
him
that
very
*NL*
afternoon
.
When
I
entered
the
room
,
I
found
him
sitting
up
in
his
bed
*NL*
at
cards
with
a
notorious
gamester
.
This
sight
,
you
will
imagine
,
*NL*
shocked
me
not
a
little
;
to
which
I
may
add
the
mortification
of
*NL*
seeing
my
bill
delivered
by
him
to
his
antagonist
,
and
thirty
guineas
*NL*
only
given
in
exchange
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
other
gamester
presently
quitted
the
room
,
and
then
Watson
*NL*
declared
he
was
ashamed
to
see
me
;
`
but
,
'
says
he
,
`
I
find
luck
runs
*NL*
so
damnably
against
me
,
that
I
will
resolve
to
leave
off
play
for
*NL*
ever
.
I
have
thought
of
the
kind
proposal
you
made
me
ever
since
,
and
*NL*
I
promise
you
there
shall
be
no
fault
in
me
,
if
I
do
not
put
it
in
*NL*
execution
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
I
had
no
great
faith
in
his
promises
,
I
produced
him
the
*NL*
remainder
of
the
hundred
in
consequence
of
my
own
;
for
which
he
gave
*NL*
me
a
note
,
which
was
all
I
ever
expected
to
see
in
return
for
my
*NL*
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
prevented
from
any
further
discourse
at
present
by
the
*NL*
arrival
of
the
apothecary
;
who
,
with
much
joy
in
his
countenance
,
and
*NL*
without
even
asking
his
patient
how
he
did
,
proclaimed
there
was
great
*NL*
news
arrived
in
a
letter
to
himself
,
which
he
said
would
shortly
be
*NL*
public
,
`
That
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
was
landed
in
the
west
with
a
vast
*NL*
army
of
Dutch
;
and
that
another
vast
fleet
hovered
over
the
coast
of
*NL*
Norfolk
,
and
was
to
make
a
descent
there
,
in
order
to
favour
the
*NL*
duke
's
enterprize
with
a
diversion
on
that
side
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
apothecary
was
one
of
the
greatest
politicians
of
his
time
.
He
*NL*
was
more
delighted
with
the
most
paultry
packet
,
than
with
the
best
*NL*
patient
,
and
the
highest
joy
he
was
capable
of
,
he
received
from
*NL*
having
a
piece
of
news
in
his
possession
an
hour
or
two
sooner
than
*NL*
any
other
person
in
the
town
.
His
advices
,
however
,
were
seldom
*NL*
authentic
;
for
he
would
swallow
almost
anything
as
a
truth
--
a
humour
*NL*
which
many
made
use
of
to
impose
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
it
happened
with
what
he
at
present
communicated
;
for
it
was
*NL*
known
within
a
short
time
afterwards
that
the
duke
was
really
landed
,
*NL*
but
that
his
army
consisted
only
of
a
few
attendants
;
and
as
to
the
*NL*
diversion
in
Norfolk
,
it
was
entirely
false
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
apothecary
staid
no
longer
in
the
room
than
while
he
acquainted
*NL*
us
with
his
news
;
and
then
,
without
saying
a
syllable
to
his
patient
*NL*
on
any
other
subject
,
departed
to
spread
his
advices
all
over
the
*NL*
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Events
of
this
nature
in
the
public
are
generally
apt
to
eclipse
all
*NL*
private
concerns
.
Our
discourse
therefore
now
became
entirely
*NL*
political
.
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
For
my
own
part
,
I
had
been
for
some
time
very
seriously
*NL*
affected
with
the
danger
to
which
the
Protestant
religion
was
so
*NL*
visibly
exposed
under
a
Popish
prince
,
and
thought
the
apprehension
of
*NL*
it
alone
sufficient
to
justify
that
insurrection
;
for
no
real
security
*NL*
can
ever
be
found
against
the
persecuting
spirit
of
Popery
,
when
armed
*NL*
with
power
,
except
the
depriving
it
of
that
power
,
as
woeful
*NL*
experience
presently
showed
.
You
know
how
King
James
behaved
after
*NL*
getting
the
better
of
this
attempt
;
how
little
he
valued
either
his
*NL*
royal
word
,
or
coronation
oath
,
or
the
liberties
and
rights
of
his
*NL*
people
.
But
all
had
not
the
sense
to
foresee
this
at
first
;
and
*NL*
therefore
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
was
weakly
supported
;
yet
all
could
*NL*
feel
when
the
evil
came
upon
them
;
and
therefore
all
united
,
at
last
,
*NL*
to
drive
out
that
king
,
against
whose
exclusion
a
great
party
among
us
*NL*
had
so
warmly
contended
during
the
reign
of
his
brother
,
and
for
whom
*NL*
they
now
fought
with
such
zeal
and
affection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
say
,
''
interrupted
Jones
,
``
is
very
true
;
and
it
has
often
*NL*
struck
me

as
the
most
wonderful
thing
I
ever
read
of
in
history
,
that
*NL*
so
soon
after
this
convincing
experience
which
brought
our
whole
*NL*
nation
to
join
so
unanimously
in
expelling
King
James
,
for
the
*NL*
preservation
of
our
religion
and
liberties
,
there
should
be
a
party
*NL*
among
us
mad
enough
to
desire
the
placing
his
family
again
on
the
*NL*
throne
.
''
``
You
are
not
in
earnest
!
''
answered
the
old
man
;
``
there
can
be
*NL*
no
such
party
.
As
bad
an
opinion
as
I
have
of
mankind
,
I
can
not
*NL*
believe
them
infatuated
to
such
a
degree
.
There
may
be
some
hot-headed
*NL*
Papists
led
by
their
priests
to
engage
in
this
desperate
cause
,
and
*NL*
think
it
a
holy
war
;
but
that
Protestants
,
that
are
members
of
the
*NL*
Church
of
England
,
should
be
such
apostates
,
such
_
felos
de
se
_
,
I
*NL*
can
not
believe
it
;
no
,
no
,
young
man
,
unacquainted
as
I
am
with
what
*NL*
has
past
in
the
world
for
these
last
thirty
years
,
I
can
not
be
so
*NL*
imposed
upon
as
to
credit
so
foolish
a
tale
;
but
I
see
you
have
a
mind
*NL*
to
sport
with
my
ignorance

''
--
``
Can
it
be
possible
,
''
replied
Jones
,
*NL*
``
that
you
have
lived
so
much
out
of
the
world
as
not
to
know
that
*NL*
during
that
time
there
have
been
two
rebellions
in
favour
of
the
son
*NL*
of
King
James
,
one
of
which
is
now
actually
raging
in
the
very
heart
*NL*
of
the
kingdom
.
''
At
these
words
the
old
gentleman
started
up
,
and
in
a
*NL*
most
solemn
tone
of
voice
,
conjured
Jones
by
his
Maker
to
tell
him
if
*NL*
what
he
said
was
really
true
;
which
the
other
as
solemnly
affirming
,
*NL*
he
walked
several
turns
about
the
room
in
a
profound
silence
,
then
*NL*
cried
,
then
laughed
,
and
at
last
fell
down
on
his
knees
,
and
blessed
*NL*
God
,
in
a
loud
thanksgiving
prayer
,
for
having
delivered
him
from
all
*NL*
society
with
human
nature
,
which
could
be
capable
of
such
monstrous
*NL*
extravagances
.
After
which
,
being
reminded
by
Jones
that
he
had
broke
*NL*
off
his
story
,
he
resumed
it
again
in
this
manner
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
mankind
,
in
the
days
I
was
speaking
of
,
was
not
yet
arrived
at
*NL*
that
pitch
of
madness
which
I
find
they
are
capable
of
now
,
and
which
,
*NL*
to
be
sure
,
I
have
only
escaped
by
living
alone
,
and
at
a
distance
*NL*
from
the
contagion
,
there
was
a
considerable
rising
in
favour
of
*NL*
Monmouth
;
and
my
principles
strongly
inclining
me
to
take
the
same
*NL*
part
,
I
determined
to
join
him
;
and
Mr
Watson
,
from
different
motives
*NL*
concurring
in
the
same
resolution
-LRB-
for
the
spirit
of
a
gamester
will
*NL*
carry
a
man
as
far
upon
such
an
occasion
as
the
spirit
of
patriotism
-RRB-
,
*NL*
we
soon
provided
ourselves
with
all
necessaries
,
and
went
to
the
duke

at
Bridgewater

The
unfortunate
event
of
this
enterprize
,
you
are
,
I
conclude
,
as

well
acquainted
with
as
myself

I
escaped
,
together
with
Mr
Watson
,
*NL*
from
the
battle
at
Sedgemore
,
in
which
action
I
received
a
slight
*NL*
wound
.
We
rode
near
forty
miles
together
on
the
Exeter
road
,
and
then
*NL*
abandoning
our
horses
,
scrambled
as
well
as
we
could
through
the
*NL*
fields
and
bye-roads
,
till
we
arrived
at
a
little
wild
hut
on
a
*NL*
common
,
where
a
poor
old
woman
took
all
the
care
of
us
she
could
,
and
*NL*
dressed
my
wound
with
salve
,
which
quickly
healed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
sir
,
where
was
the
wound
?
''
says
Partridge
.
The
stranger
*NL*
satisfied
him
it
was
in
his
arm
,
and
then
continued
his
narrative
.
*NL*
``
Here
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
Mr
Watson
left
me
the
next
morning
,
in
order

*NL*
as
he
pretended
,
to
get
us
some
provision
from
the
town
of
Collumpton
;
*NL*

--
can
I
relate
it
,
or
can
you
believe
it

--
this
Mr
Watson
,
this
*NL*
friend
,
this
base
,
barbarous
,
treacherous
villain
,
betrayed
me
to
a
*NL*
party
of
horse
belonging
to
King
James
,
and
at
his
return
delivered
me
*NL*
into
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
soldiers
,
being
six
in
number
,
had
now
seized
me
,
and
were
*NL*
conducting
me
to
Taunton
gaol
;
but
neither
my
present
situation
,
nor
*NL*
the
apprehensions
of
what
might
happen
to
me
,
were
half
so
irksome
to
*NL*
my
mind
as
the
company
of
my
false
friend
,
who
,
having
surrendered
*NL*
himself
,
was
likewise
considered
as
a
prisoner
,
though
he
was
better
*NL*
treated
,
as
being
to
make
his
peace
at
my
expense
.
He
at
first
*NL*
endeavoured
to
excuse
his
treachery
;
but
when
he
received
nothing
but
*NL*
scorn
and
upbraiding
from
me
,
he
soon
changed
his
note
,
abused
me
as
*NL*
the
most
atrocious
and
malicious
rebel
,
and
laid
all
his
own
guilt
to
*NL*
my
charge
,
who
,
as
he
declared
,
had
solicited
,
and
even
threatened
*NL*
him
,
to
make
him
take
up
arms
against
his
gracious
as
well
as
lawful
*NL*
sovereign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
false
evidence
-LRB-
for
in
reality
he
had
been
much
the
forwarder
of
*NL*
the
two
-RRB-
stung
me
to
the
quick
,
and
raised
an
indignation
scarce
*NL*
conceivable
by
those
who
have
not
felt
it
.
However
,
fortune
at
length
*NL*
took
pity
on
me
;
for
as
we
were
got
a
little
beyond
Wellington
,
in
a
*NL*
narrow
lane
,
my
guards
received
a
false
alarm
,
that
near
fifty
of
the
*NL*
enemy
were
at
hand
;
upon
which
they
shifted
for
themselves
,
and
left
*NL*
me
and
my
betrayer
to
do
the
same
.
That
villain
immediately
ran
from
*NL*
me
,
and
I
am
glad
he
did
,
or
I
should
have
certainly
endeavoured
,
*NL*
though
I
had
no
arms
,
to
have
executed
vengeance
on
his
baseness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
now
once
more
at
liberty
;
and
immediately
withdrawing
from
the
*NL*
highway
into
the
fields
,
I
travelled
on
,
scarce
knowing
which
way
I
*NL*
went
,
and
making
it
my
chief
care
to
avoid
all
public
roads
and
all
*NL*
towns
--
nay
,
even
the
most
homely
houses
;
for
I
imagined
every
human
*NL*
creature
whom
I
saw
desirous
of
betraying
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
,
after
rambling
several
days
about
the
country
,
during
which
*NL*
the
fields
afforded
me
the
same
bed
and
the
same
food
which
nature
*NL*
bestows
on
our
savage
brothers
of
the
creation
,
I
at
length
arrived
at
*NL*
this
place
,
where
the
solitude
and
wildness
of
the
country
invited
me
*NL*
to
fix
my
abode
.
The
first
person
with
whom
I
took
up
my
habitation
*NL*
was
the
mother
of
this
old
woman
,
with
whom
I
remained
concealed
till
*NL*
the
news
of
the
glorious
revolution
put
an
end
to
all
my
apprehensions
*NL*
of
danger
,
and
gave
me
an
opportunity
of
once
more
visiting
my
own
*NL*
home
,
and
of
enquiring
a
little
into
my
affairs
,
which
I
soon
settled
*NL*
as
agreeably
to
my
brother
as
to
myself
;
having
resigned
everything
to
*NL*
him
,
for
which
he
paid
me
the
sum
of
a
thousand
pounds
,
and
settled
on
*NL*
me
an
annuity
for
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
behaviour
in
this
last
instance
,
as
in
all
others
,
was
selfish
*NL*
and
ungenerous
.
I
could
not
look
on
him
as
my
friend
,
nor
indeed
did
*NL*
he
desire
that
I
should
;
so
I
presently
took
my
leave
of
him
,
as
well
*NL*
as
of
my
other
acquaintance
;
and
from
that
day
to
this
,
my
history
is
*NL*
little
better
than
a
blank

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
it
possible

said
Jones
,
``

you
can
have
resided
here
*NL*
from
that
day
to
this
?

``
O
no

answered
the
gentleman
;

I
have

cried
Jones

``
the
assurance

indeed
it
would
be
cruel
,
after
so
much
breath
as
*NL*
you
have
already
spent
:
but
you
will
give
me
leave
to
wish
for
some
*NL*
further
opportunity
of
hearing
the
excellent
observations
which
a
man
*NL*
of
your
sense
and
knowledge
of
the
world
must
have
made
in
so
long
a
*NL*
course
of
travels

``
Indeed

answered
the
stranger
,
*NL*
``
I
will
endeavour
to
satisfy
your
curiosity
on
this
head
likewise

as
*NL*
far

am
able

Jones
attempted
fresh
apologies
,
but
was
prevented
;
*NL*
and
while
he
and
Partridge
sat
with
greedy
and
impatient
ears
,
the
*NL*
stranger
proceeded
as
in
the
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

_
The
rest
of
this
paragraph
and
the
two
following
paragraphs
*NL*
in
the
first
edition
were
as
follows
_
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
own
part
,
I
had
been
for
some
time
very
seriously
affected
*NL*
with
the
danger
to
which
the
Protestant
religion
was
so
visibly
*NL*
exposed
,
that
nothing
but
the
immediate
interposition
of
Providence
*NL*
seemed
capable
of
preserving
it
;
for
King
James
had
indeed
declared
*NL*
war
against
the
Protestant
cause
.
He
had
brought
known
papists
into
*NL*
the
army
and
attempted
to
bring
them
into
the
Church
and
into
the
*NL*
University
.
Popish
priests
swarmed
through
the
nation
,
appeared
*NL*
publicly
in
their
habits
,
and
boasted
that
they
should
shortly
walk
*NL*
in
procession
through
the
streets
.
Our
own
clergy
were
forbid
to
*NL*
preach
against
popery
,
and
bishops
were
ordered
to
supend
those
who
*NL*
did
;
and
to
do
the
business
at
once
an
illegal
ecclesiastical
*NL*
commission
was
erected
,
little
inferior
to
an
inquisition
,
of
which
,
*NL*
probably
,
it
was
intended
to
be
the
ringleader
.
Thus
,
as
our
duty
to
*NL*
the
king
can
never
be
called
more
than
our
second
duty
,
he
had
*NL*
discharged
us
from
this
by
making
it
incompatible
with
our
*NL*
preserving
the
first
,
which
is
surely
to
heaven
.
Besides
this
,
he
*NL*
had
dissolved
his
subjects
from
their
allegiance
by
breaking
his
*NL*
Coronation
Oath
,
to
which
their
allegiance
is
annexed
;
for
he
had
*NL*
imprisoned
bishops
because
they
would
not
give
up
their
religion
,
*NL*
and
turned
out
judges
because
they
would
not
absolutely
surrender
*NL*
the
law
into
his
hands
;
nay
,
he
seized
this
himself
,
and
when
he
*NL*
claimed
a
dispensing
power
,
he
declared
himself
,
in
fact
,
as
*NL*
absolute
as
any
tyrant
ever
was
or
can
be
.
I
have
recapitulated
*NL*
these
matters
in
full
lest
some
of
them
should
have
been
omitted
in
*NL*
history
;
and
I
think
nothing
less
than
such
provocations
as
I
have
*NL*
here
mentioned
,
nothing
less
than
certain
and
imminent
danger
to
*NL*
their
religion
and
liberties
,
can
justify
or
even
mitigate
the
*NL*
dreadful
sin
of
rebellion
in
any
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
you
,
sir
,
''
says
Jones
,
``
all
these
facts
,
and
more
,
I
have
*NL*
read
in
history
,
but
I
will
tell
you
a
fact
which
is
not
yet
*NL*
recorded
and
of
which
I
suppose
you
are
ignorant
.
There
is
actually
*NL*
now
a
rebellion
on
foot
in
this
kingdom
in
favour
of
the
son
of
that
*NL*
very
King
James
,
a
professed
papist
,
more
bigoted
,
if
possible
,
than
*NL*
his
father
,
and
this
carried
on
by
Protestants
against
a
king
who
*NL*
hath
never
in
one
single
instance
made
the
least
invasion
on
our
*NL*
liberties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prodigious
indeed
!
''
answered
the
stranger
.
``
You
tell
me
what
would
*NL*
be
incredible
of
a
nation
which
did
not
deserve
the
character
that
*NL*
Virgil
gives
of
a
woman
,
_
varium
et
mutabile

Surely
this
is
*NL*
to
be
unworthy
of
the
care
which
Providence
seems
to
have
taken
of
*NL*
us
in
the
preservation
of
our
religion
against
the
powerful
designs
*NL*
and
constant
machinations
of
Popery
,
a
preservation
so
strange
and
*NL*
unaccountable
that
I
almost
think
we
may
appeal
to
it
as
to
a
*NL*
miracle
for
the
proof
of
its
holiness
.
Prodigious
indeed
!
A
*NL*
Protestant
rebellion
in
favour
of
a
popish
prince
!
The
folly
of
*NL*
mankind
is
as
wonderful
as
their
knavery
--
But
to
conclude
my
story
:
*NL*
I
resolved
to
take
arms
in
defence
of
my
country
,
of
my
religion
,
*NL*
and
my
liberty
,
and
Mr.
Watson
joined
in
the
same
resolution

We
*NL*
soon
provided
ourselves
with
an

and
joined
the
Duke

A

``
In
Italy
the
landlords
are
very
silent

In

they
are
more
*NL*
talkative
,
but
yet
civil

In
Germany

they
are
generally

very
impertinent

And
as
for
their
honesty

I
believe
it
is
pretty

equal
in

as
for

I
think

These

I
made

were

with

God
has
been

pleased
to
enrich
the
several
parts
of
this
globe
;
a
variety
which
,
as
*NL*
it
must
give
great
pleasure
to
a
contemplative
beholder
,
so
doth
it
*NL*
admirably
display
the
power
,
and
wisdom
,
and
goodness
of
the
Creator
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
to
say
the
truth
,
there
is
but
one
work
in
his
whole
creation
*NL*
that
doth
him
any
dishonour
,
and
with
that
I
have
long
since
avoided
*NL*
holding
any
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
pardon
me
,
''
cries
Jones
;
``
but
I
have
always
imagined
that
*NL*
there
is
in
this
very
work
you
mention
as
great
variety
as
in
all
the
*NL*
rest
;
for
,
besides
the
difference
of
inclination
,
customs
and
climates
*NL*
have
,
I
am
told
,
introduced
the
utmost
diversity
into
human
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
little
indeed
,
''
answered
the
other
:
``
those
who
travel
in
order
*NL*
to
acquaint
themselves
with
the
different
manners
of
men
might
spare
*NL*
themselves
much
pains
by
going
to
a
carnival
at
Venice
;
for
there
they
*NL*
will
see
at
once
all
which
they
can
discover
in
the
several
courts
of
*NL*
Europe
.
The
same
hypocrisy
,
the
same
fraud
;
in
short
,
the
same
follies
*NL*
and
vices
dressed
in
different
habits
.
In
Spain
,
these
are
equipped
*NL*
with
much
gravity
;
and
in
Italy
,
with
vast
splendor
.
In
France
,
a
*NL*
knave
is
dressed
like
a
fop
;
and
in
the
northern
countries
,
like
a
*NL*
sloven
.
But
human
nature
is
everywhere
the
same
,
everywhere
the
object
*NL*
of
detestation
and
scorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
my
own
part
,
I
past
through
all
these
nations
as
you
perhaps
*NL*
may
have
done
through
a
croud
at
a
shew-jostling
to
get
by
them
,
*NL*
holding
my
nose
with
one
hand
,
and
defending
my
pockets
with
the
*NL*
other
,
without
speaking
a
word
to
any
of
them
,
while
I
was
pressing
on
*NL*
to
see
what
I
wanted
to
see
;
which
,
however
entertaining
it
might
be
*NL*
in
itself
,
scarce
made
me
amends
for
the
trouble
the
company
gave
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
not
you
find
some
of
the
nations
among
which
you
travelled
less
*NL*
troublesome
to
you
than
others
?
''
said
Jones
.
``
O
yes
,
''
replied
the
old
*NL*
man
:
``
the
Turks
were
much
more
tolerable
to
me
than
the
Christians
;
*NL*
for
they
are
men
of
profound
taciturnity
,
and
never
disturb
a
stranger
*NL*
with
questions
.
Now
and
then
indeed
they
bestow
a
short
curse
upon
*NL*
him
,
or
spit
in
his
face
as
he
walks
the
streets
,
but
then
they
have
*NL*
done
with
him
;
and
a
man
may
live
an
age
in
their
country
without
*NL*
hearing
a
dozen
words
from
them
.
But
of
all
the
people
I
ever
saw
,
*NL*
heaven
defend
me
from
the
French
!
With
their
damned
prate
and
*NL*
civilities
,
and
doing
the
honour
of
their
nation
to
strangers
-LRB-
as
they
*NL*
are
pleased
to
call
it
-RRB-
,
but
indeed
setting
forth
their
own
vanity
;
*NL*
they
are
so
troublesome
,
that
I
had
infinitely
rather
pass
my
life
*NL*
with
the
Hottentots
than
set
my
foot
in
Paris
again
.
They
are
a
nasty
*NL*
people
,
but
their
nastiness
is
mostly
without
;
whereas
,
in
France
,
and
*NL*
some
other
nations
that
I
wo
n't
name
,
it
is
all
within
,
and
makes
them
*NL*
stink
much
more
to
my
reason
than
that
of
Hottentots
does
to
my
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
,
sir
,
I
have
ended
the
history
of
my
life
;
for
as
to
all
that
*NL*
series
of
years
during
which
I
have
lived
retired
here
,
it
affords
no
*NL*
variety
to
entertain
you
,
and
may
be
almost
considered
as
one
*NL*
day
.
-LSB-

-RSB-
The
retirement
has
been
so
compleat
,
that
I
could
hardly
have
*NL*
enjoyed
a
more
absolute
solitude
in
the
deserts
of
the
Thebais
than
*NL*
here
in
the
midst
of
this
populous
kingdom
.
As
I
have
no
estate
,
I
am
*NL*
plagued
with
no
tenants
or
stewards
:
my
annuity
is
paid
me
pretty
*NL*
regularly
,
as
indeed
it
ought
to
be
;
for
it
is
much
less
than
what
I
*NL*
might
have
expected
in
return
for
what
I
gave
up
.
Visits
I
admit
none
;
*NL*
and
the
old
woman
who
keeps
my
house
knows
that
her
place
entirely
*NL*
depends
upon
her
saving
me
all
the
trouble
of
buying
the
things
that
I
*NL*
want
,
keeping
off
all
sollicitation
or
business
from
me
,
and
holding
*NL*
her
tongue
whenever
I
am
within
hearing
.
As
my
walks
are
all
by
night
,
*NL*
I
am
pretty
secure
in
this
wild
unfrequented
place
from
meeting
any
*NL*
company
.
Some
few
persons
I
have
met
by
chance
,
and
sent
them
home
*NL*
heartily
frighted
,
as
from
the
oddness
of
my
dress
and
figure
they
*NL*
took
me
for
a
ghost
or
a
hobgoblin
.
But
what
has
happened
to-night
*NL*
shows
that
even
here
I
can
not
be
safe
from
the
villany
of
men
;
for
*NL*
without
your
assistance
I
had
not
only
been
robbed
,
but
very
probably
*NL*
murdered
.

*NL*
Jones
thanked
the
stranger
for
the
trouble
he
had
taken
in
relating
*NL*
his
story
,
and
then
expressed
some
wonder
how
he
could
possibly
endure
*NL*
a
life
of
such
solitude
;
``
in
which
,
''
says
he
,
``
you
may
well
complain
*NL*
of
the
want
of
variety
.
Indeed
I
am
astonished
how
you
have
filled
up
,
*NL*
or
rather
killed
,
so
much
of
your
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
at
all
surprized
,
''
answered
the
other
,
``
that
to
one
whose
*NL*
affections
and
thoughts
are
fixed
on
the
world
my
hours
should
appear
*NL*
to
have
wanted
employment
in
this
place
:
but
there
is
one
single
act
,
*NL*
for
which
the
whole
life
of
man
is
infinitely
too
short
:
what
time
can
*NL*
suffice
for
the
contemplation
and
worship
of
that
glorious
,
immortal
,
*NL*
and
eternal
Being
,
among
the
works
of
whose
stupendous
creation
not
*NL*
only
this
globe
,
but
even
those
numberless
luminaries
which
we
may
*NL*
here
behold
spangling
all
the
sky
,
though
they
should
many
of
them
be
*NL*
suns
lighting
different
systems
of
worlds
,
may
possibly
appear
but
as
*NL*
a
few
atoms
opposed
to
the
whole
earth
which
we
inhabit
?
Can
a
man
who
*NL*
by
divine
meditations
is
admitted
as
it
were
into
the
conversation
of
*NL*
this
ineffable
,
incomprehensible
Majesty
,
think
days
,
or
years
,
or
*NL*
ages
,
too
long
for
the
continuance
of
so
ravishing
an
honour
?
Shall
*NL*
the
trifling
amusements
,
the
palling
pleasures
,
the
silly
business
of
*NL*
the
world
,
roll
away
our
hours
too
swiftly
from
us
;
and
shall
the
pace
*NL*
of
time
seem
sluggish
to
a
mind
exercised
in
studies
so
high
,
so
*NL*
important
,
and
so
glorious
?
As
no
time
is
sufficient
,
so
no
place
is
*NL*
improper
,
for
this
great
concern
.
On
what
object
can
we
cast
our
eyes
*NL*
which
may
not
inspire
us
with
ideas
of
his
power
,
of
his
wisdom
,
and
*NL*
of
his
goodness
?
It
is
not
necessary
that
the
rising
sun
should
dart
*NL*
his
fiery
glories
over
the
eastern
horizon
;
nor
that
the
boisterous
*NL*
winds
should
rush
from
their
caverns
,
and
shake
the
lofty
forest
;
nor
*NL*
that
the
opening
clouds
should
pour
their
deluges
on
the
plains
:
it
is
*NL*
not
necessary
,
I
say
,
that
any
of
these
should
proclaim
his
majesty
:
*NL*
there
is
not
an
insect
,
not
a
vegetable
,
of
so
low
an
order
in
the
*NL*
creation
as
not
to
be
honoured
with
bearing
marks
of
the
attributes
of
*NL*
its
great
Creator
;
marks
not
only
of
his
power
,
but
of
his
wisdom
and
*NL*
goodness
.
Man
alone
,
the
king
of
this
globe
,
the
last
and
greatest
*NL*
work
of
the
Supreme
Being
,
below
the
sun
;
man
alone
hath
basely
*NL*
dishonoured
his
own
nature
;
and
by
dishonesty
,
cruelty
,
ingratitude
,
*NL*
and
treachery
,
hath
called
his
Maker
's
goodness
in
question
,
by
*NL*
puzzling
us
to
account
how
a
benevolent
being
should
form
so
foolish
*NL*
and
so
vile
an
animal
.
Yet
this
is
the
being
from
whose
conversation
*NL*
you
think
,
I
suppose
,
that
I
have
been
unfortunately
restrained
,
and
*NL*
without
whose
blessed
society
,
life
,
in
your
opinion
,
must
be
tedious
*NL*
and
insipid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
former
part
of
what
you
said
,
''
replied
Jones
,
``
I
most
heartily
*NL*
and
readily
concur
;
but
I
believe
,
as
well
as
hope
,
that
the
*NL*
abhorrence
which
you
express
for
mankind
in
the
conclusion
,
is
much
*NL*
too
general
.
Indeed
,
you
here
fall
into
an
error
,
which
in
my
little
*NL*
experience
I
have
observed
to
be
a
very
common
one
,
by
taking
the
*NL*
character
of
mankind
from
the
worst
and
basest
among
them
;
whereas
,
*NL*
indeed
,
as
an
excellent
writer
observes
,
nothing
should
be
esteemed
as
*NL*
characteristical
of
a
species
,
but
what
is
to
be
found
among
the
best
*NL*
and
most
perfect
individuals
of
that
species
.
This
error
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
is
generally
committed
by
those
who
from
want
of
proper
caution
in
the
*NL*
choice
of
their
friends
and
acquaintance
,
have
suffered
injuries
from
*NL*
bad
and
worthless
men
;
two
or
three
instances
of
which
are
very
*NL*
unjustly
charged
on
all
human
nature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
had
experience
enough
of
it
,
''
answered
the
other
:
``
my
first
*NL*
mistress
and
my
first
friend
betrayed
me
in
the
basest
manner
,
and
in
*NL*
matters
which
threatened
to
be
of
the
worst
of
consequences
--
even
to
*NL*
bring
me
to
a
shameful
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
pardon
me
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
if
I
desire
you
to
reflect
who
*NL*
that
mistress
and
who
that
friend
were
.
What
better
,
my
good
sir
,
*NL*
could
be
expected
in
love
derived
from
the
stews
,
or
in
friendship
*NL*
first
produced
and
nourished
at
the
gaming-table
?
To
take
the
*NL*
characters
of
women
from
the
former
instance
,
or
of
men
from
the
*NL*
latter
,
would
be
as
unjust
as
to
assert
that
air
is
a
nauseous
and
*NL*
unwholesome
element
,
because
we
find
it
so
in
a
jakes
.
I
have
lived
*NL*
but
a
short
time
in
the
world
,
and
yet
have
known
men
worthy
of
the
*NL*
highest
friendship
,
and
women
of
the
highest
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
young
man
,
''
answered
the
stranger
,
``
you
have
lived
,
you
*NL*
confess
,
but
a
very
short
time
in
the
world
:
I
was
somewhat
older
than
*NL*
you
when
I
was
of
the
same
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
have
remained
so
still
,
''
replies
Jones
,
``
if
you
had
not
*NL*
been
unfortunate
,
I
will
venture
to
say
incautious
,
in
the
placing
*NL*
your
affections
.
If
there
was
,
indeed
,
much
more
wickedness
in
the
*NL*
world
than
there
is
,
it
would
not
prove
such
general
assertions
*NL*
against
human
nature
,
since
much
of
this
arrives
by
mere
accident
,
and
*NL*
many
a
man
who
commits
evil
is
not
totally
bad
and
corrupt
in
his
*NL*
heart
.
In
truth
,
none
seem
to
have
any
title
to
assert
human
nature
to
*NL*
be
necessarily
and
universally
evil
,
but
those
whose
own
minds
afford
*NL*
them
one
instance
of
this
natural
depravity
;
which
is
not
,
I
am
*NL*
convinced
,
your
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
such
,
''
said
the
stranger
,
``
will
be
always
the
most
backward
to
*NL*
assert
any
such
thing
.
Knaves
will
no
more
endeavour
to
persuade
us
of
*NL*
the
baseness
of
mankind
,
than
a
highwayman
will
inform
you
that
there
*NL*
are
thieves
on
the
road
.
This
would
,
indeed
,
be
a
method
to
put
you
on
*NL*
your
guard
,
and
to
defeat
their
own
purposes
.
For
which
reason
,
though
*NL*
knaves
,
as
I
remember
,
are
very
apt
to
abuse
particular
persons
,
yet
*NL*
they
never
cast
any
reflection
on
human
nature
in
general
.
''
The
old
*NL*
gentleman
spoke
this
so
warmly
,
that
as
Jones
despaired
of
making
a
*NL*
convert
,
and
was
unwilling
to
offend
,
he
returned
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
now
began
to
send
forth
its
first
streams
of
light
,
when
Jones
*NL*
made
an
apology
to
the
stranger
for
having
staid
so
long
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
detained
him
from
his
rest
.
The
stranger
answered
,
``
He
never
wanted
*NL*
rest
less
than
at
present
;
for
that
day
and
night
were
indifferent
*NL*
seasons
to
him
;
and
that
he
commonly
made
use
of
the
former
for
the
*NL*
time
of
his
repose
and
of
the
latter
for
his
walks
and
lucubrations
.
*NL*
However
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
is
now
a
most
lovely
morning
,
and
if
you
can
*NL*
bear
any
longer
to
be
without
your
own
rest
or
food
,
I
will
gladly
*NL*
entertain
you
with
the
sight
of
some
very
fine
prospects
which
I
*NL*
believe
you
have
not
yet
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
very
readily
embraced
this
offer
,
and
they
immediately
set
*NL*
forward
together
from
the
cottage
.
As
for
Partridge
,
he
had
fallen
*NL*
into
a
profound
repose
just
as
the
stranger
had
finished
his
story
;
*NL*
for
his
curiosity
was
satisfied
,
and
the
subsequent
discourse
was
not
*NL*
forcible
enough
in
its
operation
to
conjure
down
the
charms
of
sleep
.
*NL*
Jones
therefore
left
him
to
enjoy
his
nap
;
and
as
the
reader
may
*NL*
perhaps
be
at
this
season
glad
of
the
same
favour
,
we
will
here
put
an
*NL*
end
to

eighth
book

Chapter
i.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
those
who
lawfully
may
,
and
of
those
who
may
not
,
write
such
*NL*
histories
as
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
good
uses
for
which
I
have
thought
proper
to
institute
*NL*
these
several
introductory
chapters
,
I
have
considered
them
as
a
kind
*NL*
of
mark
or
stamp
,
which
may
hereafter
enable
a
very
indifferent
reader
*NL*
to
distinguish
what
is
true
and
genuine
in
this
historic
kind
of
*NL*
writing
,
from
what
is
false
and
counterfeit
.
Indeed
,
it
seems
likely
*NL*
that
some
such
mark
may
shortly
become
necessary
,
since
the
favourable
*NL*
reception
which
two
or
three
authors
have
lately
procured
for
their
*NL*
works
of
this
nature
from
the
public
,
will
probably
serve
as
an
*NL*
encouragement
to
many
others
to
undertake
the
like
.
Thus
a
swarm
of
*NL*
foolish
novels
and
monstrous
romances
will
be
produced
,
either
to
the
*NL*
great
impoverishing
of
booksellers
,
or
to
the
great
loss
of
time
and
*NL*
depravation
of
morals
in
the
reader
;
nay
,
often
to
the
spreading
of
*NL*
scandal
and
calumny
,
and
to
the
prejudice
of
the
characters
of
many
*NL*
worthy
and
honest
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
question
not
but
the
ingenious
author
of
the
Spectator
was
*NL*
principally
induced
to
prefix
Greek
and
Latin
mottos
to
every
paper
,
*NL*
from
the
same
consideration
of
guarding
against
the
pursuit
of
those
*NL*
scribblers
,
who
having
no
talents
of
a
writer
but
what
is
taught
by
*NL*
the
writing-master
,
are
yet
nowise
afraid
nor
ashamed
to
assume
the
*NL*
same
titles
with
the
greatest
genius
,
than
their
good
brother
in
the
*NL*
fable
was
of
braying
in
the
lion
's
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
device
therefore
of
his
motto
,
it
became
impracticable
for
any
*NL*
man
to
presume
to
imitate
the
Spectators
,
without
understanding
at
*NL*
least
one
sentence
in
the
learned
languages
.
In
the
same
manner
I
have
*NL*
now
secured
myself
from
the
imitation
of
those
who
are
utterly
*NL*
incapable
of
any
degree
of
reflection
,
and
whose
learning
is
not
equal
*NL*
to
an
essay
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
be
here
understood
to
insinuate
,
that
the
greatest
merit
*NL*
of
such
historical
productions
can
ever
lie
in
these
introductory
*NL*
chapters
;
but
,
in
fact
,
those
parts
which
contain
mere
narrative
only
,
*NL*
afford
much
more
encouragement
to
the
pen
of
an
imitator
,
than
those
*NL*
which
are
composed
of
observation
and
reflection
.
Here
I
mean
such
*NL*
imitators
as
Rowe
was
of
Shakespear
,
or
as
Horace
hints
some
of
the
*NL*
Romans
were
of
Cato
,
by
bare
feet
and
sour
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
invent
good
stories
,
and
to
tell
them
well
,
are
possibly
very
rare
*NL*
talents
,
and
yet
I
have
observed
few
persons
who
have
scrupled
to
aim
*NL*
at
both
:
and
if
we
examine
the
romances
and
novels
with
which
the
*NL*
world
abounds
,
I
think
we
may
fairly
conclude
,
that
most
of
the
*NL*
authors
would
not
have
attempted
to
show
their
teeth
-LRB-
if
the
*NL*
expression
may
be
allowed
me
-RRB-
in
any
other
way
of
writing
;
nor
could
*NL*
indeed
have
strung
together
a
dozen
sentences
on
any
other
subject
*NL*
whatever
.

*NL*
*NL*
may
be
more
truly
said
of
the
historian
and
biographer
,
than
of
any
*NL*
other
species
of
writing
;
for
all
the
arts
and
sciences
-LRB-
even
*NL*
criticism
itself
-RRB-
require
some
little
degree
of
learning
and
*NL*
knowledge
.
Poetry
,
indeed
,
may
perhaps
be
thought
an
exception
;
but
*NL*
then
it
demands
numbers
,
or
something
like
numbers
:
whereas
,
to
the
*NL*
composition
of
novels
and
romances
,
nothing
is
necessary
but
paper
,
*NL*
pens
,
and
ink
,
with
the
manual
capacity
of
using
them
.
This
,
I
*NL*
conceive
,
their
productions
show
to
be
the
opinion
of
the
authors
*NL*
themselves
:
and
this
must
be
the
opinion
of
their
readers
,
if
indeed
*NL*
there
be
any
such
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
we
are
to
derive
that
universal
contempt
which
the
world
,
who
*NL*
always
denominate
the
whole
from
the
majority
,
have
cast
on
all
*NL*
historical
writers
who
do
not
draw
their
materials
from
records
.
And
*NL*
it
is
the
apprehension
of
this
contempt
that
hath
made
us
so
*NL*
cautiously
avoid
the
term
romance
,
a
name
with
which
we
might
*NL*
otherwise
have
been
well
enough
contented
.
Though
,
as
we
have
good
*NL*
authority
for
all
our
characters
,
no
less
indeed
than
the
vast
*NL*
authentic
doomsday-book
of
nature
,
as
is
elsewhere
hinted
,
our
labours
*NL*
have
sufficient
title
to
the
name
of
history
.
Certainly
they
deserve
*NL*
some
distinction
from
those
works
,
which
one
of
the
wittiest
of
men
*NL*
regarded
only
as
proceeding
from
a
_
pruritus
_
,
or
indeed
rather
from
a
*NL*
looseness
of
the
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
besides
the
dishonour
which
is
thus
cast
on
one
of
the
most
useful
*NL*
as
well
as
entertaining
of
all
kinds
of
writing
,
there
is
just
reason
*NL*
to
apprehend
,
that
by
encouraging
such
authors
we
shall
propagate
much
*NL*
dishonour
of
another
kind
;
I
mean
to
the
characters
of
many
good
and
*NL*
valuable
members
of
society
;
for
the
dullest
writers
,
no
more
than
the
*NL*
dullest
companions
,
are
always
inoffensive
.
They
have
both
enough
of
*NL*
language
to
be
indecent
and
abusive
.
And
surely
if
the
opinion
just
*NL*
above
cited
be
true
,
we
can
not
wonder
that
works
so
nastily
derived
*NL*
should
be
nasty
themselves
,
or
have
a
tendency
to
make
others
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
prevent
therefore
,
for
the
future
,
such
intemperate
abuses
of
*NL*
leisure
,
of
letters
,
and
of
the
liberty
of
the
press
,
especially
as
*NL*
the
world
seems
at
present
to
be
more
than
usually
threatened
with
*NL*
them
,
I
shall
here
venture
to
mention
some
qualifications
,
every
one
*NL*
of
which
are
in
a
pretty
high
degree
necessary
to
this
order
of
*NL*
historians
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
is
,
genius
,
without
a
full
vein
of
which
no
study
,
says
*NL*
Horace
,
can
avail
us
.
By
genius
I
would
understand
that
power
or
*NL*
rather
those
powers
of
the
mind
,
which
are
capable
of
penetrating
into
*NL*
all
things
within
our
reach
and
knowledge
,
and
of
distinguishing
their
*NL*
essential
differences
.
These
are
no
other
than
invention
and
judgment
;
*NL*
and
they
are
both
called
by
the
collective
name
of
genius
,
as
they
are
*NL*
of
those
gifts
of
nature
which
we
bring
with
us
into
the
world
.
*NL*
Concerning
each
of
which
many
seem
to
have
fallen
into
very
great
*NL*
errors
;
for
by
invention
,
I
believe
,
is
generally
understood
a
*NL*
creative
faculty
,
which
would
indeed
prove
most
romance
writers
to
*NL*
have
the
highest
pretensions
to
it
;
whereas
by
invention
is
really
*NL*
meant
no
more
-LRB-
and
so
the
word
signifies
-RRB-
than
discovery
,
or
finding
*NL*
out
;
or
to
explain
it
at
large
,
a
quick
and
sagacious
penetration
into
*NL*
the
true
essence
of
all
the
objects
of
our
contemplation
.
This
,
I
*NL*
think
,
can
rarely
exist
without
the
concomitancy
of
judgment
;
for
how
*NL*
we
can
be
said
to
have
discovered
the
true
essence
of
two
things
,
*NL*
without
discerning
their
difference
,
seems
to
me
hard
to
conceive
.
Now
*NL*
this
last
is
the
undisputed
province
of
judgment
,
and
yet
some
few
men
*NL*
of
wit
have
agreed
with
all
the
dull
fellows
in
the
world
in
*NL*
representing
these
two
to
have
been
seldom
or
never
the
property
of
*NL*
one
and
the
same
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
they
should
be
so
,
they
are
not
sufficient
for
our
purpose
,
*NL*
without
a
good
share
of
learning
;
for
which
I
could
again
cite
the
*NL*
authority
of
Horace
,
and
of
many
others
,
if
any
was
necessary
to
prove
*NL*
that
tools
are
of
no
service
to
a
workman
,
when
they
are
not
sharpened
*NL*
by
art
,
or
when
he
wants
rules
to
direct
him
in
his
work
,
or
hath
no
*NL*
matter
to
work
upon
.
All
these
uses
are
supplied
by
learning
;
for
*NL*
nature
can
only
furnish
us
with
capacity
;
or
,
as
I
have
chose
to
*NL*
illustrate
it
,
with
the
tools
of
our
profession
;
learning
must
fit
*NL*
them
for
use
,
must
direct
them
in
it
,
and
,
lastly
,
must
contribute
*NL*
part
at
least
of
the
materials
.
A
competent
knowledge
of
history
and
*NL*
of
the
belles-lettres
is
here
absolutely
necessary
;
and
without
this
*NL*
share
of
knowledge
at
least
,
to
affect
the
character
of
an
historian
,
*NL*
is
as
vain
as
to
endeavour
at
building
a
house
without
timber
or
*NL*
mortar
,
or
brick
or
stone
.
Homer
and
Milton
,
who
,
though
they
added
*NL*
the
ornament
of
numbers
to
their
works
,
were
both
historians
of
our
*NL*
order
,
were
masters
of
all
the
learning
of
their
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
there
is
another
sort
of
knowledge
,
beyond
the
power
of
*NL*
learning
to
bestow
,
and
this
is
to
be
had
by
conversation
.
So
*NL*
necessary
is
this
to
the
understanding
the
characters
of
men
,
that
*NL*
none
are
more
ignorant
of
them
than
those
learned
pedants
whose
lives
*NL*
have
been
entirely
consumed
in
colleges
,
and
among
books
;
for
however
*NL*
exquisitely
human
nature
may
have
been
described
by
writers
,
the
true
*NL*
practical
system
can
be
learnt
only
in
the
world
.
Indeed
the
like
*NL*
happens
in
every
other
kind
of
knowledge
.
Neither
physic
nor
law
are
*NL*
to
be
practically
known
from
books
.
Nay
,
the
farmer
,
the
planter
,
the
*NL*
gardener
,
must
perfect
by
experience
what
he
hath
acquired
the
*NL*
rudiments
of
by
reading
.
How
accurately
soever
the
ingenious
Mr
Miller
*NL*
may
have
described
the
plant
,
he
himself
would
advise
his
disciple
to
*NL*
see
it
in
the
garden
.
As
we
must
perceive
,
that
after
the
nicest
*NL*
strokes
of
a
Shakespear
or
a
Jonson
,
of
a
Wycherly
or
an
Otway
,
some
*NL*
touches
of
nature
will
escape
the
reader
,
which
the
judicious
action
*NL*
of
a
Garrick
,
of
a
Cibber
,
or
a
Clive
,
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
can
convey
to
him
;
so
,
on
the
*NL*
real
stage
,
the
character
shows
himself
in
a
stronger
and
bolder
light
*NL*
than
he
can
be
described
.
And
if
this
be
the
case
in
those
fine
and
*NL*
nervous
descriptions
which
great
authors
themselves
have
taken
from
*NL*
life
,
how
much
more
strongly
will
it
hold
when
the
writer
himself
*NL*
takes
his
lines
not
from
nature
,
but
from
books
?
Such
characters
are
*NL*
only
the
faint
copy
of
a
copy
,
and
can
have
neither
the
justness
nor
*NL*
spirit
of
an
original
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
There
is
a
peculiar
propriety
in
mentioning
this
great
actor
,
*NL*
and
these
two
most
justly
celebrated
actresses
,
in
this
place
,
as
*NL*
they
have
all
formed
themselves
on
the
study
of
nature
only
,
and
not
*NL*
on
the
imitation
of
their
predecessors
.
Hence
they
have
been
able
to
*NL*
excel
all
who
have
gone
before
them
;
a
degree
of
merit
which
the
*NL*
servile
herd
of
imitators
can
never
possibly
arrive
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
conversation
in
our
historian
must
be
universal
,
that
is
,
*NL*
with
all
ranks
and
degrees
of
men
;
for
the
knowledge
of
what
is
called
*NL*
high
life
will
not
instruct
him
in
low
;
nor
,
_
e
converso
_
,
will
his
*NL*
being
acquainted
with
the
inferior
part
of
mankind
teach
him
the
*NL*
manners
of
the
superior
.
And
though
it
may
be
thought
that
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
either
may
sufficiently
enable
him
to
describe
at
least
*NL*
that
in
which
he
hath
been
conversant
,
yet
he
will
even
here
fall
*NL*
greatly
short
of
perfection
;
for
the
follies
of
either
rank
do
in
*NL*
reality
illustrate
each
other
.
For
instance
,
the
affectation
of
high
*NL*
life
appears
more
glaring
and
ridiculous
from
the
simplicity
of
the
*NL*
low
;
and
again
,
the
rudeness
and
barbarity
of
this
latter
,
strikes
*NL*
with
much
stronger
ideas
of
absurdity
,
when
contrasted
with
,
and
*NL*
opposed
to
,
the
politeness
which
controuls
the
former
.
Besides
,
to
say
*NL*
the
truth
,
the
manners
of
our
historian
will
be
improved
by
both
these
*NL*
conversations
;
for
in
the
one
he
will
easily
find
examples
of
*NL*
plainness
,
honesty
,
and
sincerity
;
in
the
other
of
refinement
,
*NL*
elegance
,
and
a
liberality
of
spirit
;
which
last
quality
I
myself
have
*NL*
scarce
ever
seen
in
men
of
low
birth
and
education
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
will
all
the
qualities
I
have
hitherto
given
my
historian
avail
*NL*
him
,
unless
he
have
what
is
generally
meant
by
a
good
heart
,
and
be
*NL*
capable
of
feeling
.
The
author
who
will
make
me
weep
,
says
Horace
,
*NL*
must
first
weep
himself
.
In
reality
,
no
man
can
paint
a
distress
well
*NL*
which
he
doth
not
feel
while
he
is
painting
it
;
nor
do
I
doubt
,
but
*NL*
that
the
most
pathetic
and
affecting
scenes
have
been
writ
with
tears
.
*NL*
In
the
same
manner
it
is
with
the
ridiculous
.
I
am
convinced
I
never
*NL*
make
my
reader
laugh
heartily
but
where
I
have
laughed
before
him
;
*NL*
unless
it
should
happen
at
any
time
,
that
instead
of
laughing
with
me
*NL*
he
should
be
inclined
to
laugh
at
me
.
Perhaps
this
may
have
been
the
*NL*
case
at
some
passages
in
this
chapter
,
from
which
apprehension
I
will
*NL*
here
put
an
end
to
it
.

Anglice
_
the
day
began
to
*NL*
break
,
when
Jones
walked
forth
in
company
with
the
stranger
,
and
*NL*
mounted
Mazard
Hill
;
of
which
they
had
no
sooner
gained
the
summit
*NL*
than
one
of
the
most
noble
prospects
in
the
world
presented
itself
to
*NL*
their
view
,
and
which
we
would
likewise
present
to
the
reader
,
but
for
*NL*
two
reasons
:
first
,
we
despair
of
making
those
who
have
seen
this
*NL*
prospect
admire
our
description
;
secondly
,
we
very
much
doubt
whether
*NL*
those
who
have
not
seen
it
would
understand
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
stood
for
some
minutes
fixed
in
one
posture
,
and
directing
his
*NL*
eyes
towards
the
south
;
upon
which
the
old
gentleman
asked
,
What
he
*NL*
was
looking
at
with
so
much
attention
?
``
Alas
!
sir
,
''
answered
he
with
a
*NL*
sigh
,
``
I
was
endeavouring
to
trace
out
my
own
journey
hither
.
Good
*NL*
heavens
!
what
a
distance
is
Gloucester
from
us
!
What
a
vast
track
of
*NL*
land
must
be
between
me
and
my
own
home
!
''
--
``
Ay
,
ay
,
young
gentleman
,
''
*NL*
cries
the
other
,
``
and
by
your
sighing
,
from
what
you
love
better
than
*NL*
your
own
home
,
or
I
am
mistaken
.
I
perceive
now
the
object
of
your
*NL*
contemplation
is
not
within
your
sight
,
and
yet
I
fancy
you
have
a
*NL*
pleasure
in
looking
that
way
.
''
Jones
answered
with
a
smile
,
``
I
find
,
*NL*
old
friend
,
you
have
not
yet
forgot
the
sensations
of
your
youth
.
I
*NL*
own
my
thoughts
were
employed
as
you
have
guessed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
walked
to
that
part
of
the
hill
which
looks
to
the
*NL*
north-west
,
and
which
hangs
over
a
vast
and
extensive
wood
.
Here
they
*NL*
were
no
sooner
arrived
than
they
heard
at
a
distance
the
most
violent
*NL*
screams
of
a
woman
,
proceeding
from
the
wood
below
them
.
Jones
*NL*
listened
a
moment
,
and
then
,
without
saying
a
word
to
his
companion
*NL*
-LRB-
for
indeed
the
occasion
seemed
sufficiently
pressing
-RRB-
,
ran
,
or
rather
*NL*
slid
,
down
the
hill
,
and
,
without
the
least
apprehension
or
concern
*NL*
for
his
own
safety
,
made
directly
to
the
thicket
,
whence
the
sound
had
*NL*
issued
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
entered
far
into
the
wood
before
he
beheld
a
most
shocking
*NL*
sight
indeed
,
a
woman
stript
half
naked
,
under
the
hands
of
a
ruffian
,
*NL*
who
had
put
his
garter
round
her
neck
,
and
was
endeavouring
to
draw
*NL*
her
up
to
a
tree
.
Jones
asked
no
questions
at
this
interval
,
but
fell
*NL*
instantly
upon
the
villain
,
and
made
such
good
use
of
his
trusty
oaken
*NL*
stick
that
he
laid
him
sprawling
on
the
ground
before
he
could
defend
*NL*
himself
,
indeed
almost
before
he
knew
he
was
attacked
;
nor
did
he
*NL*
cease
the
prosecution
of
his
blows
till
the
woman
herself
begged
him
*NL*
to
forbear
,
saying
,
she
believed
he
had
sufficiently
done
his
*NL*
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
wretch
then
fell
upon
her
knees
to
Jones
,
and
gave
him
a
*NL*
thousand
thanks
for
her
deliverance
.
He
presently
lifted
her
up
,
and
*NL*
told
her
he
was
highly
pleased
with
the
extraordinary
accident
which
*NL*
had
sent
him
thither
for
her
relief
,
where
it
was
so
improbable
she
*NL*
should
find
any
;
adding
,
that
Heaven
seemed
to
have
designed
him
as
*NL*
the
happy
instrument
of
her
protection
.
``
Nay
,
''
answered
she
,
``
I
could
*NL*
almost
conceive
you
to
be
some
good
angel
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
you
*NL*
look
more
like
an
angel
than
a
man
in
my
eye
.
''
Indeed
he
was
a
*NL*
charming
figure
;
and
if
a
very
fine
person
,
and
a
most
comely
set
of
*NL*
features
,
adorned
with
youth
,
health
,
strength
,
freshness
,
spirit
,
and
*NL*
good-nature
,
can
make
a
man
resemble
an
angel
,
he
certainly
had
that
*NL*
resemblance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
redeemed
captive
had
not
altogether
so
much
of
the
human-angelic
*NL*
species
:
she
seemed
to
be
at
least
of
the
middle
age
,
nor
had
her
face
*NL*
much
appearance
of
beauty
;
but
her
cloaths
being
torn
from
all
the
*NL*
upper
part
of
her
body
,
her
breasts
,
which
were
well
formed
and
*NL*
extremely
white
,
attracted
the
eyes
of
her
deliverer
,
and
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
they
stood
silent
,
and
gazing
at
each
other
;
till
the
ruffian
*NL*
on
the
ground
beginning
to
move
,
Jones
took
the
garter
which
had
been
*NL*
intended
for
another
purpose
,
and
bound
both
his
hands
behind
him
.
And
*NL*
now
,
on
contemplating
his
face
,
he
discovered
,
greatly
to
his
*NL*
surprize
,
and
perhaps
not
a
little
to
his
satisfaction
,
this
very
*NL*
person
to
be
no
other
than
ensign
Northerton
.
Nor
had
the
ensign
*NL*
forgotten
his
former
antagonist
,
whom
he
knew
the
moment
he
came
to
*NL*
himself
.
His
surprize
was
equal
to
that
of
Jones
;
but
I
conceive
his
*NL*
pleasure
was
rather
less
on
this
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
helped
Northerton
upon
his
legs
,
and
then
looking
him
stedfastly
*NL*
in
the
face
,
``
I
fancy
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
did
not
expect
to
meet
me
*NL*
any
more
in
this
world
,
and
I
confess
I
had
as
little
expectation
to
*NL*
find
you
here
.
However
,
fortune
,
I
see
,
hath
brought
us
once
more
*NL*
together
,
and
hath
given
me
satisfaction
for
the
injury
I
have
*NL*
received
,
even
without
my
own
knowledge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
much
like
a
man
of
honour
,
indeed
,
''
answered
Northerton
,
*NL*
``
to
take
satisfaction
by
knocking
a
man
down
behind
his
back
.
Neither
*NL*
am
I
capable
of
giving
you
satisfaction
here
,
as
I
have
no
sword
;
but
*NL*
if
you
dare
behave
like
a
gentleman
,
let
us
go
where
I
can
furnish
*NL*
myself
with
one
,
and
I
will
do
by
you
as
a
man
of
honour
ought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doth
it
become
such
a
villain
as
you
are
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
to
*NL*
contaminate
the
name
of
honour
by
assuming
it
?
But
I
shall
waste
no
*NL*
time
in
discourse
with
you
.
Justice
requires
satisfaction
of
you
now
,
*NL*
and
shall
have
it
.
''
Then
turning
to
the
woman
,
he
asked
her
,
if
she
*NL*
was
near
her
home
;
or
if
not
,
whether
she
was
acquainted
with
any
*NL*
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
where
she
might
procure
herself
some
*NL*
decent
cloaths
,
in
order
to
proceed
to
a
justice
of
the
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
answered
she
was
an
entire
stranger
in
that
part
of
the
world
.
*NL*
Jones
then
recollecting
himself
,
said
,
he
had
a
friend
near
who
would
*NL*
direct
them
;
indeed
,
he
wondered
at
his
not
following
;
but
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
the
good
Man
of
the
Hill
,
when
our
heroe
departed
,
sat
himself
down
on
*NL*
the
brow
,
where
,
though
he
had
a
gun
in
his
hand
,
he
with
great
*NL*
patience
and
unconcern
had
attended
the
issue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
then
stepping
without
the
wood
,
perceived
the
old
man
sitting
as
*NL*
we
have
just
described
him
;
he
presently
exerted
his
utmost
agility
,
*NL*
and
with
surprizing
expedition
ascended
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
advised
him
to
carry
the
woman
to
Upton
,
which
,
he
said
,
*NL*
was
the
nearest
town
,
and
there
he
would
be
sure
of
furnishing
her
*NL*
with
all
manner
of
conveniencies
.
Jones
having
received
his
direction
*NL*
to
the
place
,
took
his
leave
of
the
Man
of
the
Hill
,
and
,
desiring
him
*NL*
to
direct
Partridge
the
same
way
,
returned
hastily
to
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
heroe
,
at
his
departure
to
make
this
enquiry
of
his
friend
,
had
*NL*
considered
,
that
as
the
ruffian
's
hands
were
tied
behind
him
,
he
was
*NL*
incapable
of
executing
any
wicked
purposes
on
the
poor
woman
.
Besides
,
*NL*
he
knew
he
should
not
be
beyond
the
reach
of
her
voice
,
and
could
*NL*
return
soon
enough
to
prevent
any
mischief
.
He
had
moreover
declared
*NL*
to
the
villain
,
that
if
he
attempted
the
least
insult
,
he
would
be
*NL*
himself
immediately
the
executioner
of
vengeance
on
him
.
But
Jones
*NL*
unluckily
forgot
,
that
though
the
hands
of
Northerton
were
tied
,
his
*NL*
legs
were
at
liberty
;
nor
did
he
lay
the
least
injunction
on
the
*NL*
prisoner
that
he
should
not
make
what
use
of
these
he
pleased
.
*NL*
Northerton
therefore
having
given
no
parole
of
that
kind
,
thought
he
*NL*
might
without
any
breach
of
honour
depart
;
not
being
obliged
,
as
he
*NL*
imagined
,
by
any
rules
,
to
wait
for
a
formal
discharge
.
He
therefore
*NL*
took
up
his
legs
,
which
were
at
liberty
,
and
walked
off
through
the
*NL*
wood
,
which
favoured
his
retreat
;
nor
did
the
woman
,
whose
eyes
were
*NL*
perhaps
rather
turned
toward
her
deliverer
,
once
think
of
his
escape
,
*NL*
or
give
herself
any
concern
or
trouble
to
prevent
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
therefore
,
at
his
return
,
found
the
woman
alone
.
He
would
have
*NL*
spent
some
time
in
searching
for
Northerton
,
but
she
would
not
permit
*NL*
him
;
earnestly
entreating
that
he
would
accompany
her
to
the
town
*NL*
whither
they
had
been
directed
.
``
As
to
the
fellow
's
escape
,
''
said
she
,
*NL*
``
it
gives
me
no
uneasiness
;
for
philosophy
and
Christianity
both
*NL*
preach
up
forgiveness
of
injuries
.
But
for
you
,
sir
,
I
am
concerned
at
*NL*
the
trouble
I
give
you
;
nay
,
indeed
,
my
nakedness
may
well
make
me
*NL*
ashamed
to
look
you
in
the
face
;
and
if
it
was
not
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
your
protection
,
I
should
wish
to
go
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
offered
her
his
coat
;
but
,
I
know
not
for
what
reason
,
she
*NL*
absolutely
refused
the
most
earnest
solicitations
to
accept
it
.
He
*NL*
then
begged
her
to
forget
both
the
causes
of
her
confusion
.
``
With
*NL*
regard
to
the
former
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
have
done
no
more
than
my
duty
in
*NL*
protecting
you
;
and
as
for
the
latter
,
I
will
entirely
remove
it
,
by
*NL*
walking
before
you
all
the
way
;
for
I
would
not
have
my
eyes
offend
*NL*
you
,
and
I
could
not
answer
for
my
power
of
resisting
the
attractive
*NL*
charms
of
so
much
beauty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
our
heroe
and
the
redeemed
lady
walked
in
the
same
manner
as
*NL*
Orpheus
and
Eurydice
marched
heretofore
;
but
though
I
can
not
believe
*NL*
that
Jones
was
designedly
tempted
by
his
fair
one
to
look
behind
him
,
*NL*
yet
as
she
frequently
wanted
his
assistance
to
help
her
over
stiles
,
*NL*
and
had
besides
many
trips
and
other
accidents
,
he
was
often
obliged
*NL*
to
turn
about
.
However
,
he
had
better
fortune
than
what
attended
poor
*NL*
Orpheus
,
for
he
brought
his
companion
,
or
rather
follower
,
safe
into
*NL*
the
famous
town
of
Upton
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrival
of
Mr
Jones
with
his
lady
at
the
inn
;
with
a
very
full
*NL*
description
of
the
battle
of
Upton
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
reader
,
we
doubt
not
,
is
very
eager
to
know
who
this
lady
*NL*
was
,
and
how
she
fell
into
the
hands
of
Mr
Northerton
,
we
must
beg
him
*NL*
to
suspend
his
curiosity
for
a
short
time
,
as
we
are
obliged
,
for
some
*NL*
very
good
reasons
which
hereafter
perhaps
he
may
guess
,
to
delay
his
*NL*
satisfaction
a
little
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
and
his
fair
companion
no
sooner
entered
the
town
,
than
they
*NL*
went
directly
to
that
inn
which
in
their
eyes
presented
the
fairest
*NL*
appearance
to
the
street
.
Here
Jones
,
having
ordered
a
servant
to
show
*NL*
a
room
above
stairs
,
was
ascending
,
when
the
dishevelled
fair
,
hastily
*NL*
following
,
was
laid
hold
on
by
the
master
of
the
house
,
who
cried
,
*NL*
``
Heyday
,
where
is
that
beggar
wench
going
?
Stay
below
stairs
,
I
desire
*NL*
you
.
''
But
Jones
at
that
instant
thundered
from
above
,
``
Let
the
lady
*NL*
come
up
,
''
in
so
authoritative
a
voice
,
that
the
good
man
instantly
*NL*
withdrew
his
hands
,
and
the
lady
made
the
best
of
her
way
to
the
*NL*
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Jones
wished
her
joy
of
her
safe
arrival
,
and
then
departed
,
in
*NL*
order
,
as
he
promised
,
to
send
the
landlady
up
with
some
cloaths
.
The
*NL*
poor
woman
thanked
him
heartily
for
all
his
kindness
,
and
said
,
she
*NL*
hoped
she
should
see
him
again
soon
,
to
thank
him
a
thousand
times
*NL*
more
.
During
this
short
conversation
,
she
covered
her
white
bosom
as
*NL*
well
as
she
could
possibly
with
her
arms
;
for
Jones
could
not
avoid
*NL*
stealing
a
sly
peep
or
two
,
though
he
took
all
imaginable
care
to
*NL*
avoid
giving
any
offence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
travellers
had
happened
to
take
up
their
residence
at
a
house
of
*NL*
exceeding
good
repute
,
whither
Irish
ladies
of
strict
virtue
,
and
many
*NL*
northern
lasses
of
the
same
predicament
,
were
accustomed
to
resort
in
*NL*
their
way
to
Bath
.
The
landlady
therefore
would
by
no
means
have
*NL*
admitted
any
conversation
of
a
disreputable
kind
to
pass
under
her
*NL*
roof
.
Indeed
,
so
foul
and
contagious
are
all
such
proceedings
,
that
*NL*
they
contaminate
the
very
innocent
scenes
where
they
are
committed
,
*NL*
and
give
the
name
of
a
bad
house
,
or
of
a
house
of
ill
repute
,
to
all
*NL*
those
where
they
are
suffered
to
be
carried
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
that
I
would
intimate
that
such
strict
chastity
as
was
preserved
*NL*
in
the
temple
of
Vesta
can
possibly
be
maintained
at
a
public
inn
.
My
*NL*
good
landlady
did
not
hope
for
such
a
blessing
,
nor
would
any
of
the
*NL*
ladies
I
have
spoken
of
,
or
indeed
any
others
of
the
most
rigid
note
,
*NL*
have
expected
or
insisted
on
any
such
thing
.
But
to
exclude
all
vulgar
*NL*
concubinage
,
and
to
drive
all
whores
in
rags
from
within
the
walls
,
is
*NL*
within
the
power
of
every
one
.
This
my
landlady
very
strictly
adhered
*NL*
to
,
and
this
her
virtuous
guests
,
who
did
not
travel
in
rags
,
would
*NL*
very
reasonably
have
expected
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
required
no
very
blameable
degree
of
suspicion
to
imagine
that
*NL*
Mr
Jones
and
his
ragged
companion
had
certain
purposes
in
their
*NL*
intention
,
which
,
though
tolerated
in
some
Christian
countries
,
*NL*
connived
at
in
others
,
and
practised
in
all
,
are
however
as
expressly
*NL*
forbidden
as
murder
,
or
any
other
horrid
vice
,
by
that
religion
which
*NL*
is
universally
believed
in
those
countries
.
The
landlady
,
therefore
,
*NL*
had
no
sooner
received
an
intimation
of
the
entrance
of
the
above-said
*NL*
persons
than
she
began
to
meditate
the
most
expeditious
means
for
*NL*
their
expulsion
.
In
order
to
this
,
she
had
provided
herself
with
a
*NL*
long
and
deadly
instrument
,
with
which
,
in
times
of
peace
,
the
*NL*
chambermaid
was
wont
to
demolish
the
labours
of
the
industrious
*NL*
spider
.
In
vulgar
phrase
,
she
had
taken
up
the
broomstick
,
and
was
*NL*
just
about
to
sally
from
the
kitchen
,
when
Jones
accosted
her
with
a
*NL*
demand
of
a
gown
and
other
vestments
,
to
cover
the
half-naked
woman
*NL*
upstairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
can
be
more
provoking
to
the
human
temper
,
nor
more
dangerous
*NL*
to
that
cardinal
virtue
,
patience
,
than
solicitations
of
extraordinary
*NL*
offices
of
kindness
on
behalf
of
those
very
persons
with
whom
we
are
*NL*
highly
incensed
.
For
this
reason
Shakespear
hath
artfully
introduced
*NL*
his
Desdemona
soliciting
favours
for
Cassio
of
her
husband
,
as
the
*NL*
means
of
inflaming
,
not
only
his
jealousy
,
but
his
rage
,
to
the
*NL*
highest
pitch
of
madness
;
and
we
find
the
unfortunate
Moor
less
able
*NL*
to
command
his
passion
on
this
occasion
,
than
even
when
he
beheld
his
*NL*
valued
present
to
his
wife
in
the
hands
of
his
supposed
rival
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
we
regard
these
efforts
as
insults
on
our
understanding
,
and
to
*NL*
such
the
pride
of
man
is
very
difficultly
brought
to
submit
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
landlady
,
though
a
very
good-tempered
woman
,
had
,
I
suppose
,
some
*NL*
of
this
pride
in
her
composition
,
for
Jones
had
scarce
ended
his
*NL*
request
,
when
she
fell
upon
him
with
a
certain
weapon
,
which
,
though
*NL*
it
be
neither
long
,
nor
sharp
,
nor
hard
,
nor
indeed
threatens
from
its
*NL*
appearance
with
either
death
or
wound
,
hath
been
however
held
in
great
*NL*
dread
and
abhorrence
by
many
wise
men
--
nay
,
by
many
brave
ones
;
*NL*
insomuch
,
that
some
who
have
dared
to
look
into
the
mouth
of
a
loaded
*NL*
cannon
,
have
not
dared
to
look
into
a
mouth
where
this
weapon
was
*NL*
brandished
;
and
rather
than
run
the
hazard
of
its
execution
,
have
*NL*
contented
themselves
with
making
a
most
pitiful
and
sneaking
figure
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
all
their
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
confess
the
truth
,
I
am
afraid
Mr
Jones
was
one
of
these
;
for
*NL*
though
he
was
attacked
and
violently
belaboured
with
the
aforesaid
*NL*
weapon
,
he
could
not
be
provoked
to
make
any
resistance
;
but
in
a
most
*NL*
cowardly
manner
applied
,
with
many
entreaties
,
to
his
antagonist
to
*NL*
desist
from
pursuing
her
blows
;
in
plain
English
,
he
only
begged
her
*NL*
with
the
utmost
earnestness
to
hear
him
;
but
before
he
could
obtain
*NL*
his
request
,
my
landlord
himself
entered
into
the
fray
,
and
embraced
*NL*
that
side
of
the
cause
which
seemed
to
stand
very
little
in
need
of
*NL*
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
a
sort
of
heroes
who
are
supposed
to
be
determined
in
their
*NL*
chusing
or
avoiding
a
conflict
by
the
character
and
behaviour
of
the
*NL*
person
whom
they
are
to
engage
.
These
are
said
to
know
their
men
,
and
*NL*
Jones
,
I
believe
,
knew
his
woman
;
for
though
he
had
been
so
submissive
*NL*
to
her
,
he
was
no
sooner
attacked
by
her
husband
,
than
he
demonstrated
*NL*
an
immediate
spirit
of
resentment
,
and
enjoined
him
silence
under
a
*NL*
very
severe
penalty
;
no
less
than
that
,
I
think
,
of
being
converted
*NL*
into
fuel
for
his
own
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
husband
,
with
great
indignation
,
but
with
a
mixture
of
pity
,
*NL*
answered
,
``
You
must
pray
first
to
be
made
able
.
I
believe
I
am
a
*NL*
better
man
than
yourself
;
ay
,
every
way
,
that
I
am
;
''
and
presently
*NL*
proceeded
to
discharge
half-a-dozen
whores
at
the
lady
above
stairs
,
*NL*
the
last
of
which
had
scarce
issued
from
his
lips
,
when
a
swinging
*NL*
blow
from
the
cudgel
that
Jones
carried
in
his
hand
assaulted
him
over
*NL*
the
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
question
whether
the
landlord
or
the
landlady
was
the
most
*NL*
expeditious
in
returning
this
blow
.
My
landlord
,
whose
hands
were
*NL*
empty
,
fell
to
with
his
fist
,
and
the
good
wife
,
uplifting
her
broom
*NL*
and
aiming
at
the
head
of
Jones
,
had
probably
put
an
immediate
end
to
*NL*
the
fray
,
and
to
Jones
likewise
,
had
not
the
descent
of
this
broom
*NL*
been
prevented
--
not
by
the
miraculous
intervention
of
any
heathen
*NL*
deity
,
but
by
a
very
natural
though
fortunate
accident
,
viz.
,
by
the
*NL*
arrival
of
Partridge
;
who
entered
the
house
at
that
instant
-LRB-
for
fear
*NL*
had
caused
him
to
run
every
step
from
the
hill
-RRB-
,
and
who
,
seeing
the
*NL*
danger
which
threatened
his
master
or
companion
-LRB-
which
you
chuse
to
*NL*
call
him
-RRB-
,
prevented
so
sad
a
catastrophe
,
by
catching
hold
of
the
*NL*
landlady
's
arm
,
as
it
was
brandished
aloft
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
soon
perceived
the
impediment
which
prevented
her
blow
;
*NL*
and
being
unable
to
rescue
her
arm
from
the
hands
of
Partridge
,
she
*NL*
let
fall
the
broom
;
and
then
leaving
Jones
to
the
discipline
of
her
*NL*
husband
,
she
fell
with
the
utmost
fury
on
that
poor
fellow
,
who
had
*NL*
already
given
some
intimation
of
himself
,
by
crying
,
``
Zounds
!
do
you
*NL*
intend
to
kill
my
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
,
though
not
much
addicted
to
battle
,
would
not
however
stand
*NL*
still
when
his
friend
was
attacked
;
nor
was
he
much
displeased
with
*NL*
that
part
of
the
combat
which
fell
to
his
share
;
he
therefore
returned
*NL*
my
landlady
's
blows
as
soon
as
he
received
them
:
and
now
the
fight
was
*NL*
obstinately
maintained
on
all
parts
,
and
it
seemed
doubtful
to
which
*NL*
side
Fortune
would
incline
,
when
the
naked
lady
,
who
had
listened
at
*NL*
the
top
of
the
stairs
to
the
dialogue
which
preceded
the
engagement
,
*NL*
descended
suddenly
from
above
,
and
without
weighing
the
unfair
*NL*
inequality
of
two
to
one
,
fell
upon
the
poor
woman
who
was
boxing
with
*NL*
Partridge
;
nor
did
that
great
champion
desist
,
but
rather
redoubled
*NL*
his
fury
,
when
he
found
fresh
succours
were
arrived
to
his
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Victory
must
now
have
fallen
to
the
side
of
the
travellers
-LRB-
for
the
*NL*
bravest
troops
must
yield
to
numbers
-RRB-
had
not
Susan
the
chambermaid
*NL*
come
luckily
to
support
her
mistress
.
This
Susan
was
as
two-handed
a
*NL*
wench
-LRB-
according
to
the
phrase
-RRB-
as
any
in
the
country
,
and
would
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
have
beat
the
famed
Thalestris
herself
,
or
any
of
her
subject
*NL*
Amazons
;
for
her
form
was
robust
and
man-like
,
and
every
way
made
for
*NL*
such
encounters
.
As
her
hands
and
arms
were
formed
to
give
blows
with
*NL*
great
mischief
to
an
enemy
,
so
was
her
face
as
well
contrived
to
*NL*
receive
blows
without
any
great
injury
to
herself
,
her
nose
being
*NL*
already
flat
to
her
face
;
her
lips
were
so
large
,
that
no
swelling
*NL*
could
be
perceived
in
them
,
and
moreover
they
were
so
hard
,
that
a
*NL*
fist
could
hardly
make
any
impression
on
them
.
Lastly
,
her
cheek-bones
*NL*
stood
out
,
as
if
nature
had
intended
them
for
two
bastions
to
defend
*NL*
her
eyes
in
those
encounters
for
which
she
seemed
so
well
calculated
,
*NL*
and
to
which
she
was
most
wonderfully
well
inclined
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
fair
creature
entering
the
field
of
battle
,
immediately
filed
to
*NL*
that
wing
where
her
mistress
maintained
so
unequal
a
fight
with
one
of
*NL*
either
sex
.
Here
she
presently
challenged
Partridge
to
single
combat
.
*NL*
He
accepted
the
challenge
,
and
a
most
desperate
fight
began
between
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
dogs
of
war
being
let
loose
,
began
to
lick
their
bloody
lips
;
*NL*
now
Victory
,
with
golden
wings
,
hung
hovering
in
the
air
;
now
Fortune
,
*NL*
taking
her
scales
from
her
shelf
,
began
to
weigh
the
fates
of
Tom
*NL*
Jones
,
his
female
companion
,
and
Partridge
,
against
the
landlord
,
his
*NL*
wife
,
and
maid
;
all
which
hung
in
exact
balance
before
her
;
when
a
*NL*
good-natured
accident
put
suddenly
an
end
to
the
bloody
fray
,
with
*NL*
which
half
of
the
combatants
had
already
sufficiently
feasted
.
This
*NL*
accident
was
the
arrival
of
a
coach
and
four
;
upon
which
my
landlord
*NL*
and
landlady
immediately
desisted
from
fighting
,
and
at
their
entreaty
*NL*
obtained
the
same
favour
of
their
antagonists
:
but
Susan
was
not
so
*NL*
kind
to
Partridge
;
for
that
Amazonian
fair
having
overthrown
and
*NL*
bestrid
her
enemy
,
was
now
cuffing
him
lustily
with
both
her
hands
,
*NL*
without
any
regard
to
his
request
of
a
cessation
of
arms
,
or
to
those
*NL*
loud
exclamations
of
murder
which
he
roared
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
,
however
,
had
Jones
quitted
the
landlord
,
than
he
flew
to
*NL*
the
rescue
of
his
defeated
companion
,
from
whom
he
with
much
*NL*
difficulty
drew
off
the
enraged
chambermaid
:
but
Partridge
was
not
*NL*
immediately
sensible
of
his
deliverance
,
for
he
still
lay
flat
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
guarding
his
face
with
his
hands
;
nor
did
he
cease
roaring
till
*NL*
Jones
had
forced
him
to
look
up
,
and
to
perceive
that
the
battle
was
*NL*
at
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
,
who
had
no
visible
hurt
,
and
the
landlady
,
hiding
her
*NL*
well-scratched
face
with
her
handkerchief
,
ran
both
hastily
to
the
*NL*
door
to
attend
the
coach
,
from
which
a
young
lady
and
her
maid
now
*NL*
alighted
.
These
the
landlady
presently
ushered
into
that
room
where
Mr
*NL*
Jones
had
at
first
deposited
his
fair
prize
,
as
it
was
the
best
*NL*
apartment
in
the
house
.
Hither
they
were
obliged
to
pass
through
the
*NL*
field
of
battle
,
which
they
did
with
the
utmost
haste
,
covering
their
*NL*
faces
with
their
handkerchiefs
,
as
desirous
to
avoid
the
notice
of
any
*NL*
one
.
Indeed
their
caution
was
quite
unnecessary
;
for
the
poor
*NL*
unfortunate
Helen
,
the
fatal
cause
of
all
the
bloodshed
,
was
entirely
*NL*
taken
up
in
endeavouring
to
conceal
her
own
face
,
and
Jones
was
no
*NL*
less
occupied
in
rescuing
Partridge
from
the
fury
of
Susan
;
which
*NL*
being
happily
effected
,
the
poor
fellow
immediately
departed
to
the
*NL*
pump
to
wash
his
face
,
and
to
stop
that
bloody
torrent
which
Susan
had
*NL*
plentifully
set
a-flowing
from
his
nostrils
.

Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
the
arrival
of
a
man
of
war
puts
a
final
end
to
hostilities
,
*NL*
and
causes
the
conclusion
of
a
firm
and
lasting
peace
between
all
*NL*
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
serjeant
and
a
file
of
musqueteers
,
with
a
deserter
in
their
*NL*
custody
,
arrived
about
this
time
.
The
serjeant
presently
enquired
for
*NL*
the
principal
magistrate
of
the
town
,
and
was
informed
by
my
landlord
,
*NL*
that
he
himself
was
vested
in
that
office
.
He
then
demanded
his
*NL*
billets
,
together
with
a
mug
of
beer
,
and
complaining
it
was
cold
,
*NL*
spread
himself
before
the
kitchen
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
was
at
this
time
comforting
the
poor
distressed
lady
,
who
sat
*NL*
down
at
a
table
in
the
kitchen
,
and
leaning
her
head
upon
her
arm
,
was
*NL*
bemoaning
her
misfortunes
;
but
lest
my
fair
readers
should
be
in
pain
*NL*
concerning
a
particular
circumstance
,
I
think
proper
here
to
acquaint
*NL*
them
,
that
before
she
had
quitted
the
room
above
stairs
,
she
had
so
*NL*
well
covered
herself
with
a
pillowbeer
which
she
there
found
,
that
her
*NL*
regard
to
decency
was
not
in
the
least
violated
by
the
presence
of
so
*NL*
many
men
as
were
now
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
soldiers
now
went
up
to
the
serjeant
,
and
whispered
*NL*
something
in
his
ear
;
upon
which
he
stedfastly
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
*NL*
lady
,
and
having
looked
at
her
for
near
a
minute
,
he
came
up
to
her
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
I
ask
pardon
,
madam
;
but
I
am
certain
I
am
not
deceived
;
you
*NL*
can
be
no
other
person
than
Captain
Waters
's
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
woman
,
who
in
her
present
distress
had
very
little
regarded
*NL*
the
face
of
any
person
present
,
no
sooner
looked
at
the
serjeant
than
*NL*
she
presently
recollected
him
,
and
calling
him
by
his
name
,
answered
,
*NL*
``
That
she
was
indeed
the
unhappy
person
he
imagined
her
to
be
;
''
but
*NL*
added
,
``
I
wonder
any
one
should
know
me
in
this
disguise
.
''
To
which
*NL*
the
serjeant
replied
,
``
He
was
very
much
surprized
to
see
her
ladyship
*NL*
in
such
a
dress
,
and
was
afraid
some
accident
had
happened
to
*NL*
her
.
''
--
``
An
accident
hath
happened
to
me
,
indeed
,
''
says
she
,
``
and
I
am
*NL*
highly
obliged
to
this
gentleman
''
-LRB-
pointing
to
Jones
-RRB-
``
that
it
was
not
*NL*
a
fatal
one
,
or
that
I
am
now
living
to
mention
it
.
''
--
``
Whatever
the
*NL*
gentleman
hath
done
,
''
cries
the
serjeant
,
``
I
am
sure
the
captain
will
*NL*
make
him
amends
for
it
;
and
if
I
can
be
of
any
service
,
your
ladyship
*NL*
may
command
me
,
and
I
shall
think
myself
very
happy
to
have
it
in
my
*NL*
power
to
serve
your
ladyship
;
and
so
indeed
may
any
one
,
for
I
know
*NL*
the
captain
will
well
reward
them
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
,
who
heard
from
the
stairs
all
that
past
between
the
*NL*
serjeant
and
Mrs
Waters
,
came
hastily
down
,
and
running
directly
up
to
*NL*
her
,
began
to
ask
pardon
for
the
offences
she
had
committed
,
begging
*NL*
that
all
might
be
imputed
to
ignorance
of
her
quality
:
for
,
``
Lud
!
*NL*
madam
,
''
says
she
,
``
how
should
I
have
imagined
that
a
lady
of
your
*NL*
fashion
would
appear
in
such
a
dress
?
I
am
sure
,
madam
,
if
I
had
once
*NL*
suspected
that
your
ladyship
was
your
ladyship
,
I
would
sooner
have
*NL*
burnt
my
tongue
out
,
than
have
said
what
I
have
said
;
and
I
hope
your
*NL*
ladyship
will
accept
of
a
gown
,
till
you
can
get
your
own
cloaths
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prithee
,
woman
,
''
says
Mrs
Waters
,
``
cease
your
impertinence
:
how
can
*NL*
you
imagine
I
should
concern
myself
about
anything
which
comes
from
*NL*
the
lips
of
such
low
creatures
as
yourself
?
But
I
am
surprized
at
your
*NL*
assurance
in
thinking
,
after
what
is
past
,
that
I
will
condescend
to
*NL*
put
on
any
of
your
dirty
things
.
I
would
have
you
know
,
creature
,
I
*NL*
have
a
spirit
above
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Jones
interfered
,
and
begged
Mrs
Waters
to
forgive
the
landlady
,
*NL*
and
to
accept
her
gown
:
``
for
I
must
confess
,
''
cries
he
,
``
our
*NL*
appearance
was
a
little
suspicious
when
first
we
came
in
;
and
I
am
*NL*
well
assured
all
this
good
woman
did
was
,
as
she
professed
,
out
of
*NL*
regard
to
the
reputation
of
her
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
upon
my
truly
was
it
,
''
says
she
:
``
the
gentleman
speaks
very
much
*NL*
like
a
gentleman
,
and
I
see
very
plainly
is
so
;
and
to
be
certain
the
*NL*
house
is
well
known
to
be
a
house
of
as
good
reputation
as
any
on
the
*NL*
road
,
and
though
I
say
it
,
is
frequented
by
gentry
of
the
best
*NL*
quality
,
both
Irish
and
English
.
I
defy
anybody
to
say
black
is
my
*NL*
eye
,
for
that
matter
.
And
,
as
I
was
saying
,
if
I
had
known
your
*NL*
ladyship
to
be
your
ladyship
,
I
would
as
soon
have
burnt
my
fingers
as
*NL*
have
affronted
your
ladyship
;
but
truly
where
gentry
come
and
spend
*NL*
their
money
,
I
am
not
willing
that
they
should
be
scandalized
by
a
set
*NL*
of
poor
shabby
vermin
,
that
,
wherever
they
go
,
leave
more
lice
than
*NL*
money
behind
them
;
such
folks
never
raise
my
compassion
,
for
to
be
*NL*
certain
it
is
foolish
to
have
any
for
them
;
and
if
our
justices
did
as
*NL*
they
ought
,
they
would
be
all
whipt
out
of
the
kingdom
,
for
to
be
*NL*
certain
it
is
what
is
most
fitting
for
them
.
But
as
for
your
ladyship
,
*NL*
I
am
heartily
sorry
your
ladyship
hath
had
a
misfortune
,
and
if
your
*NL*
ladyship
will
do
me
the
honour
to
wear
my
cloaths
till
you
can
get
*NL*
some
of
your
ladyship
's
own
,
to
be
certain
the
best
I
have
is
at
your
*NL*
ladyship
's
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
cold
,
shame
,
or
the
persuasions
of
Mr
Jones
prevailed
most
on
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
,
I
will
not
determine
,
but
she
suffered
herself
to
be
*NL*
pacified
by
this
speech
of
my
landlady
,
and
retired
with
that
good
*NL*
woman
,
in
order
to
apparel
herself
in
a
decent
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
landlord
was
likewise
beginning
his
oration
to
Jones
,
but
was
*NL*
presently
interrupted
by
that
generous
youth
,
who
shook
him
heartily
*NL*
by
the
hand
,
and
assured
him
of
entire
forgiveness
,
saying
,
``
If
you
*NL*
are
satisfied
,
my
worthy
friend
,
I
promise
you
I
am
;
''
and
indeed
,
in
*NL*
one
sense
,
the
landlord
had
the
better
reason
to
be
satisfied
;
for
he
*NL*
had
received
a
bellyfull
of
drubbing
,
whereas
Jones
had
scarce
felt
a
*NL*
single
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
,
who
had
been
all
this
time
washing
his
bloody
nose
at
the
*NL*
pump
,
returned
into
the
kitchen
at
the
instant
when
his
master
and
the
*NL*
landlord
were
shaking
hands
with
each
other
.
As
he
was
of
a
peaceable
*NL*
disposition
,
he
was
pleased
with
those
symptoms
of
reconciliation
;
and
*NL*
though
his
face
bore
some
marks
of
Susan
's
fist
,
and
many
more
of
her
*NL*
nails
,
he
rather
chose
to
be
contented
with
his
fortune
in
the
last
*NL*
battle
than
to
endeavour
at
bettering
it
in
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heroic
Susan
was
likewise
well
contented
with
her
victory
,
though
*NL*
it
had
cost
her
a
black
eye
,
which
Partridge
had
given
her
at
the
*NL*
first
onset
.
Between
these
two
,
therefore
,
a
league
was
struck
,
and
*NL*
those
hands
which
had
been
the
instruments
of
war
became
now
the
*NL*
mediators
of
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matters
were
thus
restored
to
a
perfect
calm
;
at
which
the
serjeant
,
*NL*
though
it
may
seem
so
contrary
to
the
principles
of
his
profession
,
*NL*
testified
his
approbation
.
``
Why
now
,
that
's
friendly
,
''
said
he
;
``
d
--
n
*NL*
me
,
I
hate
to
see
two
people
bear
ill-will
to
one
another
after
they
*NL*
have
had
a
tussel
.
The
only
way
when
friends
quarrel
is
to
see
it
out
*NL*
fairly
in
a
friendly
manner
,
as
a
man
may
call
it
,
either
with
a
fist
,
*NL*
or
sword
,
or
pistol
,
according
as
they
like
,
and
then
let
it
be
all
*NL*
over
;
for
my
own
part
,
d
--
n
me
if
ever
I
love
my
friend
better
than
*NL*
when
I
am
fighting
with
him
!
To
bear
malice
is
more
like
a
Frenchman
*NL*
than
an
Englishman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
proposed
a
libation
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
ceremony
at
all
*NL*
treaties
of
this
kind
.
Perhaps
the
reader
may
here
conclude
that
he
*NL*
was
well
versed
in
antient
history
;
but
this
,
though
highly
probable
,
*NL*
as
he
cited
no
authority
to
support
the
custom
,
I
will
not
affirm
with
*NL*
any
confidence
.
Most
likely
indeed
it
is
,
that
he
founded
his
opinion
*NL*
on
very
good
authority
,
since
he
confirmed
it
with
many
violent
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
no
sooner
heard
the
proposal
than
,
immediately
agreeing
with
the
*NL*
learned
serjeant
,
he
ordered
a
bowl
,
or
rather
a
large
mug
,
filled
*NL*
with
the
liquor
used
on
these
occasions
,
to
be
brought
in
,
and
then
*NL*
began
the
ceremony
himself
.
He
placed
his
right
hand
in
that
of
the
*NL*
landlord
,
and
,
seizing
the
bowl
with
his
left
,
uttered
the
usual
*NL*
words
,
and
then
made
his
libation
.
After
which
,
the
same
was
observed
*NL*
by
all
present
.
Indeed
,
there
is
very
little
need
of
being
particular
*NL*
in
describing
the
whole
form
,
as
it
differed
so
little
from
those
*NL*
libations
of
which
so
much
is
recorded
in
antient
authors
and
their
*NL*
modern
transcribers
.
The
principal
difference
lay
in
two
instances
;
*NL*
for
,
first
,
the
present
company
poured
the
liquor
only
down
their
*NL*
throats
;
and
,
secondly
,
the
serjeant
,
who
officiated
as
priest
,
drank
*NL*
the
last
;
but
he
preserved
,
I
believe
,
the
antient
form
,
in
swallowing
*NL*
much
the
largest
draught
of
the
whole
company
,
and
in
being
the
only
*NL*
person
present
who
contributed
nothing
towards
the
libation
besides
*NL*
his
good
offices
in
assisting
at
the
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
people
now
ranged
themselves
round
the
kitchen
fire
,
where
*NL*
good
humour
seemed
to
maintain
an
absolute
dominion
;
and
Partridge
not
*NL*
only
forgot
his
shameful
defeat
,
but
converted
hunger
into
thirst
,
and
*NL*
soon
became
extremely
facetious
.
We
must
however
quit
this
agreeable
*NL*
assembly
for
a
while
,
and
attend
Mr
Jones
to
Mrs
Waters
's
apartment
,
*NL*
where
the
dinner
which
he
had
bespoke
was
now
on
the
table
.
Indeed
,
it
*NL*
took
no
long
time
in
preparing
,
having
been
all
drest
three
days
*NL*
before
,
and
required
nothing
more
from
the
cook
than
to
warm
it
over
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
v
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
apology
for
all
heroes
who
have
good
stomachs
,
with
a
description
*NL*
of
a
battle
of
the
amorous
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Heroes
,
notwithstanding
the
high
ideas
which
,
by
the
means
of
*NL*
flatterers
,
they
may
entertain
of
themselves
,
or
the
world
may
*NL*
conceive
of
them
,
have
certainly
more
of
mortal
than
divine
about
*NL*
them
.
However
elevated
their
minds
may
be
,
their
bodies
at
least
*NL*
-LRB-
which
is
much
the
major
part
of
most
-RRB-
are
liable
to
the
worst
*NL*
infirmities
,
and
subject
to
the
vilest
offices
of
human
nature
.
Among
*NL*
these
latter
,
the
act
of
eating
,
which
hath
by
several
wise
men
been
*NL*
considered
as
extremely
mean
and
derogatory
from
the
philosophic
*NL*
dignity
,
must
be
in
some
measure
performed
by
the
greatest
prince
,
*NL*
heroe
,
or
philosopher
upon
earth
;
nay
,
sometimes
Nature
hath
been
so
*NL*
frolicsome
as
to
exact
of
these
dignified
characters
a
much
more
*NL*
exorbitant
share
of
this
office
than
she
hath
obliged
those
of
the
*NL*
lowest
order
to
perform
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
as
no
known
inhabitant
of
this
globe
is
really
more
*NL*
than
man
,
so
none
need
be
ashamed
of
submitting
to
what
the
*NL*
necessities
of
man
demand
;
but
when
those
great
personages
I
have
just
*NL*
mentioned
condescend
to
aim
at
confining
such
low
offices
to
*NL*
themselves
--
as
when
,
by
hoarding
or
destroying
,
they
seem
desirous
to
*NL*
prevent
any
others
from
eating
--
then
they
surely
become
very
low
and
*NL*
despicable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
after
this
short
preface
,
we
think
it
no
disparagement
to
our
*NL*
heroe
to
mention
the
immoderate
ardour
with
which
he
laid
about
him
at
*NL*
this
season
.
Indeed
,
it
may
be
doubted
whether
Ulysses
,
who
by
the
way
*NL*
seems
to
have
had
the
best
stomach
of
all
the
heroes
in
that
eating
*NL*
poem
of
the
Odyssey
,
ever
made
a
better
meal
.
Three
pounds
at
least
of
*NL*
that
flesh
which
formerly
had
contributed
to
the
composition
of
an
ox
*NL*
was
now
honoured
with
becoming
part
of
the
individual
Mr
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
particular
we
thought
ourselves
obliged
to
mention
,
as
it
may
*NL*
account
for
our
heroe
's
temporary
neglect
of
his
fair
companion
,
who
*NL*
eat
but
very
little
,
and
was
indeed
employed
in
considerations
of
a
*NL*
very
different
nature
,
which
passed
unobserved
by
Jones
,
till
he
had
*NL*
entirely
satisfied
that
appetite
which
a
fast
of
twenty-four
hours
had
*NL*
procured
him
;
but
his
dinner
was
no
sooner
ended
than
his
attention
to
*NL*
other
matters
revived
;
with
these
matters
therefore
we
shall
now
*NL*
proceed
to
acquaint
the
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
,
of
whose
personal
accomplishments
we
have
hitherto
said
very
*NL*
little
,
was
,
in
reality
,
one
of
the
handsomest
young
fellows
in
the
*NL*
world
.
His
face
,
besides
being
the
picture
of
health
,
had
in
it
the
*NL*
most
apparent
marks
of
sweetness
and
good-nature
.
These
qualities
were
*NL*
indeed
so
characteristical
in
his
countenance
,
that
,
while
the
spirit
*NL*
and
sensibility
in
his
eyes
,
though
they
must
have
been
perceived
by
*NL*
an
accurate
observer
,
might
have
escaped
the
notice
of
the
less
*NL*
discerning
,
so
strongly
was
this
good-nature
painted
in
his
look
,
that
*NL*
it
was
remarked
by
almost
every
one
who
saw
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
perhaps
,
as
much
owing
to
this
as
to
a
very
fine
complexion
*NL*
that
his
face
had
a
delicacy
in
it
almost
inexpressible
,
and
which
*NL*
might
have
given
him
an
air
rather
too
effeminate
,
had
it
not
been
*NL*
joined
to
a
most
masculine
person
and
mien
:
which
latter
had
as
much
*NL*
in
them
of
the
Hercules
as
the
former
had
of
the
Adonis
.
He
was
*NL*
besides
active
,
genteel
,
gay
,
and
good-humoured
;
and
had
a
flow
of
*NL*
animal
spirits
which
enlivened
every
conversation
where
he
was
*NL*
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
reader
hath
duly
reflected
on
these
many
charms
which
all
*NL*
centered
in
our
heroe
,
and
considers
at
the
same
time
the
fresh
*NL*
obligations
which
Mrs
Waters
had
to
him
,
it
will
be
a
mark
more
of
*NL*
prudery
than
candour
to
entertain
a
bad
opinion
of
her
because
she
*NL*
conceived
a
very
good
opinion
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
whatever
censures
may
be
passed
upon
her
,
it
is
my
business
to
*NL*
relate
matters
of
fact
with
veracity
.
Mrs
Waters
had
,
in
truth
,
not
*NL*
only
a
good
opinion
of
our
heroe
,
but
a
very
great
affection
for
him
.
*NL*
To
speak
out
boldly
at
once
,
she
was
in
love
,
according
to
the
present
*NL*
universally-received
sense
of
that
phrase
,
by
which
love
is
applied
*NL*
indiscriminately
to
the
desirable
objects
of
all
our
passions
,
*NL*
appetites
,
and
senses
,
and
is
understood
to
be
that
preference
which
*NL*
we
give
to
one
kind
of
food
rather
than
to
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
the
love
to
these
several
objects
may
possibly
be
one
and
*NL*
the
same
in
all
cases
,
its
operations
however
must
be
allowed
to
be
*NL*
different
;
for
,
how
much
soever
we
may
be
in
love
with
an
excellent
*NL*
surloin
of
beef
,
or
bottle
of
Burgundy
;
with
a
damask
rose
,
or
Cremona
*NL*
fiddle
;
yet
do
we
never
smile
,
nor
ogle
,
nor
dress
,
nor
flatter
,
nor
*NL*
endeavour
by
any
other
arts
or
tricks
to
gain
the
affection
of
the
*NL*
said
beef
,
&
c.
Sigh
indeed
we
sometimes
may
;
but
it
is
generally
in
*NL*
the
absence
,
not
in
the
presence
,
of
the
beloved
object
.
For
otherwise
*NL*
we
might
possibly
complain
of
their
ingratitude
and
deafness
,
with
the
*NL*
same
reason
as
Pasiphae
doth
of
her
bull
,
whom
she
endeavoured
to
*NL*
engage
by
all
the
coquetry
practised
with
good
success
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
on
the
much
more
sensible
as
well
as
tender
hearts
of
the
*NL*
fine
gentlemen
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
contrary
happens
in
that
love
which
operates
between
persons
of
*NL*
the
same
species
,
but
of
different
sexes
.
Here
we
are
no
sooner
in
*NL*
love
than
it
becomes
our
principal
care
to
engage
the
affection
of
the
*NL*
object
beloved
.
For
what
other
purpose
indeed
are
our
youth
instructed
*NL*
in
all
the
arts
of
rendering
themselves
agreeable
?
If
it
was
not
with
*NL*
a
view
to
this
love
,
I
question
whether
any
of
those
trades
which
deal
*NL*
in
setting
off
and
adorning
the
human
person
would
procure
a
*NL*
livelihood
.
Nay
,
those
great
polishers
of
our
manners
,
who
are
by
some
*NL*
thought
to
teach
what
principally
distinguishes
us
from
the
brute
*NL*
creation
,
even
dancing-masters
themselves
,
might
possibly
find
no
*NL*
place
in
society
.
In
short
,
all
the
graces
which
young
ladies
and
*NL*
young
gentlemen
too
learn
from
others
,
and
the
many
improvements
*NL*
which
,
by
the
help
of
a
looking-glass
,
they
add
of
their
own
,
are
in
*NL*
reality
those
very
_
spicula
et
faces
amoris
_
so
often
mentioned
by
*NL*
Ovid
;
or
,
as
they
are
sometimes
called
in
our
own
language
,
the
whole
*NL*
artillery
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Mrs
Waters
and
our
heroe
had
no
sooner
sat
down
together
than
the
*NL*
former
began
to
play
this
artillery
upon
the
latter
.
But
here
,
as
we
*NL*
are
about
to
attempt
a
description
hitherto
unassayed
either
in
prose
*NL*
or
verse
,
we
think
proper
to
invoke
the
assistance
of
certain
aerial
*NL*
beings
,
who
will
,
we
doubt
not
,
come
kindly
to
our
aid
on
this
*NL*
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
then
,
ye
Graces
!
you
that
inhabit
the
heavenly
mansions
of
*NL*
Seraphina
's
countenance
;
for
you
are
truly
divine
,
are
always
in
her
*NL*
presence
,
and
well
know
all
the
arts
of
charming
;
say
,
what
were
the
*NL*
weapons
now
used
to
captivate
the
heart
of
Mr
Jones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
,
from
two
lovely
blue
eyes
,
whose
bright
orbs
flashed
lightning
*NL*
at
their
discharge
,
flew
forth
two
pointed
ogles
;
but
,
happily
for
our
*NL*
heroe
,
hit
only
a
vast
piece
of
beef
which
he
was
then
conveying
into
*NL*
his
plate
,
and
harmless
spent
their
force
.
The
fair
warrior
perceived
*NL*
their
miscarriage
,
and
immediately
from
her
fair
bosom
drew
forth
a
*NL*
deadly
sigh
.
A
sigh
which
none
could
have
heard
unmoved
,
and
which
was
*NL*
sufficient
at
once
to
have
swept
off
a
dozen
beaus
;
so
soft
,
so
sweet
,
*NL*
so
tender
,
that
the
insinuating
air
must
have
found
its
subtle
way
to
*NL*
the
heart
of
our
heroe
,
had
it
not
luckily
been
driven
from
his
ears
*NL*
by
the
coarse
bubbling
of
some
bottled
ale
,
which
at
that
time
he
was
*NL*
pouring
forth
.
Many
other
weapons
did
she
assay
;
but
the
god
of
eating
*NL*
-LRB-
if
there
be
any
such
deity
,
for
I
do
not
confidently
assert
it
-RRB-
*NL*
preserved
his
votary
;
or
perhaps
it
may
not
be
_
dignus
vindice
nodus
_
,
*NL*
and
the
present
security
of
Jones
may
be
accounted
for
by
natural
*NL*
means
;
for
as
love
frequently
preserves
from
the
attacks
of
hunger
,
so
*NL*
may
hunger
possibly
,
in
some
cases
,
defend
us
against
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fair
one
,
enraged
at
her
frequent
disappointments
,
determined
on
*NL*
a
short
cessation
of
arms
.
Which
interval
she
employed
in
making
ready
*NL*
every
engine
of
amorous
warfare
for
the
renewing
of
the
attack
when
*NL*
dinner
should
be
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
sooner
then
was
the
cloth
removed
than
she
again
began
her
*NL*
operations
.
First
,
having
planted
her
right
eye
sidewise
against
Mr
*NL*
Jones
,
she
shot
from
its
corner
a
most
penetrating
glance
;
which
,
*NL*
though
great
part
of
its
force
was
spent
before
it
reached
our
heroe
,
*NL*
did
not
vent
itself
absolutely
without
effect
.
This
the
fair
one
*NL*
perceiving
,
hastily
withdrew
her
eyes
,
and
levelled
them
downwards
,
as
*NL*
if
she
was
concerned
for
what
she
had
done
;
though
by
this
means
she
*NL*
designed
only
to
draw
him
from
his
guard
,
and
indeed
to
open
his
eyes
,
*NL*
through
which
she
intended
to
surprize
his
heart
.
And
now
,
gently
*NL*
lifting
up
those
two
bright
orbs
which
had
already
begun
to
make
an
*NL*
impression
on
poor
Jones
,
she
discharged
a
volley
of
small
charms
at
*NL*
once
from
her
whole
countenance
in
a
smile
.
Not
a
smile
of
mirth
,
nor
*NL*
of
joy
;
but
a
smile
of
affection
,
which
most
ladies
have
always
ready
*NL*
at
their
command
,
and
which
serves
them
to
show
at
once
their
*NL*
good-humour
,
their
pretty
dimples
,
and
their
white
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
smile
our
heroe
received
full
in
his
eyes
,
and
was
immediately
*NL*
staggered
with
its
force
.
He
then
began
to
see
the
designs
of
the
*NL*
enemy
,
and
indeed
to
feel
their
success
.
A
parley
now
was
set
on
foot
*NL*
between
the
parties
;
during
which
the
artful
fair
so
slily
and
*NL*
imperceptibly
carried
on
her
attack
,
that
she
had
almost
subdued
the
*NL*
heart
of
our
heroe
before
she
again
repaired
to
acts
of
hostility
.
To
*NL*
confess
the
truth
,
I
am
afraid
Mr
Jones
maintained
a
kind
of
Dutch
*NL*
defence
,
and
treacherously
delivered
up
the
garrison
,
without
duly
*NL*
weighing
his
allegiance
to
the
fair
Sophia
.
In
short
,
no
sooner
had
*NL*
the
amorous
parley
ended
and
the
lady
had
unmasked
the
royal
battery
,
*NL*
by
carelessly
letting
her
handkerchief
drop
from
her
neck
,
than
the
*NL*
heart
of
Mr
Jones
was
entirely
taken
,
and
the
fair
conqueror
enjoyed
*NL*
the
usual
fruits
of
her
victory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
Graces
think
proper
to
end
their
description
,
and
here
we
*NL*
think
proper
to
end
the
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
friendly
conversation
in
the
kitchen
,
which
had
a
very
common
,
*NL*
though
not
very
friendly
,
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
our
lovers
were
entertaining
themselves
in
the
manner
which
is
*NL*
partly
described
in
the
foregoing
chapter
,
they
were
likewise
*NL*
furnishing
out
an
entertainment
for
their
good
friends
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
And
this
in
a
double
sense
,
by
affording
them
matter
for
their
*NL*
conversation
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
drink
to
enliven
their
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
now
assembled
round
the
kitchen
fire
,
besides
my
landlord
*NL*
and
landlady
,
who
occasionally
went
backward
and
forward
,
Mr
*NL*
Partridge
,
the
serjeant
,
and
the
coachman
who
drove
the
young
lady
and
*NL*
her
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
having
acquainted
the
company
with
what
he
had
learnt
from
*NL*
the
Man
of
the
Hill
concerning
the
situation
in
which
Mrs
Waters
had
*NL*
been
found
by
Jones
,
the
serjeant
proceeded
to
that
part
of
her
*NL*
history
which
was
known
to
him
.
He
said
she
was
the
wife
of
Mr
Waters
,
*NL*
who
was
a
captain
in
their
regiment
,
and
had
often
been
with
him
at
*NL*
quarters
.
``
Some
folks
,
''
says
he
,
``
used
indeed
to
doubt
whether
they
*NL*
were
lawfully
married
in
a
church
or
no
.
But
,
for
my
part
,
that
's
no
*NL*
business
of
mine
:
I
must
own
,
if
I
was
put
to
my
corporal
oath
,
I
*NL*
believe
she
is
little
better
than
one
of
us
;
and
I
fancy
the
captain
*NL*
may
go
to
heaven
when
the
sun
shines
upon
a
rainy
day
.
But
if
he
does
,
*NL*
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
;
for
he
wo
n't
want
company
.
And
the
*NL*
lady
,
to
give
the
devil
his
due
,
is
a
very
good
sort
of
lady
,
and
*NL*
loves
the
cloth
,
and
is
always
desirous
to
do
strict
justice
to
it
;
*NL*
for
she
hath
begged
off
many
a
poor
soldier
,
and
,
by
her
good-will
,
*NL*
would
never
have
any
of
them
punished
.
But
yet
,
to
be
sure
,
Ensign
*NL*
Northerton
and
she
were
very
well
acquainted
together
at
our
last
*NL*
quarters
;
that
is
the
very
right
and
truth
of
the
matter
.
But
the
*NL*
captain
he
knows
nothing
about
it
;
and
as
long
as
there
is
enough
for
*NL*
him
too
,
what
does
it
signify
?
He
loves
her
not
a
bit
the
worse
,
and
I
*NL*
am
certain
would
run
any
man
through
the
body
that
was
to
abuse
her
;
*NL*
therefore
I
wo
n't
abuse
her
,
for
my
part
.
I
only
repeat
what
other
*NL*
folks
say
;
and
,
to
be
certain
,
what
everybody
says
,
there
must
be
some
*NL*
truth
in
.
''
--
``
Ay
,
ay
,
a
great
deal
of
truth

I
warrant
you

cries
*NL*
Partridge
;

Veritas

parit

--
``
All
a
parcel
of
scandalous
*NL*
stuff

answered
the
mistress
of
the
house
.
``
I
am
sure
,
now
she
is

drest

looks
like

very
good

and
she
behaves
*NL*
herself

gave
me
a
guinea
for
the
use
of
my
*NL*
cloaths

``
A
very
good
lady
indeed

cries
the
landlord
;
``
and
if
you
*NL*
had
not
been
a
little
too
hasty
,
you
would
not
have
quarrelled

her
as
you
did
at
first
.

--
``
You
need
mention
that
with
my
truly

*NL*
answered
she
:
``
if
it
had
not
been
for
your
nonsense

nothing

happened

throw
in

``
Well

well

answered
he
;
``
what
's
*NL*
past
can
not
be
mended
,
so
there
's
an
end
of
the
matter

``
Yes
,

cries
*NL*
she
,
``
for
this
once

will
it
be
mended

This
is
not

meddle
only

in
matters
without

n't
you
remember

happened

years
ago

``
Nay

returned
he
,
``
do
n't

up
old

sorry
for
what
I

have
done

''
The
landlady
was
going
to
reply
,
but
was
prevented
by
the
*NL*
peace-making
serjeant
,
sorely
to
the
displeasure
of
Partridge
,
who
was
*NL*
a
great
lover
of
what
is
called
fun
,
and
a
great
promoter
of
those
*NL*
harmless
quarrels
which
tend
rather
to
the
production
of
comical
than
*NL*
tragical
incidents
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
serjeant
asked
Partridge
whither
he
and
his
master
were
travelling
?
*NL*
``
None
of
your
magisters

answered
Partridge
;

Partridge

words
both
landlord

pricked
up
their

my

to
make
such
mistakes
?
''
--
``
But
how
comes
it
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
cries
the
landlord
,
``
that
such
a
great
gentleman
walks
about
the
*NL*
country
afoot
?
''
--
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
returned
Partridge
;
``
great
gentlemen
*NL*
have
humours
sometimes
.
He
hath
now
a
dozen
horses
and
servants
at
*NL*
Gloucester
;
and
nothing
would
serve
him
,
but
last
night
,
it
being
very
*NL*
hot
weather
,
he
must
cool
himself
with
a
walk
to
yon
high
hill
,
whither
*NL*
I
likewise
walked
with
him
to
bear
him
company
;
but
if
ever
you
catch
*NL*
me
there
again
:
for
I
was
never
so
frightened
in
all
my
life
.
We
met
*NL*
with
the
strangest
man
there
.
''
--
``
I
'll
be
hanged
,
''
cries
the
landlord
,
*NL*
``
if
it
was
not
the
Man
of
the
Hill
,
as
they
call
him
;
if
indeed
he
be
a
*NL*
man
;
but
I
know
several
people
who
believe
it
is
the
devil
that
lives
*NL*
there
.
''
--
``
Nay
,
nay
,
like
enough
,
''
says
Partridge
;
``
and
now
you
put
me
*NL*
in
the
head
of
it
,
I
verily
and
sincerely
believe
it
was
the
devil
,
*NL*
though
I
could
not
perceive
his
cloven
foot
:
but
perhaps
he
might
have
*NL*
the
power
given
him
to
hide
that
,
since
evil
spirits
can
appear
in
what
*NL*
shapes
they
please
.
''
--
``
And
pray
,
sir
,
''
says
the
serjeant
,
``
no
offence
,
*NL*
I
hope
;
but
pray
what
sort
of
a
gentleman
is
the
devil
?
For
I
have
*NL*
heard
some
of
our
officers
say
there
is
no
such
person
;
and
that
it
is
*NL*
only
a
trick
of
the
parsons
,
to
prevent
their
being
broke
;
for
,
if
it
*NL*
was
publickly
known
that
there
was
no
devil
,
the
parsons
would
be
of
no
*NL*
more
use
than
we
are
in
time
of
peace
.
''
--
``
Those
officers
,
''
says
*NL*
Partridge
,
``
are
very
great
scholars
,
I
suppose
.
''
--
``
Not
much
of
*NL*
schollards
neither
,
''
answered
the
serjeant
;
``
they
have
not
half
your
*NL*
learning
,
sir
,
I
believe
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
I
thought
there
must
be
a
*NL*
devil
,
notwithstanding
what
they
said
,
though
one
of
them
was
a
*NL*
captain
;
for
methought
,
thinks
I
to
myself
,
if
there
be
no
devil
,
how
*NL*
can
wicked
people
be
sent
to
him
?
and
I
have
read
all
that
upon
a
*NL*
book
.
''
--
``
Some
of
your
officers
,
''
quoth
the
landlord
,
``
will
find
there
*NL*
is
a
devil
,
to
their
shame
,
I
believe
.
I
do
n't
question
but
he
'll
pay
*NL*
off
some
old
scores
upon
my
account
.
Here
was
one
quartered
upon
me
*NL*
half
a
year
,
who
had
the
conscience
to
take
up
one
of
my
best
beds
,
*NL*
though
he
hardly
spent
a
shilling
a
day
in
the
house
,
and
suffered
his
*NL*
men
to
roast
cabbages
at
the
kitchen
fire
,
because
I
would
not
give
*NL*
them
a
dinner
on
a
Sunday
.
Every
good
Christian
must
desire
there
*NL*
should
be
a
devil
for
the
punishment
of
such
wretches
.
''
--
``
Harkee
,
*NL*

''
said
the
serjeant
,
``
do
n't
abuse
the
cloth
,
for
I
wo
n't
take
*NL*
it
.
''
--
``
D

the

''
answered
the
landlord
,
``
I
have
suffered
enough
*NL*
by
them
.
''
--
``
Bear
witness
,
gentlemen
,
''
says
the
serjeant
,
``
he
curses
the
*NL*
king
,
and
that
's
high
treason
.
''
--
``
I
curse
the

you
villain
,
''
said
*NL*
the
landlord
.
``
Yes
,
you
did
,
''
cries
the
serjeant
;
``
you
cursed
the
*NL*

,
and
that
's
cursing
the

It
's
all
one
and
the
same
;
for
*NL*
every
man
who
curses
the
cloth
would
curse
the
king
if
he
durst
;
so
for

o

that
,
it
's
all
one
and
the
same
thing
.
''
--
``
Excuse
me
there
,
Mr
*NL*
Serjeant
,
''
quoth
Partridge
,
``
that
's
a
_
non
sequitur
_
.
''
--
``
None
of
your
*NL*
outlandish
linguo
,
''
answered
the
serjeant
,
leaping
from
his
seat
;
``
I
*NL*
will
not
sit
still
and
hear
the
cloth
abused
.
''
--
``
You
mistake
me
,
*NL*
friend
,
''
cries
Partridge
.
``
I
did
not
mean
to
abuse
the
cloth
;
I
only
*NL*
said
your
conclusion
was
a
_
non

_
.
-LSB-

''
--
``
You
*NL*
are
another
,
''
cries
the
serjeant
,
''
an
you
come
to
that
.
No
more
a
*NL*
_
sequitur
_
than
yourself
.
You
are
a
pack
of
rascals
,
and
I
'll
prove
it
;
*NL*
for
I
will
fight
the
best
man
of
you
all
for
twenty
pound
.
''
This
*NL*
challenge
effectually
silenced
Partridge
,
whose
stomach
for
drubbing
*NL*
did
not
so
soon
return
after
the
hearty
meal
which
he
had
lately
been
*NL*
treated
with
;
but
the
coachman
,
whose
bones
were
less
sore
,
and
whose
*NL*
appetite
for
fighting
was
somewhat
sharper
,
did
not
so
easily
brook
the
*NL*
affront
,
of
which
he
conceived
some
part
at
least
fell
to
his
share
.
He
*NL*
started
therefore
from
his
seat
,
and
,
advancing
to
the
serjeant
,
swore
*NL*
he
looked
on
himself
to
be
as
good
a
man
as
any
in
the
army
,
and
*NL*
offered
to
box
for
a
guinea
.
The
military
man
accepted
the
combat
,
but
*NL*
refused
the
wager
;
upon
which
both
immediately
stript
and
engaged
,
till
*NL*
the
driver
of
horses
was
so
well
mauled
by
the
leader
of
men
,
that
he
*NL*
was
obliged
to
exhaust
his
small
remainder
of
breath
in
begging
for
*NL*
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
This
word
,
which
the
serjeant
unhappily
mistook
for
an
affront
,
*NL*
is
a
term
in
logic
,
and
means
that
the
conclusion
does
not
follow
*NL*
from
the
premises
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
was
now
desirous
to
depart
,
and
had
given
orders
for
*NL*
her
coach
to
be
prepared
;
but
all
in
vain
,
for
the
coachman
was
*NL*
disabled
from
performing
his
office
for
that
evening
.
An
antient
*NL*
heathen
would
perhaps
have
imputed
this
disability
to
the
god
of
*NL*
drink
,
no
less
than
to
the
god
of
war
;
for
,
in
reality
,
both
the
*NL*
combatants
had
sacrificed
as
well
to
the
former
deity
as
to
the
*NL*
latter
.
To
speak
plainly
,
they
were
both
dead
drunk
,
nor
was
Partridge
*NL*
in
a
much
better
situation
.
As
for
my
landlord
,
drinking
was
his
*NL*
trade
;
and
the
liquor
had
no
more
effect
on
him
than
it
had
on
any
*NL*
other
vessel
in
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mistress
of
the
inn
,
being
summoned
to
attend
Mr
Jones
and
his
*NL*
companion
at
their
tea
,
gave
a
full
relation
of
the
latter
part
of
the
*NL*
foregoing
scene
;
and
at
the
same
time
expressed
great
concern
for
the
*NL*
young
lady
,
``
who
,
''
she
said
,
``
was
under
the
utmost
uneasiness
at
being
*NL*
prevented
from
pursuing
her
journey
.
She
is
a
sweet
pretty
creature
,
''
*NL*
added
she
,
``
and
I
am
certain
I
have
seen
her
face
before
.
I
fancy
she
*NL*
is
in
love
,
and
running
away
from
her
friends
.
Who
knows
but
some
*NL*
young
gentleman
or
other
may
be
expecting
her
,
with
a
heart
as
heavy
*NL*
as
her
own
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
fetched
a
heavy
sigh
at
those
words
;
of
which
,
though
Mrs
Waters
*NL*
observed
it
,
she
took
no
notice
while
the
landlady
continued
in
the
*NL*
room
;
but
,
after
the
departure
of
that
good
woman
,
she
could
not
*NL*
forbear
giving
our
heroe
certain
hints
on
her
suspecting
some
very
*NL*
dangerous
rival
in
his
affections
.
The
aukward
behaviour
of
Mr
Jones
*NL*
on
this
occasion
convinced
her
of
the
truth
,
without
his
giving
her
a
*NL*
direct
answer
to
any
of
her
questions
;
but
she
was
not
nice
enough
in
*NL*
her
amours
to
be
greatly
concerned
at
the
discovery
.
The
beauty
of
*NL*
Jones
highly
charmed
her
eye
;
but
as
she
could
not
see
his
heart
,
she
*NL*
gave
herself
no
concern
about
it
.
She
could
feast
heartily
at
the
*NL*
table
of
love
,
without
reflecting
that
some
other
already
had
been
,
or
*NL*
hereafter
might
be
,
feasted
with
the
same
repast
.
A
sentiment
which
,
*NL*
if
it
deals
but
little
in
refinement
,
deals
,
however
,
much
in
*NL*
substance
;
and
is
less
capricious
,
and
perhaps
less
ill-natured
and
*NL*
selfish
,
than
the
desires
of
those
females
who
can
be
contented
enough
*NL*
to
abstain
from
the
possession
of
their
lovers
,
provided
they
are
*NL*
sufficiently
satisfied
that
no
one
else
possesses
them
.

*NL*
Containing
a
fuller
account
of
Mrs
Waters
,
and
by
what
means
she
came
*NL*
into
that
distressful
situation
from
which
she
was
rescued
by
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Nature
hath
by
no
means
mixed
up
an
equal
share
either
of
*NL*
curiosity
or
vanity
in
every
human
composition
,
there
is
perhaps
no
*NL*
individual
to
whom
she
hath
not
allotted
such
a
proportion
of
both
as
*NL*
requires
much
arts
,
and
pains
too
,
to
subdue
and
keep
under
;
--
a
*NL*
conquest
,
however
,
absolutely
necessary
to
every
one
who
would
in
any
*NL*
degree
deserve
the
characters
of
wisdom
or
good
breeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Jones
,
therefore
,
might
very
justly
be
called
a
well-bred
man
,
he
*NL*
had
stifled
all
that
curiosity
which
the
extraordinary
manner
in
which
*NL*
he
had
found
Mrs
Waters
must
be
supposed
to
have
occasioned
.
He
had
,
*NL*
indeed
,
at
first
thrown
out
some
few
hints
to
the
lady
;
but
,
when
he
*NL*
perceived
her
industriously
avoiding
any
explanation
,
he
was
contented
*NL*
to
remain
in
ignorance
,
the
rather
as
he
was
not
without
suspicion
*NL*
that
there
were
some
circumstances
which
must
have
raised
her
blushes
,
*NL*
had
she
related
the
whole
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
since
it
is
possible
that
some
of
our
readers
may
not
so
easily
*NL*
acquiesce
under
the
same
ignorance
,
and
as
we
are
very
desirous
to
*NL*
satisfy
them
all
,
we
have
taken
uncommon
pains
to
inform
ourselves
of
*NL*
the
real
fact
,
with
the
relation
of
which
we
shall
conclude
this
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
lady
,
then
,
had
lived
some
years
with
one
Captain
Waters
,
who
was
*NL*
a
captain
in
the
same
regiment
to
which
Mr
Northerton
belonged
.
She
*NL*
past
for
that
gentleman
's
wife
,
and
went
by
his
name
;
and
yet
,
as
the
*NL*
serjeant
said
,
there
were
some
doubts
concerning
the
reality
of
their
*NL*
marriage
,
which
we
shall
not
at
present
take
upon
us
to
resolve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
it
,
had
for
some
time
contracted
an
*NL*
intimacy
with
the
above-mentioned
ensign
,
which
did
no
great
credit
to
*NL*
her
reputation
.
That
she
had
a
remarkable
fondness
for
that
young
*NL*
fellow
is
most
certain
;
but
whether
she
indulged
this
to
any
very
*NL*
criminal
lengths
is
not
so
extremely
clear
,
unless
we
will
suppose
*NL*
that
women
never
grant
every
favour
to
a
man
but
one
,
without
granting
*NL*
him
that
one
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
division
of
the
regiment
to
which
Captain
Waters
belonged
had
two
*NL*
days
preceded
the
march
of
that
company
to
which
Mr
Northerton
was
the
*NL*
ensign
;
so
that
the
former
had
reached
Worcester
the
very
day
after
*NL*
the
unfortunate
re-encounter
between
Jones
and
Northerton
which
we
*NL*
have
before
recorded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
it
had
been
agreed
between
Mrs
Waters
and
the
captain
that
she
*NL*
would
accompany
him
in
his
march
as
far
as
Worcester
,
where
they
were
*NL*
to
take
their
leave
of
each
other
,
and
she
was
thence
to
return
to
*NL*
Bath
,
where
she
was
to
stay
till
the
end
of
the
winter
's
campaign
*NL*
against
the
rebels
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
agreement
Mr
Northerton
was
made
acquainted
.
To
say
the
*NL*
truth
,
the
lady
had
made
him
an
assignation
at
this
very
place
,
and
*NL*
promised
to
stay
at
Worcester
till
his
division
came
thither
;
with
*NL*
what
view
,
and
for
what
purpose
,
must
be
left
to
the
reader
's
*NL*
divination
;
for
,
though
we
are
obliged
to
relate
facts
,
we
are
not
*NL*
obliged
to
do
a
violence
to
our
nature
by
any
comments
to
the
*NL*
disadvantage
of
the
loveliest
part
of
the
creation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Northerton
no
sooner
obtained
a
release
from
his
captivity
,
as
we
have
*NL*
seen
,
than
he
hasted
away
to
overtake
Mrs
Waters
;
which
,
as
he
was
a
*NL*
very
active
nimble
fellow
,
he
did
at
the
last-mentioned
city
,
some
few
*NL*
hours
after
Captain
Waters
had
left
her
.
At
his
first
arrival
he
made
*NL*
no
scruple
of
acquainting
her
with
the
unfortunate
accident
;
which
he
*NL*
made
appear
very
unfortunate
indeed
,
for
he
totally
extracted
every
*NL*
particle
of
what
could
be
called
fault
,
at
least
in
a
court
of
honour
,
*NL*
though
he
left
some
circumstances
which
might
be
questionable
in
a
*NL*
court
of
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
Women
,
to
their
glory
be
it
spoken
,
are
more
generally
capable
of
that
*NL*
violent
and
apparently
disinterested
passion
of
love
,
which
seeks
only
*NL*
the
good
of
its
object
,
than
men
.
Mrs
Waters
,
therefore
,
was
no
sooner
*NL*
apprized
of
the
danger
to
which
her
lover
was
exposed
,
than
she
lost
*NL*
every
consideration
besides
that
of
his
safety
;
and
this
being
a
*NL*
matter
equally
agreeable
to
the
gentleman
,
it
became
the
immediate
*NL*
subject
of
debate
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
much
consultation
on
this
matter
,
it
was
at
length
agreed
that
*NL*
the
ensign
should
go
across
the
country
to
Hereford
,
whence
he
might
*NL*
find
some
conveyance
to
one
of
the
sea-ports
in
Wales
,
and
thence
*NL*
might
make
his
escape
abroad
.
In
all
which
expedition
Mrs
Waters
*NL*
declared
she
would
bear
him
company
;
and
for
which
she
was
able
to
*NL*
furnish
him
with
money
,
a
very
material
article
to
Mr
Northerton
,
she
*NL*
having
then
in
her
pocket
three
bank-notes
to
the
amount
of
L90
,
*NL*
besides
some
cash
,
and
a
diamond
ring
of
pretty
considerable
value
on
*NL*
her
finger
.
All
which
she
,
with
the
utmost
confidence
,
revealed
to
*NL*
this
wicked
man
,
little
suspecting
she
should
by
these
means
inspire
*NL*
him
with
a
design
of
robbing
her
.
Now
,
as
they
must
,
by
taking
horses
*NL*
from
Worcester
,
have
furnished
any
pursuers
with
the
means
of
*NL*
hereafter
discovering
their
route
,
the
ensign
proposed
,
and
the
lady
*NL*
presently
agreed
,
to
make
their
first
stage
on
foot
;
for
which
purpose
*NL*
the
hardness
of
the
frost
was
very
seasonable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
main
part
of
the
lady
's
baggage
was
already
at
Bath
,
and
she
had
*NL*
nothing
with
her
at
present
besides
a
very
small
quantity
of
linen
,
*NL*
which
the
gallant
undertook
to
carry
in
his
own
pockets
.
All
things
,
*NL*
therefore
,
being
settled
in
the
evening
,
they
arose
early
the
next
*NL*
morning
,
and
at
five
o'clock
departed
from
Worcester
,
it
being
then
*NL*
above
two
hours
before
day
,
but
the
moon
,
which
was
then
at
the
full
,
*NL*
gave
them
all
the
light
she
was
capable
of
affording
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
was
not
of
that
delicate
race
of
women
who
are
obliged
to
*NL*
the
invention
of
vehicles
for
the
capacity
of
removing
themselves
from
*NL*
one
place
to
another
,
and
with
whom
consequently
a
coach
is
reckoned
*NL*
among
the
necessaries
of
life
.
Her
limbs
were
indeed
full
of
strength
*NL*
and
agility
,
and
,
as
her
mind
was
no
less
animated
with
spirit
,
she
*NL*
was
perfectly
able
to
keep
pace
with
her
nimble
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
travelled
on
for
some
miles
in
a
high
road
,
which
Northerton
*NL*
said
he
was
informed
led
to
Hereford
,
they
came
at
the
break
of
day
to
*NL*
the
side
of
a
large
wood
,
where
he
suddenly
stopped
,
and
,
affecting
to
*NL*
meditate
a
moment
with
himself
,
expressed
some
apprehensions
from
*NL*
travelling
any
longer
in
so
public
a
way
.
Upon
which
he
easily
*NL*
persuaded
his
fair
companion
to
strike
with
him
into
a
path
which
*NL*
seemed
to
lead
directly
through
the
wood
,
and
which
at
length
brought
*NL*
them
both
to
the
bottom
of
Mazard
Hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
the
execrable
scheme
which
he
now
attempted
to
execute
was
the
*NL*
effect
of
previous
deliberation
,
or
whether
it
now
first
came
into
his
*NL*
head
,
I
can
not
determine
.
But
being
arrived
in
this
lonely
place
,
*NL*
where
it
was
very
improbable
he
should
meet
with
any
interruption
,
he
*NL*
suddenly
slipped
his
garter
from
his
leg
,
and
,
laying
violent
hands
on
*NL*
the
poor
woman
,
endeavoured
to
perpetrate
that
dreadful
and
detestable
*NL*
fact
which
we
have
before
commemorated
,
and
which
the
providential
*NL*
appearance
of
Jones
did
so
fortunately
prevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happy
was
it
for
Mrs
Waters
that
she
was
not
of
the
weakest
order
of
*NL*
females
;
for
no
sooner
did
she
perceive
,
by
his
tying
a
knot
in
his
*NL*
garter
,
and
by
his
declarations
,
what
his
hellish
intentions
were
,
*NL*
than
she
stood
stoutly
to
her
defence
,
and
so
strongly
struggled
with
*NL*
her
enemy
,
screaming
all
the
while
for
assistance
,
that
she
delayed
*NL*
the
execution
of
the
villain
's
purpose
several
minutes
,
by
which
means
*NL*
Mr
Jones
came
to
her
relief
at
that
very
instant
when
her
strength
*NL*
failed
and
she
was
totally
overpowered
,
and
delivered
her
from
the
*NL*
ruffian
's
hands
,
with
no
other
loss
than
that
of
her
cloaths
,
which
*NL*
were
torn
from
her
back
,
and
of
the
diamond
ring
,
which
during
the
*NL*
contention
either
dropped
from
her
finger
,
or
was
wrenched
from
it
by
*NL*
Northerton
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
reader
,
we
have
given
thee
the
fruits
of
a
very
painful
enquiry
*NL*
which
for
thy
satisfaction
we
have
made
into
this
matter
.
And
here
we
*NL*
have
opened
to
thee
a
scene
of
folly
as
well
as
villany
,
which
we
*NL*
could
scarce
have
believed
a
human
creature
capable
of
being
guilty
*NL*
of
,
had
we
not
remembered
that
this
fellow
was
at
that
time
firmly
*NL*
persuaded
that
he
had
already
committed
a
murder
,
and
had
forfeited
*NL*
his
life
to
the
law
.
As
he
concluded
therefore
that
his
only
safety
*NL*
lay
in
flight
,
he
thought
the
possessing
himself
of
this
poor
woman
's
*NL*
money
and
ring
would
make
him
amends
for
the
additional
burthen
he
was
*NL*
to
lay
on
his
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
,
reader
,
we
must
strictly
caution
thee
that
thou
dost
not
*NL*
take
any
occasion
,
from
the
misbehaviour
of
such
a
wretch
as
this
,
to
*NL*
reflect
on
so
worthy
and
honourable
a
body
of
men
as
are
the
officers
*NL*
of
our
army
in
general
.
Thou
wilt
be
pleased
to
consider
that
this
*NL*
fellow
,
as
we
have
already
informed
thee
,
had
neither
the
birth
nor
*NL*
education
of
a
gentleman
,
nor
was
a
proper
person
to
be
enrolled
among
*NL*
the
number
of
such
.
If
,
therefore
,
his
baseness
can
justly
reflect
on
*NL*
any
besides
himself
,
it
must
be
only
on
those
who
gave
him
his
*NL*
commission
.

BOOK

*NL*
*NL*
IN
WHICH
THE
HISTORY
GOES
FORWARD
ABOUT
TWELVE
HOURS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
instructions
very
necessary
to
be
perused
by
modern
*NL*
critics
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
it
is
impossible
we
should
know
what
sort
of
person
thou
wilt
*NL*
be
;
for
,
perhaps
,
thou
may
`
st
be
as
learned
in
human
nature
as
*NL*
Shakespear
himself
was
,
and
,
perhaps
,
thou
may
`
st
be
no
wiser
than
*NL*
some
of
his
editors
.
Now
,
lest
this
latter
should
be
the
case
,
we
*NL*
think
proper
,
before
we
go
any
farther
together
,
to
give
thee
a
few
*NL*
wholesome
admonitions
;
that
thou
may
`
st
not
as
grossly
misunderstand
*NL*
and
misrepresent
us
,
as
some
of
the
said
editors
have
misunderstood
*NL*
and
misrepresented
their
author
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
then
,
we
warn
thee
not
too
hastily
to
condemn
any
of
the
*NL*
incidents
in
this
our
history
as
impertinent
and
foreign
to
our
main
*NL*
design
,
because
thou
dost
not
immediately
conceive
in
what
manner
such
*NL*
incident
may
conduce
to
that
design
.
This
work
may
,
indeed
,
be
*NL*
considered
as
a
great
creation
of
our
own
;
and
for
a
little
reptile
of
*NL*
a
critic
to
presume
to
find
fault
with
any
of
its
parts
,
without
*NL*
knowing
the
manner
in
which
the
whole
is
connected
,
and
before
he
*NL*
comes
to
the
final
catastrophe
,
is
a
most
presumptuous
absurdity
.
The
*NL*
allusion
and
metaphor
we
have
here
made
use
of
,
we
must
acknowledge
to
*NL*
be
infinitely
too
great
for
our
occasion
;
but
there
is
,
indeed
,
no
*NL*
other
,
which
is
at
all
adequate
to
express
the
difference
between
an
*NL*
author
of
the
first
rate
and
a
critic
of
the
lowest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
caution
we
would
give
thee
,
my
good
reptile
,
is
,
that
thou
*NL*
dost
not
find
out
too
near
a
resemblance
between
certain
characters
*NL*
here
introduced
;
as
,
for
instance
,
between
the
landlady
who
appears
in
*NL*
the
seventh
book
and
her
in
the
ninth
.
Thou
art
to
know
,
friend
,
that
*NL*
there
are
certain
characteristics
in
which
most
individuals
of
every
*NL*
profession
and
occupation
agree
.
To
be
able
to
preserve
these
*NL*
characteristics
,
and
at
the
same
time
to
diversify
their
operations
,
*NL*
is
one
talent
of
a
good
writer
.
Again
,
to
mark
the
nice
distinction
*NL*
between
two
persons
actuated
by
the
same
vice
or
folly
is
another
;
*NL*
and
,
as
this
last
talent
is
found
in
very
few
writers
,
so
is
the
true
*NL*
discernment
of
it
found
in
as
few
readers
;
though
,
I
believe
,
the
*NL*
observation
of
this
forms
a
very
principal
pleasure
in
those
who
are
*NL*
capable
of
the
discovery
;
every
person
,
for
instance
,
can
distinguish
*NL*
between
Sir
Epicure
Mammon
and
Sir
Fopling
Flutter
;
but
to
note
the
*NL*
difference
between
Sir
Fopling
Flutter
and
Sir
Courtly
Nice
requires
a
*NL*
more
exquisite
judgment
:
for
want
of
which
,
vulgar
spectators
of
plays
*NL*
very
often
do
great
injustice
in
the
theatre
;
where
I
have
sometimes
*NL*
known
a
poet
in
danger
of
being
convicted
as
a
thief
,
upon
much
worse
*NL*
evidence
than
the
resemblance
of
hands
hath
been
held
to
be
in
the
*NL*
law
.
In
reality
,
I
apprehend
every
amorous
widow
on
the
stage
would
*NL*
run
the
hazard
of
being
condemned
as
a
servile
imitation
of
Dido
,
but
*NL*
that
happily
very
few
of
our
play-house
critics
understand
enough
of
*NL*
Latin
to
read
Virgil
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
next
place
,
we
must
admonish
thee
,
my
worthy
friend
-LRB-
for
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
thy
heart
may
be
better
than
thy
head
-RRB-
,
not
to
condemn
a
*NL*
character
as
a
bad
one
,
because
it
is
not
perfectly
a
good
one
.
If
*NL*
thou
dost
delight
in
these
models
of
perfection
,
there
are
books
enow
*NL*
written
to
gratify
thy
taste
;
but
,
as
we
have
not
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
our
conversation
,
ever
happened
to
meet
with
any
such
person
,
we
have
*NL*
not
chosen
to
introduce
any
such
here
.
To
say
the
truth
,
I
a
little
*NL*
question
whether
mere
man
ever
arrived
at
this
consummate
degree
of
*NL*
excellence
,
as
well
as
whether
there
hath
ever
existed
a
monster
bad
*NL*
enough
to
verify
that
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
nulla
virtute
redemptum
*NL*
A
vitiis
_
--
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
Whose
vices
are
not
allayed
with
a
single
virtue
*NL*
*NL*
in
Juvenal
;
nor
do
I
,
indeed
,
conceive
the
good
purposes
served
by
*NL*
inserting
characters
of
such
angelic
perfection
,
or
such
diabolical
*NL*
depravity
,
in
any
work
of
invention
;
since
,
from
contemplating
either
,
*NL*
the
mind
of
man
is
more
likely
to
be
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
and
shame
*NL*
than
to
draw
any
good
uses
from
such
patterns
;
for
in
the
former
*NL*
instance
he
may
be
both
concerned
and
ashamed
to
see
a
pattern
of
*NL*
excellence
in
his
nature
,
which
he
may
reasonably
despair
of
ever
*NL*
arriving
at
;
and
in
contemplating
the
latter
he
may
be
no
less
*NL*
affected
with
those
uneasy
sensations
,
at
seeing
the
nature
of
which
*NL*
he
is
a
partaker
degraded
into
so
odious
and
detestable
a
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
if
there
be
enough
of
goodness
in
a
character
to
engage
the
*NL*
admiration
and
affection
of
a
well-disposed
mind
,
though
there
should
*NL*
appear
some
of
those
little
blemishes
_
quas
humana
parum
cavit
*NL*
natura
_
,
they
will
raise
our
compassion
rather
than
our
abhorrence
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
nothing
can
be
of
more
moral
use
than
the
imperfections
which
*NL*
are
seen
in
examples
of
this
kind
;
since
such
form
a
kind
of
surprize
,
*NL*
more
apt
to
affect
and
dwell
upon
our
minds
than
the
faults
of
very
*NL*
vicious
and
wicked
persons
.
The
foibles
and
vices
of
men
,
in
whom
*NL*
there
is
great
mixture
of
good
,
become
more
glaring
objects
from
the
*NL*
virtues
which
contrast
them
and
shew
their
deformity
;
and
when
we
find
*NL*
such
vices
attended
with
their
evil
consequence
to
our
favourite
*NL*
characters
,
we
are
not
only
taught
to
shun
them
for
our
own
sake
,
but
*NL*
to
hate
them
for
the
mischiefs
they
have
already
brought
on
those
we
*NL*
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
my
friend
,
having
given
you
these
few
admonitions
,
we
will
,
*NL*
if
you
please
,
once
more
set
forward
with
our
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
ii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
the
arrival
of
an
Irish
gentleman
,
with
very
extraordinary
*NL*
adventures
which
ensued
at
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
little
trembling
hare
,
which
the
dread
of
all
her
numerous
*NL*
enemies
,
and
chiefly
of
that
cunning
,
cruel
,
carnivorous
animal
,
man
,
*NL*
had
confined
all
the
day
to
her
lurking-place
,
sports
wantonly
o'er
*NL*
the
lawns
;
now
on
some
hollow
tree
the
owl
,
shrill
chorister
of
the
*NL*
night
,
hoots
forth
notes
which
might
charm
the
ears
of
some
modern
*NL*
connoisseurs
in
music
;
now
,
in
the
imagination
of
the
half-drunk
*NL*
clown
,
as
he
staggers
through
the
churchyard
,
or
rather
charnelyard
,
*NL*
to
his
home
,
fear
paints
the
bloody
hobgoblin
;
now
thieves
and
*NL*
ruffians
are
awake
,
and
honest
watchmen
fast
asleep
;
in
plain
English
,
*NL*
it
was
now
midnight
;
and
the
company
at
the
inn
,
as
well
those
who
*NL*
have
been
already
mentioned
in
this
history
,
as
some
others
who
*NL*
arrived
in
the
evening
,
were
all
in
bed
.
Only
Susan
Chambermaid
was
*NL*
now
stirring
,
she
being
obliged
to
wash
the
kitchen
before
she
retired
*NL*
to
the
arms
of
the
fond
expecting
hostler
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
posture
were
affairs
at
the
inn
when
a
gentleman
arrived
there
*NL*
post
.
He
immediately
alighted
from
his
horse
,
and
,
coming
up
to
Susan
,
*NL*
enquired
of
her
,
in
a
very
abrupt
and
confused
manner
,
being
almost
*NL*
out
of
breath
with
eagerness
,
Whether
there
was
any
lady
in
the
house
?
*NL*
The
hour
of
night
,
and
the
behaviour
of
the
man
,
who
stared
very
*NL*
wildly
all
the
time
,
a
little
surprized
Susan
,
so
that
she
hesitated
*NL*
before
she
made
any
answer
;
upon
which
the
gentleman
,
with
redoubled
*NL*
eagerness
,
begged
her
to
give
him
a
true
information
,
saying
,
He
had
*NL*
lost
his
wife
,
and
was
come
in
pursuit
of
her
.
``
Upon
my
shoul
,
''
cries
*NL*
he
,
``
I
have
been
near
catching
her
already
in
two
or
three
places
,
if
*NL*
I
had
not
found
her
gone
just
as
I
came
up
with
her
.
If
she
be
in
the
*NL*
house
,
do
carry
me
up
in
the
dark
and
show
her
to
me
;
and
if
she
be
*NL*
gone
away
before
me
,
do
tell
me
which
way
I
shall
go
after
her
to
meet
*NL*
her
,
and
,
upon
my
shoul
,
I
will
make
you
the
richest
poor
woman
in
the
*NL*
nation
.
''
He
then
pulled
out
a
handful
of
guineas
,
a
sight
which
would
*NL*
have
bribed
persons
of
much
greater
consequence
than
this
poor
wench
*NL*
to
much
worse
purposes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
,
from
the
account
she
had
received
of
Mrs
Waters
,
made
not
the
*NL*
least
doubt
but
that
she
was
the
very
identical
stray
whom
the
right
*NL*
owner
pursued
.
As
she
concluded
,
therefore
,
with
great
appearance
of
*NL*
reason
,
that
she
never
could
get
money
in
an
honester
way
than
by
*NL*
restoring
a
wife
to
her
husband
,
she
made
no
scruple
of
assuring
the
*NL*
gentleman
that
the
lady
he
wanted
was
then
in
the
house
;
and
was
*NL*
presently
afterwards
prevailed
upon
-LRB-
by
very
liberal
promises
,
and
*NL*
some
earnest
paid
into
her
hands
-RRB-
to
conduct
him
to
the
bedchamber
of
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
hath
been
a
custom
long
established
in
the
polite
world
,
and
that
*NL*
upon
very
solid
and
substantial
reasons
,
that
a
husband
shall
never
*NL*
enter
his
wife
's
apartment
without
first
knocking
at
the
door
.
The
*NL*
many
excellent
uses
of
this
custom
need
scarce
be
hinted
to
a
reader
*NL*
who
hath
any
knowledge
of
the
world
;
for
by
this
means
the
lady
hath
*NL*
time
to
adjust
herself
,
or
to
remove
any
disagreeable
object
out
of
*NL*
the
way
;
for
there
are
some
situations
in
which
nice
and
delicate
*NL*
women
would
not
be
discovered
by
their
husbands
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
there
are
several
ceremonies
instituted
among
the
*NL*
polished
part
of
mankind
,
which
,
though
they
may
,
to
coarser
*NL*
judgments
,
appear
as
matters
of
mere
form
,
are
found
to
have
much
of
*NL*
substance
in
them
,
by
the
more
discerning
;
and
lucky
would
it
have
*NL*
been
had
the
custom
above
mentioned
been
observed
by
our
gentleman
in
*NL*
the
present
instance
.
Knock
,
indeed
,
he
did
at
the
door
,
but
not
with
*NL*
one
of
those
gentle
raps
which
is
usual
on
such
occasions
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
when
he
found
the
door
locked
,
he
flew
at
it
with
such
*NL*
violence
,
that
the
lock
immediately
gave
way
,
the
door
burst
open
,
and
*NL*
he
fell
headlong
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
sooner
recovered
his
legs
than
forth
from
the
bed
,
upon
his
*NL*
legs
likewise
,
appeared
--
with
shame
and
sorrow
are
we
obliged
to
*NL*
proceed
--
our
heroe
himself
,
who
,
with
a
menacing
voice
,
demanded
of
*NL*
the
gentleman
who
he
was
,
and
what
he
meant
by
daring
to
burst
open
*NL*
his
chamber
in
that
outrageous
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman
at
first
thought
he
had
committed
a
mistake
,
and
was
*NL*
going
to
ask
pardon
and
retreat
,
when
,
on
a
sudden
,
as
the
moon
shone
*NL*
very
bright
,
he
cast
his
eyes
on
stays
,
gowns
,
petticoats
,
caps
,
*NL*
ribbons
,
stockings
,
garters
,
shoes
,
clogs
,
&
c.
,
all
which
lay
in
a
*NL*
disordered
manner
on
the
floor
.
All
these
,
operating
on
the
natural
*NL*
jealousy
of
his
temper
,
so
enraged
him
,
that
he
lost
all
power
of
*NL*
speech
;
and
,
without
returning
any
answer
to
Jones
,
he
endeavoured
to
*NL*
approach
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
immediately
interposing
,
a
fierce
contention
arose
,
which
soon
*NL*
proceeded
to
blows
on
both
sides
.
And
now
Mrs
Waters
-LRB-
for
we
must
*NL*
confess
she
was
in
the
same
bed
-RRB-
,
being
,
I
suppose
,
awakened
from
her
*NL*
sleep
,
and
seeing
two
men
fighting
in
her
bedchamber
,
began
to
scream
*NL*
in
the
most
violent
manner
,
crying
out
murder
!
robbery
!
and
more
*NL*
frequently
rape
!
which
last
,
some
,
perhaps
,
may
wonder
she
should
*NL*
mention
,
who
do
not
consider
that
these
words
of
exclamation
are
used
*NL*
by
ladies
in
a
fright
,
as
fa
,
la
,
la
,
ra
,
da
,
&
c.
,
are
in
music
,
only
*NL*
as
the
vehicles
of
sound
,
and
without
any
fixed
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
to
the
lady
's
chamber
was
deposited
the
body
of
an
Irish
*NL*
gentleman
who
arrived
too
late
at
the
inn
to
have
been
mentioned
*NL*
before
.
This
gentleman
was
one
of
those
whom
the
Irish
call
a
*NL*
calabalaro
,
or
cavalier
.
He
was
a
younger
brother
of
a
good
family
,
*NL*
and
,
having
no
fortune
at
home
,
was
obliged
to
look
abroad
in
order
to
*NL*
get
one
;
for
which
purpose
he
was
proceeding
to
the
Bath
,
to
try
his
*NL*
luck
with
cards
and
the
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
young
fellow
lay
in
bed
reading
one
of
Mrs
Behn
's
novels
;
for
he
*NL*
had
been
instructed
by
a
friend
that
he
would
find
no
more
effectual
*NL*
method
of
recommending
himself
to
the
ladies
than
the
improving
his
*NL*
understanding
,
and
filling
his
mind
with
good
literature
.
He
no
*NL*
sooner
,
therefore
,
heard
the
violent
uproar
in
the
next
room
,
than
he
*NL*
leapt
from
his
bolster
,
and
,
taking
his
sword
in
one
hand
,
and
the
*NL*
candle
which
burnt
by
him
in
the
other
,
he
went
directly
to
Mrs
*NL*
Waters
's
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
sight
of
another
man
in
his
shirt
at
first
added
some
shock
to
*NL*
the
decency
of
the
lady
,
it
made
her
presently
amends
by
considerably
*NL*
abating
her
fears
;
for
no
sooner
had
the
calabalaro
entered
the
room
*NL*
than
he
cried
out
,
``
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
what
the
devil
is
the
maning
of
*NL*
this
?
''
Upon
which
the
other
immediately
answered
,
``
O
,
Mr
Maclachlan
!
I
*NL*
am
rejoiced
you
are
here
.
--
This
villain
hath
debauched
my
wife
,
and
is
*NL*
got
into
bed
with
her
.
''
--
``
What
wife
?
''
cries
Maclachlan
;
``
do
not
I
know
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
very
well
,
and
do
n't
I
see
that
the
lady
,
whom
the
*NL*
gentleman
who
stands
here
in
his
shirt
is
lying
in
bed
with
,
is
none
*NL*
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
,
now
perceiving
,
as
well
by
the
glimpse
he
had
of
the
*NL*
lady
,
as
by
her
voice
,
which
might
have
been
distinguished
at
a
*NL*
greater
distance
than
he
now
stood
from
her
,
that
he
had
made
a
very
*NL*
unfortunate
mistake
,
began
to
ask
many
pardons
of
the
lady
;
and
then
,
*NL*
turning
to
Jones
,
he
said
,
``
I
would
have
you
take
notice
I
do
not
ask
*NL*
your
pardon
,
for
you
have
bate
me
;
for
which
I
am
resolved
to
have
*NL*
your
blood
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
treated
this
menace
with
much
contempt
;
and
Mr
Maclachlan
*NL*
answered
,
``
Indeed
,
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
you
may
be
ashamed
of
your
own
*NL*
self
,
to
disturb
people
at
this
time
of
night
;
if
all
the
people
in
*NL*
the
inn
were
not
asleep
,
you
would
have
awakened
them
as
you
have
me
.
*NL*
The
gentleman
has
served
you
very
rightly
.
Upon
my
conscience
,
though
*NL*
I
have
no
wife
,
if
you
had
treated
her
so
,
I
would
have
cut
your
*NL*
throat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
so
confounded
with
his
fears
for
his
lady
's
reputation
,
that
*NL*
he
knew
neither
what
to
say
or
do
;
but
the
invention
of
women
is
,
as
*NL*
hath
been
observed
,
much
readier
than
that
of
men
.
She
recollected
*NL*
that
there
was
a
communication
between
her
chamber
and
that
of
Mr
*NL*
Jones
;
relying
,
therefore
,
on
his
honour
and
her
own
assurance
,
she
*NL*
answered
,
``
I
know
not
what
you
mean
,
villains
!
I
am
wife
to
none
of
*NL*
you
.
Help
!
Rape
!
Murder
!
Rape
!
''
--
And
now
,
the
landlady
coming
into
the
*NL*
room
,
Mrs
Waters
fell
upon
her
with
the
utmost
virulence
,
saying
,
``
She
*NL*
thought
herself
in
a
sober
inn
,
and
not
in
a
bawdy-house
;
but
that
a
*NL*
set
of
villains
had
broke
into
her
room
,
with
an
intent
upon
her
*NL*
honour
,
if
not
upon
her
life
;
and
both
,
she
said
,
were
equally
dear
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
now
began
to
roar
as
loudly
as
the
poor
woman
in
bed
had
*NL*
done
before
.
She
cried
,
``
She
was
undone
,
and
that
the
reputation
of
*NL*
her
house
,
which
was
never
blown
upon
before
,
was
utterly
destroyed
.
''
*NL*
Then
,
turning
to
the
men
,
she
cried
,
``
What
,
in
the
devil
's
name
,
is
*NL*
the
reason
of
all
this
disturbance
in
the
lady
's
room
?
''
Fitzpatrick
,
*NL*
hanging
down
his
head
,
repeated
,
``
That
he
had
committed
a
mistake
,
for
*NL*
which
he
heartily
asked
pardon
,
''
and
then
retired
with
his
countryman
.
*NL*
Jones
,
who
was
too
ingenious
to
have
missed
the
hint
given
him
by
his
*NL*
fair
one
,
boldly
asserted
,
``
That
he
had
run
to
her
assistance
upon
*NL*
hearing
the
door
broke
open
,
with
what
design
he
could
not
conceive
,
*NL*
unless
of
robbing
the
lady
;
which
,
if
they
intended
,
he
said
,
he
had
*NL*
the
good
fortune
to
prevent
.
''
``
I
never
had
a
robbery
committed
in
my
*NL*
house
since
I
have
kept
it
,
''
cries
the
landlady
;
``
I
would
have
you
to
*NL*
know
,
sir
,
I
harbour
no
highwaymen
here
;
I
scorn
the
word
,
thof
I
say
*NL*
it
.
None
but
honest
,
good
gentlefolks
,
are
welcome
to
my
house
;
and
,
I
*NL*
thank
good
luck
,
I
have
always
had
enow
of
such
customers
;
indeed
as
*NL*
many
as
I
could
entertain
.
Here
hath
been
my
lord
--
,
''
and
then
she
*NL*
repeated
over
a
catalogue
of
names
and
titles
,
many
of
which
we
might
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
be
guilty
of
a
breach
of
privilege
by
inserting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
after
much
patience
,
at
length
interrupted
her
,
by
making
an
*NL*
apology
to
Mrs
Waters
,
for
having
appeared
before
her
in
his
shirt
,
*NL*
assuring
her
``
That
nothing
but
a
concern
for
her
safety
could
have
*NL*
prevailed
on
him
to
do
it
.
''
The
reader
may
inform
himself
of
her
*NL*
answer
,
and
,
indeed
,
of
her
whole
behaviour
to
the
end
of
the
scene
,
*NL*
by
considering
the
situation
which
she
affected
,
it
being
that
of
a
*NL*
modest
lady
,
who
was
awakened
out
of
her
sleep
by
three
strange
men
in
*NL*
her
chamber
.
This
was
the
part
which
she
undertook
to
perform
;
and
,
*NL*
indeed
,
she
executed
it
so
well
,
that
none
of
our
theatrical
actresses
*NL*
could
exceed
her
,
in
any
of
their
performances
,
either
on
or
off
the
*NL*
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
hence
,
I
think
,
we
may
very
fairly
draw
an
argument
,
to
prove
how
*NL*
extremely
natural
virtue
is
to
the
fair
sex
;
for
,
though
there
is
not
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
one
in
ten
thousand
who
is
capable
of
making
a
good
actress
,
*NL*
and
even
among
these
we
rarely
see
two
who
are
equally
able
to
*NL*
personate
the
same
character
,
yet
this
of
virtue
they
can
all
*NL*
admirably
well
put
on
;
and
as
well
those
individuals
who
have
it
not
,
*NL*
as
those
who
possess
it
,
can
all
act
it
to
the
utmost
degree
of
*NL*
perfection
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
men
were
all
departed
,
Mrs
Waters
,
recovering
from
her
fear
,
*NL*
recovered
likewise
from
her
anger
,
and
spoke
in
much
gentler
accents
*NL*
to
the
landlady
,
who
did
not
so
readily
quit
her
concern
for
the
*NL*
reputation
of
the
house
,
in
favour
of
which
she
began
again
to
number
*NL*
the
many
great
persons
who
had
slept
under
her
roof
;
but
the
lady
*NL*
stopt
her
short
,
and
having
absolutely
acquitted
her
of
having
had
any
*NL*
share
in
the
past
disturbance
,
begged
to
be
left
to
her
repose
,
which
,
*NL*
she
said
,
she
hoped
to
enjoy
unmolested
during
the
remainder
of
the
*NL*
night
.
Upon
which
the
landlady
,
after
much
civility
and
many
*NL*
courtsies
,
took
her
leave
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
A
dialogue
between
the
landlady
and
Susan
the
chamber-maid
,
proper
to
*NL*
be
read
by
all
inn-keepers
and
their
servants
;
with
the
arrival
,
and
*NL*
affable
behaviour
of
a
beautiful
young
lady
;
which
may
teach
persons
*NL*
of
condition
how
they
may
acquire
the
love
of
the
whole
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
,
remembering
that
Susan
had
been
the
only
person
out
of
*NL*
bed
when
the
door
was
burst
open
,
resorted
presently
to
her
,
to
*NL*
enquire
into
the
first
occasion
of
the
disturbance
,
as
well
as
who
the
*NL*
strange
gentleman
was
,
and
when
and
how
he
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
related
the
whole
story
which
the
reader
knows
already
,
varying
*NL*
the
truth
only
in
some
circumstances
,
as
she
saw
convenient
,
and
*NL*
totally
concealing
the
money
which
she
had
received
.
But
whereas
her
*NL*
mistress
had
,
in
the
preface
to
her
enquiry
,
spoken
much
in
compassion
*NL*
for
the
fright
which
the
lady
had
been
in
concerning
any
intended
*NL*
depredations
on
her
virtue
,
Susan
could
not
help
endeavouring
to
quiet
*NL*
the
concern
which
her
mistress
seemed
to
be
under
on
that
account
,
by
*NL*
swearing
heartily
she
saw
Jones
leap
out
from
her
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
fell
into
a
violent
rage
at
these
words
.
``
A
likely
story
,
*NL*
truly
,
''
cried
she
,
``
that
a
woman
should
cry
out
,
and
endeavour
to
*NL*
expose
herself
,
if
that
was
the
case
!
I
desire
to
know
what
better
*NL*
proof
any
lady
can
give
of
her
virtue
than
her
crying
out
,
which
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
twenty
people
can
witness
for
her
she
did
?
I
beg
,
madam
,
you
*NL*
would
spread
no
such
scandal
of
any
of
my
guests
;
for
it
will
not
only
*NL*
reflect
on
them
,
but
upon
the
house
;
and
I
am
sure
no
vagabonds
,
nor
*NL*
wicked
beggarly
people
,
come
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
Susan
,
``
then
I
must
not
believe
my
own
eyes
.
''
``
No
,
*NL*
indeed
,
must
you
not
always
,
''
answered
her
mistress
;
``
I
would
not
have
*NL*
believed
my
own
eyes
against
such
good
gentlefolks
.
I
have
not
had
a
*NL*
better
supper
ordered
this
half-year
than
they
ordered
last
night
;
and
*NL*
so
easy
and
good-humoured
were
they
,
that
they
found
no
fault
with
my
*NL*
Worcestershire
perry
,
which
I
sold
them
for
champagne
;
and
to
be
sure
*NL*
it
is
as
well
tasted
and
as
wholesome
as
the
best
champagne
in
the
*NL*
kingdom
,
otherwise
I
would
scorn
to
give
it
'em
;
and
they
drank
me
two
*NL*
bottles
.
No
,
no
,
I
will
never
believe
any
harm
of
such
sober
good
sort
*NL*
of
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
being
thus
silenced
,
her
mistress
proceeded
to
other
matters
.
*NL*
``
And
so
you
tell
me
,
''
continued
she
,
``
that
the
strange
gentleman
came
*NL*
post
,
and
there
is
a
footman
without
with
the
horses
;
why
,
then
,
he
is
*NL*
certainly
some
of
your
great
gentlefolks
too
.
Why
did
not
you
ask
him
*NL*
whether
he
'd
have
any
supper
?
I
think
he
is
in
the
other
gentleman
's
*NL*
room
;
go
up
and
ask
whether
he
called
.
Perhaps
he
'll
order
something
*NL*
when
he
finds
anybody
stirring
in
the
house
to
dress
it
.
Now
do
n't
*NL*
commit
any
of
your
usual
blunders
,
by
telling
him
the
fire
's
out
,
and
*NL*
the
fowls
alive
.
And
if
he
should
order
mutton
,
do
n't
blab
out
that
we
*NL*
have
none
.
The
butcher
,
I
know
,
killed
a
sheep
just
before
I
went
to
*NL*
bed
,
and
he
never
refuses
to
cut
it
up
warm
when
I
desire
it
.
Go
,
*NL*
remember
there
's
all
sorts
of
mutton
and
fowls
;
go
,
open
the
door
*NL*
with
,
Gentlemen
,
d'ye
call
?
and
if
they
say
nothing
,
ask
what
his
*NL*
honour
will
be
pleased
to
have
for
supper
?
Do
n't
forget
his
honour
.
*NL*
Go
;
if
you
do
n't
mind
all
these
matters
better
,
you
'll
never
come
to
*NL*
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
departed
,
and
soon
returned
with
an
account
that
the
two
*NL*
gentlemen
were
got
both
into
the
same
bed
.
``
Two
gentlemen
,
''
says
the
*NL*
landlady
,
``
in
the
same
bed
!
that
's
impossible
;
they
are
two
arrant
*NL*
scrubs
,
I
warrant
them
;
and
I
believe
young
Squire
Allworthy
guessed
*NL*
right
,
that
the
fellow
intended
to
rob
her
ladyship
;
for
,
if
he
had
*NL*
broke
open
the
lady
's
door
with
any
of
the
wicked
designs
of
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
he
would
never
have
sneaked
away
to
another
room
to
save
*NL*
the
expense
of
a
supper
and
a
bed
to
himself
.
They
are
certainly
*NL*
thieves
,
and
their
searching
after
a
wife
is
nothing
but
a
pretence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
these
censures
my
landlady
did
Mr
Fitzpatrick
great
injustice
;
for
*NL*
he
was
really
born
a
gentleman
,
though
not
worth
a
groat
;
and
though
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
he
had
some
few
blemishes
in
his
heart
as
well
as
in
his
*NL*
head
,
yet
being
a
sneaking
or
a
niggardly
fellow
was
not
one
of
them
.
*NL*
In
reality
,
he
was
so
generous
a
man
,
that
,
whereas
he
had
received
a
*NL*
very
handsome
fortune
with
his
wife
,
he
had
now
spent
every
penny
of
*NL*
it
,
except
some
little
pittance
which
was
settled
upon
her
;
and
,
in
*NL*
order
to
possess
himself
of
this
,
he
had
used
her
with
such
cruelty
,
*NL*
that
,
together
with
his
jealousy
,
which
was
of
the
bitterest
kind
,
it
*NL*
had
forced
the
poor
woman
to
run
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gentleman
then
being
well
tired
with
his
long
journey
from
*NL*
Chester
in
one
day
,
with
which
,
and
some
good
dry
blows
he
had
*NL*
received
in
the
scuffle
,
his
bones
were
so
sore
,
that
,
added
to
the
*NL*
soreness
of
his
mind
,
it
had
quite
deprived
him
of
any
appetite
for
*NL*
eating
.
And
being
now
so
violently
disappointed
in
the
woman
whom
,
at
*NL*
the
maid
's
instance
,
he
had
mistaken
for
his
wife
,
it
never
once
*NL*
entered
into
his
head
that
she
might
nevertheless
be
in
the
house
,
*NL*
though
he
had
erred
in
the
first
person
he
had
attacked
.
He
therefore
*NL*
yielded
to
the
dissuasions
of
his
friend
from
searching
any
farther
*NL*
after
her
that
night
,
and
accepted
the
kind
offer
of
part
of
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
footman
and
post-boy
were
in
a
different
disposition
.
They
were
*NL*
more
ready
to
order
than
the
landlady
was
to
provide
;
however
,
after
*NL*
being
pretty
well
satisfied
by
them
of
the
real
truth
of
the
case
,
and
*NL*
that
Mr
Fitzpatrick
was
no
thief
,
she
was
at
length
prevailed
on
to
*NL*
set
some
cold
meat
before
them
,
which
they
were
devouring
with
great
*NL*
greediness
,
when
Partridge
came
into
the
kitchen
.
He
had
been
first
*NL*
awaked
by
the
hurry
which
we
have
before
seen
;
and
while
he
was
*NL*
endeavouring
to
compose
himself
again
on
his
pillow
,
a
screech-owl
had
*NL*
given
him
such
a
serenade
at
his
window
,
that
he
leapt
in
a
most
*NL*
horrible
affright
from
his
bed
,
and
,
huddling
on
his
cloaths
with
*NL*
great
expedition
,
ran
down
to
the
protection
of
the
company
,
whom
he
*NL*
heard
talking
below
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
arrival
detained
my
landlady
from
returning
to
her
rest
;
for
she
*NL*
was
just
about
to
leave
the
other
two
guests
to
the
care
of
Susan
;
but
*NL*
the
friend
of
young
Squire
Allworthy
was
not
to
be
so
neglected
,
*NL*
especially
as
he
called
for
a
pint
of
wine
to
be
mulled
.
She
*NL*
immediately
obeyed
,
by
putting
the
same
quantity
of
perry
to
the
fire
;
*NL*
for
this
readily
answered
to
the
name
of
every
kind
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Irish
footman
was
retired
to
bed
,
and
the
post-boy
was
going
to
*NL*
follow
;
but
Partridge
invited
him
to
stay
and
partake
of
his
wine
,
*NL*
which
the
lad
very
thankfully
accepted
.
The
schoolmaster
was
indeed
*NL*
afraid
to
return
to
bed
by
himself
;
and
as
he
did
not
know
how
soon
he
*NL*
might
lose
the
company
of
my
landlady
,
he
was
resolved
to
secure
that
*NL*
of
the
boy
,
in
whose
presence
he
apprehended
no
danger
from
the
devil
*NL*
or
any
of
his
adherents
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
arrived
another
post-boy
at
the
gate
;
upon
which
Susan
,
being
*NL*
ordered
out
,
returned
,
introducing
two
young
women
in
riding
habits
,
*NL*
one
of
which
was
so
very
richly
laced
,
that
Partridge
and
the
post-boy
*NL*
instantly
started
from
their
chairs
,
and
my
landlady
fell
to
her
*NL*
courtsies
,
and
her
ladyships
,
with
great
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
in
the
rich
habit
said
,
with
a
smile
of
great
condescension
,
*NL*
``
If
you
will
give
me
leave
,
madam
,
I
will
warm
myself
a
few
minutes
at
*NL*
your
kitchen
fire
,
for
it
is
really
very
cold
;
but
I
must
insist
on
*NL*
disturbing
no
one
from
his
seat
.
''
This
was
spoken
on
account
of
*NL*
Partridge
,
who
had
retreated
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
struck
with
*NL*
the
utmost
awe
and
astonishment
at
the
splendor
of
the
lady
's
dress
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
she
had
a
much
better
title
to
respect
than
this
;
for
she
was
*NL*
one
of
the
most
beautiful
creatures
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
earnestly
desired
Partridge
to
return
to
his
seat
;
but
could
*NL*
not
prevail
.
She
then
pulled
off
her
gloves
,
and
displayed
to
the
fire
*NL*
two
hands
,
which
had
every
property
of
snow
in
them
,
except
that
of
*NL*
melting
.
Her
companion
,
who
was
indeed
her
maid
,
likewise
pulled
off
*NL*
her
gloves
,
and
discovered
what
bore
an
exact
resemblance
,
in
cold
and
*NL*
colour
,
to
a
piece
of
frozen
beef
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
,
madam
,
''
quoth
the
latter
,
``
your
ladyship
would
not
think
of
*NL*
going
any
farther
to-night
.
I
am
terribly
afraid
your
ladyship
will
*NL*
not
be
able
to
bear
the
fatigue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
sure
,
''
cries
the
landlady
,
``
her
ladyship
's
honour
can
never
*NL*
intend
it
.
O
,
bless
me
!
farther
to-night
,
indeed
!
let
me
beseech
your
*NL*
ladyship
not
to
think
o
n't
--
But
,
to
be
sure
,
your
ladyship
ca
n't
.
*NL*
What
will
your
honour
be
pleased
to
have
for
supper
?
I
have
mutton
of
*NL*
all
kinds
,
and
some
nice
chicken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
madam
,
''
said
the
lady
,
``
it
would
be
rather
breakfast
than
*NL*
supper
;
but
I
ca
n't
eat
anything
;
and
,
if
I
stay
,
shall
only
lie
down
*NL*
for
an
hour
or
two
.
However
,
if
you
please
,
madam
,
you
may
get
me
a
*NL*
little
sack
whey
,
made
very
small
and
thin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madam
,
''
cries
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
``
I
have
some
excellent
*NL*
white
wine
.
''
--
``
You
have
no
sack
,
then
?
''
says
the
lady
.
``
Yes
,
a
n't
*NL*
please
your
honour
,
I
have
;
I
may
challenge
the
country
for
that
--
but
*NL*
let
me
beg
your
ladyship
to
eat
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
I
ca
n't
eat
a
morsel
,
''
answered
the
lady
;
``
and
I
shall
*NL*
be
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
will
please
to
get
my
apartment
ready
as

soon
as
possible

for
I
am
resolved
to
be
on
horseback
again
in
three
*NL*
hours

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Susan
,
''
cries
the
landlady
,
``
is
there
a
fire
lit
yet
in
the
*NL*
Wild-goose
?
I
am
sorry
,
madam
,
all
my
best
rooms
are
full
.
Several
*NL*
people
of
the
first
quality
are
now
in
bed
.
Here
's
a
great
young
*NL*
squire
,
and
many
other
great
gentlefolks
of
quality

Susan
answered
,
*NL*
``
That
the
Irish
gentlemen
were
got
into
the
Wild-goose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
ever
anything
like
it
?

says
the
mistress
;
``
why
the
devil
would
*NL*
you
not
keep
some
of
the
best
rooms
for
the
quality
,
when
you
know
*NL*
scarce
a
day
passes
without
some
calling
here
?
--
If
they
be
*NL*
gentlemen
,
I
am
certain
,
when
they
know
it
is
for
her
ladyship
,
they
*NL*
will
get
up
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
upon
my
account
,
''
says
the
lady
;
``
I
will
have
no
person
disturbed
*NL*
for
me
.
If
you
have
a
room
that
is
commonly
decent

it
will
serve
me
*NL*
very
well
,
though
it
be
never
so
plain
.
I
beg
,
madam

you
will
not
*NL*
give
yourself
so
much
trouble
on
my
account

''
``
O

madam
!
''
cries
the
*NL*
other
,
``
I
have
several
very
good
rooms
for
that
matter

none
good
*NL*
enough

However
,
as
you
are
so
*NL*
condescending
to
take
up
with
the
best
I
have
,
do
,
Susan
,
get
a
fire
*NL*
in
the
Rose
this
minute
.
Will
your

be
pleased
to
go
up
now
,
*NL*
or
stay
till
the
fire
is
lighted

``
I
think
I
have
sufficiently
warmed
*NL*
myself
,

answered
the
lady
;
``
so
,
if
you
please
,
I
will
go
now
;
I
am
*NL*
afraid
I
have
kept
people
,
and
particularly
that
gentleman
-LRB-
meaning
*NL*
Partridge
-RRB-
,
too
long
in
the
cold
already
.
Indeed
,
I
can
not
bear
to
*NL*
think
of
keeping
any
person
from
the
fire
this
dreadful
weather
.
''
--
She
*NL*
then
departed
with
her
maid
,
the
landlady
marching
with
two
lighted
*NL*
candles
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
that
good
woman
returned
,
the
conversation
in
the
kitchen
was
all
*NL*
upon
the
charms
of
the
young
lady
.
There
is
indeed
in
perfect
beauty
a
*NL*
power
which
none
almost
can
withstand
;
for
my
landlady
,
though
she
was
*NL*
not
pleased
at
the
negative
given
to
the
supper
,
declared
she
had
*NL*
never
seen
so
lovely
a
creature
.
Partridge
ran
out
into
the
most
*NL*
extravagant
encomiums
on
her
face
,
though
he
could
not
refrain
from
*NL*
paying
some
compliments
to
the
gold
lace
on
her
habit
;
the
post-boy
*NL*
sung
forth
the
praises
of
her
goodness
,
which
were
likewise
echoed
by
*NL*
the
other
post-boy
,
who
was
now
come
in
.
``
She
's
a
true
good
lady
,
I
*NL*
warrant
her
,
''
says
he
;
``
for
she
hath
mercy
upon

*NL*
she
asked
me
every
now
and
tan
upon
the
journey
,
if
I
did
not
think
*NL*
she
should
hurt
the
horses
by
riding
too
fast
?
and
when
she
came
in
*NL*
she
charged
me
to
give
them
as
much
corn
as
ever
they
would
eat

*NL*
Such
charms
are
there
in
affability
,
and
so
sure
is
it
to
attract
the
*NL*
praises
of
all
kinds
of
people
.
It
may
indeed
be
compared
to
the
*NL*
celebrated
Mrs
Hussey
.
-LSB-

-RSB-
It
is
equally
sure
to
set
off
every
female
*NL*
perfection
to
the
highest
advantage
,
and
to
palliate
and
conceal
every
*NL*
defect

A
short
reflection
,
which
we
could
not
forbear
making
in
this
*NL*
place
,
where
my
reader
hath
seen
the
loveliness
of
an
affable
*NL*
deportment
;
and
truth
will
now
oblige
us
to
contrast
it
,
by
showing
*NL*
the
reverse

disesteem

*NL*
The
lady
had
no
sooner
laid
herself
on
her
pillow
than
the
*NL*
waiting-woman
returned
to
the
kitchen
to
regale
with
some
of
those
*NL*
dainties
which
her
mistress
had
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
,
at
her
entrance
,
shewed
her
the
same
respect
which
they
*NL*
had
before
paid
to
her
mistress
,
by
rising
;
but
she
forgot
to
imitate
*NL*
her
,
by
desiring
them
to
sit
down
again
.
Indeed
,
it
was
scarce
*NL*
possible
they
should
have
done
so
,
for
she
placed
her
chair
in
such
a
*NL*
posture
as
to
occupy
almost
the
whole
fire
.
She
then
ordered
a
chicken
*NL*
to
be
broiled
that
instant
,
declaring
,
if
it
was
not
ready
in
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
,
she
would
not
stay
for
it
.
Now
,
though
the
said
*NL*
chicken
was
then
at
roost
in
the
stable
,
and
required
the
several
*NL*
ceremonies
of
catching
,
killing
,
and
picking
,
before
it
was
brought
to
*NL*
the
gridiron
,
my
landlady
would
nevertheless
have
undertaken
to
do
all
*NL*
within
the
time
;
but
the
guest
,
being
unfortunately
admitted
behind
*NL*
the
scenes
,
must
have
been
witness
to
the
_
fourberie
_
;
the
poor
woman
*NL*
was
therefore
obliged
to
confess
that
she
had
none
in
the
house
;
``
but
,
*NL*
madam
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
can
get
any
kind
of
mutton
in
an
instant
from
the
*NL*
butcher
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
,
then
,
''
answered
the
waiting-gentlewoman
,
``
that
I
have
*NL*
the
stomach
of
a
horse
,
to
eat
mutton
at
this
time
of
night
?
Sure
you
*NL*
people
that
keep
inns
imagine
your
betters
are
like
yourselves
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
expected
to
get
nothing
at
this
wretched
place
.
I
wonder
my
*NL*
lady
would
stop
at
it
.
I
suppose
none
but
tradesmen
and
grasiers
ever
*NL*
call
here
.
''
The
landlady
fired
at
this
indignity
offered
to
her
house
;
*NL*
however
,
she
suppressed
her
temper
,
and
contented
herself
with
saying
,
*NL*
``
Very
good
quality
frequented
it
,
she
thanked
heaven
!
''
``
Do
n't
tell
*NL*
me
,
''
cries
the
other
,
``

I
believe
I
know
more
of

quality

such
as
you

--
But
,
prithee
,
without
troubling
me
with
any
*NL*
of
your
impertinence
,
do
tell
me
what
I
can
have
for
supper
;
for
,
*NL*
though
I
can
not
eat
horse-flesh
,
I
am
really
hungry
.
''
``
Why
,
truly
,
*NL*
madam
,
''
answered
the
landlady
,
``
you
could
not
take
me
again
at
such
a
*NL*
disadvantage
;
for
I
must
confess
I
have
nothing
in
the
house
,
unless
a
*NL*
cold
piece
of
beef
,
which
indeed
a
gentleman
's
footman
and
the
*NL*
post-boy
have
almost
cleared
to
the
bone

''
``
Woman
,
''
said
Mrs
Abigail
*NL*
-LRB-
so
for
shortness
we
will
call
her
-RRB-
,
``
I
entreat
you
not
to
make
me
*NL*
sick
.
If
I
had
fasted
a
month
,
I
could
not
eat
what
had
been
touched
*NL*
by
the
fingers
of
such
fellows
.
Is
there
nothing
neat
or
decent
to
be
*NL*
had
in
this
horrid
place
?
''
``
What
think
you
of
some
eggs
and
bacon
,
*NL*
madam
?
''
said
the
landlady
.
``
Are
your
eggs
new
laid
?
are
you
certain
*NL*
they
were
laid
to-day
?
and
let
me
have
the
bacon
cut
very
nice
and
*NL*
thin
;
for
I
ca
n't
endure
anything
that
's
gross
.
--
Prithee
try
if
you
*NL*
can
do
a
little
tolerably
for
once
,
and
do
n't
think
you
have

*NL*
farmer
's
wife
,
or
some
of
those
creatures
,
in
the
house
.
''
--
The
*NL*
landlady
began
then
to
handle
her
knife
;
but
the
other
stopt
her
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
Good
woman
,
I
must
insist
upon
your
first
washing
your
hands
;
*NL*
for
I
am
extremely
nice
,
and
have
been
always
used
from
my
cradle
to
*NL*
have
everything
in
the
most
elegant
manner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
,
who
governed
herself
with
much
difficulty
,
began
now
the
*NL*
necessary
preparations
;
for
as
to
Susan
,
she
was
utterly
rejected
,
and
*NL*
with
such
disdain
,
that
the
poor
wench
was
as
hard
put
to
it
to
*NL*
restrain
her
hands
from
violence
as
her
mistress
had
been
to
hold
her
*NL*
tongue
.
This
indeed
Susan
did
not
entirely
;
for
,
though
she
literally
*NL*
kept
it
within
her
teeth
,
yet
there
it
muttered
many
``
marry-come-ups
,
*NL*
as
good
flesh
and
blood
as
yourself
;
''
with
other
such
indignant
*NL*
phrases
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
supper
was
preparing
,
Mrs
Abigail
began
to
lament
she
had
*NL*
not
ordered
a
fire
in
the
parlour
;
but
,
she
said
,
that
was
now
too
*NL*
late
.
``
However
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
have
novelty
to
recommend
a
kitchen
;
for
*NL*
I
do
not
believe
I
ever
eat
in
one
before
.
''
Then
,
turning
to
the
*NL*
post-boys
,
she
asked
them
,
``
Why
they
were
not
in
the
stable
with
their
*NL*
horses
?
If
I
must
eat
my
hard
fare
here
,
madam
,
''
cries
she
to
the
*NL*
landlady
,
``
I
beg
the
kitchen
may
be
kept
clear
,
that
I
may
not
be
*NL*
surrounded
with
all
the
blackguards
in
town
:
as
for
you
,
sir
,
''
says
*NL*
she
to
Partridge
,
``
you
look
somewhat
like
a
gentleman
,
and
may
sit
*NL*
still
if
you
please
;
I
do
n't
desire
to
disturb
anybody
but
mob
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
madam
,
''
cries
Partridge
,
``
I
am
a
gentleman
,
I
do
assure
*NL*
you
,
and
I
am
not
so
easily
to
be
disturbed
.
_
Non
semper

casualis
*NL*
est

_
.
''
This
Latin
she
took
to
be
some
affront
,
and
*NL*
answered
,
``
You
may
be
a
gentleman
,
sir
;
but
you
do
n't
show
yourself
as
*NL*
one
to
talk
Latin
to
a
woman
.
''
Partridge
made
a
gentle
reply
,
and
*NL*
concluded
with
more
Latin
;
upon
which
she
tossed
up
her
nose
,
and
*NL*
contented
herself
by
abusing
him
with
the
name
of
a
great
scholar
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
supper
being
now
on
the
table
,
Mrs
Abigail
eat
very
heartily
for
*NL*
so
delicate
a
person
;
and
,
while
a
second
course
of
the
same
was
by
*NL*
her
order
preparing
,
she
said
,
``
And
so
,
madam
,
you
tell
me
your
house
*NL*
is
frequented
by
people
of
great
quality
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
saying
,
``
There
were
a
great
*NL*
many
very
good
quality
and
gentlefolks
in
it
now
.
There
's
young
Squire
*NL*
Allworthy
,
as
that
gentleman
there
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
pray
who
is
this
young
gentleman
of
quality
,
this
young
Squire
*NL*
Allworthy
?
''
said
Abigail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
should
he
be
,
''
answered
Partridge
,
``
but
the
son
and
heir
of
the
*NL*
great
Squire
Allworthy
,
of
Somersetshire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
tell
me
strange
news
;
for
I
know
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
of
Somersetshire
very
well
,
and
I
know
he
hath
no
son
*NL*
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
pricked
up
her
ears
at
this
,
and
Partridge
looked
a
*NL*
little
confounded
.
However
,
after
a
short
hesitation
,
he
answered
,
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
it
is
true
,
everybody
doth
not
know
him
to
be
Squire
*NL*
Allworthy
's
son
;
for
he
was
never
married
to
his
mother
;
but
his
son
*NL*
he
certainly
is
,
and
will
be
his
heir
too
,
as
certainly
as
his
name
is
*NL*
Jones
.
''
At
that
word
,
Abigail
let
drop
the
bacon
which
she
was
*NL*
conveying
to
her
mouth
,
and
cried
out
,
``
You
surprize
me
,
sir
!
Is
it
*NL*
possible
Mr
Jones
should
be
now
in
the
house
?
''
''
_
Quare
non
?
_
''
answered
*NL*
Partridge
,
``
it
is
possible
,
and
it
is
certain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Abigail
now
made
haste
to
finish
the
remainder
of
her
meal
,
and
then
*NL*
repaired
back
to
her
mistress
,
when
the
conversation
passed
which
may
*NL*
be
read
in
the
next
chapter

diffuses
her

the

perched
on
some

sits
meditating
on

so
,
looking
a

charms
and
*NL*
breathing
as
many
sweets
,
her
thoughts
being
fixed
on
her
Tommy
,
with
*NL*
a
heart
as
good
and
innocent
as
her
face
was
beautiful
,
Sophia
-LRB-
for
it
*NL*
was
she
herself
-RRB-
lay
reclining
her
lovely
head
on
her
hand
,
when
her
*NL*
maid
entered
the
room
,
and
,
running
directly
to
the
bed
,
cried
,
*NL*
``
Madam
--

--
who
doth
your
ladyship
think
is
in

house

Sophia
,
*NL*
starting
up
,
cried
,
``
I
hope
my

hath
not
overtaken
us

''
``
No

it
is
one
worth

is
here
at

this
very
instant

``
Mr
Jones

''
says
Sophia
,
``
it
is
impossible

I
*NL*
can
not
be
so
fortunate

Her
maid
averred
the
fact
,
and
was
presently
*NL*
detached
by
her
mistress
to
order
him
to
be
called
;
for
she
said
she
*NL*
was
resolved
to
see
him
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
had
no
sooner
left
the
kitchen
in
the
manner
we
have
before
*NL*
seen
than
the
landlady
fell
severely
upon
her
.
The
poor
woman
had
*NL*
indeed
been
loading
her
heart
with
foul
language
for
some
time
,
and
*NL*
now
it
scoured
out
of
her
mouth
,
as
filth
doth
from
a
mud-cart
,
when
*NL*
the
board
which
confines
it
is
removed
.
Partridge
likewise
shovelled
*NL*
in
his
share
of
calumny
,
and
-LRB-
what
may
surprize
the
reader
-RRB-
not
only
*NL*
bespattered
the
maid
,
but
attempted
to
sully
the
lily-white
character
*NL*
of
Sophia
herself
.
``
Never
a
barrel

better
herring
,
''
cries
he
,
*NL*
''
_
Noscitur

,
is
a
true
saying
.
It
must
be
confessed
,
indeed
,
*NL*
that
the
lady
in
the
fine
garments
is
the
civiller
of
the
two
;
but
I
*NL*
warrant
neither
of
them
are
a
bit
better
than
they
should
be
.
A
couple
*NL*
of
Bath
trulls
,
I
'll
answer
for
them
;
your
quality
do
n't
ride
about
at

this
time

night
without
servants

``
Sbodlikins
,
and
that
's
true
,
''
*NL*
cries
the
landlady
,
``
you
have
certainly
hit
upon
the
very
matter

for

quality

n't

a
supper

whether

they
eat

no

''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
thus
discoursing
,
Mrs
Honour
returned
and
discharged
*NL*
her
commission
,
by
bidding
the
landlady
immediately
wake
Mr
Jones
,
and
*NL*
tell
him
a
lady
wanted
to
speak
with
him
.
The
landlady
referred
her
to
*NL*
Partridge
,
saying
,
``
he
was
the
squire
's
friend
:
but
,
for
her
part
,
she
*NL*
never
called
men-folks
,
especially
gentlemen
,
''
and
then
walked
*NL*
sullenly
out
of
the
kitchen
.
Honour
applied
herself
to
Partridge
;
but
*NL*
he
refused
,
``
for
my
friend
,
''
cries
he
,
``
went
to
bed
very
late
,
and
he
*NL*
would
be
very
angry
to
be
disturbed
so
soon
.
''
Mrs
Honour
insisted
*NL*
still
to
have
him
called
,
saying
,
``
she
was
sure
,
instead

angry

that

be

the
highest
degree
delighted
when
he
knew
*NL*
the
occasion
.
''
``
Another
time
,
perhaps
,
he
might

''
cries
Partridge
;
*NL*
``
but
_
non

.
One
woman
is
enough
at
once
for

reasonable

``
What
do
you
mean
by
one
woman
,
fellow
?
''
cries
*NL*
Honour
.
``
None
of
your
fellow

''
answered
Partridge
.
He
then
proceeded
*NL*
to
inform
her
plainly
that
Jones
was
in
bed
with
a
wench
,
and
made
use
*NL*
of
an
expression
too
indelicate
to
be
here
inserted
;
which
so
enraged
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
,
that
she
called
him
jackanapes
,
and
returned
in
a
violent
*NL*
hurry
to
her
mistress
,
whom
she
acquainted
with
the
success
of
her
*NL*
errand
,
and
with
the
account
she
had
received
;
which
,
if
possible
,
she
*NL*
exaggerated
,
being
as
angry
with
Jones
as
if
he
had
pronounced
all
the
*NL*
words
that
came
from
the
mouth
of
Partridge
.
She
discharged
a
torrent
*NL*
of
abuse
on
the
master
,
and
advised
her
mistress
to
quit
all
thoughts
*NL*
of
a
man
who
had
never
shown
himself
deserving
of
her
.
She
then
ripped
*NL*
up
the
story
of
Molly
Seagrim
,
and
gave
the
most
malicious
turn
to
his
*NL*
formerly
quitting
Sophia
herself
;
which
,
I
must
confess
,
the
present
*NL*
incident
not
a
little
countenanced
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirits
of
Sophia
were
too
much
dissipated
by
concern
to
enable
*NL*
her
to
stop
the
torrent
of
her
maid
.
At
last
,
however
,
she
interrupted
*NL*
her
,
saying
,
``
I
never
can
believe
this
;
some
villain
hath
belied
him
.
*NL*
You
say
you
had
it
from
his
friend
;
but
surely
it
is
not
the
office
of
*NL*
a
friend
to
betray
such
secrets
.
''
``
I
suppose
,
''
cries
Honour
,
``
the
*NL*
fellow
is
his
pimp
;
for
I
never
saw
so
ill-looked
a
villain
.
Besides
,
*NL*
such
profligate
rakes
as
Mr
Jones
are
never
ashamed
of
these
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
this
behaviour
of
Partridge
was
a
little
*NL*
inexcusable
;
but
he
had
not
slept
off
the
effect
of
the
dose
which
he
*NL*
swallowed
the
evening
before
;
which
had
,
in
the
morning
,
received
the
*NL*
addition
of
above
a
pint
of
wine
,
or
indeed
rather
of
malt
spirits
;
*NL*
for
the
perry
was
by
no
means
pure
.
Now
,
that
part
of
his
head
which
*NL*
Nature
designed
for
the
reservoir
of
drink
being
very
shallow
,
a
small
*NL*
quantity
of
liquor
overflowed
it
,
and
opened
the
sluices
of
his
heart
;
*NL*
so
that
all
the
secrets
there
deposited
run
out
.
These
sluices
were
*NL*
indeed
,
naturally
,
very
ill-secured
.
To
give
the
best-natured
turn
we
*NL*
can
to
his
disposition
,
he
was
a
very
honest
man
;
for
,
as
he
was
the
*NL*
most
inquisitive
of
mortals
,
and
eternally
prying
into
the
secrets
of
*NL*
others
,
so
he
very
faithfully
paid
them
by
communicating
,
in
return
,
*NL*
everything
within
his
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Sophia
,
tormented
with
anxiety
,
knew
not
what
to
believe
,
nor
*NL*
what
resolution
to
take
,
Susan
arrived
with
the
sack-whey
.
Mrs
Honour
*NL*
immediately
advised
her
mistress
,
in
a
whisper
,
to
pump
this
wench
,
*NL*
who
probably
could
inform
her
of
the
truth
.
Sophia
approved
it
,
and
*NL*
began
as
follows
:
``
Come
hither
,
child
;
now
answer
me
truly
what
I
am
*NL*
going
to
ask
you
,
and
I
promise
you
I
will
very
well
reward
you
.
Is
*NL*
there
a
young
gentleman
in
this
house
,
a
handsome
young
gentleman
,
*NL*
that
--
.
''
Here
Sophia
blushed
and
was
confounded
.
``
A
young
*NL*
gentleman
,
''
cries
Honour
,
``
that
came
hither
in
company
with
that
saucy
*NL*
rascal
who
is
now
in
the
kitchen
?
''
Susan
answered
,
``
There
was
.
''
--
``
Do
*NL*
you
know
anything
of
any
lady
?
''
continues
Sophia
,
``
any
lady
?
I
do
n't
*NL*
ask
you
whether
she
is
handsome
or
no
;
perhaps
she
is
not
;
that
's
*NL*
nothing
to
the
purpose
;
but
do
you
know
of
any
lady
?
''
``
La
,
madam
,
''
*NL*
cries
Honour
,
``
you
will
make
a
very
bad
examiner
.
Hark
`
ee
,
child
,
''
*NL*
says
she
,
``
is
not
that
very
young
gentleman
now
in
bed
with
some
nasty
*NL*
trull
or
other
?
''
Here
Susan
smiled
,
and
was
silent
.
``
Answer
the
*NL*
question
,
child
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
and
here
's
a
guinea
for
you
.
''
--
``
A
*NL*
guinea
!
madam
,
''
cries
Susan
;
``
la
,
what
's
a
guinea
?
If
my
mistress
*NL*
should
know
it
I
shall
certainly
lose
my
place
that
very
instant
.
''
*NL*
``
Here
's
another
for
you
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
and
I
promise
you
faithfully
*NL*
your
mistress
shall
never
know
it
.
''
Susan
,
after
a
very
short
*NL*
hesitation
,
took
the
money
,
and
told
the
whole
story
,
concluding
with
*NL*
saying
,
``
If
you
have
any
great
curiosity
,
madam
,
I
can
steal
softly
*NL*
into
his
room
,
and
see
whether
he
be
in
his
own
bed
or
no
.
''
She
*NL*
accordingly
did
this
by
Sophia
's
desire
,
and
returned
with
an
answer
*NL*
in
the
negative
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
now
trembled
and
turned
pale
.
Mrs
Honour
begged
her
to
be
*NL*
comforted
,
and
not
to
think
any
more
of
so
worthless
a
fellow
.
``
Why
*NL*
there
,
''
says
Susan
,
``
I
hope
,
madam
,
your
ladyship
wo
n't
be
offended
;
*NL*
but
pray
,
madam
,
is
not
your
ladyship
's
name
Madam
Sophia
Western
?
''
*NL*
``
How
is
it
possible
you
should
know
me
?
''
answered
Sophia
.
``
Why
that
*NL*
man
,
that
the
gentlewoman
spoke
of
,
who
is
in
the
kitchen
,
told
about
*NL*
you
last
night
.
But
I
hope
your
ladyship
is
not
angry
with
me
.
''
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
child
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
am
not
;
pray
tell
me
all
,
and
I
promise
*NL*
you
I
'll
reward
you
.
''
``
Why
,
madam
,
''
continued
Susan
,
``
that
man
told
us
*NL*
all
in
the
kitchen
that
Madam
Sophia
Western
--
indeed
I
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
to
bring
it
out
.
''
--
Here
she
stopt
,
till
,
having
received
encouragement
*NL*
from
Sophia
,
and
being
vehemently
pressed
by
Mrs
Honour
,
she
proceeded
*NL*
thus
:
--
``
He
told
us
,
madam
,
though
to
be
sure
it
is
all
a
lie
,
that
*NL*
your
ladyship
was
dying
for
love
of
the
young
squire
,
and
that
he
was
*NL*
going
to
the
wars
to
get
rid
of
you
.
I
thought
to
myself
then
he
was
a
*NL*
false-hearted
wretch
;
but
,
now
,
to
see
such
a
fine
,
rich
,
beautiful
*NL*
lady
as
you
be
,
forsaken
for
such
an
ordinary
woman
;
for
to
be
sure
so
*NL*
she
is
,
and
another
man
's
wife
into
the
bargain
.
It
is
such
a
strange
*NL*
unnatural
thing
,
in
a
manner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
gave
her
a
third
guinea
,
and
,
telling
her
she
would
certainly
*NL*
be
her
friend
if
she
mentioned
nothing
of
what
had
passed
,
nor
*NL*
informed
any
one
who
she
was
,
dismissed
the
girl
,
with
orders
to
the
*NL*
post-boy
to
get
the
horses
ready
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
now
left
alone
with
her
maid
,
she
told
her
trusty
waiting-woman
,
*NL*
``
That
she
never
was
more
easy
than
at
present
.
I
am
now
convinced
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
``
he
is
not
only
a
villain
,
but
a
low
despicable
wretch
.
I
*NL*
can
forgive
all
rather
than
his
exposing
my
name
in
so
barbarous
a
*NL*
manner
.
That
renders
him
the
object
of
my
contempt
.
Yes
,
Honour
,
I
am
*NL*
now
easy
;
I
am
indeed
;
I
am
very
easy
;
''
and
then
she
burst
into
a
*NL*
violent
flood
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
interval
spent
by
Sophia
,
chiefly
in
crying
,
and
*NL*
assuring
her
maid
that
she
was
perfectly
easy
,
Susan
arrived
with
an
*NL*
account
that
the
horses
were
ready
,
when
a
very
extraordinary
thought
*NL*
suggested
itself
to
our
young
heroine
,
by
which
Mr
Jones
would
be
*NL*
acquainted
with
her
having
been
at
the
inn
,
in
a
way
which
,
if
any
*NL*
sparks
of
affection
for
her
remained
in
him
,
would
be
at
least
some
*NL*
punishment
for
his
faults
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
be
pleased
to
remember
a
little
muff
,
which
hath
had
*NL*
the
honour
of
being
more
than
once
remembered
already
in
this
history
.
*NL*
This
muff
,
ever
since
the
departure
of
Mr
Jones
,
had
been
the
constant
*NL*
companion
of
Sophia
by
day
,
and
her
bedfellow
by
night
;
and
this
muff
*NL*
she
had
at
this
very
instant
upon
her
arm
;
whence
she
took
it
off
with
*NL*
great
indignation
,
and
,
having
writ
her
name
with
her
pencil
upon
a
*NL*
piece
of
paper
which
she
pinned
to
it
,
she
bribed
the
maid
to
convey
*NL*
it
into
the
empty
bed
of
Mr
Jones
,
in
which
,
if
he
did
not
find
it
,
*NL*
she
charged
her
to
take
some
method
of
conveying
it
before
his
eyes
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
having
paid
for
what
Mrs
Honour
had
eaten
,
in
which
bill
was
*NL*
included
an
account
for
what
she
herself
might
have
eaten
,
she
mounted
*NL*
her
horse
,
and
,
once
more
assuring
her
companion
that
she
was
*NL*
perfectly
easy
,
continued
her
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
,
among
other
things
,
the
ingenuity
of
Partridge
,
the
*NL*
madness
of
Jones
,
and
the
folly
of
Fitzpatrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
past
five
in
the
morning
,
and
other
company
began
to
rise
*NL*
and
come
to
the
kitchen
,
among
whom
were
the
serjeant
and
the
*NL*
coachman
,
who
,
being
thoroughly
reconciled
,
made
a
libation
,
or
,
in
*NL*
the
English
phrase
,
drank
a
hearty
cup
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
drinking
nothing
more
remarkable
happened
than
the
behaviour
*NL*
of
Partridge
,
who
,
when
the
serjeant
drank
a
health
to
King
George
,
*NL*
repeated
only
the
word
King
;
nor
could
he
be
brought
to
utter
more
;
*NL*
for
though
he
was
going
to
fight
against
his
own
cause
,
yet
he
could
*NL*
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
drink
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
,
being
now
returned
to
his
own
bed
-LRB-
but
from
whence
he
*NL*
returned
we
must
beg
to
be
excused
from
relating
-RRB-
,
summoned
Partridge
*NL*
from
this
agreeable
company
,
who
,
after
a
ceremonious
preface
,
having
*NL*
obtained
leave
to
offer
his
advice
,
delivered
himself
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
sir
,
an
old
saying
,
and
a
true
one
,
that
a
wise
man
may
*NL*
sometimes
learn
counsel
from
a
fool
;
I
wish
,
therefore
,
I
might
be
so
*NL*
bold
as
to
offer
you
my
advice
,
which
is
to
return
home
again
,
and
*NL*
leave
these
_
horrida
bella
_
,
these
bloody
wars
,
to
fellows
who
are
*NL*
contented
to
swallow
gunpowder
,
because
they
have
nothing
else
to
eat
.
*NL*
Now
,
everybody
knows
your
honour
wants
for
nothing
at
home
;
when
*NL*
that
's
the
case
,
why
should
any
man
travel
abroad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Partridge
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
thou
art
certainly
a
coward
;
I
wish
,
*NL*
therefore
,
thou
wouldst
return
home
thyself
,
and
trouble
me
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
your
honour
's
pardon
,
''
cries
Partridge
;
``
I
spoke
on
your
*NL*
account
more
than
my
own
;
for
as
to
me
,
Heaven
knows
my
circumstances
*NL*
are
bad
enough
,
and
I
am
so
far
from
being
afraid
,
that
I
value
a
*NL*
pistol
,
or
a
blunderbuss
,
or
any
such
thing
,
no
more
than
a
pop-gun
.
*NL*
Every
man
must
die
once
,
and
what
signifies
the
manner
how
?
besides
,
*NL*
perhaps
I
may
come
off
with
the
loss
only
of
an
arm
or
a
leg
.
I
assure
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
I
was
never
less
afraid
in
my
life
;
and
so
,
if
your
honour
*NL*
is
resolved
to
go
on
,
I
am
resolved
to
follow
you
.
But
,
in
that
case
,
*NL*
I
wish
I
might
give
my
opinion
.
To
be
sure
,
it
is
a
scandalous
way
of
*NL*
travelling
,
for
a
great
gentleman
like
you
to
walk
afoot
.
Now
here
are
*NL*
two
or
three
good
horses
in
the
stable
,
which
the
landlord
will
*NL*
certainly
make
no
scruple
of
trusting
you
with
;
but
,
if
he
should
,
I
*NL*
can
easily
contrive
to
take
them
;
and
,
let
the
worst
come
to
the
*NL*
worst
,
the
king
would
certainly
pardon
you
,
as
you
are
going
to
fight
*NL*
in
his
cause
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
the
honesty
of
Partridge
was
equal
to
his
understanding
,
and
*NL*
both
dealt
only
in
small
matters
,
he
would
never
have
attempted
a
*NL*
roguery
of
this
kind
,
had
he
not
imagined
it
altogether
safe
;
for
he
*NL*
was
one
of
those
who
have
more
consideration
of
the
gallows
than
of
*NL*
the
fitness
of
things
;
but
,
in
reality
,
he
thought
he
might
have
*NL*
committed
this
felony
without
any
danger
;
for
,
besides
that
he
doubted
*NL*
not
but
the
name
of
Mr
Allworthy
would
sufficiently
quiet
the
*NL*
landlord
,
he
conceived
they
should
be
altogether
safe
,
whatever
turn
*NL*
affairs
might
take
;
as
Jones
,
he
imagined
,
would
have
friends
enough
*NL*
on
one
side
,
and
as
his
friends
would
as
well
secure
him
on
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr
Jones
found
that
Partridge
was
in
earnest
in
this
proposal
,
he
*NL*
very
severely
rebuked
him
,
and
that
in
such
bitter
terms
,
that
the
*NL*
other
attempted
to
laugh
it
off
,
and
presently
turned
the
discourse
to
*NL*
other
matters
;
saying
,
he
believed
they
were
then
in
a
bawdy
house
,
*NL*
and
that
he
had
with
much
ado
prevented
two
wenches
from
disturbing
*NL*
his
honour
in
the
middle
of
the
night
.
``
Heyday
!
''
says
he
,
``
I
believe
*NL*
they
got
into
your
chamber
whether
I
would
or
no
;
for
here
lies
the
*NL*
muff
of
one
of
them
on
the
ground
.
''
Indeed
,
as
Jones
returned
to
his
*NL*
bed
in
the
dark
,
he
had
never
perceived
the
muff
on
the
quilt
,
and
,
in
*NL*
leaping
into
his
bed
,
he
had
tumbled
it
on
the
floor
.
This
Partridge
*NL*
now
took
up
,
and
was
going
to
put
into
his
pocket
,
when
Jones
desired
*NL*
to
see
it
.
The
muff
was
so
very
remarkable
,
that
our
heroe
might
*NL*
possibly
have
recollected
it
without
the
information
annexed
.
But
his
*NL*
memory
was
not
put
to
that
hard
office
;
for
at
the
same
instant
he
saw
*NL*
and
read
the
words
Sophia
Western
upon
the
paper
which
was
pinned
to
*NL*
it
.
His
looks
now
grew
frantic
in
a
moment
,
and
he
eagerly
cried
out
,
*NL*
``
Oh
Heavens
!
how
came
this
muff
here
?
''
``
I
know
no
more
than
your
*NL*
honour
,
''
cried
Partridge
;
``
but
I
saw
it
upon
the
arm
of
one
of
the
*NL*
women
who
would
have
disturbed
you
,
if
I
would
have
suffered
them
.
''
*NL*
``
Where
are
they
?
''
cries
Jones
,
jumping
out
of
bed
,
and
laying
hold
of
*NL*
his
cloaths
.
``
Many
miles
off
,
I
believe
,
by
this
time
,
''
said
*NL*
Partridge
.
And
now
Jones
,
upon
further
enquiry
,
was
sufficiently
*NL*
assured
that
the
bearer
of
this
muff
was
no
other
than
the
lovely
*NL*
Sophia
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
behaviour
of
Jones
on
this
occasion
,
his
thoughts
,
his
looks
,
his
*NL*
words
,
his
actions
,
were
such
as
beggar
all
description
.
After
many
*NL*
bitter
execrations
on
Partridge
,
and
not
fewer
on
himself
,
he
ordered
*NL*
the
poor
fellow
,
who
was
frightened
out
of
his
wits
,
to
run
down
and
*NL*
hire
him
horses
at
any
rate
;
and
a
very
few
minutes
afterwards
,
having
*NL*
shuffled
on
his
clothes
,
he
hastened
down-stairs
to
execute
the
orders
*NL*
himself
,
which
he
had
just
before
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
we
proceed
to
what
passed
on
his
arrival
in
the
kitchen
,
it
*NL*
will
be
necessary
to
recur
to
what
had
there
happened
since
Partridge
*NL*
had
first
left
it
on
his
master
's
summons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
serjeant
was
just
marched
off
with
his
party
,
when
the
two
Irish
*NL*
gentlemen
arose
,
and
came
downstairs
;
both
complaining
that
they
had
*NL*
been
so
often
waked
by
the
noises
in
the
inn
,
that
they
had
never
once
*NL*
been
able
to
close
their
eyes
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coach
which
had
brought
the
young
lady
and
her
maid
,
and
which
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
the
reader
may
have
hitherto
concluded
was
her
own
,
was
,
*NL*
indeed
,
a
returned
coach
belonging
to
Mr
King
,
of
Bath
,
one
of
the
*NL*
worthiest
and
honestest
men
that
ever
dealt
in
horse-flesh
,
and
whose
*NL*
coaches
we
heartily
recommend
to
all
our
readers
who
travel
that
road
.
*NL*
By
which
means
they
may
,
perhaps
,
have
the
pleasure
of
riding
in
the
*NL*
very
coach
,
and
being
driven
by
the
very
coachman
,
that
is
recorded
in
*NL*
this
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
,
having
but
two
passengers
,
and
hearing
Mr
Maclachlan
was
*NL*
going
to
Bath
,
offered
to
carry
him
thither
at
a
very
moderate
price
.
*NL*
He
was
induced
to
this
by
the
report
of
the
hostler
,
who
said
that
the
*NL*
horse
which
Mr
Maclachlan
had
hired
from
Worcester
would
be
much
more
*NL*
pleased
with
returning
to
his
friends
there
than
to
prosecute
a
long
*NL*
journey
;
for
that
the
said
horse
was
rather
a
two-legged
than
a
*NL*
four-legged
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Maclachlan
immediately
closed
with
the
proposal
of
the
coachman
,
*NL*
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
persuaded
his
friend
Fitzpatrick
to
accept
of
*NL*
the
fourth
place
in
the
coach
.
This
conveyance
the
soreness
of
his
*NL*
bones
made
more
agreeable
to
him
than
a
horse
;
and
,
being
well
assured
*NL*
of
meeting
with
his
wife
at
Bath
,
he
thought
a
little
delay
would
be
*NL*
of
no
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maclachlan
,
who
was
much
the
sharper
man
of
the
two
,
no
sooner
heard
*NL*
that
this
lady
came
from
Chester
,
with
the
other
circumstances
which
*NL*
he
learned
from
the
hostler
,
than
it
came
into
his
head
that
she
might
*NL*
possibly
be
his
friend
's
wife
;
and
presently
acquainted
him
with
this
*NL*
suspicion
,
which
had
never
once
occurred
to
Fitzpatrick
himself
.
To
*NL*
say
the
truth
,
he
was
one
of
those
compositions
which
nature
makes
up
*NL*
in
too
great
a
hurry
,
and
forgets
to
put
any
brains
into
their
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
happens
to
this
sort
of
men
,
as
to
bad
hounds
,
who
never
hit
*NL*
off
a
fault
themselves
;
but
no
sooner
doth
a
dog
of
sagacity
open
his
*NL*
mouth
than
they
immediately
do
the
same
,
and
,
without
the
guidance
of
*NL*
any
scent
,
run
directly
forwards
as
fast
as
they
are
able
.
In
the
same
*NL*
manner
,
the
very
moment
Mr
Maclachlan
had
mentioned
his
apprehension
,
*NL*
Mr
Fitzpatrick
instantly
concurred
,
and
flew
directly
up-stairs
,
to
*NL*
surprize
his
wife
,
before
he
knew
where
she
was
;
and
unluckily
-LRB-
as
*NL*
Fortune
loves
to
play
tricks
with
those
gentlemen
who
put
themselves
*NL*
entirely
under
her
conduct
-RRB-
ran
his
head
against
several
doors
and
*NL*
posts
to
no
purpose
.
Much
kinder
was
she
to
me
,
when
she
suggested
*NL*
that
simile
of
the
hounds
,
just
before
inserted
;
since
the
poor
wife
*NL*
may
,
on
these
occasions
,
be
so
justly
compared
to
a
hunted
hare
.
Like
*NL*
that
little
wretched
animal
,
she
pricks
up
her
ears
to
listen
after
*NL*
the
voice
of
her
pursuer
;
like
her
,
flies
away
trembling
when
she
*NL*
hears
it
;
and
,
like
her
,
is
generally
overtaken
and
destroyed
in
the
*NL*
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
however
the
case
at
present
;
for
after
a
long
fruitless
*NL*
search
,
Mr
Fitzpatrick
returned
to
the
kitchen
,
where
,
as
if
this
had
*NL*
been
a
real
chace
,
entered
a
gentleman
hallowing
as
hunters
do
when
*NL*
the
hounds
are
at
a
fault
.
He
was
just
alighted
from
his
horse
,
and
*NL*
had
many
attendants
at
his
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
reader
,
it
may
be
necessary
to
acquaint
thee
with
some
matters
,
*NL*
which
,
if
thou
dost
know
already
,
thou
art
wiser
than
I
take
thee
to
*NL*
be
.
And
this
information
thou
shalt
receive
in
the
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
are
concluded
the
adventures
that
happened
at
the
inn
at
*NL*
Upton
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
then
,
this
gentleman
just
arrived
was
no
other
*NL*
person
than
Squire
Western
himself
,
who
was
come
hither
in
pursuit
of
*NL*
his
daughter
;
and
,
had
he
fortunately
been
two
hours
earlier
,
he
had
*NL*
not
only
found
her
,
but
his
niece
into
the
bargain
;
for
such
was
the
*NL*
wife
of
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
who
had
run
away
with
her
five
years
before
,
*NL*
out
of
the
custody
of
that
sage
lady
,
Madam
Western
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
lady
had
departed
from
the
inn
much
about
the
same
time
with
*NL*
Sophia
;
for
,
having
been
waked
by
the
voice
of
her
husband
,
she
had
*NL*
sent
up
for
the
landlady
,
and
being
by
her
apprized
of
the
matter
,
had
*NL*
bribed
the
good
woman
,
at
an
extravagant
price
,
to
furnish
her
with
*NL*
horses
for
her
escape
.
Such
prevalence
had
money
in
this
family
;
and
*NL*
though
the
mistress
would
have
turned
away
her
maid
for
a
corrupt
*NL*
hussy
,
if
she
had
known
as
much
as
the
reader
,
yet
she
was
no
more
*NL*
proof
against
corruption
herself
than
poor
Susan
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
and
his
nephew
were
not
known
to
one
another
;
nor
indeed
*NL*
would
the
former
have
taken
any
notice
of
the
latter
if
he
had
known
*NL*
him
;
for
,
this
being
a
stolen
match
,
and
consequently
an
unnatural
one
*NL*
in
the
opinion
of
the
good
squire
,
he
had
,
from
the
time
of
her
*NL*
committing
it
,
abandoned
the
poor
young
creature
,
who
was
then
no
more
*NL*
than
eighteen
,
as
a
monster
,
and
had
never
since
suffered
her
to
be
*NL*
named
in
his
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kitchen
was
now
a
scene
of
universal
confusion
,
Western
enquiring
*NL*
after
his
daughter
,
and
Fitzpatrick
as
eagerly
after
his
wife
,
when
*NL*
Jones
entered
the
room
,
unfortunately
having
Sophia
's
muff
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Western
saw
Jones
,
he
set
up
the
same
holla
as
is
used
by
*NL*
sportsmen
when
their
game
is
in
view
.
He
then
immediately
run
up
and
*NL*
laid
hold
of
Jones
,
crying
,
``
We
have
got
the
dog
fox
,
I
warrant
the
*NL*
bitch
is
not
far
off
.
''
The
jargon
which
followed
for
some
minutes
,
*NL*
where
many
spoke
different
things
at
the
same
time
,
as
it
would
be
*NL*
very
difficult
to
describe
,
so
would
it
be
no
less
unpleasant
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
having
,
at
length
,
shaken
Mr
Western
off
,
and
some
of
the
*NL*
company
having
interfered
between
them
,
our
heroe
protested
his
*NL*
innocence
as
to
knowing
anything
of
the
lady
;
when
Parson
Supple
*NL*
stepped
up
,
and
said
,
``
It
is
folly
to
deny
it
;
for
why
,
the
marks
of
*NL*
guilt
are
in
thy
hands
.
I
will
myself
asseverate
and
bind
it
by
an
*NL*
oath
,
that
the
muff
thou
bearest
in
thy
hand
belongeth
unto
Madam
*NL*
Sophia
;
for
I
have
frequently
observed
her
,
of
later
days
,
to
bear
it
*NL*
about
her
.
''
``
My
daughter
's
muff
!
''
cries
the
squire
in
a
rage
.
``
Hath
he
*NL*
got
my
daughter
's
muff
?
bear
witness
the
goods
are
found
upon
him
.
*NL*
I
'll
have
him
before
a
justice
of
peace
this
instant
.
Where
is
my
*NL*
daughter
,
villain
?
''
``
Sir
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
I
beg
you
would
be
pacified
.
*NL*
The
muff
,
I
acknowledge
,
is
the
young
lady
's
;
but
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
*NL*
have
never
seen
her
.
''
At
these
words
Western
lost
all
patience
,
and
*NL*
grew
inarticulate
with
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
servants
had
acquainted
Fitzpatrick
who
Mr
Western
was
.
*NL*
The
good
Irishman
,
therefore
,
thinking
he
had
now
an
opportunity
to
do
*NL*
an
act
of
service
to
his
uncle
,
and
by
that
means
might
possibly
*NL*
obtain
his
favour
,
stept
up
to
Jones
,
and
cried
out
,
``
Upon
my
*NL*
conscience
,
sir
,
you
may
be
ashamed
of
denying
your
having
seen
the
*NL*
gentleman
's
daughter
before
my
face
,
when
you
know
I
found
you
there
*NL*
upon
the
bed
together
.
''
Then
,
turning
to
Western
,
he
offered
to
*NL*
conduct
him
immediately
to
the
room
where
his
daughter
was
;
which
*NL*
offer
being
accepted
,
he
,
the
squire
,
the
parson
,
and
some
others
,
*NL*
ascended
directly
to
Mrs
Waters
's
chamber
,
which
they
entered
with
no
*NL*
less
violence
than
Mr
Fitzpatrick
had
done
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
lady
started
from
her
sleep
with
as
much
amazement
as
terror
,
*NL*
and
beheld
at
her
bedside
a
figure
which
might
very
well
be
supposed
*NL*
to
have
escaped
out
of
Bedlam
.
Such
wildness
and
confusion
were
in
the
*NL*
looks
of
Mr
Western
;
who
no
sooner
saw
the
lady
than
he
started
back
,
*NL*
shewing
sufficiently
by
his
manner
,
before
he
spoke
,
that
this
was
not
*NL*
the
person
sought
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
more
tenderly
do
women
value
their
reputation
than
their
*NL*
persons
,
that
,
though
the
latter
seemed
now
in
more
danger
than
*NL*
before
,
yet
,
as
the
former
was
secure
,
the
lady
screamed
not
with
such
*NL*
violence
as
she
had
done
on
the
other
occasion
.
However
,
she
no
sooner
*NL*
found
herself
alone
than
she
abandoned
all
thoughts
of
further
repose
;
*NL*
and
,
as
she
had
sufficient
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
her
present
*NL*
lodging
,
she
dressed
herself
with
all
possible
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
now
proceeded
to
search
the
whole
house
,
but
to
as
little
*NL*
purpose
as
he
had
disturbed
poor
Mrs
Waters
.
He
then
returned
*NL*
disconsolate
into
the
kitchen
,
where
he
found
Jones
in
the
custody
of
*NL*
his
servants
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
violent
uproar
had
raised
all
the
people
in
the
house
,
though
it
*NL*
was
yet
scarcely
daylight
.
Among
these
was
a
grave
gentleman
,
who
had
*NL*
the
honour
to
be
in
the
commission
of
the
peace
for
the
county
of
*NL*
Worcester
.
Of
which
Mr
Western
was
no
sooner
informed
than
he
offered
*NL*
to
lay
his
complaint
before
him
.
The
justice
declined
executing
his
*NL*
office
,
as
he
said
he
had
no
clerk
present
,
nor
no
book
about
justice
*NL*
business
;
and
that
he
could
not
carry
all
the
law
in
his
head
about
*NL*
stealing
away
daughters
,
and
such
sort
of
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr
Fitzpatrick
offered
to
lend
him
his
assistance
,
informing
the
*NL*
company
that
he
had
been
himself
bred
to
the
law
.
-LRB-
And
indeed
he
had
*NL*
served
three
years
as
clerk
to
an
attorney
in
the
north
of
Ireland
,
*NL*
when
,
chusing
a
genteeler
walk
in
life
,
he
quitted
his
master
,
came
*NL*
over
to
England
,
and
set
up
that
business
which
requires
no
*NL*
apprenticeship
,
namely
,
that
of
a
gentleman
,
in
which
he
had
*NL*
succeeded
,
as
hath
been
already
partly
mentioned
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Fitzpatrick
declared
that
the
law
concerning
daughters
was
out
of
*NL*
the
present
case
;
that
stealing
a
muff
was
undoubtedly
felony
,
and
the
*NL*
goods
being
found
upon
the
person
,
were
sufficient
evidence
of
the
*NL*
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
magistrate
,
upon
the
encouragement
of
so
learned
a
coadjutor
,
and
*NL*
upon
the
violent
intercession
of
the
squire
,
was
at
length
prevailed
*NL*
upon
to
seat
himself
in
the
chair
of
justice
,
where
being
placed
,
upon
*NL*
viewing
the
muff
which
Jones
still
held
in
his
hand
,
and
upon
the
*NL*
parson
's
swearing
it
to
be
the
property
of
Mr
Western
,
he
desired
Mr
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
to
draw
up
a
commitment
,
which
he
said
he
would
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
now
desired
to
be
heard
,
which
was
at
last
,
with
difficulty
,
*NL*
granted
him
.
He
then
produced
the
evidence
of
Mr
Partridge
,
as
to
the
*NL*
finding
it
;
but
,
what
was
still
more
,
Susan
deposed
that
Sophia
*NL*
herself
had
delivered
the
muff
to
her
,
and
had
ordered
her
to
convey
*NL*
it
into
the
chamber
where
Mr
Jones
had
found
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
a
natural
love
of
justice
,
or
the
extraordinary
comeliness
of
*NL*
Jones
,
had
wrought
on
Susan
to
make
the
discovery
,
I
will
not
*NL*
determine
;
but
such
were
the
effects
of
her
evidence
,
that
the
*NL*
magistrate
,
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
declared
that
the
*NL*
matter
was
now
altogether
as
clear
on
the
side
of
the
prisoner
as
it
*NL*
had
before
been
against
him
:
with
which
the
parson
concurred
,
saying
,
*NL*
the
Lord
forbid
he
should
be
instrumental
in
committing
an
innocent
*NL*
person
to
durance
.
The
justice
then
arose
,
acquitted
the
prisoner
,
and
*NL*
broke
up
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
now
gave
every
one
present
a
hearty
curse
,
and
,
immediately
*NL*
ordering
his
horses
,
departed
in
pursuit
of
his
daughter
,
without
*NL*
taking
the
least
notice
of
his
nephew
Fitzpatrick
,
or
returning
any
*NL*
answer
to
his
claim
of
kindred
,
notwithstanding
all
the
obligations
he
*NL*
had
just
received
from
that
gentleman
.
In
the
violence
,
moreover
,
of
*NL*
his
hurry
,
and
of
his
passion
,
he
luckily
forgot
to
demand
the
muff
of
*NL*
Jones
:
I
say
luckily
;
for
he
would
have
died
on
the
spot
rather
than
*NL*
have
parted
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
likewise
,
with
his
friend
Partridge
,
set
forward
the
moment
he
*NL*
had
paid
his
reckoning
,
in
quest
of
his
lovely
Sophia
,
whom
he
now
*NL*
resolved
never
more
to
abandon
the
pursuit
of
.
Nor
could
he
bring
*NL*
himself
even
to
take
leave
of
Mrs
Waters
;
of
whom
he
detested
the
very
*NL*
thoughts
,
as
she
had
been
,
though
not
designedly
,
the
occasion
of
his
*NL*
missing
the
happiest
interview
with
Sophia
,
to
whom
he
now
vowed
*NL*
eternal
constancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Mrs
Waters
,
she
took
the
opportunity
of
the
coach
which
was
*NL*
going
to
Bath
;
for
which
place
she
set
out
in
company
with
the
two
*NL*
Irish
gentlemen
,
the
landlady
kindly
lending
her
her
cloaths
;
in
*NL*
return
for
which
she
was
contented
only
to
receive
about
double
their
*NL*
value
,
as
a
recompence
for
the
loan
.
Upon
the
road
she
was
perfectly
*NL*
reconciled
to
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
who
was
a
very
handsome
fellow
,
and
*NL*
indeed
did
all
she
could
to
console
him
in
the
absence
of
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
the
many
odd
adventures
which
Mr
Jones
encountered
at
his
*NL*
inn
at
Upton
,
where
they
talk
,
to
this
day
,
of
the
beauty
and
lovely
*NL*
behaviour
of
the
charming
Sophia
,
by
the
name
of
the
Somersetshire
*NL*
angel
.

Chapter
viii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
the
history
goes
backward
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
proceed
any
farther
in
our
history
,
it
may
be
proper
to
look
*NL*
a
little
back
,
in
order
to
account
for
the
extraordinary
appearance
of
*NL*
Sophia
and
her
father
at
the
inn
at
Upton
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
be
pleased
to
remember
that
,
in
the
ninth
chapter
of
*NL*
the
seventh
book
of
our
history
,
we
left
Sophia
,
after
a
long
debate
*NL*
between
love
and
duty
,
deciding
the
cause
,
as
it
usually
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
happens
,
in
favour
of
the
former
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
debate
had
arisen
,
as
we
have
there
shown
,
from
a
visit
which
her
*NL*
father
had
just
before
made
her
,
in
order
to
force
her
consent
to
a
*NL*
marriage
with
Blifil
;
and
which
he
had
understood
to
be
fully
implied
*NL*
in
her
acknowledgment
``
that
she
neither
must
nor
could
refuse
any
*NL*
absolute
command
of
his
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
from
this
visit
the
squire
retired
to
his
evening
potation
,
*NL*
overjoyed
at
the
success
he
had
gained
with
his
daughter
;
and
,
as
he
*NL*
was
of
a
social
disposition
,
and
willing
to
have
partakers
in
his
*NL*
happiness
,
the
beer
was
ordered
to
flow
very
liberally
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
;
so
that
before
eleven
in
the
evening
there
was
not
a
single
*NL*
person
sober
in
the
house
except
only
Mrs
Western
herself
and
the
*NL*
charming
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
a
messenger
was
despatched
to
summon
Mr
Blifil
;
*NL*
for
,
though
the
squire
imagined
that
young
gentleman
had
been
much
*NL*
less
acquainted
than
he
really
was
with
the
former
aversion
of
his
*NL*
daughter
,
as
he
had
not
,
however
,
yet
received
her
consent
,
he
longed
*NL*
impatiently
to
communicate
it
to
him
,
not
doubting
but
that
the
*NL*
intended
bride
herself
would
confirm
it
with
her
lips
.
As
to
the
*NL*
wedding
,
it
had
the
evening
before
been
fixed
,
by
the
male
parties
,
to
*NL*
be
celebrated
on
the
next
morning
save
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Breakfast
was
now
set
forth
in
the
parlour
,
where
Mr
Blifil
attended
,
*NL*
and
where
the
squire
and
his
sister
likewise
were
assembled
;
and
now
*NL*
Sophia
was
ordered
to
be
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
,
Shakespear
!
had
I
thy
pen
!
O
,
Hogarth
!
had
I
thy
pencil
!
then
would
*NL*
I
draw
the
picture
of
the
poor
serving-man
,
who
,
with
pale
*NL*
countenance
,
staring
eyes
,
chattering
teeth
,
faultering
tongue
,
and
*NL*
trembling
limbs
,
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
E'en
such
a
man
,
so
faint
,
so
spiritless
,
*NL*
So
dull
,
so
dead
in
look
,
so
woe-begone
,
*NL*
Drew
Priam
's
curtains
in
the
dead
of
night
,
*NL*
And
would
have
told
him
,
half
his
Troy

burn
'd
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
entered
the
room
,
and
declared
--
That
Madam
Sophia
was
not
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to
be
found
!
''
cries
the
squire
,
starting
from
his
chair
;
``
Zounds
*NL*
and
d
--
nation
!
Blood
and
fury
!
Where
,
when
,
how
,
what
--
Not
to
be
*NL*
found
!
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
!
brother
,
''
said
Mrs
Western
,
with
true
political
coldness
,
``
you
*NL*
are
always
throwing
yourself
into
such
violent
passions
for
nothing
.
*NL*
My
niece
,
I
suppose
,
is
only
walked
out
into
the
garden
.
I
protest
you
*NL*
are
grown
so
unreasonable
,
that
it
is
impossible
to
live
in
the
house
*NL*
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
nay
,
''
answered
the
squire
,
returning
as
suddenly
to
himself
,
as
*NL*
he
had
gone
from
himself
;
``
if
that
be
all
the
matter
,
it
signifies
not
*NL*
much
;
but
,
upon
my
soul
,
my
mind
misgave
me
when
the
fellow
said
she
*NL*
was
not
to
be
found
.
''
He
then
gave
orders
for
the
bell
to
be
rung
in
*NL*
the
garden
,
and
sat
himself
contentedly
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
two
things
could
be
more
the
reverse
of
each
other
than
were
the
*NL*
brother
and
sister
in
most
instances
;
particularly
in
this
,
That
as
*NL*
the
brother
never
foresaw
anything
at
a
distance
,
but
was
most
*NL*
sagacious
in
immediately
seeing
everything
the
moment
it
had
happened
;
*NL*
so
the
sister
eternally
foresaw
at
a
distance
,
but
was
not
so
*NL*
quick-sighted
to
objects
before
her
eyes
.
Of
both
these
the
reader
may
*NL*
have
observed
examples
:
and
,
indeed
,
both
their
several
talents
were
*NL*
excessive
;
for
,
as
the
sister
often
foresaw
what
never
came
to
pass
,
*NL*
so
the
brother
often
saw
much
more
than
was
actually
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
however
the
case
at
present
.
The
same
report
was
brought
*NL*
from
the
garden
as
before
had
been
brought
from
the
chamber
,
that
*NL*
Madam
Sophia
was
not
to
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
himself
now
sallied
forth
,
and
began
to
roar
forth
the
name
*NL*
of
Sophia
as
loudly
,
and
in
as
hoarse
a
voice
,
as
whilome
did
Hercules
*NL*
that
of
Hylas
;
and
,
as
the
poet
tells
us
that
the
whole
shore
echoed
*NL*
back
the
name
of
that
beautiful
youth
,
so
did
the
house
,
the
garden
,
*NL*
and
all
the
neighbouring
fields
resound
nothing
but
the
name
of
*NL*
Sophia
,
in
the
hoarse
voices
of
the
men
,
and
in
the
shrill
pipes
of
*NL*
the
women
;
while
echo
seemed
so
pleased
to
repeat
the
beloved
sound
,
*NL*
that
,
if
there
is
really
such
a
person
,
I
believe
Ovid
hath
belied
her
*NL*
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
reigned
for
a
long
time
but
confusion
;
till
at
last
the
*NL*
squire
,
having
sufficiently
spent
his
breath
,
returned
to
the
parlour
,
*NL*
where
he
found
Mrs
Western
and
Mr
Blifil
,
and
threw
himself
,
with
the
*NL*
utmost
dejection
in
his
countenance
,
into
a
great
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mrs
Western
began
to
apply
the
following
consolation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
I
am
sorry
for
what
hath
happened
;
and
that
my
niece
should
*NL*
have
behaved
herself
in
a
manner
so
unbecoming
her
family
;
but
it
is
*NL*
all
your
own
doings
,
and
you
have
nobody
to
thank
but
yourself
.
You
*NL*
know
she
hath
been
educated
always
in
a
manner
directly
contrary
to
my
*NL*
advice
,
and
now
you
see
the
consequence
.
Have
I
not
a
thousand
times
*NL*
argued
with
you
about
giving
my
niece
her
own
will
?
But
you
know
I
*NL*
never
could
prevail
upon
you
;
and
when
I
had
taken
so
much
pains
to
*NL*
eradicate
her
headstrong
opinions
,
and
to
rectify
your
errors
in
*NL*
policy
,
you
know
she
was
taken
out
of
my
hands
;
so
that
I
have
nothing
*NL*
to
answer
for
.
Had
I
been
trusted
entirely
with
the
care
of
her
*NL*
education
,
no
such
accident
as
this
had
ever
befallen
you
;
so
that
you
*NL*
must
comfort
yourself
by
thinking
it
was
all
your
own
doing
;
and
,
*NL*
indeed
,
what
else
could
be
expected
from
such
indulgence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Zounds
!
sister
,
''
answered
he
,
``
you
are
enough
to
make
one
mad
.
Have
I
*NL*
indulged
her
?
Have
I
given
her
her
will
?
--
It
was
no
longer
ago
than
*NL*
last
night
that
I
threatened
,
if
she
disobeyed
me
,
to
confine
her
to
*NL*
her
chamber
upon
bread
and
water
as
long
as
she
lived
.
--
You
would
*NL*
provoke
the
patience
of
Job
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
ever
mortal
hear
the
like
?
''
replied
she
.
``
Brother
,
if
I
had
not
*NL*
the
patience
of
fifty
Jobs
,
you
would
make
me
forget
all
decency
and
*NL*
decorum
.
Why
would
you
interfere
?
Did
I
not
beg
you
,
did
I
not
intreat
*NL*
you
,
to
leave
the
whole
conduct
to
me
?
You
have
defeated
all
the
*NL*
operations
of
the
campaign
by
one
false
step
.
Would
any
man
in
his
*NL*
senses
have
provoked
a
daughter
by
such
threats
as
these
?
How
often
*NL*
have
I
told
you
that
English
women
are
not
to
be
treated
like
*NL*
Ciracessian
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
slaves
.
We
have
the
protection
of
the
world
;
we
are
to
*NL*
be
won
by
gentle
means
only
,
and
not
to
be
hectored
,
and
bullied
,
and
*NL*
beat
into
compliance
.
I
thank
Heaven
no
Salique
law
governs
here
.
*NL*
Brother
,
you
have
a
roughness
in
your
manner
which
no
woman
but
myself
*NL*
would
bear
.
I
do
not
wonder
my
niece
was
frightened
and
terrified
into
*NL*
taking
this
measure
;
and
,
to
speak
honestly
,
I
think
my
niece
will
be
*NL*
justified
to
the
world
for
what
she
hath
done
.
I
repeat
it
to
you
*NL*
again
,
brother
,
you
must
comfort
yourself
by
rememb
`
ring
that
it
is
*NL*
all
your
own
fault
.
How
often
have
I
advised
--
''
Here
Western
rose
*NL*
hastily
from
his
chair
,
and
,
venting
two
or
three
horrid
imprecations
,
*NL*
ran
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
Possibly
Circassian
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
departed
,
his
sister
expressed
more
bitterness
-LRB-
if
*NL*
possible
-RRB-
against
him
than
she
had
done
while
he
was
present
;
for
the
*NL*
truth
of
which
she
appealed
to
Mr
Blifil
,
who
,
with
great
complacence
,
*NL*
acquiesced
entirely
in
all
she
said
;
but
excused
all
the
faults
of
Mr
*NL*
Western
,
``
as
they
must
be
considered
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
have
proceeded
*NL*
from
the
too
inordinate
fondness
of
a
father
,
which
must
be
allowed
*NL*
the
name
of
an
amiable
weakness
.
''
``
So
much
the
more
inexcuseable
,
''
*NL*
answered
the
lady
;
``
for
whom
doth
he
ruin
by
his
fondness
but
his
own
*NL*
child
?
''
To
which
Blifil
immediately
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
then
began
to
express
great
confusion
on
the
account
of
Mr
*NL*
Blifil
,
and
of
the
usage
which
he
had
received
from
a
family
to
which
*NL*
he
intended
so
much
honour
.
On
this
subject
she
treated
the
folly
of
*NL*
her
niece
with
great
severity
;
but
concluded
with
throwing
the
whole
*NL*
on
her
brother
,
who
,
she
said
,
was
inexcuseable
to
have
proceeded
so
*NL*
far
without
better
assurances
of
his
daughter
's
consent
:
``
But
he
was
*NL*
-LRB-
says
she
-RRB-
always
of
a
violent
,
headstrong
temper
;
and
I
can
scarce
*NL*
forgive
myself
for
all
the
advice
I
have
thrown
away
upon
him
.

After
much
of
this
kind
of
conversation
,
which
,
perhaps
,
would
not
*NL*
greatly
entertain
the
reader
,
was
it
here
particularly
related
,
Mr
*NL*
Blifil
took
his
leave
and
returned
home
,
not
highly
pleased
with
his
*NL*
disappointment
:
which
,
however
,
the
philosophy
which
he
had
acquired
*NL*
from
Square
,
and
the
religion
infused
into
him
by
Thwackum
,
together
*NL*
with
somewhat
else
,
taught
him
to
bear
rather
better
than
more
*NL*
passionate
lovers
bear
these
kinds
of
evils
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
escape
of
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
now
time
to
look
after
Sophia
;
whom
the
reader
,
if
he
loves
her
*NL*
half
so
well
as
I
do
,
will
rejoice
to
find
escaped
from
the
clutches
*NL*
of
her
passionate
father
,
and
from
those
of
her
dispassionate
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twelve
times
did
the
iron
register
of
time
beat
on
the
sonorous
*NL*
bell-metal
,
summoning
the
ghosts
to
rise
and
walk
their
nightly
*NL*
round
.
--
In
plainer
language
,
it
was
twelve
o'clock
,
and
all
the
*NL*
family
,
as
we
have
said
,
lay
buried
in
drink
and
sleep
,
except
only
*NL*
Mrs
Western
,
who
was
deeply
engaged
in
reading
a
political
pamphlet
,
*NL*
and
except
our
heroine
,
who
now
softly
stole
down-stairs
,
and
,
having
*NL*
unbarred
and
unlocked
one
of
the
house-doors
,
sallied
forth
,
and
*NL*
hastened
to
the
place
of
appointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
many
pretty
arts
which
ladies
sometimes
practise
,
*NL*
to
display
their
fears
on
every
little
occasion
-LRB-
almost
as
many
as
the
*NL*
other
sex
uses
to
conceal
theirs
-RRB-
,
certainly
there
is
a
degree
of
*NL*
courage
which
not
only
becomes
a
woman
,
but
is
often
necessary
to
*NL*
enable
her
to
discharge
her
duty
.
It
is
,
indeed
,
the
idea
of
*NL*
fierceness
,
and
not
of
bravery
,
which
destroys
the
female
character
;
*NL*
for
who
can
read
the
story
of
the
justly
celebrated
Arria
without
*NL*
conceiving
as
high
an
opinion
of
her
gentleness
and
tenderness
as
of
*NL*
her
fortitude
?
At
the
same
time
,
perhaps
,
many
a
woman
who
shrieks
at
*NL*
a
mouse
,
or
a
rat
,
may
be
capable
of
poisoning
a
husband
;
or
,
what
is
*NL*
worse
,
of
driving
him
to
poison
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
with
all
the
gentleness
which
a
woman
can
have
,
had
all
the
*NL*
spirit
which
she
ought
to
have
.
When
,
therefore
,
she
came
to
the
place
*NL*
of
appointment
,
and
,
instead
of
meeting
her
maid
,
as
was
agreed
,
saw
a
*NL*
man
ride
directly
up
to
her
,
she
neither
screamed
out
nor
fainted
*NL*
away
:
not
that
her
pulse
then
beat
with
its
usual
regularity
;
for
she
*NL*
was
,
at
first
,
under
some
surprize
and
apprehension
:
but
these
were
*NL*
relieved
almost
as
soon
as
raised
,
when
the
man
,
pulling
off
his
hat
,
*NL*
asked
her
,
in
a
very
submissive
manner
,
``
If
her
ladyship
did
not
*NL*
expect
to
meet
another
lady
?
''
and
then
proceeded
to
inform
her
that
he
*NL*
was
sent
to
conduct
her
to
that
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
could
have
no
possible
suspicion
of
any
falsehood
in
this
*NL*
account
:
she
therefore
mounted
resolutely
behind
the
fellow
,
who
*NL*
conveyed
her
safe
to
a
town
about
five
miles
distant
,
where
she
had
*NL*
the
satisfaction
of
finding
the
good
Mrs
Honour
:
for
,
as
the
soul
of
*NL*
the
waiting-woman
was
wrapt
up
in
those
very
habiliments
which
used
to
*NL*
enwrap
her
body
,
she
could
by
no
means
bring
herself
to
trust
them
out
*NL*
of
her
sight
.
Upon
these
,
therefore
,
she
kept
guard
in
person
,
while
*NL*
she
detached
the
aforesaid
fellow
after
her
mistress
,
having
given
him
*NL*
all
proper
instructions
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
debated
what
course
to
take
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
pursuit
of
*NL*
Mr
Western
,
who
they
knew
would
send
after
them
in
a
few
hours
.
The
*NL*
London
road
had
such
charms
for
Honour
,
that
she
was
desirous
of
going
*NL*
on
directly
;
alleging
that
,
as
Sophia
could
not
be
missed
till
eight
*NL*
or
nine
the
next
morning
,
her
pursuers
would
not
be
able
to
overtake
*NL*
her
,
even
though
they
knew
which
way
she
had
gone
.
But
Sophia
had
too
*NL*
much
at
stake
to
venture
anything
to
chance
;
nor
did
she
dare
trust
*NL*
too
much
to
her
tender
limbs
,
in
a
contest
which
was
to
be
decided
*NL*
only
by
swiftness
.
She
resolved
,
therefore
,
to
travel
across
the
*NL*
country
,
for
at
least
twenty
or
thirty
miles
,
and
then
to
take
the
*NL*
direct
road
to
London
.
So
,
having
hired
horses
to
go
twenty
miles
one
*NL*
way
,
when
she
intended
to
go
twenty
miles
the
other
,
she
set
forward
*NL*
with
the
same
guide
behind
whom
she
had
ridden
from
her
father
's
*NL*
house
;
the
guide
having
now
taken
up
behind
him
,
in
the
room
of
*NL*
Sophia
,
a
much
heavier
,
as
well
as
much
less
lovely
burden
;
being
,
*NL*
indeed
,
a
huge
portmanteau
,
well
stuffed
with
those
outside
ornaments
,
*NL*
by
means
of
which
the
fair
Honour
hoped
to
gain
many
conquests
,
and
,
*NL*
finally
,
to
make
her
fortune
in
London
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
gone
about
two
hundred
paces
from
the
inn
on
the
London
*NL*
road
,
Sophia
rode
up
to
the
guide
,
and
,
with
a
voice
much
fuller
of
*NL*
honey
than
was
ever
that
of
Plato
,
though
his
mouth
is
supposed
to
*NL*
have
been
a
bee-hive
,
begged
him
to
take
the
first
turning
which
led
*NL*
towards
Bristol
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
I
am
not
superstitious
,
nor
any
great
believer
of
modern
*NL*
miracles
.
I
do
not
,
therefore
,
deliver
the
following
as
a
certain
*NL*
truth
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
can
scarce
credit
it
myself
:
but
the
fidelity
of
*NL*
an
historian
obliges
me
to
relate
what
hath
been
confidently
asserted
.
*NL*
The
horse
,
then
,
on
which
the
guide
rode
,
is
reported
to
have
been
so
*NL*
charmed
by
Sophia
's
voice
,
that
he
made
a
full
stop
,
and
expressed
an
*NL*
unwillingness
to
proceed
any
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
,
however
,
the
fact
may
be
true
,
and
less
miraculous
than
it
*NL*
hath
been
represented
;
since
the
natural
cause
seems
adequate
to
the
*NL*
effect
:
for
,
as
the
guide
at
that
moment
desisted
from
a
constant
*NL*
application
of
his
armed
right
heel
-LRB-
for
,
like
Hudibras
,
he
wore
but
*NL*
one
spur
-RRB-
,
it
is
more
than
possible
that
this
omission
alone
might
*NL*
occasion
the
beast
to
stop
,
especially
as
this
was
very
frequent
with
*NL*
him
at
other
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
the
voice
of
Sophia
had
really
an
effect
on
the
horse
,
it
had
*NL*
very
little
on
the
rider
.
He
answered
somewhat
surlily
,
``
That
measter
*NL*
had
ordered
him
to
go
a
different
way
,
and
that
he
should
lose
his
*NL*
place
if
he
went
any
other
than
that
he
was
ordered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
finding
all
her
persuasions
had
no
effect
,
began
now
to
add
*NL*
irresistible
charms
to
her
voice
;
charms
which
,
according
to
the
*NL*
proverb
,
makes
the
old
mare
trot
,
instead
of
standing
still
;
charms
!
*NL*
to
which
modern
ages
have
attributed
all
that
irresistible
force
which
*NL*
the
antients
imputed
to
perfect
oratory
.
In
a
word
,
she
promised
she
*NL*
would
reward
him
to
his
utmost
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
was
not
totally
deaf
to
these
promises
;
but
he
disliked
their
*NL*
being
indefinite
;
for
,
though
perhaps
he
had
never
heard
that
word
,
*NL*
yet
that
,
in
fact
,
was
his
objection
.
He
said
,
``
Gentlevolks
did
not
*NL*
consider
the
case
of
poor
volks
;
that
he
had
like
to
have
been
turned
*NL*
away
the
other
day
,
for
riding
about
the
country
with
a
gentleman
from
*NL*
Squire
Allworthy
's
,
who
did
not
reward
him
as
he
should
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
whom
?
''
says
Sophia
eagerly
.
``
With
a
gentleman
from
Squire
*NL*
Allworthy
's
,
''
repeated
the
lad
;
``
the
squire
's
son
,
I
think
they
call
*NL*
`
un
.
''
--
``
Whither
?
which
way
did
he
go
?
''
says
Sophia
.
--
``
Why
,
a
little
o
'
*NL*
one
side
o
'
Bristol
,
about
twenty
miles
off
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
lad
.
--
``
Guide
me
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
to
the
same
place
,
and
I
'll
give
thee
*NL*
a
guinea
,
or
two
,
if
one
is
not
sufficient
.
''
--
``
To
be
certain
,
''
said
*NL*
the
boy
,
``
it
is
honestly
worth
two
,
when
your
ladyship
considers
what
*NL*
a
risk
I
run
;
but
,
however
,
if
your
ladyship
will
promise
me
the
two
*NL*
guineas
,
I
'll
e
`
en
venture
:
to
be
certain
it
is
a
sinful
thing
to
ride
*NL*
about
my
measter
's
horses
;
but
one
comfort
is
,
I
can
only
be
turned
*NL*
away
,
and
two
guineas
will
partly
make
me
amends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bargain
being
thus
struck
,
the
lad
turned
aside
into
the
Bristol
*NL*
road
,
and
Sophia
set
forward
in
pursuit
of
Jones
,
highly
contrary
to
*NL*
the
remonstrances
of
Mrs
Honour
,
who
had
much
more
desire
to
see
London
*NL*
than
to
see
Mr
Jones
:
for
indeed
she
was
not
his
friend
with
her
*NL*
mistress
,
as
he
had
been
guilty
of
some
neglect
in
certain
pecuniary
*NL*
civilities
,
which
are
by
custom
due
to
the
waiting-gentlewoman
in
all
*NL*
love
affairs
,
and
more
especially
in
those
of
a
clandestine
kind
.
This
*NL*
we
impute
rather
to
the
carelessness
of
his
temper
than
to
any
want
of
*NL*
generosity
;
but
perhaps
she
derived
it
from
the
latter
motive
.
Certain
*NL*
it
is
that
she
hated
him
very
bitterly
on
that
account
,
and
resolved
to
*NL*
take
every
opportunity
of
injuring
him
with
her
mistress
.
It
was
*NL*
therefore
highly
unlucky
for
her
,
that
she
had
gone
to
the
very
same
*NL*
town
and
inn
whence
Jones
had
started
,
and
still
more
unlucky
was
she
*NL*
in
having
stumbled
on
the
same
guide
,
and
on
this
accidental
discovery
*NL*
which
Sophia
had
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
travellers
arrived
at
Hambrook
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
at
the
break
of
day
,
where
*NL*
Honour
was
against
her
will
charged
to
enquire
the
route
which
Mr
*NL*
Jones
had
taken
.
Of
this
,
indeed
,
the
guide
himself
could
have
*NL*
informed
them
;
but
Sophia
,
I
know
not
for
what
reason
,
never
asked
him
*NL*
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
This
was
the
village
where
Jones
met
the
Quaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs
Honour
had
made
her
report
from
the
landlord
,
Sophia
,
with
*NL*
much
difficulty
,
procured
some
indifferent
horses
,
which
brought
her
*NL*
to
the
inn
where
Jones
had
been
confined
rather
by
the
misfortune
of
*NL*
meeting
with
a
surgeon
than
by
having
met
with
a
broken
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Honour
,
being
again
charged
with
a
commission
of
enquiry
,
had
no
*NL*
sooner
applied
herself
to
the
landlady
,
and
had
described
the
person
*NL*
of
Mr
Jones
,
than
that
sagacious
woman
began
,
in
the
vulgar
phrase
,
to
*NL*
smell
a
rat
.
When
Sophia
therefore
entered
the
room
,
instead
of
*NL*
answering
the
maid
,
the
landlady
,
addressing
herself
to
the
mistress
,
*NL*
began
the
following
speech
:
``
Good
lack-a-day
!
why
there
now
,
who
would
*NL*
have
thought
it
?
I
protest
the
loveliest
couple
that
ever
eye
beheld
.
*NL*
I-fackins
,
madam
,
it
is
no
wonder
the
squire
run
on
so
about
your
*NL*
ladyship
.
He
told
me
indeed
you
was
the
finest
lady
in
the
world
,
and
*NL*
to
be
sure
so
you
be
.
Mercy
on
him
,
poor
heart
!
I
bepitied
him
,
so
I
*NL*
did
,
when
he
used
to
hug
his
pillow
,
and
call
it
his
dear
Madam
*NL*
Sophia
.
I
did
all
I
could
to
dissuade
him
from
going
to
the
wars
:
I
*NL*
told
him
there
were
men
enow
that
were
good
for
nothing
else
but
to
be
*NL*
killed
,
that
had
not
the
love
of
such
fine
ladies
.
''
``
Sure
,
''
says
*NL*
Sophia
,
``
the
good
woman
is
distracted
.
''
``
No
,
no
,
''
cries
the
landlady
,
*NL*
``
I
am
not
distracted
.
What
,
doth
your
ladyship
think
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
then
?
I
assure
you
he
told
me
all
.
''
``
What
saucy
fellow
,
''
cries
Honour
,
*NL*
``
told
you
anything
of
my
lady
?
''
``
No
saucy
fellow
,
''
answered
the
*NL*
landlady
,
``
but
the
young
gentleman
you
enquired
after
,
and
a
very
*NL*
pretty
young
gentleman
he
is
,
and
he
loves
Madam
Sophia
Western
to
the
*NL*
bottom
of
his
soul
.
''
``
He
love
my
lady
!
I
'd
have
you
to
know
,
woman
,
*NL*
she
is
meat
for
his
master
.
''
--
``
Nay
,
Honour
,
''
said
Sophia
,
interrupting
*NL*
her
,
``
do
n't
be
angry
with
the
good
woman
;
she
intends
no
harm
.
''
``
No
,
*NL*
marry
,
do
n't
I
,
''
answered
the
landlady
,
emboldened
by
the
soft
accents
*NL*
of
Sophia
;
and
then
launched
into
a
long
narrative
too
tedious
to
be
*NL*
here
set
down
,
in
which
some
passages
dropt
that
gave
a
little
offence
*NL*
to
Sophia
,
and
much
more
to
her
waiting-woman
,
who
hence
took
occasion
*NL*
to
abuse
poor
Jones
to
her
mistress
the
moment
they
were
alone
*NL*
together
,
saying
,
``
that
he
must
be
a
very
pitiful
fellow
,
and
could
*NL*
have
no
love
for
a
lady
,
whose
name
he
would
thus
prostitute
in
an
*NL*
ale-house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
did
not
see
his
behaviour
in
so
very
disadvantageous
a
light
,
*NL*
and
was
perhaps
more
pleased
with
the
violent
raptures
of
his
love
*NL*
-LRB-
which
the
landlady
exaggerated
as
much
as
she
had
done
every
other
*NL*
circumstance
-RRB-
than
she
was
offended
with
the
rest
;
and
indeed
she
*NL*
imputed
the
whole
to
the
extravagance
,
or
rather
ebullience
,
of
his
*NL*
passion
,
and
to
the
openness
of
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
incident
,
however
,
being
afterwards
revived
in
her
mind
,
and
*NL*
placed
in
the
most
odious
colours
by
Honour
,
served
to
heighten
and
*NL*
give
credit
to
those
unlucky
occurrences
at
Upton
,
and
assisted
the
*NL*
waiting-woman
in
her
endeavours
to
make
her
mistress
depart
from
that
*NL*
inn
without
seeing
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
finding
Sophia
intended
to
stay
no
longer
than
till
her
*NL*
horses
were
ready
,
and
that
without
either
eating
or
drinking
,
soon
*NL*
withdrew
;
when
Honour
began
to
take
her
mistress
to
task
-LRB-
for
indeed
*NL*
she
used
great
freedom
-RRB-
,
and
after
a
long
harangue
,
in
which
she
*NL*
reminded
her
of
her
intention
to
go
to
London
,
and
gave
frequent
hints
*NL*
of
the
impropriety
of
pursuing
a
young
fellow
,
she
at
last
concluded
*NL*
with
this
serious
exhortation
:
``
For
heaven
's
sake
,
madam
,
consider
*NL*
what
you
are
about
,
and
whither
you
are
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
advice
to
a
lady
who
had
already
rode
near
forty
miles
,
and
in
no
*NL*
very
agreeable
season
,
may
seem
foolish
enough
.
It
may
be
supposed
she
*NL*
had
well
considered
and
resolved
this
already
;
nay
,
Mrs
Honour
,
by
the
*NL*
hints
she
threw
out
,
seemed
to
think
so
;
and
this
I
doubt
not
is
the
*NL*
opinion
of
many
readers
,
who
have
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
been
long
since
*NL*
well
convinced
of
the
purpose
of
our
heroine
,
and
have
heartily
*NL*
condemned
her
for
it
as
a
wanton
baggage
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
reality
this
was
not
the
case
.
Sophia
had
been
lately
so
*NL*
distracted
between
hope
and
fear
,
her
duty
and
love
to
her
father
,
her
*NL*
hatred
to
Blifil
,
her
compassion
,
and
-LRB-
why
should
we
not
confess
the
*NL*
truth
?
-RRB-
her
love
for
Jones
;
which
last
the
behaviour
of
her
father
,
of
*NL*
her
aunt
,
of
every
one
else
,
and
more
particularly
of
Jones
himself
,
*NL*
had
blown
into
a
flame
,
that
her
mind
was
in
that
confused
state
which
*NL*
may
be
truly
said
to
make
us
ignorant
of
what
we
do
,
or
whither
we
go
,
*NL*
or
rather
,
indeed
,
indifferent
as
to
the
consequence
of
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prudent
and
sage
advice
of
her
maid
produced
,
however
,
some
cool
*NL*
reflection
;
and
she
at
length
determined
to
go
to
Gloucester
,
and
*NL*
thence
to
proceed
directly
to
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
unluckily
,
a
few
miles
before
she
entered
that
town
,
she
met
the
*NL*
hack-attorney
,
who
,
as
is
before
mentioned
,
had
dined
there
with
Mr
*NL*
Jones
.
This
fellow
,
being
well
known
to
Mrs
Honour
,
stopt
and
spoke
to
*NL*
her
;
of
which
Sophia
at
that
time
took
little
notice
,
more
than
to
*NL*
enquire
who
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
having
had
a
more
particular
account
from
Honour
of
this
man
*NL*
afterwards
at
Gloucester
,
and
hearing
of
the
great
expedition
he
*NL*
usually
made
in
travelling
,
for
which
-LRB-
as
hath
been
before
observed
-RRB-
*NL*
he
was
particularly
famous
;
recollecting
,
likewise
,
that
she
had
*NL*
overheard
Mrs
Honour
inform
him
that
they
were
going
to
Gloucester
,
*NL*
she
began
to
fear
lest
her
father
might
,
by
this
fellow
's
means
,
be
*NL*
able
to
trace
her
to
that
city
;
wherefore
,
if
she
should
there
strike
*NL*
into
the
London
road
,
she
apprehended
he
would
certainly
be
able
to
*NL*
overtake
her
.
She
therefore
altered
her
resolution
;
and
,
having
hired
*NL*
horses
to
go
a
week
's
journey
a
way
which
she
did
not
intend
to
*NL*
travel
,
she
again
set
forward
after
a
light
refreshment
,
contrary
to
*NL*
the
desire
and
earnest
entreaties
of
her
maid
,
and
to
the
no
less
*NL*
vehement
remonstrances
of
Mrs
Whitefield
,
who
,
from
good
breeding
,
or
*NL*
perhaps
from
good
nature
-LRB-
for
the
poor
young
lady
appeared
much
*NL*
fatigued
-RRB-
,
pressed
her
very
heartily
to
stay
that
evening
at
*NL*
Gloucester
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
refreshed
herself
only
with
some
tea
,
and
with
lying
about
two
*NL*
hours
on
the
bed
,
while
her
horses
were
getting
ready
,
she
resolutely
*NL*
left
Mrs
Whitefield
's
about
eleven
at
night
,
and
,
striking
directly
*NL*
into
the
Worcester
road
,
within
less
than
four
hours
arrived
at
that
*NL*
very
inn
where
we
last
saw
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
thus
traced
our
heroine
very
particularly
back
from
her
*NL*
departure
,
till
her
arrival
at
Upton
,
we
shall
in
a
very
few
words
*NL*
bring
her
father
to
the
same
place
;
who
,
having
received
the
first
*NL*
scent
from
the
post-boy
,
who
conducted
his
daughter
to
Hambrook
,
very
*NL*
easily
traced
her
afterwards
to
Gloucester
;
whence
he
pursued
her
to
*NL*
Upton
,
as
he
had
learned
Mr
Jones
had
taken
that
route
-LRB-
for
Partridge
,
*NL*
to
use
the
squire
's
expression
,
left
everywhere
a
strong
scent
behind
*NL*
him
-RRB-
,
and
he
doubted
not
in
the
least
but
Sophia
travelled
,
or
,
as
he
*NL*
phrased
it
,
ran
,
the
same
way
.
He
used
indeed
a
very
coarse
*NL*
expression
,
which
need
not
be
here
inserted
;
as
fox-hunters
,
who
alone
*NL*
will
understand
it
,
will
easily
suggest
it
to
themselves
.

CONTAINING
ABOUT
THREE
DAYS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
crust
for
the
critics
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
our
last
initial
chapter
we
may
be
supposed
to
have
treated
that
*NL*
formidable
set
of
men
who
are
called
critics
with
more
freedom
than
*NL*
becomes
us
;
since
they
exact
,
and
indeed
generally
receive
,
great
*NL*
condescension
from
authors
.
We
shall
in
this
,
therefore
,
give
the
*NL*
reasons
of
our
conduct
to
this
august
body
;
and
here
we
shall
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
place
them
in
a
light
in
which
they
have
not
hitherto
been
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
word
critic
is
of
Greek
derivation
,
and
signifies
judgment
.
Hence
*NL*
I
presume
some
persons
who
have
not
understood
the
original
,
and
have
*NL*
seen
the
English
translation
of
the
primitive
,
have
concluded
that
it
*NL*
meant
judgment
in
the
legal
sense
,
in
which
it
is
frequently
used
as
*NL*
equivalent
to
condemnation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
the
rather
inclined
to
be
of
that
opinion
,
as
the
greatest
number
*NL*
of
critics
hath
of
late
years
been
found
amongst
the
lawyers
.
Many
of
*NL*
these
gentlemen
,
from
despair
,
perhaps
,
of
ever
rising
to
the
bench
in
*NL*
Westminster-hall
,
have
placed
themselves
on
the
benches
at
the
*NL*
playhouse
,
where
they
have
exerted
their
judicial
capacity
,
and
have
*NL*
given
judgment
,
_
i.e.
_
,
condemned
without
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentlemen
would
,
perhaps
,
be
well
enough
pleased
,
if
we
were
to
*NL*
leave
them
thus
compared
to
one
of
the
most
important
and
honourable
*NL*
offices
in
the
commonwealth
,
and
,
if
we
intended
to
apply
to
their
*NL*
favour
,
we
would
do
so
;
but
,
as
we
design
to
deal
very
sincerely
and
*NL*
plainly
too
with
them
,
we
must
remind
them
of
another
officer
of
*NL*
justice
of
a
much
lower
rank
;
to
whom
,
as
they
not
only
pronounce
,
but
*NL*
execute
,
their
own
judgment
,
they
bear
likewise
some
remote
*NL*
resemblance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
reality
there
is
another
light
,
in
which
these
modern
critics
*NL*
may
,
with
great
justice
and
propriety
,
be
seen
;
and
this
is
that
of
a
*NL*
common
slanderer
.
If
a
person
who
prys
into
the
characters
of
others
,
*NL*
with
no
other
design
but
to
discover
their
faults
,
and
to
publish
them
*NL*
to
the
world
,
deserves
the
title
of
a
slanderer
of
the
reputations
of
*NL*
men
,
why
should
not
a
critic
,
who
reads
with
the
same
malevolent
view
,
*NL*
be
as
properly
stiled
the
slanderer
of
the
reputation
of
books
?
*NL*
*NL*
Vice
hath
not
,
I
believe
,
a
more
abject
slave
;
society
produces
not
a
*NL*
more
odious
vermin
;
nor
can
the
devil
receive
a
guest
more
worthy
of
*NL*
him
,
nor
possibly
more
welcome
to
him
,
than
a
slanderer
.
The
world
,
I
*NL*
am
afraid
,
regards
not
this
monster
with
half
the
abhorrence
which
he
*NL*
deserves
;
and
I
am
more
afraid
to
assign
the
reason
of
this
criminal
*NL*
lenity
shown
towards
him
;
yet
it
is
certain
that
the
thief
looks
*NL*
innocent
in
the
comparison
;
nay
,
the
murderer
himself
can
seldom
stand
*NL*
in
competition
with
his
guilt
:
for
slander
is
a
more
cruel
weapon
than
*NL*
a
sword
,
as
the
wounds
which
the
former
gives
are
always
incurable
.
*NL*
One
method
,
indeed
,
there
is
of
killing
,
and
that
the
basest
and
most
*NL*
execrable
of
all
,
which
bears
an
exact
analogy
to
the
vice
here
*NL*
disclaimed
against
,
and
that
is
poison
:
a
means
of
revenge
so
base
,
*NL*
and
yet
so
horrible
,
that
it
was
once
wisely
distinguished
by
our
laws
*NL*
from
all
other
murders
,
in
the
peculiar
severity
of
the
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
dreadful
mischiefs
done
by
slander
,
and
the
baseness
of
*NL*
the
means
by
which
they
are
effected
,
there
are
other
circumstances
*NL*
that
highly
aggravate
its
atrocious
quality
;
for
it
often
proceeds
*NL*
from
no
provocation
,
and
seldom
promises
itself
any
reward
,
unless
*NL*
some
black
and
infernal
mind
may
propose
a
reward
in
the
thoughts
of
*NL*
having
procured
the
ruin
and
misery
of
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shakespear
hath
nobly
touched
this
vice
,
when
he
says
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
steals
my
purse
steals
trash
;
'
t
is
something
,
nothing
;
*NL*
'T
was
mine
,
't
is
his
,
and
hath
been
slave
to
thousands
:
*NL*
But
he
that
filches
from
me
my
good
name
*NL*
Robs
me
of
that
WHICH
NOT
ENRICHES
HIM
,
*NL*
BUT
MAKES
ME
POOR
INDEED
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
this
my
good
reader
will
doubtless
agree
;
but
much
of
it
will
*NL*
probably
seem
too
severe
,
when
applied
to
the
slanderer
of
books
.
But
*NL*
let
it
here
be
considered
that
both
proceed
from
the
same
wicked
*NL*
disposition
of
mind
,
and
are
alike
void
of
the
excuse
of
temptation
.
*NL*
Nor
shall
we
conclude
the
injury
done
this
way
to
be
very
slight
,
when
*NL*
we
consider
a
book
as
the
author
's
offspring
,
and
indeed
as
the
child
*NL*
of
his
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
who
hath
suffered
his
muse
to
continue
hitherto
in
a
virgin
*NL*
state
can
have
but
a
very
inadequate
idea
of
this
kind
of
paternal
*NL*
fondness
.
To
such
we
may
parody
the
tender
exclamation
of
Macduff
,
*NL*
``
Alas
!
Thou
hast
written
no
book
.
''
But
the
author
whose
muse
hath
*NL*
brought
forth
will
feel
the
pathetic
strain
,
perhaps
will
accompany
me
*NL*
with
tears
-LRB-
especially
if
his
darling
be
already
no
more
-RRB-
,
while
I
*NL*
mention
the
uneasiness
with
which
the
big
muse
bears
about
her
burden
,
*NL*
the
painful
labour
with
which
she
produces
it
,
and
,
lastly
,
the
care
,
*NL*
the
fondness
,
with
which
the
tender
father
nourishes
his
favourite
,
*NL*
till
it
be
brought
to
maturity
,
and
produced
into
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
is
there
any
paternal
fondness
which
seems
less
to
savour
of
*NL*
absolute
instinct
,
and
which
may
so
well
be
reconciled
to
worldly
*NL*
wisdom
,
as
this
.
These
children
may
most
truly
be
called
the
riches
of
*NL*
their
father
;
and
many
of
them
have
with
true
filial
piety
fed
their
*NL*
parent
in
his
old
age
:
so
that
not
only
the
affection
,
but
the
*NL*
interest
,
of
the
author
may
be
highly
injured
by
these
slanderers
,
*NL*
whose
poisonous
breath
brings
his
book
to
an
untimely
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lastly
,
the
slander
of
a
book
is
,
in
truth
,
the
slander
of
the
author
:
*NL*
for
,
as
no
one
can
call
another
bastard
,
without
calling
the
mother
a
*NL*
whore
,
so
neither
can
any
one
give
the
names
of
sad
stuff
,
horrid
*NL*
nonsense
,
&
c.
,
to
a
book
,
without
calling
the
author
a
blockhead
;
*NL*
which
,
though
in
a
moral
sense
it
is
a
preferable
appellation
to
that
*NL*
of
villain
,
is
perhaps
rather
more
injurious
to
his
worldly
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
however
ludicrous
all
this
may
appear
to
some
,
others
,
I
doubt
*NL*
not
,
will
feel
and
acknowledge
the
truth
of
it
;
nay
,
may
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
think
I
have
not
treated
the
subject
with
decent
solemnity
;
but
surely
*NL*
a
man
may
speak
truth
with
a
smiling
countenance
.
In
reality
,
to
*NL*
depreciate
a
book
maliciously
,
or
even
wantonly
,
is
at
least
a
very
*NL*
ill-natured
office
;
and
a
morose
snarling
critic
may
,
I
believe
,
be
*NL*
suspected
to
be
a
bad
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
therefore
endeavour
,
in
the
remaining
part
of
this
chapter
,
to
*NL*
explain
the
marks
of
this
character
,
and
to
show
what
criticism
I
here
*NL*
intend
to
obviate
:
for
I
can
never
be
understood
,
unless
by
the
very
*NL*
persons
here
meant
,
to
insinuate
that
there
are
no
proper
judges
of
*NL*
writing
,
or
to
endeavour
to
exclude
from
the
commonwealth
of
*NL*
literature
any
of
those
noble
critics
to
whose
labours
the
learned
*NL*
world
are
so
greatly
indebted
.
Such
were
Aristotle
,
Horace
,
and
*NL*
Longinus
,
among
the
antients
,
Dacier
and
Bossu
among
the
French
,
and
*NL*
some
perhaps
among
us
;
who
have
certainly
been
duly
authorised
to
*NL*
execute
at
least
a
judicial
authority
_
in
foro
literario
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
without
ascertaining
all
the
proper
qualifications
of
a
critic
,
*NL*
which
I
have
touched
on
elsewhere
,
I
think
I
may
very
boldly
object
to
*NL*
the
censures
of
any
one
past
upon
works
which
he
hath
not
himself
*NL*
read
.
Such
censurers
as
these
,
whether
they
speak
from
their
own
guess
*NL*
or
suspicion
,
or
from
the
report
and
opinion
of
others
,
may
properly
*NL*
be
said
to
slander
the
reputation
of
the
book
they
condemn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
may
likewise
be
suspected
of
deserving
this
character
,
who
,
*NL*
without
assigning
any
particular
faults
,
condemn
the
whole
in
general
*NL*
defamatory
terms
;
such
as
vile
,
dull
,
d
--
d
stuff
,
&
c.
,
and
*NL*
particularly
by
the
use
of
the
monosyllable
low
;
a
word
which
becomes
*NL*
the
mouth
of
no
critic
who
is
not
RIGHT
HONOURABLE
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
though
there
may
be
some
faults
justly
assigned
in
the
work
,
*NL*
yet
,
if
those
are
not
in
the
most
essential
parts
,
or
if
they
are
*NL*
compensated
by
greater
beauties
,
it
will
savour
rather
of
the
malice
*NL*
of
a
slanderer
than
of
the
judgment
of
a
true
critic
to
pass
a
severe
*NL*
sentence
upon
the
whole
,
merely
on
account
of
some
vicious
part
.
This
*NL*
is
directly
contrary
to
the
sentiments
of
Horace
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
Verum
ubi
plura
nitent

carmine
,
non
ego

*NL*

,

aut
incuria
fudit
,
*NL*
Aut
humana
parum

_
*NL*
*NL*
But
where
the
beauties
,
more
in
number
,
shine
,
*NL*
I
am
not
angry
,
when
a
casual
line
*NL*
-LRB-
That
with
some
trivial
faults
unequal
flows
-RRB-
*NL*
A
careless
hand
or
human
frailty
shows
.

*NL*
For
,
as
Martial
says
,
_
Aliter
non
fit
,
Avite
,

_
.
No
book
can
be
*NL*
otherwise
composed
.
All
beauty
of
character
,
as
well
as
of
*NL*
countenance
,
and
indeed
of
everything
human
,
is
to
be
tried
in
this
*NL*
manner
.
Cruel
indeed
would
it
be
if
such
a
work
as
this
history
,
which
*NL*
hath
employed
some
thousands
of
hours
in
the
composing
,
should
be
*NL*
liable
to
be
condemned
,
because
some
particular
chapter
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
chapters
,
may
be
obnoxious
to
very
just
and
sensible
objections
.
And
*NL*
yet
nothing
is
more
common
than
the
most
rigorous
sentence
upon
books
*NL*
supported
by
such
objections
,
which
,
if
they
were
rightly
taken
-LRB-
and
*NL*
that
they
are
not
always
-RRB-
,
do
by
no
means
go
to
the
merit
of
the
*NL*
whole
.
In
the
theatre
especially
,
a
single
expression
which
doth
not
*NL*
coincide
with
the
taste
of
the
audience
,
or
with
any
individual
critic
*NL*
of
that
audience
,
is
sure
to
be
hissed
;
and
one
scene
which
should
be
*NL*
disapproved
would
hazard
the
whole
piece
.
To
write
within
such
severe
*NL*
rules
as
these
is
as
impossible
as
to
live
up
to
some
splenetic
*NL*
opinions
:
and
if
we
judge
according
to
the
sentiments
of
some
critics
,
*NL*
and
of
some
Christians
,
no
author
will
be
saved
in
this
world
,
and
no
*NL*
man
in
the
next

Chapter
ii
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adventures
which
Sophia
met
with
after
her
leaving
Upton
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Our
history
,
just
before
it
was
obliged
to
turn
about
and
travel
*NL*
backwards
,
had
mentioned
the
departure
of
Sophia
and
her
maid
from
the
*NL*
inn
;
we
shall
now
therefore
pursue
the
steps
of
that
lovely
creature
,
*NL*
and
leave
her
unworthy
lover
a
little
longer
to
bemoan
his
ill-luck
,
*NL*
or
rather
his
ill-conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
having
directed
her
guide
to
travel
through
bye-roads
,
across
*NL*
the
country
,
they
now
passed
the
Severn
,
and
had
scarce
got
a
mile
*NL*
from
the
inn
,
when
the
young
lady
,
looking
behind
her
,
saw
several
*NL*
horses
coming
after
on
full
speed
.
This
greatly
alarmed
her
fears
,
and
*NL*
she
called
to
the
guide
to
put
on
as
fast
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
obeyed
her
,
and
away
they
rode
a
full
gallop
.
But
the
*NL*
faster
they
went
,
the
faster
were
they
followed
;
and
as
the
horses
*NL*
behind
were
somewhat
swifter
than
those
before
,
so
the
former
were
at
*NL*
length
overtaken
.
A
happy
circumstance
for
poor
Sophia
;
whose
fears
,
*NL*
joined
to
her
fatigue
,
had
almost
overpowered
her
spirits
;
but
she
was
*NL*
now
instantly
relieved
by
a
female
voice
,
that
greeted
her
in
the
*NL*
softest
manner
,
and
with
the
utmost
civility
.
This
greeting
Sophia
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
she
could
recover
her
breath
,
with
like
civility
,
and
with
the
*NL*
highest
satisfaction
to
herself
,
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
travellers
who
joined
Sophia
,
and
who
had
given
her
such
terror
,
*NL*
consisted
,
like
her
own
company
,
of
two
females
and
a
guide
.
The
two
*NL*
parties
proceeded
three
full
miles
together
before
any
one
offered
*NL*
again
to
open
their
mouths
;
when
our
heroine
,
having
pretty
well
got
*NL*
the
better
of
her
fear
-LRB-
but
yet
being
somewhat
surprized
that
the
*NL*
other
still
continued
to
attend
her
,
as
she
pursued
no
great
road
,
and
*NL*
had
already
passed
through
several
turnings
-RRB-
,
accosted
the
strange
*NL*
lady
in
a
most
obliging
tone
,
and
said
,
``
She
was
very
happy
to
find
*NL*
they
were
both
travelling
the
same
way
.
''
The
other
,
who
,
like
a
ghost
,
*NL*
only
wanted
to
be
spoke
to
,
readily
answered
,
``
That
the
happiness
was
*NL*
entirely
hers
;
that
she
was
a
perfect
stranger
in
that
country
,
and
*NL*
was
so
overjoyed
at
meeting
a
companion
of
her
own
sex
,
that
she
had
*NL*
perhaps
been
guilty
of
an
impertinence
,
which
required
great
apology
,
*NL*
in
keeping
pace
with
her
.
''
More
civilities
passed
between
these
two
*NL*
ladies
;
for
Mrs
Honour
had
now
given
place
to
the
fine
habit
of
the
*NL*
stranger
,
and
had
fallen
into
the
rear
.
But
,
though
Sophia
had
great
*NL*
curiosity
to
know
why
the
other
lady
continued
to
travel
on
through
*NL*
the
same
bye-roads
with
herself
,
nay
,
though
this
gave
her
some
*NL*
uneasiness
,
yet
fear
,
or
modesty
,
or
some
other
consideration
,
*NL*
restrained
her
from
asking
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
strange
lady
now
laboured
under
a
difficulty
which
appears
almost
*NL*
below
the
dignity
of
history
to
mention
.
Her
bonnet
had
been
blown
*NL*
from
her
head
not
less
than
five
times
within
the
last
mile
;
nor
could
*NL*
she
come
at
any
ribbon
or
handkerchief
to
tie
it
under
her
chin
.
When
*NL*
Sophia
was
informed
of
this
,
she
immediately
supplied
her
with
a
*NL*
handkerchief
for
this
purpose
;
which
while
she
was
pulling
from
her
*NL*
pocket
,
she
perhaps
too
much
neglected
the
management
of
her
horse
,
*NL*
for
the
beast
,
now
unluckily
making
a
false
step
,
fell
upon
his
*NL*
fore-legs
,
and
threw
his
fair
rider
from
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Sophia
came
head
foremost
to
the
ground
,
she
happily
received
*NL*
not
the
least
damage
:
and
the
same
circumstances
which
had
perhaps
*NL*
contributed
to
her
fall
now
preserved
her
from
confusion
;
for
the
lane
*NL*
which
they
were
then
passing
was
narrow
,
and
very
much
overgrown
with
*NL*
trees
,
so
that
the
moon
could
here
afford
very
little
light
,
and
was
*NL*
moreover
,
at
present
,
so
obscured
in
a
cloud
,
that
it
was
almost
*NL*
perfectly
dark
.
By
these
means
the
young
lady
's
modesty
,
which
was
*NL*
extremely
delicate
,
escaped
as
free
from
injury
as
her
limbs
,
and
she
*NL*
was
once
more
reinstated
in
her
saddle
,
having
received
no
other
harm
*NL*
than
a
little
fright
by
her
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daylight
at
length
appeared
in
its
full
lustre
;
and
now
the
two
*NL*
ladies
,
who
were
riding
over
a
common
side
by
side
,
looking
stedfastly
*NL*
at
each
other
,
at
the
same
moment
both
their
eyes
became
fixed
;
both
*NL*
their
horses
stopt
,
and
,
both
speaking
together
,
with
equal
joy
*NL*
pronounced
,
the
one
the
name
of
Sophia
,
the
other
that
of
Harriet
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unexpected
encounter
surprized
the
ladies
much
more
than
I
*NL*
believe
it
will
the
sagacious
reader
,
who
must
have
imagined
that
the
*NL*
strange
lady
could
be
no
other
than
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
the
cousin
of
*NL*
Miss
Western
,
whom
we
before
mentioned
to
have
sallied
from
the
inn
a
*NL*
few
minutes
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
great
was
the
surprize
and
joy
which
these
two
cousins
conceived
at
*NL*
this
meeting
-LRB-
for
they
had
formerly
been
most
intimate
acquaintance
*NL*
and
friends
,
and
had
long
lived
together
with
their
aunt
Western
-RRB-
,
*NL*
that
it
is
impossible
to
recount
half
the
congratulations
which
passed
*NL*
between
them
,
before
either
asked
a
very
natural
question
of
the
*NL*
other
,
namely
,
whither
she
was
going
?
*NL*
*NL*
This
at
last
,
however
,
came
first
from
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
but
,
easy
and
*NL*
natural
as
the
question
may
seem
,
Sophia
found
it
difficult
to
give
it
*NL*
a
very
ready
and
certain
answer
.
She
begged
her
cousin
therefore
to
*NL*
suspend
all
curiosity
till
they
arrived
at
some
inn
,
``
which
I
*NL*
suppose
,
''
says
she
,
``
can
hardly
be
far
distant
;
and
,
believe
me
,
*NL*
Harriet
,
I
suspend
as
much
curiosity
on
my
side
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
*NL*
believe
our
astonishment
is
pretty
equal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
which
passed
between
these
ladies
on
the
road
was
,
I
*NL*
apprehend
,
little
worth
relating
;
and
less
certainly
was
that
between
*NL*
the
two
waiting-women
;
for
they
likewise
began
to
pay
their
*NL*
compliments
to
each
other
.
As
for
the
guides
,
they
were
debarred
from
*NL*
the
pleasure
of
discourse
,
the
one
being
placed
in
the
van
,
and
the
*NL*
other
obliged
to
bring
up
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
posture
they
travelled
many
hours
,
till
they
came
into
a
wide
*NL*
and
well-beaten
road
,
which
,
as
they
turned
to
the
right
,
soon
brought
*NL*
them
to
a
very
fair
promising
inn
,
where
they
all
alighted
:
but
so
*NL*
fatigued
was
Sophia
,
that
as
she
had
sat
her
horse
during
the
last
*NL*
five
or
six
miles
with
great
difficulty
,
so
was
she
now
incapable
of
*NL*
dismounting
from
him
without
assistance
.
This
the
landlord
,
who
had
*NL*
hold
of
her
horse
,
presently
perceiving
,
offered
to
lift
her
in
his
*NL*
arms
from
her
saddle
;
and
she
too
readily
accepted
the
tender
of
his
*NL*
service
.
Indeed
fortune
seems
to
have
resolved
to
put
Sophia
to
the
*NL*
blush
that
day
,
and
the
second
malicious
attempt
succeeded
better
than
*NL*
the
first
;
for
my
landlord
had
no
sooner
received
the
young
lady
in
*NL*
his
arms
,
than
his
feet
,
which
the
gout
had
lately
very
severely
*NL*
handled
,
gave
way
,
and
down
he
tumbled
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
with
no
*NL*
less
dexterity
than
gallantry
,
contrived
to
throw
himself
under
his
*NL*
charming
burden
,
so
that
he
alone
received
any
bruise
from
the
fall
;
*NL*
for
the
great
injury
which
happened
to
Sophia
was
a
violent
shock
*NL*
given
to
her
modesty
by
an
immoderate
grin
,
which
,
at
her
rising
from
*NL*
the
ground
,
she
observed
in
the
countenances
of
most
of
the
*NL*
bye-standers
.
This
made
her
suspect
what
had
really
happened
,
and
what
*NL*
we
shall
not
here
relate
for
the
indulgence
of
those
readers
who
are
*NL*
capable
of
laughing
at
the
offence
given
to
a
young
lady
's
delicacy
.
*NL*
Accidents
of
this
kind
we
have
never
regarded
in
a
comical
light
;
nor
*NL*
will
we
scruple
to
say
that
he
must
have
a
very
inadequate
idea
of
the
*NL*
modesty
of
a
beautiful
young
woman
,
who
would
wish
to
sacrifice
it
to
*NL*
so
paltry
a
satisfaction
as
can
arise
from
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
fright
and
shock
,
joined
to
the
violent
fatigue
which
both
her
*NL*
mind
and
body
had
undergone
,
almost
overcame
the
excellent
*NL*
constitution
of
Sophia
,
and
she
had
scarce
strength
sufficient
to
*NL*
totter
into
the
inn
,
leaning
on
the
arm
of
her
maid
.
Here
she
was
no
*NL*
sooner
seated
than
she
called
for
a
glass
of
water
;
but
Mrs
Honour
,
*NL*
very
judiciously
,
in
my
opinion
,
changed
it
into
a
glass
of
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
hearing
from
Mrs
Honour
that
Sophia
had
not
been
in
*NL*
bed
during
the
two
last
nights
,
and
observing
her
to
look
very
pale
*NL*
and
wan
with
her
fatigue
,
earnestly
entreated
her
to
refresh
herself
*NL*
with
some
sleep
.
She
was
yet
a
stranger
to
her
history
,
or
her
*NL*
apprehensions
;
but
,
had
she
known
both
,
she
would
have
given
the
same
*NL*
advice
;
for
rest
was
visibly
necessary
for
her
;
and
their
long
journey
*NL*
through
bye-roads
so
entirely
removed
all
danger
of
pursuit
,
that
she
*NL*
was
herself
perfectly
easy
on
that
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
was
easily
prevailed
on
to
follow
the
counsel
of
her
friend
,
*NL*
which
was
heartily
seconded
by
her
maid
.
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
likewise
*NL*
offered
to
bear
her
cousin
company
,
which
Sophia
,
with
much
*NL*
complacence
,
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mistress
was
no
sooner
in
bed
than
the
maid
prepared
to
follow
her
*NL*
example
.
She
began
to
make
many
apologies
to
her
sister
Abigail
for
*NL*
leaving
her
alone
in
so
horrid
a
place
as
an
inn
;
but
the
other
stopt
*NL*
her
short
,
being
as
well
inclined
to
a
nap
as
herself
,
and
desired
the
*NL*
honour
of
being
her
bedfellow
.
Sophia
's
maid
agreed
to
give
her
a
*NL*
share
of
her
bed
,
but
put
in
her
claim
to
all
the
honour
.
So
,
after
*NL*
many
courtsies
and
compliments
,
to
bed
together
went
the
*NL*
waiting-women
,
as
their
mistresses
had
done
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
usual
with
my
landlord
-LRB-
as
indeed
it
is
with
the
whole
*NL*
fraternity
-RRB-
to
enquire
particularly
of
all
coachmen
,
footmen
,
*NL*
postboys
,
and
others
,
into
the
names
of
all
his
guests
;
what
their
*NL*
estate
was
,
and
where
it
lay
.
It
can
not
therefore
be
wondered
at
that
*NL*
the
many
particular
circumstances
which
attended
our
travellers
,
and
*NL*
especially
their
retiring
all
to
sleep
at
so
extraordinary
and
unusual
*NL*
an
hour
as
ten
in
the
morning
,
should
excite
his
curiosity
.
As
soon
,
*NL*
therefore
,
as
the
guides
entered
the
kitchen
,
he
began
to
examine
who
*NL*
the
ladies
were
,
and
whence
they
came
;
but
the
guides
,
though
they
*NL*
faithfully
related
all
they
knew
,
gave
him
very
little
satisfaction
.
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
they
rather
enflamed
his
curiosity
than
extinguished
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
landlord
had
the
character
,
among
all
his
neighbours
,
of
being
a
*NL*
very
sagacious
fellow
.
He
was
thought
to
see
farther
and
deeper
into
*NL*
things
than
any
man
in
the
parish
,
the
parson
himself
not
excepted
.
*NL*
Perhaps
his
look
had
contributed
not
a
little
to
procure
him
this
*NL*
reputation
;
for
there
was
in
this
something
wonderfully
wise
and
*NL*
significant
,
especially
when
he
had
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
;
which
,
*NL*
indeed
,
he
seldom
was
without
.
His
behaviour
,
likewise
,
greatly
*NL*
assisted
in
promoting
the
opinion
of
his
wisdom
.
In
his
deportment
he
*NL*
was
solemn
,
if
not
sullen
;
and
when
he
spoke
,
which
was
seldom
,
he
*NL*
always
delivered
himself
in
a
slow
voice
;
and
,
though
his
sentences
*NL*
were
short
,
they
were
still
interrupted
with
many
hums
and
ha
's
,
ay
*NL*
ays
,
and
other
expletives
:
so
that
,
though
he
accompanied
his
words
*NL*
with
certain
explanatory
gestures
,
such
as
shaking
or
nodding
the
*NL*
head
,
or
pointing
with
his
fore-finger
,
he
generally
left
his
hearers
*NL*
to
understand
more
than
he
expressed
;
nay
,
he
commonly
gave
them
a
*NL*
hint
that
he
knew
much
more
than
he
thought
proper
to
disclose
.
This
*NL*
last
circumstance
alone
may
,
indeed
,
very
well
account
for
his
*NL*
character
of
wisdom
;
since
men
are
strangely
inclined
to
worship
what
*NL*
they
do
not
understand
.
A
grand
secret
,
upon
which
several
imposers
on
*NL*
mankind
have
totally
relied
for
the
success
of
their
frauds
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
polite
person
,
now
taking
his
wife
aside
,
asked
her
``
what
she
*NL*
thought
of
the
ladies
lately
arrived
?
''
``
Think
of
them
?
''
said
the
wife
,
*NL*
``
why
,
what
should
I
think
of
them
?
''
``
I
know
,
''
answered
he
,
``
what
I
*NL*
think
.
The
guides
tell
strange
stories
.
One
pretends
to
be
come
from
*NL*
Gloucester
,
and
the
other
from
Upton
;
and
neither
of
them
,
for
what
I
*NL*
can
find
,
can
tell
whither
they
are
going
.
But
what
people
ever
travel
*NL*
across
the
country
from
Upton
hither
,
especially
to
London
?
And
one
of
*NL*
the
maid-servants
,
before
she
alighted
from
her
horse
,
asked
if
this
*NL*
was
not
the
London
road
?
Now
I
have
put
all
these
circumstances
*NL*
together
,
and
whom
do
you
think
I
have
found
them
out
to
be
?
''
``
Nay
,
''
*NL*
answered
she
,
``
you
know
I
never
pretend
to
guess
at
your
*NL*
discoveries
.
''
--
``
It
is
a
good
girl
,
''
replied
he
,
chucking
her
under
*NL*
the
chin
;
``
I
must
own
you
have
always
submitted
to
my
knowledge
of
*NL*
these
matters
.
Why
,
then
,
depend
upon
it
;
mind
what
I
say
--
depend
upon
*NL*
it
,
they
are
certainly
some
of
the
rebel
ladies
,
who
,
they
say
,
travel
*NL*
with
the
young
Chevalier
;
and
have
taken
a
roundabout
way
to
escape
*NL*
the
duke
's
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Husband
,
''
quoth
the
wife
,
``
you
have
certainly
hit
it
;
for
one
of
them
*NL*
is
dressed
as
fine
as
any
princess
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
she
looks
for
all
*NL*
the
world
like
one
.
--
But
yet
,
when
I
consider
one
thing
''
--
``
When
*NL*
you
consider
,
''
cries
the
landlord
contemptuously
--
``
Come
,
pray
let
's
*NL*
hear
what
you
consider
.
''
--
``
Why
,
it
is
,
''
answered
the
wife
,
``
that
she
*NL*
is
too
humble
to
be
any
very
great
lady
:
for
,
while
our
Betty
was
*NL*
warming
the
bed
,
she
called
her
nothing
but
child
,
and
my
dear
,
and
*NL*
sweetheart
;
and
,
when
Betty
offered
to
pull
off
her
shoes
and
*NL*
stockings
,
she
would
not
suffer
her
,
saying
,
she
would
not
give
her
*NL*
the
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pugh
!
''
answered
the
husband
,
``
that
is
nothing
.
Dost
think
,
because
*NL*
you
have
seen
some
great
ladies
rude
and
uncivil
to
persons
below
*NL*
them
,
that
none
of
them
know
how
to
behave
themselves
when
they
come
*NL*
before
their
inferiors
?
I
think
I
know
people
of
fashion
when
I
see
*NL*
them
--
I
think
I
do
.
Did
not
she
call
for
a
glass
of
water
when
she
*NL*
came
in
?
Another
sort
of
women
would
have
called
for
a
dram
;
you
know
*NL*
they
would
.
If
she
be
not
a
woman
of
very
great
quality
,
sell
me
for
a
*NL*
fool
;
and
,
I
believe
,
those
who
buy
me
will
have
a
bad
bargain
.
Now
,
*NL*
would
a
woman
of
her
quality
travel
without
a
footman
,
unless
upon
*NL*
some
such
extraordinary
occasion
?
''
``
Nay
,
to
be
sure
,
husband
,
''
cries
*NL*
she
,
``
you
know
these
matters
better
than
I
,
or
most
folk
.
''
``
I
think
I
*NL*
do
know
something
,
''
said
he
.
``
To
be
sure
,
''
answered
the
wife
,
``
the
*NL*
poor
little
heart
looked
so
piteous
,
when
she
sat
down
in
the
chair
,
I
*NL*
protest
I
could
not
help
having
a
compassion
for
her
almost
as
much
as
*NL*
if
she
had
been
a
poor
body
.
But
what
's
to
be
done
,
husband
?
If
an
she
*NL*
be
a
rebel
,
I
suppose
you
intend
to
betray
her
up
to
the
court
.
Well
,
*NL*
she
's
a
sweet-tempered
,
good-humoured
lady
,
be
she
what
she
will
,
and
*NL*
I
shall
hardly
refrain
from
crying
when
I
hear
she
is
hanged
or
*NL*
beheaded
.
''
``
Pooh
!
''
answered
the
husband
.
--
``
But
,
as
to
what
's
to
be
*NL*
done
,
it
is
not
so
easy
a
matter
to
determine
.
I
hope
,
before
she
goes
*NL*
away
,
we
shall
have
the
news
of
a
battle
;
for
,
if
the
Chevalier
should
*NL*
get
the
better
,
she
may
gain
us
interest
at
court
,
and
make
our
*NL*
fortunes
without
betraying
her
.
''
``
Why
,
that
's
true
,
''
replied
the
wife
;
*NL*
``
and
I
heartily
hope
she
will
have
it
in
her
power
.
Certainly
she
's
a
*NL*
sweet
good
lady
;
it
would
go
horribly
against
me
to
have
her
come
to
*NL*
any
harm
.
''
``
Pooh
!
''
cries
the
landlord
,
``
women
are
always
so
*NL*
tender-hearted
.
Why
,
you
would
not
harbour
rebels
,
would
you
?
''
``
No
,
*NL*
certainly
,
''
answered
the
wife
;
``
and
as
for
betraying
her
,
come
what
*NL*
will
o
n't
,
nobody
can
blame
us
.
It
is
what
anybody
would
do
in
our
*NL*
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
our
politic
landlord
,
who
had
not
,
we
see
,
undeservedly
the
*NL*
reputation
of
great
wisdom
among
his
neighbours
,
was
engaged
in
*NL*
debating
this
matter
with
himself
-LRB-
for
he
paid
little
attention
to
the
*NL*
opinion
of
his
wife
-RRB-
,
news
arrived
that
the
rebels
had
given
the
duke
*NL*
the
slip
,
and
had
got
a
day
's
march
towards
London
;
and
soon
after
*NL*
arrived
a
famous
Jacobite
squire
,
who
,
with
great
joy
in
his
*NL*
countenance
,
shook
the
landlord
by
the
hand
,
saying
,
``
All
's
our
own
,
*NL*
boy
,
ten
thousand
honest
Frenchmen
are
landed
in
Suffolk
.
Old
England
*NL*
for
ever
!
ten
thousand
French
,
my
brave
lad
!
I
am
going
to
tap
away
*NL*
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
news
determined
the
opinion
of
the
wise
man
,
and
he
resolved
to
*NL*
make
his
court
to
the
young
lady
when
she
arose
;
for
he
had
now
-LRB-
he
*NL*
said
-RRB-
discovered
that
she
was
no
other
than
Madam
Jenny
Cameron
*NL*
herself

Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
short
chapter
,
in
which
however
is
a
sun
,
a
moon
,
a
star
,
and
*NL*
an
angel
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
-LRB-
for
he
keeps
very
good
hours
at
this
time
of
the
year
-RRB-
had
*NL*
been
some
time
retired
to
rest
when
Sophia
arose
greatly
refreshed
by
*NL*
her
sleep
;
which
,
short
as
it
was
,
nothing
but
her
extreme
fatigue
*NL*
could
have
occasioned
;
for
,
though
she
had
told
her
maid
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
herself
too
,
that
she
was
perfectly
easy
when
she
left
Upton
,
yet
it
*NL*
is
certain
her
mind
was
a
little
affected
with
that
malady
which
is
*NL*
attended
with
all
the
restless
symptoms
of
a
fever
,
and
is
perhaps
the
*NL*
very
distemper
which
physicians
mean
-LRB-
if
they
mean
anything
-RRB-
by
the
*NL*
fever
on
the
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
likewise
left
her
bed
at
the
same
time
;
and
,
having
*NL*
summoned
her
maid
,
immediately
dressed
herself
.
She
was
really
a
very
*NL*
pretty
woman
,
and
,
had
she
been
in
any
other
company
but
that
of
*NL*
Sophia
,
might
have
been
thought
beautiful
;
but
when
Mrs
Honour
of
her
*NL*
own
accord
attended
-LRB-
for
her
mistress
would
not
suffer
her
to
be
*NL*
waked
-RRB-
,
and
had
equipped
our
heroine
,
the
charms
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
*NL*
who
had
performed
the
office
of
the
morning-star
,
and
had
preceded
*NL*
greater
glories
,
shared
the
fate
of
that
star
,
and
were
totally
*NL*
eclipsed
the
moment
those
glories
shone
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
Sophia
never
looked
more
beautiful
than
she
did
at
this
*NL*
instant
.
We
ought
not
,
therefore
,
to
condemn
the
maid
of
the
inn
for
*NL*
her
hyperbole
,
who
,
when
she
descended
,
after
having
lighted
the
fire
,
*NL*
declared
,
and
ratified
it
with
an
oath
,
that
if
ever
there
was
an
*NL*
angel
upon
earth
,
she
was
now
above-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
had
acquainted
her
cousin
with
her
design
to
go
to
London
;
and
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
had
agreed
to
accompany
her
;
for
the
arrival
of
her
*NL*
husband
at
Upton
had
put
an
end
to
her
design
of
going
to
Bath
,
or
to
*NL*
her
aunt
Western
.
They
had
therefore
no
sooner
finished
their
tea
than
*NL*
Sophia
proposed
to
set
out
,
the
moon
then
shining
extremely
bright
,
*NL*
and
as
for
the
frost
she
defied
it
;
nor
had
she
any
of
those
*NL*
apprehensions
which
many
young
ladies
would
have
felt
at
travelling
by
*NL*
night
;
for
she
had
,
as
we
have
before
observed
,
some
little
degree
of
*NL*
natural
courage
;
and
this
,
her
present
sensations
,
which
bordered
*NL*
somewhat
on
despair
,
greatly
encreased
.
Besides
,
as
she
had
already
*NL*
travelled
twice
with
safety
by
the
light
of
the
moon
,
she
was
the
*NL*
better
emboldened
to
trust
to
it
a
third
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
disposition
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
was
more
timorous
;
for
,
though
the
*NL*
greater
terrors
had
conquered
the
less
,
and
the
presence
of
her
*NL*
husband
had
driven
her
away
at
so
unseasonable
an
hour
from
Upton
,
*NL*
yet
,
being
now
arrived
at
a
place
where
she
thought
herself
safe
from
*NL*
his
pursuit
,
these
lesser
terrors
of
I
know
not
what
operated
so
*NL*
strongly
,
that
she
earnestly
entreated
her
cousin
to
stay
till
the
*NL*
next
morning
,
and
not
expose
herself
to
the
dangers
of
travelling
by
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
who
was
yielding
to
an
excess
,
when
she
could
neither
laugh
*NL*
nor
reason
her
cousin
out
of
these
apprehensions
,
at
last
gave
way
to
*NL*
them
.
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
had
she
known
of
her
father
's
arrival
at
Upton
,
*NL*
it
might
have
been
more
difficult
to
have
persuaded
her
;
for
as
to
*NL*
Jones
,
she
had
,
I
am
afraid
,
no
great
horror
at
the
thoughts
of
being
*NL*
overtaken
by
him
;
nay
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
I
believe
she
rather
*NL*
wished
than
feared
it
;
though
I
might
honestly
enough
have
concealed
*NL*
this
wish
from
the
reader
,
as
it
was
one
of
those
secret
spontaneous
*NL*
emotions
of
the
soul
to
which
the
reason
is
often
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
our
young
ladies
had
determined
to
remain
all
that
evening
in
*NL*
their
inn
they
were
attended
by
the
landlady
,
who
desired
to
know
what
*NL*
their
ladyships
would
be
pleased
to
eat
.
Such
charms
were
there
in
the
*NL*
voice
,
in
the
manner
,
and
in
the
affable
deportment
of
Sophia
,
that
*NL*
she
ravished
the
landlady
to
the
highest
degree
;
and
that
good
woman
,
*NL*
concluding
that
she
had
attended
Jenny
Cameron
,
became
in
a
moment
a
*NL*
stanch
Jacobite
,
and
wished
heartily
well
to
the
young
Pretender
's
*NL*
cause
,
from
the
great
sweetness
and
affability
with
which
she
had
been
*NL*
treated
by
his
supposed
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
cousins
began
now
to
impart
to
each
other
their
reciprocal
*NL*
curiosity
to
know

extraordinary
accidents
on
both
sides

occasioned
this
so
strange
and
unexpected
meeting

At

Mrs

Fitzpatrick

having
obtained
of
Sophia
a
promise
of
communicating
*NL*
likewise
in
her
turn

began
to
relate

*NL*
The
history
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
after
a
silence
of
a
few
moments
,
fetching
a
deep
*NL*
sigh
,
thus
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
natural
to
the
unhappy
to
feel
a
secret
concern
in
recollecting
*NL*
those
periods
of
their
lives
which
have
been
most
delightful
to
them
.
*NL*
The
remembrance
of
past
pleasures
affects
us
with
a
kind
of
tender
*NL*
grief
,
like
what
we
suffer
for
departed
friends
;
and
the
ideas
of
both
*NL*
may
be
said
to
haunt
our
imaginations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
this
reason
,
I
never
reflect
without
sorrow
on
those
days
-LRB-
the
*NL*
happiest
far
of
my
life
-RRB-
which
we
spent
together
when
both
were
under
*NL*
the
care
of
my
aunt
Western
.
Alas
!
why
are
Miss
Graveairs
and
Miss
*NL*
Giddy
no
more
?
You
remember
,
I
am
sure
,
when
we
knew
each
other
by
no
*NL*
other
names
.
Indeed
,
you
gave
the
latter
appellation
with
too
much
*NL*
cause
.
I
have
since
experienced
how
much
I
deserved
it
.
You
,
my
*NL*
Sophia
,
was
always
my
superior
in
everything
,
and
I
heartily
hope
you
*NL*
will
be
so
in
your
fortune
.
I
shall
never
forget
the
wise
and
matronly
*NL*
advice
you
once
gave
me
,
when
I
lamented
being
disappointed
of
a
ball
,
*NL*
though
you
could
not
be
then
fourteen
years
old
.
--
O
my
Sophy
,
how
*NL*
blest
must
have
been
my
situation
,
when
I
could
think
such
a
*NL*
disappointment
a
misfortune
;
and
when
indeed
it
was
the
greatest
I
had
*NL*
ever
known
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
my
dear
Harriet
,
''
answered
Sophia
,
``
it
was
then
a
serious
*NL*
matter
with
you
.
Comfort
yourself
therefore
with
thinking
,
that
*NL*
whatever
you
now
lament
may
hereafter
appear
as
trifling
and
*NL*
contemptible
as
a
ball
would
at
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
my
Sophia
,
''
replied
the
other
lady
,
``
you
yourself
will
think
*NL*
otherwise
of
my
present
situation
;
for
greatly
must
that
tender
heart
*NL*
be
altered
if
my
misfortunes
do
not
draw
many
a
sigh
,
nay
,
many
a
*NL*
tear
,
from
you
.
The
knowledge
of
this
should
perhaps
deter
me
from
*NL*
relating
what
I
am
convinced
will
so
much
affect
you
.
''
Here
Mrs
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
stopt
,
till
,
at
the
repeated
entreaties
of
Sophia
,
she
*NL*
thus
proceeded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
you
must
have
heard
much
of
my
marriage
;
yet
,
as
matters
may
*NL*
probably
have
been
misrepresented
,
I
will
set
out
from
the
very
*NL*
commencement
of
my
unfortunate
acquaintance
with
my
present
husband
;
*NL*
which
was
at
Bath
,
soon
after
you
left
my
aunt
,
and
returned
home
to
*NL*
your
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Among
the
gay
young
fellows
who
were
at
this
season
at
Bath
,
Mr
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
was
one
.
He
was
handsome
,
_
degage
,
_
extremely
gallant
,
and
*NL*
in
his
dress
exceeded
most
others
.
In
short
,
my
dear
,
if
you
was
*NL*
unluckily
to
see
him
now
,
I
could
describe
him
no
better
than
by
*NL*
telling
you
he
was
the
very
reverse
of
everything
which
he
is
:
for
he
*NL*
hath
rusticated
himself
so
long
,
that
he
is
become
an
absolute
wild
*NL*
Irishman
.
But
to
proceed
in
my
story
:
the
qualifications
which
he
then
*NL*
possessed
so
well
recommended
him
,
that
,
though
the
people
of
quality
*NL*
at
that
time
lived
separate
from
the
rest
of
the
company
,
and
excluded
*NL*
them
from
all
their
parties
,
Mr
Fitzpatrick
found
means
to
gain
*NL*
admittance
.
It
was
perhaps
no
easy
matter
to
avoid
him
;
for
he
*NL*
required
very
little
or
no
invitation
;
and
as
,
being
handsome
and
*NL*
genteel
,
he
found
it
no
very
difficult
matter
to
ingratiate
himself
*NL*
with
the
ladies
,
so
,
he
having
frequently
drawn
his
sword
,
the
men
did
*NL*
not
care
publickly
to
affront
him
.
Had
it
not
been
for
some
such
*NL*
reason
,
I
believe
he
would
have
been
soon
expelled
by
his
own
sex
;
for
*NL*
surely
he
had
no
strict
title
to
be
preferred
to
the
English
gentry
;
*NL*
nor
did
they
seem
inclined
to
show
him
any
extraordinary
favour
.
They
*NL*
all
abused
him
behind
his
back
,
which
might
probably
proceed
from
*NL*
envy
;
for
by
the
women
he
was
well
received
,
and
very
particularly
*NL*
distinguished
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
aunt
,
though
no
person
of
quality
herself
,
as
she
had
always
lived
*NL*
about
the
court
,
was
enrolled
in
that
party
;
for
,
by
whatever
means
*NL*
you
get
into
the
polite
circle
,
when
you
are
once
there
,
it
is
*NL*
sufficient
merit
for
you
that
you
are
there
.
This
observation
,
young
*NL*
as
you
was
,
you
could
scarce
avoid
making
from
my
aunt
,
who
was
free
,
*NL*
or
reserved
,
with
all
people
,
just
as
they
had
more
or
less
of
this
*NL*
merit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
merit
,
I
believe
,
it
was
,
which
principally
recommended
Mr
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
to
her
favour
.
In
which
he
so
well
succeeded
,
that
he
was
*NL*
always
one
of
her
private
parties
.
Nor
was
he
backward
in
returning
*NL*
such
distinction
;
for
he
soon
grew
so
very
particular
in
his
behaviour
*NL*
to
her
,
that
the
scandal
club
first
began
to
take
notice
of
it
,
and
*NL*
the
better-disposed
persons
made
a
match
between
them
.
For
my
own
*NL*
part
,
I
confess
,
I
made
no
doubt
but
that
his
designs
were
strictly
*NL*
honourable
,
as
the
phrase
is
;
that
is
,
to
rob
a
lady
of
her
fortune
by
*NL*
way
of
marriage
.
My
aunt
was
,
I
conceived
,
neither
young
enough
nor
*NL*
handsome
enough
to
attract
much
wicked
inclination
;
but
she
had
*NL*
matrimonial
charms
in
great
abundance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
the
more
confirmed
in
this
opinion
from
the
extraordinary
*NL*
respect
which
he
showed
to
myself
from
the
first
moment
of
our
*NL*
acquaintance
.
This
I
understood
as
an
attempt
to
lessen
,
if
possible
,
*NL*
that
disinclination
which
my
interest
might
be
supposed
to
give
me
*NL*
towards
the
match
;
and
I
know
not
but
in
some
measure
it
had
that
*NL*
effect
;
for
,
as
I
was
well
contented
with
my
own
fortune
,
and
of
all
*NL*
people
the
least
a
slave
to
interested
views
,
so
I
could
not
be
*NL*
violently
the
enemy
of
a
man
with
whose
behaviour
to
me
I
was
greatly
*NL*
pleased
;
and
the
more
so
,
as
I
was
the
only
object
of
such
respect
;
*NL*
for
he
behaved
at
the
same
time
to
many
women
of
quality
without
any
*NL*
respect
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreeable
as
this
was
to
me
,
he
soon
changed
it
into
another
kind
of
*NL*
behaviour
,
which
was
perhaps
more
so
.
He
now
put
on
much
softness
and
*NL*
tenderness
,
and
languished
and
sighed
abundantly
.
At
times
,
indeed
,
*NL*
whether
from
art
or
nature
I
will
not
determine
,
he
gave
his
usual
*NL*
loose
to
gaiety
and
mirth
;
but
this
was
always
in
general
company
,
and
*NL*
with
other
women
;
for
even
in
a
country-dance
,
when
he
was
not
my
*NL*
partner
,
he
became
grave
,
and
put
on
the
softest
look
imaginable
the
*NL*
moment
he
approached
me
.
Indeed
he
was
in
all
things
so
very
*NL*
particular
towards
me
,
that
I
must
have
been
blind
not
to
have
*NL*
discovered
it
.
And
,
and
,
and
--
''
``
And
you
was
more
pleased
still
,
my
*NL*
dear
Harriet
,
''
cries
Sophia
;
``
you
need
not
be
ashamed
,
''
added
she
,
*NL*
sighing
;
``
for
sure
there
are
irresistible
charms
in
tenderness
,
which
*NL*
too
many
men
are
able
to
affect
.
''
``
True
,
''
answered
her
cousin
;
``
men
,
*NL*
who
in
all
other
instances
want
common
sense
,
are
very
Machiavels
in
*NL*
the
art
of
loving
.
I
wish
I
did
not
know
an
instance
.
--
Well
,
scandal
*NL*
now
began
to
be
as
busy
with
me
as
it
had
before
been
with
my
aunt
;
*NL*
and
some
good
ladies
did
not
scruple
to
affirm
that
Mr
Fitzpatrick
had
*NL*
an
intrigue
with
us
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
what
may
seem
astonishing
,
my
aunt
never
saw
,
nor
in
the
least
*NL*
seemed
to
suspect
,
that
which
was
visible
enough
,
I
believe
,
from
both
*NL*
our
behaviours
.
One
would
indeed
think
that
love
quite
puts
out
the
*NL*
eyes
of
an
old
woman
.
In
fact
,
they
so
greedily
swallow
the
addresses
*NL*
which
are
made
to
them
,
that
,
like
an
outrageous
glutton
,
they
are
not
*NL*
at
leisure
to
observe
what
passes
amongst
others
at
the
same
table
.
*NL*
This
I
have
observed
in
more
cases
than
my
own
;
and
this
was
so
*NL*
strongly
verified
by
my
aunt
,
that
,
though
she
often
found
us
together
*NL*
at
her
return
from
the
pump
,
the
least
canting
word
of
his
,
pretending
*NL*
impatience
at
her
absence
,
effectually
smothered
all
suspicion
.
One
*NL*
artifice
succeeded
with
her
to
admiration
.
This
was
his
treating
me
*NL*
like
a
little
child
,
and
never
calling
me
by
any
other
name
in
her
*NL*
presence
but
that
of
pretty
miss
.
This
indeed
did
him
some
disservice
*NL*
with
your
humble
servant
;
but
I
soon
saw
through
it
,
especially
as
in
*NL*
her
absence
he
behaved
to
me
,
as
I
have
said
,
in
a
different
manner
.
*NL*
However
,
if
I
was
not
greatly
disobliged
by
a
conduct
of
which
I
had
*NL*
discovered
the
design
,
I
smarted
very
severely
for
it
;
for
my
aunt
*NL*
really
conceived
me
to
be
what
her
lover
-LRB-
as
she
thought
him
-RRB-
called
*NL*
me
,
and
treated
me
in
all
respects
as
a
perfect
infant
.
To
say
the
*NL*
truth
,
I
wonder
she
had
not
insisted
on
my
again
wearing
*NL*
leading-strings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
last
,
my
lover
-LRB-
for
so
he
was
-RRB-
thought
proper
,
in
a
most
solemn
*NL*
manner
,
to
disclose
a
secret
which
I
had
known
long
before
.
He
now
*NL*
placed
all
the
love
which
he
had
pretended
to
my
aunt
to
my
account
.
*NL*
He
lamented
,
in
very
pathetic
terms
,
the
encouragement
she
had
given
*NL*
him
,
and
made
a
high
merit
of
the
tedious
hours
in
which
he
had
*NL*
undergone
her
conversation
.
--
What
shall
I
tell
you
,
my
dear
*NL*
Sophia
?
--
Then
I
will
confess
the
truth
.
I
was
pleased
with
my
man
.
I
*NL*
was
pleased
with
my
conquest
.
To
rival
my
aunt
delighted
me
;
to
rival
*NL*
so
many
other
women
charmed
me
.
In
short
,
I
am
afraid
I
did
not
behave
*NL*
as
I
should
do
,
even
upon
the
very
first
declaration
--
I
wish
I
did
not
*NL*
almost
give
him
positive
encouragement
before
we
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Bath
now
talked
loudly
--
I
might
almost
say
,
roared
against
me
.
*NL*
Several
young
women
affected
to
shun
my
acquaintance
,
not
so
much
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
from
any
real
suspicion
,
as
from
a
desire
of
banishing
me
*NL*
from
a
company
in
which
I
too
much
engrossed
their
favourite
man
.
And
*NL*
here
I
can
not
omit
expressing
my
gratitude
to
the
kindness
intended
me
*NL*
by
Mr
Nash
,
who
took
me
one
day
aside
,
and
gave
me
advice
,
which
if
I
*NL*
had
followed
,
I
had
been
a
happy
woman
.
`
Child
,
'
says
he
,
`
I
am
sorry
*NL*
to
see
the
familiarity
which
subsists
between
you
and
a
fellow
who
is
*NL*
altogether
unworthy
of
you
,
and
I
am
afraid
will
prove
your
ruin
.
As
*NL*
for
your
old
stinking
aunt
,
if
it
was
to
be
no
injury
to
you
and
my
*NL*
pretty
Sophy
Western
-LRB-
I
assure
you
I
repeat
his
words
-RRB-
,
I
should
be
*NL*
heartily
glad
that
the
fellow
was
in
possession
of
all
that
belongs
to
*NL*
her
.
I
never
advise
old
women
:
for
,
if
they
take
it
into
their
heads
*NL*
to
go
to
the
devil
,
it
is
no
more
possible
than
worth
while
to
keep
*NL*
them
from
him
.
Innocence
and
youth
and
beauty
are
worthy
a
better
*NL*
fate
,
and
I
would
save
them
from
his
clutches
.
Let
me
advise
you
*NL*
therefore
,
dear
child
,
never
suffer
this
fellow
to
be
particular
with
*NL*
you
again
.
'
Many
more
things
he
said
to
me
,
which
I
have
now
*NL*
forgotten
,
and
indeed
I
attended
very
little
to
them
at
the
time
;
for
*NL*
inclination
contradicted
all
he
said
;
and
,
besides
,
I
could
not
be
*NL*
persuaded
that
women
of
quality
would
condescend
to
familiarity
with
*NL*
such
a
person
as
he
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
afraid
,
my
dear
,
I
shall
tire
you
with
a
detail
of
so
many
*NL*
minute
circumstances
.
To
be
concise
,
therefore
,
imagine
me
married
;
*NL*
imagine
me
with
my
husband
,
at
the
feet
of
my
aunt
;
and
then
imagine
*NL*
the
maddest
woman
in
Bedlam
,
in
a
raving
fit
,
and
your
imagination
*NL*
will
suggest
to
you
no
more
than
what
really
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
next
day
my
aunt
left
the
place
,
partly
to
avoid
seeing
Mr
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
or
myself
,
and
as
much
perhaps
to
avoid
seeing
any
one
*NL*
else
;
for
,
though
I
am
told
she
hath
since
denied
everything
stoutly
,
*NL*
I
believe
she
was
then
a
little
confounded
at
her
disappointment
.
*NL*
Since
that
time
,
I
have
written
to
her
many
letters
,
but
never
could
*NL*
obtain
an
answer
,
which
I
must
own
sits
somewhat
the
heavier
,
as
she
*NL*
herself
was
,
though
undesignedly
,
the
occasion
of
all
my
sufferings
:
*NL*
for
,
had
it
not
been
under
the
colour
of
paying
his
addresses
to
her
,
*NL*
Mr
Fitzpatrick
would
never
have
found
sufficient
opportunities
to
have
*NL*
engaged
my
heart
,
which
,
in
other
circumstances
,
I
still
flatter
*NL*
myself
would
not
have
been
an
easy
conquest
to
such
a
person
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
I
believe
I
should
not
have
erred
so
grossly
in
my
choice
if
I
had
*NL*
relied
on
my
own
judgment
;
but
I
trusted
totally
to
the
opinion
of
*NL*
others
,
and
very
foolishly
took
the
merit
of
a
man
for
granted
whom
I
*NL*
saw
so
universally
well
received
by
the
women
.
What
is
the
reason
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
that
we
,
who
have
understandings
equal
to
the
wisest
and
*NL*
greatest
of
the
other
sex
,
so
often
make
choice
of
the
silliest
*NL*
fellows
for
companions
and
favourites
?
It
raises
my
indignation
to
the
*NL*
highest
pitch
to
reflect
on
the
numbers
of
women
of
sense
who
have
*NL*
been
undone
by
fools
.
''
Here
she
paused
a
moment
;
but
,
Sophia
making
no
*NL*
answer
,
she
proceeded
as

*NL*
Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
In
which
the
history
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
is
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
remained
at
Bath
no
longer
than
a
fortnight
after
our
wedding
;
for
*NL*
as
to
any
reconciliation
with
my
aunt
,
there
were
no
hopes
;
and
of
my
*NL*
fortune
not
one
farthing
could
be
touched
till
I
was
of
age
,
of
which
*NL*
I
now
wanted
more
than
two
years
.
My
husband
therefore
was
resolved
to
*NL*
set
out
for
Ireland
;
against
which
I
remonstrated
very
earnestly
,
and
*NL*
insisted
on
a
promise
which
he
had
made
me
before
our
marriage
that
I
*NL*
should
never
take
this
journey
against
my
consent
;
and
indeed
I
never
*NL*
intended
to
consent
to
it
;
nor
will
anybody
,
I
believe
,
blame
me
for
*NL*
that
resolution
;
but
this
,
however
,
I
never
mentioned
to
my
husband
,
*NL*
and
petitioned
only
for
the
reprieve
of
a
month
;
but
he
had
fixed
the
*NL*
day
,
and
to
that
day
he
obstinately
adhered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
evening
before
our
departure
,
as
we
were
disputing
this
point
*NL*
with
great
eagerness
on
both
sides
,
he
started
suddenly
from
his
*NL*
chair
,
and
left
me
abruptly
,
saying
he
was
going
to
the
rooms
.
He
was
*NL*
hardly
out
of
the
house
when
I
saw
a
paper
lying
on
the
floor
,
which
,
*NL*
I
suppose
,
he
had
carelessly
pulled
from
his
pocket
,
together
with
his
*NL*
handkerchief
.
This
paper
I
took
up
,
and
,
finding
it
to
be
a
letter
,
I
*NL*
made
no
scruple
to
open
and
read
it
;
and
indeed
I
read
it
so
often
*NL*
that
I
can
repeat
it
to
you
almost
word
for
word
.
This
then
was
the
*NL*
letter
:
*NL*
*NL*
_
`
To
Mr
Brian
Fitzpatrick
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
`
SIR
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
YOURS
received
,
and
am
surprized
you
should
use
me
in
this
manner
,
*NL*
as
have
never
seen
any
of
your
cash
,
unless
for
one
linsey-woolsey
*NL*
coat
,
and
your
bill
now
is
upwards
of
L150
.
Consider
,
sir
,
how
often
*NL*
you
have
fobbed
me
off
with
your
being
shortly
to
be
married
to
this
*NL*
lady
and
t
`
other
lady
;
but
I
can
neither
live
on
hopes
or
promises
,
*NL*
nor
will
my
woollen-draper
take
any
such
in
payment
.
You
tell
me
you
*NL*
are
secure
of
having
either
the
aunt
or
the
niece
,
and
that
you
*NL*
might
have
married
the
aunt
before
this
,
whose
jointure
you
say
is
*NL*
immense
,
but
that
you
prefer
the
niece
on
account
of
her
ready
*NL*
money
.
Pray
,
sir
,
take
a
fool
's
advice
for
once
,
and
marry
the
first
*NL*
you
can
get
.
You
will
pardon
my
offering
my
advice
,
as
you
know
I
*NL*
sincerely
wish
you
well
.
Shall
draw
on
you
per
next
post
,
in
favour
*NL*
of
Messieurs
John
Drugget
and
company
,
at
fourteen
days
,
which
doubt
*NL*
not
your
honouring
,
and
am
,
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
,
your
humble
servant
,
`
SAM
.
COSGRAVE
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
the
letter
,
word
for
word
.
Guess
,
my
dear
girl
--
guess
how
*NL*
this
letter
affected
me
.
You
prefer
the
niece
on
account
of
her
ready
*NL*
money
!
If
every
one
of
these
words
had
been
a
dagger
,
I
could
with
*NL*
pleasure
have
stabbed
them
into
his
heart
;
but
I
will
not
recount
my
*NL*
frantic
behaviour
on
the
occasion
.
I
had
pretty
well
spent
my
tears
*NL*
before
his
return
home
;
but
sufficient
remains
of
them
appeared
in
my
*NL*
swollen
eyes
.
He
threw
himself
sullenly
into
his
chair
,
and
for
a
long
*NL*
time
we
were
both
silent
.
At
length
,
in
a
haughty
tone
,
he
said
,
`
I
*NL*
hope
,
madam
,
your
servants
have
packed
up
all
your
things
;
for
the
*NL*
coach
will
be
ready
by
six
in
the
morning
.
'
My
patience
was
totally
*NL*
subdued
by
this
provocation
,
and
I
answered
,
`
No
,
sir
,
there
is
a
*NL*
letter
still
remains
unpacked
;
'
and
then
throwing
it
on
the
table
I
*NL*
fell
to
upbraiding
him
with
the
most
bitter
language
I
could
invent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whether
guilt
,
or
shame
,
or
prudence
,
restrained
him
I
can
not
say
;
*NL*
but
,
though
he
is
the
most
passionate
of
men
,
he
exerted
no
rage
on
*NL*
this
occasion
.
He
endeavoured
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
pacify
me
by
the
*NL*
most
gentle
means
.
He
swore
the
phrase
in
the
letter
to
which
I
*NL*
principally
objected
was
not
his
,
nor
had
he
ever
written
any
such
.
He
*NL*
owned
,
indeed
,
the
having
mentioned
his
marriage
,
and
that
preference
*NL*
which
he
had
given
to
myself
,
but
denied
with
many
oaths
the
having
*NL*
mentioned
any
such
matter
at
all
on
account
of
the
straits
he
was
in
*NL*
for
money
,
arising
,
he
said
,
from
his
having
too
long
neglected
his
*NL*
estate
in
Ireland
.
And
this
,
he
said
,
which
he
could
not
bear
to
*NL*
discover
to
me
,
was
the
only
reason
of
his
having
so
strenuously
*NL*
insisted
on
our
journey
.
He
then
used
several
very
endearing
*NL*
expressions
,
and
concluded
by
a
very
fond
caress
,
and
many
violent
*NL*
protestations
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
one
circumstance
which
,
though
he
did
not
appeal
to
it
,
had
*NL*
much
weight
with
me
in
his
favour
,
and
that
was
the
word
jointure
in
*NL*
the
taylor
's
letter
,
whereas
my
aunt
never
had
been
married
,
and
this
*NL*
Mr
Fitzpatrick
well
knew
.
--
As
I
imagined
,
therefore
,
that
the
fellow
*NL*
must
have
inserted
this
of
his
own
head
,
or
from
hearsay
,
I
persuaded
*NL*
myself
he
might
have
ventured
likewise
on
that
odious
line
on
no
*NL*
better
authority
.
What
reasoning
was
this
,
my
dear
?
was
I
not
an
*NL*
advocate
rather
than
a
judge
?
--
But
why
do
I
mention
such
a
*NL*
circumstance
as
this
,
or
appeal
to
it
for
the
justification
of
my
*NL*
forgiveness
?
--
In
short
,
had
he
been
guilty
of
twenty
times
as
much
,
*NL*
half
the
tenderness
and
fondness
which
he
used
would
have
prevailed
on
*NL*
me
to
have
forgiven
him
.
I
now
made
no
farther
objections
to
our
*NL*
setting
out
,
which
we
did
the
next
morning
,
and
in
a
little
more
than
*NL*
a
week
arrived
at
the
seat
of
Mr
Fitzpatrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
curiosity
will
excuse
me
from
relating
any
occurrences
which
*NL*
past
during
our
journey
;
for
it
would
indeed
be
highly
disagreeable
to
*NL*
travel
it
over
again
,
and
no
less
so
to
you
to
travel
it
over
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
seat
,
then
,
is
an
ancient
mansion-house
:
if
I
was
in
one
of
*NL*
those
merry
humours
in
which
you
have
so
often
seen
me
,
I
could
*NL*
describe
it
to
you
ridiculously
enough
.
It
looked
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
formerly
inhabited
by
a
gentleman
.
Here
was
room
enough
,
and
not
the
*NL*
less
room
on
account
of
the
furniture
;
for
indeed
there
was
very
*NL*
little
in
it
.
An
old
woman
,
who
seemed
coeval
with
the
building
,
and
*NL*
greatly
resembled
her
whom
Chamont
mentions
in
the
Orphan
,
received
us
*NL*
at
the
gate
,
and
in
a
howl
scarce
human
,
and
to
me
unintelligible
,
*NL*
welcomed
her
master
home
.
In
short
,
the
whole
scene
was
so
gloomy
and
*NL*
melancholy
,
that
it
threw
my
spirits
into
the
lowest
dejection
;
which
*NL*
my
husband
discerning
,
instead
of
relieving
,
encreased
by
two
or
three
*NL*
malicious
observations
.
`
There
are
good
houses
,
madam
,
'
says
he
,
`
as
*NL*
you
find
,
in
other
places
besides
England
;
but
perhaps
you
had
rather
*NL*
be
in
a
dirty
lodgings
at
Bath
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
,
my
dear
,
is
the
woman
who
,
in
any
state
of
life
,
hath
a
*NL*
cheerful
good-natured
companion
to
support
and
comfort
her
!
But
why
do
*NL*
I
reflect
on
happy
situations
only
to
aggravate
my
own
misery
?
my
*NL*
companion
,
far
from
clearing
up
the
gloom
of
solitude
,
soon
convinced
*NL*
me
that
I
must
have
been
wretched
with
him
in
any
place
,
and
in
any
*NL*
condition
.
In
a
word
,
he
was
a
surly
fellow
,
a
character
perhaps
you
*NL*
have
never
seen
;
for
,
indeed
,
no
woman
ever
sees
it
exemplified
but
in
*NL*
a
father
,
a
brother
,
or
a
husband
;
and
,
though
you
have
a
father
,
he
*NL*
is
not
of
that
character
.
This
surly
fellow
had
formerly
appeared
to
*NL*
me
the
very
reverse
,
and
so
he
did
still
to
every
other
person
.
Good
*NL*
heaven
!
how
is
it
possible
for
a
man
to
maintain
a
constant
lie
in
his
*NL*
appearance
abroad
and
in
company
,
and
to
content
himself
with
shewing
*NL*
disagreeable
truth
only
at
home
?
Here
,
my
dear
,
they
make
themselves
*NL*
amends
for
the
uneasy
restraint
which
they
put
on
their
tempers
in
the
*NL*
world
;
for
I
have
observed
,
the
more
merry
and
gay
and
good-humoured
*NL*
my
husband
hath
at
any
time
been
in
company
,
the
more
sullen
and
*NL*
morose
he
was
sure
to
become
at
our
next
private
meeting
.
How
shall
I
*NL*
describe
his
barbarity
?
To
my
fondness
he
was
cold
and
insensible
.
My
*NL*
little
comical
ways
,
which
you
,
my
Sophy
,
and
which
others
,
have
*NL*
called
so
agreeable
,
he
treated
with
contempt
.
In
my
most
serious
*NL*
moments
he
sung
and
whistled
;
and
whenever
I
was
thoroughly
dejected
*NL*
and
miserable
he
was
angry
,
and
abused
me
:
for
,
though
he
was
never
*NL*
pleased
with
my
good-humour
,
nor
ascribed
it
to
my
satisfaction
in
*NL*
him
,
yet
my
low
spirits
always
offended
him
,
and
those
he
imputed
to
*NL*
my
repentance
of
having
-LRB-
as
he
said
-RRB-
married
an
Irishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
easily
conceive
,
my
dear
Graveairs
-LRB-
I
ask
your
pardon
,
I
*NL*
really
forgot
myself
-RRB-
,
that
,
when
a
woman
makes
an
imprudent
match
in
*NL*
the
sense
of
the
world
,
that
is
,
when
she
is
not
an
arrant
prostitute
*NL*
to
pecuniary
interest
,
she
must
necessarily
have
some
inclination
and
*NL*
affection
for
her
man
.
You
will
as
easily
believe
that
this
affection
*NL*
may
possibly
be
lessened
;
nay
,
I
do
assure
you
,
contempt
will
wholly
*NL*
eradicate
it
.
This
contempt
I
now
began
to
entertain
for
my
husband
,
*NL*
whom
I
now
discovered
to
be
--
I
must
use
the
expression
--
an
arrant
*NL*
blockhead
.
Perhaps
you
will
wonder
I
did
not
make
this
discovery
long
*NL*
before
;
but
women
will
suggest
a
thousand
excuses
to
themselves
for
*NL*
the
folly
of
those
they
like
:
besides
,
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
it
*NL*
requires
a
most
penetrating
eye
to
discern
a
fool
through
the
*NL*
disguises
of
gaiety
and
good
breeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
easily
imagined
that
,
when
I
once
despised
my
husband
,
as
*NL*
I
confess
to
you
I
soon
did
,
I
must
consequently
dislike
his
company
;
*NL*
and
indeed
I
had
the
happiness
of
being
very
little
troubled
with
it
;
*NL*
for
our
house
was
now
most
elegantly
furnished
,
our
cellars
well
*NL*
stocked
,
and
dogs
and
horses
provided
in
great
abundance
.
As
my
*NL*
gentleman
therefore
entertained
his
neighbours
with
great
hospitality
,
*NL*
so
his
neighbours
resorted
to
him
with
great
alacrity
;
and
sports
and
*NL*
drinking
consumed
so
much
of
his
time
,
that
a
small
part
of
his
*NL*
conversation
,
that
is
to
say
,
of
his
ill-humours
,
fell
to
my
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
would
it
have
been
for
me
if
I
could
as
easily
have
avoided
all
*NL*
other
disagreeable
company
;
but
,
alas
!
I
was
confined
to
some
which
*NL*
constantly
tormented
me
;
and
the
more
,
as
I
saw
no
prospect
of
being
*NL*
relieved
from
them
.
These
companions
were
my
own
racking
thoughts
,
*NL*
which
plagued
and
in
a
manner
haunted
me
night
and
day
.
In
this
*NL*
situation
I
past
through
a
scene
,
the
horrors
of
which
can
neither
be
*NL*
painted
nor
imagined
.
Think
,
my
dear
,
figure
,
if
you
can
,
to
yourself
,
*NL*
what
I
must
have
undergone
.
I
became
a
mother
by
the
man
I
scorned
,
*NL*
hated
,
and
detested
.
I
went
through
all
the
agonies
and
miseries
of
a
*NL*
lying-in
-LRB-
ten
times
more
painful
in
such
a
circumstance
than
the
worst
*NL*
labour
can
be
when
one
endures
it
for
a
man
one
loves
-RRB-
in
a
desert

without

without
any
of
those
agreeable
circumstances

often

In
which
the
mistake
of
the
landlord
throws
Sophia
into
a
dreadful
*NL*
consternation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
was
proceeding
in
her
narrative
when
she
was
*NL*
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
dinner
,
greatly
to
the
concern
of
*NL*
Sophia
;
for
the
misfortunes
of
her
friend
had
raised
her
anxiety
,
and
*NL*
left
her
no
appetite
but
what
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
was
to
satisfy
by
her
*NL*
relation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
now
attended
with
a
plate
under
his
arm
,
and
with
the
*NL*
same
respect
in
his
countenance
and
address
which
he
would
have
put
on
*NL*
had
the
ladies
arrived
in
a
coach
and
six
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
married
lady
seemed
less
affected
with
her
own
misfortunes
than
*NL*
was
her
cousin
;
for
the
former
eat
very
heartily
,
whereas
the
latter
*NL*
could
hardly
swallow
a
morsel
.
Sophia
likewise
showed
more
concern
and
*NL*
sorrow
in
her
countenance
than
appeared
in
the
other
lady
;
who
,
having
*NL*
observed
these
symptoms
in
her
friend
,
begged
her
to
be
comforted
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
Perhaps
all
may
yet
end
better
than
either
you
or
I
expect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
landlord
thought
he
had
now
an
opportunity
to
open
his
mouth
,
and
*NL*
was
resolved
not
to
omit
it
.
``
I
am
sorry
,
madam
,
''
cries
he
,
``
that
your
*NL*
ladyship
ca
n't
eat
;
for
to
be
sure
you
must
be
hungry
after
so
long
*NL*
fasting
.
I
hope
your
ladyship
is
not
uneasy
at
anything
,
for
,
as
madam
*NL*
there
says
,
all
may
end
better
than
anybody
expects
.
A
gentleman
who
*NL*
was
here
just
now
brought
excellent
news
;
and
perhaps
some
folks
who
*NL*
have
given
other
folks
the
slip
may
get
to
London
before
they
are
*NL*
overtaken
;
and
if
they
do
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
they
will
find
people
*NL*
who
will
be
very
ready
to
receive
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
persons
under
the
apprehension
of
danger
convert
whatever
they
see
*NL*
and
hear
into
the
objects
of
that
apprehension
.
Sophia
therefore
*NL*
immediately
concluded
,
from
the
foregoing
speech
,
that
she
was
known
,
*NL*
and
pursued
by
her
father
.
She
was
now
struck
with
the
utmost
*NL*
consternation
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
deprived
of
the
power
of
speech
;
*NL*
which
she
no
sooner
recovered
than
she
desired
the
landlord
to
send
*NL*
his
servants
out
of
the
room
,
and
then
,
addressing
herself
to
him
,
*NL*
said
,
``
I
perceive
,
sir
,
you
know
who
we
are
;
but
I
beseech
you
--
nay
,
I
*NL*
am
convinced
,
if
you
have
any
compassion
or
goodness
,
you
will
not
*NL*
betray
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
betray
your
ladyship
!
''
quoth
the
landlord
;
``
no
-LRB-
and
then
he
swore
*NL*
several
very
hearty
oaths
-RRB-
;
I
would
sooner
be
cut
into
ten
thousand
*NL*
pieces
.
I
hate
all
treachery
.
I
!
I
never
betrayed
any
one
in
my
life
*NL*
yet
,
and
I
am
sure
I
shall
not
begin
with
so
sweet
a
lady
as
your
*NL*
ladyship
.
All
the
world
would
very
much
blame
me
if
I
should
,
since
it
*NL*
will
be
in
your
ladyship
's
power
so
shortly
to
reward
me
.
My
wife
can
*NL*
witness
for
me
,
I
knew
your
ladyship
the
moment
you
came
into
the
*NL*
house
:
I
said
it
was
your
honour
,
before
I
lifted
you
from
your
horse
,
*NL*
and
I
shall
carry
the
bruises
I
got
in
your
ladyship
's
service
to
the
*NL*
grave
;
but
what
signified
that
,
as
long
as
I
saved
your
ladyship
?
To
*NL*
be
sure
some
people
this
morning
would
have
thought
of
getting
a
*NL*
reward
;
but
no
such
thought
ever
entered
into
my
head
.
I
would
sooner
*NL*
starve
than
take
any
reward
for
betraying
your
ladyship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
you
,
sir
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
if
it
be
ever
in
my
power
to
*NL*
reward
you
,
you
shall
not
lose
by
your
generosity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alack-a-day
,
madam
!
''
answered
the
landlord
;
``
in
your
ladyship
's
*NL*
power
!
Heaven
put
it
as
much
into
your
will
!
I
am
only
afraid
your
*NL*
honour
will
forget
such
a
poor
man
as
an
innkeeper
;
but
,
if
your
*NL*
ladyship
should
not
,
I
hope
you
will
remember
what
reward
I
*NL*
refused
--
refused
!
that
is
,
I
would
have
refused
,
and
to
be
sure
it
may
*NL*
be
called
refusing
,
for
I
might
have
had
it
certainly
;
and
to
be
sure
*NL*
you
might
have
been
in
some
houses
;
--
but
,
for
my
part
,
would
not
*NL*
methinks
for
the
world
have
your
ladyship
wrong
me
so
much
as
to
*NL*
imagine
I
ever
thought
of
betraying
you
,
even
before
I
heard
the
good
*NL*
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
news
,
pray
?
''
says
Sophia
,
something
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hath
not
your
ladyship
heard
it
,
then
?
''
cries
the
landlord
;
``
nay
,
*NL*
like
enough
,
for
I
heard
it
only
a
few
minutes
ago
;
and
if
I
had
never
*NL*
heard
it
,
may
the
devil
fly
away
with
me
this
instant
if
I
would
have
*NL*
betrayed
your
honour
!
no
,
if
I
would
,
may
I
--
''
Here
he
subjoined
*NL*
several
dreadful
imprecations
,
which
Sophia
at
last
interrupted
,
and
*NL*
begged
to
know
what
he
meant
by
the
news
.
--
He
was
going
to
answer
,
*NL*
when
Mrs
Honour
came
running
into
the
room
,
all
pale
and
breathless
,
*NL*
and
cried
out
,
``
Madam
,
we
are
all
undone
,
all
ruined
,
they
are
come
,
*NL*
they
are
come
!
''
These
words
almost
froze
up
the
blood
of
Sophia
;
but
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
asked
Honour
who
were
come
?
--
``
Who
?
''
answered
she
,
*NL*
``
why
,
the
French
;
several
hundred
thousands
of
them
are
landed
,
and
we
*NL*
shall
be
all
murdered
and
ravished
.

*NL*
*NL*
As
a
miser
,
who
hath
,
in
some
well-built
city
,
a
cottage
,
value
twenty
*NL*
shillings
,
when
at
a
distance
he
is
alarmed
with
the
news
of
a
fire
,
*NL*
turns
pale
and
trembles
at
his
loss
;
but
when
he
finds
the
beautiful
*NL*
palaces
only
are
burnt
,
and
his
own
cottage
remains
safe
,
he
comes
*NL*
instantly
to
himself
,
and
smiles
at
his
good
fortunes
:
or
as
-LRB-
for
we
*NL*
dislike
something
in
the
former
simile
-RRB-
the
tender
mother
,
when
*NL*
terrified
with
the
apprehension
that
her
darling
boy
is
drowned
,
is
*NL*
struck
senseless
and
almost
dead
with
consternation
;
but
when
she
is
*NL*
told
that
little
master
is
safe
,
and
the
Victory
only
,
with
twelve
*NL*
hundred
brave
men
,
gone
to
the
bottom
,
life
and
sense
again
return
,
*NL*
maternal
fondness
enjoys
the
sudden
relief
from
all
its
fears
,
and
the
*NL*
general
benevolence
which
at
another
time
would
have
deeply
felt
the
*NL*
dreadful
catastrophe
,
lies
fast
asleep
in
her
mind
;
--
so
Sophia
,
than
*NL*
whom
none
was
more
capable
of
tenderly
feeling
the
general
calamity
of
*NL*
her
country
,
found
such
immediate
satisfaction
from
the
relief
of
*NL*
those
terrors
she
had
of
being
overtaken
by
her
father
,
that
the
*NL*
arrival
of
the
French
scarce
made
any
impression
on
her
.
She
gently
*NL*
chid
her
maid
for
the
fright
into
which
she
had
thrown
her
,
and
said
*NL*
``
she
was
glad
it
was
no
worse
;
for
that
she
had
feared
somebody
else
*NL*
was
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
quoth
the
landlord
,
smiling
,
``
her
ladyship
knows
better
*NL*
things
;
she
knows
the
French
are
our
very
best
friends
,
and
come
over
*NL*
hither
only
for
our
good
.
They
are
the
people
who
are
to
make
Old
*NL*
England
flourish
again
.
I
warrant
her
honour
thought
the
duke
was
*NL*
coming
;
and
that
was
enough
to
put
her
into
a
fright
.
I
was
going
to
*NL*
tell
your
ladyship
the
news
.
--
His
honour
's
majesty
,
Heaven
bless
him
,
*NL*
hath
given
the
duke
the
slip
,
and
is
marching
as
fast
as
he
can
to
*NL*
London
,
and
ten
thousand
French
are
landed
to
join
him
on
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
was
not
greatly
pleased
with
this
news
,
nor
with
the
gentleman
*NL*
who
related
it
;
but
,
as
she
still
imagined
he
knew
her
-LRB-
for
she
could
*NL*
not
possibly
have
any
suspicion
of
the
real
truth
-RRB-
,
she
durst
not
show
*NL*
any
dislike
.
And
now
the
landlord
,
having
removed
the
cloth
from
the
*NL*
table
,
withdrew
;
but
at
his
departure
frequently
repeated
his
hopes
of
*NL*
being
remembered
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mind
of
Sophia
was
not
at
all
easy
under
the
supposition
of
being
*NL*
known
at
this
house
;
for
she
still
applied
to
herself
many
things
*NL*
which
the
landlord
had
addressed
to
Jenny
Cameron
;
she
therefore
*NL*
ordered
her
maid
to
pump
out
of
him
by
what
means
he
had
become
*NL*
acquainted
with
her
person
,
and
who
had
offered
him
the
reward
for
*NL*
betraying
her
;
she
likewise
ordered
the
horses
to
be
in
readiness
by
*NL*
four
in
the
morning
,
at
which
hour
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
promised
to
bear
*NL*
her
company
;
and
then
,
composing
herself
as
well
as
she
could
,
she
*NL*
desired
that
lady
to
continue
her
story
.

Chapter
vii

In
which
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
concludes
her
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Mrs
Honour
,
in
pursuance
of
the
commands
of
her
mistress
,
*NL*
ordered
a
bowl
of
punch
,
and
invited
my
landlord
and
landlady
to
*NL*
partake
of
it
,
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
thus
went
on
with
her
relation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
of
the
officers
who
were
quartered
at
a
town
in
our
*NL*
neighbourhood
were
of
my
husband
's
acquaintance
.
Among
these
there
was
*NL*
a
lieutenant
,
a
very
pretty
sort
of
man
,
and
who
was
married
to
a
*NL*
woman
,
so
agreeable
both
in
her
temper
and
conversation
,
that
from
our
*NL*
first
knowing
each
other
,
which
was
soon
after
my
lying-in
,
we
were
*NL*
almost
inseparable
companions
;
for
I
had
the
good
fortune
to
make
*NL*
myself
equally
agreeable
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lieutenant
,
who
was
neither
a
sot
nor
a
sportsman
,
was
frequently
*NL*
of
our
parties
;
indeed
he
was
very
little
with
my
husband
,
and
no
more
*NL*
than
good
breeding
constrained
him
to
be
,
as
he
lived
almost
*NL*
constantly
at
our
house
.
My
husband
often
expressed
much
*NL*
dissatisfaction
at
the
lieutenant
's
preferring
my
company
to
his
;
he
*NL*
was
very
angry
with
me
on
that
account
,
and
gave
me
many
a
hearty
*NL*
curse
for
drawing
away
his
companions
;
saying
,
`
I
ought
to
be
d
--
n
'd
*NL*
for
having
spoiled
one
of
the
prettiest
fellows
in
the
world
,
by
*NL*
making
a
milksop
of
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
mistaken
,
my
dear
Sophia
,
if
you
imagine
that
the
anger
*NL*
of
my
husband
arose
from
my
depriving
him
of
a
companion
;
for
the
*NL*
lieutenant
was
not
a
person
with
whose
society
a
fool
could
be
*NL*
pleased
;
and
,
if
I
should
admit
the
possibility
of
this
,
so
little
*NL*
right
had
my
husband
to
place
the
loss
of
his
companion
to
me
,
that
I
*NL*
am
convinced
it
was
my
conversation
alone
which
induced
him
ever
to
*NL*
come
to
the
house
.
No
,
child
,
it
was
envy
,
the
worst
and
most
*NL*
rancorous
kind
of
envy
,
the
envy
of
superiority
of
understanding
.
The
*NL*
wretch
could
not
bear
to
see
my
conversation
preferred
to
his
,
by
a
*NL*
man
of
whom
he
could
not
entertain
the
least
jealousy
.
O
my
dear
*NL*
Sophy
,
you
are
a
woman
of
sense
;
if
you
marry
a
man
,
as
is
most
*NL*
probable
you
will
,
of
less
capacity
than
yourself
,
make
frequent
*NL*
trials
of
his
temper
before
marriage
,
and
see
whether
he
can
bear
to
*NL*
submit
to
such
a
superiority
.
--
Promise
me
,
Sophy
,
you
will
take
this
*NL*
advice
;
for
you
will
hereafter
find
its
importance
.
''
``
It
is
very
*NL*
likely
I
shall
never
marry
at
all
,
''
answered
Sophia
;
``
I
think
,
at
*NL*
least
,
I
shall
never
marry
a
man
in
whose
understanding
I
see
any
*NL*
defects
before
marriage
;
and
I
promise
you
I
would
rather
give
up
my
*NL*
own
than
see
any
such
afterwards
.
''
``
Give
up
your
understanding
!
''
*NL*
replied
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
``
oh
,
fie
,
child
!
I
will
not
believe
so
meanly
*NL*
of
you
.
Everything
else
I
might
myself
be
brought
to
give
up
;
but
*NL*
never
this
.
Nature
would
not
have
allotted
this
superiority
to
the
*NL*
wife
in
so
many
instances
,
if
she
had
intended
we
should
all
of
us
*NL*
have
surrendered
it
to
the
husband
.
This
,
indeed
,
men
of
sense
never
*NL*
expect
of
us
;
of
which
the
lieutenant
I
have
just
mentioned
was
one
*NL*
notable
example
;
for
though
he
had
a
very
good
understanding
,
he
*NL*
always
acknowledged
-LRB-
as
was
really
true
-RRB-
that
his
wife
had
a
better
.
*NL*
And
this
,
perhaps
,
was
one
reason
of
the
hatred
my
tyrant
bore
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
he
would
be
so
governed
by
a
wife
,
he
said
,
especially
such
an
*NL*
ugly
b
--
-LRB-
for
,
indeed
,
she
was
not
a
regular
beauty
,
but
very
*NL*
agreeable
and
extremely
genteel
-RRB-
,
he
would
see
all
the
women
upon
*NL*
earth
at
the
devil
,
which
was
a
very
usual
phrase
with
him
.
He
said
,
*NL*
he
wondered
what
I
could
see
in
her
to
be
so
charmed
with
her
company
:
*NL*
since
this
woman
,
says
he
,
hath
come
among
us
,
there
is
an
end
of
your
*NL*
beloved
reading
,
which
you
pretended
to
like
so
much
,
that
you
could
*NL*
not
afford
time
to
return
the
visits
of
the
ladies
in
this
country
;
*NL*
and
I
must
confess
I
had
been
guilty
of
a
little
rudeness
this
way
;
*NL*
for
the
ladies
there
are
at
least
no
better
than
the
mere
country
*NL*
ladies
here
;
and
I
think
I
need
make
no
other
excuse
to
you
for
*NL*
declining
any
intimacy
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
correspondence
,
however
,
continued
a
whole
year
,
even
all
the
*NL*
while
the
lieutenant
was
quartered
in
that
town
;
for
which
I
was
*NL*
contented
to
pay
the
tax
of
being
constantly
abused
in
the
manner
*NL*
above
mentioned
by
my
husband
;
I
mean
when
he
was
at
home
;
for
he
was
*NL*
frequently
absent
a
month
at
a
time
at
Dublin
,
and
once
made
a
journey
*NL*
of
two
months
to
London
:
in
all
which
journeys
I
thought
it
a
very
*NL*
singular
happiness
that
he
never
once
desired
my
company
;
nay
,
by
his
*NL*
frequent
censures
on
men
who
could
not
travel
,
as
he
phrased
it
,
*NL*
without
a
wife
tied
up
to
their
tail
,
he
sufficiently
intimated
that
,
*NL*
had
I
been
never
so
desirous
of
accompanying
him
,
my
wishes
would
have
*NL*
been
in
vain
;
but
,
Heaven
knows
,
such
wishes
were
very
far
from
my
*NL*
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
length
my
friend
was
removed
from
me
,
and
I
was
again
left
to
my
*NL*
solitude
,
to
the
tormenting
conversation
with
my
own
reflections
,
and
*NL*
to
apply
to
books
for
my
only
comfort
.
I
now
read
almost
all
day
long
.
*NL*
How
many
books
do
you
think
I
read
in
three
months
?
''
``
I
ca
n't
guess
,
*NL*
indeed
,
cousin
,
''
answered
Sophia
.
``
Perhaps
half
a
score
.
''
``
Half
a
*NL*
score
!
half
a
thousand
,
child
!
''
answered
the
other
.
``
I
read
a
good
*NL*
deal
in
Daniel
's
English
History
of
France
;
a
great
deal
in
Plutarch
's
*NL*
Lives
,
the
Atalantis
,
Pope
's
Homer
,
Dryden
's
Plays
,
Chillingworth
,
the
*NL*
Countess
D'Aulnois
,
and
Locke
's
Human
Understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
During
this
interval
I
wrote
three
very
supplicating
,
and
,
I
thought
,
*NL*
moving
letters
to
my
aunt
;
but
,
as
I
received
no
answer
to
any
of
*NL*
them
,
my
disdain
would
not
suffer
me
to
continue
my
application
.
''
Here
*NL*
she
stopt
,
and
,
looking
earnestly
at
Sophia
,
said
,
``
Methinks
,
my
dear
,
*NL*
I
read
something
in
your
eyes
which
reproaches
me
of
a
neglect
in
*NL*
another
place
,
where
I
should
have
met
with
a
kinder
return
.
''
``
Indeed
,
*NL*
dear
Harriet
,
''
answered
Sophia
,
``
your
story
is
an
apology
for
any
*NL*
neglect
;
but
,
indeed
,
I
feel
that
I
have
been
guilty
of
a
remissness
,
*NL*
without
so
good
an
excuse
.
--
Yet
pray
proceed
;
for
I
long
,
though
I
*NL*
tremble
,
to
hear
the
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
then
,
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
resumed
her
narrative
:
--
``
My
husband
now
*NL*
took
a
second
journey
to
England
,
where
he
continued
upwards
of
three
*NL*
months
;
during
the
greater
part
of
this
time
I
led
a
life
which
*NL*
nothing
but
having
led
a
worse
could
make
me
think
tolerable
;
for
*NL*
perfect
solitude
can
never
be
reconciled
to
a
social
mind
,
like
mine
,
*NL*
but
when
it
relieves
you
from
the
company
of
those
you
hate
.
What
*NL*
added
to
my
wretchedness
was
the
loss
of
my
little
infant
:
not
that
I
*NL*
pretend
to
have
had
for
it
that
extravagant
tenderness
of
which
I
*NL*
believe
I
might
have
been
capable
under
other
circumstances
;
but
I
*NL*
resolved
,
in
every
instance
,
to
discharge
the
duty
of
the
tenderest
*NL*
mother
;
and
this
care
prevented
me
from
feeling
the
weight
of
that
*NL*
heaviest
of
all
things
,
when
it
can
be
at
all
said
to
lie
heavy
on
our
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
spent
full
ten
weeks
almost
entirely
by
myself
,
having
seen
*NL*
nobody
all
that
time
,
except
my
servants
and
a
very
few
visitors
,
when
*NL*
a
young
lady
,
a
relation
to
my
husband
,
came
from
a
distant
part
of
*NL*
Ireland
to
visit
me
.
She
had
staid
once
before
a
week
at
my
house
,
and
*NL*
then
I
gave
her
a
pressing
invitation
to
return
;
for
she
was
a
very
*NL*
agreeable
woman
,
and
had
improved
good
natural
parts
by
a
proper
*NL*
education
.
Indeed
,
she
was
to
me
a
welcome
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
few
days
after
her
arrival
,
perceiving
me
in
very
low
spirits
,
*NL*
without
enquiring
the
cause
,
which
,
indeed
,
she
very
well
knew
,
the
*NL*
young
lady
fell
to
compassionating
my
case
.
She
said
,
`
Though
*NL*
politeness
had
prevented
me
from
complaining
to
my
husband
's
relations
*NL*
of
his
behaviour
,
yet
they
all
were
very
sensible
of
it
,
and
felt
*NL*
great
concern
upon
that
account
;
but
none
more
than
herself
.
'
And
*NL*
after
some
more
general
discourse
on
this
head
,
which
I
own
I
could
*NL*
not
forbear
countenancing
,
at
last
,
after
much
previous
precaution
and
*NL*
enjoined
concealment
,
she
communicated
to
me
,
as
a
profound
*NL*
secret
--
that
my
husband
kept
a
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
certainly
imagine
I
heard
this
news
with
the
utmost
*NL*
insensibility
--
Upon
my
word
,
if
you
do
,
your
imagination
will
mislead
*NL*
you
.
Contempt
had
not
so
kept
down
my
anger
to
my
husband
,
but
that
*NL*
hatred
rose
again
on
this
occasion
.
What
can
be
the
reason
of
this
?
*NL*
Are
we
so
abominably
selfish
,
that
we
can
be
concerned
at
others
*NL*
having
possession
even
of
what
we
despise
?
Or
are
we
not
rather
*NL*
abominably
vain
,
and
is
not
this
the
greatest
injury
done
to
our
*NL*
vanity
?
What
think
you
,
Sophia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
indeed
,
''
answered
Sophia
;
``
I
have
never
troubled
myself
*NL*
with
any
of
these
deep
contemplations
;
but
I
think
the
lady
did
very
*NL*
ill
in
communicating
to
you
such
a
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
my
dear
,
this
conduct
is
natural
,
''
replied
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
*NL*
``
and
,
when
you
have
seen
and
read
as
much
as
myself
,
you
will
*NL*
acknowledge
it
to
be
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
is
natural
,
''
returned
Sophia
;
``
for
I
want
*NL*
neither
reading
nor
experience
to
convince
me
that
it
is
very
*NL*
dishonourable
and
very
ill-natured
:
nay
,
it
is
surely
as
ill-bred
to
*NL*
tell
a
husband
or
wife
of
the
faults
of
each
other
as
to
tell
them
of
*NL*
their
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
continued
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
``
my
husband
at
last
returned
;
and
,
*NL*
if
I
am
thoroughly
acquainted
with
my
own
thoughts
,
I
hated
him
now
*NL*
more
than
ever
;
but
I
despised
him
rather
less
:
for
certainly
nothing
*NL*
so
much
weakens
our
contempt
,
as
an
injury
done
to
our
pride
or
our
*NL*
vanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
now
assumed
a
carriage
to
me
so
very
different
from
what
he
had
*NL*
lately
worn
,
and
so
nearly
resembling
his
behaviour
the
first
week
of
*NL*
our
marriage
,
that
,
had
I
now
had
any
spark
of
love
remaining
,
he
*NL*
might
,
possibly
,
have
rekindled
my
fondness
for
him
.
But
,
though
*NL*
hatred
may
succeed
to
contempt
,
and
may
perhaps
get
the
better
of
it
,
*NL*
love
,
I
believe
,
can
not
.
The
truth
is
,
the
passion
of
love
is
too
*NL*
restless
to
remain
contented
without
the
gratification
which
it
*NL*
receives
from
its
object
;
and
one
can
no
more
be
inclined
to
love
*NL*
without
loving
than
we
can
have
eyes
without
seeing
.
When
a
husband
,
*NL*
therefore
,
ceases
to
be
the
object
of
this
passion
,
it
is
most
*NL*
probable
some
other
man
--
I
say
,
my
dear
,
if
your
husband
grows
*NL*
indifferent
to
you
--
if
you
once
come
to
despise
him
--
I
say
--
that
*NL*
is
--
if
you
have
the
passion
of
love
in
you
--
Lud
!
I
have
bewildered
*NL*
myself
so
--
but
one
is
apt
,
in
these
abstracted
considerations
,
to
lose
*NL*
the
concatenation
of
ideas
,
as
Mr
Locke
says
:
--
in
short
,
the
truth
*NL*
is
--
in
short
,
I
scarce
know
what
it
is
;
but
,
as
I
was
saying
,
my
*NL*
husband
returned
,
and
his
behaviour
,
at
first
,
greatly
surprized
me
;
*NL*
but
he
soon
acquainted
me
with
the
motive
,
and
taught
me
to
account
*NL*
for
it
.
In
a
word
,
then
,
he
had
spent
and
lost
all
the
ready
money
of
*NL*
my
fortune
;
and
,
as
he
could
mortgage
his
own
estate
no
deeper
,
he
was
*NL*
now
desirous
to
supply
himself
with
cash
for
his
extravagance
,
by
*NL*
selling
a
little
estate
of
mine
,
which
he
could
not
do
without
my
*NL*
assistance
;
and
to
obtain
this
favour
was
the
whole
and
sole
motive
of
*NL*
all
the
fondness
which
he
now
put
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
I
peremptorily
refused
to
comply
.
I
told
him
,
and
I
told
*NL*
him
truly
,
that
,
had
I
been
possessed
of
the
Indies
at
our
first
*NL*
marriage
,
he
might
have
commanded
it
all
;
for
it
had
been
a
constant
*NL*
maxim
with
me
,
that
where
a
woman
disposes
of
her
heart
,
she
should
*NL*
always
deposit
her
fortune
;
but
,
as
he
had
been
so
kind
,
long
ago
,
to
*NL*
restore
the
former
into
my
possession
,
I
was
resolved
likewise
to
*NL*
retain
what
little
remained
of
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
describe
to
you
the
passion
into
which
these
words
,
and
*NL*
the
resolute
air
in
which
they
were
spoken
,
threw
him
:
nor
will
I
*NL*
trouble
you
with
the
whole
scene
which
succeeded
between
us
.
Out
came
,
*NL*
you
may
be
well
assured
,
the
story
of
the
mistress
;
and
out
it
did
*NL*
come
,
with
all
the
embellishments
which
anger
and
disdain
could
bestow
*NL*
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Fitzpatrick
seemed
a
little
thunderstruck
with
this
,
and
more
*NL*
confused
than
I
had
seen
him
,
though
his
ideas
are
always
confused
*NL*
enough
,
heaven
knows
.
He
did
not
,
however
,
endeavour
to
exculpate
*NL*
himself
;
but
took
a
method
which
almost
equally
confounded
me
.
What
*NL*
was
this
but
recrimination
?
He
affected
to
be
jealous
:
--
he
may
,
for
*NL*
aught
I
know
,
be
inclined
enough
to
jealousy
in
his
natural
temper
;
*NL*
nay
,
he
must
have
had
it
from
nature
,
or
the
devil
must
have
put
it
*NL*
into
his
head
;
for
I
defy
all
the
world
to
cast
a
just
aspersion
on
my
*NL*
character
:
nay
,
the
most
scandalous
tongues
have
never
dared
censure
*NL*
my
reputation
.
My
fame
,
I
thank
heaven
,
hath
been
always
as
spotless
*NL*
as
my
life
;
and
let
falsehood
itself
accuse
that
if
it
dare
.
No
,
my
*NL*
dear
Graveairs
,
however
provoked
,
however
ill-treated
,
however
injured
*NL*
in
my
love
,
I
have
firmly
resolved
never
to
give
the
least
room
for
*NL*
censure
on
this
account
.
--
And
yet
,
my
dear
,
there
are
some
people
so
*NL*
malicious
,
some
tongues
so
venomous
,
that
no
innocence
can
escape
*NL*
them
.
The
most
undesigned
word
,
the
most
accidental
look
,
the
least
*NL*
familiarity
,
the
most
innocent
freedom
,
will
be
misconstrued
,
and
*NL*
magnified
into
I
know
not
what
,
by
some
people
.
But
I
despise
,
my
dear
*NL*
Graveairs
,
I
despise
all
such
slander
.
No
such
malice
,
I
assure
you
,
*NL*
ever
gave
me
an
uneasy
moment
.
No
,
no
,
I
promise
you
I
am
above
all
*NL*
that
.
--
But
where
was
I
?
O
let
me
see
,
I
told
you
my
husband
was
*NL*
jealous
--
And
of
whom
,
I
pray
?
--
Why
,
of
whom
but
the
lieutenant
I
*NL*
mentioned
to
you
before
!
He
was
obliged
to
resort
above
a
year
and
*NL*
more
back
to
find
any
object
for
this
unaccountable
passion
,
if
,
*NL*
indeed
,
he
really
felt
any
such
,
and
was
not
an
arrant
counterfeit
in
*NL*
order
to
abuse
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
tired
you
already
with
too
many
particulars
.
I
will
now
*NL*
bring
my
story
to
a
very
speedy
conclusion
.
In
short
,
then
,
after
many
*NL*
scenes
very
unworthy
to
be
repeated
,
in
which
my
cousin
engaged
so
*NL*
heartily
on
my
side
,
that
Mr
Fitzpatrick
at
last
turned
her
out
of
*NL*
doors
;
when
he
found
I
was
neither
to
be
soothed
nor
bullied
into
*NL*
compliance
,
he
took
a
very
violent
method
indeed
.
Perhaps
you
will
*NL*
conclude
he
beat
me
;
but
this
,
though
he
hath
approached
very
near
to
*NL*
it
,
he
never
actually
did
.
He
confined
me
to
my
room
,
without
*NL*
suffering
me
to
have
either
pen
,
ink
,
paper
,
or
book
:
and
a
servant
*NL*
every
day
made
my
bed
,
and
brought
me
my
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
had
remained
a
week
under
this
imprisonment
,
he
made
me
a
*NL*
visit
,
and
,
with
the
voice
of
a
schoolmaster
,
or
,
what
is
often
much
*NL*
the
same
,
of
a
tyrant
,
asked
me
,
`
If
I
would
yet
comply
?
'
I
answered
,
*NL*
very
stoutly
,
`
That
I
would
die

Here
I
remained
a
fortnight
longer
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
my
*NL*
constancy
was
almost
subdued
,
and
I
began
to
think
of
submission
;
*NL*
when
,
one
day
,
in
the
absence
of
my
husband
,
who
was
gone
abroad
for
*NL*
some
short
time
,
by
the
greatest
good
fortune
in
the
world
,
an
*NL*
accident
happened
.
--
I
--
at
a
time
when
I
began
to
give
way
to
the
*NL*
utmost
despair
--
everything
would
be
excusable
at
such
a
time
--
at
*NL*
that
very
time
I
received
--
But
it
would
take
up
an
hour
to
tell
you
*NL*
all
particulars
.

In
one
word
,
then
-LRB-
for
I
will
not
tire
you
with
*NL*
circumstances
-RRB-

gold

key
to

opened
my
door
,
*NL*
and
set
me
at
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
now
made
haste
to
Dublin
,
where
I
immediately
procured
a
passage
to
*NL*
England
;
and
was
proceeding
to
Bath
,
in
order
to
throw
myself
into
the
*NL*
protection
of
my
aunt
,
or
of
your
father
,
or
of
any
relation
who
would
*NL*
afford
it
me
.
My
husband
overtook
me
last
night
at
the
inn
where
I
*NL*
lay
,
and
which
you
left
a
few
minutes
before
me
;

I
had
the
good
*NL*
luck
to
escape
him
,
and
to
follow
you

*NL*
``
And
thus
,
my
dear

ends
my
history
:
a
tragical
one
,
I
am
sure
,
it
is
*NL*
to
myself
;
but
,
perhaps
,
I
ought
rather
to
apologize
to
you
for
its
*NL*
dullness

*NL*
Sophia
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
answered
,
``
Indeed

Harriet
,
I
pity
you
*NL*
from
my
soul
!

But
what
could
you
expect
?
Why
,
why
,
would
you
marry
*NL*
an
Irishman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
''
replied
her
cousin
,
``
your
censure
is
unjust
.
There
*NL*
are
,
among
the
Irish
,
men
of
as
much
worth
and
honour
as
any
among
the
*NL*
English
:
nay
,
to
speak
the
truth
,
generosity
of
spirit
is
rather
more
*NL*
common
among
them
.
I
have
known
some
examples
there
,
too
,
of
good
*NL*
husbands
;
and
I
believe
these
are
not
very
plenty
in
England
.
Ask
me
,
*NL*
rather
,
what
I
could
expect
when
I
married
a
fool
;
and
I
will
tell
you
*NL*
a
solemn
truth
;
I
did
not
know
him
to
be
so
.

``
Can
no

Sophia

in
a
very
low
and
altered
voice
,
``
do
you
think

make
a
bad
*NL*
husband

who
is
not
a
fool

''
``
That

''
answered
the
other

``
is
too
*NL*
general
a
negative
;
but
none

I
believe

is
so
likely
as
a
fool
to
*NL*
prove
so
.
Among
my
acquaintance
,
the
silliest
fellows
are
the
worst
*NL*
husbands
;
and
I
will
venture
to
assert
,
as
a
fact
,
that
a
man
of
sense
*NL*
rarely
behaves
very
ill
to
a
wife
who
deserves
very

*NL*
A
dreadful
alarm
in
the
inn
,
with
the
arrival
of
an
unexpected
friend
*NL*
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
now
,
at
the
desire
of
her
cousin
,
related
--
not
what
follows
,
*NL*
but
what
hath
gone
before
in
this
history
:
for
which
reason
the
reader
*NL*
will
,
I
suppose
,
excuse
me
for
not
repeating
it
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
remark
,
however
,
I
can
not
forbear
making
on
her
narrative
,
namely
,
*NL*
that
she
made
no
more
mention
of
Jones
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
,
*NL*
than
if
there
had
been
no
such
person
alive
.
This
I
will
neither
*NL*
endeavour
to
account
for
nor
to
excuse
.
Indeed
,
if
this
may
be
called
*NL*
a
kind
of
dishonesty
,
it
seems
the
more
inexcusable
,
from
the
apparent
*NL*
openness
and
explicit
sincerity
of
the
other
lady
.
--
But
so
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
Sophia
arrived
at
the
conclusion
of
her
story
,
there
arrived
*NL*
in
the
room
where
the
two
ladies
were
sitting
a
noise
,
not
unlike
,
in
*NL*
loudness
,
to
that
of
a
pack
of
hounds
just
let
out
from
their
kennel
;
*NL*
nor

in
shrillness

to

to

indeed
,
more
like

can
resemble
a

-RRB-
to
*NL*
those
sounds
which
,
in
the
pleasant
mansions
of
that
gate
which
seems
*NL*
to
derive
its
name
from
a
duplicity
of
tongues
,
issue
from
the
mouths
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
from
the
nostrils
,
of
those
fair
river
nymphs

ycleped

of

the
Naiades

in

vulgar

for
when

instead
of
the
antient
libations
of
milk
and
honey
and
oil
,
*NL*
the
rich
distillation
from
the
juniper-berry
,
or
,
perhaps
,
from
malt
,
*NL*
hath
,
by
the
early
devotion
of
their
votaries
,
been
poured
forth
in
*NL*
great
abundance
,
should
any
daring
tongue
with
unhallowed
license
*NL*
prophane
,
_
i.e.

,
depreciate
,
the
delicate
fat
Milton
oyster
,
the
*NL*
plaice
sound
and
firm
,
the
flounder
as
much
alive
as
when
in
the
*NL*
water
,
the
shrimp
as
big
as
a
prawn
,
the
fine
cod
alive
but
a
few
*NL*
hours
ago

any
other
of
the
various
treasures
which
those
*NL*
water-deities
who
fish

have
committed
to
the
care

of
the
nymphs

the
angry
Naiades
lift
up
their
immortal
voices
,

*NL*
the
prophane
wretch
is
struck
deaf
for
his
impiety

*NL*
Such
was
the
noise
which
now
burst
from
one
of
the
rooms
below
;
and
*NL*
soon
the
thunder
,
which
long
had
rattled
at
a
distance
,
began
to
*NL*
approach
nearer
and
nearer
,
till
,
having
ascended
by
degrees
upstairs
,
*NL*
it
at
last
entered
the
apartment
where
the

were

In
short
,
to
*NL*
drop
all
metaphor

figure
,
Mrs
Honour
,
having
scolded
violently
*NL*
below-stairs
,
and
continued
the
same
all
the
way
up

came
in
to
her
*NL*
mistress
in

most
outrageous
passion

crying
out

clawed

The
principal
uneasiness
with
which
Sophia
was
affected
on
this
*NL*
occasion
Honour
had
herself
caused
,
by
having
in
her
passion
*NL*
discovered
who
she
was
.
However
,
as
this
mistake
of
the
landlord
*NL*
sufficiently
accounted
for
those
passages
which
Sophia
had
before
*NL*
mistaken
,
she
acquired
some
ease
on
that
account
;
nor
could
she
,
upon
*NL*
the
whole
,
forbear
smiling
.
This
enraged
Honour
,
and
she
cried
,
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
I
did
not
think
your
ladyship
would
have
made
a
*NL*
laughing
matter
of
it

To
be
called
whore
by
such
an
impudent
low

Your

may
be
angry

me

for
aught
I
know
,
for
*NL*
taking
your
part

since
proffered
service

they
say

stinks

but
to
be
*NL*
sure
I
could
never
bear
to
hear
a
lady
of
mine
called
whore
.
--
Nor
will
*NL*
I
bear
it
.
I
am
sure
your
ladyship
is
as
virtuous
a
lady
as
ever
sat
*NL*
foot
on
English
ground
,
and
I
will
claw
any
villain

eyes
out
who
*NL*
dares
for
to
offer
to
presume
for
to
say
the
least
word
to
the
*NL*
contrary

Nobody

Hinc
illae

in
plain
truth

Honour
had
as
much
love
for
*NL*
her
mistress
as
most
servants
have
,
that
is
to
say
--
But
besides
this
,
*NL*
her
pride
obliged
her
to
support
the
character
of
the
lady
she
waited
*NL*
on
;
for
she
thought
her
own
was
in
a
very
close
manner
connected
with
*NL*
it
.
In
proportion
as
the
character
of
her
mistress
was
raised
,
hers
*NL*
likewise
,
as
she
conceived
,
was
raised
with
it
;
and
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
she
thought
the
one
could
not
be
lowered
without
the
other

*NL*
On
this
subject
,
reader
,
I
must
stop
a
moment
,
to
tell
thee
a
story
.
*NL*
``
The
famous
Nell
Gwynn
,
stepping
one
day
,
from
a
house
where
she
had
*NL*
made
a
short
visit
,
into
her
coach
,
saw
a
great
mob
assembled
,
and
her
*NL*
footman
all
bloody
and
dirty
;
the
fellow
,
being
asked
by
his
mistress
*NL*
the
reason
of
his
being
in
that
condition
,
answered
,
`
I
have
been
*NL*
fighting
,
madam
,
with
an
impudent
rascal
who
called
your
ladyship
a
*NL*
wh
--
re
.
'
`
You
blockhead
,
'
replied
Mrs
Gwynn
,
`
at
this
rate
you
must
*NL*
fight
every
day
of
your
life
;
why
,
you
fool
,
all
the
world
knows
it
.
'
*NL*
`
Do
they
?
'
cries
the
fellow
,
in
a
muttering
voice
,
after
he
had
shut
*NL*
the
coach-door
,
`
they
sha
n't
call
me
a
whore
's
footman
for
all
that
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
passion
of
Mrs
Honour
appears
natural
enough
,
even
if
it
were
*NL*
to
be
no
otherwise
accounted
for
;
but
,
in
reality
,
there
was
another
*NL*
cause
of
her
anger
;
for
which
we
must
beg
leave
to
remind
our
reader
*NL*
of
a
circumstance
mentioned
in
the
above
simile
.
There
are
indeed
*NL*
certain
liquors
,
which
,
being
applied
to
our
passions
,
or
to
fire
,
*NL*
produce
effects
the
very
reverse
of
those
produced
by
water
,
as
they
*NL*
serve
to
kindle
and
inflame
,
rather
than
to
extinguish
.
Among
these
,
*NL*
the
generous
liquor
called
punch
is
one
.
It
was
not
,
therefore
,
*NL*
without
reason
,
that
the
learned
Dr
Cheney
used
to
call
drinking
punch
*NL*
pouring
liquid
fire
down
your
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Mrs
Honour
had
unluckily
poured
so
much
of
this
liquid
fire
down
*NL*
her
throat
,
that
the
smoke
of
it
began
to
ascend
into
her
pericranium
*NL*
and
blinded
the
eyes
of
Reason
,
which
is
there
supposed
to
keep
her
*NL*
residence
,
while
the
fire
itself
from
the
stomach
easily
reached
the
*NL*
heart
,
and
there
inflamed
the
noble
passion
of
pride
.
So
that
,
upon
*NL*
the
whole
,
we
shall
cease
to
wonder
at
the
violent
rage
of
the
*NL*
waiting-woman
;
though
at
first
sight
we
must
confess
the
cause
seems
*NL*
inadequate
to
the
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
and
her
cousin
both
did
all
in
their
power
to
extinguish
these
*NL*
flames
which
had
roared
so
loudly
all
over
the
house
.
They
at
length
*NL*
prevailed
;
or
,
to
carry
the
metaphor
one
step
farther
,
the
fire
,
*NL*
having
consumed
all
the
fuel
which
the
language
affords
,
to
wit
,
every
*NL*
reproachful
term
in
it
,
at
last
went
out
of
its
own
accord
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
though
tranquillity
was
restored
above-stairs
,
it
was
not
so
*NL*
below
;
where
my
landlady
,
highly
resenting
the
injury
done
to
the
*NL*
beauty
of
her
husband
by
the
flesh-spades
of
Mrs
Honour
,
called
aloud
*NL*
for
revenge
and
justice
.
As
to
the
poor
man
,
who
had
principally
*NL*
suffered
in
the
engagement
,
he
was
perfectly
quiet
.
Perhaps
the
blood
*NL*
which
he
lost
might
have
cooled
his
anger
:
for
the
enemy
had
not
only
*NL*
applied
her
nails
to
his
cheeks
,
but
likewise
her
fist
to
his
*NL*
nostrils
,
which
lamented
the
blow
with
tears
of
blood
in
great
*NL*
abundance
.
To
this
we
may
add
reflections
on
his
mistake
;
but
indeed
*NL*
nothing
so
effectually
silenced
his
resentment
as
the
manner
in
which
*NL*
he
now
discovered
his
error
;
for
as
to
the
behaviour
of
Mrs
Honour
,
it
*NL*
had
the
more
confirmed
him
in
his
opinion
;
but
he
was
now
assured
by
a
*NL*
person
of
great
figure
,
and
who
was
attended
by
a
great
equipage
,
that
*NL*
one
of
the
ladies
was
a
woman
of
fashion
,
and
his
intimate
*NL*
acquaintance
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
orders
of
this
person
,
the
landlord
now
ascended
,
and
*NL*
acquainted
our
fair
travellers
that
a
great
gentleman
below
desired
to
*NL*
do
them
the
honour
of
waiting
on
them
.
Sophia
turned
pale
and
trembled
*NL*
at
this
message
,
though
the
reader
will
conclude
it
was
too
civil
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
landlord
's
blunder
,
to
have
come
from
her
father
;
*NL*
but
fear
hath
the
common
fault
of
a
justice
of
peace
,
and
is
apt
to
*NL*
conclude
hastily
from
every
slight
circumstance
,
without
examining
the
*NL*
evidence
on
both
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
ease
the
reader
's
curiosity
,
therefore
,
rather
than
his
*NL*
apprehensions
,
we
proceed
to
inform
him
that
an
Irish
peer
had
arrived
*NL*
very
late
that
evening
at
the
inn
,
in
his
way
to
London
.
This
*NL*
nobleman
,
having
sallied
from
his
supper
at
the
hurricane
before
*NL*
commemorated
,
had
seen
the
attendant
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
and
upon
a
*NL*
short
enquiry
,
was
informed
that
her
lady
,
with
whom
he
was
very
*NL*
particularly
acquainted
,
was
above
.
This
information
he
had
no
sooner
*NL*
received
than
he
addressed
himself
to
the
landlord
,
pacified
him
,
and
*NL*
sent
him
upstairs
with
compliments
rather
civiller
than
those
which
*NL*
were
delivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
perhaps
be
wondered
at
that
the
waiting-woman
herself
was
not
*NL*
the
messenger
employed
on
this
occasion
;
but
we
are
sorry
to
say
she
*NL*
was
not
at
present
qualified
for
that
,
or
indeed
for
any
other
office
.
*NL*
The
rum
-LRB-
for
so
the
landlord
chose
to
call
the
distillation
from
malt
-RRB-
*NL*
had
basely
taken
the
advantage
of
the
fatigue
which
the
poor
woman
had
*NL*
undergone
,
and
had
made
terrible
depredations
on
her
noble
faculties
,
*NL*
at
a
time
when
they
were
very
unable
to
resist
the
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
not
describe
this
tragical
scene
too
fully
;
but
we
thought
*NL*
ourselves
obliged
,
by
that
historic
integrity
which
we
profess
,
*NL*
shortly
to
hint
a
matter
which
we
would
otherwise
have
been
glad
to
*NL*
have
spared
.
Many
historians
,
indeed
,
for
want
of
this
integrity
,
or
*NL*
of
diligence
,
to
say
no
worse
,
often
leave
the
reader
to
find
out
*NL*
these
little
circumstances
in
the
dark
,
and
sometimes
to
his
great
*NL*
confusion
and
perplexity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
was
very
soon
eased
of
her
causeless
fright
by
the
entry
of
the
*NL*
noble
peer
,
who
was
not
only
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
Mrs
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
,
but
in
reality
a
very
particular
friend
of
that
lady
.
To
*NL*
say
truth
,
it
was
by
his
assistance
that
she
had
been
enabled
to
*NL*
escape
from
her
husband
;
for
this
nobleman
had
the
same
gallant
*NL*
disposition
with
those
renowned
knights
of
whom
we
read
in
heroic
*NL*
story
,
and
had
delivered
many
an
imprisoned
nymph
from
durance
.
He
was
*NL*
indeed
as
bitter
an
enemy
to
the
savage
authority
too
often
exercised
*NL*
by
husbands
and
fathers
,
over
the
young
and
lovely
of
the
other
sex
,
*NL*
as
ever
knight-errant
was
to
the
barbarous
power
of
enchanters
;
nay
,
*NL*
to
say
truth
,
I
have
often
suspected
that
those
very
enchanters
with
*NL*
which
romance
everywhere
abounds
were
in
reality
no
other
than
the
*NL*
husbands
of
those
days
;
and
matrimony
itself
was
,
perhaps
,
the
*NL*
enchanted
castle
in
which
the
nymphs
were
said
to
be
confined
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
nobleman
had
an
estate
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Fitzpatrick
,
and
*NL*
had
been
for
some
time
acquainted
with
the
lady
.
No
sooner
,
therefore
,
*NL*
did
he
hear
of
her
confinement
,
than
he
earnestly
applied
himself
to
*NL*
procure
her
liberty
;
which
he
presently
effected
,
not
by
storming
the
*NL*
castle
,
according
to
the
example
of
antient
heroes
,
but
by
corrupting
*NL*
the
governor
,
in
conformity
with
the
modern
art
of
war
,
in
which
craft
*NL*
is
held
to
be
preferable
to
valour
,
and
gold
is
found
to
be
more
*NL*
irresistible
than
either
lead
or
steel
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
circumstance
,
however
,
as
the
lady
did
not
think
it
material
*NL*
enough
to
relate
to
her
friend
,
we
would
not
at
that
time
impart
it
to
*NL*
the
reader
.
We
rather
chose
to
leave
him
a
while
under
a
supposition
*NL*
that
she
had
found
,
or
coined
,
or
by
some
very
extraordinary
,
perhaps
*NL*
supernatural
means
,
had
possessed
herself
of
the
money
with
which
she
*NL*
had
bribed
her
keeper
,
than
to
interrupt
her
narrative
by
giving
a
*NL*
hint
of
what
seemed
to
her
of
too
little
importance
to
be
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
peer
,
after
a
short
conversation
,
could
not
forbear
expressing
*NL*
some
surprize
at
meeting
the
lady
in
that
place
;
nor
could
he
refrain
*NL*
from
telling
her
he
imagined
she
had
been
gone
to
Bath
.
Mrs
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
very
freely
answered
,
``
That
she
had
been
prevented
in
her
*NL*
purpose
by
the
arrival
of
a
person
she
need
not
mention
.
In
short
,
''
*NL*
says
she
,
``
I
was
overtaken
by
my
husband
-LRB-
for
I
need
not
affect
to
*NL*
conceal
what
the
world
knows
too
well
already
-RRB-
.
I
had
the
good
fortune
*NL*
to
escape
in
a
most
surprizing
manner
,
and
am
now
going
to
London
with
*NL*
this
young
lady
,
who
is
a
near
relation
of
mine
,
and
who
hath
escaped
*NL*
from
as
great
a
tyrant
as
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
lordship
,
concluding
that
this
tyrant
was
likewise
a
husband
,
made
*NL*
a
speech
full
of
compliments
to
both
the
ladies
,
and
as
full
of
*NL*
invectives
against
his
own
sex
;
nor
indeed
did
he
avoid
some
oblique
*NL*
glances
at
the
matrimonial
institution
itself
,
and
at
the
unjust
*NL*
powers
given
by
it
to
man
over
the
more
sensible
and
more
meritorious
*NL*
part
of
the
species
.
He
ended
his
oration
with
an
offer
of
his
*NL*
protection
,
and
of
his
coach
and
six
,
which
was
instantly
accepted
by
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
and
at
last
,
upon
her
persuasions
,
by
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matters
being
thus
adjusted
,
his
lordship
took
his
leave
,
and
the
*NL*
ladies
retired
to
rest
,
where
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
entertained
her
cousin
*NL*
with
many
high
encomiums
on
the
character
of
the
noble
peer
,
and
*NL*
enlarged
very
particularly
on
his
great
fondness
for
his
wife
;
saying
,
*NL*
she
believed
he
was
almost
the
only
person
of
high
rank
who
was
*NL*
entirely
constant
to
the
marriage
bed
.
``
Indeed
,
''
added
she
,
``
my
dear
*NL*
Sophy
,
that
is
a
very
rare
virtue
amongst
men
of
condition
.
Never
*NL*
expect
it
when
you
marry
;
for
,
believe
me
,
if
you
do
,
you
will
*NL*
certainly
be
deceived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
gentle
sigh
stole
from
Sophia
at
these
words
,
which
perhaps
*NL*
contributed
to
form
a
dream
of
no
very
pleasant
kind
;
but
,
as
she
*NL*
never
revealed
this
dream
to
any
one
,
so
the
reader
can
not
expect
to
*NL*
see
it
related
here
.

Chapter
ix
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
introduced
in
some
pretty
writing
.
A
stagecoach
.
The
*NL*
civility
of
chambermaids
.
The
heroic
temper
of
Sophia
.
Her
generosity
.
*NL*
The
return
to
it
.
The
departure
of
the
company
,
and
their
arrival
at
*NL*
London
;
with
some
remarks
for
the
use
of
travellers
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Those
members
of
society
who
are
born
to
furnish
the
blessings
of
life
*NL*
now
began
to
light
their
candles
,
in
order
to
pursue
their
daily
*NL*
labours
for
the
use
of
those
who
are
born
to
enjoy
these
blessings
.
*NL*
The
sturdy
hind
now
attends
the
levee
of
his
fellow-labourer
the
ox
;
*NL*
the
cunning
artificer
,
the
diligent
mechanic
,
spring
from
their
hard
*NL*
mattress
;
and
now
the
bonny
housemaid
begins
to
repair
the
disordered
*NL*
drum-room
,
while
the
riotous
authors
of
that
disorder
,
in
broken
*NL*
interrupted
slumbers
,
tumble
and
toss
,
as
if
the
hardness
of
down
*NL*
disquieted
their
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
simple
phrase
,
the
clock
had
no
sooner
struck
seven
than
the
ladies
*NL*
were
ready
for
their
journey
;
and
,
at
their
desire
,
his
lordship
and
*NL*
his
equipage
were
prepared
to
attend
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
arose
;
and
this
was
how
his
*NL*
lordship
himself
should
be
conveyed
;
for
though
in
stage-coaches
,
*NL*
where
passengers
are
properly
considered
as
so
much
luggage
,
the
*NL*
ingenious
coachman
stows
half
a
dozen
with
perfect
ease
into
the
place
*NL*
of
four
;
for
well
he
contrives
that
the
fat
hostess
,
or
well-fed
*NL*
alderman
,
may
take
up
no
more
room
than
the
slim
miss
,
or
taper
*NL*
master
;
it
being
the
nature
of
guts
,
when
well
squeezed
,
to
give
way
,
*NL*
and
to
lie
in
a
narrow
compass
;
yet
in
these
vehicles
,
which
are
*NL*
called
,
for
distinction
's
sake
,
gentlemen
's
coaches
,
though
they
are
*NL*
often
larger
than
the
others
,
this
method
of
packing
is
never
*NL*
attempted
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
lordship
would
have
put
a
short
end
to
the
difficulty
,
by
very
*NL*
gallantly
desiring
to
mount
his
horse
;
but
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
would
by
no
*NL*
means
consent
to
it
.
It
was
therefore
concluded
that
the
Abigails
*NL*
should
,
by
turns
,
relieve
each
other
on
one
of
his
lordship
's
horses
,
*NL*
which
was
presently
equipped
with
a
side-saddle
for
that
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
being
settled
at
the
inn
,
the
ladies
discharged
their
*NL*
former
guides
,
and
Sophia
made
a
present
to
the
landlord
,
partly
to
*NL*
repair
the
bruise
which
he
had
received
under
herself
,
and
partly
on
*NL*
account
of
what
he
had
suffered
under
the
hands
of
her
enraged
*NL*
waiting-woman
.
And
now
Sophia
first
discovered
a
loss
which
gave
her
*NL*
some
uneasiness
;
and
this
was
of
the
hundred-pound
bank-bill
which
her
*NL*
father
had
given
her
at
their
last
meeting
;
and
which
,
within
a
very
*NL*
inconsiderable
trifle
,
was
all
the
treasure
she
was
at
present
worth
.
*NL*
She
searched
everywhere
,
and
shook
and
tumbled
all
her
things
to
no
*NL*
purpose
,
the
bill
was
not
to
be
found
:
and
she
was
at
last
fully
*NL*
persuaded
that
she
had
lost
it
from
her
pocket
when
she
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
of
tumbling
from
her
horse
in
the
dark
lane
,
as
before
*NL*
recorded
:
a
fact
that
seemed
the
more
probable
,
as
she
now
recollected
*NL*
some
discomposure
in
her
pockets
which
had
happened
at
that
time
,
and
*NL*
the
great
difficulty
with
which
she
had
drawn
forth
her
handkerchief
*NL*
the
very
instant
before
her
fall
,
in
order
to
relieve
the
distress
of
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Misfortunes
of
this
kind
,
whatever
inconveniencies
they
may
be
*NL*
attended
with
,
are
incapable
of
subduing
a
mind
in
which
there
is
any
*NL*
strength
,
without
the
assistance
of
avarice
.
Sophia
,
therefore
,
though
*NL*
nothing
could
be
worse
timed
than
this
accident
at
such
a
season
,
*NL*
immediately
got
the
better
of
her
concern
,
and
,
with
her
wonted
*NL*
serenity
and
cheerfulness
of
countenance
,
returned
to
her
company
.
His
*NL*
lordship
conducted
the
ladies
into
the
vehicle
,
as
he
did
likewise
Mrs
*NL*
Honour
,
who
,
after
many
civilities
,
and
more
dear
madams
,
at
last
*NL*
yielded
to
the
well-bred
importunities
of
her
sister
Abigail
,
and
*NL*
submitted
to
be
complimented
with
the
first
ride
in
the
coach
;
in
*NL*
which
indeed
she
would
afterwards
have
been
contented
to
have
pursued
*NL*
her
whole
journey
,
had
not
her
mistress
,
after
several
fruitless
*NL*
intimations
,
at
length
forced
her
to
take
her
turn
on
horseback
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coach
,
now
having
received
its
company
,
began
to
move
forwards
,
*NL*
attended
by
many
servants
,
and
led
by
two
captains
,
who
had
before
*NL*
rode
with
his
lordship
,
and
who
would
have
been
dismissed
from
the
*NL*
vehicle
upon
a
much
less
worthy
occasion
than
was
this
of
*NL*
accommodating
two
ladies
.
In
this
they
acted
only
as
gentlemen
;
but
*NL*
they
were
ready
at
any
time
to
have
performed
the
office
of
a
footman
,
*NL*
or
indeed
would
have
condescended
lower
,
for
the
honour
of
his
*NL*
lordship
's
company
,
and
for
the
convenience
of
his
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
landlord
was
so
pleased
with
the
present
he
had
received
from
*NL*
Sophia
,
that
he
rather
rejoiced
in
than
regretted
his
bruise
or
his
*NL*
scratches
.
The
reader
will
perhaps
be
curious
to
know
the
_
quantum
_
of
*NL*
this
present
;
but
we
can
not
satisfy
his
curiosity
.
Whatever
it
was
,
it
*NL*
satisfied
the
landlord
for
his
bodily
hurt
;
but
he
lamented
he
had
not
*NL*
known
before
how
little
the
lady
valued
her
money
;
``
For
to
be
sure
,
''
*NL*
says
he
,
``
one
might
have
charged
every
article
double
,
and
she
would
*NL*
have
made
no
cavil
at
the
reckoning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
,
however
,
was
far
from
drawing
this
conclusion
;
whether
she
*NL*
really
felt
any
injury
done
to
her
husband
more
than
he
did
himself
,
I
*NL*
will
not
say
:
certain
it
is
,
she
was
much
less
satisfied
with
the
*NL*
generosity
of
Sophia
.
``
Indeed
,
''
cries
she
,
``
my
dear
,
the
lady
knows
*NL*
better
how
to
dispose
of
her
money
than
you
imagine
.
She
might
very
*NL*
well
think
we
should
not
put
up
such
a
business
without
some
*NL*
satisfaction
,
and
the
law
would
have
cost
her
an
infinite
deal
more
*NL*
than
this
poor
little
matter
,
which
I
wonder
you
would
take
.
''
``
You
are
*NL*
always
so
bloodily
wise
,
''
quoth
the
husband
:
``
it
would
have
cost
her
*NL*
more
,
would
it
?
dost
fancy
I
do
n't
know
that
as
well
as
thee
?
but
*NL*
would
any
of
that
more
,
or
so
much
,
have
come
into
our
pockets
?
*NL*
Indeed
,
if
son
Tom
the
lawyer
had
been
alive
,
I
could
have
been
glad
*NL*
to
have
put
such
a
pretty
business
into
his
hands
.
He
would
have
got
a
*NL*
good
picking
out
of
it
;
but
I
have
no
relation
now
who
is
a
lawyer
,
*NL*
and
why
should
I
go
to
law
for
the
benefit
of
strangers
?
''
``
Nay
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
''
answered
she
,
``
you
must
know
best
.
''
``
I
believe
I
do
,
''
replied
*NL*
he
.
``
I
fancy
,
when
money
is
to
be
got
,
I
can
smell
it
out
as
well
as
*NL*
another
.
Everybody
,
let
me
tell
you
,
would
not
have
talked
people
out
*NL*
of
this
.
Mind
that
,
I
say
;
everybody
would
not
have
cajoled
this
out
*NL*
of
her
,
mind
that
.
''
The
wife
then
joined
in
the
applause
of
her
*NL*
husband
's
sagacity
;
and
thus
ended
the
short
dialogue
between
them
on
*NL*
this
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
therefore
take
our
leave
of
these
good
people
,
and
attend
his
*NL*
lordship
and
his
fair
companions
,
who
made
such
good
expedition
that
*NL*
they
performed
a
journey
of
ninety
miles
in
two
days
,
and
on
the
*NL*
second
evening
arrived
in
London
,
without
having
encountered
any
one
*NL*
adventure
on
the
road
worthy
the
dignity
of
this
history
to
relate
.
*NL*
Our
pen
,
therefore
,
shall
imitate
the
expedition
which
it
describes
,
*NL*
and
our
history
shall
keep
pace
with
the
travellers
who
are
its
*NL*
subject
.
Good
writers
will
,
indeed
,
do
well
to
imitate
the
ingenious
*NL*
traveller
in
this
instance
,
who
always
proportions
his
stay
at
any
*NL*
place
to
the
beauties
,
elegancies
,
and
curiosities
which
it
affords
.
*NL*
At
Eshur
,
at
Stowe
,
at
Wilton
,
at
Eastbury
,
and
at
Prior
's
Park
,
days
*NL*
are
too
short
for
the
ravished
imagination
;
while
we
admire
the
*NL*
wondrous
power
of
art
in
improving
nature
.
In
some
of
these
,
art
*NL*
chiefly
engages
our
admiration
;
in
others
,
nature
and
art
contend
for
*NL*
our
applause
;
but
,
in
the
last
,
the
former
seems
to
triumph
.
Here
*NL*
Nature
appears
in
her
richest
attire
,
and
Art
,
dressed
with
the
*NL*
modestest
simplicity
,
attends
her
benignant
mistress
.
Here
Nature
*NL*
indeed
pours
forth
the
choicest
treasures
which
she
hath
lavished
on
*NL*
this
world
;
and
here
human
nature
presents
you
with
an
object
which
*NL*
can
be
exceeded
only
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
taste
,
the
same
imagination
,
which
luxuriously
riots
in
these
*NL*
elegant
scenes
,
can
be
amused
with
objects
of
far
inferior
note
.
The
*NL*
woods
,
the
rivers
,
the
lawns
of
Devon
and
of
Dorset
,
attract
the
eye
*NL*
of
the
ingenious
traveller
,
and
retard
his
pace
,
which
delay
he
*NL*
afterwards
compensates
by
swiftly
scouring
over
the
gloomy
heath
of
*NL*
Bagshot
,
or
that
pleasant
plain
which
extends
itself
westward
from
*NL*
Stockbridge
,
where
no
other
object
than
one
single
tree
only
in
*NL*
sixteen
miles
presents
itself
to
the
view
,
unless
the
clouds
,
in
*NL*
compassion
to
our
tired
spirits
,
kindly
open
their
variegated
mansions
*NL*
to
our
prospect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
so
travels
the
money-meditating
tradesman
,
the
sagacious
justice
,
*NL*
the
dignified
doctor
,
the
warm-clad
grazier
,
with
all
the
numerous
*NL*
offspring
of
wealth
and
dulness
.
On
they
jog
,
with
equal
pace
,
through
*NL*
the
verdant
meadows
or
over
the
barren
heath
,
their
horses
measuring
*NL*
four
miles
and
a
half
per
hour
with
the
utmost
exactness
;
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
beast
and
of
his
master
being
alike
directed
forwards
,
and
*NL*
employed
in
contemplating
the
same
objects
in
the
same
manner
.
With
*NL*
equal
rapture
the
good
rider
surveys
the
proudest
boasts
of
the
*NL*
architect
,
and
those
fair
buildings
with
which
some
unknown
name
hath
*NL*
adorned
the
rich
cloathing
town
;
where
heaps
of
bricks
are
piled
up
as
*NL*
a
kind
of
monument
to
show
that
heaps
of
money
have
been
piled
there
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
reader
,
as
we
are
in
haste
to
attend
our
heroine
,
we
will
*NL*
leave
to
thy
sagacity
to
apply
all
this
to
the
Boeotian
writers
,
and
*NL*
to
those
authors
who
are
their
opposites
.
This
thou
wilt
be
abundantly
*NL*
able
to
perform
without
our
aid
.
Bestir
thyself
therefore
on
this
*NL*
occasion
;
for
,
though
we
will
always
lend
thee
proper
assistance
in
*NL*
difficult
places
,
as
we
do
not
,
like
some
others
,
expect
thee
to
use
*NL*
the
arts
of
divination
to
discover
our
meaning
,
yet
we
shall
not
*NL*
indulge
thy
laziness
where
nothing
but
thy
own
attention
is
required
;
*NL*
for
thou
art
highly
mistaken
if
thou
dost
imagine
that
we
intended
,
*NL*
when
we
began
this
great
work
,
to
leave
thy
sagacity
nothing
to
do
;
or
*NL*
that
,
without
sometimes
exercising
this
talent
,
thou
wilt
be
able
to
*NL*
travel
through
our
pages
with
any
pleasure
or
profit
to
thyself

Chapter
x.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
a
hint
or
two
concerning
virtue
,
and
a
few
more
concerning
*NL*
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Our
company
,
being
arrived
at
London
,
were
set
down
at
his
lordship
's
*NL*
house
,
where
,
while
they
refreshed
themselves
after
the
fatigue
of
*NL*
their
journey
,
servants
were
despatched
to
provide
a
lodging
for
the
*NL*
two
ladies
;
for
,
as
her
ladyship
was
not
then
in
town
,
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
*NL*
would
by
no
means
consent
to
accept
a
bed
in
the
mansion
of
the
peer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
readers
will
,
perhaps
,
condemn
this
extraordinary
delicacy
,
as
I
*NL*
may
call
it
,
of
virtue
,
as
too
nice
and
scrupulous
;
but
we
must
make
*NL*
allowances
for
her
situation
,
which
must
be
owned
to
have
been
very
*NL*
ticklish
;
and
,
when
we
consider
the
malice
of
censorious
tongues
,
we
*NL*
must
allow
,
if
it
was
a
fault
,
the
fault
was
an
excess
on
the
right
*NL*
side
,
and
which
every
woman
who
is
in
the
self-same
situation
will
do
*NL*
well
to
imitate
.
The
most
formal
appearance
of
virtue
,
when
it
is
only
*NL*
an
appearance
,
may
,
perhaps
,
in
very
abstracted
considerations
,
seem
*NL*
to
be
rather
less
commendable
than
virtue
itself
without
this
*NL*
formality
;
but
it
will
,
however
,
be
always
more
commended
;
and
this
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
will
be
granted
by
all
,
that
it
is
necessary
,
unless
in
some
*NL*
very
particular
cases
,
for
every
woman
to
support
either
the
one
or
*NL*
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lodging
being
prepared
,
Sophia
accompanied
her
cousin
for
that
*NL*
evening
;
but
resolved
early
in
the
morning
to
enquire
after
the
lady
*NL*
into
whose
protection
,
as
we
have
formerly
mentioned
,
she
had
*NL*
determined
to
throw
herself
when
she
quitted
her
father
's
house
.
And
*NL*
this
she
was
the
more
eager
in
doing
from
some
observations
she
had
*NL*
made
during
her
journey
in
the
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
we
would
by
no
means
fix
the
odious
character
of
suspicion
on
*NL*
Sophia
,
we
are
almost
afraid
to
open
to
our
reader
the
conceits
which
*NL*
filled
her
mind
concerning
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
of
whom
she
certainly
*NL*
entertained
at
present
some
doubts
;
which
,
as
they
are
very
apt
to
*NL*
enter
into
the
bosoms
of
the
worst
of
people
,
we
think
proper
not
to
*NL*
mention
more
plainly
till
we
have
first
suggested
a
word
or
two
to
our
*NL*
reader
touching
suspicion
in
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
there
have
always
appeared
to
me
to
be
two
degrees
.
The
first
*NL*
of
these
I
chuse
to
derive
from
the
heart
,
as
the
extreme
velocity
of
*NL*
its
discernment
seems
to
denote
some
previous
inward
impulse
,
and
the
*NL*
rather
as
this
superlative
degree
often
forms
its
own
objects
;
sees
*NL*
what
is
not
,
and
always
more
than
really
exists
.
This
is
that
*NL*
quick-sighted
penetration
whose
hawk
's
eyes
no
symptom
of
evil
can
*NL*
escape
;
which
observes
not
only
upon
the
actions
,
but
upon
the
words
*NL*
and
looks
,
of
men
;
and
,
as
it
proceeds
from
the
heart
of
the
observer
,
*NL*
so
it
dives
into
the
heart
of
the
observed
,
and
there
espies
evil
,
as
*NL*
it
were
,
in
the
first
embryo
;
nay
,
sometimes
before
it
can
be
said
to
*NL*
be
conceived
.
An
admirable
faculty
,
if
it
were
infallible
;
but
,
as
this
*NL*
degree
of
perfection
is
not
even
claimed
by
more
than
one
mortal
being
;
*NL*
so
from
the
fallibility
of
such
acute
discernment
have
arisen
many
sad
*NL*
mischiefs
and
most
grievous
heart-aches
to
innocence
and
virtue
.
I
*NL*
can
not
help
,
therefore
,
regarding
this
vast
quick-sightedness
into
evil
*NL*
as
a
vicious
excess
,
and
as
a
very
pernicious
evil
in
itself
.
And
I
am
*NL*
the
more
inclined
to
this
opinion
,
as
I
am
afraid
it
always
proceeds
*NL*
from
a
bad
heart
,
for
the
reasons
I
have
above
mentioned
,
and
for
one
*NL*
more
,
namely
,
because
I
never
knew
it
the
property
of
a
good
one
.
Now
,
*NL*
from
this
degree
of
suspicion
I
entirely
and
absolutely
acquit
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
degree
of
this
quality
seems
to
arise
from
the
head
.
This
is
,
*NL*
indeed
,
no
other
than
the
faculty
of
seeing
what
is
before
your
eyes
,
*NL*
and
of
drawing
conclusions
from
what
you
see
.
The
former
of
these
is
*NL*
unavoidable
by
those
who
have
any
eyes
,
and
the
latter
is
perhaps
no
*NL*
less
certain
and
necessary
a
consequence
of
our
having
any
brains
.
*NL*
This
is
altogether
as
bitter
an
enemy
to
guilt
as
the
former
is
to
*NL*
innocence
:
nor
can
I
see
it
in
an
unamiable
light
,
even
though
,
*NL*
through
human
fallibility
,
it
should
be
sometimes
mistaken
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
if
a
husband
should
accidentally
surprize
his
wife
in
the
*NL*
lap
or
in
the
embraces
of
some
of
those
pretty
young
gentlemen
who
*NL*
profess
the
art
of
cuckold-making
,
I
should
not
highly
,
I
think
,
blame
*NL*
him
for
concluding
something
more
than
what
he
saw
,
from
the
*NL*
familiarities
which
he
really
had
seen
,
and
which
we
are
at
least
*NL*
favourable
enough
to
when
we
call
them
innocent
freedoms
.
The
reader
*NL*
will
easily
suggest
great
plenty
of
instances
to
himself
;
I
shall
add
*NL*
but
one
more
,
which
,
however
unchristian
it
may
be
thought
by
some
,
I
*NL*
can
not
help
esteeming
to
be
strictly
justifiable
;
and
this
is
a
*NL*
suspicion
that
a
man
is
capable
of
doing
what
he
hath
done
already
,
*NL*
and
that
it
is
possible
for
one
who
hath
been
a
villain
once
to
act
*NL*
the
same
part
again
.
And
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
of
this
degree
of
*NL*
suspicion
I
believe
Sophia
was
guilty
.
From
this
degree
of
suspicion
*NL*
she
had
,
in
fact
,
conceived
an
opinion
that
her
cousin
was
really
not
*NL*
better
than
she
should
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
,
it
seems
,
was
this
:
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
wisely
considered
that
*NL*
the
virtue
of
a
young
lady
is
,
in
the
world
,
in
the
same
situation
*NL*
with
a
poor
hare
,
which
is
certain
,
whenever
it
ventures
abroad
,
to
*NL*
meet
its
enemies
;
for
it
can
hardly
meet
any
other
.
No
sooner
*NL*
therefore
was
she
determined
to
take
the
first
opportunity
of
quitting
*NL*
the
protection
of
her
husband
,
than
she
resolved
to
cast
herself
under
*NL*
the
protection
of
some
other
man
;
and
whom
could
she
so
properly
*NL*
choose
to
be
her
guardian
as
a
person
of
quality
,
of
fortune
,
of
*NL*
honour
;
and
who
,
besides
a
gallant
disposition
which
inclines
men
to
*NL*
knight-errantry
,
that
is
,
to
be
the
champions
of
ladies
in
distress
,
*NL*
had
often
declared
a
violent
attachment
to
herself
,
and
had
already
*NL*
given
her
all
the
instances
of
it
in
his
power
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
as
the
law
hath
foolishly
omitted
this
office
of
vice-husband
,
or
*NL*
guardian
to
an
eloped
lady
,
and
as
malice
is
apt
to
denominate
him
by
*NL*
a
more
disagreeable
appellation
,
it
was
concluded
that
his
lordship
*NL*
should
perform
all
such
kind
offices
to
the
lady
in
secret
,
and
*NL*
without
publickly
assuming
the
character
of
her
protector
.
Nay
,
to
*NL*
prevent
any
other
person
from
seeing
him
in
this
light
,
it
was
agreed
*NL*
that
the
lady
should
proceed
directly
to
Bath
,
and
that
his
lordship
*NL*
should
first
go
to
London
,
and
thence
should
go
down
to
that
place
by
*NL*
the
advice
of
his
physicians
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
all
this
Sophia
very
plainly
understood
,
not
from
the
lips
or
*NL*
behaviour
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
but
from
the
peer
,
who
was
infinitely
*NL*
less
expert
at
retaining
a
secret
than
was
the
good
lady
;
and
perhaps
*NL*
the
exact
secrecy
which
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
had
observed
on
this
head
in
*NL*
her
narrative
served
not
a
little
to
heighten
those
suspicions
which
*NL*
were
now
risen
in
the
mind
of
her
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
very
easily
found
out
the
lady
she
sought
;
for
indeed
there
was
*NL*
not
a
chairman
in
town
to
whom
her
house
was
not
perfectly
well
known
;
*NL*
and
,
as
she
received
,
in
return
of
her
first
message
,
a
most
pressing
*NL*
invitation
,
she
immediately
accepted
it
.
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
indeed
,
did
*NL*
not
desire
her
cousin
to
stay
with
her
with
more
earnestness
than
*NL*
civility
required
.
Whether
she
had
discerned
and
resented
the
*NL*
suspicion
above-mentioned
,
or
from
what
other
motive
it
arose
,
I
*NL*
can
not
say
;
but
certain
it
is
,
she
was
full
as
desirous
of
parting
*NL*
with
Sophia
as
Sophia
herself
could
be
of
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
,
when
she
came
to
take
leave
of
her
cousin
,
could
not
*NL*
avoid
giving
her
a
short
hint
of
advice
.
She
begged
her
,
for
heaven
's
*NL*
sake
,
to
take
care
of
herself
,
and
to
consider
in
how
dangerous
a
*NL*
situation
she
stood
;
adding
,
she
hoped
some
method
would
be
found
of
*NL*
reconciling
her
to
her
husband
.
``
You
must
remember
,
my
dear
,
''
says
*NL*
she
,
``
the
maxim
which
my
aunt
Western
hath
so
often
repeated
to
us
*NL*
both
;
That
whenever
the
matrimonial
alliance
is
broke
,
and
war
*NL*
declared
between
husband
and
wife
,
she
can
hardly
make
a
*NL*
disadvantageous
peace
for
herself
on
any
conditions
.
These
are
my

's
very

,
and
she
hath
had
a
great
deal
of
experience
in
the
*NL*
world
.
''
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
answered
,
with
a
contemptuous
smile
,
``
Never
*NL*
fear
me
,
child
,
take
care
of
yourself
;
for
you
are
younger
than
I.
I
*NL*
will
come
and
visit
you
in
a
few
days
;
but
,
dear
Sophy
,
let
me
give
*NL*
you
one
piece
of
advice
:
leave
the
character
of
Graveairs
in
the
*NL*
country
,
for
,
believe
me
,
it
will
sit
very
awkwardly
upon
you
in
this
*NL*
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
two
cousins
parted
,
and
Sophia
repaired
directly
to
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
,
where
she
found
a
most
hearty
,
as
well
as
a
most
polite
,
*NL*
welcome
.
The
lady
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
her
when
she
had
seen
her
*NL*
formerly
with
her
aunt
Western
.
She
was
indeed
extremely
glad
to
see
*NL*
her
,
and
was
no
sooner
acquainted
with
the
reasons
which
induced
her
*NL*
to
leave
the
squire
and
to
fly
to
London
than
she
highly
applauded
her
*NL*
sense
and
resolution
;
and
after
expressing
the
highest
satisfaction
in
*NL*
the
opinion
which
Sophia
had
declared
she
entertained
of
her
ladyship
,
*NL*
by
chusing
her
house
for
an
asylum
,
she
promised
her
all
the
*NL*
protection
which
it
was
in
her
power
to
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
now
brought
Sophia
into
safe
hands
,
the
reader
will
,
I
*NL*
apprehend
,
be
contented
to
deposit
her
there
a
while
,
and
to
look
a
*NL*
little
after
other
personages
,
and
particularly
poor
Jones
,
whom
we
*NL*
have
left
long
enough
to
do
penance
for
his
past
offences
,
which
,
as
*NL*
is
the
nature
of
vice
,
brought
sufficient
punishment
upon
him
*NL*
themselves
.

*NL*
Chapter
i.
*NL*
*NL*
Showing
what
is
to
be
deemed
plagiarism
in
a
modern
author
,
and
what
*NL*
is
to
be
considered
as
lawful
prize
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
learned
reader
must
have
observed
that
in
the
course
of
this
*NL*
mighty
work
,
I
have
often
translated
passages
out
of
the
best
antient
*NL*
authors
,
without
quoting
the
original
,
or
without
taking
the
least
*NL*
notice
of
the
book
from
whence
they
were
borrowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
conduct
in
writing
is
placed
in
a
very
proper
light
by
the
*NL*
ingenious
Abbe
Bannier
,
in
his
preface
to
his
Mythology
,
a
work
of
*NL*
great
erudition
and
of
equal
judgment
.
``
It
will
be
easy
,
''
says
he
,
*NL*
``
for
the
reader
to
observe
that
I
have
frequently
had
greater
regard
*NL*
to
him
than
to
my
own
reputation
:
for
an
author
certainly
pays
him
a
*NL*
considerable
compliment
,
when
,
for
his
sake
,
he
suppresses
learned
*NL*
quotations
that
come
in
his
way
,
and
which
would
have
cost
him
but
the
*NL*
bare
trouble
of
transcribing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
fill
up
a
work
with
these
scraps
may
,
indeed
,
be
considered
as
a
*NL*
downright
cheat
on
the
learned
world
,
who
are
by
such
means
imposed
*NL*
upon
to
buy
a
second
time
,
in
fragments
and
by
retail
,
what
they
have
*NL*
already
in
gross
,
if
not
in
their
memories
,
upon
their
shelves
;
and
it
*NL*
is
still
more
cruel
upon
the
illiterate
,
who
are
drawn
in
to
pay
for
*NL*
what
is
of
no
manner
of
use
to
them
.
A
writer
who
intermixes
great
*NL*
quantity
of
Greek
and
Latin
with
his
works
,
deals
by
the
ladies
and
*NL*
fine
gentlemen
in
the
same
paultry
manner
with
which
they
are
treated
*NL*
by
the
auctioneers
,
who
often
endeavour
so
to
confound
and
mix
up
*NL*
their
lots
,
that
,
in
order
to
purchase
the
commodity
you
want
,
you
are
*NL*
obliged
at
the
same
time
to
purchase
that
which
will
do
you
no
*NL*
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
as
there
is
no
conduct
so
fair
and
disinterested
but
that
it
*NL*
may
be
misunderstood
by
ignorance
,
and
misrepresented
by
malice
,
I
*NL*
have
been
sometimes
tempted
to
preserve
my
own
reputation
at
the
*NL*
expense
of
my
reader
,
and
to
transcribe
the
original
,
or
at
least
to
*NL*
quote
chapter
and
verse
,
whenever
I
have
made
use
either
of
the
*NL*
thought
or
expression
of
another
.
I
am
,
indeed
,
in
some
doubt
that
I
*NL*
have
often
suffered
by
the
contrary
method
;
and
that
,
by
suppressing
*NL*
the
original
author
's
name
,
I
have
been
rather
suspected
of
plagiarism
*NL*
than
reputed
to
act
from
the
amiable
motive
assigned
by
that
justly
*NL*
celebrated
Frenchman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
to
obviate
all
such
imputations
for
the
future
,
I
do
here
confess
*NL*
and
justify
the
fact
.
The
antients
may
be
considered
as
a
rich
common
,
*NL*
where
every
person
who
hath
the
smallest
tenement
in
Parnassus
hath
a
*NL*
free
right
to
fatten
his
muse
.
Or
,
to
place
it
in
a
clearer
light
,
we
*NL*
moderns
are
to
the
antients
what
the
poor
are
to
the
rich
.
By
the
poor
*NL*
here
I
mean
that
large
and
venerable
body
which
,
in
English
,
we
call
*NL*
the
mob
.
Now
,
whoever
hath
had
the
honour
to
be
admitted
to
any
degree
*NL*
of
intimacy
with
this
mob
,
must
well
know
that
it
is
one
of
their
*NL*
established
maxims
to
plunder
and
pillage
their
rich
neighbours
*NL*
without
any
reluctance
;
and
that
this
is
held
to
be
neither
sin
nor
*NL*
shame
among
them
.
And
so
constantly
do
they
abide
and
act
by
this
*NL*
maxim
,
that
,
in
every
parish
almost
in
the
kingdom
,
there
is
a
kind
of
*NL*
confederacy
ever
carrying
on
against
a
certain
person
of
opulence
*NL*
called
the
squire
,
whose
property
is
considered
as
free-booty
by
all
*NL*
his
poor
neighbours
;
who
,
as
they
conclude
that
there
is
no
manner
of
*NL*
guilt
in
such
depredations
,
look
upon
it
as
a
point
of
honour
and
*NL*
moral
obligation
to
conceal
,
and
to
preserve
each
other
from
*NL*
punishment
on
all
such
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
like
manner
are
the
antients
,
such
as
Homer
,
Virgil
,
Horace
,
*NL*
Cicero
,
and
the
rest
,
to
be
esteemed
among
us
writers
,
as
so
many
*NL*
wealthy
squires
,
from
whom
we
,
the
poor
of
Parnassus
,
claim
an
*NL*
immemorial
custom
of
taking
whatever
we
can
come
at
.
This
liberty
I
*NL*
demand
,
and
this
I
am
as
ready
to
allow
again
to
my
poor
neighbours
in
*NL*
their
turn
.
All
I
profess
,
and
all
I
require
of
my
brethren
,
is
to
*NL*
maintain
the
same
strict
honesty
among
ourselves
which
the
mob
show
to
*NL*
one
another
.
To
steal
from
one
another
is
indeed
highly
criminal
and
*NL*
indecent
;
for
this
may
be
strictly
stiled
defrauding
the
poor
*NL*
-LRB-
sometimes
perhaps
those
who
are
poorer
than
ourselves
-RRB-
,
or
,
to
set
it
*NL*
under
the
most
opprobrious
colours
,
robbing
the
spittal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
,
therefore
,
upon
the
strictest
examination
,
my
own
conscience
*NL*
can
not
lay
any
such
pitiful
theft
to
my
charge
,
I
am
contented
to
*NL*
plead
guilty
to
the
former
accusation
;
nor
shall
I
ever
scruple
to
*NL*
take
to
myself
any
passage
which
I
shall
find
in
an
antient
author
to
*NL*
my
purpose
,
without
setting
down
the
name
of
the
author
from
whence
it
*NL*
was
taken
.
Nay
,
I
absolutely
claim
a
property
in
all
such
sentiments
*NL*
the
moment
they
are
transcribed
into
my
writings
,
and
I
expect
all
*NL*
readers
henceforwards
to
regard
them
as
purely
and
entirely
my
own
.
*NL*
This
claim
,
however
,
I
desire
to
be
allowed
me
only
on
condition
that
*NL*
I
preserve
strict
honesty
towards
my
poor
brethren
,
from
whom
,
if
ever
*NL*
I
borrow
any
of
that
little
of
which
they
are
possessed
,
I
shall
never
*NL*
fail
to
put
their
mark
upon
it
,
that
it
may
be
at
all
times
ready
to
*NL*
be
restored
to
the
right
owner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
omission
of
this
was
highly
blameable
in
one
Mr
Moore
,
who
,
having
*NL*
formerly
borrowed
some
lines
of
Pope
and
company
,
took
the
liberty
to
*NL*
transcribe
six
of
them
into
his
play
of
the
Rival
Modes
.
Mr
Pope
,
*NL*
however
,
very
luckily
found
them
in
the
said
play
,
and
,
laying
violent
*NL*
hands
on
his
own
property
,
transferred
it
back
again
into
his
own
*NL*
works
;
and
,
for
a
further
punishment
,
imprisoned
the
said
Moore
in
the
*NL*
loathsome
dungeon
of
the
Dunciad
,
where
his
unhappy
memory
now
*NL*
remains
,
and
eternally
will
remain
,
as
a
proper
punishment
for
such
*NL*
his
unjust
dealings
in
the
poetical
trade
.

In

,
though
the

doth

found
which
puts
an
end
to

The
history
now
returns
to
the
inn
at
Upton
,
whence
we
shall
first
*NL*
trace
the
footsteps
of
Squire
Western
;
for
,
as
he
will
soon
arrive
at
*NL*
an
end
of
his
journey
,
we
shall
have
then
full
leisure
to
attend
our
*NL*
heroe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
be
pleased
to
remember
that
the
said
squire
departed
*NL*
from
the
inn
in
great
fury
,
and
in
that
fury
he
pursued
his
daughter
.
*NL*
The
hostler
having
informed
him
that
she
had
crossed
the
Severn
,
he
*NL*
likewise
past
that
river
with
his
equipage
,
and
rode
full
speed
,
*NL*
vowing
the
utmost
vengeance
against
poor
Sophia
,
if
he
should
but
*NL*
overtake
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
gone
far
before
he
arrived
at
a
crossway
.
Here
he
called
a
*NL*
short
council
of
war
,
in
which
,
after
hearing
different
opinions
,
he
*NL*
at
last
gave
the
direction
of
his
pursuit
to
fortune
,
and
struck
*NL*
directly
into
the
Worcester
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
road
he
proceeded
about
two
miles
,
when
he
began
to
bemoan
*NL*
himself
most
bitterly
,
frequently
crying
out
,
``
What
pity
is
it
!
Sure
*NL*
never
was
so
unlucky
a
dog
as
myself
!
''
And
then
burst
forth
a
volley
*NL*
of
oaths
and
execrations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parson
attempted
to
administer
comfort
to
him
on
this
occasion
.
*NL*
``
Sorrow
not
,
sir
,
''
says
he
,
``
like
those
without
hope
.
Howbeit
we
have
*NL*
not
yet
been
able
to
overtake
young
madam
,
we
may
account
it
some
good
*NL*
fortune
that
we
have
hitherto
traced
her
course
aright
.
Peradventure
*NL*
she
will
soon
be
fatigated
with
her
journey
,
and
will
tarry
in
some
*NL*
inn
,
in
order
to
renovate
her
corporeal
functions
;
and
in
that
case
,
*NL*
in
all
moral
certainty
,
you
will
very
briefly
be
_
compos
voti
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pogh
!
d
--
n
the
slut
!
''
answered
the
squire
,
``
I
am
lamenting
the
loss
*NL*
of
so
fine
a
morning
for
hunting
.
It
is
confounded
hard
to
lose
one
of
*NL*
the
best
scenting
days
,
in
all
appearance
,
which
hath
been
this
*NL*
season
,
and
especially
after
so
long
a
frost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Fortune
,
who
now
and
then
shows
some
compassion
in
her
*NL*
wantonest
tricks
,
might
not
take
pity
of
the
squire
;
and
,
as
she
had
*NL*
determined
not
to
let
him
overtake
his
daughter
,
might
not
resolve
to
*NL*
make
him
amends
some
other
way
,
I
will
not
assert
;
but
he
had
hardly
*NL*
uttered
the
words
just
before
commemorated
,
and
two
or
three
oaths
at
*NL*
their
heels
,
when
a
pack
of
hounds
began
to
open
their
melodious
*NL*
throats
at
a
small
distance
from
them
,
which
the
squire
's
horse
and
*NL*
his
rider
both
perceiving
,
both
immediately
pricked
up
their
ears
,
and
*NL*
the
squire
,
crying
,
``
She
's
gone
,
she
's
gone
!
Damn
me
if
she
is
not
*NL*
gone
!
''
instantly
clapped
spurs
to
the
beast
,
who
little
needed
it
,
*NL*
having
indeed
the
same
inclination
with
his
master
;
and
now
the
whole
*NL*
company
,
crossing
into
a
corn-field
,
rode
directly
towards
the
hounds
,
*NL*
with
much
hallowing
and
whooping
,
while
the
poor
parson
,
blessing
*NL*
himself
,
brought
up
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
fable
reports
that
the
fair
Grimalkin
,
whom
Venus
,
at
the
desire
*NL*
of
a
passionate
lover
,
converted
from
a
cat
into
a
fine
woman
,
no
*NL*
sooner
perceived
a
mouse
than
,
mindful
of
her
former
sport
,
and
still
*NL*
retaining
her
pristine
nature
,
she
leaped
from
the
bed
of
her
husband
*NL*
to
pursue
the
little
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
are
we
to
understand
by
this
?
Not
that
the
bride
was
displeased
*NL*
with
the
embraces
of
her
amorous
bridegroom
;
for
,
though
some
have
*NL*
remarked
that
cats
are
subject
to
ingratitude
,
yet
women
and
cats
too
*NL*
will
be
pleased
and
purr
on
certain
occasions
.
The
truth
is
,
as
the
*NL*
sagacious
Sir
Roger
L'Estrange
observes
,
in
his
deep
reflections
,
*NL*
that
,
``
if
we
shut
Nature
out
at
the
door
,
she
will
come
in
at
the
*NL*
window
;
and
that
puss
,
though
a
madam
,
will
be
a
mouser
still
.
''
In
the
*NL*
same
manner
we
are
not
to
arraign
the
squire
of
any
want
of
love
for
*NL*
his
daughter
;
for
in
reality
he
had
a
great
deal
;
we
are
only
to
*NL*
consider
that
he
was
a
squire
and
a
sportsman
,
and
then
we
may
apply
*NL*
the
fable
to
him
,
and
the
judicious
reflections
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hounds
ran
very
hard
,
as
it
is
called
,
and
the
squire
pursued
over
*NL*
hedge
and
ditch
,
with
all
his
usual
vociferation
and
alacrity
,
and
*NL*
with
all
his
usual
pleasure
;
nor
did
the
thoughts
of
Sophia
ever
once
*NL*
intrude
themselves
to
allay
the
satisfaction
he
enjoyed
in
the
chace
,
*NL*
which
,
he
said
,
was
one
of
the
finest
he
ever
saw
,
and
which
he
swore
*NL*
was
very
well
worth
going
fifty
miles
for
.
As
the
squire
forgot
his
*NL*
daughter
,
the
servants
,
we
may
easily
believe
,
forgot
their
mistress
;
*NL*
and
the
parson
,
after
having
expressed
much
astonishment
,
in
Latin
,
to
*NL*
himself
,
at
length
likewise
abandoned
all
farther
thoughts
of
the
*NL*
young
lady
,
and
,
jogging
on
at
a
distance
behind
,
began
to
meditate
a
*NL*
portion
of
doctrine
for
the
ensuing
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
who
owned
the
hounds
was
highly
pleased
with
the
arrival
of
*NL*
his
brother
squire
and
sportsman
;
for
all
men
approve
merit
in
their
*NL*
own
way
,
and
no
man
was
more
expert
in
the
field
than
Mr
Western
,
nor
*NL*
did
any
other
better
know
how
to
encourage
the
dogs
with
his
voice
,
*NL*
and
to
animate
the
hunt
with
his
holla
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sportsmen
,
in
the
warmth
of
a
chace
,
are
too
much
engaged
to
attend
to
*NL*
any
manner
of
ceremony
,
nay
,
even
to
the
offices
of
humanity
:
for
,
if
*NL*
any
of
them
meet
with
an
accident
by
tumbling
into
a
ditch
,
or
into
a
*NL*
river
,
the
rest
pass
on
regardless
,
and
generally
leave
him
to
his
*NL*
fate
:
during
this
time
,
therefore
,
the
two
squires
,
though
often
close
*NL*
to
each
other
,
interchanged
not
a
single
word
.
The
master
of
the
hunt
,
*NL*
however
,
often
saw
and
approved
the
great
judgment
of
the
stranger
in
*NL*
drawing
the
dogs
when
they
were
at
a
fault
,
and
hence
conceived
a
very
*NL*
high
opinion
of
his
understanding
,
as
the
number
of
his
attendants
*NL*
inspired
no
small
reverence
to
his
quality
.
As
soon
,
therefore
,
as
the
*NL*
sport
was
ended
by
the
death
of
the
little
animal
which
had
occasioned
*NL*
it
,
the
two
squires
met
,
and
in
all
squire-like
greeting
saluted
each
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
was
entertaining
enough
,
and
what
we
may
perhaps
*NL*
relate
in
an
appendix
,
or
on
some
other
occasion
;
but
as
it
nowise
*NL*
concerns
this
history
,
we
can
not
prevail
on
ourselves
to
give
it
a
*NL*
place
here
.
It
concluded
with
a
second
chace
,
and
that
with
an
*NL*
invitation
to
dinner
.
This
being
accepted
,
was
followed
by
a
hearty
*NL*
bout
of
drinking
,
which
ended
in
as
hearty
a
nap
on
the
part
of
Squire
*NL*
Western
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
squire
was
by
no
means
a
match
either
for
his
host
,
or
for
parson
*NL*
Supple
,
at
his
cups
that
evening
;
for
which
the
violent
fatigue
of
*NL*
mind
as
well
as
body
that
he
had
undergone
,
may
very
well
account
,
*NL*
without
the
least
derogation
from
his
honour
.
He
was
indeed
,
according
*NL*
to
the
vulgar
phrase
,
whistle
drunk
;
for
before
he
had
swallowed
the
*NL*
third
bottle
,
he
became
so
entirely
overpowered
that
though
he
was
not
*NL*
carried
off
to
bed
till
long
after
,
the
parson
considered
him
as
*NL*
absent
,
and
having
acquainted
the
other
squire
with
all
relating
to
*NL*
Sophia
,
he
obtained
his
promise
of
seconding
those
arguments
which
he
*NL*
intended
to
urge
the
next
morning
for
Mr
Western
's
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
,
therefore
,
had
the
good
squire
shaken
off
his
evening
,
and
*NL*
began
to
call
for
his
morning
draught
,
and
to
summon
his
horses
in
*NL*
order
to
renew
his
pursuit
,
than
Mr
Supple
began
his
dissuasives
,
*NL*
which
the
host
so
strongly
seconded
,
that
they
at
length
prevailed
,
*NL*
and
Mr
Western
agreed
to
return
home
;
being
principally
moved
by
one
*NL*
argument
,
viz.
,
that
he
knew
not
which
way
to
go
,
and
might
probably
*NL*
be
riding
farther
from
his
daughter
instead
of
towards
her
.
He
then
*NL*
took
leave
of
his
brother
sportsman
,
and
expressing
great
joy
that
the
*NL*
frost
was
broken
-LRB-
which
might
perhaps
be
no
small
motive
to
his
*NL*
hastening
home
-RRB-
,
set
forwards
,
or
rather
backwards
,
for
Somersetshire
;
*NL*
but
not
before
he
had
first
despatched
part
of
his
retinue
in
quest
of
*NL*
his
daughter
,
after
whom
he
likewise
sent
a
volley
of
the
most
bitter
*NL*
execrations
which
he
could
invent
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
departure
of
Jones
from
Upton
,
with
what
passed
between
him
and
*NL*
Partridge
on
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
we
are
once
more
come
to
our
heroe
;
and
,
to
say
truth
,
we
*NL*
have
been
obliged
to
part
with
him
so
long
,
that
,
considering
the
*NL*
condition
in
which
we
left
him
,
I
apprehend
many
of
our
readers
have
*NL*
concluded
we
intended
to
abandon
him
for
ever
;
he
being
at
present
in
*NL*
that
situation
in
which
prudent
people
usually
desist
from
enquiring
*NL*
any
farther
after
their
friends
,
lest
they
should
be
shocked
by
*NL*
hearing
such
friends
had
hanged
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
reality
,
if
we
have
not
all
the
virtues
,
I
will
boldly
say
,
*NL*
neither
have
we
all
the
vices
of
a
prudent
character
;
and
though
it
is
*NL*
not
easy
to
conceive
circumstances
much
more
miserable
than
those
of
*NL*
poor
Jones
at
present
,
we
shall
return
to
him
,
and
attend
upon
him
*NL*
with
the
same
diligence
as
if
he
was
wantoning
in
the
brightest
beams
*NL*
of
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
,
then
,
and
his
companion
Partridge
,
left
the
inn
a
few
*NL*
minutes
after
the
departure
of
Squire
Western
,
and
pursued
the
same
*NL*
road
on
foot
,
for
the
hostler
told
them
that
no
horses
were
by
any
*NL*
means
to
be
at
that
time
procured
at
Upton
.
On
they
marched
with
heavy
*NL*
hearts
;
for
though
their
disquiet
proceeded
from
very
different
*NL*
reasons
,
yet
displeased
they
were
both
;
and
if
Jones
sighed
bitterly
,
*NL*
Partridge
grunted
altogether
as
sadly
at
every
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
came
to
the
cross-roads
where
the
squire
had
stopt
to
take
*NL*
counsel
,
Jones
stopt
likewise
,
and
turning
to
Partridge
,
asked
his
*NL*
opinion
which
track
they
should
pursue
.
``
Ah
,
sir
,
''
answered
Partridge
,
*NL*
``
I
wish
your
honour
would
follow
my
advice
.
''
``
Why
should
I
not
?
''
*NL*
replied
Jones
;
``
for
it
is
now
indifferent
to
me
whither
I
go
,
or
what
*NL*
becomes
of
me
.
''
``
My
advice
,
then
,
''
said
Partridge
,
``
is
,
that
you
*NL*
immediately
face
about
and
return
home
;
for
who
that
hath
such
a
home
*NL*
to
return
to
as
your
honour
,
would
travel
thus
about
the
country
like
*NL*
a
vagabond
?
I
ask
pardon
,
_
sed
vox
ea
sola
reperta
est
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
cries
Jones
,
``
I
have
no
home
to
return
to
;
--
but
if
my
friend
,
*NL*
my
father
,
would
receive
me
,
could
I
bear
the
country
from
which
*NL*
Sophia
is
flown
?
Cruel
Sophia
!
Cruel
!
No
;
let
me
blame
myself
!
--
No
;
*NL*
let
me
blame
thee
.
D
--
nation
seize
thee
--
fool
--
blockhead
!
thou
hast
*NL*
undone
me
,
and
I
will
tear
thy
soul
from
thy
body
.
''
--
At
which
words
he
*NL*
laid
violent
hands
on
the
collar
of
poor
Partridge
,
and
shook
him
more
*NL*
heartily
than
an
ague-fit
,
or
his
own
fears
had
ever
done
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
fell
trembling
on
his
knees
,
and
begged
for
mercy
,
vowing
he
*NL*
had
meant
no
harm
--
when
Jones
,
after
staring
wildly
on
him
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
quitted
his
hold
,
and
discharged
a
rage
on
himself
,
that
,
had
*NL*
it
fallen
on
the
other
,
would
certainly
have
put
an
end
to
his
being
,
*NL*
which
indeed
the
very
apprehension
of
it
had
almost
effected
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
would
bestow
some
pains
here
in
minutely
describing
all
the
mad
*NL*
pranks
which
Jones
played
on
this
occasion
,
could
we
be
well
assured
*NL*
that
the
reader
would
take
the
same
pains
in
perusing
them
;
but
as
we
*NL*
are
apprehensive
that
,
after
all
the
labour
which
we
should
employ
in
*NL*
painting
this
scene
,
the
said
reader
would
be
very
apt
to
skip
it
*NL*
entirely
over
,
we
have
saved
ourselves
that
trouble
.
To
say
the
truth
,
*NL*
we
have
,
from
this
reason
alone
,
often
done
great
violence
to
the
*NL*
luxuriance
of
our
genius
,
and
have
left
many
excellent
descriptions
*NL*
out
of
our
work
,
which
would
otherwise
have
been
in
it
.
And
this
*NL*
suspicion
,
to
be
honest
,
arises
,
as
is
generally
the
case
,
from
our
*NL*
own
wicked
heart
;
for
we
have
,
ourselves
,
been
very
often
most
*NL*
horridly
given
to
jumping
,
as
we
have
run
through
the
pages
of
*NL*
voluminous
historians
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suffice
it
then
simply
to
say
,
that
Jones
,
after
having
played
the
*NL*
part
of
a
madman
for
many
minutes
,
came
,
by
degrees
,
to
himself
;
which
*NL*
no
sooner
happened
,
than
,
turning
to
Partridge
,
he
very
earnestly
*NL*
begged
his
pardon
for
the
attack
he
had
made
on
him
in
the
violence
of
*NL*
his
passion
;
but
concluded
,
by
desiring
him
never
to
mention
his
*NL*
return
again
;
for
he
was
resolved
never
to
see
that
country
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
easily
forgave
,
and
faithfully
promised
to
obey
the
*NL*
injunction
now
laid
upon
him
.
And
then
Jones
very
briskly
cried
out
,
*NL*
``
Since
it
is
absolutely
impossible
for
me
to
pursue
any
farther
the
*NL*
steps
of
my
angel
--
I
will
pursue
those
of
glory
.
Come
on
,
my
brave
*NL*
lad
,
now
for
the
army
:
--
it
is
a
glorious
cause
,
and
I
would
willingly
*NL*
sacrifice
my
life
in
it
,
even
though
it
was
worth
my
preserving
.
''
And
*NL*
so
saying
,
he
immediately
struck
into
the
different
road
from
that
*NL*
which
the
squire
had
taken
,
and
,
by
mere
chance
,
pursued
the
very
same
*NL*
through
which
Sophia
had
before
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
travellers
now
marched
a
full
mile
,
without
speaking
a
syllable
to
*NL*
each
other
,
though
Jones
,
indeed
,
muttered
many
things
to
himself
.
As
*NL*
to
Partridge
,
he
was
profoundly
silent
;
for
he
was
not
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
perfectly
recovered
from
his
former
fright
;
besides
,
he
had
*NL*
apprehensions
of
provoking
his
friend
to
a
second
fit
of
wrath
,
*NL*
especially
as
he
now
began
to
entertain
a
conceit
,
which
may
not
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
create
any
great
wonder
in
the
reader
.
In
short
,
he
began
now
*NL*
to
suspect
that
Jones
was
absolutely
out
of
his
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
Jones
,
being
weary
of
soliloquy
,
addressed
himself
to
his
*NL*
companion
,
and
blamed
him
for
his
taciturnity
;
for
which
the
poor
man
*NL*
very
honestly
accounted
,
from
his
fear
of
giving
offence
.
And
now
this
*NL*
fear
being
pretty
well
removed
,
by
the
most
absolute
promises
of
*NL*
indemnity
,
Partridge
again
took
the
bridle
from
his
tongue
;
which
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
rejoiced
no
less
at
regaining
its
liberty
,
than
a
young
colt
,
*NL*
when
the
bridle
is
slipt
from
his
neck
,
and
he
is
turned
loose
into
*NL*
the
pastures
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Partridge
was
inhibited
from
that
topic
which
would
have
first
*NL*
suggested
itself
,
he
fell
upon
that
which
was
next
uppermost
in
his
*NL*
mind
,
namely
,
the
Man
of
the
Hill
.
``
Certainly
,
sir
,
''
says
he
,
``
that
*NL*
could
never
be
a
man
,
who
dresses
himself
and
lives
after
such
a
*NL*
strange
manner
,
and
so
unlike
other
folks
.
Besides
,
his
diet
,
as
the
*NL*
old
woman
told
me
,
is
chiefly
upon
herbs
,
which
is
a
fitter
food
for
a
*NL*
horse
than
a
Christian
:
nay
,
landlord
at
Upton
says
that
the
*NL*
neighbours
thereabouts
have
very
fearful
notions
about
him
.
It
runs
*NL*
strangely
in
my
head
that
it
must
have
been
some
spirit
,
who
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
might
be
sent
to
forewarn
us
:
and
who
knows
but
all
that
matter
which
*NL*
he
told
us
,
of
his
going
to
fight
,
and
of
his
being
taken
prisoner
,
*NL*
and
of
the
great
danger
he
was
in
of
being
hanged
,
might
be
intended
*NL*
as
a
warning
to
us
,
considering
what
we
are
going
about
?
besides
,
I
*NL*
dreamt
of
nothing
all
last
night
but
of
fighting
;
and
methought
the
*NL*
blood
ran
out
of
my
nose
,
as
liquor
out
of
a
tap
.
Indeed
,
sir
,
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
story
,
Partridge
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
is
almost
as
ill
applied
as
*NL*
thy
Latin
.
Nothing
can
be
more
likely
to
happen
than
death
to
men
who
*NL*
go
into
battle
.
Perhaps
we
shall
both
fall
in
it
--
and
what
then
?
''
*NL*
``
What
then
?
''
replied
Partridge
;
``
why
then
there
is
an
end
of
us
,
is
*NL*
there
not
?
when
I
am
gone
,
all
is
over
with
me
.
What
matters
the
cause
*NL*
to
me
,
or
who
gets
the
victory
,
if
I
am
killed
?
I
shall
never
enjoy
*NL*
any
advantage
from
it
.
What
are
all
the
ringing
of
bells
,
and
*NL*
bonfires
,
to
one
that
is
six
foot
under
ground

there
will
be
an

``
And
an
end

cries
Jones
,
*NL*
``
there
must
be

one
time

other

them
,
''
cries
Partridge
;
``
for
Horace
is
a
*NL*
hard
author
,
and
I
can
not
understand
as
you
repeat
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
repeat
you
a
bad
imitation
,
or
rather
paraphrase
,
of
my
own
,
''
*NL*
said
Jones
;
``
for
I
am
but
an
indifferent
poet
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
would
not
die
in
his
dear
country
's
cause
?
Since
,
if
base
fear
*NL*
his
dastard
step
withdraws
,
From
death
he
can
not
fly
:
--
One
common
*NL*
grave
Receives
,
at
last
,
the
coward
and
the
brave
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
certain
,
''
cries
Partridge
.
``
Ay
,
sure
,
_
Mors
omnibus
*NL*
communis
:
_
but
there
is
a
great
difference
between
dying
in
one
's
bed
*NL*
a
great
many
years
hence
,
like
a
good
Christian
,
with
all
our
friends
*NL*
crying
about
us
,
and
being
shot
to-day
or
to-morrow
,
like
a
mad
dog
;
*NL*
or
,
perhaps
,
hacked
in
twenty
pieces
with
the
sword
,
and
that
too
*NL*
before
we
have
repented
of
all
our
sins
.
O
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
us
!
*NL*
to
be
sure
the
soldiers
are
a
wicked
kind
of
people
.
I
never
loved
to
*NL*
have
anything
to
do
with
them
.
I
could
hardly
bring
myself
ever
to
*NL*
look
upon
them
as
Christians
.
There
is
nothing
but
cursing
and
*NL*
swearing
among
them
.
I
wish
your
honour
would
repent
:
I
heartily
wish
*NL*
you
would
repent
before
it
is
too
late
;
and
not
think
of
going
among
*NL*
them
.
--
Evil
communication
corrupts
good
manners
.
That
is
my
principal
*NL*
reason
.
For
as
for
that
matter
,
I
am
no
more
afraid
than
another
man
,
*NL*
not
I
;
as
to
matter
of
that
.
I
know
all
human
flesh
must
die
;
but
yet
*NL*
a
man
may
live
many
years
,
for
all
that
.
Why
,
I
am
a
middle-aged
man
*NL*
now
,
and
yet
I
may
live
a
great
number
of
years
.
I
have
read
of
*NL*
several
who
have
lived
to
be
above
a
hundred
,
and
some
a
great
deal
*NL*
above
a
hundred
.
Not
that
I
hope
,
I
mean
that
I
promise
myself
,
to
*NL*
live
to
any
such
age
as
that
,
neither
.
--
But
if
it
be
only
to
eighty
or
*NL*
ninety
.
Heaven
be
praised
,
that
is
a
great
ways
off
yet
;
and
I
am
not
*NL*
afraid
of
dying
then
,
no
more
than
another
man
;
but
,
surely
,
to
tempt
*NL*
death
before
a
man
's
time
is
come
seems
to
me
downright
wickedness
and
*NL*
presumption
.
Besides
,
if
it
was
to
do
any
good
indeed
;
but
,
let
the
*NL*
cause
be
what
it
will
,
what
mighty
matter
of
good
can
two
people
do
?
*NL*
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
understand
nothing
of
it
.
I
never
fired
off
a
gun
*NL*
above
ten
times
in
my
life
;
and
then
it
was
not
charged
with
bullets
.
*NL*
And
for
the
sword
,
I
never
learned
to
fence
,
and
know
nothing
of
the
*NL*
matter
.
And
then
there
are
those
cannons
,
which
certainly
it
must
be
*NL*
thought
the
highest
presumption
to
go
in
the
way
of
;
and
nobody
but
a
*NL*
madman
--
I
ask
pardon
;
upon
my
soul
I
meant
no
harm
;
I
beg
I
may
not
*NL*
throw
your
honour
into
another
passion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
under
no
apprehension

Partridge
,
''
cries
Jones
;
``
I
am
now
so
well
*NL*
convinced
of
thy
cowardice
,
that
thou
couldst
not
provoke
me
on
any
*NL*
account
.
''
``
Your
honour
,
''
answered
he
,
``
may
call
me
coward
,
or
anything
*NL*
else
you
please

If
loving

a

Not
a

of
*NL*
fighting
;
and
I
am
sure
the
scripture
is
so
much
against
it
,
that
a
*NL*
man
shall
never
persuade
me
he
is
a
good
Christian
while
he
sheds

*NL*
Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adventure
of
a
beggar-man
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
Partridge
had
uttered
that
good
and
pious
doctrine
,
with
which
*NL*
the
last
chapter
concluded
,
they
arrived
at
another
cross-way
,
when
a
*NL*
lame
fellow
in
rags
asked
them
for
alms
;
upon
which
Partridge
gave
him
*NL*
a
severe
rebuke
,
saying
,
``
Every
parish
ought
to
keep
their
own
poor
.
''
*NL*
Jones
then
fell
a-laughing
,
and
asked
Partridge
,
``
if
he
was
not
*NL*
ashamed
,
with
so
much
charity
in
his
mouth
,
to
have
no
charity
in
his
*NL*
heart
.
Your
religion
,
''
says
he
,
``
serves
you
only
for
an
excuse
for
*NL*
your
faults
,
but
is
no
incentive
to
your
virtue
.
Can
any
man
who
is
*NL*
really
a
Christian
abstain
from
relieving
one
of
his
brethren
in
such
*NL*
a
miserable
condition
?
''
And
at
the
same
time
,
putting
his
hand
in
his
*NL*
pocket
,
he
gave
the
poor
object
a
shilling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
,
''
cries
the
fellow
,
after
thanking
him
,
``
I
have
a
curious
*NL*
thing
here
in
my
pocket
,
which
I
found
about
two
miles
off
,
if
your
*NL*
worship
will
please
to
buy
it
.
I
should
not
venture
to
pull
it
out
to
*NL*
every
one
;
but
,
as
you
are
so
good
a
gentleman
,
and
so
kind
to
the
*NL*
poor
,
you
wo
n't
suspect
a
man
of
being
a
thief
only
because
he
is
*NL*
poor
.
''
He
then
pulled
out
a
little
gilt
pocket-book
,
and
delivered
it
*NL*
into
the
hands
of
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
presently
opened
it
,
and
-LRB-
guess
,
reader
,
what
he
felt
-RRB-
saw
in
*NL*
the
first
page
the
words
Sophia
Western
,
written
by
her
own
fair
hand
.
*NL*
He
no
sooner
read
the
name
than
he
prest
it
close
to
his
lips
;
nor
*NL*
could
he
avoid
falling
into
some
very
frantic
raptures
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
his
company
;
but
,
perhaps
,
these
very
raptures
made
*NL*
him
forget
he
was
not
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Jones
was
kissing
and
mumbling
the
book
,
as
if
he
had
an
*NL*
excellent
brown
buttered
crust
in
his
mouth
or
as
if
he
had
really
*NL*
been
a
book-worm
,
or
an
author
who
had
nothing
to
eat
but
his
own
*NL*
works
,
a
piece
of
paper
fell
from
its
leaves
to
the
ground
,
which
*NL*
Partridge
took
up
,
and
delivered
to
Jones
,
who
presently
perceived
it
*NL*
to
be
a
bank-bill
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
the
very
bill
which
Western
had
*NL*
given
his
daughter
the
night
before
her
departure
;
and
a
Jew
would
*NL*
have
jumped
to
purchase
it
at
five
shillings
less
than
L100
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eyes
of
Partridge
sparkled
at
this
news
,
which
Jones
now
*NL*
proclaimed
aloud
;
and
so
did
-LRB-
though
with
somewhat
a
different
aspect
-RRB-
*NL*
those
of
the
poor
fellow
who
had
found
the
book
;
and
who
-LRB-
I
hope
from
*NL*
a
principle
of
honesty
-RRB-
had
never
opened
it
:
but
we
should
not
deal
*NL*
honestly
by
the
reader
if
we
omitted
to
inform
him
of
a
circumstance
*NL*
which
may
be
here
a
little
material
,
viz
.
that
the
fellow
could
not
*NL*
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
who
had
felt
nothing
but
pure
joy
and
transport
from
the
*NL*
finding
the
book
,
was
affected
with
a
mixture
of
concern
at
this
new
*NL*
discovery
;
for
his
imagination
instantly
suggested
to
him
that
the
*NL*
owner
of
the
bill
might
possibly
want
it
before
he
should
be
able
to
*NL*
convey
it
to
her
.
He
then
acquainted
the
finder
that
he
knew
the
lady
*NL*
to
whom
the
book
belonged
,
and
would
endeavour
to
find
her
out
as
soon
*NL*
as
possible
,
and
return
it
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pocket-book
was
a
late
present
from
Mrs
Western
to
her
niece
;
it
*NL*
had
cost
five-and-twenty
shillings
,
having
been
bought
of
a
celebrated
*NL*
toyman
;
but
the
real
value
of
the
silver
which
it
contained
in
its
*NL*
clasp
was
about
eighteen-pence
;
and
that
price
the
said
toyman
,
as
it
*NL*
was
altogether
as
good
as
when
it
first
issued
from
his
shop
,
would
*NL*
now
have
given
for
it
.
A
prudent
person
would
,
however
,
have
taken
*NL*
proper
advantage
of
the
ignorance
of
this
fellow
,
and
would
not
have
*NL*
offered
more
than
a
shilling
,
or
perhaps
sixpence
,
for
it
;
nay
,
some
*NL*
perhaps
would
have
given
nothing
,
and
left
the
fellow
to
his
action
of
*NL*
trover
,
which
some
learned
serjeants
may
doubt
whether
he
could
,
under
*NL*
these
circumstances
,
have
maintained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
on
the
contrary
,
whose
character
was
on
the
outside
of
*NL*
generosity
,
and
may
perhaps
not
very
unjustly
have
been
suspected
of
*NL*
extravagance
,
without
any
hesitation
gave
a
guinea
in
exchange
for
the
*NL*
book
.
The
poor
man
,
who
had
not
for
a
long
time
before
been
possessed
*NL*
of
so
much
treasure
,
gave
Mr
Jones
a
thousand
thanks
,
and
discovered
*NL*
little
less
of
transport
in
his
muscles
than
Jones
had
before
shown
*NL*
when
he
had
first
read
the
name
of
Sophia
Western
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fellow
very
readily
agreed
to
attend
our
travellers
to
the
place
*NL*
where
he
had
found
the
pocket-book
.
Together
,
therefore
,
they
*NL*
proceeded
directly
thither
;
but
not
so
fast
as
Mr
Jones
desired
;
for
*NL*
his
guide
unfortunately
happened
to
be
lame
,
and
could
not
possibly
*NL*
travel
faster
than
a
mile
an
hour
.
As
this
place
,
therefore
,
was
at
*NL*
above
three
miles
'
distance
,
though
the
fellow
had
said
otherwise
,
the
*NL*
reader
need
not
be
acquainted
how
long
they
were
in
walking
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
opened
the
book
a
hundred
times
during
their
walk
,
kissed
it
as
*NL*
often
,
talked
much
to
himself
,
and
very
little
to
his
companions
.
At
*NL*
all
which
the
guide
exprest
some
signs
of
astonishment
to
Partridge
;
*NL*
who
more
than
once
shook
his
head
,
and
cryed
,
Poor
gentleman
!
_
orandum
*NL*
est
ut
sit
mens
sana
in
corpore
sano
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
they
arrived
at
the
very
spot
where
Sophia
unhappily
dropt
*NL*
the
pocket-book
,
and
where
the
fellow
had
as
happily
found
it
.
Here
*NL*
Jones
offered
to
take
leave
of
his
guide
,
and
to
improve
his
pace
;
but
*NL*
the
fellow
,
in
whom
that
violent
surprize
and
joy
which
the
first
*NL*
receipt
of
the
guinea
had
occasioned
was
now
considerably
abated
,
and
*NL*
who
had
now
had
sufficient
time
to
recollect
himself
,
put
on
a
*NL*
discontented
look
,
and
,
scratching
his
head
,
said
,
``
He
hoped
his
*NL*
worship
would
give
him
something
more
.
Your
worship
,
''
said
he
,
``
will
,
*NL*
I
hope
,
take
it
into
your
consideration
that
if
I
had
not
been
honest
*NL*
I
might
have
kept
the
whole
.
''
And
,
indeed
,
this
the
reader
must
*NL*
confess
to
have
been
true
.
``
If
the
paper
there
,
''
said
he
,
``
be
worth
*NL*
L100
,
I
am
sure
the
finding
it
deserves
more
than
a
guinea
.
Besides
,
*NL*
suppose
your
worship
should
never
see
the
lady
,
nor
give
it
her
--
and
,
*NL*
though
your
worship
looks
and
talks
very
much
like
a
gentleman
,
yet
I
*NL*
have
only
your
worship
's
bare
word
;
and
,
certainly
,
if
the
right
owner
*NL*
be
n't
to
be
found
,
it
all
belongs
to
the
first
finder
.
I
hope
your
*NL*
worship
will
consider
of
all
these
matters
:
I
am
but
a
poor
man
,
and
*NL*
therefore
do
n't
desire
to
have
all
;
but
it
is
but
reasonable
I
should
*NL*
have
my
share
.
Your
worship
looks
like
a
good
man
,
and
,
I
hope
,
will
*NL*
consider
my
honesty
;
for
I
might
have
kept
every
farthing
,
and
nobody
*NL*
ever
the
wiser
.
''
``
I
promise
thee
,
upon
my
honour
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
that
*NL*
I
know
the
right
owner
,
and
will
restore
it
her
.
''
``
Nay
,
your
worship

''
*NL*
answered
the
fellow
,
``
may
do
as
you
please
as
to
that
;
if
you
will
but
*NL*
give
me
my
share

one-half
of
the
money
,

honour
may
keep
*NL*
the
rest
yourself
if
you
please

''
and
concluded
with
swearing
,
by
a
*NL*
very
vehement
oath
,
``
that
he
would
never
mention
a
syllable
of
it
to
*NL*
any
man
living

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lookee

cries
Jones
,
``
the
right
owner
shall
certainly
have
*NL*
again
all
that
she
lost

as
for
any
farther
gratuity
,
I
really
*NL*
can
not
give
it
you
at
present
;
but
let
me
know
your
name
,
and
where
*NL*
you
live
,
and
it
is
more
than
possible
you
may
hereafter
have
further
*NL*
reason
to
rejoice
at
this
morning
's
adventure

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by

cries
the
fellow
;
``
it
seems
I

must
venture
whether
you
will
return
the
lady
her
money
or
no

but
I

hope
your
worship
will
consider

``
Come

said
Partridge
,
``
tell

I
warrant
you
will

into

''
The
fellow
,
seeing
*NL*
no
hopes
of
recovering
the
possession
of
the
pocket-book
,
at
last
*NL*
complied
in
giving
in
his
name
and
place
of
abode
,
which
Jones
writ
*NL*
upon
a
piece
of
paper
with
the
pencil
of
Sophia
;
and
then
,
placing
the
*NL*
paper
in
the
same
page
where
she
had
writ
her
name
,
he
cried
out
,
*NL*
``
There
,
friend
,
you
are
the
happiest
man
alive
;
I
have
joined
your
*NL*
name
to
that
of
an
angel
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
angels
,
''
*NL*
answered
the
fellow
;
``
but
I
wish
you
would
give
me
a
little
more
*NL*
money
,
or
else
return
me
the
pocket-book
.
''
Partridge
now
waxed
wrath
:
*NL*
he
called
the
poor
cripple
by
several
vile
and
opprobrious
names
,
and
*NL*
was
absolutely
proceeding
to
beat
him
,
but
Jones
would
not
suffer
any
*NL*
such
thing
:
and
now
,
telling
the
fellow
he
would
certainly
find
some
*NL*
opportunity
of
serving
him
,
Mr
Jones
departed
as
fast
as
his
heels
*NL*
would
carry
him
;
and
Partridge
,
into
whom
the
thoughts
of
the
hundred
*NL*
pound
had
infused
new
spirits
,
followed
his
leader
;
while
the
man
,
who
*NL*
was
obliged
to
stay
behind
,
fell
to
cursing
them
both
,
as
well
as
his
*NL*
parents
;
``
for
had
they
,
''
says
he
,
``
sent
me
to
charity-school
to
learn
*NL*
to
write
and
read
and
cast
accounts
,
I
should
have
known
the
value
of
*NL*
these
matters
as
well
as
other
people
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
v.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
more
adventures
which
Mr
Jones
and
his
companion
met
on
the
*NL*
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Our
travellers
now
walked
so
fast
,
that
they
had
very
little
time
or
*NL*
breath
for
conversation
;
Jones
meditating
all
the
way
on
Sophia
,
and
*NL*
Partridge
on
the
bank-bill
,
which
,
though
it
gave
him
some
pleasure
,
*NL*
caused
him
at
the
same
time
to
repine
at
fortune
,
which
,
in
all
his
*NL*
walks
,
had
never
given
him
such
an
opportunity
of
showing
his
honesty
.
*NL*
They
had
proceeded
above
three
miles
,
when
Partridge
,
being
unable
any
*NL*
longer
to
keep
up
with
Jones
,
called
to
him
,
and
begged
him
a
little
*NL*
to
slacken
his
pace
:
with
this
he
was
the
more
ready
to
comply
,
as
he
*NL*
had
for
some
time
lost
the
footsteps
of
the
horses
,
which
the
thaw
had
*NL*
enabled
him
to
trace
for
several
miles
,
and
he
was
now
upon
a
wide
*NL*
common
,
where
were
several
roads
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
here
therefore
stopt
to
consider
which
of
these
roads
he
should
*NL*
pursue
;
when
on
a
sudden
they
heard
the
noise
of
a
drum
,
that
seemed
*NL*
at
no
great
distance
.
This
sound
presently
alarmed
the
fears
of
*NL*
Partridge
,
and
he
cried
out
,
``
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
all
;
they
are
*NL*
certainly
a
coming
!
''
``
Who
is
coming
?
''
cries
Jones
;
for
fear
had
long
*NL*
since
given
place
to
softer
ideas
in
his
mind
;
and
since
his
adventure
*NL*
with
the
lame
man
,
he
had
been
totally
intent
on
pursuing
Sophia
,
*NL*
without
entertaining
one
thought
of
an
enemy
.
``
Who
?
''
cries
Partridge
,
*NL*
``
why
,
the
rebels
:
but
why
should
I
call
them
rebels
?
they
may
be
very
*NL*
honest
gentlemen
,
for
anything
I
know
to
the
contrary
.
The
devil
take
*NL*
him
that
affronts
them
,
I
say
;
I
am
sure
,
if
they
have
nothing
to
say
*NL*
to
me
,
I
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
,
but
in
a
civil
way
.
For
*NL*
Heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
do
n't
affront
them
if
they
should
come
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
they
may
do
us
no
harm
;
but
would
it
not
be
the
wiser
way
to
*NL*
creep
into
some
of
yonder
bushes
,
till
they
are
gone
by
?
What
can
two
*NL*
unarmed
men
do
perhaps
against
fifty
thousand
?
Certainly
nobody
but
a
*NL*
madman
;
I
hope
your
honour
is
not
offended
;
but
certainly
no
man
who
*NL*
hath
_
mens
sana
in
corpore
sano
_
--
''
Here
Jones
interrupted
this
*NL*
torrent
of
eloquence
,
which
fear
had
inspired
,
saying
,
``
That
by
the
*NL*
drum
he
perceived
they
were
near
some
town
.
''
He
then
made
directly
*NL*
towards
the
place
whence
the
noise
proceeded
,
bidding
Partridge
``
take
*NL*
courage
,
for
that
he
would
lead
him
into
no
danger
;
''
and
adding
,
``
it
*NL*
was
impossible
the
rebels
should
be
so
near
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
was
a
little
comforted
with
this
last
assurance
;
and
though
*NL*
he
would
more
gladly
have
gone
the
contrary
way
,
he
followed
his
*NL*
leader
,
his
heart
beating
time
,
but
not
after
the
manner
of
heroes
,
to
*NL*
the
music
of
the
drum
,
which
ceased
not
till
they
had
traversed
the
*NL*
common
,
and
were
come
into
a
narrow
lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
Partridge
,
who
kept
even
pace
with
Jones
,
discovered
something
*NL*
painted
flying
in
the
air
,
a
very
few
yards
before
him
,
which
fancying
*NL*
to
be
the
colours
of
the
enemy
,
he
fell
a
bellowing
,
``
Oh
Lord
,
sir
,
*NL*
here
they
are
;
there
is
the
crown
and
coffin
.
Oh
Lord
!
I
never
saw
*NL*
anything
so
terrible
;
and
we
are
within
gun-shot
of
them
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
no
sooner
looked
up
,
than
he
plainly
perceived
what
it
was
which
*NL*
Partridge
had
thus
mistaken
.
``
Partridge
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
fancy
you
will
*NL*
be
able
to
engage
this
whole
army
yourself
;
for
by
the
colours
I
guess
*NL*
what
the
drum
was
which
we
heard
before
,
and
which
beats
up
for
*NL*
recruits
to
a
puppet-show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
puppet-show
!
''
answered
Partridge
,
with
most
eager
transport
.
``
And
*NL*
is
it
really
no
more
than
that
?
I
love
a
puppet-show
of
all
the
*NL*
pastimes
upon
earth
.
Do
,
good
sir
,
let
us
tarry
and
see
it
.
Besides
,
I
*NL*
am
quite
famished
to
death
;
for
it
is
now
almost
dark
,
and
I
have
not
*NL*
eat
a
morsel
since
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
arrived
at
an
inn
,
or
indeed
an
ale-house
,
where
Jones
was
*NL*
prevailed
upon
to
stop
,
the
rather
as
he
had
no
longer
any
assurance
*NL*
of
being
in
the
road
he
desired
.
They
walked
both
directly
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
where
Jones
began
to
enquire
if
no
ladies
had
passed
that
way
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
and
Partridge
as
eagerly
examined
into
the
state
of
*NL*
their
provisions
;
and
indeed
his
enquiry
met
with
the
better
success
;
*NL*
for
Jones
could
not
hear
news
of
Sophia
;
but
Partridge
,
to
his
great
*NL*
satisfaction
,
found
good
reason
to
expect
very
shortly
the
agreeable
*NL*
sight
of
an
excellent
smoaking
dish
of
eggs
and
bacon
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
strong
and
healthy
constitutions
love
hath
a
very
different
effect
*NL*
from
what
it
causes
in
the
puny
part
of
the
species
.
In
the
latter
it
*NL*
generally
destroys
all
that
appetite
which
tends
towards
the
*NL*
conservation
of
the
individual
;
but
in
the
former
,
though
it
often
*NL*
induces
forgetfulness
,
and
a
neglect
of
food
,
as
well
as
of
everything
*NL*
else
;
yet
place
a
good
piece
of
well-powdered
buttock
before
a
hungry
*NL*
lover
,
and
he
seldom
fails
very
handsomely
to
play
his
part
.
Thus
it
*NL*
happened
in
the
present
case
;
for
though
Jones
perhaps
wanted
a
*NL*
prompter
,
and
might
have
travelled
much
farther
,
had
he
been
alone
,
*NL*
with
an
empty
stomach
;
yet
no
sooner
did
he
sit
down
to
the
bacon
and
*NL*
eggs
,
than
he
fell
to
as
heartily
and
voraciously
as
Partridge
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
our
travellers
had
finished
their
dinner
,
night
came
on
,
and
as
*NL*
the
moon
was
now
past
the
full
,
it
was
extremely
dark
.
Partridge
*NL*
therefore
prevailed
on
Jones
to
stay
and
see
the
puppet-show
,
which
*NL*
was
just
going
to
begin
,
and
to
which
they
were
very
eagerly
invited
*NL*
by
the
master
of
the
said
show
,
who
declared
that
his
figures
were
the
*NL*
finest
which
the
world
had
ever
produced
,
and
that
they
had
given
*NL*
great
satisfaction
to
all
the
quality
in
every
town
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
puppet-show
was
performed
with
great
regularity
and
decency
.
It
*NL*
was
called
the
fine
and
serious
part
of
the
Provoked
Husband
;
and
it
*NL*
was
indeed
a
very
grave
and
solemn
entertainment
,
without
any
low
wit
*NL*
or
humour
,
or
jests
;
or
,
to
do
it
no
more
than
justice
,
without
*NL*
anything
which
could
provoke
a
laugh
.
The
audience
were
all
highly
*NL*
pleased
.
A
grave
matron
told
the
master
she
would
bring
her
two
*NL*
daughters
the
next
night
,
as
he
did
not
show
any
stuff
;
and
an
*NL*
attorney
's
clerk
and
an
exciseman
both
declared
,
that
the
characters
*NL*
of
Lord
and
Lady
Townley
were
well
preserved
,
and
highly
in
nature
.
*NL*
Partridge
likewise
concurred
with
this
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
was
so
highly
elated
with
these
encomiums
,
that
he
could
*NL*
not
refrain
from
adding
some
more
of
his
own
.
He
said
,
``
The
present
*NL*
age
was
not
improved
in
anything
so
much
as
in
their
puppet-shows
;
*NL*
which
,
by
throwing
out
Punch
and
his
wife
Joan
,
and
such
idle
*NL*
trumpery
,
were
at
last
brought
to
be
a
rational
entertainment
.
I
*NL*
remember
,
''
said
he
,
``
when
I
first
took
to
the
business
,
there
was
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
low
stuff
that
did
very
well
to
make
folks
laugh
;
but
*NL*
was
never
calculated
to
improve
the
morals
of
young
people
,
which
*NL*
certainly
ought
to
be
principally
aimed
at
in
every
puppet-show
:
for
*NL*
why
may
not
good
and
instructive
lessons
be
conveyed
this
way
,
as
well
*NL*
as
any
other
?
My
figures
are
as
big
as
the
life
,
and
they
represent
*NL*
the
life
in
every
particular
;
and
I
question
not
but
people
rise
from
*NL*
my
little
drama
as
much
improved
as
they
do
from
the
great
.
''
``
I
would
*NL*
by
no
means
degrade
the
ingenuity
of
your
profession
,
''
answered
Jones
,
*NL*
``
but
I
should
have
been
glad
to
have
seen
my
old
acquaintance
master
*NL*
Punch
,
for
all
that
;
and
so
far
from
improving
,
I
think
,
by
leaving
*NL*
out
him
and
his
merry
wife
Joan
,
you
have
spoiled
your
puppet-show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dancer
of
wires
conceived
an
immediate
and
high
contempt
for
*NL*
Jones
,
from
these
words
.
And
with
much
disdain
in
his
countenance
,
he
*NL*
replied
,
``
Very
probably
,
sir
,
that
may
be
your
opinion
;
but
I
have
the
*NL*
satisfaction
to
know
the
best
judges
differ
from
you
,
and
it
is
*NL*
impossible
to
please
every
taste
.
I
confess
,
indeed
,
some
of
the
*NL*
quality
at
Bath
,
two
or
three
years
ago
,
wanted
mightily
to
bring
*NL*
Punch
again
upon
the
stage
.
I
believe
I
lost
some
money
for
not
*NL*
agreeing
to
it
;
but
let
others
do
as
they
will
;
a
little
matter
shall
*NL*
never
bribe
me
to
degrade
my
own
profession
,
nor
will
I
ever
willingly
*NL*
consent
to
the
spoiling
the
decency
and
regularity
of
my
stage
,
by
*NL*
introducing
any
such
low
stuff
upon
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
,
friend
,
''
cries
the
clerk
,
``
you
are
very
right
.
Always
avoid
*NL*
what
is
low
.
There
are
several
of
my
acquaintance
in
London
,
who
are
*NL*
resolved
to
drive
everything
which
is
low
from
the
stage
.
''
``
Nothing
*NL*
can
be
more
proper
,
''
cries
the
exciseman
,
pulling
his
pipe
from
his
*NL*
mouth
.
``
I
remember
,
''
added
he
,
''
-LRB-
for
I
then
lived
with
my
lord
-RRB-
I
was
*NL*
in
the
footman
's
gallery
,
the
night
when
this
play
of
the
Provoked
*NL*
Husband
was
acted
first
.
There
was
a
great
deal
of
low
stuff
in
it
*NL*
about
a
country
gentleman
come
up
to
town
to
stand
for
parliament-man
;
*NL*
and
there
they
brought
a
parcel
of
his
servants
upon
the
stage
,
his
*NL*
coachman
I
remember
particularly
;
but
the
gentlemen
in
our
gallery
*NL*
could
not
bear
anything
so
low
,
and
they
damned
it
.
I
observe
,
friend
,
*NL*
you
have
left
all
that
matter
out
,
and
you
are
to
be
commended
for
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
gentlemen
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
I
can
never
maintain
my
opinion
*NL*
against
so
many
;
indeed
,
if
the
generality
of
his
audience
dislike
*NL*
him
,
the
learned
gentleman
who
conducts
the
show
might
have
done
very
*NL*
right
in
dismissing
Punch
from
his
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
of
the
show
then
began
a
second
harangue
,
and
said
much
of
*NL*
the
great
force
of
example
,
and
how
much
the
inferior
part
of
mankind
*NL*
would
be
deterred
from
vice
,
by
observing
how
odious
it
was
in
their
*NL*
superiors
;
when
he
was
unluckily
interrupted
by
an
incident
,
which
,
*NL*
though
perhaps
we
might
have
omitted
it
at
another
time
,
we
can
not
*NL*
help
relating
at
present
,
but
not
in
this
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
which
it
may
be
inferred
that
the
best
things
are
liable
to
be
*NL*
misunderstood
and
misinterpreted
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
violent
uproar
now
arose
in
the
entry
,
where
my
landlady
was
well
*NL*
cuffing
her
maid
both
with
her
fist
and
tongue
.
She
had
indeed
missed
*NL*
the
wench
from
her
employment
,
and
,
after
a
little
search
,
had
found
*NL*
her
on
the
puppet-show
stage
in
company
with
the
Merry
Andrew
,
and
in
*NL*
a
situation
not
very
proper
to
be
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Grace
-LRB-
for
that
was
her
name
-RRB-
had
forfeited
all
title
to
*NL*
modesty
;
yet
had
she
not
impudence
enough
to
deny
a
fact
in
which
she
*NL*
was
actually
surprized
;
she
,
therefore
,
took
another
turn
,
and
*NL*
attempted
to
mitigate
the
offence

``
Why
do
you
beat
me
in
this
manner

*NL*
mistress
?
''
cries
the
wench
.
``
If
you
do

like
my
doings

away

-LRB-
for
the
other

liberally
bestowed
that
*NL*
appellation
on
her
-RRB-
,
``
my
betters
are
so
as
well
as
I

What
was
the
*NL*
fine
lady
in
the
puppet-show
just
now
?
I
suppose
she
did
not
lie
all
*NL*
night
out
from
her
husband
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
now
burst
into
the
kitchen
,
and
fell
foul
on
both
her
*NL*
husband
and
the
poor
puppet-mover
.
``
Here
,
husband
,
''
says
she
,
``
you
see
*NL*
the
consequence
of
harbouring
these
people
in
your
house
.
If
one
doth
*NL*
draw
a
little
drink
the
more
for
them
,
one
is
hardly
made
amends
for
*NL*
the
litter
they
make
;
and
then
to
have
one
's
house
made
a
bawdy-house
*NL*
of
by
such
lousy
vermin
.
In
short
,
I
desire
you
would
be
gone
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
;
for
I
will
tolerate
no
more
such
doings
.
It
is
only
*NL*
the
way
to
teach
our
servants
idleness
and
nonsense
;
for
to
be
sure
*NL*
nothing
better
can
be
learned
by
such
idle
shows
as
these
.
I
remember
*NL*
when
puppet-shows
were
made
of
good
scripture
stories
,
as
Jephthah
's
*NL*
Rash
Vow
,
and
such
good
things
,
and
when
wicked
people
were
carried
*NL*
away
by
the
devil
.
There
was
some
sense
in
those
matters
;
but
as
the
*NL*
parson
told
us
last
Sunday
,
nobody
believes
in
the
devil
now-a-days
;
*NL*
and
here
you
bring
about
a
parcel
of
puppets
drest
up
like
lords
and
*NL*
ladies
,
only
to
turn
the
heads
of
poor
country
wenches
;
and
when
their
*NL*
heads
are
once
turned
topsy-turvy
,
no
wonder
everything
else
is
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Virgil
,
I
think
,
tells
us
,
that
when
the
mob
are
assembled
in
a
*NL*
riotous
and
tumultuous
manner
,
and
all
sorts
of
missile
weapons
fly
*NL*
about
,
if
a
man
of
gravity
and
authority
appears
amongst
them
,
the
*NL*
tumult
is
presently
appeased
,
and
the
mob
,
which
when
collected
into
*NL*
one
body
,
may
be
well
compared
to
an
ass
,
erect
their
long
ears
at
the
*NL*
grave
man
's
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
contrary
,
when
a
set
of
grave
men
and
philosophers
are
*NL*
disputing
;
when
wisdom
herself
may
in
a
manner
be
considered
as
*NL*
present
,
and
administering
arguments
to
the
disputants
;
should
a
*NL*
tumult
arise
among
the
mob
,
or
should
one
scold
,
who
is
herself
equal
*NL*
in
noise
to
a
mighty
mob
,
appear
among
the
said
philosophers
;
their
*NL*
disputes
cease
in
a
moment
,
wisdom
no
longer
performs
her
ministerial
*NL*
office
,
and
the
attention
of
every
one
is
immediately
attracted
by
the
*NL*
scold
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
uproar
aforesaid
,
and
the
arrival
of
the
landlady
,
silenced
*NL*
the
master
of
the
puppet-show
,
and
put
a
speedy
and
final
end
to
that
*NL*
grave
and
solemn
harangue
,
of
which
we
have
given
the
reader
a
*NL*
sufficient
taste
already
.
Nothing
indeed
could
have
happened
so
very
*NL*
inopportune
as
this
accident
;
the
most
wanton
malice
of
fortune
could
*NL*
not
have
contrived
such
another
stratagem
to
confound
the
poor
fellow
,
*NL*
while
he
was
so
triumphantly
descanting
on
the
good
morals
inculcated
*NL*
by
his
exhibitions
.
His
mouth
was
now
as
effectually
stopt
,
as
that
of
*NL*
quack
must
be
,
if
,
in
the
midst
of
a
declamation
on
the
great
virtues
*NL*
of
his
pills
and
powders
,
the
corpse
of
one
of
his
martyrs
should
be
*NL*
brought
forth
,
and
deposited
before
the
stage
,
as
a
testimony
of
his
*NL*
skill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
,
therefore
,
of
answering
my
landlady
,
the
puppet-show
man
ran
*NL*
out
to
punish
his
Merry
Andrew
;
and
now
the
moon
beginning
to
put
*NL*
forth
her
silver
light
,
as
the
poets
call
it
-LRB-
though
she
looked
at
*NL*
that
time
more
like
a
piece
of
copper
-RRB-
,
Jones
called
for
his
*NL*
reckoning
,
and
ordered
Partridge
,
whom
my
landlady
had
just
awaked
*NL*
from
a
profound
nap
,
to
prepare
for
his
journey
;
but
Partridge
,
having
*NL*
lately
carried
two
points
,
as
my
reader
hath
seen
before
,
was
*NL*
emboldened
to
attempt
a
third
,
which
was
to
prevail
with
Jones
to
take
*NL*
up
a
lodging
that
evening
in
the
house
where
he
then
was
.
He
*NL*
introduced
this
with
an
affected
surprize
at
the
intention
which
Mr
*NL*
Jones
declared
of
removing
;
and
,
after
urging
many
excellent
arguments
*NL*
against
it
,
he
at
last
insisted
strongly
that
it
could
be
to
no
manner
*NL*
of
purpose
whatever
;
for
that
,
unless
Jones
knew
which
way
the
lady
*NL*
was
gone
,
every
step
he
took
might
very
possibly
lead
him
the
farther
*NL*
from
her
;
``
for
you
find
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
by
all
the
people
in
the
*NL*
house
,
that
she
is
not
gone
this
way
.
How
much
better
,
therefore
,
*NL*
would
it
be
to
stay
till
the
morning
,
when
we
may
expect
to
meet
with
*NL*
somebody
to
enquire
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
argument
had
indeed
some
effect
on
Jones
,
and
while
he
was
*NL*
weighing
it
the
landlord
threw
all
the
rhetoric
of
which
he
was
master
*NL*
into
the
same
scale
.
``
Sure
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
your
servant
gives
you
*NL*
most
excellent
advice
;
for
who
would
travel
by
night
at
this
time
of
*NL*
the
year
?
''
He
then
began
in
the
usual
stile
to
trumpet
forth
the
*NL*
excellent
accommodation
which
his
house
afforded
;
and
my
landlady
*NL*
likewise
opened
on
the
occasion
--
But
,
not
to
detain
the
reader
with
*NL*
what
is
common
to
every
host
and
hostess
,
it
is
sufficient
to
tell
him
*NL*
Jones
was
at
last
prevailed
on
to
stay
and
refresh
himself
with
a
few
*NL*
hours
'
rest
,
which
indeed
he
very
much
wanted
;
for
he
had
hardly
shut
*NL*
his
eyes
since
he
had
left
the
inn
where
the
accident
of
the
broken
*NL*
head
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Jones
had
taken
a
resolution
to
proceed
no
farther
that
*NL*
night
,
he
presently
retired
to
rest
,
with
his
two
bedfellows
,
the
*NL*
pocket-book
and
the
muff
;
but
Partridge
,
who
at
several
times
had
*NL*
refreshed
himself
with
several
naps
,
was
more
inclined
to
eating
than
*NL*
to
sleeping
,
and
more
to
drinking
than
to
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
storm
which
Grace
had
raised
being
at
an
end
,
and
my
*NL*
landlady
being
again
reconciled
to
the
puppet-man
,
who
on
his
side
*NL*
forgave
the
indecent
reflections
which
the
good
woman
in
her
passion
*NL*
had
cast
on
his
performances
,
a
face
of
perfect
peace
and
tranquillity
*NL*
reigned
in
the
kitchen
;
where
sat
assembled
round
the
fire
the
*NL*
landlord
and
landlady
of
the
house
,
the
master
of
the
puppet-show
,
the
*NL*
attorney
's
clerk
,
the
exciseman
,
and
the
ingenious
Mr
Partridge
;
in
*NL*
which
company
past
the
agreeable
conversation
which
will
be
found
in
*NL*
the
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
a
remark
or
two
of
our
own
and
many
more
of
the
good
*NL*
company
assembled
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
pride
of
Partridge
did
not
submit
to
acknowledge
himself
a
*NL*
servant
,
yet
he
condescended
in
most
particulars
to
imitate
the
*NL*
manners
of
that
rank
.
One
instance
of
this
was
,
his
greatly
magnifying
*NL*
the
fortune
of
his
companion
,
as
he
called
Jones
:
such
is
a
general
*NL*
custom
with
all
servants
among
strangers
,
as
none
of
them
would
*NL*
willingly
be
thought
the
attendant
on
a
beggar
:
for
,
the
higher
the
*NL*
situation
of
the
master
is
,
the
higher
consequently
is
that
of
the
man
*NL*
in
his
own
opinion
;
the
truth
of
which
observation
appears
from
the
*NL*
behaviour
of
all
the
footmen
of
the
nobility
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
though
title
and
fortune
communicate
a
splendor
all
around
them
,
*NL*
and
the
footmen
of
men
of
quality
and
of
estate
think
themselves
*NL*
entitled
to
a
part
of
that
respect
which
is
paid
to
the
quality
and
*NL*
estate
of
their
masters
,
it
is
clearly
otherwise
with
regard
to
virtue
*NL*
and
understanding
.
These
advantages
are
strictly
personal
,
and
swallow
*NL*
themselves
all
the
respect
which
is
paid
to
them
.
To
say
the
truth
,
*NL*
this
is
so
very
little
,
that
they
can
not
well
afford
to
let
any
others
*NL*
partake
with
them
.
As
these
therefore
reflect
no
honour
on
the
*NL*
domestic
,
so
neither
is
he
at
all
dishonoured
by
the
most
deplorable
*NL*
want
of
both
in
his
master
.
Indeed
it
is
otherwise
in
the
want
of
what
*NL*
is
called
virtue
in
a
mistress
,
the
consequence
of
which
we
have
*NL*
before
seen
:
for
in
this
dishonour
there
is
a
kind
of
contagion
,
*NL*
which
,
like
that
of
poverty
,
communicates
itself
to
all
who
approach
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
for
these
reasons
we
are
not
to
wonder
that
servants
-LRB-
I
mean
among
*NL*
the
men
only
-RRB-
should
have
so
great
regard
for
the
reputation
of
the
*NL*
wealth
of
their
masters
,
and
little
or
none
at
all
for
their
character
*NL*
in
other
points
,
and
that
,
though
they
would
be
ashamed
to
be
the
*NL*
footman
of
a
beggar
,
they
are
not
so
to
attend
upon
a
rogue
or
a
*NL*
blockhead
;
and
do
consequently
make
no
scruple
to
spread
the
fame
of
*NL*
the
iniquities
and
follies
of
their
said
masters
as
far
as
possible
,
*NL*
and
this
often
with
great
humour
and
merriment
.
In
reality
,
a
footman
*NL*
is
often
a
wit
as
well
as
a
beau
,
at
the
expence
of
the
gentleman
*NL*
whose
livery
he
wears
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Partridge
,
therefore
,
had
enlarged
greatly
on
the
vast
fortune
*NL*
to
which
Mr
Jones
was
heir
,
he
very
freely
communicated
an
*NL*
apprehension
,
which
he
had
begun
to
conceive
the
day
before
,
and
for
*NL*
which
,
as
we
hinted
at
that
very
time
,
the
behaviour
of
Jones
seemed
*NL*
to
have
furnished
a
sufficient
foundation
.
In
short
,
he
was
now
pretty
*NL*
well
confirmed
in
an
opinion
that
his
master
was
out
of
his
wits
,
with
*NL*
which
opinion
he
very
bluntly
acquainted
the
good
company
round
the
*NL*
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
sentiment
the
puppet-show
man
immediately
coincided
.
``
I
*NL*
own
,
''
said
he
,
``
the
gentleman
surprized
me
very
much
,
when
he
talked
*NL*
so
absurdly
about
puppet-shows
.
It
is
indeed
hardly
to
be
conceived
*NL*
that
any
man
in
his
senses
should
be
so
much
mistaken
;
what
you
say
*NL*
now
accounts
very
well
for
all
his
monstrous
notions
.
Poor
gentleman
!
*NL*
I
am
heartily
concerned
for
him
;
indeed
he
hath
a
strange
wildness
*NL*
about
his
eyes
,
which
I
took
notice
of
before
,
though
I
did
not
*NL*
mention
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
agreed
with
this
last
assertion
,
and
likewise
claimed
the
*NL*
sagacity
of
having
observed
it
.
``
And
certainly
,
''
added
he
,
``
it
must
be
*NL*
so
;
for
no
one
but
a
madman
would
have
thought
of
leaving
so
good
a
*NL*
house
to
ramble
about
the
country
at
that
time
of
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
exciseman
,
pulling
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
said
,
``
He
thought
the
*NL*
gentleman
looked
and
talked
a
little
wildly
;
''
and
then
turning
to
*NL*
Partridge
,
``
if
he
be
a
madman
,
''
says
he
,
``
he
should
not
be
suffered
to
*NL*
travel
thus
about
the
country
;
for
possibly
he
may
do
some
mischief
.
*NL*
It
is
a
pity
he
was
not
secured
and
sent
home
to
his
relations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
some
conceits
of
this
kind
were
likewise
lurking
in
the
mind
of
*NL*
Partridge
;
for
,
as
he
was
now
persuaded
that
Jones
had
run
away
from
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
,
he
promised
himself
the
highest
rewards
if
he
could
by
*NL*
any
means
convey
him
back
.
But
fear
of
Jones
,
of
whose
fierceness
and
*NL*
strength
he
had
seen
,
and
indeed
felt
,
some
instances
,
had
however
*NL*
represented
any
such
scheme
as
impossible
to
be
executed
,
and
had
*NL*
discouraged
him
from
applying
himself
to
form
any
regular
plan
for
the
*NL*
purpose
.
But
no
sooner
did
he
hear
the
sentiments
of
the
exciseman
*NL*
than
he
embraced
that
opportunity
of
declaring
his
own
,
and
expressed
*NL*
a
hearty
wish
that
such
a
matter
could
be
brought
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
be
brought
about
!
''
says
the
exciseman
:
``
why
,
there
is
nothing
*NL*
easier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
sir
,
''
answered
Partridge
,
``
you
do
n't
know
what
a
devil
of
a
*NL*
fellow
he
is
.
He
can
take
me
up
with
one
hand
,
and
throw
me
out
at
*NL*
window
;
and
he
would
,
too
,
if
he
did
but
imagine
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pogh
!
''
says
the
exciseman
,
``
I
believe
I
am
as
good
a
man
as
he
.
*NL*
Besides
,
here
are
five
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
what
five
,
''
cries
the
landlady
,
``
my
husband
shall
have
*NL*
nothing
to
do
in
it
.
Nor
shall
any
violent
hands
be
laid
upon
anybody
*NL*
in
my
house
.
The
young
gentleman
is
as
pretty
a
young
gentleman
as
*NL*
ever
I
saw
in
my
life
,
and
I
believe
he
is
no
more
mad
than
any
of
us
.
*NL*
What
do
you
tell
of
his
having
a
wild
look
with
his
eyes
?
they
are
the
*NL*
prettiest
eyes
I
ever
saw
,
and
he
hath
the
prettiest
look
with
them
;
*NL*
and
a
very
modest
civil
young
man
he
is

I
am
sure
I
have
bepitied
him
*NL*
heartily
ever
since
the
gentleman
there
in
the
corner
told
us
he
was
*NL*
crost
in
love
.
Certainly
that
is
enough
to
make
any
man
,
especially
*NL*
such
a
sweet
young
gentleman
as
he
is
,
to
look
a
little
otherwise
than
*NL*
he
did
before
.
Lady
,
indeed
!
what
the
devil
would
the
lady
have
better
*NL*
than
such
a
handsome
man
with
a
great
estate
?
I
suppose
she
is
one
of
*NL*
your
quality
folks
,
one
of
your
Townly
ladies
that
we
saw
last
night
*NL*
in
the
puppet-show
,
who
do
n't
know
what
they
would
be
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
attorney
's
clerk
likewise
declared
he
would
have
no
concern
in
the
*NL*
business
without
the
advice
of
counsel
.
``
Suppose
,
''
says
he
,
``
an
action
*NL*
of
false
imprisonment
should
be
brought
against
us
,
what
defence
could
*NL*
we
make
?
Who
knows
what
may
be
sufficient
evidence
of
madness
to
a
*NL*
jury
?
But
I
only
speak
upon
my
own
account
;
for
it
do
n't
look
well
for
*NL*
a
lawyer
to
be
concerned
in
these
matters
,
unless
it
be
as
a
lawyer
.
*NL*
Juries
are
always
less
favourable
to
us
than
to
other
people
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
therefore
dissuade
you
,
Mr
Thomson
-LRB-
to
the
exciseman
-RRB-
,
nor
the
*NL*
gentleman
,
nor
anybody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
exciseman
shook
his
head
at
this
speech
,
and
the
puppet-show
man
*NL*
said
,
``
Madness
was
sometimes
a
difficult
matter
for
a
jury
to
decide
:
*NL*
for
I
remember
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
was
once
present
at
a
tryal
of
madness
,
*NL*
where
twenty
witnesses
swore
that
the
person
was
as
mad
as
a
March
*NL*
hare
;
and
twenty
others
,
that
he
was
as
much
in
his
senses
as
any
man
*NL*
in
England
.
--
And
indeed
it
was
the
opinion
of
most
people
,
that
it
was
*NL*
only
a
trick
of
his
relations
to
rob
the
poor
man
of
his
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
!
''
cries
the
landlady
.
``
I
myself
knew
a
poor
gentleman
who
*NL*
was
kept
in
a
mad-house
all
his
life
by
his
family
,
and
they
enjoyed
*NL*
his
estate
,
but
it
did
them
no
good
;
for
though
the
law
gave
it
them
,
*NL*
it
was
the
right
of
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pogh
!
''
cries
the
clerk
,
with
great
contempt
,
``
who
hath
any
right
but
*NL*
what
the
law
gives
them
?
If
the
law
gave
me
the
best
estate
in
the
*NL*
country
,
I
should
never
trouble
myself
much
who
had
the
right

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
be
so

Partridge
,

*NL*
*NL*
My
landlord
,
who
had
been
called
out
by
the
arrival
of
a
horseman
at
*NL*
the
gate
,
now
returned
into
the
kitchen
,
and
with
an
affrighted
*NL*
countenance
cried
out
,
``
What
do
you
think
,
gentlemen
?
The
rebels
have
*NL*
given
the
duke
the
slip
,
and
are
got
almost
to
London
.
It
is
certainly
*NL*
true
,
for
a
man
on
horseback
just
now
told
me
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
it
with
all
my
heart
,
''
cries
Partridge
;
``
then
there
will
*NL*
be
no
fighting
in
these
parts

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
,
''
cries
the
clerk
,
``
for
a
better
reason
;
for
I
would
always
*NL*
have
right
take
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
but
,
''
answered
the
landlord
,
``
I
have
heard
some
people
say
this
*NL*
man
hath
no
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
prove
the
contrary
in
a
moment
,
''
cries
the
clerk
:
``
if
my
*NL*
father
dies
seized
of
a
right
;
do
you
mind
me
,
seized
of
a
right
,
I
*NL*
say
;
doth
not
that
right
descend
to
his
son
;
and
doth
not
one
right
*NL*
descend
as
well
as
another
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
he
have
any
right
to
make
us
papishes
?
''
says
the
*NL*
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
fear
that
,
''
cries
Partridge
.
``
As
to
the
matter
of
right
,
the
*NL*
gentleman
there
hath
proved
it
as
clear
as
the
sun
;
and
as
to
the
*NL*
matter
of
religion
,
it
is
quite
out
of
the
case
.
The
papists
*NL*
themselves
do
n't
expect
any
such
thing
.
A
popish
priest
,
whom
I
know
*NL*
very
well
,
and
who
is
a
very
honest
man
,
told
me
upon
his
word
and
*NL*
honour
they
had
no
such
design
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
another
priest
,
of
my
acquaintance
,
''
said
the
landlady
,
``
hath
*NL*
told
me
the
same
thing
;
but
my
husband
is
always
so
afraid
of
*NL*
papishes

I
know
a
great
many
papishes
that
are
very
honest
sort
of
*NL*
people
,
and
spend
their
money
very
freely
;
and
it
is
always
a
maxim
*NL*
with
me
,
that
one
man
's
money
is
as
good
as
another
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
mistress
,
''
said
the
puppet-show
man
,
``
I
do
n't
care
what
*NL*
religion
comes
;
provided
the
Presbyterians
are
not
uppermost
;
for
they
*NL*
are
enemies
to
puppet-shows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
would
sacrifice
your
religion
to
your
interest
,
''
cries
the
*NL*
exciseman
;
``
and
are
desirous
to
see
popery
brought
in
,
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I
,
truly
,
''
answered
the
other
;
``
I
hate
popery
as
much
as
any
man
;
*NL*
but
yet
it
is
a
comfort
to
one
,
that
one
should
be
able
to
live
under
*NL*
it
,
which
I
could
not
do
among
Presbyterians
.
To
be
sure
,
every
man
*NL*
values
his
livelihood
first
;
that
must
be
granted
;
and
I
warrant
,
if
*NL*
you
would
confess
the
truth
,
you
are
more
afraid
of
losing
your
place
*NL*
than
anything
else
;
but
never
fear
,
friend
,
there
will
be
an
excise
*NL*
under
another
government
as
well
as
under
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
certainly
,
''
replied
the
exciseman
,
``
I
should
be
a
very
ill
man
*NL*
if
I
did
not
honour
the
king
,
whose
bread
I
eat

That
is
no
more
than
*NL*
natural
,
as
a
man
may
say
:
for
what
signifies
it
to
me
that
there
*NL*
would
be
an
excise-office
under
another
government
,
since
my
friends
*NL*
would
be
out
,
and
I
could
expect
no
better
than
to
follow
them
?
No
,
*NL*
no
,
friend
,
I
shall
never
be
bubbled
out
of
my
religion
in
hopes
only
*NL*
of
keeping
my
place
under
another
government
;
for
I
should
certainly
*NL*
be
no
better
,
and
very
probably
might
be
worse
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
is
what
I
say
,
''
cries
the
landlord
,
``
whenever
folks
say
who
*NL*
knows
what
may
happen

Odsooks

should
not
I
be
a
blockhead
to
lend
my
*NL*
money
to
I
know
not
who
,
because
mayhap
he
may
return
it
again
?
I
am
*NL*
sure
it
is
safe
in
my
own
bureau
,
and
there
I
will
keep
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
attorney
's
clerk
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
the
sagacity
of
*NL*
Partridge
.
Whether
this
proceeded
from
the
great
discernment
which
the
*NL*
former
had
into
men
,
as
well
as
things
,
or
whether
it
arose
from
the
*NL*
sympathy
between
their
minds
;
for
they
were
both
truly
Jacobites
in
*NL*
principle
;
they
now
shook
hands
heartily
,
and
drank
bumpers
of
strong
*NL*
beer
to
healths
which
we
think
proper
to
bury
in
oblivion
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
healths
were
afterwards
pledged
by
all
present
,
and
even
by
my
*NL*
landlord
himself
,
though
reluctantly
;
but
he
could
not
withstand
the
*NL*
menaces
of
the
clerk
,
who
swore
he
would
never
set
his
foot
within
his
*NL*
house
again
,
if
he
refused
.
The
bumpers
which
were
swallowed
on
this
*NL*
occasion
soon
put
an
end
to
the
conversation
.
Here
,
therefore
,
we
will
*NL*
put
an
end
to
the
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
viii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
fortune
seems
to
have
been
in
a
better
humour
with
Jones
than
*NL*
we
have
hitherto
seen
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
there
is
no
wholesomer
,
so
perhaps
there
are
few
stronger
,
sleeping
*NL*
potions
than
fatigue
.
Of
this
Jones
might
be
said
to
have
taken
a
very
*NL*
large
dose
,
and
it
operated
very
forcibly
upon
him
.
He
had
already
*NL*
slept
nine
hours
,
and
might
perhaps
have
slept
longer
,
had
he
not
been
*NL*
awakened
by
a
most
violent
noise
at
his
chamber-door
,
where
the
sound
*NL*
of
many
heavy
blows
was
accompanied
with
many
exclamations
of
murder
.
*NL*
Jones
presently
leapt
from
his
bed
,
where
he
found
the
master
of
the
*NL*
puppet-show
belabouring
the
back
and
ribs
of
his
poor
Merry-Andrew
,
*NL*
without
either
mercy
or
moderation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
instantly
interposed
on
behalf
of
the
suffering
party
,
and
*NL*
pinned
the
insulting
conqueror
up
to
the
wall
:
for
the
puppet-show
man
*NL*
was
no
more
able
to
contend
with
Jones
than
the
poor
party-coloured
*NL*
jester
had
been
to
contend
with
this
puppet-man
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
the
Merry-Andrew
was
a
little
fellow
,
and
not
very
strong
,
*NL*
he
had
nevertheless
some
choler
about
him
.
He
therefore
no
sooner
*NL*
found
himself
delivered
from
the
enemy
,
than
he
began
to
attack
him
*NL*
with
the
only
weapon
at
which
he
was
his
equal
.
From
this
he
first
*NL*
discharged
a
volley
of
general
abusive
words
,
and
thence
proceeded
to
*NL*
some
particular
accusations
--
``
D
--
n
your
bl
--
d
,
you
rascal
,
''
says
he
,
*NL*
``
I
have
not
only
supported
you
-LRB-
for
to
me
you
owe
all
the
money
you
*NL*
get
-RRB-
,
but
I
have
saved
you
from
the
gallows
.
Did
you
not
want
to
rob
*NL*
the
lady
of
her
fine
riding-habit
,
no
longer
ago
than
yesterday
,
in
*NL*
the
back-lane
here
?
Can
you
deny
that
you
wished
to
have
her
alone
in
*NL*
a
wood
to
strip
her
--
to
strip
one
of
the
prettiest
ladies
that
ever
*NL*
was
seen
in
the
world
?
and
here
you
have
fallen
upon
me
,
and
have
*NL*
almost
murdered
me
,
for
doing
no
harm
to
a
girl
as
willing
as
myself
,
*NL*
only
because
she
likes
me
better
than
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
no
sooner
heard
this
than
he
quitted
the
master
,
laying
on
him
*NL*
at
the
same
time
the
most
violent
injunctions
of
forbearance
from
any
*NL*
further
insult
on
the
Merry-Andrew
;
and
then
taking
the
poor
wretch
*NL*
with
him
into
his
own
apartment
,
he
soon
learned
tidings
of
his
*NL*
Sophia
,
whom
the
fellow
,
as
he
was
attending
his
master
with
his
drum
*NL*
the
day
before
,
had
seen
pass
by
.
He
easily
prevailed
with
the
lad
to
*NL*
show
him
the
exact
place
,
and
then
having
summoned
Partridge
,
he
*NL*
departed
with
the
utmost
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
almost
eight
of
the
clock
before
all
matters
could
be
got
ready
*NL*
for
his
departure
:
for
Partridge
was
not
in
any
haste
,
nor
could
the
*NL*
reckoning
be
presently
adjusted
;
and
when
both
these
were
settled
and
*NL*
over
,
Jones
would
not
quit
the
place
before
he
had
perfectly
*NL*
reconciled
all
differences
between
the
master
and
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
was
happily
accomplished
,
he
set
forwards
,
and
was
by
the
*NL*
trusty
Merry-Andrew
conducted
to
the
spot
by
which
Sophia
had
past
;
*NL*
and
then
having
handsomely
rewarded
his
conductor
,
he
again
pushed
on
*NL*
with
the
utmost
eagerness
,
being
highly
delighted
with
the
*NL*
extraordinary
manner
in
which
he
received
his
intelligence
.
Of
this
*NL*
Partridge
was
no
sooner
acquainted
,
than
he
,
with
great
earnestness
,
*NL*
began
to
prophesy
,
and
assured
Jones
that
he
would
certainly
have
good
*NL*
success
in
the
end
:
for
,
he
said
,
``
two
such
accidents
could
never
have
*NL*
happened
to
direct
him
after
his
mistress
,
if
Providence
had
not
*NL*
designed
to
bring
them
together
at
last
.
''
And
this
was
the
first
time
*NL*
that
Jones
lent
any
attention
to
the
superstitious
doctrines
of
his
*NL*
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
gone
above
two
miles
when
a
violent
storm
of
rain
*NL*
overtook
them
;
and
,
as
they
happened
to
be
at
the
same
time
in
sight
*NL*
of
an
ale-house
,
Partridge
,
with
much
earnest
entreaty
,
prevailed
with
*NL*
Jones
to
enter
,
and
weather
the
storm
.
Hunger
is
an
enemy
-LRB-
if
indeed
*NL*
it
may
be
called
one
-RRB-
which
partakes
more
of
the
English
than
of
the
*NL*
French
disposition
;
for
,
though
you
subdue
this
never
so
often
,
it
*NL*
will
always
rally
again
in
time
;
and
so
it
did
with
Partridge
,
who
was
*NL*
no
sooner
arrived
within
the
kitchen
,
than
he
began
to
ask
the
same
*NL*
questions
which
he
had
asked
the
night
before
.
The
consequence
of
this
*NL*
was
an
excellent
cold
chine
being
produced
upon
the
table
,
upon
which
*NL*
not
only
Partridge
,
but
Jones
himself
,
made
a
very
hearty
breakfast
,
*NL*
though
the
latter
began
to
grow
again
uneasy
,
as
the
people
of
the
*NL*
house
could
give
him
no
fresh
information
concerning
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
meal
being
over
,
Jones
was
again
preparing
to
sally
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
violence
of
the
storm
still
continued
;
but
*NL*
Partridge
begged
heartily
for
another
mug
;
and
at
last
casting
his
*NL*
eyes
on
a
lad
at
the
fire
,
who
had
entered
into
the
kitchen
,
and
who
*NL*
at
that
instant
was
looking
as
earnestly
at
him
,
he
turned
suddenly
to
*NL*
Jones
,
and
cried
,
``
Master
,
give
me
your
hand
,
a
single
mug
sha
n't
*NL*
serve
the
turn
this
bout
.

come
*NL*
to
town
.
The
boy
there
standing
by
the
fire
is
the
very
lad
that
rode
*NL*
before
her
.
I
can
swear
to
my
own
plaister
on
his
face
.
''
--
``
Heavens
*NL*
bless
you
,
sir
,
''
cries
the
boy
,
``
it
is
your
own
plaister
sure
enough
;
*NL*
I
shall
have
always
reason
to
remember
your
goodness
;
for
it
hath
*NL*
almost
cured
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
Jones
started
from
his
chair
,
and
,
bidding
the
boy
*NL*
follow
him
immediately
,
departed
from
the
kitchen
into
a
private
*NL*
apartment
;
for
,
so
delicate
was
he
with
regard
to
Sophia
,
that
he
*NL*
never
willingly
mentioned
her
name
in
the
presence
of
many
people
;
*NL*
and
,
though
he
had
,
as
it
were
,
from
the
overflowings
of
his
heart
,
*NL*
given
Sophia
as
a
toast
among
the
officers
,
where
he
thought
it
was
*NL*
impossible
she
should
be
known
;
yet
,
even
there
,
the
reader
may
*NL*
remember
how
difficultly
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
mention
her
surname
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hard
therefore
was
it
,
and
perhaps
,
in
the
opinion
of
many
sagacious
*NL*
readers
,
very
absurd
and
monstrous
,
that
he
should
principally
owe
his
*NL*
present
misfortune
to
the
supposed
want
of
that
delicacy
with
which
he
*NL*
so
abounded
;
for
,
in
reality
,
Sophia
was
much
more
offended
at
the
*NL*
freedoms
which
she
thought
-LRB-
and
not
without
good
reason
-RRB-
he
had
taken
*NL*
with
her
name
and
character
,
than
at
any
freedoms
,
in
which
,
under
his
*NL*
present
circumstances
,
he
had
indulged
himself
with
the
person
of
*NL*
another
woman
;
and
to
say
truth
,
I
believe
Honour
could
never
have
*NL*
prevailed
on
her
to
leave
Upton
without
her
seeing
Jones
,
had
it
not
*NL*
been
for
those
two
strong
instances
of
a
levity
in
his
behaviour
,
so
*NL*
void
of
respect
,
and
indeed
so
highly
inconsistent
with
any
degree
of
*NL*
love
and
tenderness
in
great
and
delicate
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
so
matters
fell
out
,
and
so
I
must
relate
them
;
and
if
any
reader
*NL*
is
shocked
at
their
appearing
unnatural
,
I
can
not
help
it
.
I
must
*NL*
remind
such
persons
that
I
am
not
writing
a
system
,
but
a
history
,
and
*NL*
I
am
not
obliged
to
reconcile
every
matter
to
the
received
notions
*NL*
concerning
truth
and
nature
.
But
if
this
was
never
so
easy
to
do
,
*NL*
perhaps
it
might
be
more
prudent
in
me
to
avoid
it
.
For
instance
,
as
*NL*
the
fact
at
present
before
us
now
stands
,
without
any
comment
of
mine
*NL*
upon
it
,
though
it
may
at
first
sight
offend
some
readers
,
yet
,
upon
*NL*
more
mature
consideration
,
it
must
please
all
;
for
wise
and
good
men
*NL*
may
consider
what
happened
to
Jones
at
Upton
as
a
just
punishment
for
*NL*
his
wickedness
with
regard
to
women
,
of
which
it
was
indeed
the
*NL*
immediate
consequence
;
and
silly
and
bad
persons
may
comfort
*NL*
themselves
in
their
vices
by
flattering
their
own
hearts
that
the
*NL*
characters
of
men
are
rather
owing
to
accident
than
to
virtue
.
Now
,
*NL*
perhaps
the
reflections
which
we
should
be
here
inclined
to
draw
would
*NL*
alike
contradict
both
these
conclusions
,
and
would
show
that
these
*NL*
incidents
contribute
only
to
confirm
the
great
,
useful
,
and
uncommon
*NL*
doctrine
,
which
it
is
the
purpose
of
this
whole
work
to
inculcate
,
and
*NL*
which
we
must
not
fill
up
our
pages
by
frequently
repeating
,
as
an
*NL*
ordinary
parson
fills
his
sermon
by
repeating
his
text
at
the
end
of
*NL*
every
paragraph
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
contented
that
it
must
appear
,
however
unhappily
Sophia
had
*NL*
erred
in
her
opinion
of
Jones
,
she
had
sufficient
reason
for
her
*NL*
opinion
;
since
,
I
believe
,
every
other
young
lady
would
,
in
her
*NL*
situation
,
have
erred
in
the
same
manner
.
Nay
,
had
she
followed
her
*NL*
lover
at
this
very
time
,
and
had
entered
this
very
alehouse
the
moment
*NL*
he
was
departed
from
it
,
she
would
have
found
the
landlord
as
well
*NL*
acquainted
with
her
name
and
person
as
the
wench
at
Upton
had
appeared
*NL*
to
be
.
For
while
Jones
was
examining
his
boy
in
whispers
in
an
inner
*NL*
room
,
Partridge
,
who
had
no
such
delicacy
in
his
disposition
,
was
in
*NL*
the
kitchen
very
openly
catechising
the
other
guide
who
had
attended
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
by
which
means
the
landlord
,
whose
ears
were
open
on
*NL*
all
such
occasions
,
became
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
tumble
*NL*
of
Sophia
from
her
horse
,
&
c.
,
with
the
mistake
concerning
Jenny
*NL*
Cameron
,
with
the
many
consequences
of
the
punch
,
and
,
in
short
,
with
*NL*
almost
everything
which
had
happened
at
the
inn
whence
we
despatched
*NL*
our
ladies
in
a
coach-and-six
when
we
last
took
our
leaves
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
ix
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
little
more
than
a
few
odd
observations
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
been
absent
a
full
half-hour
,
when
he
returned
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
in
a
hurry
,
desiring
the
landlord
to
let
him
know
that
instant
*NL*
what
was
to
pay
.
And
now
the
concern
which
Partridge
felt
at
being
*NL*
obliged
to
quit
the
warm
chimney-corner
,
and
a
cup
of
excellent
*NL*
liquor
,
was
somewhat
compensated
by
hearing
that
he
was
to
proceed
no
*NL*
farther
on
foot
,
for
Jones
,
by
golden
arguments
,
had
prevailed
with
*NL*
the
boy
to
attend
him
back
to
the
inn
whither
he
had
before
conducted
*NL*
Sophia
;
but
to
this
however
the
lad
consented
,
upon
condition
that
the
*NL*
other
guide
would
wait
for
him
at
the
alehouse
;
because
,
as
the
*NL*
landlord
at
Upton
was
an
intimate
acquaintance
of
the
landlord
at
*NL*
Gloucester
,
it
might
some
time
or
other
come
to
the
ears
of
the
latter
*NL*
that
his
horses
had
been
let
to
more
than
one
person
;
and
so
the
boy
*NL*
might
be
brought
to
account
for
money
which
he
wisely
intended
to
put
*NL*
in
his
own
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
obliged
to
mention
this
circumstance
,
trifling
as
it
may
seem
,
*NL*
since
it
retarded
Mr
Jones
a
considerable
time
in
his
setting
out
;
for
*NL*
the
honesty
of
this
latter
boy
was
somewhat
high
--
that
is
,
somewhat
*NL*
high-priced
,
and
would
indeed
have
cost
Jones
very
dear
,
had
not
*NL*
Partridge
,
who
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
a
very
cunning
fellow
,
artfully
*NL*
thrown
in
half-a-crown
to
be
spent
at
that
very
alehouse
,
while
the
*NL*
boy
was
waiting
for
his
companion
.
This
half-crown
the
landlord
no
*NL*
sooner
got
scent
of
,
than
he
opened
after
it
with
such
vehement
and
*NL*
persuasive
outcry
,
that
the
boy
was
soon
overcome
,
and
consented
to
*NL*
take
half-a-crown
more
for
his
stay
.
Here
we
can
not
help
observing
,
*NL*
that
as
there
is
so
much
of
policy
in
the
lowest
life
,
great
men
often
*NL*
overvalue
themselves
on
those
refinements
in
imposture
,
in
which
they
*NL*
are
frequently
excelled
by
some
of
the
lowest
of
the
human
species
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
being
now
produced
,
Jones
directly
leapt
into
the
*NL*
side-saddle
,
on
which
his
dear
Sophia
had
rid
.
The
lad
,
indeed
,
very
*NL*
civilly
offered
him
the
use
of
his
;
but
he
chose
the
side-saddle
,
*NL*
probably
because
it
was
softer
.
Partridge
,
however
,
though
full
as
*NL*
effeminate
as
Jones
,
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
degrading
his
*NL*
manhood
;
he
therefore
accepted
the
boy
's
offer
:
and
now
,
Jones
being
*NL*
mounted
on
the
side-saddle
of
his
Sophia
,
the
boy
on
that
of
Mrs
*NL*
Honour
,
and
Partridge
bestriding
the
third
horse
,
they
set
forwards
on
*NL*
their
journey
,
and
within
four
hours
arrived
at
the
inn
where
the
*NL*
reader
hath
already
spent
so
much
time
.
Partridge
was
in
very
high
*NL*
spirits
during
the
whole
way
,
and
often
mentioned
to
Jones
the
many
*NL*
good
omens
of
his
future
success
which
had
lately
befriended
him
;
and
*NL*
which
the
reader
,
without
being
the
least
superstitious
,
must
allow
to
*NL*
have
been
particularly
fortunate
.
Partridge
was
moreover
better
*NL*
pleased
with
the
present
pursuit
of
his
companion
than
he
had
been
*NL*
with
his
pursuit
of
glory
;
and
from
these
very
omens
,
which
assured
*NL*
the
pedagogue
of
success
,
he
likewise
first
acquired
a
clear
idea
of
*NL*
the
amour
between
Jones
and
Sophia
;
to
which
he
had
before
given
very
*NL*
little
attention
,
as
he
had
originally
taken
a
wrong
scent
concerning
*NL*
the
reasons
of
Jones
's
departure
;
and
as
to
what
happened
at
Upton
,
he
*NL*
was
too
much
frightened
just
before
and
after
his
leaving
that
place
*NL*
to
draw
any
other
conclusions
from
thence
than
that
poor
Jones
was
a
*NL*
downright
madman
:
a
conceit
which
was
not
at
all
disagreeable
to
the
*NL*
opinion
he
before
had
of
his
extraordinary
wildness
,
of
which
,
he
*NL*
thought
,
his
behaviour
on
their
quitting
Gloucester
so
well
justified
*NL*
all
the
accounts
he
had
formerly
received
.
He
was
now
,
however
,
pretty
*NL*
well
satisfied
with
his
present
expedition
,
and
henceforth
began
to
*NL*
conceive
much
worthier
sentiments
of
his
friend
's
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
had
just
struck
three
when
they
arrived
,
and
Jones
*NL*
immediately
bespoke
post-horses
;
but
unluckily
there
was
not
a
horse
*NL*
to
be
procured
in
the
whole
place
;
which
the
reader
will
not
wonder
at
*NL*
when
he
considers
the
hurry
in
which
the
whole
nation
,
and
especially
*NL*
this
part
of
it
,
was
at
this
time
engaged
,
when
expresses
were
passing
*NL*
and
repassing
every
hour
of
the
day
and
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
endeavoured
all
he
could
to
prevail
with
his
former
guide
to
*NL*
escorte
him
to
Coventry
;
but
he
was
inexorable
.
While
he
was
arguing
*NL*
with
the
boy
in
the
inn-yard
,
a
person
came
up
to
him
,
and
saluting
*NL*
him
by
his
name
,
enquired
how
all
the
good
family
did
in
*NL*
Somersetshire
;
and
now
Jones
casting
his
eyes
upon
this
person
,
*NL*
presently
discovered
him
to
be
Mr
Dowling
,
the
lawyer
,
with
whom
he
*NL*
had
dined
at
Gloucester
,
and
with
much
courtesy
returned
the
*NL*
salutation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dowling
very
earnestly
pressed
Mr
Jones
to
go
no
further
that
night
;
*NL*
and
backed
his
solicitations
with
many
unanswerable
arguments
,
such
*NL*
as
,
that
it
was
almost
dark
,
that
the
roads
were
very
dirty
,
and
that
*NL*
he
would
be
able
to
travel
much
better
by
day-light
,
with
many
others
*NL*
equally
good
,
some
of
which
Jones
had
probably
suggested
to
himself
*NL*
before
;
but
as
they
were
then
ineffectual
,
so
they
were
still
:
and
he
*NL*
continued
resolute
in
his
design
,
even
though
he
should
be
obliged
to
*NL*
set
out
on
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
good
attorney
found
he
could
not
prevail
on
Jones
to
stay
,
he
*NL*
as
strenuously
applied
himself
to
persuade
the
guide
to
accompany
him
.
*NL*
He
urged
many
motives
to
induce
him
to
undertake
this
short
journey
,
*NL*
and
at
last
concluded
with
saying
,
``
Do
you
think
the
gentleman
wo
n't
*NL*
very
well
reward
you
for
your
trouble
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
to
one
are
odds
at
every
other
thing
as
well
as
at
foot-ball
.
But
*NL*
the
advantage
which
this
united
force
hath
in
persuasion
or
entreaty
*NL*
must
have
been
visible
to
a
curious
observer
;
for
he
must
have
often
*NL*
seen
,
that
when
a
father
,
a
master
,
a
wife
,
or
any
other
person
in
*NL*
authority
,
have
stoutly
adhered
to
a
denial
against
all
the
reasons
*NL*
which
a
single
man
could
produce
,
they
have
afterwards
yielded
to
the
*NL*
repetition
of
the
same
sentiments
by
a
second
or
third
person
,
who
*NL*
hath
undertaken
the
cause
,
without
attempting
to
advance
anything
new
*NL*
in
its
behalf
.
And
hence
,
perhaps
,
proceeds
the
phrase
of
seconding
an
*NL*
argument
or
a
motion
,
and
the
great
consequence
this
is
of
in
all
*NL*
assemblies
of
public
debate
.
Hence
,
likewise
,
probably
it
is
,
that
in
*NL*
our
courts
of
law
we
often
hear
a
learned
gentleman
-LRB-
generally
a
*NL*
serjeant
-RRB-
repeating
for
an
hour
together
what
another
learned
*NL*
gentleman
,
who
spoke
just
before
him
,
had
been
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
accounting
for
this
,
we
shall
proceed
in
our
usual
manner
*NL*
to
exemplify
it
in
the
conduct
of
the
lad
above
mentioned
,
who
*NL*
submitted
to
the
persuasions
of
Mr
Dowling
,
and
promised
once
more
to
*NL*
admit
Jones
into
his
side-saddle
;
but
insisted
on
first
giving
the
*NL*
poor
creatures
a
good
bait
,
saying
,
they
had
travelled
a
great
way
,
*NL*
and
been
rid
very
hard
.
Indeed
this
caution
of
the
boy
was
needless
;
*NL*
for
Jones
,
notwithstanding
his
hurry
and
impatience
,
would
have
*NL*
ordered
this
of
himself
;
for
he
by
no
means
agreed
with
the
opinion
of
*NL*
those
who
consider
animals
as
mere
machines
,
and
when
they
bury
their
*NL*
spurs
in
the
belly
of
their
horse
,
imagine
the
spur
and
the
horse
to
*NL*
have
an
equal
capacity
of
feeling
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
beasts
were
eating
their
corn
,
or
rather
were
supposed
to
*NL*
eat
it
-LRB-
for
,
as
the
boy
was
taking
care
of
himself
in
the
kitchen
,
the
*NL*
ostler
took
great
care
that
his
corn
should
not
be
consumed
in
the
*NL*
stable
-RRB-
,
Mr
Jones
,
at
the
earnest
desire
of
Mr
Dowling
,
accompanied
*NL*
that
gentleman
into
his
room
,
where
they
sat
down
together
over
a
*NL*
bottle
of
wine
.

,
we
will
likewise
*NL*
remember
his
nephew
and
heir
,
the
young
squire
:
Come
,
sir
,
here
's
Mr
*NL*
Blifil
to
you
,
a
very
pretty
young
gentleman
;
and
who
,
I
dare
swear
,
*NL*
will
hereafter
make
a
very
considerable
figure
in
his
country
.
I
have
*NL*
a
borough
for
him
myself
in
my
eye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
I
am
convinced
you
do
n't
intend
to
affront
me
,
*NL*
so
I
shall
not
resent
it
;
but
I
promise
you
,
you
have
joined
two
*NL*
persons
very
improperly
together
;
for
one
is
the
glory
of
the
human
*NL*
species
,
and
the
other
is
a
rascal
who
dishonours
the
name
of
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dowling
stared
at
this
.
He
said
,
``
He
thought
both
the
gentlemen
had
a
*NL*
very
unexceptionable
character
.
As
for
Squire
Allworthy
himself
,
''
says
*NL*
he
,
``
I
never
had
the
happiness
to
see
him
;
but
all
the
world
talks
of
*NL*
his
goodness
.
And
,
indeed
,
as
to
the
young
gentleman
,
I
never
saw
him
*NL*
but
once
,
when
I
carried
him
the
news
of
the
loss
of
his
mother
;
and
*NL*
then
I
was
so
hurried
,
and
drove
,
and
tore
with
the
multiplicity
of
*NL*
business
,
that
I
had
hardly
time
to
converse
with
him
;
but
he
looked
*NL*
so
like
a
very
honest
gentleman
,
and
behaved
himself
so
prettily
,
that
*NL*
I
protest
I
never
was
more
delighted
with
any
gentleman
since
I
was
*NL*
born
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
wonder
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
that
he
should
impose
upon
you
in
*NL*
so
short
an
acquaintance
;
for
he
hath
the
cunning
of
the
devil
*NL*
himself
,
and
you
may
live
with
him
many
years
,
without
discovering
*NL*
him
.
I
was
bred
up
with
him
from
my
infancy
,
and
we
were
hardly
ever
*NL*
asunder
;
but
it
is
very
lately
only
that
I
have
discovered
half
the
*NL*
villany
which
is
in
him
.
I
own
I
never
greatly
liked
him
.
I
thought
he
*NL*
wanted
that
generosity
of
spirit
,
which
is
the
sure
foundation
of
all
*NL*
that
is
great
and
noble
in
human
nature
.
I
saw
a
selfishness
in
him
*NL*
long
ago
which
I
despised
;
but
it
is
lately
,
very
lately
,
that
I
have
*NL*
found
him
capable
of
the
basest
and
blackest
designs
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
*NL*
have
at
last
found
out
,
that
he
hath
taken
an
advantage
of
the
*NL*
openness
of
my
own
temper
,
and
hath
concerted
the
deepest
project
,
by
*NL*
a
long
train
of
wicked
artifice
,
to
work
my
ruin
,
which
at
last
he
*NL*
hath
effected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
!
ay
!
''
cries
Dowling
;
``
I
protest
,
then
,
it
is
a
pity
such
a
person
*NL*
should
inherit
the
great
estate
of
your
uncle
Allworthy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
sir
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
you
do
me
an
honour
to
which
I
have
no
*NL*
title
.
It
is
true
,
indeed
,
his
goodness
once
allowed
me
the
liberty
of
*NL*
calling
him
by
a
much
nearer
name
;
but
as
this
was
only
a
voluntary
*NL*
act
of
goodness
,
I
can
complain
of
no
injustice
when
he
thinks
proper
*NL*
to
deprive
me
of
this
honour
;
since
the
loss
can
not
be
more
unmerited
*NL*
than
the
gift
originally
was
.
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
I
am
no
relation
of
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
if
the
world
,
who
are
incapable
of
setting
a
true
*NL*
value
on
his
virtue
,
should
think
,
in
his
behaviour
to
me
,
he
hath
*NL*
dealt
hardly
by
a
relation
,
they
do
an
injustice
to
the
best
of
men
:
*NL*
for
I
--
but
I
ask
your
pardon
,
I
shall
trouble
you
with
no
particulars
*NL*
relating
to
myself
;
only
as
you
seemed
to
think
me
a
relation
of
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
I
thought
proper
to
set
you
right
in
a
matter
that
might
*NL*
draw
some
censures
upon
him
,
which
I
promise
you
I
would
rather
lose
*NL*
my
life
than
give
occasion
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
protest
,
sir
,
''
cried
Dowling
,
``
you
talk
very
much
like
a
man
of
*NL*
honour
;
but
instead
of
giving
me
any
trouble
,
I
protest
it
would
give
*NL*
me
great
pleasure
to
know
how
you
came
to
be
thought
a
relation
of
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
's
,
if
you
are
not
.
Your
horses
wo
n't
be
ready
this
*NL*
half-hour
,
and
as
you
have
sufficient
opportunity
,
I
wish
you
would
*NL*
tell
me
how
all
that
happened
;
for
I
protest
it
seems
very
surprizing
*NL*
that
you
should
pass
for
a
relation
of
a
gentleman
,
without
being
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
who
in
the
compliance
of
his
disposition
-LRB-
though
not
in
his
*NL*
prudence
-RRB-
a
little
resembled
his
lovely
Sophia
,
was
easily
prevailed
*NL*
on
to
satisfy
Mr
Dowling
's
curiosity
,
by
relating
the
history
of
his
*NL*
birth
and
education
,
which
he
did
,
like
Othello
.
*NL*
*NL*
------
Even
from
his
boyish
years
,
*NL*
To
th
'
very
moment
he
was
bad
to
tell
:
*NL*
*NL*
the
which
to
hear
,
Dowling
,
like
Desdemona
,
did
seriously
incline
;
*NL*
*NL*
He
swore
't
was
strange
,
't
was
passing
strange
;
*NL*
'T
was
pitiful
,
't
was
wonderous
pitiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Dowling
was
indeed
very
greatly
affected
with
this
relation
;
for
he
*NL*
had
not
divested
himself
of
humanity
by
being
an
attorney
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
nothing
is
more
unjust
than
to
carry
our
prejudices
against
a
*NL*
profession
into
private
life
,
and
to
borrow
our
idea
of
a
man
from
our
*NL*
opinion
of
his
calling
.
Habit
,
it
is
true
,
lessens
the
horror
of
those
*NL*
actions
which
the
profession
makes
necessary
,
and
consequently
*NL*
habitual
;
but
in
all
other
instances
,
Nature
works
in
men
of
all
*NL*
professions
alike
;
nay
,
perhaps
,
even
more
strongly
with
those
who
*NL*
give
her
,
as
it
were
,
a
holiday
,
when
they
are
following
their
*NL*
ordinary
business
.
A
butcher
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
would
feel
compunction
*NL*
at
the
slaughter
of
a
fine
horse
;
and
though
a
surgeon
can
feel
no
*NL*
pain
in
cutting
off
a
limb
,
I
have
known
him
compassionate
a
man
in
a
*NL*
fit
of
the
gout
.
The
common
hangman
,
who
hath
stretched
the
necks
of
*NL*
hundreds
,
is
known
to
have
trembled
at
his
first
operation
on
a
head
:
*NL*
and
the
very
professors
of
human
blood-shedding
,
who
,
in
their
trade
*NL*
of
war
,
butcher
thousands
,
not
only
of
their
fellow-professors
,
but
*NL*
often
of
women
and
children
,
without
remorse
;
even
these
,
I
say
,
in
*NL*
times
of
peace
,
when
drums
and
trumpets
are
laid
aside
,
often
lay
*NL*
aside
all
their
ferocity
,
and
become
very
gentle
members
of
civil
*NL*
society
.
In
the
same
manner
an
attorney
may
feel
all
the
miseries
and
*NL*
distresses
of
his
fellow-creatures
,
provided
he
happens
not
to
be
*NL*
concerned
against
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
was
yet
unacquainted
with
the
very
black
*NL*
colours
in
which
he
had
been
represented
to
Mr
Allworthy
;
and
as
to
*NL*
other
matters
,
he
did
not
shew
them
in
the
most
disadvantageous
light
;
*NL*
for
though
he
was
unwilling
to
cast
any
blame
on
his
former
friend
and
*NL*
patron
;
yet
he
was
not
very
desirous
of
heaping
too
much
upon
himself
.
*NL*
Dowling
therefore
observed
,
and
not
without
reason
,
that
very
ill
*NL*
offices
must
have
been
done
him
by
somebody
:
``
For
certainly
,
''
cries
*NL*
he
,
``
the
squire
would
never
have
disinherited
you
only
for
a
few
*NL*
faults
,
which
any
young
gentleman
might
have
committed
.
Indeed
,
I
*NL*
can
not
properly
say
disinherited
:
for
to
be
sure
by
law
you
can
not
*NL*
claim
as
heir
.
That
's
certain
;
that
nobody
need
go
to
counsel
for
.
Yet
*NL*
when
a
gentleman
had
in
a
manner
adopted
you
thus
as
his
own
son
,
you
*NL*
might
reasonably
have
expected
some
very
considerable
part
,
if
not
the
*NL*
whole
;
nay
,
if
you
had
expected
the
whole
,
I
should
not
have
blamed
*NL*
you
:
for
certainly
all
men
are
for
getting
as
much
as
they
can
,
and
*NL*
they
are
not
to
be
blamed
on
that
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
wrong
me
,
''
said
Jones
;
``
I
should
have
been
contented
with
*NL*
very
little
:
I
never
had
any
view
upon
Mr
Allworthy
's
fortune
;
nay
,
I
*NL*
believe
I
may
truly
say
,
I
never
once
considered
what
he
could
or
*NL*
might
give
me
.
This
I
solemnly
declare
,
if
he
had
done
a
prejudice
to
*NL*
his
nephew
in
my
favour
,
I
would
have
undone
it
again
.
I
had
rather
*NL*
enjoy
my
own
mind
than
the
fortune
of
another
man
.
What
is
the
poor
*NL*
pride
arising
from
a
magnificent
house
,
a
numerous
equipage
,
a
*NL*
splendid
table
,
and
from
all
the
other
advantages
or
appearances
of
*NL*
fortune
,
compared
to
the
warm
,
solid
content
,
the
swelling
*NL*
satisfaction
,
the
thrilling
transports
,
and
the
exulting
triumphs
,
*NL*
which
a
good
mind
enjoys
,
in
the
contemplation
of
a
generous
,
*NL*
virtuous
,
noble
,
benevolent
action
?
I
envy
not
Blifil
in
the
prospect
*NL*
of
his
wealth
;
nor
shall
I
envy
him
in
the
possession
of
it
.
I
would
*NL*
not
think
myself
a
rascal
half
an
hour
,
to
exchange
situations
.
I
*NL*
believe
,
indeed
,
Mr
Blifil
suspected
me
of
the
views
you
mention
;
and
*NL*
I
suppose
these
suspicions
,
as
they
arose
from
the
baseness
of
his
own
*NL*
heart
,
so
they
occasioned
his
baseness
to
me
.
But
,
I
thank
Heaven
,
I
*NL*
know
,
I
feel
--
I
feel
my
innocence
,
my
friend
;
and
I
would
not
part
*NL*
with
that
feeling
for
the
world
.
For
as
long
as
I
know
I
have
never
*NL*
done
,
nor
even
designed
,
an
injury
to
any
being
whatever

He
then
filled
a
bumper
of
wine
,
and
drunk
it
off
to
the
health
of
his
*NL*
dear
Lalage
;
and
,
filling
Dowling
's
glass
likewise
up
to
the
brim
,
*NL*
insisted
on
his
pledging
him
.
``
Why
,
then
,
here
's
Miss
Lalage
's
health
*NL*
with
all
my
heart

''
cries
Dowling
.
``
I
have
heard
her
toasted
often
,
I
*NL*
protest
,
though
I
never
saw
her
;
but
they
say
she
's
extremely
*NL*
handsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
Latin
was
not
the
only
part
of
this
speech
which
Dowling
*NL*
did
not
perfectly
understand
;
yet
there
was
somewhat
in
it
that
made
a
*NL*
very
strong
impression
upon
him
.
And
though
he
endeavoured
by
winking
,
*NL*
nodding
,
sneering
,
and
grinning
,
to
hide
the
impression
from
Jones
*NL*
-LRB-
for
we
are
as
often
ashamed
of
thinking
right
as
of
thinking
wrong
-RRB-
,
*NL*
it
is
certain
he
secretly
approved
as
much
of
his
sentiments
as
he
*NL*
understood
,
and
really
felt
a
very
strong
impulse
of
compassion
for
*NL*
him
.
But
we
may
possibly
take
some
other
opportunity
of
commenting
*NL*
upon
this
,
especially
if
we
should
happen
to
meet
Mr
Dowling
any
more
*NL*
in
the
course
of
our
history
.
At
present
we
are
obliged
to
take
our
*NL*
leave
of
that
gentleman
a
little
abruptly
,
in
imitation
of
Mr
Jones
;
*NL*
who
was
no
sooner
informed
,
by
Partridge
,
that
his
horses
were
ready
,
*NL*
than
he
deposited
his
reckoning
,
wished
his
companion
a
good
night
,
*NL*
mounted
,
and
set
forward
towards
Coventry
,
though
the
night
was
dark
,
*NL*
and
it
just
then
began
to
rain
very
hard
.

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
xi
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
disasters
which
befel
Jones
on
his
departure
for
Coventry
;
with
*NL*
the
sage
remarks
of
Partridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
No
road
can
be
plainer
than
that
from
the
place
where
they
now
were
to
*NL*
Coventry
;
and
though
neither
Jones
,
nor
Partridge
,
nor
the
guide
,
had
*NL*
ever
travelled
it
before
,
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
to
have
*NL*
missed
their
way
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
two
reasons
mentioned
in
the
*NL*
conclusion
of
the
last
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
circumstances
,
however
,
happening
both
unfortunately
to
*NL*
intervene
,
our
travellers
deviated
into
a
much
less
frequented
track
;
*NL*
and
after
riding
full
six
miles
,
instead
of
arriving
at
the
stately
*NL*
spires
of
Coventry
,
they
found
themselves
still
in
a
very
dirty
lane
,
*NL*
where
they
saw
no
symptoms
of
approaching
the
suburbs
of
a
large
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
now
declared
that
they
must
certainly
have
lost
their
way
;
but
*NL*
this
the
guide
insisted
upon
was
impossible
;
a
word
which
,
in
common
*NL*
conversation
,
is
often
used
to
signify
not
only
improbable
,
but
often
*NL*
what
is
really
very
likely
,
and
,
sometimes
,
what
hath
certainly
*NL*
happened
;
an
hyperbolical
violence
like
that
which
is
so
frequently
*NL*
offered
to
the
words
infinite
and
eternal
;
by
the
former
of
which
it
*NL*
is
usual
to
express
a
distance
of
half
a
yard
,
and
by
the
latter
,
a
*NL*
duration
of
five
minutes
.
And
thus
it
is
as
usual
to
assert
the
*NL*
impossibility
of
losing
what
is
already
actually
lost
.
This
was
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
the
case
at
present
;
for
,
notwithstanding
all
the
confident
*NL*
assertions
of
the
lad
to
the
contrary
,
it
is
certain
they
were
no
more
*NL*
in
the
right
road
to
Coventry
,
than
the
fraudulent
,
griping
,
cruel
,
*NL*
canting
miser
is
in
the
right
road
to
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
,
perhaps
,
easy
for
a
reader
,
who
hath
never
been
in
those
*NL*
circumstances
,
to
imagine
the
horror
with
which
darkness
,
rain
,
and
*NL*
wind
,
fill
persons
who
have
lost
their
way
in
the
night
;
and
who
,
*NL*
consequently
,
have
not
the
pleasant
prospect
of
warm
fires
,
dry
*NL*
cloaths
,
and
other
refreshments
,
to
support
their
minds
in
struggling
*NL*
with
the
inclemencies
of
the
weather
.
A
very
imperfect
idea
of
this
*NL*
horror
will
,
however
,
serve
sufficiently
to
account
for
the
conceits
*NL*
which
now
filled
the
head
of
Partridge
,
and
which
we
shall
presently
*NL*
be
obliged
to
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
grew
more
and
more
positive
that
they
were
out
of
their
road
;
*NL*
and
the
boy
himself
at
last
acknowledged
he
believed
they
were
not
in
*NL*
the
right
road
to
Coventry
;
though
he
affirmed
,
at
the
same
time
,
it
*NL*
was
impossible
they
should
have
mist
the
way
.
But
Partridge
was
of
a
*NL*
different
opinion
.
He
said
,
``
When
they
first
set
out
he
imagined
some
*NL*
mischief
or
other
would
happen
.
--
Did
not
you
observe
,
sir
,
''
said
he
to
*NL*
Jones
,
``
that
old
woman
who
stood
at
the
door
just
as
you
was
taking
*NL*
horse
?
I
wish
you
had
given
her
a
small
matter
,
with
all
my
heart
;
for
*NL*
she
said
then
you
might
repent
it
;
and
at
that
very
instant
it
began
*NL*
to
rain
,
and
the
wind
hath
continued
rising
ever
since
.
Whatever
some
*NL*
people
may
think
,
I
am
very
certain
it
is
in
the
power
of
witches
to
*NL*
raise
the
wind
whenever
they
please
.
I
have
seen
it
happen
very
often
*NL*
in
my
time
:
and
if
ever
I
saw
a
witch
in
all
my
life
,
that
old
woman
*NL*
was
certainly
one
.
I
thought
so
to
myself
at
that
very
time
;
and
if
I
*NL*
had
had
any
halfpence
in
my
pocket
,
I
would
have
given
her
some
;
for
*NL*
to
be
sure
it
is
always
good
to
be
charitable
to
those
sort
of
people
,
*NL*
for
fear
what
may
happen
;
and
many
a
person
hath
lost
his
cattle
by
*NL*
saving
a
halfpenny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
though
he
was
horridly
vexed
at
the
delay
which
this
mistake
*NL*
was
likely
to
occasion
in
his
journey
,
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
*NL*
superstition
of
his
friend
,
whom
an
accident
now
greatly
confirmed
in
*NL*
his
opinion
.
This
was
a
tumble
from
his
horse
;
by
which
,
however
,
he
*NL*
received
no
other
injury
than
what
the
dirt
conferred
on
his
cloaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
had
no
sooner
recovered
his
legs
,
than
he
appealed
to
his
*NL*
fall
,
as
conclusive
evidence
of
all
he
had
asserted
;
but
Jones
finding
*NL*
he
was
unhurt
,
answered
with
a
smile
:
``
This
witch
of
yours
,
Partridge
,
*NL*
is
a
most
ungrateful
jade
,
and
doth
not
,
I
find
,
distinguish
her
*NL*
friends
from
others
in
her
resentment
.
If
the
old
lady
had
been
angry
*NL*
with
me
for
neglecting
her
,
I
do
n't
see
why
she
should
tumble
you
from
*NL*
your
horse
,
after
all
the
respect
you
have
expressed
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
ill
jesting
,
''
cries
Partridge
,
``
with
people
who
have
power
to
*NL*
do
these
things
;
for
they
are
often
very
malicious
.
I
remember
a
*NL*
farrier
,
who
provoked
one
of
them
,
by
asking
her
when
the
time
she
had
*NL*
bargained
with
the
devil
for
would
be
out
;
and
within
three
months
*NL*
from
that
very
day
one
of
his
best
cows
was
drowned
.
Nor
was
she
*NL*
satisfied
with
that
;
for
a
little
time
afterwards
he
lost
a
barrel
of
*NL*
best-drink
:
for
the
old
witch
pulled
out
the
spigot
,
and
let
it
run
*NL*
all
over
the
cellar
,
the
very
first
evening
he
had
tapped
it
to
make
*NL*
merry
with
some
of
his
neighbours
.
In
short
,
nothing
ever
thrived
with
*NL*
him
afterwards
;
for
she
worried
the
poor
man
so
,
that
he
took
to
*NL*
drinking
;
and
in
a
year
or
two
his
stock
was
seized
,
and
he
and
his
*NL*
family
are
now
come
to
the
parish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
guide
,
and
perhaps
his
horse
too
,
were
both
so
attentive
to
this
*NL*
discourse
,
that
,
either
through
want
of
care
,
or
by
the
malice
of
the
*NL*
witch
,
they
were
now
both
sprawling
in
the
dirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
entirely
imputed
this
fall
,
as
he
had
done
his
own
,
to
the
*NL*
same
cause
.
He
told
Mr
Jones
,
``
It
would
certainly
be
his
turn
next
;
*NL*
and
earnestly
entreated
him
to
return
back
,
and
find
out
the
old
*NL*
woman
,
and
pacify
her
.
We
shall
very
soon
,
''
added
he
,
``
reach
the
inn
;
*NL*
for
though
we
have
seemed
to
go
forward
,
I
am
very
certain
we
are
in
*NL*
the
identical
place
in
which
we
were
an
hour
ago
;
and
I
dare
swear
,
if
*NL*
it
was
daylight
,
we
might
now
see
the
inn
we
set
out
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instead
of
returning
any
answer
to
this
sage
advice
,
Jones
was
*NL*
entirely
attentive
to
what
had
happened
to
the
boy
,
who
received
no
*NL*
other
hurt
than
what
had
before
befallen
Partridge
,
and
which
his
*NL*
cloaths
very
easily
bore
,
as
they
had
been
for
many
years
inured
to
*NL*
the
like
.
He
soon
regained
his
side-saddle
,
and
by
the
hearty
curses
*NL*
and
blows
which
he
bestowed
on
his
horse
,
quickly
satisfied
Mr
Jones
*NL*
that
no
harm
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
xii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Relates
that
Mr
Jones
continued
his
journey
,
contrary
to
the
advice
of
*NL*
Partridge
,
with
what
happened
on
that
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
discovered
a
light
at
some
distance
,
to
the
great
pleasure
of
*NL*
Jones
,
and
to
the
no
small
terror
of
Partridge
,
who
firmly
believed
*NL*
himself
to
be
bewitched
,
and
that
this
light
was
a
Jack-with-a-lantern
,
*NL*
or
somewhat
more
mischievous
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
were
these
fears
increased
,
when
,
as
they
approached
nearer
to
*NL*
this
light
-LRB-
or
lights
as
they
now
appeared
-RRB-
,
they
heard
a
confused
*NL*
sound
of
human
voices
;
of
singing
,
laughing
,
and
hallowing
,
together
*NL*
with
a
strange
noise
that
seemed
to
proceed
from
some
instruments
;
but
*NL*
could
hardly
be
allowed
the
name
of
music
!
indeed
,
to
favour
a
little
*NL*
the
opinion
of
Partridge
,
it
might
very
well
be
called
music
*NL*
bewitched
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
much
greater
degree
of
horror
than
what
*NL*
now
seized
on
Partridge
;
the
contagion
of
which
had
reached
the
*NL*
post-boy
,
who
had
been
very
attentive
to
many
things
that
the
other
*NL*
had
uttered
.
He
now
,
therefore
,
joined
in
petitioning
Jones
to
return
;
*NL*
saying
he
firmly
believed
what
Partridge
had
just
before
said
,
that
*NL*
though
the
horses
seemed
to
go
on
,
they
had
not
moved
a
step
forwards
*NL*
during
at
least
the
last
half-hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
could
not
help
smiling
in
the
midst
of
his
vexation
,
at
the
*NL*
fears
of
these
poor
fellows
.
``
Either
we
advance
,
''
says
he
,
``
towards
*NL*
the
lights
,
or
the
lights
have
advanced
towards
us
;
for
we
are
now
at
*NL*
a
very
little
distance
from
them
;
but
how
can
either
of
you
be
afraid
*NL*
of
a
set
of
people
who
appear
only
to
be
merry-making
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merry-making
,
sir
!
''
cries
Partridge
;
``
who
could
be
merry-making
at
*NL*
this
time
of
night
,
and
in
such
a
place
,
and
such
weather
?
They
can
be
*NL*
nothing
but
ghosts
or
witches
,
or
some
evil
spirits
or
other
,
that
's
*NL*
certain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
them
be
what
they
will
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
I
am
resolved
to
go
up
to
*NL*
them
,
and
enquire
the
way
to
Coventry
.
All
witches
,
Partridge
,
are
not
*NL*
such
ill-natured
hags
as
that
we
had
the
misfortune
to
meet
with
*NL*
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Lord
,
sir
,
''
cries
Partridge
,
``
there
is
no
knowing
what
humour
they
*NL*
will
be
in
;
to
be
sure
it
is
always
best
to
be
civil
to
them
;
but
what
*NL*
if
we
should
meet
with
something
worse
than
witches
,
with
evil
spirits
*NL*
themselves
?
--
Pray
,
sir
,
be
advised
;
pray
,
sir
,
do
.
If
you
had
read
*NL*
so
many
terrible
accounts
as
I
have
of
these
matters
,
you
would
not
be
*NL*
so
fool-hardy
.
--
The
Lord
knows
whither
we
have
got
already
,
or
*NL*
whither
we
are
going
;
for
sure
such
darkness
was
never
seen
upon
*NL*
earth
,
and
I
question
whether
it
can
be
darker
in
the
other
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
put
forwards
as
fast
as
he
could
,
notwithstanding
all
these
*NL*
hints
and
cautions
,
and
poor
Partridge
was
obliged
to
follow
;
for
*NL*
though
he
hardly
dared
to
advance
,
he
dared
still
less
to
stay
behind
*NL*
by
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
they
arrived
at
the
place
whence
the
lights
and
different
*NL*
noises
had
issued
.
This
Jones
perceived
to
be
no
other
than
a
barn
,
*NL*
where
a
great
number
of
men
and
women
were
assembled
,
and
diverting
*NL*
themselves
with
much
apparent
jollity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
no
sooner
appeared
before
the
great
doors
of
the
barn
,
which
*NL*
were
open
,
than
a
masculine
and
very
rough
voice
from
within
demanded
,
*NL*
who
was
there
?
--
To
which
Jones
gently
answered
,
a
friend
;
and
*NL*
immediately
asked
the
road
to
Coventry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
a
friend
,
''
cries
another
of
the
men
in
the
barn
,
``
you
had
*NL*
better
alight
till
the
storm
is
over
''
-LRB-
for
indeed
it
was
now
more
*NL*
violent
than
ever
;-RRB-
``
you
are
very
welcome
to
put
up
your
horse
;
for
*NL*
there
is
sufficient
room
for
him
at
the
end
of
the
barn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
obliging
,
''
returned
Jones
;
``
and
I
will
accept
your
offer
*NL*
for
a
few
minutes
,
whilst
the
rain
continues
;
and
here
are
two
more
*NL*
who
will
be
glad
of
the
same
favour
.
''
This
was
accorded
with
more
*NL*
good-will
than
it
was
accepted
:
for
Partridge
would
rather
have
*NL*
submitted
to
the
utmost
inclemency
of
the
weather
than
have
trusted
to
*NL*
the
clemency
of
those
whom
he
took
for
hobgoblins
;
and
the
poor
*NL*
post-boy
was
now
infected
with
the
same
apprehensions
;
but
they
were
*NL*
both
obliged
to
follow
the
example
of
Jones
;
the
one
because
he
durst
*NL*
not
leave
his
horse
,
and
the
other
because
he
feared
nothing
so
much
*NL*
as
being
left
by
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
this
history
been
writ
in
the
days
of
superstition
,
I
should
have
*NL*
had
too
much
compassion
for
the
reader
to
have
left
him
so
long
in
*NL*
suspense
,
whether
Beelzebub
or
Satan
was
about
actually
to
appear
in
*NL*
person
,
with
all
his
hellish
retinue
;
but
as
these
doctrines
are
at
*NL*
present
very
unfortunate
,
and
have
but
few
,
if
any
believers
,
I
have
*NL*
not
been
much
aware
of
conveying
any
such
terrors
.
To
say
truth
,
the
*NL*
whole
furniture
of
the
infernal
regions
hath
long
been
appropriated
by
*NL*
the
managers
of
playhouses
,
who
seem
lately
to
have
laid
them
by
as
*NL*
rubbish
,
capable
only
of
affecting
the
upper
gallery
;
a
place
in
which
*NL*
few
of
our
readers
ever
sit
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
though
we
do
not
suspect
raising
any
great
terror
on
this
*NL*
occasion
,
we
have
reason
to
fear
some
other
apprehensions
may
here
*NL*
arise
in
our
reader
,
into
which
we
would
not
willingly
betray
him
;
I
*NL*
mean
that
we
are
going
to
take
a
voyage
into
fairy-land
,
and
introduce
*NL*
a
set
of
beings
into
our
history
,
which
scarce
any
one
was
ever
*NL*
childish
enough
to
believe
,
though
many
have
been
foolish
enough
to
*NL*
spend
their
time
in
writing
and
reading
their
adventures
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
prevent
,
therefore
,
any
such
suspicions
,
so
prejudicial
to
the
*NL*
credit
of
an
historian
,
who
professes
to
draw
his
materials
from
*NL*
nature
only
,
we
shall
now
proceed
to
acquaint
the
reader
who
these
*NL*
people
were
,
whose
sudden
appearance
had
struck
such
terrors
into
*NL*
Partridge
,
had
more
than
half
frightened
the
post-boy
,
and
had
a
*NL*
little
surprized
even
Mr
Jones
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
then
assembled
in
this
barn
were
no
other
than
a
company
of
*NL*
Egyptians
,
or
,
as
they
are
vulgarly
called
,
gypsies
,
and
they
were
now
*NL*
celebrating
the
wedding
of
one
of
their
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
happier
set
of
people
than
appeared
*NL*
here
to
be
met
together
.
The
utmost
mirth
,
indeed
,
shewed
itself
in
*NL*
every
countenance
;
nor
was
their
ball
totally
void
of
all
order
and
*NL*
decorum
.
Perhaps
it
had
more
than
a
country
assembly
is
sometimes
*NL*
conducted
with
:
for
these
people
are
subject
to
a
formal

and

of
their
own
,
and
all
pay
obedience
to
one
great
magistrate
,
*NL*
whom
they
call
their
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
Greater
plenty
,
likewise
,
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
than
what
flourished
*NL*
in
this
barn
.
Here
was
indeed
no
nicety
nor
elegance
,
nor
did
the
keen
*NL*
appetite
of
the
guests
require
any
.
Here
was
good
store
of
bacon
,
*NL*
fowls
,
and
mutton
,
to
which
every
one
present
provided
better
sauce
*NL*
himself
than
the
best
and
dearest
French
cook
can
prepare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aeneas
is
not
described
under
more
consternation
in
the
temple
of
*NL*
Juno
,
*NL*
*NL*
_
Dum

_
,
*NL*
*NL*
than
was
our
heroe
at
what
he
saw
in
this
barn
.
While
he
was
looking
*NL*
everywhere
round
him
with
astonishment
,
a
venerable
person
approached
*NL*
him
with
many
friendly
salutations
,
rather
of
too
hearty
a
kind
to
be
*NL*
called
courtly
.
This
was
no
other
than
the
king
of
the
gypsies
*NL*
himself
.
He
was
very
little
distinguished
in
dress
from
his
subjects
,
*NL*
nor
had
he
any
regalia
of
majesty
to
support
his
dignity
;
and
yet
*NL*
there
seemed
-LRB-
as
Mr
Jones
said
-RRB-
to
be
somewhat
in
his
air
which
*NL*
denoted
authority
,
and
inspired
the
beholders
with
an
idea
of
awe
and
*NL*
respect
;
though
all
this
was
perhaps
imaginary
in
Jones
;
and
the
truth
*NL*
may
be
,
that
such
ideas
are
incident
to
power
,
and
almost
inseparable
*NL*
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
somewhat
in
the
open
countenance
and
courteous
behaviour
of
*NL*
Jones
which
,
being
accompanied
with
much
comeliness
of
person
,
greatly
*NL*
recommended
him
at
first
sight
to
every
beholder
.
These
were
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
a
little
heightened
in
the
present
instance
,
by
that
profound
respect
*NL*
which
he
paid
to
the
king
of
the
gypsies
,
the
moment
he
was
acquainted
*NL*
with
his
dignity
,
and
which
was
the
sweeter
to
his
gypseian
majesty
,
*NL*
as
he
was
not
used
to
receive
such
homage
from
any
but
his
own
*NL*
subjects
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
ordered
a
table
to
be
spread
with
the
choicest
of
their
*NL*
provisions
for
his
accommodation
;
and
,
having
placed
himself
at
his
*NL*
right
hand
,
his
majesty
began
to
discourse
with
our
heroe
in
the
*NL*
following
manner
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
doubt
not
,
sir
,
but
you
have
often
seen
some
of
my
people
,
who

call

:
for
dey
go

but
me
*NL*
fancy
you

not

be
so
considrable

as
we
be
;
and
may
be
*NL*
you
will
be
surprize
more
when
you
hear
de

be
as
orderly
and
*NL*
well
govern

as
any
upon

of
de
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me

,
as
me
say
,
to
be

,
and
no

can
do

of

dutiful
subject
,
ne
no
more
affectionate

How
far

*NL*

good-will
,
me
no
say
;
but
dis
me
can
say
,
dat
me
never

but
to

Me

no

About

not

for
dere

and
*NL*
dese

about

but
de
king
of
de
*NL*
gypsy
did
demolish

all
,
and
made
all
his
subject

;
and
since

time
dey
have
agree
very
well
;
for
dey
no

and

be

be
;
for

*NL*
you
it

often

me
have
been
forced
to

never
put

our
punishments

severe

Dey

;

ave
scarce
ever
known
de
gypsy
*NL*
so

do
harm
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
king
then
proceeded
to
express
some
wonder
that
there
was
no
such
*NL*
punishment
as
shame
in
other
governments
.
Upon
which
Jones
assured
him
*NL*
to
the
contrary
;
for
that
there
were
many
crimes
for
which
shame
was
*NL*
inflicted
by
the
English
laws
,
and
that
it
was
indeed
one
consequence
*NL*
of
all
punishment
.
``
Dat
be
ver
strange
,
''
said
the
king
;
``
for
me
know
*NL*
and
hears
good
deal
of
your
people
,
dough
me
no
live
among

and
me
*NL*
have
often
hear
dat

is
de
consequence
and
de
cause
too
of
many
of
*NL*
your
rewards
.
Are
your
rewards
and
punishments
den
de
same
ting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
his
majesty
was
thus
discoursing
with
Jones
,
a
sudden
uproar
*NL*
arose
in
the
barn
,
and
as
it
seems
upon
this
occasion
:
--
the
courtesy
*NL*
of
these
people
had
by
degrees
removed
all
the
apprehensions
of
*NL*
Partridge
,
and
he
was
prevailed
upon
not
only
to
stuff
himself
with
*NL*
their
food
,
but
to
taste
some
of
their
liquors
,
which
by
degrees
*NL*
entirely
expelled
all
fear
from
his
composition
,
and
in
its
stead
*NL*
introduced
much
more
agreeable
sensations
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
female
gypsy
,
more
remarkable
for
her
wit
than
her
beauty
,
had
*NL*
decoyed
the
honest
fellow
aside
,
pretending
to
tell
his
fortune
.
Now
,
*NL*
when
they
were
alone
together
in
a
remote
part
of
the
barn
,
whether
it
*NL*
proceeded
from
the
strong
liquor
,
which
is
never
so
apt
to
inflame
*NL*
inordinate
desire
as
after
moderate
fatigue
;
or
whether
the
fair
gypsy
*NL*
herself
threw
aside
the
delicacy
and
decency
of
her
sex
,
and
tempted
*NL*
the
youth
Partridge
with
express
solicitations
;
but
they
were
*NL*
discovered
in
a
very
improper
manner
by
the
husband
of
the
gypsy
,
who
,
*NL*
from
jealousy
it
seems
,
had
kept
a
watchful
eye
over
his
wife
,
and
had
*NL*
dogged
her
to
the
place
,
where
he
found
her
in
the
arms
of
her
*NL*
gallant
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
great
confusion
of
Jones
,
Partridge
was
now
hurried
before
the
*NL*
king
;
who
heard
the
accusation
,
and
likewise
the
culprit
's
defence
,
*NL*
which
was
indeed
very
trifling
;
for
the
poor
fellow
was
confounded
by
*NL*
the
plain
evidence
which
appeared
against
him
,
and
had
very
little
to
*NL*
say
for
himself
.
His
majesty
,
then
turning
towards
Jones
,
said
,
``
Sir
,
*NL*
you
have
hear
what
dey
say
;
what
punishment
do
you
tink
your
man
*NL*
deserve
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
answered
,
``
He
was
sorry
for
what
had
happened
,
and
that
*NL*
Partridge
should
make
the
husband
all
the
amends
in
his
power
:
he
*NL*
said
,
he
had
very
little
money
about
him
at
that
time
;
''
and
,
putting
*NL*
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
offered
the
fellow
a
guinea
.
To
which
he
*NL*
immediately
answered
,
``
He
hoped
his
honour
would
not
think
of
giving
*NL*
him
less
than
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
sum
,
after
some
altercation
,
was
reduced
to
two
;
and
Jones
,
*NL*
having
stipulated
for
the
full
forgiveness
of
both
Partridge
and
the
*NL*
wife
,
was
going
to
pay
the
money
;
when
his
majesty
,
restraining
his
*NL*
hand
,
turned
to
the
witness
and
asked
him
,
``
At
what
time
he
had
*NL*
discovered
the
criminals
?
''
To
which
he
answered
,
``
That
he
had
been
*NL*
desired
by
the
husband
to
watch
the
motions
of
his
wife
from
her
first
*NL*
speaking
to
the
stranger
,
and
that
he
had
never
lost
sight
of
her
*NL*
afterwards
till
the
crime
had
been
committed
.
''
The
king
then
asked
,
*NL*
``
if
the
husband
was
with
him
all
that
time
in
his
lurking-place
?
''
To
*NL*
which
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
His
Egyptian
majesty
then
*NL*
addressed
himself
to
the
husband
as
follows
:
``
Me
be
sorry
to
see
any
*NL*
gypsy
dat
have
no
more
honour
dan
to
sell
de
honour
of
his
wife
for
*NL*
money
.
If
you
had
de
love
for
your
wife
,
you
would
have
prevented
dis
*NL*
matter
,
and
not
endeavour
to
make
her
de
whore
dat
you
might
discover
*NL*
her
.
Me
do
order
dat
you
have
no
money
given
you
,
for
you
deserve
*NL*
punishment
,
not
reward
;
me
do
order
derefore
,
dat
you
be
de
infamous
*NL*
gypsy
,
and
do
wear
pair
of
horns
upon
your
forehead
for
one
month
,
and
*NL*
dat
your
wife
be
called
de
whore
,
and
pointed
at
all
dat
time
;
for
you
*NL*
be
de
infamous
gypsy
,
but
she
be
no
less
de
infamous
whore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gypsies
immediately
proceeded
to
execute
the
sentence
,
and
left
*NL*
Jones
and
Partridge
alone
with
his
majesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
greatly
applauded
the
justice
of
the
sentence
:
upon
which
the
*NL*
king
,
turning
to
him
,
said
,
``
Me
believe
you
be
surprize
:
for
me
*NL*
suppose
you
have
ver
bad
opinion
of
my
people
;
me
suppose
you
tink
us
*NL*
all
de
tieves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
confess
,
sir
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
I
have
not
heard
so
favourable
an
*NL*
account
of
them
as
they
seem
to
deserve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
vil
tell
you
,
''
said
the
king
,
``
how
the
difference
is
between
you
*NL*
and
us
.
My
people
rob
your
people
,
and
your
people
rob
one
anoder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
afterwards
proceeded
very
gravely
to
sing
forth
the
happiness
of
*NL*
those
subjects
who
live
under
such
a
magistrate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
their
happiness
appears
to
have
been
so
compleat
,
that
we
are
*NL*
aware
lest
some
advocate
for
arbitrary
power
should
hereafter
quote
*NL*
the
case
of
those
people
,
as
an
instance
of
the
great
advantages
which
*NL*
attend
that
government
above
all
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
we
will
make
a
concession
,
which
would
not
perhaps
have
been
*NL*
expected
from
us
,
that
no
limited
form
of
government
is
capable
of
*NL*
rising
to
the
same
degree
of
perfection
,
or
of
producing
the
same
*NL*
benefits
to
society
,
with
this
.
Mankind
have
never
been
so
happy
,
as
*NL*
when
the
greatest
part
of
the
then
known
world
was
under
the
dominion
*NL*
of
a
single
master
;
and
this
state
of
their
felicity
continued
during
*NL*
the
reigns
of
five
successive
princes
.
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
This
was
the
true
aera
of
*NL*
the
golden
age
,
and
the
only
golden
age
which
ever
had
any
existence
,
*NL*
unless
in
the
warm
imaginations
of
the
poets
,
from
the
expulsion
from
*NL*
Eden
down
to
this
day
.
*NL*

-LSB-

-RSB-
Nerva
,
Trajan
,
Adrian
,
and
the
two
Antonini
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reality
,
I
know
but
of
one
solid
objection
to
absolute
monarchy
.
*NL*
The
only
defect
in
which
excellent
constitution
seems
to
be
,
the
*NL*
difficulty
of
finding
any
man
adequate
to
the
office
of
an
absolute
*NL*
monarch
:
for
this
indispensably
requires
three
qualities
very
*NL*
difficult
,
as
it
appears
from
history
,
to
be
found
in
princely
*NL*
natures
:
first
,
a
sufficient
quantity
of
moderation
in
the
prince
,
to
*NL*
be
contented
with
all
the
power
which
is
possible
for
him
to
have
.
*NL*
2ndly
,
Enough
of
wisdom
to
know
his
own
happiness
.
And
,
3rdly
,
*NL*
Goodness
sufficient
to
support
the
happiness
of
others
,
when
not
only
*NL*
compatible
with
,
but
instrumental
to
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
if
an
absolute
monarch
,
with
all
these
great
and
rare
*NL*
qualifications
,
should
be
allowed
capable
of
conferring
the
greatest
*NL*
good
on
society
;
it
must
be
surely
granted
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
*NL*
absolute
power
,
vested
in
the
hands
of
one
who
is
deficient
in
them
*NL*
all
,
is
likely
to
be
attended
with
no
less
a
degree
of
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
our
own
religion
furnishes
us
with
adequate
ideas
of
the
*NL*
blessing
,
as
well
as
curse
,
which
may
attend
absolute
power
.
The
*NL*
pictures
of
heaven
and
of
hell
will
place
a
very
lively
image
of
both
*NL*
before
our
eyes
;
for
though
the
prince
of
the
latter
can
have
no
power
*NL*
but
what
he
originally
derives
from
the
omnipotent
Sovereign
in
the
*NL*
former
,
yet
it
plainly
appears
from
Scripture
that
absolute
power
in
*NL*
his
infernal
dominions
is
granted
to
their
diabolical
ruler
.
This
is
*NL*
indeed
the
only
absolute
power
which
can
by
Scripture
be
derived
from
*NL*
heaven
.
If
,
therefore
,
the
several
tyrannies
upon
earth
can
prove
any
*NL*
title
to
a
Divine
authority
,
it
must
be
derived
from
this
original
*NL*
grant
to
the
prince
of
darkness
;
and
these
subordinate
deputations
*NL*
must
consequently
come
immediately
from
him
whose
stamp
they
so
*NL*
expressly
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
conclude
,
as
the
examples
of
all
ages
shew
us
that
mankind
in
*NL*
general
desire
power
only
to
do
harm
,
and
,
when
they
obtain
it
,
use
it
*NL*
for
no
other
purpose
;
it
is
not
consonant
with
even
the
least
degree
*NL*
of
prudence
to
hazard
an
alteration
,
where
our
hopes
are
poorly
kept
*NL*
in
countenance
by
only
two
or
three
exceptions
out
of
a
thousand
*NL*
instances
to
alarm
our
fears
.
In
this
case
it
will
be
much
wiser
to
*NL*
submit
to
a
few
inconveniencies
arising
from
the
dispassionate
*NL*
deafness
of
laws
,
than
to
remedy
them
by
applying
to
the
passionate
*NL*
open
ears
of
a
tyrant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
can
the
example
of
the
gypsies
,
though
possibly
they
may
have
long
*NL*
been
happy
under
this
form
of
government
,
be
here
urged
;
since
we
must
*NL*
remember
the
very
material
respect
in
which
they
differ
from
all
other
*NL*
people
,
and
to
which
perhaps
this
their
happiness
is
entirely
owing
,
*NL*
namely
,
that
they
have
no
false
honours
among
them
,
and
that
they
look
*NL*
on
shame
as
the
most
grievous
punishment
in
the
world
.

Chapter
xiii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dialogue
between
Jones
and
Partridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
honest
lovers
of
liberty
will
,
we
doubt
not
,
pardon
that
long
*NL*
digression
into
which
we
were
led
at
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
,
to
*NL*
prevent
our
history
from
being
applied
to
the
use
of
the
most
*NL*
pernicious
doctrine
which
priestcraft
had
ever
the
wickedness
or
the
*NL*
impudence
to
preach
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
now
proceed
with
Mr
Jones
,
who
,
when
the
storm
was
over
,
took
*NL*
leave
of
his
Egyptian
majesty
,
after
many
thanks
for
his
courteous
*NL*
behaviour
and
kind
entertainment
,
and
set
out
for
Coventry
;
to
which
*NL*
place
-LRB-
for
it
was
still
dark
-RRB-
a
gypsy
was
ordered
to
conduct
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
having
,
by
reason
of
his
deviation
,
travelled
eleven
miles
*NL*
instead
of
six
,
and
most
of
those
through
very
execrable
roads
,
where
*NL*
no
expedition
could
have
been
made
in
quest
of
a
midwife
,
did
not
*NL*
arrive
at
Coventry
till
near
twelve
.
Nor
could
he
possibly
get
again
*NL*
into
the
saddle
till
past
two
;
for
post-horses
were
now
not
easy
to
*NL*
get
;
nor
were
the
hostler
or
post-boy
in
half
so
great
a
hurry
as
*NL*
himself
,
but
chose
rather
to
imitate
the
tranquil
disposition
of
*NL*
Partridge
;
who
,
being
denied
the
nourishment
of
sleep
,
took
all
*NL*
opportunities
to
supply
its
place
with
every
other
kind
of
*NL*
nourishment
,
and
was
never
better
pleased
than
when
he
arrived
at
an
*NL*
inn
,
nor
ever
more
dissatisfied
than
when
he
was
again
forced
to
leave
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
now
travelled
post
;
we
will
follow
him
,
therefore
,
according
to
*NL*
our
custom
,
and
to
the
rules
of
Longinus
,
in
the
same
manner
.
From
*NL*
Coventry
he
arrived
at
Daventry
,
from
Daventry
at
Stratford
,
and
from
*NL*
Stratford
at
Dunstable
,
whither
he
came
the
next
day
a
little
after
*NL*
noon
,
and
within
a
few
hours
after
Sophia
had
left
it
;
and
though
he
*NL*
was
obliged
to
stay
here
longer
than
he
wished
,
while
a
smith
,
with
*NL*
great
deliberation
,
shoed
the
post-horse
he
was
to
ride
,
he
doubted
*NL*
not
but
to
overtake
his
Sophia
before
she
should
set
out
from
St
*NL*
Albans
;
at
which
place
he
concluded
,
and
very
reasonably
,
that
his
*NL*
lordship
would
stop
and
dine
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
had
he
been
right
in
this
conjecture
,
he
most
probably
would
have
*NL*
overtaken
his
angel
at
the
aforesaid
place
;
but
unluckily
my
lord
had
*NL*
appointed
a
dinner
to
be
prepared
for
him
at
his
own
house
in
London
,
*NL*
and
,
in
order
to
enable
him
to
reach
that
place
in
proper
time
,
he
had
*NL*
ordered
a
relay
of
horses
to
meet
him
at
St
Albans
.
When
Jones
*NL*
therefore
arrived
there
,
he
was
informed
that
the
coach-and-six
had
*NL*
set
out
two
hours
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
fresh
post-horses
had
been
now
ready
,
as
they
were
not
,
it
seemed
*NL*
so
apparently
impossible
to
overtake
the
coach
before
it
reached
*NL*
London
,
that
Partridge
thought
he
had
now
a
proper
opportunity
to
*NL*
remind
his
friend
of
a
matter
which
he
seemed
entirely
to
have
*NL*
forgotten
;
what
this
was
the
reader
will
guess
,
when
we
inform
him
*NL*
that
Jones
had
eat
nothing
more
than
one
poached
egg
since
he
had
left
*NL*
the
alehouse
where
he
had
first
met
the
guide
returning
from
Sophia
;
*NL*
for
with
the
gypsies
he
had
feasted
only
his
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
so
entirely
agreed
with
the
opinion
of
Mr
Partridge
,
that
*NL*
he
no
sooner
heard
the
latter
desire
his
friend
to
stay
and
dine
,
than
*NL*
he
very
readily
put
in
his
word
,
and
retracting
his
promise
before
*NL*
given
of
furnishing
the
horses
immediately
,
he
assured
Mr
Jones
he
*NL*
would
lose
no
time
in
bespeaking
a
dinner
,
which
,
he
said
,
could
be
*NL*
got
ready
sooner
than
it
was
possible
to
get
the
horses
up
from
grass
,
*NL*
and
to
prepare
them
for
their
journey
by
a
feed
of
corn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
at
length
prevailed
on
,
chiefly
by
the
latter
argument
of
*NL*
the
landlord
;
and
now
a
joint
of
mutton
was
put
down
to
the
fire
.
*NL*
While
this
was
preparing
,
Partridge
,
being
admitted
into
the
same
*NL*
apartment
with
his
friend
or
master
,
began
to
harangue
in
the
*NL*
following
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
sir
,
if
ever
man
deserved
a
young
lady
,
you
deserve
young
*NL*
Madam
Western
;
for
what
a
vast
quantity
of
love
must
a
man
have
,
to
be
*NL*
able
to
live
upon
it
without
any
other
food
,
as
you
do
?
I
am
positive
*NL*
I
have
eat
thirty
times
as
much
within
these
last
twenty-four
hours
as
*NL*
your
honour
,
and
yet
I
am
almost
famished
;
for
nothing
makes
a
man
so
*NL*
hungry
as
travelling
,
especially
in
this
cold
raw
weather
.
And
yet
I
*NL*
ca
n't
tell
how
it
is
,
but
your
honour
is
seemingly
in
perfect
good
*NL*
health
,
and
you
never
looked
better
nor
fresher
in
your
life
.
It
must
*NL*
be
certainly
love
that
you
live
upon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
very
rich
diet
too
,
Partridge
,
''
answered
Jones
.
``
But
did
not
*NL*
fortune
send
me
an
excellent
dainty
yesterday
?
Dost
thou
imagine
I
*NL*
can
not
live
more
than
twenty-four
hours
on
this
dear
pocket-book
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
,
''
cries
Partridge
,
``
there
is
enough
in
that
pocket-book
*NL*
to
purchase
many
a
good
meal
.
Fortune
sent
it
to
your
honour
very
*NL*
opportunely
for
present
use
,
as
your
honour
's
money
must
be
almost
out
*NL*
by
this
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
answered
Jones
;
``
I
hope
you
do
n't
imagine
that
I
*NL*
should
be
dishonest
enough
,
even
if
it
belonged
to
any
other
person
,
*NL*
besides
Miss
Western
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dishonest
!
''
replied
Partridge
,
``
heaven
forbid
I
should
wrong
your
*NL*
honour
so
much
!
but
where
's
the
dishonesty
in
borrowing
a
little
for
*NL*
present
spending
,
since
you
will
be
so
well
able
to
pay
the
lady
*NL*
hereafter
?
No
,
indeed
,
I
would
have
your
honour
pay
it
again
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
it
is
convenient
,
by
all
means
;
but
where
can
be
the
harm
in
making
*NL*
use
of
it
now
you
want
it
?
Indeed
,
if
it
belonged
to
a
poor
body
,
it
*NL*
would
be
another
thing
;
but
so
great
a
lady
,
to
be
sure
,
can
never
*NL*
want
it
,
especially
now
as
she
is
along
with
a
lord
,
who
,
it
ca
n't
be
*NL*
doubted
,
will
let
her
have
whatever
she
hath
need
of
.
Besides
,
if
she
*NL*
should
want
a
little
,
she
ca
n't
want
the
whole
,
therefore
I
would
give
*NL*
her
a
little
;
but
I
would
be
hanged
before
I
mentioned
the
having
*NL*
found
it
at
first
,
and
before
I
got
some
money
of
my
own
;
for
London
,
*NL*
I
have
heard
,
is
the
very
worst
of
places
to
be
in
without
money
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
if
I
had
not
known
to
whom
it
belonged
,
I
might
have
thought
*NL*
it
was
the
devil
's
money
,
and
have
been
afraid
to
use
it
;
but
as
you
*NL*
know
otherwise
,
and
came
honestly
by
it
,
it
would
be
an
affront
to
*NL*
fortune
to
part
with
it
all
again
,
at
the
very
time
when
you
want
it
*NL*
most
;
you
can
hardly
expect
she
should
ever
do
you
such
another
good
*NL*
turn
;
for
_
fortuna
nunquam
perpetuo
est
bona
_
.
You
will
do
as
you
*NL*
please
,
notwithstanding
all
I
say
;
but
for
my
part
,
I
would
be
hanged
*NL*
before
I
mentioned
a
word
of
the
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
what
I
can
see
,
Partridge
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
hanging
is
a
matter
_
non
*NL*
longe
alienum
a
Scaevolae
studiis
_
.
''
``
You
should
say
_
alienus
_
,
''
says
*NL*
Partridge
,
--
``
I
remember
the
passage
;
it
is
an
example
under
_
communis
,
*NL*
alienus
,
immunis
,
variis
casibus
serviunt
_
.
''
``
If
you
do
remember
it
,
''
*NL*
cries
Jones
,
``
I
find
you
do
n't
understand
it
;
but
I
tell
thee
,
friend
,
*NL*
in
plain
English
,
that
he
who
finds
another
's
property
,
and
wilfully
*NL*
detains
it
from
the
known
owner
,
deserves
,
_
in
foro
conscientiae
_
,
to
*NL*
be
hanged
,
no
less
than
if
he
had
stolen
it
.
And
as
for
this
very
*NL*
identical
bill
,
which
is
the
property
of
my
angel
,
and
was
once
in
her
*NL*
dear
possession
,
I
will
not
deliver
it
into
any
hands
but
her
own
,
*NL*
upon
any
consideration
whatever
,
no
,
though
I
was
as
hungry
as
thou
*NL*
art
,
and
had
no
other
means
to
satisfy
my
craving
appetite
;
this
I
*NL*
hope
to
do
before
I
sleep
;
but
if
it
should
happen
otherwise
,
I
charge
*NL*
thee
,
if
thou
would
`
st
not
incur
my
displeasure
for
ever
,
not
to
shock
*NL*
me
any
more
by
the
bare
mention
of
such
detestable
baseness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
mentioned
it
now
,
''
cries
Partridge
,
``
if
it
had
*NL*
appeared
so
to
me
;
for
I
'm
sure
I
scorn
any
wickedness
as
much
as
*NL*
another
;
but
perhaps
you
know
better
;
and
yet
I
might
have
imagined
*NL*
that
I
should
not
have
lived
so
many
years
,
and
have
taught
school
so
*NL*
long
,
without
being
able
to
distinguish
between
_
fas
et
nefas
_
;
but
it
*NL*
seems
we
are
all
to
live
and
learn
.
I
remember
my
old
schoolmaster
,
*NL*
who
was
a
prodigious
great
scholar
,
used
often
to
say
,
_
Polly
matete
*NL*
cry
town
is
my
daskalon
_
.
The
English
of
which
,
he
told
us
,
was
,
That
*NL*
a
child
may
sometimes
teach
his
grandmother
to
suck
eggs
.
I
have
lived
*NL*
to
a
fine
purpose
,
truly
,
if
I
am
to
be
taught
my
grammar
at
this
time
*NL*
of
day
.
Perhaps
,
young
gentleman
,
you
may
change
your
opinion
,
if
you
*NL*
live
to
my
years
:
for
I
remember
I
thought
myself
as
wise
when
I
was
a
*NL*
stripling
of
one
or
two
and
twenty
as
I
am
now
.
I
am
sure
I
always
*NL*
taught
_
alienus
_
,
and
my
master
read
it
so
before
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
not
many
instances
in
which
Partridge
could
provoke
Jones
,
*NL*
nor
were
there
many
in
which
Partridge
himself
could
have
been
hurried
*NL*
out
of
his
respect
.
Unluckily
,
however
,
they
had
both
hit
on
one
of
*NL*
these
.
We
have
already
seen
Partridge
could
not
bear
to
have
his
*NL*
learning
attacked
,
nor
could
Jones
bear
some
passage
or
other
in
the
*NL*
foregoing
speech
.
And
now
,
looking
upon
his
companion
with
a
*NL*
contemptuous
and
disdainful
air
-LRB-
a
thing
not
usual
with
him
-RRB-
,
he
*NL*
cried
,
``
Partridge
,
I
see
thou
art
a
conceited
old
fool
,
and
I
wish
*NL*
thou
art
not
likewise
an
old
rogue
.
Indeed
,
if
I
was
as
well
convinced
*NL*
of
the
latter
as
I
am
of
the
former
,
thou
should
`
st
travel
no
farther
*NL*
in
my
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sage
pedagogue
was
contented
with
the
vent
which
he
had
already
*NL*
given
to
his
indignation
;
and
,
as
the
vulgar
phrase
is
,
immediately
*NL*
drew
in
his
horns
.
He
said
,
he
was
sorry
he
had
uttered
anything
which
*NL*
might
give
offence
,
for
that
he
had
never
intended
it
;
but
_
Nemo
*NL*
omnibus
horis
sapit
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Jones
had
the
vices
of
a
warm
disposition
,
he
was
entirely
free
*NL*
from
those
of
a
cold
one
;
and
if
his
friends
must
have
confest
his
*NL*
temper
to
have
been
a
little
too
easily
ruffled
,
his
enemies
must
at
*NL*
the
same
time
have
confest
,
that
it
as
soon
subsided
;
nor
did
it
at
*NL*
all
resemble
the
sea
,
whose
swelling
is
more
violent
and
dangerous
*NL*
after
a
storm
is
over
than
while
the
storm
itself
subsists
.
He
*NL*
instantly
accepted
the
submission
of
Partridge
,
shook
him
by
the
hand
,
*NL*
and
with
the
most
benign
aspect
imaginable
,
said
twenty
kind
things
,
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
very
severely
condemned
himself
,
though
not
half
*NL*
so
severely
as
he
will
most
probably
be
condemned
by
many
of
our
good
*NL*
readers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
was
now
highly
comforted
,
as
his
fears
of
having
offended
*NL*
were
at
once
abolished
,
and
his
pride
completely
satisfied
by
Jones
*NL*
having
owned
himself
in
the
wrong
,
which
submission
he
instantly
*NL*
applied
to
what
had
principally
nettled
him
,
and
repeated
in
a
*NL*
muttering
voice
,
``
To
be
sure
,
sir
,
your
knowledge
may
be
superior
to
*NL*
mine
in
some
things
;
but
as
to
the
grammar
,
I
think
I
may
challenge
*NL*
any
man
living
.
I
think
,
at
least
,
I
have
that
at
my
finger
's
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
anything
could
add
to
the
satisfaction
which
the
poor
man
now

enjoyed
,
he
received
this
addition
by
the
arrival
of
an
excellent
*NL*
shoulder
of
mutton
,
that
at
this
instant
came
smoaking
to
the
table
.
*NL*
On
which
,
having
both
plentifully
feasted

they

mounted
their

What
happened
to
Mr
Jones
in
his
journey
from
St
Albans
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
got
about
two
miles
beyond
Barnet
,
and
it
was
now
the
dusk
*NL*
of
the
evening
,
when
a
genteel-looking
man
,
but
upon
a
very
shabby
*NL*
horse
,
rode
up
to
Jones
,
and
asked
him
whether
he
was
going
to
London
;
*NL*
to
which
Jones
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
The
gentleman
replied
,
``
I
*NL*
should
be
obliged
to
you
,
sir
,
if
you
will
accept
of
my
company
;
for
*NL*
it
is
very
late
,
and
I
am
a
stranger
to
the
road
.
''
Jones
readily
*NL*
complied
with
the
request
;
and
on
they
travelled
together
,
holding
*NL*
that
sort
of
discourse
which
is
usual
on
such
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
,
indeed
,
robbery
was
the
principal
topic
:
upon
which
subject
*NL*
the
stranger
expressed
great
apprehensions
;
but
Jones
declared
he
had
*NL*
very
little
to
lose
,
and
consequently
as
little
to
fear
.
Here
*NL*
Partridge
could
not
forbear
putting
in
his
word
.
``
Your
honour
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
may
think
it
a
little
,
but
I
am
sure
,
if
I
had
a
hundred-pound
*NL*
bank-note
in
my
pocket
,
as
you
have
,
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
lose
*NL*
it
;
but
,
for
my
part
,
I
never
was
less
afraid
in
my
life
;
for
we
are
*NL*
four
of
us
,
and
if
we
all
stand
by
one
another
,
the
best
man
in
*NL*
England
ca
n't
rob
us
.
Suppose
he
should
have
a
pistol
,
he
can
kill
but
*NL*
one
of
us
,
and
a
man
can
die
but
once
.
--
That
's
my
comfort
,
a
man
can
*NL*
die
but
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
reliance
on
superior
numbers
,
a
kind
of
valour
which
hath
*NL*
raised
a
certain
nation
among
the
moderns
to
a
high
pitch
of
glory
,
*NL*
there
was
another
reason
for
the
extraordinary
courage
which
Partridge
*NL*
now
discovered
;
for
he
had
at
present
as
much
of
that
quality
as
was
*NL*
in
the
power
of
liquor
to
bestow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
company
were
now
arrived
within
a
mile
of
Highgate
,
when
the
*NL*
stranger
turned
short
upon
Jones
,
and
pulling
out
a
pistol
,
demanded
*NL*
that
little
bank-note
which
Partridge
had
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
at
first
somewhat
shocked
at
this
unexpected
demand
;
*NL*
however
,
he
presently
recollected
himself
,
and
told
the
highwayman
,
*NL*
all
the
money
he
had
in
his
pocket
was
entirely
at
his
service
;
and
so
*NL*
saying
,
he
pulled
out
upwards
of
three
guineas
,
and
offered
to
deliver
*NL*
it
;
but
the
other
answered
with
an
oath
,
That
would
not
do
.
Jones
*NL*
answered
coolly
,
he
was
very
sorry
for
it
,
and
returned
the
money
into
*NL*
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
highwayman
then
threatened
,
if
he
did
not
deliver
the
bank-note
*NL*
that
moment
,
he
must
shoot
him
;
holding
his
pistol
at
the
same
time
*NL*
very
near
to
his
breast
.
Jones
instantly
caught
hold
of
the
fellow
's
*NL*
hand
,
which
trembled
so
that
he
could
scarce
hold
the
pistol
in
it
,
*NL*
and
turned
the
muzzle
from
him
.
A
struggle
then
ensued
,
in
which
the
*NL*
former
wrested
the
pistol
from
the
hand
of
his
antagonist
,
and
both
*NL*
came
from
their
horses
on
the
ground
together
,
the
highwayman
upon
his
*NL*
back
,
and
the
victorious
Jones
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
fellow
now
began
to
implore
mercy
of
the
conqueror
:
for
,
to
*NL*
say
the
truth
,
he
was
in
strength
by
no
means
a
match
for
Jones
.
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
could
have
had
no
intention
to
shoot
you
;
*NL*
for
you
will
find
the
pistol
was
not
loaded
.
This
is
the
first
robbery
*NL*
I
ever
attempted
,
and
I
have
been
driven
by
distress
to
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
,
at
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
'
distance
,
lay
*NL*
another
person
on
the
ground
,
roaring
for
mercy
in
a
much
louder
voice
*NL*
than
the
highwayman
.
This
was
no
other
than
Partridge
himself
,
who
,
*NL*
endeavouring
to
make
his
escape
from
the
engagement
,
had
been
thrown
*NL*
from
his
horse
,
and
lay
flat
on
his
face
,
not
daring
to
look
up
,
and
*NL*
expecting
every
minute
to
be
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
posture
he
lay
,
till
the
guide
,
who
was
no
otherwise
concerned
*NL*
than
for
his
horses
,
having
secured
the
stumbling
beast
,
came
up
to
*NL*
him
,
and
told
him
his
master
had
got
the
better
of
the
highwayman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
leapt
up
at
this
news
,
and
ran
back
to
the
place
where
Jones
*NL*
stood
with
his
sword
drawn
in
his
hand
to
guard
the
poor
fellow
;
which
*NL*
Partridge
no
sooner
saw
than
he
cried
out
,
``
Kill
the
villain
,
sir
,
run
*NL*
him
through
the
body
,
kill
him
this
instant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Luckily
,
however
,
for
the
poor
wretch
,
he
had
fallen
into
more
*NL*
merciful
hands
;
for
Jones
having
examined
the
pistol
,
and
found
it
to
*NL*
be
really
unloaded
,
began
to
believe
all
the
man
had
told
him
,
before
*NL*
Partridge
came
up
:
namely
,
that
he
was
a
novice
in
the
trade
,
and
that
*NL*
he
had
been
driven
to
it
by
the
distress
he
mentioned
,
the
greatest
*NL*
indeed
imaginable
,
that
of
five
hungry
children
,
and
a
wife
lying
in
*NL*
of
the
sixth
,
in
the
utmost
want
and
misery
.
The
truth
of
all
which
*NL*
the
highwayman
most
vehemently
asserted
,
and
offered
to
convince
Mr
*NL*
Jones
of
it
,
if
he
would
take
the
trouble
to
go
to
his
house
,
which
*NL*
was
not
above
two
miles
off
;
saying
,
``
That
he
desired
no
favour
,
but
*NL*
upon
condition
of
proving
all
he
had
all
alledged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
at
first
pretended
that
he
would
take
the
fellow
at
his
word
,
*NL*
and
go
with
him
,
declaring
that
his
fate
should
depend
entirely
on
the
*NL*
truth
of
his
story
.
Upon
this
the
poor
fellow
immediately
expressed
so
*NL*
much
alacrity
,
that
Jones
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
veracity
,
*NL*
and
began
now
to
entertain
sentiments
of
compassion
for
him
.
He
*NL*
returned
the
fellow
his
empty
pistol
,
advised
him
to
think
of
honester
*NL*
means
of
relieving
his
distress
,
and
gave
him
a
couple
of
guineas
for
*NL*
the
immediate
support
of
his
wife
and
his
family
;
adding
,
``
he
wished
*NL*
he
had
more
for
his
sake
,
for
the
hundred
pound
that
had
been
*NL*
mentioned
was
not
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
readers
will
probably
be
divided
in
their
opinions
concerning
this
*NL*
action
;
some
may
applaud
it
perhaps
as
an
act
of
extraordinary
*NL*
humanity
,
while
those
of
a
more
saturnine
temper
will
consider
it
as
a
*NL*
want
of
regard
to
that
justice
which
every
man
owes
his
country
.
*NL*
Partridge
certainly
saw
it
in
that
light
;
for
he
testified
much
*NL*
dissatisfaction
on
the
occasion
,
quoted
an
old
proverb
,
and
said
,
he
*NL*
should
not
wonder
if
the
rogue
attacked
them
again
before
they
reached
*NL*
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
highwayman
was
full
of
expressions
of
thankfulness
and
gratitude
.
*NL*
He
actually
dropt
tears
,
or
pretended
so
to
do
.
He
vowed
he
would
*NL*
immediately
return
home
,
and
would
never
afterwards
commit
such
a
*NL*
transgression
:
whether
he
kept
his
word
or
no
,
perhaps
may
appear
*NL*
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
travellers
having
remounted
their
horses
,
arrived
in
town
without
*NL*
encountering
any
new
mishap
.
On
the
road
much
pleasant
discourse
*NL*
passed
between
Jones
and
Partridge
,
on
the
subject
of
their
last
*NL*
adventure
:
in
which
Jones
exprest
a
great
compassion
for
those
*NL*
highwaymen
who
are
,
by
unavoidable
distress
,
driven
,
as
it
were
,
to
*NL*
such
illegal
courses
,
as
generally
bring
them
to
a
shameful
death
:
``
I
*NL*
mean
,
''
said
he
,
``
those
only
whose
highest
guilt
extends
no
farther
*NL*
than
to
robbery
,
and
who
are
never
guilty
of
cruelty
nor
insult
to
any
*NL*
person
,
which
is
a
circumstance
that
,
I
must
say
,
to
the
honour
of
our
*NL*
country
,
distinguishes
the
robbers
of
England
from
those
of
all
other
*NL*
nations
;
for
murder
is
,
amongst
those
,
almost
inseparably
incident
to
*NL*
robbery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
,
''
answered
Partridge
,
``
it
is
better
to
take
away
one
's
money
*NL*
than
one
's
life
;
and
yet
it
is
very
hard
upon
honest
men
,
that
they
*NL*
ca
n't
travel
about
their
business
without
being
in
danger
of
these
*NL*
villains
.
And
to
be
sure
it
would
be
better
that
all
rogues
were
*NL*
hanged
out
of
the
way
,
than
that
one
honest
man
should
suffer
.
For
my
*NL*
own
part
,
indeed
,
I
should
not
care
to
have
the
blood
of
any
of
them
*NL*
on
my
own
hands
;
but
it
is
very
proper
for
the
law
to
hang
them
all
.
*NL*
What
right
hath
any
man
to
take
sixpence
from
me
,
unless
I
give
it
*NL*
him
?
Is
there
any
honesty
in
such
a
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
surely
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
no
more
than
there
is
in
him
who
takes
the
*NL*
horses
out
of
another
man
's
stable
,
or
who
applies
to
his
own
use
the
*NL*
money
which
he
finds
,
when
he
knows
the
right
owner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
hints
stopt
the
mouth
of
Partridge
;
nor
did
he
open
it
again
*NL*
till
Jones
,
having
thrown
some
sarcastical
jokes
on
his
cowardice
,
he
*NL*
offered
to
excuse
himself
on
the
inequality
of
fire-arms
,
saying
,
``
A
*NL*
thousand
naked
men
are
nothing
to
one
pistol
;
for
though
it
is
true
it
*NL*
will
kill
but
one
at
a
single
discharge
,
yet
who
can
tell
but
that
one
*NL*
may
be
himself
?

Come

Tell
me
,
*NL*
that
through
thy
bounty
,
the
pratling
babes
,
whose
innocent
play
hath
*NL*
often
been
interrupted
by
my
labours
,
may
one
time
be
amply
rewarded
*NL*
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
this
ill-yoked
pair
,
this
lean
shadow
and
this
fat
substance
,
*NL*
have
prompted
me
to
write
,
whose
assistance
shall
I
invoke
to
direct
*NL*
my
pen
?
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
Genius
;
thou
gift
of
Heaven
;
without
whose
aid
in
vain
we
*NL*
struggle
against
the
stream
of
nature
.
Thou
who
dost
sow
the
generous
*NL*
seeds
which
art
nourishes
,
and
brings
to
perfection
.
Do
thou
kindly
*NL*
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
me
through
all
the
mazes
,
the
winding
*NL*
labyrinths
of
nature
.
Initiate
me
into
all
those
mysteries
which
*NL*
profane
eyes
never
beheld
.
Teach
me
,
which
to
thee
is
no
difficult
*NL*
task
,
to
know
mankind
better
than
they
know
themselves
.
Remove
that
*NL*
mist
which
dims
the
intellects
of
mortals
,
and
causes
them
to
adore
*NL*
men
for
their
art
,
or
to
detest
them
for
their
cunning
,
in
deceiving
*NL*
others
,
when
they
are
,
in
reality
,
the
objects
only
of
ridicule
,
for
*NL*
deceiving
themselves
.
Strip
off
the
thin
disguise
of
wisdom
from
*NL*
self-conceit
,
of
plenty
from
avarice
,
and
of
glory
from
ambition
.
*NL*
Come
,
thou
that
hast
inspired
thy
Aristophanes
,
thy
Lucian
,
thy
*NL*
Cervantes
,
thy
Rabelais
,
thy
Moliere
,
thy
Shakespear
,
thy
Swift
,
thy
*NL*
Marivaux
,
fill
my
pages
with
humour
;
till
mankind
learn
the
*NL*
good-nature
to
laugh
only
at
the
follies
of
others
,
and
the
humility
*NL*
to
grieve
at
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thou
,
almost
the
constant
attendant
on
true
genius
,
Humanity
,
*NL*
bring
all
thy
tender
sensations
.
If
thou
hast
already
disposed
of
them
*NL*
all
between
thy
Allen
and
thy
Lyttleton
,
steal
them
a
little
while
*NL*
from
their
bosoms
.
Not
without
these
the
tender
scene
is
painted
.
From
*NL*
these
alone
proceed
the
noble
,
disinterested
friendship
,
the
melting
*NL*
love
,
the
generous
sentiment
,
the
ardent
gratitude
,
the
soft
*NL*
compassion
,
the
candid
opinion
;
and
all
those
strong
energies
of
a
*NL*
good
mind
,
which
fill
the
moistened
eyes
with
tears
,
the
glowing
*NL*
cheeks
with
blood
,
and
swell
the
heart
with
tides
of
grief
,
joy
,
and
*NL*
benevolence
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thou
,
O
Learning
!
-LRB-
for
without
thy
assistance
nothing
pure
,
*NL*
nothing
correct
,
can
genius
produce
-RRB-
do
thou
guide
my
pen
.
Thee
in
thy
*NL*
favourite
fields
,
where
the
limpid
,
gently-rolling
Thames
washes
thy
*NL*
Etonian
banks
,
in
early
youth
I
have
worshipped
.
To
thee
,
at
thy
*NL*
birchen
altar
,
with
true
Spartan
devotion
,
I
have
sacrificed
my
blood
.
*NL*
Come
then
,
and
from
thy
vast
,
luxuriant
stores
,
in
long
antiquity
*NL*
piled
up
,
pour
forth
the
rich
profusion
.
Open
thy
Maeonian
and
thy
*NL*
Mantuan
coffers
,
with
whatever
else
includes
thy
philosophic
,
thy
*NL*
poetic
,
and
thy
historical
treasures
,
whether
with
Greek
or
Roman
*NL*
characters
thou
hast
chosen
to
inscribe
the
ponderous
chests
:
give
me
*NL*
a
while
that
key
to
all
thy
treasures
,
which
to
thy
Warburton
thou
*NL*
hast
entrusted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lastly
,
come
Experience
,
long
conversant
with
the
wise
,
the
good
,
the
*NL*
learned
,
and
the
polite
.
Nor
with
them
only
,
but
with
every
kind
of
*NL*
character
,
from
the
minister
at
his
levee
,
to
the
bailiff
in
his
*NL*
spunging-house
;
from
the
dutchess
at
her
drum
,
to
the
landlady
behind
*NL*
her
bar
.
From
thee
only
can
the
manners
of
mankind
be
known
;
to
which
*NL*
the
recluse
pedant
,
however
great
his
parts
or
extensive
his
learning
*NL*
may
be
,
hath
ever
been
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Come
all
these
,
and
more
,
if
possible
;
for
arduous
is
the
task
I
have
*NL*
undertaken
;
and
,
without
all
your
assistance
,
will
,
I
find
,
be
too
*NL*
heavy
for
me
to
support
.
But
if
you
all
smile
on
my
labours
I
hope
*NL*
still
to
bring
them
to
a
happy
conclusion

*NL*
What
befel
Mr
Jones
on
his
arrival
in
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
learned
Dr
Misaubin
used
to
say
,
that
the
proper
direction
to
him
*NL*
was
_
To
Dr
_
Misaubin
,
_
in
the
World
_
;
intimating
that
there
were
few
*NL*
people
in
it
to
whom
his
great
reputation
was
not
known
.
And
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
upon
a
very
nice
examination
into
the
matter
,
we
shall
find
that
this
*NL*
circumstance
bears
no
inconsiderable
part
among
the
many
blessings
of
*NL*
grandeur
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
happiness
of
being
known
to
posterity
,
with
the
hopes
of
*NL*
which
we
so
delighted
ourselves
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
is
the
*NL*
portion
of
few
.
To
have
the
several
elements
which
compose
our
names
,
*NL*
as
Sydenham
expresses
it
,
repeated
a
thousand
years
hence
,
is
a
gift
*NL*
beyond
the
power
of
title
and
wealth
;
and
is
scarce
to
be
purchased
,
*NL*
unless
by
the
sword
and
the
pen
.
But
to
avoid
the
scandalous
*NL*
imputation
,
while
we
yet
live
,
of
being
_
one
whom
nobody
knows
_
-LRB-
a
*NL*
scandal
,
by
the
bye
,
as
old
as
the
days
of
Homer
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
-RRB-
will
always
be
the
*NL*
envied
portion
of
those
,
who
have
a
legal
title
either
to
honour
or
*NL*
estate
.

*NL*
*NL*
From
that
figure
,
therefore
,
which
the
Irish
peer
,
who
brought
Sophia
*NL*
to
town
,
hath
already
made
in
this
history
,
the
reader
will
conclude
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
it
must
have
been
an
easy
matter
to
have
discovered
his
*NL*
house
in
London
without
knowing
the
particular
street
or
square
which
*NL*
he
inhabited
,
since
he
must
have
been
one
_
whom
everybody
knows
_
.
To
*NL*
say
the
truth
,
so
it
would
have
been
to
any
of
those
tradesmen
who
are
*NL*
accustomed
to
attend
the
regions
of
the
great
;
for
the
doors
of
the
*NL*
great
are
generally
no
less
easy
to
find
than
it
is
difficult
to
get
*NL*
entrance
into
them
.
But
Jones
,
as
well
as
Partridge
,
was
an
entire
*NL*
stranger
in
London
;
and
as
he
happened
to
arrive
first
in
a
quarter
of
*NL*
the
town
,
the
inhabitants
of
which
have
very
little
intercourse
with
*NL*
the
householders
of
Hanover
or
Grosvenor-square
-LRB-
for
he
entered
*NL*
through
Gray
's
-
inn-lane
-RRB-
,
so
he
rambled
about
some
time
before
he
*NL*
could
even
find
his
way
to
those
happy
mansions
where
fortune
*NL*
segregates
from
the
vulgar
those
magnanimous
heroes
,
the
descendants
*NL*
of
antient
Britons
,
Saxons
,
or
Danes
,
whose
ancestors
,
being
born
in
*NL*
better
days
,
by
sundry
kinds
of
merit
,
have
entailed
riches
and
honour
*NL*
on
their
posterity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
being
at
length
arrived
at
those
terrestrial
Elysian
fields
,
*NL*
would
now
soon
have
discovered
his
lordship
's
mansion
;
but
the
peer
*NL*
unluckily
quitted
his
former
house
when
he
went
for
Ireland
;
and
as
he
*NL*
was
just
entered
into
a
new
one
,
the
fame
of
his
equipage
had
not
yet
*NL*
sufficiently
blazed
in
the
neighbourhood
;
so
that
,
after
a
successless
*NL*
enquiry
till
the
clock
had
struck
eleven
,
Jones
at
last
yielded
to
the
*NL*
advice
of
Partridge
,
and
retreated
to
the
Bull
and
Gate
in
Holborn
,
*NL*
that
being
the
inn
where
he
had
first
alighted
,
and
where
he
retired
*NL*
to
enjoy
that
kind
of
repose
which
usually
attends
persons
in
his
*NL*
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
morning
he
again
set
forth
in
pursuit
of
Sophia
;
and
many
*NL*
a
weary
step
he
took
to
no
better
purpose
than
before
.
At
last
,
*NL*
whether
it
was
that
Fortune
relented
,
or
whether
it
was
no
longer
in
*NL*
her
power
to
disappoint
him
,
he
came
into
the
very
street
which
was
*NL*
honoured
by
his
lordship
's
residence
;
and
,
being
directed
to
the
*NL*
house
,
he
gave
one
gentle
rap
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
,
who
,
from
the
modesty
of
the
knock
,
had
conceived
no
high
*NL*
idea
of
the
person
approaching
,
conceived
but
little
better
from
the
*NL*
appearance
of
Mr
Jones
,
who
was
drest
in
a
suit
of
fustian
,
and
had
by
*NL*
his
side
the
weapon
formerly
purchased
of
the
serjeant
;
of
which
,
*NL*
though
the
blade
might
be
composed
of
well-tempered
steel
,
the
handle
*NL*
was
composed
only
of
brass
,
and
that
none
of
the
brightest
.
When
*NL*
Jones
,
therefore
,
enquired
after
the
young
lady
who
had
come
to
town
*NL*
with
his
lordship
,
this
fellow
answered
surlily
,
``
That
there
were
no
*NL*
ladies
there
.
''
Jones
then
desired
to
see
the
master
of
the
house
;
but
*NL*
was
informed
that
his
lordship
would
see
nobody
that
morning
.
And
upon
*NL*
growing
more
pressing
the
porter
said
,
``
he
had
positive
orders
to
let
*NL*
no
person
in
;
but
if
you
think
proper
,
''
said
he
,
``
to
leave
your
name
,
*NL*
I
will
acquaint
his
lordship
;
and
if
you
call
another
time
you
shall
*NL*
know
when
he
will
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
now
declared
,
``
that
he
had
very
particular
business
with
the
*NL*
young
lady
,
and
could
not
depart
without
seeing
her
.
''
Upon
which
the
*NL*
porter
,
with
no
very
agreeable
voice
or
aspect
,
affirmed
,
``
that
there
*NL*
was
no
young
lady
in
that
house
,
and
consequently
none
could
he
see
;
''
*NL*
adding
,
``
sure
you
are
the
strangest
man
I
ever
met
with
,
for
you
will
*NL*
not
take
an
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
often
thought
that
,
by
the
particular
description
of
Cerberus
,
*NL*
the
porter
of
hell
,
in
the
6th
Aeneid
,
Virgil
might
possibly
intend
to
*NL*
satirize
the
porters
of
the
great
men
in
his
time
;
the
picture
,
at
*NL*
least
,
resembles
those
who
have
the
honour
to
attend
at
the
doors
of
*NL*
our
great
men
.
The
porter
in
his
lodge
answers
exactly
to
Cerberus
in
*NL*
his
den
,
and
,
like
him
,
must
be
appeased
by
a
sop
before
access
can
be
*NL*
gained
to
his
master
.
Perhaps
Jones
might
have
seen
him
in
that
light
,
*NL*
and
have
recollected
the
passage
where
the
Sibyl
,
in
order
to
procure
*NL*
an
entrance
for
Aeneas
,
presents
the
keeper
of
the
Stygian
avenue
with
*NL*
such
a
sop
.
Jones
,
in
like
manner
,
now
began
to
offer
a
bribe
to
the
*NL*
human
Cerberus
,
which
a
footman
,
overhearing
,
instantly
advanced
,
and
*NL*
declared
,
``
if
Mr
Jones
would
give
him
the
sum
proposed
,
he
would
*NL*
conduct
him
to
the
lady
.
''
Jones
instantly
agreed
,
and
was
forthwith
*NL*
conducted
to
the
lodging
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
by
the
very
fellow
who
had
*NL*
attended
the
ladies
thither
the
day
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
more
aggravates
ill
success
than
the
near
approach
to
good
.
*NL*
The
gamester
,
who
loses
his
party
at
piquet
by
a
single
point
,
laments
*NL*
his
bad
luck
ten
times
as
much
as
he
who
never
came
within
a
prospect
*NL*
of
the
game
.
So
in
a
lottery
,
the
proprietors
of
the
next
numbers
to
*NL*
that
which
wins
the
great
prize
are
apt
to
account
themselves
much
*NL*
more
unfortunate
than
their
fellow-sufferers
.
In
short
,
these
kind
of
*NL*
hairbreadth
missings
of
happiness
look
like
the
insults
of
Fortune
,
*NL*
who
may
be
considered
as
thus
playing
tricks
with
us
,
and
wantonly
*NL*
diverting
herself
at
our
expense
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
who
more
than
once
already
had
experienced
this
frolicsome
*NL*
disposition
of
the
heathen
goddess
,
was
now
again
doomed
to
be
*NL*
tantalized
in
the
like
manner
;
for
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
Mrs
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
about
ten
minutes
after
the
departure
of
Sophia
.
He
now
*NL*
addressed
himself
to
the
waiting-woman
belonging
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
*NL*
who
told
him
the
disagreeable
news
that
the
lady
was
gone
,
but
could
*NL*
not
tell
him
whither
;
and
the
same
answer
he
afterwards
received
from
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
herself
.
For
as
that
lady
made
no
doubt
but
that
Mr
*NL*
Jones
was
a
person
detached
from
her
uncle
Western
,
in
pursuit
of
his
*NL*
daughter
,
so
she
was
too
generous
to
betray
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Jones
had
never
seen
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
yet
he
had
heard
that
a
*NL*
cousin
of
Sophia
was
married
to
a
gentleman
of
that
name
.
This
,
*NL*
however
,
in
the
present
tumult
of
his
mind
,
never
once
recurred
to
his
*NL*
memory
;
but
when
the
footman
,
who
had
conducted
him
from
his
*NL*
lordship
's
,
acquainted
him
with
the
great
intimacy
between
the
ladies
,
*NL*
and
with
their
calling
each
other
cousin
,
he
then
recollected
the
*NL*
story
of
the
marriage
which
he
had
formerly
heard
;
and
as
he
was
*NL*
presently
convinced
that
this
was
the
same
woman
,
he
became
more
*NL*
surprized
at
the
answer
which
he
had
received
,
and
very
earnestly
*NL*
desired
leave
to
wait
on
the
lady
herself
;
but
she
as
positively
*NL*
refused
him
that
honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
who
,
though
he
had
never
seen
a
court
,
was
better
bred
than
*NL*
most
who
frequent
it
,
was
incapable
of
any
rude
or
abrupt
behaviour
to
*NL*
a
lady
.
When
he
had
received
,
therefore
,
a
peremptory
denial
,
he
*NL*
retired
for
the
present
,
saying
to
the
waiting-woman
,
``
That
if
this
*NL*
was
an
improper
hour
to
wait
on
her
lady
,
he
would
return
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
;
and
that
he
then
hoped
to
have
the
honour
of
seeing
her

*NL*
The
civility
with
which
he
uttered
this
,
added
to
the
great
comeliness
*NL*
of
his
person
,
made
an
impression
on
the
waiting-woman
,
and
she
could
*NL*
not
help
answering
;
``
Perhaps
,
sir
,
you
may
;
''
and
,
indeed
,
she
*NL*
afterwards
said
everything
to
her
mistress
,
which
she
thought
most
*NL*
likely
to
prevail
on
her
to
admit
a
visit
from
the
handsome
young
*NL*
gentleman
;
for
so
she
called
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
very
shrewdly
suspected
that
Sophia
herself
was
now
with
her
*NL*
cousin
,
and
was
denied
to
him
;
which
he
imputed
to
her
resentment
of
*NL*
what
had
happened
at
Upton
.
Having
,
therefore
,
dispatched
Partridge
to
*NL*
procure
him
lodgings
,
he
remained
all
day
in
the
street
,
watching
the
*NL*
door
where
he
thought
his
angel
lay
concealed
;
but
no
person
did
he
*NL*
see
issue
forth
,
except
a
servant
of
the
house
,
and
in
the
evening
he
*NL*
returned
to
pay
his
visit
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
which
that
good
lady
at
*NL*
last
condescended
to
admit
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
certain
air
of
natural
gentility
,
which
it
is
neither
in
*NL*
the
power
of
dress
to
give
,
nor
to
conceal
.
Mr
Jones
,
as
hath
been
*NL*
before
hinted
,
was
possessed
of
this
in
a
very
eminent
degree
.
He
met
,
*NL*
therefore
,
with
a
reception
from
the
lady
somewhat
different
from
what
*NL*
his
apparel
seemed
to
demand
;
and
after
he
had
paid
her
his
proper
*NL*
respects
,
was
desired
to
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
not
,
I
believe
,
be
desirous
of
knowing
all
the
*NL*
particulars
of
this
conversation
,
which
ended
very
little
to
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
poor
Jones
.
For
though
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
soon
discovered
*NL*
the
lover
-LRB-
as
all
women
have
the
eyes
of
hawks
in
those
matters
-RRB-
,
yet
*NL*
she
still
thought
it
was
such
a
lover
,
as
a
generous
friend
of
the
*NL*
lady
should
not
betray
her
to
.
In
short
,
she
suspected
this
was
the
*NL*
very
Mr
Blifil
,
from
whom
Sophia
had
flown
;
and
all
the
answers
which
*NL*
she
artfully
drew
from
Jones
,
concerning
Mr
Allworthy
's
family
,
*NL*
confirmed
her
in
this
opinion
.
She
therefore
strictly
denied
any
*NL*
knowledge
concerning
the
place
whither
Sophia
was
gone
;
nor
could
*NL*
Jones
obtain
more
than
a
permission
to
wait
on
her
again
the
next
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jones
was
departed
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
communicated
her
suspicion
*NL*
concerning
Mr
Blifil
to
her
maid
;
who
answered
,
``
Sure
,
madam
,
he
is
*NL*
too
pretty
a
man
,
in
my
opinion
,
for
any
woman
in
the
world
to
run
*NL*
away
from
.
I
had
rather
fancy
it
is
Mr
Jones
.
''
--
``
Mr
Jones
!
''
said
the
*NL*
lady
,
``
what
Jones
?
''
For
Sophia
had
not
given
the
least
hint
of
any
*NL*
such
person
in
all
their
conversation
;
but
Mrs
Honour
had
been
much
*NL*
more
communicative
,
and
had
acquainted
her
sister
Abigail
with
the
*NL*
whole
history
of
Jones
,
which
this
now
again
related
to
her
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
no
sooner
received
this
information
,
than
she
*NL*
immediately
agreed
with
the
opinion
of
her
maid
;
and
,
what
is
very
*NL*
unaccountable
,
saw
charms
in
the
gallant
,
happy
lover
,
which
she
had
*NL*
overlooked
in
the
slighted
squire
.
``
Betty
,
''
says
she
,
``
you
are
*NL*
certainly
in
the
right
:
he
is
a
very
pretty
fellow
,
and
I
do
n't
wonder
*NL*
that
my
cousin
's
maid
should
tell
you
so
many
women
are
fond
of
him
.
I
*NL*
am
sorry
now
I
did
not
inform
him
where
my
cousin
was
;
and
yet
,
if
he
*NL*
be
so
terrible
a
rake
as
you
tell
me
,
it
is
a
pity
she
should
ever
see
*NL*
him
any
more
;
for
what
but
her
ruin
can
happen
from
marrying
a
rake
*NL*
and
a
beggar
against
her
father
's
consent
?
I
protest
,
if
he
be
such
a
*NL*
man
as
the
wench
described
him
to
you
,
it
is
but
an
office
of
charity
*NL*
to
keep
her
from
him
;
and
I
am
sure
it
would
be
unpardonable
in
me
to
*NL*
do
otherwise
,
who
have
tasted
so
bitterly
of
the
misfortunes
attending
*NL*
such
marriages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
a
visitor
,
which
was
no
*NL*
other
than
his
lordship
;
and
as
nothing
passed
at
this
visit
either
*NL*
new
or
extraordinary
,
or
any
ways
material
to
this
history
,
we
shall
*NL*
here
put
an
end
to
this
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
project
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
and
her
visit
to
Lady
Bellaston
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
retired
to
rest
,
her
thoughts
were
entirely
taken
*NL*
up
by
her
cousin
Sophia
and
Mr
Jones
.
She
was
,
indeed
,
a
little
*NL*
offended
with
the
former
,
for
the
disingenuity
which
she
now
*NL*
discovered
.
In
which
meditation
she
had
not
long
exercised
her
*NL*
imagination
before
the
following
conceit
suggested
itself
;
that
could
*NL*
she
possibly
become
the
means
of
preserving
Sophia
from
this
man
,
and
*NL*
of
restoring
her
to
her
father
,
she
should
,
in
all
human
probability
,
*NL*
by
so
great
a
service
to
the
family
,
reconcile
to
herself
both
her
*NL*
uncle
and
her
aunt
Western
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
was
one
of
her
most
favourite
wishes
,
so
the
hope
of
success
*NL*
seemed
so
reasonable
,
that
nothing
remained
but
to
consider
of
proper
*NL*
methods
to
accomplish
her
scheme
.
To
attempt
to
reason
the
case
with
*NL*
Sophia
did
not
appear
to
her
one
of
those
methods
:
for
as
Betty
had
*NL*
reported
from
Mrs
Honour
,
that
Sophia
had
a
violent
inclination
to
*NL*
Jones
,
she
conceived
that
to
dissuade
her
from
the
match
was
an
*NL*
endeavour
of
the
same
kind
,
as
it
would
be
very
heartily
and
earnestly
*NL*
to
entreat
a
moth
not
to
fly
into
a
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
reader
will
please
to
remember
that
the
acquaintance
which
*NL*
Sophia
had
with
Lady
Bellaston
was
contracted
at
the
house
of
Mrs
*NL*
Western
,
and
must
have
grown
at
the
very
time
when
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
*NL*
lived
with
this
latter
lady
,
he
will
want
no
information
,
that
Mrs
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
must
have
been
acquainted
with
her
likewise
.
They
were
,
*NL*
besides
,
both
equally
her
distant
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
much
consideration
,
therefore
,
she
resolved
to
go
early
in
the
*NL*
morning
to
that
lady
,
and
endeavour
to
see
her
,
unknown
to
Sophia
,
and
*NL*
to
acquaint
her
with
the
whole
affair
.
For
she
did
not
in
the
least
*NL*
doubt
,
but
that
the
prudent
lady
,
who
had
often
ridiculed
romantic
*NL*
love
,
and
indiscreet
marriages
,
in
her
conversation
,
would
very
*NL*
readily
concur
in
her
sentiments
concerning
this
match
,
and
would
lend
*NL*
her
utmost
assistance
to
prevent
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
resolution
she
accordingly
executed
;
and
the
next
morning
before
*NL*
the
sun
,
she
huddled
on
her
cloaths
,
and
at
a
very
unfashionable
,
*NL*
unseasonable
,
unvisitable
hour
,
went
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
to
whom
she
*NL*
got
access
,
without
the
least
knowledge
or
suspicion
of
Sophia
,
who
,
*NL*
though
not
asleep
,
lay
at
that
time
awake
in
her
bed
,
with
Honour
*NL*
snoring
by
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
made
many
apologies
for
an
early
,
abrupt
visit
,
at
an
*NL*
hour
when
,
she
said
,
``
she
should
not
have
thought
of
disturbing
her
*NL*
ladyship
,
but
upon
business
of
the
utmost
consequence
.
''
She
then
*NL*
opened
the
whole
affair
,
told
all
she
had
heard
from
Betty
;
and
did
*NL*
not
forget
the
visit
which
Jones
had
paid
to
herself
the
preceding
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
answered
with
a
smile
,
``
Then
you
have
seen
this
*NL*
terrible
man
,
madam
;
pray
,
is
he
so
very
fine
a
figure
as
he
is
*NL*
represented
?
for
Etoff
entertained
me
last
night
almost
two
hours
with
*NL*
him
.
The
wench
I
believe
is
in
love
with
him
by
reputation
.
''
Here
the
*NL*
reader
will
be
apt
to
wonder
;
but
the
truth
is
,
that
Mrs
Etoff
,
who
*NL*
had
the
honour
to
pin
and
unpin
the
Lady
Bellaston
,
had
received
*NL*
compleat
information
concerning
the
said
Mr
Jones
,
and
had
faithfully
*NL*
conveyed
the
same
to
her
lady
last
night
-LRB-
or
rather
that
morning
-RRB-
*NL*
while
she
was
undressing
;
on
which
accounts
she
had
been
detained
in
*NL*
her
office
above
the
space
of
an
hour
and
a
half
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
indeed
,
though
generally
well
enough
pleased
with
the
*NL*
narratives
of
Mrs
Etoff
at
those
seasons
,
gave
an
extraordinary
*NL*
attention
to
her
account
of
Jones
;
for
Honour
had
described
him
as
a
*NL*
very
handsome
fellow
,
and
Mrs
Etoff
,
in
her
hurry
,
added
so
much
to
*NL*
the
beauty
of
his
person
to
her
report
,
that
Lady
Bellaston
began
to
*NL*
conceive
him
to
be
a
kind
of
miracle
in
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curiosity
which
her
woman
had
inspired
was
now
greatly
increased
*NL*
by
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
who
spoke
as
much
in
favour
of
the
person
of
Jones
*NL*
as
she
had
before
spoken
in
dispraise
of
his
birth
,
character
,
and
*NL*
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lady
Bellaston
had
heard
the
whole
,
she
answered
gravely
,
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
this
is
a
matter
of
great
consequence
.
Nothing
can
*NL*
certainly
be
more
commendable
than
the
part
you
act
;
and
I
shall
be
*NL*
very
glad
to
have
my
share
in
the
preservation
of
a
young
lady
of
so
*NL*
much
merit
,
and
for
whom
I
have
so
much
esteem
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doth
not
your
ladyship
think
,
''
says
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
eagerly
,
``
that
it
*NL*
would
be
the
best
way
to
write
immediately
to
my
uncle
,
and
acquaint
*NL*
him
where
my
cousin
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
pondered
a
little
upon
this
,
and
thus
answered
--
``
Why
,
no
,
*NL*
madam
,
I
think
not
.
Di
Western
hath
described
her
brother
to
me
to
be
*NL*
such
a
brute
,
that
I
can
not
consent
to
put
any
woman
under
his
power
*NL*
who
hath
escaped
from
it
.
I
have
heard
he
behaved
like
a
monster
to
*NL*
his
own
wife
,
for
he
is
one
of
those
wretches
who
think
they
have
a
*NL*
right
to
tyrannise
over
us
,
and
from
such
I
shall
ever
esteem
it
the
*NL*
cause
of
my
sex
to
rescue
any
woman
who
is
so
unfortunate
to
be
under
*NL*
their
power
.
--
The
business
,
dear
cousin
,
will
be
only
to
keep
Miss
*NL*
Western
from
seeing
this
young
fellow
,
till
the
good
company
,
which
*NL*
she
will
have
an
opportunity
of
meeting
here
,
give
her
a
properer
*NL*
turn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
should
find
her
out
,
madam
,
''
answered
the
other
,
``
your
ladyship
*NL*
may
be
assured
he
will
leave
nothing
unattempted
to
come
at
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
madam
,
''
replied
the
lady
,
``
it
is
impossible
he
should
come
*NL*
here
--
though
indeed
it
is
possible
he
may
get
some
intelligence
where
*NL*
she
is
,
and
then
may
lurk
about
the
house
--
I
wish
therefore
I
knew
his
*NL*
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
no
way
,
madam
,
by
which
I
could
have
a
sight
of
him
?
for
,
*NL*
otherwise
,
you
know
,
cousin
,
she
may
contrive
to
see
him
here
without
*NL*
my
knowledge
.
''
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
answered
,
``
That
he
had
threatened
her
*NL*
with
another
visit
that
afternoon
,
and
that
,
if
her
ladyship
pleased
*NL*
to
do
her
the
honour
of
calling
upon
her
then
,
she
would
hardly
fail
*NL*
of
seeing
him
between
six
and
seven
;
and
if
he
came
earlier
she
would
,
*NL*
by
some
means
or
other
,
detain
him
till
her
ladyship
's
arrival
.
''
--
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
replied
,
``
She
would
come
the
moment
she
could
get
from
*NL*
dinner
,
which
she
supposed
would
be
by
seven
at
farthest
;
for
that
it
*NL*
was
absolutely
necessary
she
should
be
acquainted
with
his
person
.
*NL*
Upon
my
word
,
madam
,
''
says
she
,
``
it
was
very
good
to
take
this
care
of
*NL*
Miss
Western
;
but
common
humanity
,
as
well
as
regard
to
our
family
,
*NL*
requires
it
of
us
both
;
for
it
would
be
a
dreadful
match
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
failed
not
to
make
a
proper
return
to
the
compliment
*NL*
which
Lady
Bellaston
had
bestowed
on
her
cousin
,
and
,
after
some
*NL*
little
immaterial
conversation
,
withdrew
;
and
,
getting
as
fast
as
she
*NL*
could
into
her
chair
,
unseen
by
Sophia
or
Honour
,
returned
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
consists
of
visiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
had
walked
within
sight
of
a
certain
door
during
the
whole
*NL*
day
,
which
,
though
one
of
the
shortest
,
appeared
to
him
to
be
one
of
*NL*
the
longest
in
the
whole
year
.
At
length
,
the
clock
having
struck
*NL*
five
,
he
returned
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
who
,
though
it
was
a
full
hour
*NL*
earlier
than
the
decent
time
of
visiting
,
received
him
very
civilly
;
*NL*
but
still
persisted
in
her
ignorance
concerning
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
in
asking
for
his
angel
,
had
dropped
the
word
cousin
,
upon
*NL*
which
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
said
,
``
Then
,
sir
,
you
know
we
are
related
:
and
,
*NL*
as
we
are
,
you
will
permit
me
the
right
of
enquiring
into
the
*NL*
particulars
of
your
business
with
my
cousin
.
''
Here
Jones
hesitated
a
*NL*
good
while
,
and
at
last
answered
,
``
He
had
a
considerable
sum
of
money
*NL*
of
hers
in
his
hands
,
which
he
desired
to
deliver
to
her
.
''
He
then
*NL*
produced
the
pocket-book
,
and
acquainted
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
with
the
*NL*
contents
,
and
with
the
method
in
which
they
came
into
his
hands
.
He
*NL*
had
scarce
finished
his
story
,
when
a
most
violent
noise
shook
the
*NL*
whole
house
.
To
attempt
to
describe
this
noise
to
those
who
have
heard
*NL*
it
would
be
in
vain
;
and
to
aim
at
giving
any
idea
of
it
to
those
who
*NL*
have
never
heard
the
like
,
would
be
still
more
vain
:
for
it
may
be
*NL*
truly
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
_
--
Non
acuta
*NL*
Sic
geminant
Corybantes
aera
.
_
*NL*
*NL*
The
priests
of
Cybele
do
not
so
rattle
their
sounding
brass
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
a
footman
knocked
,
or
rather
thundered
,
at
the
door
.
Jones
*NL*
was
a
little
surprized
at
the
sound
,
having
never
heard
it
before
;
but
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
very
calmly
said
,
that
,
as
some
company
were
coming
,
*NL*
she
could
not
make
him
any
answer
now
;
but
if
he
pleased
to
stay
till
*NL*
they
were
gone
,
she
intimated
she
had
something
to
say
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
room
now
flew
open
,
and
,
after
pushing
in
her
hoop
*NL*
sideways
before
her
,
entered
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
having
first
made
a
*NL*
very
low
courtesy
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
and
as
low
a
one
to
Mr
Jones
,
*NL*
was
ushered
to
the
upper
end
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
mention
these
minute
matters
for
the
sake
of
some
country
ladies
of
*NL*
our
acquaintance
,
who
think
it
contrary
to
the
rules
of
modesty
to
*NL*
bend
their
knees
to
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
were
hardly
well
settled
,
before
the
arrival
of
the
peer
*NL*
lately
mentioned
,
caused
a
fresh
disturbance
,
and
a
repetition
of
*NL*
ceremonials
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
being
over
,
the
conversation
began
to
be
-LRB-
as
the
phrase
is
-RRB-
*NL*
extremely
brilliant
.
However
,
as
nothing
past
in
it
which
can
be
*NL*
thought
material
to
this
history
,
or
,
indeed
,
very
material
in
itself
,
*NL*
I
shall
omit
the
relation
;
the
rather
,
as
I
have
known
some
very
fine
*NL*
polite
conversation
grow
extremely
dull
,
when
transcribed
into
books
,
*NL*
or
repeated
on
the
stage
.
Indeed
,
this
mental
repast
is
a
dainty
,
of
*NL*
which
those
who
are
excluded
from
polite
assemblies
must
be
contented
*NL*
to
remain
as
ignorant
as
they
must
of
the
several
dainties
of
French
*NL*
cookery
,
which
are
served
only
at
the
tables
of
the
great
.
To
say
the
*NL*
truth
,
as
neither
of
these
are
adapted
to
every
taste
,
they
might
both
*NL*
be
often
thrown
away
on
the
vulgar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jones
was
rather
a
spectator
of
this
elegant
scene
,
than
an
actor
*NL*
in
it
;
for
though
,
in
the
short
interval
before
the
peer
's
arrival
,
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
first
,
and
afterwards
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
had
addressed
*NL*
some
of
their
discourse
to
him
;
yet
no
sooner
was
the
noble
lord
*NL*
entered
,
than
he
engrossed
the
whole
attention
of
the
two
ladies
to
*NL*
himself
;
and
as
he
took
no
more
notice
of
Jones
than
if
no
such
person
*NL*
had
been
present
,
unless
by
now
and
then
staring
at
him
,
the
ladies
*NL*
followed
his
example
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
had
now
staid
so
long
,
that
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
plainly
*NL*
perceived
they
all
designed
to
stay
out
each
other
.
She
therefore
*NL*
resolved
to
rid
herself
of
Jones
,
he
being
the
visitant
to
whom
she
*NL*
thought
the
least
ceremony
was
due
.
Taking
therefore
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
a
cessation
of
chat
,
she
addressed
herself
gravely
to
him
,
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
shall
not
possibly
be
able
to
give
you
an
answer
to-night
as
*NL*
to
that
business
;
but
if
you
please
to
leave
word
where
I
may
send
to
*NL*
you
to-morrow
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
natural
,
but
not
artificial
good-breeding
.
Instead
therefore
*NL*
of
communicating
the
secret
of
his
lodgings
to
a
servant
,
he
*NL*
acquainted
the
lady
herself
with
it
particularly
,
and
soon
after
very
*NL*
ceremoniously
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
no
sooner
gone
than
the
great
personages
,
who
had
taken
no
*NL*
notice
of
him
present
,
began
to
take
much
notice
of
him
in
his
*NL*
absence
;
but
if
the
reader
hath
already
excused
us
from
relating
the
*NL*
more
brilliant
part
of
this
conversation
,
he
will
surely
be
very
ready
*NL*
to
excuse
the
repetition
of
what
may
be
called
vulgar
abuse
;
though
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
it
may
be
material
to
our
history
to
mention
an
observation
*NL*
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
took
her
leave
in
a
few
minutes
after
him
,
and
*NL*
then
said
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
at
her
departure
,
``
I
am
satisfied
on
the
*NL*
account
of
my
cousin
;
she
can
be
in
no
danger
from
this
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
history
shall
follow
the
example
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
and
take
leave
*NL*
of
the
present
company
,
which
was
now
reduced
to
two
persons
;
between
*NL*
whom
,
as
nothing
passed
,
which
in
the
least
concerns
us
or
our
reader
,
*NL*
we
shall
not
suffer
ourselves
to
be
diverted
by
it
from
matters
which
*NL*
must
seem
of
more
consequence
to
all
those
who
are
at
all
interested
*NL*
in
the
affairs
of
our
heroe

Chapter
v
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
adventure
which
happened
to
Mr
Jones
at
his
lodgings
,
with
some
*NL*
account
of
a
young
gentleman
who
lodged
there
,
and
of
the
mistress
of
*NL*
the
house
,
and
her
two
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
as
early
as
it
was
decent
,
Jones
attended
at
Mrs
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
's
door
,
where
he
was
answered
that
the
lady
was
not
at
*NL*
home
;
an
answer
which
surprized
him
the
more
,
as
he
had
walked
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
in
the
street
from
break
of
day
;
and
if
she
had
*NL*
gone
out
,
he
must
have
seen
her
.
This
answer
,
however
,
he
was
obliged
*NL*
to
receive
,
and
not
only
now
,
but
to
five
several
visits
which
he
made
*NL*
her
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
plain
with
the
reader
,
the
noble
peer
had
from
some
reason
or
*NL*
other
,
perhaps
from
a
regard
for
the
lady
's
honour
,
insisted
that
she
*NL*
should
not
see
Mr
Jones
,
whom
he
looked
on
as
a
scrub
,
any
more
;
and
*NL*
the
lady
had
complied
in
making
that
promise
to
which
we
now
see
her
*NL*
so
strictly
adhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
our
gentle
reader
may
possibly
have
a
better
opinion
of
the
*NL*
young
gentleman
than
her
ladyship
,
and
may
even
have
some
concern
,
*NL*
should
it
be
apprehended
that
,
during
this
unhappy
separation
from
*NL*
Sophia
,
he
took
up
his
residence
either
at
an
inn
,
or
in
the
street
;
*NL*
we
shall
now
give
an
account
of
his
lodging
,
which
was
indeed
in
a
*NL*
very
reputable
house
,
and
in
a
very
good
part
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
,
then
,
had
often
heard
Mr
Allworthy
mention
the
gentlewoman
*NL*
at
whose
house
he
used
to
lodge
when
he
was
in
town
.
This
person
,
who
,
*NL*
as
Jones
likewise
knew
,
lived
in
Bond-street
,
was
the
widow
of
a
*NL*
clergyman
,
and
was
left
by
him
,
at
his
decease
,
in
possession
of
two
*NL*
daughters
,
and
of
a
compleat
set
of
manuscript
sermons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
these
two
daughters
,
Nancy
,
the
elder
,
was
now
arrived
at
the
age
*NL*
of
seventeen
,
and
Betty
,
the
younger
,
at
that
of
ten
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hither
Jones
had
despatched
Partridge
,
and
in
this
house
he
was
*NL*
provided
with
a
room
for
himself
in
the
second
floor
,
and
with
one
for
*NL*
Partridge
in
the
fourth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
floor
was
inhabited
by
one
of
those
young
gentlemen
,
who
,
in
*NL*
the
last
age
,
were
called
men
of
wit
and
pleasure
about
town
,
and
*NL*
properly
enough
;
for
as
men
are
usually
denominated
from
their
*NL*
business
or
profession
,
so
pleasure
may
be
said
to
have
been
the
only
*NL*
business
or
profession
of
those
gentlemen
to
whom
fortune
had
made
all
*NL*
useful
occupations
unnecessary
.
Playhouses
,
coffeehouses
,
and
taverns
*NL*
were
the
scenes
of
their
rendezvous
.
Wit
and
humour
were
the
*NL*
entertainment
of
their
looser
hours
,
and
love
was
the
business
of
*NL*
their
more
serious
moments
.
Wine
and
the
muses
conspired
to
kindle
the
*NL*
brightest
flames
in
their
breasts
;
nor
did
they
only
admire
,
but
some
*NL*
were
able
to
celebrate
the
beauty
they
admired
,
and
all
to
judge
of
*NL*
the
merit
of
such
compositions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
,
therefore
,
were
properly
called
the
men
of
wit
and
pleasure
;
but
*NL*
I
question
whether
the
same
appellation
may
,
with
the
same
propriety
,
*NL*
be
given
to
those
young
gentlemen
of
our
times
,
who
have
the
same
*NL*
ambition
to
be
distinguished
for
parts
.
Wit
certainly
they
have
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
.
To
give
them
their
due
,
they
soar
a
step
higher
*NL*
than
their
predecessors
,
and
may
be
called
men
of
wisdom
and
vertu
*NL*
-LRB-
take
heed
you
do
not
read
virtue
-RRB-
.
Thus
at
an
age
when
the
gentlemen
*NL*
above
mentioned
employ
their
time
in
toasting
the
charms
of
a
woman
,
*NL*
or
in
making
sonnets
in
her
praise
;
in
giving
their
opinion
of
a
play
*NL*
at
the
theatre
,
or
of
a
poem
at
Will
's
or
Button
's
;
these
gentlemen
*NL*
are
considering
the
methods
to
bribe
a
corporation
,
or
meditating
*NL*
speeches
for
the
House
of
Commons
,
or
rather
for
the
magazines
.
But
*NL*
the
science
of
gaming
is
that
which
above
all
others
employs
their
*NL*
thoughts
.
These
are
the
studies
of
their
graver
hours
,
while
for
their
*NL*
amusements
they
have
the
vast
circle
of
connoisseurship
,
painting
,
*NL*
music
,
statuary
,
and
natural
philosophy
,
or
rather
_
unnatural
_
,
which
*NL*
deals
in
the
wonderful
,
and
knows
nothing
of
Nature
,
except
her
*NL*
monsters
and
imperfections
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jones
had
spent
the
whole
day
in
vain
enquiries
after
Mrs
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
,
he
returned
at
last
disconsolate
to
his
apartment
.
Here
,
*NL*
while
he
was
venting
his
grief
in
private
,
he
heard
a
violent
uproar
*NL*
below-stairs
;
and
soon
after
a
female
voice
begged
him
for
heaven
's
*NL*
sake
to
come
and
prevent
murder
.
Jones
,
who
was
never
backward
on
any
*NL*
occasion
to
help
the
distressed
,
immediately
ran
down-stairs
;
when
*NL*
stepping
into
the
dining-room
,
whence
all
the
noise
issued
,
he
beheld
*NL*
the
young
gentleman
of
wisdom
and
vertu
just
before
mentioned
,
pinned
*NL*
close
to
the
wall
by
his
footman
,
and
a
young
woman
standing
by
,
*NL*
wringing
her
hands
,
and
crying
out
,
``
He
will
be
murdered
!
he
will
be
*NL*
murdered
!
''
and
,
indeed
,
the
poor
gentleman
seemed
in
some
danger
of
*NL*
being
choaked
,
when
Jones
flew
hastily
to
his
assistance
,
and
rescued
*NL*
him
,
just
as
he
was
breathing
his
last
,
from
the
unmerciful
clutches
*NL*
of
the
enemy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
fellow
had
received
several
kicks
and
cuffs
from
the
little
*NL*
gentleman
,
who
had
more
spirit
than
strength
,
he
had
made
it
a
kind
of
*NL*
scruple
of
conscience
to
strike
his
master
,
and
would
have
contented
*NL*
himself
with
only
choaking
him
;
but
towards
Jones
he
bore
no
such
*NL*
respect
;
he
no
sooner
therefore
found
himself
a
little
roughly
handled
*NL*
by
his
new
antagonist
,
than
he
gave
him
one
of
those
punches
in
the
*NL*
guts
which
,
though
the
spectators
at
Broughton
's
amphitheatre
have
*NL*
such
exquisite
delight
in
seeing
them
,
convey
but
very
little
pleasure
*NL*
in
the
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lusty
youth
had
no
sooner
received
this
blow
,
than
he
meditated
a
*NL*
most
grateful
return
;
and
now
ensued
a
combat
between
Jones
and
the
*NL*
footman
,
which
was
very
fierce
,
but
short
;
for
this
fellow
was
no
more
*NL*
able
to
contend
with
Jones
than
his
master
had
before
been
to
contend
*NL*
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
Fortune
,
according
to
her
usual
custom
,
reversed
the
face
of
*NL*
affairs
.
The
former
victor
lay
breathless
on
the
ground
,
and
the
*NL*
vanquished
gentleman
had
recovered
breath
enough
to
thank
Mr
Jones
for
*NL*
his
seasonable
assistance
;
he
received
likewise
the
hearty
thanks
of
*NL*
the
young
woman
present
,
who
was
indeed
no
other
than
Miss
Nancy
,
the
*NL*
eldest
daughter
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
footman
,
having
now
recovered
his
legs
,
shook
his
head
at
Jones
,
*NL*
and
,
with
a
sagacious
look
,
cried
--
``
O
d
--
n
me
,
I
'll
have
nothing
more
*NL*
to
do
with
you
;
you
have
been
upon
the
stage
,
or
I
'm
d
--
nably
*NL*
mistaken
.
''
And
indeed
we
may
forgive
this
his
suspicion
;
for
such
was
*NL*
the
agility
and
strength
of
our
heroe
,
that
he
was
,
perhaps
,
a
match
*NL*
for
one
of
the
first-rate
boxers
,
and
could
,
with
great
ease
,
have
*NL*
beaten
all
the
muffled
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
graduates
of
Mr
Broughton
's
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
Lest
posterity
should
be
puzzled
by
this
epithet
,
I
think
proper
*NL*
to
explain
it
by
an
advertisement
which
was
published
Feb.
1
,
1747
.
*NL*
*NL*
N.B.
--
Mr
Broughton
proposes
,
with
proper
assistance
,
to
open
an
*NL*
academy
at
his
house
in
the
Haymarket
,
for
the
instruction
of
those
*NL*
who
are
willing
to
be
initiated
in
the
mystery
of
boxing
:
where
the
*NL*
whole
theory
and
practice
of
that
truly
British
art
,
with
all
the
*NL*
various
stops
,
blows
,
cross-buttocks
,
&
c.
,
incident
to
combatants
,
*NL*
will
be
fully
taught
and
explained
;
and
that
persons
of
quality
and
*NL*
distinction
may
not
be
deterred
from
entering
into
_
A
course
of
*NL*
those
lectures
_
,
they
will
be
given
with
the
utmost
tenderness
and
*NL*
regard
to
the
delicacy
of
the
frame
and
constitution
of
the
pupil
,
*NL*
for
which
reason
muffles
are
provided
,
that
will
effectually
secure
*NL*
them
from
the
inconveniency
of
black
eyes
,
broken
jaws
,
and
bloody
*NL*
noses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
,
foaming
with
wrath
,
ordered
his
man
immediately
to
strip
,
*NL*
to
which
the
latter
very
readily
agreed
,
on
condition
of
receiving
his
*NL*
wages
.
This
condition
was
presently
complied
with
,
and
the
fellow
was
*NL*
discharged
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
young
gentleman
,
whose
name
was
Nightingale
,
very
*NL*
strenuously
insisted
that
his
deliverer
should
take
part
of
a
bottle
*NL*
of
wine
with
him
;
to
which
Jones
,
after
much
entreaty
,
consented
,
*NL*
though
more
out
of
complacence
than
inclination
;
for
the
uneasiness
of
*NL*
his
mind
fitted
him
very
little
for
conversation
at
this
time
.
Miss
*NL*
Nancy
likewise
,
who
was
the
only
female
then
in
the
house
,
her
mamma
*NL*
and
sister
being
both
gone
to
the
play
,
condescended
to
favour
them
*NL*
with
her
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
bottle
and
glasses
were
on
the
table
the
gentleman
began
to
*NL*
relate
the
occasion
of
the
preceding
disturbance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
sir
,
''
said
he
to
Jones
,
``
you
will
not
from
this
accident
*NL*
conclude
,
that
I
make
a
custom
of
striking
my
servants
,
for
I
assure
*NL*
you
this
is
the
first
time
I
have
been
guilty
of
it
in
my
remembrance
,
*NL*
and
I
have
passed
by
many
provoking
faults
in
this
very
fellow
,
before
*NL*
he
could
provoke
me
to
it
;
but
when
you
hear
what
hath
happened
this
*NL*
evening
,
you
will
,
I
believe
,
think
me
excusable
.
I
happened
to
come
*NL*
home
several
hours
before
my
usual
time
,
when
I
found
four
gentlemen
*NL*
of
the
cloth
at
whist
by
my
fire
;
--
and
my
Hoyle
,
sir
--
my
best
Hoyle
,
*NL*
which
cost
me
a
guinea
,
lying
open
on
the
table
,
with
a
quantity
of
*NL*
porter
spilt
on
one
of
the
most
material
leaves
of
the
whole
book
.
*NL*
This
,
you
will
allow
,
was
provoking
;
but
I
said
nothing
till
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
honest
company
were
gone
,
and
then
gave
the
fellow
a
gentle
*NL*
rebuke
,
who
,
instead
of
expressing
any
concern
,
made
me
a
pert
answer
,
*NL*
`
That
servants
must
have
their
diversions
as
well
as
other
people
;
*NL*
that
he
was
sorry
for
the
accident
which
had
happened
to
the
book
,
but
*NL*
that
several
of
his
acquaintance
had
bought
the
same
for
a
shilling
,
*NL*
and
that
I
might
stop
as
much
in
his
wages
,
if
I
pleased
.
'
I
now
gave
*NL*
him
a
severer
reprimand
than
before
,
when
the
rascal
had
the
insolence
*NL*
to
--
In
short
,
he
imputed
my
early
coming
home
to
--
In
short
,
he
cast
*NL*
a
reflection
--
He
mentioned
the
name
of
a
young
lady
,
in
a
manner
--
in
*NL*
such
a
manner
that
incensed
me
beyond
all
patience
,
and
,
in
my
*NL*
passion
,
I
struck
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
answered
,
``
That
he
believed
no
person
living
would
blame
him
;
*NL*
for
my
part
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
confess
I
should
,
on
the
last-mentioned
*NL*
provocation
,
have
done
the
same
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
company
had
not
sat
long
before
they
were
joined
by
the
mother
and
*NL*
daughter
,
at
their
return
from
the
play
.
And
now
they
all
spent
a
very
*NL*
chearful
evening
together
;
for
all
but
Jones
were
heartily
merry
,
and
*NL*
even
he
put
on
as
much
constrained
mirth
as
possible
.
Indeed
,
half
his
*NL*
natural
flow
of
animal
spirits
,
joined
to
the
sweetness
of
his
temper
,
*NL*
was
sufficient
to
make
a
most
amiable
companion
;
and
notwithstanding
*NL*
the
heaviness
of
his
heart
,
so
agreeable
did
he
make
himself
on
the
*NL*
present
occasion
,
that
,
at
their
breaking
up
,
the
young
gentleman
*NL*
earnestly
desired
his
further
acquaintance
.
Miss
Nancy
was
well
*NL*
pleased
with
him
;
and
the
widow
,
quite
charmed
with
her
new
lodger
,
*NL*
invited
him
,
with
the
other
,
next
morning
to
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
on
his
part
was
no
less
satisfied
.
As
for
Miss
Nancy
,
though
a
*NL*
very
little
creature
,
she
was
extremely
pretty
,
and
the
widow
had
all
*NL*
the
charms
which
can
adorn
a
woman
near
fifty
.
As
she
was
one
of
the
*NL*
most
innocent
creatures
in
the
world
,
so
she
was
one
of
the
most
*NL*
chearful
.
She
never
thought
,
nor
spoke
,
nor
wished
any
ill
,
and
had
*NL*
constantly
that
desire
of
pleasing
,
which
may
be
called
the
happiest
*NL*
of
all
desires
in
this
,
that
it
scarce
ever
fails
of
attaining
its
*NL*
ends
,
when
not
disgraced
by
affectation
.
In
short
,
though
her
power
*NL*
was
very
small
,
she
was
in
her
heart
one
of
the
warmest
friends
.
She
*NL*
had
been
a
most
affectionate
wife
,
and
was
a
most
fond
and
tender
*NL*
mother
.
As
our
history
doth
not
,
like
a
newspaper
,
give
great
*NL*
characters
to
people
who
never
were
heard
of
before
,
nor
will
ever
be
*NL*
heard
of
again
,
the
reader
may
hence
conclude
,
that
this
excellent
*NL*
woman
will
hereafter
appear
to
be
of
some
importance
in
our
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
Jones
a
little
pleased
with
the
young
gentleman
himself
,
whose
*NL*
wine
he
had
been
drinking
.
He
thought
he
discerned
in
him
much
good
*NL*
sense
,
though
a
little
too
much
tainted
with
town-foppery
;
but
what
*NL*
recommended
him
most
to
Jones
were
some
sentiments
of
great
generosity
*NL*
and
humanity
,
which
occasionally
dropt
from
him
;
and
particularly
many
*NL*
expressions
of
the
highest
disinterestedness
in
the
affair
of
love
.
On
*NL*
which
subject
the
young
gentleman
delivered
himself
in
a
language
*NL*
which
might
have
very
well
become
an
Arcadian
shepherd
of
old
,
and
*NL*
which
appeared
very
extraordinary
when
proceeding
from
the
lips
of
a
*NL*
modern
fine
gentleman
;
but
he
was
only
one
by
imitation
,
and
meant
by
*NL*
nature
for
a
much
better
character
.

*NL*
*NL*
What
arrived
while
the
company
were
at
breakfast
,
with
some
hints
*NL*
concerning
the
government
of
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Our
company
brought
together
in
the
morning
the
same
good
inclinations
*NL*
towards
each
other
,
with
which
they
had
separated
the
evening
before
;
*NL*
but
poor
Jones
was
extremely
disconsolate
;
for
he
had
just
received
*NL*
information
from
Partridge
,
that
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
had
left
her
lodging
,
*NL*
and
that
he
could
not
learn
whither
she
was
gone
.
This
news
highly
*NL*
afflicted
him
,
and
his
countenance
,
as
well
as
his
behaviour
,
in
*NL*
defiance
of
all
his
endeavours
to
the
contrary
,
betrayed
manifest
*NL*
indications
of
a
disordered
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
discourse
turned
at
present
,
as
before
,
on
love
;
and
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
again
expressed
many
of
those
warm
,
generous
,
and
*NL*
disinterested
sentiments
upon
this
subject
,
which
wise
and
sober
men
*NL*
call
romantic
,
but
which
wise
and
sober
women
generally
regard
in
a
*NL*
better
light
.
Mrs
Miller
-LRB-
for
so
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
called
-RRB-
*NL*
greatly
approved
these
sentiments
;
but
when
the
young
gentleman
*NL*
appealed
to
Miss
Nancy
,
she
answered
only
,
``
That
she
believed
the
*NL*
gentleman
who
had
spoke
the
least
was
capable
of
feeling
most
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
compliment
was
so
apparently
directed
to
Jones
,
that
we
should
*NL*
have
been
sorry
had
he
passed
it
by
unregarded
.
He
made
her
indeed
a
*NL*
very
polite
answer
,
and
concluded
with
an
oblique
hint
,
that
her
own
*NL*
silence
subjected
her
to
a
suspicion
of
the
same
kind
:
for
indeed
she
*NL*
had
scarce
opened
her
lips
either
now
or
the
last
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
,
Nanny
,
''
says
Mrs
Miller
,
``
the
gentleman
hath
made
the
*NL*
observation
;
I
protest
I
am
almost
of
his
opinion
.
What
can
be
the
*NL*
matter
with
you
,
child
?
I
never
saw
such
an
alteration
.
What
is
become
*NL*
of
all
your
gaiety
?
Would
you
think
,
sir
,
I
used
to
call
her
my
little
*NL*
prattler
?
She
hath
not
spoke
twenty
words
this
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
their
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
*NL*
maid-servant
,
who
brought
a
bundle
in
her
hand
,
which
,
she
said
,
``
was
*NL*
delivered
by
a
porter
for
Mr
Jones
.
''
She
added
,
``
That
the
man
*NL*
immediately
went
away
,
saying
,
it
required
no
answer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
expressed
some
surprize
on
this
occasion
,
and
declared
it
must
*NL*
be
some
mistake
;
but
the
maid
persisting
that
she
was
certain
of
the
*NL*
name
,
all
the
women
were
desirous
of
having
the
bundle
immediately
*NL*
opened
;
which
operation
was
at
length
performed
by
little
Betsy
,
with
*NL*
the
consent
of
Mr
Jones
:
and
the
contents
were
found
to
be
a
domino
,
a
*NL*
mask
,
and
a
masquerade
ticket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
now
more
positive
than
ever
in
asserting
,
that
these
things
*NL*
must
have
been
delivered
by
mistake
;
and
Mrs
Miller
herself
expressed
*NL*
some
doubt
,
and
said
,
``
She
knew
not
what
to
think
.
''
But
when
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
was
asked
,
he
delivered
a
very
different
opinion
.
``
All
I
*NL*
can
conclude
from
it
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
,
that
you
are
a
very
happy
*NL*
man
;
for
I
make
no
doubt
but
these
were
sent
you
by
some
lady
whom
you
*NL*
will
have
the
happiness
of
meeting
at
the
masquerade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
not
a
sufficient
degree
of
vanity
to
entertain
any
such
*NL*
flattering
imagination
;
nor
did
Mrs
Miller
herself
give
much
assent
to
*NL*
what
Mr
Nightingale
had
said
,
till
Miss
Nancy
having
lifted
up
the
*NL*
domino
,
a
card
dropt
from
the
sleeve
,
in
which
was
written
as
*NL*
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
To
MR
JONES
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
of
the
fairies
sends
you
this
;
*NL*
Use
her
favours
not
amiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
and
Miss
Nancy
now
both
agreed
with
Mr
Nightingale
;
nay
,
*NL*
Jones
himself
was
almost
persuaded
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
And
as
*NL*
no
other
lady
but
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
he
thought
,
knew
his
lodging
,
he
*NL*
began
to
flatter
himself
with
some
hopes
,
that
it
came
from
her
,
and
*NL*
that
he
might
possibly
see
his
Sophia
.
These
hopes
had
surely
very
*NL*
little
foundation
;
but
as
the
conduct
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
in
not
*NL*
seeing
him
according
to
her
promise
,
and
in
quitting
her
lodgings
,
had
*NL*
been
very
odd
and
unaccountable
,
he
conceived
some
faint
hopes
,
that
*NL*
she
-LRB-
of
whom
he
had
formerly
heard
a
very
whimsical
character
-RRB-
might
*NL*
possibly
intend
to
do
him
that
service
in
a
strange
manner
,
which
she
*NL*
declined
doing
by
more
ordinary
methods
.
To
say
the
truth
,
as
nothing
*NL*
certain
could
be
concluded
from
so
odd
and
uncommon
an
incident
,
he
*NL*
had
the
greater
latitude
to
draw
what
imaginary
conclusions
from
it
he
*NL*
pleased
.
As
his
temper
therefore
was
naturally
sanguine
,
he
indulged
*NL*
it
on
this
occasion
,
and
his
imagination
worked
up
a
thousand
*NL*
conceits
,
to
favour
and
support
his
expectations
of
meeting
his
dear
*NL*
Sophia
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reader
,
if
thou
hast
any
good
wishes
towards
me
,
I
will
fully
repay
*NL*
them
by
wishing
thee
to
be
possessed
of
this
sanguine
disposition
of
*NL*
mind
;
since
,
after
having
read
much
and
considered
long
on
that
*NL*
subject
of
happiness
which
hath
employed
so
many
great
pens
,
I
am
*NL*
almost
inclined
to
fix
it
in
the
possession
of
this
temper
;
which
puts
*NL*
us
,
in
a
manner
,
out
of
the
reach
of
Fortune
,
and
makes
us
happy
*NL*
without
her
assistance
.
Indeed
,
the
sensations
of
pleasure
it
gives
*NL*
are
much
more
constant
as
well
as
much
keener
,
than
those
which
that
*NL*
blind
lady
bestows
;
nature
having
wisely
contrived
,
that
some
satiety
*NL*
and
languor
should
be
annexed
to
all
our
real
enjoyments
,
lest
we
*NL*
should
be
so
taken
up
by
them
,
as
to
be
stopt
from
further
pursuits
.
I
*NL*
make
no
manner
of
doubt
but
that
,
in
this
light
,
we
may
see
the
*NL*
imaginary
future
chancellor
just
called
to
the
bar
,
the
archbishop
in
*NL*
crape
,
and
the
prime
minister
at
the
tail
of
an
opposition
,
more
truly
*NL*
happy
than
those
who
are
invested
with
all
the
power
and
profit
of
*NL*
those
respective
offices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
having
now
determined
to
go
to
the
masquerade
that
evening
,
*NL*
Mr
Nightingale
offered
to
conduct
him
thither
.
The
young
gentleman
,
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
offered
tickets
to
Miss
Nancy
and
her
mother
;
but
the
*NL*
good
woman
would
not
accept
them
.
She
said
,
``
she
did
not
conceive
the
*NL*
harm
which
some
people
imagined
in
a
masquerade
;
but
that
such
*NL*
extravagant
diversions
were
proper
only
for
persons
of
quality
and
*NL*
fortune
,
and
not
for
young
women
who
were
to
get
their
living
,
and
*NL*
could
,
at
best
,
hope
to
be
married
to
a
good
tradesman
.
''
--
``
A
*NL*
tradesman
!
''
cries
Nightingale
,
``
you
sha
n't
undervalue
my
Nancy
.
There
*NL*
is
not
a
nobleman
upon
earth
above
her
merit
.
''
``
O
fie
!
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
,
''
answered
Mrs
Miller
,
``
you
must
not
fill
the
girl
's
head
*NL*
with
such
fancies
:
but
if
it
was
her
good
luck
''
-LRB-
says
the
mother
with
*NL*
a
simper
-RRB-
``
to
find
a
gentleman
of
your
generous
way
of
thinking
,
I
*NL*
hope
she
would
make
a
better
return
to
his
generosity
than
to
give
her
*NL*
mind
up
to
extravagant
pleasures
.
Indeed
,
where
young
ladies
bring
*NL*
great
fortunes
themselves
,
they
have
some
right
to
insist
on
spending
*NL*
what
is
their
own
;
and
on
that
account
I
have
heard
the
gentlemen
say
,
*NL*
a
man
has
sometimes
a
better
bargain
with
a
poor
wife
,
than
with
a
*NL*
rich
one
.
--
But
let
my
daughters
marry
whom
they
will
,
I
shall
*NL*
endeavour
to
make
them
blessings
to
their
husbands
:
--
I
beg
,
*NL*
therefore
,
I
may
hear
of
no
more
masquerades
.
Nancy
is
,
I
am
certain
,
*NL*
too
good
a
girl
to
desire
to
go
;
for
she
must
remember
when
you
*NL*
carried
her
thither
last
year
,
it
almost
turned
her
head
;
and
she
did
*NL*
not
return
to
herself
,
or
to
her
needle
,
in
a
month
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
a
gentle
sigh
,
which
stole
from
the
bosom
of
Nancy
,
seemed
to
*NL*
argue
some
secret
disapprobation
of
these
sentiments
,
she
did
not
dare
*NL*
openly
to
oppose
them
.
For
as
this
good
woman
had
all
the
tenderness
,
*NL*
so
she
had
preserved
all
the
authority
of
a
parent
;
and
as
her
*NL*
indulgence
to
the
desires
of
her
children
was
restrained
only
by
her
*NL*
fears
for
their
safety
and
future
welfare
,
so
she
never
suffered
those
*NL*
commands
which
proceeded
from
such
fears
to
be
either
disobeyed
or
*NL*
disputed
.
And
this
the
young
gentleman
,
who
had
lodged
two
years
in
*NL*
the
house
,
knew
so
well
,
that
he
presently
acquiesced
in
the
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Nightingale
,
who
grew
every
minute
fonder
of
Jones
,
was
very
*NL*
desirous
of
his
company
that
day
to
dinner
at
the
tavern
,
where
he
*NL*
offered
to
introduce
him
to
some
of
his
acquaintance
;
but
Jones
begged
*NL*
to
be
excused
,
``
as
his
cloaths
,
''
he
said
,
``
were
not
yet
come
to
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
confess
the
truth
,
Mr
Jones
was
now
in
a
situation
,
which
sometimes
*NL*
happens
to
be
the
case
of
young
gentlemen
of
much
better
figure
than
*NL*
himself
.
In
short
,
he
had
not
one
penny
in
his
pocket
;
a
situation
in
*NL*
much
greater
credit
among
the
antient
philosophers
than
among
the
*NL*
modern
wise
men
who
live
in
Lombard-street
,
or
those
who
frequent
*NL*
White
's
chocolate-house
.
And
,
perhaps
,
the
great
honours
which
those
*NL*
philosophers
have
ascribed
to
an
empty
pocket
may
be
one
of
the
*NL*
reasons
of
that
high
contempt
in
which
they
are
held
in
the
aforesaid
*NL*
street
and
chocolate-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
if
the
antient
opinion
,
that
men
might
live
very
comfortably
on
*NL*
virtue
only
,
be
,
as
the
modern
wise
men
just
above-mentioned
pretend
*NL*
to
have
discovered
,
a
notorious
error
;
no
less
false
is
,
I
apprehend
,
*NL*
that
position
of
some
writers
of
romance
,
that
a
man
can
live
*NL*
altogether
on
love
;
for
however
delicious
repasts
this
may
afford
to
*NL*
some
of
our
senses
or
appetites
,
it
is
most
certain
it
can
afford
none
*NL*
to
others
.
Those
,
therefore
,
who
have
placed
too
great
a
confidence
in
*NL*
such
writers
,
have
experienced
their
error
when
it
was
too
late
;
and
*NL*
have
found
that
love
was
no
more
capable
of
allaying
hunger
,
than
a
*NL*
rose
is
capable
of
delighting
the
ear
,
or
a
violin
of
gratifying
the
*NL*
smell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
,
therefore
,
all
the
delicacies
which
love
had
set
*NL*
before
him
,
namely
,
the
hopes
of
seeing
Sophia
at
the
masquerade
;
on
*NL*
which
,
however
ill-founded
his
imagination
might
be
,
he
had
*NL*
voluptuously
feasted
during
the
whole
day
,
the
evening
no
sooner
came
*NL*
than
Mr
Jones
began
to
languish
for
some
food
of
a
grosser
kind
.
*NL*
Partridge
discovered
this
by
intuition
,
and
took
the
occasion
to
give
*NL*
some
oblique
hints
concerning
the
bank-bill
;
and
,
when
these
were
*NL*
rejected
with
disdain
,
he
collected
courage
enough
once
more
to
*NL*
mention
a
return
to
Mr
Allworthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Partridge
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
you
can
not
see
my
fortune
in
a
more
*NL*
desperate
light
than
I
see
it
myself
;
and
I
begin
heartily
to
repent
*NL*
that
I
suffered
you
to
leave
a
place
where
you
was
settled
,
and
to
*NL*
follow
me
.
However
,
I
insist
now
on
your
returning
home
;
and
for
the
*NL*
expense
and
trouble
which
you
have
so
kindly
put
yourself
to
on
my
*NL*
account
,
all
the
cloaths
I
left
behind
in
your
care
I
desire
you
would
*NL*
take
as
your
own
.
I
am
sorry
I
can
make
you
no
other
acknowledgment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
these
words
with
so
pathetic
an
accent
,
that
Partridge
,
among
*NL*
whose
vices
ill-nature
or
hardness
of
heart
were
not
numbered
,
burst
*NL*
into
tears
;
and
after
swearing
he
would
not
quit
him
in
his
distress
,
*NL*
he
began
with
the
most
earnest
entreaties
to
urge
his
return
home
.
*NL*
``
For
heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
''
says
he
,
``
do
but
consider
;
what
can
your
*NL*
honour
do
?
--
how
is
it
possible
you
can
live
in
this
town
without
*NL*
money
?
Do
what
you
will
,
sir
,
or
go
wherever
you
please
,
I
am
resolved
*NL*
not
to
desert
you
.
But
pray
,
sir
,
consider
--
do
pray
,
sir
,
for
your
own
*NL*
sake
,
take
it
into
your
consideration
;
and
I
'm
sure
,
''
says
he
,
``
that
*NL*
your
own
good
sense
will
bid
you
return
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
often
shall
I
tell
thee
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
that
I
have
no
home
to
*NL*
return
to
?
Had
I
any
hopes
that
Mr
Allworthy
's
doors
would
be
open
to
*NL*
receive
me
,
I
want
no
distress
to
urge
me
--
nay
,
there
is
no
other
*NL*
cause
upon
earth
,
which
could
detain
me
a
moment
from
flying
to
his
*NL*
presence
;
but
,
alas
!
that
I
am
for
ever
banished
from
.
His
last
words
*NL*
were
--
O
,
Partridge
,
they
still
ring
in
my
ears
--
his
last
words
were
,
*NL*
when
he
gave
me
a
sum
of
money
--
what
it
was
I
know
not
,
but
*NL*
considerable
I
'm
sure
it
was
--
his
last
words
were
--
`
I
am
resolved
from
*NL*
this
day
forward
,
on
no
account
to
converse
with
you
any
more
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
passion
stopt
the
mouth
of
Jones
,
as
surprize
for
a
moment
did
*NL*
that
of
Partridge
;
but
he
soon
recovered
the
use
of
speech
,
and
after
*NL*
a
short
preface
,
in
which
he
declared
he
had
no
inquisitiveness
in
his
*NL*
temper
,
enquired
what
Jones
meant
by
a
considerable
sum
--
he
knew
not
*NL*
how
much
--
and
what
was
become
of
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
both
these
points
he
now
received
full
satisfaction
;
on
which
he
*NL*
was
proceeding
to
comment
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
message
from
*NL*
Mr
Nightingale
,
who
desired
his
master
's
company
in
his
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
two
gentlemen
were
both
attired
for
the
masquerade
,
and
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
had
given
orders
for
chairs
to
be
sent
for
,
a
circumstance
*NL*
of
distress
occurred
to
Jones
,
which
will
appear
very
ridiculous
to
*NL*
many
of
my
readers
.
This
was
how
to
procure
a
shilling
;
but
if
such
*NL*
readers
will
reflect
a
little
on
what
they
have
themselves
felt
from
*NL*
the
want
of
a
thousand
pounds
,
or
,
perhaps
,
of
ten
or
twenty
,
to
*NL*
execute
a
favourite
scheme
,
they
will
have
a
perfect
idea
of
what
Mr
*NL*
Jones
felt
on
this
occasion
.
For
this
sum
,
therefore
,
he
applied
to
*NL*
Partridge
,
which
was
the
first
he
had
permitted
him
to
advance
,
and
*NL*
was
the
last
he
intended
that
poor
fellow
should
advance
in
his
*NL*
service
.
To
say
the
truth
,
Partridge
had
lately
made
no
offer
of
this
*NL*
kind
.
Whether
it
was
that
he
desired
to
see
the
bank-bill
broke
in
*NL*
upon
,
or
that
distress
should
prevail
on
Jones
to
return
home
,
or
from
*NL*
what
other
motive
it
proceeded
,
I
will
not
determine
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
the
whole
humours
of
a
masquerade
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Our
cavaliers
now
arrived
at
that
temple
,
where
Heydegger
,
the
great
*NL*
Arbiter
Deliciarum
,
the
great
high-priest
of
pleasure
,
presides
;
and
,
*NL*
like
other
heathen
priests
,
imposes
on
his
votaries
by
the
pretended
*NL*
presence
of
the
deity
,
when
in
reality
no
such
deity
is
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Nightingale
,
having
taken
a
turn
or
two
with
his
companion
,
soon
*NL*
left
him
,
and
walked
off
with
a
female
,
saying
,
``
Now
you
are
here
,
*NL*
sir
,
you
must
beat
about
for
your
own
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
began
to
entertain
strong
hopes
that
his
Sophia
was
present
;
and
*NL*
these
hopes
gave
him
more
spirits
than
the
lights
,
the
music
,
and
the
*NL*
company
;
though
these
are
pretty
strong
antidotes
against
the
spleen
.
*NL*
He
now
accosted
every
woman
he
saw
,
whose
stature
,
shape
,
or
air
,
bore
*NL*
any
resemblance
to
his
angel
.
To
all
of
whom
he
endeavoured
to
say
*NL*
something
smart
,
in
order
to
engage
an
answer
,
by
which
he
might
*NL*
discover
that
voice
which
he
thought
it
impossible
he
should
mistake
.
*NL*
Some
of
these
answered
by
a
question
,
in
a
squeaking
voice
,
Do
you
*NL*
know
me
?
Much
the
greater
number
said
,
I
do
n't
know
you
,
sir
,
and
*NL*
nothing
more
.
Some
called
him
an
impertinent
fellow
;
some
made
him
no
*NL*
answer
at
all
;
some
said
,
Indeed
I
do
n't
know
your
voice
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
;
and
many
gave
him
as
kind
answers
as
he
*NL*
could
wish
,
but
not
in
the
voice
he
desired
to
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
he
was
talking
with
one
of
these
last
-LRB-
who
was
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
a
shepherdess
-RRB-
a
lady
in
a
domino
came
up
to
him
,
and
slapping
him
on
*NL*
the
shoulder
,
whispered
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
in
the
ear
,
``
If
you
*NL*
talk
any
longer
with
that
trollop
,
I
will
acquaint
Miss
Western
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
no
sooner
heard
that
name
,
than
,
immediately
quitting
his
former
*NL*
companion
,
he
applied
to
the
domino
,
begging
and
entreating
her
to
*NL*
show
him
the
lady
she
had
mentioned
,
if
she
was
then
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mask
walked
hastily
to
the
upper
end
of
the
innermost
apartment
*NL*
before
she
spoke
;
and
then
,
instead
of
answering
him
,
sat
down
,
and
*NL*
declared
she
was
tired
.
Jones
sat
down
by
her
,
and
still
persisted
in
*NL*
his
entreaties
;
at
last
the
lady
coldly
answered
,
``
I
imagined
Mr
Jones
*NL*
had
been
a
more
discerning
lover
,
than
to
suffer
any
disguise
to
*NL*
conceal
his
mistress
from
him
.
''
``
Is
she
here
,
then
,
madam
?
''
replied
*NL*
Jones
,
with
some
vehemence
.
Upon
which
the
lady
cried
--
``
Hush
,
sir
,
you
*NL*
will
be
observed
.
I
promise
you
,
upon
my
honour
,
Miss
Western
is
not
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
now
taking
the
mask
by
the
hand
,
fell
to
entreating
her
in
the
*NL*
most
earnest
manner
,
to
acquaint
him
where
he
might
find
Sophia
;
and
*NL*
when
he
could
obtain
no
direct
answer
,
he
began
to
upbraid
her
gently
*NL*
for
having
disappointed
him
the
day
before
;
and
concluded
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
my
good
fairy
queen
,
I
know
your
majesty
very
well
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
affected
disguise
of
your
voice
.
Indeed
,
Mrs
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
,
it
is
a
little
cruel
to
divert
yourself
at
the
expense
of
*NL*
my
torments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mask
answered
,
``
Though
you
have
so
ingeniously
discovered
me
,
I
*NL*
must
still
speak
in
the
same
voice
,
lest
I
should
be
known
by
others
.
*NL*
And
do
you
think
,
good
sir
,
that
I
have
no
greater
regard
for
my
*NL*
cousin
,
than
to
assist
in
carrying
on
an
affair
between
you
two
,
which
*NL*
must
end
in
her
ruin
,
as
well
as
your
own
?
Besides
,
I
promise
you
,
my
*NL*
cousin
is
not
mad
enough
to
consent
to
her
own
destruction
,
if
you
are
*NL*
so
much
her
enemy
as
to
tempt
her
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
,
madam
!
''
said
Jones
,
``
you
little
know
my
heart
,
when
you
call
me
*NL*
an
enemy
of
Sophia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
to
ruin
any
one
,
''
cries
the
other
,
``
you
will
allow
,
is
the
*NL*
act
of
an
enemy
;
and
when
by
the
same
act
you
must
knowingly
and
*NL*
certainly
bring
ruin
on
yourself
,
is
it
not
folly
or
madness
,
as
well
*NL*
as
guilt
?
Now
,
sir
,
my
cousin
hath
very
little
more
than
her
father
*NL*
will
please
to
give
her
;
very
little
for
one
of
her
fashion
--
you
know
*NL*
him
,
and
you
know
your
own
situation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
vowed
he
had
no
such
design
on
Sophia
,
``
That
he
would
rather
*NL*
suffer
the
most
violent
of
deaths
than
sacrifice
her
interest
to
his
*NL*
desires
.
''
He
said
,
``
he
knew
how
unworthy
he
was
of
her
,
every
way
,
*NL*
that
he
had
long
ago
resolved
to
quit
all
such
aspiring
thoughts
,
but
*NL*
that
some
strange
accidents
had
made
him
desirous
to
see
her
once
*NL*
more
,
when
he
promised
he
would
take
leave
of
her
for
ever

No
,
*NL*
madam
,
''
concluded
he
,
``
my
love
is
not
of
that
base
kind
which
seeks
*NL*
its
own
satisfaction
at
the
expense
of
what
is
most
dear
to
its
*NL*
object
.
I
would
sacrifice
everything
to
the
possession
of
my
Sophia
,
*NL*
but
Sophia
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
reader
may
have
already
conceived
no
very
sublime
idea
of
*NL*
the
virtue
of
the
lady
in
the
mask
;
and
though
possibly
she
may
*NL*
hereafter
appear
not
to
deserve
one
of
the
first
characters
of
her
*NL*
sex
;
yet
,
it
is
certain
,
these
generous
sentiments
made
a
strong
*NL*
impression
upon
her
,
and
greatly
added
to
the
affection
she
had
before
*NL*
conceived
for
our
young
heroe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
now
,
after
silence
of
a
few
moments
,
said
,
``
She
did
not
see
*NL*
his
pretensions
to
Sophia
so
much
in
the
light
of
presumption
,
as
of
*NL*
imprudence
.
Young
fellows
,
''
says
she
,
``
can
never
have
too
aspiring
*NL*
thoughts
.
I
love
ambition
in
a
young
man
,
and
I
would
have
you
*NL*
cultivate
it
as
much
as
possible
.
Perhaps
you
may
succeed
with
those
*NL*
who
are
infinitely
superior
in
fortune
;
nay
,
I
am
convinced
there
are
*NL*
women
--
but
do
n't
you
think
me
a
strange
creature
,
Mr
Jones
,
to
be
*NL*
thus
giving
advice
to
a
man
with
whom
I
am
so
little
acquainted
,
and
*NL*
one
with
whose
behaviour
to
me
I
have
so
little
reason
to
be
pleased
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Jones
began
to
apologize
,
and
to
hope
he
had
not
offended
in
*NL*
anything
he
had
said
of
her
cousin
.
--
To
which
the
mask
answered
,
``
And
*NL*
are
you
so
little
versed
in
the
sex
,
to
imagine
you
can
well
affront
a
*NL*
lady
more
than
by
entertaining
her
with
your
passion
for
another
*NL*
woman
?
If
the
fairy
queen
had
conceived
no
better
opinion
of
your
*NL*
gallantry
,
she
would
scarce
have
appointed
you
to
meet
her
at
the
*NL*
masquerade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
never
less
inclination
to
an
amour
than
at
present
;
but
*NL*
gallantry
to
the
ladies
was
among
his
principles
of
honour
;
and
he
*NL*
held
it
as
much
incumbent
on
him
to
accept
a
challenge
to
love
,
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
a
challenge
to
fight
.
Nay
,
his
very
love
to
Sophia
made
it
*NL*
necessary
for
him
to
keep
well
with
the
lady
,
as
he
made
no
doubt
but
*NL*
she
was
capable
of
bringing
him
into
the
presence
of
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
therefore
to
make
a
very
warm
answer
to
her
last
speech
,
when
*NL*
a
mask
,
in
the
character
of
an
old
woman
,
joined
them
.
This
mask
was
*NL*
one
of
those
ladies
who
go
to
a
masquerade
only
to
vent
ill-nature
,
by
*NL*
telling
people
rude
truths
,
and
by
endeavouring
,
as
the
phrase
is
,
to
*NL*
spoil
as
much
sport
as
they
are
able
.
This
good
lady
,
therefore
,
*NL*
having
observed
Jones
,
and
his
friend
,
whom
she
well
knew
,
in
close
*NL*
consultation
together
in
a
corner
of
the
room
,
concluded
she
could
*NL*
nowhere
satisfy
her
spleen
better
than
by
interrupting
them
.
She
*NL*
attacked
them
,
therefore
,
and
soon
drove
them
from
their
retirement
;
*NL*
nor
was
she
contented
with
this
,
but
pursued
them
to
every
place
which
*NL*
they
shifted
to
avoid
her
;
till
Mr
Nightingale
,
seeing
the
distress
of
*NL*
his
friend
,
at
last
relieved
him
,
and
engaged
the
old
woman
in
another
*NL*
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Jones
and
his
mask
were
walking
together
about
the
room
,
to
rid
*NL*
themselves
of
the
teazer
,
he
observed
his
lady
speak
to
several
masks
,
*NL*
with
the
same
freedom
of
acquaintance
as
if
they
had
been
barefaced
.
*NL*
He
could
not
help
expressing
his
surprize
at
this
;
saying
,
``
Sure
,
*NL*
madam
,
you
must
have
infinite
discernment
,
to
know
people
in
all
*NL*
disguises
.
''
To
which
the
lady
answered
,
``
You
can
not
conceive
anything
*NL*
more
insipid
and
childish
than
a
masquerade
to
the
people
of
fashion
,
*NL*
who
in
general
know
one
another
as
well
here
as
when
they
meet
in
an
*NL*
assembly
or
a
drawing-room
;
nor
will
any
woman
of
condition
converse
*NL*
with
a
person
with
whom
she
is
not
acquainted
.
In
short
,
the
*NL*
generality
of
persons
whom
you
see
here
may
more
properly
be
said
to
*NL*
kill
time
in
this
place
than
in
any
other
;
and
generally
retire
from
*NL*
hence
more
tired
than
from
the
longest
sermon
.
To
say
the
truth
,
I
*NL*
begin
to
be
in
that
situation
myself
;
and
if
I
have
any
faculty
at
*NL*
guessing
,
you
are
not
much
better
pleased
.
I
protest
it
would
be
*NL*
almost
charity
in
me
to
go
home
for
your
sake
.
''
``
I
know
but
one
*NL*
charity
equal
to
it
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
and
that
is
to
suffer
me
to
wait
*NL*
on
you
home
.
''
``
Sure
,
''
answered
the
lady
,
``
you
have
a
strange
opinion
*NL*
of
me
,
to
imagine
,
that
upon
such
an
acquaintance
,
I
would
let
you
*NL*
into
my
doors
at
this
time
of
night
.
I
fancy
you
impute
the
friendship
*NL*
I
have
shown
my
cousin
to
some
other
motive
.
Confess
honestly
;
do
n't
*NL*
you
consider
this
contrived
interview
as
little
better
than
a
*NL*
downright
assignation
?
Are
you
used
,
Mr
Jones
,
to
make
these
sudden
*NL*
conquests
?
''
``
I
am
not
used
,
madam
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
to
submit
to
such
*NL*
sudden
conquests
;
but
as
you
have
taken
my
heart
by
surprize
,
the
rest
*NL*
of
my
body
hath
a
right
to
follow
;
so
you
must
pardon
me
if
I
resolve
*NL*
to
attend
you
wherever
you
go
.
''
He
accompanied
these
words
with
some
*NL*
proper
actions
;
upon
which
the
lady
,
after
a
gentle
rebuke
,
and
saying
*NL*
their
familiarity
would
be
observed
,
told
him
,
``
She
was
going
to
sup
*NL*
with
an
acquaintance
,
whither
she
hoped
he
would
not
follow
her
;
for
*NL*
if
you
should
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
shall
be
thought
an
unaccountable
*NL*
creature
,
though
my
friend
indeed
is
not
censorious
:
yet
I
hope
you
*NL*
wo
n't
follow
me
;
I
protest
I
shall
not
know
what
to
say
if
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
presently
after
quitted
the
masquerade
,
and
Jones
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
severe
prohibition
he
had
received
,
presumed
to
*NL*
attend
her
.
He
was
now
reduced
to
the
same
dilemma
we
have
mentioned
*NL*
before
,
namely
,
the
want
of
a
shilling
,
and
could
not
relieve
it
by
*NL*
borrowing
as
before
.
He
therefore
walked
boldly
on
after
the
chair
in
*NL*
which
his
lady
rode
,
pursued
by
a
grand
huzza
,
from
all
the
chairmen
*NL*
present
,
who
wisely
take
the
best
care
they
can
to
discountenance
all
*NL*
walking
afoot
by
their
betters
.
Luckily
,
however
,
the
gentry
who
*NL*
attend
at
the
Opera-house
were
too
busy
to
quit
their
stations
,
and
as
*NL*
the
lateness
of
the
hour
prevented
him
from
meeting
many
of
their
*NL*
brethren
in
the
street
,
he
proceeded
without
molestation
,
in
a
dress
,
*NL*
which
,
at
another
season
,
would
have
certainly
raised
a
mob
at
his
*NL*
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
was
set
down
in
a
street
not
far
from
Hanover-square
,
where
*NL*
the
door
being
presently
opened
,
she
was
carried
in
,
and
the
*NL*
gentleman
,
without
any
ceremony
,
walked
in
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
and
his
companion
were
now
together
in
a
very
well-furnished
and
*NL*
well-warmed
room
;
when
the
female
,
still
speaking
in
her
masquerade
*NL*
voice
,
said
she
was
surprized
at
her
friend
,
who
must
absolutely
have
*NL*
forgot
her
appointment
;
at
which
,
after
venting
much
resentment
,
she
*NL*
suddenly
exprest
some
apprehension
from
Jones
,
and
asked
him
what
the
*NL*
world
would
think
of
their
having
been
alone
together
in
a
house
at
*NL*
that
time
of
night
?
But
instead
of
a
direct
answer
to
so
important
a
*NL*
question
,
Jones
began
to
be
very
importunate
with
the
lady
to
unmask
;
*NL*
and
at
length
having
prevailed
,
there
appeared
not
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
*NL*
but
the
Lady
Bellaston
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
tedious
to
give
the
particular
conversation
,
which
*NL*
consisted
of
very
common
and
ordinary
occurrences
,
and
which
lasted
*NL*
from
two
till
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
It
is
sufficient
to
mention
*NL*
all
of
it
that
is
anywise
material
to
this
history
.
And
this
was
a
*NL*
promise
that
the
lady
would
endeavour
to
find
out
Sophia
,
and
in
a
few
*NL*
days
bring
him
to
an
interview
with
her
,
on
condition
that
he
would
*NL*
then
take
his
leave
of
her
.
When
this
was
thoroughly
settled
,
and
a
*NL*
second
meeting
in
the
evening
appointed
at
the
same
place
,
they
*NL*
separated
;
the
lady
returned
to
her
house
,
and
Jones
to
his
lodgings
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
viii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
a
scene
of
distress
,
which
will
appear
very
extraordinary
*NL*
to
most
of
our
readers
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
having
refreshed
himself
with
a
few
hours
'
sleep
,
summoned
*NL*
Partridge
to
his
presence
;
and
delivering
him
a
bank-note
of
fifty
*NL*
pounds
,
ordered
him
to
go
and
change
it
.
Partridge
received
this
with
*NL*
sparkling
eyes
,
though
,
when
he
came
to
reflect
farther
,
it
raised
in
*NL*
him
some
suspicions
not
very
advantageous
to
the
honour
of
his
master
:
*NL*
to
these
the
dreadful
idea
he
had
of
the
masquerade
,
the
disguise
in
*NL*
which
his
master
had
gone
out
and
returned
,
and
his
having
been
abroad
*NL*
all
night
,
contributed
.
In
plain
language
,
the
only
way
he
could
*NL*
possibly
find
to
account
for
the
possession
of
this
note
,
was
by
*NL*
robbery
:
and
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
the
reader
,
unless
he
should
*NL*
suspect
it
was
owing
to
the
generosity
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
can
hardly
*NL*
imagine
any
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
clear
,
therefore
,
the
honour
of
Mr
Jones
,
and
to
do
justice
to
the
*NL*
liberality
of
the
lady
,
he
had
really
received
this
present
from
her
,
*NL*
who
,
though
she
did
not
give
much
into
the
hackney
charities
of
the
*NL*
age
,
such
as
building
hospitals
,
&
c.
,
was
not
,
however
,
entirely
void
*NL*
of
that
Christian
virtue
;
and
conceived
-LRB-
very
rightly
I
think
-RRB-
that
a
*NL*
young
fellow
of
merit
,
without
a
shilling
in
the
world
,
was
no
*NL*
improper
object
of
this
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
and
Mr
Nightingale
had
been
invited
to
dine
this
day
with
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
.
At
the
appointed
hour
,
therefore
,
the
two
young
gentlemen
,
*NL*
with
the
two
girls
,
attended
in
the
parlour
,
where
they
waited
from
*NL*
three
till
almost
five
before
the
good
woman
appeared
.
She
had
been
*NL*
out
of
town
to
visit
a
relation
,
of
whom
,
at
her
return
,
she
gave
the
*NL*
following
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
gentlemen
,
you
will
pardon
my
making
you
wait
;
I
am
sure
if
*NL*
you
knew
the
occasion
--
I
have
been
to
see
a
cousin
of
mine
,
about
six
*NL*
miles
off
,
who
now
lies
in
.
--
It
should
be
a
warning
to
all
persons
*NL*
-LRB-
says
she
,
looking
at
her
daughters
-RRB-
how
they
marry
indiscreetly
.
*NL*
There
is
no
happiness
in
this
world
without
a
competency
.
O
Nancy
!
how
*NL*
shall
I
describe
the
wretched
condition
in
which
I
found
your
poor
*NL*
cousin
?
she
hath
scarce
lain
in
a
week
,
and
there
was
she
,
this
*NL*
dreadful
weather
,
in
a
cold
room
,
without
any
curtains
to
her
bed
,
and
*NL*
not
a
bushel
of
coals
in
her
house
to
supply
her
with
fire
;
her
second
*NL*
son
,
that
sweet
little
fellow
,
lies
ill
of
a
quinzy
in
the
same
bed
*NL*
with
his
mother
;
for
there
is
no
other
bed
in
the
house
.
Poor
little
*NL*
Tommy
!
I
believe
,
Nancy
,
you
will
never
see
your
favourite
any
more
;
*NL*
for
he
is
really
very
ill
.
The
rest
of
the
children
are
in
pretty
good
*NL*
health
:
but
Molly
,
I
am
afraid
,
will
do
herself
an
injury
:
she
is
but
*NL*
thirteen
years
old
,
Mr
Nightingale
,
and
yet
,
in
my
life
,
I
never
saw
a
*NL*
better
nurse
:
she
tends
both
her
mother
and
her
brother
;
and
,
what
is
*NL*
wonderful
in
a
creature
so
young
,
she
shows
all
the
chearfulness
in
*NL*
the
world
to
her
mother
;
and
yet
I
saw
her
--
I
saw
the
poor
child
,
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
,
turn
about
,
and
privately
wipe
the
tears
from
her
eyes
.
''
*NL*
Here
Mrs
Miller
was
prevented
,
by
her
own
tears
,
from
going
on
,
and
*NL*
there
was
not
,
I
believe
,
a
person
present
who
did
not
accompany
her
*NL*
in
them
;
at
length
she
a
little
recovered
herself
,
and
proceeded
thus
:
*NL*
``
In
all
this
distress
the
mother
supports
her
spirits
in
a
surprizing
*NL*
manner
.
The
danger
of
her
son
sits
heaviest
upon
her
,
and
yet
she
*NL*
endeavours
as
much
as
possible
to
conceal
even
this
concern
,
on
her
*NL*
husband
's
account
.
Her
grief
,
however
,
sometimes
gets
the
better
of
*NL*
all
her
endeavours
;
for
she
was
always
extravagantly
fond
of
this
boy
,
*NL*
and
a
most
sensible
,
sweet-tempered
creature
it
is
.
I
protest
I
was
*NL*
never
more
affected
in
my
life
than
when
I
heard
the
little
wretch
,
*NL*
who
is
hardly
yet
seven
years
old
,
while
his
mother
was
wetting
him
*NL*
with
her
tears
,
beg
her
to
be
comforted
.
`
Indeed
,
mamma
,
'
cried
the
*NL*
child
,
`
I
sha
n't
die
;
God
Almighty
,
I
'm
sure
,
wo
n't
take
Tommy
away
;
*NL*
let
heaven
be
ever
so
fine
a
place
,
I
had
rather
stay
here
and
starve
*NL*
with
you
and
my
papa
than
go
to
it
.
'
Pardon
me
,
gentlemen
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
it
''
-LRB-
says
she
,
wiping
her
eyes
-RRB-
,
``
such
sensibility
and
affection
*NL*
in
a
child
.
--
And
yet
,
perhaps
,
he
is
least
the
object
of
pity
;
for
a
*NL*
day
or
two
will
,
most
probably
,
place
him
beyond
the
reach
of
all
*NL*
human
evils
.
The
father
is
,
indeed
,
most
worthy
of
compassion
.
Poor
*NL*
man
,
his
countenance
is
the
very
picture
of
horror
,
and
he
looks
like
*NL*
one
rather
dead
than
alive
.
Oh
heavens
!
what
a
scene
did
I
behold
at
*NL*
my
first
coming
into
the
room
!
The
good
creature
was
lying
behind
the
*NL*
bolster
,
supporting
at
once
both
his
child
and
his
wife
.
He
had
*NL*
nothing
on
but
a
thin
waistcoat
;
for
his
coat
was
spread
over
the
bed
,
*NL*
to
supply
the
want
of
blankets
.
--
When
he
rose
up
at
my
entrance
,
I
*NL*
scarce
knew
him
.
As
comely
a
man
,
Mr
Jones
,
within
this
fortnight
,
as
*NL*
you
ever
beheld
;
Mr
Nightingale
hath
seen
him
.
His
eyes
sunk
,
his
face
*NL*
pale
,
with
a
long
beard
.
His
body
shivering
with
cold
,
and
worn
with
*NL*
hunger
too
;
for
my
cousin
says
she
can
hardly
prevail
upon
him
to
*NL*
eat
.
--
He
told
me
himself
in
a
whisper
--
he
told
me
--
I
ca
n't
repeat
*NL*
it
--
he
said
he
could
not
bear
to
eat
the
bread
his
children
wanted
.
*NL*
And
yet
,
can
you
believe
it
,
gentlemen
?
in
all
this
misery
his
wife
*NL*
has
as
good
caudle
as
if
she
lay
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
*NL*
affluence
;
I
tasted
it
,
and
I
scarce
ever
tasted
better
.
--
The
means
of
*NL*
procuring
her
this
,
he
said
,
he
believed
was
sent
him
by
an
angel
from
*NL*
heaven
.
I
know
not
what
he
meant
;
for
I
had
not
spirits
enough
to
ask
*NL*
a
single
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
a
love-match
,
as
they
call
it
,
on
both
sides
;
that
is
,
a
*NL*
match
between
two
beggars
.
I
must
,
indeed
,
say
,
I
never
saw
a
fonder
*NL*
couple
;
but
what
is
their
fondness
good
for
,
but
to
torment
each
*NL*
other
?
''
``
Indeed
,
mamma
,
''
cries
Nancy
,
``
I
have
always
looked
on
my
*NL*
cousin
Anderson
''
-LRB-
for
that
was
her
name
-RRB-
``
as
one
of
the
happiest
of
*NL*
women
.
''
``
I
am
sure
,
''
says
Mrs
Miller
,
``
the
case
at
present
is
much
*NL*
otherwise
;
for
any
one
might
have
discerned
that
the
tender
*NL*
consideration
of
each
other
's
sufferings
makes
the
most
intolerable
*NL*
part
of
their
calamity
,
both
to
the
husband
and
wife
.
Compared
to
*NL*
which
,
hunger
and
cold
,
as
they
affect
their
own
persons
only
,
are
*NL*
scarce
evils
.
Nay
,
the
very
children
,
the
youngest
,
which
is
not
two
*NL*
years
old
,
excepted
,
feel
in
the
same
manner
;
for
they
are
a
most
*NL*
loving
family
,
and
,
if
they
had
but
a
bare
competency
,
would
be
the
*NL*
happiest
people
in
the
world
.
''
``
I
never
saw
the
least
sign
of
misery
*NL*
at
her
house
,
''
replied
Nancy
;
``
I
am
sure
my
heart
bleeds
for
what
you
*NL*
now
tell
me
.
''
--
``
O
child
,
''
answered
the
mother
,
``
she
hath
always
*NL*
endeavoured
to
make
the
best
of
everything
.
They
have
always
been
in
*NL*
great
distress
;
but
,
indeed
,
this
absolute
ruin
hath
been
brought
upon
*NL*
them
by
others
.
The
poor
man
was
bail
for
the
villain
his
brother
;
and
*NL*
about
a
week
ago
,
the
very
day
before
her
lying-in
,
their
goods
were
*NL*
all
carried
away
,
and
sold
by
an
execution
.
He
sent
a
letter
to
me
of
*NL*
it
by
one
of
the
bailiffs
,
which
the
villain
never
delivered
.
--
What
*NL*
must
he
think
of
my
suffering
a
week
to
pass
before
he
heard
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
with
dry
eyes
that
Jones
heard
this
narrative
;
when
it
was
*NL*
ended
he
took
Mrs
Miller
apart
with
him
into
another
room
,
and
,
*NL*
delivering
her
his
purse
,
in
which
was
the
sum
of
L50
,
desired
her
to
*NL*
send
as
much
of
it
as
she
thought
proper
to
these
poor
people
.
The
*NL*
look
which
Mrs
Miller
gave
Jones
,
on
this
occasion
,
is
not
easy
to
be
*NL*
described
.
She
burst
into
a
kind
of
agony
of
transport
,
and
cryed
*NL*
out
--
``
Good
heavens
!
is
there
such
a
man
in
the
world
?
''
--
But
*NL*
recollecting
herself
,
she
said
,
``
Indeed
I
know
one
such
;
but
can
there
*NL*
be
another
?
''
``
I
hope
,
madam
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
there
are
many
who
have
*NL*
common
humanity
;
for
to
relieve
such
distresses
in
our
fellow-creatures
,
*NL*
can
hardly
be
called
more
.
''
Mrs
Miller
then
took
ten
guineas
,
which
*NL*
were
the
utmost
he
could
prevail
with
her
to
accept
,
and
said
,
``
She
*NL*
would
find
some
means
of
conveying
them
early
the
next
morning
;
''
*NL*
adding
,
``
that
she
had
herself
done
some
little
matter
for
the
poor
*NL*
people
,
and
had
not
left
them
in
quite
so
much
misery
as
she
found
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
then
returned
to
the
parlour
,
where
Nightingale
expressed
much
*NL*
concern
at
the
dreadful
situation
of
these
wretches
,
whom
indeed
he
*NL*
knew
;
for
he
had
seen
them
more
than
once
at
Mrs
Miller
's
.
He
*NL*
inveighed
against
the
folly
of
making
oneself
liable
for
the
debts
of
*NL*
others
;
vented
many
bitter
execrations
against
the
brother
;
and
*NL*
concluded
with
wishing
something
could
be
done
for
the
unfortunate
*NL*
family
.
``
Suppose
,
madam
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
should
recommend
them
to
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
?
Or
what
think
you
of
a
collection
?
I
will
give
them
a
*NL*
guinea
with
all
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
made
no
answer
;
and
Nancy
,
to
whom
her
mother
had
whispered
*NL*
the
generosity
of
Jones
,
turned
pale
upon
the
occasion
;
though
,
if
*NL*
either
of
them
was
angry
with
Nightingale
,
it
was
surely
without
*NL*
reason
.
For
the
liberality
of
Jones
,
if
he
had
known
it
,
was
not
an
*NL*
example
which
he
had
any
obligation
to
follow
;
and
there
are
thousands
*NL*
who
would
not
have
contributed
a
single
halfpenny
,
as
indeed
he
did
*NL*
not
in
effect
,
for
he
made
no
tender
of
anything
;
and
therefore
,
as
*NL*
the
others
thought
proper
to
make
no
demand
,
he
kept
his
money
in
his
*NL*
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
,
in
truth
,
observed
,
and
shall
never
have
a
better
opportunity
*NL*
than
at
present
to
communicate
my
observation
,
that
the
world
are
in
*NL*
general
divided
into
two
opinions
concerning
charity
,
which
are
the
*NL*
very
reverse
of
each
other
.
One
party
seems
to
hold
,
that
all
acts
of
*NL*
this
kind
are
to
be
esteemed
as
voluntary
gifts
,
and
,
however
little
*NL*
you
give
-LRB-
if
indeed
no
more
than
your
good
wishes
-RRB-
,
you
acquire
a
*NL*
great
degree
of
merit
in
so
doing
.
Others
,
on
the
contrary
,
appear
to
*NL*
be
as
firmly
persuaded
,
that
beneficence
is
a
positive
duty
,
and
that
*NL*
whenever
the
rich
fall
greatly
short
of
their
ability
in
relieving
the
*NL*
distresses
of
the
poor
,
their
pitiful
largesses
are
so
far
from
being
*NL*
meritorious
,
that
they
have
only
performed
their
duty
by
halves
,
and
*NL*
are
in
some
sense
more
contemptible
than
those
who
have
entirely
*NL*
neglected
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
reconcile
these
different
opinions
is
not
in
my
power
.
I
shall
only
*NL*
add
,
that
the
givers
are
generally
of
the
former
sentiment
,
and
the
*NL*
receivers
are
almost
universally
inclined
to
the
latter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
ix
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
treats
of
matters
of
a
very
different
kind
from
those
in
the
*NL*
preceding
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Jones
met
his
lady
again
,
and
a
long
conversation
again
*NL*
ensued
between
them
:
but
as
it
consisted
only
of
the
same
ordinary
*NL*
occurrences
as
before
,
we
shall
avoid
mentioning
particulars
,
which
we
*NL*
despair
of
rendering
agreeable
to
the
reader
;
unless
he
is
one
whose
*NL*
devotion
to
the
fair
sex
,
like
that
of
the
papists
to
their
saints
,
*NL*
wants
to
be
raised
by
the
help
of
pictures
.
But
I
am
so
far
from
*NL*
desiring
to
exhibit
such
pictures
to
the
public
,
that
I
would
wish
to
*NL*
draw
a
curtain
over
those
that
have
been
lately
set
forth
in
certain
*NL*
French
novels
;
very
bungling
copies
of
which
have
been
presented
us
*NL*
here
under
the
name
of
translations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
grew
still
more
and
more
impatient
to
see
Sophia
;
and
finding
,
*NL*
after
repeated
interviews
with
Lady
Bellaston
,
no
likelihood
of
*NL*
obtaining
this
by
her
means
-LRB-
for
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
lady
began
to
*NL*
treat
even
the
mention
of
the
name
of
Sophia
with
resentment
-RRB-
,
he
*NL*
resolved
to
try
some
other
method
.
He
made
no
doubt
but
that
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
knew
where
his
angel
was
,
so
he
thought
it
most
likely
that
*NL*
some
of
her
servants
should
be
acquainted
with
the
same
secret
.
*NL*
Partridge
therefore
was
employed
to
get
acquainted
with
those
*NL*
servants
,
in
order
to
fish
this
secret
out
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Few
situations
can
be
imagined
more
uneasy
than
that
to
which
his
poor
*NL*
master
was
at
present
reduced
;
for
besides
the
difficulties
he
met
*NL*
with
in
discovering
Sophia
,
besides
the
fears
he
had
of
having
*NL*
disobliged
her
,
and
the
assurances
he
had
received
from
Lady
Bellaston
*NL*
of
the
resolution
which
Sophia
had
taken
against
him
,
and
of
her
*NL*
having
purposely
concealed
herself
from
him
,
which
he
had
sufficient
*NL*
reason
to
believe
might
be
true
;
he
had
still
a
difficulty
to
combat
*NL*
which
it
was
not
in
the
power
of
his
mistress
to
remove
,
however
kind
*NL*
her
inclination
might
have
been
.
This
was
the
exposing
of
her
to
be
*NL*
disinherited
of
all
her
father
's
estate
,
the
almost
inevitable
*NL*
consequence
of
their
coming
together
without
a
consent
,
which
he
had
*NL*
no
hopes
of
ever
obtaining
.
*NL*
*NL*
Add
to
all
these
the
many
obligations
which
Lady
Bellaston
,
whose
*NL*
violent
fondness
we
can
no
longer
conceal
,
had
heaped
upon
him
;
so
*NL*
that
by
her
means
he
was
now
become
one
of
the
best-dressed
men
about
*NL*
town
;
and
was
not
only
relieved
from
those
ridiculous
distresses
we
*NL*
have
before
mentioned
,
but
was
actually
raised
to
a
state
of
affluence
*NL*
beyond
what
he
had
ever
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
though
there
are
many
gentlemen
who
very
well
reconcile
it
to
*NL*
their
consciences
to
possess
themselves
of
the
whole
fortune
of
a
*NL*
woman
,
without
making
her
any
kind
of
return
;
yet
to
a
mind
,
the
*NL*
proprietor
of
which
doth
not
deserved
to
be
hanged
,
nothing
is
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
more
irksome
than
to
support
love
with
gratitude
only
;
*NL*
especially
where
inclination
pulls
the
heart
a
contrary
way
.
Such
was
*NL*
the
unhappy
case
of
Jones
;
for
though
the
virtuous
love
he
bore
to
*NL*
Sophia
,
and
which
left
very
little
affection
for
any
other
woman
,
had
*NL*
been
entirely
out
of
the
question
,
he
could
never
have
been
able
to
*NL*
have
made
any
adequate
return
to
the
generous
passion
of
this
lady
,
*NL*
who
had
indeed
been
once
an
object
of
desire
,
but
was
now
entered
at
*NL*
least
into
the
autumn
of
life
,
though
she
wore
all
the
gaiety
of
*NL*
youth
,
both
in
her
dress
and
manner
;
nay
,
she
contrived
still
to
*NL*
maintain
the
roses
in
her
cheeks
;
but
these
,
like
flowers
forced
out
*NL*
of
season
by
art
,
had
none
of
that
lively
blooming
freshness
with
*NL*
which
Nature
,
at
the
proper
time
,
bedecks
her
own
productions
.
She
*NL*
had
,
besides
,
a
certain
imperfection
,
which
renders
some
flowers
,
*NL*
though
very
beautiful
to
the
eye
,
very
improper
to
be
placed
in
a
*NL*
wilderness
of
sweets
,
and
what
above
all
others
is
most
disagreeable
*NL*
to
the
breath
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Jones
saw
all
these
discouragements
on
the
one
side
,
he
felt
*NL*
his
obligations
full
as
strongly
on
the
other
;
nor
did
he
less
plainly
*NL*
discern
the
ardent
passion
whence
those
obligations
proceeded
,
the
*NL*
extreme
violence
of
which
if
he
failed
to
equal
,
he
well
knew
the
lady
*NL*
would
think
him
ungrateful
;
and
,
what
is
worse
,
he
would
have
thought
*NL*
himself
so
.
He
knew
the
tacit
consideration
upon
which
all
her
favours
*NL*
were
conferred
;
and
as
his
necessity
obliged
him
to
accept
them
,
so
*NL*
his
honour
,
he
concluded
,
forced
him
to
pay
the
price
.
This
therefore
*NL*
he
resolved
to
do
,
whatever
misery
it
cost
him
,
and
to
devote
himself
*NL*
to
her
,
from
that
great
principle
of
justice
,
by
which
the
laws
of
*NL*
some
countries
oblige
a
debtor
,
who
is
no
otherwise
capable
of
*NL*
discharging
his
debt
,
to
become
the
slave
of
his
creditor
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
meditating
on
these
matters
,
he
received
the
following
*NL*
note
from
the
lady
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
foolish
,
but
a
very
perverse
accident
hath
happened
since
*NL*
our
last
meeting
,
which
makes
it
improper
I
should
see
you
any
more
*NL*
at
the
usual
place
.
I
will
,
if
possible
,
contrive
some
other
place

In
the

adieu

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
disappointment
,
perhaps
,
the
reader
may
conclude
was
not
very
*NL*
great
;
but
if
it
was
,
he
was
quickly
relieved
;
for
in
less
than
an
*NL*
hour
afterwards
another
note
was
brought
him
from
the
same
hand
,
which
*NL*
contained
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
altered
my
mind
since
I
wrote
;
a
change
which
,
if
you
are
no
*NL*
stranger
to
the
tenderest
of
all
passions
,
you
will
not
wonder
at
.
I
*NL*
am
now
resolved
to
see
you
this
evening
at
my
own
house
,
whatever
*NL*
may
be
the
consequence
.
Come
to
me
exactly
at
seven
;
I
dine
abroad
,
*NL*
but
will
be
at
home
by
that
time
.
A
day
,
I
find
,
to
those
that
*NL*
sincerely
love
,
seems
longer
than
I
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
should
accidentally
be
a
few
moments
before
me
,
bid
them
*NL*
show
you
into
the
drawing-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
confess
the
truth
,
Jones
was
less
pleased
with
this
last
epistle
*NL*
than
he
had
been
with
the
former
,
as
he
was
prevented
by
it
from
*NL*
complying
with
the
earnest
entreaties
of
Mr
Nightingale
,
with
whom
he
*NL*
had
now
contracted
much
intimacy
and
friendship
.
These
entreaties
were
*NL*
to
go
with
that
young
gentleman
and
his
company
to
a
new
play
,
which
*NL*
was
to
be
acted
that
evening
,
and
which
a
very
large
party
had
agreed
*NL*
to
damn
,
from
some
dislike
they
had
taken
to
the
author
,
who
was
a
*NL*
friend
to
one
of
Mr
Nightingale
's
acquaintance
.
And
this
sort
of
fun
,
*NL*
our
heroe
,
we
are
ashamed
to
confess
,
would
willingly
have
preferred
*NL*
to
the
above
kind
appointment
;
but
his
honour
got
the
better
of
his
*NL*
inclination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
attend
him
to
this
intended
interview
with
the
lady
,
we
*NL*
think
proper
to
account
for
both
the
preceding
notes
,
as
the
reader
*NL*
may
possibly
be
not
a
little
surprized
at
the
imprudence
of
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
,
in
bringing
her
lover
to
the
very
house
where
her
rival
was
*NL*
lodged
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
then
,
the
mistress
of
the
house
where
these
lovers
had
hitherto
*NL*
met
,
and
who
had
been
for
some
years
a
pensioner
to
that
lady
,
was
now
*NL*
become
a
methodist
,
and
had
that
very
morning
waited
upon
her
*NL*
ladyship
,
and
after
rebuking
her
very
severely
for
her
past
life
,
had
*NL*
positively
declared
that
she
would
,
on
no
account
,
be
instrumental
in
*NL*
carrying
on
any
of
her
affairs
for
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hurry
of
spirits
into
which
this
accident
threw
the
lady
made
her
*NL*
despair
of
possibly
finding
any
other
convenience
to
meet
Jones
that
*NL*
evening
;
but
as
she
began
a
little
to
recover
from
her
uneasiness
at
*NL*
the
disappointment
,
she
set
her
thoughts
to
work
,
when
luckily
it
came
*NL*
into
her
head
to
propose
to
Sophia
to
go
to
the
play
,
which
was
*NL*
immediately
consented
to
,
and
a
proper
lady
provided
for
her
*NL*
companion
.
Mrs
Honour
was
likewise
despatched
with
Mrs
Etoff
on
the
*NL*
same
errand
of
pleasure
;
and
thus
her
own
house
was
left
free
for
the
*NL*
safe
reception
of
Mr
Jones
,
with
whom
she
promised
herself
two
or
*NL*
three
hours
of
uninterrupted
conversation
after
her
return
from
the
*NL*
place
where
she
dined
,
which
was
at
a
friend
's
house
in
a
pretty
*NL*
distant
part
of
the
town
,
near
her
old
place
of
assignation
,
where
she
*NL*
had
engaged
herself
before
she
was
well
apprized
of
the
revolution
*NL*
that
had
happened
in
the
mind
and
morals
of
her
late
confidante
.

A
chapter
which
,
though
short
,
may
draw
tears
from
some
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
was
just
dressed
to
wait
on
Lady
Bellaston
,
when
Mrs
Miller
*NL*
rapped
at
his
door
;
and
,
being
admitted
,
very
earnestly
desired
his
*NL*
company
below-stairs
,
to
drink
tea
in
the
parlour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
his
entrance
into
the
room
,
she
presently
introduced
a
person
to
*NL*
him
,
saying
,
``
This
,
sir
,
is
my
cousin
,
who
hath
been
so
greatly
*NL*
beholden
to
your
goodness
,
for
which
he
begs
to
return
you
his
*NL*
sincerest
thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
had
scarce
entered
upon
that
speech
which
Mrs
Miller
had
so
*NL*
kindly
prefaced
,
when
both
Jones
and
he
,
looking
stedfastly
at
each
*NL*
other
,
showed
at
once
the
utmost
tokens
of
surprize
.
The
voice
of
the
*NL*
latter
began
instantly
to
faulter
;
and
,
instead
of
finishing
his
*NL*
speech
,
he
sunk
down
into
a
chair
,
crying
,
``
It
is
so
,
I
am
convinced
*NL*
it
is
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
!
what
's
the
meaning
of
this
?
''
cries
Mrs
Miller
;
``
you
are
not
*NL*
ill
,
I
hope
,
cousin
?
Some
water
,
a
dram
this
instant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
not
frighted
,
madam
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
I
have
almost
as
much
need
of
*NL*
a
dram
as
your
cousin
.
We
are
equally
surprized
at
this
unexpected
*NL*
meeting
.
Your
cousin
is
an
acquaintance
of
mine
,
Mrs
Miller
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
acquaintance
!
''
cries
the
man
.
--
``
Oh
,
heaven
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
an
acquaintance
,
''
repeated
Jones
,
``
and
an
honoured
acquaintance
*NL*
too
.
When
I
do
not
love
and
honour
the
man
who
dares
venture
*NL*
everything
to
preserve
his
wife
and
children
from
instant
destruction
,
*NL*
may
I
have
a
friend
capable
of
disowning
me
in
adversity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
are
an
excellent
young
man
,
''
cries
Mrs
Miller
:
--
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
*NL*
poor
creature
!
he
hath
ventured
everything
.
--
If
he
had
not
had
one
of
*NL*
the
best
of
constitutions
,
it
must
have
killed
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousin
,
''
cries
the
man
,
who
had
now
pretty
well
recovered
himself
,
*NL*
``
this
is
the
angel
from
heaven
whom
I
meant
.
This
is
he
to
whom
,
*NL*
before
I
saw
you
,
I
owed
the
preservation
of
my
Peggy
.
He
it
was
to
*NL*
whose
generosity
every
comfort
,
every
support
which
I
have
procured
*NL*
for
her
,
was
owing
.
He
is
,
indeed
,
the
worthiest
,
bravest
,
noblest
;
of
*NL*
all
human
beings

O
cousin
,
I
have
obligations
to
this
gentleman
of
*NL*
such
a
nature
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mention
nothing
of
obligations
,
''
cries
Jones
eagerly
;
``
not
a
word
,
I
*NL*
insist
upon
it
,
not
a
word
''
-LRB-
meaning
,
I
suppose
,
that
he
would
not
*NL*
have
him
betray
the
affair
of
the
robbery
to
any
person
-RRB-
.
``
If
,
by
the
*NL*
trifle
you
have
received
from
me
,
I
have
preserved
a
whole
family
,
*NL*
sure
pleasure
was
never
bought
so
cheap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
!
''
cries
the
man
,
``
I
wish
you
could
this
instant
see
my
house

*NL*
If
any
person
had
ever
a
right
to
the
pleasure
you
mention
,
I
am
*NL*
convinced
it
is
yourself
.
My
cousin
tells
me
she
acquainted
you
with
*NL*
the
distress
in
which
she
found
us
.
That
,
sir
,
is
all
greatly
removed
,
*NL*
and
chiefly
by
your
goodness
.
--
My
children
have
now
a
bed
to
lie
*NL*
on
--
and
they
have
--
they
have

eternal
blessings
reward
you
for
*NL*
it

they
have
bread
to
eat

My
little
boy
is
recovered
;
my
wife
is
*NL*
out
of
danger
,
and
I
am
happy

All

all
owing
to
you

and
to
my
*NL*
cousin
here

one
of
the
best
of

Indeed

I
must
see
you
at
*NL*
my
house

Indeed
my
wife
must
see
you
,
and
thank
you
.

My
children
*NL*
too
must
express
their
gratitude
.
--
Indeed
,
sir
,
they
are
not
without
*NL*
a
sense
of
their
obligation
;
but
what
is
my
feeling
when
I
reflect
to
*NL*
whom
I
owe
that
they
are
now
capable
of
expressing
their
*NL*
gratitude
.
--
Oh
,
sir
,
the
little
hearts
which
you
have
warmed
had
now
*NL*
been
cold
as
ice
without
your
assistance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Jones
attempted
to
prevent
the
poor
man
from
proceeding
;
but
*NL*
indeed
the
overflowing
of
his
own
heart
would
of
itself
have
stopped
*NL*
his
words
.
And
now
Mrs
Miller
likewise
began
to
pour
forth
*NL*
thanksgivings
,
as
well
in
her
own
name
,
as
in
that
of
her
cousin
,
and
*NL*
concluded
with
saying
,
``
She
doubted
not
but
such
goodness
would
meet
a
*NL*
glorious
reward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
answered
,
``
He
had
been
sufficiently
rewarded
already
.
Your
*NL*
cousin
's
account
,
madam
,
''
said
he
,
``
hath
given
me
a
sensation
more
*NL*
pleasing
than
I
have
ever
known
.
He
must
be
a
wretch
who
is
unmoved
at
*NL*
hearing
such
a
story
;
how
transporting
then
must
be
the
thought
of
*NL*
having
happily
acted
a
part
in
this
scene
!
If
there
are
men
who
can
not
*NL*
feel
the
delight
of
giving
happiness
to
others
,
I
sincerely
pity
them
,
*NL*
as
they
are
incapable
of
tasting
what
is
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
greater
*NL*
honour
,
a
higher
interest
,
and
a
sweeter
pleasure
than
the
ambitious
,
*NL*
the
avaricious
,
or
the
voluptuous
man
can
ever
obtain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
of
appointment
being
now
come
,
Jones
was
forced
to
take
a
*NL*
hasty
leave
,
but
not
before
he
had
heartily
shaken
his
friend
by
the
*NL*
hand
,
and
desired
to
see
him
again
as
soon
as
possible
;
promising
that
*NL*
he
would
himself
take
the
first
opportunity
of
visiting
him
at
his
own
*NL*
house
.
He
then
stept
into
his
chair
,
and
proceeded
to
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
's
,
greatly
exulting
in
the
happiness
which
he
had
procured
*NL*
to
this
poor
family
;
nor
could
he
forbear
reflecting
,
without
horror
,
*NL*
on
the
dreadful
consequences
which
must
have
attended
them
,
had
he
*NL*
listened
rather
to
the
voice
of
strict
justice
than
to
that
of
mercy
,
*NL*
when
he
was
attacked
on
the
high
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
sung
forth
the
praises
of
Jones
during
the
whole
evening
,
*NL*
in
which
Mr
Anderson
,
while
he
stayed
,
so
passionately
accompanied
*NL*
her
,
that
he
was
often
on
the
very
point
of
mentioning
the
*NL*
circumstance
of
the
robbery
.
However
,
he
luckily
recollected
himself
,
*NL*
and
avoided
an
indiscretion
which
would
have
been
so
much
the
greater
,
*NL*
as
he
knew
Mrs
Miller
to
be
extremely
strict
and
nice
in
her
*NL*
principles
.
He
was
likewise
well
apprized
of
the
loquacity
of
this
*NL*
lady
;
and
yet
such
was
his
gratitude
,
that
it
had
almost
got
the
*NL*
better
both
of
discretion
and
shame
,
and
made
him
publish
that
which
*NL*
would
have
defamed
his
own
character
,
rather
than
omit
any
*NL*
circumstances
which
might
do
the
fullest
honour
to
his
benefactor
.

In

the

will
be
surprized

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
was
rather
earlier
than
the
time
appointed
,
and
earlier
than
*NL*
the
lady
;
whose
arrival
was
hindered
,
not
only
by
the
distance
of
the
*NL*
place
where
she
dined
,
but
by
some
other
cross
accidents
very
*NL*
vexatious
to
one
in
her
situation
of
mind
.
He
was
accordingly
shown
*NL*
into
the
drawing-room
,
where
he
had
not
been
many
minutes
before
the
*NL*
door
opened
,
and
in
came
--
no
other
than
Sophia
herself
,
who
had
left
*NL*
the
play
before
the
end
of
the
first
act
;
for
this
,
as
we
have
already
*NL*
said
,
being
,
a
new
play
,
at
which
two
large
parties
met
,
the
one
to
*NL*
damn
,
and
the
other
to
applaud
,
a
violent
uproar
,
and
an
engagement
*NL*
between
the
two
parties
,
had
so
terrified
our
heroine
,
that
she
was
*NL*
glad
to
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
a
young
gentleman
who
*NL*
safely
conveyed
her
to
her
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Lady
Bellaston
had
acquainted
her
that
she
should
not
be
at
home
*NL*
till
late
,
Sophia
,
expecting
to
find
no
one
in
the
room
,
came
hastily
*NL*
in
,
and
went
directly
to
a
glass
which
almost
fronted
her
,
without
*NL*
once
looking
towards
the
upper
end
of
the
room
,
where
the
statue
of
*NL*
Jones
now
stood
motionless
.
--
In
this
glass
it
was
,
after
*NL*
contemplating
her
own
lovely
face
,
that
she
first
discovered
the
said
*NL*
statue
;
when
,
instantly
turning
about
,
she
perceived
the
reality
of
*NL*
the
vision
:
upon
which
she
gave
a
violent
scream
,
and
scarce
preserved
*NL*
herself
from
fainting
,
till
Jones
was
able
to
move
to
her
,
and
support
*NL*
her
in
his
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
paint
the
looks
or
thoughts
of
either
of
these
lovers
,
is
beyond
my
*NL*
power
.
As
their
sensations
,
from
their
mutual
silence
,
may
be
judged
*NL*
to
have
been
too
big
for
their
own
utterance
,
it
can
not
be
supposed
*NL*
that
I
should
be
able
to
express
them
:
and
the
misfortune
is
,
that
few
*NL*
of
my
readers
have
been
enough
in
love
to
feel
by
their
own
hearts
*NL*
what
past
at
this
time
in
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
pause
,
Jones
,
with
faultering
accents
,
said
--
``
I
see
,
*NL*
madam
,
you
are
surprized
.
''
--
``
Surprized
!
''
answered
she
;
``
Oh
heavens
!
*NL*
Indeed
,
I
am
surprized
.
I
almost
doubt
whether
you
are
the
person
you
*NL*
seem
.
''
--
``
Indeed
,
''
cries
he
,
``
my
Sophia
,
pardon
me
,
madam
,
for
this
*NL*
once
calling
you
so
,
I
am
that
very
wretched
Jones
,
whom
fortune
,
*NL*
after
so
many
disappointments
,
hath
,
at
last
,
kindly
conducted
to
you
.
*NL*
Oh
!
my
Sophia
,
did
you
know
the
thousand
torments
I
have
suffered
in
*NL*
this
long
,
fruitless
pursuit
.
''
--
``
Pursuit
of
whom
?
''
said
Sophia
,
a
*NL*
little
recollecting
herself
,
and
assuming
a
reserved
air
.
--
``
Can
you
be
*NL*
so
cruel
to
ask
that
question
?
''
cries
Jones
;
``
Need
I
say
,
of
you
?
''
``
Of
*NL*
me
!
''
answered
Sophia
:
``
Hath
Mr
Jones
,
then
,
any
such
important
*NL*
business
with
me
?
''
--
``
To
some
,
madam
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
this
might
seem
an
*NL*
important
business
''
-LRB-
giving
her
the
pocket-book
-RRB-
.
``
I
hope
,
madam
,
you
*NL*
will
find
it
of
the
same
value
as
when
it
was
lost
.
''
Sophia
took
the
*NL*
pocket-book
,
and
was
going
to
speak
,
when
he
interrupted
her
*NL*
thus
:
--
``
Let
us
not
,
I
beseech
you
,
lose
one
of
these
precious
moments
*NL*
which
fortune
hath
so
kindly
sent
us
.
O
,
my
Sophia
!
I
have
business
of
*NL*
a
much
superior
kind
.
Thus
,
on
my
knees
,
let
me
ask
your
pardon
.
''
--
``
My
*NL*
pardon
!
''
cries
she
;
``
Sure
,
sir
,
after
what
is
past
,
you
can
not
expect
,
*NL*
after
what
I
have
heard
.
''
--
``
I
scarce
know
what
I
say
,
''
answered
Jones
.
*NL*
``
By
heavens
!
I
scarce
wish
you
should
pardon
me
.
O
my
Sophia
!
*NL*
henceforth
never
cast
away
a
thought
on
such
a
wretch
as
I
am
.
If
any
*NL*
remembrance
of
me
should
ever
intrude
to
give
a
moment
's
uneasiness
to
*NL*
that
tender
bosom
,
think
of
my
unworthiness
;
and
let
the
remembrance
*NL*
of
what
passed
at
Upton
blot
me
for
ever
from
your
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
stood
trembling
all
this
while
.
Her
face
was
whiter
than
snow
,
*NL*
and
her
heart
was
throbbing
through
her
stays
.
But
,
at
the
mention
of
*NL*
Upton
,
a
blush
arose
in
her
cheeks
,
and
her
eyes
,
which
before
she
had
*NL*
scarce
lifted
up
,
were
turned
upon
Jones
with
a
glance
of
disdain
.
He
*NL*
understood
this
silent
reproach
,
and
replied
to
it
thus
:
``
O
my
Sophia
!
*NL*
my
only
love
!
you
can
not
hate
or
despise
me
more
for
what
happened
*NL*
there
than
I
do
myself
;
but
yet
do
me
the
justice
to
think
that
my
*NL*
heart
was
never
unfaithful
to
you
.
That
had
no
share
in
the
folly
I
*NL*
was
guilty
of
;
it
was
even
then
unalterably
yours
.
Though
I
despaired
*NL*
of
possessing
you
,
nay
,
almost
of
ever
seeing
you
more
,
I
doated
still
*NL*
on
your
charming
idea
,
and
could
seriously
love
no
other
woman
.
But
if
*NL*
my
heart
had
not
been
engaged
,
she
,
into
whose
company
I
accidently
*NL*
fell
at
that
cursed
place
,
was
not
an
object
of
serious
love
.
Believe
*NL*
me
,
my
angel
,
I
never
have
seen
her
from
that
day
to
this
;
and
never
*NL*
intend
or
desire
to
see
her
again
.
''
Sophia
,
in
her
heart
,
was
very
*NL*
glad
to
hear
this
;
but
forcing
into
her
face
an
air
of
more
coldness
*NL*
than
she
had
yet
assumed
,
``
Why
,
''
said
she
,
``
Mr
Jones
,
do
you
take
the
*NL*
trouble
to
make
a
defence
where
you
are
not
accused
?
If
I
thought
it
*NL*
worth
while
to
accuse
you
,
I
have
a
charge
of
unpardonable
nature
*NL*
indeed
.
''
--
``
What
is
it
,
for
heaven
's
sake
?
''
answered
Jones
,
trembling
*NL*
and
pale
,
expecting
to
hear
of
his
amour
with
Lady
Bellaston
.
``
Oh
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
``
how
is
it
possible
!
can
everything
noble
and
everything
*NL*
base
be
lodged
together
in
the
same
bosom
?
''
Lady
Bellaston
,
and
the
*NL*
ignominious
circumstance
of
having
been
kept
,
rose
again
in
his
mind
,
*NL*
and
stopt
his
mouth
from
any
reply
.
``
Could
I
have
expected
,
''
proceeded
*NL*
Sophia
,
``
such
treatment
from
you
?
Nay
,
from
any
gentleman
,
from
any
*NL*
man
of
honour
?
To
have
my
name
traduced
in
public
;
in
inns
,
among
the
*NL*
meanest
vulgar
!
to
have
any
little
favours
that
my
unguarded
heart
may
*NL*
have
too
lightly
betrayed
me
to
grant
,
boasted
of
there
!
nay
,
even
to
*NL*
hear
that
you
had
been
forced
to
fly
from
my
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
equal
Jones
's
surprize
at
these
words
of
Sophia
;
but
*NL*
yet
,
not
being
guilty
,
he
was
much
less
embarrassed
how
to
defend
*NL*
himself
than
if
she
had
touched
that
tender
string
at
which
his
*NL*
conscience
had
been
alarmed
.
By
some
examination
he
presently
found
,
*NL*
that
her
supposing
him
guilty
of
so
shocking
an
outrage
against
his
*NL*
love
,
and
her
reputation
,
was
entirely
owing
to
Partridge
's
talk
at
*NL*
the
inns
before
landlords
and
servants
;
for
Sophia
confessed
to
him
it
*NL*
was
from
them
that
she
received
her
intelligence
.
He
had
no
very
great
*NL*
difficulty
to
make
her
believe
that
he
was
entirely
innocent
of
an
*NL*
offence
so
foreign
to
his
character
;
but
she
had
a
great
deal
to
*NL*
hinder
him
from
going
instantly
home
,
and
putting
Partridge
to
death
,
*NL*
which
he
more
than
once
swore
he
would
do
.
This
point
being
cleared
*NL*
up
,
they
soon
found
themselves
so
well
pleased
with
each
other
,
that
*NL*
Jones
quite
forgot
he
had
begun
the
conversation
with
conjuring
her
to
*NL*
give
up
all
thoughts
of
him
;
and
she
was
in
a
temper
to
have
given
ear
*NL*
to
a
petition
of
a
very
different
nature
;
for
before
they
were
aware
*NL*
they
had
both
gone
so
far
,
that
he
let
fall
some
words
that
sounded
*NL*
like
a
proposal
of
marriage
.
To
which
she
replied
,
``
That
,
did
not
her
*NL*
duty
to
her
father
forbid
her
to
follow
her
own
inclinations
,
ruin
*NL*
with
him
would
be
more
welcome
to
her
than
the
most
affluent
fortune
*NL*
with
another
man
.
''
At
the
mention
of
the
word
ruin
,
he
started
,
let
*NL*
drop
her
hand
,
which
he
had
held
for
some
time
,
and
striking
his
*NL*
breast
with
his
own
,
cried
out
,
``
Oh
,
Sophia
!
can
I
then
ruin
thee
?
No
;
*NL*
by
heavens
,
no
!
I
never
will
act
so
base
a
part
.
Dearest
Sophia
,
*NL*
whatever
it
costs
me
,
I
will
renounce
you
;
I
will
give
you
up
;
I
will
*NL*
tear
all
such
hopes
from
my
heart
as
are
inconsistent
with
your
real
*NL*
good
.
My
love
I
will
ever
retain
,
but
it
shall
be
in
silence
;
it
shall
*NL*
be
at
a
distance
from
you
;
it
shall
be
in
some
foreign
land
;
from
*NL*
whence
no
voice
,
no
sigh
of
my
despair
,
shall
ever
reach
and
disturb
*NL*
your
ears
.
And
when
I
am
dead
''
--
He
would
have
gone
on
,
but
was
stopt
*NL*
by
a
flood
of
tears
which
Sophia
let
fall
in
his
bosom
,
upon
which
she
*NL*
leaned
,
without
being
able
to
speak
one
word
.
He
kissed
them
off
,
*NL*
which
,
for
some
moments
,
she
allowed
him
to
do
without
any
resistance
;
*NL*
but
then
recollecting
herself
,
gently
withdrew
out
of
his
arms
;
and
,
*NL*
to
turn
the
discourse
from
a
subject
too
tender
,
and
which
she
found
*NL*
she
could
not
support
,
bethought
herself
to
ask
him
a
question
she
*NL*
never
had
time
to
put
to
him
before
,
``
How
he
came
into
that
room
?
''
He
*NL*
began
to
stammer
,
and
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
raised
her
*NL*
suspicions
by
the
answer
he
was
going
to
give
,
when
,
at
once
,
the
door
*NL*
opened
,
and
in
came
Lady
Bellaston
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
advanced
a
few
steps
,
and
seeing
Jones
and
Sophia
together
,
she
*NL*
suddenly
stopt
;
when
,
after
a
pause
of
a
few
moments
,
recollecting
*NL*
herself
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
,
she
said
--
though
with
*NL*
sufficient
indications
of
surprize
both
in
voice
and
countenance
--
``
I
*NL*
thought
,
Miss
Western
,
you
had
been
at
the
play
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Sophia
had
no
opportunity
of
learning
of
Jones
by
what
means
he
*NL*
had
discovered
her
,
yet
,
as
she
had
not
the
least
suspicion
of
the
*NL*
real
truth
,
or
that
Jones
and
Lady
Bellaston
were
acquainted
,
so
she
*NL*
was
very
little
confounded
;
and
the
less
,
as
the
lady
had
,
in
all
*NL*
their
conversations
on
the
subject
,
entirely
taken
her
side
against
*NL*
her
father
.
With
very
little
hesitation
,
therefore
,
she
went
through
*NL*
the
whole
story
of
what
had
happened
at
the
play-house
,
and
the
cause
*NL*
of
her
hasty
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
length
of
this
narrative
gave
Lady
Bellaston
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
rallying
her
spirits
,
and
of
considering
in
what
manner
to
act
.
And
as
*NL*
the
behaviour
of
Sophia
gave
her
hopes
that
Jones
had
not
betrayed
*NL*
her
,
she
put
on
an
air
of
good
humour
,
and
said
,
``
I
should
not
have
*NL*
broke
in
so
abruptly
upon
you
,
Miss
Western
,
if
I
had
known
you
had
*NL*
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
fixed
her
eyes
on
Sophia
whilst
she
spoke
these
words
.
*NL*
To
which
that
poor
young
lady
,
having
her
face
overspread
with
blushes
*NL*
and
confusion
,
answered
,
in
a
stammering
voice
,
``
I
am
sure
,
madam
,
I
*NL*
shall
always
think
the
honour
of
your
ladyship
's
company
--
''
``
I
hope
,
*NL*
at
least
,
''
cries
Lady
Bellaston
,
``
I
interrupt
no
business
.
''
--
``
No
,
*NL*
madam
,
''
answered
Sophia
,
``
our
business
was
at
an
end
.
Your
ladyship
*NL*
may
be
pleased
to
remember
I
have
often
mentioned
the
loss
of
my
*NL*
pocket-book
,
which
this
gentleman
,
having
very
luckily
found
,
was
so
*NL*
kind
to
return
it
to
me
with
the
bill
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
ever
since
the
arrival
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
had
been
ready
to
*NL*
sink
with
fear
.
He
sat
kicking
his
heels
,
playing
with
his
fingers
,
*NL*
and
looking
more
like
a
fool
,
if
it
be
possible
,
than
a
young
booby
*NL*
squire
,
when
he
is
first
introduced
into
a
polite
assembly
.
He
began
,
*NL*
however
,
now
to
recover
himself
;
and
taking
a
hint
from
the
behaviour
*NL*
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
he
saw
did
not
intend
to
claim
any
acquaintance
*NL*
with
him
,
he
resolved
as
entirely
to
affect
the
stranger
on
his
part
.
*NL*
He
said
,
``
Ever
since
he
had
the
pocket-book
in
his
possession
,
he
had
*NL*
used
great
diligence
in
enquiring
out
the
lady
whose
name
was
writ
in
*NL*
it
;
but
never
till
that
day
could
be
so
fortunate
to
discover
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
had
indeed
mentioned
the
loss
of
her
pocket-book
to
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
;
but
as
Jones
,
for
some
reason
or
other
,
had
never
once
*NL*
hinted
to
her
that
it
was
in
his
possession
,
she
believed
not
one
*NL*
syllable
of
what
Sophia
now
said
,
and
wonderfully
admired
the
extreme
*NL*
quickness
of
the
young
lady
in
inventing
such
an
excuse
.
The
reason
of
*NL*
Sophia
's
leaving
the
playhouse
met
with
no
better
credit
;
and
though
*NL*
she
could
not
account
for
the
meeting
between
these
two
lovers
,
she
*NL*
was
firmly
persuaded
it
was
not
accidental
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
an
affected
smile
,
therefore
,
she
said
,
``
Indeed
,
Miss
Western
,
*NL*
you
have
had
very
good
luck
in
recovering
your
money
.
Not
only
as
it
*NL*
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
gentleman
of
honour
,
but
as
he
happened
to
*NL*
discover
to
whom
it
belonged
.
I
think
you
would
not
consent
to
have
it
*NL*
advertised
.
--
It
was
great
good
fortune
,
sir
,
that
you
found
out
to
*NL*
whom
the
note
belonged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
madam
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
it
was
enclosed
in
a
pocket-book
,
in
which
*NL*
the
young
lady
's
name
was
written
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
very
fortunate
,
indeed
,
''
cries
the
lady
:
--
``
And
it
was
no
*NL*
less
so
,
that
you
heard
Miss
Western
was
at
my
house
;
for
she
is
very
*NL*
little
known
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
at
length
perfectly
recovered
his
spirits
;
and
as
he
*NL*
conceived
he
had
now
an
opportunity
of
satisfying
Sophia
as
to
the
*NL*
question
she
had
asked
him
just
before
Lady
Bellaston
came
in
,
he
*NL*
proceeded
thus
:
``
Why
,
madam
,
''
answered
he
,
``
it
was
by
the
luckiest
*NL*
chance
imaginable
I
made
this
discovery
.
I
was
mentioning
what
I
had
*NL*
found
,
and
the
name
of
the
owner
,
the
other
night
to
a
lady
at
the
*NL*
masquerade
,
who
told
me
she
believed
she
knew
where
I
might
see
Miss
*NL*
Western
;
and
if
I
would
come
to
her
house
the
next
morning
she
would
*NL*
inform
me
,
I
went
according
to
her
appointment
,
but
she
was
not
at
*NL*
home
;
nor
could
I
ever
meet
with
her
till
this
morning
,
when
she
*NL*
directed
me
to
your
ladyship
's
house
.
I
came
accordingly
,
and
did
*NL*
myself
the
honour
to
ask
for
your
ladyship
;
and
upon
my
saying
that
I
*NL*
had
very
particular
business
,
a
servant
showed
me
into
this
room
;
*NL*
where
I
had
not
been
long
before
the
young
lady
returned
from
the
*NL*
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
his
mentioning
the
masquerade
,
he
looked
very
slily
at
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
,
without
any
fear
of
being
remarked
by
Sophia
;
for
she
was
*NL*
visibly
too
much
confounded
to
make
any
observations
.
This
hint
a
*NL*
little
alarmed
the
lady
,
and
she
was
silent
;
when
Jones
,
who
saw
the
*NL*
agitation
of
Sophia
's
mind
,
resolved
to
take
the
only
method
of
*NL*
relieving
her
,
which
was
by
retiring
;
but
,
before
he
did
this
,
he
*NL*
said
,
``
I
believe
,
madam
,
it
is
customary
to
give
some
reward
on
these
*NL*
occasions
;
--
I
must
insist
on
a
very
high
one
for
my
honesty
;
--
it
is
,
*NL*
madam
,
no
less
than
the
honour
of
being
permitted
to
pay
another
visit
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
replied
the
lady
,
``
I
make
no
doubt
that
you
are
a
gentleman
,
*NL*
and
my
doors
are
never
shut
to
people
of
fashion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
then
,
after
proper
ceremonials
,
departed
,
highly
to
his
own
*NL*
satisfaction
,
and
no
less
to
that
of
Sophia
;
who
was
terribly
alarmed
*NL*
lest
Lady
Bellaston
should
discover
what
she
knew
already
but
too
*NL*
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
stairs
Jones
met
his
old
acquaintance
,
Mrs
Honour
,
who
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
all
she
had
said
against
him
,
was
now
so
well
bred
to
*NL*
behave
with
great
civility
.
This
meeting
proved
indeed
a
lucky
*NL*
circumstance
,
as
he
communicated
to
her
the
house
where
he
lodged
,
*NL*
with
which
Sophia
was
unacquainted
.

In

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
elegant
Lord
Shaftesbury
somewhere
objects
to
telling
too
much
*NL*
truth
:
by
which
it
may
be
fairly
inferred
,
that
,
in
some
cases
,
to
lie
*NL*
is
not
only
excusable
but
commendable
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
surely
there
are
no
persons
who
may
so
properly
challenge
a
right
*NL*
to
this
commendable
deviation
from
truth
,
as
young
women
in
the
affair
*NL*
of
love
;
for
which
they
may
plead
precept
,
education
,
and
above
all
,
*NL*
the
sanction
,
nay
,
I
may
say
the
necessity
of
custom
,
by
which
they
*NL*
are
restrained
,
not
from
submitting
to
the
honest
impulses
of
nature
*NL*
-LRB-
for
that
would
be
a
foolish
prohibition
-RRB-
,
but
from
owning
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
not
,
therefore
,
ashamed
to
say
,
that
our
heroine
now
pursued
*NL*
the
dictates
of
the
above-mentioned
right
honourable
philosopher
.
As
*NL*
she
was
perfectly
satisfied
then
,
that
Lady
Bellaston
was
ignorant
of
*NL*
the
person
of
Jones
,
so
she
determined
to
keep
her
in
that
ignorance
,
*NL*
though
at
the
expense
of
a
little
fibbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
not
been
long
gone
,
before
Lady
Bellaston
cryed
,
``
Upon
my
*NL*
word
,
a
good
pretty
young
fellow
;
I
wonder
who
he
is
;
for
I
do
n't
*NL*
remember
ever
to
have
seen
his
face
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
neither
,
madam
,
''
cries
Sophia
.
``
I
must
say
he
behaved
very
*NL*
handsomely
in
relation
to
my
note
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
he
is
a
very
handsome
fellow
,
''
said
the
lady
:
``
do
n't
you
*NL*
think
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
take
much
notice
of
him
,
''
answered
Sophia
,
``
but
I
thought
*NL*
he
seemed
rather
awkward
,
and
ungenteel
than
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
extremely
right
,
''
cries
Lady
Bellaston
:
``
you
may
see
,
by
his
*NL*
manner
,
that
he
hath
not
kept
good
company
.
Nay
,
notwithstanding
his
*NL*
returning
your
note
,
and
refusing
the
reward
,
I
almost
question
*NL*
whether
he
is
a
gentleman
.
--
I
have
always
observed
there
is
a
*NL*
something
in
persons
well
born
,
which
others
can
never
acquire
.
--
I
*NL*
think
I
will
give
orders
not
to
be
at
home
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

sure
,
madam
,
''
answered
Sophia
,
``
one
ca
n't
suspect
after
what
he
*NL*
hath
done
;
--
besides
,
if
your
ladyship
observed
him
,
there
was
an
*NL*
elegance
in
his
discourse
,
a
delicacy
,
a
prettiness
of
expression
*NL*
that
,
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
''
said
Lady
Bellaston
,
``
the
fellow
hath
words

And
*NL*
indeed

Sophia
,
you
must
forgive
me
,
indeed
you
must

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgive
your
ladyship

''
said
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
you
must
,
''
answered
she
,
laughing
;
``
for
I
had
a
horrible
*NL*
suspicion
when
I
first
came
into
the
room
--
I
vow
you
must
forgive
*NL*
it
;
but
I
suspected
it
was
Mr
Jones
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
your
ladyship
,
indeed
?
''
cries
Sophia
,
blushing
,
and
affecting
a
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
vow
I
did

''
answered
she
.
``
I
ca
n't
imagine
what
put
it
into
my

head

give
the

his

he
was
genteely
drest
;
which
,
I
*NL*
think
,
dear
Sophy
,
is
not
commonly
the
case
with
your
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
raillery
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
``
is
a
little
cruel
,
Lady
Bellaston
,
*NL*
after
my
promise
to
your
ladyship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
child
,
''
said
the
lady
;
--
``
It
would
have
been
cruel
*NL*
before
;
but
after
you
have
promised
me
never
to
marry
without
your
*NL*
father
's
consent
,
in
which
you
know
is
implied
your
giving
up
Jones
,
*NL*
sure
you
can
bear
a
little
raillery
on
a
passion
which
was
pardonable
*NL*
enough
in
a
young
girl
in
the
country
,
and
of
which
you
tell
me
you
*NL*
have
so
entirely
got
the
better
.
What
must
I
think
,
my
dear
Sophy
,
if
*NL*
you
can
not
bear
a
little
ridicule
even
on
his
dress
?
I
shall
begin
to
*NL*
fear
you
are
very
far
gone
indeed
;
and
almost
question
whether
you
*NL*
have
dealt
ingenuously
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
``
your

mistakes
me

if
you

imagine
I
had
any
concern

*NL*
*NL*
``
On
his
account
!
''
answered
the
lady
:
``
You
must
have
mistaken
me
;
I
*NL*
went
no
farther
than
his
dress
;
--
for
I
would
not
injure
your
taste
*NL*
by
any
other
comparison
--
I
do
n't
imagine
,
my
dear
Sophy
,
if
your
Mr
*NL*
Jones
had
been
such
a
fellow
as
this
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
your
ladyship
had
allowed
him
to
be
*NL*
handsome
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
,
pray
?
''
cried
the
lady
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr
Jones
,
''
answered
Sophia
;
--
and
immediately
recollecting
herself
,
*NL*
``
Mr
Jones
!
--
no
,
no
;
I
ask
your
pardon
;

I
mean
the
gentleman
who
was
*NL*
just
now
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Sophy
!
Sophy
!
''
cries
the
lady
;
``
this
Mr
Jones
,
I
am
afraid
,
still
*NL*
runs
in
your
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
upon
my
honour
,
madam
,
''
said
Sophia
,
``
Mr
Jones
is
as
entirely
*NL*
indifferent
to
me
,
as
the
gentleman
who
just
now
left
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
honour
,
''
said
Lady
Bellaston
,
``
I
believe
it
.
Forgive
me
,
*NL*
therefore
,
a
little
innocent
raillery
;
but
I
promise
you
I
will
never
*NL*
mention
his
name
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
two
ladies
separated
,
infinitely
more
to
the
delight
of
*NL*
Sophia
than
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
would
willingly
have
tormented
her
*NL*
rival
a
little
longer
,
had
not
business
of
more
importance
called
her
*NL*
away
.
As
for
Sophia
,
her
mind
was
not
perfectly
easy
under
this
first
*NL*
practice
of
deceit
;
upon
which
,
when
she
retired
to
her
chamber
,
she
*NL*
reflected
with
the
highest
uneasiness
and
conscious
shame
.
Nor
could
*NL*
the
peculiar
hardship
of
her
situation
,
and
the
necessity
of
the
case
,
*NL*
at
all
reconcile
her
mind
to
her
conduct
;
for
the
frame
of
her
mind
*NL*
was
too
delicate
to
bear
the
thought
of
having
been
guilty
of
a
*NL*
falsehood
,
however
qualified
by
circumstances
.
Nor
did
this
thought
*NL*
once
suffer
her
to
close
her
eyes
during
the
whole
succeeding
night

i

*NL*
*NL*
An
essay
to
prove
that
an
author
will
write
the
better
for
having
some
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
subject
on
which
he
writes
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
several
gentlemen
in
these
times
,
by
the
wonderful
force
of
genius
*NL*
only
,
without
the
least
assistance
of
learning
,
perhaps
,
without
being
*NL*
well
able
to
read
,
have
made
a
considerable
figure
in
the
republic
of
*NL*
letters
;
the
modern
critics
,
I
am
told
,
have
lately
begun
to
assert
,
*NL*
that
all
kind
of
learning
is
entirely
useless
to
a
writer
;
and
,
*NL*
indeed
,
no
other
than
a
kind
of
fetters
on
the
natural
sprightliness
*NL*
and
activity
of
the
imagination
,
which
is
thus
weighed
down
,
and
*NL*
prevented
from
soaring
to
those
high
flights
which
otherwise
it
would
*NL*
be
able
to
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
doctrine
,
I
am
afraid
,
is
at
present
carried
much
too
far
:
for
*NL*
why
should
writing
differ
so
much
from
all
other
arts
?
The
nimbleness
*NL*
of
a
dancing-master
is
not
at
all
prejudiced
by
being
taught
to
move
;
*NL*
nor
doth
any
mechanic
,
I
believe
,
exercise
his
tools
the
worse
by
*NL*
having
learnt
to
use
them
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
can
not
conceive
that
*NL*
Homer
or
Virgil
would
have
writ
with
more
fire
,
if
instead
of
being
*NL*
masters
of
all
the
learning
of
their
times
,
they
had
been
as
ignorant
*NL*
as
most
of
the
authors
of
the
present
age
.
Nor
do
I
believe
that
all
*NL*
the
imagination
,
fire
,
and
judgment
of
Pitt
,
could
have
produced
those
*NL*
orations
that
have
made
the
senate
of
England
,
in
these
our
times
,
a
*NL*
rival
in
eloquence
to
Greece
and
Rome
,
if
he
had
not
been
so
well
read
*NL*
in
the
writings
of
Demosthenes
and
Cicero
,
as
to
have
transferred
*NL*
their
whole
spirit
into
his
speeches
,
and
,
with
their
spirit
,
their
*NL*
knowledge
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
here
be
understood
to
insist
on
the
same
fund
of
learning
*NL*
in
any
of
my
brethren
,
as
Cicero
persuades
us
is
necessary
to
the
*NL*
composition
of
an
orator
.
On
the
contrary
,
very
little
reading
is
,
I
*NL*
conceive
,
necessary
to
the
poet
,
less
to
the
critic
,
and
the
least
of
*NL*
all
to
the
politician
.
For
the
first
,
perhaps
,
Byshe
's
Art
of
Poetry
,
*NL*
and
a
few
of
our
modern
poets
,
may
suffice
;
for
the
second
,
a
moderate
*NL*
heap
of
plays
;
and
,
for
the
last
,
an
indifferent
collection
of
*NL*
political
journals
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
I
require
no
more
than
that
a
man
should
have
some
*NL*
little
knowledge
of
the
subject
on
which
he
treats
,
according
to
the
*NL*
old
maxim
of
law
,
_
Quam
quisque
norit
artem
in
ea
se
exerceat
_
.
With
*NL*
this
alone
a
writer
may
sometimes
do
tolerably
well
;
and
,
indeed
,
*NL*
without
this
,
all
the
other
learning
in
the
world
will
stand
him
in
*NL*
little
stead
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
instance
,
let
us
suppose
that
Homer
and
Virgil
,
Aristotle
and
*NL*
Cicero
,
Thucydides
and
Livy
,
could
have
met
all
together
,
and
have
*NL*
clubbed
their
several
talents
to
have
composed
a
treatise
on
the
art
*NL*
of
dancing
:
I
believe
it
will
be
readily
agreed
they
could
not
have
*NL*
equalled
the
excellent
treatise
which
Mr
Essex
hath
given
us
on
that
*NL*
subject
,
entitled
,
The
Rudiments
of
Genteel
Education
.
And
,
indeed
,
*NL*
should
the
excellent
Mr
Broughton
be
prevailed
on
to
set
fist
to
*NL*
paper
,
and
to
complete
the
above-said
rudiments
,
by
delivering
down
*NL*
the
true
principles
of
athletics
,
I
question
whether
the
world
will
*NL*
have
any
cause
to
lament
,
that
none
of
the
great
writers
,
either
*NL*
antient
or
modern
,
have
ever
treated
about
that
noble
and
useful
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
avoid
a
multiplicity
of
examples
in
so
plain
a
case
,
and
to
come
at
*NL*
once
to
my
point
,
I
am
apt
to
conceive
,
that
one
reason
why
many
*NL*
English
writers
have
totally
failed
in
describing
the
manners
of
upper
*NL*
life
,
may
possibly
be
,
that
in
reality
they
know
nothing
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
a
knowledge
unhappily
not
in
the
power
of
many
authors
to
*NL*
arrive
at
.
Books
will
give
us
a
very
imperfect
idea
of
it
;
nor
will
*NL*
the
stage
a
much
better
:
the
fine
gentleman
formed
upon
reading
the
*NL*
former
will
almost
always
turn
out
a
pedant
,
and
he
who
forms
himself
*NL*
upon
the
latter
,
a
coxcomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
are
the
characters
drawn
from
these
models
better
supported
.
*NL*
Vanbrugh
and
Congreve
copied
nature
;
but
they
who
copy
them
draw
as
*NL*
unlike
the
present
age
as
Hogarth
would
do
if
he
was
to
paint
a
rout
*NL*
or
a
drum
in
the
dresses
of
Titian
and
of
Vandyke
.
In
short
,
imitation
*NL*
here
will
not
do
the
business
.
The
picture
must
be
after
Nature
*NL*
herself
.
A
true
knowledge
of
the
world
is
gained
only
by
conversation
,
*NL*
and
the
manners
of
every
rank
must
be
seen
in
order
to
be
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
happens
that
this
higher
order
of
mortals
is
not
to
be
seen
,
*NL*
like
all
the
rest
of
the
human
species
,
for
nothing
,
in
the
streets
,
*NL*
shops
,
and
coffee-houses
;
nor
are
they
shown
,
like
the
upper
rank
of
*NL*
animals
,
for
so
much
a-piece
.
In
short
,
this
is
a
sight
to
which
no
*NL*
persons
are
admitted
without
one
or
other
of
these
qualifications
,
*NL*
viz.
,
either
birth
or
fortune
,
or
,
what
is
equivalent
to
both
,
the
*NL*
honourable
profession
of
a
gamester
.
And
,
very
unluckily
for
the
*NL*
world
,
persons
so
qualified
very
seldom
care
to
take
upon
themselves
*NL*
the
bad
trade
of
writing
;
which
is
generally
entered
upon
by
the
lower
*NL*
and
poorer
sort
,
as
it
is
a
trade
which
many
think
requires
no
kind
of
*NL*
stock
to
set
up
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
those
strange
monsters
in
lace
and
embroidery
,
in
silks
and
*NL*
brocades
,
with
vast
wigs
and
hoops
;
which
,
under
the
name
of
lords
and
*NL*
ladies
,
strut
the
stage
,
to
the
great
delight
of
attorneys
and
their
*NL*
clerks
in
the
pit
,
and
of
the
citizens
and
their
apprentices
in
the
*NL*
galleries
;
and
which
are
no
more
to
be
found
in
real
life
than
the
*NL*
centaur
,
the
chimera
,
or
any
other
creature
of
mere
fiction
.
But
to
*NL*
let
my
reader
into
a
secret
,
this
knowledge
of
upper
life
,
though
very
*NL*
necessary
for
preventing
mistakes
,
is
no
very
great
resource
to
a
*NL*
writer
whose
province
is
comedy
,
or
that
kind
of
novels
which
,
like
*NL*
this
I
am
writing
,
is
of
the
comic
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Mr
Pope
says
of
women
is
very
applicable
to
most
in
this
station
,
*NL*
who
are
,
indeed
,
so
entirely
made
up
of
form
and
affectation
,
that
*NL*
they
have
no
character
at
all
,
at
least
none
which
appears
.
I
will
*NL*
venture
to
say
the
highest
life
is
much
the
dullest
,
and
affords
very
*NL*
little
humour
or
entertainment
.
The
various
callings
in
lower
spheres
*NL*
produce
the
great
variety
of
humorous
characters
;
whereas
here
,
except
*NL*
among
the
few
who
are
engaged
in
the
pursuit
of
ambition
,
and
the
*NL*
fewer
still
who
have
a
relish
for
pleasure
,
all
is
vanity
and
servile
*NL*
imitation
.
Dressing
and
cards
,
eating
and
drinking
,
bowing
and
*NL*
courtesying
,
make
up
the
business
of
their
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
there
are
,
however
,
of
this
rank
upon
whom
passion
exercises
its
*NL*
tyranny
,
and
hurries
them
far
beyond
the
bounds
which
decorum
*NL*
prescribes
;
of
these
the
ladies
are
as
much
distinguished
by
their
*NL*
noble
intrepidity
,
and
a
certain
superior
contempt
of
reputation
,
from
*NL*
the
frail
ones
of
meaner
degree
,
as
a
virtuous
woman
of
quality
is
by
*NL*
the
elegance
and
delicacy
of
her
sentiments
from
the
honest
wife
of
a
*NL*
yeoman
and
shopkeeper
.
Lady
Bellaston
was
of
this
intrepid
character
;
*NL*
but
let
not
my
country
readers
conclude
from
her
,
that
this
is
the
*NL*
general
conduct
of
women
of
fashion
,
or
that
we
mean
to
represent
them
*NL*
as
such
.
They
might
as
well
suppose
that
every
clergyman
was
*NL*
represented
by
Thwackum
,
or
every
soldier
by
ensign
Northerton
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
not
,
indeed
,
a
greater
error
than
that
which
universally
*NL*
prevails
among
the
vulgar
,
who
,
borrowing
their
opinion
from
some
*NL*
ignorant
satirists
,
have
affixed
the
character
of
lewdness
to
these
*NL*
times
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
convinced
there
never
was
less
of
love
*NL*
intrigue
carried
on
among
persons
of
condition
than
now
.
Our
present
*NL*
women
have
been
taught
by
their
mothers
to
fix
their
thoughts
only
on
*NL*
ambition
and
vanity
,
and
to
despise
the
pleasures
of
love
as
unworthy
*NL*
their
regard
;
and
being
afterwards
,
by
the
care
of
such
mothers
,
*NL*
married
without
having
husbands
,
they
seem
pretty
well
confirmed
in
*NL*
the
justness
of
those
sentiments
;
whence
they
content
themselves
,
for
*NL*
the
dull
remainder
of
life
,
with
the
pursuit
of
more
innocent
,
but
I
*NL*
am
afraid
more
childish
amusements
,
the
bare
mention
of
which
would
*NL*
ill
suit
with
the
dignity
of
this
history
.
In
my
humble
opinion
,
the
*NL*
true
characteristic
of
the
present
beau
monde
is
rather
folly
than
*NL*
vice
,
and
the
only
epithet
which
it
deserves
is
that
of
frivolous
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
not
been
long
at
home
before
he
received
the
following
*NL*
letter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
never
more
surprized
than
when
I
found
you
was
gone
.
When
you
*NL*
left
the
room
I
little
imagined
you
intended
to
have
left
the
house
*NL*
without
seeing
me
again
.
Your
behaviour
is
all
of
a
piece
,
and
*NL*
convinces
me
how
much
I
ought
to
despise
a
heart
which
can
doat
upon
*NL*
an
idiot
;
though
I
know
not
whether
I
should
not
admire
her
cunning
*NL*
more
than
her
simplicity
:
wonderful
both
!
For
though
she
understood
*NL*
not
a
word
of
what
passed
between
us
,
yet
she
had
the
skill
,
the
*NL*
assurance
,
the
--
what
shall
I
call
it
?
to
deny
to
my
face
that
she
*NL*
knows
you
,
or
ever
saw
you
before
.
--
Was
this
a
scheme
laid
between
*NL*
you
,
and
have
you
been
base
enough
to
betray
me
?
--
O
how
I
despise
*NL*
her
,
you
,
and
all
the
world
,
but
chiefly
myself
!
for
--
I
dare
not
*NL*
write
what
I
should
afterwards
run
mad
to
read
;
but
remember
,
I
can
*NL*
detest
as
violently
as
I
have
loved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
but
little
time
given
him
to
reflect
on
this
letter
,
before
*NL*
a
second
was
brought
him
from
the
same
hand
;
and
this
,
likewise
,
we
*NL*
shall
set
down
in
the
precise
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
consider
the
hurry
of
spirits
in
which
I
must
have
writ
,
*NL*
you
can
not
be
surprized
at
any
expressions
in
my
former
note
.
--
Yet
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
on
reflection
,
they
were
rather
too
warm
.
At
least
I
would
,
*NL*
if
possible
,
think
all
owing
to
the
odious
playhouse
,
and
to
the
*NL*
impertinence
of
a
fool
,
which
detained
me
beyond
my
*NL*
appointment
.
--
How
easy
is
it
to
think
well
of
those
we
*NL*
love
!
--
Perhaps
you
desire
I
should
think
so
.
I
have
resolved
to
*NL*
see
you
to-night
;
so
come
to
me
immediately
.
*NL*

P.S.

have
ordered
to
be
at

none

yourself

_
P.S.
_
--
Mr
Jones
will
imagine
I
shall
assist
him
in
his
defence
;
*NL*
for
I
believe
he
can
not
desire
to
impose
on
me
more
than
I
desire
to
*NL*
impose
on
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
P.S.
_
--
Come
immediately

''
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
men
of
intrigue
I
refer
the
determination
,
whether
the
angry
or
*NL*
the
tender
letter
gave
the
greatest
uneasiness
to
Jones
.
Certain
it
*NL*
is
,
he
had
no
violent
inclination
to
pay
any
more
visits
that
evening
,
*NL*
unless
to
one
single
person
.
However
,
he
thought
his
honour
engaged
,
*NL*
and
had
not
this
been
motive
sufficient
,
he
would
not
have
ventured
to
*NL*
blow
the
temper
of
Lady
Bellaston
into
that
flame
of
which
he
had
*NL*
reason
to
think
it
susceptible
,
and
of
which
he
feared
the
consequence
*NL*
might
be
a
discovery
to
Sophia
,
which
he
dreaded
.
After
some
*NL*
discontented
walks
therefore
about
the
room
,
he
was
preparing
to
*NL*
depart
,
when
the
lady
kindly
prevented
him
,
not
by
another
letter
,
but
*NL*
by
her
own
presence
.
She
entered
the
room
very
disordered
in
her
*NL*
dress
,
and
very
discomposed
in
her
looks
,
and
threw
herself
into
a
*NL*
chair
,
where
,
having
recovered
her
breath
,
she
said
--
``
You
see
,
sir
,
*NL*
when
women
have
gone
one
length
too
far
,
they
will
stop
at
none
.
If
*NL*
any
person
would
have
sworn
this
to
me
a
week
ago
,
I
would
not
have
*NL*
believed
it
of
myself
.
''
``
I
hope
,
madam
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
my
charming
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
will
be
as
difficult
to
believe
anything
against
one
who
is
*NL*
so
sensible
of
the
many
obligations
she
hath
conferred
upon
him
.
''
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
says
she
,
``
sensible
of
obligations
!
Did
I
expect
to
hear
*NL*
such
cold
language
from
Mr
Jones
?
''
``
Pardon
me
,
my
dear
angel
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
if
,
after
the
letters
I
have
received
,
the
terrors
of
your
anger
,
*NL*
though
I
know
not
how
I
have
deserved
it
.
''
--
``
And
have
I
then
,
''
says
*NL*
she
,
with
a
smile
,
``
so
angry
a
countenance
?
--
Have
I
really
brought
a
*NL*
chiding
face
with
me
?

--
``
If
there
be
honour
in
man

said
he
,
``
I
have
*NL*
done
nothing
to
merit
your
anger

You
remember
the
appointment
you
*NL*
sent
me
;
I
went
in
pursuance
.
''
--
``
I
beseech
you

cried
she
,
``
do
not
*NL*
run
through
the
odious
recital
.
--
Answer
me
but
one
question
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
be
easy
.
Have
you
not
betrayed
my
honour
to
her
?
''
--
Jones
fell
*NL*
upon
his
knees
,
and
began
to
utter
the
most
violent
protestations
,
*NL*
when
Partridge
came
dancing
and
capering
into
the
room
,
like
one
drunk
*NL*
with
joy
,
crying
out
,
``
She
's
found

*NL*
she

``

cries
*NL*
Jones

so
damned

--
``
D

said
the
lady
,
as
she
went
to
her
place
*NL*
of
concealment
;
and
presently
afterwards
in
came
Mrs
Honour
.
*NL*
``
Hey-day

says
she
,
``
Mr
Jones
,
what
's
the
matter

That
impudent

would
scarce
let

upstairs

I
hope
he
hath
*NL*
not
the
same
reason
to
keep
me
from
you
as
he
had
at
Upton
.
--
I
suppose
*NL*
you
hardly
expected
to
see
me

you
have
certainly
bewitched
my

nothing

Jones
begged
her
only
to
whisper
,
for
that
there
was
*NL*
a
lady
dying
in
the
next
room

``

she
;
``

of

Jones

after
expressing

offered
to

*NL*
hastily
took
the
letter
,
and
presently
after
slipped
five
pieces
into
*NL*
her
hand
.
He
then
returned
a
thousand
thanks
to
his
dear
Sophia
in
a
*NL*
whisper
,
and
begged
her
to
leave
him
to
read
her
letter
:
she
presently
*NL*
departed
,
not
without
expressing
much
grateful
sense
of
his
*NL*
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
now
came
from
behind
the
curtain
.
How
shall
I
describe
*NL*
her
rage
?
Her
tongue
was
at
first
incapable
of
utterance
;
but
streams
*NL*
of
fire
darted
from
her
eyes
,
and
well
indeed
they
might
,
for
her
*NL*
heart
was
all
in
a
flame
.
And
now
as
soon
as
her
voice
found
way
,
*NL*
instead
of
expressing
any
indignation
against
Honour
or
her
own
*NL*
servants
,
she
began
to
attack
poor
Jones
.
``
You
see
,
''
said
she
,
``
what
I
*NL*
have
sacrificed
to
you
;
my
reputation
,
my
honour
--
gone
for
ever
!
And
*NL*
what
return
have
I
found
?
Neglected
,
slighted
for
a
country
girl
,
for
*NL*
an
idiot
.
''
--
``
What
neglect
,
madam
,
or
what
slight
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
have
*NL*
I
been
guilty
of
?
''
--
``
Mr
Jones
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
is
in
vain
to
dissemble
;
*NL*
if
you
will
make
me
easy
,
you
must
entirely
give
her
up
;
and
as
a
*NL*
proof
of
your
intention
,
show
me
the
letter
.
''
--
``
What
letter
,
madam
?
''
*NL*
said
Jones
.
``
Nay
,
surely
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
can
not
have
the
confidence
*NL*
to
deny
your
having
received
a
letter
by
the
hands
of
that
*NL*
trollop
.
''
--
``
And
can
your
ladyship
,
''
cries
he
,
``
ask
of
me
what
I
must
*NL*
part
with
my
honour
before
I
grant
?
Have
I
acted
in
such
a
manner
by
*NL*
your
ladyship
?
Could
I
be
guilty
of
betraying
this
poor
innocent
girl
*NL*
to
you
,
what
security
could
you
have
that
I
should
not
act
the
same
*NL*
part
by
yourself
?
A
moment
's
reflection
will
,
I
am
sure
,
convince
you
*NL*
that
a
man
with
whom
the
secrets
of
a
lady
are
not
safe
must
be
the
*NL*
most
contemptible
of
wretches
.
''
--
``
Very
well
,
''
said
she
--
``
I
need
not
*NL*
insist
on
your
becoming
this
contemptible
wretch
in
your
own
opinion
;
*NL*
for
the
inside
of
the
letter
could
inform
me
of
nothing
more
than
I
*NL*
know
already
.
I
see
the
footing
you
are
upon
.
''
--
Here
ensued
a
long
*NL*
conversation
,
which
the
reader
,
who
is
not
too
curious
,
will
thank
me
*NL*
for
not
inserting
at
length
.
It
shall
suffice
,
therefore
,
to
inform
*NL*
him
,
that
Lady
Bellaston
grew
more
and
more
pacified
,
and
at
length
*NL*
believed
,
or
affected
to
believe
,
his
protestations
,
that
his
meeting
*NL*
with
Sophia
that
evening
was
merely
accidental
,
and
every
other
matter
*NL*
which
the
reader
already
knows
,
and
which
,
as
Jones
set
before
her
in
*NL*
the
strongest
light
,
it
is
plain
that
she
had
in
reality
no
reason
to
*NL*
be
angry
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
,
however
,
in
her
heart
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
*NL*
refusal
to
show
her
the
letter
;
so
deaf
are
we
to
the
clearest
reason
,
*NL*
when
it
argues
against
our
prevailing
passions
.
She
was
,
indeed
,
well
*NL*
convinced
that
Sophia
possessed
the
first
place
in
Jones
's
affections
;
*NL*
and
yet
,
haughty
and
amorous
as
this
lady
was
,
she
submitted
at
last
*NL*
to
bear
the
second
place
;
or
,
to
express
it
more
properly
in
a
legal
*NL*
phrase
,
was
contented
with
the
possession
of
that
of
which
another
*NL*
woman
had
the
reversion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
length
agreed
that
Jones
should
for
the
future
visit
at
the
*NL*
house
:
for
that
Sophia
,
her
maid
,
and
all
the
servants
,
would
place
*NL*
these
visits
to
the
account
of
Sophia
;
and
that
she
herself
would
be
*NL*
considered
as
the
person
imposed
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
scheme
was
contrived
by
the
lady
,
and
highly
relished
by
Jones
,
*NL*
who
was
indeed
glad
to
have
a
prospect
of
seeing
his
Sophia
at
any
*NL*
rate
;
and
the
lady
herself
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
*NL*
imposition
on
Sophia
,
which
Jones
,
she
thought
,
could
not
possibly
*NL*
discover
to
her
for
his
own
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
appointed
for
the
first
visit
,
and
then
,
after
proper
*NL*
ceremonials
,
the
Lady
Bellaston
returned
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
various
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
no
sooner
alone
than
he
eagerly
broke
open
his
letter
,
and
*NL*
read
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
it
is
impossible
to
express
what
I
have
suffered
since
you
*NL*
left
this
house
;
and
as
I
have
reason
to
think
you
intend
coming
*NL*
here
again
,
I
have
sent
Honour
,
though
so
late
at
night
,
as
she
*NL*
tells
me
she
knows
your
lodgings
,
to
prevent
you
.
I
charge
you
,
by
*NL*
all
the
regard
you
have
for
me
,
not
to
think
of
visiting
here
;
for
*NL*
it
will
certainly
be
discovered
;
nay
,
I
almost
doubt
,
from
some
*NL*
things
which
have
dropt
from
her
ladyship
,
that
she
is
not
already
*NL*
without
some
suspicion
.
Something
favourable
perhaps
may
happen
;
we
*NL*
must
wait
with
patience
;
but
I
once
more
entreat
you
,
if
you
have
*NL*
any
concern
for
my
ease
,
do
not
think
of
returning
hither
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
administered
the
same
kind
of
consolation
to
poor
Jones
,
*NL*
which
Job
formerly
received
from
his
friends
.
Besides
disappointing
*NL*
all
the
hopes
which
he
promised
to
himself
from
seeing
Sophia
,
he
was
*NL*
reduced
to
an
unhappy
dilemma
,
with
regard
to
Lady
Bellaston
;
for
*NL*
there
are
some
certain
engagements
,
which
,
as
he
well
knew
,
do
very
*NL*
difficultly
admit
of
any
excuse
for
the
failure
;
and
to
go
,
after
the
*NL*
strict
prohibition
from
Sophia
,
he
was
not
to
be
forced
by
any
human
*NL*
power
.
At
length
,
after
much
deliberation
,
which
during
that
night
*NL*
supplied
the
place
of
sleep
,
he
determined
to
feign
himself
sick
:
for
*NL*
this
suggested
itself
as
the
only
means
of
failing
the
appointed
*NL*
visit
,
without
incensing
Lady
Bellaston
,
which
he
had
more
than
one
*NL*
reason
of
desiring
to
avoid
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
,
however
,
which
he
did
in
the
morning
,
was
,
to
write
*NL*
an
answer
to
Sophia
,
which
he
inclosed
in
one
to
Honour
.
He
then
*NL*
despatched
another
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
containing
the
above-mentioned
*NL*
excuse
;
and
to
this
he
soon
received
the
following
answer
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
vexed
that
I
can
not
see
you
here
this
afternoon
,
but
more
*NL*
concerned
for
the
occasion
;
take
great
care
of
yourself
,
and
have
*NL*
the
best
advice
,
and
I
hope
there
will
be
no
danger
.
--
I
am
so
*NL*
tormented
all
this
morning
with
fools
,
that
I
have
scarce
a
moment
's
*NL*
time
to
write
to
you
.
Adieu
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
P.S.
_
--
I
will
endeavour
to
call
on
you
this
evening
,
at
nine
.
--
Be
*NL*
sure
to
be
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
now
received
a
visit
from
Mrs
Miller
,
who
,
after
some
formal
*NL*
introduction
,
began
the
following
speech
:
--
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
sir
,
to
*NL*
wait
upon
you
on
such
an
occasion
;
but
I
hope
you
will
consider
the
*NL*
ill
consequence
which
it
must
be
to
the
reputation
of
my
poor
girls
,
*NL*
if
my
house
should
once
be
talked
of
as
a
house
of
ill-fame
.
I
hope
*NL*
you
wo
n't
think
me
,
therefore
,
guilty
of
impertinence
,
if
I
beg
you
*NL*
not
to
bring
any
more
ladies
in
at
that
time
of
night
.
The
clock
had
*NL*
struck
two
before
one
of
them
went
away
.
''
--
``
I
do
assure
you
,
madam
,
''
*NL*
said
Jones
,
``
the
lady
who
was
here
last
night
,
and
who
staid
the
*NL*
latest
-LRB-
for
the
other
only
brought
me
a
letter
-RRB-
,
is
a
woman
of
very
*NL*
great
fashion
,
and
my
near
relation
.
''
--
``
I
do
n't
know
what
fashion
she
*NL*
is
of
,
''
answered
Mrs
Miller
;
``
but
I
am
sure
no
woman
of
virtue
,
unless
*NL*
a
very
near
relation
indeed
,
would
visit
a
young
gentleman
at
ten
at
*NL*
night
,
and
stay
four
hours
in
his
room
with
him
alone
;
besides
,
sir
,
*NL*
the
behaviour
of
her
chairmen
shows
what
she
was
;
for
they
did
nothing
*NL*
but
make
jests
all
the
evening
in
the
entry
,
and
asked
Mr
Partridge
,
*NL*
in
the
hearing
of
my
own
maid
,
if
madam
intended
to
stay
with
his
*NL*
master
all
night
;
with
a
great
deal
of
stuff
not
proper
to
be
*NL*
repeated
.
I
have
really
a
great
respect
for
you
,
Mr
Jones
,
upon
your
*NL*
own
account
;
nay
,
I
have
a
very
high
obligation
to
you
for
your
*NL*
generosity
to
my
cousin
.
Indeed
,
I
did
not
know
how
very
good
you
had
*NL*
been
till
lately
.
Little
did
I
imagine
to
what
dreadful
courses
the
*NL*
poor
man
's
distress
had
driven
him
.
Little
did
I
think
,
when
you
gave
*NL*
me
the
ten
guineas
,
that
you
had
given
them
to
a
highwayman
!
O
*NL*
heavens
!
what
goodness
have
you
shown
!
How
have
you
preserved
this
*NL*
family
!
--
The
character
which
Mr
Allworthy
hath
formerly
given
me
of
*NL*
you
was
,
I
find
,
strictly
true
.
--
And
indeed
,
if
I
had
no
obligation
to
*NL*
you
,
my
obligations
to
him
are
such
,
that
,
on
his
account
,
I
should
*NL*
shew
you
the
utmost
respect
in
my
power
.
--
Nay
,
believe
me
,
dear
Mr
*NL*
Jones
,
if
my
daughters
'
and
my
own
reputation
were
out
of
the
case
,
I
*NL*
should
,
for
your
own
sake
,
be
sorry
that
so
pretty
a
young
gentleman
*NL*
should
converse
with
these
women
;
but
if
you
are
resolved
to
do
it
,
I
*NL*
must
beg
you
to
take
another
lodging
;
for
I
do
not
myself
like
to
have
*NL*
such
things
carried
on
under
my
roof
;
but
more
especially
upon
the
*NL*
account
of
my
girls
,
who
have
little
,
heaven
knows
,
besides
their
*NL*
characters
,
to
recommend
them
.
''
Jones
started
and
changed
colour
at
*NL*
the
name
of
Allworthy
.
``
Indeed
,
Mrs
Miller
,
''
answered
he
,
a
little
*NL*
warmly
,
``
I
do
not
take
this
at
all
kind
.
I
will
never
bring
any
*NL*
slander
on
your
house
;
but
I
must
insist
on
seeing
what
company
I
*NL*
please
in
my
own
room
;
and
if
that
gives
you
any
offence
,
I
shall
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
am
able
,
look
for
another
lodging
.
''
--
``
I
am
sorry
we
must
*NL*
part
then
,
sir
,
''
said
she
;
``
but
I
am
convinced
Mr
Allworthy
himself
*NL*
would
never
come
within
my
doors
,
if
he
had
the
least
suspicion
of
my
*NL*
keeping
an
ill
house
.
''
--
``
Very
well
,
madam
,
''
said
Jones
.
--
``
I
hope
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
are
not
angry
;
for
I
would
not
for
the
world
*NL*
offend
any
of
Mr
Allworthy
's
family
.
I
have
not
slept
a
wink
all
night
*NL*
about
this
matter
.
''
--
``
I
am
sorry
I
have
disturbed
your
rest
,
madam
,
''
*NL*
said
Jones
,
``
but
I
beg
you
will
send
Partridge
up
to
me
immediately
;
''
*NL*
which
she
promised
to
do
,
and
then
with
a
very
low
courtesy
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Partridge
arrived
,
Jones
fell
upon
him
in
the
most
*NL*
outrageous
manner
.
``
How
often
,
''
said
he
,
``
am
I
to
suffer
for
your
*NL*
folly
,
or
rather
for
my
own
in
keeping
you
?
is
that
tongue
of
yours
*NL*
resolved
upon
my
destruction
?
''
``
What
have
I
done
,
sir
?
''
answered
*NL*
affrighted
Partridge
.
``
Who
was
it
gave
you
authority
to
mention
the
*NL*
story
of
the
robbery
,
or
that
the
man
you
saw
here
was
the
person
?
''
*NL*
``
I
,
sir
?
''
cries
Partridge
.
``
Now
do
n't
be
guilty
of
a
falsehood
in
*NL*
denying
it
,
''
said
Jones
.
``
If
I
did
mention
such
a
matter
,
''
answers
*NL*
Partridge
,
``
I
am
sure
I
thought
no
harm
;
for
I
should
not
have
opened
*NL*
my
lips
,
if
it
had
not
been
to
his
own
friends
and
relations
,
who
,
I
*NL*
imagined
,
would
have
let
it
go
no
farther
.
''
``
But
I
have
a
much
heavier
*NL*
charge
against
you
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
than
this
.
How
durst
you
,
after
all
*NL*
the
precautions
I
gave
you
,
mention
the
name
of
Mr
Allworthy
in
this
*NL*
house
?
''
Partridge
denied
that
he
ever
had
,
with
many
oaths
.
``
How
*NL*
else
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
should
Mrs
Miller
be
acquainted
that
there
was
any
*NL*
connexion
between
him
and
me
?
And
it
is
but
this
moment
she
told
me
*NL*
she
respected
me
on
his
account
.
''
``
O
Lord
,
sir
,
''
said
Partridge
,
``
I
*NL*
desire
only
to
be
heard
out
;
and
to
be
sure
,
never
was
anything
so
*NL*
unfortunate
:
hear
me
but
out
,
and
you
will
own
how
wrongfully
you
have
*NL*
accused
me
.
When
Mrs
Honour
came
downstairs
last
night
she
met
me
in
*NL*
the
entry
,
and
asked
me
when
my
master
had
heard
from
Mr
Allworthy
;
*NL*
and
to
be
sure
Mrs
Miller
heard
the
very
words
;
and
the
moment
Madam
*NL*
Honour
was
gone
,
she
called
me
into
the
parlour
to
her
.
`
Mr
*NL*
Partridge
,
'
says
she
,
`
what
Mr
Allworthy
is
it
that
the
gentlewoman
*NL*
mentioned
?
is
it
the
great
Mr
Allworthy
of
Somersetshire
?
'
`
Upon
my
*NL*
word
,
madam
,
'
says
I
,
`
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
'
`
Sure
,
'
says
*NL*
she
,
`
your
master
is
not
the
Mr
Jones
I
have
heard
Mr
Allworthy
talk
*NL*
of
?
'
`
Upon
my
word
,
madam
,
'
says
I
,
`
I
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
'
*NL*
`
Then
,
'
says
she
,
turning
to
her
daughter
Nancy
,
says
she
,
`
as
sure
as
*NL*
tenpence
this
is
the
very
young
gentleman
,
and
he
agrees
exactly
with
*NL*
the
squire
's
description
.
'
The
Lord
above
knows
who
it
was
told
her
:
*NL*
for
I
am
the
arrantest
villain
that
ever
walked
upon
two
legs
if
ever
*NL*
it
came
out
of
my
mouth
.
I
promise
you
,
sir
,
I
can
keep
a
secret
when
*NL*
I
am
desired
.
Nay
,
sir
,
so
far
was
I
from
telling
her
anything
about
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
,
that
I
told
her
the
very
direct
contrary
;
for
,
though
I
*NL*
did
not
contradict
it
at
that
moment
,
yet
,
as
second
thoughts
,
they
*NL*
say
,
are
best
,
so
when
I
came
to
consider
that
somebody
must
have
*NL*
informed
her
,
thinks
I
to
myself
,
I
will
put
an
end
to
the
story
;
and
*NL*
so
I
went
back
again
into
the
parlour
some
time
afterwards
,
and
says
*NL*
I
,
upon
my
word
,
says
I
,
whoever
,
says
I
,
told
you
that
this
gentleman
*NL*
was
Mr
Jones
;
that
is
,
says
I
,
that
this
Mr
Jones
was
that
Mr
Jones
,
*NL*
told
you
a
confounded
lie
:
and
I
beg
,
says
I
,
you
will
never
mention
*NL*
any
such
matter
,
says
I
;
for
my
master
,
says
I
,
will
think
I
must
have
*NL*
told
you
so
;
and
I
defy
anybody
in
the
house
ever
to
say
I
mentioned
*NL*
any
such
word
.
To
be
certain
,
sir
,
it
is
a
wonderful
thing
,
and
I
have
*NL*
been
thinking
with
myself
ever
since
,
how
it
was
she
came
to
know
it
;
*NL*
not
but
I
saw
an
old
woman
here
t
`
other
day
a
begging
at
the
door
,
who
*NL*
looked
as
like
her
we
saw
in
Warwickshire
,
that
caused
all
that
*NL*
mischief
to
us
.
To
be
sure
it
is
never
good
to
pass
by
an
old
woman
*NL*
without
giving
her
something
,
especially
if
she
looks
at
you
;
for
all
*NL*
the
world
shall
never
persuade
me
but
that
they
have
a
great
power
to
*NL*
do
mischief
,
and
to
be
sure
I
shall
never
see
an
old
woman
again
,
but
*NL*
I
shall
think
to
myself

*NL*
The
simplicity
of
Partridge
set
Jones
a
laughing
,
and
put
a
final
end
*NL*
to
his
anger
,
which
had
indeed
seldom
any
long
duration
in
his
mind
;
*NL*
and
,
instead
of
commenting
on
his
defence
,
he
told
him
he
intended
*NL*
presently
to
leave
those
lodgings
,
and
ordered
him
to
go
and
endeavour
*NL*
to
get
him
others
.

Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
we
hope
will
be
very
attentively
perused
by
young
people
of
both
*NL*
sexes
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
had
no
sooner
left
Mr
Jones
than
Mr
Nightingale
,
with
whom
*NL*
he
had
now
contracted
a
great
intimacy
,
came
to
him
,
and
,
after
a
*NL*
short
salutation
,
said
,
``
So
,
Tom
,
I
hear
you
had
company
very
late
*NL*
last
night
.
Upon
my
soul
you
are
a
happy
fellow
,
who
have
not
been
in
*NL*
town
above
a
fortnight
,
and
can
keep
chairs
waiting
at
your
door
till
*NL*
two
in
the
morning
.
''
He
then
ran
on
with
much
commonplace
raillery
of
*NL*
the
same
kind
,
till
Jones
at
last
interrupted
him
,
saying
,
``
I
suppose
*NL*
you
have
received
all
this
information
from
Mrs
Miller
,
who
hath
been
*NL*
up
here
a
little
while
ago
to
give
me
warning
.
The
good
woman
is
*NL*
afraid
,
it
seems
,
of
the
reputation
of
her
daughters
.
''
``
Oh
!
she
is
*NL*
wonderfully
nice
,
''
says
Nightingale
,
``
upon
that
account
;
if
you
*NL*
remember
,
she
would
not
let
Nancy
go
with
us
to
the
masquerade
.
''
``
Nay
,
*NL*
upon
my
honour
,
I
think
she
's
in
the
right
of
it
,
''
says
Jones
:
*NL*
``
however
,
I
have
taken
her
at
her
word
,
and
have
sent
Partridge
to
*NL*
look
for
another
lodging
.
''
``
If
you
will
,
''
says
Nightingale
,
``
we
may
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
be
again
together
;
for
,
to
tell
you
a
secret
,
which
I
desire
*NL*
you
wo
n't
mention
in
the
family
,
I
intend
to
quit
the
house
to-day
.
''
*NL*
``
What
,
hath
Mrs
Miller
given
you
warning
too
,
my
friend
?
''
cries
Jones
.
*NL*
``
No
,
''
answered
the
other
;
``
but
the
rooms
are
not
convenient
enough
.
*NL*
Besides
,
I
am
grown
weary
of
this
part
of
the
town
.
I
want
to
be
*NL*
nearer
the
places
of
diversion
;
so
I
am
going
to
Pall-mall
.
''
``
And
do
*NL*
you
intend
to
make
a
secret
of
your
going
away
?
''
said
Jones
.
``
I
*NL*
promise
you
,
''
answered
Nightingale
,
``
I
do
n't
intend
to
bilk
my
*NL*
lodgings
;
but
I
have
a
private
reason
for
not
taking
a
formal
leave
.
''
*NL*
``
Not
so
private
,
''
answered
Jones
;
``
I
promise
you
,
I
have
seen
it
ever
*NL*
since
the
second
day
of
my
coming
to
the
house
.
Here
will
be
some
wet
*NL*
eyes
on
your
departure
.
Poor
Nancy
,
I
pity
her
,
faith
!
Indeed
,
Jack
,
*NL*
you
have
played
the
fool
with
that
girl
.
You
have
given
her
a
longing
,
*NL*
which
I
am
afraid
nothing
will
ever
cure
her
of
.
''
Nightingale
*NL*
answered
,
``
What
the
devil
would
you
have
me
do
?
would
you
have
me
*NL*
marry
her
to
cure
her
?
''
``
No
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
I
would
not
have
had
*NL*
you
make
love
to
her
,
as
you
have
often
done
in
my
presence
.
I
have
*NL*
been
astonished
at
the
blindness
of
her
mother
in
never
seeing
it
.
''
*NL*
``
Pugh
,
see
it
!
''
cries
Nightingale
.
``
What
,
the
devil
should
she
see
?
''
*NL*
``
Why
,
see
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
that
you
have
made
her
daughter
distractedly
*NL*
in
love
with
you
.
The
poor
girl
can
not
conceal
it
a
moment
;
her
eyes
*NL*
are
never
off
from
you
,
and
she
always
colours
every
time
you
come
*NL*
into
the
room
.
Indeed
,
I
pity
her
heartily
;
for
she
seems
to
be
one
of
*NL*
the
best-natured
and
honestest
of
human
creatures
.
''
``
And
so
,
''
answered
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
according
to
your
doctrine
,
one
must
not
amuse
oneself
*NL*
by
any
common
gallantries
with
women
,
for
fear
they
should
fall
in
*NL*
love
with
us
.
''
``
Indeed
,
Jack
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
you
wilfully
misunderstand
*NL*
me
;
I
do
not
fancy
women
are
so
apt
to
fall
in
love
;
but
you
have
gone
*NL*
far
beyond
common
gallantries
.
''
``
What
,
do
you
suppose
,
''
says
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
that
we
have
been
a-bed
together
?
''
``
No
,
upon
my
honour
,
''
*NL*
answered
Jones
,
very
seriously
,
``
I
do
not
suppose
so
ill
of
you
;
nay
,
*NL*
I
will
go
farther
,
I
do
not
imagine
you
have
laid
a
regular
*NL*
premeditated
scheme
for
the
destruction
of
the
quiet
of
a
poor
little
*NL*
creature
,
or
have
even
foreseen
the
consequence
:
for
I
am
sure
thou
*NL*
art
a
very
good-natured
fellow
;
and
such
a
one
can
never
be
guilty
of
*NL*
a
cruelty
of
that
kind
;
but
at
the
same
time
you
have
pleased
your
own
*NL*
vanity
,
without
considering
that
this
poor
girl
was
made
a
sacrifice
*NL*
to
it
;
and
while
you
have
had
no
design
but
of
amusing
an
idle
hour
,
*NL*
you
have
actually
given
her
reason
to
flatter
herself
that
you
had
the
*NL*
most
serious
designs
in
her
favour
.
Prithee
,
Jack
,
answer
me
honestly
;
*NL*
to
what
have
tended
all
those
elegant
and
luscious
descriptions
of
*NL*
happiness
arising
from
violent
and
mutual
fondness
?
all
those
warm
*NL*
professions
of
tenderness
,
and
generous
disinterested
love
?
Did
you
*NL*
imagine
she
would
not
apply
them
?
or
,
speak
ingenuously
,
did
not
you
*NL*
intend
she
should
?
''
``
Upon
my
soul
,
Tom
,
''
cries
Nightingale
,
``
I
did
not
*NL*
think
this
was
in
thee
.
Thou
wilt
make
an
admirable
parson
.
So
I

suppose
you
would
not
go
to
bed
to
Nancy
now
,
if
she
would
let
you
?

*NL*
``
No

Jones
,
``
may
I
be
d

I
would

``
Tom

Tom

answered
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
last
night
;
remember
last
night
--
*NL*
*NL*
When
every
eye
was
closed
,

the
pale
moon

And
silent
stars
,
shone
conscious
of
the
theft

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lookee

Mr
Nightingale

said
Jones
,
``
I
am
no
canting
hypocrite

I
pretend
to
the
gift

chastity

more
than

neighbours

I
have
*NL*
been
guilty
with
women
,
I
own
it
;
but
am
not
conscious
that
I
have
*NL*
ever
injured
any
.
--
Nor
would
I
,
to
procure
pleasure
to
myself
,
be
*NL*
knowingly
the
cause
of
misery
to
any
human
being

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

well

Nightingale
,
``
I
believe
you
,

I
am
convinced
you
*NL*
acquit
me
of
any
such
thing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
from
my
heart
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
of
having
debauched
the
girl
,
*NL*
but
not
from
having
gained
her
affections
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
have
,
''
said
Nightingale
,
``
I
am
sorry
for
it
;
but
time
and
*NL*
absence
will
soon
wear
off
such
impressions
.
It
is
a
receipt
I
must
*NL*
take
myself
;
for
,
to
confess
the
truth
to
you
--
I
never
liked
any
girl
*NL*
half
so
much
in
my
whole
life
;
but
I
must
let
you
into
the
whole
*NL*
secret
,
Tom
.
My
father
hath
provided
a
match
for
me
with
a
woman
I
*NL*
never
saw
;
and
she
is
now
coming
to
town
,
in
order
for
me
to
make
my
*NL*
addresses
to
her
.

*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
Jones
burst
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
;
when
*NL*
Nightingale
cried
--
``
Nay
,
prithee
,
do
n't
turn
me
into
ridicule

The
*NL*

me

half
mad

my
poor

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heartily
wish
you
had

cries
Jones
;
``
for
,
if
this
be
the
case

I
*NL*
sincerely
pity
you
both

but
surely
you
do
n't
intend
to
go
away
*NL*
without
taking
your
leave
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not

answered
Nightingale
,
``
undergo
the
pain
of
taking

leave

for
ten
thousand
pounds
;
besides
,
I
am
convinced

instead
of
*NL*
answering
any
good
purpose

it
would
only
serve
to
inflame
my
poor
*NL*
Nancy
the
more
.
I
beg
,
therefore
,
you
would
not
mention
a
word
of
it
*NL*
to-day
,
and
in
the
evening
,
or
to-morrow
morning
,
I
intend
to
depart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
promised
he
would
not
;
and
said
,
upon
reflection
,
he
thought
,
as
*NL*
he
had
determined
and
was
obliged
to
leave
her
,
he
took
the
most
*NL*
prudent
method
.
He
then
told
Nightingale
he
should
be
very
glad
to
*NL*
lodge
in
the
same
house
with
him
;
and
it
was
accordingly
agreed
*NL*
between
them
,
that
Nightingale
should
procure
him
either
the
ground
*NL*
floor
,
or
the
two
pair
of
stairs
;
for
the
young
gentleman
himself
was
*NL*
to
occupy
that
which
was
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Nightingale
,
of
whom
we
shall
be
presently
obliged
to
say
a
*NL*
little
more
,
was
in
the
ordinary
transactions
of
life
a
man
of
strict
*NL*
honour
,
and
,
what
is
more
rare
among
young
gentlemen
of
the
town
,
one
*NL*
of
strict
honesty
too
;
yet
in
affairs
of
love
he
was
somewhat
loose
in
*NL*
his
morals
;
not
that
he
was
even
here
as
void
of
principle
as
*NL*
gentlemen
sometimes
are
,
and
oftener
affect
to
be
;
but
it
is
certain
*NL*
he
had
been
guilty
of
some
indefensible
treachery
to
women
,
and
had
,
*NL*
in
a
certain
mystery
,
called
making
love
,
practised
many
deceits
,
*NL*
which
,
if
he
had
used
in
trade
,
he
would
have
been
counted
the
*NL*
greatest
villain
upon
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
the
world
,
I
know
not
well
for
what
reason
,
agree
to
see
this
*NL*
treachery
in
a
better
light
,
he
was
so
far
from
being
ashamed
of
his
*NL*
iniquities
of
this
kind
,
that
he
gloried
in
them
,
and
would
often
*NL*
boast
of
his
skill
in
gaining
of
women
,
and
his
triumphs
over
their
*NL*
hearts
,
for
which
he
had
before
this
time
received
some
rebukes
from
*NL*
Jones
,
who
always
exprest
great
bitterness
against
any
misbehaviour
to
*NL*
the
fair
part
of
the
species
,
who
,
if
considered
,
he
said
,
as
they
*NL*
ought
to
be
,
in
the
light
of
the
dearest
friends
,
were
to
be
*NL*
cultivated
,
honoured
,
and
caressed
with
the
utmost
love
and
*NL*
tenderness
;
but
,
if
regarded
as
enemies
,
were
a
conquest
of
which
a
*NL*

ought
rather
to
be
ashamed
than
to
value
himself
upon
it

A
short
account
of
the
history
of
Mrs
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
this
day
eat
a
pretty
good
dinner
for
a
sick
man
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
the
larger
half
of
a
shoulder
of
mutton
.
In
the
afternoon
he
*NL*
received
an
invitation
from
Mrs
Miller
to
drink
tea
;
for
that
good
*NL*
woman
,
having
learnt
,
either
by
means
of
Partridge
,
or
by
some
other
*NL*
means
natural
or
supernatural
,
that
he
had
a
connexion
with
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
could
not
endure
the
thoughts
of
parting
with
him
in
an
*NL*
angry
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
accepted
the
invitation
;
and
no
sooner
was
the
tea-kettle
*NL*
removed
,
and
the
girls
sent
out
of
the
room
,
than
the
widow
,
without
*NL*
much
preface
,
began
as
follows
:
``
Well
,
there
are
very
surprizing
*NL*
things
happen
in
this
world
;
but
certainly
it
is
a
wonderful
business
*NL*
that
I
should
have
a
relation
of
Mr
Allworthy
in
my
house
,
and
never
*NL*
know
anything
of
the
matter
.
Alas
!
sir
,
you
little
imagine
what
a
*NL*
friend
that
best
of
gentlemen
hath
been
to
me
and
mine
.
Yes
,
sir
,
I
am
*NL*
not
ashamed
to
own
it
;
it
is
owing
to
his
goodness
that
I
did
not
long
*NL*
since
perish
for
want
,
and
leave
my
poor
little
wretches
,
two
*NL*
destitute
,
helpless
,
friendless
orphans
,
to
the
care
,
or
rather
to
the
*NL*
cruelty
,
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
know
,
sir
,
though
I
am
now
reduced
to
get
my
living
by
*NL*
letting
lodgings
,
I
was
born
and
bred
a
gentlewoman
.
My
father
was
an
*NL*
officer
of
the
army
,
and
died
in
a
considerable
rank
:
but
he
lived
up
*NL*
to
his
pay
;
and
,
as
that
expired
with
him
,
his
family
,
at
his
death
,
*NL*
became
beggars
.
We
were
three
sisters
.
One
of
us
had
the
good
luck
to
*NL*
die
soon
after
of
the
small-pox
;
a
lady
was
so
kind
as
to
take
the
*NL*
second
out
of
charity
,
as
she
said
,
to
wait
upon
her
.
The
mother
of
*NL*
this
lady
had
been
a
servant
to
my
grand-mother
;
and
,
having
inherited
*NL*
a
vast
fortune
from
her
father
,
which
he
had
got
by
pawnbroking
,
was
*NL*
married
to
a
gentleman
of
great
estate
and
fashion
.
She
used
my
sister
*NL*
so
barbarously
,
often
upbraiding
her
with
her
birth
and
poverty
,
*NL*
calling
her
in
derision
a
gentlewoman
,
that
I
believe
she
at
length
*NL*
broke
the
heart
of
the
poor
girl
.
In
short
,
she
likewise
died
within
a
*NL*
twelvemonth
after
my
father
.
Fortune
thought
proper
to
provide
better
*NL*
for
me
,
and
within
a
month
from
his
decease
I
was
married
to
a
*NL*
clergyman
,
who
had
been
my
lover
a
long
time
before
,
and
who
had
been
*NL*
very
ill
used
by
my
father
on
that
account
:
for
though
my
poor
father
*NL*
could
not
give
any
of
us
a
shilling
,
yet
he
bred
us
up
as
delicately
,
*NL*
considered
us
,
and
would
have
had
us
consider
ourselves
,
as
highly
as
*NL*
if
we
had
been
the
richest
heiresses
.
But
my
dear
husband
forgot
all
*NL*
this
usage
,
and
the
moment
we
were
become
fatherless
he
immediately
*NL*
renewed
his
addresses
to
me
so
warmly
,
that
I
,
who
always
liked
,
and
*NL*
now
more
than
ever
esteemed
him
,
soon
complied
.
Five
years
did
I
live
*NL*
in
a
state
of
perfect
happiness
with
that
best
of
men
,
till
at
*NL*
last
--
Oh
!
cruel
!
cruel
fortune
,
that
ever
separated
us
,
that
deprived
*NL*
me
of
the
kindest
of
husbands
and
my
poor
girls
of
the
tenderest
*NL*
parent
.
--
O
my
poor
girls
!
you
never
knew
the
blessing
which
ye
*NL*
lost
.
--
I
am
ashamed
,
Mr
Jones
,
of
this
womanish
weakness
;
but
I
shall
*NL*
never
mention
him
without
tears
.
''
``
I
ought
rather
,
madam
,
''
said
Jones
,
*NL*
``
to
be
ashamed
that
I
do
not
accompany
you
.
''
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
continued
*NL*
she
,
``
I
was
now
left
a
second
time
in
a
much
worse
condition
than
*NL*
before
;
besides
the
terrible
affliction
I
was
to
encounter
,
I
had
now
*NL*
two
children
to
provide
for
;

was
,
if
possible
,
more
pennyless
than
*NL*
ever
;

that
great

that
good

that
glorious
man

Mr
Allworthy
,
who
*NL*
had
some
little
acquaintance
with
my
husband
,
accidentally
heard
of
my
*NL*
distress
,
and
immediately
writ
this
letter
to
me

Here

here
it
*NL*
is

I
put
it
into
my
pocket

heartily

good
sense

the
excellent
lessons
you
must
have
learnt
from

will
better
enable
you

I
am
capable

giving

Nor

I
any
doubt
that
you

I

have
heard
to

the
tenderest

will
suffer
any

immoderate

prevent
you

discharging

those
poor
infants

alone
stand

However

as
you
must
be
supposed
at

to
be
incapable

much
worldly
consideration

you
will
pardon
my
having
ordered

twenty
guineas

``
This
letter
,
sir
,
I
received
within
a
fortnight
after
the
irreparable
*NL*
loss
I
have
mentioned
;
and
within
a
fortnight
afterwards
,
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
--
the
blessed
Mr
Allworthy
,
came
to
pay
me
a
visit
,
when
he
*NL*
placed
me
in
the
house
where
you
now
see
me
,
gave
me
a
large
sum
of
*NL*
money
to
furnish
it
,
and
settled
an
annuity
of
L50
a-year
upon
me
,
*NL*
which
I
have
constantly
received
ever
since
.
Judge
,
then
,
Mr
Jones
,
in
*NL*
what
regard
I
must
hold
a
benefactor
,
to
whom
I
owe
the
preservation
*NL*
of
my
life
,
and
of
those
dear
children
,
for
whose
sake
alone
my
life
*NL*
is
valuable
.
Do
not
,
therefore
,
think
me
impertinent
,
Mr
Jones
-LRB-
since
*NL*
I
must
esteem
one
for
whom
I
know
Mr
Allworthy
hath
so
much
value
-RRB-
,
if
*NL*
I
beg
you
not
to
converse
with
these
wicked
women
.
You
are
a
young
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
do
not
know
half
their
artful
wiles
.
Do
not
be
angry
*NL*
with
me
,
sir
,
for
what
I
said
upon
account
of
my
house
;
you
must
be
*NL*
sensible
it
would
be
the
ruin
of
my
poor
dear
girls
.
Besides
,
sir
,
you
*NL*
can
not
but
be
acquainted
that
Mr
Allworthy
himself
would
never
forgive
*NL*
my
conniving
at
such
matters
,
and
particularly
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
madam

''
said
Jones
,
``
you
need
make
no
farther
apology
;
*NL*
nor
do
I
in
the
least
take
anything
ill
you
have
said
;
but
give
me
*NL*
leave
,
as
no
one
can
have
more
value
than
myself
for
Mr
Allworthy
,
to
*NL*
deliver
you
from
one
mistake
,
which
,
perhaps
,
would
not
be
altogether
*NL*
for
his
honour
;
I
do
assure
you
,
I
am
no
relation
of
his
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
sir
,
''
answered
she
,
``
I
know
you
are
not
,
I
know
very
well
who
*NL*
you
are
;
for
Mr
Allworthy
hath
told
me
all
;
but
I
do
assure
you
,
had
*NL*
you
been
twenty
times
his
son
,
he
could
not
have
expressed
more
regard
*NL*
for
you
than
he
hath
often
expressed
in
my
presence
.
You
need
not
be
*NL*
ashamed
,
sir
,
of
what
you
are
;
I
promise
you
no
good
person
will
*NL*
esteem
you
the
less
on
that
account
.
No
,
Mr
Jones
,
the
words
*NL*
`
dishonourable
birth
'
are
nonsense
,
as
my
dear
,
dear
husband
used
to
*NL*
say
,
unless
the
word
`
dishonourable
'
be
applied
to
the
parents
;
for
*NL*
the
children
can
derive
no
real
dishonour
from
an
act
of
which
they
*NL*
are
intirely
innocent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Jones
heaved
a
deep
sigh
,
and
then
said
,
``
Since
I
perceive
,
*NL*
madam
,
you
really
do
know
me
,
and
Mr
Allworthy
hath
thought
proper
to
*NL*
mention
my
name
to
you
;
and
since
you
have
been
so
explicit
with
me
as
*NL*
to
your
own
affairs
,
I
will
acquaint
you
with
some
more
circumstances
*NL*
concerning
myself
.
''
And
these
Mrs
Miller
having
expressed
great
desire
*NL*
and
curiosity
to
hear
,
he
began
and
related
to
her
his
whole
history
,
*NL*
without
once
mentioning
the
name
of
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
kind
of
sympathy
in
honest
minds
,
by
means
of
which
they
*NL*
give
an
easy
credit
to
each
other
.
Mrs
Miller
believed
all
which
Jones
*NL*
told
her
to
be
true
,
and
exprest
much
pity
and
concern
for
him
.
She
*NL*
was
beginning
to
comment
on
the
story
,
but
Jones
interrupted
her
;
for
,
*NL*
as
the
hour
of
assignation
now
drew
nigh
,
he
began
to
stipulate
for
a
*NL*
second
interview
with
the
lady
that
evening
,
which
he
promised
should
*NL*
be
the
last
at
her
house
;
swearing
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
she
was
one
*NL*
of
great
distinction
,
and
that
nothing
but
what
was
intirely
innocent
*NL*
was
to
pass
between
them
;
and
I
do
firmly
believe
he
intended
to
keep
*NL*
his
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
was
at
length
prevailed
on
,
and
Jones
departed
to
his
*NL*
chamber
,
where
he
sat
alone
till
twelve
o'clock
,
but
no
Lady
Bellaston
*NL*
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
said
that
this
lady
had
a
great
affection
for
Jones
,
and
as
*NL*
it
must
have
appeared
that
she
really
had
so
,
the
reader
may
perhaps
*NL*
wonder
at
the
first
failure
of
her
appointment
,
as
she
apprehended
him
*NL*
to
be
confined
by
sickness
,
a
season
when
friendship
seems
most
to
*NL*
require
such
visits
.
This
behaviour
,
therefore
,
in
the
lady
,
may
,
by
*NL*
some
,
be
condemned
as
unnatural
;
but
that
is
not
our
fault
;
for
our
*NL*
business
is
only
to
record
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
a
scene
which
we
doubt
not
will
affect
all
our
readers
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
closed
not
his
eyes
during
all
the
former
part
of
the
night
;
*NL*
not
owing
to
any
uneasiness
which
he
conceived
at
being
disappointed
*NL*
by
Lady
Bellaston
;
nor
was
Sophia
herself
,
though
most
of
his
waking
*NL*
hours
were
justly
to
be
charged
to
her
account
,
the
present
cause
of
*NL*
dispelling
his
slumbers
.
In
fact
,
poor
Jones
was
one
of
the
*NL*
best-natured
fellows
alive
,
and
had
all
that
weakness
which
is
called
*NL*
compassion
,
and
which
distinguishes
this
imperfect
character
from
that
*NL*
noble
firmness
of
mind
,
which
rolls
a
man
,
as
it
were
,
within
himself
,
*NL*
and
like
a
polished
bowl
,
enables
him
to
run
through
the
world
without
*NL*
being
once
stopped
by
the
calamities
which
happen
to
others
.
He
could
*NL*
not
help
,
therefore
,
compassionating
the
situation
of
poor
Nancy
,
*NL*
whose
love
for
Mr
Nightingale
seemed
to
him
so
apparent
,
that
he
was
*NL*
astonished
at
the
blindness
of
her
mother
,
who
had
more
than
once
,
the
*NL*
preceding
evening
,
remarked
to
him
the
great
change
in
the
temper
of
*NL*
her
daughter
,
``
who
from
being
,
''
she
said
,
``
one
of
the
liveliest
,
*NL*
merriest
girls
in
the
world
,
was
,
on
a
sudden
,
become
all
gloom
and
*NL*
melancholy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sleep
,
however
,
at
length
got
the
better
of
all
resistance
;
and
now
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
already
been
a
deity
,
as
the
antients
imagined
,
and
an
*NL*
offended
one
too
,
he
seemed
to
enjoy
his
dear-bought
conquest
.
--
To
*NL*
speak
simply
,
and
without
any
metaphor
,
Mr
Jones
slept
till
eleven
the
*NL*
next
morning
,
and
would
,
perhaps
,
have
continued
in
the
same
quiet
*NL*
situation
much
longer
,
had
not
a
violent
uproar
awakened
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
was
now
summoned
,
who
,
being
asked
what
was
the
matter
,
*NL*
answered
,
``
That
there
was
a
dreadful
hurricane
below-stairs
;
that
*NL*
Miss
Nancy
was
in
fits
;
and
that
the
other
sister
,
and
the
mother
,
*NL*
were
both
crying
and
lamenting
over
her
.
''
Jones
expressed
much
*NL*
concern
at
this
news
;
which
Partridge
endeavoured
to
relieve
,
by
*NL*
saying
,
with
a
smile
,
``
he
fancied
the
young
lady
was
in
no
danger
of
*NL*
death
;
for
that
Susan
''
-LRB-
which
was
the
name
of
the
maid
-RRB-
``
had
given
*NL*
him
to
understand
,
it
was
nothing
more
than
a
common
affair
.
In
*NL*
short
,
''
said
he
,
``
Miss
Nancy
hath
had
a
mind
to
be
as
wise
as
her
*NL*
mother
;
that
's
all
;
she
was
a
little
hungry
,
it
seems
,
and
so
sat
*NL*
down
to
dinner
before
grace
was
said
;
and
so
there
is
a
child
coming
*NL*
for
the
Foundling
Hospital
.
''
--
``
Prithee
,
leave
thy
stupid
jesting
,
''
*NL*
cries
Jones
.
``
Is
the
misery
of
these
poor
wretches
a

of
*NL*
mirth

Go
immediately
to
Mrs
Miller
,
and
tell
her
I
beg
leave
--
Stay
,
*NL*
you
will
make
some
blunder
;
I
will
go
myself
;
for
she
desired
me
to
*NL*
breakfast
with
her

''
He
then
rose
and
dressed
himself
as
fast
as
he
*NL*
could
;
and
while
he
was
dressing
,
Partridge
,
notwithstanding
many
*NL*
severe
rebukes
,
could
not
avoid
throwing
forth
certain
pieces
of
*NL*
brutality
,
commonly
called
jests
,
on
this
occasion
.
Jones
was
no
*NL*
sooner
dressed
than
he
walked
downstairs
,
and
knocking
at
the
door
,
*NL*
was
presently
admitted
by
the
maid
,
into
the
outward
parlour
,
which
*NL*
was
as
empty
of
company
as
it
was
of
any
apparatus
for
eating
.
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
was
in
the
inner
room
with
her
daughter
,
whence
the
maid
*NL*
presently
brought
a
message
to
Mr
Jones
,
``
That
her
mistress
hoped
he
*NL*
would
excuse
the
disappointment
,
but
an
accident
had
happened
,
which
*NL*
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
have
the
pleasure
of
his
company
at
*NL*
breakfast
that
day
;
and
begged
his
pardon
for
not
sending
him
up
*NL*
notice
sooner
.
''
Jones
desired
,
``
She
would
give
herself
no
trouble
*NL*
about
anything
so
trifling
as
his
disappointment
;
that
he
was
*NL*
heartily
sorry
for
the
occasion
;
and
that
if
he
could
be
of
any
*NL*
service
to
her
,
she
might
command
him
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
had
scarce
spoke
these
words
,
when
Mrs
Miller
,
who
heard
them
all
,
*NL*
suddenly
threw
open
the
door
,
and
coming
out
to
him
,
in
a
flood
of
*NL*
tears
,
said
,
``
O
Mr
Jones
!
you
are
certainly
one
of
the
best
young
men
*NL*
alive

I
give
you
a
thousand
thanks
for
your
kind
offer
of
your
*NL*
service
;
but
,
alas
!
sir
,
it
is
out
of
your
power
to
preserve
my
poor
*NL*
girl
.

O
my
child

my

she
is
undone

she
is
ruined
for
ever

*NL*
``
I

said
Jones
,
``
no

--
``
O
Mr
Jones

said
she
,
*NL*
``
that
villain

yesterday
left

tell

indeed

it
is
impossible
,
after
what
hath
happened

to
keep
it

That

Mr
Jones
,
my
girl
is
with
child
by
him

in
that
condition

hath
deserted
her

Here

is
his
*NL*
cruel
letter

lives

The
letter
was
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
DEAR
NANCY
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
found
it
impossible
to
mention
to
you
what
,
I
am
afraid
,
will
*NL*
be
no
less
shocking
to
you
,
than
it
is
to
me
,
I
have
taken
this
*NL*
method
to
inform
you
,
that
my
father
insists
upon
my
immediately
*NL*
paying
my
addresses
to
a
young
lady
of
fortune
,
whom
he
hath
*NL*
provided
for
my
--
I
need
not
write
the
detested
word
.
Your
own
good
*NL*
understanding
will
make
you
sensible
,
how
entirely
I
am
obliged
to
*NL*
an
obedience
,
by
which
I
shall
be
for
ever
excluded
from
your
dear
*NL*
arms
.
The
fondness
of
your
mother
may
encourage
you
to
trust
her
*NL*
with
the
unhappy
consequence
of
our
love
,
which
may
be
easily
kept
a
*NL*
secret
from
the
world
,
and
for
which
I
will
take
care
to
provide
,
as
*NL*
I
will
for
you
.
I
wish
you
may
feel
less
on
this
account
than
I
have
*NL*
suffered
;
but
summon
all
your
fortitude
to
your
assistance
,
and
*NL*
forgive
and
forget
the
man
,
whom
nothing
but
the
prospect
of
certain
*NL*
ruin
could
have
forced
to
write
this
letter
.
I
bid
you
forget
me
,
I
*NL*
mean
only
as
a
lover
;
but
the
best
of
friends
you
shall
ever
find
in
*NL*
your
faithful
,
though
unhappy

When
Jones
had
read
this
letter
,
they
both
stood
silent
during
a
*NL*
minute
,
looking
at
each
other
;
at
last
he
began
thus
:
``
I
can
not
*NL*
express
,
madam
,
how
much
I
am
shocked
at
what
I
have
read
;
yet
let
me
*NL*
beg
you
,
in
one
particular
,
to
take
the
writer
's
advice
.
Consider
the
*NL*
reputation
of
your
daughter
.
''
--
``
It
is
gone
,
it
is
lost
,
Mr
Jones
,
''
*NL*
cryed
she
,
``
as
well
as
her
innocence
.
She
received
the
letter
in
a
*NL*
room
full
of
company
,
and
immediately
swooning
away
upon
opening
it
,
*NL*
the
contents
were
known
to
every
one
present
.
But
the
loss
of
her
*NL*
reputation
,
bad
as
it
is
,
is
not
the
worst
;
I
shall
lose
my
child
;
she
*NL*
hath
attempted
twice
to
destroy
herself
already
;
and
though
she
hath
*NL*
been
hitherto
prevented
,
vows
she
will
not
outlive
it
;
nor
could
I
*NL*
myself
outlive
any
accident
of
that
nature
.
--
What
then
will
become
of
*NL*
my
little
Betsy
,
a
helpless
infant
orphan
?
and
the
poor
little
wretch
*NL*
will
,
I
believe
,
break
her
heart
at
the
miseries
with
which
she
sees
*NL*
her
sister
and
myself
distracted
,
while
she
is
ignorant
of
the
cause
.
*NL*
O
't
is
the
most
sensible
,
and
best-natured
little
thing
!
The
*NL*
barbarous
,
cruel
--
hath
destroyed
us
all
.
O
my
poor
children
!
Is
this
*NL*
the
reward
of
all
my
cares
?
Is
this
the
fruit
of
all
my
prospects
?
*NL*
Have
I
so
chearfully
undergone
all
the
labours
and
duties
of
a
mother
?
*NL*
Have
I
been
so
tender
of
their
infancy
,
so
careful
of
their
education
?
*NL*
Have
I
been
toiling
so
many
years
,
denying
myself
even
the
*NL*
conveniences
of
life
,
to
provide
some
little
sustenance
for
them
,
to
*NL*
lose
one
or
both
in
such
a
manner
?
''
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
said
Jones
,
with
*NL*
tears
in
his
eyes
,
``
I
pity
you
from
my
soul
.
''
--
``
O
!
Mr
Jones
,
''
answered
*NL*
she
,
``
even
you
,
though
I
know
the
goodness
of
your
heart
,
can
have
no
*NL*
idea
of
what
I
feel
.
The
best
,
the
kindest
,
the
most
dutiful
of
*NL*
children
!
O
my
poor
Nancy
,
the
darling
of
my
soul
!
the
delight
of
my
*NL*
eyes
!
the
pride
of
my
heart

too
much
,
indeed
,
my
pride
;
for
to
those
*NL*
foolish
,
ambitious
hopes
,
arising
from
her
beauty
,
I
owe
her
ruin
.
*NL*
Alas
!
I
saw
with
pleasure
the
liking
which
this
young
man
had
for
her
.
*NL*
I
thought
it
an
honourable
affection
;
and
flattered
my
foolish
vanity
*NL*
with
the
thoughts
of
seeing
her
married
to
one
so
much
her
superior
.
*NL*
And
a
thousand
times
in
my
presence
,
nay
,
often
in
yours
,
he
hath
*NL*
endeavoured
to
soothe
and
encourage
these
hopes
by
the
most
generous
*NL*
expressions
of
disinterested
love
,
which
he
hath
always
directed
to
my
*NL*
poor
girl
,
and
which
I
,
as
well
as
she
,
believed
to
be
real
.
Could
I
*NL*
have
believed
that
these
were
only
snares
laid
to
betray
the
innocence
*NL*
of
my
child
,
and
for
the
ruin
of
us
all
?
''
--
At
these
words
little
Betsy
*NL*
came
running
into
the
room
,
crying
,
``
Dear
mamma
,
for
heaven
's
sake
*NL*
come
to
my
sister
;
for
she
is
in
another
fit
,
and
my
cousin
ca
n't
hold
*NL*
her
.
''
Mrs
Miller
immediately
obeyed
the
summons
;
but
first
ordered
*NL*
Betsy
to
stay
with
Mr
Jones
,
and
begged
him
to
entertain
her
a
few
*NL*
minutes
,
saying
,
in
the
most
pathetic
voice
,
``
Good
heaven
!
let
me
*NL*
preserve
one
of
my
children
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
in
compliance
with
this
request
,
did
all
he
could
to
comfort
*NL*
the
little
girl
,
though
he
was
,
in
reality
,
himself
very
highly
*NL*
affected
with
Mrs
Miller
's
story
.
He
told
her
``
Her
sister
would
be
*NL*
soon
very
well
again
;
that
by
taking
on
in
that
manner
she
would
not
*NL*
only
make
her
sister
worse
,
but
make
her
mother
ill
too
.
''
``
Indeed
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
would
not
do
anything
to
hurt
them
for
the
world
.
I
*NL*
would
burst
my
heart
rather
than
they
should
see
me
cry
.
--
But
my
poor
*NL*
sister
ca
n't
see
me
cry
.
--
I
am
afraid
she
will
never
be
able
to
see
me
*NL*
cry
any
more
.
Indeed
,
I
ca
n't
part
with
her
;
indeed
,
I
ca
n't
.
--
And
*NL*
then
poor
mamma
too
,
what
will
become
of
her
?
--
She
says
she
will
die
*NL*
too
,
and
leave
me
:
but
I
am
resolved
I
wo
n't
be
left
behind
.
''
``
And
are
*NL*
you
not
afraid
to
die
,
my
little
Betsy
?
''
said
Jones
.
``
Yes
,
''
answered
*NL*
she
,
``
I
was
always
afraid
to
die
;
because
I
must
have
left
my
mamma
,
*NL*
and
my
sister
;
but
I
am
not
afraid
of
going
anywhere
with
those
I
*NL*
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
so
pleased
with
this
answer
,
that
he
eagerly
kissed
the
*NL*
child
;
and
soon
after
Mrs
Miller
returned
,
saying
,
``
She
thanked
heaven
*NL*
Nancy
was
now
come
to
herself
.
And
now
,
Betsy
,
''
says
she
,
``
you
may
go
*NL*
in
,
for
your
sister
is
better
,
and
longs
to
see
you
.
''
She
then
turned
*NL*
to
Jones
,
and
began
to
renew
her
apologies
for
having
disappointed
him
*NL*
of
his
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
madam
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
I
shall
have
a
more
exquisite
repast
*NL*
than
any
you
could
have
provided
for
me
.
This
,
I
assure
you
,
will
be
*NL*
the
case
,
if
I
can
do
any
service
to
this
little
family
of
love
.
But
*NL*
whatever
success
may
attend
my
endeavours
,
I
am
resolved
to
attempt
*NL*
it
.
I
am
very
much
deceived
in
Mr
Nightingale
,
if
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
what
hath
happened
,
he
hath
not
much
goodness
of
heart
at
the
bottom
,
*NL*
as
well
as
a
very
violent
affection
for
your
daughter
.
If
this
be
the
*NL*
case
,
I
think
the
picture
which
I
shall
lay
before
him
will
affect
*NL*
him

Endeavour

to
comfort
yourself

and
Miss
Nancy

as
well
as
*NL*
you
can

I
will
go
instantly

quest
of

I
hope
to
*NL*
bring
you
good
news

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
fell
upon
her
knees
and
invoked
all
the
blessings
of
heaven
*NL*
upon
Mr
Jones
;
to
which
she
afterwards
added
the
most
passionate
*NL*
expressions
of
gratitude
.
He
then
departed
to
find
Mr
Nightingale
,
and
*NL*
the
good
woman
returned
to
comfort
her
daughter
,
who
was
somewhat
*NL*
cheared
at
what
her
mother
told
her
;
and
both
joined
in
resounding
the
*NL*
praises
of
Mr
Jones

Chapter
vii

*NL*
*NL*
The
interview
between
Mr
Jones
and
Mr
Nightingale
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
or
evil
we
confer
on
others
very
often
,
I
believe
,
recoils
on
*NL*
ourselves
.
For
as
men
of
a
benign
disposition
enjoy
their
own
acts
of
*NL*
beneficence
equally
with
those
to
whom
they
are
done
,
so
there
are
*NL*
scarce
any
natures
so
entirely
diabolical
,
as
to
be
capable
of
doing
*NL*
injuries
,
without
paying
themselves
some
pangs
for
the
ruin
which
they
*NL*
bring
on
their
fellow-creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Nightingale
,
at
least
,
was
not
such
a
person
.
On
the
contrary
,
*NL*
Jones
found
him
in
his
new
lodgings
,
sitting
melancholy
by
the
fire
,
*NL*
and
silently
lamenting
the
unhappy
situation
in
which
he
had
placed
*NL*
poor
Nancy
.
He
no
sooner
saw
his
friend
appear
than
he
arose
hastily
*NL*
to
meet
him
;
and
after
much
congratulation
said
,
``
Nothing
could
be
*NL*
more
opportune
than
this
kind
visit
;
for
I
was
never
more
in
the
*NL*
spleen
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
that
I
bring
news
very
unlikely
to
*NL*
relieve
you
:
nay
,
what
I
am
convinced
must
,
of
all
other
,
shock
you
*NL*
the
most
.
However
,
it
is
necessary
you
should
know
it
.
Without
further
*NL*
preface
,
then
,
I
come
to
you
,
Mr
Nightingale
,
from
a
worthy
family
,
*NL*
which
you
have
involved
in
misery
and
ruin
.
''
Mr
Nightingale
changed
*NL*
colour
at
these
words
;
but
Jones
,
without
regarding
it
,
proceeded
,
in
*NL*
the
liveliest
manner
,
to
paint
the
tragical
story
with
which
the
*NL*
reader
was
acquainted
in
the
last
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nightingale
never
once
interrupted
the
narration
,
though
he
discovered
*NL*
violent
emotions
at
many
parts
of
it
.
But
when
it
was
concluded
,
after
*NL*
fetching
a
deep
sigh
,
he
said
,
``
What
you
tell
me
,
my
friend
,
affects
*NL*
me
in
the
tenderest
manner
.
Sure
there
never
was
so
cursed
an
accident
*NL*
as
the
poor
girl
's
betraying
my
letter
.
Her
reputation
might
otherwise
*NL*
have
been
safe
,
and
the
affair
might
have
remained
a
profound
secret
;
*NL*
and
then
the
girl
might
have
gone
off
never
the
worse
;
for
many
such
*NL*
things
happen
in
this
town
:
and
if
the
husband
should
suspect
a
*NL*
little
,
when
it
is
too
late
,
it
will
be
his
wiser
conduct
to
conceal
*NL*
his
suspicion
both
from
his
wife
and
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
my
friend
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
this
could
not
have
been
the
*NL*
case
with
your
poor
Nancy
.
You
have
so
entirely
gained
her
affections
,
*NL*
that
it
is
the
loss
of
you
,
and
not
of
her
reputation
,
which
afflicts
*NL*
her
,
and
will
end
in
the
destruction
of
her
and
her
family
.
''
``
Nay
,
for
*NL*
that
matter
,
I
promise
you
,
''
cries
Nightingale
,
``
she
hath
my
*NL*
affections
so
absolutely
,
that
my
wife
,
whoever
she
is
to
be
,
will
*NL*
have
very
little
share
in
them
.
''
``
And
is
it
possible
then
,
''
said
*NL*
Jones
,
``
you
can
think
of
deserting
her
?
''
``
Why
,
what
can
I
do
?
''
*NL*
answered
the
other
.
``
Ask
Miss
Nancy
,
''
replied
Jones
warmly
.
``
In
the
*NL*
condition
to
which
you
have
reduced
her
,
I
sincerely
think
she
ought
*NL*
to
determine
what
reparation
you
shall
make
her
.
Her
interest
alone
,
*NL*
and
not
yours
,
ought
to
be
your
sole
consideration
.
But
if
you
ask
me
*NL*
what
you
shall
do
,
what
can
you
do
less
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
than
fulfil
*NL*
the
expectations
of
her
family
,
and
her
own
?
Nay
,
I
sincerely
tell
*NL*
you
,
they
were
mine
too
,
ever
since
I
first
saw
you
together
.
You
will
*NL*
pardon
me
if
I
presume
on
the
friendship
you
have
favoured
me
with

*NL*
moved
as
I
am
with
compassion
for
those
poor
creatures

But
your
own
*NL*
heart
will
best
suggest
to
you
,
whether
you
have
never
intended
,
by
*NL*
your
conduct
,
to
persuade
the
mother
,
as
well
as
the
daughter
,
into
an
*NL*
opinion
,
that
you
designed
honourably
:
and
if
so
,
though
there
may
*NL*
have
been
no
direct
promise
of
marriage
in
the
case
,
I
will
leave
to
*NL*
your
own
good
understanding
,
how
far
you
are
bound
to
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
I
must
not
only
confess
what
you
have
hinted
,
''
said
Nightingale
;
*NL*
``
but
I
am
afraid
even
that
very
promise
you
mention
I
have
given
.
''
*NL*
``
And
can
you
,
after
owning
that
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
hesitate
a
moment
?
''
*NL*
``
Consider
,
my
friend
,
''
answered
the
other
;
``
I
know
you
are
a
man
of
*NL*
honour
,
and
would
advise
no
one
to
act
contrary
to
its
rules
;
if
there
*NL*
were
no
other
objection
,
can
I
,
after
this
publication
of
her
*NL*
disgrace
,
think
of
such
an
alliance
with
honour
?
''
``
Undoubtedly
,
''
*NL*
replied
Jones
,
``
and
the
very
best
and
truest
honour
,
which
is
*NL*
goodness
,
requires
it
of
you
.
As
you
mention
a
scruple
of
this
kind
,
*NL*
you
will
give
me
leave
to
examine
it
.
Can
you
with
honour
be
guilty
of
*NL*
having
under
false
pretences
deceived
a
young
woman
and
her
family
,
*NL*
and
of
having
by
these
means
treacherously
robbed
her
of
her
*NL*
innocence
?
Can
you
,
with
honour
,
be
the
knowing
,
the
wilful
occasion
,
*NL*
nay
,
the
artful
contriver
of
the
ruin
of
a
human
being
?
Can
you
,
with
*NL*
honour
,
destroy
the
fame
,
the
peace
,
nay
,
probably
,
both
the
life
and
*NL*
soul
too
,
of
this
creature
?
Can
honour
bear
the
thought
,
that
this
*NL*
creature
is
a
tender
,
helpless

defenceless
,
young
woman
?
A
young
*NL*
woman
,
who
loves
,
who
doats
on
you
,
who
dies
for
you
;
who
hath
placed
*NL*
the
utmost
confidence
in
your
promises
;
and
to
that
confidence
hath
*NL*
sacrificed
everything
which
is
dear
to
her
?
Can
honour
support
such
*NL*
contemplations
as
these
a
moment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Common
sense
,
indeed
,
''
said
Nightingale
,
``
warrants
all
you
say
;
but
*NL*
yet
you
well
know
the
opinion
of
the
world
is
so
contrary
to
it
,
that
,
*NL*
was
I
to
marry
a
whore
,
though
my
own
,
I
should
be
ashamed
of
ever
*NL*
showing
my
face
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fie
upon
it
,
Mr
Nightingale
!
''
said
Jones
,
``
do
not
call
her
by
so
*NL*
ungenerous
a
name
:
when
you
promised
to
marry
her
she
became
your
*NL*
wife
;
and
she
hath
sinned
more
against
prudence
than
virtue
.
And
what
*NL*
is
this
world
which
you
would
be
ashamed
to
face
but
the
vile
,
the
*NL*
foolish
,
and
the
profligate
?
Forgive
me
if
I
say
such
a
shame
must
*NL*
proceed
from
false
modesty
,
which
always
attends
false
honour
as
its
*NL*
shadow
.
--
But
I
am
well
assured
there
is
not
a
man
of
real
sense
and
*NL*
goodness
in
the
world
who
would
not
honour
and
applaud
the
action
.
*NL*
But
,
admit
no
other
would
,
would
not
your
own
heart
,
my
friend
,
*NL*
applaud
it
?
And
do
not
the
warm
,
rapturous
sensations
,
which
we
feel
*NL*
from
the
consciousness
of
an
honest
,
noble
,
generous
,
benevolent
*NL*
action
,
convey
more
delight
to
the
mind
than
the
undeserved
praise
of
*NL*
millions
?
Set
the
alternative
fairly
before
your
eyes
.
On
the
one
*NL*
side
,
see
this
poor
,
unhappy
,
tender
,
believing
girl
,
in
the
arms
of
*NL*
her
wretched
mother
,
breathing
her
last
.
Hear
her
breaking
heart
in
*NL*
agonies
,
sighing
out
your
name
;
and
lamenting
,
rather
than
accusing
,
*NL*
the
cruelty
which
weighs
her
down
to
destruction
.
Paint
to
your
*NL*
imagination
the
circumstances
of
her
fond
despairing
parent
,
driven
to
*NL*
madness
,
or
,
perhaps
,
to
death
,
by
the
loss
of
her
lovely
daughter
.
*NL*
View
the
poor
,
helpless
,
orphan
infant
;
and
when
your
mind
hath
dwelt
*NL*
a
moment
only
on
such
ideas
,
consider
yourself
as
the
cause
of
all
the
*NL*
ruin
of
this
poor
,
little
,
worthy
,
defenceless
family
.
On
the
other
*NL*
side
,
consider
yourself
as
relieving
them
from
their
temporary
*NL*
sufferings
.
Think
with
what
joy
,
with
what
transports
that
lovely
*NL*
creature
will
fly
to
your
arms
.
See
her
blood
returning
to
her
pale
*NL*
cheeks
,
her
fire
to
her
languid
eyes
,
and
raptures
to
her
tortured
*NL*
breast
.
Consider
the
exultations
of
her
mother
,
the
happiness
of
all
.
*NL*
Think
of
this
little
family
made
by
one
act
of
yours
completely
happy
.
*NL*
Think
of
this
alternative
,
and
sure
I
am
mistaken
in
my
friend
if
it
*NL*
requires
any
long
deliberation
whether
he
will
sink
these
wretches
*NL*
down
for
ever
,
or
,
by
one
generous
,
noble
resolution
,
raise
them
all
*NL*
from
the
brink
of
misery
and
despair
to
the
highest
pitch
of
human
*NL*
happiness
.
Add
to
this
but
one
consideration
more
;
the
consideration
*NL*
that
it
is
your
duty
so
to
do
--
That
the
misery
from
which
you
will
*NL*
relieve
these
poor
people
is
the
misery
which
you
yourself
have
*NL*
wilfully
brought
upon
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
my
dear
friend
!
''
cries
Nightingale
,
``
I
wanted
not
your
eloquence
*NL*
to
rouse
me

I
pity
poor
Nancy

my
soul

willingly
give
*NL*
anything
in
my
power

no
familiarities
had
ever
passed

*NL*
Nay

believe

I
had
many
struggles
with
my
passion

I

prevail
with
myself
to
write
that
cruel
letter

hath
caused
all

the
misery
in

unhappy

If
I
had
no

I
would
marry

to-morrow
morning

you
will
easily
imagine
how
impossible
it
would
be
to
prevail
on

my
father
to
consent
to
such
a
match
;
besides

he
hath
provided

another
for

``
As
eagerly
as
I
would
pursue

answered
Nightingale
:

I
never

could
you

within

twelve
hours
for

I
am
convinced
she
would

not

Passion
leads
me
only
to
her
;
and
,
if
I
had
*NL*
any
foolish
scruples

honour

you
have
fully
satisfied
them
:
could
*NL*
my
father
be
induced
to
comply
with
my
desires

nothing
would
be
*NL*
wanting
to
compleat
my
own
happiness
or
that
of
my
Nancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
am
resolved
to
undertake
it
,
''
said
Jones
.
``
You
must
not
be
*NL*
angry
with
me
,
in
whatever
light
it
may
be
necessary
to
set
this
*NL*
affair
,
which
,
you
may
depend
on
it
,
could
not
otherwise
be
long
hid
*NL*
from
him
:
for
things
of
this
nature
make
a
quick
progress
when
once
*NL*
they
get
abroad
,
as
this
unhappily
hath
already

Besides
,
should
any
*NL*
fatal
accident
follow
,
as
upon
my
soul
I
am
afraid
will
,
unless
*NL*
immediately
prevented

public
would
ring
of
your
name
in
a
manner
*NL*

,
if

hath
common
humanity

must
offend
him

If
you
*NL*
will
therefore
tell
me
where
I
may
find

old

I
will
not

lose
a
moment

business

you
can

more
generous

paying

not

in

wretchedness
of

*NL*
*NL*
Nightingale
immediately
consented
to
the
proposal
;
and
now
,
having
*NL*
acquainted
Jones
with
his
father
's
lodging
,
and
the
coffee-house
where
*NL*
he
would
most
probably
find
him
,
he
hesitated
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
*NL*
``
My
dear
Tom
,
you
are
going
to
undertake
an
impossibility

If

my

you
would
never
think
of
obtaining
his
consent

Stay
,
*NL*
there
is
one
way
--
suppose
you
told
him
I
was
already
married
,
it
might
*NL*
be
easier
to
reconcile
him
to
the
fact
after
it
was
done
;
and
,
upon
my
*NL*
honour

I
am
so
affected
with
what

done

might
be
the
*NL*
consequence

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
greatly
approved
the
hint
,
and
promised
to
pursue
it
.
They
then
*NL*
separated

Nightingale
to
visit
his
Nancy

Jones
in
quest
of

old

*NL*
*NL*
What
passed
between
Jones
and
old
Mr
Nightingale
;
with
the
arrival
of
*NL*
a
person
not
yet
mentioned
in
this
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
sentiment
of
the
Roman
satirist
,
which
denies
the
*NL*
divinity
of
fortune
,
and
the
opinion
of
Seneca
to
the
same
purpose
;
*NL*
Cicero
,
who
was
,
I
believe
,
a
wiser
man
than
either
of
them
,
expressly
*NL*
holds
the
contrary
;
and
certain
it
is
,
there
are
some
incidents
in
*NL*
life
so
very
strange
and
unaccountable
,
that
it
seems
to
require
more
*NL*
than
human
skill
and
foresight
in
producing
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
kind
was
what
now
happened
to
Jones
,
who
found
Mr
Nightingale
*NL*
the
elder
in
so
critical
a
minute
,
that
Fortune
,
if
she
was
really
*NL*
worthy
all
the
worship
she
received
at
Rome
,
could
not
have
contrived
*NL*
such
another
.
In
short
,
the
old
gentleman
,
and
the
father
of
the
young
*NL*
lady
whom
he
intended
for
his
son
,
had
been
hard
at
it
for
many
hours
;
*NL*
and
the
latter
was
just
now
gone
,
and
had
left
the
former
delighted
*NL*
with
the
thoughts
that
he
had
succeeded
in
a
long
contention
,
which
*NL*
had
been
between
the
two
fathers
of
the
future
bride
and
bridegroom
;
*NL*
in
which
both
endeavoured
to
overreach
the
other
,
and
,
as
it
not
*NL*
rarely
happens
in
such
cases
,
both
had
retreated
fully
satisfied
of
*NL*
having
obtained
the
victory
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gentleman
,
whom
Mr
Jones
now
visited
,
was
what
they
call
a
man
of
*NL*
the
world
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
man
who
directs
his
conduct
in
this
world
*NL*
as
one
who
,
being
fully
persuaded
there
is
no
other
,
is
resolved
to
*NL*
make
the
most
of
this
.
In
his
early
years
he
had
been
bred
to
trade
;
*NL*
but
,
having
acquired
a
very
good
fortune
,
he
had
lately
declined
his
*NL*
business
;
or
,
to
speak
more
properly
,
had
changed
it
from
dealing
in
*NL*
goods
,
to
dealing
only
in
money
,
of
which
he
had
always
a
plentiful
*NL*
fund
at
command
,
and
of
which
he
knew
very
well
how
to
make
a
very
*NL*
plentiful
advantage
,
sometimes
of
the
necessities
of
private
men
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
of
those
of
the
public
.
He
had
indeed
conversed
so
entirely
*NL*
with
money
,
that
it
may
be
almost
doubted
whether
he
imagined
there
*NL*
was
any
other
thing
really
existing
in
the
world
;
this
at
least
may
be
*NL*
certainly
averred
,
that
he
firmly
believed
nothing
else
to
have
any
*NL*
real
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
,
I
fancy
,
allow
that
Fortune
could
not
have
culled
out
*NL*
a
more
improper
person
for
Mr
Jones
to
attack
with
any
probability
of
*NL*
success
;
nor
could
the
whimsical
lady
have
directed
this
attack
at
a
*NL*
more
unseasonable
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
money
then
was
always
uppermost
in
this
gentleman
's
thoughts
,
so
*NL*
the
moment
he
saw
a
stranger
within
his
doors
it
immediately
occurred
*NL*
to
his
imagination
,
that
such
stranger
was
either
come
to
bring
him
*NL*
money
,
or
to
fetch
it
from
him
.
And
according
as
one
or
other
of
these
*NL*
thoughts
prevailed
,
he
conceived
a
favourable
or
unfavourable
idea
of
*NL*
the
person
who
approached
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unluckily
for
Jones
,
the
latter
of
these
was
the
ascendant
at
present
;
*NL*
for
as
a
young
gentleman
had
visited
him
the
day
before
,
with
a
bill
*NL*
from
his
son
for
a
play
debt
,
he
apprehended
,
at
the
first
sight
of
*NL*
Jones
,
that
he
was
come
on
such
another
errand
.
Jones
therefore
had
no
*NL*
sooner
told
him
that
he
was
come
on
his
son
's
account
than
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
being
confirmed
in
his
suspicion
,
burst
forth
into
an
*NL*
exclamation
,
``
That
he
would
lose
his
labour
.
''
``
Is
it
then
possible
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
that
you
can
guess
my
business
?
''
``
If
I
do
guess
*NL*
it
,
''
replied
the
other
,
``
I
repeat
again
to
you
,
you
will
lose
your
*NL*
labour
.
What
,
I
suppose
you
are
one
of
those
sparks
who
lead
my
son
*NL*
into
all
those
scenes
of
riot
and
debauchery
,
which
will
be
his
*NL*
destruction
?
but
I
shall
pay
no
more
of
his
bills
,
I
promise
you
.
I
*NL*
expect
he
will
quit
all
such
company
for
the
future
.
If
I
had
imagined
*NL*
otherwise
,
I
should
not
have
provided
a
wife
for
him
;
for
I
would
be
*NL*
instrumental
in
the
ruin
of
nobody
.
''
``
How
,
sir
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
and
was
*NL*
this
lady
of
your
providing
?
''
``
Pray
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
old
gentleman
,
*NL*
``
how
comes
it
to
be
any
concern
of
yours
?
''
--
``
Nay
,
dear
sir
,
''
replied
*NL*
Jones
,
``
be
not
offended
that
I
interest
myself
in
what
regards
your
*NL*
son
's
happiness
,
for
whom
I
have
so
great
an
honour
and
value
.
It
was
*NL*
upon
that
very
account
I
came
to
wait
upon
you
.
I
ca
n't
express
the
*NL*
satisfaction
you
have
given
me
by
what
you
say
;
for
I
do
assure
you
*NL*
your
son
is
a
person
for
whom
I
have
the
highest
honour
.
--
Nay
,
sir
,
it
*NL*
is
not
easy
to
express
the
esteem
I
have
for
you
;
who
could
be
so
*NL*
generous
,
so
good
,
so
kind
,
so
indulgent
to
provide
such
a
match
for
*NL*
your
son
;
a
woman
,
who
,
I
dare
swear
,
will
make
him
one
of
the
*NL*
happiest
men
upon
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
scarce
anything
which
so
happily
introduces
men
to
our
good
*NL*
liking
,
as
having
conceived
some
alarm
at
their
first
appearance
;
when
*NL*
once
those
apprehensions
begin
to
vanish
we
soon
forget
the
fears
*NL*
which
they
occasioned
,
and
look
on
ourselves
as
indebted
for
our
*NL*
present
ease
to
those
very
persons
who
at
first
raised
our
fears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
happened
to
Nightingale
,
who
no
sooner
found
that
Jones
had
no
*NL*
demand
on
him
,
as
he
suspected
,
than
he
began
to
be
pleased
with
his
*NL*
presence
.
``
Pray
,
good
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
be
pleased
to
sit
down
.
I
do
not
*NL*
remember
to
have
ever
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
before
;
but
if
*NL*
you
are
a
friend
of
my
son
,
and
have
anything
to
say
concerning
this
*NL*
young
lady
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
hear
you
.
As
to
her
making
him
happy
,
*NL*
it
will
be
his
own
fault
if
she
doth
not

I
have
discharged
my
duty
,
*NL*
in
taking
care
of
the
main
article
.
She
will
bring
him
a
fortune
*NL*
capable
of
making
any
reasonable
,
prudent
,
sober
man
,
happy
.
''
*NL*
``
Undoubtedly
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
for
she
is
in
herself
a
fortune
;
so
*NL*
beautiful
,
so
genteel
,
so
sweet-tempered
,
and
so
well-educated
;
she
is
*NL*
indeed
a
most
accomplished
young
lady
;
sings
admirably
well
,
and
hath
*NL*
a
most
delicate
hand
at
the
harpsichord
.
''
``
I
did
not
know
any
of
these
*NL*
matters
,
''
answered
the
old
gentleman
,
``
for
I
never
saw
the
lady
:
but
I
*NL*
do
not
like
her
the
worse
for
what
you
tell
me
;
and
I
am
the
better
*NL*
pleased
with
her
father
for
not
laying
any
stress
on
these
*NL*
qualifications
in
our
bargain
.
I
shall
always
think
it
a
proof
of
his
*NL*
understanding
.
A
silly
fellow
would
have
brought
in
these
articles
as
*NL*
an
addition
to
her
fortune
;
but
,
to
give
him
his
due
,
he
never
*NL*
mentioned
any
such
matter
;
though
to
be
sure
they
are
no
*NL*
disparagements
to
a
woman
.
''
``
I
do
assure
you
,
sir
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
she
*NL*
hath
them
all
in
the
most
eminent
degree
:
for
my
part
,
I
own
I
was
*NL*
afraid
you
might
have
been
a
little
backward
,
a
little
less
inclined
*NL*
to
the
match
;
for
your
son
told
me
you
had
never
seen
the
lady
;
*NL*
therefore
I
came
,
sir
,
in
that
case
,
to
entreat
you
,
to
conjure
you
,
*NL*
as
you
value
the
happiness

not
to
be
averse

his
match
*NL*
with
a
woman
who
hath
not
only
all
the
good
qualities
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
,

many
more
.

--
``
If
that
was
your
business

said
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
,

we
are
both
obliged

you

Jones

more

a

answered
the
father

``
Still
more

more

noble

replied
Jones
;
``
and
give
me
leave
to
add

sensible
:
for
sure
*NL*
it
is
little
less
than
madness
to
consider

as
the
sole
*NL*
foundation
of
happiness

Such
a

as
this
with

little

her
*NL*
nothing

the

you
imagine
this

``
What

fortune

cries
Jones
,
``
why
,
too
contemptible
a
one
to
be
named
for
*NL*
your

``
Well

well

well

said
the
other
,

perhaps
he
might
have
*NL*
done
better

That
I
deny

Jones

one
of
the

*NL*
of

--
``
Ay

ay
,

in
point
of
fortune
I

answered
the
*NL*
other
.
``
And
yet
,
as
to
that
now

``
How
much

cries
Jones
,
``
how
much

Why
,
at
the
utmost
,
*NL*
perhaps
L200
.

``
Do
you
mean
to
banter
me

young
gentleman

said
the
*NL*
father
,
a
little
angry
.
``
No
,
upon
my
soul
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
I
am
in
*NL*
earnest
:
nay
,
I
believe
I
have
gone
to
the
utmost
farthing

I
do
*NL*
the
lady
an
injury
,
I
ask
her
pardon
.
''
``
Indeed
you
do
,
''
cries
the
*NL*
father
;
``
I
am
certain
she
hath
fifty
times
that
sum
,
and
she
shall
*NL*
produce
fifty

that
before
I
consent
that
she
shall
marry
my

*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
it
is
too
late
to
talk
of
consent
now
;
if
she
had
*NL*
not
fifty
farthings
your
son
is
married
.
''
--
``
My
son
married
!
''
answered
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
,
with
surprize
.
``
Nay

''
said
Jones
,
``
I
thought
you
*NL*
was
unacquainted
with
it
.
''
``
My
son
married
to
Miss
Harris
!
''
answered
*NL*
he
again
.
``
To
Miss
Harris
!
''
said
Jones
;
``
no
,
sir
;
to
Miss
Nancy
*NL*
Miller
,
the
daughter
of
Mrs
Miller
,
at
whose
house
he
lodged
;
a
young
*NL*
lady
,
who
,
though
her
mother
is
reduced
to
let
lodgings
--
''
--
``
Are
you
*NL*
bantering
,
or
are
you
in
earnest
?
''
cries
the
father
,
with
a
most
*NL*
solemn
voice
.
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
I
scorn
the
character
of
*NL*
a
banterer
.
I
came
to
you
in
most
serious
earnest
,
imagining
,
as
I
*NL*
find
true
,
that
your
son
had
never
dared
acquaint
you
with
a
match
so
*NL*
much
inferior
to
him
in
point
of
fortune
,
though
the
reputation
of
the
*NL*
lady
will
suffer
it
no
longer
to
remain
a
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
father
stood
like
one
struck
suddenly
dumb
at
this
news
,
a
*NL*
gentleman
came
into
the
room
,
and
saluted
him
by
the
name
of
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
these
two
were
in
consanguinity
so
nearly
related
,
they
*NL*
were
in
their
dispositions
almost
the
opposites
to
each
other
.
The
*NL*
brother
who
now
arrived
had
likewise
been
bred
to
trade
,
in
which
he
*NL*
no
sooner
saw
himself
worth
L6000
than
he
purchased
a
small
estate
*NL*
with
the
greatest
part
of
it
,
and
retired
into
the
country
;
where
he
*NL*
married
the
daughter
of
an
unbeneficed
clergyman
;
a
young
lady
,
who
,
*NL*
though
she
had
neither
beauty
nor
fortune
,
had
recommended
herself
to
*NL*
his
choice
entirely
by
her
good
humour
,
of
which
she
possessed
a
very
*NL*
large
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
woman
he
had
,
during
twenty-five
years
,
lived
a
life
more
*NL*
resembling
the
model
which
certain
poets
ascribe
to
the
golden
age
,
*NL*
than
any
of
those
patterns
which
are
furnished
by
the
present
times
.
*NL*
By
her
he
had
four
children
,
but
none
of
them
arrived
at
maturity
,
*NL*
except
only
one
daughter
,
whom
,
in
vulgar
language
,
he
and
his
wife
*NL*
had
spoiled
;
that
is
,
had
educated
with
the
utmost
tenderness
and
*NL*
fondness
,
which
she
returned
to
such
a
degree
,
that
she
had
actually
*NL*
refused
a
very
extraordinary
match
with
a
gentleman
a
little
turned
of
*NL*
forty
,
because
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
part
with
her
parents
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
lady
whom
Mr
Nightingale
had
intended
for
his
son
was
a
near
*NL*
neighbour
of
his
brother
,
and
an
acquaintance
of
his
niece
;
and
in
*NL*
reality
it
was
upon
the
account
of
his
projected
match
that
he
was
now
*NL*
come
to
town
;
not
,
indeed
,
to
forward
,
but
to
dissuade
his
brother
*NL*
from
a
purpose
which
he
conceived
would
inevitably
ruin
his
nephew
;
*NL*
for
he
foresaw
no
other
event
from
a
union
with
Miss
Harris
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
largeness
of
her
fortune
,
as
neither
her
person
*NL*
nor
mind
seemed
to
him
to
promise
any
kind
of
matrimonial
felicity
:
*NL*
for
she
was
very
tall
,
very
thin
,
very
ugly
,
very
affected
,
very
*NL*
silly
,
and
very
ill-natured
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
,
therefore
,
no
sooner
mentioned
the
marriage
of
his
nephew
*NL*
with
Miss
Miller
,
than
he
exprest
the
utmost
satisfaction
;
and
when
*NL*
the
father
had
very
bitterly
reviled
his
son
,
and
pronounced
sentence
*NL*
of
beggary
upon
him
,
the
uncle
began
in
the
following
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
was
a
little
cooler
,
brother
,
I
would
ask
you
whether
you
love
*NL*
your
son
for
his
sake
or
for
your
own
.
You
would
answer
,
I
suppose
,
*NL*
and
so
I
suppose
you
think
,
for
his
sake
;
and
doubtless
it
is
his
*NL*
happiness
which
you
intended
in
the
marriage
you
proposed
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
brother
,
to
prescribe
rules
of
happiness
to
others
hath
always
*NL*
appeared
to
me
very
absurd
,
and
to
insist
on
doing
this
,
very
*NL*
tyrannical
.
It
is
a
vulgar
error
,
I
know
;
but
it
is
,
nevertheless
,
an
*NL*
error
.
And
if
this
be
absurd
in
other
things
,
it
is
mostly
so
in
the
*NL*
affair
of
marriage
,
the
happiness
of
which
depends
entirely
on
the
*NL*
affection
which
subsists
between
the
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
therefore
always
thought
it
unreasonable
in
parents
to
desire
*NL*
to
chuse
for
their
children
on
this
occasion
;
since
to
force
affection
*NL*
is
an
impossible
attempt
;
nay
,
so
much
doth
love
abhor
force
,
that
I
*NL*
know
not
whether
,
through
an
unfortunate
but
uncurable
perverseness
in
*NL*
our
natures
,
it
may
not
be
even
impatient
of
persuasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
however
,
true
that
,
though
a
parent
will
not
,
I
think
,
wisely
*NL*
prescribe
,
he
ought
to
be
consulted
on
this
occasion
;
and
,
in
*NL*
strictness
,
perhaps
,
should
at
least
have
a
negative
voice
.
My
nephew
,
*NL*
therefore
,
I
own
,
in
marrying
,
without
asking
your
advice
,
hath
been
*NL*
guilty
of
a
fault
.
But
,
honestly
speaking
,
brother
,
have
you
not
a
*NL*
little
promoted
this
fault
?
Have
not
your
frequent
declarations
on
*NL*
this
subject
given
him
a
moral
certainty
of
your
refusal
,
where
there
*NL*
was
any
deficiency
in
point
of
fortune
?
Nay
,
doth
not
your
present
*NL*
anger
arise
solely
from
that
deficiency
?
And
if
he
hath
failed
in
his
*NL*
duty
here
,
did
you
not
as
much
exceed
that
authority
when
you
*NL*
absolutely
bargained
with
him
for
a
woman
,
without
his
knowledge
,

Still
I

it

hath
acted

have
asked

concerned

you
yourself
must
and

will
acknowledge
that
you
consulted
his

only

if
he
*NL*
unfortunately
differed
from
you

hath
been
mistaken
in
his
notion

happiness

will
you
,

you
love
your

carry
him
still

wider
from

Will
you
increase

simple
choice

Will
you
endeavour

certain
misery
to

him

may
accidentally
prove
so

In
a

because
he
*NL*
hath
put
it
out
of
your
power
to
make
his
circumstances
as

you
would
,
will
you
distress
them

For
young
Nightingale
was
his
uncle
's
godson
,
and
had
*NL*
lived
more
with
him
than
with
his
father
.
So
that
the
uncle
had
often
*NL*
declared
he
loved
his
nephew
almost
equally
with
his
own
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
fell
into
raptures
with
this
good
gentleman
;
and
when
,
after
*NL*
much
persuasion
,
they
found
the
father
grew
still
more
and
more
*NL*
irritated
,
instead
of
appeased
,
Jones
conducted
the
uncle
to
his
*NL*
nephew
at
the
house
of
Mrs

At
his
return
to
his
lodgings
,
Jones
found
the
situation
of
affairs
*NL*
greatly
altered
from
what
they
had
been
in
at
his
departure
.
The
*NL*
mother
,
the
two
daughters
,
and
young
Mr
Nightingale
,
were
now
sat
down
*NL*
to
supper
together
,
when
the
uncle
was
,
at
his
own
desire
,
introduced
*NL*
without
any
ceremony
into
the
company
,
to
all
of
whom
he
was
well
*NL*
known
;
for
he
had
several
times
visited
his
nephew
at
that
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
immediately
walked
up
to
Miss
Nancy
,
saluted
and
*NL*
wished
her
joy
,
as
he
did
afterwards
the
mother
and
the
other
sister
;
*NL*
and
lastly
,
he
paid
the
proper
compliments
to
his
nephew
,
with
the
*NL*
same
good
humour
and
courtesy
,
as
if
his
nephew
had
married
his
equal
*NL*
or
superior
in
fortune
,
with
all
the
previous
requisites
first
*NL*
performed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Nancy
and
her
supposed
husband
both
turned
pale
,
and
looked
*NL*
rather
foolish
than
otherwise
upon
the
occasion
;
but
Mrs
Miller
took
*NL*
the
first
opportunity
of
withdrawing
;
and
,
having
sent
for
Jones
into
*NL*
the
dining-room
,
she
threw
herself
at
his
feet
,
and
in
a
most
*NL*
passionate
flood
of
tears
,
called
him
her
good
angel
,
the
preserver
of
*NL*
her
poor
little
family
,
with
many
other
respectful
and
endearing
*NL*
appellations
,
and
made
him
every
acknowledgment
which
the
highest
*NL*
benefit
can
extract
from
the
most
grateful
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
first
gust
of
her
passion
was
a
little
over
,
which
she
*NL*
declared
,
if
she
had
not
vented
,
would
have
burst
her
,
she
proceeded
*NL*
to
inform
Mr
Jones
that
all
matters
were
settled
between
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
and
her
daughter
,
and
that
they
were
to
be
married
the
*NL*
next
morning
;
at
which
Mr
Jones
having
expressed
much
pleasure
,
the
*NL*
poor
woman
fell
again
into
a
fit
of
joy
and
thanksgiving
,
which
he
at
*NL*
length
with
difficulty
silenced
,
and
prevailed
on
her
to
return
with
*NL*
him
back
to
the
company
,
whom
they
found
in
the
same
good
humour
in
*NL*
which
they
had
left
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
society
now
past
two
or
three
very
agreeable
hours
*NL*
together
,
in
which
the
uncle
,
who
was
a
very
great
lover
of
his
*NL*
bottle
,
had
so
well
plyed
his
nephew
,
that
this
latter
,
though
not
*NL*
drunk
,
began
to
be
somewhat
flustered
;
and
now
Mr
Nightingale
,
taking
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
with
him
upstairs
into
the
apartment
he
had
lately
*NL*
occupied
,
unbosomed
himself
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
have
been
always
the
best
and
kindest
of
uncles
to
me
,
and
as
*NL*
you
have
shown
such
unparalleled
goodness
in
forgiving
this
match
,
*NL*
which
to
be
sure
may
be
thought
a
little
improvident
,
I
should
never
*NL*
forgive
myself
if
I
attempted
to
deceive
you
in
anything
.
''
He
then
*NL*
confessed
the
truth
,
and
opened
the
whole
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
Jack
?
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
``
and
are
you
really
then
not
*NL*
married
to
this
young
woman
?
''
``
No
,
upon
my
honour
,
''
answered
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
I
have
told
you
the
simple
truth
.
''
``
My
dear
boy
,
''
cries
*NL*
the
uncle
,
kissing
him
,
``
I
am
heartily
glad
to
hear
it
.
I
never
was
*NL*
better
pleased
in
my
life
.
If
you
had
been
married
I
should
have
*NL*
assisted
you
as
much
as
was
in
my
power
to
have
made
the
best
of
a
bad
*NL*
matter
;
but
there
is
a
great
difference
between
considering
a
thing
*NL*
which
is
already
done
and
irrecoverable
,
and
that
which
is
yet
to
do
.
*NL*
Let
your
reason
have
fair
play
,
Jack
,
and
you
will
see
this
match
in
*NL*
so
foolish
and
preposterous
a
light
,
that
there
will
be
no
need
of
any
*NL*
dissuasive
arguments
.
''
``
How
,
sir
?
''
replies
young
Nightingale
,
``
is
*NL*
there
this
difference
between
having
already
done
an
act
,
and
being
in
*NL*
honour
engaged
to
do
it
?
''
``
Pugh
!
''
said
the
uncle
,
``
honour
is
a
*NL*
creature
of
the
world
's
making
,
and
the
world
hath
the
power
of
a
*NL*
creator
over
it
,
and
may
govern
and
direct
it
as
they
please
.
Now
you
*NL*
well
know
how
trivial
these
breaches
of
contract
are
thought
;
even
the
*NL*
grossest
make
but
the
wonder
and
conversation
of
a
day
.
Is
there
a
man
*NL*
who
afterwards
will
be
more
backward
in
giving
you
his
sister
,
or
*NL*
daughter
?
or
is
there
any
sister
or
daughter
who
would
be
more
*NL*
backward
to
receive
you
?
Honour
is
not
concerned
in
these
*NL*
engagements
.
''
``
Pardon
me
,
dear
sir
,
''
cries
Nightingale
,
``
I
can
never
*NL*
think
so
;
and
not
only
honour
,
but
conscience
and
humanity
,
are
*NL*
concerned
.
I
am
well
satisfied
,
that
,
was
I
now
to
disappoint
the
*NL*
young
creature
,
her
death
would
be
the
consequence
,
and
I
should
look
*NL*
upon
myself
as
her
murderer
;
nay
,
as
her
murderer
by
the
cruellest
of
*NL*
all
methods
,
by
breaking
her
heart
.
''
``
Break
her
heart
,
indeed
!
no

no

*NL*
Jack
,
''
cries
the
uncle
,
``
the
hearts
of
women
are
not
so
soon
broke

they
are
tough

``
But
,
sir

answered
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
my
own
affections
are
engaged

and
I
never
could
be
*NL*
happy
with
any
other
woman

How
often
have
I
heard
you
say
,
that
*NL*
children
should
be
always
suffered
to
chuse
for
themselves
,
and
that
*NL*
you
would
let
my
cousin
Harriet
do
so
?
''
``
Why
,
ay
,
''
replied
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
``
so
I
would
have
them
;
but
then
I
would
have
them
chuse
*NL*
wisely

Indeed

Jack
,
you
must
and
shall
leave
the
girl
.
''
--
``
Indeed
,
*NL*
uncle
,
''
cries
the
other
,
``
I
must
and
will
have
her
.
''
``
You
will
,
young
*NL*
gentleman
;
''
said
the
uncle
;
``
I
did
not
expect
such
a
word
from
you
.
I
*NL*
should
not
wonder
if
you
had
used
such
language
to
your
father
,
who
*NL*
hath
always
treated
you
like
a
dog
,
and
kept
you
at
the
distance
which
*NL*
a
tyrant
preserves
over
his
subjects
;
but
I
,
who
have
lived
with
you
*NL*
upon
an
equal
footing
,
might
surely
expect
better
usage
:
but
I
know
*NL*
how
to
account
for
it
all
:
it
is
all
owing
to
your
preposterous
*NL*
education
,
in
which
I
have
had
too
little
share
.
There
is
my
daughter
,
*NL*
now
,
whom
I
have
brought
up
as
my
friend
,
never
doth
anything
without
*NL*
my
advice

ever
refuses
to
take
it
when
I
give
it
her

``
You
have
*NL*
never
yet
given
her
advice
in
an
affair
of
this
kind

said
*NL*
Nightingale
;
``
for
I
am
greatly
mistaken
in
my
cousin
,
if
she
would
be
*NL*
very
ready
to
obey
even
your
most
positive
commands
in
abandoning
her
*NL*
inclinations
.
''
``
Do
n't
abuse
my
girl
,
''
answered
the
old
gentleman
with
*NL*
some
emotion
;
``
do
n't
abuse
my
Harriet
.
I
have
brought
her
up
to
have
*NL*
no
inclinations
contrary
to
my
own
.
By
suffering
her
to
do
whatever
*NL*
she
pleases
,
I
have
enured
her
to
a
habit
of
being
pleased
to
do
*NL*
whatever
I
like

''
``
Pardon
,
me
,
sir

said
Nightingale
,
``
I
have
not
the
*NL*
least
design
to
reflect
on

cousin

for

I
have
the
greatest

esteem
;

indeed
I
am
convinced
you
will
never
put
her
to
so
severe
*NL*
a
tryal

lay
such
hard
commands

as
you
would
do
on
me

But
,
*NL*
dear
sir
,
let
us
return
to
the
company
;
for
they
will
begin
to
be
*NL*
uneasy
at
our
long
absence

I
must
beg
one
favour
of
my
dear
uncle
,
*NL*
which
is
that
he
would
not
say
anything
to
shock
the
poor
girl
or
her
*NL*
mother

``
Oh
!
you
need
not
fear
me

answered
he
,
``
I
understand
myself

too
well
to
affront
women

so
I
will
readily
grant
you
that
favour

in
return
I
must
expect
another
of
you

``
There
are
but
few
of

your
commands

Nightingale
,
``
which
I
shall
not
very
*NL*
chearfully

``
Nay

I
ask
nothing

said
the
uncle

``
but
the

honour
of

company
home

that
I
may
reason
the

a
little
more
fully
with

*NL*
*NL*
Nightingale
,
who
well
knew
his
uncle
to
be
as
headstrong
as
his

father
,
submitted
to
attend
him
home
,
and
then
they
both
returned
back
*NL*
into
the
room
,
where
the
old
gentleman
promised
to
carry
himself
with

the
same
decorum
which
he
had
before
maintained

A

chapter

*NL*
*NL*

The
long
absence
of
the
uncle
and
nephew
had
occasioned
some
disquiet
*NL*
in
the
minds
of
all
whom
they
had
left
behind
them
;
and
the
more
,
as
,
*NL*
during
the
preceding
dialogue
,
the
uncle
had
more
than
once
elevated
*NL*
his
voice
,
so
as
to
be
heard
downstairs
;
which
,
though
they
could
not
*NL*
distinguish
what
he
said
,
had
caused
some
evil
foreboding
in
Nancy
and
*NL*
her
mother
,
and
,
indeed
,
even
in
Jones
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
good
company
,
therefore
,
again
assembled
,
there
was
a
visible
*NL*
alteration
in
all
their
faces
;
and
the
good-humour
which
,
at
their
*NL*
last
meeting
,
universally
shone
forth
in
every
countenance
,
was
now
*NL*
changed
into
a
much
less
agreeable
aspect
.
It
was
a
change
,
indeed
,
*NL*
common
enough
to
the
weather
in
this
climate
,
from
sunshine
to
clouds
,
*NL*
from
June
to
December
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
alteration
was
not
,
however
,
greatly
remarked
by
any
present
;
for
*NL*
as
they
were
all
now
endeavouring
to
conceal
their
own
thoughts
,
and
*NL*
to
act
a
part
,
they
became
all
too
busily
engaged
in
the
scene
to
be
*NL*
spectators
of
it
.
Thus
neither
the
uncle
nor
nephew
saw
any
symptoms
*NL*
of
suspicion
in
the
mother
or
daughter
;
nor
did
the
mother
or
daughter
*NL*
remark
the
overacted
complacence
of
the
old
man
,
nor
the
counterfeit
*NL*
satisfaction
which
grinned
in
the
features
of
the
young
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
like
this
,
I
believe
,
frequently
happens
,
where
the
whole
*NL*
attention
of
two
friends
being
engaged
in
the
part
which
each
is
to
*NL*
act
,
in
order
to
impose
on
the
other
,
neither
sees
nor
suspects
the
*NL*
arts
practised
against
himself
;
and
thus
the
thrust
of
both
-LRB-
to
borrow
*NL*
no
improper
metaphor
on
the
occasion
-RRB-
alike
takes
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
same
reason
it
is
no
unusual
thing
for
both
parties
to
be
*NL*
overreached
in
a
bargain
,
though
the
one
must
be
always
the
greater
*NL*
loser
;
as
was
he
who
sold
a
blind
horse
,
and
received
a
bad
note
in
*NL*
payment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
company
in
about
half
an
hour
broke
up
,
and
the
uncle
carried
off
*NL*
his
nephew
;
but
not
before
the
latter
had
assured
Miss
Nancy
,
in
a
*NL*
whisper
,
that
he
would
attend
her
early
in
the
morning
,
and
fulfil
all
*NL*
his
engagements
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
who
was
the
least
concerned
in
this
scene
,
saw
the
most
.
He
did
*NL*
indeed
suspect
the
very
fact
;
for
,
besides
observing
the
great
*NL*
alteration
in
the
behaviour
of
the
uncle
,
the
distance
he
assumed
,
and
*NL*
his
overstrained
civility
to
Miss
Nancy
;
the
carrying
off
a
bridegroom
*NL*
from
his
bride
at
that
time
of
night
was
so
extraordinary
a
proceeding
*NL*
that
it
could
be
accounted
for
only
by
imagining
that
young
*NL*
Nightingale
had
revealed
the
whole
truth
,
which
the
apparent
openness
*NL*
of
his
temper
,
and
his
being
flustered
with
liquor
,
made
too
probable
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
reasoning
with
himself
,
whether
he
should
acquaint
these
*NL*
poor
people
with
his
suspicion
,
the
maid
of
the
house
informed
him
*NL*
that
a
gentlewoman
desired
to
speak
with
him
.
--
He
went
immediately
*NL*
out
,
and
,
taking
the
candle
from
the
maid
,
ushered
his
visitant
*NL*
upstairs
,
who
,
in
the
person
of
Mrs
Honour
,
acquainted
him
with
such
*NL*
dreadful
news
concerning
his
Sophia
,
that
he
immediately
lost
all
*NL*
consideration
for
every
other
person
;
and
his
whole
stock
of
*NL*
compassion
was
entirely
swallowed
up
in
reflections
on
his
own
misery
,
*NL*
and
on
that
of
his
unfortunate
angel
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
this
dreadful
matter
was
,
the
reader
will
be
informed
,
after
we
*NL*
have
first
related
the
many
preceding
steps
which
produced
it
,
and
*NL*
those
will
be
the
subject
of
the
following

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i.
*NL*
*NL*
Too
short
to
need
a
preface
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
a
set
of
religious
,
or
rather
moral
writers
,
who
teach
that
*NL*
virtue
is
the
certain
road
to
happiness
,
and
vice
to
misery
,
in
this
*NL*
world
.
A
very
wholesome
and
comfortable
doctrine
,
and
to
which
we
have
*NL*
but
one
objection
,
namely
,
that
it
is
not
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
if
by
virtue
these
writers
mean
the
exercise
of
those
cardinal
*NL*
virtues
,
which
like
good
housewives
stay
at
home
,
and
mind
only
the
*NL*
business
of
their
own
family
,
I
shall
very
readily
concede
the
point
;
*NL*
for
so
surely
do
all
these
contribute
and
lead
to
happiness
,
that
I
*NL*
could
almost
wish
,
in
violation
of
all
the
antient
and
modern
sages
,
*NL*
to
call
them
rather
by
the
name
of
wisdom
,
than
by
that
of
virtue
;
*NL*
for
,
with
regard
to
this
life
,
no
system
,
I
conceive
,
was
ever
wiser
*NL*
than
that
of
the
antient
Epicureans
,
who
held
this
wisdom
to
*NL*
constitute
the
chief
good
;
nor
foolisher
than
that
of
their
opposites
,
*NL*
those
modern
epicures
,
who
place
all
felicity
in
the
abundant
*NL*
gratification
of
every
sensual
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
by
virtue
is
meant
-LRB-
as
I
almost
think
it
ought
-RRB-
a
certain
*NL*
relative
quality
,
which
is
always
busying
itself
without-doors
,
and
*NL*
seems
as
much
interested
in
pursuing
the
good
of
others
as
its
own
;
I
*NL*
can
not
so
easily
agree
that
this
is
the
surest
way
to
human
happiness
;
*NL*
because
I
am
afraid
we
must
then
include
poverty
and
contempt
,
with
*NL*
all
the
mischiefs
which
backbiting
,
envy
,
and
ingratitude
,
can
bring
*NL*
on
mankind
,
in
our
idea
of
happiness
;
nay
,
sometimes
perhaps
we
shall
*NL*
be
obliged
to
wait
upon
the
said
happiness
to
a
jail
;
since
many
by
*NL*
the
above
virtue
have
brought
themselves
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
not
now
leisure
to
enter
upon
so
large
a
field
of
speculation
,
*NL*
as
here
seems
opening
upon
me
;
my
design
was
to
wipe
off
a
doctrine
*NL*
that
lay
in
my
way
;
since
,
while
Mr
Jones
was
acting
the
most
virtuous
*NL*
part
imaginable
in
labouring
to
preserve
his
fellow-creatures
from
*NL*
destruction
,
the
devil
,
or
some
other
evil
spirit
,
one
perhaps
*NL*
cloathed
in
human
flesh
,
was
hard
at
work
to
make
him
completely
*NL*
miserable
in
the
ruin
of
his
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
therefore
would
seem
an
exception
to
the
above
rule
,
if
indeed
it
*NL*
was
a
rule
;
but
as
we
have
in
our
voyage
through
life
seen
so
many
*NL*
other
exceptions
to
it
,
we
chuse
to
dispute
the
doctrine
on
which
it
*NL*
is
founded
,
which
we
do
n't
apprehend
to
be
Christian
,
which
we
are
*NL*
convinced
is
not
true
,
and
which
is
indeed
destructive
of
one
of
the
*NL*
noblest
arguments
that
reason
alone
can
furnish
for
the
belief
of
*NL*
immortality
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
the
reader
's
curiosity
-LRB-
if
he
hath
any
-RRB-
must
be
now
awake
,
and
*NL*
hungry
,
we
shall
provide
to
feed
it
as
fast
as
we
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
ii
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
is
opened
a
very
black
design
against
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
a
wise
old
gentleman
who
used
to
say
,
``
When
children
are
*NL*
doing
nothing
,
they
are
doing
mischief
.
''
I
will
not
enlarge
this
*NL*
quaint
saying
to
the
most
beautiful
part
of
the
creation
in
general
;
*NL*
but
so
far
I
may
be
allowed
,
that
when
the
effects
of
female
jealousy
*NL*
do
not
appear
openly
in
their
proper
colours
of
rage
and
fury
,
we
may
*NL*
suspect
that
mischievous
passion
to
be
at
work
privately
,
and
*NL*
attempting
to
undermine
,
what
it
doth
not
attack
above-ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
exemplified
in
the
conduct
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
,
under
all
*NL*
the
smiles
which
she
wore
in
her
countenance
,
concealed
much
*NL*
indignation
against
Sophia
;
and
as
she
plainly
saw
that
this
young
*NL*
lady
stood
between
her
and
the
full
indulgence
of
her
desires
,
she
*NL*
resolved
to
get
rid
of
her
by
some
means
or
other
;
nor
was
it
long
*NL*
before
a
very
favourable
opportunity
of
accomplishing
this
presented
*NL*
itself
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
be
pleased
to
remember
,
that
when
Sophia
was
thrown
*NL*
into
that
consternation
at
the
playhouse
,
by
the
wit
and
humour
of
a
*NL*
set
of
young
gentlemen
who
call
themselves
the
town
,
we
informed
him
,
*NL*
that
she
had
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
a
young
nobleman
,
who
*NL*
had
very
safely
conducted
her
to
her
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
nobleman
,
who
frequently
visited
Lady
Bellaston
,
had
more
than
*NL*
once
seen
Sophia
there
,
since
her
arrival
in
town
,
and
had
conceived
a
*NL*
very
great
liking
to
her
;
which
liking
,
as
beauty
never
looks
more
*NL*
amiable
than
in
distress
,
Sophia
had
in
this
fright
so
encreased
,
that
*NL*
he
might
now
,
without
any
great
impropriety
,
be
said
to
be
actually
in
*NL*
love
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
easily
be
believed
,
that
he
would
not
suffer
so
handsome
an
*NL*
occasion
of
improving
his
acquaintance
with
the
beloved
object
as
now
*NL*
offered
itself
to
elapse
,
when
even
good
breeding
alone
might
have
*NL*
prompted
him
to
pay
her
a
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
therefore
,
after
this
accident
,
he
waited
on
Sophia
,
*NL*
with
the
usual
compliments
,
and
hopes
that
she
had
received
no
harm
*NL*
from
her
last
night
's
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
love
,
like
fire
,
when
once
thoroughly
kindled
,
is
soon
blown
into
a
*NL*
flame
,
Sophia
in
a
very
short
time
compleated
her
conquest
.
Time
now
*NL*
flew
away
unperceived
,
and
the
noble
lord
had
been
two
hours
in
*NL*
company
with
the
lady
,
before
it
entered
into
his
head
that
he
had
*NL*
made
too
long
a
visit
.
Though
this
circumstance
alone
would
have
*NL*
alarmed
Sophia
,
who
was
somewhat
more
a
mistress
of
computation
at
*NL*
present
;
she
had
indeed
much
more
pregnant
evidence
from
the
eyes
of
*NL*
her
lover
of
what
past
within
his
bosom
;
nay
,
though
he
did
not
make
*NL*
any
open
declaration
of
his
passion
,
yet
many
of
his
expressions
were
*NL*
rather
too
warm
,
and
too
tender
,
to
have
been
imputed
to
complacence
,
*NL*
even
in
the
age
when
such
complacence
was
in
fashion
;
the
very
reverse
*NL*
of
which
is
well
known
to
be
the
reigning
mode
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
had
been
apprized
of
his
lordship
's
visit
at
his
first
*NL*
arrival
;
and
the
length
of
it
very
well
satisfied
her
,
that
things
*NL*
went
as
she
wished
,
and
as
indeed
she
had
suspected
the
second
time
*NL*
she
saw
this
young
couple
together
.
This
business
,
she
rightly
I
think
*NL*
concluded
,
that
she
should
by
no
means
forward
by
mixing
in
the
*NL*
company
while
they
were
together
;
she
therefore
ordered
her
servants
,
*NL*
that
when
my
lord
was
going
,
they
should
tell
him
she
desired
to
speak
*NL*
with
him
;
and
employed
the
intermediate
time
in
meditating
how
best
to
*NL*
accomplish
a
scheme
,
which
she
made
no
doubt
but
his
lordship
would
*NL*
very
readily
embrace
the
execution
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Fellamar
-LRB-
for
that
was
the
title
of
this
young
nobleman
-RRB-
was
no
*NL*
sooner
introduced
to
her
ladyship
,
than
she
attacked
him
in
the
*NL*
following
strain
:
``
Bless
me
,
my
lord
,
are
you
here
yet
?
I
thought
my
*NL*
servants
had
made
a
mistake
,
and
let
you
go
away
;
and
I
wanted
to
see
*NL*
you
about
an
affair
of
some
importance
.
''
--
``
Indeed
,
Lady
Bellaston
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
I
do
n't
wonder
you
are
astonished
at
the
length
of
my
*NL*
visit
;
for
I
have
staid
above
two
hours
,
and
I
did
not
think
I
had
*NL*
staid
above
half-a-one
.
''
--
``
What
am
I
to
conclude
from
thence
,
my
*NL*
lord
?
''
said
she
.
``
The
company
must
be
very
agreeable
which
can
make
*NL*
time
slide
away
so
very
deceitfully
.
''
--
``
Upon
my
honour
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
the
most
agreeable
I
ever
saw
.
Pray
tell
me
,
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
is
*NL*
this
blazing
star
which
you
have
produced
among
us
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
?
''
--
``
What
blazing
star
,
my
lord
?
''
said
she
,
affecting
a
*NL*
surprize
.
``
I
mean

''
said
he
,
``
the
lady
I
saw
here
the
other
day

*NL*
I
had
last
night
in
my
arms
at
the
playhouse
,
and
to
whom
I
have
been
*NL*
making
that
unreasonable
visit
.
''
--
``
O
,
my
cousin
Western
!
''
said
she
;
*NL*
``
why
,
that
blazing
star
,
my
lord

is
the
daughter
of
a
country
booby
*NL*
squire

hath
been
in
town
about
a
fortnight
,
for
the
first
*NL*
time
.
''
--
``
Upon
my
soul
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
should
swear
she
had
been
bred
*NL*
up
in
a
court
;
for
besides
her
beauty
,
I
never
saw
anything
so
*NL*
genteel
,
so
sensible

so
polite

--
``
O
brave
!

cries
the
lady
,
``
my
*NL*
cousin

I
find

``
Upon
my
honour

he
,
``
I
wish

for
I
am
in
love
with
her
to
distraction

``
Nay

my
*NL*
lord

said
she
,
``
it
is
not
wishing
yourself
very
ill
neither

she

a
very
great
fortune

you
she
is
an
only
child

*NL*
her

``
Then
I
can
assure
you

answered
the
lord
,
``
I
think
her
the
best
match
in
England

*NL*
``

replied
she
,
``

you
like

I
heartily
wish

``
If
you
think
so
kindly

said
he
,
``
as
she

you
do
me
the
honour

``

cries
the
lady
,
with

an
affected
gravity

``
I
hope

answered
he
,
``
you
have
a
better

jest
with

``
Indeed

said
the
lady
,

I
will
most

readily
propose

I
can

I
believe

assure
you
of
his
joyful
acceptance

there
is
a

bar

I
am
almost
ashamed

it

he
,

have
struck
a
damp
to

almost
deprived

*NL*
imagined
you
would
have
asked
your
rival
's
name
,
that
you
might
have
*NL*
immediately
entered
the
lists
with
him
.
''
``
I
promise
you
,
madam
,
''
*NL*
answered
he
,
``
there
are
very
few
things
I
would
not
undertake
for
*NL*
your
charming
cousin
;
but
pray
,
who
is
this
happy
man
?
''
--
``
Why
,
he
*NL*
is
,
''
said
she
,
``
what
I
am
sorry
to
say
most
happy
men
with
us
are
,
*NL*
one
of
the
lowest
fellows
in
the
world
.
He
is
a
beggar
,
a
bastard
,
a
*NL*
foundling
,
a
fellow
in
meaner
circumstances
than
one
of
your
*NL*
lordship
's
footmen
.
''
``
And
is
it
possible
,
''
cried
he
,
``
that
a
young
*NL*
creature
with
such
perfections
should
think
of
bestowing
herself
so
*NL*
unworthily
?
''
``
Alas
!
my
lord
,
''
answered
she
,
``
consider
the
*NL*
country
--
the
bane
of
all
young
women
is
the
country
.
There
they
learn
*NL*
a
set
of
romantic
notions
of
love
,
and
I
know
not
what
folly
,
which
*NL*
this
town
and
good
company
can
scarce
eradicate
in
a
whole
winter
.
''
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
replied
my
lord
,
``
your
cousin
is
of
too
immense
a
*NL*
value
to
be
thrown
away
;
such
ruin
as
this
must
be
prevented
.
''
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
cries
she
,
``
my
lord
,
how
can
it
be
prevented
?
The
family
have
*NL*
already
done
all
in
their
power
;
but
the
girl
is
,
I
think
,
*NL*
intoxicated
,
and
nothing
less
than
ruin
will
content
her
.
And
to
deal
*NL*
more
openly
with
you
,
I
expect
every
day
to
hear
she
is
run
away
with
*NL*
him
.
''
``
What
you
tell
me
,
Lady
Bellaston
,
''
answered
his
lordship
,
*NL*
``
affects
me
most
tenderly
,
and
only
raises
my
compassion
,
instead
of
*NL*
lessening
my
adoration
of
your
cousin
.
Some
means
must
be
found
to
*NL*
preserve
so
inestimable
a
jewel
.
Hath
your
ladyship
endeavoured
to
*NL*
reason
with
her
?
''
Here
the
lady
affected
a
laugh
,
and
cried
,
``
My
dear
*NL*
lord
,
sure
you
know
us
better
than
to
talk
of
reasoning
a
young
woman
*NL*
out
of
her
inclinations
?
These
inestimable
jewels
are
as
deaf
as
the
*NL*
jewels
they
wear
:
time
,
my
lord
,
time
is
the
only
medicine
to
cure
*NL*
their
folly
;
but
this
is
a
medicine
which
I
am
certain
she
will
not
*NL*
take
;
nay
,
I
live
in
hourly
horrors
on
her
account
.
In
short
,
nothing
*NL*
but
violent
methods
will
do
.
''
``
What
is
to
be
done
?
''
cries
my
lord
;
*NL*
``
what
methods
are
to
be
taken
?
--
Is
there
any
method
upon
earth
?
--
Oh
!
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
!
there
is
nothing
which
I
would
not
undertake
for
such
*NL*
a
reward
.
''
--
``
I
really
know
not
,
''
answered
the
lady
,
after
a
pause
;
*NL*
and
then
pausing
again
,
she
cried
out
--
``
Upon
my
soul
,
I
am
at
my
*NL*
wit
's
end
on
this
girl
's
account

If
she
can
be
preserved
,
something
*NL*
must
be
done
immediately
;
and
,
as
I
say
,
nothing
but
violent
methods
*NL*
will
do
.
--
If
your
lordship
hath
really
this
attachment
to
my
cousin
*NL*
-LRB-

to
do
her
justice
,
except
in
this
silly
inclination
,
of
which
*NL*
she
will
soon
see
her
folly

she
is
every
way
deserving
-RRB-
,
I
think
*NL*
there
may
be
one
way
,
indeed
,
it
is
a
very
disagreeable
one
,
and
what
*NL*
I
am
almost
afraid
to
think
of
.
--
It
requires
a
great
spirit
,
I
*NL*
promise
you
.
''
``
I
am
not
conscious
,
madam
,
''
said
he
,
``
of
any
defect
*NL*
there
;
nor
am
I
,
I
hope
,
suspected
of
any
such
.
It
must
be
an
*NL*
egregious
defect
indeed
,
which
could
make
me
backward
on
this
*NL*
occasion
.
''
``
Nay
,
my
lord
,
''
answered
she
,
``
I
am
so
far
from
doubting
*NL*
you
,
I
am
much
more
inclined
to
doubt
my
own
courage
;
for
I
must
run
*NL*
a
monstrous
risque
.
In
short
,
I
must
place
such
a
confidence
in
your
*NL*
honour
as
a
wise
woman
will
scarce
ever
place
in
a
man
on
any
*NL*
consideration
.
''
In
this
point
likewise
my
lord
very
well
satisfied
*NL*
her
;
for
his
reputation
was
extremely
clear
,
and
common
fame
did
him
*NL*
no
more
than
justice
,
in
speaking
well
of
him
.
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
my
lord

I

I
vow
,
I
ca
n't
bear
the
apprehension
of
it

No

*NL*
it
must
not
be
.
--
At
least
every
other
method
shall
be
tried
.
Can
*NL*
you
get
rid
of
your
engagements
,
and
dine
here
to-day
?
Your
lordship
*NL*
will
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
a
little
more
of
Miss
Western
.

I
*NL*
promise
you
we
have
no
time
to
lose

Here
will
be
nobody
but
Lady

Miss
Eagle

Colonel
Hampsted

and
Tom
Edwards
;
they
*NL*
will
all
go
soon

and
I
shall
be
at
home
to
nobody

Then
your
*NL*
lordship
may
be
a
little
more
explicit
.
Nay
,
I
will
contrive
some
*NL*
method
to
convince
you
of
her
attachment
to
this
fellow

''
My
lord
*NL*
made
proper
compliments
,
accepted
the
invitation
,
and
then
they
*NL*
parted
to
dress
,
it
being
now
past
three
in
the
morning

to
reckon

by

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
A
further
explanation
of
the
foregoing
design
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
reader
may
have
long
since
concluded
Lady
Bellaston
to
be
a
*NL*
member
-LRB-
and
no
inconsiderable
one
-RRB-
of
the
great
world
;
she
was
in
*NL*
reality
a
very
considerable
member
of
the
little
world
;
by
which
*NL*
appellation
was
distinguished
a
very
worthy
and
honourable
society
*NL*
which
not
long
since
flourished
in
this
kingdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
good
principles
upon
which
this
society
was
founded
,
there
*NL*
was
one
very
remarkable
;
for
,
as
it
was
a
rule
of
an
honourable
club
*NL*
of
heroes
,
who
assembled
at
the
close
of
the
late
war
,
that
all
the
*NL*
members
should
every
day
fight
once
at
least
;
so
't
was
in
this
,
that
*NL*
every
member
should
,
within
the
twenty-four
hours
,
tell
at
least
one
*NL*
merry
fib
,
which
was
to
be
propagated
by
all
the
brethren
and
*NL*
sisterhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
idle
stories
were
told
about
this
society
,
which
from
a
certain
*NL*
quality
may
be
,
perhaps
not
unjustly
,
supposed
to
have
come
from
the
*NL*
society
themselves
.
As
,
that
the
devil
was
the
president
;
and
that
he
*NL*
sat
in
person
in
an
elbow-chair
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
;
but
,
*NL*
upon
very
strict
enquiry
,
I
find
there
is
not
the
least
truth
in
any
*NL*
of
those
tales
,
and
that
the
assembly
consisted
in
reality
of
a
set
of
*NL*
very
good
sort
of
people
,
and
the
fibs
which
they
propagated
were
of
a
*NL*
harmless
kind
,
and
tended
only
to
produce
mirth
and
good
humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edwards
was
likewise
a
member
of
this
comical
society
.
To
him
*NL*
therefore
Lady
Bellaston
applied
as
a
proper
instrument
for
her
*NL*
purpose
,
and
furnished
him
with
a
fib
,
which
he
was
to
vent
whenever
*NL*
the
lady
gave
him
her
cue
;
and
this
was
not
to
be
till
the
evening
,
*NL*
when
all
the
company
but
Lord
Fellamar
and
himself
were
gone
,
and
*NL*
while
they
were
engaged
in
a
rubber
at
whist
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
time
then
,
which
was
between
seven
and
eight
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
we
will
convey
our
reader
;
when
Lady
Bellaston
,
Lord
Fellamar
,
Miss
*NL*
Western
,
and
Tom
,
being
engaged
at
whist
,
and
in
the
last
game
of
*NL*
their
rubbers
,
Tom
received
his
cue
from
Lady
Bellaston
,
which
was
,
``
I
*NL*
protest
,
Tom
,
you
are
grown
intolerable
lately
;
you
used
to
tell
us
*NL*
all
the
news
of
the
town
,
and
now
you
know
no
more
of
the
world
than
*NL*
if
you
lived
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Edwards
then
began
as
follows
:
``
The
fault
is
not
mine
,
madam
:
it
*NL*
lies
in
the
dulness
of
the
age
,
that
doth
nothing
worth
talking
*NL*
of
.
--
O
la
!
though
now
I
think
o
n't
there
hath
a
terrible
accident
*NL*
befallen
poor
Colonel
Wilcox
.
--
Poor
Ned
.
--
You
know
him
,
my
lord
,
*NL*
everybody
knows
him
;
faith
!
I
am
very
much
concerned
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
pray
?
''
says
Lady
Bellaston
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
hath
killed
a
man
this
morning
in
a
duel
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
lordship
,
who
was
not
in
the
secret
,
asked
gravely
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
killed
?
To
which
Edwards
answered
,
``
A
young
fellow
we
none
of
us
know
;
*NL*
a
Somersetshire
lad
just
came
to
town
,
one
Jones
his
name
is
;
a
near
*NL*
relation
of
one
Mr
Allworthy
,
of
whom
your
lordship
I
believe
hath
*NL*
heard
.
I
saw
the
lad
lie
dead
in
a
coffee-house
.
--
Upon
my
soul
,
he
is
*NL*
one
of
the
finest
corpses
I
ever
saw
in
my
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
who
had
just
began
to
deal
as
Tom
had
mentioned
that
a
man
was
*NL*
killed
,
stopt
her
hand
,
and
listened
with
attention
-LRB-
for
all
stories
*NL*
of
that
kind
affected
her
-RRB-
,
but
no
sooner
had
he
arrived
at
the
latter
*NL*
part
of
the
story
than
she
began
to
deal
again
;
and
having
dealt
three
*NL*
cards
to
one
,
and
seven
to
another
,
and
ten
to
a
third
,
at
last
dropt
*NL*
the
rest
from
her
hand
,
and
fell
back
in
her
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
behaved
as
usually
on
these
occasions
.
The
usual
*NL*
disturbance
ensued
,
the
usual
assistance
was
summoned
,
and
Sophia
at
*NL*
last
,
as
it
is
usual
,
returned
again
to
life
,
and
was
soon
after
,
at
*NL*
her
earnest
desire
,
led
to
her
own
apartment
;
where
,
at
my
lord
's
*NL*
request
,
Lady
Bellaston
acquainted
her
with
the
truth
,
attempted
to
*NL*
carry
it
off
as
a
jest
of
her
own
,
and
comforted
her
with
repeated
*NL*
assurances
,
that
neither
his
lordship
nor
Tom
,
though
she
had
taught
*NL*
him
the
story
,
were
in
the
true
secret
of
the
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
farther
evidence
necessary
to
convince
Lord
Fellamar
how
*NL*
justly
the
case
had
been
represented
to
him
by
Lady
Bellaston
;
and
*NL*
now
,
at
her
return
into
the
room
,
a
scheme
was
laid
between
these
two
*NL*
noble
persons
,
which
,
though
it
appeared
in
no
very
heinous
light
to
*NL*
his
lordship
-LRB-
as
he
faithfully
promised
,
and
faithfully
resolved
too
,
*NL*
to
make
the
lady
all
the
subsequent
amends
in
his
power
by
marriage
-RRB-
,
*NL*
yet
many
of
our
readers
,
we
doubt
not
,
will
see
with
just
detestation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
evening
at
seven
was
appointed
for
the
fatal
purpose
,
when
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
undertook
that
Sophia
should
be
alone
,
and
his
lordship
*NL*
should
be
introduced
to
her
.
The
whole
family
were
to
be
regulated
for
*NL*
the
purpose
,
most
of
the
servants
despatched
out
of
the
house
;
and
for
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
,
who
,
to
prevent
suspicion
,
was
to
be
left
with
her
*NL*
mistress
till
his
lordship
's
arrival
,
Lady
Bellaston
herself
was
to
*NL*
engage
her
in
an
apartment
as
distant
as
possible
from
the
scene
of
*NL*
the
intended
mischief
,
and
out
of
the
hearing
of
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matters
being
thus
agreed
on
,
his
lordship
took
his
leave
,
and
her
*NL*
ladyship
retired
to
rest
,
highly
pleased
with
a
project
,
of
which
she
*NL*
had
no
reason
to
doubt
the
success
,
and
which
promised
so
effectually
*NL*
to
remove
Sophia
from
being
any
further
obstruction
to
her
amour
with
*NL*
Jones
,
by
a
means
of
which
she
should
never
appear
to
be
guilty
,
even
*NL*
if
the
fact
appeared
to
the
world
;
but
this
she
made
no
doubt
of
*NL*
preventing
by
huddling
up
a
marriage
,
to
which
she
thought
the
*NL*
ravished
Sophia
would
easily
be
brought
to
consent
,
and
at
which
all
*NL*
the
rest
of
her
family
would
rejoice
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
affairs
were
not
in
so
quiet
a
situation
in
the
bosom
of
the
other
*NL*
conspirator
;
his
mind
was
tost
in
all
the
distracting
anxiety
so
nobly
*NL*
described
by
Shakespear
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Between
the
acting
of
a
dreadful
thing
,
*NL*
And
the
first
motion
,
all
the
interim
is
*NL*
Like
a
phantasma
,
or
a
hideous
dream
;
*NL*
The
genius
and
the
mortal
instruments
*NL*
Are
then
in
council
;
and
the
state
of
man
,
*NL*
Like
to
a
little
kingdom
,
suffers
then
*NL*
The
nature
of
an
insurrection
.
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
violence
of
his
passion
had
made
him
eagerly
embrace
the
*NL*
first
hint
of
this
design
,
especially
as
it
came
from
a
relation
of
*NL*
the
lady
,
yet
when
that
friend
to
reflection
,
a
pillow
,
had
placed
the
*NL*
action
itself
in
all
its
natural
black
colours
before
his
eyes
,
with
*NL*
all
the
consequences
which
must
,
and
those
which
might
probably
attend
*NL*
it
,
his
resolution
began
to
abate
,
or
rather
indeed
to
go
over
to
the
*NL*
other
side
;
and
after
a
long
conflict
,
which
lasted
a
whole
night
,
*NL*
between
honour
and
appetite
,
the
former
at
length
prevailed
,
and
he
*NL*
determined
to
wait
on
Lady
Bellaston
,
and
to
relinquish
the

*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
was
in
bed
,
though
very
late
in
the
morning
,
and
Sophia
*NL*
sitting
by
her
bed-side
,
when
the
servant
acquainted
her
that
Lord
*NL*
Fellamar
was
below
in
the
parlour
;
upon
which
her
ladyship
desired
him
*NL*
to
stay
,
and
that
she
would
see
him
presently
;
but
the
servant
was
no
*NL*
sooner
departed
than
poor
Sophia
began
to
intreat
her
cousin
not
to
*NL*
encourage
the
visits
of
that
odious
lord
-LRB-
so
she
called
him
,
though
a
*NL*
little
unjustly
-RRB-
upon
her
account
.
``
I
see
his
design
,
''
said
she
;
``
for
*NL*
he
made
downright
love
to
me
yesterday
morning
;
but
as
I
am
resolved
*NL*
never
to
admit
it
,
I
beg
your
ladyship
not
to
leave
us
alone
together
*NL*
any
more
,
and
to
order
the
servants
that
,
if
he
enquires
for
me
,
I
may
*NL*
be
always
denied
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
La
!
child
,
''
says
Lady
Bellaston
,
``
you
country
girls
have
nothing
but
*NL*
sweethearts
in
your
head
;
you
fancy
every
man
who
is
civil
to
you
is
*NL*
making
love
.
He
is
one
of
the
most
gallant
young
fellows
about
town
,
*NL*
and
I
am
convinced
means
no
more
than
a
little
gallantry
.
Make
love
to
*NL*
you
indeed
!
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
he
would
,
and
you
must
be
an
*NL*
arrant
mad
woman
to
refuse
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
I
shall
certainly
be
that
mad
woman
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
``
I
hope
*NL*
his
visits
shall
not
be
intruded
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
child
!
''
said
Lady
Bellaston
,
``
you
need
not
be
so
fearful
;
if
you
*NL*
resolve
to
run
away
with
that
Jones

I
know
no
person
who
can
hinder
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
honour
,
madam
,
''
cries
Sophia
,
``
your
ladyship
injures
me

I
*NL*
will
never
run
away
with
any
man
;
nor
will
I
ever
marry
contrary
to
my
*NL*
father
's
inclinations

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Miss
Western
,
''
said
the
lady
,
``
if
you
are
not
in
a
humour
to
*NL*
see
company
this
morning
,
you
may
retire
to
your
own
apartment
;
for
I
*NL*
am
not
frightened
at
his
lordship
,
and
must
send
for
him
up
into
my
*NL*
dressing-room

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
thanked
her
ladyship
,
and
withdrew
;
and
presently
afterwards
*NL*
Fellamar
was
admitted
upstairs

Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
which
it
will
appear
how
dangerous
an
advocate
a
lady
is
when
she
*NL*
applies
her
eloquence
to
an
ill
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Lady
Bellaston
heard
the
young
lord
's
scruples
,
she
treated
them
*NL*
with
the
same
disdain
with
which
one
of
those
sages
of
the
law
,
called
*NL*
Newgate
solicitors
,
treats
the
qualms
of
conscience
in
a
young
*NL*
witness
.
``
My
dear
lord
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
certainly
want
a
cordial
.
I
*NL*
must
send
to
Lady
Edgely
for
one
of
her
best
drams
.
Fie
upon
it
!
have
*NL*
more
resolution
.
Are
you
frightened
by
the
word
rape
?
Or
are
you
*NL*
apprehensive
--
?
Well
!
if
the
story
of
Helen
was
modern
,
I
should
*NL*
think
it
unnatural
.
I
mean
the
behaviour
of
Paris
,
not
the
fondness
of
*NL*
the
lady
;
for
all
women
love
a
man
of
spirit
.
There
is
another
story
*NL*
of
the
Sabine
ladies
--
and
that
too
,
I
thank
heaven
,
is
very
antient
.
*NL*
Your
lordship
,
perhaps
,
will
admire
my
reading
;
but
I
think
Mr
Hook
*NL*
tells
us
,
they
made
tolerable
good
wives
afterwards
.
I
fancy
few
of
my
*NL*
married
acquaintance
were
ravished
by
their
husbands
.
''
``
Nay
,
dear
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
,
''
cried
he
,
``
do
n't
ridicule
me
in
this
manner
.
''
``
Why
,
my
*NL*
good
lord
,
''
answered
she
,
``
do
you
think
any
woman
in
England
would
not
*NL*
laugh
at
you
in
her
heart
,
whatever
prudery
she
might
wear
in
her
*NL*
countenance
?
--
You
force
me
to
use
a
strange
kind
of
language
,
and
to
*NL*
betray
my
sex
most
abominably
;
but
I
am
contented
with
knowing
my
*NL*
intentions
are
good
,
and
that
I
am
endeavouring
to
serve
my
cousin
;
*NL*
for
I
think
you
will
make
her
a
husband
notwithstanding
this
;
or
,
upon
*NL*
my
soul
,
I
would
not
even
persuade
her
to
fling
herself
away
upon
an
*NL*
empty
title
.
She
should
not
upbraid
me
hereafter
with
having
lost
a
*NL*
man
of
spirit
;
for
that
his
enemies
allow
this
poor
young
fellow
to
*NL*
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Let
those
who
have
had
the
satisfaction
of
hearing
reflections
of
this
*NL*
kind
from
a
wife
or
a
mistress
,
declare
whether
they
are
at
all
*NL*
sweetened
by
coming
from
a
female
tongue
.
Certain
it
is
,
they
sunk
*NL*
deeper
into
his
lordship
than
anything
which
Demosthenes
or
Cicero
*NL*
could
have
said
on
the
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
,
perceiving
she
had
fired
the
young
lord
's
pride
,
began
*NL*
now
,
like
a
true
orator
,
to
rouse
other
passions
to
its
assistance
.
*NL*
``
My
lord
,
''
says
she
,
in
a
graver
voice
,
``
you
will
be
pleased
to
*NL*
remember
,
you
mentioned
this
matter
to
me
first
;
for
I
would
not
*NL*
appear
to
you
in
the
light
of
one
who
is
endeavouring
to
put
off
my
*NL*
cousin
upon
you
.
Fourscore
thousand
pounds
do
not
stand
in
need
of
an
*NL*
advocate
to
recommend
them
.
''
``
Nor
doth
Miss
Western
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
require
any
recommendation
from
her
fortune
;
for
,
in
my
opinion
,
no
*NL*
woman
ever
had
half
her
charms
.
''
``
Yes
,
yes
,
my
lord
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
lady
,
looking
in
the
glass
,
``
there
have
been
women
with
more
than
half
*NL*
her
charms
,
I
assure
you
;
not
that
I
need
lessen
her
on
that
account
:
*NL*
she
is
a
most
delicious
girl
,
that
's
certain
;
and
within
these
few
*NL*
hours
she
will
be
in
the
arms
of
one
,
who
surely
doth
not
deserve
her
,
*NL*
though
I
will
give
him
his
due
,
I
believe
he
is
truly
a
man
of
*NL*
spirit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
so
,
madam
,
''
said
my
lord
;
``
though
I
must
own
he
doth
not
*NL*
deserve
her
;
for
,
unless
heaven
or
your
ladyship
disappoint
me
,
she
*NL*
shall
within
that
time
be
in
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
spoken
,
my
lord
,
''
answered
the
lady
;
``
I
promise
you
no
*NL*
disappointment
shall
happen
from
my
side
;
and
within
this
week
I
am
*NL*
convinced
I
shall
call
your
lordship
my
cousin
in
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
remainder
of
this
scene
consisted
entirely
of
raptures
,
excuses
,
*NL*
and
compliments
,
very
pleasant
to
have
heard
from
the
parties
;
but
*NL*
rather
dull
when
related
at
second
hand
.
Here
,
therefore
,
we
shall
put
*NL*
an
end
to
this
dialogue
,
and
hasten
to
the
fatal
hour
when
everything
*NL*
was
prepared
for
the
destruction
of
poor
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
being
the
most
tragical
matter
in
our
whole
history
,
we
shall
*NL*
treat
it
in
a
chapter
by
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
v.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
some
matters
which
may
affect
,
and
others
which
may
*NL*
surprize
,
the
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
had
now
struck
seven
,
and
poor
Sophia
,
alone
and
melancholy
,
*NL*
sat
reading
a
tragedy
.
It
was
the
Fatal
Marriage
;
and
she
was
now
come
*NL*
to
that
part
where
the
poor
distrest
Isabella
disposes
of
her
*NL*
wedding-ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
book
dropt
from
her
hand
,
and
a
shower
of
tears
ran
down
into
*NL*
her
bosom
.
In
this
situation
she
had
continued
a
minute
,
when
the
door
*NL*
opened
,
and
in
came
Lord
Fellamar
.
Sophia
started
from
her
chair
at
*NL*
his
entrance
;
and
his
lordship
advancing
forwards
,
and
making
a
low
*NL*
bow
,
said
,
``
I
am
afraid
,
Miss
Western
,
I
break
in
upon
you
abruptly
.
''
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
my
lord
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
must
own
myself
a
little
surprized
at
*NL*
this
unexpected
visit
.
''
``
If
this
visit
be
unexpected
,
madam
,
''
answered
*NL*
Lord
Fellamar
,
``
my
eyes
must
have
been
very
faithless
interpreters
of
*NL*
my
heart
,
when
last
I
had
the
honour
of
seeing
you
;
for
surely
you
*NL*
could
not
otherwise
have
hoped
to
detain
my
heart
in
your
possession
,
*NL*
without
receiving
a
visit
from
its
owner
.
''
Sophia
,
confused
as
she
*NL*
was
,
answered
this
bombast
-LRB-
and
very
properly
I
think
-RRB-
with
a
look
of
*NL*
inconceivable
disdain
.
My
lord
then
made
another
and
a
longer
speech
*NL*
of
the
same
sort
.
Upon
which
Sophia
,
trembling
,
said
,
``
Am
I
really
to
*NL*
conceive
your
lordship
to
be
out
of
your
senses
?
Sure
,
my
lord
,
there
*NL*
is
no
other
excuse
for
such
behaviour
.
''
``
I
am
,
indeed
,
madam
,
in
the
*NL*
situation
you
suppose
,
''
cries
his
lordship
;
``
and
sure
you
will
pardon
*NL*
the
effects
of
a
frenzy
which
you
yourself
have
occasioned
;
for
love
*NL*
hath
so
totally
deprived
me
of
reason
,
that
I
am
scarce
accountable
*NL*
for
any
of
my
actions
.
''
``
Upon
my
word
,
my
lord
,
''
said
Sophia
,
``
I
*NL*
neither
understand
your
words
nor
your
behaviour
.
''
``
Suffer
me
then
,
*NL*
madam
,
''
cries
he
,
``
at
your
feet
to
explain
both
,
by
laying
open
my
*NL*
soul
to
you
,
and
declaring
that
I
doat
on
you
to
the
highest
degree
of
*NL*
distraction
.
O
most
adorable
,
most
divine
creature
!
what
language
can
*NL*
express
the
sentiments
of
my
heart
?
''
``
I
do
assure
you
,
my
lord
,
''
said
*NL*
Sophia
,
``
I
shall
not
stay
to
hear
any
more
of
this
.
''
``
Do
not
,
''
cries
*NL*
he
,
``
think
of
leaving
me
thus
cruelly
;
could
you
know
half
the
*NL*
torments
which
I
feel
,
that
tender
bosom
must
pity
what
those
eyes
*NL*
have
caused
.
''
Then
fetching
a
deep
sigh
,
and
laying
hold
of
her
hand
,
*NL*
he
ran
on
for
some
minutes
in
a
strain
which
would
be
little
more
*NL*
pleasing
to
the
reader
than
it
was
to
the
lady
;
and
at
last
concluded
*NL*
with
a
declaration
,
``
That
if
he
was
master
of
the
world
,
he
would
lay
*NL*
it
at
her
feet
.
''
Sophia
then
,
forcibly
pulling
away
her
hand
from
his
,
*NL*
answered
with
much
spirit
,
``
I
promise
you
,
sir
,
your
world
and
its
*NL*
master
I
should
spurn
from
me
with
equal
contempt
.
''
She
then
offered
*NL*
to
go
;
and
Lord
Fellamar
,
again
laying
hold
of
her
hand
,
said
,
``
Pardon
*NL*
me
,
my
beloved
angel
,
freedoms
which
nothing
but
despair
could
have
*NL*
tempted
me
to
take
.
--
Believe
me
,
could
I
have
had
any
hope
that
my
*NL*
title
and
fortune
,
neither
of
them
inconsiderable
,
unless
when
*NL*
compared
with
your
worth
,
would
have
been
accepted
,
I
had
,
in
the
*NL*
humblest
manner
,
presented
them
to
your
acceptance
.
--
But
I
can
not
*NL*
lose
you
.
--
By
heaven
,
I
will
sooner
part
with
my
soul
!
--
You
are
,
you
*NL*
must
,
you
shall
be
only
mine
.
''
``
My
lord
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
intreat
you
to
*NL*
desist
from
a
vain
pursuit
;
for
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
will
never
hear
you
*NL*
on
this
subject
.
Let
go
my
hand
,
my
lord
;
for
I
am
resolved
to
go
from
*NL*
you
this
moment
;
nor
will
I
ever
see
you
more
.
''
``
Then
,
madam
,
''
cries
*NL*
his
lordship
,
``
I
must
make
the
best
use
of
this
moment
;
for
I
can
not
*NL*
live
,
nor
will
I
live
without
you
.
''
--
``
What
do
you
mean
,
my
lord
?
''
*NL*
said
Sophia
;
``
I
will
raise
the
family
.
''
``
I
have
no
fear
,
madam
,
''
*NL*
answered
he
,
``
but
of
losing
you
,
and
that
I
am
resolved
to
prevent
,
*NL*
the
only
way
which
despair
points
to
me
.
''
--
He
then
caught
her
in
his
*NL*
arms
:
upon
which
she
screamed
so
loud
,
that
she
must
have
alarmed
some
*NL*
one
to
her
assistance
,
had
not
Lady
Bellaston
taken
care
to
remove
all
*NL*
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
more
lucky
circumstance
happened
for
poor
Sophia
;
another
noise
*NL*
now
broke
forth
,
which
almost
drowned
her
cries
;
for
now
the
whole
*NL*
house
rang
with
,
``
Where
is
she
?
D
--
n
me
,
I
'll
unkennel
her
this
*NL*
instant
.
Show
me
her
chamber
,
I
say
.
Where
is
my
daughter
?
I
know
*NL*
she
's
in
the
house
,
and
I
'll
see
her
if
she
's
above-ground
.
Show
me
*NL*
where
she
is
.
''
--
At
which
last
words
the
door
flew
open
,
and
in
came
*NL*
Squire
Western
,
with
his
parson
and
a
set
of
myrmidons
at
his
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
miserable
must
have
been
the
condition
of
poor
Sophia
,
when
the
*NL*
enraged
voice
of
her
father
was
welcome
to
her
ears
!
Welcome
indeed
it
*NL*
was
,
and
luckily
did
he
come
;
for
it
was
the
only
accident
upon
earth
*NL*
which
could
have
preserved
the
peace
of
her
mind
from
being
for
ever
*NL*
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
notwithstanding
her
fright
,
presently
knew
her
father
's
voice
;
*NL*
and
his
lordship
,
notwithstanding
his
passion
,
knew
the
voice
of
*NL*
reason
,
which
peremptorily
assured
him
,
it
was
not
now
a
time
for
the
*NL*
perpetration
of
his
villany
.
Hearing
,
therefore
,
the
voice
approach
,
*NL*
and
hearing
likewise
whose
it
was
-LRB-
for
as
the
squire
more
than
once
*NL*
roared
forth
the
word
daughter
,
so
Sophia
,
in
the
midst
of
her
*NL*
struggling
,
cried
out
upon
her
father
-RRB-
,
he
thought
proper
to
*NL*
relinquish
his
prey
,
having
only
disordered
her
handkerchief
,
and
with
*NL*
his
rude
lips
committed
violence
on
her
lovely
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
reader
's
imagination
doth
not
assist
me
,
I
shall
never
be
able
*NL*
to
describe
the
situation
of
these
two
persons
when
Western
came
into
*NL*
the
room
.
Sophia
tottered
into
a
chair
,
where
she
sat
disordered
,
*NL*
pale
,
breathless
,
bursting
with
indignation
at
Lord
Fellamar
;
*NL*
affrighted
,
and
yet
more
rejoiced
,
at
the
arrival
of
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
lordship
sat
down
near
her
,
with
the
bag
of
his
wig
hanging
over
*NL*
one
of
his
shoulders
,
the
rest
of
his
dress
being
somewhat
disordered
,
*NL*
and
rather
a
greater
proportion
of
linen
than
is
usual
appearing
at
*NL*
his
bosom
.
As
to
the
rest
,
he
was
amazed
,
affrighted
,
vexed
,
and
*NL*
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Squire
Western
,
he
happened
at
this
time
to
be
overtaken
by
an
*NL*
enemy
,
which
very
frequently
pursues
,
and
seldom
fails
to
overtake
,
*NL*
most
of
the
country
gentlemen
in
this
kingdom
.
He
was
,
literally
*NL*
speaking
,
drunk
;
which
circumstance
,
together
with
his
natural
*NL*
impetuosity
,
could
produce
no
other
effect
than
his
running
*NL*
immediately
up
to
his
daughter
,
upon
whom
he
fell
foul
with
his
tongue
*NL*
in
the
most
inveterate
manner
;
nay
,
he
had
probably
committed
violence
*NL*
with
his
hands
,
had
not
the
parson
interposed
,
saying
,
``
For
heaven
's
*NL*
sake
,
sir
,
animadvert
that
you
are
in
the
house
of
a
great
lady
.
Let
*NL*
me
beg
you
to
mitigate
your
wrath
;
it
should
minister
a
fulness
of
*NL*
satisfaction
that
you
have
found
your
daughter
;
for
as
to
revenge
,
it
*NL*
belongeth
not
unto
us
.
I
discern
great
contrition
in
the
countenance
*NL*
of
the
young
lady
.
I
stand
assured
,
if
you
will
forgive
her
,
she
will
*NL*
repent
her
of
all
past
offences
,
and
return
unto
her
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
strength
of
the
parson
's
arms
had
at
first
been
of
more
service
*NL*
than
the
strength
of
his
rhetoric
.
However
,
his
last
words
wrought
*NL*
some
effect
,
and
the
squire
answered
,
``
I
'll
forgee
her
if
she
wull
ha
*NL*
un

If

stubborn

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
intreat
you
,
sir
,
to
be
a
little
more
moderate
,
''
said
the
*NL*
parson
;
``
you
frighten
the
young
lady
so
,
that
you
deprive
her
of
all
*NL*
power
of
utterance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Power
of
mine

answered
the
squire
.
``
You
take
her
part

*NL*

A

Yes

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
humbly
crave
your
pardon
,
''
said
the
parson
;
``
I
assure
your
worship
*NL*
I
meant
no
such
matter

''
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lady
Bellaston
now
entered
the
room
,
and
came
up
to
the
squire
,
who
*NL*
no
sooner
saw
her
,
than
,
resolving
to
follow
the
instructions
of
his
*NL*
sister
,
he
made
her
a
very
civil
bow
,
in
the
rural
manner
,
and
paid
*NL*
her
some
of
his
best
compliments
.
He
then
immediately
proceeded
to
his
*NL*
complaints
,
and
said
,
``
There
,
my
lady
cousin
;
there
stands
the
most
*NL*
undutiful
child
in
the
world
;
she
hankers
after
a
beggarly
rascal
,
and
*NL*
wo
n't
marry
one
of
the
greatest
matches
in
all
England
,
that
we
have
*NL*
provided
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

Western

answered
the
lady
,
``
I
am
persuaded
you
wrong
*NL*
my

I
am

a
better
understanding

I

*NL*
she
will
not
refuse
what
she
must
be
sensible

so
much
to
her
*NL*
advantage

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
wilful
mistake
in
Lady
Bellaston
,
for
she
well
knew
whom
Mr
*NL*
Western
meant
;
though
perhaps
she
thought
he
would
easily
be
*NL*
reconciled
to
his
lordship
's
proposals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear

quoth
the
squire
,
``
what
her

*NL*

said
the

said
Lady
Bellaston
,

*NL*

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
give
him
your

said
the
lady
.
``
It
is
the
fashion
*NL*
now-a-days
to
dispense

time
and
long
courtships

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
squire
,
``
what

wo

they
have

well
after

*NL*
*NL*
As
Lord
Fellamar
was
very
well
assured
that
he
was
meant
by
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
,
so
,
never
having
heard
nor
suspected
a
word
of
Blifil
,
he
*NL*
made
no
doubt
of
his
being
meant
by
the
father
.
Coming
up
,
therefore
,
*NL*
to
the
squire
,
he
said
,
``
Though
I
have
not
the
honour

*NL*

His

was
no

gone

Lady
Bellaston
,
coming
up
to
Mr

Western
,
said
,
``

yesterday
made

you
must
accept

the
highest
pleasure

*NL*
``

Lady
Bellaston
made
a
civil
speech
upon
the
word
trouble
;
*NL*
to
which
the
squire
answered

``
Why

*NL*
Sophia
said
she
would
attend
him
without
force
;
but
begged
to
go
in
a
*NL*
chair
,
for
she
said
she
should
not
be
able
to
ride
any
other
way

the

Sophia
told
him

she
saw

break

He
then
took
violent
hold
of
her
hand

upon

the
*NL*
parson
once
more
interfered

begging
him
to
use
gentle
methods

At

that
the
squire
thundered
out
a

the

hold

Mrs
Honour
appeared
below-stairs
,
and
with
a
low
curtesy
to
the
squire
*NL*
offered
to
attend
her
mistress
;
but
he
pushed
her
away
,
saying
,
``
Hold

madam

hold

you
come
no

near

And
will
you

said
Sophia

``
Yes

indeed

will

cries
*NL*
the
squire
:
``
you
need
not
fear
being

get
you

He
then
packed
up
his
*NL*
daughter
and
the
parson
into
the
hackney
coach
,
after
which
he
mounted
*NL*
himself
,
and
ordered
it
to
drive
to
his
lodgings
.
In
the
way
thither
*NL*
he
suffered
Sophia
to
be
quiet
,
and
entertained
himself
with
reading
a
*NL*
lecture
to
the
parson
on
good
manners
,
and
a
proper
behaviour
to
his
*NL*
betters

*NL*
*NL*
It
is
possible
he
might
not
so
easily
have
carried
off
his
daughter

from
Lady
Bellaston

had
that
good
lady
desired
to
have
detained
her
;
*NL*
but
,
in
reality
,
she
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
confinement
*NL*
into
which
Sophia
was
going
;
and
as
her
project
with
Lord
Fellamar
had
*NL*
failed
of
success
,
she
was
well
contented
that
other
violent
methods

going

used

By
what
means
the
squire
came
to
discover
his
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
reader
,
in
many
histories
,
is
obliged
to
digest
much
more
*NL*
unaccountable
appearances
than
this
of
Mr

without
any

satisfaction
at

as
we
dearly
love

we
shall
now
proceed
to
shew
by

method
the

discovered
where
his

was

In
the

of

we
gave
a
hint

for
*NL*
it
is
not
our
custom
to
unfold
at
any

more
than
is
necessary
for

the
occasion
-RRB-
that
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
who
was
very
desirous
of
*NL*
reconciling
her
uncle
and
aunt
Western
,
thought
she
had
a
probable
*NL*
opportunity
,
by
the
service
of
preserving
Sophia
from
committing
the
*NL*
same
crime
which
had
drawn
on
herself
the
anger
of
her
family
.
After
*NL*
much
deliberation
,
therefore
,
she
resolved
to
inform
her
aunt
Western
*NL*
where
her
cousin
was
,
and
accordingly
she
writ
the
following
letter
,
*NL*
which
we
shall
give
the
reader
at
length
,
for
more
reasons
than
one
.

*NL*
``
HONOURED
MADAM
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
occasion
of
my
writing
this
will
perhaps
make
a
letter
of
mine
*NL*
agreeable
to
my
dear
aunt
,
for
the
sake
of
one
of
her
nieces
,
though
*NL*
I
have
little
reason
to
hope
it
will
be
so
on
the
account
of
*NL*
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
more
apology
,
as
I
was
coming
to
throw
my
unhappy
self
at
*NL*
your
feet
,
I
met
,
by
the
strangest
accident
in
the
world
,
my
cousin
*NL*
Sophy
,
whose
history
you
are
better
acquainted
with
than
myself
,
*NL*
though
,
alas
!
I
know
infinitely
too
much
;
enough
indeed
to
satisfy
*NL*
me
,
that
unless
she
is
immediately
prevented
,
she
is
in
danger
of
*NL*
running
into
the
same
fatal
mischief
,
which
,
by
foolishly
and
*NL*
ignorantly
refusing
your
most
wise
and
prudent
advice
,
I
have
*NL*
unfortunately
brought
on
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
short
,
I
have
seen
the
man
,
nay
,
I
was
most
part
of
yesterday
in
*NL*
his
company
,
and
a
charming
young
fellow
I
promise
you
he
is
.
By
*NL*
what
accident
he
came
acquainted
with
me
is
too
tedious
to
tell
you
*NL*
now
;
but
I
have
this
morning
changed
my
lodgings
to
avoid
him
,
lest
*NL*
he
should
by
my
means
discover
my
cousin
;
for
he
doth
not
yet
know
*NL*
where
she
is
,
and
it
is
adviseable
he
should
not
,
till
my
uncle
hath
*NL*
secured
her
.
--
No
time
therefore
is
to
be
lost
;
and
I
need
only
*NL*
inform
you
,
that
she
is
now
with
Lady
Bellaston
,
whom
I
have
seen
,
*NL*
and
who
hath
,
I
find
,
a
design
of
concealing
her
from
her
family
.
*NL*
You
know
,
madam
,
she
is
a
strange
woman
;
but
nothing
could
misbecome
*NL*
me
more
than
to
presume
to
give
any
hint
to
one
of
your
great
*NL*
understanding
and
great
knowledge
of
the
world
,
besides
barely
*NL*
informing
you
of
the
matter
of
fact

I
hope
,
madam

the
care
which
I
have
shewn
on
this
occasion
for
the
*NL*
good
of

will
recommend
me
again
to
the
favour
of
a
lady
*NL*
who
hath
always
exerted
so
much
zeal
for
the
honour

true

it
may
be
a

Mrs
Western
was
now
at
her
brother
's
house
,
where
she
had
resided
ever
*NL*
since
the
flight
of
Sophia
,
in
order
to
administer
comfort
to
the
poor
*NL*
squire
in
his
affliction
.
Of
this
comfort
,
which
she
doled
out
to
him
*NL*
in
daily
portions
,
we
have
formerly
given
a
specimen
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
now
standing
with
her
back
to
the
fire
,
and
,
with
a
pinch
of
*NL*
snuff
in
her
hand
,
was
dealing
forth
this
daily
allowance
of
comfort
*NL*
to
the
squire
,
while
he
smoaked
his
afternoon
pipe
,
when
she
received
*NL*
the
above
letter
;
which
she
had
no
sooner
read
than
she
delivered
it
*NL*
to
him
,
saying
,
``
There
,
sir
,
there
is
an
account
of
your
lost
sheep
.
*NL*
Fortune
hath
again
restored
her
to
you
,
and
if
you
will
be
governed
by
*NL*
my
advice
,
it
is
possible
you
may
yet
preserve
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
had
no
sooner
read
the
letter
than
he
leaped
from
his
*NL*
chair
,
threw
his
pipe
into
the
fire
,
and
gave
a
loud
huzza
for
joy
.
He
*NL*
then
summoned
his
servants
,
called
for
his
boots
,
and
ordered
the
*NL*
Chevalier
and
several
other
horses
to
be
saddled
,
and
that
parson
*NL*
Supple
should
be
immediately
sent
for
.
Having
done
this
,
he
turned
to
*NL*
his
sister
,
caught
her
in
his
arms
,
and
gave
her
a
close
embrace
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
Zounds
!
you
do
n't
seem
pleased

one
would
imagine

what

swims
on

It

true

indeed

things
do
look
rather

they
did
formerly
in

when
Lewis

you
will
pardon
me

a
decorum
to

words
Jones
turned
pale

on

said
Honour
:
``
Why
,
the
worst
that
could
have
happened
*NL*
both
for
you
and
for
me
.
--
Her
father
is
come
to
town
,
and
hath
carried
*NL*
her
away
from
us
both
.
''
Here
Jones
fell
on
his
knees
in
thanksgiving
*NL*
that
it
was
no
worse
.
``
No
worse
!
''
repeated
Honour
;
``
what
could
be
*NL*
worse
for
either
of
us
?
He
carried
her
off
,
swearing
she
should
marry
*NL*
Mr
Blifil
;
that
's
for
your
comfort
;
and
,
for
poor
me
,
I
am
turned
out
*NL*
of
doors
.
''
``
Indeed
,
Mrs
Honour
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
you
frightened
me
*NL*
out
of
my
wits
.
I
imagined
some
most
dreadful
sudden
accident
had
*NL*
happened
to
Sophia
;
something
,
compared
to
which
,
even
seeing
her
*NL*
married
to
Blifil
would
be
a
trifle
;
but
while
there
is
life
there
are
*NL*
hopes
,
my
dear
Honour
.
Women
in
this
land
of
liberty
,
can
not
be
*NL*
married
by
actual
brutal
force
.
''
``
To
be
sure
,
sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
that
's
*NL*
true
.
There
may
be
some
hopes
for
you
;
but
alack-a-day
!
what
hopes
are
*NL*
there
for
poor
me
?
And
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
you
must
be
sensible
I
suffer
*NL*
all
this
upon
your
account
.
All
the
quarrel
the
squire
hath
to
me
is
*NL*
for
taking
your
part
,
as
I
have
done
,
against
Mr
Blifil
.
''
``
Indeed
,
Mrs
*NL*
Honour
,
''
answered
he
,
``
I
am
sensible
of
my
obligations
to
you
,
and
*NL*
will
leave
nothing
in
my
power
undone
to
make
you
amends
.
''
``
Alas
!
*NL*
sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
what
can
make
a
servant
amends
for
the
loss
of
one
*NL*
place
but
the
getting
another
altogether
as
good
?
''
``
Do
not
despair
,
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
I
hope
to
reinstate
you
again
in
the
same
.
''
*NL*
``
Alack-a-day
,
sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
how
can
I
flatter
myself
with
such
*NL*
hopes
when
I
know
it
is
a
thing
impossible
?
for
the
squire
is
so
set
*NL*
against
me
:
and
yet
,
if
you
should
ever
have
my
lady
,
as
to
be
sure
I
*NL*
now
hopes
heartily
you
will
;
for
you
are
a
generous
,
good-natured
*NL*
gentleman
;
and
I
am
sure
you
loves
her
,
and
to
be
sure
she
loves
you
*NL*
as
dearly
as
her
own
soul
;
it
is
a
matter
in
vain
to
deny
it
;
because
*NL*
as
why
,
everybody
,
that
is
in
the
least
acquainted
with
my
lady
,
must
*NL*
see
it
;
for
,
poor
dear
lady
,
she
ca
n't
dissemble
:
and
if
two
people
*NL*
who
loves
one
another
a
'n'
t
happy
,
why
who
should
be
so
?
Happiness
*NL*
do
n't
always
depend
upon
what
people
has
;
besides
,
my
lady
has
enough
*NL*
for
both
.
To
be
sure
,
therefore
,
as
one
may
say
,
it
would
be
all
the
*NL*
pity
in
the
world
to
keep
two
such
loviers
asunder
;
nay
,
I
am
*NL*
convinced
,
for
my
part
,
you
will
meet
together
at
last
;
for
,
if
it
is
*NL*
to
be
,
there
is
no
preventing
it
.
If
a
marriage
is
made
in
heaven
,
all
*NL*
the
justices
of
peace
upon
earth
ca
n't
break
it
off
.
To
be
sure
I
*NL*
wishes
that
parson
Supple
had
but
a
little
more
spirit
,
to
tell
the
*NL*
squire
of
his
wickedness
in
endeavouring
to
force
his
daughter
*NL*
contrary
to
her
liking
;
but
then
his
whole
dependance
is
on
the
*NL*
squire
;
and
so
the
poor
gentleman
,
though
he
is
a
very
religious
good
*NL*
sort
of
man
,
and
talks
of
the
badness
of
such
doings
behind
the
*NL*
squire
's
back
,
yet
he
dares
not
say
his
soul
is
his
own
to
his
face
.
*NL*
To
be
sure
I
never
saw
him
make
so
bold
as
just
now
;
I
was
afeard
the
*NL*
squire
would
have
struck
him
.
I
would
not
have
your
honour
be
*NL*
melancholy
,
sir
,
nor
despair
;
things
may
go
better
,
as
long
as
you
are
*NL*
sure
of
my
lady
,
and
that
I
am
certain
you
may
be
;
for
she
never
will
*NL*
be
brought
to
consent
to
marry
any
other
man
.
Indeed
I
am
terribly
*NL*
afeared
the
squire
will
do
her
a
mischief
in
his
passion
,
for
he
is
a
*NL*
prodigious
passionate
gentleman
;
and
I
am
afeared
too
the
poor
lady
*NL*
will
be
brought
to
break
her
heart
,
for
she
is
as
tender-hearted
as
a
*NL*
chicken
.
It
is
pity
,
methinks
,
she
had
not
a
little
of
my
courage
.
If
*NL*
I
was
in
love
with
a
young
man
,
and
my
father
offered
to
lock
me
up
,
*NL*
I
'd
tear
his
eyes
out
but
I
'd
come
at
him
;
but
then
there
's
a
great
*NL*
fortune
in
the
case
,
which
it
is
in
her
father
's
power
either
to
give
*NL*
her
or
not
;
that
,
to
be
sure
,
may
make
some
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Jones
gave
strict
attention
to
all
the
foregoing
harangue
,
or
*NL*
whether
it
was
for
want
of
any
vacancy
in
the
discourse
,
I
can
not
*NL*
determine
;
but
he
never
once
attempted
to
answer
,
nor
did
she
once
*NL*
stop
till
Partridge
came
running
into
the
room
,
and
informed
him
that
*NL*
the
great
lady
was
upon
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
equal
the
dilemma
to
which
Jones
was
now
reduced
.
Honour
*NL*
knew
nothing
of
any
acquaintance
that
subsisted
between
him
and
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
,
and
she
was
almost
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
whom
he
*NL*
would
have
communicated
it
.
In
this
hurry
and
distress
,
he
took
-LRB-
as
is
*NL*
common
enough
-RRB-
the
worst
course
,
and
,
instead
of
exposing
her
to
the
*NL*
lady
,
which
would
have
been
of
little
consequence
,
he
chose
to
expose
*NL*
the
lady
to
her
;
he
therefore
resolved
to
hide
Honour
,
whom
he
had
but
*NL*
just
time
to
convey
behind
the
bed
,
and
to
draw
the
curtains
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hurry
in
which
Jones
had
been
all
day
engaged
on
account
of
his
*NL*
poor
landlady
and
her
family
,
the
terrors
occasioned
by
Mrs
Honour
,
*NL*
and
the
confusion
into
which
he
was
thrown
by
the
sudden
arrival
of
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
,
had
altogether
driven
former
thoughts
out
of
his
head
;
*NL*
so
that
it
never
once
occurred
to
his
memory
to
act
the
part
of
a
sick
*NL*
man
;
which
,
indeed
,
neither
the
gaiety
of
his
dress
,
nor
the
freshness
*NL*
of
his
countenance
,
would
have
at
all
supported
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
received
her
ladyship
therefore
rather
agreeably
to
her
desires
*NL*
than
to
her
expectations
,
with
all
the
good
humour
he
could
muster
in
*NL*
his
countenance
,
and
without
any
real
or
affected
appearance
of
the
*NL*
least
disorder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
no
sooner
entered
the
room
,
than
she
squatted
herself
*NL*
down
on
the
bed
:
``
So
,
my
dear
Jones
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
find
nothing
can
*NL*
detain
me
long
from
you
.
Perhaps
I
ought
to
be
angry
with
you
,
that
I
*NL*
have
neither
seen
nor
heard
from
you
all
day
;
for
I
perceive
your
*NL*
distemper
would
have
suffered
you
to
come
abroad
:
nay
,
I
suppose
you
*NL*
have
not
sat
in
your
chamber
all
day
drest
up
like
a
fine
lady
to
see
*NL*
company
after
a
lying-in
;
but
,
however
,
do
n't
think
I
intend
to
scold
*NL*
you
;
for
I
never
will
give
you
an
excuse
for
the
cold
behaviour
of
a
*NL*
husband
,
by
putting
on
the
ill-humour
of
a
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
Lady
Bellaston
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
I
am
sure
your
ladyship
will
not
*NL*
upbraid
me
with
neglect
of
duty
,
when
I
only
waited
for
orders
.
Who
,
*NL*
my
dear
creature
,
hath
reason
to
complain
?
Who
missed
an
appointment
*NL*
last
night
,
and
left
an
unhappy
man
to
expect
,
and
wish
,
and
sigh
,
and
*NL*
languish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
mention
it
,
my
dear
Mr
Jones
,
''
cried
she
.
``
If
you
knew
the
*NL*
occasion
,
you
would
pity
me
.
In
short
,
it
is
impossible
to
conceive
*NL*
what
women
of
condition
are
obliged
to
suffer
from
the
impertinence
of
*NL*
fools
,
in
order
to
keep
up
the
farce
of
the
world
.
I
am
glad
,
however
,
*NL*
all
your
languishing
and
wishing
have
done
you
no
harm
;
for
you
never
*NL*
looked
better
in
your
life
.
Upon
my
faith
!
Jones
,
you
might
at
this
*NL*
instant
sit
for
the
picture
of
Adonis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
certain
words
of
provocation
which
men
of
honour
hold
can
*NL*
properly
be
answered
only
by
a
blow
.
Among
lovers
possibly
there
may
*NL*
be
some
expressions
which
can
be
answered
only
by
a
kiss
.
Now
the
*NL*
compliment
which
Lady
Bellaston
now
made
Jones
seems
to
be
of
this
*NL*
kind
,
especially
as
it
was
attended
with
a
look
,
in
which
the
lady
*NL*
conveyed
more
soft
ideas
than
it
was
possible
to
express
with
her
*NL*
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
certainly
at
this
instant
in
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
*NL*
and
distressed
situations
imaginable
;
for
,
to
carry
on
the
comparison
*NL*
we
made
use
of
before
,
though
the
provocation
was
given
by
the
lady
,
*NL*
Jones
could
not
receive
satisfaction
,
nor
so
much
as
offer
to
ask
it
,
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
a
third
person
;
seconds
in
this
kind
of
duels
not
*NL*
being
according
to
the
law
of
arms
.
As
this
objection
did
not
occur
to
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
was
ignorant
of
any
other
woman
being
there
but
*NL*
herself
,
she
waited
some
time
in
great
astonishment
for
an
answer
from
*NL*
Jones
,
who
,
conscious
of
the
ridiculous
figure
he
made
,
stood
at
a
*NL*
distance
,
and
,
not
daring
to
give
the
proper
answer
,
gave
none
at
all
.
*NL*
Nothing
can
be
imagined
more
comic
,
nor
yet
more
tragical
,
than
this
*NL*
scene
would
have
been
if
it
had
lasted
much
longer
.
The
lady
had
*NL*
already
changed
colour
two
or
three
times
;
had
got
up
from
the
bed
and
*NL*
sat
down
again
,
while
Jones
was
wishing
the
ground
to
sink
under
him
,
*NL*
or
the
house
to
fall
on
his
head
,
when
an
odd
accident
freed
him
from
*NL*
an
embarrassment
out
of
which
neither
the
eloquence
of
a
Cicero
,
nor
*NL*
the
politics
of
a
Machiavel
,
could
have
delivered
him
,
without
utter
*NL*
disgrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
no
other
than
the
arrival
of
young
Nightingale
,
dead
drunk
;
*NL*
or
rather
in
that
state
of
drunkenness
which
deprives
men
of
the
use
*NL*
of
their
reason
without
depriving
them
of
the
use
of
their
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
and
her
daughters
were
in
bed
,
and
Partridge
was
smoaking
*NL*
his
pipe
by
the
kitchen
fire
;
so
that
he
arrived
at
Mr
Jones
's
*NL*
chamber-door
without
any
interruption
.
This
he
burst
open
,
and
was
*NL*
entering
without
any
ceremony
,
when
Jones
started
from
his
seat
and
*NL*
ran
to
oppose
him
,
which
he
did
so
effectually
,
that
Nightingale
never
*NL*
came
far
enough
within
the
door
to
see
who
was
sitting
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nightingale
had
in
reality
mistaken
Jones
's
apartment
for
that
in
*NL*
which
himself
had
lodged
;
he
therefore
strongly
insisted
on
coming
in
,
*NL*
often
swearing
that
he
would
not
be
kept
from
his
own
bed
.
Jones
,
*NL*
however
,
prevailed
over
him
,
and
delivered
him
into
the
hands
of
*NL*
Partridge
,
whom
the
noise
on
the
stairs
soon
summoned
to
his
master
's
*NL*
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
Jones
was
unwillingly
obliged
to
return
to
his
own
apartment
,
*NL*
where
at
the
very
instant
of
his
entrance
he
heard
Lady
Bellaston
*NL*
venting
an
exclamation
,
though
not
a
very
loud
one
;
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
saw
her
flinging
herself
into
a
chair
in
a
vast
agitation
,
which
*NL*
in
a
lady
of
a
tender
constitution
would
have
been
an
hysteric
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
reality
the
lady
,
frightened
with
the
struggle
between
the
two
men
,
*NL*
of
which
she
did
not
know
what
would
be
the
issue
,
as
she
heard
*NL*
Nightingale
swear
many
oaths
he
would
come
to
his
own
bed
,
attempted
*NL*
to
retire
to
her
known
place
of
hiding
,
which
to
her
great
confusion
*NL*
she
found
already
occupied
by
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
usage
to
be
borne
,
Mr
Jones
?
''
cries
the
lady
.
--
``
Basest
of
*NL*
men
?
--
What
wretch
is
this
to
whom
you
have
exposed
me
?
''
``
Wretch
!
''
*NL*
cries
Honour
,
bursting
in
a
violent
rage
from
her
place
of
*NL*
concealment
--
``
Marry
come
up
!
--
Wretch
forsooth
?
--
as
poor
a
wretch
*NL*
as
I
am
,
I
am
honest
;
this
is
more
than
some
folks
who
are
richer
can
*NL*
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
instead
of
applying
himself
directly
to
take
off
the
edge
of
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
's
resentment
,
as
a
more
experienced
gallant
would
have
*NL*
done
,
fell
to
cursing
his
stars
,
and
lamenting
himself
as
the
most
*NL*
unfortunate
man
in
the
world
;
and
presently
after
,
addressing
himself
*NL*
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
he
fell
to
some
very
absurd
protestations
of
*NL*
innocence
.
By
this
time
the
lady
,
having
recovered
the
use
of
her
*NL*
reason
,
which
she
had
as
ready
as
any
woman
in
the
world
,
especially
*NL*
on
such
occasions
,
calmly
replied
:
``
Sir
,
you
need
make
no
apologies
,
I
*NL*
see
now
who
the
person
is
;
I
did
not
at
first
know
Mrs
Honour
:
but
now
*NL*
I
do
,
I
can
suspect
nothing
wrong
between
her
and
you
;
and
I
am
sure
*NL*
she
is
a

it
may
be
in
my
*NL*
power
to
be
much
more
hereafter

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Honour
was
altogether
as
placable
as
she
was
passionate
.
Hearing
,
*NL*
therefore
,
Lady
Bellaston
assume
the
soft
tone
,
she
likewise
softened
*NL*
hers
.
--
``
I
'm
sure
,
madam
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
have
been
always
ready
to
*NL*
acknowledge
your
ladyship
's
friendships
to
me
;
sure
I
never
had
so
*NL*
good
a
friend
as
your
ladyship
--
and
to
be
sure
,
now
I
see
it
is
your
*NL*
ladyship
that
I
spoke
to

I
could
almost
bite
my
tongue
off

very
*NL*
mad

to
be

become

as
I
am
to
think
about
such
a
great
lady

I
mean
I
*NL*
was
a
servant
:
for
indeed
I
am
nobody
's
servant
now
,
the
more
*NL*
miserable
wretch
is
me
.
--
I
have
lost
the
best
mistress
--
''
Here
*NL*
Honour
thought
fit
to
produce
a
shower
of
tears
.
--
``
Do
n't
cry
,
child
,
''
*NL*
says
the
good
lady
;
``
ways
perhaps
may
be
found
to
make
you
amends
.
*NL*
Come
to
me
to-morrow
morning
.
''
She
then
took
up
her
fan
which
lay
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
without
even
looking
at
Jones
walked
very
majestically
*NL*
out
of
the
room
;
there
being
a
kind
of
dignity
in
the
impudence
of
*NL*
women
of
quality
,
which
their
inferiors
vainly
aspire
to
attain
to
in
*NL*
circumstances
of
this
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
followed
her
downstairs
,
often
offering
her
his
hand
,
which
she
*NL*
absolutely
refused
him
,
and
got
into
her
chair
without
taking
any
*NL*
notice
of
him
as
he
stood
bowing
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
return
upstairs
,
a
long
dialogue
past
between
him
and
Mrs
*NL*
Honour
,
while
she
was
adjusting
herself
after
the
discomposure
she
had
*NL*
undergone
.
The
subject
of
this
was
his
infidelity
to
her
young
lady
;
*NL*
on
which
she
enlarged
with
great
bitterness
;
but
Jones
at
last
found
*NL*
means
to
reconcile
her
,
and
not
only
so
,
but
to
obtain
a
promise
of
*NL*
most
inviolable
secrecy
,
and
that
she
would
the
next
morning
endeavour
*NL*
to
find
out
Sophia
,
and
bring
him
a
further
account
of
the
proceedings
*NL*
of
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
this
unfortunate
adventure
to
the
satisfaction
only
of
Mrs
*NL*
Honour
;
for
a
secret
-LRB-
as
some
of
my
readers
will
perhaps
acknowledge
*NL*
from
experience
-RRB-
is
often
a
very
valuable
possession
:
and
that
not
*NL*
only
to
those
who
faithfully
keep
it
,
but
sometimes
to
such
as
whisper
*NL*
it
about
till
it
come
to
the
ears
of
every
one
except
the
ignorant
*NL*
person
who
pays
for
the
supposed
concealing
of
what
is
publickly
*NL*
known

Notwithstanding
all
the
obligations
she
had
received
from
Jones
,
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
could
not
forbear
in
the
morning
some
gentle
remonstrances
for
*NL*
the
hurricane
which
had
happened
the
preceding
night
in
his
chamber
.
*NL*
These
were
,
however
,
so
gentle
and
so
friendly
,
professing
,
and
indeed
*NL*
truly
,
to
aim
at
nothing
more
than
the
real
good
of
Mr
Jones
himself
,
*NL*
that
he
,
far
from
being
offended
,
thankfully
received
the
admonition
*NL*
of
the
good
woman
,
expressed
much
concern
for
what
had
past
,
excused
*NL*
it
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
promised
never
more
to
bring
the
same
*NL*
disturbances
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
Mrs
Miller
did
not
refrain
from
a
short
expostulation
in
*NL*
private
at
their
first
meeting
,
yet
the
occasion
of
his
being
summoned
*NL*
downstairs
that
morning
was
of
a
much
more
agreeable
kind
,
being
*NL*
indeed
to
perform
the
office
of
a
father
to
Miss
Nancy
,
and
to
give
*NL*
her
in
wedlock
to
Mr
Nightingale
,
who
was
now
ready
drest
,
and
full
as
*NL*
sober
as
many
of
my
readers
will
think
a
man
ought
to
be
who
receives
*NL*
a
wife
in
so
imprudent
a
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
perhaps
it
may
be
proper
to
account
for
the
escape
which
this
*NL*
young
gentleman
had
made
from
his
uncle
,
and
for
his
appearance
in
the
*NL*
condition
in
which
we
have
seen
him
the
night
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
when
the
uncle
had
arrived
at
his
lodgings
with
his
nephew
,
partly
*NL*
to
indulge
his
own
inclinations
-LRB-
for
he
dearly
loved
his
bottle
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
partly
to
disqualify
his
nephew
from
the
immediate
execution
of
his
*NL*
purpose
,
he
ordered
wine
to
be
set
on
the
table
;
with
which
he
so
*NL*
briskly
plyed
the
young
gentleman
,
that
this
latter
,
who
,
though
not
*NL*
much
used
to
drinking
,
did
not
detest
it
so
as
to
be
guilty
of
*NL*
disobedience
or
want
of
complacence
by
refusing
,
was
soon
completely
*NL*
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
the
uncle
had
obtained
this
victory
,
and
was
preparing
a
bed
*NL*
for
his
nephew
,
a
messenger
arrived
with
a
piece
of
news
,
which
so
*NL*
entirely
disconcerted
and
shocked
him
,
that
he
in
a
moment
lost
all
*NL*
consideration
for
his
nephew
,
and
his
whole
mind
became
entirely
taken
*NL*
up
with
his
own
concerns
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sudden
and
afflicting
news
was
no
less
than
that
his
daughter
had
*NL*
taken
the
opportunity
of
almost
the
first
moment
of
his
absence
,
and
*NL*
had
gone
off
with
a
neighbouring
young
clergyman
;
against
whom
,
though
*NL*
her
father
could
have
had
but
one
objection
,
namely
,
that
he
was
worth
*NL*
nothing
,
yet
she
had
never
thought
proper
to
communicate
her
amour
*NL*
even
to
that
father
;
and
so
artfully
had
she
managed
,
that
it
had
*NL*
never
been
once
suspected
by
any
,
till
now
that
it
was
consummated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Mr
Nightingale
no
sooner
received
this
account
,
than
in
the
utmost
*NL*
confusion
he
ordered
a
post-chaise
to
be
instantly
got
ready
,
and
,
*NL*
having
recommended
his
nephew
to
the
care
of
a
servant
,
he
directly
*NL*
left
the
house
,
scarce
knowing
what
he
did
,
nor
whither
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
uncle
thus
departed
,
when
the
servant
came
to
attend
the
nephew
to
*NL*
bed
,
had
waked
him
for
that
purpose
,
and
had
at
last
made
him
sensible
*NL*
that
his
uncle
was
gone
,
he
,
instead
of
accepting
the
kind
offices
*NL*
tendered
him
,
insisted
on
a
chair
being
called
;
with
this
the
servant
,
*NL*
who
had
received
no
strict
orders
to
the
contrary
,
readily
complied
;
*NL*
and
,
thus
being
conducted
back
to
the
house
of
Mrs
Miller
,
he
had
*NL*
staggered
up
to
Mr
Jones
's
chamber
,
as
hath
been
before
recounted
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
bar
of
the
uncle
being
now
removed
-LRB-
though
young
Nightingale
knew
*NL*
not
as
yet
in
what
manner
-RRB-
,
and
all
parties
being
quickly
ready
,
the
*NL*
mother
,
Mr
Jones
,
Mr
Nightingale
,
and
his
love
,
stept
into
a
*NL*
hackney-coach
,
which
conveyed
them
to
Doctors
'
Commons
;
where
Miss
*NL*
Nancy
was
,
in
vulgar
language
,
soon
made
an
honest
woman
,
and
the
poor
*NL*
mother
became
,
in
the
purest
sense
of
the
word
,
one
of
the
happiest
of
*NL*
all
human
beings
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
Mr
Jones
,
having
seen
his
good
offices
to
that
poor
woman
and
*NL*
her
family
brought
to
a
happy
conclusion
,
began
to
apply
himself
to
*NL*
his
own
concerns
;
but
here
,
lest
many
of
my
readers
should
censure
his
*NL*
folly
for
thus
troubling
himself
with
the
affairs
of
others
,
and
lest
*NL*
some
few
should
think
he
acted
more
disinterestedly
than
indeed
he
*NL*
did
,
we
think
proper
to
assure
our
reader
,
that
he
was
so
far
from
*NL*
being
unconcerned
in
this
matter
,
that
he
had
indeed
a
very
*NL*
considerable
interest
in
bringing
it
to
that
final
consummation
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
explain
this
seeming
paradox
at
once
,
he
was
one
who
could
truly
*NL*
say
with
him
in
Terence
,
_
Homo
sum
:
humani
nihil
a
me
alienum
puto
_
.
*NL*
He
was
never
an
indifferent
spectator
of
the
misery
or
happiness
of
*NL*
any
one
;
and
he
felt
either
the
one
or
the
other
in
great
proportion
*NL*
as
he
himself
contributed
to
either
.
He
could
not
,
therefore
,
be
the
*NL*
instrument
of
raising
a
whole
family
from
the
lowest
state
of
*NL*
wretchedness
to
the
highest
pitch
of
joy
without
conveying
great
*NL*
felicity
to
himself
;
more
perhaps
than
worldly
men
often
purchase
to
*NL*
themselves
by
undergoing
the
most
severe
labour
,
and
often
by
wading
*NL*
through
the
deepest
iniquity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
readers
who
are
of
the
same
complexion
with
him
will
perhaps
*NL*
think
this
short
chapter
contains
abundance
of
matter
;
while
others
*NL*
may
probably
wish
,
short
as
it
is
,
that
it
had
been
totally
spared
as
*NL*
impertinent
to
the
main
design
,
which
I
suppose
they
conclude
is
to
*NL*
bring
Mr
Jones
to
the
gallows
,
or
,
if
possible
,
to
a
more
deplorable
*NL*
catastrophe

opened

LETTER

*NL*
``
Surely
I
am
under
some
strange
infatuation

I
can
not
keep
my
*NL*
resolutions
a
moment

however
strongly
made
or
justly
founded
.
Last
*NL*
night
I
resolved
never

see
you
more
;
this
morning
I
am
willing
to
*NL*
hear
if
you
can
,
as
you
say
,
clear
up
this
affair

And
yet
I
know
*NL*
that
to
be
impossible
.
I
have
said
everything
to
myself
which
you
*NL*
can
invent
.

Perhaps
not

Perhaps
your
invention
is
stronger

Come
*NL*
to
me

therefore
,
the
moment
you
receive
this

If
you
can
forge
an
*NL*
excuse
I
almost
promise
you
to
believe
it

Betrayed
too

I
will
*NL*
think
no
more

Come
to
me
directly

This

third

have
writ

former
are
burnt

am
almost
inclined
to
burn

*NL*
*NL*
Jones
had
just
read
over
these
three
billets
when
Mr
Nightingale
came
*NL*
into
the
room
.
``
Well

Tom

said
he
,
``
any
news

Bellaston

it
was

any
one
in

that
house

the
lady
was

``
The
Lady
Bellaston

answered
Jones
*NL*
very
gravely

``
Nay

Tom

cries
Nightingale
,
``
do
n't
be
so

reserved
to

friends

Though
I
was
too
drunk
to
see
her
last

night
,
I
saw
her
at
the
masquerade

Do
you
think
I
am
ignorant
who
the
*NL*
queen
of
the
fairies
is
?

``
And
did
you
really
then
know
the
lady
at
*NL*
the
masquerade
?
''
said
Jones
.
``
Yes
,
upon
my
soul
,
did
I
,
''
said
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
and
have
given
you
twenty
hints
of
it
since
,
though
you
*NL*
seemed
always
so
tender
on
that
point
,
that
I
would
not
speak
plainly
.
*NL*
I
fancy
,
my
friend
,
by
your
extreme
nicety
in
this
matter
,
you
are
not
*NL*
so
well
acquainted
with
the
character
of
the
lady
as
with
her
person

*NL*
Do
n't
be
angry
,
Tom
,
but
upon
my
honour
,
you
are
not
the
first
young
*NL*
fellow
she
hath
debauched
.
Her
reputation
is
in
no
danger
,
believe
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Jones
had
no
reason
to
imagine
the
lady
to
have
been
of
the
*NL*
vestal
kind
when
his
amour
began
;
yet
,
as
he
was
thoroughly
ignorant
*NL*
of
the
town
,
and
had
very
little
acquaintance
in
it
,
he
had
no
*NL*
knowledge
of
that
character
which
is
vulgarly
called
a
demirep
;
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
a
woman
who
intrigues
with
every
man
she
likes
,
under
the
*NL*
name
and
appearance
of
virtue
;
and
who
,
though
some
over-nice
ladies
*NL*
will
not
be
seen
with
her
,
is
visited
-LRB-
as
they
term
it
-RRB-
by
the
whole
*NL*
town
,
in
short
,
whom
everybody
knows
to
be
what
nobody
calls
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
found
,
therefore
,
that
Nightingale
was
perfectly
acquainted
*NL*
with
his
intrigue
,
and
began
to
suspect
that
so
scrupulous
a
delicacy
*NL*
as
he
had
hitherto
observed
was
not
quite
necessary
on
the
occasion
,
*NL*
he
gave
a
latitude
to
his
friend
's
tongue
,
and
desired
him
to
speak
*NL*
plainly
what
he
knew
,
or
had
ever
heard
of
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nightingale
,
who
,
in
many
other
instances
,
was
rather
too
effeminate
*NL*
in
his
disposition
,
had
a
pretty
strong
inclination
to
tittle-tattle
.
*NL*
He
had
no
sooner
,
therefore
,
received
a
full
liberty
of
speaking
from
*NL*
Jones
,
than
he
entered
upon
a
long
narrative
concerning
the
lady
;
*NL*
which
,
as
it
contained
many
particulars
highly
to
her
dishonour
,
we
*NL*
have
too
great
a
tenderness
for
all
women
of
condition
to
repeat
.
We
*NL*
would
cautiously
avoid
giving
an
opportunity
to
the
future
*NL*
commentators
on
our
works
,
of
making
any
malicious
application
and
of
*NL*
forcing
us
to
be
,
against
our
will
,
the
author
of
scandal
,
which
never
*NL*
entered
into
our
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
having
very
attentively
heard
all
that
Nightingale
had
to
say
,
*NL*
fetched
a
deep
sigh
;
which
the
other
,
observing
,
cried
,
``
Heyday
!
why
,
*NL*
thou
art
not
in
love
,
I
hope
!
Had
I
imagined
my
stories
would
have
*NL*
affected
you
,
I
promise
you
should
never
have
heard
them
.
''
``
O
my
dear
*NL*
friend
!
''
cries
Jones
,
``
I
am
so
entangled
with
this
woman
,
that
I
know
*NL*
not
how
to
extricate
myself
.
In
love
,
indeed
!
no
,
my
friend
,
but
I
am
*NL*
under
obligations
to
her
,
and
very
great
ones
.
Since
you
know
so
much
,
*NL*
I
will
be
very
explicit
with
you
.
It
is
owing
,
perhaps
,
solely
to
her
,
*NL*
that
I
have
not
,
before
this
,
wanted
a
bit
of
bread
.
How
can
I
*NL*
possibly
desert
such
a
woman
?
and
yet
I
must
desert
her
,
or
be
guilty
*NL*
of
the
blackest
treachery
to
one
who
deserves
infinitely
better
of
me
*NL*
than
she
can
;
a
woman
,
my
Nightingale
,
for
whom
I
have
a
passion
which
*NL*
few
can
have
an
idea
of
.
I
am
half
distracted
with
doubts
how
to
act
.
''
*NL*
``
And
is
this
other
,
pray
,
an
honourable
mistress
?
''
cries
Nightingale
.
*NL*
``
Honourable
!
''
answered
Jones
;
``
no
breath
ever
yet
durst
sully
her
*NL*
reputation
.
The
sweetest
air
is
not
purer
,
the
limpid
stream
not
*NL*
clearer
,
than
her
honour
.
She
is
all
over
,
both
in
mind
and
body
,
*NL*
consummate
perfection
.
She
is
the
most
beautiful
creature
in
the
*NL*
universe
:
and
yet
she
is
mistress
of
such
noble
elevated
qualities
,
*NL*
that
,
though
she
is
never
from
my
thoughts
,
I
scarce
ever
think
of
her
*NL*
beauty
but
when
I
see
it
.
''
--
``
And
can
you
,
my
good
friend
,
''
cries
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
with
such
an
engagement
as
this
upon
your
hands
,
*NL*
hesitate
a
moment
about
quitting
such
a
--
''
``
Hold
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
no
*NL*
more
abuse
of
her
:
I
detest
the
thought
of
ingratitude
.
''
``
Pooh
!
''
*NL*
answered
the
other
,
``
you
are
not
the
first
upon
whom
she
hath
*NL*
conferred
obligations
of
this
kind
.
She
is
remarkably
liberal
where
*NL*
she
likes
;
though
,
let
me
tell
you
,
her
favours
are
so
prudently
*NL*
bestowed
,
that
they
should
rather
raise
a
man
's
vanity
than
his
*NL*
gratitude
.
''
In
short
,
Nightingale
proceeded
so
far
on
this
head
,
and
*NL*
told
his
friend
so
many
stories
of
the
lady
,
which
he
swore
to
the
*NL*
truth
of
,
that
he
entirely
removed
all
esteem
for
her
from
the
breast
*NL*
of
Jones
;
and
his
gratitude
was
lessened
in
proportion
.
Indeed
,
he
*NL*
began
to
look
on
all
the
favours
he
had
received
rather
as
wages
than
*NL*
benefits
,
which
depreciated
not
only
her
,
but
himself
too
in
his
own
*NL*
conceit
,
and
put
him
quite
out
of
humour
with
both
.
From
this
disgust
,
*NL*
his
mind
,
by
a
natural
transition
,
turned
towards
Sophia
;
her
virtue
,
*NL*
her
purity
,
her
love
to
him
,
her
sufferings
on
his
account
,
filled
all
*NL*
his
thoughts
,
and
made
his
commerce
with
Lady
Bellaston
appear
still
*NL*
more
odious
.
The
result
of
all
was
,
that
,
though
his
turning
himself
*NL*
out
of
her
service
,
in
which
light
he
now
saw
his
affair
with
her
,
*NL*
would
be
the
loss
of
his
bread
;
yet
he
determined
to
quit
her
,
if
he
*NL*
could
but
find
a
handsome
pretence
:
which
being
communicated
to
his
*NL*
friend
,
Nightingale
considered
a
little
,
and
then
said
,
``
I
have
it
,
my
*NL*
boy
!
I
have
found
out
a
sure
method
;
propose
marriage
to
her
,
and
I
*NL*
would
venture
hanging
upon
the
success
.
''
``
Marriage
?
''
cries
Jones
.
``
Ay
,
*NL*
propose
marriage
,
''
answered
Nightingale
,
``
and
she
will
declare
off
in
*NL*
a
moment
.
I
knew
a
young
fellow
whom
she
kept
formerly
,
who
made
the
*NL*
offer
to
her
in
earnest
,
and
was
presently
turned
off
for
his
pains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
declared
he
could
not
venture
the
experiment
.
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
*NL*
he
,
``
she
may
be
less
shocked
at
this
proposal
from
one
man
than
from
*NL*
another
.
And
if
she
should
take
me
at
my
word
,
where
am
I
then
?
*NL*
caught
,
in
my
own
trap
,
and
undone
for
ever
.
''
``
No
;
''
answered
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
not
if
I
can
give
you
an
expedient
by
which
you
may
at
*NL*
any
time
get
out
of
the
trap
.
''
--
``
What
expedient
can
that
be
?
''
*NL*
replied
Jones
.
``
This
,
''
answered
Nightingale
.
``
The
young
fellow
I
*NL*
mentioned
,
who
is
one
of
the
most
intimate
acquaintances
I
have
in
the
*NL*
world
,
is
so
angry
with
her
for
some
ill
offices
she
hath
since
done
*NL*
him
,
that
I
am
sure
he
would
,
without
any
difficulty
,
give
you
a
sight
*NL*
of
her
letters
;
upon
which
you
may
decently
break
with
her
;
and
*NL*
declare
off
before
the
knot
is
tyed
,
if
she
should
really
be
willing
*NL*
to
tie
it
,
which
I
am
convinced
she
will
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
hesitation
,
Jones
,
upon
the
strength
of
this
assurance
,
*NL*
consented
;
but
,
as
he
swore
he
wanted
the
confidence
to
propose
the
*NL*
matter
to
her
face
,
he
wrote
the
following
letter
,
which
Nightingale
*NL*
dictated
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
MADAM
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
extremely
concerned

by
an
unfortunate
engagement

abroad
,
I
should
have
missed
receiving
the
honour
of
your
ladyship
's
*NL*
commands
the
moment
they
came
;
and
the
delay
which
I
must
now
suffer
*NL*
of
vindicating
myself
to
your
ladyship
greatly
adds
to
this
*NL*
misfortune
.
O
,
Lady
Bellaston
!
what
a
terror
have
I
been
in
for
fear
*NL*
your
reputation
should
be
exposed
by
these
perverse
accidents
!
There
*NL*
is
one
only
way
to
secure
it

I
need
not
name
what
that
is

Only
*NL*
permit
me
to
say

that
as
your
honour
is
as
dear

the
glory

THOMAS
JONES

*NL*
*NL*
To
this
she
presently
returned
the
following
answer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
SIR
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
read
over
your
serious
epistle
,
I
could
,
from
its
coldness
*NL*
and
formality
,
have
sworn
that
you
already
had
the
legal
right
you
*NL*
mention
;
nay
,
that
we
had
for
many
years
composed
that
monstrous
*NL*
animal
a
husband
and
wife
.
Do
you
really
then
imagine
me
a
fool
?
or
*NL*
do
you
fancy
yourself
capable
of
so
entirely
persuading
me
out
of
my
*NL*
senses
,
that
I
should
deliver
my
whole
fortune
into
your
power
,
in
*NL*
order
to
enable
you
to
support
your
pleasures
at
my
expense
?
Are
*NL*
these
the
proofs
of
love
which
I
expected
?
Is
this
the
return
for

?
*NL*
but
I
scorn
to
upbraid
you

am
in
great
admiration
of
your
*NL*
profound
respect

*NL*
*NL*
``
P.S.
I
am
prevented
from
revising
:
--
Perhaps
I
have
said
more
than
*NL*
I
meant
.
--
Come
to
me
at
eight
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
by
the
advice
of
his
privy-council
,
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
MADAM
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
to
express
how
much
I
am
shocked
at
the
suspicion
*NL*
you
entertain
of
me
.
Can
Lady
Bellaston
have
conferred
favours
on
a
*NL*
man
whom
she
could
believe
capable
of
so
base
a
design
?
or
can
she
*NL*
treat
the
most
solemn
tie
of
love
with
contempt
?
Can
you
imagine
,
*NL*
madam
,
that
if
the
violence
of
my
passion
,
in
an
unguarded
moment
,
*NL*
overcame
the
tenderness
which
I
have
for
your
honour
,
I
would
think
*NL*
of
indulging
myself
in
the
continuance
of
an
intercourse
which
could
*NL*
not
possibly
escape
long
the
notice
of
the
world
;
and
which
,
when
*NL*
discovered
,
must
prove
so
fatal
to
your
reputation
?
If
such
be
your
*NL*
opinion
of
me
,
I
must
pray
for
a
sudden
opportunity
of
returning
*NL*
those
pecuniary
obligations
,
which
I
have
been
so
unfortunate
to
*NL*
receive
at
your
hands
;
and
for
those
of
a
more
tender
kind
,
I
shall
*NL*
ever
remain

&
c.
''
And
so
concluded
in
the
very
words
with
which
he
*NL*
had
concluded
the
former
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lady
answered
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
you
are
a
villain
!
and
I
despise
you
from
my
soul
.
If
you
*NL*
come
here
I
shall
not
be
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Jones
was
well
satisfied
with
his
deliverance
from
a
thraldom
*NL*
which
those
who
have
ever
experienced
it
will
,
I
apprehend
,
allow
to
*NL*
be
none
of
the
lightest
,
he
was
not
,
however
,
perfectly
easy
in
his
*NL*
mind
.
There
was
in
this
scheme
too
much
of
fallacy
to
satisfy
one
who
*NL*
utterly
detested
every
species
of
falshood
or
dishonesty
:
nor
would
*NL*
he
,
indeed
,
have
submitted
to
put
it
in
practice
,
had
he
not
been
*NL*
involved
in
a
distressful
situation
,
where
he
was
obliged
to
be
guilty
*NL*
of
some
dishonour
,
either
to
the
one
lady
or
the
other
;
and
surely
the
*NL*
reader
will
allow
,
that
every
good
principle
,
as
well
as
love
,
pleaded
*NL*
strongly
in
favour
of
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nightingale
highly
exulted
in
the
success
of
his
stratagem
,
upon
which
*NL*
he
received
many
thanks
and
much
applause
from
his
friend
.
He
*NL*
answered
,
``
Dear
Tom
,
we
have
conferred
very
different
obligations
on
*NL*
each
other
.
To
me
you
owe
the
regaining
your
liberty
;
to
you
I
owe
the
*NL*
loss
of
mine
.
But
if
you
are
as
happy
in
the
one
instance
as
I
am
in
*NL*
the
other
,
I
promise
you
we
are
the
two
happiest
fellows
in
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
gentlemen
were
now
summoned
down
to
dinner
,
where
Mrs
Miller
,
*NL*
who
performed
herself
the
office
of
cook
,
had
exerted
her
best
talents
*NL*
to
celebrate
the
wedding
of
her
daughter
.
This
joyful
circumstance
she
*NL*
ascribed
principally
to
the
friendly
behaviour
of
Jones
,
her
whole
*NL*
soul
was
fired
with
gratitude
towards
him
,
and
all
her
looks
,
words
,
*NL*
and
actions
,
were
so
busied
in
expressing
it
,
that
her
daughter
,
and
*NL*
even
her
new
son-in-law
,
were
very
little
objects
of
her
*NL*
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
was
just
ended
when
Mrs
Miller
received
a
letter
;
but
as
we
*NL*
have
had
letters
enow
in
this
chapter
,
we
shall
communicate
its
*NL*
contents
in
our
next
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
x.
*NL*
*NL*
Consisting
partly
of
facts
,
and
partly
of
observations
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
then
which
arrived
at
the
end
of
the
preceding
chapter
was
*NL*
from
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
the
purport
of
it
was
,
his
intention
to
come
*NL*
immediately
to
town
,
with
his
nephew
Blifil
,
and
a
desire
to
be
*NL*
accommodated
with
his
usual
lodgings
,
which
were
the
first
floor
for
*NL*
himself
,
and
the
second
for
his
nephew
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chearfulness
which
had
before
displayed
itself
in
the
countenance
*NL*
of
the
poor
woman
was
a
little
clouded
on
this
occasion
.
This
news
did
*NL*
indeed
a
good
deal
disconcert
her
.
To
requite
so
disinterested
a
match
*NL*
with
her
daughter
,
by
presently
turning
her
new
son-in-law
out
of
*NL*
doors
,
appeared
to
her
very
unjustifiable
on
the
one
hand
;
and
on
the
*NL*
other
,
she
could
scarce
bear
the
thoughts
of
making
any
excuse
to
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
after
all
the
obligations
received
from
him
,
for
depriving
*NL*
him
of
lodgings
which
were
indeed
strictly
his
due
;
for
that
*NL*
gentleman
,
in
conferring
all
his
numberless
benefits
on
others
,
acted
*NL*
by
a
rule
diametrically
opposite
to
what
is
practised
by
most
generous
*NL*
people
.
He
contrived
,
on
all
occasions
,
to
hide
his
beneficence
,
not
*NL*
only
from
the
world
,
but
even
from
the
object
of
it
.
He
constantly
*NL*
used
the
words
Lend
and
Pay
,
instead
of
Give
;
and
by
every
other
*NL*
method
he
could
invent
,
always
lessened
with
his
tongue
the
favours
he
*NL*
conferred
,
while
he
was
heaping
them
with
both
his
hands
.
When
he
*NL*
settled
the
annuity
of
L50
a
year
therefore
on
Mrs
Miller
,
he
told
*NL*
her
,
``
it
was
in
consideration
of
always
having
her
first-floor
when
he
*NL*
was
in
town
-LRB-
which
he
scarce
ever
intended
to
be
-RRB-
,
but
that
she
might
*NL*
let
it
at
any
other
time
,
for
that
he
would
always
send
her
a
month
's
*NL*
warning
.
''
He
was
now
,
however
,
hurried
to
town
so
suddenly
,
that
he
*NL*
had
no
opportunity
of
giving
such
notice
;
and
this
hurry
probably
*NL*
prevented
him
,
when
he
wrote
for
his
lodgings
,
adding
,
if
they
were
*NL*
then
empty
;
for
he
would
most
certainly
have
been
well
satisfied
to
*NL*
have
relinquished
them
,
on
a
less
sufficient
excuse
than
what
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
could
now
have
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
are
a
sort
of
persons
,
who
,
as
Prior
excellently
well
*NL*
remarks
,
direct
their
conduct
by
something
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
fix
'd
and
settled
rules
*NL*
Of
vice
and
virtue
in
the
schools
,
*NL*
Beyond
the
letter
of
the
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
these
it
is
so
far
from
being
sufficient
that
their
defence
would
*NL*
acquit
them
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
that
they
are
not
even
contented
,
*NL*
though
conscience
,
the
severest
of
all
judges
,
should
discharge
them
.
*NL*
Nothing
short
of
the
fair
and
honourable
will
satisfy
the
delicacy
of
*NL*
their
minds
;
and
if
any
of
their
actions
fall
short
of
this
mark
,
they
*NL*
mope
and
pine
,
are
as
uneasy
and
restless
as
a
murderer
,
who
is
afraid
*NL*
of
a
ghost
,
or
of
the
hangman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
was
one
of
these
.
She
could
not
conceal
her
uneasiness
at
*NL*
this
letter
;
with
the
contents
of
which
she
had
no
sooner
acquainted
*NL*
the
company
,
and
given
some
hints
of
her
distress
,
than
Jones
,
her
*NL*
good
angel
,
presently
relieved
her
anxiety
.
``
As
for
myself
,
madam
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
my
lodging
is
at
your
service
at
a
moment
's
warning
;
and
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
,
I
am
sure
,
as
he
can
not
yet
prepare
a
house
fit
to
*NL*
receive
his
lady
,
will
consent
to
return
to
his
new
lodging
,
whither
*NL*
Mrs
Nightingale
will
certainly
consent
to
go
.
''
With
which
proposal
*NL*
both
husband
and
wife
instantly
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
easily
believe
,
that
the
cheeks
of
Mrs
Miller
began
*NL*
again
to
glow
with
additional
gratitude
to
Jones
;
but
,
perhaps
,
it
may
*NL*
be
more
difficult
to
persuade
him
,
that
Mr
Jones
having
in
his
last
*NL*
speech
called
her
daughter
Mrs
Nightingale
-LRB-
it
being
the
first
time
*NL*
that
agreeable
sound
had
ever
reached
her
ears
-RRB-
,
gave
the
fond
mother
*NL*
more
satisfaction
,
and
warmed
her
heart
more
towards
Jones
,
than
his
*NL*
having
dissipated
her
present
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
then
appointed
for
the
removal
of
the
new-married
*NL*
couple
,
and
of
Mr
Jones
,
who
was
likewise
to
be
provided
for
in
the
*NL*
same
house
with
his
friend
.
And
now
the
serenity
of
the
company
was
*NL*
again
restored
,
and
they
past
the
day
in
the
utmost
chearfulness
,
all
*NL*
except
Jones
,
who
,
though
he
outwardly
accompanied
the
rest
in
their
*NL*
mirth
,
felt
many
a
bitter
pang
on
the
account
of
his
Sophia
,
which
*NL*
were
not
a
little
heightened
by
the
news
of
Mr
Blifil
's
coming
to
town
*NL*
-LRB-
for
he
clearly
saw
the
intention
of
his
journey
-RRB-
;
and
what
greatly
*NL*
aggravated
his
concern
was
,
that
Mrs
Honour
,
who
had
promised
to
*NL*
inquire
after
Sophia
,
and
to
make
her
report
to
him
early
the
next
*NL*
evening
,
had
disappointed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
situation
that
he
and
his
mistress
were
in
at
this
time
,
there
*NL*
were
scarce
any
grounds
for
him
to
hope
that
he
should
hear
any
good
*NL*
news
;
yet
he
was
as
impatient
to
see
Mrs
Honour
as
if
he
had
expected
*NL*
she
would
bring
him
a
letter
with
an
assignation
in
it
from
Sophia
,
*NL*
and
bore
the
disappointment
as
ill
.
Whether
this
impatience
arose
from
*NL*
that
natural
weakness
of
the
human
mind
,
which
makes
it
desirous
to
*NL*
know
the
worst
,
and
renders
uncertainty
the
most
intolerable
of
pains
;
*NL*
or
whether
he
still
flattered
himself
with
some
secret
hopes
,
we
will
*NL*
not
determine
.
But
that
it
might
be
the
last
,
whoever
has
loved
can
not
*NL*
but
know
.
For
of
all
the
powers
exercised
by
this
passion
over
our
*NL*
minds
,
one
of
the
most
wonderful
is
that
of
supporting
hope
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
despair
.
Difficulties
,
improbabilities
,
nay
,
impossibilities
,
*NL*
are
quite
overlooked
by
it
;
so
that
to
any
man
extremely
in
love
,
may
*NL*
be
applied
what
Addison
says
of
Caesar
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Alps
,
and
Pyrenaeans
,
sink
before
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
it
is
equally
true
,
that
the
same
passion
will
sometimes
make
*NL*
mountains
of
molehills
,
and
produce
despair
in
the
midst
of
hope
;
but
*NL*
these
cold
fits
last
not
long
in
good
constitutions
.
Which
temper
*NL*
Jones
was
now
in
,
we
leave
the
reader
to
guess
,
having
no
exact
*NL*
information
about
it
;
but
this
is
certain
,
that
he
had
spent
two
hours
*NL*
in
expectation
,
when
,
being
unable
any
longer
to
conceal
his
*NL*
uneasiness
,
he
retired
to
his
room
;
where
his
anxiety
had
almost
made
*NL*
him
frantick
,
when
the
following
letter
was
brought
him
from
Mrs
*NL*

Various
were
the
conjectures
which
Jones
entertained
on
this
step
of
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
;
who
,
in
reality
,
had
little
farther
design
than
to
*NL*
secure
within
her
own
house
the
repository
of
a
secret
,
which
she
*NL*
chose
should
make
no
farther
progress
than
it
had
made
already
;
but
*NL*
mostly
,
she
desired
to
keep
it
from
the
ears
of
Sophia
;
for
though
*NL*
that
young
lady
was
almost
the
only
one
who
would
never
have
repeated
*NL*
it
again
,
her
ladyship
could
not
persuade
herself
of
this
;
since
,
as
*NL*
she
now
hated
poor
Sophia
with
most
implacable
hatred
,
she
conceived
a
*NL*
reciprocal
hatred
to
herself
to
be
lodged
in
the
tender
breast
of
our
*NL*
heroine
,
where
no
such
passion
had
ever
yet
found
an
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Jones
was
terrifying
himself
with
the
apprehension
of
a
thousand
*NL*
dreadful
machinations
,
and
deep
political
designs
,
which
he
imagined
*NL*
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
promotion
of
Honour
,
Fortune
,
who
hitherto
*NL*
seems
to
have
been
an
utter
enemy
to
his
match
with
Sophia
,
tried
a
*NL*
new
method
to
put
a
final
end
to
it
,
by
throwing
a
temptation
in
his
*NL*
way
,
which
in
his
present
desperate
situation
it
seemed
unlikely
he
*NL*
should
be
able
to
resist

*NL*
Containing
curious
,
but
not
unprecedented
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
lady
,
one
Mrs
Hunt
,
who
had
often
seen
Jones
at
the
house
*NL*
where
he
lodged
,
being
intimately
acquainted
with
the
women
there
,
and
*NL*
indeed
a
very
great
friend
to
Mrs
Miller
.
Her
age
was
about
thirty
,
*NL*
for
she
owned
six-and-twenty
;
her
face
and
person
very
good
,
only
*NL*
inclining
a
little
too
much
to
be
fat
.
She
had
been
married
young
by
*NL*
her
relations
to
an
old
Turkey
merchant
,
who
,
having
got
a
great
*NL*
fortune
,
had
left
off
trade
.
With
him
she
lived
without
reproach
,
but
*NL*
not
without
pain
,
in
a
state
of
great
self-denial
,
for
about
twelve
*NL*
years
;
and
her
virtue
was
rewarded
by
his
dying
and
leaving
her
very
*NL*
rich
.
The
first
year
of
her
widowhood
was
just
at
an
end
,
and
she
had
*NL*
past
it
in
a
good
deal
of
retirement
,
seeing
only
a
few
particular
*NL*
friends
,
and
dividing
her
time
between
her
devotions
and
novels
,
of
*NL*
which
she
was
always
extremely
fond
.
Very
good
health
,
a
very
warm
*NL*
constitution
,
and
a
good
deal
of
religion
,
made
it
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
for
her
to
marry
again
;
and
she
resolved
to
please
herself
*NL*
in
her
second
husband
,
as
she
had
done
her
friends
in
the
first
.
From
*NL*
her
the
following
billet
was
brought
to
Jones
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
SIR
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
first
day
I
saw
you
,
I
doubt
my
eyes
have
told
you
too
*NL*
plainly
that
you
were
not
indifferent
to
me
;
but
neither
my
tongue
*NL*
nor
my
hand
should
have
ever
avowed
it
,
had
not
the
ladies
of
the
*NL*
family
where
you
are
lodged
given
me
such
a
character
of
you
,
and
*NL*
told
me
such
proofs
of
your
virtue
and
goodness
,
as
convince
me
you
*NL*
are
not
only
the
most
agreeable
,
but
the
most
worthy
of
men
.
I
have
*NL*
also
the
satisfaction
to
hear
from
them
,
that
neither
my
person
,
*NL*
understanding
,
or
character
,
are
disagreeable
to
you
.
I
have
a
*NL*
fortune
sufficient
to
make
us
both
happy
,
but
which
can
not
make
me
*NL*
so
without
you
.
In
thus
disposing
of
myself
,
I
know
I
shall
incur
*NL*
the
censure
of
the
world
;
but
if
I
did
not
love
you
more
than
I
fear
*NL*
the
world
,
I
should
not
be
worthy
of
you
.
One
only
difficulty
stops
*NL*
me
:
I
am
informed
you
are
engaged
in
a
commerce
of
gallantry
with
a
*NL*
woman
of
fashion
.
If
you
think
it
worth
while
to
sacrifice
that
to
*NL*
the
possession
of
me
,
I
am
yours
;
if
not
,
forget
my
weakness
,
and
*NL*
let
this
remain
an
eternal
secret
between
you
and
*NL*
*NL*

ARABELLA
HUNT

*NL*
At
the
reading
of
this
,
Jones
was
put
into
a
violent
flutter
.
His
*NL*
fortune
was
then
at
a
very
low
ebb
,
the
source
being
stopt
from
which
*NL*
hitherto
he
had
been
supplied
.
Of
all
he
had
received
from
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
,
not
above
five
guineas
remained
;
and
that
very
morning
he
*NL*
had
been
dunned
by
a
tradesman
for
twice
that
sum
.
His
honourable
*NL*
mistress
was
in
the
hands
of
her
father
,
and
he
had
scarce
any
hopes
*NL*
ever
to
get
her
out
of
them
again
.
To
be
subsisted
at
her
expense
,
*NL*
from
that
little
fortune
she
had
independent
of
her
father
,
went
much
*NL*
against
the
delicacy
both
of
his
pride
and
his
love
.
This
lady
's
*NL*
fortune
would
have
been
exceeding
convenient
to
him
,
and
he
could
have
*NL*
no
objection
to
her
in
any
respect
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
liked
her
as
*NL*
well
as
he
did
any
woman
except
Sophia
.
But
to
abandon
Sophia
,
and
*NL*
marry
another
,
that
was
impossible
;
he
could
not
think
of
it
upon
any
*NL*
account
,
Yet
why
should
he
not
,
since
it
was
plain
she
could
not
be
*NL*
his
?
Would
it
not
be
kinder
to
her
,
than
to
continue
her
longer
*NL*
engaged
in
a
hopeless
passion
for
him
?
Ought
he
not
to
do
so
in
*NL*
friendship
to
her
?
This
notion
prevailed
some
moments
,
and
he
had
*NL*
almost
determined
to
be
false
to
her
from
a
high
point
of
honour
:
but
*NL*
that
refinement
was
not
able
to
stand
very
long
against
the
voice
of
*NL*
nature
,
which
cried
in
his
heart
that
such
friendship
was
treason
to
*NL*
love
.
At
last
he
called
for
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
writ
as
follows
*NL*
to
Mrs
Hunt
:
--
*NL*
*NL*

It
would

return

possession
of
you

and
I
would
*NL*
certainly

I
were
not
disengaged

at

of
that
kind
.
But
I
should
not
be
the
honest
man
you
*NL*
think
me
,
if
I
did
not
tell
you
that
my
affections
are
engaged
to
*NL*
another
,
who
is
a
woman
of
virtue
,
and
one
that
I
never
can
leave
,
*NL*
though
it
is
probable
I
shall
never
possess
her
.
God
forbid
that
,
in
*NL*
return
of
your
kindness
to
me
,
I
should
do
you
such
an
injury
as
to
*NL*
give
you
my
hand
when
I
can
not
give
my
heart
.
No
;
I
had
much
rather
*NL*
starve
than
be
guilty
of
that
.
Even
though
my
mistress
were
married
*NL*
to
another
,
I
would
not
marry
you
unless
my
heart
had
entirely
*NL*
effaced
all
impressions
of
her
.
Be
assured
that
your
secret
was
not
*NL*
more
safe
in
your
own
breast
,
than
in
that
of
your
most
obliged
,
and
*NL*
grateful
humble
servant

When
our
heroe
had
finished
and
sent
this
letter
,
he
went
to
his
*NL*
scrutore
,
took
out
Miss
Western
's
muff
,
kissed
it
several
times
,
and
*NL*
then
strutted
some
turns
about
his
room
,
with
more
satisfaction
of
*NL*
mind
than
ever
any
Irishman
felt
in
carrying
off
a
fortune
of
fifty
*NL*
thousand
pounds

A
discovery
made
by
Partridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Jones
was
exulting
in
the
consciousness
of
his
integrity
,
*NL*
Partridge
came
capering
into
the
room
,
as
was
his
custom
when
he
*NL*
brought
,
or
fancied
he
brought
,
any
good
tidings
.
He
had
been
*NL*
despatched
that
morning
by
his
master
,
with
orders
to
endeavour
,
by
*NL*
the
servants
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
or
by
any
other
means
,
to
discover
*NL*
whither
Sophia
had
been
conveyed
;
and
he
now
returned
,
and
with
a
*NL*
joyful
countenance
told
our
heroe
that
he
had
found
the
lost
bird
.
``
I
*NL*
have
seen
,
sir
,
''
says
he
,
``
Black
George
,
the
gamekeeper
,
who
is
one
of
*NL*
the
servants
whom
the
squire
hath
brought
with
him
to
town
.
I
knew
him
*NL*
presently
,
though
I
have
not
seen
him
these
several
years
;
but
you
*NL*
know
,
sir
,
he
is
a
very
remarkable
man
,
or
,
to
use
a
purer
phrase
,
he
*NL*
hath
a
most
remarkable
beard
,
the
largest
and
blackest
I
ever
saw
.
It
*NL*
was
some
time
,
however
,
before
Black
George
could
recollect
me
.
''
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
what
is
your
good
news
?
''
cries
Jones
;
``
what
do
you
know
of
*NL*
my
Sophia
?
''
``
You
shall
know
presently
,
sir
,
''
answered
Partridge
,
``
I
am
*NL*
coming
to
it
as
fast
as
I
can
.
You
are
so
impatient
,
sir
,
you
would
*NL*
come
at
the
infinitive
mood
before
you
can
get
to
the
imperative
.
As
I
*NL*
was
saying
,
sir
,
it
was
some
time
before
he
recollected
my
*NL*
face
.
''
--
``
Confound
your
face
!
''
cries
Jones
,
``
what
of
my
Sophia
?
''
``
Nay
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
answered
Partridge
,
``
I
know
nothing
more
of
Madam
Sophia
than
*NL*
what
I
am
going
to
tell
you
;
and
I
should
have
told
you
all
before
*NL*
this
if
you
had
not
interrupted
me
;
but
if
you
look
so
angry
at
me
you
*NL*
will
frighten
all
of
it
out
of
my
head
,
or
,
to
use
a
purer
phrase
,
out
*NL*
of
my
memory
.
I
never
saw
you
look
so
angry
since
the
day
we
left
*NL*
Upton
,
which
I
shall
remember
if
I
was
to
live
a
thousand
*NL*
years
.
''
--
``
Well
,
pray
go
on
your
own
way
,
''
said
Jones
:
``
you
are
*NL*
resolved
to
make
me
mad
I
find
.
''
``
Not
for
the
world
,
''
answered
*NL*
Partridge
,
``
I
have
suffered
enough
for
that
already
;
which
,
as
I
said
,
*NL*
I
shall
bear
in
my
remembrance
the
longest
day
I
have
to
live
.
''
``
Well
,
*NL*
but
Black
George
?
''
cries
Jones
.
``
Well
,
sir
,
as
I
was
saying
,
it
was
a
*NL*
long
time
before
he
could
recollect
me
;
for
,
indeed
,
I
am
very
much
*NL*
altered
since
I
saw
him
.
_
Non
sum
qualis
eram
.
_
I
have
had
troubles
in
*NL*
the
world
,
and
nothing
alters
a
man
so
much
as
grief
.
I
have
heard
it
*NL*
will
change
the
colour
of
a
man
's
hair
in
a
night
.
However
,
at
last
,
*NL*
know
me
he
did
,
that
's
sure
enough
;
for
we
are
both
of
an
age
,
and
*NL*
were
at
the
same
charity
school
.
George
was
a
great
dunce
,
but
no
*NL*
matter
for
that
;
all
men
do
not
thrive
in
the
world
according
to
their
*NL*
learning
.
I
am
sure
I
have
reason
to
say
so
;
but
it
will
be
all
one
a
*NL*
thousand
years
hence
.
Well
,
sir
,
where
was
I
?
--
O
--
well
,
we
no
sooner
*NL*
knew
each
other
,
than
,
after
many
hearty
shakes
by
the
hand
,
we
agreed
*NL*
to
go
to
an
alehouse
and
take
a
pot
,
and
by
good
luck
the
beer
was
*NL*
some
of
the
best
I
have
met
with
since
I
have
been
in
town
.
Now
,
sir
,
*NL*
I
am
coming
to
the
point
;
for
no
sooner
did
I
name
you
,
and
told
him
*NL*
that
you
and
I
came
to
town
together
,
and
had
lived
together
ever
*NL*
since
,
than
he
called
for
another
pot
,
and
swore
he
would
drink
to
*NL*
your
health
;
and
indeed
he
drank
your
health
so
heartily
that
I
was
*NL*
overjoyed
to
see
there
was
so
much
gratitude
left
in
the
world
;
and
*NL*
after
we
had
emptied
that
pot
I
said
I
would
buy
my
pot
too
,
and
so
we
*NL*
drank
another
to
your
health
;
and
then
I
made
haste
home
to
tell
you
*NL*
the
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
news
?
''
cries
Jones
,
``
you
have
not
mentioned
a
word
of
my
*NL*
Sophia
!
''
``
Bless
me
!
I
had
like
to
have
forgot
that
.
Indeed
,
we
*NL*
mentioned
a
great
deal
about
young
Madam
Western
,
and
George
told
me
*NL*
all
;
that
Mr
Blifil
is
coming
to
town
in
order
to
be
married
to
her
.
*NL*
He
had
best
make
haste
then
,
says
I
,
or
somebody
will
have
her
before
*NL*
he
comes
;
and
,
indeed
,
says
I
,
Mr
Seagrim
,
it
is
a
thousand
pities
*NL*
somebody
should
not
have
her
;
for
he
certainly
loves
her
above
all
the
*NL*
women
in
the
world
.
I
would
have
both
you
and
she
know
,
that
it
is
not
*NL*
for
her
fortune
he
follows
her
;
for
I
can
assure
you
,
as
to
matter
of
*NL*
that
,
there
is
another
lady
,
one
of
much
greater
quality
and
fortune
*NL*
than
she
can
pretend
to
,
who
is
so
fond
of
somebody
that
she
comes
*NL*
after
him
day
and
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Jones
fell
into
a
passion
with
Partridge
,
for
having
,
as
he
said
,
*NL*
betrayed
him
;
but
the
poor
fellow
answered
,
he
had
mentioned
no
name
:
*NL*
``
Besides
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
can
assure
you
George
is
sincerely
your
*NL*
friend
,
and
wished
Mr
Blifil
at
the
devil
more
than
once
;
nay
,
he
said
*NL*
he
would
do
anything
in
his
power
upon
earth
to
serve
you
;
and
so
I
am
*NL*
convinced
he
will
.
Betray
you
,
indeed
!
why
,
I
question
whether
you
*NL*
have
a
better
friend
than
George
upon
earth
,
except
myself
,
or
one
*NL*
that
would
go
farther
to
serve
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
Jones
,
a
little
pacified
,
``
you
say
this
fellow
,
who
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
indeed
,
is
enough
inclined
to
be
my
friend
,
lives
in
the
same
*NL*
house
with
Sophia
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
same
house
!
''
answered
Partridge
;
``
why
,
sir
,
he
is
one
of
the
*NL*
servants
of
the
family
,
and
very
well
drest
I
promise
you
he
is
;
if
it
*NL*
was
not
for
his
black
beard
you
would
hardly
know
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
service
then
at
least
he
may
do
me
,
''
says
Jones
:
``
sure
he
can
*NL*
certainly
convey
a
letter
to
my
Sophia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
hit
the
nail
_
ad
unguem
_
''
cries
Partridge
;
``
how
came
I
not
*NL*
to
think
of
it
?
I
will
engage
he
shall
do
it
upon
the
very
first
*NL*
mentioning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
do
you
leave
me
at
present
,
and
I
will
*NL*
write
a
letter
,
which
you
shall
deliver
to
him
to-morrow
morning
;
for
*NL*
I
suppose
you
know
where
to
find
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
sir
,
''
answered
Partridge
,
``
I
shall
certainly
find
him
again
;
*NL*
there
is
no
fear
of
that
.
The
liquor
is
too
good
for
him
to
stay
away
*NL*
long
.
I
make
no
doubt
but
he
will
be
there
every
day
he
stays
in
*NL*
town

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
do
n't
know
the
street
then
where
my
Sophia
is
lodged
?
''
cries
*NL*
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
I
do
,
''
says
Partridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
name
of
the
street
?
''
cries
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
name
,
sir
?
why
,
here
,
sir
,
just
by
,
''
answered
Partridge
,
``
not
*NL*
above
a
street
or
two
off
.
I
do
n't
,
indeed
,
know
the
very
name

for
,
*NL*
as
he
never
told
me
,
if
I
had
asked
,
you
know
,
it
might
have
put
some
*NL*
suspicion
into
his
head
.
No
,
no
,
sir
,
let
me
alone
for
that
.
I
am
too
*NL*
cunning
for
that
,
I
promise
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
art
most
wonderfully
cunning
,
indeed
,
''
replied
Jones
;
``
however
,
*NL*
I
will
write
to
my
charmer
,
since
I
believe
you
will
be
cunning
enough
*NL*
to
find
him
to-morrow
at
the
alehouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
having
dismissed
the
sagacious
Partridge
,
Mr
Jones
sat
*NL*
himself
down
to
write
,
in
which
employment
we
shall
leave
him
for
a
*NL*
time
.
And
here
we
put
an
end
to
the
fifteenth
book

*NL*
BOOK

*NL*
*NL*
CONTAINING
THE
SPACE
OF
FIVE
DAYS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
prologues
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
heard
of
a
dramatic
writer
who
used
to
say
,
he
would
rather
*NL*
write
a
play
than
a
prologue
;
in
like
manner
,
I
think
,
I
can
with
less
*NL*
pains
write
one
of
the
books
of
this
history
than
the
prefatory
*NL*
chapter
to
each
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
I
believe
many
a
hearty
curse
hath
been
devoted
on
*NL*
the
head
of
that
author
who
first
instituted
the
method
of
prefixing
*NL*
to
his
play
that
portion
of
matter
which
is
called
the
prologue
;
and
*NL*
which
at
first
was
part
of
the
piece
itself
,
but
of
latter
years
hath
*NL*
had
usually
so
little
connexion
with
the
drama
before
which
it
stands
,
*NL*
that
the
prologue
to
one
play
might
as
well
serve
for
any
other
.
Those
*NL*
indeed
of
more
modern
date
,
seem
all
to
be
written
on
the
same
three
*NL*
topics
,
viz.
,
an
abuse
of
the
taste
of
the
town
,
a
condemnation
of
all
*NL*
contemporary
authors
,
and
an
eulogium
on
the
performance
just
about
to
*NL*
be
represented
.
The
sentiments
in
all
these
are
very
little
varied
,
*NL*
nor
is
it
possible
they
should
;
and
indeed
I
have
often
wondered
at
*NL*
the
great
invention
of
authors
,
who
have
been
capable
of
finding
such
*NL*
various
phrases
to
express
the
same
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
like
manner
I
apprehend
,
some
future
historian
-LRB-
if
any
one
shall
do
*NL*
me
the
honour
of
imitating
my
manner
-RRB-
will
,
after
much
scratching
his
*NL*
pate
,
bestow
some
good
wishes
on
my
memory
,
for
having
first
*NL*
established
these
several
initial
chapters
;
most
of
which
,
like
modern
*NL*
prologues
,
may
as
properly
be
prefixed
to
any
other
book
in
this
*NL*
history
as
to
that
which
they
introduce
,
or
indeed
to
any
other
*NL*
history
as
to
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
however
authors
may
suffer
by
either
of
these
inventions
,
the
*NL*
reader
will
find
sufficient
emolument
in
the
one
as
the
spectator
hath
*NL*
long
found
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
it
is
well
known
that
the
prologue
serves
the
critic
for
an
*NL*
opportunity
to
try
his
faculty
of
hissing
,
and
to
tune
his
cat-call
to
*NL*
the
best
advantage
;
by
which
means
,
I
have
known
those
musical
*NL*
instruments
so
well
prepared
,
that
they
have
been
able
to
play
in
full
*NL*
concert
at
the
first
rising
of
the
curtain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
advantages
may
be
drawn
from
these
chapters
,
in
which
the
*NL*
critic
will
be
always
sure
of
meeting
with
something
that
may
serve
as
*NL*
a
whetstone
to
his
noble
spirit
;
so
that
he
may
fall
with
a
more
*NL*
hungry
appetite
for
censure
on
the
history
itself
.
And
here
his
*NL*
sagacity
must
make
it
needless
to
observe
how
artfully
these
chapters
*NL*
are
calculated
for
that
excellent
purpose
;
for
in
these
we
have
always
*NL*
taken
care
to
intersperse
somewhat
of
the
sour
or
acid
kind
,
in
order
*NL*
to
sharpen
and
stimulate
the
said
spirit
of
criticism
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
,
the
indolent
reader
,
as
well
as
spectator
,
finds
great
*NL*
advantage
from
both
these
;
for
,
as
they
are
not
obliged
either
to
see
*NL*
the
one
or
read
the
others
,
and
both
the
play
and
the
book
are
thus
*NL*
protracted
,
by
the
former
they
have
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
*NL*
allowed
them
to
sit
at
dinner
,
and
by
the
latter
they
have
the
*NL*
advantage
of
beginning
to
read
at
the
fourth
or
fifth
page
instead
of
*NL*
the
first
,
a
matter
by
no
means
of
trivial
consequence
to
persons
who
*NL*
read
books
with
no
other
view
than
to
say
they
have
read
them
,
a
more
*NL*
general
motive
to
reading
than
is
commonly
imagined
;
and
from
which
*NL*
not
only
law
books
,
and
good
books
,
but
the
pages
of
Homer
and
Virgil
,
*NL*
of
Swift
and
Cervantes
,
have
been
often
turned
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
other
are
the
emoluments
which
arise
from
both
these
,
but
they
*NL*
are
for
the
most
part
so
obvious
,
that
we
shall
not
at
present
stay
to
*NL*
enumerate
them
;
especially
since
it
occurs
to
us
that
the
principal
*NL*
merit
of
both
the
prologue
and
the
preface
is
that
they
be
short

Chapter
ii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
whimsical
adventure
which
befel
the
squire
,
with
the
distressed
*NL*
situation
of
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
now
convey
the
reader
to
Mr
Western
's
lodgings
,
which
were
in
*NL*
Piccadilly
,
where
he
was
placed
by
the
recommendation
of
the
landlord
*NL*
at
the
Hercules
Pillars
at
Hyde
Park
Corner
;
for
at
the
inn
,
which
was
*NL*
the
first
he
saw
on
his
arrival
in
town
,
he
placed
his
horses
,
and
in
*NL*
those
lodgings
,
which
were
the
first
he
heard
of
,
he
deposited
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
when
Sophia
alighted
from
the
hackney-coach
,
which
brought
her
*NL*
from
the
house
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
she
desired
to
retire
to
the
*NL*
apartment
provided
for
her
;
to
which
her
father
very
readily
agreed
,
*NL*
and
whither
he
attended
her
himself
.
A
short
dialogue
,
neither
very
*NL*
material
nor
pleasant
to
relate
minutely
,
then
passed
between
them
,
in
*NL*
which
he
pressed
her
vehemently
to
give
her
consent
to
the
marriage
*NL*
with
Blifil
,
who
,
as
he
acquainted
her
,
was
to
be
in
town
in
a
few
*NL*
days
;
but
,
instead
of
complying
,
she
gave
a
more
peremptory
and
*NL*
resolute
refusal
than
she
had
ever
done
before
.
This
so
incensed
her
*NL*
father
,
that
after
many
bitter
vows
,
that
he
would
force
her
to
have
*NL*
him
whether
she
would
or
no
,
he
departed
from
her
with
many
hard
words
*NL*
and
curses
,
locked
the
door
,
and
put
the
key
into
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Sophia
was
left
with
no
other
company
than
what
attend
the
*NL*
closest
state
prisoner
,
namely
,
fire
and
candle
,
the
squire
sat
down
*NL*
to
regale
himself
over
a
bottle
of
wine
,
with
his
parson
and
the
*NL*
landlord
of
the
Hercules
Pillars
,
who
,
as
the
squire
said
,
would
make
*NL*
an
excellent
third
man
,
and
could
inform
them
of
the
news
of
the
town
,
*NL*
and
how
affairs
went
;
for
to
be
sure
,
says
he
,
he
knows
a
great
deal
,
*NL*
since
the
horses
of
many
of
the
quality
stand
at
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
agreeable
society
Mr
Western
past
that
evening
and
great
part
*NL*
of
the
succeeding
day
,
during
which
period
nothing
happened
of
*NL*
sufficient
consequence
to
find
a
place
in
this
history
.
All
this
time
*NL*
Sophia
past
by
herself
;
for
her
father
swore
she
should
never
come
out
*NL*
of
her
chamber
alive
,
unless
she
first
consented
to
marry
Blifil
;
nor
*NL*
did
he
ever
suffer
the
door
to
be
unlocked
,
unless
to
convey
her
food
,
*NL*
on
which
occasions
he
always
attended
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
morning
after
his
arrival
,
while
he
and
the
parson
were
at
*NL*
breakfast
together
on
a
toast
and
tankard
,
he
was
informed
that
a
*NL*
gentleman
was
below
to
wait
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
gentleman
!
''
quoth
the
squire
,
``
who
the
devil
can
he
be
?
Do
,
doctor
,
*NL*
go
down
and
see
who
't
is
.
Mr
Blifil
can
hardly
be
come
to
town
*NL*
yet
.
--
Go
down
,
do
,
and
know
what
his
business
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
returned
with
an
account
that
it
was
a
very
well-drest
man
,
*NL*
and
by
the
ribbon
in
his
hat
he
took
him
for
an
officer
of
the
army
;
*NL*
that
he
said
he
had
some
particular
business
,
which
he
could
deliver
*NL*
to
none
but
Mr
Western
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
officer
!
''
cries
the
squire
;
``
what
can
any
such
fellow
have
to
do
*NL*
with
me
?
If
he
wants
an
order
for
baggage-waggons
,
I
am
no
justice
of
*NL*
peace
here
,
nor
can
I
grant
a
warrant
.
--
Let
un
come
up
then
,
if
he
*NL*
must
speak
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
genteel
man
now
entered
the
room
;
who
,
having
made
his
*NL*
compliments
to
the
squire
,
and
desired
the
favour
of
being
alone
with
*NL*
him
,
delivered
himself
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
I
come
to
wait
upon
you
by
the
command
of
my
Lord
Fellamar
;
but
*NL*
with
a
very
different
message
from
what
I
suppose
you
expect
,
after
*NL*
what
past
the
other
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lord
who
?
''
cries
the
squire
;
``
I
never
heard
the
name
o'un
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
lordship
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
``
is
willing
to
impute
everything
*NL*
to
the
effect
of
liquor
,
and
the
most
trifling
acknowledgment
of
that
*NL*
kind
will
set
everything
right
;
for
as
he
hath
the
most
violent
*NL*
attachment
to
your
daughter
,
you
,
sir
,
are
the
last
person
upon
earth
*NL*
from
whom
he
would
resent
an
affront
;
and
happy
is
it
for
you
both
*NL*
that
he
hath
given
such
public
demonstrations
of
his
courage
as
to
be
*NL*
able
to
put
up
an
affair
of
this
kind
without
danger
of
any
imputation
*NL*
on
his
honour
.
All
he
desires
,
therefore
,
is
,
that
you
will
before
me
*NL*
make
some
acknowledgment
;
the
slightest
in
the
world
will
be
*NL*
sufficient
;
and
he
intends
this
afternoon
to
pay
his
respects
to
you
,
*NL*
in
order
to
obtain
your
leave
of
visiting
the
young
lady
on
the
*NL*
footing
of
a
lover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
much
of
what
you
say
,
sir
,
''
said
the
squire
;
``
but
*NL*
I
suppose
,
by
what
you
talk
about
my
daughter
,
that
this
is
the
lord
*NL*
which
my
cousin
,
Lady
Bellaston
,
mentioned
to
me
,
and
said
something
*NL*
about
his
courting
my
daughter
.
If
so
be
that
how
that
be
the
*NL*
case
--
you
may
give
my
service
to
his
lordship
,
and
tell
un
the
girl
is
*NL*
disposed
of
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
sir
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
``
you
are
not
sufficiently
apprized
*NL*
of
the
greatness
of
this
offer
.
I
believe
such
a
person
,
title
,
and
*NL*
fortune
would
be
nowhere
refused
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lookee
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
squire
;
``
to
be
very
plain
,
my
daughter
is
*NL*
bespoke
already
;
but
if
she
was
not
,
I
would
not
marry
her
to
a
lord
*NL*
upon
any
account
;
I
hate
all
lords
;
they
are
a
parcel
of
courtiers
and
*NL*
Hanoverians
,
and
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
the
gentleman
,
``
if
that
is
your
resolution
,
the
*NL*
message
I
am
to
deliver
to
you
is
that
my
lord
desires
the
favour
of
*NL*
your
company
this
morning
in
Hyde
Park
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
tell
my
lord
,
''
answered
the
squire
,
``
that
I
am
busy
and
*NL*
can
not
come
.
I
have
enough
to
look
after
at
home
,
and
ca
n't
stir
*NL*
abroad
on
any
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
sir
,
''
quoth
the
other
,
``
you
are
too
much
a
gentleman
to
*NL*
send
such
a
message
;
you
will
not
,
I
am
convinced
,
have
it
said
of
*NL*
you
,
that
,
after
having
affronted
a
noble
peer
,
you
refuse
him
*NL*
satisfaction
.
His
lordship
would
have
been
willing
,
from
his
great
*NL*
regard
to
the
young
lady
,
to
have
made
up
matters
in
another
way
;
but
*NL*
unless
he
is
to
look
on
you
as
a
father
,
his
honour
will
not
suffer
*NL*
his
putting
up
such
an
indignity
as
you
must
be
sensible
you
offered
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
offered
him
!
''
cries
the
squire
;
``
it
is
a
d
--
n
'd
lie
!
I
never
*NL*
offered
him
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
these
words
the
gentleman
returned
a
very
short
verbal
rebuke
,
*NL*
and
this
he
accompanied
at
the
same
time
with
some
manual
*NL*
remonstrances
,
which
no
sooner
reached
the
ears
of
Mr
Western
,
than
*NL*
that
worthy
squire
began
to
caper
very
briskly
about
the
room
,
*NL*
bellowing
at
the
same
time
with
all
his
might
,
as
if
desirous
to
*NL*
summon
a
greater
number
of
spectators
to
behold
his
agility
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parson
,
who
had
left
great
part
of
the
tankard
unfinished
,
was
not
*NL*
retired
far
;
he
immediately
attended
therefore
on
the
squire
's
*NL*
vociferation
,
crying
,
``
Bless
me
!
sir
,
what
's
the
matter
?
''
--
``
Matter
!
''
*NL*
quoth
the
squire
,
``
here
's
a
highwayman
,
I
believe
,
who
wants
to
rob
*NL*
and
murder
me
--
for
he
hath
fallen
upon
me
with
that
stick
there
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
when
I
wish
I
may
be
d

n
'd
if
I
gid
un
the
least
provocation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
sir
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
did
you
not
tell
me
I
lyed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
as
I
hope
to
be
saved
,
''
answered
the
squire
,
''
--
I
believe
I
might
*NL*
say
,
'T
was
a
lie
that
I
had
offered
any
affront
to
my
lord
--
but
I
*NL*
never
said
the
word
,
`
you
lie
.
'
--
I
understand
myself
better
,
and
you
*NL*
might
have
understood
yourself
better
than
to
fall
upon
a
naked
man
.
*NL*
If
I
had
a
stick
in
my
hand
,
you
would
not
have
dared
strike
me
.
I
'd
*NL*
have
knocked
thy
lantern
jaws
about
thy
ears
.
Come
down
into
yard
this
*NL*
minute
,
and
I
'll
take
a
bout
with
thee
at
single
stick
for
a
broken
*NL*
head
,
that
I
will
;
or
I
will
go
into
naked
room
and
box
thee
for
a
*NL*
belly-full
.
At
unt
half
a
man
,
at
unt
,
I
'm
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
with
some
indignation
,
replied
,
``
I
see
,
sir
,
you
are
*NL*
below
my
notice
,
and
I
shall
inform
his
lordship
you
are
below
his
.
I
*NL*
am
sorry
I
have
dirtied
my
fingers
with
you
.
''
At
which
words
he
*NL*
withdrew
,
the
parson
interposing
to
prevent
the
squire
from
stopping
*NL*
him
,
in
which
he
easily
prevailed
,
as
the
other
,
though
he
made
some
*NL*
efforts
for
the
purpose
,
did
not
seem
very
violently
bent
on
success
.
*NL*
However
,
when
the
captain
was
departed
,
the
squire
sent
many
curses
*NL*
and
some
menaces
after
him
;
but
as
these
did
not
set
out
from
his
lips
*NL*
till
the
officer
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
,
and
grew
louder
and
*NL*
louder
as
he
was
more
and
more
remote
,
they
did
not
reach
his
ears
,
or
*NL*
at
least
did
not
retard
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Sophia
,
however
,
who
,
in
her
prison
,
heard
all
her
father
's
*NL*
outcries
from
first
to
last
,
began
now
first
to
thunder
with
her
foot
,
*NL*
and
afterwards
to
scream
as
loudly
as
the
old
gentleman
himself
had
*NL*
done
before
,
though
in
a
much
sweeter
voice
.
These
screams
soon
*NL*
silenced
the
squire
,
and
turned
all
his
consideration
towards
his
*NL*
daughter
,
whom
he
loved
so
tenderly
,
that
the
least
apprehension
of
*NL*
any
harm
happening
to
her
,
threw
him
presently
into
agonies
;
for
,
*NL*
except
in
that
single
instance
in
which
the
whole
future
happiness
of
*NL*
her
life
was
concerned
,
she
was
sovereign
mistress
of
his
*NL*
inclinations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
ended
his
rage
against
the
captain
,
with
swearing
he
would
take
*NL*
the
law
of
him
,
the
squire
now
mounted
upstairs
to
Sophia
,
whom
,
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
had
unlocked
and
opened
the
door
,
he
found
all
pale
and
*NL*
breathless
.
The
moment
,
however
,
that
she
saw
her
father
,
she
*NL*
collected
all
her
spirits
,
and
,
catching
him
hold
by
the
hand
,
she
*NL*
cryed
passionately
,
``
O
my
dear
sir
,
I
am
almost
frightened
to
death
!
I
*NL*
hope
to
heaven
no
harm
hath
happened
to
you
.
''
``
No
,
no

''
cries
the
*NL*
squire
,
``
no
great
harm

The
rascal
hath
not
hurt
me
much

``

she
,
``

insulted
you

``
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
the
name

''
answered
Western
;
``
some
officer
fellow

I
suppose

*NL*
that

are
to
pay

beating
us
;

I
'll
make
him
pay
this
bout

got
anything

I
suppose

hath
not

For
thof

drest
out

vine

I
question
whether

got
a
voot
of

``
But

sir

cries
she
,
``
what
was
the
occasion
of
your
*NL*
quarrel
?
''
``
What
should
it
be
,
Sophy
,
''
answered
the
squire
,
``
but
about
*NL*
you
,
Sophy
?
All
my
misfortunes
are
about
you
;
you
will
be
the
death
of
*NL*
your
poor
father
at
last
.
Here
's
a
varlet
of
a
lord
,
the
Lord
knows
*NL*
who
,
forsooth
!
who
hath
a
taan
a
liking
to
you
,
and
because
I
would
*NL*
not
gi
un
my
consent
,
he
sent
me
a
kallenge
.
Come
,
do
be
a
good
girl
,
*NL*
Sophy
,
and
put
an
end
to
all
your
father
's
troubles
;
come
,
do
consent
*NL*
to
ha
un
;
he
will
be
in
town
within
this
day
or
two
;
do
but
promise
me
*NL*
to
marry
un
as
soon
as
he
comes
,
and
you
will
make
me
the
happiest
man
*NL*
in
the
world
,
and
I
will
make
you
the
happiest
woman
;
you
shall
have
*NL*
the
finest
cloaths
in
London
,
and
the
finest
jewels
,
and
a
coach
and
*NL*
six
at
your
command
.
I
promised
Allworthy
already
to
give
up
half
my
*NL*
estate
--
od
rabbet
it
!
I
should
hardly
stick
at
giving
up
the
whole
.
''
*NL*
``
Will
my
papa
be
so
kind
,
''
says
she
,
``
as
to
hear
me
speak
?
''
--
``
Why
wout
*NL*
ask
,
Sophy
?
''
cries
he
,
``
when
dost
know
I
had
rather
hear
thy
voice
*NL*
than
the
musick
of
the
best
pack
of
dogs
in
England
.
--
Hear
thee
,
my
*NL*
dear
little
girl
!
I
hope
I
shall
hear
thee
as
long
as
I
live
;
for
if
I
*NL*
was
ever
to
lose
that
pleasure
,
I
would
not
gee
a
brass
varden
to
live
*NL*
a
moment
longer
.
Indeed
,
Sophy
,
you
do
not
know
how
I
love
you
,
indeed
*NL*
you
do
n't
,
or
you
never
could
have
run
away
and
left
your
poor
father
,
*NL*
who
hath
no
other
joy
,
no
other
comfort
upon
earth
,
but
his
little
*NL*
Sophy
.
''
At
these
words
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
;
and
Sophia
-LRB-
with
*NL*
the
tears
streaming
from
hers
-RRB-
answered
,
``
Indeed
,
my
dear
papa
,
I
know
*NL*
you
have
loved
me
tenderly
,
and
heaven
is
my
witness
how
sincerely
I
*NL*
have
returned
your
affection
;
nor
could
anything
but
an
apprehension
*NL*
of
being
forced
into
the
arms
of
this
man
have
driven
me
to
run
from
a
*NL*
father
whom
I
love
so
passionately
,
that
I
would
,
with
pleasure
,
*NL*
sacrifice
my
life
to
his
happiness
;
nay
,
I
have
endeavoured
to
reason
*NL*
myself
into
doing
more
,
and
had
almost
worked
up
a
resolution
to
*NL*
endure
the
most
miserable
of
all
lives
,
to
comply
with
your
*NL*
inclination
.
It
was
that
resolution
alone
to
which
I
could
not
force
*NL*
my
mind
;
nor
can
I
ever
.
''
Here
the
squire
began
to
look
wild
,
and
the
*NL*
foam
appeared
at
his
lips
,
which
Sophia
,
observing
,
begged
to
be
heard
*NL*
out
,
and
then
proceeded
:
``
If
my
father
's
life
,
his
health
,
or
any
real
*NL*
happiness
of
his
was
at
stake
,
here
stands
your
resolved
daughter
;
may
*NL*
heaven
blast
me
if
there
is
a
misery
I
would
not
suffer
to
preserve
*NL*
you
!
--
No
,
that
most
detested
,
most
loathsome
of
all
lots
would
I
*NL*
embrace
.
I
would
give
my
hand
to
Blifil
for
your
sake
.
''
--
``
I
tell
thee
,
*NL*
it
will
preserve
me
,
''
answers
the
father
;
``
it
will
give
me
health
,
*NL*
happiness
,
life
,
everything
.
--
Upon
my
soul
I
shall
die
if
dost
refuse
*NL*
me
;
I
shall
break
my
heart
,
I
shall
,
upon
my
soul
.
''
--
``
Is
it
possible
,
''
*NL*
says
she
,
``
you
can
have
such
a
desire
to
make
me
miserable
?
''
--
``
I
tell
*NL*
thee
noa

''
answered
he
loudly
,
``
d

me
if
there
is
a
thing
upon

*NL*
I
would
not
do
to
see
thee

''
--
``
And
will
not
my
dear
papa
allow
*NL*
me
to
have
the
least
knowledge
of
what
will
make
me
so

If
it
be
true
*NL*
that
happiness
consists
in
opinion
,
what
must
be
my
condition
,
when
I
*NL*
shall
think
myself
the
most
miserable
of
all
the
wretches
upon
earth
?
''
*NL*
``
Better
think
yourself
so
,
''
said
he
,
``
than
know
it
by
being
married
to
*NL*
a
poor
bastardly
vagabond
.
''
``
If
it
will
content
you
,
sir
,
''
said
*NL*
Sophia
,
``
I
will
give
you
the
most
solemn
promise
never
to
marry
him

*NL*
nor
any
other

lives
,
without
his
consent

Let
me
*NL*
dedicate
my
whole
life
to
your
service

let
me
be
again
your
poor

Sophy
,
and
my
whole
business

pleasure

as
it
hath
been
,
to
*NL*
please
and
divert
you
.
''
``
Lookee
,
Sophy
,
''
answered
the
squire
,
``
I
am
*NL*
not
to
be
choused
in
this
manner
.
Your
aunt
Western
would
then
have
*NL*
reason
to
think
me
the
fool
she
doth
.
No
,
no
,
Sophy
,
I
'd
have
you
to
*NL*
know
I
have
a
got
more
wisdom
,
and
know
more
of
the
world
,
than
to
*NL*
take
the
word
of
a
woman
in
a
matter
where
a
man
is
concerned
.
''
``
How
,
*NL*
sir
,
have
I
deserved
this
want
of
confidence
?
''
said
she
;
``
have
I
ever
*NL*
broke
a
single
promise
to
you
?
or
have
I
ever
been
found
guilty
of
a
*NL*
falsehood
from
my
cradle
?
''
``
Lookee
,
Sophy
,
''
cries
he
;
``
that
's
neither
*NL*
here
nor
there
.
I
am
determined
upon
this
match
,
and
have
him
you
*NL*
shall

D
--
n
me
if
shat
unt
,
though
dost
hang
*NL*
thyself
the
next
morning
.
''
At
repeating
which
words
he
clinched
his
*NL*
fist
,
knit
his
brows
,
bit
his
lips
,
and
thundered
so
loud
,
that
the
*NL*
poor
afflicted
,
terrified
Sophia
sunk
trembling
into
her
chair
,
and
,
*NL*
had
not
a
flood
of
tears
come
immediately
to
her
relief
,
perhaps
worse
*NL*
had
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Western
beheld
the
deplorable
condition
of
his
daughter
with
no
more
*NL*
contrition
or
remorse
than
the
turnkey
of
Newgate
feels
at
viewing
the
*NL*
agonies
of
a
tender
wife
,
when
taking
her
last
farewel
of
her
*NL*
condemned
husband
;
or
rather
he
looked
down
on
her
with
the
same
*NL*
emotions
which
arise
in
an
honest
fair
tradesman
,
who
sees
his
debtor
*NL*
dragged
to
prison
for
L10
,
which
,
though
a
just
debt
,
the
wretch
is
*NL*
wickedly
unable
to
pay
.
Or
,
to
hit
the
case
still
more
nearly
,
he
felt
*NL*
the
same
compunction
with
a
bawd
,
when
some
poor
innocent
,
whom
she
*NL*
hath
ensnared
into
her
hands
,
falls
into
fits
at
the
first
proposal
of
*NL*
what
is
called
seeing
company
.
Indeed
this
resemblance
would
be
exact
,
*NL*
was
it
not
that
the
bawd
hath
an
interest
in
what
she
doth
,
and
the
*NL*
father
,
though
perhaps
he
may
blindly
think
otherwise
,
can
,
in
*NL*
reality
,
have
none
in
urging
his
daughter
to
almost
an
equal
*NL*
prostitution
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
condition
he
left
his
poor
Sophia
,
and
,
departing
with
a
very
*NL*
vulgar
observation
on
the
effect
of
tears
,
he
locked
the
room
,
and
*NL*
returned
to
the
parson
,
who
said
everything
he
durst
in
behalf
of
the
*NL*
young
lady
,
which
,
though
perhaps
it
was
not
quite
so
much
as
his
duty
*NL*
required
,
yet
was
it
sufficient
to
throw
the
squire
into
a
violent
*NL*
rage
,
and
into
many
indecent
reflections
on
the
whole
body
of
the
*NL*
clergy
,
which
we
have
too
great
an
honour
for
that
sacred
function
to
*NL*
commit
to
paper
.

*NL*
Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
happened
to
Sophia
during
her
confinement
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
of
the
house
where
the
squire
lodged
had
begun
very
early
*NL*
to
entertain
a
strange
opinion
of
her
guests
.
However
,
as
she
was
*NL*
informed
that
the
squire
was
a
man
of
vast
fortune
,
and
as
she
had
*NL*
taken
care
to
exact
a
very
extraordinary
price
for
her
rooms
,
she
did
*NL*
not
think
proper
to
give
any
offence
;
for
,
though
she
was
not
without
*NL*
some
concern
for
the
confinement
of
poor
Sophia
,
of
whose
great
*NL*
sweetness
of
temper
and
affability
the
maid
of
the
house
had
made
so
*NL*
favourable
a
report
,
which
was
confirmed
by
all
the
squire
's
servants
,
*NL*
yet
she
had
much
more
concern
for
her
own
interest
than
to
provoke
*NL*
one
,
whom
,
as
she
said
,
she
perceived
to
be
a
very
hastish
kind
of
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Sophia
eat
but
little
,
yet
she
was
regularly
served
with
her
*NL*
meals
;
indeed
,
I
believe
,
if
she
had
liked
any
one
rarity
,
that
the
*NL*
squire
,
however
angry
,
would
have
spared
neither
pains
nor
cost
to
*NL*
have
procured
it
for
her
;
since
,
however
strange
it
may
appear
to
some
*NL*
of
my
readers
,
he
really
doated
on
his
daughter
,
and
to
give
her
any
*NL*
kind
of
pleasure
was
the
highest
satisfaction
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dinner-hour
being
arrived
,
Black
George
carried
her
up
a
pullet
,
*NL*
the
squire
himself
-LRB-
for
he
had
sworn
not
to
part
with
the
key
-RRB-
*NL*
attending
the
door
.
As
George
deposited
the
dish
,
some
compliments
*NL*
passed
between
him
and
Sophia
-LRB-
for
he
had
not
seen
her
since
she
left
*NL*
the
country
,
and
she
treated
every
servant
with
more
respect
than
some
*NL*
persons
shew
to
those
who
are
in
a
very
slight
degree
their
*NL*
inferiors
-RRB-
.
Sophia
would
have
had
him
take
the
pullet
back
,
saying
,
*NL*
she
could
not
eat
;
but
George
begged
her
to
try
,
and
particularly
*NL*
recommended
to
her
the
eggs
,
of
which
he
said
it
was
full
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
the
squire
was
waiting
at
the
door
;
but
George
was
a
*NL*
great
favourite
with
his
master
,
as
his
employment
was
in
concerns
of
*NL*
the
highest
nature
,
namely
,
about
the
game
,
and
was
accustomed
to
take
*NL*
many
liberties
.
He
had
officiously
carried
up
the
dinner
,
being
,
as
he
*NL*
said
,
very
desirous
to
see
his
young
lady
;
he
made
therefore
no
*NL*
scruple
of
keeping
his
master
standing
above
ten
minutes
,
while
*NL*
civilities
were
passing
between
him
and
Sophia
,
for
which
he
received
*NL*
only
a
good-humoured
rebuke
at
the
door
when
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eggs
of
pullets
,
partridges
,
pheasants
,
&
c.
,
were
,
as
George
well
*NL*
knew
,
the
most
favourite
dainties
of
Sophia
.
It
was
therefore
no
*NL*
wonder
that
he
,
who
was
a
very
good-natured
fellow
,
should
take
care
*NL*
to
supply
her
with
this
kind
of
delicacy
,
at
a
time
when
all
the
*NL*
servants
in
the
house
were
afraid
she
would
be
starved
;
for
she
had
*NL*
scarce
swallowed
a
single
morsel
in
the
last
forty
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
vexation
hath
not
the
same
effect
on
all
persons
as
it
usually
*NL*
hath
on
a
widow
,
whose
appetite
it
often
renders
sharper
than
it
can
*NL*
be
rendered
by
the
air
on
Bansted
Downs
,
or
Salisbury
Plain
;
yet
the
*NL*
sublimest
grief
,
notwithstanding
what
some
people
may
say
to
the
*NL*
contrary
,
will
eat
at
last
.
And
Sophia
,
herself
,
after
some
little
*NL*
consideration
,
began
to
dissect
the
fowl
,
which
she
found
to
be
as
*NL*
full
of
eggs
as
George
had
reported
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
if
she
was
pleased
with
these
,
it
contained
something
which
would
*NL*
have
delighted
the
Royal
Society
much
more
;
for
if
a
fowl
with
three
*NL*
legs
be
so
invaluable
a
curiosity
,
when
perhaps
time
hath
produced
a
*NL*
thousand
such
,
at
what
price
shall
we
esteem
a
bird
which
so
totally
*NL*
contradicts
all
the
laws
of
animal
oeconomy
,
as
to
contain
a
letter
in
*NL*
its
belly
?
Ovid
tells
us
of
a
flower
into
which
Hyacinthus
was
*NL*
metamorphosed
,
that
bears
letters
on
its
leaves
,
which
Virgil
*NL*
recommended
as
a
miracle
to
the
Royal
Society
of
his
day
;
but
no
age
*NL*
nor
nation
hath
ever
recorded
a
bird
with
a
letter
in
its
maw
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
a
miracle
of
this
kind
might
have
engaged
all
the
*NL*
_
Academies
des
Sciences
_
in
Europe
,
and
perhaps
in
a
fruitless
*NL*
enquiry
;
yet
the
reader
,
by
barely
recollecting
the
last
dialogue
*NL*
which
passed
between
Messieurs
Jones
and
Partridge
,
will
be
very
*NL*
easily
satisfied
from
whence
this
letter
came
,
and
how
it
found
its
*NL*
passage
into
the
fowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
notwithstanding
her
long
fast
,
and
notwithstanding
her
*NL*
favourite
dish
was
there
before
her
,
no
sooner
saw
the
letter
than
she
*NL*
immediately
snatched
it
up
,
tore
it
open
,
and
read
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
MADAM
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
not
sensible
to
whom
I
have
the
honour
of
writing
,
I
should
*NL*
endeavour
,
however
difficult
,
to
paint
the
horrors
of
my
mind
at
the
*NL*
account
brought
me
by
Mrs
Honour
;
but
as
tenderness
alone
can
have
*NL*
any
true
idea
of
the
pangs
which
tenderness
is
capable
of
feeling
,
*NL*
so
can
this
most
amiable
quality
,
which
my
Sophia
possesses
in
the
*NL*
most
eminent
degree
,
sufficiently
inform
her
what
her
Jones
must
*NL*
have
suffered
on
this
melancholy
occasion
.
Is
there
a
circumstance
*NL*
in
the
world
which
can
heighten
my
agonies
,
when
I
hear
of
any
*NL*
misfortune
which
hath
befallen

Surely
there
is
one
only

and
*NL*
with
that
I
am
accursed

It
is
,
my
Sophia
,
the
dreadful
*NL*
consideration
that
I
am
myself
the
wretched
cause
.
Perhaps
I
here
do
*NL*
myself
too
much
honour
,
but
none
will
envy
me
an
honour
which
costs
*NL*
me
so
extremely
dear
.
Pardon
me
this
presumption
,
and
pardon
me
a
*NL*
greater
still
,
if
I
ask
you
,
whether
my
advice
,
my
assistance
,
my
*NL*
presence
,
my
absence
,
my
death
,
or
my
tortures
can
bring
you
any
*NL*
relief
?
Can
the
most
perfect
admiration
,
the
most
watchful
*NL*
observance
,
the
most
ardent
love
,
the
most
melting
tenderness
,
the
*NL*
most
resigned
submission
to
your
will
,
make
you
amends
for
what
you
*NL*
are
to
sacrifice
to
my
happiness
?
If
they
can
,
fly
,
my
lovely
angel
,
*NL*
to
those
arms
which
are
ever
open
to
receive
and
protect
you
;
and
to
*NL*
which
,
whether
you
bring
yourself
alone
,
or
the
riches
of
the
world
*NL*
with
you
,
is
,
in
my
opinion
,
an
alternative
not
worth
regarding
.
If
,
*NL*
on
the
contrary
,
wisdom
shall
predominate
,
and
,
on
the
most
mature
*NL*
reflection
,
inform
you
,
that
the
sacrifice
is
too
great
;
and
if
*NL*
there
be
no
way
left
to
reconcile
your
father
,
and
restore
the
peace
*NL*
of
your
dear
mind
,
but
by
abandoning
me
,
I
conjure
you
drive
me
for
*NL*
ever
from
your
thoughts
,
exert
your
resolution
,
and
let
no
*NL*
compassion
for
my
sufferings
bear
the
least
weight
in
that
tender
*NL*
bosom
.
Believe
me
,
madam
,
I
so
sincerely
love
you
better
than
*NL*
myself
,
that
my
great
and
principal
end
is
your
happiness
.
My
first
*NL*
wish
-LRB-
why
would
not
fortune
indulge
me
in
it
?
-RRB-
was
,
and
pardon
me
if
*NL*
I
say
,
still
is
,
to
see
you
every
moment
the
happiest
of
women
;
my
*NL*
second
wish
is
,
to
hear
you
are
so
;
but
no
misery
on
earth
can
equal
*NL*
mine
,
while
I
think
you
owe
an
uneasy
moment
to
him
who
is
,
*NL*
*NL*
Madam
,
*NL*
in
every
sense
,
and
to
every
purpose
,
*NL*
your
devoted

What
Sophia
said
,
or
did
,
or
thought
,
upon
this
letter
,
how
often
she
*NL*
read
it
,
or
whether
more
than
once
,
shall
all
be
left
to
our
reader
's
*NL*
imagination
.
The
answer
to
it
he
may
perhaps
see
hereafter
,
but
not
at
*NL*
present
:
for
this
reason
,
among
others
,
that
she
did
not
now
write
*NL*
any
,
and
that
for
several
good
causes
,
one
of
which
was
this
,
she
had
*NL*
no
paper
,
pen
,
nor
ink
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
while
Sophia
was
meditating
on
the
letter
she
had
*NL*
received
,
or
on
something
else
,
a
violent
noise
from
below
disturbed
*NL*
her
meditations
.
This
noise
was
no
other
than
a
round
bout
at
*NL*
altercation
between
two
persons
.
One
of
the
combatants
,
by
his
voice
,
*NL*
she
immediately
distinguished
to
be
her
father
;
but
she
did
not
so
*NL*
soon
discover
the
shriller
pipes
to
belong
to
the
organ
of
her
aunt
*NL*
Western
,
who
was
just
arrived
in
town
,
where
having
,
by
means
of
one
*NL*
of
her
servants
,
who
stopt
at
the
Hercules
Pillars
,
learned
where
her
*NL*
brother
lodged
,
she
drove
directly
to
his
lodgings
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
therefore
take
our
leave
at
present
of
Sophia
,
and
,
with
our
*NL*
usual
good-breeding
,
attend
her
ladyship

The
squire
and
the
parson
-LRB-
for
the
landlord
was
now
otherwise
engaged
-RRB-
*NL*
were
smoaking
their
pipes
together
,
when
the
arrival
of
the
lady
was
*NL*
first
signified
.
The
squire
no
sooner
heard
her
name
,
than
he
*NL*
immediately
ran
down
to
usher
her
upstairs
;
for
he
was
a
great
*NL*
observer
of
such
ceremonials
,
especially
to
his
sister
,
of
whom
he
*NL*
stood
more
in
awe
than
of
any
other
human
creature
,
though
he
never
*NL*
would
own
this
,
nor
did
he
perhaps
know
it
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
,
on
her
arrival
in
the
dining-room
,
having
flung
herself
*NL*
into
a
chair
,
began
thus
to
harangue
:
``
Well
,
surely
,
no
one
ever
had
*NL*
such
an
intolerable
journey
.
I
think
the
roads
,
since
so
many
turnpike
*NL*
acts
,
are
grown
worse
than
ever
.
La
,
brother
,
how
could
you
get
into
*NL*
this
odious
place
?
no
person
of
condition
,
I
dare
swear
,
ever
set
foot
*NL*
here
before
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
cries
the
squire
,
``
I
think
they
do
well
*NL*
enough
;
it
was
landlord
recommended
them
.
I
thought
,
as
he
knew
most
*NL*
of
the
quality
,
he
could
best
shew
me
where
to
get
among
um
.
''
``
Well
,
*NL*
and
where
's
my
niece
?
''
says
the
lady
;
``
have
you
been
to
wait
upon
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
yet
?
''
``
Ay
,
ay
,
''
cries
the
squire
,
``
your
niece
is
safe
*NL*
enough
;
she
is
upstairs
in
chamber
.
''
``
How
!
''
answered
the
lady
,
``
is
my
*NL*
niece
in
this
house
,
and
does
she
not
know
of
my
being
here
?
''
``
No
,
*NL*
nobody
can
well
get
to
her
,
''
says
the
squire
,
``
for
she
is
under
lock
*NL*
and
key
.
I
have
her
safe
;
I
vetched
her
from
my
lady
cousin
the
first
*NL*
night
I
came
to
town
,
and
I
have
taken
care
o

her
ever

she
is
*NL*
as
secure
as
a
fox
in
a

I
promise
you

''
``
Good
heaven
!
''
returned
*NL*
Mrs
Western
,
``
what
do
I
hear
?
I
thought
what
a
fine
piece
of
work
*NL*
would
be
the
consequence
of
my
consent
to
your
coming
to
town
*NL*
yourself
;
nay
,
it
was
indeed
your
own
headstrong
will
,
nor
can
I
*NL*
charge
myself
with
having
ever
consented
to
it
.
Did
not
you
promise
*NL*
me
,
brother
,
that
you
would
take
none
of
these
headstrong
measures
?
*NL*
Was
it
not
by
these
headstrong
measures
that
you
forced
my
niece
to
*NL*
run
away
from
you
in
the
country
?
Have
you
a
mind
to
oblige
her
to
*NL*
take
such
another
step
?
''
``
Z
--
ds
and
the
devil
!
''
cries
the
squire
,
*NL*
dashing
his
pipe
on
the
ground
;
``
did
ever
mortal
hear
the
like
?
when
I
*NL*
expected
you
would
have
commended
me
for
all
I
have
done
,
to
be
fallen
*NL*
upon
in
this
manner
!
''
``
How
,
brother
!
''
said
the
lady
,
``
have
I
ever
*NL*
given
you
the
least
reason
to
imagine
I
should
commend
you
for
locking
*NL*
up
your
daughter
?
Have
I
not
often
told
you
that
women
in
a
free
*NL*
country
are
not
to
be
treated
with
such
arbitrary
power
?
We
are
as
*NL*
free
as
the
men
,
and
I
heartily
wish
I
could
not
say
we
deserve
that
*NL*
freedom
better
.
If
you
expect
I
should
stay
a
moment
longer
in
this
*NL*
wretched
house
,
or
that
I
should
ever
own
you
again
as
my
relation
,
or
*NL*
that
I
should
ever
trouble
myself
again
with
the
affairs
of
your
*NL*
family
,
I
insist
upon
it
that
my
niece
be
set
at
liberty
this
*NL*
instant

This
she
spoke
with
so
commanding
an
air
,
standing
with
her
*NL*
back
to
the
fire
,
with
one
hand
behind
her
,
and
a
pinch
of
snuff
in
*NL*
the
other
,
that
I
question
whether
Thalestris
,
at
the
head
of
her
*NL*
Amazons
,
ever
made
a
more
tremendous
figure
.
It
is
no
wonder
,
*NL*
therefore
,
that
the
poor
squire
was
not
proof
against
the
awe
which
*NL*
she
inspired
.
``
There
,
''
he
cried
,
throwing
down
the
key
,
``
there
it
is
,
*NL*
do
whatever
you
please

I
intended
only
to
have
kept
her
up
till
*NL*
Blifil
came
to
town
,
which
ca
n't
be
long
;
and
now
if
any
harm
happens
*NL*
in
the
mean
time
,
remember
who
is
to
be
blamed
for
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
answer

with

Mrs
Western
,
``

I

intermeddle

commit
the
whole
entirely

taking
any
one

now
having
summoned

show
her

she
departed

She
was
no

gone

than
the
squire

having
first
shut
the
door
-RRB-
*NL*
ejaculated
twenty
bitches
,

as
many
hearty
curses
against
her
,
not
*NL*
sparing
himself
for
having
ever
thought
of
her
estate

added
,
``
Now

one

I
am
down
for
it

The
parson
greatly
commended
this
resolution
:
and
now
the
squire
*NL*
having
ordered
in
another
bottle
,
which
was
his
usual
method
when
*NL*
anything
either
pleased
or
vexed
him
,
did
,
by
drinking
plentifully
of

this
medicinal
julap
,
so
totally
wash
away
his
choler

that
his
temper

become
perfectly
placid

serene

when
Mrs

returned
with

Sophia
into

The

Mrs

I

Why

the

``
I
have
not
the

answered
Mrs
Western

``
She
hath
*NL*
had
already
an
example
before
her

in
the
behaviour
of
that
wretch
*NL*
her

,
who
ruined
herself
by
neglecting
my
advice

O
*NL*
brother
,
what
think
you
?
You
was
hardly
gone
out
of
hearing
,
when
you
*NL*
set
out
for
London
,
when
who
should
arrive
but
that
impudent
fellow
*NL*
with
the
odious
Irish
name
--
that
Fitzpatrick
.
He
broke
in
abruptly
*NL*
upon
me
without
notice
,
or
I
would
not
have
seen
him
.
He
ran
on
a
*NL*
long
,
unintelligible
story
about
his
wife
,
to
which
he
forced
me
to
*NL*
give
him
a
hearing
;
but
I
made
him
very
little
answer
,
and
delivered
*NL*
him
the
letter
from
his
wife
,
which
I
bid
him
answer
himself

I
*NL*
suppose
the

endeavour

I
beg
you

I
am
determined
I

not

*NL*
*NL*
``

answered
the

;

And
now
Mrs
Western
,
luckily
for
Sophia

put
an
end
to
the

conversation
by
ordering
chairs
to
be
called

I
say
luckily
,
for
had
*NL*
it
continued
much
longer
,
fresh
matter
of
dissension
would
,
most
*NL*
probably
,
have
arisen
between
the
brother
and
sister
;
between
whom
*NL*
education
and
sex
made
the
only
difference
;
for
both
were
equally
*NL*
violent
and
equally
positive
:
they
had
both
a
vast
affection
for

Sophia
,
and
both
a
sovereign
contempt
for

The

that

greatly
*NL*
comforted
Jones
in
the
midst
of
all
the
anxiety
and
uneasiness
which
*NL*
he
had
suffered
on
the
account
of
Sophia
;
from
whom
,
by
the
means
of
*NL*
the
said
George
,
he
received
the
following
answer
to
his
letter
,
which
*NL*
Sophia
,
to
whom
the
use
of
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
was
restored
with
her
*NL*
liberty
,
wrote
the
very
evening
when
she
departed
from
her
*NL*
confinement
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
do
not
doubt
your
sincerity
in
what
you
write
,
you
will
be
*NL*
pleased
to
hear
that
some
of
my
afflictions
are
at
an
end
,
by
the
*NL*
arrival
of
my
aunt
Western
,
with
whom
I
am
at
present
,
and
with
whom
*NL*
I
enjoy
all
the
liberty
I
can
desire
.
One
promise
my
aunt
hath
*NL*
insisted
on
my
making
,
which
is
,
that
I
will
not
see
or
converse
*NL*
with
any
person
without
her
knowledge
and
consent
.
This
promise
I
*NL*
have
most
solemnly
given
,
and
shall
most
inviolably
keep
:
and
though
*NL*
she
hath
not
expressly
forbidden
me
writing
,
yet
that
must
be
an
*NL*
omission
from
forgetfulness
;
or
this
,
perhaps
,
is
included
in
the
*NL*
word
conversing
.
However
,
as
I
can
not
but
consider
this
as
a
breach
*NL*
of
her
generous
confidence
in
my
honour
,
you
can
not
expect
that
I
*NL*
shall
,
after
this
,
continue
to
write
myself
or
to
receive
letters
,
*NL*
without
her
knowledge
.
A
promise
is
with
me
a
very
sacred
thing
,
and
*NL*
to
be
extended
to
everything
understood
from
it
,
as
well
as
to
what
*NL*
is
expressed
by
it
;
and
this
consideration
may
,
perhaps
,
on
*NL*
reflection
,
afford
you
some
comfort
.
But
why
should
I
mention
a
*NL*
comfort
to
you
of
this
kind
;
for
though
there
is
one
thing
in
which
*NL*
I
can
never
comply
with
the
best
of
fathers
,
yet
am
I
firmly
*NL*
resolved
never
to
act
in
defiance
of
him
,
or
to
take
any
step
of
*NL*
consequence
without
his
consent
.
A
firm
persuasion
of
this
must
*NL*
teach
you
to
divert
your
thoughts
from
what
fortune
hath
-LRB-
perhaps
-RRB-
*NL*
made
impossible
.
This
your
own
interest
persuades
you
.
This
may
*NL*
reconcile
,
I
hope
,
Mr
Allworthy
to
you
;
and
if
it
will
,
you
have
my
*NL*
injunctions
to
pursue
it
.
Accidents
have
laid
some
obligations
on
*NL*
me
,
and
your
good
intentions
probably
more
.
Fortune
may
,
perhaps
,
be
*NL*
some
time
kinder
to
us
both
than
at
present
.
Believe
this
,
that
I
*NL*
shall
always
think
of
you
as
I
think
you
deserve
,
and
am
,
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
,
*NL*
your
obliged
humble
servant
,
*NL*
Sophia
Western
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
charge
you
write
to
me
no
more
--
at
present
at
least
;
and
accept
*NL*
this
,
which
is
now
of
no
service
to
me
,
which
I
know
you
must
want
,
*NL*
and
think
you
owe
the
trifle
only
to
that
fortune
by
which
you
found
*NL*
it
.

A
child
who
hath
just
learnt
his
letters
would
have
spelt
this
letter
*NL*
out
in
less
time
than
Jones
took
in
reading
it
.
The
sensations
it
*NL*
occasioned
were
a
mixture
of
joy
and
grief
;
somewhat
like
what
divide
*NL*
the
mind
of
a
good
man
when
he
peruses
the
will
of
his
deceased
*NL*
friend
,
in
which
a
large
legacy
,
which
his
distresses
make
the
more
*NL*
welcome
,
is
bequeathed
to
him
.
Upon
the
whole
,
however
,
he
was
more
*NL*
pleased
than
displeased
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
reader
may
probably
wonder
*NL*
that
he
was
displeased
at
all
;
but
the
reader
is
not
quite
so
much
in
*NL*
love
as
was
poor
Jones
;
and
love
is
a
disease
which
,
though
it
may
,
in
*NL*
some
instances
,
resemble
a
consumption
-LRB-
which
it
sometimes
causes
-RRB-
,
in
*NL*
others
proceeds
in
direct
opposition
to
it
,
and
particularly
in
this
,
*NL*
that
it
never
flatters
itself
,
or
sees
any
one
symptom
in
a
favourable
*NL*
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
gave
him
complete
satisfaction
,
which
was
,
that
his
mistress
*NL*
had
regained
her
liberty
,
and
was
now
with
a
lady
where
she
might
at
*NL*
least
assure
herself
of
a
decent
treatment
.
Another
comfortable
*NL*
circumstance
was
the
reference
which
she
made
to
her
promise
of
never
*NL*
marrying
any
other
man
;
for
however
disinterested
he
might
imagine
his
*NL*
passion
,
and
notwithstanding
all
the
generous
overtures
made
in
his
*NL*
letter
,
I
very
much
question
whether
he
could
have
heard
a
more
*NL*
afflicting
piece
of
news
than
that
Sophia
was
married
to
another
,
*NL*
though
the
match
had
been
never
so
great
,
and
never
so
likely
to
end
*NL*
in
making
her
completely
happy
.
That
refined
degree
of
Platonic
*NL*
affection
which
is
absolutely
detached
from
the
flesh
,
and
is
,
indeed
,
*NL*
entirely
and
purely
spiritual
,
is
a
gift
confined
to
the
female
part
*NL*
of
the
creation
;
many
of
whom
I
have
heard
declare
-LRB-
and
,
doubtless
,
*NL*
with
great
truth
-RRB-
,
that
they
would
,
with
the
utmost
readiness
,
resign
*NL*
a
lover
to
a
rival
,
when
such
resignation
was
proved
to
be
necessary
*NL*
for
the
temporal
interest
of
such
lover
.
Hence
,
therefore
,
I
conclude
*NL*
that
this
affection
is
in
nature
,
though
I
can
not
pretend
to
say
I
*NL*
have
ever
seen
an
instance
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
having
spent
three
hours
in
reading
and
kissing
the
aforesaid
*NL*
letter
,
and
being
,
at
last
,
in
a
state
of
good
spirits
,
from
the
*NL*
last-mentioned
considerations
,
he
agreed
to
carry
an
appointment
,
*NL*
which
he
had
before
made
,
into
execution
.
This
was
,
to
attend
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
,
and
her
younger
daughter
,
into
the
gallery
at
the
play-house
,
*NL*
and
to
admit
Mr
Partridge
as
one
of
the
company
.
For
as
Jones
had
*NL*
really
that
taste
for
humour
which
many
affect
,
he
expected
to
enjoy
*NL*
much
entertainment
in
the
criticisms
of
Partridge
,
from
whom
he
*NL*
expected
the
simple
dictates
of
nature
,
unimproved
,
indeed
,
but
*NL*
likewise
unadulterated
,
by
art
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
row
then
of
the
first
gallery
did
Mr
Jones
,
Mrs
Miller
,
*NL*
her
youngest
daughter
,
and
Partridge
,
take
their
places
.
Partridge
*NL*
immediately
declared
it
was
the
finest
place
he
had
ever
been
in
.
When
*NL*
the
first
music
was
played
,
he
said
,
``
It
was
a
wonder
how
so
many
*NL*
fiddlers
could
play
at
one
time
,
without
putting
one
another
out
.
''
*NL*
While
the
fellow
was
lighting
the
upper
candles
,
he
cried
out
to
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
,
``
Look
,
look
,
madam
,
the
very
picture
of
the
man
in
the
end
of
*NL*
the
common-prayer
book
before
the
gunpowder-treason
service
.
''
Nor
*NL*
could
he
help
observing
,
with
a
sigh
,
when
all
the
candles
were
*NL*
lighted
,
``
That
here
were
candles
enough
burnt
in
one
night
,
to
keep
an
*NL*
honest
poor
family
for
a
whole
twelvemonth
.

*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
play
,
which
was
Hamlet
,
Prince
of
Denmark
,
began
,
*NL*
Partridge
was
all
attention
,
nor
did
he
break
silence
till
the
*NL*
entrance
of
the
ghost
;
upon
which
he
asked
Jones
,
``
What
man
that
was
*NL*
in
the
strange
dress
;
something
,
''
said
he
,
``
like
what
I
have
seen
in
a
*NL*
picture
.
Sure
it
is
not
armour
,
is
it
?
''
Jones
answered
,
``
That
is
the
*NL*
ghost
.
''
To
which
Partridge
replied
with
a
smile
,
``
Persuade
me
to
that
,
*NL*
sir
,
if
you
can
.
Though
I
ca
n't
say
I
ever
actually
saw
a
ghost
in
my
*NL*
life
,
yet
I
am
certain
I
should
know
one
,
if
I
saw
him
,
better
than
*NL*
that
comes
to
.
No
,
no
,
sir
,
ghosts
do
n't
appear
in
such
dresses
as
*NL*
that
,
neither
.
''
In
this
mistake
,
which
caused
much
laughter
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
Partridge
,
he
was
suffered
to
continue
,
till
the
*NL*
scene
between
the
ghost
and
Hamlet
,
when
Partridge
gave
that
credit
to
*NL*
Mr
Garrick
,
which
he
had
denied
to
Jones
,
and
fell
into
so
violent
a
*NL*
trembling
,
that
his
knees
knocked
against
each
other
.
Jones
asked
him
*NL*
what
was
the
matter
,
and
whether
he
was
afraid
of
the
warrior
upon
the
*NL*
stage
?
``
O
la
!
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
perceive
now
it
is
what
you
told
me
.
I
*NL*
am
not
afraid
of
anything
;
for
I
know
it
is
but
a
play
.
And
if
it
was
*NL*
really
a
ghost
,
it
could
do
one
no
harm
at
such
a
distance
,
and
in
so
*NL*
much
company
;
and
yet
if
I
was
frightened
,
I
am
not
the
only
person
.
''
*NL*
``
Why
,
who
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
dost
thou
take
to
be
such
a
coward
here
*NL*
besides
thyself
?
''
``
Nay
,
you
may
call
me
coward
if
you
will
;
but
if
*NL*
that
little
man
there
upon
the
stage
is
not
frightened
,
I
never
saw
*NL*
any
man
frightened
in
my
life

Ay

go
along

;
*NL*
farther
than
I
'd
have
gone
for
all
the
king
's
dominions
.
''
Jones
*NL*
offered
to
speak
,
but
Partridge
cried
``
Hush
,
hush
!
dear
sir
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
hear
him
?
''
And
during
the
whole
speech
of
the
ghost
,
he
sat
with
his
*NL*
eyes
fixed
partly
on
the
ghost
and
partly
on
Hamlet
,
and
with
his
*NL*
mouth
open
;
the
same
passions
which
succeeded
each
other
in
Hamlet
,
*NL*
succeeding
likewise
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
scene
was
over
Jones
said
,
``
Why
,
Partridge
,
you
exceed
my
*NL*
expectations
.
You
enjoy
the
play
more
than
I
conceived
possible
.
''
*NL*
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
answered
Partridge
,
``
if
you
are
not
afraid
of
the
devil
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
help
it
;
but
to
be
sure
,
it
is
natural
to
be
surprized
at
such
*NL*
things
,
though
I
know
there
is
nothing
in
them
:
not
that
it
was
the
*NL*
ghost
that
surprized
me
,
neither
;
for
I
should
have
known
that
to
have
*NL*
been
only
a
man
in
a
strange
dress
;
but
when
I
saw
the
little
man
so
*NL*
frightened
himself
,
it
was
that
which
took
hold
of
me
.
''
``
And
dost
thou
*NL*
imagine
,
then
,
Partridge
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
that
he
was
really
*NL*
frightened
?
''
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
said
Partridge
,
``
did
not
you
yourself
observe
*NL*
afterwards
,
when
he
found
it
was
his
own
father
's
spirit
,
and
how
he
*NL*
was
murdered
in
the
garden
,
how
his
fear
forsook
him
by
degrees
,
and
*NL*
he
was
struck
dumb
with
sorrow
,
as
it
were
,
just
as
I
should
have
*NL*
been
,
had
it
been
my
own
case
?
--
But
hush
!
O
la
!
what
noise
is
that
?
*NL*
There
he
is
again
.
--
Well
,
to
be
certain
,
though
I
know
there
is
*NL*
nothing
at
all
in
it
,
I
am
glad
I
am
not
down
yonder
,
where
those
men
*NL*
are
.
''
Then
turning
his
eyes
again
upon
Hamlet
,
``
Ay
,
you
may
draw
your
*NL*
sword
;
what
signifies
a
sword
against
the
power
of
the
devil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
second
act
,
Partridge
made
very
few
remarks
.
He
greatly
*NL*
admired
the
fineness
of
the
dresses
;
nor
could
he
help
observing
upon
*NL*
the
king
's
countenance
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
how
people
may
be
deceived
*NL*
by
faces
!
_
Nulla
fides
fronti
_
is
,
I
find
,
a
true
saying
.
Who
would
*NL*
think
,
by
looking
in
the
king
's
face
,
that
he
had
ever
committed
a
*NL*
murder
?
''
He
then
enquired
after
the
ghost
;
but
Jones
,
who
intended
he
*NL*
should
be
surprized
,
gave
him
no
other
satisfaction
,
than
,
``
that
he
*NL*
might
possibly
see
him
again
soon
,
and
in
a
flash
of
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
sat
in
a
fearful
expectation
of
this
;
and
now
,
when
the
*NL*
ghost
made
his
next
appearance
,
Partridge
cried
out
,
``
There
,
sir
,
now
;
*NL*
what
say
you
now
?
is
he
frightened
now
or
no
?
As
much
frightened
as
*NL*
you
think
me
,
and
,
to
be
sure
,
nobody
can
help
some
fears
.
I
would
not
*NL*
be
in
so
bad
a
condition
as
what
's
his
name
,
squire
Hamlet
,
is
there
,
*NL*
for
all
the
world
.
Bless
me
!
what
's
become
of
the
spirit
?
As
I
am
a
*NL*
living
soul
,
I
thought
I
saw
him
sink
into
the
earth
.
''
``
Indeed
,
you
*NL*
saw
right
,
''
answered
Jones
.
``
Well
,
well
,
''
cries
Partridge
,
``
I
know
it
*NL*
is
only
a
play
:
and
besides
,
if
there
was
anything
in
all
this
,
Madam
*NL*
Miller
would
not
laugh
so
;
for
as
to
you
,
sir
,
you
would
not
be
*NL*
afraid
,
I
believe
,
if
the
devil
was
here
in
person
.
--
There
,
there
--
Ay
,
*NL*
no
wonder
you
are
in
such
a
passion
,
shake
the
vile
wicked
wretch
to
*NL*
pieces
.
If
she
was
my
own
mother
,
I
would
serve
her
so
.
To
be
sure
all
*NL*
duty
to
a
mother
is
forfeited
by
such
wicked
doings
.
--
Ay
,
go
about
*NL*
your
business
,
I
hate
the
sight
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Our
critic
was
now
pretty
silent
till
the
play
,
which
Hamlet
*NL*
introduces
before
the
king
.
This
he
did
not
at
first
understand
,
till
*NL*
Jones
explained
it
to
him
;
but
he
no
sooner
entered
into
the
spirit
of
*NL*
it
,
than
he
began
to
bless
himself
that
he
had
never
committed
murder
.
*NL*
Then
turning
to
Mrs
Miller
,
he
asked
her
,
``
If
she
did
not
imagine
the
*NL*
king
looked
as
if
he
was
touched
;
though
he
is
,
''
said
he
,
``
a
good
*NL*
actor
,
and
doth
all
he
can
to
hide
it
.
Well
,
I
would
not
have
so
much
*NL*
to
answer
for
,
as
that
wicked
man
there
hath
,
to
sit
upon
a
much
*NL*
higher
chair
than
he
sits
upon
.
No
wonder
he
ran
away
;
for
your
sake
*NL*
I
'll
never
trust
an
innocent
face
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave-digging
scene
next
engaged
the
attention
of
Partridge
,
who
*NL*
expressed
much
surprize
at
the
number
of
skulls
thrown
upon
the
stage
.
*NL*
To
which
Jones
answered
,
``
That
it
was
one
of
the
most
famous
*NL*
burial-places
about
town
.
''
``
No
wonder
then
,
''
cries
Partridge
,
``
that
*NL*
the
place
is
haunted
.
But
I
never
saw
in
my
life
a
worse
grave-digger
.
*NL*
I
had
a
sexton
,
when
I
was
clerk
,
that
should
have
dug
three
graves
*NL*
while
he
is
digging
one
.
The
fellow
handles
a
spade
as
if
it
was
the
*NL*
first
time
he
had
ever
had
one
in
his
hand
.
Ay
,
ay
,
you
may
sing
.
You
*NL*
had
rather
sing
than
work
,
I
believe
.
''
--
Upon
Hamlet
's
taking
up
the
*NL*
skull
,
he
cried
out
,
``
Well
!
it
is
strange
to
see
how
fearless
some
men
*NL*
are
:
I
never
could
bring
myself
to
touch
anything
belonging
to
a
dead
*NL*
man
,
on
any
account
.
--
He
seemed
frightened
enough
too
at
the
ghost
,
I
*NL*
thought
.
_
Nemo
omnibus
horis
sapit
.
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
Little
more
worth
remembering
occurred
during
the
play
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
which
Jones
asked
him
,
``
Which
of
the
players
he
had
liked
best
?
''
To
*NL*
this
he
answered
,
with
some
appearance
of
indignation
at
the
question
,
*NL*
``
The
king
,
without
doubt
.
''
``
Indeed
,
Mr
Partridge
,
''
says
Mrs
Miller
,
*NL*
``
you
are
not
of
the
same
opinion
with
the
town
;
for
they
are
all
*NL*
agreed
,
that
Hamlet
is
acted
by
the
best
player
who
ever
was
on
the
*NL*
stage
.
''
``
He
the
best
player
!
''
cries
Partridge
,
with
a
contemptuous
*NL*
sneer
,
``
why
,
I
could
act
as
well
as
he
myself
.
I
am
sure
,
if
I
had
*NL*
seen
a
ghost
,
I
should
have
looked
in
the
very
same
manner
,
and
done
*NL*
just
as
he
did
.
And
then
,
to
be
sure
,
in
that
scene
,
as
you
called
it
,
*NL*
between
him
and
his
mother
,
where
you
told
me
he
acted
so
fine
,
why
,
*NL*
Lord
help
me
,
any
man
,
that
is
,
any
good
man
,
that
had
such
a
mother
,
*NL*
would
have
done
exactly
the
same
.
I
know
you
are
only
joking
with
me
;
*NL*
but
indeed
,
madam
,
though
I
was
never
at
a
play
in
London
,
yet
I
have
*NL*
seen
acting
before
in
the
country
;
and
the
king
for
my
money
;
he
*NL*
speaks
all
his
words
distinctly
,
half
as
loud
again
as
the
*NL*
other
.
--
Anybody
may
see
he
is
an
actor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Mrs
Miller
was
thus
engaged
in
conversation
with
Partridge
,
a
*NL*
lady
came
up
to
Mr
Jones
,
whom
he
immediately
knew
to
be
Mrs
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
.
She
said
,
she
had
seen
him
from
the
other
part
of
the
*NL*
gallery
,
and
had
taken
that
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
,
as
she
had
*NL*
something
to
say
,
which
might
be
of
great
service
to
himself
.
She
then
*NL*
acquainted
him
with
her
lodgings
,
and
made
him
an
appointment
the
next
*NL*
day
in
the
morning
;
which
,
upon
recollection
,
she
presently
changed
to
*NL*
the
afternoon
;
at
which
time
Jones
promised
to
attend
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
the
adventure
at
the
playhouse
;
where
Partridge
had
*NL*
afforded
great
mirth
,
not
only
to
Jones
and
Mrs
Miller
,
but
to
all
who
*NL*
sat
within
hearing
,
who
were
more
attentive
to
what
he
said
,
than
to
*NL*
anything
that
passed
on
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
durst
not
go
to
bed
all
that
night
,
for
fear
of
the
ghost
;
and
for
*NL*
many
nights
after
sweated
two
or
three
hours
before
he
went
to
sleep
,
*NL*
with
the
same
apprehensions
,
and
waked
several
times
in
great
horrors
,
*NL*
crying
out
,
``
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
there
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
the
history
is
obliged
to
look
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
almost
impossible
for
the
best
parent
to
observe
an
exact
*NL*
impartiality
to
his
children
,
even
though
no
superior
merit
should
*NL*
bias
his
affection
;
but
sure
a
parent
can
hardly
be
blamed
,
when
that
*NL*
superiority
determines
his
preference
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
regard
all
the
personages
of
this
history
in
the
light
of
my
*NL*
children
;
so
I
must
confess
the
same
inclination
of
partiality
to
*NL*
Sophia
;
and
for
that
I
hope
the
reader
will
allow
me
the
same
excuse
,
*NL*
from
the
superiority
of
her
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
extraordinary
tenderness
which
I
have
for
my
heroine
never
*NL*
suffers
me
to
quit
her
any
long
time
without
the
utmost
reluctance
.
I
*NL*
could
now
,
therefore
,
return
impatiently
to
enquire
what
hath
happened
*NL*
to
this
lovely
creature
since
her
departure
from
her
father
's
,
but
*NL*
that
I
am
obliged
first
to
pay
a
short
visit
to
Mr
Blifil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Western
,
in
the
first
confusion
into
which
his
mind
was
cast
upon
*NL*
the
sudden
news
he
received
of
his
daughter
,
and
in
the
first
hurry
to
*NL*
go
after
her
,
had
not
once
thought
of
sending
any
account
of
the
*NL*
discovery
to
Blifil
.
He
had
not
gone
far
,
however
,
before
he
*NL*
recollected
himself
,
and
accordingly
stopt
at
the
very
first
inn
he
*NL*
came
to
,
and
dispatched
away
a
messenger
to
acquaint
Blifil
with
his
*NL*
having
found
Sophia
,
and
with
his
firm
resolution
to
marry
her
to
him
*NL*
immediately
,
if
he
would
come
up
after
him
to
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
love
which
Blifil
had
for
Sophia
was
of
that
violent
kind
,
*NL*
which
nothing
but
the
loss
of
her
fortune
,
or
some
such
accident
,
*NL*
could
lessen
,
his
inclination
to
the
match
was
not
at
all
altered
by
*NL*
her
having
run
away
,
though
he
was
obliged
to
lay
this
to
his
own
*NL*
account
.
He
very
readily
,
therefore
,
embraced
this
offer
.
Indeed
,
he
*NL*
now
proposed
the
gratification
of
a
very
strong
passion
besides
*NL*
avarice
,
by
marrying
this
young
lady
,
and
this
was
hatred
;
for
he
*NL*
concluded
that
matrimony
afforded
an
equal
opportunity
of
satisfying
*NL*
either
hatred
or
love
;
and
this
opinion
is
very
probably
verified
by
*NL*
much
experience
.
To
say
the
truth
,
if
we
are
to
judge
by
the
ordinary
*NL*
behaviour
of
married
persons
to
each
other
,
we
shall
perhaps
be
apt
to
*NL*
conclude
that
the
generality
seek
the
indulgence
of
the
former
passion
*NL*
only
,
in
their
union
of
everything
but
of
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
difficulty
,
however
,
in
his
way
,
and
this
arose
from
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
.
That
good
man
,
when
he
found
by
the
departure
of
Sophia
*NL*
-LRB-
for
neither
that
,
nor
the
cause
of
it
,
could
be
concealed
from
him
-RRB-
,
*NL*
the
great
aversion
which
she
had
for
his
nephew
,
began
to
be
seriously
*NL*
concerned
that
he
had
been
deceived
into
carrying
matters
so
far
.
He
*NL*
by
no
means
concurred
with
the
opinion
of
those
parents
,
who
think
it
*NL*
as
immaterial
to
consult
the
inclinations
of
their
children
in
the
*NL*
affair
of
marriage
,
as
to
solicit
the
good
pleasure
of
their
servants
*NL*
when
they
intend
to
take
a
journey
;
and
who
are
by
law
,
or
decency
at
*NL*
least
,
withheld
often
from
using
absolute
force
.
On
the
contrary
,
as
*NL*
he
esteemed
the
institution
to
be
of
the
most
sacred
kind
,
he
thought
*NL*
every
preparatory
caution
necessary
to
preserve
it
holy
and
inviolate
;
*NL*
and
very
wisely
concluded
,
that
the
surest
way
to
effect
this
was
by
*NL*
laying
the
foundation
in
previous
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
indeed
soon
cured
his
uncle
of
all
anger
on
the
score
of
*NL*
deceit
,
by
many
vows
and
protestations
that
he
had
been
deceived
*NL*
himself
,
with
which
the
many
declarations
of
Western
very
well
*NL*
tallied
;
but
now
to
persuade
Allworthy
to
consent
to
the
renewing
his
*NL*
addresses
was
a
matter
of
such
apparent
difficulty
,
that
the
very
*NL*
appearance
was
sufficient
to
have
deterred
a
less
enterprizing
genius
;
*NL*
but
this
young
gentleman
so
well
knew
his
own
talents
,
that
nothing
*NL*
within
the
province
of
cunning
seemed
to
him
hard
to
be
achieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
then
he
represented
the
violence
of
his
own
affection
,
and
the
*NL*
hopes
of
subduing
aversion
in
the
lady
by
perseverance
.
He
begged
*NL*
that
,
in
an
affair
on
which
depended
all
his
future
repose
,
he
might
*NL*
at
least
be
at
liberty
to
try
all
fair
means
for
success
.
Heaven
*NL*
forbid
,
he
said
,
that
he
should
ever
think
of
prevailing
by
any
other
*NL*
than
the
most
gentle
methods
!
``
Besides
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
if
they
fail
,
*NL*
you
may
then
-LRB-
which
will
be
surely
time
enough
-RRB-
deny
your
consent
.
''
He
*NL*
urged
the
great
and
eager
desire
which
Mr
Western
had
for
the
match
;
*NL*
and
lastly
,
he
made
great
use
of
the
name
of
Jones
,
to
whom
he
imputed
*NL*
all
that
had
happened
;
and
from
whom
,
he
said
,
to
preserve
so
valuable
*NL*
a
young
lady
was
even
an
act
of
charity
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
arguments
were
well
seconded
by
Thwackum
,
who
dwelt
a
little
*NL*
stronger
on
the
authority
of
parents
than
Mr
Blifil
himself
had
done
.
*NL*
He
ascribed
the
measures
which
Mr
Blifil
was
desirous
to
take
to
*NL*
Christian
motives
;
``
and
though
,
''
says
he
,
``
the
good
young
gentleman
*NL*
hath
mentioned
charity
last
,
I
am
almost
convinced
it
is
his
first
and
*NL*
principal
consideration
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Square
,
possibly
,
had
he
been
present
,
would
have
sung
to
the
same
*NL*
tune
,
though
in
a
different
key
,
and
would
have
discovered
much
moral
*NL*
fitness
in
the
proceeding
:
but
he
was
now
gone
to
Bath
for
the
*NL*
recovery
of
his
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
,
though
not
without
reluctance
,
at
last
yielded
to
the
*NL*
desires
of
his
nephew
.
He
said
he
would
accompany
him
to
London
,
where
*NL*
he
might
be
at
liberty
to
use
every
honest
endeavour
to
gain
the
lady
:
*NL*
``
But
I
declare
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
will
never
give
my
consent
to
any
*NL*
absolute
force
being
put
on
her
inclinations
,
nor
shall
you
ever
have
*NL*
her
,
unless
she
can
be
brought
freely
to
compliance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
did
the
affection
of
Allworthy
for
his
nephew
betray
the
superior
*NL*
understanding
to
be
triumphed
over
by
the
inferior
;
and
thus
is
the
*NL*
prudence
of
the
best
of
heads
often
defeated
by
the
tenderness
of
the
*NL*
best
of
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
,
having
obtained
this
unhoped-for
acquiescence
in
his
uncle
,
*NL*
rested
not
till
he
carried
his
purpose
into
execution
.
And
as
no
*NL*
immediate
business
required
Mr
Allworthy
's
presence
in
the
country
,
*NL*
and
little
preparation
is
necessary
to
men
for
a
journey
,
they
set
out
*NL*
the
very
next
day
,
and
arrived
in
town
that
evening
,
when
Mr
Jones
,
as
*NL*
we
have
seen
,
was
diverting
himself
with
Partridge
at
the
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
after
his
arrival
Mr
Blifil
waited
on
Mr
Western
,
by
whom
*NL*
he
was
most
kindly
and
graciously
received
,
and
from
whom
he
had
every
*NL*
possible
assurance
-LRB-
perhaps
more
than
was
possible
-RRB-
that
he
should
*NL*
very
shortly
be
as
happy
as
Sophia
could
make
him
;
nor
would
the
*NL*
squire
suffer
the
young
gentleman
to
return
to
his
uncle
till
he
had
,
*NL*
almost
against
his
will
,
carried
him
to
his
sister
.

Chapter
vii

*NL*
*NL*
In
which
Mr
Western
pays
a
visit
to
his
sister
,
in
company
with
Mr
*NL*
Blifil
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
was
reading
a
lecture
on
prudence
,
and
matrimonial
*NL*
politics
,
to
her
niece
,
when
her
brother
and
Blifil
broke
in
with
less
*NL*
ceremony
than
the
laws
of
visiting
require
.
Sophia
no
sooner
saw
*NL*
Blifil
than
she
turned
pale
,
and
almost
lost
the
use
of
all
her
*NL*
faculties
;
but
her
aunt
,
on
the
contrary
,
waxed
red
,
and
,
having
all
*NL*
her
faculties
at
command
,
began
to
exert
her
tongue
on
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
am
astonished
at
your
behaviour
;
will
you
*NL*
never
learn
any
regard
to
decorum
?
Will
you
still
look
upon
every
*NL*
apartment
as
your
own
,
or
as
belonging
to
one
of
your
country
tenants
?
*NL*
Do
you
think
yourself
at
liberty
to
invade
the
privacies
of
women
of
*NL*
condition
,
without
the
least
decency
or
notice
?
''
--
``
Why
,
what
a
pox
*NL*
is
the
matter
now
?
''
quoth
the
squire
;
``
one
would
think
I
had
caught
*NL*
you
at
--
''
--
``
None
of
your
brutality
,
sir
,
I
beseech
you
,
''
answered
*NL*
she
.
--
``
You
have
surprized
my
poor
niece
so
,
that
she
can
hardly
,
I
*NL*
see
,
support
herself
.
--
Go
,
my
dear
,
retire
,
and
endeavour
to
recruit
*NL*
your
spirits
;
for
I
see
you
have
occasion
.
''
At
which
words
Sophia
,
who
*NL*
never
received
a
more
welcome
command
,
hastily
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
sister
,
''
cries
the
squire
,
``
you
are
mad
,
when
I
have
*NL*
brought
Mr
Blifil
here
to
court
her
,
to
force
her
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
brother
,
''
says
she
,
``
you
are
worse
than
mad
,
when
you
know
in
*NL*
what
situation
affairs
are
,
to

I
am
sure
I
ask
Mr
Blifil
's
pardon
,
*NL*
but
he
knows
very
well
to
whom
to
impute
so
disagreeable
a
reception
.
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
I
am
sure
I
shall
always
be
very
glad
to
see
Mr
*NL*
Blifil
;
but
his
own
good
sense
would
not
have
suffered
him
to
proceed
*NL*
so
abruptly
,
had
you
not
compelled
him
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
bowed
and
stammered
,
and
looked
like
a
fool
;
but
Western
,
*NL*
without
giving
him
time
to
form
a
speech
for
the
purpose
,
answered
,
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
I
am
to
blame
,
if
you
will
,
I
always
am
,
certainly
;
but
*NL*
come
,
let
the
girl
be
fetched
back
again
,
or
let
Mr
Blifil
go
to
*NL*
her
.
--
He
's
come
up
on
purpose
,
and
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
''
cries
Mrs
Western
,
``
Mr
Blifil
,
I
am
confident
,
understands
*NL*
himself
better
than
to
think
of
seeing
my
niece
any
more
this
morning
,
*NL*
after
what
hath
happened
.
Women
are
of
a
nice
contexture
;
and
our
*NL*
spirits
,
when
disordered
,
are
not
to
be
recomposed
in
a
moment
.
Had
*NL*
you
suffered
Mr
Blifil
to
have
sent
his
compliments
to
my
niece
,
and
*NL*
to
have
desired
the
favour
of
waiting
on
her
in
the
afternoon
,
I
*NL*
should
possibly
have
prevailed
on
her
to
have
seen
him
;
but
now
I
*NL*
despair
of
bringing
about
any
such
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry

madam

cried
Blifil
,
``
that
Mr
Western
's
*NL*
extraordinary
kindness
to
me

which
I
can
never
enough
acknowledge
,
*NL*
should
have
occasioned

''
``
Indeed

said
she
,
interrupting
him
,
*NL*
``
you
need
make
no
apologies

we
all
know

so
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
what
anybody
knows

answered
the
squire
;

``

when
must
he
come
to
see
her

I
tell
you

come
*NL*
up
on
purpose

so
is
Allworthy

``

said
she
,
``
whatever
*NL*
message
Mr
Blifil
thinks
proper

delivered

I
suppose
she

want
no

convinced

not

at
a
proper

``
The
devil

answered
the
*NL*
squire
.

``
Odsbud
!

Do
n't
we
know

I
say
nothing
,
but
some

wiser

all
the
world

--
If
I
might
have
had
my
will
,
she
had
not
*NL*
run
away
before
:
and
now
I
expect
to
hear
every
moment
she
is
guone
*NL*
again

For
as
great
a
fool
as
some
volk
think
me
,
I
know
very
well
*NL*
she
hates
--
''
``
No
matter
,
brother
,
''
replied
Mrs
Western
,
``
I
will
not
*NL*
hear
my
niece
abused
.
It
is
a
reflection
on
my
family
.
She
is
an
*NL*
honour
to
it
;
and
she
will
be
an
honour
to
it
,
I
promise
you
.
I
will
*NL*
pawn
my
whole
reputation
in
the
world
on
her
conduct
.
--
I
shall
be
*NL*
glad
to
see
you
,
brother
,
in
the
afternoon
;
for
I
have
somewhat
of
*NL*
importance
to
mention
to
you
.
--
At
present
,
Mr
Blifil
,
as
well
as
you
,
*NL*
must
excuse
me
;
for
I
am
in
haste
to
dress
.
''
``
Well
,
but
,
''
said
the
*NL*
squire
,
``
do
appoint
a
time
.
''
``
Indeed
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
can
appoint
no
*NL*
time
.
I
tell
you
I
will
see
you
in
the
afternoon
.
''
--
``
What
the
devil
*NL*
would
you
have
me
do
?
''
cries
the
squire
,
turning
to
Blifil
;
``
I
can
no
*NL*
more
turn
her
,
than
a
beagle
can
turn
an
old
hare
.
Perhaps
she
will
*NL*
be
in
a
better
humour
in
the
afternoon
.
''
--
``
I
am
condemned
,
I
see
,
*NL*
sir
,
to
misfortune
,
''
answered
Blifil
;
``
but
I
shall
always
own
my
*NL*
obligations
to
you
.
''
He
then
took
a
ceremonious
leave
of
Mrs
Western
,
*NL*
who
was
altogether
as
ceremonious
on
her
part
;
and
then
they
*NL*
departed
,
the
squire
muttering
to
himself
with
an
oath
,
that
Blifil
*NL*
should
see
his
daughter
in
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Mr
Western
was
little
pleased
with
this
interview
,
Blifil
was
less
.
*NL*
As
to
the
former
,
he
imputed
the
whole
behaviour
of
his
sister
to
her
*NL*
humour
only
,
and
to
her
dissatisfaction
at
the
omission
of
ceremony
in
*NL*
the
visit
;
but
Blifil
saw
a
little
deeper
into
things
.
He
suspected
*NL*
somewhat
of
more
consequence
,
from
two
or
three
words
which
dropt
from
*NL*
the
lady
;
and
,
to
say
the
truth
,
he
suspected
right
,
as
will
appear
*NL*
when
I
have
unfolded
the
several
matters
which
will
be
contained
in
*NL*
the
following
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
viii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Schemes
of
Lady
Bellaston
for
the
ruin
of
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Love
had
taken
too
deep
a
root
in
the
mind
of
Lord
Fellamar
to
be
*NL*
plucked
up
by
the
rude
hands
of
Mr
Western
.
In
the
heat
of
resentment
*NL*
he
had
,
indeed
,
given
a
commission
to
Captain
Egglane
,
which
the
*NL*
captain
had
far
exceeded
in
the
execution
;
nor
had
it
been
executed
at
*NL*
all
,
had
his
lordship
been
able
to
find
the
captain
after
he
had
seen
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
,
which
was
in
the
afternoon
of
the
day
after
he
had
*NL*
received
the
affront
;
but
so
industrious
was
the
captain
in
the
*NL*
discharge
of
his
duty
,
that
,
having
after
long
enquiry
found
out
the
*NL*
squire
's
lodgings
very
late
in
the
evening
,
he
sat
up
all
night
at
a
*NL*
tavern
,
that
he
might
not
miss
the
squire
in
the
morning
,
and
by
that
*NL*
means
missed
the
revocation
which
my
lord
had
sent
to
his
lodgings
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
then
next
after
the
intended
rape
of
Sophia
,
his
*NL*
lordship
,
as
we
have
said
,
made
a
visit
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
laid
*NL*
open
so
much
of
the
character
of
the
squire
,
that
his
lordship
plainly
*NL*
saw
the
absurdity
he
had
been
guilty
of
in
taking
any
offence
at
his
*NL*
words
,
especially
as
he
had
those
honourable
designs
on
his
daughter
.
*NL*
He
then
unbosomed
the
violence
of
his
passion
to
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
*NL*
readily
undertook
the
cause
,
and
encouraged
him
with
certain
assurance
*NL*
of
a
most
favourable
reception
from
all
the
elders
of
the
family
,
and
*NL*
from
the
father
himself
when
he
should
be
sober
,
and
should
be
made
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
offer
made
to
his
daughter
.
The
only
*NL*
danger
,
she
said
,
lay
in
the
fellow
she
had
formerly
mentioned
,
who
,
*NL*
though
a
beggar
and
a
vagabond
,
had
,
by
some
means
or
other
,
she
knew
*NL*
not
what
,
procured
himself
tolerable
cloaths
,
and
past
for
a
*NL*
gentleman
.
``
Now
,
''
says
she
,
``
as
I
have
,
for
the
sake
of
my
cousin
,
*NL*
made
it
my
business
to
enquire
after
this
fellow
,
I
have
luckily
found
*NL*
out
his
lodgings
;
''
with
which
she
then
acquainted
his
lordship
.
``
I
am
*NL*
thinking
,
my
lord
,
''
added
she
''
-LRB-
for
this
fellow
is
too
mean
for
your
*NL*
personal
resentment
-RRB-
,
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
for
your
*NL*
lordship
to
contrive
some
method
of
having
him
pressed
and
sent
on
*NL*
board
a
ship
.
Neither
law
nor
conscience
forbid
this
project
:
for
the
*NL*
fellow
,
I
promise
you
,
however
well
drest
,
is
but
a
vagabond
,
and
as
*NL*
proper
as
any
fellow
in
the
streets
to
be
pressed
into
the
service
;
*NL*
and
as
for
the
conscientious
part
,
surely
the
preservation
of
a
young
*NL*
lady
from
such
ruin
is
a
most
meritorious
act
;
nay
,
with
regard
to
the
*NL*
fellow
himself
,
unless
he
could
succeed
-LRB-
which
Heaven
forbid
-RRB-
with
my
*NL*
cousin
,
it
may
probably
be
the
means
of
preserving
him
from
the
*NL*
gallows
,
and
perhaps
may
make
his
fortune
in
an
honest
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Fellamar
very
heartily
thanked
her
ladyship
for
the
part
which
*NL*
she
was
pleased
to
take
in
the
affair
,
upon
the
success
of
which
his
*NL*
whole
future
happiness
entirely
depended
.
He
said
,
he
saw
at
present
*NL*
no
objection
to
the
pressing
scheme
,
and
would
consider
of
putting
it
*NL*
in
execution
.
He
then
most
earnestly
recommended
to
her
ladyship
to
do
*NL*
him
the
honour
of
immediately
mentioning
his
proposals
to
the
family
;
*NL*
to
whom
he
said
he
offered
a
_
carte
blanche
_
,
and
would
settle
his
*NL*
fortune
in
almost
any
manner
they
should
require
.
And
after
uttering
*NL*
many
ecstasies
and
raptures
concerning
Sophia
,
he
took
his
leave
and
*NL*
departed
,
but
not
before
he
had
received
the
strongest
charge
to
*NL*
beware
of
Jones
,
and
to
lose
no
time
in
securing
his
person
,
where
he
*NL*
should
no
longer
be
in
a
capacity
of
making
any
attempts
to
the
ruin
*NL*
of
the
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
Mrs
Western
was
arrived
at
her
lodgings
,
a
card
was
*NL*
despatched
with
her
compliments
to
Lady
Bellaston
;
who
no
sooner
*NL*
received
it
than
,
with
the
impatience
of
a
lover
,
she
flew
to
her
*NL*
cousin
,
rejoiced
at
this
fair
opportunity
,
which
beyond
her
hopes
*NL*
offered
itself
,
for
she
was
much
better
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
*NL*
making
the
proposals
to
a
woman
of
sense
,
and
who
knew
the
world
,
than
*NL*
to
a
gentleman
whom
she
honoured
with
the
appellation
of
Hottentot
;
*NL*
though
,
indeed
,
from
him
she
apprehended
no
danger
of
a
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
ladies
being
met
,
after
very
short
previous
ceremonials
,
fell
*NL*
to
business
,
which
was
indeed
almost
as
soon
concluded
as
begun
;
for
*NL*
Mrs
Western
no
sooner
heard
the
name
of
Lord
Fellamar
than
her
cheeks
*NL*
glowed
with
pleasure
;
but
when
she
was
acquainted
with
the
eagerness
*NL*
of
his
passion
,
the
earnestness
of
his
proposals
,
and
the
generosity
*NL*
of
his
offer
,
she
declared
her
full
satisfaction
in
the
most
explicit
*NL*
terms
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
progress
of
their
conversation
their
discourse
turned
to
Jones
,
*NL*
and
both
cousins
very
pathetically
lamented
the
unfortunate
attachment
*NL*
which
both
agreed
Sophia
had
to
that
young
fellow
;
and
Mrs
Western
*NL*
entirely
attributed
it
to
the
folly
of
her
brother
's
management
.
She
*NL*
concluded
,
however
,
at
last
,
with
declaring
her
confidence
in
the
good
*NL*
understanding
of
her
niece
,
who
,
though
she
would
not
give
up
her
*NL*
affection
in
favour
of
Blifil
,
will
,
I
doubt
not
,
says
she
,
soon
be
*NL*
prevailed
upon
to
sacrifice
a
simple
inclination
to
the
addresses
of
a
*NL*
fine
gentleman
,
who
brings
her
both
a
title
and
a
large
estate
:
``
For
,
*NL*
indeed
,
''
added
she
,
``
I
must
do
Sophy
the
justice
to
confess
this
*NL*
Blifil
is
but
a
hideous
kind
of
fellow
,
as
you
know
,
Bellaston
,
all
*NL*
country
gentlemen
are
,
and
hath
nothing
but
his
fortune
to
recommend
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
''
said
Lady
Bellaston
,
``
I
do
n't
then
so
much
wonder
at
my
cousin
;
*NL*
for
I
promise
you
this
Jones
is
a
very
agreeable
fellow
,
and
hath
one
*NL*
virtue
,
which
the
men
say
is
a
great
recommendation
to
us
.
What
do
you
*NL*
think
,
Mrs
Western
--
I
shall
certainly
make
you
laugh
;
nay
,
I
can
*NL*
hardly
tell
you
myself
for
laughing
--
will
you
believe
that
the
fellow
*NL*
hath
had
the
assurance
to
make
love
to
me
?
But
if
you
should
be
*NL*
inclined
to
disbelieve
it
,
here
is
evidence
enough
,
his
own
*NL*
handwriting
,
I
assure
you
.
''
She
then
delivered
her
cousin
the
letter
*NL*
with
the
proposals
of
marriage
,
which
,
if
the
reader
hath
a
desire
to
*NL*
see
,
he
will
find
already
on
record
in
the
XVth
book
of
this
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
I
am
astonished
,
''
said
Mrs
Western
;
``
this
is
,
indeed
,
a
*NL*
masterpiece
of
assurance
.
With
your
leave
I
may
possibly
make
some
use
*NL*
of
this
letter
.
''
``
You
have
my
full
liberty
,
''
cries
Lady
Bellaston
,
``
to
*NL*
apply
it
to
what
purpose
you
please
.
However
,
I
would
not
have
it
*NL*
shewn
to
any
but
Miss
Western
,
nor
to
her
unless
you
find
occasion
.
''
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
how
did
you
use
the
fellow
?
''
returned
Mrs
Western
.
``
Not
as
*NL*
a
husband
,
''
said
the
lady
;
``
I
am
not
married
,
I
promise
you
,
my
dear
.
*NL*
You
know
,
Bell
,
I
have
tried
the
comforts
once
already
;
and
once
,
I
*NL*
think
,
is
enough
for
any
reasonable
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
Lady
Bellaston
thought
would
certainly
turn
the
balance
*NL*
against
Jones
in
the
mind
of
Sophia
,
and
she
was
emboldened
to
give
it
*NL*
up
,
partly
by
her
hopes
of
having
him
instantly
dispatched
out
of
the
*NL*
way
,
and
partly
by
having
secured
the
evidence
of
Honour
,
who
,
upon
*NL*
sounding
her
,
she
saw
sufficient
reason
to
imagine
was
prepared
to
*NL*
testify
whatever
she
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
perhaps
the
reader
may
wonder
why
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
in
her
heart
*NL*
hated
Sophia
,
should
be
so
desirous
of
promoting
a
match
which
was
so
*NL*
much
to
the
interest
of
the
young
lady
.
Now
,
I
would
desire
such
*NL*
readers
to
look
carefully
into
human
nature
,
page
almost
the
last
,
and
*NL*
there
he
will
find
,
in
scarce
legible
characters
,
that
women
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
preposterous
behaviour
of
mothers
,
aunts
,
&
c.
,
in
*NL*
matrimonial
matters
,
do
in
reality
think
it
so
great
a
misfortune
to
*NL*
have
their
inclinations
in
love
thwarted
,
that
they
imagine
they
ought
*NL*
never
to
carry
enmity
higher
than
upon
these
disappointments
;
again
,
*NL*
he
will
find
it
written
much
about
the
same
place
,
that
a
woman
who
*NL*
hath
once
been
pleased
with
the
possession
of
a
man
,
will
go
above
*NL*
halfway
to
the
devil
,
to
prevent
any
other
woman
from
enjoying
the
*NL*
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
will
not
be
contented
with
these
reasons
,
I
freely
confess
I
see
*NL*
no
other
motive
to
the
actions
of
that
lady
,
unless
we
will
conceive
*NL*
she
was
bribed
by
Lord
Fellamar
,
which
for
my
own
part
I
see
no
cause
*NL*
to
suspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
this
was
the
affair
which
Mrs
Western
was
preparing
to
introduce
*NL*
to
Sophia
,
by
some
prefatory
discourse
on
the
folly
of
love
,
and
on
*NL*
the
wisdom
of
legal
prostitution
for
hire
,
when
her
brother
and
Blifil
*NL*
broke
abruptly
in
upon
her
;
and
hence
arose
all
that
coldness
in
her
*NL*
behaviour
to
Blifil
,
which
,
though
the
squire
,
as
was
usual
with
him
,
*NL*
imputed
to
a
wrong
cause
,
infused
into
Blifil
himself
-LRB-
he
being
a
much
*NL*
more
cunning
man
-RRB-
a
suspicion
of
the
real
truth
.

Chapter
ix
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
Jones
pays
a
visit
to
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
now
,
perhaps
,
be
pleased
to
return
with
us
to
Mr
Jones
,
*NL*
who
,
at
the
appointed
hour
,
attended
on
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
;
but
before
we
*NL*
relate
the
conversation
which
now
past
it
may
be
proper
,
according
to
*NL*
our
method
,
to
return
a
little
back
,
and
to
account
for
so
great
an
*NL*
alteration
of
behaviour
in
this
lady
,
that
from
changing
her
lodging
*NL*
principally
to
avoid
Mr
Jones
,
she
had
now
industriously
,
as
hath
been
*NL*
seen
,
sought
this
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
we
shall
need
only
to
resort
to
what
happened
the
preceding
*NL*
day
,
when
,
hearing
from
Lady
Bellaston
that
Mr
Western
was
arrived
in
*NL*
town
,
she
went
to
pay
her
duty
to
him
,
at
his
lodgings
at
Piccadilly
,
*NL*
where
she
was
received
with
many
scurvy
compellations
too
coarse
to
be
*NL*
repeated
,
and
was
even
threatened
to
be
kicked
out
of
doors
.
From
*NL*
hence
,
an
old
servant
of
her
aunt
Western
,
with
whom
she
was
well
*NL*
acquainted
,
conducted
her
to
the
lodgings
of
that
lady
,
who
treated
*NL*
her
not
more
kindly
,
but
more
politely
;
or
,
to
say
the
truth
,
with
*NL*
rudeness
in
another
way
.
In
short
,
she
returned
from
both
,
plainly
*NL*
convinced
,
not
only
that
her
scheme
of
reconciliation
had
proved
*NL*
abortive
,
but
that
she
must
for
ever
give
over
all
thoughts
of
*NL*
bringing
it
about
by
any
means
whatever
.
From
this
moment
desire
of
*NL*
revenge
only
filled
her
mind
;
and
in
this
temper
meeting
Jones
at
the
*NL*
play
,
an
opportunity
seemed
to
her
to
occur
of
effecting
this
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
must
remember
that
he
was
acquainted
by
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
in
*NL*
the
account
she
gave
of
her
own
story
,
with
the
fondness
Mrs
Western
*NL*
had
formerly
shewn
for
Mr
Fitzpatrick
at
Bath
,
from
the
disappointment
*NL*
of
which
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
derived
the
great
bitterness
her
aunt
had
*NL*
expressed
toward
her
.
She
had
,
therefore
,
no
doubt
but
that
the
good
*NL*
lady
would
as
easily
listen
to
the
addresses
of
Mr
Jones
as
she
had
*NL*
before
done
to
the
other
;
for
the
superiority
of
charms
was
clearly
on
*NL*
the
side
of
Mr
Jones
;
and
the
advance
which
her
aunt
had
since
made
in
*NL*
age
,
she
concluded
-LRB-
how
justly
I
will
not
say
-RRB-
,
was
an
argument
rather
*NL*
in
favour
of
her
project
than
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
,
when
Jones
attended
,
after
a
previous
declaration
of
her
*NL*
desire
of
serving
him
,
arising
,
as
she
said
,
from
a
firm
assurance
how
*NL*
much
she
should
by
so
doing
oblige
Sophia
;
and
after
some
excuses
for
*NL*
her
former
disappointment
,
and
after
acquainting
Mr
Jones
in
whose
*NL*
custody
his
mistress
was
,
of
which
she
thought
him
ignorant
;
she
very
*NL*
explicitly
mentioned
her
scheme
to
him
,
and
advised
him
to
make
sham
*NL*
addresses
to
the
older
lady
,
in
order
to
procure
an
easy
access
to
the
*NL*
younger
,
informing
him
at
the
same
time
of
the
success
which
Mr
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
had
formerly
owed
to
the
very
same
stratagem
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
expressed
great
gratitude
to
the
lady
for
the
kind
intentions
*NL*
towards
him
which
she
had
expressed
,
and
indeed
testified
,
by
this
*NL*
proposal
;
but
,
besides
intimating
some
diffidence
of
success
from
the
*NL*
lady
's
knowledge
of
his
love
to
her
niece
,
which
had
not
been
her
case
*NL*
in
regard
to
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
he
said
,
he
was
afraid
Miss
Western
would
*NL*
never
agree
to
an
imposition
of
this
kind
,
as
well
from
her
utter
*NL*
detestation
of
all
fallacy
as
from
her
avowed
duty
to
her
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
was
a
little
nettled
at
this
;
and
indeed
,
if
it
may
*NL*
not
be
called
a
lapse
of
the
tongue
,
it
was
a
small
deviation
from
*NL*
politeness
in
Jones
,
and
into
which
he
scarce
would
have
fallen
,
had
*NL*
not
the
delight
he
felt
in
praising
Sophia
hurried
him
out
of
all
*NL*
reflection
;
for
this
commendation
of
one
cousin
was
more
than
a
tacit
*NL*
rebuke
on
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
lady
,
with
some
warmth
,
``
I
can
not
think
*NL*
there
is
anything
easier
than
to
cheat
an
old
woman
with
a
profession
*NL*
of
love
,
when
her
complexion
is
amorous
;
and
,
though
she
is
my
aunt
,
I
*NL*
must
say
there
never
was
a
more
liquorish
one
than
her
ladyship
.
Ca
n't
*NL*
you
pretend
that
the
despair
of
possessing
her
niece
,
from
her
being
*NL*
promised
to
Blifil
,
has
made
you
turn
your
thoughts
towards
her
?
As
to
*NL*
my
cousin
Sophia
,
I
ca
n't
imagine
her
to
be
such
a
simpleton
as
to
*NL*
have
the
least
scruple
on
such
an
account
,
or
to
conceive
any
harm
in
*NL*
punishing
one
of
these
haggs
for
the
many
mischiefs
they
bring
upon
*NL*
families
by
their
tragi-comic
passions
;
for
which
I
think
it
is
a
pity
*NL*
they
are
not
punishable
by
law
.
I
had
no
such
scruple
myself
;
and
yet
*NL*
I
hope
my
cousin
Sophia
will
not
think
it
an
affront
when
I
say
she
*NL*
can
not
detest
every
real
species
of
falsehood
more
than
her
cousin
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
.
To
my
aunt
,
indeed
,
I
pretend
no
duty
,
nor
doth
she
*NL*
deserve
any
.
However
,
sir
,
I
have
given
you
my
advice
;
and
if
you
*NL*
decline
pursuing
it
,
I
shall
have
the
less
opinion
of
your
*NL*
understanding
--
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
now
clearly
saw
the
error
he
had
committed
,
and
exerted
his
*NL*
utmost
power
to
rectify
it
;
but
he
only
faultered
and
stuttered
into
*NL*
nonsense
and
contradiction
.
To
say
the
truth
,
it
is
often
safer
to
*NL*
abide
by
the
consequences
of
the
first
blunder
than
to
endeavour
to
*NL*
rectify
it
;
for
by
such
endeavours
we
generally
plunge
deeper
instead
*NL*
of
extricating
ourselves
;
and
few
persons
will
on
such
occasions
have
*NL*
the
good-nature
which
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
displayed
to
Jones
,
by
saying
,
*NL*
with
a
smile
,
``
You
need
attempt
no
more
excuses
;
for
I
can
easily
*NL*
forgive
a
real
lover
,
whatever
is
the
effect
of
fondness
for
his
*NL*
mistress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
renewed
her
proposal
,
and
very
fervently
recommended
it
,
*NL*
omitting
no
argument
which
her
invention
could
suggest
on
the
subject
;
*NL*
for
she
was
so
violently
incensed
against
her
aunt
,
that
scarce
*NL*
anything
was
capable
of
affording
her
equal
pleasure
with
exposing
*NL*
her
;
and
,
like
a
true
woman
,
she
would
see
no
difficulties
in
the
*NL*
execution
of
a
favourite
scheme
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
however
,
persisted
in
declining
the
undertaking
,
which
had
not
,
*NL*
indeed
,
the
least
probability
of
success
.
He
easily
perceived
the
*NL*
motives
which
induced
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
to
be
so
eager
in
pressing
her
*NL*
advice
.
He
said
he
would
not
deny
the
tender
and
passionate
regard
he
*NL*
had
for
Sophia
;
but
was
so
conscious
of
the
inequality
of
their
*NL*
situations
,
that
he
could
never
flatter
himself
so
far
as
to
hope
that
*NL*
so
divine
a
young
lady
would
condescend
to
think
on
so
unworthy
a
man
;
*NL*
nay
,
he
protested
,
he
could
scarce
bring
himself
to
wish
she
should
.
*NL*
He
concluded
with
a
profession
of
generous
sentiments
,
which
we
have
*NL*
not
at
present
leisure
to
insert
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
some
fine
women
-LRB-
for
I
dare
not
here
speak
in
too
general
*NL*
terms
-RRB-
with
whom
self
is
so
predominant
,
that
they
never
detach
it
*NL*
from
any
subject
;
and
,
as
vanity
is
with
them
a
ruling
principle
,
they
*NL*
are
apt
to
lay
hold
of
whatever
praise
they
meet
with
;
and
,
though
the
*NL*
property
of
others
,
convey
it
to
their
own
use
.
In
the
company
of
*NL*
these
ladies
it
is
impossible
to
say
anything
handsome
of
another
*NL*
woman
which
they
will
not
apply
to
themselves
;
nay
,
they
often
improve
*NL*
the
praise
they
seize
;
as
,
for
instance
,
if
her
beauty
,
her
wit
,
her
*NL*
gentility
,
her
good
humour
deserve
so
much
commendation
,
what
do
I
*NL*
deserve
,
who
possess
those
qualities
in
so
much
more
eminent
a
degree
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
these
ladies
a
man
often
recommends
himself
while
he
is
commending
*NL*
another
woman
;
and
,
while
he
is
expressing
ardour
and
generous
*NL*
sentiments
for
his
mistress
,
they
are
considering
what
a
charming
*NL*
lover
this
man
would
make
to
them
,
who
can
feel
all
this
tenderness
*NL*
for
an
inferior
degree
of
merit
.
Of
this
,
strange
as
it
may
seem
,
I
*NL*
have
seen
many
instances
besides
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
to
whom
all
this
*NL*
really
happened
,
and
who
now
began
to
feel
a
somewhat
for
Mr
Jones
,
*NL*
the
symptoms
of
which
she
much
sooner
understood
than
poor
Sophia
had
*NL*
formerly
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
the
truth
,
perfect
beauty
in
both
sexes
is
a
more
irresistible
*NL*
object
than
it
is
generally
thought
;
for
,
notwithstanding
some
of
us
*NL*
are
contented
with
more
homely
lots
,
and
learn
by
rote
-LRB-
as
children
to
*NL*
repeat
what
gives
them
no
idea
-RRB-
to
despise
outside
,
and
to
value
more
*NL*
solid
charms
;
yet
I
have
always
observed
,
at
the
approach
of
*NL*
consummate
beauty
,
that
these
more
solid
charms
only
shine
with
that
*NL*
kind
of
lustre
which
the
stars
have
after
the
rising
of
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jones
had
finished
his
exclamations
,
many
of
which
would
have
*NL*
become
the
mouth
of
Orooendates
himself
,
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
heaved
a
*NL*
deep
sigh
,
and
,
taking
her
eyes
off
from
Jones
,
on
whom
they
had
been
*NL*
some
time
fixed
,
and
dropping
them
on
the
ground
,
she
cried
,
``
Indeed
,
*NL*
Mr
Jones
,
I
pity
you
;
but
it
is
the
curse
of
such
tenderness
to
be
*NL*
thrown
away
on
those
who
are
insensible
of
it
.
I
know
my
cousin
better
*NL*
than
you
,
Mr
Jones
,
and
I
must
say
,
any
woman
who
makes
no
return
to
*NL*
such
a
passion
,
and
such
a
person
,
is
unworthy
of
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
madam
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
you
ca
n't
mean
--
''
``
Mean
!
''
cries
Mrs
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
,
``
I
know
not
what
I
mean
;
there
is
something
,
I
think
,
in
*NL*
true
tenderness
bewitching
;
few
women
ever
meet
with
it
in
men
,
and
*NL*
fewer
still
know
how
to
value
it
when
they
do
.
I
never
heard
such
*NL*
truly
noble
sentiments
,
and
I
ca
n't
tell
how
it
is
,
but
you
force
one
*NL*
to
believe
you
.
Sure
she
must
be
the
most
contemptible
of
women
who
*NL*
can
overlook
such
merit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
manner
and
look
with
which
all
this
was
spoke
infused
a
suspicion
*NL*
into
Jones
which
we
do
n't
care
to
convey
in
direct
words
to
the
*NL*
reader
.
Instead
of
making
any
answer
,
he
said
,
``
I
am
afraid
,
madam
,
I
*NL*
have
made
too
tiresome
a
visit
;
''
and
offered
to
take
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
sir
,
''
answered
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
.
--
``
Indeed
I
pity
you
,
Mr
*NL*
Jones
;
indeed
I
do
:
but
if
you
are
going
,
consider
of
the
scheme
I
*NL*
have
mentioned
--
I
am
convinced
you
will
approve
it
--
and
let
me
see
you
*NL*
again
as
soon
as
you
can
.
--
To-morrow
morning
if
you
will
,
or
at
least
*NL*
some
time
to-morrow
.
I
shall
be
at
home
all
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
then
,
after
many
expressions
of
thanks
,
very
respectfully
*NL*
retired
;
nor
could
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
forbear
making
him
a
present
of
a
*NL*
look
at
parting
,
by
which
if
he
had
understood
nothing
,
he
must
have
*NL*
had
no
understanding
in
the
language
of
the
eyes
.
In
reality
,
it
*NL*
confirmed
his
resolution
of
returning
to
her
no
more
;
for
,
faulty
as
*NL*
he
hath
hitherto
appeared
in
this
history
,
his
whole
thoughts
were
now
*NL*
so
confined
to
his
Sophia
,
that
I
believe
no
woman
upon
earth
could
*NL*
have
now
drawn
him
into
an
act
of
inconstancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortune
,
however
,
who
was
not
his
friend
,
resolved
,
as
he
intended
to
*NL*
give
her
no
second
opportunity
,
to
make
the
best
of
this
;
and
*NL*
accordingly
produced
the
tragical
incident
which
we
are
now
in
*NL*
sorrowful
notes
to
record
.

*NL*
The
consequence
of
the
preceding
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Fitzpatrick
having
received
the
letter
before
mentioned
from
Mrs
*NL*
Western
,
and
being
by
that
means
acquainted
with
the
place
to
which
*NL*
his
wife
was
retired
,
returned
directly
to
Bath
,
and
thence
the
day
*NL*
after
set
forward
to
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
hath
been
already
often
informed
of
the
jealous
temper
of
*NL*
this
gentleman
.
He
may
likewise
be
pleased
to
remember
the
suspicion
*NL*
which
he
had
conceived
of
Jones
at
Upton
,
upon
his
finding
him
in
the
*NL*
room
with
Mrs
Waters
;
and
,
though
sufficient
reasons
had
afterwards
*NL*
appeared
entirely
to
clear
up
that
suspicion
,
yet
now
the
reading
so
*NL*
handsome
a
character
of
Mr
Jones
from
his
wife
,
caused
him
to
reflect
*NL*
that
she
likewise
was
in
the
inn
at
the
same
time
,
and
jumbled
*NL*
together
such
a
confusion
of
circumstances
in
a
head
which
was
*NL*
naturally
none
of
the
clearest
,
that
the
whole
produced
that
*NL*
green-eyed
monster
mentioned
by
Shakespear
in
his
tragedy
of
Othello
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
as
he
was
enquiring
in
the
street
after
his
wife
,
and
had
*NL*
just
received
directions
to
the
door
,
unfortunately
Mr
Jones
was
*NL*
issuing
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
did
not
yet
recollect
the
face
of
Jones
;
however
,
seeing
a
*NL*
young
well-dressed
fellow
coming
from
his
wife
,
he
made
directly
up
to
*NL*
him
,
and
asked
him
what
he
had
been
doing
in
that
house
?
``
for
I
am
*NL*
sure
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
must
have
been
in
it
,
as
I
saw
you
come
out
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
answered
very
modestly
,
``
That
he
had
been
visiting
a
lady
*NL*
there
.
''
To
which
Fitzpatrick
replied
,
``
What
business
have
you
with
the
*NL*
lady
?
''
Upon
which
Jones
,
who
now
perfectly
remembered
the
voice
,
*NL*
features
,
and
indeed
coat
,
of
the
gentleman
,
cried
out
--
``
Ha
,
my
good
*NL*
friend
!
give
me
your
hand
;
I
hope
there
is
no
ill
blood
remaining
*NL*
between
us
,
upon
a
small
mistake
which
happened
so
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
,
sir
,
''
said
Fitzpatrick
,
``
I
do
n't
know
your
name
nor
*NL*
your
face
.
''
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
neither
have
I
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
knowing
your
name
,
but
your
face
I
very
well
remember
to
have
seen
*NL*
before
at
Upton
,
where
a
foolish
quarrel
happened
between
us
,
which
,
*NL*
if
it
is
not
made
up
yet
,
we
will
now
make
up
over
a
bottle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Upton
!
''
cried
the
other
;
--
``
Ha
!
upon
my
soul
,
I
believe
your
name
*NL*
is
Jones
?
''
``
Indeed
,
''
answered
he
,
``
it
is
.
''
--
``
O
!
upon
my
soul
,
''
cries
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
,
``
you
are
the
very
man
I
wanted
to
meet
.
--
Upon
my
soul
I
*NL*
will
drink
a
bottle
with
you
presently
;
but
first
I
will
give
you
a
*NL*
great
knock
over
the
pate
.
There
is
for
you
,
you
rascal
.
Upon
my
soul
,
*NL*
if
you
do
not
give
me
satisfaction
for
that
blow
,
I
will
give
you
*NL*
another
.
''
And
then
,
drawing
his
sword
,
put
himself
in
a
posture
of
*NL*
defence
,
which
was
the
only
science
he
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
a
little
staggered
by
the
blow
,
which
came
somewhat
*NL*
unexpectedly
;
but
presently
recovering
himself
he
also
drew
,
and
*NL*
though
he
understood
nothing
of
fencing
,
prest
on
so
boldly
upon
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
,
that
he
beat
down
his
guard
,
and
sheathed
one
half
of
his
*NL*
sword
in
the
body
of
the
said
gentleman
,
who
had
no
sooner
received
it
*NL*
than
he
stept
backwards
,
dropped
the
point
of
his
sword
,
and
leaning
*NL*
upon
it
,
cried
,
``
I
have
satisfaction
enough
:
I
am
a
dead
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
not
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
but
whatever
be
the
consequence
,
you
must
*NL*
be
sensible
you
have
drawn
it
upon
yourself
.
''
At
this
instant
a
number
*NL*
of
fellows
rushed
in
and
seized
Jones
,
who
told
them
he
should
make
no
*NL*
resistance
,
and
begged
some
of
them
at
least
would
take
care
of
the
*NL*
wounded
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
''
cries
one
of
the
fellows
,
``
the
wounded
gentleman
will
be
taken
*NL*
care
enough
of
;
for
I
suppose
he
hath
not
many
hours
to
live
.
As
for
*NL*
you
,
sir
,
you
have
a
month
at
least
good
yet
.
''
``
D
--
n
me
,
Jack
,
''
said
*NL*
another
,
``
he
hath
prevented
his
voyage
;
he
's
bound
to
another
port
*NL*
now
;
''
and
many
other
such
jests
was
our
poor
Jones
made
the
subject
of
*NL*
by
these
fellows
,
who
were
indeed
the
gang
employed
by
Lord
Fellamar
,
*NL*
and
had
dogged
him
into
the
house
of
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
,
waiting
for
him
*NL*
at
the
corner
of
the
street
when
this
unfortunate
accident
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
who
commanded
this
gang
very
wisely
concluded
that
his
*NL*
business
was
now
to
deliver
his
prisoner
into
the
hands
of
the
civil
*NL*
magistrate
.
He
ordered
him
,
therefore
,
to
be
carried
to
a
*NL*
public-house
,
where
,
having
sent
for
a
constable
,
he
delivered
him
to
*NL*
his
custody
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
constable
,
seeing
Mr
Jones
very
well
drest
,
and
hearing
that
the
*NL*
accident
had
happened
in
a
duel
,
treated
his
prisoner
with
great
*NL*
civility
,
and
at
his
request
dispatched
a
messenger
to
enquire
after
*NL*
the
wounded
gentleman
,
who
was
now
at
a
tavern
under
the
surgeon
's
*NL*
hands
.
The
report
brought
back
was
,
that
the
wound
was
certainly
*NL*
mortal
,
and
there
were
no
hopes
of
life
.
Upon
which
the
constable
*NL*
informed
Jones
that
he
must
go
before
a
justice
.
He
answered
,
*NL*
``
Wherever
you
please
;
I
am
indifferent
as
to
what
happens
to
me
;
for
*NL*
though
I
am
convinced
I
am
not
guilty
of
murder
in
the
eye
of
the
law
,
*NL*
yet
the
weight
of
blood
I
find
intolerable
upon
my
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
was
now
conducted
before
the
justice
,
where
the
surgeon
who
*NL*
dressed
Mr
Fitzpatrick
appeared
,
and
deposed
that
he
believed
the
*NL*
wound
to
be
mortal
;
upon
which
the
prisoner
was
committed
to
the
*NL*
Gatehouse
.
It
was
very
late
at
night
,
so
that
Jones
would
not
send
for
*NL*
Partridge
till
the
next
morning
;
and
,
as
he
never
shut
his
eyes
till
*NL*
seven
,
so
it
was
near
twelve
before
the
poor
fellow
,
who
was
greatly
*NL*
frightened
at
not
hearing
from
his
master
so
long
,
received
a
message
*NL*
which
almost
deprived
him
of
his
being
when
he
heard
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
Gatehouse
with
trembling
knees
and
a
beating
heart
,
and
*NL*
was
no
sooner
arrived
in
the
presence
of
Jones
than
he
lamented
the
*NL*
misfortune
that
had
befallen
him
with
many
tears
,
looking
all
the
*NL*
while
frequently
about
him
in
great
terror
;
for
as
the
news
now
*NL*
arrived
that
Mr
Fitzpatrick
was
dead
,
the
poor
fellow
apprehended
*NL*
every
minute
that
his
ghost
would
enter
the
room
.
At
last
he
delivered
*NL*
him
a
letter
,
which
he
had
like
to
have
forgot
,
and
which
came
from
*NL*
Sophia
by
the
hands
of
Black
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
presently
dispatched
every
one
out
of
the
room
,
and
,
having
*NL*
eagerly
broke
open
the
letter
,
read
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
owe
the
hearing
from
me
again
to
an
accident
which
I
own
*NL*
surprizes
me
.
My
aunt
hath
just
now
shown
me
a
letter
from
you
to
*NL*
Lady
Bellaston
,
which
contains
a
proposal
of
marriage
.
I
am
*NL*
convinced
it
is
your
own
hand
;
and
what
more
surprizes
me
is
,
that
*NL*
it
is
dated
at
the
very
time
when
you
would
have
me
imagine
you
was
*NL*
under
such
concern
on
my
account
.
--
I
leave
you
to
comment
on
this
*NL*
fact
.
All
I
desire
is
,
that
your
name
may
never
more
be
mentioned
*NL*
to
*NL*
*NL*
``
S.

the
present
situation
of
Mr

and
of

he
was
now
tormented
,
we
can
not
give
the
reader
a
better
idea
*NL*
than
by
saying
,
his
misery
was
such
that
even
Thwackum
would
almost
*NL*
have
pitied
him
.
But
,
bad
as
it
is
,
we
shall
at
present
leave
him
in
*NL*
it
,
as
his
good
genius
-LRB-
if
he
really
had
any
-RRB-
seems
to
have
done
.
And
*NL*
here
we
put
an
end
to
the
sixteenth
book
of
our
history
.
*NL*

BOOK

CONTAINING
THREE
DAYS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
a
portion
of
introductory
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
comic
writer
hath
made
his
principal
characters
as
happy
as
he
*NL*
can
,
or
when
a
tragic
writer
hath
brought
them
to
the
highest
pitch
of
*NL*
human
misery
,
they
both
conclude
their
business
to
be
done
,
and
that
*NL*
their
work
is
come
to
a
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
we
been
of
the
tragic
complexion
,
the
reader
must
now
allow
we
*NL*
were
very
nearly
arrived
at
this
period
,
since
it
would
be
difficult
*NL*
for
the
devil
,
or
any
of
his
representatives
on
earth
,
to
have
*NL*
contrived
much
greater
torments
for
poor
Jones
than
those
in
which
we
*NL*
left
him
in
the
last
chapter
;
and
as
for
Sophia
,
a
good-natured
woman
*NL*
would
hardly
wish
more
uneasiness
to
a
rival
than
what
she
must
at
*NL*
present
be
supposed
to
feel
.
What
then
remains
to
complete
the
tragedy
*NL*
but
a
murder
or
two
and
a
few
moral
sentences
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
bring
our
favourites
out
of
their
present
anguish
and
distress
,
*NL*
and
to
land
them
at
last
on
the
shore
of
happiness
,
seems
a
much
*NL*
harder
task
;
a
task
indeed
so
hard
that
we
do
not
undertake
to
execute
*NL*
it
.
In
regard
to
Sophia
,
it
is
more
than
probable
that
we
shall
*NL*
somewhere
or
other
provide
a
good
husband
for
her
in
the
end
--
either
*NL*
Blifil
,
or
my
lord
,
or
somebody
else
;
but
as
to
poor
Jones
,
such
are
*NL*
the
calamities
in
which
he
is
at
present
involved
,
owing
to
his
*NL*
imprudence
,
by
which
if
a
man
doth
not
become
felon
to
the
world
,
he
*NL*
is
at
least
a
_
felo
de
se
_
;
so
destitute
is
he
now
of
friends
,
and
so
*NL*
persecuted
by
enemies
,
that
we
almost
despair
of
bringing
him
to
any
*NL*
good
;
and
if
our
reader
delights
in
seeing
executions
,
I
think
he
*NL*
ought
not
to
lose
any
time
in
taking
a
first
row
at
Tyburn
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
I
faithfully
promise
,
that
,
notwithstanding
any
affection
which
*NL*
we
may
be
supposed
to
have
for
this
rogue
,
whom
we
have
unfortunately
*NL*
made
our
heroe
,
we
will
lend
him
none
of
that
supernatural
assistance
*NL*
with
which
we
are
entrusted
,
upon
condition
that
we
use
it
only
on
*NL*
very
important
occasions
.
If
he
doth
not
therefore
find
some
natural
*NL*
means
of
fairly
extricating
himself
from
all
his
distresses
,
we
will
*NL*
do
no
violence
to
the
truth
and
dignity
of
history
for
his
sake
;
for
*NL*
we
had
rather
relate
that
he
was
hanged
at
Tyburn
-LRB-
which
may
very
*NL*
probably
be
the
case
-RRB-
than
forfeit
our
integrity
,
or
shock
the
faith
*NL*
of
our
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
the
antients
had
a
great
advantage
over
the
moderns
.
Their
*NL*
mythology
,
which
was
at
that
time
more
firmly
believed
by
the
vulgar
*NL*
than
any
religion
is
at
present
,
gave
them
always
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
delivering
a
favourite
heroe
.
Their
deities
were
always
ready
at
the
*NL*
writer
's
elbow
,
to
execute
any
of
his
purposes
;
and
the
more
*NL*
extraordinary
the
invention
was
,
the
greater
was
the
surprize
and
*NL*
delight
of
the
credulous
reader
.
Those
writers
could
with
greater
ease
*NL*
have
conveyed
a
heroe
from
one
country
to
another
,
nay
from
one
world
*NL*
to
another
,
and
have
brought
him
back
again
,
than
a
poor
circumscribed
*NL*
modern
can
deliver
him
from
a
jail
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Arabians
and
Persians
had
an
equal
advantage
in
writing
their
*NL*
tales
from
the
genii
and
fairies
,
which
they
believe
in
as
an
article
*NL*
of
their
faith
,
upon
the
authority
of
the
Koran
itself
.
But
we
have
*NL*
none
of
these
helps
.
To
natural
means
alone
we
are
confined
;
let
us
*NL*
try
therefore
what
,
by
these
means
,
may
be
done
for
poor
Jones
;
though
*NL*
to
confess
the
truth
,
something
whispers
me
in
the
ear
that
he
doth
*NL*
not
yet
know
the
worst
of
his
fortune
;
and
that
a
more
shocking
piece
*NL*
of
news
than
any
he
hath
yet
heard
remains
for
him
in
the
unopened
*NL*
leaves
of
fate
.

Chapter
ii
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
generous
and
grateful
behaviour
of
Mrs
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
and
Mrs
Miller
were
just
sat
down
to
breakfast
,
when
*NL*
Blifil
,
who
had
gone
out
very
early
that
morning
,
returned
to
make
one
*NL*
of
the
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
been
long
seated
before
he
began
as
follows
:
``
Good
Lord
!
my
*NL*
dear
uncle
,
what
do
you
think
hath
happened
?
I
vow
I
am
afraid
of
*NL*
telling
it
you
,
for
fear
of
shocking
you
with
the
remembrance
of
ever
*NL*
having
shewn
any
kindness
to
such
a
villain
.
''
``
What
is
the
matter
,
*NL*
child
?
''
said
the
uncle
.
``
I
fear
I
have
shewn
kindness
in
my
life
to
*NL*
the
unworthy
more
than
once
.
But
charity
doth
not
adopt
the
vices
of
*NL*
its
objects
.
''
``
O
,
sir
!
''
returned
Blifil
,
``
it
is
not
without
the
secret
*NL*
direction
of
Providence
that
you
mention
the
word
adoption
.
Your
*NL*
adopted
son
,
sir
,
that
Jones
,
that
wretch
whom
you
nourished
in
your
*NL*
bosom
,
hath
proved
one
of
the
greatest
villains
upon
earth
.
''
``
By
all
*NL*
that
's
sacred
't
is
false
,
''
cries
Mrs
Miller
.
``
Mr
Jones
is
no
villain
.
*NL*
He
is
one
of
the
worthiest
creatures
breathing
;
and
if
any
other
*NL*
person
had
called
him
villain
,
I
would
have
thrown
all
this
boiling
*NL*
water
in
his
face
.
''
Mr
Allworthy
looked
very
much
amazed
at
this
*NL*
behaviour
.
But
she
did
not
give
him
leave
to
speak
,
before
,
turning
to
*NL*
him
,
she
cried
,
``
I
hope
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
;
I
would
not
*NL*
offend
you
,
sir
,
for
the
world
;
but
,
indeed
,
I
could
not
bear
to
hear
*NL*
him
called
so
.
''
``
I
must
own
,
madam
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
very
gravely
,
``
I
*NL*
am
a
little
surprized
to
hear
you
so
warmly
defend
a
fellow
you
do
not
*NL*
know
.
''
``
O
!
I
do
know
him
,
Mr
Allworthy
,
''
said
she
,
``
indeed
I
do
;
I
*NL*
should
be
the
most
ungrateful
of
all
wretches
if
I
denied
it
.
O
!
he
*NL*
hath
preserved
me
and
my
little
family
;
we
have
all
reason
to
bless
*NL*
him
while
we
live
.
--
And
I
pray
Heaven
to
bless
him
,
and
turn
the
*NL*
hearts
of
his
malicious
enemies
.
I
know
,
I
find
,
I
see
,
he
hath
such
.
''
*NL*
``
You
surprize
me
,
madam
,
still
more
,
''
said
Allworthy
;
``
sure
you
must
*NL*
mean
some
other
.
It
is
impossible
you
should
have
any
such
obligations
*NL*
to
the
man
my
nephew
mentions
.
''
``
Too
surely
,
''
answered
she
,
``
I
have
*NL*
obligations
to
him
of
the
greatest
and
tenderest
kind
.
He
hath
been
*NL*
the
preserver
of
me
and
mine
.
Believe
me
,
sir
,
he
hath
been
abused
,
*NL*
grossly
abused
to
you
;
I
know
he
hath
,
or
you
,
whom
I
know
to
be
all
*NL*
goodness
and
honour
,
would
not
,
after
the
many
kind
and
tender
things
*NL*
I
have
heard
you
say
of
this
poor
helpless
child
,
have
so
disdainfully
*NL*
called
him
fellow
.
--
Indeed
,
my
best
of
friends
,
he
deserves
a
kinder
*NL*
appellation
from
you
,
had
you
heard
the
good
,
the
kind
,
the
grateful
*NL*
things
which
I
have
heard
him
utter
of
you
.
He
never
mentions
your
*NL*
name
but
with
a
sort
of
adoration
.
In
this
very
room
I
have
seen
him
*NL*
on
his
knees
,
imploring
all
the
blessings
of
heaven
upon
your
head
.
I
*NL*
do
not
love
that
child
there
better
than
he
loves
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
sir
,
now
,
''
said
Blifil
,
with
one
of
those
grinning
sneers
with
*NL*
which
the
devil
marks
his
best
beloved
,
``
Mrs
Miller
really
doth
know
*NL*
him
.
I
suppose
you
will
find
she
is
not
the
only
one
of
your
*NL*
acquaintance
to
whom
he
hath
exposed
you
.
As
for
my
character
,
I
*NL*
perceive
,
by
some
hints
she
hath
thrown
out
,
he
hath
been
very
free
*NL*
with
it
,
but
I
forgive
him
.
''
``
And
the
Lord
forgive
you
,
sir
!
''
said
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
;
``
we
have
all
sins
enough
to
stand
in
need
of
his
forgiveness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
Mrs
Miller
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
I
do
not
take
this
*NL*
behaviour
of
yours
to
my
nephew
kindly
;
and
I
do
assure
you
,
as
any
*NL*
reflections
which
you
cast
upon
him
must
come
only
from
that
wickedest
*NL*
of
men
,
they
would
only
serve
,
if
that
were
possible
,
to
heighten
my
*NL*
resentment
against
him
:
for
I
must
tell
you
,
Mrs
Miller
,
the
young
man
*NL*
who
now
stands
before
you
hath
ever
been
the
warmest
advocate
for
the
*NL*
ungrateful
wretch
whose
cause
you
espouse
.
This
,
I
think
,
when
you
*NL*
hear
it
from
my
own
mouth
,
will
make
you
wonder
at
so
much
baseness
*NL*
and
ingratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
deceived
,
sir
,
''
answered
Mrs
Miller
;
``
if
they
were
the
last
*NL*
words
which
were
to
issue
from
my
lips
,
I
would
say
you
were
deceived
;
*NL*
and
I
once
more
repeat
it
,
the
Lord
forgive
those
who
have
deceived
*NL*
you
!
I
do
not
pretend
to
say
the
young
man
is
without
faults
;
but
they
*NL*
are
all
the
faults
of
wildness
and
of
youth
;
faults
which
he
may
,
nay
,
*NL*
which
I
am
certain
he
will
,
relinquish
,
and
,
if
he
should
not
,
they
*NL*
are
vastly
overbalanced
by
one
of
the
most
humane
,
tender
,
honest
*NL*
hearts
that
ever
man
was
blest
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
Mrs
Miller
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
had
this
been
related
of
you
,
I
*NL*
should
not
have
believed
it
.
''
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
answered
she
,
``
you
will
*NL*
believe
everything
I
have
said
,
I
am
sure
you
will
:
and
when
you
have
*NL*
heard
the
story
which
I
shall
tell
you
-LRB-
for
I
will
tell
you
all
-RRB-
,
you
*NL*
will
be
so
far
from
being
offended
,
that
you
will
own
-LRB-
I
know
your
*NL*
justice
so
well
-RRB-
,
that
I
must
have
been
the
most
despicable
and
most
*NL*
ungrateful
of
wretches
if
I
had
acted
any
other
part
than
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
madam

''
said
Allworthy
,
``
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
hear
any
good
*NL*
excuse
for
a
behaviour
which
,
I
must
confess

I
think
wants
an
excuse
.
*NL*
And
now
,
madam
,
will
you
be
pleased
to
let
my
nephew
proceed
in
his
*NL*
story
without
interruption
.
He
would
not
have
introduced
a
matter
of
*NL*
slight
consequence
with
such
a
preface
.
Perhaps
even
this
story
will
*NL*
cure
you
of
your
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
gave
tokens
of
submission
,
and
then
Mr
Blifil
began
thus
:
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
sir
,
if
you
do
n't
think
proper
to
resent
the
ill-usage
of
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
,
I
shall
easily
forgive
what
affects
me
only
.
I
think
your
*NL*
goodness
hath
not
deserved
this
indignity
at
her
hands
.
''
``
Well
,
*NL*
child
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
but
what
is
this
new
instance
?
What
hath
he
*NL*
done
of
late
?

``
What

''
cries
Blifil
,
``
notwithstanding
all
Mrs
Miller
*NL*
hath
said
,
I
am
very
sorry
to
relate

what
you

*NL*
heard
from
me
,
had
it
not
been
a
matter
impossible
to
conceal
from
the
*NL*
whole
world

In
short
he
hath
killed
a
man
;
I
will
not
say
*NL*
murdered
--
for
perhaps
it
may
not
be
so
construed
in
law
,
and
I
hope
*NL*
the
best
for
his
sake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
looked
shocked
,
and
blessed
himself
;
and
then
,
turning
to
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
,
he
cried
,
``
Well
,
madam
,
what
say
you
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
say
,
sir

''
answered
she
,
``
that
I
never
was
more
concerned
at
*NL*
anything
in
my
life

,
if
the
fact
be
true
,
I
am
convinced
the
man
,
*NL*
whoever
he
is
,
was
in
fault

Heaven
knows
there
are
many
villains
in
*NL*
this
town
who
make
it
their
business
to
provoke
young
gentlemen

*NL*
Nothing
but
the
greatest
provocation
could
have
tempted
him
;
for
of
*NL*
all
the
gentlemen
I
ever
had
in
my
house

I
never
saw
one
so
gentle
or
*NL*
so
sweet-tempered

He
was
beloved
by
every
one
in

house

and
every
*NL*
one
who
came
near
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
thus
running
on
,
a
violent
knocking
at
the
door
*NL*
interrupted
their
conversation
,
and
prevented
her
from
proceeding
*NL*
further
,
or
from
receiving
any
answer

for
,
as
she
concluded
this
was
*NL*
a
visitor
to
Mr
Allworthy
,
she
hastily
retired
,
taking
with
her
her
*NL*
little
girl
,
whose
eyes
were
all
over
blubbered
at
the
melancholy
news
*NL*
she
heard
of
Jones
,
who
used
to
call
her
his
little
wife
,
and
not
only
*NL*
gave
her
many
playthings
,
but
spent
whole
hours
in
playing
with
her
*NL*
himself
.

Some
readers
may
,
perhaps
,
be
pleased
with
these
minute
circumstances

in
relating
of
which
we
follow
the
example
of
Plutarch
,
one
of
the
*NL*
best
of
our
brother
historians
;

others

to
whom
they
may
appear
*NL*
trivial

will

we
hope

at

pardon
them

Chapter
iii
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrival
of
Mr
Western
,
with
some
matters
concerning
the
paternal
*NL*
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
had
not
long
left
the
room
when
Mr
Western
entered
;
but
not
*NL*
before
a
small
wrangling
bout
had
passed
between
him
and
his
chairmen
;
*NL*
for
the
fellows
,
who
had
taken
up
their
burden
at
the
Hercules
*NL*
Pillars
,
had
conceived
no
hopes
of
having
any
future
good
customer
in
*NL*
the
squire
;
and
they
were
moreover
farther
encouraged
by
his
*NL*
generosity
-LRB-
for
he
had
given
them
of
his
own
accord
sixpence
more
than
*NL*
their
fare
-RRB-
;
they
therefore
very
boldly
demanded
another
shilling
,
*NL*
which
so
provoked
the
squire
,
that
he
not
only
bestowed
many
hearty
*NL*
curses
on
them
at
the
door
,
but
retained
his
anger
after
he
came
into
*NL*
the
room
;
swearing
that
all
the
Londoners
were
like
the
court
,
and
*NL*
thought
of
nothing
but
plundering
country
gentlemen
.
``
D
--
n
me
,
''
says
*NL*
he
,
``
if
I
wo
n't
walk
in
the
rain
rather
than
get
into
one
of
their
*NL*
hand-barrows
again
.
They
have
jolted
me
more
in
a
mile
than
Brown
Bess
*NL*
would
in
a
long
fox-chase
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
wrath
on
this
occasion
was
a
little
appeased
,
he
resumed
the
*NL*
same
passionate
tone
on
another
.
``
There
,
''
says
he
,
``
there
is
fine
*NL*
business
forwards
now
.
The
hounds
have
changed
at
last
;
and
when
we
*NL*
imagined
we
had
a
fox
to
deal
with
,
od-rat
it
,
it
turns
out
to
be
a
*NL*
badger
at
last
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pray
,
my
good
neighbour
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
drop
your
metaphors
,
and
*NL*
speak
a
little
plainer
.
''
``
Why
,
then
,
''
says
the
squire
,
``
to
tell
you
*NL*
plainly
,
we
have
been
all
this
time
afraid
of
a
son
of
a
whore
of
a
*NL*
bastard
of
somebody

,
I
do
n't
know
whose

not
I.
And
now
here
's
a
*NL*
confounded
son
of
a
whore
of
a
lord
,
who
may
be
a
bastard
too
for
what
*NL*
I
know
or
care
,
for
he
shall
never
have
a
daughter
of
mine
by
my
*NL*
consent
.
They
have
beggared
the
nation
,
but
they
shall
never
beggar
*NL*
me
.
My
land
shall
never
be
sent
over
to
Hanover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
surprize
me
much
,
my
good
friend
,
''
said
Allworthy
.
``
Why
,
zounds
!
*NL*
I
am
surprized
myself
,
''
answered
the
squire
.
``
I
went
to
zee
sister
*NL*
Western
last
night
,
according
to
her
own
appointment
,
and
there
I
was
*NL*
had
into
a
whole
room
full
of
women
.
There
was
my
lady
cousin
*NL*
Bellaston
,
and
my
Lady
Betty

my
Lady
Catherine

I
'd
rather
be
run

one

that
the

says
was
turned
into
a

his

killed

Od-rabbit
it

no

was
ever

such
a

I
dodged
one
way

one
had
me

if
I
offered

back

another
snapped
me

`
O
!
certainly
one
of
the
greatest
matches
in
*NL*
England
,
'
says
one
cousin
-LRB-
here
he
attempted
to
mimic
them
-RRB-
;
`
A
very

advantageous

another

-LRB-

says
that

my

refusing
such
an
offer

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
begin
to
understand
,
''
says
Allworthy
;
``
some
person
hath
made
*NL*
proposals
to
Miss
Western
,
which
the
ladies
of
the
family
approve
,
but
*NL*
is
not
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

''
said
Western
,
``
how
the
devil
should

I
tell
you
it

and
those

you

always
resolved

*NL*
``
As
to
that
point

said
Allworthy

``
I
entirely
release
you

*NL*

Western

*NL*
``
Mr
Western

said
Allworthy

shall
I

hear
my
full
*NL*
sentiments
on
this
matter

''
--
``
Hear
thee
;
ay
,
to
be
sure
I
will
,
''
*NL*
answered
he
.
``
Why
,
then
,
sir
,
''
cries
Allworthy
,
``
I
can
truly
say
,
*NL*
without
a
compliment
either
to
you
or
the
young
lady
,
that
when
this
*NL*
match
was
proposed
,
I
embraced
it
very
readily
and
heartily
,
from
my
*NL*
regard
to
you
both
.
An
alliance
between
two
families
so
nearly
*NL*
neighbours
,
and
between
whom
there
had
always
existed
so
mutual
an
*NL*
intercourse
and
good
harmony
,
I
thought
a
most
desirable
event
;
and
*NL*
with
regard
to
the
young
lady
,
not
only
the
concurrent
opinion
of
all
*NL*
who
knew
her
,
but
my
own
observation
assured
me
that
she
would
be
an
*NL*
inestimable
treasure
to
a
good
husband
.
I
shall
say
nothing
of
her
*NL*
personal
qualifications
,
which
certainly
are
admirable
;
her
good
*NL*
nature
,
her
charitable
disposition
,
her
modesty
,
are
too
well
known
to
*NL*
need
any
panegyric
:
but
she
hath
one
quality
which
existed
in
a
high
*NL*
degree
in
that
best
of
women
,
who
is
now
one
of
the
first
of
angels
,
*NL*
which
,
as
it
is
not
of
a
glaring
kind
,
more
commonly
escapes
*NL*
observation
;
so
little
indeed
is
it
remarked
,
that
I
want
a
word
to
*NL*
express
it
.
I
must
use
negatives
on
this
occasion
.
I
never
heard
*NL*
anything
of
pertness
,
or
what
is
called
repartee
,
out
of
her
mouth
;
no
*NL*
pretence
to
wit
,
much
less
to
that
kind
of
wisdom
which
is
the
result
*NL*
only
of
great
learning
and
experience
,
the
affectation
of
which
,
in
a
*NL*
young
woman
,
is
as
absurd
as
any
of
the
affectations
of
an
ape
.
No
*NL*
dictatorial
sentiments
,
no
judicial
opinions
,
no
profound
criticisms
.
*NL*
Whenever
I
have
seen
her
in
the
company
of
men
,
she
hath
been
all
*NL*
attention
,
with
the
modesty
of
a
learner
,
not
the
forwardness
of
a
*NL*
teacher
.
You
'll
pardon
me
for
it
,
but
I
once
,
to
try
her
only
,
desired
*NL*
her
opinion
on
a
point
which
was
controverted
between
Mr
Thwackum
and
*NL*
Mr
Square
.
To
which
she
answered
,
with
much
sweetness
,
`
You
will
*NL*
pardon
me
,
good
Mr
Allworthy
;
I
am
sure
you
can
not
in
earnest
think
me
*NL*
capable
of
deciding
any
point
in
which
two
such
gentlemen
disagree
.
'
*NL*
Thwackum
and
Square
,
who
both
alike
thought
themselves
sure
of
a
*NL*
favourable
decision
,
seconded
my
request
.
She
answered
with
the
same
*NL*
good
humour
,
`
I
must
absolutely
be
excused
:
for
I
will
affront
neither
*NL*
so
much
as
to
give
my
judgment
on
his
side
.
'
Indeed
,
she
always
shewed
*NL*
the
highest
deference
to
the
understandings
of
men
;
a
quality
*NL*
absolutely
essential
to
the
making
a
good
wife
.
I
shall
only
add
,
that
*NL*
as
she
is
most
apparently
void
of
all
affectation
,
this
deference
must
*NL*
be
certainly
real
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Blifil
sighed
bitterly
;
upon
which
Western
,
whose
eyes
were
full
*NL*
of
tears
at
the
praise
of
Sophia
,
blubbered
out
,
``
Do
n't
be
*NL*
chicken-hearted
,
for
shat
ha
her
,
d
--
n
me
,
shat
ha
her
,
if
she
was
*NL*
twenty
times
as
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
your
promise
,
sir
,
''
cried
Allworthy
,
``
I
was
not
to
be
*NL*
interrupted
.
''
``
Well
,
shat
unt
,
''
answered
the
squire
;
``
I
wo
n't
speak
*NL*
another
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
good
friend
,
''
continued
Allworthy
,
``
I
have
dwelt
so
long
on
*NL*
the
merit
of
this
young
lady
,
partly
as
I
really
am
in
love
with
her
*NL*
character
,
and
partly
that
fortune
-LRB-
for
the
match
in
that
light
is
*NL*
really
advantageous
on
my
nephew
's
side
-RRB-
might
not
be
imagined
to
be
*NL*
my
principal
view
in
having
so
eagerly
embraced
the
proposal
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
I
heartily
wished
to
receive
so
great
a
jewel
into
my
family
;
but
*NL*
though
I
may
wish
for
many
good
things
,
I
would
not
,
therefore
,
steal
*NL*
them
,
or
be
guilty
of
any
violence
or
injustice
to
possess
myself
of
*NL*
them
.
Now
to
force
a
woman
into
a
marriage
contrary
to
her
consent
or
*NL*
approbation
,
is
an
act
of
such
injustice
and
oppression
,
that
I
wish
*NL*
the
laws
of
our
country
could
restrain
it
;
but
a
good
conscience
is
*NL*
never
lawless
in
the
worst
regulated
state
,
and
will
provide
those
*NL*
laws
for
itself
,
which
the
neglect
of
legislators
hath
forgotten
to
*NL*
supply
.
This
is
surely
a
case
of
that
kind
;
for
,
is
it
not
cruel
,
nay
,
*NL*
impious
,
to
force
a
woman
into
that
state
against
her
will
;
for
her
*NL*
behaviour
in
which
she
is
to
be
accountable
to
the
highest
and
most
*NL*
dreadful
court
of
judicature
,
and
to
answer
at
the
peril
of
her
soul
?
*NL*
To
discharge
the
matrimonial
duties
in
an
adequate
manner
is
no
easy
*NL*
task
;
and
shall
we
lay
this
burthen
upon
a
woman
,
while
we
at
the
same
*NL*
time
deprive
her
of
all
that
assistance
which
may
enable
her
to
*NL*
undergo
it
?
Shall
we
tear
her
very
heart
from
her
,
while
we
enjoin
her
*NL*
duties
to
which
a
whole
heart
is
scarce
equal
?
I
must
speak
very
*NL*
plainly
here
.
I
think
parents
who
act
in
this
manner
are
accessories
*NL*
to
all
the
guilt
which
their
children
afterwards
incur
,
and
of
course
*NL*
must
,
before
a
just
judge
,
expect
to
partake
of
their
punishment
;
but
*NL*
if
they
could
avoid
this
,
good
heaven
!
is
there
a
soul
who
can
bear
*NL*
the
thought
of
having
contributed
to
the
damnation
of
his
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
these
reasons
,
my
best
neighbour
,
as
I
see
the
inclinations
of
*NL*
this
young
lady
are
most
unhappily
averse
to
my
nephew
,
I
must
decline
*NL*
any
further
thoughts
of
the
honour
you
intended
him
,
though
I
assure
*NL*
you
I
shall
always
retain
the
most
grateful
sense
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
Western
-LRB-
the
froth
bursting
forth
from
his
lips
the
*NL*
moment
they
were
uncorked
-RRB-
,
``
you
can
not
say
but
I
have
heard
you

if
I
do

answer
every
word

why
then
I
'll
consent
to
gee
the
matter
up

First
then

I
*NL*
desire
you
to
answer

one
question

Did
not

beget

did
not
I

answer
me
that

They
say
,
indeed
,
it
is
a
wise
father
that

knows
his

child
;
but
I
am
sure
I
have
the
best
title
to
her
,
for
*NL*
I
bred
her
up
.
But
I
believe
you
will
allow
me
to
be
her
father
,
and
*NL*
if
I
be
,
am
I
not
to
govern
my
own
child

I
ask
you
that
,
am
I
not
to
*NL*
govern
my
own
child
?
and
if
I
am
to
govern
her
in
other
matters
,
*NL*
surely
I
am
to
govern
her
in
this
,
which
concerns
her
most
.
And
what
*NL*
am
I
desiring
all
this
while
?
Am
I
desiring
her
to
do
anything
for
*NL*
me
?
to
give
me
anything
?

I
am
only
*NL*
desiring
her
to
take
away
half
my
estate
now
,
and
t
`
other
half
when
I
*NL*
die
.
Well
,
and
what
is
it
all
vor
?
Why
,
is
unt
it
to
make
her
happy
?
*NL*
It
's
enough
to
make
one
mad
to
hear
volks
talk
;
if
I
was
going
to
*NL*
marry
myself
,
then
she
would
ha
reason
to
cry
and
to
blubber
;
but
,
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
ha
n't
I
offered
to
bind
down
my
land
in
such
a
manner
,
*NL*
that
I
could
not
marry
if
I
would
,
seeing
as
narro
'
woman
upon
earth
*NL*
would
ha
me
.
What
the
devil
in
hell
can
I
do
more
?
I
contribute
to
*NL*
her
damnation
!
--
Zounds
!
I
'd
zee
all
the
world
d
--
n
'd
bevore
her
*NL*
little
vinger
should
be
hurt
.
Indeed
,
Mr
Allworthy
,
you
must
excuse
*NL*
me
,
but
I
am
surprized
to
hear
you
talk
in
zuch
a
manner
,
and
I
must
*NL*
say
,
take
it
how
you
will
,
that
I
thought
you
had
more
sense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
resented
this
reflection
only
with
a
smile
;
nor
could
he
,
if
*NL*
he
would
have
endeavoured
it
,
have
conveyed
into
that
smile
any
*NL*
mixture
of
malice
or
contempt
.
His
smiles
at
folly
were
indeed
such
as
*NL*
we
may
suppose
the
angels
bestow
on
the
absurdities
of
mankind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
now
desired
to
be
permitted
to
speak
a
few
words
.
``
As
to
using
*NL*
any
violence
on
the
young
lady
,
I
am
sure
I
shall
never
consent
to
it
.
*NL*
My
conscience
will
not
permit
me
to
use
violence
on
any
one
,
much
less
*NL*
on
a
lady
for
whom
,
however
cruel
she
is
to
me
,
I
shall
always
*NL*
preserve
the
purest
and
sincerest
affection
;
but
yet
I
have
read
that
*NL*
women
are
seldom
proof
against
perseverance
.
Why
may
I
not
hope
then
*NL*
by
such
perseverance
at
last
to
gain
those
inclinations
,
in
which
for
*NL*
the
future
I
shall
,
perhaps
,
have
no
rival
;
for
as
for
this
lord
,
Mr
*NL*
Western
is
so
kind
to
prefer
me
to
him
;
and
sure
,
sir
,
you
will
not
*NL*
deny
but
that
a
parent
hath
at
least
a
negative
voice
in
these
*NL*
matters
;
nay
,
I
have
heard
this
very
young
lady
herself
say
so
more
*NL*
than
once
,
and
declare
that
she
thought
children
inexcusable
who
*NL*
married
in
direct
opposition
to
the
will
of
their
parents
.
Besides
,
*NL*
though
the
other
ladies
of
the
family
seem
to
favour
the
pretensions
*NL*
of
my
lord
,
I
do
not
find
the
lady
herself
is
inclined
to
give
him
any
*NL*
countenance
;
alas
!
I
am
too
well
assured
she
is
not
;
I
am
too
sensible
*NL*
that
wickedest
of
men
remains
uppermost
in
her
heart

does

Western

Blifil
,
``

he
fell

singing

capering
about

*NL*

says
Allworthy
,
``

*NL*
``

Do

come

with

at

:
I
have
bespoke
a

of

roasted

a

spare-rib
of
pork
,
and
a
fowl
and
egg-sauce
.
There
will
be
nobody
but
*NL*
ourselves
,
unless
we
have
a
mind
to
have
the
landlord
;
for
I
have
sent
*NL*
Parson
Supple
down
to
Basingstoke
after
my
tobacco-box
,
which
I
left
*NL*
at
an
inn
there
,

I
would
not
lose
it
for
the
world

for
it
is
an
*NL*
old
acquaintance
of
above
twenty
years

standing
.
I
can
tell
you
*NL*
landlord
is
a
vast
comical
bitch
,
you
will
like
un
hugely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
at
last
agreed
to
this
invitation
,
and
soon
after
the
*NL*
squire
went
off
,
singing
and
capering
at
the
hopes
of
seeing
the
*NL*
speedy
tragical
end
of
poor
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
gone
,
Mr
Allworthy
resumed
the
aforesaid
subject
with
much
*NL*
gravity
.
He
told
his
nephew
,
``
He
wished
with
all
his
heart
he
would
*NL*
endeavour
to
conquer
a
passion
,
in
which
I
can
not
,
''
says
he
,
``
flatter
*NL*
you
with
any
hopes
of
succeeding
.
It
is
certainly
a
vulgar
error
,
that
*NL*
aversion
in
a
woman
may
be
conquered
by
perseverance
.
Indifference
*NL*
may
,
perhaps
,
sometimes
yield
to
it
;
but
the
usual
triumphs
gained
by
*NL*
perseverance
in
a
lover
are
over
caprice
,
prudence
,
affectation
,
and
*NL*
often
an
exorbitant
degree
of
levity
,
which
excites
women
not
*NL*
over-warm
in
their
constitutions
to
indulge
their
vanity
by
prolonging
*NL*
the
time
of
courtship
,
even
when
they
are
well
enough
pleased
with
the
*NL*
object
,
and
resolve
-LRB-
if
they
ever
resolve
at
all
-RRB-
to
make
him
a
very
*NL*
pitiful
amends
in
the
end
.
But
a
fixed
dislike
,
as
I
am
afraid
this
*NL*
is
,
will
rather
gather
strength
than
be
conquered
by
time
.
Besides
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
I
have
another
apprehension
which
you
must
excuse
.
I
am
afraid
*NL*
this
passion
which
you
have
for
this
fine
young
creature
hath
her
*NL*
beautiful
person
too
much
for
its
object
,
and
is
unworthy
of
the
name
*NL*
of
that
love
which
is
the
only
foundation
of
matrimonial
felicity
.
To
*NL*
admire
,
to
like
,
and
to
long
for
the
possession
of
a
beautiful
woman
,
*NL*
without
any
regard
to
her
sentiments
towards
us
,
is
,
I
am
afraid
,
too
*NL*
natural
;
but
love
,
I
believe
,
is
the
child
of
love
only
;
at
least
,
I
*NL*
am
pretty
confident
that
to
love
the
creature
who
we
are
assured
hates
*NL*
us
is
not
in
human
nature
.
Examine
your
heart
,
therefore
,
thoroughly
,
*NL*
my
good
boy
,
and
if
,
upon
examination
,
you
have
but
the
least
*NL*
suspicion
of
this
kind
,
I
am
sure
your
own
virtue
and
religion
will
*NL*
impel
you
to
drive
so
vicious
a
passion
from
your
heart
,
and
your
good
*NL*
sense
will
soon
enable
you
to
do
it
without
pain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
pretty
well
guess
Blifil
's
answer
;
but
,
if
he
should
be
*NL*
at
a
loss
,
we
are
not
at
present
at
leisure
to
satisfy
him
,
as
our
*NL*
history
now
hastens
on
to
matters
of
higher
importance
,
and
we
can
no
*NL*
longer
bear
to
be
absent
from
Sophia

*NL*
Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
extraordinary
scene
between
Sophia
and
her
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
lowing
heifer
and
the
bleating
ewe
,
in
herds
and
flocks
,
may
*NL*
ramble
safe
and
unregarded
through
the
pastures
.
These
are
,
indeed
,
*NL*
hereafter
doomed
to
be
the
prey
of
man
;
yet
many
years
are
they
*NL*
suffered
to
enjoy
their
liberty
undisturbed
.
But
if
a
plump
doe
be
*NL*
discovered
to
have
escaped
from
the
forest
,
and
to
repose
herself
in
*NL*
some
field
or
grove
,
the
whole
parish
is
presently
alarmed
,
every
man
*NL*
is
ready
to
set
his
dogs
after
her
;
and
,
if
she
is
preserved
from
the
*NL*
rest
by
the
good
squire
,
it
is
only
that
he
may
secure
her
for
his
own
*NL*
eating
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
often
considered
a
very
fine
young
woman
of
fortune
and
*NL*
fashion
,
when
first
found
strayed
from
the
pale
of
her
nursery
,
to
be
*NL*
in
pretty
much
the
same
situation
with
this
doe
.
The
town
is
*NL*
immediately
in
an
uproar
;
she
is
hunted
from
park
to
play
,
from
court
*NL*
to
assembly
,
from
assembly
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
rarely
escapes
a
*NL*
single
season
from
the
jaws
of
some
devourer
or
other
;
for
,
if
her
*NL*
friends
protect
her
from
some
,
it
is
only
to
deliver
her
over
to
one
*NL*
of
their
own
chusing
,
often
more
disagreeable
to
her
than
any
of
the
*NL*
rest
;
while
whole
herds
or
flocks
of
other
women
securely
,
and
scarce
*NL*
regarded
,
traverse
the
park
,
the
play
,
the
opera
,
and
the
assembly
;
*NL*
and
though
,
for
the
most
part
at
least
,
they
are
at
last
devoured
,
yet
*NL*
for
a
long
time
do
they
wanton
in
liberty
,
without
disturbance
or
*NL*
controul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
these
paragons
none
ever
tasted
more
of
this
persecution
than
*NL*
poor
Sophia
.
Her
ill
stars
were
not
contented
with
all
that
she
had
*NL*
suffered
on
account
of
Blifil
,
they
now
raised
her
another
pursuer
,
*NL*
who
seemed
likely
to
torment
her
no
less
than
the
other
had
done
.
For
*NL*
though
her
aunt
was
less
violent
,
she
was
no
less
assiduous
in
teizing
*NL*
her
,
than
her
father
had
been
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servants
were
no
sooner
departed
after
dinner
than
Mrs
Western
,
*NL*
who
had
opened
the
matter
to
Sophia
,
informed
her
,
``
That
she
expected
*NL*
his
lordship
that
very
afternoon
,
and
intended
to
take
the
first
*NL*
opportunity
of
leaving
her
alone
with
him
.
''
``
If
you
do
,
madam
,
''
*NL*
answered
Sophia
,
with
some
spirit
,
``
I
shall
take
the
first
opportunity
*NL*
of
leaving
him
by
himself
.
''
``
How
!
madam
!
''
cries
the
aunt
;
``
is
this
the
*NL*
return
you
make
me
for
my
kindness
in
relieving
you
from
your
*NL*
confinement
at
your
father
's
?
''
``
You
know
,
madam
,
''
said
Sophia
,
``
the
*NL*
cause
of
that
confinement
was
a
refusal
to
comply
with
my
father
in
*NL*
accepting
a
man
I
detested
;
and
will
my
dear
aunt
,
who
hath
relieved
*NL*
me
from
that
distress
,
involve
me
in
another
equally
bad
?
''
``
And
do
you
*NL*
think
then
,
madam
,
''
answered
Mrs
Western
,
``
that
there
is
no
difference
*NL*
between
my
Lord
Fellamar
and
Mr
Blifil
?
''
``
Very
little
,
in
my
opinion
,
''
*NL*
cries
Sophia
;
``
and
,
if
I
must
be
condemned
to
one
,
I
would
certainly
*NL*
have
the
merit
of
sacrificing
myself
to
my
father
's
pleasure
.
''
``
Then
*NL*
my
pleasure
,
I
find
,
''
said
the
aunt
,
``
hath
very
little
weight
with
*NL*
you
;
but
that
consideration
shall
not
move
me
.
I
act
from
nobler
*NL*
motives
.
The
view
of
aggrandizing
my
family
,
of
ennobling
yourself
,
is
*NL*
what
I
proceed
upon
.
Have
you
no
sense
of
ambition
?
Are
there
no
*NL*
charms
in
the
thoughts
of
having
a
coronet
on
your
coach
?
''
``
None
,
upon
*NL*
my
honour
,
''
said
Sophia
.
``
A
pincushion
upon
my
coach
would
please
me
*NL*
just
as
well
.
''
``
Never
mention
honour
,
''
cries
the
aunt
.
``
It
becomes
not
*NL*
the
mouth
of
such
a
wretch
.
I
am
sorry
,
niece
,
you
force
me
to
use
*NL*
these
words
,
but
I
can
not
bear
your
groveling
temper
;
you
have
none
of
*NL*
the
blood
of
the
Westerns
in
you
.
But
,
however
mean
and
base
your
own
*NL*
ideas
are
,
you
shall
bring
no
imputation
on
mine
.
I
will
never
suffer
*NL*
the
world
to
say
of
me
that
I
encouraged
you
in
refusing
one
of
the
*NL*
best
matches
in
England
;
a
match
which
,
besides
its
advantage
in
*NL*
fortune
,
would
do
honour
to
almost
any
family
,
and
hath
,
indeed
,
in
*NL*
title
,
the
advantage
of
ours
.
''
``
Surely
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
I
am
born
*NL*
deficient
,
and
have
not
the
senses
with
which
other
people
are
*NL*
blessed
;
there
must
be
certainly
some
sense
which
can
relish
the
*NL*
delights
of
sound
and
show
,
which
I
have
not
;
for
surely
mankind
would
*NL*
not
labour
so
much
,
nor
sacrifice
so
much
for
the
obtaining
,
nor
would
*NL*
they
be
so
elate
and
proud
with
possessing
,
what
appeared
to
them
,
as
*NL*
it
doth
to
me
,
the
most
insignificant
of
all
trifles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
miss
,
''
cries
the
aunt
;
``
you
are
born
with
as
many
senses

*NL*
other

I
assure

I
declare
this

henceforth
interfere
*NL*
with
you
,
nor
see
your
face
again
.
''
Sophia
stood
a
few
moments
silent
*NL*
after
this
speech
,
which
was
uttered
in
a
most
angry
and
peremptory
*NL*
tone
;
and
then
,
bursting
into
tears
,
she
cryed
,
``
Do
with
me
,
madam
,
*NL*
whatever
you
please
;
I
am
the
most
miserable
undone
wretch
upon
earth
;
*NL*
if
my
dear
aunt
forsakes
me
where
shall
I
look
for
a
protector
?
''
``
My
*NL*
dear
niece
,
''
cries
she
,
``
you
will
have
a
very
good
protector
in
his
*NL*
lordship
;
a
protector
whom
nothing
but
a
hankering
after
that
vile
*NL*
fellow
Jones
can
make
you
decline
.
''
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
said
Sophia
,
``
you
*NL*
wrong
me
.
How
can
you
imagine
,
after
what
you
have
shewn
me
,
if
I
had
*NL*
ever
any
such
thoughts
,
that
I
should
not
banish
them
for
ever
?
If
it
*NL*
will
satisfy
you
,
I
will
receive
the
sacrament
upon
it
never
to
see
*NL*
his
face
again
.
''
``
But
,
child
,
dear
child
,
''
said
the
aunt
,
``
be
*NL*
reasonable
;
can
you
invent
a
single
objection
?
''
``
I
have
already
,
I
*NL*
think
,
told
you
a
sufficient
objection
,
''
answered
Sophia
.
``
What
?
''
*NL*
cries
the
aunt
;
``
I
remember
none
.
''
``
Sure
,
madam
,
''
said
Sophia
,
``
I
told
*NL*
you
he
had
used
me
in
the
rudest
and
vilest
manner
.
''
``
Indeed
,
child
,
''
*NL*
answered
she
,
``
I
never
heard
you
,
or
did
not
understand
you
:
--
but
what
*NL*
do
you
mean
by
this
rude
,
vile
manner
?
''
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
said
Sophia
,
*NL*
``
I
am
almost
ashamed
to
tell
you
.
He
caught
me
in
his
arms
,
pulled
me
*NL*
down
upon
the
settee
,
and
thrust
his
hand
into
my
bosom
,
and
kissed
it
*NL*
with
such
violence
that
I
have
the
mark
upon
my
left
breast
at
this
*NL*
moment
.
''
``
Indeed
!
''
said
Mrs
Western
.
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
madam
,
''
answered
*NL*
Sophia
;
``
my
father
luckily
came
in
at
that
instant
,
or
Heaven
knows
*NL*
what
rudeness
he
intended
to
have
proceeded
to
.
''
``
I
am
astonished
and
*NL*
confounded
,
''
cries
the
aunt
.
``
No
woman
of
the
name
of
Western
hath
*NL*
been
ever
treated
so
since
we
were
a
family
.
I
would
have
torn
the
*NL*
eyes
of
a
prince
out
,
if
he
had
attempted
such
freedoms
with
me
.
It
is
*NL*
impossible
!
sure
,
Sophia
,
you
must
invent
this
to
raise
my
indignation
*NL*
against
him
.
''
``
I
hope
,
madam
,
''
said
Sophia
,
``
you
have
too
good
an
*NL*
opinion
of
me
to
imagine
me
capable
of
telling
an
untruth
.
Upon
my
*NL*
soul
it
is
true
.
''
``
I
should
have
stabbed
him
to
the
heart
,
had
I
been
*NL*
present
,
''
returned
the
aunt
.
``
Yet
surely
he
could
have
no
*NL*
dishonourable
design
;
it
is
impossible
!
he
durst
not
:
besides
,
his
*NL*
proposals
shew
he
hath
not
;
for
they
are
not
only
honourable
,
but
*NL*
generous
.
I
do
n't
know
;
the
age
allows
too
great
freedoms
.
A
distant
*NL*
salute
is
all
I
would
have
allowed
before
the
ceremony
.
I
have
had
*NL*
lovers
formerly
,
not
so
long
ago
neither
;
several
lovers
,
though
I
*NL*
never
would
consent
to
marriage
,
and
I
never
encouraged
the
least
*NL*
freedom
.
It
is
a
foolish
custom
,
and
what
I
never
would
agree
to
.
No
*NL*
man
kissed
more
of
me
than
my
cheek
.
It
is
as
much
as
one
can
bring
*NL*
oneself
to
give
lips
up
to
a
husband
;
and
,
indeed
,
could
I
ever
have
*NL*
been
persuaded
to
marry
,
I
believe
I
should
not
have
soon
been
brought
*NL*
to
endure
so
much
.
''
``
You
will
pardon
me
,
dear
madam
,
''
said
Sophia
,
``
if
*NL*
I
make
one
observation
:
you
own
you
have
had
many
lovers
,
and
the
*NL*
world
knows
it
,
even
if
you
should
deny
it
.
You
refused
them
all
,
and
,
*NL*
I
am
convinced
,
one
coronet
at
least
among
them
.
''
``
You
say
true
,
dear
*NL*
Sophy
,
''
answered
she
;
``
I
had
once
the
offer
of
a
title
.
''
``
Why
,
then
,
''
*NL*
said
Sophia
,
``
will
you
not
suffer
me
to
refuse
this
once
?
''
``
It
is
*NL*
true
,
child
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
have
refused
the
offer
of
a
title
;

it
*NL*
was
not
so
good
an

not

very
,
very
good
an
*NL*
offer

''
--
``
Yes
,
madam
,
''
said
Sophia
;
``
but
you
have
had
very
great
*NL*
proposals
from
men
of
vast
fortunes
.
It
was
not
the
first
,
nor
the
*NL*
second
,
nor
the
third
advantageous
match
that
offered
itself
.
''
``
I
own
*NL*
it
was
not
,
''
said
she
.
``
Well
,
madam
,
''
continued
Sophia
,
``
and
why
may
*NL*
not
I
expect
to
have
a
second

perhaps

better
than
this
?
You
are
now
*NL*
but
a
young
woman
,
and
I
am
convinced
would
not
promise
to
yield
to
*NL*
the
first
lover
of
fortune
,
nay
,
or
of
title
too
.
I
am
a
very
young
*NL*
woman
,
and
sure
I
need
not
despair
.
''
``
Well
,
my
dear
,
dear
Sophy
,
''
*NL*
cries
the
aunt
,
``
what
would
you
have
me
say
?
''
``
Why
,
I
only
beg
that
I
*NL*
may
not
be
left
alone
,
at
least
this
evening
;
grant
me
that
,
and
I
*NL*
will
submit
,
if
you
think
,
after
what
is
past
,
I
ought
to
see
him
in
*NL*
your
company
.
''
``
Well
,
I
will
grant
it
,
''
cries
the
aunt
.
``
Sophy
,
you
*NL*
know
I
love
you
,
and
can
deny
you
nothing
.
You
know
the
easiness
of
my
*NL*
nature
;
I
have
not
always
been
so
easy
.
I
have
been
formerly
thought
*NL*
cruel
;
by
the
men
,
I
mean
.
I
was
called
the
cruel
Parthenissa
.
I
have
*NL*
broke
many
a
window
that
has
had
verses
to
the
cruel
Parthenissa
in
*NL*
it
.
Sophy
,
I
was
never
so
handsome
as
you
,
and
yet
I
had
something
of
*NL*
you
formerly
.
I
am
a
little
altered
.
Kingdoms
and
states
,
as
Tully
*NL*
Cicero
says
in
his
epistles
,
undergo
alterations
,
and
so
must
the
*NL*
human
form
.
''
Thus
run
she
on
for
near
half
an
hour
upon
herself
,
and
*NL*
her
conquests
,
and
her
cruelty
,
till
the
arrival
of
my
lord
,
who
,
*NL*
after
a
most
tedious
visit
,
during
which
Mrs
Western
never
once
*NL*
offered
to
leave
the
room
,
retired
,
not
much
more
satisfied
with
the
*NL*
aunt
than
with
the
niece
;
for
Sophia
had
brought
her
aunt
into
so
*NL*
excellent
a
temper
,
that
she
consented
to
almost
everything
her
niece
*NL*
said
;
and
agreed
that
a
little
distant
behaviour
might
not
be
improper
*NL*
to
so
forward
a
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Sophia
,
by
a
little
well-directed
flattery
,
for
which
surely
none
*NL*
will
blame
her
,
obtained
a
little
ease
for
herself
,
and
,
at
least
,
put
*NL*
off
the
evil
day
.
And
now
we
have
seen
our
heroine
in
a
better
*NL*
situation
than
she
hath
been
for
a
long
time
before
,
we
will
look
a
*NL*
little
after
Mr
Jones
,
whom
we
left
in
the
most
deplorable
situation
*NL*
that
can
be
well
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
v.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
and
Mr
Nightingale
visit
Jones
in
the
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr
Allworthy
and
his
nephew
went
to
meet
Mr
Western
,
Mrs
Miller
*NL*
set
forwards
to
her
son-in-law
's
lodgings
,
in
order
to
acquaint
him
*NL*
with
the
accident
which
had
befallen
his
friend
Jones
;
but
he
had
*NL*
known
it
long
before
from
Partridge
-LRB-
for
Jones
,
when
he
left
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
,
had
been
furnished
with
a
room
in
the
same
house
with
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
-RRB-
.
The
good
woman
found
her
daughter
under
great
affliction
*NL*
on
account
of
Mr
Jones
,
whom
having
comforted
as
well
as
she
could
,
*NL*
she
set
forwards
to
the
Gatehouse
,
where
she
heard
he
was
,
and
where
*NL*
Mr
Nightingale
was
arrived
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
firmness
and
constancy
of
a
true
friend
is
a
circumstance
so
*NL*
extremely
delightful
to
persons
in
any
kind
of
distress
,
that
the
*NL*
distress
itself
,
if
it
be
only
temporary
,
and
admits
of
relief
,
is
*NL*
more
than
compensated
by
bringing
this
comfort
with
it
.
Nor
are
*NL*
instances
of
this
kind
so
rare
as
some
superficial
and
inaccurate
*NL*
observers
have
reported
.
To
say
the
truth
,
want
of
compassion
is
not
*NL*
to
be
numbered
among
our
general
faults
.
The
black
ingredient
which
*NL*
fouls
our
disposition
is
envy
.
Hence
our
eye
is
seldom
,
I
am
afraid
,
*NL*
turned
upward
to
those
who
are
manifestly
greater
,
better
,
wiser
,
or
*NL*
happier
than
ourselves
,
without
some
degree
of
malignity
;
while
we
*NL*
commonly
look
downwards
on
the
mean
and
miserable
with
sufficient
*NL*
benevolence
and
pity
.
In
fact
,
I
have
remarked
,
that
most
of
the
*NL*
defects
which
have
discovered
themselves
in
the
friendships
within
my
*NL*
observation
have
arisen
from
envy
only
:
a
hellish
vice
;
and
yet
one
*NL*
from
which
I
have
known
very
few
absolutely
exempt
.
But
enough
of
a
*NL*
subject
which
,
if
pursued
,
would
lead
me
too
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
that
Fortune
was
apprehensive
lest
Jones
should
sink
*NL*
under
the
weight
of
his
adversity
,
and
that
she
might
thus
lose
any
*NL*
future
opportunity
of
tormenting
him
,
or
whether
she
really
abated
*NL*
somewhat
of
her
severity
towards
him
,
she
seemed
a
little
to
relax
her
*NL*
persecution
,
by
sending
him
the
company
of
two
such
faithful
friends
,
*NL*
and
what
is
perhaps
more
rare
,
a
faithful
servant
.
For
Partridge
,
*NL*
though
he
had
many
imperfections
,
wanted
not
fidelity
;
and
though
fear
*NL*
would
not
suffer
him
to
be
hanged
for
his
master
,
yet
the
world
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
could
not
have
bribed
him
to
desert
his
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Jones
was
expressing
great
satisfaction
in
the
presence
of
his
*NL*
friends
,
Partridge
brought
an
account
that
Mr
Fitzpatrick
was
still
*NL*
alive
,
though
the
surgeon
declared
that
he
had
very
little
hopes
.
Upon
*NL*
which
,
Jones
fetching
a
deep
sigh
,
Nightingale
said
to
him
,
``
My
dear
*NL*
Tom
,
why
should
you
afflict
yourself
so
upon
an
accident
,
which
,
*NL*
whatever
be
the
consequence
,
can
be
attended
with
no
danger
to
you
,
*NL*
and
in
which
your
conscience
can
not
accuse
you
of
having
been
the
*NL*
least
to
blame
?
If
the
fellow
should
die
,
what
have
you
done
more
than
*NL*
taken
away
the
life
of
a
ruffian
in
your
own
defence
?
So
will
the
*NL*
coroner
's
inquest
certainly
find
it
;
and
then
you
will
be
easily
*NL*
admitted
to
bail
;
and
,
though
you
must
undergo
the
form
of
a
trial
,
*NL*
yet
it
is
a
trial
which
many
men
would
stand
for
you
for
a
shilling
.
''
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
Mr
Jones
,
''
says
Mrs
Miller
,
``
chear
yourself
up
.
I
knew
*NL*
you
could
not
be
the
aggressor
,
and
so
I
told
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
so
he
*NL*
shall
acknowledge
too
,
before
I
have
done
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
gravely
answered
,
``
That
whatever
might
be
his
fate
,
he
*NL*
should
always
lament
the
having
shed
the
blood
of
one
of
his
*NL*
fellow-creatures
,
as
one
of
the
highest
misfortunes
which
could
*NL*
have
befallen
him
.
But
I
have
another
misfortune
of
the
tenderest
*NL*
kind
--
O
!
Mrs
Miller
,
I
have
lost
what
I
held
most
dear
upon
earth
.
''
*NL*
``
That
must
be
a
mistress
,
''
said
Mrs
Miller
;
``
but
come
,
come
;
I
know
*NL*
more
than
you
imagine
''
-LRB-
for
indeed
Partridge
had
blabbed
all
-RRB-
;
``
and
I
*NL*
have
heard
more
than
you
know
.
Matters
go
better
,
I
promise
you
,
than
*NL*
you
think
;
and
I
would
not
give
Blifil
sixpence
for
all
the
chance
*NL*
which
he
hath
of
the
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
my
dear
friend
,
indeed
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
you
are
an
entire
*NL*
stranger
to
the
cause
of
my
grief
.
If
you
was
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
story
,
you
would
allow
my
case
admitted
of
no
comfort
.
I
apprehend
no
*NL*
danger
from
Blifil
.
I
have
undone
myself
.
''
``
Do
n't
despair
,
''
replied
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
;
``
you
know
not
what
a
woman
can
do
;

if
anything
be
in

my

I
will
do

so
kind
to
tell
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou

cries
Jones
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
,
``
talk
not

you

Give
it

said
Mrs
Miller
.
``
If
I
see
it
not
in
her
own
possession
*NL*
before
I
sleep

may
my
next
sleep

my

Comfort
yourself

my
*NL*
good
young

wise
enough
to
take
warning
from
past
follies

*NL*
I
warrant
all
shall
be
well
,
and
I
shall
yet
see
you
happy
with
the
*NL*
most
charming
young
lady
in
the
world
;
for
I
so
hear
from
every
one
*NL*
she
is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
me
,
madam
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
do
not
speak
the
common
cant
of
one
*NL*
in
my
unhappy
situation
.
Before
this
dreadful
accident
happened
,
I
had
*NL*
resolved
to
quit
a
life
of
which
I
was
become
sensible
of
the
*NL*
wickedness
as
well
as
folly
.
I
do
assure
you
,
notwithstanding
the
*NL*
disturbances
I
have
unfortunately
occasioned
in
your
house
,
for
which
*NL*
I
heartily
ask
your
pardon
,
I
am
not
an
abandoned
profligate
.
Though
I
*NL*
have
been
hurried
into
vices
,
I
do
not
approve
a
vicious
character
,
*NL*
nor
will
I
ever
,
from
this
moment
,
deserve
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
expressed
great
satisfaction
in
these
declarations
,
in
the
*NL*
sincerity
of
which
she
averred
she
had
an
entire
faith
;
and
now
the
*NL*
remainder
of
the
conversation
past
in
the
joint
attempts
of
that
good
*NL*
woman
and
Mr
Nightingale
to
cheer
the
dejected
spirits
of
Mr
Jones
,
in
*NL*
which
they
so
far
succeeded
as
to
leave
him
much
better
comforted
and
*NL*
satisfied
than
they
found
him
;
to
which
happy
alteration
nothing
so
*NL*
much
contributed
as
the
kind
undertaking
of
Mrs
Miller
to
deliver
his
*NL*
letter
to
Sophia
,
which
he
despaired
of
finding
any
means
to
*NL*
accomplish
;
for
when
Black
George
produced
the
last
from
Sophia
,
he
*NL*
informed
Partridge
that
she
had
strictly
charged
him
,
on
pain
of
*NL*
having
it
communicated
to
her
father
,
not
to
bring
her
any
answer
.
He
*NL*
was
,
moreover
,
not
a
little
pleased
to
find
he
had
so
warm
an
advocate
*NL*
to
Mr
Allworthy
himself
in
this
good
woman
,
who
was
,
in
reality
,
one
*NL*
of
the
worthiest
creatures
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
about
an
hour
's
visit
from
the
lady
-LRB-
for
Nightingale
had
been
*NL*
with
him
much
longer
-RRB-
,
they
both
took
their
leave
,
promising
to
return
*NL*
to
him
soon
;
during
which
Mrs
Miller
said
she
hoped
to
bring
him
some
*NL*
good
news
from
his
mistress
,
and
Mr
Nightingale
promised
to
enquire
*NL*
into
the
state
of
Mr
Fitzpatrick
's
wound
,
and
likewise
to
find
out
*NL*
some
of
the
persons
who
were
present
at
the
rencounter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
former
of
these
went
directly
in
quest
of
Sophia
,
whither
we
*NL*
likewise
shall
now
attend
her
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
In
which
Mrs
Miller
pays
a
visit
to
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Access
to
the
young
lady
was
by
no
means
difficult
;
for
,
as
she
lived
*NL*
now
on
a
perfect
friendly
footing
with
her
aunt
,
she
was
at
full
*NL*
liberty
to
receive
what
visitants
she
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
was
dressing
when
she
was
acquainted
that
there
was
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
below
to
wait
on
her
.
As
she
was
neither
afraid
,
nor
*NL*
ashamed
,
to
see
any
of
her
own
sex
,
Mrs
Miller
was
immediately
*NL*
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curtsies
and
the
usual
ceremonials
between
women
who
are
strangers
to
*NL*
each
other
,
being
past
,
Sophia
said
,
``
I
have
not
the
pleasure
to
know
*NL*
you
,
madam
.
''
``
No
,
madam
,
''
answered
Mrs
Miller
,
``
and
I
must
beg
pardon
*NL*
for
intruding
upon
you
.
But
when
you
know
what
has
induced
me
to
give
*NL*
you
this
trouble
,
I
hope
--
''
``
Pray
,
what
is
your
business
,
madam
?
''
*NL*
said
Sophia
,
with
a
little
emotion
.
``
Madam
,
we
are
not
alone
,
''
replied
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
,
in
a
low
voice
.
``
Go
out
,
Betty
,
''
said
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Betty
was
departed
,
Mrs
Miller
said
,
``
I
was
desired
,
madam
,
by
a
*NL*
very
unhappy
young
gentleman
,
to
deliver
you
this
letter
.
''
Sophia
*NL*
changed
colour
when
she
saw
the
direction
,
well
knowing
the
hand
,
and
*NL*
after
some
hesitation
,
said
--
``
I
could
not
conceive
,
madam
,
from
your
*NL*
appearance
,
that
your
business
had
been
of
such
a
nature
.
--
Whomever
*NL*
you
brought
this
letter
from
,
I
shall
not
open
it
.
I
should
be
sorry
*NL*
to
entertain
an
unjust
suspicion
of
any
one
;
but
you
are
an
utter
*NL*
stranger
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
have
patience
,
madam
,
''
answered
Mrs
Miller
,
``
I
will
*NL*
acquaint
you
who
I
am
,
and
how
I
came
by
that
letter
.
''
``
I
have
no
*NL*
curiosity
,
madam
,
to
know
anything
,
''
cries
Sophia
;
``
but
I
must
insist
*NL*
on
your
delivering
that
letter
back
to
the
person
who
gave
it
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
then
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
in
the
most
passionate
terms
*NL*
implored
her
compassion
;
to
which
Sophia
answered
:
``
Sure
,
madam
,
it
is
*NL*
surprizing
you
should
be
so
very
strongly
interested
in
the
behalf
of
*NL*
this
person
.
I
would
not
think
,
madam
''
--
``
No
,
madam
,
''
says
Mrs
Miller
,
*NL*
``
you
shall
not
think
anything
but
the
truth
.
I
will
tell
you
all
,
and
*NL*
you
will
not
wonder
that
I
am
interested
.
He
is
the
best-natured
*NL*
creature
that
ever
was
born
.
''
--
She
then
began
and
related
the
story
of
*NL*
Mr
Anderson
.
--
After
this
she
cried
,
``
This
,
madam
,
this
is
his
*NL*
goodness
;
but
I
have
much
more
tender
obligations
to
him
.
He
hath
*NL*
preserved
my
child
.
''
--
Here
,
after
shedding
some
tears
,
she
related
*NL*
everything
concerning
that
fact
,
suppressing
only
those
circumstances
*NL*
which
would
have
most
reflected
on
her
daughter
,
and
concluded
with
*NL*
saying
,
``
Now
,
madam
,
you
shall
judge
whether
I
can
ever
do
enough
for
*NL*
so
kind
,
so
good
,
so
generous
a
young
man
;
and
sure
he
is
the
best
and
*NL*
worthiest
of
all
human
beings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
alterations
in
the
countenance
of
Sophia
had
hitherto
been
chiefly
*NL*
to
her
disadvantage
,
and
had
inclined
her
complexion
to
too
great
*NL*
paleness
;
but
she
now
waxed
redder
,
if
possible
,
than
vermilion
,
and
*NL*
cried
,
``
I
know
not
what
to
say
;
certainly
what
arises
from
gratitude
*NL*
can
not
be
blamed
--
But
what
service
can
my
reading
this
letter
do
your
*NL*
friend
,
since
I
am
resolved
never
--
''
Mrs
Miller
fell
again
to
her
*NL*
entreaties
,
and
begged
to
be
forgiven
,
but
she
could
not
,
she
said
,
*NL*
carry
it
back
.
``
Well
,
madam
,
''
says
Sophia
,
``
I
can
not
help
it
,
if
you
*NL*
will
force
it
upon
me
.
--
Certainly
you
may
leave
it
whether
I
will
or
*NL*
no
.
''
What
Sophia
meant
,
or
whether
she
meant
anything
,
I
will
not
*NL*
presume
to
determine
;
but
Mrs
Miller
actually
understood
this
as
a
*NL*
hint
,
and
presently
laying
the
letter
down
on
the
table
,
took
her
*NL*
leave
,
having
first
begged
permission
to
wait
again
on
Sophia
;
which
*NL*
request
had
neither
assent
nor
denial
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
lay
upon
the
table
no
longer
than
till
Mrs
Miller
was
out
*NL*
of
sight
;
for
then
Sophia
opened
and
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
did
very
little
service
to
his
cause
;
for
it
consisted
of
*NL*
little
more
than
confessions
of
his
own
unworthiness
,
and
bitter
*NL*
lamentations
of
despair
,
together
with
the
most
solemn
protestations
*NL*
of
his
unalterable
fidelity
to
Sophia
,
of
which
,
he
said
,
he
hoped
to
*NL*
convince
her
,
if
he
had
ever
more
the
honour
of
being
admitted
to
her
*NL*
presence
;
and
that
he
could
account
for
the
letter
to
Lady
Bellaston
*NL*
in
such
a
manner
,
that
,
though
it
would
not
entitle
him
to
her
*NL*
forgiveness
,
he
hoped
at
least
to
obtain
it
from
her
mercy
.
And
*NL*
concluded
with
vowing
that
nothing
was
ever
less
in
his
thoughts
than
*NL*
to
marry
Lady
Bellaston
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Sophia
read
the
letter
twice
over
with
great
attention
,
his
*NL*
meaning
still
remained
a
riddle
to
her
;
nor
could
her
invention
*NL*
suggest
to
her
any
means
to
excuse
Jones
.
She
certainly
remained
very
*NL*
angry
with
him
,
though
indeed
Lady
Bellaston
took
up
so
much
of
her
*NL*
resentment
,
that
her
gentle
mind
had
but
little
left
to
bestow
on
any
*NL*
other
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
lady
was
most
unluckily
to
dine
this
very
day
with
her
aunt
*NL*
Western
,
and
in
the
afternoon
they
were
all
three
,
by
appointment
,
to
*NL*
go
together
to
the
opera
,
and
thence
to
Lady
Thomas
Hatchet
's
drum
.
*NL*
Sophia
would
have
gladly
been
excused
from
all
,
but
would
not
*NL*
disoblige
her
aunt
;
and
as
to
the
arts
of
counterfeiting
illness
,
she
*NL*
was
so
entirely
a
stranger
to
them
,
that
it
never
once
entered
into
*NL*
her
head
.
When
she
was
drest
,
therefore
,
down
she
went
,
resolved
to
*NL*
encounter
all
the
horrors
of
the
day
,
and
a
most
disagreeable
one
it
*NL*
proved
;
for
Lady
Bellaston
took
every
opportunity
very
civilly
and
*NL*
slily
to
insult
her
;
to
all
which
her
dejection
of
spirits
disabled
*NL*
her
from
making
any
return
;
and
,
indeed
,
to
confess
the
truth
,
she
was
*NL*
at
the
very
best
but
an
indifferent
mistress
of
repartee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
misfortune
which
befel
poor
Sophia
was
the
company
of
Lord
*NL*
Fellamar
,
whom
she
met
at
the
opera
,
and
who
attended
her
to
the
drum
.
*NL*
And
though
both
places
were
too
publick
to
admit
of
any
*NL*
particularities
,
and
she
was
farther
relieved
by
the
musick
at
the
one
*NL*
place
,
and
by
the
cards
at
the
other
,
she
could
not
,
however
,
enjoy
*NL*
herself
in
his
company
;
for
there
is
something
of
delicacy
in
women
,
*NL*
which
will
not
suffer
them
to
be
even
easy
in
the
presence
of
a
man
*NL*
whom
they
know
to
have
pretensions
to
them
which
they
are
disinclined
*NL*
to
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
in
this
chapter
twice
mentioned
a
drum
,
a
word
which
our
*NL*
posterity
,
it
is
hoped
,
will
not
understand
in
the
sense
it
is
here
*NL*
applied
,
we
shall
,
notwithstanding
our
present
haste
,
stop
a
moment
to
*NL*
describe
the
entertainment
here
meant
,
and
the
rather
as
we
can
in
a
*NL*
moment
describe
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
drum
,
then
,
is
an
assembly
of
well-dressed
persons
of
both
sexes
,
*NL*
most
of
whom
play
at
cards
,
and
the
rest
do
nothing
at
all
;
while
the
*NL*
mistress
of
the
house
performs
the
part
of
the
landlady
at
an
inn
,
and
*NL*
like
the
landlady
of
an
inn
prides
herself
in
the
number
of
her
*NL*
guests
,
though
she
doth
not
always
,
like
her
,
get
anything
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
wonder
then
,
as
so
much
spirits
must
be
required
to
support
any
*NL*
vivacity
in
these
scenes
of
dulness
,
that
we
hear
persons
of
fashion
*NL*
eternally
complaining
of
the
want
of
them
;
a
complaint
confined
*NL*
entirely
to
upper
life
.
How
insupportable
must
we
imagine
this
round
*NL*
of
impertinence
to
have
been
to
Sophia
at
this
time
;
how
difficult
*NL*
must
she
have
found
it
to
force
the
appearance
of
gaiety
into
her
*NL*
looks
,
when
her
mind
dictated
nothing
but
the
tenderest
sorrow
,
and
*NL*
when
every
thought
was
charged
with
tormenting
ideas
!
*NL*
*NL*
Night
,
however
,
at
last
restored
her
to
her
pillow
,
where
we
will
*NL*
leave
her
to
soothe
her
melancholy
at
least
,
though
incapable
we
fear
*NL*
of
rest
,
and
shall
pursue
our
history
,
which
,
something
whispers
us
,
*NL*
is
now
arrived
at
the
eve
of
some
great
event
.

Chapter
vii
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
pathetic
scene
between
Mr
Allworthy
and
Mrs
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
had
a
long
discourse
with
Mr
Allworthy
,
at
his
return
from
*NL*
dinner
,
in
which
she
acquainted
him
with
Jones
's
having
unfortunately
*NL*
lost
all
which
he
was
pleased
to
bestow
on
him
at
their
separation
;
*NL*
and
with
the
distresses
to
which
that
loss
had
subjected
him
;
of
all
*NL*
which
she
had
received
a
full
account
from
the
faithful
retailer
*NL*
Partridge
.
She
then
explained
the
obligations
she
had
to
Jones
;
not
*NL*
that
she
was
entirely
explicit
with
regard
to
her
daughter
;
for
though
*NL*
she
had
the
utmost
confidence
in
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
though
there
could
*NL*
be
no
hopes
of
keeping
an
affair
secret
which
was
unhappily
known
to
*NL*
more
than
half
a
dozen
,
yet
she
could
not
prevail
with
herself
to
*NL*
mention
those
circumstances
which
reflected
most
on
the
chastity
of
*NL*
poor
Nancy
,
but
smothered
that
part
of
her
evidence
as
cautiously
as
*NL*
if
she
had
been
before
a
judge
,
and
the
girl
was
now
on
her
trial
for
*NL*
the
murder
of
a
bastard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
said
,
there
were
few
characters
so
absolutely
vicious
as
not
*NL*
to
have
the
least
mixture
of
good
in
them
.
``
However
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
*NL*
can
not
deny
but
that
you
have
some
obligations
to
the
fellow
,
bad
as
*NL*
he
is
,
and
I
shall
therefore
excuse
what
hath
past
already
,
but
must
*NL*
insist
you
never
mention
his
name
to
me
more
;
for
,
I
promise
you
,
it
*NL*
was
upon
the
fullest
and
plainest
evidence
that
I
resolved
to
take
the
*NL*
measures
I
have
taken
.
''
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
make
not
the
least
*NL*
doubt
but
time
will
shew
all
matters
in
their
true
and
natural
*NL*
colours
,
and
that
you
will
be
convinced
this
poor
young
man
deserves
*NL*
better
of
you
than
some
other
folks
that
shall
be
nameless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
''
cries
Allworthy
,
a
little
ruffled
,
``
I
will
not
hear
any
*NL*
reflections
on
my
nephew
;
and
if
ever
you
say
a
word
more
of
that
*NL*
kind
,
I
will
depart
from
your
house
that
instant
.
He
is
the
worthiest
*NL*
and
best
of
men
;
and
I
once
more
repeat
it
to
you
,
he
hath
carried
his
*NL*
friendship
to
this
man
to
a
blameable
length
,
by
too
long
concealing
*NL*
facts
of
the
blackest
die
.
The
ingratitude
of
the
wretch
to
this
good
*NL*
young
man
is
what
I
most
resent
;
for
,
madam
,
I
have
the
greatest
*NL*
reason
to
imagine
he
had
laid
a
plot
to
supplant
my
nephew
in
my
*NL*
favour
,
and
to
have
disinherited
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
sir
,
''
answered
Mrs
Miller
,
a
little
frightened
-LRB-
for
,
*NL*
though
Mr
Allworthy
had
the
utmost
sweetness
and
benevolence
in
his
*NL*
smiles
,
he
had
great
terror
in
his
frowns
-RRB-
,
``
I
shall
never
speak
*NL*
against
any
gentleman
you
are
pleased
to
think
well
of
.
I
am
sure
,
*NL*
sir
,
such
behaviour
would
very
little
become
me
,
especially
when
the
*NL*
gentleman
is
your
nearest
relation
;
but
,
sir
,
you
must
not
be
angry
*NL*
with
me
,
you
must
not
indeed
,
for
my
good
wishes
to
this
poor
wretch
.
*NL*
Sure
I
may
call
him
so
now
,
though
once
you
would
have
been
angry
with
*NL*
me
if
I
had
spoke
of
him
with
the
least
disrespect
.
How
often
have
I
*NL*
heard
you
call
him
your
son
?
How
often
have
you
prattled
to
me
of
him
*NL*
with
all
the
fondness
of
a
parent
?
Nay
,
sir
,
I
can
not
forget
the
many
*NL*
tender
expressions
,
the
many
good
things
you
have
told
me
of
his
*NL*
beauty
,
and
his
parts
,
and
his
virtues
;
of
his
good-nature
and
*NL*
generosity
.
I
am
sure
,
sir
,
I
can
not
forget
them
,
for
I
find
them
all
*NL*
true
.
I
have
experienced
them
in
my
own
cause
.
They
have
preserved
my
*NL*
family
.
You
must
pardon
my
tears
,
sir
,
indeed
you
must
.
When
I
*NL*
consider
the
cruel
reverse
of
fortune
which
this
poor
youth
,
to
whom
I
*NL*
am
so
much
obliged
,
hath
suffered
;
when
I
consider
the
loss
of
your
*NL*
favour
,
which
I
know
he
valued
more
than
his
life
,
I
must
,
I
must
*NL*
lament
him
.
If
you
had
a
dagger
in
your
hand
,
ready
to
plunge
into
my
*NL*
heart
,
I
must
lament
the
misery
of
one
whom
you
have
loved
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
ever
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
was
pretty
much
moved
with
this
speech
,
but
it
seemed
not
to
*NL*
be
with
anger
;
for
,
after
a
short
silence
,
taking
Mrs
Miller
by
the
*NL*
hand
,
he
said
very
affectionately
to
her
,
``
Come
,
madam
,
let
us
*NL*
consider
a
little
about
your
daughter
.
I
can
not
blame
you
for
*NL*
rejoicing
in
a
match
which
promises
to
be
advantageous
to
her
,
but
you
*NL*
know
this
advantage
,
in
a
great
measure
,
depends
on
the
father
's
*NL*
reconciliation
.
I
know
Mr
Nightingale
very
well
,
and
have
formerly
had
*NL*
concerns
with
him
;
I
will
make
him
a
visit
,
and
endeavour
to
serve
you
*NL*
in
this
matter
.
I
believe
he
is
a
worldly
man
;
but
as
this
is
an
only
*NL*
son
,
and
the
thing
is
now
irretrievable
,
perhaps
he
may
in
time
be
*NL*
brought
to
reason
.
I
promise
you
I
will
do
all
I
can
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Many
were
the
acknowledgments
which
the
poor
woman
made
to
Allworthy
*NL*
for
this
kind
and
generous
offer
,
nor
could
she
refrain
from
taking
*NL*
this
occasion
again
to
express
her
gratitude
towards
Jones
,
``
to
whom
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
``
I
owe
the
opportunity
of
giving
you
,
sir
,
this
present
*NL*
trouble
.
''
Allworthy
gently
stopped
her
;
but
he
was
too
good
a
man
to
*NL*
be
really
offended
with
the
effects
of
so
noble
a
principle
as
now
*NL*
actuated
Mrs
Miller
;
and
indeed
,
had
not
this
new
affair
inflamed
his
*NL*
former
anger
against
Jones
,
it
is
possible
he
might
have
been
a
little
*NL*
softened
towards
him
,
by
the
report
of
an
action
which
malice
itself
*NL*
could
not
have
derived
from
an
evil
motive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
and
Mrs
Miller
had
been
above
an
hour
together
,
when
*NL*
their
conversation
was
put
an
end
to
by
the
arrival
of
Blifil
and
*NL*
another
person
,
which
other
person
was
no
less
than
Mr
Dowling
,
the
*NL*
attorney
,
who
was
now
become
a
great
favourite
with
Mr
Blifil
,
and
*NL*
whom
Mr
Allworthy
,
at
the
desire
of
his
nephew
,
had
made
his
steward
;
*NL*
and
had
likewise
recommended
him
to
Mr
Western
,
from
whom
the
attorney
*NL*
received
a
promise
of
being
promoted
to
the
same
office
upon
the
first
*NL*
vacancy
;
and
,
in
the
meantime
,
was
employed
in
transacting
some
*NL*
affairs
which
the
squire
then
had
in
London
in
relation
to
a
mortgage
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
principal
affair
which
then
brought
Mr
Dowling
to
town
;
*NL*
therefore
he
took
the
same
opportunity
to
charge
himself
with
some
*NL*
money
for
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
to
make
a
report
to
him
of
some
other
*NL*
business
;
in
all
which
,
as
it
was
of
much
too
dull
a
nature
to
find
*NL*
any
place
in
this
history
,
we
will
leave
the
uncle
,
nephew
,
and
their
*NL*
lawyer
concerned
,
and
resort
to
other
matters
.

*NL*
Chapter
viii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
various
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
return
to
Mr
Jones
,
we
will
take
one
more
view
of
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
that
young
lady
had
brought
her
aunt
into
great
good
humour
by
*NL*
those
soothing
methods
which
we
have
before
related
,
she
had
not
*NL*
brought
her
in
the
least
to
abate
of
her
zeal
for
the
match
with
Lord
*NL*
Fellamar
.
This
zeal
was
now
inflamed
by
Lady
Bellaston
,
who
had
told
*NL*
her
the
preceding
evening
,
that
she
was
well
satisfied
from
the
*NL*
conduct
of
Sophia
,
and
from
her
carriage
to
his
lordship
,
that
all
*NL*
delays
would
be
dangerous
,
and
that
the
only
way
to
succeed
was
to
*NL*
press
the
match
forward
with
such
rapidity
that
the
young
lady
should
*NL*
have
no
time
to
reflect
,
and
be
obliged
to
consent
while
she
scarce
*NL*
knew
what
she
did
;
in
which
manner
,
she
said
,
one-half
of
the
*NL*
marriages
among
people
of
condition
were
brought
about
.
A
fact
very
*NL*
probably
true
,
and
to
which
,
I
suppose
,
is
owing
the
mutual
tenderness
*NL*
which
afterwards
exists
among
so
many
happy
couples
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hint
of
the
same
kind
was
given
by
the
same
lady
to
Lord
Fellamar
;
*NL*
and
both
these
so
readily
embraced
the
advice
that
the
very
next
day
*NL*
was
,
at
his
lordship
's
request
,
appointed
by
Mrs
Western
for
a
private
*NL*
interview
between
the
young
parties
.
This
was
communicated
to
Sophia
*NL*
by
her
aunt
,
and
insisted
upon
in
such
high
terms
,
that
,
after
having
*NL*
urged
everything
she
possibly
could
invent
against
it
without
the
*NL*
least
effect
,
she
at
last
agreed
to
give
the
highest
instance
of
*NL*
complacence
which
any
young
lady
can
give
,
and
consented
to
see
his
*NL*
lordship
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
conversations
of
this
kind
afford
no
great
entertainment
,
we
shall
*NL*
be
excused
from
reciting
the
whole
that
past
at
this
interview
;
in
*NL*
which
,
after
his
lordship
had
made
many
declarations
of
the
most
pure
*NL*
and
ardent
passion
to
the
silent
blushing
Sophia
,
she
at
last
*NL*
collected
all
the
spirits
she
could
raise
,
and
with
a
trembling
low
*NL*
voice
said
,
``
My
lord
,
you
must
be
yourself
conscious
whether
your
*NL*
former
behaviour
to
me
hath
been
consistent
with
the
professions
you
*NL*
now
make
.
''
``
Is
there
,
''
answered
he
,
``
no
way
by
which
I
can
atone
for
*NL*
madness
?
what
I
did
I
am
afraid
must
have
too
plainly
convinced
you
,
*NL*
that
the
violence
of
love
had
deprived
me
of
my
senses
.
''
``
Indeed
,
my
*NL*
lord
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
is
in
your
power
to
give
me
a
proof
of
an
*NL*
affection
which
I
much
rather
wish
to
encourage
,
and
to
which
I
should
*NL*
think
myself
more
beholden
.
''
``
Name
it
,
madam
,
''
said
my
lord
,
very
*NL*
warmly
.
``
My
lord
,
''
says
she
,
looking
down
upon
her
fan
,
``
I
know
you
*NL*
must
be
sensible
how
uneasy
this
pretended
passion
of
yours
hath
made
*NL*
me
.
''
``
Can
you
be
so
cruel
to
call
it
pretended
?
''
says
he
.
``
Yes
,
my
*NL*
lord
,
''
answered
Sophia
,
``
all
professions
of
love
to
those
whom
we
*NL*
persecute
are
most
insulting
pretences
.
This
pursuit
of
yours
is
to
me
*NL*
a
most
cruel
persecution
:
nay
,
it
is
taking
a
most
ungenerous
*NL*
advantage
of
my
unhappy
situation
.
''
``
Most
lovely
,
most
adorable
*NL*
charmer
,
do
not
accuse
me
,
''
cries
he
,
``
of
taking
an
ungenerous
*NL*
advantage
,
while
I
have
no
thoughts
but
what
are
directed
to
your
*NL*
honour
and
interest
,
and
while
I
have
no
view
,
no
hope
,
no
ambition
,
*NL*
but
to
throw
myself
,
honour
,
fortune
,
everything
at
your
feet
.
''
``
My
*NL*
lord
,
''
says
she
,
``
it
is
that
fortune
and
those
honours
which
gave
you
*NL*
the
advantage
of
which
I
complain
.
These
are
the
charms
which
have
*NL*
seduced
my
relations
,
but
to
me
they
are
things
indifferent
.
If
your
*NL*
lordship
will
merit
my
gratitude
,
there
is
but
one
way
.
''
``
Pardon
me
,
*NL*
divine
creature
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
can
be
none
.
All
I
can
do
for
you
is
*NL*
so
much
your
due
,
and
will
give
me
so
much
pleasure
,
that
there
is
no
*NL*
room
for
your
gratitude
.
''
``
Indeed
,
my
lord
,
''
answered
she
,
``
you
may
*NL*
obtain
my
gratitude
,
my
good
opinion
,
every
kind
thought
and
wish
*NL*
which
it
is
in
my
power
to
bestow
;
nay
,
you
may
obtain
them
with
ease
,
*NL*
for
sure
to
a
generous
mind
it
must
be
easy
to
grant
my
request
.
Let
*NL*
me
beseech
you
,
then
,
to
cease
a
pursuit
in
which
you
can
never
have
*NL*
any
success
.
For
your
own
sake
as
well
as
mine
I
entreat
this
favour
;
*NL*
for
sure
you
are
too
noble
to
have
any
pleasure
in
tormenting
an
*NL*
unhappy
creature
.
What
can
your
lordship
propose
but
uneasiness
to
*NL*
yourself
,
by
a
perseverance
,
which
,
upon
my
honour
,
upon
my
soul
,
*NL*
can
not
,
shall
not
prevail
with
me
,
whatever
distresses
you
may
drive
*NL*
me
to
.
''
Here
my
lord
fetched
a
deep
sigh
,
and
then
said
--
``
Is
it
then
,
*NL*
madam
,
that
I
am
so
unhappy
to
be
the
object
of
your
dislike
and
*NL*
scorn
;
or
will
you
pardon
me
if
I
suspect
there
is
some
other
?
''
Here
*NL*
he
hesitated
,
and
Sophia
answered
with
some
spirit
,
``
My
lord
,
I
shall
*NL*
not
be
accountable
to
you
for
the
reasons
of
my
conduct
.
I
am
obliged
*NL*
to
your
lordship
for
the
generous
offer
you
have
made
;
I
own
it
is
*NL*
beyond
either
my
deserts
or
expectations
;
yet
I
hope
,
my
lord
,
you
*NL*
will
not
insist
on
my
reasons
,
when
I
declare
I
can
not
accept
it
.
''
*NL*
Lord
Fellamar
returned
much
to
this
,
which
we
do
not
perfectly
*NL*
understand
,
and
perhaps
it
could
not
all
be
strictly
reconciled
either
*NL*
to
sense
or
grammar
;
but
he
concluded
his
ranting
speech
with
saying
,
*NL*
``
That
if
she
had
pre-engaged
herself
to
any
gentleman
,
however
unhappy
*NL*
it
would
make
him
,
he
should
think
himself
bound
in
honour
to
desist
.
''
*NL*
Perhaps
my
lord
laid
too
much
emphasis
on
the
word
gentleman
;
for
we
*NL*
can
not
else
well
account
for
the
indignation
with
which
he
inspired
*NL*
Sophia
,
who
,
in
her
answer
,
seemed
greatly
to
resent
some
affront
he
*NL*
had
given
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
speaking
,
with
her
voice
more
raised
than
usual
,
Mrs
*NL*
Western
came
into
the
room
,
the
fire
glaring
in
her
cheeks
,
and
the
*NL*
flames
bursting
from
her
eyes
.
``
I
am
ashamed
,
''
says
she
,
``
my
lord
,
of
*NL*
the
reception
which
you
have
met
with
.
I
assure
your
lordship
we
are
*NL*
all
sensible
of
the
honour
done
us
;
and
I
must
tell
you
,
Miss
Western
,
*NL*
the
family
expect
a
different
behaviour
from
you
.
''
Here
my
lord
*NL*
interfered
on
behalf
of
the
young
lady
,
but
to
no
purpose
;
the
aunt
*NL*
proceeded
till
Sophia
pulled
out
her
handkerchief
,
threw
herself
into
*NL*
a
chair
,
and
burst
into
a
violent
fit
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
remainder
of
the
conversation
between
Mrs
Western
and
his
*NL*
lordship
,
till
the
latter
withdrew
,
consisted
of
bitter
lamentations
*NL*
on
his
side
,
and
on
hers
of
the
strongest
assurances
that
her
niece
*NL*
should
and
would
consent
to
all
he
wished
.
``
Indeed
,
my
lord
,
''
says
*NL*
she
,
``
the
girl
hath
had
a
foolish
education
,
neither
adapted
to
her
*NL*
fortune
nor
her
family

Her
father

I
am
sorry
to
say
it
,
is
to
blame
*NL*
for
everything
.
The
girl
hath
silly
country
notions
of
bashfulness
.
*NL*
Nothing
else
,
my
lord
,
upon
my
honour
;
I
am
convinced
she
hath
a
good
*NL*
understanding
at
the
bottom
,
and
will
be
brought
to
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
speech
was
made
in
the
absence
of
Sophia
;
for
she
had
some
*NL*
time
before
left
the
room
,
with
more
appearance
of
passion
than
she
*NL*
had
ever
shown
on
any
occasion
;
and
now
his
lordship
,
after
many
*NL*
expressions
of
thanks
to
Mrs
Western
,
many
ardent
professions
of
*NL*
passion
which
nothing
could
conquer
,
and
many
assurances
of
*NL*
perseverance
,
which
Mrs
Western
highly
encouraged
,
took
his
leave
for
*NL*
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
we
relate
what
now
passed
between
Mrs
Western
and
Sophia
,
it
*NL*
may
be
proper
to
mention
an
unfortunate
accident
which
had
happened
,
*NL*
and
which
had
occasioned
the
return
of
Mrs
Western
with
so
much
fury
,
*NL*
as
we
have
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
then
must
know
that
the
maid
who
at
present
attended
on
*NL*
Sophia
was
recommended
by
Lady
Bellaston
,
with
whom
she
had
lived
for
*NL*
some
time
in
the
capacity
of
a
comb-brush
:
she
was
a
very
sensible
*NL*
girl
,
and
had
received
the
strictest
instructions
to
watch
her
young
*NL*
lady
very
carefully
.
These
instructions
,
we
are
sorry
to
say
,
were
*NL*
communicated
to
her
by
Mrs
Honour
,
into
whose
favour
Lady
Bellaston
*NL*
had
now
so
ingratiated
herself
,
that
the
violent
affection
which
the
*NL*
good
waiting-woman
had
formerly
borne
to
Sophia
was
entirely
*NL*
obliterated
by
that
great
attachment
which
she
had
to
her
new
*NL*
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
when
Mrs
Miller
was
departed
,
Betty
-LRB-
for
that
was
the
name
of
the
*NL*
girl
-RRB-
,
returning
to
her
young
lady
,
found
her
very
attentively
engaged
*NL*
in
reading
a
long
letter
,
and
the
visible
emotions
which
she
betrayed
*NL*
on
that
occasion
might
have
well
accounted
for
some
suspicions
which
*NL*
the
girl
entertained
;
but
indeed
they
had
yet
a
stronger
foundation
,
*NL*
for
she
had
overheard
the
whole
scene
which
passed
between
Sophia
and
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
was
acquainted
with
all
this
matter
by
Betty
,
who
,
after
*NL*
receiving
many
commendations
and
some
rewards
for
her
fidelity
,
was
*NL*
ordered
,
that
,
if
the
woman
who
brought
the
letter
came
again
,
she
*NL*
should
introduce
her
to
Mrs
Western
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unluckily
,
Mrs
Miller
returned
at
the
very
time
when
Sophia
was
*NL*
engaged
with
his
lordship
.
Betty
,
according
to
order
,
sent
her
*NL*
directly
to
the
aunt
;
who
,
being
mistress
of
so
many
circumstances
*NL*
relating
to
what
had
past
the
day
before
,
easily
imposed
upon
the
poor
*NL*
woman
to
believe
that
Sophia
had
communicated
the
whole
affair
;
and
so
*NL*
pumped
everything
out
of
her
which
she
knew
relating
to
the
letter
and
*NL*
relating
to
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
poor
creature
might
,
indeed
,
be
called
simplicity
itself
.
She
was
*NL*
one
of
that
order
of
mortals
who
are
apt
to
believe
everything
which
*NL*
is
said
to
them
;
to
whom
nature
hath
neither
indulged
the
offensive
*NL*
nor
defensive
weapons
of
deceit
,
and
who
are
consequently
liable
to
be
*NL*
imposed
upon
by
any
one
who
will
only
be
at
the
expense
of
a
little
*NL*
falshood
for
that
purpose
.
Mrs
Western
,
having
drained
Mrs
Miller
of
*NL*
all
she
knew
,
which
,
indeed
,
was
but
little
,
but
which
was
sufficient
*NL*
to
make
the
aunt
suspect
a
great
deal
,
dismissed
her
with
assurances
*NL*
that
Sophia
would
not
see
her
,
that
she
would
send
no
answer
to
the
*NL*
letter
,
nor
ever
receive
another
;
nor
did
she
suffer
her
to
depart
*NL*
without
a
handsome
lecture
on
the
merits
of
an
office
to
which
she
*NL*
could
afford
no
better
name
than
that
of
procuress
.
--
This
discovery
*NL*
had
greatly
discomposed
her
temper
,
when
,
coming
into
the
apartment
*NL*
next
to
that
in
which
the
lovers
were
,
she
overheard
Sophia
very
*NL*
warmly
protesting
against
his
lordship
's
addresses
.
At
which
the
rage
*NL*
already
kindled
burst
forth
,
and
she
rushed
in
upon
her
niece
in
a
*NL*
most
furious
manner
,
as
we
have
already
described
,
together
with
what
*NL*
past
at
that
time
till
his
lordship
's
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
was
Lord
Fellamar
gone
than
Mrs
Western
returned
to
Sophia
,
*NL*
whom
she
upbraided
in
the
most
bitter
terms
for
the
ill
use
she
had
*NL*
made
of
the
confidence
reposed
in
her
;
and
for
her
treachery
in
*NL*
conversing
with
a
man
with
whom
she
had
offered
but
the
day
before
to
*NL*
bind
herself
in
the
most
solemn
oath
never
more
to
have
any
*NL*
conversation
.
Sophia
protested
she
had
maintained
no
such
*NL*
conversation
.
``
How
,
how
!
Miss
Western
,
''
said
the
aunt
;
``
will
you
deny
*NL*
your
receiving
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
?
''
``
A
letter
,
madam
!
''
*NL*
answered
Sophia
,
somewhat
surprized
.
``
It
is
not
very
well
bred
,
miss
,
''
*NL*
replies
the
aunt
,
``
to
repeat
my
words
.
I
say
a
letter
,
and
I
insist
*NL*
upon
your
showing
it
me
immediately
.
''
``
I
scorn
a
lie
,
madam
,
''
said
*NL*
Sophia
;
``
I
did
receive
a
letter
,
but
it
was
without
my
desire
,
and
,
*NL*
indeed
,
I
may
say
,
against
my
consent
.
''
``
Indeed
,
indeed
,
miss
,
''
cries
*NL*
the
aunt
,
``
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
owning
you
had
received
it
at
*NL*
all
;
but
where
is
the
letter
?
for
I
will
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
peremptory
demand
,
Sophia
paused
some
time
before
she
returned
*NL*
an
answer
;
and
at
last
only
excused
herself
by
declaring
she
had
not
*NL*
the
letter
in
her
pocket
,
which
was
,
indeed
,
true
;
upon
which
her
*NL*
aunt
,
losing
all
manner
of
patience
,
asked
her
niece
this
short
*NL*
question
,
whether
she
would
resolve
to
marry
Lord
Fellamar
,
or
no
?
to
*NL*
which
she
received
the
strongest
negative
.
Mrs
Western
then
replied
*NL*
with
an
oath
,
or
something
very
like
one
,
that
she
would
early
the
*NL*
next
morning
deliver
her
back
into
her
father
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
then
began
to
reason
with
her
aunt
in
the
following
*NL*
manner
:
--
``
Why
,
madam
,
must
I
of
necessity
be
forced
to
marry
at
all
?
*NL*
Consider
how
cruel
you
would
have
thought
it
in
your
own
case
,
and
how
*NL*
much
kinder
your
parents
were
in
leaving
you
to
your
liberty
.
What
*NL*
have
I
done
to
forfeit
this
liberty
?
I
will
never
marry
contrary
to
my
*NL*
father
's
consent
,
nor
without
asking
yours
--
And
when
I
ask
the
*NL*
consent
of
either
improperly
,
it
will
be
then
time
enough
to
force
*NL*
some
other
marriage
upon
me
.
''
``
Can
I
bear
to
hear
this
,
''
cries
Mrs
*NL*
Western
,
``
from
a
girl
who
hath
now
a
letter
from
a
murderer
in
her
*NL*
pocket
?
''
``
I
have
no
such
letter
,
I
promise
you
,
''
answered
Sophia
;
*NL*
``
and
,
if
he
be
a
murderer
,
he
will
soon
be
in
no
condition
to
give
you
*NL*
any
further
disturbance
.
''
``
How
,
Miss
Western
!
''
said
the
aunt
,
``
have
*NL*
you
the
assurance
to
speak
of
him
in
this
manner
;
to
own
your
*NL*
affection
for
such
a
villain
to
my
face
?
''
``
Sure
,
madam
,
''
said
Sophia
,
*NL*
``
you
put
a
very
strange
construction
on
my
words
.
''
``
Indeed
,
Miss
*NL*
Western
,
''
cries
the
lady
,
``
I
shall
not
bear
this
usage
;
you
have
*NL*
learnt
of
your
father
this
manner
of
treating
me
;
he
hath
taught
you
*NL*
to
give
me
the
lie
.
He
hath
totally
ruined
you
by
this
false
system
of
*NL*
education
;
and
,
please
heaven
,
he
shall
have
the
comfort
of
its
*NL*
fruits
;
for
once
more
I
declare
to
you
,
that
to-morrow
morning
I
will
*NL*
carry
you
back
.
I
will
withdraw
all
my
forces
from
the
field
,
and
*NL*
remain
henceforth
,
like
the
wise
king
of
Prussia
,
in
a
state
of
*NL*
perfect
neutrality
.
You
are
both
too
wise
to
be
regulated
by
my
*NL*
measures
;
so
prepare
yourself
,
for
to-morrow
morning
you
shall
*NL*
evacuate
this
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
remonstrated
all
she
could
;
but
her
aunt
was
deaf
to
all
she
*NL*
said
.
In
this
resolution
therefore
we
must
at
present
leave
her
,
as
*NL*
there
seems
to
be
no
hopes
of
bringing
her
to
change
it

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
What
happened
to
Mr
Jones
in
the
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
passed
about
twenty-four
melancholy
hours
by
himself
,
unless
*NL*
when
relieved
by
the
company
of
Partridge
,
before
Mr
Nightingale
*NL*
returned
;
not
that
this
worthy
young
man
had
deserted
or
forgot
his
*NL*
friend
;
for
,
indeed
,
he
had
been
much
the
greatest
part
of
the
time
*NL*
employed
in
his
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
heard
,
upon
enquiry
,
that
the
only
persons
who
had
seen
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
unfortunate
rencounter
were
a
crew
belonging
to
a
*NL*
man-of-war
which
then
lay
at
Deptford
.
To
Deptford
therefore
he
went
*NL*
in
search
of
this
crew
,
where
he
was
informed
that
the
men
he
sought
*NL*
after
were
all
gone
ashore
.
He
then
traced
them
from
place
to
place
,
*NL*
till
at
last
he
found
two
of
them
drinking
together
,
with
a
third
*NL*
person
,
at
a
hedge-tavern
near
Aldersgate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nightingale
desired
to
speak
with
Jones
by
himself
-LRB-
for
Partridge
was
*NL*
in
the
room
when
he
came
in
-RRB-
.
As
soon
as
they
were
alone
,
Nightingale
,
*NL*
taking
Jones
by
the
hand
,
cried
,
``
Come
,
my
brave
friend
,
be
not
too
*NL*
much
dejected
at
what
I
am
going
to
tell
you
--
I
am
sorry
I
am
the
*NL*
messenger
of
bad
news
;
but
I
think
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
.
''
``
I
guess
*NL*
already
what
that
bad
news
is
,
''
cries
Jones
.
``
The
poor
gentleman
then
*NL*
is
dead
.
''
--
``
I
hope
not
,
''
answered
Nightingale
.
``
He
was
alive
this
*NL*
morning
;
though
I
will
not
flatter
you
;
I
fear
,
from
the
accounts
I
*NL*
could
get
,
that
his
wound
is
mortal
.
But
if
the
affair
be
exactly
as
*NL*
you
told
it
,
your
own
remorse
would
be
all
you
would
have
reason
to
*NL*
apprehend
,
let
what
would
happen
;
but
forgive
me
,
my
dear
Tom
,
if
I
*NL*
entreat
you
to
make
the
worst
of
your
story
to
your
friends

If
you
*NL*
disguise
anything
to
us
,
you
will
only
be
an
enemy
to
yourself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
reason
,
my
dear
Jack
,
have
I
ever
given
you
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
to
*NL*
stab
me
with
so
cruel
a
suspicion
?
''
``
Have
patience
,
''
cries
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
and
I
will
tell
you
all
.
After
the
most
diligent
enquiry
*NL*
I
could
make
,
I
at
last
met
with
two
of
the
fellows
who
were
present
*NL*
at
this
unhappy
accident
,
and
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
they
do
not
relate
*NL*
the
story
so
much
in
your
favour
as
you
yourself
have
told
it
.
''
``
Why
,
*NL*
what
do
they
say
?
''
cries
Jones
.
``
Indeed
what
I
am
sorry
to
repeat
,
as
*NL*
I
am
afraid
of
the
consequence
of
it
to
you
.
They
say
that
they
were
*NL*
at
too
great
a
distance
to
overhear
any
words
that
passed
between
you
:
*NL*
but
they
both
agree
that
the
first
blow
was
given
by
you
.
''
``
Then
,
upon
*NL*
my
soul
,
''
answered
Jones
,
``
they
injure
me
.
He
not
only
struck
me
*NL*
first
,
but
struck
me
without
the
least
provocation
.
What
should
induce
*NL*
those
villains
to
accuse
me
falsely
?
''
``
Nay
,
that
I
can
not
guess
,
''
said
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
and
if
you
yourself
,
and
I
,
who
am
so
heartily
your
*NL*
friend
,
can
not
conceive
a
reason
why
they
should
belie
you
,
what
*NL*
reason
will
an
indifferent
court
of
justice
be
able
to
assign
why
they
*NL*
should
not
believe
them
?
I
repeated
the
question
to
them
several
*NL*
times
,
and
so
did
another
gentleman
who
was
present
,
who
,
I
believe
,
*NL*
is
a
seafaring
man
,
and
who
really
acted
a
very
friendly
part
by
you
;
*NL*
for
he
begged
them
often
to
consider
that
there
was
the
life
of
a
man
*NL*
in
the
case
;
and
asked
them
over
and
over
,
if
they
were
certain
;
to
*NL*
which
they
both
answered
,
that
they
were
,
and
would
abide
by
their
*NL*
evidence
upon
oath
.
For
heaven
's
sake
,
my
dear
friend
,
recollect
*NL*
yourself
;
for
,
if
this
should
appear
to
be
the
fact
,
it
will
be
your
*NL*
business
to
think
in
time
of
making
the
best
of
your
interest
.
I
would
*NL*
not
shock
you
;
but
you
know
,
I
believe
,
the
severity
of
the
law
,
*NL*
whatever
verbal
provocations
may
have
been
given
you
.
''
``
Alas
!
my
*NL*
friend
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
what
interest
hath
such
a
wretch
as
I
?
Besides
,
*NL*
do
you
think
I
would
even
wish
to
live
with
the
reputation
of
a
*NL*
murderer
?
If
I
had
any
friends
-LRB-
as
,
alas
!
I
have
none
-RRB-
,
could
I
have
*NL*
the
confidence
to
solicit
them
to
speak
in
the
behalf
of
a
man
*NL*
condemned
for
the
blackest
crime
in
human
nature
?
Believe
me
,
I
have
*NL*
no
such
hope
;
but
I
have
some
reliance
on
a
throne
still
greatly
*NL*
superior
;
which
will
,
I
am
certain
,
afford
me
all
the
protection
I
*NL*
merit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
concluded
with
many
solemn
and
vehement
protestations
of
the
*NL*
truth
of
what
he
had
at
first
asserted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
faith
of
Nightingale
was
now
again
staggered
,
and
began
to
incline
*NL*
to
credit
his
friend
,
when
Mrs
Miller
appeared
,
and
made
a
sorrowful
*NL*
report
of
the
success
of
her
embassy
;
which
when
Jones
had
heard
,
he
*NL*
cried
out
most
heroically
,
``
Well
,
my
friend
,
I
am
now
indifferent
as
*NL*
to
what
shall
happen
,
at
least
with
regard
to
my
life
;
and
if
it
be
*NL*
the
will
of
Heaven
that
I
shall
make
an
atonement
with
that
for
the
*NL*
blood
I
have
spilt
,
I
hope
the
Divine
Goodness
will
one
day
suffer
my
*NL*
honour
to
be
cleared
,
and
that
the
words
of
a
dying
man
,
at
least
,
*NL*
will
be
believed
,
so
far
as
to
justify
his
character
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
mournful
scene
now
past
between
the
prisoner
and
his
friends
,
*NL*
at
which
,
as
few
readers
would
have
been
pleased
to
be
present
,
so
*NL*
few
,
I
believe
,
will
desire
to
hear
it
particularly
related
.
We
will
,
*NL*
therefore
,
pass
on
to
the
entrance
of
the
turnkey
,
who
acquainted
*NL*
Jones
that
there
was
a
lady
without
who
desired
to
speak
with
him
when
*NL*
he
was
at
leisure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
declared
his
surprize
at
this
message
.
He
said
,
``
He
knew
no
lady
*NL*
in
the
world
whom
he
could
possibly
expect
to
see
there
.
''
However
,
as
*NL*
he
saw
no
reason
to
decline
seeing
any
person
,
Mrs
Miller
and
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
presently
took
their
leave
,
and
he
gave
orders
to
have
the
*NL*
lady
admitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Jones
was
surprized
at
the
news
of
a
visit
from
a
lady
,
how
greatly
*NL*
was
he
astonished
when
he
discovered
this
lady
to
be
no
other
than
Mrs
*NL*
Waters
!
In
this
astonishment
then
we
shall
leave
him
awhile
,
in
order
*NL*
to
cure
the
surprize
of
the
reader
,
who
will
likewise
,
probably
,
not
a
*NL*
little
wonder
at
the
arrival
of
this
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
this
Mrs
Waters
was
,
the
reader
pretty
well
knows
;
what
she
was
,
*NL*
he
must
be
perfectly
satisfied
.
He
will
therefore
be
pleased
to
*NL*
remember
that
this
lady
departed
from
Upton
in
the
same
coach
with
Mr
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
and
the
other
Irish
gentleman
,
and
in
their
company
*NL*
travelled
to
Bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
there
was
a
certain
office
in
the
gift
of
Mr
Fitzpatrick
at
that
*NL*
time
vacant
,
namely
that
of
a
wife
:
for
the
lady
who
had
lately
filled
*NL*
that
office
had
resigned
,
or
at
least
deserted
her
duty
.
Mr
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
therefore
,
having
thoroughly
examined
Mrs
Waters
on
the
*NL*
road
,
found
her
extremely
fit
for
the
place
,
which
,
on
their
arrival
*NL*
at
Bath
,
he
presently
conferred
upon
her
,
and
she
without
any
scruple
*NL*
accepted
.
As
husband
and
wife
this
gentleman
and
lady
continued
*NL*
together
all
the
time
they
stayed
at
Bath
,
and
as
husband
and
wife
*NL*
they
arrived
together
in
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
Mr
Fitzpatrick
was
so
wise
a
man
as
not
to
part
with
one
good
*NL*
thing
till
he
had
secured
another
,
which
he
had
at
present
only
a
*NL*
prospect
of
regaining
;
or
whether
Mrs
Waters
had
so
well
discharged
*NL*
her
office
,
that
he
intended
still
to
retain
her
as
principal
,
and
to
*NL*
make
his
wife
-LRB-
as
is
often
the
case
-RRB-
only
her
deputy
,
I
will
not
say
;
*NL*
but
certain
it
is
,
he
never
mentioned
his
wife
to
her
,
never
*NL*
communicated
to
her
the
letter
given
him
by
Mrs
Western
,
nor
ever
once
*NL*
hinted
his
purpose
of
repossessing
his
wife
;
much
less
did
he
ever
*NL*
mention
the
name
of
Jones
.
For
,
though
he
intended
to
fight
with
him
*NL*
wherever
he
met
him
,
he
did
not
imitate
those
prudent
persons
who
*NL*
think
a
wife
,
a
mother
,
a
sister
,
or
sometimes
a
whole
family
,
the
*NL*
safest
seconds
on
these
occasions
.
The
first
account
therefore
which
*NL*
she
had
of
all
this
was
delivered
to
her
from
his
lips
,
after
he
was
*NL*
brought
home
from
the
tavern
where
his
wound
had
been
drest
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mr
Fitzpatrick
,
however
,
had
not
the
clearest
way
of
telling
a
*NL*
story
at
any
time
,
and
was
now
,
perhaps
,
a
little
more
confused
than
*NL*
usual
,
it
was
some
time
before
she
discovered
that
the
gentleman
who
*NL*
had
given
him
this
wound
was
the
very
same
person
from
whom
her
heart
*NL*
had
received
a
wound
,
which
,
though
not
of
a
mortal
kind
,
was
yet
so
*NL*
deep
that
it
had
left
a
considerable
scar
behind
it
.
But
no
sooner
was
*NL*
she
acquainted
that
Mr
Jones
himself
was
the
man
who
had
been
*NL*
committed
to
the
Gatehouse
for
this
supposed
murder
,
than
she
took
the
*NL*
first
opportunity
of
committing
Mr
Fitzpatrick
to
the
care
of
his
*NL*
nurse
,
and
hastened
away
to
visit
the
conqueror
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
entered
the
room
with
an
air
of
gaiety
,
which
received
an
*NL*
immediate
check
from
the
melancholy
aspect
of
poor
Jones
,
who
started
*NL*
and
blessed
himself
when
he
saw
her
.
Upon
which
she
said
,
``
Nay
,
I
do
*NL*
not
wonder
at
your
surprize
;
I
believe
you
did
not
expect
to
see
me
;
*NL*
for
few
gentlemen
are
troubled
here
with
visits
from
any
lady
,
unless
*NL*
a
wife
.
You
see
the
power
you
have
over
me
,
Mr
Jones
.
Indeed
,
I
little
*NL*
thought
,
when
we
parted
at
Upton
,
that
our
next
meeting
would
have
*NL*
been
in
such
a
place
.
''
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
says
Jones
,
``
I
must
look
upon
*NL*
this
visit
as
kind
;
few
will
follow
the
miserable
,
especially
to
such
*NL*
dismal
habitations
.
''
``
I
protest
,
Mr
Jones
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
can
hardly
*NL*
persuade
myself
you
are
the
same
agreeable
fellow
I
saw
at
Upton
.
Why
,
*NL*
your
face
is
more
miserable
than
any
dungeon
in
the
universe
.
What
can
*NL*
be
the
matter
with
you
?
''
``
I
thought
,
madam
,
''
said
Jones
,
``
as
you
knew
*NL*
of
my
being
here
,
you
knew
the
unhappy
reason
.
''
``
Pugh
!
''
says
she
,
``
you
*NL*
have
pinked
a
man
in
a
duel
,
that
's
all
.
''
Jones
exprest
some
*NL*
indignation
at
this
levity
,
and
spoke
with
the
utmost
contrition
for
*NL*
what
had
happened
.
To
which
she
answered
,
``
Well
,
then
,
sir
,
if
you
*NL*
take
it
so
much
to
heart
,
I
will
relieve
you
;
the
gentleman
is
not
*NL*
dead
,
and
,
I
am
pretty
confident
,
is
in
no
danger
of
dying
.
The
*NL*
surgeon
,
indeed
,
who
first
dressed
him
was
a
young
fellow
,
and
seemed
*NL*
desirous
of
representing
his
case
to
be
as
bad
as
possible
,
that
he
*NL*
might
have
the
more
honour
from
curing
him
:
but
the
king
's
surgeon
*NL*
hath
seen
him
since
,
and
says
,
unless
from
a
fever
,
of
which
there
are
*NL*
at
present
no
symptoms
,
he
apprehends
not
the
least
danger
of
life
.
''
*NL*
Jones
shewed
great
satisfaction
in
his
countenance
at
this
report
;
*NL*
upon
which
she
affirmed
the
truth
of
it
,
adding
,
``
By
the
most
*NL*
extraordinary
accident
in
the
world
I
lodge
at
the
same
house
;
and
*NL*
have
seen
the
gentleman
,
and
I
promise
you
he
doth
you
justice
,
and
*NL*
says
,
whatever
be
the
consequence
,
that
he
was
entirely
the
aggressor
,
*NL*
and
that
you
was
not
in
the
least
to
blame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
expressed
the
utmost
satisfaction
at
the
account
which
Mrs
*NL*
Waters
brought
him
.
He
then
informed
her
of
many
things
which
she
well
*NL*
knew
before
,
as
who
Mr
Fitzpatrick
was
,
the
occasion
of
his
*NL*
resentment
,
&
c
.
He
likewise
told
her
several
facts
of
which
she
was
*NL*
ignorant
,
as
the
adventure
of
the
muff
,
and
other
particulars
,
*NL*
concealing
only
the
name
of
Sophia
.
He
then
lamented
the
follies
and
*NL*
vices
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
;
every
one
of
which
,
he
said
,
had
*NL*
been
attended
with
such
ill
consequences
,
that
he
should
be
*NL*
unpardonable
if
he
did
not
take
warning
,
and
quit
those
vicious
*NL*
courses
for
the
future
.
He
lastly
concluded
with
assuring
her
of
his
*NL*
resolution
to
sin
no
more
,
lest
a
worse
thing
should
happen
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
with
great
pleasantry
ridiculed
all
this
,
as
the
effects
of
*NL*
low
spirits
and
confinement
.
She
repeated
some
witticisms
about
the
*NL*
devil
when
he
was
sick
,
and
told
him
,
``
She
doubted
not
but
shortly
to
*NL*
see
him
at
liberty
,
and
as
lively
a
fellow
as
ever
;
and
then
,
''
says
*NL*
she
,
``
I
do
n't
question
but
your
conscience
will
be
safely
delivered
of
*NL*
all
these
qualms
that
it
is
now
so
sick
in
breeding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Many
more
things
of
this
kind
she
uttered
,
some
of
which
it
would
do
*NL*
her
no
great
honour
,
in
the
opinion
of
some
readers
,
to
remember
;
nor
*NL*
are
we
quite
certain
but
that
the
answers
made
by
Jones
would
be
*NL*
treated
with
ridicule
by
others
.
We
shall
therefore
suppress
the
rest
*NL*
of
this
conversation
,
and
only
observe
that
it
ended
at
last
with
*NL*
perfect
innocence
,
and
much
more
to
the
satisfaction
of
Jones
than
of
*NL*
the
lady
;
for
the
former
was
greatly
transported
with
the
news
she
had
*NL*
brought
him
;
but
the
latter
was
not
altogether
so
pleased
with
the
*NL*
penitential
behaviour
of
a
man
whom
she
had
,
at
her
first
interview
,
*NL*
conceived
a
very
different
opinion
of
from
what
she
now
entertained
of
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
melancholy
occasioned
by
the
report
of
Mr
Nightingale
was
*NL*
pretty
well
effaced
;
but
the
dejection
into
which
Mrs
Miller
had
*NL*
thrown
him
still
continued
.
The
account
she
gave
so
well
tallied
with
*NL*
the
words
of
Sophia
herself
in
her
letter
,
that
he
made
not
the
least
*NL*
doubt
but
that
she
had
disclosed
his
letter
to
her
aunt
,
and
had
taken
*NL*
a
fixed
resolution
to
abandon
him
.
The
torments
this
thought
gave
him
*NL*
were
to
be
equalled
only
by
a
piece
of
news
which
fortune
had
yet
in
*NL*
store
for
him
,
and
which
we
shall
communicate
in
the
second
chapter
of
*NL*
the
ensuing
book
.

CONTAINING

SIX

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
i

*NL*
*NL*
A
farewel
to
the
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
now
,
reader
,
arrived
at
the
last
stage
of
our
long
journey
.
As
*NL*
we
have
,
therefore
,
travelled
together
through
so
many
pages
,
let
us
*NL*
behave
to
one
another
like
fellow-travellers
in
a
stage
coach
,
who
*NL*
have
passed
several
days
in
the
company
of
each
other
;
and
who
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
any
bickerings
or
little
animosities
which
may
have
*NL*
occurred
on
the
road
,
generally
make
all
up
at
last
,
and
mount
,
for
*NL*
the
last
time
,
into
their
vehicle
with
chearfulness
and
good
humour
;
*NL*
since
after
this
one
stage
,
it
may
possibly
happen
to
us
,
as
it
*NL*
commonly
happens
to
them
,
never
to
meet
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
have
here
taken
up
this
simile
,
give
me
leave
to
carry
it
a
*NL*
little
farther
.
I
intend
,
then
,
in
this
last
book
,
to
imitate
the
good
*NL*
company
I
have
mentioned
in
their
last
journey
.
Now
,
it
is
well
known
*NL*
that
all
jokes
and
raillery
are
at
this
time
laid
aside
;
whatever
*NL*
characters
any
of
the
passengers
have
for
the
jest-sake
personated
on
*NL*
the
road
are
now
thrown
off
,
and
the
conversation
is
usually
plain
and
*NL*
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
manner
,
if
I
have
now
and
then
,
in
the
course
of
this
*NL*
work
,
indulged
any
pleasantry
for
thy
entertainment
,
I
shall
here
lay
*NL*
it
down
.
The
variety
of
matter
,
indeed
,
which
I
shall
be
obliged
to
*NL*
cram
into
this
book
,
will
afford
no
room
for
any
of
those
ludicrous
*NL*
observations
which
I
have
elsewhere
made
,
and
which
may
sometimes
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
have
prevented
thee
from
taking
a
nap
when
it
was
beginning
*NL*
to
steal
upon
thee
.
In
this
last
book
thou
wilt
find
nothing
-LRB-
or
at
*NL*
most
very
little
-RRB-
of
that
nature
.
All
will
be
plain
narrative
only
;
*NL*
and
,
indeed
,
when
thou
hast
perused
the
many
great
events
which
this
*NL*
book
will
produce
,
thou
wilt
think
the
number
of
pages
contained
in
it
*NL*
scarce
sufficient
to
tell
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
,
my
friend
,
I
take
this
opportunity
-LRB-
as
I
shall
have
no
other
-RRB-
*NL*
of
heartily
wishing
thee
well
.
If
I
have
been
an
entertaining
*NL*
companion
to
thee
,
I
promise
thee
it
is
what
I
have
desired
.
If
in
*NL*
anything
I
have
offended
,
it
was
really
without
any
intention
.
Some
*NL*
things
,
perhaps
,
here
said
,
may
have
hit
thee
or
thy
friends
;
but
I
do
*NL*
most
solemnly
declare
they
were
not
pointed
at
thee
or
them
.
I
*NL*
question
not
but
thou
hast
been
told
,
among
other
stories
of
me
,
that
*NL*
thou
wast
to
travel
with
a
very
scurrilous
fellow
;
but
whoever
told
*NL*
thee
so
did
me
an
injury
.
No
man
detests
and
despises
scurrility
more
*NL*
than
myself
;
nor
hath
any
man
more
reason
;
for
none
hath
ever
been
*NL*
treated
with
more
;
and
what
is
a
very
severe
fate
,
I
have
had
some
of
*NL*
the
abusive
writings
of
those
very
men
fathered
upon
me
,
who
,
in
other
*NL*
of
their
works
,
have
abused
me
themselves
with
the
utmost
virulence
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
works
,
however
,
I
am
well
convinced
,
will
be
dead
long
*NL*
before
this
page
shall
offer
itself
to
thy
perusal
;
for
however
short
*NL*
the
period
may
be
of
my
own
performances
,
they
will
most
probably
*NL*
outlive
their
own
infirm
author

and
the
weakly
productions
of
his
*NL*
abusive
contemporaries

Chapter
ii
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
a
very
tragical
incident
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
Jones
was
employed
in
those
unpleasant
meditations
,
with
which
*NL*
we
left
him
tormenting
himself
,
Partridge
came
stumbling
into
the
room
*NL*
with
his
face
paler
than
ashes
,
his
eyes
fixed
in
his
head
,
his
hair
*NL*
standing
an
end
,
and
every
limb
trembling
.
In
short
,
he
looked
as
*NL*
he
would
have
done
had
he
seen
a
spectre
,
or
had
he
,
indeed
,
been
a
*NL*
spectre
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
who
was
little
subject
to
fear
,
could
not
avoid
being
somewhat
*NL*
shocked
at
this
sudden
appearance
.
He
did
,
indeed
,
himself
change
*NL*
colour
,
and
his
voice
a
little
faultered
while
he
asked
him
,
What
was
*NL*
the
matter
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
,
sir
,
''
said
Partridge
,
``
you
will
not
be
angry
with
me
.
Indeed
*NL*
I
did
not
listen
,
but
I
was
obliged
to
stay
in
the
outward
room
.
I
am
*NL*
sure
I
wish
I
had
been
a
hundred
miles
off
,
rather
than
have
heard
*NL*
what
I
have
heard
.
''
``
Why
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
said
Jones
.
``
The
*NL*
matter
,
sir
?
O
good
Heaven
!
''
answered
Partridge
,
``
was
that
woman
who
*NL*
is
just
gone
out
the
woman
who
was
with
you
at
Upton
?
''
``
She
was
,
*NL*
Partridge
,
''
cried
Jones
.
``
And
did
you
really
,
sir
,
go
to
bed
with
that
*NL*
woman
?
''
said
he
,
trembling
.
--
``
I
am
afraid
what
past
between
us
is
no
*NL*
secret
,
''
said
Jones
.
--
``
Nay
,
but
pray
,
sir
,
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
*NL*
answer
me
,
''
cries
Partridge
.
``
You
know
I
did
,
''
cries
Jones
.
``
Why
then
,
*NL*
the
Lord
have
mercy
upon
your
soul
,
and
forgive
you
,
''
cries
Partridge
;
*NL*
``
but
as
sure
as
I
stand
here
alive
,
you
have
been
a-bed
with
your
own
*NL*
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
these
words
Jones
became
in
a
moment
a
greater
picture
of
horror
*NL*
than
Partridge
himself
.
He
was
,
indeed
,
for
some
time
struck
dumb
with
*NL*
amazement
,
and
both
stood
staring
wildly
at
each
other
.
At
last
his
*NL*
words
found
way
,
and
in
an
interrupted
voice
he
said
,
``
How
!
how
!
*NL*
what
's
this
you
tell
me
?
''
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
cries
Partridge
,
``
I
have
not
*NL*
breath
enough
left
to
tell
you
now
,
but
what
I
have
said
is
most
*NL*
certainly
true
.
--
That
woman
who
now
went
out
is
your
own
mother
.
How
*NL*
unlucky
was
it
for
you
,
sir
,
that
I
did
not
happen
to
see
her
at
that
*NL*
time
,
to
have
prevented
it
!
Sure
the
devil
himself
must
have
contrived
*NL*
to
bring
about
this
wickedness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
cries
Jones
,
``
Fortune
will
never
have
done
with
me
till
she
*NL*
hath
driven
me
to
distraction
.
But
why
do
I
blame
Fortune
?
I
am
myself
*NL*
the
cause
of
all
my
misery
.
All
the
dreadful
mischiefs
which
have
*NL*
befallen
me
are
the
consequences
only
of
my
own
folly
and
vice
.
What
*NL*
thou
hast
told
me
,
Partridge
,
hath
almost
deprived
me
of
my
senses
!
*NL*
And
was
Mrs
Waters
,
then
--
but
why
do
I
ask
?
for
thou
must
certainly
*NL*
know
her
--
If
thou
hast
any
affection
for
me
,
nay
,
if
thou
hast
any
*NL*
pity
,
let
me
beseech
thee
to
fetch
this
miserable
woman
back
again
to
*NL*
me
.
O
good
Heavens
!
incest
--
with
a
mother
!
To
what
am
I
reserved
!
''
*NL*
He
then
fell
into
the
most
violent
and
frantic
agonies
of
grief
and
*NL*
despair
,
in
which
Partridge
declared
he
would
not
leave
him
;
but
at
*NL*
last
,
having
vented
the
first
torrent
of
passion
,
he
came
a
little
to
*NL*
himself
;
and
then
,
having
acquainted
Partridge
that
he
would
find
this
*NL*
wretched
woman
in
the
same
house
where
the
wounded
gentleman
was
*NL*
lodged
,
he
despatched
him
in
quest
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
reader
will
please
to
refresh
his
memory
,
by
turning
to
the
*NL*
scene
at
Upton
,
in
the
ninth
book
,
he
will
be
apt
to
admire
the
many
*NL*
strange
accidents
which
unfortunately
prevented
any
interview
between
*NL*
Partridge
and
Mrs
Waters
,
when
she
spent
a
whole
day
there
with
Mr
*NL*
Jones
.
Instances
of
this
kind
we
may
frequently
observe
in
life
,
where
*NL*
the
greatest
events
are
produced
by
a
nice
train
of
little
*NL*
circumstances
;
and
more
than
one
example
of
this
may
be
discovered
by
*NL*
the
accurate
eye
,
in
this
our
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
fruitless
search
of
two
or
three
hours
,
Partridge
returned
*NL*
back
to
his
master
,
without
having
seen
Mrs
Waters
.
Jones
,
who
was
in
*NL*
a
state
of
desperation
at
his
delay
,
was
almost
raving
mad
when
he
*NL*
brought
him
his
account
.
He
was
not
long
,
however
,
in
this
condition
*NL*
before
he
received
the
following
letter
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
SIR
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
I
left
you
I
have
seen
a
gentleman
,
from
whom
I
have
learned
*NL*
something
concerning
you
which
greatly
surprizes
and
affects
me
;
but
*NL*
as
I
have
not
at
present
leisure
to
communicate
a
matter
of
such
*NL*
high
importance
,
you
must
suspend
your
curiosity
till
our
next
*NL*
meeting
,
which
shall
be
the
first
moment
I
am
able
to
see
you
.
O
,
Mr
*NL*
Jones
,
little
did
I
think
,
when
I
past
that
happy
day
at
Upton
,
the
*NL*
reflection
upon
which
is
like
to
embitter
all
my
future
life
,
who
it
*NL*
was
to
whom
I
owed
such
perfect
happiness
.
Believe
me
to
be
ever
*NL*
sincerely
your
unfortunate
*NL*
*NL*
``
J.
WATERS
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
P.S.
I
would
have
you
comfort
yourself
as
much
as
possible
,
for
Mr
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
is
in
no
manner
of
danger
;
so
that
whatever
other
*NL*
grievous
crimes
you
may
have
to
repent
of
,
the
guilt
of
blood
is
not
*NL*
among
the
number
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
having
read
the
letter
,
let
it
drop
-LRB-
for
he
was
unable
to
hold
*NL*
it
,
and
indeed
had
scarce
the
use
of
any
one
of
his
faculties
-RRB-
.
*NL*
Partridge
took
it
up
,
and
having
received
consent
by
silence
,
read
it
*NL*
likewise
;
nor
had
it
upon
him
a
less
sensible
effect
.
The
pencil
,
and
*NL*
not
the
pen
,
should
describe
the
horrors
which
appeared
in
both
their
*NL*
countenances
.
While
they
both
remained
speechless
the
turnkey
entered
*NL*
the
room
,
and
,
without
taking
any
notice
of
what
sufficiently
*NL*
discovered
itself
in
the
faces
of
them
both
,
acquainted
Jones
that
a
*NL*
man
without
desired
to
speak
with
him
.
This
person
was
presently
*NL*
introduced
,
and
was
no
other
than
Black
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
sights
of
horror
were
not
so
usual
to
George
as
they
were
to
the
*NL*
turnkey
,
he
instantly
saw
the
great
disorder
which
appeared
in
the
*NL*
face
of
Jones
.
This
he
imputed
to
the
accident
that
had
happened
,
*NL*
which
was
reported
in
the
very
worst
light
in
Mr
Western
's
family
;
he
*NL*
concluded
,
therefore
,
that
the
gentleman
was
dead
,
and
that
Mr
Jones
*NL*
was
in
a
fair
way
of
coming
to
a
shameful
end
.
A
thought
which
gave
*NL*
him
much
uneasiness
;
for
George
was
of
a
compassionate
disposition
,
*NL*
and
notwithstanding
a
small
breach
of
friendship
which
he
had
been
*NL*
over-tempted
to
commit
,
was
,
in
the
main
,
not
insensible
of
the
*NL*
obligations
he
had
formerly
received
from
Mr
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
fellow
,
therefore
,
scarce
refrained
from
a
tear
at
the
*NL*
present
sight
.
He
told
Jones
he
was
heartily
sorry
for
his
*NL*
misfortunes
,
and
begged
him
to
consider
if
he
could
be
of
any
manner
*NL*
of
service
.
``
Perhaps
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
may
want
a
little
matter
of
*NL*
money
upon
this
occasion
;
if
you
do
,
sir
,
what
little
I
have
is
*NL*
heartily
at
your
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
shook
him
very
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
gave
him
many
thanks
*NL*
for
the
kind
offer
he
had
made
;
but
answered
,
``
He
had
not
the
least
*NL*
want
of
that
kind
.
''
Upon
which
George
began
to
press
his
services
more
*NL*
eagerly
than
before
.
Jones
again
thanked
him
,
with
assurances
that
he
*NL*
wanted
nothing
which
was
in
the
power
of
any
man
living
to
give
.
*NL*
``
Come
,
come
,
my
good
master
,
''
answered
George
,
``
do
not
take
the
matter
*NL*
so
much
to
heart
.
Things
may
end
better
than
you
imagine
;
to
be
sure
*NL*
you
a
n't
the
first
gentleman
who
hath
killed
a
man
,
and
yet
come
off
.
''
*NL*
``
You
are
wide
of
the
matter
,
George
,
''
said
Partridge
,
``
the
gentleman
*NL*
is
not
dead
,
nor
like
to
die
.
Do
n't
disturb
my
master
,
at
present
,
for
*NL*
he
is
troubled
about
a
matter
in
which
it
is
not
in
your
power
to
do
*NL*
him
any
good
.
''
``
You
do
n't
know
what
I
may
be
able
to
do
,
Mr
*NL*
Partridge
,
''
answered
George
;
``
if
his
concern
is
about
my
young
lady
,
I
*NL*
have
some
news
to
tell
my
master
.
''
``
What
do
you
say
,
Mr
George
?
''
cried
*NL*
Jones
.
``
Hath
anything
lately
happened
in
which
my
Sophia
is
concerned
?
*NL*
My
Sophia
!
how
dares
such
a
wretch
as
I
mention
her
so
profanely
.
''
``
I
*NL*
hope
she
will
be
yours
yet
,
''
answered
George
.
``
Why
yes
,
sir
,
I
have
*NL*
something
to
tell
you
about
her
.
Madam
Western
hath
just
brought
Madam
*NL*
Sophia
home
,
and
there
hath
been
a
terrible
to
do
.
I
could
not
*NL*
possibly
learn
the
very
right
of
it
;
but
my
master
he
hath
been
in
a
*NL*
vast
big
passion
,
and
so
was
Madam
Western
,
and
I
heard
her
say
,
as
*NL*
she
went
out
of
doors
into
her
chair
,
that
she
would
never
set
her
*NL*
foot
in
master
's
house
again
.
I
do
n't
know
what
's
the
matter
,
not
I
,
*NL*
but
everything
was
very
quiet
when
I
came
out
;
but
Robin
,
who
waited
*NL*
at
supper
,
said
he
had
never
seen
the
squire
for
a
long
while
in
such
*NL*
good
humour
with
young
madam
;
that
he
kissed
her
several
times
,
and
*NL*
swore
she
should
be
her
own
mistress
,
and
he
never
would
think
of
*NL*
confining
her
any
more
.
I
thought
this
news
would
please
you
,
and
so
I
*NL*
slipped
out
,
though
it
was
so
late
,
to
inform
you
of
it
.
''
Mr
Jones
*NL*
assured
George
that
it
did
greatly
please
him
;
for
though
he
should
*NL*
never
more
presume
to
lift
his
eyes
toward
that
incomparable
creature
,
*NL*
nothing
could
so
much
relieve
his
misery
as
the
satisfaction
he
should
*NL*
always
have
in
hearing
of
her
welfare
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
conversation
which
passed
at
the
visit
is
not
*NL*
important
enough
to
be
here
related
.
The
reader
will
,
therefore
,
*NL*
forgive
us
this
abrupt
breaking
off
,
and
be
pleased
to
hear
how
this
*NL*
great
good-will
of
the
squire
towards
his
daughter
was
brought
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
,
on
her
first
arrival
at
her
brother
's
lodging
,
began
to
*NL*
set
forth
the
great
honours
and
advantages
which
would
accrue
to
the
*NL*
family
by
the
match
with
Lord
Fellamar
,
which
her
niece
had
absolutely
*NL*
refused
;
in
which
refusal
,
when
the
squire
took
the
part
of
his
*NL*
daughter
,
she
fell
immediately
into
the
most
violent
passion
,
and
so
*NL*
irritated
and
provoked
the
squire
,
that
neither
his
patience
nor
his
*NL*
prudence
could
bear
it
any
longer
;
upon
which
there
ensued
between
*NL*
them
both
so
warm
a
bout
at
altercation
,
that
perhaps
the
regions
of
*NL*
Billingsgate
never
equalled
it
.
In
the
heat
of
this
scolding
Mrs
*NL*
Western
departed
,
and
had
consequently
no
leisure
to
acquaint
her
*NL*
brother
with
the
letter
which
Sophia
received
,
which
might
have
*NL*
possibly
produced
ill
effects
;
but
,
to
say
truth
,
I
believe
it
never
*NL*
once
occurred
to
her
memory
at
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs
Western
was
gone
,
Sophia
,
who
had
been
hitherto
silent
,
as
*NL*
well
indeed
from
necessity
as
inclination
,
began
to
return
the
*NL*
compliment
which
her
father
had
made
her
,
in
taking
her
part
against
*NL*
her
aunt
,
by
taking
his
likewise
against
the
lady
.
This
was
the
first
*NL*
time
of
her
so
doing
,
and
it
was
in
the
highest
degree
acceptable
to
*NL*
the
squire
.
Again
,
he
remembered
that
Mr
Allworthy
had
insisted
on
an
*NL*
entire
relinquishment
of
all
violent
means
;
and
,
indeed
,
as
he
made
no
*NL*
doubt
but
that
Jones
would
be
hanged
,
he
did
not
in
the
least
question
*NL*
succeeding
with
his
daughter
by
fair
means
;
he
now
,
therefore
,
once
*NL*
more
gave
a
loose
to
his
natural
fondness
for
her
,
which
had
such
an
*NL*
effect
on
the
dutiful
,
grateful
,
tender
,
and
affectionate
heart
of
*NL*
Sophia
,
that
had
her
honour
,
given
to

,
and
something
else
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
in
which
he
was
concerned
,
been
removed
,
I
much
doubt
whether
*NL*
she
would
not
have
sacrificed
herself
to
a
man
she
did
not
like
,
to
*NL*
have
obliged
her
father
.
She
promised
him
she
would
make
it
the
whole
*NL*
business
of
her
life
to
oblige
him
,
and
would
never
marry
any
man
*NL*
against
his
consent
;
which
brought
the
old
man
so
near
to
his
highest
*NL*
happiness
,
that
he
was
resolved
to
take
the
other
step
,
and
went
to
*NL*
bed
completely
drunk
.

*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
visits
old
Nightingale
;
with
a
strange
discovery
that
he
*NL*
made
on
that
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
after
these
things
had
happened
,
Mr
Allworthy
went
,
*NL*
according
to
his
promise
,
to
visit
old
Nightingale
,
with
whom
his
*NL*
authority
was
so
great
,
that
,
after
having
sat
with
him
three
hours
,
*NL*
he
at
last
prevailed
with
him
to
consent
to
see
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
an
accident
happened
of
a
very
extraordinary
kind
;
one
indeed
of
*NL*
those
strange
chances
whence
very
good
and
grave
men
have
concluded
*NL*
that
Providence
often
interposes
in
the
discovery
of
the
most
secret
*NL*
villany
,
in
order
to
caution
men
from
quitting
the
paths
of
honesty
,
*NL*
however
warily
they
tread
in
those
of
vice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
,
at
his
entrance
into
Mr
Nightingale
's
,
saw
Black
George
;
*NL*
he
took
no
notice
of
him
,
nor
did
Black
George
imagine
he
had
*NL*
perceived
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
when
their
conversation
on
the
principal
point
was
over
,
*NL*
Allworthy
asked
Nightingale
,
Whether
he
knew
one
George
Seagrim
,
and
*NL*
upon
what
business
he
came
to
his
house
?
``
Yes
,
''
answered
Nightingale
,
*NL*
``
I
know
him
very
well
,
and
a
most
extraordinary
fellow
he
is
,
who
,
in
*NL*
these
days
,
hath
been
able
to
hoard
up
L500
from
renting
a
very
small
*NL*
estate
of
L30
a
year
.
''
``
And
is
this
the
story
which
he
hath
told
you
?
''
*NL*
cries
Allworthy
.
``
Nay
,
it
is
true
,
I
promise
you
,
''
said
Nightingale
,
*NL*
``
for
I
have
the
money
now
in
my
own
hands
,
in
five
bank-bills
,
which
I
*NL*
am
to
lay
out
either
in
a
mortgage
,
or
in
some
purchase
in
the
north
*NL*
of
England
.
''
The
bank-bills
were
no
sooner
produced
at
Allworthy
's
*NL*
desire
than
he
blessed
himself
at
the
strangeness
of
the
discovery
.
He
*NL*
presently
told
Nightingale
that
these
bank-bills
were
formerly
his
,
*NL*
and
then
acquainted
him
with
the
whole
affair
.
As
there
are
no
men
who
*NL*
complain
more
of
the
frauds
of
business
than
highwaymen
,
gamesters
,
*NL*
and
other
thieves
of
that
kind
,
so
there
are
none
who
so
bitterly
*NL*
exclaim
against
the
frauds
of
gamesters
,
&
c.
,
as
usurers
,
brokers
,
and
*NL*
other
thieves
of
this
kind
;
whether
it
be
that
the
one
way
of
cheating
*NL*
is
a
discountenance
or
reflection
upon
the
other
,
or
that
money
,
which
*NL*
is
the
common
mistress
of
all
cheats
,
makes
them
regard
each
other
in
*NL*
the
light
of
rivals
;
but
Nightingale
no
sooner
heard
the
story
than
he
*NL*
exclaimed
against
the
fellow
in
terms
much
severer
than
the
justice
*NL*
and
honesty
of
Allworthy
had
bestowed
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
desired
Nightingale
to
retain
both
the
money
and
the
secret
*NL*
till
he
should
hear
farther
from
him
;
and
,
if
he
should
in
the
*NL*
meantime
see
the
fellow
,
that
he
would
not
take
the
least
notice
to
*NL*
him
of
the
discovery
which
he
had
made
.
He
then
returned
to
his
*NL*
lodgings
,
where
he
found
Mrs
Miller
in
a
very
dejected
condition
,
on
*NL*
account
of
the
information
she
had
received
from
her
son-in-law
.
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
,
with
great
chearfulness
,
told
her
that
he
had
much
good
*NL*
news
to
communicate
;
and
,
with
little
further
preface
,
acquainted
her
*NL*
that
he
had
brought
Mr
Nightingale
to
consent
to
see
his
son
,
and
did
*NL*
not
in
the
least
doubt
to
effect
a
perfect
reconciliation
between
*NL*
them
;
though
he
found
the
father
more
sowered
by
another
accident
of
*NL*
the
same
kind
which
had
happened
in
his
family
.
He
then
mentioned
the
*NL*
running
away
of
the
uncle
's
daughter
,
which
he
had
been
told
by
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
,
and
which
Mrs
Miller
and
her
son-in-law
did
not
yet
*NL*
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
may
suppose
Mrs
Miller
received
this
account
with
great
*NL*
thankfulness
,
and
no
less
pleasure
;
but
so
uncommon
was
her
friendship
*NL*
to
Jones
,
that
I
am
not
certain
whether
the
uneasiness
she
suffered
*NL*
for
his
sake
did
not
overbalance
her
satisfaction
at
hearing
a
piece
*NL*
of
news
tending
so
much
to
the
happiness
of
her
own
family
;
nor
*NL*
whether
even
this
very
news
,
as
it
reminded
her
of
the
obligations
she
*NL*
had
to
Jones
,
did
not
hurt
as
well
as
please
her
;
when
her
grateful
*NL*
heart
said
to
her
,
``
While
my
own
family
is
happy
,
how
miserable
is
the
*NL*
poor
creature
to
whose
generosity
we
owe
the
beginning
of
all
this
*NL*
happiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
,
having
left
her
a
little
while
to
chew
the
cud
-LRB-
if
I
may
*NL*
use
that
expression
-RRB-
on
these
first
tidings
,
told
her
he
had
still
*NL*
something
more
to
impart
,
which
he
believed
would
give
her
pleasure
.
*NL*
``
I
think
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
have
discovered
a
pretty
considerable
treasure
*NL*
belonging
to
the
young
gentleman
,
your
friend
;
but
perhaps
,
indeed
,
*NL*
his
present
situation
may
be
such
that
it
will
be
of
no
service
to
*NL*
him
.
''
The
latter
part
of
the
speech
gave
Mrs
Miller
to
understand
who
*NL*
was
meant
,
and
she
answered
with
a
sigh
,
``
I
hope
not
,
sir
.
''
``
I
hope
so
*NL*
too
,
''
cries
Allworthy
,
``
with
all
my
heart
;
but
my
nephew
told
me
this
*NL*
morning
he
had
heard
a
very
bad
account
of
the
affair
.
''
--
``
Good
*NL*
Heaven
!
sir
,
''
said
she
--
``
Well
,
I
must
not
speak
,
and
yet
it
is
*NL*
certainly
very
hard
to
be
obliged
to
hold
one
's
tongue
when
one
*NL*
hears
.
''
--
``
Madam
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
you
may
say
whatever
you
please
,
*NL*
you
know
me
too
well
to
think
I
have
a
prejudice
against
any
one
;
and
*NL*
as
for
that
young
man
,
I
assure
you
I
should
be
heartily
pleased
to
*NL*
find
he
could
acquit
himself
of
everything
,
and
particularly
of
this
*NL*
sad
affair
.
You
can
testify
the
affection
I
have
formerly
borne
him
.
*NL*
The
world
,
I
know
,
censured
me
for
loving
him
so
much
.
I
did
not
*NL*
withdraw
that
affection
from
him
without
thinking
I
had
the
justest
*NL*
cause
.
Believe
me
,
Mrs
Miller
,
I
should
be
glad
to
find
I
have
been
*NL*
mistaken
.
''
Mrs
Miller
was
going
eagerly
to
reply
,
when
a
servant
*NL*
acquainted
her
that
a
gentleman
without
desired
to
speak
with
her
*NL*
immediately
.
Allworthy
then
enquired
for
his
nephew
,
and
was
told
that
*NL*
he
had
been
for
some
time
in
his
room
with
the
gentleman
who
used
to
*NL*
come
to
him
,
and
whom
Mr
Allworthy
guessing
rightly
to
be
Mr
Dowling
,
*NL*
he
desired
presently
to
speak
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dowling
attended
,
Allworthy
put
the
case
of
the
bank-notes
to
*NL*
him
,
without
mentioning
any
name
,
and
asked
in
what
manner
such
a
*NL*
person
might
be
punished
.
To
which
Dowling
answered
,
``
He
thought
he
*NL*
might
be
indicted
on
the
Black
Act
;
but
said
,
as
it
was
a
matter
of
*NL*
some
nicety
,
it
would
be
proper
to
go
to
counsel
.
He
said
he
was
to
*NL*
attend
counsel
presently
upon
an
affair
of
Mr
Western
's
,
and
if
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
pleased
he
would
lay
the
case
before
them
.
''
This
was
agreed
*NL*
to
;
and
then
Mrs
Miller
,
opening
the
door
,
cried
,
``
I
ask
pardon
,
I
did
*NL*
not
know
you
had
company
;
''
but
Allworthy
desired
her
to
come
in
,
*NL*
saying
he
had
finished
his
business
.
Upon
which
Mr
Dowling
withdrew
,
*NL*
and
Mrs
Miller
introduced
Mr
Nightingale
the
younger
,
to
return
thanks
*NL*
for
the
great
kindness
done
him
by
Allworthy
:
but
she
had
scarce
*NL*
patience
to
let
the
young
gentleman
finish
his
speech
before
she
*NL*
interrupted
him
,
saying
,
``
O
sir
!
Mr
Nightingale
brings
great
news
*NL*
about
poor
Mr
Jones
:
he
hath
been
to
see
the
wounded
gentleman
,
who
is
*NL*
out
of
all
danger
of
death
,
and
,
what
is
more
,
declares
he
fell
upon
*NL*
poor
Mr
Jones
himself
,
and
beat
him
.
I
am
sure
,
sir
,
you
would
not
*NL*
have
Mr
Jones
be
a
coward
.
If
I
was
a
man
myself
,
I
am
sure
,
if
any
*NL*
man
was
to
strike
me
,
I
should
draw
my
sword
.
Do
pray
,
my
dear
,
tell
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
,
tell
him
all
yourself
.
''
Nightingale
then
confirmed
what
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
had
said
;
and
concluded
with
many
handsome
things
of
Jones
,
*NL*
who
was
,
he
said
,
one
of
the
best-natured
fellows
in
the
world
,
and
*NL*
not
in
the
least
inclined
to
be
quarrelsome
.
Here
Nightingale
was
*NL*
going
to
cease
,
when
Mrs
Miller
again
begged
him
to
relate
all
the
*NL*
many
dutiful
expressions
he
had
heard
him
make
use
of
towards
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
.
``
To
say
the
utmost
good
of
Mr
Allworthy
,
''
cries
*NL*
Nightingale
,
``
is
doing
no
more
than
strict
justice
,
and
can
have
no
*NL*
merit
in
it
:
but
indeed
,
I
must
say
,
no
man
can
be
more
sensible
of
*NL*
the
obligations
he
hath
to
so
good
a
man
than
is
poor
Jones
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
am
convinced
the
weight
of
your
displeasure
is
the
heaviest
*NL*
burthen
he
lies
under
.
He
hath
often
lamented
it
to
me
,
and
hath
as
*NL*
often
protested
in
the
most
solemn
manner
he
hath
never
been
*NL*
intentionally
guilty
of
any
offence
towards
you
;
nay
,
he
hath
sworn
he
*NL*
would
rather
die
a
thousand
deaths
than
he
would
have
his
conscience
*NL*
upbraid
him
with
one
disrespectful
,
ungrateful
,
or
undutiful
thought
*NL*
towards
you
.
But
I
ask
pardon
,
sir
,
I
am
afraid
I
presume
to
*NL*
intermeddle
too
far
in
so
tender
a
point
.
''
``
You
have
spoke
no
more
*NL*
than
what
a
Christian
ought
,
''
cries
Mrs
Miller
.
``
Indeed
,
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
,
''
answered
Allworthy
,
``
I
applaud
your
generous
friendship
,
*NL*
and
I
wish
he
may
merit
it
of
you
.
I
confess
I
am
glad
to
hear
the
*NL*
report
you
bring
from
this
unfortunate
gentleman
;
and
,
if
that
matter
*NL*
should
turn
out
to
be
as
you
represent
it
-LRB-
and
,
indeed
,
I
doubt
*NL*
nothing
of
what
you
say
-RRB-
,
I
may
,
perhaps
,
in
time
,
be
brought
to
think
*NL*
better
than
lately
I
have
of
this
young
man
;
for
this
good
gentlewoman
*NL*
here
,
nay
,
all
who
know
me
,
can
witness
that
I
loved
him
as
dearly
as
*NL*
if
he
had
been
my
own
son
.
Indeed
,
I
have
considered
him
as
a
child
*NL*
sent
by
fortune
to
my
care
.
I
still
remember
the
innocent
,
the
*NL*
helpless
situation
in
which
I
found
him
.
I
feel
the
tender
pressure
of
*NL*
his
little
hands
at
this
moment
.
He
was
my
darling
,
indeed
he
was
.
''
At
*NL*
which
words
he
ceased
,
and
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
answer
which
Mrs
Miller
made
may
lead
us
into
fresh
matters
,
we
*NL*
will
here
stop
to
account
for
the
visible
alteration
in
Mr
Allworthy
's
*NL*
mind
,
and
the
abatement
of
his
anger
to
Jones
.
Revolutions
of
this
*NL*
kind
,
it
is
true
,
do
frequently
occur
in
histories
and
dramatic
*NL*
writers
,
for
no
other
reason
than
because
the
history
or
play
draws
to
*NL*
a
conclusion
,
and
are
justified
by
authority
of
authors
;
yet
,
though
*NL*
we
insist
upon
as
much
authority
as
any
author
whatever
,
we
shall
use
*NL*
this
power
very
sparingly
,
and
never
but
when
we
are
driven
to
it
by
*NL*
necessity
,
which
we
do
not
at
present
foresee
will
happen
in
this
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
alteration
then
in
the
mind
of
Mr
Allworthy
was
occasioned
by
a
*NL*
letter
he
had
just
received
from
Mr
Square
,
and
which
we
shall
give
*NL*
the
reader
in
the
beginning
of
the
next
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
iv
.
*NL*
*NL*
Containing
two
letters
in
very
different
stiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
MY
WORTHY
FRIEND
,
--
I
informed
you
in
my
last
that
I
was
forbidden
*NL*
the
use
of
the
waters
,
as
they
were
found
by
experience
rather
to
*NL*
increase
than
lessen
the
symptoms
of
my
distemper
.
I
must
now
*NL*
acquaint
you
with
a
piece
of
news
,
which
,
I
believe
,
will
afflict
my
*NL*
friends
more
than
it
hath
afflicted
me
.
Dr
Harrington
and
Dr
*NL*
Brewster
have
informed
me
that
there
is
no
hopes
of
my
recovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
somewhere
read
,
that
the
great
use
of
philosophy
is
to
learn
*NL*
to
die
.
I
will
not
therefore
so
far
disgrace
mine
as
to
shew
any
*NL*
surprize
at
receiving
a
lesson
which
I
must
be
thought
to
have
so
*NL*
long
studied
.
Yet
,
to
say
the
truth
,
one
page
of
the
Gospel
teaches
*NL*
this
lesson
better
than
all
the
volumes
of
antient
or
modern
*NL*
philosophers
.
The
assurance
it
gives
us
of
another
life
is
a
much
*NL*
stronger
support
to
a
good
mind
than
all
the
consolations
that
are
*NL*
drawn
from
the
necessity
of
nature
,
the
emptiness
or
satiety
of
our
*NL*
enjoyments
here
,
or
any
other
topic
of
those
declamations
which
are
*NL*
sometimes
capable
of
arming
our
minds
with
a
stubborn
patience
in
*NL*
bearing
the
thoughts
of
death
,
but
never
of
raising
them
to
a
real
*NL*
contempt
of
it
,
and
much
less
of
making
us
think
it
is
a
real
good
.
*NL*
I
would
not
here
be
understood
to
throw
the
horrid
censure
of
*NL*
atheism
,
or
even
the
absolute
denial
of
immortality
,
on
all
who
are
*NL*
called
philosophers
.
Many
of
that
sect
,
as
well
antient
as
modern
,
*NL*
have
,
from
the
light
of
reason
,
discovered
some
hopes
of
a
future
*NL*
state
;
but
in
reality
,
that
light
was
so
faint
and
glimmering
,
and
*NL*
the
hopes
were
so
incertain
and
precarious
,
that
it
may
be
justly
*NL*
doubted
on
which
side
their
belief
turned
.
Plato
himself
concludes
*NL*
his
Phaedon
with
declaring
that
his
best
arguments
amount
only
to
*NL*
raise
a
probability
;
and
Cicero
himself
seems
rather
to
profess
an
*NL*
inclination
to
believe
,
than
any
actual
belief
in
the
doctrines
of
*NL*
immortality
.
As
to
myself
,
to
be
very
sincere
with
you
,
I
never
was
*NL*
much
in
earnest
in
this
faith
till
I
was
in
earnest
a
Christian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
perhaps
wonder
at
the
latter
expression
;
but
I
assure
you
*NL*
it
hath
not
been
till
very
lately
that
I
could
,
with
truth
,
call
*NL*
myself
so
.
The
pride
of
philosophy
had
intoxicated
my
reason
,
and
*NL*
the
sublimest
of
all
wisdom
appeared
to
me
,
as
it
did
to
the
Greeks
*NL*
of
old
,
to
be
foolishness
.
God
hath
,
however
,
been
so
gracious
to
*NL*
shew
me
my
error
in
time
,
and
to
bring
me
into
the
way
of
truth
,
*NL*
before
I
sunk
into
utter
darkness
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
find
myself
beginning
to
grow
weak
,
I
shall
therefore
hasten
to
*NL*
the
main
purpose
of
this
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
reflect
on
the
actions
of
my
past
life
,
I
know
of
nothing
*NL*
which
sits
heavier
upon
my
conscience
than
the
injustice
I
have
been
*NL*
guilty
of
to
that
poor
wretch
your
adopted
son
.
I
have
,
indeed
,
not
*NL*
only
connived
at
the
villany
of
others
,
but
been
myself
active
in
*NL*
injustice
towards
him
.
Believe
me
,
my
dear
friend
,
when
I
tell
you
,
*NL*
on
the
word
of
a
dying
man
,
he
hath
been
basely
injured
.
As
to
the
*NL*
principal
fact
,
upon
the
misrepresentation
of
which
you
discarded
*NL*
him
,
I
solemnly
assure
you
he
is
innocent
.
When
you
lay
upon
your
*NL*
supposed
deathbed
,
he
was
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
testified
*NL*
any
real
concern
;
and
what
happened
afterwards
arose
from
the
*NL*
wildness
of
his
joy
on
your
recovery
;
and
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
it
,
*NL*
from
the
baseness
of
another
person
-LRB-
but
it
is
my
desire
to
justify
*NL*
the
innocent
,
and
to
accuse
none
-RRB-
.
Believe
me
,
my
friend
,
this
young
*NL*
man
hath
the
noblest
generosity
of
heart
,
the
most
perfect
capacity
*NL*
for
friendship
,
the
highest
integrity
,
and
indeed
every
virtue
which
*NL*
can
ennoble
a
man
.
He
hath
some
faults
,
but
among
them
is
not
to
be
*NL*
numbered
the
least
want
of
duty
or
gratitude
towards
you
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
I
am
satisfied
,
when
you
dismissed
him
from
your
house
,
*NL*
his
heart
bled
for
you
more
than
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Worldly
motives
were
the
wicked
and
base
reasons
of
my
concealing
*NL*
this
from
you
so
long
;
to
reveal
it
now
I
can
have
no
inducement
but
*NL*
the
desire
of
serving
the
cause
of
truth
,
of
doing
right
to
the
*NL*
innocent
,
and
of
making
all
the
amends
in
my
power
for
a
past
*NL*
offence
.
I
hope
this
declaration
,
therefore
,
will
have
the
effect
*NL*
desired
,
and
will
restore
this
deserving
young
man
to
your
favour
;
*NL*
the
hearing
of
which
,
while
I
am
yet
alive
,
will
afford
the
utmost
*NL*
consolation
to
,

obliged

The
reader
will
,
after
this

scarce
wonder
at
the
revolution
so
*NL*
visibly
appearing
in
Mr
Allworthy
,
notwithstanding
he
received
from
*NL*
Thwackum
,
by
the
same
post
,
another
letter
of
a
very
different
kind
,
*NL*

we
shall
here
add
,
as
it
may
possibly
be
the
last
time
we
shall

have
occasion

Mr

I
shall
not
wonder
at
any
murders
he
may
commit

I
*NL*
heartily
pray
that
your
own
blood
may
not
seal
up
his

gnashing
of

Though

calls

this
*NL*
wretch

so
much
to
the
prejudice
of
your

of

your
character

I
say
,
though
these
may
sufficiently
be
supposed

prick

goad
your

wanting

I
spared
to
give
you
some
admonition
in
order
*NL*
to
bring
you
to
a
due
sense
of
your
errors
.
I
therefore
pray
you
*NL*
seriously
to
consider
the
judgment
which
is
likely
to
overtake
this
*NL*
wicked
villain
;
and
let
it
serve
at
least
as
a
warning
to
you

that
*NL*
you
may
not
for

despise
the

Had
not

of
a
boy

whom
from
his

infancy
I
discovered
the

had
taken
such
entire

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
Thwackum
ever
wrote
in
this
authoritative
*NL*
stile
to
Allworthy
,
and
of
this
he
had
afterwards
sufficient
reason
to
*NL*
repent
,
as
in
the
case
of
those
who
mistake
the
highest
degree
of
*NL*
goodness
for
the
lowest
degree
of
weakness
.
Allworthy
had
indeed
never
*NL*
liked
this
man
.
He
knew
him
to
be
proud
and
ill-natured
;
he
also
knew
*NL*
that
his
divinity
itself
was
tinctured
with
his
temper
,
and
such
as
in
*NL*
many
respects
he
himself
did
by
no
means
approve
;
but
he
was
at
the
*NL*
same
time
an
excellent
scholar
,
and
most
indefatigable
in
teaching
the
*NL*
two
lads
.
Add
to
this
,
the
strict
severity
of
his
life
and
manners
,
an
*NL*
unimpeached
honesty
,
and
a
most
devout
attachment
to
religion
.
So
*NL*
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
though
Allworthy
did
not
esteem
nor
love
the
*NL*
man
,
yet
he
could
never
bring
himself
to
part
with
a
tutor
to
the
*NL*
boys
,
who
was
,
both
by
learning
and
industry
,
extremely
well
qualified
*NL*
for
his
office
;
and
he
hoped
,
that
as
they
were
bred
up
in
his
own
*NL*
house
,
and
under
his
own
eye
,
he
should
be
able
to
correct
whatever
*NL*
was
wrong
in
Thwackum
's
instructions

In
which
the
history
is
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
,
in
his
last
speech
,
had
recollected
some
tender
ideas
*NL*
concerning
Jones
,
which
had
brought
tears
into
the
good
man
's
eyes
.
*NL*
This
Mrs
Miller
observing
,
said
,
``
Yes
,
yes
,
sir
,
your
goodness
to
this
*NL*
poor
young
man
is
known
,
notwithstanding
all
your
care
to
conceal
it
;
*NL*
but
there
is
not
a
single
syllable
of
truth
in
what
those
villains
*NL*
said
.
Mr
Nightingale
hath
now
discovered
the
whole
matter
.
It
seems
*NL*
these
fellows
were
employed
by
a
lord
,
who
is
a
rival
of
poor
Mr
*NL*
Jones
,
to
have
pressed
him
on
board
a
ship
.
--
I
assure
them
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
who
they
will
press
next
.
Mr
Nightingale
here
hath
seen
the
*NL*
officer
himself
,
who
is
a
very
pretty
gentleman
,
and
hath
told
him
*NL*
all
,
and
is
very
sorry
for
what
he
undertook
,
which
he
would
never
*NL*
have
done
,
had
he
known
Mr
Jones
to
have
been
a
gentleman
;
but
he
was
*NL*
told
that
he
was
a
common
strolling
vagabond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
stared
at
all
this
,
and
declared
he
was
a
stranger
to
every
*NL*
word
she
said
.
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
answered
she
,
``
I
believe
you
are
.
--
It
is
*NL*
a
very
different
story
,
I
believe
,
from
what
those
fellows
told
this
*NL*
lawyer
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
lawyer
,
madam
?
what
is
it
you
mean

said
Allworthy
.
``
Nay

nay

*NL*
said
she
,
``
this
is
so
like
you
to
deny
your
own
goodness

but
Mr
*NL*
Nightingale
here
saw
him
.

``
Saw
whom
,
madam

answered
he
.
``
Why
,
your
*NL*
lawyer
,
sir

said
she
,
``
that
you
so
kindly
sent
to
enquire
into

``
I
am
still
in
the
dark

Allworthy

*NL*
``
Why
then
do
you
tell
him
,
my
dear
sir

cries
she
.
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
said
Nightingale
,
``
I
did
see
that
very
lawyer
who
went
from
you
when
I
*NL*
came
into
the
room
,
at
an
alehouse
in
Aldersgate
,
in
company
with
two
*NL*
of
the
fellows
who
were
employed
by
Lord
Fellamar
to
press
Mr
Jones
,
*NL*
and
who
were
by
that
means
present
at
the
unhappy
rencounter
between
*NL*
him
and
Mr
Fitzpatrick

``
I
own

said
Mrs
Miller
,
``
when
I
saw
*NL*
this
gentleman
come
into
the
room
to
you

I
told
Mr
Nightingale
that
I
*NL*
apprehended
you
had
sent
him
thither
to
inquire
into
the
affair

''
*NL*
Allworthy
shewed
marks
of
astonishment
in
his
countenance
at
this
*NL*
news
,
and
was
indeed
for
two
or
three
minutes
struck
dumb
by
it
.
At
*NL*
last
,
addressing
himself
to
Mr
Nightingale
,
he
said
,
``
I
must
confess
*NL*
myself
,

more
surprized
at
what
you
tell
me
than
I
have
ever
been
*NL*
before
at
anything
in
my
whole
life

Are
you
certain
this
was
the
*NL*
gentleman
?

``
I
am
most
certain

''
answered
Nightingale
.
``
At
*NL*
Aldersgate
?

cries
Allworthy
.
``
And
was
you
in
company
with
this
lawyer
*NL*

the
two
fellows
?

``
I
was

said
the
other
,
``
very
near
half
*NL*
an
hour

``
Well

said
Allworthy
,
``

in
what
manner
did
the

behave

you
hear
all
that
past
between

fellows

``
No

answered
Nightingale
,
``
they
had
been
together

before
I
came

In
my
presence
the
lawyer
said
little
;
but
,
after
I
*NL*
had
several
times
examined
the
fellows
,
who
persisted
in
a
story
*NL*
directly
contrary
to
what
I
had
heard
from
Mr
Jones
,
and
which
I
find
*NL*
by
Mr
Fitzpatrick
was
a
rank
falshood
,
the
lawyer
then
desired
the
*NL*
fellows
to
say
nothing
but
what
was
the
truth
,
and
seemed
to
speak
so
*NL*
much
in
favour
of
Mr
Jones
,
that
,
when
I
saw
the
same
person
with
you
,
*NL*
I
concluded
your
goodness
had
prompted
you
to
send
him
thither
.

--
``
And
*NL*
did
you
not
send
him
thither

says
Mrs
Miller
.
--
``
Indeed
I
did
not

*NL*
answered
Allworthy
;
``
nor
did
I
know
he
had
gone
on
such
an
errand
till
*NL*
this
moment

``
I
see
it
all

said
Mrs
Miller

``
upon
my
soul

it

been
closeted

went
out

returned
with

woman
,
whose
*NL*
spirits
were
all
up
in
arms
in
the
cause
of
her
friend
.
He
was
not
*NL*
however
without
some
suspicions
which
were
near
akin
to
hers
.
When
*NL*
Blifil
came
into
the
room
,
he
asked
him
with
a
very
serious
*NL*
countenance
,
and
with
a
less
friendly
look
than
he
had
ever
before
*NL*
given
him
,
``
Whether
he
knew
anything
of
Mr
Dowling
's
having
seen
any
*NL*
of
the
persons
who
were
present
at
the
duel
between
Jones
and
another
*NL*
gentleman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
so
dangerous
as
a
question
which
comes
by
surprize
on
*NL*
a
man
whose
business
it
is
to
conceal
truth
,
or
to
defend
falshood
.
*NL*
For
which
reason
those
worthy
personages
,
whose
noble
office
it
is
to
*NL*
save
the
lives
of
their
fellow-creatures
at
the
Old
Bailey
,
take
the
*NL*
utmost
care
,
by
frequent
previous
examination
,
to
divine
every
*NL*
question
which
may
be
asked
their
clients
on
the
day
of
tryal
,
that
*NL*
they
may
be
supplyed
with
proper
and
ready
answers
,
which
the
most
*NL*
fertile
invention
can
not
supply
in
an
instant
.
Besides
,
the
sudden
and
*NL*
violent
impulse
on
the
blood
,
occasioned
by
these
surprizes
,
causes
*NL*
frequently
such
an
alteration
in
the
countenance
,
that
the
man
is
*NL*
obliged
to
give
evidence
against
himself
.
And
such
indeed
were
the
*NL*
alterations
which
the
countenance
of
Blifil
underwent
from
this
sudden
*NL*
question
,
that
we
can
scarce
blame
the
eagerness
of
Mrs
Miller
,
who
*NL*
immediately
cryed
out
,
``
Guilty
,
upon
my
honour
!
guilty
,
upon
my
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
sharply
rebuked
her
for
this
impetuosity
;
and
then
*NL*
turning
to
Blifil
,
who
seemed
sinking
into
the
earth
,
he
said
,
``
Why
do
*NL*
you
hesitate
,
sir
,
at
giving
me
an
answer
?
You
certainly
must
have
*NL*
employed
him
;
for
he
would
not
,
of
his
own
accord
,
I
believe
,
have
*NL*
undertaken
such
an
errand
,
and
especially
without
acquainting
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
then
answered
,
``
I
own
,
sir
,
I
have
been
guilty
of
an
offence
,
*NL*
yet
may
I
hope
your
pardon
?
''
--
``
My
pardon
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
very
*NL*
angrily
.
--
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
answered
Blifil
,
``
I
knew
you
would
be
offended
;
*NL*
yet
surely
my
dear
uncle
will
forgive
the
effects
of
the
most
amiable
*NL*
of
human
weaknesses
.
Compassion
for
those
who
do
not
deserve
it
,
I
own
*NL*
is
a
crime
;
and
yet
it
is
a
crime
from
which
you
yourself
are
not
*NL*
entirely
free
.
I
know
I
have
been
guilty
of
it
in
more
than
one
*NL*
instance
to
this
very
person
;
and
I
will
own
I
did
send
Mr
Dowling
,
*NL*
not
on
a
vain
and
fruitless
enquiry
,
but
to
discover
the
witnesses
,
*NL*
and
to
endeavour
to
soften
their
evidence
.
This
,
sir
,
is
the
truth
;
*NL*
which
,
though
I
intended
to
conceal
from
you
,
I
will
not
deny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
confess
,
''
said
Nightingale
,
``
this
is
the
light
in
which
it
appeared
*NL*
to
me
from
the
gentleman
's
behaviour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
madam
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
I
believe
you
will
once
in
your
life
*NL*
own
you
have
entertained
a
wrong
suspicion
,
and
are
not
so
angry
with
*NL*
my
nephew
as
you
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
was
silent
;
for
,
though
she
could
not
so
hastily
be
pleased
*NL*
with
Blifil
,
whom
she
looked
upon
to
have
been
the
ruin
of
Jones
,
yet
*NL*
in
this
particular
instance
he
had
imposed
upon
her
as
well
as
upon
*NL*
the
rest
;
so
entirely
had
the
devil
stood
his
friend
.
And
,
indeed
,
I
*NL*
look
upon
the
vulgar
observation
,
``
That
the
devil
often
deserts
his
*NL*
friends
,
and
leaves
them
in
the
lurch
,
''
to
be
a
great
abuse
on
that
*NL*
gentleman
's
character
.
Perhaps
he
may
sometimes
desert
those
who
are
*NL*
only
his
cup
acquaintance
;
or
who
,
at
most
,
are
but
half
his
;
but
he
*NL*
generally
stands
by
those
who
are
thoroughly
his
servants
,
and
helps
*NL*
them
off
in
all
extremities
,
till
their
bargain
expires
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
conquered
rebellion
strengthens
a
government
,
or
as
health
is
*NL*
more
perfectly
established
by
recovery
from
some
diseases
;
so
anger
,
*NL*
when
removed
,
often
gives
new
life
to
affection
.
This
was
the
case
of
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
;
for
Blifil
having
wiped
off
the
greater
suspicion
,
the
*NL*
lesser
,
which
had
been
raised
by
Square
's
letter
,
sunk
of
course
,
and
*NL*
was
forgotten
;
and
Thwackum
,
with
whom
he
was
greatly
offended
,
bore
*NL*
alone
all
the
reflections
which
Square
had
cast
on
the
enemies
of
*NL*
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
that
young
man
,
the
resentment
of
Mr
Allworthy
began
more
and
*NL*
more
to
abate
towards
him
.
He
told
Blifil
,
``
He
did
not
only
forgive
*NL*
the
extraordinary
efforts
of
his
good-nature
,
but
would
give
him
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
following
his
example
.
''
Then
,
turning
to
Mrs
Miller
with
a
*NL*
smile
which
would
have
become
an
angel
,
he
cryed
,
``
What
say
you
,
*NL*
madam
?
shall
we
take
a
hackney-coach
,
and
all
of
us
together
pay
a
*NL*
visit
to
your
friend
?
I
promise
you
it
is
not
the
first
visit
I
have
*NL*
made
in
a
prison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
reader
,
I
believe
,
will
be
able
to
answer
for
the
worthy
woman
;
*NL*
but
they
must
have
a
great
deal
of
good-nature
,
and
be
well
acquainted
*NL*
with
friendship
,
who
can
feel
what
she
felt
on
this
occasion
.
Few
,
I
*NL*
hope
,
are
capable
of
feeling
what
now
passed
in
the
mind
of
Blifil
;
*NL*
but
those
who
are
will
acknowledge
that
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
*NL*
raise
any
objection
to
this
visit
.
Fortune
,
however
,
or
the
gentleman
*NL*
lately
mentioned
above
,
stood
his
friend
,
and
prevented
his
undergoing
*NL*
so
great
a
shock
;
for
at
the
very
instant
when
the
coach
was
sent
for
,
*NL*
Partridge
arrived
,
and
,
having
called
Mrs
Miller
from
the
company
,
*NL*
acquainted
her
with
the
dreadful
accident
lately
come
to
light
;
and
*NL*
hearing
Mr
Allworthy
's
intention
,
begged
her
to
find
some
means
of
*NL*
stopping
him
:
``
For
,
''
says
he
,
``
the
matter
must
at
all
hazards
be
kept
*NL*
a
secret
from
him
;
and
if
he
should
now
go
,
he
will
find
Mr
Jones
and
*NL*
his
mother
,
who
arrived
just
as
I
left
him
,
lamenting
over
one
another
*NL*
the
horrid
crime
they
have
ignorantly
committed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
woman
,
who
was
almost
deprived
of
her
senses
at
his
dreadful
*NL*
news
,
was
never
less
capable
of
invention
than
at
present
.
However
,
as
*NL*
women
are
much
readier
at
this
than
men
,
she
bethought
herself
of
an
*NL*
excuse
,
and
,
returning
to
Allworthy
,
said
,
``
I
am
sure
,
sir
,
you
will
*NL*
be
surprized
at
hearing
any
objection
from
me
to
the
kind
proposal
you
*NL*
just
now
made
;
and
yet
I
am
afraid
of
the
consequence
of
it
,
if
*NL*
carried
immediately
into
execution
.
You
must
imagine
,
sir
,
that
all
*NL*
the
calamities
which
have
lately
befallen
this
poor
young
fellow
must
*NL*
have
thrown
him
into
the
lowest
dejection
of
spirits
;
and
now
,
sir
,
*NL*
should
we
all
on
a
sudden
fling
him
into
such
a
violent
fit
of
joy
,
as
*NL*
I
know
your
presence
will
occasion
,
it
may
,
I
am
afraid
,
produce
some
*NL*
fatal
mischief
,
especially
as
his
servant
,
who
is
without
,
tells
me
he
*NL*
is
very
far
from
being
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
his
servant
without
?
''
cries
Allworthy
;
``
pray
call
him
hither
.
I
*NL*
will
ask
him
some
questions
concerning
his
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
was
at
first
afraid
to
appear
before
Mr
Allworthy
;
but
was
*NL*
at
length
persuaded
,
after
Mrs
Miller
,
who
had
often
heard
his
whole
*NL*
story
from
his
own
mouth
,
had
promised
to
introduce
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
recollected
Partridge
the
moment
he
came
into
the
room
,
*NL*
though
many
years
had
passed
since
he
had
seen
him
.
Mrs
Miller
,
*NL*
therefore
,
might
have
spared
here
a
formal
oration
,
in
which
,
indeed
,
*NL*
she
was
something
prolix
;
for
the
reader
,
I
believe
,
may
have
observed
*NL*
already
that
the
good
woman
,
among
other
things
,
had
a
tongue
always
*NL*
ready
for
the
service
of
her
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
are
you
,
''
said
Allworthy
to
Partridge
,
``
the
servant
of
Mr
Jones
?
''
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
,
sir
,
''
answered
he
,
``
that
I
am
regularly
a
servant
,
but
I
*NL*
live
with
him
,
a
n't
please
your
honour
,
at
present
.
_
Non
sum
qualis
*NL*
eram
_
,
as
your
honour
very
well
knows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Allworthy
then
asked
him
many
questions
concerning
Jones
,
as
to
his
*NL*
health
,
and
other
matters
;
to
all
which
Partridge
answered
,
without
*NL*
having
the
least
regard
to
what
was
,
but
considered
only
what
he
would
*NL*
have
things
appear
;
for
a
strict
adherence
to
truth
was
not
among
the
*NL*
articles
of
this
honest
fellow
's
morality
or
his
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
dialogue
Mr
Nightingale
took
his
leave
,
and
presently
*NL*
after
Mrs
Miller
left
the
room
,
when
Allworthy
likewise
despatched
*NL*
Blifil
;
for
he
imagined
that
Partridge
when
alone
with
him
would
be
*NL*
more
explicit
than
before
company
.
They
were
no
sooner
left
in
private
*NL*
together
than
Allworthy
began
,
as
in
the
following
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
vi
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
the
history
is
farther
continued
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
friend
,
''
said
the
good
man
,
``
you
are
the
strangest
of
all
human
*NL*
beings
.
Not
only
to
have
suffered
as
you
have
formerly
for
obstinately
*NL*
persisting
in
a
falshood
,
but
to
persist
in
it
thus
to
the
last
,
and
*NL*
to
pass
thus
upon
the
world
for
a
servant
of
your
own
son
!
What
*NL*
interest
can
you
have
in
all
this
?
What
can
be
your
motive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
sir
,
''
said
Partridge
,
falling
down
upon
his
knees
,
``
that
your
*NL*
honour
is
prepossessed
against
me
,
and
resolved
not
to
believe
*NL*
anything
I
say
,
and
,
therefore
,
what
signifies
my
protestations
?
but
*NL*
yet
there
is
one
above
who
knows
that
I
am
not
the
father
of
this
*NL*
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
!
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
will
you
yet
deny
what
you
was
formerly
*NL*
convicted
of
upon
such
unanswerable
,
such
manifest
evidence
?
Nay
,
what
*NL*
a
confirmation
is
your
being
now
found
with
this
very
man
,
of
all
*NL*
which
twenty
years
ago
appeared
against
you
!
I
thought
you
had
left
*NL*
the
country
!
nay
,
I
thought
you
had
been
long
since
dead
.
--
In
what
*NL*
manner
did
you
know
anything
of
this
young
man
?
Where
did
you
meet
*NL*
with
him
,
unless
you
had
kept
some
correspondence
together
?
Do
not
*NL*
deny
this
;
for
I
promise
you
it
will
greatly
raise
your
son
in
my
*NL*
opinion
,
to
find
that
he
hath
such
a
sense
of
filial
duty
as
privately
*NL*
to
support
his
father
for
so
many
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
your
honour
will
have
patience
to
hear
me
,
''
said
Partridge
,
``
I
*NL*
will
tell
you
all
.
''
--
Being
bid
go
on
,
he
proceeded
thus
:
``
When
your
*NL*
honour
conceived
that
displeasure
against
me
,
it
ended
in
my
ruin
soon
*NL*
after
;
for
I
lost
my
little
school
;
and
the
minister
,
thinking
I
*NL*
suppose
it
would
be
agreeable
to
your
honour
,
turned
me
out
from
the
*NL*
office
of
clerk
;
so
that
I
had
nothing
to
trust
to
but
the
barber
's
*NL*
shop
,
which
,
in
a
country
place
like
that
,
is
a
poor
livelihood
;
and
*NL*
when
my
wife
died
-LRB-
for
till
that
time
I
received
a
pension
of
L12
a
*NL*
year
from
an
unknown
hand
,
which
indeed
I
believe
was
your
honour
's
*NL*
own
,
for
nobody
that
ever
I
heard
of
doth
these
things
besides
-RRB-
--
but
,
*NL*
as
I
was
saying
,
when
she
died
,
this
pension
forsook
me
;
so
that
now
,
*NL*
as
I
owed
two
or
three
small
debts
,
which
began
to
be
troublesome
to
*NL*
me
,
particularly
one
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
which
an
attorney
brought
up
by
law-charges
*NL*
from
15s
.
to
near
L30
,
and
as
I
found
all
my
usual
means
of
living
had
*NL*
forsook
me
,
I
packed
up
my
little
all
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
went
*NL*
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
*
-RSB-
This
is
a
fact
which
I
knew
happen
to
a
poor
clergyman
in
*NL*
Dorsetshire
,
by
the
villany
of
an
attorney
who
,
not
contented
with
*NL*
the
exorbitant
costs
to
which
the
poor
man
was
put
by
a
single
*NL*
action
,
brought
afterwards
another
action
on
the
judgment
,
as
it
was
*NL*
called
.
A
method
frequently
used
to
oppress
the
poor
,
and
bring
*NL*
money
into
the
pockets
of
attorneys
,
to
the
great
scandal
of
the
*NL*
law
,
of
the
nation
,
of
Christianity
,
and
even
of
human
nature
*NL*
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
place
I
came
to
was
Salisbury
,
where
I
got
into
the
service
*NL*
of
a
gentleman
belonging
to
the
law
,
and
one
of
the
best
gentlemen
*NL*
that
ever
I
knew
,
for
he
was
not
only
good
to
me
,
but
I
know
a
*NL*
thousand
good
and
charitable
acts
which
he
did
while
I
staid
with
him
;
*NL*
and
I
have
known
him
often
refuse
business
because
it
was
paultry
and
*NL*
oppressive
.
''
``
You
need
not
be
so
particular
,
''
said
Allworthy
;
``
I
know
*NL*
this
gentleman
,
and
a
very
worthy
man
he
is
,
and
an
honour
to
his
*NL*
profession
.
''
--
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
continued
Partridge
,
``
from
hence
I
removed
*NL*
to
Lymington
,
where
I
was
above
three
years
in
the
service
of
another
*NL*
lawyer
,
who
was
likewise
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
,
and
to
be
sure
one
*NL*
of
the
merriest
gentlemen
in
England
.
Well
,
sir
,
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
three
years
I
set
up
a
little
school
,
and
was
likely
to
do
well
again
,
*NL*
had
it
not
been
for
a
most
unlucky
accident
.
Here
I
kept
a
pig
;
and
*NL*
one
day
,
as
ill
fortune
would
have
it
,
this
pig
broke
out
,
and
did
a
*NL*
trespass
,
I
think
they
call
it
,
in
a
garden
belonging
to
one
of
my
*NL*
neighbours
,
who
was
a
proud
,
revengeful
man
,
and
employed
a
lawyer
,
*NL*
one
--
one
--
I
ca
n't
think
of
his
name
;
but
he
sent
for
a
writ
against
*NL*
me
,
and
had
me
to
size
.
When
I
came
there
,
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
--
to
*NL*
hear
what
the
counsellors
said
!
There
was
one
that
told
my
lord
a
*NL*
parcel
of
the
confoundedest
lies
about
me
;
he
said
that
I
used
to
*NL*
drive
my
hogs
into
other
folk
's
gardens
,
and
a
great
deal
more
;
and
at
*NL*
last
he
said
,
he
hoped
I
had
at
last
brought
my
hogs
to
a
fair
market
.
*NL*
To
be
sure
,
one
would
have
thought
that
,
instead
of
being
owner
only
*NL*
of
one
poor
little
pig
,
I
had
been
the
greatest
hog-merchant
in
*NL*
England
.
Well
--
''
``
Pray
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
do
not
be
so
particular
,
I
*NL*
have
heard
nothing
of
your
son
yet
.
''
``
O
it
was
a
great
many
years
,
''
*NL*
answered
Partridge
,
``
before
I
saw
my
son
,
as
you
are
pleased
to
call
*NL*
him
.
--
I
went
over
to
Ireland
after
this
,
and
taught
school
at
Cork
*NL*
-LRB-
for
that
one
suit
ruined
me
again
,
and
I
lay
seven
years
in
*NL*
Winchester
jail
-RRB-
.
''
--
``
Well
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
pass
that
over
till
your
*NL*
return
to
England
.
''
--
``
Then
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
was
about
half
a
year
*NL*
ago
that
I
landed
at
Bristol
,
where
I
staid
some
time
,
and
not
finding
*NL*
it
do
there
,
and
hearing
of
a
place
between
that
and
Gloucester
where
*NL*
the
barber
was
just
dead
,
I
went
thither
,
and
there
I
had
been
about
*NL*
two
months
when
Mr
Jones
came
thither
.
''
He
then
gave
Allworthy
a
very
*NL*
particular
account
of
their
first
meeting
,
and
of
everything
,
as
well
*NL*
as
he
could
remember
,
which
had
happened
from
that
day
to
this
;
*NL*
frequently
interlarding
his
story
with
panegyrics
on
Jones
,
and
not
*NL*
forgetting
to
insinuate
the
great
love
and
respect
which
he
had
for
*NL*
Allworthy
.
He
concluded
with
saying
,
``
Now
,
sir
,
I
have
told
your
*NL*
honour
the
whole
truth
.
''
And
then
repeated
a
most
solemn
protestation
,
*NL*
``
That
he
was
no
more
the
father
of
Jones
than
of
the
Pope
of
Rome
;
''
*NL*
and
imprecated
the
most
bitter
curses
on
his
head
,
if
he
did
not
speak
*NL*
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
think
of
this
matter
?
''
cries
Allworthy
.
``
For
what
*NL*
purpose
should
you
so
strongly
deny
a
fact
which
I
think
it
would
be
*NL*
rather
your
interest
to
own
?
''
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
answered
Partridge
-LRB-
for
he
*NL*
could
hold
no
longer
-RRB-
,
``
if
your
honour
will
not
believe
me
,
you
are
*NL*
like
soon
to
have
satisfaction
enough
.
I
wish
you
had
mistaken
the
*NL*
mother
of
this
young
man
,
as
well
as
you
have
his
father
.
''
--
And
now
*NL*
being
asked
what
he
meant
,
with
all
the
symptoms
of
horror
,
both
in
*NL*
his
voice
and
countenance
,
he
told
Allworthy
the
whole
story
,
which
he
*NL*
had
a
little
before
expressed
such
desire
to
Mrs
Miller
to
conceal
*NL*
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
was
almost
as
much
shocked
at
this
discovery
as
Partridge
*NL*
himself
had
been
while
he
related
it
.
``
Good
heavens
!
''
says
he
,
``
in
*NL*
what
miserable
distresses
do
vice
and
imprudence
involve
men
!
How
much
*NL*
beyond
our
designs
are
the
effects
of
wickedness
sometimes
carried
!
''
*NL*
He
had
scarce
uttered
these
words
,
when
Mrs
Waters
came
hastily
and
*NL*
abruptly
into
the
room
.
Partridge
no
sooner
saw
her
than
he
cried
,
*NL*
``
Here
,
sir
,
here
is
the
very
woman
herself
.
This
is
the
unfortunate
*NL*
mother
of
Mr
Jones
.
I
am
sure
she
will
acquit
me
before
your
honour
.
*NL*
Pray
,
madam
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
,
without
paying
any
regard
to
what
Partridge
said
,
and
*NL*
almost
without
taking
any
notice
of
him
,
advanced
to
Mr
Allworthy
.
``
I
*NL*
believe
,
sir
,
it
is
so
long
since
I
had
the
honour
of
seeing
you
,
that
*NL*
you
do
not
recollect
me
.
''
``
Indeed
,
''
answered
Allworthy
,
``
you
are
so
*NL*
very
much
altered
,
on
many
accounts
,
that
had
not
this
man
already
*NL*
acquainted
me
who
you
are
,
I
should
not
have
immediately
called
you
to
*NL*
my
remembrance
.
Have
you
,
madam
,
any
particular
business
which
brings
*NL*
you
to
me
?
''
Allworthy
spoke
this
with
great
reserve
;
for
the
reader
*NL*
may
easily
believe
he
was
not
well
pleased
with
the
conduct
of
this
*NL*
lady
;
neither
with
what
he
had
formerly
heard
,
nor
with
what
Partridge
*NL*
had
now
delivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
answered
--
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
I
have
very
particular
business
*NL*
with
you
;
and
it
is
such
as
I
can
impart
only
to
yourself
.
I
must
*NL*
desire
,
therefore
,
the
favour
of
a
word
with
you
alone
:
for
I
assure
*NL*
you
what
I
have
to
tell
you
is
of
the
utmost
importance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
was
then
ordered
to
withdraw
,
but
before
he
went
,
he
begged
*NL*
the
lady
to
satisfy
Mr
Allworthy
that
he
was
perfectly
innocent
.
To
*NL*
which
she
answered
,
``
You
need
be
under
no
apprehension
,
sir
;
I
shall
*NL*
satisfy
Mr
Allworthy
very
perfectly
of
that
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Partridge
withdrew
,
and
that
past
between
Mr
Allworthy
and
Mrs
*NL*
Waters

is
written
in
the
next
chapter

Continuation
of
the
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
remaining
a
few
moments
silent
,
Mr
Allworthy
could
not
*NL*
refrain
from
saying
,
``
I
am
sorry
,
madam
,
to
perceive
,
by
what
I
have
*NL*
since
heard
,
that
you
have
made
so
very
ill
a
use
--
''
``
Mr
Allworthy
,
''
*NL*
says
she
,
interrupting
him
,
``
I
know
I
have
faults
,
but
ingratitude
to
*NL*
you
is
not
one
of
them
.
I
never
can
nor
shall
forget
your
goodness
,
*NL*
which
I
own
I
have
very
little
deserved
;
but
be
pleased
to
wave
all
*NL*
upbraiding
me
at
present
,
as
I
have
so
important
an
affair
to
*NL*
communicate
to
you
concerning
this
young
man
,
to
whom
you
have
given
*NL*
my
maiden
name
of
Jones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
then
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
ignorantly
punished
an
innocent
man
,
*NL*
in
the
person
of
him
who
hath
just
left
us
?
Was
he
not
the
father
of
*NL*
the
child
?
''
``
Indeed
he
was
not

said
Mrs
Waters
.
``
You
may
be
pleased
*NL*
to
remember
,
sir
,
I
formerly
told
you
,
you
should
one
day
know
;
and
I
*NL*
acknowledge
myself
to
have
been
guilty
of
a
cruel
neglect
,
in
not
*NL*
having
discovered
it
to
you
before
.
Indeed
,
I
little
knew
how
*NL*
necessary
it
was
.
''
``
Well
,
madam
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
be
pleased
to
*NL*
proceed
.
''
``
You
must
remember
,
sir

''
said
she
,
``
a
young
fellow
,
whose
*NL*
name
was
Summer
.
''
``
Very
well
,
''
cries
Allworthy
,
``
he
was
the
son
of
a
*NL*
clergyman
of
great
learning
and
virtue
,
for
whom
I
had
the
highest
*NL*
friendship
.
''
``
So
it
appeared
,
sir
,
''
answered
she
;
``
for
I
believe
you
*NL*
bred
the
young
man
up
,
and
maintained
him
at
the
university
;
where
,
I
*NL*
think
,
he
had
finished
his
studies
,
when
he
came
to
reside
at
your
*NL*
house
;
a
finer
man
,
I
must
say
,
the
sun
never
shone
upon
;
for
,
besides
*NL*
the
handsomest
person
I
ever
saw

he
was
so
genteel

had
so
much

wit

good
breeding

''
``
Poor
gentleman

said
Allworthy
,
``
he
was

indeed
untimely
snatched
away
;

little
did
I
think

had
any
sins

this
kind
to
answer
for

plainly
perceive

*NL*

How
!

said
Allworthy
,
``
to
*NL*
what
then
tends
all
this
preface
?

``
To
a
story

she

Allworthy

not

she

that

in

house

died
there

said
Allworthy
;
``
you
contradict

not

Take

not

falshood

Allworthy

rejoice

``
So
far
what
I
confest

said
she
,
*NL*
``
was
true

that

its

at

commands
I
afterwards

nobly
rewarded

both
*NL*
for

``
Who
could
this
woman
be

said
*NL*
Allworthy
.
``
Indeed

I
tremble
to
name

answered
Mrs
Waters
.
``
By
*NL*
all
this
preparation
I
am
to
guess
that
she
was
a
relation
of
mine

*NL*
cried
he
.
``
Indeed
she
was
a
near
one

''
At
which
words
Allworthy
*NL*
started
,
and
she
continued
--
``
You
had
a
sister
,
sir

''
``
A
sister
!

*NL*
repeated
he
,
looking
aghast
.
--
``
As
there
is
truth
in
heaven
,
''
cries
*NL*
she
,
``
your
sister
was
the
mother
of
that
child
you
found
between
your
*NL*
sheets
.
''
``
Can
it
be
possible
?
''
cries
he
,
``
Good
heavens
!
''
``
Have
*NL*
patience
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs
Waters
,
``
and
I
will
unfold
to
you
the
whole
*NL*
story
.
Just
after
your
departure
for
London
,
Miss
Bridget
came
one
day
*NL*
to
the
house
of
my
mother
.
She
was
pleased
to
say
she
had
heard
an
*NL*
extraordinary
character
of
me
,
for
my
learning
and
superior
*NL*
understanding
to
all
the
young
women
there
,
so
she
was
pleased
to
say
.
*NL*
She
then
bid
me
come
to
her
to
the
great
house
;
where
,
when
I
*NL*
attended
,
she
employed
me
to
read
to
her
.
She
expressed
great
*NL*
satisfaction
in
my
reading
,
shewed
great
kindness
to
me
,
and
made
me
*NL*
many
presents
.
At
last
she
began
to
catechise
me
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
secrecy
,
to
which
I
gave
her
such
satisfactory
answers
,
that
,
at
last
,
*NL*
having
locked
the
door
of
her
room
,
she
took
me
into
her
closet
,
and
*NL*
then
locking
that
door
likewise
,
she
said
she
should
convince
me
of
*NL*
the
vast
reliance
she
had
on
my
integrity
,
by
communicating
a
secret
*NL*
in
which
her
honour
,
and
consequently
her
life
,
was
concerned
.
She
*NL*
then
stopt
,
and
after
a
silence
of
a
few
minutes
,
during
which
she
*NL*
often
wiped
her
eyes
,
she
enquired
of
me
if
I
thought
my
mother
might
*NL*
safely
be
confided
in
.
I
answered
,
I
would
stake
my
life
on
her
*NL*
fidelity
.
She
then
imparted
to
me
the
great
secret
which
laboured
in
*NL*
her
breast
,
and
which
,
I
believe
,
was
delivered
with
more
pains
than
*NL*
she
afterwards
suffered
in
child-birth
.
It
was
then
contrived
that
my
*NL*
mother
and
myself
only
should
attend
at
the
time
,
and
that
Mrs
Wilkins
*NL*
should
be
sent
out
of
the
way
,
as
she
accordingly
was
,
to
the
very
*NL*
furthest
part
of
Dorsetshire
,
to
enquire
the
character
of
a
servant
;
*NL*
for
the
lady
had
turned
away
her
own
maid
near
three
months
before
;
*NL*
during
all
which
time
I
officiated
about
her
person
upon
trial
,
as
she
*NL*
said
,
though
,
as
she
afterwards
declared
,
I
was
not
sufficiently
handy
*NL*
for
the
place
.
This
,
and
many
other
such
things
which
she
used
to
say
*NL*
of
me
,
were
all
thrown
out
to
prevent
any
suspicion
which
Wilkins
*NL*
might
hereafter
have
,
when
I
was
to
own
the
child
;
for
she
thought
it
*NL*
could
never
be
believed
she
would
venture
to
hurt
a
young
woman
with
*NL*
whom
she
had
intrusted
such
a
secret
.
You
may
be
assured
,
sir
,
I
was
*NL*
well
paid
for
all
these
affronts
,
which
,
together
with
being
informed
*NL*
with
the
occasion
of
them
,
very
well
contented
me
.
Indeed
,
the
lady
*NL*
had
a
greater
suspicion
of
Mrs
Wilkins
than
of
any
other
person
;
not
*NL*
that
she
had
the
least
aversion
to
the
gentlewoman
,
but
she
thought
*NL*
her
incapable
of
keeping
a
secret
,
especially
from
you
,
sir
;
for
I
*NL*
have
often
heard
Miss
Bridget
say
,
that
,
if
Mrs
Wilkins
had
committed
*NL*
a
murder
,
she
believed
she
would
acquaint
you
with
it
.
At
last
the
*NL*
expected
day
came
,
and
Mrs
Wilkins
,
who
had
been
kept
a
week
in
*NL*
readiness
,
and
put
off
from
time
to
time
,
upon
some
pretence
or
other
,
*NL*
that
she
might
not
return
too
soon
,
was
dispatched
.
Then
the
child
was
*NL*
born
,
in
the
presence
only
of
myself
and
my
mother
,
and
was
by
my
*NL*
mother
conveyed
to
her
own
house
,
where
it
was
privately
kept
by
her
*NL*
till
the
evening
of
your
return
,
when
I
,
by
the
command
of
Miss
*NL*
Bridget
,
conveyed
it
into
the
bed
where
you
found
it
.
And
all
*NL*
suspicions
were
afterwards
laid
asleep
by
the
artful
conduct
of
your
*NL*
sister
,
in
pretending
ill-will
to
the
boy
,
and
that
any
regard
she
*NL*
shewed
him
was
out
of
meer
complacence
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
then
made
many
protestations
of
the
truth
of
this
story
,
*NL*
and
concluded
by
saying
,
``
Thus
,
sir
,
you
have
at
last
discovered
your
*NL*
nephew
;
for
so
I
am
sure
you
will
hereafter
think
him
,
and
I
question
*NL*
not
but
he
will
be
both
an
honour
and
a
comfort
to
you
under
that
*NL*
appellation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
not
,
madam
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
express
my
astonishment
at
what
*NL*
you
have
told
me
;
and
yet
surely
you
would
not
,
and
could
not
,
have
*NL*
put
together
so
many
circumstances
to
evidence
an
untruth
.
I
confess
I
*NL*
recollect
some
passages
relating
to
that
Summer
,
which
formerly
gave
*NL*
me
a
conceit
that
my
sister
had
some
liking
to
him
.
I
mentioned
it
to
*NL*
her
;
for
I
had
such
a
regard
to
the
young
man
,
as
well
on
his
own
*NL*
account
as
on
his
father
's
,
that
I
should
willingly
have
consented
to
*NL*
a
match
between
them
;
but
she
exprest
the
highest
disdain
of
my
unkind
*NL*
suspicion
,
as
she
called
it
;
so
that
I
never
spoke
more
on
the
*NL*
subject
.
Good
heavens
!
Well
!
the
Lord
disposeth
all
things
.
--
Yet
sure
*NL*
it
was
a
most
unjustifiable
conduct
in
my
sister
to
carry
this
secret
*NL*
with
her
out
of
the
world
.
''
``
I
promise
you
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs
Waters
,
*NL*
``
she
always
profest
a
contrary
intention
,
and
frequently
told
me
she
*NL*
intended
one
day
to
communicate
it
to
you
.
She
said
,
indeed
,
she
was
*NL*
highly
rejoiced
that
her
plot
had
succeeded
so
well
,
and
that
you
had
*NL*
of
your
own
accord
taken
such
a
fancy
to
the
child
,
that
it
was
yet
*NL*
unnecessary
to
make
any
express
declaration
.
Oh
!
sir
,
had
that
lady
*NL*
lived
to
have
seen
this
poor
young
man
turned
like
a
vagabond
from
*NL*
your
house
:
nay
,
sir
,
could
she
have
lived
to
hear
that
you
had
*NL*
yourself
employed
a
lawyer
to
prosecute
him
for
a
murder
of
which
he
*NL*
was
not
guilty
--
Forgive
me
,
Mr
Allworthy
,
I
must
say
it
was
*NL*
unkind
.

Indeed
,
you
have
been
abused
,
he
never
deserved
it
of
you
.
''
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
I
have
been
abused
by
the
person
,
*NL*
whoever
he
was
,
that
told
you
so
.
''
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
would
not
*NL*
be
mistaken
,
I
did
not
presume
to
say
you
were
guilty
of
any
wrong

*NL*
The
gentleman
who
came
to
me
proposed
no
such
matter
;
he
only
said
,
*NL*
taking
me
for
Mr
Fitzpatrick
's
wife
,
that
,
if
Mr
Jones
had
murdered
my
*NL*
husband
,
I
should
be
assisted
with
any
money
I
wanted
to
carry
on
the
*NL*
prosecution
,
by
a
very
worthy
gentleman
,
who
,
he
said
,
was
well
*NL*
apprized
what
a
villain
I
had
to
deal
with
.
It
was
by
this
man
I
found
*NL*
out
who
Mr
Jones
was
;
and
this
man
,
whose
name
is
Dowling
,
Mr
Jones
*NL*
tells
me
is
your
steward
.
I
discovered
his
name
by
a
very
odd
*NL*
accident
;
for
he
himself
refused
to
tell
it
me
;
but
Partridge
,
who
met
*NL*
him
at
my
lodgings
the
second
time
he
came
,
knew
him
formerly
at
*NL*
Salisbury
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
did
this
Mr
Dowling

says
Allworthy
,
with
great
astonishment
*NL*
in
his
countenance
,
``
tell
you
that
I
would
assist
in
the
*NL*
prosecution
?
''
--
``
No
,
sir
,
''
answered
she
,
``
I
will
not
charge
him
*NL*
wrongfully
.
He
said
I
should
be
assisted
,
but
he
mentioned
no
name

*NL*
Yet
you
must
pardon
me
,
sir

if
from
circumstances
I
thought
it
could
*NL*
be
no
other

``
Indeed

Allworthy
,
``
from
circumstances
I
*NL*
am
too
well
convinced

another

Good
Heaven

by
what
wonderful

means
is
the
blackest
and
deepest
villany
sometimes
discovered

Shall

I
beg
you

to
stay

every

nay

he
may
be

perhaps
,
already
in
the
*NL*
house

''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
then
stept
to
the
door
,
in
order
to
call
a
servant
,
when
in
*NL*
came
,
not
Mr

The
gentleman
who
now
arrived
was
no
other
than
Mr
Western
.
He
no
*NL*
sooner
saw
Allworthy
,
than
,
without
considering
in
the
least
the
*NL*
presence
of
Mrs
Waters
,
he
began
to
vociferate
in
the
following
*NL*
manner
:
``
Fine
doings
at
my
house
!
A
rare
kettle
of
fish
I
have
*NL*
discovered
at
last
!
who
the
devil
would
be
plagued
with
a
daughter
?
''
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
neighbour
?
''
said
Allworthy
.
``
Matter
enough
,
''
*NL*
answered
Western
:
``
when
I
thought
she
was
just
a
coming
to
;
nay
,
when
*NL*
she
had
in
a
manner
promised
me
to
do
as
I
would
ha
her
,
and
when
I
*NL*
was
a
hoped
to
have
had
nothing
more
to
do
than
to
have
sent
for
the
*NL*
lawyer
,
and
finished
all
;
what
do
you
think
I
have
found
out
?
that
the
*NL*
little
b
--
hath
bin
playing
tricks
with
me
all
the
while
,
and
carrying
*NL*
on
a
correspondence
with
that
bastard
of
yours
.
Sister
Western
,
whom
I
*NL*
have
quarrelled
with
upon
her
account
,
sent
me
word
o
`
t
,
and
I
ordered
*NL*
her
pockets
to
be
searched
when
she
was
asleep
,
and
here
I
have
got
un
*NL*
signed
with
the
son
of
a
whore
's
own
name
.
I
have
not
had
patience
to
*NL*
read
half
o
`
t
,
for
't
is
longer
than
one
of
parson
Supple
's
sermons
;
*NL*
but
I
find
plainly
it
is
all
about
love
;
and
indeed
what
should
it
be
*NL*
else
?
I
have
packed
her
up
in
chamber
again
,
and
to-morrow
morning
*NL*
down
she
goes
into
the
country
,
unless
she
consents
to
be
married
*NL*
directly
,
and
there
she
shall
live
in
a
garret
upon
bread
and
water
*NL*
all
her
days
;
and
the
sooner
such
a
b

breaks
her
heart
the
better

her

I

too
tough

She
will
live
long

enough
to
plague
me

``
Mr
Western

answered
Allworthy
,
``
you
know
I
*NL*
have
always
protested
against
force

yourself
consented

``
Ay

cries
he
,

that
was

``
Well

answered
Allworthy
,
``
if

you
will
give
me
leave

will
undertake
once
to
argue
with
the
young

``
Will
you

said
Western
;
``
why
that
is
kind
now

*NL*
neighbourly

mayhap
you
will
do
more
than
I

able

do

Well

``
But
suppose

said
Western
,
``
she
should
run
away

For
lawyer
Dowling
tells
me
there
is
no

hanging

alive

How

Allworthy

him
then
to
enquire
or
to

do
anything

the

As
soon
as
Mr

gone
Mrs
Waters
said
,

``
Indeed

says
she
,

I
was
ruined

knew

though
I
pretend
not
to
think
it
would
justify
me
in
your

opinion

it
would
at

mitigate
my
offence

induce
you
to
pity

you
are
not
now

hear
my
whole

this
I

assure

most
solemn
promises
of
marriage

was
married

*NL*
only
requisite
to
give
a
legal
sanction
to
marriage
,
and
have
only
a
*NL*
worldly
use
in
giving
a
woman
the
privileges
of
a
wife
;
but
that
she
*NL*
who
lives
constant
to
one
man
,
after
a
solemn
private
affiance
,
*NL*
whatever
the
world
may
call
her
,
hath
little
to
charge
on
her
own
*NL*
conscience
.
''
``
I
am
sorry
,
madam
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
you
made
so
ill
a
*NL*
use
of
your
learning
.
Indeed
,
it
would
have
been
well
that
you
had
*NL*
been
possessed
of
much
more
,
or
had
remained
in
a
state
of
ignorance
.
*NL*
And
yet
,
madam
,
I
am
afraid
you
have
more
than
this
sin
to
answer
*NL*
for
.
''
``
During
his
life
,
''
answered
she
,
``
which
was
above
a
dozen
years
,
*NL*
I
most
solemnly
assure
you
I
had
not
.
And
consider
,
sir
,
on
my
behalf
,
*NL*
what
is
in
the
power
of
a
woman
stript
of
her
reputation
and
left
*NL*
destitute
;
whether
the
good-natured
world
will
suffer
such
a
stray
*NL*
sheep
to
return
to
the
road
of
virtue
,
even
if
she
was
never
so
*NL*
desirous
.
I
protest
,
then
,
I
would
have
chose
it
had
it
been
in
my
*NL*
power
;
but
necessity
drove
me
into
the
arms
of
Captain
Waters
,
with
*NL*
whom
,
though
still
unmarried
,
I
lived
as
a
wife
for
many
years
,
and
*NL*
went
by
his
name
.
I
parted
with
this
gentleman
at
Worcester
,
on
his
*NL*
march
against
the
rebels
,
and
it
was
then
I
accidentally
met
with
Mr
*NL*
Jones
,
who
rescued
me
from
the
hands
of
a
villain
.
Indeed
,
he
is
the
*NL*
worthiest
of
men
.
No
young
gentleman
of
his
age
is
,
I
believe
,
freer
*NL*
from
vice
,
and
few
have
the
twentieth
part
of
his
virtues
;
nay
,
*NL*
whatever
vices
he
hath
had
,
I
am
firmly
persuaded
he
hath
now
taken
a
*NL*
resolution
to
abandon
them
.
''
``
I
hope
he
hath
,
''
cries
Allworthy
,
``
and
I
*NL*
hope
he
will
preserve
that
resolution
.
I
must
say
,
I
have
still
the
*NL*
same
hopes
with
regard
to
yourself
.
The
world
,
I
do
agree
,
are
apt
to
*NL*
be
too
unmerciful
on
these
occasions
;
yet
time
and
perseverance
will
*NL*
get
the
better
of
this
their
disinclination
,
as
I
may
call
it
,
to
*NL*
pity
;
for
though
they
are
not
,
like
heaven
,
ready
to
receive
a
*NL*
penitent
sinner
;
yet
a
continued
repentance
will
at
length
obtain
*NL*
mercy
even
with
the
world
.
This
you
may
be
assured
of
,
Mrs
Waters
,
*NL*
that
whenever
I
find
you
are
sincere
in
such
good
intentions
,
you
*NL*
shall
want
no
assistance
in
my
power
to
make
them
effectual
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
fell
now
upon
her
knees
before
him
,
and
,
in
a
flood
of
*NL*
tears
,
made
him
many
most
passionate
acknowledgments
of
his
goodness
,
*NL*
which
,
as
she
truly
said
,
savoured
more
of
the
divine
than
human
*NL*
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
raised
her
up
,
and
spoke
in
the
most
tender
manner
,
making
*NL*
use
of
every
expression
which
his
invention
could
suggest
to
comfort
*NL*
her
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
Mr
Dowling
,
who
,
upon
*NL*
his
first
entrance
,
seeing
Mrs
Waters
,
started
,
and
appeared
in
some
*NL*
confusion
;
from
which
he
soon
recovered
himself
as
well
as
he
could
,
*NL*
and
then
said
he
was
in
the
utmost
haste
to
attend
counsel
at
Mr
*NL*
Western
's
lodgings
;
but
,
however
,
thought
it
his
duty
to
call
and
*NL*
acquaint
him
with
the
opinion
of
counsel
upon
the
case
which
he
had
*NL*
before
told
him
,
which
was
that
the
conversion
of
the
moneys
in
that
*NL*
case
could
not
be
questioned
in
a
criminal
cause
,
but
that
an
action
*NL*
of
trover
might
be
brought
,
and
if
it
appeared
to
the
jury
to
be
the
*NL*
moneys
of
plaintiff
,
that
plaintiff
would
recover
a
verdict
for
the
*NL*
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
,
without
making
any
answer
to
this
,
bolted
the
door
,
and
*NL*
then
,
advancing
with
a
stern
look
to
Dowling
,
he
said
,
``
Whatever
be
*NL*
your
haste

I
must
first
receive
an

you
know

--
``
That

answered
Dowling
,
with
great
*NL*
hesitation
.
Allworthy
then
,
with
the
most
solemn
voice
,
said
,
``

Yes

Dowling

At

you
go
thither

you

He
told

said
Mrs
Waters
,
``
that

had
murdered
my

I

should
be
assisted

carry
on
the
prosecution

by
a
very
worthy
gentleman

who
was
well
apprized
what
a
villain
I
had
*NL*
to
deal
with

These
,
I
can
safely

were
the
very
words

spoke

Dowling

did
Mr

order
you
to
say
so
?

``
I
am
sure

should
not
have
gone
on

willingly
exceeded
my

matters

must
have
so
*NL*
understood
Mr

``
Look
you

Mr
Dowling

said
*NL*
Allworthy
;

order
I
will
forgive

provided
you
*NL*
now
tell
me
strictly
the

I
believe

you

that
you

not
have
acted
of
your
own
accord

without
authority
in
this

Mr

then
likewise
sent
you

at
Aldersgate

Why

sir

Mr

sent
me
to

find
out
the
persons

fight

He
said
,
he
*NL*
feared
they
might
be
tampered
with
by
Mr
Jones
,
or
some
of
his
*NL*
friends

He
said

blood
required
blood

that
not

all
who
*NL*
concealed
a
murderer
,
but
those
who
omitted
anything
in
their
power
to
*NL*
bring
him
to
justice
,
were
sharers
in
his
guilt
.
He
said
,
he
found
you

was
very
desirous
of
having
the
villain
brought
to
justice

it
*NL*
was
not
proper
you
should
appear
in
it

He
did
so
?

says
*NL*
Allworthy
.

``
Yes
,
sir
,

cries
Dowling
;

I
should
not

am
sure

proceeded
such
lengths
for
the
sake
of
any
other

living
but
*NL*
your
worship

What
lengths

Allworthy

Nay

I

not
have
your

think
I
would
,
on
any
*NL*
account
,
be
guilty
of
subornation
of
perjury
;
but
there
are
two
ways
*NL*
of
delivering
evidence
.
I
told
them
,
therefore
,
that
if
any
offers
*NL*
should
be
made
them
on
the
other
side
,
they
should
refuse
them

*NL*
that
they
might
be
assured
they
should
lose
nothing
by
being
honest
*NL*
men
,

telling
the
truth

I
said
,
we
were
told
that
Mr
Jones
had
*NL*
assaulted
the
gentleman
first
,
and
that
,
if
that
was
the
truth
,
they
*NL*
should
declare
it
;

I
did
give
them
some
hints
that
they
should
be
*NL*
no
losers

I
think
you
went
lengths
indeed

Nay

Dowling

``
I
am
sure
I
did
not
desire

tell
an
untruth

Allworthy

shall
do

Indeed
,
sir
,
I
did
know
it
;
for
they
were
almost
*NL*
the
last
words
which
Madam
Blifil
ever
spoke
,
which
she
mentioned
to
*NL*
me
as
I
stood
alone
by
her
bedside
,
when
she
delivered
me
the
letter
I
*NL*
brought
your

from
her
.

``
What
letter
?
''
cries
Allworthy
.

``
The
*NL*
letter

answered
Dowling
,
``
which
I
brought
from
Salisbury
,
and
*NL*
which
I
delivered
into
the
hands
of
Mr

``
O
heavens
!
''
cries
*NL*
Allworthy
:
``
Well
,
and
what
were
the
words

What
did
my
sister
say
to

She
took
me
by

he

says
she

then
fell
backward
,
as
if
dying
away

I
presently
called
in
the
*NL*
people

she
never
spoke
more
to
me

died
within
a
few
minutes
*NL*
afterwards

--
Allworthy
stood
a
minute
silent
,
lifting
up
his
eyes
;
*NL*
and
then
,
turning
to
Dowling
,
said
,
``
How
came
you
,
sir
,
not
to
deliver
*NL*
me
this
message
?
''
``
Your
worship

''
answered
he
,
``
must
remember
that
you
*NL*
was
at
that
time
ill
in
bed
;
and
,
being
in
a
violent
hurry
,
as
indeed
*NL*
I
always
am
,
I
delivered
the
letter
and
message
to
Mr
Blifil
,
who
told
*NL*
me
he
would
carry
them
both
to
you
,
which
he
hath
since
told
me
he
*NL*
did
,
and
that
your
worship
,
partly
out
of
friendship
to
Mr
Jones
,
and
*NL*
partly
out
of
regard
to
your
sister
,
would
never
have
it
mentioned
,
*NL*

did
intend
to
conceal
it
from
the
world
;
and
therefore
,
sir
,
if
*NL*
you
had
not
mentioned
it
to
me
first
,
I
am
certain
I
should
never
have
*NL*
thought
it
belonged
to
me
to
say
anything
of
the
matter
,
either
to
*NL*
your
worship
or
any
other
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
remarked
somewhere
already
,
that
it
is
possible
for
a
man
to
*NL*
convey
a
lie
in
the
words
of
truth
;
this
was
the
case
at
present
;
for
*NL*
Blifil
had
,
in
fact
,
told
Dowling
what
he
now
related
,
but
had
not
*NL*
imposed
upon
him
,
nor
indeed
had
imagined
he
was
able
so
to
do
.
In
*NL*
reality
,
the
promises
which
Blifil
had
made
to
Dowling
were
the
*NL*
motives
which
had
induced
him
to
secrecy
;
and
,
as
he
now
very
plainly
*NL*
saw
Blifil
would
not
be
able
to
keep
them
,
he
thought
proper
now
to
*NL*
make
this
confession
,
which
the
promises
of
forgiveness
,
joined
to
the
*NL*
threats
,
the
voice
,
the
looks
of
Allworthy
,
and
the
discoveries
he
had
*NL*
made
before
,
extorted
from
him
,
who
was
besides
taken
unawares
,
and
*NL*
had
no
time
to
consider
of
evasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
appeared
well
satisfied
with
this
relation
,
and
,
having
*NL*
enjoined
on
Dowling
strict
silence
as
to
what
had
past
,
conducted
that
*NL*
gentleman
himself
to
the
door
,
lest
he
should
see
Blifil
,
who
was
*NL*
returned
to
his
chamber
,
where
he
exulted
in
the
thoughts
of
his
last
*NL*
deceit
on
his
uncle
,
and
little
suspected
what
had
since
passed
*NL*
below-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Allworthy
was
returning
to
his
room
he
met
Mrs
Miller
in
the
entry
,
*NL*
who
,
with
a
face
all
pale
and
full
of
terror
,
said
to
him
,
``
O
!
sir
,
I
*NL*
find
this
wicked
woman
hath
been
with
you
,
and
you
know
all
;
yet
do
*NL*
not
on
this
account
abandon
the
poor
young
man
.
Consider
,
sir
,
he
was
*NL*
ignorant
it
was
his
own
mother
;
and
the
discovery
itself
will
most
*NL*
probably
break
his
heart
,
without
your
unkindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam

''
says
Allworthy
,
``
I
am
under
such
an
astonishment
at
what
I
*NL*
have
heard
,
that
I
am
really
unable
to
satisfy
you
;
but
come
with
me
*NL*
into
my
room
.
Indeed
,
Mrs
Miller
,
I
have
made
surprizing
discoveries
,
*NL*
and
you
shall
soon
know
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
woman
followed
him
trembling
;
and
now
Allworthy
,
going
up
to
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
,
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
then
,
turning
to
Mrs
Miller
,
*NL*
said
,
``
What
reward
shall
I
bestow
upon
this
gentlewoman
,
for
the
*NL*
services
she
hath
done
me
?
--
O
!
Mrs
Miller
,
you
have
a
thousand
times
*NL*
heard
me
call
the
young
man
to
whom
you
are
so
faithful
a
friend
,
my
*NL*
son
.
Little
did
I
then
think
he
was
indeed
related
to
me
at
all
.
--
Your
*NL*
friend
,
madam
,
is
my
nephew
;
he
is
the
brother
of
that
wicked
viper
*NL*
which
I
have
so
long
nourished
in
my
bosom
.
--
She
will
herself
tell
you
*NL*
the
whole
story
,
and
how
the
youth
came
to
pass
for
her
son
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
,
I
am
convinced
that
he
hath
been
wronged
,
and
that
I
have
*NL*
been
abused
;
abused
by
one
whom
you
too
justly
suspected
of
being
a
*NL*
villain
.
He
is
,
in
truth
,
the
worst
of
villains
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
joy
which
Mrs
Miller
now
felt
bereft
her
of
the
power
of
speech
,
*NL*
and
might
perhaps
have
deprived
her
of
her
senses
,
if
not
of
life
,
had
*NL*
not
a
friendly
shower
of
tears
come
seasonably
to
her
relief
.
At
*NL*
length
,
recovering
so
far
from
her
transport
as
to
be
able
to
speak
,
*NL*
she
cried
,
``
And
is
my
dear
Mr
Jones
then
your
nephew
,
sir
,
and
not
the
*NL*
son
of
this
lady
?
And
are
your
eyes
opened
to
him
at
last
?
And
shall
I
*NL*
live
to
see
him
as
happy
as
he
deserves
?
''
``
He
certainly
is
my
nephew
,
''
*NL*
says
Allworthy
,
``
and
I
hope
all
the
rest
.
''
--
``
And
is
this
the
dear
good
*NL*
woman
,
the
person
,
''
cries
she
,
``
to
whom
all
this
discovery
is
*NL*
owing
?
''
--
``
She
is
indeed
,
''
says
Allworthy
.
--
``
Why
,
then
,
''
cried
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
,
upon
her
knees
,
``
may
Heaven
shower
down
its
choicest
blessings
*NL*
upon
her
head
,
and
for
this
one
good
action
forgive
her
all
her
sins
,
*NL*
be
they
never
so
many
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Waters
then
informed
them
that
she
believed
Jones
would
very
*NL*
shortly
be
released
;
for
that
the
surgeon
was
gone
,
in
company
with
a
*NL*
nobleman
,
to
the
justice
who
committed
him
,
in
order
to
certify
that
*NL*
Mr
Fitzpatrick
was
out
of
all
manner
of
danger
,
and
to
procure
his
*NL*
prisoner
his
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
said
he
should
be
glad
to
find
his
nephew
there
at
his
*NL*
return
home
;
but
that
he
was
then
obliged
to
go
on
some
business
of
*NL*
consequence
.
He
then
called
to
a
servant
to
fetch
him
a
chair
,
and
*NL*
presently
left
the
two
ladies
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Blifil
,
hearing
the
chair
ordered
,
came
downstairs
to
attend
upon
*NL*
his
uncle
;
for
he
never
was
deficient
in
such
acts
of
duty
.
He
asked
*NL*
his
uncle
if
he
was
going
out
,
which
is
a
civil
way
of
asking
a
man
*NL*
whither
he
is
going
:
to
which
the
other
making
no
answer
,
he
again
*NL*
desired
to
know
when
he
would
be
pleased
to
return
?
--
Allworthy
made
no
*NL*
answer
to
this
neither
,
till
he
was
just
going
into
his
chair
,
and
*NL*
then
,
turning
about
,
he
said
--
``
Harkee
,
sir
,
do
you
find
out
,
before
my
*NL*
return
,
the
letter
which
your
mother
sent
me
on
her
death-bed
.
''
*NL*
Allworthy
then
departed
,
and
left
Blifil
in
a
situation
to
be
envied
*NL*
only
by
a
man
who
is
just
going
to
be
hanged
.

*NL*
A
further
continuation
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
took
an
opportunity
,
whilst
he
was
in
the
chair
,
of
reading
*NL*
the
letter
from
Jones
to
Sophia
,
which
Western
delivered
him
;
and
*NL*
there
were
some
expressions
in
it
concerning
himself
which
drew
tears
*NL*
from
his
eyes
.
At
length
he
arrived
at
Mr
Western
's
,
and
was
*NL*
introduced
to
Sophia
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
first
ceremonies
were
past
,
and
the
gentleman
and
lady
had
*NL*
taken
their
chairs
,
a
silence
of
some
minutes
ensued
;
during
which
the
*NL*
latter
,
who
had
been
prepared
for
the
visit
by
her
father
,
sat
playing
*NL*
with
her
fan
,
and
had
every
mark
of
confusion
both
in
her
countenance
*NL*
and
behaviour
.
At
length
Allworthy
,
who
was
himself
a
little
*NL*
disconcerted
,
began
thus
:
``
I
am
afraid
,
Miss
Western
,
my
family
hath
*NL*
been
the
occasion
of
giving
you
some
uneasiness
;
to
which
,
I
fear
,
I
*NL*
have
innocently
become
more
instrumental
than
I
intended
.
Be
assured
,
*NL*
madam
,
had
I
at
first
known
how
disagreeable
the
proposals
had
been
,
I
*NL*
should
not
have
suffered
you
to
have
been
so
long
persecuted
.
I
hope
,
*NL*
therefore
,
you
will
not
think
the
design
of
this
visit
is
to
trouble
*NL*
you
with
any
further
solicitations
of
that
kind
,
but
entirely
to
*NL*
relieve
you
from
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Sophia
,
with
a
little
modest
hesitation
,
``
this
behaviour
*NL*
is
most
kind
and
generous
,
and
such
as
I
could
expect
only
from
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
;
but
as
you
have
been
so
kind
to
mention
this
matter
,
you
*NL*
will
pardon
me
for
saying
it
hath
,
indeed
,
given
me
great
uneasiness
,
*NL*
and
hath
been
the
occasion
of
my
suffering
much
cruel
treatment
from
*NL*
a
father
who
was
,
till
that
unhappy
affair
,
the
tenderest
and
fondest
*NL*
of
all
parents
.
I
am
convinced
,
sir
,
you
are
too
good
and
generous
to
*NL*
resent
my
refusal
of
your
nephew
.
Our
inclinations
are
not
in
our
own
*NL*
power
;
and
whatever
may
be
his
merit
,
I
can
not
force
them
in
his
*NL*
favour
.
''
``
I
assure
you
,
most
amiable
young
lady
,
''
said
Allworthy
,
``
I
*NL*
am
capable
of
no
such
resentment
,
had
the
person
been
my
own
son
,
and
*NL*
had
I
entertained
the
highest
esteem
for
him
.
For
you
say
truly
,
*NL*
madam
,
we
can
not
force
our
inclinations
,
much
less
can
they
be
*NL*
directed
by
another
.
''
``
Oh
!
sir
,
''
answered
Sophia
,
``
every
word
you
*NL*
speak
proves
you
deserve
that
good
,
that
great
,
that
benevolent
*NL*
character
the
whole
world
allows
you
.
I
assure
you
,
sir
,
nothing
less
*NL*
than
the
certain
prospect
of
future
misery
could
have
made
me
resist
*NL*
the
commands
of
my
father
.
''
``
I
sincerely
believe
you
,
madam
,
''
replied
*NL*
Allworthy
,
``
and
I
heartily
congratulate
you
on
your
prudent
*NL*
foresight
,
since
by
so
justifiable
a
resistance
you
have
avoided
*NL*
misery
indeed
!
''
``
You
speak
now
,
Mr
Allworthy
,
''
cries
she
,
``
with
a
*NL*
delicacy
which
few
men
are
capable
of
feeling
!
but
surely
,
in
my
*NL*
opinion
,
to
lead
our
lives
with
one
to
whom
we
are
indifferent
must
*NL*
be
a
state
of
wretchedness
.
--
Perhaps
that
wretchedness
would
be
*NL*
even
increased
by
a
sense
of
the
merits
of
an
object
to
whom
we
*NL*
can
not
give
our
affections
.
If
I
had
married
Mr
Blifil
--
''
``
Pardon
my
*NL*
interrupting
you
,
madam
,
''
answered
Allworthy
,
``
but
I
can
not
bear
the
*NL*
supposition

--
Believe
me
,
Miss
Western
,
I
rejoice
from
my
heart
,
I
*NL*
rejoice
in
your
escape
.

I
have
discovered
the
wretch
for
whom
you
*NL*
have
suffered
all
this
cruel
violence
from
your
father
to
be
a
*NL*
villain

``
How
,
sir
!

cries
Sophia
--
``
you
must
believe
this
surprizes
*NL*
me

``
It
hath
surprized
me

answered
Allworthy
,
``
and
so
it
*NL*
will
the
world
.

But
I
have
acquainted
you
with
the
real
truth

*NL*
``
Nothing
but
truth

says
Sophia
,
``
can

I
am
convinced

come
from
the

lips

Yet

You
will
*NL*
soon
enough
hear
the
story

cries
Allworthy
;

``
at
present
let
us
not
*NL*
mention
so
detested
a
name

I
have
another
matter
of
a
very
serious
*NL*
nature
to
propose
.

O
!
Miss
Western
,
I
know
your
vast
worth

nor
can
*NL*
I
so
easily
part
with
the
ambition
of
being
allied
to
it

I
have
a
*NL*
near
relation

madam

a
young
man
whose
character
is
,
I
am
convinced
,
*NL*
the
very
opposite
to
that
of
this
wretch

whose
fortune
I
will
*NL*
make
equal
to
what
his
was
to
have
been

Could
I
,
madam
,
hope
you
*NL*
would
admit
a
visit
from
him
?

Sophia
,
after
a
minute
's
silence
,
*NL*
answered
,
``
I
will
deal
with
the
utmost
sincerity
with

*NL*
His
character

and
the
obligation
I
have
just
received
from
him
,
*NL*
demand
it
.
I
have
determined
at
present
to
listen
to
no
such
*NL*
proposals
from
any
person
.
My
only
desire
is
to
be
restored
to
the
*NL*
affection

my
father

to
be
again
the
mistress

This

all
the
goodness

not

the
very
moment

have
released

me
from
one
persecution

not
engage
me
in
another

miserable

fruitless

``
Indeed

Western

Allworthy

I
am
*NL*
capable

no
such
conduct

submit
to
the
disappointment

whatever
torments
he
may
suffer
under

it

``
I
must
smile
now

Sophia

mention

Pardon

I
begin
now

Allworthy

only
the
circumstance

*NL*
always
own

ashamed

I
am
much
more
*NL*
ashamed
of
my
past
behaviour

I
was
as
ignorant

merit

I
have
used
him

cruelly

Here
the
good
man
wiped
his
eyes

after
a
short
pause
proceeded

amiable
young

I
must
have

been
guilty

faults

is
great
goodness

Here
he
stopped
,
seeming
to
expect
an
answer
,
which
he
presently
*NL*
received
from
Sophia
,
after
she
had
a
little
recovered
herself
from
*NL*
the
hurry
of
spirits
into
which
so
strange
and
sudden
information
had
*NL*
thrown
her
:
``
I
sincerely
wish
you
joy

of
a
discovery

such
satisfaction

I
doubt
not

you
will
have
all
*NL*
the
comfort
you
can
promise
yourself
from
it

The
young
gentleman
*NL*
hath
certainly
a
thousand
good
qualities

which
makes
it
impossible
*NL*
he
should
not
behave
well

such
an
uncle

hath
those
good

be

condescend

young
man
hath
done
nothing
to
forfeit
your
good
opinion
,
if
*NL*
he
had
ever
the
honour
to
enjoy
it
.
--
Perhaps
,
he
may
have
been
*NL*
misrepresented
to
you
,
as
he
was
to
me
.
The
same
villany
may
have
*NL*
injured
him
everywhere
.
--
He
is
no
murderer
,
I
assure
you
;
as
he
hath
*NL*
been
called
.
''
--
``
Mr
Allworthy
,
''
answered
Sophia
,
``
I
have
told
you
my
*NL*
resolution
.
I
wonder
not
at
what
my
father
hath
told
you
;
but
,
*NL*
whatever
his
apprehensions
or
fears
have
been
,
if
I
know
my
heart
,
I
*NL*
have
given
no
occasion
for
them
;
since
it
hath
always
been
a
fixed
*NL*
principle
with
me
,
never
to
have
married
without
his
consent
.
This
*NL*
is
,
I
think
,
the
duty
of
a
child
to
a
parent
;
and
this
,
I
hope
,
*NL*
nothing
could
ever
have
prevailed
with
me
to
swerve
from
.
I
do
not
*NL*
indeed
conceive
that
the
authority
of
any
parent
can
oblige
us
to
*NL*
marry
in
direct
opposition
to
our
inclinations
.
To
avoid
a
force
of
*NL*
this
kind
,
which
I
had
reason
to
suspect
,
I
left
my
father
's
house
,
*NL*
and
sought
protection
elsewhere
.
This
is
the
truth
of
my
story
;
and
*NL*
if
the
world
,
or
my
father
,
carry
my
intentions
any
farther
,
my
own
*NL*
conscience
will
acquit
me
.
''
``
I
hear
you
,
Miss
Western
,
''
cries
*NL*
Allworthy
,
``
with
admiration
.
I
admire
the
justness
of
your
*NL*
sentiments
;
but
surely
there
is
more
in
this
.
I
am
cautious
of
*NL*
offending
you
,
young
lady
;
but
am
I
to
look
on
all
which
I
have
*NL*
hitherto
heard
or
seen
as
a
dream
only
?
And
have
you
suffered
so
much
*NL*
cruelty
from
your
father
on
the
account
of
a
man
to
whom
you
have
*NL*
been
always
absolutely
indifferent
?
''
``
I
beg
,
Mr
Allworthy

''
answered
*NL*
Sophia
,
``
you
will
not
insist
on
my
reasons
;
--
yes
,
I
have
suffered
*NL*
indeed
;
I
will
not
,
Mr
Allworthy
,
conceal
--
I
will
be
very
sincere
*NL*
with
you
--
I
own
I
had
a
great
opinion
of
Mr
Jones
--
I
believe

I
know
*NL*
I
have
suffered
for
my
opinion
--
I
have
been
treated
cruelly
by
my
*NL*
aunt
,
as
well
as
by
my
father
;
but
that
is
now
past
--
I
beg
I
may
not
*NL*
be
farther
pressed
;
for
,
whatever
hath
been
,
my
resolution
is
now
*NL*
fixed

Your
nephew
,
sir
,
hath
many
virtues
--
he
hath
great
virtues
,
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy

I
question
not

he
will
do
you
honour
in
the
world

*NL*
make
you
happy

''
--
``
I
wish
I
could
make
him
so
,
madam
,
''
replied
*NL*
Allworthy
;
``
but
that
I
am
convinced
is
only
in
your
power
.
It
is
that
*NL*
conviction
which
hath
made
me
so
earnest
a
solicitor
in
his
favour
.
''
*NL*
``
You
are
deceived
indeed
,
sir
;
you
are
deceived

''
said
Sophia
.
``
I
*NL*
hope
not

It
is
sufficient
to
have
deceived
me

Mr
Allworthy
,
*NL*
I
must
insist
on
being
pressed
no
farther
on
this
subject

I
should
*NL*
be
sorry

nay

I
will
not
injure
him
in
your
favour

I
wish
Mr
Jones

very
well

I
sincerely
wish
him
well
;
and
I
repeat
it
again
to
you
,
*NL*
whatever
demerit
he
may
have
to
me
,
I
am
certain
he
hath
many
good
*NL*
qualities
.
I
do
not
disown
my
former
thoughts
;
but
nothing
can
ever
*NL*
recal
them
.
At
present
there
is
not
a
man
upon
earth
whom
I
would
*NL*
more
resolutely
reject
than
Mr
Jones
;
nor
would
the
addresses
of
Mr
*NL*
Blifil
himself
be
less
agreeable
to
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Western
had
been
long
impatient
for
the
event
of
this
conference
,
and
*NL*
was
just
now
arrived
at
the
door
to
listen
;
when
,
having
heard
the
*NL*
last
sentiments
of
his
daughter
's
heart
,
he
lost
all
temper
,
and
,
*NL*
bursting
open
the
door
in
a
rage
,
cried
out
--
``
It
is
a
lie
!
It
is
a
*NL*
d

It
is
all
owing

rascal
Jones

get
at
un
,
she
'd
ha

any
hour
of
the
day

''
Here
Allworthy
*NL*
interposed
,
and
addressing
himself
to
the
squire
with
some
anger
in
*NL*
his
look
,
he
said
,
``
Mr
Western
,
you
have
not
kept
your
word
with
me

*NL*
You
promised
to
abstain
from
all

--
``
Why
,
so
I
did
,
''
cries
*NL*
Western
,
``
as
long
as
it
was
possible
;

to
hear
a
wench
telling
such

confounded

doth
she
think

can
make

No

thee

''
``
I
am
sorry
to
tell
you
,

answered
Allworthy
,
``
it
*NL*
doth
not
appear

by
your
behaviour

this
young

ask
pardon
for
what
I
say

I
think

the

the

``
You

Allworthy
,
``

the

said
Allworthy
,
``
indeed

I
can
not

bear
to

this

She
deserves

``
Yes

said
the
*NL*
squire
,
``
I
know
what

now

gone

I
'll
shew

See
here
,
sir
,
here
is
a
letter
from
my
cousin
,
my
Lady
*NL*
Bellaston
,
in
which
she
is
so
kind
to
gi
'
me
to
understand
that
the
*NL*
fellow
is
got
out
of
prison
again
;
and
here
she
advises
me
to
take
all
*NL*
the
care
I
can
o
'
the
wench
.
Odzookers
!
neighbour
Allworthy
,
you
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
it
is
to
govern
a
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
ended
his
speech
with
some
compliments
to
his
own
sagacity
;
*NL*
and
then
Allworthy
,
after
a
formal
preface
,
acquainted
him
with
the
*NL*
whole
discovery
which
he
had
made
concerning
Jones
,
with
his
anger
to
*NL*
Blifil
,
and
with
every
particular
which
hath
been
disclosed
to
the
*NL*
reader
in
the
preceding
chapters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
over-violent
in
their
dispositions
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
as
*NL*
changeable
in
them
.
No
sooner
then
was
Western
informed
of
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
's
intention
to
make
Jones
his
heir
,
than
he
joined
heartily
*NL*
with
the
uncle
in
every
commendation
of
the
nephew
,
and
became
as
*NL*
eager
for
her
marriage
with
Jones
as
he
had
before
been
to
couple
her
*NL*
to
Blifil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Mr
Allworthy
was
again
forced
to
interpose
,
and
to
relate
what
*NL*
had
passed
between
him
and
Sophia
,
at
which
he
testified
great
*NL*
surprize
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
was
silent
a
moment
,
and
looked
wild
with
astonishment
at
*NL*
this
account
.
--
At
last
he
cried
out
,
``
Why
,
what
can
be
the
meaning
of
*NL*
this
,
neighbour
Allworthy
?
Vond
o'un
she
was
,
that
I
'll
be
sworn
*NL*
to

--
Odzookers
!
I
have
hit
o

As
sure
as
a
gun
I
have
hit
o

the
*NL*
very
right
o
`
t.
It
's
all
along
o
'
zister
.
The
girl
hath
got
a
*NL*
hankering
after
this
son
of
a
whore
of
a
lord
.
I
vound
'em
together
at
*NL*
my
cousin
my
Lady
Bellaston
's
.
He
hath
turned
the
head
o
'
her
,
that
's
*NL*
certain
--
but
d
--
n
me
if
he
shall
ha
her
--
I
'll
ha
no
lords
nor
*NL*
courtiers
in
my
vamily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
now
made
a
long
speech
,
in
which
he
repeated
his
resolution
*NL*
to
avoid
all
violent
measures
,
and
very
earnestly
recommended
gentle
*NL*
methods
to
Mr
Western
,
as
those
by
which
he
might
be
assured
of
*NL*
succeeding
best
with
his
daughter
.
He
then
took
his
leave
,
and
*NL*
returned
back
to
Mrs
Miller
,
but
was
forced
to
comply
with
the
earnest
*NL*
entreaties
of
the
squire
,
in
promising
to
bring
Mr
Jones
to
visit
him
*NL*
that
afternoon
,
that
he
might
,
as
he
said
,
``
make
all
matters
up
with
*NL*
the
young
gentleman
.
''
At
Mr
Allworthy
's
departure
,
Western
promised
to
*NL*
follow
his
advice
in
his
behaviour
to
Sophia
,
saying
,
``
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
't
is
,
but
d

n
me
,
Allworthy
,
if
you
do
n't
make
me
always
do
just
*NL*
as
you
please
;
and
yet
I
have
as
good
an
estate
as
you
,
and
am
in
the
*NL*
commission
of
the
peace
as
well
as
yourself

*NL*
Chapter
x.
*NL*
*NL*
Wherein
the
history
begins
to
draw
towards
a
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Allworthy
returned
to
his
lodgings
,
he
heard
Mr
Jones
was
just
*NL*
arrived
before
him
.
He
hurried
therefore
instantly
into
an
empty
*NL*
chamber
,
whither
he
ordered
Mr
Jones
to
be
brought
to
him
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
impossible
to
conceive
a
more
tender
or
moving
scene
than
the
*NL*
meeting
between
the
uncle
and
nephew
-LRB-
for
Mrs
Waters
,
as
the
reader
*NL*
may
well
suppose
,
had
at
her
last
visit
discovered
to
him
the
secret
*NL*
of
his
birth
-RRB-
.
The
first
agonies
of
joy
which
were
felt
on
both
sides
*NL*
are
indeed
beyond
my
power
to
describe
:
I
shall
not
therefore
attempt
*NL*
it
.
After
Allworthy
had
raised
Jones
from
his
feet
,
where
he
had
*NL*
prostrated
himself
,
and
received
him
into
his
arms
,
``
O
my
child
!
''
he
*NL*
cried
,
``
how
have
I
been
to
blame
!
how
have
I
injured
you
!
What
amends
*NL*
can
I
ever
make
you
for
those
unkind
,
those
unjust
suspicions
which
I
*NL*
have
entertained
,
and
for
all
the
sufferings
they
have
occasioned
to
*NL*
you
?
''
``
Am
I
not
now
made
amends
?
''
cries
Jones
.
``
Would
not
my
*NL*
sufferings
,
if
they
had
been
ten
times
greater
,
have
been
now
richly
*NL*
repaid
?
O
my
dear
uncle
,
this
goodness
,
this
tenderness
overpowers
,
*NL*
unmans
,
destroys
me
.
I
can
not
bear
the
transports
which
flow
so
fast
*NL*
upon
me
.
To
be
again
restored
to
your
presence
,
to
your
favour
;
to
be
*NL*
once
more
thus
kindly
received
by
my
great
,
my
noble
,
my
generous
*NL*
benefactor
.
''
--
``
Indeed
,
child
,
''
cries
Allworthy
,
``
I
have
used
you
*NL*
cruelly
.
''
--
He
then
explained
to
him
all
the
treachery
of
Blifil
,
and
*NL*
again
repeated
expressions
of
the
utmost
concern
,
for
having
been
*NL*
induced
by
that
treachery
to
use
him
so
ill
.
``
O
,
talk
not
so
!
''
*NL*
answered
Jones
;
``
indeed
,
sir
,
you
have
used
me
nobly
.
The
wisest
man
*NL*
might
be
deceived
as
you
were
;
and
,
under
such
a
deception
,
the
best
*NL*
must
have
acted
just
as
you
did
.
Your
goodness
displayed
itself
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
your
anger
,
just
as
it
then
seemed
.
I
owe
everything
to
that
*NL*
goodness
,
of
which
I
have
been
most
unworthy
.
Do
not
put
me
on
*NL*
self-accusation
,
by
carrying
your
generous
sentiments
too
far
.
Alas
!
*NL*
sir
,
I
have
not
been
punished
more
than
I
have
deserved
;
and
it
shall
*NL*
be
the
whole
business
of
my
future
life
to
deserve
that
happiness
you
*NL*
now
bestow
on
me
;
for
,
believe
me
,
my
dear
uncle
,
my
punishment
hath
*NL*
not
been
thrown
away
upon
me
:
though
I
have
been
a
great
,
I
am
not
a
*NL*
hardened
sinner
;
I
thank
Heaven
,
I
have
had
time
to
reflect
on
my
past
*NL*
life
,
where
,
though
I
can
not
charge
myself
with
any
gross
villany
,
yet
*NL*
I
can
discern
follies
and
vices
more
than
enough
to
repent
and
to
be
*NL*
ashamed
of
;
follies
which
have
been
attended
with
dreadful
*NL*
consequences
to
myself
,
and
have
brought
me
to
the
brink
of
*NL*
destruction
.
''
``
I
am
rejoiced
,
my
dear
child
,
''
answered
Allworthy
,
``
to
*NL*
hear
you
talk
thus
sensibly
;
for
as
I
am
convinced
hypocrisy
-LRB-
good
*NL*
Heaven
!
how
have
I
been
imposed
on
by
it
in
others
!
-RRB-
was
never
among
*NL*
your
faults
,
so
I
can
readily
believe
all
you
say
.
You
now
see
,
Tom
,
*NL*
to
what
dangers
imprudence
alone
may
subject
virtue
-LRB-
for
virtue
,
I
am
*NL*
now
convinced
,
you
love
in
a
great
degree
-RRB-
.
Prudence
is
indeed
the
*NL*
duty
which
we
owe
to
ourselves
;
and
if
we
will
be
so
much
our
own
*NL*
enemies
as
to
neglect
it
,
we
are
not
to
wonder
if
the
world
is
*NL*
deficient
in
discharging
their
duty
to
us
;
for
when
a
man
lays
the
*NL*
foundation
of
his
own
ruin
,
others
will
,
I
am
afraid
,
be
too
apt
to
*NL*
build
upon
it
.
You
say
,
however
,
you
have
seen
your
errors
,
and
will
*NL*
reform
them
.
I
firmly
believe
you
,
my
dear
child
;
and
therefore
,
from
*NL*
this
moment
,
you
shall
never
be
reminded
of
them
by
me
.
Remember
them
*NL*
only
yourself
so
far
as
for
the
future
to
teach
you
the
better
to
*NL*
avoid
them
;
but
still
remember
,
for
your
comfort
,
that
there
is
this
*NL*
great
difference
between
those
faults
which
candor
may
construe
into
*NL*
imprudence
,
and
those
which
can
be
deduced
from
villany
only
.
The
*NL*
former
,
perhaps
,
are
even
more
apt
to
subject
a
man
to
ruin
;
but
if
he
*NL*
reform
,
his
character
will
,
at
length
,
be
totally
retrieved
;
the
*NL*
world
,
though
not
immediately
,
will
in
time
be
reconciled
to
him
;
and
*NL*
he
may
reflect
,
not
without
some
mixture
of
pleasure
,
on
the
dangers
*NL*
he
hath
escaped
;
but
villany
,
my
boy
,
when
once
discovered
is
*NL*
irretrievable
;
the
stains
which
this
leaves
behind
,
no
time
will
wash
*NL*
away
.
The
censures
of
mankind
will
pursue
the
wretch
,
their
scorn
will
*NL*
abash
him
in
publick
;
and
if
shame
drives
him
into
retirement
,
he
will
*NL*
go
to
it
with
all
those
terrors
with
which
a
weary
child
,
who
is
*NL*
afraid
of
hobgoblins
,
retreats
from
company
to
go
to
bed
alone
.
Here
*NL*
his
murdered
conscience
will
haunt
him
.
--
Repose
,
like
a
false
friend
,
*NL*
will
fly
from
him
.
Wherever
he
turns
his
eyes
,
horror
presents
itself
;
*NL*
if
he
looks
backward
,
unavailable
repentance
treads
on
his
heels
;
if
*NL*
forward
,
incurable
despair
stares
him
in
the
face
,
till
,
like
a
*NL*
condemned
prisoner
confined
in
a
dungeon
,
he
detests
his
present
*NL*
condition
,
and
yet
dreads
the
consequence
of
that
hour
which
is
to
*NL*
relieve
him
from
it
.
Comfort
yourself
,
I
say
,
my
child
,
that
this
is
*NL*
not
your
case
;
and
rejoice
with
thankfulness
to
him
who
hath
suffered
*NL*
you
to
see
your
errors
,
before
they
have
brought
on
you
that
*NL*
destruction
to
which
a
persistance
in
even
those
errors
must
have
led
*NL*
you
.
You
have
deserted
them
;
and
the
prospect
now
before
you
is
such
,
*NL*
that
happiness
seems
in
your
own
power
.
''
At
these
words
Jones
fetched
*NL*
a
deep
sigh
;
upon
which
,
when
Allworthy
remonstrated
,
he
said
,
``
Sir
,
I
*NL*
will
conceal
nothing
from
you
:
I
fear
there
is
one
consequence
of
my
*NL*
vices
I
shall
never
be
able
to
retrieve
.
O
,
my
dear
uncle
!
I
have
lost
*NL*
a
treasure
.
''
``
You
need
say
no
more
,
''
answered
Allworthy
;
``
I
will
be
*NL*
explicit
with
you
;
I
know
what
you
lament
;
I
have
seen
the
young
lady
,
*NL*
and
have
discoursed
with
her
concerning
you
.
This
I
must
insist
on
,
as
*NL*
an
earnest
of
your
sincerity
in
all
you
have
said
,
and
of
the
*NL*
stedfastness
of
your
resolution
,
that
you
obey
me
in
one
instance
.
To
*NL*
abide
intirely
by
the
determination
of
the
young
lady
,
whether
it
*NL*
shall
be
in
your
favour
or
no
.
She
hath
already
suffered
enough
from
*NL*
solicitations
which
I
hate
to
think
of
;
she
shall
owe
no
further
*NL*
constraint
to
my
family
:
I
know
her
father
will
be
as
ready
to
torment
*NL*
her
now
on
your
account
as
he
hath
formerly
been
on
another
's
;
but
I
*NL*
am
determined
she
shall
suffer
no
more
confinement
,
no
more
violence
,
*NL*
no
more
uneasy
hours
.
''
``
O
,
my
dear
uncle
!
''
answered
Jones
,
``
lay
,
I
*NL*
beseech
you
,
some
command
on
me
,
in
which
I
shall
have
some
merit
in
*NL*
obedience
.
Believe
me
,
sir
,
the
only
instance
in
which
I
could
disobey
*NL*
you
would
be
to
give
an
uneasy
moment
to
my
Sophia
.
No
,
sir
,
if
I
am
*NL*
so
miserable
to
have
incurred
her
displeasure
beyond
all
hope
of
*NL*
forgiveness
,
that
alone
,
with
the
dreadful
reflection
of
causing
her
*NL*
misery
,
will
be
sufficient
to
overpower
me
.
To
call
Sophia
mine
is
the
*NL*
greatest
,
and
now
the
only
additional
blessing
which
heaven
can
*NL*
bestow
;
but
it
is
a
blessing
which
I
must
owe
to
her
alone
.
''
``
I
will
*NL*
not
flatter
you
,
child
,
''
cries
Allworthy
;
``
I
fear
your
case
is
*NL*
desperate
:
I
never
saw
stronger
marks
of
an
unalterable
resolution
in
*NL*
any
person
than
appeared
in
her
vehement
declarations
against
*NL*
receiving
your
addresses
;
for
which
,
perhaps
,
you
can
account
better
*NL*
than
myself
.
''
``
Oh
,
sir
!
I
can
account
too
well
,
''
answered
Jones
;
``
I
*NL*
have
sinned
against
her
beyond
all
hope
of
pardon
;
and
guilty
as
I
am
,
*NL*
my
guilt
unfortunately
appears
to
her
in
ten
times
blacker
than
the
*NL*
real
colours
.
O
,
my
dear
uncle
!
I
find
my
follies
are
irretrievable
;
*NL*
and
all
your
goodness
can
not
save
me
from
perdition

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
servant
now
acquainted
them
that
Mr
Western
was
below-stairs
;
for
*NL*
his
eagerness
to
see
Jones
could
not
wait
till
the
afternoon
.
Upon
*NL*
which
Jones
,
whose
eyes
were
full
of
tears
,
begged
his
uncle
to
*NL*
entertain
Western
a
few
minutes
,
till
he
a
little
recovered
himself
;
*NL*
to
which
the
good
man
consented
,
and
,
having
ordered
Mr
Western
to
be
*NL*
shewn
into
a
parlour
,
went
down
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
no
sooner
heard
that
Jones
was
alone
-LRB-
for
she
had
not
yet
*NL*
seen
him
since
his
release
from
prison
-RRB-
than
she
came
eagerly
into
the
*NL*
room
,
and
,
advancing
towards
Jones
,
wished
him
heartily
joy
of
his
*NL*
new-found
uncle
and
his
happy
reconciliation
;
adding
,
``
I
wish
I
could
*NL*
give
you
joy
on
another
account
,
my
dear
child
;
but
anything
so
*NL*
inexorable
I
never
saw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
with
some
appearance
of
surprize
,
asked
her
what
she
meant
.
*NL*
``
Why
then
,
''
says
she
,
``
I
have
been
with
your
young
lady
,
and
have
*NL*
explained
all
matters
to
her
,
as
they
were
told
to
me
by
my
son
*NL*
Nightingale
.
She
can
have
no
longer
any
doubt
about
the
letter
;
of
*NL*
that
I
am
certain
;
for
I
told
her
my
son
Nightingale
was
ready
to
take
*NL*
his
oath
,
if
she
pleased
,
that
it
was
all
his
own
invention
,
and
the
*NL*
letter
of
his
inditing
.
I
told
her
the
very
reason
of
sending
the
*NL*
letter
ought
to
recommend
you
to
her
the
more
,
as
it
was
all
upon
her
*NL*
account
,
and
a
plain
proof
that
you
was
resolved
to
quit
all
your
*NL*
profligacy
for
the
future
;
that
you
had
never
been
guilty
of
a
single
*NL*
instance
of
infidelity
to
her
since
your
seeing
her
in
town
:
I
am
*NL*
afraid
I
went
too
far
there
;
but
Heaven
forgive
me
!
I
hope
your
future
*NL*
behaviour
will
be
my
justification
.
I
am
sure
I
have
said
all
I
can
;
*NL*
but
all
to
no
purpose
.
She
remains
inflexible
.
She
says
,
she
had
*NL*
forgiven
many
faults
on
account
of
youth
;
but
expressed
such
*NL*
detestation
of
the
character
of
a
libertine
,
that
she
absolutely
*NL*
silenced
me
.
I
often
attempted
to
excuse
you
;
but
the
justness
of
her
*NL*
accusation
flew
in
my
face
.
Upon
my
honour
,
she
is
a
lovely
woman
,
and
*NL*
one
of
the
sweetest
and
most
sensible
creatures
I
ever
saw
.
I
could
*NL*
have
almost
kissed
her
for
one
expression
she
made
use
of
.
It
was
a
*NL*
sentiment
worthy
of
Seneca
,
or
of
a
bishop
.
`
I
once
fancied
madam
.
'
*NL*
and
she
,
`
I
had
discovered
great
goodness
of
heart
in
Mr
Jones
;
and
*NL*
for
that
I
own
I
had
a
sincere
esteem
;
but
an
entire
profligacy
of
*NL*
manners
will
corrupt
the
best
heart
in
the
world
;
and
all
which
a
*NL*
good-natured
libertine
can
expect
is
,
that
we
should
mix
some
grains
*NL*
of
pity
with
our
contempt
and
abhorrence
.
'
She
is
an
angelic
creature
,
*NL*
that
is
the
truth
o
n't
.
''
``
O
,
Mrs
Miller
!
''
answered
Jones
,
``
can
I
bear
*NL*
to
think
that
I
have
lost
such
an
angel
?
''
``
Lost
!
no
,
''
cries
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
;
``
I
hope
you
have
not
lost
her
yet
.
Resolve
to
leave
such
*NL*
vicious
courses
,
and
you
may
yet
have
hopes
,
nay
,
if
she
would
remain
*NL*
inexorable
,
there
is
another
young
lady
,
a
sweet
pretty
young
lady
,
*NL*
and
a
swinging
fortune
,
who
is
absolutely
dying
for
love
of
you
.
I
*NL*
heard
of
it
this
very
morning
,
and
I
told
it
to
Miss
Western
;
nay
,
I
*NL*
went
a
little
beyond
the
truth
again
;
for
I
told
her
you
had
refused
*NL*
her
;
but
indeed
I
knew
you
would
refuse
her
.
And
here
I
must
give
you
*NL*
a
little
comfort
;
when
I
mentioned
the
young
lady
's
name
,
who
is
no
*NL*
other
than
the
pretty
widow
Hunt
,
I
thought
she
turned
pale
;
but
when
*NL*
I
said
you
had
refused
her
,
I
will
be
sworn
her
face
was
all
over
*NL*
scarlet
in
an
instant
;
and
these
were
her
very
words
:
`
I
will
not
deny
*NL*
but
that
I
believe
he
has
some
affection
for
me
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
Western
,
who
*NL*
could
no
longer
be
kept
out
of
the
room
even
by
the
authority
of
*NL*
Allworthy
himself
;
though
this
,
as
we
have
often
seen
,
had
a
wonderful
*NL*
power
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Western
immediately
went
up
to
Jones
,
crying
out
,
``
My
old
friend
Tom
,
*NL*
I
am
glad
to
see
thee
with
all
my
heart
!
all
past
must
be
forgotten
;
I
*NL*
could
not
intend
any
affront
to
thee
,
because
,
as
Allworthy
here
*NL*
knows
,
nay
,
dost
know
it
thyself
,
I
took
thee
for
another
person
;
and
*NL*
where
a
body
means
no
harm
,
what
signifies
a
hasty
word
or
two
?
One
*NL*
Christian
must
forget
and
forgive
another
.
''
``
I
hope
,
sir
,
''
said
Jones
,
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
forget
the
many
obligations
I
have
had
to
you
;
but
as
*NL*
for
any
offence
towards
me
,
I
declare
I
am
an
utter
stranger
.
''
``
A
`
t
,
''
*NL*
says
Western
,
``
then
give
me
thy
fist
;
a
'
t
as
hearty
an
honest
cock
as
*NL*
any
in
the
kingdom
.
Come
along
with
me
;
I
'll
carry
thee
to
thy
*NL*
mistress
this
moment
.
''
Here
Allworthy
interposed
;
and
the
squire
being
*NL*
unable
to
prevail
either
with
the
uncle
or
nephew
,
was
,
after
some
*NL*
litigation
,
obliged
to
consent
to
delay
introducing
Jones
to
Sophia
*NL*
till
the
afternoon
;
at
which
time
Allworthy
,
as
well
in
compassion
to
*NL*
Jones
as
in
compliance
with
the
eager
desires
of
Western
,
was
*NL*
prevailed
upon
to
promise
to
attend
at
the
tea-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
which
now
ensued
was
pleasant
enough
;
and
with
which
,
*NL*
had
it
happened
earlier
in
our
history
,
we
would
have
entertained
our
*NL*
reader
;
but
as
we
have
now
leisure
only
to
attend
to
what
is
very
*NL*
material
,
it
shall
suffice
to
say
that
matters
being
entirely
adjusted
*NL*
as
to
the
afternoon
visit
Mr
Western
again
returned
home
.
*NL*

*NL*
Chapter
xi
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
draws
nearer
to
a
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr
Western
was
departed
,
Jones
began
to
inform
Mr
Allworthy
and
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
that
his
liberty
had
been
procured
by
two
noble
lords
,
who
,
*NL*
together
with
two
surgeons
and
a
friend
of
Mr
Nightingale
's
,
had
*NL*
attended
the
magistrate
by
whom
he
had
been
committed
,
and
by
whom
,
on
*NL*
the
surgeons
'
oaths
,
that
the
wounded
person
was
out
of
all
manner
of
*NL*
danger
from
his
wound
,
he
was
discharged
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
only
of
these
lords
,
he
said
,
he
had
ever
seen
before
,
and
that
no
*NL*
more
than
once
;
but
the
other
had
greatly
surprized
him
by
asking
his
*NL*
pardon
for
an
offence
he
had
been
guilty
of
towards
him
,
occasioned
,
*NL*
he
said
,
entirely
by
his
ignorance
who
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
reality
of
the
case
,
with
which
Jones
was
not
acquainted
till
*NL*
afterwards
,
was
this
:
--
The
lieutenant
whom
Lord
Fellamar
had
employed
,
*NL*
according
to
the
advice
of
Lady
Bellaston
,
to
press
Jones
as
a
*NL*
vagabond
into
the
sea-service
,
when
he
came
to
report
to
his
lordship
*NL*
the
event
which
we
have
before
seen
,
spoke
very
favourably
of
the
*NL*
behaviour
of
Mr
Jones
on
all
accounts
,
and
strongly
assured
that
lord
*NL*
that
he
must
have
mistaken
the
person
,
for
that
Jones
was
certainly
a
*NL*
gentleman
;
insomuch
that
his
lordship
,
who
was
strictly
a
man
of
*NL*
honour
,
and
would
by
no
means
have
been
guilty
of
an
action
which
the
*NL*
world
in
general
would
have
condemned
,
began
to
be
much
concerned
for
*NL*
the
advice
which
he
had
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
a
day
or
two
after
this
,
Lord
Fellamar
happened
to
dine
with
*NL*
the
Irish
peer
,
who
,
in
a
conversation
upon
the
duel
,
acquainted
his
*NL*
company
with
the
character
of
Fitzpatrick
;
to
which
,
indeed
,
he
did
*NL*
not
do
strict
justice
,
especially
in
what
related
to
his
lady
.
He
said
*NL*
she
was
the
most
innocent
,
the
most
injured
woman
alive
,
and
that
from
*NL*
compassion
alone
he
had
undertaken
her
cause
.
He
then
declared
an
*NL*
intention
of
going
the
next
morning
to
Fitzpatrick
's
lodgings
,
in
*NL*
order
to
prevail
with
him
,
if
possible
,
to
consent
to
a
separation
*NL*
from
his
wife
,
who
,
the
peer
said
,
was
in
apprehensions
for
her
life
,
*NL*
if
she
should
ever
return
to
be
under
the
power
of
her
husband
.
Lord
*NL*
Fellamar
agreed
to
go
with
him
,
that
he
might
satisfy
himself
more
*NL*
concerning
Jones
and
the
circumstances
of
the
duel
;
for
he
was
by
no
*NL*
means
easy
concerning
the
part
he
had
acted
.
The
moment
his
lordship
*NL*
gave
a
hint
of
his
readiness
to
assist
in
the
delivery
of
the
lady
,
it
*NL*
was
eagerly
embraced
by
the
other
nobleman
,
who
depended
much
on
the
*NL*
authority
of
Lord
Fellamar
,
as
he
thought
it
would
greatly
contribute
*NL*
to
awe
Fitzpatrick
into
a
compliance
;
and
perhaps
he
was
in
the
right
;
*NL*
for
the
poor
Irishman
no
sooner
saw
these
noble
peers
had
undertaken
*NL*
the
cause
of
his
wife
than
he
submitted
,
and
articles
of
separation
*NL*
were
soon
drawn
up
and
signed
between
the
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fitzpatrick
,
who
had
been
so
well
satisfied
by
Mrs
Waters
concerning
*NL*
the
innocence
of
his
wife
with
Jones
at
Upton
,
or
perhaps
,
from
some
*NL*
other
reasons
,
was
now
become
so
indifferent
to
that
matter
,
that
he
*NL*
spoke
highly
in
favour
of
Jones
to
Lord
Fellamar
,
took
all
the
blame
*NL*
upon
himself
,
and
said
the
other
had
behaved
very
much
like
a
*NL*
gentleman
and
a
man
of
honour
;
and
upon
that
lord
's
further
enquiry
*NL*
concerning
Mr
Jones
,
Fitzpatrick
told
him
he
was
nephew
to
a
gentleman
*NL*
of
very
great
fashion
and
fortune
,
which
was
the
account
he
had
just
*NL*
received
from
Mrs
Waters
after
her
interview
with
Dowling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lord
Fellamar
now
thought
it
behoved
him
to
do
everything
in
his
power
*NL*
to
make
satisfaction
to
a
gentleman
whom
he
had
so
grossly
injured
,
*NL*
and
without
any
consideration
of
rivalship
-LRB-
for
he
had
now
given
over
*NL*
all
thoughts
of
Sophia
-RRB-
,
determined
to
procure
Mr
Jones
's
liberty
,
*NL*
being
satisfied
,
as
well
from
Fitzpatrick
as
his
surgeon
,
that
the
*NL*
wound
was
not
mortal
.
He
therefore
prevailed
with
the
Irish
peer
to
*NL*
accompany
him
to
the
place
where
Jones
was
confined
,
to
whom
he
*NL*
behaved
as
we
have
already
related
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Allworthy
returned
to
his
lodgings
,
he
immediately
carried
Jones
*NL*
into
his
room
,
and
then
acquainted
him
with
the
whole
matter
,
as
well
*NL*
what
he
had
heard
from
Mrs
Waters
as
what
he
had
discovered
from
Mr
*NL*
Dowling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
expressed
great
astonishment
and
no
less
concern
at
this
*NL*
account
,
but
without
making
any
comment
or
observation
upon
it
.
And
*NL*
now
a
message
was
brought
from
Mr
Blifil
,
desiring
to
know
if
his
*NL*
uncle
was
at
leisure
that
he
might
wait
upon
him
.
Allworthy
started
*NL*
and
turned
pale
,
and
then
in
a
more
passionate
tone
than
I
believe
he
*NL*
had
ever
used
before
,
bid
the
servant
tell
Blifil
he
knew
him
not
.
*NL*
``
Consider
,
dear
sir
,
''
cries
Jones
,
in
a
trembling
voice
.
``
I
have
*NL*
considered
,
''
answered
Allworthy
,
``
and
you
yourself
shall
carry
my
*NL*
message
to
the
villain
.
No
one
can
carry
him
the
sentence
of
his
own
*NL*
ruin
so
properly
as
the
man
whose
ruin
he
hath
so
villanously
*NL*
contrived
.
''
``
Pardon
me
,
dear
sir
,
''
said
Jones
;
``
a
moment
's
reflection
*NL*
will
,
I
am
sure
,
convince
you
of
the
contrary
.
What
might
perhaps
be
*NL*
but
justice
from
another
tongue
,
would
from
mine
be
insult
;
and
to
*NL*
whom
?
--
my
own
brother
and
your
nephew
.
Nor
did
he
use
me
so
*NL*
barbarously
--
indeed
,
that
would
have
been
more
inexcusable
than
*NL*
anything
he
hath
done
.
Fortune
may
tempt
men
of
no
very
bad
*NL*
dispositions
to
injustice
;
but
insults
proceed
only
from
black
and
*NL*
rancorous
minds
,
and
have
no
temptations
to
excuse
them
.
Let
me
*NL*
beseech
you
,
sir
,
to
do
nothing
by
him
in
the
present
height
of
your
*NL*
anger
.
Consider
,
my
dear
uncle
,
I
was
not
myself
condemned
unheard
.
''
*NL*
Allworthy
stood
silent
a
moment
,
and
then
,
embracing
Jones
,
he
said
,
*NL*
with
tears
gushing
from
his
eyes
,
``
O
my
child
!
to
what
goodness
have
I
*NL*
been
so
long
blind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
entering
the
room
at
that
moment
,
after
a
gentle
rap
which
*NL*
was
not
perceived
,
and
seeing
Jones
in
the
arms
of
his
uncle
,
the
poor
*NL*
woman
in
an
agony
of
joy
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
burst
forth
into
the
*NL*
most
ecstatic
thanksgivings
to
heaven
for
what
had
happened
;
then
,
*NL*
running
to
Jones
,
she
embraced
him
eagerly
,
crying
,
``
My
dearest
*NL*
friend
,
I
wish
you
joy
a
thousand
and
a
thousand
times
of
this
blest
*NL*
day
.
''
And
next
Mr
Allworthy
himself
received
the
same
congratulations
.
*NL*
To
which
he
answered
,
``
Indeed
,
indeed
,
Mrs
Miller
,
I
am
beyond
*NL*
expression
happy
.
''
Some
few
more
raptures
having
passed
on
all
sides
,
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
desired
them
both
to
walk
down
to
dinner
in
the
parlour
,
*NL*
where
she
said
there
were
a
very
happy
set
of
people
assembled
--
being
*NL*
indeed
no
other
than
Mr
Nightingale
and
his
bride
,
and
his
cousin
*NL*
Harriet
with
her
bridegroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
excused
himself
from
dining
with
the
company
,
saying
he
had
*NL*
ordered
some
little
thing
for
him
and
his
nephew
in
his
own
apartment
,
*NL*
for
that
they
had
much
private
business
to
discourse
of
;
but
would
not
*NL*
resist
promising
the
good
woman
that
both
he
and
Jones
would
make
part
*NL*
of
her
society
at
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Miller
then
asked
what
was
to
be
done
with
Blifil
?
``
for
indeed
,
''
*NL*
says
she
,
``
I
can
not
be
easy
while
such
a
villain
is
in
my
*NL*
house
.
''
--
Allworthy
answered
,
``
He
was
as
uneasy
as
herself
on
the
same
*NL*
account
.
''
``
Oh
!
''
cries
she
,
``
if
that
be
the
case
,
leave
the
matter
to
*NL*
me
,
I
'll
soon
show
him
the
outside
out
of
my
doors
,
I
warrant
you
.
*NL*
Here
are
two
or
three
lusty
fellows
below-stairs
.
''
``
There
will
be
no
*NL*
need
of
any
violence
,
''
cries
Allworthy
;
``
if
you
will
carry
him
a
*NL*
message
from
me
,
he
will
,
I
am
convinced
,
depart
of
his
own
accord
.
''
*NL*
``
Will
I
?
''
said
Mrs
Miller
;
``
I
never
did
anything
in
my
life
with
a
*NL*
better
will
.
''
Here
Jones
interfered
,
and
said
,
``
He
had
considered
the
*NL*
matter
better
,
and
would
,
if
Mr
Allworthy
pleased
,
be
himself
the
*NL*
messenger
.
I
know
,
''
says
he
,
``
already
enough
of
your
pleasure
,
sir
,
*NL*
and
I
beg
leave
to
acquaint
him
with
it
by
my
own
words
.
Let
me
*NL*
beseech
you
,
sir
,
''
added
he
,
``
to
reflect
on
the
dreadful
consequences
*NL*
of
driving
him
to
violent
and
sudden
despair
.
How
unfit
,
alas
!
is
this
*NL*
poor
man
to
die
in
his
present
situation
.
''
This
suggestion
had
not
the
*NL*
least
effect
on
Mrs
Miller
.
She
left
the
room
,
crying
,
``
You
are
too
*NL*
good
,
Mr
Jones
,
infinitely
too
good
to
live
in
this
world
.
''
But
it
*NL*
made
a
deeper
impression
on
Allworthy
.
``
My
good
child
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
am
*NL*
equally
astonished
at
the
goodness
of
your
heart
,
and
the
quickness
of
*NL*
your
understanding
.
Heaven
indeed
forbid
that
this
wretch
should
be
*NL*
deprived
of
any
means
or
time
for
repentance
!
That
would
be
a
shocking
*NL*
consideration
indeed
.
Go
to
him
,
therefore
,
and
use
your
own
*NL*
discretion
;
yet
do
not
flatter
him
with
any
hopes
of
my
forgiveness
;
*NL*
for
I
shall
never
forgive
villany
farther
than
my
religion
obliges
me
,
*NL*
and
that
extends
not
either
to
our
bounty
or
our
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
went
up
to
Blifil
's
room
,
whom
he
found
in
a
situation
which
*NL*
moved
his
pity
,
though
it
would
have
raised
a
less
amiable
passion
in
*NL*
many
beholders
.
He
cast
himself
on
his
bed
,
where
he
lay
abandoning
*NL*
himself
to
despair
,
and
drowned
in
tears
;
not
in
such
tears
as
flow
*NL*
from
contrition
,
and
wash
away
guilt
from
minds
which
have
been
*NL*
seduced
or
surprized
into
it
unawares
,
against
the
bent
of
their
*NL*
natural
dispositions
,
as
will
sometimes
happen
from
human
frailty
,
*NL*
even
to
the
good
;
no
,
these
tears
were
such
as
the
frighted
thief
*NL*
sheds
in
his
cart
,
and
are
indeed
the
effects
of
that
concern
which
*NL*
the
most
savage
natures
are
seldom
deficient
in
feeling
for
*NL*
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
unpleasant
and
tedious
to
paint
this
scene
in
full
length
.
*NL*
Let
it
suffice
to
say
,
that
the
behaviour
of
Jones
was
kind
to
excess
.
*NL*
He
omitted
nothing
which
his
invention
could
supply
,
to
raise
and
*NL*
comfort
the
drooping
spirits
of
Blifil
,
before
he
communicated
to
him
*NL*
the
resolution
of
his
uncle
that
he
must
quit
the
house
that
evening
.
*NL*
He
offered
to
furnish
him
with
any
money
he
wanted
,
assured
him
of
his
*NL*
hearty
forgiveness
of
all
he
had
done
against
him
,
that
he
would
*NL*
endeavour
to
live
with
him
hereafter
as
a
brother
,
and
would
leave
*NL*
nothing
unattempted
to
effectuate
a
reconciliation
with
his
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blifil
was
at
first
sullen
and
silent
,
balancing
in
his
mind
whether
*NL*
he
should
yet
deny
all
;
but
,
finding
at
last
the
evidence
too
strong
*NL*
against
him
,
he
betook
himself
at
last
to
confession
.
He
then
asked
*NL*
pardon
of
his
brother
in
the
most
vehement
manner
,
prostrated
himself
*NL*
on
the
ground
,
and
kissed
his
feet
;
in
short
he
was
now
as
remarkably
*NL*
mean
as
he
had
been
before
remarkably
wicked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
could
not
so
far
check
his
disdain
,
but
that
it
a
little
*NL*
discovered
itself
in
his
countenance
at
this
extreme
servility
.
He
*NL*
raised
his
brother
the
moment
he
could
from
the
ground
,
and
advised
*NL*
him
to
bear
his
afflictions
more
like
a
man
;
repeating
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
his
promises
,
that
he
would
do
all
in
his
power
to
lessen
them
;
*NL*
for
which
Blifil
,
making
many
professions
of
his
unworthiness
,
poured
*NL*
forth
a
profusion
of
thanks
;
and
then
,
he
having
declared
he
would
*NL*
immediately
depart
to
another
lodging
,
Jones
returned
to
his
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
matters
,
Allworthy
now
acquainted
Jones
with
the
discovery
*NL*
which
he
had
made
concerning
the
L500
bank-notes
.
``
I
have
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
already
consulted
a
lawyer
,
who
tells
me
,
to
my
great
astonishment
,
*NL*
that
there
is
no
punishment
for
a
fraud
of
this
kind
.
Indeed
,
when
I
*NL*
consider
the
black
ingratitude
of
this
fellow
toward
you
,
I
think
a
*NL*
highwayman
,
compared
to
him
,
is
an
innocent
person
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Heaven
!
''
says
Jones
,
``
is
it
possible
?
--
I
am
shocked
beyond
*NL*
measure
at
this
news
.
I
thought
there
was
not
an
honester
fellow
in
*NL*
the
world
.
--
The
temptation
of
such
a
sum
was
too
great
for
him
to
*NL*
withstand
;
for
smaller
matters
have
come
safe
to
me
through
his
hand
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
my
dear
uncle
,
you
must
suffer
me
to
call
it
weakness
rather
*NL*
than
ingratitude
;
for
I
am
convinced
the
poor
fellow
loves
me
,
and
*NL*
hath
done
me
some
kindnesses
,
which
I
can
never
forget
;
nay
,
I
believe
*NL*
he
hath
repented
of
this
very
act
;
for
it
is
not
above
a
day
or
two
*NL*
ago
,
when
my
affairs
seemed
in
the
most
desperate
situation
,
that
he
*NL*
visited
me
in
my
confinement
,
and
offered
me
any
money
I
wanted
.
*NL*
Consider
,
sir
,
what
a
temptation
to
a
man
who
hath
tasted
such
bitter
*NL*
distress
,
it
must
be
,
to
have
a
sum
in
his
possession
which
must
put
*NL*
him
and
his
family
beyond
any
future
possibility
of
suffering
the
*NL*
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Child
,
''
cries
Allworthy
,
``
you
carry
this
forgiving
temper
too
far
.
*NL*
Such
mistaken
mercy
is
not
only
weakness
,
but
borders
on
injustice
,
*NL*
and
is
very
pernicious
to
society
,
as
it
encourages
vice
.
The
*NL*
dishonesty
of
this
fellow
I
might
,
perhaps
,
have
pardoned
,
but
never
*NL*
his
ingratitude
.
And
give
me
leave
to
say
,
when
we
suffer
any
*NL*
temptation
to
atone
for
dishonesty
itself
,
we
are
as
candid
and
*NL*
merciful
as
we
ought
to
be
;
and
so
far
I
confess
I
have
gone
;
for
I
*NL*
have
often
pitied
the
fate
of
a
highwayman
,
when
I
have
been
on
the
*NL*
grand
jury
;
and
have
more
than
once
applied
to
the
judge
on
the
behalf
*NL*
of
such
as
have
had
any
mitigating
circumstances
in
their
case
;
but
*NL*
when
dishonesty
is
attended
with
any
blacker
crime
,
such
as
cruelty
,
*NL*
murder
,
ingratitude
,
or
the
like
,
compassion
and
forgiveness
then
*NL*
become
faults
.
I
am
convinced
the
fellow
is
a
villain
,
and
he
shall
be
*NL*
punished
;
at
least
as
far
as
I
can
punish
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
spoken
with
so
stern
a
voice
,
that
Jones
did
not
think
proper
*NL*
to
make
any
reply
;
besides
,
the
hour
appointed
by
Mr
Western
now
drew
*NL*
so
near
,
that
he
had
barely
time
left
to
dress
himself
.
Here
therefore
*NL*
ended
the
present
dialogue
,
and
Jones
retired
to
another
room
,
where
*NL*
Partridge
attended
,
according
to
order
,
with
his
cloaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Partridge
had
scarce
seen
his
master
since
the
happy
discovery
.
The
*NL*
poor
fellow
was
unable
either
to
contain
or
express
his
transports
.
He
*NL*
behaved
like
one
frantic
,
and
made
almost
as
many
mistakes
while
he
*NL*
was
dressing
Jones
as
I
have
seen
made
by
Harlequin
in
dressing
*NL*
himself
on
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
memory
,
however
,
was
not
in
the
least
deficient
.
He
recollected
*NL*
now
many
omens
and
presages
of
this
happy
event
,
some
of
which
he
had
*NL*
remarked
at
the
time
,
but
many
more
he
now
remembered
;
nor
did
he
omit
*NL*
the
dreams
he
had
dreamt
the
evening
before
his
meeting
with
Jones
;
*NL*
and
concluded
with
saying
,
``
I
always
told
your
honour
something
boded
*NL*
in
my
mind
that
you
would
one
time
or
other
have
it
in
your
power
to
*NL*
make
my
fortune
.
''
Jones
assured
him
that
this
boding
should
as
*NL*
certainly
be
verified
with
regard
to
him
as
all
the
other
omens
had
*NL*
been
to
himself
;
which
did
not
a
little
add
to
all
the
raptures
which
*NL*
the
poor
fellow
had
already
conceived
on
account
of
his
master
.

*NL*
Approaching
still
nearer
to
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jones
,
being
now
completely
dressed
,
attended
his
uncle
to
Mr
*NL*
Western
's
.
He
was
,
indeed
,
one
of
the
finest
figures
ever
beheld
,
and
*NL*
his
person
alone
would
have
charmed
the
greater
part
of
womankind
;
but
*NL*
we
hope
it
hath
already
appeared
in
this
history
that
Nature
,
when
she
*NL*
formed
him
,
did
not
totally
rely
,
as
she
sometimes
doth
,
on
this
merit
*NL*
only
,
to
recommend
her
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
,
who
,
angry
as
she
was
,
was
likewise
set
forth
to
the
best
*NL*
advantage
,
for
which
I
leave
my
female
readers
to
account
,
appeared
so
*NL*
extremely
beautiful
,
that
even
Allworthy
,
when
he
saw
her
,
could
not
*NL*
forbear
whispering
Western
,
that
he
believed
she
was
the
finest
*NL*
creature
in
the
world
.
To
which
Western
answered
,
in
a
whisper
,
*NL*
overheard
by
all
present
,
``
So
much
the
better
for
Tom
;
--
for
d
--
n
me
if
*NL*
he
sha
n't
ha
the
tousling
her
.
''
Sophia
was
all
over
scarlet
at
these
*NL*
words
,
while
Tom
's
countenance
was
altogether
as
pale
,
and
he
was
*NL*
almost
ready
to
sink
from
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tea-table
was
scarce
removed
before
Western
lugged
Allworthy
out
*NL*
of
the
room
,
telling
him
he
had
business
of
consequence
to
impart
,
and
*NL*
must
speak
to
him
that
instant
in
private
,
before
he
forgot
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lovers
were
now
alone
,
and
it
will
,
I
question
not
,
appear
strange
*NL*
to
many
readers
,
that
those
who
had
so
much
to
say
to
one
another
when
*NL*
danger
and
difficulty
attended
their
conversation
,
and
who
seemed
so
*NL*
eager
to
rush
into
each
other
's
arms
when
so
many
bars
lay
in
their
*NL*
way
,
now
that
with
safety
they
were
at
liberty
to
say
or
do
whatever
*NL*
they
pleased
,
should
both
remain
for
some
time
silent
and
motionless
;
*NL*
insomuch
that
a
stranger
of
moderate
sagacity
might
have
well
*NL*
concluded
they
were
mutually
indifferent
;
but
so
it
was
,
however
*NL*
strange
it
may
seem
;
both
sat
with
their
eyes
cast
downwards
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
for
some
minutes
continued
in
perfect
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Jones
during
this
interval
attempted
once
or
twice
to
speak
,
but
*NL*
was
absolutely
incapable
,
muttering
only
,
or
rather
sighing
out
,
some
*NL*
broken
words
;
when
Sophia
at
length
,
partly
out
of
pity
to
him
,
and
*NL*
partly
to
turn
the
discourse
from
the
subject
which
she
knew
well
*NL*
enough
he
was
endeavouring
to
open
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
sir
,
you
are
the
most
fortunate
man
in
the
world
in
this
*NL*
discovery
.
''
``
And
can
you
really
,
madam
,
think
me
so
fortunate
,
''
said
*NL*
Jones
,
sighing
,
``
while
I
have
incurred
your
displeasure
?
''
--
``
Nay
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
says
she
,
``
as
to
that
you
best
know
whether
you
have
deserved
it
.
''
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
madam
,
''
answered
he
,
``
you
yourself
are
as
well
apprized
of
*NL*
all
my
demerits
.
Mrs
Miller
hath
acquainted
you
with
the
whole
truth
.
*NL*
O
!
my
Sophia
,
am
I
never
to
hope
for
forgiveness
?
''
--
``
I
think
,
Mr
*NL*
Jones
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
may
almost
depend
on
your
own
justice
,
and
leave
*NL*
it
to
yourself
to
pass
sentence
on
your
own
conduct
.
''
--
``
Alas
!
madam
,
''
*NL*
answered
he
,
``
it
is
mercy
,
and
not
justice
,
which
I
implore
at
your
*NL*
hands
.
Justice
I
know
must
condemn
me
.
--
Yet
not
for
the
letter
I
sent
*NL*
to
Lady
Bellaston
.
Of
that
I
most
solemnly
declare
you
have
had
a
true
*NL*
account
.
''
He
then
insisted
much
on
the
security
given
him
by
*NL*
Nightingale
of
a
fair
pretence
for
breaking
off
,
if
,
contrary
to
their
*NL*
expectations
,
her
ladyship
should
have
accepted
his
offer
;
but
confest
*NL*
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
a
great
indiscretion
to
put
such
a
letter
*NL*
as
that
into
her
power
,
``
which
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
have
dearly
paid
for
,
in
*NL*
the
effect
it
has
upon
you
.
''
``
I
do
not
,
I
can
not
,
''
says
she
,
``
believe
*NL*
otherwise
of
that
letter
than
you
would
have
me
.
My
conduct
,
I
think
,
*NL*
shews
you
clearly
I
do
not
believe
there
is
much
in
that
.
And
yet
,
Mr
*NL*
Jones
,
have
I
not
enough
to
resent
?
After
what
past
at
Upton
,
so
soon
*NL*
to
engage
in
a
new
amour
with
another
woman
,
while
I
fancied

you
*NL*
pretended

your
heart
was
bleeding
for
me

Indeed

you
have
acted
*NL*
strangely
.
Can
I
believe
the
passion
you
have
profest
to
me
to
be
*NL*
sincere
?
Or
,
if
I
can
,
what
happiness
can
I
assure
myself
of
with
a
*NL*
man
capable
of
so
much
inconstancy

``
O

Sophia

cries
he
,
``

not
*NL*
doubt

sincerity

Could
I

distant
hopes

being
ever
permitted
to
throw
myself
at

enough

is
past

not

answered

will
obtain
the
pardon

mind
may
be
imposed
on
;

is
there
any

method

prevent

however

prevailed
on

your
repentance

sincerity

``
Name
any

answered
Jones
eagerly
.
``

replied
she
;

Jones

blushed

half
smiled

forcing
*NL*
again
her
brow
into
a
frown

Jones

very
gravely

it
me
at

all

come
,
when
I
shall
call
you
*NL*
mine
;
when
fears
shall
be
no
more
;
when
I
shall
have
that
dear
,
that
*NL*
vast
,
that
exquisite
,
ecstatic
delight
of
making
my
Sophia
*NL*
happy
?

``
Indeed

sir

said
she
,
``
that
day
is
in
your
own
*NL*
power

--
``
O
!
my
dear
,
my
divine
angel

cried
he
,
``
these
words
have
*NL*
made
me
mad
with
joy

But
I
must

I
will
thank
those
dear
lips
*NL*
which
have
so
sweetly
pronounced
my
bliss

He
then
caught
her
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
and
kissed
her
with
an
ardour
he
had
never
ventured
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
instant
Western
,
who
had
stood
some
time
listening
,
burst
into
*NL*
the
room
,
and
,
with
his
hunting
voice
and
phrase
,
cried
out
,
``

Sophia

Jones
then
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
kissed
her
hand
in
an
*NL*
agony
of
joy
,
while
Western
began
to
caper
and
dance
about
the
room
,
*NL*
presently
crying
out
--
``
Where
the
devil
is

He

without

He
then
sallied
out
in
quest
of
him
,
and
very
*NL*
opportunely
left
the
lovers
to
enjoy
a
few
tender
minutes
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
soon
returned
with
Allworthy
,
saying
,
``
If

Such

not

Allworthy

quoth
the

,

``

``
You
must
pardon

answered
Allworthy
;
``
I
have
given
a
solemn

,
and
*NL*
that
you
know
I
never

.
''
``
Why
,
prithee
,
who
art
engaged

''
*NL*
cries
the
squire
.
--
Allworthy
then
informed
him
,
as
likewise
of
the
*NL*
company
.
--
``
Odzookers

answered
the
squire
,
``
I
will
go
with

so

I
wo
n't
part

;
and
it
would
*NL*
be
barbarous
to
part
Tom
and
the
girl
.
''
This
offer
was
presently
*NL*
embraced
by
Allworthy
,
and
Sophia
consented
,
having
first
obtained
a
*NL*
private
promise
from
her
father
that
he
would
not
mention
a
syllable
*NL*
concerning
her
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
which
the
history
is
concluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Nightingale
had
been
that
afternoon
,
by
appointment
,
to
wait
on
*NL*
his
father
,
who
received
him
much
more
kindly
than
he
expected
.
There
*NL*
likewise
he
met
his
uncle
,
who
was
returned
to
town
in
quest
of
his
*NL*
new-married
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
marriage
was
the
luckiest
incident
which
could
have
happened
to
*NL*
the
young
gentleman
;
for
these
brothers
lived
in
a
constant
state
of
*NL*
contention
about
the
government
of
their
children
,
both
heartily
*NL*
despising
the
method
which
each
other
took
.
Each
of
them
therefore
now
*NL*
endeavoured
,
as
much
as
he
could
,
to
palliate
the
offence
which
his
*NL*
own
child
had
committed
,
and
to
aggravate
the
match
of
the
other
.
This
*NL*
desire
of
triumphing
over
his
brother
,
added
to
the
many
arguments
*NL*
which
Allworthy
had
used
,
so
strongly
operated
on
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
that
he
met
his
son
with
a
smiling
countenance
,
and
actually
agreed
to
*NL*
sup
with
him
that
evening
at
Mrs
Miller
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
other
,
who
really
loved
his
daughter
with
the
most
*NL*
immoderate
affection
,
there
was
little
difficulty
in
inclining
him
to
*NL*
a
reconciliation
.
He
was
no
sooner
informed
by
his
nephew
where
his
*NL*
daughter
and
her
husband
were
,
than
he
declared
he
would
instantly
go
*NL*
to
her
.
And
when
he
arrived
there
he
scarce
suffered
her
to
fall
upon
*NL*
her
knees
before
he
took
her
up
,
and
embraced
her
with
a
tenderness
*NL*
which
affected
all
who
saw
him
;
and
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
was
as
well
reconciled
to
both
her
and
her
husband
as
if
he
had
*NL*
himself
joined
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
situation
were
affairs
when
Mr
Allworthy
and
his
company
*NL*
arrived
to
complete
the
happiness
of
Mrs
Miller
,
who
no
sooner
saw
*NL*
Sophia
than
she
guessed
everything
that
had
happened
;
and
so
great
was
*NL*
her
friendship
to
Jones
,
that
it
added
not
a
few
transports
to
those
*NL*
she
felt
on
the
happiness
of
her
own
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
have
not
,
I
believe
,
been
many
instances
of
a
number
of
people
*NL*
met
together
,
where
every
one
was
so
perfectly
happy
as
in
this
*NL*
company
.
Amongst
whom
the
father
of
young
Nightingale
enjoyed
the
*NL*
least
perfect
content
;
for
,
notwithstanding
his
affection
for
his
son
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
authority
and
the
arguments
of
Allworthy
,
together
*NL*
with
the
other
motive
mentioned
before
,
he
could
not
so
entirely
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
his
son
's
choice
;
and
,
perhaps
,
the
presence
of
Sophia
*NL*
herself
tended
a
little
to
aggravate
and
heighten
his
concern
,
as
a
*NL*
thought
now
and
then
suggested
itself
that
his
son
might
have
had
that
*NL*
lady
,
or
some
other
such
.
Not
that
any
of
the
charms
which
adorned
*NL*
either
the
person
or
mind
of
Sophia
created
the
uneasiness
;
it
was
the
*NL*
contents
of
her
father
's
coffers
which
set
his
heart
a
longing
.
These
*NL*
were
the
charms
which
he
could
not
bear
to
think
his
son
had
*NL*
sacrificed
to
the
daughter
of
Mrs
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brides
were
both
very
pretty
women
;
but
so
totally
were
they
*NL*
eclipsed
by
the
beauty
of
Sophia
,
that
,
had
they
not
been
two
of
the
*NL*
best-tempered
girls
in
the
world
,
it
would
have
raised
some
envy
in
*NL*
their
breasts
;
for
neither
of
their
husbands
could
long
keep
his
eyes
*NL*
from
Sophia
,
who
sat
at
the
table
like
a
queen
receiving
homage
,
or
,
*NL*
rather
,
like
a
superior
being
receiving
adoration
from
all
around
her
.
*NL*
But
it
was
an
adoration
which
they
gave
,
not
which
she
exacted
;
for
*NL*
she
was
as
much
distinguished
by
her
modesty
and
affability
as
by
all
*NL*
her
other
perfections
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
was
spent
in
much
true
mirth
.
All
were
happy
,
but
those
*NL*
the
most
who
had
been
most
unhappy
before
.
Their
former
sufferings
and
*NL*
fears
gave
such
a
relish
to
their
felicity
as
even
love
and
fortune
,
*NL*
in
their
fullest
flow
,
could
not
have
given
without
the
advantage
of
*NL*
such
a
comparison
.
Yet
,
as
great
joy
,
especially
after
a
sudden
change
*NL*
and
revolution
of
circumstances
,
is
apt
to
be
silent
,
and
dwells
*NL*
rather
in
the
heart
than
on
the
tongue
,
Jones
and
Sophia
appeared
the
*NL*
least
merry
of
the
whole
company
;
which
Western
observed
with
great
*NL*
impatience
,
often
crying
out
to
them
,
``
Why
dost
not
talk
,
boy
?
Why
*NL*
dost
look
so
grave
?
Hast
lost
thy
tongue
,
girl
?
Drink
another
glass
of
*NL*
wine
;
sha
'
t
drink
another
glass
.
''
And
,
the
more
to
enliven
her
,
he
*NL*
would
sometimes
sing
a
merry
song
,
which
bore
some
relation
to
*NL*
matrimony
and
the
loss
of
a
maidenhead
.
Nay
,
he
would
have
proceeded
*NL*
so
far
on
that
topic
as
to
have
driven
her
out
of
the
room
,
if
Mr
*NL*
Allworthy
had
not
checkt
him
,
sometimes
by
looks
,
and
once
or
twice
by
*NL*
a
``
Fie
!
Mr
Western
!
''
He
began
,
indeed
,
once
to
debate
the
matter
,
and
*NL*
assert
his
right
to
talk
to
his
own
daughter
as
he
thought
fit
;
but
,
*NL*
as
nobody
seconded
him
,
he
was
soon
reduced
to
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
this
little
restraint
,
he
was
so
pleased
with
the
*NL*
chearfulness
and
good-humour
of
the
company
,
that
he
insisted
on
their
*NL*
meeting
the
next
day
at
his
lodgings
.
They
all
did
so
;
and
the
lovely
*NL*
Sophia
,
who
was
now
in
private
become
a
bride
too
,
officiated
as
the
*NL*
mistress
of
the
ceremonies
,
or
,
in
the
polite
phrase
,
did
the
honours
*NL*
of
the
table
.
She
had
that
morning
given
her
hand
to
Jones
,
in
the
*NL*
chapel
at
Doctors

where
Mr
Allworthy
,
Mr
Western
,
and
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
,
were
the
only
persons
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
had
earnestly
desired
her
father
that
no
others
of
the
company
,
*NL*
who
were
that
day
to
dine
with
him
,
should
be
acquainted
with
her
*NL*
marriage
.
The
same
secrecy
was
enjoined
to
Mrs
Miller
,
and
Jones
*NL*
undertook
for
Allworthy
.
This
somewhat
reconciled
the
delicacy
of
*NL*
Sophia
to
the
public
entertainment
which
,
in
compliance
with
her
*NL*
father
's
will
,
she
was
obliged
to
go
to
,
greatly
against
her
own
*NL*
inclinations
.
In
confidence
of
this
secrecy
she
went
through
the
day
*NL*
pretty
well
,
till
the
squire
,
who
was
now
advanced
into
the
second
*NL*
bottle
,
could
contain
his
joy
no
longer
,
but
,
filling
out
a
bumper
,
*NL*
drank
a
health
to
the
bride
.
The
health
was
immediately
pledged
by
all
*NL*
present
,
to
the
great
confusion
of
our
poor
blushing
Sophia
,
and
the
*NL*
great
concern
of
Jones
upon
her
account
.
To
say
truth
,
there
was
not
a
*NL*
person
present
made
wiser
by
this
discovery
;
for
Mrs
Miller
had
*NL*
whispered
it
to
her
daughter
,
her
daughter
to
her
husband
,
her
husband
*NL*
to
his
sister
,
and
she
to
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
now
took
the
first
opportunity
of
withdrawing
with
the
ladies
,
*NL*
and
the
squire
sat
in
to
his
cups
,
in
which
he
was
,
by
degrees
,
*NL*
deserted
by
all
the
company
except
the
uncle
of
young
Nightingale
,
who
*NL*
loved
his
bottle
as
well
as
Western
himself
.
These
two
,
therefore
,
sat
*NL*
stoutly
to
it
during
the
whole
evening
,
and
long
after
that
happy
hour
*NL*
which
had
surrendered
the
charming
Sophia
to
the
eager
arms
of
her
*NL*
enraptured
Jones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
reader
,
we
have
at
length
brought
our
history
to
a
conclusion
,
*NL*
in
which
,
to
our
great
pleasure
,
though
contrary
,
perhaps
,
to
thy
*NL*
expectation
,
Mr
Jones
appears
to
be
the
happiest
of
all
humankind
;
for
*NL*
what
happiness
this
world
affords
equal
to
the
possession
of
such
a
*NL*
woman
as
Sophia
,
I
sincerely
own
I
have
never
yet
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
other
persons
who
have
made
any
considerable
figure
in
this
*NL*
history
,
as
some
may
desire
to
know
a
little
more
concerning
them
,
we
*NL*
will
proceed
,
in
as
few
words
as
possible
,
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
hath
never
yet
been
prevailed
upon
to
see
Blifil
,
but
he
*NL*
hath
yielded
to
the
importunity
of
Jones
,
backed
by
Sophia
,
to
settle
*NL*
L200
a-year
upon
him
;
to
which
Jones
hath
privately
added
a
third
.
*NL*
Upon
this
income
he
lives
in
one
of
the
northern
counties
,
about
200
*NL*
miles
distant
from
London
,
and
lays
up
L200
a-year
out
of
it
,
in
order
*NL*
to
purchase
a
seat
in
the
next
parliament
from
a
neighbouring
borough
,
*NL*
which
he
has
bargained
for
with
an
attourney
there
.
He
is
also
lately
*NL*
turned
Methodist
,
in
hopes
of
marrying
a
very
rich
widow
of
that
sect
,
*NL*
whose
estate
lies
in
that
part
of
the
kingdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Square
died
soon
after
he
writ
the
before-mentioned
letter
;
and
as
to
*NL*
Thwackum
,
he
continues
at
his
vicarage
.
He
hath
made
many
fruitless
*NL*
attempts
to
regain
the
confidence
of
Allworthy
,
or
to
ingratiate
*NL*
himself
with
Jones
,
both
of
whom
he
flatters
to
their
faces
,
and
*NL*
abuses
behind
their
backs
.
But
in
his
stead
,
Mr
Allworthy
hath
lately
*NL*
taken
Mr
Abraham
Adams
into
his
house
,
of
whom
Sophia
is
grown
*NL*
immoderately
fond
,
and
declares
he
shall
have
the
tuition
of
her
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Fitzpatrick
is
separated
from
her
husband
,
and
retains
the
little
*NL*
remains
of
her
fortune
.
She
lives
in
reputation
at
the
polite
end
of
*NL*
the
town
,
and
is
so
good
an
economist
,
that
she
spends
three
times
*NL*
the
income
of
her
fortune
,
without
running
into
debt
.
She
maintains
a
*NL*
perfect
intimacy
with
the
lady
of
the
Irish
peer
;
and
in
acts
of
*NL*
friendship
to
her
repays
all
obligations
she
owes
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs
Western
was
soon
reconciled
to
her
niece
Sophia
,
and
hath
spent
*NL*
two
months
together
with
her
in
the
country
.
Lady
Bellaston
made
the
*NL*
latter
a
formal
visit
at
her
return
to
town
,
where
she
behaved
to
*NL*
Jones
as
a
perfect
stranger
,
and
,
with
great
civility
,
wished
him
joy
*NL*
on
his
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr
Nightingale
hath
purchased
an
estate
for
his
son
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
of
Jones
,
where
the
young
gentleman
,
his
lady
,
Mrs
*NL*
Miller
,
and
her
little
daughter
reside
,
and
the
most
agreeable
*NL*
intercourse
subsists
between
the
two
families
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
those
of
lower
account
,
Mrs
Waters
returned
into
the
country
,
*NL*
had
a
pension
of
L60
a-year
settled
upon
her
by
Mr
Allworthy
,
and
is
*NL*
married
to
Parson
Supple
,
on
whom
,
at
the
instance
of
Sophia
,
Western
*NL*
hath
bestowed
a
considerable
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
Black
George
,
hearing
the
discovery
that
had
been
made
,
ran
away
,
and
*NL*
was
never
since
heard
of
;
and
Jones
bestowed
the
money
on
his
family
,
*NL*
but
not
in
equal
proportions
,
for
Molly
had
much
the
greatest
share
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Partridge
,
Jones
hath
settled
L50
a-year
on
him
;
and
he
hath
*NL*
again
set
up
a
school
,
in
which
he
meets
with
much
better
*NL*
encouragement
than
formerly
,
and
there
is
now
a
treaty
of
marriage
on
*NL*
foot
between
him
and
Miss
Molly
Seagrim
,
which
,
through
the
mediation
*NL*
of
Sophia
,
is
likely
to
take
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
now
return
to
take
leave
of
Mr
Jones
and
Sophia
,
who
,
within
two
*NL*
days
after
their
marriage
,
attended
Mr
Western
and
Mr
Allworthy
into
*NL*
the
country
.
Western
hath
resigned
his
family
seat
,
and
the
greater
*NL*
part
of
his
estate
,
to
his
son-in-law
,
and
hath
retired
to
a
lesser
*NL*
house
of
his
in
another
part
of
the
country
,
which
is
better
for
*NL*
hunting
.
Indeed
,
he
is
often
as
a
visitant
with
Mr
Jones
,
who
,
as
well
*NL*
as
his
daughter
,
hath
an
infinite
delight
in
doing
everything
in
their
*NL*
power
to
please
him
.
And
this
desire
of
theirs
is
attended
with
such
*NL*
success
,
that
the
old
gentleman
declares
he
was
never
happy
in
his
*NL*
life
till
now
.
He
hath
here
a
parlour
and
ante-chamber
to
himself
,
*NL*
where
he
gets
drunk
with
whom
he
pleases
:
and
his
daughter
is
still
as
*NL*
ready
as
formerly
to
play
to
him
whenever
he
desires
it
;
for
Jones
*NL*
hath
assured
her
that
,
as
,
next
to
pleasing
her
,
one
of
his
highest
*NL*
satisfactions
is
to
contribute
to
the
happiness
of
the
old
man
;
so
,
*NL*
the
great
duty
which
she
expresses
and
performs
to
her
father
,
renders
*NL*
her
almost
equally
dear
to
him
with
the
love
which
she
bestows
on
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sophia
hath
already
produced
him
two
fine
children
,
a
boy
and
a
girl
,
*NL*
of
whom
the
old
gentleman
is
so
fond
,
that
he
spends
much
of
his
time
*NL*
in
the
nursery
,
where
he
declares
the
tattling
of
his
little
*NL*
grand-daughter
,
who
is
above
a
year
and
a
half
old
,
is
sweeter
music
*NL*
than
the
finest
cry
of
dogs
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allworthy
was
likewise
greatly
liberal
to
Jones
on
the
marriage
,
and
*NL*
hath
omitted
no
instance
of
shewing
his
affection
to
him
and
his
lady
,
*NL*
who
love
him
as
a
father
.
Whatever
in
the
nature
of
Jones
had
a
*NL*
tendency
to
vice
,
has
been
corrected
by
continual
conversation
with
*NL*
this
good
man
,
and
by
his
union
with
the
lovely
and
virtuous
Sophia
.
*NL*
He
hath
also
,
by
reflection
on
his
past
follies
,
acquired
a
discretion
*NL*
and
prudence
very
uncommon
in
one
of
his
lively
parts
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
conclude
,
as
there
are
not
to
be
found
a
worthier
man
and
woman
,
*NL*
than
this
fond
couple
,
so
neither
can
any
be
imagined
more
happy
.
They
*NL*
preserve
the
purest
and
tenderest
affection
for
each
other
,
an
*NL*
affection
daily
encreased
and
confirmed
by
mutual
endearments
and
*NL*
mutual
esteem
.
Nor
is
their
conduct
towards
their
relations
and
*NL*
friends
less
amiable
than
towards
one
another
.
And
such
is
their
*NL*
condescension
,
their
indulgence
,
and
their
beneficence
to
those
below
*NL*
them
,
that
there
is
not
a
neighbour
,
a
tenant
,
or
a
servant
,
who
doth
*NL*
not
most
gratefully
bless
the
day
when
Mr
Jones
was
married
to
his
*NL*
Sophia
.
