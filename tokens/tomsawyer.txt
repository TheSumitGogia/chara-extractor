PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
adventures
recorded
in
this
book
really
occurred
;
one
or
two
*NL*
were
experiences
of
my
own
,
the
rest
those
of
boys
who
were
schoolmates
*NL*
of
mine
.
Huck
Finn
is
drawn
from
life
;
Tom
Sawyer
also
,
but
not
from
an
*NL*
individual
--
he
is
a
combination
of
the
characteristics
of
three
boys
whom
*NL*
I
knew
,
and
therefore
belongs
to
the
composite
order
of
architecture
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
odd
superstitions
touched
upon
were
all
prevalent
among
children
and
*NL*
slaves
in
the
West
at
the
period
of
this
story
--
that
is
to
say
,
thirty
or
*NL*
forty
years
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
my
book
is
intended
mainly
for
the
entertainment
of
boys
and
*NL*
girls
,
I
hope
it
will
not
be
shunned
by
men
and
women
on
that
account
,
*NL*
for
part
of
my
plan
has
been
to
try
to
pleasantly
remind
adults
of
what
*NL*
they
once
were
themselves
,
and
of
how
they
felt
and
thought
and
talked
,
*NL*
and
what
queer
enterprises
they
sometimes
engaged
in
.

*NL*

*NL*

``
What
's
gone
with
that
boy
,
I
wonder
?

''
*NL*
*NL*
No
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
pulled
her
spectacles
down
and
looked
over
them
about
the
*NL*
room
;
then
she
put
them
up
and
looked
out
under
them
.
She
seldom
or
*NL*
never
looked
_
through
_
them
for
so
small
a
thing
as
a
boy
;
they
were
*NL*
her
state
pair
,
the
pride
of
her
heart
,
and
were
built
for
``
style
,
''
not
*NL*
service
--
she
could
have
seen
through
a
pair
of
stove-lids
just
as
well
.
*NL*
She
looked
perplexed
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
not
fiercely
,
but
*NL*
still
loud
enough
for
the
furniture
to
hear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
lay
if
I
get
hold
of
you
I
'll
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
finish
,
for
by
this
time
she
was
bending
down
and
punching
*NL*
under
the
bed
with
the
broom
,
and
so
she
needed
breath
to
punctuate
the
*NL*
punches
with
.
She
resurrected
nothing
but
the
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
did
see
the
beat
of
that
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
the
open
door
and
stood
in
it
and
looked
out
among
the
*NL*
tomato
vines
and
``
jimpson
''
weeds
that
constituted
the
garden
.
No
Tom
.
So
*NL*
she
lifted
up
her
voice
at
an
angle
calculated
for
distance
and
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Y-o-u-u
TOM
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
slight
noise
behind
her
and
she
turned
just
in
time
to
seize
*NL*
a
small
boy
by
the
slack
of
his
roundabout
and
arrest
his
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
I
might
`
a
'
thought
of
that
closet
.
What
you
been
doing
in
*NL*
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
!
Look
at
your
hands
.
And
look
at
your
mouth
.
What
_
is
_
that
*NL*
truck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
know
.
It
's
jam
--
that
's
what
it
is
.
Forty
times
I
've
said
if
you
*NL*
did
n't
let
that
jam
alone
I
'd
skin
you
.
Hand
me
that
switch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
switch
hovered
in
the
air
--
the
peril
was
desperate
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
!
Look
behind
you
,
aunt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
whirled
round
,
and
snatched
her
skirts
out
of
danger
.
*NL*
The
lad
fled
on
the
instant
,
scrambled
up
the
high
board-fence
,
and
*NL*
disappeared
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
aunt
Polly
stood
surprised
a
moment
,
and
then
broke
into
a
gentle
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
the
boy
,
ca
n't
I
never
learn
anything
?
Ai
n't
he
played
me
tricks
*NL*
enough
like
that
for
me
to
be
looking
out
for
him
by
this
time
?
But
old
*NL*
fools
is
the
biggest
fools
there

tricks

goodness
,
he
never
plays
them
alike
,
two
days
,
*NL*
and
how
is
a
body
to
know
what
's
coming
?
He
`
pears
to
know
just
how
long
*NL*
he
can
torment
me
before
I
get
my
dander
up
,
and
he
knows
if
he
can
make
*NL*
out
to
put
me
off
for
a
minute
or
make
me
laugh
,
it
's
all
down
again
and
*NL*
I
ca
n't
hit
him
a
lick
.
I
ai
n't
doing
my
duty
by
that
boy
,
and
that
's
*NL*
the
Lord
's
truth
,
goodness
knows
.
Spare
the
rod
and
spile
the
child
,
*NL*
as
the
Good
Book
says
.
I
'm
a
laying
up
sin
and
suffering
for
us
both
,
*NL*
I
know
.
He
's
full
of
the
Old
Scratch
,
but
laws-a-me
!
he
's
my
own
*NL*
dead
sister
's
boy
,
poor
thing
,
and
I
ai
n't
got
the
heart
to
lash
him
,
*NL*
somehow
.
Every
time
I
let
him
off
,
my
conscience
does
hurt
me
so
,
and
*NL*
every
time
I
hit
him
my
old
heart
most
breaks
.
Well-a-well
,
man
that
is
*NL*
born
of
woman
is
of
few
days
and
full
of
trouble
,
as
the
Scripture
*NL*
says
,
and
I
reckon
it
's
so
.
He
'll
play
hookey
this
evening
,
*
and
-LSB-
*
*NL*
Southwestern
for
``
afternoon
''
-RSB-
I
'll
just
be
obleeged
to
make
him
work
,
*NL*
tomorrow
,
to
punish
him
.
It
's
mighty
hard
to
make
him
work
Saturdays
,
*NL*
when
all
the
boys
is
having
holiday
,
but
he
hates
work
more
than
he
*NL*
hates
anything
else
,
and
I
've
_
got
_
to
do
some
of
my
duty
by
him
,
or
*NL*
I
'll
be
the
ruination
of
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
did
play
hookey
,
and
he
had
a
very
good
time
.
He
got
back
home
*NL*
barely
in
season
to
help
Jim
,
the
small
colored
boy
,
saw
next-day
's
wood
*NL*
and
split
the
kindlings
before
supper
--
at
least
he
was
there
in
time
*NL*
to
tell
his
adventures
to
Jim
while
Jim
did
three-fourths
of
the
work
.
*NL*
Tom
's
younger
brother
-LRB-
or
rather
half-brother
-RRB-
Sid
was
already
through
*NL*
with
his
part
of
the
work
-LRB-
picking
up
chips
-RRB-
,
for
he
was
a
quiet
boy
,
*NL*
and
had
no
adventurous
,
trouble-some
ways
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Tom
was
eating
his
supper
,
and
stealing
sugar
as
opportunity
*NL*
offered
,
Aunt
Polly
asked
him
questions
that
were
full
of
guile
,
and
*NL*
very
deep
--
for
she
wanted
to
trap
him
into
damaging
revealments
.
Like
*NL*
many
other
simple-hearted
souls
,
it
was
her
pet
vanity
to
believe
she
*NL*
was
endowed
with
a
talent
for
dark
and
mysterious
diplomacy
,
and
she
*NL*
loved
to
contemplate
her
most
transparent
devices
as
marvels
of
low
*NL*
cunning
.
Said
she
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
it
was
middling
warm
in
school
,
war
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Powerful
warm
,
war
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
you
want
to
go
in
a-swimming
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
bit
of
a
scare
shot
through
Tom
--
a
touch
of
uncomfortable
suspicion
.
He
*NL*
searched
Aunt
Polly
's
face
,
but
it
told
him
nothing
.
So
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
'm
--
well
,
not
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
reached
out
her
hand
and
felt
Tom
's
shirt
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ai
n't
too
warm
now
,
though
.
''
And
it
flattered
her
to
reflect
*NL*
that
she
had
discovered
that
the
shirt
was
dry
without
anybody
knowing
*NL*
that
that
was
what
she
had
in
her
mind
.
But
in
spite
of
her
,
Tom
knew
*NL*
where
the
wind
lay
,
now
.
So
he
forestalled
what
might
be
the
next
move
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
of
us
pumped
on
our
heads
--
mine
's
damp
yet
.
See
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Polly
was
vexed
to
think
she
had
overlooked
that
bit
of
*NL*
circumstantial
evidence
,
and
missed
a
trick
.
Then
she
had
a
new
*NL*
inspiration
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
you
did
n't
have
to
undo
your
shirt
collar
where
I
sewed
it
,
to
*NL*
pump
on
your
head
,
did
you
?
Unbutton
your
jacket
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trouble
vanished
out
of
Tom
's
face
.
He
opened
his
jacket
.
His
shirt
*NL*
collar
was
securely
sewed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bother
!
Well
,
go
`
long
with
you
.
I
'd
made
sure
you
'd
played
hookey
*NL*
and
been
a-swimming
.
But
I
forgive
ye
,
Tom
.
I
reckon
you
're
a
kind
of
a
*NL*
singed
cat
,
as
the
saying
is
--
better
'n
you
look
.
_
This
_
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
half
sorry
her
sagacity
had
miscarried
,
and
half
glad
that
Tom
*NL*
had
stumbled
into
obedient
conduct
for
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Sidney
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
if
I
did
n't
think
you
sewed
his
collar
with
white
thread
,
*NL*
but
it
's
black
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
did
sew
it
with
white
!
Tom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
did
not
wait
for
the
rest
.
As
he
went
out
at
the
door
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Siddy
,
I
'll
lick
you
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
safe
place
Tom
examined
two
large
needles
which
were
thrust
into
*NL*
the
lapels
of
his
jacket
,
and
had
thread
bound
about
them
--
one
needle
*NL*
carried
white
thread
and
the
other
black
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
never
noticed
if
it
had
n't
been
for
Sid
.
Confound
it
!
sometimes
*NL*
she
sews
it
with
white
,
and
sometimes
she
sews
it
with
black
.
I
wish
to
*NL*
gee-miny
she
'd
stick
to
one
or
t
`
other
--
I
ca
n't
keep
the
run
of
'em
.
But
*NL*
I
bet
you
I
'll
lam
Sid
for
that
.
I
'll
learn
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
the
Model
Boy
of
the
village
.
He
knew
the
model
boy
very
well
*NL*
though
--
and
loathed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
two
minutes
,
or
even
less
,
he
had
forgotten
all
his
troubles
.
Not
*NL*
because
his
troubles
were
one
whit
less
heavy
and
bitter
to
him
than
a
*NL*
man
's
are
to
a
man
,
but
because
a
new
and
powerful
interest
bore
*NL*
them
down
and
drove
them
out
of
his
mind
for
the
time
--
just
as
men
's
*NL*
misfortunes
are
forgotten
in
the
excitement
of
new
enterprises
.
This
new
*NL*
interest
was
a
valued
novelty
in
whistling
,
which
he
had
just
acquired
*NL*
from
a
negro
,
and
he
was
suffering
to
practise
it
un-disturbed
.
It
*NL*
consisted
in
a
peculiar
bird-like
turn
,
a
sort
of
liquid
warble
,
*NL*
produced
by
touching
the
tongue
to
the
roof
of
the
mouth
at
short
*NL*
intervals
in
the
midst
of
the
music
--
the
reader
probably
remembers
how
to
*NL*
do
it
,
if
he
has
ever
been
a
boy
.
Diligence
and
attention
soon
gave
him
*NL*
the
knack
of
it
,
and
he
strode
down
the
street
with
his
mouth
full
of
*NL*
harmony
and
his
soul
full
of
gratitude
.
He
felt
much
as
an
astronomer
*NL*
feels
who
has
discovered
a
new
planet
--
no
doubt
,
as
far
as
strong
,
deep
,
*NL*
unalloyed
pleasure
is
concerned
,
the
advantage
was
with
the
boy
,
not
the
*NL*
astronomer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
summer
evenings
were
long
.
It
was
not
dark
,
yet
.
Presently
Tom
*NL*
checked
his
whistle
.
A
stranger
was
before
him
--
a
boy
a
shade
larger
*NL*
than
himself
.
A
new-comer
of
any
age
or
either
sex
was
an
im-pressive
*NL*
curiosity
in
the
poor
little
shabby
village
of
St.
Petersburg
.
This
boy
*NL*
was
well
dressed
,
too
--
well
dressed
on
a
week-day
.
This
was
simply
as
*NL*
astounding
.
His
cap
was
a
dainty
thing
,
his
close-buttoned
blue
cloth
*NL*
roundabout
was
new
and
natty
,
and
so
were
his
pantaloons
.
He
had
shoes
*NL*
on
--
and
it
was
only
Friday
.
He
even
wore
a
necktie
,
a
bright
bit
of
*NL*
ribbon
.
He
had
a
citified
air
about
him
that
ate
into
Tom
's
vitals
.
The
*NL*
more
Tom
stared
at
the
splendid
marvel
,
the
higher
he
turned
up
his
nose
*NL*
at
his
finery
and
the
shabbier
and
shabbier
his
own
outfit
seemed
to
*NL*
him
to
grow
.
Neither
boy
spoke
.
If
one
moved
,
the
other
moved
--
but
only
*NL*
sidewise
,
in
a
circle
;
they
kept
face
to
face
and
eye
to
eye
all
the
*NL*
time
.
Finally
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
lick
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
like
to
see
you
try
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
can
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
you
ca
n't
,
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
you
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
uncomfortable
pause
.
Then
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
n't
any

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

*NL*
*NL*
``

There
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
one
hand
tied
behind
me
,
if
I
wanted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
why
do
n't

_
do

You

say

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

will

fool
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

``

and

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aw

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

if
you
give
me
much
more
of

'll
take
and
bounce

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

you
will

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
I
_

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
why

do

it

Why

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
pause
,
and
more
eying
and
sidling
around
each
other
.
Presently
*NL*
they
were
shoulder
to
shoulder
.
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
away
from
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
yourself

*NL*

``
I
wo

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
stood
,
each
with
a
foot
placed
at
an
angle
as
a
brace
,
and
both
*NL*
shoving
with
might
and
main
,
and
glowering
at
each
other
with
hate
.
But
*NL*
neither
could
get
an
advantage
.
After
struggling
till
both
were
hot
and
*NL*
flushed
,
each
relaxed
his
strain
with
watchful
caution
,
and
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
coward

pup

I
'll
tell
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do

care
for

I
've

*NL*

Both
brothers
were
imaginary

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a

''
_
Your

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
drew
a
line
in
the
dust
with
his
big
toe
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
you

*NL*
The
new

stepped
over
promptly

and
said

Now

The
new
boy
took
two
broad
coppers
out
of
his
pocket
and
held
them
out
*NL*
with
derision
.
Tom
struck
them
to
the
ground
.
In
an
instant
both
boys
*NL*
were
rolling
and
tumbling
in
the
dirt
,
gripped
together
like
cats
;
and
*NL*
for
the
space
of
a
minute
they
tugged
and
tore
at
each
other
's
hair
and
*NL*
clothes
,
punched
and
scratched
each
other
's
nose
,
and
covered
themselves
*NL*
with
dust
and
glory
.
Presently
the
confusion
took
form
,
and
through
the
*NL*
fog
of
battle
Tom
appeared
,
seated
astride
the
new
boy
,
and
pounding
him
*NL*
with
his
fists
.
``
Holler
`
nuff
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
only
struggled
to
free
himself
.
He
was
crying
--
mainly
from
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Holler
`
nuff
!
''
--
and
the
pounding
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
stranger
got
out
a
smothered
''
`
Nuff
!
''
and
Tom
let
him
up
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
'll
learn
you
.
Better
look
out
who
you
're
fooling
with
next
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
boy
went
off
brushing
the
dust
from
his
clothes
,
sobbing
,
*NL*
snuffling
,
and
occasionally
looking
back
and
shaking
his
head
and
*NL*
threatening
what
he
would
do
to
Tom
the
``
next
time
he
caught
him
out
.
''
*NL*
To
which
Tom
responded
with
jeers
,
and
started
off
in
high
feather
,
and
*NL*
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
the
new
boy
snatched
up
a
stone
,
threw
it
*NL*
and
hit
him
between
the
shoulders
and
then
turned
tail
and
ran
like
*NL*
an
antelope
.
Tom
chased
the
traitor
home
,
and
thus
found
out
where
he
*NL*
lived
.
He
then
held
a
position
at
the
gate
for
some
time
,
daring
the
*NL*
enemy
to
come
outside
,
but
the
enemy
only
made
faces
at
him
through
the
*NL*
window
and
declined
.
At
last
the
enemy
's
mother
appeared
,
and
called
Tom
*NL*
a
bad
,
vicious
,
vulgar
child
,
and
ordered
him
away
.
So
he
went
away
;
but
*NL*
he
said
he
''
`
lowed
''
to
``
lay
''
for
that
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
home
pretty
late
that
night
,
and
when
he
climbed
cautiously
in
*NL*
at
the
window
,
he
uncovered
an
ambuscade
,
in
the
person
of
his
aunt
;
and
*NL*
when
she
saw
the
state
his
clothes
were
in
her
resolution
to
turn
his
*NL*
Saturday
holiday
into
captivity
at
hard
labor
became
adamantine
in
its
*NL*
firmness
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
SATURDAY
morning
was
come
,
and
all
the
summer
world
was
bright
and
*NL*
fresh
,
and
brimming
with
life
.
There
was
a
song
in
every
heart
;
and
if
*NL*
the
heart
was
young
the
music
issued
at
the
lips
.
There
was
cheer
in
*NL*
every
face
and
a
spring
in
every
step
.
The
locust-trees
were
in
bloom
*NL*
and
the
fragrance
of
the
blossoms
filled
the
air
.
Cardiff
Hill
,
beyond
*NL*
the
village
and
above
it
,
was
green
with
vegetation
and
it
lay
just
far
*NL*
enough
away
to
seem
a
Delectable
Land
,
dreamy
,
reposeful
,
and
inviting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
appeared
on
the
sidewalk
with
a
bucket
of
whitewash
and
a
*NL*
long-handled
brush
.
He
surveyed
the
fence
,
and
all
gladness
left
him
and
*NL*
a
deep
melancholy
settled
down
upon
his
spirit
.
Thirty
yards
of
board
*NL*
fence
nine
feet
high
.
Life
to
him
seemed
hollow
,
and
existence
but
a
*NL*
burden
.
Sighing
,
he
dipped
his
brush
and
passed
it
along
the
topmost
*NL*
plank
;
repeated
the
operation
;
did
it
again
;
compared
the
insignificant
*NL*
whitewashed
streak
with
the
far-reaching
continent
of
unwhitewashed
*NL*
fence
,
and
sat
down
on
a
tree-box
discouraged
.
Jim
came
skipping
out
at
*NL*
the
gate
with
a
tin
pail
,
and
singing
Buffalo
Gals
.
Bringing
water
from
*NL*
the
town
pump
had
always
been
hateful
work
in
Tom
's
eyes
,
before
,
but
*NL*
now
it
did
not
strike
him
so
.
He
remembered
that
there
was
company
at
*NL*
the
pump
.
White
,
mulatto
,
and
negro
boys
and
girls
were
always
there
*NL*
waiting
their
turns
,
resting
,
trading
playthings
,
quarrelling
,
fighting
,
*NL*
skylarking
.
And
he
remembered
that
although
the
pump
was
only
a
hundred
*NL*
and
fifty
yards
off
,
Jim
never
got
back
with
a
bucket
of
water
under
an
*NL*
hour
--
and
even
then
somebody
generally
had
to
go
after
him
.
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Jim
,
I
'll
fetch
the
water
if
you
'll
whitewash
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
shook
his
head
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
,
Mars
Tom
.
Ole
missis

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

.

the

*NL*
''
_
She

She
never

with
her

thimble

and
who

that

I

She

awful

but
*NL*
talk
do
n't
hurt

anyways

she
do

.
Jim
,
I
'll
give

a
*NL*
marvel

I
'll
give

a
white
alley

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
began
to
waver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
White
alley
,
Jim
!
And
it
's
a
bully
taw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

But

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
besides
,
if
you
will
I
'll
show

my
sore
toe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
was
only
human
--
this
attraction
was
too
much
for
him
.
He
put
down
*NL*
his
pail
,
took
the
white
alley
,
and
bent
over
the
toe
with
absorbing
*NL*
interest
while
the
bandage
was
being
unwound
.
In
another
moment
he
*NL*
was
flying
down
the
street
with
his
pail
and
a
tingling
rear
,
Tom
was
*NL*
whitewashing
with
vigor
,
and
Aunt
Polly
was
retiring
from
the
field
with
*NL*
a
slipper
in
her
hand
and
triumph
in
her
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
's
energy
did
not
last
.
He
began
to
think
of
the
fun
he
had
*NL*
planned
for
this
day
,
and
his
sorrows
multiplied
.
Soon
the
free
boys
*NL*
would
come
tripping
along
on
all
sorts
of
delicious
expeditions
,
and
*NL*
they
would
make
a
world
of
fun
of
him
for
having
to
work
--
the
very
*NL*
thought
of
it
burnt
him
like
fire
.
He
got
out
his
worldly
wealth
and
*NL*
examined
it
--
bits
of
toys
,
marbles
,
and
trash
;
enough
to
buy
an
exchange
*NL*
of
_
work
_
,
maybe
,
but
not
half
enough
to
buy
so
much
as
half
an
hour
*NL*
of
pure
freedom
.
So
he
returned
his
straitened
means
to
his
pocket
,
and
*NL*
gave
up
the
idea
of
trying
to
buy
the
boys
.
At
this
dark
and
hopeless
*NL*
moment
an
inspiration
burst
upon
him
!
Nothing
less
than
a
great
,
*NL*
magnificent
inspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
his
brush
and
went
tranquilly
to
work
.
Ben
Rogers
hove
in
*NL*
sight
presently
--
the
very
boy
,
of
all
boys
,
whose
ridicule
he
had
been
*NL*
dreading
.
Ben
's
gait
was
the
hop-skip-and-jump
--
proof
enough
that
his
*NL*
heart
was
light
and
his
anticipations
high
.
He
was
eating
an
apple
,
and
*NL*
giving
a
long
,
melodious
whoop
,
at
intervals
,
followed
by
a
deep-toned
*NL*
ding-dong-dong
,
ding-dong-dong
,
for
he
was
personating
a
steamboat
.
As
*NL*
he
drew
near
,
he
slackened
speed
,
took
the
middle
of
the
street
,
leaned
*NL*
far
over
to
starboard
and
rounded
to
ponderously
and
with
laborious
pomp
*NL*
and
circumstance
--
for
he
was
personating
the
Big
Missouri
,
and
considered
*NL*
himself
to
be
drawing
nine
feet
of
water
.
He
was
boat
and
captain
and
*NL*
engine-bells
combined
,
so
he
had
to
imagine
himself
standing
on
his
own
*NL*
hurricane-deck
giving
the
orders
and
executing
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
her
,
sir
!
Ting-a-ling-ling
!
''
The
headway
ran
almost
out
,
and
he
*NL*
drew
up
slowly
toward
the
sidewalk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ship
up
to
back
!
Ting-a-ling-ling
!
''
His
arms
straightened
and
stiffened
*NL*
down
his
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Set
her
back
on
the
stabboard
!
Ting-a-ling-ling
!
Chow
!
ch-chow-wow
!
*NL*
Chow
!
''
His
right
hand
,
mean-time
,
describing
stately
circles
--
for
it
was
*NL*
representing
a
forty-foot
wheel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
go
back
on
the
labboard
!
Ting-a-ling-ling
!
Chow-ch-chow-chow
!
''
*NL*
The
left
hand
began
to
describe
circles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
the
stabboard
!
Ting-a-ling-ling
!
Stop

*NL*
gauge-cocks
-RRB-

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
went
on
whitewashing
--
paid
no
attention
to
the
steamboat
.
Ben
stared
*NL*
a
moment
and
then
said
:
''
_
Hi-Yi
!
You
're
_
up
a
stump
,
ai
n't
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
No
answer
.
Tom
surveyed
his
last
touch
with
the
eye
of
an
artist
,
then
*NL*
he
gave
his
brush
another
gentle
sweep
and
surveyed
the
result
,
as
*NL*
before
.
Ben
ranged
up
alongside
of
him
.
Tom
's
mouth
watered
for
the
*NL*
apple
,
but
he
stuck
to
his
work
.
Ben
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
old
chap

you
got
to
work

hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
wheeled
suddenly
and
said

Why

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
contemplated
the
boy
a
bit
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

ai

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
resumed
his
whitewashing
,
and
answered
carelessly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
maybe
it
is
,
and
maybe

All

``

*NL*
The
brush
continued
to
move
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like

Well

I
do
n't
see

chance

whitewash

every

''
*NL*
*NL*
That
put
the
thing
in
a
new
light
.
Ben
stopped
nibbling
his
apple
.
*NL*
Tom
swept
his
brush
daintily
back
and
forth
--
stepped
back
to
note
the
*NL*
effect
--
added
a
touch
here
and
there
--
criticised
the
effect
again
--
Ben
*NL*
watching
every
move
and
getting
more
and
more
interested
,
more
and
more
*NL*
absorbed
.
Presently
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

Tom
,
let
_
me
_
whitewash

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
considered

was
about
to
consent

he
altered
his
mind
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

no

would

would

Yes

she
's
awful

particular
about
this
fence

it
's
got
to
be
done
very
careful
;
I
reckon
*NL*
there
ai
n't
one
boy
in
a
thousand
,
maybe
two
thousand

that
can
do
it

n't
.
I
'm
afeard

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
give
you
_
all
_
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
gave
up
the
brush
with
reluctance
in
his
face
,
but
alacrity
in
his
*NL*
heart
.
And
while
the
late
steamer
Big
Missouri
worked
and
sweated
in
the
*NL*
sun
,
the
retired
artist
sat
on
a
barrel
in
the
shade
close
by
,
*NL*
dangled
his
legs
,
munched
his
apple
,
and
planned
the
slaughter
of
more
*NL*
innocents
.
There
was
no
lack
of
material
;
boys
happened
along
every
*NL*
little
while
;
they
came
to
jeer
,
but
remained
to
whitewash
.
By
the
time
*NL*
Ben
was
fagged
out
,
Tom
had
traded
the
next
chance
to
Billy
Fisher
for
*NL*
a
kite
,
in
good
repair
;
and
when
he
played
out
,
Johnny
Miller
bought
in
*NL*
for
a
dead
rat
and
a
string
to
swing
it
with
--
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
,
hour
*NL*
after
hour
.
And
when
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
came
,
from
being
a
*NL*
poor
poverty-stricken
boy
in
the
morning
,
Tom
was
literally
rolling
in
*NL*
wealth
.
He
had
besides
the
things
before
mentioned
,
twelve
marbles
,
part
*NL*
of
a
jews-harp
,
a
piece
of
blue
bottle-glass
to
look
through
,
a
spool
*NL*
cannon
,
a
key
that
would
n't
unlock
anything
,
a
fragment
of
chalk
,
a
*NL*
glass
stopper
of
a
decanter
,
a
tin
soldier
,
a
couple
of
tadpoles
,
*NL*
six
fire-crackers
,
a
kitten
with
only
one
eye
,
a
brass
door-knob
,
a
*NL*
dog-collar
--
but
no
dog
--
the
handle
of
a
knife
,
four
pieces
of
orange-peel
,
*NL*
and
a
dilapidated
old
window
sash
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
had
a
nice
,
good
,
idle
time
all
the
while
--
plenty
of
company
--
and
*NL*
the
fence
had
three
coats
of
whitewash
on
it
!
If
he
had
n't
run
out
of
*NL*
whitewash
he
would
have
bankrupted
every
boy
in
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
said
to
himself
that
it
was
not
such
a
hollow
world
,
after
all
.
He
*NL*
had
discovered
a
great
law
of
human
action
,
without
knowing
it
--
namely
,
*NL*
that
in
order
to
make
a
man
or
a
boy
covet
a
thing
,
it
is
only
necessary
*NL*
to
make
the
thing
difficult
to
attain
.
If
he
had
been
a
great
and
*NL*
wise
philosopher
,
like
the
writer
of
this
book
,
he
would
now
have
*NL*
comprehended
that
Work
consists
of
whatever
a
body
is
_
obliged
_
to
do
,
*NL*
and
that
Play
consists
of
whatever
a
body
is
not
obliged
to
do
.
And
*NL*
this
would
help
him
to
understand
why
constructing
artificial
flowers
or
*NL*
performing
on
a
tread-mill
is
work
,
while
rolling
ten-pins
or
climbing
*NL*
Mont
Blanc
is
only
amusement
.
There
are
wealthy
gentlemen
in
England
*NL*
who
drive
four-horse
passenger-coaches
twenty
or
thirty
miles
on
a
*NL*
daily
line
,
in
the
summer
,
because
the
privilege
costs
them
considerable
*NL*
money
;
but
if
they
were
offered
wages
for
the
service
,
that
would
turn
*NL*
it
into
work
and
then
they
would
resign
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
mused
awhile
over
the
substantial
change
which
had
taken
place
*NL*
in
his
worldly
circumstances
,
and
then
wended
toward
headquarters
to
*NL*
report
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
TOM
presented
himself
before
Aunt
Polly
,
who
was
sitting
by
an
*NL*
open
window
in
a
pleasant
rearward
apartment
,
which
was
bedroom
,
*NL*
breakfast-room
,
dining-room
,
and
library
,
combined
.
The
balmy
summer
*NL*
air
,
the
restful
quiet
,
the
odor
of
the
flowers
,
and
the
drowsing
*NL*
murmur
of
the
bees
had
had
their
effect
,
and
she
was
nodding
over
her
*NL*
knitting
--
for
she
had
no
company
but
the
cat
,
and
it
was
asleep
in
her
*NL*
lap
.
Her
spectacles
were
propped
up
on
her
gray
head
for
safety
.
She
had
*NL*
thought
that
of
course
Tom
had
deserted
long
ago
,
and
she
wondered
at
*NL*
seeing
him
place
himself
in
her
power
again
in
this
intrepid
way
.
He
*NL*
said
:
``
May
n't
I
go
and
play
now
,
aunt
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
a
`
ready
?
How
much
have
you
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
done
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
do
n't
lie
to
me
--
I
ca
n't
bear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ai
n't
,
aunt
;
it
_
is
_
all
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Polly
placed
small
trust
in
such
evidence
.
She
went
out
to
see
for
*NL*
herself
;
and
she
would
have
been
content
to
find
twenty
per
cent
.
of
*NL*
Tom
's
statement
true
.
When
she
found
the
entire
fence
white-washed
,
and
*NL*
not
only
whitewashed
but
elaborately
coated
and
recoated
,
and
even
a
*NL*
streak
added
to
the
ground
,
her
astonishment
was
almost
unspeakable
.
She
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
never
!
There
's
no
getting
round
it
,
you
can
work
when
you
're
a
*NL*
mind
to
,
Tom
.
''
And
then
she
diluted
the
compliment
by
adding
,
``
But
it
's
*NL*
powerful
seldom
you
're
a
mind
to
,
I
'm
bound
to
say
.
Well
,
go
`
long
and
*NL*
play
;
but
mind
you
get
back
some
time
in
a
week
,
or
I
'll
tan
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
so
overcome
by
the
splendor
of
his
achievement
that
she
took
*NL*
him
into
the
closet
and
selected
a
choice
apple
and
delivered
it
to
him
,
*NL*
along
with
an
improving
lecture
upon
the
added
value
and
flavor
a
treat
*NL*
took
to
itself
when
it
came
without
sin
through
virtuous
effort
.
*NL*
And
while
she
closed
with
a
happy
Scriptural
flourish
,
he
``
hooked
''
a
*NL*
doughnut
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
skipped
out
,
and
saw
Sid
just
starting
up
the
outside
stairway
*NL*
that
led
to
the
back
rooms
on
the
second
floor
.
Clods
were
handy
and
*NL*
the
air
was
full
of
them
in
a
twinkling
.
They
raged
around
Sid
like
a
*NL*
hail-storm
;
and
before
Aunt
Polly
could
collect
her
surprised
faculties
*NL*
and
sally
to
the
rescue
,
six
or
seven
clods
had
taken
personal
effect
,
*NL*
and
Tom
was
over
the
fence
and
gone
.
There
was
a
gate
,
but
as
a
general
*NL*
thing
he
was
too
crowded
for
time
to
make
use
of
it
.
His
soul
was
at
*NL*
peace
,
now
that
he
had
settled
with
Sid
for
calling
attention
to
his
*NL*
black
thread
and
getting
him
into
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
skirted
the
block
,
and
came
round
into
a
muddy
alley
that
led
by
the
*NL*
back
of
his
aunt
's
cow-stable
.
He
presently
got
safely
beyond
the
reach
*NL*
of
capture
and
punishment
,
and
hastened
toward
the
public
square
of
the
*NL*
village
,
where
two
``
military
''
companies
of
boys
had
met
for
conflict
,
*NL*
according
to
previous
appointment
.
Tom
was
General
of
one
of
these
*NL*
armies
,
Joe
Harper
-LRB-
a
bosom
friend
-RRB-
General
of
the
other
.
These
two
*NL*
great
commanders
did
not
condescend
to
fight
in
person
--
that
being
better
*NL*
suited
to
the
still
smaller
fry
--
but
sat
together
on
an
eminence
*NL*
and
conducted
the
field
operations
by
orders
delivered
through
*NL*
aides-de-camp
.
Tom
's
army
won
a
great
victory
,
after
a
long
and
*NL*
hard-fought
battle
.
Then
the
dead
were
counted
,
prisoners
exchanged
,
*NL*
the
terms
of
the
next
disagreement
agreed
upon
,
and
the
day
for
the
*NL*
necessary
battle
appointed
;
after
which
the
armies
fell
into
line
and
*NL*
marched
away
,
and
Tom
turned
homeward
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
passing
by
the
house
where
Jeff
Thatcher
lived
,
he
saw
a
new
*NL*
girl
in
the
garden
--
a
lovely
little
blue-eyed
creature
with
yellow
*NL*
hair
plaited
into
two
long-tails
,
white
summer
frock
and
embroidered
*NL*
pan-talettes
.
The
fresh-crowned
hero
fell
without
firing
a
shot
.
A
*NL*
certain
Amy
Lawrence
vanished
out
of
his
heart
and
left
not
even
a
*NL*
memory
of
herself
behind
.
He
had
thought
he
loved
her
to
distraction
;
*NL*
he
had
regarded
his
passion
as
adoration
;
and
behold
it
was
only
a
poor
*NL*
little
evanescent
partiality
.
He
had
been
months
winning
her
;
she
had
*NL*
confessed
hardly
a
week
ago
;
he
had
been
the
happiest
and
the
proudest
*NL*
boy
in
the
world
only
seven
short
days
,
and
here
in
one
instant
of
time
*NL*
she
had
gone
out
of
his
heart
like
a
casual
stranger
whose
visit
is
*NL*
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
worshipped
this
new
angel
with
furtive
eye
,
till
he
saw
that
she
had
*NL*
discovered
him
;
then
he
pretended
he
did
not
know
she
was
present
,
and
*NL*
began
to
``
show
off
''
in
all
sorts
of
absurd
boyish
ways
,
in
order
to
win
*NL*
her
admiration
.
He
kept
up
this
grotesque
foolishness
for
some
time
;
*NL*
but
by-and-by
,
while
he
was
in
the
midst
of
some
dangerous
gymnastic
*NL*
performances
,
he
glanced
aside
and
saw
that
the
little
girl
was
wending
*NL*
her
way
toward
the
house
.
Tom
came
up
to
the
fence
and
leaned
on
it
,
*NL*
grieving
,
and
hoping
she
would
tarry
yet
awhile
longer
.
She
halted
a
*NL*
moment
on
the
steps
and
then
moved
toward
the
door
.
Tom
heaved
a
great
*NL*
sigh
as
she
put
her
foot
on
the
threshold
.
But
his
face
lit
up
,
*NL*
right
away
,
for
she
tossed
a
pansy
over
the
fence
a
moment
before
she
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
ran
around
and
stopped
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
flower
,
and
*NL*
then
shaded
his
eyes
with
his
hand
and
began
to
look
down
street
as
*NL*
if
he
had
discovered
something
of
interest
going
on
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
Presently
he
picked
up
a
straw
and
began
trying
to
balance
it
on
his
*NL*
nose
,
with
his
head
tilted
far
back
;
and
as
he
moved
from
side
to
side
,
*NL*
in
his
efforts
,
he
edged
nearer
and
nearer
toward
the
pansy
;
finally
his
*NL*
bare
foot
rested
upon
it
,
his
pliant
toes
closed
upon
it
,
and
he
hopped
*NL*
away
with
the
treasure
and
disappeared
round
the
corner
.
But
only
for
a
*NL*
minute
--
only
while
he
could
button
the
flower
inside
his
jacket
,
next
*NL*
his
heart
--
or
next
his
stomach
,
possibly
,
for
he
was
not
much
posted
in
*NL*
anatomy
,
and
not
hypercritical
,
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
,
now
,
and
hung
about
the
fence
till
nightfall
,
``
showing
*NL*
off
,
''
as
before
;
but
the
girl
never
exhibited
herself
again
,
though
Tom
*NL*
comforted
himself
a
little
with
the
hope
that
she
had
been
near
some
*NL*
window
,
meantime
,
and
been
aware
of
his
attentions
.
Finally
he
strode
*NL*
home
reluctantly
,
with
his
poor
head
full
of
visions
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
through
supper
his
spirits
were
so
high
that
his
aunt
wondered
``
what
*NL*
had
got
into
the
child
.
''
He
took
a
good
scolding
about
clodding
Sid
,
and
*NL*
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
in
the
least
.
He
tried
to
steal
sugar
under
his
*NL*
aunt
's
very
nose
,
and
got
his
knuckles
rapped
for
it
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
,
you
do
n't
whack
Sid
when
he
takes
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Sid
do
n't
torment
a
body
the
way
you
do
.
You
'd
be
always
into
*NL*
that
sugar
if
I
war
n't
watching
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
stepped
into
the
kitchen
,
and
Sid
,
happy
in
his
immunity
,
*NL*
reached
for
the
sugar-bowl
--
a
sort
of
glorying
over
Tom
which
was
*NL*
wellnigh
unbearable
.
But
Sid
's
fingers
slipped
and
the
bowl
dropped
and
*NL*
broke
.
Tom
was
in
ecstasies
.
In
such
ecstasies
that
he
even
controlled
*NL*
his
tongue
and
was
silent
.
He
said
to
himself
that
he
would
not
speak
a
*NL*
word
,
even
when
his
aunt
came
in
,
but
would
sit
perfectly
still
till
she
*NL*
asked
who
did
the
mischief
;
and
then
he
would
tell
,
and
there
would
be
*NL*
nothing
so
good
in
the
world
as
to
see
that
pet
model
``
catch
it
.
''
He
was
*NL*
so
brimful
of
exultation
that
he
could
hardly
hold
himself
when
the
old
*NL*
lady
came
back
and
stood
above
the
wreck
discharging
lightnings
of
wrath
*NL*
from
over
her
spectacles
.
He
said
to
himself
,
``
Now
it
's
coming
!
''
And
the
*NL*
next
instant
he
was
sprawling
on
the
floor
!
The
potent
palm
was
uplifted
*NL*
to
strike
again
when
Tom
cried
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
,
now
,
what
`
er
you
belting
_
me
_
for
?
--
Sid
broke
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Polly
paused
,
perplexed
,
and
Tom
looked
for
healing
pity
.
But
when
*NL*
she
got
her
tongue
again
,
she
only
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Umf
!
Well
,
you
did
n't
get
a
lick
amiss
,
I
reckon
.
You
been
into
some
*NL*
other
audacious
mischief
when
I
was
n't
around
,
like
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
her
conscience
reproached
her
,
and
she
yearned
to
say
something
*NL*
kind
and
loving
;
but
she
judged
that
this
would
be
construed
into
a
*NL*
confession
that
she
had
been
in
the
wrong
,
and
discipline
forbade
that
.
*NL*
So
she
kept
silence
,
and
went
about
her
affairs
with
a
troubled
heart
.
*NL*
Tom
sulked
in
a
corner
and
exalted
his
woes
.
He
knew
that
in
her
heart
*NL*
his
aunt
was
on
her
knees
to
him
,
and
he
was
morosely
gratified
by
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
it
.
He
would
hang
out
no
signals
,
he
would
take
notice
*NL*
of
none
.
He
knew
that
a
yearning
glance
fell
upon
him
,
now
and
then
,
*NL*
through
a
film
of
tears
,
but
he
refused
recognition
of
it
.
He
pictured
*NL*
himself
lying
sick
unto
death
and
his
aunt
bending
over
him
beseeching
*NL*
one
little
forgiving
word
,
but
he
would
turn
his
face
to
the
wall
,
and
*NL*
die
with
that
word
unsaid
.
Ah
,
how
would
she
feel
then
?
And
he
pictured
*NL*
himself
brought
home
from
the
river
,
dead
,
with
his
curls
all
wet
,
and
*NL*
his
sore
heart
at
rest
.
How
she
would
throw
herself
upon
him
,
and
how
*NL*
her
tears
would
fall
like
rain
,
and
her
lips
pray
God
to
give
her
back
*NL*
her
boy
and
she
would
never
,
never
abuse
him
any
more
!
But
he
would
*NL*
lie
there
cold
and
white
and
make
no
sign
--
a
poor
little
sufferer
,
whose
*NL*
griefs
were
at
an
end
.
He
so
worked
upon
his
feelings
with
the
pathos
of
*NL*
these
dreams
,
that
he
had
to
keep
swallowing
,
he
was
so
like
to
choke
;
*NL*
and
his
eyes
swam
in
a
blur
of
water
,
which
overflowed
when
he
winked
,
*NL*
and
ran
down
and
trickled
from
the
end
of
his
nose
.
And
such
a
luxury
to
*NL*
him
was
this
petting
of
his
sorrows
,
that
he
could
not
bear
to
have
any
*NL*
worldly
cheeriness
or
any
grating
delight
intrude
upon
it
;
it
was
too
*NL*
sacred
for
such
contact
;
and
so
,
presently
,
when
his
cousin
Mary
danced
*NL*
in
,
all
alive
with
the
joy
of
seeing
home
again
after
an
age-long
visit
*NL*
of
one
week
to
the
country
,
he
got
up
and
moved
in
clouds
and
darkness
*NL*
out
at
one
door
as
she
brought
song
and
sunshine
in
at
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wandered
far
from
the
accustomed
haunts
of
boys
,
and
sought
desolate
*NL*
places
that
were
in
harmony
with
his
spirit
.
A
log
raft
in
the
river
*NL*
invited
him
,
and
he
seated
himself
on
its
outer
edge
and
contemplated
*NL*
the
dreary
vastness
of
the
stream
,
wishing
,
the
while
,
that
he
could
*NL*
only
be
drowned
,
all
at
once
and
unconsciously
,
without
undergoing
the
*NL*
uncomfortable
routine
devised
by
nature
.
Then
he
thought
of
his
flower
.
*NL*
He
got
it
out
,
rumpled
and
wilted
,
and
it
mightily
increased
his
dismal
*NL*
felicity
.
He
wondered
if
she
would
pity
him
if
she
knew
?
Would
she
*NL*
cry
,
and
wish
that
she
had
a
right
to
put
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
*NL*
comfort
him
?
Or
would
she
turn
coldly
away
like
all
the
hollow
world
?
*NL*
This
picture
brought
such
an
agony
of
pleasurable
suffering
that
he
*NL*
worked
it
over
and
over
again
in
his
mind
and
set
it
up
in
new
and
*NL*
varied
lights
,
till
he
wore
it
threadbare
.
At
last
he
rose
up
sighing
*NL*
and
departed
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
half-past
nine
or
ten
o'clock
he
came
along
the
deserted
street
to
*NL*
where
the
Adored
Unknown
lived
;
he
paused
a
moment
;
no
sound
fell
upon
*NL*
his
listening
ear
;
a
candle
was
casting
a
dull
glow
upon
the
curtain
*NL*
of
a
second-story
window
.
Was
the
sacred
presence
there
?
He
climbed
the
*NL*
fence
,
threaded
his
stealthy
way
through
the
plants
,
till
he
stood
under
*NL*
that
window
;
he
looked
up
at
it
long
,
and
with
emotion
;
then
he
laid
him
*NL*
down
on
the
ground
under
it
,
disposing
himself
upon
his
back
,
with
his
*NL*
hands
clasped
upon
his
breast
and
holding
his
poor
wilted
flower
.
*NL*
And
thus
he
would
die
--
out
in
the
cold
world
,
with
no
shelter
over
his
*NL*
homeless
head
,
no
friendly
hand
to
wipe
the
death-damps
from
his
brow
,
*NL*
no
loving
face
to
bend
pityingly
over
him
when
the
great
agony
came
.
And
*NL*
thus
_
she
_
would
see
him
when
she
looked
out
upon
the
glad
morning
,
and
*NL*
oh
!
would
she
drop
one
little
tear
upon
his
poor
,
lifeless
form
,
would
*NL*
she
heave
one
little
sigh
to
see
a
bright
young
life
so
rudely
blighted
,
*NL*
so
untimely
cut
down
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
window
went
up
,
a
maid-servant
's
discordant
voice
profaned
the
holy
*NL*
calm
,
and
a
deluge
of
water
drenched
the
prone
martyr
's
remains
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
strangling
hero
sprang
up
with
a
relieving
snort
.
There
was
a
whiz
*NL*
as
of
a
missile
in
the
air
,
mingled
with
the
murmur
of
a
curse
,
a
sound
*NL*
as
of
shivering
glass
followed
,
and
a
small
,
vague
form
went
over
the
*NL*
fence
and
shot
away
in
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
,
as
Tom
,
all
undressed
for
bed
,
was
surveying
his
*NL*
drenched
garments
by
the
light
of
a
tallow
dip
,
Sid
woke
up
;
but
if
he
*NL*
had
any
dim
idea
of
making
any
``
references
to
allusions
,
''
he
thought
*NL*
better
of
it
and
held
his
peace
,
for
there
was
danger
in
Tom
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
turned
in
without
the
added
vexation
of
prayers
,
and
Sid
made
mental
*NL*
note
of
the
omission
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
sun
rose
upon
a
tranquil
world
,
and
beamed
down
upon
the
peaceful
*NL*
village
like
a
benediction
.
Breakfast
over
,
Aunt
Polly
had
family
*NL*
worship
:
it
began
with
a
prayer
built
from
the
ground
up
of
solid
*NL*
courses
of
Scriptural
quotations
,
welded
together
with
a
thin
mortar
of
*NL*
originality
;
and
from
the
summit
of
this
she
delivered
a
grim
chapter
of
*NL*
the
Mosaic
Law
,
as
from
Sinai
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Tom
girded
up
his
loins
,
so
to
speak
,
and
went
to
work
to
``
get
*NL*
his
verses
.
''
Sid
had
learned
his
lesson
days
before
.
Tom
bent
all
his
*NL*
energies
to
the
memorizing
of
five
verses
,
and
he
chose
part
of
the
*NL*
Sermon
on
the
Mount
,
because
he
could
find
no
verses
that
were
shorter
.
*NL*
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
Tom
had
a
vague
general
idea
of
his
lesson
,
*NL*
but
no
more
,
for
his
mind
was
traversing
the
whole
field
of
human
*NL*
thought
,
and
his
hands
were
busy
with
distracting
recreations
.
Mary
took
*NL*
his
book
to
hear
him
recite
,
and
he
tried
to
find
his
way
through
the
*NL*
fog
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blessed

the
--
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

--
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

Blessed

the
poor

,
for

is
the
kingdom
*NL*
of

.
Blessed

they

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Shall
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Why
do
n't
you
tell
me
,
Mary
?
--
what
do
you
want
to
*NL*
be
so
mean
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
you
poor
thick-headed
thing
,
I
'm
not
teasing
you
.
I
would
n't
*NL*
do
that
.
You
must
go
and
learn
it
again
.
Do
n't
you
be
discouraged
,
Tom
,
*NL*
you
'll
manage
it
--
and
if
you
do
,
I
'll
give

something
ever
so
nice
.
*NL*
There
,
now
,
that
's
a
good
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
!
What
is
it
,
Mary
,
tell
me
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
you
mind
,
Tom
.
You
know
if
I
say
it
's

,
it
is
nice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
you
that
's
so
,
Mary
.
All
right
,
I
'll
tackle
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
did
``
tackle
it
again
''
--
and
under
the
double
pressure
of
curiosity
*NL*
and
prospective
gain
he
did
it
with
such
spirit
that
he
accomplished
a
*NL*
shining
success
.
Mary
gave
him
a
brand-new
``
Barlow
''
knife
worth
twelve
*NL*
and
a
half
cents
;
and
the
convulsion
of
delight
that
swept
his
system
*NL*
shook
him
to
his
foundations
.
True
,
the
knife
would
not
cut
anything
,
*NL*
but
it
was
a
``
sure-enough
''
Barlow
,
and
there
was
inconceivable
grandeur
*NL*
in
that
--
though
where
the
Western
boys
ever
got
the
idea
that
such
a
*NL*
weapon
could
possibly
be
counterfeited
to
its
injury
is
an
imposing
*NL*
mystery
and
will
always
remain
so
,
perhaps
.
Tom
contrived
to
scarify
the
*NL*
cupboard
with
it
,
and
was
arranging
to
begin
on
the
bureau
,
when
he
was
*NL*
called
off
to
dress
for
Sunday-school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
gave
him
a
tin
basin
of
water
and
a
piece
of
soap
,
and
he
went
*NL*
outside
the
door
and
set
the
basin
on
a
little
bench
there
;
then
he
*NL*
dipped
the
soap
in
the
water
and
laid
it
down
;
turned
up
his
sleeves
;
*NL*
poured
out
the
water
on
the
ground
,
gently
,
and
then
entered
the
kitchen
*NL*
and
began
to
wipe
his
face
diligently
on
the
towel
behind
the
door
.
But
*NL*
Mary
removed
the
towel
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
ai
n't
you
ashamed
,
Tom
.
You
must
n't
be
so
bad
.
Water
wo
n't
hurt
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
a
trifle
disconcerted
.
The
basin
was
refilled
,
and
this
time
he
*NL*
stood
over
it
a
little
while
,
gathering
resolution
;
took
in
a
big
breath
*NL*
and
began
.
When
he
entered
the
kitchen
presently
,
with
both
eyes
shut
*NL*
and
groping
for
the
towel
with
his
hands
,
an
honorable
testimony
of
*NL*
suds
and
water
was
dripping
from
his
face
.
But
when
he
emerged
from
*NL*
the
towel
,
he
was
not
yet
satisfactory
,
for
the
clean
territory
stopped
*NL*
short
at
his
chin
and
his
jaws
,
like
a
mask
;
below
and
beyond
this
line
*NL*
there
was
a
dark
expanse
of
unirrigated
soil
that
spread
downward
in
*NL*
front
and
backward
around
his
neck
.
Mary
took
him
in
hand
,
and
when
she
*NL*
was
done
with
him
he
was
a
man
and
a
brother
,
without
distinction
of
*NL*
color
,
and
his
saturated
hair
was
neatly
brushed
,
and
its
short
curls
*NL*
wrought
into
a
dainty
and
symmetrical
general
effect
.
-LSB-
He
privately
*NL*
smoothed
out
the
curls
,
with
labor
and
difficulty
,
and
plastered
his
*NL*
hair
close
down
to
his
head
;
for
he
held
curls
to
be
effeminate
,
and
his
*NL*
own
filled
his
life
with
bitterness
.
-RSB-
Then
Mary
got
out
a
suit
of
his
*NL*
clothing
that
had
been
used
only
on
Sundays
during
two
years
--
they
were
*NL*
simply
called
his
``
other
clothes
''
--
and
so
by
that
we
know
the
size
of
his
*NL*
wardrobe
.
The
girl
``
put
him
to
rights
''
after
he
had
dressed
himself
;
*NL*
she
buttoned
his
neat
roundabout
up
to
his
chin
,
turned
his
vast
shirt
*NL*
collar
down
over
his
shoulders
,
brushed
him
off
and
crowned
him
with
*NL*
his
speckled
straw
hat
.
He
now
looked
exceedingly
improved
and
*NL*
uncomfortable
.
He
was
fully
as
uncomfortable
as
he
looked
;
for
there
*NL*
was
a
restraint
about
whole
clothes
and
cleanliness
that
galled
him
.
He
*NL*
hoped
that
Mary
would
forget
his
shoes
,
but
the
hope
was
blighted
;
she
*NL*
coated
them
thoroughly
with
tallow
,
as
was
the
custom
,
and
brought
*NL*
them
out
.
He
lost
his
temper
and
said
he
was
always
being
made
to
do
*NL*
everything
he
did
n't
want
to
do
.
But
Mary
said
,
persuasively
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
Tom
--
that
's
a
good
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
got
into
the
shoes
snarling
.
Mary
was
soon
ready
,
and
the
three
*NL*
children
set
out
for
Sunday-school
--
a
place
that
Tom
hated
with
his
whole
*NL*
heart
;
but
Sid
and
Mary
were
fond
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sabbath-school
hours
were
from
nine
to
half-past
ten
;
and
then
church
*NL*
service
.
Two
of
the
children
always
remained
for
the
sermon
voluntarily
,
*NL*
and
the
other
always
remained
too
--
for
stronger
reasons
.
The
church
's
*NL*
high-backed
,
uncushioned
pews
would
seat
about
three
hundred
persons
;
*NL*
the
edifice
was
but
a
small
,
plain
affair
,
with
a
sort
of
pine
board
*NL*
tree-box
on
top
of
it
for
a
steeple
.
At
the
door
Tom
dropped
back
a
step
*NL*
and
accosted
a
Sunday-dressed
comrade
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Billy
,
got
a
yaller
ticket
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
'll
you
take
for
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
'll
you
give
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Piece
of
lickrish
and
a
fish-hook
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Less
see
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
exhibited
.
They
were
satisfactory
,
and
the
property
changed
hands
.
*NL*
Then
Tom
traded
a
couple
of
white
alleys
for
three
red
tickets
,
and
some
*NL*
small
trifle
or
other
for
a
couple
of
blue
ones
.
He
waylaid
other
*NL*
boys
as
they
came
,
and
went
on
buying
tickets
of
various
colors
ten
*NL*
or
fifteen
minutes
longer
.
He
entered
the
church
,
now
,
with
a
swarm
*NL*
of
clean
and
noisy
boys
and
girls
,
proceeded
to
his
seat
and
started
*NL*
a
quarrel
with
the
first
boy
that
came
handy
.
The
teacher
,
a
grave
,
*NL*
elderly
man
,
interfered
;
then
turned
his
back
a
moment
and
Tom
pulled
a
*NL*
boy
's
hair
in
the
next
bench
,
and
was
absorbed
in
his
book
when
the
boy
*NL*
turned
around
;
stuck
a
pin
in
another
boy
,
presently
,
in
order
to
hear
*NL*
him
say
``
Ouch
!
''
and
got
a
new
reprimand
from
his
teacher
.
Tom
's
whole
*NL*
class
were
of
a
pattern
--
restless
,
noisy
,
and
troublesome
.
When
they
came
*NL*
to
recite
their
lessons
,
not
one
of
them
knew
his
verses
perfectly
,
but
*NL*
had
to
be
prompted
all
along
.
However
,
they
worried
through
,
and
each
*NL*
got
his
reward
--
in
small
blue
tickets
,
each
with
a
passage
of
Scripture
*NL*
on
it
;
each
blue
ticket
was
pay
for
two
verses
of
the
recitation
.
Ten
*NL*
blue
tickets
equalled
a
red
one
,
and
could
be
exchanged
for
it
;
ten
red
*NL*
tickets
equalled
a
yellow
one
;
for
ten
yellow
tickets
the
superintendent
*NL*
gave
a
very
plainly
bound
Bible
-LRB-
worth
forty
cents
in
those
easy
*NL*
times
-RRB-
to
the
pupil
.
How
many
of
my
readers
would
have
the
industry
and
*NL*
application
to
memorize
two
thousand
verses
,
even
for
a
Dore
Bible
?
And
*NL*
yet
Mary
had
acquired
two
Bibles
in
this
way
--
it
was
the
patient
work
of
*NL*
two
years
--
and
a
boy
of
German
parentage
had
won
four
or
five
.
He
once
*NL*
recited
three
thousand
verses
without
stopping
;
but
the
strain
upon
his
*NL*
mental
faculties
was
too
great
,
and
he
was
little
better
than
an
idiot
*NL*
from
that
day
forth
--
a
grievous
misfortune
for
the
school
,
for
on
great
*NL*
occasions
,
before
company
,
the
superintendent
-LRB-
as
Tom
expressed
it
-RRB-
*NL*
had
always
made
this
boy
come
out
and
``
spread
himself
.
''
Only
the
older
*NL*
pupils
managed
to
keep
their
tickets
and
stick
to
their
tedious
work
*NL*
long
enough
to
get
a
Bible
,
and
so
the
delivery
of
one
of
these
prizes
*NL*
was
a
rare
and
noteworthy
circumstance
;
the
successful
pupil
was
so
*NL*
great
and
conspicuous
for
that
day
that
on
the
spot
every
scholar
's
*NL*
heart
was
fired
with
a
fresh
ambition
that
often
lasted
a
couple
*NL*
of
weeks
.
It
is
possible
that
Tom
's
mental
stomach
had
never
really
*NL*
hungered
for
one
of
those
prizes
,
but
unquestionably
his
entire
being
*NL*
had
for
many
a
day
longed
for
the
glory
and
the
eclat
that
came
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
due
course
the
superintendent
stood
up
in
front
of
the
pulpit
,
with
*NL*
a
closed
hymn-book
in
his
hand
and
his
forefinger
inserted
between
its
*NL*
leaves
,
and
commanded
attention
.
When
a
Sunday-school
superintendent
*NL*
makes
his
customary
little
speech
,
a
hymn-book
in
the
hand
is
as
*NL*
necessary
as
is
the
inevitable
sheet
of
music
in
the
hand
of
a
singer
*NL*
who
stands
forward
on
the
platform
and
sings
a
solo
at
a
concert
--
though
*NL*
why
,
is
a
mystery
:
for
neither
the
hymn-book
nor
the
sheet
of
music
*NL*
is
ever
referred
to
by
the
sufferer
.
This
superintendent
was
a
slim
*NL*
creature
of
thirty-five
,
with
a
sandy
goatee
and
short
sandy
hair
;
he
*NL*
wore
a
stiff
standing-collar
whose
upper
edge
almost
reached
his
ears
*NL*
and
whose
sharp
points
curved
forward
abreast
the
corners
of
his
mouth
--
a
*NL*
fence
that
compelled
a
straight
lookout
ahead
,
and
a
turning
of
the
*NL*
whole
body
when
a
side
view
was
required
;
his
chin
was
propped
on
a
*NL*
spreading
cravat
which
was
as
broad
and
as
long
as
a
bank-note
,
and
had
*NL*
fringed
ends
;
his
boot
toes
were
turned
sharply
up
,
in
the
fashion
*NL*
of
the
day
,
like
sleigh-runners
--
an
effect
patiently
and
laboriously
*NL*
produced
by
the
young
men
by
sitting
with
their
toes
pressed
against
a
*NL*
wall
for
hours
together
.
Mr.
Walters
was
very
earnest
of
mien
,
and
very
*NL*
sincere
and
honest
at
heart
;
and
he
held
sacred
things
and
places
*NL*
in
such
reverence
,
and
so
separated
them
from
worldly
matters
,
that
*NL*
unconsciously
to
himself
his
Sunday-school
voice
had
acquired
a
peculiar
*NL*
intonation
which
was
wholly
absent
on
week-days
.
He
began
after
this
*NL*
fashion
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
children
,
I
want
you
all
to
sit
up
just
as
straight
and
pretty
as
*NL*
you
can
and
give
me
all
your
attention
for
a
minute
or
two
.
There
--
that
*NL*
is
it
.
That
is
the
way
good
little
boys
and
girls
should
do
.
I
see
one
*NL*
little
girl
who
is
looking
out
of
the
window
--
I
am
afraid
she
thinks
I
*NL*
am
out
there
somewhere
--
perhaps
up
in
one
of
the
trees
making
a
speech
*NL*
to
the
little
birds
.
-LSB-
Applausive
titter
.
-RSB-
I
want
to
tell
you
how
good
it
*NL*
makes
me
feel
to
see
so
many
bright
,
clean
little
faces
assembled
in
a
*NL*
place
like
this
,
learning
to
do
right
and
be
good
.
''
And
so
forth
and
so
*NL*
on
.
It
is
not
necessary
to
set
down
the
rest
of
the
oration
.
It
was
of
a
*NL*
pattern
which
does
not
vary
,
and
so
it
is
familiar
to
us
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
third
of
the
speech
was
marred
by
the
resumption
of
fights
*NL*
and
other
recreations
among
certain
of
the
bad
boys
,
and
by
fidgetings
*NL*
and
whisperings
that
extended
far
and
wide
,
washing
even
to
the
bases
of
*NL*
isolated
and
incorruptible
rocks
like
Sid
and
Mary
.
But
now
every
sound
*NL*
ceased
suddenly
,
with
the
subsidence
of
Mr.
Walters
'
voice
,
and
the
*NL*
conclusion
of
the
speech
was
received
with
a
burst
of
silent
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
good
part
of
the
whispering
had
been
occasioned
by
an
event
which
was
*NL*
more
or
less
rare
--
the
entrance
of
visitors
:
lawyer
Thatcher
,
accompanied
*NL*
by
a
very
feeble
and
aged
man
;
a
fine
,
portly
,
middle-aged
gentleman
*NL*
with
iron-gray
hair
;
and
a
dignified
lady
who
was
doubtless
the
latter
's
*NL*
wife
.
The
lady
was
leading
a
child
.
Tom
had
been
restless
and
full
of
*NL*
chafings
and
repinings
;
conscience-smitten
,
too
--
he
could
not
meet
Amy
*NL*
Lawrence
's
eye
,
he
could
not
brook
her
loving
gaze
.
But
when
he
saw
this
*NL*
small
newcomer
his
soul
was
all
ablaze
with
bliss
in
a
moment
.
The
next
*NL*
moment
he
was
``
showing
off
''
with
all
his
might
--
cuffing
boys
,
pulling
*NL*
hair
,
making
faces
--
in
a
word
,
using
every
art
that
seemed
likely
to
*NL*
fascinate
a
girl
and
win
her
applause
.
His
exaltation
had
but
one
*NL*
alloy
--
the
memory
of
his
humiliation
in
this
angel
's
garden
--
and
that
*NL*
record
in
sand
was
fast
washing
out
,
under
the
waves
of
happiness
that
*NL*
were
sweeping
over
it
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visitors
were
given
the
highest
seat
of
honor
,
and
as
soon
as
Mr.
*NL*
Walters
'
speech
was
finished
,
he
introduced
them
to
the
school
.
The
*NL*
middle-aged
man
turned
out
to
be
a
prodigious
personage
--
no
less
a
one
*NL*
than
the
county
judge
--
altogether
the
most
august
creation
these
children
*NL*
had
ever
looked
upon
--
and
they
wondered
what
kind
of
material
he
was
made
*NL*
of
--
and
they
half
wanted
to
hear
him
roar
,
and
were
half
afraid
he
might
,
*NL*
too
.
He
was
from
Constantinople
,
twelve
miles
away
--
so
he
had
travelled
,
*NL*
and
seen
the
world
--
these
very
eyes
had
looked
upon
the
county
*NL*
court-house
--
which
was
said
to
have
a
tin
roof
.
The
awe
which
these
*NL*
reflections
inspired
was
attested
by
the
impressive
silence
and
the
*NL*
ranks
of
staring
eyes
.
This
was
the
great
Judge
Thatcher
,
brother
of
*NL*
their
own
lawyer
.
Jeff
Thatcher
immediately
went
forward
,
to
be
familiar
*NL*
with
the
great
man
and
be
envied
by
the
school
.
It
would
have
been
music
*NL*
to
his
soul
to
hear
the
whisperings
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
him
,
Jim
!
He
's
a
going
up
there
.
Say
--
look
!
he
's
a
going
to
*NL*
shake
hands
with
him
--
he
_
is
_
shaking
hands
with
him
!
By
jings
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
wish
you
was
Jeff
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Walters
fell
to
``
showing
off
,
''
with
all
sorts
of
official
bustlings
*NL*
and
activities
,
giving
orders
,
delivering
judgments
,
discharging
*NL*
directions
here
,
there
,
everywhere
that
he
could
find
a
target
.
The
*NL*
librarian
``
showed
off
''
--
running
hither
and
thither
with
his
arms
full
of
*NL*
books
and
making
a
deal
of
the
splutter
and
fuss
that
insect
authority
*NL*
delights
in
.
The
young
lady
teachers
``
showed
off
''
--
bending
sweetly
over
*NL*
pupils
that
were
lately
being
boxed
,
lifting
pretty
warning
fingers
*NL*
at
bad
little
boys
and
patting
good
ones
lovingly
.
The
young
gentlemen
*NL*
teachers
``
showed
off
''
with
small
scoldings
and
other
little
displays
of
*NL*
authority
and
fine
attention
to
discipline
--
and
most
of
the
teachers
,
of
*NL*
both
sexes
,
found
business
up
at
the
library
,
by
the
pulpit
;
and
it
was
*NL*
business
that
frequently
had
to
be
done
over
again
two
or
three
times
*NL*
-LRB-
with
much
seeming
vexation
-RRB-
.
The
little
girls
``
showed
off
''
in
various
*NL*
ways
,
and
the
little
boys
``
showed
off
''
with
such
diligence
that
the
air
*NL*
was
thick
with
paper
wads
and
the
murmur
of
scufflings
.
And
above
it
*NL*
all
the
great
man
sat
and
beamed
a
majestic
judicial
smile
upon
all
*NL*
the
house
,
and
warmed
himself
in
the
sun
of
his
own
grandeur
--
for
he
was
*NL*
``
showing
off
,
''
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
only
one
thing
wanting
to
make
Mr.
Walters
'
ecstasy
complete
,
*NL*
and
that
was
a
chance
to
deliver
a
Bible-prize
and
exhibit
a
prodigy
.
*NL*
Several
pupils
had
a
few
yellow
tickets
,
but
none
had
enough
--
he
had
been
*NL*
around
among
the
star
pupils
inquiring
.
He
would
have
given
worlds
,
now
,
*NL*
to
have
that
German
lad
back
again
with
a
sound
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
at
this
moment
,
when
hope
was
dead
,
Tom
Sawyer
came
forward
with
*NL*
nine
yellow
tickets
,
nine
red
tickets
,
and
ten
blue
ones
,
and
demanded
*NL*
a
Bible
.
This
was
a
thunderbolt
out
of
a
clear
sky
.
Walters
was
not
*NL*
expecting
an
application
from
this
source
for
the
next
ten
years
.
But
*NL*
there
was
no
getting
around
it
--
here
were
the
certified
checks
,
and
they
*NL*
were
good
for
their
face
.
Tom
was
therefore
elevated
to
a
place
with
*NL*
the
Judge
and
the
other
elect
,
and
the
great
news
was
announced
from
*NL*
headquarters
.
It
was
the
most
stunning
surprise
of
the
decade
,
and
*NL*
so
profound
was
the
sensation
that
it
lifted
the
new
hero
up
to
the
*NL*
judicial
one
's
altitude
,
and
the
school
had
two
marvels
to
gaze
upon
*NL*
in
place
of
one
.
The
boys
were
all
eaten
up
with
envy
--
but
those
that
*NL*
suffered
the
bitterest
pangs
were
those
who
perceived
too
late
that
they
*NL*
themselves
had
contributed
to
this
hated
splendor
by
trading
tickets
to
*NL*
Tom
for
the
wealth
he
had
amassed
in
selling
whitewashing
privileges
.
*NL*
These
despised
themselves
,
as
being
the
dupes
of
a
wily
fraud
,
a
*NL*
guileful
snake
in
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prize
was
delivered
to
Tom
with
as
much
effusion
as
the
*NL*
superintendent
could
pump
up
under
the
circumstances
;
but
it
lacked
*NL*
somewhat
of
the
true
gush
,
for
the
poor
fellow
's
instinct
taught
him
*NL*
that
there
was
a
mystery
here
that
could
not
well
bear
the
light
,
*NL*
perhaps
;
it
was
simply
preposterous
that
this
boy
had
warehoused
two
*NL*
thousand
sheaves
of
Scriptural
wisdom
on
his
premises
--
a
dozen
would
*NL*
strain
his
capacity
,
without
a
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
Lawrence
was
proud
and
glad
,
and
she
tried
to
make
Tom
see
it
in
*NL*
her
face
--
but
he
would
n't
look
.
She
wondered
;
then
she
was
just
a
grain
*NL*
troubled
;
next
a
dim
suspicion
came
and
went
--
came
again
;
she
watched
;
*NL*
a
furtive
glance
told
her
worlds
--
and
then
her
heart
broke
,
and
she
was
*NL*
jealous
,
and
angry
,
and
the
tears
came
and
she
hated
everybody
.
Tom
most
*NL*
of
all
-LRB-
she
thought
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
introduced
to
the
Judge
;
but
his
tongue
was
tied
,
his
breath
*NL*
would
hardly
come
,
his
heart
quaked
--
partly
because
of
the
awful
*NL*
greatness
of
the
man
,
but
mainly
because
he
was
her
parent
.
He
would
*NL*
have
liked
to
fall
down
and
worship
him
,
if
it
were
in
the
dark
.
The
*NL*
Judge
put
his
hand
on
Tom
's
head
and
called
him
a
fine
little
man
,
and
*NL*
asked
him
what
his
name
was
.
The
boy
stammered
,
gasped
,
and
got
it
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
not
Tom
--
it
is
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
it
.
I
thought
there
was
more
to
it
,
maybe
.
That
's
very
well
.
*NL*
But
you
've
another
one
I
daresay
,
and
you
'll
tell
it
to
me
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
the
gentleman
your
other
name
,
Thomas
,
''
said
Walters
,
``
and
say
*NL*
sir
.
You
must
n't
forget
your
manners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomas
Sawyer

*NL*
``
That

day
,
Thomas
,
and
then
you
'll
look
back
and
say
,
It
's
all
owing
to
the
*NL*
precious
Sunday-school
privileges
of
my
boyhood
--
it
's
all
owing
to
*NL*
my
dear
teachers
that
taught
me
to
learn
--
it
's
all
owing
to
the
good
*NL*
superintendent
,
who
encouraged
me
,
and
watched
over
me
,
and
gave
me
a
*NL*
beautiful
Bible
--
a
splendid
elegant
Bible
--
to
keep
and
have
it
all
for
my
*NL*
own
,
always
--
it
's
all
owing
to
right
bringing
up
!
That
is
what
you
will
*NL*
say
,
Thomas
--
and
you
would
n't
take
any
money
for
those
two
thousand
*NL*
verses
--
no
indeed
you
would
n't
.
And
now
you
would
n't
mind
telling
me
and
*NL*
this
lady
some
of
the
things
you
've
learned
--
no
,
I
know
you
would
n't
--
for
*NL*
we
are
proud
of
little
boys
that
learn
.
Now
,
no
doubt
you
know
the
names
*NL*
of
all
the
twelve
disciples
.
Wo
n't
you
tell
us
the
names
of
the
first
*NL*
two
that
were
appointed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
tugging
at
a
button-hole
and
looking
sheepish
.
He
blushed
,
*NL*
now
,
and
his
eyes
fell
.
Mr.
Walters
'
heart
sank
within
him
.
He
said
*NL*
to
himself
,
it
is
not
possible
that
the
boy
can
answer
the
simplest
*NL*
question
--
why
_
did
_
the
Judge
ask
him
?
Yet
he
felt
obliged
to
speak
up
*NL*
and
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Answer
the
gentleman
,
Thomas
--
do
n't
be
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
still
hung
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
know
you
'll
tell
me
,
''
said
the
lady
.
``
The
names

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
ABOUT
half-past
ten
the
cracked
bell
of
the
small
church
began
to
ring
,
*NL*
and
presently
the
people
began
to
gather
for
the
morning
sermon
.
The
*NL*
Sunday-school
children
distributed
themselves
about
the
house
and
*NL*
occupied
pews
with
their
parents
,
so
as
to
be
under
supervision
.
Aunt
*NL*
Polly
came
,
and
Tom
and
Sid
and
Mary
sat
with
her
--
Tom
being
placed
next
*NL*
the
aisle
,
in
order
that
he
might
be
as
far
away
from
the
open
window
*NL*
and
the
seductive
outside
summer
scenes
as
possible
.
The
crowd
filed
up
*NL*
the
aisles
:
the
aged
and
needy
postmaster
,
who
had
seen
better
days
;
*NL*
the
mayor
and
his
wife
--
for
they
had
a
mayor
there
,
among
other
*NL*
unnecessaries
;
the
justice
of
the
peace
;
the
widow
Douglass
,
fair
,
*NL*
smart
,
and
forty
,
a
generous
,
good-hearted
soul
and
well-to-do
,
her
hill
*NL*
mansion
the
only
palace
in
the
town
,
and
the
most
hospitable
and
much
*NL*
the
most
lavish
in
the
matter
of
festivities
that
St.
Petersburg
could
*NL*
boast
;
the
bent
and
venerable
Major
and
Mrs.
Ward
;
lawyer
Riverson
,
the
*NL*
new
notable
from
a
distance
;
next
the
belle
of
the
village
,
followed
by
*NL*
a
troop
of
lawn-clad
and
ribbon-decked
young
heart-breakers
;
then
all
*NL*
the
young
clerks
in
town
in
a
body
--
for
they
had
stood
in
the
vestibule
*NL*
sucking
their
cane-heads
,
a
circling
wall
of
oiled
and
simpering
*NL*
admirers
,
till
the
last
girl
had
run
their
gantlet
;
and
last
of
all
came
*NL*
the
Model
Boy
,
Willie
Mufferson
,
taking
as
heedful
care
of
his
mother
as
*NL*
if
she
were
cut
glass
.
He
always
brought
his
mother
to
church
,
and
was
*NL*
the
pride
of
all
the
matrons
.
The
boys
all
hated
him
,
he
was
so
*NL*
good
.
And
besides
,
he
had
been
``
thrown
up
to
them
''
so
much
.
His
*NL*
white
handkerchief
was
hanging
out
of
his
pocket
behind
,
as
usual
on
*NL*
Sundays
--
accidentally
.
Tom
had
no
handkerchief
,
and
he
looked
upon
boys
*NL*
who
had
as
snobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
congregation
being
fully
assembled
,
now
,
the
bell
rang
once
more
,
*NL*
to
warn
laggards
and
stragglers
,
and
then
a
solemn
hush
fell
upon
the
*NL*
church
which
was
only
broken
by
the
tittering
and
whispering
of
the
*NL*
choir
in
the
gallery
.
The
choir
always
tittered
and
whispered
all
*NL*
through
service
.
There
was
once
a
church
choir
that
was
not
ill-bred
,
*NL*
but
I
have
forgotten
where
it
was
,
now
.
It
was
a
great
many
years
ago
,
*NL*
and
I
can
scarcely
remember
anything
about
it
,
but
I
think
it
was
in
*NL*
some
foreign
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
gave
out
the
hymn
,
and
read
it
through
with
a
relish
,
in
a
*NL*
peculiar
style
which
was
much
admired
in
that
part
of
the
country
.
His
*NL*
voice
began
on
a
medium
key
and
climbed
steadily
up
till
it
reached
a
*NL*
certain
point
,
where
it
bore
with
strong
emphasis
upon
the
topmost
word
*NL*
and
then
plunged
down
as
if
from
a
spring-board
:
*NL*
*NL*
Shall
I
be
car-ri-ed
toe
the
skies
,
on
flow
`
ry
_
beds
_
of
ease
,
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
others
fight
to
win
the
prize
,
and
sail
thro
'
_
blood
_
-
y
seas
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
regarded
as
a
wonderful
reader
.
At
church
``
sociables
''
he
was
*NL*
always
called
upon
to
read
poetry
;
and
when
he
was
through
,
the
ladies
*NL*
would
lift
up
their
hands
and
let
them
fall
helplessly
in
their
laps
,
*NL*
and
``
wall
''
their
eyes
,
and
shake
their
heads
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
Words
*NL*
can
not
express
it
;
it
is
too
beautiful
,
TOO
beautiful
for
this
mortal
*NL*
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
hymn
had
been
sung
,
the
Rev.
Mr.
Sprague
turned
himself
into
*NL*
a
bulletin-board
,
and
read
off
``
notices
''
of
meetings
and
societies
and
*NL*
things
till
it
seemed
that
the
list
would
stretch
out
to
the
crack
of
*NL*
doom
--
a
queer
custom
which
is
still
kept
up
in
America
,
even
in
cities
,
*NL*
away
here
in
this
age
of
abundant
newspapers
.
Often
,
the
less
there
is
*NL*
to
justify
a
traditional
custom
,
the
harder
it
is
to
get
rid
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
minister
prayed
.
A
good
,
generous
prayer
it
was
,
and
went
*NL*
into
details
:
it
pleaded
for
the
church
,
and
the
little
children
of
the
*NL*
church
;
for
the
other
churches
of
the
village
;
for
the
village
itself
;
*NL*
for
the
county
;
for
the
State
;
for
the
State
officers
;
for
the
United
*NL*
States
;
for
the
churches
of
the
United
States
;
for
Congress
;
for
the
*NL*
President
;
for
the
officers
of
the
Government
;
for
poor
sailors
,
tossed
*NL*
by
stormy
seas
;
for
the
oppressed
millions
groaning
under
the
heel
of
*NL*
European
monarchies
and
Oriental
despotisms
;
for
such
as
have
the
light
*NL*
and
the
good
tidings
,
and
yet
have
not
eyes
to
see
nor
ears
to
hear
*NL*
withal
;
for
the
heathen
in
the
far
islands
of
the
sea
;
and
closed
with
*NL*
a
supplication
that
the
words
he
was
about
to
speak
might
find
grace
*NL*
and
favor
,
and
be
as
seed
sown
in
fertile
ground
,
yielding
in
time
a
*NL*
grateful
harvest
of
good
.
Amen
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rustling
of
dresses
,
and
the
standing
congregation
sat
down
.
*NL*
The
boy
whose
history
this
book
relates
did
not
enjoy
the
prayer
,
he
*NL*
only
endured
it
--
if
he
even
did
that
much
.
He
was
restive
all
through
it
;
*NL*
he
kept
tally
of
the
details
of
the
prayer
,
unconsciously
--
for
he
was
not
*NL*
listening
,
but
he
knew
the
ground
of
old
,
and
the
clergyman
's
regular
*NL*
route
over
it
--
and
when
a
little
trifle
of
new
matter
was
interlarded
,
*NL*
his
ear
detected
it
and
his
whole
nature
resented
it
;
he
considered
*NL*
additions
unfair
,
and
scoundrelly
.
In
the
midst
of
the
prayer
a
fly
had
*NL*
lit
on
the
back
of
the
pew
in
front
of
him
and
tortured
his
spirit
by
*NL*
calmly
rubbing
its
hands
together
,
embracing
its
head
with
its
arms
,
and
*NL*
polishing
it
so
vigorously
that
it
seemed
to
almost
part
company
with
*NL*
the
body
,
and
the
slender
thread
of
a
neck
was
exposed
to
view
;
scraping
*NL*
its
wings
with
its
hind
legs
and
smoothing
them
to
its
body
as
if
they
*NL*
had
been
coat-tails
;
going
through
its
whole
toilet
as
tranquilly
as
if
*NL*
it
knew
it
was
perfectly
safe
.
As
indeed
it
was
;
for
as
sorely
as
Tom
's
*NL*
hands
itched
to
grab
for
it
they
did
not
dare
--
he
believed
his
soul
would
*NL*
be
instantly
destroyed
if
he
did
such
a
thing
while
the
prayer
was
going
*NL*
on
.
But
with
the
closing
sentence
his
hand
began
to
curve
and
steal
*NL*
forward
;
and
the
instant
the
``
Amen
''
was
out
the
fly
was
a
prisoner
of
*NL*
war
.
His
aunt
detected
the
act
and
made
him
let
it
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minister
gave
out
his
text
and
droned
along
monotonously
through
an
*NL*
argument
that
was
so
prosy
that
many
a
head
by
and
by
began
to
nod
--
and
*NL*
yet
it
was
an
argument
that
dealt
in
limitless
fire
and
brimstone
and
*NL*
thinned
the
predestined
elect
down
to
a
company
so
small
as
to
be
hardly
*NL*
worth
the
saving
.
Tom
counted
the
pages
of
the
sermon
;
after
church
he
*NL*
always
knew
how
many
pages
there
had
been
,
but
he
seldom
knew
anything
*NL*
else
about
the
discourse
.
However
,
this
time
he
was
really
interested
*NL*
for
a
little
while
.
The
minister
made
a
grand
and
moving
picture
of
the
*NL*
assembling
together
of
the
world
's
hosts
at
the
millennium
when
the
lion
*NL*
and
the
lamb
should
lie
down
together
and
a
little
child
should
lead
*NL*
them
.
But
the
pathos
,
the
lesson
,
the
moral
of
the
great
spectacle
*NL*
were
lost
upon
the
boy
;
he
only
thought
of
the
conspicuousness
of
the
*NL*
principal
character
before
the
on-looking
nations
;
his
face
lit
with
the
*NL*
thought
,
and
he
said
to
himself
that
he
wished
he
could
be
that
child
,
*NL*
if
it
was
a
tame
lion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
he
lapsed
into
suffering
again
,
as
the
dry
argument
was
resumed
.
*NL*
Presently
he
bethought
him
of
a
treasure
he
had
and
got
it
out
.
It
was
*NL*
a
large
black
beetle
with
formidable
jaws
--
a
``
pinchbug
,
''
he
called
it
.
It
*NL*
was
in
a
percussion-cap
box
.
The
first
thing
the
beetle
did
was
to
*NL*
take
him
by
the
finger
.
A
natural
fillip
followed
,
the
beetle
went
*NL*
floundering
into
the
aisle
and
lit
on
its
back
,
and
the
hurt
finger
went
*NL*
into
the
boy
's
mouth
.
The
beetle
lay
there
working
its
helpless
legs
,
*NL*
unable
to
turn
over
.
Tom
eyed
it
,
and
longed
for
it
;
but
it
was
safe
out
*NL*
of
his
reach
.
Other
people
uninterested
in
the
sermon
found
relief
in
*NL*
the
beetle
,
and
they
eyed
it
too
.
Presently
a
vagrant
poodle
dog
came
*NL*
idling
along
,
sad
at
heart
,
lazy
with
the
summer
softness
and
the
*NL*
quiet
,
weary
of
captivity
,
sighing
for
change
.
He
spied
the
beetle
;
the
*NL*
drooping
tail
lifted
and
wagged
.
He
surveyed
the
prize
;
walked
around
*NL*
it
;
smelt
at
it
from
a
safe
distance
;
walked
around
it
again
;
grew
*NL*
bolder
,
and
took
a
closer
smell
;
then
lifted
his
lip
and
made
a
gingerly
*NL*
snatch
at
it
,
just
missing
it
;
made
another
,
and
another
;
began
to
enjoy
*NL*
the
diversion
;
subsided
to
his
stomach
with
the
beetle
between
his
paws
,
*NL*
and
continued
his
experiments
;
grew
weary
at
last
,
and
then
indifferent
*NL*
and
absent-minded
.
His
head
nodded
,
and
little
by
little
his
chin
*NL*
descended
and
touched
the
enemy
,
who
seized
it
.
There
was
a
sharp
yelp
,
*NL*
a
flirt
of
the
poodle
's
head
,
and
the
beetle
fell
a
couple
of
yards
*NL*
away
,
and
lit
on
its
back
once
more
.
The
neighboring
spectators
*NL*
shook
with
a
gentle
inward
joy
,
several
faces
went
behind
fans
and
*NL*
hand-kerchiefs
,
and
Tom
was
entirely
happy
.
The
dog
looked
foolish
,
*NL*
and
probably
felt
so
;
but
there
was
resentment
in
his
heart
,
too
,
and
a
*NL*
craving
for
revenge
.
So
he
went
to
the
beetle
and
began
a
wary
attack
on
*NL*
it
again
;
jumping
at
it
from
every
point
of
a
circle
,
lighting
with
his
*NL*
fore-paws
within
an
inch
of
the
creature
,
making
even
closer
snatches
at
*NL*
it
with
his
teeth
,
and
jerking
his
head
till
his
ears
flapped
again
.
But
*NL*
he
grew
tired
once
more
,
after
a
while
;
tried
to
amuse
himself
with
a
*NL*
fly
but
found
no
relief
;
followed
an
ant
around
,
with
his
nose
close
*NL*
to
the
floor
,
and
quickly
wearied
of
that
;
yawned
,
sighed
,
forgot
the
*NL*
beetle
entirely
,
and
sat
down
on
it
.
Then
there
was
a
wild
yelp
of
agony
*NL*
and
the
poodle
went
sailing
up
the
aisle
;
the
yelps
continued
,
and
so
*NL*
did
the
dog
;
he
crossed
the
house
in
front
of
the
altar
;
he
flew
*NL*
down
the
other
aisle
;
he
crossed
before
the
doors
;
he
clamored
up
the
*NL*
home-stretch
;
his
anguish
grew
with
his
progress
,
till
presently
he
was
*NL*
but
a
woolly
comet
moving
in
its
orbit
with
the
gleam
and
the
speed
of
*NL*
light
.
At
last
the
frantic
sufferer
sheered
from
its
course
,
and
sprang
*NL*
into
its
master
's
lap
;
he
flung
it
out
of
the
window
,
and
the
voice
of
*NL*
distress
quickly
thinned
away
and
died
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
whole
church
was
red-faced
and
suffocating
with
*NL*
suppressed
laughter
,
and
the
sermon
had
come
to
a
dead
standstill
.
*NL*
The
discourse
was
resumed
presently
,
but
it
went
lame
and
halting
,
all
*NL*
possibility
of
impressiveness
being
at
an
end
;
for
even
the
gravest
*NL*
sentiments
were
constantly
being
received
with
a
smothered
burst
of
*NL*
unholy
mirth
,
under
cover
of
some
remote
pew-back
,
as
if
the
poor
parson
*NL*
had
said
a
rarely
facetious
thing
.
It
was
a
genuine
relief
to
the
whole
*NL*
congregation
when
the
ordeal
was
over
and
the
benediction
pronounced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Sawyer
went
home
quite
cheerful
,
thinking
to
himself
that
there
was
*NL*
some
satisfaction
about
divine
service
when
there
was
a
bit
of
variety
*NL*
in
it
.
He
had
but
one
marring
thought
;
he
was
willing
that
the
dog
*NL*
should
play
with
his
pinchbug
,
but
he
did
not
think
it
was
upright
in
*NL*
him
to
carry
it
off
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
MONDAY
morning
found
Tom
Sawyer
miserable
.
Monday
morning
always
found
*NL*
him
so
--
because
it
began
another
week
's
slow
suffering
in
school
.
He
*NL*
generally
began
that
day
with
wishing
he
had
had
no
intervening
holiday
,
*NL*
it
made
the
going
into
captivity
and
fetters
again
so
much
more
odious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
lay
thinking
.
Presently
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
wished
he
was
*NL*
sick
;
then
he
could
stay
home
from
school
.
Here
was
a
vague
possibility
.
*NL*
He
canvassed
his
system
.
No
ailment
was
found
,
and
he
investigated
*NL*
again
.
This
time
he
thought
he
could
detect
colicky
symptoms
,
and
he
*NL*
began
to
encourage
them
with
considerable
hope
.
But
they
soon
grew
*NL*
feeble
,
and
presently
died
wholly
away
.
He
reflected
further
.
Suddenly
*NL*
he
discovered
something
.
One
of
his
upper
front
teeth
was
loose
.
This
*NL*
was
lucky
;
he
was
about
to
begin
to
groan
,
as
a
``
starter
,
''
as
he
*NL*
called
it
,
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
if
he
came
into
court
with
that
*NL*
argument
,
his
aunt
would
pull
it
out
,
and
that
would
hurt
.
So
he
thought
*NL*
he
would
hold
the
tooth
in
reserve
for
the
present
,
and
seek
further
.
*NL*
Nothing
offered
for
some
little
time
,
and
then
he
remembered
hearing
*NL*
the
doctor
tell
about
a
certain
thing
that
laid
up
a
patient
for
two
or
*NL*
three
weeks
and
threatened
to
make
him
lose
a
finger
.
So
the
boy
eagerly
*NL*
drew
his
sore
toe
from
under
the
sheet
and
held
it
up
for
inspection
.
*NL*
But
now
he
did
not
know
the
necessary
symptoms
.
However
,
it
seemed
*NL*
well
worth
while
to
chance
it
,
so
he
fell
to
groaning
with
considerable
*NL*
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Sid
slept
on
unconscious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
groaned
louder
,
and
fancied
that
he
began
to
feel
pain
in
the
toe
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
result
from
Sid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
panting
with
his
exertions
by
this
time
.
He
took
a
rest
and
then
*NL*
swelled
himself
up
and
fetched
a
succession
of
admirable
groans
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sid
snored
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
aggravated
.
He
said
,
``
Sid
,
Sid
!
''
and
shook
him
.
This
course
*NL*
worked
well
,
and
Tom
began
to
groan
again
.
Sid
yawned
,
stretched
,
then
*NL*
brought
himself
up
on
his
elbow
with
a
snort
,
and
began
to
stare
at
Tom
.
*NL*
Tom
went
on
groaning
.
Sid
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
!
Say
,
Tom
!
''
-LSB-
No
response
.
-RSB-
``
Here
,
Tom
!
TOM
!
What
is
the
matter
,
*NL*
Tom
?
''
And
he
shook
him
and
looked
in
his
face
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
moaned
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
,
Sid
.
Do
n't
joggle
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
,
Tom
?
I
must
call
auntie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
never
mind
.
It
'll
be
over
by
and
by
,
maybe
.
Do
n't
call
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
!
_
Do
n't
_
groan
so
,
Tom
,
it
's
awful
.
How
long
you
been
this
*NL*
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hours
.
Ouch
!
Oh
,
do
n't
stir
so
,
Sid
,
you
'll
kill
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
why
did
n't
you
wake
me
sooner
?
Oh
,
Tom
,
_
do
n't
!
_
It
makes
my
flesh
*NL*
crawl
to
hear
you
.
Tom
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgive
you
everything
,
Sid
.
-LSB-
Groan
.
-RSB-
Everything
you
've
ever
done
to
*NL*
me
.
When
I
'm
gone
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
you
ai
n't
dying
,
are
you
?
Do
n't
,
Tom
--
oh
,
do
n't
.
Maybe

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgive
everybody
,
Sid
.
-LSB-
Groan
.
-RSB-
Tell
'em
so
,
Sid
.
And
Sid
,
you
give
*NL*
my
window-sash
and
my
cat
with
one
eye
to
that
new
girl
that
's
come
to
*NL*
town
,
and
tell
her
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Sid
had
snatched
his
clothes
and
gone
.
Tom
was
suffering
in
reality
,
*NL*
now
,
so
handsomely
was
his
imagination
working
,
and
so
his
groans
had
*NL*
gathered
quite
a
genuine
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sid
flew
downstairs
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Aunt
Polly
,
come
!
Tom
's
dying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
'm
.
Do
n't
wait
--
come
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rubbage
!
I
do
n't
believe
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
fled
upstairs
,
nevertheless
,
with
Sid
and
Mary
at
her
heels
.
*NL*
And
her
face
grew
white
,
too
,
and
her
lip
trembled
.
When
she
reached
the
*NL*
bedside
she
gasped
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
Tom
!
Tom
,
what
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
auntie
,
I
'm
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
--
what
is
the
matter
with
you
,
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
auntie
,
my
sore
toe
's
mortified
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
sank
down
into
a
chair
and
laughed
a
little
,
then
cried
a
*NL*
little
,
then
did
both
together
.
This
restored
her
and
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
what
a
turn
you
did
give
me
.
Now
you
shut
up
that
nonsense
and
*NL*
climb
out
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
groans
ceased
and
the
pain
vanished
from
the
toe
.
The
boy
felt
a
*NL*
little
foolish
,
and
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
Polly
,
it
_
seemed
_
mortified
,
and
it
hurt
so
I
never
minded
my
*NL*
tooth
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
tooth
,
indeed
!
What
's
the
matter
with
your
tooth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
of
them
's
loose
,
and
it
aches
perfectly
awful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
there
,
now
,
do
n't
begin
that
groaning
again
.
Open
your
mouth
.
*NL*
Well
--
your
tooth
_
is
_
loose
,
but
you
're
not
going
to
die
about
that
.
*NL*
Mary
,
get
me
a
silk
thread
,
and
a
chunk
of
fire
out
of
the
kitchen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
,
auntie
,
do
n't
pull
it
out
.
It
do
n't
hurt
any
more
.
I
wish
*NL*
I
may
never
stir
if
it
does
.
Please
do
n't
,
auntie
.
I
do
n't
want
to
stay
*NL*
home
from
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
do
n't
,
do
n't
you
?
So
all
this
row
was
because
you
thought
you
'd
*NL*
get
to
stay
home
from
school
and
go
a-fishing
?
Tom
,
Tom
,
I
love
you
so
,
*NL*
and
you
seem
to
try
every
way
you
can
to
break
my
old
heart
with
your
*NL*
outrageousness
.
''
By
this
time
the
dental
instruments
were
ready
.
The
old
*NL*
lady
made
one
end
of
the
silk
thread
fast
to
Tom
's
tooth
with
a
loop
*NL*
and
tied
the
other
to
the
bedpost
.
Then
she
seized
the
chunk
of
fire
and
*NL*
suddenly
thrust
it
almost
into
the
boy
's
face
.
The
tooth
hung
dangling
*NL*
by
the
bedpost
,
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
trials
bring
their
compensations
.
As
Tom
wended
to
school
after
*NL*
breakfast
,
he
was
the
envy
of
every
boy
he
met
because
the
gap
in
his
*NL*
upper
row
of
teeth
enabled
him
to
expectorate
in
a
new
and
admirable
*NL*
way
.
He
gathered
quite
a
following
of
lads
interested
in
the
exhibition
;
*NL*
and
one
that
had
cut
his
finger
and
had
been
a
centre
of
fascination
and
*NL*
homage
up
to
this
time
,
now
found
himself
suddenly
without
an
adherent
,
*NL*
and
shorn
of
his
glory
.
His
heart
was
heavy
,
and
he
said
with
a
disdain
*NL*
which
he
did
not
feel
that
it
was
n't
anything
to
spit
like
Tom
Sawyer
;
*NL*
but
another
boy
said
,
``
Sour
grapes
!
''
and
he
wandered
away
a
dismantled
*NL*
hero
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
Tom
came
upon
the
juvenile
pariah
of
the
village
,
Huckleberry
*NL*
Finn
,
son
of
the
town
drunkard
.
Huckleberry
was
cordially
hated
and
*NL*
dreaded
by
all
the
mothers
of
the
town
,
because
he
was
idle
and
lawless
*NL*
and
vulgar
and
bad
--
and
because
all
their
children
admired
him
so
,
and
*NL*
delighted
in
his
forbidden
society
,
and
wished
they
dared
to
be
like
*NL*
him
.
Tom
was
like
the
rest
of
the
respectable
boys
,
in
that
he
envied
*NL*
Huckleberry
his
gaudy
outcast
condition
,
and
was
under
strict
orders
*NL*
not
to
play
with
him
.
So
he
played
with
him
every
time
he
got
a
chance
.
*NL*
Huckleberry
was
always
dressed
in
the
cast-off
clothes
of
full-grown
*NL*
men
,
and
they
were
in
perennial
bloom
and
fluttering
with
rags
.
His
hat
*NL*
was
a
vast
ruin
with
a
wide
crescent
lopped
out
of
its
brim
;
his
coat
,
*NL*
when
he
wore
one
,
hung
nearly
to
his
heels
and
had
the
rearward
buttons
*NL*
far
down
the
back
;
but
one
suspender
supported
his
trousers
;
the
seat
of
*NL*
the
trousers
bagged
low
and
contained
nothing
,
the
fringed
legs
dragged
*NL*
in
the
dirt
when
not
rolled
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Huckleberry
came
and
went
,
at
his
own
free
will
.
He
slept
on
doorsteps
*NL*
in
fine
weather
and
in
empty
hogsheads
in
wet
;
he
did
not
have
to
go
to
*NL*
school
or
to
church
,
or
call
any
being
master
or
obey
anybody
;
he
could
*NL*
go
fishing
or
swimming
when
and
where
he
chose
,
and
stay
as
long
as
it
*NL*
suited
him
;
nobody
forbade
him
to
fight
;
he
could
sit
up
as
late
as
he
*NL*
pleased
;
he
was
always
the
first
boy
that
went
barefoot
in
the
spring
*NL*
and
the
last
to
resume
leather
in
the
fall
;
he
never
had
to
wash
,
nor
*NL*
put
on
clean
clothes
;
he
could
swear
wonderfully
.
In
a
word
,
everything
*NL*
that
goes
to
make
life
precious
that
boy
had
.
So
thought
every
harassed
,
*NL*
hampered
,
respectable
boy
in
St.
Petersburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
hailed
the
romantic
outcast
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello

Huckleberry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

you

keep

*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
got
out
a
bit
of
paper
and
carefully
unrolled
it
.
Huckleberry
viewed
*NL*
it
wistfully
.
The
temptation
was
very
strong
.
At
last
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
genuwyne
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
lifted
his
lip
and
showed
the
vacancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
all
right
,
''
said
Huckleberry
,
``
it
's
a
trade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
enclosed
the
tick
in
the
percussion-cap
box
that
had
lately
been
the
*NL*
pinchbug
's
prison
,
and
the
boys
separated
,
each
feeling
wealthier
than
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Tom
reached
the
little
isolated
frame
school-house
,
he
strode
in
*NL*
briskly
,
with
the
manner
of
one
who
had
come
with
all
honest
speed
.
He
*NL*
hung
his
hat
on
a
peg
and
flung
himself
into
his
seat
with
business-like
*NL*
alacrity
.
The
master
,
throned
on
high
in
his
great
splint-bottom
*NL*
arm-chair
,
was
dozing
,
lulled
by
the
drowsy
hum
of
study
.
The
*NL*
interruption
roused
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomas
Sawyer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
knew
that
when
his
name
was
pronounced
in
full
,
it
meant
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
up
here
.
Now
,
sir
,
why
are
you
late
again
,
as
usual
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
about
to
take
refuge
in
a
lie
,
when
he
saw
two
long
tails
of
*NL*
yellow
hair
hanging
down
a
back
that
he
recognized
by
the
electric
*NL*
sympathy
of
love
;
and
by
that
form
was
_
the
only
vacant
place
_
on
the
*NL*
girls
'
side
of
the
school-house
.
He
instantly
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
stopped
to
talk
with
Huckleberry
Finn
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
's
pulse
stood
still
,
and
he
stared
helplessly
.
The
buzz
of
*NL*
study
ceased
.
The
pupils
wondered
if
this
foolhardy
boy
had
lost
his
*NL*
mind
.
The
master
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
--
you
did
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stopped
to
talk
with
Huckleberry
Finn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
mistaking
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomas
Sawyer
,
this
is
the
most
astounding
confession
I
have
ever
*NL*
listened
to
.
No
mere
ferule
will
answer
for
this
offence
.
Take
off
your
*NL*
jacket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
's
arm
performed
until
it
was
tired
and
the
stock
of
switches
*NL*
notably
diminished
.
Then
the
order
followed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
sir
,
go
and
sit
with
the
girls
!
And
let
this
be
a
warning
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
titter
that
rippled
around
the
room
appeared
to
abash
the
boy
,
but
*NL*
in
reality
that
result
was
caused
rather
more
by
his
worshipful
awe
*NL*
of
his
unknown
idol
and
the
dread
pleasure
that
lay
in
his
high
good
*NL*
fortune
.
He
sat
down
upon
the
end
of
the
pine
bench
and
the
girl
hitched
*NL*
herself
away
from
him
with
a
toss
of
her
head
.
Nudges
and
winks
and
*NL*
whispers
traversed
the
room
,
but
Tom
sat
still
,
with
his
arms
upon
the
*NL*
long
,
low
desk
before
him
,
and
seemed
to
study
his
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
attention
ceased
from
him
,
and
the
accustomed
school
murmur
*NL*
rose
upon
the
dull
air
once
more
.
Presently
the
boy
began
to
steal
*NL*
furtive
glances
at
the
girl
.
She
observed
it
,
``
made
a
mouth
''
at
him
*NL*
and
gave
him
the
back
of
her
head
for
the
space
of
a
minute
.
When
she
*NL*
cautiously
faced
around
again
,
a
peach
lay
before
her
.
She
thrust
it
*NL*
away
.
Tom
gently
put
it
back
.
She
thrust
it
away
again
,
but
with
less
*NL*
animosity
.
Tom
patiently
returned
it
to
its
place
.
Then
she
let
it
*NL*
remain
.
Tom
scrawled
on
his
slate
,
``
Please
take
it
--
I
got
more
.
''
The
*NL*
girl
glanced
at
the
words
,
but
made
no
sign
.
Now
the
boy
began
to
draw
*NL*
something
on
the
slate
,
hiding
his
work
with
his
left
hand
.
For
a
time
*NL*
the
girl
refused
to
notice
;
but
her
human
curiosity
presently
began
*NL*
to
manifest
itself
by
hardly
perceptible
signs
.
The
boy
worked
on
,
*NL*
apparently
unconscious
.
The
girl
made
a
sort
of
non-committal
attempt
*NL*
to
see
,
but
the
boy
did
not
betray
that
he
was
aware
of
it
.
At
last
she
*NL*
gave
in
and
hesitatingly
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
partly
uncovered
a
dismal
caricature
of
a
house
with
two
gable
ends
*NL*
to
it
and
a
corkscrew
of
smoke
issuing
from
the
chimney
.
Then
the
girl
's
*NL*
interest
began
to
fasten
itself
upon
the
work
and
she
forgot
everything
*NL*
else
.
When
it
was
finished
,
she
gazed
a
moment
,
then
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nice
--
make
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
erected
a
man
in
the
front
yard
,
that
resembled
a
derrick
.
He
*NL*
could
have
stepped
over
the
house
;
but
the
girl
was
not
hypercritical
;
*NL*
she
was
satisfied
with
the
monster
,
and
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
beautiful
man
--
now
make
me
coming
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
drew
an
hour-glass
with
a
full
moon
and
straw
limbs
to
it
and
armed
*NL*
the
spreading
fingers
with
a
portentous
fan
.
The
girl
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
ever
so
nice
--
I
wish
I
could
draw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
easy
,
''
whispered
Tom
,
``
I
'll
learn
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
will
you
?
When
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
noon
.
Do
you
go
home
to
dinner
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
stay
if
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
--
that
's
a
whack
.
What
's
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Becky
Thatcher

What
's
yours

Oh

It

Sawyer

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

me
by

*NL*
Tom
,
will
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Tom
began
to
scrawl
something
on
the
slate
,
hiding
the
words
from
*NL*
the
girl
.
But
she
was
not
backward
this
time
.
She
begged
to
see
.
Tom
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

all
?
Ever
,
as
long
as
you
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
ever
tell
_
any_body
.
Now
let
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
_
you
_
do
n't
want
to
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
you
treat
me
so
,
I
_
will
_
see
.
''
And
she
put
her
small
hand
*NL*
upon
his
and
a
little
scuffle
ensued
,
Tom
pretending
to
resist
in
*NL*
earnest
but
letting
his
hand
slip
by
degrees
till
these
words
were
*NL*
revealed
:
''
_
I
love
you
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
bad
thing
!
''
And
she
hit
his
hand
a
smart
rap
,
but
reddened
and
*NL*
looked
pleased
,
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
at
this
juncture
the
boy
felt
a
slow
,
fateful
grip
closing
on
his
*NL*
ear
,
and
a
steady
lifting
impulse
.
In
that
wise
he
was
borne
across
the
*NL*
house
and
deposited
in
his
own
seat
,
under
a
peppering
fire
of
giggles
*NL*
from
the
whole
school
.
Then
the
master
stood
over
him
during
a
few
awful
*NL*
moments
,
and
finally
moved
away
to
his
throne
without
saying
a
word
.
But
*NL*
although
Tom
's
ear
tingled
,
his
heart
was
jubilant
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
school
quieted
down
Tom
made
an
honest
effort
to
study
,
but
*NL*
the
turmoil
within
him
was
too
great
.
In
turn
he
took
his
place
in
the
*NL*
reading
class
and
made
a
botch
of
it
;
then
in
the
geography
class
and
*NL*
turned
lakes
into
mountains
,
mountains
into
rivers
,
and
rivers
into
*NL*
continents
,
till
chaos
was
come
again
;
then
in
the
spelling
class
,
and
*NL*
got
``
turned
down
,
''
by
a
succession
of
mere
baby
words
,
till
he
brought
*NL*
up
at
the
foot
and
yielded
up
the
pewter
medal
which
he
had
worn
with
*NL*
ostentation
for
months
.

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
harder
Tom
tried
to
fasten
his
mind
on
his
book
,
the
more
his
ideas
*NL*
wandered
.
So
at
last
,
with
a
sigh
and
a
yawn
,
he
gave
it
up
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
him
that
the
noon
recess
would
never
come
.
The
air
was
utterly
dead
.
*NL*
There
was
not
a
breath
stirring
.
It
was
the
sleepiest
of
sleepy
days
.
*NL*
The
drowsing
murmur
of
the
five
and
twenty
studying
scholars
soothed
*NL*
the
soul
like
the
spell
that
is
in
the
murmur
of
bees
.
Away
off
in
the
*NL*
flaming
sunshine
,
Cardiff
Hill
lifted
its
soft
green
sides
through
a
*NL*
shimmering
veil
of
heat
,
tinted
with
the
purple
of
distance
;
a
few
birds
*NL*
floated
on
lazy
wing
high
in
the
air
;
no
other
living
thing
was
visible
*NL*
but
some
cows
,
and
they
were
asleep
.
Tom
's
heart
ached
to
be
free
,
or
*NL*
else
to
have
something
of
interest
to
do
to
pass
the
dreary
time
.
*NL*
His
hand
wandered
into
his
pocket
and
his
face
lit
up
with
a
glow
of
*NL*
gratitude
that
was
prayer
,
though
he
did
not
know
it
.
Then
furtively
*NL*
the
percussion-cap
box
came
out
.
He
released
the
tick
and
put
him
on
*NL*
the
long
flat
desk
.
The
creature
probably
glowed
with
a
gratitude
that
*NL*
amounted
to
prayer
,
too
,
at
this
moment
,
but
it
was
premature
:
for
when
*NL*
he
started
thankfully
to
travel
off
,
Tom
turned
him
aside
with
a
pin
and
*NL*
made
him
take
a
new
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
bosom
friend
sat
next
him
,
suffering
just
as
Tom
had
been
,
and
*NL*
now
he
was
deeply
and
gratefully
interested
in
this
entertainment
in
*NL*
an
instant
.
This
bosom
friend
was
Joe
Harper
.
The
two
boys
were
sworn
*NL*
friends
all
the
week
,
and
embattled
enemies
on
Saturdays
.
Joe
took
a
*NL*
pin
out
of
his
lapel
and
began
to
assist
in
exercising
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
The
sport
grew
in
interest
momently
.
Soon
Tom
said
that
they
were
*NL*
interfering
with
each
other
,
and
neither
getting
the
fullest
benefit
*NL*
of
the
tick
.
So
he
put
Joe
's
slate
on
the
desk
and
drew
a
line
down
the
*NL*
middle
of
it
from
top
to
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
as
long
as
he
is
on
your
side
you
can
stir
him
up
and
*NL*
I
'll
let
him
alone
;
but
if
you
let
him
get
away
and
get
on
my
side
,
*NL*
you
're
to
leave
him
alone
as
long
as
I
can
keep
him
from
crossing
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
go
ahead
;
start
him
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tick
escaped
from
Tom
,
presently
,
and
crossed
the
equator
.
Joe
*NL*
harassed
him
awhile
,
and
then
he
got
away
and
crossed
back
again
.
This
*NL*
change
of
base
occurred
often
.
While
one
boy
was
worrying
the
tick
with
*NL*
absorbing
interest
,
the
other
would
look
on
with
interest
as
strong
,
the
*NL*
two
heads
bowed
together
over
the
slate
,
and
the
two
souls
dead
to
all
*NL*
things
else
.
At
last
luck
seemed
to
settle
and
abide
with
Joe
.
The
*NL*
tick
tried
this
,
that
,
and
the
other
course
,
and
got
as
excited
and
as
*NL*
anxious
as
the
boys
themselves
,
but
time
and
again
just
as
he
would
*NL*
have
victory
in
his
very
grasp
,
so
to
speak
,
and
Tom
's
fingers
would
*NL*
be
twitching
to
begin
,
Joe
's
pin
would
deftly
head
him
off
,
and
keep
*NL*
possession
.
At
last
Tom
could
stand
it
no
longer
.
The
temptation
was
too
*NL*
strong
.
So
he
reached
out
and
lent
a
hand
with
his
pin
.
Joe
was
angry
in
*NL*
a
moment
.
Said
he
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
you
let
him
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
just
want
to
stir
him
up
a
little
,
Joe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
it
ai
n't
fair
;
you
just
let
him
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blame
it
,
I
ai
n't
going
to
stir
him
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
him
alone
,
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
--
he
's
on
my
side
of
the
line
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Joe
Harper
,
whose
is
that
tick
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
whose
tick
he
is
--
he
's
on
my
side
of
the
line
,
and
you
*NL*
sha
'n'
t
touch
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
just
bet
I
will
,
though
.
He
's
my
tick
and
I
'll
do
what
I
*NL*
blame
please
with
him
,
or
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
tremendous
whack
came
down
on
Tom
's
shoulders
,
and
its
duplicate
on
*NL*
Joe
's
;
and
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
the
dust
continued
to
fly
from
*NL*
the
two
jackets
and
the
whole
school
to
enjoy
it
.
The
boys
had
been
*NL*
too
absorbed
to
notice
the
hush
that
had
stolen
upon
the
school
awhile
*NL*
before
when
the
master
came
tiptoeing
down
the
room
and
stood
over
them
.
*NL*
He
had
contemplated
a
good
part
of
the
performance
before
he
contributed
*NL*
his
bit
of
variety
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
school
broke
up
at
noon
,
Tom
flew
to
Becky
Thatcher
,
and
whispered
*NL*
in
her
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
on
your
bonnet
and
let
on
you
're
going
home
;
and
when
you
get
to
*NL*
the
corner
,
give
the
rest
of
'em
the
slip
,
and
turn
down
through
the
*NL*
lane
and
come
back
.
I
'll
go
the
other
way
and
come
it
over
'em
the
same
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
one
went
off
with
one
group
of
scholars
,
and
the
other
with
*NL*
another
.
In
a
little
while
the
two
met
at
the
bottom
of
the
lane
,
and
*NL*
when
they
reached
the
school
they
had
it
all
to
themselves
.
Then
they
*NL*
sat
together
,
with
a
slate
before
them
,
and
Tom
gave
Becky
the
pencil
*NL*
and
held
her
hand
in
his
,
guiding
it
,
and
so
created
another
surprising
*NL*
house
.
When
the
interest
in
art
began
to
wane
,
the
two
fell
to
talking
.
*NL*
Tom
was
swimming
in
bliss
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
love
rats
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
I
hate
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
,
too
--
_
live
_
ones
.
But
I
mean
dead
ones
,
to
swing
round
your
*NL*
head
with
a
string
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
care
for
rats
much
,
anyway
.
What
I
like
is
chewing-gum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
should
say
so
!
I
wish
I
had
some
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
I
've
got
some
.
I
'll
let
you
chew
it
awhile
,
but
you
must
give
*NL*
it
back
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
agreeable
,
so
they
chewed
it
turn
about
,
and
dangled
their
legs
*NL*
against
the
bench
in
excess
of
contentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
you
ever
at
a
circus
?
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
my
pa
's
going
to
take
me
again
some
time
,
if
I
'm
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

to

circus

or
four
times

*NL*
``

will

*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
Becky
hesitating
,
Tom
took
silence
for
consent
,
and
passed
his
arm
about
*NL*
her
waist
and
whispered
the
tale
ever
so
softly
,
with
his
mouth
close
to
*NL*
her
ear
.
And
then
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

whisper
it
to
me

just
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
resisted
,
for
a
while
,
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
turn
your
face
away
so
you
ca
n't

then
I
will

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

indeed

indeed
I
wo

Now

Becky

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
face
away
.
She
bent
timidly
around
till
her
breath
stirred
*NL*
his
curls
and
whispered
,
``
I
--
love
--
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
sprang
away
and
ran
around
and
around
the
desks
and
benches
,
*NL*
with
Tom
after
her
,
and
took
refuge
in
a
corner
at
last
,
with
her
little
*NL*
white
apron
to
her
face
.
Tom
clasped
her
about
her
neck
and
pleaded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Becky
,
it
's
all
done
--
all
over
but
the
kiss
.
Do
n't
you
be
afraid
*NL*
of
that
--
it
ai
n't
anything
at
all

Please

''
And
he
tugged
at
her
*NL*
apron
and
the
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
she
gave
up
,
and
let
her
hands
drop
;
her
face
,
all
glowing
*NL*
with
the
struggle
,
came
up
and
submitted
.
Tom
kissed
the
red
lips
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
it
's
all
done

's
the
way
you
do
when
you
're
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
nice
.
I
never
heard
of
it
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
ever
so
gay
!
Why
,
me
and
Amy
Lawrence
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
big
eyes
told
Tom
his
blunder
and
he
stopped
,
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
!
Then
I
ai
n't
the
first
you
've
ever
been
engaged
to
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
began
to
cry
.
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
cry
,
Becky
,
I
do
n't
care
for
her
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
do
,
Tom
--
you
know
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
tried
to
put
his
arm
about
her
neck
,
but
she
pushed
him
away
and
*NL*
turned
her
face
to
the
wall
,
and
went
on
crying
.
Tom
tried
again
,
with
*NL*
soothing
words
in
his
mouth
,
and
was
repulsed
again
.
Then
his
pride
was
*NL*
up
,
and
he
strode
away
and
went
outside
.
He
stood
about
,
restless
and
*NL*
uneasy
,
for
a
while
,
glancing
at
the
door
,
every
now
and
then
,
hoping
*NL*
she
would
repent
and
come
to
find
him
.
But
she
did
not
.
Then
he
began
*NL*
to
feel
badly
and
fear
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
.
It
was
a
hard
struggle
*NL*
with
him
to
make
new
advances
,
now
,
but
he
nerved
himself
to
it
and
*NL*
entered
.
She
was
still
standing
back
there
in
the
corner
,
sobbing
,
with
*NL*
her
face
to
the
wall
.
Tom
's
heart
smote
him
.
He
went
to
her
and
stood
a
*NL*
moment
,
not
knowing
exactly
how
to
proceed
.
Then
he
said
hesitatingly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Becky
,
I
--
I
do
n't
care
for
anybody
but
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
reply
--
but
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Becky
''
--
pleadingly
.
``
Becky
,
wo
n't
you
say
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
More
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
got
out
his
chiefest
jewel
,
a
brass
knob
from
the
top
of
an
andiron
,
*NL*
and
passed
it
around
her
so
that
she
could
see
it
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
Becky
,
wo
n't
you
take
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
struck
it
to
the
floor
.
Then
Tom
marched
out
of
the
house
and
over
*NL*
the
hills
and
far
away
,
to
return
to
school
no
more
that
day
.
Presently
*NL*
Becky
began
to
suspect
.
She
ran
to
the
door
;
he
was
not
in
sight
;
she
*NL*
flew
around
to
the
play-yard
;
he
was
not
there
.
Then
she
called
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
!
Come
back
,
Tom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
intently
,
but
there
was
no
answer
.
She
had
no
companions
*NL*
but
silence
and
loneliness
.
So
she
sat
down
to
cry
again
and
upbraid
*NL*
herself
;
and
by
this
time
the
scholars
began
to
gather
again
,
and
she
*NL*
had
to
hide
her
griefs
and
still
her
broken
heart
and
take
up
the
cross
*NL*
of
a
long
,
dreary
,
aching
afternoon
,
with
none
among
the
strangers
about
*NL*
her
to
exchange
sorrows
with
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
TOM
dodged
hither
and
thither
through
lanes
until
he
was
well
out
of
the
*NL*
track
of
returning
scholars
,
and
then
fell
into
a
moody
jog
.
He
crossed
*NL*
a
small
``
branch
''
two
or
three
times
,
because
of
a
prevailing
juvenile
*NL*
superstition
that
to
cross
water
baffled
pursuit
.
Half
an
hour
later
*NL*
he
was
disappearing
behind
the
Douglas
mansion
on
the
summit
of
Cardiff
*NL*
Hill
,
and
the
school-house
was
hardly
distinguishable
away
off
in
the
*NL*
valley
behind
him
.
He
entered
a
dense
wood
,
picked
his
pathless
way
to
*NL*
the
centre
of
it
,
and
sat
down
on
a
mossy
spot
under
a
spreading
oak
.
*NL*
There
was
not
even
a
zephyr
stirring
;
the
dead
noonday
heat
had
even
*NL*
stilled
the
songs
of
the
birds
;
nature
lay
in
a
trance
that
was
broken
*NL*
by
no
sound
but
the
occasional
far-off
hammering
of
a
wood-pecker
,
and
*NL*
this
seemed
to
render
the
pervading
silence
and
sense
of
loneliness
the
*NL*
more
profound
.
The
boy
's
soul
was
steeped
in
melancholy
;
his
feelings
*NL*
were
in
happy
accord
with
his
surroundings
.
He
sat
long
with
his
elbows
*NL*
on
his
knees
and
his
chin
in
his
hands
,
meditating
.
It
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
life
was
but
a
trouble
,
at
best
,
and
he
more
than
half
envied
Jimmy
*NL*
Hodges
,
so
lately
released
;
it
must
be
very
peaceful
,
he
thought
,
to
lie
*NL*
and
slumber
and
dream
forever
and
ever
,
with
the
wind
whispering
through
*NL*
the
trees
and
caressing
the
grass
and
the
flowers
over
the
grave
,
and
*NL*
nothing
to
bother
and
grieve
about
,
ever
any
more
.
If
he
only
had
a
*NL*
clean
Sunday-school
record
he
could
be
willing
to
go
,
and
be
done
with
*NL*
it
all
.
Now
as
to
this
girl
.
What
had
he
done
?
Nothing
.
He
had
meant
*NL*
the
best
in
the
world
,
and
been
treated
like
a
dog
--
like
a
very
dog
.
She
*NL*
would
be
sorry
some
day
--
maybe
when
it
was
too
late
.
Ah
,
if
he
could
only
*NL*
die
_
temporarily
_
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
elastic
heart
of
youth
can
not
be
compressed
into
one
constrained
*NL*
shape
long
at
a
time
.
Tom
presently
began
to
drift
insensibly
back
into
*NL*
the
concerns
of
this
life
again
.
What
if
he
turned
his
back
,
now
,
and
*NL*
disappeared
mysteriously
?
What
if
he
went
away
--
ever
so
far
away
,
into
*NL*
unknown
countries
beyond
the
seas
--
and
never
came
back
any
more
!
How
*NL*
would
she
feel
then
!
The
idea
of
being
a
clown
recurred
to
him
now
,
only
*NL*
to
fill
him
with
disgust
.
For
frivolity
and
jokes
and
spotted
tights
*NL*
were
an
offense
,
when
they
intruded
themselves
upon
a
spirit
that
was
*NL*
exalted
into
the
vague
august
realm
of
the
romantic
.
No
,
he
would
be
*NL*
a
soldier
,
and
return
after
long
years
,
all
war-worn
and
illustrious
.
*NL*
No
--
better
still
,
he
would
join
the
Indians
,
and
hunt
buffaloes
and
go
on
*NL*
the
warpath
in
the
mountain
ranges
and
the
trackless
great
plains
of
the
*NL*
Far
West
,
and
away
in
the
future
come
back
a
great
chief
,
bristling
with
*NL*
feathers
,
hideous
with
paint
,
and
prance
into
Sunday-school
,
some
drowsy
*NL*
summer
morning
,
with
a
blood-curdling
war-whoop
,
and
sear
the
eyeballs
*NL*
of
all
his
companions
with
unappeasable
envy
.
But
no
,
there
was
*NL*
something
gaudier
even
than
this
.
He
would
be
a
pirate
!
That
was
it
!
*NL*
_
now
_
his
future
lay
plain
before
him
,
and
glowing
with
unimaginable
*NL*
splendor
.
How
his
name
would
fill
the
world
,
and
make
people
shudder
!
*NL*
How
gloriously
he
would
go
plowing
the
dancing
seas
,
in
his
long
,
low
,
*NL*
black-hulled
racer
,
the
Spirit
of
the
Storm
,
with
his
grisly
flag
flying
*NL*
at
the
fore
!
And
at
the
zenith
of
his
fame
,
how
he
would
suddenly
appear
*NL*
at
the
old
village
and
stalk
into
church
,
brown
and
weather-beaten
,
in
*NL*
his
black
velvet
doublet
and
trunks
,
his
great
jack-boots
,
his
crimson
*NL*
sash
,
his
belt
bristling
with
horse-pistols
,
his
crime-rusted
cutlass
*NL*
at
his
side
,
his
slouch
hat
with
waving
plumes
,
his
black
flag
unfurled
,
*NL*
with
the
skull
and
crossbones
on
it
,
and
hear
with
swelling
ecstasy
*NL*
the
whisperings
,
``
It
's
Tom
Sawyer
the
Pirate
!
--
the
Black
Avenger
of
the
*NL*
Spanish
Main
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
it
was
settled
;
his
career
was
determined
.
He
would
run
away
from
*NL*
home
and
enter
upon
it
.
He
would
start
the
very
next
morning
.
Therefore
*NL*
he
must
now
begin
to
get
ready
.
He
would
collect
his
resources
together
.
*NL*
He
went
to
a
rotten
log
near
at
hand
and
began
to
dig
under
one
end
of
*NL*
it
with
his
Barlow
knife
.
He
soon
struck
wood
that
sounded
hollow
.
He
*NL*
put
his
hand
there
and
uttered
this
incantation
impressively
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
n't
come
here
,
come
!
What
's
here
,
stay
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
scraped
away
the
dirt
,
and
exposed
a
pine
shingle
.
He
took
it
*NL*
up
and
disclosed
a
shapely
little
treasure-house
whose
bottom
and
sides
*NL*
were
of
shingles
.
In
it
lay
a
marble
.
Tom
's
astonishment
was
bound-less
!
*NL*
He
scratched
his
head
with
a
perplexed
air
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
beats
anything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
tossed
the
marble
away
pettishly
,
and
stood
cogitating
.
The
*NL*
truth
was
,
that
a
superstition
of
his
had
failed
,
here
,
which
he
and
*NL*
all
his
comrades
had
always
looked
upon
as
infallible
.
If
you
buried
*NL*
a
marble
with
certain
necessary
incantations
,
and
left
it
alone
a
*NL*
fortnight
,
and
then
opened
the
place
with
the
incantation
he
had
just
*NL*
used
,
you
would
find
that
all
the
marbles
you
had
ever
lost
had
gathered
*NL*
themselves
together
there
,
meantime
,
no
matter
how
widely
they
had
been
*NL*
separated
.
But
now
,
this
thing
had
actually
and
unquestionably
failed
.
*NL*
Tom
's
whole
structure
of
faith
was
shaken
to
its
foundations
.
He
had
*NL*
many
a
time
heard
of
this
thing
succeeding
but
never
of
its
failing
*NL*
before
.
It
did
not
occur
to
him
that
he
had
tried
it
several
times
*NL*
before
,
himself
,
but
could
never
find
the
hiding-places
afterward
.
He
*NL*
puzzled
over
the
matter
some
time
,
and
finally
decided
that
some
witch
*NL*
had
interfered
and
broken
the
charm
.
He
thought
he
would
satisfy
himself
*NL*
on
that
point
;
so
he
searched
around
till
he
found
a
small
sandy
spot
*NL*
with
a
little
funnel-shaped
depression
in
it
.
He
laid
himself
down
and
*NL*
put
his
mouth
close
to
this
depression
and
called
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doodle-bug
,
doodle-bug
,
tell
me
what
I
want
to
know
!
Doodle-bug
,
*NL*
doodle-bug
,
tell
me
what
I
want
to
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sand
began
to
work
,
and
presently
a
small
black
bug
appeared
for
a
*NL*
second
and
then
darted
under
again
in
a
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
das
n't
tell
!
So
it
_
was
_
a
witch
that
done
it
.
I
just
knowed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
well
knew
the
futility
of
trying
to
contend
against
witches
,
so
he
*NL*
gave
up
discouraged
.
But
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
might
as
well
have
*NL*
the
marble
he
had
just
thrown
away
,
and
therefore
he
went
and
made
a
*NL*
patient
search
for
it
.
But
he
could
not
find
it
.
Now
he
went
back
to
his
*NL*
treasure-house
and
carefully
placed
himself
just
as
he
had
been
standing
*NL*
when
he
tossed
the
marble
away
;
then
he
took
another
marble
from
his
*NL*
pocket
and
tossed
it
in
the
same
way
,
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brother
,
go
find
your
brother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
where
it
stopped
,
and
went
there
and
looked
.
But
it
must
*NL*
have
fallen
short
or
gone
too
far
;
so
he
tried
twice
more
.
The
last
*NL*
repetition
was
successful
.
The
two
marbles
lay
within
a
foot
of
each
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
here
the
blast
of
a
toy
tin
trumpet
came
faintly
down
the
green
*NL*
aisles
of
the
forest
.
Tom
flung
off
his
jacket
and
trousers
,
turned
*NL*
a
suspender
into
a
belt
,
raked
away
some
brush
behind
the
rotten
log
,
*NL*
disclosing
a
rude
bow
and
arrow
,
a
lath
sword
and
a
tin
trumpet
,
and
*NL*
in
a
moment
had
seized
these
things
and
bounded
away
,
barelegged
,
*NL*
with
fluttering
shirt
.
He
presently
halted
under
a
great
elm
,
blew
an
*NL*
answering
blast
,
and
then
began
to
tiptoe
and
look
warily
out
,
this
way
*NL*
and
that
.
He
said
cautiously
--
to
an
imaginary
company
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
my
merry
men
!
Keep
hid
till
I
blow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
appeared
Joe
Harper
,
as
airily
clad
and
elaborately
armed
as
Tom
.
*NL*
Tom
called
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
Who
comes
here
into
Sherwood
Forest
without
my
pass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guy
of
Guisborne
wants
no
man
's
pass
.
Who
art
thou
that
--
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dares
to
hold
such
language
,
''
said
Tom
,
prompting
--
for
they
talked
``
by
*NL*
the
book
,
''
from
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
art
thou
that
dares
to
hold
such
language
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
indeed
!
I
am
Robin
Hood
,
as
thy
caitiff
carcase
soon
shall
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
art
thou
indeed
that
famous
outlaw
?
Right
gladly
will
I
dispute
*NL*
with
thee
the
passes
of
the
merry
wood
.
Have
at
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
took
their
lath
swords
,
dumped
their
other
traps
on
the
ground
,
*NL*
struck
a
fencing
attitude
,
foot
to
foot
,
and
began
a
grave
,
careful
*NL*
combat
,
``
two
up
and
two
down
.
''
Presently
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
if
you
've
got
the
hang
,
go
it
lively
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
``
went
it
lively
,
''
panting
and
perspiring
with
the
work
.
By
and
*NL*
by
Tom
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fall
!
fall
!
Why
do
n't
you
fall
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
sha

Why
do
n't
you
fall
yourself
?
You
're
getting
the
worst
of
*NL*
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
that
ai
n't
anything

I
ca
n't

the
way
it
is
in
the
*NL*
book
.
The
book
says
,
`
Then
with
one
back-handed
stroke
he
slew
poor
Guy
*NL*
of
Guisborne
.
'
You
're
to
turn
around
and
let
me
hit
you
in
the
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
getting
around
the
authorities
,
so
Joe
turned
,
received
the
*NL*
whack
and
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Joe
,
getting
up
,
``
you
got
to
let
me
kill
_
you
_
.
That
's
*NL*
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
ca
n't
do
that
,
it
ai
n't
in
the
book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
blamed
mean
--
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
say
,
Joe
,
you
can
be
Friar
Tuck
or
Much
the
miller
's
son
,
and
lam
*NL*
me
with
a
quarter-staff
;
or
I
'll
be
the
Sheriff
of
Nottingham
and
you
be
*NL*
Robin
Hood
a
little
while
and
kill
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
satisfactory
,
and
so
these
adventures
were
carried
out
.
Then
*NL*
Tom
became
Robin
Hood
again
,
and
was
allowed
by
the
treacherous
nun
to
*NL*
bleed
his
strength
away
through
his
neglected
wound
.
And
at
last
Joe
,
*NL*
representing
a
whole
tribe
of
weeping
outlaws
,
dragged
him
sadly
forth
,
*NL*
gave
his
bow
into
his
feeble
hands
,
and
Tom
said
,
``
Where
this
arrow
*NL*
falls
,
there
bury
poor
Robin
Hood
under
the
greenwood
tree
.
''
Then
he
*NL*
shot
the
arrow
and
fell
back
and
would
have
died
,
but
he
lit
on
a
nettle
*NL*
and
sprang
up
too
gaily
for
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
dressed
themselves
,
hid
their
accoutrements
,
and
went
off
*NL*
grieving
that
there
were
no
outlaws
any
more
,
and
wondering
what
modern
*NL*
civilization
could
claim
to
have
done
to
compensate
for
their
loss
.
*NL*
They
said
they
would
rather
be
outlaws
a
year
in
Sherwood
Forest
than
*NL*
President
of
the
United
States
forever
.

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
AT
half-past
nine
,
that
night
,
Tom
and
Sid
were
sent
to
bed
,
as
usual
.
*NL*
They
said
their
prayers
,
and
Sid
was
soon
asleep
.
Tom
lay
awake
and
*NL*
waited
,
in
restless
impatience
.
When
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
must
be
*NL*
nearly
daylight
,
he
heard
the
clock
strike
ten
!
This
was
despair
.
He
*NL*
would
have
tossed
and
fidgeted
,
as
his
nerves
demanded
,
but
he
was
*NL*
afraid
he
might
wake
Sid
.
So
he
lay
still
,
and
stared
up
into
the
dark
.
*NL*
Everything
was
dismally
still
.
By
and
by
,
out
of
the
stillness
,
little
,
*NL*
scarcely
perceptible
noises
began
to
emphasize
themselves
.
The
ticking
*NL*
of
the
clock
began
to
bring
itself
into
notice
.
Old
beams
began
to
crack
*NL*
mysteriously
.
The
stairs
creaked
faintly
.
Evidently
spirits
were
abroad
.
*NL*
A
measured
,
muffled
snore
issued
from
Aunt
Polly
's
chamber
.
And
now
the
*NL*
tiresome
chirping
of
a
cricket
that
no
human
ingenuity
could
locate
,
*NL*
began
.
Next
the
ghastly
ticking
of
a
death-watch
in
the
wall
at
the
*NL*
bed
's
head
made
Tom
shudder
--
it
meant
that
somebody
's
days
were
numbered
.
*NL*
Then
the
howl
of
a
far-off
dog
rose
on
the
night
air
,
and
was
answered
*NL*
by
a
fainter
howl
from
a
remoter
distance
.
Tom
was
in
an
agony
.
At
last
*NL*
he
was
satisfied
that
time
had
ceased
and
eternity
begun
;
he
began
to
*NL*
doze
,
in
spite
of
himself
;
the
clock
chimed
eleven
,
but
he
did
not
hear
*NL*
it
.
And
then
there
came
,
mingling
with
his
half-formed
dreams
,
a
most
*NL*
melancholy
caterwauling
.
The
raising
of
a
neighboring
window
disturbed
*NL*
him
.
A
cry
of
``
Scat
!
you
devil
!
''
and
the
crash
of
an
empty
bottle
*NL*
against
the
back
of
his
aunt
's
woodshed
brought
him
wide
awake
,
and
a
*NL*
single
minute
later
he
was
dressed
and
out
of
the
window
and
creeping
*NL*
along
the
roof
of
the
``
ell
''
on
all
fours
.
He
``
meow
'd
''
with
caution
once
*NL*
or
twice
,
as
he
went
;
then
jumped
to
the
roof
of
the
woodshed
and
thence
*NL*
to
the
ground
.
Huckleberry
Finn
was
there
,
with
his
dead
cat
.
The
boys
*NL*
moved
off
and
disappeared
in
the
gloom
.
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
they
*NL*
were
wading
through
the
tall
grass
of
the
graveyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
graveyard
of
the
old-fashioned
Western
kind
.
It
was
on
a
hill
,
*NL*
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
the
village
.
It
had
a
crazy
board
fence
*NL*
around
it
,
which
leaned
inward
in
places
,
and
outward
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
time
,
but
stood
upright
nowhere
.
Grass
and
weeds
grew
rank
over
the
*NL*
whole
cemetery
.
All
the
old
graves
were
sunken
in
,
there
was
not
a
*NL*
tombstone
on
the
place
;
round-topped
,
worm-eaten
boards
staggered
over
*NL*
the
graves
,
leaning
for
support
and
finding
none
.
``
Sacred
to
the
memory
*NL*
of
''
So-and-So
had
been
painted
on
them
once
,
but
it
could
no
longer
have
*NL*
been
read
,
on
the
most
of
them
,
now
,
even
if
there
had
been
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
faint
wind
moaned
through
the
trees
,
and
Tom
feared
it
might
be
the
*NL*
spirits
of
the
dead
,
complaining
at
being
disturbed
.
The
boys
talked
*NL*
little
,
and
only
under
their
breath
,
for
the
time
and
the
place
and
the
*NL*
pervading
solemnity
and
silence
oppressed
their
spirits
.
They
found
the
*NL*
sharp
new
heap
they
were
seeking
,
and
ensconced
themselves
within
the
*NL*
protection
of
three
great
elms
that
grew
in
a
bunch
within
a
few
feet
of
*NL*
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
waited
in
silence
for
what
seemed
a
long
time
.
The
hooting
of
*NL*
a
distant
owl
was
all
the
sound
that
troubled
the
dead
stillness
.
Tom
's
*NL*
reflections
grew
oppressive
.
He
must
force
some
talk
.
So
he
said
in
a
*NL*
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hucky
,
do
you
believe
the
dead
people
like
it
for
us
to
be
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huckleberry
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wisht
I
knowed
.
It
's
awful
solemn
like
,
_
ai
n't
_
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
considerable
pause
,
while
the
boys
canvassed
this
matter
*NL*
inwardly
.
Then
Tom
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Hucky
--
do
you
reckon
Hoss
Williams
hears
us
talking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
'
course
he
does
.
Least
his
sperrit
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
,
after
a
pause
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
'd
said
Mister
Williams
.
But
I
never
meant
any
harm
.
Everybody
*NL*
calls
him
Hoss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
body
ca
n't
be
too
partic
`
lar
how
they
talk
`
bout
these-yer
dead
*NL*
people
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
damper
,
and
conversation
died
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Tom
seized
his
comrade
's
arm
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Tom
?
''
And
the
two
clung
together
with
beating
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sh
!
There
't
is
again
!
Did
n't
you
hear
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
Now
you
hear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
Tom
,
they
're
coming
!
They
're
coming
,
sure
.
What
'll
we
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dono
.
Think
they
'll
see
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
they
can
see
in
the
dark
,
same
as
cats

I
wisht

had

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

do

afeard

I
do

believe
they
'll
bother

We

doing
*NL*
any

If
we
keep
perfectly
still
,
maybe
they

at

all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
to
,
Tom
,
but
,
Lord
,
I
'm
all
of
a
shiver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
bent
their
heads
together
and
scarcely
breathed
.
A
muffled
*NL*
sound
of
voices
floated
up
from
the
far
end
of
the
graveyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
See
there
!
''
whispered
Tom
.
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
devil-fire
.
Oh
,
Tom
,
this
is
awful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
vague
figures
approached
through
the
gloom
,
swinging
an
*NL*
old-fashioned
tin
lantern
that
freckled
the
ground
with
innumerable
*NL*
little
spangles
of
light
.
Presently
Huckleberry
whispered
with
a
*NL*
shudder
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
devils
sure
enough
.
Three
of
'em

Lordy
,
Tom
,

're
goners

*NL*
*NL*
``

'll
try

but
do

afeard

n't
going

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
All

What

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
whisper
died
wholly
out
,
now
,
for
the
three
men
had
reached
the
*NL*
grave
and
stood
within
a
few
feet
of
the
boys
'
hiding-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
,
''
said
the
third
voice
;
and
the
owner
of
it
held
the
lantern
*NL*
up
and
revealed
the
face
of
young
Doctor
Robinson
.
*NL*
*NL*
Potter
and
Injun
Joe
were
carrying
a
handbarrow
with
a
rope
and
a
couple
*NL*
of
shovels
on
it
.
They
cast
down
their
load
and
began
to
open
the
grave
.
*NL*
The
doctor
put
the
lantern
at
the
head
of
the
grave
and
came
and
sat
*NL*
down
with
his
back
against
one
of
the
elm
trees
.
He
was
so
close
the
*NL*
boys
could
have
touched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurry
,
men
!
''
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
;
``
the
moon
might
come
out
at
any
*NL*
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
growled
a
response
and
went
on
digging
.
For
some
time
there
was
no
*NL*
noise
but
the
grating
sound
of
the
spades
discharging
their
freight
of
*NL*
mould
and
gravel
.
It
was
very
monotonous
.
Finally
a
spade
struck
upon
*NL*
the
coffin
with
a
dull
woody
accent
,
and
within
another
minute
or
two
*NL*
the
men
had
hoisted
it
out
on
the
ground
.
They
pried
off
the
lid
with
*NL*
their
shovels
,
got
out
the
body
and
dumped
it
rudely
on
the
ground
.
The
*NL*
moon
drifted
from
behind
the
clouds
and
exposed
the
pallid
face
.
*NL*
The
barrow
was
got
ready
and
the
corpse
placed
on
it
,
covered
with
a
*NL*
blanket
,
and
bound
to
its
place
with
the
rope
.
Potter
took
out
a
large
*NL*
spring-knife
and
cut
off
the
dangling
end
of
the
rope
and
then
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
the
cussed
thing
's
ready
,
Sawbones
,
and
you
'll
just
out
with

another
five

or
here
she
stays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
talk
!
''
said
Injun
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
what
does
this
mean
?
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
You
required
your
*NL*
pay
in
advance
,
and
I
've
paid
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
you
done
more
than
that
,
''
said
Injun
Joe
,
approaching
the
*NL*
doctor
,
who
was
now
standing
.
``
Five
years
ago
you
drove
me
away
from
*NL*
your
father
's
kitchen
one
night
,
when
I
come
to
ask
for
something
to
*NL*
eat
,
and
you
said
I
war
n't
there
for
any
good
;
and
when
I
swore
I
'd
get
*NL*
even
with
you
if
it
took
a
hundred
years
,
your
father
had
me
jailed
for
*NL*
a
vagrant
.
Did
you
think
I
'd
forget
?
The
Injun
blood
ai
n't
in
me
for
*NL*
nothing
.
And
now
I
've
_
got
_
you
,
and
you
got
to
_
settle
_
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
threatening
the
doctor
,
with
his
fist
in
his
face
,
by
this
time
.
*NL*
The
doctor
struck
out
suddenly
and
stretched
the
ruffian
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
Potter
dropped
his
knife
,
and
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
now
,
do
n't
you
hit
my
pard
!
''
and
the
next
moment
he
had
grappled
*NL*
with
the
doctor
and
the
two
were
struggling
with
might
and
main
,
*NL*
trampling
the
grass
and
tearing
the
ground
with
their
heels
.
Injun
Joe
*NL*
sprang
to
his
feet
,
his
eyes
flaming
with
passion
,
snatched
up
Potter
's
*NL*
knife
,
and
went
creeping
,
catlike
and
stooping
,
round
and
round
about
*NL*
the
combatants
,
seeking
an
opportunity
.
All
at
once
the
doctor
flung
*NL*
himself
free
,
seized
the
heavy
headboard
of
Williams
'
grave
and
felled
*NL*
Potter
to
the
earth
with
it
--
and
in
the
same
instant
the
half-breed
saw
*NL*
his
chance
and
drove
the
knife
to
the
hilt
in
the
young
man
's
breast
.
He
*NL*
reeled
and
fell
partly
upon
Potter
,
flooding
him
with
his
blood
,
and
in
*NL*
the
same
moment
the
clouds
blotted
out
the
dreadful
spectacle
and
the
*NL*
two
frightened
boys
went
speeding
away
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
when
the
moon
emerged
again
,
Injun
Joe
was
standing
over
the
*NL*
two
forms
,
contemplating
them
.
The
doctor
murmured
inarticulately
,
gave
*NL*
a
long
gasp
or
two
and
was
still
.
The
half-breed
muttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
That
_
score
is
settled
--
damn
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
robbed
the
body
.
After
which
he
put
the
fatal
knife
in
Potter
's
*NL*
open
right
hand
,
and
sat
down
on
the
dismantled
coffin
.
Three
--
four
--
five
*NL*
minutes
passed
,
and
then
Potter
began
to
stir
and
moan
.
His
hand
closed
*NL*
upon
the
knife
;
he
raised
it
,
glanced
at
it
,
and
let
it
fall
,
with
a
*NL*
shudder
.
Then
he
sat
up
,
pushing
the
body
from
him
,
and
gazed
at
it
,
and
*NL*
then
around
him
,
confusedly
.
His
eyes
met
Joe
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
,
how
is
this
,
Joe
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
dirty
business
,
''
said
Joe
,
without
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
do
it
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
!
I
never
done
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
!
That
kind
of
talk
wo
n't
wash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Potter
trembled
and
grew
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
'd
got
sober
.
I
'd
no
business
to
drink
to-night
.
But
it
's
*NL*
in
my
head
yet
--
worse
'n
when
we
started
here
.
I
'm
all
in
a
muddle
;
*NL*
ca
n't
recollect
anything
of
it

hardly

Tell
me

Joe

honest

I

Tell

Oh

awful

him
so
*NL*
young

promising

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

you
two
was
scuffling
,
and
he
fetched
you
one
with
the
headboard
*NL*
and
you
fell
flat
;
and
then
up
you
come
,
all
reeling
and
staggering
*NL*
like
,
and
snatched
the
knife
and
jammed
it
into
him
,
just
as
he
fetched
*NL*
you
another
awful
clip
--
and
here
you
've
laid
,
as
dead
as
a
wedge
til
*NL*
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
did
n't
know
what
I
was
a-doing
.
I
wish
I
may
die
this
minute
if

*NL*
did
.
It
was
all
on
account
of
the
whiskey
and
the
excitement
,
I
reckon
.
*NL*
I
never
used
a
weepon

Do
n't
you

You

wo

you

''
And
the
*NL*
poor
creature
dropped
on
his
knees
before
the
stolid
murderer
,
and
*NL*
clasped
his
appealing
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

always

*NL*
``

began
to
cry
.

*NL*
``
Come

's
enough
of
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
Potter
started
on
a
trot
that
quickly
increased
to
a
run
.
The
half-breed
*NL*
stood
looking
after
him
.
He
muttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
's
as
much
stunned
with
the
lick
and
fuddled
with
the
rum
as
he

had
the
look
of
being
,
he
wo
n't
think
of
the
knife
till
he
's
gone
so
*NL*
far
he
'll
be
afraid
to
come
back
after
it
to
such
a
place
by
*NL*
himself
--
chicken-heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
or
three
minutes
later
the
murdered
man
,
the
blanketed
corpse
,
the
*NL*
lidless
coffin
,
and
the
open
grave
were
under
no
inspection
but
the
*NL*
moon
's
.
The
stillness
was
complete
again

too

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
THE
two
boys
flew
on
and
on
,
toward
the
village
,
speechless
with
*NL*
horror
.
They
glanced
backward
over
their
shoulders
from
time
to
time
,
*NL*
apprehensively
,
as
if
they
feared
they
might
be
followed
.
Every
stump
*NL*
that
started
up
in
their
path
seemed
a
man
and
an
enemy
,
and
made
them
*NL*
catch
their
breath
;
and
as
they
sped
by
some
outlying
cottages
that
lay
*NL*
near
the
village
,
the
barking
of
the
aroused
watch-dogs
seemed
to
give
*NL*
wings
to
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
can
only
get
to
the
old
tannery
before
we
break
down
!
''
whispered
*NL*
Tom
,
in
short
catches
between
breaths
.
``
I
ca
n't
stand
it
much
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huckleberry
's
hard
pantings
were
his
only
reply
,
and
the
boys
fixed
*NL*
their
eyes
on
the
goal
of
their
hopes
and
bent
to
their
work
to
win
it
.
*NL*
They
gained
steadily
on
it
,
and
at
last
,
breast
to
breast
,
they
burst
*NL*
through
the
open
door
and
fell
grateful
and
exhausted
in
the
sheltering
*NL*
shadows
beyond
.
By
and
by
their
pulses
slowed
down
,
and
Tom
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huckleberry
,
what
do
you
reckon
'll
come
of
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Doctor
Robinson
dies
,
I
reckon
hanging
'll
come
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
though
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
_
know
_
it
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
thought
a
while
,
then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
'll
tell
?
We
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
talking
about
?
S'pose
something
happened
and
Injun
Joe
*NL*
_
did
n't
_
hang
?
Why
,
he
'd
kill
us
some
time
or
other
,
just
as
dead
sure
*NL*
as
we
're
a
laying
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
what
I
was
thinking
to
myself
,
Huck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
anybody
tells
,
let
Muff
Potter
do
it
,
if
he
's
fool
enough
.
He
's
*NL*
generally
drunk
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
said
nothing
--
went
on
thinking
.
Presently
he
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
,
Muff
Potter
do
n't
know
it
.
How
can
he
tell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
reason
he
do
n't
know
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
'd
just
got
that
whack
when
Injun
Joe
done
it
.
D'you
reckon
*NL*
he
could
see
anything
?
D'you
reckon
he
knowed
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
hokey
,
that
's
so
,
Tom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
besides
,
look-a-here
--
maybe
that
whack
done
for
_
him
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
`
taint
likely
,
Tom
.
He
had
liquor
in
him
;
I
could
see
that
;
and
*NL*
besides
,
he
always
has
.
Well
,
when
pap
's
full
,
you
might
take
and
belt
*NL*
him
over
the
head
with
a
church
and
you
could
n't
phase
him
.
He
says
so
,
*NL*
his
own
self
.
So
it
's
the
same
with
Muff
Potter
,
of
course
.
But
if
a
man
*NL*
was
dead
sober
,
I
reckon
maybe
that
whack
might
fetch
him
;
I
dono
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
another
reflective
silence
,
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hucky
,
you
sure
you
can
keep
mum
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
we
_
got
_
to
keep
mum
.
You
know
that
.
That
Injun
devil
would
n't
*NL*
make
any
more
of
drownding
us
than
a
couple
of
cats
,
if
we
was
to
squeak
*NL*
`
bout
this
and
they
did
n't
hang
him
.
Now
,
look-a-here
,
Tom
,
less
take
*NL*
and
swear
to
one
another
--
that
's
what
we
got
to
do

swear
to
keep
mum

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
agreed

It
's
the
best
thing

Would
you
just
hold
hands
and
swear
*NL*
that
we

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
that
would
n't
do

That
's
good
enough
for
little
*NL*
rubbishy
common
things

specially
with
gals
,
cuz
_
they
_
go
back
on
you
*NL*
anyway
,
and
blab
if
they
get
in
a
huff
--
but
there
orter
be
writing
`
bout
*NL*
a
big
thing
like
this
.
And
blood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
whole
being
applauded
this
idea
.
It
was
deep
,
and
dark
,
and
awful
;
*NL*
the
hour
,
the
circumstances
,
the
surroundings
,
were
in
keeping
with
it
.
*NL*
He
picked
up
a
clean
pine
shingle
that
lay
in
the
moon-light
,
took
a
*NL*
little
fragment
of
``
red
keel
''
out
of
his
pocket
,
got
the
moon
on
*NL*
his
work
,
and
painfully
scrawled
these
lines
,
emphasizing
each
slow
*NL*
down-stroke
by
clamping
his
tongue
between
his
teeth
,
and
letting
up
the
*NL*
pressure
on
the
up-strokes
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck

dead
in
Their
Tracks
if
They
ever
Tell

Rot

''
*NL*
*NL*
Huckleberry
was
filled
with
admiration
of
Tom
's
facility
in
writing
,
and
*NL*
the
sublimity
of
his
language
.
He
at
once
took
a
pin
from
his
lapel
and
*NL*
was
going
to
prick
his
flesh
,
but
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
!
Do
n't
do
that
.
A
pin
's
brass
.
It
might
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's

*NL*
*NL*
``

You
just
swaller
some
of

you
'll
*NL*
see

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Tom
unwound
the
thread
from
one
of
his
needles
,
and
each
boy
pricked
*NL*
the
ball
of
his
thumb
and
squeezed
out
a
drop
of
blood
.
In
time
,
after
*NL*
many
squeezes
,
Tom
managed
to
sign
his
initials
,
using
the
ball
of
his
*NL*
little
finger
for
a
pen
.
Then
he
showed
Huckleberry
how
to
make
an
H
and
*NL*
an
F
,
and
the
oath
was
complete
.
They
buried
the
shingle
close
to
the
*NL*
wall
,
with
some
dismal
ceremonies
and
incantations
,
and
the
fetters
*NL*
that
bound
their
tongues
were
considered
to
be
locked
and
the
key
thrown
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
figure
crept
stealthily
through
a
break
in
the
other
end
of
the
ruined
*NL*
building
,
now
,
but
they
did
not
notice
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom

''
whispered
Huckleberry
,
``
does
this
keep
us
from

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
reckon
that
's
so

*NL*
*NL*
They
continued
to
whisper
for
some
little
time
.
Presently
a
dog
set
up
*NL*
a
long
,
lugubrious
howl
just
outside
--
within
ten
feet
of
them
.
The
boys
*NL*
clasped
each
other
suddenly
,
in
an
agony
of
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
of

gasped
Huckleberry

*NL*
*NL*
``

spoken

him

quaking
with

put

does
he
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
,
he
must
mean
us
both

we
're
right
together

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom

I
reckon
we

wicked

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dad

it

This
comes
of
playing
hookey

doing
everything

told

I
might

no

I

But

off

I

in
Sunday-schools

And
Tom
began
to
snuffle
a
*NL*
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
bad
!
''
and
Huckleberry
began
to
snuffle
too
.
``
Consound

*NL*
lordy

lordy

I
wisht
I
only
had
half
your
chance

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
choked
off
and
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
,
Hucky
,
look
!
He
's
got
his
_
back
_
to
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hucky
looked
,
with
joy
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
has
,
by
jingoes
!
Did
he
before
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
he
did
.
But
I
,
like
a
fool
,
never
thought
.
Oh
,
this
is
bully
,
you
*NL*
know
.
_
Now
_
who
can
he
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
howling
stopped
.
Tom
pricked
up
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sh
!
What
's
that
?
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sounds
like
--
like
hogs
grunting
.
No
--
it
's
somebody
snoring
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
_
is
_
it
!
Where
`
bouts
is
it
,
Huck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bleeve
it
's
down
at
`
tother
end
.
Sounds
so
,
anyway
.
Pap
used
to
sleep
*NL*
there
,
sometimes
,
`
long
with
the
hogs
,
but
laws
bless
you
,
he
just
lifts
*NL*
things
when
_
he
_
snores
.
Besides
,
I
reckon
he
ai
n't
ever
coming
back
to
*NL*
this
town
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirit
of
adventure
rose
in
the
boys
'
souls
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hucky
,
do
you
das
'
t
to
go
if
I
lead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
,
much
.
Tom
,
s
`
pose
it
's
Injun
Joe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
quailed
.
But
presently
the
temptation
rose
up
strong
again
and
the
*NL*
boys
agreed
to
try
,
with
the
understanding
that
they
would
take
to
their
*NL*
heels
if
the
snoring
stopped
.
So
they
went
tiptoeing
stealthily
down
,
*NL*
the
one
behind
the
other
.
When
they
had
got
to
within
five
steps
of
the
*NL*
snorer
,
Tom
stepped
on
a
stick
,
and
it
broke
with
a
sharp
snap
.
The
man
*NL*
moaned
,
writhed
a
little
,
and
his
face
came
into
the
moonlight
.
It
was
*NL*
Muff
Potter
.
The
boys
'
hearts
had
stood
still
,
and
their
hopes
too
,
*NL*
when
the
man
moved
,
but
their
fears
passed
away
now
.
They
tip-toed
out
,
*NL*
through
the
broken
weather-boarding
,
and
stopped
at
a
little
distance
*NL*
to
exchange
a
parting
word
.
That
long
,
lugubrious
howl
rose
on
the
night
*NL*
air
again
!
They
turned
and
saw
the
strange
dog
standing
within
a
few
*NL*
feet
of
where
Potter
was
lying
,
and
_
facing
_
Potter
,
with
his
nose
*NL*
pointing
heavenward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
geeminy
,
it
's
_
him
_
!
''
exclaimed
both
boys
,
in
a
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Tom
--
they
say
a
stray
dog
come
howling
around
Johnny
Miller
's
*NL*
house
,
`
bout
midnight
,
as
much
as
two
weeks
ago
;
and
a
whippoorwill
come
*NL*
in
and
lit
on
the
banisters
and
sung
,
the
very
same
evening
;
and
there
*NL*
ai
n't
anybody
dead
there
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
know
that
.
And
suppose
there
ai
n't
.
Did
n't
Gracie
Miller
fall
*NL*
in
the
kitchen
fire
and
burn
herself
terrible
the
very
next
Saturday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
she
ai
n't
_
dead
_
.
And
what
's
more
,
she
's
getting
better
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
you
wait
and
see
.
She
's
a
goner
,
just
as
dead
sure
as
Muff
*NL*
Potter
's
a
goner
.
That
's
what
the
niggers
say
,
and
they
know
all
about
*NL*
these
kind
of
things
,
Huck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
separated
,
cogitating
.
When
Tom
crept
in
at
his
bedroom
window
*NL*
the
night
was
almost
spent
.
He
undressed
with
excessive
caution
,
and
*NL*
fell
asleep
congratulating
himself
that
nobody
knew
of
his
escapade
.
He
*NL*
was
not
aware
that
the
gently-snoring
Sid
was
awake
,
and
had
been
so
for
*NL*
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Tom
awoke
,
Sid
was
dressed
and
gone
.
There
was
a
late
look
in
the
*NL*
light
,
a
late
sense
in
the
atmosphere
.
He
was
startled
.
Why
had
he
not
*NL*
been
called
--
persecuted
till
he
was
up
,
as
usual
?
The
thought
filled
*NL*
him
with
bodings
.
Within
five
minutes
he
was
dressed
and
down-stairs
,
*NL*
feeling
sore
and
drowsy
.
The
family
were
still
at
table
,
but
they
had
*NL*
finished
breakfast
.
There
was
no
voice
of
rebuke
;
but
there
were
averted
*NL*
eyes
;
there
was
a
silence
and
an
air
of
solemnity
that
struck
a
chill
*NL*
to
the
culprit
's
heart
.
He
sat
down
and
tried
to
seem
gay
,
but
it
*NL*
was
up-hill
work
;
it
roused
no
smile
,
no
response
,
and
he
lapsed
into
*NL*
silence
and
let
his
heart
sink
down
to
the
depths
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
his
aunt
took
him
aside
,
and
Tom
almost
brightened
in
*NL*
the
hope
that
he
was
going
to
be
flogged
;
but
it
was
not
so
.
His
aunt
*NL*
wept
over
him
and
asked
him
how
he
could
go
and
break
her
old
heart
so
;
*NL*
and
finally
told
him
to
go
on
,
and
ruin
himself
and
bring
her
gray
hairs
*NL*
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
,
for
it
was
no
use
for
her
to
try
any
more
.
*NL*
This
was
worse
than
a
thousand
whippings
,
and
Tom
's
heart
was
sorer
now
*NL*
than
his
body
.
He
cried
,
he
pleaded
for
forgiveness
,
promised
to
reform
*NL*
over
and
over
again
,
and
then
received
his
dismissal
,
feeling
that
*NL*
he
had
won
but
an
imperfect
forgiveness
and
established
but
a
feeble
*NL*
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
presence
too
miserable
to
even
feel
revengeful
toward
*NL*
Sid
;
and
so
the
latter
's
prompt
retreat
through
the
back
gate
was
*NL*
unnecessary
.
He
moped
to
school
gloomy
and
sad
,
and
took
his
flogging
,
*NL*
along
with
Joe
Harper
,
for
playing
hookey
the
day
before
,
with
the
*NL*
air
of
one
whose
heart
was
busy
with
heavier
woes
and
wholly
dead
to
*NL*
trifles
.
Then
he
betook
himself
to
his
seat
,
rested
his
elbows
on
his
*NL*
desk
and
his
jaws
in
his
hands
,
and
stared
at
the
wall
with
the
stony
*NL*
stare
of
suffering
that
has
reached
the
limit
and
can
no
further
go
.
*NL*
His
elbow
was
pressing
against
some
hard
substance
.
After
a
long
time
*NL*
he
slowly
and
sadly
changed
his
position
,
and
took
up
this
object
with
*NL*
a
sigh
.
It
was
in
a
paper
.
He
unrolled
it
.
A
long
,
lingering
,
colossal
*NL*
sigh
followed
,
and
his
heart
broke
.
It
was
his
brass
andiron
knob
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
final
feather
broke
the
camel
's
back
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
CLOSE
upon
the
hour
of
noon
the
whole
village
was
suddenly
electrified
*NL*
with
the
ghastly
news
.
No
need
of
the
as
yet
un-dreamed-of
telegraph
;
*NL*
the
tale
flew
from
man
to
man
,
from
group
to
group
,
from
house
to
house
,
*NL*
with
little
less
than
telegraphic
speed
.
Of
course
the
schoolmaster
gave
*NL*
holi-day
for
that
afternoon
;
the
town
would
have
thought
strangely
of
*NL*
him
if
he
had
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gory
knife
had
been
found
close
to
the
murdered
man
,
and
it
had
been
*NL*
recognized
by
somebody
as
belonging
to
Muff
Potter
--
so
the
story
ran
.
And
*NL*
it
was
said
that
a
belated
citizen
had
come
upon
Potter
washing
himself
*NL*
in
the
``
branch
''
about
one
or
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
that
Potter
*NL*
had
at
once
sneaked
off
--
suspicious
circumstances
,
especially
the
washing
*NL*
which
was
not
a
habit
with
Potter
.
It
was
also
said
that
the
town
had
*NL*
been
ransacked
for
this
``
murderer
''
-LRB-
the
public
are
not
slow
in
the
*NL*
matter
of
sifting
evidence
and
arriving
at
a
verdict
-RRB-
,
but
that
he
*NL*
could
not
be
found
.
Horsemen
had
departed
down
all
the
roads
in
every
*NL*
direction
,
and
the
Sheriff
``
was
confident
''
that
he
would
be
captured
*NL*
before
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
town
was
drifting
toward
the
graveyard
.
Tom
's
heartbreak
*NL*
vanished
and
he
joined
the
procession
,
not
because
he
would
not
*NL*
a
thousand
times
rather
go
anywhere
else
,
but
because
an
awful
,
*NL*
unaccountable
fascination
drew
him
on
.
Arrived
at
the
dreadful
place
,
he
*NL*
wormed
his
small
body
through
the
crowd
and
saw
the
dismal
spectacle
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
an
age
since
he
was
there
before
.
Somebody
pinched
*NL*
his
arm
.
He
turned
,
and
his
eyes
met
Huckleberry
's
.
Then
both
looked
*NL*
elsewhere
at
once
,
and
wondered
if
anybody
had
noticed
anything
in
their
*NL*
mutual
glance
.
But
everybody
was
talking
,
and
intent
upon
the
grisly
*NL*
spectacle
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
fellow
!
''
``
Poor
young
fellow
!
''
``
This
ought
to
be
a
lesson
to
grave
*NL*
robbers
!
''
``
Muff
Potter
'll
hang
for
this
if
they
catch
him
!
''
This
was
the
*NL*
drift
of
remark
;
and
the
minister
said
,
``
It
was
a
judgment
;
His
hand
is
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Tom
shivered
from
head
to
heel
;
for
his
eye
fell
upon
the
stolid
*NL*
face
of
Injun
Joe
.
At
this
moment
the
crowd
began
to
sway
and
struggle
,
*NL*
and
voices
shouted
,
``
It
's
him
!
it
's
him
!
he
's
coming
himself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
Who
?
''
from
twenty
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Muff
Potter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
he
's
stopped
!
--
Look
out
,
he
's
turning
!
Do
n't
let
him
get
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
People
in
the
branches
of
the
trees
over
Tom
's
head
said
he
was
n't
*NL*
trying
to
get
away
--
he
only
looked
doubtful
and
perplexed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Infernal
impudence
!
''
said
a
bystander
;
``
wanted
to
come
and
take
a
quiet
*NL*
look
at
his
work
,
I
reckon
--
did
n't
expect
any
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
fell
apart
,
now
,
and
the
Sheriff
came
through
,
ostentatiously
*NL*
leading
Potter
by
the
arm
.
The
poor
fellow
's
face
was
haggard
,
and
*NL*
his
eyes
showed
the
fear
that
was
upon
him
.
When
he
stood
before
the
*NL*
murdered
man
,
he
shook
as
with
a
palsy
,
and
he
put
his
face
in
his
hands
*NL*
and
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
do
it
,
friends
,
''
he
sobbed
;
''
`
pon
my
word
and
honor
I
never
*NL*
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
accused
you
?
''
shouted
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
shot
seemed
to
carry
home
.
Potter
lifted
his
face
and
looked
around
*NL*
him
with
a
pathetic
hopelessness
in
his
eyes
.
He
saw
Injun
Joe
,
and
*NL*
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Injun
Joe
,
you
promised
me
you
'd
never
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
your
knife
?
''
and
it
was
thrust
before
him
by
the
Sheriff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Potter
would
have
fallen
if
they
had
not
caught
him
and
eased
him
to
the
*NL*
ground
.
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
told
me
'
t
if
I
did
n't
come
back
and
get
--
''
He
shuddered
;
then
*NL*
waved
his
nerveless
hand
with
a
vanquished
gesture
and
said
,
``
Tell
'em
,
*NL*
Joe
,
tell
'em
--
it
ai
n't
any
use
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Huckleberry
and
Tom
stood
dumb
and
staring
,
and
heard
the
*NL*
stony-hearted
liar
reel
off
his
serene
statement
,
they
expecting
every
*NL*
moment
that
the
clear
sky
would
deliver
God
's
lightnings
upon
his
head
,
*NL*
and
wondering
to
see
how
long
the
stroke
was
delayed
.
And
when
he
had
*NL*
finished
and
still
stood
alive
and
whole
,
their
wavering
impulse
to
*NL*
break
their
oath
and
save
the
poor
betrayed
prisoner
's
life
faded
and
*NL*
vanished
away
,
for
plainly
this
miscreant
had
sold
himself
to
Satan
and
*NL*
it
would
be
fatal
to
meddle
with
the
property
of
such
a
power
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
leave
?
What
did
you
want
to
come
here
for
?
''
somebody
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
help
it
--
I
could
n't
help
it
,
''
Potter
moaned
.
``
I
wanted
to
*NL*
run
away
,
but
I
could
n't
seem
to
come
anywhere
but
here
.
''
And
he
fell
to
*NL*
sobbing
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Injun
Joe
repeated
his
statement
,
just
as
calmly
,
a
few
minutes
*NL*
afterward
on
the
inquest
,
under
oath
;
and
the
boys
,
seeing
that
the
*NL*
lightnings
were
still
withheld
,
were
confirmed
in
their
belief
that
*NL*
Joe
had
sold
himself
to
the
devil
.
He
was
now
become
,
to
them
,
the
most
*NL*
balefully
interesting
object
they
had
ever
looked
upon
,
and
they
could
*NL*
not
take
their
fascinated
eyes
from
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
inwardly
resolved
to
watch
him
nights
,
when
opportunity
should
*NL*
offer
,
in
the
hope
of
getting
a
glimpse
of
his
dread
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Injun
Joe
helped
to
raise
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
and
put
it
in
*NL*
a
wagon
for
removal
;
and
it
was
whispered
through
the
shuddering
*NL*
crowd
that
the
wound
bled
a
little
!
The
boys
thought
that
this
happy
*NL*
circumstance
would
turn
suspicion
in
the
right
direction
;
but
they
were
*NL*
disappointed
,
for
more
than
one
villager
remarked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
within
three
feet
of
Muff
Potter
when
it
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
fearful
secret
and
gnawing
conscience
disturbed
his
sleep
for
as
*NL*
much
as
a
week
after
this
;
and
at
breakfast
one
morning
Sid
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
you
pitch
around
and
talk
in
your
sleep
so
much
that
you
keep
me
*NL*
awake
half
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
blanched
and
dropped
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
bad
sign
,
''
said
Aunt
Polly
,
gravely
.
``
What
you
got
on
your
mind
,
*NL*
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
Nothing
'
t
I
know
of
.
''
But
the
boy
's
hand
shook
so
that
he
*NL*
spilled
his
coffee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
do
talk
such
stuff
,
''
Sid
said
.
``
Last
night
you
said
,
`
It
's
*NL*
blood
,
it
's
blood
,
that
's
what
it
is
!
'
You
said
that
over
and
over
.
*NL*
And
you
said
,
`
Do
n't
torment
me
so
--
I
'll
tell
!
'
Tell
_
what
_
?
What
is
it
*NL*
you
'll
tell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
swimming
before
Tom
.
There
is
no
telling
what
might
have
*NL*
happened
,
now
,
but
luckily
the
concern
passed
out
of
Aunt
Polly
's
face
*NL*
and
she
came
to
Tom
's
relief
without
knowing
it
.
She
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sho
!
It
's
that
dreadful
murder
.
I
dream
about
it
most
every
night
*NL*
myself
.
Sometimes
I
dream
it
's
me
that
done
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mary
said
she
had
been
affected
much
the
same
way
.
Sid
seemed
satisfied
.
*NL*
Tom
got
out
of
the
presence
as
quick
as
he
plausibly
could
,
and
after
*NL*
that
he
complained
of
toothache
for
a
week
,
and
tied
up
his
jaws
every
*NL*
night
.
He
never
knew
that
Sid
lay
nightly
watching
,
and
frequently
*NL*
slipped
the
bandage
free
and
then
leaned
on
his
elbow
listening
a
good
*NL*
while
at
a
time
,
and
afterward
slipped
the
bandage
back
to
its
place
*NL*
again
.
Tom
's
distress
of
mind
wore
off
gradually
and
the
toothache
grew
*NL*
irksome
and
was
discarded
.
If
Sid
really
managed
to
make
anything
out
of
*NL*
Tom
's
disjointed
mutterings
,
he
kept
it
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
Tom
that
his
schoolmates
never
would
get
done
holding
*NL*
inquests
on
dead
cats
,
and
thus
keeping
his
trouble
present
to
his
mind
.
*NL*
Sid
noticed
that
Tom
never
was
coroner
at
one
of
these
inquiries
,
*NL*
though
it
had
been
his
habit
to
take
the
lead
in
all
new
enterprises
;
*NL*
he
noticed
,
too
,
that
Tom
never
acted
as
a
witness
--
and
that
was
strange
;
*NL*
and
Sid
did
not
overlook
the
fact
that
Tom
even
showed
a
marked
aversion
*NL*
to
these
inquests
,
and
always
avoided
them
when
he
could
.
Sid
marvelled
,
*NL*
but
said
nothing
.
However
,
even
inquests
went
out
of
vogue
at
last
,
and
*NL*
ceased
to
torture
Tom
's
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
or
two
,
during
this
time
of
sorrow
,
Tom
watched
his
*NL*
opportunity
and
went
to
the
little
grated
jail-window
and
smuggled
such
*NL*
small
comforts
through
to
the
``
murderer
''
as
he
could
get
hold
of
.
The
*NL*
jail
was
a
trifling
little
brick
den
that
stood
in
a
marsh
at
the
edge
*NL*
of
the
village
,
and
no
guards
were
afforded
for
it
;
indeed
,
it
*NL*
was
seldom
occupied
.
These
offerings
greatly
helped
to
ease
Tom
's
*NL*
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
villagers
had
a
strong
desire
to
tar-and-feather
Injun
Joe
and
ride
*NL*
him
on
a
rail
,
for
body-snatching
,
but
so
formidable
was
his
character
*NL*
that
nobody
could
be
found
who
was
willing
to
take
the
lead
in
the
*NL*
matter
,
so
it
was
dropped
.
He
had
been
careful
to
begin
both
of
his
*NL*
inquest-statements
with
the
fight
,
without
confessing
the
grave-robbery
*NL*
that
preceded
it
;
therefore
it
was
deemed
wisest
not
to
try
the
case
in
*NL*
the
courts
at
present
.

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
ONE
of
the
reasons
why
Tom
's
mind
had
drifted
away
from
its
secret
*NL*
troubles
was
,
that
it
had
found
a
new
and
weighty
matter
to
interest
*NL*
itself
about
.
Becky
Thatcher
had
stopped
coming
to
school
.
Tom
had
*NL*
struggled
with
his
pride
a
few
days
,
and
tried
to
``
whistle
her
down
the
*NL*
wind
,
''
but
failed
.
He
began
to
find
himself
hanging
around
her
father
's
*NL*
house
,
nights
,
and
feeling
very
miserable
.
She
was
ill
.
What
if
she
*NL*
should
die
!
There
was
distraction
in
the
thought
.
He
no
longer
took
an
*NL*
interest
in
war
,
nor
even
in
piracy
.
The
charm
of
life
was
gone
;
there
*NL*
was
nothing
but
dreariness
left
.
He
put
his
hoop
away
,
and
his
bat
;
*NL*
there
was
no
joy
in
them
any
more
.
His
aunt
was
concerned
.
She
began
to
*NL*
try
all
manner
of
remedies
on
him
.
She
was
one
of
those
people
who
*NL*
are
infatuated
with
patent
medicines
and
all
new-fangled
methods
of
*NL*
producing
health
or
mending
it
.
She
was
an
inveterate
experimenter
in
*NL*
these
things
.
When
something
fresh
in
this
line
came
out
she
was
in
a
*NL*
fever
,
right
away
,
to
try
it
;
not
on
herself
,
for
she
was
never
ailing
,
*NL*
but
on
anybody
else
that
came
handy
.
She
was
a
subscriber
for
all
the
*NL*
``
Health
''
periodicals
and
phrenological
frauds
;
and
the
solemn
ignorance
*NL*
they
were
inflated
with
was
breath
to
her
nostrils
.
All
the
``
rot
''
they
*NL*
contained
about
ventilation
,
and
how
to
go
to
bed
,
and
how
to
get
up
,
*NL*
and
what
to
eat
,
and
what
to
drink
,
and
how
much
exercise
to
take
,
and
*NL*
what
frame
of
mind
to
keep
one
's
self
in
,
and
what
sort
of
clothing
*NL*
to
wear
,
was
all
gospel
to
her
,
and
she
never
observed
that
her
*NL*
health-journals
of
the
current
month
customarily
upset
everything
they
*NL*
had
recommended
the
month
before
.
She
was
as
simple-hearted
and
honest
*NL*
as
the
day
was
long
,
and
so
she
was
an
easy
victim
.
She
gathered
*NL*
together
her
quack
periodicals
and
her
quack
medicines
,
and
thus
armed
*NL*
with
death
,
went
about
on
her
pale
horse
,
metaphorically
speaking
,
with
*NL*
``
hell
following
after
.
''
But
she
never
suspected
that
she
was
not
an
*NL*
angel
of
healing
and
the
balm
of
Gilead
in
disguise
,
to
the
suffering
*NL*
neighbors
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
treatment
was
new
,
now
,
and
Tom
's
low
condition
was
a
windfall
*NL*
to
her
.
She
had
him
out
at
daylight
every
morning
,
stood
him
up
in
the
*NL*
wood-shed
and
drowned
him
with
a
deluge
of
cold
water
;
then
she
scrubbed
*NL*
him
down
with
a
towel
like
a
file
,
and
so
brought
him
to
;
then
she
*NL*
rolled
him
up
in
a
wet
sheet
and
put
him
away
under
blankets
till
she
*NL*
sweated
his
soul
clean
and
``
the
yellow
stains
of
it
came
through
his
*NL*
pores
''
--
as
Tom
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
notwithstanding
all
this
,
the
boy
grew
more
and
more
melancholy
and
*NL*
pale
and
dejected
.
She
added
hot
baths
,
sitz
baths
,
shower
baths
,
and
*NL*
plunges
.
The
boy
remained
as
dismal
as
a
hearse
.
She
began
to
assist
the
*NL*
water
with
a
slim
oatmeal
diet
and
blister-plasters
.
She
calculated
his
*NL*
capacity
as
she
would
a
jug
's
,
and
filled
him
up
every
day
with
quack
*NL*
cure-alls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
become
indifferent
to
persecution
by
this
time
.
This
phase
*NL*
filled
the
old
lady
's
heart
with
consternation
.
This
indifference
must
*NL*
be
broken
up
at
any
cost
.
Now
she
heard
of
Pain-killer
for
the
first
*NL*
time
.
She
ordered
a
lot
at
once
.
She
tasted
it
and
was
filled
with
*NL*
gratitude
.
It
was
simply
fire
in
a
liquid
form
.
She
dropped
the
water
*NL*
treatment
and
everything
else
,
and
pinned
her
faith
to
Pain-killer
.
*NL*
She
gave
Tom
a
teaspoonful
and
watched
with
the
deepest
anxiety
for
the
*NL*
result
.
Her
troubles
were
instantly
at
rest
,
her
soul
at
peace
again
;
*NL*
for
the
``
indifference
''
was
broken
up
.
The
boy
could
not
have
shown
a
*NL*
wilder
,
heartier
interest
,
if
she
had
built
a
fire
under
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
felt
that
it
was
time
to
wake
up
;
this
sort
of
life
might
be
*NL*
romantic
enough
,
in
his
blighted
condition
,
but
it
was
getting
to
have
*NL*
too
little
sentiment
and
too
much
distracting
variety
about
it
.
So
he
*NL*
thought
over
various
plans
for
relief
,
and
finally
hit
upon
that
of
*NL*
professing
to
be
fond
of
Pain-killer
.
He
asked
for
it
so
often
that
he
*NL*
became
a
nuisance
,
and
his
aunt
ended
by
telling
him
to
help
himself
and
*NL*
quit
bothering
her
.
If
it
had
been
Sid
,
she
would
have
had
no
misgivings
*NL*
to
alloy
her
delight
;
but
since
it
was
Tom
,
she
watched
the
bottle
*NL*
clandestinely
.
She
found
that
the
medicine
did
really
diminish
,
but
it
*NL*
did
not
occur
to
her
that
the
boy
was
mending
the
health
of
a
crack
in
*NL*
the
sitting-room
floor
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Tom
was
in
the
act
of
dosing
the
crack
when
his
aunt
's
yellow
*NL*
cat
came
along
,
purring
,
eyeing
the
teaspoon
avariciously
,
and
begging
*NL*
for
a
taste
.
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ask
for
it
unless
you
want
it
,
Peter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Peter
signified
that
he
did
want
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
better
make
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peter
was
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
've
asked
for
it
,
and
I
'll
give
it
to
you
,
because
there
ai
n't
*NL*
anything
mean
about
me
;
but
if
you
find
you
do
n't
like
it
,
you
must
n't
*NL*
blame
anybody
but
your
own
self
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Peter
was
agreeable
.
So
Tom
pried
his
mouth
open
and
poured
down
*NL*
the
Pain-killer
.
Peter
sprang
a
couple
of
yards
in
the
air
,
and
then
*NL*
delivered
a
war-whoop
and
set
off
round
and
round
the
room
,
banging
*NL*
against
furniture
,
upsetting
flower-pots
,
and
making
general
havoc
.
Next
*NL*
he
rose
on
his
hind
feet
and
pranced
around
,
in
a
frenzy
of
enjoyment
,
*NL*
with
his
head
over
his
shoulder
and
his
voice
proclaiming
his
*NL*
unappeasable
happiness
.
Then
he
went
tearing
around
the
house
again
*NL*
spreading
chaos
and
destruction
in
his
path
.
Aunt
Polly
entered
in
time
*NL*
to
see
him
throw
a
few
double
summersets
,
deliver
a
final
mighty
hurrah
,
*NL*
and
sail
through
the
open
window
,
carrying
the
rest
of
the
flower-pots
*NL*
with
him
.
The
old
lady
stood
petrified
with
astonishment
,
peering
over
*NL*
her
glasses
;
Tom
lay
on
the
floor
expiring
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
what
on
earth
ails
that
cat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
aunt
,
''
gasped
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
never
see
anything
like
it
.
What
did
make
him
act
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deed
I
do
n't
know
,
Aunt
Polly
;
cats
always
act
so
when
they
're
having
a
*NL*
good
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
,
do
they
?
''
There
was
something
in
the
tone
that
made
Tom
*NL*
apprehensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
'm
.
That
is
,
I
believe
they
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
_
do
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
was
bending
down
,
Tom
watching
,
with
interest
emphasized
*NL*
by
anxiety
.
Too
late
he
divined
her
``
drift
.
''
The
handle
of
the
telltale
*NL*
tea-spoon
was
visible
under
the
bed-valance
.
Aunt
Polly
took
it
,
held
it
*NL*
up
.
Tom
winced
,
and
dropped
his
eyes
.
Aunt
Polly
raised
him
by
the
usual
*NL*
handle
--
his
ear
--
and
cracked
his
head
soundly
with
her
thimble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
sir
,
what
did
you
want
to
treat
that
poor
dumb
beast
so
,
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
done
it
out
of
pity
for
him
--
because
he
had
n't
any
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
n't
any
aunt

--
you
numskull
.
What
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaps
.
Because
if
he
'd
had
one
she
'd
a
burnt

out

She
'd
a

roasted
his
bowels
out
of
him

thout
any
more

than
if
he
was
a
*NL*
human
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Polly
felt
a
sudden
pang
of
remorse
.
This
was
putting
the
thing
in
*NL*
a
new
light
;
what
was
cruelty
to
a
cat
_
might
_
be
cruelty
to
a
boy
,
too
.
*NL*
She
began
to
soften
;
she
felt
sorry
.
Her
eyes
watered
a
little
,
and
she
*NL*
put
her
hand
on
Tom
's
head
and
said
gently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
meaning
for
the
best
,
Tom
.
And
,
Tom
,
it
_
did
_
do
you
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
looked
up
in
her
face
with
just
a
perceptible
twinkle
peeping
*NL*
through
his
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
was
meaning
for
the
best
,
aunty
,
and
so
was
I
with
Peter
.
It
*NL*
done
_
him
_
good
,
too
.
I
never
see
him
get
around
so
since
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
go
`
long
with
you
,
Tom
,
before
you
aggravate
me
again
.
And
you
try
*NL*
and
see
if
you
ca
n't
be
a
good
boy
,
for
once
,
and
you
need
n't
take
any
*NL*
more
medicine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
reached
school
ahead
of
time
.
It
was
noticed
that
this
strange
thing
*NL*
had
been
occurring
every
day
latterly
.
And
now
,
as
usual
of
late
,
*NL*
he
hung
about
the
gate
of
the
schoolyard
instead
of
playing
with
his
*NL*
comrades
.
He
was
sick
,
he
said
,
and
he
looked
it
.
He
tried
to
seem
to
*NL*
be
looking
everywhere
but
whither
he
really
was
looking
--
down
the
road
.
*NL*
Presently
Jeff
Thatcher
hove
in
sight
,
and
Tom
's
face
lighted
;
he
gazed
*NL*
a
moment
,
and
then
turned
sorrowfully
away
.
When
Jeff
arrived
,
Tom
*NL*
accosted
him
;
and
``
led
up
''
warily
to
opportunities
for
remark
about
*NL*
Becky
,
but
the
giddy
lad
never
could
see
the
bait
.
Tom
watched
and
*NL*
watched
,
hoping
whenever
a
frisking
frock
came
in
sight
,
and
hating
the
*NL*
owner
of
it
as
soon
as
he
saw
she
was
not
the
right
one
.
At
last
frocks
*NL*
ceased
to
appear
,
and
he
dropped
hopelessly
into
the
dumps
;
he
entered
*NL*
the
empty
schoolhouse
and
sat
down
to
suffer
.
Then
one
more
frock
passed
*NL*
in
at
the
gate
,
and
Tom
's
heart
gave
a
great
bound
.
The
next
instant
he
*NL*
was
out
,
and
``
going
on
''
like
an
Indian
;
yelling
,
laughing
,
chasing
boys
,
*NL*
jumping
over
the
fence
at
risk
of
life
and
limb
,
throwing
handsprings
,
*NL*
standing
on
his
head
--
doing
all
the
heroic
things
he
could
conceive
of
,
*NL*
and
keeping
a
furtive
eye
out
,
all
the
while
,
to
see
if
Becky
Thatcher
*NL*
was
noticing
.
But
she
seemed
to
be
unconscious
of
it
all
;
she
never
*NL*
looked
.
Could
it
be
possible
that
she
was
not
aware
that
he
was
there
?
*NL*
He
carried
his
exploits
to
her
immediate
vicinity
;
came
war-whooping
*NL*
around
,
snatched
a
boy
's
cap
,
hurled
it
to
the
roof
of
the
schoolhouse
,
*NL*
broke
through
a
group
of
boys
,
tumbling
them
in
every
direction
,
and
*NL*
fell
sprawling
,
himself
,
under
Becky
's
nose
,
almost
upsetting
her
--
and
*NL*
she
turned
,
with
her
nose
in
the
air
,
and
he
heard
her
say
:
``
Mf
!
some
*NL*
people
think
they
're
mighty
smart
--
always
showing
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
cheeks
burned
.
He
gathered
himself
up
and
sneaked
off
,
crushed
and
*NL*
crestfallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
TOM
'S
mind
was
made
up
now
.
He
was
gloomy
and
desperate
.
He
was
a
*NL*
forsaken
,
friendless
boy
,
he
said
;
nobody
loved
him
;
when
they
found
out
*NL*
what
they
had
driven
him
to
,
perhaps
they
would
be
sorry
;
he
had
tried
*NL*
to
do
right
and
get
along
,
but
they
would
not
let
him
;
since
nothing
*NL*
would
do
them
but
to
be
rid
of
him
,
let
it
be
so
;
and
let
them
blame
*NL*
_
him
_
for
the
consequences
--
why
should
n't
they
?
What
right
had
the
*NL*
friendless
to
complain
?
Yes
,
they
had
forced
him
to
it
at
last
:
he
would
*NL*
lead
a
life
of
crime
.
There
was
no
choice
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
he
was
far
down
Meadow
Lane
,
and
the
bell
for
school
to
*NL*
``
take
up
''
tinkled
faintly
upon
his
ear
.
He
sobbed
,
now
,
to
think
he
*NL*
should
never
,
never
hear
that
old
familiar
sound
any
more
--
it
was
very
*NL*
hard
,
but
it
was
forced
on
him
;
since
he
was
driven
out
into
the
cold
*NL*
world
,
he
must
submit
--
but
he
forgave
them
.
Then
the
sobs
came
thick
and
*NL*
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
at
this
point
he
met
his
soul
's
sworn
comrade
,
Joe
*NL*
Harper
--
hard-eyed
,
and
with
evidently
a
great
and
dismal
purpose
in
his
*NL*
heart
.
Plainly
here
were
``
two
souls
with
but
a
single
thought
.
''
Tom
,
*NL*
wiping
his
eyes
with
his
sleeve
,
began
to
blubber
out
something
about
*NL*
a
resolution
to
escape
from
hard
usage
and
lack
of
sympathy
at
home
by
*NL*
roaming
abroad
into
the
great
world
never
to
return
;
and
ended
by
hoping
*NL*
that
Joe
would
not
forget
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
transpired
that
this
was
a
request
which
Joe
had
just
been
going
*NL*
to
make
of
Tom
,
and
had
come
to
hunt
him
up
for
that
purpose
.
His
mother
*NL*
had
whipped
him
for
drinking
some
cream
which
he
had
never
tasted
and
*NL*
knew
nothing
about
;
it
was
plain
that
she
was
tired
of
him
and
wished
*NL*
him
to
go
;
if
she
felt
that
way
,
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
but
*NL*
succumb
;
he
hoped
she
would
be
happy
,
and
never
regret
having
driven
her
*NL*
poor
boy
out
into
the
unfeeling
world
to
suffer
and
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
two
boys
walked
sorrowing
along
,
they
made
a
new
compact
to
stand
*NL*
by
each
other
and
be
brothers
and
never
separate
till
death
relieved
*NL*
them
of
their
troubles
.
Then
they
began
to
lay
their
plans
.
Joe
was
for
*NL*
being
a
hermit
,
and
living
on
crusts
in
a
remote
cave
,
and
dying
,
*NL*
some
time
,
of
cold
and
want
and
grief
;
but
after
listening
to
Tom
,
he
*NL*
conceded
that
there
were
some
conspicuous
advantages
about
a
life
of
*NL*
crime
,
and
so
he
consented
to
be
a
pirate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
miles
below
St.
Petersburg
,
at
a
point
where
the
Mississippi
River
*NL*
was
a
trifle
over
a
mile
wide
,
there
was
a
long
,
narrow
,
wooded
island
,
*NL*
with
a
shallow
bar
at
the
head
of
it
,
and
this
offered
well
as
a
*NL*
rendezvous
.
It
was
not
inhabited
;
it
lay
far
over
toward
the
further
*NL*
shore
,
abreast
a
dense
and
almost
wholly
unpeopled
forest
.
So
Jackson
's
*NL*
Island
was
chosen
.
Who
were
to
be
the
subjects
of
their
piracies
was
a
*NL*
matter
that
did
not
occur
to
them
.
Then
they
hunted
up
Huckleberry
Finn
,
*NL*
and
he
joined
them
promptly
,
for
all
careers
were
one
to
him
;
he
was
*NL*
indifferent
.
They
presently
separated
to
meet
at
a
lonely
spot
on
the
*NL*
river-bank
two
miles
above
the
village
at
the
favorite
hour
--
which
was
*NL*
midnight
.
There
was
a
small
log
raft
there
which
they
meant
to
capture
.
*NL*
Each
would
bring
hooks
and
lines
,
and
such
provision
as
he
could
steal
*NL*
in
the
most
dark
and
mysterious
way
--
as
became
outlaws
.
And
before
the
*NL*
afternoon
was
done
,
they
had
all
managed
to
enjoy
the
sweet
glory
of
*NL*
spreading
the
fact
that
pretty
soon
the
town
would
``
hear
something
.
''
All
*NL*
who
got
this
vague
hint
were
cautioned
to
``
be
mum
and
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
About
midnight
Tom
arrived
with
a
boiled
ham
and
a
few
trifles
,
*NL*
and
stopped
in
a
dense
undergrowth
on
a
small
bluff
overlooking
the
*NL*
meeting-place
.
It
was
starlight
,
and
very
still
.
The
mighty
river
lay
*NL*
like
an
ocean
at
rest
.
Tom
listened
a
moment
,
but
no
sound
disturbed
the
*NL*
quiet
.
Then
he
gave
a
low
,
distinct
whistle
.
It
was
answered
from
under
*NL*
the
bluff
.
Tom
whistled
twice
more
;
these
signals
were
answered
in
the
*NL*
same
way
.
Then
a
guarded
voice
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
goes
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
Sawyer
,
the
Black
Avenger
of
the
Spanish
Main
.
Name
your
names
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
Finn
the
Red-Handed
,
and
Joe
Harper
the
Terror
of
the
Seas
.
''
Tom
*NL*
had
furnished
these
titles
,
from
his
favorite
literature
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
well
.
Give
the
countersign
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hoarse
whispers
delivered
the
same
awful
word
simultaneously
to
the
*NL*
brooding
night
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Blood
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Tom
tumbled
his
ham
over
the
bluff
and
let
himself
down
after
it
,
*NL*
tearing
both
skin
and
clothes
to
some
extent
in
the
effort
.
There
was
*NL*
an
easy
,
comfortable
path
along
the
shore
under
the
bluff
,
but
it
lacked
*NL*
the
advantages
of
difficulty
and
danger
so
valued
by
a
pirate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Terror
of
the
Seas
had
brought
a
side
of
bacon
,
and
had
about
worn
*NL*
himself
out
with
getting
it
there
.
Finn
the
Red-Handed
had
stolen
a
*NL*
skillet
and
a
quantity
of
half-cured
leaf
tobacco
,
and
had
also
brought
*NL*
a
few
corn-cobs
to
make
pipes
with
.
But
none
of
the
pirates
smoked
or
*NL*
``
chewed
''
but
himself
.
The
Black
Avenger
of
the
Spanish
Main
said
it
*NL*
would
never
do
to
start
without
some
fire
.
That
was
a
wise
thought
;
*NL*
matches
were
hardly
known
there
in
that
day
.
They
saw
a
fire
smouldering
*NL*
upon
a
great
raft
a
hundred
yards
above
,
and
they
went
stealthily
*NL*
thither
and
helped
themselves
to
a
chunk
.
They
made
an
imposing
*NL*
adventure
of
it
,
saying
,
``
Hist
!
''
every
now
and
then
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
halting
with
finger
on
lip
;
moving
with
hands
on
imaginary
dagger-hilts
;
*NL*
and
giving
orders
in
dismal
whispers
that
if
``
the
foe
''
stirred
,
to
``
let
*NL*
him
have
it
to
the
hilt
,
''
because
``
dead
men
tell
no
tales
.
''
They
knew
*NL*
well
enough
that
the
raftsmen
were
all
down
at
the
village
laying
*NL*
in
stores
or
having
a
spree
,
but
still
that
was
no
excuse
for
their
*NL*
conducting
this
thing
in
an
unpiratical
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
shoved
off
,
presently
,
Tom
in
command
,
Huck
at
the
after
oar
and
*NL*
Joe
at
the
forward
.
Tom
stood
amidships
,
gloomy-browed
,
and
with
folded
*NL*
arms
,
and
gave
his
orders
in
a
low
,
stern
whisper
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Luff
,
and
bring
her
to
the
wind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye-aye
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Steady
,
steady-y-y-y

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Steady

is

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

her
go
off
a
point
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Point
it
is
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
boys
steadily
and
monotonously
drove
the
raft
toward
mid-stream
*NL*
it
was
no
doubt
understood
that
these
orders
were
given
only
for
*NL*
``
style
,
''
and
were
not
intended
to
mean
anything
in
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sail
's
she
carrying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Courses

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
raft
drew
beyond
the
middle
of
the
river
;
the
boys
pointed
her
head
*NL*
right
,
and
then
lay
on
their
oars
.
The
river
was
not
high
,
so
there
was
*NL*
not
more
than
a
two
or
three
mile
current
.
Hardly
a
word
was
said
during
*NL*
the
next
three-quarters
of
an
hour
.
Now
the
raft
was
passing
before
*NL*
the
distant
town
.
Two
or
three
glimmering
lights
showed
where
it
lay
,
*NL*
peacefully
sleeping
,
beyond
the
vague
vast
sweep
of
star-gemmed
water
,
*NL*
unconscious
of
the
tremendous
event
that
was
happening
.
The
Black
*NL*
Avenger
stood
still
with
folded
arms
,
``
looking
his
last
''
upon
the
scene
*NL*
of
his
former
joys
and
his
later
sufferings
,
and
wishing
``
she
''
could
see
*NL*
him
now
,
abroad
on
the
wild
sea
,
facing
peril
and
death
with
dauntless
*NL*
heart
,
going
to
his
doom
with
a
grim
smile
on
his
lips
.
It
was
but
*NL*
a
small
strain
on
his
imagination
to
remove
Jackson
's
Island
beyond
*NL*
eye-shot
of
the
village
,
and
so
he
``
looked
his
last
''
with
a
broken
and
*NL*
satisfied
heart
.
The
other
pirates
were
looking
their
last
,
too
;
and
*NL*
they
all
looked
so
long
that
they
came
near
letting
the
current
drift
*NL*
them
out
of
the
range
of
the
island
.
But
they
discovered
the
danger
in
*NL*
time
,
and
made
shift
to
avert
it
.
About
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
*NL*
raft
grounded
on
the
bar
two
hundred
yards
above
the
head
of
the
island
,
*NL*
and
they
waded
back
and
forth
until
they
had
landed
their
freight
.
Part
*NL*
of
the
little
raft
's
belongings
consisted
of
an
old
sail
,
and
this
they
*NL*
spread
over
a
nook
in
the
bushes
for
a
tent
to
shelter
their
provisions
;
*NL*
but
they
themselves
would
sleep
in
the
open
air
in
good
weather
,
as
*NL*
became
outlaws
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
built
a
fire
against
the
side
of
a
great
log
twenty
or
thirty
steps
*NL*
within
the
sombre
depths
of
the
forest
,
and
then
cooked
some
bacon
in
*NL*
the
frying-pan
for
supper
,
and
used
up
half
of
the
corn
``
pone
''
stock
*NL*
they
had
brought
.
It
seemed
glorious
sport
to
be
feasting
in
that
wild
,
*NL*
free
way
in
the
virgin
forest
of
an
unexplored
and
uninhabited
island
,
*NL*
far
from
the
haunts
of
men
,
and
they
said
they
never
would
return
to
*NL*
civilization
.
The
climbing
fire
lit
up
their
faces
and
threw
its
ruddy
*NL*
glare
upon
the
pillared
tree-trunks
of
their
forest
temple
,
and
upon
the
*NL*
varnished
foliage
and
festooning
vines
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
last
crisp
slice
of
bacon
was
gone
,
and
the
last
allowance
*NL*
of
corn
pone
devoured
,
the
boys
stretched
themselves
out
on
the
grass
,
*NL*
filled
with
contentment
.
They
could
have
found
a
cooler
place
,
but
*NL*
they
would
not
deny
themselves
such
a
romantic
feature
as
the
roasting
*NL*
campfire
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Ai
n't
_
it
gay

said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's

Tom
.
``
What
would
the
boys
say
if
they
could
see
us

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

Well

they
'd
just

to
be
here

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

so

said
Huckleberry
;
``
anyways

I
'm
suited

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
the

said
Tom
.
``
You

have
to
do

anything

Joe
,
*NL*
when
he
's
ashore

has

then

all

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
that
's
so
,
''
said
Joe
,
``
but
I
had
n't

it

*NL*

Tom

people
do

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``

be
a

of
a

You

be
*NL*
a
disgrace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Red-Handed
made
no
response
,
being
better
employed
.
He
had
finished
*NL*
gouging
out
a
cob
,
and
now
he
fitted
a
weed
stem
to
it
,
loaded
it
with
*NL*
tobacco
,
and
was
pressing
a
coal
to
the
charge
and
blowing
a
cloud
of
*NL*
fragrant
smoke
--
he
was
in
the
full
bloom
of
luxurious
contentment
.
The
*NL*
other
pirates
envied
him
this
majestic
vice
,
and
secretly
resolved
to
*NL*
acquire
it
shortly
.
Presently
Huck
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
pirates
have
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
have
just
a
bully
time
--
take
ships
and
burn
them
,
and
get
the
*NL*
money
and
bury
it
in
awful
places
in
their
island
where
there
's
ghosts
*NL*
and
things
to
watch
it
,
and
kill
everybody
in
the
ships
--
make
'em
walk
a
*NL*
plank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
carry
the
women
to
the
island

said
Joe
;
``
they
do
n't
kill
the
*NL*
women

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
assented
Tom
,
``
they
do
n't
kill
the

--
they
're
too
noble
.
And
*NL*
the
women
's
always
beautiful
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
they
wear
the
bulliest
clothes
!
Oh
no
!
All
gold
and
silver
*NL*
and
di
`
monds
,
''
said
Joe
,
with
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
said
Huck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
pirates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
scanned
his
own
clothing
forlornly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
I
ai
n't
dressed
fitten
for
a
pirate
,
''
said
he
,
with
a
*NL*
regretful
pathos
in
his
voice
;
``
but
I
ai
n't
got
none
but
these
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
other
boys
told
him
the
fine
clothes
would
come
fast
enough
,
*NL*
after
they
should
have
begun
their
adventures
.
They
made
him
understand
*NL*
that
his
poor
rags
would
do
to
begin
with
,
though
it
was
customary
for
*NL*
wealthy
pirates
to
start
with
a
proper
wardrobe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
their
talk
died
out
and
drowsiness
began
to
steal
upon
the
*NL*
eyelids
of
the
little
waifs
.
The
pipe
dropped
from
the
fingers
of
the
*NL*
Red-Handed
,
and
he
slept
the
sleep
of
the
conscience-free
and
the
weary
.
*NL*
The
Terror
of
the
Seas
and
the
Black
Avenger
of
the
Spanish
Main
had
*NL*
more
difficulty
in
getting
to
sleep
.
They
said
their
prayers
inwardly
,
*NL*
and
lying
down
,
since
there
was
nobody
there
with
authority
to
make
them
*NL*
kneel
and
recite
aloud
;
in
truth
,
they
had
a
mind
not
to
say
them
at
*NL*
all
,
but
they
were
afraid
to
proceed
to
such
lengths
as
that
,
lest
they
*NL*
might
call
down
a
sudden
and
special
thunderbolt
from
heaven
.
Then
at
*NL*
once
they
reached
and
hovered
upon
the
imminent
verge
of
sleep
--
but
an
*NL*
intruder
came
,
now
,
that
would
not
``
down
.
''
It
was
conscience
.
They
began
*NL*
to
feel
a
vague
fear
that
they
had
been
doing
wrong
to
run
away
;
and
*NL*
next
they
thought
of
the
stolen
meat
,
and
then
the
real
torture
came
.
*NL*
They
tried
to
argue
it
away
by
reminding
conscience
that
they
had
*NL*
purloined
sweetmeats
and
apples
scores
of
times
;
but
conscience
was
not
*NL*
to
be
appeased
by
such
thin
plausibilities
;
it
seemed
to
them
,
in
the
*NL*
end
,
that
there
was
no
getting
around
the
stubborn
fact
that
taking
*NL*
sweetmeats
was
only
``
hooking
,
''
while
taking
bacon
and
hams
and
such
*NL*
valuables
was
plain
simple
stealing
--
and
there
was
a
command
against
that
*NL*
in
the
Bible
.
So
they
inwardly
resolved
that
so
long
as
they
remained
in
*NL*
the
business
,
their
piracies
should
not
again
be
sullied
with
the
*NL*
crime
of
stealing
.
Then
conscience
granted
a
truce
,
and
these
curiously
*NL*
inconsistent
pirates
fell
peacefully
to
sleep
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
Tom
awoke
in
the
morning
,
he
wondered
where
he
was
.
He
sat
up
and
*NL*
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
around
.
Then
he
comprehended
.
It
was
the
cool
*NL*
gray
dawn
,
and
there
was
a
delicious
sense
of
repose
and
peace
in
the
*NL*
deep
pervading
calm
and
silence
of
the
woods
.
Not
a
leaf
stirred
;
not
*NL*
a
sound
obtruded
upon
great
Nature
's
meditation
.
Beaded
dewdrops
stood
*NL*
upon
the
leaves
and
grasses
.
A
white
layer
of
ashes
covered
the
fire
,
*NL*
and
a
thin
blue
breath
of
smoke
rose
straight
into
the
air
.
Joe
and
Huck
*NL*
still
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
far
away
in
the
woods
a
bird
called
;
another
answered
;
presently
*NL*
the
hammering
of
a
woodpecker
was
heard
.
Gradually
the
cool
dim
gray
*NL*
of
the
morning
whitened
,
and
as
gradually
sounds
multiplied
and
life
*NL*
manifested
itself
.
The
marvel
of
Nature
shaking
off
sleep
and
going
*NL*
to
work
unfolded
itself
to
the
musing
boy
.
A
little
green
worm
came
*NL*
crawling
over
a
dewy
leaf
,
lifting
two-thirds
of
his
body
into
the
air
*NL*
from
time
to
time
and
``
sniffing
around
,
''
then
proceeding
again
--
for
he
*NL*
was
measuring
,
Tom
said
;
and
when
the
worm
approached
him
,
of
its
own
*NL*
accord
,
he
sat
as
still
as
a
stone
,
with
his
hopes
rising
and
falling
,
*NL*
by
turns
,
as
the
creature
still
came
toward
him
or
seemed
inclined
to
*NL*
go
elsewhere
;
and
when
at
last
it
considered
a
painful
moment
with
its
*NL*
curved
body
in
the
air
and
then
came
decisively
down
upon
Tom
's
leg
and
*NL*
began
a
journey
over
him
,
his
whole
heart
was
glad
--
for
that
meant
that
*NL*
he
was
going
to
have
a
new
suit
of
clothes
--
without
the
shadow
of
a
*NL*
doubt
a
gaudy
piratical
uniform
.
Now
a
procession
of
ants
appeared
,
*NL*
from
nowhere
in
particular
,
and
went
about
their
labors
;
one
struggled
*NL*
manfully
by
with
a
dead
spider
five
times
as
big
as
itself
in
its
arms
,
*NL*
and
lugged
it
straight
up
a
tree-trunk
.
A
brown
spotted
lady-bug
climbed
*NL*
the
dizzy
height
of
a
grass
blade
,
and
Tom
bent
down
close
to
it
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Lady-bug
,
lady-bug
,
fly
away
home
,
your
house
is
on
fire
,
your
*NL*
children
's
alone
,
''
and
she
took
wing
and
went
off
to
see
about
it
--
which
*NL*
did
not
surprise
the
boy
,
for
he
knew
of
old
that
this
insect
was
*NL*
credulous
about
conflagrations
,
and
he
had
practised
upon
its
simplicity
*NL*
more
than
once
.
A
tumblebug
came
next
,
heaving
sturdily
at
its
ball
,
and
*NL*
Tom
touched
the
creature
,
to
see
it
shut
its
legs
against
its
body
*NL*
and
pretend
to
be
dead
.
The
birds
were
fairly
rioting
by
this
time
.
A
*NL*
catbird
,
the
Northern
mocker
,
lit
in
a
tree
over
Tom
's
head
,
and
trilled
*NL*
out
her
imitations
of
her
neighbors
in
a
rapture
of
enjoyment
;
then
*NL*
a
shrill
jay
swept
down
,
a
flash
of
blue
flame
,
and
stopped
on
a
twig
*NL*
almost
within
the
boy
's
reach
,
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
and
eyed
the
*NL*
strangers
with
a
consuming
curiosity
;
a
gray
squirrel
and
a
big
fellow
*NL*
of
the
``
fox
''
kind
came
skurrying
along
,
sitting
up
at
intervals
to
*NL*
inspect
and
chatter
at
the
boys
,
for
the
wild
things
had
probably
never
*NL*
seen
a
human
being
before
and
scarcely
knew
whether
to
be
afraid
or
not
.
*NL*
All
Nature
was
wide
awake
and
stirring
,
now
;
long
lances
of
sunlight
*NL*
pierced
down
through
the
dense
foliage
far
and
near
,
and
a
few
*NL*
butterflies
came
fluttering
upon
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
stirred
up
the
other
pirates
and
they
all
clattered
away
with
*NL*
a
shout
,
and
in
a
minute
or
two
were
stripped
and
chasing
after
and
*NL*
tumbling
over
each
other
in
the
shallow
limpid
water
of
the
white
*NL*
sandbar
.
They
felt
no
longing
for
the
little
village
sleeping
in
the
*NL*
distance
beyond
the
majestic
waste
of
water
.
A
vagrant
current
or
a
*NL*
slight
rise
in
the
river
had
carried
off
their
raft
,
but
this
only
*NL*
gratified
them
,
since
its
going
was
something
like
burning
the
bridge
*NL*
between
them
and
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
back
to
camp
wonderfully
refreshed
,
glad-hearted
,
and
*NL*
ravenous
;
and
they
soon
had
the
camp-fire
blazing
up
again
.
Huck
found
a
*NL*
spring
of
clear
cold
water
close
by
,
and
the
boys
made
cups
of
broad
oak
*NL*
or
hickory
leaves
,
and
felt
that
water
,
sweetened
with
such
a
wildwood
*NL*
charm
as
that
,
would
be
a
good
enough
substitute
for
coffee
.
While
Joe
*NL*
was
slicing
bacon
for
breakfast
,
Tom
and
Huck
asked
him
to
hold
on
a
*NL*
minute
;
they
stepped
to
a
promising
nook
in
the
river-bank
and
threw
in
*NL*
their
lines
;
almost
immediately
they
had
reward
.
Joe
had
not
had
time
*NL*
to
get
impatient
before
they
were
back
again
with
some
handsome
bass
,
*NL*
a
couple
of
sun-perch
and
a
small
catfish
--
provisions
enough
for
quite
a
*NL*
family
.
They
fried
the
fish
with
the
bacon
,
and
were
astonished
;
for
*NL*
no
fish
had
ever
seemed
so
delicious
before
.
They
did
not
know
that
the
*NL*
quicker
a
fresh-water
fish
is
on
the
fire
after
he
is
caught
the
better
*NL*
he
is
;
and
they
reflected
little
upon
what
a
sauce
open-air
sleeping
,
*NL*
open-air
exercise
,
bathing
,
and
a
large
ingredient
of
hunger
make
,
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
lay
around
in
the
shade
,
after
breakfast
,
while
Huck
had
a
smoke
,
*NL*
and
then
went
off
through
the
woods
on
an
exploring
expedition
.
They
*NL*
tramped
gayly
along
,
over
decaying
logs
,
through
tangled
underbrush
,
*NL*
among
solemn
monarchs
of
the
forest
,
hung
from
their
crowns
to
the
*NL*
ground
with
a
drooping
regalia
of
grape-vines
.
Now
and
then
they
came
*NL*
upon
snug
nooks
carpeted
with
grass
and
jeweled
with
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
plenty
of
things
to
be
delighted
with
,
but
nothing
to
be
*NL*
astonished
at
.
They
discovered
that
the
island
was
about
three
miles
*NL*
long
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
,
and
that
the
shore
it
lay
closest
to
*NL*
was
only
separated
from
it
by
a
narrow
channel
hardly
two
hundred
yards
*NL*
wide
.
They
took
a
swim
about
every
hour
,
so
it
was
close
upon
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
afternoon
when
they
got
back
to
camp
.
They
were
too
hungry
to
*NL*
stop
to
fish
,
but
they
fared
sumptuously
upon
cold
ham
,
and
then
threw
*NL*
themselves
down
in
the
shade
to
talk
.
But
the
talk
soon
began
to
drag
,
*NL*
and
then
died
.
The
stillness
,
the
solemnity
that
brooded
in
the
woods
,
*NL*
and
the
sense
of
loneliness
,
began
to
tell
upon
the
spirits
of
the
boys
.
*NL*
They
fell
to
thinking
.
A
sort
of
undefined
longing
crept
upon
them
.
This
*NL*
took
dim
shape
,
presently
--
it
was
budding
homesickness
.
Even
Finn
the
*NL*
Red-Handed
was
dreaming
of
his
doorsteps
and
empty
hogsheads
.
But
they
*NL*
were
all
ashamed
of
their
weakness
,
and
none
was
brave
enough
to
speak
*NL*
his
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
,
now
,
the
boys
had
been
dully
conscious
of
a
peculiar
*NL*
sound
in
the
distance
,
just
as
one
sometimes
is
of
the
ticking
of
a
*NL*
clock
which
he
takes
no
distinct
note
of
.
But
now
this
mysterious
sound
*NL*
became
more
pronounced
,
and
forced
a
recognition
.
The
boys
started
,
*NL*
glanced
at
each
other
,
and
then
each
assumed
a
listening
attitude
.
There
*NL*
was
a
long
silence
,
profound
and
unbroken
;
then
a
deep
,
sullen
boom
came
*NL*
floating
down
out
of
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
!
''
exclaimed
Joe
,
under
his
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
,
''
said
Tom
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Tai
n't
thunder
,
''
said
Huckleberry
,
in
an
awed
tone
,
``
becuz
thunder
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
!
''
said
Tom
.
``
Listen
--
do
n't
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
a
time
that
seemed
an
age
,
and
then
the
same
muffled
boom
*NL*
troubled
the
solemn
hush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sprang
to
their
feet
and
hurried
to
the
shore
toward
the
town
.
They
*NL*
parted
the
bushes
on
the
bank
and
peered
out
over
the
water
.
The
little
*NL*
steam
ferry-boat
was
about
a
mile
below
the
village
,
drifting
with
the
*NL*
current
.
Her
broad
deck
seemed
crowded
with
people
.
There
were
a
great
*NL*
many
skiffs
rowing
about
or
floating
with
the
stream
in
the
neighborhood
*NL*
of
the
ferryboat
,
but
the
boys
could
not
determine
what
the
men
in
*NL*
them
were
doing
.
Presently
a
great
jet
of
white
smoke
burst
from
the
*NL*
ferryboat
's
side
,
and
as
it
expanded
and
rose
in
a
lazy
cloud
,
that
same
*NL*
dull
throb
of
sound
was
borne
to
the
listeners
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
now
!
''
exclaimed
Tom
;
``
somebody
's
drownded
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
!
''
said
Huck
;
``
they
done
that
last
summer
,
when
Bill
Turner
*NL*
got
drownded
;
they
shoot
a
cannon
over
the
water
,
and
that
makes
*NL*
him
come
up
to
the
top
.
Yes
,
and
they
take
loaves
of
bread
and
put
*NL*
quicksilver
in
'em
and
set
'em
afloat
,
and
wherever
there
's
anybody
*NL*
that
's
drownded
,
they
'll
float
right
there
and
stop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
've
heard
about
that
,
''
said
Joe
.
``
I
wonder
what
makes
the
bread
*NL*
do
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
ai
n't
the
bread
,
so
much
,
''
said
Tom
;
``
I
reckon
it
's
mostly
what
*NL*
they
_
say
_
over
it
before
they
start
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
do
n't
say
anything
over
it
,
''
said
Huck
.
``
I
've
seen
'em
and
*NL*
they
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
funny
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
But
maybe
they
say
it
to
themselves
.
Of
*NL*
_
course
_
they
do
.
Anybody
might
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
boys
agreed
that
there
was
reason
in
what
Tom
said
,
because
*NL*
an
ignorant
lump
of
bread
,
uninstructed
by
an
incantation
,
could
not
*NL*
be
expected
to
act
very
intelligently
when
set
upon
an
errand
of
such
*NL*
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
jings
,
I
wish
I
was
over
there
,
now
,
''
said
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
too
''
said
Huck
``
I
'd
give
heaps
to
know
who
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
still
listened
and
watched
.
Presently
a
revealing
thought
*NL*
flashed
through
Tom
's
mind
,
and
he
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boys
,
I
know
who
's
drownded
--
it
's
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
felt
like
heroes
in
an
instant
.
Here
was
a
gorgeous
triumph
;
they
*NL*
were
missed
;
they
were
mourned
;
hearts
were
breaking
on
their
account
;
*NL*
tears
were
being
shed
;
accusing
memories
of
unkindness
to
these
poor
*NL*
lost
lads
were
rising
up
,
and
unavailing
regrets
and
remorse
were
being
*NL*
indulged
;
and
best
of
all
,
the
departed
were
the
talk
of
the
whole
town
,
*NL*
and
the
envy
of
all
the
boys
,
as
far
as
this
dazzling
notoriety
was
*NL*
concerned
.
This
was
fine
.
It
was
worth
while
to
be
a
pirate
,
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
twilight
drew
on
,
the
ferryboat
went
back
to
her
accustomed
business
*NL*
and
the
skiffs
disappeared
.
The
pirates
returned
to
camp
.
They
were
*NL*
jubilant
with
vanity
over
their
new
grandeur
and
the
illustrious
trouble
*NL*
they
were
making
.
They
caught
fish
,
cooked
supper
and
ate
it
,
and
then
*NL*
fell
to
guessing
at
what
the
village
was
thinking
and
saying
about
them
;
*NL*
and
the
pictures
they
drew
of
the
public
distress
on
their
account
were
*NL*
gratifying
to
look
upon
--
from
their
point
of
view
.
But
when
the
shadows
*NL*
of
night
closed
them
in
,
they
gradually
ceased
to
talk
,
and
sat
gazing
*NL*
into
the
fire
,
with
their
minds
evidently
wandering
elsewhere
.
The
*NL*
excitement
was
gone
,
now
,
and
Tom
and
Joe
could
not
keep
back
thoughts
*NL*
of
certain
persons
at
home
who
were
not
enjoying
this
fine
frolic
as
*NL*
much
as
they
were
.
Misgivings
came
;
they
grew
troubled
and
unhappy
;
a
*NL*
sigh
or
two
escaped
,
unawares
.
By
and
by
Joe
timidly
ventured
upon
a
*NL*
roundabout
``
feeler
''
as
to
how
the
others
might
look
upon
a
return
to
*NL*
civilization
--
not
right
now
,
but
--
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
withered
him
with
derision
!
Huck
,
being
uncommitted
as
yet
,
joined
*NL*
in
with
Tom
,
and
the
waverer
quickly
``
explained
,
''
and
was
glad
to
get
*NL*
out
of
the
scrape
with
as
little
taint
of
chicken-hearted
home-sickness
*NL*
clinging
to
his
garments
as
he
could
.
Mutiny
was
effectually
laid
to
*NL*
rest
for
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
night
deepened
,
Huck
began
to
nod
,
and
presently
to
snore
.
*NL*
Joe
followed
next
.
Tom
lay
upon
his
elbow
motionless
,
for
some
time
,
*NL*
watching
the
two
intently
.
At
last
he
got
up
cautiously
,
on
his
knees
,
*NL*
and
went
searching
among
the
grass
and
the
flickering
reflections
flung
*NL*
by
the
campfire
.
He
picked
up
and
inspected
several
large
semi-cylinders
*NL*
of
the
thin
white
bark
of
a
sycamore
,
and
finally
chose
two
which
seemed
*NL*
to
suit
him
.
Then
he
knelt
by
the
fire
and
painfully
wrote
something
*NL*
upon
each
of
these
with
his
``
red
keel
''
;
one
he
rolled
up
and
put
in
his
*NL*
jacket
pocket
,
and
the
other
he
put
in
Joe
's
hat
and
removed
it
to
a
*NL*
little
distance
from
the
owner
.
And
he
also
put
into
the
hat
certain
*NL*
schoolboy
treasures
of
almost
inestimable
value
--
among
them
a
lump
of
*NL*
chalk
,
an
India-rubber
ball
,
three
fishhooks
,
and
one
of
that
kind
*NL*
of
marbles
known
as
a
``
sure
`
nough
crystal
.
''
Then
he
tiptoed
his
way
*NL*
cautiously
among
the
trees
till
he
felt
that
he
was
out
of
hearing
,
and
*NL*
straightway
broke
into
a
keen
run
in
the
direction
of
the
sandbar
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
Tom
was
in
the
shoal
water
of
the
bar
,
wading
toward
*NL*
the
Illinois
shore
.
Before
the
depth
reached
his
middle
he
was
halfway
*NL*
over
;
the
current
would
permit
no
more
wading
,
now
,
so
he
struck
out
*NL*
confidently
to
swim
the
remaining
hundred
yards
.
He
swam
quartering
*NL*
upstream
,
but
still
was
swept
downward
rather
faster
than
he
had
*NL*
expected
.
However
,
he
reached
the
shore
finally
,
and
drifted
along
till
*NL*
he
found
a
low
place
and
drew
himself
out
.
He
put
his
hand
on
his
jacket
*NL*
pocket
,
found
his
piece
of
bark
safe
,
and
then
struck
through
the
woods
,
*NL*
following
the
shore
,
with
streaming
garments
.
Shortly
before
ten
*NL*
o'clock
he
came
out
into
an
open
place
opposite
the
village
,
and
saw
the
*NL*
ferryboat
lying
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
and
the
high
bank
.
Everything
*NL*
was
quiet
under
the
blinking
stars
.
He
crept
down
the
bank
,
watching
*NL*
with
all
his
eyes
,
slipped
into
the
water
,
swam
three
or
four
strokes
*NL*
and
climbed
into
the
skiff
that
did
``
yawl
''
duty
at
the
boat
's
stern
.
He
*NL*
laid
himself
down
under
the
thwarts
and
waited
,
panting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
the
cracked
bell
tapped
and
a
voice
gave
the
order
to
``
cast
*NL*
off
.
''
A
minute
or
two
later
the
skiff
's
head
was
standing
high
up
,
*NL*
against
the
boat
's
swell
,
and
the
voyage
was
begun
.
Tom
felt
happy
in
*NL*
his
success
,
for
he
knew
it
was
the
boat
's
last
trip
for
the
night
.
At
*NL*
the
end
of
a
long
twelve
or
fifteen
minutes
the
wheels
stopped
,
and
*NL*
Tom
slipped
overboard
and
swam
ashore
in
the
dusk
,
landing
fifty
yards
*NL*
downstream
,
out
of
danger
of
possible
stragglers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
flew
along
unfrequented
alleys
,
and
shortly
found
himself
at
his
*NL*
aunt
's
back
fence
.
He
climbed
over
,
approached
the
``
ell
,
''
and
looked
*NL*
in
at
the
sitting-room
window
,
for
a
light
was
burning
there
.
There
*NL*
sat
Aunt
Polly
,
Sid
,
Mary
,
and
Joe
Harper
's
mother
,
grouped
together
,
*NL*
talking
.
They
were
by
the
bed
,
and
the
bed
was
between
them
and
the
*NL*
door
.
Tom
went
to
the
door
and
began
to
softly
lift
the
latch
;
then
*NL*
he
pressed
gently
and
the
door
yielded
a
crack
;
he
continued
pushing
*NL*
cautiously
,
and
quaking
every
time
it
creaked
,
till
he
judged
he
might
*NL*
squeeze
through
on
his
knees
;
so
he
put
his
head
through
and
began
,
*NL*
warily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
the
candle
blow
so
?
''
said
Aunt
Polly
.
Tom
hurried
up
.
``
Why
,
*NL*
that
door
's
open
,
I
believe
.
Why
,
of
course
it
is
.
No
end
of
strange
*NL*
things
now
.
Go
`
long
and
shut
it
,
Sid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
disappeared
under
the
bed
just
in
time
.
He
lay
and
``
breathed
''
*NL*
himself
for
a
time
,
and
then
crept
to
where
he
could
almost
touch
his
*NL*
aunt
's
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
I
was
saying
,
''
said
Aunt
Polly
,
``
he
war
n't
_
bad
_
,
so
to
say
--
only
*NL*
misch_ee_vous
.
Only
just
giddy
,
and
harum-scarum
,
you
know
.
He
war
n't
*NL*
any
more
responsible
than
a
colt
.
_
He
_
never
meant
any
harm
,
and
he
was
*NL*
the
best-hearted
boy
that
ever
was
''
--
and
she
began
to
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
just
so
with
my
Joe
--
always
full
of
his
devilment
,
and
up
to
*NL*
every
kind
of
mischief
,
but
he
was
just
as
unselfish
and
kind
as
he
*NL*
could
be
--
and
laws
bless
me
,
to
think
I
went
and
whipped
him
for
taking
*NL*
that
cream
,
never
once
recollecting
that
I
throwed
it
out
myself
because
*NL*
it
was
sour
,
and
I
never
to
see
him
again
in
this
world
,
never
,
never
,
*NL*
never
,
poor
abused
boy
!
''
And
Mrs.
Harper
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
would
*NL*
break
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
Tom
's
better
off
where
he
is
,
''
said
Sid
,
``
but
if
he
'd
been
*NL*
better
in
some
ways
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Sid
!
_
''
Tom
felt
the
glare
of
the
old
lady
's
eye
,
though
he
could
not
*NL*
see
it
.
``
Not
a
word
against
my
Tom
,
now
that
he
's
gone
!
God
'll
take
care
*NL*
of
_
him
_
--
never
you
trouble
_
your_self
,
sir
!
Oh
,
Mrs.
Harper
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
give
him
up
!
I
do
n't
know
how
to
give
him
up
!
He
was
such
a
*NL*
comfort
to
me
,
although
he
tormented
my
old
heart
out
of
me
,
`
most
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lord
giveth
and
the
Lord
hath
taken
away

Blessed
be
the
name
of
*NL*
the
Lord
!
But
it
's
so
hard
--
Oh
,
it
's
so
hard
!
Only
last
Saturday
my
Joe
*NL*
busted
a
firecracker
right
under
my
nose
and
I
knocked
him
sprawling
.
*NL*
Little
did
I
know
then
,
how
soon
--
Oh
,
if
it
was
to
do
over
again
I
'd
hug
*NL*
him
and
bless
him

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
,
I
know
just
how
you
feel
,
Mrs.
Harper
,
I
know
just
*NL*
exactly
how
you
feel
.
No
longer
ago
than
yesterday
noon
,
my
Tom
took
*NL*
and
filled
the
cat
full
of
Pain-killer
,
and
I
did
think
the
cretur
would
*NL*
tear
the
house
down
.
And
God
forgive
me
,
I
cracked
Tom
's
head
with
my
*NL*
thimble
,
poor
boy
,
poor
dead
boy
.
But
he
's
out
of
all
his
troubles
now
.
*NL*
And
the
last
words
I
ever
heard
him
say
was
to
reproach
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
memory
was
too
much
for
the
old
lady
,
and
she
broke
entirely
*NL*
down
.
Tom
was
snuffling
,
now
,
himself
--
and
more
in
pity
of
himself
than
*NL*
anybody
else
.
He
could
hear
Mary
crying
,
and
putting
in
a
kindly
word
*NL*
for
him
from
time
to
time
.
He
began
to
have
a
nobler
opinion
of
himself
*NL*
than
ever
before
.
Still
,
he
was
sufficiently
touched
by
his
aunt
's
grief
*NL*
to
long
to
rush
out
from
under
the
bed
and
overwhelm
her
with
joy
--
and
*NL*
the
theatrical
gorgeousness
of
the
thing
appealed
strongly
to
his
*NL*
nature
,
too
,
but
he
resisted
and
lay
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
listening
,
and
gathered
by
odds
and
ends
that
it
was
*NL*
conjectured
at
first
that
the
boys
had
got
drowned
while
taking
a
swim
;
*NL*
then
the
small
raft
had
been
missed
;
next
,
certain
boys
said
the
missing
*NL*
lads
had
promised
that
the
village
should
``
hear
something
''
soon
;
the
*NL*
wise-heads
had
``
put
this
and
that
together
''
and
decided
that
the
lads
*NL*
had
gone
off
on
that
raft
and
would
turn
up
at
the
next
town
below
,
*NL*
presently
;
but
toward
noon
the
raft
had
been
found
,
lodged
against
the
*NL*
Missouri
shore
some
five
or
six
miles
below
the
village
--
and
then
hope
*NL*
perished
;
they
must
be
drowned
,
else
hunger
would
have
driven
them
home
*NL*
by
nightfall
if
not
sooner
.
It
was
believed
that
the
search
for
the
*NL*
bodies
had
been
a
fruitless
effort
merely
because
the
drowning
must
*NL*
have
occurred
in
mid-channel
,
since
the
boys
,
being
good
swimmers
,
would
*NL*
otherwise
have
escaped
to
shore
.
This
was
Wednesday
night
.
If
the
bodies
*NL*
continued
missing
until
Sunday
,
all
hope
would
be
given
over
,
and
the
*NL*
funerals
would
be
preached
on
that
morning
.
Tom
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Harper
gave
a
sobbing
goodnight
and
turned
to
go
.
Then
with
a
*NL*
mutual
impulse
the
two
bereaved
women
flung
themselves
into
each
other
's
*NL*
arms
and
had
a
good
,
consoling
cry
,
and
then
parted
.
Aunt
Polly
was
*NL*
tender
far
beyond
her
wont
,
in
her
goodnight
to
Sid
and
Mary
.
Sid
*NL*
snuffled
a
bit
and
Mary
went
off
crying
with
all
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Polly
knelt
down
and
prayed
for
Tom
so
touchingly
,
so
appealingly
,
*NL*
and
with
such
measureless
love
in
her
words
and
her
old
trembling
voice
,
*NL*
that
he
was
weltering
in
tears
again
,
long
before
she
was
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
keep
still
long
after
she
went
to
bed
,
for
she
kept
making
*NL*
broken-hearted
ejaculations
from
time
to
time
,
tossing
unrestfully
,
and
*NL*
turning
over
.
But
at
last
she
was
still
,
only
moaning
a
little
in
her
*NL*
sleep
.
Now
the
boy
stole
out
,
rose
gradually
by
the
bedside
,
shaded
the
*NL*
candle-light
with
his
hand
,
and
stood
regarding
her
.
His
heart
was
full
*NL*
of
pity
for
her
.
He
took
out
his
sycamore
scroll
and
placed
it
by
the
*NL*
candle
.
But
something
occurred
to
him
,
and
he
lingered
considering
.
*NL*
His
face
lighted
with
a
happy
solution
of
his
thought
;
he
put
the
bark
*NL*
hastily
in
his
pocket
.
Then
he
bent
over
and
kissed
the
faded
lips
,
and
*NL*
straightway
made
his
stealthy
exit
,
latching
the
door
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threaded
his
way
back
to
the
ferry
landing
,
found
nobody
at
large
*NL*
there
,
and
walked
boldly
on
board
the
boat
,
for
he
knew
she
was
*NL*
tenantless
except
that
there
was
a
watchman
,
who
always
turned
in
and
*NL*
slept
like
a
graven
image
.
He
untied
the
skiff
at
the
stern
,
slipped
*NL*
into
it
,
and
was
soon
rowing
cautiously
upstream
.
When
he
had
pulled
a
*NL*
mile
above
the
village
,
he
started
quartering
across
and
bent
himself
*NL*
stoutly
to
his
work
.
He
hit
the
landing
on
the
other
side
neatly
,
for
*NL*
this
was
a
familiar
bit
of
work
to
him
.
He
was
moved
to
capture
*NL*
the
skiff
,
arguing
that
it
might
be
considered
a
ship
and
therefore
*NL*
legitimate
prey
for
a
pirate
,
but
he
knew
a
thorough
search
would
be
*NL*
made
for
it
and
that
might
end
in
revelations
.
So
he
stepped
ashore
and
*NL*
entered
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
and
took
a
long
rest
,
torturing
himself
meanwhile
to
keep
*NL*
awake
,
and
then
started
warily
down
the
home-stretch
.
The
night
was
far
*NL*
spent
.
It
was
broad
daylight
before
he
found
himself
fairly
abreast
the
*NL*
island
bar
.
He
rested
again
until
the
sun
was
well
up
and
gilding
the
*NL*
great
river
with
its
splendor
,
and
then
he
plunged
into
the
stream
.
A
*NL*
little
later
he
paused
,
dripping
,
upon
the
threshold
of
the
camp
,
and
*NL*
heard
Joe
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Tom
's
true-blue
,
Huck
,
and
he
'll
come
back
.
He
wo
n't
desert
.
He
*NL*
knows
that
would
be
a
disgrace
to
a
pirate
,
and
Tom
's
too
proud
for
that
*NL*
sort
of
thing
.
He
's
up
to
something
or
other
.
Now
I
wonder
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
things
is
ours
,
anyway
,
ai
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
near
,
but
not
yet
,
Huck
.
The
writing
says
they
are
if
he
ai
n't
*NL*
back
here
to
breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
he
is
!
''
exclaimed
Tom
,
with
fine
dramatic
effect
,
stepping
*NL*
grandly
into
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sumptuous
breakfast
of
bacon
and
fish
was
shortly
provided
,
and
as
the
*NL*
boys
set
to
work
upon
it
,
Tom
recounted
-LRB-
and
adorned
-RRB-
his
adventures
.
*NL*
They
were
a
vain
and
boastful
company
of
heroes
when
the
tale
was
done
.
*NL*
Then
Tom
hid
himself
away
in
a
shady
nook
to
sleep
till
noon
,
and
the
*NL*
other
pirates
got
ready
to
fish
and
explore
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
AFTER
dinner
all
the
gang
turned
out
to
hunt
for
turtle
eggs
on
the
bar
.
*NL*
They
went
about
poking
sticks
into
the
sand
,
and
when
they
found
a
soft
*NL*
place
they
went
down
on
their
knees
and
dug
with
their
hands
.
Sometimes
*NL*
they
would
take
fifty
or
sixty
eggs
out
of
one
hole
.
They
were
perfectly
*NL*
round
white
things
a
trifle
smaller
than
an
English
walnut
.
They
had
a
*NL*
famous
fried-egg
feast
that
night
,
and
another
on
Friday
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
they
went
whooping
and
prancing
out
on
the
bar
,
and
*NL*
chased
each
other
round
and
round
,
shedding
clothes
as
they
went
,
until
*NL*
they
were
naked
,
and
then
continued
the
frolic
far
away
up
the
shoal
*NL*
water
of
the
bar
,
against
the
stiff
current
,
which
latter
tripped
their
*NL*
legs
from
under
them
from
time
to
time
and
greatly
increased
the
fun
.
*NL*
And
now
and
then
they
stooped
in
a
group
and
splashed
water
in
each
*NL*
other
's
faces
with
their
palms
,
gradually
approaching
each
other
,
with
*NL*
averted
faces
to
avoid
the
strangling
sprays
,
and
finally
gripping
and
*NL*
struggling
till
the
best
man
ducked
his
neighbor
,
and
then
they
all
*NL*
went
under
in
a
tangle
of
white
legs
and
arms
and
came
up
blowing
,
*NL*
sputtering
,
laughing
,
and
gasping
for
breath
at
one
and
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
well
exhausted
,
they
would
run
out
and
sprawl
on
the
dry
,
*NL*
hot
sand
,
and
lie
there
and
cover
themselves
up
with
it
,
and
by
and
by
*NL*
break
for
the
water
again
and
go
through
the
original
performance
once
*NL*
more
.
Finally
it
occurred
to
them
that
their
naked
skin
represented
*NL*
flesh-colored
``
tights
''
very
fairly
;
so
they
drew
a
ring
in
the
sand
and
*NL*
had
a
circus
--
with
three
clowns
in
it
,
for
none
would
yield
this
proudest
*NL*
post
to
his
neighbor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
they
got
their
marbles
and
played
``
knucks
''
and
``
ringtaw
''
and
*NL*
``
keeps
''
till
that
amusement
grew
stale
.
Then
Joe
and
Huck
had
another
*NL*
swim
,
but
Tom
would
not
venture
,
because
he
found
that
in
kicking
off
*NL*
his
trousers
he
had
kicked
his
string
of
rattlesnake
rattles
off
his
*NL*
ankle
,
and
he
wondered
how
he
had
escaped
cramp
so
long
without
the
*NL*
protection
of
this
mysterious
charm
.
He
did
not
venture
again
until
he
*NL*
had
found
it
,
and
by
that
time
the
other
boys
were
tired
and
ready
to
*NL*
rest
.
They
gradually
wandered
apart
,
dropped
into
the
``
dumps
,
''
and
*NL*
fell
to
gazing
longingly
across
the
wide
river
to
where
the
village
lay
*NL*
drowsing
in
the
sun
.
Tom
found
himself
writing
``
BECKY
''
in
the
sand
with
*NL*
his
big
toe
;
he
scratched
it
out
,
and
was
angry
with
himself
for
his
*NL*
weakness
.
But
he
wrote
it
again
,
nevertheless
;
he
could
not
help
it
.
He
*NL*
erased
it
once
more
and
then
took
himself
out
of
temptation
by
driving
*NL*
the
other
boys
together
and
joining
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Joe
's
spirits
had
gone
down
almost
beyond
resurrection
.
He
was
so
*NL*
homesick
that
he
could
hardly
endure
the
misery
of
it
.
The
tears
lay
*NL*
very
near
the
surface
.
Huck
was
melancholy
,
too
.
Tom
was
downhearted
,
*NL*
but
tried
hard
not
to
show
it
.
He
had
a
secret
which
he
was
not
ready
*NL*
to
tell
,
yet
,
but
if
this
mutinous
depression
was
not
broken
up
soon
,
he
*NL*
would
have
to
bring
it
out
.
He
said
,
with
a
great
show
of
cheerfulness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
there
's
been
pirates
on
this
island
before
,
boys
.
We
'll
explore
*NL*
it
again
.
They
've
hid
treasures
here
somewhere
.
How
'd
you
feel
to
light
*NL*
on
a
rotten
chest
full
of
gold
and
silver
--
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
roused
only
faint
enthusiasm
,
which
faded
out
,
with
no
reply
.
*NL*
Tom
tried
one
or
two
other
seductions
;
but
they
failed
,
too
.
It
was
*NL*
discouraging
work
.
Joe
sat
poking
up
the
sand
with
a
stick
and
looking
*NL*
very
gloomy
.
Finally
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
boys
,
let
's
give
it
up
.
I
want
to
go
home
.
It
's
so
lonesome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
Joe
,
you
'll
feel
better
by
and
by
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
Just
think
of
the
*NL*
fishing
that
's
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
for
fishing
.
I
want
to
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Joe
,
there
ai
n't
such
another
swimming-place
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Swimming
's
no
good
.
I
do
n't
seem
to
care
for
it
,
somehow
,
when
there
*NL*
ai
n't
anybody
to
say
I
sha
'n'
t
go
in
.
I
mean
to
go
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
shucks
!
Baby
!
You
want
to
see
your
mother
,
I
reckon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
_
do
_
want
to
see
my
mother
--
and
you
would
,
too
,
if
you
had
one
.
I
*NL*
ai
n't
any
more
baby
than
you
are
.
''
And
Joe
snuffled
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
'll
let
the
crybaby
go
home
to
his
mother
,
wo
n't
we
,
Huck
?
Poor
*NL*
thing
--
does
it
want
to
see
its
mother
?
And
so
it
shall
.
You
like
it
here
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
,
Huck
?
We
'll
stay
,
wo
n't
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
said
,
``
Y-e-s
''
--
without
any
heart
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
never
speak
to
you
again
as
long
as
I
live
,
''
said
Joe
,
rising
.
*NL*
``
There
now
!
''
And
he
moved
moodily
away
and
began
to
dress
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
cares
!
''
said
Tom
.
``
Nobody
wants
you
to
.
Go
`
long
home
and
get
*NL*
laughed
at
.
Oh
,
you
're
a
nice
pirate

Huck
and
me
ai
n't
crybabies
.
We
'll
*NL*
stay
,
wo
n't
we
,
Huck
?
Let
him
go
if
he
wants
to
.
I
reckon
we
can
get
*NL*
along
without
him
,
per
`
aps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Tom
was
uneasy
,
nevertheless
,
and
was
alarmed
to
see
Joe
go
sullenly
*NL*
on
with
his
dressing
.
And
then
it
was
discomforting
to
see
Huck
eying
*NL*
Joe
's
preparations
so
wistfully
,
and
keeping
up
such
an
ominous
silence
.
*NL*
Presently
,
without
a
parting
word
,
Joe
began
to
wade
off
toward
the
*NL*
Illinois
shore
.
Tom
's
heart
began
to
sink
.
He
glanced
at
Huck
.
Huck
*NL*
could
not
bear
the
look
,
and
dropped
his
eyes
.
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
go
,
too
,
Tom
.
It
was
getting
so
lonesome
anyway
,
and
now
*NL*
it
'll
be
worse
.
Let
's
us
go

too

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo

You
can
all
go

if
you
want
to

I
mean
to
stay

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
I

go

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
`
long
--
who
's
hendering
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
began
to
pick
up
his
scattered
clothes
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
I
wisht
you
'd
come
,
too
.
Now
you
think
it
over
.
We
'll
wait
for
you
*NL*
when
we
get
to
shore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
'll
wait
a
blame
long
time
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
started
sorrowfully
away
,
and
Tom
stood
looking
after
him
,
with
a
*NL*
strong
desire
tugging
at
his
heart
to
yield
his
pride
and
go
along
*NL*
too
.
He
hoped
the
boys
would
stop
,
but
they
still
waded
slowly
on
.
It
*NL*
suddenly
dawned
on
Tom
that
it
was
become
very
lonely
and
still
.
He
made
*NL*
one
final
struggle
with
his
pride
,
and
then
darted
after
his
comrades
,
*NL*
yelling
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
!
Wait
!
I
want
to
tell
you
something
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
presently
stopped
and
turned
around
.
When
he
got
to
where
they
*NL*
were
,
he
began
unfolding
his
secret
,
and
they
listened
moodily
till
*NL*
at
last
they
saw
the
``
point
''
he
was
driving
at
,
and
then
they
set
up
a
*NL*
warwhoop
of
applause
and
said
it
was
``
splendid
!
''
and
said
if
he
had
*NL*
told
them
at
first
,
they
would
n't
have
started
away
.
He
made
a
plausible
*NL*
excuse
;
but
his
real
reason
had
been
the
fear
that
not
even
the
secret
*NL*
would
keep
them
with
him
any
very
great
length
of
time
,
and
so
he
had
*NL*
meant
to
hold
it
in
reserve
as
a
last
seduction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lads
came
gayly
back
and
went
at
their
sports
again
with
a
will
,
*NL*
chattering
all
the
time
about
Tom
's
stupendous
plan
and
admiring
the
*NL*
genius
of
it
.
After
a
dainty
egg
and
fish
dinner
,
Tom
said
he
wanted
to
*NL*
learn
to
smoke
,
now
.
Joe
caught
at
the
idea
and
said
he
would
like
to
*NL*
try
,
too
.
So
Huck
made
pipes
and
filled
them
.
These
novices
had
never
*NL*
smoked
anything
before
but
cigars
made
of
grapevine
,
and
they
``
bit
''
the
*NL*
tongue
,
and
were
not
considered
manly
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
they
stretched
themselves
out
on
their
elbows
and
began
to
puff
,
*NL*
charily
,
and
with
slender
confidence
.
The
smoke
had
an
unpleasant
taste
,
*NL*
and
they
gagged
a
little
,
but
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
just
as
easy
!
If
I
'd
a
knowed
this
was
all
,
I
'd
a
learnt
long
*NL*
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
would
I
,
''
said
Joe
.
``
It
's
just
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
many
a
time
I
've
looked
at
people
smoking
,
and
thought
well
I
wish
*NL*
I
could
do
that
;
but
I
never
thought
I
could
,
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
the
way
with
me
,
hai
n't
it
,
Huck
?
You
've
heard
me
talk
just
*NL*
that
way
--
have
n't
you
,
Huck
?
I
'll
leave
it
to
Huck
if
I
have
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
heaps
of
times
,
''
said
Huck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
too
,
''
said
Tom
;
``
oh
,
hundreds
of
times
.
Once
down
by
the
*NL*
slaughter-house
.
Do
n't
you
remember
,
Huck
?
Bob
Tanner
was
there
,
and
*NL*
Johnny
Miller
,
and
Jeff
Thatcher
,
when
I
said
it
.
Do
n't
you
remember
,
*NL*
Huck
,
`
bout
me
saying
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
so
,
''
said
Huck
.
``
That
was
the
day
after
I
lost
a
white
*NL*
alley
.
No
,
't
was
the
day
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
I
told
you
so
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
Huck
recollects
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bleeve
I
could
smoke
this
pipe
all
day
,
''
said
Joe
.
``
I
do
n't
feel
*NL*
sick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
do
I
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
I
could
smoke
it
all
day
.
But
I
bet
you
Jeff
*NL*
Thatcher
could
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jeff
Thatcher
!
Why
,
he
'd
keel
over
just
with
two
draws
.
Just
let
him
*NL*
try
it
once
.
_
He
'd
_
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
he
would
.
And
Johnny
Miller
--
I
wish
could
see
Johnny
Miller
tackle
*NL*
it
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
I
!
''
said
Joe
.
``
Why
,
I
bet
you
Johnny
Miller
could
n't
any
more
*NL*
do
this
than
nothing
.
Just
one
little
snifter
would
fetch
_
him
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Deed
it
would
,
Joe
.
Say
--
I
wish
the
boys
could
see
us
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
--
boys
,
do
n't
say
anything
about
it
,
and
some
time
when
they
're
*NL*
around
,
I
'll
come
up
to
you
and
say
,
`
Joe
,
got
a
pipe
?
I
want
a
smoke
.
'
*NL*
And
you
'll
say
,
kind
of
careless
like
,
as
if
it
war
n't
anything
,
you
'll
*NL*
say
,
`
Yes
,
I
got
my
_
old
_
pipe
,
and
another
one
,
but
my
tobacker
ai
n't
*NL*
very
good
.
'
And
I
'll
say
,
`
Oh
,
that
's
all
right
,
if
it
's
_
strong
_
*NL*
enough
.
'
And
then
you
'll
out
with
the
pipes
,
and
we
'll
light
up
just
as
*NL*
ca
'm
,
and
then
just
see
'em
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
jings
,
that
'll
be
gay
,
Tom
!
I
wish
it
was
_
now
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
!
And
when
we
tell
'em
we
learned
when
we
was
off
pirating
,
*NL*
wo
n't
they
wish
they
'd
been
along
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
reckon
not
!
I
'll
just
_
bet
_
they
will
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
talk
ran
on
.
But
presently
it
began
to
flag
a
trifle
,
and
*NL*
grow
disjointed
.
The
silences
widened
;
the
expectoration
marvellously
*NL*
increased
.
Every
pore
inside
the
boys
'
cheeks
became
a
spouting
*NL*
fountain
;
they
could
scarcely
bail
out
the
cellars
under
their
tongues
*NL*
fast
enough
to
prevent
an
inundation
;
little
overflowings
down
their
*NL*
throats
occurred
in
spite
of
all
they
could
do
,
and
sudden
retchings
*NL*
followed
every
time
.
Both
boys
were
looking
very
pale
and
miserable
,
*NL*
now
.
Joe
's
pipe
dropped
from
his
nerveless
fingers
.
Tom
's
followed
.
Both
*NL*
fountains
were
going
furiously
and
both
pumps
bailing
with
might
and
*NL*
main
.
Joe
said
feebly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
lost
my
knife
.
I
reckon
I
better
go
and
find
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
said
,
with
quivering
lips
and
halting
utterance
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
help
you
.
You
go
over
that
way
and
I
'll
hunt
around
by
the
spring
.
*NL*
No
,
you
need
n't
come
,
Huck
--
we
can
find
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Huck
sat
down
again
,
and
waited
an
hour
.
Then
he
found
it
lonesome
,
*NL*
and
went
to
find
his
comrades
.
They
were
wide
apart
in
the
woods
,
both
*NL*
very
pale
,
both
fast
asleep
.
But
something
informed
him
that
if
they
had
*NL*
had
any
trouble
they
had
got
rid
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not
talkative
at
supper
that
night
.
They
had
a
humble
look
,
*NL*
and
when
Huck
prepared
his
pipe
after
the
meal
and
was
going
to
prepare
*NL*
theirs
,
they
said
no
,
they
were
not
feeling
very
well
--
something
they
ate
*NL*
at
dinner
had
disagreed
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
midnight
Joe
awoke
,
and
called
the
boys
.
There
was
a
brooding
*NL*
oppressiveness
in
the
air
that
seemed
to
bode
something
.
The
boys
*NL*
huddled
themselves
together
and
sought
the
friendly
companionship
of
*NL*
the
fire
,
though
the
dull
dead
heat
of
the
breathless
atmosphere
was
*NL*
stifling
.
They
sat
still
,
intent
and
waiting
.
The
solemn
hush
continued
.
*NL*
Beyond
the
light
of
the
fire
everything
was
swallowed
up
in
the
*NL*
blackness
of
darkness
.
Presently
there
came
a
quivering
glow
that
*NL*
vaguely
revealed
the
foliage
for
a
moment
and
then
vanished
.
By
and
by
*NL*
another
came
,
a
little
stronger
.
Then
another
.
Then
a
faint
moan
came
*NL*
sighing
through
the
branches
of
the
forest
and
the
boys
felt
a
fleeting
*NL*
breath
upon
their
cheeks
,
and
shuddered
with
the
fancy
that
the
Spirit
*NL*
of
the
Night
had
gone
by
.
There
was
a
pause
.
Now
a
weird
flash
turned
*NL*
night
into
day
and
showed
every
little
grassblade
,
separate
and
*NL*
distinct
,
that
grew
about
their
feet
.
And
it
showed
three
white
,
*NL*
startled
faces
,
too
.
A
deep
peal
of
thunder
went
rolling
and
tumbling
*NL*
down
the
heavens
and
lost
itself
in
sullen
rumblings
in
the
distance
.
A
*NL*
sweep
of
chilly
air
passed
by
,
rustling
all
the
leaves
and
snowing
the
*NL*
flaky
ashes
broadcast
about
the
fire
.
Another
fierce
glare
lit
up
the
*NL*
forest
and
an
instant
crash
followed
that
seemed
to
rend
the
treetops
*NL*
right
over
the
boys
'
heads
.
They
clung
together
in
terror
,
in
the
thick
*NL*
gloom
that
followed
.
A
few
big
raindrops
fell
pattering
upon
the
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
!
boys
,
go
for
the
tent
!
''
exclaimed
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sprang
away
,
stumbling
over
roots
and
among
vines
in
the
dark
,
no
*NL*
two
plunging
in
the
same
direction
.
A
furious
blast
roared
through
*NL*
the
trees
,
making
everything
sing
as
it
went
.
One
blinding
flash
after
*NL*
another
came
,
and
peal
on
peal
of
deafening
thunder
.
And
now
a
drenching
*NL*
rain
poured
down
and
the
rising
hurricane
drove
it
in
sheets
along
the
*NL*
ground
.
The
boys
cried
out
to
each
other
,
but
the
roaring
wind
and
the
*NL*
booming
thunderblasts
drowned
their
voices
utterly
.
However
,
one
by
one
*NL*
they
straggled
in
at
last
and
took
shelter
under
the
tent
,
cold
,
scared
,
*NL*
and
streaming
with
water
;
but
to
have
company
in
misery
seemed
something
*NL*
to
be
grateful
for
.
They
could
not
talk
,
the
old
sail
flapped
so
*NL*
furiously
,
even
if
the
other
noises
would
have
allowed
them
.
The
tempest
*NL*
rose
higher
and
higher
,
and
presently
the
sail
tore
loose
from
its
*NL*
fastenings
and
went
winging
away
on
the
blast
.
The
boys
seized
each
*NL*
others
'
hands
and
fled
,
with
many
tumblings
and
bruises
,
to
the
shelter
*NL*
of
a
great
oak
that
stood
upon
the
riverbank
.
Now
the
battle
was
at
its
*NL*
highest
.
Under
the
ceaseless
conflagration
of
lightning
that
flamed
*NL*
in
the
skies
,
everything
below
stood
out
in
cleancut
and
shadowless
*NL*
distinctness
:
the
bending
trees
,
the
billowy
river
,
white
with
foam
,
the
*NL*
driving
spray
of
spumeflakes
,
the
dim
outlines
of
the
high
bluffs
on
*NL*
the
other
side
,
glimpsed
through
the
drifting
cloudrack
and
the
slanting
*NL*
veil
of
rain
.
Every
little
while
some
giant
tree
yielded
the
fight
*NL*
and
fell
crashing
through
the
younger
growth
;
and
the
unflagging
*NL*
thunderpeals
came
now
in
ear-splitting
explosive
bursts
,
keen
and
sharp
,
*NL*
and
unspeakably
appalling
.
The
storm
culminated
in
one
matchless
effort
*NL*
that
seemed
likely
to
tear
the
island
to
pieces
,
burn
it
up
,
drown
it
to
*NL*
the
treetops
,
blow
it
away
,
and
deafen
every
creature
in
it
,
all
at
one
*NL*
and
the
same
moment
.
It
was
a
wild
night
for
homeless
young
heads
to
be
*NL*
out
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
last
the
battle
was
done
,
and
the
forces
retired
with
weaker
and
*NL*
weaker
threatenings
and
grumblings
,
and
peace
resumed
her
sway
.
The
*NL*
boys
went
back
to
camp
,
a
good
deal
awed
;
but
they
found
there
was
still
*NL*
something
to
be
thankful
for
,
because
the
great
sycamore
,
the
shelter
*NL*
of
their
beds
,
was
a
ruin
,
now
,
blasted
by
the
lightnings
,
and
they
were
*NL*
not
under
it
when
the
catastrophe
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
in
camp
was
drenched
,
the
campfire
as
well
;
for
they
were
but
*NL*
heedless
lads
,
like
their
generation
,
and
had
made
no
provision
against
*NL*
rain
.
Here
was
matter
for
dismay
,
for
they
were
soaked
through
and
*NL*
chilled
.
They
were
eloquent
in
their
distress
;
but
they
presently
*NL*
discovered
that
the
fire
had
eaten
so
far
up
under
the
great
log
it
had
*NL*
been
built
against
-LRB-
where
it
curved
upward
and
separated
itself
from
*NL*
the
ground
-RRB-
,
that
a
handbreadth
or
so
of
it
had
escaped
wetting
;
so
they
*NL*
patiently
wrought
until
,
with
shreds
and
bark
gathered
from
the
under
*NL*
sides
of
sheltered
logs
,
they
coaxed
the
fire
to
burn
again
.
Then
they
*NL*
piled
on
great
dead
boughs
till
they
had
a
roaring
furnace
,
and
were
*NL*
gladhearted
once
more
.
They
dried
their
boiled
ham
and
had
a
feast
,
*NL*
and
after
that
they
sat
by
the
fire
and
expanded
and
glorified
their
*NL*
midnight
adventure
until
morning
,
for
there
was
not
a
dry
spot
to
sleep
*NL*
on
,
anywhere
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
sun
began
to
steal
in
upon
the
boys
,
drowsiness
came
over
*NL*
them
,
and
they
went
out
on
the
sandbar
and
lay
down
to
sleep
.
They
got
*NL*
scorched
out
by
and
by
,
and
drearily
set
about
getting
breakfast
.
After
*NL*
the
meal
they
felt
rusty
,
and
stiff-jointed
,
and
a
little
homesick
once
*NL*
more
.
Tom
saw
the
signs
,
and
fell
to
cheering
up
the
pirates
as
well
as
*NL*
he
could
.
But
they
cared
nothing
for
marbles
,
or
circus
,
or
swimming
,
or
*NL*
anything
.
He
reminded
them
of
the
imposing
secret
,
and
raised
a
ray
of
*NL*
cheer
.
While
it
lasted
,
he
got
them
interested
in
a
new
device
.
This
was
*NL*
to
knock
off
being
pirates
,
for
a
while
,
and
be
Indians
for
a
change
.
*NL*
They
were
attracted
by
this
idea
;
so
it
was
not
long
before
they
were
*NL*
stripped
,
and
striped
from
head
to
heel
with
black
mud
,
like
so
many
*NL*
zebras
--
all
of
them
chiefs
,
of
course
--
and
then
they
went
tearing
through
*NL*
the
woods
to
attack
an
English
settlement
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
they
separated
into
three
hostile
tribes
,
and
darted
upon
each
*NL*
other
from
ambush
with
dreadful
warwhoops
,
and
killed
and
scalped
each
*NL*
other
by
thousands
.
It
was
a
gory
day
.
Consequently
it
was
an
extremely
*NL*
satisfactory
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
assembled
in
camp
toward
suppertime
,
hungry
and
happy
;
but
now
*NL*
a
difficulty
arose
--
hostile
Indians
could
not
break
the
bread
of
*NL*
hospitality
together
without
first
making
peace
,
and
this
was
a
simple
*NL*
impossibility
without
smoking
a
pipe
of
peace
.
There
was
no
other
*NL*
process
that
ever
they
had
heard
of
.
Two
of
the
savages
almost
wished
*NL*
they
had
remained
pirates
.
However
,
there
was
no
other
way
;
so
with
such
*NL*
show
of
cheerfulness
as
they
could
muster
they
called
for
the
pipe
and
*NL*
took
their
whiff
as
it
passed
,
in
due
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
behold
,
they
were
glad
they
had
gone
into
savagery
,
for
they
had
*NL*
gained
something
;
they
found
that
they
could
now
smoke
a
little
without
*NL*
having
to
go
and
hunt
for
a
lost
knife
;
they
did
not
get
sick
enough
to
*NL*
be
seriously
uncomfortable
.
They
were
not
likely
to
fool
away
this
high
*NL*
promise
for
lack
of
effort
.
No
,
they
practised
cautiously
,
after
supper
,
*NL*
with
right
fair
success
,
and
so
they
spent
a
jubilant
evening
.
They
were
*NL*
prouder
and
happier
in
their
new
acquirement
than
they
would
have
been
*NL*
in
the
scalping
and
skinning
of
the
Six
Nations
.
We
will
leave
them
to
*NL*
smoke
and
chatter
and
brag
,
since
we
have
no
further
use
for
them
at
*NL*
present
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
BUT
there
was
no
hilarity
in
the
little
town
that
same
tranquil
Saturday
*NL*
afternoon
.
The
Harpers
,
and
Aunt
Polly
's
family
,
were
being
put
into
*NL*
mourning
,
with
great
grief
and
many
tears
.
An
unusual
quiet
possessed
*NL*
the
village
,
although
it
was
ordinarily
quiet
enough
,
in
all
conscience
.
*NL*
The
villagers
conducted
their
concerns
with
an
absent
air
,
and
talked
*NL*
little
;
but
they
sighed
often
.
The
Saturday
holiday
seemed
a
burden
to
*NL*
the
children
.
They
had
no
heart
in
their
sports
,
and
gradually
gave
them
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
Becky
Thatcher
found
herself
moping
about
the
deserted
*NL*
schoolhouse
yard
,
and
feeling
very
melancholy
.
But
she
found
nothing
*NL*
there
to
comfort
her
.
She
soliloquized
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
I
only
had
a
brass
andiron-knob
again
!
But
I
have
n't
got
*NL*
anything
now
to
remember
him
by
.
''
And
she
choked
back
a
little
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
she
stopped
,
and
said
to
herself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
right
here
.
Oh
,
if
it
was
to
do
over
again
,
I
would
n't
say
*NL*
that
--
I
would
n't
say
it
for
the
whole
world
.
But
he
's
gone
now
;
I
'll
*NL*
never
,
never
,
never
see
him
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
thought
broke
her
down
,
and
she
wandered
away
,
with
tears
rolling
*NL*
down
her
cheeks
.
Then
quite
a
group
of
boys
and
girls
--
playmates
of
Tom
's
*NL*
and
Joe
's
--
came
by
,
and
stood
looking
over
the
paling
fence
and
talking
*NL*
in
reverent
tones
of
how
Tom
did
so-and-so
the
last
time
they
saw
*NL*
him
,
and
how
Joe
said
this
and
that
small
trifle
-LRB-
pregnant
with
awful
*NL*
prophecy
,
as
they
could
easily
see
now
!
-RRB-
--
and
each
speaker
pointed
out
*NL*
the
exact
spot
where
the
lost
lads
stood
at
the
time
,
and
then
added
*NL*
something
like
``
and
I
was
a-standing
just
so
--
just
as
I
am
now
,
and
as
if
*NL*
you
was
him
--
I
was
as
close
as
that
--
and
he
smiled
,
just
this
way
--
and
then
*NL*
something
seemed
to
go
all
over
me
,
like
--
awful
,
you
know
--
and
I
never
*NL*
thought
what
it
meant
,
of
course
,
but
I
can
see
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
a
dispute
about
who
saw
the
dead
boys
last
in
life
,
and
*NL*
many
claimed
that
dismal
distinction
,
and
offered
evidences
,
more
or
*NL*
less
tampered
with
by
the
witness
;
and
when
it
was
ultimately
decided
*NL*
who
_
did
_
see
the
departed
last
,
and
exchanged
the
last
words
with
them
,
*NL*
the
lucky
parties
took
upon
themselves
a
sort
of
sacred
importance
,
*NL*
and
were
gaped
at
and
envied
by
all
the
rest
.
One
poor
chap
,
who
had
*NL*
no
other
grandeur
to
offer
,
said
with
tolerably
manifest
pride
in
the
*NL*
remembrance
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Tom
Sawyer
he
licked
me
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
bid
for
glory
was
a
failure
.
Most
of
the
boys
could
say
that
,
*NL*
and
so
that
cheapened
the
distinction
too
much
.
The
group
loitered
away
,
*NL*
still
recalling
memories
of
the
lost
heroes
,
in
awed
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Sunday-school
hour
was
finished
,
the
next
morning
,
the
bell
*NL*
began
to
toll
,
instead
of
ringing
in
the
usual
way
.
It
was
a
very
still
*NL*
Sabbath
,
and
the
mournful
sound
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
musing
hush
*NL*
that
lay
upon
nature
.
The
villagers
began
to
gather
,
loitering
a
moment
*NL*
in
the
vestibule
to
converse
in
whispers
about
the
sad
event
.
But
there
*NL*
was
no
whispering
in
the
house
;
only
the
funereal
rustling
of
dresses
*NL*
as
the
women
gathered
to
their
seats
disturbed
the
silence
there
.
None
*NL*
could
remember
when
the
little
church
had
been
so
full
before
.
There
*NL*
was
finally
a
waiting
pause
,
an
expectant
dumbness
,
and
then
Aunt
Polly
*NL*
entered
,
followed
by
Sid
and
Mary
,
and
they
by
the
Harper
family
,
all
in
*NL*
deep
black
,
and
the
whole
congregation
,
the
old
minister
as
well
,
rose
*NL*
reverently
and
stood
until
the
mourners
were
seated
in
the
front
pew
.
*NL*
There
was
another
communing
silence
,
broken
at
intervals
by
muffled
*NL*
sobs
,
and
then
the
minister
spread
his
hands
abroad
and
prayed
.
A
moving
*NL*
hymn
was
sung
,
and
the
text
followed
:
``
I
am
the
Resurrection
and
the
*NL*
Life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
service
proceeded
,
the
clergyman
drew
such
pictures
of
the
*NL*
graces
,
the
winning
ways
,
and
the
rare
promise
of
the
lost
lads
that
*NL*
every
soul
there
,
thinking
he
recognized
these
pictures
,
felt
a
pang
*NL*
in
remembering
that
he
had
persistently
blinded
himself
to
them
always
*NL*
before
,
and
had
as
persistently
seen
only
faults
and
flaws
in
the
poor
*NL*
boys
.
The
minister
related
many
a
touching
incident
in
the
lives
of
the
*NL*
departed
,
too
,
which
illustrated
their
sweet
,
generous
natures
,
and
the
*NL*
people
could
easily
see
,
now
,
how
noble
and
beautiful
those
episodes
*NL*
were
,
and
remembered
with
grief
that
at
the
time
they
occurred
they
had
*NL*
seemed
rank
rascalities
,
well
deserving
of
the
cowhide
.
The
congregation
*NL*
became
more
and
more
moved
,
as
the
pathetic
tale
went
on
,
till
at
last
*NL*
the
whole
company
broke
down
and
joined
the
weeping
mourners
in
a
chorus
*NL*
of
anguished
sobs
,
the
preacher
himself
giving
way
to
his
feelings
,
and
*NL*
crying
in
the
pulpit
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rustle
in
the
gallery
,
which
nobody
noticed
;
a
moment
later
*NL*
the
church
door
creaked
;
the
minister
raised
his
streaming
eyes
above
*NL*
his
handkerchief
,
and
stood
transfixed
!
First
one
and
then
another
pair
*NL*
of
eyes
followed
the
minister
's
,
and
then
almost
with
one
impulse
the
*NL*
congregation
rose
and
stared
while
the
three
dead
boys
came
marching
up
*NL*
the
aisle
,
Tom
in
the
lead
,
Joe
next
,
and
Huck
,
a
ruin
of
drooping
rags
,
*NL*
sneaking
sheepishly
in
the
rear
!
They
had
been
hid
in
the
unused
gallery
*NL*
listening
to
their
own
funeral
sermon
!
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Polly
,
Mary
,
and
the
Harpers
threw
themselves
upon
their
restored
*NL*
ones
,
smothered
them
with
kisses
and
poured
out
thanksgivings
,
while
*NL*
poor
Huck
stood
abashed
and
uncomfortable
,
not
knowing
exactly
what
*NL*
to
do
or
where
to
hide
from
so
many
unwelcoming
eyes
.
He
wavered
,
and
*NL*
started
to
slink
away
,
but
Tom
seized
him
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
Polly
,
it
ai
n't
fair
.
Somebody
's
got
to
be
glad
to
see
Huck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
they
shall
.
I
'm
glad
to
see
him
,
poor
motherless
thing
!
''
And
*NL*
the
loving
attentions
Aunt
Polly
lavished
upon
him
were
the
one
thing
*NL*
capable
of
making
him
more
uncomfortable
than
he
was
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
minister
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
:
``
Praise
God
from
*NL*
whom
all
blessings
flow
--
_
sing
_
!
--
and
put
your
hearts
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
did
.
Old
Hundred
swelled
up
with
a
triumphant
burst
,
and
*NL*
while
it
shook
the
rafters
Tom
Sawyer
the
Pirate
looked
around
upon
the
*NL*
envying
juveniles
about
him
and
confessed
in
his
heart
that
this
was
the
*NL*
proudest
moment
of
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
``
sold
''
congregation
trooped
out
they
said
they
would
almost
be
*NL*
willing
to
be
made
ridiculous
again
to
hear
Old
Hundred
sung
like
that
*NL*
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
got
more
cuffs
and
kisses
that
day
--
according
to
Aunt
Polly
's
varying
*NL*
moods
--
than
he
had
earned
before
in
a
year
;
and
he
hardly
knew
which
*NL*
expressed
the
most
gratefulness
to
God
and
affection
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
THAT
was
Tom
's
great
secret
--
the
scheme
to
return
home
with
his
brother
*NL*
pirates
and
attend
their
own
funerals
.
They
had
paddled
over
to
the
*NL*
Missouri
shore
on
a
log
,
at
dusk
on
Saturday
,
landing
five
or
six
miles
*NL*
below
the
village
;
they
had
slept
in
the
woods
at
the
edge
of
the
town
*NL*
till
nearly
daylight
,
and
had
then
crept
through
back
lanes
and
alleys
*NL*
and
finished
their
sleep
in
the
gallery
of
the
church
among
a
chaos
of
*NL*
invalided
benches
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
breakfast
,
Monday
morning
,
Aunt
Polly
and
Mary
were
very
loving
to
*NL*
Tom
,
and
very
attentive
to
his
wants
.
There
was
an
unusual
amount
of
*NL*
talk
.
In
the
course
of
it
Aunt
Polly
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
say
it
was
n't
a
fine
joke
,
Tom
,
to
keep
everybody
*NL*
suffering
`
most
a
week
so
you
boys
had
a
good
time
,
but
it
is
a
pity
you
*NL*
could
be
so
hard-hearted
as
to
let
me
suffer
so
.
If
you
could
come
over
*NL*
on
a
log
to
go
to
your
funeral
,
you
could
have
come
over
and
give
me
a
*NL*
hint
some
way
that
you
war
n't
dead
,
but
only
run
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
could
have
done
that
,
Tom
,
''
said
Mary
;
``
and
I
believe
you
*NL*
would
if
you
had
thought
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
,
Tom
?
''
said
Aunt
Polly
,
her
face
lighting
wistfully
.
``
Say
,
*NL*
now
,
would
you
,
if
you
'd
thought
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
`
Twould
`
a
'
spoiled
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
I
hoped
you
loved
me
that
much
,
''
said
Aunt
Polly
,
with
a
grieved
*NL*
tone
that
discomforted
the
boy
.
``
It
would
have
been
something
if
you
'd
*NL*
cared
enough
to
_
think
_
of
it
,
even
if
you
did
n't
_
do
_
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
auntie
,
that
ai
n't
any
harm
,
''
pleaded
Mary
;
``
it
's
only
Tom
's
giddy
*NL*
way
--
he
is
always
in
such
a
rush
that
he
never
thinks
of
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
's
the
pity
.
Sid
would
have
thought
.
And
Sid
would
have
come
and
*NL*
_
done
_
it
,
too
.
Tom
,
you
'll
look
back
,
some
day
,
when
it
's
too
late
,
*NL*
and
wish
you
'd
cared
a
little
more
for
me
when
it
would
have
cost
you
so
*NL*
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
auntie
,
you
know
I
do
care
for
you
,
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
know
it
better
if
you
acted
more
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
now
I
'd
thought
,
''
said
Tom
,
with
a
repentant
tone
;
``
but
I
dreamt
*NL*
about
you
,
anyway
.
That
's
something
,
ai
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
much
--
a
cat
does
that
much
--
but
it
's
better
than
nothing
.
What
*NL*
did
you
dream
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Wednesday
night
I
dreamt
that
you
was
sitting
over
there
by
the
*NL*
bed
,
and
Sid
was
sitting
by
the
woodbox
,
and
Mary
next
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
so
we
did
.
So
we
always
do

I
'm
glad
your

pressed

she
seized
the

crushing

made

feel
like
the

guiltiest

*NL*
``

audibly

*NL*
*NL*
The
children
left
for
school
,
and
the
old
lady
to
call
on
Mrs.
Harper
*NL*
and
vanquish
her
realism
with
Tom
's
marvellous
dream
.
Sid
had
better
*NL*
judgment
than
to
utter
the
thought
that
was
in
his
mind
as
he
left
the
*NL*
house
.
It
was
this
:
``
Pretty
thin
--
as
long
a
dream
as
that
,
without
any
*NL*
mistakes
in
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
hero
Tom
was
become
,
now
!
He
did
not
go
skipping
and
prancing
,
*NL*
but
moved
with
a
dignified
swagger
as
became
a
pirate
who
felt
that
the
*NL*
public
eye
was
on
him
.
And
indeed
it
was
;
he
tried
not
to
seem
to
see
*NL*
the
looks
or
hear
the
remarks
as
he
passed
along
,
but
they
were
food
and
*NL*
drink
to
him
.
Smaller
boys
than
himself
flocked
at
his
heels
,
as
proud
*NL*
to
be
seen
with
him
,
and
tolerated
by
him
,
as
if
he
had
been
the
drummer
*NL*
at
the
head
of
a
procession
or
the
elephant
leading
a
menagerie
into
*NL*
town
.
Boys
of
his
own
size
pretended
not
to
know
he
had
been
away
at
*NL*
all
;
but
they
were
consuming
with
envy
,
nevertheless
.
They
would
have
*NL*
given
anything
to
have
that
swarthy
sun-tanned
skin
of
his
,
and
his
*NL*
glittering
notoriety
;
and
Tom
would
not
have
parted
with
either
for
a
*NL*
circus
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
school
the
children
made
so
much
of
him
and
of
Joe
,
and
delivered
*NL*
such
eloquent
admiration
from
their
eyes
,
that
the
two
heroes
were
*NL*
not
long
in
becoming
insufferably
``
stuck-up
.
''
They
began
to
tell
their
*NL*
adventures
to
hungry
listeners
--
but
they
only
began
;
it
was
not
a
*NL*
thing
likely
to
have
an
end
,
with
imaginations
like
theirs
to
furnish
*NL*
material
.
And
finally
,
when
they
got
out
their
pipes
and
went
serenely
*NL*
puffing
around
,
the
very
summit
of
glory
was
reached
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
decided
that
he
could
be
independent
of
Becky
Thatcher
now
.
Glory
*NL*
was
sufficient
.
He
would
live
for
glory
.
Now
that
he
was
distinguished
,
*NL*
maybe
she
would
be
wanting
to
``
make
up
.
''
Well
,
let
her
--
she
should
see
*NL*
that
he
could
be
as
indifferent
as
some
other
people
.
Presently
she
*NL*
arrived
.
Tom
pretended
not
to
see
her
.
He
moved
away
and
joined
a
group
*NL*
of
boys
and
girls
and
began
to
talk
.
Soon
he
observed
that
she
was
*NL*
tripping
gayly
back
and
forth
with
flushed
face
and
dancing
eyes
,
*NL*
pretending
to
be
busy
chasing
schoolmates
,
and
screaming
with
laughter
*NL*
when
she
made
a
capture
;
but
he
noticed
that
she
always
made
her
*NL*
captures
in
his
vicinity
,
and
that
she
seemed
to
cast
a
conscious
eye
*NL*
in
his
direction
at
such
times
,
too
.
It
gratified
all
the
vicious
vanity
*NL*
that
was
in
him
;
and
so
,
instead
of
winning
him
,
it
only
``
set
him
up
''
*NL*
the
more
and
made
him
the
more
diligent
to
avoid
betraying
that
he
*NL*
knew
she
was
about
.
Presently
she
gave
over
skylarking
,
and
moved
*NL*
irresolutely
about
,
sighing
once
or
twice
and
glancing
furtively
and
*NL*
wistfully
toward
Tom
.
Then
she
observed
that
now
Tom
was
talking
more
*NL*
particularly
to
Amy
Lawrence
than
to
any
one
else
.
She
felt
a
sharp
pang
*NL*
and
grew
disturbed
and
uneasy
at
once
.
She
tried
to
go
away
,
but
her
*NL*
feet
were
treacherous
,
and
carried
her
to
the
group
instead
.
She
said
to
*NL*
a
girl
almost
at
Tom
's
elbow
--
with
sham
vivacity
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mary
Austin
!
you
bad
girl
,
why
did
n't
you
come
to
Sunday-school
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
come
--
did
n't
you
see
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
!
Did
you
?
Where
did
you
sit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
in
Miss
Peters
'
class
,
where
I
always
go
.
I
saw
_
you
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
?
Why
,
it
's
funny
I
did
n't
see
you
.
I
wanted
to
tell
you
about
*NL*
the
picnic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
jolly
.
Who
's
going
to
give
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
ma
's
going
to
let
me
have
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
goody
;
I
hope
she
'll
let
_
me
_
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
will
.
The
picnic
's
for
me
.
She
'll
let
anybody
come
that
I
*NL*
want
,
and
I
want
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
ever
so
nice
.
When
is
it
going
to
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
and
by
.
Maybe
about
vacation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
wo
n't
it
be
fun
!
You
going
to
have
all
the
girls
and
boys
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
every
one
that
's
friends
to
me
--
or
wants
to
be
''
;
and
she
glanced
*NL*
ever
so
furtively
at
Tom
,
but
he
talked
right
along
to
Amy
Lawrence
*NL*
about
the
terrible
storm
on
the
island
,
and
how
the
lightning
tore
the
*NL*
great
sycamore
tree
``
all
to
flinders
''
while
he
was
``
standing
within
*NL*
three
feet
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
may
I
come
?
''
said
Grace
Miller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
me
?
''
said
Sally
Rogers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
me
,
too
?
''
said
Susy
Harper
.
``
And
Joe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
on
,
with
clapping
of
joyful
hands
till
all
the
group
had
begged
*NL*
for
invitations
but
Tom
and
Amy
.
Then
Tom
turned
coolly
away
,
still
*NL*
talking
,
and
took
Amy
with
him
.
Becky
's
lips
trembled
and
the
tears
*NL*
came
to
her
eyes
;
she
hid
these
signs
with
a
forced
gayety
and
went
on
*NL*
chattering
,
but
the
life
had
gone
out
of
the
picnic
,
now
,
and
out
of
*NL*
everything
else
;
she
got
away
as
soon
as
she
could
and
hid
herself
and
*NL*
had
what
her
sex
call
``
a
good
cry
.
''
Then
she
sat
moody
,
with
wounded
*NL*
pride
,
till
the
bell
rang
.
She
roused
up
,
now
,
with
a
vindictive
cast
*NL*
in
her
eye
,
and
gave
her
plaited
tails
a
shake
and
said
she
knew
what
*NL*
_
she
'd
_
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
recess
Tom
continued
his
flirtation
with
Amy
with
jubilant
*NL*
self-satisfaction
.
And
he
kept
drifting
about
to
find
Becky
and
lacerate
*NL*
her
with
the
performance
.
At
last
he
spied
her
,
but
there
was
a
sudden
*NL*
falling
of
his
mercury
.
She
was
sitting
cosily
on
a
little
bench
behind
*NL*
the
schoolhouse
looking
at
a
picture-book
with
Alfred
Temple
--
and
so
*NL*
absorbed
were
they
,
and
their
heads
so
close
together
over
the
book
,
*NL*
that
they
did
not
seem
to
be
conscious
of
anything
in
the
world
besides
.
*NL*
Jealousy
ran
red-hot
through
Tom
's
veins
.
He
began
to
hate
himself
for
*NL*
throwing
away
the
chance
Becky
had
offered
for
a
reconciliation
.
He
*NL*
called
himself
a
fool
,
and
all
the
hard
names
he
could
think
of
.
He
*NL*
wanted
to
cry
with
vexation
.
Amy
chatted
happily
along
,
as
they
walked
,
*NL*
for
her
heart
was
singing
,
but
Tom
's
tongue
had
lost
its
function
.
He
*NL*
did
not
hear
what
Amy
was
saying
,
and
whenever
she
paused
expectantly
*NL*
he
could
only
stammer
an
awkward
assent
,
which
was
as
often
misplaced
*NL*
as
otherwise
.
He
kept
drifting
to
the
rear
of
the
schoolhouse
,
again
and
*NL*
again
,
to
sear
his
eyeballs
with
the
hateful
spectacle
there
.
He
could
*NL*
not
help
it
.
And
it
maddened
him
to
see
,
as
he
thought
he
saw
,
that
*NL*
Becky
Thatcher
never
once
suspected
that
he
was
even
in
the
land
of
the
*NL*
living
.
But
she
did
see
,
nevertheless
;
and
she
knew
she
was
winning
her
*NL*
fight
,
too
,
and
was
glad
to
see
him
suffer
as
she
had
suffered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
's
happy
prattle
became
intolerable
.
Tom
hinted
at
things
he
had
*NL*
to
attend
to
;
things
that
must
be
done
;
and
time
was
fleeting
.
But
in
*NL*
vain
--
the
girl
chirped
on
.
Tom
thought
,
``
Oh
,
hang
her
,
ai
n't
I
ever
going
*NL*
to
get
rid
of
her
?
''
At
last
he
must
be
attending
to
those
things
--
and
she
*NL*
said
artlessly
that
she
would
be
``
around
''
when
school
let
out
.
And
he
*NL*
hastened
away
,
hating
her
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
other
boy
!
''
Tom
thought
,
grating
his
teeth
.
``
Any
boy
in
the
whole
*NL*
town
but
that
Saint
Louis
smarty
that
thinks
he
dresses
so
fine
and
is
*NL*
aristocracy
!
Oh
,
all
right
,
I
licked
you
the
first
day
you
ever
saw
this
*NL*
town
,
mister
,
and
I
'll
lick
you
again
!
You
just
wait
till
I
catch
you
*NL*
out
!
I
'll
just
take
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
went
through
the
motions
of
thrashing
an
imaginary
boy
--
pummelling
*NL*
the
air
,
and
kicking
and
gouging
.
``
Oh
,
you
do
,
do
you
?
You
holler
*NL*
`
nough
,
do
you
?
Now
,
then
,
let
that
learn
you
!
''
And
so
the
imaginary
*NL*
flogging
was
finished
to
his
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
fled
home
at
noon
.
His
conscience
could
not
endure
any
more
of
Amy
's
*NL*
grateful
happiness
,
and
his
jealousy
could
bear
no
more
of
the
other
*NL*
distress
.
Becky
resumed
her
picture
inspections
with
Alfred
,
but
as
the
*NL*
minutes
dragged
along
and
no
Tom
came
to
suffer
,
her
triumph
began
to
*NL*
cloud
and
she
lost
interest
;
gravity
and
absentmindedness
followed
,
*NL*
and
then
melancholy
;
two
or
three
times
she
pricked
up
her
ear
at
*NL*
a
footstep
,
but
it
was
a
false
hope
;
no
Tom
came
.
At
last
she
grew
*NL*
entirely
miserable
and
wished
she
had
n't
carried
it
so
far
.
When
*NL*
poor
Alfred
,
seeing
that
he
was
losing
her
,
he
did
not
know
how
,
kept
*NL*
exclaiming
:
``
Oh
,
here
's
a
jolly
one
!
look
at
this
!
''
she
lost
patience
at
*NL*
last
,
and
said
,
``
Oh
,
do
n't
bother
me
!
I
do
n't
care
for
them
!
''
and
burst
*NL*
into
tears
,
and
got
up
and
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alfred
dropped
alongside
and
was
going
to
try
to
comfort
her
,
but
she
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
and
leave
me
alone
,
ca
n't
you
!
I
hate
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
boy
halted
,
wondering
what
he
could
have
done
--
for
she
had
said
*NL*
she
would
look
at
pictures
all
through
the
nooning
--
and
she
walked
on
,
*NL*
crying
.
Then
Alfred
went
musing
into
the
deserted
schoolhouse
.
He
was
*NL*
humiliated
and
angry
.
He
easily
guessed
his
way
to
the
truth
--
the
girl
*NL*
had
simply
made
a
convenience
of
him
to
vent
her
spite
upon
Tom
Sawyer
.
*NL*
He
was
far
from
hating
Tom
the
less
when
this
thought
occurred
to
him
.
*NL*
He
wished
there
was
some
way
to
get
that
boy
into
trouble
without
much
*NL*
risk
to
himself
.
Tom
's
spelling-book
fell
under
his
eye
.
Here
was
his
*NL*
opportunity
.
He
gratefully
opened
to
the
lesson
for
the
afternoon
and
*NL*
poured
ink
upon
the
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
Becky
,
glancing
in
at
a
window
behind
him
at
the
moment
,
saw
the
act
,
*NL*
and
moved
on
,
without
discovering
herself
.
She
started
homeward
,
now
,
*NL*
intending
to
find
Tom
and
tell
him
;
Tom
would
be
thankful
and
their
*NL*
troubles
would
be
healed
.
Before
she
was
half
way
home
,
however
,
she
*NL*
had
changed
her
mind
.
The
thought
of
Tom
's
treatment
of
her
when
she
was
*NL*
talking
about
her
picnic
came
scorching
back
and
filled
her
with
shame
.
*NL*
She
resolved
to
let
him
get
whipped
on
the
damaged
spelling-book
's
*NL*
account
,
and
to
hate
him
forever
,
into
the
bargain
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
TOM
arrived
at
home
in
a
dreary
mood
,
and
the
first
thing
his
aunt
said
*NL*
to
him
showed
him
that
he
had
brought
his
sorrows
to
an
unpromising
*NL*
market
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
I
've
a
notion
to
skin
you
alive
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Auntie
,
what
have
I
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
've
done
enough
.
Here
I
go
over
to
Sereny
Harper
,
like
an
old
*NL*
softy
,
expecting
I
'm
going
to
make
her
believe
all
that
rubbage
about
*NL*
that
dream
,
when
lo
and
behold
you
she
'd
found
out
from
Joe
that
you
was
*NL*
over
here
and
heard
all
the
talk
we
had
that
night
.
Tom
,
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
is
to
become
of
a
boy
that
will
act
like
that
.
It
makes
me
feel
so
*NL*
bad
to
think
you
could
let
me
go
to
Sereny
Harper
and
make
such
a
fool
*NL*
of
myself
and
never
say
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
new
aspect
of
the
thing
.
His
smartness
of
the
morning
had
*NL*
seemed
to
Tom
a
good
joke
before
,
and
very
ingenious
.
It
merely
looked
*NL*
mean
and
shabby
now
.
He
hung
his
head
and
could
not
think
of
anything
to
*NL*
say
for
a
moment
.
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Auntie
,
I
wish
I
had
n't
done
it
--
but
I
did
n't
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
child
,
you
never
think
.
You
never
think
of
anything
but
your
*NL*
own
selfishness
.
You
could
think
to
come
all
the
way
over
here
from
*NL*
Jackson
's
Island
in
the
night
to
laugh
at
our
troubles
,
and
you
could
*NL*
think
to
fool
me
with
a
lie
about
a
dream
;
but
you
could
n't
ever
think
*NL*
to
pity
us
and
save
us
from
sorrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Auntie
,
I
know
now
it
was
mean
,
but
I
did
n't
mean
to
be
mean

I
did

,
*NL*
honest
.
And
besides
,
I
did
n't
come
over
here
to
laugh
at
you
that
*NL*
night

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
come
for
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
to
tell
you
not
to
be
uneasy
about
us
,
because
we
had
n't
got
*NL*
drownded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
Tom
,
I
would
be
the
thankfullest
soul
in
this
world
if
I
could
*NL*
believe
you
ever
had
as
good
a
thought
as
that
,
but
you
know
you
never
*NL*
did
--
and
I
know
it
,
Tom

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

did

*NL*
``

``
It

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I
'd

most
be
glad
you
'd
run
off
and
acted
so
bad

But

*NL*
ai
n't
reasonable

why
did
n't
you
tell
me
,
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
when
you
got
to
talking
about
the
funeral
,
I
just
got
all
*NL*
full
of
the
idea
of
our
coming
and
hiding
in
the
church
,
and
I
could
n't
*NL*
somehow
bear
to
spoil
it
.
So
I
just
put
the
bark
back
in
my
pocket
and
*NL*
kept
mum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
bark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bark
I
had
wrote
on
to
tell
you
we
'd
gone
pirating

I
wish
,
now

*NL*
you
'd
waked
up
when
I
kissed
you
--
I
do

honest

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hard
lines
in
his
aunt
's
face
relaxed
and
a
sudden
tenderness
dawned
*NL*
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Did
_
you
kiss
me
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
I
did

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
you
did

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

yes

I
did

auntie

certain
sure

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
kiss
me
for
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
loved
you
so
,
and
you
laid
there
moaning
and
I
was
so
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
sounded
like
truth
.
The
old
lady
could
not
hide
a
tremor
in
*NL*
her
voice
when
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kiss
me
again
,
Tom
!
--
and
be
off
with
you
to
school
,
now

and
do
n't
*NL*
bother
me
any
more

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
he
was
gone
,
she
ran
to
a
closet
and
got
out
the
ruin
of
a
*NL*
jacket
which
Tom
had
gone
pirating
in
.
Then
she
stopped
,
with
it
in
her
*NL*
hand
,
and
said
to
herself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
dare
.
Poor
boy
,
I
reckon
he
's
lied
about
it
--
but
it
's
a
*NL*
blessed
,
blessed
lie
,
there
's
such
a
comfort
come
from
it
.
I
hope
*NL*
the
Lord
--
I
_
know
_
the
Lord
will
forgive
him
,
because
it
was
such
*NL*
good-heartedness
in
him
to
tell
it
.
But
I
do
n't
want
to
find
out
it
's
a
*NL*
lie
.
I
wo
n't
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
the
jacket
away
,
and
stood
by
musing
a
minute
.
Twice
she
put
out
*NL*
her
hand
to
take
the
garment
again
,
and
twice
she
refrained
.
Once
more
*NL*
she
ventured
,
and
this
time
she
fortified
herself
with
the
thought
:
*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
lie
--
it
's
a
good
lie
--
I
wo
n't
let
it
grieve
me
.
''
So
she
*NL*
sought
the
jacket
pocket
.
A
moment
later
she
was
reading
Tom
's
piece
of
*NL*
bark
through
flowing
tears
and
saying
:
``
I
could
forgive
the
boy
,
now
,
if
*NL*
he
'd
committed
a
million
sins
!

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
THERE
was
something
about
Aunt
Polly
's
manner
,
when
she
kissed
Tom
,
that
*NL*
swept
away
his
low
spirits
and
made
him
lighthearted
and
happy
again
.
He
*NL*
started
to
school
and
had
the
luck
of
coming
upon
Becky
Thatcher
at
the
*NL*
head
of
Meadow
Lane
.
His
mood
always
determined
his
manner
.
Without
a
*NL*
moment
's
hesitation
he
ran
to
her
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
acted
mighty
mean
today
,
Becky
,
and
I
'm
so
sorry
.
I
wo
n't
ever
,
ever
*NL*
do
that
way
again
,
as
long
as
ever
I
live
--
please
make
up
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
stopped
and
looked
him
scornfully
in
the
face
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
thank
you
to
keep
yourself
_
to
_
yourself
,
Mr.
Thomas
Sawyer
.
I
'll
*NL*
never
speak
to
you
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tossed
her
head
and
passed
on
.
Tom
was
so
stunned
that
he
had
not
*NL*
even
presence
of
mind
enough
to
say
``
Who
cares
,
Miss
Smarty
?
''
until
the
*NL*
right
time
to
say
it
had
gone
by
.
So
he
said
nothing
.
But
he
was
in
a
*NL*
fine
rage
,
nevertheless
.
He
moped
into
the
schoolyard
wishing
she
were
*NL*
a
boy
,
and
imagining
how
he
would
trounce
her
if
she
were
.
He
presently
*NL*
encountered
her
and
delivered
a
stinging
remark
as
he
passed
.
She
hurled
*NL*
one
in
return
,
and
the
angry
breach
was
complete
.
It
seemed
to
Becky
,
in
*NL*
her
hot
resentment
,
that
she
could
hardly
wait
for
school
to
``
take
in
,
''
*NL*
she
was
so
impatient
to
see
Tom
flogged
for
the
injured
spelling-book
.
*NL*
If
she
had
had
any
lingering
notion
of
exposing
Alfred
Temple
,
Tom
's
*NL*
offensive
fling
had
driven
it
entirely
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
girl
,
she
did
not
know
how
fast
she
was
nearing
trouble
herself
.
*NL*
The
master
,
Mr.
Dobbins
,
had
reached
middle
age
with
an
unsatisfied
*NL*
ambition
.
The
darling
of
his
desires
was
,
to
be
a
doctor
,
but
*NL*
poverty
had
decreed
that
he
should
be
nothing
higher
than
a
village
*NL*
schoolmaster
.
Every
day
he
took
a
mysterious
book
out
of
his
desk
and
*NL*
absorbed
himself
in
it
at
times
when
no
classes
were
reciting
.
He
kept
*NL*
that
book
under
lock
and
key
.
There
was
not
an
urchin
in
school
but
was
*NL*
perishing
to
have
a
glimpse
of
it
,
but
the
chance
never
came
.
Every
boy
*NL*
and
girl
had
a
theory
about
the
nature
of
that
book
;
but
no
two
theories
*NL*
were
alike
,
and
there
was
no
way
of
getting
at
the
facts
in
the
case
.
*NL*
Now
,
as
Becky
was
passing
by
the
desk
,
which
stood
near
the
door
,
she
*NL*
noticed
that
the
key
was
in
the
lock
!
It
was
a
precious
moment
.
She
*NL*
glanced
around
;
found
herself
alone
,
and
the
next
instant
she
had
the
*NL*
book
in
her
hands
.
The
titlepage
--
Professor
Somebody
's
_
Anatomy
_
--
carried
*NL*
no
information
to
her
mind
;
so
she
began
to
turn
the
leaves
.
She
came
at
*NL*
once
upon
a
handsomely
engraved
and
colored
frontispiece
--
a
human
figure
,
*NL*
stark
naked
.
At
that
moment
a
shadow
fell
on
the
page
and
Tom
Sawyer
*NL*
stepped
in
at
the
door
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
picture
.
Becky
*NL*
snatched
at
the
book
to
close
it
,
and
had
the
hard
luck
to
tear
the
*NL*
pictured
page
half
down
the
middle
.
She
thrust
the
volume
into
the
desk
,
*NL*
turned
the
key
,
and
burst
out
crying
with
shame
and
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
Sawyer
,
you
are
just
as
mean
as
you
can
be
,
to
sneak
up
on
a
person
*NL*
and
look
at
what
they
're
looking
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
know
you
was
looking
at
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
,
Tom
Sawyer
;
you
know
you
're
*NL*
going
to
tell
on
me
,
and
oh
,
what
shall
I
do
,
what
shall
I
do
!
I
'll
be
*NL*
whipped
,
and
I
never
was
whipped
in
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
stamped
her
little
foot
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Be
_
so
mean
if
you
want
to
!
I
know
something
that
's
going
to
happen
.
*NL*
You
just
wait
and
you
'll
see
!
Hateful
,
hateful
,
hateful
!
''
--
and
she
flung
*NL*
out
of
the
house
with
a
new
explosion
of
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
stood
still
,
rather
flustered
by
this
onslaught
.
Presently
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
curious
kind
of
a
fool
a
girl
is
!
Never
been
licked
in
*NL*
school
!
Shucks
!
What
's
a
licking
!
That
's
just
like
a
girl
--
they
're
so
*NL*
thin-skinned
and
chicken-hearted
.
Well
,
of
course
I
ai
n't
going
to
tell
*NL*
old
Dobbins
on
this
little
fool
,
because
there
's
other
ways
of
getting
*NL*
even
on
her
,
that
ai
n't
so
mean
;
but
what
of
it
?
Old
Dobbins
will
ask
*NL*
who
it
was
tore
his
book
.
Nobody
'll
answer
.
Then
he
'll
do
just
the
way
*NL*
he
always
does
--
ask
first
one
and
then
t
`
other
,
and
when
he
comes
to
the
*NL*
right
girl
he
'll
know
it
,
without
any
telling
.
Girls
'
faces
always
tell
*NL*
on
them
.
They
ai
n't
got
any
backbone
.
She
'll
get
licked
.
Well
,
it
's
a
*NL*
kind
of
a
tight
place
for
Becky
Thatcher
,
because
there
ai
n't
any
way
*NL*
out
of
it
.
''
Tom
conned
the
thing
a
moment
longer
,
and
then
added
:
``
All
*NL*
right
,
though
;
she
'd
like
to
see
me
in
just
such
a
fix
--
let
her
sweat
it
*NL*
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
joined
the
mob
of
skylarking
scholars
outside
.
In
a
few
moments
the
*NL*
master
arrived
and
school
``
took
in
.
''
Tom
did
not
feel
a
strong
interest
*NL*
in
his
studies
.
Every
time
he
stole
a
glance
at
the
girls
'
side
of
the
*NL*
room
Becky
's
face
troubled
him
.
Considering
all
things
,
he
did
not
want
*NL*
to
pity
her
,
and
yet
it
was
all
he
could
do
to
help
it
.
He
could
get
*NL*
up
no
exultation
that
was
really
worthy
the
name
.
Presently
the
*NL*
spelling-book
discovery
was
made
,
and
Tom
's
mind
was
entirely
full
*NL*
of
his
own
matters
for
a
while
after
that
.
Becky
roused
up
from
her
*NL*
lethargy
of
distress
and
showed
good
interest
in
the
proceedings
.
She
*NL*
did
not
expect
that
Tom
could
get
out
of
his
trouble
by
denying
that
he
*NL*
spilt
the
ink
on
the
book
himself
;
and
she
was
right
.
The
denial
only
*NL*
seemed
to
make
the
thing
worse
for
Tom
.
Becky
supposed
she
would
be
glad
*NL*
of
that
,
and
she
tried
to
believe
she
was
glad
of
it
,
but
she
found
she
*NL*
was
not
certain
.
When
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
,
she
had
an
impulse
*NL*
to
get
up
and
tell
on
Alfred
Temple
,
but
she
made
an
effort
and
forced
*NL*
herself
to
keep
still
--
because
,
said
she
to
herself
,
``
he
'll
tell
about
me
*NL*
tearing
the
picture
sure
.
I
would
n't
say
a
word
,
not
to
save
his
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
took
his
whipping
and
went
back
to
his
seat
not
at
all
*NL*
broken-hearted
,
for
he
thought
it
was
possible
that
he
had
unknowingly
*NL*
upset
the
ink
on
the
spelling-book
himself
,
in
some
skylarking
bout
--
he
*NL*
had
denied
it
for
form
's
sake
and
because
it
was
custom
,
and
had
stuck
*NL*
to
the
denial
from
principle
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
whole
hour
drifted
by
,
the
master
sat
nodding
in
his
throne
,
the
air
*NL*
was
drowsy
with
the
hum
of
study
.
By
and
by
,
Mr.
Dobbins
straightened
*NL*
himself
up
,
yawned
,
then
unlocked
his
desk
,
and
reached
for
his
book
,
*NL*
but
seemed
undecided
whether
to
take
it
out
or
leave
it
.
Most
of
the
*NL*
pupils
glanced
up
languidly
,
but
there
were
two
among
them
that
watched
*NL*
his
movements
with
intent
eyes
.
Mr.
Dobbins
fingered
his
book
absently
*NL*
for
a
while
,
then
took
it
out
and
settled
himself
in
his
chair
to
read
!
*NL*
Tom
shot
a
glance
at
Becky
.
He
had
seen
a
hunted
and
helpless
rabbit
*NL*
look
as
she
did
,
with
a
gun
levelled
at
its
head
.
Instantly
he
forgot
*NL*
his
quarrel
with
her
.
Quick
--
something
must
be
done
!
done
in
a
flash
,
*NL*
too
!
But
the
very
imminence
of
the
emergency
paralyzed
his
invention
.
*NL*
Good
!
--
he
had
an
inspiration
!
He
would
run
and
snatch
the
book
,
spring
*NL*
through
the
door
and
fly
.
But
his
resolution
shook
for
one
little
*NL*
instant
,
and
the
chance
was
lost
--
the
master
opened
the
volume
.
If
Tom
*NL*
only
had
the
wasted
opportunity
back
again
!
Too
late
.
There
was
no
help
*NL*
for
Becky
now
,
he
said
.
The
next
moment
the
master
faced
the
school
.
*NL*
Every
eye
sank
under
his
gaze
.
There
was
that
in
it
which
smote
even
*NL*
the
innocent
with
fear
.
There
was
silence
while
one
might
count
ten
--
the
*NL*
master
was
gathering
his
wrath
.
Then
he
spoke
:
``
Who
tore
this
book
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
not
a
sound
.
One
could
have
heard
a
pin
drop
.
The
stillness
*NL*
continued
;
the
master
searched
face
after
face
for
signs
of
guilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Benjamin
Rogers
,
did
you
tear
this
book
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
denial
.
Another
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joseph
Harper
,
did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
denial
.
Tom
's
uneasiness
grew
more
and
more
intense
under
the
*NL*
slow
torture
of
these
proceedings
.
The
master
scanned
the
ranks
of
*NL*
boys
--
considered
a
while
,
then
turned
to
the
girls
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amy
Lawrence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
shake
of
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracie
Miller
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Susan
Harper
,
did
you
do
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
negative
.
The
next
girl
was
Becky
Thatcher
.
Tom
was
trembling
*NL*
from
head
to
foot
with
excitement
and
a
sense
of
the
hopelessness
of
the
*NL*
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rebecca
Thatcher
''
-LSB-
Tom
glanced
at
her
face
--
it
was
white
with
*NL*
terror
-RSB-
--
``
did
you
tear
--
no
,
look
me
in
the
face
''
-LSB-
her
hands
rose
in
*NL*
appeal
-RSB-
--
``
did
you
tear
this
book
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
thought
shot
like
lightning
through
Tom
's
brain
.
He
sprang
to
his
feet
*NL*
and
shouted
--
``
I
done
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
school
stared
in
perplexity
at
this
incredible
folly
.
Tom
stood
a
*NL*
moment
,
to
gather
his
dismembered
faculties
;
and
when
he
stepped
forward
*NL*
to
go
to
his
punishment
the
surprise
,
the
gratitude
,
the
adoration
that
*NL*
shone
upon
him
out
of
poor
Becky
's
eyes
seemed
pay
enough
for
a
hundred
*NL*
floggings
.
Inspired
by
the
splendor
of
his
own
act
,
he
took
without
*NL*
an
outcry
the
most
merciless
flaying
that
even
Mr.
Dobbins
had
ever
*NL*
administered
;
and
also
received
with
indifference
the
added
cruelty
of
a
*NL*
command
to
remain
two
hours
after
school
should
be
dismissed
--
for
he
*NL*
knew
who
would
wait
for
him
outside
till
his
captivity
was
done
,
and
not
*NL*
count
the
tedious
time
as
loss
,
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
went
to
bed
that
night
planning
vengeance
against
Alfred
Temple
;
for
*NL*
with
shame
and
repentance
Becky
had
told
him
all
,
not
forgetting
her
own
*NL*
treachery
;
but
even
the
longing
for
vengeance
had
to
give
way
,
soon
,
to
*NL*
pleasanter
musings
,
and
he
fell
asleep
at
last
with
Becky
's
latest
words
*NL*
lingering
dreamily
in
his
ear
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
how
_
could
_
you
be
so
noble
!

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
VACATION
was
approaching
.
The
schoolmaster
,
always
severe
,
grew
severer
*NL*
and
more
exacting
than
ever
,
for
he
wanted
the
school
to
make
a
good
*NL*
showing
on
``
Examination
''
day
.
His
rod
and
his
ferule
were
seldom
idle
*NL*
now
--
at
least
among
the
smaller
pupils
.
Only
the
biggest
boys
,
and
young
*NL*
ladies
of
eighteen
and
twenty
,
escaped
lashing
.
Mr.
Dobbins
'
lashings
*NL*
were
very
vigorous
ones
,
too
;
for
although
he
carried
,
under
his
wig
,
a
*NL*
perfectly
bald
and
shiny
head
,
he
had
only
reached
middle
age
,
and
there
*NL*
was
no
sign
of
feebleness
in
his
muscle
.
As
the
great
day
approached
,
*NL*
all
the
tyranny
that
was
in
him
came
to
the
surface
;
he
seemed
to
take
a
*NL*
vindictive
pleasure
in
punishing
the
least
shortcomings
.
The
consequence
*NL*
was
,
that
the
smaller
boys
spent
their
days
in
terror
and
suffering
and
*NL*
their
nights
in
plotting
revenge
.
They
threw
away
no
opportunity
to
do
*NL*
the
master
a
mischief
.
But
he
kept
ahead
all
the
time
.
The
retribution
*NL*
that
followed
every
vengeful
success
was
so
sweeping
and
majestic
that
*NL*
the
boys
always
retired
from
the
field
badly
worsted
.
At
last
they
*NL*
conspired
together
and
hit
upon
a
plan
that
promised
a
dazzling
victory
.
*NL*
They
swore
in
the
signpainter
's
boy
,
told
him
the
scheme
,
and
asked
his
*NL*
help
.
He
had
his
own
reasons
for
being
delighted
,
for
the
master
boarded
*NL*
in
his
father
's
family
and
had
given
the
boy
ample
cause
to
hate
him
.
*NL*
The
master
's
wife
would
go
on
a
visit
to
the
country
in
a
few
days
,
and
*NL*
there
would
be
nothing
to
interfere
with
the
plan
;
the
master
always
*NL*
prepared
himself
for
great
occasions
by
getting
pretty
well
fuddled
,
and
*NL*
the
signpainter
's
boy
said
that
when
the
dominie
had
reached
the
proper
*NL*
condition
on
Examination
Evening
he
would
``
manage
the
thing
''
while
he
*NL*
napped
in
his
chair
;
then
he
would
have
him
awakened
at
the
right
time
*NL*
and
hurried
away
to
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fulness
of
time
the
interesting
occasion
arrived
.
At
eight
in
*NL*
the
evening
the
schoolhouse
was
brilliantly
lighted
,
and
adorned
with
*NL*
wreaths
and
festoons
of
foliage
and
flowers
.
The
master
sat
throned
in
*NL*
his
great
chair
upon
a
raised
platform
,
with
his
blackboard
behind
him
.
*NL*
He
was
looking
tolerably
mellow
.
Three
rows
of
benches
on
each
side
and
*NL*
six
rows
in
front
of
him
were
occupied
by
the
dignitaries
of
the
town
*NL*
and
by
the
parents
of
the
pupils
.
To
his
left
,
back
of
the
rows
of
*NL*
citizens
,
was
a
spacious
temporary
platform
upon
which
were
seated
the
*NL*
scholars
who
were
to
take
part
in
the
exercises
of
the
evening
;
rows
of
*NL*
small
boys
,
washed
and
dressed
to
an
intolerable
state
of
discomfort
;
*NL*
rows
of
gawky
big
boys
;
snowbanks
of
girls
and
young
ladies
clad
in
*NL*
lawn
and
muslin
and
conspicuously
conscious
of
their
bare
arms
,
their
*NL*
grandmothers
'
ancient
trinkets
,
their
bits
of
pink
and
blue
ribbon
and
*NL*
the
flowers
in
their
hair
.
All
the
rest
of
the
house
was
filled
with
*NL*
non-participating
scholars
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
exercises
began
.
A
very
little
boy
stood
up
and
sheepishly
recited
,
*NL*
``
You
'd
scarce
expect
one
of
my
age
to
speak
in
public
on
the
stage
,
''
*NL*
etc.
--
accompanying
himself
with
the
painfully
exact
and
spasmodic
*NL*
gestures
which
a
machine
might
have
used
--
supposing
the
machine
to
be
a
*NL*
trifle
out
of
order
.
But
he
got
through
safely
,
though
cruelly
scared
,
*NL*
and
got
a
fine
round
of
applause
when
he
made
his
manufactured
bow
and
*NL*
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
shamefaced
girl
lisped
,
``
Mary
had
a
little
lamb
,
''
etc.
,
*NL*
performed
a
compassion-inspiring
curtsy
,
got
her
meed
of
applause
,
and
*NL*
sat
down
flushed
and
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Sawyer
stepped
forward
with
conceited
confidence
and
soared
into
*NL*
the
unquenchable
and
indestructible
``
Give
me
liberty
or
give
me
death
''
*NL*
speech
,
with
fine
fury
and
frantic
gesticulation
,
and
broke
down
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
it
.
A
ghastly
stage-fright
seized
him
,
his
legs
quaked
under
*NL*
him
and
he
was
like
to
choke
.
True
,
he
had
the
manifest
sympathy
of
the
*NL*
house
but
he
had
the
house
's
silence
,
too
,
which
was
even
worse
than
*NL*
its
sympathy
.
The
master
frowned
,
and
this
completed
the
disaster
.
Tom
*NL*
struggled
awhile
and
then
retired
,
utterly
defeated
.
There
was
a
weak
*NL*
attempt
at
applause
,
but
it
died
early
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Boy
Stood
on
the
Burning
Deck
''
followed
;
also
``
The
Assyrian
Came
*NL*
Down
,
''
and
other
declamatory
gems
.
Then
there
were
reading
exercises
,
*NL*
and
a
spelling
fight
.
The
meagre
Latin
class
recited
with
honor
.
The
*NL*
prime
feature
of
the
evening
was
in
order
,
now
--
original
``
compositions
''
*NL*
by
the
young
ladies
.
Each
in
her
turn
stepped
forward
to
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
platform
,
cleared
her
throat
,
held
up
her
manuscript
-LRB-
tied
with
dainty
*NL*
ribbon
-RRB-
,
and
proceeded
to
read
,
with
labored
attention
to
``
expression
''
*NL*
and
punctuation
.
The
themes
were
the
same
that
had
been
illuminated
upon
*NL*
similar
occasions
by
their
mothers
before
them
,
their
grandmothers
,
*NL*
and
doubtless
all
their
ancestors
in
the
female
line
clear
back
to
the
*NL*
Crusades
.
``
Friendship
''
was
one
;
``
Memories
of
Other
Days
''
;
``
Religion
in
*NL*
History
''
;
``
Dream
Land
''
;
``
The
Advantages
of
Culture
''
;
``
Forms
of
Political
*NL*
Government
Compared
and
Contrasted
''
;
``
Melancholy
''
;
``
Filial
Love
''
;
``
Heart
*NL*
Longings
,
''
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
prevalent
feature
in
these
compositions
was
a
nursed
and
petted
*NL*
melancholy
;
another
was
a
wasteful
and
opulent
gush
of
``
fine
language
''
;
*NL*
another
was
a
tendency
to
lug
in
by
the
ears
particularly
prized
words
*NL*
and
phrases
until
they
were
worn
entirely
out
;
and
a
peculiarity
that
*NL*
conspicuously
marked
and
marred
them
was
the
inveterate
and
intolerable
*NL*
sermon
that
wagged
its
crippled
tail
at
the
end
of
each
and
every
one
*NL*
of
them
.
No
matter
what
the
subject
might
be
,
a
brainracking
effort
was
*NL*
made
to
squirm
it
into
some
aspect
or
other
that
the
moral
and
religious
*NL*
mind
could
contemplate
with
edification
.
The
glaring
insincerity
of
*NL*
these
sermons
was
not
sufficient
to
compass
the
banishment
of
the
*NL*
fashion
from
the
schools
,
and
it
is
not
sufficient
today
;
it
never
will
*NL*
be
sufficient
while
the
world
stands
,
perhaps
.
There
is
no
school
in
*NL*
all
our
land
where
the
young
ladies
do
not
feel
obliged
to
close
their
*NL*
compositions
with
a
sermon
;
and
you
will
find
that
the
sermon
of
the
*NL*
most
frivolous
and
the
least
religious
girl
in
the
school
is
always
*NL*
the
longest
and
the
most
relentlessly
pious
.
But
enough
of
this
.
Homely
*NL*
truth
is
unpalatable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
return
to
the
``
Examination
.
''
The
first
composition
that
was
read
*NL*
was
one
entitled
``
Is
this
,
then
,
Life
?
''
Perhaps
the
reader
can
endure
an
*NL*
extract
from
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
common
walks
of
life
,
with
what
delightful
emotions
does
the
*NL*
youthful
mind
look
forward
to
some
anticipated
scene
of
festivity
!
*NL*
Imagination
is
busy
sketching
rose-tinted
pictures
of
joy
.
In
fancy
,
the
*NL*
voluptuous
votary
of
fashion
sees
herself
amid
the
festive
throng
,
`
the
*NL*
observed
of
all
observers
.
'
Her
graceful
form
,
arrayed
in
snowy
robes
,
*NL*
is
whirling
through
the
mazes
of
the
joyous
dance
;
her
eye
is
brightest
,
*NL*
her
step
is
lightest
in
the
gay
assembly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
such
delicious
fancies
time
quickly
glides
by
,
and
the
welcome
hour
*NL*
arrives
for
her
entrance
into
the
Elysian
world
,
of
which
she
has
*NL*
had
such
bright
dreams
.
How
fairy-like
does
everything
appear
to
her
*NL*
enchanted
vision
!
Each
new
scene
is
more
charming
than
the
last
.
But
*NL*
after
a
while
she
finds
that
beneath
this
goodly
exterior
,
all
is
*NL*
vanity
,
the
flattery
which
once
charmed
her
soul
,
now
grates
harshly
*NL*
upon
her
ear
;
the
ballroom
has
lost
its
charms
;
and
with
wasted
health
*NL*
and
imbittered
heart
,
she
turns
away
with
the
conviction
that
earthly
*NL*
pleasures
can
not
satisfy
the
longings
of
the
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
forth
and
so
on
.
There
was
a
buzz
of
gratification
from
time
to
*NL*
time
during
the
reading
,
accompanied
by
whispered
ejaculations
of
``
How
*NL*
sweet
!
''
``
How
eloquent
!
''
``
So
true
!
''
etc.
,
and
after
the
thing
had
closed
*NL*
with
a
peculiarly
afflicting
sermon
the
applause
was
enthusiastic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
arose
a
slim
,
melancholy
girl
,
whose
face
had
the
``
interesting
''
*NL*
paleness
that
comes
of
pills
and
indigestion
,
and
read
a
``
poem
.
''
Two
*NL*
stanzas
of
it
will
do
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
MISSOURI
MAIDEN
'S
FAREWELL
TO
ALABAMA
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alabama
,
goodbye
!
I
love
thee
well
!
But
yet
for
a
while
do
I
leave
thee
*NL*
now
!
Sad
,
yes
,
sad
thoughts
of
thee
my
heart
doth
swell
,
And
burning
*NL*
recollections
throng
my
brow
!
For
I
have
wandered
through
thy
flowery
*NL*
woods
;
Have
roamed
and
read
near
Tallapoosa
's
stream
;
Have
listened
to
*NL*
Tallassee
's
warring
floods
,
And
wooed
on
Coosa
's
side
Aurora
's
beam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
shame
I
not
to
bear
an
o'erfull
heart
,
Nor
blush
to
turn
behind
*NL*
my
tearful
eyes
;
'T
is
from
no
stranger
land
I
now
must
part
,
'T
is
to
no
*NL*
strangers
left
I
yield
these
sighs
.
Welcome
and
home
were
mine
within
*NL*
this
State
,
Whose
vales
I
leave
--
whose
spires
fade
fast
from
me
And
cold
*NL*
must
be
mine
eyes
,
and
heart
,
and
tete
,
When
,
dear
Alabama
!
they
turn
*NL*
cold
on
thee
!
''
There
were
very
few
there
who
knew
what
``
tete
''
meant
,
but
*NL*
the
poem
was
very
satisfactory
,
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
appeared
a
dark-complexioned
,
black-eyed
,
black-haired
young
lady
,
*NL*
who
paused
an
impressive
moment
,
assumed
a
tragic
expression
,
and
began
*NL*
to
read
in
a
measured
,
solemn
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
VISION
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dark
and
tempestuous
was
night
.
Around
the
throne
on
high
not
a
single
*NL*
star
quivered
;
but
the
deep
intonations
of
the
heavy
thunder
constantly
*NL*
vibrated
upon
the
ear
;
whilst
the
terrific
lightning
revelled
in
angry
*NL*
mood
through
the
cloudy
chambers
of
heaven
,
seeming
to
scorn
the
power
*NL*
exerted
over
its
terror
by
the
illustrious
Franklin
!
Even
the
boisterous
*NL*
winds
unanimously
came
forth
from
their
mystic
homes
,
and
blustered
*NL*
about
as
if
to
enhance
by
their
aid
the
wildness
of
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
such
a
time
,
so
dark
,
so
dreary
,
for
human
sympathy
my
very
spirit
*NL*
sighed
;
but
instead
thereof
,
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
My
dearest
friend
,
my
counsellor
,
my
comforter
and
guide
--
My
joy
in
*NL*
grief
,
my
second
bliss
in
joy
,
'
came
to
my
side
.
She
moved
like
one
of
*NL*
those
bright
beings
pictured
in
the
sunny
walks
of
fancy
's
Eden
by
*NL*
the
romantic
and
young
,
a
queen
of
beauty
unadorned
save
by
her
own
*NL*
transcendent
loveliness
.
So
soft
was
her
step
,
it
failed
to
make
even
a
*NL*
sound
,
and
but
for
the
magical
thrill
imparted
by
her
genial
touch
,
*NL*
as
other
unobtrusive
beauties
,
she
would
have
glided
away
*NL*
unperceived
--
unsought
.
A
strange
sadness
rested
upon
her
features
,
like
*NL*
icy
tears
upon
the
robe
of
December
,
as
she
pointed
to
the
contending
*NL*
elements
without
,
and
bade
me
contemplate
the
two
beings
presented
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
nightmare
occupied
some
ten
pages
of
manuscript
and
wound
up
with
a
*NL*
sermon
so
destructive
of
all
hope
to
non-Presbyterians
that
it
took
*NL*
the
first
prize
.
This
composition
was
considered
to
be
the
very
finest
*NL*
effort
of
the
evening
.
The
mayor
of
the
village
,
in
delivering
the
prize
*NL*
to
the
author
of
it
,
made
a
warm
speech
in
which
he
said
that
it
was
by
*NL*
far
the
most
``
eloquent
''
thing
he
had
ever
listened
to
,
and
that
Daniel
*NL*
Webster
himself
might
well
be
proud
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
remarked
,
in
passing
,
that
the
number
of
compositions
in
which
*NL*
the
word
``
beauteous
''
was
over-fondled
,
and
human
experience
referred
to
*NL*
as
``
life
's
page
,
''
was
up
to
the
usual
average
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
master
,
mellow
almost
to
the
verge
of
geniality
,
put
his
chair
*NL*
aside
,
turned
his
back
to
the
audience
,
and
began
to
draw
a
map
of
*NL*
America
on
the
blackboard
,
to
exercise
the
geography
class
upon
.
But
he
*NL*
made
a
sad
business
of
it
with
his
unsteady
hand
,
and
a
smothered
titter
*NL*
rippled
over
the
house
.
He
knew
what
the
matter
was
,
and
set
himself
to
*NL*
right
it
.
He
sponged
out
lines
and
remade
them
;
but
he
only
distorted
*NL*
them
more
than
ever
,
and
the
tittering
was
more
pronounced
.
He
threw
his
*NL*
entire
attention
upon
his
work
,
now
,
as
if
determined
not
to
be
put
down
*NL*
by
the
mirth
.
He
felt
that
all
eyes
were
fastened
upon
him
;
he
imagined
*NL*
he
was
succeeding
,
and
yet
the
tittering
continued
;
it
even
manifestly
*NL*
increased
.
And
well
it
might
.
There
was
a
garret
above
,
pierced
with
*NL*
a
scuttle
over
his
head
;
and
down
through
this
scuttle
came
a
cat
,
*NL*
suspended
around
the
haunches
by
a
string
;
she
had
a
rag
tied
about
*NL*
her
head
and
jaws
to
keep
her
from
mewing
;
as
she
slowly
descended
she
*NL*
curved
upward
and
clawed
at
the
string
,
she
swung
downward
and
clawed
*NL*
at
the
intangible
air
.
The
tittering
rose
higher
and
higher
--
the
cat
was
*NL*
within
six
inches
of
the
absorbed
teacher
's
head
--
down
,
down
,
a
little
*NL*
lower
,
and
she
grabbed
his
wig
with
her
desperate
claws
,
clung
to
it
,
*NL*
and
was
snatched
up
into
the
garret
in
an
instant
with
her
trophy
still
*NL*
in
her
possession
!
And
how
the
light
did
blaze
abroad
from
the
master
's
*NL*
bald
pate
--
for
the
signpainter
's
boy
had
_
gilded
_
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
That
broke
up
the
meeting
.
The
boys
were
avenged
.
Vacation
had
come
.

The

--
but
they
are
exactly
and
precisely
after
the
schoolgirl

are
much

any

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
TOM
joined
the
new
order
of
Cadets
of
Temperance
,
being
attracted
by
the
*NL*
showy
character
of
their
``
regalia
.
''
He
promised
to
abstain
from
smoking
,
*NL*
chewing
,
and
profanity
as
long
as
he
remained
a
member
.
Now
he
found
out
*NL*
a
new
thing
--
namely
,
that
to
promise
not
to
do
a
thing
is
the
surest
way
*NL*
in
the
world
to
make
a
body
want
to
go
and
do
that
very
thing
.
Tom
soon
*NL*
found
himself
tormented
with
a
desire
to
drink
and
swear
;
the
desire
*NL*
grew
to
be
so
intense
that
nothing
but
the
hope
of
a
chance
to
display
*NL*
himself
in
his
red
sash
kept
him
from
withdrawing
from
the
order
.
Fourth
*NL*
of
July
was
coming
;
but
he
soon
gave
that
up
--
gave
it
up
before
he
had
*NL*
worn
his
shackles
over
forty-eight
hours
--
and
fixed
his
hopes
upon
old
*NL*
Judge
Frazer
,
justice
of
the
peace
,
who
was
apparently
on
his
deathbed
*NL*
and
would
have
a
big
public
funeral
,
since
he
was
so
high
an
official
.
*NL*
During
three
days
Tom
was
deeply
concerned
about
the
Judge
's
condition
*NL*
and
hungry
for
news
of
it
.
Sometimes
his
hopes
ran
high
--
so
high
that
*NL*
he
would
venture
to
get
out
his
regalia
and
practise
before
the
*NL*
looking-glass
.
But
the
Judge
had
a
most
discouraging
way
of
fluctuating
.
*NL*
At
last
he
was
pronounced
upon
the
mend
--
and
then
convalescent
.
Tom
was
*NL*
disgusted
;
and
felt
a
sense
of
injury
,
too
.
He
handed
in
his
resignation
*NL*
at
once
--
and
that
night
the
Judge
suffered
a
relapse
and
died
.
Tom
*NL*
resolved
that
he
would
never
trust
a
man
like
that
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
funeral
was
a
fine
thing
.
The
Cadets
paraded
in
a
style
calculated
*NL*
to
kill
the
late
member
with
envy
.
Tom
was
a
free
boy
again
,
*NL*
however
--
there
was
something
in
that
.
He
could
drink
and
swear
,
now
--
but
*NL*
found
to
his
surprise
that
he
did
not
want
to
.
The
simple
fact
that
he
*NL*
could
,
took
the
desire
away
,
and
the
charm
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
presently
wondered
to
find
that
his
coveted
vacation
was
beginning
*NL*
to
hang
a
little
heavily
on
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
attempted
a
diary
--
but
nothing
happened
during
three
days
,
and
so
he
*NL*
abandoned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
of
all
the
negro
minstrel
shows
came
to
town
,
and
made
a
*NL*
sensation
.
Tom
and
Joe
Harper
got
up
a
band
of
performers
and
were
happy
*NL*
for
two
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
Glorious
Fourth
was
in
some
sense
a
failure
,
for
it
rained
*NL*
hard
,
there
was
no
procession
in
consequence
,
and
the
greatest
man
*NL*
in
the
world
-LRB-
as
Tom
supposed
-RRB-
,
Mr.
Benton
,
an
actual
United
States
*NL*
Senator
,
proved
an
overwhelming
disappointment
--
for
he
was
not
*NL*
twenty-five
feet
high
,
nor
even
anywhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
circus
came
.
The
boys
played
circus
for
three
days
afterward
in
tents
*NL*
made
of
rag
carpeting
--
admission
,
three
pins
for
boys
,
two
for
girls
--
and
*NL*
then
circusing
was
abandoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
phrenologist
and
a
mesmerizer
came
--
and
went
again
and
left
the
village
*NL*
duller
and
drearier
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
boys-and-girls
'
parties
,
but
they
were
so
few
and
so
*NL*
delightful
that
they
only
made
the
aching
voids
between
ache
the
harder
.

Becky
Thatcher
was
gone
to
her
Constantinople
home
to
stay
with
her
*NL*
parents
during
vacation
--
so
there
was
no
bright
side
to
life
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dreadful
secret
of
the
murder
was
a
chronic
misery
.
It
was
a
very
*NL*
cancer
for
permanency
and
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
measles
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
two
long
weeks
Tom
lay
a
prisoner
,
dead
to
the
world
and
its
*NL*
happenings
.
He
was
very
ill
,
he
was
interested
in
nothing
.
When
he
got
*NL*
upon
his
feet
at
last
and
moved
feebly
downtown
,
a
melancholy
change
had
*NL*
come
over
everything
and
every
creature
.
There
had
been
a
``
revival
,
''
and
*NL*
everybody
had
``
got
religion
,
''
not
only
the
adults
,
but
even
the
boys
and
*NL*
girls
.
Tom
went
about
,
hoping
against
hope
for
the
sight
of
one
blessed
*NL*
sinful
face
,
but
disappointment
crossed
him
everywhere
.
He
found
Joe
*NL*
Harper
studying
a
Testament
,
and
turned
sadly
away
from
the
depressing
*NL*
spectacle
.
He
sought
Ben
Rogers
,
and
found
him
visiting
the
poor
with
a
*NL*
basket
of
tracts
.
He
hunted
up
Jim
Hollis
,
who
called
his
attention
to
*NL*
the
precious
blessing
of
his
late
measles
as
a
warning
.
Every
boy
*NL*
he
encountered
added
another
ton
to
his
depression
;
and
when
,
in
*NL*
desperation
,
he
flew
for
refuge
at
last
to
the
bosom
of
Huckleberry
Finn
*NL*
and
was
received
with
a
Scriptural
quotation
,
his
heart
broke
and
he
*NL*
crept
home
and
to
bed
realizing
that
he
alone
of
all
the
town
was
lost
,
*NL*
forever
and
forever
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
that
night
there
came
on
a
terrific
storm
,
with
driving
rain
,
awful
*NL*
claps
of
thunder
and
blinding
sheets
of
lightning
.
He
covered
his
head
*NL*
with
the
bedclothes
and
waited
in
a
horror
of
suspense
for
his
doom
;
for
*NL*
he
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
all
this
hubbub
was
about
him
.
*NL*
He
believed
he
had
taxed
the
forbearance
of
the
powers
above
to
the
*NL*
extremity
of
endurance
and
that
this
was
the
result
.
It
might
have
*NL*
seemed
to
him
a
waste
of
pomp
and
ammunition
to
kill
a
bug
with
a
*NL*
battery
of
artillery
,
but
there
seemed
nothing
incongruous
about
the
*NL*
getting
up
such
an
expensive
thunderstorm
as
this
to
knock
the
turf
from
*NL*
under
an
insect
like
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
the
tempest
spent
itself
and
died
without
accomplishing
its
*NL*
object
.
The
boy
's
first
impulse
was
to
be
grateful
,
and
reform
.
His
*NL*
second
was
to
wait
--
for
there
might
not
be
any
more
storms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
the
doctors
were
back
;
Tom
had
relapsed
.
The
three
weeks
he
*NL*
spent
on
his
back
this
time
seemed
an
entire
age
.
When
he
got
abroad
*NL*
at
last
he
was
hardly
grateful
that
he
had
been
spared
,
remembering
how
*NL*
lonely
was
his
estate
,
how
companionless
and
forlorn
he
was
.
He
drifted
*NL*
listlessly
down
the
street
and
found
Jim
Hollis
acting
as
judge
in
a
*NL*
juvenile
court
that
was
trying
a
cat
for
murder
,
in
the
presence
of
her
*NL*
victim
,
a
bird
.
He
found
Joe
Harper
and
Huck
Finn
up
an
alley
eating
a
*NL*
stolen
melon
.
Poor
lads
!
they
--
like
Tom
--
had
suffered
a
relapse
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
AT
last
the
sleepy
atmosphere
was
stirred
--
and
vigorously
:
the
murder
*NL*
trial
came
on
in
the
court
.
It
became
the
absorbing
topic
of
village
*NL*
talk
immediately
.
Tom
could
not
get
away
from
it
.
Every
reference
to
*NL*
the
murder
sent
a
shudder
to
his
heart
,
for
his
troubled
conscience
*NL*
and
fears
almost
persuaded
him
that
these
remarks
were
put
forth
in
*NL*
his
hearing
as
``
feelers
''
;
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
be
suspected
of
*NL*
knowing
anything
about
the
murder
,
but
still
he
could
not
be
comfortable
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
this
gossip
.
It
kept
him
in
a
cold
shiver
all
the
time
.
*NL*
He
took
Huck
to
a
lonely
place
to
have
a
talk
with
him
.
It
would
be
some
*NL*
relief
to
unseal
his
tongue
for
a
little
while
;
to
divide
his
burden
of
*NL*
distress
with
another
sufferer
.
Moreover
,
he
wanted
to
assure
himself
*NL*
that
Huck
had
remained
discreet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
,
have
you
ever
told
anybody
about
--
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Bout
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
`
course
I
have
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
a
word
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
a
solitary
word
,
so
help
me
.
What
makes
you
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
afeard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Tom
Sawyer
,
we
would
n't
be
alive
two
days
if
that
got
found
out
.
*NL*
_
You
_
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
felt
more
comfortable
.
After
a
pause
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
,
they
could
n't
anybody
get
you
to
tell
,
could
they
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
me
to
tell
?
Why
,
if
I
wanted
that
halfbreed
devil
to
drownd
me
they
*NL*
could
get
me
to
tell
.
They
ai
n't
no
different
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
all
right
,
then
.
I
reckon
we
're
safe
as
long
as
we
keep
*NL*
mum
.
But
let
's
swear
again
,
anyway
.
It
's
more
surer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
agreed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
swore
again
with
dread
solemnities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
talk
around
,
Huck
?
I
've
heard
a
power
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
?
Well
,
it
's
just
Muff
Potter
,
Muff
Potter
,
Muff
Potter
all
the
*NL*
time
.
It
keeps
me
in
a
sweat
,
constant
,
so
's
I
want
to
hide
som
`
ers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
the
same
way
they
go
on
round
me
.
I
reckon
he
's
a
goner

*NL*
Do
n't
you
feel
sorry
for
him
,
sometimes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
always
--
most
always
.
He
ai
n't
no
account
;
but
then
he
hai
n't
ever
*NL*
done
anything
to
hurt
anybody
.
Just
fishes
a
little
,
to
get
money
to
*NL*
get
drunk
on
--
and
loafs
around
considerable
;
but
lord
,
we
all
do
*NL*
that
--
leastways
most
of
us
--
preachers
and
such
like

But
he
's
kind
of
*NL*
good
--
he
give
me
half
a
fish
,
once
,
when
there
war
n't
enough
for
two
;
and
*NL*
lots
of
times
he
's
kind
of
stood
by
me
when
I
was
out
of
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
's
mended
kites
for
me
,
Huck
,
and
knitted
hooks
on
to
my
line

I
wish
we
could
get

out
of
there

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

we
could
n't
get
him
out
,
Tom
.
And
besides
,
`
twould
n't
do
any
good
;
*NL*
they
'd
ketch
him
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
so
they
would
.
But
I
hate
to
hear
'em
abuse
him
so
like
the
dickens
*NL*
when
he
never
done
--
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
too
,
Tom

Lord
,
I
hear
'em
say
he
's
the
bloodiest
looking
villain
*NL*
in
this
country
,
and
they
wonder
he
was
n't
ever
hung
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
talk
like
that
,
all
the
time

I
've
heard
'em
say
that
if
he
*NL*
was
to
get
free
they
'd
lynch
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
'd
do
it
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
had
a
long
talk
,
but
it
brought
them
little
comfort
.
As
the
*NL*
twilight
drew
on
,
they
found
themselves
hanging
about
the
neighborhood
*NL*
of
the
little
isolated
jail
,
perhaps
with
an
undefined
hope
that
*NL*
something
would
happen
that
might
clear
away
their
difficulties
.
But
*NL*
nothing
happened
;
there
seemed
to
be
no
angels
or
fairies
interested
in
*NL*
this
luckless
captive
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
did
as
they
had
often
done
before
--
went
to
the
cell
grating
and
*NL*
gave
Potter
some
tobacco
and
matches
.
He
was
on
the
ground
floor
and
*NL*
there
were
no
guards
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
gratitude
for
their
gifts
had
always
smote
their
consciences
*NL*
before
--
it
cut
deeper
than
ever
,
this
time
.
They
felt
cowardly
and
*NL*
treacherous
to
the
last
degree
when
Potter
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
mighty
good
to
me
,
boys
--
better
'n
anybody
else
in
this
town
.
*NL*
And
I
do
n't
forget
it
,
I
do
n't
.
Often
I
says
to
myself
,
says
I
,
'
I
used
*NL*
to
mend
all
the
boys
'
kites
and
things
,
and
show
'em
where
the
good
*NL*
fishin
'
places
was
,
and
befriend
'em
what
I
could
,
and
now
they
've
*NL*
all
forgot
old
Muff
when
he
's
in
trouble
;
but
Tom
do
n't
,
and
Huck
*NL*
do
n't
--
_
they
_
do
n't
forget
him
,
says
I
,
`
and
I
do
n't
forget
them
.
'
Well
,
*NL*
boys
,
I
done
an
awful
thing
--
drunk
and
crazy
at
the
time
--
that
's
the
only
*NL*
way
I
account
for
it
--
and
now
I
got
to
swing
for
it
,
and
it
's
right
.
*NL*
Right
,
and
_
best
_
,
too
,
I
reckon
--
hope
so
,
anyway
.
Well
,
we
wo
n't
talk
*NL*
about
that
.
I
do
n't
want
to
make
_
you
_
feel
bad
;
you
've
befriended
me
.
*NL*
But
what
I
want
to
say
,
is
,
do
n't
_
you
_
ever
get
drunk
--
then
you
wo
n't
*NL*
ever
get
here
.
Stand
a
litter
furder
west
--
so
--
that
's
it
;
it
's
a
prime
*NL*
comfort
to
see
faces
that
's
friendly
when
a
body
's
in
such
a
muck
*NL*
of
trouble
,
and
there
do
n't
none
come
here
but
yourn
.
Good
friendly
*NL*
faces
--
good
friendly
faces
.
Git
up
on
one
another
's
backs
and
let
me
*NL*
touch
'em
.
That
's
it
.
Shake
hands
--
yourn
'll
come
through
the
bars
,
but
*NL*
mine
's
too
big
.
Little
hands
,
and
weak
--
but
they
've
helped
Muff
Potter
a
*NL*
power
,
and
they
'd
help
him
more
if
they
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
went
home
miserable
,
and
his
dreams
that
night
were
full
of
horrors
.
*NL*
The
next
day
and
the
day
after
,
he
hung
about
the
courtroom
,
drawn
by
an
*NL*
almost
irresistible
impulse
to
go
in
,
but
forcing
himself
to
stay
out
.
*NL*
Huck
was
having
the
same
experience
.
They
studiously
avoided
each
other
.
*NL*
Each
wandered
away
,
from
time
to
time
,
but
the
same
dismal
fascination
*NL*
always
brought
them
back
presently
.
Tom
kept
his
ears
open
when
idlers
*NL*
sauntered
out
of
the
courtroom
,
but
invariably
heard
distressing
*NL*
news
--
the
toils
were
closing
more
and
more
relentlessly
around
poor
*NL*
Potter
.
At
the
end
of
the
second
day
the
village
talk
was
to
the
effect
*NL*
that
Injun
Joe
's
evidence
stood
firm
and
unshaken
,
and
that
there
was
*NL*
not
the
slightest
question
as
to
what
the
jury
's
verdict
would
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
out
late
,
that
night
,
and
came
to
bed
through
the
window
.
He
*NL*
was
in
a
tremendous
state
of
excitement
.
It
was
hours
before
he
got
to
*NL*
sleep
.
All
the
village
flocked
to
the
courthouse
the
next
morning
,
for
*NL*
this
was
to
be
the
great
day
.
Both
sexes
were
about
equally
represented
*NL*
in
the
packed
audience
.
After
a
long
wait
the
jury
filed
in
and
took
*NL*
their
places
;
shortly
afterward
,
Potter
,
pale
and
haggard
,
timid
and
*NL*
hopeless
,
was
brought
in
,
with
chains
upon
him
,
and
seated
where
all
*NL*
the
curious
eyes
could
stare
at
him
;
no
less
conspicuous
was
Injun
Joe
,
*NL*
stolid
as
ever
.
There
was
another
pause
,
and
then
the
judge
arrived
and
*NL*
the
sheriff
proclaimed
the
opening
of
the
court
.
The
usual
whisperings
*NL*
among
the
lawyers
and
gathering
together
of
papers
followed
.
These
*NL*
details
and
accompanying
delays
worked
up
an
atmosphere
of
preparation
*NL*
that
was
as
impressive
as
it
was
fascinating
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
a
witness
was
called
who
testified
that
he
found
Muff
Potter
washing
*NL*
in
the
brook
,
at
an
early
hour
of
the
morning
that
the
murder
was
*NL*
discovered
,
and
that
he
immediately
sneaked
away
.
After
some
further
*NL*
questioning
,
counsel
for
the
prosecution
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
the
witness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
raised
his
eyes
for
a
moment
,
but
dropped
them
again
when
*NL*
his
own
counsel
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
questions
to
ask
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
witness
proved
the
finding
of
the
knife
near
the
corpse
.
*NL*
Counsel
for
the
prosecution
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
the
witness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
questions
to
ask
him
,
''
Potter
's
lawyer
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
third
witness
swore
he
had
often
seen
the
knife
in
Potter
's
*NL*
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
the
witness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Counsel
for
Potter
declined
to
question
him
.
The
faces
of
the
audience
*NL*
began
to
betray
annoyance
.
Did
this
attorney
mean
to
throw
away
his
*NL*
client
's
life
without
an
effort
?
*NL*
*NL*
Several
witnesses
deposed
concerning
Potter
's
guilty
behavior
when
*NL*
brought
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
.
They
were
allowed
to
leave
the
stand
*NL*
without
being
cross-questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
detail
of
the
damaging
circumstances
that
occurred
in
the
*NL*
graveyard
upon
that
morning
which
all
present
remembered
so
well
was
*NL*
brought
out
by
credible
witnesses
,
but
none
of
them
were
cross-examined
*NL*
by
Potter
's
lawyer
.
The
perplexity
and
dissatisfaction
of
the
house
*NL*
expressed
itself
in
murmurs
and
provoked
a
reproof
from
the
bench
.
*NL*
Counsel
for
the
prosecution
now
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
oaths
of
citizens
whose
simple
word
is
above
suspicion
,
we
have
*NL*
fastened
this
awful
crime
,
beyond
all
possibility
of
question
,
upon
the
*NL*
unhappy
prisoner
at
the
bar
.
We
rest
our
case
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
groan
escaped
from
poor
Potter
,
and
he
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
*NL*
rocked
his
body
softly
to
and
fro
,
while
a
painful
silence
reigned
*NL*
in
the
courtroom
.
Many
men
were
moved
,
and
many
women
's
compassion
*NL*
testified
itself
in
tears
.
Counsel
for
the
defence
rose
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
honor
,
in
our
remarks
at
the
opening
of
this
trial
,
we
*NL*
foreshadowed
our
purpose
to
prove
that
our
client
did
this
fearful
deed
*NL*
while
under
the
influence
of
a
blind
and
irresponsible
delirium
produced
*NL*
by
drink
.
We
have
changed
our
mind
.
We
shall
not
offer
that
plea

Then
*NL*
to
the
clerk
:]
``
Call
Thomas
Sawyer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
puzzled
amazement
awoke
in
every
face
in
the
house
,
not
even
excepting
*NL*
Potter
's
.
Every
eye
fastened
itself
with
wondering
interest
upon
Tom
as
*NL*
he
rose
and
took
his
place
upon
the
stand
.
The
boy
looked
wild
enough
,
*NL*
for
he
was
badly
scared
.
The
oath
was
administered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thomas
Sawyer
,
where
were
you
on
the
seventeenth
of
June
,
about
the
*NL*
hour
of
midnight

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
glanced
at
Injun
Joe
's
iron
face
and
his
tongue
failed
him
.
The
*NL*
audience
listened
breathless
,
but
the
words
refused
to
come
.
After
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
however
,
the
boy
got
a
little
of
his
strength
back
,
and
managed
*NL*
to
put
enough
of
it
into
his
voice
to
make
part
of
the
house
hear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
graveyard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
bit
louder
,
please

Do
n't
be
afraid
.
You
were
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
graveyard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
contemptuous
smile
flitted
across
Injun
Joe
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
anywhere
near
Horse
Williams

grave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

just
a

louder

*NL*
*NL*
``
Near

I
am
to
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
hidden

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behind
the
elms
that
's
on
the
edge
of
the
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Injun
Joe
gave
a
barely
perceptible
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
one
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Did

anything
there
with

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
hesitated
and
looked
confused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
out
,
my
boy

do
n't
be
diffident

The
truth
is
always
respectable

*NL*
What
did
you
take
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
--
a

dead
cat

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
ripple
of
mirth
,
which
the
court
checked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
produce
the
skeleton
of
that
cat

Now

my

tell

*NL*
everything
that

tell

in
your

way

skip
anything

*NL*
and
do
n't
be
afraid

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
began
--
hesitatingly
at
first
,
but
as
he
warmed
to
his
subject
his
*NL*
words
flowed
more
and
more
easily
;
in
a
little
while
every
sound
ceased
*NL*
but
his
own
voice
;
every
eye
fixed
itself
upon
him
;
with
parted
lips
and
*NL*
bated
breath
the
audience
hung
upon
his
words
,
taking
no
note
of
time
,
*NL*
rapt
in
the
ghastly
fascinations
of
the
tale
.
The
strain
upon
pent
*NL*
emotion
reached
its
climax
when
the
boy
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
and
as
the
doctor
fetched
the
board
around
and
Muff
Potter
fell
,
Injun
*NL*
Joe
jumped
with
the
knife
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Crash
!
Quick
as
lightning
the
halfbreed
sprang
for
a
window
,
tore
his
*NL*
way
through
all
opposers
,
and
was
gone

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
TOM
was
a
glittering
hero
once
more
--
the
pet
of
the
old
,
the
envy
of
the
*NL*
young
.
His
name
even
went
into
immortal
print
,
for
the
village
paper
*NL*
magnified
him
.
There
were
some
that
believed
he
would
be
President
,
yet
,
*NL*
if
he
escaped
hanging
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
usual
,
the
fickle
,
unreasoning
world
took
Muff
Potter
to
its
bosom
*NL*
and
fondled
him
as
lavishly
as
it
had
abused
him
before
.
But
that
sort
*NL*
of
conduct
is
to
the
world
's
credit
;
therefore
it
is
not
well
to
find
*NL*
fault
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
days
were
days
of
splendor
and
exultation
to
him
,
but
his
nights
*NL*
were
seasons
of
horror
.
Injun
Joe
infested
all
his
dreams
,
and
always
*NL*
with
doom
in
his
eye
.
Hardly
any
temptation
could
persuade
the
boy
*NL*
to
stir
abroad
after
nightfall
.
Poor
Huck
was
in
the
same
state
of
*NL*
wretchedness
and
terror
,
for
Tom
had
told
the
whole
story
to
the
lawyer
*NL*
the
night
before
the
great
day
of
the
trial
,
and
Huck
was
sore
afraid
*NL*
that
his
share
in
the
business
might
leak
out
,
yet
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
Injun
Joe
's
flight
had
saved
him
the
suffering
of
testifying
in
court
.
*NL*
The
poor
fellow
had
got
the
attorney
to
promise
secrecy
,
but
what
of
*NL*
that
?
Since
Tom
's
harassed
conscience
had
managed
to
drive
him
to
the
*NL*
lawyer
's
house
by
night
and
wring
a
dread
tale
from
lips
that
had
*NL*
been
sealed
with
the
dismalest
and
most
formidable
of
oaths
,
Huck
's
*NL*
confidence
in
the
human
race
was
wellnigh
obliterated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daily
Muff
Potter
's
gratitude
made
Tom
glad
he
had
spoken
;
but
nightly
*NL*
he
wished
he
had
sealed
up
his
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
the
time
Tom
was
afraid
Injun
Joe
would
never
be
captured
;
the
*NL*
other
half
he
was
afraid
he
would
be
.
He
felt
sure
he
never
could
draw
a
*NL*
safe
breath
again
until
that
man
was
dead
and
he
had
seen
the
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rewards
had
been
offered
,
the
country
had
been
scoured
,
but
no
Injun
*NL*
Joe
was
found
.
One
of
those
omniscient
and
aweinspiring
marvels
,
a
*NL*
detective
,
came
up
from
St.
Louis
,
moused
around
,
shook
his
head
,
looked
*NL*
wise
,
and
made
that
sort
of
astounding
success
which
members
of
that
*NL*
craft
usually
achieve
.
That
is
to
say
,
he
``
found
a
clew
.
''
But
you
ca
n't
*NL*
hang
a
``
clew
''
for
murder
,
and
so
after
that
detective
had
got
through
*NL*
and
gone
home
,
Tom
felt
just
as
insecure
as
he
was
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slow
days
drifted
on
,
and
each
left
behind
it
a
slightly
lightened
*NL*
weight
of
apprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
THERE
comes
a
time
in
every
rightly-constructed
boy
's
life
when
he
has
*NL*
a
raging
desire
to
go
somewhere
and
dig
for
hidden
treasure
.
This
desire
*NL*
suddenly
came
upon
Tom
one
day
.
He
sallied
out
to
find
Joe
Harper
,
*NL*
but
failed
of
success
.
Next
he
sought
Ben
Rogers
;
he
had
gone
fishing
.
*NL*
Presently
he
stumbled
upon
Huck
Finn
the
Red-Handed
.
Huck
would
*NL*
answer
.
Tom
took
him
to
a
private
place
and
opened
the
matter
to
him
*NL*
confidentially
.
Huck
was
willing
.
Huck
was
always
willing
to
take
a
hand
*NL*
in
any
enterprise
that
offered
entertainment
and
required
no
capital
,
*NL*
for
he
had
a
troublesome
superabundance
of
that
sort
of
time
which
is
*NL*
not
money
.
``
Where
'll
we
dig
?
''
said
Huck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
most
anywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
is
it
hid
all
around
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
it
ai
n't
.
It
's
hid
in
mighty
particular
places
,
*NL*
Huck
--
sometimes
on
islands
,
sometimes
in
rotten
chests
under
the
end
of
*NL*
a
limb
of
an
old
dead
tree
,
just
where
the
shadow
falls
at
midnight
;
but
*NL*
mostly
under
the
floor
in
ha
`
nted
houses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
hides
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
robbers
,
of
course
--
who
'd
you
reckon
?
Sunday-school
*NL*
sup
`
rintendents
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
If
't
was
mine
I
would
n't
hide
it
;
I
'd
spend
it
and
have
a
*NL*
good
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
would
I
.
But
robbers
do
n't
do
that
way
.
They
always
hide
it
and
*NL*
leave
it
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
they
come
after
it
any
more
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
they
think
they
will

but
they
generally
forget
the
marks

or
else

die

Anyway
,
it
lays
there
a
long
time
and
gets
rusty
;
and
by
and
*NL*
by
somebody
finds
an
old
yellow
paper
that
tells
how
to
find
the
marks

a
*NL*
paper
that
's
got
to
be
ciphered
over
about
a
week

signs

``

only

a

name
,
like
a
nigger

But
say
--
where
you
going
*NL*
to
dig
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't

S'pose
we
tackle
that
old
dead-limb
tree
on
the
*NL*
hill
t
`
other
side
of
Still-House
branch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
agreed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
got
a
crippled
pick
and
a
shovel
,
and
set
out
on
their
*NL*
three-mile
tramp
.
They
arrived
hot
and
panting
,
and
threw
themselves
*NL*
down
in
the
shade
of
a
neighboring
elm
to
rest
and
have
a
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
this

said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So

I.

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*

*NL*

*NL*

Why

*NL*
*NL*

Oh

that

some

get
his
claws
on
it

I
did

up

I
tell

clean

*NL*
``
It

all
the

,
I
reckon
;
some
says

some
says

right
,
like
enough
.
Anyway
,
what
's
her

,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
some
time

not
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right

that
'll
do

Only
if

I
'll
be

*NL*
``
No

Now
stir
out
of

*NL*
we
'll
go
to
digging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
worked
and
sweated
for
half
an
hour
.
No
result
.
They
toiled
another
*NL*
halfhour
.
Still
no
result
.
Huck
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
they
always
bury
it
as
deep
as
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes

not
always

Not
generally

I
reckon
we
have
n't
got
the
right
*NL*
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
chose
a
new
spot
and
began
again
.
The
labor
dragged
a
little
,
*NL*
but
still
they
made
progress
.
They
pegged
away
in
silence
for
some
time
.
*NL*
Finally
Huck
leaned
on
his
shovel
,
swabbed
the
beaded
drops
from
his
*NL*
brow
with
his
sleeve
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
you
going
to
dig
next
,
after
we
get
this
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
maybe
we
'll
tackle
the
old
tree
that
's
over
yonder
on
Cardiff
*NL*
Hill
back
of
the
widow
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
that
'll
be
a
good
one

But
wo
n't
the
widow
take
it
away
from

us
,
Tom
?
It
's
on
her
land
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
She
_
take
it
away
!
Maybe
she
'd
like
to
try
it
once
.
Whoever
finds
one
*NL*
of
these
hid
treasures
,
it
belongs
to
him
.
It
do
n't
make
any
difference
*NL*
whose
land
it
's
on

''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
satisfactory
.
The
work
went
on
.
By
and
by
Huck
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blame
it
,
we
must
be
in
the
wrong
place
again

What
do
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
mighty
curious
,
Huck
.
I
do
n't
understand
it

Sometimes
witches
*NL*
interfere

I
reckon
maybe
that
's
what
's
the
trouble
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shucks

*NL*
*NL*

so

Oh

I

what
the
matter
is
!
*NL*
What
a

lot
of
fools
we
are

You
got
to
find
out
where
the
shadow

of
the
limb
falls
at
midnight
,

that
's
where
you
dig
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
consound
it
,
we
've
fooled
away
all
this
work
for
nothing

Now
hang
*NL*
it
all

we
got
to
come
back
in
the
night
.
It
's
an
awful
long
way
.
Can
*NL*
you
get
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
I
will
.
We
've
got
to
do
it
tonight
,
too
,
because
if
somebody
sees
*NL*
these
holes
they
'll
know
in
a
minute
what
's
here
and
they
'll
go
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
'll
come
around
and
maow
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right

Let
's
hide
the
tools
in
the
bushes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
were
there
that
night
,
about
the
appointed
time
.
They
sat
in
*NL*
the
shadow
waiting
.
It
was
a
lonely
place
,
and
an
hour
made
solemn
by
*NL*
old
traditions
.
Spirits
whispered
in
the
rustling
leaves
,
ghosts
lurked
*NL*
in
the
murky
nooks
,
the
deep
baying
of
a
hound
floated
up
out
of
the
*NL*
distance
,
an
owl
answered
with
his
sepulchral
note
.
The
boys
were
*NL*
subdued
by
these
solemnities
,
and
talked
little
.
By
and
by
they
judged
*NL*
that
twelve
had
come
;
they
marked
where
the
shadow
fell
,
and
began
to
*NL*
dig
.
Their
hopes
commenced
to
rise
.
Their
interest
grew
stronger
,
and
*NL*
their
industry
kept
pace
with
it
.
The
hole
deepened
and
still
deepened
,
*NL*
but
every
time
their
hearts
jumped
to
hear
the
pick
strike
upon
*NL*
something
,
they
only
suffered
a
new
disappointment
.
It
was
only
a
stone
*NL*
or
a
chunk
.
At
last
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ai
n't
any
use
,
Huck
,
we
're
wrong
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
we
_
ca
n't
_
be
wrong
.
We
spotted
the
shadder
to
a
dot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
but
then
there
's
another
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
we
only
guessed
at
the
time
.
Like
enough
it
was
too
late
or
too
*NL*
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
dropped
his
shovel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
,
''
said
he
.
``
That
's
the
very
trouble

got

up

the
right
time

and
besides
this
kind
of
thing
's
*NL*
too
awful
,
here
this
time
of
night
with
witches

ghosts
a-fluttering
*NL*
around
so

I
feel
as

something
's
behind

all
the
time

I

afeard

around

pretty

considered
awhile

then
said

worse

sliding
around

noticing

peep
over

all
of
a
sudden

nothing

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
started
down
the
hill
by
this
time
.
There
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
moonlit
valley
below
them
stood
the
``
ha

nted
''
house
,
utterly
isolated
,
*NL*
its
fences
gone
long
ago
,
rank
weeds
smothering
the
very
doorsteps
,
the
*NL*
chimney
crumbled
to
ruin
,
the
window-sashes
vacant
,
a
corner
of
the
roof
*NL*
caved
in
.
The
boys
gazed
awhile
,
half
expecting
to
see
a
blue
light
flit
*NL*
past
a
window
;
then
talking
in
a
low
tone
,
as
befitted
the
time
and
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
they
struck
far
off
to
the
right
,
to
give
the
haunted
*NL*
house
a
wide
berth
,
and
took
their
way
homeward
through
the
woods
that
*NL*
adorned
the
rearward
side
of
Cardiff
Hill

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
ABOUT
noon
the
next
day
the
boys
arrived
at
the
dead
tree
;
they
had
come
*NL*
for
their
tools
.
Tom
was
impatient
to
go
to
the
haunted
house
;
Huck
was
*NL*
measurably
so
,
also
--
but
suddenly
said
:

*NL*
``
Lookyhere

Tom

you
know
what
day
it
is

*NL*
*NL*
Tom
mentally
ran
over
the
days
of
the
week
,
and
then
quickly
lifted
his

eyes
with
a
startled
look
in
them
--

*NL*
``

I
never
once
thought
of
it

you
know
.
All
we
got
to
do
is
to
look
mighty
*NL*
sharp
and
keep
out
of
it
.
We
'll
drop
this
thing
for
today
,
and
play
.
Do
*NL*
you
know
Robin
Hood
,
Huck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Who
's
Robin
Hood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
men
that
was
ever
in
England
--
and
the
*NL*
best
.
He
was
a
robber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cracky
,
I
wisht
I
was
.
Who
did
he
rob
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
sheriffs
and
bishops
and
rich
people
and
kings
,
and
such
like
.
But
*NL*
he
never
bothered
the
poor
.
He
loved
'em
.
He
always
divided
up
with
'em
*NL*
perfectly
square
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
must
`
a
'
been
a
brick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bet
you
he
was
,
Huck
.
Oh
,
he
was
the
noblest
man
that
ever
was
.
*NL*
They
ai
n't
any
such
men
now
,
I
can
tell
you
.
He
could
lick
any
man
in
*NL*
England
,
with
one
hand
tied
behind
him
;
and
he
could
take
his
yew
bow
*NL*
and
plug
a
ten-cent
piece
every
time
,
a
mile
and
a
half
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a
_
yew
_
bow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
It
's
some
kind
of
a
bow
,
of
course
.
And
if
he
hit
that
*NL*
dime
only
on
the
edge
he
would
set
down
and
cry
--
and
curse
.
But
we
'll
*NL*
play
Robin
Hood
--
it
's
nobby
fun
.
I
'll
learn
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
agreed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
played
Robin
Hood
all
the
afternoon
,
now
and
then
casting
a
*NL*
yearning
eye
down
upon
the
haunted
house
and
passing
a
remark
about
the
*NL*
morrow
's
prospects
and
possibilities
there
.
As
the
sun
began
to
sink
*NL*
into
the
west
they
took
their
way
homeward
athwart
the
long
shadows
*NL*
of
the
trees
and
soon
were
buried
from
sight
in
the
forests
of
Cardiff
*NL*
Hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Saturday
,
shortly
after
noon
,
the
boys
were
at
the
dead
tree
again
.
*NL*
They
had
a
smoke
and
a
chat
in
the
shade
,
and
then
dug
a
little
in
their
*NL*
last
hole
,
not
with
great
hope
,
but
merely
because
Tom
said
there
were
*NL*
so
many
cases
where
people
had
given
up
a
treasure
after
getting
down
*NL*
within
six
inches
of
it
,
and
then
somebody
else
had
come
along
and
*NL*
turned
it
up
with
a
single
thrust
of
a
shovel
.
The
thing
failed
this
*NL*
time
,
however
,
so
the
boys
shouldered
their
tools
and
went
away
feeling
*NL*
that
they
had
not
trifled
with
fortune
,
but
had
fulfilled
all
the
*NL*
requirements
that
belong
to
the
business
of
treasure-hunting
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
reached
the
haunted
house
there
was
something
so
weird
and
*NL*
grisly
about
the
dead
silence
that
reigned
there
under
the
baking
sun
,
*NL*
and
something
so
depressing
about
the
loneliness
and
desolation
of
the
*NL*
place
,
that
they
were
afraid
,
for
a
moment
,
to
venture
in
.
Then
they
*NL*
crept
to
the
door
and
took
a
trembling
peep
.
They
saw
a
weedgrown
,
*NL*
floorless
room
,
unplastered
,
an
ancient
fireplace
,
vacant
windows
,
*NL*
a
ruinous
staircase
;
and
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
hung
ragged
and
*NL*
abandoned
cobwebs
.
They
presently
entered
,
softly
,
with
quickened
*NL*
pulses
,
talking
in
whispers
,
ears
alert
to
catch
the
slightest
sound
,
*NL*
and
muscles
tense
and
ready
for
instant
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
little
while
familiarity
modified
their
fears
and
they
gave
the
*NL*
place
a
critical
and
interested
examination
,
rather
admiring
their
own
*NL*
boldness
,
and
wondering
at
it
,
too
.
Next
they
wanted
to
look
upstairs
.
*NL*
This
was
something
like
cutting
off
retreat
,
but
they
got
to
daring
*NL*
each
other
,
and
of
course
there
could
be
but
one
result
--
they
threw
their
*NL*
tools
into
a
corner
and
made
the
ascent
.
Up
there
were
the
same
signs
of
*NL*
decay
.
In
one
corner
they
found
a
closet
that
promised
mystery
,
but
the
*NL*
promise
was
a
fraud
--
there
was
nothing
in
it
.
Their
courage
was
up
now
*NL*
and
well
in
hand
.
They
were
about
to
go
down
and
begin
work
when
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sh
!
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
whispered
Huck
,
blanching
with
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sh
!
...
There
!
...
Hear
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
...
Oh
,
my
!
Let
's
run
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
still
!
Do
n't
you
budge
!
They
're
coming
right
toward
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
stretched
themselves
upon
the
floor
with
their
eyes
to
*NL*
knotholes
in
the
planking
,
and
lay
waiting
,
in
a
misery
of
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
've
stopped
...
No
--
coming
...
Here
they
are
.
Do
n't
whisper
another
*NL*
word
,
Huck
.
My
goodness
,
I
wish
I
was
out
of
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
men
entered
.
Each
boy
said
to
himself
:
``
There
's
the
old
deaf
and
*NL*
dumb
Spaniard
that
's
been
about
town
once
or
twice
lately
--
never
saw
*NL*
t
`
other
man
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
T'other
''
was
a
ragged
,
unkempt
creature
,
with
nothing
very
pleasant
*NL*
in
his
face
.
The
Spaniard
was
wrapped
in
a
serape
;
he
had
bushy
white
*NL*
whiskers
;
long
white
hair
flowed
from
under
his
sombrero
,
and
he
wore
*NL*
green
goggles
.
When
they
came
in
,
``
t
`
other
''
was
talking
in
a
low
voice
;
*NL*
they
sat
down
on
the
ground
,
facing
the
door
,
with
their
backs
to
the
*NL*
wall
,
and
the
speaker
continued
his
remarks
.
His
manner
became
less
*NL*
guarded
and
his
words
more
distinct
as
he
proceeded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
've
thought
it
all
over
,
and
I
do
n't
like
it
.
It
's
*NL*
dangerous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dangerous
!
''
grunted
the
``
deaf
and
dumb
''
Spaniard
--
to
the
vast
surprise
*NL*
of
the
boys
.
``
Milksop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
voice
made
the
boys
gasp
and
quake
.
It
was
Injun
Joe
's
!
There
was
*NL*
silence
for
some
time
.
Then
Joe
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
any
more
dangerous
than
that
job
up
yonder
--
but
nothing
's
come
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
different
.
Away
up
the
river
so
,
and
not
another
house
about
.
*NL*
`
Two
n't
ever
be
known
that
we
tried
,
anyway
,
long
as
we
did
n't
succeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
's
more
dangerous
than
coming
here
in
the
daytime
!
--
anybody
*NL*
would
suspicion
us
that
saw
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
.
But
there
war
n't
any
other
place
as
handy
after
that
fool
*NL*
of
a
job
.
I
want
to
quit
this
shanty
.
I
wanted
to
yesterday
,
only
it
*NL*
war
n't
any
use
trying
to
stir
out
of
here
,
with
those
infernal
boys
*NL*
playing
over
there
on
the
hill
right
in
full
view
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
infernal
boys
''
quaked
again
under
the
inspiration
of
this
remark
,
*NL*
and
thought
how
lucky
it
was
that
they
had
remembered
it
was
Friday
and
*NL*
concluded
to
wait
a
day
.
They
wished
in
their
hearts
they
had
waited
a
*NL*
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
got
out
some
food
and
made
a
luncheon
.
After
a
long
and
*NL*
thoughtful
silence
,
Injun
Joe
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
lad
--
you
go
back
up
the
river
where
you
belong
.
Wait
there
*NL*
till
you
hear
from
me
.
I
'll
take
the
chances
on
dropping
into
this
town
*NL*
just
once
more
,
for
a
look
.
We
'll
do
that
`
dangerous
'
job
after
I
've
*NL*
spied
around
a
little
and
think
things
look
well
for
it
.
Then
for
Texas
!
*NL*
We
'll
leg
it
together
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
satisfactory
.
Both
men
presently
fell
to
yawning
,
and
Injun
Joe
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
dead
for
sleep
!
It
's
your
turn
to
watch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
curled
down
in
the
weeds
and
soon
began
to
snore
.
His
comrade
stirred
*NL*
him
once
or
twice
and
he
became
quiet
.
Presently
the
watcher
began
to
*NL*
nod
;
his
head
drooped
lower
and
lower
,
both
men
began
to
snore
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
drew
a
long
,
grateful
breath
.
Tom
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
's
our
chance
--
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
--
I
'd
die
if
they
was
to
wake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
urged
--
Huck
held
back
.
At
last
Tom
rose
slowly
and
softly
,
and
*NL*
started
alone
.
But
the
first
step
he
made
wrung
such
a
hideous
creak
*NL*
from
the
crazy
floor
that
he
sank
down
almost
dead
with
fright
.
He
never
*NL*
made
a
second
attempt
.
The
boys
lay
there
counting
the
dragging
moments
*NL*
till
it
seemed
to
them
that
time
must
be
done
and
eternity
growing
gray
;
*NL*
and
then
they
were
grateful
to
note
that
at
last
the
sun
was
setting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
one
snore
ceased
.
Injun
Joe
sat
up
,
stared
around
--
smiled
grimly
upon
*NL*
his
comrade
,
whose
head
was
drooping
upon
his
knees
--
stirred
him
up
with
*NL*
his
foot
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
_
You
're
_
a
watchman
,
ai
n't
you
!
All
right
,
though
--
nothing
's
*NL*
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
!
have
I
been
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
partly
,
partly
.
Nearly
time
for
us
to
be
moving
,
pard
.
What
'll
we
*NL*
do
with
what
little
swag
we
've
got
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
leave
it
here
as
we
've
always
done
,
I
reckon
.
No
use
to
*NL*
take
it
away
till
we
start
south
.
Six
hundred
and
fifty
in
silver
's
*NL*
something
to
carry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
all
right
--
it
wo
n't
matter
to
come
here
once
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
but
I
'd
say
come
in
the
night
as
we
used
to
do
--
it
's
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
:
but
look
here
;
it
may
be
a
good
while
before
I
get
the
right
*NL*
chance
at
that
job
;
accidents
might
happen
;
`
tai
n't
in
such
a
very
good
*NL*
place
;
we
'll
just
regularly
bury
it
--
and
bury
it
deep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
idea
,
''
said
the
comrade
,
who
walked
across
the
room
,
knelt
down
,
*NL*
raised
one
of
the
rearward
hearth-stones
and
took
out
a
bag
that
jingled
*NL*
pleasantly
.
He
subtracted
from
it
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
for
himself
*NL*
and
as
much
for
Injun
Joe
,
and
passed
the
bag
to
the
latter
,
who
was
on
*NL*
his
knees
in
the
corner
,
now
,
digging
with
his
bowie-knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
forgot
all
their
fears
,
all
their
miseries
in
an
instant
.
With
*NL*
gloating
eyes
they
watched
every
movement
.
Luck
!
--
the
splendor
of
it
was
*NL*
beyond
all
imagination
!
Six
hundred
dollars
was
money
enough
to
make
*NL*
half
a
dozen
boys
rich
!
Here
was
treasure-hunting
under
the
happiest
*NL*
auspices
--
there
would
not
be
any
bothersome
uncertainty
as
to
where
to
*NL*
dig
.
They
nudged
each
other
every
moment
--
eloquent
nudges
and
easily
*NL*
understood
,
for
they
simply
meant
--
``
Oh
,
but
ai
n't
you
glad
_
now
_
we
're
*NL*
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
's
knife
struck
upon
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
his
comrade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half-rotten
plank
--
no
,
it
's
a
box
,
I
believe
.
Here
--
bear
a
hand
and
we
'll
*NL*
see
what
it
's
here
for
.
Never
mind
,
I
've
broke
a
hole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
his
hand
in
and
drew
it
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
,
it
's
money
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
examined
the
handful
of
coins
.
They
were
gold
.
The
boys
*NL*
above
were
as
excited
as
themselves
,
and
as
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
's
comrade
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
make
quick
work
of
this
.
There
's
an
old
rusty
pick
over
amongst
*NL*
the
weeds
in
the
corner
the
other
side
of
the
fireplace
--
I
saw
it
a
*NL*
minute
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ran
and
brought
the
boys
'
pick
and
shovel
.
Injun
Joe
took
the
*NL*
pick
,
looked
it
over
critically
,
shook
his
head
,
muttered
something
to
*NL*
himself
,
and
then
began
to
use
it
.
The
box
was
soon
unearthed
.
It
was
*NL*
not
very
large
;
it
was
iron
bound
and
had
been
very
strong
before
the
*NL*
slow
years
had
injured
it
.
The
men
contemplated
the
treasure
awhile
in
*NL*
blissful
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pard
,
there
's
thousands
of
dollars
here
,
''
said
Injun
Joe
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
always
said
that
Murrel
's
gang
used
to
be
around
here
one
*NL*
summer
,
''
the
stranger
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
,
''
said
Injun
Joe
;
``
and
this
looks
like
it
,
I
should
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
wo
n't
need
to
do
that
job
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
halfbreed
frowned
.
Said
he
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
me
.
Least
you

``
All

It
's
nearly
dark

''
*NL*
*NL*
Injun
Joe
got
up
and
went
about
from
window
to
window
cautiously
peeping
*NL*
out
.
Presently
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
could
have
brought
those
tools
here
?
Do
you
reckon
they
can
be
*NL*
upstairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
'
breath
forsook
them
.
Injun
Joe
put
his
hand
on
his
knife
,
*NL*
halted
a
moment
,
undecided
,
and
then
turned
toward
the
stairway
.
The
*NL*
boys
thought
of
the
closet
,
but
their
strength
was
gone
.
The
steps
came
*NL*
creaking
up
the
stairs
--
the
intolerable
distress
of
the
situation
woke
*NL*
the
stricken
resolution
of
the
lads
--
they
were
about
to
spring
for
the
*NL*
closet
,
when
there
was
a
crash
of
rotten
timbers
and
Injun
Joe
landed
on
*NL*
the
ground
amid
the
debris
of
the
ruined
stairway
.
He
gathered
himself
*NL*
up
cursing
,
and
his
comrade
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
what
's
the
use
of
all
that
?
If
it
's
anybody
,
and
they
're
up
there
,
*NL*
let
them
_
stay
_
there
--
who
cares
?
If
they
want
to
jump
down
,
now
,
and
get
*NL*
into
trouble
,
who
objects
?
It
will
be
dark
in
fifteen
minutes
--
and
then
*NL*
let
them
follow
us
if
they
want
to
.
I
'm
willing
.
In
my
opinion
,
whoever
*NL*
hove
those
things
in
here
caught
a
sight
of
us
and
took
us
for
ghosts
or
*NL*
devils
or
something
.
I
'll
bet
they
're
running
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
grumbled
awhile
;
then
he
agreed
with
his
friend
that
what
daylight
*NL*
was
left
ought
to
be
economized
in
getting
things
ready
for
leaving
.
*NL*
Shortly
afterward
they
slipped
out
of
the
house
in
the
deepening
*NL*
twilight
,
and
moved
toward
the
river
with
their
precious
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
and
Huck
rose
up
,
weak
but
vastly
relieved
,
and
stared
after
them
*NL*
through
the
chinks
between
the
logs
of
the
house
.
Follow
?
Not
they
.
They
*NL*
were
content
to
reach
ground
again
without
broken
necks
,
and
take
the
*NL*
townward
track
over
the
hill
.
They
did
not
talk
much
.
They
were
too
much
*NL*
absorbed
in
hating
themselves
--
hating
the
ill
luck
that
made
them
take
*NL*
the
spade
and
the
pick
there
.
But
for
that
,
Injun
Joe
never
would
have
*NL*
suspected
.
He
would
have
hidden
the
silver
with
the
gold
to
wait
*NL*
there
till
his
``
revenge
''
was
satisfied
,
and
then
he
would
have
had
the
*NL*
misfortune
to
find
that
money
turn
up
missing
.
Bitter
,
bitter
luck
that
*NL*
the
tools
were
ever
brought
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
resolved
to
keep
a
lookout
for
that
Spaniard
when
he
should
come
to
*NL*
town
spying
out
for
chances
to
do
his
revengeful
job
,
and
follow
him
to
*NL*
``
Number
Two
,
''
wherever
that
might
be
.
Then
a
ghastly
thought
occurred
to
*NL*
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Revenge
?
What
if
he
means
_
us
_
,
Huck
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
!
''
said
Huck
,
nearly
fainting
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
it
all
over
,
and
as
they
entered
town
they
agreed
to
believe
*NL*
that
he
might
possibly
mean
somebody
else
--
at
least
that
he
might
at
*NL*
least
mean
nobody
but
Tom
,
since
only
Tom
had
testified
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
,
very
small
comfort
it
was
to
Tom
to
be
alone
in
danger
!
Company
*NL*
would
be
a
palpable
improvement
,
he
thought
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
THE
adventure
of
the
day
mightily
tormented
Tom
's
dreams
that
night
.
*NL*
Four
times
he
had
his
hands
on
that
rich
treasure
and
four
times
*NL*
it
wasted
to
nothingness
in
his
fingers
as
sleep
forsook
him
and
*NL*
wakefulness
brought
back
the
hard
reality
of
his
misfortune
.
As
he
lay
*NL*
in
the
early
morning
recalling
the
incidents
of
his
great
adventure
,
he
*NL*
noticed
that
they
seemed
curiously
subdued
and
far
away
--
somewhat
as
if
*NL*
they
had
happened
in
another
world
,
or
in
a
time
long
gone
by
.
Then
it
*NL*
occurred
to
him
that
the
great
adventure
itself
must
be
a
dream
!
There
*NL*
was
one
very
strong
argument
in
favor
of
this
idea
--
namely
,
that
the
*NL*
quantity
of
coin
he
had
seen
was
too
vast
to
be
real
.
He
had
never
seen
*NL*
as
much
as
fifty
dollars
in
one
mass
before
,
and
he
was
like
all
boys
of
*NL*
his
age
and
station
in
life
,
in
that
he
imagined
that
all
references
to
*NL*
``
hundreds
''
and
``
thousands
''
were
mere
fanciful
forms
of
speech
,
and
that
*NL*
no
such
sums
really
existed
in
the
world
.
He
never
had
supposed
for
*NL*
a
moment
that
so
large
a
sum
as
a
hundred
dollars
was
to
be
found
in
*NL*
actual
money
in
any
one
's
possession
.
If
his
notions
of
hidden
treasure
*NL*
had
been
analyzed
,
they
would
have
been
found
to
consist
of
a
handful
of
*NL*
real
dimes
and
a
bushel
of
vague
,
splendid
,
ungraspable
dollars
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
incidents
of
his
adventure
grew
sensibly
sharper
and
clearer
*NL*
under
the
attrition
of
thinking
them
over
,
and
so
he
presently
found
*NL*
himself
leaning
to
the
impression
that
the
thing
might
not
have
been
a
*NL*
dream
,
after
all
.
This
uncertainty
must
be
swept
away
.
He
would
snatch
a
*NL*
hurried
breakfast
and
go
and
find
Huck
.
Huck
was
sitting
on
the
gunwale
*NL*
of
a
flatboat
,
listlessly
dangling
his
feet
in
the
water
and
looking
*NL*
very
melancholy
.
Tom
concluded
to
let
Huck
lead
up
to
the
subject
.
If
*NL*
he
did
not
do
it
,
then
the
adventure
would
be
proved
to
have
been
only
a
*NL*
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
Huck
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
,
for
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

left

``
You

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
off
at
once
.
He
did
not
care
to
have
Huck
's
company
in
public
*NL*
places
.
He
was
gone
half
an
hour
.
He
found
that
in
the
best
tavern
,
No.
*NL*
2
had
long
been
occupied
by
a
young
lawyer
,
and
was
still
so
occupied
.
*NL*
In
the
less
ostentatious
house
,
No.
2
was
a
mystery
.
The
tavern-keeper
's
*NL*
young
son
said
it
was
kept
locked
all
the
time
,
and
he
never
saw
anybody
*NL*
go
into
it
or
come
out
of
it
except
at
night
;
he
did
not
know
any
*NL*
particular
reason
for
this
state
of
things
;
had
had
some
little
*NL*
curiosity
,
but
it
was
rather
feeble
;
had
made
the
most
of
the
mystery
*NL*
by
entertaining
himself
with
the
idea
that
that
room
was
``
ha
`
nted
''
;
had
*NL*
noticed
that
there
was
a
light
in
there
the
night
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
what
I
've
found
out

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
THAT
night
Tom
and
Huck
were
ready
for
their
adventure
.
They
hung
about
*NL*
the
neighborhood
of
the
tavern
until
after
nine
,
one
watching
the
alley
*NL*
at
a
distance
and
the
other
the
tavern
door
.
Nobody
entered
the
alley
or
*NL*
left
it
;
nobody
resembling
the
Spaniard
entered
or
left
the
tavern
*NL*
door
.
The
night
promised
to
be
a
fair
one
;
so
Tom
went
home
with
the
*NL*
understanding
that
if
a
considerable
degree
of
darkness
came
on
,
Huck
*NL*
was
to
come
and
``
maow
,
''
whereupon
he
would
slip
out
and
try
the
keys
.
*NL*
But
the
night
remained
clear
,
and
Huck
closed
his
watch
and
retired
to
*NL*
bed
in
an
empty
sugar
hogshead
about
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tuesday
the
boys
had
the
same
ill
luck
.
Also
Wednesday
.
But
Thursday
*NL*
night
promised
better
.
Tom
slipped
out
in
good
season
with
his
aunt
's
*NL*
old
tin
lantern
,
and
a
large
towel
to
blindfold
it
with
.
He
hid
the
*NL*
lantern
in
Huck
's
sugar
hogshead
and
the
watch
began
.
An
hour
before
*NL*
midnight
the
tavern
closed
up
and
its
lights
-LRB-
the
only
ones
thereabouts
-RRB-
*NL*
were
put
out
.
No
Spaniard
had
been
seen
.
Nobody
had
entered
or
left
the
*NL*
alley
.
Everything
was
auspicious
.
The
blackness
of
darkness
reigned
,
*NL*
the
perfect
stillness
was
interrupted
only
by
occasional
mutterings
of
*NL*
distant
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
got
his
lantern
,
lit
it
in
the
hogshead
,
wrapped
it
closely
in
the
*NL*
towel
,
and
the
two
adventurers
crept
in
the
gloom
toward
the
tavern
.
*NL*
Huck
stood
sentry
and
Tom
felt
his
way
into
the
alley
.
Then
there
was
*NL*
a
season
of
waiting
anxiety
that
weighed
upon
Huck
's
spirits
like
a
*NL*
mountain
.
He
began
to
wish
he
could
see
a
flash
from
the
lantern
--
it
*NL*
would
frighten
him
,
but
it
would
at
least
tell
him
that
Tom
was
alive
*NL*
yet
.
It
seemed
hours
since
Tom
had
disappeared
.
Surely
he
must
have
*NL*
fainted
;
maybe
he
was
dead
;
maybe
his
heart
had
burst
under
terror
and
*NL*
excitement
.
In
his
uneasiness
Huck
found
himself
drawing
closer
*NL*
and
closer
to
the
alley
;
fearing
all
sorts
of
dreadful
things
,
and
*NL*
momentarily
expecting
some
catastrophe
to
happen
that
would
take
away
*NL*
his
breath
.
There
was
not
much
to
take
away
,
for
he
seemed
only
able
to
*NL*
inhale
it
by
thimblefuls
,
and
his
heart
would
soon
wear
itself
out
,
the
*NL*
way
it
was
beating
.
Suddenly
there
was
a
flash
of
light
and
Tom
came
*NL*
tearing
by
him
:
``
Run
!
''
said
he
;
``
run
,
for
your
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
need
n't
have
repeated
it
;
once
was
enough
;
Huck
was
making
thirty
or
*NL*
forty
miles
an
hour
before
the
repetition
was
uttered
.
The
boys
never
*NL*
stopped
till
they
reached
the
shed
of
a
deserted
slaughter-house
at
the
*NL*
lower
end
of
the
village
.
Just
as
they
got
within
its
shelter
the
storm
*NL*
burst
and
the
rain
poured
down
.
As
soon
as
Tom
got
his
breath
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
,
it
was
awful
!
I
tried
two
of
the
keys
,
just
as
soft
as
I
could
;
*NL*
but
they
seemed
to
make
such
a
power
of
racket
that
I
could
n't
hardly
*NL*
get
my
breath
I
was
so
scared
.
They
would
n't
turn
in
the
lock
,
either
.
*NL*
Well
,
without
noticing
what
I
was
doing
,
I
took
hold
of
the
knob
,
and
*NL*
open
comes
the
door
!
It
war
n't
locked
!
I
hopped
in
,
and
shook
off
the
*NL*
towel
,
and
,
_
Great
Caesar
's
Ghost
!
_
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
--
what
'd
you
see
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
,
I
most
stepped
onto
Injun
Joe
's
hand
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
He
was
lying
there
,
sound
asleep
on
the
floor
,
with
his
old
patch
*NL*
on
his
eye
and
his
arms
spread
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lordy
,
what
did
you
do
?
Did
he
wake
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
never
budged
.
Drunk
,
I
reckon
.
I
just
grabbed
that
towel
and
*NL*
started
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
never
`
a
'
thought
of
the
towel
,
I
bet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
would
.
My
aunt
would
make
me
mighty
sick
if
I
lost
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Tom
,
did
you
see
that
box
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
,
I
did
n't
wait
to
look
around
.
I
did
n't
see
the
box
,
I
did
n't
see
*NL*
the
cross
.
I
did
n't
see
anything
but
a
bottle
and
a
tin
cup
on
the
floor
*NL*
by
Injun
Joe
;
yes
,
I
saw
two
barrels
and
lots
more
bottles
in
the
room
.
*NL*
Do
n't
you
see
,
now
,
what
's
the
matter
with
that
ha
`

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
ha
`
nted
with
whiskey
!
Maybe
_
all
_
the
Temperance
Taverns
have
*NL*
got
a
ha
`
nted
room
,
hey
,
Huck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
reckon
maybe
that
's
so
.
Who
'd
`
a
'
thought
such
a
thing
?
But
*NL*
say
,
Tom
,
now
's
a
mighty
good
time
to
get
that
box
,
if
Injun
Joe
's
*NL*
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
that
!
You
try
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
no
--
I
reckon
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
reckon
not
,
Huck
.
Only
one
bottle
alongside
of
Injun
Joe
ai
n't
*NL*
enough

If
there
'd
been
three
,
he
'd
be
drunk
enough
and
I
'd
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
pause
for
reflection
,
and
then
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lookyhere
,
Huck
,
less
not
try
that
thing
any
more
till
we
know
Injun

It
's
too
scary

Now
,
if
we
watch
every
night
,
we
'll
*NL*
be
dead
sure
to
see
him
go
out

some
time

then
we
'll

snatch
that

quicker

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
THE
first
thing
Tom
heard
on
Friday
morning
was
a
glad
piece
of
*NL*
news
--
Judge
Thatcher
's
family
had
come
back
to
town
the
night
before
.
*NL*
Both
Injun
Joe
and
the
treasure
sunk
into
secondary
importance
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
Becky
took
the
chief
place
in
the
boy
's
interest
.
He
saw
her
*NL*
and
they
had
an
exhausting
good
time
playing
``
hispy
''
and
``
gully-keeper
''
*NL*
with
a
crowd
of
their
schoolmates
.
The
day
was
completed
and
crowned
in
*NL*
a
peculiarly
satisfactory
way
:
Becky
teased
her
mother
to
appoint
*NL*
the
next
day
for
the
long-promised
and
long-delayed
picnic
,
and
she
*NL*
consented
.
The
child
's
delight
was
boundless
;
and
Tom
's
not
more
*NL*
moderate
.
The
invitations
were
sent
out
before
sunset
,
and
straightway
*NL*
the
young
folks
of
the
village
were
thrown
into
a
fever
of
preparation
*NL*
and
pleasurable
anticipation
.
Tom
's
excitement
enabled
him
to
keep
*NL*
awake
until
a
pretty
late
hour
,
and
he
had
good
hopes
of
hearing
Huck
's
*NL*
``
maow
,
''
and
of
having
his
treasure
to
astonish
Becky
and
the
picnickers
*NL*
with
,
next
day
;
but
he
was
disappointed
.
No
signal
came
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Morning
came
,
eventually
,
and
by
ten
or
eleven
o'clock
a
giddy
and
*NL*
rollicking
company
were
gathered
at
Judge
Thatcher
's
,
and
everything
was
*NL*
ready
for
a
start
.
It
was
not
the
custom
for
elderly
people
to
mar
the
*NL*
picnics
with
their
presence
.
The
children
were
considered
safe
enough
*NL*
under
the
wings
of
a
few
young
ladies
of
eighteen
and
a
few
young
*NL*
gentlemen
of
twenty-three
or
thereabouts
.
The
old
steam
ferry-boat
was
*NL*
chartered
for
the
occasion
;
presently
the
gay
throng
filed
up
the
main
*NL*
street
laden
with
provision-baskets
.
Sid
was
sick
and
had
to
miss
*NL*
the
fun
;
Mary
remained
at
home
to
entertain
him
.
The
last
thing
Mrs.
*NL*
Thatcher
said
to
Becky
,
was
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
not
get
back
till
late
.
Perhaps
you
'd
better
stay
all
night
with
*NL*
some
of
the
girls
that
live
near
the
ferry-landing
,
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
stay
with
Susy
Harper
,
mamma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
And
mind
and
behave
yourself
and
do
n't
be
any
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
as
they
tripped
along
,
Tom
said
to
Becky
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
--
I
'll
tell
you
what
we
'll
do
.
`
Stead
of
going
to
Joe
Harper
's
we
'll
*NL*
climb
right
up
the
hill
and
stop
at
the
Widow
Douglas
'
.
She
'll
have
*NL*
ice-cream
!
She
has
it
most
every
day
--
dead
loads
of
it
.
And
she
'll
be
*NL*
awful
glad
to
have
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
will
be
fun
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Becky
reflected
a
moment
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
will
mamma
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
'll
she
ever
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
turned
the
idea
over
in
her
mind
,
and
said
reluctantly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
it
's
wrong
--
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
shucks
!
Your
mother
wo
n't
know
,
and
so
what
's
the
harm
?
All
she
*NL*
wants
is
that
you
'll
be
safe
;
and
I
bet
you
she
'd
`
a
'
said
go
there
if
*NL*
she
'd
`
a
'
thought
of
it
.
I
know
she
would
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Widow
Douglas
'
splendid
hospitality
was
a
tempting
bait
.
It
and
*NL*
Tom
's
persuasions
presently
carried
the
day
.
So
it
was
decided
to
say
*NL*
nothing
to
anybody
about
the
night
's
programme
.
Presently
it
occurred
to
*NL*
Tom
that
maybe
Huck
might
come
this
very
night
and
give
the
signal
.
The
*NL*
thought
took
a
deal
of
the
spirit
out
of
his
anticipations
.
Still
he
*NL*
could
not
bear
to
give
up
the
fun
at
Widow
Douglas
'
.
And
why
should
he
*NL*
give
it
up
,
he
reasoned
--
the
signal
did
not
come
the
night
before
,
so
*NL*
why
should
it
be
any
more
likely
to
come
tonight
?
The
sure
fun
of
the
*NL*
evening
outweighed
the
uncertain
treasure
;
and
,
boy-like
,
he
determined
*NL*
to
yield
to
the
stronger
inclination
and
not
allow
himself
to
think
of
*NL*
the
box
of
money
another
time
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
miles
below
town
the
ferryboat
stopped
at
the
mouth
of
a
woody
*NL*
hollow
and
tied
up
.
The
crowd
swarmed
ashore
and
soon
the
forest
*NL*
distances
and
craggy
heights
echoed
far
and
near
with
shoutings
and
*NL*
laughter
.
All
the
different
ways
of
getting
hot
and
tired
were
gone
*NL*
through
with
,
and
by-and-by
the
rovers
straggled
back
to
camp
fortified
*NL*
with
responsible
appetites
,
and
then
the
destruction
of
the
good
things
*NL*
began
.
After
the
feast
there
was
a
refreshing
season
of
rest
and
chat
in
*NL*
the
shade
of
spreading
oaks
.
By-and-by
somebody
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
ready
for
the
cave
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
was
.
Bundles
of
candles
were
procured
,
and
straightway
there
*NL*
was
a
general
scamper
up
the
hill
.
The
mouth
of
the
cave
was
up
the
*NL*
hillside
--
an
opening
shaped
like
a
letter
A.
Its
massive
oaken
door
stood
*NL*
unbarred
.
Within
was
a
small
chamber
,
chilly
as
an
icehouse
,
and
walled
*NL*
by
Nature
with
solid
limestone
that
was
dewy
with
a
cold
sweat
.
It
was
*NL*
romantic
and
mysterious
to
stand
here
in
the
deep
gloom
and
look
out
*NL*
upon
the
green
valley
shining
in
the
sun
.
But
the
impressiveness
of
the
*NL*
situation
quickly
wore
off
,
and
the
romping
began
again
.
The
moment
*NL*
a
candle
was
lighted
there
was
a
general
rush
upon
the
owner
of
it
;
a
*NL*
struggle
and
a
gallant
defence
followed
,
but
the
candle
was
soon
knocked
*NL*
down
or
blown
out
,
and
then
there
was
a
glad
clamor
of
laughter
and
a
*NL*
new
chase
.
But
all
things
have
an
end
.
By-and-by
the
procession
went
*NL*
filing
down
the
steep
descent
of
the
main
avenue
,
the
flickering
rank
of
*NL*
lights
dimly
revealing
the
lofty
walls
of
rock
almost
to
their
point
of
*NL*
junction
sixty
feet
overhead
.
This
main
avenue
was
not
more
than
*NL*
eight
or
ten
feet
wide
.
Every
few
steps
other
lofty
and
still
narrower
*NL*
crevices
branched
from
it
on
either
hand
--
for
McDougal
's
cave
was
but
a
*NL*
vast
labyrinth
of
crooked
aisles
that
ran
into
each
other
and
out
again
*NL*
and
led
nowhere
.
It
was
said
that
one
might
wander
days
and
nights
*NL*
together
through
its
intricate
tangle
of
rifts
and
chasms
,
and
never
*NL*
find
the
end
of
the
cave
;
and
that
he
might
go
down
,
and
down
,
and
*NL*
still
down
,
into
the
earth
,
and
it
was
just
the
same
--
labyrinth
under
*NL*
labyrinth
,
and
no
end
to
any
of
them
.
No
man
``
knew
''
the
cave
.
That
was
*NL*
an
impossible
thing
.
Most
of
the
young
men
knew
a
portion
of
it
,
and
it
*NL*
was
not
customary
to
venture
much
beyond
this
known
portion
.
Tom
Sawyer
*NL*
knew
as
much
of
the
cave
as
any
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
procession
moved
along
the
main
avenue
some
three-quarters
of
*NL*
a
mile
,
and
then
groups
and
couples
began
to
slip
aside
into
branch
*NL*
avenues
,
fly
along
the
dismal
corridors
,
and
take
each
other
by
surprise
*NL*
at
points
where
the
corridors
joined
again
.
Parties
were
able
to
elude
*NL*
each
other
for
the
space
of
half
an
hour
without
going
beyond
the
*NL*
``
known
''
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
By-and-by
,
one
group
after
another
came
straggling
back
to
the
mouth
*NL*
of
the
cave
,
panting
,
hilarious
,
smeared
from
head
to
foot
with
tallow
*NL*
drippings
,
daubed
with
clay
,
and
entirely
delighted
with
the
success
of
*NL*
the
day
.
Then
they
were
astonished
to
find
that
they
had
been
taking
*NL*
no
note
of
time
and
that
night
was
about
at
hand
.
The
clanging
bell
had
*NL*
been
calling
for
half
an
hour
.
However
,
this
sort
of
close
to
the
day
's
*NL*
adventures
was
romantic
and
therefore
satisfactory
.
When
the
ferryboat
*NL*
with
her
wild
freight
pushed
into
the
stream
,
nobody
cared
sixpence
for
*NL*
the
wasted
time
but
the
captain
of
the
craft
.
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
was
already
upon
his
watch
when
the
ferryboat
's
lights
went
*NL*
glinting
past
the
wharf
.
He
heard
no
noise
on
board
,
for
the
young
*NL*
people
were
as
subdued
and
still
as
people
usually
are
who
are
nearly
*NL*
tired
to
death
.
He
wondered
what
boat
it
was
,
and
why
she
did
not
*NL*
stop
at
the
wharf
--
and
then
he
dropped
her
out
of
his
mind
and
put
his
*NL*
attention
upon
his
business
.
The
night
was
growing
cloudy
and
dark
.
Ten
*NL*
o'clock
came
,
and
the
noise
of
vehicles
ceased
,
scattered
lights
began
*NL*
to
wink
out
,
all
straggling
foot-passengers
disappeared
,
the
village
*NL*
betook
itself
to
its
slumbers
and
left
the
small
watcher
alone
with
the
*NL*
silence
and
the
ghosts
.
Eleven
o'clock
came
,
and
the
tavern
lights
were
*NL*
put
out
;
darkness
everywhere
,
now
.
Huck
waited
what
seemed
a
weary
long
*NL*
time
,
but
nothing
happened
.
His
faith
was
weakening
.
Was
there
any
use
?
*NL*
Was
there
really
any
use
?
Why
not
give
it
up
and
turn
in
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
noise
fell
upon
his
ear
.
He
was
all
attention
in
an
instant
.
The
alley
*NL*
door
closed
softly
.
He
sprang
to
the
corner
of
the
brick
store
.
The
next
*NL*
moment
two
men
brushed
by
him
,
and
one
seemed
to
have
something
under
*NL*
his
arm
.
It
must
be
that
box
!
So
they
were
going
to
remove
the
treasure
.
*NL*
Why
call
Tom
now
?
It
would
be
absurd
--
the
men
would
get
away
with
the
box
*NL*
and
never
be
found
again
.
No
,
he
would
stick
to
their
wake
and
follow
*NL*
them
;
he
would
trust
to
the
darkness
for
security
from
discovery
.
So
*NL*
communing
with
himself
,
Huck
stepped
out
and
glided
along
behind
the
*NL*
men
,
cat-like
,
with
bare
feet
,
allowing
them
to
keep
just
far
enough
*NL*
ahead
not
to
be
invisible
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
moved
up
the
river
street
three
blocks
,
then
turned
to
the
left
up
*NL*
a
crossstreet
.
They
went
straight
ahead
,
then
,
until
they
came
to
the
*NL*
path
that
led
up
Cardiff
Hill
;
this
they
took
.
They
passed
by
the
old
*NL*
Welshman
's
house
,
halfway
up
the
hill
,
without
hesitating
,
and
still
*NL*
climbed
upward
.
Good
,
thought
Huck
,
they
will
bury
it
in
the
old
quarry
.
*NL*
But
they
never
stopped
at
the
quarry
.
They
passed
on
,
up
the
summit
.
*NL*
They
plunged
into
the
narrow
path
between
the
tall
sumach
bushes
,
and
*NL*
were
at
once
hidden
in
the
gloom
.
Huck
closed
up
and
shortened
his
*NL*
distance
,
now
,
for
they
would
never
be
able
to
see
him
.
He
trotted
along
*NL*
awhile
;
then
slackened
his
pace
,
fearing
he
was
gaining
too
fast
;
moved
*NL*
on
a
piece
,
then
stopped
altogether
;
listened
;
no
sound
;
none
,
save
that
*NL*
he
seemed
to
hear
the
beating
of
his
own
heart
.
The
hooting
of
an
*NL*
owl
came
over
the
hill
--
ominous
sound
!
But
no
footsteps
.
Heavens
,
was
*NL*
everything
lost
!
He
was
about
to
spring
with
winged
feet
,
when
a
man
*NL*
cleared
his
throat
not
four
feet
from
him
!
Huck
's
heart
shot
into
his
*NL*
throat
,
but
he
swallowed
it
again
;
and
then
he
stood
there
shaking
as
*NL*
if
a
dozen
agues
had
taken
charge
of
him
at
once
,
and
so
weak
that
he
*NL*
thought
he
must
surely
fall
to
the
ground
.
He
knew
where
he
was
.
He
*NL*
knew
he
was
within
five
steps
of
the
stile
leading
into
Widow
Douglas
'
*NL*
grounds
.
Very
well
,
he
thought
,
let
them
bury
it
there
;
it
wo
n't
be
hard
*NL*
to
find
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
there
was
a
voice
--
a
very
low
voice
--
Injun
Joe
's
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
her
,
maybe
she
's
got
company
--
there
's
lights
,
late
as
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
see
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
that
stranger
's
voice
--
the
stranger
of
the
haunted
house
.
A
*NL*
deadly
chill
went
to
Huck
's
heart
--
this
,
then
,
was
the
``
revenge
''
job
!
His
*NL*
thought
was
,
to
fly
.
Then
he
remembered
that
the
Widow
Douglas
had
been
*NL*
kind
to
him
more
than
once
,
and
maybe
these
men
were
going
to
murder
*NL*
her
.
He
wished
he
dared
venture
to
warn
her
;
but
he
knew
he
did
n't
*NL*
dare
--
they
might
come
and
catch
him
.
He
thought
all
this
and
more
in
*NL*
the
moment
that
elapsed
between
the
stranger
's
remark
and
Injun
Joe
's
*NL*
next
--
which
was
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
the
bush
is
in
your
way
.
Now

this
way
--
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Well

there
_

I

Better

up

*NL*
*NL*
``

I

*NL*
before
,
I
do
n't

for

may
have

But
her

was
*NL*
rough
on
me
--
many
times
he
was
rough
on

and
mainly
he
was
the
justice

And
that

Do

*NL*

anything
about

I

not

''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
felt
that
a
silence
was
going
to
ensue
--
a
thing
still
more
awful
*NL*
than
any
amount
of
murderous
talk
;
so
he
held
his
breath
and
stepped
*NL*
gingerly
back
;
planted
his
foot
carefully
and
firmly
,
after
balancing
,
*NL*
one-legged
,
in
a
precarious
way
and
almost
toppling
over
,
first
on
one
*NL*
side
and
then
on
the
other
.
He
took
another
step
back
,
with
the
same
*NL*
elaboration
and
the
same
risks
;
then
another
and
another
,
and
--
a
twig
*NL*
snapped
under
his
foot
!
His
breath
stopped
and
he
listened
.
There
was
no
*NL*
sound
--
the
stillness
was
perfect
.
His
gratitude
was
measureless
.
Now
he
*NL*
turned
in
his
tracks
,
between
the
walls
of
sumach
bushes
--
turned
*NL*
himself
as
carefully
as
if
he
were
a
ship
--
and
then
stepped
quickly
but
*NL*
cautiously
along
.
When
he
emerged
at
the
quarry
he
felt
secure
,
and
*NL*
so
he
picked
up
his
nimble
heels
and
flew
.
Down
,
down
he
sped
,
till
he
*NL*
reached
the
Welshman
's
.
He
banged
at
the
door
,
and
presently
the
heads
*NL*
of
the
old
man
and
his
two
stalwart
sons
were
thrust
from
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
row
there

Who
's

What
do
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Huckleberry

But
let
him
in
,

,
and
let

see
what
's
the
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
ever
tell
I
told
you
,
''
were
Huck
's
first
words
when
he
got
*NL*
in
.
``
Please
do
n't
--
I
'd
be
killed

sure
--
but
the
widow
's
been
good
friends
*NL*
to
me
sometimes
,
and
I

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
By

got
something
to

or
he
would

*NL*
exclaimed
the
old
man
;
``
out
with
it
and
nobody
here
'll
ever
tell

lad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Three
minutes
later
the
old
man
and
his
sons
,
well
armed
,
were
up
the
*NL*
hill
,
and
just
entering
the
sumach
path
on
tiptoe
,
their
weapons
in
*NL*
their
hands
.
Huck
accompanied
them
no
further
.
He
hid
behind
a
great
*NL*
bowlder
and
fell
to
listening
.
There
was
a
lagging
,
anxious
silence
,
and
*NL*
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
an
explosion
of
firearms
and
a
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
waited
for
no
particulars
.
He
sprang
away
and
sped
down
the
hill
as
*NL*
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
.

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
AS
the
earliest
suspicion
of
dawn
appeared
on
Sunday
morning
,
Huck
came
*NL*
groping
up
the
hill
and
rapped
gently
at
the
old
Welshman
's
door
.
The
*NL*
inmates
were
asleep
,
but
it
was
a
sleep
that
was
set
on
a
hair-trigger
,
*NL*
on
account
of
the
exciting
episode
of
the
night
.
A
call
came
from
a
*NL*
window
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
's
scared
voice
answered
in
a
low
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
let
me
in
!
It
's
only
Huck
Finn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
name
that
can
open
this
door
night
or
day
,
lad
!
--
and
welcome
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
strange
words
to
the
vagabond
boy
's
ears
,
and
the
pleasantest
*NL*
he
had
ever
heard
.
He
could
not
recollect
that
the
closing
word
had
ever
*NL*
been
applied
in
his
case
before
.
The
door
was
quickly
unlocked
,
and
he
*NL*
entered
.
Huck
was
given
a
seat
and
the
old
man
and
his
brace
of
tall
*NL*
sons
speedily
dressed
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
boy
,
I
hope
you
're
good
and
hungry
,
because
breakfast
will
be
*NL*
ready
as
soon
as
the
sun
's
up
,
and
we
'll
have
a
piping
hot
one
,
too
--
make
*NL*
yourself
easy
about
that
!
I
and
the
boys
hoped
you
'd
turn
up
and
stop
*NL*
here
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
awful
scared
,
''
said
Huck
,
``
and
I
run
.
I
took
out
when
the
pistols
*NL*
went
off
,
and
I
did
n't
stop
for
three
mile
.
I
've
come
now
becuz
I
wanted
*NL*
to
know
about
it
,
you
know
;
and
I
come
before
daylight
becuz
I
did
n't
*NL*
want
to
run
across
them
devils
,
even
if
they
was
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
poor
chap
,
you
do
look
as
if
you
'd
had
a
hard
night
of
it
--
but
*NL*
there
's
a
bed
here
for
you
when
you
've
had
your
breakfast
.
No
,
they
*NL*
ai
n't
dead
,
lad
--
we
are
sorry
enough
for
that
.
You
see
we
knew
right
*NL*
where
to
put
our
hands
on
them
,
by
your
description
;
so
we
crept
along
*NL*
on
tiptoe
till
we
got
within
fifteen
feet
of
them
--
dark
as
a
cellar
that
*NL*
sumach
path
was
--
and
just
then
I
found
I
was
going
to
sneeze
.
It
was
the
*NL*
meanest
kind
of
luck
!
I
tried
to
keep
it
back
,
but
no
use
--
't
was
bound
to
*NL*
come
,
and
it
did
come
!
I
was
in
the
lead
with
my
pistol
raised
,
and
when
*NL*
the
sneeze
started
those
scoundrels
a-rustling
to
get
out
of
the
path
,
*NL*
I
sung
out
,
`
Fire
boys
!
'
and
blazed
away
at
the
place
where
the
rustling
*NL*
was
.
So
did
the
boys
.
But
they
were
off
in
a
jiffy
,
those
villains
,
and
*NL*
we
after
them
,
down
through
the
woods
.
I
judge
we
never
touched
them
.
*NL*
They
fired
a
shot
apiece
as
they
started
,
but
their
bullets
whizzed
by
*NL*
and
did
n't
do
us
any
harm
.
As
soon
as
we
lost
the
sound
of
their
feet
*NL*
we
quit
chasing
,
and
went
down
and
stirred
up
the
constables
.
They
got
a
*NL*
posse
together
,
and
went
off
to
guard
the
river
bank
,
and
as
soon
as
it
*NL*
is
light
the
sheriff
and
a
gang
are
going
to
beat
up
the
woods
.
My
boys
*NL*
will
be
with
them
presently
.
I
wish
we
had
some
sort
of
description
of
*NL*
those
rascals
--
`
twould
help
a
good
deal
.
But
you
could
n't
see
what
they
*NL*
were
like
,
in
the
dark
,
lad
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
;
I
saw
them
downtown
and
follered
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid
!
Describe
them
--
describe
them
,
my
boy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
's
the
old
deaf
and
dumb
Spaniard
that
's
ben
around
here
once
or
*NL*
twice
,
and
t
`
other
's
a
mean-looking
,
ragged
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
,
lad
,
we
know
the
men
!
Happened
on
them
in
the
woods
back
*NL*
of
the
widow
's
one
day
,
and
they
slunk
away
.
Off
with
you
,
boys
,
and
*NL*
tell
the
sheriff
--
get
your
breakfast
tomorrow
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Welshman
's
sons
departed
at
once
.
As
they
were
leaving
the
room
Huck
*NL*
sprang
up
and
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
do
n't
tell
_
any_body
it
was
me
that
blowed
on
them
!
Oh
,
*NL*
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
if
you
say
it
,
Huck
,
but
you
ought
to
have
the
credit
of
what
*NL*
you
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
no
!
Please
do
n't
tell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
young
men
were
gone
,
the
old
Welshman
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
wo
n't
tell
--
and
I
wo
n't
.
But
why
do
n't
you
want
it
known
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
would
not
explain
,
further
than
to
say
that
he
already
knew
too
*NL*
much
about
one
of
those
men
and
would
not
have
the
man
know
that
he
knew
*NL*
anything
against
him
for
the
whole
world
--
he
would
be
killed
for
knowing
*NL*
it
,
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
promised
secrecy
once
more
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
come
to
follow
these
fellows
,
lad
?
Were
they
looking
*NL*
suspicious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
was
silent
while
he
framed
a
duly
cautious
reply
.
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
I
'm
a
kind
of
a
hard
lot
,
--
least
everybody
says
so
,
and
*NL*
I
do
n't
see
nothing
agin
it
--
and
sometimes
I
ca
n't
sleep
much
,
on
account
*NL*
of
thinking
about
it
and
sort
of
trying
to
strike
out
a
new
way
of
*NL*
doing
.
That
was
the
way
of
it
last
night
.
I
could
n't
sleep
,
and
so
I
*NL*
come
along
upstreet
`
bout
midnight
,
a-turning
it
all
over
,
and
when
I
*NL*
got
to
that
old
shackly
brick
store
by
the
Temperance
Tavern
,
I
backed
*NL*
up
agin
the
wall
to
have
another
think
.
Well
,
just
then
along
comes
*NL*
these
two
chaps
slipping
along
close
by
me
,
with
something
under
their
*NL*
arm
,
and
I
reckoned
they
'd
stole
it
.
One
was
a-smoking
,
and
t
`
other
one
*NL*
wanted
a
light
;
so
they
stopped
right
before
me
and
the
cigars
lit
up
*NL*
their
faces
and
I
see
that
the
big
one
was
the
deaf
and
dumb
Spaniard
,
*NL*
by
his
white
whiskers
and
the
patch
on
his
eye
,
and
t
`
other
one
was
a
*NL*
rusty
,
ragged-looking
devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
see
the
rags
by
the
light
of
the
cigars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
staggered
Huck
for
a
moment
.
Then
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
--
but
somehow
it
seems
as
if
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
went
on
,
and
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Follered
'em
--
yes
.
That
was
it
.
I
wanted
to
see
what
was
up
--
they
sneaked
*NL*
along
so
.
I
dogged
'em
to
the
widder
's
stile
,
and
stood
in
the
dark
and
*NL*
heard
the
ragged
one
beg
for
the
widder
,
and
the
Spaniard
swear
he
'd
*NL*
spile
her
looks
just
as
I
told
you
and
your
two
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
The
_
deaf
and
dumb
_
man
said
all
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
had
made
another
terrible
mistake
!
He
was
trying
his
best
to
keep
*NL*
the
old
man
from
getting
the
faintest
hint
of
who
the
Spaniard
might
be
,
*NL*
and
yet
his
tongue
seemed
determined
to
get
him
into
trouble
in
spite
of
*NL*
all
he
could
do
.
He
made
several
efforts
to
creep
out
of
his
scrape
,
*NL*
but
the
old
man
's
eye
was
upon
him
and
he
made
blunder
after
blunder
.
*NL*
Presently
the
Welshman
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
boy
,
do
n't
be
afraid
of
me
.
I
would
n't
hurt
a
hair
of
your
head
for
*NL*
all
the
world
.
No
--
I
'd
protect
you
--
I
'd
protect
you
.
This
Spaniard
is
*NL*
not
deaf
and
dumb
;
you
've
let
that
slip
without
intending
it
;
you
ca
n't
*NL*
cover
that
up
now
.
You
know
something
about
that
Spaniard
that
you
want
*NL*
to
keep
dark
.
Now
trust
me
--
tell
me
what
it
is
,
and
trust
me
--
I
wo
n't
*NL*
betray
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
looked
into
the
old
man
's
honest
eyes
a
moment
,
then
bent
over
and
*NL*
whispered
in
his
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Tai
n't
a
Spaniard
--
it
's
Injun
Joe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Welshman
almost
jumped
out
of
his
chair
.
In
a
moment
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
plain
enough
,
now
.
When
you
talked
about
notching
ears
and
*NL*
slitting
noses
I
judged
that
that
was
your
own
embellishment
,
because
*NL*
white
men
do
n't
take
that
sort
of
revenge
.
But
an
Injun
!
That
's
a
*NL*
different
matter
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
breakfast
the
talk
went
on
,
and
in
the
course
of
it
the
old
man
*NL*
said
that
the
last
thing
which
he
and
his
sons
had
done
,
before
going
*NL*
to
bed
,
was
to
get
a
lantern
and
examine
the
stile
and
its
vicinity
for
*NL*
marks
of
blood
.
They
found
none
,
but
captured
a
bulky
bundle
of
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
_
what
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
words
had
been
lightning
they
could
not
have
leaped
with
a
more
*NL*
stunning
suddenness
from
Huck
's
blanched
lips
.
His
eyes
were
staring
*NL*
wide
,
now
,
and
his
breath
suspended
--
waiting
for
the
answer
.
The
Welshman
*NL*
started
--
stared
in
return
--
three
seconds
--
five
seconds
--
ten
--
then
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
burglar
's
tools
.
Why
,
what
's
the
_
matter
_
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
sank
back
,
panting
gently
,
but
deeply
,
unutterably
grateful
.
The
*NL*
Welshman
eyed
him
gravely
,
curiously
--
and
presently
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
burglar
's
tools
.
That
appears
to
relieve
you
a
good
deal
.
But
what
*NL*
did
give
you
that
turn
?
What
were
_
you
_
expecting
we
'd
found
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
was
in
a
close
place
--
the
inquiring
eye
was
upon
him
--
he
would
have
*NL*
given
anything
for
material
for
a
plausible
answer
--
nothing
suggested
*NL*
itself
--
the
inquiring
eye
was
boring
deeper
and
deeper
--
a
senseless
*NL*
reply
offered
--
there
was
no
time
to
weigh
it
,
so
at
a
venture
he
uttered
*NL*
it
--
feebly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sunday-school
books
,
maybe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Huck
was
too
distressed
to
smile
,
but
the
old
man
laughed
loud
and
*NL*
joyously
,
shook
up
the
details
of
his
anatomy
from
head
to
foot
,
and
*NL*
ended
by
saying
that
such
a
laugh
was
money
in
a-man
's
pocket
,
because
*NL*
it
cut
down
the
doctor
's
bill
like
everything
.
Then
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
old
chap
,
you
're
white
and
jaded
--
you
ai
n't
well
a
bit
--
no
wonder
*NL*
you
're
a
little
flighty
and
off
your
balance
.
But
you
'll
come
out
of
it
.
*NL*
Rest
and
sleep
will
fetch
you
out
all
right
,
I
hope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
was
irritated
to
think
he
had
been
such
a
goose
and
betrayed
such
*NL*
a
suspicious
excitement
,
for
he
had
dropped
the
idea
that
the
parcel
*NL*
brought
from
the
tavern
was
the
treasure
,
as
soon
as
he
had
heard
the
*NL*
talk
at
the
widow
's
stile
.
He
had
only
thought
it
was
not
the
treasure
,
*NL*
however
--
he
had
not
known
that
it
was
n't
--
and
so
the
suggestion
of
a
*NL*
captured
bundle
was
too
much
for
his
self-possession
.
But
on
the
whole
*NL*
he
felt
glad
the
little
episode
had
happened
,
for
now
he
knew
beyond
all
*NL*
question
that
that
bundle
was
not
_
the
_
bundle
,
and
so
his
mind
was
*NL*
at
rest
and
exceedingly
comfortable
.
In
fact
,
everything
seemed
to
be
*NL*
drifting
just
in
the
right
direction
,
now
;
the
treasure
must
be
still
*NL*
in
No.
2
,
the
men
would
be
captured
and
jailed
that
day
,
and
he
and
*NL*
Tom
could
seize
the
gold
that
night
without
any
trouble
or
any
fear
of
*NL*
interruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
breakfast
was
completed
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
.
Huck
*NL*
jumped
for
a
hiding-place
,
for
he
had
no
mind
to
be
connected
even
*NL*
remotely
with
the
late
event
.
The
Welshman
admitted
several
ladies
and
*NL*
gentlemen
,
among
them
the
Widow
Douglas
,
and
noticed
that
groups
of
*NL*
citizens
were
climbing
up
the
hill
--
to
stare
at
the
stile
.
So
the
news
*NL*
had
spread
.
The
Welshman
had
to
tell
the
story
of
the
night
to
the
*NL*
visitors
.
The
widow
's
gratitude
for
her
preservation
was
outspoken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
a
word
about
it
,
madam
.
There
's
another
that
you
're
more
*NL*
beholden
to
than
you
are
to
me
and
my
boys
,
maybe
,
but
he
do
n't
allow
me
*NL*
to
tell
his
name
.
We
would
n't
have
been
there
but
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
this
excited
a
curiosity
so
vast
that
it
almost
belittled
the
*NL*
main
matter
--
but
the
Welshman
allowed
it
to
eat
into
the
vitals
of
his
*NL*
visitors
,
and
through
them
be
transmitted
to
the
whole
town
,
for
he
*NL*
refused
to
part
with
his
secret
.
When
all
else
had
been
learned
,
the
*NL*
widow
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
sleep
reading
in
bed
and
slept
straight
through
all
that
*NL*
noise
.
Why
did
n't
you
come
and
wake
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
judged
it
war
n't
worth
while
.
Those
fellows
war
n't
likely
to
come
*NL*
again
--
they
had
n't
any
tools
left
to
work
with
,
and
what
was
the
use
of
*NL*
waking
you
up
and
scaring
you
to
death
?
My
three
negro
men
stood
guard
*NL*
at
your
house
all
the
rest
of
the
night
.
They
've
just
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
More
visitors
came
,
and
the
story
had
to
be
told
and
retold
for
a
couple
*NL*
of
hours
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
Sabbath-school
during
day-school
vacation
,
but
everybody
*NL*
was
early
at
church
.
The
stirring
event
was
well
canvassed
.
News
came
*NL*
that
not
a
sign
of
the
two
villains
had
been
yet
discovered
.
When
the
*NL*
sermon
was
finished
,
Judge
Thatcher
's
wife
dropped
alongside
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Harper
as
she
moved
down
the
aisle
with
the
crowd
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
my
Becky
going
to
sleep
all
day
?
I
just
expected
she
would
be
tired
*NL*
to
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
Becky
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
with
a
startled
look
--
``
did
n't
she
stay
with
you
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Thatcher
turned
pale
,
and
sank
into
a
pew
,
just
as
Aunt
Polly
,
*NL*
talking
briskly
with
a
friend
,
passed
by
.
Aunt
Polly
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodmorning
,
Mrs.
Thatcher
.
Goodmorning
,
Mrs.
Harper
.
I
've
got
a
boy
*NL*
that
's
turned
up
missing
.
I
reckon
my
Tom
stayed
at
your
house
last
*NL*
night
--
one
of
you
.
And
now
he
's
afraid
to
come
to
church
.
I
've
got
to
*NL*
settle
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Thatcher
shook
her
head
feebly
and
turned
paler
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
n't
stay
with
us
,
''
said
Mrs.
Harper
,
beginning
to
look
uneasy
.
A
*NL*
marked
anxiety
came
into
Aunt
Polly
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joe
Harper
,
have
you
seen
my
Tom
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
'm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
did
you
see
him
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Joe
tried
to
remember
,
but
was
not
sure
he
could
say
.
The
people
had
*NL*
stopped
moving
out
of
church
.
Whispers
passed
along
,
and
a
boding
*NL*
uneasiness
took
possession
of
every
countenance
.
Children
were
anxiously
*NL*
questioned
,
and
young
teachers
.
They
all
said
they
had
not
noticed
*NL*
whether
Tom
and
Becky
were
on
board
the
ferryboat
on
the
homeward
trip
;
*NL*
it
was
dark
;
no
one
thought
of
inquiring
if
any
one
was
missing
.
One
*NL*
young
man
finally
blurted
out
his
fear
that
they
were
still
in
the
cave
!
*NL*
Mrs.
Thatcher
swooned
away
.
Aunt
Polly
fell
to
crying
and
wringing
her
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
alarm
swept
from
lip
to
lip
,
from
group
to
group
,
from
street
to
*NL*
street
,
and
within
five
minutes
the
bells
were
wildly
clanging
and
*NL*
the
whole
town
was
up
!
The
Cardiff
Hill
episode
sank
into
instant
*NL*
insignificance
,
the
burglars
were
forgotten
,
horses
were
saddled
,
skiffs
*NL*
were
manned
,
the
ferryboat
ordered
out
,
and
before
the
horror
was
half
*NL*
an
hour
old
,
two
hundred
men
were
pouring
down
highroad
and
river
toward
*NL*
the
cave
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
long
afternoon
the
village
seemed
empty
and
dead
.
Many
women
*NL*
visited
Aunt
Polly
and
Mrs.
Thatcher
and
tried
to
comfort
them
.
They
*NL*
cried
with
them
,
too
,
and
that
was
still
better
than
words
.
All
the
*NL*
tedious
night
the
town
waited
for
news
;
but
when
the
morning
dawned
at
*NL*
last
,
all
the
word
that
came
was
,
``
Send
more
candles
--
and
send
food
.
''
*NL*
Mrs.
Thatcher
was
almost
crazed
;
and
Aunt
Polly
,
also
.
Judge
Thatcher
*NL*
sent
messages
of
hope
and
encouragement
from
the
cave
,
but
they
conveyed
*NL*
no
real
cheer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
Welshman
came
home
toward
daylight
,
spattered
with
*NL*
candle-grease
,
smeared
with
clay
,
and
almost
worn
out
.
He
found
Huck
*NL*
still
in
the
bed
that
had
been
provided
for
him
,
and
delirious
with
*NL*
fever
.
The
physicians
were
all
at
the
cave
,
so
the
Widow
Douglas
came
*NL*
and
took
charge
of
the
patient
.
She
said
she
would
do
her
best
by
him
,
*NL*
because
,
whether
he
was
good
,
bad
,
or
indifferent
,
he
was
the
Lord
's
,
*NL*
and
nothing
that
was
the
Lord
's
was
a
thing
to
be
neglected
.
The
*NL*
Welshman
said
Huck
had
good
spots
in
him
,
and
the
widow
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
depend
on
it
.
That
's
the
Lord
's
mark
.
He
do
n't
leave
it
off
.
*NL*
He
never
does
.
Puts
it
somewhere
on
every
creature
that
comes
from
his
*NL*
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
forenoon
parties
of
jaded
men
began
to
straggle
into
the
*NL*
village
,
but
the
strongest
of
the
citizens
continued
searching
.
All
the
*NL*
news
that
could
be
gained
was
that
remotenesses
of
the
cavern
were
being
*NL*
ransacked
that
had
never
been
visited
before
;
that
every
corner
and
*NL*
crevice
was
going
to
be
thoroughly
searched
;
that
wherever
one
wandered
*NL*
through
the
maze
of
passages
,
lights
were
to
be
seen
flitting
hither
*NL*
and
thither
in
the
distance
,
and
shoutings
and
pistol-shots
sent
their
*NL*
hollow
reverberations
to
the
ear
down
the
sombre
aisles
.
In
one
place
,
*NL*
far
from
the
section
usually
traversed
by
tourists
,
the
names
``
BECKY
&
*NL*
TOM
''
had
been
found
traced
upon
the
rocky
wall
with
candle-smoke
,
and
*NL*
near
at
hand
a
grease-soiled
bit
of
ribbon
.
Mrs.
Thatcher
recognized
the
*NL*
ribbon
and
cried
over
it
.
She
said
it
was
the
last
relic
she
should
ever
*NL*
have
of
her
child
;
and
that
no
other
memorial
of
her
could
ever
be
so
*NL*
precious
,
because
this
one
parted
latest
from
the
living
body
before
the
*NL*
awful
death
came
.
Some
said
that
now
and
then
,
in
the
cave
,
a
far-away
*NL*
speck
of
light
would
glimmer
,
and
then
a
glorious
shout
would
burst
*NL*
forth
and
a
score
of
men
go
trooping
down
the
echoing
aisle
--
and
then
a
*NL*
sickening
disappointment
always
followed
;
the
children
were
not
there
;
*NL*
it
was
only
a
searcher
's
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
dreadful
days
and
nights
dragged
their
tedious
hours
along
,
and
*NL*
the
village
sank
into
a
hopeless
stupor
.
No
one
had
heart
for
anything
.
*NL*
The
accidental
discovery
,
just
made
,
that
the
proprietor
of
the
*NL*
Temperance
Tavern
kept
liquor
on
his
premises
,
scarcely
fluttered
the
*NL*
public
pulse
,
tremendous
as
the
fact
was
.
In
a
lucid
interval
,
Huck
*NL*
feebly
led
up
to
the
subject
of
taverns
,
and
finally
asked
--
dimly
*NL*
dreading
the
worst
--
if
anything
had
been
discovered
at
the
Temperance
*NL*
Tavern
since
he
had
been
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
widow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
started
up
in
bed
,
wildeyed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
What
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Liquor
!
--
and
the
place
has
been
shut
up
.
Lie
down
,
child
--
what
a
turn
you
*NL*
did
give
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
tell
me
just
one
thing
--
only
just
one
--
please
!
Was
it
Tom
Sawyer
*NL*
that
found
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
widow
burst
into
tears
.
``
Hush
,
hush
,
child
,
hush
!
I
've
told
you
*NL*
before
,
you
must
_
not
_
talk
.
You
are
very
,
very
sick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
nothing
but
liquor
had
been
found
;
there
would
have
been
a
great
*NL*
powwow
if
it
had
been
the
gold
.
So
the
treasure
was
gone
forever
--
gone
*NL*
forever
!
But
what
could
she
be
crying
about
?
Curious
that
she
should
*NL*
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
thoughts
worked
their
dim
way
through
Huck
's
mind
,
and
under
the
*NL*
weariness
they
gave
him
he
fell
asleep
.
The
widow
said
to
herself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
he
's
asleep
,
poor
wreck
.
Tom
Sawyer
find
it
!
Pity
but
somebody
*NL*
could
find
Tom
Sawyer
!
Ah
,
there
ai
n't
many
left
,
now
,
that
's
got
hope
*NL*
enough
,
or
strength
enough
,
either
,
to
go
on
searching
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
NOW
to
return
to
Tom
and
Becky
's
share
in
the
picnic
.
They
tripped
along
*NL*
the
murky
aisles
with
the
rest
of
the
company
,
visiting
the
familiar
*NL*
wonders
of
the
cave
--
wonders
dubbed
with
rather
over-descriptive
names
,
*NL*
such
as
``
The
Drawing-Room
,
''
``
The
Cathedral
,
''
``
Aladdin
's
Palace
,
''
and
*NL*
so
on
.
Presently
the
hide-and-seek
frolicking
began
,
and
Tom
and
Becky
*NL*
engaged
in
it
with
zeal
until
the
exertion
began
to
grow
a
trifle
*NL*
wearisome
;
then
they
wandered
down
a
sinuous
avenue
holding
their
*NL*
candles
aloft
and
reading
the
tangled
webwork
of
names
,
dates
,
*NL*
postoffice
addresses
,
and
mottoes
with
which
the
rocky
walls
had
been
*NL*
frescoed
-LRB-
in
candle-smoke
-RRB-
.
Still
drifting
along
and
talking
,
they
*NL*
scarcely
noticed
that
they
were
now
in
a
part
of
the
cave
whose
walls
*NL*
were
not
frescoed
.
They
smoked
their
own
names
under
an
overhanging
*NL*
shelf
and
moved
on
.
Presently
they
came
to
a
place
where
a
little
stream
*NL*
of
water
,
trickling
over
a
ledge
and
carrying
a
limestone
sediment
with
*NL*
it
,
had
,
in
the
slow-dragging
ages
,
formed
a
laced
and
ruffled
Niagara
*NL*
in
gleaming
and
imperishable
stone
.
Tom
squeezed
his
small
body
behind
*NL*
it
in
order
to
illuminate
it
for
Becky
's
gratification
.
He
found
that
*NL*
it
curtained
a
sort
of
steep
natural
stairway
which
was
enclosed
between
*NL*
narrow
walls
,
and
at
once
the
ambition
to
be
a
discoverer
seized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Becky
responded
to
his
call
,
and
they
made
a
smoke-mark
for
future
*NL*
guidance
,
and
started
upon
their
quest
.
They
wound
this
way
and
that
,
*NL*
far
down
into
the
secret
depths
of
the
cave
,
made
another
mark
,
and
*NL*
branched
off
in
search
of
novelties
to
tell
the
upper
world
about
.
In
*NL*
one
place
they
found
a
spacious
cavern
,
from
whose
ceiling
depended
a
*NL*
multitude
of
shining
stalactites
of
the
length
and
circumference
of
*NL*
a
man
's
leg
;
they
walked
all
about
it
,
wondering
and
admiring
,
and
*NL*
presently
left
it
by
one
of
the
numerous
passages
that
opened
into
*NL*
it
.
This
shortly
brought
them
to
a
bewitching
spring
,
whose
basin
was
*NL*
incrusted
with
a
frostwork
of
glittering
crystals
;
it
was
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
a
cavern
whose
walls
were
supported
by
many
fantastic
pillars
which
*NL*
had
been
formed
by
the
joining
of
great
stalactites
and
stalagmites
*NL*
together
,
the
result
of
the
ceaseless
water-drip
of
centuries
.
Under
the
*NL*
roof
vast
knots
of
bats
had
packed
themselves
together
,
thousands
in
a
*NL*
bunch
;
the
lights
disturbed
the
creatures
and
they
came
flocking
down
by
*NL*
hundreds
,
squeaking
and
darting
furiously
at
the
candles
.
Tom
knew
their
*NL*
ways
and
the
danger
of
this
sort
of
conduct
.
He
seized
Becky
's
hand
and
*NL*
hurried
her
into
the
first
corridor
that
offered
;
and
none
too
soon
,
for
*NL*
a
bat
struck
Becky
's
light
out
with
its
wing
while
she
was
passing
out
*NL*
of
the
cavern
.
The
bats
chased
the
children
a
good
distance
;
but
the
*NL*
fugitives
plunged
into
every
new
passage
that
offered
,
and
at
last
got
*NL*
rid
of
the
perilous
things
.
Tom
found
a
subterranean
lake
,
shortly
,
*NL*
which
stretched
its
dim
length
away
until
its
shape
was
lost
in
the
*NL*
shadows
.
He
wanted
to
explore
its
borders
,
but
concluded
that
it
would
*NL*
be
best
to
sit
down
and
rest
awhile
,
first
.
Now
,
for
the
first
time
,
the
*NL*
deep
stillness
of
the
place
laid
a
clammy
hand
upon
the
spirits
of
the
*NL*
children
.
Becky
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
did
n't
notice
,
but
it
seems
ever
so
long
since
I
heard
any
of
*NL*
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
think
,
Becky
,
we
are
away
down
below
them
--
and
I
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
far
away
north
,
or
south
,
or
east
,
or
whichever
it
is
.
We
could
n't
hear
*NL*
them
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Becky
grew
apprehensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
how
long
we
've
been
down
here
,
Tom
?
We
better
start
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
reckon
we
better
.
P'raps
we
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
find
the
way
,
Tom
?
It
's
all
a
mixed-up
crookedness
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
I
could
find
it
--
but
then
the
bats
.
If
they
put
our
candles
*NL*
out
it
will
be
an
awful
fix
.
Let
's
try
some
other
way
,
so
as
not
to
go
*NL*
through
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
.
But
I
hope
we
wo
n't
get
lost
.
It
would
be
so
awful
!
''
and
the
girl
*NL*
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
the
dreadful
possibilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
started
through
a
corridor
,
and
traversed
it
in
silence
a
long
*NL*
way
,
glancing
at
each
new
opening
,
to
see
if
there
was
anything
familiar
*NL*
about
the
look
of
it
;
but
they
were
all
strange
.
Every
time
Tom
made
an
*NL*
examination
,
Becky
would
watch
his
face
for
an
encouraging
sign
,
and
he
*NL*
would
say
cheerily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
all
right
.
This
ai
n't
the
one
,
but
we
'll
come
to
it
right
*NL*
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
felt
less
and
less
hopeful
with
each
failure
,
and
presently
began
*NL*
to
turn
off
into
diverging
avenues
at
sheer
random
,
in
desperate
hope
of
*NL*
finding
the
one
that
was
wanted
.
He
still
said
it
was
``
all
right
,
''
but
*NL*
there
was
such
a
leaden
dread
at
his
heart
that
the
words
had
lost
their
*NL*
ring
and
sounded
just
as
if
he
had
said
,
``
All
is
lost
!
''
Becky
clung
to
*NL*
his
side
in
an
anguish
of
fear
,
and
tried
hard
to
keep
back
the
tears
,
*NL*
but
they
would
come
.
At
last
she
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
never
mind
the
bats
,
let
's
go
back
that
way
!
We
seem
to
get
*NL*
worse
and
worse
off
all
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Profound
silence
;
silence
so
deep
that
even
their
breathings
were
*NL*
conspicuous
in
the
hush
.
Tom
shouted
.
The
call
went
echoing
down
*NL*
the
empty
aisles
and
died
out
in
the
distance
in
a
faint
sound
that
*NL*
resembled
a
ripple
of
mocking
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
do
it
again
,
Tom
,
it
is
too
horrid
,
''
said
Becky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
horrid
,
but
I
better
,
Becky
;
they
might
hear
us
,
you
know
,
''
and
*NL*
he
shouted
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
might
''
was
even
a
chillier
horror
than
the
ghostly
laughter
,
it
so
*NL*
confessed
a
perishing
hope
.
The
children
stood
still
and
listened
;
but
*NL*
there
was
no
result
.
Tom
turned
upon
the
back
track
at
once
,
and
hurried
*NL*
his
steps
.
It
was
but
a
little
while
before
a
certain
indecision
in
his
*NL*
manner
revealed
another
fearful
fact
to
Becky
--
he
could
not
find
his
way
*NL*
back
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Tom
,
you
did
n't
make
any
marks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Becky
,
I
was
such
a
fool
!
Such
a
fool
!
I
never
thought
we
might
want
to
*NL*
come
back
!
No
--
I
ca
n't
find
the
way
.
It
's
all
mixed
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
Tom
,
we
're
lost
!
we
're
lost
!
We
never
can
get
out
of
this
awful
*NL*
place
!
Oh
,
why
_
did
_
we
ever
leave
the
others
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sank
to
the
ground
and
burst
into
such
a
frenzy
of
crying
that
Tom
*NL*
was
appalled
with
the
idea
that
she
might
die
,
or
lose
her
reason
.
He
*NL*
sat
down
by
her
and
put
his
arms
around
her
;
she
buried
her
face
in
*NL*
his
bosom
,
she
clung
to
him
,
she
poured
out
her
terrors
,
her
unavailing
*NL*
regrets
,
and
the
far
echoes
turned
them
all
to
jeering
laughter
.
Tom
*NL*
begged
her
to
pluck
up
hope
again
,
and
she
said
she
could
not
.
He
fell
*NL*
to
blaming
and
abusing
himself
for
getting
her
into
this
miserable
*NL*
situation
;
this
had
a
better
effect
.
She
said
she
would
try
to
hope
*NL*
again
,
she
would
get
up
and
follow
wherever
he
might
lead
if
only
he
*NL*
would
not
talk
like
that
any
more
.
For
he
was
no
more
to
blame
than
she
,
*NL*
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
they
moved
on
again
--
aimlessly
--
simply
at
random
--
all
they
could
do
*NL*
was
to
move
,
keep
moving
.
For
a
little
while
,
hope
made
a
show
of
*NL*
reviving
--
not
with
any
reason
to
back
it
,
but
only
because
it
is
its
*NL*
nature
to
revive
when
the
spring
has
not
been
taken
out
of
it
by
age
and
*NL*
familiarity
with
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
By-and-by
Tom
took
Becky
's
candle
and
blew
it
out
.
This
economy
meant
so
*NL*
much
!
Words
were
not
needed
.
Becky
understood
,
and
her
hope
died
again
.
*NL*
She
knew
that
Tom
had
a
whole
candle
and
three
or
four
pieces
in
his
*NL*
pockets
--
yet
he
must
economize
.
*NL*
*NL*
By-and-by
,
fatigue
began
to
assert
its
claims
;
the
children
tried
to
pay
*NL*
attention
,
for
it
was
dreadful
to
think
of
sitting
down
when
time
was
*NL*
grown
to
be
so
precious
,
moving
,
in
some
direction
,
in
any
direction
,
*NL*
was
at
least
progress
and
might
bear
fruit
;
but
to
sit
down
was
to
*NL*
invite
death
and
shorten
its
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Becky
's
frail
limbs
refused
to
carry
her
farther
.
She
sat
down
.
*NL*
Tom
rested
with
her
,
and
they
talked
of
home
,
and
the
friends
there
,
*NL*
and
the
comfortable
beds
and
,
above
all
,
the
light
!
Becky
cried
,
and
Tom
*NL*
tried
to
think
of
some
way
of
comforting
her
,
but
all
his
encouragements
*NL*
were
grown
thread-bare
with
use
,
and
sounded
like
sarcasms
.
Fatigue
bore
*NL*
so
heavily
upon
Becky
that
she
drowsed
off
to
sleep
.
Tom
was
grateful
.
*NL*
He
sat
looking
into
her
drawn
face
and
saw
it
grow
smooth
and
natural
*NL*
under
the
influence
of
pleasant
dreams
;
and
by-and-by
a
smile
dawned
and
*NL*
rested
there
.
The
peaceful
face
reflected
somewhat
of
peace
and
healing
*NL*
into
his
own
spirit
,
and
his
thoughts
wandered
away
to
bygone
times
and
*NL*
dreamy
memories
.
While
he
was
deep
in
his
musings
,
Becky
woke
up
with
a
*NL*
breezy
little
laugh
--
but
it
was
stricken
dead
upon
her
lips
,
and
a
groan
*NL*
followed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
_
could
_
I
sleep
!
I
wish
I
never
,
never
had
waked
!
No
!
No
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
,
Tom
!
Do
n't
look
so
!
I
wo
n't
say
it
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
've
slept
,
Becky
;
you
'll
feel
rested
,
now
,
and
we
'll
find
*NL*
the
way
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
can
try
,
Tom
;
but
I
've
seen
such
a
beautiful
country
in
my
dream
.
I
*NL*
reckon
we
are
going
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
not
,
maybe
not
.
Cheer
up
,
Becky
,
and
let
's
go
on
trying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rose
up
and
wandered
along
,
hand
in
hand
and
hopeless
.
They
tried
*NL*
to
estimate
how
long
they
had
been
in
the
cave
,
but
all
they
knew
was
*NL*
that
it
seemed
days
and
weeks
,
and
yet
it
was
plain
that
this
could
not
*NL*
be
,
for
their
candles
were
not
gone
yet
.
A
long
time
after
this
--
they
*NL*
could
not
tell
how
long
--
Tom
said
they
must
go
softly
and
listen
for
*NL*
dripping
water
--
they
must
find
a
spring
.
They
found
one
presently
,
and
*NL*
Tom
said
it
was
time
to
rest
again
.
Both
were
cruelly
tired
,
yet
Becky
*NL*
said
she
thought
she
could
go
a
little
farther
.
She
was
surprised
to
*NL*
hear
Tom
dissent
.
She
could
not
understand
it
.
They
sat
down
,
and
Tom
*NL*
fastened
his
candle
to
the
wall
in
front
of
them
with
some
clay
.
Thought
*NL*
was
soon
busy
;
nothing
was
said
for
some
time
.
Then
Becky
broke
the
*NL*
silence
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
I
am
so
hungry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
took
something
out
of
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
this
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Becky
almost
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
our
wedding-cake
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
wish
it
was
as
big
as
a
barrel
,
for
it
's
all
we
've
got
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saved
it
from
the
picnic
for
us
to
dream
on
,
Tom
,
the
way
grownup
*NL*
people
do
with
wedding-cake
--
but
it
'll
be
our
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
the
sentence
where
it
was
.
Tom
divided
the
cake
and
Becky
*NL*
ate
with
good
appetite
,
while
Tom
nibbled
at
his
moiety
.
There
was
*NL*
abundance
of
cold
water
to
finish
the
feast
with
.
By-and-by
Becky
*NL*
suggested
that
they
move
on
again
.
Tom
was
silent
a
moment
.
Then
he
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Becky
,
can
you
bear
it
if
I
tell
you
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Becky
's
face
paled
,
but
she
thought
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
Becky
,
we
must
stay
here
,
where
there
's
water
to
drink
.
*NL*
That
little
piece
is
our
last
candle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Becky
gave
loose
to
tears
and
wailings
.
Tom
did
what
he
could
to
comfort
*NL*
her
,
but
with
little
effect
.
At
length
Becky
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Becky
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
miss
us
and
hunt
for
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
will
!
Certainly
they
will
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
they
're
hunting
for
us
now
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
reckon
maybe
they
are
.
I
hope
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
would
they
miss
us
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
they
get
back
to
the
boat
,
I
reckon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
it
might
be
dark
then
--
would
they
notice
we
had
n't
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
But
anyway
,
your
mother
would
miss
you
as
soon
as
they
*NL*
got
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
frightened
look
in
Becky
's
face
brought
Tom
to
his
senses
and
he
saw
*NL*
that
he
had
made
a
blunder
.
Becky
was
not
to
have
gone
home
that
night
!
*NL*
The
children
became
silent
and
thoughtful
.
In
a
moment
a
new
burst
of
*NL*
grief
from
Becky
showed
Tom
that
the
thing
in
his
mind
had
struck
hers
*NL*
also
--
that
the
Sabbath
morning
might
be
half
spent
before
Mrs.
Thatcher
*NL*
discovered
that
Becky
was
not
at
Mrs.
Harper
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
fastened
their
eyes
upon
their
bit
of
candle
and
watched
it
*NL*
melt
slowly
and
pitilessly
away
;
saw
the
half
inch
of
wick
stand
alone
*NL*
at
last
;
saw
the
feeble
flame
rise
and
fall
,
climb
the
thin
column
of
*NL*
smoke
,
linger
at
its
top
a
moment
,
and
then
--
the
horror
of
utter
darkness
*NL*
reigned
!
*NL*
*NL*
How
long
afterward
it
was
that
Becky
came
to
a
slow
consciousness
that
*NL*
she
was
crying
in
Tom
's
arms
,
neither
could
tell
.
All
that
they
knew
*NL*
was
,
that
after
what
seemed
a
mighty
stretch
of
time
,
both
awoke
out
of
*NL*
a
dead
stupor
of
sleep
and
resumed
their
miseries
once
more
.
Tom
said
*NL*
it
might
be
Sunday
,
now
--
maybe
Monday
.
He
tried
to
get
Becky
to
talk
,
but
*NL*
her
sorrows
were
too
oppressive
,
all
her
hopes
were
gone
.
Tom
said
that
*NL*
they
must
have
been
missed
long
ago
,
and
no
doubt
the
search
was
going
*NL*
on
.
He
would
shout
and
maybe
some
one
would
come
.
He
tried
it
;
but
in
*NL*
the
darkness
the
distant
echoes
sounded
so
hideously
that
he
tried
it
no
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hours
wasted
away
,
and
hunger
came
to
torment
the
captives
again
.
A
*NL*
portion
of
Tom
's
half
of
the
cake
was
left
;
they
divided
and
ate
it
.
But
*NL*
they
seemed
hungrier
than
before
.
The
poor
morsel
of
food
only
whetted
*NL*
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
By-and-by
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
SH
!
Did
you
hear
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Both
held
their
breath
and
listened
.
There
was
a
sound
like
the
*NL*
faintest
,
far-off
shout
.
Instantly
Tom
answered
it
,
and
leading
Becky
by
*NL*
the
hand
,
started
groping
down
the
corridor
in
its
direction
.
Presently
*NL*
he
listened
again
;
again
the
sound
was
heard
,
and
apparently
a
little
*NL*
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
them
!
''
said
Tom
;
``
they
're
coming
!
Come
along
,
Becky
--
we
're
all
*NL*
right
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
joy
of
the
prisoners
was
almost
overwhelming
.
Their
speed
was
slow
,
*NL*
however
,
because
pitfalls
were
somewhat
common
,
and
had
to
be
guarded
*NL*
against
.
They
shortly
came
to
one
and
had
to
stop
.
It
might
be
three
*NL*
feet
deep
,
it
might
be
a
hundred
--
there
was
no
passing
it
at
any
rate
.
*NL*
Tom
got
down
on
his
breast
and
reached
as
far
down
as
he
could
.
No
*NL*
bottom
.
They
must
stay
there
and
wait
until
the
searchers
came
.
They
*NL*
listened
;
evidently
the
distant
shoutings
were
growing
more
distant
!
*NL*
a
moment
or
two
more
and
they
had
gone
altogether
.
The
heart-sinking
*NL*
misery
of
it
!
Tom
whooped
until
he
was
hoarse
,
but
it
was
of
no
use
.
He
*NL*
talked
hopefully
to
Becky
;
but
an
age
of
anxious
waiting
passed
and
no
*NL*
sounds
came
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
groped
their
way
back
to
the
spring
.
The
weary
time
dragged
*NL*
on
;
they
slept
again
,
and
awoke
famished
and
woe-stricken
.
Tom
believed
*NL*
it
must
be
Tuesday
by
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
an
idea
struck
him
.
There
were
some
side
passages
near
at
hand
.
It
*NL*
would
be
better
to
explore
some
of
these
than
bear
the
weight
of
the
*NL*
heavy
time
in
idleness
.
He
took
a
kite-line
from
his
pocket
,
tied
it
to
*NL*
a
projection
,
and
he
and
Becky
started
,
Tom
in
the
lead
,
unwinding
the
*NL*
line
as
he
groped
along
.
At
the
end
of
twenty
steps
the
corridor
ended
*NL*
in
a
``
jumping-off
place
.
''
Tom
got
down
on
his
knees
and
felt
below
,
*NL*
and
then
as
far
around
the
corner
as
he
could
reach
with
his
hands
*NL*
conveniently
;
he
made
an
effort
to
stretch
yet
a
little
farther
to
the
*NL*
right
,
and
at
that
moment
,
not
twenty
yards
away
,
a
human
hand
,
holding
*NL*
a
candle
,
appeared
from
behind
a
rock
!
Tom
lifted
up
a
glorious
shout
,
*NL*
and
instantly
that
hand
was
followed
by
the
body
it
belonged
to
--
Injun
*NL*
Joe
's
!
Tom
was
paralyzed
;
he
could
not
move
.
He
was
vastly
gratified
the
*NL*
next
moment
,
to
see
the
``
Spaniard
''
take
to
his
heels
and
get
himself
out
*NL*
of
sight
.
Tom
wondered
that
Joe
had
not
recognized
his
voice
and
come
*NL*
over
and
killed
him
for
testifying
in
court
.
But
the
echoes
must
have
*NL*
disguised
the
voice
.
Without
doubt
,
that
was
it
,
he
reasoned
.
Tom
's
*NL*
fright
weakened
every
muscle
in
his
body
.
He
said
to
himself
that
if
he
*NL*
had
strength
enough
to
get
back
to
the
spring
he
would
stay
there
,
and
*NL*
nothing
should
tempt
him
to
run
the
risk
of
meeting
Injun
Joe
again
.
He
*NL*
was
careful
to
keep
from
Becky
what
it
was
he
had
seen
.
He
told
her
he
*NL*
had
only
shouted
``
for
luck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
hunger
and
wretchedness
rise
superior
to
fears
in
the
long
run
.
*NL*
Another
tedious
wait
at
the
spring
and
another
long
sleep
brought
*NL*
changes
.
The
children
awoke
tortured
with
a
raging
hunger
.
Tom
believed
*NL*
that
it
must
be
Wednesday
or
Thursday
or
even
Friday
or
Saturday
,
now
,
*NL*
and
that
the
search
had
been
given
over
.
He
proposed
to
explore
another
*NL*
passage
.
He
felt
willing
to
risk
Injun
Joe
and
all
other
terrors
.
But
*NL*
Becky
was
very
weak
.
She
had
sunk
into
a
dreary
apathy
and
would
not
be
*NL*
roused
.
She
said
she
would
wait
,
now
,
where
she
was
,
and
die
--
it
would
*NL*
not
be
long
.
She
told
Tom
to
go
with
the
kite-line
and
explore
if
he
*NL*
chose
;
but
she
implored
him
to
come
back
every
little
while
and
speak
*NL*
to
her
;
and
she
made
him
promise
that
when
the
awful
time
came
,
he
would
*NL*
stay
by
her
and
hold
her
hand
until
all
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
kissed
her
,
with
a
choking
sensation
in
his
throat
,
and
made
a
show
*NL*
of
being
confident
of
finding
the
searchers
or
an
escape
from
the
cave
;
*NL*
then
he
took
the
kite-line
in
his
hand
and
went
groping
down
one
of
the
*NL*
passages
on
his
hands
and
knees
,
distressed
with
hunger
and
sick
with
*NL*
bodings
of
coming
doom
.

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
TUESDAY
afternoon
came
,
and
waned
to
the
twilight
.
The
village
of
St.
*NL*
Petersburg
still
mourned
.
The
lost
children
had
not
been
found
.
Public
*NL*
prayers
had
been
offered
up
for
them
,
and
many
and
many
a
private
prayer
*NL*
that
had
the
petitioner
's
whole
heart
in
it
;
but
still
no
good
news
came
*NL*
from
the
cave
.
The
majority
of
the
searchers
had
given
up
the
quest
*NL*
and
gone
back
to
their
daily
avocations
,
saying
that
it
was
plain
the
*NL*
children
could
never
be
found
.
Mrs.
Thatcher
was
very
ill
,
and
a
great
*NL*
part
of
the
time
delirious
.
People
said
it
was
heartbreaking
to
hear
her
*NL*
call
her
child
,
and
raise
her
head
and
listen
a
whole
minute
at
a
time
,
*NL*
then
lay
it
wearily
down
again
with
a
moan
.
Aunt
Polly
had
drooped
into
*NL*
a
settled
melancholy
,
and
her
gray
hair
had
grown
almost
white
.
The
*NL*
village
went
to
its
rest
on
Tuesday
night
,
sad
and
forlorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Away
in
the
middle
of
the
night
a
wild
peal
burst
from
the
village
*NL*
bells
,
and
in
a
moment
the
streets
were
swarming
with
frantic
half-clad
*NL*
people
,
who
shouted
,
``
Turn
out
!
turn
out
!
they
're
found
!
they
're
found
!
''
*NL*
Tin
pans
and
horns
were
added
to
the
din
,
the
population
massed
itself
*NL*
and
moved
toward
the
river
,
met
the
children
coming
in
an
open
carriage
*NL*
drawn
by
shouting
citizens
,
thronged
around
it
,
joined
its
homeward
*NL*
march
,
and
swept
magnificently
up
the
main
street
roaring
huzzah
after
*NL*
huzzah
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
village
was
illuminated
;
nobody
went
to
bed
again
;
it
was
the
*NL*
greatest
night
the
little
town
had
ever
seen
.
During
the
first
half-hour
*NL*
a
procession
of
villagers
filed
through
Judge
Thatcher
's
house
,
seized
*NL*
the
saved
ones
and
kissed
them
,
squeezed
Mrs.
Thatcher
's
hand
,
tried
to
*NL*
speak
but
could
n't
--
and
drifted
out
raining
tears
all
over
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Polly
's
happiness
was
complete
,
and
Mrs.
Thatcher
's
nearly
so
.
It
*NL*
would
be
complete
,
however
,
as
soon
as
the
messenger
dispatched
with
the
*NL*
great
news
to
the
cave
should
get
the
word
to
her
husband
.
Tom
lay
upon
*NL*
a
sofa
with
an
eager
auditory
about
him
and
told
the
history
of
the
*NL*
wonderful
adventure
,
putting
in
many
striking
additions
to
adorn
it
*NL*
withal
;
and
closed
with
a
description
of
how
he
left
Becky
and
went
*NL*
on
an
exploring
expedition
;
how
he
followed
two
avenues
as
far
as
his
*NL*
kite-line
would
reach
;
how
he
followed
a
third
to
the
fullest
stretch
*NL*
of
the
kite-line
,
and
was
about
to
turn
back
when
he
glimpsed
a
far-off
*NL*
speck
that
looked
like
daylight
;
dropped
the
line
and
groped
toward
it
,
*NL*
pushed
his
head
and
shoulders
through
a
small
hole
,
and
saw
the
broad
*NL*
Mississippi
rolling
by
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
it
had
only
happened
to
be
night
he
would
not
have
seen
that
*NL*
speck
of
daylight
and
would
not
have
explored
that
passage
any
more
!
He
*NL*
told
how
he
went
back
for
Becky
and
broke
the
good
news
and
she
told
*NL*
him
not
to
fret
her
with
such
stuff
,
for
she
was
tired
,
and
knew
she
was
*NL*
going
to
die
,
and
wanted
to
.
He
described
how
he
labored
with
her
and
*NL*
convinced
her
;
and
how
she
almost
died
for
joy
when
she
had
groped
to
*NL*
where
she
actually
saw
the
blue
speck
of
daylight
;
how
he
pushed
his
way
*NL*
out
at
the
hole
and
then
helped
her
out
;
how
they
sat
there
and
cried
*NL*
for
gladness
;
how
some
men
came
along
in
a
skiff
and
Tom
hailed
them
*NL*
and
told
them
their
situation
and
their
famished
condition
;
how
the
men
*NL*
did
n't
believe
the
wild
tale
at
first
,
``
because
,
''
said
they
,
``
you
are
*NL*
five
miles
down
the
river
below
the
valley
the
cave
is
in
''
--
then
took
*NL*
them
aboard
,
rowed
to
a
house
,
gave
them
supper
,
made
them
rest
till
two
*NL*
or
three
hours
after
dark
and
then
brought
them
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
day-dawn
,
Judge
Thatcher
and
the
handful
of
searchers
with
him
*NL*
were
tracked
out
,
in
the
cave
,
by
the
twine
clews
they
had
strung
behind
*NL*
them
,
and
informed
of
the
great
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
and
nights
of
toil
and
hunger
in
the
cave
were
not
to
*NL*
be
shaken
off
at
once
,
as
Tom
and
Becky
soon
discovered
.
They
were
*NL*
bedridden
all
of
Wednesday
and
Thursday
,
and
seemed
to
grow
more
and
*NL*
more
tired
and
worn
,
all
the
time
.
Tom
got
about
,
a
little
,
on
Thursday
,
*NL*
was
downtown
Friday
,
and
nearly
as
whole
as
ever
Saturday
;
but
Becky
*NL*
did
not
leave
her
room
until
Sunday
,
and
then
she
looked
as
if
she
had
*NL*
passed
through
a
wasting
illness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
learned
of
Huck
's
sickness
and
went
to
see
him
on
Friday
,
but
could
*NL*
not
be
admitted
to
the
bedroom
;
neither
could
he
on
Saturday
or
Sunday
.
*NL*
He
was
admitted
daily
after
that
,
but
was
warned
to
keep
still
about
his
*NL*
adventure
and
introduce
no
exciting
topic
.
The
Widow
Douglas
stayed
by
*NL*
to
see
that
he
obeyed
.
At
home
Tom
learned
of
the
Cardiff
Hill
event
;
*NL*
also
that
the
``
ragged
man
's
''
body
had
eventually
been
found
in
the
river
*NL*
near
the
ferry-landing
;
he
had
been
drowned
while
trying
to
escape
,
*NL*
perhaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
fortnight
after
Tom
's
rescue
from
the
cave
,
he
started
off
to
*NL*
visit
Huck
,
who
had
grown
plenty
strong
enough
,
now
,
to
hear
exciting
*NL*
talk
,
and
Tom
had
some
that
would
interest
him
,
he
thought
.
Judge
*NL*
Thatcher
's
house
was
on
Tom
's
way
,
and
he
stopped
to
see
Becky
.
The
*NL*
Judge
and
some
friends
set
Tom
to
talking
,
and
some
one
asked
him
*NL*
ironically
if
he
would
n't
like
to
go
to
the
cave
again
.
Tom
said
he
*NL*
thought
he
would
n't
mind
it
.
The
Judge
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
are
others
just
like
you
,
Tom
,
I
've
not
the
least
doubt
.
*NL*
But
we
have
taken
care
of
that
.
Nobody
will
get
lost
in
that
cave
any
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
had
its
big
door
sheathed
with
boiler
iron
two
weeks
ago
,
and
*NL*
triple-locked
--
and
I
've
got
the
keys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
turned
as
white
as
a
sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
boy
!
Here
,
run
,
somebody
!
Fetch
a
glass
of
water
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
was
brought
and
thrown
into
Tom
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
now
you
're
all
right
.
What
was
the
matter
with
you
,
Tom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Judge
,
Injun
Joe
's
in
the
cave
!
''
*NL*

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
WITHIN
a
few
minutes
the
news
had
spread
,
and
a
dozen
skiff-loads
of
*NL*
men
were
on
their
way
to
McDougal
's
cave
,
and
the
ferryboat
,
well
filled
*NL*
with
passengers
,
soon
followed
.
Tom
Sawyer
was
in
the
skiff
that
bore
*NL*
Judge
Thatcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
cave
door
was
unlocked
,
a
sorrowful
sight
presented
itself
in
*NL*
the
dim
twilight
of
the
place
.
Injun
Joe
lay
stretched
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
dead
,
with
his
face
close
to
the
crack
of
the
door
,
as
if
his
longing
*NL*
eyes
had
been
fixed
,
to
the
latest
moment
,
upon
the
light
and
the
cheer
*NL*
of
the
free
world
outside
.
Tom
was
touched
,
for
he
knew
by
his
own
*NL*
experience
how
this
wretch
had
suffered
.
His
pity
was
moved
,
but
*NL*
nevertheless
he
felt
an
abounding
sense
of
relief
and
security
,
now
,
*NL*
which
revealed
to
him
in
a
degree
which
he
had
not
fully
appreciated
*NL*
before
how
vast
a
weight
of
dread
had
been
lying
upon
him
since
the
day
*NL*
he
lifted
his
voice
against
this
bloody-minded
outcast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Injun
Joe
's
bowie-knife
lay
close
by
,
its
blade
broken
in
two
.
The
great
*NL*
foundation-beam
of
the
door
had
been
chipped
and
hacked
through
,
with
*NL*
tedious
labor
;
useless
labor
,
too
,
it
was
,
for
the
native
rock
formed
a
*NL*
sill
outside
it
,
and
upon
that
stubborn
material
the
knife
had
wrought
*NL*
no
effect
;
the
only
damage
done
was
to
the
knife
itself
.
But
if
there
*NL*
had
been
no
stony
obstruction
there
the
labor
would
have
been
useless
*NL*
still
,
for
if
the
beam
had
been
wholly
cut
away
Injun
Joe
could
not
have
*NL*
squeezed
his
body
under
the
door
,
and
he
knew
it
.
So
he
had
only
hacked
*NL*
that
place
in
order
to
be
doing
something
--
in
order
to
pass
the
weary
*NL*
time
--
in
order
to
employ
his
tortured
faculties
.
Ordinarily
one
could
*NL*
find
half
a
dozen
bits
of
candle
stuck
around
in
the
crevices
of
this
*NL*
vestibule
,
left
there
by
tourists
;
but
there
were
none
now
.
The
prisoner
*NL*
had
searched
them
out
and
eaten
them
.
He
had
also
contrived
to
catch
a
*NL*
few
bats
,
and
these
,
also
,
he
had
eaten
,
leaving
only
their
claws
.
The
*NL*
poor
unfortunate
had
starved
to
death
.
In
one
place
,
near
at
hand
,
a
*NL*
stalagmite
had
been
slowly
growing
up
from
the
ground
for
ages
,
builded
*NL*
by
the
water-drip
from
a
stalactite
overhead
.
The
captive
had
broken
off
*NL*
the
stalagmite
,
and
upon
the
stump
had
placed
a
stone
,
wherein
he
had
*NL*
scooped
a
shallow
hollow
to
catch
the
precious
drop
that
fell
once
*NL*
in
every
three
minutes
with
the
dreary
regularity
of
a
clock-tick
--
a
*NL*
dessertspoonful
once
in
four
and
twenty
hours
.
That
drop
was
falling
*NL*
when
the
Pyramids
were
new
;
when
Troy
fell
;
when
the
foundations
of
Rome
*NL*
were
laid
;
when
Christ
was
crucified
;
when
the
Conqueror
created
the
*NL*
British
empire
;
when
Columbus
sailed
;
when
the
massacre
at
Lexington
was
*NL*
``
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
falling
now
;
it
will
still
be
falling
when
all
these
things
shall
*NL*
have
sunk
down
the
afternoon
of
history
,
and
the
twilight
of
tradition
,
*NL*
and
been
swallowed
up
in
the
thick
night
of
oblivion
.
Has
everything
a
*NL*
purpose
and
a
mission
?
Did
this
drop
fall
patiently
during
five
thousand
*NL*
years
to
be
ready
for
this
flitting
human
insect
's
need
?
and
has
it
*NL*
another
important
object
to
accomplish
ten
thousand
years
to
come
?
No
*NL*
matter
.
It
is
many
and
many
a
year
since
the
hapless
half-breed
scooped
*NL*
out
the
stone
to
catch
the
priceless
drops
,
but
to
this
day
the
tourist
*NL*
stares
longest
at
that
pathetic
stone
and
that
slow-dropping
water
when
*NL*
he
comes
to
see
the
wonders
of
McDougal
's
cave
.
Injun
Joe
's
cup
stands
*NL*
first
in
the
list
of
the
cavern
's
marvels
;
even
``
Aladdin
's
Palace
''
*NL*
can
not
rival
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Injun
Joe
was
buried
near
the
mouth
of
the
cave
;
and
people
flocked
*NL*
there
in
boats
and
wagons
from
the
towns
and
from
all
the
farms
and
*NL*
hamlets
for
seven
miles
around
;
they
brought
their
children
,
and
*NL*
all
sorts
of
provisions
,
and
confessed
that
they
had
had
almost
as
*NL*
satisfactory
a
time
at
the
funeral
as
they
could
have
had
at
the
*NL*
hanging
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
funeral
stopped
the
further
growth
of
one
thing
--
the
petition
to
the
*NL*
governor
for
Injun
Joe
's
pardon
.
The
petition
had
been
largely
signed
;
*NL*
many
tearful
and
eloquent
meetings
had
been
held
,
and
a
committee
of
*NL*
sappy
women
been
appointed
to
go
in
deep
mourning
and
wail
around
the
*NL*
governor
,
and
implore
him
to
be
a
merciful
ass
and
trample
his
duty
*NL*
under
foot
.
Injun
Joe
was
believed
to
have
killed
five
citizens
of
the
*NL*
village
,
but
what
of
that
?
If
he
had
been
Satan
himself
there
would
*NL*
have
been
plenty
of
weaklings
ready
to
scribble
their
names
to
a
*NL*
pardon-petition
,
and
drip
a
tear
on
it
from
their
permanently
impaired
*NL*
and
leaky
water-works
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
after
the
funeral
Tom
took
Huck
to
a
private
place
to
have
*NL*
an
important
talk
.
Huck
had
learned
all
about
Tom
's
adventure
from
the
*NL*
Welshman
and
the
Widow
Douglas
,
by
this
time
,
but
Tom
said
he
reckoned
*NL*
there
was
one
thing
they
had
not
told
him
;
that
thing
was
what
he
wanted
*NL*
to
talk
about
now
.
Huck
's
face
saddened
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
it
is
.
You
got
into
No.
2
and
never
found
anything
but
*NL*
whiskey
.
Nobody
told
me
it
was
you
;
but
I
just
knowed
it
must
`
a
'
ben
*NL*
you
,
soon
as
I
heard
`
bout
that
whiskey
business
;
and
I
knowed
you
*NL*
had
n't
got
the
money
becuz
you
'd
`
a
'
got
at
me
some
way
or
other
and
*NL*
told
me
even
if
you
was
mum
to
everybody
else
.
Tom
,
something
's
always
*NL*
told
me
we
'd
never
get
holt
of
that
swag
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Huck
,
I
never
told
on
that
tavern-keeper
.
_
You
_
know
his
tavern
*NL*
was
all
right
the
Saturday
I
went
to
the
picnic
.
Do
n't
you
remember
you
*NL*
was
to
watch
there
that
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
Why
,
it
seems
`
bout
a
year
ago
.
It
was
that
very
night
that
I
*NL*
follered
Injun
Joe
to
the
widder
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
followed
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
but
you
keep
mum
.
I
reckon
Injun
Joe
's
left
friends
behind
him
,
and
*NL*
I
do
n't
want
'em
souring
on
me
and
doing
me
mean
tricks
.
If
it
had
n't
*NL*
ben
for
me
he
'd
be
down
in
Texas
now
,
all
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Huck
told
his
entire
adventure
in
confidence
to
Tom
,
who
had
only
*NL*
heard
of
the
Welshman
's
part
of
it
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Huck
,
presently
,
coming
back
to
the
main
question
,
``
whoever
*NL*
nipped
the
whiskey
in
No.
2
,
nipped
the
money
,
too

I
reckon

it
's
a
goner

*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck

that
money
was

ever

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
Huck
searched
his
comrade
's
face
keenly
.
``
Tom
,
have
you
got
on
*NL*
the
track
of
that
money

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Huck
's
eyes
blazed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
it
again

Tom

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
A
trifle
after
noon
the
boys
borrowed
a
small
skiff
from
a
citizen
who
*NL*
was
absent
,
and
got
under
way
at
once
.
When
they
were
several
miles
*NL*
below
``
Cave
Hollow

Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*

you
see
this
bluff

the

down
from

no
wood-yards

all
alike

But
do
you
see

place
up
yonder

there
's
been
a

Well

that

*NL*
one
of
my
marks

We
'll
get
ashore

now

*NL*
*NL*
They
landed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Huck
,
where
we
're
a-standing

touch
that
hole

got
out

of
with
a
fishing-pole
.
See
if
you
can
find
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
searched
all
the
place
about
,
and
found
nothing
.
Tom
proudly
*NL*
marched
into
a
thick
clump
of
sumach
bushes
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
!
Look
at
it
,
Huck
;
it
's
the
snuggest
hole
in
this
country

*NL*
You
just
keep
mum
about
it
.
All
along
I
've
been
wanting
to
be
a
robber
,
*NL*
but
I
knew
I
'd
got
to
have
a
thing
like
this
,
and
where
to
run
across
*NL*
it
was
the
bother

We
've
got
it
now

and
we
'll
keep
it
quiet
,
only
we
'll
*NL*
let
Joe
Harper
and
Ben
Rogers
in
--
because
of
course
there
's
got
to
be
a
*NL*
Gang
,
or
else
there
would
n't
be
any
style
about
it
.
Tom
Sawyer
's
Gang
--
it
*NL*
sounds
splendid
,
do
n't
it
,
Huck
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
just
does

Tom

And
who
'll
we
rob
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
most
anybody

Waylay
people

that
's
mostly
the
way
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
kill
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

not
always

Hive
them
in
the
cave
till
they
raise
a
ransom

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a
ransom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Money
.
You
make
them
raise
all
they
can
,
off
'n
their
friends
;
and
after
*NL*
you
've
kept
them
a
year
,
if
it
ai
n't
raised
then
you
kill
them
.
That
's
*NL*
the
general
way
.
Only
you
do
n't
kill
the
women
.
You
shut
up
the
women
,
*NL*
but
you
do
n't
kill
them
.
They
're
always
beautiful
and
rich
,
and
awfully
*NL*
scared
.
You
take
their
watches
and
things
,
but
you
always
take
your
hat
*NL*
off
and
talk
polite
.
They
ai
n't
anybody
as
polite
as
robbers
--
you
'll
see
*NL*
that
in
any
book
.
Well
,
the
women
get
to
loving
you
,
and
after
they
've
*NL*
been
in
the
cave
a
week
or
two
weeks
they
stop
crying
and
after
that
*NL*
you
could
n't
get
them
to
leave
.
If
you
drove
them
out
they
'd
turn
right
*NL*
around
and
come
back
.
It
's
so
in
all
the
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
real
bully
,
Tom
.
I
believe
it
's
better
'n
to
be
a
pirate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
's
better
in
some
ways
,
because
it
's
close
to
home
and
circuses
*NL*
and
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
everything
was
ready
and
the
boys
entered
the
hole
,
Tom
in
*NL*
the
lead
.
They
toiled
their
way
to
the
farther
end
of
the
tunnel
,
then
*NL*
made
their
spliced
kite-strings
fast
and
moved
on
.
A
few
steps
brought
*NL*
them
to
the
spring
,
and
Tom
felt
a
shudder
quiver
all
through
him
.
*NL*
He
showed
Huck
the
fragment
of
candle-wick
perched
on
a
lump
of
clay
*NL*
against
the
wall
,
and
described
how
he
and
Becky
had
watched
the
flame
*NL*
struggle
and
expire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
began
to
quiet
down
to
whispers
,
now
,
for
the
stillness
and
*NL*
gloom
of
the
place
oppressed
their
spirits
.
They
went
on
,
and
presently
*NL*
entered
and
followed
Tom
's
other
corridor
until
they
reached
the
*NL*
``
jumping-off
place
.
''
The
candles
revealed
the
fact
that
it
was
not
*NL*
really
a
precipice
,
but
only
a
steep
clay
hill
twenty
or
thirty
feet
*NL*
high
.
Tom
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
'll
show
you
something
,
Huck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
his
candle
aloft
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
as
far
around
the
corner
as
you
can
.
Do
you
see
that
?
There

on
the
*NL*
big
rock
over
yonder
--
done
with
candle-smoke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom

it
's

Now

's
your
Number
Two

_
under
the

Right
yonder
's
*NL*
where
I
saw
Injun
Joe
poke
up
his
candle
,
Huck
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
stared
at
the
mystic
sign
awhile
,
and
then
said
with
a
shaky
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
less
git
out
of
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
and
leave
the
treasure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

leave
it

round
about
there

certain

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
it

n't

Huck

no

would
ha

the
place

he
*NL*
died

away
out
at
the
mouth
of
the
cave
--
five
mile
from
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Tom
,
it
would

It
would
hang
round
the
money

I
know
the
ways
of
*NL*
ghosts
,
and
so
do
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
began
to
fear
that
Huck
was
right
.
Mis-givings
gathered
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
But
presently
an
idea
occurred
to
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lookyhere
,
Huck
,
what
fools
we
're
making
of
ourselves
!
Injun
Joe
's
*NL*
ghost
ai
n't
a
going
to
come
around
where
there
's
a
cross
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
point
was
well
taken
.
It
had
its
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
I
did
n't
think
of
that
.
But
that
's
so
.
It
's
luck
for
us
,
that
*NL*
cross
is
.
I
reckon
we
'll
climb
down
there
and
have
a
hunt
for
that
box
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
went
first
,
cutting
rude
steps
in
the
clay
hill
as
he
descended
.
*NL*
Huck
followed
.
Four
avenues
opened
out
of
the
small
cavern
which
the
*NL*
great
rock
stood
in
.
The
boys
examined
three
of
them
with
no
result
.
*NL*
They
found
a
small
recess
in
the
one
nearest
the
base
of
the
rock
,
with
*NL*
a
pallet
of
blankets
spread
down
in
it
;
also
an
old
suspender
,
some
*NL*
bacon
rind
,
and
the
well-gnawed
bones
of
two
or
three
fowls
.
But
there
*NL*
was
no
moneybox
.
The
lads
searched
and
researched
this
place
,
but
in
*NL*
vain
.
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
_
under
_
the
cross
.
Well
,
this
comes
nearest
to
being
under
the
*NL*
cross
.
It
ca
n't
be
under
the
rock
itself
,
because
that
sets
solid
on
the
*NL*
ground
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
searched
everywhere
once
more
,
and
then
sat
down
discouraged
.
Huck
*NL*
could
suggest
nothing
.
By-and-by
Tom
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lookyhere
,
Huck
,
there
's
footprints
and
some
candle-grease
on
the
clay
*NL*
about
one
side
of
this
rock
,
but
not
on
the
other
sides
.
Now
,
what
's
*NL*
that
for
?
I
bet
you
the
money
_
is
_
under
the
rock
.
I
'm
going
to
dig
in
*NL*
the
clay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
ai
n't
no
bad
notion
,
Tom
!
''
said
Huck
with
animation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
's
``
real
Barlow
''
was
out
at
once
,
and
he
had
not
dug
four
inches
*NL*
before
he
struck
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
,
Huck
!
--
you
hear
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
began
to
dig
and
scratch
now
.
Some
boards
were
soon
uncovered
and
*NL*
removed
.
They
had
concealed
a
natural
chasm
which
led
under
the
rock
.
*NL*
Tom
got
into
this
and
held
his
candle
as
far
under
the
rock
as
he
*NL*
could
,
but
said
he
could
not
see
to
the
end
of
the
rift
.
He
proposed
*NL*
to
explore
.
He
stooped
and
passed
under
;
the
narrow
way
descended
*NL*
gradually
.
He
followed
its
winding
course
,
first
to
the
right
,
then
to
*NL*
the
left
,
Huck
at
his
heels
.
Tom
turned
a
short
curve
,
by-and-by
,
and
*NL*
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
goodness
,
Huck
,
lookyhere
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
treasure-box
,
sure
enough
,
occupying
a
snug
little
cavern
,
*NL*
along
with
an
empty
powder-keg
,
a
couple
of
guns
in
leather
cases
,
two
*NL*
or
three
pairs
of
old
moccasins
,
a
leather
belt
,
and
some
other
rubbish
*NL*
well
soaked
with
the
water-drip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Got
it
at
last
!
''
said
Huck
,
ploughing
among
the
tarnished
coins
with
*NL*
his
hand
.
``
My
,
but
we
're

Huck

I
always
reckoned
we

It

just
too
good
to
believe

*NL*
we

have

got
it

sure

Say

let

not

around

Let

out

Lem
me
see
if
I
can
lift

box

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
weighed
about
fifty
pounds
.
Tom
could
lift
it
,
after
an
awkward
*NL*
fashion
,
but
could
not
carry
it
conveniently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so

he
said
;

_
They
_
carried
it
like
it
was
heavy

that
day
*NL*
at
the
ha

house

I
noticed
that
.
I
reckon
I
was
right
to
think
of
*NL*
fetching
the
little
bags
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
money
was
soon
in
the
bags
and
the
boys
took
it
up
to
the
cross
*NL*
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
less
fetch
the
guns
and
things
,
''
said
Huck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Huck

leave
them
there

They
're
just
the
tricks
to
have
when
we

go
to
robbing

We
'll
keep
them
there
all
the
time

and
we
'll
hold
our

orgies
there

too

It
's
an
awful
snug
place
for
orgies

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
orgies
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

But
robbers
always
have
orgies

we

got
to

have

too

Come
along
,
Huck
,
we
've
been
in
here
a
long
time

It
's
*NL*
getting
late
,
I
reckon
.
I
'm
hungry
,
too

We
'll
eat
and
smoke
when
we
get
*NL*
to
the
skiff
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
presently
emerged
into
the
clump
of
sumach
bushes
,
looked
warily
*NL*
out
,
found
the
coast
clear
,
and
were
soon
lunching
and
smoking
in
the
*NL*
skiff
.
As
the
sun
dipped
toward
the
horizon
they
pushed
out
and
got
*NL*
under
way
.
Tom
skimmed
up
the
shore
through
the
long
twilight
,
chatting
*NL*
cheerily
with
Huck
,
and
landed
shortly
after
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Huck
,
''
said
Tom
,
``
we
'll
hide
the
money
in
the
loft
of
the
widow

*NL*
woodshed
,
and
I
'll
come
up
in
the
morning
and
we
'll
count
it
and
divide
,
*NL*
and
then
we
'll
hunt
up
a
place
out
in
the
woods
for
it
where
it
will
be
*NL*
safe
.
Just
you
lay
quiet
here
and
watch
the
stuff
till
I
run
and
hook
*NL*
Benny
Taylor
's
little
wagon
;
I
wo
n't
be
gone
a

*NL*
*NL*
He
disappeared
,
and
presently
returned
with
the
wagon
,
put
the
two
small
*NL*
sacks
into
it
,
threw
some
old
rags
on
top
of
them
,
and
started
off
,
*NL*
dragging
his
cargo
behind
him
.
When
the
boys
reached
the
Welshman
's
*NL*
house
,
they
stopped
to
rest
.
Just
as
they
were
about
to
move
on
,
the
*NL*
Welshman
stepped
out
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hallo
,
who
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck

Tom
Sawyer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
Come
along

you
are
keeping
everybody
waiting

*NL*
Here

hurry
up
,
trot
ahead
--
I
'll
haul
the
wagon
for
you
.
Why
,
it
's
not
as
*NL*
light
as
it
might
be
.
Got
bricks
in
it
?
--
or
old
metal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
metal
,
''
said
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
judged
so
;
the
boys
in
this
town
will
take
more
trouble
and
fool
away
*NL*
more
time
hunting
up
six
bits
'
worth
of
old
iron
to
sell
to
the
foundry
*NL*
than
they
would
to
make
twice
the
money
at
regular
work

But
that
's
*NL*
human
nature
--
hurry
along
,
hurry
along
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boys
wanted
to
know
what
the
hurry
was
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
;
you
'll
see
,
when
we
get
to
the
Widow
Douglas
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
said
with
some
apprehension
--
for
he
was
long
used
to
being
falsely
*NL*
accused
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Jones
,
we
have
n't
been
doing
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Welshman
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
Huck
,
my
boy
.
I
do
n't
know
about
that

Ai
n't
you
*NL*
and
the
widow
good
friends
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Well

she
's
ben
good
friends
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
then
.
What
do
you
want
to
be
afraid
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
question
was
not
entirely
answered
in
Huck
's
slow
mind
before
he
*NL*
found
himself
pushed
,
along
with
Tom
,
into
Mrs.
Douglas
'
drawing-room
.
*NL*
Mr.
Jones
left
the
wagon
near
the
door
and
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
was
grandly
lighted
,
and
everybody
that
was
of
any
consequence
*NL*
in
the
village
was
there
.
The
Thatchers
were
there
,
the
Harpers
,
the
*NL*
Rogerses
,
Aunt
Polly
,
Sid
,
Mary
,
the
minister
,
the
editor
,
and
a
great
*NL*
many
more
,
and
all
dressed
in
their
best
.
The
widow
received
the
boys
*NL*
as
heartily
as
any
one
could
well
receive
two
such
looking
beings
.
They
*NL*
were
covered
with
clay
and
candle-grease
.
Aunt
Polly
blushed
crimson
*NL*
with
humiliation
,
and
frowned
and
shook
her
head
at
Tom
.
Nobody
suffered
*NL*
half
as
much
as
the
two
boys
did
,
however
.
Mr.
Jones
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
was
n't
at
home
,
yet
,
so
I
gave
him
up
;
but
I
stumbled
on
him
and
*NL*
Huck
right
at
my
door
,
and
so
I
just
brought
them
along
in
a
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
did
just
right
,
''
said
the
widow
.
``
Come
with
me
,
boys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
them
to
a
bedchamber
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
wash
and
dress
yourselves
.
Here
are
two
new
suits

clothes

shirts

They
're
Huck
's

no

no
*NL*

Huck

Mr.
Jones
bought
one
and
I
the
other

But
they
'll
fit
both

of
you

Get
into
them

We
'll
wait

come
down
when
you

enough

said
:

Sid
appeared

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
he
,
``

``
It
's
one
of

parties

she

always
having

for
the
Welshman

his
sons

on
account
of
that
scrape
they

helped
her
out
of
the

``
Why

Mr.

going
to
try

something
on

people

here
tonight

but
I
overheard
him
tell
auntie
today
about
it

as
a

secret

I
reckon
it
's
not
much
of

secret
now

Everybody
knows

the
*NL*
widow

too
,
for
all
she
tries
to
let
on
she
do

Mr.

was
bound

be
here

About

going

make
a
grand
time
over
his
surprise
,
but
I
bet
you
it
will
drop
*NL*
pretty
flat

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sid
chuckled
in
a
very
contented
and
satisfied
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sid
,
was
it
you
that
told
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
never
mind
who
it
was
.
_
Somebody
_
told
--
that
's
enough

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sid
,
there
's
only
one
person
in
this
town
mean
enough
to
do
that
,
and
*NL*
that
's
you
.
If
you
had
been
in
Huck
's
place
you
'd
`
a
'
sneaked
down
the
*NL*
hill
and
never
told
anybody
on
the
robbers
.
You
ca
n't
do
any
but
mean
*NL*
things
,
and
you
ca
n't
bear
to
see
anybody
praised
for
doing
good
ones
.
*NL*
There
--
no
thanks
,
as
the
widow
says
''
--
and
Tom
cuffed
Sid
's
ears
and
helped
*NL*
him
to
the
door
with
several
kicks
.
``
Now
go
and
tell
auntie
if
you
*NL*
dare
--
and
tomorrow
you
'll
catch
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
minutes
later
the
widow
's
guests
were
at
the
supper-table
,
and
a
*NL*
dozen
children
were
propped
up
at
little
side-tables
in
the
same
room
,
*NL*
after
the
fashion
of
that
country
and
that
day
.
At
the
proper
time
Mr.
*NL*
Jones
made
his
little
speech
,
in
which
he
thanked
the
widow
for
the
*NL*
honor
she
was
doing
himself
and
his
sons
,
but
said
that
there
was
*NL*
another
person
whose
modesty
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
forth
and
so
on
.
He
sprung
his
secret
about
Huck
's
share
in
*NL*
the
adventure
in
the
finest
dramatic
manner
he
was
master
of
,
but
the
*NL*
surprise
it
occasioned
was
largely
counterfeit
and
not
as
clamorous
and
*NL*
effusive
as
it
might
have
been
under
happier
circumstances
.
However
,
*NL*
the
widow
made
a
pretty
fair
show
of
astonishment
,
and
heaped
so
many
*NL*
compliments
and
so
much
gratitude
upon
Huck
that
he
almost
forgot
*NL*
the
nearly
intolerable
discomfort
of
his
new
clothes
in
the
entirely
*NL*
intolerable
discomfort
of
being
set
up
as
a
target
for
everybody
's
gaze
*NL*
and
everybody
's
laudations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
widow
said
she
meant
to
give
Huck
a
home
under
her
roof
and
have
him
*NL*
educated
;
and
that
when
she
could
spare
the
money
she
would
start
him
in
*NL*
business
in
a
modest
way
.
Tom
's
chance
was
come
.
He
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
do
n't
need
it
.
Huck
's
rich
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
but
a
heavy
strain
upon
the
good
manners
of
the
company
kept
*NL*
back
the
due
and
proper
complimentary
laugh
at
this
pleasant
joke
.
But
*NL*
the
silence
was
a
little
awkward
.
Tom
broke
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huck
's
got
money
.
Maybe
you
do
n't
believe
it
,
but
he
's
got
lots
of
it
.
*NL*
Oh
,
you
need
n't
smile
--
I
reckon
I
can
show
you
.
You
just
wait
a
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
ran
out
of
doors
.
The
company
looked
at
each
other
with
a
perplexed
*NL*
interest
--
and
inquiringly
at
Huck
,
who
was
tongue-tied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sid
,
what
ails
Tom
?
''
said
Aunt
Polly
.
``
He
--
well
,
there
ai
n't
ever
any
*NL*
making
of
that
boy
out
.
I
never
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
entered
,
struggling
with
the
weight
of
his
sacks
,
and
Aunt
Polly
*NL*
did
not
finish
her
sentence
.
Tom
poured
the
mass
of
yellow
coin
upon
the
*NL*
table
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
what
did
I
tell
you
?
Half
of
it
's
Huck
's
and
half
of
it
's
mine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
spectacle
took
the
general
breath
away
.
All
gazed
,
nobody
spoke
for
*NL*
a
moment
.
Then
there
was
a
unanimous
call
for
an
explanation
.
Tom
said
*NL*
he
could
furnish
it
,
and
he
did
.
The
tale
was
long
,
but
brimful
of
*NL*
interest
.
There
was
scarcely
an
interruption
from
any
one
to
break
the
*NL*
charm
of
its
flow
.
When
he
had
finished
,
Mr.
Jones
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
had
fixed
up
a
little
surprise
for
this
occasion
,
but
it
*NL*
do
n't
amount
to
anything
now
.
This
one
makes
it
sing
mighty
small
,
I
'm
*NL*
willing
to
allow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
money
was
counted
.
The
sum
amounted
to
a
little
over
twelve
thousand
*NL*
dollars
.
It
was
more
than
any
one
present
had
ever
seen
at
one
time
*NL*
before
,
though
several
persons
were
there
who
were
worth
considerably
*NL*
more
than
that
in
property
.

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
THE
reader
may
rest
satisfied
that
Tom
's
and
Huck
's
windfall
made
a
*NL*
mighty
stir
in
the
poor
little
village
of
St.
Petersburg
.
So
vast
a
*NL*
sum
,
all
in
actual
cash
,
seemed
next
to
incredible
.
It
was
talked
*NL*
about
,
gloated
over
,
glorified
,
until
the
reason
of
many
of
the
citizens
*NL*
tottered
under
the
strain
of
the
unhealthy
excitement
.
Every
``
haunted
''
*NL*
house
in
St.
Petersburg
and
the
neighboring
villages
was
dissected
,
*NL*
plank
by
plank
,
and
its
foundations
dug
up
and
ransacked
for
hidden
*NL*
treasure
--
and
not
by
boys
,
but
men
--
pretty
grave
,
unromantic
men
,
too
,
*NL*
some
of
them
.
Wherever
Tom
and
Huck
appeared
they
were
courted
,
admired
,
*NL*
stared
at
.
The
boys
were
not
able
to
remember
that
their
remarks
had
*NL*
possessed
weight
before
;
but
now
their
sayings
were
treasured
and
*NL*
repeated
;
everything
they
did
seemed
somehow
to
be
regarded
as
*NL*
remarkable
;
they
had
evidently
lost
the
power
of
doing
and
saying
*NL*
commonplace
things
;
moreover
,
their
past
history
was
raked
up
and
*NL*
discovered
to
bear
marks
of
conspicuous
originality
.
The
village
paper
*NL*
published
biographical
sketches
of
the
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Widow
Douglas
put
Huck
's
money
out
at
six
per
cent.
,
and
Judge
*NL*
Thatcher
did
the
same
with
Tom
's
at
Aunt
Polly
's
request
.
Each
lad
had
*NL*
an
income
,
now
,
that
was
simply
prodigious
--
a
dollar
for
every
weekday
in
*NL*
the
year
and
half
of
the
Sundays
.
It
was
just
what
the
minister
got
--
no
,
*NL*
it
was
what
he
was
promised
--
he
generally
could
n't
collect
it
.
A
dollar
*NL*
and
a
quarter
a
week
would
board
,
lodge
,
and
school
a
boy
in
those
old
*NL*
simple
days
--
and
clothe
him
and
wash
him
,
too
,
for
that
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Thatcher
had
conceived
a
great
opinion
of
Tom
.
He
said
that
no
*NL*
commonplace
boy
would
ever
have
got
his
daughter
out
of
the
cave
.
When
*NL*
Becky
told
her
father
,
in
strict
confidence
,
how
Tom
had
taken
her
*NL*
whipping
at
school
,
the
Judge
was
visibly
moved
;
and
when
she
pleaded
*NL*
grace
for
the
mighty
lie
which
Tom
had
told
in
order
to
shift
that
*NL*
whipping
from
her
shoulders
to
his
own
,
the
Judge
said
with
a
fine
*NL*
outburst
that
it
was
a
noble
,
a
generous
,
a
magnanimous
lie
--
a
lie
that
*NL*
was
worthy
to
hold
up
its
head
and
march
down
through
history
breast
to
*NL*
breast
with
George
Washington
's
lauded
Truth
about
the
hatchet
!
Becky
*NL*
thought
her
father
had
never
looked
so
tall
and
so
superb
as
when
he
*NL*
walked
the
floor
and
stamped
his
foot
and
said
that
.
She
went
straight
*NL*
off
and
told
Tom
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Thatcher
hoped
to
see
Tom
a
great
lawyer
or
a
great
soldier
some
*NL*
day
.
He
said
he
meant
to
look
to
it
that
Tom
should
be
admitted
to
the
*NL*
National
Military
Academy
and
afterward
trained
in
the
best
law
school
*NL*
in
the
country
,
in
order
that
he
might
be
ready
for
either
career
or
*NL*
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
Huck
Finn
's
wealth
and
the
fact
that
he
was
now
under
the
Widow
Douglas
'
*NL*
protection
introduced
him
into
society
--
no
,
dragged
him
into
it
,
hurled
*NL*
him
into
it
--
and
his
sufferings
were
almost
more
than
he
could
bear
.
The
*NL*
widow
's
servants
kept
him
clean
and
neat
,
combed
and
brushed
,
and
they
*NL*
bedded
him
nightly
in
unsympathetic
sheets
that
had
not
one
little
spot
*NL*
or
stain
which
he
could
press
to
his
heart
and
know
for
a
friend
.
He
had
*NL*
to
eat
with
a
knife
and
fork
;
he
had
to
use
napkin
,
cup
,
and
plate
;
*NL*
he
had
to
learn
his
book
,
he
had
to
go
to
church
;
he
had
to
talk
so
*NL*
properly
that
speech
was
become
insipid
in
his
mouth
;
whithersoever
he
*NL*
turned
,
the
bars
and
shackles
of
civilization
shut
him
in
and
bound
him
*NL*
hand
and
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bravely
bore
his
miseries
three
weeks
,
and
then
one
day
turned
up
*NL*
missing
.
For
forty-eight
hours
the
widow
hunted
for
him
everywhere
in
*NL*
great
distress
.
The
public
were
profoundly
concerned
;
they
searched
high
*NL*
and
low
,
they
dragged
the
river
for
his
body
.
Early
the
third
morning
*NL*
Tom
Sawyer
wisely
went
poking
among
some
old
empty
hogsheads
down
behind
*NL*
the
abandoned
slaughter-house
,
and
in
one
of
them
he
found
the
refugee
.
*NL*
Huck
had
slept
there
;
he
had
just
breakfasted
upon
some
stolen
odds
and
*NL*
ends
of
food
,
and
was
lying
off
,
now
,
in
comfort
,
with
his
pipe
.
He
was
*NL*
unkempt
,
uncombed
,
and
clad
in
the
same
old
ruin
of
rags
that
had
made
*NL*
him
picturesque
in
the
days
when
he
was
free
and
happy
.
Tom
routed
him
*NL*
out
,
told
him
the
trouble
he
had
been
causing
,
and
urged
him
to
go
home
.
*NL*
Huck
's
face
lost
its
tranquil
content
,
and
took
a
melancholy
cast
.
He
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't

CONCLUSION
*NL*
*NL*
SO
endeth
this
chronicle
.
It
being
strictly
a
history
of
a
_
boy
_
,
it
*NL*
must
stop
here
;
the
story
could
not
go
much
further
without
becoming
the
*NL*
history
of
a
_
man
_
.
When
one
writes
a
novel
about
grown
people
,
he
knows
*NL*
exactly
where
to
stop
--
that
is
,
with
a
marriage
;
but
when
he
writes
of
*NL*
juveniles
,
he
must
stop
where
he
best
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
characters
that
perform
in
this
book
still
live
,
and
are
*NL*
prosperous
and
happy
.
Some
day
it
may
seem
worth
while
to
take
up
the
*NL*
story
of
the
younger
ones
again
and
see
what
sort
of
men
and
women
they
*NL*
turned
out
to
be
;
therefore
it
will
be
wisest
not
to
reveal
any
of
that
*NL*
part
of
their
lives
at
present
.
