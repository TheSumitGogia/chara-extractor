SQUIRE

particulars
about

from

keeping
nothing
back
but
the
bearings
of
the
*NL*
island
,
and
that
only
because
there
is
still
treasure
not
yet
lifted
,
I
*NL*
take
up
my
pen
in
the
year
of
grace
17
__
and
go
back
to
the
time
when
*NL*
my
father
kept
the
Admiral
Benbow
inn
and
the
brown
old
seaman
with
the
*NL*
sabre
cut
first
took
up
his
lodging
under
our
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
him
as
if
it
were
yesterday
,
as
he
came
plodding
to
the
*NL*
inn
door
,
his
sea-chest
following
behind
him
in
a
hand-barrow
--
a
*NL*
tall
,
strong
,
heavy
,
nut-brown
man
,
his
tarry
pigtail
falling
over
the
*NL*
shoulder
of
his
soiled
blue
coat
,
his
hands
ragged
and
scarred
,
with
*NL*
black
,
broken
nails
,
and
the
sabre
cut
across
one
cheek
,
a
dirty
,
livid
*NL*
white
.
I
remember
him
looking
round
the
cover
and
whistling
to
himself
*NL*
as
he
did
so
,
and
then
breaking
out
in
that
old
sea-song
that
he
sang
so
*NL*
often
afterwards
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
men
on
the
dead
man
's
chest
--
*NL*
Yo-ho-ho
,
and
a
bottle
of
rum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
in
the
high
,
old
tottering
voice
that
seemed
to
have
been
tuned
and
*NL*
broken
at
the
capstan
bars
.
Then
he
rapped
on
the
door
with
a
bit
of
*NL*
stick
like
a
handspike
that
he
carried
,
and
when
my
father
appeared
,
*NL*
called
roughly
for
a
glass
of
rum
.
This
,
when
it
was
brought
to
him
,
*NL*
he
drank
slowly
,
like
a
connoisseur
,
lingering
on
the
taste
and
still
*NL*
looking
about
him
at
the
cliffs
and
up
at
our
signboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
handy
cove
,
''
says
he
at
length
;
``
and
a
pleasant
sittyated
*NL*
grog-shop
.
Much
company
,
mate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
told
him
no
,
very
little
company
,
the
more
was
the
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
he
,
``
this
is
the
berth
for
me
.
Here
you
,
matey
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
to
the
man
who
trundled
the
barrow
;
``
bring
up
alongside
and
help
*NL*
up
my
chest
.
I
'll
stay
here
a
bit
,
''
he
continued
.
``
I
'm
a
plain
man
;
rum
*NL*
and
bacon
and
eggs
is
what
I
want
,
and
that
head
up
there
for
to
watch
*NL*
ships
off
.
What
you
mought
call
me
?
You
mought
call
me
captain
.
Oh
,
I
*NL*
see
what
you
're
at
--
there
''
;
and
he
threw
down
three
or
four
gold
pieces
*NL*
on
the
threshold
.
``
You
can
tell
me
when
I
've
worked
through
that
,
''
says
*NL*
he
,
looking
as
fierce
as
a
commander
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
indeed
bad
as
his
clothes
were
and
coarsely
as
he
spoke
,
he
had
none
*NL*
of
the
appearance
of
a
man
who
sailed
before
the
mast
,
but
seemed
like
*NL*
a
mate
or
skipper
accustomed
to
be
obeyed
or
to
strike
.
The
man
who
came
*NL*
with
the
barrow
told
us
the
mail
had
set
him
down
the
morning
before
at
*NL*
the
Royal
George
,
that
he
had
inquired
what
inns
there
were
along
the
*NL*
coast
,
and
hearing
ours
well
spoken
of
,
I
suppose
,
and
described
as
*NL*
lonely
,
had
chosen
it
from
the
others
for
his
place
of
residence
.
And
*NL*
that
was
all
we
could
learn
of
our
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
very
silent
man
by
custom
.
All
day
he
hung
round
the
cove
or
*NL*
upon
the
cliffs
with
a
brass
telescope
;
all
evening
he
sat
in
a
corner
*NL*
of
the
parlour
next
the
fire
and
drank
rum
and
water
very
strong
.
Mostly
*NL*
he
would
not
speak
when
spoken
to
,
only
look
up
sudden
and
fierce
and
*NL*
blow
through
his
nose
like
a
fog-horn
;
and
we
and
the
people
who
came
*NL*
about
our
house
soon
learned
to
let
him
be
.
Every
day
when
he
came
back
*NL*
from
his
stroll
he
would
ask
if
any
seafaring
men
had
gone
by
along
the
*NL*
road
.
At
first
we
thought
it
was
the
want
of
company
of
his
own
kind
*NL*
that
made
him
ask
this
question
,
but
at
last
we
began
to
see
he
was
*NL*
desirous
to
avoid
them
.
When
a
seaman
did
put
up
at
the
Admiral
Benbow
*NL*
-LRB-
as
now
and
then
some
did
,
making
by
the
coast
road
for
Bristol
-RRB-
he
*NL*
would
look
in
at
him
through
the
curtained
door
before
he
entered
the
*NL*
parlour
;
and
he
was
always
sure
to
be
as
silent
as
a
mouse
when
any
such
*NL*
was
present
.
For
me
,
at
least
,
there
was
no
secret
about
the
matter
,
for
*NL*
I
was
,
in
a
way
,
a
sharer
in
his
alarms
.
He
had
taken
me
aside
one
day
*NL*
and
promised
me
a
silver
fourpenny
on
the
first
of
every
month
if
I
*NL*
would
only
keep
my
``
weather-eye
open
for
a
seafaring
man
with
one
leg
''
*NL*
and
let
him
know
the
moment
he
appeared
.
Often
enough
when
the
first
*NL*
of
the
month
came
round
and
I
applied
to
him
for
my
wage
,
he
would
only
*NL*
blow
through
his
nose
at
me
and
stare
me
down
,
but
before
the
week
was
*NL*
out
he
was
sure
to
think
better
of
it
,
bring
me
my
four-penny
piece
,
and
*NL*
repeat
his
orders
to
look
out
for
``
the
seafaring
man
with
one
leg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
that
personage
haunted
my
dreams
,
I
need
scarcely
tell
you
.
On
*NL*
stormy
nights
,
when
the
wind
shook
the
four
corners
of
the
house
and
*NL*
the
surf
roared
along
the
cove
and
up
the
cliffs
,
I
would
see
him
in
a
*NL*
thousand
forms
,
and
with
a
thousand
diabolical
expressions
.
Now
the
leg
*NL*
would
be
cut
off
at
the
knee
,
now
at
the
hip
;
now
he
was
a
monstrous
*NL*
kind
of
a
creature
who
had
never
had
but
the
one
leg
,
and
that
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
his
body
.
To
see
him
leap
and
run
and
pursue
me
over
hedge
and
*NL*
ditch
was
the
worst
of
nightmares
.
And
altogether
I
paid
pretty
dear
for
*NL*
my
monthly
fourpenny
piece
,
in
the
shape
of
these
abominable
fancies
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
though
I
was
so
terrified
by
the
idea
of
the
seafaring
man
with
one
*NL*
leg
,
I
was
far
less
afraid
of
the
captain
himself
than
anybody
else
who
*NL*
knew
him
.
There
were
nights
when
he
took
a
deal
more
rum
and
water
*NL*
than
his
head
would
carry
;
and
then
he
would
sometimes
sit
and
sing
his
*NL*
wicked
,
old
,
wild
sea-songs
,
minding
nobody
;
but
sometimes
he
would
call
*NL*
for
glasses
round
and
force
all
the
trembling
company
to
listen
to
his
*NL*
stories
or
bear
a
chorus
to
his
singing
.
Often
I
have
heard
the
house
*NL*
shaking
with
``
Yo-ho-ho
,
and
a
bottle
of
rum
,
''
all
the
neighbours
joining
*NL*
in
for
dear
life
,
with
the
fear
of
death
upon
them
,
and
each
singing
*NL*
louder
than
the
other
to
avoid
remark
.
For
in
these
fits
he
was
the
most
*NL*
overriding
companion
ever
known
;
he
would
slap
his
hand
on
the
table
for
*NL*
silence
all
round
;
he
would
fly
up
in
a
passion
of
anger
at
a
question
,
*NL*
or
sometimes
because
none
was
put
,
and
so
he
judged
the
company
was
not
*NL*
following
his
story
.
Nor
would
he
allow
anyone
to
leave
the
inn
till
he
*NL*
had
drunk
himself
sleepy
and
reeled
off
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
stories
were
what
frightened
people
worst
of
all
.
Dreadful
stories
*NL*
they
were
--
about
hanging
,
and
walking
the
plank
,
and
storms
at
sea
,
and
*NL*
the
Dry
Tortugas
,
and
wild
deeds
and
places
on
the
Spanish
Main
.
By
his
*NL*
own
account
he
must
have
lived
his
life
among
some
of
the
wickedest
men
*NL*
that
God
ever
allowed
upon
the
sea
,
and
the
language
in
which
he
told
*NL*
these
stories
shocked
our
plain
country
people
almost
as
much
as
the
*NL*
crimes
that
he
described
.
My
father
was
always
saying
the
inn
would
be
*NL*
ruined
,
for
people
would
soon
cease
coming
there
to
be
tyrannized
over
*NL*
and
put
down
,
and
sent
shivering
to
their
beds
;
but
I
really
believe
his
*NL*
presence
did
us
good
.
People
were
frightened
at
the
time
,
but
on
looking
*NL*
back
they
rather
liked
it
;
it
was
a
fine
excitement
in
a
quiet
country
*NL*
life
,
and
there
was
even
a
party
of
the
younger
men
who
pretended
to
*NL*
admire
him
,
calling
him
a
``
true
sea-dog
''
and
a
``
real
old
salt
''
and
*NL*
such
like
names
,
and
saying
there
was
the
sort
of
man
that
made
England
*NL*
terrible
at
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
way
,
indeed
,
he
bade
fair
to
ruin
us
,
for
he
kept
on
staying
week
*NL*
after
week
,
and
at
last
month
after
month
,
so
that
all
the
money
had
*NL*
been
long
exhausted
,
and
still
my
father
never
plucked
up
the
heart
to
*NL*
insist
on
having
more
.
If
ever
he
mentioned
it
,
the
captain
blew
through
*NL*
his
nose
so
loudly
that
you
might
say
he
roared
,
and
stared
my
poor
*NL*
father
out
of
the
room
.
I
have
seen
him
wringing
his
hands
after
such
a
*NL*
rebuff
,
and
I
am
sure
the
annoyance
and
the
terror
he
lived
in
must
have
*NL*
greatly
hastened
his
early
and
unhappy
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
he
lived
with
us
the
captain
made
no
change
whatever
in
his
*NL*
dress
but
to
buy
some
stockings
from
a
hawker
.
One
of
the
cocks
of
his
*NL*
hat
having
fallen
down
,
he
let
it
hang
from
that
day
forth
,
though
it
*NL*
was
a
great
annoyance
when
it
blew
.
I
remember
the
appearance
of
his
*NL*
coat
,
which
he
patched
himself
upstairs
in
his
room
,
and
which
,
before
*NL*
the
end
,
was
nothing
but
patches
.
He
never
wrote
or
received
a
letter
,
*NL*
and
he
never
spoke
with
any
but
the
neighbours
,
and
with
these
,
for
the
*NL*
most
part
,
only
when
drunk
on
rum
.
The
great
sea-chest
none
of
us
had
*NL*
ever
seen
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
only
once
crossed
,
and
that
was
towards
the
end
,
when
my
poor
*NL*
father
was
far
gone
in
a
decline
that
took
him
off
.
Dr.
Livesey
came
*NL*
late
one
afternoon
to
see
the
patient
,
took
a
bit
of
dinner
from
my
*NL*
mother
,
and
went
into
the
parlour
to
smoke
a
pipe
until
his
horse
should
*NL*
come
down
from
the
hamlet
,
for
we
had
no
stabling
at
the
old
Benbow
.
I
*NL*
followed
him
in
,
and
I
remember
observing
the
contrast
the
neat
,
bright
*NL*
doctor
,
with
his
powder
as
white
as
snow
and
his
bright
,
black
eyes
and
*NL*
pleasant
manners
,
made
with
the
coltish
country
folk
,
and
above
all
,
*NL*
with
that
filthy
,
heavy
,
bleared
scarecrow
of
a
pirate
of
ours
,
sitting
,
*NL*
far
gone
in
rum
,
with
his
arms
on
the
table
.
Suddenly
he
--
the
captain
,
*NL*
that
is
--
began
to
pipe
up
his
eternal
song
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
men
on
the
dead
man
's
chest
--
*NL*
Yo-ho-ho
,
and
a
bottle
of
rum
!
*NL*
Drink
and
the
devil
had
done
for
the
rest
--
*NL*
Yo-ho-ho
,
and
a
bottle
of
rum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
I
had
supposed
``
the
dead
man
's
chest
''
to
be
that
identical
big
*NL*
box
of
his
upstairs
in
the
front
room
,
and
the
thought
had
been
mingled
*NL*
in
my
nightmares
with
that
of
the
one-legged
seafaring
man
.
But
by
this
*NL*
time
we
had
all
long
ceased
to
pay
any
particular
notice
to
the
song
;
it
*NL*
was
new
,
that
night
,
to
nobody
but
Dr.
Livesey
,
and
on
him
I
observed
it
*NL*
did
not
produce
an
agreeable
effect
,
for
he
looked
up
for
a
moment
quite
*NL*
angrily
before
he
went
on
with
his
talk
to
old
Taylor
,
the
gardener
,
on
*NL*
a
new
cure
for
the
rheumatics
.
In
the
meantime
,
the
captain
gradually
*NL*
brightened
up
at
his
own
music
,
and
at
last
flapped
his
hand
upon
*NL*
the
table
before
him
in
a
way
we
all
knew
to
mean
silence
.
The
voices
*NL*
stopped
at
once
,
all
but
Dr.
Livesey
's
;
he
went
on
as
before
speaking
*NL*
clear
and
kind
and
drawing
briskly
at
his
pipe
between
every
word
or
*NL*
two
.
The
captain
glared
at
him
for
a
while
,
flapped
his
hand
again
,
*NL*
glared
still
harder
,
and
at
last
broke
out
with
a
villainous
,
low
oath
,
*NL*
``
Silence
,
there
,
between
decks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
you
addressing
me
,
sir
?
''
says
the
doctor
;
and
when
the
ruffian
had
*NL*
told
him
,
with
another
oath
,
that
this
was
so
,
``
I
have
only
one
thing
to
*NL*
say
to
you
,
sir
,
''
replies
the
doctor
,
``
that
if
you
keep
on
drinking
rum
,
*NL*
the
world
will
soon
be
quit
of
a
very
dirty
scoundrel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
fellow
's
fury
was
awful
.
He
sprang
to
his
feet
,
drew
and
opened
*NL*
a
sailor
's
clasp-knife
,
and
balancing
it
open
on
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
*NL*
threatened
to
pin
the
doctor
to
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
never
so
much
as
moved
.
He
spoke
to
him
as
before
,
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
and
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
,
rather
high
,
so
that
all
the
*NL*
room
might
hear
,
but
perfectly
calm
and
steady
:
``
If
you
do
not
put
that
*NL*
knife
this
instant
in
your
pocket
,
I
promise
,
upon
my
honour
,
you
shall
*NL*
hang
at
the
next
assizes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
followed
a
battle
of
looks
between
them
,
but
the
captain
soon
*NL*
knuckled
under
,
put
up
his
weapon
,
and
resumed
his
seat
,
grumbling
like
*NL*
a
beaten
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
sir
,
''
continued
the
doctor
,
``
since
I
now
know
there
's
such
a
*NL*
fellow
in
my
district
,
you
may
count
I
'll
have
an
eye
upon
you
day
and
*NL*
night
.
I
'm
not
a
doctor
only
;
I
'm
a
magistrate
;
and
if
I
catch
a
breath
*NL*
of
complaint
against
you
,
if
it
's
only
for
a
piece
of
incivility
like
*NL*
tonight
's
,
I
'll
take
effectual
means
to
have
you
hunted
down
and
routed
*NL*
out
of
this
.
Let
that
suffice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
,
Dr.
Livesey
's
horse
came
to
the
door
and
he
rode
away
,
but
*NL*
the
captain
held
his
peace
that
evening
,
and
for
many
evenings
to
come
.

Black

Appears
and
Disappears
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
not
very
long
after
this
that
there
occurred
the
first
of
the
*NL*
mysterious
events
that
rid
us
at
last
of
the
captain
,
though
not
,
as
you
*NL*
will
see
,
of
his
affairs
.
It
was
a
bitter
cold
winter
,
with
long
,
hard
*NL*
frosts
and
heavy
gales
;
and
it
was
plain
from
the
first
that
my
poor
*NL*
father
was
little
likely
to
see
the
spring
.
He
sank
daily
,
and
my
mother
*NL*
and
I
had
all
the
inn
upon
our
hands
,
and
were
kept
busy
enough
without
*NL*
paying
much
regard
to
our
unpleasant
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
January
morning
,
very
early
--
a
pinching
,
frosty
morning
--
the
*NL*
cove
all
grey
with
hoar-frost
,
the
ripple
lapping
softly
on
the
stones
,
*NL*
the
sun
still
low
and
only
touching
the
hilltops
and
shining
far
to
*NL*
seaward
.
The
captain
had
risen
earlier
than
usual
and
set
out
down
the
*NL*
beach
,
his
cutlass
swinging
under
the
broad
skirts
of
the
old
blue
coat
,
*NL*
his
brass
telescope
under
his
arm
,
his
hat
tilted
back
upon
his
head
.
I
*NL*
remember
his
breath
hanging
like
smoke
in
his
wake
as
he
strode
off
,
and
*NL*
the
last
sound
I
heard
of
him
as
he
turned
the
big
rock
was
a
loud
snort
*NL*
of
indignation
,
as
though
his
mind
was
still
running
upon
Dr.
Livesey
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
mother
was
upstairs
with
father
and
I
was
laying
the
*NL*
breakfast-table
against
the
captain
's
return
when
the
parlour
door
*NL*
opened
and
a
man
stepped
in
on
whom
I
had
never
set
my
eyes
before
.
He
*NL*
was
a
pale
,
tallowy
creature
,
wanting
two
fingers
of
the
left
hand
,
and
*NL*
though
he
wore
a
cutlass
,
he
did
not
look
much
like
a
fighter
.
I
*NL*
had
always
my
eye
open
for
seafaring
men
,
with
one
leg
or
two
,
and
I
*NL*
remember
this
one
puzzled
me
.
He
was
not
sailorly
,
and
yet
he
had
a
*NL*
smack
of
the
sea
about
him
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
asked
him
what
was
for
his
service
,
and
he
said
he
would
take
rum
;
but
*NL*
as
I
was
going
out
of
the
room
to
fetch
it
,
he
sat
down
upon
a
table
*NL*
and
motioned
me
to
draw
near
.
I
paused
where
I
was
,
with
my
napkin
in
my
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
here
,
sonny
,
''
says
he
.
``
Come
nearer
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
a
step
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
here
table
for
my
mate
Bill
?
''
he
asked
with
a
kind
of
leer
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
I
did
not
know
his
mate
Bill
,
and
this
was
for
a
person
who
*NL*
stayed
in
our
house
whom
we
called
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
my
mate
Bill
would
be
called
the
captain
,
as
like
*NL*
as
not
.
He
has
a
cut
on
one
cheek
and
a
mighty
pleasant
way
with
him
,
*NL*
particularly
in
drink
,
has
my
mate
Bill
.
We
'll
put
it
,
for
argument
*NL*
like
,
that
your
captain
has
a
cut
on
one
cheek
--
and
we
'll
put
it
,
if
you
*NL*
like
,
that
that
cheek
's
the
right
one
.
Ah
,
well
!
I
told
you
.
Now
,
is
my
*NL*
mate
Bill
in
this
here
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
he
was
out
walking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
way
,
sonny
?
Which
way
is
he
gone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
I
had
pointed
out
the
rock
and
told
him
how
the
captain
was
*NL*
likely
to
return
,
and
how
soon
,
and
answered
a
few
other
questions
,
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
he
,
``
this
'll
be
as
good
as
drink
to
my
mate
Bill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
expression
of
his
face
as
he
said
these
words
was
not
at
all
*NL*
pleasant
,
and
I
had
my
own
reasons
for
thinking
that
the
stranger
was
*NL*
mistaken
,
even
supposing
he
meant
what
he
said
.
But
it
was
no
affair
of
*NL*
mine
,
I
thought
;
and
besides
,
it
was
difficult
to
know
what
to
do
.
The
*NL*
stranger
kept
hanging
about
just
inside
the
inn
door
,
peering
round
the
*NL*
corner
like
a
cat
waiting
for
a
mouse
.
Once
I
stepped
out
myself
into
*NL*
the
road
,
but
he
immediately
called
me
back
,
and
as
I
did
not
obey
quick
*NL*
enough
for
his
fancy
,
a
most
horrible
change
came
over
his
tallowy
face
,
*NL*
and
he
ordered
me
in
with
an
oath
that
made
me
jump
.
As
soon
as
I
*NL*
was
back
again
he
returned
to
his
former
manner
,
half
fawning
,
half
*NL*
sneering
,
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
,
told
me
I
was
a
good
boy
and
he
had
*NL*
taken
quite
a
fancy
to
me
.
``
I
have
a
son
of
my
own
,
''
said
he
,
``
as
like
*NL*
you
as
two
blocks
,
and
he
's
all
the
pride
of
my
`
art
.
But
the
great
*NL*
thing
for
boys
is
discipline
,
sonny
--
discipline
.
Now
,
if
you
had
sailed
*NL*
along
of
Bill
,
you
would
n't
have
stood
there
to
be
spoke
to
twice
--
not
*NL*
you
.
That
was
never
Bill
's
way
,
nor
the
way
of
sich
as
sailed
with
him
.
*NL*
And
here
,
sure
enough
,
is
my
mate
Bill
,
with
a
spy-glass
under
his
arm
,
*NL*
bless
his
old
`
art
,
to
be
sure
.
You
and
me
'll
just
go
back
into
the
*NL*
parlour
,
sonny
,
and
get
behind
the
door
,
and
we
'll
give
Bill
a
little
*NL*
surprise
--
bless
his
`
art
,
I
say
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
stranger
backed
along
with
me
into
the
parlour
and
put
me
*NL*
behind
him
in
the
corner
so
that
we
were
both
hidden
by
the
open
door
.
I
*NL*
was
very
uneasy
and
alarmed
,
as
you
may
fancy
,
and
it
rather
added
to
my
*NL*
fears
to
observe
that
the
stranger
was
certainly
frightened
himself
.
He
*NL*
cleared
the
hilt
of
his
cutlass
and
loosened
the
blade
in
the
sheath
;
*NL*
and
all
the
time
we
were
waiting
there
he
kept
swallowing
as
if
he
felt
*NL*
what
we
used
to
call
a
lump
in
the
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
in
strode
the
captain
,
slammed
the
door
behind
him
,
without
*NL*
looking
to
the
right
or
left
,
and
marched
straight
across
the
room
to
*NL*
where
his
breakfast
awaited
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bill
,
''
said
the
stranger
in
a
voice
that
I
thought
he
had
tried
to
make
*NL*
bold
and
big
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
spun
round
on
his
heel
and
fronted
us
;
all
the
brown
had
*NL*
gone
out
of
his
face
,
and
even
his
nose
was
blue
;
he
had
the
look
of
a
*NL*
man
who
sees
a
ghost
,
or
the
evil
one
,
or
something
worse
,
if
anything
*NL*
can
be
;
and
upon
my
word
,
I
felt
sorry
to
see
him
all
in
a
moment
turn
*NL*
so
old
and
sick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Bill
,
you
know
me
;
you
know
an
old
shipmate
,
Bill
,
surely
,
''
said
*NL*
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
made
a
sort
of
gasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Black
Dog
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
else
?
''
returned
the
other
,
getting
more
at
his
ease
.
``
Black
*NL*
Dog
as
ever
was
,
come
for
to
see
his
old
shipmate
Billy
,
at
the
Admiral
*NL*
Benbow
inn
.
Ah
,
Bill
,
Bill
,
we
have
seen
a
sight
of
times
,
us
two
,
since
*NL*
I
lost
them
two
talons
,
''
holding
up
his
mutilated
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
look
here
,
''
said
the
captain
;
``
you
've
run
me
down
;
here
I
am
;
*NL*
well
,
then
,
speak
up
;
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
you
,
Bill
,
''
returned
Black
Dog
,
``
you
're
in
the
right
of
it
,
*NL*
Billy
.
I
'll
have
a
glass
of
rum
from
this
dear
child
here
,
as
I
've
took
*NL*
such
a
liking
to
;
and
we
'll
sit
down
,
if
you
please
,
and
talk
square
,
*NL*
like
old
shipmates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
returned
with
the
rum
,
they
were
already
seated
on
either
side
*NL*
of
the
captain
's
breakfast-table
--
Black
Dog
next
to
the
door
and
*NL*
sitting
sideways
so
as
to
have
one
eye
on
his
old
shipmate
and
one
,
as
I
*NL*
thought
,
on
his
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bade
me
go
and
leave
the
door
wide
open
.
``
None
of
your
keyholes
for
*NL*
me
,
sonny
,
''
he
said
;
and
I
left
them
together
and
retired
into
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
,
though
I
certainly
did
my
best
to
listen
,
I
could
hear
*NL*
nothing
but
a
low
gattling
;
but
at
last
the
voices
began
to
grow
higher
,
*NL*
and
I
could
pick
up
a
word
or
two
,
mostly
oaths
,
from
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
no
;
and
an
end
of
it
!
''
he
cried
once
.
And
again
,
``
If
it
*NL*
comes
to
swinging
,
swing
all
,
say
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
tremendous
explosion
of
oaths
and
*NL*
other
noises
--
the
chair
and
table
went
over
in
a
lump
,
a
clash
of
steel
*NL*
followed
,
and
then
a
cry
of
pain
,
and
the
next
instant
I
saw
Black
*NL*
Dog
in
full
flight
,
and
the
captain
hotly
pursuing
,
both
with
drawn
*NL*
cutlasses
,
and
the
former
streaming
blood
from
the
left
shoulder
.
Just
*NL*
at
the
door
the
captain
aimed
at
the
fugitive
one
last
tremendous
*NL*
cut
,
which
would
certainly
have
split
him
to
the
chine
had
it
not
been
*NL*
intercepted
by
our
big
signboard
of
Admiral
Benbow
.
You
may
see
the
*NL*
notch
on
the
lower
side
of
the
frame
to
this
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
blow
was
the
last
of
the
battle
.
Once
out
upon
the
road
,
Black
*NL*
Dog
,
in
spite
of
his
wound
,
showed
a
wonderful
clean
pair
of
heels
and
*NL*
disappeared
over
the
edge
of
the
hill
in
half
a
minute
.
The
captain
,
for
*NL*
his
part
,
stood
staring
at
the
signboard
like
a
bewildered
man
.
Then
he
*NL*
passed
his
hand
over
his
eyes
several
times
and
at
last
turned
back
into
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
,
''
says
he
,
``
rum
''
;
and
as
he
spoke
,
he
reeled
a
little
,
and
caught
*NL*
himself
with
one
hand
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
hurt
?
''
cried
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rum
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
I
must
get
away
from
here
.
Rum
!
Rum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
ran
to
fetch
it
,
but
I
was
quite
unsteadied
by
all
that
had
fallen
*NL*
out
,
and
I
broke
one
glass
and
fouled
the
tap
,
and
while
I
was
still
*NL*
getting
in
my
own
way
,
I
heard
a
loud
fall
in
the
parlour
,
and
running
*NL*
in
,
beheld
the
captain
lying
full
length
upon
the
floor
.
At
the
same
*NL*
instant
my
mother
,
alarmed
by
the
cries
and
fighting
,
came
running
*NL*
downstairs
to
help
me
.
Between
us
we
raised
his
head
.
He
was
breathing
*NL*
very
loud
and
hard
,
but
his
eyes
were
closed
and
his
face
a
horrible
*NL*
colour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
deary
me
,
''
cried
my
mother
,
``
what
a
disgrace
upon
the
house
!
And
*NL*
your
poor
father
sick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
we
had
no
idea
what
to
do
to
help
the
captain
,
nor
any
*NL*
other
thought
but
that
he
had
got
his
death-hurt
in
the
scuffle
with
*NL*
the
stranger
.
I
got
the
rum
,
to
be
sure
,
and
tried
to
put
it
down
his
*NL*
throat
,
but
his
teeth
were
tightly
shut
and
his
jaws
as
strong
as
iron
.
*NL*
It
was
a
happy
relief
for
us
when
the
door
opened
and
Doctor
Livesey
*NL*
came
in
,
on
his
visit
to
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
doctor
,
''
we
cried
,
``
what
shall
we
do
?
Where
is
he
wounded
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wounded
?
A
fiddle-stick
's
end
!
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
No
more
wounded
than
*NL*
you
or
I
.
The
man
has
had
a
stroke
,
as
I
warned
him
.
Now
,
Mrs.
Hawkins
,
*NL*
just
you
run
upstairs
to
your
husband
and
tell
him
,
if
possible
,
nothing
*NL*
about
it
.
For
my
part
,
I
must
do
my
best
to
save
this
fellow
's
trebly
*NL*
worthless
life
;
Jim
,
you
get
me
a
basin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
got
back
with
the
basin
,
the
doctor
had
already
ripped
up
the
*NL*
captain
's
sleeve
and
exposed
his
great
sinewy
arm
.
It
was
tattooed
*NL*
in
several
places
.
``
Here
's
luck
,
''
``
A
fair
wind
,
''
and
``
Billy
Bones
his
*NL*
fancy
,
''
were
very
neatly
and
clearly
executed
on
the
forearm
;
and
up
*NL*
near
the
shoulder
there
was
a
sketch
of
a
gallows
and
a
man
hanging
from
*NL*
it
--
done
,
as
I
thought
,
with
great
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prophetic
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
touching
this
picture
with
his
finger
.
*NL*
``
And
now
,
Master
Billy
Bones
,
if
that
be
your
name
,
we
'll
have
a
look
at
*NL*
the
colour
of
your
blood
.
Jim
,
''
he
said
,
``
are
you
afraid
of
blood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
hold
the
basin
''
;
and
with
that
he
took
his
*NL*
lancet
and
opened
a
vein
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
deal
of
blood
was
taken
before
the
captain
opened
his
eyes
*NL*
and
looked
mistily
about
him
.
First
he
recognized
the
doctor
with
*NL*
an
unmistakable
frown
;
then
his
glance
fell
upon
me
,
and
he
looked
*NL*
relieved
.
But
suddenly
his
colour
changed
,
and
he
tried
to
raise
*NL*
himself
,
crying
,
``
Where
's
Black
Dog
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
Black
Dog
here
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
except
what
you
have
*NL*
on
your
own
back
.
You
have
been
drinking
rum
;
you
have
had
a
stroke
,
*NL*
precisely
as
I
told
you
;
and
I
have
just
,
very
much
against
my
own
will
,
*NL*
dragged
you
headforemost
out
of
the
grave
.
Now
,
Mr.
Bones
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
my
name
,
''
he
interrupted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
I
care
,
''
returned
the
doctor
.
``
It
's
the
name
of
a
buccaneer
of
my
*NL*
acquaintance
;
and
I
call
you
by
it
for
the
sake
of
shortness
,
and
what
I
*NL*
have
to
say
to
you
is
this
;
one
glass
of
rum
wo
n't
kill
you
,
but
if
*NL*
you
take
one
you
'll
take
another
and
another
,
and
I
stake
my
wig
if
you
*NL*
do
n't
break
off
short
,
you
'll
die
--
do
you
understand
that
?
--
die
,
and
go
*NL*
to
your
own
place
,
like
the
man
in
the
Bible
.
Come
,
now
,
make
an
effort
.
*NL*
I
'll
help
you
to
your
bed
for
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Between
us
,
with
much
trouble
,
we
managed
to
hoist
him
upstairs
,
and
*NL*
laid
him
on
his
bed
,
where
his
head
fell
back
on
the
pillow
as
if
he
*NL*
were
almost
fainting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
mind
you
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
I
clear
my
conscience
--
the
name
of
*NL*
rum
for
you
is
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
he
went
off
to
see
my
father
,
taking
me
with
him
by
the
*NL*
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
nothing
,
''
he
said
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
door
.
``
I
have
*NL*
drawn
blood
enough
to
keep
him
quiet
awhile
;
he
should
lie
for
a
week
*NL*
where
he
is
--
that
is
the
best
thing
for
him
and
you
;
but
another
stroke
*NL*
would
settle
him
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
Black
Spot
*NL*
*NL*
ABOUT
noon
I
stopped
at
the
captain
's
door
with
some
cooling
drinks
*NL*
and
medicines
.
He
was
lying
very
much
as
we
had
left
him
,
only
a
little
*NL*
higher
,
and
he
seemed
both
weak
and
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
're
the
only
one
here
that
's
worth
anything
,
and
you
*NL*
know
I
've
been
always
good
to
you
.
Never
a
month
but
I
've
given
you
a
*NL*
silver
fourpenny
for
yourself
.
And
now
you
see
,
mate
,
I
'm
pretty
low
,
*NL*
and
deserted
by
all
;
and
Jim
,
you
'll
bring
me
one
noggin
of
rum
,
now

*NL*
wo
n't
you

matey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
--
''
I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
broke
in
cursing
the
doctor
,
in
a
feeble
voice
but
heartily
.
*NL*
``
Doctors
is
all
swabs
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
that
doctor
there
,
why
,
what
do
*NL*
he
know
about
seafaring
men
?
I
been
in
places
hot
as
pitch
,
and
mates
*NL*
dropping
round
with
Yellow
Jack
,
and
the
blessed
land
a-heaving
like
the
*NL*
sea
with
earthquakes

what
to
the
doctor
know
of
lands
like
that

I
*NL*
lived
on
rum

I
tell
you

It

been
meat

man

to
me

and
if
I
'm
not
to
have
my
rum
now
I
'm
a
poor
old
hulk
on
a
lee
*NL*
shore
,
my
blood
'll
be
on
you
,
Jim
,
and
that
doctor
swab
''
;
and
he
ran
on
*NL*
again
for
a
while
with
curses
.
``
Look
,
Jim
,
how
my
fingers
fidges
,
''
*NL*
he
continued
in
the
pleading
tone
.
``
I
ca
n't
keep
'em
still

not
I.
I
*NL*
have
n't

a

If
I
do

a
drain

rum

Jim

I
'll
have
the
horrors

on

corner

I
'm
a
man

has
lived
rough

I
'll
raise
Cain

Your

hisself
said
one
glass
*NL*
would
n't
hurt
me
.
I
'll
give
you
a
golden
guinea
for
a
noggin

Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
growing
more
and
more
excited
,
and
this
alarmed
me
for
my
father
,
*NL*
who
was
very
low
that
day
and
needed
quiet
;
besides
,
I
was
reassured
by
*NL*
the
doctor
's
words
,
now
quoted
to
me
,
and
rather
offended
by
the
offer
*NL*
of
a
bribe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
none
of
your
money

said
I
,
``

my

I
'll

get
you
one
glass

no

*NL*
*NL*
When
I
brought
it
to
him
,
he
seized
it
greedily
and
drank
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye

said
he
,
``
that
's
some
better

sure
enough

And
now

matey

*NL*
did
that
doctor
say
how
long
I
was
to
lie
here
in
this
old
berth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
week
at
least

''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thunder

he
cried
.
``
A
week

I
ca
n't
do
that

they
'd
have
the
black
*NL*
spot
on
me
by
then

The
lubbers
is
going
about
to
get
the
wind
of
me
*NL*
this
blessed
moment

lubbers
as
could
n't

want

that

I

another

*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
thus
speaking
,
he
had
risen
from
bed
with
great
difficulty
,
*NL*
holding
to
my
shoulder
with
a
grip
that
almost
made
me
cry
out
,
and
*NL*
moving
his
legs
like
so
much
dead
weight
.
His
words
,
spirited
as
they
*NL*
were
in
meaning
,
contrasted
sadly
with
the
weakness
of
the
voice
in
*NL*
which
they
were
uttered
.
He
paused
when
he
had
got
into
a
sitting
*NL*
position
on
the
edge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
doctor
's
done
me

he
murmured

``
My
ears

singing

Lay
me
back

*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
could
do
much
to
help
him
he
had
fallen
back
again
to
his
*NL*
former
place
,
where
he
lay
for
a
while
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim

he
said
at
length
,
``
you
saw
that
seafaring

today

*NL*
*NL*
``

Dog

I
asked

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

says
he

``

Now

,
I
was
,
old
Flint
's
first
mate
,
and
I
'm
the
on
'
y
one
as
knows
*NL*
the
place
.
He
gave
it
me
at
Savannah
,
when
he
lay
a-dying
,
like
as
if
I
*NL*
was
to
now
,
you
see
.
But
you
wo
n't
peach
unless
they
get
the
black
spot
*NL*
on
me
,
or
unless
you
see
that
Black
Dog
again
or
a
seafaring
man
with
*NL*
one
leg
,
Jim
--
him
above
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
is
the
black
spot
,
captain
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
summons
,
mate
.
I
'll
tell
you
if
they
get
that
.
But
you
keep
*NL*
your
weather-eye
open
,
Jim
,
and
I
'll
share
with
you
equals
,
upon
my
*NL*
honour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wandered
a
little
longer
,
his
voice
growing
weaker
;
but
soon
after
I
*NL*
had
given
him
his
medicine
,
which
he
took
like
a
child
,
with
the
remark
,
*NL*
``
If
ever
a
seaman
wanted
drugs
,
it
's
me
,
''
he
fell
at
last
into
a
heavy
,
*NL*
swoon-like
sleep
,
in
which
I
left
him
.
What
I
should
have
done
had
all
*NL*
gone
well
I
do
not
know
.
Probably
I
should
have
told
the
whole
story
to
*NL*
the
doctor
,
for
I
was
in
mortal
fear
lest
the
captain
should
repent
of
*NL*
his
confessions
and
make
an
end
of
me
.
But
as
things
fell
out
,
my
poor
*NL*
father
died
quite
suddenly
that
evening
,
which
put
all
other
matters
*NL*
on
one
side
.
Our
natural
distress
,
the
visits
of
the
neighbours
,
the
*NL*
arranging
of
the
funeral
,
and
all
the
work
of
the
inn
to
be
carried
on
*NL*
in
the
meanwhile
kept
me
so
busy
that
I
had
scarcely
time
to
think
of
*NL*
the
captain
,
far
less
to
be
afraid
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
downstairs
next
morning
,
to
be
sure
,
and
had
his
meals
as
usual
,
*NL*
though
he
ate
little
and
had
more
,
I
am
afraid
,
than
his
usual
supply
of
*NL*
rum
,
for
he
helped
himself
out
of
the
bar
,
scowling
and
blowing
through
*NL*
his
nose
,
and
no
one
dared
to
cross
him
.
On
the
night
before
the
funeral
*NL*
he
was
as
drunk
as
ever
;
and
it
was
shocking
,
in
that
house
of
mourning
,
*NL*
to
hear
him
singing
away
at
his
ugly
old
sea-song
;
but
weak
as
he
was
,
*NL*
we
were
all
in
the
fear
of
death
for
him
,
and
the
doctor
was
suddenly
*NL*
taken
up
with
a
case
many
miles
away
and
was
never
near
the
house
after
*NL*
my
father
's
death
.
I
have
said
the
captain
was
weak
,
and
indeed
he
*NL*
seemed
rather
to
grow
weaker
than
regain
his
strength
.
He
clambered
up
*NL*
and
down
stairs
,
and
went
from
the
parlour
to
the
bar
and
back
again
,
*NL*
and
sometimes
put
his
nose
out
of
doors
to
smell
the
sea
,
holding
on
to
*NL*
the
walls
as
he
went
for
support
and
breathing
hard
and
fast
like
a
man
*NL*
on
a
steep
mountain
.
He
never
particularly
addressed
me
,
and
it
is
my
*NL*
belief
he
had
as
good
as
forgotten
his
confidences
;
but
his
temper
was
*NL*
more
flighty
,
and
allowing
for
his
bodily
weakness
,
more
violent
than
*NL*
ever
.
He
had
an
alarming
way
now
when
he
was
drunk
of
drawing
his
*NL*
cutlass
and
laying
it
bare
before
him
on
the
table
.
But
with
all
that
,
*NL*
he
minded
people
less
and
seemed
shut
up
in
his
own
thoughts
and
rather
*NL*
wandering
.
Once
,
for
instance
,
to
our
extreme
wonder
,
he
piped
up
to
a
*NL*
different
air
,
a
kind
of
country
love-song
that
he
must
have
learned
in
*NL*
his
youth
before
he
had
begun
to
follow
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
things
passed
until
,
the
day
after
the
funeral
,
and
about
three
*NL*
o'clock
of
a
bitter
,
foggy
,
frosty
afternoon
,
I
was
standing
at
the
door
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
full
of
sad
thoughts
about
my
father
,
when
I
saw
someone
*NL*
drawing
slowly
near
along
the
road
.
He
was
plainly
blind
,
for
he
tapped
*NL*
before
him
with
a
stick
and
wore
a
great
green
shade
over
his
eyes
and
*NL*
nose
;
and
he
was
hunched
,
as
if
with
age
or
weakness
,
and
wore
a
huge
*NL*
old
tattered
sea-cloak
with
a
hood
that
made
him
appear
positively
*NL*
deformed
.
I
never
saw
in
my
life
a
more
dreadful-looking
figure
.
*NL*
He
stopped
a
little
from
the
inn
,
and
raising
his
voice
in
an
odd
*NL*
sing-song
,
addressed
the
air
in
front
of
him
,
``
Will
any
kind
friend
*NL*
inform
a
poor
blind
man
,
who
has
lost
the
precious
sight
of
his
eyes
in
*NL*
the
gracious
defence
of
his
native
country
,
England
--
and
God
bless
King
*NL*
George
!
--
where
or
in
what
part
of
this
country
he
may
now
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
at
the
Admiral
Benbow
,
Black
Hill
Cove
,
my
good
man
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
a
voice
,
''
said
he
,
``
a
young
voice
.
Will
you
give
me
your
hand
,
*NL*
my
kind
young
friend
,
and
lead
me
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
held
out
my
hand
,
and
the
horrible
,
soft-spoken
,
eyeless
creature
*NL*
gripped
it
in
a
moment
like
a
vise
.
I
was
so
much
startled
that
I
*NL*
struggled
to
withdraw
,
but
the
blind
man
pulled
me
close
up
to
him
with
*NL*
a
single
action
of
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
boy
,
''
he
said
,
``
take
me
in
to
the
captain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
upon
my
word
I
dare
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
he
sneered
,
``
that
's
it
!
Take
me
in
straight
or
I
'll
break
your
*NL*
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
gave
it
,
as
he
spoke
,
a
wrench
that
made
me
cry
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
I
,
``
it
is
for
yourself
I
mean
.
The
captain
is
not
what
he
*NL*
used
to
be
.
He
sits
with
a
drawn
cutlass
.
Another
gentleman
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
,
march
,
''
interrupted
he
;
and
I
never
heard
a
voice
so
cruel
,
*NL*
and
cold
,
and
ugly
as
that
blind
man
's
.
It
cowed
me
more
than
the
pain
,
*NL*
and
I
began
to
obey
him
at
once
,
walking
straight
in
at
the
door
and
*NL*
towards
the
parlour
,
where
our
sick
old
buccaneer
was
sitting
,
dazed
*NL*
with
rum
.
The
blind
man
clung
close
to
me
,
holding
me
in
one
iron
fist
*NL*
and
leaning
almost
more
of
his
weight
on
me
than
I
could
carry
.
``
Lead
me
*NL*
straight
up
to
him
,
and
when
I
'm
in
view
,
cry
out
,
`
Here
's
a
friend
*NL*
for
you
,
Bill
.
'
If
you
do
n't
,
I
'll
do
this
,
''
and
with
that
he
gave
me
a
*NL*
twitch
that
I
thought
would
have
made
me
faint
.
Between
this
and
that
,
I
*NL*
was
so
utterly
terrified
of
the
blind
beggar
that
I
forgot
my
terror
of
*NL*
the
captain
,
and
as
I
opened
the
parlour
door
,
cried
out
the
words
he
*NL*
had
ordered
in
a
trembling
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
captain
raised
his
eyes
,
and
at
one
look
the
rum
went
out
of
*NL*
him
and
left
him
staring
sober
.
The
expression
of
his
face
was
not
so
*NL*
much
of
terror
as
of
mortal
sickness
.
He
made
a
movement
to
rise
,
but
I
*NL*
do
not
believe
he
had
enough
force
left
in
his
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Bill
,
sit
where
you
are
,
''
said
the
beggar
.
``
If
I
ca
n't
see
,
I
can
*NL*
hear
a
finger
stirring
.
Business
is
business
.
Hold
out
your
left
hand
.
*NL*
Boy
,
take
his
left
hand
by
the
wrist
and
bring
it
near
to
my
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
both
obeyed
him
to
the
letter
,
and
I
saw
him
pass
something
from
the
*NL*
hollow
of
the
hand
that
held
his
stick
into
the
palm
of
the
captain
's
,
*NL*
which
closed
upon
it
instantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
that
's
done
,
''
said
the
blind
man
;
and
at
the
words
he
suddenly
*NL*
left
hold
of
me
,
and
with
incredible
accuracy
and
nimbleness
,
*NL*
skipped
out
of
the
parlour
and
into
the
road
,
where
,
as
I
still
stood
*NL*
motionless
,
I
could
hear
his
stick
go
tap-tap-tapping
into
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
time
before
either
I
or
the
captain
seemed
to
gather
our
*NL*
senses
,
but
at
length
,
and
about
at
the
same
moment
,
I
released
his
*NL*
wrist
,
which
I
was
still
holding
,
and
he
drew
in
his
hand
and
looked
*NL*
sharply
into
the
palm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
o'clock
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Six
hours
.
We
'll
do
them
yet
,
''
and
he
sprang
*NL*
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
as
he
did
so
,
he
reeled
,
put
his
hand
to
his
throat
,
stood
swaying
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
and
then
,
with
a
peculiar
sound
,
fell
from
his
whole
*NL*
height
face
foremost
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
ran
to
him
at
once
,
calling
to
my
mother
.
But
haste
was
all
in
vain
.
*NL*
The
captain
had
been
struck
dead
by
thundering
apoplexy
.
It
is
a
curious
*NL*
thing
to
understand
,
for
I
had
certainly
never
liked
the
man
,
though
of
*NL*
late
I
had
begun
to
pity
him
,
but
as
soon
as
I
saw
that
he
was
dead
,
I
*NL*
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
It
was
the
second
death
I
had
known
,
and
*NL*
the
sorrow
of
the
first
was
still
fresh
in
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
4
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sea-chest
*NL*
*NL*
I
LOST
no
time
,
of
course
,
in
telling
my
mother
all
that
I
knew
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
should
have
told
her
long
before
,
and
we
saw
ourselves
at
once
*NL*
in
a
difficult
and
dangerous
position
.
Some
of
the
man
's
money
--
if
*NL*
he
had
any
--
was
certainly
due
to
us
,
but
it
was
not
likely
that
our
*NL*
captain
's
shipmates
,
above
all
the
two
specimens
seen
by
me
,
Black
*NL*
Dog
and
the
blind
beggar
,
would
be
inclined
to
give
up
their
booty
in
*NL*
payment
of
the
dead
man
's
debts
.
The
captain
's
order
to
mount
at
*NL*
once
and
ride
for
Doctor
Livesey
would
have
left
my
mother
alone
*NL*
and
unprotected
,
which
was
not
to
be
thought
of
.
Indeed
,
it
seemed
*NL*
impossible
for
either
of
us
to
remain
much
longer
in
the
house
;
the
fall
*NL*
of
coals
in
the
kitchen
grate
,
the
very
ticking
of
the
clock
,
filled
*NL*
us
with
alarms
.
The
neighbourhood
,
to
our
ears
,
seemed
haunted
by
*NL*
approaching
footsteps
;
and
what
between
the
dead
body
of
the
captain
*NL*
on
the
parlour
floor
and
the
thought
of
that
detestable
blind
beggar
*NL*
hovering
near
at
hand
and
ready
to
return
,
there
were
moments
when
,
as
*NL*
the
saying
goes
,
I
jumped
in
my
skin
for
terror
.
Something
must
speedily
*NL*
be
resolved
upon
,
and
it
occurred
to
us
at
last
to
go
forth
together
*NL*
and
seek
help
in
the
neighbouring
hamlet
.
No
sooner
said
than
done
.
*NL*
Bare-headed
as
we
were
,
we
ran
out
at
once
in
the
gathering
evening
and
*NL*
the
frosty
fog
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hamlet
lay
not
many
hundred
yards
away
,
though
out
of
view
,
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
next
cove
;
and
what
greatly
encouraged
me
,
it
was
*NL*
in
an
opposite
direction
from
that
whence
the
blind
man
had
made
his
*NL*
appearance
and
whither
he
had
presumably
returned
.
We
were
not
many
*NL*
minutes
on
the
road
,
though
we
sometimes
stopped
to
lay
hold
of
each
*NL*
other
and
hearken
.
But
there
was
no
unusual
sound
--
nothing
but
the
low
*NL*
wash
of
the
ripple
and
the
croaking
of
the
inmates
of
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
already
candle-light
when
we
reached
the
hamlet
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
never
forget
how
much
I
was
cheered
to
see
the
yellow
shine
in
doors
and
*NL*
windows
;
but
that
,
as
it
proved
,
was
the
best
of
the
help
we
were
likely
*NL*
to
get
in
that
quarter
.
For
--
you
would
have
thought
men
would
have
been
*NL*
ashamed
of
themselves
--
no
soul
would
consent
to
return
with
us
to
the
*NL*
Admiral
Benbow
.
The
more
we
told
of
our
troubles
,
the
more
--
man
,
woman
,
*NL*
and
child
--
they
clung
to
the
shelter
of
their
houses
.
The
name
of
*NL*
Captain
Flint
,
though
it
was
strange
to
me
,
was
well
enough
known
to
*NL*
some
there
and
carried
a
great
weight
of
terror
.
Some
of
the
men
who
*NL*
had
been
to
field-work
on
the
far
side
of
the
Admiral
Benbow
remembered
,
*NL*
besides
,
to
have
seen
several
strangers
on
the
road
,
and
taking
them
to
*NL*
be
smugglers
,
to
have
bolted
away
;
and
one
at
least
had
seen
a
little
*NL*
lugger
in
what
we
called
Kitt
's
Hole
.
For
that
matter
,
anyone
who
was
a
*NL*
comrade
of
the
captain
's
was
enough
to
frighten
them
to
death
.
And
the
*NL*
short
and
the
long
of
the
matter
was
,
that
while
we
could
get
several
*NL*
who
were
willing
enough
to
ride
to
Dr.
Livesey
's
,
which
lay
in
another
*NL*
direction
,
not
one
would
help
us
to
defend
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
say
cowardice
is
infectious
;
but
then
argument
is
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
a
great
emboldener
;
and
so
when
each
had
said
his
say
,
my
mother
*NL*
made
them
a
speech
.
She
would
not
,
she
declared
,
lose
money
that
*NL*
belonged
to
her
fatherless
boy
;
``
If
none
of
the
rest
of
you
dare
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
``
Jim
and
I
dare
.
Back
we
will
go
,
the
way
we
came
,
and
small
*NL*
thanks
to
you
big
,
hulking
,
chicken-hearted
men
.
We
'll
have
that
chest
*NL*
open
,
if
we
die
for
it
.
And
I
'll
thank
you
for
that
bag
,
Mrs.
Crossley
,
*NL*
to
bring
back
our
lawful
money
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
I
said
I
would
go
with
my
mother
,
and
of
course
they
all
cried
*NL*
out
at
our
foolhardiness
,
but
even
then
not
a
man
would
go
along
with
*NL*
us
.
All
they
would
do
was
to
give
me
a
loaded
pistol
lest
we
were
*NL*
attacked
,
and
to
promise
to
have
horses
ready
saddled
in
case
we
were
*NL*
pursued
on
our
return
,
while
one
lad
was
to
ride
forward
to
the
doctor
's
*NL*
in
search
of
armed
assistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
heart
was
beating
finely
when
we
two
set
forth
in
the
cold
night
upon
*NL*
this
dangerous
venture
.
A
full
moon
was
beginning
to
rise
and
peered
*NL*
redly
through
the
upper
edges
of
the
fog
,
and
this
increased
our
haste
,
*NL*
for
it
was
plain
,
before
we
came
forth
again
,
that
all
would
be
as
*NL*
bright
as
day
,
and
our
departure
exposed
to
the
eyes
of
any
watchers
.
*NL*
We
slipped
along
the
hedges
,
noiseless
and
swift
,
nor
did
we
see
or
hear
*NL*
anything
to
increase
our
terrors
,
till
,
to
our
relief
,
the
door
of
the
*NL*
Admiral
Benbow
had
closed
behind
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
slipped
the
bolt
at
once
,
and
we
stood
and
panted
for
a
moment
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
alone
in
the
house
with
the
dead
captain
's
body
.
Then
my
mother
*NL*
got
a
candle
in
the
bar
,
and
holding
each
other
's
hands
,
we
advanced
*NL*
into
the
parlour
.
He
lay
as
we
had
left
him
,
on
his
back
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
open
and
one
arm
stretched
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Draw
down
the
blind
,
Jim
,
''
whispered
my
mother
;
``
they
might
come
and
*NL*
watch
outside
.
And
now
,
''
said
she
when
I
had
done
so
,
``
we
have
to
get
*NL*
the
key
off
THAT
;
and
who
's
to
touch
it
,
I
should
like
to
know
!
''
and
she
*NL*
gave
a
kind
of
sob
as
she
said
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
down
on
my
knees
at
once
.
On
the
floor
close
to
his
hand
there
*NL*
was
a
little
round
of
paper
,
blackened
on
the
one
side
.
I
could
not
*NL*
doubt
that
this
was
the
BLACK
SPOT
;
and
taking
it
up
,
I
found
written
*NL*
on
the
other
side
,
in
a
very
good
,
clear
hand
,
this
short
message
:
``
You
*NL*
have
till
ten
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
till
ten
,
Mother
,
''
said
I
;
and
just
as
I
said
it
,
our
old
clock
*NL*
began
striking
.
This
sudden
noise
startled
us
shockingly
;
but
the
news
*NL*
was
good
,
for
it
was
only
six
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Jim
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
felt
in
his
pockets
,
one
after
another
.
A
few
small
coins
,
a
thimble
,
*NL*
and
some
thread
and
big
needles
,
a
piece
of
pigtail
tobacco
bitten
away
*NL*
at
the
end
,
his
gully
with
the
crooked
handle
,
a
pocket
compass
,
and
a
*NL*
tinder
box
were
all
that
they
contained
,
and
I
began
to
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
's
round
his
neck
,
''
suggested
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Overcoming
a
strong
repugnance
,
I
tore
open
his
shirt
at
the
neck
,
and
*NL*
there
,
sure
enough
,
hanging
to
a
bit
of
tarry
string
,
which
I
cut
with
*NL*
his
own
gully
,
we
found
the
key
.
At
this
triumph
we
were
filled
with
*NL*
hope
and
hurried
upstairs
without
delay
to
the
little
room
where
he
had
*NL*
slept
so
long
and
where
his
box
had
stood
since
the
day
of
his
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
any
other
seaman
's
chest
on
the
outside
,
the
initial
``
B
''
*NL*
burned
on
the
top
of
it
with
a
hot
iron
,
and
the
corners
somewhat
*NL*
smashed
and
broken
as
by
long
,
rough
usage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
the
key
,
''
said
my
mother
;
and
though
the
lock
was
very
stiff
,
*NL*
she
had
turned
it
and
thrown
back
the
lid
in
a
twinkling
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strong
smell
of
tobacco
and
tar
rose
from
the
interior
,
but
nothing
*NL*
was
to
be
seen
on
the
top
except
a
suit
of
very
good
clothes
,
carefully
*NL*
brushed
and
folded
.
They
had
never
been
worn
,
my
mother
said
.
Under
*NL*
that
,
the
miscellany
began
--
a
quadrant
,
a
tin
canikin
,
several
sticks
of
*NL*
tobacco
,
two
brace
of
very
handsome
pistols
,
a
piece
of
bar
silver
,
an
*NL*
old
Spanish
watch
and
some
other
trinkets
of
little
value
and
mostly
of
*NL*
foreign
make
,
a
pair
of
compasses
mounted
with
brass
,
and
five
or
six
*NL*
curious
West
Indian
shells
.
I
have
often
wondered
since
why
he
should
*NL*
have
carried
about
these
shells
with
him
in
his
wandering
,
guilty
,
and
*NL*
hunted
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
we
had
found
nothing
of
any
value
but
the
silver
and
*NL*
the
trinkets
,
and
neither
of
these
were
in
our
way
.
Underneath
there
*NL*
was
an
old
boat-cloak
,
whitened
with
sea-salt
on
many
a
harbour-bar
.
My
*NL*
mother
pulled
it
up
with
impatience
,
and
there
lay
before
us
,
the
last
*NL*
things
in
the
chest
,
a
bundle
tied
up
in
oilcloth
,
and
looking
like
*NL*
papers
,
and
a
canvas
bag
that
gave
forth
,
at
a
touch
,
the
jingle
of
*NL*
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
show
these
rogues
that
I
'm
an
honest
woman
,
''
said
my
mother
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
have
my
dues
,
and
not
a
farthing
over
.
Hold
Mrs.
Crossley
's
bag
.
''
And
*NL*
she
began
to
count
over
the
amount
of
the
captain
's
score
from
the
*NL*
sailor
's
bag
into
the
one
that
I
was
holding
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
long
,
difficult
business
,
for
the
coins
were
of
all
countries
*NL*
and
sizes
--
doubloons
,
and
louis
d'ors
,
and
guineas
,
and
pieces
of
eight
,
*NL*
and
I
know
not
what
besides
,
all
shaken
together
at
random
.
The
guineas
,
*NL*
too
,
were
about
the
scarcest
,
and
it
was
with
these
only
that
my
mother
*NL*
knew
how
to
make
her
count
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
were
about
half-way
through
,
I
suddenly
put
my
hand
upon
her
*NL*
arm
,
for
I
had
heard
in
the
silent
frosty
air
a
sound
that
brought
my
*NL*
heart
into
my
mouth
--
the
tap-tapping
of
the
blind
man
's
stick
upon
the
*NL*
frozen
road
.
It
drew
nearer
and
nearer
,
while
we
sat
holding
our
breath
.
*NL*
Then
it
struck
sharp
on
the
inn
door
,
and
then
we
could
hear
the
handle
*NL*
being
turned
and
the
bolt
rattling
as
the
wretched
being
tried
to
enter
;
*NL*
and
then
there
was
a
long
time
of
silence
both
within
and
without
.
*NL*
At
last
the
tapping
recommenced
,
and
,
to
our
indescribable
joy
and
*NL*
gratitude
,
died
slowly
away
again
until
it
ceased
to
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
said
I
,
``
take
the
whole
and
let
's
be
going
,
''
for
I
was
sure
*NL*
the
bolted
door
must
have
seemed
suspicious
and
would
bring
the
whole
*NL*
hornet
's
nest
about
our
ears
,
though
how
thankful
I
was
that
I
had
*NL*
bolted
it
,
none
could
tell
who
had
never
met
that
terrible
blind
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
mother
,
frightened
as
she
was
,
would
not
consent
to
take
a
*NL*
fraction
more
than
was
due
to
her
and
was
obstinately
unwilling
to
be
*NL*
content
with
less
.
It
was
not
yet
seven
,
she
said
,
by
a
long
way
;
she
*NL*
knew
her
rights
and
she
would
have
them
;
and
she
was
still
arguing
with
*NL*
me
when
a
little
low
whistle
sounded
a
good
way
off
upon
the
hill
.
That
*NL*
was
enough
,
and
more
than
enough
,
for
both
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
take
what
I
have
,
''
she
said
,
jumping
to
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
'll
take
this
to
square
the
count
,
''
said
I
,
picking
up
the
oilskin
*NL*
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
moment
we
were
both
groping
downstairs
,
leaving
the
candle
by
*NL*
the
empty
chest
;
and
the
next
we
had
opened
the
door
and
were
in
full
*NL*
retreat
.
We
had
not
started
a
moment
too
soon
.
The
fog
was
rapidly
*NL*
dispersing
;
already
the
moon
shone
quite
clear
on
the
high
ground
on
*NL*
either
side
;
and
it
was
only
in
the
exact
bottom
of
the
dell
and
round
*NL*
the
tavern
door
that
a
thin
veil
still
hung
unbroken
to
conceal
the
*NL*
first
steps
of
our
escape
.
Far
less
than
half-way
to
the
hamlet
,
very
*NL*
little
beyond
the
bottom
of
the
hill
,
we
must
come
forth
into
the
*NL*
moonlight
.
Nor
was
this
all
,
for
the
sound
of
several
footsteps
running
*NL*
came
already
to
our
ears
,
and
as
we
looked
back
in
their
direction
,
a
*NL*
light
tossing
to
and
fro
and
still
rapidly
advancing
showed
that
one
of
*NL*
the
newcomers
carried
a
lantern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
said
my
mother
suddenly
,
``
take
the
money
and
run
on
.
I
am
*NL*
going
to
faint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
certainly
the
end
for
both
of
us
,
I
thought
.
How
I
cursed
the
*NL*
cowardice
of
the
neighbours
;
how
I
blamed
my
poor
mother
for
her
honesty
*NL*
and
her
greed
,
for
her
past
foolhardiness
and
present
weakness
!
We
were
*NL*
just
at
the
little
bridge
,
by
good
fortune
;
and
I
helped
her
,
tottering
*NL*
as
she
was
,
to
the
edge
of
the
bank
,
where
,
sure
enough
,
she
gave
a
sigh
*NL*
and
fell
on
my
shoulder
.
I
do
not
know
how
I
found
the
strength
to
do
it
*NL*
at
all
,
and
I
am
afraid
it
was
roughly
done
,
but
I
managed
to
drag
her
*NL*
down
the
bank
and
a
little
way
under
the
arch
.
Farther
I
could
not
move
*NL*
her
,
for
the
bridge
was
too
low
to
let
me
do
more
than
crawl
below
it
.
*NL*
So
there
we
had
to
stay
--
my
mother
almost
entirely
exposed
and
both
of
*NL*
us
within
earshot
of
the
inn
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
Last
of
the
Blind
Man
*NL*
*NL*
MY
curiosity
,
in
a
sense
,
was
stronger
than
my
fear
,
for
I
could
not
*NL*
remain
where
I
was
,
but
crept
back
to
the
bank
again
,
whence
,
sheltering
*NL*
my
head
behind
a
bush
of
broom
,
I
might
command
the
road
before
our
*NL*
door
.
I
was
scarcely
in
position
ere
my
enemies
began
to
arrive
,
seven
*NL*
or
eight
of
them
,
running
hard
,
their
feet
beating
out
of
time
along
*NL*
the
road
and
the
man
with
the
lantern
some
paces
in
front
.
Three
men
ran
*NL*
together
,
hand
in
hand
;
and
I
made
out
,
even
through
the
mist
,
that
the
*NL*
middle
man
of
this
trio
was
the
blind
beggar
.
The
next
moment
his
voice
*NL*
showed
me
that
I
was
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
with
the
door
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
sir
!
''
answered
two
or
three
;
and
a
rush
was
made
upon
the
*NL*
Admiral
Benbow
,
the
lantern-bearer
following
;
and
then
I
could
see
*NL*
them
pause
,
and
hear
speeches
passed
in
a
lower
key
,
as
if
they
were
*NL*
surprised
to
find
the
door
open
.
But
the
pause
was
brief
,
for
the
blind
*NL*
man
again
issued
his
commands
.
His
voice
sounded
louder
and
higher
,
as
*NL*
if
he
were
afire
with
eagerness
and
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
,
in
,
in
!
''
he
shouted
,
and
cursed
them
for
their
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
or
five
of
them
obeyed
at
once
,
two
remaining
on
the
road
with
the
*NL*
formidable
beggar
.
There
was
a
pause
,
then
a
cry
of
surprise
,
and
then
a
*NL*
voice
shouting
from
the
house
,
``
Bill
's
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
blind
man
swore
at
them
again
for
their
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Search
him
,
some
of
you
shirking
lubbers
,
and
the
rest
of
you
aloft
and
*NL*
get
the
chest
,
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hear
their
feet
rattling
up
our
old
stairs
,
so
that
the
*NL*
house
must
have
shook
with
it
.
Promptly
afterwards
,
fresh
sounds
of
*NL*
astonishment
arose
;
the
window
of
the
captain
's
room
was
thrown
open
*NL*
with
a
slam
and
a
jingle
of
broken
glass
,
and
a
man
leaned
out
into
the
*NL*
moonlight
,
head
and
shoulders
,
and
addressed
the
blind
beggar
on
the
*NL*
road
below
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pew
,
''
he
cried
,
``
they
've
been
before
us
.
Someone
's
turned
the
chest
out
*NL*
alow
and
aloft
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
there
?
''
roared
Pew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
money
's
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
blind
man
cursed
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Flint
's
fist
,
I
mean
,
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
see
it
here
nohow
,
''
returned
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
you
below
there
,
is
it
on
Bill
?
''
cried
the
blind
man
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
another
fellow
,
probably
him
who
had
remained
below
to
search
*NL*
the
captain
's
body
,
came
to
the
door
of
the
inn
.
``
Bill
's
been
overhauled
*NL*
a
`
ready
,
''
said
he
;
``
nothin
'
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
these
people
of
the
inn
--
it
's
that
boy
.
I
wish
I
had
put
his
eyes
*NL*
out
!
''
cried
the
blind
man
,
Pew
.
``
There
were
no
time
ago
--
they
had
the
*NL*
door
bolted
when
I
tried
it
.
Scatter
,
lads
,
and
find
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
enough
,
they
left
their
glim
here
,
''
said
the
fellow
from
the
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scatter
and
find
'em
!
Rout
the
house
out
!
''
reiterated
Pew
,
striking
*NL*
with
his
stick
upon
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
followed
a
great
to-do
through
all
our
old
inn
,
heavy
feet
*NL*
pounding
to
and
fro
,
furniture
thrown
over
,
doors
kicked
in
,
until
the
*NL*
very
rocks
re-echoed
and
the
men
came
out
again
,
one
after
another
,
on
*NL*
the
road
and
declared
that
we
were
nowhere
to
be
found
.
And
just
*NL*
the
same
whistle
that
had
alarmed
my
mother
and
myself
over
the
dead
*NL*
captain
's
money
was
once
more
clearly
audible
through
the
night
,
*NL*
but
this
time
twice
repeated
.
I
had
thought
it
to
be
the
blind
man
's
*NL*
trumpet
,
so
to
speak
,
summoning
his
crew
to
the
assault
,
but
I
now
found
*NL*
that
it
was
a
signal
from
the
hillside
towards
the
hamlet
,
and
from
its
*NL*
effect
upon
the
buccaneers
,
a
signal
to
warn
them
of
approaching
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
Dirk
again
,
''
said
one
.
``
Twice
!
We
'll
have
to
budge
,
mates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Budge
,
you
skulk
!
''
cried
Pew
.
``
Dirk
was
a
fool
and
a
coward
from
the
*NL*
first
--
you
would
n't
mind
him
.
They
must
be
close
by
;
they
ca
n't
be
far
;
*NL*
you
have
your
hands
on
it
.
Scatter
and
look
for
them
,
dogs
!
Oh
,
shiver
*NL*
my
soul
,
''
he
cried
,
``
if
I
had
eyes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
appeal
seemed
to
produce
some
effect
,
for
two
of
the
fellows
began
*NL*
to
look
here
and
there
among
the
lumber
,
but
half-heartedly
,
I
thought
,
*NL*
and
with
half
an
eye
to
their
own
danger
all
the
time
,
while
the
rest
*NL*
stood
irresolute
on
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
your
hands
on
thousands
,
you
fools
,
and
you
hang
a
leg
!
You
'd
*NL*
be
as
rich
as
kings
if
you
could
find
it
,
and
you
know
it
's
here
,
and
*NL*
you
stand
there
skulking
.
There
was
n't
one
of
you
dared
face
Bill
,
and
*NL*
I
did
it
--
a
blind
man
!
And
I
'm
to
lose
my
chance
for
you
!
I
'm
to
be
a
*NL*
poor
,
crawling
beggar
,
sponging
for
rum
,
when
I
might
be
rolling
in
a
*NL*
coach
!
If
you
had
the
pluck
of
a
weevil
in
a
biscuit
you
would
catch
*NL*
them
still
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
it
,
Pew
,
we
've
got
the
doubloons
!
''
grumbled
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
might
have
hid
the
blessed
thing
,
''
said
another
.
``
Take
the
*NL*
Georges
,
Pew
,
and
do
n't
stand
here
squalling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Squalling
was
the
word
for
it
;
Pew
's
anger
rose
so
high
at
these
*NL*
objections
till
at
last
,
his
passion
completely
taking
the
upper
hand
,
*NL*
he
struck
at
them
right
and
left
in
his
blindness
and
his
stick
sounded
*NL*
heavily
on
more
than
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
,
in
their
turn
,
cursed
back
at
the
blind
miscreant
,
threatened
him
*NL*
in
horrid
terms
,
and
tried
in
vain
to
catch
the
stick
and
wrest
it
from
*NL*
his
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
quarrel
was
the
saving
of
us
,
for
while
it
was
still
raging
,
*NL*
another
sound
came
from
the
top
of
the
hill
on
the
side
of
the
*NL*
hamlet
--
the
tramp
of
horses
galloping
.
Almost
at
the
same
time
a
*NL*
pistol-shot
,
flash
and
report
,
came
from
the
hedge
side
.
And
that
was
*NL*
plainly
the
last
signal
of
danger
,
for
the
buccaneers
turned
at
once
*NL*
and
ran
,
separating
in
every
direction
,
one
seaward
along
the
cove
,
one
*NL*
slant
across
the
hill
,
and
so
on
,
so
that
in
half
a
minute
not
a
sign
of
*NL*
them
remained
but
Pew
.
Him
they
had
deserted
,
whether
in
sheer
panic
*NL*
or
out
of
revenge
for
his
ill
words
and
blows
I
know
not
;
but
there
he
*NL*
remained
behind
,
tapping
up
and
down
the
road
in
a
frenzy
,
and
groping
*NL*
and
calling
for
his
comrades
.
Finally
he
took
a
wrong
turn
and
ran
a
few
*NL*
steps
past
me
,
towards
the
hamlet
,
crying
,
``
Johnny
,
Black
Dog
,
Dirk
,
''
*NL*
and
other
names
,
``
you
wo
n't
leave
old
Pew
,
mates
--
not
old
Pew
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
the
noise
of
horses
topped
the
rise
,
and
four
or
five
riders
*NL*
came
in
sight
in
the
moonlight
and
swept
at
full
gallop
down
the
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
Pew
saw
his
error
,
turned
with
a
scream
,
and
ran
straight
for
*NL*
the
ditch
,
into
which
he
rolled
.
But
he
was
on
his
feet
again
in
a
*NL*
second
and
made
another
dash
,
now
utterly
bewildered
,
right
under
the
*NL*
nearest
of
the
coming
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rider
tried
to
save
him
,
but
in
vain
.
Down
went
Pew
with
a
cry
that
*NL*
rang
high
into
the
night
;
and
the
four
hoofs
trampled
and
spurned
him
*NL*
and
passed
by
.
He
fell
on
his
side
,
then
gently
collapsed
upon
his
face
*NL*
and
moved
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
leaped
to
my
feet
and
hailed
the
riders
.
They
were
pulling
up
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
,
horrified
at
the
accident
;
and
I
soon
saw
what
they
were
.
One
,
*NL*
tailing
out
behind
the
rest
,
was
a
lad
that
had
gone
from
the
hamlet
to
*NL*
Dr.
Livesey
's
;
the
rest
were
revenue
officers
,
whom
he
had
met
by
the
*NL*
way
,
and
with
whom
he
had
had
the
intelligence
to
return
at
once
.
Some
*NL*
news
of
the
lugger
in
Kitt
's
Hole
had
found
its
way
to
Supervisor
Dance
*NL*
and
set
him
forth
that
night
in
our
direction
,
and
to
that
circumstance
*NL*
my
mother
and
I
owed
our
preservation
from
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pew
was
dead
,
stone
dead
.
As
for
my
mother
,
when
we
had
carried
her
up
*NL*
to
the
hamlet
,
a
little
cold
water
and
salts
and
that
soon
brought
her
*NL*
back
again
,
and
she
was
none
the
worse
for
her
terror
,
though
she
still
*NL*
continued
to
deplore
the
balance
of
the
money
.
In
the
meantime
the
*NL*
supervisor
rode
on
,
as
fast
as
he
could
,
to
Kitt
's
Hole
;
but
his
men
*NL*
had
to
dismount
and
grope
down
the
dingle
,
leading
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
supporting
,
their
horses
,
and
in
continual
fear
of
ambushes
;
so
it
was
*NL*
no
great
matter
for
surprise
that
when
they
got
down
to
the
Hole
the
*NL*
lugger
was
already
under
way
,
though
still
close
in
.
He
hailed
her
.
A
*NL*
voice
replied
,
telling
him
to
keep
out
of
the
moonlight
or
he
would
get
*NL*
some
lead
in
him
,
and
at
the
same
time
a
bullet
whistled
close
by
his
*NL*
arm
.
Soon
after
,
the
lugger
doubled
the
point
and
disappeared
.
Mr.
Dance
*NL*
stood
there
,
as
he
said
,
``
like
a
fish
out
of
water
,
''
and
all
he
could
do
*NL*
was
to
dispatch
a
man
to
B
--
to
warn
the
cutter
.
``
And
that
,
''
said
he
,
*NL*
``
is
just
about
as
good
as
nothing
.
They
've
got
off
clean
,
and
there
's
*NL*
an
end
.
Only
,
''
he
added
,
``
I
'm
glad
I
trod
on
Master
Pew
's
corns
,
''
for
by
*NL*
this
time
he
had
heard
my
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
back
with
him
to
the
Admiral
Benbow
,
and
you
can
not
imagine
a
*NL*
house
in
such
a
state
of
smash
;
the
very
clock
had
been
thrown
down
*NL*
by
these
fellows
in
their
furious
hunt
after
my
mother
and
myself
;
*NL*
and
though
nothing
had
actually
been
taken
away
except
the
captain
's
*NL*
money-bag
and
a
little
silver
from
the
till
,
I
could
see
at
once
that
we
*NL*
were
ruined
.
Mr.
Dance
could
make
nothing
of
the
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
got
the
money
,
you
say
?
Well
,
then
,
Hawkins
,
what
in
fortune
were
*NL*
they
after
?
More
money
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
;
not
money
,
I
think
,
''
replied
I.
``
In
fact
,
sir
,
I
believe
I
*NL*
have
the
thing
in
my
breast
pocket
;
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
I
should
*NL*
like
to
get
it
put
in
safety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
boy
;
quite
right
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
'll
take
it
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
perhaps
Dr.
Livesey
--
''
I
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perfectly
right
,
''
he
interrupted
very
cheerily
,
``
perfectly
right
--
a
*NL*
gentleman
and
a
magistrate
.
And
,
now
I
come
to
think
of
it
,
I
might
as
*NL*
well
ride
round
there
myself
and
report
to
him
or
squire
.
Master
Pew
's
*NL*
dead
,
when
all
's
done
;
not
that
I
regret
it
,
but
he
's
dead
,
you
see
,
and
*NL*
people
will
make
it
out
against
an
officer
of
his
Majesty
's
revenue
,
*NL*
if
make
it
out
they
can
.
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
Hawkins
,
if
you
like
,
I
'll
*NL*
take
you
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thanked
him
heartily
for
the
offer
,
and
we
walked
back
to
the
hamlet
*NL*
where
the
horses
were
.
By
the
time
I
had
told
mother
of
my
purpose
they
*NL*
were
all
in
the
saddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dogger
,
''
said
Mr.
Dance
,
``
you
have
a
good
horse
;
take
up
this
lad
*NL*
behind
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
was
mounted
,
holding
on
to
Dogger
's
belt
,
the
supervisor
*NL*
gave
the
word
,
and
the
party
struck
out
at
a
bouncing
trot
on
the
road
*NL*
to
Dr.
Livesey
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
6
*NL*
*NL*
The
Captain
's
Papers
*NL*
*NL*
WE
rode
hard
all
the
way
till
we
drew
up
before
Dr.
Livesey
's
door
.
The
*NL*
house
was
all
dark
to
the
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dance
told
me
to
jump
down
and
knock
,
and
Dogger
gave
me
a
stirrup
*NL*
to
descend
by
.
The
door
was
opened
almost
at
once
by
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Dr.
Livesey
in
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
she
said
,
he
had
come
home
in
the
afternoon
but
had
gone
up
to
the
*NL*
hall
to
dine
and
pass
the
evening
with
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
there
we
go
,
boys
,
''
said
Mr.
Dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
,
as
the
distance
was
short
,
I
did
not
mount
,
but
ran
with
*NL*
Dogger
's
stirrup-leather
to
the
lodge
gates
and
up
the
long
,
leafless
,
*NL*
moonlit
avenue
to
where
the
white
line
of
the
hall
buildings
looked
on
*NL*
either
hand
on
great
old
gardens
.
Here
Mr.
Dance
dismounted
,
and
taking
*NL*
me
along
with
him
,
was
admitted
at
a
word
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
led
us
down
a
matted
passage
and
showed
us
at
the
end
into
a
*NL*
great
library
,
all
lined
with
bookcases
and
busts
upon
the
top
of
them
,
*NL*
where
the
squire
and
Dr.
Livesey
sat
,
pipe
in
hand
,
on
either
side
of
a
*NL*
bright
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
never
seen
the
squire
so
near
at
hand
.
He
was
a
tall
man
,
over
six
*NL*
feet
high
,
and
broad
in
proportion
,
and
he
had
a
bluff
,
rough-and-ready
*NL*
face
,
all
roughened
and
reddened
and
lined
in
his
long
travels
.
His
*NL*
eyebrows
were
very
black
,
and
moved
readily
,
and
this
gave
him
a
look
of
*NL*
some
temper
,
not
bad
,
you
would
say
,
but
quick
and
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
Mr.
Dance
,
''
says
he
,
very
stately
and
condescending
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Dance
,
''
says
the
doctor
with
a
nod
.
``
And
good
evening
to
*NL*
you
,
friend
Jim
.
What
good
wind
brings
you
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
supervisor
stood
up
straight
and
stiff
and
told
his
story
like
a
*NL*
lesson
;
and
you
should
have
seen
how
the
two
gentlemen
leaned
forward
*NL*
and
looked
at
each
other
,
and
forgot
to
smoke
in
their
surprise
and
*NL*
interest
.
When
they
heard
how
my
mother
went
back
to
the
inn
,
Dr.
*NL*
Livesey
fairly
slapped
his
thigh
,
and
the
squire
cried
``
Bravo
!
''
and
*NL*
broke
his
long
pipe
against
the
grate
.
Long
before
it
was
done
,
Mr.
*NL*
Trelawney
-LRB-
that
,
you
will
remember
,
was
the
squire
's
name
-RRB-
had
got
up
*NL*
from
his
seat
and
was
striding
about
the
room
,
and
the
doctor
,
as
if
to
*NL*
hear
the
better
,
had
taken
off
his
powdered
wig
and
sat
there
looking
*NL*
very
strange
indeed
with
his
own
close-cropped
black
poll
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Mr.
Dance
finished
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Dance
,
''
said
the
squire
,
``
you
are
a
very
noble
fellow
.
And
as
for
*NL*
riding
down
that
black
,
atrocious
miscreant
,
I
regard
it
as
an
act
of
*NL*
virtue
,
sir
,
like
stamping
on
a
cockroach
.
This
lad
Hawkins
is
a
trump
,
*NL*
I
perceive
.
Hawkins
,
will
you
ring
that
bell
?
Mr.
Dance
must
have
some
*NL*
ale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
,
Jim
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
you
have
the
thing
that
they
were
*NL*
after
,
have
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
,
sir
,
''
said
I
,
and
gave
him
the
oilskin
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
looked
it
all
over
,
as
if
his
fingers
were
itching
to
open
*NL*
it
;
but
instead
of
doing
that
,
he
put
it
quietly
in
the
pocket
of
his
*NL*
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Squire
,
''
said
he
,
``
when
Dance
has
had
his
ale
he
must
,
of
course
,
be
*NL*
off
on
his
Majesty
's
service
;
but
I
mean
to
keep
Jim
Hawkins
here
to
*NL*
sleep
at
my
house
,
and
with
your
permission
,
I
propose
we
should
have
up
*NL*
the
cold
pie
and
let
him
sup
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
will
,
Livesey
,
''
said
the
squire
;
``
Hawkins
has
earned
better
than
*NL*
cold
pie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
a
big
pigeon
pie
was
brought
in
and
put
on
a
sidetable
,
and
I
made
*NL*
a
hearty
supper
,
for
I
was
as
hungry
as
a
hawk
,
while
Mr.
Dance
was
*NL*
further
complimented
and
at
last
dismissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
squire
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
Livesey
,
''
said
the
squire
in
the
same
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
at
a
time
,
one
at
a
time
,
''
laughed
Dr.
Livesey
.
``
You
have
heard
of
*NL*
this
Flint
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heard
of
him
!
''
cried
the
squire
.
``
Heard
of
him
,
you
say
!
He
was
the
*NL*
bloodthirstiest
buccaneer
that
sailed
.
Blackbeard
was
a
child
to
Flint
.
*NL*
The
Spaniards
were
so
prodigiously
afraid
of
him
that
,
I
tell
you
,
sir
,
*NL*
I
was
sometimes
proud
he
was
an
Englishman
.
I
've
seen
his
top-sails
with
*NL*
these
eyes
,
off
Trinidad
,
and
the
cowardly
son
of
a
rum-puncheon
that
I
*NL*
sailed
with
put
back
--
put
back
,
sir
,
into
Port
of
Spain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
heard
of
him
myself
,
in
England
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
But
the
*NL*
point
is
,
had
he
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Money
!
''
cried
the
squire
.
``
Have
you
heard
the
story
?
What
were
these
*NL*
villains
after
but
money
?
What
do
they
care
for
but
money
?
For
what
*NL*
would
they
risk
their
rascal
carcasses
but
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
we
shall
soon
know
,
''
replied
the
doctor
.
``
But
you
are
so
*NL*
confoundedly
hot-headed
and
exclamatory
that
I
can
not
get
a
word
in
.
*NL*
What
I
want
to
know
is
this
:
Supposing
that
I
have
here
in
my
pocket
*NL*
some
clue
to
where
Flint
buried
his
treasure
,
will
that
treasure
amount
*NL*
to
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amount
,
sir
!
''
cried
the
squire
.
``
It
will
amount
to
this
:
If
we
have
the
*NL*
clue
you
talk
about
,
I
fit
out
a
ship
in
Bristol
dock
,
and
take
you
and
*NL*
Hawkins
here
along
,
and
I
'll
have
that
treasure
if
I
search
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
Now
,
then
,
if
Jim
is
agreeable
,
we
'll
*NL*
open
the
packet
''
;
and
he
laid
it
before
him
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bundle
was
sewn
together
,
and
the
doctor
had
to
get
out
his
*NL*
instrument
case
and
cut
the
stitches
with
his
medical
scissors
.
It
*NL*
contained
two
things
--
a
book
and
a
sealed
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
of
all
we
'll
try
the
book
,
''
observed
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
and
I
were
both
peering
over
his
shoulder
as
he
opened
*NL*
it
,
for
Dr.
Livesey
had
kindly
motioned
me
to
come
round
from
the
*NL*
side-table
,
where
I
had
been
eating
,
to
enjoy
the
sport
of
the
search
.
*NL*
On
the
first
page
there
were
only
some
scraps
of
writing
,
such
as
a
man
*NL*
with
a
pen
in
his
hand
might
make
for
idleness
or
practice
.
One
was
the
*NL*
same
as
the
tattoo
mark
,
``
Billy
Bones
his
fancy
''
;
then
there
was
``
Mr.
W.
*NL*
Bones
,
mate
,
''
``
No
more
rum
,
''
``
Off
Palm
Key
he
got
itt
,
''
and
some
other
*NL*
snatches
,
mostly
single
words
and
unintelligible
.
I
could
not
help
*NL*
wondering
who
it
was
that
had
``
got
itt
,
''
and
what
``
itt
''
was
that
he
got
.
*NL*
A
knife
in
his
back
as
like
as
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
instruction
there
,
''
said
Dr.
Livesey
as
he
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
ten
or
twelve
pages
were
filled
with
a
curious
series
of
*NL*
entries
.
There
was
a
date
at
one
end
of
the
line
and
at
the
other
a
*NL*
sum
of
money
,
as
in
common
account-books
,
but
instead
of
explanatory
*NL*
writing
,
only
a
varying
number
of
crosses
between
the
two
.
On
the
12th
*NL*
of
June
,
1745
,
for
instance
,
a
sum
of
seventy
pounds
had
plainly
become
*NL*
due
to
someone
,
and
there
was
nothing
but
six
crosses
to
explain
the
*NL*
cause
.
In
a
few
cases
,
to
be
sure
,
the
name
of
a
place
would
be
added
,
*NL*
as
``
Offe
Caraccas
,
''
or
a
mere
entry
of
latitude
and
longitude
,
as
``
62o
*NL*
17
'
20
''
,
19o
2
'
40
''
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
record
lasted
over
nearly
twenty
years
,
the
amount
of
the
separate
*NL*
entries
growing
larger
as
time
went
on
,
and
at
the
end
a
grand
total
*NL*
had
been
made
out
after
five
or
six
wrong
additions
,
and
these
words
*NL*
appended
,
``
Bones
,
his
pile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
make
head
or
tail
of
this
,
''
said
Dr.
Livesey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
thing
is
as
clear
as
noonday
,
''
cried
the
squire
.
``
This
is
the
*NL*
black-hearted
hound
's
account-book
.
These
crosses
stand
for
the
names
of
*NL*
ships
or
towns
that
they
sank
or
plundered
.
The
sums
are
the
scoundrel
's
*NL*
share
,
and
where
he
feared
an
ambiguity
,
you
see
he
added
something
*NL*
clearer
.
`
Offe
Caraccas
,
'
now
;
you
see
,
here
was
some
unhappy
vessel
*NL*
boarded
off
that
coast
.
God
help
the
poor
souls
that
manned
her
--
coral
*NL*
long
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
!
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
See
what
it
is
to
be
a
traveller
.
Right
!
And
*NL*
the
amounts
increase
,
you
see
,
as
he
rose
in
rank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
little
else
in
the
volume
but
a
few
bearings
of
places
noted
*NL*
in
the
blank
leaves
towards
the
end
and
a
table
for
reducing
French
,
*NL*
English
,
and
Spanish
moneys
to
a
common
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thrifty
man
!
''
cried
the
doctor
.
``
He
was
n't
the
one
to
be
cheated
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
the
squire
,
``
for
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
paper
had
been
sealed
in
several
places
with
a
thimble
by
way
of
*NL*
seal
;
the
very
thimble
,
perhaps
,
that
I
had
found
in
the
captain
's
*NL*
pocket
.
The
doctor
opened
the
seals
with
great
care
,
and
there
fell
out
*NL*
the
map
of
an
island
,
with
latitude
and
longitude
,
soundings
,
names
of
*NL*
hills
and
bays
and
inlets
,
and
every
particular
that
would
be
needed
*NL*
to
bring
a
ship
to
a
safe
anchorage
upon
its
shores
.
It
was
about
nine
*NL*
miles
long
and
five
across
,
shaped
,
you
might
say
,
like
a
fat
dragon
*NL*
standing
up
,
and
had
two
fine
land-locked
harbours
,
and
a
hill
in
the
*NL*
centre
part
marked
``
The
Spy-glass
.
''
There
were
several
additions
of
a
*NL*
later
date
,
but
above
all
,
three
crosses
of
red
ink
--
two
on
the
north
*NL*
part
of
the
island
,
one
in
the
southwest
--
and
beside
this
last
,
in
*NL*
the
same
red
ink
,
and
in
a
small
,
neat
hand
,
very
different
from
the
*NL*
captain
's
tottery
characters
,
these
words
:
``
Bulk
of
treasure
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Over
on
the
back
the
same
hand
had
written
this
further
information
:
*NL*
*NL*
Tall
tree
,
Spy-glass
shoulder
,
bearing
a
point
to
*NL*
the
N.
of
N.N.E.
*NL*
*NL*
Skeleton
Island
E.S.E.
and
by
E.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bar
silver
is
in
the
north
cache
;
you
can
find
*NL*
it
by
the
trend
of
the
east
hummock
,
ten
fathoms
*NL*
south
of
the
black
crag
with
the
face
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arms
are
easy
found
,
in
the
sand-hill
,
N.
*NL*
point
of
north
inlet
cape
,
bearing
E.
and
a
*NL*
quarter
N.
*NL*
J.F.
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
;
but
brief
as
it
was
,
and
to
me
incomprehensible
,
it
filled
*NL*
the
squire
and
Dr.
Livesey
with
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Livesey

said
the
squire
,
``
you

the

returned
the
squire
,
``

PART
TWO
--
The
Sea-cook
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
7
*NL*
*NL*
I
Go
to
Bristol
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
longer
than
the
squire
imagined
ere
we
were
ready
for
the
sea
,
*NL*
and
none
of
our
first
plans
--
not
even
Dr.
Livesey
's
,
of
keeping
me
*NL*
beside
him
--
could
be
carried
out
as
we
intended
.
The
doctor
had
to
go
*NL*
to
London
for
a
physician
to
take
charge
of
his
practice
;
the
squire
was
*NL*
hard
at
work
at
Bristol
;
and
I
lived
on
at
the
hall
under
the
charge
of
*NL*
old
Redruth
,
the
gamekeeper
,
almost
a
prisoner
,
but
full
of
sea-dreams
*NL*
and
the
most
charming
anticipations
of
strange
islands
and
adventures
.
*NL*
I
brooded
by
the
hour
together
over
the
map
,
all
the
details
of
which
*NL*
I
well
remembered
.
Sitting
by
the
fire
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
,
I
*NL*
approached
that
island
in
my
fancy
from
every
possible
direction
;
I
*NL*
explored
every
acre
of
its
surface
;
I
climbed
a
thousand
times
to
that
*NL*
tall
hill
they
call
the
Spy-glass
,
and
from
the
top
enjoyed
the
most
*NL*
wonderful
and
changing
prospects
.
Sometimes
the
isle
was
thick
with
*NL*
savages
,
with
whom
we
fought
,
sometimes
full
of
dangerous
animals
that
*NL*
hunted
us
,
but
in
all
my
fancies
nothing
occurred
to
me
so
strange
and
*NL*
tragic
as
our
actual
adventures
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
weeks
passed
on
,
till
one
fine
day
there
came
a
letter
addressed
*NL*
to
Dr.
Livesey
,
with
this
addition
,
``
To
be
opened
,
in
the
case
of
his
*NL*
absence
,
by
Tom
Redruth
or
young
Hawkins
.
''
Obeying
this
order
,
we
*NL*
found
,
or
rather
I
found
--
for
the
gamekeeper
was
a
poor
hand
at
reading
*NL*
anything
but
print
--
the
following
important
news
:
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Anchor
Inn
,
Bristol
,
March
1
,
17
--
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Livesey
--
As
I
do
not
know
whether
you
*NL*
are
at
the
hall
or
still
in
London
,
I
send
this
in
*NL*
double
to
both
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ship
is
bought
and
fitted
.
She
lies
at
*NL*
anchor
,
ready
for
sea
.
You
never
imagined
a
*NL*
sweeter
schooner
--
a
child
might
sail
her
--
two
*NL*
hundred
tons
;
name
,
HISPANIOLA
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
got
her
through
my
old
friend
,
Blandly
,
who
*NL*
has
proved
himself
throughout
the
most
surprising
*NL*
trump
.
The
admirable
fellow
literally
slaved
in
*NL*
my
interest
,
and
so
,
I
may
say
,
did
everyone
in
*NL*
Bristol
,
as
soon
as
they
got
wind
of
the
port
we
*NL*
sailed
for
--
treasure
,
I
mean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Redruth
,
''
said
I
,
interrupting
the
letter
,
``
Dr.
Livesey
will
not
like
*NL*
that
.
The
squire
has
been
talking
,
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
who
's
a
better
right
?
''
growled
the
gamekeeper
.
``
A
pretty
rum
go
*NL*
if
squire
ai
n't
to
talk
for
Dr.
Livesey
,
I
should
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
I
gave
up
all
attempts
at
commentary
and
read
straight
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
Blandly
himself
found
the
HISPANIOLA
,
and
*NL*
by
the
most
admirable
management
got
her
for
the
*NL*
merest
trifle
.
There
is
a
class
of
men
in
Bristol
*NL*
monstrously
prejudiced
against
Blandly
.
They
go
*NL*
the
length
of
declaring
that
this
honest
creature
*NL*
would
do
anything
for
money
,
that
the
HISPANIOLA
*NL*
belonged
to
him
,
and
that
he
sold
it
me
absurdly
*NL*
high
--
the
most
transparent
calumnies
.
None
of
them
*NL*
dare
,
however
,
to
deny
the
merits
of
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
there
was
not
a
hitch
.
The
*NL*
workpeople
,
to
be
sure
--
riggers
and
what
not
--
were
*NL*
most
annoyingly
slow
;
but
time
cured
that
.
It
was
*NL*
the
crew
that
troubled
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wished
a
round
score
of
men
--
in
case
of
*NL*
natives
,
buccaneers
,
or
the
odious
French
--
and
I
*NL*
had
the
worry
of
the
deuce
itself
to
find
so
much
*NL*
as
half
a
dozen
,
till
the
most
remarkable
stroke
*NL*
of
fortune
brought
me
the
very
man
that
I
*NL*
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
standing
on
the
dock
,
when
,
by
the
*NL*
merest
accident
,
I
fell
in
talk
with
him
.
I
found
*NL*
he
was
an
old
sailor
,
kept
a
public-house
,
knew
*NL*
all
the
seafaring
men
in
Bristol
,
had
lost
his
*NL*
health
ashore
,
and
wanted
a
good
berth
as
cook
to
*NL*
get
to
sea
again
.
He
had
hobbled
down
there
that
*NL*
morning
,
he
said
,
to
get
a
smell
of
the
salt
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
monstrously
touched
--
so
would
you
have
*NL*
been
--
and
,
out
of
pure
pity
,
I
engaged
him
on
the
*NL*
spot
to
be
ship
's
cook
.
Long
John
Silver
,
he
is
*NL*
called
,
and
has
lost
a
leg
;
but
that
I
regarded
as
*NL*
a
recommendation
,
since
he
lost
it
in
his
*NL*
country
's
service
,
under
the
immortal
Hawke
.
He
*NL*
has
no
pension
,
Livesey
.
Imagine
the
abominable
*NL*
age
we
live
in
!
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
sir
,
I
thought
I
had
only
found
a
cook
,
*NL*
but
it
was
a
crew
I
had
discovered
.
Between
*NL*
Silver
and
myself
we
got
together
in
a
few
days
a
*NL*
company
of
the
toughest
old
salts
imaginable
--
not
*NL*
pretty
to
look
at
,
but
fellows
,
by
their
faces
,
of
*NL*
the
most
indomitable
spirit
.
I
declare
we
could
*NL*
fight
a
frigate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
John
even
got
rid
of
two
out
of
the
six
*NL*
or
seven
I
had
already
engaged
.
He
showed
me
in
a
*NL*
moment
that
they
were
just
the
sort
of
fresh-water
*NL*
swabs
we
had
to
fear
in
an
adventure
of
*NL*
importance
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
in
the
most
magnificent
health
and
*NL*
spirits
,
eating
like
a
bull
,
sleeping
like
a
tree
,
*NL*
yet
I
shall
not
enjoy
a
moment
till
I
hear
my
old
*NL*
tarpaulins
tramping
round
the
capstan
.
Seaward
,
*NL*
ho
!
Hang
the
treasure
!
It
's
the
glory
of
the
sea
*NL*
that
has
turned
my
head
.
So
now
,
Livesey
,
come
*NL*
post
;
do
not
lose
an
hour
,
if
you
respect
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
young
Hawkins
go
at
once
to
see
his
*NL*
mother
,
with
Redruth
for
a
guard
;
and
then
both
*NL*
come
full
speed
to
Bristol
.

Postscript
--
I
did
not
tell
you
that
Blandly
,
*NL*
who
,
by
the
way
,
is
to
send
a
consort
after
us
if
*NL*
we
do
n't
turn
up
by
the
end
of
August
,
had
found
*NL*
an
admirable
fellow
for
sailing
master
--
a
stiff
*NL*
man
,
which
I
regret
,
but
in
all
other
respects
a
*NL*
treasure
.
Long
John
Silver
unearthed
a
very
*NL*
competent
man
for
a
mate
,
a
man
named
Arrow
.
I
*NL*
have
a
boatswain
who
pipes
,
Livesey
;
so
things
*NL*
shall
go
man-o
'
-
war
fashion
on
board
the
good
ship
*NL*
HISPANIOLA
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
forgot
to
tell
you
that
Silver
is
a
man
of
*NL*
substance
;
I
know
of
my
own
knowledge
that
he
has
*NL*
a
banker
's
account
,
which
has
never
been
*NL*
overdrawn
.
He
leaves
his
wife
to
manage
the
inn
;
*NL*
and
as
she
is
a
woman
of
colour
,
a
pair
of
old
*NL*
bachelors
like
you
and
I
may
be
excused
for
*NL*
guessing
that
it
is
the
wife
,
quite
as
much
as
the
*NL*
health
,
that
sends
him
back
to
roving
.

P.P.S.
--
Hawkins
may
stay
one
night
with
his
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
J.
T
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
can
fancy
the
excitement
into
which
that
letter
put
me
.
I
was
half
*NL*
beside
myself
with
glee
;
and
if
ever
I
despised
a
man
,
it
was
old
*NL*
Tom
Redruth
,
who
could
do
nothing
but
grumble
and
lament
.
Any
of
the
*NL*
under-gamekeepers
would
gladly
have
changed
places
with
him
;
but
such
*NL*
was
not
the
squire
's
pleasure
,
and
the
squire
's
pleasure
was
like
law
*NL*
among
them
all
.
Nobody
but
old
Redruth
would
have
dared
so
much
as
even
*NL*
to
grumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
he
and
I
set
out
on
foot
for
the
Admiral
Benbow
,
and
*NL*
there
I
found
my
mother
in
good
health
and
spirits
.
The
captain
,
who
had
*NL*
so
long
been
a
cause
of
so
much
discomfort
,
was
gone
where
the
wicked
*NL*
cease
from
troubling
.
The
squire
had
had
everything
repaired
,
and
the
*NL*
public
rooms
and
the
sign
repainted
,
and
had
added
some
furniture
--
above
*NL*
all
a
beautiful
armchair
for
mother
in
the
bar
.
He
had
found
her
a
boy
*NL*
as
an
apprentice
also
so
that
she
should
not
want
help
while
I
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
seeing
that
boy
that
I
understood
,
for
the
first
time
,
my
*NL*
situation
.
I
had
thought
up
to
that
moment
of
the
adventures
before
me
,
*NL*
not
at
all
of
the
home
that
I
was
leaving
;
and
now
,
at
sight
of
this
*NL*
clumsy
stranger
,
who
was
to
stay
here
in
my
place
beside
my
mother
,
I
*NL*
had
my
first
attack
of
tears
.
I
am
afraid
I
led
that
boy
a
dog
's
life
,
*NL*
for
as
he
was
new
to
the
work
,
I
had
a
hundred
opportunities
of
setting
*NL*
him
right
and
putting
him
down
,
and
I
was
not
slow
to
profit
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
passed
,
and
the
next
day
,
after
dinner
,
Redruth
and
I
were
*NL*
afoot
again
and
on
the
road
.
I
said
good-bye
to
Mother
and
the
*NL*
cove
where
I
had
lived
since
I
was
born
,
and
the
dear
old
Admiral
*NL*
Benbow
--
since
he
was
repainted
,
no
longer
quite
so
dear
.
One
of
my
last
*NL*
thoughts
was
of
the
captain
,
who
had
so
often
strode
along
the
beach
*NL*
with
his
cocked
hat
,
his
sabre-cut
cheek
,
and
his
old
brass
telescope
.
*NL*
Next
moment
we
had
turned
the
corner
and
my
home
was
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mail
picked
us
up
about
dusk
at
the
Royal
George
on
the
heath
.
I
was
*NL*
wedged
in
between
Redruth
and
a
stout
old
gentleman
,
and
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
swift
motion
and
the
cold
night
air
,
I
must
have
dozed
a
great
deal
from
*NL*
the
very
first
,
and
then
slept
like
a
log
up
hill
and
down
dale
through
*NL*
stage
after
stage
,
for
when
I
was
awakened
at
last
it
was
by
a
punch
*NL*
in
the
ribs
,
and
I
opened
my
eyes
to
find
that
we
were
standing
still
*NL*
before
a
large
building
in
a
city
street
and
that
the
day
had
already
*NL*
broken
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
we
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bristol
,
''
said
Tom
.
``
Get
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Trelawney
had
taken
up
his
residence
at
an
inn
far
down
the
docks
to
*NL*
superintend
the
work
upon
the
schooner
.
Thither
we
had
now
to
walk
,
and
*NL*
our
way
,
to
my
great
delight
,
lay
along
the
quays
and
beside
the
great
*NL*
multitude
of
ships
of
all
sizes
and
rigs
and
nations
.
In
one
,
sailors
*NL*
were
singing
at
their
work
,
in
another
there
were
men
aloft
,
high
over
*NL*
my
head
,
hanging
to
threads
that
seemed
no
thicker
than
a
spider
's
.
*NL*
Though
I
had
lived
by
the
shore
all
my
life
,
I
seemed
never
to
have
been
*NL*
near
the
sea
till
then
.
The
smell
of
tar
and
salt
was
something
new
.
*NL*
I
saw
the
most
wonderful
figureheads
,
that
had
all
been
far
over
the
*NL*
ocean
.
I
saw
,
besides
,
many
old
sailors
,
with
rings
in
their
ears
,
and
*NL*
whiskers
curled
in
ringlets
,
and
tarry
pigtails
,
and
their
swaggering
,
*NL*
clumsy
sea-walk
;
and
if
I
had
seen
as
many
kings
or
archbishops
I
could
*NL*
not
have
been
more
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
was
going
to
sea
myself
,
to
sea
in
a
schooner
,
with
a
piping
*NL*
boatswain
and
pig-tailed
singing
seamen
,
to
sea
,
bound
for
an
unknown
*NL*
island
,
and
to
seek
for
buried
treasure
!
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
still
in
this
delightful
dream
,
we
came
suddenly
in
front
*NL*
of
a
large
inn
and
met
Squire
Trelawney
,
all
dressed
out
like
a
*NL*
sea-officer
,
in
stout
blue
cloth
,
coming
out
of
the
door
with
a
smile
on
*NL*
his
face
and
a
capital
imitation
of
a
sailor
's
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
''
he
cried
,
``
and
the
doctor
came
last
night
from
London
.
*NL*
Bravo
!
The
ship
's
company
complete
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
sir
,
''
cried
I
,
``
when
do
we
sail
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sail
!
''
says
he
.
``
We
sail
tomorrow
!
''

*NL*
At
the
Sign
of
the
Spy-glass
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
I
had
done
breakfasting
the
squire
gave
me
a
note
addressed
to
John
*NL*
Silver
,
at
the
sign
of
the
Spy-glass
,
and
told
me
I
should
easily
*NL*
find
the
place
by
following
the
line
of
the
docks
and
keeping
a
bright
*NL*
lookout
for
a
little
tavern
with
a
large
brass
telescope
for
sign
.
I
*NL*
set
off
,
overjoyed
at
this
opportunity
to
see
some
more
of
the
ships
and
*NL*
seamen
,
and
picked
my
way
among
a
great
crowd
of
people
and
carts
and
*NL*
bales
,
for
the
dock
was
now
at
its
busiest
,
until
I
found
the
tavern
in
*NL*
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
bright
enough
little
place
of
entertainment
.
The
sign
was
*NL*
newly
painted
;
the
windows
had
neat
red
curtains
;
the
floor
was
cleanly
*NL*
sanded
.
There
was
a
street
on
each
side
and
an
open
door
on
both
,
which
*NL*
made
the
large
,
low
room
pretty
clear
to
see
in
,
in
spite
of
clouds
of
*NL*
tobacco
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
customers
were
mostly
seafaring
men
,
and
they
talked
so
loudly
that
*NL*
I
hung
at
the
door
,
almost
afraid
to
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
was
waiting
,
a
man
came
out
of
a
side
room
,
and
at
a
glance
I
was
*NL*
sure
he
must
be
Long
John
.
His
left
leg
was
cut
off
close
by
the
hip
,
*NL*
and
under
the
left
shoulder
he
carried
a
crutch
,
which
he
managed
with
*NL*
wonderful
dexterity
,
hopping
about
upon
it
like
a
bird
.
He
was
very
tall
*NL*
and
strong
,
with
a
face
as
big
as
a
ham
--
plain
and
pale
,
but
intelligent
*NL*
and
smiling
.
Indeed
,
he
seemed
in
the
most
cheerful
spirits
,
whistling
*NL*
as
he
moved
about
among
the
tables
,
with
a
merry
word
or
a
slap
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
for
the
more
favoured
of
his
guests
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
to
tell
you
the
truth
,
from
the
very
first
mention
of
Long
John
in
*NL*
Squire
Trelawney
's
letter
I
had
taken
a
fear
in
my
mind
that
he
might
*NL*
prove
to
be
the
very
one-legged
sailor
whom
I
had
watched
for
so
long
at
*NL*
the
old
Benbow
.
But
one
look
at
the
man
before
me
was
enough
.
I
had
seen
*NL*
the
captain
,
and
Black
Dog
,
and
the
blind
man
,
Pew
,
and
I
thought
I
knew
*NL*
what
a
buccaneer
was
like
--
a
very
different
creature
,
according
to
me
,
*NL*
from
this
clean
and
pleasant-tempered
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
plucked
up
courage
at
once
,
crossed
the
threshold
,
and
walked
right
up
*NL*
to
the
man
where
he
stood
,
propped
on
his
crutch
,
talking
to
a
customer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Silver
,
sir
?
''
I
asked
,
holding
out
the
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
lad
,
''
said
he
;
``
such
is
my
name
,
to
be
sure
.
And
who
may
you
*NL*
be
?
''
And
then
as
he
saw
the
squire
's
letter
,
he
seemed
to
me
to
give
*NL*
something
almost
like
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
he
,
quite
loud
,
and
offering
his
hand
.
``
I
see
.
You
are
our
*NL*
new
cabin-boy
;
pleased
I
am
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
took
my
hand
in
his
large
firm
grasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
one
of
the
customers
at
the
far
side
rose
suddenly
and
made
*NL*
for
the
door
.
It
was
close
by
him
,
and
he
was
out
in
the
street
in
a
*NL*
moment
.
But
his
hurry
had
attracted
my
notice
,
and
I
recognized
him
at
*NL*
glance
.
It
was
the
tallow-faced
man
,
wanting
two
fingers
,
who
had
come
*NL*
first
to
the
Admiral
Benbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
''
I
cried
,
``
stop
him
!
It
's
Black
Dog
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
two
coppers
who
he
is
,
''
cried
Silver
.
``
But
he
has
n't
paid
*NL*
his
score
.
Harry
,
run
and
catch
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
others
who
was
nearest
the
door
leaped
up
and
started
in
*NL*
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
were
Admiral
Hawke
he
shall
pay
his
score
,
''
cried
Silver
;
and
*NL*
then
,
relinquishing
my
hand
,
``
Who
did
you
say
he
was
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Black
*NL*
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dog
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
``
Has
Mr.
Trelawney
not
told
you
of
the
buccaneers
?
*NL*
He
was
one
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
?
''
cried
Silver
.
``
In
my
house
!
Ben
,
run
and
help
Harry

One
of
those
*NL*
swabs
,
was
he
?
Was
that
you
drinking
with
him
,
Morgan
?
Step
up
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
whom
he
called
Morgan
--
an
old
,
grey-haired
,
mahogany-faced
*NL*
sailor
--
came
forward
pretty
sheepishly
,
rolling
his
quid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Morgan
,
''
said
Long
John
very
sternly
,
``
you
never
clapped
your
eyes
*NL*
on
that
Black
--
Black
Dog
before
,
did
you
,
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I

said
Morgan
with
a
salute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
powers
,
Tom
Morgan
,
it
's
as
good
for
you
!
''
exclaimed
the
*NL*
landlord
.
``
If
you
had
been
mixed
up
with
the
like
of
that
,
you
would
*NL*
never
have
put
another
foot
in
my
house
,
you
may
lay
to
that
.
And
what
*NL*
was
he
saying
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
rightly
know
,
sir

''
answered
Morgan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
that
a
head
on
your
shoulders

or
a
blessed
dead-eye

*NL*
cried
Long
John
.
``
Do

Perhaps
you
do
n't
*NL*
happen
to
rightly

you
was
speaking
to

perhaps
?
Come
,
now
,
what
*NL*
was
he
jawing

up

What
was
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
was
a-talkin

of
keel-hauling

answered
Morgan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keel-hauling
,
was
you
?
And
a
mighty
suitable
thing
,
too
,
and
you

*NL*
lay

that
.
Get
back
to
your
place
for
a
lubber
,
Tom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
as
Morgan
rolled
back
to
his
seat
,
Silver
added
to
me
in
a
*NL*
confidential
whisper
that
was
very
flattering
,
as
I
thought
,
``
He
's
*NL*
quite
an
honest
man
,
Tom
Morgan
,
on
'
y
stupid
.
And
now
,
''
he
ran
on
again
,
*NL*
aloud
,
``
let
's
see
--
Black
Dog
?
No
,
I
do
n't
know
the
name
,
not
I
.
Yet
I
*NL*
kind
of
think
I
've
--
yes
,
I
've
seen
the
swab
.
He
used
to
come
here
with
a
*NL*
blind
beggar
,
he
used
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
he
did
,
you
may
be
sure
,
''
said
I.
``
I
knew
that
blind
man
too
.
His
*NL*
name
was
Pew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
!
''
cried
Silver
,
now
quite
excited
.
``
Pew
!
That
were
his
name
for
*NL*
certain
.
Ah
,
he
looked
a
shark
,
he
did
!
If
we
run
down
this
Black
Dog
,
*NL*
now
,
there
'll
be
news
for
Cap'n
Trelawney
!
Ben
's
a
good
runner
;
few
*NL*
seamen
run
better
than
Ben
.
He
should
run
him
down
,
hand
over
hand
,
by
*NL*
the
powers
!
He
talked
o
'
keel-hauling
,
did
he
?
I
'LL
keel-haul
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
he
was
jerking
out
these
phrases
he
was
stumping
up
and
*NL*
down
the
tavern
on
his
crutch
,
slapping
tables
with
his
hand
,
and
giving
*NL*
such
a
show
of
excitement
as
would
have
convinced
an
Old
Bailey
judge
*NL*
or
a
Bow
Street
runner
.
My
suspicions
had
been
thoroughly
reawakened
on
*NL*
finding
Black
Dog
at
the
Spy-glass
,
and
I
watched
the
cook
narrowly
.
But
*NL*
he
was
too
deep
,
and
too
ready
,
and
too
clever
for
me
,
and
by
the
time
*NL*
the
two
men
had
come
back
out
of
breath
and
confessed
that
they
had
lost
*NL*
the
track
in
a
crowd
,
and
been
scolded
like
thieves
,
I
would
have
gone
*NL*
bail
for
the
innocence
of
Long
John
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
,
now
,
Hawkins
,
''
said
he
,
``
here
's
a
blessed
hard
thing
on
a
*NL*
man
like
me
,
now
,
ai
n't
it
?
There
's
Cap'n
Trelawney
--
what
's
he
to
think
?
*NL*
Here
I
have
this
confounded
son
of
a
Dutchman
sitting
in
my
own
house
*NL*
drinking
of
my
own
rum
!
Here
you
comes
and
tells
me
of
it
plain
;
and
*NL*
here
I
let
him
give
us
all
the
slip
before
my
blessed
deadlights
!
Now
,
*NL*
Hawkins
,
you
do
me
justice
with
the
cap'n
.
You
're
a
lad
,
you
are
,
but
*NL*
you
're
as
smart
as
paint
.
I
see
that
when
you
first
come
in
.
Now
,
here
*NL*
it
is
:
What
could
I
do
,
with
this
old
timber
I
hobble
on
?
When
I
was
an
*NL*
A
B
master
mariner
I
'd
have
come
up
alongside
of
him
,
hand
over
hand
,
*NL*
and
broached
him
to
in
a
brace
of
old
shakes
,
I
would
;
but
now
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
stopped
,
and
his
jaw
dropped
as
though
he
*NL*
had
remembered
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
score
!
''
he
burst
out
.
``
Three
goes
o
'
rum
!
Why
,
shiver
my
timbers
,
*NL*
if
I
had
n't
forgotten
my
score
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
falling
on
a
bench
,
he
laughed
until
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
.
*NL*
I
could
not
help
joining
,
and
we
laughed
together
,
peal
after
peal
,
*NL*
until
the
tavern
rang
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
what
a
precious
old
sea-calf
I
am
!
''
he
said
at
last
,
wiping
his
*NL*
cheeks
.
``
You
and
me
should
get
on
well
,
Hawkins
,
for
I
'll
take
my
davy
*NL*
I
should
be
rated
ship
's
boy
.
But
come
now
,
stand
by
to
go
about
.
This
*NL*
wo
n't
do
.
Dooty
is
dooty
,
messmates
.
I
'll
put
on
my
old
cockerel
hat
,
*NL*
and
step
along
of
you
to
Cap'n
Trelawney
,
and
report
this
here
affair
.
*NL*
For
mind
you
,
it
's
serious
,
young
Hawkins
;
and
neither
you
nor
me
's
come
*NL*
out
of
it
with
what
I
should
make
so
bold
as
to
call
credit
.
Nor
you
*NL*
neither
,
says
you
;
not
smart
--
none
of
the
pair
of
us
smart
.
But
dash
my
*NL*
buttons
!
That
was
a
good
un
about
my
score
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
to
laugh
again
,
and
that
so
heartily
,
that
though
I
did
not
*NL*
see
the
joke
as
he
did
,
I
was
again
obliged
to
join
him
in
his
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
our
little
walk
along
the
quays
,
he
made
himself
the
most
interesting
*NL*
companion
,
telling
me
about
the
different
ships
that
we
passed
by
,
*NL*
their
rig
,
tonnage
,
and
nationality
,
explaining
the
work
that
was
going
*NL*
forward
--
how
one
was
discharging
,
another
taking
in
cargo
,
and
a
third
*NL*
making
ready
for
sea
--
and
every
now
and
then
telling
me
some
little
*NL*
anecdote
of
ships
or
seamen
or
repeating
a
nautical
phrase
till
I
had
*NL*
learned
it
perfectly
.
I
began
to
see
that
here
was
one
of
the
best
of
*NL*
possible
shipmates
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
got
to
the
inn
,
the
squire
and
Dr.
Livesey
were
seated
together
,
*NL*
finishing
a
quart
of
ale
with
a
toast
in
it
,
before
they
should
go
*NL*
aboard
the
schooner
on
a
visit
of
inspection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
John
told
the
story
from
first
to
last
,
with
a
great
deal
of
spirit
*NL*
and
the
most
perfect
truth
.
``
That
was
how
it
were
,
now
,
were
n't
it
,
*NL*
Hawkins
?
''
he
would
say
,
now
and
again
,
and
I
could
always
bear
him
*NL*
entirely
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
gentlemen
regretted
that
Black
Dog
had
got
away
,
but
we
all
*NL*
agreed
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
,
and
after
he
had
been
complimented
,
*NL*
Long
John
took
up
his
crutch
and
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
hands
aboard
by
four
this
afternoon

''
shouted
the
squire
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye

sir
,
''
cried
the
cook
,
in
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
squire
,
''
said
Dr.
Livesey
,
``
I
do
n't
put
much
faith

your

discoveries

John
Silver
suits

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
's
a
perfect
trump

declared
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now

''
added
the
doctor
,
``
Jim
may
come
on
board
with
us

may
he
*NL*
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be

he
may

says
squire

``
Take
your

*NL*
*NL*
Powder
and
Arms
*NL*
*NL*
THE
HISPANIOLA
lay
some
way
out
,
and
we
went
under
the
figureheads
and
*NL*
round
the
sterns
of
many
other
ships
,
and
their
cables
sometimes
grated
*NL*
underneath
our
keel
,
and
sometimes
swung
above
us
.
At
last
,
however
,
*NL*
we
got
alongside
,
and
were
met
and
saluted
as
we
stepped
aboard
by
the
*NL*
mate
,
Mr.
Arrow
,
a
brown
old
sailor
with
earrings
in
his
ears
and
a
*NL*
squint
.
He
and
the
squire
were
very
thick
and
friendly
,
but
I
soon
*NL*
observed
that
things
were
not
the
same
between
Mr.
Trelawney
and
the
*NL*
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
was
a
sharp-looking
man
who
seemed
angry
with
everything
on
*NL*
board
and
was
soon
to
tell
us
why
,
for
we
had
hardly
got
down
into
the
*NL*
cabin
when
a
sailor
followed
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Smollett
,
sir
,
axing
to
speak
with
you

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
always
at
the
captain
's
orders

Show
him
in

said
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
who
was
close
behind
his
messenger
,
entered
at
once
and
*NL*
shut
the
door
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Captain
Smollett
,
what
have
you
to
say
?
All
well

I
hope
;
all
*NL*
shipshape
and
seaworthy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
better
speak
plain
,
I
believe
,
even
at
*NL*
the
risk
of
offence
.
I
do
n't
like
this
cruise
;
I
do
n't
like
the
men
;
and
*NL*
I
do
n't
like
my
officer

That
's
short
and
sweet

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
sir
,
you
do
n't
like
the
ship
?
''
inquired
the
squire
,
very
*NL*
angry
,
as
I
could
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
speak
as
to
that

not
having
seen
her
tried

said
the
*NL*
captain
.
``
She
seems
a
clever
craft
;
more
I
ca
n't
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
,
sir
,
you
may
not
like
your
employer

either

says
the
*NL*
squire

*NL*
*NL*
But
here
Dr.
Livesey
cut
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
a
bit

''
said
he
,
``
stay
a
bit

No
use
of
such
questions
as
that

*NL*
to
produce
ill
feeling

has
said
too
much
or
he
has
said
too
*NL*
little

and
I
'm
bound
to
say
that
I
require
an
explanation
of
his
words

*NL*
You
do

why

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
captain
.
``
So
far

good

I

I

*NL*

the

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
way
of
speaking

said
the
captain

``
Blabbed

I

It
's
my
*NL*
belief
neither
of
you

know
what
you
are
about

but
I
'll
tell
*NL*
you
my
way
of
it

life
or
death
,
and
a
close
run

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
all
clear

I
dare

true
enough

replied
Dr.
Livesey
.
*NL*
``
We
take
the
risk

we
are
not

you
do
n't
like
the

Are
they
not
good
seamen

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

like
them

returned
Captain
Smollett
.
``
And
I
think
I

should
have
had
the
choosing

*NL*
*NL*

Perhaps

the
doctor

``
My

have
taken
you
along
with
him

the
slight

was

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

I
believe
he
's
a
good
seaman
,
but
he
's
too
free
with
*NL*
the
crew
to
be
a
good
officer
.
A
mate
should
keep
himself
to
*NL*
himself
--
should
n't
drink
with
the
men
before
the
mast
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
he
drinks
?
''
cried
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir

''
replied
the
captain

``
only
that
he
's

familiar

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

now
,
and
the
short
and
long
of

asked
the

Tell

*NL*

are
you
determined

*NL*
*NL*
``
Like

''
answered
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
the

``
Then
,
as
you
've
heard
me
very
patiently

*NL*
saying
things
that
I
could
not
prove

hear
me
a
few
words
more
.
They
are
*NL*
putting
the
powder
and
the
arms
in
the
fore
hold
.
Now
,
you
have
a
good
*NL*
place
under
the
cabin
;
why
not
put
them
there
?

first
point
.
Then
,
you
*NL*
are
bringing
four
of
your
own
people
with
you
,
and
they
tell
me
some
of
*NL*
them
are
to
be
berthed
forward
.
Why
not
give
them
the
berths
here
beside
*NL*
the
cabin
?

second
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
more
?
''
asked
Mr.
Trelawney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
more
,

said
the
captain
.
``
There
's
been
too
much
blabbing
already
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
too
much
,
''
agreed
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
've
heard
myself
,
''
continued
Captain
Smollett
:
*NL*
``
that
you
have
a
map
of
an
island
,
that
there
's
crosses
on
the
map
to
*NL*
show
where
treasure
is
,
and
that
the
island
lies
--
''
And
then
he
named
*NL*
the
latitude
and
longitude
exactly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
told
that
,
''
cried
the
squire
,
``
to
a
soul
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hands
know
it
,
sir
,
''
returned
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Livesey
,
that
must
have
been
you
or
Hawkins
,
''
cried
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
much
matter
who
it
was
,
''
replied
the
doctor
.
And
I
could
*NL*
see
that
neither
he
nor
the
captain
paid
much
regard
to
Mr.
Trelawney
's
*NL*
protestations
.
Neither
did
I
,
to
be
sure
,
he
was
so
loose
a
talker
;
yet
*NL*
in
this
case
I
believe
he
was
really
right
and
that
nobody
had
told
the
*NL*
situation
of
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
gentlemen
,
''
continued
the
captain
,
``
I
do
n't
know
who
has
this
*NL*
map
;
but
I
make
it
a
point
,
it
shall
be
kept
secret
even
from
me
and
Mr.
*NL*
Arrow
.
Otherwise
I
would
ask
you
to
let
me
resign
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
You
wish
us
to
keep
this
matter
dark
and
to
*NL*
make
a
garrison
of
the
stern
part
of
the
ship
,
manned
with
my
friend
's
*NL*
own
people
,
and
provided
with
all
the
arms
and
powder
on
board
.
In
other
*NL*
words
,
you
fear
a
mutiny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

''
said
Captain
Smollett
,
``
with
no
intention
to
take
offence
,
I
*NL*
deny
your
right
to
put
words
into
my
mouth

No
captain
,
sir
,
would
be
*NL*
justified
in
going
to
sea
at
all
if
he
had
ground
enough
to
say
that
.
As
*NL*
for
Mr.
Arrow
,
I
believe
him
thoroughly
honest
;
some
of
the
men
are
the
*NL*
same
;
all
may
be
for
what
I
know
.
But
I
am
responsible
for
the
ship
's
*NL*
safety
and
the
life
of
every
man
Jack
aboard
of
her
.
I
see
things
going
,
*NL*
as
I
think
,
not
quite
right
.
And
I
ask
you
to
take
certain
precautions
*NL*
or
let
me
resign
my
berth
.
And
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
Smollett
,
''
began
the
doctor
with
a
smile
,
``
did
ever
you
hear
*NL*
the
fable
of
the
mountain
and
the
mouse
?
You
'll
excuse
me
,
I
dare
say
,
*NL*
but
you
remind
me
of
that
fable
.
When
you
came
in
here
,
I
'll
stake
my
*NL*
wig
,
you
meant
more
than
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
you
are
smart
.
When
I
came
in
here
I
meant

to
get
discharged

I
had
no

Mr.
Trelawney
would
hear

word

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
I
would

cried
the
squire
.
``
Had

not
been
here

should

it
is

have
heard

I
will
do

worse
of

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
as

said
the
captain
.
``
You
'll
find
I
do
my
*NL*
duty

*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
he
took
his
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Trelawney
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
contrary
to
all
my
notions

I
believed
*NL*
you
have
managed
to
get
two
honest
men
on
board
with

--
that
man
and
*NL*
John
Silver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silver
,
if
you
like
,
''
cried
the
squire
;
``
but
as
for
that
intolerable
*NL*
humbug
,
I
declare
I
think
his
conduct
unmanly
,
unsailorly
,
and
downright
*NL*
un-English
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
the
doctor
,
``
we
shall
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
came
on
deck
,
the
men
had
begun
already
to
take
out
the
arms
and
*NL*
powder
,
yo-ho-ing
at
their
work
,
while
the
captain
and
Mr.
Arrow
stood
*NL*
by
superintending
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new
arrangement
was
quite
to
my
liking
.
The
whole
schooner
had
been
*NL*
overhauled
;
six
berths
had
been
made
astern
out
of
what
had
been
the
*NL*
after-part
of
the
main
hold
;
and
this
set
of
cabins
was
only
joined
to
*NL*
the
galley
and
forecastle
by
a
sparred
passage
on
the
port
side
.
It
had
*NL*
been
originally
meant
that
the
captain
,
Mr.
Arrow
,
Hunter
,
Joyce
,
the
*NL*
doctor
,
and
the
squire
were
to
occupy
these
six
berths
.
Now
Redruth
and
*NL*
I
were
to
get
two
of
them
and
Mr.
Arrow
and
the
captain
were
to
sleep
*NL*
on
deck
in
the
companion
,
which
had
been
enlarged
on
each
side
till
you
*NL*
might
almost
have
called
it
a
round-house
.
Very
low
it
was
still
,
of
*NL*
course
;
but
there
was
room
to
swing
two
hammocks
,
and
even
the
mate
*NL*
seemed
pleased
with
the
arrangement
.
Even
he
,
perhaps
,
had
been
doubtful
*NL*
as
to
the
crew
,
but
that
is
only
guess
,
for
as
you
shall
hear
,
we
had
*NL*
not
long
the
benefit
of
his
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
all
hard
at
work
,
changing
the
powder
and
the
berths
,
when
*NL*
the
last
man
or
two
,
and
Long
John
along
with
them
,
came
off
in
a
*NL*
shore-boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cook
came
up
the
side
like
a
monkey
for
cleverness
,
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
he
saw
what
was
doing
,
``
So
ho
,
mates
!
''
says
he
.
``
What
's
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
a-changing
of
the
powder
,
Jack
,
''
answers
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
by
the
powers
,
''
cried
Long
John
,
``
if
we
do
,
we
'll
miss
the
morning
*NL*
tide
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
orders
!
''
said
the
captain
shortly
.
``
You
may
go
below
,
my
man
.
Hands
*NL*
will
want
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
sir
,
''
answered
the
cook
,
and
touching
his
forelock
,
he
*NL*
disappeared
at
once
in
the
direction
of
his
galley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
good
man
,
captain
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely
,
sir
,
''
replied
Captain
Smollett
.
``
Easy
with
that
,
*NL*
men
--
easy
,
''
he
ran
on
,
to
the
fellows
who
were
shifting
the
powder
;
and
*NL*
then
suddenly
observing
me
examining
the
swivel
we
carried
amidships
,
*NL*
a
long
brass
nine
,
``
Here
you
,
ship
's
boy
,
''
he
cried
,
``
out
o
'
that
!
Off
*NL*
with
you
to
the
cook
and
get
some
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
as
I
was
hurrying
off
I
heard
him
say
,
quite
loudly
,
to
the
*NL*
doctor
,
``
I
'll
have
no
favourites
on
my
ship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
assure
you
I
was
quite
of
the
squire
's
way
of
thinking
,
and
hated
the
*NL*
captain
deeply
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
Voyage
*NL*
*NL*
ALL
that
night
we
were
in
a
great
bustle
getting
things
stowed
in
their
*NL*
place
,
and
boatfuls
of
the
squire
's
friends
,
Mr.
Blandly
and
the
like
,
*NL*
coming
off
to
wish
him
a
good
voyage
and
a
safe
return
.
We
never
had
*NL*
a
night
at
the
Admiral
Benbow
when
I
had
half
the
work
;
and
I
was
*NL*
dog-tired
when
,
a
little
before
dawn
,
the
boatswain
sounded
his
pipe
*NL*
and
the
crew
began
to
man
the
capstan-bars
.
I
might
have
been
twice
*NL*
as
weary
,
yet
I
would
not
have
left
the
deck
,
all
was
so
new
and
*NL*
interesting
to
me
--
the
brief
commands
,
the
shrill
note
of
the
whistle
,
*NL*
the
men
bustling
to
their
places
in
the
glimmer
of
the
ship
's
lanterns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Barbecue
,
tip
us
a
stave
,
''
cried
one
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
one
,
''
cried
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
mates
,
''
said
Long
John
,
who
was
standing
by
,
with
his
crutch
*NL*
under
his
arm
,
and
at
once
broke
out
in
the
air
and
words
I
knew
so
*NL*
well
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
men
on
the
dead
man
's
chest
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
the
whole
crew
bore
chorus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yo-ho-ho
,
and
a
bottle
of
rum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
the
third
``
Ho
!
''
drove
the
bars
before
them
with
a
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
at
that
exciting
moment
it
carried
me
back
to
the
old
Admiral
*NL*
Benbow
in
a
second
,
and
I
seemed
to
hear
the
voice
of
the
captain
piping
*NL*
in
the
chorus
.
But
soon
the
anchor
was
short
up
;
soon
it
was
hanging
*NL*
dripping
at
the
bows
;
soon
the
sails
began
to
draw
,
and
the
land
and
*NL*
shipping
to
flit
by
on
either
side
;
and
before
I
could
lie
down
to
*NL*
snatch
an
hour
of
slumber
the
HISPANIOLA
had
begun
her
voyage
to
the
*NL*
Isle
of
Treasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
going
to
relate
that
voyage
in
detail
.
It
was
fairly
*NL*
prosperous
.
The
ship
proved
to
be
a
good
ship
,
the
crew
were
capable
*NL*
seamen
,
and
the
captain
thoroughly
understood
his
business
.
But
before
*NL*
we
came
the
length
of
Treasure
Island
,
two
or
three
things
had
happened
*NL*
which
require
to
be
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Arrow
,
first
of
all
,
turned
out
even
worse
than
the
captain
had
*NL*
feared
.
He
had
no
command
among
the
men
,
and
people
did
what
they
*NL*
pleased
with
him
.
But
that
was
by
no
means
the
worst
of
it
,
for
after
a
*NL*
day
or
two
at
sea
he
began
to
appear
on
deck
with
hazy
eye
,
red
cheeks
,
*NL*
stuttering
tongue
,
and
other
marks
of
drunkenness
.
Time
after
time
*NL*
he
was
ordered
below
in
disgrace
.
Sometimes
he
fell
and
cut
himself
;
*NL*
sometimes
he
lay
all
day
long
in
his
little
bunk
at
one
side
of
the
*NL*
companion
;
sometimes
for
a
day
or
two
he
would
be
almost
sober
and
*NL*
attend
to
his
work
at
least
passably
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
we
could
never
make
out
where
he
got
the
drink
.
That
*NL*
was
the
ship
's
mystery
.
Watch
him
as
we
pleased
,
we
could
do
nothing
to
*NL*
solve
it
;
and
when
we
asked
him
to
his
face
,
he
would
only
laugh
if
*NL*
he
were
drunk
,
and
if
he
were
sober
deny
solemnly
that
he
ever
tasted
*NL*
anything
but
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
only
useless
as
an
officer
and
a
bad
influence
amongst
*NL*
the
men
,
but
it
was
plain
that
at
this
rate
he
must
soon
kill
himself
*NL*
outright
,
so
nobody
was
much
surprised
,
nor
very
sorry
,
when
one
dark
*NL*
night
,
with
a
head
sea
,
he
disappeared
entirely
and
was
seen
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Overboard
!
''
said
the
captain
.
``
Well
,
gentlemen
,
that
saves
the
trouble
*NL*
of
putting
him
in
irons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
we
were
,
without
a
mate
;
and
it
was
necessary
,
of
course
,
to
*NL*
advance
one
of
the
men
.
The
boatswain
,
Job
Anderson
,
was
the
likeliest
*NL*
man
aboard
,
and
though
he
kept
his
old
title
,
he
served
in
a
way
as
*NL*
mate
.
Mr.
Trelawney
had
followed
the
sea
,
and
his
knowledge
made
him
*NL*
very
useful
,
for
he
often
took
a
watch
himself
in
easy
weather
.
And
the
*NL*
coxswain
,
Israel
Hands
,
was
a
careful
,
wily
,
old
,
experienced
seaman
who
*NL*
could
be
trusted
at
a
pinch
with
almost
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
great
confidant
of
Long
John
Silver
,
and
so
the
mention
of
*NL*
his
name
leads
me
on
to
speak
of
our
ship
's
cook
,
Barbecue
,
as
the
men
*NL*
called
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aboard
ship
he
carried
his
crutch
by
a
lanyard
round
his
neck
,
to
have
*NL*
both
hands
as
free
as
possible
.
It
was
something
to
see
him
wedge
the
*NL*
foot
of
the
crutch
against
a
bulkhead
,
and
propped
against
it
,
yielding
*NL*
to
every
movement
of
the
ship
,
get
on
with
his
cooking
like
someone
safe
*NL*
ashore
.
Still
more
strange
was
it
to
see
him
in
the
heaviest
of
weather
*NL*
cross
the
deck
.
He
had
a
line
or
two
rigged
up
to
help
him
across
the
*NL*
widest
spaces
--
Long
John
's
earrings
,
they
were
called
;
and
he
would
hand
*NL*
himself
from
one
place
to
another
,
now
using
the
crutch
,
now
trailing
it
*NL*
alongside
by
the
lanyard
,
as
quickly
as
another
man
could
walk
.
Yet
some
*NL*
of
the
men
who
had
sailed
with
him
before
expressed
their
pity
to
see
*NL*
him
so
reduced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
no
common
man
,
Barbecue
,
''
said
the
coxswain
to
me
.
``
He
had
good
*NL*
schooling
in
his
young
days
and
can
speak
like
a
book
when
so
minded
;
*NL*
and
brave
--
a
lion
's
nothing
alongside
of
Long
John
!
I
seen
him
grapple
*NL*
four
and
knock
their
heads
together
--
him
unarmed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
crew
respected
and
even
obeyed
him
.
He
had
a
way
of
talking
*NL*
to
each
and
doing
everybody
some
particular
service
.
To
me
he
was
*NL*
unweariedly
kind
,
and
always
glad
to
see
me
in
the
galley
,
which
he
kept
*NL*
as
clean
as
a
new
pin
,
the
dishes
hanging
up
burnished
and
his
parrot
in
*NL*
a
cage
in
one
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
away
,
Hawkins
,
''
he
would
say
;
``
come
and
have
a
yarn
with
John
.
*NL*
Nobody
more
welcome
than
yourself
,
my
son
.
Sit
you
down
and
hear
the
*NL*
news
.
Here
's
Cap'n
Flint
--
I
calls
my
parrot
Cap'n
Flint
,
after
the
*NL*
famous
buccaneer
--
here
's
Cap'n
Flint
predicting
success
to
our
v
`
yage
.
*NL*
Was
n't
you
,
cap'n
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
parrot
would
say
,
with
great
rapidity
,
``
Pieces
of
eight
!
Pieces
*NL*
of
eight
!
Pieces
of
eight
!
''
till
you
wondered
that
it
was
not
out
of
*NL*
breath
,
or
till
John
threw
his
handkerchief
over
the
cage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
that
bird
,
''
he
would
say
,
``
is
,
maybe
,
two
hundred
years
*NL*
old
,
Hawkins
--
they
live
forever
mostly
;
and
if
anybody
's
seen
more
*NL*
wickedness
,
it
must
be
the
devil
himself
.
She
's
sailed
with
England
,
*NL*
the
great
Cap'n
England
,
the
pirate
.
She
's
been
at
Madagascar
,
and
at
*NL*
Malabar
,
and
Surinam
,
and
Providence
,
and
Portobello
.
She
was
at
the
*NL*
fishing
up
of
the
wrecked
plate
ships
.
It
's
there
she
learned
`
Pieces
*NL*
of
eight
,
'
and
little
wonder
;
three
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
of
'em
,
*NL*
Hawkins
!
She
was
at
the
boarding
of
the
viceroy
of
the
Indies
out
of
*NL*
Goa
,
she
was
;
and
to
look
at
her
you
would
think
she
was
a
babby
.
But
*NL*
you
smelt
powder
--
did
n't
you
,
cap'n
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
by
to
go
about
,
''
the
parrot
would
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
she
's
a
handsome
craft
,
she
is
,
''
the
cook
would
say
,
and
give
her
*NL*
sugar
from
his
pocket
,
and
then
the
bird
would
peck
at
the
bars
and
*NL*
swear
straight
on
,
passing
belief
for
wickedness
.
``
There
,
''
John
would
*NL*
add
,
``
you
ca
n't
touch
pitch
and
not
be
mucked
,
lad
.
Here
's
this
poor
old
*NL*
innocent
bird
o
'
mine
swearing
blue
fire
,
and
none
the
wiser
,
you
may
*NL*
lay
to
that
.
She
would
swear
the
same
,
in
a
manner
of
speaking
,
before
*NL*
chaplain
.
''
And
John
would
touch
his
forelock
with
a
solemn
way
he
had
*NL*
that
made
me
think
he
was
the
best
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
squire
and
Captain
Smollett
were
still
on
pretty
*NL*
distant
terms
with
one
another
.
The
squire
made
no
bones
about
the
*NL*
matter
;
he
despised
the
captain
.
The
captain
,
on
his
part
,
never
spoke
*NL*
but
when
he
was
spoken
to
,
and
then
sharp
and
short
and
dry
,
and
not
a
*NL*
word
wasted
.
He
owned
,
when
driven
into
a
corner
,
that
he
seemed
to
have
*NL*
been
wrong
about
the
crew
,
that
some
of
them
were
as
brisk
as
he
wanted
*NL*
to
see
and
all
had
behaved
fairly
well
.
As
for
the
ship
,
he
had
taken
a
*NL*
downright
fancy
to
her
.
``
She
'll
lie
a
point
nearer
the
wind
than
a
man
*NL*
has
a
right
to
expect
of
his
own
married
wife
,
sir
.
But
,
''
he
would
add
,
*NL*
``
all
I
say
is
,
we
're
not
home
again
,
and
I
do
n't
like
the
cruise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
,
at
this
,
would
turn
away
and
march
up
and
down
the
deck
,
*NL*
chin
in
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
trifle
more
of
that
man
,
''
he
would
say
,
``
and
I
shall
explode
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
some
heavy
weather
,
which
only
proved
the
qualities
of
the
*NL*
HISPANIOLA
.
Every
man
on
board
seemed
well
content
,
and
they
must
have
*NL*
been
hard
to
please
if
they
had
been
otherwise
,
for
it
is
my
belief
*NL*
there
was
never
a
ship
's
company
so
spoiled
since
Noah
put
to
sea
.
*NL*
Double
grog
was
going
on
the
least
excuse
;
there
was
duff
on
odd
days
,
*NL*
as
,
for
instance
,
if
the
squire
heard
it
was
any
man
's
birthday
,
and
*NL*
always
a
barrel
of
apples
standing
broached
in
the
waist
for
anyone
to
*NL*
help
himself
that
had
a
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
knew
good
come
of
it
yet
,
''
the
captain
said
to
Dr.
Livesey
.
*NL*
``
Spoil
forecastle
hands
,
make
devils
.
That
's
my
belief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
good
did
come
of
the
apple
barrel
,
as
you
shall
hear
,
for
if
it
had
*NL*
not
been
for
that
,
we
should
have
had
no
note
of
warning
and
might
all
*NL*
have
perished
by
the
hand
of
treachery
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
how
it
came
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
run
up
the
trades
to
get
the
wind
of
the
island
we
were
after
--
I
*NL*
am
not
allowed
to
be
more
plain
--
and
now
we
were
running
down
for
it
*NL*
with
a
bright
lookout
day
and
night
.
It
was
about
the
last
day
of
our
*NL*
outward
voyage
by
the
largest
computation
;
some
time
that
night
,
or
at
*NL*
latest
before
noon
of
the
morrow
,
we
should
sight
the
Treasure
Island
.
*NL*
We
were
heading
S.S.W.
and
had
a
steady
breeze
abeam
and
a
quiet
sea
.
*NL*
The
HISPANIOLA
rolled
steadily
,
dipping
her
bowsprit
now
and
then
with
*NL*
a
whiff
of
spray
.
All
was
drawing
alow
and
aloft
;
everyone
was
in
the
*NL*
bravest
spirits
because
we
were
now
so
near
an
end
of
the
first
part
of
*NL*
our
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
just
after
sundown
,
when
all
my
work
was
over
and
I
was
on
my
way
*NL*
to
my
berth
,
it
occurred
to
me
that
I
should
like
an
apple
.
I
ran
on
*NL*
deck
.
The
watch
was
all
forward
looking
out
for
the
island
.
The
man
at
*NL*
the
helm
was
watching
the
luff
of
the
sail
and
whistling
away
gently
*NL*
to
himself
,
and
that
was
the
only
sound
excepting
the
swish
of
the
sea
*NL*
against
the
bows
and
around
the
sides
of
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
I
got
bodily
into
the
apple
barrel
,
and
found
there
was
scarce
an
*NL*
apple
left
;
but
sitting
down
there
in
the
dark
,
what
with
the
sound
of
*NL*
the
waters
and
the
rocking
movement
of
the
ship
,
I
had
either
fallen
*NL*
asleep
or
was
on
the
point
of
doing
so
when
a
heavy
man
sat
down
with
*NL*
rather
a
clash
close
by
.
The
barrel
shook
as
he
leaned
his
shoulders
*NL*
against
it
,
and
I
was
just
about
to
jump
up
when
the
man
began
to
speak
.
*NL*
It
was
Silver
's
voice
,
and
before
I
had
heard
a
dozen
words
,
I
would
*NL*
not
have
shown
myself
for
all
the
world
,
but
lay
there
,
trembling
and
*NL*
listening
,
in
the
extreme
of
fear
and
curiosity
,
for
from
these
dozen
*NL*
words
I
understood
that
the
lives
of
all
the
honest
men
aboard
depended
*NL*
upon
me
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
What
I
Heard
in
the
Apple
Barrel
*NL*
*NL*
``
NO
,
not
I
,
''
said
Silver
.
``
Flint
was
cap'n
;
I
was
quartermaster
,
along
*NL*
of
my
timber
leg
.
The
same
broadside
I
lost
my
leg
,
old
Pew
lost
his
*NL*
deadlights
.
It
was
a
master
surgeon
,
him
that
ampytated
me
--
out
of
*NL*
college
and
all
--
Latin
by
the
bucket
,
and
what
not
;
but
he
was
hanged
*NL*
like
a
dog
,
and
sun-dried
like
the
rest
,
at
Corso
Castle
.
That
*NL*
was
Roberts

men
,
that
was
,
and
comed
of
changing
names
to
their
*NL*
ships
--
ROYAL
FORTUNE
and
so
on
.
Now
,
what
a
ship
was
christened
,
so
let
*NL*
her
stay
,
I
says
.
So
it
was
with
the
CASSANDRA
,
as
brought
us
all
safe
*NL*
home
from
Malabar
,
after
England
took
the
viceroy
of
the
Indies
;
so
it
*NL*
was
with
the
old
WALRUS
,
Flint
's
old
ship
,
as
I
've
seen
amuck
with
the
*NL*
red
blood
and
fit
to
sink
with
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
cried
another
voice
,
that
of
the
youngest
hand
on
board
,
and
*NL*
evidently
full
of
admiration
.
``
He
was
the
flower
of
the
flock
,
was
*NL*
Flint
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Davis
was
a
man
too
,
by
all
accounts
,
''
said
Silver
.
``
I
never
sailed
*NL*
along
of
him
;
first
with
England
,
then
with
Flint

that
's
my
story
;
*NL*
and
now
here
on
my
own
account
,
in
a
manner
of
speaking

I
laid
by
nine
*NL*
hundred
safe

from
England

and
two
thousand
after

That

it

Where

I

Flint
's

Why

most
on

aboard
here

and
glad
to
get

the

been
begging

Where
is

now

Well

he
's
dead
now

and
under
hatches
;
but
for
two
year
before
that
,
shiver
my
timbers
,
*NL*
the
man
was
starving
!
He
begged
,

he
stole
,
and
he
cut
throats
,

*NL*
starved
at
that
,
by
the
powers
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

the
young
seaman

Silver

talk

*NL*
*NL*
You
may
imagine
how
I
felt
when
I
heard
this
abominable
old
rogue
*NL*
addressing
another
in
the
very
same
words
of
flattery
as
he
had
used
*NL*
to
myself
.
I
think
,
if
I
had
been
able
,
that
I
would
have
killed
*NL*
him
through
the
barrel
.
Meantime
,
he
ran
on
,
little
supposing
he
was
*NL*
overheard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
about
gentlemen
of
fortune
.
They
lives
rough
,
and
they
risk
*NL*
swinging
,
but
they
eat
and
drink
like
fighting-cocks
,
and
when
a
cruise
*NL*
is
done
,
why
,
it
's
hundreds
of
pounds
instead
of
hundreds
of
farthings
*NL*
in
their
pockets
.
Now
,
the
most
goes
for
rum
and
a
good
fling
,
and
to
*NL*
sea
again
in
their
shirts
.
But
that
's
not
the
course
I
lay
.
I
puts
it
*NL*
all
away
,
some
here
,
some
there
,
and
none
too
much
anywheres
,
by
reason
*NL*
of
suspicion
.
I
'm
fifty
,
mark
you
;
once
back
from
this
cruise
,
I
set
up
*NL*
gentleman
in
earnest
.
Time
enough
too
,
says
you
.
Ah
,
but
I
've
lived
easy
*NL*
in
the
meantime
,
never
denied
myself
o
'
nothing
heart
desires
,
and
slep
'
*NL*
soft
and
ate
dainty
all
my
days
but
when
at
sea
.
And
how
did
I
begin
?
*NL*
Before
the
mast
,
like
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
other
,
``
but
all
the
other
money
's
gone
now
,
ai
n't
it
?
*NL*
You
dare
n't
show
face
in
Bristol
after
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
where
might
you
suppose
it
was
?
''
asked
Silver
derisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Bristol
,
in
banks
and
places
,
''
answered
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
were
,
''
said
the
cook
;
``
it
were
when
we
weighed
anchor
.
But
my
old
*NL*
missis
has
it
all
by
now
.
And
the
Spy-glass
is
sold
,
lease
and
goodwill
*NL*
and
rigging
;
and
the
old
girl
's
off
to
meet
me
.
I
would
tell
you
where
,
*NL*
for
I
trust
you
,
but
it
'd
make
jealousy
among
the
mates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
can
you
trust
your
missis
?
''
asked
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
fortune
,
''
returned
the
cook
,
``
usually
trusts
little
among
*NL*
themselves
,
and
right
they
are
,
you
may
lay
to
it
.
But
I
have
a
way
with
*NL*
me
,
I
have
.
When
a
mate
brings
a
slip
on
his
cable
--
one
as
knows
me
,
I
*NL*
mean
--
it
wo
n't
be
in
the
same
world
with
old
John
.
There
was
some
that
*NL*
was
feared
of
Pew
,
and
some
that
was
feared
of
Flint
;
but
Flint
his
own
*NL*
self
was
feared
of
me
.
Feared
he
was
,
and
proud
.
They
was
the
roughest
*NL*
crew
afloat
,
was
Flint
's
;
the
devil
himself
would
have
been
feared
to
go
*NL*
to
sea
with
them
.
Well
now
,
I
tell
you
,
I
'm
not
a
boasting
man
,
and
you
*NL*
seen
yourself
how
easy
I
keep
company
,
but
when
I
was
quartermaster
,
*NL*
LAMBS
was
n't
the
word
for
Flint
's
old
buccaneers
.
Ah
,
you
may
be
sure
of
*NL*
yourself
in
old
John
's
ship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
tell
you
now
,
''
replied
the
lad
,
``
I
did
n't
half
a
quarter
like
*NL*
the
job
till
I
had
this
talk
with
you

there
's
my
hand
on
it
*NL*
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
brave
lad
you
were

smart
too

answered
Silver
,
shaking
*NL*
hands
so
heartily
that
all
the
barrel
shook
,
``
and
a
finer
figurehead
for
*NL*
a
gentleman
of
fortune
I
never
clapped
my
eyes
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
I
had
begun
to
understand
the
meaning
of
their
terms
.
By
a
*NL*
``
gentleman
of
fortune
''
they
plainly
meant
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
*NL*
common
pirate
,
and
the
little
scene
that
I
had
overheard
was
the
last
*NL*
act
in
the
corruption
of
one
of
the
honest
hands
--
perhaps
of
the
last
*NL*
one
left
aboard
.
But
on
this
point
I
was
soon
to
be
relieved
,
for
Silver
*NL*
giving
a
little
whistle
,
a
third
man
strolled
up
and
sat
down
by
the
*NL*
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dick

square

said
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
know

Dick

returned
the
voice
of
the
coxswain

*NL*
Israel
Hands
.
``
He
's
no
fool
,
is
Dick

''
And
he
turned
his
quid
and
spat
.
*NL*
``
But
look
here
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
here
's
what
I
want
to
know

I

my

misgave

I
heard

begin
to
rise

then
someone
seemingly
stopped
him

*NL*
the
voice

exclaimed

up

*NL*
*NL*
Terrified
as
I
was
,
I
could
not
help
thinking
to
myself
that
this
must
*NL*
have
been
how
Mr.
Arrow
got
the
strong
waters
that
destroyed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dick
was
gone
but
a
little
while
,
and
during
his
absence
Israel
spoke
*NL*
straight
on
in
the
cook
's
ear
.
It
was
but
a
word
or
two
that
I
could
*NL*
catch
,
and
yet
I
gathered
some
important
news
,
for
besides
other
scraps
*NL*
that
tended
to
the
same
purpose
,
this
whole
clause
was
audible
:
``
Not
*NL*
another
man
of
them
'll
jine

''
Hence
there
were
still
faithful
men
on
*NL*
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dick
returned
,
one
after
another
of
the
trio
took
the
pannikin
and
*NL*
drank
--
one
``
To
luck
,
''
another
with
a
``
Here
's
to
old
Flint
,
''
and
Silver
*NL*
himself
saying
,
in
a
kind
of
song
,
``
Here
's
to
ourselves
,
and
hold
your
*NL*
luff
,
plenty
of
prizes
and
plenty
of
duff

''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
a
sort
of
brightness
fell
upon
me
in
the
barrel
,
and
looking
*NL*
up
,
I
found
the
moon
had
risen
and
was
silvering
the
mizzen-top
and
*NL*
shining
white
on
the
luff
of
the
fore-sail
;
and
almost
at
the
same
time
*NL*
the
voice
of
the
lookout
shouted
,
``
Land
ho
!

*NL*
*NL*
Council
of
War
*NL*
*NL*
THERE
was
a
great
rush
of
feet
across
the
deck
.
I
could
hear
people
*NL*
tumbling
up
from
the
cabin
and
the
forecastle
,
and
slipping
in
an
*NL*
instant
outside
my
barrel
,
I
dived
behind
the
fore-sail
,
made
a
double
*NL*
towards
the
stern
,
and
came
out
upon
the
open
deck
in
time
to
join
*NL*
Hunter
and
Dr.
Livesey
in
the
rush
for
the
weather
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
all
hands
were
already
congregated
.
A
belt
of
fog
had
lifted
*NL*
almost
simultaneously
with
the
appearance
of
the
moon
.
Away
to
the
*NL*
south-west
of
us
we
saw
two
low
hills
,
about
a
couple
of
miles
apart
,
*NL*
and
rising
behind
one
of
them
a
third
and
higher
hill
,
whose
peak
was
*NL*
still
buried
in
the
fog
.
All
three
seemed
sharp
and
conical
in
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
I
saw
,
almost
in
a
dream
,
for
I
had
not
yet
recovered
from
my
*NL*
horrid
fear
of
a
minute
or
two
before
.
And
then
I
heard
the
voice
of
*NL*
Captain
Smollett
issuing
orders
.
The
HISPANIOLA
was
laid
a
couple
of
*NL*
points
nearer
the
wind
and
now
sailed
a
course
that
would
just
clear
the
*NL*
island
on
the
east
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
men
,
''
said
the
captain
,
when
all
was
sheeted
home
,
``
has
any
*NL*
one
of
you
ever
seen
that
land
ahead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
,
sir
,
''
said
Silver
.
``
I
've
watered
there
with
a
trader
I
was
cook
*NL*
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
anchorage
is
on
the
south
,
behind
an
islet
,
I
fancy
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
Skeleton
Island
they
calls
it
.
It
were
a
main
place
for
*NL*
pirates
once
,
and
a
hand
we
had
on
board
knowed
all
their
names
for
it
.
*NL*
That
hill
to
the
nor
`
ard
they
calls
the
Fore-mast
Hill
;
there
are
three
*NL*
hills
in
a
row
running
south
`
ard
--
fore
,
main
,
and
mizzen
,
sir
.
But
the
*NL*
main
--
that
's
the
big
un
,
with
the
cloud
on
it
--
they
usually
calls
*NL*
the
Spy-glass
,
by
reason
of
a
lookout
they
kept
when
they
was
in
the
*NL*
anchorage
cleaning
,
for
it
's
there
they
cleaned
their
ships
,
sir
,
asking
*NL*
your
pardon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
chart
here
,
''
says
Captain
Smollett
.
``
See
if
that
's
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Long
John
's
eyes
burned
in
his
head
as
he
took
the
chart
,
but
by
the
*NL*
fresh
look
of
the
paper
I
knew
he
was
doomed
to
disappointment
.
This
*NL*
was
not
the
map
we
found
in
Billy
Bones
's
chest
,
but
an
accurate
copy
,
*NL*
complete
in
all
things
--
names
and
heights
and
soundings
--
with
the
single
*NL*
exception
of
the
red
crosses
and
the
written
notes
.
Sharp
as
must
have
*NL*
been
his
annoyance
,
Silver
had
the
strength
of
mind
to
hide
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
this
is
the
spot
,
to
be
sure
,
and
very
prettily
*NL*
drawed
out
.
Who
might
have
done
that
,
I
wonder
?
The
pirates
were
too
*NL*
ignorant
,
I
reckon
.
Aye
,
here
it
is
:
`
Capt.
Kidd
's
Anchorage
'
--
just
*NL*
the
name
my
shipmate
called
it
.
There
's
a
strong
current
runs
along
the
*NL*
south
,
and
then
away
nor
`
ard
up
the
west
coast
.
Right
you
was
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
says
he
,
``
to
haul
your
wind
and
keep
the
weather
of
the
island
.
*NL*
Leastways
,
if
such
was
your
intention
as
to
enter
and
careen
,
and
there
*NL*
ai
n't
no
better
place
for
that
in
these
waters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
my
man
,
''
says
Captain
Smollett
.
``
I
'll
ask
you
later
on
to
*NL*
give
us
a
help
.
You
may
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
surprised
at
the
coolness
with
which
John
avowed
his
knowledge
*NL*
of
the
island
,
and
I
own
I
was
half-frightened
when
I
saw
him
drawing
*NL*
nearer
to
myself
.
He
did
not
know
,
to
be
sure
,
that
I
had
overheard
his
*NL*
council
from
the
apple
barrel
,
and
yet
I
had
by
this
time
taken
such
a
*NL*
horror
of
his
cruelty
,
duplicity
,
and
power
that
I
could
scarce
conceal
*NL*
a
shudder
when
he
laid
his
hand
upon
my
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
says
he
,
``
this
here
is
a
sweet
spot
,
this
island
--
a
sweet
spot
for
*NL*
a
lad
to
get
ashore
on
.
You
'll
bathe
,
and
you
'll
climb
trees
,
and
you
'll
*NL*
hunt
goats
,
you
will
;
and
you
'll
get
aloft
on
them
hills
like
a
goat
*NL*
yourself
.
Why
,
it
makes
me
young
again
.
I
was
going
to
forget
my
timber
*NL*
leg
,
I
was
.
It
's
a
pleasant
thing
to
be
young
and
have
ten
toes
,
and
you
*NL*
may
lay
to
that
.
When
you
want
to
go
a
bit
of
exploring
,
you
just
ask
*NL*
old
John
,
and
he
'll
put
up
a
snack
for
you
to
take
along
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
clapping
me
in
the
friendliest
way
upon
the
shoulder
,
he
hobbled
off
*NL*
forward
and
went
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Smollett
,
the
squire
,
and
Dr.
Livesey
were
talking
together
on
*NL*
the
quarter-deck
,
and
anxious
as
I
was
to
tell
them
my
story
,
I
durst
*NL*
not
interrupt
them
openly
.
While
I
was
still
casting
about
in
my
*NL*
thoughts
to
find
some
probable
excuse
,
Dr.
Livesey
called
me
to
his
*NL*
side
.
He
had
left
his
pipe
below
,
and
being
a
slave
to
tobacco
,
had
*NL*
meant
that
I
should
fetch
it
;
but
as
soon
as
I
was
near
enough
to
speak
*NL*
and
not
to
be
overheard
,
I
broke
immediately
,
``
Doctor
,
let
me
speak
.
Get
*NL*
the
captain
and
squire
down
to
the
cabin
,
and
then
make
some
pretence
to
*NL*
send
for
me
.
I
have
terrible
news
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
changed
countenance
a
little
,
but
next
moment
he
was
master
*NL*
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Jim
,
''
said
he
quite
loudly
,
``
that
was
all
I
wanted
to
know
,
''
*NL*
as
if
he
had
asked
me
a
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
he
turned
on
his
heel
and
rejoined
the
other
two
.
They
*NL*
spoke
together
for
a
little
,
and
though
none
of
them
started
,
or
raised
*NL*
his
voice
,
or
so
much
as
whistled
,
it
was
plain
enough
that
Dr.
Livesey
*NL*
had
communicated
my
request
,
for
the
next
thing
that
I
heard
was
the
*NL*
captain
giving
an
order
to
Job
Anderson
,
and
all
hands
were
piped
on
*NL*
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lads
,
''
said
Captain
Smollett
,
``
I
've
a
word
to
say
to
you
.
This
*NL*
land
that
we
have
sighted
is
the
place
we
have
been
sailing
for
.
Mr.
*NL*
Trelawney
,
being
a
very
open-handed
gentleman
,
as
we
all
know
,
has
just
*NL*
asked
me
a
word
or
two
,
and
as
I
was
able
to
tell
him
that
every
man
on
*NL*
board
had
done
his
duty
,
alow
and
aloft
,
as
I
never
ask
to
see
it
done
*NL*
better
,
why
,
he
and
I
and
the
doctor
are
going
below
to
the
cabin
to
*NL*
drink
YOUR
health
and
luck
,
and
you
'll
have
grog
served
out
for
you
to
*NL*
drink
OUR
health
and
luck
.
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
think
of
this
:
I
think
*NL*
it
handsome
.
And
if
you
think
as
I
do
,
you
'll
give
a
good
sea-cheer
for
*NL*
the
gentleman
that
does
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cheer
followed
--
that
was
a
matter
of
course
;
but
it
rang
out
so
full
*NL*
and
hearty
that
I
confess
I
could
hardly
believe
these
same
men
were
*NL*
plotting
for
our
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
more
cheer
for
Cap'n
Smollett
,
''
cried
Long
John
when
the
first
had
*NL*
subsided
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
also
was
given
with
a
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
top
of
that
the
three
gentlemen
went
below
,
and
not
long
after
,
*NL*
word
was
sent
forward
that
Jim
Hawkins
was
wanted
in
the
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
them
all
three
seated
round
the
table
,
a
bottle
of
Spanish
wine
*NL*
and
some
raisins
before
them
,
and
the
doctor
smoking
away
,
with
his
wig
*NL*
on
his
lap
,
and
that
,
I
knew
,
was
a
sign
that
he
was
agitated
.
The
stern
*NL*
window
was
open
,
for
it
was
a
warm
night
,
and
you
could
see
the
moon
*NL*
shining
behind
on
the
ship
's
wake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Hawkins
,
''
said
the
squire
,
``
you
have
something
to
say
.
Speak
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
as
I
was
bid
,
and
as
short
as
I
could
make
it
,
told
the
whole
*NL*
details
of
Silver
's
conversation
.
Nobody
interrupted
me
till
I
was
done
,
*NL*
nor
did
any
one
of
the
three
of
them
make
so
much
as
a
movement
,
but
*NL*
they
kept
their
eyes
upon
my
face
from
first
to
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
,
''
said
Dr.
Livesey
,
``
take
a
seat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
made
me
sit
down
at
table
beside
them
,
poured
me
out
a
glass
of
*NL*
wine
,
filled
my
hands
with
raisins
,
and
all
three
,
one
after
the
other
,
*NL*
and
each
with
a
bow
,
drank
my
good
health
,
and
their
service
to
me
,
for
*NL*
my
luck
and
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
captain
,
''
said
the
squire
,
``
you
were
right
,
and
I
was
wrong
.
I
own
*NL*
myself
an
ass
,
and
I
await
your
orders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
an
ass
than
I
,
sir
,
''
returned
the
captain
.
``
I
never
heard
of
a
*NL*
crew
that
meant
to
mutiny
but
what
showed
signs
before
,
for
any
man
that
*NL*
had
an
eye
in
his
head
to
see
the
mischief
and
take
steps
according
.
But
*NL*
this
crew

''
he
added
,
``
beats
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain

''
said
the
doctor
,
``
with
your
permission

that
's
Silver

A
very
*NL*
remarkable
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'd
look
remarkably
well
from
a
yard-arm
,
sir
,
''
returned
the
captain
.
*NL*
``
But
this
is
talk
;
this
do
n't
lead
to
anything
.
I
see
three
or
four
*NL*
points
,
and
with
Mr.
Trelawney
's
permission
,
I
'll
name
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
sir
,
are
the
captain
.
It
is
for
you
to
speak
,
''
says
Mr.
Trelawney
*NL*
grandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
point
,
''
began
Mr.
Smollett
.
``
We
must
go
on
,
because
we
ca
n't
turn
*NL*
back

If
I
gave
the
word
to
go
about
,
they
would
rise
at
once
.
Second
*NL*
point
,
we
have
time
before
us
--
at
least
until
this
treasure
's
found
.
*NL*
Third
point
,
there
are
faithful
hands
.
Now
,
sir
,
it
's
got
to
come
*NL*
to
blows
sooner
or
later
,
and
what
I
propose
is
to
take
time
by
the
*NL*
forelock
,
as
the
saying
is
,
and
come
to
blows
some
fine
day
when
they
*NL*
least
expect
it
.
We
can
count
,
I
take
it
,
on
your
own
home
servants
,
Mr.
*NL*
Trelawney
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
upon
myself

declared
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three

reckoned
the
captain
;
``
ourselves
make
seven
,
counting
Hawkins
*NL*
here

Now
,
about
the
honest
hands
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
likely
Trelawney
's
own
men

''
said
the
doctor
;
``
those
he
had
picked
*NL*
up
for
himself
before
he
lit
on
Silver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay

''
replied
the
squire
.
``
Hands
was
one
of
mine

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
think
I
could
have
trusted
Hands

added
the
captain

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
think
that
they
're
all
Englishmen
!

broke
out
the
squire
.
``
Sir
,
*NL*
I
could
find
it
in
my
heart
to
blow
the
ship
up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
gentlemen
,

said
the
captain
,
``
the
best
that
I
can
say
is
not
*NL*
much

We
must
lay
to

keep
a
bright
lookout
.
It
's
*NL*
trying
on
a
man
,
I
know
.
It
would
be
pleasanter
to
come
to
blows
.
But
*NL*
there
's
no
help
for
it
till
we
know
our
men

Lay
to

and
whistle
for
a
*NL*
wind

that
's
my
view

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
here

said
the
doctor

``
can
help
us
more
than
anyone

The
men
are
*NL*
not
shy
with
him
,
and
Jim
is
a
noticing
lad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hawkins
,
I
put
prodigious
faith
in
you

''
added
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
feel
pretty
desperate
at
this
,
for
I
felt
altogether
*NL*
helpless
;
and
yet
,
by
an
odd
train
of
circumstances
,
it
was
indeed
*NL*
through
me
that
safety
came
.
In
the
meantime
,
talk
as
we
pleased
,
there
*NL*
were
only
seven
out
of
the
twenty-six
on
whom
we
knew
we
could
rely
;
and
*NL*
out
of
these
seven
one
was
a
boy
,
so
that
the
grown
men
on
our
side
were
*NL*
six
to
their
nineteen

PART

--
My
Shore
Adventure

*NL*
*NL*
How
My
Shore
Adventure
Began
*NL*
*NL*
THE
appearance
of
the
island
when
I
came
on
deck
next
morning
was
*NL*
altogether
changed
.
Although
the
breeze
had
now
utterly
ceased
,
we
had
*NL*
made
a
great
deal
of
way
during
the
night
and
were
now
lying
becalmed
*NL*
about
half
a
mile
to
the
south-east
of
the
low
eastern
coast
.
*NL*
Grey-coloured
woods
covered
a
large
part
of
the
surface
.
This
even
tint
*NL*
was
indeed
broken
up
by
streaks
of
yellow
sand-break
in
the
lower
lands
,
*NL*
and
by
many
tall
trees
of
the
pine
family
,
out-topping
the
others
--
some
*NL*
singly
,
some
in
clumps
;
but
the
general
colouring
was
uniform
and
sad
.
*NL*
The
hills
ran
up
clear
above
the
vegetation
in
spires
of
naked
rock
.
*NL*
All
were
strangely
shaped
,
and
the
Spy-glass
,
which
was
by
three
or
four
*NL*
hundred
feet
the
tallest
on
the
island
,
was
likewise
the
strangest
in
*NL*
configuration
,
running
up
sheer
from
almost
every
side
and
then
suddenly
*NL*
cut
off
at
the
top
like
a
pedestal
to
put
a
statue
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
HISPANIOLA
was
rolling
scuppers
under
in
the
ocean
swell
.
The
booms
*NL*
were
tearing
at
the
blocks
,
the
rudder
was
banging
to
and
fro
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
ship
creaking
,
groaning
,
and
jumping
like
a
manufactory
.
I
had
*NL*
to
cling
tight
to
the
backstay
,
and
the
world
turned
giddily
before
my
*NL*
eyes
,
for
though
I
was
a
good
enough
sailor
when
there
was
way
on
,
this
*NL*
standing
still
and
being
rolled
about
like
a
bottle
was
a
thing
I
never
*NL*
learned
to
stand
without
a
qualm
or
so
,
above
all
in
the
morning
,
on
an
*NL*
empty
stomach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
this
--
perhaps
it
was
the
look
of
the
island
,
with
its
*NL*
grey
,
melancholy
woods
,
and
wild
stone
spires
,
and
the
surf
that
we
*NL*
could
both
see
and
hear
foaming
and
thundering
on
the
steep
beach
--
at
*NL*
least
,
although
the
sun
shone
bright
and
hot
,
and
the
shore
birds
were
*NL*
fishing
and
crying
all
around
us
,
and
you
would
have
thought
anyone
*NL*
would
have
been
glad
to
get
to
land
after
being
so
long
at
sea
,
my
heart
*NL*
sank
,
as
the
saying
is
,
into
my
boots
;
and
from
the
first
look
onward
,
I
*NL*
hated
the
very
thought
of
Treasure
Island
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
dreary
morning
's
work
before
us
,
for
there
was
no
sign
of
any
*NL*
wind
,
and
the
boats
had
to
be
got
out
and
manned
,
and
the
ship
warped
*NL*
three
or
four
miles
round
the
corner
of
the
island
and
up
the
narrow
*NL*
passage
to
the
haven
behind
Skeleton
Island
.
I
volunteered
for
one
of
*NL*
the
boats
,
where
I
had
,
of
course
,
no
business
.
The
heat
was
sweltering
,
*NL*
and
the
men
grumbled
fiercely
over
their
work
.
Anderson
was
in
command
*NL*
of
my
boat
,
and
instead
of
keeping
the
crew
in
order
,
he
grumbled
as
*NL*
loud
as
the
worst
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
with
an
oath
,
``
it
's
not
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
this
was
a
very
bad
sign
,
for
up
to
that
day
the
men
had
gone
*NL*
briskly
and
willingly
about
their
business
;
but
the
very
sight
of
the
*NL*
island
had
relaxed
the
cords
of
discipline
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
way
in
,
Long
John
stood
by
the
steersman
and
conned
the
ship
.
*NL*
He
knew
the
passage
like
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
and
though
the
man
in
the
*NL*
chains
got
everywhere
more
water
than
was
down
in
the
chart
,
John
never
*NL*
hesitated
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
strong
scour
with
the
ebb
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
this
here
passage
*NL*
has
been
dug
out
,
in
a
manner
of
speaking
,
with
a
spade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
brought
up
just
where
the
anchor
was
in
the
chart
,
about
a
third
of
*NL*
a
mile
from
each
shore
,
the
mainland
on
one
side
and
Skeleton
Island
on
*NL*
the
other
.
The
bottom
was
clean
sand
.
The
plunge
of
our
anchor
sent
up
*NL*
clouds
of
birds
wheeling
and
crying
over
the
woods
,
but
in
less
than
a
*NL*
minute
they
were
down
again
and
all
was
once
more
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
was
entirely
land-locked
,
buried
in
woods
,
the
trees
coming
*NL*
right
down
to
high-water
mark
,
the
shores
mostly
flat
,
and
the
hilltops
*NL*
standing
round
at
a
distance
in
a
sort
of
amphitheatre
,
one
here
,
one
*NL*
there
.
Two
little
rivers
,
or
rather
two
swamps
,
emptied
out
into
this
*NL*
pond
,
as
you
might
call
it
;
and
the
foliage
round
that
part
of
the
shore
*NL*
had
a
kind
of
poisonous
brightness
.
From
the
ship
we
could
see
nothing
*NL*
of
the
house
or
stockade
,
for
they
were
quite
buried
among
trees
;
and
if
*NL*
it
had
not
been
for
the
chart
on
the
companion
,
we
might
have
been
the
*NL*
first
that
had
ever
anchored
there
since
the
island
arose
out
of
the
*NL*
seas
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
not
a
breath
of
air
moving
,
nor
a
sound
but
that
of
the
*NL*
surf
booming
half
a
mile
away
along
the
beaches
and
against
the
rocks
*NL*
outside
.
A
peculiar
stagnant
smell
hung
over
the
anchorage
--
a
smell
of
*NL*
sodden
leaves
and
rotting
tree
trunks
.
I
observed
the
doctor
sniffing
*NL*
and
sniffing
,
like
someone
tasting
a
bad
egg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
about
treasure
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
I
'll
stake
my
wig
there
's
*NL*
fever
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
conduct
of
the
men
had
been
alarming
in
the
boat
,
it
became
truly
*NL*
threatening
when
they
had
come
aboard
.
They
lay
about
the
deck
growling
*NL*
together
in
talk
.
The
slightest
order
was
received
with
a
black
look
and
*NL*
grudgingly
and
carelessly
obeyed
.
Even
the
honest
hands
must
have
caught
*NL*
the
infection
,
for
there
was
not
one
man
aboard
to
mend
another
.
Mutiny
,
*NL*
it
was
plain
,
hung
over
us
like
a
thunder-cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
not
only
we
of
the
cabin
party
who
perceived
the
danger
.
Long
*NL*
John
was
hard
at
work
going
from
group
to
group
,
spending
himself
in
*NL*
good
advice
,
and
as
for
example
no
man
could
have
shown
a
better
.
He
*NL*
fairly
outstripped
himself
in
willingness
and
civility
;
he
was
all
*NL*
smiles
to
everyone
.
If
an
order
were
given
,
John
would
be
on
his
crutch
*NL*
in
an
instant
,
with
the
cheeriest
``
Aye
,
aye
,
sir
!
''
in
the
world
;
and
*NL*
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
,
he
kept
up
one
song
after
another
,
as
*NL*
if
to
conceal
the
discontent
of
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
the
gloomy
features
of
that
gloomy
afternoon
,
this
obvious
*NL*
anxiety
on
the
part
of
Long
John
appeared
the
worst
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
held
a
council
in
the
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
if
I
risk
another
order
,
the
whole
ship
'll
*NL*
come
about
our
ears
by
the
run
.
You
see
,
sir
,
here
it
is
.
I
get
a
rough
*NL*
answer
,
do
I
not
?
Well
,
if
I
speak
back
,
pikes
will
be
going
in
two
*NL*
shakes
;
if
I
do
n't
,
Silver
will
see
there
's
something
under
that
,
and
*NL*
the
game
's
up
.
Now
,
we
've
only
one
man
to
rely
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
that
?
''
asked
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silver
,
sir
,
''
returned
the
captain
;
``
he
's
as
anxious
as
you
and
I
to
*NL*
smother
things
up
.
This
is
a
tiff
;
he
'd
soon
talk
'em
out
of
it
if
he
*NL*
had
the
chance
,
and
what
I
propose
to
do
is
to
give
him
the
chance
.
*NL*
Let
's
allow
the
men
an
afternoon
ashore
.
If
they
all
go
,
why
we
'll
fight
*NL*
the
ship
.
If
they
none
of
them
go
,
well
then
,
we
hold
the
cabin
,
and
God
*NL*
defend
the
right
.
If
some
go
,
you
mark
my
words
,
sir
,
Silver
'll
bring
*NL*
'em
aboard
again
as
mild
as
lambs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
decided
;
loaded
pistols
were
served
out
to
all
the
sure
men
;
*NL*
Hunter
,
Joyce
,
and
Redruth
were
taken
into
our
confidence
and
received
*NL*
the
news
with
less
surprise
and
a
better
spirit
than
we
had
looked
for
,
*NL*
and
then
the
captain
went
on
deck
and
addressed
the
crew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lads
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
've
had
a
hot
day
and
are
all
tired
and
out
of
*NL*
sorts
.
A
turn
ashore
'll
hurt
nobody
--
the
boats
are
still
in
the
water
;
*NL*
you
can
take
the
gigs
,
and
as
many
as
please
may
go
ashore
for
the
*NL*
afternoon
.
I
'll
fire
a
gun
half
an
hour
before
sundown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
the
silly
fellows
must
have
thought
they
would
break
their
*NL*
shins
over
treasure
as
soon
as
they
were
landed
,
for
they
all
came
out
*NL*
of
their
sulks
in
a
moment
and
gave
a
cheer
that
started
the
echo
in
a
*NL*
faraway
hill
and
sent
the
birds
once
more
flying
and
squalling
round
the
*NL*
anchorage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
too
bright
to
be
in
the
way
.
He
whipped
out
of
sight
*NL*
in
a
moment
,
leaving
Silver
to
arrange
the
party
,
and
I
fancy
it
was
as
*NL*
well
he
did
so
.
Had
he
been
on
deck
,
he
could
no
longer
so
much
as
*NL*
have
pretended
not
to
understand
the
situation
.
It
was
as
plain
as
day
.
*NL*
Silver
was
the
captain
,
and
a
mighty
rebellious
crew
he
had
of
it
.
The
*NL*
honest
hands
--
and
I
was
soon
to
see
it
proved
that
there
were
such
on
*NL*
board
--
must
have
been
very
stupid
fellows
.
Or
rather
,
I
suppose
the
*NL*
truth
was
this
,
that
all
hands
were
disaffected
by
the
example
of
the
*NL*
ringleaders
--
only
some
more
,
some
less
;
and
a
few
,
being
good
fellows
in
*NL*
the
main
,
could
neither
be
led
nor
driven
any
further
.
It
is
one
thing
*NL*
to
be
idle
and
skulk
and
quite
another
to
take
a
ship
and
murder
a
*NL*
number
of
innocent
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
however
,
the
party
was
made
up
.
Six
fellows
were
to
stay
on
*NL*
board
,
and
the
remaining
thirteen
,
including
Silver
,
began
to
embark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
that
there
came
into
my
head
the
first
of
the
mad
notions
*NL*
that
contributed
so
much
to
save
our
lives
.
If
six
men
were
left
by
*NL*
Silver
,
it
was
plain
our
party
could
not
take
and
fight
the
ship
;
and
*NL*
since
only
six
were
left
,
it
was
equally
plain
that
the
cabin
party
*NL*
had
no
present
need
of
my
assistance
.
It
occurred
to
me
at
once
to
go
*NL*
ashore
.
In
a
jiffy
I
had
slipped
over
the
side
and
curled
up
in
the
*NL*
fore-sheets
of
the
nearest
boat
,
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
she
*NL*
shoved
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
took
notice
of
me
,
only
the
bow
oar
saying
,
``
Is
that
you
,
Jim
?
*NL*
Keep
your
head
down
.
''
But
Silver
,
from
the
other
boat
,
looked
sharply
*NL*
over
and
called
out
to
know
if
that
were
me
;
and
from
that
moment
I
*NL*
began
to
regret
what
I
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crews
raced
for
the
beach
,
but
the
boat
I
was
in
,
having
some
start
*NL*
and
being
at
once
the
lighter
and
the
better
manned
,
shot
far
ahead
of
*NL*
her
consort
,
and
the
bow
had
struck
among
the
shore-side
trees
and
I
*NL*
had
caught
a
branch
and
swung
myself
out
and
plunged
into
the
nearest
*NL*
thicket
while
Silver
and
the
rest
were
still
a
hundred
yards
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
,
Jim
!
''
I
heard
him
shouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
you
may
suppose
I
paid
no
heed
;
jumping
,
ducking
,
and
breaking
*NL*
through
,
I
ran
straight
before
my
nose
till
I
could
run
no
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
First
Blow
*NL*
*NL*
I
WAS
so
pleased
at
having
given
the
slip
to
Long
John
that
I
began
to
*NL*
enjoy
myself
and
look
around
me
with
some
interest
on
the
strange
land
*NL*
that
I
was
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
crossed
a
marshy
tract
full
of
willows
,
bulrushes
,
and
odd
,
*NL*
outlandish
,
swampy
trees
;
and
I
had
now
come
out
upon
the
skirts
of
an
*NL*
open
piece
of
undulating
,
sandy
country
,
about
a
mile
long
,
dotted
with
*NL*
a
few
pines
and
a
great
number
of
contorted
trees
,
not
unlike
the
oak
*NL*
in
growth
,
but
pale
in
the
foliage
,
like
willows
.
On
the
far
side
of
*NL*
the
open
stood
one
of
the
hills
,
with
two
quaint
,
craggy
peaks
shining
*NL*
vividly
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
felt
for
the
first
time
the
joy
of
exploration
.
The
isle
was
*NL*
uninhabited
;
my
shipmates
I
had
left
behind
,
and
nothing
lived
in
front
*NL*
of
me
but
dumb
brutes
and
fowls
.
I
turned
hither
and
thither
among
the
*NL*
trees
.
Here
and
there
were
flowering
plants
,
unknown
to
me
;
here
and
*NL*
there
I
saw
snakes
,
and
one
raised
his
head
from
a
ledge
of
rock
and
*NL*
hissed
at
me
with
a
noise
not
unlike
the
spinning
of
a
top
.
Little
did
*NL*
I
suppose
that
he
was
a
deadly
enemy
and
that
the
noise
was
the
famous
*NL*
rattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
came
to
a
long
thicket
of
these
oaklike
trees
--
live
,
or
*NL*
evergreen
,
oaks
,
I
heard
afterwards
they
should
be
called
--
which
grew
*NL*
low
along
the
sand
like
brambles
,
the
boughs
curiously
twisted
,
the
*NL*
foliage
compact
,
like
thatch
.
The
thicket
stretched
down
from
the
top
of
*NL*
one
of
the
sandy
knolls
,
spreading
and
growing
taller
as
it
went
,
until
*NL*
it
reached
the
margin
of
the
broad
,
reedy
fen
,
through
which
the
nearest
*NL*
of
the
little
rivers
soaked
its
way
into
the
anchorage
.
The
marsh
was
*NL*
steaming
in
the
strong
sun
,
and
the
outline
of
the
Spy-glass
trembled
*NL*
through
the
haze
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
there
began
to
go
a
sort
of
bustle
among
the
bulrushes
;
*NL*
a
wild
duck
flew
up
with
a
quack
,
another
followed
,
and
soon
over
the
*NL*
whole
surface
of
the
marsh
a
great
cloud
of
birds
hung
screaming
and
*NL*
circling
in
the
air
.
I
judged
at
once
that
some
of
my
shipmates
must
be
*NL*
drawing
near
along
the
borders
of
the
fen
.
Nor
was
I
deceived
,
for
soon
*NL*
I
heard
the
very
distant
and
low
tones
of
a
human
voice
,
which
,
as
I
*NL*
continued
to
give
ear
,
grew
steadily
louder
and
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
put
me
in
a
great
fear
,
and
I
crawled
under
cover
of
the
nearest
*NL*
live-oak
and
squatted
there
,
hearkening
,
as
silent
as
a
mouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
voice
answered
,
and
then
the
first
voice
,
which
I
now
recognized
*NL*
to
be
Silver
's
,
once
more
took
up
the
story
and
ran
on
for
a
long
while
*NL*
in
a
stream
,
only
now
and
again
interrupted
by
the
other
.
By
the
sound
*NL*
they
must
have
been
talking
earnestly
,
and
almost
fiercely
;
but
no
*NL*
distinct
word
came
to
my
hearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
speakers
seemed
to
have
paused
and
perhaps
to
have
sat
down
,
*NL*
for
not
only
did
they
cease
to
draw
any
nearer
,
but
the
birds
themselves
*NL*
began
to
grow
more
quiet
and
to
settle
again
to
their
places
in
the
*NL*
swamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
I
began
to
feel
that
I
was
neglecting
my
business
,
that
since
*NL*
I
had
been
so
foolhardy
as
to
come
ashore
with
these
desperadoes
,
the
*NL*
least
I
could
do
was
to
overhear
them
at
their
councils
,
and
that
my
*NL*
plain
and
obvious
duty
was
to
draw
as
close
as
I
could
manage
,
under
the
*NL*
favourable
ambush
of
the
crouching
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
tell
the
direction
of
the
speakers
pretty
exactly
,
not
only
by
*NL*
the
sound
of
their
voices
but
by
the
behaviour
of
the
few
birds
that
*NL*
still
hung
in
alarm
above
the
heads
of
the
intruders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crawling
on
all
fours
,
I
made
steadily
but
slowly
towards
them
,
till
at
*NL*
last
,
raising
my
head
to
an
aperture
among
the
leaves
,
I
could
see
clear
*NL*
down
into
a
little
green
dell
beside
the
marsh
,
and
closely
set
about
*NL*
with
trees
,
where
Long
John
Silver
and
another
of
the
crew
stood
face
to
*NL*
face
in
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
beat
full
upon
them
.
Silver
had
thrown
his
hat
beside
him
on
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
his
great
,
smooth
,
blond
face
,
all
shining
with
heat
,
was
*NL*
lifted
to
the
other
man
's
in
a
kind
of
appeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mate
,
''
he
was
saying
,
``
it
's
because
I
thinks
gold
dust
of
you
--
gold
*NL*
dust
,
and
you
may
lay
to
that
!
If
I
had
n't
took
to
you
like
pitch
,
do
*NL*
you
think
I
'd
have
been
here
a-warning
of
you
?
All
's
up
--
you
ca
n't
make
*NL*
nor
mend
;
it
's
to
save
your
neck
that
I
'm
a-speaking
,
and
if
one
of
the
*NL*
wild
uns
knew
it
,
where
'd
I
be
,
Tom
--
now
,
tell
me
,
where
'd
I
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silver
,
''
said
the
other
man
--
and
I
observed
he
was
not
only
red
in
the
*NL*
face
,
but
spoke
as
hoarse
as
a
crow
,
and
his
voice
shook
too
,
like
a
*NL*
taut
rope
--
``
Silver
,
''
says
he
,
``
you
're
old
,
and
you
're
honest
,
or
has
the
*NL*
name
for
it
;
and
you
've
money
too
,
which
lots
of
poor
sailors
has
n't
;
*NL*
and
you
're
brave
,
or
I
'm
mistook
.
And
will
you
tell
me
you
'll
let
*NL*
yourself
be
led
away
with
that
kind
of
a
mess
of
swabs
?
Not
you
!
As
sure
*NL*
as
God
sees
me
,
I
'd
sooner
lose
my
hand
.
If
I
turn
agin
my
dooty
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
all
of
a
sudden
he
was
interrupted
by
a
noise
.
I
had
found
*NL*
one
of
the
honest
hands
--
well
,
here
,
at
that
same
moment
,
came
news
of
*NL*
another
.
Far
away
out
in
the
marsh
there
arose
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
a
sound
*NL*
like
the
cry
of
anger
,
then
another
on
the
back
of
it
;
and
then
one
*NL*
horrid
,
long-drawn
scream
.
The
rocks
of
the
Spy-glass
re-echoed
it
a
*NL*
score
of
times
;
the
whole
troop
of
marsh-birds
rose
again
,
darkening
*NL*
heaven
,
with
a
simultaneous
whirr
;
and
long
after
that
death
yell
was
*NL*
still
ringing
in
my
brain
,
silence
had
re-established
its
empire
,
and
*NL*
only
the
rustle
of
the
redescending
birds
and
the
boom
of
the
distant
*NL*
surges
disturbed
the
languor
of
the
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
leaped
at
the
sound
,
like
a
horse
at
the
spur
,
but
Silver
had
*NL*
not
winked
an
eye
.
He
stood
where
he
was
,
resting
lightly
on
his
crutch
,
*NL*
watching
his
companion
like
a
snake
about
to
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
John
!
''
said
the
sailor
,
stretching
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hands
off
!
''
cried
Silver
,
leaping
back
a
yard
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
with
*NL*
the
speed
and
security
of
a
trained
gymnast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hands
off
,
if
you
like
,
John
Silver
,
''
said
the
other
.
``
It
's
a
black
*NL*
conscience
that
can
make
you
feared
of
me
.
But
in
heaven
's
name
,
tell
*NL*
me
,
what
was
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
?
''
returned
Silver
,
smiling
away
,
but
warier
than
ever
,
his
eye
*NL*
a
mere
pin-point
in
his
big
face
,
but
gleaming
like
a
crumb
of
glass
.
*NL*
``
That
?
Oh
,
I
reckon
that
'll
be
Alan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
this
point
Tom
flashed
out
like
a
hero
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alan
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Then
rest
his
soul
for
a
true
seaman
!
And
as
for
you
,
*NL*
John
Silver
,
long
you
've
been
a
mate
of
mine
,
but
you
're
mate
of
mine
*NL*
no
more
.
If
I
die
like
a
dog
,
I
'll
die
in
my
dooty
.
You
've
killed
Alan
,
*NL*
have
you
?
Kill
me
too
,
if
you
can
.
But
I
defies
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
,
this
brave
fellow
turned
his
back
directly
on
the
cook
*NL*
and
set
off
walking
for
the
beach
.
But
he
was
not
destined
to
go
far
.
*NL*
With
a
cry
John
seized
the
branch
of
a
tree
,
whipped
the
crutch
out
of
*NL*
his
armpit
,
and
sent
that
uncouth
missile
hurtling
through
the
air
.
*NL*
It
struck
poor
Tom
,
point
foremost
,
and
with
stunning
violence
,
right
*NL*
between
the
shoulders
in
the
middle
of
his
back
.
His
hands
flew
up
,
he
*NL*
gave
a
sort
of
gasp
,
and
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
he
were
injured
much
or
little
,
none
could
ever
tell
.
Like
*NL*
enough
,
to
judge
from
the
sound
,
his
back
was
broken
on
the
spot
.
But
he
*NL*
had
no
time
given
him
to
recover
.
Silver
,
agile
as
a
monkey
even
without
*NL*
leg
or
crutch
,
was
on
the
top
of
him
next
moment
and
had
twice
buried
*NL*
his
knife
up
to
the
hilt
in
that
defenceless
body
.
From
my
place
of
*NL*
ambush
,
I
could
hear
him
pant
aloud
as
he
struck
the
blows
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
what
it
rightly
is
to
faint
,
but
I
do
know
that
for
the
*NL*
next
little
while
the
whole
world
swam
away
from
before
me
in
a
whirling
*NL*
mist
;
Silver
and
the
birds
,
and
the
tall
Spy-glass
hilltop
,
going
*NL*
round
and
round
and
topsy-turvy
before
my
eyes
,
and
all
manner
of
bells
*NL*
ringing
and
distant
voices
shouting
in
my
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
came
again
to
myself
the
monster
had
pulled
himself
together
,
*NL*
his
crutch
under
his
arm
,
his
hat
upon
his
head
.
Just
before
him
Tom
*NL*
lay
motionless
upon
the
sward
;
but
the
murderer
minded
him
not
a
whit
,
*NL*
cleansing
his
blood-stained
knife
the
while
upon
a
wisp
of
grass
.
*NL*
Everything
else
was
unchanged
,
the
sun
still
shining
mercilessly
on
the
*NL*
steaming
marsh
and
the
tall
pinnacle
of
the
mountain
,
and
I
could
scarce
*NL*
persuade
myself
that
murder
had
been
actually
done
and
a
human
life
*NL*
cruelly
cut
short
a
moment
since
before
my
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
John
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
brought
out
a
whistle
,
and
*NL*
blew
upon
it
several
modulated
blasts
that
rang
far
across
the
heated
*NL*
air
.
I
could
not
tell
,
of
course
,
the
meaning
of
the
signal
,
but
*NL*
it
instantly
awoke
my
fears
.
More
men
would
be
coming
.
I
might
be
*NL*
discovered
.
They
had
already
slain
two
of
the
honest
people
;
after
Tom
*NL*
and
Alan
,
might
not
I
come
next
?
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
I
began
to
extricate
myself
and
crawl
back
again
,
with
what
*NL*
speed
and
silence
I
could
manage
,
to
the
more
open
portion
of
the
*NL*
wood
.
As
I
did
so
,
I
could
hear
hails
coming
and
going
between
the
old
*NL*
buccaneer
and
his
comrades
,
and
this
sound
of
danger
lent
me
wings
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
I
was
clear
of
the
thicket
,
I
ran
as
I
never
ran
before
,
scarce
*NL*
minding
the
direction
of
my
flight
,
so
long
as
it
led
me
from
the
*NL*
murderers
;
and
as
I
ran
,
fear
grew
and
grew
upon
me
until
it
turned
into
*NL*
a
kind
of
frenzy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
could
anyone
be
more
entirely
lost
than
I
?
When
the
gun
fired
,
*NL*
how
should
I
dare
to
go
down
to
the
boats
among
those
fiends
,
still
*NL*
smoking
from
their
crime
?
Would
not
the
first
of
them
who
saw
me
wring
*NL*
my
neck
like
a
snipe
's
?
Would
not
my
absence
itself
be
an
evidence
to
*NL*
them
of
my
alarm
,
and
therefore
of
my
fatal
knowledge
?
It
was
all
over
,
*NL*
I
thought
.
Good-bye
to
the
HISPANIOLA
;
good-bye
to
the
squire
,
the
*NL*
doctor
,
and
the
captain
!
There
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
death
by
*NL*
starvation
or
death
by
the
hands
of
the
mutineers
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
,
as
I
say
,
I
was
still
running
,
and
without
taking
any
*NL*
notice
,
I
had
drawn
near
to
the
foot
of
the
little
hill
with
the
two
*NL*
peaks
and
had
got
into
a
part
of
the
island
where
the
live-oaks
grew
*NL*
more
widely
apart
and
seemed
more
like
forest
trees
in
their
bearing
and
*NL*
dimensions
.
Mingled
with
these
were
a
few
scattered
pines
,
some
fifty
,
*NL*
some
nearer
seventy
,
feet
high
.
The
air
too
smelt
more
freshly
than
down
*NL*
beside
the
marsh
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
here
a
fresh
alarm
brought
me
to
a
standstill
with
a
thumping
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
15
*NL*
*NL*
The
Man
of
the
Island
*NL*
*NL*
FROM
the
side
of
the
hill
,
which
was
here
steep
and
stony
,
a
spout
of
*NL*
gravel
was
dislodged
and
fell
rattling
and
bounding
through
the
trees
.
*NL*
My
eyes
turned
instinctively
in
that
direction
,
and
I
saw
a
figure
leap
*NL*
with
great
rapidity
behind
the
trunk
of
a
pine
.
What
it
was
,
whether
*NL*
bear
or
man
or
monkey
,
I
could
in
no
wise
tell
.
It
seemed
dark
and
*NL*
shaggy
;
more
I
knew
not
.
But
the
terror
of
this
new
apparition
brought
*NL*
me
to
a
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
,
it
seemed
,
cut
off
upon
both
sides
;
behind
me
the
murderers
,
*NL*
before
me
this
lurking
nondescript
.
And
immediately
I
began
to
prefer
*NL*
the
dangers
that
I
knew
to
those
I
knew
not
.
Silver
himself
appeared
*NL*
less
terrible
in
contrast
with
this
creature
of
the
woods
,
and
I
turned
*NL*
on
my
heel
,
and
looking
sharply
behind
me
over
my
shoulder
,
began
to
*NL*
retrace
my
steps
in
the
direction
of
the
boats
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
the
figure
reappeared
,
and
making
a
wide
circuit
,
began
to
*NL*
head
me
off
.
I
was
tired
,
at
any
rate
;
but
had
I
been
as
fresh
as
when
I
*NL*
rose
,
I
could
see
it
was
in
vain
for
me
to
contend
in
speed
with
such
an
*NL*
adversary
.
From
trunk
to
trunk
the
creature
flitted
like
a
deer
,
running
*NL*
manlike
on
two
legs
,
but
unlike
any
man
that
I
had
ever
seen
,
stooping
*NL*
almost
double
as
it
ran
.
Yet
a
man
it
was
,
I
could
no
longer
be
in
doubt
*NL*
about
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
recall
what
I
had
heard
of
cannibals
.
I
was
within
an
ace
of
*NL*
calling
for
help
.
But
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
a
man
,
however
wild
,
*NL*
had
somewhat
reassured
me
,
and
my
fear
of
Silver
began
to
revive
in
*NL*
proportion
.
I
stood
still
,
therefore
,
and
cast
about
for
some
method
of
*NL*
escape
;
and
as
I
was
so
thinking
,
the
recollection
of
my
pistol
flashed
*NL*
into
my
mind
.
As
soon
as
I
remembered
I
was
not
defenceless
,
courage
*NL*
glowed
again
in
my
heart
and
I
set
my
face
resolutely
for
this
man
of
*NL*
the
island
and
walked
briskly
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
concealed
by
this
time
behind
another
tree
trunk
;
but
he
must
*NL*
have
been
watching
me
closely
,
for
as
soon
as
I
began
to
move
in
his
*NL*
direction
he
reappeared
and
took
a
step
to
meet
me
.
Then
he
hesitated
,
*NL*
drew
back
,
came
forward
again
,
and
at
last
,
to
my
wonder
and
*NL*
confusion
,
threw
himself
on
his
knees
and
held
out
his
clasped
hands
in
*NL*
supplication
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
I
once
more
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ben
Gunn
,
''
he
answered
,
and
his
voice
sounded
hoarse
and
awkward
,
*NL*
like
a
rusty
lock
.
``
I
'm
poor
Ben
Gunn
,
I
am
;
and
I
have
n't
spoke
with
a
*NL*
Christian
these
three
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
now
see
that
he
was
a
white
man
like
myself
and
that
his
*NL*
features
were
even
pleasing
.
His
skin
,
wherever
it
was
exposed
,
was
*NL*
burnt
by
the
sun
;
even
his
lips
were
black
,
and
his
fair
eyes
looked
*NL*
quite
startling
in
so
dark
a
face
.
Of
all
the
beggar-men
that
I
had
seen
*NL*
or
fancied
,
he
was
the
chief
for
raggedness
.
He
was
clothed
with
tatters
*NL*
of
old
ship
's
canvas
and
old
sea-cloth
,
and
this
extraordinary
patchwork
*NL*
was
all
held
together
by
a
system
of
the
most
various
and
incongruous
*NL*
fastenings
,
brass
buttons
,
bits
of
stick
,
and
loops
of
tarry
gaskin
.
*NL*
About
his
waist
he
wore
an
old
brass-buckled
leather
belt
,
which
was
the
*NL*
one
thing
solid
in
his
whole
accoutrement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
years
!
''
I
cried
.
``
Were
you
shipwrecked
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
mate
,
''
said
he
;
``
marooned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
heard
the
word
,
and
I
knew
it
stood
for
a
horrible
kind
of
*NL*
punishment
common
enough
among
the
buccaneers
,
in
which
the
offender
*NL*
is
put
ashore
with
a
little
powder
and
shot
and
left
behind
on
some
*NL*
desolate
and
distant
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marooned
three
years
agone
,
''
he
continued
,
``
and
lived
on
goats
since
*NL*
then
,
and
berries
,
and
oysters
.
Wherever
a
man
is
,
says
I
,
a
man
can
*NL*
do
for
himself
.
But
,
mate
,
my
heart
is
sore
for
Christian
diet
.
You
*NL*
might
n't
happen
to
have
a
piece
of
cheese
about
you
,
now
?
No
?
Well
,
*NL*
many
's
the
long
night
I
've
dreamed
of
cheese
--
toasted
,
mostly
--
and
woke
*NL*
up
again
,
and
here
I
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
ever
I
can
get
aboard
again
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
shall
have
cheese
by
the
*NL*
stone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
he
had
been
feeling
the
stuff
of
my
jacket
,
smoothing
*NL*
my
hands
,
looking
at
my
boots
,
and
generally
,
in
the
intervals
of
*NL*
his
speech
,
showing
a
childish
pleasure
in
the
presence
of
a
fellow
*NL*
creature
.
But
at
my
last
words
he
perked
up
into
a
kind
of
startled
*NL*
slyness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
ever
you
can
get
aboard
again
,
says
you
?
''
he
repeated
.
``
Why
,
now
,
*NL*
who
's
to
hinder
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
you
,
I
know
,
''
was
my
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
right
you
was
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Now
you
--
what
do
you
call
yourself
,
*NL*
mate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
,
''
I
told
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
,
Jim
,
''
says
he
,
quite
pleased
apparently
.
``
Well
,
now
,
Jim
,
I
've
*NL*
lived
that
rough
as
you
'd
be
ashamed
to
hear
of
.
Now
,
for
instance
,
you
*NL*
would
n't
think
I
had
had
a
pious
mother
--
to
look
at
me
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
not
in
particular
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
I
had
--
remarkable
pious
.
And
I
was
a
civil
,
*NL*
pious
boy
,
and
could
rattle
off
my
catechism
that
fast
,
as
you
could
n't
*NL*
tell
one
word
from
another
.
And
here
's
what
it
come
to
,
Jim
,
and
it
*NL*
begun
with
chuck-farthen
on
the
blessed
grave-stones
!
That
's
what
it
*NL*
begun
with
,
but
it
went
further
'n
that
;
and
so
my
mother
told
me
,
and
*NL*
predicked
the
whole
,
she
did
,
the
pious
woman
!
But
it
were
Providence
*NL*
that
put
me
here
.
I
've
thought
it
all
out
in
this
here
lonely
island
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
back
on
piety
.
You
do
n't
catch
me
tasting
rum
so
much
,
but
just
*NL*
a
thimbleful
for
luck
,
of
course
,
the
first
chance
I
have
.
I
'm
bound
*NL*
I
'll
be
good
,
and
I
see
the
way
to
.
And
,
Jim
''
--
looking
all
round
him
and
*NL*
lowering
his
voice
to
a
whisper
--
``
I
'm
rich
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
felt
sure
that
the
poor
fellow
had
gone
crazy
in
his
solitude
,
and
*NL*
I
suppose
I
must
have
shown
the
feeling
in
my
face
,
for
he
repeated
the
*NL*
statement
hotly
:
``
Rich
!
Rich
!
I
says
.
And
I
'll
tell
you
what
:
I
'll
make
*NL*
a
man
of
you
,
Jim
.
Ah
,
Jim
,
you
'll
bless
your
stars
,
you
will
,
you
was
*NL*
the
first
that
found
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
this
there
came
suddenly
a
lowering
shadow
over
his
face
,
and
he
*NL*
tightened
his
grasp
upon
my
hand
and
raised
a
forefinger
threateningly
*NL*
before
my
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Jim
,
you
tell
me
true
:
that
ai
n't
Flint
's
ship
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
I
had
a
happy
inspiration
.
I
began
to
believe
that
I
had
found
*NL*
an
ally
,
and
I
answered
him
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
Flint
's
ship
,
and
Flint
is
dead
;
but
I
'll
tell
you
true
,
as
*NL*
you
ask
me
--
there
are
some
of
Flint
's
hands
aboard
;
worse
luck
for
the
*NL*
rest
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
man
--
with
one
--
leg
?
''
he
gasped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silver
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Silver
!
''
says
he
.
``
That
were
his
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
the
cook
,
and
the
ringleader
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
holding
me
by
the
wrist
,
and
at
that
he
give
it
quite
a
*NL*
wring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
was
sent
by
Long
John
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'm
as
good
as
pork
,
and
I
*NL*
know
it
.
But
where
was
you
,
do
you
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
made
my
mind
up
in
a
moment
,
and
by
way
of
answer
told
him
*NL*
the
whole
story
of
our
voyage
and
the
predicament
in
which
we
found
*NL*
ourselves
.
He
heard
me
with
the
keenest
interest
,
and
when
I
had
done
he
*NL*
patted
me
on
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
good
lad
,
Jim
,
''
he
said
;
``
and
you
're
all
in
a
clove
hitch
,
*NL*
ai
n't
you
?
Well
,
you
just
put
your
trust
in
Ben
Gunn
--
Ben
Gunn
's
the
man
*NL*
to
do
it
.
Would
you
think
it
likely
,
now
,
that
your
squire
would
prove
*NL*
a
liberal-minded
one
in
case
of
help
--
him
being
in
a
clove
hitch
,
as
you
*NL*
remark
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
the
squire
was
the
most
liberal
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
but
you
see
,
''
returned
Ben
Gunn
,
``
I
did
n't
mean
giving
me
a
gate
*NL*
to
keep
,
and
a
suit
of
livery
clothes
,
and
such
;
that
's
not
my
mark
,
*NL*
Jim
.
What
I
mean
is
,
would
he
be
likely
to
come
down
to
the
toon
of
,
say
*NL*
one
thousand
pounds
out
of
money
that
's
as
good
as
a
man
's
own
already
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
he
would
,
''
said
I.
``
As
it
was
,
all
hands
were
to
share
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
AND
a
passage
home
?
''
he
added
with
a
look
of
great
shrewdness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
I
cried
,
``
the
squire
's
a
gentleman
.
And
besides
,
if
we
got
rid
of
*NL*
the
others
,
we
should
want
you
to
help
work
the
vessel
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
he
,
``
so
you
would
.
''
And
he
seemed
very
much
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
So
much
I
'll
tell
you
,
and
no
*NL*
more
.
I
were
in
Flint
's
ship
when
he
buried
the
treasure
;
he
and
*NL*
six
along
--
six
strong
seamen
.
They
was
ashore
nigh
on
a
week
,
and
us
*NL*
standing
off
and
on
in
the
old
WALRUS
.
One
fine
day
up
went
the
signal
,
*NL*
and
here
come
Flint
by
himself
in
a
little
boat
,
and
his
head
done
up
in
*NL*
a
blue
scarf
.
The
sun
was
getting
up
,
and
mortal
white
he
looked
about
*NL*
the
cutwater
.
But
,
there
he
was
,
you
mind
,
and
the
six
all
dead
--
dead
*NL*
and
buried
.
How
he
done
it
,
not
a
man
aboard
us
could
make
out
.
It
was
*NL*
battle
,
murder
,
and
sudden
death
,
leastways
--
him
against
six
.
Billy
*NL*
Bones
was
the
mate
;
Long
John
,
he
was
quartermaster
;
and
they
asked
him
*NL*
where
the
treasure
was
.
`
Ah
,
'
says
he
,
`
you
can
go
ashore
,
if
you
like
,
*NL*
and
stay
,
'
he
says
;
`
but
as
for
the
ship
,
she
'll
beat
up
for
more
,
by
*NL*
thunder
!
'
That
's
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
in
another
ship
three
years
back
,
and
we
sighted
this
*NL*
island

`
Boys

'
said
I
,
`
here
's
Flint
's
treasure
;
let
's
land
and
find
*NL*
it
.
'
The
cap'n
was
displeased
at
that
,
but
my
messmates
were
all
of
a
*NL*
mind
and
landed
.
Twelve
days
they
looked
for
it
,
and
every
day
they
had
*NL*
the
worse
word
for
me
,
until
one
fine
morning
all
hands
went
aboard
.
`
As
*NL*
for
you
,
Benjamin
Gunn
,

says
they
,
`
here
's
a
musket
,
'
they
says
,
`
and
*NL*
a
spade
,
and
pick-axe
.
You
can
stay
here
and
find
Flint
's
money
for
*NL*
yourself

they
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Jim
,
three
years
have
I
been
here

and
not
a
bite
of
Christian
*NL*
diet
from
that
day
to
this
.
But
now
,
you
look
here
;
look
at
me
.
Do
I
*NL*
look
like
a
man
before
the
mast
?
No

says
you
.
Nor
I
were
n't
,
neither

I
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
he
winked
and
pinched
me
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
you
mention
them
words

he
went
on

Nor

Three
years
he
were
the
man
of
this
*NL*
island
,
light
and
dark
,
fair
and
rain
;
and
sometimes
he
would
maybe
*NL*
think
upon
a
prayer
-LRB-
says
you
-RRB-

and
sometimes
he
would
maybe
think
of
*NL*
his
old
mother

so
be
as
she
's
alive
-LRB-
you
'll
say
-RRB-
;
but
the
most
part
*NL*
of
Gunn
's
time
-LRB-
this
is
what
you
'll
say
-RRB-
--
the
most
part
of
his
time
was
*NL*
took
up
with
another
matter

And
then
you
'll
give
him
a
nip
,
like
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pinched
me
again
in
the
most
confidential
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
he
continued
,
``
then
you
'll
up

you
'll
say
this
:
Gunn
is
a
*NL*
good
man

'll
say
-RRB-
,
and
he
puts
a
precious
sight
more
confidence
--
a
*NL*
precious
sight
,
mind
that
--
in
a
gen
`
leman
born
than
in
these
gen

*NL*
of
fortune
,
having
been
one
hisself

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
said
,
``
I
do
n't
understand
one

But
that

how
am
I
to
get
on
board

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

said
he
,
``

Well

's
my

I
made
with
my
two
hands

I
keep
her
under

white
rock

If
the
worst

come
to
the
worst

we
might
try
that
after
dark

Hi
!

he
broke
out
.
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
just
then
,
although
the
sun
had
still
an
hour
or
two
to
run
,
all
the
*NL*
echoes
of
the
island
awoke
and
bellowed
to
the
thunder
of
a
cannon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
begun
to
fight
!
''
I
cried
.
``
Follow
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
began
to
run
towards
the
anchorage
,
my
terrors
all
forgotten
,
*NL*
while
close
at
my
side
the
marooned
man
in
his
goatskins
trotted
easily
*NL*
and
lightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Left
,
left

says
he
;
``
keep
to
your
left
hand

mate
Jim

Under
the
*NL*
trees
with
you

Theer
's
where
I
killed
my
first
goat

They
do
n't
come
*NL*
down
here
now

they
're
all
mastheaded
on

mountings

the
fear

Benjamin

Ah
!

there
's
the
cetemery

cemetery

he
must
have

``
You

a
Sunday
would
be
about

It

it
seemed
more
solemn

short-handed

So
he
kept
talking
as
I
ran
,
neither
expecting
nor
receiving
any
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cannon-shot
was
followed
after
a
considerable
interval
by
a
volley
*NL*
of
small
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
pause
,
and
then
,
not
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
front
of
me
,
I
*NL*
beheld
the

Jack
flutter
in
the
air
above
a
wood

Narrative
Continued
by
the
Doctor
:
How
the
Ship
Was
Abandoned
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
about
half
past
one
--
three
bells
in
the
sea
phrase
--
that
the
two
*NL*
boats
went
ashore
from
the
HISPANIOLA
.
The
captain
,
the
squire
,
and
I
*NL*
were
talking
matters
over
in
the
cabin
.
Had
there
been
a
breath
of
wind
,
*NL*
we
should
have
fallen
on
the
six
mutineers
who
were
left
aboard
with
*NL*
us
,
slipped
our
cable
,
and
away
to
sea
.
But
the
wind
was
wanting
;
and
*NL*
to
complete
our
helplessness
,
down
came
Hunter
with
the
news
that
Jim
*NL*
Hawkins
had
slipped
into
a
boat
and
was
gone
ashore
with
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
never
occurred
to
us
to
doubt
Jim
Hawkins
,
but
we
were
alarmed
for
*NL*
his
safety
.
With
the
men
in
the
temper
they
were
in
,
it
seemed
an
even
*NL*
chance
if
we
should
see
the
lad
again
.
We
ran
on
deck
.
The
pitch
was
*NL*
bubbling
in
the
seams
;
the
nasty
stench
of
the
place
turned
me
sick
;
*NL*
if
ever
a
man
smelt
fever
and
dysentery
,
it
was
in
that
abominable
*NL*
anchorage
.
The
six
scoundrels
were
sitting
grumbling
under
a
sail
in
the
*NL*
forecastle
;
ashore
we
could
see
the
gigs
made
fast
and
a
man
sitting
*NL*
in
each
,
hard
by
where
the
river
runs
in
.
One
of
them
was
whistling
*NL*
``
Lillibullero
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Waiting
was
a
strain
,
and
it
was
decided
that
Hunter
and
I
should
go
*NL*
ashore
with
the
jolly-boat
in
quest
of
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gigs
had
leaned
to
their
right
,
but
Hunter
and
I
pulled
straight
in
,
*NL*
in
the
direction
of
the
stockade
upon
the
chart
.
The
two
who
were
*NL*
left
guarding
their
boats
seemed
in
a
bustle
at
our
appearance
;
*NL*
``
Lillibullero
''
stopped
off
,
and
I
could
see
the
pair
discussing
what
*NL*
they
ought
to
do
.
Had
they
gone
and
told
Silver
,
all
might
have
turned
*NL*
out
differently
;
but
they
had
their
orders
,
I
suppose
,
and
decided
to
*NL*
sit
quietly
where
they
were
and
hark
back
again
to
``
Lillibullero
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
slight
bend
in
the
coast
,
and
I
steered
so
as
to
put
it
*NL*
between
us
;
even
before
we
landed
we
had
thus
lost
sight
of
the
gigs
.
*NL*
I
jumped
out
and
came
as
near
running
as
I
durst
,
with
a
big
silk
*NL*
handkerchief
under
my
hat
for
coolness
'
sake
and
a
brace
of
pistols
*NL*
ready
primed
for
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
gone
a
hundred
yards
when
I
reached
the
stockade
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
how
it
was
:
a
spring
of
clear
water
rose
almost
at
the
top
of
a
*NL*
knoll
.
Well
,
on
the
knoll
,
and
enclosing
the
spring
,
they
had
clapped
a
*NL*
stout
loghouse
fit
to
hold
two
score
of
people
on
a
pinch
and
loopholed
*NL*
for
musketry
on
either
side
.
All
round
this
they
had
cleared
a
wide
*NL*
space
,
and
then
the
thing
was
completed
by
a
paling
six
feet
high
,
*NL*
without
door
or
opening
,
too
strong
to
pull
down
without
time
and
labour
*NL*
and
too
open
to
shelter
the
besiegers
.
The
people
in
the
log-house
had
*NL*
them
in
every
way
;
they
stood
quiet
in
shelter
and
shot
the
others
like
*NL*
partridges
.
All
they
wanted
was
a
good
watch
and
food
;
for
,
short
of
a
*NL*
complete
surprise
,
they
might
have
held
the
place
against
a
regiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
particularly
took
my
fancy
was
the
spring
.
For
though
we
had
a
good
*NL*
enough
place
of
it
in
the
cabin
of
the
HISPANIOLA
,
with
plenty
of
arms
*NL*
and
ammunition
,
and
things
to
eat
,
and
excellent
wines
,
there
had
been
*NL*
one
thing
overlooked
--
we
had
no
water
.
I
was
thinking
this
over
when
*NL*
there
came
ringing
over
the
island
the
cry
of
a
man
at
the
point
of
*NL*
death
.
I
was
not
new
to
violent
death
--
I
have
served
his
Royal
Highness
*NL*
the
Duke
of
Cumberland
,
and
got
a
wound
myself
at
Fontenoy
--
but
I
know
*NL*
my
pulse
went
dot
and
carry
one
.
``
Jim
Hawkins
is
gone
,
''
was
my
first
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
something
to
have
been
an
old
soldier
,
but
more
still
to
have
been
*NL*
a
doctor
.
There
is
no
time
to
dilly-dally
in
our
work
.
And
so
now
I
made
*NL*
up
my
mind
instantly
,
and
with
no
time
lost
returned
to
the
shore
and
*NL*
jumped
on
board
the
jolly-boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
good
fortune
Hunter
pulled
a
good
oar
.
We
made
the
water
fly
,
and
the
*NL*
boat
was
soon
alongside
and
I
aboard
the
schooner
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
them
all
shaken
,
as
was
natural
.
The
squire
was
sitting
down
,
as
*NL*
white
as
a
sheet
,
thinking
of
the
harm
he
had
led
us
to
,
the
good
soul
!
*NL*
And
one
of
the
six
forecastle
hands
was
little
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
man
,
''
says
Captain
Smollett
,
nodding
towards
him
,
``
new
to
*NL*
this
work
.
He
came
nigh-hand
fainting
,
doctor
,
when
he
heard
the
cry
.
*NL*
Another
touch
of
the
rudder
and
that
man
would
join
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
my
plan
to
the
captain
,
and
between
us
we
settled
on
the
details
*NL*
of
its
accomplishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
put
old
Redruth
in
the
gallery
between
the
cabin
and
the
forecastle
,
*NL*
with
three
or
four
loaded
muskets
and
a
mattress
for
protection
.
Hunter
*NL*
brought
the
boat
round
under
the
stern-port
,
and
Joyce
and
I
set
to
work
*NL*
loading
her
with
powder
tins
,
muskets
,
bags
of
biscuits
,
kegs
of
pork
,
a
*NL*
cask
of
cognac
,
and
my
invaluable
medicine
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
squire
and
the
captain
stayed
on
deck
,
and
the
*NL*
latter
hailed
the
coxswain
,
who
was
the
principal
man
aboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Hands
,
''
he
said
,
``
here
are
two
of
us
with
a
brace
of
pistols
each
.
*NL*
If
any
one
of
you
six
make
a
signal
of
any
description
,
that
man
's
*NL*
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
a
good
deal
taken
aback
,
and
after
a
little
consultation
one
*NL*
and
all
tumbled
down
the
fore
companion
,
thinking
no
doubt
to
take
us
*NL*
on
the
rear
.
But
when
they
saw
Redruth
waiting
for
them
in
the
sparred
*NL*
galley
,
they
went
about
ship
at
once
,
and
a
head
popped
out
again
on
*NL*
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
,
dog
!
''
cries
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
head
popped
back
again
;
and
we
heard
no
more
,
for
the
time
,
of
*NL*
these
six
very
faint-hearted
seamen
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
,
tumbling
things
in
as
they
came
,
we
had
the
jolly-boat
*NL*
loaded
as
much
as
we
dared
.
Joyce
and
I
got
out
through
the
stern-port
,
*NL*
and
we
made
for
shore
again
as
fast
as
oars
could
take
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
second
trip
fairly
aroused
the
watchers
along
shore
.
``
Lillibullero
''
*NL*
was
dropped
again
;
and
just
before
we
lost
sight
of
them
behind
the
*NL*
little
point
,
one
of
them
whipped
ashore
and
disappeared
.
I
had
half
a
*NL*
mind
to
change
my
plan
and
destroy
their
boats
,
but
I
feared
that
Silver
*NL*
and
the
others
might
be
close
at
hand
,
and
all
might
very
well
be
lost
*NL*
by
trying
for
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
soon
touched
land
in
the
same
place
as
before
and
set
to
*NL*
provision
the
block
house
.
All
three
made
the
first
journey
,
heavily
*NL*
laden
,
and
tossed
our
stores
over
the
palisade
.
Then
,
leaving
Joyce
to
*NL*
guard
them
--
one
man
,
to
be
sure
,
but
with
half
a
dozen
muskets
--
Hunter
*NL*
and
I
returned
to
the
jolly-boat
and
loaded
ourselves
once
more
.
So
*NL*
we
proceeded
without
pausing
to
take
breath
,
till
the
whole
cargo
was
*NL*
bestowed
,
when
the
two
servants
took
up
their
position
in
the
block
*NL*
house
,
and
I
,
with
all
my
power
,
sculled
back
to
the
HISPANIOLA
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
we
should
have
risked
a
second
boat
load
seems
more
daring
than
it
*NL*
really
was
.
They
had
the
advantage
of
numbers
,
of
course
,
but
we
had
the
*NL*
advantage
of
arms
.
Not
one
of
the
men
ashore
had
a
musket
,
and
before
*NL*
they
could
get
within
range
for
pistol
shooting
,
we
flattered
ourselves
*NL*
we
should
be
able
to
give
a
good
account
of
a
half-dozen
at
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
was
waiting
for
me
at
the
stern
window
,
all
his
faintness
*NL*
gone
from
him
.
He
caught
the
painter
and
made
it
fast
,
and
we
fell
to
*NL*
loading
the
boat
for
our
very
lives
.
Pork
,
powder
,
and
biscuit
was
the
*NL*
cargo
,
with
only
a
musket
and
a
cutlass
apiece
for
the
squire
and
me
*NL*
and
Redruth
and
the
captain
.
The
rest
of
the
arms
and
powder
we
dropped
*NL*
overboard
in
two
fathoms
and
a
half
of
water
,
so
that
we
could
see
*NL*
the
bright
steel
shining
far
below
us
in
the
sun
,
on
the
clean
,
sandy
*NL*
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
tide
was
beginning
to
ebb
,
and
the
ship
was
swinging
*NL*
round
to
her
anchor
.
Voices
were
heard
faintly
halloaing
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
two
gigs
;
and
though
this
reassured
us
for
Joyce
and
*NL*
Hunter
,
who
were
well
to
the
eastward
,
it
warned
our
party
to
be
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Redruth
retreated
from
his
place
in
the
gallery
and
dropped
into
the
*NL*
boat
,
which
we
then
brought
round
to
the
ship
's
counter
,
to
be
handier
*NL*
for
Captain
Smollett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
men
,
''
said
he
,
``
do
you
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
from
the
forecastle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
to
you
,
Abraham
Gray
--
it
's
to
you
I
am
speaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gray
,
''
resumed
Mr.
Smollett
,
a
little
louder
,
``
I
am
leaving
this
ship
,
*NL*
and
I
order
you
to
follow
your
captain
.
I
know
you
are
a
good
man
at
*NL*
bottom
,
and
I
dare
say
not
one
of
the
lot
of
you
's
as
bad
as
he
makes
*NL*
out
.
I
have
my
watch
here
in
my
hand
;
I
give
you
thirty
seconds
to
join
*NL*
me
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
my
fine
fellow
,
''
continued
the
captain
;
``
do
n't
hang
so
long
in
*NL*
stays
.
I
'm
risking
my
life
and
the
lives
of
these
good
gentlemen
every
*NL*
second
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
sudden
scuffle
,
a
sound
of
blows
,
and
out
burst
Abraham
*NL*
Gray
with
a
knife
cut
on
the
side
of
the
cheek
,
and
came
running
to
the
*NL*
captain
like
a
dog
to
the
whistle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
with
you
,
sir
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
next
moment
he
and
the
captain
had
dropped
aboard
of
us
,
and
we
*NL*
had
shoved
off
and
given
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
clear
out
of
the
ship
,
but
not
yet
ashore
in
our
stockade
.

Narrative
Continued
by
the
Doctor
:
The
Jolly-boat
's
Last
Trip
*NL*
*NL*
THIS
fifth
trip
was
quite
different
from
any
of
the
others
.
In
the
*NL*
first
place
,
the
little
gallipot
of
a
boat
that
we
were
in
was
gravely
*NL*
overloaded
.
Five
grown
men
,
and
three
of
them
--
Trelawney
,
Redruth
,
and
*NL*
the
captain
--
over
six
feet
high
,
was
already
more
than
she
was
meant
*NL*
to
carry
.
Add
to
that
the
powder
,
pork
,
and
bread-bags
.
The
gunwale
was
*NL*
lipping
astern
.
Several
times
we
shipped
a
little
water
,
and
my
breeches
*NL*
and
the
tails
of
my
coat
were
all
soaking
wet
before
we
had
gone
a
*NL*
hundred
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
made
us
trim
the
boat
,
and
we
got
her
to
lie
a
little
more
*NL*
evenly
.
All
the
same
,
we
were
afraid
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
place
,
the
ebb
was
now
making
--
a
strong
rippling
current
*NL*
running
westward
through
the
basin
,
and
then
south
`
ard
and
seaward
down
*NL*
the
straits
by
which
we
had
entered
in
the
morning
.
Even
the
ripples
*NL*
were
a
danger
to
our
overloaded
craft
,
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
we
*NL*
were
swept
out
of
our
true
course
and
away
from
our
proper
landing-place
*NL*
behind
the
point
.
If
we
let
the
current
have
its
way
we
should
come
*NL*
ashore
beside
the
gigs
,
where
the
pirates
might
appear
at
any
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
keep
her
head
for
the
stockade
,
sir
,
''
said
I
to
the
captain
.
*NL*
I
was
steering
,
while
he
and
Redruth
,
two
fresh
men
,
were
at
the
oars
.
*NL*
``
The
tide
keeps
washing
her
down
.
Could
you
pull
a
little
stronger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
without
swamping
the
boat
,
''
said
he
.
``
You
must
bear
up
,
sir
,
if
you
*NL*
please
--
bear
up
until
you
see
you
're
gaining
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tried
and
found
by
experiment
that
the
tide
kept
sweeping
us
westward
*NL*
until
I
had
laid
her
head
due
east
,
or
just
about
right
angles
to
the
*NL*
way
we
ought
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
never
get
ashore
at
this
rate
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
's
the
only
course
that
we
can
lie
,
sir
,
we
must
even
lie
it
,
''
*NL*
returned
the
captain
.
``
We
must
keep
upstream
.
You
see
,
sir
,
''
he
went
on
,
*NL*
``
if
once
we
dropped
to
leeward
of
the
landing-place
,
it
's
hard
to
say
*NL*
where
we
should
get
ashore
,
besides
the
chance
of
being
boarded
by
the
*NL*
gigs
;
whereas
,
the
way
we
go
the
current
must
slacken
,
and
then
we
can
*NL*
dodge
back
along
the
shore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
current
's
less
a
`
ready
,
sir
,
''
said
the
man
Gray
,
who
was
sitting
in
*NL*
the
fore-sheets
;
``
you
can
ease
her
off
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
my
man
,
''
said
I
,
quite
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
for
we
*NL*
had
all
quietly
made
up
our
minds
to
treat
him
like
one
of
ourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
captain
spoke
up
again
,
and
I
thought
his
voice
was
a
*NL*
little
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gun
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
thought
of
that
,
''
said
I
,
for
I
made
sure
he
was
thinking
of
a
*NL*
bombardment
of
the
fort
.
``
They
could
never
get
the
gun
ashore
,
and
if
*NL*
they
did
,
they
could
never
haul
it
through
the
woods
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
astern
,
doctor
,
''
replied
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
entirely
forgotten
the
long
nine
;
and
there
,
to
our
horror
,
were
*NL*
the
five
rogues
busy
about
her
,
getting
off
her
jacket
,
as
they
called
*NL*
the
stout
tarpaulin
cover
under
which
she
sailed
.
Not
only
that
,
but
*NL*
it
flashed
into
my
mind
at
the
same
moment
that
the
round-shot
and
the
*NL*
powder
for
the
gun
had
been
left
behind
,
and
a
stroke
with
an
axe
would
*NL*
put
it
all
into
the
possession
of
the
evil
ones
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Israel
was
Flint
's
gunner
,
''
said
Gray
hoarsely
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
risk
,
we
put
the
boat
's
head
direct
for
the
landing-place
.
By
*NL*
this
time
we
had
got
so
far
out
of
the
run
of
the
current
that
we
kept
*NL*
steerage
way
even
at
our
necessarily
gentle
rate
of
rowing
,
and
I
could
*NL*
keep
her
steady
for
the
goal
.
But
the
worst
of
it
was
that
with
the
*NL*
course
I
now
held
we
turned
our
broadside
instead
of
our
stern
to
the
*NL*
HISPANIOLA
and
offered
a
target
like
a
barn
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
hear
as
well
as
see
that
brandy-faced
rascal
Israel
Hands
*NL*
plumping
down
a
round-shot
on
the
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
the
best
shot
?
''
asked
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Trelawney
,
out
and
away
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Trelawney
,
will
you
please
pick
me
off
one
of
these
men
,
sir
?
*NL*
Hands
,
if
possible
,
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Trelawney
was
as
cool
as
steel
.
He
looked
to
the
priming
of
his
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
cried
the
captain
,
``
easy
with
that
gun
,
sir
,
or
you
'll
swamp
the
*NL*
boat
.
All
hands
stand
by
to
trim
her
when
he
aims
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
raised
his
gun
,
the
rowing
ceased
,
and
we
leaned
over
to
the
*NL*
other
side
to
keep
the
balance
,
and
all
was
so
nicely
contrived
that
we
*NL*
did
not
ship
a
drop
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
the
gun
,
by
this
time
,
slewed
round
upon
the
swivel
,
and
Hands
,
*NL*
who
was
at
the
muzzle
with
the
rammer
,
was
in
consequence
the
most
*NL*
exposed
.
However
,
we
had
no
luck
,
for
just
as
Trelawney
fired
,
down
he
*NL*
stooped
,
the
ball
whistled
over
him
,
and
it
was
one
of
the
other
four
*NL*
who
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cry
he
gave
was
echoed
not
only
by
his
companions
on
board
but
by
a
*NL*
great
number
of
voices
from
the
shore
,
and
looking
in
that
direction
*NL*
I
saw
the
other
pirates
trooping
out
from
among
the
trees
and
tumbling
*NL*
into
their
places
in
the
boats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
come
the
gigs
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
way
,
then
,
''
cried
the
captain
.
``
We
must
n't
mind
if
we
swamp
her
*NL*
now
.
If
we
ca
n't
get
ashore
,
all
's
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
one
of
the
gigs
is
being
manned
,
sir
,
''
I
added
;
``
the
crew
of
the
*NL*
other
most
likely
going
round
by
shore
to
cut
us
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
'll
have
a
hot
run
,
sir
,
''
returned
the
captain
.
``
Jack
ashore
,
you
*NL*
know
.
It
's
not
them
I
mind
;
it
's
the
round-shot
.
Carpet
bowls
!
My
lady
's
*NL*
maid
could
n't
miss
.
Tell
us
,
squire
,
when
you
see
the
match
,
and
we
'll
*NL*
hold
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
we
had
been
making
headway
at
a
good
pace
for
a
boat
so
*NL*
overloaded
,
and
we
had
shipped
but
little
water
in
the
process
.
We
were
*NL*
now
close
in
;
thirty
or
forty
strokes
and
we
should
beach
her
,
for
the
*NL*
ebb
had
already
disclosed
a
narrow
belt
of
sand
below
the
clustering
*NL*
trees
.
The
gig
was
no
longer
to
be
feared
;
the
little
point
had
already
*NL*
concealed
it
from
our
eyes
.
The
ebb-tide
,
which
had
so
cruelly
delayed
*NL*
us
,
was
now
making
reparation
and
delaying
our
assailants
.
The
one
*NL*
source
of
danger
was
the
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
durst
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
I
'd
stop
and
pick
off
another
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
plain
that
they
meant
nothing
should
delay
their
shot
.
They
*NL*
had
never
so
much
as
looked
at
their
fallen
comrade
,
though
he
was
not
*NL*
dead
,
and
I
could
see
him
trying
to
crawl
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ready
!
''
cried
the
squire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
cried
the
captain
,
quick
as
an
echo
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
and
Redruth
backed
with
a
great
heave
that
sent
her
stern
bodily
*NL*
under
water
.
The
report
fell
in
at
the
same
instant
of
time
.
This
was
*NL*
the
first
that
Jim
heard
,
the
sound
of
the
squire
's
shot
not
having
*NL*
reached
him
.
Where
the
ball
passed
,
not
one
of
us
precisely
knew
,
but
I
*NL*
fancy
it
must
have
been
over
our
heads
and
that
the
wind
of
it
may
have
*NL*
contributed
to
our
disaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
any
rate
,
the
boat
sank
by
the
stern
,
quite
gently
,
in
three
feet
of
*NL*
water
,
leaving
the
captain
and
myself
,
facing
each
other
,
on
our
feet
.
*NL*
The
other
three
took
complete
headers
,
and
came
up
again
drenched
and
*NL*
bubbling
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
there
was
no
great
harm
.
No
lives
were
lost
,
and
we
could
wade
*NL*
ashore
in
safety
.
But
there
were
all
our
stores
at
the
bottom
,
and
to
*NL*
make
things
worse
,
only
two
guns
out
of
five
remained
in
a
state
for
*NL*
service
.
Mine
I
had
snatched
from
my
knees
and
held
over
my
head
,
by
*NL*
a
sort
of
instinct
.
As
for
the
captain
,
he
had
carried
his
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
by
a
bandoleer
,
and
like
a
wise
man
,
lock
uppermost
.
The
other
*NL*
three
had
gone
down
with
the
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
add
to
our
concern
,
we
heard
voices
already
drawing
near
us
in
the
*NL*
woods
along
shore
,
and
we
had
not
only
the
danger
of
being
cut
off
from
*NL*
the
stockade
in
our
half-crippled
state
but
the
fear
before
us
whether
,
*NL*
if
Hunter
and
Joyce
were
attacked
by
half
a
dozen
,
they
would
have
the
*NL*
sense
and
conduct
to
stand
firm
.
Hunter
was
steady
,
that
we
knew
;
Joyce
*NL*
was
a
doubtful
case
--
a
pleasant
,
polite
man
for
a
valet
and
to
brush
*NL*
one
's
clothes
,
but
not
entirely
fitted
for
a
man
of
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
this
in
our
minds
,
we
waded
ashore
as
fast
as
we
could
,
leaving
*NL*
behind
us
the
poor
jolly-boat
and
a
good
half
of
all
our
powder
and
*NL*
provisions
.

Narrative
Continued
by
the
Doctor
:
End
of
the
First
Day
's
Fighting
*NL*
*NL*
WE
made
our
best
speed
across
the
strip
of
wood
that
now
divided
us
from
*NL*
the
stockade
,
and
at
every
step
we
took
the
voices
of
the
buccaneers
*NL*
rang
nearer
.
Soon
we
could
hear
their
footfalls
as
they
ran
and
the
*NL*
cracking
of
the
branches
as
they
breasted
across
a
bit
of
thicket
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
see
we
should
have
a
brush
for
it
in
earnest
and
looked
to
my
*NL*
priming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
said
I
,
``
Trelawney
is
the
dead
shot
.
Give
him
your
gun
;
his
*NL*
own
is
useless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
exchanged
guns
,
and
Trelawney
,
silent
and
cool
as
he
had
been
since
*NL*
the
beginning
of
the
bustle
,
hung
a
moment
on
his
heel
to
see
that
all
*NL*
was
fit
for
service
.
At
the
same
time
,
observing
Gray
to
be
unarmed
,
I
*NL*
handed
him
my
cutlass
.
It
did
all
our
hearts
good
to
see
him
spit
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
knit
his
brows
,
and
make
the
blade
sing
through
the
air
.
It
was
*NL*
plain
from
every
line
of
his
body
that
our
new
hand
was
worth
his
salt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Forty
paces
farther
we
came
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
saw
the
stockade
*NL*
in
front
of
us
.
We
struck
the
enclosure
about
the
middle
of
the
south
*NL*
side
,
and
almost
at
the
same
time
,
seven
mutineers
--
Job
Anderson
,
the
*NL*
boatswain
,
at
their
head
--
appeared
in
full
cry
at
the
southwestern
*NL*
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
paused
as
if
taken
aback
,
and
before
they
recovered
,
not
only
the
*NL*
squire
and
I
,
but
Hunter
and
Joyce
from
the
block
house
,
had
time
to
*NL*
fire
.
The
four
shots
came
in
rather
a
scattering
volley
,
but
they
did
*NL*
the
business
:
one
of
the
enemy
actually
fell
,
and
the
rest
,
without
*NL*
hesitation
,
turned
and
plunged
into
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
reloading
,
we
walked
down
the
outside
of
the
palisade
to
see
to
*NL*
the
fallen
enemy
.
He
was
stone
dead
--
shot
through
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
began
to
rejoice
over
our
good
success
when
just
at
that
moment
a
*NL*
pistol
cracked
in
the
bush
,
a
ball
whistled
close
past
my
ear
,
and
poor
*NL*
Tom
Redruth
stumbled
and
fell
his
length
on
the
ground
.
Both
the
squire
*NL*
and
I
returned
the
shot
,
but
as
we
had
nothing
to
aim
at
,
it
is
probable
*NL*
we
only
wasted
powder
.
Then
we
reloaded
and
turned
our
attention
to
poor
*NL*
Tom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
and
Gray
were
already
examining
him
,
and
I
saw
with
half
an
*NL*
eye
that
all
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
the
readiness
of
our
return
volley
had
scattered
the
mutineers
*NL*
once
more
,
for
we
were
suffered
without
further
molestation
to
get
the
*NL*
poor
old
gamekeeper
hoisted
over
the
stockade
and
carried
,
groaning
and
*NL*
bleeding
,
into
the
log-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
old
fellow
,
he
had
not
uttered
one
word
of
surprise
,
complaint
,
*NL*
fear
,
or
even
acquiescence
from
the
very
beginning
of
our
troubles
till
*NL*
now
,
when
we
had
laid
him
down
in
the
log-house
to
die
.
He
had
lain
like
*NL*
a
Trojan
behind
his
mattress
in
the
gallery
;
he
had
followed
every
order
*NL*
silently
,
doggedly
,
and
well
;
he
was
the
oldest
of
our
party
by
a
score
*NL*
of
years
;
and
now
,
sullen
,
old
,
serviceable
servant
,
it
was
he
that
was
*NL*
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
squire
dropped
down
beside
him
on
his
knees
and
kissed
his
hand
,
*NL*
crying
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
I
going
,
doctor
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
my
man
,
''
said
I
,
``
you
're
going
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
had
a
lick
at
them
with
the
gun
first
,
''
he
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
,
''
said
the
squire
,
``
say
you
forgive
me
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
that
be
respectful
like
,
from
me
to
you
,
squire
?
''
was
the
answer
.
*NL*
``
Howsoever
,
so
be
it
,
amen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
while
of
silence
,
he
said
he
thought
somebody
might
read
*NL*
a
prayer
.
``
It
's
the
custom
,
sir
,
''
he
added
apologetically
.
And
not
long
*NL*
after
,
without
another
word
,
he
passed
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
the
captain
,
whom
I
had
observed
to
be
wonderfully
*NL*
swollen
about
the
chest
and
pockets
,
had
turned
out
a
great
many
various
*NL*
stores
--
the
British
colours
,
a
Bible
,
a
coil
of
stoutish
rope
,
pen
,
ink
,
*NL*
the
log-book
,
and
pounds
of
tobacco
.
He
had
found
a
longish
fir-tree
*NL*
lying
felled
and
trimmed
in
the
enclosure
,
and
with
the
help
of
Hunter
*NL*
he
had
set
it
up
at
the
corner
of
the
log-house
where
the
trunks
crossed
*NL*
and
made
an
angle
.
Then
,
climbing
on
the
roof
,
he
had
with
his
own
hand
*NL*
bent
and
run
up
the
colours
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
mightily
to
relieve
him
.
He
re-entered
the
log-house
and
set
*NL*
about
counting
up
the
stores
as
if
nothing
else
existed
.
But
he
had
an
*NL*
eye
on
Tom
's
passage
for
all
that
,
and
as
soon
as
all
was
over
,
came
*NL*
forward
with
another
flag
and
reverently
spread
it
on
the
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
take
on
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
shaking
the
squire
's
hand
.
``
All
's
*NL*
well
with
him
;
no
fear
for
a
hand
that
's
been
shot
down
in
his
duty
to
*NL*
captain
and
owner
.
It
may
n't
be
good
divinity
,
but
it
's
a
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
pulled
me
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Livesey
,
''
he
said
,
``
in
how
many
weeks
do
you
and
squire
expect
the
*NL*
consort
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
him
it
was
a
question
not
of
weeks
but
of
months
,
that
if
we
*NL*
were
not
back
by
the
end
of
August
Blandly
was
to
send
to
find
us
,
but
*NL*
neither
sooner
nor
later
.
``
You
can
calculate
for
yourself
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
returned
the
captain
,
scratching
his
head
;
``
and
making
a
*NL*
large
allowance
,
sir
,
for
all
the
gifts
of
Providence
,
I
should
say
we
*NL*
were
pretty
close
hauled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
,
sir
,
we
lost
that
second
load
.
That
's
what
I
mean
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
captain
.
``
As
for
powder
and
shot
,
we
'll
do
.
But
the
rations
*NL*
are
short
,
very
short
--
so
short
,
Dr.
Livesey
,
that
we
're
perhaps
as
well
*NL*
without
that
extra
mouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pointed
to
the
dead
body
under
the
flag
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
,
with
a
roar
and
a
whistle
,
a
round-shot
passed
high
above
the
*NL*
roof
of
the
log-house
and
plumped
far
beyond
us
in
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oho
!
''
said
the
captain
.
``
Blaze
away
!
You
've
little
enough
powder
*NL*
already
,
my
lads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
second
trial
,
the
aim
was
better
,
and
the
ball
descended
inside
*NL*
the
stockade
,
scattering
a
cloud
of
sand
but
doing
no
further
damage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Captain
,
''
said
the
squire
,
``
the
house
is
quite
invisible
from
the
ship
.
*NL*
It
must
be
the
flag
they
are
aiming
at
.
Would
it
not
be
wiser
to
take
it
*NL*
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strike
my
colours
!
''
cried
the
captain
.
``
No
,
sir
,
not
I
''
;
and
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
had
said
the
words
,
I
think
we
all
agreed
with
him
.
For
it
was
*NL*
not
only
a
piece
of
stout
,
seamanly
,
good
feeling
;
it
was
good
policy
*NL*
besides
and
showed
our
enemies
that
we
despised
their
cannonade
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
through
the
evening
they
kept
thundering
away
.
Ball
after
ball
flew
*NL*
over
or
fell
short
or
kicked
up
the
sand
in
the
enclosure
,
but
they
had
*NL*
to
fire
so
high
that
the
shot
fell
dead
and
buried
itself
in
the
soft
*NL*
sand
.
We
had
no
ricochet
to
fear
,
and
though
one
popped
in
through
the
*NL*
roof
of
the
log-house
and
out
again
through
the
floor
,
we
soon
got
used
*NL*
to
that
sort
of
horse-play
and
minded
it
no
more
than
cricket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
one
good
thing
about
all
this
,
''
observed
the
captain
;
``
the
*NL*
wood
in
front
of
us
is
likely
clear
.
The
ebb
has
made
a
good
while
;
our
*NL*
stores
should
be
uncovered
.
Volunteers
to
go
and
bring
in
pork
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gray
and
Hunter
were
the
first
to
come
forward
.
Well
armed
,
they
stole
*NL*
out
of
the
stockade
,
but
it
proved
a
useless
mission
.
The
mutineers
were
*NL*
bolder
than
we
fancied
or
they
put
more
trust
in
Israel
's
gunnery
.
For
*NL*
four
or
five
of
them
were
busy
carrying
off
our
stores
and
wading
out
*NL*
with
them
to
one
of
the
gigs
that
lay
close
by
,
pulling
an
oar
or
so
to
*NL*
hold
her
steady
against
the
current
.
Silver
was
in
the
stern-sheets
in
*NL*
command
;
and
every
man
of
them
was
now
provided
with
a
musket
from
some
*NL*
secret
magazine
of
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
sat
down
to
his
log
,
and
here
is
the
beginning
of
the
entry
:
*NL*
*NL*
Alexander
Smollett
,
master
;
David
Livesey
,
ship
's
*NL*
doctor
;
Abraham
Gray
,
carpenter
's
mate
;
John
*NL*
Trelawney
,
owner
;
John
Hunter
and
Richard
Joyce
,
*NL*
owner
's
servants
,
landsmen
--
being
all
that
is
left
*NL*
faithful
of
the
ship
's
company
--
with
stores
for
ten
*NL*
days
at
short
rations
,
came
ashore
this
day
and
flew
*NL*
British
colours
on
the
log-house
in
Treasure
Island
.
*NL*
Thomas
Redruth
,
owner
's
servant
,
landsman
,
shot
by
the
*NL*
mutineers
;
James
Hawkins
,
cabin-boy
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
the
same
time
,
I
was
wondering
over
poor
Jim
Hawkins
'
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hail
on
the
land
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Somebody
hailing
us
,
''
said
Hunter
,
who
was
on
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
!
Squire
!
Captain
!
Hullo
,
Hunter
,
is
that
you
?
''
came
the
cries
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
ran
to
the
door
in
time
to
see
Jim
Hawkins
,
safe
and
sound
,
come
*NL*
climbing
over
the
stockade
.

Narrative
Resumed
by
Jim
Hawkins
:
The
Garrison
in
the
Stockade
*NL*
*NL*
AS
soon
as
Ben
Gunn
saw
the
colours
he
came
to
a
halt
,
stopped
me
by
the
*NL*
arm
,
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
there
's
your
friends
,
sure
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
more
likely
it
's
the
mutineers
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Why
,
in
a
place
like
this
,
where
nobody
puts
in
but
*NL*
gen
`
lemen
of
fortune
,
Silver
would
fly
the
Jolly
Roger
,
you
do
n't
make
*NL*
no
doubt
of
that
.
No
,
that
's
your
friends
.
There
's
been
blows
too
,
and
I
*NL*
reckon
your
friends
has
had
the
best
of
it
;
and
here
they
are
ashore
in
*NL*
the
old
stockade
,
as
was
made
years
and
years
ago
by
Flint
.
Ah
,
he
was
*NL*
the
man
to
have
a
headpiece
,
was
Flint
!
Barring
rum
,
his
match
were
*NL*
never
seen
.
He
were
afraid
of
none
,
not
he
;
on
'
y
Silver
--
Silver
was
that
*NL*
genteel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
may
be
so
,
and
so
be
it
;
all
the
more
reason
that
*NL*
I
should
hurry
on
and
join
my
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nay
,
mate
,
''
returned
Ben
,
``
not
you
.
You
're
a
good
boy
,
or
I
'm
mistook
;
*NL*
but
you
're
on

a
boy
,
all
told
.
Now
,
Ben
Gunn
is
fly
.
Rum
would
n't
*NL*
bring
me
there
,
where
you
're
going

not

till
I
see
your
*NL*
born
gen
`

and
gets
it
on
his
word
of
honour

And
you
wo
n't

*NL*
my
words

A
precious

that
's
what
you
'll

,
a
precious
sight
*NL*
more
confidence

--
and
then
nips
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pinched
me
the
third
time
with
the
same
air
of
cleverness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
Ben
Gunn
is
wanted
,
you
know
where
to
find
him

Jim

Just
*NL*
wheer
you
found
him
today
.
And
him
that
comes
is
to
have
a
white
thing
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
and
he
's
to
come
alone
.
Oh
!
And
you
'll
say
this
:
`
Ben
*NL*
Gunn
,
'
says
you
,
`
has
reasons
of
his
own
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
believe
I
understand
.
You
have
something
to
propose
,
*NL*
and
you
wish
to
see
the
squire
or
the
doctor
,
and
you
're
to
be
found
*NL*
where
I
found
you

Is
that
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
?
says
you
,
''
he
added
.
``
Why
,
from
about
noon
observation
to
*NL*
about
six
bells
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

said
I
,
``
and
now
may
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
forget
?
''
he
inquired
anxiously
.
``
Precious
sight
,
and
reasons
*NL*
of
his
own

says
you
.
Reasons
of
his
own
;
that
's
the
mainstay
;
as
*NL*
between
man
and
man
.
Well
,
then
''
--
still
holding
me
--
``
I
reckon
you
can
*NL*
go
,
Jim
.
And
,
Jim
,
if
you
was
to
see
Silver
,
you
would
n't
go
for
to
sell
*NL*
Ben
Gunn
?
Wild
horses
would
n't
draw
it
from
you
?
No
,
says
you
.
And
if
*NL*
them
pirates
camp
ashore
,
Jim
,
what
would
you
say
but
there
'd
be
widders
*NL*
in
the
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
was
interrupted
by
a
loud
report
,
and
a
cannonball
came
tearing
*NL*
through
the
trees
and
pitched
in
the
sand
not
a
hundred
yards
from
where
*NL*
we
two
were
talking
.
The
next
moment
each
of
us
had
taken
to
his
heels
*NL*
in
a
different
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
good
hour
to
come
frequent
reports
shook
the
island
,
and
*NL*
balls
kept
crashing
through
the
woods
.
I
moved
from
hiding-place
to
*NL*
hiding-place
,
always
pursued
,
or
so
it
seemed
to
me
,
by
these
terrifying
*NL*
missiles
.
But
towards
the
end
of
the
bombardment
,
though
still
I
durst
*NL*
not
venture
in
the
direction
of
the
stockade
,
where
the
balls
fell
*NL*
oftenest
,
I
had
begun
,
in
a
manner
,
to
pluck
up
my
heart
again
,
and
*NL*
after
a
long
detour
to
the
east
,
crept
down
among
the
shore-side
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
just
set
,
the
sea
breeze
was
rustling
and
tumbling
in
the
*NL*
woods
and
ruffling
the
grey
surface
of
the
anchorage
;
the
tide
,
too
,
was
*NL*
far
out
,
and
great
tracts
of
sand
lay
uncovered
;
the
air
,
after
the
heat
*NL*
of
the
day
,
chilled
me
through
my
jacket
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
HISPANIOLA
still
lay
where
she
had
anchored
;
but
,
sure
enough
,
there
*NL*
was
the
Jolly
Roger
--
the
black
flag
of
piracy
--
flying
from
her
peak
.
*NL*
Even
as
I
looked
,
there
came
another
red
flash
and
another
report
that
*NL*
sent
the
echoes
clattering
,
and
one
more
round-shot
whistled
through
the
*NL*
air
.
It
was
the
last
of
the
cannonade
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lay
for
some
time
watching
the
bustle
which
succeeded
the
attack
.
Men
*NL*
were
demolishing
something
with
axes
on
the
beach
near
the
stockade
--
the
*NL*
poor
jolly-boat
,
I
afterwards
discovered
.
Away
,
near
the
mouth
of
the
*NL*
river
,
a
great
fire
was
glowing
among
the
trees
,
and
between
that
point
*NL*
and
the
ship
one
of
the
gigs
kept
coming
and
going
,
the
men
,
whom
I
*NL*
had
seen
so
gloomy
,
shouting
at
the
oars
like
children
.
But
there
was
a
*NL*
sound
in
their
voices
which
suggested
rum
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
I
thought
I
might
return
towards
the
stockade
.
I
was
pretty
*NL*
far
down
on
the
low
,
sandy
spit
that
encloses
the
anchorage
to
the
east
,
*NL*
and
is
joined
at
half-water
to
Skeleton
Island
;
and
now
,
as
I
rose
to
my
*NL*
feet
,
I
saw
,
some
distance
further
down
the
spit
and
rising
from
among
*NL*
low
bushes
,
an
isolated
rock
,
pretty
high
,
and
peculiarly
white
in
*NL*
colour
.
It
occurred
to
me
that
this
might
be
the
white
rock
of
which
Ben
*NL*
Gunn
had
spoken
and
that
some
day
or
other
a
boat
might
be
wanted
and
I
*NL*
should
know
where
to
look
for
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
skirted
among
the
woods
until
I
had
regained
the
rear
,
or
*NL*
shoreward
side
,
of
the
stockade
,
and
was
soon
warmly
welcomed
by
the
*NL*
faithful
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
soon
told
my
story
and
began
to
look
about
me
.
The
log-house
was
*NL*
made
of
unsquared
trunks
of
pine
--
roof
,
walls
,
and
floor
.
The
latter
*NL*
stood
in
several
places
as
much
as
a
foot
or
a
foot
and
a
half
above
the
*NL*
surface
of
the
sand
.
There
was
a
porch
at
the
door
,
and
under
this
porch
*NL*
the
little
spring
welled
up
into
an
artificial
basin
of
a
rather
odd
*NL*
kind
--
no
other
than
a
great
ship
's
kettle
of
iron
,
with
the
bottom
*NL*
knocked
out
,
and
sunk
``
to
her
bearings
,
''
as
the
captain
said
,
among
the
*NL*
sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
had
been
left
besides
the
framework
of
the
house
,
but
in
one
*NL*
corner
there
was
a
stone
slab
laid
down
by
way
of
hearth
and
an
old
*NL*
rusty
iron
basket
to
contain
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
slopes
of
the
knoll
and
all
the
inside
of
the
stockade
had
been
*NL*
cleared
of
timber
to
build
the
house
,
and
we
could
see
by
the
stumps
*NL*
what
a
fine
and
lofty
grove
had
been
destroyed
.
Most
of
the
soil
had
*NL*
been
washed
away
or
buried
in
drift
after
the
removal
of
the
trees
;
only
*NL*
where
the
streamlet
ran
down
from
the
kettle
a
thick
bed
of
moss
and
*NL*
some
ferns
and
little
creeping
bushes
were
still
green
among
the
sand
.
*NL*
Very
close
around
the
stockade
--
too
close
for
defence
,
they
said
--
the
*NL*
wood
still
flourished
high
and
dense
,
all
of
fir
on
the
land
side
,
but
*NL*
towards
the
sea
with
a
large
admixture
of
live-oaks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cold
evening
breeze
,
of
which
I
have
spoken
,
whistled
through
every
*NL*
chink
of
the
rude
building
and
sprinkled
the
floor
with
a
continual
rain
*NL*
of
fine
sand
.
There
was
sand
in
our
eyes
,
sand
in
our
teeth
,
sand
in
our
*NL*
suppers
,
sand
dancing
in
the
spring
at
the
bottom
of
the
kettle
,
for
all
*NL*
the
world
like
porridge
beginning
to
boil
.
Our
chimney
was
a
square
hole
*NL*
in
the
roof
;
it
was
but
a
little
part
of
the
smoke
that
found
its
way
*NL*
out
,
and
the
rest
eddied
about
the
house
and
kept
us
coughing
and
piping
*NL*
the
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Add
to
this
that
Gray
,
the
new
man
,
had
his
face
tied
up
in
a
bandage
*NL*
for
a
cut
he
had
got
in
breaking
away
from
the
mutineers
and
that
poor
*NL*
old
Tom
Redruth
,
still
unburied
,
lay
along
the
wall
,
stiff
and
stark
,
*NL*
under
the
Union
Jack
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
had
been
allowed
to
sit
idle
,
we
should
all
have
fallen
in
the
*NL*
blues
,
but
Captain
Smollett
was
never
the
man
for
that
.
All
hands
were
*NL*
called
up
before
him
,
and
he
divided
us
into
watches
.
The
doctor
and
*NL*
Gray
and
I
for
one
;
the
squire
,
Hunter
,
and
Joyce
upon
the
other
.
Tired
*NL*
though
we
all
were
,
two
were
sent
out
for
firewood
;
two
more
were
set
to
*NL*
dig
a
grave
for
Redruth
;
the
doctor
was
named
cook
;
I
was
put
sentry
at
*NL*
the
door
;
and
the
captain
himself
went
from
one
to
another
,
keeping
up
*NL*
our
spirits
and
lending
a
hand
wherever
it
was
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
the
doctor
came
to
the
door
for
a
little
air
and
to
*NL*
rest
his
eyes
,
which
were
almost
smoked
out
of
his
head
,
and
whenever
he
*NL*
did
so
,
he
had
a
word
for
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
Smollett
,
''
he
said
once
,
``
is
a
better
man
than
I
am
.
And
when
*NL*
I
say
that
it
means
a
deal
,
Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
time
he
came
and
was
silent
for
a
while
.
Then
he
put
his
head
on
*NL*
one
side
,
and
looked
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
Ben
Gunn
a
man
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
sir
,
''
said
I.
``
I
am
not
very
sure
whether
he
's
sane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
's
any
doubt
about
the
matter
,
he
is
,
''
returned
the
doctor
.
``
A
*NL*
man
who
has
been
three
years
biting
his
nails
on
a
desert
island
,
Jim
,
*NL*
ca
n't
expect
to
appear
as
sane
as
you
or
me
.
It
does
n't
lie
in
human
*NL*
nature
.
Was
it
cheese
you
said
he
had
a
fancy
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
cheese
,
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Jim
,
''
says
he
,
``
just
see
the
good
that
comes
of
being
dainty
in
*NL*
your
food
.
You
've
seen
my
snuff-box
,
have
n't
you
?
And
you
never
saw
me
*NL*
take
snuff
,
the
reason
being
that
in
my
snuff-box
I
carry
a
piece
of
*NL*
Parmesan
cheese
--
a
cheese
made
in
Italy
,
very
nutritious
.
Well
,
that
's
*NL*
for
Ben
Gunn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
supper
was
eaten
we
buried
old
Tom
in
the
sand
and
stood
round
*NL*
him
for
a
while
bare-headed
in
the
breeze
.
A
good
deal
of
firewood
had
*NL*
been
got
in
,
but
not
enough
for
the
captain
's
fancy
,
and
he
shook
his
*NL*
head
over
it
and
told
us
we
``
must
get
back
to
this
tomorrow
rather
*NL*
livelier
.
''
Then
,
when
we
had
eaten
our
pork
and
each
had
a
good
stiff
*NL*
glass
of
brandy
grog
,
the
three
chiefs
got
together
in
a
corner
to
*NL*
discuss
our
prospects
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appears
they
were
at
their
wits
'
end
what
to
do
,
the
stores
being
so
*NL*
low
that
we
must
have
been
starved
into
surrender
long
before
help
came
.
*NL*
But
our
best
hope
,
it
was
decided
,
was
to
kill
off
the
buccaneers
until
*NL*
they
either
hauled
down
their
flag
or
ran
away
with
the
HISPANIOLA
.
From
*NL*
nineteen
they
were
already
reduced
to
fifteen
,
two
others
were
wounded
,
*NL*
and
one
at
least
--
the
man
shot
beside
the
gun
--
severely
wounded
,
if
he
*NL*
were
not
dead
.
Every
time
we
had
a
crack
at
them
,
we
were
to
take
it
,
*NL*
saving
our
own
lives
,
with
the
extremest
care
.
And
besides
that
,
we
had
*NL*
two
able
allies
--
rum
and
the
climate
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
first
,
though
we
were
about
half
a
mile
away
,
we
could
hear
*NL*
them
roaring
and
singing
late
into
the
night
;
and
as
for
the
second
,
*NL*
the
doctor
staked
his
wig
that
,
camped
where
they
were
in
the
marsh
*NL*
and
unprovided
with
remedies
,
the
half
of
them
would
be
on
their
backs
*NL*
before
a
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
he
added
,
``
if
we
are
not
all
shot
down
first
they
'll
be
glad
to
*NL*
be
packing
in
the
schooner
.
It
's
always
a
ship
,
and
they
can
get
to
*NL*
buccaneering
again
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
ship
that
ever
I
lost
,
''
said
Captain
Smollett
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
dead
tired
,
as
you
may
fancy
;
and
when
I
got
to
sleep
,
which
was
*NL*
not
till
after
a
great
deal
of
tossing
,
I
slept
like
a
log
of
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
had
long
been
up
and
had
already
breakfasted
and
increased
the
*NL*
pile
of
firewood
by
about
half
as
much
again
when
I
was
wakened
by
a
*NL*
bustle
and
the
sound
of
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Flag
of
truce
!
''
I
heard
someone
say
;
and
then
,
immediately
after
,
with
*NL*
a
cry
of
surprise
,
``
Silver
himself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
that
,
up
I
jumped
,
and
rubbing
my
eyes
,
ran
to
a
loophole
in
the
*NL*
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
20
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
's
Embassy
*NL*
*NL*
SURE
enough
,
there
were
two
men
just
outside
the
stockade
,
one
of
them
*NL*
waving
a
white
cloth
,
the
other
,
no
less
a
person
than
Silver
himself
,
*NL*
standing
placidly
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
quite
early
,
and
the
coldest
morning
that
I
think
I
ever
*NL*
was
abroad
in
--
a
chill
that
pierced
into
the
marrow
.
The
sky
was
bright
*NL*
and
cloudless
overhead
,
and
the
tops
of
the
trees
shone
rosily
in
*NL*
the
sun
.
But
where
Silver
stood
with
his
lieutenant
,
all
was
still
in
*NL*
shadow
,
and
they
waded
knee-deep
in
a
low
white
vapour
that
had
crawled
*NL*
during
the
night
out
of
the
morass
.
The
chill
and
the
vapour
taken
*NL*
together
told
a
poor
tale
of
the
island
.
It
was
plainly
a
damp
,
*NL*
feverish
,
unhealthy
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
indoors
,
men
,
''
said
the
captain
.
``
Ten
to
one
this
is
a
trick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
hailed
the
buccaneer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
goes
?
Stand
,
or
we
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Flag
of
truce
,
''
cried
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
was
in
the
porch
,
keeping
himself
carefully
out
of
the
way
*NL*
of
a
treacherous
shot
,
should
any
be
intended
.
He
turned
and
spoke
to
*NL*
us
,
``
Doctor
's
watch
on
the
lookout
.
Dr.
Livesey
take
the
north
side
,
*NL*
if
you
please
;
Jim
,
the
east
;
Gray
,
west
.
The
watch
below
,
all
hands
to
*NL*
load
muskets
.
Lively
,
men
,
and
careful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
turned
again
to
the
mutineers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
you
want
with
your
flag
of
truce
?
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
it
was
the
other
man
who
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cap'n
Silver
,
sir
,
to
come
on
board
and
make
terms
,
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cap'n
Silver
!
Do
n't
know
him
.
Who
's
he
?
''
cried
the
captain
.
And
we
*NL*
could
hear
him
adding
to
himself
,
``
Cap'n
,
is
it
?
My
heart
,
and
here
's
*NL*
promotion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Long
John
answered
for
himself
.
``
Me
,
sir
.
These
poor
lads
have
chosen
me
*NL*
cap'n
,
after
your
desertion
,
sir
''
--
laying
a
particular
emphasis
upon
the
*NL*
word
``
desertion
.
''
``
We
're
willing
to
submit
,
if
we
can
come
to
terms
,
*NL*
and
no
bones
about
it
.
All
I
ask
is
your
word
,
Cap'n
Smollett
,
to
let
me
*NL*
safe
and
sound
out
of
this
here
stockade
,
and
one
minute
to
get
out
o
'
*NL*
shot
before
a
gun
is
fired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
man
,
''
said
Captain
Smollett
,
``
I
have
not
the
slightest
desire
to
*NL*
talk
to
you
.
If
you
wish
to
talk
to
me
,
you
can
come
,
that
's
all
.
If
*NL*
there
's
any
treachery
,
it
'll
be
on
your
side
,
and
the
Lord
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
,
cap'n
,
''
shouted
Long
John
cheerily
.
``
A
word
from
you
's
*NL*
enough
.
I
know
a
gentleman
,
and
you
may
lay
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
could
see
the
man
who
carried
the
flag
of
truce
attempting
to
hold
*NL*
Silver
back
.
Nor
was
that
wonderful
,
seeing
how
cavalier
had
been
the
*NL*
captain
's
answer
.
But
Silver
laughed
at
him
aloud
and
slapped
him
on
the
*NL*
back
as
if
the
idea
of
alarm
had
been
absurd
.
Then
he
advanced
to
the
*NL*
stockade
,
threw
over
his
crutch
,
got
a
leg
up
,
and
with
great
vigour
*NL*
and
skill
succeeded
in
surmounting
the
fence
and
dropping
safely
to
the
*NL*
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
confess
that
I
was
far
too
much
taken
up
with
what
was
going
on
*NL*
to
be
of
the
slightest
use
as
sentry
;
indeed
,
I
had
already
deserted
*NL*
my
eastern
loophole
and
crept
up
behind
the
captain
,
who
had
now
seated
*NL*
himself
on
the
threshold
,
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
his
head
in
his
*NL*
hands
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
water
as
it
bubbled
out
of
the
old
iron
*NL*
kettle
in
the
sand
.
He
was
whistling
``
Come
,
Lasses
and
Lads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
had
terrible
hard
work
getting
up
the
knoll
.
What
with
the
*NL*
steepness
of
the
incline
,
the
thick
tree
stumps
,
and
the
soft
sand
,
he
*NL*
and
his
crutch
were
as
helpless
as
a
ship
in
stays
.
But
he
stuck
to
it
*NL*
like
a
man
in
silence
,
and
at
last
arrived
before
the
captain
,
whom
*NL*
he
saluted
in
the
handsomest
style
.
He
was
tricked
out
in
his
best
;
*NL*
an
immense
blue
coat
,
thick
with
brass
buttons
,
hung
as
low
as
to
his
*NL*
knees
,
and
a
fine
laced
hat
was
set
on
the
back
of
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
,
my
man
,
''
said
the
captain
,
raising
his
head
.
``
You
had
*NL*
better
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ai
n't
a-going
to
let
me
inside
,
cap'n
?
''
complained
Long
John
.
``
It
's
*NL*
a
main
cold
morning
,
to
be
sure
,
sir
,
to
sit
outside
upon
the
sand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Silver
,
''
said
the
captain
,
``
if
you
had
pleased
to
be
an
honest
*NL*
man
,
you
might
have
been
sitting
in
your
galley
.
It
's
your
own
doing
.
*NL*
You
're
either
my
ship
's
cook
--
and
then
you
were
treated
handsome
--
or
*NL*
Cap'n
Silver
,
a
common
mutineer
and
pirate
,
and
then
you
can
go
hang
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
cap'n
,
''
returned
the
sea-cook
,
sitting
down
as
he
was
*NL*
bidden
on
the
sand
,
``
you
'll
have
to
give
me
a
hand
up
again
,
that
's
all
.
*NL*
A
sweet
pretty
place
you
have
of
it
here
.
Ah
,
there
's
Jim
!
The
top
of
*NL*
the
morning
to
you
,
Jim
.
Doctor
,
here
's
my
service
.
Why
,
there
you
all
*NL*
are
together
like
a
happy
family
,
in
a
manner
of
speaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
anything
to
say
,
my
man
,
better
say
it
,
''
said
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
you
were
,
Cap'n
Smollett
,
''
replied
Silver
.
``
Dooty
is
dooty
,
to
be
*NL*
sure

Well
now
,
you
look
here
,
that
was
a
good
lay
of
yours
last
*NL*
night

I
do
n't
deny
it
was
a
good
lay

Some
of
you
pretty
handy
with
a
*NL*
handspike-end

And
I
'll
not
deny
neither
but
what
some
of
my
people
was
*NL*
shook
--
maybe
all
was
shook
;
maybe
I
was
shook
myself
;
maybe
that
's
*NL*
why
I
'm
here
for
terms
.
But
you
mark
me
,
cap'n
,
it
wo
n't
do
twice
,
by
*NL*
thunder
!
We
'll
have
to
do
sentry-go
and
ease
off
a
point
or
so
on
the
*NL*
rum
.
Maybe
you
think
we
were
all
a
sheet
in
the
wind
's
eye
.
But
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
I
was
sober
;
I
was
on
'
y
dog
tired
;
and
if
I
'd
awoke
a
second
*NL*
sooner
,
I
'd
'
a
caught
you
at
the
act
,
I
would
.
He
was
n't
dead
when
I
got
*NL*
round
to
him
,
not
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
says
Captain
Smollett
as
cool
as
can
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
Silver
said
was
a
riddle
to
him
,
but
you
would
never
have
*NL*
guessed
it
from
his
tone
.
As
for
me
,
I
began
to
have
an
inkling
.
Ben
*NL*
Gunn
's
last
words
came
back
to
my
mind
.
I
began
to
suppose
that
he
had
*NL*
paid
the
buccaneers
a
visit
while
they
all
lay
drunk
together
round
*NL*
their
fire
,
and
I
reckoned
up
with
glee
that
we
had
only
fourteen
*NL*
enemies
to
deal
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
it
is
,
''
said
Silver
.
``
We
want
that
treasure
,
and
we
'll
have
*NL*
it
--
that
's
our
point
!
You
would
just
as
soon
save
your
lives
,
I
reckon
;
*NL*
and
that
's
yours
.
You
have
a
chart
,
have
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
as
may
be
,
''
replied
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
you
have
,
I
know
that
,
''
returned
Long
John
.
``
You
need
n't
be
*NL*
so
husky
with
a
man
;
there
ai
n't
a
particle
of
service
in
that
,
and
you
*NL*
may
lay
to
it
.
What
I
mean
is
,
we
want
your
chart
.
Now
,
I
never
meant
*NL*
you
no
harm
,
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wo
n't
do
with
me
,
my
man
,
''
interrupted
the
captain
.
``
We
know
*NL*
exactly
what
you
meant
to
do
,
and
we
do
n't
care
,
for
now
,
you
see
,
you
*NL*
ca
n't
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
captain
looked
at
him
calmly
and
proceeded
to
fill
a
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Abe
Gray
--
''
Silver
broke
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Avast
there
!
''
cried
Mr.
Smollett
.
``
Gray
told
me
nothing
,
and
I
asked
*NL*
him
nothing
;
and
what
's
more
,
I
would
see
you
and
him
and
this
whole
*NL*
island
blown
clean
out
of
the
water
into
blazes
first
.
So
there
's
my
*NL*
mind
for
you
,
my
man
,
on
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
whiff
of
temper
seemed
to
cool
Silver
down
.
He
had
been
*NL*
growing
nettled
before
,
but
now
he
pulled
himself
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
enough
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
would
set
no
limits
to
what
gentlemen
might
*NL*
consider
shipshape
,
or
might
not
,
as
the
case
were
.
And
seein
'
as
how
*NL*
you
are
about
to
take
a
pipe
,
cap'n
,
I
'll
make
so
free
as
do
likewise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
filled
a
pipe
and
lighted
it
;
and
the
two
men
sat
silently
*NL*
smoking
for
quite
a
while
,
now
looking
each
other
in
the
face
,
now
*NL*
stopping
their
tobacco
,
now
leaning
forward
to
spit
.
It
was
as
good
as
*NL*
the
play
to
see
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
resumed
Silver
,
``
here
it
is
.
You
give
us
the
chart
to
get
the
*NL*
treasure
by
,
and
drop
shooting
poor
seamen
and
stoving
of
their
heads
in
*NL*
while
asleep
.
You
do
that
,
and
we
'll
offer
you
a
choice
.
Either
you
come
*NL*
aboard
along
of
us
,
once
the
treasure
shipped
,
and
then
I
'll
give
you
my
*NL*
affy-davy
,
upon
my
word
of
honour
,
to
clap
you
somewhere
safe
ashore
.
Or
*NL*
if
that
ai
n't
to
your
fancy
,
some
of
my
hands
being
rough
and
having
*NL*
old
scores
on
account
of
hazing
,
then
you
can
stay
here
,
you
can
.
We
'll
*NL*
divide
stores
with
you
,
man
for

;
and
I
'll
give
my
affy-davy
,
as
*NL*
before
to
speak
the
first

sight

and
send
'em
here
to
pick
you

up

Now
,
you
'll
own
that
's
talking
.
Handsomer
you
could
n't
look
to
get
,

now
you

And
I
hope

--
raising
his
voice
--
``
that
all
hands
in
this

block
house

overhaul
my
words
,
for
what

spoke
to
*NL*
all

''
*NL*
*NL*
Captain
Smollett
rose
from
his
seat
and
knocked
out
the
ashes
of
his
*NL*
pipe
in
the
palm
of
his
left
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
last
word
,
by

''
answered
John
.
``
Refuse
that
,
and
you
've
*NL*
seen
the
last
of
me
but
musket-balls

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
the
captain
.
``
Now
you
'll
hear
me

If
you
'll
come
up
*NL*
one

unarmed

I
'll
engage
to
clap
you
all
in

take
you

home

out

and
double
*NL*
quick

''
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
's
face
was
a
picture
;
his
eyes
started
in
his
head
with
wrath
.
He
*NL*
shook
the
fire
out
of
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
a
hand
up
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I
,
''
returned
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
'll
give
me
a
hand
up
?
''
he
roared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
man
among
us
moved
.
Growling
the
foulest
imprecations
,
he
crawled
*NL*
along
the
sand
till
he
got
hold
of
the
porch
and
could
hoist
himself
*NL*
again
upon
his
crutch
.
Then
he
spat
into
the
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
he
cried
.
``
That
's
what
I
think
of
ye
.
Before
an
hour
's
out

*NL*
I
'll
stove

Them
that
die
'll
be
the
lucky
ones

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
dreadful
oath
he
stumbled
off
,
ploughed
down
the
sand
,
was
*NL*
helped
across
the
stockade
,
after
four
or
five
failures
,
by
the
man
with
*NL*
the
flag
of
truce
,
and
disappeared
in
an
instant
afterwards
among
the
*NL*
trees

*NL*
*NL*
The
Attack
*NL*
*NL*
AS
soon
as
Silver
disappeared
,
the
captain
,
who
had
been
closely
*NL*
watching
him
,
turned
towards
the
interior
of
the
house
and
found
not
a
*NL*
man
of
us
at
his
post
but
Gray
.
It
was
the
first
time
we
had
ever
seen
*NL*
him
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quarters
!
''
he
roared
.
And
then
,
as
we
all
slunk
back
to
our
places
,
*NL*
``
Gray
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'll
put
your
name
in
the
log
;
you
've
stood
by
your
*NL*
duty
like
a
seaman
.
Mr.
Trelawney
,
I
'm
surprised
at
you
,
sir
.
Doctor
,
*NL*
I
thought
you
had
worn
the
king
's
coat
!
If
that
was
how
you
served
at
*NL*
Fontenoy
,
sir
,
you
'd
have
been
better
in
your
berth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
's
watch
were
all
back
at
their
loopholes
,
the
rest
were
busy
*NL*
loading
the
spare
muskets
,
and
everyone
with
a
red
face
,
you
may
be
*NL*
certain
,
and
a
flea
in
his
ear
,
as
the
saying
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
looked
on
for
a
while
in
silence
.
Then
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lads
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
've
given
Silver
a
broadside
.
I
pitched
it
in
*NL*
red-hot
on
purpose
;
and
before
the
hour
's
out
,
as
he
said
,
we
shall
be
*NL*
boarded
.
We
're
outnumbered
,
I
need
n't
tell
you
that
,
but
we
fight
in
*NL*
shelter
;
and
a
minute
ago
I
should
have
said
we
fought
with
discipline
.
*NL*
I
've
no
manner
of
doubt
that
we
can
drub
them
,
if
you
choose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
the
rounds
and
saw
,
as
he
said
,
that
all
was
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
two
short
sides
of
the
house
,
east
and
west
,
there
were
only
two
*NL*
loopholes
;
on
the
south
side
where
the
porch
was
,
two
again
;
and
on
the
*NL*
north
side
,
five
.
There
was
a
round
score
of
muskets
for
the
seven
*NL*
of
us
;
the
firewood
had
been
built
into
four
piles
--
tables
,
you
might
*NL*
say
--
one
about
the
middle
of
each
side
,
and
on
each
of
these
tables
some
*NL*
ammunition
and
four
loaded
muskets
were
laid
ready
to
the
hand
of
the
*NL*
defenders
.
In
the
middle
,
the
cutlasses
lay
ranged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Toss
out
the
fire
,
''
said
the
captain
;
``
the
chill
is
past
,
and
we
*NL*
must
n't
have
smoke
in
our
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
iron
fire-basket
was
carried
bodily
out
by
Mr.
Trelawney
,
and
the
*NL*
embers
smothered
among
sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hawkins
has
n't
had
his
breakfast
.
Hawkins
,
help
yourself
,
and
back
to
*NL*
your
post
to
eat
it
,
''
continued
Captain
Smollett
.
``
Lively
,
now
,
my
lad
;
*NL*
you
'll
want
it
before
you
've
done
.
Hunter
,

out
a
round
of
brandy
*NL*
to
all
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
this
was
going
on
,
the
captain
completed
,
in
his
own
mind
,
the
*NL*
plan
of
the
defence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
you
will
take
the
door
,
''
he
resumed
.
``
See
,
and
do
n't
expose
*NL*
yourself
;
keep
within
,
and
fire
through
the
porch
.
Hunter
,
take
the
east
*NL*
side
,
there
.
Joyce
,
you
stand
by
the
west
,
my
man
.
Mr.
Trelawney
,
you
*NL*
are
the
best
shot
--
you
and
Gray
will
take
this
long
north
side
,
with
the
*NL*
five
loopholes
;
it
's
there
the
danger
is
.
If
they
can
get
up
to
it
and
*NL*
fire
in
upon
us
through
our
own
ports
,
things
would
begin
to
look
dirty
.
*NL*
Hawkins
,
neither
you
nor
I
are
much
account
at
the
shooting
;
we
'll
stand
*NL*
by
to
load
and
bear
a
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
captain
had
said
,
the
chill
was
past
.
As
soon
as
the
sun
had
*NL*
climbed
above
our
girdle
of
trees
,
it
fell
with
all
its
force
upon
the
*NL*
clearing
and
drank
up
the
vapours
at
a
draught
.
Soon
the
sand
was
baking
*NL*
and
the
resin
melting
in
the
logs
of
the
block
house
.
Jackets
and
coats
*NL*
were
flung
aside
,
shirts
thrown
open
at
the
neck
and
rolled
up
to
the
*NL*
shoulders
;
and
we
stood
there
,
each
at
his
post
,
in
a
fever
of
heat
and
*NL*
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
passed
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
them
!
''
said
the
captain
.
``
This
is
as
dull
as
the
doldrums
.
Gray
,
*NL*
whistle
for
a
wind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
just
at
that
moment
came
the
first
news
of
the
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
please
,
sir
,
''
said
Joyce
,
``
if
I
see
anyone
,
am
I
to
fire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
so
!
''
cried
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
returned
Joyce
with
the
same
quiet
civility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
followed
for
a
time
,
but
the
remark
had
set
us
all
on
the
alert
,
*NL*
straining
ears
and
eyes
--
the
musketeers
with
their
pieces
balanced
in
*NL*
their
hands
,
the
captain
out
in
the
middle
of
the
block
house
with
his
*NL*
mouth
very
tight
and
a
frown
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
some
seconds
passed
,
till
suddenly
Joyce
whipped
up
his
musket
*NL*
and
fired
.
The
report
had
scarcely
died
away
ere
it
was
repeated
and
*NL*
repeated
from
without
in
a
scattering
volley
,
shot
behind
shot
,
like
*NL*
a
string
of
geese
,
from
every
side
of
the
enclosure
.
Several
bullets
*NL*
struck
the
log-house
,
but
not
one
entered
;
and
as
the
smoke
cleared
away
*NL*
and
vanished
,
the
stockade
and
the
woods
around
it
looked
as
quiet
and
*NL*
empty
as
before
.
Not
a
bough
waved
,
not
the
gleam
of
a
musket-barrel
*NL*
betrayed
the
presence
of
our
foes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hit
your
man
?
''
asked
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
,
''
replied
Joyce
.
``
I
believe
not
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
best
thing
to
tell
the
truth
,
''
muttered
Captain
Smollett
.
``
Load
*NL*
his
gun
,
Hawkins
.
How
many
should
say
there
were
on
your
side
,
doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
precisely
,
''
said
Dr.
Livesey
.
``
Three
shots
were
fired
on
this
*NL*
side
.
I
saw
the
three
flashes
--
two
close
together
--
one
farther
to
the
*NL*
west
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
!
''
repeated
the
captain
.
``
And
how
many
on
yours
,
Mr.
Trelawney
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
not
so
easily
answered
.
There
had
come
many
from
the
*NL*
north
--
seven
by
the
squire
's
computation
,
eight
or
nine
according
to
*NL*
Gray
.
From
the
east
and
west
only
a
single
shot
had
been
fired
.
It
was
*NL*
plain
,
therefore
,
that
the
attack
would
be
developed
from
the
north
and
*NL*
that
on
the
other
three
sides
we
were
only
to
be
annoyed
by
a
show
of
*NL*
hostilities
.
But
Captain
Smollett
made
no
change
in
his
arrangements
.
If
*NL*
the
mutineers
succeeded
in
crossing
the
stockade
,
he
argued
,
they
would
*NL*
take
possession
of
any
unprotected
loophole
and
shoot
us
down
like
rats
*NL*
in
our
own
stronghold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
had
we
much
time
left
to
us
for
thought
.
Suddenly
,
with
a
loud
*NL*
huzza
,
a
little
cloud
of
pirates
leaped
from
the
woods
on
the
north
side
*NL*
and
ran
straight
on
the
stockade
.
At
the
same
moment
,
the
fire
was
once
*NL*
more
opened
from
the
woods
,
and
a
rifle
ball
sang
through
the
doorway
*NL*
and
knocked
the
doctor
's
musket
into
bits
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boarders
swarmed
over
the
fence
like
monkeys
.
Squire
and
Gray
fired
*NL*
again
and
yet
again
;
three
men
fell
,
one
forwards
into
the
enclosure
,
*NL*
two
back
on
the
outside
.
But
of
these
,
one
was
evidently
more
frightened
*NL*
than
hurt
,
for
he
was
on
his
feet
again
in
a
crack
and
instantly
*NL*
disappeared
among
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
had
bit
the
dust
,
one
had
fled
,
four
had
made
good
their
footing
*NL*
inside
our
defences
,
while
from
the
shelter
of
the
woods
seven
or
eight
*NL*
men
,
each
evidently
supplied
with
several
muskets
,
kept
up
a
hot
though
*NL*
useless
fire
on
the
log-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
who
had
boarded
made
straight
before
them
for
the
building
,
*NL*
shouting
as
they
ran
,
and
the
men
among
the
trees
shouted
back
to
*NL*
encourage
them
.
Several
shots
were
fired
,
but
such
was
the
hurry
of
the
*NL*
marksmen
that
not
one
appears
to
have
taken
effect
.
In
a
moment
,
the
*NL*
four
pirates
had
swarmed
up
the
mound
and
were
upon
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
head
of
Job
Anderson
,
the
boatswain
,
appeared
at
the
middle
*NL*
loophole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
'em
,
all
hands
--
all
hands
!
''
he
roared
in
a
voice
of
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
,
another
pirate
grasped
Hunter
's
musket
by
the
*NL*
muzzle
,
wrenched
it
from
his
hands
,
plucked
it
through
the
loophole
,
*NL*
and
with
one
stunning
blow
,
laid
the
poor
fellow
senseless
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
a
third
,
running
unharmed
all
around
the
house
,
appeared
*NL*
suddenly
in
the
doorway
and
fell
with
his
cutlass
on
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
position
was
utterly
reversed
.
A
moment
since
we
were
firing
,
under
*NL*
cover
,
at
an
exposed
enemy
;
now
it
was
we
who
lay
uncovered
and
could
*NL*
not
return
a
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
log-house
was
full
of
smoke
,
to
which
we
owed
our
comparative
*NL*
safety
.
Cries
and
confusion
,
the
flashes
and
reports
of
pistol-shots
,
*NL*
and
one
loud
groan
rang
in
my
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Out
,
lads
,
out
,
and
fight
'em
in
the
open
!
Cutlasses
!
''
cried
the
*NL*
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
snatched
a
cutlass
from
the
pile
,
and
someone
,
at
the
same
time
*NL*
snatching
another
,
gave
me
a
cut
across
the
knuckles
which
I
hardly
*NL*
felt
.
I
dashed
out
of
the
door
into
the
clear
sunlight
.
Someone
was
*NL*
close
behind
,
I
knew
not
whom
.
Right
in
front
,
the
doctor
was
pursuing
*NL*
his
assailant
down
the
hill
,
and
just
as
my
eyes
fell
upon
him
,
beat
*NL*
down
his
guard
and
sent
him
sprawling
on
his
back
with
a
great
slash
*NL*
across
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Round
the
house
,
lads
!
Round
the
house
!
''
cried
the
captain
;
and
even
in
*NL*
the
hurly-burly
,
I
perceived
a
change
in
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mechanically
,
I
obeyed
,
turned
eastwards
,
and
with
my
cutlass
raised
,
*NL*
ran
round
the
corner
of
the
house
.
Next
moment
I
was
face
to
face
*NL*
with
Anderson
.
He
roared
aloud
,
and
his
hanger
went
up
above
his
head
,
*NL*
flashing
in
the
sunlight
.
I
had
not
time
to
be
afraid
,
but
as
the
blow
*NL*
still
hung
impending
,
leaped
in
a
trice
upon
one
side
,
and
missing
my
*NL*
foot
in
the
soft
sand
,
rolled
headlong
down
the
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
had
first
sallied
from
the
door
,
the
other
mutineers
had
been
*NL*
already
swarming
up
the
palisade
to
make
an
end
of
us
.
One
man
,
in
a
red
*NL*
night-cap
,
with
his
cutlass
in
his
mouth
,
had
even
got
upon
the
top
and
*NL*
thrown
a
leg
across
.
Well
,
so
short
had
been
the
interval
that
when
I
*NL*
found
my
feet
again
all
was
in
the
same
posture
,
the
fellow
with
the
red
*NL*
night-cap
still
half-way
over
,
another
still
just
showing
his
head
above
*NL*
the
top
of
the
stockade
.
And
yet
,
in
this
breath
of
time
,
the
fight
was
*NL*
over
and
the
victory
was
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gray
,
following
close
behind
me
,
had
cut
down
the
big
boatswain
ere
*NL*
he
had
time
to
recover
from
his
last
blow
.
Another
had
been
shot
at
a
*NL*
loophole
in
the
very
act
of
firing
into
the
house
and
now
lay
in
agony
,
*NL*
the
pistol
still
smoking
in
his
hand
.
A
third
,
as
I
had
seen
,
the
doctor
*NL*
had
disposed
of
at
a
blow
.
Of
the
four
who
had
scaled
the
palisade
,
one
*NL*
only
remained
unaccounted
for
,
and
he
,
having
left
his
cutlass
on
the
*NL*
field
,
was
now
clambering
out
again
with
the
fear
of
death
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fire
--
fire
from
the
house
!
''
cried
the
doctor
.
``
And
you
,
lads
,
back
into
*NL*
cover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
his
words
were
unheeded
,
no
shot
was
fired
,
and
the
last
boarder
*NL*
made
good
his
escape
and
disappeared
with
the
rest
into
the
wood
.
In
*NL*
three
seconds
nothing
remained
of
the
attacking
party
but
the
five
who
*NL*
had
fallen
,
four
on
the
inside
and
one
on
the
outside
of
the
palisade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
and
Gray
and
I
ran
full
speed
for
shelter
.
The
survivors
*NL*
would
soon
be
back
where
they
had
left
their
muskets
,
and
at
any
moment
*NL*
the
fire
might
recommence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
was
by
this
time
somewhat
cleared
of
smoke
,
and
we
saw
at
*NL*
a
glance
the
price
we
had
paid
for
victory
.
Hunter
lay
beside
his
*NL*
loophole
,
stunned
;
Joyce
by
his
,
shot
through
the
head
,
never
to
move
*NL*
again
;
while
right
in
the
centre
,
the
squire
was
supporting
the
captain
,
*NL*
one
as
pale
as
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
captain
's
wounded
,
''
said
Mr.
Trelawney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
they
run
?
''
asked
Mr.
Smollett
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
could
,
you
may
be
bound
,
''
returned
the
doctor
;
``
but
there
's
*NL*
five
of
them
will
never
run
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
!
''
cried
the
captain
.
``
Come
,
that
's
better
.
Five
against
three
*NL*
leaves
us
four
to
nine
.
That
's
better
odds
than
we
had
at
starting
.
We
*NL*
were
seven
to
nineteen
then
,
or
thought
we
were
,
and
that
's
as
bad
to
*NL*
bear
.
''
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
mutineers
were
soon
only
eight
in
number
,
for
the
man
shot
by
Mr.
*NL*
Trelawney
on
board
the
schooner
died
that
same
evening
of
his
wound
.
But
*NL*
this
was
,
of
course
,
not
known
till
after
by
the
faithful
party
.

My

Adventure

*NL*

22
*NL*
*NL*
How
My
Sea
Adventure
Began
*NL*
*NL*
THERE
was
no
return
of
the
mutineers
--
not
so
much
as
another
shot
out
of
*NL*
the
woods
.
They
had
``
got
their
rations
for
that
day
,
''
as
the
captain
put
*NL*
it
,
and
we
had
the
place
to
ourselves
and
a
quiet
time
to
overhaul
the
*NL*
wounded
and
get
dinner
.
Squire
and
I
cooked
outside
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
danger
,
and
even
outside
we
could
hardly
tell
what
we
were
at
,
for
*NL*
horror
of
the
loud
groans
that
reached
us
from
the
doctor
's
patients
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
the
eight
men
who
had
fallen
in
the
action
,
only
three
still
*NL*
breathed
--
that
one
of
the
pirates
who
had
been
shot
at
the
loophole
,
*NL*
Hunter
,
and
Captain
Smollett
;
and
of
these
,
the
first
two
were
as
good
*NL*
as
dead
;
the
mutineer
indeed
died
under
the
doctor
's
knife
,
and
Hunter
,
*NL*
do
what
we
could
,
never
recovered
consciousness
in
this
world
.
He
*NL*
lingered
all
day
,
breathing
loudly
like
the
old
buccaneer
at
home
in
his
*NL*
apoplectic
fit
,
but
the
bones
of
his
chest
had
been
crushed
by
the
*NL*
blow
and
his
skull
fractured
in
falling
,
and
some
time
in
the
following
*NL*
night
,
without
sign
or
sound
,
he
went
to
his
Maker
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
captain
,
his
wounds
were
grievous
indeed
,
but
not
dangerous
.
*NL*
No
organ
was
fatally
injured
.
Anderson
's
ball
--
for
it
was
Job
that
*NL*
shot
him
first
--
had
broken
his
shoulder-blade
and
touched
the
lung
,
not
*NL*
badly
;
the
second
had
only
torn
and
displaced
some
muscles
in
the
calf
.
*NL*
He
was
sure
to
recover
,
the
doctor
said
,
but
in
the
meantime
,
and
for
*NL*
weeks
to
come
,
he
must
not
walk
nor
move
his
arm
,
nor
so
much
as
speak
*NL*
when
he
could
help
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
own
accidental
cut
across
the
knuckles
was
a
flea-bite
.
Doctor
*NL*
Livesey
patched
it
up
with
plaster
and
pulled
my
ears
for
me
into
the
*NL*
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
the
squire
and
the
doctor
sat
by
the
captain
's
side
awhile
*NL*
in
consultation
;
and
when
they
had
talked
to
their
hearts
'
content
,
it
*NL*
being
then
a
little
past
noon
,
the
doctor
took
up
his
hat
and
pistols
,
*NL*
girt
on
a
cutlass
,
put
the
chart
in
his
pocket
,
and
with
a
musket
over
*NL*
his
shoulder
crossed
the
palisade
on
the
north
side
and
set
off
briskly
*NL*
through
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gray
and
I
were
sitting
together
at
the
far
end
of
the
block
house
,
to
*NL*
be
out
of
earshot
of
our
officers
consulting
;
and
Gray
took
his
pipe
out
*NL*
of
his
mouth
and
fairly
forgot
to
put
it
back
again
,
so
thunder-struck
*NL*
he
was
at
this
occurrence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
in
the
name
of
Davy
Jones
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
Dr.
Livesey
mad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
no
,
''
says
I.
``
He
's
about
the
last
of
this
crew
for
that
,
I
take
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
shipmate
,
''
said
Gray
,
``
mad
he
may
not
be
;
but
if
HE
'S
not
,
you
*NL*
mark
my
words
,
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
take
it
,
''
replied
I
,
``
the
doctor
has
his
idea
;
and
if
I
am
right
,
*NL*
he
's
going
now
to
see
Ben
Gunn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
right
,
as
appeared
later
;
but
in
the
meantime
,
the
house
being
*NL*
stifling
hot
and
the
little
patch
of
sand
inside
the
palisade
ablaze
*NL*
with
midday
sun
,
I
began
to
get
another
thought
into
my
head
,
which
was
*NL*
not
by
any
means
so
right
.
What
I
began
to
do
was
to
envy
the
doctor
*NL*
walking
in
the
cool
shadow
of
the
woods
with
the
birds
about
him
and
the
*NL*
pleasant
smell
of
the
pines
,
while
I
sat
grilling
,
with
my
clothes
*NL*
stuck
to
the
hot
resin
,
and
so
much
blood
about
me
and
so
many
poor
*NL*
dead
bodies
lying
all
around
that
I
took
a
disgust
of
the
place
that
was
*NL*
almost
as
strong
as
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
time
I
was
washing
out
the
block
house
,
and
then
washing
up
*NL*
the
things
from
dinner
,
this
disgust
and
envy
kept
growing
stronger
*NL*
and
stronger
,
till
at
last
,
being
near
a
bread-bag
,
and
no
one
then
*NL*
observing
me
,
I
took
the
first
step
towards
my
escapade
and
filled
both
*NL*
pockets
of
my
coat
with
biscuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
a
fool
,
if
you
like
,
and
certainly
I
was
going
to
do
a
foolish
,
*NL*
over-bold
act
;
but
I
was
determined
to
do
it
with
all
the
precautions
in
*NL*
my
power
.
These
biscuits
,
should
anything
befall
me
,
would
keep
me
,
at
*NL*
least
,
from
starving
till
far
on
in
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
thing
I
laid
hold
of
was
a
brace
of
pistols
,
and
as
I
already
*NL*
had
a
powder-horn
and
bullets
,
I
felt
myself
well
supplied
with
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
scheme
I
had
in
my
head
,
it
was
not
a
bad
one
in
itself
.
I
*NL*
was
to
go
down
the
sandy
spit
that
divides
the
anchorage
on
the
east
*NL*
from
the
open
sea
,
find
the
white
rock
I
had
observed
last
evening
,
and
*NL*
ascertain
whether
it
was
there
or
not
that
Ben
Gunn
had
hidden
his
boat
,
*NL*
a
thing
quite
worth
doing
,
as
I
still
believe
.
But
as
I
was
certain
I
*NL*
should
not
be
allowed
to
leave
the
enclosure
,
my
only
plan
was
to
take
*NL*
French
leave
and
slip
out
when
nobody
was
watching
,
and
that
was
so
bad
*NL*
a
way
of
doing
it
as
made
the
thing
itself
wrong
.
But
I
was
only
a
boy
,
*NL*
and
I
had
made
my
mind
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
as
things
at
last
fell
out
,
I
found
an
admirable
opportunity
.
The
*NL*
squire
and
Gray
were
busy
helping
the
captain
with
his
bandages
,
the
*NL*
coast
was
clear
,
I
made
a
bolt
for
it
over
the
stockade
and
into
the
*NL*
thickest
of
the
trees
,
and
before
my
absence
was
observed
I
was
out
of
*NL*
cry
of
my
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
my
second
folly
,
far
worse
than
the
first
,
as
I
left
but
two
*NL*
sound
men
to
guard
the
house
;
but
like
the
first
,
it
was
a
help
towards
*NL*
saving
all
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
my
way
straight
for
the
east
coast
of
the
island
,
for
I
was
*NL*
determined
to
go
down
the
sea
side
of
the
spit
to
avoid
all
chance
of
*NL*
observation
from
the
anchorage
.
It
was
already
late
in
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
although
still
warm
and
sunny
.
As
I
continued
to
thread
the
tall
woods
,
*NL*
I
could
hear
from
far
before
me
not
only
the
continuous
thunder
of
the
*NL*
surf
,
but
a
certain
tossing
of
foliage
and
grinding
of
boughs
which
*NL*
showed
me
the
sea
breeze
had
set
in
higher
than
usual
.
Soon
cool
*NL*
draughts
of
air
began
to
reach
me
,
and
a
few
steps
farther
I
came
forth
*NL*
into
the
open
borders
of
the
grove
,
and
saw
the
sea
lying
blue
and
sunny
*NL*
to
the
horizon
and
the
surf
tumbling
and
tossing
its
foam
along
the
*NL*
beach
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
never
seen
the
sea
quiet
round
Treasure
Island
.
The
sun
might
*NL*
blaze
overhead
,
the
air
be
without
a
breath
,
the
surface
smooth
and
*NL*
blue
,
but
still
these
great
rollers
would
be
running
along
all
the
*NL*
external
coast
,
thundering
and
thundering
by
day
and
night
;
and
I
scarce
*NL*
believe
there
is
one
spot
in
the
island
where
a
man
would
be
out
of
*NL*
earshot
of
their
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
along
beside
the
surf
with
great
enjoyment
,
till
,
thinking
*NL*
I
was
now
got
far
enough
to
the
south
,
I
took
the
cover
of
some
thick
*NL*
bushes
and
crept
warily
up
to
the
ridge
of
the
spit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
me
was
the
sea
,
in
front
the
anchorage
.
The
sea
breeze
,
as
though
*NL*
it
had
the
sooner
blown
itself
out
by
its
unusual
violence
,
was
already
*NL*
at
an
end
;
it
had
been
succeeded
by
light
,
variable
airs
from
the
south
*NL*
and
south-east
,
carrying
great
banks
of
fog
;
and
the
anchorage
,
under
*NL*
lee
of
Skeleton
Island
,
lay
still
and
leaden
as
when
first
we
entered
*NL*
it
.
The
HISPANIOLA
,
in
that
unbroken
mirror
,
was
exactly
portrayed
from
*NL*
the
truck
to
the
waterline
,
the
Jolly
Roger
hanging
from
her
peak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alongside
lay
one
of
the
gigs
,
Silver
in
the
stern-sheets
--
him
I
could
*NL*
always
recognize
--
while
a
couple
of
men
were
leaning
over
the
stern
*NL*
bulwarks
,
one
of
them
with
a
red
cap
--
the
very
rogue
that
I
had
seen
*NL*
some
hours
before
stride-legs
upon
the
palisade
.
Apparently
they
were
*NL*
talking
and
laughing
,
though
at
that
distance
--
upwards
of
a
mile
--
I
*NL*
could
,
of
course
,
hear
no
word
of
what
was
said
.
All
at
once
there
began
*NL*
the
most
horrid
,
unearthly
screaming
,
which
at
first
startled
me
badly
,
*NL*
though
I
had
soon
remembered
the
voice
of
Captain
Flint
and
even
thought
*NL*
I
could
make
out
the
bird
by
her
bright
plumage
as
she
sat
perched
upon
*NL*
her
master
's
wrist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
after
,
the
jolly-boat
shoved
off
and
pulled
for
shore
,
and
the
man
*NL*
with
the
red
cap
and
his
comrade
went
below
by
the
cabin
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
about
the
same
time
,
the
sun
had
gone
down
behind
the
Spy-glass
,
*NL*
and
as
the
fog
was
collecting
rapidly
,
it
began
to
grow
dark
in
earnest
.
*NL*
I
saw
I
must
lose
no
time
if
I
were
to
find
the
boat
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
white
rock
,
visible
enough
above
the
brush
,
was
still
some
eighth
of
*NL*
a
mile
further
down
the
spit
,
and
it
took
me
a
goodish
while
to
get
up
*NL*
with
it
,
crawling
,
often
on
all
fours
,
among
the
scrub
.
Night
had
almost
*NL*
come
when
I
laid
my
hand
on
its
rough
sides
.
Right
below
it
there
was
*NL*
an
exceedingly
small
hollow
of
green
turf
,
hidden
by
banks
and
a
thick
*NL*
underwood
about
knee-deep
,
that
grew
there
very
plentifully
;
and
in
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
dell
,
sure
enough
,
a
little
tent
of
goat-skins
,
like
what
*NL*
the
gipsies
carry
about
with
them
in
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dropped
into
the
hollow
,
lifted
the
side
of
the
tent
,
and
there
was
*NL*
Ben
Gunn
's
boat
--
home-made
if
ever
anything
was
home-made
;
a
rude
,
*NL*
lop-sided
framework
of
tough
wood
,
and
stretched
upon
that
a
covering
of
*NL*
goat-skin
,
with
the
hair
inside
.
The
thing
was
extremely
small
,
even
*NL*
for
me
,
and
I
can
hardly
imagine
that
it
could
have
floated
with
a
*NL*
full-sized
man
.
There
was
one
thwart
set
as
low
as
possible
,
a
kind
of
*NL*
stretcher
in
the
bows
,
and
a
double
paddle
for
propulsion
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
not
then
seen
a
coracle
,
such
as
the
ancient
Britons
made
,
but
*NL*
I
have
seen
one
since
,
and
I
can
give
you
no
fairer
idea
of
Ben
Gunn
's
*NL*
boat
than
by
saying
it
was
like
the
first
and
the
worst
coracle
ever
*NL*
made
by
man
.
But
the
great
advantage
of
the
coracle
it
certainly
*NL*
possessed
,
for
it
was
exceedingly
light
and
portable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
now
that
I
had
found
the
boat
,
you
would
have
thought
I
had
had
*NL*
enough
of
truantry
for
once
,
but
in
the
meantime
I
had
taken
another
*NL*
notion
and
become
so
obstinately
fond
of
it
that
I
would
have
carried
*NL*
it
out
,
I
believe
,
in
the
teeth
of
Captain
Smollett
himself
.
This
was
*NL*
to
slip
out
under
cover
of
the
night
,
cut
the
HISPANIOLA
adrift
,
and
let
*NL*
her
go
ashore
where
she
fancied
.
I
had
quite
made
up
my
mind
that
the
*NL*
mutineers
,
after
their
repulse
of
the
morning
,
had
nothing
nearer
their
*NL*
hearts
than
to
up
anchor
and
away
to
sea
;
this
,
I
thought
,
it
would
be
*NL*
a
fine
thing
to
prevent
,
and
now
that
I
had
seen
how
they
left
their
*NL*
watchmen
unprovided
with
a
boat
,
I
thought
it
might
be
done
with
little
*NL*
risk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down
I
sat
to
wait
for
darkness
,
and
made
a
hearty
meal
of
biscuit
.
It
*NL*
was
a
night
out
of
ten
thousand
for
my
purpose
.
The
fog
had
now
buried
*NL*
all
heaven
.
As
the
last
rays
of
daylight
dwindled
and
disappeared
,
*NL*
absolute
blackness
settled
down
on
Treasure
Island
.
And
when
,
at
last
,
*NL*
I
shouldered
the
coracle
and
groped
my
way
stumblingly
out
of
the
hollow
*NL*
where
I
had
supped
,
there
were
but
two
points
visible
on
the
whole
*NL*
anchorage
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
was
the
great
fire
on
shore
,
by
which
the
defeated
pirates
lay
*NL*
carousing
in
the
swamp
.
The
other
,
a
mere
blur
of
light
upon
the
*NL*
darkness
,
indicated
the
position
of
the
anchored
ship
.
She
had
swung
*NL*
round
to
the
ebb
--
her
bow
was
now
towards
me
--
the
only
lights
on
board
*NL*
were
in
the
cabin
,
and
what
I
saw
was
merely
a
reflection
on
the
fog
of
*NL*
the
strong
rays
that
flowed
from
the
stern
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ebb
had
already
run
some
time
,
and
I
had
to
wade
through
a
long
belt
*NL*
of
swampy
sand
,
where
I
sank
several
times
above
the
ankle
,
before
I
*NL*
came
to
the
edge
of
the
retreating
water
,
and
wading
a
little
way
in
,
*NL*
with
some
strength
and
dexterity
,
set
my
coracle
,
keel
downwards
,
on
the
*NL*
surface
.
*NL*
*NL*

The
Ebb-tide
Runs
*NL*
*NL*
THE
coracle
--
as
I
had
ample
reason
to
know
before
I
was
done
with
*NL*
her
--
was
a
very
safe
boat
for
a
person
of
my
height
and
weight
,
both
*NL*
buoyant
and
clever
in
a
seaway
;
but
she
was
the
most
cross-grained
,
*NL*
lop-sided
craft
to
manage
.
Do
as
you
pleased
,
she
always
made
more
*NL*
leeway
than
anything
else
,
and
turning
round
and
round
was
the
manoeuvre
*NL*
she
was
best
at
.
Even
Ben
Gunn
himself
has
admitted
that
she
was
``
queer
*NL*
to
handle
till
you
knew
her
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
I
did
not
know
her
way
.
She
turned
in
every
direction
but
the
*NL*
one
I
was
bound
to
go
;
the
most
part
of
the
time
we
were
broadside
on
,
*NL*
and
I
am
very
sure
I
never
should
have
made
the
ship
at
all
but
for
the
*NL*
tide
.
By
good
fortune
,
paddle
as
I
pleased
,
the
tide
was
still
sweeping
*NL*
me
down
;
and
there
lay
the
HISPANIOLA
right
in
the
fairway
,
hardly
to
be
*NL*
missed
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
she
loomed
before
me
like
a
blot
of
something
yet
blacker
than
*NL*
darkness
,
then
her
spars
and
hull
began
to
take
shape
,
and
the
next
*NL*
moment
,
as
it
seemed
-LRB-
for
,
the
farther
I
went
,
the
brisker
grew
the
*NL*
current
of
the
ebb
-RRB-
,
I
was
alongside
of
her
hawser
and
had
laid
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hawser
was
as
taut
as
a
bowstring
,
and
the
current
so
strong
she
*NL*
pulled
upon
her
anchor
.
All
round
the
hull
,
in
the
blackness
,
the
*NL*
rippling
current
bubbled
and
chattered
like
a
little
mountain
stream
.
*NL*
One
cut
with
my
sea-gully
and
the
HISPANIOLA
would
go
humming
down
the
*NL*
tide
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
so
good
,
but
it
next
occurred
to
my
recollection
that
a
taut
*NL*
hawser
,
suddenly
cut
,
is
a
thing
as
dangerous
as
a
kicking
horse
.
Ten
to
*NL*
one
,
if
I
were
so
foolhardy
as
to
cut
the
HISPANIOLA
from
her
anchor
,
I
*NL*
and
the
coracle
would
be
knocked
clean
out
of
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
brought
me
to
a
full
stop
,
and
if
fortune
had
not
again
*NL*
particularly
favoured
me
,
I
should
have
had
to
abandon
my
design
.
But
*NL*
the
light
airs
which
had
begun
blowing
from
the
south-east
and
south
*NL*
had
hauled
round
after
nightfall
into
the
south-west
.
Just
while
I
was
*NL*
meditating
,
a
puff
came
,
caught
the
HISPANIOLA
,
and
forced
her
up
into
*NL*
the
current
;
and
to
my
great
joy
,
I
felt
the
hawser
slacken
in
my
grasp
,
*NL*
and
the
hand
by
which
I
held
it
dip
for
a
second
under
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
I
made
my
mind
up
,
took
out
my
gully
,
opened
it
with
my
teeth
,
*NL*
and
cut
one
strand
after
another
,
till
the
vessel
swung
only
by
two
.
*NL*
Then
I
lay
quiet
,
waiting
to
sever
these
last
when
the
strain
should
be
*NL*
once
more
lightened
by
a
breath
of
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
I
had
heard
the
sound
of
loud
voices
from
the
cabin
,
but
*NL*
to
say
truth
,
my
mind
had
been
so
entirely
taken
up
with
other
thoughts
*NL*
that
I
had
scarcely
given
ear
.
Now
,
however
,
when
I
had
nothing
else
to
*NL*
do
,
I
began
to
pay
more
heed
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
I
recognized
for
the
coxswain
's
,
Israel
Hands
,
that
had
been
Flint
's
*NL*
gunner
in
former
days
.
The
other
was
,
of
course
,
my
friend
of
the
red
*NL*
night-cap
.
Both
men
were
plainly
the
worse
of
drink
,
and
they
were
still
*NL*
drinking
,
for
even
while
I
was
listening
,
one
of
them
,
with
a
drunken
*NL*
cry
,
opened
the
stern
window
and
threw
out
something
,
which
I
divined
to
*NL*
be
an
empty
bottle
.
But
they
were
not
only
tipsy
;
it
was
plain
that
they
*NL*
were
furiously
angry
.
Oaths
flew
like
hailstones
,
and
every
now
and
*NL*
then
there
came
forth
such
an
explosion
as
I
thought
was
sure
to
end
*NL*
in
blows
.
But
each
time
the
quarrel
passed
off
and
the
voices
grumbled
*NL*
lower
for
a
while
,
until
the
next
crisis
came
and
in
its
turn
passed
*NL*
away
without
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
shore
,
I
could
see
the
glow
of
the
great
camp-fire
burning
warmly
*NL*
through
the
shore-side
trees
.
Someone
was
singing
,
a
dull
,
old
,
droning
*NL*
sailor
's
song
,
with
a
droop
and
a
quaver
at
the
end
of
every
verse
,
*NL*
and
seemingly
no
end
to
it
at
all
but
the
patience
of
the
singer
.
I
had
*NL*
heard
it
on
the
voyage
more
than
once
and
remembered
these
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
one
man
of
her
crew
alive
,
*NL*
What
put
to
sea
with
seventy-five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
I
thought
it
was
a
ditty
rather
too
dolefully
appropriate
for
a
*NL*
company
that
had
met
such
cruel
losses
in
the
morning
.
But
,
indeed
,
from
*NL*
what
I
saw
,
all
these
buccaneers
were
as
callous
as
the
sea
they
sailed
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
breeze
came
;
the
schooner
sidled
and
drew
nearer
in
the
*NL*
dark
;
I
felt
the
hawser
slacken
once
more
,
and
with
a
good
,
tough
*NL*
effort
,
cut
the
last
fibres
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
breeze
had
but
little
action
on
the
coracle
,
and
I
was
almost
*NL*
instantly
swept
against
the
bows
of
the
HISPANIOLA
.
At
the
same
time
,
*NL*
the
schooner
began
to
turn
upon
her
heel
,
spinning
slowly
,
end
for
end
,
*NL*
across
the
current
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wrought
like
a
fiend
,
for
I
expected
every
moment
to
be
swamped
;
and
*NL*
since
I
found
I
could
not
push
the
coracle
directly
off
,
I
now
shoved
*NL*
straight
astern
.
At
length
I
was
clear
of
my
dangerous
neighbour
,
and
*NL*
just
as
I
gave
the
last
impulsion
,
my
hands
came
across
a
light
cord
*NL*
that
was
trailing
overboard
across
the
stern
bulwarks
.
Instantly
I
*NL*
grasped
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
I
should
have
done
so
I
can
hardly
say
.
It
was
at
first
mere
*NL*
instinct
,
but
once
I
had
it
in
my
hands
and
found
it
fast
,
curiosity
*NL*
began
to
get
the
upper
hand
,
and
I
determined
I
should
have
one
look
*NL*
through
the
cabin
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
pulled
in
hand
over
hand
on
the
cord
,
and
when
I
judged
myself
near
*NL*
enough
,
rose
at
infinite
risk
to
about
half
my
height
and
thus
commanded
*NL*
the
roof
and
a
slice
of
the
interior
of
the
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
schooner
and
her
little
consort
were
gliding
pretty
*NL*
swiftly
through
the
water
;
indeed
,
we
had
already
fetched
up
level
with
*NL*
the
camp-fire
.
The
ship
was
talking
,
as
sailors
say
,
loudly
,
treading
*NL*
the
innumerable
ripples
with
an
incessant
weltering
splash
;
and
until
I
*NL*
got
my
eye
above
the
window-sill
I
could
not
comprehend
why
the
watchmen
*NL*
had
taken
no
alarm
.
One
glance
,
however
,
was
sufficient
;
and
it
was
*NL*
only
one
glance
that
I
durst
take
from
that
unsteady
skiff
.
It
showed
me
*NL*
Hands
and
his
companion
locked
together
in
deadly
wrestle
,
each
with
a
*NL*
hand
upon
the
other
's
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dropped
upon
the
thwart
again
,
none
too
soon
,
for
I
was
near
*NL*
overboard
.
I
could
see
nothing
for
the
moment
but
these
two
furious
,
*NL*
encrimsoned
faces
swaying
together
under
the
smoky
lamp
,
and
I
shut
my
*NL*
eyes
to
let
them
grow
once
more
familiar
with
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
endless
ballad
had
come
to
an
end
at
last
,
and
the
whole
diminished
*NL*
company
about
the
camp-fire
had
broken
into
the
chorus
I
had
heard
so
*NL*
often
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
men
on
the
dead
man
's
chest
--
*NL*
Yo-ho-ho
,
and
a
bottle
of
rum
!
*NL*
Drink
and
the
devil
had
done
for
the
rest
--
*NL*
Yo-ho-ho
,
and
a
bottle
of
rum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
just
thinking
how
busy
drink
and
the
devil
were
at
that
very
*NL*
moment
in
the
cabin
of
the
HISPANIOLA
,
when
I
was
surprised
by
a
sudden
*NL*
lurch
of
the
coracle
.
At
the
same
moment
,
she
yawed
sharply
and
seemed
*NL*
to
change
her
course
.
The
speed
in
the
meantime
had
strangely
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
opened
my
eyes
at
once
.
All
round
me
were
little
ripples
,
combing
*NL*
over
with
a
sharp
,
bristling
sound
and
slightly
phosphorescent
.
The
*NL*
HISPANIOLA
herself
,
a
few
yards
in
whose
wake
I
was
still
being
whirled
*NL*
along
,
seemed
to
stagger
in
her
course
,
and
I
saw
her
spars
toss
a
*NL*
little
against
the
blackness
of
the
night
;
nay
,
as
I
looked
longer
,
I
*NL*
made
sure
she
also
was
wheeling
to
the
southward
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
glanced
over
my
shoulder
,
and
my
heart
jumped
against
my
ribs
.
There
,
*NL*
right
behind
me
,
was
the
glow
of
the
camp-fire
.
The
current
had
turned
*NL*
at
right
angles
,
sweeping
round
along
with
it
the
tall
schooner
and
*NL*
the
little
dancing
coracle
;
ever
quickening
,
ever
bubbling
higher
,
ever
*NL*
muttering
louder
,
it
went
spinning
through
the
narrows
for
the
open
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
schooner
in
front
of
me
gave
a
violent
yaw
,
turning
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
through
twenty
degrees
;
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
one
*NL*
shout
followed
another
from
on
board
;
I
could
hear
feet
pounding
on
*NL*
the
companion
ladder
and
I
knew
that
the
two
drunkards
had
at
last
been
*NL*
interrupted
in
their
quarrel
and
awakened
to
a
sense
of
their
disaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lay
down
flat
in
the
bottom
of
that
wretched
skiff
and
devoutly
*NL*
recommended
my
spirit
to
its
Maker
.
At
the
end
of
the
straits
,
I
*NL*
made
sure
we
must
fall
into
some
bar
of
raging
breakers
,
where
all
my
*NL*
troubles
would
be
ended
speedily
;
and
though
I
could
,
perhaps
,
bear
to
*NL*
die
,
I
could
not
bear
to
look
upon
my
fate
as
it
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
I
must
have
lain
for
hours
,
continually
beaten
to
and
fro
upon
the
*NL*
billows
,
now
and
again
wetted
with
flying
sprays
,
and
never
ceasing
to
*NL*
expect
death
at
the
next
plunge
.
Gradually
weariness
grew
upon
me
;
a
*NL*
numbness
,
an
occasional
stupor
,
fell
upon
my
mind
even
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
my
terrors
,
until
sleep
at
last
supervened
and
in
my
sea-tossed
coracle
*NL*
I
lay
and
dreamed
of
home
and
the
old
Admiral
Benbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
Cruise
of
the
Coracle
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
broad
day
when
I
awoke
and
found
myself
tossing
at
the
south-west
*NL*
end
of
Treasure
Island
.
The
sun
was
up
but
was
still
hid
from
me
behind
*NL*
the
great
bulk
of
the
Spy-glass
,
which
on
this
side
descended
almost
to
*NL*
the
sea
in
formidable
cliffs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haulbowline
Head
and
Mizzen-mast
Hill
were
at
my
elbow
,
the
hill
bare
*NL*
and
dark
,
the
head
bound
with
cliffs
forty
or
fifty
feet
high
and
*NL*
fringed
with
great
masses
of
fallen
rock
.
I
was
scarce
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
mile
to
seaward
,
and
it
was
my
first
thought
to
paddle
in
and
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
notion
was
soon
given
over
.
Among
the
fallen
rocks
the
breakers
*NL*
spouted
and
bellowed
;
loud
reverberations
,
heavy
sprays
flying
and
*NL*
falling
,
succeeded
one
another
from
second
to
second
;
and
I
saw
myself
,
*NL*
if
I
ventured
nearer
,
dashed
to
death
upon
the
rough
shore
or
spending
*NL*
my
strength
in
vain
to
scale
the
beetling
crags
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
that
all
,
for
crawling
together
on
flat
tables
of
rock
or
*NL*
letting
themselves
drop
into
the
sea
with
loud
reports
I
beheld
huge
*NL*
slimy
monsters
--
soft
snails
,
as
it
were
,
of
incredible
bigness
--
two
*NL*
or
three
score
of
them
together
,
making
the
rocks
to
echo
with
their
*NL*
barkings
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
understood
since
that
they
were
sea
lions
,
and
entirely
harmless
.
*NL*
But
the
look
of
them
,
added
to
the
difficulty
of
the
shore
and
the
*NL*
high
running
of
the
surf
,
was
more
than
enough
to
disgust
me
of
that
*NL*
landing-place
.
I
felt
willing
rather
to
starve
at
sea
than
to
confront
*NL*
such
perils
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
I
had
a
better
chance
,
as
I
supposed
,
before
me
.
North
*NL*
of
Haulbowline
Head
,
the
land
runs
in
a
long
way
,
leaving
at
low
tide
*NL*
a
long
stretch
of
yellow
sand
.
To
the
north
of
that
,
again
,
there
comes
*NL*
another
cape
--
Cape
of
the
Woods
,
as
it
was
marked
upon
the
chart
--
buried
*NL*
in
tall
green
pines
,
which
descended
to
the
margin
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remembered
what
Silver
had
said
about
the
current
that
sets
northward
*NL*
along
the
whole
west
coast
of
Treasure
Island
,
and
seeing
from
my
*NL*
position
that
I
was
already
under
its
influence
,
I
preferred
to
leave
*NL*
Haulbowline
Head
behind
me
and
reserve
my
strength
for
an
attempt
to
*NL*
land
upon
the
kindlier-looking
Cape
of
the
Woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
great
,
smooth
swell
upon
the
sea
.
The
wind
blowing
steady
*NL*
and
gentle
from
the
south
,
there
was
no
contrariety
between
that
and
the
*NL*
current
,
and
the
billows
rose
and
fell
unbroken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
it
been
otherwise
,
I
must
long
ago
have
perished
;
but
as
it
was
,
*NL*
it
is
surprising
how
easily
and
securely
my
little
and
light
boat
could
*NL*
ride
.
Often
,
as
I
still
lay
at
the
bottom
and
kept
no
more
than
an
eye
*NL*
above
the
gunwale
,
I
would
see
a
big
blue
summit
heaving
close
above
me
;
*NL*
yet
the
coracle
would
but
bounce
a
little
,
dance
as
if
on
springs
,
and
*NL*
subside
on
the
other
side
into
the
trough
as
lightly
as
a
bird
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
after
a
little
to
grow
very
bold
and
sat
up
to
try
my
skill
at
*NL*
paddling
.
But
even
a
small
change
in
the
disposition
of
the
weight
will
*NL*
produce
violent
changes
in
the
behaviour
of
a
coracle
.
And
I
had
hardly
*NL*
moved
before
the
boat
,
giving
up
at
once
her
gentle
dancing
movement
,
*NL*
ran
straight
down
a
slope
of
water
so
steep
that
it
made
me
giddy
,
and
*NL*
struck
her
nose
,
with
a
spout
of
spray
,
deep
into
the
side
of
the
next
*NL*
wave
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
drenched
and
terrified
,
and
fell
instantly
back
into
my
old
*NL*
position
,
whereupon
the
coracle
seemed
to
find
her
head
again
and
led
*NL*
me
as
softly
as
before
among
the
billows
.
It
was
plain
she
was
not
to
be
*NL*
interfered
with
,
and
at
that
rate
,
since
I
could
in
no
way
influence
her
*NL*
course
,
what
hope
had
I
left
of
reaching
land
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
be
horribly
frightened
,
but
I
kept
my
head
,
for
all
that
.
*NL*
First
,
moving
with
all
care
,
I
gradually
baled
out
the
coracle
with
my
*NL*
sea-cap
;
then
,
getting
my
eye
once
more
above
the
gunwale
,
I
set
myself
*NL*
to
study
how
it
was
she
managed
to
slip
so
quietly
through
the
rollers
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
each
wave
,
instead
of
the
big
,
smooth
glossy
mountain
it
looks
*NL*
from
shore
or
from
a
vessel
's
deck
,
was
for
all
the
world
like
any
range
*NL*
of
hills
on
dry
land
,
full
of
peaks
and
smooth
places
and
valleys
.
The
*NL*
coracle
,
left
to
herself
,
turning
from
side
to
side
,
threaded
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
her
way
through
these
lower
parts
and
avoided
the
steep
slopes
*NL*
and
higher
,
toppling
summits
of
the
wave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
''
thought
I
to
myself
,
``
it
is
plain
I
must
lie
where
I
am
and
*NL*
not
disturb
the
balance
;
but
it
is
plain
also
that
I
can
put
the
paddle
*NL*
over
the
side
and
from
time
to
time
,
in
smooth
places
,
give
her
a
shove
*NL*
or
two
towards
land
.
''
No
sooner
thought
upon
than
done
.
There
I
lay
on
*NL*
my
elbows
in
the
most
trying
attitude
,
and
every
now
and
again
gave
a
*NL*
weak
stroke
or
two
to
turn
her
head
to
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
tiring
and
slow
work
,
yet
I
did
visibly
gain
ground
;
and
as
*NL*
we
drew
near
the
Cape
of
the
Woods
,
though
I
saw
I
must
infallibly
*NL*
miss
that
point
,
I
had
still
made
some
hundred
yards
of
easting
.
I
was
,
*NL*
indeed
,
close
in
.
I
could
see
the
cool
green
tree-tops
swaying
together
*NL*
in
the
breeze
,
and
I
felt
sure
I
should
make
the
next
promontory
without
*NL*
fail
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
high
time
,
for
I
now
began
to
be
tortured
with
thirst
.
The
glow
*NL*
of
the
sun
from
above
,
its
thousandfold
reflection
from
the
waves
,
the
*NL*
sea-water
that
fell
and
dried
upon
me
,
caking
my
very
lips
with
salt
,
*NL*
combined
to
make
my
throat
burn
and
my
brain
ache
.
The
sight
of
the
*NL*
trees
so
near
at
hand
had
almost
made
me
sick
with
longing
,
but
the
*NL*
current
had
soon
carried
me
past
the
point
,
and
as
the
next
reach
of
sea
*NL*
opened
out
,
I
beheld
a
sight
that
changed
the
nature
of
my
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Right
in
front
of
me
,
not
half
a
mile
away
,
I
beheld
the
HISPANIOLA
*NL*
under
sail
.
I
made
sure
,
of
course
,
that
I
should
be
taken
;
but
I
was
*NL*
so
distressed
for
want
of
water
that
I
scarce
knew
whether
to
be
glad
*NL*
or
sorry
at
the
thought
,
and
long
before
I
had
come
to
a
conclusion
,
*NL*
surprise
had
taken
entire
possession
of
my
mind
and
I
could
do
nothing
*NL*
but
stare
and
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
HISPANIOLA
was
under
her
main-sail
and
two
jibs
,
and
the
beautiful
*NL*
white
canvas
shone
in
the
sun
like
snow
or
silver
.
When
I
first
*NL*
sighted
her
,
all
her
sails
were
drawing
;
she
was
lying
a
course
about
*NL*
north-west
,
and
I
presumed
the
men
on
board
were
going
round
the
island
*NL*
on
their
way
back
to
the
anchorage
.
Presently
she
began
to
fetch
more
*NL*
and
more
to
the
westward
,
so
that
I
thought
they
had
sighted
me
and
were
*NL*
going
about
in
chase
.
At
last
,
however
,
she
fell
right
into
the
wind
's
*NL*
eye
,
was
taken
dead
aback
,
and
stood
there
awhile
helpless
,
with
her
*NL*
sails
shivering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clumsy
fellows
,
''
said
I
;
``
they
must
still
be
drunk
as
owls
.
''
And
I
*NL*
thought
how
Captain
Smollett
would
have
set
them
skipping
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
schooner
gradually
fell
off
and
filled
again
upon
another
*NL*
tack
,
sailed
swiftly
for
a
minute
or
so
,
and
brought
up
once
more
dead
*NL*
in
the
wind
's
eye
.
Again
and
again
was
this
repeated
.
To
and
fro
,
up
and
*NL*
down
,
north
,
south
,
east
,
and
west
,
the
HISPANIOLA
sailed
by
swoops
*NL*
and
dashes
,
and
at
each
repetition
ended
as
she
had
begun
,
with
idly
*NL*
flapping
canvas
.
It
became
plain
to
me
that
nobody
was
steering
.
And
if
*NL*
so
,
where
were
the
men
?
Either
they
were
dead
drunk
or
had
deserted
her
,
*NL*
I
thought
,
and
perhaps
if
I
could
get
on
board
I
might
return
the
vessel
*NL*
to
her
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
current
was
bearing
coracle
and
schooner
southward
at
an
equal
rate
.
*NL*
As
for
the
latter
's
sailing
,
it
was
so
wild
and
intermittent
,
and
she
*NL*
hung
each
time
so
long
in
irons
,
that
she
certainly
gained
nothing
,
if
*NL*
she
did
not
even
lose
.
If
only
I
dared
to
sit
up
and
paddle
,
I
made
*NL*
sure
that
I
could
overhaul
her
.
The
scheme
had
an
air
of
adventure
*NL*
that
inspired
me
,
and
the
thought
of
the
water
breaker
beside
the
fore
*NL*
companion
doubled
my
growing
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
I
got
,
was
welcomed
almost
instantly
by
another
cloud
of
spray
,
but
*NL*
this
time
stuck
to
my
purpose
and
set
myself
,
with
all
my
strength
and
*NL*
caution
,
to
paddle
after
the
unsteered
HISPANIOLA
.
Once
I
shipped
a
sea
*NL*
so
heavy
that
I
had
to
stop
and
bail
,
with
my
heart
fluttering
like
*NL*
a
bird
,
but
gradually
I
got
into
the
way
of
the
thing
and
guided
my
*NL*
coracle
among
the
waves
,
with
only
now
and
then
a
blow
upon
her
bows
and
*NL*
a
dash
of
foam
in
my
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
gaining
rapidly
on
the
schooner
;
I
could
see
the
brass
glisten
*NL*
on
the
tiller
as
it
banged
about
,
and
still
no
soul
appeared
upon
her
*NL*
decks
.
I
could
not
choose
but
suppose
she
was
deserted
.
If
not
,
the
men
*NL*
were
lying
drunk
below
,
where
I
might
batten
them
down
,
perhaps
,
and
do
*NL*
what
I
chose
with
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
she
had
been
doing
the
worse
thing
possible
for
*NL*
me
--
standing
still
.
She
headed
nearly
due
south
,
yawing
,
of
course
,
all
*NL*
the
time
.
Each
time
she
fell
off
,
her
sails
partly
filled
,
and
these
*NL*
brought
her
in
a
moment
right
to
the
wind
again
.
I
have
said
this
was
*NL*
the
worst
thing
possible
for
me
,
for
helpless
as
she
looked
in
this
*NL*
situation
,
with
the
canvas
cracking
like
cannon
and
the
blocks
trundling
*NL*
and
banging
on
the
deck
,
she
still
continued
to
run
away
from
me
,
not
*NL*
only
with
the
speed
of
the
current
,
but
by
the
whole
amount
of
her
*NL*
leeway
,
which
was
naturally
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
,
at
last
,
I
had
my
chance
.
The
breeze
fell
for
some
seconds
,
*NL*
very
low
,
and
the
current
gradually
turning
her
,
the
HISPANIOLA
revolved
*NL*
slowly
round
her
centre
and
at
last
presented
me
her
stern
,
with
the
*NL*
cabin
window
still
gaping
open
and
the
lamp
over
the
table
still
burning
*NL*
on
into
the
day
.
The
main-sail
hung
drooped
like
a
banner
.
She
was
*NL*
stock-still
but
for
the
current
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
last
little
while
I
had
even
lost
,
but
now
redoubling
my
*NL*
efforts
,
I
began
once
more
to
overhaul
the
chase
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
a
hundred
yards
from
her
when
the
wind
came
again
in
a
clap
;
*NL*
she
filled
on
the
port
tack
and
was
off
again
,
stooping
and
skimming
*NL*
like
a
swallow
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
first
impulse
was
one
of
despair
,
but
my
second
was
towards
joy
.
*NL*
Round
she
came
,
till
she
was
broadside
on
to
me
--
round
still
till
she
*NL*
had
covered
a
half
and
then
two
thirds
and
then
three
quarters
of
the
*NL*
distance
that
separated
us
.
I
could
see
the
waves
boiling
white
under
*NL*
her
forefoot
.
Immensely
tall
she
looked
to
me
from
my
low
station
in
the
*NL*
coracle
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
of
a
sudden
,
I
began
to
comprehend
.
I
had
scarce
time
to
*NL*
think
--
scarce
time
to
act
and
save
myself
.
I
was
on
the
summit
of
one
*NL*
swell
when
the
schooner
came
stooping
over
the
next
.
The
bowsprit
was
*NL*
over
my
head
.
I
sprang
to
my
feet
and
leaped
,
stamping
the
coracle
under
*NL*
water
.
With
one
hand
I
caught
the
jib-boom
,
while
my
foot
was
lodged
*NL*
between
the
stay
and
the
brace
;
and
as
I
still
clung
there
panting
,
a
*NL*
dull
blow
told
me
that
the
schooner
had
charged
down
upon
and
struck
the
*NL*
coracle
and
that
I
was
left
without
retreat
on
the
HISPANIOLA
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
25
*NL*
*NL*
I
Strike
the
Jolly
Roger
*NL*
*NL*
I
HAD
scarce
gained
a
position
on
the
bowsprit
when
the
flying
jib
*NL*
flapped
and
filled
upon
the
other
tack
,
with
a
report
like
a
gun
.
The
*NL*
schooner
trembled
to
her
keel
under
the
reverse
,
but
next
moment
,
the
*NL*
other
sails
still
drawing
,
the
jib
flapped
back
again
and
hung
idle
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
nearly
tossed
me
off
into
the
sea
;
and
now
I
lost
no
time
,
*NL*
crawled
back
along
the
bowsprit
,
and
tumbled
head
foremost
on
the
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
on
the
lee
side
of
the
forecastle
,
and
the
mainsail
,
which
was
*NL*
still
drawing
,
concealed
from
me
a
certain
portion
of
the
after-deck
.
*NL*
Not
a
soul
was
to
be
seen
.
The
planks
,
which
had
not
been
swabbed
since
*NL*
the
mutiny
,
bore
the
print
of
many
feet
,
and
an
empty
bottle
,
broken
by
*NL*
the
neck
,
tumbled
to
and
fro
like
a
live
thing
in
the
scuppers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
HISPANIOLA
came
right
into
the
wind
.
The
jibs
behind
me
*NL*
cracked
aloud
,
the
rudder
slammed
to
,
the
whole
ship
gave
a
sickening
*NL*
heave
and
shudder
,
and
at
the
same
moment
the
main-boom
swung
inboard
,
*NL*
the
sheet
groaning
in
the
blocks
,
and
showed
me
the
lee
after-deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
the
two
watchmen
,
sure
enough
:
red-cap
on
his
back
,
as
stiff
*NL*
as
a
handspike
,
with
his
arms
stretched
out
like
those
of
a
crucifix
and
*NL*
his
teeth
showing
through
his
open
lips
;
Israel
Hands
propped
against
*NL*
the
bulwarks
,
his
chin
on
his
chest
,
his
hands
lying
open
before
him
on
*NL*
the
deck
,
his
face
as
white
,
under
its
tan
,
as
a
tallow
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
while
the
ship
kept
bucking
and
sidling
like
a
vicious
horse
,
the
*NL*
sails
filling
,
now
on
one
tack
,
now
on
another
,
and
the
boom
swinging
to
*NL*
and
fro
till
the
mast
groaned
aloud
under
the
strain
.
Now
and
again
too
*NL*
there
would
come
a
cloud
of
light
sprays
over
the
bulwark
and
a
heavy
*NL*
blow
of
the
ship
's
bows
against
the
swell
;
so
much
heavier
weather
was
*NL*
made
of
it
by
this
great
rigged
ship
than
by
my
home-made
,
lop-sided
*NL*
coracle
,
now
gone
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
every
jump
of
the
schooner
,
red-cap
slipped
to
and
fro
,
but
--
what
was
*NL*
ghastly
to
behold
--
neither
his
attitude
nor
his
fixed
teeth-disclosing
*NL*
grin
was
anyway
disturbed
by
this
rough
usage
.
At
every
jump
too
,
Hands
*NL*
appeared
still
more
to
sink
into
himself
and
settle
down
upon
the
*NL*
deck
,
his
feet
sliding
ever
the
farther
out
,
and
the
whole
body
canting
*NL*
towards
the
stern
,
so
that
his
face
became
,
little
by
little
,
hid
*NL*
from
me
;
and
at
last
I
could
see
nothing
beyond
his
ear
and
the
frayed
*NL*
ringlet
of
one
whisker
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
I
observed
,
around
both
of
them
,
splashes
of
dark
*NL*
blood
upon
the
planks
and
began
to
feel
sure
that
they
had
killed
each
*NL*
other
in
their
drunken
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
thus
looking
and
wondering
,
in
a
calm
moment
,
when
the
ship
*NL*
was
still
,
Israel
Hands
turned
partly
round
and
with
a
low
moan
writhed
*NL*
himself
back
to
the
position
in
which
I
had
seen
him
first
.
The
moan
,
*NL*
which
told
of
pain
and
deadly
weakness
,
and
the
way
in
which
his
jaw
*NL*
hung
open
went
right
to
my
heart
.
But
when
I
remembered
the
talk
I
had
*NL*
overheard
from
the
apple
barrel
,
all
pity
left
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
walked
aft
until
I
reached
the
main-mast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
aboard
,
Mr.
Hands
,
''
I
said
ironically
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rolled
his
eyes
round
heavily
,
but
he
was
too
far
gone
to
express
*NL*
surprise
.
All
he
could
do
was
to
utter
one
word
,
``
Brandy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
occurred
to
me
there
was
no
time
to
lose
,
and
dodging
the
boom
as
it
*NL*
once
more
lurched
across
the
deck
,
I
slipped
aft
and
down
the
companion
*NL*
stairs
into
the
cabin
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
such
a
scene
of
confusion
as
you
can
hardly
fancy
.
All
the
*NL*
lockfast
places
had
been
broken
open
in
quest
of
the
chart
.
The
floor
*NL*
was
thick
with
mud
where
ruffians
had
sat
down
to
drink
or
consult
after
*NL*
wading
in
the
marshes
round
their
camp
.
The
bulkheads
,
all
painted
in
*NL*
clear
white
and
beaded
round
with
gilt
,
bore
a
pattern
of
dirty
hands
.
*NL*
Dozens
of
empty
bottles
clinked
together
in
corners
to
the
rolling
of
*NL*
the
ship
.
One
of
the
doctor
's
medical
books
lay
open
on
the
table
,
half
*NL*
of
the
leaves
gutted
out
,
I
suppose
,
for
pipelights
.
In
the
midst
of
all
*NL*
this
the
lamp
still
cast
a
smoky
glow
,
obscure
and
brown
as
umber
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
into
the
cellar
;
all
the
barrels
were
gone
,
and
of
the
bottles
*NL*
a
most
surprising
number
had
been
drunk
out
and
thrown
away
.
Certainly
,
*NL*
since
the
mutiny
began
,
not
a
man
of
them
could
ever
have
been
sober
.
*NL*
*NL*
Foraging
about
,
I
found
a
bottle
with
some
brandy
left
,
for
Hands
;
and
*NL*
for
myself
I
routed
out
some
biscuit
,
some
pickled
fruits
,
a
great
bunch
*NL*
of
raisins
,
and
a
piece
of
cheese
.
With
these
I
came
on
deck
,
put
down
*NL*
my
own
stock
behind
the
rudder
head
and
well
out
of
the
coxswain
's
*NL*
reach
,
went
forward
to
the
water-breaker
,
and
had
a
good
deep
drink
of
*NL*
water
,
and
then
,
and
not
till
then
,
gave
Hands
the
brandy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
must
have
drunk
a
gill
before
he
took
the
bottle
from
his
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
''
said
he
,
``
by
thunder
,
but
I
wanted
some
o
'
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
sat
down
already
in
my
own
corner
and
begun
to
eat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
hurt
?
''
I
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
grunted
,
or
rather
,
I
might
say
,
he
barked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
doctor
was
aboard
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'd
be
right
enough
in
a
couple
*NL*
of
turns
,
but
I
do
n't
have
no
manner
of
luck
,
you
see
,
and
that
's
what
's
*NL*
the
matter
with
me
.
As
for
that
swab
,
he
's
good
and
dead
,
he
is
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
indicating
the
man
with
the
red
cap
.
``
He
war
n't
no
seaman
anyhow
.
*NL*
And
where
mought
you
have
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
've
come
aboard
to
take
possession
of
this
ship
,
*NL*
Mr.
Hands
;
and
you
'll
please
regard
me
as
your
captain
until
further
*NL*
notice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
sourly
enough
but
said
nothing
.
Some
of
the
colour
had
*NL*
come
back
into
his
cheeks
,
though
he
still
looked
very
sick
and
still
*NL*
continued
to
slip
out
and
settle
down
as
the
ship
banged
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
by
,
''
I
continued
,
``
I
ca
n't
have
these
colours
,
Mr.
Hands
;
and
by
*NL*
your
leave
,
I
'll
strike
'em
.
Better
none
than
these
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
dodging
the
boom
,
I
ran
to
the
colour
lines
,
handed
down
their
*NL*
cursed
black
flag
,
and
chucked
it
overboard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
save
the
king
!
''
said
I
,
waving
my
cap
.
``
And
there
's
an
end
to
*NL*
Captain
Silver
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
watched
me
keenly
and
slyly
,
his
chin
all
the
while
on
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
I
reckon
,
Cap'n
Hawkins
,
you
'll
kind
of
*NL*
want
to
get
ashore
now
.
S'pose
we
talks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
says
I
,
``
with
all
my
heart
,
Mr.
Hands
.
Say
on
.
''
And
I
went
*NL*
back
to
my
meal
with
a
good
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
man
,
''
he
began
,
nodding
feebly
at
the
corpse
''
--
O'Brien
were
his
*NL*
name
,
a
rank
Irelander
--
this
man
and
me
got
the
canvas
on
her
,
meaning
*NL*
for
to
sail
her
back
.
Well
,
HE
'S
dead
now
,
he
is
--
as
dead
as
bilge
;
and
*NL*
who
's
to
sail
this
ship
,
I
do
n't
see
.
Without
I
gives
you
a
hint
,
you
*NL*
ai
n't
that
man
,
as
far
's
I
can
tell
.
Now
,
look
here
,
you
gives
me
food
*NL*
and
drink
and
a
old
scarf
or
ankecher
to
tie
my
wound
up
,
you
do
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
tell
you
how
to
sail
her
,
and
that
's
about
square
all
round
,
I
take
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
one
thing
,
''
says
I
:
``
I
'm
not
going
back
to
Captain
Kidd
's
*NL*
anchorage
.
I
mean
to
get
into
North
Inlet
and
beach
her
quietly
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
you
did
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Why
,
I
ai
n't
sich
an
infernal
lubber
*NL*
after
all
.
I
can
see
,
ca
n't
I
?
I
've
tried
my
fling
,
I
have
,
and
I
've
*NL*
lost
,
and
it
's
you
has
the
wind
of
me
.
North
Inlet
?
Why
,
I
have
n't
no
*NL*
ch
`
ice
,
not
I
!
I
'd
help
you
sail
her
up
to
Execution
Dock
,
by
thunder
!
*NL*
So
I
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
there
was
some
sense
in
this
.
We
struck
our
*NL*
bargain
on
the
spot
.
In
three
minutes
I
had
the
HISPANIOLA
sailing
*NL*
easily
before
the
wind
along
the
coast
of
Treasure
Island
,
with
good
*NL*
hopes
of
turning
the
northern
point
ere
noon
and
beating
down
again
as
*NL*
far
as
North
Inlet
before
high
water
,
when
we
might
beach
her
safely
and
*NL*
wait
till
the
subsiding
tide
permitted
us
to
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
lashed
the
tiller
and
went
below
to
my
own
chest
,
where
I
got
a
*NL*
soft
silk
handkerchief
of
my
mother
's
.
With
this
,
and
with
my
aid
,
Hands
*NL*
bound
up
the
great
bleeding
stab
he
had
received
in
the
thigh
,
and
after
*NL*
he
had
eaten
a
little
and
had
a
swallow
or
two
more
of
the
brandy
,
he
*NL*
began
to
pick
up
visibly
,
sat
straighter
up
,
spoke
louder
and
clearer
,
*NL*
and
looked
in
every
way
another
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
breeze
served
us
admirably
.
We
skimmed
before
it
like
a
bird
,
the
*NL*
coast
of
the
island
flashing
by
and
the
view
changing
every
minute
.
*NL*
Soon
we
were
past
the
high
lands
and
bowling
beside
low
,
sandy
country
,
*NL*
sparsely
dotted
with
dwarf
pines
,
and
soon
we
were
beyond
that
again
*NL*
and
had
turned
the
corner
of
the
rocky
hill
that
ends
the
island
on
the
*NL*
north
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
greatly
elated
with
my
new
command
,
and
pleased
with
the
bright
,
*NL*
sunshiny
weather
and
these
different
prospects
of
the
coast
.
I
had
now
*NL*
plenty
of
water
and
good
things
to
eat
,
and
my
conscience
,
which
had
*NL*
smitten
me
hard
for
my
desertion
,
was
quieted
by
the
great
conquest
I
*NL*
had
made
.
I
should
,
I
think
,
have
had
nothing
left
me
to
desire
but
for
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
coxswain
as
they
followed
me
derisively
about
the
deck
*NL*
and
the
odd
smile
that
appeared
continually
on
his
face
.
It
was
a
smile
*NL*
that
had
in
it
something
both
of
pain
and
weakness
--
a
haggard
old
man
's
*NL*
smile
;
but
there
was
,
besides
that
,
a
grain
of
derision
,
a
shadow
of
*NL*
treachery
,
in
his
expression
as
he
craftily
watched
,
and
watched
,
and
*NL*
watched
me
at
my
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
26
*NL*
*NL*
Israel
Hands
*NL*
*NL*
THE
wind
,
serving
us
to
a
desire
,
now
hauled
into
the
west
.
We
could
run
*NL*
so
much
the
easier
from
the
north-east
corner
of
the
island
to
the
mouth
*NL*
of
the
North
Inlet
.
Only
,
as
we
had
no
power
to
anchor
and
dared
not
*NL*
beach
her
till
the
tide
had
flowed
a
good
deal
farther
,
time
hung
on
our
*NL*
hands
.
The
coxswain
told
me
how
to
lay
the
ship
to
;
after
a
good
many
*NL*
trials
I
succeeded
,
and
we
both
sat
in
silence
over
another
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cap'n
,
''
said
he
at
length
with
that
same
uncomfortable
smile
,
``
here
's
*NL*
my
old
shipmate
,
O'Brien
;
s
`
pose
you
was
to
heave
him
overboard
.
I
ai
n't
*NL*
partic
`
lar
as
a
rule
,
and
I
do
n't
take
no
blame
for
settling
his
hash
,
*NL*
but
I
do
n't
reckon
him
ornamental
now
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
strong
enough
,
and
I
do
n't
like
the
job
;
and
there
he
lies
,
for
*NL*
me
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
here
's
an
unlucky
ship
,
this
HISPANIOLA
,
Jim
,
''
he
went
on
,
*NL*
blinking
.
``
There
's
a
power
of
men
been
killed
in
this
HISPANIOLA
--
a
*NL*
sight
o
'
poor
seamen
dead
and
gone
since
you
and
me
took
ship
to
*NL*
Bristol
.
I
never
seen
sich
dirty
luck
,
not
I
.
There
was
this
here
*NL*
O'Brien
now
--
he
's
dead
,
ai
n't
he
?
Well
now
,
I
'm
no
scholar
,
and
you
're
a
*NL*
lad
as
can
read
and
figure
,
and
to
put
it
straight
,
do
you
take
it
as
a
*NL*
dead
man
is
dead
for
good
,
or
do
he
come
alive
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
kill
the
body
,
Mr.
Hands
,
but
not
the
spirit
;
you
must
know
*NL*
that
already
,
''
I
replied
.
``
O'Brien
there
is
in
another
world
,
and
may
be
*NL*
watching
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
says
he
.
``
Well
,
that
's
unfort
`
nate
--
appears
as
if
killing
parties
*NL*
was
a
waste
of
time
.
Howsomever
,
sperrits
do
n't
reckon
for
much
,
by
what
*NL*
I
've
seen
.
I
'll
chance
it
with
the
sperrits
,
Jim
.
And
now
,
you
've
spoke
*NL*
up
free
,
and
I
'll
take
it
kind
if
you
'd
step
down
into
that
there
cabin
*NL*
and
get
me
a
--
well
,
a
--
shiver
my
timbers
!
I
ca
n't
hit
the
name
on
`
t
;
*NL*
well
,
you
get
me
a
bottle
of
wine
,
Jim
--
this
here
brandy
's
too
strong
*NL*
for
my
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
coxswain
's
hesitation
seemed
to
be
unnatural
,
and
as
for
the
*NL*
notion
of
his
preferring
wine
to
brandy
,
I
entirely
disbelieved
it
.
The
*NL*
whole
story
was
a
pretext
.
He
wanted
me
to
leave
the
deck
--
so
much
was
*NL*
plain
;
but
with
what
purpose
I
could
in
no
way
imagine
.
His
eyes
never
*NL*
met
mine
;
they
kept
wandering
to
and
fro
,
up
and
down
,
now
with
a
look
*NL*
to
the
sky
,
now
with
a
flitting
glance
upon
the
dead
O'Brien
.
All
the
*NL*
time
he
kept
smiling
and
putting
his
tongue
out
in
the
most
guilty
,
*NL*
embarrassed
manner
,
so
that
a
child
could
have
told
that
he
was
bent
on
*NL*
some
deception
.
I
was
prompt
with
my
answer
,
however
,
for
I
saw
where
*NL*
my
advantage
lay
and
that
with
a
fellow
so
densely
stupid
I
could
easily
*NL*
conceal
my
suspicions
to
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
wine
?
''
I
said
.
``
Far
better
.
Will
you
have
white
or
red
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
reckon
it
's
about
the
blessed
same
to
me
,
shipmate
,
''
he
*NL*
replied
;
``
so
it
's
strong
,
and
plenty
of
it
,
what
's
the
odds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
I
answered
.
``
I
'll
bring
you
port
,
Mr.
Hands
.
But
I
'll
have
*NL*
to
dig
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
I
scuttled
down
the
companion
with
all
the
noise
I
could
,
*NL*
slipped
off
my
shoes
,
ran
quietly
along
the
sparred
gallery
,
mounted
the
*NL*
forecastle
ladder
,
and
popped
my
head
out
of
the
fore
companion
.
I
*NL*
knew
he
would
not
expect
to
see
me
there
,
yet
I
took
every
precaution
*NL*
possible
,
and
certainly
the
worst
of
my
suspicions
proved
too
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
risen
from
his
position
to
his
hands
and
knees
,
and
though
his
*NL*
leg
obviously
hurt
him
pretty
sharply
when
he
moved
--
for
I
could
hear
*NL*
him
stifle
a
groan
--
yet
it
was
at
a
good
,
rattling
rate
that
he
trailed
*NL*
himself
across
the
deck
.
In
half
a
minute
he
had
reached
the
port
*NL*
scuppers
and
picked
,
out
of
a
coil
of
rope
,
a
long
knife
,
or
rather
a
*NL*
short
dirk
,
discoloured
to
the
hilt
with
blood
.
He
looked
upon
it
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
thrusting
forth
his
under
jaw
,
tried
the
point
upon
his
hand
,
*NL*
and
then
,
hastily
concealing
it
in
the
bosom
of
his
jacket
,
trundled
*NL*
back
again
into
his
old
place
against
the
bulwark
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
that
I
required
to
know
.
Israel
could
move
about
,
he
was
*NL*
now
armed
,
and
if
he
had
been
at
so
much
trouble
to
get
rid
of
me
,
*NL*
it
was
plain
that
I
was
meant
to
be
the
victim
.
What
he
would
do
*NL*
afterwards
--
whether
he
would
try
to
crawl
right
across
the
island
from
*NL*
North
Inlet
to
the
camp
among
the
swamps
or
whether
he
would
fire
Long
*NL*
Tom
,
trusting
that
his
own
comrades
might
come
first
to
help
him
--
was
,
*NL*
of
course
,
more
than
I
could
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
I
felt
sure
that
I
could
trust
him
in
one
point
,
since
in
that
*NL*
our
interests
jumped
together
,
and
that
was
in
the
disposition
of
*NL*
the
schooner
.
We
both
desired
to
have
her
stranded
safe
enough
,
in
a
*NL*
sheltered
place
,
and
so
that
,
when
the
time
came
,
she
could
be
got
off
*NL*
again
with
as
little
labour
and
danger
as
might
be
;
and
until
that
was
*NL*
done
I
considered
that
my
life
would
certainly
be
spared
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
I
was
thus
turning
the
business
over
in
my
mind
,
I
had
not
been
*NL*
idle
with
my
body
.
I
had
stolen
back
to
the
cabin
,
slipped
once
more
*NL*
into
my
shoes
,
and
laid
my
hand
at
random
on
a
bottle
of
wine
,
and
now
,
*NL*
with
this
for
an
excuse
,
I
made
my
reappearance
on
the
deck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hands
lay
as
I
had
left
him
,
all
fallen
together
in
a
bundle
and
with
*NL*
his
eyelids
lowered
as
though
he
were
too
weak
to
bear
the
light
.
He
*NL*
looked
up
,
however
,
at
my
coming
,
knocked
the
neck
off
the
bottle
like
*NL*
a
man
who
had
done
the
same
thing
often
,
and
took
a
good
swig
,
with
his
*NL*
favourite
toast
of
``
Here
's
luck
!
''
Then
he
lay
quiet
for
a
little
,
and
*NL*
then
,
pulling
out
a
stick
of
tobacco
,
begged
me
to
cut
him
a
quid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cut
me
a
junk
o
'
that
,
''
says
he
,
``
for
I
have
n't
no
knife
and
hardly
*NL*
strength
enough
,
so
be
as
I
had
.
Ah
,
Jim
,
Jim
,
I
reckon
I
've
missed
*NL*
stays
!
Cut
me
a
quid
,
as
'll
likely
be
the
last
,
lad
,
for
I
'm
for
my
long
*NL*
home
,
and
no
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
'll
cut
you
some
tobacco
,
but
if
I
was
you
and
thought
*NL*
myself
so
badly
,
I
would
go
to
my
prayers
like
a
Christian
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
he
.
``
Now
,
you
tell
me
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
I
cried
.
``
You
were
asking
me
just
now
about
the
dead
.
You
've
*NL*
broken
your
trust
;
you
've
lived
in
sin
and
lies
and
blood
;
there
's
a
man
*NL*
you
killed
lying
at
your
feet
this
moment
,
and
you
ask
me
why
!
For
God
's
*NL*
mercy
,
Mr.
Hands
,
that
's
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
spoke
with
a
little
heat
,
thinking
of
the
bloody
dirk
he
had
hidden
*NL*
in
his
pocket
and
designed
,
in
his
ill
thoughts
,
to
end
me
with
.
He
,
*NL*
for
his
part
,
took
a
great
draught
of
the
wine
and
spoke
with
the
most
*NL*
unusual
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
thirty
years
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
've
sailed
the
seas
and
seen
good
and
*NL*
bad
,
better
and
worse
,
fair
weather
and
foul
,
provisions
running
out
,
*NL*
knives
going
,
and
what
not
.
Well
,
now
I
tell
you
,
I
never
seen
good
come
*NL*
o
'
goodness
yet
.
Him
as
strikes
first
is
my
fancy
;
dead
men
do
n't
bite
;
*NL*
them
's
my
views
--
amen
,
so
be
it
.
And
now
,
you
look
here
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
suddenly
changing
his
tone
,
``
we
've
had
about
enough
of
this
foolery
.
The
*NL*
tide
's
made
good
enough
by
now
.
You
just
take
my
orders
,
Cap'n
Hawkins
,
*NL*
and
we
'll
sail
slap
in
and
be
done
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
told
,
we
had
scarce
two
miles
to
run
;
but
the
navigation
was
*NL*
delicate
,
the
entrance
to
this
northern
anchorage
was
not
only
narrow
*NL*
and
shoal
,
but
lay
east
and
west
,
so
that
the
schooner
must
be
nicely
*NL*
handled
to
be
got
in
.
I
think
I
was
a
good
,
prompt
subaltern
,
and
I
am
*NL*
very
sure
that
Hands
was
an
excellent
pilot
,
for
we
went
about
and
about
*NL*
and
dodged
in
,
shaving
the
banks
,
with
a
certainty
and
a
neatness
that
*NL*
were
a
pleasure
to
behold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scarcely
had
we
passed
the
heads
before
the
land
closed
around
us
.
The
*NL*
shores
of
North
Inlet
were
as
thickly
wooded
as
those
of
the
southern
*NL*
anchorage
,
but
the
space
was
longer
and
narrower
and
more
like
,
what
in
*NL*
truth
it
was
,
the
estuary
of
a
river
.
Right
before
us
,
at
the
southern
*NL*
end
,
we
saw
the
wreck
of
a
ship
in
the
last
stages
of
dilapidation
.
It
*NL*
had
been
a
great
vessel
of
three
masts
but
had
lain
so
long
exposed
to
*NL*
the
injuries
of
the
weather
that
it
was
hung
about
with
great
webs
of
*NL*
dripping
seaweed
,
and
on
the
deck
of
it
shore
bushes
had
taken
root
and
*NL*
now
flourished
thick
with
flowers
.
It
was
a
sad
sight
,
but
it
showed
us
*NL*
that
the
anchorage
was
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Hands
,
``
look
there
;
there
's
a
pet
bit
for
to
beach
a
ship
*NL*
in
.
Fine
flat
sand
,
never
a
cat
's
paw
,
trees
all
around
of
it
,
and
*NL*
flowers
a-blowing
like
a
garding
on
that
old
ship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
once
beached
,
''
I
inquired
,
``
how
shall
we
get
her
off
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
so
,
''
he
replied
:
``
you
take
a
line
ashore
there
on
the
other
side
*NL*
at
low
water
,
take
a
turn
about
one
of
them
big
pines
;
bring
it
back
,
*NL*
take
a
turn
around
the
capstan
,
and
lie
to
for
the
tide
.
Come
high
*NL*
water
,
all
hands
take
a
pull
upon
the
line
,
and
off
she
comes
as
sweet
*NL*
as
natur
'
.
And
now
,
boy
,
you
stand
by
.
We
're
near
the
bit
now
,
and
she
's
*NL*
too
much
way
on
her
.
Starboard
a
little
--
so
--
steady
--
starboard
--
larboard
*NL*
a
little
--
steady
--
steady
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
issued
his
commands
,
which
I
breathlessly
obeyed
,
till
,
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
,
he
cried
,
``
Now
,
my
hearty
,
luff
!
''
And
I
put
the
helm
hard
up
,
*NL*
and
the
HISPANIOLA
swung
round
rapidly
and
ran
stem
on
for
the
low
,
*NL*
wooded
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
excitement
of
these
last
manoeuvres
had
somewhat
interfered
with
the
*NL*
watch
I
had
kept
hitherto
,
sharply
enough
,
upon
the
coxswain
.
Even
then
*NL*
I
was
still
so
much
interested
,
waiting
for
the
ship
to
touch
,
that
I
*NL*
had
quite
forgot
the
peril
that
hung
over
my
head
and
stood
craning
over
*NL*
the
starboard
bulwarks
and
watching
the
ripples
spreading
wide
before
*NL*
the
bows
.
I
might
have
fallen
without
a
struggle
for
my
life
had
not
a
*NL*
sudden
disquietude
seized
upon
me
and
made
me
turn
my
head
.
Perhaps
I
*NL*
had
heard
a
creak
or
seen
his
shadow
moving
with
the
tail
of
my
eye
;
*NL*
perhaps
it
was
an
instinct
like
a
cat
's
;
but
,
sure
enough
,
when
I
looked
*NL*
round
,
there
was
Hands
,
already
half-way
towards
me
,
with
the
dirk
in
*NL*
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
both
have
cried
out
aloud
when
our
eyes
met
,
but
while
mine
*NL*
was
the
shrill
cry
of
terror
,
his
was
a
roar
of
fury
like
a
charging
*NL*
bully
's
.
At
the
same
instant
,
he
threw
himself
forward
and
I
leapt
*NL*
sideways
towards
the
bows
.
As
I
did
so
,
I
let
go
of
the
tiller
,
which
*NL*
sprang
sharp
to
leeward
,
and
I
think
this
saved
my
life
,
for
it
struck
*NL*
Hands
across
the
chest
and
stopped
him
,
for
the
moment
,
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
could
recover
,
I
was
safe
out
of
the
corner
where
he
had
me
*NL*
trapped
,
with
all
the
deck
to
dodge
about
.
Just
forward
of
the
main-mast
*NL*
I
stopped
,
drew
a
pistol
from
my
pocket
,
took
a
cool
aim
,
though
he
had
*NL*
already
turned
and
was
once
more
coming
directly
after
me
,
and
drew
the
*NL*
trigger
.
The
hammer
fell
,
but
there
followed
neither
flash
nor
sound
;
*NL*
the
priming
was
useless
with
sea-water
.
I
cursed
myself
for
my
neglect
.
*NL*
Why
had
not
I
,
long
before
,
reprimed
and
reloaded
my
only
weapons
?
Then
*NL*
I
should
not
have
been
as
now
,
a
mere
fleeing
sheep
before
this
butcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wounded
as
he
was
,
it
was
wonderful
how
fast
he
could
move
,
his
grizzled
*NL*
hair
tumbling
over
his
face
,
and
his
face
itself
as
red
as
a
red
ensign
*NL*
with
his
haste
and
fury
.
I
had
no
time
to
try
my
other
pistol
,
nor
*NL*
indeed
much
inclination
,
for
I
was
sure
it
would
be
useless
.
One
thing
I
*NL*
saw
plainly
:
I
must
not
simply
retreat
before
him
,
or
he
would
speedily
*NL*
hold
me
boxed
into
the
bows
,
as
a
moment
since
he
had
so
nearly
boxed
*NL*
me
in
the
stern
.
Once
so
caught
,
and
nine
or
ten
inches
of
the
*NL*
blood-stained
dirk
would
be
my
last
experience
on
this
side
of
eternity
.
*NL*
I
placed
my
palms
against
the
main-mast
,
which
was
of
a
goodish
bigness
,
*NL*
and
waited
,
every
nerve
upon
the
stretch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
I
meant
to
dodge
,
he
also
paused
;
and
a
moment
or
two
passed
*NL*
in
feints
on
his
part
and
corresponding
movements
upon
mine
.
It
was
such
*NL*
a
game
as
I
had
often
played
at
home
about
the
rocks
of
Black
Hill
Cove
,
*NL*
but
never
before
,
you
may
be
sure
,
with
such
a
wildly
beating
heart
as
*NL*
now
.
Still
,
as
I
say
,
it
was
a
boy
's
game
,
and
I
thought
I
could
hold
*NL*
my
own
at
it
against
an
elderly
seaman
with
a
wounded
thigh
.
Indeed
my
*NL*
courage
had
begun
to
rise
so
high
that
I
allowed
myself
a
few
darting
*NL*
thoughts
on
what
would
be
the
end
of
the
affair
,
and
while
I
saw
*NL*
certainly
that
I
could
spin
it
out
for
long
,
I
saw
no
hope
of
any
*NL*
ultimate
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
while
things
stood
thus
,
suddenly
the
HISPANIOLA
struck
,
*NL*
staggered
,
ground
for
an
instant
in
the
sand
,
and
then
,
swift
as
a
*NL*
blow
,
canted
over
to
the
port
side
till
the
deck
stood
at
an
angle
*NL*
of
forty-five
degrees
and
about
a
puncheon
of
water
splashed
into
the
*NL*
scupper
holes
and
lay
,
in
a
pool
,
between
the
deck
and
bulwark
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
both
of
us
capsized
in
a
second
,
and
both
of
us
rolled
,
almost
*NL*
together
,
into
the
scuppers
,
the
dead
red-cap
,
with
his
arms
still
*NL*
spread
out
,
tumbling
stiffly
after
us
.
So
near
were
we
,
indeed
,
that
my
*NL*
head
came
against
the
coxswain
's
foot
with
a
crack
that
made
my
teeth
*NL*
rattle
.
Blow
and
all
,
I
was
the
first
afoot
again
,
for
Hands
had
got
*NL*
involved
with
the
dead
body
.
The
sudden
canting
of
the
ship
had
made
the
*NL*
deck
no
place
for
running
on
;
I
had
to
find
some
new
way
of
escape
,
*NL*
and
that
upon
the
instant
,
for
my
foe
was
almost
touching
me
.
Quick
as
*NL*
thought
,
I
sprang
into
the
mizzen
shrouds
,
rattled
up
hand
over
hand
,
*NL*
and
did
not
draw
a
breath
till
I
was
seated
on
the
cross-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
saved
by
being
prompt
;
the
dirk
had
struck
not
half
a
foot
*NL*
below
me
as
I
pursued
my
upward
flight
;
and
there
stood
Israel
Hands
*NL*
with
his
mouth
open
and
his
face
upturned
to
mine
,
a
perfect
statue
of
*NL*
surprise
and
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
I
had
a
moment
to
myself
,
I
lost
no
time
in
changing
the
*NL*
priming
of
my
pistol
,
and
then
,
having
one
ready
for
service
,
and
to
*NL*
make
assurance
doubly
sure
,
I
proceeded
to
draw
the
load
of
the
other
*NL*
and
recharge
it
afresh
from
the
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
new
employment
struck
Hands
all
of
a
heap
;
he
began
to
see
the
dice
*NL*
going
against
him
,
and
after
an
obvious
hesitation
,
he
also
hauled
*NL*
himself
heavily
into
the
shrouds
,
and
with
the
dirk
in
his
teeth
,
began
*NL*
slowly
and
painfully
to
mount
.
It
cost
him
no
end
of
time
and
groans
*NL*
to
haul
his
wounded
leg
behind
him
,
and
I
had
quietly
finished
my
*NL*
arrangements
before
he
was
much
more
than
a
third
of
the
way
up
.
Then
,
*NL*
with
a
pistol
in
either
hand
,
I
addressed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
more
step
,
Mr.
Hands
,
''
said
I
,
``
and
I
'll
blow
your
brains
out
!
Dead
*NL*
men
do
n't
bite
,
you
know
,
''
I
added
with
a
chuckle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
instantly
.
I
could
see
by
the
working
of
his
face
that
he
was
*NL*
trying
to
think
,
and
the
process
was
so
slow
and
laborious
that
,
in
my
*NL*
new-found
security
,
I
laughed
aloud
.
At
last
,
with
a
swallow
or
two
,
he
*NL*
spoke
,
his
face
still
wearing
the
same
expression
of
extreme
perplexity
.
*NL*
In
order
to
speak
he
had
to
take
the
dagger
from
his
mouth
,
but
in
all
*NL*
else
he
remained
unmoved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
reckon
we
're
fouled
,
you
and
me
,
and
we
'll
have
to
*NL*
sign
articles
.
I
'd
have
had
you
but
for
that
there
lurch
,
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
have
no
luck
,
not
I
;
and
I
reckon
I
'll
have
to
strike
,
which
comes
hard
,
*NL*
you
see
,
for
a
master
mariner
to
a
ship
's
younker
like
you
,
Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
drinking
in
his
words
and
smiling
away
,
as
conceited
as
a
cock
*NL*
upon
a
wall
,
when
,
all
in
a
breath
,
back
went
his
right
hand
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
Something
sang
like
an
arrow
through
the
air
;
I
felt
a
blow
*NL*
and
then
a
sharp
pang
,
and
there
I
was
pinned
by
the
shoulder
to
the
*NL*
mast
.
In
the
horrid
pain
and
surprise
of
the
moment
--
I
scarce
can
say
*NL*
it
was
by
my
own
volition
,
and
I
am
sure
it
was
without
a
conscious
*NL*
aim
--
both
my
pistols
went
off
,
and
both
escaped
out
of
my
hands
.
They
*NL*
did
not
fall
alone
;
with
a
choked
cry
,
the
coxswain
loosed
his
grasp
*NL*
upon
the
shrouds
and
plunged
head
first
into
the
water
.

``
Pieces

*NL*
*NL*
OWING
to
the
cant
of
the
vessel
,
the
masts
hung
far
out
over
the
water
,
*NL*
and
from
my
perch
on
the
cross-trees
I
had
nothing
below
me
but
the
*NL*
surface
of
the
bay
.
Hands
,
who
was
not
so
far
up
,
was
in
consequence
*NL*
nearer
to
the
ship
and
fell
between
me
and
the
bulwarks
.
He
rose
once
to
*NL*
the
surface
in
a
lather
of
foam
and
blood
and
then
sank
again
for
good
.
*NL*
As
the
water
settled
,
I
could
see
him
lying
huddled
together
on
the
*NL*
clean
,
bright
sand
in
the
shadow
of
the
vessel
's
sides
.
A
fish
or
two
*NL*
whipped
past
his
body
.
Sometimes
,
by
the
quivering
of
the
water
,
he
*NL*
appeared
to
move
a
little
,
as
if
he
were
trying
to
rise
.
But
he
was
dead
*NL*
enough
,
for
all
that
,
being
both
shot
and
drowned
,
and
was
food
for
fish
*NL*
in
the
very
place
where
he
had
designed
my
slaughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
no
sooner
certain
of
this
than
I
began
to
feel
sick
,
faint
,
and
*NL*
terrified
.
The
hot
blood
was
running
over
my
back
and
chest
.
The
dirk
,
*NL*
where
it
had
pinned
my
shoulder
to
the
mast
,
seemed
to
burn
like
a
hot
*NL*
iron
;
yet
it
was
not
so
much
these
real
sufferings
that
distressed
me
,
*NL*
for
these
,
it
seemed
to
me
,
I
could
bear
without
a
murmur
;
it
was
the
*NL*
horror
I
had
upon
my
mind
of
falling
from
the
cross-trees
into
that
*NL*
still
green
water
,
beside
the
body
of
the
coxswain
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
clung
with
both
hands
till
my
nails
ached
,
and
I
shut
my
eyes
as
if
to
*NL*
cover
up
the
peril
.
Gradually
my
mind
came
back
again
,
my
pulses
quieted
*NL*
down
to
a
more
natural
time
,
and
I
was
once
more
in
possession
of
*NL*
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
my
first
thought
to
pluck
forth
the
dirk
,
but
either
it
stuck
too
*NL*
hard
or
my
nerve
failed
me
,
and
I
desisted
with
a
violent
shudder
.
Oddly
*NL*
enough
,
that
very
shudder
did
the
business
.
The
knife
,
in
fact
,
had
come
*NL*
the
nearest
in
the
world
to
missing
me
altogether
;
it
held
me
by
a
mere
*NL*
pinch
of
skin
,
and
this
the
shudder
tore
away
.
The
blood
ran
down
the
*NL*
faster
,
to
be
sure
,
but
I
was
my
own
master
again
and
only
tacked
to
the
*NL*
mast
by
my
coat
and
shirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
last
I
broke
through
with
a
sudden
jerk
,
and
then
regained
the
*NL*
deck
by
the
starboard
shrouds
.
For
nothing
in
the
world
would
I
have
*NL*
again
ventured
,
shaken
as
I
was
,
upon
the
overhanging
port
shrouds
from
*NL*
which
Israel
had
so
lately
fallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
went
below
and
did
what
I
could
for
my
wound
;
it
pained
me
a
good
deal
*NL*
and
still
bled
freely
,
but
it
was
neither
deep
nor
dangerous
,
nor
did
it
*NL*
greatly
gall
me
when
I
used
my
arm
.
Then
I
looked
around
me
,
and
as
the
*NL*
ship
was
now
,
in
a
sense
,
my
own
,
I
began
to
think
of
clearing
it
from
*NL*
its
last
passenger
--
the
dead
man
,
O'Brien
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
pitched
,
as
I
have
said
,
against
the
bulwarks
,
where
he
lay
*NL*
like
some
horrible
,
ungainly
sort
of
puppet
,
life-size
,
indeed
,
but
how
*NL*
different
from
life
's
colour
or
life
's
comeliness
!
In
that
position
*NL*
I
could
easily
have
my
way
with
him
,
and
as
the
habit
of
tragical
*NL*
adventures
had
worn
off
almost
all
my
terror
for
the
dead
,
I
took
him
*NL*
by
the
waist
as
if
he
had
been
a
sack
of
bran
and
with
one
good
heave
,
*NL*
tumbled
him
overboard
.
He
went
in
with
a
sounding
plunge
;
the
red
cap
*NL*
came
off
and
remained
floating
on
the
surface
;
and
as
soon
as
the
splash
*NL*
subsided
,
I
could
see
him
and
Israel
lying
side
by
side
,
both
wavering
*NL*
with
the
tremulous
movement
of
the
water
.
O'Brien
,
though
still
quite
a
*NL*
young
man
,
was
very
bald
.
There
he
lay
,
with
that
bald
head
across
the
*NL*
knees
of
the
man
who
had
killed
him
and
the
quick
fishes
steering
to
and
*NL*
fro
over
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
now
alone
upon
the
ship
;
the
tide
had
just
turned
.
The
sun
was
*NL*
within
so
few
degrees
of
setting
that
already
the
shadow
of
the
pines
*NL*
upon
the
western
shore
began
to
reach
right
across
the
anchorage
and
*NL*
fall
in
patterns
on
the
deck
.
The
evening
breeze
had
sprung
up
,
and
*NL*
though
it
was
well
warded
off
by
the
hill
with
the
two
peaks
upon
the
*NL*
east
,
the
cordage
had
begun
to
sing
a
little
softly
to
itself
and
the
*NL*
idle
sails
to
rattle
to
and
fro
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
see
a
danger
to
the
ship
.
The
jibs
I
speedily
doused
and
*NL*
brought
tumbling
to
the
deck
,
but
the
main-sail
was
a
harder
matter
.
Of
*NL*
course
,
when
the
schooner
canted
over
,
the
boom
had
swung
out-board
,
and
*NL*
the
cap
of
it
and
a
foot
or
two
of
sail
hung
even
under
water
.
I
thought
*NL*
this
made
it
still
more
dangerous
;
yet
the
strain
was
so
heavy
that
I
*NL*
half
feared
to
meddle
.
At
last
I
got
my
knife
and
cut
the
halyards
.
The
*NL*
peak
dropped
instantly
,
a
great
belly
of
loose
canvas
floated
broad
upon
*NL*
the
water
,
and
since
,
pull
as
I
liked
,
I
could
not
budge
the
downhall
,
*NL*
that
was
the
extent
of
what
I
could
accomplish
.
For
the
rest
,
the
*NL*
HISPANIOLA
must
trust
to
luck
,
like
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
the
whole
anchorage
had
fallen
into
shadow
--
the
last
rays
,
*NL*
I
remember
,
falling
through
a
glade
of
the
wood
and
shining
bright
as
*NL*
jewels
on
the
flowery
mantle
of
the
wreck
.
It
began
to
be
chill
;
the
*NL*
tide
was
rapidly
fleeting
seaward
,
the
schooner
settling
more
and
more
*NL*
on
her
beam-ends
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
scrambled
forward
and
looked
over
.
It
seemed
shallow
enough
,
and
*NL*
holding
the
cut
hawser
in
both
hands
for
a
last
security
,
I
let
myself
*NL*
drop
softly
overboard
.
The
water
scarcely
reached
my
waist
;
the
sand
was
*NL*
firm
and
covered
with
ripple
marks
,
and
I
waded
ashore
in
great
spirits
,
*NL*
leaving
the
HISPANIOLA
on
her
side
,
with
her
main-sail
trailing
wide
*NL*
upon
the
surface
of
the
bay
.
About
the
same
time
,
the
sun
went
fairly
*NL*
down
and
the
breeze
whistled
low
in
the
dusk
among
the
tossing
pines
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
least
,
and
at
last
,
I
was
off
the
sea
,
nor
had
I
returned
thence
*NL*
empty-handed
.
There
lay
the
schooner
,
clear
at
last
from
buccaneers
*NL*
and
ready
for
our
own
men
to
board
and
get
to
sea
again
.
I
had
nothing
*NL*
nearer
my
fancy
than
to
get
home
to
the
stockade
and
boast
of
my
*NL*
achievements
.
Possibly
I
might
be
blamed
a
bit
for
my
truantry
,
but
the
*NL*
recapture
of
the
HISPANIOLA
was
a
clenching
answer
,
and
I
hoped
that
*NL*
even
Captain
Smollett
would
confess
I
had
not
lost
my
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
thinking
,
and
in
famous
spirits
,
I
began
to
set
my
face
homeward
for
*NL*
the
block
house
and
my
companions
.
I
remembered
that
the
most
easterly
*NL*
of
the
rivers
which
drain
into
Captain
Kidd
's
anchorage
ran
from
the
*NL*
two-peaked
hill
upon
my
left
,
and
I
bent
my
course
in
that
direction
*NL*
that
I
might
pass
the
stream
while
it
was
small
.
The
wood
was
pretty
*NL*
open
,
and
keeping
along
the
lower
spurs
,
I
had
soon
turned
the
corner
*NL*
of
that
hill
,
and
not
long
after
waded
to
the
mid-calf
across
the
*NL*
watercourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
brought
me
near
to
where
I
had
encountered
Ben
Gunn
,
the
maroon
;
*NL*
and
I
walked
more
circumspectly
,
keeping
an
eye
on
every
side
.
The
dusk
*NL*
had
come
nigh
hand
completely
,
and
as
I
opened
out
the
cleft
between
the
*NL*
two
peaks
,
I
became
aware
of
a
wavering
glow
against
the
sky
,
where
,
as
*NL*
I
judged
,
the
man
of
the
island
was
cooking
his
supper
before
a
roaring
*NL*
fire
.
And
yet
I
wondered
,
in
my
heart
,
that
he
should
show
himself
so
*NL*
careless
.
For
if
I
could
see
this
radiance
,
might
it
not
reach
the
eyes
*NL*
of
Silver
himself
where
he
camped
upon
the
shore
among
the
marshes
?
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
the
night
fell
blacker
;
it
was
all
I
could
do
to
guide
myself
*NL*
even
roughly
towards
my
destination
;
the
double
hill
behind
me
and
the
*NL*
Spy-glass
on
my
right
hand
loomed
faint
and
fainter
;
the
stars
were
few
*NL*
and
pale
;
and
in
the
low
ground
where
I
wandered
I
kept
tripping
among
*NL*
bushes
and
rolling
into
sandy
pits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
kind
of
brightness
fell
about
me
.
I
looked
up
;
a
pale
glimmer
*NL*
of
moonbeams
had
alighted
on
the
summit
of
the
Spy-glass
,
and
soon
after
*NL*
I
saw
something
broad
and
silvery
moving
low
down
behind
the
trees
,
and
*NL*
knew
the
moon
had
risen
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
to
help
me
,
I
passed
rapidly
over
what
remained
to
me
of
my
*NL*
journey
,
and
sometimes
walking
,
sometimes
running
,
impatiently
drew
near
*NL*
to
the
stockade
.
Yet
,
as
I
began
to
thread
the
grove
that
lies
before
*NL*
it
,
I
was
not
so
thoughtless
but
that
I
slacked
my
pace
and
went
a
*NL*
trifle
warily
.
It
would
have
been
a
poor
end
of
my
adventures
to
get
*NL*
shot
down
by
my
own
party
in
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
was
climbing
higher
and
higher
,
its
light
began
to
fall
here
*NL*
and
there
in
masses
through
the
more
open
districts
of
the
wood
,
and
*NL*
right
in
front
of
me
a
glow
of
a
different
colour
appeared
among
*NL*
the
trees
.
It
was
red
and
hot
,
and
now
and
again
it
was
a
little
*NL*
darkened
--
as
it
were
,
the
embers
of
a
bonfire
smouldering
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
life
of
me
I
could
not
think
what
it
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
I
came
right
down
upon
the
borders
of
the
clearing
.
The
western
*NL*
end
was
already
steeped
in
moonshine
;
the
rest
,
and
the
block
house
*NL*
itself
,
still
lay
in
a
black
shadow
chequered
with
long
silvery
streaks
*NL*
of
light
.
On
the
other
side
of
the
house
an
immense
fire
had
burned
*NL*
itself
into
clear
embers
and
shed
a
steady
,
red
reverberation
,
*NL*
contrasted
strongly
with
the
mellow
paleness
of
the
moon
.
There
was
not
*NL*
a
soul
stirring
nor
a
sound
beside
the
noises
of
the
breeze
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stopped
,
with
much
wonder
in
my
heart
,
and
perhaps
a
little
terror
*NL*
also
.
It
had
not
been
our
way
to
build
great
fires
;
we
were
,
indeed
,
*NL*
by
the
captain
's
orders
,
somewhat
niggardly
of
firewood
,
and
I
began
to
*NL*
fear
that
something
had
gone
wrong
while
I
was
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
stole
round
by
the
eastern
end
,
keeping
close
in
shadow
,
and
at
a
*NL*
convenient
place
,
where
the
darkness
was
thickest
,
crossed
the
palisade
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
make
assurance
surer
,
I
got
upon
my
hands
and
knees
and
crawled
,
*NL*
without
a
sound
,
towards
the
corner
of
the
house
.
As
I
drew
nearer
,
my
*NL*
heart
was
suddenly
and
greatly
lightened
.
It
is
not
a
pleasant
noise
in
*NL*
itself
,
and
I
have
often
complained
of
it
at
other
times
,
but
just
*NL*
then
it
was
like
music
to
hear
my
friends
snoring
together
so
loud
and
*NL*
peaceful
in
their
sleep
.
The
sea-cry
of
the
watch
,
that
beautiful
``
All
's
*NL*
well
,
''
never
fell
more
reassuringly
on
my
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
there
was
no
doubt
of
one
thing
;
they
kept
an
infamous
*NL*
bad
watch
.
If
it
had
been
Silver
and
his
lads
that
were
now
creeping
*NL*
in
on
them
,
not
a
soul
would
have
seen
daybreak
.
That
was
what
it
*NL*
was
,
thought
I
,
to
have
the
captain
wounded
;
and
again
I
blamed
myself
*NL*
sharply
for
leaving
them
in
that
danger
with
so
few
to
mount
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
I
had
got
to
the
door
and
stood
up
.
All
was
dark
within
,
*NL*
so
that
I
could
distinguish
nothing
by
the
eye
.
As
for
sounds
,
there
*NL*
was
the
steady
drone
of
the
snorers
and
a
small
occasional
noise
,
a
*NL*
flickering
or
pecking
that
I
could
in
no
way
account
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
my
arms
before
me
I
walked
steadily
in
.
I
should
lie
down
in
my
own
*NL*
place
-LRB-
I
thought
with
a
silent
chuckle
-RRB-
and
enjoy
their
faces
when
they
*NL*
found
me
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
foot
struck
something
yielding
--
it
was
a
sleeper
's
leg
;
and
he
turned
*NL*
and
groaned
,
but
without
awaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
a
shrill
voice
broke
forth
out
of
the
*NL*
darkness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pieces
of
eight
!
Pieces
of
eight
!
Pieces
of
eight
!
Pieces
of
eight
!
*NL*
Pieces
of
eight
!
''
and
so
forth
,
without
pause
or
change
,
like
the
*NL*
clacking
of
a
tiny
mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
's
green
parrot
,
Captain
Flint
!
It
was
she
whom
I
had
heard
*NL*
pecking
at
a
piece
of
bark
;
it
was
she
,
keeping
better
watch
than
any
*NL*
human
being
,
who
thus
announced
my
arrival
with
her
wearisome
refrain
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
no
time
left
me
to
recover
.
At
the
sharp
,
clipping
tone
of
the
*NL*
parrot
,
the
sleepers
awoke
and
sprang
up
;
and
with
a
mighty
oath
,
the
*NL*
voice
of
Silver
cried
,
``
Who
goes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
to
run
,
struck
violently
against
one
person
,
recoiled
,
and
ran
*NL*
full
into
the
arms
of
a
second
,
who
for
his
part
closed
upon
and
held
me
*NL*
tight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
a
torch
,
Dick
,
''
said
Silver
when
my
capture
was
thus
assured
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
one
of
the
men
left
the
log-house
and
presently
returned
with
a
*NL*
lighted
brand
.

PART
SIX
--
Captain
Silver
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
28
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Enemy
's
Camp
*NL*
*NL*
THE
red
glare
of
the
torch
,
lighting
up
the
interior
of
the
block
house
,
*NL*
showed
me
the
worst
of
my
apprehensions
realized
.
The
pirates
were
in
*NL*
possession
of
the
house
and
stores
:
there
was
the
cask
of
cognac
,
*NL*
there
were
the
pork
and
bread
,
as
before
,
and
what
tenfold
increased
*NL*
my
horror
,
not
a
sign
of
any
prisoner
.
I
could
only
judge
that
all
had
*NL*
perished
,
and
my
heart
smote
me
sorely
that
I
had
not
been
there
to
*NL*
perish
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
six
of
the
buccaneers
,
all
told
;
not
another
man
was
left
*NL*
alive
.
Five
of
them
were
on
their
feet
,
flushed
and
swollen
,
suddenly
*NL*
called
out
of
the
first
sleep
of
drunkenness
.
The
sixth
had
only
risen
*NL*
upon
his
elbow
;
he
was
deadly
pale
,
and
the
blood-stained
bandage
round
*NL*
his
head
told
that
he
had
recently
been
wounded
,
and
still
more
recently
*NL*
dressed
.
I
remembered
the
man
who
had
been
shot
and
had
run
back
among
*NL*
the
woods
in
the
great
attack
,
and
doubted
not
that
this
was
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parrot
sat
,
preening
her
plumage
,
on
Long
John
's
shoulder
.
He
*NL*
himself
,
I
thought
,
looked
somewhat
paler
and
more
stern
than
I
was
used
*NL*
to
.
He
still
wore
the
fine
broadcloth
suit
in
which
he
had
fulfilled
his
*NL*
mission
,
but
it
was
bitterly
the
worse
for
wear
,
daubed
with
clay
and
*NL*
torn
with
the
sharp
briers
of
the
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
''
said
he
,
``
here
's
Jim
Hawkins
,
shiver
my
timbers
!
Dropped
in
,
like
,
*NL*
eh
?
Well
,
come
,
I
take
that
friendly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
thereupon
he
sat
down
across
the
brandy
cask
and
began
to
fill
a
*NL*
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
a
loan
of
the
link
,
Dick
,
''
said
he
;
and
then
,
when
he
had
a
*NL*
good
light
,
``
That
'll
do
,
lad
,
''
he
added
;
``
stick
the
glim
in
the
wood
*NL*
heap
;
and
you
,
gentlemen
,
bring
yourselves
to
!
You
need
n't
stand
up
*NL*
for
Mr.
Hawkins
;
HE
'LL
excuse
you
,
you
may
lay
to
that
.
And
so
,
*NL*
Jim
''
--
stopping
the
tobacco
--
``
here
you
were
,
and
quite
a
pleasant
*NL*
surprise
for
poor
old
John
.
I
see
you
were
smart
when
first
I
set
my
*NL*
eyes
on
you
,
but
this
here
gets
away
from
me
clean
,
it
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
this
,
as
may
be
well
supposed
,
I
made
no
answer
.
They
had
set
me
*NL*
with
my
back
against
the
wall
,
and
I
stood
there
,
looking
Silver
in
the
*NL*
face
,
pluckily
enough
,
I
hope
,
to
all
outward
appearance
,
but
with
black
*NL*
despair
in
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
took
a
whiff
or
two
of
his
pipe
with
great
composure
and
then
ran
*NL*
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
you
see
,
Jim
,
so
be
as
you
ARE
here
,
''
says
he
,
``
I
'll
give
you
a
*NL*
piece
of
my
mind
.
I
've
always
liked
you
,
I
have
,
for
a
lad
of
spirit
,
*NL*
and
the
picter
of
my
own
self
when
I
was
young
and
handsome
.
I
always
*NL*
wanted
you
to
jine
and
take
your
share
,
and
die
a
gentleman
,
and
now
,
my
*NL*
cock
,
you
've
got
to
.
Cap'n
Smollett
's
a
fine
seaman
,
as
I
'll
own
up
to
*NL*
any
day
,
but
stiff
on
discipline
.
`
Dooty
is
dooty
,
'
says
he
,
and
right
*NL*
he
is
.
Just
you
keep
clear
of
the
cap'n
.
The
doctor
himself
is
gone
dead
*NL*
again
you
--
`
ungrateful
scamp
'
was
what
he
said
;
and
the
short
and
the
*NL*
long
of
the
whole
story
is
about
here
:
you
ca
n't
go
back
to
your
own
*NL*
lot
,
for
they
wo
n't
have
you
;
and
without
you
start
a
third
ship
's
*NL*
company
all
by
yourself
,
which
might
be
lonely
,
you
'll
have
to
jine
with
*NL*
Cap'n
Silver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
so
good
.
My
friends
,
then
,
were
still
alive
,
and
though
I
partly
*NL*
believed
the
truth
of
Silver
's
statement
,
that
the
cabin
party
were
*NL*
incensed
at
me
for
my
desertion
,
I
was
more
relieved
than
distressed
by
*NL*
what
I
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
say
nothing
as
to
your
being
in
our
hands
,
''
continued
Silver
,
*NL*
``
though
there
you
are
,
and
you
may
lay
to
it
.
I
'm
all
for
argyment
;
I
*NL*
never
seen
good
come
out
o
'
threatening
.
If
you
like
the
service
,
well
,
*NL*
you
'll
jine
;
and
if
you
do
n't
,
Jim
,
why
,
you
're
free
to
answer
no
--
free
*NL*
and
welcome
,
shipmate
;
and
if
fairer
can
be
said
by
mortal
seaman
,
*NL*
shiver
my
sides
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
answer
,
then
?
''
I
asked
with
a
very
tremulous
voice
.
Through
all
*NL*
this
sneering
talk
,
I
was
made
to
feel
the
threat
of
death
that
overhung
*NL*
me
,
and
my
cheeks
burned
and
my
heart
beat
painfully
in
my
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lad
,
''
said
Silver
,
``
no
one
's
a-pressing
of
you

Take
your
bearings
.
*NL*
None
of
us
wo
n't

time
goes
so
pleasant
in
your
company

*NL*
you
see

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
says
I
,
growing
a
bit
bolder
,
``
if
I
'm
to
choose
,
I
declare
I
*NL*
have
a
right
to
know
what

why
you
're
here
,
and
where
my
*NL*
friends
are

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wot
's
wot
?
''
repeated
one
of
the
buccaneers
in
a
deep
growl
.
``
Ah
,
he
'd
*NL*
be
a
lucky
one
as
knowed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
perhaps
batten
down
your
hatches
till
you
're
spoke
to

my
*NL*
friend

''
cried
Silver
truculently
to
this
speaker
.
And
then
,
in
*NL*
his
first
gracious
tones
,
he
replied
to
me
,
``
Yesterday
morning
,
Mr.
*NL*
Hawkins
,
''
said
he
,
``
in
the
dog-watch
,
down
came
Doctor
Livesey
with
a
*NL*
flag
of
truce
.
Says
he
,
`
Cap'n
Silver
,
you
're
sold
out
.
Ship
's
gone
.
'
*NL*
Well
,
maybe
we
'd
been
taking
a
glass
,
and
a
song
to
help
it
round
.
I
*NL*
wo
n't
say
no
.
Leastways
,
none
of
us
had
looked
out
.
We
looked
out
,
and
*NL*
by
thunder
,
the
old
ship
was
gone
!
I
never
seen
a
pack
o
'
fools
look
*NL*
fishier
;
and
you
may
lay
to
that
,
if
I
tells
you
that
looked
the
*NL*
fishiest
.
`
Well
,
'
says
the
doctor
,
`
let
's
bargain
.
'
We
bargained
,
him
*NL*
and
I
,
and
here
we
are
:
stores
,
brandy
,
block
house
,
the
firewood
you
*NL*
was
thoughtful
enough
to
cut
,
and
in
a
manner
of
speaking
,
the
whole
*NL*
blessed
boat
,
from
cross-trees
to
kelson
.
As
for
them
,
they
've
tramped
;
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
where
's
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
again
quietly
at
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
lest
you
should
take
it
into
that
head
of
yours
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
that
*NL*
you
was
included
in
the
treaty
,
here
's
the
last
word
that
was
said
:
`
How
*NL*
many
are
you
,
'
says
I
,
`
to
leave
?
'
`
Four
,
'
says
he
;
`
four
,
and
one
of
us
*NL*
wounded
.
As
for
that
boy
,
I
do
n't
know
where
he
is
,
confound
him

'
says
*NL*
he
,
`
nor
I
do
n't
much
care
.
We
're
about
sick
of
him
.
'
These
was
his
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
all
that
you
're
to
hear

my
son

returned
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
I
am
to
choose

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
you
are
to
choose

you
may
lay
to
that

said
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
I
,
``
I
am
not
such
a
fool
but
I
know
pretty
well
what
I
have
*NL*
to
look
for
.
Let
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
,
it
's
little
I
care
.
I
've
*NL*
seen
too
many
die
since
I
fell
in
with
you
.
But
there
's
a
thing
or
two
*NL*
I
have
to
tell
you
,
''
I
said
,
and
by
this
time
I
was
quite
excited
;
``
and
*NL*
the
first
is
this
:
here
you
are
,
in
a
bad
way
--
ship
lost
,
treasure
lost
,
*NL*
men
lost
,
your
whole
business
gone
to
wreck
;
and
if
you
want
to
know
who
*NL*
did
it
--
it
was
I
!
I
was
in
the
apple
barrel
the
night
we
sighted
land
,
*NL*
and
I
heard
you
,
John
,
and
you
,
Dick
Johnson
,
and
Hands
,
who
is
now
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
and
told
every
word
you
said
before
the
hour
was
*NL*
out
.
And
as
for
the
schooner
,
it
was
I
who
cut
her
cable
,
and
it
was
I
*NL*
that
killed
the
men
you
had
aboard
of
her
,
and
it
was
I
who
brought
her
*NL*
where
you
'll
never
see
her
more
,
not
one
of
you
.
The
laugh
's
on
my
side
;
*NL*
I
've
had
the
top
of
this
business
from
the
first
;
I
no
more
fear
you
*NL*
than
I
fear
a
fly
.
Kill
me
,
if
you
please
,
or
spare
me
.
But
one
thing
*NL*
I
'll
say
,
and
no
more
;
if
you
spare
me
,
bygones
are
bygones
,
and
when
*NL*
you
fellows
are
in
court
for
piracy
,
I
'll
save
you
all
I
can
.
It
is
for
*NL*
you
to
choose
.
Kill
another
and
do
yourselves
no
good
,
or
spare
me
and
*NL*
keep
a
witness
to
save
you
from
the
gallows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
stopped
,
for
,
I
tell
you
,
I
was
out
of
breath
,
and
to
my
wonder
,
not
*NL*
a
man
of
them
moved
,
but
all
sat
staring
at
me
like
as
many
sheep
.
And
*NL*
while
they
were
still
staring
,
I
broke
out
again
,
``
And
now
,
Mr.
Silver
,
''
*NL*
I
said
,
``
I
believe
you
're
the
best
man
here
,
and
if
things
go
to
the
*NL*
worst
,
I
'll
take
it
kind
of
you
to
let
the
doctor
know
the
way
I
took
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
bear
it
in
mind
,
''
said
Silver
with
an
accent
so
curious
that
I
*NL*
could
not
,
for
the
life
of
me
,
decide
whether
he
were
laughing
at
my
*NL*
request
or
had
been
favourably
affected
by
my
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
put
one
to
that
,
''
cried
the
old
mahogany-faced
seaman
--
Morgan
*NL*
by
name
--
whom
I
had
seen
in
Long
John
's
public-house
upon
the
quays
of
*NL*
Bristol
.
``
It
was
him
that
knowed
Black
Dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
see
here
,
''
added
the
sea-cook
.
``
I
'll
put
another
again
to
*NL*
that
,
by
thunder
!
For
it
was
this
same
boy
that
faked
the
chart
from
*NL*
Billy
Bones
.
First
and
last
,
we
've
split
upon
Jim
Hawkins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
here
goes
!
''
said
Morgan
with
an
oath
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
sprang
up
,
drawing
his
knife
as
if
he
had
been
twenty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Avast
,
there
!
''
cried
Silver
.
``
Who
are
you
,
Tom
Morgan
?
Maybe
you
*NL*
thought
you
was
cap'n
here
,
perhaps
.
By
the
powers
,
but
I
'll
teach
you
*NL*
better
!
Cross
me
,
and
you
'll
go
where
many
a
good
man
's
gone
before
you
,
*NL*
first
and
last
,
these
thirty
year
back
--
some
to
the
yard-arm
,
shiver
*NL*
my
timbers
,
and
some
by
the
board
,
and
all
to
feed
the
fishes
.
There
's
*NL*
never
a
man
looked
me
between
the
eyes
and
seen
a
good
day
a
`
terwards
,
*NL*
Tom
Morgan
,
you
may
lay
to
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
Morgan
paused
,
but
a
hoarse
murmur
rose
from
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tom
's
right
,
''
said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
stood
hazing
long
enough
from
one

''
added
another
.
``
I
'll
be
hanged
if
*NL*
I
'll
be
hazed
by
you
,
John
Silver
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
any
of
you
gentlemen
want
to
have
it
out
with
ME
?
''
roared
Silver
,
*NL*
bending
far
forward
from
his
position
on
the
keg
,
with
his
pipe
still
*NL*
glowing
in
his
right
hand
.
``
Put
a
name
on
what
you
're
at
;
you
ai
n't
*NL*
dumb

I
reckon
.
Him
that
wants
shall
get
it

Have
I
lived
this
many
*NL*
years
,
and
a
son
of
a
rum
puncheon
cock
his
hat
athwart
my
hawse
at
the
*NL*
latter
end
of
it
?
You
know
the
way
;
you
're
all
gentlemen
o

fortune
,
by
*NL*
your
account
.
Well
,
I
'm
ready
.
Take
a
cutlass
,
him
that
dares
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
see
the
colour
of
his
inside
,
crutch
and
all
,
before
that
pipe
's
empty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
man
stirred
;
not
a
man
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
your
sort
,
is
it
?
''
he
added
,
returning
his
pipe
to
his
mouth
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
're
a
gay
lot
to
look
at

anyway

Not
much
worth
to
fight

ai

P
`

aps
you
can
understand
King
George
's
English

I

cap'n
here
*NL*
by

I
'm
cap'n
here

*NL*
You
wo
n't

as
gentlemen
o

fortune
should

then
,
by
thunder
,
*NL*
you
'll
obey
,
and
you
may
lay
to

I
like
that
boy
,
now
;
I
never
seen
*NL*
a
better
boy
than
that
.
He
's
more
a
man
than
any
pair
of
rats
of
you
in
*NL*
this
here
house
,
and
what
I
say
is
this
:
let
me
see
him
that
'll
lay
a

hand
on
him

that
's
what
I
say
,
and
you
may
lay
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
pause
after
this
.
I
stood
straight
up
against
the
wall
,
*NL*
my
heart
still
going
like
a
sledge-hammer
,
but
with
a
ray
of
hope
*NL*
now
shining
in
my
bosom
.
Silver
leant
back
against
the
wall
,
his
arms
*NL*
crossed
,
his
pipe
in
the
corner
of
his
mouth
,
as
calm
as
though
he
had
*NL*
been
in
church
;
yet
his
eye
kept
wandering
furtively
,
and
he
kept
the
*NL*
tail
of
it
on
his
unruly
followers
.
They
,
on
their
part
,
drew
gradually
*NL*
together
towards
the
far
end
of
the
block
house
,
and
the
low
hiss
of
*NL*
their
whispering
sounded
in
my
ear
continuously
,
like
a
stream
.
One
*NL*
after
another
,
they
would
look
up
,
and
the
red
light
of
the
torch
would
*NL*
fall
for
a
second
on
their
nervous
faces
;
but
it
was
not
towards
me
,
it
*NL*
was
towards
Silver
that
they
turned
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
to
have
a
lot
to
say
,
''
remarked
Silver
,
spitting
far
into
the
*NL*
air
.
``
Pipe
up
and
let
me
hear
it
,
or
lay
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ax
your
pardon
,
sir
,
''
returned
one
of
the
men
;
``
you
're
pretty
free
with
*NL*
some
of
the
rules
;
maybe
you
'll
kindly

an
eye
upon
the

This
*NL*
crew
's
dissatisfied
;
this
crew

n't
vally
bullying
a
marlin-spike
;
this
*NL*
crew
has
its

I
'll
make
so
free

your

take

I
ax
your

sir

*NL*
acknowledging
you
for
to
be
captaing
at
this
present
;
but
I
claim
my
*NL*
right
,
and
steps
outside
for
a
council
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
an
elaborate
sea-salute
,
this
fellow
,
a
long
,
ill-looking
,
*NL*
yellow-eyed
man
of
five
and
thirty
,
stepped
coolly
towards
the
door
and
*NL*
disappeared
out
of
the
house
.
One
after
another
the
rest
followed
his
*NL*
example
,
each
making
a
salute
as
he
passed
,
each
adding
some
apology
.
*NL*
``
According
to
rules
,
''
said
one
.
``
Forecastle
council
,
''
said
Morgan
.
And
*NL*
so
with
one
remark
or
another
all
marched
out
and
left
Silver
and
me
*NL*
alone
with
the
torch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sea-cook
instantly
removed
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
look
you
here
,
Jim
Hawkins
,
''
he
said
in
a
steady
whisper
that
was
*NL*
no
more
than
audible
,
``
you
're
within
half
a
plank
of
death
,
and
what
's
*NL*
a
long
sight
worse
,
of
torture
.
They
're
going
to
throw
me
off
.
But
,
you
*NL*
mark
,
I
stand
by
you
through
thick
and
thin
.
I
did
n't
mean
to
;
no
,
not
*NL*
till
you
spoke
up
.
I
was
about
desperate
to
lose
that
much
blunt
,
and
*NL*
be
hanged
into
the
bargain
.
But
I
see
you
was
the
right
sort
.
I
says
to
*NL*
myself
,
you
stand
by
Hawkins
,
John
,
and
Hawkins
'll
stand
by
you
.
You
're
*NL*
his
last
card
,
and
by
the
living
thunder
,
John
,
he
's
yours

Back
to
*NL*
back

says
I
.
You
save
your
witness

and
he
'll
save
your
neck

*NL*
*NL*
I
began
dimly
to
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
all
's
lost
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
by
gum
,
I
do
!
''
he
answered
.
``
Ship
gone
,
neck
gone
--
that
's
the
*NL*
size
of
it

Once
I
looked
into
that
bay
,
Jim
Hawkins
,
and
seen
no
*NL*
schooner
--
well
,
I
'm
tough
,
but
I
gave
out
.
As
for
that
lot
and
their
*NL*
council
,
mark
me
,
they
're
outright
fools
and
cowards
.
I
'll
save
your
*NL*
life
--
if
so
be
as
I
can
--
from
them
.
But
,
see
here
,
Jim
--
tit
for
tat
--
you
*NL*
save
Long
John
from
swinging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
bewildered
;
it
seemed
a
thing
so
hopeless
he
was
asking
--
he
,
the
*NL*
old
buccaneer
,
the
ringleader
throughout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
can
do
,
that
I
'll
do
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
bargain
!
''
cried
Long
John
.
``
You
speak
up
plucky
,
and
by
thunder
,
*NL*
I
've
a
chance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hobbled
to
the
torch
,
where
it
stood
propped
among
the
firewood
,
and
*NL*
took
a
fresh
light
to
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Understand
me
,
Jim
,
''
he
said
,
returning
.
``
I
've
a
head
on
my
shoulders

*NL*
I
have

I
'm
on
squire

I
know
you
've
got
that
ship
safe
*NL*
somewheres
.
How
you
done
it
,
I
do
n't
know
,
but
safe
it
is
.
I
guess
Hands
*NL*
and
O'Brien
turned
soft
.
I
never
much
believed
in
neither
of
THEM

Now
*NL*
you
mark
me
.
I
ask
no
questions
,
nor
I
wo
n't

I
know
when
*NL*
a
game
's
up
,
I
do
;
and
I
know
a
lad
that
's
staunch

Ah
,
you
that
's
*NL*
young
--
you
and
me
might
have
done
a
power
of
good
together

*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
some
cognac
from
the
cask
into
a
tin
cannikin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
taste
,
messmate
?
''
he
asked
;
and
when
I
had
refused
:
``
Well
,
*NL*
I
'll
take
a
drain
myself
,
Jim
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
need
a
caulker
,
for
there
's
*NL*
trouble
on
hand

And
talking
o

trouble

why
did
that
doctor
give
me
the
*NL*
chart

Jim

''
*NL*
*NL*
My
face
expressed
a
wonder
so
unaffected
that
he
saw
the
needlessness
of
*NL*
further
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
he
did
,
though

''
said
he
.
``
And
there
's
something
under

*NL*
no
doubt
--
something

surely
,
under
that

Jim
--
bad
or
good

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
took
another
swallow
of
the
brandy
,
shaking
his
great
fair
head
*NL*
like
a
man
who
looks
forward
to
the
worst

*NL*
The
Black
Spot
Again
*NL*
*NL*
THE
council
of
buccaneers
had
lasted
some
time
,
when
one
of
them
*NL*
re-entered
the
house
,
and
with
a
repetition
of
the
same
salute
,
which
*NL*
had
in
my
eyes
an
ironical
air
,
begged
for
a
moment
's
loan
of
the
torch
.
*NL*
Silver
briefly
agreed
,
and
this
emissary
retired
again
,
leaving
us
*NL*
together
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
breeze
coming
,
Jim
,
''
said
Silver
,
who
had
by
this
time
*NL*
adopted
quite
a
friendly
and
familiar
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
turned
to
the
loophole
nearest
me
and
looked
out
.
The
embers
of
the
*NL*
great
fire
had
so
far
burned
themselves
out
and
now
glowed
so
low
and
*NL*
duskily
that
I
understood
why
these
conspirators
desired
a
torch
.
About
*NL*
half-way
down
the
slope
to
the
stockade
,
they
were
collected
in
a
group
;
*NL*
one
held
the
light
,
another
was
on
his
knees
in
their
midst
,
and
I
saw
*NL*
the
blade
of
an
open
knife
shine
in
his
hand
with
varying
colours
in
*NL*
the
moon
and
torchlight
.
The
rest
were
all
somewhat
stooping
,
as
though
*NL*
watching
the
manoeuvres
of
this
last
.
I
could
just
make
out
that
he
*NL*
had
a
book
as
well
as
a
knife
in
his
hand
,
and
was
still
wondering
how
*NL*
anything
so
incongruous
had
come
in
their
possession
when
the
kneeling
*NL*
figure
rose
once
more
to
his
feet
and
the
whole
party
began
to
move
*NL*
together
towards
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
they
come
,
''
said
I
;
and
I
returned
to
my
former
position
,
for
it
*NL*
seemed
beneath
my
dignity
that
they
should
find
me
watching
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
let
'em
come
,
lad
--
let
'em
come
,
''
said
Silver
cheerily
.
``
I
've
*NL*
still
a
shot
in
my
locker
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
,
and
the
five
men
,
standing
huddled
together
just
*NL*
inside
,
pushed
one
of
their
number
forward
.
In
any
other
circumstances
*NL*
it
would
have
been
comical
to
see
his
slow
advance
,
hesitating
as
he
set
*NL*
down
each
foot
,
but
holding
his
closed
right
hand
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Step
up
,
lad
,
''
cried
Silver
.
``
I
wo
n't
eat
you
.
Hand
it
over
,
lubber
.
I
*NL*
know
the
rules
,
I
do
;
I
wo
n't
hurt
a
depytation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
encouraged
,
the
buccaneer
stepped
forth
more
briskly
,
and
having
*NL*
passed
something
to
Silver
,
from
hand
to
hand
,
slipped
yet
more
smartly
*NL*
back
again
to
his
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sea-cook
looked
at
what
had
been
given
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
black
spot
!
I
thought
so
,
''
he
observed
.
``
Where
might
you
have
got
*NL*
the
paper
?
Why
,
hillo
!
Look
here
,
now
;
this
ai
n't
lucky
!
You
've
gone
and
*NL*
cut
this
out
of
a
Bible
.
What
fool
's
cut
a
Bible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
!
''
said
Morgan
.
``
There
!
Wot
did
I
say
?
No
good
'll
come
o
'
*NL*
that
,
I
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
've
about
fixed
it
now
,
among
you
,
''
continued
Silver
.
``
You
'll
*NL*
all
swing
now
,
I
reckon
.
What
soft-headed
lubber
had
a
Bible
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Dick
,
''
said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dick
,
was
it
?
Then
Dick
can
get
to
prayers
,
''
said
Silver
.
``
He
's
seen
*NL*
his
slice
of
luck
,
has
Dick
,
and
you
may
lay
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
the
long
man
with
the
yellow
eyes
struck
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Belay
that
talk
,
John
Silver
,
''
he
said
.
``
This
crew
has
tipped
you
the
*NL*
black
spot

turn
it
over

Then
you

talk

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanky

George

replied
the
sea-cook
.
``
You

*NL*
``

Silver
*NL*
contemptuously
.

*NL*
``

George

``
you

``

asked
Silver
quietly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Enough

George

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

Well

you

a
been

Well

who
crossed

Who
forced
my

as
was
the

lawful
cap'n

Who
tipped
me
the
black
spot
the
day
we
landed

began
*NL*
this
dance

Ah
,
it
's
a
fine
dance

I
'm
with

there

looks
mighty

a
hornpipe
in
a
rope
's
end
at
Execution
Dock
by
London
town

it
*NL*
does

But
who
done
it

Why
,
it
was
Anderson

Hands

you

George
*NL*
Merry
!
And
you
're
the
last
above

you
have
the
Davy

insolence

stand
for

over

me

you

that
sank

By

this
tops
the

stiffest
yarn
to

*NL*
*NL*
Silver
paused
,
and
I
could
see
by
the
faces
of
George
and
his
late
*NL*
comrades
that
these
words
had
not
been
said
in
vain

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's

number
one

cried
the
accused
,
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
*NL*
brow
,
for
he
had
been
talking
with
a
vehemence
that
shook
the
house
.
*NL*
``
Why

I
give
you
my
word

I
'm
sick

I
leave

By
gum
,
if
you
could
understand
how
bad
*NL*
it
's
bungled
,
you
would
see
!
We
're
that
near
the
gibbet
that
my
neck
's
*NL*
stiff
with
thinking
on
it
.
You
've
seen
'em
,
maybe
,
hanged
in
chains
,
*NL*
birds
about
'em
,
seamen
p
`
inting
'em
out
as
they
go
down
with
the
tide
.
*NL*
`
Who
's
that
?
'
says
one
.
`
That
!
Why
,
that
's
John
Silver
.
I
knowed
him
*NL*
well
,
'
says
another
.
And
you
can
hear
the
chains
a-jangle
as
you
go
*NL*
about
and
reach
for
the
other
buoy
.
Now
,
that
's
about
where
we
are
,
*NL*
every
mother
's
son
of
us
,
thanks
to
him
,
and
Hands
,
and
Anderson
,
and
*NL*
other
ruination
fools
of
you
.
And
if
you
want
to
know
about
number
four
,
*NL*
and
that
boy
,
why
,
shiver
my
timbers
,
is
n't
he
a
hostage
?
Are
we
a-going
*NL*
to
waste
a
hostage
?
No
,
not
us
;
he
might
be
our
last
chance
,
and
I
*NL*
should
n't
wonder
.
Kill
that
boy
?
Not
me
,
mates
!
And
number
three
?
Ah
,
*NL*
well
,
there
's
a
deal
to
say
to
number
three
.
Maybe
you
do
n't
count
it
*NL*
nothing
to
have
a
real
college
doctor
to
see
you
every
day
--
you
,
John
,
*NL*
with
your
head
broke
--
or
you
,
George
Merry
,
that
had
the
ague
shakes
*NL*
upon
you
not
six
hours
agone
,
and
has
your
eyes
the
colour
of
lemon
peel
*NL*
to
this
same
moment
on
the
clock
?
And
maybe
,
perhaps
,
you
did
n't
know
*NL*
there
was
a
consort
coming
either
?
But
there
is
,
and
not
so
long
till
*NL*
then
;
and
we
'll
see
who
'll
be
glad
to
have
a
hostage
when
it
comes
to
*NL*
that
.
And
as
for
number
two
,
and
why
I
made
a
bargain
--
well
,
you
came
*NL*
crawling
on
your
knees
to
me
to
make
it
--
on
your
knees
you
came
,
you
was
*NL*
that
downhearted
--
and
you
'd
have
starved
too
if
I
had
n't
--
but
that
's
a
*NL*
trifle
!
You
look
there
--
that
's
why
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
cast
down
upon
the
floor
a
paper
that
I
instantly
*NL*
recognized
--
none
other
than
the
chart
on
yellow
paper
,
with
the
three
*NL*
red
crosses
,
that
I
had
found
in
the
oilcloth
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
captain
's
chest
.
Why
the
doctor
had
given
it
to
him
was
more
than
I
*NL*
could
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
it
were
inexplicable
to
me
,
the
appearance
of
the
chart
was
*NL*
incredible
to
the
surviving
mutineers
.
They
leaped
upon
it
like
cats
*NL*
upon
a
mouse
.
It
went
from
hand
to
hand
,
one
tearing
it
from
another
;
*NL*
and
by
the
oaths
and
the
cries
and
the
childish
laughter
with
which
they
*NL*
accompanied
their
examination
,
you
would
have
thought
,
not
only
they
*NL*
were
fingering
the
very
gold
,
but
were
at
sea
with
it
,
besides
,
in
*NL*
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
one
,
``
that
's
Flint
,
sure
enough
.
J.
F.
,
and
a
score
below
,
*NL*
with
a
clove
hitch
to
it
;
so
he
done
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mighty
pretty
,
''
said
George
.
``
But
how
are
we
to
get
away
with
it
,
and
*NL*
us
no
ship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
suddenly
sprang
up
,
and
supporting
himself
with
a
hand
against
*NL*
the
wall
:
``
Now
I
give
you
warning
,
George
,
''
he
cried
.
``
One
more
word
*NL*
of
your
sauce
,
and
I
'll
call
you
down
and
fight
you
.
How
?
Why
,
how
do
I
*NL*
know
?
You
had
ought
to
tell
me
that
--
you
and
the
rest
,
that
lost
me
my
*NL*
schooner
,
with
your
interference
,
burn
you
!
But
not
you
,
you
ca
n't
;
you
*NL*
hai
n't
got
the
invention
of
a
cockroach
.
But
civil
you
can
speak
,
and
*NL*
shall
,
George
Merry
,
you
may
lay
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
fair
enow
,
''
said
the
old
man
Morgan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fair
!
I
reckon
so
,
''
said
the
sea-cook
.
``
You
lost
the
ship
;
I
found
the
*NL*
treasure
.
Who
's
the
better
man
at
that
?
And
now
I
resign
,
by
thunder
!
*NL*
Elect
whom
you
please
to
be
your
cap'n
now
;
I
'm
done
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silver
!
''
they
cried
.
``
Barbecue
forever
!
Barbecue
for
cap'n
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
that
's
the
toon
,
is
it
?
''
cried
the
cook
.
``
George
,
I
reckon
you
'll
*NL*
have
to
wait
another
turn
,
friend
;
and
lucky
for
you
as
I
'm
not
a
*NL*
revengeful
man
.
But
that
was
never
my
way
.
And
now
,
shipmates
,
this
*NL*
black
spot
?
`
Tai
n't
much
good
now
,
is
it
?
Dick
's
crossed
his
luck
and
*NL*
spoiled
his
Bible
,
and
that
's
about
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
'll
do
to
kiss
the
book
on
still
,
wo
n't
it
?
''
growled
Dick
,
who
was
*NL*
evidently
uneasy
at
the
curse
he
had
brought
upon
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Bible
with
a
bit
cut
out
!
''
returned
Silver
derisively
.
``
Not
it
.
It
*NL*
do
n't
bind
no
more
'n
a
ballad-book
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
it
,
though
?
''
cried
Dick
with
a
sort
of
joy
.
``
Well
,
I
reckon
*NL*
that
's
worth
having
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
Jim
--
here
's
a
cur
`
osity
for
you
,
''
said
Silver
,
and
he
tossed
me
*NL*
the
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
around
about
the
size
of
a
crown
piece
.
One
side
was
blank
,
*NL*
for
it
had
been
the
last
leaf
;
the
other
contained
a
verse
or
two
of
*NL*
Revelation
--
these
words
among
the
rest
,
which
struck
sharply
home
upon
*NL*
my
mind
:
``
Without
are
dogs
and
murderers
.
''
The
printed
side
had
been
*NL*
blackened
with
wood
ash
,
which
already
began
to
come
off
and
soil
my
*NL*
fingers
;
on
the
blank
side
had
been
written
with
the
same
material
the
*NL*
one
word
``
Depposed
.
''
I
have
that
curiosity
beside
me
at
this
moment
,
but
*NL*
not
a
trace
of
writing
now
remains
beyond
a
single
scratch
,
such
as
a
*NL*
man
might
make
with
his
thumb-nail
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
end
of
the
night
's
business
.
Soon
after
,
with
a
drink
all
*NL*
round
,
we
lay
down
to
sleep
,
and
the
outside
of
Silver
's
vengeance
was
*NL*
to
put
George
Merry
up
for
sentinel
and
threaten
him
with
death
if
he
*NL*
should
prove
unfaithful
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
long
ere
I
could
close
an
eye
,
and
heaven
knows
I
had
matter
*NL*
enough
for
thought
in
the
man
whom
I
had
slain
that
afternoon
,
in
my
own
*NL*
most
perilous
position
,
and
above
all
,
in
the
remarkable
game
that
I
saw
*NL*
Silver
now
engaged
upon
--
keeping
the
mutineers
together
with
one
hand
*NL*
and
grasping
with
the
other
after
every
means
,
possible
and
impossible
,
*NL*
to
make
his
peace
and
save
his
miserable
life
.
He
himself
slept
*NL*
peacefully
and
snored
aloud
,
yet
my
heart
was
sore
for
him
,
wicked
as
he
*NL*
was
,
to
think
on
the
dark
perils
that
environed
and
the
shameful
gibbet
*NL*
that
awaited
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
30
*NL*
*NL*
On
Parole
*NL*
*NL*
I
WAS
wakened
--
indeed
,
we
were
all
wakened
,
for
I
could
see
even
the
*NL*
sentinel
shake
himself
together
from
where
he
had
fallen
against
the
*NL*
door-post
--
by
a
clear
,
hearty
voice
hailing
us
from
the
margin
of
the
*NL*
wood
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Block
house
,
ahoy
!
''
it
cried
.
``
Here
's
the
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
doctor
it
was
.
Although
I
was
glad
to
hear
the
sound
,
yet
my
*NL*
gladness
was
not
without
admixture
.
I
remembered
with
confusion
my
*NL*
insubordinate
and
stealthy
conduct
,
and
when
I
saw
where
it
had
brought
*NL*
me
--
among
what
companions
and
surrounded
by
what
dangers
--
I
felt
ashamed
*NL*
to
look
him
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
must
have
risen
in
the
dark
,
for
the
day
had
hardly
come
;
and
when
I
*NL*
ran
to
a
loophole
and
looked
out
,
I
saw
him
standing
,
like
Silver
once
*NL*
before
,
up
to
the
mid-leg
in
creeping
vapour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
,
doctor
!
Top
o
'
the
morning
to
you
,
sir
!
''
cried
Silver
,
broad
awake
*NL*
and
beaming
with
good
nature
in
a
moment
.
``
Bright
and
early
,
to
be
sure
;
*NL*
and
it
's
the
early
bird
,
as
the
saying
goes
,
that
gets
the
rations
.
*NL*
George
,
shake
up
your
timbers
,
son
,
and
help
Dr.
Livesey
over
the
ship
's
*NL*
side
.
All
a-doin
'
well
,
your
patients
was
--
all
well
and
merry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
pattered
on
,
standing
on
the
hilltop
with
his
crutch
under
his
*NL*
elbow
and
one
hand
upon
the
side
of
the
log-house
--
quite
the
old
John
in
*NL*
voice
,
manner
,
and
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
've
quite
a
surprise
for
you
too
,
sir
,
''
he
continued
.
``
We
've
a
little
*NL*
stranger
here
--
he
!
he
!
A
noo
boarder
and
lodger
,
sir
,
and
looking
fit
*NL*
and
taut
as
a
fiddle
;
slep
'
like
a
supercargo
,
he
did
,
right
alongside
*NL*
of
John
--
stem
to
stem
we
was
,
all
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Livesey
was
by
this
time
across
the
stockade
and
pretty
near
the
*NL*
cook
,
and
I
could
hear
the
alteration
in
his
voice
as
he
said
,
``
Not
*NL*
Jim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
same
Jim
as
ever
was
,
''
says
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
stopped
outright
,
although
he
did
not
speak
,
and
it
was
some
*NL*
seconds
before
he
seemed
able
to
move
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
''
he
said
at
last
,
``
duty
first
and
pleasure
afterwards
,
as
*NL*
you
might
have
said
yourself
,
Silver
.
Let
us
overhaul
these
patients
of
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
afterwards
he
had
entered
the
block
house
and
with
one
grim
*NL*
nod
to
me
proceeded
with
his
work
among
the
sick
.
He
seemed
under
no
*NL*
apprehension
,
though
he
must
have
known
that
his
life
,
among
these
*NL*
treacherous
demons
,
depended
on
a
hair
;
and
he
rattled
on
to
his
*NL*
patients
as
if
he
were
paying
an
ordinary
professional
visit
in
a
quiet
*NL*
English
family
.
His
manner
,
I
suppose
,
reacted
on
the
men
,
for
they
*NL*
behaved
to
him
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
,
as
if
he
were
still
ship
's
*NL*
doctor
and
they
still
faithful
hands
before
the
mast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
doing
well
,
my
friend
,
''
he
said
to
the
fellow
with
the
bandaged
*NL*
head
,
``
and
if
ever
any
person
had
a
close
shave
,
it
was
you
;
your
head
*NL*
must
be
as
hard
as
iron
.
Well
,
George
,
how
goes
it
?
You
're
a
pretty
*NL*
colour
,
certainly
;
why
,
your
liver
,
man
,
is
upside
down
.
Did
you
take
*NL*
that
medicine
?
Did
he
take
that
medicine
,
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
sir
,
he
took
it
,
sure
enough
,
''
returned
Morgan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
you
see
,
since
I
am
mutineers
'
doctor
,
or
prison
doctor
as
I
*NL*
prefer
to
call
it
,
''
says
Doctor
Livesey
in
his
pleasantest
way
,
``
I
make
*NL*
it
a
point
of
honour
not
to
lose
a
man
for
King
George

!
-RRB-
*NL*
and
the
gallows

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rogues
looked
at
each
other
but
swallowed
the
home-thrust
in
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dick
do
n't
feel
well
,
sir
,

said
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't

''
replied
the
doctor
.
``
Well
,
step
up
here
,
Dick
,
and
let
me
*NL*
see
your
tongue
.
No
,
I
should
be
surprised
if
he
did
!
The
man
's
tongue
*NL*
is
fit
to
frighten
the
French
.
Another
fever

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
,
''
said
Morgan
,
``
that
comed
of
sp
`
iling
Bibles

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
comes
--
as
you
call
it
--
of
being
arrant
asses
,
''
retorted
the
*NL*
doctor
,
``
and
not
having
sense
enough
to
know
honest
air
from
poison
,
*NL*
and
the
dry
land
from
a
vile
,
pestiferous
slough
.
I
think
it
most
*NL*
probable
--
though
of
course
it
's
only
an
opinion
--
that
you
'll
all
have
*NL*
the
deuce
to
pay
before
you
get
that
malaria
out
of
your
systems

Camp
*NL*
in
a
bog
,
would
you
?
Silver
,
I
'm
surprised
at
you
.
You
're
less
of
a
fool
*NL*
than
many
,
take
you
all
round
;
but
you
do
n't
appear
to
me
to
have
the
*NL*
rudiments
of
a
notion
of
the
rules
of
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
added
after
he
had
dosed
them
round
and
they
had
taken
*NL*
his
prescriptions
,
with
really
laughable
humility
,
more
like
charity
*NL*
schoolchildren
than
blood-guilty
mutineers
and
pirates
--
``
well
,
that
's
*NL*
done
for
today

And
now
I
should
wish
to
have
a
talk
with
that
boy

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
nodded
his
head
in
my
direction
carelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
Merry
was
at
the
door
,
spitting
and
spluttering
over
some
*NL*
bad-tasted
medicine
;
but
at
the
first
word
of
the
doctor
's
proposal
he
*NL*
swung
round
with
a
deep
flush
and
cried
``
No
!
''
and
swore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
struck
the
barrel
with
his
open
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Si-lence
!
''
he
roared
and
looked
about
him
positively
like
a
lion
.
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
''
he
went
on
in
his
usual
tones
,
``
I
was
a-thinking
of
that
,
*NL*
knowing
as
how
you
had
a
fancy
for
the
boy
.
We
're
all
humbly
grateful
*NL*
for
your
kindness
,
and
as
you
see
,
puts
faith
in
you
and
takes
the
drugs
*NL*
down
like
that
much
grog
.
And
I
take
it
I
've
found
a
way
as
'll
suit
all
.
*NL*
Hawkins
,
will
you
give
me
your
word
of
honour
as
a
young
gentleman
--
for
*NL*
a
young
gentleman
you
are
,
although
poor
born
--
your
word
of
honour
not
*NL*
to
slip
your
cable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
readily
gave
the
pledge
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
doctor
,
''
said
Silver
,
``
you
just
step
outside
o
'
that
stockade
,
*NL*
and
once
you
're
there
I
'll
bring
the
boy
down
on
the
inside
,
and
I
*NL*
reckon
you
can
yarn
through
the
spars
.
Good
day
to
you
,
sir
,
and
all
our
*NL*
dooties
to
the
squire
and
Cap'n
Smollett
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
explosion
of
disapproval
,
which
nothing
but
Silver
's
black
looks
had
*NL*
restrained
,
broke
out
immediately
the
doctor
had
left
the
house
.
Silver
*NL*
was
roundly
accused
of
playing
double
--
of
trying
to
make
a
separate
*NL*
peace
for
himself
,
of
sacrificing
the
interests
of
his
accomplices
and
*NL*
victims
,
and
,
in
one
word
,
of
the
identical
,
exact
thing
that
he
was
*NL*
doing
.
It
seemed
to
me
so
obvious
,
in
this
case
,
that
I
could
not
*NL*
imagine
how
he
was
to
turn
their
anger
.
But
he
was
twice
the
man
*NL*
the
rest
were
,
and
his
last
night
's
victory
had
given
him
a
huge
*NL*
preponderance
on
their
minds
.
He
called
them
all
the
fools
and
dolts
*NL*
you
can
imagine
,
said
it
was
necessary
I
should
talk
to
the
doctor
,
*NL*
fluttered
the
chart
in
their
faces
,
asked
them
if
they
could
afford
to
*NL*
break
the
treaty
the
very
day
they
were
bound
a-treasure-hunting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
by
thunder
!
''
he
cried
.
``
It
's
us
must
break
the
treaty
when
the
time
*NL*
comes
;
and
till
then
I
'll
gammon
that
doctor
,
if
I
have
to
ile
his
boots
*NL*
with
brandy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
bade
them
get
the
fire
lit
,
and
stalked
out
upon
his
crutch
,
*NL*
with
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
,
leaving
them
in
a
disarray
,
and
silenced
*NL*
by
his
volubility
rather
than
convinced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Slow
,
lad
,
slow
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
might
round
upon
us
in
a
twinkle
of
an
*NL*
eye
if
we
was
seen
to
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Very
deliberately
,
then
,
did
we
advance
across
the
sand
to
where
the
*NL*
doctor
awaited
us
on
the
other
side
of
the
stockade
,
and
as
soon
as
we
*NL*
were
within
easy
speaking
distance
Silver
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
make
a
note
of
this
here
also
,
doctor
,
''
says
he
,
``
and
the
boy
'll
*NL*
tell
you
how
I
saved
his
life
,
and
were
deposed
for
it
too
,
and
you
*NL*
may
lay
to
that
.
Doctor
,
when
a
man
's
steering
as
near
the
wind
as
*NL*
me
--
playing
chuck-farthing
with
the
last
breath
in
his
body
,
like
--
you
*NL*
would
n't
think
it
too
much
,
mayhap
,
to
give
him
one
good
word
?
You
'll
*NL*
please
bear
in
mind
it
's
not
my
life
only
now
--
it
's
that
boy
's
into
the
*NL*
bargain
;
and
you
'll
speak
me
fair
,
doctor
,
and
give
me
a
bit
o
'
hope
to
*NL*
go
on
,
for
the
sake
of
mercy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
was
a
changed
man
once
he
was
out
there
and
had
his
back
to
his
*NL*
friends
and
the
block
house
;
his
cheeks
seemed
to
have
fallen
in
,
his
*NL*
voice
trembled
;
never
was
a
soul
more
dead
in
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
John
,
you
're
not
afraid
?
''
asked
Dr.
Livesey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
I
'm
no
coward
;
no
,
not
I
--
not
SO
much
!
''
and
he
snapped
his
*NL*
fingers
.
``
If
I
was
I
would
n't
say
it
.
But
I
'll
own
up
fairly
,
I
've
the
*NL*
shakes
upon
me
for
the
gallows
.
You
're
a
good
man
and
a
true
;
I
never
*NL*
seen
a
better
man
!
And
you
'll
not
forget
what
I
done
good
,
not
any
more
*NL*
than
you
'll
forget
the
bad
,
I
know
.
And
I
step
aside
--
see
here
--
and
*NL*
leave
you
and
Jim
alone
.
And
you
'll
put
that
down
for
me
too
,
for
it
's
a
*NL*
long
stretch
,
is
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
stepped
back
a
little
way
,
till
he
was
out
of
earshot
,
and
*NL*
there
sat
down
upon
a
tree-stump
and
began
to
whistle
,
spinning
round
*NL*
now
and
again
upon
his
seat
so
as
to
command
a
sight
,
sometimes
of
me
*NL*
and
the
doctor
and
sometimes
of
his
unruly
ruffians
as
they
went
to
and
*NL*
fro
in
the
sand
between
the
fire
--
which
they
were
busy
rekindling
--
and
*NL*
the
house
,
from
which
they
brought
forth
pork
and
bread
to
make
the
*NL*
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
Jim
,
''
said
the
doctor
sadly
,
``
here
you
are
.
As
you
have
brewed
,
so
*NL*
shall
you
drink
,
my
boy

Heaven
knows
,
I
can
not
find
it
in
my
heart
to
*NL*
blame
you
,
but
this
much
I
will
say
,
be
it
kind
or
unkind
:
when
Captain
*NL*
Smollett
was
well
,
you
dared
not
have
gone
off
;
and
when
he
was
ill
and
*NL*
could
n't
help
it
,
by
George
,
it
was
downright
cowardly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
own
that
I
here
began
to
weep
.
``
Doctor
,
''
I
said
,
``
you
might
spare
*NL*
me
.
I
have
blamed
myself
enough
;
my
life
's
forfeit
anyway
,
and
I
should
*NL*
have
been
dead
by
now
if
Silver
had
n't
stood
for
me
;
and
doctor
,
*NL*
believe
this
,
I
can
die
--
and
I
dare
say
I
deserve
it
--
but
what
I
fear
is
*NL*
torture
.
If
they
come
to
torture
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
,
''
the
doctor
interrupted
,
and
his
voice
was
quite
changed
,
``
Jim
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
have
this

Whip
over

and
we
'll
run
for

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
I
,
``
I
passed
my

*NL*
*NL*
``

he
cried
.
``

stay
here

*NL*
I
can
not

Jump

One

and
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
replied
;
``
you
know
right
well
you
would
n't
do
the
thing
*NL*
yourself
--
neither
you
nor
squire
nor
captain

and
no
more
will
I.
Silver
*NL*
trusted
me
;
I
passed
my
word
,
and
back
I
go
.
But
,
doctor
,
you
did
not
*NL*
let
me
finish
.
If
they
come
to
torture
me
,
I
might
let
slip
a
word
of
*NL*
where
the
ship
is
,
for
I
got
the
ship
,
part
by
luck
and
part
by
risking
,
*NL*
and
she
lies
in
North
Inlet
,
on
the
southern
beach
,
and
just
below
high
*NL*
water
.
At
half
tide
she
must
be
high
and
dry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ship
!
''
exclaimed
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rapidly
I
described
to
him
my
adventures
,
and
he
heard
me
out
in
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
kind
of
fate
in
this
,
''
he
observed
when
I
had
done
.
``
Every
*NL*
step
,
it
's
you
that
saves
our
lives
;
and
do
you
suppose
by
any
chance

that
we
are
going
to
let
you
lose
yours
?
That
would
be
a
poor
return

my
*NL*
boy

You
found
out

plot

you
found
Ben
Gunn

the
best
deed
that

ever
you
did

will
do

though
you
live
to
ninety

Oh

*NL*
talking
of
Ben
Gunn

Why

this
is
the
mischief
in
person

Silver

''
he
*NL*
cried
.
``
Silver
!
I
'll
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
,
''
he
continued
as
*NL*
the
cook
drew
near
again
;
``
do
n't
you
be
in
any
great
hurry
after
that
*NL*
treasure

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

sir

I
do
my
possible
,
which
that
ai

said
Silver
.
``
I
can
*NL*
only
,
asking
your
pardon
,
save
my
life
and
the
boy
's
by
seeking
for
that
*NL*
treasure
;
and
you
may
lay
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Silver
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
``
if
that
is
so
,
I
'll
go
one
step
*NL*
further
:
look
out
for
squalls
when
you
find
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Silver
,
``
as
between
man
and
man
,
that
's
too
much
and
too
*NL*
little
.
What
you
're
after

why
you
left
the
block
house
,
why
you
given
*NL*
me
that
there
chart

And
yet
I
done
your
*NL*
bidding
with
my
eyes
shut
and
never
a
word
of
hope
!
But
no
,
this
here
's
*NL*
too
much
.
If
you
wo
n't
tell
me
what
you
mean
plain
out
,
just
say
so
and
*NL*
I
'll
leave
the
helm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
doctor
musingly
;
``
I
've
no
right
to
say
more
;
it
's
not
my
*NL*
secret

you
see

or
,
I
give
you
my
word

I
'd
tell
it

But
*NL*
I
'll
go
as
far
with
you
as
I
dare
go
,
and
a
step
beyond
,
for
I
'll
have
*NL*
my
wig
sorted
by
the
captain
or
I
'm
mistaken
!
And
first
,
I
'll
give
you
a
*NL*
bit
of
hope
;
Silver
,
if
we
both
get
alive
out

wolf-trap

I
'll
do
*NL*
my
best
to
save
you

short
of
perjury

''
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
's
face
was
radiant
.
``
You
could
n't
say
more
,
I
'm
sure

not

he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
my
first
concession

added
the
doctor
.
``
My
second
is
a

piece

advice

keep

close
beside
you

and
when
you
need
help
,
*NL*
halloo
.
I
'm
off
to
seek
it
for
you

and
that
itself
will
show
you
if
I
*NL*
speak
at
random

Good-bye

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Dr.
Livesey
shook
hands
with
me
through
the
stockade
,
nodded
to
*NL*
Silver
,
and
set
off
at
a
brisk
pace
into
the
wood

31
*NL*
*NL*
The
Treasure-hunt
--
Flint
's
Pointer
*NL*
*NL*
``
JIM
,
''
said
Silver
when
we
were
alone
,
``
if
I
saved
your
life
,
you
saved
*NL*
mine
;
and
I
'll
not
forget
it
.
I
seen
the
doctor
waving
you
to
run
for
*NL*
it
--
with
the
tail
of
my
eye
,
I
did
;
and
I
seen
you
say
no
,
as
plain
as
*NL*
hearing
.
Jim
,
that
's
one
to
you
.
This
is
the
first
glint
of
hope
I
had
*NL*
since
the
attack
failed
,
and
I
owe
it
you
.
And
now
,
Jim
,
we
're
to
go
in
*NL*
for
this
here
treasure-hunting
,
with
sealed
orders
too
,
and
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
it
;
and
you
and
me
must
stick
close
,
back
to
back
like
,
and
we
'll
save
*NL*
our
necks
in
spite
o
'
fate
and
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
a
man
hailed
us
from
the
fire
that
breakfast
was
ready
,
and
*NL*
we
were
soon
seated
here
and
there
about
the
sand
over
biscuit
and
fried
*NL*
junk
.
They
had
lit
a
fire
fit
to
roast
an
ox
,
and
it
was
now
grown
so
*NL*
hot
that
they
could
only
approach
it
from
the
windward
,
and
even
there
*NL*
not
without
precaution
.
In
the
same
wasteful
spirit
,
they
had
cooked
,
*NL*
I
suppose
,
three
times
more
than
we
could
eat
;
and
one
of
them
,
with
an
*NL*
empty
laugh
,
threw
what
was
left
into
the
fire
,
which
blazed
and
roared
*NL*
again
over
this
unusual
fuel
.
I
never
in
my
life
saw
men
so
careless
of
*NL*
the
morrow
;
hand
to
mouth
is
the
only
word
that
can
describe
their
way
*NL*
of
doing
;
and
what
with
wasted
food
and
sleeping
sentries
,
though
they
*NL*
were
bold
enough
for
a
brush
and
be
done
with
it
,
I
could
see
their
*NL*
entire
unfitness
for
anything
like
a
prolonged
campaign
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Silver
,
eating
away
,
with
Captain
Flint
upon
his
shoulder
,
had
not
*NL*
a
word
of
blame
for
their
recklessness
.
And
this
the
more
surprised
me
,
*NL*
for
I
thought
he
had
never
shown
himself
so
cunning
as
he
did
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
mates
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
's
lucky
you
have
Barbecue
to
think
for
you
*NL*
with
this
here
head
.
I
got
what
I
wanted
,
I
did
.
Sure
enough
,
they
have
*NL*
the
ship
.
Where
they
have
it
,
I
do
n't
know
yet
;
but
once
we
hit
the
*NL*
treasure
,
we
'll
have
to
jump
about
and
find
out
.
And
then
,
mates
,
us
*NL*
that
has
the
boats
,
I
reckon
,
has
the
upper
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
kept
running
on
,
with
his
mouth
full
of
the
hot
bacon
;
thus
he
*NL*
restored
their
hope
and
confidence
,
and
,
I
more
than
suspect
,
repaired
*NL*
his
own
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
hostage
,
''
he
continued
,
``
that
's
his
last
talk
,
I
guess
,
with
*NL*
them
he
loves
so
dear
.
I
've
got
my
piece
o
'
news
,
and
thanky
to
him
*NL*
for
that
;
but
it
's
over
and
done
.
I
'll
take
him
in
a
line
when
we
go
*NL*
treasure-hunting
,
for
we
'll
keep
him
like
so
much
gold
,
in
case
of
*NL*
accidents
,
you
mark
,
and
in
the
meantime
.
Once
we
got
the
ship
and
*NL*
treasure
both
and
off
to
sea
like
jolly
companions
,
why
then
we
'll
talk
*NL*
Mr.
Hawkins
over
,
we
will
,
and
we
'll
give
him
his
share
,
to
be
sure
,
for
*NL*
all
his
kindness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
wonder
the
men
were
in
a
good
humour
now
.
For
my
part
,
I
*NL*
was
horribly
cast
down
.
Should
the
scheme
he
had
now
sketched
prove
*NL*
feasible
,
Silver
,
already
doubly
a
traitor
,
would
not
hesitate
to
adopt
*NL*
it
.
He
had
still
a
foot
in
either
camp
,
and
there
was
no
doubt
he
*NL*
would
prefer
wealth
and
freedom
with
the
pirates
to
a
bare
escape
from
*NL*
hanging
,
which
was
the
best
he
had
to
hope
on
our
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nay
,
and
even
if
things
so
fell
out
that
he
was
forced
to
keep
his
faith
*NL*
with
Dr.
Livesey
,
even
then
what
danger
lay
before
us
!
What
a
moment
*NL*
that
would
be
when
the
suspicions
of
his
followers
turned
to
certainty
*NL*
and
he
and
I
should
have
to
fight
for
dear
life
--
he
a
cripple
and
I
a
*NL*
boy
--
against
five
strong
and
active
seamen
!
*NL*
*NL*
Add
to
this
double
apprehension
the
mystery
that
still
hung
over
the
*NL*
behaviour
of
my
friends
,
their
unexplained
desertion
of
the
stockade
,
*NL*
their
inexplicable
cession
of
the
chart
,
or
harder
still
to
understand
,
*NL*
the
doctor
's
last
warning
to
Silver
,
``
Look
out
for
squalls
when
you
*NL*
find
it
,
''
and
you
will
readily
believe
how
little
taste
I
found
in
my
*NL*
breakfast
and
with
how
uneasy
a
heart
I
set
forth
behind
my
captors
on
*NL*
the
quest
for
treasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
made
a
curious
figure
,
had
anyone
been
there
to
see
us
--
all
in
soiled
*NL*
sailor
clothes
and
all
but
me
armed
to
the
teeth
.
Silver
had
two
guns
*NL*
slung
about
him
--
one
before
and
one
behind
--
besides
the
great
cutlass
*NL*
at
his
waist
and
a
pistol
in
each
pocket
of
his
square-tailed
coat
.
*NL*
To
complete
his
strange
appearance
,
Captain
Flint
sat
perched
upon
his
*NL*
shoulder
and
gabbling
odds
and
ends
of
purposeless
sea-talk
.
I
had
a
*NL*
line
about
my
waist
and
followed
obediently
after
the
sea-cook
,
who
*NL*
held
the
loose
end
of
the
rope
,
now
in
his
free
hand
,
now
between
his
*NL*
powerful
teeth
.
For
all
the
world
,
I
was
led
like
a
dancing
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
men
were
variously
burthened
,
some
carrying
picks
and
*NL*
shovels
--
for
that
had
been
the
very
first
necessary
they
brought
ashore
*NL*
from
the
HISPANIOLA
--
others
laden
with
pork
,
bread
,
and
brandy
for
the
*NL*
midday
meal
.
All
the
stores
,
I
observed
,
came
from
our
stock
,
and
I
*NL*
could
see
the
truth
of
Silver
's
words
the
night
before
.
Had
he
not
*NL*
struck
a
bargain
with
the
doctor
,
he
and
his
mutineers
,
deserted
by
the
*NL*
ship
,
must
have
been
driven
to
subsist
on
clear
water
and
the
proceeds
*NL*
of
their
hunting
.
Water
would
have
been
little
to
their
taste
;
a
sailor
*NL*
is
not
usually
a
good
shot
;
and
besides
all
that
,
when
they
were
so
*NL*
short
of
eatables
,
it
was
not
likely
they
would
be
very
flush
of
powder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
thus
equipped
,
we
all
set
out
--
even
the
fellow
with
the
broken
*NL*
head
,
who
should
certainly
have
kept
in
shadow
--
and
straggled
,
one
after
*NL*
another
,
to
the
beach
,
where
the
two
gigs
awaited
us
.
Even
these
bore
*NL*
trace
of
the
drunken
folly
of
the
pirates
,
one
in
a
broken
thwart
,
and
*NL*
both
in
their
muddy
and
unbailed
condition
.
Both
were
to
be
carried
*NL*
along
with
us
for
the
sake
of
safety
;
and
so
,
with
our
numbers
divided
*NL*
between
them
,
we
set
forth
upon
the
bosom
of
the
anchorage
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
pulled
over
,
there
was
some
discussion
on
the
chart
.
The
red
cross
*NL*
was
,
of
course
,
far
too
large
to
be
a
guide
;
and
the
terms
of
the
note
*NL*
on
the
back
,
as
you
will
hear
,
admitted
of
some
ambiguity
.
They
ran
,
the
*NL*
reader
may
remember
,
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
Tall
tree
,
Spy-glass
shoulder
,
bearing
a
point
to
*NL*
the
N.
of
N.N.E.
*NL*
Skeleton
Island
E.S.E.
and
by
E.
*NL*
Ten
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
tree
was
thus
the
principal
mark
.
Now
,
right
before
us
the
*NL*
anchorage
was
bounded
by
a
plateau
from
two
to
three
hundred
feet
high
,
*NL*
adjoining
on
the
north
the
sloping
southern
shoulder
of
the
Spy-glass
*NL*
and
rising
again
towards
the
south
into
the
rough
,
cliffy
eminence
*NL*
called
the
Mizzen-mast
Hill
.
The
top
of
the
plateau
was
dotted
thickly
*NL*
with
pine-trees
of
varying
height
.
Every
here
and
there
,
one
of
a
*NL*
different
species
rose
forty
or
fifty
feet
clear
above
its
neighbours
,
*NL*
and
which
of
these
was
the
particular
``
tall
tree
''
of
Captain
Flint
could
*NL*
only
be
decided
on
the
spot
,
and
by
the
readings
of
the
compass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
,
although
that
was
the
case
,
every
man
on
board
the
boats
had
*NL*
picked
a
favourite
of
his
own
ere
we
were
half-way
over
,
Long
John
alone
*NL*
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
bidding
them
wait
till
they
were
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
pulled
easily
,
by
Silver
's
directions
,
not
to
weary
the
hands
*NL*
prematurely
,
and
after
quite
a
long
passage
,
landed
at
the
mouth
of
*NL*
the
second
river
--
that
which
runs
down
a
woody
cleft
of
the
Spy-glass
.
*NL*
Thence
,
bending
to
our
left
,
we
began
to
ascend
the
slope
towards
the
*NL*
plateau
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
first
outset
,
heavy
,
miry
ground
and
a
matted
,
marish
vegetation
*NL*
greatly
delayed
our
progress
;
but
by
little
and
little
the
hill
began
*NL*
to
steepen
and
become
stony
under
foot
,
and
the
wood
to
change
its
*NL*
character
and
to
grow
in
a
more
open
order
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
most
*NL*
pleasant
portion
of
the
island
that
we
were
now
approaching
.
A
*NL*
heavy-scented
broom
and
many
flowering
shrubs
had
almost
taken
the
place
*NL*
of
grass
.
Thickets
of
green
nutmeg-trees
were
dotted
here
and
there
with
*NL*
the
red
columns
and
the
broad
shadow
of
the
pines
;
and
the
first
mingled
*NL*
their
spice
with
the
aroma
of
the
others
.
The
air
,
besides
,
was
fresh
*NL*
and
stirring
,
and
this
,
under
the
sheer
sunbeams
,
was
a
wonderful
*NL*
refreshment
to
our
senses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
spread
itself
abroad
,
in
a
fan
shape
,
shouting
and
leaping
to
*NL*
and
fro
.
About
the
centre
,
and
a
good
way
behind
the
rest
,
Silver
and
*NL*
I
followed
--
I
tethered
by
my
rope
,
he
ploughing
,
with
deep
pants
,
among
*NL*
the
sliding
gravel
.
From
time
to
time
,
indeed
,
I
had
to
lend
him
a
hand
,
*NL*
or
he
must
have
missed
his
footing
and
fallen
backward
down
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
thus
proceeded
for
about
half
a
mile
and
were
approaching
the
*NL*
brow
of
the
plateau
when
the
man
upon
the
farthest
left
began
to
cry
*NL*
aloud
,
as
if
in
terror
.
Shout
after
shout
came
from
him
,
and
the
others
*NL*
began
to
run
in
his
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
ca
n't
'
a
found
the
treasure
,
''
said
old
Morgan
,
hurrying
past
us
from
*NL*
the
right
,
``
for
that
's
clean
a-top
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
as
we
found
when
we
also
reached
the
spot
,
it
was
something
*NL*
very
different
.
At
the
foot
of
a
pretty
big
pine
and
involved
in
a
green
*NL*
creeper
,
which
had
even
partly
lifted
some
of
the
smaller
bones
,
a
human
*NL*
skeleton
lay
,
with
a
few
shreds
of
clothing
,
on
the
ground
.
I
believe
a
*NL*
chill
struck
for
a
moment
to
every
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
seaman
,
''
said
George
Merry
,
who
,
bolder
than
the
rest
,
had
*NL*
gone
up
close
and
was
examining
the
rags
of
clothing
.
``
Leastways
,
this
*NL*
is
good
sea-cloth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
said
Silver
;
``
like
enough
;
you
would
n't
look
to
find
a
*NL*
bishop
here
,
I
reckon
.
But
what
sort
of
a
way
is
that
for
bones
to
lie
?
*NL*
`
Tai
n't
in
natur
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
on
a
second
glance
,
it
seemed
impossible
to
fancy
that
the
body
*NL*
was
in
a
natural
position
.
But
for
some
disarray
-LRB-
the
work
,
perhaps
,
of
*NL*
the
birds
that
had
fed
upon
him
or
of
the
slow-growing
creeper
that
had
*NL*
gradually
enveloped
his
remains
-RRB-
the
man
lay
perfectly
straight
--
his
*NL*
feet
pointing
in
one
direction
,
his
hands
,
raised
above
his
head
like
a
*NL*
diver
's
,
pointing
directly
in
the
opposite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
taken
a
notion
into
my
old
numbskull
,
''
observed
Silver
.
``
Here
's
*NL*
the
compass
;
there
's
the
tip-top
p
`
int
o
'
Skeleton
Island
,
stickin
'
*NL*
out
like
a
tooth
.
Just
take
a
bearing
,
will
you
,
along
the
line
of
them
*NL*
bones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
done
.
The
body
pointed
straight
in
the
direction
of
the
island
,
*NL*
and
the
compass
read
duly
E.S.E.
and
by
E.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
,
''
cried
the
cook
;
``
this
here
is
a
p
`
inter

Right
up
there
*NL*
is
our
line
for
the
Pole
Star
and
the
jolly
dollars
.
But
,
by
thunder
!
*NL*
If
it
do
n't
make
me
cold
inside
to
think
of
Flint
.
This
is
one
of
HIS
*NL*
jokes
,
and
no
mistake
.
Him
and
these
six
was
alone
here
;
he
killed
'em
,
*NL*
every
man
;
and
this
one
he
hauled
here
and
laid
down
by
compass
,
shiver
*NL*
my
timbers
!
They
're
long
bones
,
and
the
hair
's
been
yellow
.
Aye
,
that
*NL*
would
be
Allardyce
.
You
mind
Allardyce
,
Tom
Morgan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
aye
,
''
returned
Morgan
;
``
I
mind
him
;
he
owed
me
money
,
he
did
,
and
*NL*
took
my
knife
ashore
with
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speaking
of
knives
,
''
said
another
,
``
why
do
n't
we
find
his

lying

round

Flint

n't
the
man
to
pick
a
seaman

pocket

the
birds

I
*NL*
guess

would
leave
it
be

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
powers
,

that
's
true
!
''
cried
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
ai
n't
a
thing
left
here
,
''
said
Merry
,
still
feeling
round
among
*NL*
the
bones
;
``
not
a
copper
doit
nor
a
baccy
box

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

agreed
Silver
;
``
not

*NL*
you

Great
guns

Messmates

Flint
was
living

this
would
be
a
hot

spot

Six

bones

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
him
dead
with
these
here
deadlights

said
Morgan
.
``
Billy
took
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dead

enough

gone

said
the
fellow
with

the
bandage
;
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

observed
another
;

raged

now
he

were
his
only
song

*NL*

I
tell
you
true

I
never
rightly
liked
to
hear
it

hot

the
windy
was
open

I
hear
that

song
comin

out

clear

clear

the
death-haul
on
the
man
already

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

come

said
Silver
;
``
stow
this
talk

*NL*
*NL*
We
started
,
certainly
;
but
in
spite
of
the
hot
sun
and
the
staring
*NL*
daylight
,
the
pirates
no
longer
ran
separate
and
shouting
through
the
*NL*
wood
,
but
kept
side
by
side
and
spoke
with
bated
breath
.
The
terror
of
*NL*
the
dead
buccaneer
had
fallen
on
their
spirits
.

The
Treasure-hunt
--
The
Voice
Among
the
Trees
*NL*
*NL*
PARTLY
from
the
damping
influence
of
this
alarm
,
partly
to
rest
Silver
*NL*
and
the
sick
folk
,
the
whole
party
sat
down
as
soon
as
they
had
gained
*NL*
the
brow
of
the
ascent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
plateau
being
somewhat
tilted
towards
the
west
,
this
spot
on
which
*NL*
we
had
paused
commanded
a
wide
prospect
on
either
hand
.
Before
us
,
*NL*
over
the
tree-tops
,
we
beheld
the
Cape
of
the
Woods
fringed
with
surf
;
*NL*
behind
,
we
not
only
looked
down
upon
the
anchorage
and
Skeleton
Island
,
*NL*
but
saw
--
clear
across
the
spit
and
the
eastern
lowlands
--
a
great
field
*NL*
of
open
sea
upon
the
east
.
Sheer
above
us
rose
the
Spyglass
,
here
dotted
*NL*
with
single
pines
,
there
black
with
precipices
.
There
was
no
sound
but
*NL*
that
of
the
distant
breakers
,
mounting
from
all
round
,
and
the
chirp
of
*NL*
countless
insects
in
the
brush
.
Not
a
man
,
not
a
sail
,
upon
the
sea
;
the
*NL*
very
largeness
of
the
view
increased
the
sense
of
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
,
as
he
sat
,
took
certain
bearings
with
his
compass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
three
`
tall
trees
'
''
said
he
,
``
about
in
the
right
line
from
*NL*
Skeleton
Island
.
`
Spy-glass
shoulder
,
'
I
take
it
,
means
that
lower
p
`
int
*NL*
there
.
It
's
child
's
play
to
find
the
stuff
now
.
I
've
half
a
mind
to
dine
*NL*
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
feel
sharp
,
''
growled
Morgan
.
``
Thinkin
'
o
'
Flint
--
I
think
it
*NL*
were
--
as
done
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
my
son
,
you
praise
your
stars
he
's
dead
,
''
said
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
were
an
ugly
devil
,
''
cried
a
third
pirate
with
a
shudder
;
``
that
blue
*NL*
in
the
face
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
how
the
rum
took
him
,
''
added
Merry
.
``
Blue
!
Well
,
I
reckon
he
*NL*
was
blue
.
That
's
a
true
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ever
since
they
had
found
the
skeleton
and
got
upon
this
train
of
*NL*
thought
,
they
had
spoken
lower
and
lower
,
and
they
had
almost
got
to
*NL*
whispering
by
now
,
so
that
the
sound
of
their
talk
hardly
interrupted
*NL*
the
silence
of
the
wood
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
out
of
the
middle
of
the
trees
*NL*
in
front
of
us
,
a
thin
,
high
,
trembling
voice
struck
up
the
well-known
*NL*
air
and
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
men
on
the
dead
man
's
chest
--
*NL*
Yo-ho-ho
,
and
a
bottle
of
rum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
have
seen
men
more
dreadfully
affected
than
the
pirates
.
The
*NL*
colour
went
from
their
six
faces
like
enchantment
;
some
leaped
to
their
*NL*
feet
,
some
clawed
hold
of
others
;
Morgan
grovelled
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Flint
,
by
--
!
''
cried
Merry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
song
had
stopped
as
suddenly
as
it
began
--
broken
off
,
you
would
have
*NL*
said
,
in
the
middle
of
a
note
,
as
though
someone
had
laid
his
hand
upon
*NL*
the
singer
's
mouth
.
Coming
through
the
clear
,
sunny
atmosphere
among
the
*NL*
green
tree-tops
,
I
thought
it
had
sounded
airily
and
sweetly
;
and
the
*NL*
effect
on
my
companions
was
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Silver
,
struggling
with
his
ashen
lips
to
get
the
word
out
;
*NL*
``
this
wo
n't
do
.
Stand
by
to
go
about
.
This
is
a
rum
start
,
and
I
ca
n't
*NL*
name
the
voice
,
but
it
's
someone
skylarking
--
someone
that
's
flesh
and
*NL*
blood
,
and
you
may
lay
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
courage
had
come
back
as
he
spoke
,
and
some
of
the
colour
to
his
*NL*
face
along
with
it
.
Already
the
others
had
begun
to
lend
an
ear
to
this
*NL*
encouragement
and
were
coming
a
little
to
themselves
,
when
the
same
*NL*
voice
broke
out
again
--
not
this
time
singing
,
but
in
a
faint
distant
*NL*
hail
that
echoed
yet
fainter
among
the
clefts
of
the
Spy-glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Darby
M'Graw
,
''
it
wailed
--
for
that
is
the
word
that
best
describes
the
*NL*
sound
--
``
Darby
M'Graw
!
Darby
M'Graw
!
''
again
and
again
and
again
;
and
then
*NL*
rising
a
little
higher
,
and
with
an
oath
that
I
leave
out
:
``
Fetch
aft
*NL*
the
rum
,
Darby
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
buccaneers
remained
rooted
to
the
ground
,
their
eyes
starting
from
*NL*
their
heads
.
Long
after
the
voice
had
died
away
they
still
stared
in
*NL*
silence
,
dreadfully
,
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
fixes
it
!
''
gasped
one
.
``
Let
's
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
was
his
last
words
,
''
moaned
Morgan
,
``
his
last
words
above
board
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dick
had
his
Bible
out
and
was
praying
volubly
.
He
had
been
well
brought
*NL*
up
,
had
Dick
,
before
he
came
to
sea
and
fell
among
bad
companions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
Silver
was
unconquered
.
I
could
hear
his
teeth
rattle
in
his
head
,
*NL*
but
he
had
not
yet
surrendered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
in
this
here
island
ever
heard
of
Darby
,
''
he
muttered
;
``
not
one
*NL*
but
us
that
's
here
.
''
And
then
,
making
a
great
effort
:
``
Shipmates
,
''
*NL*
he
cried
,
``
I
'm
here
to
get
that
stuff
,
and
I
'll
not
be
beat
by
man
or
*NL*
devil
.
I
never
was
feared
of
Flint
in
his
life
,
and
,
by
the
powers
,
I
'll
*NL*
face
him
dead
.
There
's
seven
hundred
thousand
pound
not
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
mile
from
here
.
When
did
ever
a
gentleman
o
'
fortune
show
his
stern
to
*NL*
that
much
dollars
for
a
boozy
old
seaman
with
a
blue
mug
--
and
him
dead
*NL*
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
sign
of
reawakening
courage
in
his
followers
,
rather
,
*NL*
indeed
,
of
growing
terror
at
the
irreverence
of
his
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Belay
there
,
John
!
''
said
Merry
.
``
Do
n't
you
cross
a
sperrit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
rest
were
all
too
terrified
to
reply
.
They
would
have
run
away
*NL*
severally
had
they
dared
;
but
fear
kept
them
together
,
and
kept
them
*NL*
close
by
John
,
as
if
his
daring
helped
them
.
He
,
on
his
part
,
had
pretty
*NL*
well
fought
his
weakness
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sperrit
?
Well
,
maybe
,
''
he
said
.
``
But
there
's
one
thing
not
clear
to
me
.
*NL*
There
was
an
echo
.
Now
,
no
man
ever
seen
a
sperrit
with
a
shadow
;
well
*NL*
then
,
what
's
he
doing
with
an
echo
to
him
,
I
should
like
to
know
?
That
*NL*
ai
n't
in
natur
'
,
surely
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
argument
seemed
weak
enough
to
me
.
But
you
can
never
tell
what
will
*NL*
affect
the
superstitious
,
and
to
my
wonder
,
George
Merry
was
greatly
*NL*
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
so
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
've
a
head
upon
your
shoulders
,
John
,
*NL*
and
no
mistake
.
`
Bout

This
here
crew
is
on
a
wrong
tack

I
*NL*
do
believe

And
come
to
think
on
it
,
it
was
like
Flint
's
voice
,
I
*NL*
grant
you
,
but
not
just
so
clear-away
like
it
,
after
all
.
It
was
liker
*NL*
somebody
else
's
voice
now
--
it
was
liker
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
powers
,
Ben
Gunn
!
''
roared
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
and
so
it
were
,
''
cried
Morgan
,
springing
on
his
knees
.
``
Ben
Gunn
*NL*
it
were
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
do
n't
make
much
odds
,
do
it
,
now
?
''
asked
Dick
.
``
Ben
Gunn
's
not
here
*NL*
in
the
body
any
more
'n
Flint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
older
hands
greeted
this
remark
with
scorn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
nobody
minds
Ben
Gunn
,
''
cried
Merry
;
``
dead
or
alive
,
nobody
minds
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
extraordinary
how
their
spirits
had
returned
and
how
the
natural
*NL*
colour
had
revived
in
their
faces
.
Soon
they
were
chatting
together
,
*NL*
with
intervals
of
listening
;
and
not
long
after
,
hearing
no
further
*NL*
sound
,
they
shouldered
the
tools
and
set
forth
again
,
Merry
walking
*NL*
first
with
Silver
's
compass
to
keep
them
on
the
right
line
with
Skeleton
*NL*
Island
.
He
had
said
the
truth
:
dead
or
alive
,
nobody
minded
Ben
Gunn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dick
alone
still
held
his
Bible
,
and
looked
around
him
as
he
went
,
with
*NL*
fearful
glances
;
but
he
found
no
sympathy
,
and
Silver
even
joked
him
on
*NL*
his
precautions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
,
''
said
he
--
``
I
told
you
you
had
sp
`
iled
your
Bible
.
If
it
*NL*
ai
n't
no
good
to
swear
by
,
what
do
you
suppose
a
sperrit
would
give
for
*NL*
it
?
Not
that
!
''
and
he
snapped
his
big
fingers
,
halting
a
moment
on
his
*NL*
crutch
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Dick
was
not
to
be
comforted
;
indeed
,
it
was
soon
plain
to
me
that
*NL*
the
lad
was
falling
sick
;
hastened
by
heat
,
exhaustion
,
and
the
shock
*NL*
of
his
alarm
,
the
fever
,
predicted
by
Dr.
Livesey
,
was
evidently
growing
*NL*
swiftly
higher
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
fine
open
walking
here
,
upon
the
summit
;
our
way
lay
a
little
*NL*
downhill
,
for
,
as
I
have
said
,
the
plateau
tilted
towards
the
west
.
The
*NL*
pines
,
great
and
small
,
grew
wide
apart
;
and
even
between
the
clumps
of
*NL*
nutmeg
and
azalea
,
wide
open
spaces
baked
in
the
hot
sunshine
.
Striking
,
*NL*
as
we
did
,
pretty
near
north-west
across
the
island
,
we
drew
,
on
the
*NL*
one
hand
,
ever
nearer
under
the
shoulders
of
the
Spy-glass
,
and
on
the
*NL*
other
,
looked
ever
wider
over
that
western
bay
where
I
had
once
tossed
*NL*
and
trembled
in
the
coracle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
of
the
tall
trees
was
reached
,
and
by
the
bearings
proved
the
*NL*
wrong
one
.
So
with
the
second
.
The
third
rose
nearly
two
hundred
feet
*NL*
into
the
air
above
a
clump
of
underwood
--
a
giant
of
a
vegetable
,
with
*NL*
a
red
column
as
big
as
a
cottage
,
and
a
wide
shadow
around
in
which
a
*NL*
company
could
have
manoeuvred
.
It
was
conspicuous
far
to
sea
both
on
*NL*
the
east
and
west
and
might
have
been
entered
as
a
sailing
mark
upon
the
*NL*
chart
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
not
its
size
that
now
impressed
my
companions
;
it
was
the
*NL*
knowledge
that
seven
hundred
thousand
pounds
in
gold
lay
somewhere
*NL*
buried
below
its
spreading
shadow
.
The
thought
of
the
money
,
as
they
*NL*
drew
nearer
,
swallowed
up
their
previous
terrors
.
Their
eyes
burned
in
*NL*
their
heads
;
their
feet
grew
speedier
and
lighter
;
their
whole
soul
*NL*
was
bound
up
in
that
fortune
,
that
whole
lifetime
of
extravagance
and
*NL*
pleasure
,
that
lay
waiting
there
for
each
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
hobbled
,
grunting
,
on
his
crutch
;
his
nostrils
stood
out
and
*NL*
quivered
;
he
cursed
like
a
madman
when
the
flies
settled
on
his
hot
and
*NL*
shiny
countenance
;
he
plucked
furiously
at
the
line
that
held
me
to
*NL*
him
and
from
time
to
time
turned
his
eyes
upon
me
with
a
deadly
look
.
*NL*
Certainly
he
took
no
pains
to
hide
his
thoughts
,
and
certainly
I
read
*NL*
them
like
print
.
In
the
immediate
nearness
of
the
gold
,
all
else
had
*NL*
been
forgotten
:
his
promise
and
the
doctor
's
warning
were
both
things
*NL*
of
the
past
,
and
I
could
not
doubt
that
he
hoped
to
seize
upon
the
*NL*
treasure
,
find
and
board
the
HISPANIOLA
under
cover
of
night
,
cut
*NL*
every
honest
throat
about
that
island
,
and
sail
away
as
he
had
at
first
*NL*
intended
,
laden
with
crimes
and
riches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shaken
as
I
was
with
these
alarms
,
it
was
hard
for
me
to
keep
up
with
*NL*
the
rapid
pace
of
the
treasure-hunters
.
Now
and
again
I
stumbled
,
and
it
*NL*
was
then
that
Silver
plucked
so
roughly
at
the
rope
and
launched
at
me
*NL*
his
murderous
glances
.
Dick
,
who
had
dropped
behind
us
and
now
brought
*NL*
up
the
rear
,
was
babbling
to
himself
both
prayers
and
curses
as
his
*NL*
fever
kept
rising
.
This
also
added
to
my
wretchedness
,
and
to
crown
all
,
*NL*
I
was
haunted
by
the
thought
of
the
tragedy
that
had
once
been
acted
*NL*
on
that
plateau
,
when
that
ungodly
buccaneer
with
the
blue
face
--
he
who
*NL*
died
at
Savannah
,
singing
and
shouting
for
drink
--
had
there
,
with
his
*NL*
own
hand
,
cut
down
his
six
accomplices
.
This
grove
that
was
now
so
*NL*
peaceful
must
then
have
rung
with
cries
,
I
thought
;
and
even
with
the
*NL*
thought
I
could
believe
I
heard
it
ringing
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
now
at
the
margin
of
the
thicket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huzza
,
mates
,
all
together
!
''
shouted
Merry
;
and
the
foremost
broke
into
*NL*
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
suddenly
,
not
ten
yards
further
,
we
beheld
them
stop
.
A
low
cry
*NL*
arose
.
Silver
doubled
his
pace
,
digging
away
with
the
foot
of
his
crutch
*NL*
like
one
possessed
;
and
next
moment
he
and
I
had
come
also
to
a
dead
*NL*
halt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
us
was
a
great
excavation
,
not
very
recent
,
for
the
sides
had
*NL*
fallen
in
and
grass
had
sprouted
on
the
bottom
.
In
this
were
the
shaft
*NL*
of
a
pick
broken
in
two
and
the
boards
of
several
packing-cases
strewn
*NL*
around
.
On
one
of
these
boards
I
saw
,
branded
with
a
hot
iron
,
the
name
*NL*
WALRUS
--
the
name
of
Flint
's
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
clear
to
probation
.
The
CACHE
had
been
found
and
rifled
;
the
*NL*
seven
hundred
thousand
pounds
were
gone
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
33
*NL*
*NL*
The
Fall
of
a
Chieftain
*NL*
*NL*
THERE
never
was
such
an
overturn
in
this
world
.
Each
of
these
six
men
*NL*
was
as
though
he
had
been
struck
.
But
with
Silver
the
blow
passed
almost
*NL*
instantly
.
Every
thought
of
his
soul
had
been
set
full-stretch
,
like
a
*NL*
racer
,
on
that
money
;
well
,
he
was
brought
up
,
in
a
single
second
,
dead
;
*NL*
and
he
kept
his
head
,
found
his
temper
,
and
changed
his
plan
before
the
*NL*
others
had
had
time
to
realize
the
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jim
,
''
he
whispered
,
``
take
that
,
and
stand
by
for
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
passed
me
a
double-barrelled
pistol
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
he
began
quietly
moving
northward
,
and
in
a
few
steps
*NL*
had
put
the
hollow
between
us
two
and
the
other
five
.
Then
he
looked
at
*NL*
me
and
nodded
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
``
Here
is
a
narrow
corner
,
''
as
,
indeed
,
*NL*
I
thought
it
was
.
His
looks
were
not
quite
friendly
,
and
I
was
so
*NL*
revolted
at
these
constant
changes
that
I
could
not
forbear
whispering
,
*NL*
``
So
you
've
changed
sides
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
time
left
for
him
to
answer
in
.
The
buccaneers
,
with
oaths
*NL*
and
cries
,
began
to
leap
,
one
after
another
,
into
the
pit
and
to
dig
*NL*
with
their
fingers
,
throwing
the
boards
aside
as
they
did
so
.
Morgan
*NL*
found
a
piece
of
gold
.
He
held
it
up
with
a
perfect
spout
of
oaths
.
It
*NL*
was
a
two-guinea
piece
,
and
it
went
from
hand
to
hand
among
them
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
guineas
!
''
roared
Merry
,
shaking
it
at
Silver
.
``
That
's
your
seven
*NL*
hundred
thousand
pounds
,
is
it
?
You
're
the
man
for
bargains
,
ai
n't
you
?
*NL*
You
're
him
that
never
bungled
nothing
,
you
wooden-headed
lubber
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dig
away
,
boys
,
''
said
Silver
with
the
coolest
insolence
;
``
you
'll
find
*NL*
some
pig-nuts
and
I
should
n't
wonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pig-nuts
!
''
repeated
Merry
,
in
a
scream
.
``
Mates
,
do
you
hear
that
?
I
*NL*
tell
you
now
,
that
man
there
knew
it
all
along
.
Look
in
the
face
of
him
*NL*
and
you
'll
see
it
wrote
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Merry
,
''
remarked
Silver
,
``
standing
for
cap'n
again
?
You
're
a
*NL*
pushing
lad
,
to
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
time
everyone
was
entirely
in
Merry
's
favour
.
They
began
to
*NL*
scramble
out
of
the
excavation
,
darting
furious
glances
behind
them
.
One
*NL*
thing
I
observed
,
which
looked
well
for
us
:
they
all
got
out
upon
the
*NL*
opposite
side
from
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
there
we
stood
,
two
on
one
side
,
five
on
the
other
,
the
pit
*NL*
between
us
,
and
nobody
screwed
up
high
enough
to
offer
the
first
blow
.
*NL*
Silver
never
moved
;
he
watched
them
,
very
upright
on
his
crutch
,
and
*NL*
looked
as
cool
as
ever
I
saw
him
.
He
was
brave
,
and
no
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Merry
seemed
to
think
a
speech
might
help
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mates
,
''
says
he
,
``
there
's
two
of
them
alone
there
;
one
's
the
old
*NL*
cripple
that
brought
us
all
here
and
blundered
us
down
to
this
;
the
*NL*
other
's
that
cub
that
I
mean
to
have
the
heart
of
.
Now
,
mates
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
raising
his
arm
and
his
voice
,
and
plainly
meant
to
lead
a
*NL*
charge
.
But
just
then
--
crack
!
crack
!
crack
!
--
three
musket-shots
flashed
*NL*
out
of
the
thicket
.
Merry
tumbled
head
foremost
into
the
excavation
;
the
*NL*
man
with
the
bandage
spun
round
like
a
teetotum
and
fell
all
his
length
*NL*
upon
his
side
,
where
he
lay
dead
,
but
still
twitching
;
and
the
other
*NL*
three
turned
and
ran
for
it
with
all
their
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
you
could
wink
,
Long
John
had
fired
two
barrels
of
a
pistol
into
*NL*
the
struggling
Merry
,
and
as
the
man
rolled
up
his
eyes
at
him
in
the
*NL*
last
agony
,
``
George
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
reckon
I
settled
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
,
the
doctor
,
Gray
,
and
Ben
Gunn
joined
us
,
with
*NL*
smoking
muskets
,
from
among
the
nutmeg-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forward
!
''
cried
the
doctor
.
``
Double
quick
,
my
lads
.
We
must
head
'em
*NL*
off
the
boats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
we
set
off
at
a
great
pace
,
sometimes
plunging
through
the
bushes
to
*NL*
the
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
tell
you
,
but
Silver
was
anxious
to
keep
up
with
us
.
The
work
that
man
*NL*
went
through
,
leaping
on
his
crutch
till
the
muscles
of
his
chest
were
*NL*
fit
to
burst
,
was
work
no
sound
man
ever
equalled
;
and
so
thinks
the
*NL*
doctor
.
As
it
was
,
he
was
already
thirty
yards
behind
us
and
on
the
*NL*
verge
of
strangling
when
we
reached
the
brow
of
the
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
''
he
hailed
,
``
see
there
!
No
hurry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
enough
there
was
no
hurry
.
In
a
more
open
part
of
the
plateau
,
we
*NL*
could
see
the
three
survivors
still
running
in
the
same
direction
as
*NL*
they
had
started
,
right
for
Mizzenmast
Hill
.
We
were
already
between
*NL*
them
and
the
boats
;
and
so
we
four
sat
down
to
breathe
,
while
Long
John
,
*NL*
mopping
his
face
,
came
slowly
up
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
ye
kindly
,
doctor
,
''
says
he
.
``
You
came
in
in
about
the
nick
,
I
*NL*
guess
,
for
me
and
Hawkins
.
And
so
it
's
you
,
Ben
Gunn
!
''
he
added
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
you
're
a
nice
one
,
to
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
Ben
Gunn
,
I
am
,
''
replied
the
maroon
,
wriggling
like
an
eel
in
his
*NL*
embarrassment
.
``
And
,
''
he
added
,
after
a
long
pause
,
``
how
do
,
Mr.
Silver
?
*NL*
Pretty
well
,
I
thank
ye
,
says
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ben
,
Ben
,
''
murmured
Silver
,
``
to
think
as
you
've
done
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
sent
back
Gray
for
one
of
the
pick-axes
deserted
,
in
their
*NL*
flight
,
by
the
mutineers
,
and
then
as
we
proceeded
leisurely
downhill
to
*NL*
where
the
boats
were
lying
,
related
in
a
few
words
what
had
taken
place
.
*NL*
It
was
a
story
that
profoundly
interested
Silver
;
and
Ben
Gunn
,
the
*NL*
half-idiot
maroon
,
was
the
hero
from
beginning
to
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
,
in
his
long
,
lonely
wanderings
about
the
island
,
had
found
the
*NL*
skeleton
--
it
was
he
that
had
rifled
it
;
he
had
found
the
treasure
;
he
*NL*
had
dug
it
up
-LRB-
it
was
the
haft
of
his
pick-axe
that
lay
broken
in
the
*NL*
excavation
-RRB-
;
he
had
carried
it
on
his
back
,
in
many
weary
journeys
,
from
*NL*
the
foot
of
the
tall
pine
to
a
cave
he
had
on
the
two-pointed
hill
at
*NL*
the
north-east
angle
of
the
island
,
and
there
it
had
lain
stored
in
*NL*
safety
since
two
months
before
the
arrival
of
the
HISPANIOLA
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
doctor
had
wormed
this
secret
from
him
on
the
afternoon
of
the
*NL*
attack
,
and
when
next
morning
he
saw
the
anchorage
deserted
,
he
had
gone
*NL*
to
Silver
,
given
him
the
chart
,
which
was
now
useless
--
given
him
the
*NL*
stores
,
for
Ben
Gunn
's
cave
was
well
supplied
with
goats
'
meat
salted
*NL*
by
himself
--
given
anything
and
everything
to
get
a
chance
of
moving
in
*NL*
safety
from
the
stockade
to
the
two-pointed
hill
,
there
to
be
clear
of
*NL*
malaria
and
keep
a
guard
upon
the
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
you
,
Jim
,
''
he
said
,
``
it
went
against
my
heart
,
but
I
did
what
I
*NL*
thought
best
for
those
who
had
stood
by
their
duty
;
and
if
you
were
not
*NL*
one
of
these
,
whose
fault
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
morning
,
finding
that
I
was
to
be
involved
in
the
horrid
*NL*
disappointment
he
had
prepared
for
the
mutineers
,
he
had
run
all
the
way
*NL*
to
the
cave
,
and
leaving
the
squire
to
guard
the
captain
,
had
taken
Gray
*NL*
and
the
maroon
and
started
,
making
the
diagonal
across
the
island
to
be
*NL*
at
hand
beside
the
pine
.
Soon
,
however
,
he
saw
that
our
party
had
the
*NL*
start
of
him
;
and
Ben
Gunn
,
being
fleet
of
foot
,
had
been
dispatched
in
*NL*
front
to
do
his
best
alone
.
Then
it
had
occurred
to
him
to
work
upon
the
*NL*
superstitions
of
his
former
shipmates
,
and
he
was
so
far
successful
that
*NL*
Gray
and
the
doctor
had
come
up
and
were
already
ambushed
before
the
*NL*
arrival
of
the
treasure-hunters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Silver
,
``
it
were
fortunate
for
me
that
I
had
Hawkins
here
.
*NL*
You
would
have
let
old
John
be
cut
to
bits
,
and
never
given
it
a
*NL*
thought
,
doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
thought
,
''
replied
Dr.
Livesey
cheerily
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
by
this
time
we
had
reached
the
gigs
.
The
doctor
,
with
the
pick-axe
,
*NL*
demolished
one
of
them
,
and
then
we
all
got
aboard
the
other
and
set
out
*NL*
to
go
round
by
sea
for
North
Inlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
run
of
eight
or
nine
miles
.
Silver
,
though
he
was
almost
*NL*
killed
already
with
fatigue
,
was
set
to
an
oar
,
like
the
rest
of
us
,
and
*NL*
we
were
soon
skimming
swiftly
over
a
smooth
sea
.
Soon
we
passed
out
*NL*
of
the
straits
and
doubled
the
south-east
corner
of
the
island
,
round
*NL*
which
,
four
days
ago
,
we
had
towed
the
HISPANIOLA
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
passed
the
two-pointed
hill
,
we
could
see
the
black
mouth
of
Ben
*NL*
Gunn
's
cave
and
a
figure
standing
by
it
,
leaning
on
a
musket
.
It
was
the
*NL*
squire
,
and
we
waved
a
handkerchief
and
gave
him
three
cheers
,
in
which
*NL*
the
voice
of
Silver
joined
as
heartily
as
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
miles
farther
,
just
inside
the
mouth
of
North
Inlet
,
what
should
*NL*
we
meet
but
the
HISPANIOLA
,
cruising
by
herself
?
The
last
flood
had
*NL*
lifted
her
,
and
had
there
been
much
wind
or
a
strong
tide
current
,
as
*NL*
in
the
southern
anchorage
,
we
should
never
have
found
her
more
,
or
found
*NL*
her
stranded
beyond
help
.
As
it
was
,
there
was
little
amiss
beyond
the
*NL*
wreck
of
the
main-sail
.
Another
anchor
was
got
ready
and
dropped
in
a
*NL*
fathom
and
a
half
of
water
.
We
all
pulled
round
again
to
Rum
Cove
,
*NL*
the
nearest
point
for
Ben
Gunn
's
treasure-house
;
and
then
Gray
,
*NL*
single-handed
,
returned
with
the
gig
to
the
HISPANIOLA
,
where
he
was
to
*NL*
pass
the
night
on
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gentle
slope
ran
up
from
the
beach
to
the
entrance
of
the
cave
.
At
the
*NL*
top
,
the
squire
met
us
.
To
me
he
was
cordial
and
kind
,
saying
nothing
*NL*
of
my
escapade
either
in
the
way
of
blame
or
praise
.
At
Silver
's
polite
*NL*
salute
he
somewhat
flushed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
John
Silver
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
're
a
prodigious
villain
and
imposter
--
a
*NL*
monstrous
imposter
,
sir
.
I
am
told
I
am
not
to
prosecute
you
.
Well
,
*NL*
then
,
I
will
not
.
But
the
dead
men
,
sir
,
hang
about
your
neck
like
*NL*
mill-stones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
kindly
,
sir
,
''
replied
Long
John
,
again
saluting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
you
to
thank
me
!
''
cried
the
squire
.
``
It
is
a
gross
dereliction
*NL*
of
my
duty
.
Stand
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
thereupon
we
all
entered
the
cave
.
It
was
a
large
,
airy
place
,
with
*NL*
a
little
spring
and
a
pool
of
clear
water
,
overhung
with
ferns
.
The
*NL*
floor
was
sand
.
Before
a
big
fire
lay
Captain
Smollett
;
and
in
a
far
*NL*
corner
,
only
duskily
flickered
over
by
the
blaze
,
I
beheld
great
heaps
*NL*
of
coin
and
quadrilaterals
built
of
bars
of
gold
.
That
was
Flint
's
*NL*
treasure
that
we
had
come
so
far
to
seek
and
that
had
cost
already
the
*NL*
lives
of
seventeen
men
from
the
HISPANIOLA
.
How
many
it
had
cost
in
the
*NL*
amassing
,
what
blood
and
sorrow
,
what
good
ships
scuttled
on
the
deep
,
*NL*
what
brave
men
walking
the
plank
blindfold
,
what
shot
of
cannon
,
what
*NL*
shame
and
lies
and
cruelty
,
perhaps
no
man
alive
could
tell
.
Yet
there
*NL*
were
still
three
upon
that
island
--
Silver
,
and
old
Morgan
,
and
Ben
*NL*
Gunn
--
who
had
each
taken
his
share
in
these
crimes
,
as
each
had
hoped
in
*NL*
vain
to
share
in
the
reward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
Jim
,
''
said
the
captain
.
``
You
're
a
good
boy
in
your
line
,
Jim
,
*NL*
but
I
do
n't
think
you
and
me
'll
go
to
sea
again
.
You
're
too
much
of
the
*NL*
born
favourite
for
me
.
Is
that
you
,
John
Silver
?
What
brings
you
here
,
*NL*
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
back
to
my
dooty
,
sir
,
''
returned
Silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
captain
,
and
that
was
all
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
supper
I
had
of
it
that
night
,
with
all
my
friends
around
me
;
and
*NL*
what
a
meal
it
was
,
with
Ben
Gunn
's
salted
goat
and
some
delicacies
and
*NL*
a
bottle
of
old
wine
from
the
HISPANIOLA
.
Never
,
I
am
sure
,
were
people
*NL*
gayer
or
happier
.
And
there
was
Silver
,
sitting
back
almost
out
of
the
*NL*
firelight
,
but
eating
heartily
,
prompt
to
spring
forward
when
anything
*NL*
was
wanted
,
even
joining
quietly
in
our
laughter
--
the
same
bland
,
*NL*
polite
,
obsequious
seaman
of
the
voyage
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
34
*NL*
*NL*
And
Last
*NL*
*NL*
THE
next
morning
we
fell
early
to
work
,
for
the
transportation
of
this
*NL*
great
mass
of
gold
near
a
mile
by
land
to
the
beach
,
and
thence
three
*NL*
miles
by
boat
to
the
HISPANIOLA
,
was
a
considerable
task
for
so
small
*NL*
a
number
of
workmen
.
The
three
fellows
still
abroad
upon
the
island
did
*NL*
not
greatly
trouble
us
;
a
single
sentry
on
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
was
*NL*
sufficient
to
ensure
us
against
any
sudden
onslaught
,
and
we
thought
,
*NL*
besides
,
they
had
had
more
than
enough
of
fighting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
the
work
was
pushed
on
briskly
.
Gray
and
Ben
Gunn
came
and
*NL*
went
with
the
boat
,
while
the
rest
during
their
absences
piled
treasure
*NL*
on
the
beach
.
Two
of
the
bars
,
slung
in
a
rope
's
end
,
made
a
good
load
*NL*
for
a
grown
man
--
one
that
he
was
glad
to
walk
slowly
with
.
For
my
part
,
*NL*
as
I
was
not
much
use
at
carrying
,
I
was
kept
busy
all
day
in
the
cave
*NL*
packing
the
minted
money
into
bread-bags
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
strange
collection
,
like
Billy
Bones
's
hoard
for
the
diversity
*NL*
of
coinage
,
but
so
much
larger
and
so
much
more
varied
that
I
think
I
*NL*
never
had
more
pleasure
than
in
sorting
them
.
English
,
French
,
Spanish
,
*NL*
Portuguese
,
Georges
,
and
Louises
,
doubloons
and
double
guineas
and
*NL*
moidores
and
sequins
,
the
pictures
of
all
the
kings
of
Europe
for
the
*NL*
last
hundred
years
,
strange
Oriental
pieces
stamped
with
what
looked
*NL*
like
wisps
of
string
or
bits
of
spider
's
web
,
round
pieces
and
square
*NL*
pieces
,
and
pieces
bored
through
the
middle
,
as
if
to
wear
them
round
*NL*
your
neck
--
nearly
every
variety
of
money
in
the
world
must
,
I
think
,
*NL*
have
found
a
place
in
that
collection
;
and
for
number
,
I
am
sure
they
*NL*
were
like
autumn
leaves
,
so
that
my
back
ached
with
stooping
and
my
*NL*
fingers
with
sorting
them
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Day
after
day
this
work
went
on
;
by
every
evening
a
fortune
had
been
*NL*
stowed
aboard
,
but
there
was
another
fortune
waiting
for
the
morrow
;
and
*NL*
all
this
time
we
heard
nothing
of
the
three
surviving
mutineers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
--
I
think
it
was
on
the
third
night
--
the
doctor
and
I
were
*NL*
strolling
on
the
shoulder
of
the
hill
where
it
overlooks
the
lowlands
of
*NL*
the
isle
,
when
,
from
out
the
thick
darkness
below
,
the
wind
brought
us
*NL*
a
noise
between
shrieking
and
singing
.
It
was
only
a
snatch
that
reached
*NL*
our
ears
,
followed
by
the
former
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
forgive
them
,
''
said
the
doctor
;
''
't
is
the
mutineers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
drunk
,
sir
,
''
struck
in
the
voice
of
Silver
from
behind
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silver
,
I
should
say
,
was
allowed
his
entire
liberty
,
and
in
spite
of
*NL*
daily
rebuffs
,
seemed
to
regard
himself
once
more
as
quite
a
privileged
*NL*
and
friendly
dependent
.
Indeed
,
it
was
remarkable
how
well
he
bore
*NL*
these
slights
and
with
what
unwearying
politeness
he
kept
on
trying
to
*NL*
ingratiate
himself
with
all
.
Yet
,
I
think
,
none
treated
him
better
than
*NL*
a
dog
,
unless
it
was
Ben
Gunn
,
who
was
still
terribly
afraid
of
his
old
*NL*
quartermaster
,
or
myself
,
who
had
really
something
to
thank
him
for
;
*NL*
although
for
that
matter
,
I
suppose
,
I
had
reason
to
think
even
worse
of
*NL*
him
than
anybody
else
,
for
I
had
seen
him
meditating
a
fresh
treachery
*NL*
upon
the
plateau
.
Accordingly
,
it
was
pretty
gruffly
that
the
doctor
*NL*
answered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Drunk
or
raving
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
you
were
,
sir
,
''
replied
Silver
;
``
and
precious
little
odds
which
,
*NL*
to
you
and
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
would
hardly
ask
me
to
call
you
a
humane
man
,
''
returned
*NL*
the
doctor
with
a
sneer
,
``
and
so
my
feelings
may
surprise
you
,
Master
*NL*
Silver
.
But
if
I
were
sure
they
were
raving
--
as
I
am
morally
certain
*NL*
one
,
at
least
,
of
them
is
down
with
fever
--
I
should
leave
this
camp
,
*NL*
and
at
whatever
risk
to
my
own
carcass
,
take
them
the
assistance
of
my
*NL*
skill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
your
pardon
,
sir
,
you
would
be
very
wrong
,
''
quoth
Silver
.
``
You
*NL*
would
lose
your
precious
life
,
and
you
may
lay
to
that
.
I
'm
on
your
side
*NL*
now
,
hand
and
glove
;
and
I
should
n't
wish
for
to
see
the
party
weakened
,
*NL*
let
alone
yourself
,
seeing
as
I
know
what
I
owes
you
.
But
these
men
down
*NL*
there
,
they
could
n't
keep
their
word
--
no
,
not
supposing
they
wished
to
;
*NL*
and
what
's
more
,
they
could
n't
believe
as
you
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
``
You
're
the
man
to
keep
your
word
,
we
know
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
that
was
about
the
last
news
we
had
of
the
three
pirates
.
Only
*NL*
once
we
heard
a
gunshot
a
great
way
off
and
supposed
them
to
be
hunting
.
*NL*
A
council
was
held
,
and
it
was
decided
that
we
must
desert
them
on
the
*NL*
island
--
to
the
huge
glee
,
I
must
say
,
of
Ben
Gunn
,
and
with
the
strong
*NL*
approval
of
Gray
.
We
left
a
good
stock
of
powder
and
shot
,
the
bulk
*NL*
of
the
salt
goat
,
a
few
medicines
,
and
some
other
necessaries
,
tools
,
*NL*
clothing
,
a
spare
sail
,
a
fathom
or
two
of
rope
,
and
by
the
particular
*NL*
desire
of
the
doctor
,
a
handsome
present
of
tobacco
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
about
our
last
doing
on
the
island
.
Before
that
,
we
had
got
the
*NL*
treasure
stowed
and
had
shipped
enough
water
and
the
remainder
of
the
*NL*
goat
meat
in
case
of
any
distress
;
and
at
last
,
one
fine
morning
,
we
*NL*
weighed
anchor
,
which
was
about
all
that
we
could
manage
,
and
stood
out
*NL*
of
North
Inlet
,
the
same
colours
flying
that
the
captain
had
flown
and
*NL*
fought
under
at
the
palisade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
fellows
must
have
been
watching
us
closer
than
we
thought
for
,
*NL*
as
we
soon
had
proved
.
For
coming
through
the
narrows
,
we
had
to
*NL*
lie
very
near
the
southern
point
,
and
there
we
saw
all
three
of
*NL*
them
kneeling
together
on
a
spit
of
sand
,
with
their
arms
raised
in
*NL*
supplication
.
It
went
to
all
our
hearts
,
I
think
,
to
leave
them
in
that
*NL*
wretched
state
;
but
we
could
not
risk
another
mutiny
;
and
to
take
them
*NL*
home
for
the
gibbet
would
have
been
a
cruel
sort
of
kindness
.
The
doctor
*NL*
hailed
them
and
told
them
of
the
stores
we
had
left
,
and
where
they
were
*NL*
to
find
them
.
But
they
continued
to
call
us
by
name
and
appeal
to
us
,
*NL*
for
God
's
sake
,
to
be
merciful
and
not
leave
them
to
die
in
such
a
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
seeing
the
ship
still
bore
on
her
course
and
was
now
swiftly
*NL*
drawing
out
of
earshot
,
one
of
them
--
I
know
not
which
it
was
--
leapt
to
*NL*
his
feet
with
a
hoarse
cry
,
whipped
his
musket
to
his
shoulder
,
and
sent
*NL*
a
shot
whistling
over
Silver
's
head
and
through
the
main-sail
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
we
kept
under
cover
of
the
bulwarks
,
and
when
next
I
looked
*NL*
out
they
had
disappeared
from
the
spit
,
and
the
spit
itself
had
almost
*NL*
melted
out
of
sight
in
the
growing
distance
.
That
was
,
at
least
,
the
end
*NL*
of
that
;
and
before
noon
,
to
my
inexpressible
joy
,
the
highest
rock
of
*NL*
Treasure
Island
had
sunk
into
the
blue
round
of
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
so
short
of
men
that
everyone
on
board
had
to
bear
a
hand
--
only
*NL*
the
captain
lying
on
a
mattress
in
the
stern
and
giving
his
orders
,
for
*NL*
though
greatly
recovered
he
was
still
in
want
of
quiet
.
We
laid
her
*NL*
head
for
the
nearest
port
in
Spanish
America
,
for
we
could
not
risk
the
*NL*
voyage
home
without
fresh
hands
;
and
as
it
was
,
what
with
baffling
winds
*NL*
and
a
couple
of
fresh
gales
,
we
were
all
worn
out
before
we
reached
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
at
sundown
when
we
cast
anchor
in
a
most
beautiful
*NL*
land-locked
gulf
,
and
were
immediately
surrounded
by
shore
boats
full
*NL*
of
Negroes
and
Mexican
Indians
and
half-bloods
selling
fruits
and
*NL*
vegetables
and
offering
to
dive
for
bits
of
money
.
The
sight
of
so
many
*NL*
good-humoured
faces
-LRB-
especially
the
blacks
-RRB-
,
the
taste
of
the
tropical
*NL*
fruits
,
and
above
all
the
lights
that
began
to
shine
in
the
town
made
a
*NL*
most
charming
contrast
to
our
dark
and
bloody
sojourn
on
the
island
;
*NL*
and
the
doctor
and
the
squire
,
taking
me
along
with
them
,
went
ashore
*NL*
to
pass
the
early
part
of
the
night
.
Here
they
met
the
captain
of
an
*NL*
English
man-of-war
,
fell
in
talk
with
him
,
went
on
board
his
ship
,
and
,
*NL*
in
short
,
had
so
agreeable
a
time
that
day
was
breaking
when
we
came
*NL*
alongside
the
HISPANIOLA
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ben
Gunn
was
on
deck
alone
,
and
as
soon
as
we
came
on
board
he
began
,
*NL*
with
wonderful
contortions
,
to
make
us
a
confession
.
Silver
was
gone
.
*NL*
The
maroon
had
connived
at
his
escape
in
a
shore
boat
some
hours
ago
,
*NL*
and
he
now
assured
us
he
had
only
done
so
to
preserve
our
lives
,
which
*NL*
would
certainly
have
been
forfeit
if
``
that
man
with
the
one
leg
*NL*
had
stayed
aboard
.
''
But
this
was
not
all
.
The
sea-cook
had
not
gone
*NL*
empty-handed
.
He
had
cut
through
a
bulkhead
unobserved
and
had
removed
*NL*
one
of
the
sacks
of
coin
,
worth
perhaps
three
or
four
hundred
guineas
,
*NL*
to
help
him
on
his
further
wanderings
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
we
were
all
pleased
to
be
so
cheaply
quit
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
to
make
a
long
story
short
,
we
got
a
few
hands
on
board
,
made
a
*NL*
good
cruise
home
,
and
the
HISPANIOLA
reached
Bristol
just
as
Mr.
Blandly
*NL*
was
beginning
to
think
of
fitting
out
her
consort
.
Five
men
only
of
*NL*
those
who
had
sailed
returned
with
her
.
``
Drink
and
the
devil
had
done
*NL*
for
the
rest
,
''
with
a
vengeance
,
although
,
to
be
sure
,
we
were
not
quite
*NL*
in
so
bad
a
case
as
that
other
ship
they
sang
about
:
*NL*
*NL*
With
one
man
of
her
crew
alive
,
*NL*
What
put
to
sea
with
seventy-five
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
us
had
an
ample
share
of
the
treasure
and
used
it
wisely
or
*NL*
foolishly
,
according
to
our
natures
.
Captain
Smollett
is
now
retired
*NL*
from
the
sea
.
Gray
not
only
saved
his
money
,
but
being
suddenly
smit
*NL*
with
the
desire
to
rise
,
also
studied
his
profession
,
and
he
is
now
*NL*
mate
and
part
owner
of
a
fine
full-rigged
ship
,
married
besides
,
and
the
*NL*
father
of
a
family
.
As
for
Ben
Gunn
,
he
got
a
thousand
pounds
,
which
he
*NL*
spent
or
lost
in
three
weeks
,
or
to
be
more
exact
,
in
nineteen
days
,
for
*NL*
he
was
back
begging
on
the
twentieth
.
Then
he
was
given
a
lodge
to
keep
,
*NL*
exactly
as
he
had
feared
upon
the
island
;
and
he
still
lives
,
a
great
*NL*
favourite
,
though
something
of
a
butt
,
with
the
country
boys
,
and
a
*NL*
notable
singer
in
church
on
Sundays
and
saints
'
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
Silver
we
have
heard
no
more
.
That
formidable
seafaring
man
with
one
*NL*
leg
has
at
last
gone
clean
out
of
my
life
;
but
I
dare
say
he
met
his
old
*NL*
Negress
,
and
perhaps
still
lives
in
comfort
with
her
and
Captain
Flint
.
*NL*
It
is
to
be
hoped
so
,
I
suppose
,
for
his
chances
of
comfort
in
another
*NL*
world
are
very
small
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bar
silver
and
the
arms
still
lie
,
for
all
that
I
know
,
where
*NL*
Flint
buried
them
;
and
certainly
they
shall
lie
there
for
me
.
Oxen
and
*NL*
wain-ropes
would
not
bring
me
back
again
to
that
accursed
island
;
and
*NL*
the
worst
dreams
that
ever
I
have
are
when
I
hear
the
surf
booming
about
*NL*
its
coasts
or
start
upright
in
bed
with
the
sharp
voice
of
Captain
Flint
*NL*
still
ringing
in
my
ears
:
``
Pieces
of
eight
!
