Chapter
One
*NL*
Arrest
-
Conversation
with
Mrs.
Grubach
-
Then
Miss
Buerstner
*NL*
*NL*
Someone
must
have
been
telling
lies
about
Josef
K.
,
he
knew
he
had
*NL*
done
nothing
wrong
but
,
one
morning
,
he
was
arrested
.
Every
day
at
*NL*
eight
in
the
morning
he
was
brought
his
breakfast
by
Mrs.
Grubach
's
*NL*
cook
-
Mrs.
Grubach
was
his
landlady
-
but
today
she
did
n't
come
.
That
*NL*
had
never
happened
before
.
K.
waited
a
little
while
,
looked
from
his
*NL*
pillow
at
the
old
woman
who
lived
opposite
and
who
was
watching
him
with
*NL*
an
inquisitiveness
quite
unusual
for
her
,
and
finally
,
both
hungry
and
*NL*
disconcerted
,
rang
the
bell
.
There
was
immediately
a
knock
at
the
door
*NL*
and
a
man
entered
.
He
had
never
seen
the
man
in
this
house
before
.
He
*NL*
was
slim
but
firmly
built
,
his
clothes
were
black
and
close-fitting
,
*NL*
with
many
folds
and
pockets
,
buckles
and
buttons
and
a
belt
,
all
of
*NL*
which
gave
the
impression
of
being
very
practical
but
without
making
it
*NL*
very
clear
what
they
were
actually
for
.
``
Who
are
you
?
''
asked
K.
,
*NL*
sitting
half
upright
in
his
bed
.
The
man
,
however
,
ignored
the
question
*NL*
as
if
his
arrival
simply
had
to
be
accepted
,
and
merely
replied
,
``
You
*NL*
rang
?
''
``
Anna
should
have
brought
me
my
breakfast
,
''
said
K
.
He
tried
to
*NL*
work
out
who
the
man
actually
was
,
first
in
silence
,
just
through
*NL*
observation
and
by
thinking
about
it
,
but
the
man
did
n't
stay
still
to
*NL*
be
looked
at
for
very
long
.
Instead
he
went
over
to
the
door
,
opened
it
*NL*
slightly
,
and
said
to
someone
who
was
clearly
standing
immediately
*NL*
behind
it
,
``
He
wants
Anna
to
bring
him
his
breakfast
.
''
There
was
a
*NL*
little
laughter
in
the
neighbouring
room
,
it
was
not
clear
from
the
*NL*
sound
of
it
whether
there
were
several
people
laughing
.
The
strange
man
*NL*
could
not
have
learned
anything
from
it
that
he
had
n't
known
already
,
*NL*
but
now
he
said
to
K.
,
as
if
making
his
report
``
It
is
not
possible
.
''
*NL*
``
It
would
be
the
first
time
that
's
happened
,
''
said
K.
,
as
he
jumped
out
*NL*
of
bed
and
quickly
pulled
on
his
trousers
.
``
I
want
to
see
who
that
is
*NL*
in
the
next
room
,
and
why
it
is
that
Mrs.
Grubach
has
let
me
be
*NL*
disturbed
in
this
way
.
''
It
immediately
occurred
to
him
that
he
need
n't
*NL*
have
said
this
out
loud
,
and
that
he
must
to
some
extent
have
*NL*
acknowledged
their
authority
by
doing
so
,
but
that
did
n't
seem
important
*NL*
to
him
at
the
time
.
That
,
at
least
,
is
how
the
stranger
took
it
,
as
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Do
n't
you
think
you
'd
better
stay
where
you
are
?
''
``
I
want
*NL*
neither
to
stay
here
nor
to
be
spoken
to
by
you
until
you
've
introduced
*NL*
yourself
.
''
``
I
meant
it
for
your
own
good
,
''
said
the
stranger
and
opened
*NL*
the
door
,
this
time
without
being
asked
.
The
next
room
,
which
K.
*NL*
entered
more
slowly
than
he
had
intended
,
looked
at
first
glance
exactly
*NL*
the
same
as
it
had
the
previous
evening
.
It
was
Mrs.
Grubach
's
living
*NL*
room
,
over-filled
with
furniture
,
tablecloths
,
porcelain
and
*NL*
photographs
.
Perhaps
there
was
a
little
more
space
in
there
than
usual
*NL*
today
,
but
if
so
it
was
not
immediately
obvious
,
especially
as
the
main
*NL*
difference
was
the
presence
of
a
man
sitting
by
the
open
window
with
a
*NL*
book
from
which
he
now
looked
up
.
``
You
should
have
stayed
in
your
room
!
*NL*
Did
n't
Franz
tell
you
?
''
``
And
what
is
it
you
want
,
then
?
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
looking
back
and
forth
between
this
new
acquaintance
and
the
one
named
*NL*
Franz
,
who
had
remained
in
the
doorway
.
Through
the
open
window
he
*NL*
noticed
the
old
woman
again
,
who
had
come
close
to
the
window
opposite
*NL*
so
that
she
could
continue
to
see
everything
.
She
was
showing
an
*NL*
inquisitiveness
that
really
made
it
seem
like
she
was
going
senile
.
``
I
*NL*
want
to
see
Mrs.
Grubach
...
,
''
said
K.
,
making
a
movement
as
if
tearing
*NL*
himself
away
from
the
two
men
-
even
though
they
were
standing
well
away
*NL*
from
him
-
and
wanted
to
go
.
``
No
,
''
said
the
man
at
the
window
,
who
*NL*
threw
his
book
down
on
a
coffee
table
and
stood
up
.
``
You
ca
n't
go
away
*NL*
when
you
're
under
arrest
.
''
``
That
's
how
it
seems
,
''
said
K.
``
And
why
am
*NL*
I
under
arrest
?
''
he
then
asked
.
``
That
's
something
we
're
not
allowed
to
*NL*
tell
you
.
Go
into
your
room
and
wait
there
.
Proceedings
are
underway
*NL*
and
you
'll
learn
about
everything
all
in
good
time
.
It
's
not
really
*NL*
part
of
my
job
to
be
friendly
towards
you
like
this
,
but
I
hope
no-one
,
*NL*
apart
from
Franz
,
will
hear
about
it
,
and
he
's
been
more
friendly
*NL*
towards
you
than
he
should
have
been
,
under
the
rules
,
himself
.
If
you
*NL*
carry
on
having
as
much
good
luck
as
you
have
been
with
your
arresting
*NL*
officers
then
you
can
reckon
on
things
going
well
with
you
.
''
K.
wanted
*NL*
to
sit
down
,
but
then
he
saw
that
,
apart
from
the
chair
by
the
window
,
*NL*
there
was
nowhere
anywhere
in
the
room
where
he
could
sit
.
``
You
'll
get
*NL*
the
chance
to
see
for
yourself
how
true
all
this
is
,
''
said
Franz
and
*NL*
both
men
then
walked
up
to
K
.
They
were
significantly
bigger
than
him
,
*NL*
especially
the
second
man
,
who
frequently
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
The
two
of
them
felt
K.
's
nightshirt
,
and
said
he
would
now
have
to
wear
*NL*
one
that
was
of
much
lower
quality
,
but
that
they
would
keep
the
*NL*
nightshirt
along
with
his
other
underclothes
and
return
them
to
him
if
*NL*
his
case
turned
out
well
.
``
It
's
better
for
you
if
you
give
us
the
*NL*
things
than
if
you
leave
them
in
the
storeroom
,
''
they
said
.
``
Things
*NL*
have
a
tendency
to
go
missing
in
the
storeroom
,
and
after
a
certain
*NL*
amount
of
time
they
sell
things
off
,
whether
the
case
involved
has
come
*NL*
to
an
end
or
not
.
And
cases
like
this
can
last
a
long
time
,
especially
*NL*
the
ones
that
have
been
coming
up
lately
.
They
'd
give
you
the
money
*NL*
they
got
for
them
,
but
it
would
n't
be
very
much
as
it
's
not
what
they
're
*NL*
offered
for
them
when
they
sell
them
that
counts
,
it
's
how
much
they
get
*NL*
slipped
on
the
side
,
and
things
like
that
lose
their
value
anyway
when
*NL*
they
get
passed
on
from
hand
to
hand
,
year
after
year
.
''
K.
paid
hardly
*NL*
any
attention
to
what
they
were
saying
,
he
did
not
place
much
value
on
*NL*
what
he
may
have
still
possessed
or
on
who
decided
what
happened
to
*NL*
them
.
It
was
much
more
important
to
him
to
get
a
clear
understanding
of
*NL*
his
position
,
but
he
could
not
think
clearly
while
these
people
were
*NL*
here
,
the
second
policeman
's
belly
-
and
they
could
only
be
policemen
-
*NL*
looked
friendly
enough
,
sticking
out
towards
him
,
but
when
K.
looked
up
*NL*
and
saw
his
dry
,
boney
face
it
did
not
seem
to
fit
with
the
body
.
His
*NL*
strong
nose
twisted
to
one
side
as
if
ignoring
K.
and
sharing
an
*NL*
understanding
with
the
other
policeman
.
What
sort
of
people
were
these
?
*NL*
What
were
they
talking
about
?
What
office
did
they
belong
to
?
K.
was
*NL*
living
in
a
free
country
,
after
all
,
everywhere
was
at
peace
,
all
laws
*NL*
were
decent
and
were
upheld
,
who
was
it
who
dared
accost
him
in
his
own
*NL*
home
?
He
was
always
inclined
to
take
life
as
lightly
as
he
could
,
to
*NL*
cross
bridges
when
he
came
to
them
,
pay
no
heed
for
the
future
,
even
*NL*
when
everything
seemed
under
threat
.
But
here
that
did
not
seem
the
*NL*
right
thing
to
do
.
He
could
have
taken
it
all
as
a
joke
,
a
big
joke
set
*NL*
up
by
his
colleagues
at
the
bank
for
some
unknown
reason
,
or
also
*NL*
perhaps
because
today
was
his
thirtieth
birthday
,
it
was
all
possible
of
*NL*
course
,
maybe
all
he
had
to
do
was
laugh
in
the
policemen
's
face
in
some
*NL*
way
and
they
would
laugh
with
him
,
maybe
they
were
tradesmen
from
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
street
,
they
looked
like
they
might
be
-
but
he
was
*NL*
nonetheless
determined
,
ever
since
he
first
caught
sight
of
the
one
*NL*
called
Franz
,
not
to
lose
any
slight
advantage
he
might
have
had
over
*NL*
these
people
.
There
was
a
very
slight
risk
that
people
would
later
say
*NL*
he
could
n't
understand
a
joke
,
but
-
although
he
was
n't
normally
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
learning
from
experience
-
he
might
also
have
had
a
few
*NL*
unimportant
occasions
in
mind
when
,
unlike
his
more
cautious
friends
,
he
*NL*
had
acted
with
no
thought
at
all
for
what
might
follow
and
had
been
made
*NL*
to
suffer
for
it
.
He
did
n't
want
that
to
happen
again
,
not
this
time
at
*NL*
least
;
if
they
were
play-acting
he
would
act
along
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
had
time
.
``
Allow
me
,
''
he
said
,
and
hurried
between
the
*NL*
two
policemen
through
into
his
room
.
``
He
seems
sensible
enough
,
''
he
*NL*
heard
them
say
behind
him
.
Once
in
his
room
,
he
quickly
pulled
open
the
*NL*
drawer
of
his
writing
desk
,
everything
in
it
was
very
tidy
but
in
his
*NL*
agitation
he
was
unable
to
find
the
identification
documents
he
was
*NL*
looking
for
straight
away
.
He
finally
found
his
bicycle
permit
and
was
*NL*
about
to
go
back
to
the
policemen
with
it
when
it
seemed
to
him
too
*NL*
petty
,
so
he
carried
on
searching
until
he
found
his
birth
certificate
.
*NL*
Just
as
he
got
back
in
the
adjoining
room
the
door
on
the
other
side
*NL*
opened
and
Mrs.
Grubach
was
about
to
enter
.
He
only
saw
her
for
an
*NL*
instant
,
for
as
soon
as
she
recognised
K.
she
was
clearly
embarrassed
,
*NL*
asked
for
forgiveness
and
disappeared
,
closing
the
door
behind
her
very
*NL*
carefully
.
``
Do
come
in
,
''
K.
could
have
said
just
then
.
But
now
he
stood
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
the
room
with
his
papers
in
his
hand
and
still
looking
*NL*
at
the
door
which
did
not
open
again
.
He
stayed
like
that
until
he
was
*NL*
startled
out
of
it
by
the
shout
of
the
policeman
who
sat
at
the
little
*NL*
table
at
the
open
window
and
,
as
K.
now
saw
,
was
eating
his
breakfast
.
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
she
come
in
?
''
he
asked
.
``
She
's
not
allowed
to
,
''
said
the
*NL*
big
policeman
.
``
You
're
under
arrest
,
are
n't
you
.
''
``
But
how
can
I
be
*NL*
under
arrest
?
And
how
come
it
's
like
this
?
''
``
Now
you
're
starting
*NL*
again
,
''
said
the
policeman
,
dipping
a
piece
of
buttered
bread
in
the
*NL*
honeypot
.
``
We
do
n't
answer
questions
like
that
.
''
``
You
will
have
to
*NL*
answer
them
,
''
said
K.
``
Here
are
my
identification
papers
,
now
show
me
*NL*
yours
and
I
certainly
want
to
see
the
arrest
warrant
.
''
``
Oh
,
my
God
!
''
*NL*
said
the
policeman
.
``
In
a
position
like
yours
,
and
you
think
you
can
*NL*
start
giving
orders
,
do
you
?
It
wo
n't
do
you
any
good
to
get
us
on
the
*NL*
wrong
side
,
even
if
you
think
it
will
-
we
're
probably
more
on
your
side
*NL*
that
anyone
else
you
know
!
''
``
That
's
true
,
you
know
,
you
'd
better
*NL*
believe
it
,
''
said
Franz
,
holding
a
cup
of
coffee
in
his
hand
which
he
*NL*
did
not
lift
to
his
mouth
but
looked
at
K.
in
a
way
that
was
probably
*NL*
meant
to
be
full
of
meaning
but
could
not
actually
be
understood
.
K.
*NL*
found
himself
,
without
intending
it
,
in
a
mute
dialogue
with
Franz
,
but
*NL*
then
slapped
his
hand
down
on
his
papers
and
said
,
``
Here
are
my
identity
*NL*
documents
.
''
``
And
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
about
it
?
''
replied
the
big
*NL*
policeman
,
loudly
.
``
The
way
you
're
carrying
on
,
it
's
worse
than
a
*NL*
child
.
What
is
it
you
want
?
Do
you
want
to
get
this
great
,
bloody
trial
*NL*
of
yours
over
with
quickly
by
talking
about
ID
and
arrest
warrants
with
*NL*
us
?
We
're
just
coppers
,
that
's
all
we
are
.
Junior
officers
like
us
*NL*
hardly
know
one
end
of
an
ID
card
from
another
,
all
we
've
got
to
do
with
*NL*
you
is
keep
an
eye
on
you
for
ten
hours
a
day
and
get
paid
for
it
.
*NL*
That
's
all
we
are
.
Mind
you
,
what
we
can
do
is
make
sure
that
the
high
*NL*
officials
we
work
for
find
out
just
what
sort
of
person
it
is
they
're
*NL*
going
to
arrest
,
and
why
he
should
be
arrested
,
before
they
issue
the
*NL*
warrant
.
There
's
no
mistake
there
.
Our
authorities
as
far
as
I
know
,
*NL*
and
I
only
know
the
lowest
grades
,
do
n't
go
out
looking
for
guilt
among
*NL*
the
public
;
it
's
the
guilt
that
draws
them
out
,
like
it
says
in
the
law
,
*NL*
and
they
have
to
send
us
police
officers
out
.
That
's
the
law
.
Where
*NL*
d'you
think
there
'd
be
any
mistake
there
?
''
``
I
do
n't
know
this
law
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
``
So
much
the
worse
for
you
,
then
,
''
said
the
policeman
.
``
It
's
*NL*
probably
exists
only
in
your
heads
,
''
said
K.
,
he
wanted
,
in
some
way
,
to
*NL*
insinuate
his
way
into
the
thoughts
of
the
policemen
,
to
re-shape
those
*NL*
thoughts
to
his
benefit
or
to
make
himself
at
home
there
.
But
the
*NL*
policeman
just
said
dismissively
,
``
You
'll
find
out
when
it
affects
you
.
''
*NL*
Franz
joined
in
,
and
said
,
``
Look
at
this
,
Willem
,
he
admits
he
does
n't
*NL*
know
the
law
and
at
the
same
time
insists
he
's
innocent
.
''
``
You
're
quite
*NL*
right
,
but
we
ca
n't
get
him
to
understand
a
thing
,
''
said
the
other
.
K.
*NL*
stopped
talking
with
them
;
do
I
,
he
thought
to
himself
,
do
I
really
have
*NL*
to
carry
on
getting
tangled
up
with
the
chattering
of
base
functionaries
*NL*
like
this
?
-
and
they
admit
themselves
that
they
are
of
the
lowest
*NL*
position
.
They
're
talking
about
things
of
which
they
do
n't
have
the
*NL*
slightest
understanding
,
anyway
.
It
's
only
because
of
their
stupidity
*NL*
that
they
're
able
to
be
so
sure
of
themselves
.
I
just
need
few
words
*NL*
with
someone
of
the
same
social
standing
as
myself
and
everything
will
*NL*
be
incomparably
clearer
,
much
clearer
than
a
long
conversation
with
*NL*
these
two
can
make
it
.
He
walked
up
and
down
the
free
space
in
the
room
*NL*
a
couple
of
times
,
across
the
street
he
could
see
the
old
woman
who
,
*NL*
now
,
had
pulled
an
old
man
,
much
older
than
herself
,
up
to
the
window
*NL*
and
had
her
arms
around
him
.
K.
had
to
put
an
end
to
this
display
,
*NL*
``
Take
me
to
your
superior
,
''
he
said
.
``
As
soon
as
he
wants
to
see
you
.
*NL*
Not
before
,
''
said
the
policeman
,
the
one
called
Willem
.
``
And
now
my
*NL*
advice
to
you
,
''
he
added
,
``
is
to
go
into
your
room
,
stay
calm
,
and
wait
*NL*
and
see
what
's
to
be
done
with
you
.
If
you
take
our
advice
,
you
wo
n't
*NL*
tire
yourself
out
thinking
about
things
to
no
purpose
,
you
need
to
pull
*NL*
yourself
together
as
there
's
a
lot
that
's
going
to
required
of
you
.
*NL*
You
've
not
behaved
towards
us
the
way
we
deserve
after
being
so
good
to
*NL*
you
,
you
forget
that
we
,
whatever
we
are
,
we
're
still
free
men
and
*NL*
you
're
not
,
and
that
's
quite
an
advantage
.
But
in
spite
of
all
that
*NL*
we
're
still
willing
,
if
you
've
got
the
money
,
to
go
and
get
you
some
*NL*
breakfast
from
the
cafe
over
the
road
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
giving
any
answer
to
this
offer
,
K.
stood
still
for
some
*NL*
time
.
Perhaps
,
if
he
opened
the
door
of
the
next
room
or
even
the
front
*NL*
door
,
the
two
of
them
would
not
dare
to
stand
in
his
way
,
perhaps
that
*NL*
would
be
the
simplest
way
to
settle
the
whole
thing
,
by
bringing
it
to
a
*NL*
head
.
But
maybe
they
would
grab
him
,
and
if
he
were
thrown
down
on
the
*NL*
ground
he
would
lose
all
the
advantage
he
,
in
a
certain
respect
,
had
*NL*
over
them
.
So
he
decided
on
the
more
certain
solution
,
the
way
things
*NL*
would
go
in
the
natural
course
of
events
,
and
went
back
in
his
room
*NL*
without
another
word
either
from
him
or
from
the
policemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
himself
down
on
his
bed
,
and
from
the
dressing
table
he
*NL*
took
the
nice
apple
that
he
had
put
there
the
previous
evening
for
his
*NL*
breakfast
.
Now
it
was
all
the
breakfast
he
had
and
anyway
,
as
he
*NL*
confirmed
as
soon
as
he
took
his
first
,
big
bite
of
it
,
it
was
far
*NL*
better
than
a
breakfast
he
could
have
had
through
the
good
will
of
the
*NL*
policemen
from
the
dirty
cafe
.
He
felt
well
and
confident
,
he
had
*NL*
failed
to
go
into
work
at
the
bank
this
morning
but
that
could
easily
be
*NL*
excused
because
of
the
relatively
high
position
he
held
there
.
Should
*NL*
he
really
send
in
his
explanation
?
He
wondered
about
it
.
If
nobody
*NL*
believed
him
,
and
in
this
case
that
would
be
understandable
,
he
could
*NL*
bring
Mrs.
Grubach
in
as
a
witness
,
or
even
the
old
pair
from
across
the
*NL*
street
,
who
probably
even
now
were
on
their
way
over
to
the
window
*NL*
opposite
.
It
puzzled
K.
,
at
least
it
puzzled
him
looking
at
it
from
the
*NL*
policemen
's
point
of
view
,
that
they
had
made
him
go
into
the
room
and
*NL*
left
him
alone
there
,
where
he
had
ten
different
ways
of
killing
*NL*
himself
.
At
the
same
time
,
though
,
he
asked
himself
,
this
time
looking
*NL*
at
it
from
his
own
point
of
view
,
what
reason
he
could
have
to
do
so
.
*NL*
Because
those
two
were
sitting
there
in
the
next
room
and
had
taken
his
*NL*
breakfast
,
perhaps
?
It
would
have
been
so
pointless
to
kill
himself
*NL*
that
,
even
if
he
had
wanted
to
,
the
pointlessness
would
have
made
him
*NL*
unable
.
Maybe
,
if
the
policemen
had
not
been
so
obviously
limited
in
*NL*
their
mental
abilities
,
it
could
have
been
supposed
that
they
had
come
*NL*
to
the
same
conclusion
and
saw
no
danger
in
leaving
him
alone
because
of
*NL*
it
.
They
could
watch
now
,
if
they
wanted
,
and
see
how
he
went
over
to
*NL*
the
cupboard
in
the
wall
where
he
kept
a
bottle
of
good
schnapps
,
how
he
*NL*
first
emptied
a
glass
of
it
in
place
of
his
breakfast
and
how
he
then
*NL*
took
a
second
glassful
in
order
to
give
himself
courage
,
the
last
one
*NL*
just
as
a
precaution
for
the
unlikely
chance
it
would
be
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
was
so
startled
by
a
shout
to
him
from
the
other
room
that
*NL*
he
struck
his
teeth
against
the
glass
.
``
The
supervisor
wants
to
see
*NL*
you
!
''
a
voice
said
.
It
was
only
the
shout
that
startled
him
,
this
curt
,
*NL*
abrupt
,
military
shout
,
that
he
would
not
have
expected
from
the
*NL*
policeman
called
Franz
.
In
itself
,
he
found
the
order
very
welcome
.
*NL*
``
At
last
!
''
he
called
back
,
locked
the
cupboard
and
,
without
delay
,
*NL*
hurried
into
the
next
room
.
The
two
policemen
were
standing
there
and
*NL*
chased
him
back
into
his
bedroom
as
if
that
were
a
matter
of
course
.
*NL*
``
What
d'you
think
you
're
doing
?
''
they
cried
.
``
Think
you
're
going
to
see
*NL*
the
supervisor
dressed
in
just
your
shirt
,
do
you
?
He
'd
see
to
it
you
*NL*
got
a
right
thumping
,
and
us
and
all
!
''
``
Let
go
of
me
for
God
's
sake
!
''
*NL*
called
K.
,
who
had
already
been
pushed
back
as
far
as
his
wardrobe
,
``
if
*NL*
you
accost
me
when
I
'm
still
in
bed
you
ca
n't
expect
to
find
me
in
my
*NL*
evening
dress
.
''
``
That
wo
n't
help
you
,
''
said
the
policemen
,
who
always
*NL*
became
very
quiet
,
almost
sad
,
when
K.
began
to
shout
,
and
in
that
way
*NL*
confused
him
or
,
to
some
extent
,
brought
him
to
his
senses
.
``
Ridiculous
*NL*
formalities
!
''
he
grumbled
,
as
he
lifted
his
coat
from
the
chair
and
kept
*NL*
it
in
both
his
hands
for
a
little
while
,
as
if
holding
it
out
for
the
*NL*
policemen
's
inspection
.
They
shook
their
heads
.
``
It
's
got
to
be
a
*NL*
black
coat
,
''
they
said
.
At
that
,
K.
threw
the
coat
to
the
floor
and
*NL*
said
-
without
knowing
even
himself
what
he
meant
by
it
-
``
Well
it
's
not
*NL*
going
to
be
the
main
trial
,
after
all
.
''
The
policemen
laughed
,
but
*NL*
continued
to
insist
,
``
It
's
got
to
be
a
black
coat
.
''
``
Well
that
's
*NL*
alright
by
me
if
it
makes
things
go
any
faster
,
''
said
K
.
He
opened
the
*NL*
wardrobe
himself
,
spent
a
long
time
searching
through
all
the
clothes
,
*NL*
and
chose
his
best
black
suit
which
had
a
short
jacket
that
had
greatly
*NL*
surprised
those
who
knew
him
,
then
he
also
pulled
out
a
fresh
shirt
and
*NL*
began
,
carefully
,
to
get
dressed
.
He
secretly
told
himself
that
he
had
*NL*
succeeded
in
speeding
things
up
by
letting
the
policemen
forget
to
make
*NL*
him
have
a
bath
.
He
watched
them
to
see
if
they
might
remember
after
*NL*
all
,
but
of
course
it
never
occurred
to
them
,
although
Willem
did
not
*NL*
forget
to
send
Franz
up
to
the
supervisor
with
the
message
saying
that
*NL*
K.
was
getting
dressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
was
properly
dressed
,
K.
had
to
pass
by
Willem
as
he
went
*NL*
through
the
next
room
into
the
one
beyond
,
the
door
of
which
was
already
*NL*
wide
open
.
K.
knew
very
well
that
this
room
had
recently
been
let
to
a
*NL*
typist
called
`
Miss
Buerstner
'
.
She
was
in
the
habit
of
going
out
to
*NL*
work
very
early
and
coming
back
home
very
late
,
and
K.
had
never
*NL*
exchanged
more
than
a
few
words
of
greeting
with
her
.
Now
,
her
bedside
*NL*
table
had
been
pulled
into
the
middle
of
the
room
to
be
used
as
a
desk
*NL*
for
these
proceedings
,
and
the
supervisor
sat
behind
it
.
He
had
his
*NL*
legs
crossed
,
and
had
thrown
one
arm
over
the
backrest
of
the
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
corner
of
the
room
there
were
three
young
people
looking
at
*NL*
the
photographs
belonging
to
Miss
Buerstner
that
had
been
put
into
a
*NL*
piece
of
fabric
on
the
wall
.
Hung
up
on
the
handle
of
the
open
window
*NL*
was
a
white
blouse
.
At
the
window
across
the
street
,
there
was
the
old
*NL*
pair
again
,
although
now
their
number
had
increased
,
as
behind
them
,
and
*NL*
far
taller
than
they
were
,
stood
a
man
with
an
open
shirt
that
showed
*NL*
his
chest
and
a
reddish
goatee
beard
which
he
squeezed
and
twisted
with
*NL*
his
fingers
.
``
Josef
K.
?
''
asked
the
supervisor
,
perhaps
merely
to
*NL*
attract
K.
's
attention
as
he
looked
round
the
room
.
K.
nodded
.
``
I
*NL*
daresay
you
were
quite
surprised
by
all
that
's
been
taking
place
this
*NL*
morning
,
''
said
the
supervisor
as
,
with
both
hands
,
he
pushed
away
the
*NL*
few
items
on
the
bedside
table
-
the
candle
and
box
of
matches
,
a
book
*NL*
and
a
pin
cushion
which
lay
there
as
if
they
were
things
he
would
need
*NL*
for
his
own
business
.
``
Certainly
,
''
said
K.
,
and
he
began
to
feel
*NL*
relaxed
now
that
,
at
last
,
he
stood
in
front
of
someone
with
some
sense
,
*NL*
someone
with
whom
he
would
be
able
to
talk
about
his
situation
.
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
'm
surprised
,
but
I
'm
not
in
any
way
very
surprised
.
''
*NL*
``
You
're
not
very
surprised
?
''
asked
the
supervisor
,
as
he
positioned
the
*NL*
candle
in
the
middle
of
the
table
and
the
other
things
in
a
group
around
*NL*
it
.
``
Perhaps
you
do
n't
quite
understand
me
,
''
K.
hurriedly
pointed
out
.
*NL*
``
What
I
mean
is
...
''
here
K.
broke
off
what
he
was
saying
and
looked
*NL*
round
for
somewhere
to
sit
.
``
I
may
sit
down
,
may
n't
I
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
``
That
's
not
usual
,
''
the
supervisor
answered
.
``
What
I
mean
is
...
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
without
delaying
a
second
time
,
``
that
,
yes
,
I
am
very
surprised
but
*NL*
when
you
've
been
in
the
world
for
thirty
years
already
and
had
to
make
*NL*
your
own
way
through
everything
yourself
,
which
has
been
my
lot
,
then
*NL*
you
become
hardened
to
surprises
and
do
n't
take
them
too
hard
.
*NL*
Especially
not
what
's
happened
today
.
''
``
Why
especially
not
what
's
*NL*
happened
today
?
''
``
I
would
n't
want
to
say
that
I
see
all
of
this
as
a
*NL*
joke
,
you
seem
to
have
gone
to
too
much
trouble
making
all
these
*NL*
arrangements
for
that
.
Everyone
in
the
house
must
be
taking
part
in
it
*NL*
as
well
as
all
of
you
,
that
would
be
going
beyond
what
could
be
a
joke
.
*NL*
So
I
do
n't
want
to
say
that
this
is
a
joke
.
''
``
Quite
right
,
''
said
the
*NL*
supervisor
,
looking
to
see
how
many
matches
were
left
in
the
box
.
``
But
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
,
''
K.
went
on
,
looking
round
at
everyone
there
and
even
*NL*
wishing
he
could
get
the
attention
of
the
three
who
were
looking
at
the
*NL*
photographs
,
``
on
the
other
hand
this
really
ca
n't
be
all
that
*NL*
important
.
That
follows
from
the
fact
that
I
've
been
indicted
,
but
*NL*
ca
n't
think
of
the
slightest
offence
for
which
I
could
be
indicted
.
*NL*
But
even
that
is
all
beside
the
point
,
the
main
question
is
:
Who
is
*NL*
issuing
the
indictment
?
What
office
is
conducting
this
affair
?
Are
you
*NL*
officials
?
None
of
you
is
wearing
a
uniform
,
unless
what
you
are
*NL*
wearing
''
-
here
he
turned
towards
Franz
-
``
is
meant
to
be
a
uniform
,
*NL*
it
's
actually
more
of
a
travelling
suit
.
I
require
a
clear
answer
to
*NL*
all
these
questions
,
and
I
'm
quite
sure
that
once
things
have
been
made
*NL*
clear
we
can
take
our
leave
of
each
other
on
the
best
of
terms
.
''
The
*NL*
supervisor
slammed
the
box
of
matches
down
on
the
table
.
``
You
're
making
*NL*
a
big
mistake
,
''
he
said
.
``
These
gentlemen
and
I
have
got
nothing
to
do
*NL*
with
your
business
,
in
fact
we
know
almost
nothing
about
you
.
We
could
*NL*
be
wearing
uniforms
as
proper
and
exact
as
you
like
and
your
situation
*NL*
would
n't
be
any
the
worse
for
it
.
As
to
whether
you
're
on
a
charge
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
give
you
any
sort
of
clear
answer
to
that
,
I
do
n't
even
know
*NL*
whether
you
are
or
not
.
You
're
under
arrest
,
you
're
quite
right
about
*NL*
that
,
but
I
do
n't
know
any
more
than
that
.
Maybe
these
officers
have
*NL*
been
chit-chatting
with
you
,
well
if
they
have
that
's
all
it
is
,
chit
-
*NL*
chat
.
I
ca
n't
give
you
an
answer
to
your
questions
,
but
I
can
give
you
*NL*
a
bit
of
advice
:
You
'd
better
think
less
about
us
and
what
's
going
to
*NL*
happen
to
you
,
and
think
a
bit
more
about
yourself
.
And
stop
making
all
*NL*
this
fuss
about
your
sense
of
innocence
;
you
do
n't
make
such
a
bad
*NL*
impression
,
but
with
all
this
fuss
you
're
damaging
it
.
And
you
ought
to
*NL*
do
a
bit
less
talking
,
too
.
Almost
everything
you
've
said
so
far
has
*NL*
been
things
we
could
have
taken
from
your
behaviour
,
even
if
you
'd
said
*NL*
no
more
than
a
few
words
.
And
what
you
have
said
has
not
exactly
been
*NL*
in
your
favour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
K.
stared
at
the
supervisor
.
Was
this
man
,
probably
younger
than
*NL*
he
was
,
lecturing
him
like
a
schoolmaster
?
Was
he
being
punished
for
*NL*
his
honesty
with
a
telling
off
?
And
was
he
to
learn
nothing
about
the
*NL*
reasons
for
his
arrest
or
those
who
were
arresting
him
?
He
became
*NL*
somewhat
cross
and
began
to
walk
up
and
down
.
No-one
stopped
him
doing
*NL*
this
and
he
pushed
his
sleeves
back
,
felt
his
chest
,
straightened
his
*NL*
hair
,
went
over
to
the
three
men
,
said
,
``
It
makes
no
sense
,
''
at
which
*NL*
these
three
turned
round
to
face
him
and
came
towards
him
with
serious
*NL*
expressions
.
He
finally
came
again
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
*NL*
supervisor
's
desk
.
``
State
Attorney
Hasterer
is
a
good
friend
of
mine
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
can
I
telephone
him
?
''
``
Certainly
,
''
said
the
supervisor
,
``
but
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
the
point
of
that
will
be
,
I
suppose
you
must
have
*NL*
some
private
matter
you
want
to
discuss
with
him
.
''
``
What
the
point
is
?
''
*NL*
shouted
K.
,
more
disconcerted
that
cross
.
``
Who
do
you
think
you
are
?
*NL*
You
want
to
see
some
point
in
it
while
you
're
carrying
out
something
as
*NL*
pointless
as
it
could
be
?
It
's
enough
to
make
you
cry
!
These
gentlemen
*NL*
first
accost
me
,
and
now
they
sit
or
stand
about
in
here
and
let
me
be
*NL*
hauled
up
in
front
of
you
.
What
point
there
would
be
,
in
telephoning
a
*NL*
state
attorney
when
I
'm
ostensibly
under
arrest
?
Very
well
,
I
wo
n't
*NL*
make
the
telephone
call
.
''
``
You
can
call
him
if
you
want
to
,
''
said
the
*NL*
supervisor
,
stretching
his
hand
out
towards
the
outer
room
where
the
*NL*
telephone
was
,
``
please
,
go
on
,
do
make
your
phone
call
.
''
``
No
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
any
more
,
''
said
K.
,
and
went
over
to
the
window
.
Across
the
*NL*
street
,
the
people
were
still
there
at
the
window
,
and
it
was
only
now
*NL*
that
K.
had
gone
up
to
his
window
that
they
seemed
to
become
uneasy
*NL*
about
quietly
watching
what
was
going
on
.
The
old
couple
wanted
to
get
*NL*
up
but
the
man
behind
them
calmed
them
down
.
``
We
've
got
some
kind
of
*NL*
audience
over
there
,
''
called
K.
to
the
supervisor
,
quite
loudly
,
as
he
*NL*
pointed
out
with
his
forefinger
.
``
Go
away
,
''
he
then
called
across
to
*NL*
them
.
And
the
three
of
them
did
immediately
retreat
a
few
steps
,
the
*NL*
old
pair
even
found
themselves
behind
the
man
who
then
concealed
them
*NL*
with
the
breadth
of
his
body
and
seemed
,
going
by
the
movements
of
his
*NL*
mouth
,
to
be
saying
something
incomprehensible
into
the
distance
.
They
*NL*
did
not
disappear
entirely
,
though
,
but
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
the
*NL*
moment
when
they
could
come
back
to
the
window
without
being
noticed
.
*NL*
``
Intrusive
,
thoughtless
people
!
''
said
K.
as
he
turned
back
into
the
*NL*
room
.
The
supervisor
may
have
agreed
with
him
,
at
least
K.
thought
that
*NL*
was
what
he
saw
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
.
But
it
was
just
as
possible
*NL*
that
he
had
not
even
been
listening
as
he
had
his
hand
pressed
firmly
*NL*
down
on
the
table
and
seemed
to
be
comparing
the
length
of
his
fingers
.
*NL*
The
two
policemen
were
sitting
on
a
chest
covered
with
a
coloured
*NL*
blanket
,
rubbing
their
knees
.
The
three
young
people
had
put
their
*NL*
hands
on
their
hips
and
were
looking
round
aimlessly
.
Everything
was
*NL*
still
,
like
in
some
office
that
has
been
forgotten
about
.
``
Now
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
''
called
out
K.
,
and
for
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
*NL*
carrying
all
of
them
on
his
shoulders
,
``
it
looks
like
your
business
with
*NL*
me
is
over
with
.
In
my
opinion
,
it
's
best
now
to
stop
wondering
about
*NL*
whether
you
're
proceeding
correctly
or
incorrectly
,
and
to
bring
the
*NL*
matter
to
a
peaceful
close
with
a
mutual
handshake
.
If
you
are
of
the
*NL*
same
opinion
,
then
please
...
''
and
he
walked
up
to
the
supervisor
's
desk
*NL*
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
.
The
supervisor
raised
his
eyes
,
bit
his
*NL*
lip
and
looked
at
K.
's
outstretched
hand
;
K
still
believed
the
*NL*
supervisor
would
do
as
he
suggested
.
But
instead
,
he
stood
up
,
picked
*NL*
up
a
hard
round
hat
that
was
laying
on
Miss
Buerstner
's
bed
and
put
it
*NL*
carefully
onto
his
head
,
using
both
hands
as
if
trying
on
a
new
hat
.
*NL*
``
Everything
seems
so
simple
to
you
,
does
n't
it
,
''
he
said
to
K.
as
he
did
*NL*
so
,
``
so
you
think
we
should
bring
the
matter
to
a
peaceful
close
,
do
*NL*
you
.
No
,
no
,
that
wo
n't
do
.
Mind
you
,
on
the
other
hand
I
certainly
*NL*
would
n't
want
you
to
think
there
's
no
hope
for
you
.
No
,
why
should
you
*NL*
think
that
?
You
're
simply
under
arrest
,
nothing
more
than
that
.
That
's
*NL*
what
I
had
to
tell
you
,
that
's
what
I
've
done
and
now
I
've
seen
how
*NL*
you
've
taken
it
.
That
's
enough
for
one
day
and
we
can
take
our
leave
of
*NL*
each
other
,
for
the
time
being
at
least
.
I
expect
you
'll
want
to
go
in
*NL*
to
the
bank
now
,
wo
n't
you
.
''
``
In
to
the
bank
?
''
asked
K.
,
``
I
thought
I
*NL*
was
under
arrest
.
''
K.
said
this
with
a
certain
amount
of
defiance
as
,
*NL*
although
his
handshake
had
not
been
accepted
,
he
was
feeling
more
*NL*
independent
of
all
these
people
,
especially
since
the
supervisor
had
*NL*
stood
up
.
He
was
playing
with
them
.
If
they
left
,
he
had
decided
he
*NL*
would
run
after
them
and
offer
to
let
them
arrest
him
.
That
's
why
he
*NL*
even
repeated
,
``
How
can
I
go
in
to
the
bank
when
I
'm
under
arrest
?
''
``
I
*NL*
see
you
've
misunderstood
me
,
''
said
the
supervisor
who
was
already
at
the
*NL*
door
.
``
It
's
true
that
you
're
under
arrest
,
but
that
should
n't
stop
you
*NL*
from
carrying
out
your
job
.
And
there
should
n't
be
anything
to
stop
you
*NL*
carrying
on
with
your
usual
life
.
''
``
In
that
case
it
's
not
too
bad
,
*NL*
being
under
arrest
,
''
said
K.
,
and
went
up
close
to
the
supervisor
.
``
I
*NL*
never
meant
it
should
be
anything
else
,
''
he
replied
.
``
It
hardly
seems
*NL*
to
have
been
necessary
to
notify
me
of
the
arrest
in
that
case
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
and
went
even
closer
.
The
others
had
also
come
closer
.
All
of
them
had
*NL*
gathered
together
into
a
narrow
space
by
the
door
.
``
That
was
my
duty
,
''
*NL*
said
the
supervisor
.
``
A
silly
duty
,
''
said
K.
,
unyielding
.
``
Maybe
so
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
supervisor
,
``
only
do
n't
let
's
waste
our
time
talking
on
like
*NL*
this
.
I
had
assumed
you
'd
be
wanting
to
go
to
the
bank
.
As
you
're
*NL*
paying
close
attention
to
every
word
I
'll
add
this
:
I
'm
not
forcing
you
*NL*
to
go
to
the
bank
,
I
'd
just
assumed
you
wanted
to
.
And
to
make
things
*NL*
easier
for
you
,
and
to
let
you
get
to
the
bank
with
as
little
fuss
as
*NL*
possible
I
've
put
these
three
gentlemen
,
colleagues
of
yours
,
at
your
*NL*
disposal
.
''
``
What
's
that
?
''
exclaimed
K.
,
and
looked
at
the
three
in
*NL*
astonishment
.
He
could
only
remember
seeing
them
in
their
group
by
the
*NL*
photographs
,
but
these
characterless
,
anaemic
young
people
were
indeed
*NL*
officials
from
his
bank
,
not
colleagues
of
his
,
that
was
putting
it
too
*NL*
high
and
it
showed
a
gap
in
the
omniscience
of
the
supervisor
,
but
they
*NL*
were
nonetheless
junior
members
of
staff
at
the
bank
.
How
could
K.
have
*NL*
failed
to
see
that
?
How
occupied
he
must
have
been
with
the
supervisor
*NL*
and
the
policemen
not
to
have
recognised
these
three
!
Rabensteiner
,
*NL*
with
his
stiff
demeanour
and
swinging
hands
,
Kullich
,
with
his
blonde
*NL*
hair
and
deep-set
eyes
,
and
Kaminer
,
with
his
involuntary
grin
caused
by
*NL*
chronic
muscle
spasms
.
``
Good
morning
,
''
said
K.
after
a
while
,
extending
*NL*
his
hand
to
the
gentlemen
as
they
bowed
correctly
to
him
.
``
I
did
n't
*NL*
recognise
you
at
all
.
So
,
we
'll
go
into
work
now
,
shall
we
?
''
The
*NL*
gentlemen
laughed
and
nodded
enthusiastically
,
as
if
that
was
what
they
*NL*
had
been
waiting
for
all
the
time
,
except
that
K.
had
left
his
hat
in
*NL*
his
room
so
they
all
dashed
,
one
after
another
,
into
the
room
to
fetch
*NL*
it
,
which
caused
a
certain
amount
of
embarrassment
.
K.
stood
where
he
*NL*
was
and
watched
them
through
the
open
double
doorway
,
the
last
to
go
,
of
*NL*
course
,
was
the
apathetic
Rabensteiner
who
had
broken
into
no
more
than
*NL*
an
elegant
trot
.
Kaminer
got
to
the
hat
and
K.
,
as
he
often
had
to
do
*NL*
at
the
bank
,
forcibly
reminded
himself
that
the
grin
was
not
deliberate
,
*NL*
that
he
in
fact
was
n't
able
to
grin
deliberately
.
At
that
moment
Mrs.
*NL*
Grubach
opened
the
door
from
the
hallway
into
the
living
room
where
all
*NL*
the
people
were
.
She
did
not
seem
to
feel
guilty
about
anything
at
all
,
*NL*
and
K.
,
as
often
before
,
looked
down
at
the
belt
of
her
apron
which
,
for
*NL*
no
reason
,
cut
so
deeply
into
her
hefty
body
.
Once
downstairs
,
K.
,
with
*NL*
his
watch
in
his
hand
,
decided
to
take
a
taxi
-
he
had
already
been
*NL*
delayed
by
half
an
hour
and
there
was
no
need
to
make
the
delay
any
*NL*
longer
.
Kaminer
ran
to
the
corner
to
summon
it
,
and
the
two
others
were
*NL*
making
obvious
efforts
to
keep
K.
diverted
when
Kullich
pointed
to
the
*NL*
doorway
of
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
where
the
large
man
*NL*
with
the
blonde
goatee
beard
appeared
and
,
a
little
embarrassed
at
first
*NL*
at
letting
himself
be
seen
in
his
full
height
,
stepped
back
to
the
wall
*NL*
and
leant
against
it
.
The
old
couple
were
probably
still
on
the
stairs
.
*NL*
K.
was
cross
with
Kullich
for
pointing
out
this
man
whom
he
had
already
*NL*
seen
himself
,
in
fact
whom
he
had
been
expecting
.
``
Do
n't
look
at
him
!
''
*NL*
he
snapped
,
without
noticing
how
odd
it
was
to
speak
to
free
men
in
this
*NL*
way
.
But
there
was
no
explanation
needed
anyway
as
just
then
the
taxi
*NL*
arrived
,
they
sat
inside
and
set
off
.
Inside
the
taxi
,
K.
remembered
*NL*
that
he
had
not
noticed
the
supervisor
and
the
policemen
leaving
-
the
*NL*
supervisor
had
stopped
him
noticing
the
three
bank
staff
and
now
the
*NL*
three
bank
staff
had
stopped
him
noticing
the
supervisor
.
This
showed
*NL*
that
K.
was
not
very
attentive
,
and
he
resolved
to
watch
himself
more
*NL*
carefully
in
this
respect
.
Nonetheless
,
he
gave
it
no
thought
as
he
*NL*
twisted
himself
round
and
leant
over
onto
the
rear
shelf
of
the
car
to
*NL*
catch
sight
of
the
supervisor
and
the
policemen
if
he
could
.
But
he
*NL*
turned
back
round
straight
away
and
leant
comfortably
into
the
corner
of
*NL*
the
taxi
without
even
having
made
the
effort
to
see
anyone
.
Although
it
*NL*
did
not
seem
like
it
,
now
was
just
the
time
when
he
needed
some
*NL*
encouragement
,
but
the
gentlemen
seemed
tired
just
then
,
Rabensteiner
*NL*
looked
out
of
the
car
to
the
right
,
Kullich
to
the
left
and
only
Kaminer
*NL*
was
there
with
his
grin
at
K.
's
service
.
It
would
have
been
inhumane
to
*NL*
make
fun
of
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
spring
,
whenever
possible
,
K.
usually
spent
his
evenings
*NL*
after
work
-
he
usually
stayed
in
the
office
until
nine
o'clock
-
with
a
*NL*
short
walk
,
either
by
himself
or
in
the
company
of
some
of
the
bank
*NL*
officials
,
and
then
he
would
go
into
a
pub
where
he
would
sit
at
the
*NL*
regulars
'
table
with
mostly
older
men
until
eleven
.
There
were
,
*NL*
however
,
also
exceptions
to
this
habit
,
times
,
for
instance
,
when
K.
was
*NL*
invited
by
the
bank
's
manager
-LRB-
whom
he
greatly
respected
for
his
*NL*
industry
and
trustworthiness
-RRB-
to
go
with
him
for
a
ride
in
his
car
or
to
*NL*
eat
dinner
with
him
at
his
large
house
.
K.
would
also
go
,
once
a
week
,
*NL*
to
see
a
girl
called
Elsa
who
worked
as
a
waitress
in
a
wine
bar
through
*NL*
the
night
until
late
in
the
morning
.
During
the
daytime
she
only
*NL*
received
visitors
while
still
in
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
though
,
-
the
day
had
passed
quickly
with
a
lot
of
*NL*
hard
work
and
many
respectful
and
friendly
birthday
greetings
-
K.
*NL*
wanted
to
go
straight
home
.
Each
time
he
had
any
small
break
from
the
*NL*
day
's
work
he
considered
,
without
knowing
exactly
what
he
had
in
mind
,
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Grubach
's
flat
seemed
to
have
been
put
into
great
disarray
by
*NL*
the
events
of
that
morning
,
and
that
it
was
up
to
him
to
put
it
back
*NL*
into
order
.
Once
order
had
been
restored
,
every
trace
of
those
events
*NL*
would
have
been
erased
and
everything
would
take
its
previous
course
*NL*
once
more
.
In
particular
,
there
was
nothing
to
fear
from
the
three
bank
*NL*
officials
,
they
had
immersed
themselves
back
into
their
paperwork
and
*NL*
there
was
no
alteration
to
be
seen
in
them
.
K.
had
called
each
of
them
,
*NL*
separately
or
all
together
,
into
his
office
that
day
for
no
other
reason
*NL*
than
to
observe
them
;
he
was
always
satisfied
and
had
always
been
able
*NL*
to
let
them
go
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half
past
nine
that
evening
,
when
he
arrived
back
in
front
of
*NL*
the
building
where
he
lived
,
he
met
a
young
lad
in
the
doorway
who
was
*NL*
standing
there
,
his
legs
apart
and
smoking
a
pipe
.
``
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
immediately
asked
K.
,
bringing
his
face
close
to
the
lad
's
,
as
it
was
*NL*
hard
to
see
in
the
half
light
of
the
landing
.
``
I
'm
the
landlord
's
son
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
answered
the
lad
,
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
stepping
to
*NL*
one
side
.
``
The
landlord
's
son
?
''
asked
K.
,
and
impatiently
knocked
on
*NL*
the
ground
with
his
stick
.
``
Did
you
want
anything
,
sir
?
Would
you
like
*NL*
me
to
fetch
my
father
?
''
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
K.
,
there
was
something
*NL*
forgiving
in
his
voice
,
as
if
the
boy
had
harmed
him
in
some
way
and
he
*NL*
was
excusing
him
.
``
It
's
alright
,
''
he
said
then
,
and
went
on
,
but
before
*NL*
going
up
the
stairs
he
turned
round
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
have
gone
directly
to
his
room
,
but
as
he
wanted
to
speak
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Grubach
he
went
straight
to
her
door
and
knocked
.
She
was
sat
*NL*
at
the
table
with
a
knitted
stocking
and
a
pile
of
old
stockings
in
*NL*
front
of
her
.
K.
apologised
,
a
little
embarrassed
at
coming
so
late
,
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Grubach
was
very
friendly
and
did
not
want
to
hear
any
apology
,
*NL*
she
was
always
ready
to
speak
to
him
,
he
knew
very
well
that
he
was
her
*NL*
best
and
her
favourite
tenant
.
K.
looked
round
the
room
,
it
looked
*NL*
exactly
as
it
usually
did
,
the
breakfast
dishes
,
which
had
been
on
the
*NL*
table
by
the
window
that
morning
,
had
already
been
cleared
away
.
``
A
*NL*
woman
's
hands
will
do
many
things
when
no-one
's
looking
,
''
he
thought
,
he
*NL*
might
himself
have
smashed
all
the
dishes
on
the
spot
but
certainly
*NL*
would
not
have
been
able
to
carry
it
all
out
.
He
looked
at
Mrs.
Grubach
*NL*
with
some
gratitude
.
``
Why
are
you
working
so
late
?
''
he
asked
.
They
*NL*
were
now
both
sitting
at
the
table
,
and
K.
now
and
then
sank
his
hands
*NL*
into
the
pile
of
stockings
.
``
There
's
a
lot
of
work
to
do
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
during
the
day
I
belong
to
the
tenants
;
if
I
'm
to
sort
out
my
own
*NL*
things
there
are
only
the
evenings
left
to
me
.
''
``
I
fear
I
may
have
*NL*
caused
you
some
exceptional
work
today
.
''
``
How
do
you
mean
,
Mr.
K.
?
''
she
*NL*
asked
,
becoming
more
interested
and
leaving
her
work
in
her
lap
.
``
I
*NL*
mean
the
men
who
were
here
this
morning
.
''
``
Oh
,
I
see
,
''
she
said
,
and
*NL*
went
peacefully
back
to
what
she
was
doing
,
``
that
was
no
trouble
,
not
*NL*
especially
.
''
K.
looked
on
in
silence
as
she
took
up
the
knitted
*NL*
stocking
once
more
.
She
seems
surprised
at
my
mentioning
it
,
he
*NL*
thought
,
she
seems
to
think
it
's
improper
for
me
to
mention
it
.
All
the
*NL*
more
important
for
me
to
do
so
.
An
old
woman
is
the
only
person
I
can
*NL*
speak
about
it
with
.
``
But
it
must
have
caused
some
work
for
you
,
''
he
*NL*
said
then
,
``
but
it
wo
n't
happen
again
.
''
``
No
,
it
ca
n't
happen
again
,
''
she
*NL*
agreed
,
and
smiled
at
K.
in
a
way
that
was
almost
pained
.
``
Do
you
mean
*NL*
that
seriously
?
''
asked
K.
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
,
more
gently
,
``
but
the
*NL*
important
thing
is
you
must
n't
take
it
too
hard
.
There
are
so
many
*NL*
awful
things
happening
in
the
world
!
As
you
're
being
so
honest
with
me
,
*NL*
Mr.
K.
,
I
can
admit
to
you
that
I
listened
to
a
little
of
what
was
going
*NL*
on
from
behind
the
door
,
and
that
those
two
policemen
told
me
one
or
two
*NL*
things
as
well
.
It
's
all
to
do
with
your
happiness
,
and
that
's
*NL*
something
that
's
quite
close
to
my
heart
,
perhaps
more
than
it
should
be
*NL*
as
I
am
,
after
all
,
only
your
landlady
.
Anyway
,
so
I
heard
one
or
two
*NL*
things
but
I
ca
n't
really
say
that
it
's
about
anything
very
serious
.
*NL*
No
.
You
have
been
arrested
,
but
it
's
not
in
the
same
way
as
when
they
*NL*
arrest
a
thief
.
If
you
're
arrested
in
the
same
way
as
a
thief
,
then
*NL*
it
's
bad
,
but
an
arrest
like
this
...
.
It
seems
to
me
that
it
's
*NL*
something
very
complicated
-
forgive
me
if
I
'm
saying
something
stupid
-
*NL*
something
very
complicated
that
I
do
n't
understand
,
but
something
that
*NL*
you
do
n't
really
need
to
understand
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
stupid
about
what
you
've
said
,
Mrs.
Grubach
,
or
*NL*
at
least
I
partly
agree
with
you
,
only
,
the
way
I
judge
the
whole
thing
*NL*
is
harsher
than
yours
,
and
think
it
's
not
only
not
something
complicated
*NL*
but
simply
a
fuss
about
nothing
.
I
was
just
caught
unawares
,
that
's
*NL*
what
happened
.
If
I
had
got
up
as
soon
as
I
was
awake
without
letting
*NL*
myself
get
confused
because
Anna
was
n't
there
,
if
I
'd
got
up
and
paid
no
*NL*
regard
to
anyone
who
might
have
been
in
my
way
and
come
straight
to
you
,
*NL*
if
I
'd
done
something
like
having
my
breakfast
in
the
kitchen
as
an
*NL*
exception
,
asked
you
to
bring
my
clothes
from
my
room
,
in
short
,
if
I
*NL*
had
behaved
sensibly
then
nothing
more
would
have
happened
,
everything
*NL*
that
was
waiting
to
happen
would
have
been
stifled
.
People
are
so
often
*NL*
unprepared
.
In
the
bank
,
for
example
,
I
am
well
prepared
,
nothing
of
*NL*
this
sort
could
possibly
happen
to
me
there
,
I
have
my
own
assistant
*NL*
there
,
there
are
telephones
for
internal
and
external
calls
in
front
of
*NL*
me
on
the
desk
,
I
continually
receive
visits
from
people
,
*NL*
representatives
,
officials
,
but
besides
that
,
and
most
importantly
,
I
'm
*NL*
always
occupied
with
my
work
,
that
's
to
say
I
'm
always
alert
,
it
would
*NL*
even
be
a
pleasure
for
me
to
find
myself
faced
with
something
of
that
*NL*
sort
.
But
now
it
's
over
with
,
and
I
did
n't
really
even
want
to
talk
*NL*
about
it
any
more
,
only
I
wanted
to
hear
what
you
,
as
a
sensible
woman
,
*NL*
thought
about
it
all
,
and
I
'm
very
glad
to
hear
that
we
're
in
agreement
.
*NL*
But
now
you
must
give
me
your
hand
,
an
agreement
of
this
sort
needs
to
*NL*
be
confirmed
with
a
handshake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
she
shake
hands
with
me
?
The
supervisor
did
n't
shake
hands
,
*NL*
he
thought
,
and
looked
at
the
woman
differently
from
before
,
examining
*NL*
her
.
She
stood
up
,
as
he
had
also
stood
up
,
and
was
a
little
self
-
*NL*
conscious
,
she
had
n't
been
able
to
understand
everything
that
K.
*NL*
said
.
As
a
result
of
this
self
consciousness
she
said
something
that
*NL*
she
certainly
did
not
intend
and
certainly
was
not
appropriate
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
take
it
so
hard
,
Mr.
K.
,
''
she
said
,
with
tears
in
her
voice
and
also
,
of
*NL*
course
,
forgetting
the
handshake
.
``
I
did
n't
know
I
was
taking
it
hard
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
,
feeling
suddenly
tired
and
seeing
that
if
this
woman
did
agree
*NL*
with
him
it
was
of
very
little
value
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
going
out
the
door
he
asked
,
``
Is
Miss
Buerstner
home
?
''
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grubach
,
smiling
as
she
gave
this
simple
piece
of
*NL*
information
,
saying
something
sensible
at
last
.
``
She
's
at
the
theatre
.
*NL*
Did
you
want
to
see
her
?
Should
I
give
her
a
message
?
''
``
I
,
er
,
I
just
*NL*
wanted
to
have
a
few
words
with
her
.
''
``
I
'm
afraid
I
do
n't
know
when
*NL*
she
's
coming
in
;
she
usually
gets
back
late
when
she
's
been
to
the
*NL*
theatre
.
''
``
It
really
does
n't
matter
,
''
said
K.
his
head
hanging
as
he
*NL*
turned
to
the
door
to
leave
,
``
I
just
wanted
to
give
her
my
apology
for
*NL*
taking
over
her
room
today
.
''
``
There
's
no
need
for
that
,
Mr.
K.
,
you
're
*NL*
too
conscientious
,
the
young
lady
does
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
she
*NL*
has
n't
been
home
since
early
this
morning
and
everything
's
been
tidied
*NL*
up
again
,
you
can
see
for
yourself
.
''
And
she
opened
the
door
to
Miss
*NL*
Buerstner
's
room
.
``
Thank
you
,
I
'll
take
your
word
for
it
,
''
said
K
,
but
*NL*
went
nonetheless
over
to
the
open
door
.
The
moon
shone
quietly
into
the
*NL*
unlit
room
.
As
far
as
could
be
seen
,
everything
was
indeed
in
its
*NL*
place
,
not
even
the
blouse
was
hanging
on
the
window
handle
.
The
*NL*
pillows
on
the
bed
looked
remarkably
plump
as
they
lay
half
in
the
*NL*
moonlight
.
``
Miss
Buerstner
often
comes
home
late
,
''
said
K.
,
looking
at
*NL*
Mrs.
Grubach
as
if
that
were
her
responsibility
.
``
That
's
how
young
*NL*
people
are
!
''
said
Mrs.
Grubach
to
excuse
herself
.
``
Of
course
,
of
*NL*
course
,
''
said
K.
,
``
but
it
can
be
taken
too
far
.
''
``
Yes
,
it
can
be
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Grubach
,
``
you
're
so
right
,
Mr.
K.
Perhaps
it
is
in
this
case
.
I
*NL*
certainly
would
n't
want
to
say
anything
nasty
about
Miss
Buerstner
,
she
*NL*
is
a
good
,
sweet
girl
,
friendly
,
tidy
,
punctual
,
works
hard
,
I
*NL*
appreciate
all
that
very
much
,
but
one
thing
is
true
,
she
ought
to
have
*NL*
more
pride
,
be
a
bit
less
forthcoming
.
Twice
this
month
already
,
in
the
*NL*
street
over
the
way
,
I
've
seen
her
with
a
different
gentleman
.
I
really
*NL*
do
n't
like
saying
this
,
you
're
the
only
one
I
've
said
this
to
,
Mr.
K.
,
I
*NL*
swear
to
God
,
but
I
'm
going
to
have
no
choice
but
to
have
a
few
words
*NL*
with
Miss
Buerstner
about
it
myself
.
And
it
's
not
the
only
thing
about
*NL*
her
that
I
'm
worried
about
.
''
``
Mrs.
Grubach
,
you
are
on
quite
the
wrong
*NL*
track
,
''
said
K.
,
so
angry
that
he
was
hardly
able
to
hide
it
,
``
and
you
*NL*
have
moreover
misunderstood
what
I
was
saying
about
Miss
Buerstner
,
that
*NL*
is
not
what
I
meant
.
In
fact
I
warn
you
quite
directly
not
to
say
*NL*
anything
to
her
,
you
are
quite
mistaken
,
I
know
Miss
Buerstner
very
well
*NL*
and
there
is
no
truth
at
all
in
what
you
say
.
And
what
's
more
,
perhaps
*NL*
I
'm
going
to
far
,
I
do
n't
want
to
get
in
your
way
,
say
to
her
whatever
*NL*
you
see
fit
.
Good
night
.
''
``
Mr.
K.
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grubach
as
if
asking
him
*NL*
for
something
and
hurrying
to
his
door
which
he
had
already
opened
,
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
to
speak
to
Miss
Buerstner
at
all
,
not
yet
,
of
course
I
'll
*NL*
continue
to
keep
an
eye
on
her
but
you
're
the
only
one
I
've
told
what
I
*NL*
know
.
And
it
is
,
after
all
something
that
everyone
who
lets
rooms
has
*NL*
to
do
if
she
's
to
keep
the
house
decent
,
that
's
all
I
'm
trying
to
do
.
''
*NL*
``
Decent
!
''
called
out
K.
through
the
crack
in
the
door
,
``
if
you
want
to
*NL*
keep
the
house
decent
you
'll
first
have
to
give
me
notice
.
''
Then
he
*NL*
slammed
the
door
shut
,
there
was
a
gentle
knocking
to
which
he
paid
no
*NL*
more
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
feel
at
all
like
going
to
bed
,
so
he
decided
to
stay
*NL*
up
,
and
this
would
also
give
him
the
chance
to
find
out
when
Miss
*NL*
Buerstner
would
arrive
home
.
Perhaps
it
would
also
still
be
possible
,
*NL*
even
if
a
little
inappropriate
,
to
have
a
few
words
with
her
.
As
he
lay
*NL*
there
by
the
window
,
pressing
his
hands
to
his
tired
eyes
,
he
even
*NL*
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
might
punish
Mrs.
Grubach
by
persuading
*NL*
Miss
Buerstner
to
give
in
her
notice
at
the
same
time
as
he
would
.
But
*NL*
he
immediately
realised
that
that
would
be
shockingly
excessive
,
and
*NL*
there
would
even
be
the
suspicion
that
he
was
moving
house
because
of
*NL*
the
incidents
of
that
morning
.
Nothing
would
have
been
more
nonsensical
*NL*
and
,
above
all
,
more
pointless
and
contemptible
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
become
tired
of
looking
out
onto
the
empty
street
he
*NL*
slightly
opened
the
door
to
the
living
room
so
that
he
could
see
anyone
*NL*
who
entered
the
flat
from
where
he
was
and
lay
down
on
the
couch
.
He
*NL*
lay
there
,
quietly
smoking
a
cigar
,
until
about
eleven
o'clock
.
He
*NL*
was
n't
able
to
hold
out
longer
than
that
,
and
went
a
little
way
into
the
*NL*
hallway
as
if
in
that
way
he
could
make
Miss
Buerstner
arrive
sooner
.
He
*NL*
had
no
particular
desire
for
her
,
he
could
not
even
remember
what
she
*NL*
looked
like
,
but
now
he
wanted
to
speak
to
her
and
it
irritated
him
that
*NL*
her
late
arrival
home
meant
this
day
would
be
full
of
unease
and
*NL*
disorder
right
to
its
very
end
.
It
was
also
her
fault
that
he
had
not
*NL*
had
any
dinner
that
evening
and
that
he
had
been
unable
to
visit
Elsa
as
*NL*
he
had
intended
.
He
could
still
make
up
for
both
of
those
things
,
*NL*
though
,
if
he
went
to
the
wine
bar
where
Elsa
worked
.
He
wanted
to
do
*NL*
so
even
later
,
after
the
discussion
with
Miss
Buerstner
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
already
gone
half
past
eleven
when
someone
could
be
heard
*NL*
in
the
stairway
.
K.
,
who
had
been
lost
in
his
thoughts
in
the
hallway
,
*NL*
walking
up
and
down
loudly
as
if
it
were
his
own
room
,
fled
behind
his
*NL*
door
.
Miss
Buerstner
had
arrived
.
Shivering
,
she
pulled
a
silk
shawl
*NL*
over
her
slender
shoulders
as
she
locked
the
door
.
The
next
moment
she
*NL*
would
certainly
go
into
her
room
,
where
K.
ought
not
to
intrude
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
night
;
that
meant
he
would
have
to
speak
to
her
now
,
but
,
*NL*
unfortunately
,
he
had
not
put
the
electric
light
on
in
his
room
so
that
*NL*
when
he
stepped
out
of
the
dark
it
would
give
the
impression
of
being
an
*NL*
attack
and
would
certainly
,
at
the
very
least
,
have
been
quite
alarming
.
*NL*
There
was
no
time
to
lose
,
and
in
his
helplessness
he
whispered
through
*NL*
the
crack
of
the
door
,
``
Miss
Buerstner
.
''
It
sounded
like
he
was
pleading
*NL*
with
her
,
not
calling
to
her
.
``
Is
there
someone
there
?
''
asked
Miss
*NL*
Buerstner
,
looking
round
with
her
eyes
wide
open
.
``
It
's
me
,
''
said
K.
and
*NL*
came
out
.
``
Oh
,
Mr.
K.
!
''
said
Miss
Buerstner
with
a
smile
.
``
Good
*NL*
Evening
,
''
and
offered
him
her
hand
.
``
I
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
you
,
*NL*
if
you
would
allow
me
?
''
``
Now
?
''
asked
Miss
Buerstner
,
``
does
it
have
to
be
*NL*
now
?
It
is
a
little
odd
,
is
n't
it
?
''
``
I
've
been
waiting
for
you
since
*NL*
nine
o'clock
.
''
``
Well
,
I
was
at
the
theatre
,
I
did
n't
know
anything
*NL*
about
you
waiting
for
me
.
''
``
The
reason
I
need
to
speak
to
you
only
came
*NL*
up
today
''
``
I
see
,
well
I
do
n't
see
why
not
,
I
suppose
,
apart
from
being
*NL*
so
tired
I
could
drop
.
Come
into
my
room
for
a
few
minutes
then
.
We
*NL*
certainly
ca
n't
talk
out
here
,
we
'd
wake
everyone
up
and
I
think
that
*NL*
would
be
more
unpleasant
for
us
than
for
them
.
Wait
here
till
I
've
put
*NL*
the
light
on
in
my
room
,
and
then
turn
the
light
down
out
here
.
''
K.
did
*NL*
as
he
was
told
,
and
then
even
waited
until
Miss
Buerstner
came
out
of
her
*NL*
room
and
quietly
invited
him
,
once
more
,
to
come
in
.
``
Sit
down
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
indicating
the
ottoman
,
while
she
herself
remained
standing
by
the
*NL*
bedpost
despite
the
tiredness
she
had
spoken
of
;
she
did
not
even
take
*NL*
off
her
hat
,
which
was
small
but
decorated
with
an
abundance
of
flowers
.
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
wanted
,
then
?
I
'm
really
quite
curious
.
''
She
gently
*NL*
crossed
her
legs
.
*NL*
``
I
expect
you
'll
say
,
''
K.
began
,
``
that
the
matter
really
is
n't
all
that
*NL*
urgent
and
we
do
n't
need
to
talk
about
it
right
now
,
but
...
''
``
I
never
*NL*
listen
to
introductions
,
''
said
Miss
Buerstner
.
``
That
makes
my
job
so
*NL*
much
easier
,
''
said
K.
``
This
morning
,
to
some
extent
through
my
fault
,
*NL*
your
room
was
made
a
little
untidy
,
this
happened
because
of
people
I
*NL*
did
not
know
and
against
my
will
but
,
as
I
said
,
because
of
my
fault
;
I
*NL*
wanted
to
apologise
for
it
.
''
``
My
room
?
''
asked
Miss
Buerstner
,
and
*NL*
instead
of
looking
round
the
room
scrutinised
K.
``
It
is
true
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
and
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
they
looked
each
other
in
the
eyes
,
*NL*
``
there
's
no
point
in
saying
exactly
how
this
came
about
.
''
``
But
that
's
*NL*
the
interesting
thing
about
it
,
''
said
Miss
Buerstner
.
``
No
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
Miss
Buerstner
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
force
my
way
into
any
*NL*
secrets
,
if
you
insist
that
it
's
of
no
interest
I
wo
n't
insist
.
I
'm
*NL*
quite
happy
to
forgive
you
for
it
,
as
you
ask
,
especially
as
I
ca
n't
see
*NL*
anything
at
all
that
's
been
left
untidy
.
''
With
her
hand
laid
flat
on
*NL*
her
lower
hip
,
she
made
a
tour
around
the
room
.
At
the
mat
where
the
*NL*
photographs
were
she
stopped
.
``
Look
at
this
!
''
she
cried
.
``
My
*NL*
photographs
really
have
been
put
in
the
wrong
places
.
Oh
,
that
's
*NL*
horrible
.
Someone
really
has
been
in
my
room
without
permission
.
''
K.
*NL*
nodded
,
and
quietly
cursed
Kaminer
who
worked
at
his
bank
and
who
was
*NL*
always
active
doing
things
that
had
neither
use
nor
purpose
.
``
It
is
*NL*
odd
,
''
said
Miss
Buerstner
,
``
that
I
'm
forced
to
forbid
you
to
do
something
*NL*
that
you
ought
to
have
forbidden
yourself
to
do
,
namely
to
come
into
my
*NL*
room
when
I
'm
not
here
.
''
``
But
I
did
explain
to
you
,
''
said
K.
,
and
went
*NL*
over
to
join
her
by
the
photographs
,
``
that
it
was
n't
me
who
interfered
*NL*
with
your
photographs
;
but
as
you
do
n't
believe
me
I
'll
have
to
admit
*NL*
that
the
investigating
committee
brought
along
three
bank
employees
with
*NL*
them
,
one
of
them
must
have
touched
your
photographs
and
as
soon
as
I
*NL*
get
the
chance
I
'll
ask
to
have
him
dismissed
from
the
bank
.
Yes
,
there
*NL*
was
an
investigating
committee
here
,
''
added
K.
,
as
the
young
lady
was
*NL*
looking
at
him
enquiringly
.
``
Because
of
you
?
''
she
asked
.
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
answered
K.
``
No
!
''
the
lady
cried
with
a
laugh
.
``
Yes
,
they
were
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
,
``
you
believe
that
I
'm
innocent
then
,
do
you
?
''
``
Well
now
,
innocent
*NL*
...
''
said
the
lady
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
start
making
any
pronouncements
*NL*
that
might
have
serious
consequences
,
I
do
n't
really
know
you
after
all
,
*NL*
it
means
they
're
dealing
with
a
serious
criminal
if
they
send
an
*NL*
investigating
committee
straight
out
to
get
him
.
But
you
're
not
in
*NL*
custody
now
-
at
least
I
take
it
you
've
not
escaped
from
prison
*NL*
considering
that
you
seem
quite
calm
-
so
you
ca
n't
have
committed
any
*NL*
crime
of
that
sort
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
K.
,
``
but
it
might
be
that
the
*NL*
investigating
committee
could
see
that
I
'm
innocent
,
or
not
so
guilty
as
*NL*
had
been
supposed
.
''
``
Yes
,
that
's
certainly
a
possibility
,
''
said
Miss
*NL*
Buerstner
,
who
seemed
very
interested
.
``
Listen
,
''
said
K.
,
``
you
do
n't
*NL*
have
much
experience
in
legal
matters
.
''
``
No
,
that
's
true
,
I
do
n't
,
''
*NL*
said
Miss
Buerstner
,
``
and
I
've
often
regretted
it
,
as
I
'd
like
to
know
*NL*
everything
and
I
'm
very
interested
in
legal
matters
.
There
's
something
*NL*
peculiarly
attractive
about
the
law
,
is
n't
there
?
But
I
'll
certainly
be
*NL*
perfecting
my
knowledge
in
this
area
,
as
next
month
I
start
work
in
a
*NL*
legal
office
.
''
``
That
's
very
good
,
''
said
K.
,
``
that
means
you
'll
be
able
*NL*
to
give
me
some
help
with
my
trial
.
''
``
That
could
well
be
,
''
said
Miss
*NL*
Buerstner
,
``
why
not
?
I
like
to
make
use
of
what
I
know
.
''
``
I
mean
it
*NL*
quite
seriously
,
''
said
K.
,
``
or
at
least
,
half
seriously
,
as
you
do

*NL*
This
affair
is
too
petty
to
call
in
a
lawyer
,
but
I
could
make
good
use
*NL*
of
someone
who
could
give
me
advice
.
''
``
Yes
,
but
if
I
'm
to
give
you
*NL*
advice
I
'll
have
to
know
what
it
's
all
about
,

said
Miss
Buerstner
.
*NL*
``
That
's
exactly
the
problem
,
''
said
K.
,
``
I
do
n't
know
that
myself
.
''
``
So
*NL*
you
have
been
making
fun
of
me
,
then
,
''
said
Miss
Buerstner
exceedingly
*NL*
disappointed
,
``
you
really
ought
not
to
try
something
like
that
on
at
*NL*
this
time
of
night
.
''
And
she
stepped
away
from
the
photographs
where
*NL*
they
had
stood
so
long
together
.
``
Miss
Buerstner
,
no
,
''
said
K.
,
``
I
'm
not
*NL*
making
fun
of
you

Please
believe
me
!
I
've
already
told
you
everything

I
know

More
than
I
know
,
in
fact
,
as
it
actually
was
n't
even
an
*NL*
investigating
committee
,
that
's
just
what
I
called
them
because
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
else
to
call
them
.
There
was
no
cross
questioning
at
all
,
I
*NL*
was
merely
arrested
,
but
by
a
committee
.
''
Miss
Buerstner
sat
on
the
*NL*
ottoman
and
laughed
again
.
``
What
was
it
like
then
?
''
she
asked
.
``
It
was
*NL*
terrible
''
said
K.
,
although
his
mind
was
no
longer
on
the
subject
,
he
*NL*
had
become
totally
absorbed
by
Miss
Buerstner
's
gaze
who
was
supporting
*NL*
her
chin
on
one
hand
-
the
elbow
rested
on
the
cushion
of
the
ottoman
-
*NL*
and
slowly
stroking
her
hip
with
the
other
.
``
That
's
too
vague
,
''
said
*NL*
Miss
Buerstner
.
``
What
's
too
vague
?
''
asked
K
.
Then
he
remembered
himself
*NL*
and
asked
,
``
Would
you
like
me
to
show
you
what
it
was
like
?
''
He
wanted
*NL*
to
move
in
some
way
but
did
not
want
to
leave
.
``
I
'm
already
tired
,
''
*NL*
said
Miss
Buerstner
.
``
You
arrived
back
so
late
,
''
said
K.
``
Now
you
've
*NL*
started
telling
me
off

Well
I
suppose
I
deserve
it
as
I
should
n't
have
*NL*
let
you
in
here
in
the
first
place
,
and
it
turns
out
there
was
n't
even
*NL*
any
point

''
``
Oh
,
there
was
a
point
,
you
'll
see
now
how
important
a
*NL*
point
it
was
,

said
K.
``
May
I
move
this
table
away
from
your
bedside
*NL*
and
put
it
here
?
''
``
What
do
you
think
you
're
doing
?
''
said
Miss
Buerstner
.
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
ca
n't
!
''
``
In
that
case
I
ca
n't
show
you
,
''
said
K.
,
quite
*NL*
upset
,
as
if
Miss
Buerstner
had
committed
some
incomprehensible
offence
*NL*
against
him
.
``
Alright
then
,
if
you
need
it
to
show
what
you
mean
,
just
*NL*
take
the
bedside
table
then
,
''
said
Miss
Buerstner
,
and
after
a
short
*NL*
pause
added
in
a
weak
voice
,
``
I
'm
so
tired
I
'm
allowing
more
than
I
*NL*
ought
to
.
''
K.
put
the
little
table
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
sat
*NL*
down
behind
it
.
``
You
have
to
get
a
proper
idea
of
where
the
people
were
*NL*
situated
,
it
is
very
interesting
.
I
'm
the
supervisor
,
sitting
over
*NL*
there
on
the
chest
are
two
policemen
,
standing
next
to
the
photographs
*NL*
there
are
three
young
people
.
Hanging
on
the
handle
of
the
window
is
a
*NL*
white
blouse
-
I
just
mention
that
by
the
way
.
And
now
it
begins
.
Ah
*NL*
yes
,
I
'm
forgetting
myself
,
the
most
important
person
of
all
,
so
I
'm
*NL*
standing
here
in
front
of
the
table
.
The
supervisor
is
sitting
*NL*
extremely
comfortably
with
his
legs
crossed
and
his
arm
hanging
over
the
*NL*
backrest
here
like
some
layabout
.
And
now
it
really
does
begin
.
The
*NL*
supervisor
calls
out
as
if
he
had
to
wake
me
up
,
in
fact
he
shouts
at
*NL*
me
,
I
'm
afraid
,
if
I
'm
to
make
it
clear
to
you
,
I
'll
have
to
shout
as
*NL*
well
,
and
it
's
nothing
more
than
my
name
that
he
shouts
out
.
''
Miss
*NL*
Buerstner
,
laughing
as
she
listened
to
him
,
laid
her
forefinger
on
her
*NL*
mouth
so
that
K.
would
not
shout
,
but
it
was
too
late
.
K.
was
too
*NL*
engrossed
in
his
role
and
slowly
called
out
,
``
Josef
K.
!
''
.
It
was
not
as
*NL*
loud
as
he
had
threatened
,
but
nonetheless
,
once
he
had
suddenly
called
*NL*
it
out
,
the
cry
seemed
gradually
to
spread
itself
all
round
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
series
of
loud
,
curt
and
regular
knocks
at
the
door
of
*NL*
the
adjoining
room
.
Miss
Buerstner
went
pale
and
laid
her
hand
on
her
*NL*
heart
.
K.
was
especially
startled
,
as
for
a
moment
he
had
been
quite
*NL*
unable
to
think
of
anything
other
than
the
events
of
that
morning
and
*NL*
the
girl
for
whom
he
was
performing
them
.
He
had
hardly
pulled
himself
*NL*
together
when
he
jumped
over
to
Miss
Buerstner
and
took
her
hand
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
be
afraid
,
''
he
whispered
,
``
I
'll
put
everything
right
.
But
who
can
it
*NL*
be
?
It
's
only
the
living
room
next
door
,
nobody
sleeps
in
there
.
''
``
Yes
*NL*
they
do
,
''
whispered
Miss
Buerstner
into
K.
's
ear
,
``
a
nephew
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Grubach
's
,
an
captain
in
the
army
,
has
been
sleeping
there
since
*NL*
yesterday
.
There
's
no
other
room
free
.
I
'd
forgotten
about
it
too
.
*NL*
Why
did
you
have
to
shout
like
that
?
You
've
made
me
quite
upset
.
''
*NL*
``
There
is
no
reason
for
it
,
''
said
K.
,
and
,
now
as
she
sank
back
onto
the
*NL*
cushion
,
kissed
her
forehead
.
``
Go
away
,
go
away
,
''
she
said
,
hurriedly
*NL*
sitting
back
up
,
``
get
out
of
here
,
go
,
what
is
it
you
want
,
he
's
*NL*
listening
at
the
door
he
can
hear
everything
.
You
're
causing
me
so
much
*NL*
trouble
!
''
``
I
wo
n't
go
,
''
said
K.
,
``
until
you
've
calmed
down
a
bit
.
Come
*NL*
over
into
the
other
corner
of
the
room
,
he
wo
n't
be
able
to
hear
us
*NL*
there
.
''
She
let
him
lead
her
there
.
``
Do
n't
forget
,
''
he
said
,
``
although
*NL*
this
might
be
unpleasant
for
you
you
're
not
in
any
real
danger
.
You
*NL*
know
how
much
esteem
Mrs.
Grubach
has
for
me
,
she
's
the
one
who
will
*NL*
make
all
the
decisions
in
this
,
especially
as
the
captain
is
her
nephew
,
*NL*
but
she
believes
everything
I
say
without
question
.
What
's
more
,
she
*NL*
has
borrowed
a
large
sum
of
money
from
me
and
that
makes
her
dependent
*NL*
on
me
.
I
will
confirm
whatever
you
say
to
explain
our
being
here
*NL*
together
,
however
inappropriate
it
might
be
,
and
I
guarantee
to
make
*NL*
sure
that
Mrs.
Grubach
will
not
only
say
she
believes
the
explanation
in
*NL*
public
but
will
believe
it
truly
and
sincerely
.
You
will
have
no
need
*NL*
to
consider
me
in
any
way
.
If
you
wish
to
let
it
be
known
that
I
have
*NL*
attacked
you
then
Mrs.
Grubach
will
be
informed
of
such
and
she
will
*NL*
believe
it
without
even
losing
her
trust
in
me
,
that
's
how
much
respect
*NL*
she
has
for
me
.
''
Miss
Buerstner
looked
at
the
floor
in
front
of
her
,
*NL*
quiet
and
a
little
sunk
in
on
herself
.
``
Why
would
Mrs.
Grubach
not
*NL*
believe
that
I
've
attacked
you
?
''
added
K
.
He
looked
at
her
hair
in
front
*NL*
of
him
,
parted
,
bunched
down
,
reddish
and
firmly
held
in
place
.
He
*NL*
thought
she
would
look
up
at
him
,
but
without
changing
her
manner
she
*NL*
said
,
``
Forgive
me
,
but
it
was
the
suddenness
of
the
knocking
that
*NL*
startled
me
so
much
,
not
so
much
what
the
consequences
of
the
captain
*NL*
being
here
might
be
.
It
was
all
so
quiet
after
you
'd
shouted
,
and
then
*NL*
there
was
the
knocking
,
that
's
was
made
me
so
shocked
,
and
I
was
sitting
*NL*
right
by
the
door
,
the
knocking
was
right
next
to
me
.
Thank
you
for
*NL*
your
suggestions
,
but
I
wo
n't
accept
them
.
I
can
bear
the
*NL*
responsibility
for
anything
that
happens
in
my
room
myself
,
and
I
can
do
*NL*
so
with
anyone
.
I
'm
surprised
you
do
n't
realise
just
how
insulting
your
*NL*
suggestions
are
and
what
they
imply
about
me
,
although
I
certainly
*NL*
acknowledge
your
good
intentions
.
But
now
,
please
go
,
leave
me
alone
,
I
*NL*
need
you
to
go
now
even
more
than
I
did
earlier
.
The
couple
of
minutes
*NL*
you
asked
for
have
grown
into
half
an
hour
,
more
than
half
an
hour
now
.
''
*NL*
K.
took
hold
of
her
hand
,
and
then
of
her
wrist
,
``
You
're
not
cross
with
*NL*
me
,
though
?
''
he
said
.
She
pulled
her
hand
away
and
answered
,
``
No
,
no
,
*NL*
I
'm
never
cross
with
anyone
.
''
He
grasped
her
wrist
once
more
,
she
*NL*
tolerated
it
now
and
,
in
that
way
,
lead
him
to
the
door
.
He
had
fully
*NL*
intended
to
leave
.
But
when
he
reached
the
door
he
came
to
a
halt
as
if
*NL*
he
had
n't
expected
to
find
a
door
there
,
Miss
Buerstner
made
use
of
that
*NL*
moment
to
get
herself
free
,
open
the
door
,
slip
out
into
the
hallway
and
*NL*
gently
say
to
K.
from
there
,
``
Now
,
come
along
,
please
.
Look
,
''
she
*NL*
pointed
to
the
captain
's
door
,
from
under
which
there
was
a
light
*NL*
shining
,
``
he
's
put
a
light
on
and
he
's
laughing
at
us
.
''
``
Alright
,
I
'm
*NL*
coming
,
''
said
K.
,
moved
forward
,
took
hold
of
her
,
kissed
her
on
the
*NL*
mouth
and
then
over
her
whole
face
like
a
thirsty
animal
lapping
with
*NL*
its
tongue
when
it
eventually
finds
water
.
He
finally
kissed
her
on
her
*NL*
neck
and
her
throat
and
left
his
lips
pressed
there
for
a
long
time
.
He
*NL*
did
not
look
up
until
there
was
a
noise
from
the
captain
's
room
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
go
now
,
''
he
said
,
he
wanted
to
address
Miss
Buerstner
by
her
Christian
*NL*
name
,
but
did
not
know
it
.
She
gave
him
a
tired
nod
,
offered
him
her
*NL*
hand
to
kiss
as
she
turned
away
as
if
she
did
not
know
what
she
was
*NL*
doing
,
and
went
back
into
her
room
with
her
head
bowed
.
A
short
while
*NL*
later
,
K.
was
lying
in
his
bed
.
He
very
soon
went
to
sleep
,
but
before
*NL*
he
did
he
thought
a
little
while
about
his
behaviour
,
he
was
satisfied
*NL*
with
it
but
felt
some
surprise
that
he
was
not
more
satisfied
;
he
was
*NL*
seriously
worried
about
Miss
Buerstner
because
of
the
captain
.

*NL*
Chapter
Two
*NL*
First
Cross-examination
*NL*
*NL*
K.
was
informed
by
telephone
that
there
would
be
a
small
hearing
*NL*
concerning
his
case
the
following
Sunday
.
He
was
made
aware
that
these
*NL*
cross
examinations
would
follow
one
another
regularly
,
perhaps
not
every
*NL*
week
but
quite
frequently
.
On
the
one
hand
it
was
in
everyone
's
interest
*NL*
to
bring
proceedings
quickly
to
their
conclusion
,
but
on
the
other
hand
*NL*
every
aspect
of
the
examinations
had
to
be
carried
out
thoroughly
*NL*
without
lasting
too
long
because
of
the
associated
stress
.
For
these
*NL*
reasons
,
it
had
been
decided
to
hold
a
series
of
brief
examinations
*NL*
following
on
one
after
another
.
Sunday
had
been
chosen
as
the
day
for
*NL*
the
hearings
so
that
K.
would
not
be
disturbed
in
his
professional
work
.
*NL*
It
was
assumed
that
he
would
be
in
agreement
with
this
,
but
if
he
wished
*NL*
for
another
date
then
,
as
far
as
possible
,
he
would
be
accommodated
.
*NL*
Cross-examinations
could
even
be
held
in
the
night
,
for
instance
,
but
K.
*NL*
would
probably
not
be
fresh
enough
at
that
time
.
Anyway
,
as
long
as
K.
*NL*
made
no
objection
,
the
hearing
would
be
left
on
Sundays
.
It
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
course
that
he
would
have
to
appear
without
fail
,
there
was
*NL*
probably
no
need
to
point
this
out
to
him
.
He
would
be
given
the
number
*NL*
of
the
building
where
he
was
to
present
himself
,
which
was
in
a
street
*NL*
in
a
suburb
well
away
from
the
city
centre
which
K.
had
never
been
to
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
had
received
this
notice
,
K.
hung
up
the
receiver
without
*NL*
giving
an
answer
;
he
had
decided
immediately
to
go
there
that
Sunday
,
it
*NL*
was
certainly
necessary
,
proceedings
had
begun
and
he
had
to
face
up
to
*NL*
it
,
and
this
first
examination
would
probably
also
be
the
last
.
He
was
*NL*
still
standing
in
thought
by
the
telephone
when
he
heard
the
voice
of
*NL*
the
deputy
director
behind
him
-
he
wanted
to
use
the
telephone
but
K.
*NL*
stood
in
his
way
.
``
Bad
news
?
''
asked
the
deputy
director
casually
,
not
*NL*
in
order
to
find
anything
out
but
just
to
get
K.
away
from
the
device
.
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
K.
,
he
stepped
to
one
side
but
did
not
go
away
entirely
.
*NL*
The
deputy
director
picked
up
the
receiver
and
,
as
he
waited
for
his
*NL*
connection
,
turned
away
from
it
and
said
to
K.
,
``
One
question
,
Mr.
K.
:
*NL*
Would
you
like
to
give
me
the
pleasure
of
joining
me
on
my
sailing
boat
*NL*
on
Sunday
morning
?
There
's
quite
a
few
people
coming
,
you
're
bound
to
*NL*
know
some
of
them
.
One
of
them
is
Hasterer
,
the
state
attorney
.
Would
*NL*
you
like
to
come
along
?
Do
come
along
!
''
K.
tried
to
pay
attention
to
*NL*
what
the
deputy
director
was
saying
.
It
was
of
no
small
importance
for
*NL*
him
,
as
this
invitation
from
the
deputy
director
,
with
whom
he
had
never
*NL*
got
on
very
well
,
meant
that
he
was
trying
to
improve
his
relations
with
*NL*
him
.
It
showed
how
important
K.
had
become
in
the
bank
and
how
its
*NL*
second
most
important
official
seemed
to
value
his
friendship
,
or
at
*NL*
least
his
impartiality
.
He
was
only
speaking
at
the
side
of
the
*NL*
telephone
receiver
while
he
waited
for
his
connection
,
but
in
giving
*NL*
this
invitation
the
deputy
director
was
humbling
himself
.
But
K.
would
*NL*
have
to
humiliate
him
a
second
time
as
a
result
,
he
said
,
``
Thank
you
*NL*
very
much
,
but
I
'm
afraid
I
will
have
no
time
on
Sunday
,
I
have
a
*NL*
previous
obligation
.
''
``
Pity
,
''
said
the
deputy
director
,
and
turned
to
*NL*
the
telephone
conversation
that
had
just
been
connected
.
It
was
not
a
*NL*
short
conversation
,
but
K.
,
remained
standing
confused
by
the
instrument
*NL*
all
the
time
it
was
going
on
.
It
was
only
when
the
deputy
director
hung
*NL*
up
that
he
was
shocked
into
awareness
and
said
,
in
order
to
partially
*NL*
excuse
his
standing
there
for
no
reason
,
``
I
've
just
received
a
telephone
*NL*
call
,
there
's
somewhere
I
need
to
go
,
but
they
forgot
to
tell
me
what
*NL*
time
.
''
``
Ask
them
then
,
''
said
the
deputy
director
.
``
It
's
not
that
*NL*
important
,
''
said
K.
,
although
in
that
way
his
earlier
excuse
,
already
*NL*
weak
enough
,
was
made
even
weaker
.
As
he
went
,
the
deputy
director
*NL*
continued
to
speak
about
other
things
.
K.
forced
himself
to
answer
,
but
*NL*
his
thoughts
were
mainly
about
that
Sunday
,
how
it
would
be
best
to
get
*NL*
there
for
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
as
that
was
the
time
that
courts
*NL*
always
start
work
on
weekdays
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
weather
was
dull
on
Sunday
.
K.
was
very
tired
,
as
he
had
*NL*
stayed
out
drinking
until
late
in
the
night
celebrating
with
some
of
the
*NL*
regulars
,
and
he
had
almost
overslept
.
He
dressed
hurriedly
,
without
*NL*
the
time
to
think
and
assemble
the
various
plans
he
had
worked
out
*NL*
during
the
week
.
With
no
breakfast
,
he
rushed
to
the
suburb
he
had
been
*NL*
told
about
.
Oddly
enough
,
although
he
had
little
time
to
look
around
*NL*
him
,
he
came
across
the
three
bank
officials
involved
in
his
case
,
*NL*
Rabensteiner
,
Kullich
and
Kaminer
.
The
first
two
were
travelling
in
a
*NL*
tram
that
went
across
K.
's
route
,
but
Kaminer
sat
on
the
terrace
of
a
*NL*
cafe
and
leant
curiously
over
the
wall
as
K.
came
over
.
All
of
them
*NL*
seemed
to
be
looking
at
him
,
surprised
at
seeing
their
superior
running
;
*NL*
it
was
a
kind
of
pride
that
made
K.
want
to
go
on
foot
,
this
was
his
*NL*
affair
and
the
idea
of
any
help
from
strangers
,
however
slight
,
was
*NL*
repulsive
to
him
,
he
also
wanted
to
avoid
asking
for
anyone
's
help
*NL*
because
that
would
initiate
them
into
the
affair
even
if
only
slightly
.
*NL*
And
after
all
,
he
had
no
wish
at
all
to
humiliate
himself
before
the
*NL*
committee
by
being
too
punctual
.
Anyway
,
now
he
was
running
so
that
he
*NL*
would
get
there
by
nine
o'clock
if
at
all
possible
,
even
though
he
had
*NL*
no
appointment
for
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
thought
that
he
would
recognise
the
building
from
a
*NL*
distance
by
some
kind
of
sign
,
without
knowing
exactly
what
the
sign
*NL*
would
look
like
,
or
from
some
particular
kind
of
activity
outside
the
*NL*
entrance
.
K.
had
been
told
that
the
building
was
in
Juliusstrasse
,
but
*NL*
when
he
stood
at
the
street
's
entrance
it
consisted
on
each
side
of
*NL*
almost
nothing
but
monotonous
,
grey
constructions
,
tall
blocks
of
flats
*NL*
occupied
by
poor
people
.
Now
,
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
most
of
the
windows
*NL*
were
occupied
,
men
in
their
shirtsleeves
leant
out
smoking
,
or
carefully
*NL*
and
gently
held
small
children
on
the
sills
.
Other
windows
were
piled
*NL*
up
with
bedding
,
above
which
the
dishevelled
head
of
a
woman
would
*NL*
briefly
appear
.
People
called
out
to
each
other
across
the
street
,
one
*NL*
of
the
calls
provoked
a
loud
laugh
about
K.
himself
.
It
was
a
long
*NL*
street
,
and
spaced
evenly
along
it
were
small
shops
below
street
level
,
*NL*
selling
various
kinds
of
foodstuffs
,
which
you
reached
by
going
down
a
*NL*
few
steps
.
Women
went
in
and
out
of
them
or
stood
chatting
on
the
*NL*
steps
.
A
fruitmonger
,
taking
his
goods
up
to
the
windows
,
was
just
as
*NL*
inattentive
as
K.
and
nearly
knocked
him
down
with
his
cart
.
Just
then
,
*NL*
a
gramophone
,
which
in
better
parts
of
town
would
have
been
seen
as
worn
*NL*
out
,
began
to
play
some
murderous
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
K.
went
further
into
the
street
,
slowly
,
as
if
he
had
plenty
of
*NL*
time
now
,
or
as
if
the
examining
magistrate
were
looking
at
him
from
one
*NL*
of
the
windows
and
therefore
knew
that
K.
had
found
his
way
there
.
It
*NL*
was
shortly
after
nine
.
The
building
was
quite
far
down
the
street
,
it
*NL*
covered
so
much
area
it
was
almost
extraordinary
,
and
the
gateway
in
*NL*
particular
was
tall
and
long
.
It
was
clearly
intended
for
delivery
*NL*
wagons
belonging
to
the
various
warehouses
all
round
the
yard
which
were
*NL*
now
locked
up
and
carried
the
names
of
companies
some
of
which
K.
knew
*NL*
from
his
work
at
the
bank
.
In
contrast
with
his
usual
habits
,
he
*NL*
remained
standing
a
while
at
the
entrance
to
the
yard
taking
in
all
*NL*
these
external
details
.
Near
him
,
there
was
a
bare-footed
man
sitting
*NL*
on
a
crate
and
reading
a
newspaper
.
There
were
two
lads
swinging
on
a
*NL*
hand
cart
.
In
front
of
a
pump
stood
a
weak
,
young
girl
in
a
bedjacket
*NL*
who
,
as
the
water
flowed
into
her
can
,
looked
at
K
.
There
was
a
piece
*NL*
of
rope
stretched
between
two
windows
in
a
corner
of
the
yard
,
with
some
*NL*
washing
hanging
on
it
to
dry
.
A
man
stood
below
it
calling
out
*NL*
instructions
to
direct
the
work
being
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
K.
went
over
to
the
stairway
to
get
to
the
room
where
the
hearing
*NL*
was
to
take
place
,
but
then
stood
still
again
as
besides
these
steps
he
*NL*
could
see
three
other
stairway
entrances
,
and
there
also
seemed
to
be
a
*NL*
small
passageway
at
the
end
of
the
yard
leading
into
a
second
yard
.
It
*NL*
irritated
him
that
he
had
not
been
given
more
precise
directions
to
the
*NL*
room
,
it
meant
they
were
either
being
especially
neglectful
with
him
or
*NL*
especially
indifferent
,
and
he
decided
to
make
that
clear
to
them
very
*NL*
loudly
and
very
unambiguously
.
In
the
end
he
decided
to
climb
up
the
*NL*
stairs
,
his
thoughts
playing
on
something
that
he
remembered
the
*NL*
policeman
,
Willem
,
saying
to
him
;
that
the
court
is
attracted
by
the
*NL*
guilt
,
from
which
it
followed
that
the
courtroom
must
be
on
the
stairway
*NL*
that
K.
selected
by
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
up
he
disturbed
a
large
group
of
children
playing
on
*NL*
the
stairs
who
looked
at
him
as
he
stepped
through
their
rows
.
``
Next
*NL*
time
I
come
here
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
must
either
bring
sweets
with
*NL*
me
to
make
them
like
me
or
a
stick
to
hit
them
with
.
''
Just
before
he
*NL*
reached
the
first
landing
he
even
had
to
wait
a
little
while
until
a
*NL*
ball
had
finished
its
movement
,
two
small
lads
with
sly
faces
like
*NL*
grown-up
scoundrels
held
him
by
his
trouser-legs
until
it
had
;
if
he
*NL*
were
to
shake
them
off
he
would
have
to
hurt
them
,
and
he
was
afraid
of
*NL*
what
noise
they
would
make
by
shouting
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
first
floor
,
his
search
began
for
real
.
He
still
felt
*NL*
unable
to
ask
for
the
investigating
committee
,
and
so
he
invented
a
*NL*
joiner
called
Lanz
-
that
name
occurred
to
him
because
the
captain
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Grubach
's
nephew
,
was
called
Lanz
-
so
that
he
could
ask
at
every
flat
*NL*
whether
Lanz
the
joiner
lived
there
and
thus
obtain
a
chance
to
look
*NL*
into
the
rooms
.
It
turned
out
,
though
,
that
that
was
mostly
possible
*NL*
without
further
ado
,
as
almost
all
the
doors
were
left
open
and
the
*NL*
children
ran
in
and
out
.
Most
of
them
were
small
,
one-windowed
rooms
*NL*
where
they
also
did
the
cooking
.
Many
women
held
babies
in
one
arm
and
*NL*
worked
at
the
stove
with
the
other
.
Half
grown
girls
,
who
seemed
to
be
*NL*
dressed
in
just
their
pinafores
worked
hardest
running
to
and
fro
.
In
*NL*
every
room
,
the
beds
were
still
in
use
by
people
who
were
ill
,
or
still
*NL*
asleep
,
or
people
stretched
out
on
them
in
their
clothes
.
K.
knocked
at
*NL*
the
flats
where
the
doors
were
closed
and
asked
whether
Lanz
the
joiner
*NL*
lived
there
.
It
was
usually
a
woman
who
opened
the
door
,
heard
the
*NL*
enquiry
and
turned
to
somebody
in
the
room
who
would
raise
himself
from
*NL*
the
bed
.
``
The
gentleman
's
asking
if
a
joiner
called
Lanz
,
lives
here
.
''
*NL*
``
A
joiner
,
called
Lanz
?
''
he
would
ask
from
the
bed
.
''
``
That
's
right
,
''
K.
*NL*
would
say
,
although
it
was
clear
that
the
investigating
committee
was
*NL*
not
to
be
found
there
,
and
so
his
task
was
at
an
end
.
There
were
many
*NL*
who
thought
it
must
be
very
important
for
K.
to
find
Lanz
the
joiner
and
*NL*
thought
long
about
it
,
naming
a
joiner
who
was
not
called
Lanz
or
giving
*NL*
a
name
that
had
some
vague
similarity
with
Lanz
,
or
they
asked
*NL*
neighbours
or
accompanied
K.
to
a
door
a
long
way
away
where
they
*NL*
thought
someone
of
that
sort
might
live
in
the
back
part
of
the
building
*NL*
or
where
someone
would
be
who
could
advise
K.
better
than
they
could
*NL*
themselves
.
K.
eventually
had
to
give
up
asking
if
he
did
not
want
to
*NL*
be
led
all
round
from
floor
to
floor
in
this
way
.
He
regretted
his
*NL*
initial
plan
,
which
had
at
first
seemed
so
practical
to
him
.
As
he
*NL*
reached
the
fifth
floor
,
he
decided
to
give
up
the
search
,
took
his
*NL*
leave
of
a
friendly
,
young
worker
who
wanted
to
lead
him
on
still
*NL*
further
and
went
down
the
stairs
.
But
then
the
thought
of
how
much
time
*NL*
he
was
wasting
made
him
cross
,
he
went
back
again
and
knocked
at
the
*NL*
first
door
on
the
fifth
floor
.
The
first
thing
he
saw
in
the
small
room
*NL*
was
a
large
clock
on
the
wall
which
already
showed
ten
o'clock
.
``
Is
*NL*
there
a
joiner
called
Lanz
who
lives
here
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Pardon
?
''
said
a
*NL*
young
woman
with
black
,
shining
eyes
who
was
,
at
that
moment
,
washing
*NL*
children
's
underclothes
in
a
bucket
.
She
pointed
her
wet
hand
towards
*NL*
the
open
door
of
the
adjoining
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
K.
thought
he
had
stepped
into
a
meeting
.
A
medium
sized
,
two
*NL*
windowed
room
was
filled
with
the
most
diverse
crowd
of
people
-
nobody
*NL*
paid
any
attention
to
the
person
who
had
just
entered
.
Close
under
its
*NL*
ceiling
it
was
surrounded
by
a
gallery
which
was
also
fully
occupied
and
*NL*
where
the
people
could
only
stand
bent
down
with
their
heads
and
their
*NL*
backs
touching
the
ceiling
.
K.
,
who
found
the
air
too
stuffy
,
stepped
*NL*
out
again
and
said
to
the
young
woman
,
who
had
probably
misunderstood
*NL*
what
he
had
said
,
``
I
asked
for
a
joiner
,
someone
by
the
name
of
Lanz
.
''
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
woman
,
``
please
go
on
in
.
''
K.
would
probably
not
have
*NL*
followed
her
if
the
woman
had
not
gone
up
to
him
,
taken
hold
of
the
door
*NL*
handle
and
said
,
``
I
'll
have
to
close
the
door
after
you
,
no-one
else
*NL*
will
be
allowed
in
.
''
``
Very
sensible
,
''
said
K.
,
``
but
it
's
too
full
*NL*
already
.
''
But
then
he
went
back
in
anyway
.
He
passed
through
between
*NL*
two
men
who
were
talking
beside
the
door
-
one
of
them
held
both
hands
*NL*
far
out
in
front
of
himself
making
the
movements
of
counting
out
money
,
*NL*
the
other
looked
him
closely
in
the
eyes
-
and
someone
took
him
by
the
*NL*
hand
.
It
was
a
small
,
red-faced
youth
.
``
Come
in
,
come
in
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
K.
let
himself
be
led
by
him
,
and
it
turned
out
that
there
was
-
*NL*
surprisingly
in
a
densely
packed
crowd
of
people
moving
to
and
fro
-
a
*NL*
narrow
passage
which
may
have
been
the
division
between
two
factions
;
*NL*
this
idea
was
reinforced
by
the
fact
that
in
the
first
few
rows
to
the
*NL*
left
and
the
right
of
him
there
was
hardly
any
face
looking
in
his
*NL*
direction
,
he
saw
nothing
but
the
backs
of
people
directing
their
speech
*NL*
and
their
movements
only
towards
members
of
their
own
side
.
Most
of
*NL*
them
were
dressed
in
black
,
in
old
,
long
,
formal
frock
coats
that
hung
*NL*
down
loosely
around
them
.
These
clothes
were
the
only
thing
that
*NL*
puzzled
K.
,
as
he
would
otherwise
have
taken
the
whole
assembly
for
a
*NL*
local
political
meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
other
end
of
the
hall
where
K.
had
been
led
there
was
a
*NL*
little
table
set
at
an
angle
on
a
very
low
podium
which
was
as
*NL*
overcrowded
as
everywhere
else
,
and
behind
the
table
,
near
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
podium
,
sat
a
small
,
fat
,
wheezing
man
who
was
talking
with
someone
*NL*
behind
him
.
This
second
man
was
standing
with
his
legs
crossed
and
his
*NL*
elbows
on
the
backrest
of
the
chair
,
provoking
much
laughter
.
From
time
*NL*
to
time
he
threw
his
arm
in
the
air
as
if
doing
a
caricature
of
someone
.
*NL*
The
youth
who
was
leading
K.
had
some
difficulty
in
reporting
to
the
*NL*
man
.
He
had
already
tried
twice
to
tell
him
something
,
standing
on
tip
-
*NL*
toe
,
but
without
getting
the
man
's
attention
as
he
sat
there
above
him
.
*NL*
It
was
only
when
one
of
the
people
up
on
the
podium
drew
his
attention
*NL*
to
the
youth
that
the
man
turned
to
him
and
leant
down
to
hear
what
it
*NL*
was
he
quietly
said
.
Then
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
quickly
looked
*NL*
over
at
K.
``
You
should
have
been
here
one
hour
and
five
minutes
ago
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
K.
was
going
to
give
him
a
reply
but
had
no
time
to
do
so
,
as
*NL*
hardly
had
the
man
spoken
than
a
general
muttering
arose
all
over
the
*NL*
right
hand
side
of
the
hall
.
``
You
should
have
been
here
one
hour
and
*NL*
five
minutes
ago
,
''
the
man
now
repeated
,
raising
his
voice
this
time
,
*NL*
and
quickly
looked
round
the
hall
beneath
him
.
The
muttering
also
*NL*
became
immediately
louder
and
,
as
the
man
said
nothing
more
,
died
away
*NL*
only
gradually
.
Now
the
hall
was
much
quieter
than
when
K.
had
entered
.
*NL*
Only
the
people
up
in
the
gallery
had
not
stopped
passing
remarks
.
As
*NL*
far
as
could
be
distinguished
,
up
in
the
half-darkness
,
dust
and
haze
,
*NL*
they
seemed
to
be
less
well
dressed
than
those
below
.
Many
of
them
had
*NL*
brought
pillows
that
they
had
put
between
their
heads
and
the
ceiling
so
*NL*
that
they
would
not
hurt
themselves
pressed
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
K.
had
decided
he
would
do
more
watching
than
talking
,
so
he
did
*NL*
not
defend
himself
for
supposedly
having
come
late
,
and
simply
said
,
*NL*
``
Well
maybe
I
have
arrived
late
,
I
'm
here
now
.
''
There
followed
loud
*NL*
applause
,
once
more
from
the
right
hand
side
of
the
hall
.
Easy
people
*NL*
to
get
on
your
side
,
thought
K.
,
and
was
bothered
only
by
the
quiet
from
*NL*
the
left
hand
side
which
was
directly
behind
him
and
from
which
there
*NL*
was
applause
from
only
a
few
individuals
.
He
wondered
what
he
could
say
*NL*
to
get
all
of
them
to
support
him
together
or
,
if
that
were
not
*NL*
possible
,
to
at
least
get
the
support
of
the
others
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
but
I
'm
now
no
longer
under
any
obligation
*NL*
to
hear
your
case
''
-
there
was
once
more
a
muttering
,
but
this
time
it
*NL*
was
misleading
as
the
man
waved
the
people
's
objections
aside
with
his
*NL*
hand
and
continued
-
``
I
will
,
however
,
as
an
exception
,
continue
with
it
*NL*
today
.
But
you
should
never
arrive
late
like
this
again
.
And
now
,
step
*NL*
forward
!
''
Someone
jumped
down
from
the
podium
so
that
there
would
be
a
*NL*
place
free
for
K.
,
and
K.
stepped
up
onto
it
.
He
stood
pressed
closely
*NL*
against
the
table
,
the
press
of
the
crowd
behind
him
was
so
great
that
*NL*
he
had
to
press
back
against
it
if
he
did
not
want
to
push
the
judge
's
*NL*
desk
down
off
the
podium
and
perhaps
the
judge
along
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
judge
,
however
,
paid
no
attention
to
that
but
sat
very
*NL*
comfortably
on
his
chair
and
,
after
saying
a
few
words
to
close
his
*NL*
discussion
with
the
man
behind
him
,
reached
for
a
little
note
book
,
the
*NL*
only
item
on
his
desk
.
It
was
like
an
old
school
exercise
book
and
had
*NL*
become
quite
misshapen
from
much
thumbing
.
``
Now
then
,
''
said
the
judge
,
*NL*
thumbing
through
the
book
.
He
turned
to
K.
with
the
tone
of
someone
who
*NL*
knows
his
facts
and
said
,
``
you
are
a
house
painter
?
''
``
No
,
''
said
K.
,
``
I
*NL*
am
the
chief
clerk
in
a
large
bank
.
''
This
reply
was
followed
by
*NL*
laughter
among
the
right
hand
faction
down
in
the
hall
,
it
was
so
hearty
*NL*
that
K.
could
n't
stop
himself
joining
in
with
it
.
The
people
supported
*NL*
themselves
with
their
hands
on
their
knees
and
shook
as
if
suffering
a
*NL*
serious
attack
of
coughing
.
Even
some
of
those
in
the
gallery
were
*NL*
laughing
.
The
judge
had
become
quite
cross
but
seemed
to
have
no
power
*NL*
over
those
below
him
in
the
hall
,
he
tried
to
reduce
what
harm
had
been
*NL*
done
in
the
gallery
and
jumped
up
threatening
them
,
his
eyebrows
,
until
*NL*
then
hardly
remarkable
,
pushed
themselves
up
and
became
big
,
black
and
*NL*
bushy
over
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
left
hand
side
of
the
hall
was
still
quiet
,
though
,
the
people
*NL*
stood
there
in
rows
with
their
faces
looking
towards
the
podium
*NL*
listening
to
what
was
being
said
there
,
they
observed
the
noise
from
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
hall
with
the
same
quietness
and
even
allowed
some
*NL*
individuals
from
their
own
ranks
,
here
and
there
,
to
go
forward
into
the
*NL*
other
faction
.
The
people
in
the
left
faction
were
not
only
fewer
in
*NL*
number
than
the
right
but
probably
were
no
more
important
than
them
,
*NL*
although
their
behaviour
was
calmer
and
that
made
it
seem
like
they
*NL*
were
.
When
K.
now
began
to
speak
he
was
convinced
he
was
doing
it
in
*NL*
the
same
way
as
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
question
,
My
Lord
,
as
to
whether
I
am
a
house
painter
-
in
*NL*
fact
even
more
than
that
,
you
did
not
ask
at
all
but
merely
imposed
it
*NL*
on
me
-
is
symptomatic
of
the
whole
way
these
proceedings
against
me
are
*NL*
being
carried
out
.
Perhaps
you
will
object
that
there
are
no
*NL*
proceedings
against
me
.
You
will
be
quite
right
,
as
there
are
*NL*
proceedings
only
if
I
acknowledge
that
there
are
.
But
,
for
the
moment
,
*NL*
I
do
acknowledge
it
,
out
of
pity
for
yourselves
to
a
large
extent
.
It
's
*NL*
impossible
not
to
observe
all
this
business
without
feeling
pity
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
say
things
are
being
done
without
due
care
but
I
would
like
to
*NL*
make
it
clear
that
it
is
I
who
make
the
acknowledgement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
K.
stopped
speaking
and
looked
down
into
the
hall
.
He
had
spoken
*NL*
sharply
,
more
sharply
than
he
had
intended
,
but
he
had
been
quite
right
.
*NL*
It
should
have
been
rewarded
with
some
applause
here
and
there
but
*NL*
everything
was
quiet
,
they
were
all
clearly
waiting
for
what
would
*NL*
follow
,
perhaps
the
quietness
was
laying
the
ground
for
an
outbreak
of
*NL*
activity
that
would
bring
this
whole
affair
to
an
end
.
It
was
somewhat
*NL*
disturbing
that
just
then
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
opened
,
the
*NL*
young
washerwoman
,
who
seemed
to
have
finished
her
work
,
came
in
and
,
*NL*
despite
all
her
caution
,
attracted
the
attention
of
some
of
the
people
*NL*
there
.
It
was
only
the
judge
who
gave
K.
any
direct
pleasure
,
as
he
*NL*
seemed
to
have
been
immediately
struck
by
K.
's
words
.
Until
then
,
he
*NL*
had
listened
to
him
standing
,
as
K.
's
speech
had
taken
him
by
surprise
*NL*
while
he
was
directing
his
attention
to
the
gallery
.
Now
,
in
the
pause
,
*NL*
he
sat
down
very
slowly
,
as
if
he
did
not
want
anyone
to
notice
.
He
*NL*
took
out
the
notebook
again
,
probably
so
that
he
could
give
the
*NL*
impression
of
being
calmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wo
n't
help
you
,
sir
,
''
continued
K.
,
``
even
your
little
book
*NL*
will
only
confirm
what
I
say
.
''
K.
was
satisfied
to
hear
nothing
but
his
*NL*
own
quiet
words
in
this
room
full
of
strangers
,
and
he
even
dared
*NL*
casually
to
pick
up
the
examining
judge
's
notebook
and
,
touching
it
only
*NL*
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
as
if
it
were
something
revolting
,
lifted
*NL*
it
in
the
air
,
holding
it
just
by
one
of
the
middle
pages
so
that
the
*NL*
others
on
each
side
of
it
,
closely
written
,
blotted
and
yellowing
,
*NL*
flapped
down
.
``
Those
are
the
official
notes
of
the
examining
judge
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
and
let
the
notebook
fall
down
onto
the
desk
.
``
You
can
read
in
*NL*
your
book
as
much
as
you
like
,
sir
,
I
really
do
n't
have
anything
in
this
*NL*
charge
book
to
be
afraid
of
,
even
though
I
do
n't
have
access
to
it
as
I
*NL*
would
n't
want
it
in
my
hand
,
I
can
only
touch
it
with
two
fingers
.
''
The
*NL*
judge
grabbed
the
notebook
from
where
it
had
fallen
on
the
desk
-
which
*NL*
could
only
have
been
a
sign
of
his
deep
humiliation
,
or
at
least
that
is
*NL*
how
it
must
have
been
perceived
-
tried
to
tidy
it
up
a
little
,
and
held
*NL*
it
once
more
in
front
of
himself
in
order
to
read
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
in
the
front
row
looked
up
at
him
,
showing
such
tension
*NL*
on
their
faces
that
he
looked
back
down
at
them
for
some
time
.
Every
*NL*
one
of
them
was
an
old
man
,
some
of
them
with
white
beards
.
Could
they
*NL*
perhaps
be
the
crucial
group
who
could
turn
the
whole
assembly
one
way
*NL*
or
the
other
?
They
had
sunk
into
a
state
of
motionlessness
while
K.
*NL*
gave
his
oration
,
and
it
had
not
been
possible
to
raise
them
from
this
*NL*
passivity
even
when
the
judge
was
being
humiliated
.
``
What
has
happened
*NL*
to
me
,
''
continued
K.
,
with
less
of
the
vigour
he
had
had
earlier
,
he
*NL*
continually
scanned
the
faces
in
the
first
row
,
and
this
gave
his
*NL*
address
a
somewhat
nervous
and
distracted
character
,
``
what
has
happened
*NL*
to
me
is
not
just
an
isolated
case
.
If
it
were
it
would
not
be
of
much
*NL*
importance
as
it
's
not
of
much
importance
to
me
,
but
it
is
a
symptom
of
*NL*
proceedings
which
are
carried
out
against
many
.
It
's
on
behalf
of
them
*NL*
that
I
stand
here
now
,
not
for
myself
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Without
having
intended
it
,
he
had
raised
his
voice
.
Somewhere
in
*NL*
the
hall
,
someone
raised
his
hands
and
applauded
him
shouting
,
``
Bravo
!
*NL*
Why
not
then
?
Bravo
!
Again
I
say
,
Bravo
!
''
Some
of
the
men
in
the
*NL*
first
row
groped
around
in
their
beards
,
none
of
them
looked
round
to
*NL*
see
who
was
shouting
.
Not
even
K.
thought
him
of
any
importance
but
it
*NL*
did
raise
his
spirits
;
he
no
longer
thought
it
at
all
necessary
that
all
*NL*
of
those
in
the
hall
should
applaud
him
,
it
was
enough
if
the
majority
*NL*
of
them
began
to
think
about
the
matter
and
if
only
one
of
them
,
now
*NL*
and
then
,
was
persuaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
trying
to
be
a
successful
orator
,
''
said
K.
after
this
*NL*
thought
,
``
that
's
probably
more
than
I
'm
capable
of
anyway
.
I
'm
sure
the
*NL*
examining
judge
can
speak
far
better
than
I
can
,
it
is
part
of
his
job
*NL*
after
all
.
All
that
I
want
is
a
public
discussion
of
a
public
wrong
.
*NL*
Listen
:
ten
days
ago
I
was
placed
under
arrest
,
the
arrest
itself
is
*NL*
something
I
laugh
about
but
that
's
beside
the
point
.
They
came
for
me
*NL*
in
the
morning
when
I
was
still
in
bed
.
Maybe
the
order
had
been
given
*NL*
to
arrest
some
house
painter
-
that
seems
possible
after
what
the
judge
*NL*
has
said
-
someone
who
is
as
innocent
as
I
am
,
but
it
was
me
they
chose
.
*NL*
There
were
two
police
thugs
occupying
the
next
room
.
They
could
not
*NL*
have
taken
better
precautions
if
I
had
been
a
dangerous
robber
.
And
*NL*
these
policemen
were
unprincipled
riff-raff
,
they
talked
at
me
till
I
*NL*
was
sick
of
it
,
they
wanted
bribes
,
they
wanted
to
trick
me
into
giving
*NL*
them
my
clothes
,
they
wanted
money
,
supposedly
so
that
they
could
bring
*NL*
me
my
breakfast
after
they
had
blatantly
eaten
my
own
breakfast
in
front
*NL*
of
my
eyes
.
And
even
that
was
not
enough
.
I
was
led
in
front
of
the
*NL*
supervisor
in
another
room
.
This
was
the
room
of
a
lady
who
I
have
a
*NL*
lot
of
respect
for
,
and
I
was
forced
to
look
on
while
the
supervisor
and
*NL*
the
policemen
made
quite
a
mess
of
this
room
because
of
me
,
although
not
*NL*
through
any
fault
of
mine
.
It
was
not
easy
to
stay
calm
,
but
I
managed
*NL*
to
do
so
and
was
completely
calm
when
I
asked
the
supervisor
why
it
was
*NL*
that
I
was
under
arrest
.
If
he
were
here
he
would
have
to
confirm
what
*NL*
I
say
.
I
can
see
him
now
,
sitting
on
the
chair
belonging
to
that
lady
I
*NL*
mentioned
-
a
picture
of
dull-witted
arrogance
.
What
do
you
think
he
*NL*
answered
?
What
he
told
me
,
gentlemen
,
was
basically
nothing
at
all
;
*NL*
perhaps
he
really
did
know
nothing
,
he
had
placed
me
under
arrest
and
*NL*
was
satisfied
.
In
fact
he
had
done
more
than
that
and
brought
three
*NL*
junior
employees
from
the
bank
where
I
work
into
the
lady
's
room
;
they
*NL*
had
made
themselves
busy
interfering
with
some
photographs
that
belonged
*NL*
to
the
lady
and
causing
a
mess
.
There
was
,
of
course
,
another
reason
*NL*
for
bringing
these
employees
;
they
,
just
like
my
landlady
and
her
maid
,
*NL*
were
expected
to
spread
the
news
of
my
arrest
and
damage
my
public
*NL*
reputation
and
in
particular
to
remove
me
from
my
position
at
the
bank
.
*NL*
Well
they
did
n't
succeed
in
any
of
that
,
not
in
the
slightest
,
even
my
*NL*
landlady
,
who
is
quite
a
simple
person
-
and
I
will
give
you
here
her
*NL*
name
in
full
respect
,
her
name
is
Mrs.
Grubach
-
even
Mrs.
Grubach
was
*NL*
understanding
enough
to
see
that
an
arrest
like
this
has
no
more
*NL*
significance
than
an
attack
carried
out
on
the
street
by
some
youths
who
*NL*
are
not
kept
under
proper
control
.
I
repeat
,
this
whole
affair
has
*NL*
caused
me
nothing
but
unpleasantness
and
temporary
irritation
,
but
could
*NL*
it
not
also
have
had
some
far
worse
consequences
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
K.
broke
off
here
and
looked
at
the
judge
,
who
said
nothing
.
As
*NL*
he
did
so
he
thought
he
saw
the
judge
use
a
movement
of
his
eyes
to
give
*NL*
a
sign
to
someone
in
the
crowd
.
K.
smiled
and
said
,
``
And
now
the
judge
,
*NL*
right
next
to
me
,
is
giving
a
secret
sign
to
someone
among
you
.
There
*NL*
seems
to
be
someone
among
you
who
is
taking
directions
from
above
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
whether
the
sign
is
meant
to
produce
booing
or
applause
,
but
*NL*
I
'll
resist
trying
to
guess
what
its
meaning
is
too
soon
.
It
really
*NL*
does
n't
matter
to
me
,
and
I
give
his
lordship
the
judge
my
full
and
*NL*
public
permission
to
stop
giving
secret
signs
to
his
paid
subordinate
*NL*
down
there
and
give
his
orders
in
words
instead
;
let
him
just
say
``
Boo
*NL*
now
!
,
''
and
then
the
next
time
``
Clap
now
!
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
embarrassment
or
impatience
,
the
judge
rocked
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
on
his
seat
.
The
man
behind
him
,
whom
he
had
*NL*
been
talking
with
earlier
,
leant
forward
again
,
either
to
give
him
a
few
*NL*
general
words
of
encouragement
or
some
specific
piece
of
advice
.
Below
*NL*
them
in
the
hall
the
people
talked
to
each
other
quietly
but
animatedly
.
*NL*
The
two
factions
had
earlier
seemed
to
hold
views
strongly
opposed
to
*NL*
each
other
but
now
they
began
to
intermingle
,
a
few
individuals
pointed
*NL*
up
at
K.
,
others
pointed
at
the
judge
.
The
air
in
the
room
was
fuggy
*NL*
and
extremely
oppressive
,
those
who
were
standing
furthest
away
could
*NL*
hardly
even
be
seen
through
it
.
It
must
have
been
especially
*NL*
troublesome
for
those
visitors
who
were
in
the
gallery
,
as
they
were
*NL*
forced
to
quietly
ask
the
participants
in
the
assembly
what
exactly
was
*NL*
happening
,
albeit
with
timid
glances
at
the
judge
.
The
replies
they
*NL*
received
were
just
as
quiet
,
and
given
behind
the
protection
of
a
raised
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nearly
finished
what
I
have
to
say
,
''
said
K.
,
and
as
there
*NL*
was
no
bell
available
he
struck
the
desk
with
his
fist
in
a
way
that
*NL*
startled
the
judge
and
his
advisor
and
made
them
look
up
from
each
*NL*
other
.
``
None
of
this
concerns
me
,
and
I
am
therefore
able
to
make
a
calm
*NL*
assessment
of
it
,
and
,
assuming
that
this
so-called
court
is
of
any
real
*NL*
importance
,
it
will
be
very
much
to
your
advantage
to
listen
to
what
I
*NL*
have
to
say
.
If
you
want
to
discuss
what
I
say
,
please
do
n't
bother
to
*NL*
write
it
down
until
later
on
,
I
do
n't
have
any
time
to
waste
and
I
'll
*NL*
soon
be
leaving
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
immediate
silence
,
which
showed
how
well
K.
was
in
*NL*
control
of
the
crowd
.
There
were
no
shouts
among
them
as
there
had
been
*NL*
at
the
start
,
no-one
even
applauded
,
but
if
they
were
n't
already
*NL*
persuaded
they
seemed
very
close
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
K
was
pleased
at
the
tension
among
all
the
people
there
as
they
*NL*
listened
to
him
,
a
rustling
rose
from
the
silence
which
was
more
*NL*
invigorating
than
the
most
ecstatic
applause
could
have
been
.
``
There
is
*NL*
no
doubt
,
''
he
said
quietly
,
``
that
there
is
some
enormous
organisation
*NL*
determining
what
is
said
by
this
court
.
In
my
case
this
includes
my
*NL*
arrest
and
the
examination
taking
place
here
today
,
an
organisation
that
*NL*
employs
policemen
who
can
be
bribed
,
oafish
supervisors
and
judges
of
*NL*
whom
nothing
better
can
be
said
than
that
they
are
not
as
arrogant
as
*NL*
some
others
.
This
organisation
even
maintains
a
high-level
judiciary
*NL*
along
with
its
train
of
countless
servants
,
scribes
,
policemen
and
all
*NL*
the
other
assistance
that
it
needs
,
perhaps
even
executioners
and
*NL*
torturers
-
I
'm
not
afraid
of
using
those
words
.
And
what
,
gentlemen
,
is
*NL*
the
purpose
of
this
enormous
organisation
?
Its
purpose
is
to
arrest
*NL*
innocent
people
and
wage
pointless
prosecutions
against
them
which
,
as
*NL*
in
my
case
,
lead
to
no
result
.
How
are
we
to
avoid
those
in
office
*NL*
becoming
deeply
corrupt
when
everything
is
devoid
of
meaning
?
That
is
*NL*
impossible
,
not
even
the
highest
judge
would
be
able
to
achieve
that
for
*NL*
himself
.
That
is
why
policemen
try
to
steal
the
clothes
off
the
back
of
*NL*
those
they
arrest
,
that
is
why
supervisors
break
into
the
homes
of
*NL*
people
they
do
not
know
,
that
is
why
innocent
people
are
humiliated
in
*NL*
front
of
crowds
rather
than
being
given
a
proper
trial
.
The
policemen
*NL*
only
talked
about
the
warehouses
where
they
put
the
property
of
those
*NL*
they
arrest
,
I
would
like
to
see
these
warehouses
where
the
hard
won
*NL*
possessions
of
people
under
arrest
is
left
to
decay
,
if
,
that
is
,
it
's
*NL*
not
stolen
by
the
thieving
hands
of
the
warehouse
workers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
K.
was
interrupted
by
a
screeching
from
the
far
end
of
the
hall
,
*NL*
he
shaded
his
eyes
to
see
that
far
,
as
the
dull
light
of
day
made
the
*NL*
smoke
whitish
and
hard
to
see
through
.
It
was
the
washerwoman
whom
K.
*NL*
had
recognised
as
a
likely
source
of
disturbance
as
soon
as
she
had
*NL*
entered
.
It
was
hard
to
see
now
whether
it
was
her
fault
or
not
.
K.
*NL*
could
only
see
that
a
man
had
pulled
her
into
a
corner
by
the
door
and
*NL*
was
pressing
himself
against
her
.
But
it
was
not
her
who
was
screaming
,
*NL*
but
the
man
,
he
had
opened
his
mouth
wide
and
looked
up
at
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
A
small
circle
had
formed
around
the
two
of
them
,
the
visitors
near
him
*NL*
in
the
gallery
seemed
delighted
that
the
serious
tone
K.
had
introduced
*NL*
into
the
gathering
had
been
disturbed
in
this
way
.
K.
's
first
thought
*NL*
was
to
run
over
there
,
and
he
also
thought
that
everyone
would
want
to
*NL*
bring
things
back
into
order
there
or
at
least
to
make
the
pair
leave
*NL*
the
room
,
but
the
first
row
of
people
in
front
of
him
stayed
were
they
*NL*
were
,
no-one
moved
and
no-one
let
K.
through
.
On
the
contrary
,
they
*NL*
stood
in
his
way
,
old
men
held
out
their
arms
in
front
of
him
and
a
hand
*NL*
from
somewhere
-
he
did
not
have
the
time
to
turn
round
-
took
hold
of
*NL*
his
collar
.
K.
,
by
this
time
,
had
forgotten
about
the
pair
,
it
seemed
*NL*
to
him
that
his
freedom
was
being
limited
as
if
his
arrest
was
being
*NL*
taken
seriously
,
and
,
without
any
thought
for
what
he
was
doing
,
he
*NL*
jumped
down
from
the
podium
.
Now
he
stood
face
to
face
with
the
crowd
.
*NL*
Had
he
judged
the
people
properly
?
Had
he
put
too
much
faith
in
the
*NL*
effect
of
his
speech
?
Had
they
been
putting
up
a
pretence
all
the
time
*NL*
he
had
been
speaking
,
and
now
that
he
come
to
the
end
and
to
what
must
*NL*
follow
,
were
they
tired
of
pretending
?
What
faces
they
were
,
all
around
*NL*
him
!
Dark
,
little
eyes
flickered
here
and
there
,
cheeks
drooped
down
*NL*
like
on
drunken
men
,
their
long
beards
were
thin
and
stiff
,
if
they
took
*NL*
hold
of
them
it
was
more
like
they
were
making
their
hands
into
claws
,
*NL*
not
as
if
they
were
taking
hold
of
their
own
beards
.
But
underneath
*NL*
those
beards
-
and
this
was
the
real
discovery
made
by
K.
-
there
were
*NL*
badges
of
various
sizes
and
colours
shining
on
the
collars
of
their
*NL*
coats
.
As
far
as
he
could
see
,
every
one
of
them
was
wearing
one
of
*NL*
these
badges
.
All
of
them
belonged
to
the
same
group
,
even
though
they
*NL*
seemed
to
be
divided
to
the
right
and
the
left
of
him
,
and
when
he
*NL*
suddenly
turned
round
he
saw
the
same
badge
on
the
collar
of
the
*NL*
examining
judge
who
calmly
looked
down
at
him
with
his
hands
in
his
lap
.
*NL*
``
So
,
''
called
out
K
,
throwing
his
arms
in
the
air
as
if
this
sudden
*NL*
realisation
needed
more
room
,
``
all
of
you
are
working
for
this
*NL*
organisation
,
I
see
now
that
you
are
all
the
very
bunch
of
cheats
and
*NL*
liars
I
've
just
been
speaking
about
,
you
've
all
pressed
yourselves
in
*NL*
here
in
order
to
listen
in
and
snoop
on
me
,
you
gave
the
impression
of
*NL*
having
formed
into
factions
,
one
of
you
even
applauded
me
to
test
me
*NL*
out
,
and
you
wanted
to
learn
how
to
trap
an
innocent
man
!
Well
,
I
hope
*NL*
you
have
n't
come
here
for
nothing
,
I
hope
you
've
either
had
some
fun
*NL*
from
someone
who
expected
you
to
defend
his
innocence
or
else
-
let
go
*NL*
of
me
or
I
'll
hit
you
,
''
shouted
K.
to
a
quivery
old
man
who
had
pressed
*NL*
himself
especially
close
to
him
-
``
or
else
that
you
've
actually
learned
*NL*
something
.
And
so
I
wish
you
good
luck
in
your
trade
.
''
He
briskly
took
*NL*
his
hat
from
where
it
lay
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
,
surrounded
by
a
*NL*
silence
caused
perhaps
by
the
completeness
of
their
surprise
,
pushed
his
*NL*
way
to
the
exit
.
However
,
the
examining
judge
seems
to
have
moved
even
*NL*
more
quickly
than
K.
,
as
he
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
doorway
.
``
One
*NL*
moment
,
''
he
said
.
K.
stood
where
he
was
,
but
looked
at
the
door
with
*NL*
his
hand
already
on
its
handle
rather
than
at
the
judge
.
``
I
merely
*NL*
wanted
to
draw
your
attention
,
''
said
the
judge
,
``
to
something
you
seem
*NL*
not
yet
to
be
aware
of
:
today
,
you
have
robbed
yourself
of
the
*NL*
advantages
that
a
hearing
of
this
sort
always
gives
to
someone
who
is
*NL*
under
arrest
.
''
K.
laughed
towards
the
door
.
``
You
bunch
of
louts
,
''
he
*NL*
called
,
``
you
can
keep
all
your
hearings
as
a
present
from
me
,
''
then
*NL*
opened
the
door
and
hurried
down
the
steps
.
Behind
him
,
the
noise
of
*NL*
the
assembly
rose
as
it
became
lively
once
more
and
probably
began
to
*NL*
discuss
these
events
as
if
making
a
scientific
study
of
them
.

Chapter
Three
*NL*
In
the
empty
Courtroom
-
The
Student
-
The
Offices
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
over
the
following
week
,
K.
expected
another
summons
to
*NL*
arrive
,
he
could
not
believe
that
his
rejection
of
any
more
hearings
had
*NL*
been
taken
literally
,
and
when
the
expected
summons
really
had
not
come
*NL*
by
Saturday
evening
he
took
it
to
mean
that
he
was
expected
,
without
*NL*
being
told
,
to
appear
at
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
.
So
on
Sunday
,
*NL*
he
set
out
once
more
in
the
same
direction
,
going
without
hesitation
up
*NL*
the
steps
and
through
the
corridors
;
some
of
the
people
remembered
him
*NL*
and
greeted
him
from
their
doorways
,
but
he
no
longer
needed
to
ask
*NL*
anyone
the
way
and
soon
arrived
at
the
right
door
.
It
was
opened
as
*NL*
soon
as
he
knocked
and
,
paying
no
attention
to
the
woman
he
had
seen
*NL*
last
time
who
was
standing
at
the
doorway
,
he
was
about
to
go
straight
*NL*
into
the
adjoining
room
when
she
said
to
him
``
There
's
no
session
today
''
.
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
;
no
session
?
''
he
asked
,
unable
to
believe
it
.
But
the
*NL*
woman
persuaded
him
by
opening
the
door
to
the
next
room
.
It
was
indeed
*NL*
empty
,
and
looked
even
more
dismal
empty
than
it
had
the
previous
*NL*
Sunday
.
On
the
podium
stood
the
table
exactly
as
it
had
been
before
*NL*
with
a
few
books
laying
on
it
.
``
Can
I
have
a
look
at
those
books
?
''
*NL*
asked
K.
,
not
because
he
was
especially
curious
but
so
that
he
would
not
*NL*
have
come
for
nothing
.
``
No
,
''
said
the
woman
as
she
re-closed
the
door
,
*NL*
``
that
's
not
allowed
.
Those
books
belong
to
the
examining
judge
.
''
``
I
*NL*
see
,
''
said
K.
,
and
nodded
,
``
those
books
must
be
law
books
,
and
that
's
*NL*
how
this
court
does
things
,
not
only
to
try
people
who
are
innocent
but
*NL*
even
to
try
them
without
letting
them
know
what
's
going
on
.
''
``
I
expect
*NL*
you
're
right
,
''
said
the
woman
,
who
had
not
understood
exactly
what
he
*NL*
meant
.
``
I
'd
better
go
away
again
,
then
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
``
Should
I
give
a
message
to
the
examining
judge
?
''
asked
the
woman
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
know
him
,
then
?
''
asked
K.
``
Of
course
I
know
him
,
''
said
the
woman
,
*NL*
``
my
husband
is
the
court
usher
.
''
It
was
only
now
that
K.
noticed
that
*NL*
the
room
,
which
before
had
held
nothing
but
a
wash-tub
,
had
been
fitted
*NL*
out
as
a
living
room
.
The
woman
saw
how
surprised
he
was
and
said
,
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
're
allowed
to
live
here
as
we
like
,
only
we
have
to
clear
the
*NL*
room
out
when
the
court
's
in
session
.
There
's
lots
of
disadvantages
to
*NL*
my
husband
's
job
.
''
``
It
's
not
so
much
the
room
that
surprises
me
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
,
looking
at
her
crossly
,
``
it
's
your
being
married
that
shocks
me
.
''
*NL*
``
Are
you
thinking
about
what
happened
last
time
the
court
was
in
*NL*
session
,
when
I
disturbed
what
you
were
saying
?
''
asked
the
woman
.
``
Of
*NL*
course
,
''
said
K.
,
``
it
's
in
the
past
now
and
I
've
nearly
forgotten
about
*NL*
it
,
but
at
the
time
it
made
me
furious
.
And
now
you
tell
me
yourself
*NL*
that
you
are
a
married
woman
.
''
``
It
was
n't
any
disadvantage
for
you
to
*NL*
have
your
speech
interrupted
.
The
way
they
talked
about
you
after
you
'd
*NL*
gone
was
really
bad
.
''
``
That
could
well
be
,
''
said
K.
,
turning
away
,
``
but
*NL*
it
does
not
excuse
you
.
''
``
There
's
no-one
I
know
who
'd
hold
it
against
*NL*
me
,
''
said
the
woman
.
``
Him
,
who
put
his
arms
around
me
,
he
's
been
chasing
*NL*
after
me
for
a
long
time
.
I
might
not
be
very
attractive
for
most
*NL*
people
,
but
I
am
for
him
.
I
've
got
no
protection
from
him
,
even
my
*NL*
husband
has
had
to
get
used
to
it
;
if
he
wants
to
keep
his
job
he
's
got
*NL*
to
put
up
with
it
as
that
man
's
a
student
and
he
'll
almost
certainly
be
*NL*
very
powerful
later
on
.
He
's
always
after
me
,
he
'd
only
just
left
when
*NL*
you
arrived
.
''
``
That
fits
in
with
everything
else
,
''
said
K.
,
``
I
'm
not
*NL*
surprised
.
''
``
Do
you
want
to
make
things
a
bit
better
here
?
''
the
woman
*NL*
asked
slowly
,
watching
him
as
if
she
were
saying
something
that
could
be
*NL*
as
dangerous
for
K.
as
for
herself
.
``
That
's
what
I
thought
when
I
heard
*NL*
you
speak
,
I
really
liked
what
you
said
.
Mind
you
,
I
only
heard
part
of
*NL*
it
,
I
missed
the
beginning
of
it
and
at
the
end
I
was
lying
on
the
floor
*NL*
with
the
student
-
it
's
so
horrible
here
,
''
she
said
after
a
pause
,
and
*NL*
took
hold
of
K.
's
hand
.
``
Do
you
believe
you
really
will
be
able
to
make
*NL*
things
better
?
''
K.
smiled
and
twisted
his
hand
round
a
little
in
her
*NL*
soft
hands
.
``
It
's
really
not
my
job
to
make
things
better
here
,
as
you
*NL*
put
it
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
if
you
said
that
to
the
examining
judge
he
would
*NL*
laugh
at
you
or
punish
you
for
it
.
I
really
would
not
have
become
*NL*
involved
in
this
matter
if
I
could
have
helped
it
,
and
I
would
have
lost
*NL*
no
sleep
worrying
about
how
this
court
needs
to
be
made
better
.
But
*NL*
because
I
'm
told
that
I
have
been
arrested
-
and
I
am
under
arrest
-
it
*NL*
forces
me
to
take
some
action
,
and
to
do
so
for
my
own
sake
.
However
,
*NL*
if
I
can
be
of
some
service
to
you
in
the
process
I
will
,
of
course
,
be
*NL*
glad
to
do
so
.
And
I
will
be
glad
to
do
so
not
only
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
charity
but
also
because
you
can
be
of
some
help
to
me
.
''
``
How
could
I
*NL*
help
you
,
then
?
''
said
the
woman
.
``
You
could
,
for
example
,
show
me
the
*NL*
books
on
the
table
there
.
''
``
Yes
,
certainly
,
''
the
woman
cried
,
and
*NL*
pulled
K.
along
behind
her
as
she
rushed
to
them
.
The
books
were
old
*NL*
and
well
worn
,
the
cover
of
one
of
them
had
nearly
broken
through
in
its
*NL*
middle
,
and
it
was
held
together
with
a
few
threads
.
``
Everything
is
so
*NL*
dirty
here
,
''
said
K.
,
shaking
his
head
,
and
before
he
could
pick
the
*NL*
books
up
the
woman
wiped
some
of
the
dust
off
with
her
apron
.
K.
took
*NL*
hold
of
the
book
that
lay
on
top
and
threw
it
open
,
an
indecent
picture
*NL*
appeared
.
A
man
and
a
woman
sat
naked
on
a
sofa
,
the
base
intent
of
*NL*
whoever
drew
it
was
easy
to
see
but
he
had
been
so
grossly
lacking
in
*NL*
skill
that
all
that
anyone
could
really
make
out
were
the
man
and
the
*NL*
woman
who
dominated
the
picture
with
their
bodies
,
sitting
in
overly
*NL*
upright
postures
that
created
a
false
perspective
and
made
it
difficult
*NL*
for
them
to
approach
each
other
.
K.
did
n't
thumb
through
that
book
any
*NL*
more
,
but
just
threw
open
the
next
one
at
its
title
page
,
it
was
a
novel
*NL*
with
the
title
,
What
Grete
Suffered
from
her
Husband
,
Hans
.
``
So
this
is
*NL*
the
sort
of
law
book
they
study
here
,
''
said
K.
,
``
this
is
the
sort
of
*NL*
person
sitting
in
judgement
over
me
.
''
``
I
can
help
you
,
''
said
the
woman
,
*NL*
``
would
you
like
me
to
?
''
``
Could
you
really
do
that
without
placing
*NL*
yourself
in
danger
?
You
did
say
earlier
on
that
your
husband
is
wholly
*NL*
dependent
on
his
superiors
.
''
``
I
still
want
to
help
you
,
''
said
the
*NL*
woman
,
``
come
over
here
,
we
've
got
to
talk
about
it
.
Do
n't
say
any
more
*NL*
about
what
danger
I
'm
in
,
I
only
fear
danger
where
I
want
to
fear
it
.
*NL*
Come
over
here
.
''
She
pointed
to
the
podium
and
invited
him
to
sit
down
*NL*
on
the
step
with
her
.
``
You
've
got
lovely
dark
eyes
,
''
she
said
after
*NL*
they
had
sat
down
,
looking
up
into
K.
's
face
,
``
people
say
I
've
got
nice
*NL*
eyes
too
,
but
yours
are
much
nicer
.
It
was
the
first
thing
I
noticed
*NL*
when
you
first
came
here
.
That
's
even
why
I
came
in
here
,
into
the
*NL*
assembly
room
,
afterwards
,
I
'd
never
normally
do
that
,
I
'm
not
really
*NL*
even
allowed
to
.
''
So
that
's
what
all
this
is
about
,
thought
K.
,
she
's
*NL*
offering
herself
to
me
,
she
's
as
degenerate
as
everything
else
around
*NL*
here
,
she
's
had
enough
of
the
court
officials
,
which
is
understandable
I
*NL*
suppose
,
and
so
she
approaches
any
stranger
and
makes
compliments
about
*NL*
his
eyes
.
With
that
,
K.
stood
up
in
silence
as
if
he
had
spoken
his
*NL*
thoughts
out
loud
and
thus
explained
his
action
to
the
woman
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
you
can
be
of
any
assistance
to
me
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
be
of
any
real
*NL*
assistance
you
would
need
to
be
in
contact
with
high
officials
.
But
I
'm
*NL*
sure
you
only
know
the
lower
employees
,
and
there
are
crowds
of
them
*NL*
milling
about
here
.
I
'm
sure
you
're
very
familiar
with
them
and
could
*NL*
achieve
a
great
deal
through
them
,
I
've
no
doubt
of
that
,
but
the
most
*NL*
that
could
be
done
through
them
would
have
no
bearing
at
all
on
the
*NL*
final
outcome
of
the
trial
.
You
,
on
the
other
hand
,
would
lose
some
of
*NL*
your
friends
as
a
result
,
and
I
have
no
wish
of
that
.
Carry
on
with
*NL*
these
people
in
the
same
way
as
you
have
been
,
as
it
does
seem
to
me
to
*NL*
be
something
you
can
not
do
without
.
I
have
no
regrets
in
saying
this
*NL*
as
,
in
return
for
your
compliment
to
me
,
I
also
find
you
rather
*NL*
attractive
,
especially
when
you
look
at
me
as
sadly
as
you
are
now
,
*NL*
although
you
really
have
no
reason
to
do
so
.
You
belong
to
the
people
I
*NL*
have
to
combat
,
and
you
're
very
comfortable
among
them
,
you
're
even
in
*NL*
love
with
the
student
,
or
if
you
do
n't
love
him
you
do
at
least
prefer
*NL*
him
to
your
husband
.
It
's
easy
to
see
that
from
what
you
've
been
*NL*
saying
.
''
``
No
!
''
she
shouted
,
remained
sitting
where
she
was
and
grasped
*NL*
K.
's
hand
,
which
he
failed
to
pull
away
fast
enough
.
``
You
ca
n't
go
away
*NL*
now
,
you
ca
n't
go
away
when
you
've
misjudged
me
like
that
!
Are
you
*NL*
really
capable
of
going
away
now
?
Am
I
really
so
worthless
that
you
*NL*
wo
n't
even
do
me
the
favour
of
staying
a
little
bit
longer
?
''
``
You
*NL*
misunderstand
me
,
''
said
K.
,
sitting
back
down
,
``
if
it
's
really
important
*NL*
to
you
for
me
to
stay
here
then
I
'll
be
glad
to
do
so
,
I
have
plenty
of
*NL*
time
,
I
came
here
thinking
there
would
be
a
trial
taking
place
.
All
I
*NL*
meant
with
what
I
said
just
now
was
to
ask
you
not
to
do
anything
on
my
*NL*
behalf
in
the
proceedings
against
me
.
But
even
that
is
nothing
for
you
*NL*
to
worry
about
when
you
consider
that
there
's
nothing
hanging
on
the
*NL*
outcome
of
this
trial
,
and
that
,
whatever
the
verdict
,
I
will
just
laugh
*NL*
at
it
.
And
that
's
even
presupposing
it
ever
even
reaches
any
*NL*
conclusion
,
which
I
very
much
doubt
.
I
think
it
's
much
more
likely
that
*NL*
the
court
officials
will
be
too
lazy
,
too
forgetful
,
or
even
to
fearful
*NL*
ever
to
continue
with
these
proceedings
and
that
they
will
soon
be
*NL*
abandoned
if
they
have
n't
been
abandoned
already
.
It
's
even
possible
*NL*
that
they
will
pretend
to
be
carrying
on
with
the
trial
in
the
hope
of
*NL*
receiving
a
large
bribe
,
although
I
can
tell
you
now
that
that
will
be
*NL*
quite
in
vain
as
I
pay
bribes
to
no-one
.
Perhaps
one
favour
you
could
*NL*
do
me
would
be
to
tell
the
examining
judge
,
or
anyone
else
who
likes
to
*NL*
spread
important
news
,
that
I
will
never
be
induced
to
pay
any
sort
of
*NL*
bribe
through
any
stratagem
of
theirs
-
and
I
'm
sure
they
have
many
*NL*
stratagems
at
their
disposal
.
There
is
no
prospect
of
that
,
you
can
*NL*
tell
them
that
quite
openly
.
And
what
's
more
,
I
expect
they
have
*NL*
already
noticed
themselves
,
or
even
if
they
have
n't
,
this
affair
is
*NL*
really
not
so
important
to
me
as
they
think
.
Those
gentlemen
would
only
*NL*
save
some
work
for
themselves
,
or
at
least
some
unpleasantness
for
me
,
*NL*
which
,
however
,
I
am
glad
to
endure
if
I
know
that
each
piece
of
*NL*
unpleasantness
for
me
is
a
blow
against
them
.
And
I
will
make
quite
*NL*
sure
it
is
a
blow
against
them
.
Do
you
actually
know
the
judge
?
''
*NL*
``
Course
I
do
,
''
said
the
woman
,
``
he
was
the
first
one
I
thought
of
when
I
*NL*
offered
to
help
you
.
I
did
n't
know
he
's
only
a
minor
official
,
but
if
*NL*
you
say
so
it
must
be
true
.
Mind
you
,
I
still
think
the
report
he
gives
*NL*
to
his
superiors
must
have
some
influence
.
And
he
writes
so
many
*NL*
reports
.
You
say
these
officials
are
lazy
,
but
they
're
certainly
not
*NL*
all
lazy
,
especially
this
examining
judge
,
he
writes
ever
such
a
lot
.
*NL*
Last
Sunday
,
for
instance
,
that
session
went
on
till
the
evening
.
*NL*
Everyone
had
gone
,
but
the
examining
judge
,
he
stayed
in
the
hall
,
I
had
*NL*
to
bring
him
a
lamp
in
,
all
I
had
was
a
little
kitchen
lamp
but
he
was
*NL*
very
satisfied
with
it
and
started
to
write
straight
away
.
Meantime
my
*NL*
husband
arrived
,
he
always
has
the
day
off
on
Sundays
,
we
got
the
*NL*
furniture
back
in
and
got
our
room
sorted
out
and
then
a
few
of
the
*NL*
neighbours
came
,
we
sat
and
talked
for
a
bit
by
a
candle
,
in
short
,
we
*NL*
forgot
all
about
the
examining
judge
and
went
to
bed
.
All
of
a
sudden
*NL*
in
the
night
,
it
must
have
been
quite
late
in
the
night
,
I
wakes
up
,
*NL*
next
to
the
bed
,
there
's
the
examining
judge
shading
the
lamp
with
his
*NL*
hand
so
that
there
's
no
light
from
it
falls
on
my
husband
,
he
did
n't
*NL*
need
to
be
as
careful
as
that
,
the
way
my
husband
sleeps
the
light
*NL*
would
n't
have
woken
him
up
anyway
.
I
was
quite
shocked
and
nearly
*NL*
screamed
,
but
the
judge
was
very
friendly
,
warned
me
I
should
be
*NL*
careful
,
he
whispered
to
me
he
's
been
writing
all
this
time
,
and
now
*NL*
he
's
brought
me
the
lamp
back
,
and
he
'll
never
forget
how
I
looked
when
*NL*
he
found
me
there
asleep
.
What
I
mean
,
with
all
this
,
I
just
wanted
to
*NL*
tell
you
how
the
examining
judge
really
does
write
lots
of
reports
,
*NL*
especially
about
you
as
questioning
you
was
definitely
one
of
the
main
*NL*
things
on
the
agenda
that
Sunday
.
If
he
writes
reports
as
long
as
that
*NL*
they
must
be
of
some
importance
.
And
besides
all
that
,
you
can
see
*NL*
from
what
happened
that
the
examining
judge
is
after
me
,
and
it
's
right
*NL*
now
,
when
he
's
first
begun
to
notice
me
,
that
I
can
have
a
lot
of
*NL*
influence
on
him
.
And
I
've
got
other
proof
I
mean
a
lot
to
him
,
too
.
*NL*
Yesterday
,
he
sent
that
student
to
me
,
the
one
he
really
trusts
and
who
*NL*
he
works
with
,
he
sent
him
with
a
present
for
me
,
silk
stockings
.
He
*NL*
said
it
was
because
I
clear
up
in
the
courtroom
but
that
's
only
a
*NL*
pretence
,
that
job
's
no
more
than
what
I
'm
supposed
to
do
,
it
's
what
my
*NL*
husband
gets
paid
for
.
Nice
stockings
,
they
are
,
look
,
''
-
she
stretched
*NL*
out
her
leg
,
drew
her
skirt
up
to
her
knee
and
looked
,
herself
,
at
the
*NL*
stocking
-
``
they
are
nice
stockings
,
but
they
're
too
good
for
me
,
*NL*
really
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
suddenly
interrupted
herself
and
lay
her
hand
on
K.
's
as
if
*NL*
she
wanted
to
calm
him
down
,
and
whispered
,
``
Be
quiet
,
Berthold
is
*NL*
watching
us
.
''
K.
slowly
looked
up
.
In
the
doorway
to
the
courtroom
*NL*
stood
a
young
man
,
he
was
short
,
his
legs
were
not
quite
straight
,
and
*NL*
he
continually
moved
his
finger
round
in
a
short
,
thin
,
red
beard
with
*NL*
which
he
hoped
to
make
himself
look
dignified
.
K.
looked
at
him
with
*NL*
some
curiosity
,
he
was
the
first
student
he
had
ever
met
of
the
*NL*
unfamiliar
discipline
of
jurisprudence
,
face
to
face
at
least
,
a
man
who
*NL*
would
even
most
likely
attain
high
office
one
day
.
The
student
,
in
*NL*
contrast
,
seemed
to
take
no
notice
of
K.
at
all
,
he
merely
withdrew
his
*NL*
finger
from
his
beard
long
enough
to
beckon
to
the
woman
and
went
over
*NL*
to
the
window
,
the
woman
leant
over
to
K.
and
whispered
,
``
Do
n't
be
cross
*NL*
with
me
,
please
do
n't
,
and
please
do
n't
think
ill
of
me
either
,
I
've
got
*NL*
to
go
to
him
now
,
to
this
horrible
man
,
just
look
at
his
bent
legs
.
But
*NL*
I
'll
come
straight
back
and
then
I
'll
go
with
you
if
you
'll
take
me
,
*NL*
I
'll
go
wherever
you
want
,
you
can
do
whatever
you
like
with
me
,
I
'll
be
*NL*
happy
if
I
can
be
away
from
here
for
as
long
as
possible
,
it
'd
be
best
*NL*
if
I
could
get
away
from
here
for
good
.
''
She
stroked
K.
's
hand
once
*NL*
more
,
jumped
up
and
ran
over
to
the
window
.
Before
he
realised
it
,
K.
*NL*
grasped
for
her
hand
but
failed
to
catch
it
.
He
really
was
attracted
*NL*
to
the
woman
,
and
even
after
thinking
hard
about
it
could
find
no
good
*NL*
reason
why
he
should
not
give
in
to
her
allure
.
It
briefly
crossed
his
*NL*
mind
that
the
woman
meant
to
entrap
him
on
behalf
of
the
court
,
but
that
*NL*
was
an
objection
he
had
no
difficulty
in
fending
off
.
In
what
way
could
*NL*
she
entrap
him
?
Was
he
not
still
free
,
so
free
that
he
could
crush
the
*NL*
entire
court
whenever
he
wanted
,
as
least
where
it
concerned
him
?
Could
*NL*
he
not
have
that
much
confidence
in
himself
?
And
her
offer
of
help
*NL*
sounded
sincere
,
and
maybe
it
was
n't
quite
worthless
.
And
maybe
there
*NL*
was
no
better
revenge
against
the
examining
judge
and
his
cronies
than
*NL*
to
take
this
woman
from
him
and
have
her
for
himself
.
Maybe
then
,
after
*NL*
much
hard
work
writing
dishonest
reports
about
K.
,
the
judge
would
go
to
*NL*
the
woman
's
bed
late
one
night
and
find
it
empty
.
And
it
would
be
empty
*NL*
because
she
belonged
to
K.
,
because
this
woman
at
the
window
,
this
lush
,
*NL*
supple
,
warm
body
in
its
sombre
clothes
of
rough
,
heavy
material
*NL*
belonged
to
him
,
totally
to
him
and
to
him
alone
.
Once
he
had
settled
*NL*
his
thoughts
towards
the
woman
in
this
way
,
he
began
to
find
the
quiet
*NL*
conversation
at
the
window
was
taking
too
long
,
he
rapped
on
the
podium
*NL*
with
his
knuckles
,
and
then
even
with
his
fist
.
The
student
briefly
*NL*
looked
away
from
the
woman
to
glance
at
K.
over
his
shoulder
but
did
*NL*
allow
himself
to
be
disturbed
,
in
fact
he
even
pressed
himself
close
to
*NL*
the
woman
and
put
his
arms
around
her
.
She
dropped
her
head
down
low
as
*NL*
if
listening
to
him
carefully
,
as
she
did
so
he
kissed
her
right
on
the
*NL*
neck
,
hardly
even
interrupting
what
he
was
saying
.
K.
saw
this
as
*NL*
confirmation
of
the
tyranny
the
student
held
over
the
woman
and
which
*NL*
she
had
already
complained
about
,
he
stood
up
and
walked
up
and
down
the
*NL*
room
.
Glancing
sideways
at
the
student
,
he
wondered
what
would
be
the
*NL*
quickest
possible
way
to
get
rid
of
him
,
and
so
it
was
not
unwelcome
to
*NL*
him
when
the
student
,
clearly
disturbed
by
K.
's
to-ing
and
fro-ing
which
*NL*
K.
had
now
developed
into
a
stamping
up
and
down
,
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
have
to
stay
here
,
you
know
,
if
you
're
getting
impatient
.
*NL*
You
could
have
gone
earlier
,
no-one
would
have
missed
you
.
In
fact
you
*NL*
should
have
gone
,
you
should
have
left
as
quickly
as
possible
as
soon
as
*NL*
I
got
here
.
''
This
comment
could
have
caused
all
possible
rage
to
break
*NL*
out
between
them
,
but
K.
also
bore
in
mind
that
this
was
a
prospective
*NL*
court
official
speaking
to
a
disfavoured
defendant
,
and
he
might
well
*NL*
have
been
taking
pride
in
speaking
in
this
way
.
K.
remained
standing
*NL*
quite
close
to
him
and
said
with
a
smile
,
``
You
're
quite
right
,
I
am
*NL*
impatient
,
but
the
easiest
way
to
settle
this
impatience
would
be
if
you
*NL*
left
us
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
you
've
come
here
to
study
-
you
are
a
*NL*
student
,
I
hear
-
I
'll
be
quite
happy
to
leave
the
room
to
you
and
go
*NL*
away
with
the
woman
.
I
'm
sure
you
'll
still
have
a
lot
of
study
to
do
*NL*
before
you
're
made
into
a
judge
.
It
's
true
that
I
'm
still
not
all
that
*NL*
familiar
with
your
branch
of
jurisprudence
but
I
take
it
it
involves
a
*NL*
lot
more
than
speaking
roughly
-
and
I
see
you
have
no
shame
in
doing
*NL*
that
extremely
well
.
''
``
He
should
n't
have
been
allowed
to
move
about
so
*NL*
freely
,
''
said
the
student
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
give
the
woman
an
*NL*
explanation
for
K.
's
insults
,
``
that
was
a
mistake
.
I
've
told
the
*NL*
examining
judge
so
.
He
should
at
least
have
been
detained
in
his
room
*NL*
between
hearings
.
Sometimes
it
's
impossible
to
understand
what
the
*NL*
judge
thinks
he
's
doing
.
''
*NL*
``
You
're
wasting
your
breath
,
''
said
K.
,
then
he
reached
his
hand
out
*NL*
towards
the
woman
and
said
,
``
come
with
me
.
''
``
So
that
's
it
,
''
said
the
*NL*
student
,
``
oh
no
,
you
're
not
going
to
get
her
,
''
and
with
a
strength
you
*NL*
would
not
have
expected
from
him
,
he
glanced
tenderly
at
her
,
lifted
her
*NL*
up
on
one
arm
and
,
his
back
bent
under
the
weight
,
ran
with
her
to
the
*NL*
door
.
In
this
way
he
showed
,
unmistakeably
,
that
he
was
to
some
extent
*NL*
afraid
of
K.
,
but
he
nonetheless
dared
to
provoke
him
still
further
by
*NL*
stroking
and
squeezing
the
woman
's
arm
with
his
free
hand
.
K.
ran
the
*NL*
few
steps
up
to
him
,
but
when
he
had
reached
him
and
was
about
to
take
*NL*
hold
of
him
and
,
if
necessary
,
throttle
him
,
the
woman
said
,
``
It
's
no
*NL*
good
,
it
's
the
examining
judge
who
's
sent
for
me
,
I
dare
n't
go
with
you
,
*NL*
this
little
bastard
...
''
and
here
she
ran
her
hand
over
the
student
's
*NL*
face
,
``
this
little
bastard
wo
n't
let
me
.
''
``
And
you
do
n't
want
to
be
set
*NL*
free
!
''
shouted
K.
,
laying
his
hand
on
the
student
's
shoulder
,
who
then
*NL*
snapped
at
it
with
his
teeth
.
``
No
!
''
shouted
the
woman
,
pushing
K.
away
*NL*
with
both
hands
,
``
no
,
no
do
n't
do
that
,
what
d'you
think
you
're
doing
!?
*NL*
That
'd
be
the
end
of
me
.
Let
go
of
him
,
please
just
let
go
of
him
.
*NL*
He
's
only
carrying
out
the
judge
's
orders
,
he
's
carrying
me
to
him
.
''
*NL*
``
Let
him
take
you
then
,
and
I
want
to
see
nothing
more
of
you
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
enraged
by
his
disappointment
and
giving
the
student
a
thump
in
the
back
*NL*
so
that
he
briefly
stumbled
and
then
,
glad
that
he
had
not
fallen
,
*NL*
immediately
jumped
up
all
the
higher
with
his
burden
.
K.
followed
them
*NL*
slowly
.
He
realised
that
this
was
the
first
unambiguous
setback
he
had
*NL*
suffered
from
these
people
.
It
was
of
course
nothing
to
worry
about
,
he
*NL*
accepted
the
setback
only
because
he
was
looking
for
a
fight
.
If
he
*NL*
stayed
at
home
and
carried
on
with
his
normal
life
he
would
be
a
*NL*
thousand
times
superior
to
these
people
and
could
get
any
of
them
out
of
*NL*
his
way
just
with
a
kick
.
And
he
imagined
the
most
laughable
scene
*NL*
possible
as
an
example
of
this
,
if
this
contemptible
student
,
this
*NL*
inflated
child
,
this
knock-kneed
redbeard
,
if
he
were
kneeling
at
Elsa
's
*NL*
bed
wringing
his
hands
and
begging
for
forgiveness
.
K.
so
enjoyed
*NL*
imagining
this
scene
that
he
decided
to
take
the
student
along
to
Elsa
*NL*
with
him
if
ever
he
should
get
the
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
K.
was
curious
to
see
where
the
woman
would
be
taken
and
he
*NL*
hurried
over
to
the
door
,
the
student
was
not
likely
to
carry
her
*NL*
through
the
streets
on
his
arm
.
It
turned
out
that
the
journey
was
far
*NL*
shorter
.
Directly
opposite
the
flat
there
was
a
narrow
flight
of
wooden
*NL*
steps
which
probably
led
up
to
the
attic
,
they
turned
as
they
went
so
*NL*
that
it
was
not
possible
to
see
where
they
ended
.
The
student
carried
*NL*
the
woman
up
these
steps
,
and
after
the
exertions
of
running
with
her
he
*NL*
was
soon
groaning
and
moving
very
slowly
.
The
woman
waved
down
at
K.
*NL*
and
by
raising
and
lowering
her
shoulders
she
tried
to
show
that
she
was
*NL*
an
innocent
party
in
this
abduction
,
although
the
gesture
did
not
show
a
*NL*
lot
of
regret
.
K.
watched
her
without
expression
like
a
stranger
,
he
*NL*
wanted
to
show
neither
that
he
was
disappointed
nor
that
he
would
easily
*NL*
get
over
his
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
of
them
had
disappeared
,
but
K.
remained
standing
in
the
*NL*
doorway
.
He
had
to
accept
that
the
woman
had
not
only
cheated
him
but
*NL*
that
she
had
also
lied
to
him
when
she
said
she
was
being
taken
to
the
*NL*
examining
judge
.
The
examining
judge
certainly
would
n't
be
sitting
and
*NL*
waiting
in
the
attic
.
The
wooden
stairs
would
explain
nothing
to
him
*NL*
however
long
he
stared
at
them
.
Then
K.
noticed
a
small
piece
of
paper
*NL*
next
to
them
,
went
across
to
it
and
read
,
in
a
childish
and
unpractised
*NL*
hand
,
``
Entrance
to
the
Court
Offices
''
.
Were
the
court
offices
here
,
in
*NL*
the
attic
of
this
tenement
,
then
?
If
that
was
how
they
were
*NL*
accommodated
it
did
not
attract
much
respect
,
and
it
was
some
comfort
*NL*
for
the
accused
to
realise
how
little
money
this
court
had
at
its
*NL*
disposal
if
it
had
to
locate
its
offices
in
a
place
where
the
tenants
of
*NL*
the
building
,
who
were
themselves
among
the
poorest
of
people
,
would
*NL*
throw
their
unneeded
junk
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
was
possible
that
the
*NL*
officials
had
enough
money
but
that
they
squandered
it
on
themselves
*NL*
rather
than
use
it
for
the
court
's
purposes
.
Going
by
K.
's
experience
*NL*
of
them
so
far
,
that
even
seemed
probable
,
except
that
if
the
court
were
*NL*
allowed
to
decay
in
that
way
it
would
not
just
humiliate
the
accused
but
*NL*
also
give
him
more
encouragement
than
if
the
court
were
simply
in
a
*NL*
state
of
poverty
.
K.
also
now
understood
that
the
court
was
ashamed
to
*NL*
summon
those
it
accused
to
the
attic
of
this
building
for
the
initial
*NL*
hearing
,
and
why
it
preferred
to
impose
upon
them
in
their
own
homes
.
*NL*
What
a
position
it
was
that
K.
found
himself
in
,
compared
with
the
judge
*NL*
sitting
up
in
the
attic
!
K.
,
at
the
bank
,
had
a
big
office
with
an
*NL*
ante-room
,
and
had
an
enormous
window
through
which
he
could
look
down
*NL*
at
the
activity
in
the
square
.
It
was
true
,
though
,
that
he
had
no
*NL*
secondary
income
from
bribes
and
fraud
,
and
he
could
n't
tell
a
servant
*NL*
to
bring
him
a
woman
up
to
the
office
on
his
arm
.
K.
,
however
,
was
*NL*
quite
willing
to
do
without
such
things
,
in
this
life
at
least
.
K.
was
*NL*
still
looking
at
the
notice
when
a
man
came
up
the
stairs
,
looked
*NL*
through
the
open
door
into
the
living
room
where
it
was
also
possible
to
*NL*
see
the
courtroom
,
and
finally
asked
K.
whether
he
had
just
seen
a
woman
*NL*
there
.
``
You
're
the
court
usher
,
are
n't
you
?
''
asked
K.
``
That
's
right
,
''
*NL*
said
the
man
,
``
oh
,
yes
,
you
're
defendant
K.
,
I
recognise
you
now
as
*NL*
well
.
Nice
to
see
you
here
.
''
And
he
offered
K.
his
hand
,
which
was
far
*NL*
from
what
K.
had
expected
.
And
when
K.
said
nothing
,
he
added
,
``
There
's
*NL*
no
court
session
planned
for
today
,
though
.
''
``
I
know
that
,
''
said
K.
as
*NL*
he
looked
at
the
usher
's
civilian
coat
which
,
beside
its
ordinary
*NL*
buttons
,
displayed
two
gilded
ones
as
the
only
sign
of
his
office
and
*NL*
seemed
to
have
been
taken
from
an
old
army
officer
's
coat
.
``
I
was
*NL*
speaking
with
your
wife
a
little
while
ago
.
She
is
no
longer
here
.
The
*NL*
student
has
carried
her
off
to
the
examining
judge
.
''
``
Listen
to
this
,
''
*NL*
said
the
usher
,
``
they
're
always
carrying
her
away
from
me
.
It
's
Sunday
*NL*
today
,
and
it
's
not
part
of
my
job
to
do
any
work
today
,
but
they
send
*NL*
me
off
with
some
message
which
is
n't
even
necessary
just
to
get
me
away
*NL*
from
here
.
What
they
do
is
they
send
me
off
not
too
far
away
so
that
I
*NL*
can
still
hope
to
get
back
on
time
if
I
really
hurry
.
So
off
I
go
*NL*
running
as
fast
as
I
can
,
shout
the
message
through
the
crack
in
the
*NL*
door
of
the
office
I
've
been
sent
to
,
so
out
of
breath
they
'll
hardly
be
*NL*
able
to
understand
it
,
run
back
here
again
,
but
the
student
's
been
even
*NL*
faster
than
I
have
-
well
he
's
got
less
far
to
go
,
he
's
only
got
to
run
*NL*
down
the
steps
.
If
I
was
n't
so
dependent
on
them
I
'd
have
squashed
the
*NL*
student
against
the
wall
here
a
long
time
ago
.
Right
here
,
next
to
the
*NL*
sign
.
I
'm
always
dreaming
of
doing
that
.
Just
here
,
just
above
the
*NL*
floor
,
that
's
where
he
's
crushed
onto
the
wall
,
his
arms
stretched
out
,
*NL*
his
fingers
spread
apart
,
his
crooked
legs
twisted
round
into
a
circle
*NL*
and
blood
squirted
out
all
around
him
.
It
's
only
ever
been
a
dream
so
*NL*
far
,
though
.
''
``
Is
there
nothing
else
you
do
?
''
asked
K.
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
that
I
know
of
,
''
said
the
usher
.
``
And
it
's
going
to
get
even
*NL*
worse
now
,
up
till
now
he
's
only
been
carrying
her
off
for
himself
,
now
*NL*
he
's
started
carrying
her
off
for
the
judge
and
all
,
just
like
I
'd
*NL*
always
said
he
would
.
''
``
Does
your
wife
,
then
,
not
share
some
of
the
*NL*
responsibility
?
''
asked
K
.
He
had
to
force
himself
as
he
asked
this
*NL*
question
,
as
he
,
too
,
felt
so
jealous
now
.
``
Course
she
does
,
''
said
the
*NL*
usher
,
``
it
's
more
her
fault
than
theirs
.
It
was
her
who
attached
*NL*
herself
to
him
.
All
he
did
,
he
just
chases
after
any
woman
.
There
's
*NL*
five
flats
in
this
block
alone
where
he
's
been
thrown
out
after
working
*NL*
his
way
in
there
.
And
my
wife
is
the
best
looking
woman
in
the
whole
*NL*
building
,
but
it
's
me
who
's
not
even
allowed
to
defend
himself
.
''
``
If
*NL*
that
's
how
things
are
,
then
there
's
nothing
that
can
be
done
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
``
Well
why
not
?
''
asked
the
usher
.
``
He
's
a
coward
that
student
,
if
he
*NL*
wants
to
lay
a
finger
on
my
wife
all
you
'd
have
to
do
is
give
him
such
a
*NL*
good
hiding
he
'd
never
dare
do
it
again
.
But
I
'm
not
allowed
to
do
*NL*
that
,
and
nobody
else
is
going
to
do
me
the
favour
as
they
're
all
afraid
*NL*
of
his
power
.
The
only
one
who
could
do
it
is
a
man
like
you
.
''
``
What
,
*NL*
how
could
I
do
it
?
''
asked
K.
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
``
Well
you
're
facing
a
charge
,
are
n't
you
,
''
said
the
usher
.
``
Yes
,
but
*NL*
that
's
all
the
more
reason
for
me
to
be
afraid
.
Even
if
he
has
no
*NL*
influence
on
the
outcome
of
the
trial
he
probably
has
some
on
the
*NL*
initial
examination
.
''
``
Yes
,
exactly
,
''
said
the
usher
,
as
if
K.
's
view
*NL*
had
been
just
as
correct
as
his
own
.
``
Only
we
do
n't
usually
get
any
*NL*
trials
heard
here
with
no
hope
at
all
.
''
``
I
am
not
of
the
same
opinion
''
,
*NL*
said
K.
,
``
although
that
ought
not
to
prevent
me
from
dealing
with
the
*NL*
student
if
the
opportunity
arises
.
''
``
I
would
be
very
grateful
to
you
,
''
*NL*
said
the
usher
of
the
court
,
somewhat
formally
,
not
really
seeming
to
*NL*
believe
that
his
highest
wish
could
be
fulfilled
.
``
Perhaps
,
''
continued
*NL*
K.
,
``
perhaps
there
are
some
other
officials
of
yours
here
,
perhaps
all
*NL*
of
them
,
who
would
deserve
the
same
.
''
``
Oh
yes
,
yes
,
''
said
the
usher
,
as
*NL*
if
this
was
a
matter
of
course
.
Then
he
looked
at
K.
trustingly
which
,
*NL*
despite
all
his
friendliness
,
he
had
not
done
until
then
,
and
added
,
*NL*
``
they
're
always
rebelling
.
''
But
the
conversation
seemed
to
have
become
*NL*
a
little
uncomfortable
for
him
,
as
he
broke
it
off
by
saying
,
``
now
I
*NL*
have
to
report
to
the
office
.
Would
you
like
to
come
with
me
?
''
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
for
me
to
do
there
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
``
You
'd
be
able
to
have
a
look
at
it
.
No-one
will
take
any
notice
of
*NL*
you
.
''
``
Is
it
worth
seeing
then
?
''
asked
K.
hesitatingly
,
although
he
*NL*
felt
very
keen
to
go
with
him
.
``
Well
,
''
said
the
usher
,
``
I
thought
you
'd
*NL*
be
interested
in
it
.
''
``
Alright
then
,
''
said
K.
finally
,
``
I
'll
come
with
*NL*
you
.
''
And
,
quicker
than
the
usher
himself
,
he
ran
up
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
entrance
he
nearly
fell
over
,
as
behind
the
door
there
was
*NL*
another
step
.
``
They
do
n't
show
much
concern
for
the
public
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
show
any
concern
at
all
,
''
said
the
usher
,
``
just
look
at
the
*NL*
waiting
room
here
.
''
It
consisted
of
a
long
corridor
from
which
roughly
*NL*
made
doors
led
out
to
the
separate
departments
of
the
attic
.
There
was
*NL*
no
direct
source
of
light
but
it
was
not
entirely
dark
as
many
of
the
*NL*
departments
,
instead
of
solid
walls
,
had
just
wooden
bars
reaching
up
to
*NL*
the
ceiling
to
separate
them
from
the
corridor
.
The
light
made
its
way
*NL*
in
through
them
,
and
it
was
also
possible
to
see
individual
officials
*NL*
through
them
as
they
sat
writing
at
their
desks
or
stood
up
at
the
*NL*
wooden
frameworks
and
watched
the
people
on
the
corridor
through
the
*NL*
gaps
.
There
were
only
a
few
people
in
the
corridor
,
probably
because
it
*NL*
was
Sunday
.
They
were
not
very
impressive
.
They
sat
,
equally
spaced
,
*NL*
on
two
rows
of
long
wooden
benches
which
had
been
placed
along
both
*NL*
sides
of
the
corridor
.
All
of
them
were
carelessly
dressed
although
the
*NL*
expressions
on
their
faces
,
their
bearing
,
the
style
of
their
beards
and
*NL*
many
details
which
were
hard
to
identify
showed
that
they
belonged
to
*NL*
the
upper
classes
.
There
were
no
coat
hooks
for
them
to
use
,
and
so
*NL*
they
had
placed
their
hats
under
the
bench
,
each
probably
having
*NL*
followed
the
example
of
the
others
.
When
those
who
were
sitting
nearest
*NL*
the
door
saw
K.
and
the
usher
of
the
court
they
stood
up
to
greet
them
,
*NL*
and
when
the
others
saw
that
,
they
also
thought
they
had
to
greet
them
,
*NL*
so
that
as
the
two
of
them
went
by
all
the
people
there
stood
up
.
None
*NL*
of
them
stood
properly
upright
,
their
backs
were
bowed
,
their
knees
*NL*
bent
,
they
stood
like
beggars
on
the
street
.
K.
waited
for
the
usher
,
*NL*
who
was
following
just
behind
him
.
``
They
must
all
be
very
dispirited
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
usher
,
``
they
are
the
accused
,
everyone
you
see
*NL*
here
has
been
accused
.
''
``
Really
!
''
said
K.
``
They
're
colleagues
of
mine
*NL*
then
.
''
And
he
turned
to
the
nearest
one
,
a
tall
,
thin
man
with
hair
*NL*
that
was
nearly
grey
.
``
What
is
it
you
are
waiting
for
here
?
''
asked
K.
,
*NL*
politely
,
but
the
man
was
startled
at
being
spoken
to
unexpectedly
,
*NL*
which
was
all
the
more
pitiful
to
see
because
the
man
clearly
had
some
*NL*
experience
of
the
world
and
elsewhere
would
certainly
have
been
able
to
*NL*
show
his
superiority
and
would
not
have
easily
given
up
the
advantage
he
*NL*
had
acquired
.
Here
,
though
,
he
did
not
know
what
answer
to
give
to
such
*NL*
a
simple
question
and
looked
round
at
the
others
as
if
they
were
under
*NL*
some
obligation
to
help
him
,
and
as
if
no-one
could
expect
any
answer
*NL*
from
him
without
this
help
.
Then
the
usher
of
the
court
stepped
forward
*NL*
to
him
and
,
in
order
to
calm
him
down
and
raise
his
spirits
,
said
,
``
The
*NL*
gentleman
here
's
only
asking
what
it
is
you
're
waiting
for
.
You
can
*NL*
give
him
an
answer
.
''
The
voice
of
the
usher
was
probably
familiar
to
*NL*
him
,
and
had
a
better
effect
than
K.
's
.
``
I
'm
...
I
'm
waiting
...
''
he
*NL*
began
,
and
then
came
to
a
halt
.
He
had
clearly
chosen
this
beginning
so
*NL*
that
he
could
give
a
precise
answer
to
the
question
,
but
now
he
did
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
continue
.
Some
of
the
others
waiting
had
come
closer
and
*NL*
stood
round
the
group
,
the
usher
of
the
court
said
to
them
,
``
Get
out
the
*NL*
way
,
keep
the
gangway
free
.
''
They
moved
back
slightly
,
but
not
as
far
*NL*
as
where
they
had
been
sitting
before
.
In
the
meantime
,
the
man
whom
K.
*NL*
had
first
approached
had
pulled
himself
together
and
even
answered
him
*NL*
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
``
A
month
ago
I
made
some
applications
for
evidence
to
be
heard
in
my
*NL*
case
,
and
I
'm
waiting
for
it
to
be
settled
.
''
``
You
certainly
seem
to
be
*NL*
going
to
a
lot
of
effort
,
''
said
K.
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
it
is
my
*NL*
affair
after
all
.
''
``
Not
everyone
thinks
the
same
way
as
you
do
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
``
I
've
been
indicted
as
well
but
I
swear
on
my
soul
that
I
've
neither
*NL*
submitted
evidence
nor
done
anything
else
of
the
sort
.
Do
you
really
*NL*
think
that
's
necessary
?
''
``
I
do
n't
really
know
,
exactly
,
''
said
the
man
,
*NL*
once
more
totally
unsure
of
himself
;
he
clearly
thought
K.
was
joking
*NL*
with
him
and
therefore
probably
thought
it
best
to
repeat
his
earlier
*NL*
answer
in
order
to
avoid
making
any
new
mistakes
.
With
K.
looking
at
*NL*
him
impatiently
,
he
just
said
,
``
as
far
as
I
'm
concerned
,
I
've
applied
to
*NL*
have
this
evidence
heard
.
''
``
Perhaps
you
do
n't
believe
I
've
been
*NL*
indicted
?
''
asked
K.
``
Oh
,
please
,
I
certainly
do
,
''
said
the
man
,
*NL*
stepping
slightly
to
one
side
,
but
there
was
more
anxiety
in
his
answer
*NL*
than
belief
.
``
You
do
n't
believe
me
then
?
''
asked
K.
,
and
took
hold
of
*NL*
his
arm
,
unconsciously
prompted
by
the
man
's
humble
demeanour
,
and
as
if
*NL*
he
wanted
to
force
him
to
believe
him
.
But
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
the
*NL*
man
and
had
only
taken
hold
of
him
very
lightly
.
Nonetheless
,
the
man
*NL*
cried
out
as
if
K.
had
grasped
him
not
with
two
fingers
but
with
red
hot
*NL*
tongs
.
Shouting
in
this
ridiculous
way
finally
made
K.
tired
of
him
,
if
*NL*
he
did
n't
believe
he
was
indicted
then
so
much
the
better
;
maybe
he
even
*NL*
thought
K.
was
a
judge
.
And
before
leaving
,
he
held
him
a
lot
harder
,
*NL*
shoved
him
back
onto
the
bench
and
walked
on
.
``
These
defendants
are
so
*NL*
sensitive
,
most
of
them
,
''
said
the
usher
of
the
court
.
Almost
all
of
*NL*
those
who
had
been
waiting
had
now
assembled
around
the
man
who
,
by
now
,
*NL*
had
stopped
shouting
and
they
seemed
to
be
asking
him
lots
of
precise
*NL*
questions
about
the
incident
.
K.
was
approached
by
a
security
guard
,
*NL*
identifiable
mainly
by
his
sword
,
of
which
the
scabbard
seemed
to
be
*NL*
made
of
aluminium
.
This
greatly
surprised
K.
,
and
he
reached
out
for
it
*NL*
with
his
hand
.
The
guard
had
come
because
of
the
shouting
and
asked
*NL*
what
had
been
happening
.
The
usher
of
the
court
said
a
few
words
to
try
*NL*
and
calm
him
down
but
the
guard
explained
that
he
had
to
look
into
it
*NL*
himself
,
saluted
,
and
hurried
on
,
walking
with
very
short
steps
,
*NL*
probably
because
of
gout
.
*NL*
*NL*
K.
did
n't
concern
himself
long
with
the
guard
or
these
people
,
*NL*
especially
as
he
saw
a
turning
off
the
corridor
,
about
half
way
along
it
*NL*
on
the
right
hand
side
,
where
there
was
no
door
to
stop
him
going
that
*NL*
way
.
He
asked
the
usher
whether
that
was
the
right
way
to
go
,
the
usher
*NL*
nodded
,
and
that
is
the
way
that
K.
went
.
The
usher
remained
always
one
*NL*
or
two
steps
behind
K
,
which
he
found
irritating
as
in
a
place
like
this
*NL*
it
could
give
the
impression
that
he
was
being
driven
along
by
someone
*NL*
who
had
arrested
him
,
so
he
frequently
waited
for
the
usher
to
catch
up
,
*NL*
but
the
usher
always
remained
behind
him
.
In
order
to
put
an
end
to
his
*NL*
discomfort
,
K.
finally
said
,
``
Now
that
I
've
seen
what
it
looks
like
*NL*
here
,
I
'd
like
to
go
.
''
``
You
have
n't
seen
everything
yet
,
''
said
the
*NL*
usher
ingenuously
.
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
see
everything
,
''
said
K.
,
who
was
also
feeling
very
*NL*
tired
,
``
I
want
to
go
,
what
is
the
way
to
the
exit
?
''
``
You
have
n't
got
*NL*
lost
,
have
you
?
''
asked
the
usher
in
amazement
,
``
you
go
down
this
way
to
*NL*
the
corner
,
then
right
down
the
corridor
straight
ahead
as
far
as
the
*NL*
door
.
''
``
Come
with
me
,
''
said
K.
,
``
show
me
the
way
,
I
'll
miss
it
,
there
*NL*
are
so
many
different
ways
here
.
''
``
It
's
the
only
way
there
is
,
''
said
*NL*
the
usher
,
who
had
now
started
to
sound
quite
reproachful
,
``
I
ca
n't
go
*NL*
back
with
you
again
,
I
've
got
to
hand
in
my
report
,
and
I
've
already
*NL*
lost
a
lot
of
time
because
of
you
as
it
is
.
''
``
Come
with
me
!
''
K.
*NL*
repeated
,
now
somewhat
sharper
as
if
he
had
finally
caught
the
usher
out
*NL*
in
a
lie
.
``
Do
n't
shout
like
that
,
''
whispered
the
usher
,
``
there
's
*NL*
offices
all
round
us
here
.
If
you
do
n't
want
to
go
back
by
yourself
*NL*
come
on
a
bit
further
with
me
or
else
wait
here
till
I
've
sorted
out
my
*NL*
report
,
then
I
'll
be
glad
to
go
back
with
you
again
.
''
``
No
,
no
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
,
``
I
will
not
wait
and
you
must
come
with
me
now
.
''
K.
had
still
not
*NL*
looked
round
at
anything
at
all
in
the
room
where
he
found
himself
,
and
*NL*
it
was
only
when
one
of
the
many
wooden
doors
all
around
him
opened
that
*NL*
he
noticed
it
.
A
young
woman
,
probably
summoned
by
the
loudness
of
K.
's
*NL*
voice
,
entered
and
asked
,
``
What
is
it
the
gentleman
wants
?
''
In
the
*NL*
darkness
behind
her
there
was
also
a
man
approaching
.
K.
looked
at
the
*NL*
usher
.
He
had
,
after
all
,
said
that
no-one
would
take
any
notice
of
K.
,
*NL*
and
now
there
were
two
people
coming
,
it
only
needed
a
few
and
everyone
*NL*
in
the
office
would
become
aware
of
him
and
asking
for
explanations
as
*NL*
to
why
he
was
there
.
The
only
understandable
and
acceptable
thing
to
*NL*
say
was
that
he
was
accused
of
something
and
wanted
to
know
the
date
of
*NL*
his
next
hearing
,
but
this
was
an
explanation
he
did
not
want
to
give
,
*NL*
especially
as
it
was
not
true
-
he
had
only
come
out
of
curiosity
.
Or
*NL*
else
,
an
explanation
even
less
usable
,
he
could
say
that
he
wanted
to
*NL*
ascertain
that
the
court
was
as
revolting
on
the
inside
as
it
was
on
the
*NL*
outside
.
And
it
did
seem
that
he
had
been
quite
right
in
this
*NL*
supposition
,
he
had
no
wish
to
intrude
any
deeper
,
he
was
disturbed
*NL*
enough
by
what
he
had
seen
already
,
he
was
not
in
the
right
frame
of
*NL*
mind
just
then
to
face
a
high
official
such
as
might
appear
from
behind
*NL*
any
door
,
and
he
wanted
to
go
,
either
with
the
usher
of
the
court
or
,
if
*NL*
needs
be
,
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
must
have
seemed
very
odd
standing
there
in
silence
,
and
*NL*
the
young
woman
and
the
usher
were
indeed
looking
at
him
as
if
they
*NL*
thought
he
would
go
through
some
major
metamorphosis
any
second
which
*NL*
they
did
n't
want
to
miss
seeing
.
And
in
the
doorway
stood
the
man
whom
*NL*
K.
had
noticed
in
the
background
earlier
,
he
held
firmly
on
to
the
beam
*NL*
above
the
low
door
swinging
a
little
on
the
tips
of
his
feet
as
if
*NL*
becoming
impatient
as
he
watched
.
But
the
young
woman
was
the
first
to
*NL*
recognise
that
K.
's
behaviour
was
caused
by
his
feeling
slightly
unwell
,
*NL*
she
brought
a
chair
and
asked
,
*NL*
``
Would
you
not
like
to
sit
down
?
''
K.
sat
down
immediately
and
,
in
order
*NL*
to
keep
his
place
better
,
put
his
elbows
on
the
armrests
.
``
You
're
a
*NL*
little
bit
dizzy
,
are
n't
you
?
''
she
asked
him
.
Her
face
was
now
close
in
*NL*
front
of
him
,
it
bore
the
severe
expression
that
many
young
women
have
*NL*
just
when
they
're
in
the
bloom
of
their
youth
.
``
It
's
nothing
for
you
to
*NL*
worry
about
,
''
she
said
,
``
that
's
nothing
unusual
here
,
almost
everyone
*NL*
gets
an
attack
like
that
the
first
time
they
come
here
.
This
is
your
*NL*
first
time
is
it
?
Yes
,
it
's
nothing
unusual
then
.
The
sun
burns
down
*NL*
on
the
roof
and
the
hot
wood
makes
the
air
so
thick
and
heavy
.
It
makes
*NL*
this
place
rather
unsuitable
for
offices
,
whatever
other
advantages
it
*NL*
might
offer
.
But
the
air
is
almost
impossible
to
breathe
on
days
when
*NL*
there
's
a
lot
of
business
,
and
that
's
almost
every
day
.
And
when
you
*NL*
think
that
there
's
a
lot
of
washing
put
out
to
dry
here
as
well
-
and
we
*NL*
ca
n't
stop
the
tenants
doing
that
-
it
's
not
surprising
you
started
to
*NL*
feel
unwell
.
But
you
get
used
to
the
air
alright
in
the
end
.
When
*NL*
you
're
here
for
the
second
or
third
time
you
'll
hardly
notice
how
*NL*
oppressive
the
air
is
.
Are
you
feeling
any
better
now
?
''
K.
made
no
*NL*
answer
,
he
felt
too
embarrassed
at
being
put
at
the
mercy
of
these
*NL*
people
by
his
sudden
weakness
,
and
learning
the
reason
for
feeling
ill
*NL*
made
him
feel
not
better
but
a
little
worse
.
The
girl
noticed
it
*NL*
straight
away
,
and
to
make
the
air
fresher
for
K.
,
she
took
a
window
*NL*
pole
that
was
leaning
against
the
wall
and
pushed
open
a
small
hatch
*NL*
directly
above
K.
's
head
that
led
to
the
outside
.
But
so
much
soot
fell
*NL*
in
that
the
girl
had
to
immediately
close
the
hatch
again
and
clean
the
*NL*
soot
off
K.
's
hands
with
her
handkerchief
,
as
K.
was
too
tired
to
do
*NL*
that
for
himself
.
He
would
have
liked
just
to
sit
quietly
where
he
was
*NL*
until
he
had
enough
strength
to
leave
,
and
the
less
fuss
people
made
*NL*
about
him
the
sooner
that
would
be
.
But
then
the
girl
said
,
``
You
ca
n't
*NL*
stay
here
,
we
're
in
people
's
way
here
...
''
K.
looked
at
her
as
if
to
*NL*
ask
whose
way
they
were
impeding
.
``
If
you
like
,
I
can
take
you
to
the
*NL*
sick
room
,
''
and
turning
to
the
man
in
the
doorway
said
,
``
please
help
*NL*
me
''
.
The
man
immediately
came
over
to
them
,
but
K.
did
not
want
to
go
*NL*
to
the
sick
room
,
that
was
just
what
he
wanted
to
avoid
,
being
led
*NL*
further
from
place
to
place
,
the
further
he
went
the
more
difficult
it
*NL*
must
become
.
So
he
said
,
``
I
am
able
to
walk
now
,
''
and
stood
up
,
shaking
*NL*
after
becoming
used
to
sitting
so
comfortably
.
But
then
he
was
unable
*NL*
to
stay
upright
.
``
I
ca
n't
manage
it
,
''
he
said
shaking
his
head
,
and
sat
*NL*
down
again
with
a
sigh
.
He
remembered
the
usher
who
,
despite
*NL*
everything
,
would
have
been
able
to
lead
him
out
of
there
but
who
seemed
*NL*
to
have
gone
long
before
.
K.
looked
out
between
the
man
and
the
young
*NL*
woman
who
were
standing
in
front
of
him
but
was
unable
to
find
the
*NL*
usher
.
``
I
think
,
''
said
the
man
,
who
was
elegantly
dressed
and
whose
*NL*
appearance
was
made
especially
impressive
with
a
grey
waistcoat
that
had
*NL*
two
long
,
sharply
tailored
points
,
``
the
gentleman
is
feeling
unwell
*NL*
because
of
the
atmosphere
here
,
so
the
best
thing
,
and
what
he
would
*NL*
most
prefer
,
would
be
not
to
take
him
to
the
sick
room
but
get
him
out
*NL*
of
the
offices
altogether
.
''
``
That
's
right
,
''
exclaimed
K.
,
with
such
joy
*NL*
that
he
nearly
interrupted
what
the
man
was
saying
,
``
I
'm
sure
that
'll
*NL*
make
me
feel
better
straight
away
,
I
'm
really
not
that
weak
,
all
I
need
*NL*
is
a
little
support
under
my
arms
,
I
wo
n't
cause
you
much
trouble
,
it
's
*NL*
not
such
a
long
way
anyway
,
lead
me
to
the
door
and
then
I
'll
sit
on
the
*NL*
stairs
for
a
while
and
soon
recover
,
as
I
do
n't
suffer
from
attacks
like
*NL*
this
at
all
,
I
'm
surprised
at
it
myself
.
I
also
work
in
an
office
and
*NL*
I
'm
quite
used
to
office
air
,
but
here
it
seems
to
be
too
strong
,
you
've
*NL*
said
so
yourselves
.
So
please
,
be
so
kind
as
to
help
me
on
my
way
a
*NL*
little
,
I
'm
feeling
dizzy
,
you
see
,
and
it
'll
make
me
ill
if
I
stand
up
*NL*
by
myself
.
''
And
with
that
he
raised
his
shoulders
to
make
it
easier
for
*NL*
the
two
of
them
to
take
him
by
the
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
,
however
,
did
n't
follow
this
suggestion
but
just
stood
*NL*
there
with
his
hands
in
his
trouser
pockets
and
laughed
out
loud
.
*NL*
``
There
,
you
see
,
''
he
said
to
the
girl
,
``
I
was
quite
right
.
The
*NL*
gentleman
is
only
unwell
here
,
and
not
in
general
.
''
The
young
woman
*NL*
smiled
too
,
but
lightly
tapped
the
man
's
arm
with
the
tips
of
her
*NL*
fingers
as
if
he
had
allowed
himself
too
much
fun
with
K.
``
So
what
do
*NL*
you
think
,
then
?
''
said
the
man
,
still
laughing
,
``
I
really
do
want
to
*NL*
lead
the
gentleman
out
of
here
.
''
``
That
's
alright
,
then
,
''
said
the
girl
,
*NL*
briefly
inclining
her
charming
head
.
``
Do
n't
worry
too
much
about
him
*NL*
laughing
,
''
said
the
girl
to
K.
,
who
had
become
unhappy
once
more
and
*NL*
stared
quietly
in
front
of
himself
as
if
needing
no
further
explanation
.
*NL*
``
This
gentleman
-
may
I
introduce
you
?
''
-
-LRB-
the
man
gave
his
permission
*NL*
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
-RRB-
-
``
so
,
this
gentleman
's
job
is
to
give
out
*NL*
information
.
He
gives
all
the
information
they
need
to
people
who
are
*NL*
waiting
,
as
our
court
and
its
offices
are
not
very
well
known
among
the
*NL*
public
he
gets
asked
for
quite
a
lot
.
He
has
an
answer
for
every
*NL*
question
,
you
can
try
him
out
if
you
feel
like
it
.
But
that
's
not
his
*NL*
only
distinction
,
his
other
distinction
is
his
elegance
of
dress
.
We
,
*NL*
that
's
to
say
all
of
us
who
work
in
the
offices
here
,
we
decided
that
*NL*
the
information-giver
would
have
to
be
elegantly
dressed
as
he
*NL*
continually
has
to
deal
with
the
litigants
and
he
's
the
first
one
they
*NL*
meet
,
so
he
needs
to
give
a
dignified
first
impression
.
The
rest
of
us
*NL*
I
'm
afraid
,
as
you
can
see
just
by
looking
at
me
,
dress
very
badly
and
*NL*
old-fashioned
;
and
there
's
not
much
point
in
spending
much
on
clothes
*NL*
anyway
,
as
we
hardly
ever
leave
the
offices
,
we
even
sleep
here
.
But
,
*NL*
as
I
said
,
we
decided
that
the
information-giver
would
have
to
have
nice
*NL*
clothes
.
As
the
management
here
is
rather
peculiar
in
this
respect
,
and
*NL*
they
would
get
them
for
us
,
we
had
a
collection
-
some
of
the
litigants
*NL*
contributed
too
-
and
bought
him
these
lovely
clothes
and
some
others
*NL*
besides
.
So
everything
would
be
ready
for
him
to
give
a
good
*NL*
impression
,
except
that
he
spoils
it
again
by
laughing
and
frightening
*NL*
people
.
''
``
That
's
how
it
is
,
''
said
the
man
,
mocking
her
,
``
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
understand
why
it
is
that
you
're
explaining
all
our
intimate
facts
to
*NL*
the
gentleman
,
or
rather
why
it
is
that
you
're
pressing
them
on
him
,
as
*NL*
I
'm
sure
he
's
not
all
interested
.
Just
look
at
him
sitting
there
,
it
's
*NL*
clear
he
's
occupied
with
his
own
affairs
.
''
K.
just
did
not
feel
like
*NL*
contradicting
him
.
.
The
girl
's
intention
may
have
been
good
,
perhaps
she
*NL*
was
under
instructions
to
distract
him
or
to
give
him
the
chance
to
*NL*
collect
himself
,
but
the
attempt
had
not
worked
.
``
I
had
to
explain
to
*NL*
him
why
you
were
laughing
,
''
said
the
girl
.
``
I
suppose
it
was
*NL*
insulting
.
''
``
I
think
he
would
forgive
even
worse
insults
if
I
finally
*NL*
took
him
outside
.
''
K.
said
nothing
,
did
not
even
look
up
,
he
tolerated
*NL*
the
two
of
them
negotiating
over
him
like
an
object
,
that
was
even
what
*NL*
suited
him
best
.
But
suddenly
he
felt
the
information-giver
's
hand
on
*NL*
one
arm
and
the
young
woman
's
hand
on
the
other
.
``
Up
you
get
then
,
*NL*
weakling
,
''
said
the
information-giver
.
``
Thank
you
both
very
much
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
,
pleasantly
surprised
,
as
he
slowly
rose
and
personally
guided
these
*NL*
unfamiliar
hands
to
the
places
where
he
most
needed
support
.
*NL*
As
they
approached
the
corridor
,
the
girl
said
quietly
into
K.
's
ear
,
``
I
*NL*
must
seem
to
think
it
's
very
important
to
show
the
information-giver
in
*NL*
a
good
light
,
but
you
should
n't
doubt
what
I
say
,
I
just
want
to
say
the
*NL*
truth
.
He
is
n't
hard-hearted
.
It
's
not
really
his
job
to
help
*NL*
litigants
outside
if
they
're
unwell
but
he
's
doing
it
anyway
,
as
you
can
*NL*
see
.
I
do
n't
suppose
any
of
us
is
hard-hearted
,
perhaps
we
'd
all
like
*NL*
to
be
helpful
,
but
working
for
the
court
offices
it
's
easy
for
us
to
*NL*
give
the
impression
we
are
hard-hearted
and
do
n't
want
to
help
anyone
.
*NL*
It
makes
me
quite
sad
.
''
``
Would
you
not
like
to
sit
down
here
a
while
?
''
*NL*
asked
the
information-giver
,
there
were
already
in
the
corridor
and
just
*NL*
in
front
of
the
defendant
whom
K.
had
spoken
to
earlier
.
K.
felt
almost
*NL*
ashamed
to
be
seen
by
him
,
earlier
he
had
stood
so
upright
in
front
of
*NL*
him
and
now
he
had
to
be
supported
by
two
others
,
his
hat
was
held
up
by
*NL*
the
information-giver
balanced
on
outstretched
fingers
,
his
hair
was
*NL*
dishevelled
and
hung
down
onto
the
sweat
on
his
forehead
.
But
the
*NL*
defendant
seemed
to
notice
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
and
just
stood
*NL*
there
humbly
,
as
if
wanting
to
apologise
to
the
information-giver
for
*NL*
being
there
.
The
information-giver
looked
past
him
.
``
I
know
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
that
my
case
ca
n't
be
settled
today
,
not
yet
,
but
I
've
come
in
anyway
,
*NL*
I
thought
,
I
thought
I
could
wait
here
anyway
,
it
's
Sunday
today
,
I
've
*NL*
got
plenty
of
time
,
and
I
'm
not
disturbing
anyone
here
.
''
``
There
's
no
*NL*
need
to
be
so
apologetic
,
''
said
the
information-giver
,
``
it
's
very
*NL*
commendable
for
you
to
be
so
attentive
.
You
are
taking
up
space
here
*NL*
when
you
do
n't
need
to
but
as
long
as
you
do
n't
get
in
my
way
I
will
do
*NL*
nothing
to
stop
you
following
the
progress
of
your
case
as
closely
as
*NL*
you
like
.
When
one
has
seen
so
many
people
who
shamefully
neglect
their
*NL*
cases
one
learns
to
show
patience
with
people
like
you
.
Do
sit
down
.
''
*NL*
``
He
's
very
good
with
the
litigants
,
''
whispered
the
girl
.
K.
nodded
,
but
*NL*
started
to
move
off
again
when
the
information-giver
repeated
,
``
Would
*NL*
you
not
like
to
sit
down
here
a
while
?
''
``
No
,
''
said
K.
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
rest
.
''
He
had
said
that
as
decisively
as
he
could
,
but
in
fact
it
*NL*
would
have
done
him
a
lot
of
good
to
sit
down
.
It
was
as
if
he
were
*NL*
suffering
sea-sickness
.
He
felt
as
if
he
were
on
a
ship
in
a
rough
sea
,
*NL*
as
if
the
water
were
hitting
against
the
wooden
walls
,
a
thundering
from
*NL*
the
depths
of
the
corridor
as
if
the
torrent
were
crashing
over
it
,
as
*NL*
if
the
corridor
were
swaying
and
the
waiting
litigants
on
each
side
of
*NL*
it
rising
and
sinking
.
It
made
the
calmness
of
the
girl
and
the
man
*NL*
leading
him
all
the
more
incomprehensible
.
He
was
at
their
mercy
,
if
*NL*
they
let
go
of
him
he
would
fall
like
a
board
.
Their
little
eyes
*NL*
glanced
here
and
there
,
K.
could
feel
the
evenness
of
their
steps
but
*NL*
could
not
do
the
same
,
as
from
step
to
step
he
was
virtually
being
*NL*
carried
.
He
finally
noticed
they
were
speaking
to
him
but
he
did
not
*NL*
understand
them
,
all
he
heard
was
a
noise
that
filled
all
the
space
and
*NL*
through
which
there
seemed
to
be
an
unchanging
higher
note
sounding
,
*NL*
like
a
siren
.
``
Louder
,
''
he
whispered
with
his
head
sunk
low
,
ashamed
at
*NL*
having
to
ask
them
to
speak
louder
when
he
knew
they
had
spoken
loudly
*NL*
enough
,
even
if
it
had
been
,
for
him
,
incomprehensible
.
At
last
,
a
*NL*
draught
of
cool
air
blew
in
his
face
as
if
a
gap
had
been
torn
out
in
*NL*
the
wall
in
front
of
him
,
and
next
to
him
he
heard
someone
say
,
``
First
*NL*
he
says
he
wants
to
go
,
and
then
you
can
tell
him
a
hundred
times
that
*NL*
this
is
the
way
out
and
he
does
n't
move
.
''
K.
became
aware
that
he
was
*NL*
standing
in
front
of
the
way
out
,
and
that
the
young
woman
had
opened
*NL*
the
door
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
all
his
strength
returned
to
him
at
*NL*
once
,
and
to
get
a
foretaste
of
freedom
he
stepped
straight
on
to
one
of
*NL*
the
stairs
and
took
his
leave
there
of
his
companions
,
who
bowed
to
him
.
*NL*
``
Thank
you
very
much
,
''
he
repeated
,
shook
their
hands
once
more
and
did
*NL*
not
let
go
until
he
thought
he
saw
that
they
found
it
hard
to
bear
the
*NL*
comparatively
fresh
air
from
the
stairway
after
being
so
long
used
to
*NL*
the
air
in
the
offices
.
They
were
hardly
able
to
reply
,
and
the
young
*NL*
woman
might
even
have
fallen
over
if
K.
had
not
shut
the
door
extremely
*NL*
fast
.
K.
then
stood
still
for
a
while
,
combed
his
hair
with
the
help
of
*NL*
a
pocket
mirror
,
picked
up
his
hat
from
the
next
stair
-
the
*NL*
information-giver
must
have
thrown
it
down
there
-
and
then
he
ran
down
*NL*
the
steps
so
fresh
and
in
such
long
leaps
that
the
contrast
with
his
*NL*
previous
state
nearly
frightened
him
.
His
normally
sturdy
state
of
*NL*
health
had
never
prepared
him
for
surprises
such
as
this
.
Did
his
body
*NL*
want
to
revolt
and
cause
him
a
new
trial
as
he
was
bearing
the
old
one
*NL*
with
such
little
effort
?
He
did
not
quite
reject
the
idea
that
he
*NL*
should
see
a
doctor
the
next
time
he
had
the
chance
,
but
whatever
he
did
*NL*
-
and
this
was
something
on
which
he
could
advise
himself
-
he
wanted
to
*NL*
spend
all
Sunday
mornings
in
future
better
than
he
had
spent
this
one
.

Chapter
Four
*NL*
Miss
Buerstner
's
Friend
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
after
this
,
K.
found
it
impossible
to
exchange
even
*NL*
just
a
few
words
with
Miss
Buerstner
.
He
tried
to
reach
her
in
many
and
*NL*
various
ways
but
she
always
found
a
way
to
avoid
it
.
He
would
come
*NL*
straight
home
from
the
office
,
remain
in
her
room
without
the
light
on
,
*NL*
and
sit
on
the
sofa
with
nothing
more
to
distract
him
than
keeping
watch
*NL*
on
the
empty
hallway
.
If
the
maid
went
by
and
closed
the
door
of
the
*NL*
apparently
empty
room
he
would
get
up
after
a
while
and
open
it
again
.
*NL*
He
got
up
an
hour
earlier
than
usual
in
the
morning
so
that
he
might
*NL*
perhaps
find
Miss
Buerstner
alone
as
she
went
to
the
office
.
But
none
of
*NL*
these
efforts
brought
any
success
.
Then
he
wrote
her
a
letter
,
both
to
*NL*
the
office
and
the
flat
,
attempting
once
more
to
justify
his
behaviour
,
*NL*
offered
to
make
whatever
amends
he
could
,
promised
never
to
cross
*NL*
whatever
boundary
she
might
set
him
and
begged
merely
to
have
the
chance
*NL*
to
speak
to
her
some
time
,
especially
as
he
was
unable
to
do
anything
*NL*
with
Mrs.
Grubach
either
until
he
had
spoken
with
Miss
Buerstner
,
he
*NL*
finally
informed
her
that
the
following
Sunday
he
would
stay
in
his
room
*NL*
all
day
waiting
for
a
sign
from
her
that
there
was
some
hope
of
his
*NL*
request
being
fulfilled
,
or
at
least
that
she
would
explain
to
him
why
*NL*
she
could
not
fulfil
it
even
though
he
had
promised
to
observe
whatever
*NL*
stipulations
she
might
make
.
The
letters
were
not
returned
,
but
there
*NL*
was
no
answer
either
.
However
,
on
the
following
Sunday
there
was
a
sign
*NL*
that
seemed
clear
enough
.
It
was
still
early
when
K.
noticed
,
through
*NL*
the
keyhole
,
that
there
was
an
unusual
level
of
activity
in
the
hallway
*NL*
which
soon
abated
.
A
French
teacher
,
although
she
was
German
and
called
*NL*
Montag
,
a
pale
and
febrile
girl
with
a
slight
limp
who
had
previously
*NL*
occupied
a
room
of
her
own
,
was
moving
into
Miss
Buerstner
's
room
.
She
*NL*
could
be
seen
shuffling
through
the
hallway
for
several
hours
,
there
was
*NL*
always
another
piece
of
clothing
or
a
blanket
or
a
book
that
she
had
*NL*
forgotten
and
had
to
be
fetched
specially
and
brought
into
the
new
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Grubach
brought
K.
his
breakfast
-
ever
since
the
time
*NL*
when
she
had
made
K.
so
cross
she
did
n't
trust
the
maid
to
do
the
*NL*
slightest
job
-
he
had
no
choice
but
to
speak
to
her
,
for
the
first
time
*NL*
in
five
days
.
``
Why
is
there
so
much
noise
in
the
hallway
today
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
as
she
poured
his
coffee
out
,
``
Ca
n't
something
be
done
about
it
?
*NL*
Does
this
clearing
out
have
to
be
done
on
a
Sunday
?
''
K.
did
not
look
up
*NL*
at
Mrs.
Grubach
,
but
he
saw
nonetheless
that
she
seemed
to
feel
some
*NL*
relief
as
she
breathed
in
.
Even
sharp
questions
like
this
from
Mr.
K.
*NL*
she
perceived
as
forgiveness
,
or
as
the
beginning
of
forgiveness
.
*NL*
``
We
're
not
clearing
anything
out
,
Mr.
K.
,
''
she
said
,
``
it
's
just
that
*NL*
Miss
Montag
is
moving
in
with
Miss
Buerstner
and
is
moving
her
things
*NL*
across
.
''
She
said
nothing
more
,
but
just
waited
to
see
how
K.
would
*NL*
take
it
and
whether
he
would
allow
her
to
carry
on
speaking
.
But
K.
*NL*
kept
her
in
uncertainty
,
took
the
spoon
and
pensively
stirred
his
coffee
*NL*
while
he
remained
silent
.
Then
he
looked
up
at
her
and
said
,
``
What
*NL*
about
the
suspicions
you
had
earlier
about
Miss
Buerstner
,
have
you
given
*NL*
them
up
?
''
``
Mr.
K.
,
''
called
Mrs.
Grubach
,
who
had
been
waiting
for
this
*NL*
very
question
,
as
she
put
her
hands
together
and
held
them
out
towards
*NL*
him
.
``
I
just
made
a
chance
remark
and
you
took
it
so
badly
.
I
did
n't
*NL*
have
the
slightest
intention
of
offending
anyone
,
not
you
or
anyone
*NL*
else
.
You
've
known
me
for
long
enough
,
Mr.
K.
,
I
'm
sure
you
're
*NL*
convinced
of
that
.
You
do
n't
know
how
I
've
been
suffering
for
the
past
*NL*
few
days
!
That
I
should
tell
lies
about
my
tenants
!
And
you
,
Mr.
K.
,
*NL*
you
believed
it
!
And
said
I
should
give
you
notice
!
Give
you
notice
!
''
*NL*
At
this
last
outcry
,
Mrs.
Grubach
was
already
choking
back
her
tears
,
*NL*
she
raised
her
apron
to
her
face
and
blubbered
out
loud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
cry
Mrs.
Grubach
,
''
said
K.
,
looking
out
the
window
,
he
*NL*
was
thinking
only
of
Miss
Buerstner
and
how
she
was
accepting
an
unknown
*NL*
girl
into
her
room
.
``
Now
do
n't
cry
,
''
he
said
again
as
he
turned
his
*NL*
look
back
into
the
room
where
Mrs.
Grubach
was
still
crying
.
``
I
meant
*NL*
no
harm
either
when
I
said
that
.
It
was
simply
a
misunderstanding
*NL*
between
us
.
That
can
happen
even
between
old
friends
sometimes
.
''
Mrs.
*NL*
Grubach
pulled
her
apron
down
to
below
her
eyes
to
see
whether
K.
really
*NL*
was
attempting
a
reconciliation
.
``
Well
,
yes
,
that
's
how
it
is
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
,
and
as
Mrs.
Grubach
's
behaviour
indicated
that
the
captain
had
said
*NL*
nothing
he
dared
to
add
,
``
Do
you
really
think
,
then
,
that
I
'd
want
to
*NL*
make
an
enemy
of
you
for
the
sake
of
a
girl
we
hardly
know
?
''
``
Yes
,
*NL*
you
're
quite
right
,
Mr.
K.
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grubach
,
and
then
,
to
her
*NL*
misfortune
,
as
soon
as
she
felt
just
a
little
freer
to
speak
,
she
added
*NL*
something
rather
inept
.
``
I
kept
asking
myself
why
it
was
that
Mr.
K.
*NL*
took
such
an
interest
in
Miss
Buerstner
.
Why
does
he
quarrel
with
me
*NL*
over
her
when
he
knows
that
any
cross
word
from
him
and
I
ca
n't
sleep
*NL*
that
night
?
And
I
did
n't
say
anything
about
Miss
Buerstner
that
I
had
n't
*NL*
seen
with
my
own
eyes
.
''
K.
said
nothing
in
reply
,
he
should
have
chased
*NL*
her
from
the
room
as
soon
as
she
had
opened
her
mouth
,
and
he
did
n't
*NL*
want
to
do
that
.
He
contented
himself
with
merely
drinking
his
coffee
*NL*
and
letting
Mrs.
Grubach
feel
that
she
was
superfluous
.
Outside
,
the
*NL*
dragging
steps
of
Miss
Montag
could
still
be
heard
as
she
went
from
one
*NL*
side
of
the
hallway
to
the
other
.
``
Do
you
hear
that
?
''
asked
K.
pointing
*NL*
his
hand
at
the
door
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grubach
with
a
sigh
,
``
I
wanted
*NL*
to
give
her
some
help
and
I
wanted
the
maid
to
help
her
too
but
she
's
*NL*
stubborn
,
she
wants
to
move
everything
in
herself
.
I
wonder
at
Miss
*NL*
Buerstner
.
I
often
feel
it
's
a
burden
for
me
to
have
Miss
Montag
as
a
*NL*
tenant
but
Miss
Buerstner
accepts
her
into
her
room
with
herself
.
''
*NL*
``
There
's
nothing
there
for
you
to
worry
about
''
said
K.
,
crushing
the
*NL*
remains
of
a
sugar
lump
in
his
cup
.
``
Does
she
cause
you
any
trouble
?
''
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grubach
,
``
in
itself
it
's
very
good
to
have
her
there
,
it
*NL*
makes
another
room
free
for
me
and
I
can
let
my
nephew
,
the
captain
,
*NL*
occupy
it
.
I
began
to
worry
he
might
be
disturbing
you
when
I
had
to
*NL*
let
him
live
in
the
living
room
next
to
you
over
the
last
few
days
.
*NL*
He
's
not
very
considerate
.
''
``
What
an
idea
!
''
said
K.
standing
up
,
*NL*
``
there
's
no
question
of
that
.
You
seem
to
think
that
because
I
ca
n't
*NL*
stand
this
to-ing
and
fro-ing
of
Miss
Montag
that
I
'm
over-sensitive
-
*NL*
and
there
she
goes
back
again
.
''
Mrs.
Grubach
appeared
quite
powerless
.
*NL*
``
Should
I
tell
her
to
leave
moving
the
rest
of
her
things
over
till
*NL*
later
,
then
,
Mr.
K.
?
If
that
's
what
you
want
I
'll
do
it
immediately
.
''
*NL*
``
But
she
has
to
move
in
with
Miss
Buerstner
!
''
said
K.
``
Yes
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Grubach
,
without
quite
understanding
what
K.
meant
.
``
So
she
has
to
take
*NL*
her
things
over
there
.
''
Mrs.
Grubach
just
nodded
.
K.
was
irritated
all
*NL*
the
more
by
this
dumb
helplessness
which
,
seen
from
the
outside
,
could
*NL*
have
seemed
like
a
kind
of
defiance
on
her
part
.
He
began
to
walk
up
*NL*
and
down
the
room
between
the
window
and
the
door
,
thus
depriving
Mrs.
*NL*
Grubach
of
the
chance
to
leave
,
which
she
otherwise
probably
would
have
*NL*
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
K.
once
more
reached
the
door
,
someone
knocked
at
it
.
It
*NL*
was
the
maid
,
to
say
that
Miss
Montag
would
like
to
have
a
few
words
*NL*
with
Mr.
K.
,
and
therefore
requested
that
he
come
to
the
dining
room
*NL*
where
she
was
waiting
for
him
.
K.
heard
the
maid
out
thoughtfully
,
and
*NL*
then
looked
back
at
the
shocked
Mrs.
Grubach
in
a
way
that
was
almost
*NL*
contemptuous
.
His
look
seemed
to
be
saying
that
K.
had
been
expecting
*NL*
this
invitation
for
Miss
Montag
for
a
long
time
,
and
that
it
was
*NL*
confirmation
of
the
suffering
he
had
been
made
to
endure
that
Sunday
*NL*
morning
from
Mrs.
Grubach
's
tenants
.
He
sent
the
maid
back
with
the
*NL*
reply
that
he
was
on
his
way
,
then
he
went
to
the
wardrobe
to
change
his
*NL*
coat
,
and
in
answer
to
Mrs.
Grubach
's
gentle
whining
about
the
nuisance
*NL*
Miss
Montag
was
causing
merely
asked
her
to
clear
away
the
breakfast
*NL*
things
.
``
But
you
've
hardly
touched
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grubach
.
``
Oh
just
*NL*
take
it
away
!
''
shouted
K
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
Miss
Montag
was
mixed
*NL*
up
in
everything
and
made
it
repulsive
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
through
the
hallway
he
looked
at
the
closed
door
of
*NL*
Miss
Buerstner
's
room
.
But
it
was
n't
there
that
he
was
invited
,
but
the
*NL*
dining
room
,
to
which
he
yanked
the
door
open
without
knocking
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
long
but
narrow
with
one
window
.
There
was
only
*NL*
enough
space
available
to
put
two
cupboards
at
an
angle
in
the
corner
by
*NL*
the
door
,
and
the
rest
of
the
room
was
entirely
taken
up
with
the
long
*NL*
dining
table
which
started
by
the
door
and
reached
all
the
way
to
the
*NL*
great
window
,
which
was
thus
made
almost
inaccessible
.
The
table
was
*NL*
already
laid
for
a
large
number
of
people
,
as
on
Sundays
almost
all
the
*NL*
tenants
ate
their
dinner
here
at
midday
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
K.
entered
,
Miss
Montag
came
towards
him
from
the
window
*NL*
along
one
side
of
the
table
.
They
greeted
each
other
in
silence
.
Then
*NL*
Miss
Montag
,
her
head
unusually
erect
as
always
,
said
,
``
I
'm
not
sure
*NL*
whether
you
know
me
.
''
K.
looked
at
her
with
a
frown
.
``
Of
course
I
do
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
``
you
've
been
living
here
with
Mrs.
Grubach
for
quite
some
time
*NL*
now
.
''
``
But
I
get
the
impression
you
do
n't
pay
much
attention
to
what
's
*NL*
going
on
in
the
lodging
house
,
''
said
Miss
Montag
.
``
No
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
``
Would
you
not
like
to
sit
down
?
''
said
Miss
Montag
.
In
silence
,
the
two
*NL*
of
them
drew
chairs
out
from
the
farthest
end
of
the
table
and
sat
down
*NL*
facing
each
other
.
But
Miss
Montag
stood
straight
up
again
as
she
had
*NL*
left
her
handbag
on
the
window
sill
and
went
to
fetch
it
;
she
shuffled
*NL*
down
the
whole
length
of
the
room
.
When
she
came
back
,
the
handbag
*NL*
lightly
swinging
,
she
said
,
``
I
'd
like
just
to
have
a
few
words
with
you
*NL*
on
behalf
of
my
friend
.
She
would
have
come
herself
,
but
she
's
feeling
*NL*
a
little
unwell
today
.
Perhaps
you
'll
be
kind
enough
to
forgive
her
and
*NL*
listen
to
me
instead
.
There
's
anyway
nothing
that
she
could
have
said
*NL*
that
I
wo
n't
.
On
the
contrary
,
in
fact
,
I
think
I
can
say
even
more
*NL*
than
her
because
I
'm
relatively
impartial
.
Would
you
not
agree
?
''
``
What
*NL*
is
there
to
say
,
then
?
''
answered
K.
,
who
was
tired
of
Miss
Montag
*NL*
continuously
watching
his
lips
.
In
that
way
she
took
control
of
what
he
*NL*
wanted
to
say
before
he
said
it
.
``
Miss
Buerstner
clearly
refuses
to
*NL*
grant
me
the
personal
meeting
that
I
asked
her
for
.
''
``
That
's
how
it
*NL*
is
,
''
said
Miss
Montag
,
``
or
rather
,
that
's
not
at
all
how
it
is
,
the
way
*NL*
you
put
it
is
remarkably
severe
.
Generally
speaking
,
meetings
are
*NL*
neither
granted
nor
the
opposite
.
But
it
can
be
that
meetings
are
*NL*
considered
unnecessary
,
and
that
's
how
it
is
here
.
Now
,
after
your
*NL*
comment
,
I
can
speak
openly
.
You
asked
my
friend
,
verbally
or
in
*NL*
writing
,
for
the
chance
to
speak
with
her
.
Now
my
friend
is
aware
of
*NL*
your
reasons
for
asking
for
this
meeting
-
or
at
least
I
suppose
she
is
*NL*
-
and
so
,
for
reasons
I
know
nothing
about
,
she
is
quite
sure
that
it
*NL*
would
be
of
no
benefit
to
anyone
if
this
meeting
actually
took
place
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
it
was
only
yesterday
,
and
only
very
briefly
,
that
she
made
it
*NL*
clear
to
me
that
such
a
meeting
could
be
of
no
benefit
for
yourself
*NL*
either
,
she
feels
that
it
can
only
have
been
a
matter
of
chance
that
*NL*
such
an
idea
came
to
you
,
and
that
even
without
any
explanations
from
*NL*
her
,
you
will
very
soon
come
to
realise
yourself
,
if
you
have
not
done
*NL*
so
already
,
the
futility
of
your
idea
.
My
answer
to
that
is
that
*NL*
although
it
may
be
quite
right
,
I
consider
it
advantageous
,
if
the
*NL*
matter
is
to
be
made
perfectly
clear
,
to
give
you
an
explicit
answer
.
I
*NL*
offered
my
services
in
taking
on
the
task
,
and
after
some
hesitation
my
*NL*
friend
conceded
.
I
hope
,
however
,
also
to
have
acted
in
your
interests
,
*NL*
as
even
the
slightest
uncertainty
in
the
least
significant
of
matters
*NL*
will
always
remain
a
cause
of
suffering
and
if
,
as
in
this
case
,
it
can
*NL*
be
removed
without
substantial
effort
,
then
it
is
better
if
that
is
done
*NL*
without
delay
.
''
``
I
thank
you
,
''
said
K.
as
soon
as
Miss
Montag
had
*NL*
finished
.
He
stood
slowly
up
,
looked
at
her
,
then
across
the
table
,
*NL*
then
out
the
window
-
the
house
opposite
stood
there
in
the
sun
-
and
*NL*
went
to
the
door
.
Miss
Montag
followed
him
a
few
paces
,
as
if
she
did
*NL*
not
quite
trust
him
.
At
the
door
,
however
,
both
of
them
had
to
step
*NL*
back
as
it
opened
and
Captain
Lanz
entered
.
This
was
the
first
time
*NL*
that
K.
had
seen
him
close
up
.
He
was
a
large
man
of
about
forty
with
a
*NL*
tanned
,
fleshy
face
.
He
bowed
slightly
,
intending
it
also
for
K.
,
and
*NL*
then
went
over
to
Miss
Montag
and
deferentially
kissed
her
hand
.
He
was
*NL*
very
elegant
in
the
way
he
moved
.
The
courtesy
he
showed
towards
Miss
*NL*
Montag
made
a
striking
contrast
with
the
way
she
had
been
treated
by
K.
*NL*
Nonetheless
,
Miss
Montag
did
not
seem
to
be
cross
with
K.
as
it
even
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
she
wanted
to
introduce
the
captain
.
K.
however
,
did
*NL*
not
want
to
be
introduced
,
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
show
any
sort
*NL*
of
friendliness
either
to
Miss
Montag
or
to
the
captain
,
the
kiss
on
the
*NL*
hand
had
,
for
K.
,
bound
them
into
a
group
which
would
keep
him
at
a
*NL*
distance
from
Miss
Buerstner
whilst
at
the
same
time
seeming
to
be
*NL*
totally
harmless
and
unselfish
.
K.
thought
,
however
,
that
he
saw
more
*NL*
than
that
,
he
thought
he
also
saw
that
Miss
Montag
had
chosen
a
means
of
*NL*
doing
it
that
was
good
,
but
two-edged
.
She
exaggerated
the
importance
*NL*
of
the
relationship
between
K.
and
Miss
Buerstner
,
and
above
all
she
*NL*
exaggerated
the
importance
of
asking
to
speak
with
her
and
she
tried
at
*NL*
the
same
time
to
make
out
that
K.
was
exaggerating
everything
.
She
*NL*
would
be
disappointed
,
K.
did
not
want
to
exaggerate
anything
,
he
was
*NL*
aware
that
Miss
Buerstner
was
a
little
typist
who
would
not
offer
him
*NL*
much
resistance
for
long
.
In
doing
so
he
deliberately
took
no
account
*NL*
of
what
Mrs.
Grubach
had
told
him
about
Miss
Buerstner
.
All
these
things
*NL*
were
going
through
his
mind
as
he
left
the
room
with
hardly
a
polite
*NL*
word
.
He
wanted
to
go
straight
to
his
room
,
but
a
little
laugh
from
*NL*
Miss
Montag
that
he
heard
from
the
dining
room
behind
him
brought
him
to
*NL*
the
idea
that
he
might
prepare
a
surprise
for
the
two
of
them
,
the
*NL*
captain
and
Miss
Montag
.
He
looked
round
and
listened
to
find
out
if
*NL*
there
might
be
any
disturbance
from
any
of
the
surrounding
rooms
,
*NL*
everywhere
was
quiet
,
the
only
thing
to
be
heard
was
the
conversation
*NL*
from
the
dining
room
and
Mrs.
Grubach
's
voice
from
the
passage
leading
*NL*
to
the
kitchen
.
This
seemed
an
opportune
time
,
K.
went
to
Miss
*NL*
Buerstner
's
room
and
knocked
gently
.
There
was
no
sound
so
he
knocked
*NL*
again
but
there
was
still
no
answer
in
reply
.
Was
she
asleep
?
Or
was
*NL*
she
really
unwell
?
Or
was
she
just
pretending
as
she
realised
it
could
*NL*
only
be
K.
knocking
so
gently
?
K.
assumed
she
was
pretending
and
*NL*
knocked
harder
,
eventually
,
when
the
knocking
brought
no
result
,
he
*NL*
carefully
opened
the
door
with
the
sense
of
doing
something
that
was
not
*NL*
only
improper
but
also
pointless
.
In
the
room
there
was
no-one
.
What
's
*NL*
more
,
it
looked
hardly
at
all
like
the
room
K.
had
known
before
.
*NL*
Against
the
wall
there
were
now
two
beds
behind
one
another
,
there
were
*NL*
clothes
piled
up
on
three
chairs
near
the
door
,
a
wardrobe
stood
open
.
*NL*
Miss
Buerstner
must
have
gone
out
while
Miss
Montag
was
speaking
to
him
*NL*
in
the
dining
room
.
K.
was
not
greatly
bothered
by
this
,
he
had
hardly
*NL*
expected
to
be
able
to
find
Miss
Buerstner
so
easily
and
had
made
this
*NL*
attempt
for
little
more
reason
than
to
spite
Miss
Montag
.
But
that
made
*NL*
it
all
the
more
embarrassing
for
him
when
,
as
he
was
closing
the
door
*NL*
again
,
he
saw
Miss
Montag
and
the
captain
talking
in
the
open
doorway
of
*NL*
the
dining
room
.
They
had
probably
been
standing
there
ever
since
K.
*NL*
had
opened
the
door
,
they
avoided
seeming
to
observe
K.
but
chatted
*NL*
lightly
and
followed
his
movements
with
glances
,
the
absent
minded
*NL*
glances
to
the
side
such
as
you
make
during
a
conversation
.
But
these
*NL*
glances
were
heavy
for
K.
,
and
he
rushed
alongside
the
wall
back
into
*NL*
his
own
room
.

Chapter
Five
*NL*
The
whip-man
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
a
few
days
later
,
K.
was
walking
along
one
of
the
*NL*
corridors
that
separated
his
office
from
the
main
stairway
-
he
was
*NL*
nearly
the
last
one
to
leave
for
home
that
evening
,
there
remained
only
*NL*
a
couple
of
workers
in
the
light
of
a
single
bulb
in
the
dispatch
*NL*
department
-
when
he
heard
a
sigh
from
behind
a
door
which
he
had
*NL*
himself
never
opened
but
which
he
had
always
thought
just
led
into
a
*NL*
junk
room
.
He
stood
in
amazement
and
listened
again
to
establish
*NL*
whether
he
might
not
be
mistaken
.
For
a
while
there
was
silence
,
but
*NL*
then
came
some
more
sighs
.
His
first
thought
was
to
fetch
one
of
the
*NL*
servitors
,
it
might
well
have
been
worth
having
a
witness
present
,
but
*NL*
then
he
was
taken
by
an
uncontrollable
curiosity
that
make
him
simply
*NL*
yank
the
door
open
.
It
was
,
as
he
had
thought
,
a
junk
room
.
Old
,
*NL*
unusable
forms
,
empty
stone
ink-bottles
lay
scattered
behind
the
*NL*
entrance
.
But
in
the
cupboard-like
room
itself
stood
three
men
,
*NL*
crouching
under
the
low
ceiling
.
A
candle
fixed
on
a
shelf
gave
them
*NL*
light
.
``
What
are
you
doing
here
?
''
asked
K.
quietly
,
but
crossly
and
*NL*
without
thinking
.
One
of
the
men
was
clearly
in
charge
,
and
attracted
*NL*
attention
by
being
dressed
in
a
kind
of
dark
leather
costume
which
left
*NL*
his
neck
and
chest
and
his
arms
exposed
.
He
did
not
answer
.
But
the
*NL*
other
two
called
out
,
``
Mr.
K.
!
We
're
to
be
beaten
because
you
made
a
*NL*
complaint
about
us
to
the
examining
judge
.
''
And
now
,
K.
finally
*NL*
realised
that
it
was
actually
the
two
policemen
,
Franz
and
Willem
,
and
*NL*
that
the
third
man
held
a
cane
in
his
hand
with
which
to
beat
them
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
K.
,
staring
at
them
,
``
I
did
n't
make
any
complaint
,
I
only
*NL*
said
what
took
place
in
my
home
.
And
your
behaviour
was
not
entirely
*NL*
unobjectionable
,
after
all
.
''
``
Mr.
K.
,
''
said
Willem
,
while
Franz
clearly
*NL*
tried
to
shelter
behind
him
as
protection
from
the
third
man
,
``
if
you
*NL*
knew
how
badly
we
get
paid
you
would
n't
think
so
badly
of
us
.
I
've
got
*NL*
a
family
to
feed
,
and
Franz
here
wanted
to
get
married
,
you
just
have
to
*NL*
get
more
money
where
you
can
,
you
ca
n't
do
it
just
by
working
hard
,
not
*NL*
however
hard
you
try
.
I
was
sorely
tempted
by
your
fine
clothes
,
*NL*
policemen
are
n't
allowed
to
do
that
sort
of
thing
,
course
they
are
n't
,
*NL*
and
it
was
n't
right
of
us
,
but
it
's
tradition
that
the
clothes
go
to
the
*NL*
officers
,
that
's
how
it
's
always
been
,
believe
me
;
and
it
's
*NL*
understandable
too
,
is
n't
it
,
what
can
things
like
that
mean
for
anyone
*NL*
unlucky
enough
to
be
arrested
?
But
if
he
starts
talking
about
it
openly
*NL*
then
the
punishment
has
to
follow
.
''
``
I
did
n't
know
about
any
of
this
*NL*
that
you
've
been
telling
me
,
and
I
made
no
sort
of
request
that
you
be
*NL*
punished
,
I
was
simply
acting
on
principle
.
''
``
Franz
,
''
said
Willem
,
*NL*
turning
to
the
other
policeman
,
``
did
n't
I
tell
you
that
the
gentleman
*NL*
did
n't
say
he
wanted
us
to
be
punished
?
Now
you
can
hear
for
yourself
,
*NL*
he
did
n't
even
know
we
'd
have
to
be
punished
.
''
``
Do
n't
you
let
them
*NL*
persuade
you
,
talking
like
that
,
''
said
the
third
man
to
K.
,
``
this
*NL*
punishment
is
both
just
and
unavoidable
.
''
``
Do
n't
listen
to
him
,
''
said
*NL*
Willem
,
interrupting
himself
only
to
quickly
bring
his
hand
to
his
mouth
*NL*
when
it
had
received
a
stroke
of
the
cane
,
``
we
're
only
being
punished
*NL*
because
you
made
a
complaint
against
us
.
Nothing
would
have
happened
to
*NL*
us
otherwise
,
not
even
if
they
'd
found
out
what
we
'd
done
.
Can
you
call
*NL*
that
justice
?
Both
of
us
,
me
especially
,
we
'd
proved
our
worth
as
good
*NL*
police
officers
over
a
long
period
-
you
've
got
to
admit
yourself
that
*NL*
as
far
as
official
work
was
concerned
we
did
the
job
well
-
things
*NL*
looked
good
for
us
,
we
had
prospects
,
it
's
quite
certain
that
we
*NL*
would
've
been
made
whip-men
too
,
like
this
one
,
only
he
had
the
luck
not
*NL*
to
have
anyone
make
a
complaint
about
him
,
as
you
really
do
n't
get
many
*NL*
complaints
like
that
.
Only
that
's
all
finished
now
,
Mr.
K.
,
our
careers
*NL*
are
at
an
end
,
we
're
going
to
have
to
do
work
now
that
's
far
inferior
to
*NL*
police
work
and
besides
all
this
we
're
going
to
get
this
terrible
,
*NL*
painful
beating
.
''
``
Can
the
cane
really
cause
so
much
pain
,
then
?
''
asked
*NL*
K.
,
testing
the
cane
that
the
whip-man
swang
in
front
of
him
.
``
We
're
*NL*
going
to
have
to
strip
off
totally
naked
,
''
said
Willem
.
``
Oh
,
I
see
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
,
looking
straight
at
the
whip-man
,
his
skin
was
burned
brown
*NL*
like
a
sailor
's
,
and
his
face
showed
health
and
vigour
.
``
Is
there
*NL*
then
no
possibility
of
sparing
these
two
their
beating
?
''
he
asked
him
.
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
whip-man
,
shaking
his
head
with
a
laugh
.
``
Get
*NL*
undressed
!
''
he
ordered
the
policemen
.
And
to
K.
he
said
,
``
You
should
n't
*NL*
believe
everything
they
tell
you
,
it
's
the
fear
of
being
beaten
,
it
's
*NL*
already
made
them
a
bit
weak
in
the
head
.
This
one
here
,
for
instance
,
''
*NL*
he
pointed
at
Willem
,
``
all
that
he
told
you
about
his
career
prospects
,
*NL*
it
's
just
ridiculous
.
Look
at
him
,
look
how
fat
he
is
-
the
first
*NL*
strokes
of
the
cane
will
just
get
lost
in
all
that
fat
.
Do
you
know
*NL*
what
it
is
that
's
made
him
so
fat
?
He
's
in
the
habit
of
,
everyone
that
*NL*
gets
arrested
by
him
,
he
eats
their
breakfast
.
Did
n't
he
eat
up
your
*NL*
breakfast
?
Yeah
,
I
thought
as
much
.
But
a
man
with
a
belly
like
that
*NL*
ca
n't
be
made
into
a
whip-man
and
never
will
be
,
that
is
quite
out
of
*NL*
the
question
.
''
``
There
are
whip-men
like
that
,
''
Willem
insisted
,
who
had
*NL*
just
released
the
belt
of
this
trousers
.
``
No
,
''
said
the
whip-man
,
*NL*
striking
him
such
a
blow
with
the
cane
on
his
neck
that
it
made
him
*NL*
wince
,
``
you
should
n't
be
listening
to
this
,
just
get
undressed
.
''
``
I
*NL*
would
make
it
well
worth
your
while
if
you
would
let
them
go
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
and
without
looking
at
the
whip-man
again
-
as
such
matters
are
best
*NL*
carried
on
with
both
pairs
of
eyes
turned
down
-
he
pulled
out
his
*NL*
wallet
.
``
And
then
you
'd
try
and
put
in
a
complaint
against
me
,
too
,
''
*NL*
said
the
whip-man
,
``
and
get
me
flogged
.
No
,
no
!
''
``
Now
,
do
be
*NL*
reasonable
,
''
said
K.
,
``
if
I
had
wanted
to
get
these
two
punished
I
would
*NL*
not
now
be
trying
to
buy
their
freedom
,
would
I.
I
could
simply
close
*NL*
the
door
here
behind
me
,
go
home
and
see
or
hear
nothing
more
of
it
.
*NL*
But
that
's
not
what
I
'm
doing
,
it
really
is
of
much
more
importance
to
*NL*
me
to
let
them
go
free
;
if
I
had
realised
they
would
be
punished
,
or
*NL*
even
that
they
might
be
punished
,
I
would
never
have
named
them
in
the
*NL*
first
place
as
they
are
not
the
ones
I
hold
responsible
.
It
's
the
*NL*
organisation
that
's
to
blame
,
the
high
officials
are
the
ones
to
blame
.
''
*NL*
``
That
's
how
it
is
!
''
shouted
the
policemen
,
who
then
immediately
received
*NL*
another
blow
on
their
backs
,
which
were
by
now
exposed
.
``
If
you
had
a
*NL*
senior
judge
here
beneath
your
stick
,
''
said
K.
,
pressing
down
the
cane
*NL*
as
he
spoke
to
stop
it
being
raised
once
more
,
``
I
really
would
do
*NL*
nothing
to
stop
you
,
on
the
contrary
,
I
would
even
pay
you
money
to
give
*NL*
you
all
the
more
strength
.
''
``
Yeah
,
that
's
all
very
plausible
,
what
*NL*
you
're
saying
there
,
''
said
the
whip-man
,
``
only
I
'm
not
the
sort
of
*NL*
person
you
can
bribe
.
It
's
my
job
to
flog
people
,
so
I
flog
them
.
''
*NL*
Franz
,
the
policeman
,
had
been
fairly
quiet
so
far
,
probably
in
*NL*
expectation
of
a
good
result
from
K.
's
intervention
,
but
now
he
stepped
*NL*
forward
to
the
door
wearing
just
his
trousers
,
kneeled
down
hanging
on
*NL*
to
K.
's
arm
and
whispered
,
``
Even
if
you
ca
n't
get
mercy
shown
for
both
*NL*
of
us
,
at
least
try
and
get
me
set
free
.
Willem
is
older
than
me
,
he
's
*NL*
less
sensitive
than
me
in
every
way
,
he
even
got
a
light
beating
a
*NL*
couple
of
years
ago
,
but
my
record
's
still
clean
,
I
only
did
things
the
*NL*
way
I
did
because
Willem
led
me
on
to
it
,
he
's
been
my
teacher
both
for
*NL*
good
and
bad
.
Down
in
front
of
the
bank
my
poor
bride
is
waiting
for
me
*NL*
at
the
entrance
,
I
'm
so
ashamed
of
myself
,
it
's
pitiful
.
''
His
face
was
*NL*
flowing
over
with
tears
,
and
he
wiped
it
dry
on
K.
's
coat
.
``
I
'm
not
*NL*
going
to
wait
any
longer
,
''
said
the
whip-man
,
taking
hold
of
the
cane
in
*NL*
both
hands
and
laying
in
to
Franz
while
Willem
cowered
back
in
a
corner
*NL*
and
looked
on
secretly
,
not
even
daring
to
turn
his
head
.
Then
,
the
*NL*
sudden
scream
that
shot
out
from
Franz
was
long
and
irrevocable
,
it
*NL*
seemed
to
come
not
from
a
human
being
but
from
an
instrument
that
was
*NL*
being
tortured
,
the
whole
corridor
rang
with
it
,
it
must
have
been
heard
*NL*
by
everyone
in
the
building
.
``
Do
n't
shout
like
that
!
''
,
called
out
K.
,
*NL*
unable
to
prevent
himself
,
and
,
as
he
looked
anxiously
in
the
direction
*NL*
from
which
the
servitor
would
come
,
he
gave
Franz
a
shove
,
not
hard
,
but
*NL*
hard
enough
for
him
to
fall
down
unconscious
,
clawing
at
the
ground
with
*NL*
his
hands
by
reflex
;
he
still
did
not
avoid
being
hit
;
the
rod
still
*NL*
found
him
on
the
floor
;
the
tip
of
the
rod
swang
regularly
up
and
down
*NL*
while
he
rolled
to
and
fro
under
its
blows
.
And
now
one
of
the
*NL*
servitors
appeared
in
the
distance
,
with
another
a
few
steps
behind
him
.
*NL*
K.
had
quickly
thrown
the
door
shut
,
gone
over
to
one
of
the
windows
*NL*
overlooking
the
yard
and
opened
it
.
The
screams
had
completely
stopped
.
*NL*
So
that
the
servitor
would
n't
come
in
,
he
called
out
,
``
It
's
only
me
!
''
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
chief
clerk
,
''
somebody
called
back
.
``
Is
there
anything
*NL*
wrong
?
''
``
No
,
no
,
''
answered
K.
,
``
it
's
only
a
dog
yelping
in
the
yard
.
''
*NL*
There
was
no
sound
from
the
servitors
so
he
added
,
``
You
can
go
back
to
*NL*
what
you
were
doing
.
''
He
did
not
want
to
become
involved
with
a
*NL*
conversation
with
them
,
and
so
he
leant
out
of
the
window
.
A
little
*NL*
while
later
,
when
he
looked
out
in
the
corridor
,
they
had
already
gone
.
*NL*
Now
,
K.
remained
at
the
window
,
he
did
not
dare
go
back
into
the
junk
*NL*
room
,
and
he
did
not
want
to
go
home
either
.
The
yard
he
looked
down
*NL*
into
was
small
and
rectangular
,
all
around
it
were
offices
,
all
the
*NL*
windows
were
now
dark
and
only
those
at
the
very
top
caught
a
reflection
*NL*
of
the
moon
.
K
tried
hard
to
see
into
the
darkness
of
one
corner
of
the
*NL*
yard
,
where
a
few
handcarts
had
been
left
behind
one
another
.
He
felt
*NL*
anguish
at
not
having
been
able
to
prevent
the
flogging
,
but
that
was
*NL*
not
his
fault
,
if
Franz
had
not
screamed
like
that
-
clearly
it
must
*NL*
have
caused
a
great
deal
of
pain
but
it
's
important
to
maintain
control
*NL*
of
oneself
at
important
moments
-
if
Franz
had
not
screamed
then
it
was
*NL*
at
least
highly
probable
that
K.
would
have
been
able
to
dissuade
the
*NL*
whip-man
.
If
all
the
junior
officers
were
contemptible
why
would
the
*NL*
whip-man
,
whose
position
was
the
most
inhumane
of
all
,
be
any
exception
,
*NL*
and
K.
had
noticed
very
clearly
how
his
eyes
had
lit
up
when
he
saw
the
*NL*
banknotes
,
he
had
obviously
only
seemed
serious
about
the
flogging
to
*NL*
raise
the
level
of
the
bribe
a
little
.
And
K.
had
not
been
ungenerous
,
*NL*
he
really
had
wanted
to
get
the
policemen
freed
;
if
he
really
had
now
*NL*
begun
to
do
something
against
the
degeneracy
of
the
court
then
it
was
a
*NL*
matter
of
course
that
he
would
have
to
do
something
here
as
well
.
But
*NL*
of
course
,
it
became
impossible
for
him
to
do
anything
as
soon
as
Franz
*NL*
started
screaming
.
K.
could
not
possibly
have
let
the
junior
bank
*NL*
staff
,
and
perhaps
even
all
sorts
of
other
people
,
come
along
and
catch
*NL*
him
by
surprise
as
he
haggled
with
those
people
in
the
junk
room
.
*NL*
Nobody
could
really
expect
that
sort
of
sacrifice
of
him
.
If
that
had
*NL*
been
his
intention
then
it
would
almost
have
been
easier
,
K.
would
have
*NL*
taken
his
own
clothes
off
and
offered
himself
to
the
whip-man
in
the
*NL*
policemen
's
place
.
The
whip-man
would
certainly
not
have
accepted
this
*NL*
substitution
anyway
,
as
in
that
way
he
would
have
seriously
violated
his
*NL*
duty
without
gaining
any
benefit
.
He
would
most
likely
have
violated
*NL*
his
duty
twice
over
,
as
court
employees
were
probably
under
orders
not
*NL*
to
cause
any
harm
to
K.
while
he
was
facing
charges
,
although
there
may
*NL*
have
been
special
conditions
in
force
here
.
However
things
stood
,
K.
*NL*
was
able
to
do
no
more
than
throw
the
door
shut
,
even
though
that
would
*NL*
still
do
nothing
to
remove
all
the
dangers
he
faced
.
It
was
regrettable
*NL*
that
he
had
given
Franz
a
shove
,
and
it
could
only
be
excused
by
the
*NL*
heat
of
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
distance
,
he
heard
the
steps
of
the
servitors
;
he
did
not
*NL*
want
them
to
be
too
aware
of
his
presence
,
so
he
closed
the
window
and
*NL*
walked
towards
the
main
staircase
.
At
the
door
of
the
junk
room
he
*NL*
stopped
and
listened
for
a
little
while
.
All
was
silent
.
The
two
*NL*
policemen
were
entirely
at
the
whip-man
's
mercy
;
he
could
have
beaten
*NL*
them
to
death
.
K.
reached
his
hand
out
for
the
door
handle
but
drew
it
*NL*
suddenly
back
.
He
was
no
longer
in
any
position
to
help
anyone
,
and
the
*NL*
servitors
would
soon
be
back
;
he
did
,
though
,
promise
himself
that
he
*NL*
would
raise
the
matter
again
with
somebody
and
see
that
,
as
far
as
it
*NL*
was
in
his
power
,
those
who
really
were
guilty
,
the
high
officials
whom
*NL*
nobody
had
so
far
dared
point
out
to
him
,
received
their
due
punishment
.
*NL*
As
he
went
down
the
main
stairway
at
the
front
of
the
bank
,
he
looked
*NL*
carefully
round
at
everyone
who
was
passing
,
but
there
was
no
girl
to
be
*NL*
seen
who
might
have
been
waiting
for
somebody
,
not
even
within
some
*NL*
distance
from
the
bank
.
Franz
's
claim
that
his
bride
was
waiting
for
*NL*
him
was
thus
shown
to
be
a
lie
,
albeit
one
that
was
forgivable
and
*NL*
intended
only
to
elicit
more
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
policemen
were
still
on
K.
's
mind
all
through
the
following
*NL*
day
;
he
was
unable
to
concentrate
on
his
work
and
had
to
stay
in
his
*NL*
office
a
little
longer
than
the
previous
day
so
that
he
could
finish
it
.
*NL*
On
the
way
home
,
as
he
passed
by
the
junk
room
again
,
he
opened
its
door
*NL*
as
if
that
had
been
his
habit
.
Instead
of
the
darkness
he
expected
,
he
*NL*
saw
everything
unchanged
from
the
previous
evening
,
and
did
not
know
how
*NL*
he
should
respond
.
Everything
was
exactly
the
same
as
he
had
seen
it
*NL*
when
he
had
opened
the
door
the
previous
evening
.
The
forms
and
*NL*
bottles
of
ink
just
inside
the
doorway
,
the
whip-man
with
his
cane
,
the
*NL*
two
policemen
,
still
undressed
,
the
candle
on
the
shelf
,
and
the
two
*NL*
policemen
began
to
wail
and
call
out
``
Mr.
K.
!
''
K.
slammed
the
door
*NL*
immediately
shut
,
and
even
thumped
on
it
with
his
fists
as
if
that
would
*NL*
shut
it
all
the
firmer
.
Almost
in
tears
,
he
ran
to
the
servitors
*NL*
working
quietly
at
the
copying
machine
.
``
Go
and
get
that
junk
room
*NL*
cleared
out
!
''
he
shouted
,
and
,
in
amazement
,
they
stopped
what
they
were
*NL*
doing
.
``
It
should
have
been
done
long
ago
,
we
're
sinking
in
dirt
!
''
They
*NL*
would
be
able
to
do
the
job
the
next
day
,
K.
nodded
,
it
was
too
late
in
*NL*
the
evening
to
make
them
do
it
there
and
then
as
he
had
originally
*NL*
intended
.
He
sat
down
briefly
in
order
to
keep
them
near
him
for
a
*NL*
little
longer
,
looked
through
a
few
of
the
copies
to
give
the
impression
*NL*
that
he
was
checking
them
and
then
,
as
he
saw
that
they
would
not
dare
*NL*
to
leave
at
the
same
time
as
himself
,
went
home
tired
and
with
his
mind
*NL*
numb
.

Chapter
Six
*NL*
K.
's
uncle
-
Leni
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
-
K.
was
very
busy
at
the
time
,
getting
the
post
*NL*
ready
-
K.
's
Uncle
Karl
,
a
small
country
land
owner
,
came
into
the
room
,
*NL*
pushing
his
way
between
two
of
the
staff
who
were
bringing
in
some
*NL*
papers
.
K.
had
long
expected
his
uncle
to
appear
,
but
the
sight
of
him
*NL*
now
shocked
K.
far
less
than
the
prospect
of
it
had
done
a
long
time
*NL*
before
.
His
uncle
was
bound
to
come
,
K.
had
been
sure
of
that
for
about
*NL*
a
month
.
He
already
thought
at
the
time
he
could
see
how
his
uncle
*NL*
would
arrive
,
slightly
bowed
,
his
battered
panama
hat
in
his
left
hand
,
*NL*
his
right
hand
already
stretched
out
over
the
desk
long
before
he
was
*NL*
close
enough
as
he
rushed
carelessly
towards
K.
knocking
over
everything
*NL*
that
was
in
his
way
.
K.
's
uncle
was
always
in
a
hurry
,
as
he
suffered
*NL*
from
the
unfortunate
belief
that
he
had
a
number
things
to
do
while
he
*NL*
was
in
the
big
city
and
had
to
settle
all
of
them
in
one
day
-
his
*NL*
visits
were
only
ever
for
one
day
-
and
at
the
same
time
thought
he
*NL*
could
not
forgo
any
conversation
or
piece
of
business
or
pleasure
that
*NL*
might
arise
by
chance
.
Uncle
Karl
was
K.
's
former
guardian
,
and
so
K.
*NL*
was
duty-bound
to
help
him
in
all
of
this
as
well
as
to
offer
him
a
bed
*NL*
for
the
night
.
`
I
'm
haunted
by
a
ghost
from
the
country
'
,
he
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
had
greeted
each
other
-
K.
had
invited
him
to
sit
*NL*
in
the
armchair
but
Uncle
Karl
had
no
time
for
that
-
he
said
he
wanted
*NL*
to
speak
briefly
with
K.
in
private
.
``
It
is
necessary
,
''
he
said
with
a
*NL*
tired
gulp
,
``
it
is
necessary
for
my
peace
of
mind
.
''
K.
immediately
*NL*
sent
the
junior
staff
from
the
room
and
told
them
to
let
no-one
in
.
*NL*
``
What
's
this
that
I
've
been
hearing
,
Josef
?
''
cried
K.
's
uncle
when
they
*NL*
were
alone
,
as
he
sat
on
the
table
shoving
various
papers
under
himself
*NL*
without
looking
at
them
to
make
himself
more
comfortable
.
K.
said
*NL*
nothing
,
he
knew
what
was
coming
,
but
,
suddenly
relieved
from
the
effort
*NL*
of
the
work
he
had
been
doing
,
he
gave
way
to
a
pleasant
lassitude
and
*NL*
looked
out
the
window
at
the
other
side
of
the
street
.
From
where
he
*NL*
sat
,
he
could
see
just
a
small
,
triangular
section
of
it
,
part
of
the
*NL*
empty
walls
of
houses
between
two
shop
windows
.
``
You
're
staring
out
the
*NL*
window
!
''
called
out
his
uncle
,
raising
his
arms
,
``
For
God
's
sake
,
Josef
,
*NL*
give
me
an
answer
!
Is
it
true
,
can
it
really
be
true
?
''
``
Uncle
Karl
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
,
wrenching
himself
back
from
his
daydreaming
,
``
I
really
do
n't
*NL*
know
what
it
is
you
want
of
me
.
''
``
Josef
,
''
said
his
uncle
in
a
warning
*NL*
tone
,
``
as
far
as
I
know
,
you
've
always
told
the
truth
.
Am
I
to
take
*NL*
what
you
've
just
said
as
a
bad
sign
?
''
``
I
think
I
know
what
it
is
you
*NL*
want
,
''
said
K.
obediently
,
``
I
expect
you
've
heard
about
my
trial
.
''
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
''
answered
his
uncle
with
a
slow
nod
,
``
I
've
heard
about
*NL*
your
trial
.
''
``
Who
did
you
hear
it
from
,
then
?
''
asked
K.
``
Erna
wrote
to
*NL*
me
,
''
said
his
uncle
,
``
she
does
n't
have
much
contact
with
you
,
it
's
true
,
*NL*
you
do
n't
pay
very
much
attention
to
her
,
I
'm
afraid
to
say
,
but
she
*NL*
learned
about
it
nonetheless
.
I
got
her
letter
today
and
,
of
course
,
I
*NL*
came
straight
here
.
And
for
no
other
reason
,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
*NL*
this
is
reason
enough
.
I
can
read
you
out
the
part
of
the
letter
that
*NL*
concerns
you
.
''
He
drew
the
letter
out
from
his
wallet
.
``
Here
it
is
.
*NL*
She
writes
;
'
I
have
not
seen
Josef
for
a
long
time
,
I
was
in
the
bank
*NL*
last
week
but
Josef
was
so
busy
that
they
would
not
let
me
through
;
I
*NL*
waited
there
for
nearly
an
hour
but
then
I
had
to
go
home
as
I
had
my
*NL*
piano
lesson
.
I
would
have
liked
to
have
spoken
to
him
,
maybe
there
*NL*
will
be
a
chance
another
time
.
He
sent
me
a
big
box
of
chocolates
for
*NL*
my
name-day
,
that
was
very
nice
and
attentive
of
him
.
I
forgot
to
tell
*NL*
you
about
it
when
I
wrote
,
and
I
only
remember
now
that
you
ask
me
about
*NL*
it
.
Chocolate
,
as
I
am
sure
you
are
aware
,
disappears
straight
away
in
*NL*
this
lodging
house
,
almost
as
soon
as
you
know
somebody
has
given
you
*NL*
chocolate
it
is
gone
.
But
there
is
something
else
I
wanted
to
tell
you
*NL*
about
Josef
.
Like
I
said
,
they
would
not
let
me
through
to
see
him
at
*NL*
the
bank
because
he
was
negotiating
with
some
gentleman
just
then
.
*NL*
After
I
had
been
waiting
quietly
for
quite
a
long
time
I
asked
one
of
*NL*
the
staff
whether
his
meeting
would
last
much
longer
.
He
said
it
might
*NL*
well
do
,
as
it
was
probably
about
the
legal
proceedings
,
he
said
,
that
*NL*
were
being
conducted
against
him
.
I
asked
what
sort
of
legal
*NL*
proceedings
it
was
that
were
being
conducted
against
the
chief
clerk
,
*NL*
and
whether
he
was
not
making
some
mistake
,
but
he
said
he
was
not
*NL*
making
any
mistake
,
there
were
legal
proceedings
underway
and
even
that
*NL*
they
were
about
something
quite
serious
,
but
he
did
not
know
any
more
*NL*
about
it
.
He
would
have
liked
to
have
been
of
some
help
to
the
chief
*NL*
clerk
himself
,
as
the
chief
clerk
was
a
gentleman
,
good
and
honest
,
but
*NL*
he
did
not
know
what
it
was
he
could
do
and
merely
hoped
there
would
be
*NL*
some
influential
gentlemen
who
would
take
his
side
.
I
'm
sure
that
is
*NL*
what
will
happen
and
that
everything
will
turn
out
for
the
best
in
the
*NL*
end
,
but
in
the
mean
time
things
do
not
look
at
all
good
,
and
you
can
*NL*
see
that
from
the
mood
of
the
chief
clerk
himself
.
Of
course
,
I
did
not
*NL*
place
too
much
importance
on
this
conversation
,
and
even
did
my
best
to
*NL*
put
the
bank
clerk
's
mind
at
rest
,
he
was
quite
a
simple
man
.
I
told
*NL*
him
he
was
not
to
speak
to
anyone
else
about
this
,
and
I
think
it
is
all
*NL*
just
a
rumour
,
but
I
still
think
it
might
be
good
if
you
,
Dear
Father
,
*NL*
if
you
looked
into
the
matter
the
next
time
you
visit
.
It
will
be
easy
*NL*
for
you
to
find
out
more
detail
and
,
if
it
is
really
necessary
,
to
do
*NL*
something
about
it
through
the
great
and
influential
people
you
know
.
*NL*
But
if
it
is
not
necessary
,
and
that
is
what
seems
most
likely
,
then
at
*NL*
least
your
daughter
will
soon
have
the
chance
to
embrace
you
and
I
look
*NL*
forward
to
it
.
'
-
She
's
a
good
child
,
''
said
K.
's
uncle
when
he
had
*NL*
finished
reading
,
and
wiped
a
few
tears
from
his
eyes
.
K.
nodded
.
With
*NL*
all
the
different
disruptions
he
had
had
recently
he
had
completely
*NL*
forgotten
about
Erna
,
even
her
birthday
,
and
the
story
of
the
chocolates
*NL*
had
clearly
just
been
invented
so
that
he
would
n't
get
in
trouble
with
*NL*
his
aunt
and
uncle
.
It
was
very
touching
,
and
even
the
theatre
tickets
,
*NL*
which
he
would
regularly
send
her
from
then
on
,
would
not
be
enough
to
*NL*
repay
her
,
but
he
really
did
not
feel
,
now
,
that
it
was
right
for
him
*NL*
to
visit
her
in
her
lodgings
and
hold
conversations
with
a
little
,
*NL*
eighteen
year
old
schoolgirl
.
``
And
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
that
?
''
*NL*
asked
his
uncle
,
who
had
forgotten
all
his
rush
and
excitement
as
he
read
*NL*
the
letter
,
and
seemed
to
be
about
to
read
it
again
.
``
Yes
,
Uncle
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
,
``
it
is
true
.
''
``
True
!
''
called
out
his
uncle
.
``
What
is
true
?
How
can
*NL*
this
be
true
?
What
sort
of
trial
is
it
?
Not
a
criminal
trial
,
I
hope
?
''
*NL*
``
It
's
a
criminal
trial
,
''
answered
K.
``
And
you
sit
quietly
here
while
*NL*
you
've
got
a
criminal
trial
round
your
neck
?
''
shouted
his
uncle
,
getting
*NL*
ever
louder
.
``
The
more
calm
I
am
,
the
better
it
will
be
for
the
*NL*
outcome
,
''
said
K.
in
a
tired
voice
,
``
do
n't
worry
.
''
``
How
can
I
help
*NL*
worrying
?!
''
shouted
his
uncle
,
``
Josef
,
my
Dear
Josef
,
think
about
*NL*
yourself
,
about
your
family
,
think
about
our
good
name
!
Up
till
now
,
*NL*
you
've
always
been
our
pride
,
do
n't
now
become
our
disgrace
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
like
the
way
you
're
behaving
,
''
he
said
,
looking
at
K.
with
his
head
at
*NL*
an
angle
,
``
that
's
not
how
an
innocent
man
behaves
when
he
's
accused
of
*NL*
something
,
not
if
he
's
still
got
any
strength
in
him
.
Just
tell
me
what
*NL*
it
's
all
about
so
that
I
can
help
you
.
It
's
something
to
do
with
the
*NL*
bank
,
I
take
it
?
''
``
No
,
''
said
K.
as
he
stood
up
,
``
and
you
're
speaking
*NL*
too
loud
,
Uncle
,
I
expect
one
of
the
staff
is
listening
at
the
door
and
*NL*
I
find
that
rather
unpleasant
.
It
's
best
if
we
go
somewhere
else
,
then
*NL*
I
can
answer
all
your
questions
,
as
far
as
I
can
.
And
I
know
very
well
*NL*
that
I
have
to
account
to
the
family
for
what
I
do
.
''
``
You
certainly
*NL*
do
!
''
his
uncle
shouted
,
``
Quite
right
,
you
do
.
Now
just
get
a
move
on
,
*NL*
Josef
,
hurry
up
now
!
''
``
I
still
have
a
few
documents
I
need
to
prepare
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
,
and
,
using
the
intercom
,
he
summoned
his
deputy
who
entered
a
*NL*
few
moments
later
.
K.
's
uncle
,
still
angry
and
excited
,
gestured
with
*NL*
his
hand
to
show
that
K.
had
summoned
him
,
even
though
there
was
no
need
*NL*
whatever
to
do
so
.
K.
stood
in
front
of
the
desk
and
explained
to
the
*NL*
young
man
,
who
listened
calm
and
attentive
,
what
would
need
to
be
done
*NL*
that
day
in
his
absence
,
speaking
in
a
calm
voice
and
making
use
of
*NL*
various
documents
.
The
presence
of
K.
's
uncle
while
this
was
going
on
*NL*
was
quite
disturbing
;
he
did
not
listen
to
what
was
being
said
,
but
at
*NL*
first
he
stood
there
with
eyes
wide
open
and
nervously
biting
his
lips
.
*NL*
Then
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
,
stopped
now
and
then
at
the
*NL*
window
,
or
stood
in
front
of
a
picture
always
making
various
*NL*
exclamations
such
as
,
``
That
is
totally
incomprehensible
to
me
!
''
or
``
Now
*NL*
just
tell
me
,
what
are
you
supposed
to
make
of
that
?!
''
The
young
man
*NL*
pretended
to
notice
nothing
of
this
and
listened
to
K.
's
instructions
*NL*
through
to
the
end
,
he
made
a
few
notes
,
bowed
to
both
K.
and
his
uncle
*NL*
and
then
left
the
room
.
K.
's
uncle
had
turned
his
back
to
him
and
was
*NL*
looking
out
the
window
,
bunching
up
the
curtains
with
his
outstretched
*NL*
hands
.
The
door
had
hardly
closed
when
he
called
out
,
``
At
last
!
Now
*NL*
that
he
's
stopped
jumping
about
we
can
go
too
!
''
Once
they
were
in
the
*NL*
front
hall
of
the
bank
,
where
several
members
of
staff
were
standing
*NL*
about
and
where
,
just
then
,
the
deputy
director
was
walking
across
,
*NL*
there
was
unfortunately
no
way
of
stopping
K.
's
uncle
from
continually
*NL*
asking
questions
about
the
trial
.
``
Now
then
,
Josef
,
''
he
began
,
lightly
*NL*
acknowledging
the
bows
from
those
around
them
as
they
passed
,
``
tell
me
*NL*
everything
about
this
trial
;
what
sort
of
trial
is
it
?
''
K.
made
a
few
*NL*
comments
which
conveyed
little
information
,
even
laughed
a
little
,
and
*NL*
it
was
only
when
they
reached
the
front
steps
that
he
explained
to
his
*NL*
uncle
that
he
had
not
wanted
to
talk
openly
in
front
of
those
people
.
*NL*
``
Quite
right
,
''
said
his
uncle
,
``
but
now
start
talking
.
''
With
his
head
*NL*
to
one
side
,
and
smoking
his
cigar
in
short
,
impatient
draughts
,
he
*NL*
listened
.
``
First
of
all
,
Uncle
,
''
said
K.
,
``
it
's
not
a
trial
like
you
'd
*NL*
have
in
a
normal
courtroom
.
''
``
So
much
the
worse
,
''
said
his
uncle
.
*NL*
``
How
's
that
?
''
asked
K.
,
looking
at
him
.
``
What
I
mean
is
,
that
's
for
the
*NL*
worse
,
''
he
repeated
.
They
were
standing
on
the
front
steps
of
the
bank
;
*NL*
as
the
doorkeeper
seemed
to
be
listening
to
what
they
were
saying
K.
*NL*
drew
his
uncle
down
further
,
where
they
were
absorbed
into
the
bustle
of
*NL*
the
street
.
His
uncle
took
K.
's
arm
and
stopped
asking
questions
with
*NL*
such
urgency
about
the
trial
,
they
walked
on
for
a
while
in
silence
.
*NL*
``
But
how
did
all
this
come
about
?
''
he
eventually
asked
,
stopping
*NL*
abruptly
enough
to
startle
the
people
walking
behind
,
who
had
to
avoid
*NL*
walking
into
him
.
``
Things
like
this
do
n't
come
all
of
a
sudden
,
they
*NL*
start
developing
a
long
time
beforehand
,
there
must
have
been
warning
*NL*
signs
of
it
,
why
did
n't
you
write
to
me
?
You
know
I
'd
do
anything
for
*NL*
you
,
to
some
extent
I
am
still
your
guardian
,
and
until
today
that
's
*NL*
something
I
was
proud
of
.
I
'll
still
help
you
,
of
course
I
will
,
only
*NL*
now
,
now
that
the
trial
is
already
underway
,
it
makes
it
very
difficult
.
*NL*
But
whatever
;
the
best
thing
now
is
for
you
to
take
a
short
holiday
*NL*
staying
with
us
in
the
country
.
You
've
lost
weight
,
I
can
see
that
now
.
*NL*
The
country
life
will
give
you
strength
,
that
will
be
good
,
there
's
*NL*
bound
to
be
a
lot
of
hard
work
ahead
of
you
.
But
besides
that
it
'll
be
*NL*
a
way
of
getting
you
away
from
the
court
,
to
some
extent
.
Here
they
've
*NL*
got
every
means
of
showing
the
powers
at
their
disposal
and
they
're
*NL*
automatically
bound
to
use
them
against
you
;
in
the
country
they
'll
*NL*
either
have
to
delegate
authority
to
different
bodies
or
just
have
to
*NL*
try
and
bother
you
by
letter
,
telegram
or
telephone
.
And
that
's
bound
*NL*
to
weaken
the
effect
,
it
wo
n't
release
you
from
them
but
it
'll
give
you
*NL*
room
to
breathe
.
''
``
You
could
forbid
me
to
leave
,
''
said
K.
,
who
had
been
*NL*
drawn
slightly
into
his
uncle
's
way
of
thinking
by
what
he
had
been
*NL*
saying
.
``
I
did
n't
think
you
would
do
it
,
''
said
his
uncle
thoughtfully
,
*NL*
``
you
wo
n't
suffer
too
much
loss
of
power
by
moving
away
.
''
K.
grasped
*NL*
his
uncle
under
the
arm
to
prevent
him
stopping
still
and
said
,
``
I
*NL*
thought
you
'd
think
all
this
is
less
important
than
I
do
,
and
now
you
're
*NL*
taking
it
so
hard
.
''
``
Josef
,
''
called
his
uncle
trying
to
disentangle
*NL*
himself
from
him
so
that
he
could
stop
walking
,
but
K.
did
not
let
go
,
*NL*
``
you
've
completely
changed
,
you
used
to
be
so
astute
,
are
you
losing
it
*NL*
now
?
Do
you
want
to
lose
the
trial
?
Do
you
realise
what
that
would
*NL*
mean
?
That
would
mean
you
would
be
simply
destroyed
.
And
that
everyone
*NL*
you
know
would
be
pulled
down
with
you
or
at
the
very
least
humiliated
,
*NL*
disgraced
right
down
to
the
ground
.
Josef
,
pull
yourself
together
.
The
*NL*
way
you
're
so
indifferent
about
it
,
it
's
driving
me
mad
.
Looking
at
you
*NL*
I
can
almost
believe
that
old
saying
:
`
Having
a
trial
like
that
means
*NL*
losing
a
trial
like
that
'
.
''
``
My
dear
Uncle
,
''
said
K.
,
``
it
wo
n't
do
any
*NL*
good
to
get
excited
,
it
's
no
good
for
you
to
do
it
and
it
'd
be
no
good
*NL*
for
me
to
do
it
.
The
case
wo
n't
be
won
by
getting
excited
,
and
please
*NL*
admit
that
my
practical
experience
counts
for
something
,
just
as
I
have
*NL*
always
and
still
do
respect
your
experience
,
even
when
it
surprises
me
.
*NL*
You
say
that
the
family
will
also
be
affected
by
this
trial
;
I
really
*NL*
ca
n't
see
how
,
but
that
's
beside
the
point
and
I
'm
quite
willing
to
*NL*
follow
your
instructions
in
all
of
this
.
Only
,
I
do
n't
see
any
*NL*
advantage
in
staying
in
the
country
,
not
even
for
you
,
as
that
would
*NL*
indicate
flight
and
a
sense
of
guilt
.
And
besides
,
although
I
am
more
*NL*
subject
to
persecution
if
I
stay
in
the
city
I
can
also
press
the
matter
*NL*
forward
better
here
.
''
``
You
're
right
,
''
said
his
uncle
in
a
tone
that
*NL*
seemed
to
indicate
they
were
finally
coming
closer
to
each
other
,
``
I
*NL*
just
made
the
suggestion
because
,
as
I
saw
it
,
if
you
stay
in
the
city
*NL*
the
case
will
be
put
in
danger
by
your
indifference
to
it
,
and
I
thought
*NL*
it
was
better
if
I
did
the
work
for
you
.
But
will
you
push
things
*NL*
forward
yourself
with
all
your
strength
,
if
so
,
that
will
naturally
be
*NL*
far
better
.
''
``
We
're
agreed
then
,
''
said
K.
``
And
do
you
have
any
*NL*
suggestions
for
what
I
should
do
next
?
''
``
Well
,
naturally
I
'll
have
to
*NL*
think
about
it
,
''
said
his
uncle
,
``
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
I
've
been
*NL*
living
in
the
country
for
twenty
years
now
,
almost
without
a
break
,
you
*NL*
lose
your
ability
to
deal
with
matters
like
this
.
But
I
do
have
some
*NL*
important
connections
with
several
people
who
,
I
expect
,
know
their
way
*NL*
around
these
things
better
than
I
do
,
and
to
contact
them
is
a
matter
of
*NL*
course
.
Out
there
in
the
country
I
've
been
getting
out
of
condition
,
*NL*
I
'm
sure
you
're
already
aware
of
that
.
It
's
only
at
times
like
this
*NL*
that
you
notice
it
yourself
.
And
this
affair
of
yours
came
largely
*NL*
unexpected
,
although
,
oddly
enough
,
I
had
expected
something
of
the
sort
*NL*
after
I
'd
read
Erna
's
letter
,
and
today
when
I
saw
your
face
I
knew
it
*NL*
with
almost
total
certainty
.
But
all
that
is
by
the
by
,
the
important
*NL*
thing
now
is
,
we
have
no
time
to
lose
.
''
Even
while
he
was
still
*NL*
speaking
,
K.
's
uncle
had
stood
on
tiptoe
to
summon
a
taxi
and
now
he
*NL*
pulled
K.
into
the
car
behind
himself
as
he
called
out
an
address
to
the
*NL*
driver
.
``
We
're
going
now
to
see
Dr.
Huld
,
the
lawyer
,
''
he
said
,
``
we
*NL*
were
at
school
together
.
I
'm
sure
you
know
the
name
,
do
n't
you
?
No
?
*NL*
Well
that
is
odd
.
He
's
got
a
very
good
reputation
as
a
defence
*NL*
barrister
and
for
working
with
the
poor
.
But
I
esteem
him
especially
as
*NL*
someone
you
can
trust
.
''
``
It
's
alright
with
me
,
whatever
you
do
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
,
although
he
was
made
uneasy
by
the
rushed
and
urgent
way
his
uncle
*NL*
was
dealing
with
the
matter
.
It
was
not
very
encouraging
,
as
the
*NL*
accused
,
be
to
taken
to
a
lawyer
for
poor
people
.
``
I
did
n't
know
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
that
you
could
take
on
a
lawyer
in
matters
like
this
.
''
``
Well
of
*NL*
course
you
can
,
''
said
his
uncle
,
``
that
goes
without
saying
.
Why
*NL*
would
n't
you
take
on
a
lawyer
?
And
now
,
so
that
I
'm
properly
instructed
*NL*
in
this
matter
,
tell
me
what
's
been
happening
so
far
.
''
K.
instantly
*NL*
began
telling
his
uncle
about
what
had
been
happening
,
holding
nothing
*NL*
back
-
being
completely
open
with
him
was
the
only
way
that
K.
could
*NL*
protest
at
his
uncle
's
belief
that
the
trial
was
a
great
disgrace
.
He
*NL*
mentioned
Miss
Buerstner
's
name
just
once
and
in
passing
,
but
that
did
*NL*
nothing
to
diminish
his
openness
about
the
trial
as
Miss
Buerstner
had
no
*NL*
connection
with
it
.
As
he
spoke
,
he
looked
out
the
window
and
saw
how
,
*NL*
just
then
,
they
were
getting
closer
to
the
suburb
where
the
court
*NL*
offices
were
.
He
drew
this
to
his
uncle
's
attention
,
but
he
did
not
*NL*
find
the
coincidence
especially
remarkable
.
The
taxi
stopped
in
front
*NL*
of
a
dark
building
.
K.
's
uncle
knocked
at
the
very
first
door
at
ground
*NL*
level
;
while
they
waited
he
smiled
,
showing
his
big
teeth
,
and
*NL*
whispered
,
``
Eight
o'clock
;
not
the
usual
sort
of
time
to
be
visiting
a
*NL*
lawyer
,
but
Huld
wo
n't
mind
it
from
me
.
''
Two
large
,
black
eyes
appeared
*NL*
in
the
spy-hatch
in
the
door
,
they
stared
at
the
two
visitors
for
a
*NL*
while
and
then
disappeared
;
the
door
,
however
,
did
not
open
.
K.
and
his
*NL*
uncle
confirmed
to
each
other
the
fact
that
they
had
seen
the
two
eyes
.
*NL*
``
A
new
maid
,
afraid
of
strangers
,
''
said
K.
's
uncle
,
and
knocked
again
.
*NL*
The
eyes
appeared
once
more
.
This
time
they
seemed
almost
sad
,
but
the
*NL*
open
gas
flame
that
burned
with
a
hiss
close
above
their
heads
gave
off
*NL*
little
light
and
that
may
have
merely
created
an
illusion
.
``
Open
the
*NL*
door
,
''
called
K.
's
uncle
,
raising
his
fist
against
it
,
``
we
are
friends
*NL*
of
Dr.
Huld
,
the
lawyer
!
''
``
Dr.
Huld
is
ill
,
''
whispered
someone
behind
*NL*
them
.
In
a
doorway
at
the
far
end
of
a
narrow
passage
stood
a
man
in
*NL*
his
dressing
gown
,
giving
them
this
information
in
an
extremely
quiet
*NL*
voice
.
K.
's
uncle
,
who
had
already
been
made
very
angry
by
the
long
*NL*
wait
,
turned
abruptly
round
and
retorted
,
``
Ill
?
You
say
he
's
ill
?
''
and
*NL*
strode
towards
the
gentleman
in
a
way
that
seemed
almost
threatening
,
as
*NL*
if
he
were
the
illness
himself
.
``
They
've
opened
the
door
for
you
,
now
,
''
*NL*
said
the
gentleman
,
pointing
at
the
door
of
the
lawyer
.
He
pulled
his
*NL*
dressing
gown
together
and
disappeared
.
The
door
had
indeed
been
*NL*
opened
,
a
young
girl
-
K.
recognised
the
dark
,
slightly
bulging
eyes
-
*NL*
stood
in
the
hallway
in
a
long
white
apron
,
holding
a
candle
in
her
*NL*
hand
.
``
Next
time
,
open
up
sooner
!
''
said
K.
's
uncle
instead
of
a
*NL*
greeting
,
while
the
girl
made
a
slight
curtsey
.
``
Come
along
,
Josef
,
''
he
*NL*
then
said
to
K.
who
was
slowly
moving
over
towards
the
girl
.
``
Dr.
Huld
*NL*
is
unwell
,
''
said
the
girl
as
K.
's
uncle
,
without
stopping
,
rushed
*NL*
towards
one
of
the
doors
.
K.
continued
to
look
at
the
girl
in
amazement
*NL*
as
she
turned
round
to
block
the
way
into
the
living
room
,
she
had
a
*NL*
round
face
like
a
puppy
's
,
not
only
the
pale
cheeks
and
the
chin
were
*NL*
round
but
the
temples
and
the
hairline
were
too
.
``
Josef
!
''
called
his
*NL*
uncle
once
more
,
and
he
asked
the
girl
,
``
It
's
trouble
with
his
heart
,
is
*NL*
it
?
''
``
I
think
it
is
,
sir
,
''
said
the
girl
,
who
by
now
had
found
time
to
*NL*
go
ahead
with
the
candle
and
open
the
door
into
the
room
.
In
one
corner
*NL*
of
the
room
,
where
the
light
of
the
candle
did
not
reach
,
a
face
with
a
*NL*
long
beard
looked
up
from
the
bed
.
``
Leni
,
who
's
this
coming
in
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
lawyer
,
unable
to
recognise
his
guests
because
he
was
dazzled
by
the
*NL*
candle
.
``
It
's
your
old
friend
,
Albert
,
''
said
K.
's
uncle
.
``
Oh
,
Albert
,
''
*NL*
said
the
lawyer
,
falling
back
onto
his
pillow
as
if
this
visit
meant
he
*NL*
would
not
need
to
keep
up
appearances
.
``
Is
it
really
as
bad
as
that
?
''
*NL*
asked
K.
's
uncle
,
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
*NL*
is
.
It
's
a
recurrence
of
your
heart
trouble
and
it
'll
pass
over
like
*NL*
the
other
times
.
''
``
Maybe
,
''
said
the
lawyer
quietly
,
``
but
it
's
just
as
*NL*
much
trouble
as
it
's
ever
been
.
I
can
hardly
breathe
,
I
ca
n't
sleep
at
*NL*
all
and
I
'm
getting
weaker
by
the
day
.
''
``
I
see
,
''
said
K.
's
uncle
,
*NL*
pressing
his
panama
hat
firmly
against
his
knee
with
his
big
hand
.
*NL*
``
That
is
bad
news
.
But
are
you
getting
the
right
sort
of
care
?
And
*NL*
it
's
so
depressing
in
here
,
it
's
so
dark
.
It
's
a
long
time
since
I
was
*NL*
last
here
,
but
it
seemed
to
me
friendlier
then
.
Even
your
young
lady
*NL*
here
does
n't
seem
to
have
much
life
in
her
,
unless
she
's
just
*NL*
pretending
.
''
The
maid
was
still
standing
by
the
door
with
the
candle
;
*NL*
as
far
as
could
be
made
out
,
she
was
watching
K.
more
than
she
was
*NL*
watching
his
uncle
even
while
the
latter
was
still
speaking
about
her
.
*NL*
K.
leant
against
a
chair
that
he
had
pushed
near
to
the
girl
.
``
When
*NL*
you
're
as
ill
as
I
am
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
``
you
need
to
have
peace
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
find
it
depressing
.
''
After
a
short
pause
he
added
,
``
and
Leni
*NL*
looks
after
me
well
,
she
's
a
good
girl
.
''
But
that
was
not
enough
to
*NL*
persuade
K.
's
uncle
,
he
had
visibly
taken
against
his
friend
's
carer
*NL*
and
,
even
though
he
did
not
contradict
the
invalid
,
he
persecuted
her
*NL*
with
his
scowl
as
she
went
over
to
the
bed
,
put
the
candle
on
the
*NL*
bedside
table
and
,
leaning
over
the
bed
,
made
a
fuss
of
him
by
tidying
*NL*
the
pillows
.
K.
's
uncle
nearly
forgot
the
need
to
show
any
*NL*
consideration
for
the
man
who
lay
ill
in
bed
,
he
stood
up
,
walked
up
and
*NL*
down
behind
the
carer
,
and
K.
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
*NL*
grabbed
hold
of
her
skirts
behind
her
and
dragged
her
away
from
the
bed
.
*NL*
K.
himself
looked
on
calmly
,
he
was
not
even
disappointed
at
finding
the
*NL*
lawyer
unwell
,
he
had
been
able
to
do
nothing
to
oppose
the
enthusiasm
*NL*
his
uncle
had
developed
for
the
matter
,
he
was
glad
that
this
enthusiasm
*NL*
had
now
been
distracted
without
his
having
to
do
anything
about
it
.
His
*NL*
uncle
,
probably
simply
wishing
to
be
offensive
to
the
lawyer
's
*NL*
attendant
,
then
said
,
``
Young
lady
,
now
please
leave
us
alone
for
a
*NL*
while
,
I
have
some
personal
matters
to
discuss
with
my
friend
.
''
Dr.
*NL*
Huld
's
carer
was
still
leant
far
over
the
invalid
's
bed
and
smoothing
*NL*
out
the
cloth
covering
the
wall
next
to
it
,
she
merely
turned
her
head
*NL*
and
then
,
in
striking
contrast
with
the
anger
that
first
stopped
K.
's
*NL*
uncle
from
speaking
and
then
let
the
words
out
in
a
gush
,
she
said
very
*NL*
quietly
,
``
You
can
see
that
Dr.
Huld
is
so
ill
that
he
ca
n't
discuss
any
*NL*
matters
at
all
.
''
It
was
probably
just
for
the
sake
of
convenience
that
*NL*
she
had
repeated
the
words
spoken
by
K.
's
uncle
,
but
an
onlooker
might
*NL*
even
have
perceived
it
as
mocking
him
and
he
,
of
course
,
jumped
up
as
if
*NL*
he
had
just
been
stabbed
.
``
You
damned
...
,
''
in
the
first
gurglings
of
*NL*
his
excitement
his
words
could
hardly
be
understood
,
K.
was
startled
*NL*
even
though
he
had
been
expecting
something
of
the
sort
and
ran
to
his
*NL*
uncle
with
the
intention
,
no
doubt
,
of
closing
his
mouth
with
both
his
*NL*
hands
.
Fortunately
,
though
,
behind
the
girl
,
the
invalid
raised
himself
*NL*
up
,
K.
's
uncle
made
an
ugly
face
as
if
swallowing
something
disgusting
*NL*
and
then
,
somewhat
calmer
,
said
,
``
We
have
naturally
not
lost
our
senses
,
*NL*
not
yet
;
if
what
I
am
asking
for
were
not
possible
I
would
not
be
asking
*NL*
for
it
.
Now
please
,
go
!
''
The
carer
stood
up
straight
by
the
bed
*NL*
directly
facing
K.
's
uncle
,
K.
thought
he
noticed
that
with
one
hand
she
*NL*
was
stroking
the
lawyer
's
hand
.
``
You
can
say
anything
in
front
of
*NL*
Leni
,
''
said
the
invalid
,
in
a
tone
that
was
unmistakably
imploring
.
*NL*
``
It
's
not
my
business
,
''
said
K.
's
uncle
,
``
and
it
's
not
my
secrets
.
''
And
*NL*
he
twisted
himself
round
as
if
wanting
to
go
into
no
more
negotiations
*NL*
but
giving
himself
a
little
more
time
to
think
.
``
Whose
business
is
it
*NL*
then
?
''
asked
the
lawyer
in
an
exhausted
voice
as
he
leant
back
again
.
*NL*
``
My
nephew
's
,
''
said
K.
's
uncle
,
``
and
I
've
brought
him
along
with
me
.
''
*NL*
And
he
introduced
him
,
``
Chief
Clerk
Josef
K.
''
``
Oh
!
''
said
the
invalid
,
*NL*
now
with
much
more
life
in
him
,
and
reached
out
his
hand
towards
K.
``
Do
*NL*
forgive
me
,
I
did
n't
notice
you
there
at
all
.
''
Then
he
then
said
to
his
*NL*
carer
,
``
Leni
,
go
,
''
stretching
his
hand
out
to
her
as
if
this
were
a
*NL*
farewell
that
would
have
to
last
for
a
long
time
.
This
time
the
girl
*NL*
offered
no
resistance
.
``
So
you
,
''
he
finally
said
to
K.
's
uncle
,
who
had
*NL*
also
calmed
down
and
stepped
closer
,
``
you
have
n't
come
to
visit
me
*NL*
because
I
'm
ill
but
you
've
come
on
business
.
''
The
lawyer
now
looked
so
*NL*
much
stronger
that
it
seemed
the
idea
of
being
visited
because
he
was
*NL*
ill
had
somehow
made
him
weak
,
he
remained
supporting
himself
of
one
*NL*
elbow
,
which
must
have
been
rather
tiring
,
and
continually
pulled
at
a
*NL*
lock
of
hair
in
the
middle
of
his
beard
.
``
You
already
look
much
*NL*
better
,
''
said
K.
's
uncle
,
``
now
that
that
witch
has
gone
outside
.
''
He
*NL*
interrupted
himself
,
whispered
,
``
I
bet
you
she
's
listening
!
''
and
sprang
*NL*
over
to
the
door
.
But
behind
the
door
there
was
no-one
,
K.
's
uncle
came
*NL*
back
not
disappointed
,
as
her
not
listening
seemed
to
him
worse
than
if
*NL*
she
had
been
,
but
probably
somewhat
embittered
.
``
You
're
mistaken
about
*NL*
her
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
but
did
nothing
more
to
defend
her
;
perhaps
that
*NL*
was
his
way
of
indicating
that
she
did
not
need
defending
.
But
in
a
*NL*
tone
that
was
much
more
committed
he
went
on
,
``
As
far
as
your
nephew
's
*NL*
affairs
are
concerned
,
this
will
be
an
extremely
difficult
undertaking
*NL*
and
I
'd
count
myself
lucky
if
my
strength
lasted
out
long
enough
for
it
;
*NL*
I
'm
greatly
afraid
it
wo
n't
do
,
but
anyway
I
do
n't
want
to
leave
*NL*
anything
untried
;
if
I
do
n't
last
out
you
can
always
get
somebody
else
.
*NL*
To
be
honest
,
this
matter
interests
me
too
much
,
and
I
ca
n't
bring
*NL*
myself
to
give
up
the
chance
of
taking
some
part
in
it
.
If
my
heart
*NL*
does
totally
give
out
then
at
least
it
will
have
found
a
worthy
affair
*NL*
to
fail
in
.
''
K.
believed
he
understood
not
a
word
of
this
entire
*NL*
speech
,
he
looked
at
his
uncle
for
an
explanation
but
his
uncle
sat
on
*NL*
the
bedside
table
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
,
a
medicine
bottle
had
*NL*
rolled
off
the
table
onto
the
floor
,
he
nodded
to
everything
the
lawyer
*NL*
said
,
agreed
to
everything
,
and
now
and
then
looked
at
K.
urging
him
to
*NL*
show
the
same
compliance
.
Maybe
K.
's
uncle
had
already
told
the
lawyer
*NL*
about
the
trial
.
But
that
was
impossible
,
everything
that
had
happened
*NL*
so
far
spoke
against
it
.
So
he
said
,
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
...
''
``
Well
,
maybe
I
've
misunderstood
what
you
've
*NL*
been
saying
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
just
as
astonished
and
embarrassed
as
K.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
've
been
going
too
fast
.
What
was
it
you
wanted
to
speak
to
*NL*
me
about
?
I
thought
it
was
to
do
with
your
trial
.
''
``
Of
course
it
is
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
's
uncle
,
who
then
asked
K.
,
``
So
what
is
it
you
want
?
''
``
Yes
,
but
*NL*
how
is
it
that
you
know
anything
about
me
and
my
case
?
''
asked
K.
``
Oh
,
I
*NL*
see
,
''
said
the
lawyer
with
a
smile
.
``
I
am
a
lawyer
,
I
move
in
court
*NL*
circles
,
people
talk
about
various
different
cases
and
the
more
*NL*
interesting
ones
stay
in
your
mind
,
especially
when
they
concern
the
*NL*
nephew
of
a
friend
.
There
's
nothing
very
remarkable
about
that
.
''
``
What
*NL*
is
it
you
want
,
then
?
''
asked
K.
's
uncle
once
more
,
``
You
seem
so
uneasy
*NL*
about
it
''
``
You
move
in
this
court
's
circles
?
''
asked
K.
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lawyer
.
``
You
're
asking
questions
like
a
child
,
''
said
K.
's
uncle
.
``
What
*NL*
circles
should
I
move
in
,
then
,
if
not
with
members
of
my
own
*NL*
discipline
?
''
the
lawyer
added
.
It
sounded
so
indisputable
that
K.
gave
*NL*
no
answer
at
all
.
``
But
you
work
in
the
High
Court
,
not
that
court
in
*NL*
the
attic
,
''
he
had
wanted
to
say
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
actually
*NL*
utter
it
.
``
You
have
to
realise
,
''
the
lawyer
continued
,
in
a
tone
as
if
*NL*
he
were
explaining
something
obvious
,
unnecessary
and
incidental
,
``
you
*NL*
have
to
realise
that
I
also
derive
great
advantage
for
my
clients
from
*NL*
mixing
with
those
people
,
and
do
so
in
many
different
ways
,
it
's
not
*NL*
something
you
can
keep
talking
about
all
the
time
.
I
'm
at
a
bit
of
a
*NL*
disadvantage
now
,
of
course
,
because
of
my
illness
,
but
I
still
get
*NL*
visits
from
some
good
friends
of
mine
at
the
court
and
I
learn
one
or
*NL*
two
things
.
It
might
even
be
that
I
learn
more
than
many
of
those
who
*NL*
are
in
the
best
of
health
and
spend
all
day
in
court
.
And
I
'm
receiving
*NL*
a
very
welcome
visit
right
now
,
for
instance
.
''
And
he
pointed
into
a
*NL*
dark
corner
of
the
room
.
``
Where
?
''
asked
K.
,
almost
uncouth
in
his
*NL*
surprise
.
He
looked
round
uneasily
;
the
little
candle
gave
off
far
too
*NL*
little
light
to
reach
as
far
as
the
wall
opposite
.
And
then
,
something
*NL*
did
indeed
begin
to
move
there
in
the
corner
.
In
the
light
of
the
*NL*
candle
held
up
by
K.
's
uncle
an
elderly
gentleman
could
be
seen
sitting
*NL*
beside
a
small
table
.
He
had
been
sitting
there
for
so
long
without
*NL*
being
noticed
that
he
could
hardly
have
been
breathing
.
Now
he
stood
up
*NL*
with
a
great
deal
of
fuss
,
clearly
unhappy
that
attention
had
been
drawn
*NL*
to
him
.
It
was
as
if
,
by
flapping
his
hands
about
like
short
wings
,
he
*NL*
hoped
to
deflect
any
introductions
and
greetings
,
as
if
he
wanted
on
no
*NL*
account
to
disturb
the
others
by
his
presence
and
seemed
to
be
exhorting
*NL*
them
to
leave
him
back
in
the
dark
and
forget
about
his
being
there
.
*NL*
That
,
however
,
was
something
that
could
no
longer
be
granted
him
.
``
You
*NL*
took
us
by
surprise
,
you
see
,
''
said
the
lawyer
in
explanation
,
*NL*
cheerfully
indicating
to
the
gentleman
that
he
should
come
closer
,
*NL*
which
,
slowly
,
hesitatingly
,
looking
all
around
him
,
but
with
a
certain
*NL*
dignity
,
he
did
.
``
The
office
director
-
oh
,
yes
,
forgive
me
,
I
have
n't
*NL*
introduced
you
-
this
is
my
friend
Albert
K.
,
this
is
his
nephew
,
the
*NL*
chief
clerk
Josef
K.
,
and
this
is
the
office
director
-
so
,
the
office
*NL*
director
was
kind
enough
to
pay
me
a
visit
.
It
's
only
possible
to
*NL*
appreciate
just
how
valuable
a
visit
like
this
is
if
you
've
been
let
*NL*
into
the
secret
of
what
a
pile
of
work
the
office
director
has
heaped
*NL*
over
him
.
Well
,
he
came
anyway
,
we
were
having
a
peaceful
chat
,
as
far
*NL*
as
I
was
able
when
I
'm
so
weak
,
and
although
we
had
n't
told
Leni
she
*NL*
must
n't
let
anyone
in
as
we
were
n't
expecting
anyone
,
we
still
would
*NL*
rather
have
remained
alone
,
but
then
along
came
you
,
Albert
,
thumping
*NL*
your
fists
on
the
door
,
the
office
director
moved
over
into
the
corner
*NL*
pulling
his
table
and
chair
with
him
,
but
now
it
turns
out
we
might
*NL*
have
,
that
is
,
if
that
's
what
you
wish
,
we
might
have
something
to
*NL*
discuss
with
each
other
and
it
would
be
good
if
we
can
all
come
back
*NL*
together
again
.
-
Office
director
...
,
''
he
said
with
his
head
on
one
*NL*
side
,
pointing
with
a
humble
smile
to
an
armchair
near
the
bed
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
afraid
I
'll
only
be
able
to
stay
a
few
minutes
more
,
''
smiled
the
office
*NL*
director
as
he
spread
himself
out
in
the
armchair
and
looked
at
the
*NL*
clock
.
``
Business
calls
.
But
I
would
n't
want
to
miss
the
chance
of
*NL*
meeting
a
friend
of
my
friend
.
''
He
inclined
his
head
slightly
toward
*NL*
K.
's
uncle
,
who
seemed
very
happy
with
his
new
acquaintance
,
but
he
was
*NL*
not
the
sort
of
person
to
express
his
feelings
of
deference
and
*NL*
responded
to
the
office
director
's
words
with
embarrassed
,
but
loud
,
*NL*
laughter
.
A
horrible
sight
!
K.
was
able
to
quietly
watch
everything
as
*NL*
nobody
paid
any
attention
to
him
,
the
office
director
took
over
as
*NL*
leader
of
the
conversation
as
seemed
to
be
his
habit
once
he
had
been
*NL*
called
forward
,
the
lawyer
listened
attentively
with
his
hand
to
his
*NL*
ear
,
his
initial
weakness
having
perhaps
only
had
the
function
of
*NL*
driving
away
his
new
visitors
,
K.
's
uncle
served
as
candle-bearer
-
*NL*
balancing
the
candle
on
his
thigh
while
the
office
director
frequently
*NL*
glanced
nervously
at
it
-
and
was
soon
free
of
his
embarrassment
and
was
*NL*
quickly
enchanted
not
only
by
the
office
director
's
speaking
manner
but
*NL*
also
by
the
gentle
,
waving
hand-movements
with
which
he
accompanied
it
.
*NL*
K.
,
leaning
against
the
bedpost
,
was
totally
ignored
by
the
office
*NL*
director
,
perhaps
deliberately
,
and
served
the
old
man
only
as
audience
.
*NL*
And
besides
,
he
had
hardly
any
idea
what
the
conversation
was
about
and
*NL*
his
thoughts
soon
turned
to
the
care
assistant
and
the
ill
treatment
she
*NL*
had
suffered
from
his
uncle
.
Soon
after
,
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
*NL*
had
not
seen
the
office
director
somewhere
before
,
perhaps
among
the
*NL*
people
who
were
at
his
first
hearing
.
He
may
have
been
mistaken
,
but
*NL*
thought
the
office
director
might
well
have
been
among
the
old
gentlemen
*NL*
with
the
thin
beards
in
the
first
row
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
then
a
noise
that
everyone
heard
from
the
hallway
as
if
*NL*
something
of
porcelain
were
being
broken
.
``
I
'll
go
and
see
what
's
*NL*
happened
,
''
said
K.
,
who
slowly
left
the
room
as
if
giving
the
others
the
*NL*
chance
to
stop
him
.
He
had
hardly
stepped
into
the
hallway
,
finding
his
*NL*
bearings
in
the
darkness
with
his
hand
still
firmly
holding
the
door
,
*NL*
when
another
small
hand
,
much
smaller
than
K.
's
own
,
placed
itself
on
*NL*
his
and
gently
shut
the
door
.
It
was
the
carer
who
had
been
waiting
*NL*
there
.
``
Nothing
has
happened
,
''
she
whispered
to
him
,
``
I
just
threw
a
*NL*
plate
against
the
wall
to
get
you
out
of
there
.
''
``
I
was
thinking
about
*NL*
you
,
as
well
,
''
replied
K.
uneasily
.
``
So
much
the
better
,
''
said
the
*NL*
carer
.
``
Come
with
me
''
.
A
few
steps
along
,
they
came
to
a
frosted
glass
*NL*
door
which
the
carer
opened
for
him
.
``
Come
in
here
,
''
she
said
.
It
was
*NL*
clearly
the
lawyer
's
office
,
fitted
out
with
old
,
heavy
furniture
,
as
*NL*
far
as
could
be
seen
in
the
moonlight
which
now
illuminated
just
a
*NL*
small
,
rectangular
section
of
the
floor
by
each
of
the
three
big
*NL*
windows
.
``
This
way
,
''
said
the
carer
,
pointing
to
a
dark
trunk
with
a
*NL*
carved
,
wooden
backrest
.
When
he
had
sat
down
,
K.
continued
to
look
*NL*
round
the
room
,
it
was
a
large
room
with
a
high
ceiling
,
the
clients
of
*NL*
this
lawyer
for
the
poor
must
have
felt
quite
lost
in
it
.
K.
thought
he
*NL*
could
see
the
little
steps
with
which
visitors
would
approach
the
*NL*
massive
desk
.
But
then
he
forgot
about
all
of
this
and
had
eyes
only
*NL*
for
the
carer
who
sat
very
close
beside
him
,
almost
pressing
him
against
*NL*
the
armrest
.
``
I
did
think
,
''
she
said
``
you
would
come
out
here
to
me
by
*NL*
yourself
without
me
having
to
call
you
first
.
It
was
odd
.
First
you
stare
*NL*
at
me
as
soon
as
you
come
in
,
and
then
you
keep
me
waiting
.
And
you
*NL*
ought
to
call
me
Leni
,
too
,
''
she
added
quickly
and
suddenly
,
as
if
no
*NL*
moment
of
this
conversation
should
be
lost
.
``
Gladly
,
''
said
K.
``
But
as
*NL*
for
its
being
odd
,
Leni
,
that
's
easy
to
explain
.
Firstly
,
I
had
to
*NL*
listen
to
what
the
old
men
were
saying
and
could
n't
leave
without
a
good
*NL*
reason
,
but
secondly
I
'm
not
a
bold
person
,
if
anything
I
'm
quite
shy
,
*NL*
and
you
,
Leni
,
you
did
n't
really
look
like
you
could
be
won
over
in
one
*NL*
stroke
,
either
.
''
``
That
's
not
it
,
''
said
Leni
,
laying
one
arm
on
the
*NL*
armrest
and
looking
at
K.
,
``
you
did
n't
like
me
,
and
I
do
n't
suppose
you
*NL*
like
me
now
,
either
.
''
``
Liking
would
n't
be
very
much
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
evasively
.
``
Oh
!
''
she
exclaimed
with
a
smile
,
thus
making
use
of
K.
's
*NL*
comment
to
gain
an
advantage
over
him
.
So
K.
remained
silent
for
a
*NL*
while
.
By
now
,
he
had
become
used
to
the
darkness
in
the
room
and
was
*NL*
able
to
make
out
various
fixtures
and
fittings
.
He
was
especially
*NL*
impressed
by
a
large
picture
hanging
to
the
right
of
the
door
,
he
leant
*NL*
forward
in
order
to
see
it
better
.
It
depicted
a
man
wearing
a
judge
's
*NL*
robes
;
he
was
sitting
on
a
lofty
throne
gilded
in
a
way
that
shone
forth
*NL*
from
the
picture
.
The
odd
thing
about
the
picture
was
that
this
judge
*NL*
was
not
sitting
there
in
dignified
calm
but
had
his
left
arm
pressed
*NL*
against
the
back
and
armrest
,
his
right
arm
,
however
,
was
completely
*NL*
free
and
only
grasped
the
armrest
with
his
hand
,
as
if
about
to
jump
up
*NL*
any
moment
in
vigorous
outrage
and
make
some
decisive
comment
or
even
to
*NL*
pass
sentence
.
The
accused
was
probably
meant
to
be
imagined
at
the
*NL*
foot
of
the
steps
,
the
top
one
of
which
could
be
seen
in
the
picture
,
*NL*
covered
with
a
yellow
carpet
.
``
That
might
be
my
judge
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
pointing
to
the
picture
with
one
finger
.
``
I
know
him
,
''
said
Leni
*NL*
looking
up
at
the
picture
,
``
he
comes
here
quite
often
.
That
picture
is
*NL*
from
when
he
was
young
,
but
he
can
never
have
looked
anything
like
it
,
*NL*
as
he
's
tiny
,
minute
almost
.
But
despite
that
,
he
had
himself
made
to
*NL*
look
bigger
in
the
picture
as
he
's
madly
vain
,
just
like
everyone
round
*NL*
here
.
But
even
I
'm
vain
and
that
makes
me
very
unhappy
that
you
do
n't
*NL*
like
me
.
''
K.
replied
to
that
last
comment
merely
by
embracing
Leni
and
*NL*
drawing
her
towards
him
,
she
lay
her
head
quietly
on
his
shoulder
.
To
*NL*
the
rest
of
it
,
though
,
he
said
,
``
What
rank
is
he
?
''
``
He
's
an
examining
*NL*
judge
,
''
she
said
,
taking
hold
of
the
hand
with
which
K.
held
her
and
*NL*
playing
with
his
fingers
.
``
Just
an
examining
judge
once
again
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
in
disappointment
,
``
the
senior
officials
keep
themselves
hidden
.
But
*NL*
here
he
is
sitting
on
a
throne
.
''
``
That
's
all
just
made
up
,
''
said
Leni
*NL*
with
her
face
bent
over
K.
's
hand
,
``
really
he
's
sitting
on
a
kitchen
*NL*
chair
with
an
old
horse
blanket
folded
over
it
.
But
do
you
have
to
be
*NL*
always
thinking
about
your
trial
?
''
she
added
slowly
.
``
No
,
not
at
all
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
,
``
I
probably
even
think
too
little
about
it
.
''
``
That
's
not
the
*NL*
mistake
you
're
making
,
''
said
Leni
,
``
you
're
too
unyielding
,
that
's
what
*NL*
I
've
heard
.
''
``
Who
said
that
?
''
asked
K.
,
he
felt
her
body
against
his
*NL*
chest
and
looked
down
on
her
rich
,
dark
,
tightly-bound
hair
.
``
I
'd
be
*NL*
saying
too
much
if
I
told
you
that
,
''
answered
Leni
.
``
Please
do
n't
ask
*NL*
for
names
,
but
do
stop
making
these
mistakes
of
yours
,
stop
being
so
*NL*
unyielding
,
there
's
nothing
you
can
do
to
defend
yourself
from
this
*NL*
court
,
you
have
to
confess
.
So
confess
to
them
as
soon
as
you
get
the
*NL*
chance
.
It
's
only
then
that
they
give
you
the
chance
to
get
away
,
not
*NL*
till
then
.
Only
,
without
help
from
outside
even
that
's
impossible
,
but
*NL*
you
need
n't
worry
about
getting
this
help
as
I
want
to
help
you
myself
.
''
*NL*
``
You
understand
a
lot
about
this
court
and
what
sort
of
tricks
are
*NL*
needed
,
''
said
K.
as
he
lifted
her
,
since
she
was
pressing
in
much
too
*NL*
close
to
him
,
onto
his
lap
.
``
That
's
alright
,
then
,
''
she
said
,
and
made
*NL*
herself
comfortable
on
his
lap
by
smoothing
out
her
skirt
and
adjusting
*NL*
her
blouse
.
Then
she
hung
both
her
arms
around
his
neck
,
leant
back
and
*NL*
took
a
long
look
at
him
.
``
And
what
if
I
do
n't
confess
,
could
you
not
*NL*
help
me
then
?
''
asked
K.
to
test
her
out
.
I
'm
accumulating
women
to
help
*NL*
me
,
he
thought
to
himself
almost
in
amazement
,
first
Miss
Buerstner
,
then
*NL*
the
court
usher
's
wife
,
and
now
this
little
care
assistant
who
seems
to
*NL*
have
some
incomprehensible
need
for
me
.
The
way
she
sits
on
my
lap
as
*NL*
if
it
were
her
proper
place
!
``
No
,
''
answered
Leni
,
slowly
shaking
her
*NL*
head
,
``
I
could
n't
help
you
then
.
But
you
do
n't
want
my
help
anyway
,
it
*NL*
means
nothing
to
you
,
you
're
too
stubborn
and
wo
n't
be
persuaded
.
''
*NL*
Then
,
after
a
while
she
asked
,
``
Do
you
have
a
lover
?
''
``
No
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
must
have
,
''
she
said
.
``
Well
,
I
have
really
,
''
said
K.
``
Just
*NL*
think
,
I
've
even
betrayed
her
while
I
'm
carrying
her
photograph
with
*NL*
me
.
''
Leni
insisted
he
show
her
a
photograph
of
Elsa
,
and
then
,
hunched
*NL*
on
his
lap
,
studied
the
picture
closely
.
The
photograph
was
not
one
*NL*
that
had
been
taken
while
Elsa
was
posing
for
it
,
it
showed
her
just
*NL*
after
she
had
been
in
a
wild
dance
such
as
she
liked
to
do
in
wine
bars
,
*NL*
her
skirt
was
still
flung
out
as
she
span
round
,
she
had
placed
her
*NL*
hands
on
her
firm
hips
and
,
with
her
neck
held
taut
,
looked
to
one
side
*NL*
with
a
laugh
;
you
could
not
see
from
the
picture
whom
her
laugh
was
*NL*
intended
for
.
``
She
's
very
tightly
laced
,
''
said
Leni
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
place
where
she
thought
this
could
be
seen
.
``
I
do
n't
like
her
,
she
's
*NL*
clumsy
and
crude
.
But
maybe
she
's
gentle
and
friendly
towards
you
,
*NL*
that
's
the
impression
you
get
from
the
picture
.
Big
,
strong
girls
like
*NL*
that
often
do
n't
know
how
to
be
anything
but
gentle
and
friendly
.
Would
*NL*
she
be
capable
of
sacrificing
herself
for
you
,
though
?
''
``
No
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
``
she
is
n't
gentle
or
friendly
,
and
nor
would
she
be
capable
of
*NL*
sacrificing
herself
for
me
.
But
I
've
never
yet
asked
any
of
those
*NL*
things
of
her
.
I
've
never
looked
at
this
picture
as
closely
as
you
.
''
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
think
much
of
her
,
then
,
''
said
Leni
.
``
She
ca
n't
be
your
lover
*NL*
after
all
.
''
``
Yes
she
is
,
''
said
K.
,
``
I
'm
not
going
to
take
my
word
back
*NL*
on
that
.
''
``
Well
she
might
be
your
lover
now
,
then
,
''
said
Leni
,
``
but
you
*NL*
would
n't
miss
her
much
if
you
lost
her
or
if
you
exchanged
her
for
*NL*
somebody
else
,
me
for
instance
.
''
``
That
is
certainly
conceivable
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
with
a
smile
,
``
but
she
does
have
one
major
advantage
over
you
,
she
*NL*
knows
nothing
about
my
trial
,
and
even
if
she
did
she
would
n't
think
*NL*
about
it
.
She
would
n't
try
to
persuade
me
to
be
less
unyielding
.
''
``
Well
*NL*
that
's
no
advantage
,
''
said
Leni
.
``
If
she
's
got
no
advantage
other
than
*NL*
that
,
I
can
keep
on
hoping
.
Has
she
got
any
bodily
defects
?
''
''
`
Bodily
*NL*
defects
'
?
''
asked
K.
``
Yeah
,
''
said
Leni
,
``
as
I
do
have
a
bodily
defect
,
*NL*
just
a
little
one
.
Look
.
''
She
spread
the
middle
and
ring
fingers
of
*NL*
her
right
hand
apart
from
each
other
.
Between
those
fingers
the
flap
of
*NL*
skin
connecting
them
reached
up
almost
as
far
as
the
top
joint
of
the
*NL*
little
finger
.
In
the
darkness
,
K.
did
not
see
at
first
what
it
was
she
*NL*
wanted
to
show
him
,
so
she
led
his
hand
to
it
so
that
he
could
feel
.
*NL*
``
What
a
freak
of
nature
,
''
said
K.
,
and
when
he
had
taken
a
look
at
the
*NL*
whole
hand
he
added
,
``
What
a
pretty
claw
!
''
Leni
looked
on
with
a
kind
*NL*
of
pride
as
K.
repeatedly
opened
and
closed
her
two
fingers
in
*NL*
amazement
,
until
,
finally
,
he
briefly
kissed
them
and
let
go
.
``
Oh
!
''
she
*NL*
immediately
exclaimed
,
``
you
kissed
me
!
''
Hurriedly
,
and
with
her
mouth
*NL*
open
,
she
clambered
up
K.
's
lap
with
her
knees
.
He
was
almost
aghast
as
*NL*
he
looked
up
at
her
,
now
that
she
was
so
close
to
him
there
was
a
*NL*
bitter
,
irritating
smell
from
her
,
like
pepper
,
she
grasped
his
head
,
*NL*
leant
out
over
him
,
and
bit
and
kissed
his
neck
,
even
biting
into
his
*NL*
hair
.
``
I
've
taken
her
place
!
''
she
exclaimed
from
time
to
time
.
``
Just
*NL*
look
,
now
you
've
taken
me
instead
of
her
!
''
Just
then
,
her
knee
slipped
*NL*
out
and
,
with
a
little
cry
,
she
nearly
fell
down
onto
the
carpet
,
K.
*NL*
tried
to
hold
her
by
putting
his
arms
around
her
and
was
pulled
down
*NL*
with
her
.
``
Now
you
're
mine
,
''
she
said
.
Her
last
words
to
him
as
he
*NL*
left
were
,
``
Here
's
the
key
to
the
door
,
come
whenever
you
want
''
,
and
she
*NL*
planted
an
undirected
kiss
on
his
back
.
When
he
stepped
out
the
front
*NL*
door
there
was
a
light
rain
falling
,
he
was
about
to
go
to
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
street
to
see
if
he
could
still
glimpse
Leni
at
the
window
when
K.
's
*NL*
uncle
leapt
out
of
a
car
that
K.
,
thinking
of
other
things
,
had
not
seen
*NL*
waiting
outside
the
building
.
He
took
hold
of
K.
by
both
arms
and
*NL*
shoved
him
against
the
door
as
if
he
wanted
to
nail
him
to
it
.
``
Young
*NL*
man
,
''
he
shouted
,
``
how
could
you
do
a
thing
like
that
?!
Things
were
*NL*
going
well
with
this
business
of
yours
,
now
you
've
caused
it
terrible
*NL*
damage
.
You
slip
off
with
some
dirty
,
little
thing
who
,
moreover
,
is
*NL*
obviously
the
lawyer
's
beloved
,
and
stay
away
for
hours
.
You
do
n't
even
*NL*
try
to
find
an
excuse
,
do
n't
try
to
hide
anything
,
no
,
you
're
quite
open
*NL*
about
it
,
you
run
off
with
her
and
stay
there
.
And
meanwhile
we
're
*NL*
sitting
there
,
your
uncle
who
's
going
to
such
effort
for
you
,
the
lawyer
*NL*
who
needs
to
be
won
over
to
your
side
,
and
above
all
the
office
*NL*
director
,
a
very
important
gentleman
who
is
in
direct
command
of
your
*NL*
affair
in
its
present
stage
.
We
wanted
to
discuss
how
best
to
help
you
,
*NL*
I
had
to
handle
the
lawyer
very
carefully
,
he
had
to
handle
the
office
*NL*
director
carefully
,
and
you
had
most
reason
of
all
to
at
least
give
me
*NL*
some
support
.
Instead
of
which
you
stay
away
.
Eventually
we
could
n't
*NL*
keep
up
the
pretence
any
longer
,
but
these
are
polite
and
highly
capable
*NL*
men
,
they
did
n't
say
anything
about
it
so
as
to
spare
my
feelings
but
in
*NL*
the
end
not
even
they
could
continue
to
force
themselves
and
,
as
they
*NL*
could
n't
speak
about
the
matter
in
hand
,
they
became
silent
.
We
sat
*NL*
there
for
several
minutes
,
listening
to
see
whether
you
would
n't
finally
*NL*
come
back
.
All
in
vain
.
In
the
end
the
office
director
stood
up
,
as
he
*NL*
had
stayed
far
longer
than
he
had
originally
intended
,
made
his
*NL*
farewell
,
looked
at
me
in
sympathy
without
being
able
to
help
,
he
waited
*NL*
at
the
door
for
a
long
time
although
it
's
more
than
I
can
understand
why
*NL*
he
was
being
so
good
,
and
then
he
went
.
I
,
of
course
,
was
glad
he
'd
*NL*
gone
,
I
'd
been
holding
my
breath
all
this
time
.
All
this
had
even
more
*NL*
affect
on
the
lawyer
lying
there
ill
,
when
I
took
my
leave
of
him
,
the
*NL*
good
man
,
he
was
quite
unable
to
speak
.
You
have
probably
contributed
*NL*
to
his
total
collapse
and
so
brought
the
very
man
who
you
are
dependent
*NL*
on
closer
to
his
death
.
And
me
,
your
own
uncle
,
you
leave
me
here
in
*NL*
the
rain
-
just
feel
this
,
I
'm
wet
right
through
-
waiting
here
for
*NL*
hours
,
sick
with
worry
.

Chapter
Seven
*NL*
Lawyer
-
Manufacturer
-
Painter
*NL*
*NL*
One
winter
morning
-
snow
was
falling
in
the
dull
light
outside
-
*NL*
K.
was
sitting
in
his
office
,
already
extremely
tired
despite
the
early
*NL*
hour
.
He
had
told
the
servitor
he
was
engaged
in
a
major
piece
of
work
*NL*
and
none
of
the
junior
staff
should
be
allowed
in
to
see
him
,
so
he
*NL*
would
not
be
disturbed
by
them
at
least
.
But
instead
of
working
he
*NL*
turned
round
in
his
chair
,
slowly
moved
various
items
around
his
desk
,
*NL*
but
then
,
without
being
aware
of
it
,
he
lay
his
arm
stretched
out
on
the
*NL*
desk
top
and
sat
there
immobile
with
his
head
sunk
down
on
his
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
no
longer
able
to
get
the
thought
of
the
trial
out
of
his
*NL*
head
.
He
had
often
wondered
whether
it
might
not
be
a
good
idea
to
work
*NL*
out
a
written
defence
and
hand
it
in
to
the
court
.
It
would
contain
a
*NL*
short
description
of
his
life
and
explain
why
he
had
acted
the
way
he
*NL*
had
at
each
event
that
was
in
any
way
important
,
whether
he
now
*NL*
considered
he
had
acted
well
or
ill
,
and
his
reasons
for
each
.
There
*NL*
was
no
doubt
of
the
advantages
a
written
defence
of
this
sort
would
have
*NL*
over
relying
on
the
lawyer
,
who
was
anyway
not
without
his
shortcomings
.
*NL*
K.
had
no
idea
what
actions
the
lawyer
was
taking
;
it
was
certainly
not
*NL*
a
lot
,
it
was
more
than
a
month
since
the
lawyer
had
summoned
him
,
and
*NL*
none
of
the
previous
discussions
had
given
K.
the
impression
that
this
*NL*
man
would
be
able
to
do
much
for
him
.
Most
importantly
,
he
had
asked
*NL*
him
hardly
any
questions
.
And
there
were
so
many
questions
here
to
be
*NL*
asked
.
Asking
questions
were
the
most
important
thing
.
K.
had
the
*NL*
feeling
that
he
would
be
able
to
ask
all
the
questions
needed
here
*NL*
himself
.
The
lawyer
,
in
contrast
,
did
not
ask
questions
but
did
all
the
*NL*
talking
himself
or
sat
silently
facing
him
,
leant
forward
slightly
over
*NL*
the
desk
,
probably
because
he
was
hard
of
hearing
,
pulled
on
a
strand
of
*NL*
hair
in
the
middle
of
his
beard
and
looked
down
at
the
carpet
,
perhaps
*NL*
at
the
very
spot
where
K.
had
lain
with
Leni
.
Now
and
then
he
would
*NL*
give
K.
some
vague
warning
of
the
sort
you
give
to
children
.
His
*NL*
speeches
were
as
pointless
as
they
were
boring
,
and
K.
decided
that
when
*NL*
the
final
bill
came
he
would
pay
not
a
penny
for
them
.
Once
the
lawyer
*NL*
thought
he
had
humiliated
K.
sufficiently
,
he
usually
started
something
*NL*
that
would
raise
his
spirits
again
.
He
had
already
,
he
would
then
say
,
*NL*
won
many
such
cases
,
partly
or
in
whole
,
cases
which
may
not
really
have
*NL*
been
as
difficult
as
this
one
but
which
,
on
the
face
of
it
,
had
even
*NL*
less
hope
of
success
.
He
had
a
list
of
these
cases
here
in
the
drawer
-
*NL*
here
he
would
tap
on
one
or
other
of
the
drawers
in
his
desk
-
but
*NL*
could
,
unfortunately
,
not
show
them
to
K.
as
they
dealt
with
official
*NL*
secrets
.
Nonetheless
,
the
great
experience
he
had
acquired
through
all
*NL*
these
cases
would
,
of
course
,
be
of
benefit
to
K
.
He
had
,
of
course
,
*NL*
begun
work
straight
away
and
was
nearly
ready
to
submit
the
first
*NL*
documents
.
They
would
be
very
important
because
the
first
impression
*NL*
made
by
the
defence
will
often
determine
the
whole
course
of
the
*NL*
proceedings
.
Unfortunately
,
though
,
he
would
still
have
to
make
it
*NL*
clear
to
K.
that
the
first
documents
submitted
are
sometimes
not
even
*NL*
read
by
the
court
.
They
simply
put
them
with
the
other
documents
and
*NL*
point
out
that
,
for
the
time
being
,
questioning
and
observing
the
*NL*
accused
are
much
more
important
than
anything
written
.
If
the
applicant
*NL*
becomes
insistent
,
then
they
add
that
before
they
come
to
any
decision
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
all
the
material
has
been
brought
together
,
with
due
regard
,
*NL*
of
course
,
to
all
the
documents
,
then
these
first
documents
to
have
been
*NL*
submitted
will
also
be
checked
over
.
But
unfortunately
,
even
this
is
*NL*
not
usually
true
,
the
first
documents
submitted
are
usually
mislaid
or
*NL*
lost
completely
,
and
even
if
they
do
keep
them
right
to
the
end
they
are
*NL*
hardly
read
,
although
the
lawyer
only
knew
about
this
from
rumour
.
This
*NL*
is
all
very
regrettable
,
but
not
entirely
without
its
justifications
.
*NL*
But
K.
should
not
forget
that
the
trial
would
not
be
public
,
if
the
*NL*
court
deems
it
necessary
it
can
be
made
public
but
there
is
no
law
that
*NL*
says
it
has
to
be
.
As
a
result
,
the
accused
and
his
defence
do
n't
have
*NL*
access
even
to
the
court
records
,
and
especially
not
to
the
indictment
,
*NL*
and
that
means
we
generally
do
n't
know
-
or
at
least
not
precisely
-
*NL*
what
the
first
documents
need
to
be
about
,
which
means
that
if
they
do
*NL*
contain
anything
of
relevance
to
the
case
it
's
only
by
a
lucky
*NL*
coincidence
.
If
anything
about
the
individual
charges
and
the
reasons
*NL*
for
them
comes
out
clearly
or
can
be
guessed
at
while
the
accused
is
*NL*
being
questioned
,
then
it
's
possible
to
work
out
and
submit
documents
*NL*
that
really
direct
the
issue
and
present
proof
,
but
not
before
.
*NL*
Conditions
like
this
,
of
course
,
place
the
defence
in
a
very
*NL*
unfavourable
and
difficult
position
.
But
that
is
what
they
intend
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
defence
is
not
really
allowed
under
the
law
,
it
's
only
tolerated
,
*NL*
and
there
is
even
some
dispute
about
whether
the
relevant
parts
of
the
*NL*
law
imply
even
that
.
So
strictly
speaking
,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
*NL*
counsel
acknowledged
by
the
court
,
and
anyone
who
comes
before
this
*NL*
court
as
counsel
is
basically
no
more
than
a
barrack
room
lawyer
.
The
*NL*
effect
of
all
this
,
of
course
,
is
to
remove
the
dignity
of
the
whole
*NL*
procedure
,
the
next
time
K.
is
in
the
court
offices
he
might
like
to
*NL*
have
a
look
in
at
the
lawyers
'
room
,
just
so
that
he
's
seen
it
.
He
*NL*
might
well
be
quite
shocked
by
the
people
he
sees
assembled
there
.
The
*NL*
room
they
've
been
allocated
,
with
its
narrow
space
and
low
ceiling
,
will
*NL*
be
enough
to
show
what
contempt
the
court
has
for
these
people
.
The
*NL*
only
light
in
the
room
comes
through
a
little
window
that
is
so
high
up
*NL*
that
,
if
you
want
to
look
out
of
it
,
you
first
have
to
get
one
of
your
*NL*
colleagues
to
support
you
on
his
back
,
and
even
then
the
smoke
from
the
*NL*
chimney
just
in
front
of
it
will
go
up
your
nose
and
make
your
face
*NL*
black
.
In
the
floor
of
this
room
-
to
give
yet
another
example
of
the
*NL*
conditions
there
-
there
is
a
hole
that
's
been
there
for
more
than
a
*NL*
year
,
it
's
not
so
big
that
a
man
could
fall
through
,
but
it
is
big
*NL*
enough
for
your
foot
to
disappear
through
it
.
The
lawyers
'
room
is
on
*NL*
the
second
floor
of
the
attic
;
if
your
foot
does
go
through
it
will
hang
*NL*
down
into
the
first
floor
of
the
attic
underneath
it
,
and
right
in
the
*NL*
corridor
where
the
litigants
are
waiting
.
It
's
no
exaggeration
when
*NL*
lawyers
say
that
conditions
like
that
are
a
disgrace
.
Complaints
to
the
*NL*
management
do
n't
have
the
slightest
effect
,
but
the
lawyers
are
strictly
*NL*
forbidden
to
alter
anything
in
the
room
at
their
own
expense
.
But
even
*NL*
treating
the
lawyers
in
this
way
has
its
reasons
.
They
want
,
as
far
as
*NL*
possible
,
to
prevent
any
kind
of
defence
,
everything
should
be
made
the
*NL*
responsibility
of
the
accused
.
Not
a
bad
point
of
view
,
basically
,
but
*NL*
nothing
could
be
more
mistaken
than
to
think
from
that
that
lawyers
are
*NL*
not
necessary
for
the
accused
in
this
court
.
On
the
contrary
,
there
is
*NL*
no
court
where
they
are
less
needed
than
here
.
This
is
because
*NL*
proceedings
are
generally
kept
secret
not
only
from
the
public
but
also
*NL*
from
the
accused
.
Only
as
far
as
that
is
possible
,
of
course
,
but
it
is
*NL*
possible
to
a
very
large
extent
.
And
the
accused
does
n't
get
to
see
the
*NL*
court
records
either
,
and
it
's
very
difficult
to
infer
what
's
in
the
*NL*
court
records
from
what
's
been
said
during
questioning
based
on
them
,
*NL*
especially
for
the
accused
who
is
in
a
difficult
situation
and
is
faced
*NL*
with
every
possible
worry
to
distract
him
.
This
is
when
the
defence
*NL*
begins
.
Counsel
for
the
defence
are
not
normally
allowed
to
be
present
*NL*
while
the
accused
is
being
questioned
,
so
afterwards
,
and
if
possible
*NL*
still
at
the
door
of
the
interview
room
,
he
has
to
learn
what
he
can
*NL*
about
it
from
him
and
extract
whatever
he
can
that
might
be
of
use
,
even
*NL*
though
what
the
accused
has
to
report
is
often
very
confused
.
But
that
*NL*
is
not
the
most
important
thing
,
as
there
's
really
not
a
lot
that
can
be
*NL*
learned
in
this
way
,
although
in
this
,
as
with
anything
else
,
a
*NL*
competent
man
will
learn
more
than
another
.
Nonetheless
,
the
most
*NL*
important
thing
is
the
lawyer
's
personal
connections
,
that
's
where
the
*NL*
real
value
of
taking
counsel
lies
.
Now
K.
will
most
likely
have
already
*NL*
learned
from
his
own
experience
that
,
among
its
very
lowest
orders
,
the
*NL*
court
organisation
does
have
its
imperfections
,
the
court
is
strictly
*NL*
closed
to
the
public
,
but
staff
who
forget
their
duty
or
who
take
bribes
*NL*
do
,
to
some
extent
,
show
where
the
gaps
are
.
This
is
where
most
lawyers
*NL*
will
push
their
way
in
,
this
is
where
bribes
are
paid
and
information
*NL*
extracted
,
there
have
even
,
in
earlier
times
at
least
,
been
incidents
*NL*
where
documents
have
been
stolen
.
There
's
no
denying
that
some
*NL*
surprisingly
favourable
results
have
been
attained
for
the
accused
in
*NL*
this
way
,
for
a
limited
time
,
and
these
petty
advocates
then
strut
to
*NL*
and
fro
on
the
basis
of
them
and
attract
new
clients
,
but
for
the
*NL*
further
course
of
the
proceedings
it
signifies
either
nothing
or
nothing
*NL*
good
.
The
only
things
of
real
value
are
honest
personal
contacts
,
*NL*
contacts
with
higher
officials
,
albeit
higher
officials
of
the
lower
*NL*
grades
,
you
understand
.
That
is
the
only
way
the
progress
of
the
trial
*NL*
can
be
influenced
,
hardly
noticeable
at
first
,
it
's
true
,
but
from
then
*NL*
on
it
becomes
more
and
more
visible
.
There
are
,
of
course
,
not
many
*NL*
lawyers
who
can
do
this
,
and
K.
has
made
a
very
good
choice
in
this
*NL*
matter
.
There
were
probably
no
more
than
one
or
two
who
had
as
many
*NL*
contacts
as
Dr.
Huld
,
but
they
do
n't
bother
with
the
company
of
the
*NL*
lawyers
'
room
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
This
means
they
have
all
*NL*
the
less
contact
with
the
court
officials
.
It
is
not
at
all
necessary
*NL*
for
Dr.
Huld
to
go
to
the
court
,
wait
in
the
ante-rooms
for
the
*NL*
examining
judges
to
turn
up
,
if
they
turn
up
,
and
try
to
achieve
*NL*
something
which
,
according
to
the
judges
'
mood
is
usually
more
apparent
*NL*
than
real
and
most
often
not
even
that
.
No
,
K.
has
seen
for
himself
*NL*
that
the
court
officials
,
including
some
who
are
quite
high
up
,
come
*NL*
forward
without
being
asked
,
are
glad
to
give
information
which
is
fully
*NL*
open
or
at
least
easy
to
understand
,
they
discuss
the
next
stages
in
the
*NL*
proceedings
,
in
fact
in
some
cases
they
can
be
won
over
and
are
quite
*NL*
willing
to
adopt
the
other
person
's
point
of
view
.
However
,
when
this
*NL*
happens
,
you
should
never
trust
them
too
far
,
as
however
firmly
they
may
*NL*
have
declared
this
new
point
of
view
in
favour
of
the
defendant
they
*NL*
might
well
go
straight
back
to
their
offices
and
write
a
report
for
the
*NL*
court
that
says
just
the
opposite
,
and
might
well
be
even
harder
on
the
*NL*
defendant
than
the
original
view
,
the
one
they
insist
they
've
been
fully
*NL*
dissuaded
from
.
And
,
of
course
,
there
's
no
way
of
defending
yourself
*NL*
from
this
,
something
said
in
private
is
indeed
in
private
and
can
not
*NL*
then
be
used
in
public
,
it
's
not
something
that
makes
it
easy
for
the
*NL*
defence
to
keep
those
gentlemen
's
favour
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
's
also
*NL*
true
that
the
gentlemen
do
n't
become
involved
with
the
defence
-
which
*NL*
will
of
course
be
done
with
great
expertise
-
just
for
philanthropic
*NL*
reasons
or
in
order
to
be
friendly
,
in
some
respects
it
would
be
truer
*NL*
to
say
that
they
,
too
,
have
it
allocated
to
them
.
This
is
where
the
*NL*
disadvantages
of
a
court
structure
that
,
right
from
the
start
,
*NL*
stipulates
that
all
proceedings
take
place
in
private
,
come
into
force
.
*NL*
In
normal
,
mediocre
trials
its
officials
have
contact
with
the
public
,
*NL*
and
they
're
very
well
equipped
for
it
,
but
here
they
do
n't
;
normal
*NL*
trials
run
their
course
all
by
themselves
,
almost
,
and
just
need
a
nudge
*NL*
here
and
there
;
but
when
they
're
faced
with
cases
that
are
especially
*NL*
difficult
they
're
as
lost
as
they
often
are
with
ones
that
are
very
*NL*
simple
;
they
're
forced
to
spend
all
their
time
,
day
and
night
,
with
*NL*
their
laws
,
and
so
they
do
n't
have
the
right
feel
for
human
*NL*
relationships
,
and
that
's
a
serious
shortcoming
in
cases
like
this
.
*NL*
That
's
when
they
come
for
advice
to
the
lawyer
,
with
a
servant
behind
*NL*
them
carrying
the
documents
which
normally
are
kept
so
secret
.
You
*NL*
could
have
seen
many
gentlemen
at
this
window
,
gentlemen
of
whom
you
*NL*
would
least
expect
it
,
staring
out
this
window
in
despair
on
the
street
*NL*
below
while
the
lawyer
is
at
his
desk
studying
the
documents
so
that
he
*NL*
can
give
them
good
advice
.
And
at
times
like
that
it
's
also
possible
to
*NL*
see
how
exceptionally
seriously
these
gentlemen
take
their
professions
*NL*
and
how
they
are
thrown
into
great
confusion
by
difficulties
which
it
's
*NL*
just
not
in
their
natures
to
overcome
.
But
they
're
not
in
an
easy
*NL*
position
,
to
regard
their
positions
as
easy
would
be
to
do
them
an
*NL*
injustice
.
The
different
ranks
and
hierarchies
of
the
court
are
*NL*
endless
,
and
even
someone
who
knows
his
way
around
them
can
not
always
*NL*
tell
what
's
going
to
happen
.
But
even
for
the
junior
officials
,
the
*NL*
proceedings
in
the
courtrooms
are
usually
kept
secret
,
so
they
are
*NL*
hardly
able
to
see
how
the
cases
they
work
with
proceed
,
court
affairs
*NL*
appear
in
their
range
of
vision
often
without
their
knowing
where
they
*NL*
come
from
and
they
move
on
further
without
their
learning
where
they
go
.
*NL*
So
civil
servants
like
this
are
not
able
to
learn
the
things
you
can
*NL*
learn
from
studying
the
successive
stages
that
individual
trials
go
*NL*
through
,
the
final
verdict
or
the
reasons
for
it
.
They
're
only
allowed
*NL*
to
deal
with
that
part
of
the
trial
which
the
law
allocates
them
,
and
*NL*
they
usually
know
less
about
the
results
of
their
work
after
it
's
left
*NL*
them
than
the
defence
does
,
even
though
the
defence
will
usually
stay
in
*NL*
contact
with
the
accused
until
the
trial
is
nearly
at
its
end
,
so
that
*NL*
the
court
officials
can
learn
many
useful
things
from
the
defence
.
*NL*
Bearing
all
this
in
mind
,
does
it
still
surprise
K.
that
the
officials
*NL*
are
irritated
and
often
express
themselves
about
the
litigants
in
*NL*
unflattering
ways
-
which
is
an
experience
shared
by
everyone
.
All
the
*NL*
officials
are
irritated
,
even
when
they
appear
calm
.
This
causes
many
*NL*
difficulties
for
the
junior
advocates
,
of
course
.
There
is
a
story
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
that
has
very
much
the
ring
of
truth
about
it
.
It
goes
like
*NL*
this
:
One
of
the
older
officials
,
a
good
and
peaceful
man
,
was
dealing
*NL*
with
a
difficult
matter
for
the
court
which
had
become
very
confused
,
*NL*
especially
thanks
to
the
contributions
from
the
lawyers
.
He
had
been
*NL*
studying
it
for
a
day
and
a
night
without
a
break
-
as
these
officials
*NL*
are
indeed
hard
working
,
no-one
works
as
hard
as
they
do
.
When
it
was
*NL*
nearly
morning
,
and
he
had
been
working
for
twenty-four
hours
with
*NL*
probably
very
little
result
,
he
went
to
the
front
entrance
,
waited
there
*NL*
in
ambush
,
and
every
time
a
lawyer
tried
to
enter
the
building
he
would
*NL*
throw
him
down
the
steps
.
The
lawyers
gathered
together
down
in
front
*NL*
of
the
steps
and
discussed
with
each
other
what
they
should
do
;
on
the
*NL*
one
hand
they
had
actually
no
right
to
be
allowed
into
the
building
so
*NL*
that
there
was
hardly
anything
that
they
could
legally
do
to
the
*NL*
official
and
,
as
I
've
already
mentioned
,
they
would
have
to
be
careful
*NL*
not
to
set
all
the
officials
against
them
.
On
the
other
hand
,
any
day
*NL*
not
spent
in
court
is
a
day
lost
for
them
and
it
was
a
matter
of
some
*NL*
importance
to
force
their
way
inside
.
In
the
end
,
they
agreed
that
they
*NL*
would
try
to
tire
the
old
man
out
.
One
lawyer
after
another
was
sent
*NL*
out
to
run
up
the
steps
and
let
himself
be
thrown
down
again
,
offering
*NL*
what
resistance
he
could
as
long
as
it
was
passive
resistance
,
and
his
*NL*
colleagues
would
catch
him
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
.
That
went
on
for
*NL*
about
an
hour
until
the
old
gentleman
,
who
was
already
exhausted
from
*NL*
working
all
night
,
was
very
tired
and
went
back
to
his
office
.
Those
*NL*
who
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
steps
could
not
believe
it
at
first
,
so
*NL*
they
sent
somebody
out
to
go
and
look
behind
the
door
to
see
if
there
*NL*
really
was
no-one
there
,
and
only
then
did
they
all
gather
together
and
*NL*
probably
did
n't
even
dare
to
complain
,
as
it
's
far
from
being
the
*NL*
lawyers
'
job
to
introduce
any
improvements
in
the
court
system
,
or
even
*NL*
to
want
to
.
Even
the
most
junior
lawyer
can
understand
the
relationship
*NL*
there
to
some
extent
,
but
one
significant
point
is
that
almost
every
*NL*
defendant
,
even
very
simple
people
,
begins
to
think
of
suggestions
for
*NL*
improving
the
court
as
soon
as
his
proceedings
have
begun
,
many
of
them
*NL*
often
even
spend
time
and
energy
on
the
matter
that
could
be
spent
far
*NL*
better
elsewhere
.
The
only
right
thing
to
do
is
to
learn
how
to
deal
*NL*
with
the
situation
as
it
is
.
Even
if
it
were
possible
to
improve
any
*NL*
detail
of
it
-
which
is
anyway
no
more
than
superstitious
nonsense
-
the
*NL*
best
that
they
could
achieve
,
although
doing
themselves
incalculable
*NL*
harm
in
the
process
,
is
that
they
will
have
attracted
the
special
*NL*
attention
of
the
officials
for
any
case
that
comes
up
in
the
future
,
and
*NL*
the
officials
are
always
ready
to
seek
revenge
.
Never
attract
attention
*NL*
to
yourself
!
Stay
calm
,
however
much
it
goes
against
your
character
!
*NL*
Try
to
gain
some
insight
into
the
size
of
the
court
organism
and
how
,
to
*NL*
some
extent
,
it
remains
in
a
state
of
suspension
,
and
that
even
if
you
*NL*
alter
something
in
one
place
you
'll
draw
the
ground
out
from
under
your
*NL*
feet
and
might
fall
,
whereas
if
an
enormous
organism
like
the
court
is
*NL*
disrupted
in
any
one
place
it
finds
it
easy
to
provide
a
substitute
for
*NL*
itself
somewhere
else
.
Everything
is
connected
with
everything
else
and
*NL*
will
continue
without
any
change
or
else
,
which
is
quite
probable
,
even
*NL*
more
closed
,
more
attentive
,
more
strict
,
more
malevolent
.
So
it
's
best
*NL*
to
leave
the
work
to
the
lawyers
and
not
to
keep
disturbing
them
.
It
*NL*
does
n't
do
much
good
to
make
accusations
,
especially
if
you
ca
n't
make
*NL*
it
clear
what
they
're
based
on
and
their
full
significance
,
but
it
must
*NL*
be
said
that
K.
caused
a
great
deal
of
harm
to
his
own
case
by
his
*NL*
behaviour
towards
the
office
director
,
he
was
a
very
influential
man
but
*NL*
now
he
might
as
well
be
struck
off
the
list
of
those
who
might
do
*NL*
anything
for
K
.
If
the
trial
is
mentioned
,
even
just
in
passing
,
it
's
*NL*
quite
obvious
that
he
's
ignoring
it
.
These
officials
are
in
many
ways
*NL*
just
like
children
.
Often
,
something
quite
harmless
-
although
K.
's
*NL*
behaviour
could
unfortunately
not
be
called
harmless
-
will
leave
them
*NL*
feeling
so
offended
that
they
will
even
stop
talking
with
good
friends
*NL*
of
theirs
,
they
turn
away
when
they
see
them
and
do
everything
they
can
*NL*
to
oppose
them
.
But
then
,
with
no
particular
reason
,
surprisingly
*NL*
enough
,
some
little
joke
that
was
only
ever
attempted
because
everything
*NL*
seemed
so
hopeless
will
make
them
laugh
and
they
'll
be
reconciled
.
*NL*
It
's
both
difficult
and
hard
at
the
same
time
to
deal
with
them
,
and
*NL*
there
's
hardly
any
reason
for
it
.
It
's
sometimes
quite
astonishing
that
*NL*
a
single
,
average
life
is
enough
to
encompass
so
much
that
it
's
at
all
*NL*
possible
ever
to
have
any
success
in
one
's
work
here
.
On
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
there
are
also
dark
moments
,
such
as
everyone
has
,
when
you
think
*NL*
you
've
achieved
nothing
at
all
,
when
it
seems
that
the
only
trials
to
*NL*
come
to
a
good
end
are
those
that
were
determined
to
have
a
good
end
*NL*
from
the
start
and
would
do
so
without
any
help
,
while
all
the
others
*NL*
are
lost
despite
all
the
running
to
and
fro
,
all
the
effort
,
all
the
*NL*
little
,
apparent
successes
that
gave
such
joy
.
Then
you
no
longer
feel
*NL*
very
sure
of
anything
and
,
if
asked
about
a
trial
that
was
doing
well
by
*NL*
its
own
nature
but
which
was
turned
for
the
worse
because
you
assisted
*NL*
in
it
,
would
not
even
dare
deny
that
.
And
even
that
is
a
kind
of
self
-
*NL*
confidence
,
but
then
it
's
the
only
one
that
's
left
.
Lawyers
are
*NL*
especially
vulnerable
to
fits
of
depression
of
that
sort
-
and
they
are
*NL*
no
more
than
fits
of
depression
of
course
-
when
a
case
is
suddenly
*NL*
taken
out
of
their
hands
after
they
've
been
conducting
it
satisfactorily
*NL*
for
some
time
.
That
's
probably
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
a
lawyer
.
*NL*
It
's
not
that
the
accused
takes
the
case
away
from
him
,
that
hardly
ever
*NL*
happens
,
once
a
defendant
has
taken
on
a
certain
lawyer
he
has
to
stay
*NL*
with
him
whatever
happens
.
How
could
he
ever
carry
on
by
himself
after
*NL*
he
's
taken
on
help
from
a
lawyer
?
No
,
that
just
does
n't
happen
,
but
*NL*
what
does
sometimes
happen
is
that
the
trial
takes
on
a
course
where
the
*NL*
lawyer
may
not
go
along
with
it
.
Client
and
trial
are
both
simply
taken
*NL*
away
from
the
lawyer
;
and
then
even
contact
with
the
court
officials
*NL*
wo
n't
help
,
however
good
they
are
,
as
they
do
n't
know
anything
*NL*
themselves
.
The
trial
will
have
entered
a
stage
where
no
more
help
can
*NL*
be
given
,
where
it
's
being
processed
in
courts
to
which
no-one
has
any
*NL*
access
,
where
the
defendant
can
not
even
be
contacted
by
his
lawyer
.
You
*NL*
come
home
one
day
and
find
all
the
documents
you
've
submitted
,
which
*NL*
you
've
worked
hard
to
create
and
which
you
had
the
best
hopes
for
,
lying
*NL*
on
the
desk
,
they
've
been
sent
back
as
they
ca
n't
be
carried
through
to
*NL*
the
next
stage
in
the
trial
,
they
're
just
worthless
scraps
of
paper
.
It
*NL*
does
n't
mean
that
the
case
has
been
lost
,
not
at
all
,
or
at
least
there
*NL*
is
no
decisive
reason
for
supposing
so
,
it
's
just
that
you
do
n't
know
*NL*
anything
more
about
the
case
and
wo
n't
be
told
anything
of
what
's
*NL*
happening
.
Well
,
cases
like
that
are
the
exceptions
,
I
'm
glad
to
say
,
*NL*
and
even
if
K.
's
trial
is
one
of
them
,
it
's
still
,
for
the
time
being
,
a
*NL*
long
way
off
.
But
there
was
still
plenty
of
opportunity
for
lawyers
to
*NL*
get
to
work
,
and
K.
could
be
sure
they
would
be
made
use
of
.
As
he
had
*NL*
said
,
the
time
for
submitting
documents
was
still
in
the
future
and
*NL*
there
was
no
rush
to
prepare
them
,
it
was
much
more
important
to
start
*NL*
the
initial
discussions
with
the
appropriate
officials
,
and
they
had
*NL*
already
taken
place
.
With
varying
degrees
of
success
,
it
must
be
said
.
*NL*
It
was
much
better
not
to
give
away
any
details
before
their
time
,
as
in
*NL*
that
way
K.
could
only
be
influenced
unfavourably
and
his
hopes
might
be
*NL*
raised
or
he
might
be
made
too
anxious
,
better
just
to
say
that
some
*NL*
individuals
have
spoken
very
favourably
and
shown
themselves
very
*NL*
willing
to
help
,
although
others
have
spoken
less
favourably
,
but
even
*NL*
they
have
not
in
any
way
refused
to
help
.
So
all
in
all
,
the
results
*NL*
are
very
encouraging
,
only
you
should
certainly
not
draw
any
particular
*NL*
conclusions
as
all
preliminary
proceedings
begin
in
the
same
way
and
it
*NL*
was
only
the
way
they
developed
further
that
would
show
what
the
value
*NL*
of
these
preliminary
proceedings
has
been
.
Anyway
,
nothing
has
been
*NL*
lost
yet
,
and
if
we
can
succeed
in
getting
the
office
director
,
despite
*NL*
everything
,
on
our
side
-
and
several
actions
have
been
undertaken
to
*NL*
this
end
-
then
everything
is
a
clean
wound
,
as
a
surgeon
would
say
,
and
*NL*
we
can
wait
for
the
results
with
some
comfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
started
talking
on
in
this
way
the
lawyer
was
quite
*NL*
tireless
.
He
went
through
it
all
again
every
time
K.
went
to
see
him
.
*NL*
There
was
always
some
progress
,
but
he
could
never
be
told
what
sort
of
*NL*
progress
it
was
.
The
first
set
of
documents
to
be
submitted
were
being
*NL*
worked
on
but
still
not
ready
,
which
usually
turned
out
to
be
a
great
*NL*
advantage
the
next
time
K.
went
to
see
him
as
the
earlier
occasion
would
*NL*
have
been
a
very
bad
time
to
put
them
in
,
which
they
could
not
then
have
*NL*
known
.
If
K.
,
stupefied
from
all
this
talking
,
ever
pointed
out
that
*NL*
even
considering
all
these
difficulties
progress
was
very
slow
,
the
*NL*
lawyer
would
object
that
progress
was
not
slow
at
all
,
but
that
they
*NL*
might
have
progressed
far
further
if
K.
had
come
to
him
at
the
right
*NL*
time
.
But
he
had
come
to
him
late
and
that
lateness
would
bring
still
*NL*
further
difficulties
,
and
not
only
where
time
was
concerned
.
The
only
*NL*
welcome
interruption
during
these
visits
was
always
when
Leni
contrived
*NL*
to
bring
the
lawyer
his
tea
while
K.
was
there
.
Then
she
would
stand
*NL*
behind
K.
-
pretending
to
watch
the
lawyer
as
he
bent
greedily
over
his
*NL*
cup
,
poured
the
tea
in
and
drank
-
and
secretly
let
K.
hold
her
hand
.
*NL*
There
was
always
complete
silence
.
The
lawyer
drank
.
K.
squeezed
*NL*
Leni
's
hand
and
Leni
would
sometimes
dare
to
gently
stroke
K.
's
hair
.
*NL*
``
Still
here
,
are
you
?
''
the
lawyer
would
ask
when
he
was
ready
.
``
I
*NL*
wanted
to
take
the
dishes
away
,
''
said
Leni
,
they
would
give
each
other
's
*NL*
hands
a
final
squeeze
,
the
lawyer
would
wipe
his
mouth
and
then
start
*NL*
talking
at
K.
again
with
renewed
energy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
the
lawyer
trying
to
comfort
K.
or
to
confuse
him
?
K.
could
*NL*
not
tell
,
but
it
seemed
clear
to
him
that
his
defence
was
not
in
good
*NL*
hands
.
Maybe
everything
the
lawyer
said
was
quite
right
,
even
though
he
*NL*
obviously
wanted
to
make
himself
as
conspicuous
as
possible
and
probably
*NL*
had
never
even
taken
on
a
case
as
important
as
he
said
K.
's
was
.
But
it
*NL*
was
still
suspicious
how
he
continually
mentioned
his
personal
contacts
*NL*
with
the
civil
servants
.
Were
they
to
be
exploited
solely
for
K.
's
*NL*
benefit
?
The
lawyer
never
forgot
to
mention
that
they
were
dealing
only
*NL*
with
junior
officials
,
which
meant
officials
who
were
dependent
on
*NL*
others
,
and
the
direction
taken
in
each
trial
could
be
important
for
*NL*
their
own
furtherment
.
Could
it
be
that
they
were
making
use
of
the
*NL*
lawyer
to
turn
trials
in
a
certain
direction
,
which
would
,
of
course
,
*NL*
always
be
at
the
cost
of
the
defendant
?
It
certainly
did
not
mean
that
*NL*
they
would
do
that
in
every
trial
,
that
was
not
likely
at
all
,
and
there
*NL*
were
probably
also
trials
where
they
gave
the
lawyer
advantages
and
all
*NL*
the
room
he
needed
to
turn
it
in
the
direction
he
wanted
,
as
it
would
*NL*
also
be
to
their
advantage
to
keep
his
reputation
intact
.
If
that
*NL*
really
was
their
relationship
,
how
would
they
direct
K.
's
trial
which
,
*NL*
as
the
lawyer
had
explained
,
was
especially
difficult
and
therefore
*NL*
important
enough
to
attract
great
attention
from
the
very
first
time
it
*NL*
came
to
court
?
There
could
not
be
much
doubt
about
what
they
would
do
.
*NL*
The
first
signs
of
it
could
already
be
seen
in
the
fact
that
the
first
*NL*
documents
still
had
not
been
submitted
even
though
the
trial
had
already
*NL*
lasted
several
months
,
and
that
,
according
to
the
lawyer
,
everything
was
*NL*
still
in
its
initial
stages
,
which
was
very
effective
,
of
course
,
in
*NL*
making
the
defendant
passive
and
keeping
him
helpless
.
Then
he
could
be
*NL*
suddenly
surprised
with
the
verdict
,
or
at
least
with
a
notification
*NL*
that
the
hearing
had
not
decided
in
his
favour
and
the
matter
would
be
*NL*
passed
on
to
a
higher
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
essential
that
K.
take
a
hand
in
it
himself
.
On
winter
's
*NL*
mornings
such
as
this
,
when
he
was
very
tired
and
everything
dragged
*NL*
itself
lethargically
through
his
head
,
this
belief
of
his
seemed
*NL*
irrefutable
.
He
no
longer
felt
the
contempt
for
the
trial
that
he
had
*NL*
had
earlier
.
If
he
had
been
alone
in
the
world
it
would
have
been
easy
*NL*
for
him
to
ignore
it
,
although
it
was
also
certain
that
,
in
that
case
,
*NL*
the
trial
would
never
have
arisen
in
the
first
place
.
But
now
,
his
*NL*
uncle
had
already
dragged
him
to
see
the
lawyer
,
he
had
to
take
account
*NL*
of
his
family
;
his
job
was
no
longer
totally
separate
from
the
progress
*NL*
of
the
trial
,
he
himself
had
carelessly
-
with
a
certain
,
inexplicable
*NL*
complacency
-
mentioned
it
to
acquaintances
and
others
had
learned
about
*NL*
it
in
ways
he
did
not
know
,
his
relationship
with
Miss
Buerstner
seemed
*NL*
to
be
in
trouble
because
of
it
.
In
short
,
he
no
longer
had
any
choice
*NL*
whether
he
would
accept
the
trial
or
turn
it
down
,
he
was
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
it
and
had
to
defend
himself
.
If
he
was
tired
,
then
that
was
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
reason
to
worry
too
much
before
he
needed
to
.
He
*NL*
had
been
capable
of
working
himself
up
to
his
high
position
in
the
bank
*NL*
in
a
relatively
short
time
and
to
retain
it
with
respect
from
everyone
,
*NL*
now
he
simply
had
to
apply
some
of
the
talents
that
had
made
that
*NL*
possible
for
him
to
the
trial
,
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
it
had
to
*NL*
turn
out
well
.
The
most
important
thing
,
if
something
was
to
be
*NL*
achieved
,
was
to
reject
in
advance
any
idea
that
he
might
be
in
any
way
*NL*
guilty
.
There
was
no
guilt
.
The
trial
was
nothing
but
a
big
piece
of
*NL*
business
,
just
like
he
had
already
concluded
to
the
benefit
of
the
bank
*NL*
many
times
,
a
piece
of
business
that
concealed
many
lurking
dangers
*NL*
waiting
in
ambush
for
him
,
as
they
usually
did
,
and
these
dangers
would
*NL*
need
to
be
defended
against
.
If
that
was
to
be
achieved
then
he
must
*NL*
not
entertain
any
idea
of
guilt
,
whatever
he
did
,
he
would
need
to
look
*NL*
after
his
own
interests
as
closely
as
he
could
.
Seen
in
this
way
,
there
*NL*
was
no
choice
but
to
take
his
representation
away
from
the
lawyer
very
*NL*
soon
,
at
best
that
very
evening
.
The
lawyer
had
told
him
,
as
he
talked
*NL*
to
him
,
that
that
was
something
unheard
of
and
would
probably
do
him
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
harm
,
but
K.
could
not
tolerate
any
impediment
to
his
*NL*
efforts
where
his
trial
was
concerned
,
and
these
impediments
were
*NL*
probably
caused
by
the
lawyer
himself
.
But
once
he
had
shaken
off
the
*NL*
lawyer
the
documents
would
need
to
be
submitted
straight
away
and
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
he
would
need
to
see
to
it
that
they
were
being
dealt
with
*NL*
every
day
.
It
would
of
course
not
be
enough
,
if
that
was
to
be
done
,
*NL*
for
K.
to
sit
in
the
corridor
with
his
hat
under
the
bench
like
the
*NL*
others
.
Day
after
day
,
he
himself
,
or
one
of
the
women
or
somebody
else
*NL*
on
his
behalf
,
would
have
to
run
after
the
officials
and
force
them
to
*NL*
sit
at
their
desks
and
study
K.
's
documents
instead
of
looking
out
on
*NL*
the
corridor
through
the
grating
.
There
could
be
no
let-up
in
these
*NL*
efforts
,
everything
would
need
to
be
organised
and
supervised
,
it
was
*NL*
about
time
that
the
court
came
up
against
a
defendant
who
knew
how
to
*NL*
defend
and
make
use
of
his
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
K.
had
the
confidence
to
try
and
do
all
this
the
*NL*
difficulty
of
composing
the
documents
was
too
much
for
him
.
Earlier
,
*NL*
just
a
week
or
so
before
,
he
could
only
have
felt
shame
at
the
thought
*NL*
of
being
made
to
write
out
such
documents
himself
;
it
had
never
entered
*NL*
his
head
that
the
task
could
also
be
difficult
.
He
remembered
one
*NL*
morning
when
,
already
piled
up
with
work
,
he
suddenly
shoved
everything
*NL*
to
one
side
and
took
a
pad
of
paper
on
which
he
sketched
out
some
of
his
*NL*
thoughts
on
how
documents
of
this
sort
should
proceed
.
Perhaps
he
would
*NL*
offer
them
to
that
slow-witted
lawyer
,
but
just
then
the
door
of
the
*NL*
manager
's
office
opened
and
the
deputy-director
entered
the
room
with
a
*NL*
loud
laugh
.
K.
was
very
embarrassed
,
although
the
deputy-director
,
of
*NL*
course
,
was
not
laughing
at
K.
's
documents
,
which
he
knew
nothing
about
,
*NL*
but
at
a
joke
he
had
just
heard
about
the
stock-exchange
,
a
joke
which
*NL*
needed
an
illustration
if
it
was
to
be
understood
,
and
now
the
deputy
-
*NL*
director
leant
over
K.
's
desk
,
took
his
pencil
from
his
hand
,
and
drew
*NL*
the
illustration
on
the
writing
pad
that
K.
had
intended
for
his
ideas
*NL*
about
his
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
K.
now
had
no
more
thoughts
of
shame
,
the
documents
had
to
be
*NL*
prepared
and
submitted
.
If
,
as
was
very
likely
,
he
could
find
no
time
*NL*
to
do
it
in
the
office
he
would
have
to
do
it
at
home
at
night
.
If
the
*NL*
nights
were
n't
enough
he
would
have
to
take
a
holiday
.
Above
all
,
he
could
*NL*
not
stop
half
way
,
that
was
nonsense
not
only
in
business
but
always
and
*NL*
everywhere
.
Needless
to
say
,
the
documents
would
mean
an
almost
endless
*NL*
amount
of
work
.
It
was
easy
to
come
to
the
belief
,
not
only
for
those
*NL*
of
an
anxious
disposition
,
that
it
was
impossible
ever
to
finish
it
.
*NL*
This
was
not
because
of
laziness
or
deceit
,
which
were
the
only
things
*NL*
that
might
have
hindered
the
lawyer
in
preparing
it
,
but
because
he
did
*NL*
not
know
what
the
charge
was
or
even
what
consequences
it
might
bring
,
*NL*
so
that
he
had
to
remember
every
tiny
action
and
event
from
the
whole
of
*NL*
his
life
,
looking
at
them
from
all
sides
and
checking
and
reconsidering
*NL*
them
.
It
was
also
a
very
disheartening
job
.
It
would
have
been
more
*NL*
suitable
as
a
way
of
passing
the
long
days
after
he
had
retired
and
*NL*
become
senile
.
But
now
,
just
when
K.
needed
to
apply
all
his
thoughts
*NL*
to
his
work
,
when
he
was
still
rising
and
already
posed
a
threat
to
the
*NL*
deputy-director
,
when
every
hour
passed
so
quickly
and
he
wanted
to
*NL*
enjoy
the
brief
evenings
and
nights
as
a
young
man
,
this
was
the
time
he
*NL*
had
to
start
working
out
these
documents
.
Once
more
,
he
began
to
feel
*NL*
resentment
.
Almost
involuntarily
,
only
to
put
an
end
to
it
,
his
finger
*NL*
felt
for
the
button
of
the
electric
bell
in
the
ante-room
.
As
he
*NL*
pressed
it
he
glanced
up
to
the
clock
.
It
was
eleven
o'clock
,
two
*NL*
hours
,
he
had
spent
a
great
deal
of
his
costly
time
just
dreaming
and
*NL*
his
wits
were
,
of
course
,
even
more
dulled
than
they
had
been
before
.
*NL*
But
the
time
had
,
nonetheless
,
not
been
wasted
,
he
had
come
to
some
*NL*
decisions
that
could
be
of
value
.
As
well
as
various
pieces
of
mail
,
*NL*
the
servitors
brought
two
visiting
cards
from
gentlemen
who
had
already
*NL*
been
waiting
for
K.
for
some
time
.
They
were
actually
very
important
*NL*
clients
of
the
bank
who
should
not
really
have
been
kept
waiting
under
*NL*
any
circumstances
.
Why
had
they
come
at
such
an
awkward
time
,
and
why
,
*NL*
the
gentlemen
on
the
other
side
of
the
closed
door
seemed
to
be
asking
,
*NL*
was
the
industrious
K.
using
up
the
best
business
time
for
his
private
*NL*
affairs
?
Tired
from
what
had
gone
before
,
and
tired
in
anticipation
of
*NL*
what
was
to
follow
,
K.
stood
up
to
receive
the
first
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
short
,
jolly
man
,
a
manufacturer
who
K.
knew
well
.
He
*NL*
apologised
for
disturbing
K.
at
some
important
work
,
and
K.
,
for
his
*NL*
part
,
apologised
for
having
kept
the
manufacturer
waiting
for
so
long
.
*NL*
But
even
this
apology
was
spoken
in
such
a
mechanical
way
and
with
such
*NL*
false
intonation
that
the
manufacturer
would
certainly
have
noticed
if
*NL*
he
had
not
been
fully
preoccupied
with
his
business
affairs
.
Instead
,
*NL*
he
hurriedly
pulled
calculations
and
tables
out
from
all
his
pockets
,
*NL*
spread
them
out
in
front
of
K.
,
explained
several
items
,
corrected
a
*NL*
little
mistake
in
the
arithmetic
that
he
noticed
as
he
quickly
glanced
*NL*
over
it
all
,
and
reminded
K.
of
a
similar
piece
of
business
he
'd
*NL*
concluded
with
him
about
a
year
before
,
mentioning
in
passing
that
this
*NL*
time
there
was
another
bank
spending
great
effort
to
get
his
business
,
*NL*
and
finally
stopped
speaking
in
order
to
learn
K.
's
opinion
on
the
*NL*
matter
.
And
K.
had
indeed
,
at
first
,
been
closely
following
what
the
*NL*
manufacturer
was
saying
,
he
too
was
aware
of
how
important
the
deal
was
,
*NL*
but
unfortunately
it
did
not
last
,
he
soon
stopped
listening
,
nodded
at
*NL*
each
of
the
manufacturer
's
louder
exclamations
for
a
short
while
,
but
*NL*
eventually
he
stopped
doing
even
that
and
did
no
more
than
stare
at
the
*NL*
bald
head
bent
over
the
papers
,
asking
himself
when
the
manufacturer
*NL*
would
finally
realise
that
everything
he
was
saying
was
useless
.
When
*NL*
he
did
stop
talking
,
K.
really
thought
at
first
that
this
was
so
that
he
*NL*
would
have
the
chance
to
confess
that
he
was
incapable
of
listening
.
*NL*
Instead
,
seeing
the
anticipation
on
the
manufacturer
's
face
,
obviously
*NL*
ready
to
counter
any
objections
made
,
he
was
sorry
to
realise
that
the
*NL*
business
discussion
had
to
be
continued
.
So
he
bent
his
head
as
if
he
'd
*NL*
been
given
an
order
and
began
slowly
to
move
his
pencil
over
the
papers
,
*NL*
now
and
then
he
would
stop
and
stare
at
one
of
the
figures
.
The
*NL*
manufacturer
thought
there
must
be
some
objection
,
perhaps
his
figures
*NL*
were
n't
really
sound
,
perhaps
they
were
n't
the
decisive
issue
,
whatever
*NL*
he
thought
,
the
manufacturer
covered
the
papers
with
his
hand
and
began
*NL*
once
again
,
moving
very
close
to
K.
,
to
explain
what
the
deal
was
all
*NL*
about
.
``
It
is
difficult
,
''
said
K.
,
pursing
his
lips
.
The
only
thing
*NL*
that
could
offer
him
any
guidance
were
the
papers
,
and
the
manufacturer
*NL*
had
covered
them
from
his
view
,
so
he
just
sank
back
against
the
arm
of
*NL*
the
chair
.
Even
when
the
door
of
the
manager
's
office
opened
and
*NL*
revealed
not
very
clearly
,
as
if
through
a
veil
,
the
deputy
director
,
he
*NL*
did
no
more
than
look
up
weakly
.
K.
thought
no
more
about
the
matter
,
*NL*
he
merely
watched
the
immediate
effect
of
the
deputy
director
's
*NL*
appearance
and
,
for
him
,
the
effect
was
very
pleasing
;
the
manufacturer
*NL*
immediately
jumped
up
from
his
seat
and
hurried
over
to
meet
the
deputy
*NL*
director
,
although
K.
would
have
liked
to
make
him
ten
times
livelier
as
*NL*
he
feared
the
deputy
director
might
disappear
again
.
He
need
not
have
*NL*
worried
,
the
two
gentlemen
met
each
other
,
shook
each
other
's
hand
and
*NL*
went
together
over
to
K.
's
desk
.
The
manufacturer
said
he
was
sorry
to
*NL*
find
the
chief
clerk
so
little
inclined
to
do
business
,
pointing
to
K.
*NL*
who
,
under
the
view
of
the
deputy
director
,
had
bent
back
down
over
the
*NL*
papers
.
As
the
two
men
leant
over
the
desk
and
the
manufacturer
made
*NL*
some
effort
to
gain
and
keep
the
deputy
director
's
attention
,
K.
felt
as
*NL*
if
they
were
much
bigger
than
they
really
were
and
that
their
*NL*
negotiations
were
about
him
.
Carefully
and
slowly
turning
his
eyes
*NL*
upwards
,
he
tried
to
learn
what
was
taking
place
above
him
,
took
one
of
*NL*
the
papers
from
his
desk
without
looking
to
see
what
it
was
,
lay
it
on
*NL*
the
flat
of
his
hand
and
raised
it
slowly
up
as
he
rose
up
to
the
level
*NL*
of
the
two
men
himself
.
He
had
no
particular
plan
in
mind
as
he
did
*NL*
this
,
but
merely
felt
this
was
how
he
would
act
if
only
he
had
finished
*NL*
preparing
that
great
document
that
was
to
remove
his
burden
entirely
.
*NL*
The
deputy
director
had
been
paying
all
his
attention
to
the
*NL*
conversation
and
did
no
more
than
glance
at
the
paper
,
he
did
not
read
*NL*
what
was
written
on
it
at
all
as
what
was
important
for
the
chief
clerk
*NL*
was
not
important
for
him
,
he
took
it
from
K.
's
hand
saying
,
``
Thank
you
,
*NL*
I
'm
already
familiar
with
everything
''
,
and
lay
it
calmly
back
on
the
*NL*
desk
.
K.
gave
him
a
bitter
,
sideways
look
.
But
the
deputy
director
did
*NL*
not
notice
this
at
all
,
or
if
he
did
notice
it
it
only
raised
his
*NL*
spirits
,
he
frequently
laughed
out
loud
,
one
time
he
clearly
embarrassed
*NL*
the
manufacturer
when
he
raised
an
objection
in
a
witty
way
but
drew
him
*NL*
immediately
back
out
of
his
embarrassment
by
commenting
adversely
on
*NL*
himself
,
and
finally
invited
him
into
his
office
where
they
could
bring
*NL*
the
matter
to
its
conclusion
.
``
It
's
a
very
important
matter
,
''
said
the
*NL*
manufacturer
.
``
I
understand
that
completely
.
And
I
'm
sure
the
chief
*NL*
clerk
...
''
-
even
as
he
said
this
he
was
actually
speaking
only
to
the
*NL*
manufacturer
-
``
will
be
very
glad
to
have
us
take
it
off
his
hands
.
*NL*
This
is
something
that
needs
calm
consideration
.
But
he
seems
to
be
*NL*
over-burdened
today
,
there
are
even
some
people
in
the
room
outside
*NL*
who
've
been
waiting
there
for
hours
for
him
.
''
K.
still
had
enough
*NL*
control
of
himself
to
turn
away
from
the
deputy
director
and
direct
his
*NL*
friendly
,
albeit
stiff
,
smile
only
at
the
manufacturer
,
he
made
no
other
*NL*
retaliation
,
bent
down
slightly
and
supported
himself
with
both
hands
on
*NL*
his
desk
like
a
clerk
,
and
watched
as
the
two
gentlemen
,
still
talking
,
*NL*
took
the
papers
from
his
desk
and
disappeared
into
the
manager
's
office
.
*NL*
In
the
doorway
,
the
manufacturer
turned
and
said
he
would
n't
make
his
*NL*
farewell
with
K.
just
yet
,
he
would
of
course
let
the
chief
clerk
know
*NL*
about
the
success
of
his
discussions
but
he
also
had
a
little
something
*NL*
to
tell
him
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
K.
was
by
himself
.
It
did
not
enter
his
head
to
show
*NL*
anyone
else
into
his
office
and
only
became
vaguely
aware
of
how
nice
it
*NL*
was
that
the
people
outside
thought
he
was
still
negotiating
with
the
*NL*
manufacturer
and
,
for
this
reason
,
he
could
not
let
anyone
in
to
see
*NL*
him
,
not
even
the
servitor
.
He
went
over
to
the
window
,
sat
down
on
the
*NL*
ledge
beside
it
,
held
firmly
on
to
the
handle
and
looked
down
onto
the
*NL*
square
outside
.
The
snow
was
still
falling
,
the
weather
still
had
not
*NL*
brightened
up
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
a
long
time
sitting
in
this
way
,
not
knowing
what
it
*NL*
actually
was
that
made
him
so
anxious
,
only
occasionally
did
he
glance
,
*NL*
slightly
startled
,
over
his
shoulder
at
the
door
to
the
outer
room
*NL*
where
,
mistakenly
,
he
thought
he
'd
heard
some
noise
.
No-one
came
,
and
*NL*
that
made
him
feel
calmer
,
he
went
over
to
the
wash
stand
,
rinsed
his
*NL*
face
with
cold
water
and
,
his
head
somewhat
clearer
,
went
back
to
his
*NL*
place
by
the
window
.
The
decision
to
take
his
defence
into
his
own
*NL*
hands
now
seemed
more
of
a
burden
than
he
had
originally
assumed
.
All
*NL*
the
while
he
had
left
his
defence
up
to
the
lawyer
his
trial
had
had
*NL*
little
basic
affect
on
him
,
he
had
observed
it
from
afar
as
something
*NL*
that
was
scarcely
able
to
reach
him
directly
,
when
it
suited
him
he
*NL*
looked
to
see
how
things
stood
but
he
was
also
able
to
draw
his
head
*NL*
back
again
whenever
he
wanted
.
Now
,
in
contrast
,
if
he
was
to
conduct
*NL*
his
defence
himself
,
he
would
have
to
devote
himself
entirely
to
the
*NL*
court
-
for
the
time
being
,
at
least
-
success
would
mean
,
later
on
,
his
*NL*
complete
and
conclusive
liberation
,
but
if
he
was
to
achieve
this
he
*NL*
would
have
to
place
himself
,
to
start
with
,
in
far
greater
danger
than
*NL*
he
had
been
in
so
far
.
If
he
ever
felt
tempted
to
doubt
this
,
then
his
*NL*
experience
with
the
deputy
director
and
the
manufacturer
that
day
would
*NL*
be
quite
enough
to
convince
him
of
it
.
How
could
he
have
sat
there
*NL*
totally
convinced
of
the
need
to
do
his
own
defence
?
How
would
it
be
*NL*
later
?
What
would
his
life
be
like
in
the
days
ahead
?
Would
he
find
*NL*
the
way
through
it
all
to
a
happy
conclusion
?
Did
a
carefully
worked
*NL*
out
defence
-
and
any
other
sort
would
have
made
no
sense
-
did
a
*NL*
carefully
worked
out
defence
not
also
mean
he
would
need
to
shut
himself
*NL*
off
from
everything
else
as
much
as
he
could
?
Would
he
survive
that
?
*NL*
And
how
was
he
to
succeed
in
conducting
all
this
at
the
bank
?
It
*NL*
involved
much
more
than
just
submitting
some
documents
that
he
could
*NL*
probably
prepare
in
a
few
days
'
leave
,
although
it
would
have
been
great
*NL*
temerity
to
ask
for
time
off
from
the
bank
just
at
that
time
,
it
was
a
*NL*
whole
trial
and
there
was
no
way
of
seeing
how
long
it
might
last
.
This
*NL*
was
an
enormous
difficulty
that
had
suddenly
been
thrown
into
K.
's
life
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
was
he
supposed
to
be
doing
the
bank
's
work
at
a
time
like
*NL*
this
?
He
looked
down
at
his
desk
.
Was
he
supposed
to
let
people
in
to
*NL*
see
him
and
go
into
negotiations
with
them
at
a
time
like
this
?
While
*NL*
his
trial
trundled
on
,
while
the
court
officials
upstairs
in
the
attic
*NL*
room
sat
looking
at
the
papers
for
this
trial
,
should
he
be
worrying
*NL*
about
the
business
of
the
bank
?
Did
this
not
seem
like
a
kind
of
*NL*
torture
,
acknowledged
by
the
court
,
connected
with
the
trial
and
which
*NL*
followed
him
around
?
And
is
it
likely
that
anyone
in
the
bank
,
when
*NL*
judging
his
work
,
would
take
any
account
of
his
peculiar
situation
?
No
-
*NL*
one
and
never
.
There
were
those
who
knew
about
his
trial
,
although
it
*NL*
was
not
quite
clear
who
knew
about
it
or
how
much
.
But
he
hoped
rumours
*NL*
had
not
reached
as
far
as
the
deputy
director
,
otherwise
he
would
*NL*
obviously
soon
find
a
way
of
making
use
of
it
to
harm
K.
,
he
would
show
*NL*
neither
comradeship
nor
humaneness
.
And
what
about
the
director
?
It
*NL*
was
true
that
he
was
well
disposed
towards
K.
,
and
as
soon
as
he
heard
*NL*
about
the
trial
he
would
probably
try
to
do
everything
he
could
to
make
*NL*
it
easier
for
him
,
but
he
would
certainly
not
devote
himself
to
it
.
K.
*NL*
at
one
time
had
provided
the
counter-balance
to
what
the
deputy
director
*NL*
said
but
the
director
was
now
coming
more
and
more
under
his
influence
,
*NL*
and
the
deputy
director
would
also
exploit
the
weakened
condition
of
the
*NL*
director
to
strengthen
his
own
power
.
So
what
could
K.
hope
for
?
Maybe
*NL*
considerations
of
this
sort
weakened
his
power
of
resistance
,
but
it
was
*NL*
still
necessary
not
to
deceive
oneself
and
to
see
everything
as
clearly
*NL*
as
it
could
be
seen
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
no
particular
reason
,
just
to
avoiding
returning
to
his
desk
*NL*
for
a
while
,
he
opened
the
window
.
It
was
difficult
to
open
and
he
had
*NL*
to
turn
the
handle
with
both
his
hands
.
Then
,
through
the
whole
height
*NL*
and
breadth
of
the
window
,
the
mixture
of
fog
and
smoke
was
drawn
into
*NL*
the
room
,
filling
it
with
a
slight
smell
of
burning
.
A
few
flakes
of
*NL*
snow
were
blown
in
with
it
.
``
It
's
a
horrible
autumn
,
''
said
the
*NL*
manufacturer
,
who
had
come
into
the
room
unnoticed
after
seeing
the
*NL*
deputy
director
and
now
stood
behind
K.
K.
nodded
and
looked
uneasily
*NL*
at
the
manufacturer
's
briefcase
,
from
which
he
would
now
probably
take
*NL*
the
papers
and
inform
K.
of
the
result
of
his
negotiations
with
the
*NL*
deputy
director
.
However
,
the
manufacturer
saw
where
K.
was
looking
,
*NL*
knocked
on
his
briefcase
and
without
opening
it
said
,
``
You
'll
be
wanting
*NL*
to
hear
how
things
turned
out
.
I
've
already
got
the
contract
in
my
*NL*
pocket
,
almost
.
He
's
a
charming
man
,
your
deputy
director
-
he
's
got
*NL*
his
dangers
,
though
.
''
He
laughed
as
he
shook
K.
's
hand
and
wanted
to
*NL*
make
him
laugh
with
him
.
But
to
K.
,
it
once
more
seemed
suspicious
that
*NL*
the
manufacturer
did
not
want
to
show
him
the
papers
and
saw
nothing
*NL*
about
his
comments
to
laugh
at
.
``
Chief
clerk
,
''
said
the
manufacturer
,
*NL*
``
I
expect
the
weather
's
been
affecting
your
mood
,
has
it
?
You
're
looking
*NL*
so
worried
today
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
K.
,
raising
his
hand
and
holding
the
*NL*
temple
of
his
head
,
``
headaches
,
worries
in
the
family
.
''
``
Quite
right
,
''
*NL*
said
the
manufacturer
,
who
was
always
in
a
hurry
and
could
never
listen
*NL*
to
anyone
for
very
long
,
``
everyone
has
his
cross
to
bear
.
''
K.
had
*NL*
unconsciously
made
a
step
towards
the
door
as
if
wanting
to
show
the
*NL*
manufacturer
out
,
but
the
manufacturer
said
,
``
Chief
clerk
,
there
's
*NL*
something
else
I
'd
like
to
mention
to
you
.
I
'm
very
sorry
if
it
's
*NL*
something
that
'll
be
a
burden
to
you
today
of
all
days
but
I
've
been
to
*NL*
see
you
twice
already
,
lately
,
and
each
time
I
forgot
all
about
it
.
If
*NL*
I
delay
it
any
longer
it
might
well
lose
its
point
altogether
.
That
*NL*
would
be
a
pity
,
as
I
think
what
I
've
got
to
say
does
have
some
value
.
''
*NL*
Before
K.
had
had
the
time
to
answer
,
the
manufacturer
came
up
close
to
*NL*
him
,
tapped
his
knuckle
lightly
on
his
chest
and
said
quietly
,
``
You
've
*NL*
got
a
trial
going
on
,
have
n't
you
?
''
K.
stepped
back
and
immediately
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
That
's
what
the
deputy
director
's
been
telling
you
!
''
``
No
,
*NL*
no
,
''
said
the
manufacturer
,
``
how
would
the
deputy
director
know
about
*NL*
it
?
''
``
And
what
about
you
?
''
asked
K.
,
already
more
in
control
of
*NL*
himself
.
``
I
hear
things
about
the
court
here
and
there
,
''
said
the
*NL*
manufacturer
,
``
and
that
even
applies
to
what
it
is
that
I
wanted
to
tell
*NL*
you
about
.
''
``
There
are
so
many
people
who
have
connections
with
the
*NL*
court
!
''
said
K.
with
lowered
head
,
and
he
led
the
manufacturer
over
to
*NL*
his
desk
.
They
sat
down
where
they
had
been
before
,
and
the
*NL*
manufacturer
said
,
``
I
'm
afraid
it
's
not
very
much
that
I
've
got
to
tell
*NL*
you
about
.
Only
,
in
matters
like
this
,
it
's
best
not
to
overlook
the
*NL*
tiniest
details
.
Besides
,
I
really
want
to
help
you
in
some
way
,
*NL*
however
modest
my
help
might
be
.
We
've
been
good
business
partners
up
*NL*
till
now
,
have
n't
we
?
Well
then
.
''
K.
wanted
to
apologise
for
his
*NL*
behaviour
in
the
conversation
earlier
that
day
,
but
the
manufacturer
*NL*
would
tolerate
no
interruption
,
shoved
his
briefcase
up
high
in
his
*NL*
armpit
to
show
that
he
was
in
a
hurry
,
and
carried
on
.
``
I
know
about
*NL*
your
case
through
a
certain
Titorelli
.
He
's
a
painter
,
Titorelli
's
just
*NL*
his
artistic
name
,
I
do
n't
even
know
what
his
real
name
is
.
He
's
been
*NL*
coming
to
me
in
my
office
for
years
from
time
to
time
,
and
brings
little
*NL*
pictures
with
him
which
I
buy
more
or
less
just
for
the
sake
of
charity
*NL*
as
he
's
hardly
more
than
a
beggar
.
And
they
're
nice
pictures
,
too
,
*NL*
moorland
landscapes
and
that
sort
of
thing
.
We
'd
both
got
used
to
doing
*NL*
business
in
this
way
and
it
always
went
smoothly
.
Only
,
one
time
these
*NL*
visits
became
a
bit
too
frequent
,
I
began
to
tell
him
off
for
it
,
we
*NL*
started
talking
and
I
became
interested
how
it
was
that
he
could
earn
a
*NL*
living
just
by
painting
,
and
then
I
learned
to
my
amazement
that
his
*NL*
main
source
of
income
was
painting
portraits
.
'
I
work
for
the
court
,
'
*NL*
he
said
,
`
what
court
?
'
said
I.
And
that
's
when
he
told
me
about
the
*NL*
court
.
I
'm
sure
you
can
imagine
how
amazed
I
was
at
being
told
all
*NL*
this
.
Ever
since
then
I
learn
something
new
about
the
court
every
time
*NL*
he
comes
to
visit
,
and
so
little
by
little
I
get
to
understand
something
*NL*
of
how
it
works
.
Anyway
,
Titorelli
talks
a
lot
and
I
often
have
to
push
*NL*
him
away
,
not
only
because
he
's
bound
to
be
lying
but
also
,
most
of
all
,
*NL*
because
a
businessman
like
me
who
's
already
close
to
breaking
point
*NL*
under
the
weight
of
his
own
business
worries
ca
n't
pay
too
much
*NL*
attention
to
other
people
's
.
But
all
that
's
just
by
the
by
.
Perhaps
-
*NL*
this
is
what
I
've
been
thinking
-
perhaps
Titorelli
might
be
able
to
*NL*
help
you
in
some
small
way
,
he
knows
lots
of
judges
and
even
if
he
ca
n't
*NL*
have
much
influence
himself
he
can
give
you
some
advice
about
how
to
get
*NL*
some
influential
people
on
your
side
.
And
even
if
this
advice
does
n't
*NL*
turn
out
to
make
all
the
difference
I
still
think
it
'll
be
very
*NL*
important
once
you
've
got
it
.
You
're
nearly
a
lawyer
yourself
.
That
's
*NL*
what
I
always
say
,
Mr.
K.
the
chief
clerk
is
nearly
a
lawyer
.
Oh
I
'm
*NL*
sure
this
trial
of
yours
will
turn
out
all
right
.
So
do
you
want
to
go
*NL*
and
see
Titorelli
,
then
?
If
I
ask
him
to
he
'll
certainly
do
everything
*NL*
he
possibly
can
.
I
really
do
think
you
ought
to
go
.
It
need
n't
be
*NL*
today
,
of
course
,
just
some
time
,
when
you
get
the
chance
.
And
anyway
-
*NL*
I
want
to
tell
you
this
too
-
you
do
n't
actually
have
to
go
and
see
*NL*
Titorelli
,
this
advice
from
me
does
n't
place
you
under
any
obligation
at
*NL*
all
.
No
,
if
you
think
you
can
get
by
without
Titorelli
it
'll
certainly
*NL*
be
better
to
leave
him
completely
out
of
it
.
Maybe
you
've
already
got
a
*NL*
clear
idea
of
what
you
're
doing
and
Titorelli
could
upset
your
plans
.
*NL*
No
,
if
that
's
the
case
then
of
course
you
should
n't
go
there
under
any
*NL*
circumstances
!
And
it
certainly
wo
n't
be
easy
to
take
advice
from
a
lad
*NL*
like
that
.
Still
,
it
's
up
to
you
.
Here
's
the
letter
of
recommendation
*NL*
and
here
's
the
address
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Disappointed
,
K.
took
the
letter
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
Even
*NL*
at
best
,
the
advantage
he
might
derive
from
this
recommendation
was
*NL*
incomparably
smaller
than
the
damage
that
lay
in
the
fact
of
the
*NL*
manufacturer
knowing
about
his
trial
,
and
that
the
painter
was
spreading
*NL*
the
news
about
.
It
was
all
he
could
manage
to
give
the
manufacturer
,
who
*NL*
was
already
on
his
way
to
the
door
,
a
few
words
of
thanks
.
``
I
'll
go
*NL*
there
,
''
he
said
as
he
took
his
leave
of
the
manufacturer
at
the
door
,
*NL*
``
or
,
as
I
'm
very
busy
at
present
,
I
'll
write
to
him
,
perhaps
he
would
*NL*
like
to
come
to
me
in
my
office
some
time
.
''
``
I
was
sure
you
'd
find
the
*NL*
best
solution
,
''
said
the
manufacturer
.
``
Although
I
had
thought
you
'd
*NL*
prefer
to
avoid
inviting
people
like
this
Titorelli
to
the
bank
and
*NL*
talking
about
the
trial
here
.
And
it
's
not
always
a
good
idea
to
send
*NL*
letters
to
people
like
Titorelli
,
you
do
n't
know
what
might
happen
to
*NL*
them
.
But
you
're
bound
to
have
thought
everything
through
and
you
know
*NL*
what
you
can
and
ca
n't
do
.
''
K.
nodded
and
accompanied
the
manufacturer
*NL*
on
through
the
ante-room
.
But
despite
seeming
calm
on
the
outside
he
*NL*
was
actually
very
shocked
;
he
had
told
the
manufacturer
he
would
write
*NL*
to
Titorelli
only
to
show
him
in
some
way
that
he
valued
his
*NL*
recommendations
and
would
consider
the
opportunity
to
speak
with
*NL*
Titorelli
without
delay
,
but
if
he
had
thought
Titorelli
could
offer
any
*NL*
worthwhile
assistance
he
would
not
have
delayed
.
But
it
was
only
the
*NL*
manufacturer
's
comment
that
made
K.
realise
what
dangers
that
could
lead
*NL*
to
.
Was
he
really
able
to
rely
on
his
own
understanding
so
little
?
If
*NL*
it
was
possible
that
he
might
invite
a
questionable
character
into
the
*NL*
bank
with
a
clear
letter
,
and
ask
advice
from
him
about
his
trial
,
*NL*
separated
from
the
deputy
director
by
no
more
than
a
door
,
was
it
not
*NL*
possible
or
even
very
likely
that
there
were
also
other
dangers
he
had
*NL*
failed
to
see
or
that
he
was
even
running
towards
?
There
was
not
always
*NL*
someone
beside
him
to
warn
him
.
And
just
now
,
just
when
he
would
have
*NL*
to
act
with
all
the
strength
he
could
muster
,
now
a
number
of
doubts
of
*NL*
a
sort
he
had
never
before
known
had
presented
themselves
and
affected
*NL*
his
own
vigilance
!
The
difficulties
he
had
been
feeling
in
carrying
out
*NL*
his
office
work
;
were
they
now
going
to
affect
the
trial
too
?
Now
,
at
*NL*
least
,
he
found
himself
quite
unable
to
understand
how
he
could
have
*NL*
intended
to
write
to
Titorelli
and
invite
him
into
the
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
at
the
thought
of
it
once
more
as
the
servitor
*NL*
came
up
beside
him
and
drew
his
attention
to
the
three
gentlemen
who
*NL*
were
waiting
on
a
bench
in
the
ante-room
.
They
had
already
been
waiting
*NL*
to
see
K.
for
a
long
time
.
Now
that
the
servitor
was
speaking
with
K.
*NL*
they
had
stood
up
and
each
of
them
wanted
to
make
use
of
the
opportunity
*NL*
to
see
K.
before
the
others
.
It
had
been
negligent
of
the
bank
to
let
*NL*
them
waste
their
time
here
in
the
waiting
room
,
but
none
of
them
wanted
*NL*
to
draw
attention
to
this
.
``
Mr.
K.
,
...
''
one
of
them
was
saying
,
but
K.
*NL*
had
told
the
servitor
to
fetch
his
winter
coat
and
said
to
the
three
of
*NL*
them
,
as
the
servitor
helped
him
to
put
it
on
,
``
Please
forgive
me
,
*NL*
gentlemen
,
I
'm
afraid
I
have
no
time
to
see
you
at
present
.
Please
do
*NL*
forgive
me
but
I
have
some
urgent
business
to
settle
and
have
to
leave
*NL*
straight
away
.
You
've
already
seen
yourselves
how
long
I
've
been
*NL*
delayed
.
Would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
come
back
tomorrow
or
some
time
?
*NL*
Or
perhaps
we
could
settle
your
affairs
by
telephone
?
Or
perhaps
you
*NL*
would
like
to
tell
me
now
,
briefly
,
what
it
's
about
and
I
can
then
give
*NL*
you
a
full
answer
in
writing
.
Whatever
,
the
best
thing
will
be
for
you
*NL*
to
come
here
again
.
''
The
gentlemen
now
saw
that
their
wait
had
been
*NL*
totally
pointless
,
and
these
suggestions
of
K.
's
left
them
so
astounded
*NL*
that
they
looked
at
each
other
without
a
word
.
``
That
's
agreed
then
,
is
*NL*
it
?
''
asked
K.
,
who
had
turned
toward
the
servitor
bringing
him
his
hat
.
*NL*
Through
the
open
door
of
K.
's
office
they
could
see
that
the
snowfall
*NL*
outside
had
become
much
heavier
.
So
K.
turned
the
collar
of
his
coat
up
*NL*
and
buttoned
it
up
high
under
his
chin
.
Just
then
the
deputy
director
*NL*
came
out
of
the
adjoining
room
,
smiled
as
he
saw
K.
negotiating
with
the
*NL*
gentlemen
in
his
winter
coat
,
and
asked
,
``
Are
you
about
to
go
out
?
''
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
K.
,
standing
more
upright
,
``
I
have
to
go
out
on
some
*NL*
business
.
''
But
the
deputy
director
had
already
turned
towards
the
*NL*
gentlemen
.
``
And
what
about
these
gentlemen
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
think
*NL*
they
've
already
been
waiting
quite
a
long
time
.
''
``
We
've
already
come
to
*NL*
an
understanding
,
''
said
K
.
But
now
the
gentlemen
could
be
held
back
no
*NL*
longer
,
they
surrounded
K.
and
explained
that
they
would
not
have
been
*NL*
waiting
for
hours
if
it
had
not
been
about
something
important
that
had
*NL*
to
be
discussed
now
,
at
length
and
in
private
.
The
deputy
director
*NL*
listened
to
them
for
a
short
while
,
he
also
looked
at
K.
as
he
held
his
*NL*
hat
in
his
hand
cleaning
the
dust
off
it
here
and
there
,
and
then
he
*NL*
said
,
``
Gentlemen
,
there
is
a
very
simple
way
to
solve
this
.
If
you
*NL*
would
prefer
it
,
I
'll
be
very
glad
to
take
over
these
negotiations
*NL*
instead
of
the
chief
clerk
.
Your
business
does
,
of
course
,
need
to
be
*NL*
discussed
without
delay
.
We
are
businessmen
like
yourselves
and
know
*NL*
the
value
of
a
businessman
's
time
.
Would
you
like
to
come
this
way
?
''
*NL*
And
he
opened
the
door
leading
to
the
ante-room
of
his
own
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deputy
director
seemed
very
good
at
appropriating
everything
*NL*
that
K.
was
now
forced
to
give
up
!
But
was
K.
not
giving
up
more
than
*NL*
he
absolutely
had
to
?
By
running
off
to
some
unknown
painter
,
with
,
as
*NL*
he
had
to
admit
,
very
little
hope
of
any
vague
benefit
,
his
renown
was
*NL*
suffering
damage
that
could
not
me
repaired
.
It
would
probably
be
much
*NL*
better
to
take
off
his
winter
coat
again
and
,
at
the
very
least
,
try
to
*NL*
win
back
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
certainly
still
waiting
in
the
next
*NL*
room
.
If
K.
had
not
then
glimpsed
the
deputy
director
in
his
office
,
*NL*
looking
for
something
from
his
bookshelves
as
if
they
were
his
own
,
he
*NL*
would
probably
even
have
made
the
attempt
.
As
K.
,
somewhat
agitated
,
*NL*
approached
the
door
the
deputy
director
called
out
,
``
Oh
,
you
've
still
*NL*
not
left
!
''
He
turned
his
face
toward
him
-
its
many
deep
folds
seemed
*NL*
to
show
strength
rather
than
age
-
and
immediately
began
once
more
to
*NL*
search
.
``
I
'm
looking
for
a
copy
of
a
contract
,
''
he
said
,
``
which
this
*NL*
gentleman
insists
you
must
have
.
Could
you
help
me
look
for
it
,
do
you
*NL*
think
?
''
K.
made
a
step
forward
,
but
the
deputy
director
said
,
``
thank
*NL*
you
,
I
've
already
found
it
,
''
and
with
a
big
package
of
papers
,
which
*NL*
certainly
must
have
included
many
more
documents
than
just
the
copy
of
*NL*
the
contract
,
he
turned
and
went
back
into
his
own
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
deal
with
him
right
now
,
''
K.
said
to
himself
,
``
but
once
*NL*
my
personal
difficulties
have
been
settled
,
then
he
'll
certainly
be
the
*NL*
first
to
get
the
effect
of
it
,
and
he
certainly
wo
n't
like
it
.
''
*NL*
Slightly
calmed
by
these
thoughts
,
K.
gave
the
servitor
,
who
had
already
*NL*
long
been
holding
the
door
to
the
corridor
open
for
him
,
the
task
of
*NL*
telling
the
director
,
when
he
was
able
,
that
K.
was
going
out
of
the
*NL*
bank
on
a
business
matter
.
As
he
left
the
bank
he
felt
almost
happy
at
*NL*
the
thought
of
being
able
to
devote
more
of
himself
to
his
own
business
*NL*
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
straight
to
the
painter
,
who
lived
in
an
outlying
part
of
*NL*
town
which
was
very
near
to
the
court
offices
,
although
this
area
was
*NL*
even
poorer
,
the
houses
were
darker
,
the
streets
were
full
of
dirt
that
*NL*
slowly
blew
about
over
the
half-melted
snow
.
In
the
great
gateway
to
*NL*
the
building
where
the
painter
lived
only
one
of
the
two
doors
was
open
,
*NL*
a
hole
had
been
broken
open
in
the
wall
by
the
other
door
,
and
as
K.
*NL*
approached
it
a
repulsive
,
yellow
,
steaming
liquid
shot
out
causing
some
*NL*
rats
to
scurry
away
into
the
nearby
canal
.
Down
by
the
staircase
there
*NL*
was
a
small
child
lying
on
its
belly
crying
,
but
it
could
hardly
be
*NL*
heard
because
of
the
noise
from
a
metal-workshop
on
the
other
side
of
*NL*
the
entrance
hall
,
drowning
out
any
other
sound
.
The
door
to
the
*NL*
workshop
was
open
,
three
workers
stood
in
a
circle
around
some
piece
of
*NL*
work
that
they
were
beating
with
hammers
.
A
large
tin
plate
hung
on
the
*NL*
wall
,
casting
a
pale
light
that
pushed
its
way
in
between
two
of
the
*NL*
workers
,
lighting
up
their
faces
and
their
work-aprons
.
K.
did
no
more
*NL*
than
glance
at
any
of
these
things
,
he
wanted
to
get
things
over
with
*NL*
here
as
soon
as
possible
,
to
exchange
just
a
few
words
to
find
out
how
*NL*
things
stood
with
the
painter
and
go
straight
back
to
the
bank
.
Even
if
*NL*
he
had
just
some
tiny
success
here
it
would
still
have
a
good
effect
on
*NL*
his
work
at
the
bank
for
that
day
.
On
the
third
floor
he
had
to
slow
*NL*
down
his
pace
,
he
was
quite
out
of
breath
-
the
steps
,
just
like
the
*NL*
height
of
each
floor
,
were
much
higher
than
they
needed
to
be
and
he
'd
*NL*
been
told
that
the
painter
lived
right
up
in
the
attic
.
The
air
was
*NL*
also
quite
oppressive
,
there
was
no
proper
stairwell
and
the
narrow
*NL*
steps
were
closed
in
by
walls
on
both
sides
with
no
more
than
a
small
,
*NL*
high
window
here
and
there
.
Just
as
K.
paused
for
a
while
some
young
*NL*
girls
ran
out
of
one
of
the
flats
and
rushed
higher
up
the
stairs
,
*NL*
laughing
.
K.
followed
them
slowly
,
caught
up
with
one
of
the
girls
who
*NL*
had
stumbled
and
been
left
behind
by
the
others
,
and
asked
her
as
they
*NL*
went
up
side
by
side
,
``
Is
there
a
painter
,
Titorelli
,
who
lives
here
?
''
*NL*
The
girl
,
hardly
thirteen
years
old
and
somewhat
hunchbacked
,
jabbed
him
*NL*
with
her
elbow
and
looked
at
him
sideways
.
Her
youth
and
her
bodily
*NL*
defects
had
done
nothing
to
stop
her
being
already
quite
depraved
.
She
*NL*
did
not
smile
once
,
but
looked
at
K.
earnestly
,
with
sharp
,
acquisitive
*NL*
eyes
.
K.
pretended
not
to
notice
her
behaviour
and
asked
,
``
Do
you
know
*NL*
Titorelli
,
the
painter
?
''
She
nodded
and
asked
in
reply
,
``
What
d'you
*NL*
want
to
see
him
for
?
''
K.
thought
it
would
be
to
his
advantage
quickly
*NL*
to
find
out
something
more
about
Titorelli
.
``
I
want
to
have
him
paint
*NL*
my
portrait
,
''
he
said
.
``
Paint
your
portrait
?
''
she
asked
,
opening
her
*NL*
mouth
too
wide
and
lightly
hitting
K.
with
her
hand
as
if
he
had
said
*NL*
something
extraordinarily
surprising
or
clumsy
,
with
both
hands
she
*NL*
lifted
her
skirt
,
which
was
already
very
short
,
and
,
as
fast
as
she
*NL*
could
,
she
ran
off
after
the
other
girls
whose
indistinct
shouts
lost
*NL*
themselves
in
the
heights
.
At
the
next
turn
of
the
stairs
,
however
,
K.
*NL*
encountered
all
the
girls
once
more
.
The
hunchbacked
girl
had
clearly
*NL*
told
them
about
K.
's
intentions
and
they
were
waiting
for
him
.
They
*NL*
stood
on
both
sides
of
the
stairs
,
pressing
themselves
against
the
wall
*NL*
so
that
K.
could
get
through
between
them
,
and
smoothed
their
aprons
*NL*
down
with
their
hands
.
All
their
faces
,
even
in
this
guard
of
honour
,
*NL*
showed
a
mixture
of
childishness
and
depravity
.
Up
at
the
head
of
the
*NL*
line
of
girls
,
who
now
,
laughing
,
began
to
close
in
around
K.
,
was
the
*NL*
hunchback
who
had
taken
on
the
role
of
leader
.
It
was
thanks
to
her
*NL*
that
K.
found
the
right
direction
without
delay
-
he
would
have
*NL*
continued
up
the
stairs
straight
in
front
of
him
,
but
she
showed
him
*NL*
that
to
reach
Titorelli
he
would
need
to
turn
off
to
one
side
.
*NL*
The
steps
that
led
up
to
the
painter
were
especially
narrow
,
very
long
*NL*
without
any
turning
,
the
whole
length
could
be
seen
in
one
glance
and
,
*NL*
at
the
top
,
at
Titorelli
's
closed
door
,
it
came
to
its
end
.
This
door
*NL*
was
much
better
illuminated
than
the
rest
of
the
stairway
by
the
light
*NL*
from
a
small
skylight
set
obliquely
above
it
,
it
had
been
put
together
*NL*
from
unpainted
planks
of
wood
and
the
name
`
Titorelli
'
was
painted
on
it
*NL*
in
broad
,
red
brushstrokes
.
K.
was
no
more
than
half
way
up
the
steps
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
his
retinue
of
girls
,
when
,
clearly
the
result
of
the
*NL*
noise
of
all
those
footsteps
,
the
door
opened
slightly
and
in
the
crack
*NL*
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
dressed
in
just
his
nightshirt
appeared
.
``
Oh
!
''
*NL*
he
cried
,
when
he
saw
the
approaching
crowd
,
and
vanished
.
The
*NL*
hunchbacked
girl
clapped
her
hands
in
glee
and
the
other
girls
crowded
*NL*
in
behind
K.
to
push
him
faster
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
still
had
not
arrived
at
the
top
,
however
,
when
the
painter
*NL*
up
above
them
suddenly
pulled
the
door
wide
open
and
,
with
a
deep
bow
,
*NL*
invited
K.
to
enter
.
The
girls
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
tried
to
keep
*NL*
away
,
he
did
not
want
to
let
any
of
them
in
however
much
they
begged
him
*NL*
and
however
much
they
tried
to
get
in
-
if
they
could
not
get
in
with
*NL*
his
permission
they
would
try
to
force
their
way
in
against
his
will
.
*NL*
The
only
one
to
succeed
was
the
hunchback
when
she
slipped
through
under
*NL*
his
outstretched
arm
,
but
the
painter
chased
after
her
,
grabbed
her
by
*NL*
the
skirt
,
span
her
once
round
and
set
her
down
again
by
the
door
with
*NL*
the
other
girls
who
,
unlike
the
first
,
had
not
dared
to
cross
the
*NL*
doorstep
while
the
painter
had
left
his
post
.
K.
did
not
know
what
he
*NL*
was
to
make
of
all
this
,
as
they
all
seemed
to
be
having
fun
.
One
*NL*
behind
the
other
,
the
girls
by
the
door
stretched
their
necks
up
high
*NL*
and
called
out
various
words
to
the
painter
which
were
meant
in
jest
but
*NL*
which
K.
did
not
understand
,
and
even
the
painter
laughed
as
the
*NL*
hunchback
whirled
round
in
his
hand
.
Then
he
shut
the
door
,
bowed
once
*NL*
more
to
K.
,
offered
him
his
hand
and
introduced
himself
,
saying
,
*NL*
``
Titorelli
,
painter
''
.
K.
pointed
to
the
door
,
behind
which
the
girls
*NL*
were
whispering
,
and
said
,
``
You
seem
to
be
very
popular
in
this
*NL*
building
.
''
``
Ach
,
those
brats
!
''
said
the
painter
,
trying
in
vain
to
*NL*
fasten
his
nightshirt
at
the
neck
.
He
was
also
bare-footed
and
,
apart
*NL*
from
that
,
was
wearing
nothing
more
than
a
loose
pair
of
yellowish
linen
*NL*
trousers
held
up
with
a
belt
whose
free
end
whipped
to
and
fro
.
``
Those
*NL*
kids
are
a
real
burden
for
me
,
''
he
continued
.
The
top
button
of
his
*NL*
nightshirt
came
off
and
he
gave
up
trying
to
fasten
it
,
fetched
a
chair
*NL*
for
K.
and
made
him
sit
down
on
it
.
``
I
painted
one
of
them
once
-
she
's
*NL*
not
here
today
-
and
ever
since
then
they
've
been
following
me
about
.
*NL*
If
I
'm
here
they
only
come
in
when
I
allow
it
,
but
as
soon
as
I
've
gone
*NL*
out
there
's
always
at
least
one
of
them
in
here
.
They
had
a
key
made
to
*NL*
my
door
and
lend
it
round
to
each
other
.
It
's
hard
to
imagine
what
a
*NL*
pain
that
is
.
Suppose
I
come
back
home
with
a
lady
I
'm
going
to
paint
,
*NL*
I
open
the
door
with
my
own
key
and
find
the
hunchback
there
or
*NL*
something
,
by
the
table
painting
her
lips
red
with
my
paintbrush
,
and
*NL*
meanwhile
her
little
sisters
will
be
keeping
guard
for
her
,
moving
about
*NL*
and
causing
chaos
in
every
corner
of
the
room
.
Or
else
,
like
happened
*NL*
yesterday
,
I
might
come
back
home
late
in
the
evening
-
please
forgive
*NL*
my
appearance
and
the
room
being
in
a
mess
,
it
is
to
do
with
them
-
so
,
*NL*
I
might
come
home
late
in
the
evening
and
want
to
go
to
bed
,
then
I
feel
*NL*
something
pinching
my
leg
,
look
under
the
bed
and
pull
another
of
them
*NL*
out
from
under
it
.
I
do
n't
know
why
it
is
they
bother
me
like
this
,
I
*NL*
expect
you
've
just
seen
that
I
do
nothing
to
encourage
them
to
come
near
*NL*
me
.
And
they
make
it
hard
for
me
to
do
my
work
too
,
of
course
.
If
I
*NL*
did
n't
get
this
studio
for
nothing
I
'd
have
moved
out
a
long
time
ago
.
''
*NL*
Just
then
,
a
little
voice
,
tender
and
anxious
,
called
out
from
under
the
*NL*
door
,
``
Titorelli
,
can
we
come
in
now
?
''
``
No
,
''
answered
the
painter
.
*NL*
``
Not
even
just
me
,
by
myself
?
''
the
voice
asked
again
.
``
Not
even
just
*NL*
you
,
''
said
the
painter
,
as
he
went
to
the
door
and
locked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
K.
had
been
looking
round
the
room
,
if
it
had
not
been
*NL*
pointed
out
it
would
never
have
occurred
to
him
that
this
wretched
*NL*
little
room
could
be
called
a
studio
.
It
was
hardly
long
enough
or
*NL*
broad
enough
to
make
two
steps
.
Everything
,
floor
,
walls
and
ceiling
,
*NL*
was
made
of
wood
,
between
the
planks
narrow
gaps
could
be
seen
.
Across
*NL*
from
where
K.
was
,
the
bed
stood
against
the
wall
under
a
covering
of
*NL*
many
different
colours
.
In
the
middle
of
the
room
a
picture
stood
on
an
*NL*
easel
,
covered
over
with
a
shirt
whose
arms
dangled
down
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
Behind
K.
was
the
window
through
which
the
fog
made
it
impossible
to
see
*NL*
further
than
the
snow
covered
roof
of
the
neighbouring
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
turning
of
the
key
in
the
lock
reminded
K.
that
he
had
not
*NL*
wanted
to
stay
too
long
.
So
he
drew
the
manufacturer
's
letter
out
from
*NL*
his
pocket
,
held
it
out
to
the
painter
and
said
,
``
I
learned
about
you
*NL*
from
this
gentleman
,
an
acquaintance
of
yours
,
and
it
's
on
his
advice
*NL*
that
I
've
come
here
''
.
The
painter
glanced
through
the
letter
and
threw
*NL*
it
down
onto
the
bed
.
If
the
manufacturer
had
not
said
very
clearly
*NL*
that
Titorelli
was
an
acquaintance
of
his
,
a
poor
man
who
was
dependent
*NL*
on
his
charity
,
then
it
would
really
have
been
quite
possible
to
believe
*NL*
that
Titorelli
did
not
know
him
or
at
least
that
he
could
not
remember
*NL*
him
.
This
impression
was
augmented
by
the
painter
's
asking
,
``
Were
you
*NL*
wanting
to
buy
some
pictures
or
did
you
want
to
have
yourself
painted
?
''
*NL*
K.
looked
at
the
painter
in
astonishment
.
What
did
the
letter
actually
*NL*
say
?
K.
had
taken
it
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
manufacturer
had
*NL*
explained
to
the
painter
in
his
letter
that
K.
wanted
nothing
more
with
*NL*
him
than
to
find
out
more
about
his
trial
.
He
had
been
far
too
rash
in
*NL*
coming
here
!
But
now
he
had
to
give
the
painter
some
sort
of
answer
*NL*
and
,
glancing
at
the
easel
,
said
,
``
Are
you
working
on
a
picture
*NL*
currently
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
painter
,
and
he
took
the
shirt
hanging
over
*NL*
the
easel
and
threw
it
onto
the
bed
after
the
letter
.
``
It
's
a
portrait
.
*NL*
Quite
a
good
piece
of
work
,
although
it
's
not
quite
finished
yet
.
''
This
*NL*
was
a
convenient
coincidence
for
K.
,
it
gave
him
a
good
opportunity
to
*NL*
talk
about
the
court
as
the
picture
showed
,
very
clearly
,
a
judge
.
*NL*
What
's
more
,
it
was
remarkably
similar
to
the
picture
in
the
lawyer
's
*NL*
office
,
although
this
one
showed
a
quite
different
judge
,
a
heavy
man
*NL*
with
a
full
beard
which
was
black
and
bushy
and
extended
to
the
sides
*NL*
far
up
the
man
's
cheeks
.
The
lawyer
's
picture
was
also
an
oil
painting
,
*NL*
whereas
this
one
had
been
made
with
pastel
colours
and
was
pale
and
*NL*
unclear
.
But
everything
else
about
the
picture
was
similar
,
as
this
*NL*
judge
,
too
,
was
holding
tightly
to
the
arm
of
his
throne
and
seemed
*NL*
ominously
about
to
rise
from
it
.
At
first
K.
was
about
to
say
,
``
He
*NL*
certainly
is
a
judge
,
''
but
he
held
himself
back
for
the
time
being
and
*NL*
went
closer
to
the
picture
as
if
he
wanted
to
study
it
in
detail
.
There
*NL*
was
a
large
figure
shown
in
middle
of
the
throne
's
back
rest
which
K.
*NL*
could
not
understand
and
asked
the
painter
about
it
.
That
'll
need
some
*NL*
more
work
done
on
it
,
the
painter
told
him
,
and
taking
a
pastel
crayon
*NL*
from
a
small
table
he
added
a
few
strokes
to
the
edges
of
the
figure
but
*NL*
without
making
it
any
clearer
as
far
as
K.
could
make
out
.
``
That
's
the
*NL*
figure
of
justice
,
''
said
the
painter
,
finally
.
``
Now
I
see
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
``
here
's
the
blindfold
and
here
are
the
scales
.
But
are
n't
those
wings
*NL*
on
her
heels
,
and
is
n't
she
moving
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
painter
,
``
I
had
to
*NL*
paint
it
like
that
according
to
the
contract
.
It
's
actually
the
figure
*NL*
of
justice
and
the
goddess
of
victory
all
in
one
.
''
``
That
is
not
a
good
*NL*
combination
,
''
said
K.
with
a
smile
.
``
Justice
needs
to
remain
still
,
*NL*
otherwise
the
scales
will
move
about
and
it
wo
n't
be
possible
to
make
a
*NL*
just
verdict
.
''
``
I
'm
just
doing
what
the
client
wanted
,
''
said
the
*NL*
painter
.
``
Yes
,
certainly
,
''
said
K.
,
who
had
not
meant
to
criticise
*NL*
anyone
by
that
comment
.
``
You
've
painted
the
figure
as
it
actually
*NL*
appears
on
the
throne
.
''
``
No
,
''
said
the
painter
,
``
I
've
never
seen
that
*NL*
figure
or
that
throne
,
it
's
all
just
invention
,
but
they
told
me
what
it
*NL*
was
I
had
to
paint
.
''
``
How
's
that
?
''
asked
K.
pretending
not
fully
to
*NL*
understand
what
the
painter
said
.
``
That
is
a
judge
sitting
on
the
*NL*
judge
's
chair
,
is
n't
it
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
painter
,
``
but
that
judge
*NL*
is
n't
very
high
up
and
he
's
never
sat
on
any
throne
like
that
.
''
``
And
he
*NL*
has
himself
painted
in
such
a
grand
pose
?
He
's
sitting
there
just
like
*NL*
the
president
of
the
court
.
''
``
Yeah
,
gentlemen
like
this
are
very
vain
,
''
*NL*
said
the
painter
.
``
But
they
have
permission
from
higher
up
to
get
*NL*
themselves
painted
like
this
.
It
's
laid
down
quite
strictly
just
what
*NL*
sort
of
portrait
each
of
them
can
get
for
himself
.
Only
it
's
a
pity
*NL*
that
you
ca
n't
make
out
the
details
of
his
costume
and
pose
in
this
*NL*
picture
,
pastel
colours
are
n't
really
suitable
for
showing
people
like
*NL*
this
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
K.
,
``
it
does
seem
odd
that
it
's
in
pastel
colours
.
''
*NL*
``
That
's
what
the
judge
wanted
,
''
said
the
painter
,
``
it
's
meant
to
be
for
*NL*
a
woman
.
''
The
sight
of
the
picture
seemed
to
make
him
feel
like
*NL*
working
,
he
rolled
up
his
shirtsleeves
,
picked
up
a
few
of
the
crayons
,
*NL*
and
K.
watched
as
a
reddish
shadow
built
up
around
the
head
of
the
judge
*NL*
under
their
quivering
tips
and
radiated
out
the
to
edges
of
the
picture
.
*NL*
This
shadow
play
slowly
surrounded
the
head
like
a
decoration
or
lofty
*NL*
distinction
.
But
around
the
figure
of
Justice
,
apart
from
some
*NL*
coloration
that
was
barely
noticeable
,
it
remained
light
,
and
in
this
*NL*
brightness
the
figure
seemed
to
shine
forward
so
that
it
now
looked
like
*NL*
neither
the
God
of
Justice
nor
the
God
of
Victory
,
it
seemed
now
,
*NL*
rather
,
to
be
a
perfect
depiction
of
the
God
of
the
Hunt
.
K.
found
the
*NL*
painter
's
work
more
engrossing
than
he
had
wanted
;
but
finally
he
*NL*
reproached
himself
for
staying
so
long
without
having
done
anything
*NL*
relevant
to
his
own
affair
.
``
What
's
the
name
of
this
judge
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
suddenly
.
``
I
'm
not
allowed
to
tell
you
that
,
''
the
painter
answered
.
He
*NL*
was
bent
deeply
over
the
picture
and
clearly
neglecting
his
guest
who
,
*NL*
at
first
,
he
had
received
with
such
care
.
K.
took
this
to
be
just
a
*NL*
foible
of
the
painter
's
,
and
it
irritated
him
as
it
made
him
lose
time
.
*NL*
``
I
take
it
you
must
be
a
trustee
of
the
court
,
''
he
said
.
The
painter
*NL*
immediately
put
his
crayons
down
,
stood
upright
,
rubbed
his
hands
*NL*
together
and
looked
at
K.
with
a
smile
.
``
Always
straight
out
with
the
*NL*
truth
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
want
to
learn
something
about
the
court
,
like
it
*NL*
says
in
your
letter
of
recommendation
,
but
then
you
start
talking
about
*NL*
my
pictures
to
get
me
on
your
side
.
Still
,
I
wo
n't
hold
it
against
you
,
*NL*
you
were
n't
to
know
that
that
was
entirely
the
wrong
thing
to
try
with
*NL*
me
.
Oh
,
please
!
''
he
said
sharply
,
repelling
K.
's
attempt
to
make
some
*NL*
objection
.
He
then
continued
,
``
And
besides
,
you
're
quite
right
in
your
*NL*
comment
that
I
'm
a
trustee
of
the
court
.
''
He
made
a
pause
,
as
if
*NL*
wanting
to
give
K.
the
time
to
come
to
terms
with
this
fact
.
The
girls
*NL*
could
once
more
be
heard
from
behind
the
door
.
They
were
probably
*NL*
pressed
around
the
keyhole
,
perhaps
they
could
even
see
into
the
room
*NL*
through
the
gaps
in
the
planks
.
K.
forewent
the
opportunity
to
excuse
*NL*
himself
in
some
way
as
he
did
not
wish
to
distract
the
painter
from
what
*NL*
he
was
saying
,
or
else
perhaps
he
did
n't
want
him
to
get
too
far
above
*NL*
himself
and
in
this
way
make
himself
to
some
extent
unattainable
,
so
he
*NL*
asked
,
``
Is
that
a
publicly
acknowledged
position
?
''
``
No
,
''
was
the
*NL*
painter
's
curt
reply
,
as
if
the
question
prevented
him
saying
any
more
.
*NL*
But
K.
wanted
him
to
continue
speaking
and
said
,
``
Well
,
positions
like
*NL*
that
,
that
are
n't
officially
acknowledged
,
can
often
have
more
influence
*NL*
than
those
that
are
.
''
``
And
that
's
how
it
is
with
me
,
''
said
the
painter
,
*NL*
and
nodded
with
a
frown
.
``
I
was
talking
about
your
case
with
the
*NL*
manufacturer
yesterday
,
and
he
asked
me
if
I
would
n't
like
to
help
you
,
*NL*
and
I
answered
:
`
He
can
come
and
see
me
if
he
likes
'
,
and
now
I
'm
*NL*
pleased
to
see
you
here
so
soon
.
This
business
seems
to
be
quite
*NL*
important
to
you
,
and
,
of
course
,
I
'm
not
surprised
at
that
.
Would
you
*NL*
not
like
to
take
your
coat
off
now
?
''
K.
had
intended
to
stay
for
only
a
*NL*
very
short
time
,
but
the
painter
's
invitation
was
nonetheless
very
*NL*
welcome
.
The
air
in
the
room
had
slowly
become
quite
oppressive
for
*NL*
him
,
he
had
several
times
looked
in
amazement
at
a
small
,
iron
stove
in
*NL*
the
corner
that
certainly
could
not
have
been
lit
,
the
heat
of
the
room
*NL*
was
inexplicable
.
As
he
took
off
his
winter
overcoat
and
also
*NL*
unbuttoned
his
frock
coat
the
painter
said
to
him
in
apology
,
``
I
must
*NL*
have
warmth
.
And
it
is
very
cosy
here
,
is
n't
it
.
This
room
's
very
good
*NL*
in
that
respect
.
''
K.
made
no
reply
,
but
it
was
actually
not
the
heat
*NL*
that
made
him
uncomfortable
but
,
much
more
,
the
stuffiness
,
the
air
that
*NL*
almost
made
it
more
difficult
to
breathe
,
the
room
had
probably
not
been
*NL*
ventilated
for
a
long
time
.
The
unpleasantness
of
this
was
made
all
the
*NL*
stronger
for
K.
when
the
painter
invited
him
to
sit
on
the
bed
while
he
*NL*
himself
sat
down
on
the
only
chair
in
the
room
in
front
of
the
easel
.
*NL*
The
painter
even
seemed
to
misunderstand
why
K.
remained
at
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
bed
and
urged
K.
to
make
himself
comfortable
,
and
as
he
hesitated
he
*NL*
went
over
to
the
bed
himself
and
pressed
K.
deep
down
into
the
*NL*
bedclothes
and
pillows
.
Then
he
went
back
to
his
seat
and
at
last
he
*NL*
asked
his
first
objective
question
,
which
made
K.
forget
everything
*NL*
else
.
``
You
're
innocent
,
are
you
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
K
.
He
felt
a
*NL*
simple
joy
at
answering
this
question
,
especially
as
the
answer
was
*NL*
given
to
a
private
individual
and
therefore
would
have
no
consequences
.
*NL*
Up
till
then
no-one
had
asked
him
this
question
so
openly
.
To
make
the
*NL*
most
of
his
pleasure
he
added
,
``
I
am
totally
innocent
.
''
``
So
,
''
said
the
*NL*
painter
,
and
he
lowered
his
head
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
.
Suddenly
he
*NL*
raised
his
head
again
and
said
,
``
Well
if
you
're
innocent
it
's
all
very
*NL*
simple
.
''
K.
began
to
scowl
,
this
supposed
trustee
of
the
court
was
*NL*
talking
like
an
ignorant
child
.
``
My
being
innocent
does
not
make
things
*NL*
simple
,
''
said
K.
Despite
everything
,
he
could
n't
help
smiling
and
*NL*
slowly
shook
his
head
.
``
There
are
many
fine
details
in
which
the
court
*NL*
gets
lost
,
but
in
the
end
it
reaches
into
some
place
where
originally
*NL*
there
was
nothing
and
pulls
enormous
guilt
out
of
it
.
''
``
Yeah
,
yeah
,
*NL*
sure
,
''
said
the
painter
,
as
if
K.
had
been
disturbing
his
train
of
*NL*
thought
for
no
reason
.
``
But
you
are
innocent
,
are
n't
you
?
''
``
Well
of
*NL*
course
I
am
,
''
said
K.
``
That
's
the
main
thing
,
''
said
the
painter
.
There
*NL*
was
no
counter-argument
that
could
influence
him
,
but
although
he
had
*NL*
made
up
his
mind
it
was
not
clear
whether
he
was
talking
this
way
*NL*
because
of
conviction
or
indifference
.
K.
,
then
,
wanted
to
find
out
and
*NL*
said
therefore
,
``
I
'm
sure
you
're
more
familiar
with
the
court
than
I
am
,
*NL*
I
know
hardly
more
about
it
than
what
I
've
heard
,
and
that
's
been
from
*NL*
many
very
different
people
.
But
they
were
all
agreed
on
one
thing
,
and
*NL*
that
was
that
when
ill
thought-out
accusations
are
made
they
are
not
*NL*
ignored
,
and
that
once
the
court
has
made
an
accusation
it
is
convinced
*NL*
of
the
guilt
of
the
defendant
and
it
's
very
hard
to
make
it
think
*NL*
otherwise
.
''
``
Very
hard
?
''
the
painter
asked
,
throwing
one
hand
up
in
the
*NL*
air
.
``
It
's
impossible
to
make
it
think
otherwise
.
If
I
painted
all
the
*NL*
judges
next
to
each
other
here
on
canvas
,
and
you
were
trying
to
defend
*NL*
yourself
in
front
of
it
,
you
'd
have
more
success
with
them
than
you
'd
*NL*
ever
have
with
the
real
court
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
K.
to
himself
,
forgetting
*NL*
that
he
had
only
gone
there
to
investigate
the
painter
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
girls
behind
the
door
started
up
again
,
and
asked
,
*NL*
``
Titorelli
,
is
he
going
to
go
soon
?
''
``
Quiet
!
''
shouted
the
painter
at
*NL*
the
door
,
``
Ca
n't
you
see
I
'm
talking
with
the
gentleman
?
''
But
this
was
*NL*
not
enough
to
satisfy
the
girl
and
she
asked
,
``
You
going
to
paint
his
*NL*
picture
?
''
And
when
the
painter
did
n't
answer
she
added
,
``
Please
do
n't
*NL*
paint
him
,
he
's
an
`
orrible
bloke
.
''
There
followed
an
incomprehensible
,
*NL*
interwoven
babble
of
shouts
and
replies
and
calls
of
agreement
.
The
*NL*
painter
leapt
over
to
the
door
,
opened
it
very
slightly
-
the
girls
'
*NL*
clasped
hands
could
be
seen
stretching
through
the
crack
as
if
they
*NL*
wanted
something
-
and
said
,
``
If
you
're
not
quiet
I
'll
throw
you
all
*NL*
down
the
stairs
.
Sit
down
here
on
the
steps
and
be
quiet
.
''
They
*NL*
probably
did
not
obey
him
immediately
,
so
that
he
had
to
command
,
``
Down
*NL*
on
the
steps
!
''
Only
then
it
became
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
about
that
,
''
said
the
painter
as
he
returned
to
K.
K.
*NL*
had
hardly
turned
towards
the
door
,
he
had
left
it
completely
up
to
the
*NL*
painter
whether
and
how
he
would
place
him
under
his
protection
if
he
*NL*
wanted
to
.
Even
now
,
he
made
hardly
any
movement
as
the
painter
bent
*NL*
over
him
and
,
whispering
into
his
ear
in
order
not
to
be
heard
outside
,
*NL*
said
,
``
These
girls
belong
to
the
court
as
well
.
''
``
How
's
that
?
''
asked
*NL*
K.
,
as
he
leant
his
head
to
one
side
and
looked
at
the
painter
.
But
the
*NL*
painter
sat
back
down
on
his
chair
and
,
half
in
jest
,
half
in
*NL*
explanation
,
``
Well
,
everything
belongs
to
the
court
.
''
``
That
is
*NL*
something
I
had
never
noticed
until
now
,
''
said
K.
curtly
,
this
general
*NL*
comment
of
the
painter
's
made
his
comment
about
the
girls
far
less
*NL*
disturbing
.
Nonetheless
,
K.
looked
for
a
while
at
the
door
,
behind
*NL*
which
the
girls
were
now
sitting
quietly
on
the
steps
.
Except
,
that
one
*NL*
of
them
had
pushed
a
drinking
straw
through
a
crack
between
the
planks
*NL*
and
was
moving
it
slowly
up
and
down
.
``
You
still
do
n't
seem
to
have
*NL*
much
general
idea
of
what
the
court
's
about
''
,
said
the
painter
,
who
had
*NL*
stretched
his
legs
wide
apart
and
was
tapping
loudly
on
the
floor
with
*NL*
the
tip
of
his
foot
.
``
But
as
you
're
innocent
you
wo
n't
need
it
anyway
.
*NL*
I
'll
get
you
out
of
this
by
myself
.
''
``
How
do
you
intend
to
do
that
?
''
*NL*
asked
K.
``
You
did
say
yourself
not
long
ago
that
it
's
quite
impossible
*NL*
to
go
to
the
court
with
reasons
and
proofs
.
''
``
Only
impossible
for
*NL*
reasons
and
proofs
you
take
to
the
court
yourself
''
said
the
painter
,
*NL*
raising
his
forefinger
as
if
K.
had
failed
to
notice
a
fine
distinction
.
*NL*
``
It
goes
differently
if
you
try
to
do
something
behind
the
public
court
,
*NL*
that
's
to
say
in
the
consultation
rooms
,
in
the
corridors
or
here
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
in
my
studio
.
''
K.
now
began
to
find
it
far
easier
to
believe
*NL*
what
the
painter
was
saying
,
or
rather
it
was
largely
in
agreement
with
*NL*
what
he
had
also
been
told
by
others
.
In
fact
it
was
even
quite
*NL*
promising
.
If
it
really
was
so
easy
to
influence
the
judges
through
*NL*
personal
contacts
as
the
lawyer
had
said
then
the
painter
's
contacts
*NL*
with
these
vain
judges
was
especially
important
,
and
at
the
very
least
*NL*
should
not
be
undervalued
.
And
the
painter
would
fit
in
very
well
in
*NL*
the
circle
of
assistants
that
K.
was
slowly
gathering
around
himself
.
*NL*
He
had
been
noted
at
the
bank
for
his
talent
in
organising
,
here
,
where
*NL*
he
was
placed
entirely
on
his
own
resources
,
would
be
a
good
opportunity
*NL*
to
test
that
talent
to
its
limits
.
The
painter
observed
the
effect
his
*NL*
explanation
had
had
on
K.
and
then
,
with
a
certain
unease
,
said
,
``
Does
*NL*
it
not
occur
to
you
that
the
way
I
'm
speaking
is
almost
like
a
lawyer
?
*NL*
It
's
the
incessant
contact
with
the
gentlemen
of
the
court
has
that
*NL*
influence
on
me
.
I
gain
a
lot
by
it
,
of
course
,
but
I
lose
a
lot
,
*NL*
artistically
speaking
.
''
``
How
did
you
first
come
into
contact
with
the
*NL*
judges
,
then
?
''
asked
K.
,
he
wanted
first
to
gain
the
painter
's
trust
*NL*
before
he
took
him
into
his
service
.
``
That
was
very
easy
,
''
said
the
*NL*
painter
,
``
I
inherited
these
contacts
.
My
father
was
court
painter
*NL*
before
me
.
It
's
a
position
that
's
always
inherited
.
They
ca
n't
use
new
*NL*
people
for
it
,
the
rules
governing
how
the
various
grades
of
officials
*NL*
are
painted
are
so
many
and
varied
,
and
,
above
all
,
so
secret
that
no
-
*NL*
one
outside
of
certain
families
even
knows
them
.
In
the
drawer
there
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
I
've
got
my
father
's
notes
,
which
I
do
n't
show
to
anyone
.
*NL*
But
you
're
only
able
to
paint
judges
if
you
know
what
they
say
.
*NL*
Although
,
even
if
I
lost
them
no-one
could
ever
dispute
my
position
*NL*
because
of
all
the
rules
I
just
carry
round
in
my
head
.
All
the
judges
*NL*
want
to
be
painted
like
the
old
,
great
judges
were
,
and
I
'm
the
only
one
*NL*
who
can
do
that
.
''
``
You
are
to
be
envied
,
''
said
K.
,
thinking
of
his
*NL*
position
at
the
bank
.
``
Your
position
is
quite
unassailable
,
then
?
''
*NL*
``
Yes
,
quite
unassailable
,
''
said
the
painter
,
and
he
raised
his
shoulders
*NL*
in
pride
.
``
That
's
how
I
can
even
afford
to
help
some
poor
man
facing
*NL*
trial
now
and
then
.
''
``
And
how
do
you
do
that
?
''
asked
K.
,
as
if
the
*NL*
painter
had
not
just
described
him
as
a
poor
man
.
The
painter
did
not
*NL*
let
himself
be
distracted
,
but
said
,
``
In
your
case
,
for
instance
,
as
*NL*
you
're
totally
innocent
,
this
is
what
I
'll
do
.
''
The
repeated
mention
of
*NL*
K.
's
innocence
was
becoming
irksome
to
him
.
It
sometimes
seemed
to
him
*NL*
as
if
the
painter
was
using
these
comments
to
make
a
favourable
outcome
*NL*
to
the
trial
a
precondition
for
his
help
,
which
of
course
would
make
the
*NL*
help
itself
unnecessary
.
But
despite
these
doubts
K.
forced
himself
not
*NL*
to
interrupt
the
painter
.
He
did
not
want
to
do
without
the
painter
's
*NL*
help
,
that
was
what
he
had
decided
,
and
this
help
did
not
seem
in
any
*NL*
way
less
questionable
than
that
of
the
lawyer
.
K.
valued
the
painter
's
*NL*
help
far
more
highly
because
it
was
offered
in
a
way
that
was
more
*NL*
harmless
and
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
painter
had
pulled
his
seat
closer
to
the
bed
and
continued
in
*NL*
a
subdued
voice
:
``
I
forgot
to
ask
you
;
what
sort
of
acquittal
is
it
you
*NL*
want
?
There
are
three
possibilities
;
absolute
acquittal
,
apparent
*NL*
acquittal
and
deferment
.
Absolute
acquittal
is
the
best
,
of
course
,
*NL*
only
there
's
nothing
I
could
do
to
get
that
sort
of
outcome
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
there
's
anyone
at
all
who
could
do
anything
to
get
an
absolute
*NL*
acquittal
.
Probably
the
only
thing
that
could
do
that
is
if
the
accused
*NL*
is
innocent
.
As
you
are
innocent
it
could
actually
be
possible
and
you
*NL*
could
depend
on
your
innocence
alone
.
In
that
case
you
wo
n't
need
me
or
*NL*
any
other
kind
of
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
K.
was
astonished
at
this
orderly
explanation
,
but
then
,
*NL*
just
as
quietly
as
the
painter
,
he
said
,
``
I
think
you
're
contradicting
*NL*
yourself
.
''
``
How
's
that
?
''
asked
the
painter
patiently
,
leaning
back
with
*NL*
a
smile
.
This
smile
made
K.
feel
as
if
he
were
examining
not
the
words
*NL*
of
the
painter
but
seeking
out
inconsistencies
in
the
procedures
of
the
*NL*
court
itself
.
Nonetheless
,
he
continued
unabashed
and
said
,
``
You
*NL*
remarked
earlier
that
the
court
can
not
be
approached
with
reasoned
*NL*
proofs
,
you
later
restricted
this
to
the
open
court
,
and
now
you
go
so
*NL*
far
as
to
say
that
an
innocent
man
needs
no
assistance
in
court
.
That
*NL*
entails
a
contradiction
.
Moreover
,
you
said
earlier
that
the
judges
can
*NL*
be
influenced
personally
but
now
you
insist
that
an
absolute
acquittal
,
*NL*
as
you
call
it
,
can
never
be
attained
through
personal
influence
.
That
*NL*
entails
a
second
contradiction
.
''
``
It
's
quite
easy
to
clear
up
these
*NL*
contradictions
,
''
said
the
painter
.
``
We
're
talking
about
two
different
*NL*
things
here
,
there
's
what
it
says
in
the
law
and
there
's
what
I
know
*NL*
from
my
own
experience
,
you
should
n't
get
the
two
confused
.
I
've
never
*NL*
seen
it
in
writing
,
but
the
law
does
,
of
course
,
say
on
the
one
hand
*NL*
that
the
innocent
will
be
set
free
,
but
on
the
other
hand
it
does
n't
say
*NL*
that
the
judges
can
be
influenced
.
But
in
my
experience
it
's
the
other
*NL*
way
round
.
I
do
n't
know
of
any
absolute
acquittals
but
I
do
know
of
*NL*
many
times
when
a
judge
has
been
influenced
.
It
's
possible
,
of
course
,
*NL*
that
there
was
no
innocence
in
any
of
the
cases
I
know
about
.
But
is
*NL*
that
likely
?
Not
a
single
innocent
defendant
in
so
many
cases
?
When
I
*NL*
was
a
boy
I
used
to
listen
closely
to
my
father
when
he
told
us
about
*NL*
court
cases
at
home
,
and
the
judges
that
came
to
his
studio
talked
about
*NL*
the
court
,
in
our
circles
nobody
talks
about
anything
else
;
I
hardly
*NL*
ever
got
the
chance
to
go
to
court
myself
but
always
made
use
of
it
when
*NL*
I
could
,
I
've
listened
to
countless
trials
at
important
stages
in
their
*NL*
development
,
I
've
followed
them
closely
as
far
as
they
could
be
*NL*
followed
,
and
I
have
to
say
that
I
've
never
seen
a
single
acquittal
.
''
*NL*
``
So
.
Not
a
single
acquittal
,
''
said
K.
,
as
if
talking
to
himself
and
his
*NL*
hopes
.
``
That
confirms
the
impression
I
already
have
of
the
court
.
So
*NL*
there
's
no
point
in
it
from
this
side
either
.
They
could
replace
the
*NL*
whole
court
with
a
single
hangman
.
''
``
You
should
n't
generalise
,
''
said
*NL*
the
painter
,
dissatisfied
,
``
I
've
only
been
talking
about
my
own
*NL*
experience
.
''
``
Well
that
's
enough
,
''
said
K.
,
``
or
have
you
heard
of
any
*NL*
acquittals
that
happened
earlier
?
''
``
They
say
there
have
been
some
*NL*
acquittals
earlier
,
''
the
painter
answered
,
``
but
it
's
very
hard
to
be
*NL*
sure
about
it
.
The
courts
do
n't
make
their
final
conclusions
public
,
*NL*
not
even
the
judges
are
allowed
to
know
about
them
,
so
that
all
we
know
*NL*
about
these
earlier
cases
are
just
legends
.
But
most
of
them
did
*NL*
involve
absolute
acquittals
,
you
can
believe
that
,
but
they
ca
n't
be
*NL*
proved
.
On
the
other
hand
,
you
should
n't
forget
all
about
them
either
,
*NL*
I
'm
sure
there
is
some
truth
to
them
,
and
they
are
very
beautiful
,
I
've
*NL*
painted
a
few
pictures
myself
depicting
these
legends
.
''
``
My
assessment
*NL*
will
not
be
altered
by
mere
legends
,
''
said
K.
``
I
do
n't
suppose
it
's
*NL*
possible
to
cite
these
legends
in
court
,
is
it
?
''
The
painter
laughed
.
*NL*
``
No
,
you
ca
n't
cite
them
in
court
,
''
he
said
.
``
Then
there
's
no
point
in
*NL*
talking
about
them
,
''
said
K.
,
he
wanted
,
for
the
time
being
,
to
accept
*NL*
anything
the
painter
told
him
,
even
if
he
thought
it
unlikely
or
*NL*
contradicted
what
he
had
been
told
by
others
.
He
did
not
now
have
the
*NL*
time
to
examine
the
truth
of
everything
the
painter
said
or
even
to
*NL*
disprove
it
,
he
would
have
achieved
as
much
as
he
could
if
the
painter
*NL*
would
help
him
in
any
way
even
if
his
help
would
not
be
decisive
.
As
a
*NL*
result
,
he
said
,
``
So
let
's
pay
no
more
attention
to
absolute
acquittal
,
*NL*
but
you
mentioned
two
other
possibilities
.
''
``
Apparent
acquittal
and
*NL*
deferment
.
They
're
the
only
possibilities
,
''
said
the
painter
.
``
But
*NL*
before
we
talk
about
them
,
would
you
not
like
to
take
your
coat
off
?
*NL*
You
must
be
hot
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
K.
,
who
until
then
had
paid
attention
to
*NL*
nothing
but
the
painter
's
explanations
,
but
now
that
he
had
had
the
heat
*NL*
pointed
out
to
him
his
brow
began
to
sweat
heavily
.
``
It
's
almost
*NL*
unbearable
.
''
The
painter
nodded
as
if
he
understood
K.
's
discomfort
*NL*
very
well
.
``
Could
we
not
open
the
window
?
''
asked
K.
``
No
,
''
said
the
*NL*
painter
.
``
It
's
only
a
fixed
pane
of
glass
,
it
ca
n't
be
opened
.
''
K.
now
*NL*
realised
that
all
this
time
he
had
been
hoping
the
painter
would
*NL*
suddenly
go
over
to
the
window
and
pull
it
open
.
He
had
prepared
*NL*
himself
even
for
the
fog
that
he
would
breathe
in
through
his
open
*NL*
mouth
.
The
thought
that
here
he
was
entirely
cut
off
from
the
air
made
*NL*
him
feel
dizzy
.
He
tapped
lightly
on
the
bedspread
beside
him
and
,
with
*NL*
a
weak
voice
,
said
,
``
That
is
very
inconvenient
and
unhealthy
.
''
``
Oh
no
,
''
*NL*
said
the
painter
in
defence
of
his
window
,
``
as
it
ca
n't
be
opened
this
*NL*
room
retains
the
heat
better
than
if
the
window
were
double
glazed
,
even
*NL*
though
it
's
only
a
single
pane
.
There
's
not
much
need
to
air
the
room
*NL*
as
there
's
so
much
ventilation
through
the
gaps
in
the
wood
,
but
when
I
*NL*
do
want
to
I
can
open
one
of
my
doors
,
or
even
both
of
them
.
''
K.
was
*NL*
slightly
consoled
by
this
explanation
and
looked
around
to
see
where
the
*NL*
second
door
was
.
The
painter
saw
him
do
so
and
said
,
``
It
's
behind
you
,
*NL*
I
had
to
hide
it
behind
the
bed
.
''
Only
then
was
K.
able
to
see
the
*NL*
little
door
in
the
wall
.
``
It
's
really
much
too
small
for
a
studio
*NL*
here
,
''
said
the
painter
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
anticipate
an
objection
K.
*NL*
would
make
.
``
I
had
to
arrange
things
as
well
as
I
could
.
That
's
*NL*
obviously
a
very
bad
place
for
the
bed
,
in
front
of
the
door
.
For
*NL*
instance
when
the
judge
I
'm
painting
at
present
comes
he
always
comes
*NL*
through
the
door
by
the
bed
,
and
I
've
even
given
him
a
key
to
this
door
*NL*
so
that
he
can
wait
for
me
here
in
the
studio
when
I
'm
not
home
.
*NL*
Although
nowadays
he
usually
comes
early
in
the
morning
when
I
'm
still
*NL*
asleep
.
And
of
course
,
it
always
wakes
me
up
when
I
hear
the
door
*NL*
opened
beside
the
bed
,
however
fast
asleep
I
am
.
If
you
could
hear
the
*NL*
way
I
curse
him
as
he
climbs
over
my
bed
in
the
morning
you
'd
lose
all
*NL*
respect
for
judges
.
I
suppose
I
could
take
the
key
away
from
him
but
*NL*
that
'd
only
make
things
worse
.
It
only
takes
a
tiny
effort
to
break
any
*NL*
of
the
doors
here
off
their
hinges
.
''
All
the
time
the
painter
was
*NL*
speaking
,
K.
was
considering
whether
he
should
take
off
his
coat
,
but
he
*NL*
finally
realised
that
,
if
he
did
n't
do
so
,
he
would
be
quite
unable
to
*NL*
stay
here
any
longer
,
so
he
took
off
his
frock
coat
and
lay
it
on
his
*NL*
knee
so
that
he
could
put
it
back
on
again
as
soon
as
the
conversation
*NL*
was
over
.
He
had
hardly
done
this
when
one
of
the
girls
called
out
,
*NL*
``
Now
he
's
taken
his
coat
off
!
''
and
they
could
all
be
heard
pressing
*NL*
around
the
gaps
in
the
planks
to
see
the
spectacle
for
themselves
.
``
The
*NL*
girls
think
I
'm
going
to
paint
your
portrait
,
''
said
the
painter
,
``
and
*NL*
that
's
why
you
're
taking
your
coat
off
.
''
``
I
see
,
''
said
K.
,
only
*NL*
slightly
amused
by
this
,
as
he
felt
little
better
than
he
had
before
*NL*
even
though
he
now
sat
in
his
shirtsleeves
.
With
some
irritation
he
*NL*
asked
,
``
What
did
you
say
the
two
other
possibilities
were
?
''
He
had
*NL*
already
forgotten
the
terms
used
.
``
Apparent
acquittal
and
deferment
,
''
*NL*
said
the
painter
.
``
It
's
up
to
you
which
one
you
choose
.
You
can
get
*NL*
either
of
them
if
I
help
you
,
but
it
'll
take
some
effort
of
course
,
the
*NL*
difference
between
them
is
that
apparent
acquittal
needs
concentrated
*NL*
effort
for
a
while
and
that
deferment
takes
much
less
effort
but
it
has
*NL*
to
be
sustained
.
Now
then
,
apparent
acquittal
.
If
that
's
what
you
want
*NL*
I
'll
write
down
an
assertion
of
your
innocence
on
a
piece
of
paper
.
The
*NL*
text
for
an
assertion
of
this
sort
was
passed
down
to
me
from
my
father
*NL*
and
it
's
quite
unassailable
.
I
take
this
assertion
round
to
the
judges
*NL*
I
know
.
So
I
'll
start
off
with
the
one
I
'm
currently
painting
,
and
put
*NL*
the
assertion
to
him
when
he
comes
for
his
sitting
this
evening
.
I
'll
*NL*
lay
the
assertion
in
front
of
him
,
explain
that
you
're
innocent
and
give
*NL*
him
my
personal
guarantee
of
it
.
And
that
's
not
just
a
superficial
*NL*
guarantee
,
it
's
a
real
one
and
it
's
binding
.
''
The
painter
's
eyes
seemed
*NL*
to
show
some
reproach
of
K.
for
wanting
to
impose
that
sort
of
*NL*
responsibility
on
him
.
``
That
would
be
very
kind
of
you
''
,
said
K.
``
And
*NL*
would
the
judge
then
believe
you
and
nonetheless
not
pass
an
absolute
*NL*
acquittal
?
''
``
It
's
like
I
just
said
,
''
answered
the
painter
.
``
And
*NL*
anyway
,
it
's
not
entirely
sure
that
all
the
judges
would
believe
me
,
*NL*
many
of
them
,
for
instance
,
might
want
me
to
bring
you
to
see
them
*NL*
personally
.
So
then
you
'd
have
to
come
along
too
.
But
at
least
then
,
*NL*
if
that
happens
,
the
matter
is
half
way
won
,
especially
as
I
'd
teach
you
*NL*
in
advance
exactly
how
you
'd
need
to
act
with
the
judge
concerned
,
of
*NL*
course
.
What
also
happens
,
though
,
is
that
there
are
some
judges
who
'll
*NL*
turn
me
down
in
advance
,
and
that
's
worse
.
I
'll
certainly
make
several
*NL*
attempts
,
but
still
,
we
'll
have
to
forget
about
them
,
but
at
least
we
*NL*
can
afford
to
do
that
as
no
one
judge
can
pass
the
decisive
verdict
.
*NL*
Then
when
I
've
got
enough
judges
'
signatures
on
this
document
I
take
it
*NL*
to
the
judge
who
's
concerned
with
your
case
.
I
might
even
have
his
*NL*
signature
already
,
in
which
case
things
develop
a
bit
quicker
than
they
*NL*
would
do
otherwise
.
But
there
are
n't
usually
many
hold
ups
from
then
*NL*
on
,
and
that
's
the
time
that
the
defendant
can
feel
most
confident
.
*NL*
It
's
odd
,
but
true
,
that
people
feel
more
confidence
in
this
time
than
*NL*
they
do
after
they
've
been
acquitted
.
There
's
no
particular
exertion
*NL*
needed
now
.
When
he
has
the
document
asserting
the
defendant
's
*NL*
innocence
,
guaranteed
by
a
number
of
other
judges
,
the
judge
can
acquit
*NL*
you
without
any
worries
,
and
although
there
are
still
several
*NL*
formalities
to
be
gone
through
there
's
no
doubt
that
that
's
what
he
'll
*NL*
do
as
a
favour
to
me
and
several
other
acquaintances
.
You
,
however
,
*NL*
walk
out
the
court
and
you
're
free
.
''
``
So
,
then
I
'll
be
free
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
hesitantly
.
``
That
's
right
,
''
said
the
painter
,
``
but
only
apparently
free
*NL*
or
,
to
put
it
a
better
way
,
temporarily
free
,
as
the
most
junior
judges
,
*NL*
the
ones
I
know
,
they
do
n't
have
the
right
to
give
the
final
acquittal
.
*NL*
Only
the
highest
judge
can
do
that
,
in
the
court
that
's
quite
out
of
reach
*NL*
for
you
,
for
me
and
for
all
of
us
.
We
do
n't
know
how
things
look
there
*NL*
and
,
incidentally
,
we
do
n't
want
to
know
.
The
right
to
acquit
people
*NL*
is
a
major
privilege
and
our
judges
do
n't
have
it
,
but
they
do
have
the
*NL*
right
to
free
people
from
the
indictment
.
That
's
to
say
,
if
they
're
*NL*
freed
in
this
way
then
for
the
time
being
the
charge
is
withdrawn
but
*NL*
it
's
still
hanging
over
their
heads
and
it
only
takes
an
order
from
*NL*
higher
up
to
bring
it
back
into
force
.
And
as
I
'm
in
such
good
contact
*NL*
with
the
court
I
can
also
tell
you
how
the
difference
between
absolute
*NL*
and
apparent
acquittal
is
described
,
just
in
a
superficial
way
,
in
the
*NL*
directives
to
the
court
offices
.
If
there
's
an
absolute
acquittal
all
*NL*
proceedings
should
stop
,
everything
disappears
from
the
process
,
not
*NL*
just
the
indictment
but
the
trial
and
even
the
acquittal
disappears
,
*NL*
everything
just
disappears
.
With
an
apparent
acquittal
it
's
different
.
*NL*
When
that
happens
,
nothing
has
changed
except
that
the
case
for
your
*NL*
innocence
,
for
your
acquittal
and
the
grounds
for
the
acquittal
have
*NL*
been
made
stronger
.
Apart
from
that
,
proceedings
go
on
as
before
,
the
*NL*
court
offices
continue
their
business
and
the
case
gets
passed
to
higher
*NL*
courts
,
gets
passed
back
down
to
the
lower
courts
and
so
on
,
backwards
*NL*
and
forwards
,
sometimes
faster
,
sometimes
slower
,
to
and
fro
.
It
's
*NL*
impossible
to
know
exactly
what
's
happening
while
this
is
going
on
.
*NL*
Seen
from
outside
it
can
sometimes
seem
that
everything
has
been
long
*NL*
since
forgotten
,
the
documents
have
been
lost
and
the
acquittal
is
*NL*
complete
.
No-one
familiar
with
the
court
would
believe
it
.
No
*NL*
documents
ever
get
lost
,
the
court
forgets
nothing
.
One
day
-
no-one
*NL*
expects
it
-
some
judge
or
other
picks
up
the
documents
and
looks
more
*NL*
closely
at
them
,
he
notices
that
this
particular
case
is
still
active
,
*NL*
and
orders
the
defendant
's
immediate
arrest
.
I
've
been
talking
here
as
*NL*
if
there
's
a
long
delay
between
apparent
acquittal
and
re-arrest
,
that
*NL*
is
quite
possible
and
I
do
know
of
cases
like
that
,
but
it
's
just
as
*NL*
likely
that
the
defendant
goes
home
after
he
's
been
acquitted
and
finds
*NL*
somebody
there
waiting
to
re-arrest
him
.
Then
,
of
course
,
his
life
as
a
*NL*
free
man
is
at
an
end
.
''
``
And
does
the
trial
start
over
again
?
''
asked
*NL*
K.
,
finding
it
hard
to
believe
.
``
The
trial
will
always
start
over
*NL*
again
,
''
said
the
painter
,
``
but
there
is
,
once
again
as
before
,
the
*NL*
possibility
of
getting
an
apparent
acquittal
.
Once
again
,
the
accused
*NL*
has
to
muster
all
his
strength
and
must
n't
give
up
.
''
The
painter
said
*NL*
that
last
phrase
possibly
as
a
result
of
the
impression
that
K.
,
whose
*NL*
shoulders
had
dropped
somewhat
,
gave
on
him
.
``
But
to
get
a
second
*NL*
acquittal
,
''
asked
K.
,
as
if
in
anticipation
of
further
revelations
by
*NL*
the
painter
,
``
is
that
not
harder
to
get
than
the
first
time
?
''
``
As
far
*NL*
as
that
's
concerned
,
''
answered
the
painter
,
``
there
's
nothing
you
can
say
*NL*
for
certain
.
You
mean
,
do
you
,
that
the
second
arrest
would
have
an
*NL*
adverse
influence
on
the
judge
and
the
verdict
he
passes
on
the
*NL*
defendant
?
That
's
not
how
it
happens
.
When
the
acquittal
is
passed
the
*NL*
judges
are
already
aware
that
re-arrest
is
likely
.
So
when
it
happens
*NL*
it
has
hardly
any
effect
.
But
there
are
countless
other
reasons
why
the
*NL*
judges
'
mood
and
their
legal
acumen
in
the
case
can
be
altered
,
and
*NL*
efforts
to
obtain
the
second
acquittal
must
therefore
be
suited
to
the
*NL*
new
conditions
,
and
generally
just
as
vigorous
as
the
first
.
''
``
But
this
*NL*
second
acquittal
will
once
again
not
be
final
,
''
said
K.
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
.
``
Of
course
not
,
''
said
the
painter
,
``
the
second
acquittal
is
*NL*
followed
by
the
third
arrest
,
the
third
acquittal
by
the
fourth
arrest
*NL*
and
so
on
.
That
's
what
is
meant
by
the
term
apparent
acquittal
.
''
K.
*NL*
was
silent
.
``
You
clearly
do
n't
think
an
apparent
acquittal
offers
much
*NL*
advantage
,
''
said
the
painter
,
``
perhaps
deferment
would
suit
you
better
.
*NL*
Would
you
like
me
to
explain
what
deferment
is
about
?
''
K.
nodded
.
The
*NL*
painter
had
leant
back
and
spread
himself
out
in
his
chair
,
his
*NL*
nightshirt
was
wide
open
,
he
had
pushed
his
hand
inside
and
was
stroking
*NL*
his
breast
and
his
sides
.
``
Deferment
,
''
said
the
painter
,
looking
*NL*
vaguely
in
front
of
himself
for
a
while
as
if
trying
to
find
a
perfectly
*NL*
appropriate
explanation
,
``
deferment
consists
of
keeping
proceedings
*NL*
permanently
in
their
earliest
stages
.
To
do
that
,
the
accused
and
those
*NL*
helping
him
need
to
keep
in
continuous
personal
contact
with
the
court
,
*NL*
especially
those
helping
him
.
I
repeat
,
this
does
n't
require
so
much
*NL*
effort
as
getting
an
apparent
acquittal
,
but
it
probably
requires
a
lot
*NL*
more
attention
.
You
must
never
let
the
trial
out
of
your
sight
,
you
*NL*
have
to
go
and
see
the
appropriate
judge
at
regular
intervals
as
well
as
*NL*
when
something
in
particular
comes
up
and
,
whatever
you
do
,
you
have
to
*NL*
try
and
remain
friendly
with
him
;
if
you
do
n't
know
the
judge
personally
*NL*
you
have
to
influence
him
through
the
judges
you
do
know
,
and
you
have
*NL*
to
do
it
without
giving
up
on
the
direct
discussions
.
As
long
as
you
*NL*
do
n't
fail
to
do
any
of
these
things
you
can
be
reasonably
sure
the
*NL*
trial
wo
n't
get
past
its
first
stages
.
The
trial
does
n't
stop
,
but
the
*NL*
defendant
is
almost
as
certain
of
avoiding
conviction
as
if
he
'd
been
*NL*
acquitted
.
Compared
with
an
apparent
acquittal
,
deferment
has
the
*NL*
advantage
that
the
defendant
's
future
is
less
uncertain
,
he
's
safe
from
*NL*
the
shock
of
being
suddenly
re-arrested
and
does
n't
need
to
fear
the
*NL*
exertions
and
stress
involved
in
getting
an
apparent
acquittal
just
when
*NL*
everything
else
in
his
life
would
make
it
most
difficult
.
Deferment
*NL*
does
have
certain
disadvantages
of
its
own
though
,
too
,
and
they
*NL*
should
n't
be
under-estimated
.
I
do
n't
mean
by
this
that
the
defendant
*NL*
is
never
free
,
he
's
never
free
in
the
proper
sense
of
the
word
with
an
*NL*
apparent
acquittal
either
.
There
's
another
disadvantage
.
Proceedings
*NL*
ca
n't
be
prevented
from
moving
forward
unless
there
are
some
at
least
*NL*
ostensible
reasons
given
.
So
something
needs
to
seem
to
be
happening
*NL*
when
looked
at
from
the
outside
.
This
means
that
from
time
to
time
*NL*
various
injunctions
have
to
be
obeyed
,
the
accused
has
to
be
questioned
,
*NL*
investigations
have
to
take
place
and
so
on
.
The
trial
's
been
*NL*
artificially
constrained
inside
a
tiny
circle
,
and
it
has
to
be
*NL*
continuously
spun
round
within
it
.
And
that
,
of
course
,
brings
with
it
*NL*
certain
unpleasantnesses
for
the
accused
,
although
you
should
n't
imagine
*NL*
they
're
all
that
bad
.
All
of
this
is
just
for
show
,
the
interrogations
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
they
're
only
very
short
,
if
you
ever
do
n't
have
the
time
*NL*
or
do
n't
feel
like
going
to
them
you
can
offer
an
excuse
,
with
some
*NL*
judges
you
can
even
arrange
the
injunctions
together
a
long
time
in
*NL*
advance
,
in
essence
all
it
means
is
that
,
as
the
accused
,
you
have
to
*NL*
report
to
the
judge
from
time
to
time
.
''
Even
while
the
painter
was
*NL*
speaking
those
last
words
K.
had
laid
his
coat
over
his
arm
and
had
*NL*
stood
up
.
Immediately
,
from
outside
the
door
,
there
was
a
cry
of
`
He
's
*NL*
standing
up
now
!
'
.
``
Are
you
leaving
already
?
''
asked
the
painter
,
who
*NL*
had
also
stood
up
.
``
It
must
be
the
air
that
's
driving
you
out
.
I
'm
*NL*
very
sorry
about
that
.
There
's
still
a
lot
I
need
to
tell
you
.
I
had
*NL*
to
put
everything
very
briefly
but
I
hope
at
least
it
was
all
clear
.
''
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
K.
,
whose
head
was
aching
from
the
effort
of
listening
.
*NL*
Despite
this
affirmation
the
painter
summed
it
all
up
once
more
,
as
if
*NL*
he
wanted
to
give
K.
something
to
console
him
on
his
way
home
.
``
Both
*NL*
have
in
common
that
they
prevent
the
defendant
being
convicted
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
But
they
also
prevent
his
being
properly
acquitted
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
quietly
,
as
if
ashamed
to
acknowledge
it
.
``
You
've
got
it
,
in
essence
,
''
*NL*
said
the
painter
quickly
.
K.
placed
his
hand
on
his
winter
overcoat
but
*NL*
could
not
bring
himself
to
put
it
on
.
Most
of
all
he
would
have
liked
*NL*
to
pack
everything
together
and
run
out
to
the
fresh
air
.
Not
even
the
*NL*
girls
could
induce
him
to
put
his
coat
on
,
even
though
they
were
already
*NL*
loudly
telling
each
other
that
he
was
doing
so
.
The
painter
still
had
*NL*
to
interpret
K.
's
mood
in
some
way
,
so
he
said
,
``
I
expect
you
've
*NL*
deliberately
avoided
deciding
between
my
suggestions
yet
.
That
's
good
.
*NL*
I
would
even
have
advised
against
making
a
decision
straight
away
.
*NL*
There
's
no
more
than
a
hair
's
breadth
of
difference
between
the
*NL*
advantages
and
disadvantages
.
Everything
has
to
be
carefully
weighed
*NL*
up
.
But
the
most
important
thing
is
you
should
n't
lose
too
much
time
.
''
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
back
here
again
soon
,
''
said
K.
,
who
had
suddenly
decided
to
*NL*
put
his
frock
coat
on
,
threw
his
overcoat
over
his
shoulder
and
hurried
*NL*
over
to
the
door
behind
which
the
girls
now
began
to
scream
.
K.
thought
*NL*
he
could
even
see
the
screaming
girls
through
the
door
.
``
Well
,
you
'll
*NL*
have
to
keep
your
word
,
''
said
the
painter
,
who
had
not
followed
him
,
*NL*
``
otherwise
I
'll
come
to
the
bank
to
ask
about
it
myself
.
''
``
Will
you
open
*NL*
this
door
for
me
,
''
said
K.
pulling
at
the
handle
which
,
as
he
noticed
*NL*
from
the
resistance
,
was
being
held
tightly
by
the
girls
on
the
other
*NL*
side
.
``
Do
you
want
to
be
bothered
by
the
girls
?
''
asked
the
painter
.
*NL*
``
It
's
better
if
you
use
the
other
way
out
,
''
he
said
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
door
behind
the
bed
.
K.
agreed
to
this
and
jumped
back
to
the
bed
.
But
*NL*
instead
of
opening
that
door
the
painter
crawled
under
the
bed
and
from
*NL*
underneath
it
asked
K.
,
``
Just
a
moment
more
,
would
you
not
like
to
see
a
*NL*
picture
I
could
sell
to
you
?
''
K.
did
not
want
to
be
impolite
,
the
*NL*
painter
really
had
taken
his
side
and
promised
to
help
him
more
in
the
*NL*
future
,
and
because
of
K.
's
forgetfulness
there
had
been
no
mention
of
*NL*
any
payment
for
the
painter
's
help
,
so
K.
could
not
turn
him
down
now
*NL*
and
allowed
him
to
show
him
the
picture
,
even
though
he
was
quivering
*NL*
with
impatience
to
get
out
of
the
studio
.
From
under
the
bed
,
the
*NL*
painter
withdrew
a
pile
of
unframed
paintings
.
They
were
so
covered
in
*NL*
dust
that
when
the
painter
tried
to
blow
it
off
the
one
on
top
the
dust
*NL*
swirled
around
in
front
of
K.
's
eyes
,
robbing
him
of
breath
for
some
*NL*
time
.
``
Moorland
landscape
,
''
said
the
painter
passing
the
picture
to
K
.
*NL*
It
showed
two
sickly
trees
,
well
separated
from
each
other
in
dark
*NL*
grass
.
In
the
background
there
was
a
multi-coloured
sunset
.
``
That
's
*NL*
nice
,
''
said
K.
``
I
'll
buy
it
.
''
K.
expressed
himself
in
this
curt
way
*NL*
without
any
thought
,
so
he
was
glad
when
the
painter
did
not
take
this
*NL*
amiss
and
picked
up
a
second
painting
from
the
floor
.
``
This
is
a
*NL*
counterpart
to
the
first
picture
,
''
said
the
painter
.
Perhaps
it
had
*NL*
been
intended
as
a
counterpart
,
but
there
was
not
the
slightest
*NL*
difference
to
be
seen
between
it
and
the
first
picture
,
there
were
the
*NL*
trees
,
there
the
grass
and
there
the
sunset
.
But
this
was
of
little
*NL*
importance
to
K.
``
They
are
beautiful
landscapes
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
'll
buy
*NL*
them
both
and
hang
them
in
my
office
.
''
``
You
seem
to
like
this
subject
,
''
*NL*
said
the
painter
,
picking
up
a
third
painting
,
``
good
job
I
've
still
got
*NL*
another
,
similar
picture
here
.
''
The
picture
though
,
was
not
similar
,
*NL*
rather
it
was
exactly
the
same
moorland
landscape
.
The
painter
was
*NL*
fully
exploiting
this
opportunity
to
sell
off
his
old
pictures
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
take
this
one
too
,
''
said
K.
``
How
much
do
the
three
paintings
cost
?
''
*NL*
``
We
can
talk
about
that
next
time
,
''
said
the
painter
.
``
You
're
in
a
*NL*
hurry
now
,
and
we
'll
still
be
in
contact
.
And
besides
,
I
'm
glad
you
*NL*
like
the
paintings
,
I
'll
give
you
all
the
paintings
I
've
got
down
here
.
*NL*
They
're
all
moorland
landscapes
,
I
've
painted
a
lot
of
moorland
*NL*
landscapes
.
A
lot
of
people
do
n't
like
that
sort
of
picture
because
*NL*
they
're
too
gloomy
,
but
there
are
others
,
and
you
're
one
of
them
,
who
*NL*
love
gloomy
themes
.
''
But
K.
was
not
in
the
mood
to
hear
about
the
*NL*
professional
experiences
of
this
painter
cum
beggar
.
``
Wrap
them
all
*NL*
up
!
''
he
called
out
,
interrupting
the
painter
as
he
was
speaking
,
``
my
*NL*
servant
will
come
to
fetch
them
in
the
morning
.
''
``
There
's
no
need
for
*NL*
that
,
''
said
the
painter
.
``
I
expect
I
can
find
a
porter
for
you
who
can
*NL*
go
with
you
now
.
''
And
,
at
last
,
he
leant
over
the
bed
and
unlocked
the
*NL*
door
.
``
Just
step
on
the
bed
,
do
n't
worry
about
that
,
''
said
the
painter
,
*NL*
``
that
's
what
everyone
does
who
comes
in
here
.
''
Even
without
this
*NL*
invitation
,
K.
had
shown
no
compunction
in
already
placing
his
foot
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
bed
covers
,
then
he
looked
out
through
the
open
door
*NL*
and
drew
his
foot
back
again
.
``
What
is
that
?
''
he
asked
the
painter
.
*NL*
``
What
are
you
so
surprised
at
?
''
he
asked
,
surprised
in
his
turn
.
``
Those
*NL*
are
court
offices
.
Did
n't
you
know
there
are
court
offices
here
?
There
*NL*
are
court
offices
in
almost
every
attic
,
why
should
this
building
be
any
*NL*
different
?
Even
my
studio
is
actually
one
of
the
court
offices
but
the
*NL*
court
put
it
at
my
disposal
.
''
It
was
not
so
much
finding
court
offices
*NL*
even
here
that
shocked
K.
,
he
was
mainly
shocked
at
himself
,
at
his
own
*NL*
naivety
in
court
matters
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
one
of
the
most
basic
*NL*
rules
governing
how
a
defendant
should
behave
was
always
to
be
prepared
,
*NL*
never
allow
surprises
,
never
to
look
,
unsuspecting
,
to
the
right
when
*NL*
the
judge
stood
beside
him
to
his
left
-
and
this
was
the
very
basic
*NL*
rule
that
he
was
continually
violating
.
A
long
corridor
extended
in
*NL*
from
of
him
,
air
blew
in
from
it
which
,
compared
with
the
air
in
the
*NL*
studio
,
was
refreshing
.
There
were
benches
set
along
each
side
of
the
*NL*
corridor
just
as
in
the
waiting
area
for
the
office
he
went
to
himself
.
*NL*
There
seemed
to
be
precise
rules
governing
how
offices
should
be
*NL*
equipped
.
There
did
not
seem
to
be
many
people
visiting
the
offices
*NL*
that
day
.
There
was
a
man
there
,
half
sitting
,
half
laying
,
his
face
*NL*
was
buried
in
his
arm
on
the
bench
and
he
seemed
to
be
sleeping
;
another
*NL*
man
was
standing
in
the
half-dark
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
.
K.
now
*NL*
climbed
over
the
bed
,
the
painter
followed
him
with
the
pictures
.
They
*NL*
soon
came
across
a
servant
of
the
court
-
K.
was
now
able
to
recognise
*NL*
all
the
servants
of
the
court
from
the
gold
buttons
they
wore
on
their
*NL*
civilian
clothes
below
the
normal
buttons
-
and
the
painter
instructed
*NL*
him
to
go
with
K.
carrying
the
pictures
.
K.
staggered
more
than
he
*NL*
walked
,
his
handkerchief
pressed
over
his
mouth
.
They
had
nearly
*NL*
reached
the
exit
when
the
girls
stormed
in
on
them
,
so
K.
had
not
been
*NL*
able
to
avoid
them
.
They
had
clearly
seen
that
the
second
door
of
the
*NL*
studio
had
been
opened
and
had
gone
around
to
impose
themselves
on
him
*NL*
from
this
side
.
``
I
ca
n't
come
with
you
any
further
!
''
called
out
the
*NL*
painter
with
a
laugh
as
the
girls
pressed
in
.
``
Goodbye
,
and
do
n't
*NL*
hesitate
too
long
!
''
K.
did
not
even
look
round
at
him
.
Once
on
the
*NL*
street
he
took
the
first
cab
he
came
across
.
He
now
had
to
get
rid
of
*NL*
the
servant
,
whose
gold
button
continually
caught
his
eye
even
if
it
*NL*
caught
no-one
else
's
.
As
a
servant
,
the
servant
of
the
court
was
going
*NL*
to
sit
on
the
coach-box
.
But
K.
chased
him
down
from
there
.
It
was
*NL*
already
well
into
the
afternoon
when
K.
arrived
in
front
of
the
bank
.
*NL*
He
would
have
liked
to
leave
the
pictures
in
the
cab
but
feared
there
*NL*
might
be
some
occasion
when
he
would
have
to
let
the
painter
see
he
*NL*
still
had
them
.
So
he
had
the
pictures
taken
to
his
office
and
locked
*NL*
them
in
the
lowest
drawer
of
his
desk
so
that
he
could
at
least
keep
*NL*
them
safe
from
the
deputy
director
's
view
for
the
next
few
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Eight
*NL*
Block
,
the
businessman
-
Dismissing
the
lawyer
*NL*
*NL*
K.
had
at
last
made
the
decision
to
withdraw
his
defence
from
the
*NL*
lawyer
.
It
was
impossible
to
remove
his
doubts
as
to
whether
this
was
*NL*
the
right
decision
,
but
this
was
outweighed
by
his
belief
in
its
*NL*
necessity
.
This
decision
,
on
the
day
he
intended
to
go
to
see
the
*NL*
lawyer
,
took
a
lot
of
the
strength
he
needed
for
his
work
,
he
worked
*NL*
exceptionally
slowly
,
he
had
to
remain
in
his
office
a
long
time
,
and
it
*NL*
was
already
past
ten
o'clock
when
he
finally
stood
in
front
of
the
*NL*
lawyer
's
front
door
.
Even
before
he
rang
he
considered
whether
it
might
*NL*
not
be
better
to
give
the
lawyer
notice
by
letter
or
telephone
,
a
*NL*
personal
conversation
would
certainly
be
very
difficult
.
Nonetheless
,
*NL*
K.
did
not
actually
want
to
do
without
it
,
if
he
gave
notice
by
any
*NL*
other
means
it
would
be
received
in
silence
or
with
a
few
formulated
*NL*
words
,
and
unless
Leni
could
discover
anything
K.
would
never
learn
how
*NL*
the
lawyer
had
taken
his
dismissal
and
what
its
consequences
might
be
,
*NL*
in
the
lawyer
's
not
unimportant
opinion
.
But
sitting
in
front
of
him
*NL*
and
taken
by
surprise
by
his
dismissal
,
K.
would
be
able
easily
to
infer
*NL*
everything
he
wanted
from
the
lawyer
's
face
and
behaviour
,
even
if
he
*NL*
could
not
be
induced
to
say
very
much
.
It
was
not
even
out
of
the
*NL*
question
that
K.
might
,
after
all
,
be
persuaded
that
it
would
be
best
to
*NL*
leave
his
defence
to
the
lawyer
and
withdraw
his
dismissal
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
usual
,
there
was
at
first
no
response
to
K.
's
ring
at
the
door
.
*NL*
``
Leni
could
be
a
bit
quicker
,
''
thought
K
.
But
he
could
at
least
be
glad
*NL*
there
was
nobody
else
interfering
as
usually
happened
,
be
it
the
man
in
*NL*
his
nightshirt
or
anyone
else
who
might
bother
him
.
As
K.
pressed
on
*NL*
the
button
for
the
second
time
he
looked
back
at
the
other
door
,
but
*NL*
this
time
it
,
too
,
remained
closed
.
At
last
,
two
eyes
appeared
at
the
*NL*
spy-hatch
in
the
lawyer
's
door
,
although
they
were
n't
Leni
's
eyes
.
*NL*
Someone
unlocked
the
door
,
but
kept
himself
pressed
against
it
as
he
*NL*
called
back
inside
,
``
It
's
him
!
''
,
and
only
then
did
he
open
the
door
*NL*
properly
.
K.
pushed
against
the
door
,
as
behind
him
he
could
already
*NL*
hear
the
key
being
hurriedly
turned
in
the
lock
of
the
door
to
the
other
*NL*
flat
.
When
the
door
in
front
of
him
finally
opened
,
he
stormed
straight
*NL*
into
the
hallway
.
Through
the
corridor
which
led
between
the
rooms
he
*NL*
saw
Leni
,
to
whom
the
warning
cry
of
the
door
opener
had
been
directed
,
*NL*
still
running
away
in
her
nightshirt
.
He
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
*NL*
and
then
looked
round
at
the
person
who
had
opened
the
door
.
It
was
a
*NL*
small
,
wizened
man
with
a
full
beard
,
he
held
a
candle
in
his
hand
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
work
here
?
''
asked
K.
``
No
,
''
answered
the
man
,
``
I
do
n't
belong
here
*NL*
at
all
,
the
lawyer
is
only
representing
me
,
I
'm
here
on
legal
business
.
''
*NL*
``
Without
your
coat
?
''
asked
K.
,
indicating
the
man
's
deficiency
of
dress
*NL*
with
a
gesture
of
his
hand
.
``
Oh
,
do
forgive
me
!
''
said
the
man
,
and
he
*NL*
looked
at
himself
in
the
light
of
the
candle
he
was
holding
as
if
he
had
*NL*
not
known
about
his
appearance
until
then
.
*NL*
``
Is
Leni
your
lover
?
''
asked
K.
curtly
.
He
had
set
his
legs
slightly
*NL*
apart
,
his
hands
,
in
which
he
held
his
hat
,
were
behind
his
back
.
*NL*
Merely
by
being
in
possession
of
a
thick
overcoat
he
felt
his
advantage
*NL*
over
this
thin
little
man
.
``
Oh
God
,
''
he
said
and
,
shocked
,
raised
one
*NL*
hand
in
front
of
his
face
as
if
in
defence
,
``
no
,
no
,
what
can
you
be
*NL*
thinking
?
''
``
You
look
honest
enough
,
''
said
K.
with
a
smile
,
``
but
come
*NL*
along
anyway
.
''
K.
indicated
with
his
hat
which
way
the
man
was
to
go
*NL*
and
let
him
go
ahead
of
him
.
``
What
is
your
name
then
?
''
asked
K.
on
the
*NL*
way
.
``
Block
.
I
'm
a
businessman
,
''
said
the
small
man
,
twisting
himself
*NL*
round
as
he
thus
introduced
himself
,
although
K.
did
not
allow
him
to
*NL*
stop
moving
.
``
Is
that
your
real
name
?
''
asked
K.
``
Of
course
it
is
,
''
was
*NL*
the
man
's
reply
,
``
why
do
you
doubt
it
?
''
``
I
thought
you
might
have
some
*NL*
reason
to
keep
your
name
secret
,
''
said
K
.
He
felt
himself
as
much
at
*NL*
liberty
as
is
normally
only
felt
in
foreign
parts
when
speaking
with
*NL*
people
of
lower
standing
,
keeping
everything
about
himself
to
himself
,
*NL*
speaking
only
casually
about
the
interests
of
the
other
,
able
to
raise
*NL*
him
to
a
level
above
one
's
own
,
but
also
able
,
at
will
,
to
let
him
drop
*NL*
again
.
K.
stopped
at
the
door
of
the
lawyer
's
office
,
opened
it
and
,
to
*NL*
the
businessman
who
had
obediently
gone
ahead
,
called
,
``
Not
so
fast
!
*NL*
Bring
some
light
here
!
''
K.
thought
Leni
might
have
hidden
in
here
,
he
*NL*
let
the
businessman
search
in
every
corner
,
but
the
room
was
empty
.
In
*NL*
front
of
the
picture
of
the
judge
K.
took
hold
of
the
businessman
's
*NL*
braces
to
stop
him
moving
on
.
``
Do
you
know
him
?
''
he
asked
,
pointing
*NL*
upwards
with
his
finger
.
The
businessman
lifted
the
candle
,
blinked
as
*NL*
he
looked
up
and
said
,
``
It
's
a
judge
.
''
``
An
important
judge
?
''
asked
K.
,
*NL*
and
stood
to
the
side
and
in
front
of
the
businessman
so
that
he
could
*NL*
observe
what
impression
the
picture
had
on
him
.
The
businessman
was
*NL*
looking
up
in
admiration
.
``
He
's
an
important
judge
.
''
``
You
do
n't
have
*NL*
much
insight
,
''
said
K.
``
He
is
the
lowest
of
the
lowest
examining
*NL*
judges
.
''
``
I
remember
now
,
''
said
the
businessman
as
he
lowered
the
*NL*
candle
,
``
that
's
what
I
've
already
been
told
.
''
``
Well
of
course
you
*NL*
have
,
''
called
out
K.
,
``
I
'd
forgotten
about
it
,
of
course
you
would
*NL*
already
have
been
told
.
''
``
But
why
,
why
?
''
asked
the
businessman
as
he
*NL*
moved
forwards
towards
the
door
,
propelled
by
the
hands
of
K.
Outside
*NL*
in
the
corridor
K.
said
,
*NL*
``
You
know
where
Leni
's
hidden
,
do
you
?
''
``
Hidden
?
''
said
the
businessman
,
*NL*
``
No
,
but
she
might
be
in
the
kitchen
cooking
soup
for
the
lawyer
.
''
``
Why
*NL*
did
n't
you
say
that
immediately
?
''
asked
K.
``
I
was
going
to
take
you
*NL*
there
,
but
you
called
me
back
again
,
''
answered
the
businessman
,
as
if
*NL*
confused
by
the
contradictory
commands
.
``
You
think
you
're
very
clever
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
,
''
said
K
,
``
now
take
me
there
!
''
K.
had
never
been
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
it
was
surprisingly
big
and
very
well
equipped
.
The
stove
*NL*
alone
was
three
times
bigger
than
normal
stoves
,
but
it
was
not
possible
*NL*
to
see
any
detail
beyond
this
as
the
kitchen
was
at
the
time
illuminated
*NL*
by
no
more
than
a
small
lamp
hanging
by
the
entrance
.
At
the
stove
*NL*
stood
Leni
,
in
a
white
apron
as
always
,
breaking
eggs
into
a
pot
*NL*
standing
on
a
spirit
lamp
.
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Josef
,
''
she
said
with
a
glance
sideways
.
``
Good
evening
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
,
pointing
with
one
hand
to
a
chair
in
a
corner
which
the
*NL*
businessman
was
to
sit
on
,
and
he
did
indeed
sit
down
on
it
.
K.
however
*NL*
went
very
close
behind
Leni
's
back
,
leant
over
her
shoulder
and
asked
,
*NL*
``
Who
is
this
man
?
''
Leni
put
one
hand
around
K.
as
she
stirred
the
soup
*NL*
with
the
other
,
she
drew
him
forward
toward
herself
and
said
,
``
He
's
a
*NL*
pitiful
character
,
a
poor
businessman
by
the
name
of
Block
.
Just
look
*NL*
at
him
.
''
The
two
of
them
looked
back
over
their
shoulders
.
The
*NL*
businessman
was
sitting
on
the
chair
that
K.
had
directed
him
to
,
he
had
*NL*
extinguished
the
candle
whose
light
was
no
longer
needed
and
pressed
on
*NL*
the
wick
with
his
fingers
to
stop
the
smoke
.
``
You
were
in
your
*NL*
nightshirt
,
''
said
K.
,
putting
his
hand
on
her
head
and
turning
it
back
*NL*
towards
the
stove
.
She
was
silent
.
``
Is
he
your
lover
?
''
asked
K
.
She
*NL*
was
about
to
take
hold
of
the
pot
of
soup
,
but
K.
took
both
her
hands
*NL*
and
said
,
``
Answer
me
!
''
She
said
,
``
Come
into
the
office
,
I
'll
explain
*NL*
everything
to
you
.
''
``
No
,
''
said
K.
,
``
I
want
you
to
explain
it
here
.
''
*NL*
She
put
her
arms
around
him
and
wanted
to
kiss
him
.
K.
,
though
,
pushed
*NL*
her
away
and
said
,
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
kiss
me
now
.
''
``
Josef
,
''
said
*NL*
Leni
,
looking
at
K.
imploringly
but
frankly
in
the
eyes
,
``
you
're
not
*NL*
going
to
be
jealous
of
Mr.
Block
now
,
are
you
?
Rudi
,
''
she
then
said
,
*NL*
turning
to
the
businessman
,
``
help
me
out
will
you
,
I
'm
being
suspected
*NL*
of
something
,
you
can
see
that
,
leave
the
candle
alone
.
''
It
had
looked
*NL*
as
though
Mr.
Block
had
not
been
paying
attention
but
he
had
been
*NL*
following
closely
.
``
I
do
n't
even
know
why
you
might
be
jealous
,
''
he
*NL*
said
ingenuously
.
``
Nor
do
I
,
actually
,
''
said
K.
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
businessman
with
a
smile
.
Leni
laughed
out
loud
and
while
K.
was
not
*NL*
paying
attention
took
the
opportunity
of
embracing
him
and
whispering
,
*NL*
``
Leave
him
alone
,
now
,
you
can
see
what
sort
of
person
he
is
.
I
've
been
*NL*
helping
him
a
little
bit
because
he
's
an
important
client
of
the
*NL*
lawyer
's
,
and
no
other
reason
.
And
what
about
you
?
Do
you
want
to
*NL*
speak
to
the
lawyer
at
this
time
of
day
?
He
's
very
unwell
today
,
but
if
*NL*
you
want
I
'll
tell
him
you
're
here
.
But
you
can
certainly
spend
the
*NL*
night
with
me
.
It
's
so
long
since
you
were
last
here
,
even
the
lawyer
*NL*
has
been
asking
about
you
.
Do
n't
neglect
your
case
!
And
I
've
got
some
*NL*
things
to
tell
you
that
I
've
learned
about
.
But
now
,
before
anything
*NL*
else
,
take
your
coat
off
!
''
She
helped
him
off
with
his
coat
,
took
the
*NL*
hat
off
his
head
,
ran
with
the
things
into
the
hallway
to
hang
them
up
,
*NL*
then
she
ran
back
and
saw
to
the
soup
.
``
Do
you
want
me
to
tell
him
*NL*
you
're
here
straight
away
or
take
him
his
soup
first
?
''
``
Tell
him
I
'm
*NL*
here
first
,
''
said
K
.
He
was
in
a
bad
mood
,
he
had
originally
intended
a
*NL*
detailed
discussion
of
his
business
with
Leni
,
especially
the
question
*NL*
of
his
giving
the
lawyer
notice
,
but
now
he
no
longer
wanted
to
because
*NL*
of
the
presence
of
the
businessman
.
Now
he
considered
his
affair
too
*NL*
important
to
let
this
little
businessman
take
part
in
it
and
perhaps
*NL*
change
some
of
his
decisions
,
and
so
*NL*
he
called
Leni
back
even
though
she
was
already
on
her
way
to
the
*NL*
lawyer
.
``
Bring
him
his
soup
first
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
want
him
to
get
his
*NL*
strength
up
for
the
discussion
with
me
,
he
'll
need
it
.
''
``
You
're
a
*NL*
client
of
the
lawyer
's
too
,
are
n't
you
,
''
said
the
businessman
quietly
*NL*
from
his
corner
as
if
he
were
trying
to
find
this
out
.
It
was
not
,
*NL*
however
,
taken
well
.
``
What
business
is
that
of
yours
?
''
said
K.
,
and
*NL*
Leni
said
,
*NL*
``
Will
you
be
quiet
.
-
I
'll
take
him
his
soup
first
then
,
shall
I
?
''
And
*NL*
she
poured
the
soup
into
a
dish
.
``
The
only
worry
then
is
that
he
might
*NL*
go
to
sleep
soon
after
he
's
eaten
.
''
``
What
I
've
got
to
say
to
him
will
*NL*
keep
him
awake
,
''
said
K.
,
who
still
wanted
to
intimate
that
he
intended
*NL*
some
important
negotiations
with
the
lawyer
,
he
wanted
Leni
to
ask
him
*NL*
what
it
was
and
only
then
to
ask
her
advice
.
But
instead
,
she
just
*NL*
promptly
carried
out
the
order
he
had
given
her
.
When
she
went
over
to
*NL*
him
with
the
dish
she
deliberately
brushed
against
him
and
whispered
,
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
him
you
're
here
as
soon
as
he
's
eaten
the
soup
so
that
I
can
*NL*
get
you
back
as
soon
as
possible
.
''
``
Just
go
,
''
said
K.
,
``
just
go
.
''
``
Be
*NL*
a
bit
more
friendly
,
''
she
said
and
,
still
holding
the
dish
,
turned
*NL*
completely
round
once
more
in
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
K.
watched
her
as
she
went
;
the
decision
had
finally
been
made
*NL*
that
the
lawyer
was
to
be
dismissed
,
it
was
probably
better
that
he
had
*NL*
not
been
able
to
discuss
the
matter
any
more
with
Leni
beforehand
;
she
*NL*
hardly
understood
the
complexity
of
the
matter
,
she
would
certainly
have
*NL*
advised
him
against
it
and
perhaps
would
even
have
prevented
him
from
*NL*
dismissing
the
lawyer
this
time
,
he
would
have
remained
in
doubt
and
*NL*
unease
and
eventually
have
carried
out
his
decision
after
a
while
anyway
*NL*
as
this
decision
was
something
he
could
not
avoid
.
The
sooner
it
was
*NL*
carried
out
the
more
harm
would
be
avoided
.
And
moreover
,
perhaps
the
*NL*
businessman
had
something
to
say
on
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
K.
turned
round
,
the
businessman
hardly
noticed
it
as
he
was
about
*NL*
to
stand
up
.
``
Stay
where
you
are
,
''
said
K.
and
pulled
up
a
chair
beside
*NL*
him
.
``
Have
you
been
a
client
of
the
lawyer
's
for
a
long
time
?
''
asked
K.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
``
a
very
long
time
.
''
``
How
many
years
has
he
*NL*
been
representing
you
so
far
,
then
?
''
asked
K.
``
I
do
n't
know
how
you
*NL*
mean
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
``
he
's
been
my
business
lawyer
-
I
buy
and
*NL*
sell
cereals
-
he
's
been
my
business
lawyer
since
I
took
the
business
*NL*
over
,
and
that
's
about
twenty
years
now
,
but
perhaps
you
mean
my
own
*NL*
trial
and
he
's
been
representing
me
in
that
since
it
started
,
and
that
's
*NL*
been
more
than
five
years
.
Yes
,
well
over
five
years
,
''
he
then
added
,
*NL*
pulling
out
an
old
briefcase
,
``
I
've
got
everything
written
down
;
I
can
*NL*
tell
you
the
exact
dates
if
you
like
.
It
's
so
hard
to
remember
*NL*
everything
.
Probably
,
my
trial
's
been
going
on
much
longer
than
that
,
*NL*
it
started
soon
after
the
death
of
my
wife
,
and
that
's
been
more
than
*NL*
five
and
a
half
years
now
.
''
K.
moved
in
closer
to
him
.
``
So
the
lawyer
*NL*
takes
on
ordinary
legal
business
,
does
he
?
''
he
asked
.
This
combination
*NL*
of
criminal
and
commercial
business
seemed
surprisingly
reassuring
for
*NL*
K.
``
Oh
yes
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
and
then
he
whispered
,
``
They
even
*NL*
say
he
's
more
efficient
in
jurisprudence
than
he
is
in
other
matters
.
''
*NL*
But
then
he
seemed
to
regret
saying
this
,
and
he
laid
a
hand
on
K.
's
*NL*
shoulder
and
said
,
``
Please
do
n't
betray
me
to
him
,
will
you
.
''
K.
patted
*NL*
his
thigh
to
reassure
him
and
said
,
``
No
,
I
do
n't
betray
people
.
''
``
He
*NL*
can
be
so
vindictive
,
you
see
,
''
said
the
businessman
.
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
he
wo
n't
do
anything
against
such
a
faithful
client
as
you
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
``
Oh
,
he
might
do
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
``
when
he
gets
cross
it
*NL*
does
n't
matter
who
it
is
,
and
anyway
,
I
'm
not
really
faithful
to
him
.
''
*NL*
``
How
's
that
then
?
''
asked
K.
``
I
'm
not
sure
I
should
tell
you
about
it
,
''
*NL*
said
the
businessman
hesitantly
.
``
I
think
it
'll
be
alright
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
``
Well
then
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
``
I
'll
tell
you
about
some
of
it
,
but
*NL*
you
'll
have
to
tell
me
a
secret
too
,
then
we
can
support
each
other
with
*NL*
the
lawyer
.
''
``
You
are
very
careful
,
''
said
K.
,
``
but
I
'll
tell
you
a
*NL*
secret
that
will
set
your
mind
completely
at
ease
.
Now
tell
me
,
in
what
*NL*
way
have
you
been
unfaithful
to
the
lawyer
?
''
``
I
've
...
''
said
the
*NL*
businessman
hesitantly
,
and
in
a
tone
as
if
he
were
confessing
something
*NL*
dishonourable
,
``
I
've
taken
on
other
lawyers
besides
him
.
''
``
That
's
not
*NL*
so
serious
,
''
said
K.
,
a
little
disappointed
.
``
It
is
,
here
,
''
said
the
*NL*
businessman
,
who
had
had
some
difficulty
breathing
since
making
his
*NL*
confession
but
who
now
,
after
hearing
K.
's
comment
,
began
to
feel
more
*NL*
trust
for
him
.
``
That
's
not
allowed
.
And
it
's
allowed
least
of
all
to
*NL*
take
on
petty
lawyers
when
you
've
already
got
a
proper
one
.
And
that
's
*NL*
just
what
I
have
done
,
besides
him
I
've
got
five
petty
lawyers
.
''
*NL*
``
Five
!
''
exclaimed
K.
,
astonished
at
this
number
,
``
Five
lawyers
besides
*NL*
this
one
?
''
The
businessman
nodded
.
``
I
'm
even
negotiating
with
a
sixth
*NL*
one
.
''
``
But
why
do
you
need
so
many
lawyers
?
''
asked
K.
``
I
need
all
of
*NL*
them
,
''
said
the
businessman
.
``
Would
you
mind
explaining
that
to
me
?
''
*NL*
asked
K.
``
I
'd
be
glad
to
,
''
said
the
businessman
.
``
Most
of
all
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
lose
my
case
,
well
that
's
obvious
.
So
that
means
I
must
n't
*NL*
neglect
anything
that
might
be
of
use
to
me
;
even
if
there
's
very
little
*NL*
hope
of
a
particular
thing
being
of
any
use
I
ca
n't
just
throw
it
away
.
*NL*
So
everything
I
have
I
've
put
to
use
in
my
case
.
I
've
taken
all
the
*NL*
money
out
of
my
business
,
for
example
,
the
offices
for
my
business
used
*NL*
to
occupy
nearly
a
whole
floor
,
but
now
all
I
need
is
a
little
room
at
*NL*
the
back
where
I
work
with
one
apprentice
.
It
was
n't
just
using
up
the
*NL*
money
that
caused
the
difficulty
,
of
course
,
it
was
much
more
to
do
with
*NL*
me
not
working
at
the
business
as
much
as
I
used
to
.
If
you
want
to
do
*NL*
something
about
your
trial
you
do
n't
have
much
time
for
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
``
So
you
're
also
working
at
the
court
yourself
?
''
asked
K.
``
That
's
just
*NL*
what
I
want
to
learn
more
about
.
''
``
I
ca
n't
tell
you
very
much
about
*NL*
that
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
``
at
first
I
tried
to
do
that
too
but
I
soon
*NL*
had
to
give
it
up
again
.
It
wears
you
out
too
much
,
and
it
's
really
not
*NL*
much
use
.
And
it
turned
out
to
be
quite
impossible
to
work
there
*NL*
yourself
and
to
negotiate
,
at
least
for
me
it
was
.
It
's
a
heavy
strain
*NL*
there
just
sitting
and
waiting
.
You
know
yourself
what
the
air
is
like
*NL*
in
those
offices
.
''
``
How
do
you
know
I
've
been
there
,
then
?
''
asked
K.
*NL*
``
I
was
in
the
waiting
room
myself
when
you
went
through
.
''
``
What
a
*NL*
coincidence
that
is
!
''
exclaimed
K.
,
totally
engrossed
and
forgetting
how
*NL*
ridiculous
the
businessman
had
seemed
to
him
earlier
.
``
So
you
saw
me
!
*NL*
You
were
in
the
waiting
room
when
I
went
through
.
Yes
,
I
did
go
through
*NL*
it
one
time
.
''
``
It
is
n't
such
a
big
coincidence
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
*NL*
``
I
'm
there
nearly
every
day
.
''
``
I
expect
I
'll
have
to
go
there
quite
*NL*
often
myself
now
,
''
said
K.
,
``
although
I
can
hardly
expect
to
be
shown
*NL*
the
same
respect
as
I
was
then
.
They
all
stood
up
for
me
.
They
must
*NL*
have
thought
I
was
a
judge
.
''
``
No
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
``
we
were
*NL*
greeting
the
servant
of
the
court
.
We
knew
you
were
a
defendant
.
That
*NL*
sort
of
news
spreads
very
quickly
.
''
``
So
you
already
knew
about
that
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
,
``
the
way
I
behaved
must
have
seemed
very
arrogant
to
you
.
Did
*NL*
you
criticise
me
for
it
afterwards
?
''
``
No
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
``
quite
*NL*
the
opposite
.
That
was
just
stupidity
.
''
``
What
do
you
mean
,
*NL*
`
stupidity
'
?
''
asked
K.
``
Why
are
you
asking
about
it
?
''
said
the
*NL*
businessman
in
some
irritation
.
``
You
still
do
n't
seem
to
know
the
*NL*
people
there
and
you
might
take
it
wrong
.
Do
n't
forget
in
proceedings
*NL*
like
this
there
are
always
lots
of
different
things
coming
up
to
talk
*NL*
about
,
things
that
you
just
ca
n't
understand
with
reason
alone
,
you
just
*NL*
get
too
tired
and
distracted
for
most
things
and
so
,
instead
,
people
*NL*
rely
on
superstition
.
I
'm
talking
about
the
others
,
but
I
'm
no
better
*NL*
myself
.
One
of
these
superstitions
,
for
example
,
is
that
you
can
learn
*NL*
a
lot
about
the
outcome
of
a
defendant
's
case
by
looking
at
his
face
,
*NL*
especially
the
shape
of
his
lips
.
There
are
lots
who
believe
that
,
and
*NL*
they
said
they
could
see
from
the
shape
of
your
lips
that
you
'd
*NL*
definitely
be
found
guilty
very
soon
.
I
repeat
that
all
this
is
just
a
*NL*
ridiculous
superstition
,
and
in
most
cases
it
's
completely
disproved
by
*NL*
the
facts
,
but
when
you
live
in
that
society
it
's
hard
to
hold
yourself
*NL*
back
from
beliefs
like
that
.
Just
think
how
much
effect
that
*NL*
superstition
can
have
.
You
spoke
to
one
of
them
there
,
did
n't
you
?
He
*NL*
was
hardly
able
to
give
you
an
answer
.
There
are
lots
of
things
there
*NL*
that
can
make
you
confused
,
of
course
,
but
one
of
them
,
for
him
,
was
the
*NL*
appearance
of
your
lips
.
He
told
us
all
later
he
thought
he
could
see
*NL*
something
in
your
lips
that
meant
he
'd
be
convicted
himself
.
''
``
On
my
*NL*
lips
?
''
asked
K.
,
pulling
out
a
pocket
mirror
and
examining
himself
.
``
I
*NL*
can
see
nothing
special
about
my
lips
.
Can
you
?
''
``
Nor
can
I
,
''
said
the
*NL*
businessman
,
``
nothing
at
all
.
''
``
These
people
are
so
superstitious
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
K.
``
Is
n't
that
what
I
just
told
you
?
''
asked
the
businessman
.
*NL*
``
Do
you
then
have
that
much
contact
with
each
other
,
exchanging
each
*NL*
other
's
opinions
?
''
said
K.
``
I
've
kept
myself
completely
apart
so
far
.
''
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
normally
have
much
contact
with
each
other
,
''
said
the
*NL*
businessman
,
``
that
would
be
impossible
,
there
are
so
many
of
them
.
And
*NL*
they
do
n't
have
much
in
common
either
.
If
a
group
of
them
ever
thinks
*NL*
they
have
found
something
in
common
it
soon
turns
out
they
were
*NL*
mistaken
.
There
's
nothing
you
can
do
as
a
group
where
the
court
's
*NL*
concerned
.
Each
case
is
examined
separately
,
the
court
is
very
*NL*
painstaking
.
So
there
's
nothing
to
be
achieved
by
forming
into
a
group
,
*NL*
only
sometimes
an
individual
will
achieve
something
in
secret
;
and
it
's
*NL*
only
when
that
's
been
done
the
others
learn
about
it
;
nobody
knows
how
*NL*
it
was
done
.
So
there
's
no
sense
of
togetherness
,
you
meet
people
now
*NL*
and
then
in
the
waiting
rooms
,
but
we
do
n't
talk
much
there
.
The
*NL*
superstitious
beliefs
were
established
a
long
time
ago
and
they
spread
*NL*
all
by
themselves
.
''
``
I
saw
those
gentlemen
in
the
waiting
room
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
,
``
it
seemed
so
pointless
for
them
to
be
waiting
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
``
Waiting
is
not
pointless
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
``
it
's
only
pointless
*NL*
if
you
try
and
interfere
yourself
.
I
told
you
just
now
I
've
got
five
*NL*
lawyers
besides
this
one
.
You
might
think
-
I
thought
it
myself
at
*NL*
first
-
you
might
think
I
could
leave
the
whole
thing
entirely
up
to
*NL*
them
now
.
That
would
be
entirely
wrong
.
I
can
leave
it
up
to
them
less
*NL*
than
when
I
had
just
the
one
.
Maybe
you
do
n't
understand
that
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
K.
,
and
to
slow
the
businessman
down
,
who
had
been
speaking
*NL*
too
fast
,
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
businessman
's
to
reassure
him
,
``
but
*NL*
I
'd
like
just
to
ask
you
to
speak
a
little
more
slowly
,
these
are
many
*NL*
very
important
things
for
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
follow
exactly
what
you
're
*NL*
saying
.
''
``
You
're
quite
right
to
remind
me
of
that
,
''
said
the
*NL*
businessman
,
``
you
're
new
to
all
this
,
a
junior
.
Your
trial
is
six
*NL*
months
old
,
is
n't
it
?
Yes
,
I
've
heard
about
it
.
Such
a
new
case
!
But
*NL*
I
've
already
thought
all
these
things
through
countless
times
,
to
me
*NL*
they
're
the
most
obvious
things
in
the
world
.
''
``
You
must
be
glad
your
*NL*
trial
has
already
progressed
so
far
,
are
you
?
''
asked
K.
,
he
did
not
wish
*NL*
to
ask
directly
how
the
businessman
's
affairs
stood
,
but
received
no
*NL*
clear
answer
anyway
.
``
Yes
,
I
've
been
working
at
my
trial
for
five
years
*NL*
now
,
''
said
the
businessman
as
his
head
sank
,
``
that
's
no
small
*NL*
achievement
.
''
Then
he
was
silent
for
a
while
.
K.
listened
to
hear
*NL*
whether
Leni
was
on
her
way
back
.
On
the
one
hand
he
did
not
want
her
*NL*
to
come
back
too
soon
as
he
still
had
many
questions
to
ask
and
did
not
*NL*
want
her
to
find
him
in
this
intimate
discussion
with
the
businessman
,
*NL*
but
on
the
other
hand
it
irritated
him
that
she
stayed
so
long
with
the
*NL*
lawyer
when
K.
was
there
,
much
longer
than
she
needed
to
give
him
his
*NL*
soup
.
``
I
still
remember
it
exactly
,
''
the
businessman
began
again
,
and
*NL*
K.
immediately
gave
him
his
full
attention
,
``
when
my
case
was
as
old
as
*NL*
yours
is
now
.
I
only
had
this
one
lawyer
at
that
time
but
I
was
n't
very
*NL*
satisfied
with
him
.
''
Now
I
'll
find
out
everything
,
thought
K.
,
nodding
*NL*
vigorously
as
if
he
could
thereby
encourage
the
businessman
to
say
*NL*
everything
worth
knowing
.
``
My
case
,
''
the
businessman
continued
,
``
did
n't
*NL*
move
on
at
all
,
there
were
some
hearings
that
took
place
and
I
went
to
*NL*
every
one
of
them
,
collected
materials
,
handed
all
my
business
books
to
*NL*
the
court
-
which
I
later
found
was
entirely
unnecessary
-
I
ran
back
*NL*
and
forth
to
the
lawyer
,
and
he
submitted
various
documents
to
the
court
*NL*
too
...
''
``
Various
documents
?
''
asked
K.
``
Yes
,
that
's
right
,
''
said
the
*NL*
businessman
.
``
That
's
very
important
for
me
,
''
said
K.
,
``
in
my
case
he
's
*NL*
still
working
on
the
first
set
of
documents
.
He
still
has
n't
done
*NL*
anything
.
I
see
now
that
he
's
been
neglecting
me
quite
disgracefully
.
''
*NL*
``
There
can
be
lots
of
good
reasons
why
the
first
documents
still
are
n't
*NL*
ready
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
``
and
anyway
,
it
turned
out
later
on
that
*NL*
the
ones
he
submitted
for
me
were
entirely
worthless
.
I
even
read
one
*NL*
of
them
myself
,
one
of
the
officials
at
the
court
was
very
helpful
.
It
*NL*
was
very
learned
,
but
it
did
n't
actually
say
anything
.
Most
of
all
,
*NL*
there
was
lots
of
Latin
,
which
I
ca
n't
understand
,
then
pages
and
pages
*NL*
of
general
appeals
to
the
court
,
then
lots
of
flattery
for
particular
*NL*
officials
,
they
were
n't
named

these
officials
,
but
anyone
familiar
with
*NL*
the
court
must
have
been
able
to
guess
who
they
were
,
then
there
was
*NL*
self-praise
by
the
lawyer
where
he
humiliated
himself
to
the
court
in
a
*NL*
way
that
was
downright
dog-like
,
and
then
endless
investigations
of
*NL*
cases
from
the
past
which
were
supposed
to
be
similar
to
mine
.
*NL*
Although
,
as
far
as
I
was
able
to
follow
them
,
these
investigations
had
*NL*
been
carried
out
very
carefully
.
Now
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
criticise
the
*NL*
lawyer
's
work
with
all
of
this
,
and
the
document
I
read
was
only
one
of
*NL*
many
,
but
even
so
,
and
this
is
something
I
will
say
,
at
that
time
I
*NL*
could
n't
see
any
progress
in
my
trial
at
all
.
''
``
And
what
sort
of
*NL*
progress
had
you
been
hoping
for
?
''
asked
K.
``
That
's
a
very
sensible
*NL*
question
,
''
said
the
businessman
with
a
smile
,
``
it
's
only
very
rare
that
*NL*
you
see
any
progress
in
these
proceedings
at
all
.
But
I
did
n't
know
*NL*
that
then
.
I
'm
a
businessman
,
much
more
in
those
days
than
now
,
I
*NL*
wanted
to
see
some
tangible
progress
,
it
should
have
all
been
moving
to
*NL*
some
conclusion
or
at
least
should
have
been
moving
on
in
some
way
*NL*
according
to
the
rules
.
Instead
of
which
there
were
just
more
hearings
,
*NL*
and
most
of
them
went
through
the
same
things
anyway
;
I
had
all
the
*NL*
answers
off
pat
like
in
a
church
service
;
there
were
messengers
from
the
*NL*
court
coming
to
me
at
work
several
times
a
week
,
or
they
came
to
me
at
*NL*
home
or
anywhere
else
they
could
find
me
;
and
that
was
very
disturbing
*NL*
of
course
-LRB-
but
at
least
now
things
are
better
in
that
respect
,
it
's
much
*NL*
less
disturbing
when
they
contact
you
by
telephone
-RRB-
,
and
rumours
about
*NL*
my
trial
even
started
to
spread
among
some
of
the
people
I
do
business
*NL*
with
,
and
especially
my
relations
,
so
I
was
being
made
to
suffer
in
many
*NL*
different
ways
but
there
was
still
not
the
slightest
sign
that
even
the
*NL*
first
hearing
would
take
place
soon
.
So
I
went
to
the
lawyer
and
*NL*
complained
about
it
.
He
explained
it
all
to
me
at
length
,
but
refused
*NL*
to
do
anything
I
asked
for
,
no-one
has
any
influence
on
the
way
the
*NL*
trial
proceeds
,
he
said
,
to
try
and
insist
on
it
in
any
of
the
documents
*NL*
submitted
-
like
I
was
asking
-
was
simply
unheard
of
and
would
do
harm
*NL*
to
both
him
and
me
.
I
thought
to
myself
:
What
this
lawyer
ca
n't
or
*NL*
wo
n't
do
another
lawyer
will
.
So
I
looked
round
for
other
lawyers
.
And
*NL*
before
you
say
anything
:
none
of
them
asked
for
a
definite
date
for
the
*NL*
main
trial
and
none
of
them
got
one
,
and
anyway
,
apart
from
one
*NL*
exception
which
I
'll
talk
about
in
a
minute
,
it
really
is
impossible
,
*NL*
that
's
one
thing
this
lawyer
did
n't
mislead
me
about
;
but
besides
,
I
had
*NL*
no
reason
to
regret
turning
to
other
lawyers
.
Perhaps
you
've
already
*NL*
heard
how
Dr.
Huld
talks
about
the
petty
lawyers
,
he
probably
made
them
*NL*
sound
very
contemptible
to
you
,
and
he
's
right
,
they
are
contemptible
.
*NL*
But
when
he
talks
about
them
and
compares
them
with
himself
and
his
*NL*
colleagues
there
's
a
small
error
running
through
what
he
says
,
and
,
just
*NL*
for
your
interest
,
I
'll
tell
you
about
it
.
When
he
talks
about
the
*NL*
lawyers
he
mixes
with
he
sets
them
apart
by
calling
them
the
`
great
*NL*
lawyers
'
.
That
's
wrong
,
anyone
can
call
himself
`
great
'
if
he
wants
to
,
*NL*
of
course
,
but
in
this
case
only
the
usage
of
the
court
can
make
that
*NL*
distinction
.
You
see
,
the
court
says
that
besides
the
petty
lawyers
*NL*
there
are
also
minor
lawyers
and
great
lawyers
.
This
one
and
his
*NL*
colleagues
are
only
minor
lawyers
,
and
the
difference
in
rank
between
*NL*
them
and
the
great
lawyers
,
who
I
've
only
ever
heard
about
and
never
*NL*
seen
,
is
incomparably
greater
than
between
the
minor
lawyers
and
the
*NL*
despised
petty
lawyers
.
''
``
The
great
lawyers
?
''
asked
K.
``
Who
are
they
*NL*
then
?
How
do
you
contact
them
?
''
``
You
've
never
heard
about
them
,
then
?
''
*NL*
said
the
businessman
.
``
There
's
hardly
anyone
who
's
been
accused
who
*NL*
does
n't
spend
a
lot
of
time
dreaming
about
the
great
lawyers
once
he
's
*NL*
heard
about
them
.
It
's
best
if
you
do
n't
let
yourself
be
misled
in
that
*NL*
way
.
I
do
n't
know
who
the
great
lawyers
are
,
and
there
's
probably
no
*NL*
way
of
contacting
them
.
I
do
n't
know
of
any
case
I
can
talk
about
with
*NL*
certainty
where
they
've
taken
any
part
.
They
do
defend
a
lot
of
people
,
*NL*
but
you
ca
n't
get
hold
of
them
by
your
own
efforts
,
they
only
defend
*NL*
those
who
they
want
to
defend
.
And
I
do
n't
suppose
they
ever
take
on
*NL*
cases
that
have
n't
already
got
past
the
lower
courts
.
Anyway
,
it
's
best
*NL*
not
to
think
about
them
,
as
if
you
do
it
makes
the
discussions
with
the
*NL*
other
lawyers
,
all
their
advice
and
all
that
they
do
manage
to
achieve
,
*NL*
seem
so
unpleasant
and
useless
,
I
had
that
experience
myself
,
just
*NL*
wanted
to
throw
everything
away
and
lay
at
home
in
bed
and
hear
nothing
*NL*
more
about
it
.
But
that
,
of
course
,
would
be
the
stupidest
thing
you
*NL*
could
do
,
and
you
would
n't
be
left
in
peace
in
bed
for
very
long
*NL*
either
.
''
``
So
you
were
n't
thinking
about
the
great
lawyers
at
that
*NL*
time
?
''
asked
K.
``
Not
for
very
long
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
and
smiled
*NL*
again
,
``
you
ca
n't
forget
about
them
entirely
,
I
'm
afraid
,
especially
in
*NL*
the
night
when
these
thoughts
come
so
easily
.
But
I
wanted
immediate
*NL*
results
in
those
days
,
so
I
went
to
the
petty
lawyers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
look
at
you
two
sat
huddled
together
!
''
called
Leni
as
she
*NL*
came
back
with
the
dish
and
stood
in
the
doorway
.
They
were
indeed
sat
*NL*
close
together
,
if
either
of
them
turned
his
head
even
slightly
it
would
*NL*
have
knocked
against
the
other
's
,
the
businessman
was
not
only
very
*NL*
small
but
also
sat
hunched
down
,
so
that
K.
was
also
forced
to
bend
down
*NL*
low
if
he
wanted
to
hear
everything
.
``
Not
quite
yet
!
''
called
out
K.
,
to
*NL*
turn
Leni
away
,
his
hand
,
still
resting
on
the
businessman
's
hand
,
*NL*
twitching
with
impatience
.
``
He
wanted
me
to
tell
him
about
my
trial
,
''
*NL*
said
the
businessman
to
Leni
.
``
Carry
on
,
then
,
carry
on
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
She
spoke
to
the
businessman
with
affection
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
with
*NL*
condescension
.
K.
did
not
like
that
,
he
had
begun
to
learn
that
the
man
*NL*
was
of
some
value
after
all
,
he
had
experience
at
least
,
and
he
was
*NL*
willing
to
share
it
.
Leni
was
probably
wrong
about
him
.
He
watched
her
*NL*
in
irritation
as
Leni
now
took
the
candle
from
the
businessman
's
hand
-
*NL*
which
he
had
been
holding
on
to
all
this
time
-
wiped
his
hand
with
her
*NL*
apron
and
then
knelt
beside
him
to
scratch
off
some
wax
that
had
dripped
*NL*
from
the
candle
onto
his
trousers
.
``
You
were
about
to
tell
me
about
the
*NL*
petty
lawyers
,
''
said
K.
,
shoving
Leni
's
hand
away
with
no
further
*NL*
comment
.
``
What
's
wrong
with
you
today
?
''
asked
Leni
,
tapped
him
gently
*NL*
and
carried
on
with
what
she
had
been
doing
.
``
Yes
,
the
petty
lawyers
,
''
*NL*
said
the
businessman
,
putting
his
hand
to
his
brow
as
if
thinking
hard
.
*NL*
K.
wanted
to
help
him
and
said
,
``
You
wanted
immediate
results
and
so
*NL*
went
to
the
petty
lawyers
.
''
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
right
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
but
did
not
continue
with
*NL*
what
he
'd
been
saying
.
``
Maybe
he
does
n't
want
to
speak
about
it
in
*NL*
front
of
Leni
,
''
thought
K.
,
suppressing
his
impatience
to
hear
the
rest
*NL*
straight
away
,
and
stopped
trying
to
press
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
told
him
I
'm
here
?
''
he
asked
Leni
.
``
Course
I
have
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
``
he
's
waiting
for
you
.
Leave
Block
alone
now
,
you
can
talk
to
*NL*
Block
later
,
he
'll
still
be
here
.
''
K.
still
hesitated
.
``
You
'll
still
*NL*
be
here
?
''
he
asked
the
businessman
,
wanting
to
hear
the
answer
from
him
*NL*
and
not
wanting
Leni
to
speak
about
the
businessman
as
if
he
were
n't
*NL*
there
,
he
was
full
of
secret
resentment
towards
Leni
today
.
And
once
*NL*
more
it
was
only
Leni
who
answered
.
``
He
often
sleeps
here
.
''
``
He
sleeps
*NL*
here
?
''
exclaimed
K.
,
he
had
thought
the
businessman
would
just
wait
*NL*
there
for
him
while
he
quickly
settled
his
business
with
the
lawyer
,
and
*NL*
then
they
would
leave
together
to
discuss
everything
thoroughly
and
*NL*
undisturbed
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
Leni
,
``
not
everyone
's
like
you
,
Josef
,
allowed
*NL*
to
see
the
lawyer
at
any
time
you
like
.
Do
do
n't
even
seem
surprised
*NL*
that
the
lawyer
,
despite
being
ill
,
still
receives
you
at
eleven
o'clock
*NL*
at
night
.
You
take
it
far
too
much
for
granted
,
what
your
friends
do
*NL*
for
you
.
Well
,
your
friends
,
or
at
least
I
do
,
we
like
to
do
things
for
*NL*
you
.
I
do
n't
want
or
need
any
more
thanks
than
that
you
're
fond
of
me
.
''
*NL*
``
Fond
of
you
?
''
thought
K.
at
first
,
and
only
then
it
occurred
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
I
am
fond
of
her
.
''
Nonetheless
,
what
he
said
,
forgetting
all
*NL*
the
rest
,
was
,
``
He
receives
me
because
I
am
his
client
.
If
I
needed
*NL*
anyone
else
's
help
I
'd
have
to
beg
and
show
gratitude
whenever
I
do
*NL*
anything
.
''
``
He
's
really
nasty
today
,
is
n't
he
?
''
Leni
asked
the
*NL*
businessman
.
``
Now
it
's
me
who
's
not
here
,
''
thought
K.
,
and
nearly
lost
*NL*
his
temper
with
the
businessman
when
,
with
the
same
rudeness
as
Leni
,
he
*NL*
said
,
``
The
lawyer
also
has
other
reasons
to
receive
him
.
His
case
is
*NL*
much
more
interesting
than
mine
.
And
it
's
only
in
its
early
stages
too
,
*NL*
it
probably
has
n't
progressed
very
far
so
the
lawyer
still
likes
to
deal
*NL*
with
him
.
That
'll
all
change
later
on
.
''
``
Yeah
,
yeah
,
''
said
Leni
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
businessman
and
laughing
.
``
He
does
n't
half
talk
!
''
she
*NL*
said
,
turning
to
face
K.
``
You
ca
n't
believe
a
word
he
says
.
He
's
as
*NL*
talkative
as
he
is
sweet
.
Maybe
that
's
why
the
lawyer
ca
n't
stand
him
.
*NL*
At
least
,
he
only
sees
him
when
he
's
in
the
right
mood
.
I
've
already
*NL*
tried
hard
to
change
that
but
it
's
impossible
.
Just
think
,
there
are
*NL*
times
when
I
tell
him
Block
's
here
and
he
does
n't
receive
him
until
*NL*
three
days
later
.
And
if
Block
is
n't
on
the
spot
when
he
's
called
then
*NL*
everything
's
lost
and
it
all
has
to
start
all
over
again
.
That
's
why
I
*NL*
let
Block
sleep
here
,
it
would
n't
be
the
first
time
Dr.
Huld
has
wanted
*NL*
to
see
him
in
the
night
.
So
now
Block
is
ready
for
that
.
Sometimes
,
*NL*
when
he
knows
Block
is
still
here
,
he
'll
even
change
his
mind
about
*NL*
letting
him
in
to
see
him
.
''
K.
looked
questioningly
at
the
businessman
.
*NL*
The
latter
nodded
and
,
although
he
had
spoken
quite
openly
with
K.
*NL*
earlier
,
seemed
to
be
confused
with
shame
as
he
said
,
``
Yes
,
later
on
you
*NL*
become
very
dependent
on
your
lawyer
.
''
``
He
's
only
pretending
to
mind
,
''
*NL*
said
Leni
.
``
He
likes
to
sleep
here
really
,
he
's
often
said
so
.
''
She
*NL*
went
over
to
a
little
door
and
shoved
it
open
.
``
Do
you
want
to
see
his
*NL*
bedroom
?
''
she
asked
.
K.
went
over
to
the
low
,
windowless
room
and
*NL*
looked
in
from
the
doorway
.
The
room
contained
a
narrow
bed
which
*NL*
filled
it
completely
,
so
that
to
get
into
the
bed
you
would
need
to
*NL*
climb
over
the
bedpost
.
At
the
head
of
the
bed
there
was
a
niche
in
the
*NL*
wall
where
,
fastidiously
tidy
,
stood
a
candle
,
a
bottle
of
ink
,
and
a
*NL*
pen
with
a
bundle
of
papers
which
were
probably
to
do
with
the
trial
.
*NL*
``
You
sleep
in
the
maid
's
room
?
''
asked
K.
,
as
he
went
back
to
the
*NL*
businessman
.
``
Leni
's
let
me
have
it
,
''
answered
the
businessman
,
``
it
has
*NL*
many
advantages
.
''
K.
looked
long
at
him
;
his
first
impression
of
the
*NL*
businessman
had
perhaps
not
been
right
;
he
had
experience
as
his
trial
*NL*
had
already
lasted
a
long
time
,
but
he
had
paid
a
heavy
price
for
this
*NL*
experience
.
K.
was
suddenly
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
the
businessman
*NL*
any
longer
.
``
Bring
him
to
bed
,
then
!
''
he
called
out
to
Leni
,
who
seemed
*NL*
to
understand
him
.
For
himself
,
he
wanted
to
go
to
the
lawyer
and
,
by
*NL*
dismissing
him
,
free
himself
from
not
only
the
lawyer
but
also
from
Leni
*NL*
and
the
businessman
.
But
before
he
had
reached
the
door
the
businessman
*NL*
spoke
to
him
gently
.
``
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
and
K.
looked
round
*NL*
crossly
.
``
You
've
forgotten
your
promise
,
''
said
the
businessman
,
*NL*
stretching
his
hand
out
to
K.
imploringly
from
where
he
sat
.
``
You
were
*NL*
going
to
tell
me
a
secret
.
''
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
K.
,
as
he
glanced
at
*NL*
Leni
,
who
was
watching
him
carefully
,
to
check
on
her
.
``
So
listen
;
it
's
*NL*
hardly
a
secret
now
anyway
.
I
'm
going
to
see
the
lawyer
now
to
sack
*NL*
him
.
''
``
He
's
sacking
him
!
''
yelled
the
businessman
,
and
he
jumped
up
from
*NL*
his
chair
and
ran
around
the
kitchen
with
his
arms
in
the
air
.
He
kept
*NL*
on
shouting
,
``
He
's
sacking
his
lawyer
!
''
Leni
tried
to
rush
at
K.
but
*NL*
the
businessman
got
in
her
way
so
that
she
shoved
him
away
with
her
*NL*
fists
.
Then
,
still
with
her
hands
balled
into
fists
,
she
ran
after
K.
*NL*
who
,
however
,
had
been
given
a
long
start
.
He
was
already
inside
the
*NL*
lawyer
's
room
by
the
time
Leni
caught
up
with
him
.
He
had
almost
closed
*NL*
the
door
behind
himself
,
but
Leni
held
the
door
open
with
her
foot
,
*NL*
grabbed
his
arm
and
tried
to
pull
him
back
.
But
he
put
such
pressure
on
*NL*
her
wrist
that
,
with
a
sigh
,
she
was
forced
to
release
him
.
She
did
not
*NL*
dare
go
into
the
room
straight
away
,
and
K.
locked
the
door
with
the
*NL*
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
waiting
for
you
a
very
long
time
,
''
said
the
lawyer
from
*NL*
his
bed
.
He
had
been
reading
something
by
the
light
of
a
candle
but
now
*NL*
he
laid
it
onto
the
bedside
table
and
put
his
glasses
on
,
looking
at
K.
*NL*
sharply
through
them
.
Instead
of
apologising
K.
said
,
``
I
'll
be
leaving
*NL*
again
soon
.
''
As
he
had
not
apologised
the
lawyer
ignored
what
K.
said
,
*NL*
and
replied
,
``
I
wo
n't
let
you
in
this
late
again
next
time
.
''
``
I
find
*NL*
that
quite
acceptable
,
''
said
K
.
The
lawyer
looked
at
him
quizzically
.
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
he
said
.
``
As
you
wish
,
''
said
K.
,
drawing
a
chair
up
to
the
*NL*
bedside
table
and
sitting
down
.
*NL*
``
It
seemed
to
me
that
you
locked
the
door
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
,
``
it
was
because
of
Leni
.
''
He
had
no
intention
of
letting
*NL*
anyone
off
lightly
.
But
the
lawyer
asked
him
,
``
Was
she
being
*NL*
importunate
again
?
''
``
Importunate
?
''
asked
K.
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
*NL*
laughing
as
he
did
so
,
had
a
fit
of
coughing
and
then
,
once
it
had
*NL*
passed
,
began
to
laugh
again
.
``
I
'm
sure
you
must
have
noticed
how
*NL*
importunate
she
can
be
sometimes
,
''
he
said
,
and
patted
K.
's
hand
which
*NL*
K.
had
rested
on
the
bedside
table
and
which
he
now
snatched
back
.
``
You
*NL*
do
n't
attach
much
importance
to
it
,
then
,
''
said
the
lawyer
when
K.
was
*NL*
silent
,
``
so
much
the
better
.
Otherwise
I
might
have
needed
to
apologise
*NL*
to
you
.
It
is
a
peculiarity
of
Leni
's
.
I
've
long
since
forgiven
her
*NL*
for
it
,
and
I
would
n't
be
talking
of
it
now
,
if
you
had
n't
locked
the
*NL*
door
just
now
.
Anyway
,
perhaps
I
should
at
least
explain
this
*NL*
peculiarity
of
hers
to
you
,
but
you
seem
rather
disturbed
,
the
way
*NL*
you
're
looking
at
me
,
and
so
that
's
why
I
'll
do
it
,
this
peculiarity
of
*NL*
hers
consists
in
this
;
Leni
finds
most
of
the
accused
attractive
.
She
*NL*
attaches
herself
to
each
of
them
,
loves
each
of
them
,
even
seems
to
be
*NL*
loved
by
each
of
them
;
then
she
sometimes
entertains
me
by
telling
me
*NL*
about
them
when
I
allow
her
to
.
I
am
not
so
astonished
by
all
of
this
*NL*
as
you
seem
to
be
.
If
you
look
at
them
in
the
right
way
the
accused
*NL*
really
can
be
attractive
,
quite
often
.
But
that
is
a
remarkable
and
to
*NL*
some
extent
scientific
phenomenon
.
Being
indicted
does
not
cause
any
*NL*
clear
,
precisely
definable
change
in
a
person
's
appearance
,
of
course
.
*NL*
But
it
's
not
like
with
other
legal
matters
,
most
of
them
remain
in
their
*NL*
usual
way
of
life
and
,
if
they
have
a
good
lawyer
looking
after
them
,
*NL*
the
trial
does
n't
get
in
their
way
.
But
there
are
nonetheless
those
who
*NL*
have
experience
in
these
matters
who
can
look
at
a
crowd
,
however
big
,
*NL*
and
tell
you
which
among
them
is
facing
a
charge
.
How
can
they
do
that
,
*NL*
you
will
ask
.
My
answer
will
not
please
you
.
It
is
simply
that
those
*NL*
who
are
facing
a
charge
are
the
most
attractive
.
It
can
not
be
their
*NL*
guilt
that
makes
them
attractive
as
not
all
of
them
are
guilty
-
at
*NL*
least
that
's
what
I
,
as
a
lawyer
,
have
to
say
-
and
nor
can
it
be
the
*NL*
proper
punishment
that
has
made
them
attractive
as
not
all
of
them
are
*NL*
punished
,
so
it
can
only
be
that
the
proceedings
levelled
against
them
*NL*
take
some
kind
of
hold
on
them
.
Whatever
the
reason
,
some
of
these
*NL*
attractive
people
are
indeed
very
attractive
.
But
all
of
them
are
*NL*
attractive
,
even
Block
,
pitiful
worm
that
he
is
.
''
As
the
lawyer
*NL*
finished
what
he
was
saying
,
K.
was
fully
in
control
of
himself
,
he
had
*NL*
even
nodded
conspicuously
at
his
last
few
words
in
order
to
confirm
to
*NL*
himself
the
view
he
had
already
formed
;
that
the
lawyer
was
trying
to
*NL*
confuse
him
,
as
he
always
did
,
by
making
general
and
irrelevant
*NL*
observations
,
and
thus
distract
him
from
the
main
question
of
what
he
*NL*
was
actually
doing
for
K.
's
trial
.
The
lawyer
must
have
noticed
that
K.
*NL*
was
offering
him
more
resistance
than
before
,
as
he
became
silent
,
*NL*
giving
K.
the
chance
to
speak
himself
,
and
then
,
as
K.
also
remained
*NL*
silent
,
he
asked
,
``
Did
you
have
a
particular
reason
for
coming
to
see
me
*NL*
today
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
K.
,
putting
his
hand
up
to
slightly
shade
his
eyes
*NL*
from
the
light
of
the
candle
so
that
he
could
see
the
lawyer
better
,
``
I
*NL*
wanted
to
tell
you
that
I
'm
withdrawing
my
representation
from
you
,
with
*NL*
immediate
effect
.
''
``
Do
I
understand
you
rightly
?
''
asked
the
lawyer
as
*NL*
he
half
raised
himself
in
his
bed
and
supported
himself
with
one
hand
on
*NL*
the
pillow
.
``
I
think
you
do
,
''
said
K.
,
sitting
stiffly
upright
as
if
*NL*
waiting
in
ambush
.
``
Well
we
can
certainly
discuss
this
plan
of
yours
,
''
*NL*
said
the
lawyer
after
a
pause
.
``
It
's
not
a
plan
any
more
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
``
That
may
be
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
``
but
we
still
must
n't
rush
anything
.
''
*NL*
He
used
the
word
`
we
'
,
as
if
he
had
no
intention
of
letting
K.
go
free
,
*NL*
and
as
if
,
even
if
he
could
no
longer
represent
him
,
he
could
still
at
*NL*
least
continue
as
his
adviser
.
``
Nothing
is
being
rushed
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
standing
slowly
up
and
going
behind
his
chair
,
``
everything
has
been
well
*NL*
thought
out
and
probably
even
for
too
long
.
The
decision
is
final
.
''
*NL*
``
Then
allow
me
to
say
a
few
words
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
throwing
the
bed
*NL*
cover
to
one
side
and
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
.
His
naked
,
white
-
*NL*
haired
legs
shivered
in
the
cold
.
He
asked
K.
to
pass
him
a
blanket
*NL*
from
the
couch
.
K.
passed
him
the
blanket
and
said
,
``
You
are
running
*NL*
the
risk
of
catching
cold
for
no
reason
.
''
``
The
circumstances
are
*NL*
important
enough
,
''
said
the
lawyer
as
he
wrapped
the
bed
cover
around
*NL*
the
top
half
of
his
body
and
then
the
blanket
around
his
legs
.
``
Your
*NL*
uncle
is
my
friend
and
in
the
course
of
time
I
've
become
fond
of
you
as
*NL*
well
.
I
admit
that
quite
openly
.
There
's
nothing
in
that
for
me
to
be
*NL*
ashamed
of
.
''
It
was
very
unwelcome
for
K.
to
hear
the
old
man
speak
in
*NL*
this
touching
way
,
as
it
forced
him
to
explain
himself
more
fully
,
which
*NL*
he
would
rather
have
avoided
,
and
he
was
aware
that
it
also
confused
him
*NL*
even
though
it
could
never
make
him
reverse
his
decision
.
``
Thank
you
*NL*
for
feeling
so
friendly
toward
me
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
also
realise
how
*NL*
deeply
involved
you
've
been
in
my
case
,
as
deeply
as
possible
for
*NL*
yourself
and
to
bring
as
much
advantage
as
possible
to
me
.
Nonetheless
,
*NL*
I
have
recently
come
to
the
conviction
that
it
is
not
enough
.
I
would
*NL*
naturally
never
attempt
,
considering
that
you
are
so
much
older
and
more
*NL*
experienced
than
I
am
,
to
convince
you
of
my
opinion
;
if
I
have
ever
*NL*
unintentionally
done
so
then
I
beg
your
forgiveness
,
but
,
as
you
have
*NL*
just
said
yourself
,
the
circumstances
are
important
enough
and
it
is
my
*NL*
belief
that
my
trial
needs
to
be
approached
with
much
more
vigour
than
*NL*
has
so
far
been
the
case
.
''
``
I
see
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
``
you
've
become
*NL*
impatient
.
''
``
I
am
not
impatient
,
''
said
K.
,
with
some
irritation
and
he
*NL*
stopped
paying
so
much
attention
to
his
choice
of
words
.
``
When
I
first
*NL*
came
here
with
my
uncle
you
probably
noticed
I
was
n't
greatly
concerned
*NL*
about
my
case
,
and
if
I
was
n't
reminded
of
it
by
force
,
as
it
were
,
I
*NL*
would
forget
about
it
completely
.
But
my
uncle
insisted
I
should
allow
*NL*
you
to
represent
me
and
I
did
so
as
a
favour
to
him
.
I
could
have
*NL*
expected
the
case
to
be
less
of
a
burden
than
it
had
been
,
as
the
point
*NL*
of
taking
on
a
lawyer
is
that
he
should
take
on
some
of
its
weight
.
But
*NL*
what
actually
happened
was
the
opposite
.
Before
,
the
trial
was
never
*NL*
such
a
worry
for
me
as
it
has
been
since
you
've
been
representing
me
.
*NL*
When
I
was
by
myself
I
never
did
anything
about
my
case
,
I
was
hardly
*NL*
aware
of
it
,
but
then
,
once
there
was
someone
representing
me
,
*NL*
everything
was
set
for
something
to
happen
,
I
was
always
,
without
cease
,
*NL*
waiting
for
you
to
do
something
,
getting
more
and
more
tense
,
but
you
*NL*
did
nothing
.
I
did
get
some
information
about
the
court
from
you
that
I
*NL*
probably
could
not
have
got
anywhere
else
,
but
that
ca
n't
be
enough
when
*NL*
the
trial
,
supposedly
in
secret
,
is
getting
closer
and
closer
to
me
.
''
*NL*
K.
had
pushed
the
chair
away
and
stood
erect
,
his
hands
in
the
pockets
*NL*
of
his
frock
coat
.
``
After
a
certain
point
in
the
proceedings
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lawyer
quietly
and
calmly
,
``
nothing
new
of
any
importance
ever
happens
.
*NL*
So
many
litigants
,
at
the
same
stage
in
their
trials
,
have
stood
before
*NL*
me
just
like
you
are
now
and
spoken
in
the
same
way
.
''
``
Then
these
other
*NL*
litigants
,
''
said
K.
,
``
have
all
been
right
,
just
as
I
am
.
That
does
not
*NL*
show
that
I
'm
not
.
''
``
I
was
n't
trying
to
show
that
you
were
mistaken
,
''
*NL*
said
the
lawyer
,
``
but
I
wanted
to
add
that
I
expected
better
judgement
*NL*
from
you
than
from
the
others
,
especially
as
I
've
given
you
more
insight
*NL*
into
the
workings
of
the
court
and
my
own
activities
than
I
normally
do
.
*NL*
And
now
I
'm
forced
to
accept
that
,
despite
everything
,
you
have
too
*NL*
little
trust
in
me
.
You
do
n't
make
it
easy
for
me
.
''
How
the
lawyer
was
*NL*
humiliating
himself
to
K.
!
He
was
showing
no
regard
for
the
dignity
of
*NL*
his
position
,
which
on
this
point
,
must
have
been
at
its
most
sensitive
.
*NL*
And
why
did
he
do
that
?
He
did
seem
to
be
very
busy
as
a
lawyer
as
well
*NL*
a
rich
man
,
neither
the
loss
of
income
nor
the
loss
of
a
client
could
*NL*
have
been
of
much
importance
to
him
in
themselves
.
He
was
moreover
*NL*
unwell
and
should
have
been
thinking
of
passing
work
on
to
others
.
And
*NL*
despite
all
that
he
held
on
tightly
to
K.
Why
?
Was
it
something
*NL*
personal
for
his
uncle
's
sake
,
or
did
he
really
see
K.
's
case
as
one
*NL*
that
was
exceptional
and
hoped
to
be
able
to
distinguish
himself
with
*NL*
it
,
either
for
K.
's
sake
or
-
and
this
possibility
could
never
be
*NL*
excluded
-
for
his
friends
at
the
court
?
It
was
not
possible
to
learn
*NL*
anything
by
looking
at
him
,
even
though
K.
was
scrutinizing
him
quite
*NL*
brazenly
.
It
could
almost
be
supposed
he
was
deliberately
hiding
his
*NL*
thoughts
as
he
waited
to
see
what
effect
his
words
would
have
.
But
he
*NL*
clearly
deemed
K.
's
silence
to
be
favourable
for
himself
and
he
*NL*
continued
,
``
You
will
have
noticed
the
size
of
my
office
,
but
that
I
*NL*
do
n't
employ
any
staff
to
help
me
.
That
used
to
be
quite
different
,
*NL*
there
was
a
time
when
several
young
lawyers
were
working
for
me
but
now
*NL*
I
work
alone
.
This
is
partly
to
do
with
changes
in
the
way
I
do
*NL*
business
,
in
that
I
concentrate
nowadays
more
and
more
on
matters
such
*NL*
as
your
own
case
,
and
partly
to
do
with
the
ever
deeper
understanding
*NL*
that
I
acquire
from
these
legal
matters
.
I
found
that
I
could
never
let
*NL*
anyone
else
deal
with
this
sort
of
work
unless
I
wanted
to
harm
both
the
*NL*
client
and
the
job
I
had
taken
on
.
But
the
decision
to
do
all
the
work
*NL*
myself
had
its
obvious
result
:
I
was
forced
to
turn
almost
everyone
away
*NL*
who
asked
me
to
represent
them
and
could
only
accept
those
I
was
*NL*
especially
interested
in
-
well
there
are
enough
creatures
who
leap
at
*NL*
every
crumb
I
throw
down
,
and
they
're
not
so
very
far
away
.
Most
*NL*
importantly
,
I
became
ill
from
over-work
.
But
despite
that
I
do
n't
*NL*
regret
my
decision
,
quite
possibly
I
should
have
turned
more
cases
away
*NL*
than
I
did
,
but
it
did
turn
out
to
be
entirely
necessary
for
me
to
*NL*
devote
myself
fully
to
the
cases
I
did
take
on
,
and
the
successful
*NL*
results
showed
that
it
was
worth
it
.
I
once
read
a
description
of
the
*NL*
difference
between
representing
someone
in
ordinary
legal
matters
and
in
*NL*
legal
matters
of
this
sort
,
and
the
writer
expressed
it
very
well
.
This
*NL*
is
what
he
said
:
some
lawyers
lead
their
clients
on
a
thread
until
*NL*
judgement
is
passed
,
but
there
are
others
who
immediately
lift
their
*NL*
clients
onto
their
shoulders
and
carry
them
all
the
way
to
the
judgement
*NL*
and
beyond
.
That
's
just
how
it
is
.
But
it
was
quite
true
when
I
said
I
*NL*
never
regret
all
this
work
.
But
if
,
as
in
your
case
,
they
are
so
fully
*NL*
misunderstood
,
well
,
then
I
come
very
close
to
regretting
it
.
''
All
this
*NL*
talking
did
more
to
make
K.
impatient
than
to
persuade
him
.
From
the
*NL*
way
the
lawyer
was
speaking
,
K.
thought
he
could
hear
what
he
could
*NL*
expect
if
he
gave
in
,
the
delays
and
excuses
would
begin
again
,
reports
*NL*
of
how
the
documents
were
progressing
,
how
the
mood
of
the
court
*NL*
officials
had
improved
,
as
well
as
all
the
enormous
difficulties
-
in
*NL*
short
all
that
he
had
heard
so
many
times
before
would
be
brought
out
*NL*
again
even
more
fully
,
he
would
try
to
mislead
K.
with
hopes
that
were
*NL*
never
specified
and
to
make
him
suffer
with
threats
that
were
never
*NL*
clear
.
He
had
to
put
a
stop
to
that
,
so
he
said
,
``
What
will
you
*NL*
undertake
on
my
behalf
if
you
continue
to
represent
me
?
''
The
lawyer
*NL*
quietly
accepted
even
this
insulting
question
,
and
answered
,
``
I
should
*NL*
continue
with
what
I
've
already
been
doing
for
you
.
''
``
That
's
just
what
*NL*
I
thought
,
''
said
K.
,
``
and
now
you
do
n't
need
to
say
another
word
.
''
``
I
*NL*
will
make
one
more
attempt
,
''
said
the
lawyer
as
if
whatever
had
been
*NL*
making
K.
so
annoyed
was
affecting
him
too
.
``
You
see
,
I
have
the
*NL*
impression
that
you
have
not
only
misjudged
the
legal
assistance
I
have
*NL*
given
you
but
also
that
that
misjudgement
has
led
you
to
behave
in
this
*NL*
way
,
you
seem
,
although
you
are
the
accused
,
to
have
been
treated
too
*NL*
well
or
,
to
put
it
a
better
way
,
handled
with
neglect
,
with
apparent
*NL*
neglect
.
Even
that
has
its
reason
;
it
is
often
better
to
be
in
chains
*NL*
than
to
be
free
.
But
I
would
like
to
show
you
how
other
defendants
are
*NL*
treated
,
perhaps
you
will
succeed
in
learning
something
from
it
.
What
I
*NL*
will
do
is
I
will
call
Block
in
,
unlock
the
door
and
sit
down
here
*NL*
beside
the
bedside
table
.
''
``
Be
glad
to
,
''
said
K.
,
and
did
as
the
lawyer
*NL*
suggested
;
he
was
always
ready
to
learn
something
new
.
But
to
make
sure
*NL*
of
himself
for
any
event
he
added
,
``
but
you
do
realise
that
you
are
no
*NL*
longer
to
be
my
lawyer
,
do
n't
you
?
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
``
But
you
*NL*
can
still
change
your
mind
today
if
you
want
to
.
''
He
lay
back
down
in
*NL*
the
bed
,
pulled
the
quilt
up
to
his
chin
and
turned
to
face
the
wall
.
*NL*
Then
he
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leni
appeared
almost
the
moment
he
had
done
so
.
She
looked
*NL*
hurriedly
at
K.
and
the
lawyer
to
try
and
find
out
what
had
happened
;
*NL*
she
seemed
to
be
reassured
by
the
sight
of
K.
sitting
calmly
at
the
*NL*
lawyer
's
bed
.
She
smiled
and
nodded
to
K.
,
K.
looked
blankly
back
at
*NL*
her
.
``
Fetch
Block
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
But
instead
of
going
to
fetch
*NL*
him
,
Leni
just
went
to
the
door
and
called
out
,
``
Block
!
To
the
lawyer
!
''
*NL*
Then
,
probably
because
the
lawyer
had
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
and
*NL*
was
paying
no
attention
,
she
slipped
in
behind
K.
's
chair
.
From
then
*NL*
on
,
she
bothered
him
by
leaning
forward
over
the
back
of
the
chair
or
,
*NL*
albeit
very
tenderly
and
carefully
,
she
would
run
her
hands
through
his
*NL*
hair
and
over
his
cheeks
.
K.
eventually
tried
to
stop
her
by
taking
*NL*
hold
of
one
hand
,
and
after
some
resistance
Leni
let
him
keep
hold
of
*NL*
it
.
Block
came
as
soon
as
he
was
called
,
but
he
remained
standing
in
*NL*
the
doorway
and
seemed
to
be
wondering
whether
he
should
enter
or
not
.
*NL*
He
raised
his
eyebrows
and
lowered
his
head
as
if
listening
to
find
out
*NL*
whether
the
order
to
attend
the
lawyer
would
be
repeated
.
K.
could
have
*NL*
encouraged
to
enter
,
but
he
had
decided
to
make
a
final
break
not
only
*NL*
with
the
lawyer
but
with
everything
in
his
home
,
so
he
kept
himself
*NL*
motionless
.
Leni
was
also
silent
.
Block
noticed
that
at
least
no-one
*NL*
was
chasing
him
away
,
and
,
on
tiptoe
,
he
entered
the
room
,
his
face
was
*NL*
tense
,
his
hands
were
clenched
behind
his
back
.
He
left
the
door
open
*NL*
in
case
he
needed
to
go
back
again
.
K.
did
not
even
glance
at
him
,
he
*NL*
looked
instead
only
at
the
thick
quilt
under
which
the
lawyer
could
not
*NL*
be
seen
as
he
had
squeezed
up
very
close
to
the
wall
.
Then
his
voice
*NL*
was
heard
:
``
Block
here
?
''
he
asked
.
Block
had
already
crept
some
way
*NL*
into
the
room
but
this
question
seemed
to
give
him
first
a
shove
in
the
*NL*
breast
and
then
another
in
the
back
,
he
seemed
about
to
fall
but
*NL*
remained
standing
,
deeply
bowed
,
and
said
,
``
At
your
service
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
asked
the
lawyer
,
``
you
've
come
at
a
bad
time
.
''
*NL*
``
Was
n't
I
summoned
?
''
asked
Block
,
more
to
himself
than
the
lawyer
.
He
*NL*
held
his
hands
in
front
of
himself
as
protection
and
would
have
been
*NL*
ready
to
run
away
any
moment
.
``
You
were
summoned
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
*NL*
``
but
you
have
still
come
at
a
bad
time
.
''
Then
,
after
a
pause
he
added
,
*NL*
``
You
always
come
at
a
bad
time
.
''
When
the
lawyer
started
speaking
Block
*NL*
had
stopped
looking
at
the
bed
but
stared
rather
into
one
of
the
*NL*
corners
,
just
listening
,
as
if
the
light
from
the
speaker
were
brighter
*NL*
than
Block
could
bear
to
look
at
.
But
it
was
also
difficult
for
him
to
*NL*
listen
,
as
the
lawyer
was
speaking
into
the
wall
and
speaking
quickly
*NL*
and
quietly
.
``
Would
you
like
me
to
go
away
again
,
sir
?
''
asked
Block
.
*NL*
``
Well
you
're
here
now
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
``
Stay
!
''
It
was
as
if
the
*NL*
lawyer
had
not
done
as
Block
had
wanted
but
instead
threatened
him
with
*NL*
a
stick
,
as
now
Block
really
began
to
shake
.
``
I
went
to
see
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lawyer
,
``
the
third
judge
yesterday
,
a
friend
of
mine
,
and
slowly
brought
*NL*
the
conversation
round
to
the
subject
of
you
.
Do
you
want
to
know
what
*NL*
he
said
?
''
``
Oh
,
yes
please
,
''
said
Block
.
The
lawyer
did
not
answer
*NL*
immediately
,
so
Block
repeated
his
request
and
lowered
his
head
as
if
*NL*
about
to
kneel
down
.
But
then
K.
spoke
to
him
:
``
What
do
you
think
*NL*
you
're
doing
?
''
he
shouted
.
Leni
had
wanted
to
stop
him
from
calling
out
*NL*
and
so
he
took
hold
of
her
other
hand
.
It
was
not
love
that
made
him
*NL*
squeeze
it
and
hold
on
to
it
so
tightly
,
she
sighed
frequently
and
tried
*NL*
to
disengage
her
hands
from
him
.
But
Block
was
punished
for
K.
's
*NL*
outburst
,
as
the
lawyer
asked
him
,
``
Who
is
your
lawyer
?
''
``
You
are
,
*NL*
sir
,
''
said
Block
.
``
And
who
besides
me
?
''
the
lawyer
asked
.
``
No-one
*NL*
besides
you
,
sir
,
''
said
Block
.
``
And
let
there
be
no-one
besides
me
,
''
*NL*
said
the
lawyer
.
Block
fully
understood
what
that
meant
,
he
glowered
at
*NL*
K.
,
shaking
his
head
violently
.
If
these
actions
had
been
translated
*NL*
into
words
they
would
have
been
coarse
insults
.
K.
had
been
friendly
*NL*
and
willing
to
discuss
his
own
case
with
someone
like
this
!
``
I
wo
n't
*NL*
disturb
you
any
more
,
''
said
K.
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
.
``
You
can
*NL*
kneel
down
or
creep
on
all
fours
,
whatever
you
like
.
I
wo
n't
bother
*NL*
with
you
any
more
.
''
But
Block
still
had
some
sense
of
pride
,
at
least
*NL*
where
K.
was
concerned
,
and
he
went
towards
him
waving
his
fists
,
*NL*
shouting
as
loudly
as
he
dared
while
the
lawyer
was
there
.
``
You
*NL*
should
n't
speak
to
me
like
that
,
that
's
not
allowed
.
Why
are
you
*NL*
insulting
me
?
Especially
here
in
front
of
the
lawyer
,
where
both
of
us
,
*NL*
you
and
me
,
we
're
only
tolerated
because
of
his
charity
.
You
're
not
a
*NL*
better
person
than
me
,
you
've
been
accused
of
something
too
,
you
're
*NL*
facing
a
charge
too
.
If
,
in
spite
of
that
,
you
're
still
a
gentleman
*NL*
then
I
'm
just
as
much
a
gentleman
as
you
are
,
if
not
even
more
so
.
And
*NL*
I
want
to
be
spoken
to
as
a
gentleman
,
especially
by
you
.
If
you
think
*NL*
being
allowed
to
sit
there
and
quietly
listen
while
I
creep
on
all
fours
*NL*
as
you
put
it
makes
you
something
better
than
me
,
then
there
's
an
old
*NL*
legal
saying
you
ought
to
bear
in
mind
:
If
you
're
under
suspicion
it
's
*NL*
better
to
be
moving
than
still
,
as
if
you
're
still
you
can
be
in
the
pan
*NL*
of
the
scales
without
knowing
it
and
be
weighed
along
with
your
sins
.
''
*NL*
K.
said
nothing
.
He
merely
looked
in
amazement
at
this
distracted
*NL*
being
,
his
eyes
completely
still
.
He
had
gone
through
such
changes
in
*NL*
just
the
last
few
hours
!
Was
it
the
trial
that
was
throwing
him
from
*NL*
side
to
side
in
this
way
and
stopped
him
knowing
who
was
friend
and
who
*NL*
was
foe
?
Could
he
not
see
the
lawyer
was
deliberately
humiliating
him
*NL*
and
had
no
other
purpose
today
than
to
show
off
his
power
to
K.
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
even
thereby
subjugate
K.
?
But
if
Block
was
incapable
of
seeing
*NL*
that
,
or
if
he
so
feared
the
lawyer
that
no
such
insight
would
even
be
*NL*
of
any
use
to
him
,
how
was
it
that
he
was
either
so
sly
or
so
bold
as
to
*NL*
lie
to
the
lawyer
and
conceal
from
him
the
fact
that
he
had
other
*NL*
lawyers
working
on
his
behalf
?
And
how
did
he
dare
to
attack
K.
,
who
*NL*
could
betray
his
secret
any
time
he
liked
?
But
he
dared
even
more
than
*NL*
this
,
he
went
to
the
lawyer
's
bed
and
began
there
to
make
complaints
*NL*
about
K.
``
Dr.
Huld
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
did
you
hear
the
way
this
man
spoke
*NL*
to
me
?
You
can
count
the
length
of
his
trial
in
hours
,
and
he
wants
to
*NL*
tell
me
what
to
do
when
I
've
been
involved
in
a
legal
case
for
five
*NL*
years
.
He
even
insults
me
.
He
does
n't
know
anything
,
but
he
insults
*NL*
me
,
when
I
,
as
far
as
my
weak
ability
allows
,
when
I
've
made
a
close
*NL*
study
of
how
to
behave
with
the
court
,
what
we
ought
to
do
and
what
the
*NL*
court
practices
are
.
''
``
Do
n't
let
anyone
bother
you
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
*NL*
``
and
do
what
seems
to
you
to
be
right
.
''
``
I
will
,
''
said
Block
,
as
if
*NL*
speaking
to
himself
to
give
himself
courage
,
and
with
a
quick
glance
to
*NL*
the
side
he
kneeled
down
close
beside
the
bed
.
``
I
'm
kneeling
now
Dr.
*NL*
Huld
,
sir
,
''
he
said
.
But
the
lawyer
remained
silent
.
With
one
hand
,
*NL*
Block
carefully
stroked
the
bed
cover
.
In
the
silence
while
he
did
so
,
*NL*
Leni
,
as
she
freed
herself
from
K.
's
hands
,
said
,
``
You
're
hurting
me
.
*NL*
Let
go
of
me
.
I
'm
going
over
to
Block
.
''
She
went
over
to
him
and
sat
*NL*
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
.
Block
was
very
pleased
at
this
and
with
lively
,
*NL*
but
silent
,
gestures
he
immediately
urged
her
to
intercede
for
him
with
*NL*
the
lawyer
.
It
was
clear
that
he
desperately
needed
to
be
told
*NL*
something
by
the
lawyer
,
although
perhaps
only
so
that
he
could
make
use
*NL*
of
the
information
with
his
other
lawyers
.
Leni
probably
knew
very
well
*NL*
how
the
lawyer
could
be
brought
round
,
pointed
to
his
hand
and
pursed
*NL*
her
lips
as
if
making
a
kiss
.
Block
immediately
performed
the
hand-kiss
*NL*
and
,
at
further
urging
from
Leni
,
repeated
it
twice
more
.
But
the
*NL*
lawyer
continued
to
be
silent
.
Then
Leni
leant
over
the
lawyer
,
as
she
*NL*
stretched
out
,
the
attractive
shape
of
her
body
could
be
seen
,
and
,
bent
*NL*
over
close
to
his
face
,
she
stroked
his
long
white
hair
.
That
now
*NL*
forced
him
to
give
an
answer
.
``
I
'm
rather
wary
of
telling
him
,
''
said
*NL*
the
lawyer
,
and
his
head
could
be
seen
shaking
slightly
,
perhaps
so
that
*NL*
he
would
feel
the
pressure
of
Leni
's
hand
better
.
Block
listened
*NL*
closely
with
his
head
lowered
,
as
if
by
listening
he
were
breaking
an
*NL*
order
.
``
What
makes
you
so
wary
about
it
?
''
asked
Leni
.
K.
had
the
*NL*
feeling
he
was
listening
to
a
contrived
dialogue
that
had
been
repeated
*NL*
many
times
,
that
would
be
repeated
many
times
more
,
and
that
for
Block
*NL*
alone
it
would
never
lose
its
freshness
.
``
What
has
his
behaviour
been
*NL*
like
today
?
''
asked
the
lawyer
instead
of
an
answer
.
Before
Leni
said
*NL*
anything
she
looked
down
at
Block
and
watched
him
a
short
while
as
he
*NL*
raised
his
hands
towards
her
and
rubbed
them
together
imploringly
.
*NL*
Finally
she
gave
a
serious
nod
,
turned
back
to
the
lawyer
and
said
,
*NL*
``
He
's
been
quiet
and
industrious
.
''
This
was
an
elderly
businessman
,
a
*NL*
man
whose
beard
was
long
,
and
he
was
begging
a
young
girl
to
speak
on
*NL*
his
behalf
.
Even
if
there
was
some
plan
behind
what
he
did
,
there
was
*NL*
nothing
that
could
reinstate
him
in
the
eyes
of
his
fellow
man
.
K.
*NL*
could
not
understand
how
the
lawyer
could
have
thought
this
performance
*NL*
would
win
him
over
.
Even
if
he
had
done
nothing
earlier
to
make
him
*NL*
want
to
leave
then
this
scene
would
have
done
so
.
It
was
almost
*NL*
humiliating
even
for
the
onlooker
.
So
these
were
the
lawyer
's
methods
,
*NL*
which
K.
fortunately
had
not
been
exposed
to
for
long
,
to
let
the
client
*NL*
forget
about
the
whole
world
and
leave
him
with
nothing
but
the
hope
of
*NL*
reaching
the
end
of
his
trial
by
this
deluded
means
.
He
was
no
longer
a
*NL*
client
,
he
was
the
lawyer
's
dog
.
If
the
lawyer
had
ordered
him
to
crawl
*NL*
under
the
bed
as
if
it
were
a
kennel
and
to
bark
out
from
under
it
,
then
*NL*
he
would
have
done
so
with
enthusiasm
.
K.
listened
to
all
of
this
,
*NL*
testing
it
and
thinking
it
over
as
if
he
had
been
given
the
task
of
*NL*
closely
observing
everything
spoken
here
,
inform
a
higher
office
about
*NL*
it
and
write
a
report
.
``
And
what
has
he
been
doing
all
day
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
lawyer
.
``
I
kept
him
locked
in
the
maid
's
room
all
day
,
''
said
Leni
,
``
so
*NL*
that
he
would
n't
stop
me
doing
my
work
.
That
's
where
he
usually
stays
.
*NL*
From
time
to
time
I
looked
in
through
the
spyhole
to
see
what
he
was
*NL*
doing
,
and
each
time
he
was
kneeling
on
the
bed
and
reading
the
papers
*NL*
you
gave
him
,
propped
up
on
the
window
sill
.
That
made
a
good
*NL*
impression
on
me
;
as
the
window
only
opens
onto
an
air
shaft
and
gives
*NL*
hardly
any
light
.
It
showed
how
obedient
he
is
that
he
was
even
reading
*NL*
in
those
conditions
.
''
``
I
'm
pleased
to
hear
it
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
``
But
*NL*
did
he
understand
what
he
was
reading
?
''
While
this
conversation
was
*NL*
going
on
,
Block
continually
moved
his
lips
and
was
clearly
formulating
*NL*
the
answers
he
hoped
Leni
would
give
.
``
Well
I
ca
n't
give
you
any
*NL*
certain
answer
to
that
of
course
,
''
said
Leni
,
``
but
I
could
see
that
he
*NL*
was
reading
thoroughly
.
He
spent
all
day
reading
the
same
page
,
running
*NL*
his
finger
along
the
lines
.
Whenever
I
looked
in
on
him
he
sighed
as
if
*NL*
this
reading
was
a
lot
of
work
for
him
.
I
expect
the
papers
you
gave
*NL*
him
were
very
hard
to
understand
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
lawyer
,
``
they
*NL*
certainly
are
that
.
And
I
really
do
n't
think
he
understood
anything
of
*NL*
them
.
But
they
should
at
least
give
him
some
inkling
of
just
how
hard
a
*NL*
struggle
it
is
and
how
much
work
it
is
for
me
to
defend
him
.
And
who
am
*NL*
I
doing
all
this
hard
work
for
?
I
'm
doing
it
-
it
's
laughable
even
to
*NL*
say
it
-
I
'm
doing
it
for
Block
.
He
ought
to
realise
what
that
means
,
*NL*
too
.
Did
he
study
without
a
pause
?
''
``
Almost
without
a
pause
,
''
answered
*NL*
Leni
.
``
Just
the
once
he
asked
me
for
a
drink
of
water
,
so
I
gave
him
a
*NL*
glassful
through
the
window
.
Then
at
eight
o'clock
I
let
him
out
and
*NL*
gave
him
something
to
eat
.
''
Block
glanced
sideways
at
K.
,
as
if
he
were
*NL*
being
praised
and
had
to
impress
K.
as
well
.
He
now
seemed
more
*NL*
optimistic
,
he
moved
more
freely
and
rocked
back
and
forth
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
This
made
his
astonishment
all
the
more
obvious
when
he
heard
the
*NL*
following
words
from
the
lawyer
:
``
You
speak
well
of
him
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lawyer
,
``
but
that
's
just
what
makes
it
difficult
for
me
.
You
see
,
the
*NL*
judge
did
not
speak
well
of
him
at
all
,
neither
about
Block
nor
about
*NL*
his
case
.
''
``
Did
n't
speak
well
of
him
?
''
asked
Leni
.
``
How
is
that
*NL*
possible
?
''
Block
looked
at
her
with
such
tension
he
seemed
to
think
*NL*
that
although
the
judge
's
words
had
been
spoken
so
long
before
she
would
*NL*
be
able
to
change
them
in
his
favour
.
``
Not
at
all
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
``
In
fact
he
became
quite
cross
when
I
started
to
talk
about
Block
to
*NL*
him
.
`
Do
n't
talk
to
me
about
Block
,
'
he
said
.
`
He
is
my
client
,
'
said
*NL*
I.
`
You
're
letting
him
abuse
you
,
'
he
said
.
'
I
do
n't
think
his
case
is
*NL*
lost
yet
,
'
said
I.
`
You
're
letting
him
abuse
you
,
'
he
repeated
.
'
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
so
,
'
said
I.
`
Block
works
hard
in
his
case
and
always
knows
*NL*
where
it
stands
.
He
practically
lives
with
me
so
that
he
always
knows
*NL*
what
's
happening
.
You
do
n't
always
find
such
enthusiasm
as
that
.
He
's
*NL*
not
very
pleasant
personally
,
I
grant
you
,
his
manners
are
terrible
and
*NL*
he
's
dirty
,
but
as
far
as
the
trial
's
concerned
he
's
quite
immaculate
.
'
*NL*
I
said
immaculate
,
but
I
was
deliberately
exaggerating
.
Then
he
said
,
*NL*
`
Block
is
sly
,
that
's
all
.
He
's
accumulated
plenty
of
experience
and
*NL*
knows
how
to
delay
proceedings
.
But
there
's
more
that
he
does
n't
know
*NL*
than
he
does
.
What
do
you
think
he
'd
say
if
he
learned
his
trial
still
*NL*
has
n't
begun
,
if
you
told
him
they
have
n't
even
rung
the
bell
to
*NL*
announce
the
start
of
proceedings
?
'
Alright
Block
,
alright
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lawyer
,
as
at
these
words
Block
had
begun
to
raise
himself
on
his
*NL*
trembling
knees
and
clearly
wanted
to
plead
for
some
explanation
.
It
*NL*
was
the
first
time
the
lawyer
had
spoken
any
clear
words
directly
to
*NL*
Block
.
He
looked
down
with
his
tired
eyes
,
half
blankly
and
half
at
*NL*
Block
,
who
slowly
sank
back
down
on
his
knees
under
this
gaze
.
``
What
*NL*
the
judge
said
has
no
meaning
for
you
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
``
You
need
n't
*NL*
be
frightened
at
every
word
.
If
you
do
it
again
I
wo
n't
tell
you
*NL*
anything
else
at
all
.
It
's
impossible
to
start
a
sentence
without
you
*NL*
looking
at
me
as
if
you
were
receiving
your
final
judgement
.
You
should
*NL*
be
ashamed
of
yourself
here
in
front
of
my
client
!
And
you
're
*NL*
destroying
the
trust
he
has
for
me
.
Just
what
is
it
you
want
?
You
're
*NL*
still
alive
,
you
're
still
under
my
protection
.
There
's
no
point
in
*NL*
worrying
!
Somewhere
you
've
read
that
the
final
judgement
can
often
come
*NL*
without
warning
,
from
anyone
at
any
time
.
And
,
in
the
right
*NL*
circumstances
,
that
's
basically
true
,
but
it
's
also
true
that
I
dislike
*NL*
your
anxiety
and
fear
and
see
that
you
do
n't
have
the
trust
in
me
you
*NL*
should
have
.
Now
what
have
I
just
said
?
I
repeated
something
said
by
*NL*
one
of
the
judges
.
You
know
that
there
are
so
many
various
opinions
*NL*
about
the
procedure
that
they
form
into
a
great
big
pile
and
nobody
can
*NL*
make
any
sense
of
them
.
This
judge
,
for
instance
,
sees
proceedings
as
*NL*
starting
at
a
different
point
from
where
I
do
.
A
difference
of
opinion
,
*NL*
nothing
more
.
At
a
certain
stage
in
the
proceedings
tradition
has
it
*NL*
that
a
sign
is
given
by
ringing
a
bell
.
This
judge
sees
that
as
the
*NL*
point
at
which
proceedings
begin
.
I
ca
n't
set
out
all
the
opinions
*NL*
opposed
to
that
view
here
,
and
you
would
n't
understand
it
anyway
,
*NL*
suffice
it
to
say
that
there
are
many
reasons
to
disagree
with
him
.
''
*NL*
Embarrassed
,
Block
ran
his
fingers
through
the
pile
of
the
carpet
,
his
*NL*
anxiety
about
what
the
judge
had
said
had
let
him
forget
his
inferior
*NL*
status
towards
the
lawyer
for
a
while
,
he
thought
only
about
himself
and
*NL*
turned
the
judges
words
round
to
examine
them
from
all
sides
.
``
Block
,
''
*NL*
said
Leni
,
as
if
reprimanding
him
,
and
,
taking
hold
of
the
collar
of
his
*NL*
coat
,
pulled
him
up
slightly
higher
.
``
Leave
the
carpet
alone
and
listen
*NL*
to
what
the
lawyer
is
saying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
chapter
was
left
unfinished
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
Nine
*NL*
In
the
Cathedral
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
important
Italian
business
contact
of
the
bank
had
come
to
*NL*
visit
the
city
for
the
first
time
and
K.
was
given
the
task
of
showing
*NL*
him
some
of
its
cultural
sights
.
At
any
other
time
he
would
have
seen
*NL*
this
job
as
an
honour
but
now
,
when
he
was
finding
it
hard
even
to
*NL*
maintain
his
current
position
in
the
bank
,
he
accepted
it
only
with
*NL*
reluctance
.
Every
hour
that
he
could
not
be
in
the
office
was
a
cause
*NL*
of
concern
for
him
,
he
was
no
longer
able
to
make
use
of
his
time
in
the
*NL*
office
anything
like
as
well
as
he
had
previously
,
he
spent
many
hours
*NL*
merely
pretending
to
do
important
work
,
but
that
only
increased
his
*NL*
anxiety
about
not
being
in
the
office
.
Then
he
sometimes
thought
he
saw
*NL*
the
deputy
director
,
who
was
always
watching
,
come
into
K.
's
office
,
sit
*NL*
at
his
desk
,
look
through
his
papers
,
receive
clients
who
had
almost
*NL*
become
old
friends
of
K.
,
and
lure
them
away
from
him
,
perhaps
he
even
*NL*
discovered
mistakes
,
mistakes
that
seemed
to
threaten
K.
from
a
thousand
*NL*
directions
when
he
was
at
work
now
,
and
which
he
could
no
longer
avoid
.
*NL*
So
now
,
if
he
was
ever
asked
to
leave
the
office
on
business
or
even
*NL*
needed
to
make
a
short
business
trip
,
however
much
an
honour
it
seemed
-
*NL*
and
tasks
of
this
sort
happened
to
have
increased
substantially
recently
*NL*
-
there
was
always
the
suspicion
that
they
wanted
to
get
him
out
of
his
*NL*
office
for
a
while
and
check
his
work
,
or
at
least
the
idea
that
they
*NL*
thought
he
was
dispensable
.
It
would
not
have
been
difficult
for
him
to
*NL*
turn
down
most
of
these
jobs
,
but
he
did
not
dare
to
do
so
because
,
if
*NL*
his
fears
had
the
slightest
foundation
,
turning
the
jobs
down
would
have
*NL*
been
an
acknowledgement
of
them
.
For
this
reason
,
he
never
demurred
*NL*
from
accepting
them
,
and
even
when
he
was
asked
to
go
on
a
tiring
*NL*
business
trip
lasting
two
days
he
said
nothing
about
having
to
go
out
in
*NL*
the
rainy
autumn
weather
when
he
had
a
severe
chill
,
just
in
order
to
*NL*
avoid
the
risk
of
not
being
asked
to
go
.
When
,
with
a
raging
headache
,
*NL*
he
arrived
back
from
this
trip
he
learned
that
he
had
been
chosen
to
*NL*
accompany
the
Italian
business
contact
the
following
day
.
The
*NL*
temptation
for
once
to
turn
the
job
down
was
very
great
,
especially
as
*NL*
it
had
no
direct
connection
with
business
,
but
there
was
no
denying
that
*NL*
social
obligations
towards
this
business
contact
were
in
themselves
*NL*
important
enough
,
only
not
for
K.
,
who
knew
quite
well
that
he
needed
*NL*
some
successes
at
work
if
he
was
to
maintain
his
position
there
and
*NL*
that
,
if
he
failed
in
that
,
it
would
not
help
him
even
if
this
Italian
*NL*
somehow
found
him
quite
charming
;
he
did
not
want
to
be
removed
from
his
*NL*
workplace
for
even
one
day
,
as
the
fear
of
not
being
allowed
back
in
was
*NL*
too
great
,
he
knew
full
well
that
the
fear
was
exaggerated
but
it
still
*NL*
made
him
anxious
.
However
,
in
this
case
it
was
almost
impossible
to
*NL*
think
of
an
acceptable
excuse
,
his
knowledge
of
Italian
was
not
great
*NL*
but
still
good
enough
;
the
deciding
factor
was
that
K.
had
earlier
known
*NL*
a
little
about
art
history
and
this
had
become
widely
known
around
the
*NL*
bank
in
extremely
exaggerated
form
,
and
that
K.
had
been
a
member
of
the
*NL*
Society
for
the
Preservation
of
City
Monuments
,
albeit
only
for
business
*NL*
reasons
.
It
was
said
that
this
Italian
was
an
art
lover
,
so
the
choice
*NL*
of
K.
to
accompany
him
was
a
matter
of
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
rainy
and
stormy
morning
when
K.
,
in
a
foul
temper
*NL*
at
the
thought
of
the
day
ahead
of
him
,
arrived
early
at
seven
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
office
so
that
he
could
at
least
do
some
work
before
his
visitor
*NL*
would
prevent
him
.
He
had
spent
half
the
night
studying
a
book
of
*NL*
Italian
grammar
so
that
he
would
be
somewhat
prepared
and
was
very
*NL*
tired
;
his
desk
was
less
attractive
to
him
than
the
window
where
he
had
*NL*
spent
far
too
much
time
sitting
of
late
,
but
he
resisted
the
temptation
*NL*
and
sat
down
to
his
work
.
Unfortunately
,
just
then
the
servitor
came
in
*NL*
and
reported
that
the
director
had
sent
him
to
see
whether
the
chief
*NL*
clerk
was
already
in
his
office
;
if
he
was
,
then
would
he
please
be
so
*NL*
kind
as
to
come
to
his
reception
room
as
the
gentleman
from
Italy
was
*NL*
already
there
.
``
I
'll
come
straight
away
,
''
said
K
.
He
put
a
small
*NL*
dictionary
in
his
pocket
,
took
a
guide
to
the
city
's
tourist
sites
under
*NL*
his
arm
that
he
had
compiled
for
strangers
,
and
went
through
the
deputy
*NL*
director
's
office
into
that
of
the
director
.
He
was
glad
he
had
come
*NL*
into
the
office
so
early
and
was
able
to
be
of
service
immediately
,
*NL*
nobody
could
seriously
have
expected
that
of
him
.
The
deputy
director
's
*NL*
office
was
,
of
course
,
still
as
empty
as
the
middle
of
the
night
,
the
*NL*
servitor
had
probably
been
asked
to
summon
him
too
but
without
success
.
*NL*
As
K.
entered
the
reception
room
two
men
stood
up
from
the
deep
*NL*
armchairs
where
they
had
been
sitting
.
The
director
gave
him
a
friendly
*NL*
smile
,
he
was
clearly
very
glad
that
K.
was
there
,
he
immediately
*NL*
introduced
him
to
the
Italian
who
shook
K.
's
hand
vigorously
and
joked
*NL*
that
somebody
was
an
early
riser
.
K.
did
not
quite
understand
whom
he
*NL*
had
in
mind
,
it
was
moreover
an
odd
expression
to
use
and
it
took
K.
a
*NL*
little
while
to
guess
its
meaning
.
He
replied
with
a
few
bland
phrases
*NL*
which
the
Italian
received
once
more
with
a
laugh
,
passing
his
hand
*NL*
nervously
and
repeatedly
over
his
blue-grey
,
bushy
moustache
.
This
*NL*
moustache
was
obviously
perfumed
,
it
was
almost
tempting
to
come
close
*NL*
to
it
and
sniff
.
When
they
had
all
sat
down
and
begun
a
light
*NL*
preliminary
conversation
,
K.
was
disconcerted
to
notice
that
he
*NL*
understood
no
more
than
fragments
of
what
the
Italian
said
.
When
he
*NL*
spoke
very
calmly
he
understood
almost
everything
,
but
that
was
very
*NL*
infrequent
,
mostly
the
words
gushed
from
his
mouth
and
he
seemed
to
be
*NL*
enjoying
himself
so
much
his
head
shook
.
When
he
was
talking
in
this
*NL*
way
his
speech
was
usually
wrapped
up
in
some
kind
of
dialect
which
*NL*
seemed
to
K.
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
Italian
but
which
the
director
*NL*
not
only
understood
but
also
spoke
,
although
K.
ought
to
have
foreseen
*NL*
this
as
the
Italian
came
from
the
south
of
his
country
where
the
*NL*
director
had
also
spent
several
years
.
Whatever
the
cause
,
K.
realised
*NL*
that
the
possibility
of
communicating
with
the
Italian
had
been
largely
*NL*
taken
from
him
,
even
his
French
was
difficult
to
understand
,
and
his
*NL*
moustache
concealed
the
movements
of
his
lips
which
might
have
offered
*NL*
some
help
in
understanding
what
he
said
.
K.
began
to
anticipate
many
*NL*
difficulties
,
he
gave
up
trying
to
understand
what
the
Italian
said
-
*NL*
with
the
director
there
,
who
could
understand
him
so
easily
,
it
would
*NL*
have
been
pointless
effort
-
and
for
the
time
being
did
no
more
than
*NL*
scowl
at
the
Italian
as
he
relaxed
sitting
deep
but
comfortable
in
the
*NL*
armchair
,
as
he
frequently
pulled
at
his
short
,
sharply
tailored
jacket
*NL*
and
at
one
time
lifted
his
arms
in
the
air
and
moved
his
hands
freely
to
*NL*
try
and
depict
something
that
K.
could
not
grasp
,
even
though
he
was
*NL*
leaning
forward
and
did
not
let
the
hands
out
of
his
sight
.
K.
had
*NL*
nothing
to
occupy
himself
but
mechanically
watch
the
exchange
between
*NL*
the
two
men
and
his
tiredness
finally
made
itself
felt
,
to
his
alarm
,
*NL*
although
fortunately
in
good
time
,
he
once
caught
himself
nearly
getting
*NL*
up
,
turning
round
and
leaving
.
Eventually
the
Italian
looked
at
the
*NL*
clock
and
jumped
up
.
After
taking
his
leave
from
the
director
he
turned
*NL*
to
K.
,
pressing
himself
so
close
to
him
that
K.
had
to
push
his
chair
*NL*
back
just
so
that
he
could
move
.
The
director
had
,
no
doubt
,
seen
the
*NL*
anxiety
in
K.
's
eyes
as
he
tried
to
cope
with
this
dialect
of
Italian
,
*NL*
he
joined
in
with
this
conversation
in
a
way
that
was
so
adroit
and
*NL*
unobtrusive
that
he
seemed
to
be
adding
no
more
than
minor
comments
,
*NL*
whereas
in
fact
he
was
swiftly
and
patiently
breaking
into
what
the
*NL*
Italian
said
so
that
K.
could
understand
.
K.
learned
in
this
way
that
*NL*
the
Italian
first
had
a
few
business
matters
to
settle
,
that
he
*NL*
unfortunately
had
only
a
little
time
at
his
disposal
,
that
he
certainly
*NL*
did
not
intend
to
rush
round
to
see
every
monument
in
the
city
,
that
he
*NL*
would
much
rather
-
at
least
as
long
as
K.
would
agree
,
it
was
entirely
*NL*
his
decision
-
just
see
the
cathedral
and
to
do
so
thoroughly
.
He
was
*NL*
extremely
pleased
to
be
accompanied
by
someone
who
was
so
learned
and
so
*NL*
pleasant
-
by
this
he
meant
K.
,
who
was
occupied
not
with
listening
to
*NL*
the
Italian
but
the
director
-
and
asked
if
he
would
be
so
kind
,
if
the
*NL*
time
was
suitable
,
to
meet
him
in
the
cathedral
in
two
hours
'
time
at
*NL*
about
ten
o'clock
.
He
hoped
he
would
certainly
be
able
to
be
there
at
*NL*
that
time
.
K.
made
an
appropriate
reply
,
the
Italian
shook
first
the
*NL*
director
's
hand
and
then
K.
's
,
then
the
director
's
again
and
went
to
the
*NL*
door
,
half
turned
to
the
two
men
who
followed
him
and
continuing
to
talk
*NL*
without
a
break
.
K.
remained
together
with
the
director
for
a
short
*NL*
while
,
although
the
director
looked
especially
unhappy
today
.
He
*NL*
thought
he
needed
to
apologise
to
K.
for
something
and
told
him
-
they
*NL*
were
standing
intimately
close
together
-
he
had
thought
at
first
he
*NL*
would
accompany
the
Italian
himself
,
but
then
-
he
gave
no
more
precise
*NL*
reason
than
this
-
then
he
decided
it
would
be
better
to
send
K.
with
*NL*
him
.
He
should
not
be
surprised
if
he
could
not
understand
the
Italian
*NL*
at
first
,
he
would
be
able
to
very
soon
,
and
even
if
he
really
could
not
*NL*
understand
very
much
he
said
it
was
not
so
bad
,
as
it
was
really
not
so
*NL*
important
for
the
Italian
to
be
understood
.
And
anyway
,
K.
's
knowledge
*NL*
of
Italian
was
surprisingly
good
,
the
director
was
sure
he
would
get
by
*NL*
very
well
.
And
with
that
,
it
was
time
for
K.
to
go
.
He
spent
the
time
*NL*
still
remaining
to
him
with
a
dictionary
,
copying
out
obscure
words
he
*NL*
would
need
to
guide
the
Italian
round
the
cathedral
.
It
was
an
*NL*
extremely
irksome
task
,
servitors
brought
him
the
mail
,
bank
staff
came
*NL*
with
various
queries
and
,
when
they
saw
that
K.
was
busy
,
stood
by
the
*NL*
door
and
did
not
go
away
until
he
had
listened
to
them
,
the
deputy
*NL*
director
did
not
miss
the
opportunity
to
disturb
K.
and
came
in
*NL*
frequently
,
took
the
dictionary
from
his
hand
and
flicked
through
its
*NL*
pages
,
clearly
for
no
purpose
,
when
the
door
to
the
ante-room
opened
*NL*
even
clients
would
appear
from
the
half
darkness
and
bow
timidly
to
him
*NL*
-
they
wanted
to
attract
his
attention
but
were
not
sure
whether
he
had
*NL*
seen
them
-
all
this
activity
was
circling
around
K.
with
him
at
its
*NL*
centre
while
he
compiled
the
list
of
words
he
would
need
,
then
looked
*NL*
them
up
in
the
dictionary
,
then
wrote
them
out
,
then
practised
their
*NL*
pronunciation
and
finally
tried
to
learn
them
by
heart
.
The
good
*NL*
intentions
he
had
had
earlier
,
though
,
seemed
to
have
left
him
*NL*
completely
,
it
was
the
Italian
who
had
caused
him
all
this
effort
and
*NL*
sometimes
he
became
so
angry
with
him
that
he
buried
the
dictionary
*NL*
under
some
papers
firmly
intending
to
do
no
more
preparation
,
but
then
*NL*
he
realised
he
could
not
walk
up
and
down
in
the
cathedral
with
the
*NL*
Italian
without
saying
a
word
,
so
,
in
an
even
greater
rage
,
he
*NL*
pulled
the
dictionary
back
out
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
exactly
half
past
nine
,
just
when
he
was
about
to
leave
,
there
*NL*
was
a
telephone
call
for
him
,
Leni
wished
him
good
morning
and
asked
how
*NL*
he
was
,
K.
thanked
her
hurriedly
and
told
her
it
was
impossible
for
him
*NL*
to
talk
now
as
he
had
to
go
to
the
cathedral
.
``
To
the
cathedral
?
''
asked
*NL*
Leni
.
``
Yes
,
to
the
cathedral
.
''
``
What
do
you
have
to
go
to
the
*NL*
cathedral
for
?
''
said
Leni
.
K.
tried
to
explain
it
to
her
briefly
,
but
*NL*
he
had
hardly
begun
when
Leni
suddenly
said
,
``
They
're
harassing
you
.
''
*NL*
One
thing
that
K.
could
not
bear
was
pity
that
he
had
not
wanted
or
*NL*
expected
,
he
took
his
leave
of
her
with
two
words
,
but
as
he
put
the
*NL*
receiver
back
in
its
place
he
said
,
half
to
himself
and
half
to
the
girl
*NL*
on
the
other
end
of
the
line
who
could
no
longer
hear
him
,
``
Yes
,
they
're
*NL*
harassing
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
now
the
time
was
late
and
there
was
almost
a
danger
he
would
*NL*
not
be
on
time
.
He
took
a
taxi
to
the
cathedral
,
at
the
last
moment
he
*NL*
had
remembered
the
album
that
he
had
had
no
opportunity
to
give
to
the
*NL*
Italian
earlier
and
so
took
it
with
him
now
.
He
held
it
on
his
knees
*NL*
and
drummed
impatiently
on
it
during
the
whole
journey
.
The
rain
had
*NL*
eased
off
slightly
but
it
was
still
damp
chilly
and
dark
,
it
would
be
*NL*
difficult
to
see
anything
in
the
cathedral
but
standing
about
on
cold
*NL*
flagstones
might
well
make
K.
's
chill
much
worse
.
The
square
in
front
*NL*
of
the
cathedral
was
quite
empty
,
K.
remembered
how
even
as
a
small
*NL*
child
he
had
noticed
that
nearly
all
the
houses
in
this
narrow
square
*NL*
had
the
curtains
at
their
windows
closed
most
of
the
time
,
although
*NL*
today
,
with
the
weather
like
this
,
it
was
more
understandable
.
The
*NL*
cathedral
also
seemed
quite
empty
,
of
course
no-one
would
think
of
going
*NL*
there
on
a
day
like
this
.
K.
hurried
along
both
the
side
naves
but
saw
*NL*
no-one
but
an
old
woman
who
,
wrapped
up
in
a
warm
shawl
,
was
kneeling
at
*NL*
a
picture
of
the
Virgin
Mary
and
staring
up
at
it
.
Then
,
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
he
saw
a
church
official
who
limped
away
through
a
doorway
in
*NL*
the
wall
.
K.
had
arrived
on
time
,
it
had
struck
ten
just
as
he
was
*NL*
entering
the
building
,
but
the
Italian
still
was
not
there
.
K.
went
*NL*
back
to
the
main
entrance
,
stood
there
indecisively
for
a
while
,
and
*NL*
then
walked
round
the
cathedral
in
the
rain
in
case
the
Italian
was
*NL*
waiting
at
another
entrance
.
He
was
nowhere
to
be
found
.
Could
the
*NL*
director
have
misunderstood
what
time
they
had
agreed
on
?
How
could
*NL*
anyone
understand
someone
like
that
properly
anyway
?
Whatever
had
*NL*
happened
,
K.
would
have
to
wait
for
him
for
at
least
half
an
hour
.
As
*NL*
he
was
tired
he
wanted
to
sit
down
,
he
went
back
inside
the
cathedral
,
*NL*
he
found
something
like
a
small
carpet
on
one
of
the
steps
,
he
moved
it
*NL*
with
his
foot
to
a
nearby
pew
,
wrapped
himself
up
tighter
in
his
coat
,
*NL*
put
the
collar
up
and
sat
down
.
To
pass
the
time
he
opened
the
album
*NL*
and
flicked
through
the
pages
a
little
but
soon
had
to
give
up
as
it
*NL*
became
so
dark
that
when
he
looked
up
he
could
hardly
make
out
anything
*NL*
in
the
side
nave
next
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
distance
there
was
a
large
triangle
of
candles
flickering
*NL*
on
the
main
altar
,
K.
was
not
certain
whether
he
had
seen
them
earlier
.
*NL*
Perhaps
they
had
only
just
been
lit
.
Church
staff
creep
silently
as
*NL*
part
of
their
job
,
you
do
n't
notice
them
.
When
K.
happened
to
turn
*NL*
round
he
also
saw
a
tall
,
stout
candle
attached
to
a
column
not
far
*NL*
behind
him
.
It
was
all
very
pretty
,
but
totally
inadequate
to
*NL*
illuminate
the
pictures
which
were
usually
left
in
the
darkness
of
the
*NL*
side
altars
,
and
seemed
to
make
the
darkness
all
the
deeper
.
It
was
*NL*
discourteous
of
the
Italian
not
to
come
but
it
was
also
sensible
of
him
,
*NL*
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
see
,
they
would
have
had
to
content
*NL*
themselves
with
seeking
out
a
few
pictures
with
K.
's
electric
pocket
*NL*
torch
and
looking
at
them
one
small
part
at
a
time
.
K.
went
over
to
a
*NL*
nearby
side
chapel
to
see
what
they
could
have
hoped
for
,
he
went
up
a
*NL*
few
steps
to
a
low
marble
railing
and
leant
over
it
to
look
at
the
altar
*NL*
picture
by
the
light
of
his
torch
.
The
eternal
light
hung
disturbingly
*NL*
in
front
of
it
.
The
first
thing
that
K.
partly
saw
and
partly
guessed
*NL*
at
was
a
large
knight
in
armour
who
was
shown
at
the
far
edge
of
the
*NL*
painting
.
He
was
leaning
on
his
sword
that
he
had
stuck
into
the
naked
*NL*
ground
in
front
of
him
where
only
a
few
blades
of
grass
grew
here
and
*NL*
there
.
He
seemed
to
be
paying
close
attention
to
something
that
was
*NL*
being
played
out
in
front
of
him
.
It
was
astonishing
to
see
how
he
*NL*
stood
there
without
going
any
closer
.
Perhaps
it
was
his
job
to
stand
*NL*
guard
.
It
was
a
long
time
since
K.
had
looked
at
any
pictures
and
he
*NL*
studied
the
knight
for
a
long
time
even
though
he
had
continually
to
*NL*
blink
as
he
found
it
difficult
to
bear
the
green
light
of
his
torch
.
*NL*
Then
when
he
moved
the
light
to
the
other
parts
of
the
picture
he
found
*NL*
an
interment
of
Christ
shown
in
the
usual
way
,
it
was
also
a
*NL*
comparatively
new
painting
.
He
put
his
torch
away
and
went
back
to
his
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
seemed
to
be
no
point
in
waiting
for
the
Italian
any
longer
,
*NL*
but
outside
it
was
certainly
raining
heavily
,
and
as
it
was
not
so
cold
*NL*
in
the
cathedral
as
K.
had
expected
he
decided
to
stay
there
for
the
*NL*
time
being
.
Close
by
him
was
the
great
pulpit
,
there
were
two
plain
*NL*
golden
crosses
attached
to
its
little
round
roof
which
were
lying
almost
*NL*
flat
and
whose
tips
crossed
over
each
other
.
The
outside
of
the
*NL*
pulpit
's
balustrade
was
covered
in
green
foliage
which
continued
down
to
*NL*
the
column
supporting
it
,
little
angels
could
be
seen
among
the
leaves
,
*NL*
some
of
them
lively
and
some
of
them
still
.
K.
walked
up
to
the
pulpit
*NL*
and
examined
it
from
all
sides
,
its
stonework
had
been
sculpted
with
*NL*
great
care
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
foliage
had
trapped
a
deep
darkness
*NL*
between
and
behind
its
leaves
and
held
it
there
prisoner
,
K.
lay
his
*NL*
hand
in
one
of
these
gaps
and
cautiously
felt
the
stone
,
until
then
he
*NL*
had
been
totally
unaware
of
this
pulpit
's
existence
.
Then
K.
happened
*NL*
to
notice
one
of
the
church
staff
standing
behind
the
next
row
of
pews
,
*NL*
he
wore
a
loose
,
creased
,
black
cassock
,
he
held
a
snuff
box
in
his
left
*NL*
hand
and
he
was
watching
K
.
Now
what
does
he
want
?
thought
K.
Do
I
*NL*
seem
suspicious
to
him
?
Does
he
want
a
tip
?
But
when
the
man
in
the
*NL*
cassock
saw
that
K.
had
noticed
him
he
raised
his
right
hand
,
a
pinch
of
*NL*
snuff
still
held
between
two
fingers
,
and
pointed
in
some
vague
*NL*
direction
.
It
was
almost
impossible
to
understand
what
this
behaviour
*NL*
meant
,
K.
waited
a
while
longer
but
the
man
in
the
cassock
did
not
stop
*NL*
gesturing
with
his
hand
and
even
augmented
it
by
nodding
his
head
.
``
Now
*NL*
what
does
he
want
?
''
asked
K.
quietly
,
he
did
not
dare
call
out
loud
*NL*
here
;
but
then
he
drew
out
his
purse
and
pushed
his
way
through
the
*NL*
nearest
pews
to
reach
the
man
.
He
,
however
,
immediately
gestured
to
*NL*
turn
down
this
offer
,
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
limped
away
.
As
a
*NL*
child
K.
had
imitated
riding
on
a
horse
with
the
same
sort
of
movement
*NL*
as
this
limp
.
``
This
old
man
is
like
a
child
,
''
thought
K.
,
``
he
does
n't
*NL*
have
the
sense
for
anything
more
than
serving
in
a
church
.
Look
at
the
*NL*
way
he
stops
when
I
stop
,
and
how
he
waits
to
see
whether
I
'll
*NL*
continue
.
''
With
a
smile
,
K.
followed
the
old
man
all
the
way
up
the
*NL*
side
nave
and
almost
as
far
as
the
main
altar
,
all
this
time
the
old
man
*NL*
continued
to
point
at
something
but
K.
deliberately
avoided
looking
*NL*
round
,
he
was
only
pointing
in
order
to
make
it
harder
for
K.
to
follow
*NL*
him
.
Eventually
,
K.
did
stop
following
,
he
did
not
want
to
worry
the
*NL*
old
man
too
much
,
and
he
also
did
not
want
to
frighten
him
away
*NL*
completely
in
case
the
Italian
turned
up
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
entered
the
central
nave
to
go
back
to
where
he
had
left
*NL*
the
album
,
he
noticed
a
small
secondary
pulpit
on
a
column
almost
next
*NL*
to
the
stalls
by
the
altar
where
the
choir
sat
.
It
was
very
simple
,
*NL*
made
of
plain
white
stone
,
and
so
small
that
from
a
distance
it
looked
*NL*
like
an
empty
niche
where
the
statue
of
a
saint
ought
to
have
been
.
It
*NL*
certainly
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
priest
to
take
a
full
step
*NL*
back
from
the
balustrade
,
and
,
although
there
was
no
decoration
on
it
,
*NL*
the
top
of
the
pulpit
curved
in
exceptionally
low
so
that
a
man
of
*NL*
average
height
would
not
be
able
stand
upright
and
would
have
to
remain
*NL*
bent
forward
over
the
balustrade
.
In
all
,
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
intended
to
make
the
priest
suffer
,
it
was
impossible
to
understand
why
*NL*
this
pulpit
would
be
needed
as
there
were
also
the
other
ones
available
*NL*
which
were
large
and
so
artistically
decorated
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
K.
would
certainly
not
have
noticed
this
little
pulpit
if
*NL*
there
had
not
been
a
lamp
fastened
above
it
,
which
usually
meant
there
*NL*
was
a
sermon
about
to
be
given
.
So
was
a
sermon
to
be
given
now
?
In
*NL*
this
empty
church
?
K.
looked
down
at
the
steps
which
,
pressed
close
*NL*
against
the
column
,
led
up
to
the
pulpit
.
They
were
so
narrow
they
*NL*
seemed
to
be
there
as
decoration
on
the
column
rather
than
for
anyone
to
*NL*
use
.
But
under
the
pulpit
-
K.
grinned
in
astonishment
-
there
really
*NL*
was
a
priest
standing
with
his
hand
on
the
handrail
ready
to
climb
the
*NL*
steps
and
looking
at
K
.
Then
he
nodded
very
slightly
,
so
that
K.
*NL*
crossed
himself
and
genuflected
as
he
should
have
done
earlier
.
With
a
*NL*
little
swing
,
the
priest
went
up
into
the
pulpit
with
short
fast
steps
.
*NL*
Was
there
really
a
sermon
about
to
begin
?
Maybe
the
man
in
the
cassock
*NL*
had
not
been
really
so
demented
,
and
had
meant
to
lead
K.
's
way
to
the
*NL*
preacher
,
which
in
this
empty
church
would
have
been
very
necessary
.
*NL*
And
there
was
also
,
somewhere
in
front
of
a
picture
of
the
Virgin
Mary
,
*NL*
an
old
woman
who
should
have
come
to
hear
the
sermon
.
And
if
there
was
*NL*
to
be
a
sermon
why
had
it
not
been
introduced
on
the
organ
?
But
the
*NL*
organ
remained
quiet
and
merely
looked
out
weakly
from
the
darkness
of
*NL*
its
great
height
.
*NL*
*NL*
K.
now
considered
whether
he
should
leave
as
quickly
as
possible
,
*NL*
if
he
did
not
do
it
now
there
would
be
no
chance
of
doing
so
during
the
*NL*
sermon
and
he
would
have
to
stay
there
for
as
long
as
it
lasted
,
he
had
*NL*
lost
so
much
time
when
he
should
have
been
in
his
office
,
there
had
long
*NL*
been
no
need
for
him
to
wait
for
the
Italian
any
longer
,
he
looked
at
*NL*
his
watch
,
it
was
eleven
.
But
could
there
really
be
a
sermon
given
?
*NL*
Could
K.
constitute
the
entire
congregation
?
How
could
he
when
he
was
*NL*
just
a
stranger
who
wanted
to
look
at
the
church
?
That
,
basically
,
was
*NL*
all
he
was
.
The
idea
of
a
sermon
,
now
,
at
eleven
o'clock
,
on
a
workday
,
*NL*
in
hideous
weather
,
was
nonsense
.
The
priest
-
there
was
no
doubt
that
*NL*
he
was
a
priest
,
a
young
man
with
a
smooth
,
dark
face
-
was
clearly
*NL*
going
up
there
just
to
put
the
lamp
out
after
somebody
had
lit
it
by
*NL*
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
had
been
no
mistake
,
the
priest
seemed
rather
to
check
*NL*
that
the
lamp
was
lit
and
turned
it
a
little
higher
,
then
he
slowly
*NL*
turned
to
face
the
front
and
leant
down
on
the
balustrade
gripping
its
*NL*
angular
rail
with
both
hands
.
He
stood
there
like
that
for
a
while
and
,
*NL*
without
turning
his
head
,
looked
around
.
K.
had
moved
back
a
long
way
*NL*
and
leant
his
elbows
on
the
front
pew
.
Somewhere
in
the
church
-
he
*NL*
could
not
have
said
exactly
where
-
he
could
make
out
the
man
in
the
*NL*
cassock
hunched
under
his
bent
back
and
at
peace
,
as
if
his
work
were
*NL*
completed
.
In
the
cathedral
it
was
now
very
quiet
!
But
K.
would
have
*NL*
to
disturb
that
silence
,
he
had
no
intention
of
staying
there
;
if
it
was
*NL*
the
priest
's
duty
to
preach
at
a
certain
time
regardless
of
the
*NL*
circumstances
then
he
could
,
and
he
could
do
it
without
K.
's
taking
*NL*
part
,
and
K.
's
presence
would
do
nothing
to
augment
the
effect
of
it
.
*NL*
So
K.
began
slowly
to
move
,
felt
his
way
on
tiptoe
along
the
pew
,
*NL*
arrived
at
the
broad
aisle
and
went
along
it
without
being
disturbed
,
*NL*
except
for
the
sound
of
his
steps
,
however
light
,
which
rang
out
on
the
*NL*
stone
floor
and
resounded
from
the
vaulting
,
quiet
but
continuous
at
a
*NL*
repeating
,
regular
pace
.
K.
felt
slightly
abandoned
as
,
probably
*NL*
observed
by
the
priest
,
he
walked
by
himself
between
the
empty
pews
,
and
*NL*
the
size
of
the
cathedral
seemed
to
be
just
at
the
limit
of
what
a
man
*NL*
could
bear
.
When
he
arrived
back
at
where
he
had
been
sitting
he
did
*NL*
not
hesitate
but
simply
reached
out
for
the
album
he
had
left
there
and
*NL*
took
it
with
him
.
He
had
nearly
left
the
area
covered
by
pews
and
was
*NL*
close
to
the
empty
space
between
himself
and
the
exit
when
,
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
he
heard
the
voice
of
the
priest
.
A
powerful
and
*NL*
experienced
voice
.
It
pierced
through
the
reaches
of
the
cathedral
*NL*
ready
waiting
for
it
!
But
the
priest
was
not
calling
out
to
the
*NL*
congregation
,
his
cry
was
quite
unambiguous
and
there
was
no
escape
from
*NL*
it
,
he
called
``
Josef
K.
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
K.
stood
still
and
looked
down
at
the
floor
.
In
theory
he
was
*NL*
still
free
,
he
could
have
carried
on
walking
,
through
one
of
three
dark
*NL*
little
wooden
doors
not
far
in
front
of
him
and
away
from
there
.
It
*NL*
would
simply
mean
he
had
not
understood
,
or
that
he
had
understood
but
*NL*
chose
not
to
pay
attention
to
it
.
But
if
he
once
turned
round
he
would
*NL*
be
trapped
,
then
he
would
have
acknowledged
that
he
had
understood
*NL*
perfectly
well
,
that
he
really
was
the
Josef
K.
the
priest
had
called
to
*NL*
and
that
he
was
willing
to
follow
.
If
the
priest
had
called
out
again
*NL*
K.
would
certainly
have
carried
on
out
the
door
,
but
everything
was
*NL*
silent
as
K.
also
waited
,
he
turned
his
head
slightly
as
he
wanted
to
*NL*
see
what
the
priest
was
doing
now
.
He
was
merely
standing
in
the
pulpit
*NL*
as
before
,
but
it
was
obvious
that
he
had
seen
K.
turn
his
head
.
If
K.
*NL*
did
not
now
turn
round
completely
it
would
have
been
like
a
child
*NL*
playing
hide
and
seek
.
He
did
so
,
and
the
priest
beckoned
him
with
his
*NL*
finger
.
As
everything
could
now
be
done
openly
he
ran
-
because
of
*NL*
curiosity
and
the
wish
to
get
it
over
with
-
with
long
flying
leaps
*NL*
towards
the
pulpit
.
At
the
front
pews
he
stopped
,
but
to
the
priest
he
*NL*
still
seemed
too
far
away
,
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
pointed
sharply
*NL*
down
with
his
finger
to
a
place
immediately
in
front
of
the
pulpit
.
And
*NL*
K.
did
as
he
was
told
,
standing
in
that
place
he
had
to
bend
his
head
a
*NL*
long
way
back
just
to
see
the
priest
.
``
You
are
Josef
K.
,
''
said
the
*NL*
priest
,
and
raised
his
hand
from
the
balustrade
to
make
a
gesture
whose
*NL*
meaning
was
unclear
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
K.
,
he
considered
how
freely
he
had
*NL*
always
given
his
name
in
the
past
,
for
some
time
now
it
had
been
a
*NL*
burden
to
him
,
now
there
were
people
who
knew
his
name
whom
he
had
never
*NL*
seen
before
,
it
had
been
so
nice
first
to
introduce
yourself
and
only
*NL*
then
for
people
to
know
who
you
were
.
``
You
have
been
accused
,
''
said
the
*NL*
priest
,
especially
gently
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
K.
,
``
so
I
have
been
informed
.
''
*NL*
``
Then
you
are
the
one
I
am
looking
for
,
''
said
the
priest
.
``
I
am
the
*NL*
prison
chaplain
.
''
``
I
see
,
''
said
K.
``
I
had
you
summoned
here
,
''
said
the
*NL*
priest
,
``
because
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
.
''
``
I
knew
nothing
of
that
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
``
I
came
here
to
show
the
cathedral
to
a
gentleman
from
Italy
.
''
*NL*
``
That
is
beside
the
point
,
''
said
the
priest
.
``
What
are
you
holding
in
*NL*
your
hand
?
Is
it
a
prayer
book
?
''
``
No
,
''
answered
K.
,
``
it
's
an
album
of
*NL*
the
city
's
tourist
sights
.
''
``
Put
it
down
,
''
said
the
priest
.
K.
threw
*NL*
it
away
with
such
force
that
it
flapped
open
and
rolled
across
the
*NL*
floor
,
tearing
its
pages
.
``
Do
you
know
your
case
is
going
badly
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
priest
.
``
That
's
how
it
seems
to
me
too
,
''
said
K.
``
I
've
expended
a
*NL*
lot
of
effort
on
it
,
but
so
far
with
no
result
.
Although
I
do
still
*NL*
have
some
documents
to
submit
.
''
``
How
do
you
imagine
it
will
end
?
''
asked
*NL*
the
priest
.
``
At
first
I
thought
it
was
bound
to
end
well
,
''
said
K.
,
*NL*
``
but
now
I
have
my
doubts
about
it
.
I
do
n't
know
how
it
will
end
.
Do
*NL*
you
know
?
''
``
I
do
n't
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
but
I
fear
it
will
end
badly
.
*NL*
You
are
considered
guilty
.
Your
case
will
probably
not
even
go
beyond
a
*NL*
minor
court
.
Provisionally
at
least
,
your
guilt
is
seen
as
proven
.
''
*NL*
``
But
I
'm
not
guilty
,
''
said
K.
,
``
there
's
been
a
mistake
.
How
is
it
even
*NL*
possible
for
someone
to
be
guilty
.
We
're
all
human
beings
here
,
one
*NL*
like
the
other
.
''
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
but
that
is
how
the
*NL*
guilty
speak
.
''
``
Do
you
presume
I
'm
guilty
too
?
''
asked
K.
``
I
make
no
*NL*
presumptions
about
you
,
''
said
the
priest
.
``
I
thank
you
for
that
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
``
but
everyone
else
involved
in
these
proceedings
has
something
*NL*
against
me
and
presumes
I
'm
guilty
.
They
even
influence
those
who
*NL*
are
n't
involved
.
My
position
gets
harder
all
the
time
.
''
``
You
do
n't
*NL*
understand
the
facts
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
the
verdict
does
not
come
*NL*
suddenly
,
proceedings
continue
until
a
verdict
is
reached
gradually
.
''
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
K.
,
lowering
his
head
.
``
What
do
you
intend
to
do
about
*NL*
your
case
next
?
''
asked
the
priest
.
``
I
still
need
to
find
help
,
''
said
*NL*
K.
,
raising
his
head
to
see
what
the
priest
thought
of
this
.
``
There
are
*NL*
still
certain
possibilities
I
have
n't
yet
made
use
of
.
''
``
You
look
for
*NL*
too
much
help
from
people
you
do
n't
know
,
''
said
the
priest
*NL*
disapprovingly
,
``
and
especially
from
women
.
Can
you
really
not
see
*NL*
that
's
not
the
help
you
need
?
''
``
Sometimes
,
in
fact
quite
often
,
I
could
*NL*
believe
you
're
right
,
''
said
K.
,
``
but
not
always
.
Women
have
a
lot
of
*NL*
power
.
If
I
could
persuade
some
of
the
women
I
know
to
work
together
*NL*
with
me
then
I
would
be
certain
to
succeed
.
Especially
in
a
court
like
*NL*
this
that
seems
to
consist
of
nothing
but
woman-chasers
.
Show
the
*NL*
examining
judge
a
woman
in
the
distance
and
he
'll
run
right
over
the
*NL*
desk
,
and
the
accused
,
just
to
get
to
her
as
soon
as
he
can
.
''
The
*NL*
priest
lowered
his
head
down
to
the
balustrade
,
only
now
did
the
roof
*NL*
over
the
pulpit
seem
to
press
him
down
.
What
sort
of
dreadful
weather
*NL*
could
it
be
outside
?
It
was
no
longer
just
a
dull
day
,
it
was
deepest
*NL*
night
.
None
of
the
stained
glass
in
the
main
window
shed
even
a
flicker
*NL*
of
light
on
the
darkness
of
the
walls
.
And
this
was
the
moment
when
the
*NL*
man
in
the
cassock
chose
to
put
out
the
candles
on
the
main
altar
,
one
*NL*
by
one
.
``
Are
you
cross
with
me
?
''
asked
K.
``
Maybe
you
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
sort
of
court
it
is
you
serve
.
''
He
received
no
answer
.
``
Well
,
it
's
*NL*
just
my
own
experience
,
''
said
K.
Above
him
there
was
still
silence
.
``
I
*NL*
did
n't
mean
to
insult
you
,
''
said
K
.
At
that
,
the
priest
screamed
down
*NL*
at
K.
:
``
Can
you
not
see
two
steps
in
front
of
you
?
''
He
shouted
in
*NL*
anger
,
but
it
was
also
the
scream
of
one
who
sees
another
fall
and
,
*NL*
shocked
and
without
thinking
,
screams
against
his
own
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
,
then
,
remained
silent
for
a
long
time
.
In
the
*NL*
darkness
beneath
him
,
the
priest
could
not
possibly
have
seen
K.
*NL*
distinctly
,
although
K.
was
able
to
see
him
clearly
by
the
light
of
the
*NL*
little
lamp
.
Why
did
the
priest
not
come
down
?
He
had
not
given
a
*NL*
sermon
,
he
had
only
told
K.
a
few
things
which
,
if
he
followed
them
*NL*
closely
,
would
probably
cause
him
more
harm
than
good
.
But
the
priest
*NL*
certainly
seemed
to
mean
well
,
it
might
even
be
possible
,
if
he
would
*NL*
come
down
and
cooperate
with
him
,
it
might
even
be
possible
for
him
to
*NL*
obtain
some
acceptable
piece
of
advice
that
could
make
all
the
*NL*
difference
,
it
might
,
for
instance
,
be
able
to
show
him
not
so
much
to
*NL*
influence
the
proceedings
but
how
to
break
free
of
them
,
how
to
evade
*NL*
them
,
how
to
live
away
from
them
.
K.
had
to
admit
that
this
was
*NL*
something
he
had
had
on
his
mind
quite
a
lot
of
late
.
If
the
priest
*NL*
knew
of
such
a
possibility
he
might
,
if
K.
asked
him
,
let
him
know
about
*NL*
it
,
even
though
he
was
part
of
the
court
himself
and
even
though
,
when
*NL*
K.
had
criticised
the
court
,
he
had
held
down
his
gentle
nature
and
*NL*
actually
shouted
at
K.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
not
like
to
come
down
here
?
''
asked
K.
``
If
you
're
not
*NL*
going
to
give
a
sermon
come
down
here
with
me
.
''
``
Now
I
can
come
down
,
''
*NL*
said
the
priest
,
perhaps
he
regretted
having
shouted
at
K
.
As
he
took
*NL*
down
the
lamp
from
its
hook
he
said
,
``
to
start
off
with
I
had
to
speak
*NL*
to
you
from
a
distance
.
Otherwise
I
'm
too
easily
influenced
and
forget
*NL*
my
duty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
K.
waited
for
him
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
.
While
he
was
still
on
*NL*
one
of
the
higher
steps
as
he
came
down
them
the
priest
reached
out
his
*NL*
hand
for
K.
to
shake
.
``
Can
you
spare
me
a
little
of
your
time
?
''
asked
*NL*
K.
``
As
much
time
as
you
need
,
''
said
the
priest
,
and
passed
him
the
*NL*
little
lamp
for
him
to
carry
.
Even
at
close
distance
the
priest
did
not
*NL*
lose
a
certain
solemnity
that
seemed
to
be
part
of
his
character
.
``
You
*NL*
are
very
friendly
towards
me
,
''
said
K.
,
as
they
walked
up
and
down
*NL*
beside
each
other
in
the
darkness
of
one
of
the
side
naves
.
``
That
makes
*NL*
you
an
exception
among
all
those
who
belong
to
the
court
.
I
can
trust
*NL*
you
more
than
any
of
the
others
I
've
seen
.
I
can
speak
openly
with
*NL*
you
.
''
``
Do
n't
fool
yourself
,
''
said
the
priest
.
``
How
would
I
be
fooling
*NL*
myself
?
''
asked
K.
``
You
fool
yourself
in
the
court
,
''
said
the
priest
,
*NL*
``
it
talks
about
this
self-deceit
in
the
opening
paragraphs
to
the
law
.
*NL*
In
front
of
the
law
there
is
a
doorkeeper
.
A
man
from
the
countryside
*NL*
comes
up
to
the
door
and
asks
for
entry
.
But
the
doorkeeper
says
he
*NL*
ca
n't
let
him
in
to
the
law
right
now
.
The
man
thinks
about
this
,
and
*NL*
then
he
asks
if
he
'll
be
able
to
go
in
later
on
.
`
That
's
possible
,
'
*NL*
says
the
doorkeeper
,
`
but
not
now
'
.
The
gateway
to
the
law
is
open
as
*NL*
it
always
is
,
and
the
doorkeeper
has
stepped
to
one
side
,
so
the
man
*NL*
bends
over
to
try
and
see
in
.
When
the
doorkeeper
notices
this
he
*NL*
laughs
and
says
,
`
If
you
're
tempted
give
it
a
try
,
try
and
go
in
even
*NL*
though
I
say
you
ca
n't
.
Careful
though
:
I
'm
powerful
.
And
I
'm
only
the
*NL*
lowliest
of
all
the
doormen
.
But
there
's
a
doorkeeper
for
each
of
the
*NL*
rooms
and
each
of
them
is
more
powerful
than
the
last
.
It
's
more
than
I
*NL*
can
stand
just
to
look
at
the
third
one
.
'
The
man
from
the
country
had
*NL*
not
expected
difficulties
like
this
,
the
law
was
supposed
to
be
*NL*
accessible
for
anyone
at
any
time
,
he
thinks
,
but
now
he
looks
more
*NL*
closely
at
the
doorkeeper
in
his
fur
coat
,
sees
his
big
hooked
nose
,
his
*NL*
long
thin
tartar-beard
,
and
he
decides
it
's
better
to
wait
until
he
has
*NL*
permission
to
enter
.
The
doorkeeper
gives
him
a
stool
and
lets
him
sit
*NL*
down
to
one
side
of
the
gate
.
He
sits
there
for
days
and
years
.
He
*NL*
tries
to
be
allowed
in
time
and
again
and
tires
the
doorkeeper
with
his
*NL*
requests
.
The
doorkeeper
often
questions
him
,
asking
about
where
he
's
*NL*
from
and
many
other
things
,
but
these
are
disinterested
questions
such
*NL*
as
great
men
ask
,
and
he
always
ends
up
by
telling
him
he
still
ca
n't
*NL*
let
him
in
.
The
man
had
come
well
equipped
for
his
journey
,
and
uses
*NL*
everything
,
however
valuable
,
to
bribe
the
doorkeeper
.
He
accepts
*NL*
everything
,
but
as
he
does
so
he
says
,
`
I
'll
only
accept
this
so
that
*NL*
you
do
n't
think
there
's
anything
you
've
failed
to
do
'
.
Over
many
years
,
*NL*
the
man
watches
the
doorkeeper
almost
without
a
break
.
He
forgets
about
*NL*
the
other
doormen
,
and
begins
to
think
this
one
is
the
only
thing
*NL*
stopping
him
from
gaining
access
to
the
law
.
Over
the
first
few
years
he
*NL*
curses
his
unhappy
condition
out
loud
,
but
later
,
as
he
becomes
old
,
he
*NL*
just
grumbles
to
himself
.
He
becomes
senile
,
and
as
he
has
come
to
know
*NL*
even
the
fleas
in
the
doorkeeper
's
fur
collar
over
the
years
that
he
has
*NL*
been
studying
him
he
even
asks
them
to
help
him
and
change
the
*NL*
doorkeeper
's
mind
.
Finally
his
eyes
grow
dim
,
and
he
no
longer
knows
*NL*
whether
it
's
really
getting
darker
or
just
his
eyes
that
are
deceiving
*NL*
him
.
But
he
seems
now
to
see
an
inextinguishable
light
begin
to
shine
*NL*
from
the
darkness
behind
the
door
.
He
does
n't
have
long
to
live
now
.
*NL*
Just
before
he
dies
,
he
brings
together
all
his
experience
from
all
this
*NL*
time
into
one
question
which
he
has
still
never
put
to
the
doorkeeper
.
*NL*
He
beckons
to
him
,
as
he
's
no
longer
able
to
raise
his
stiff
body
.
The
*NL*
doorkeeper
has
to
bend
over
deeply
as
the
difference
in
their
sizes
has
*NL*
changed
very
much
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
man
.
`
What
is
it
you
want
*NL*
to
know
now
?
'
asks
the
doorkeeper
,
`
You
're
insatiable
.
'
`
Everyone
wants
*NL*
access
to
the
law
,
'
says
the
man
,
`
how
come
,
over
all
these
years
,
no
-
*NL*
one
but
me
has
asked
to
be
let
in
?
'
The
doorkeeper
can
see
the
man
's
*NL*
come
to
his
end
,
his
hearing
has
faded
,
and
so
,
so
that
he
can
be
heard
,
*NL*
he
shouts
to
him
:
`
Nobody
else
could
have
got
in
this
way
,
as
this
*NL*
entrance
was
meant
only
for
you
.
Now
I
'll
go
and
close
it
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
the
doorkeeper
cheated
the
man
,
''
said
K.
immediately
,
who
had
*NL*
been
captivated
by
the
story
.
``
Do
n't
be
too
quick
,
''
said
the
priest
,
*NL*
``
do
n't
take
somebody
else
's
opinion
without
checking
it
.
I
told
you
the
*NL*
story
exactly
as
it
was
written
.
There
's
nothing
in
there
about
*NL*
cheating
.
''
``
But
it
's
quite
clear
,
''
said
K.
,
``
and
your
first
*NL*
interpretation
of
it
was
quite
correct
.
The
doorkeeper
gave
him
the
*NL*
information
that
would
release
him
only
when
it
could
be
of
no
more
*NL*
use
.
''
``
He
did
n't
ask
him
before
that
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
and
do
n't
*NL*
forget
he
was
only
a
doorkeeper
,
and
as
doorkeeper
he
did
his
duty
.
''
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
think
he
did
his
duty
?
''
asked
K.
,
``
He
did
n't
.
It
might
*NL*
have
been
his
duty
to
keep
everyone
else
away
,
but
this
man
is
who
the
*NL*
door
was
intended
for
and
he
ought
to
have
let
him
in
.
''
``
You
're
not
*NL*
paying
enough
attention
to
what
was
written
and
you
're
changing
the
*NL*
story
,
''
said
the
priest
.
``
According
to
the
story
,
there
are
two
*NL*
important
things
that
the
doorkeeper
explains
about
access
to
the
law
,
*NL*
one
at
the
beginning
,
one
at
the
end
.
At
one
place
he
says
he
ca
n't
*NL*
allow
him
in
now
,
and
at
the
other
he
says
this
entrance
was
intended
*NL*
for
him
alone
.
If
one
of
the
statements
contradicted
the
other
you
*NL*
would
be
right
and
the
doorkeeper
would
have
cheated
the
man
from
the
*NL*
country
.
But
there
is
no
contradiction
.
On
the
contrary
,
the
first
*NL*
statement
even
hints
at
the
second
.
You
could
almost
say
the
doorkeeper
*NL*
went
beyond
his
duty
in
that
he
offered
the
man
some
prospect
of
being
*NL*
admitted
in
the
future
.
Throughout
the
story
,
his
duty
seems
to
have
*NL*
been
merely
to
turn
the
man
away
,
and
there
are
many
commentators
who
*NL*
are
surprised
that
the
doorkeeper
offered
this
hint
at
all
,
as
he
seems
*NL*
to
love
exactitude
and
keeps
strict
guard
over
his
position
.
He
stays
*NL*
at
his
post
for
many
years
and
does
n't
close
the
gate
until
the
very
*NL*
end
,
he
's
very
conscious
of
the
importance
of
his
service
,
as
he
says
,
*NL*
`
I
'm
powerful
,
'
he
has
respect
for
his
superiors
,
as
he
says
,
`
I
'm
only
*NL*
the
lowliest
of
the
doormen
'
,
he
's
not
talkative
,
as
through
all
these
*NL*
years
the
only
questions
he
asks
are
`
disinterested
'
,
he
's
not
*NL*
corruptible
,
as
when
he
's
offered
a
gift
he
says
,
`
I
'll
only
accept
this
*NL*
so
that
you
do
n't
think
there
's
anything
you
've
failed
to
do
,
'
as
far
as
*NL*
fulfilling
his
duty
goes
he
can
be
neither
ruffled
nor
begged
,
as
it
*NL*
says
about
the
man
that
,
`
he
tires
the
doorkeeper
with
his
requests
'
,
*NL*
even
his
external
appearance
suggests
a
pedantic
character
,
the
big
*NL*
hooked
nose
and
the
long
,
thin
,
black
tartar-beard
.
How
could
any
*NL*
doorkeeper
be
more
faithful
to
his
duty
?
But
in
the
doorkeeper
's
*NL*
character
there
are
also
other
features
which
might
be
very
useful
for
*NL*
those
who
seek
entry
to
the
law
,
and
when
he
hinted
at
some
possibility
*NL*
in
the
future
it
always
seemed
to
make
it
clear
that
he
might
even
go
*NL*
beyond
his
duty
.
There
's
no
denying
he
's
a
little
simple
minded
,
and
*NL*
that
makes
him
a
little
conceited
.
Even
if
all
he
said
about
his
power
*NL*
and
the
power
of
the
other
doorkeepers
and
how
not
even
he
could
bear
*NL*
the
sight
of
them
-
I
say
even
if
all
these
assertions
are
right
,
the
*NL*
way
he
makes
them
shows
that
he
's
too
simple
and
arrogant
to
understand
*NL*
properly
.
The
commentators
say
about
this
that
,
`
correct
understanding
*NL*
of
a
matter
and
a
misunderstanding
of
the
same
matter
are
not
mutually
*NL*
exclusive
'
.
Whether
they
're
right
or
not
,
you
have
to
concede
that
his
*NL*
simplicity
and
arrogance
,
however
little
they
show
,
do
weaken
his
*NL*
function
of
guarding
the
entrance
,
they
are
defects
in
the
doorkeeper
's
*NL*
character
.
You
also
have
to
consider
that
the
doorkeeper
seems
to
be
*NL*
friendly
by
nature
,
he
is
n't
always
just
an
official
.
He
makes
a
joke
*NL*
right
at
the
beginning
,
in
that
he
invites
the
man
to
enter
at
the
same
*NL*
time
as
maintaining
the
ban
on
his
entering
,
and
then
he
does
n't
send
*NL*
him
away
but
gives
him
,
as
it
says
in
the
text
,
a
stool
to
sit
on
and
*NL*
lets
him
stay
by
the
side
of
the
door
.
The
patience
with
which
he
puts
*NL*
up
with
the
man
's
requests
through
all
these
years
,
the
little
*NL*
questioning
sessions
,
accepting
the
gifts
,
his
politeness
when
he
puts
*NL*
up
with
the
man
cursing
his
fate
even
though
it
was
the
doorkeeper
who
*NL*
caused
that
fate
-
all
these
things
seem
to
want
to
arouse
our
sympathy
.
*NL*
Not
every
doorkeeper
would
have
behaved
in
the
same
way
.
And
finally
,
*NL*
he
lets
the
man
beckon
him
and
he
bends
deep
down
to
him
so
that
he
can
*NL*
put
his
last
question
.
There
's
no
more
than
some
slight
impatience
-
*NL*
the
doorkeeper
knows
everything
's
come
to
its
end
-
shown
in
the
words
,
*NL*
`
You
're
insatiable
'
.
There
are
many
commentators
who
go
even
further
in
*NL*
explaining
it
in
this
way
and
think
the
words
,
`
you
're
insatiable
'
are
*NL*
an
expression
of
friendly
admiration
,
albeit
with
some
condescension
.
*NL*
However
you
look
at
it
the
figure
of
the
doorkeeper
comes
out
*NL*
differently
from
how
you
might
think
.
''
``
You
know
the
story
better
than
*NL*
I
do
and
you
've
known
it
for
longer
,
''
said
K
.
They
were
silent
for
a
*NL*
while
.
And
then
K.
said
,
``
So
you
think
the
man
was
not
cheated
,
do
*NL*
you
?
''
``
Do
n't
get
me
wrong
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
I
'm
just
pointing
out
the
*NL*
different
opinions
about
it
.
You
should
n't
pay
too
much
attention
to
*NL*
people
's
opinions
.
The
text
can
not
be
altered
,
and
the
various
opinions
*NL*
are
often
no
more
than
an
expression
of
despair
over
it
.
There
's
even
*NL*
one
opinion
which
says
it
's
the
doorkeeper
who
's
been
cheated
.
''
``
That
*NL*
does
seem
to
take
things
too
far
,
''
said
K.
``
How
can
they
argue
the
*NL*
doorkeeper
has
been
cheated
?
''
``
Their
argument
,
''
answered
the
priest
,
*NL*
``
is
based
on
the
simplicity
of
the
doorkeeper
.
They
say
the
doorkeeper
*NL*
does
n't
know
the
inside
of
the
law
,
only
the
way
into
it
where
he
just
*NL*
walks
up
and
down
.
They
see
his
ideas
of
what
's
inside
the
law
as
*NL*
rather
childish
,
and
suppose
he
's
afraid
himself
of
what
he
wants
to
*NL*
make
the
man
frightened
of
.
Yes
,
he
's
more
afraid
of
it
than
the
man
,
*NL*
as
the
man
wants
nothing
but
to
go
inside
the
law
,
even
after
he
's
heard
*NL*
about
the
terrible
doormen
there
,
in
contrast
to
the
doorkeeper
who
*NL*
does
n't
want
to
go
in
,
or
at
least
we
do
n't
hear
anything
about
it
.
On
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
there
are
those
who
say
he
must
have
already
been
inside
*NL*
the
law
as
he
has
been
taken
on
into
its
service
and
that
could
only
*NL*
have
been
done
inside
.
That
can
be
countered
by
supposing
he
could
have
*NL*
been
given
the
job
of
doorkeeper
by
somebody
calling
out
from
inside
,
*NL*
and
that
he
ca
n't
have
gone
very
far
inside
as
he
could
n't
bear
the
*NL*
sight
of
the
third
doorkeeper
.
Nor
,
through
all
those
years
,
does
the
*NL*
story
say
the
doorkeeper
told
the
man
anything
about
the
inside
,
other
*NL*
than
his
comment
about
the
other
doorkeepers
.
He
could
have
been
*NL*
forbidden
to
do
so
,
but
he
has
n't
said
anything
about
that
either
.
All
*NL*
this
seems
to
show
he
does
n't
know
anything
about
what
the
inside
looks
*NL*
like
or
what
it
means
,
and
that
that
's
why
he
's
being
deceived
.
But
*NL*
he
's
also
being
deceived
by
the
man
from
the
country
as
he
's
this
man
's
*NL*
subordinate
and
does
n't
know
it
.
There
's
a
lot
to
indicate
that
he
*NL*
treats
the
man
as
his
subordinate
,
I
expect
you
remember
,
but
those
who
*NL*
hold
this
view
would
say
it
's
very
clear
that
he
really
is
his
*NL*
subordinate
.
Above
all
,
the
free
man
is
superior
to
the
man
who
has
to
*NL*
serve
another
.
Now
,
the
man
really
is
free
,
he
can
go
wherever
he
*NL*
wants
,
the
only
thing
forbidden
to
him
is
entry
into
the
law
and
,
what
's
*NL*
more
,
there
's
only
one
man
forbidding
him
to
do
so
-
the
doorkeeper
.
If
*NL*
he
takes
the
stool
and
sits
down
beside
the
door
and
stays
there
all
his
*NL*
life
he
does
this
of
his
own
free
will
,
there
's
nothing
in
the
story
to
*NL*
say
he
was
forced
to
do
it
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
doorkeeper
is
kept
*NL*
to
his
post
by
his
employment
,
he
's
not
allowed
to
go
away
from
it
and
*NL*
it
seems
he
's
not
allowed
to
go
inside
either
,
not
even
if
he
wanted
to
.
*NL*
Also
,
although
he
's
in
the
service
of
the
law
he
's
only
there
for
this
*NL*
one
entrance
,
therefore
he
's
there
only
in
the
service
of
this
one
man
*NL*
who
the
door
's
intended
for
.
This
is
another
way
in
which
he
's
his
*NL*
subordinate
.
We
can
take
it
that
he
's
been
performing
this
somewhat
*NL*
empty
service
for
many
years
,
through
the
whole
of
a
man
's
life
,
as
it
*NL*
says
that
a
man
will
come
,
that
means
someone
old
enough
to
be
a
man
.
*NL*
That
means
the
doorkeeper
will
have
to
wait
a
long
time
before
his
*NL*
function
is
fulfilled
,
he
will
have
to
wait
for
as
long
as
the
man
*NL*
liked
,
who
came
to
the
door
of
his
own
free
will
.
Even
the
end
of
the
*NL*
doorkeeper
's
service
is
determined
by
when
the
man
's
life
ends
,
so
the
*NL*
doorkeeper
remains
his
subordinate
right
to
the
end
.
And
it
's
pointed
*NL*
out
repeatedly
that
the
doorkeeper
seems
to
know
nothing
of
any
of
this
,
*NL*
although
this
is
not
seen
as
anything
remarkable
,
as
those
who
hold
this
*NL*
view
see
the
doorkeeper
as
deluded
in
a
way
that
's
far
worse
,
a
way
*NL*
that
's
to
do
with
his
service
.
At
the
end
,
speaking
about
the
entrance
*NL*
he
says
,
`
Now
I
'll
go
and
close
it
'
,
although
at
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
story
it
says
the
door
to
the
law
is
open
as
it
always
is
,
but
if
it
's
*NL*
always
open
-
always
-
that
means
it
's
open
independently
of
the
*NL*
lifespan
of
the
man
it
's
intended
for
,
and
not
even
the
doorkeeper
will
*NL*
be
able
to
close
it
.
There
are
various
opinions
about
this
,
some
say
*NL*
the
doorkeeper
was
only
answering
a
question
or
showing
his
devotion
to
*NL*
duty
or
,
just
when
the
man
was
in
his
last
moments
,
the
doorkeeper
*NL*
wanted
to
cause
him
regret
and
sorrow
.
There
are
many
who
agree
that
he
*NL*
would
n't
be
able
to
close
the
door
.
They
even
believe
,
at
the
end
at
*NL*
least
,
the
doorkeeper
is
aware
,
deep
down
,
that
he
's
the
man
's
*NL*
subordinate
,
as
the
man
sees
the
light
that
shines
out
of
the
entry
to
*NL*
the
law
whereas
the
doorkeeper
would
probably
have
his
back
to
it
and
*NL*
says
nothing
at
all
to
show
there
's
been
any
change
.
''
``
That
is
well
*NL*
substantiated
,
''
said
K.
,
who
had
been
repeating
some
parts
of
the
*NL*
priest
's
explanation
to
himself
in
a
whisper
.
``
It
is
well
*NL*
substantiated
,
and
now
I
too
think
the
doorkeeper
must
have
been
*NL*
deceived
.
Although
that
does
not
mean
I
've
abandoned
what
I
thought
*NL*
earlier
as
the
two
versions
are
,
to
some
extent
,
not
incompatible
.
It
's
*NL*
not
clear
whether
the
doorkeeper
sees
clearly
or
is
deceived
.
I
said
*NL*
the
man
had
been
cheated
.
If
the
doorkeeper
understands
clearly
,
then
*NL*
there
could
be
some
doubt
about
it
,
but
if
the
doorkeeper
has
been
*NL*
deceived
then
the
man
is
bound
to
believe
the
same
thing
.
That
would
*NL*
mean
the
doorkeeper
is
not
a
cheat
but
so
simple-minded
that
he
ought
to
*NL*
be
dismissed
from
his
job
immediately
;
if
the
doorkeeper
is
mistaken
it
*NL*
will
do
him
no
harm
but
the
man
will
be
harmed
immensely
.
''
``
There
*NL*
you
've
found
another
opinion
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
as
there
are
many
who
*NL*
say
the
story
does
n't
give
anyone
the
right
to
judge
the
doorkeeper
.
*NL*
However
he
might
seem
to
us
he
is
still
in
the
service
of
the
law
,
so
he
*NL*
belongs
to
the
law
,
so
he
's
beyond
what
man
has
a
right
to
judge
.
In
*NL*
this
case
we
ca
n't
believe
the
doorkeeper
is
the
man
's
subordinate
.
*NL*
Even
if
he
has
to
stay
at
the
entrance
into
the
law
his
service
makes
*NL*
him
incomparably
more
than
if
he
lived
freely
in
the
world
.
The
man
has
*NL*
come
to
the
law
for
the
first
time
and
the
doorkeeper
is
already
there
.
*NL*
He
's
been
given
his
position
by
the
law
,
to
doubt
his
worth
would
be
to
*NL*
doubt
the
law
.
''
``
I
ca
n't
say
I
'm
in
complete
agreement
with
this
view
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
shaking
his
head
,
``
as
if
you
accept
it
you
'll
have
to
accept
*NL*
that
everything
said
by
the
doorkeeper
is
true
.
But
you
've
already
*NL*
explained
very
fully
that
that
's
not
possible
.
''
``
No
,
''
said
the
priest
,
*NL*
``
you
do
n't
need
to
accept
everything
as
true
,
you
only
have
to
accept
it
*NL*
as
necessary

''
``
Depressing
view
,
''
said
K.
``
The
lie
made
into
the
rule
*NL*
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
K.
said
that
as
if
it
were
his
final
word
but
it
was
not
his
*NL*
conclusion
.
He
was
too
tired
to
think
about
all
the
ramifications
of
*NL*
the
story
,
and
the
sort
of
thoughts
they
led
him
into
were
not
familiar
*NL*
to
him
,
unrealistic
things
,
things
better
suited
for
officials
of
the
*NL*
court
to
discuss
than
for
him
.
The
simple
story
had
lost
its
shape
,
he
*NL*
wanted
to
shake
it
off
,
and
the
priest
who
now
felt
quite
compassionate
*NL*
allowed
this
and
accepted
K.
's
remarks
without
comment
,
even
though
his
*NL*
view
was
certainly
very
different
from
K.
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
silence
,
they
carried
on
walking
for
some
time
,
K.
stayed
close
*NL*
beside
the
priest
without
knowing
where
he
was
.
The
lamp
in
his
hand
*NL*
had
long
since
gone
out
.
Once
,
just
in
front
of
him
,
he
thought
he
*NL*
could
see
the
statue
of
a
saint
by
the
glitter
of
the
silver
on
it
,
*NL*
although
it
quickly
disappeared
back
into
the
darkness
.
So
that
he
*NL*
would
not
remain
entirely
dependent
on
the
priest
,
K.
asked
him
,
``
We
're
*NL*
now
near
the
main
entrance
,
are
we
?
''
``
No
,
''
said
the
priest
,
``
we
're
a
*NL*
long
way
from
it
.
Do
you
already
want
to
go
?
''
K.
had
not
thought
of
*NL*
going
until
then
,
but
he
immediately
said
,
*NL*
``
Yes
,
certainly
,
I
have
to
go
.
I
'm
the
chief
clerk
in
a
bank
and
there
*NL*
are
people
waiting
for
me
,
I
only
came
here
to
show
a
foreign
business
*NL*
contact
round
the
cathedral
.
''
``
Alright
,
''
said
the
priest
offering
him
*NL*
his
hand
,
``
go
then
.
''
``
But
I
ca
n't
find
my
way
round
in
this
darkness
by
*NL*
myself
,
''
said
K.
``
Go
to
your
left
as
far
as
the
wall
,
''
said
the
priest
,
*NL*
``
then
continue
alongside
the
wall
without
leaving
it
and
you
'll
find
a
*NL*
way
out
.
''
The
priest
had
only
gone
a
few
paces
from
him
,
but
K.
was
*NL*
already
shouting
loudly
,
``
Please
,
wait
!
''
``
I
'm
waiting
,
''
said
the
*NL*
priest
.
``
Is
there
anything
else
you
want
from
me
?
''
asked
K.
``
No
,
''
said
*NL*
the
priest
.
``
You
were
so
friendly
to
me
earlier
on
,
''
said
K.
,
``
and
you
*NL*
explained
everything
,
but
now
you
abandon
me
as
if
I
were
nothing
to
*NL*
you
.
''
``
You
have
to
go
,
''
said
the
priest
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
''
said
K.
,
``
you
need
to
understand
that
.
''
``
First
,
you
need
*NL*
to
understand
who
I
am
,
''
said
the
priest
.
``
You
're
the
prison
chaplain
,
''
*NL*
said
K.
,
and
went
closer
to
the
priest
,
it
was
not
so
important
for
him
*NL*
to
go
straight
back
to
the
bank
as
he
had
made
out
,
he
could
very
well
*NL*
stay
where
he
was
.
``
So
that
means
I
belong
to
the
court
,
''
said
the
*NL*
priest
.
``
So
why
would
I
want
anything
from
you
?
the
court
does
n't
want
*NL*
anything
from
you
.
It
accepts
you
when
you
come
and
it
lets
you
go
when
*NL*
you
leave
.

Chapter
Ten
*NL*
End
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
before
K.
's
thirty-first
birthday
-
it
was
about
nine
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
the
time
when
the
streets
were
quiet
-
two
men
*NL*
came
to
where
he
lived
.
In
frock
coats
,
pale
and
fat
,
wearing
top
hats
*NL*
that
looked
like
they
could
not
be
taken
off
their
heads
.
After
some
*NL*
brief
formalities
at
the
door
of
the
flat
when
they
first
arrived
,
the
*NL*
same
formalities
were
repeated
at
greater
length
at
K.
's
door
.
He
had
*NL*
not
been
notified
they
would
be
coming
,
but
K.
sat
in
a
chair
near
the
*NL*
door
,
dressed
in
black
as
they
were
,
and
slowly
put
on
new
gloves
which
*NL*
stretched
tightly
over
his
fingers
and
behaved
as
if
he
were
expecting
*NL*
visitors
.
He
immediately
stood
up
and
looked
at
the
gentlemen
*NL*
inquisitively
.
``
You
've
come
for
me
then
,
have
you
?
''
he
asked
.
The
*NL*
gentlemen
nodded
,
one
of
them
indicated
the
other
with
the
top
hand
now
*NL*
in
his
hand
.
K.
told
them
he
had
been
expecting
a
different
visitor
.
*NL*
He
went
to
the
window
and
looked
once
more
down
at
the
dark
street
.
*NL*
Most
of
the
windows
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
were
also
dark
*NL*
already
,
many
of
them
had
the
curtains
closed
.
In
one
of
the
windows
on
*NL*
the
same
floor
where
there
was
a
light
on
,
two
small
children
could
be
*NL*
seen
playing
with
each
other
inside
a
playpen
,
unable
to
move
from
where
*NL*
they
were
,
reaching
out
for
each
other
with
their
little
hands
.
``
Some
*NL*
ancient
,
unimportant
actors
-
that
's
what
they
've
sent
for
me
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
to
himself
,
and
looked
round
once
again
to
confirm
this
to
himself
.
*NL*
``
They
want
to
sort
me
out
as
cheaply
as
they
can
.
''
K.
suddenly
turned
*NL*
round
to
face
the
two
men
and
asked
,
``
What
theatre
do
you
play
in
?
''
*NL*
``
Theatre
?
''
asked
one
of
the
gentlemen
,
turning
to
the
other
for
*NL*
assistance
and
pulling
in
the
corners
of
his
mouth
.
The
other
made
a
*NL*
gesture
like
someone
who
was
dumb
,
as
if
he
were
struggling
with
some
*NL*
organism
causing
him
trouble
.
``
You
're
not
properly
prepared
to
answer
*NL*
questions
,
''
said
K.
and
went
to
fetch
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
were
on
the
stairs
the
gentlemen
wanted
to
take
*NL*
K.
's
arms
,
but
K.
said
``
Wait
till
we
're
in
the
street
,
I
'm
not
ill
.
''
*NL*
But
they
waited
only
until
the
front
door
before
they
took
his
arms
in
a
*NL*
way
that
K.
had
never
experienced
before
.
They
kept
their
shoulders
*NL*
close
behind
his
,
did
not
turn
their
arms
in
but
twisted
them
around
the
*NL*
entire
length
of
K.
's
arms
and
took
hold
of
his
hands
with
a
grasp
that
*NL*
was
formal
,
experienced
and
could
not
be
resisted
.
K.
was
held
stiff
*NL*
and
upright
between
them
,
they
formed
now
a
single
unit
so
that
if
any
*NL*
one
of
them
had
been
knocked
down
all
of
them
must
have
fallen
.
They
*NL*
formed
a
unit
of
the
sort
that
normally
can
be
formed
only
by
matter
*NL*
that
is
lifeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
they
passed
under
a
lamp
K.
tried
to
see
his
companions
*NL*
more
clearly
,
as
far
as
was
possible
when
they
were
pressed
so
close
*NL*
together
,
as
in
the
dim
light
of
his
room
this
had
been
hardly
possible
.
*NL*
``
Maybe
they
're
tenors
,
''
he
thought
as
he
saw
their
big
double
chins
.
*NL*
The
cleanliness
of
their
faces
disgusted
him
.
He
could
see
the
hands
*NL*
that
cleaned
them
,
passing
over
the
corners
of
their
eyes
,
rubbing
at
*NL*
their
upper
lips
,
scratching
out
the
creases
on
those
chins
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
K.
noticed
that
,
he
stopped
,
which
meant
the
others
had
to
*NL*
stop
too
;
they
were
at
the
edge
of
an
open
square
,
devoid
of
people
but
*NL*
decorated
with
flower
beds
.
``
Why
did
they
send
you
,
of
all
people
!
''
he
*NL*
cried
out
,
more
a
shout
than
a
question
.
The
two
gentleman
clearly
knew
*NL*
no
answer
to
give
,
they
waited
,
their
free
arms
hanging
down
,
like
*NL*
nurses
when
the
patient
needs
to
rest
.
``
I
will
go
no
further
,
''
said
K.
*NL*
as
if
to
see
what
would
happen
.
The
gentlemen
did
not
need
to
make
any
*NL*
answer
,
it
was
enough
that
they
did
not
loosen
their
grip
on
K.
and
*NL*
tried
to
move
him
on
,
but
K.
resisted
them
.
``
I
'll
soon
have
no
need
of
*NL*
much
strength
,
I
'll
use
all
of
it
now
,
''
he
thought
.
He
thought
of
the
*NL*
flies
that
tear
their
legs
off
struggling
to
get
free
of
the
flypaper
.
*NL*
``
These
gentleman
will
have
some
hard
work
to
do
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
,
Miss
Buerstner
came
up
into
the
square
in
front
of
them
*NL*
from
the
steps
leading
from
a
small
street
at
a
lower
level
.
It
was
not
*NL*
certain
that
it
was
her
,
although
the
similarity
was
,
of
course
,
great
.
*NL*
But
it
did
not
matter
to
K.
whether
it
was
certainly
her
anyway
,
he
just
*NL*
became
suddenly
aware
that
there
was
no
point
in
his
resistance
.
There
*NL*
would
be
nothing
heroic
about
it
if
he
resisted
,
if
he
now
caused
*NL*
trouble
for
these
gentlemen
,
if
in
defending
himself
he
sought
to
enjoy
*NL*
his
last
glimmer
of
life
.
He
started
walking
,
which
pleased
the
*NL*
gentlemen
and
some
of
their
pleasure
conveyed
itself
to
him
.
Now
they
*NL*
permitted
him
to
decide
which
direction
they
took
,
and
he
decided
to
*NL*
take
the
direction
that
followed
the
young
woman
in
front
of
them
,
not
*NL*
so
much
because
he
wanted
to
catch
up
with
her
,
nor
even
because
he
*NL*
wanted
to
keep
her
in
sight
for
as
long
as
possible
,
but
only
so
that
he
*NL*
would
not
forget
the
reproach
she
represented
for
him
.
``
The
only
thing
*NL*
I
can
do
now
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
and
his
thought
was
confirmed
by
the
*NL*
equal
length
of
his
own
steps
with
the
steps
of
the
two
others
,
``
the
*NL*
only
thing
I
can
do
now
is
keep
my
common
sense
and
do
what
's
needed
*NL*
right
till
the
end
.
I
always
wanted
to
go
at
the
world
and
try
and
do
*NL*
too
much
,
and
even
to
do
it
for
something
that
was
not
too
cheap
.
That
*NL*
was
wrong
of
me
.
Should
I
now
show
them
I
learned
nothing
from
facing
*NL*
trial
for
a
year
?
Should
I
go
out
like
someone
stupid
?
Should
I
let
*NL*
anyone
say
,
after
I
'm
gone
,
that
at
the
start
of
the
proceedings
I
*NL*
wanted
to
end
them
,
and
that
now
that
they
've
ended
I
want
to
start
them
*NL*
again
?
I
do
n't
want
anyone
to
say
that
.
I
'm
grateful
they
sent
these
*NL*
unspeaking
,
uncomprehending
men
to
go
with
me
on
this
journey
,
and
that
*NL*
it
's
been
left
up
to
me
to
say
what
's
necessary
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
young
woman
had
turned
off
into
a
side
street
,
but
*NL*
K.
could
do
without
her
now
and
let
his
companions
lead
him
.
All
three
*NL*
of
them
now
,
in
complete
agreement
,
went
over
a
bridge
in
the
light
of
*NL*
the
moon
,
the
two
gentlemen
were
willing
to
yield
to
each
little
*NL*
movement
made
by
K.
as
he
moved
slightly
towards
the
edge
and
directed
*NL*
the
group
in
that
direction
as
a
single
unit
.
The
moonlight
glittered
*NL*
and
quivered
in
the
water
,
which
divided
itself
around
a
small
island
*NL*
covered
in
a
densely-piled
mass
of
foliage
and
trees
and
bushes
.
*NL*
Beneath
them
,
now
invisible
,
there
were
gravel
paths
with
comfortable
*NL*
benches
where
K.
had
stretched
himself
out
on
many
summer
's
days
.
``
I
*NL*
did
n't
actually
want
to
stop
here
,
''
he
said
to
his
companions
,
shamed
by
*NL*
their
compliance
with
his
wishes
.
Behind
K.
's
back
one
of
them
seemed
*NL*
to
quietly
criticise
the
other
for
the
misunderstanding
about
stopping
,
*NL*
and
then
they
went
on
.
The
went
on
up
through
several
streets
where
*NL*
policemen
were
walking
or
standing
here
and
there
;
some
in
the
distance
*NL*
and
then
some
very
close
.
One
of
them
with
a
bushy
moustache
,
his
hand
*NL*
on
the
grip
of
his
sword
,
seemed
to
have
some
purpose
in
approaching
*NL*
the
group
,
which
was
hardly
unsuspicious
.
The
two
gentlemen
stopped
,
*NL*
the
policeman
seemed
about
to
open
his
mouth
,
and
then
K.
drove
his
*NL*
group
forcefully
forward
.
Several
times
he
looked
back
cautiously
to
*NL*
see
if
the
policeman
was
following
;
but
when
they
had
a
corner
between
*NL*
themselves
and
the
policeman
K.
began
to
run
,
and
the
two
gentlemen
,
*NL*
despite
being
seriously
short
of
breath
,
had
to
run
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
they
quickly
left
the
built
up
area
and
found
*NL*
themselves
in
the
fields
which
,
in
this
part
of
town
,
began
almost
*NL*
without
any
transition
zone
.
There
was
a
quarry
,
empty
and
abandoned
,
*NL*
near
a
building
which
was
still
like
those
in
the
city
.
Here
the
men
*NL*
stopped
,
perhaps
because
this
had
always
been
their
destination
or
*NL*
perhaps
because
they
were
too
exhausted
to
run
any
further
.
Here
they
*NL*
released
their
hold
on
K.
,
who
just
waited
in
silence
,
and
took
their
*NL*
top
hats
off
while
they
looked
round
the
quarry
and
wiped
the
sweat
off
*NL*
their
brows
with
their
handkerchiefs
.
The
moonlight
lay
everywhere
with
*NL*
the
natural
peace
that
is
granted
to
no
other
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
exchanging
a
few
courtesies
about
who
was
to
carry
out
the
*NL*
next
tasks
-
the
gentlemen
did
not
seem
to
have
been
allocated
specific
*NL*
functions
-
one
of
them
went
to
K.
and
took
his
coat
,
his
waistcoat
,
and
*NL*
finally
his
shirt
off
him
.
K.
made
an
involuntary
shiver
,
at
which
the
*NL*
gentleman
gave
him
a
gentle
,
reassuring
tap
on
the
back
.
Then
he
*NL*
carefully
folded
the
things
up
as
if
they
would
still
be
needed
,
even
if
*NL*
not
in
the
near
future
.
He
did
not
want
to
expose
K.
to
the
chilly
*NL*
night
air
without
moving
though
,
so
he
took
him
under
the
arm
and
walked
*NL*
up
and
down
with
him
a
little
way
while
the
other
gentleman
looked
round
*NL*
the
quarry
for
a
suitable
place
.
When
he
had
found
it
he
made
a
sign
*NL*
and
the
other
gentleman
escorted
him
there
.
It
was
near
the
rockface
,
*NL*
there
was
a
stone
lying
there
that
had
broken
loose
.
The
gentlemen
sat
*NL*
K.
down
on
the
ground
,
leant
him
against
the
stone
and
settled
his
head
*NL*
down
on
the
top
of
it
.
Despite
all
the
effort
they
went
to
,
and
despite
*NL*
all
the
co-operation
shown
by
K.
,
his
demeanour
seemed
very
forced
and
*NL*
hard
to
believe
.
So
one
of
the
gentlemen
asked
the
other
to
grant
him
a
*NL*
short
time
while
he
put
K.
in
position
by
himself
,
but
even
that
did
*NL*
nothing
to
make
it
better
.
In
the
end
they
left
K.
in
a
position
that
*NL*
was
far
from
the
best
of
the
ones
they
had
tried
so
far
.
Then
one
of
*NL*
the
gentlemen
opened
his
frock
coat
and
from
a
sheath
hanging
on
a
belt
*NL*
stretched
across
his
waistcoat
he
withdrew
a
long
,
thin
,
double-edged
*NL*
butcher
's
knife
which
he
held
up
in
the
light
to
test
its
sharpness
.
*NL*
The
repulsive
courtesies
began
once
again
,
one
of
them
passed
the
knife
*NL*
over
K.
to
the
other
,
who
then
passed
it
back
over
K.
to
the
first
.
K.
*NL*
now
knew
it
would
be
his
duty
to
take
the
knife
as
it
passed
from
hand
*NL*
to
hand
above
him
and
thrust
it
into
himself
.
But
he
did
not
do
it
,
*NL*
instead
he
twisted
his
neck
,
which
was
still
free
,
and
looked
around
.
*NL*
He
was
not
able
to
show
his
full
worth
,
was
not
able
to
take
all
the
*NL*
work
from
the
official
bodies
,
he
lacked
the
rest
of
the
strength
he
*NL*
needed
and
this
final
shortcoming
was
the
fault
of
whoever
had
denied
it
*NL*
to
him
.
As
he
looked
round
,
he
saw
the
top
floor
of
the
building
next
*NL*
to
the
quarry
.
He
saw
how
a
light
flickered
on
and
the
two
halves
of
a
*NL*
window
opened
out
,
somebody
,
made
weak
and
thin
by
the
height
and
the
*NL*
distance
,
leant
suddenly
far
out
from
it
and
stretched
his
arms
out
even
*NL*
further
.
Who
was
that
?
A
friend
?
A
good
person
?
Somebody
who
was
*NL*
taking
part
?
Somebody
who
wanted
to
help
?
Was
he
alone
?
Was
it
*NL*
everyone
?
Would
anyone
help
?
Were
there
objections
that
had
been
*NL*
forgotten
?
There
must
have
been
some
.
The
logic
can
not
be
refuted
,
but
*NL*
someone
who
wants
to
live
will
not
resist
it
.
Where
was
the
judge
he
'd
*NL*
never
seen
?
Where
was
the
high
court
he
had
never
reached
?
He
raised
*NL*
both
hands
and
spread
out
all
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
hands
of
one
of
the
gentleman
were
laid
on
K.
's
throat
,
*NL*
while
the
other
pushed
the
knife
deep
into
his
heart
and
twisted
it
*NL*
there
,
twice
.
As
his
eyesight
failed
,
K.
saw
the
two
gentlemen
cheek
by
*NL*
cheek
,
close
in
front
of
his
face
,
watching
the
result
.
``
Like
a
dog
!
''
he
*NL*
said
,
it
was
as
if
the
shame
of
it
should
outlive
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
