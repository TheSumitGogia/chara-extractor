To
the

Honourable
Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
Sir
,
*NL*
*NL*
Never
poor
Wight
of
a
Dedicator
had
less
hopes
from
his
Dedication
,
*NL*
than
I
have
from
this
of
mine
;
for
it
is
written
in
a
bye
corner
of
the
*NL*
kingdom
,
and
in
a
retir
'd
thatch
'd
house
,
where
I
live
in
a
constant
*NL*
endeavour
to
fence
against
the
infirmities
of
ill
health
,
and
other
*NL*
evils
of
life
,
by
mirth
;
being
firmly
persuaded
that
every
time
a
man
*NL*
smiles
,
--
but
much
more
so
,
when
he
laughs
,
it
adds
something
to
this
*NL*
Fragment
of
Life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
humbly
beg
,
Sir
,
that
you
will
honour
this
book
,
by
taking
it
--
-LRB-
not
*NL*
under
your
Protection
,
--
it
must
protect
itself
,
but
-RRB-
--
into
the
country
*NL*
with
you
;
where
,
if
I
am
ever
told
,
it
has
made
you
smile
;
or
can
*NL*
conceive
it
has
beguiled
you
of
one
moment
's
pain
--
I
shall
think
myself
*NL*
as
happy
as
a
minister
of
state
;
--
perhaps
much
happier
than
any
one
-LRB-
one
*NL*
only
excepted
-RRB-
that
I
have
read
or
heard
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
,
Great
Sir
,
-LRB-
and
,
what
is
more
to
your
Honour
-RRB-
I
am
,
Good
Sir
,

*NL*
Well-wisher
,

most
humble

Chapter

.
I.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
either
my
father
or
my
mother
,
or
indeed
both
of
them
,
as
they
*NL*
were
in
duty
both
equally
bound
to
it
,
had
minded
what
they
were
about
*NL*
when
they
begot
me
;
had
they
duly
consider
'd
how
much
depended
upon
what
*NL*
they
were
then
doing
;
--
that
not
only
the
production
of
a
rational
*NL*
Being
was
concerned
in
it
,
but
that
possibly
the
happy
formation
and
*NL*
temperature
of
his
body
,
perhaps
his
genius
and
the
very
cast
of
his
*NL*
mind
;
--
and
,
for
aught
they
knew
to
the
contrary
,
even
the
fortunes
of
*NL*
his
whole
house
might
take
their
turn
from
the
humours
and
dispositions
*NL*
which
were
then
uppermost
;
--
Had
they
duly
weighed
and
considered
all
*NL*
this
,
and
proceeded
accordingly
,
--
I
am
verily
persuaded
I
should
have
*NL*
made
a
quite
different
figure
in
the
world
,
from
that
in
which
the
*NL*
reader
is
likely
to
see
me
.
--
Believe
me
,
good
folks
,
this
is
not
so
*NL*
inconsiderable
a
thing
as
many
of
you
may
think
it
;
--
you
have
all
,
I
*NL*
dare
say
,
heard
of
the
animal
spirits
,
as
how
they
are
transfused
from
*NL*
father
to
son
,
&
c.
&
c.
--
and
a
great
deal
to
that
purpose
:
--
Well
,
you
may
*NL*
take
my
word
,
that
nine
parts
in
ten
of
a
man
's
sense
or
his
nonsense
,
*NL*
his
successes
and
miscarriages
in
this
world
depend
upon
their
motions
*NL*
and
activity
,
and
the
different
tracks
and
trains
you
put
them
into
,
so
*NL*
that
when
they
are
once
set
a-going
,
whether
right
or
wrong
,
't
is
not
*NL*
a
half-penny
matter
,
--
away
they
go
cluttering
like
hey-go
mad
;
and
by
*NL*
treading
the
same
steps
over
and
over
again
,
they
presently
make
a
road
*NL*
of
it
,
as
plain
and
as
smooth
as
a
garden-walk
,
which
,
when
they
are
*NL*
once
used
to
,
the
Devil
himself
sometimes
shall
not
be
able
to
drive
*NL*
them
off
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pray
my
Dear
,
quoth
my
mother
,
have
you
not
forgot
to
wind
up
the
*NL*
clock
?
--
Good
G.
.
!
cried
my
father
,
making
an
exclamation
,
but
taking
*NL*
care
to
moderate
his
voice
at
the
same
time
,
--
Did
ever
woman
,
since
the
*NL*
creation
of
the
world
,
interrupt
a
man
with
such
a
silly
question
?
Pray
,
*NL*
what
was
your
father
saying
?
--
Nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
Chapter

II
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
,
positively
,
there
is
nothing
in
the
question
that
I
can
*NL*
see
,
either
good
or
bad
.
--
Then
,
let
me
tell
you
,
Sir
,
it
was
a
very
*NL*
unseasonable
question
at
least
,
--
because
it
scattered
and
dispersed
the
*NL*
animal
spirits
,
whose
business
it
was
to
have
escorted
and
gone
hand
in
*NL*
hand
with
the
Homunculus
,
and
conducted
him
safe
to
the
place
destined
*NL*
for
his
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Homunculus
,
Sir
,
in
however
low
and
ludicrous
a
light
he
may
appear
,
*NL*
in
this
age
of
levity
,
to
the
eye
of
folly
or
prejudice
;
--
to
the
eye
of
*NL*
reason
in
scientific
research
,
he
stands
confess
'd
--
a
Being
guarded
and
*NL*
circumscribed
with
rights
.
--
The
minutest
philosophers
,
who
by
the
bye
,
*NL*
have
the
most
enlarged
understandings
,
-LRB-
their
souls
being
inversely
as
*NL*
their
enquiries
-RRB-
shew
us
incontestably
,
that
the
Homunculus
is
created
*NL*
by
the
same
hand
,
--
engender
'd
in
the
same
course
of
nature
,
--
endow
'd
*NL*
with
the
same
loco-motive
powers
and
faculties
with
us
:
--
That
he
*NL*
consists
as
we
do
,
of
skin
,
hair
,
fat
,
flesh
,
veins
,
arteries
,
*NL*
ligaments
,
nerves
,
cartilages
,
bones
,
marrow
,
brains
,
glands
,
genitals
,
*NL*
humours
,
and
articulations
;
--
is
a
Being
of
as
much
activity
,
--
and
in
all
*NL*
senses
of
the
word
,
as
much
and
as
truly
our
fellow-creature
as
my
Lord
*NL*
Chancellor
of
England
.
--
He
may
be
benefitted
,
--
he
may
be
injured
,
--
he
*NL*
may
obtain
redress
;
in
a
word
,
he
has
all
the
claims
and
rights
of
*NL*
humanity
,
which
Tully
,
Puffendorf
,
or
the
best
ethick
writers
allow
to
*NL*
arise
out
of
that
state
and
relation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
dear
Sir
,
what
if
any
accident
had
befallen
him
in
his
way
*NL*
alone
!
--
or
that
through
terror
of
it
,
natural
to
so
young
a
traveller
,
*NL*
my
little
Gentleman
had
got
to
his
journey
's
end
miserably
spent
;
--
his
*NL*
muscular
strength
and
virility
worn
down
to
a
thread
;
--
his
own
animal
*NL*
spirits
ruffled
beyond
description
,
--
and
that
in
this
sad
disorder
'd
*NL*
state
of
nerves
,
he
had
lain
down
a
prey
to
sudden
starts
,
or
a
*NL*
series
of
melancholy
dreams
and
fancies
,
for
nine
long
,
long
months
*NL*
together
.
--
I
tremble
to
think
what
a
foundation
had
been
laid
for
*NL*
a
thousand
weaknesses
both
of
body
and
mind
,
which
no
skill
of
the
*NL*
physician
or
the
philosopher
could
ever
afterwards
have
set
thoroughly
*NL*
to
rights
.

*NL*
*NL*
To
my
uncle
Mr.
Toby
Shandy
do
I
stand
indebted
for
the
preceding
*NL*
anecdote
,
to
whom
my
father
,
who
was
an
excellent
natural
philosopher
,
*NL*
and
much
given
to
close
reasoning
upon
the
smallest
matters
,
had
oft
,
*NL*
and
heavily
complained
of
the
injury
;
but
once
more
particularly
,
as
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
well
remember
'd
,
upon
his
observing
a
most
unaccountable
*NL*
obliquity
,
-LRB-
as
he
call
'd
it
-RRB-
in
my
manner
of
setting
up
my
top
,
and
*NL*
justifying
the
principles
upon
which
I
had
done
it
,
--
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
shook
his
head
,
and
in
a
tone
more
expressive
by
half
of
sorrow
than
*NL*
reproach
,
--
he
said
his
heart
all
along
foreboded
,
and
he
saw
it
verified
*NL*
in
this
,
and
from
a
thousand
other
observations
he
had
made
upon
me
,
*NL*
That
I
should
neither
think
nor
act
like
any
other
man
's
child
:
--
But
*NL*
alas
!
continued
he
,
shaking
his
head
a
second
time
,
and
wiping
away
*NL*
a
tear
which
was
trickling
down
his
cheeks
,
My
Tristram
's
misfortunes
*NL*
began
nine
months
before
ever
he
came
into
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
mother
,
who
was
sitting
by
,
look
'd
up
,
but
she
knew
no
more
than
*NL*
her
backside
what
my
father
meant
,
--
but
my
uncle
,
Mr.
Toby
Shandy
,
who
*NL*
had
been
often
informed
of
the
affair
,
--
understood
him
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
Chapter

.
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
there
are
readers
in
the
world
,
as
well
as
many
other
good
people
*NL*
in
it
,
who
are
no
readers
at
all
,
--
who
find
themselves
ill
at
ease
,
*NL*
unless
they
are
let
into
the
whole
secret
from
first
to
last
,
of
every
*NL*
thing
which
concerns
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
in
pure
compliance
with
this
humour
of
theirs
,
and
from
a
*NL*
backwardness
in
my
nature
to
disappoint
any
one
soul
living
,
that
I
have
*NL*
been
so
very
particular
already
.
As
my
life
and
opinions
are
likely
to
*NL*
make
some
noise
in
the
world
,
and
,
if
I
conjecture
right
,
will
take
in
*NL*
all
ranks
,
professions
,
and
denominations
of
men
whatever
,
--
be
no
less
*NL*
read
than
the
Pilgrim
's
Progress
itself
--
and
in
the
end
,
prove
the
very
*NL*
thing
which
Montaigne
dreaded
his
Essays
should
turn
out
,
that
is
,
a
*NL*
book
for
a
parlour-window
;
--
I
find
it
necessary
to
consult
every
one
a
*NL*
little
in
his
turn
;
and
therefore
must
beg
pardon
for
going
on
a
little
*NL*
farther
in
the
same
way
:
For
which
cause
,
right
glad
I
am
,
that
I
have
*NL*
begun
the
history
of
myself
in
the
way
I
have
done
;
and
that
I
am
able
*NL*
to
go
on
,
tracing
every
thing
in
it
,
as
Horace
says
,
ab
Ovo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Horace
,
I
know
,
does
not
recommend
this
fashion
altogether
:
But
that
*NL*
gentleman
is
speaking
only
of
an
epic
poem
or
a
tragedy
;
--
-LRB-
I
*NL*
forget
which
,
-RRB-
besides
,
if
it
was
not
so
,
I
should
beg
Mr.
Horace
's
*NL*
pardon
;
--
for
in
writing
what
I
have
set
about
,
I
shall
confine
myself
*NL*
neither
to
his
rules
,
nor
to
any
man
's
rules
that
ever
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
such
however
as
do
not
choose
to
go
so
far
back
into
these
things
,
I
*NL*
can
give
no
better
advice
than
that
they
skip
over
the
remaining
part
of
*NL*
this
chapter
;
for
I
declare
before-hand
,
't
is
wrote
only
for
the
curious
*NL*
and
inquisitive
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Shut
the
door
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
begot
in
the
night
betwixt
the
first
Sunday
and
the
first
Monday
*NL*
in
the
month
of
March
,
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
seven
*NL*
hundred
and
eighteen
.
I
am
positive
I
was
.
--
But
how
I
came
to
be
so
very
*NL*
particular
in
my
account
of
a
thing
which
happened
before
I
was
born
,
*NL*
is
owing
to
another
small
anecdote
known
only
in
our
own
family
,
but
now
*NL*
made
publick
for
the
better
clearing
up
this
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
you
must
know
,
who
was
originally
a
Turkey
merchant
,
but
had
*NL*
left
off
business
for
some
years
,
in
order
to
retire
to
,
and
die
upon
,
*NL*
his
paternal
estate
in
the
county
of
--
,
was
,
I
believe
,
one
of
*NL*
the
most
regular
men
in
every
thing
he
did
,
whether
't
was
matter
of
*NL*
business
,
or
matter
of
amusement
,
that
ever
lived
.
As
a
small
specimen
*NL*
of
this
extreme
exactness
of
his
,
to
which
he
was
in
truth
a
slave
,
*NL*
he
had
made
it
a
rule
for
many
years
of
his
life
,
--
on
the
first
*NL*
Sunday-night
of
every
month
throughout
the
whole
year
,
--
as
certain
as
*NL*
ever
the
Sunday-night
came
,
--
to
wind
up
a
large
house-clock
,
which
we
*NL*
had
standing
on
the
back-stairs
head
,
with
his
own
hands
:
--
And
being
*NL*
somewhere
between
fifty
and
sixty
years
of
age
at
the
time
I
have
been
*NL*
speaking
of
,
--
he
had
likewise
gradually
brought
some
other
little
family
*NL*
concernments
to
the
same
period
,
in
order
,
as
he
would
often
say
to
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
to
get
them
all
out
of
the
way
at
one
time
,
and
be
no
more
*NL*
plagued
and
pestered
with
them
the
rest
of
the
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
attended
but
with
one
misfortune
,
which
,
in
a
great
measure
,
fell
*NL*
upon
myself
,
and
the
effects
of
which
I
fear
I
shall
carry
with
me
to
my
*NL*
grave
;
namely
,
that
from
an
unhappy
association
of
ideas
,
which
have
*NL*
no
connection
in
nature
,
it
so
fell
out
at
length
,
that
my
poor
mother
*NL*
could
never
hear
the
said
clock
wound
up
,
--
but
the
thoughts
of
some
*NL*
other
things
unavoidably
popped
into
her
head
--
&
vice
versa
:
--
Which
*NL*
strange
combination
of
ideas
,
the
sagacious
Locke
,
who
certainly
*NL*
understood
the
nature
of
these
things
better
than
most
men
,
affirms
*NL*
to
have
produced
more
wry
actions
than
all
other
sources
of
prejudice
*NL*
whatsoever
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
by
the
bye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
appears
by
a
memorandum
in
my
father
's
pocket-book
,
which
now
*NL*
lies
upon
the
table
,
`
That
on
Lady-day
,
which
was
on
the
25th
of
the
*NL*
same
month
in
which
I
date
my
geniture
,
--
my
father
set

However

*NL*
what
follows

On
the
fifth
day
of
November
,
1718
,
which
to
the
aera
fixed
on
,
was
*NL*
as
near
nine
kalendar
months
as
any
husband
could
in
reason
have
*NL*
expected
,
--
was
I
Tristram
Shandy
,
Gentleman
,
brought
forth
into
this
*NL*
scurvy
and
disastrous
world
of
ours
.
--
I
wish
I
had
been
born
in
the
*NL*
Moon
,
or
in
any
of
the
planets
,
-LRB-
except
Jupiter
or
Saturn
,
because
I
*NL*
never
could
bear
cold
weather
-RRB-
for
it
could
not
well
have
fared
worse
*NL*
with
me
in
any
of
them
-LRB-
though
I
will
not
answer
for
Venus
-RRB-
than
it
*NL*
has
in
this
vile
,
dirty
planet
of
ours
,
--
which
,
o
'
my
conscience
,
with
*NL*
reverence
be
it
spoken
,
I
take
to
be
made
up
of
the
shreds
and
clippings
*NL*
of
the
rest
;
--
not
but
the
planet
is
well
enough
,
provided
a
man
could
*NL*
be
born
in
it
to
a
great
title
or
to
a
great
estate
;
or
could
any
how
*NL*
contrive
to
be
called
up
to
public
charges
,
and
employments
of
dignity
*NL*
or
power
;
--
but
that
is
not
my
case
;
--
and
therefore
every
man
will
speak
*NL*
of
the
fair
as
his
own
market
has
gone
in
it
;
--
for
which
cause
I
affirm
*NL*
it
over
again
to
be
one
of
the
vilest
worlds
that
ever
was
made
;
--
for
I
*NL*
can
truly
say
,
that
from
the
first
hour
I
drew
my
breath
in
it
,
to
this
,
*NL*
that
I
can
now
scarce
draw
it
at
all
,
for
an
asthma
I
got
in
scating
*NL*
against
the
wind
in
Flanders
;
--
I
have
been
the
continual
sport
of
what
*NL*
the
world
calls
Fortune
;
and
though
I
will
not
wrong
her
by
saying
,
She
*NL*
has
ever
made
me
feel
the
weight
of
any
great
or
signal
evil
;
--
yet
with
*NL*
all
the
good
temper
in
the
world
I
affirm
it
of
her
,
that
in
every
stage
*NL*
of
my
life
,
and
at
every
turn
and
corner
where
she
could
get
fairly
*NL*
at
me
,
the
ungracious
duchess
has
pelted
me
with
a
set
of
as
pitiful
*NL*
misadventures
and
cross
accidents
as
ever
small
Hero
sustained

*NL*
In
the
beginning
of
the
last
chapter
,
I
informed
you
exactly
when
I
was
*NL*
born
;
but
I
did
not
inform
you
how
.
No
,
that
particular
was
reserved
*NL*
entirely
for
a
chapter
by
itself
;
--
besides
,
Sir
,
as
you
and
I
are
in
a
*NL*
manner
perfect
strangers
to
each
other
,
it
would
not
have
been
proper
to
*NL*
have
let
you
into
too
many
circumstances
relating
to
myself
all
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
must
have
a
little
patience
.
I
have
undertaken
,
you
see
,
to
write
*NL*
not
only
my
life
,
but
my
opinions
also
;
hoping
and
expecting
that
your
*NL*
knowledge
of
my
character
,
and
of
what
kind
of
a
mortal
I
am
,
by
the
*NL*
one
,
would
give
you
a
better
relish
for
the
other
:
As
you
proceed
*NL*
farther
with
me
,
the
slight
acquaintance
,
which
is
now
beginning
betwixt
*NL*
us
,
will
grow
into
familiarity
;
and
that
unless
one
of
us
is
in
fault
,
*NL*
will
terminate
in
friendship
.
--
O
diem
praeclarum
!
--
then
nothing
which
*NL*
has
touched
me
will
be
thought
trifling
in
its
nature
,
or
tedious
in
its
*NL*
telling
.
Therefore
,
my
dear
friend
and
companion
,
if
you
should
think
*NL*
me
somewhat
sparing
of
my
narrative
on
my
first
setting
out
--
bear
with
*NL*
me
,
--
and
let
me
go
on
,
and
tell
my
story
my
own
way
:
--
Or
,
if
I
should
*NL*
seem
now
and
then
to
trifle
upon
the
road
,
--
or
should
sometimes
put
on
*NL*
a
fool
's
cap
with
a
bell
to
it
,
for
a
moment
or
two
as
we
pass
*NL*
along
,
--
do
n't
fly
off
,
--
but
rather
courteously
give
me
credit
for
a
*NL*
little
more
wisdom
than
appears
upon
my
outside
;
--
and
as
we
jog
on
,
*NL*
either
laugh
with
me
,
or
at
me
,
or
in
short
do
any
thing
,
--
only
keep
*NL*
your
temper
.

*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
village
where
my
father
and
my
mother
dwelt
,
dwelt
also
a
*NL*
thin
,
upright
,
motherly
,
notable
,
good
old
body
of
a
midwife
,
who
with
*NL*
the
help
of
a
little
plain
good
sense
,
and
some
years
full
employment
*NL*
in
her
business
,
in
which
she
had
all
along
trusted
little
to
her
own
*NL*
efforts
,
and
a
great
deal
to
those
of
dame
Nature
,
--
had
acquired
,
in
her
*NL*
way
,
no
small
degree
of
reputation
in
the
world
:
--
by
which
word
world
,
*NL*
need
I
in
this
place
inform
your
worship
,
that
I
would
be
understood
to
*NL*
mean
no
more
of
it
,
than
a
small
circle
described
upon
the
circle
of
the
*NL*
great
world
,
of
four
English
miles
diameter
,
or
thereabouts
,
of
which
*NL*
the
cottage
where
the
good
old
woman
lived
is
supposed
to
be
the
*NL*
centre
?
--
She
had
been
left
it
seems
a
widow
in
great
distress
,
with
*NL*
three
or
four
small
children
,
in
her
forty-seventh
year
;
and
as
she
was
*NL*
at
that
time
a
person
of
decent
carriage
,
--
grave
deportment
,
--
a
*NL*
woman
moreover
of
few
words
and
withal
an
object
of
compassion
,
whose
*NL*
distress
,
and
silence
under
it
,
called
out
the
louder
for
a
friendly
*NL*
lift
:
the
wife
of
the
parson
of
the
parish
was
touched
with
pity
;
and
*NL*
having
often
lamented
an
inconvenience
to
which
her
husband
's
flock
had
*NL*
for
many
years
been
exposed
,
inasmuch
as
there
was
no
such
thing
as
a
*NL*
midwife
,
of
any
kind
or
degree
,
to
be
got
at
,
let
the
case
have
been
*NL*
never
so
urgent
,
within
less
than
six
or
seven
long
miles
riding
;
which
*NL*
said
seven
long
miles
in
dark
nights
and
dismal
roads
,
the
country
*NL*
thereabouts
being
nothing
but
a
deep
clay
,
was
almost
equal
to
fourteen
;
*NL*
and
that
in
effect
was
sometimes
next
to
having
no
midwife
at
all
;
it
*NL*
came
into
her
head
,
that
it
would
be
doing
as
seasonable
a
kindness
to
*NL*
the
whole
parish
,
as
to
the
poor
creature
herself
,
to
get
her
a
little
*NL*
instructed
in
some
of
the
plain
principles
of
the
business
,
in
order
*NL*
to
set
her
up
in
it
.
As
no
woman
thereabouts
was
better
qualified
to
*NL*
execute
the
plan
she
had
formed
than
herself
,
the
gentlewoman
very
*NL*
charitably
undertook
it
;
and
having
great
influence
over
the
female
part
*NL*
of
the
parish
,
she
found
no
difficulty
in
effecting
it
to
the
utmost
of
*NL*
her
wishes
.
In
truth
,
the
parson
join
'd
his
interest
with
his
wife
's
in
*NL*
the
whole
affair
,
and
in
order
to
do
things
as
they
should
be
,
and
give
*NL*
the
poor
soul
as
good
a
title
by
law
to
practise
,
as
his
wife
had
given
*NL*
by
institution
,
--
he
cheerfully
paid
the
fees
for
the
ordinary
's
licence
*NL*
himself
,
amounting
in
the
whole
,
to
the
sum
of
eighteen
shillings
and
*NL*
four
pence
;
so
that
betwixt
them
both
,
the
good
woman
was
fully
invested
*NL*
in
the
real
and
corporal
possession
of
her
office
,
together
with
all
its
*NL*
rights
,
members
,
and
appurtenances
whatsoever
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
last
words
,
you
must
know
,
were
not
according
to
the
old
form
in
*NL*
which
such
licences
,
faculties
,
and
powers
usually
ran
,
which
in
*NL*
like
cases
had
heretofore
been
granted
to
the
sisterhood
.
But
it
was
*NL*
according
to
a
neat
Formula
of
Didius
his
own
devising
,
who
having
a
*NL*
particular
turn
for
taking
to
pieces
,
and
new
framing
over
again
*NL*
all
kind
of
instruments
in
that
way
,
not
only
hit
upon
this
dainty
*NL*
amendment
,
but
coaxed
many
of
the
old
licensed
matrons
in
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
to
open
their
faculties
afresh
,
in
order
to
have
this
*NL*
wham-wham
of
his
inserted
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
own
I
never
could
envy
Didius
in
these
kinds
of
fancies
of
his
:
--
But
*NL*
every
man
to
his
own
taste
.
--
Did
not
Dr.
Kunastrokius
,
that
great
man
,
*NL*
at
his
leisure
hours
,
take
the
greatest
delight
imaginable
in
combing
of
*NL*
asses
tails
,
and
plucking
the
dead
hairs
out
with
his
teeth
,
though
he
*NL*
had
tweezers
always
in
his
pocket
?
Nay
,
if
you
come
to
that
,
Sir
,
have
*NL*
not
the
wisest
of
men
in
all
ages
,
not
excepting
Solomon
himself
,
--
have
*NL*
they
not
had
their
Hobby-Horses
;
--
their
running
horses
,
--
their
coins
*NL*
and
their
cockle-shells
,
their
drums
and
their
trumpets
,
their
fiddles
,
*NL*
their
pallets
,
--
their
maggots
and
their
butterflies
?
--
and
so
long
as
*NL*
a
man
rides
his
Hobby-Horse
peaceably
and
quietly
along
the
King
's
*NL*
highway
,
and
neither
compels
you
or
me
to
get
up
behind
him
,
--
pray

Sir

what
have
either
you
or
I
to
do
with
it
?

I
take
somewhat
longer
journies
than

would
think
altogether

But
the
truth
is
,

I
am
not
a
wise

man
;

and
besides
am
a
mortal
of
so
little
consequence
in
the
world
,
it
*NL*
is
not
much
matter
what
I
do

so
I
seldom
fret

fume
at

about

*NL*
Nor
does
it

disturb

when
I
see

tall

some
with
large

getting
on
in
a

more
grave

sober
pace
;

on

tucked
up
to
their

very

with

across

scouring

scampering

away
like
so
many

party-coloured
devils
astride

and
*NL*
as
if
some
of

were
resolved
to
break
their
necks
.

So
much
the
*NL*
better

say
I
to
myself
;

for
in
case
the
worst
should
happen
,
the
*NL*
world
will
make
a
shift
to
do
excellently
well
without
them
;
and
for
*NL*
the
rest
,
--
why
--
God
speed
them
--
e
`
en
let
them
ride
on
without
opposition

from
me
;
for
were
their
lordships
unhorsed
this

't
is
ten

*NL*
Not
one
of
these
instances
therefore
can
be
said
to
break
in
upon
my
*NL*
rest
.

But
there
is
an
instance
,
which
I
own
puts
me
off
my
guard
,
and
*NL*
that
is
,
when
I
see
one
born
for
great
actions
,
and
what
is
still
more
*NL*
for
his
honour
,
whose
nature
ever
inclines
him
to
good
ones
;
--
when
I
*NL*
behold
such
a
one
,
my
Lord
,
like
yourself
,
whose
principles
and
conduct
*NL*
are
as
generous
and
noble
as
his
blood
,
and
whom
,
for
that
reason
,
a
*NL*
corrupt
world
can
not
spare
one
moment
;

when
I
see
such
a
one
,
my
Lord

*NL*
mounted
,
though
it
is
but
for
a
minute
beyond
the
time
which
my
love
*NL*
to
my
country
has
prescribed
to
him
,
and
my
zeal
for
his
glory

then
,

I
cease
to
be

in

*NL*
*NL*
I
solemnly
declare
to
all
mankind
,
that
the
above
dedication
was
made
*NL*
for
no
one
Prince
,
Prelate
,
Pope
,
or
Potentate
,
--
Duke
,
Marquis
,
Earl
,
*NL*
Viscount
,
or
Baron
,
of
this
,
or
any
other
Realm
in
Christendom
;
--
nor
has
*NL*
it
yet
been
hawked
about
,
or
offered
publicly
or
privately
,
directly
*NL*
or
indirectly
,
to
any
one
person
or
personage
,
great
or
small
;
but
is
*NL*
honestly
a
true
Virgin-Dedication
untried
on
,
upon
any
soul
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
labour
this
point
so
particularly
,
merely
to
remove
any
offence
*NL*
or
objection
which
might
arise
against
it
from
the
manner
in
which
I
*NL*
propose
to
make
the
most
of
it
;
--
which
is
the
putting
it
up
fairly
to
*NL*
public
sale
;
which
I
now
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Every
author
has
a
way
of
his
own
in
bringing
his
points
to
bear
;
--
for
*NL*
my
own
part
,
as
I
hate
chaffering
and
higgling
for
a
few
guineas
in
a
*NL*
dark
entry
;
--
I
resolved
within
myself
,
from
the
very
beginning
,
to
*NL*
deal
squarely
and
openly
with
your
Great
Folks
in
this
affair
,
and
try
*NL*
whether
I
should
not
come
off
the
better
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
therefore
there
is
any
one
Duke
,
Marquis
,
Earl
,
Viscount
,
or
Baron
,
*NL*
in
these
his
Majesty
's
dominions
,
who
stands
in
need
of
a
tight
,
genteel
*NL*
dedication
,
and
whom
the
above
will
suit
,
-LRB-
for
by
the
bye
,
unless
*NL*
it
suits
in
some
degree
,
I
will
not
part
with
it
-RRB-
--
it
is
much
at
his
*NL*
service
for
fifty
guineas
;
--
which
I
am
positive
is
twenty
guineas
less
*NL*
than
it
ought
to
be
afforded
for
,
by
any
man
of
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
Lord
,
if
you
examine
it
over
again
,
it
is
far
from
being
a
gross
*NL*
piece
of
daubing
,
as
some
dedications
are
.
The
design
,
your
Lordship
*NL*
sees
,
is
good
,
--
the
colouring
transparent
,
--
the
drawing
not
amiss
;
--
or
*NL*
to
speak
more
like
a
man
of
science
,
--
and
measure
my
piece
in
the
*NL*
painter
's
scale
,
divided
into
20
,
--
I
believe
,
my
Lord
,
the
outlines
*NL*
will
turn
out
as
12
,
--
the
composition
as
9
,
--
the
colouring
as
6
,
--
the
*NL*
expression
13
and
a
half
,
--
and
the
design
,
--
if
I
may
be
allowed
,
my
*NL*
Lord
,
to
understand
my
own
design
,
and
supposing
absolute
perfection
*NL*
in
designing
,
to
be
as
20
,
--
I
think
it
can
not
well
fall
short
of
19
.
*NL*
Besides
all
this
,
--
there
is
keeping
in
it
,
and
the
dark
strokes
in
the
*NL*
Hobby-Horse
,
-LRB-
which
is
a
secondary
figure
,
and
a
kind
of
back-ground
to
*NL*
the
whole
-RRB-
give
great
force
to
the
principal
lights
in
your
own
figure
,
*NL*
and
make
it
come
off
wonderfully
;
--
and
besides
,
there
is
an
air
of
*NL*
originality
in
the
tout
ensemble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
pleased
,
my
good
Lord
,
to
order
the
sum
to
be
paid
into
the
hands
of
*NL*
Mr.
Dodsley
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
author
;
and
in
the
next
edition
*NL*
care
shall
be
taken
that
this
chapter
be
expunged
,
and
your
Lordship
's
*NL*
titles
,
distinctions
,
arms
,
and
good
actions
,
be
placed
at
the
front
of
*NL*
the
preceding
chapter
:
All
which
,
from
the
words
,
De
gustibus
non
est
*NL*
disputandum
,
and
whatever
else
in
this
book
relates
to
Hobby-Horses
,
but
*NL*
no
more
,
shall
stand
dedicated
to
your
Lordship
.
--
The
rest
I
dedicate
to
*NL*
the
Moon
,
who
,
by
the
bye
,
of
all
the
Patrons
or
Matrons
I
can
think
of
,
*NL*
has
most
power
to
set
my
book
a-going
,
and
make
the
world
run
mad
after
*NL*
it

*NL*
Whatever
degree
of
small
merit
the
act
of
benignity
in
favour
of
the
*NL*
midwife
might
justly
claim
,
or
in
whom
that
claim
truly
rested
,
--
at
*NL*
first
sight
seems
not
very
material
to
this
history
;
--
certain
however
it
*NL*
was
,
that
the
gentlewoman
,
the
parson
's
wife
,
did
run
away
at
that
time
*NL*
with
the
whole
of
it
:
And
yet
,
for
my
life
,
I
can
not
help
thinking
but
*NL*
that
the
parson
himself
,
though
he
had
not
the
good
fortune
to
hit
upon
*NL*
the
design
first
,
--
yet
,
as
he
heartily
concurred
in
it
the
moment
it
was
*NL*
laid
before
him
,
and
as
heartily
parted
with
his
money
to
carry
it
into
*NL*
execution
,
had
a
claim
to
some
share
of
it
,
--
if
not
to
a
full
half
of
*NL*
whatever
honour
was
due
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
world
at
that
time
was
pleased
to
determine
the
matter
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lay
down
the
book
,
and
I
will
allow
you
half
a
day
to
give
a
probable
*NL*
guess
at
the
grounds
of
this
procedure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
it
known
then
,
that
,
for
about
five
years
before
the
date
of
*NL*
the
midwife
's
licence
,
of
which
you
have
had
so
circumstantial
an
*NL*
account
,
--
the
parson
we
have
to
do
with
had
made
himself
a
country-talk
*NL*
by
a
breach
of
all
decorum
,
which
he
had
committed
against
himself
,
his
*NL*
station
,
and
his
office
;
--
and
that
was
in
never
appearing
better
,
or
*NL*
otherwise
mounted
,
than
upon
a
lean
,
sorry
,
jackass
of
a
horse
,
value
*NL*
about
one
pound
fifteen
shillings
;
who
,
to
shorten
all
description
of
*NL*
him
,
was
full
brother
to
Rosinante
,
as
far
as
similitude
congenial
could
*NL*
make
him
;
for
he
answered
his
description
to
a
hair-breadth
in
every
*NL*
thing
,
--
except
that
I
do
not
remember
't
is
any
where
said
,
that
*NL*
Rosinante
was
broken-winded
;
and
that
,
moreover
,
Rosinante
,
as
is
the
*NL*
happiness
of
most
Spanish
horses
,
fat
or
lean
,
--
was
undoubtedly
a
horse
*NL*
at
all
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
very
well
that
the
Hero
's
horse
was
a
horse
of
chaste
deportment
,
*NL*
which
may
have
given
grounds
for
the
contrary
opinion
:
But
it
is
*NL*
as
certain
at
the
same
time
that
Rosinante
's
continency
-LRB-
as
may
be
*NL*
demonstrated
from
the
adventure
of
the
Yanguesian
carriers
-RRB-
proceeded
*NL*
from
no
bodily
defect
or
cause
whatsoever
,
but
from
the
temperance
and
*NL*
orderly
current
of
his
blood
.
--
And
let
me
tell
you
,
Madam
,
there
is
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
very
good
chastity
in
the
world
,
in
behalf
of
which
you
*NL*
could
not
say
more
for
your
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
that
be
as
it
may
,
as
my
purpose
is
to
do
exact
justice
to
every
*NL*
creature
brought
upon
the
stage
of
this
dramatic
work
,
--
I
could
not
*NL*
stifle
this
distinction
in
favour
of
Don
Quixote
's
horse
;
--
in
all
other
*NL*
points
,
the
parson
's
horse
,
I
say
,
was
just
such
another
,
for
he
was
as
*NL*
lean
,
and
as
lank
,
and
as
sorry
a
jade
,
as
Humility
herself
could
have
*NL*
bestrided
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
estimation
of
here
and
there
a
man
of
weak
judgment
,
it
was
*NL*
greatly
in
the
parson
's
power
to
have
helped
the
figure
of
this
horse
of
*NL*
his
,
--
for
he
was
master
of
a
very
handsome
demi-peaked
saddle
,
*NL*
quilted
on
the
seat
with
green
plush
,
garnished
with
a
double
row
of
*NL*
silver-headed
studs
,
and
a
noble
pair
of
shining
brass
stirrups
,
with
a
*NL*
housing
altogether
suitable
,
of
grey
superfine
cloth
,
with
an
edging
of
*NL*
black
lace
,
terminating
in
a
deep
,
black
,
silk
fringe
,
poudre
d'or
,
--
all
*NL*
which
he
had
purchased
in
the
pride
and
prime
of
his
life
,
together
with
*NL*
a
grand
embossed
bridle
,
ornamented
at
all
points
as
it
should
be
.
--
But
*NL*
not
caring
to
banter
his
beast
,
he
had
hung
all
these
up
behind
his
*NL*
study
door
:
and
,
in
lieu
of
them
,
had
seriously
befitted
him
with
just
*NL*
such
a
bridle
and
such
a
saddle
,
as
the
figure
and
value
of
such
a
steed
*NL*
might
well
and
truly
deserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
several
sallies
about
his
parish
,
and
in
the
neighbouring
visits
*NL*
to
the
gentry
who
lived
around
him
,
--
you
will
easily
comprehend
,
that
*NL*
the
parson
,
so
appointed
,
would
both
hear
and
see
enough
to
keep
his
*NL*
philosophy
from
rusting
.
To
speak
the
truth
,
he
never
could
enter
a
*NL*
village
,
but
he
caught
the
attention
of
both
old
and
young
.
--
Labour
*NL*
stood
still
as
he
pass
'd
--
the
bucket
hung
suspended
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
well
,
--
the
spinning-wheel
forgot
its
round
,
--
even
chuck-farthing
and
*NL*
shuffle-cap
themselves
stood
gaping
till
he
had
got
out
of
sight
;
and
as
*NL*
his
movement
was
not
of
the
quickest
,
he
had
generally
time
enough
*NL*
upon
his
hands
to
make
his
observations
,
--
to
hear
the
groans
of
the
*NL*
serious
,
--
and
the
laughter
of
the
light-hearted
;
all
which
he
bore
with
*NL*
excellent
tranquillity
.
--
His
character
was
,
--
he
loved
a
jest
in
his
*NL*
heart
--
and
as
he
saw
himself
in
the
true
point
of
ridicule
,
he
would
say
*NL*
he
could
not
be
angry
with
others
for
seeing
him
in
a
light
,
in
which
he
*NL*
so
strongly
saw
himself
:
So
that
to
his
friends
,
who
knew
his
foible
*NL*
was
not
the
love
of
money
,
and
who
therefore
made
the
less
scruple
in
*NL*
bantering
the
extravagance
of
his
humour
,
--
instead
of
giving
the
true
*NL*
cause
,
--
he
chose
rather
to
join
in
the
laugh
against
himself
;
and
as
*NL*
he
never
carried
one
single
ounce
of
flesh
upon
his
own
bones
,
being
*NL*
altogether
as
spare
a
figure
as
his
beast
,
--
he
would
sometimes
insist
*NL*
upon
it
,
that
the
horse
was
as
good
as
the
rider
deserved
;
--
that
they
*NL*
were
,
centaur-like
,
--
both
of
a
piece
.
At
other
times
,
and
in
other
*NL*
moods
,
when
his
spirits
were
above
the
temptation
of
false
wit
,
--
he
*NL*
would
say
,
he
found
himself
going
off
fast
in
a
consumption
;
and
,
with
*NL*
great
gravity
,
would
pretend
,
he
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
a
fat
*NL*
horse
,
without
a
dejection
of
heart
,
and
a
sensible
alteration
in
his
*NL*
pulse
;
and
that
he
had
made
choice
of
the
lean
one
he
rode
upon
,
not
*NL*
only
to
keep
himself
in
countenance
,
but
in
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
different
times
he
would
give
fifty
humorous
and
apposite
reasons
for
*NL*
riding
a
meek-spirited
jade
of
a
broken-winded
horse
,
preferably
to
one
*NL*
of
mettle
;
--
for
on
such
a
one
he
could
sit
mechanically
,
and
meditate
as
*NL*
delightfully
de
vanitate
mundi
et
fuga
saeculi
,
as
with
the
advantage
of
*NL*
a
death
's
-
head
before
him
;
--
that
,
in
all
other
exercitations
,
he
could
*NL*
spend
his
time
,
as
he
rode
slowly
along
,
--
to
as
much
account
as
in
his
*NL*
study
;
--
that
he
could
draw
up
an
argument
in
his
sermon
,
--
or
a
hole
*NL*
in
his
breeches
,
as
steadily
on
the
one
as
in
the
other
;
--
that
brisk
*NL*
trotting
and
slow
argumentation
,
like
wit
and
judgment
,
were
two
*NL*
incompatible
movements
.
--
But
that
upon
his
steed
--
he
could
unite
and
*NL*
reconcile
every
thing
,
--
he
could
compose
his
sermon
--
he
could
compose
*NL*
his
cough
,
--
and
,
in
case
nature
gave
a
call
that
way
,
he
could
likewise
*NL*
compose
himself
to
sleep
.
--
In
short
,
the
parson
upon
such
encounters
*NL*
would
assign
any
cause
but
the
true
cause
,
--
and
he
withheld
the
true
*NL*
one
,
only
out
of
a
nicety
of
temper
,
because
he
thought
it
did
honour
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
truth
of
the
story
was
as
follows
:
In
the
first
years
of
this
*NL*
gentleman
's
life
,
and
about
the
time
when
the
superb
saddle
and
bridle
*NL*
were
purchased
by
him
,
it
had
been
his
manner
,
or
vanity
,
or
call
it
*NL*
what
you
will
,
--
to
run
into
the
opposite
extreme
.
--
In
the
language
of
*NL*
the
county
where
he
dwelt
,
he
was
said
to
have
loved
a
good
horse
,
and
*NL*
generally
had
one
of
the
best
in
the
whole
parish
standing
in
his
stable
*NL*
always
ready
for
saddling
:
and
as
the
nearest
midwife
,
as
I
told
you
,
*NL*
did
not
live
nearer
to
the
village
than
seven
miles
,
and
in
a
vile
*NL*
country
,
--
it
so
fell
out
that
the
poor
gentleman
was
scarce
a
whole
week
*NL*
together
without
some
piteous
application
for
his
beast
;
and
as
he
was
*NL*
not
an
unkind-hearted
man
,
and
every
case
was
more
pressing
and
more
*NL*
distressful
than
the
last
;
--
as
much
as
he
loved
his
beast
,
he
had
never
*NL*
a
heart
to
refuse
him
;
the
upshot
of
which
was
generally
this
;
that
*NL*
his
horse
was
either
clapp
'd
,
or
spavin
'd
,
or
greaz
'd
;
--
or
he
was
*NL*
twitter-bon
'd
,
or
broken-winded
,
or
something
,
in
short
,
or
other
had
*NL*
befallen
him
,
which
would
let
him
carry
no
flesh
;
--
so
that
he
had
every
*NL*
nine
or
ten
months
a
bad
horse
to
get
rid
of
,
--
and
a
good
horse
to
*NL*
purchase
in
his
stead
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
the
loss
in
such
a
balance
might
amount
to
,
communibus
annis
,
I
*NL*
would
leave
to
a
special
jury
of
sufferers
in
the
same
traffick
,
to
*NL*
determine
;
--
but
let
it
be
what
it
would
,
the
honest
gentleman
bore
*NL*
it
for
many
years
without
a
murmur
,
till
at
length
,
by
repeated
ill
*NL*
accidents
of
the
kind
,
he
found
it
necessary
to
take
the
thing
under
*NL*
consideration
;
and
upon
weighing
the
whole
,
and
summing
it
up
in
his
*NL*
mind
,
he
found
it
not
only
disproportioned
to
his
other
expences
,
but
*NL*
withal
so
heavy
an
article
in
itself
,
as
to
disable
him
from
any
other
*NL*
act
of
generosity
in
his
parish
:
Besides
this
,
he
considered
that
*NL*
with
half
the
sum
thus
galloped
away
,
he
could
do
ten
times
as
*NL*
much
good
;
--
and
what
still
weighed
more
with
him
than
all
other
*NL*
considerations
put
together
,
was
this
,
that
it
confined
all
his
charity
*NL*
into
one
particular
channel
,
and
where
,
as
he
fancied
,
it
was
the
least
*NL*
wanted
,
namely
,
to
the
child-bearing
and
child-getting
part
of
*NL*
his
parish
;
reserving
nothing
for
the
impotent
,
--
nothing
for
the
*NL*
aged
,
--
nothing
for
the
many
comfortless
scenes
he
was
hourly
called
*NL*
forth
to
visit
,
where
poverty
,
and
sickness
and
affliction
dwelt
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
these
reasons
he
resolved
to
discontinue
the
expence
;
and
there
*NL*
appeared
but
two
possible
ways
to
extricate
him
clearly
out
of
it
;
--
and
*NL*
these
were
,
either
to
make
it
an
irrevocable
law
never
more
to
lend
his
*NL*
steed
upon
any
application
whatever
,
--
or
else
be
content
to
ride
the
*NL*
last
poor
devil
,
such
as
they
had
made
him
,
with
all
his
aches
and
*NL*
infirmities
,
to
the
very
end
of
the
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
dreaded
his
own
constancy
in
the
first
--
he
very
chearfully
betook
*NL*
himself
to
the
second
;
and
though
he
could
very
well
have
explained
it
,
*NL*
as
I
said
,
to
his
honour
,
--
yet
,
for
that
very
reason
,
he
had
a
spirit
*NL*
above
it
;
choosing
rather
to
bear
the
contempt
of
his
enemies
,
and
the
*NL*
laughter
of
his
friends
,
than
undergo
the
pain
of
telling
a
story
,
which
*NL*
might
seem
a
panegyrick
upon
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
the
highest
idea
of
the
spiritual
and
refined
sentiments
of
this
*NL*
reverend
gentleman
,
from
this
single
stroke
in
his
character
,
which
I
*NL*
think
comes
up
to
any
of
the
honest
refinements
of
the
peerless
knight
*NL*
of
La
Mancha
,
whom
,
by
the
bye
,
with
all
his
follies
,
I
love
more
,
*NL*
and
would
actually
have
gone
farther
to
have
paid
a
visit
to
,
than
the
*NL*
greatest
hero
of
antiquity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
is
not
the
moral
of
my
story
:
The
thing
I
had
in
view
was
to
*NL*
shew
the
temper
of
the
world
in
the
whole
of
this
affair
.
--
For
you
*NL*
must
know
,
that
so
long
as
this
explanation
would
have
done
the
parson
*NL*
credit
,
--
the
devil
a
soul
could
find
it
out
,
--
I
suppose
his
enemies
*NL*
would
not
,
and
that
his
friends
could
not
.
--
But
no
sooner
did
he
bestir
*NL*
himself
in
behalf
of
the
midwife
,
and
pay
the
expences
of
the
ordinary
's
*NL*
licence
to
set
her
up
,
--
but
the
whole
secret
came
out
;
every
horse
*NL*
he
had
lost
,
and
two
horses
more
than
ever
he
had
lost
,
with
all
*NL*
the
circumstances
of
their
destruction
,
were
known
and
distinctly
*NL*
remembered
.
--
The
story
ran
like
wild-fire
.
--
`
The
parson
had
a
returning
*NL*
fit
of
pride
which
had
just
seized
him
;
and
he
was
going
to
be
well
*NL*
mounted
once
again
in
his
life
;
and
if
it
was
so
,
't
was
plain
as
the
sun
*NL*
at
noon-day
,
he
would
pocket
the
expence
of
the
licence
ten
times
told
,
*NL*
the
very
first
year
:
--
So
that
every
body
was
left
to
judge
what
were
his
*NL*
views
in
this
act
of
charity
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
What
were
his
views
in
this
,
and
in
every
other
action
of
his
life
,
--
or
*NL*
rather
what
were
the
opinions
which
floated
in
the
brains
of
other
*NL*
people
concerning
it
,
was
a
thought
which
too
much
floated
in
his
own
,
*NL*
and
too
often
broke
in
upon
his
rest
,
when
he
should
have
been
sound
*NL*
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
ten
years
ago
this
gentleman
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
made
*NL*
entirely
easy
upon
that
score
,
--
it
being
just
so
long
since
he
left
his
*NL*
parish
,
--
and
the
whole
world
at
the
same
time
behind
him
,
--
and
stands
*NL*
accountable
to
a
Judge
of
whom
he
will
have
no
cause
to
complain
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
is
a
fatality
attends
the
actions
of
some
men
:
Order
them
*NL*
as
they
will
,
they
pass
thro
'
a
certain
medium
,
which
so
twists
and
*NL*
refracts
them
from
their
true
directions
--
that
,
with
all
the
titles
*NL*
to
praise
which
a
rectitude
of
heart
can
give
,
the
doers
of
them
are
*NL*
nevertheless
forced
to
live
and
die
without
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
truth
of
which
,
this
gentleman
was
a
painful
example
.
--
But
to
*NL*
know
by
what
means
this
came
to
pass
,
--
and
to
make
that
knowledge
of
use
*NL*
to
you
,
I
insist
upon
it
that
you
read
the
two
following
chapters
,
which
*NL*
contain
such
a
sketch
of
his
life
and
conversation
,
as
will
carry
its
*NL*
moral
along
with
it
.
--
When
this
is
done
,
if
nothing
stops
us
in
our
way
,
*NL*
we
will
go
on
with
the
midwife
.

Chapter
1
.
XI
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yorick
was
this
parson
's
name
,
and
,
what
is
very
remarkable
in
it
,
-LRB-
as
*NL*
appears
from
a
most
ancient
account
of
the
family
,
wrote
upon
strong
*NL*
vellum
,
and
now
in
perfect
preservation
-RRB-
it
had
been
exactly
so
spelt
*NL*
for
near
,
--
I
was
within
an
ace
of
saying
nine
hundred
years
;
--
but
*NL*
I
would
not
shake
my
credit
in
telling
an
improbable
truth
,
however
*NL*
indisputable
in
itself
,
--
and
therefore
I
shall
content
myself
with
only
*NL*
saying
--
It
had
been
exactly
so
spelt
,
without
the
least
variation
or
*NL*
transposition
of
a
single
letter
,
for
I
do
not
know
how
long
;
which
is
*NL*
more
than
I
would
venture
to
say
of
one
half
of
the
best
surnames
in
the
*NL*
kingdom
;
which
,
in
a
course
of
years
,
have
generally
undergone
as
many
*NL*
chops
and
changes
as
their
owners
.
--
Has
this
been
owing
to
the
pride
,
*NL*
or
to
the
shame
of
the
respective
proprietors
?
--
In
honest
truth
,
I
think
*NL*
sometimes
to
the
one
,
and
sometimes
to
the
other
,
just
as
the
temptation
*NL*
has
wrought
.
But
a
villainous
affair
it
is
,
and
will
one
day
so
blend
*NL*
and
confound
us
all
together
,
that
no
one
shall
be
able
to
stand
up
and
*NL*
swear
,
`
That
his
own
great
grandfather
was
the
man
who
did
either
this
*NL*
or
that
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
evil
had
been
sufficiently
fenced
against
by
the
prudent
care
of
*NL*
the
Yorick
's
family
,
and
their
religious
preservation
of
these
records
*NL*
I
quote
,
which
do
farther
inform
us
,
That
the
family
was
originally
of
*NL*
Danish
extraction
,
and
had
been
transplanted
into
England
as
early
as
in
*NL*
the
reign
of
Horwendillus
,
king
of
Denmark
,
in
whose
court
,
it
seems
,
an
*NL*
ancestor
of
this
Mr.
Yorick
's
,
and
from
whom
he
was
lineally
descended
,
*NL*
held
a
considerable
post
to
the
day
of
his
death
.
Of
what
nature
this
*NL*
considerable
post
was
,
this
record
saith
not
;
--
it
only
adds
,
That
,
*NL*
for
near
two
centuries
,
it
had
been
totally
abolished
,
as
altogether
*NL*
unnecessary
,
not
only
in
that
court
,
but
in
every
other
court
of
the
*NL*
Christian
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
often
come
into
my
head
,
that
this
post
could
be
no
other
than
*NL*
that
of
the
king
's
chief
Jester
;
--
and
that
Hamlet
's
Yorick
,
in
*NL*
our
Shakespeare
,
many
of
whose
plays
,
you
know
,
are
founded
upon
*NL*
authenticated
facts
,
was
certainly
the
very
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
not
the
time
to
look
into
Saxo-Grammaticus
's
Danish
history
,
to
*NL*
know
the
certainty
of
this
;
--
but
if
you
have
leisure
,
and
can
easily
get
*NL*
at
the
book
,
you
may
do
it
full
as
well
yourself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
just
time
,
in
my
travels
through
Denmark
with
Mr.
Noddy
's
eldest
*NL*
son
,
whom
,
in
the
year
1741
,
I
accompanied
as
governor
,
riding
along
*NL*
with
him
at
a
prodigious
rate
thro
'
most
parts
of
Europe
,
and
of
which
*NL*
original
journey
performed
by
us
two
,
a
most
delectable
narrative
will
*NL*
be
given
in
the
progress
of
this
work
.
I
had
just
time
,
I
say
,
and
that
*NL*
was
all
,
to
prove
the
truth
of
an
observation
made
by
a
long
sojourner
*NL*
in
that
country
;
--
namely
,
`
That
nature
was
neither
very
lavish
,
nor
*NL*
was
she
very
stingy
in
her
gifts
of
genius
and
capacity
to
its
*NL*
inhabitants
;
--
but
,
like
a
discreet
parent
,
was
moderately
kind
to
them
*NL*
all
;
observing
such
an
equal
tenor
in
the
distribution
of
her
favours
,
*NL*
as
to
bring
them
,
in
those
points
,
pretty
near
to
a
level
with
each
*NL*
other
;
so
that
you
will
meet
with
few
instances
in
that
kingdom
of
*NL*
refined
parts
;
but
a
great
deal
of
good
plain
houshold
understanding
*NL*
amongst
all
ranks
of
people
,
of
which
every
body
has
a
share
;
'
which
is
,
*NL*
I
think
,
very
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
us
,
you
see
,
the
case
is
quite
different
:
--
we
are
all
ups
and
downs
*NL*
in
this
matter
;
--
you
are
a
great
genius
;
--
or
't
is
fifty
to
one
,
Sir
,
you
*NL*
are
a
great
dunce
and
a
blockhead
;
--
not
that
there
is
a
total
want
of
*NL*
intermediate
steps
,
--
no
,
--
we
are
not
so
irregular
as
that
comes
to
;
--
but
*NL*
the
two
extremes
are
more
common
,
and
in
a
greater
degree
in
this
*NL*
unsettled
island
,
where
nature
,
in
her
gifts
and
dispositions
of
this
*NL*
kind
,
is
most
whimsical
and
capricious
;
fortune
herself
not
being
more
*NL*
so
in
the
bequest
of
her
goods
and
chattels
than
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
all
that
ever
staggered
my
faith
in
regard
to
Yorick
's
*NL*
extraction
,
who
,
by
what
I
can
remember
of
him
,
and
by
all
the
accounts
*NL*
I
could
ever
get
of
him
,
seemed
not
to
have
had
one
single
drop
of
*NL*
Danish
blood
in
his
whole
crasis
;
in
nine
hundred
years
,
it
might
*NL*
possibly
have
all
run
out
:
--
I
will
not
philosophize
one
moment
with
you
*NL*
about
it
;
for
happen
how
it
would
,
the
fact
was
this
:
--
That
instead
of
*NL*
that
cold
phlegm
and
exact
regularity
of
sense
and
humours
,
you
would
*NL*
have
looked
for
,
in
one
so
extracted
;
--
he
was
,
on
the
contrary
,
as
*NL*
mercurial
and
sublimated
a
composition
,
--
as
heteroclite
a
creature
in
*NL*
all
his
declensions
;
--
with
as
much
life
and
whim
,
and
gaite
de
coeur
*NL*
about
him
,
as
the
kindliest
climate
could
have
engendered
and
put
*NL*
together
.
With
all
this
sail
,
poor
Yorick
carried
not
one
ounce
of
*NL*
ballast
;
he
was
utterly
unpractised
in
the
world
;
and
at
the
age
of
*NL*
twenty-six
,
knew
just
about
as
well
how
to
steer
his
course
in
it
,
as
a
*NL*
romping
,
unsuspicious
girl
of
thirteen
:
So
that
upon
his
first
setting
*NL*
out
,
the
brisk
gale
of
his
spirits
,
as
you
will
imagine
,
ran
him
foul
*NL*
ten
times
in
a
day
of
somebody
's
tackling
;
and
as
the
grave
and
more
*NL*
slow-paced
were
oftenest
in
his
way
,
--
you
may
likewise
imagine
,
't
was
*NL*
with
such
he
had
generally
the
ill
luck
to
get
the
most
entangled
.
For
*NL*
aught
I
know
there
might
be
some
mixture
of
unlucky
wit
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
such
Fracas
:
--
For
,
to
speak
the
truth
,
Yorick
had
an
invincible
dislike
*NL*
and
opposition
in
his
nature
to
gravity
;
--
not
to
gravity
as
such
;
--
for
*NL*
where
gravity
was
wanted
,
he
would
be
the
most
grave
or
serious
of
*NL*
mortal
men
for
days
and
weeks
together
;
--
but
he
was
an
enemy
to
the
*NL*
affectation
of
it
,
and
declared
open
war
against
it
,
only
as
it
appeared
*NL*
a
cloak
for
ignorance
,
or
for
folly
:
and
then
,
whenever
it
fell
in
his
*NL*
way
,
however
sheltered
and
protected
,
he
seldom
gave
it
much
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
in
his
wild
way
of
talking
,
he
would
say
,
that
Gravity
was
*NL*
an
errant
scoundrel
,
and
he
would
add
,
--
of
the
most
dangerous
kind
*NL*
too
,
--
because
a
sly
one
;
and
that
he
verily
believed
,
more
honest
,
*NL*
well-meaning
people
were
bubbled
out
of
their
goods
and
money
by
it
in
*NL*
one
twelve-month
,
than
by
pocket-picking
and
shop-lifting
in
seven
.
In
*NL*
the
naked
temper
which
a
merry
heart
discovered
,
he
would
say
there
*NL*
was
no
danger
,
--
but
to
itself
:
--
whereas
the
very
essence
of
gravity
was
*NL*
design
,
and
consequently
deceit
;
--
't
was
a
taught
trick
to
gain
credit
of
*NL*
the
world
for
more
sense
and
knowledge
than
a
man
was
worth
;
and
that
,
*NL*
with
all
its
pretensions
,
--
it
was
no
better
,
but
often
worse
,
than
what
*NL*
a
French
wit
had
long
ago
defined
it
,
--
viz
.
'
A
mysterious
carriage
*NL*
of
the
body
to
cover
the
defects
of
the
mind
;
'
--
which
definition
of
*NL*
gravity
,
Yorick
,
with
great
imprudence
,
would
say
,
deserved
to
be
wrote
*NL*
in
letters
of
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
in
plain
truth
,
he
was
a
man
unhackneyed
and
unpractised
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
was
altogether
as
indiscreet
and
foolish
on
every
other
*NL*
subject
of
discourse
where
policy
is
wont
to
impress
restraint
.
Yorick
*NL*
had
no
impression
but
one
,
and
that
was
what
arose
from
the
nature
of
*NL*
the
deed
spoken
of
;
which
impression
he
would
usually
translate
into
*NL*
plain
English
without
any
periphrasis
;
--
and
too
oft
without
much
*NL*
distinction
of
either
person
,
time
,
or
place
;
--
so
that
when
mention
was
*NL*
made
of
a
pitiful
or
an
ungenerous
proceeding
--
he
never
gave
himself
*NL*
a
moment
's
time
to
reflect
who
was
the
hero
of
the
piece
,
--
what
his
*NL*
station
,
--
or
how
far
he
had
power
to
hurt
him
hereafter
;
--
but
if
it
was
*NL*
a
dirty
action
,
--
without
more
ado
,
--
The
man
was
a
dirty
fellow
,
--
and
*NL*
so
on
.
--
And
as
his
comments
had
usually
the
ill
fate
to
be
terminated
*NL*
either
in
a
bon
mot
,
or
to
be
enlivened
throughout
with
some
drollery
or
*NL*
humour
of
expression
,
it
gave
wings
to
Yorick
's
indiscretion
.
In
a
*NL*
word
,
tho
'
he
never
sought
,
yet
,
at
the
same
time
,
as
he
seldom
shunned
*NL*
occasions
of
saying
what
came
uppermost
,
and
without
much
ceremony
;
--
he
*NL*
had
but
too
many
temptations
in
life
,
of
scattering
his
wit
and
his
*NL*
humour
,
--
his
gibes
and
his
jests
about
him
.
--
They
were
not
lost
for
want
*NL*
of
gathering
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
were
the
consequences
,
and
what
was
Yorick
's
catastrophe
thereupon
,
*NL*
you
will
read
in
the
next
chapter
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter

XII
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mortgager
and
Mortgagee
differ
the
one
from
the
other
,
not
more
in
*NL*
length
of
purse
,
than
the
Jester
and
Jestee
do
,
in
that
of
memory
.
But
*NL*
in
this
the
comparison
between
them
runs
,
as
the
scholiasts
call
it
,
*NL*
upon
all-four
;
which
,
by
the
bye
,
is
upon
one
or
two
legs
more
than
some
*NL*
of
the
best
of
Homer
's
can
pretend
to
;
--
namely
,
That
the
one
raises
a
*NL*
sum
,
and
the
other
a
laugh
at
your
expence
,
and
thinks
no
more
about
*NL*
it
.
Interest
,
however
,
still
runs
on
in
both
cases
;
--
the
periodical
or
*NL*
accidental
payments
of
it
,
just
serving
to
keep
the
memory
of
the
affair
*NL*
alive
;
till
,
at
length
,
in
some
evil
hour
,
pop
comes
the
creditor
upon
*NL*
each
,
and
by
demanding
principal
upon
the
spot
,
together
with
full
*NL*
interest
to
the
very
day
,
makes
them
both
feel
the
full
extent
of
their
*NL*
obligations
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
reader
-LRB-
for
I
hate
your
ifs
-RRB-
has
a
thorough
knowledge
of
human
*NL*
nature
,
I
need
not
say
more
to
satisfy
him
,
that
my
Hero
could
not
go
*NL*
on
at
this
rate
without
some
slight
experience
of
these
incidental
*NL*
mementos
.
To
speak
the
truth
,
he
had
wantonly
involved
himself
in
a
*NL*
multitude
of
small
book-debts
of
this
stamp
,
which
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
Eugenius
's
frequent
advice
,
he
too
much
disregarded
;
thinking
,
that
*NL*
as
not
one
of
them
was
contracted
thro
'
any
malignancy
;
--
but
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
from
an
honesty
of
mind
,
and
a
mere
jocundity
of
humour
,
they
*NL*
would
all
of
them
be
cross
'd
out
in
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eugenius
would
never
admit
this
;
and
would
often
tell
him
,
that
one
day
*NL*
or
other
he
would
certainly
be
reckoned
with
;
and
he
would
often
add
,
*NL*
in
an
accent
of
sorrowful
apprehension
,
--
to
the
uttermost
mite
.
To
which
*NL*
Yorick
,
with
his
usual
carelessness
of
heart
,
would
as
often
answer
with
*NL*
a
pshaw
!
--
and
if
the
subject
was
started
in
the
fields
,
--
with
a
hop
,
*NL*
skip
,
and
a
jump
at
the
end
of
it
;
but
if
close
pent
up
in
the
social
*NL*
chimney-corner
,
where
the
culprit
was
barricado
'd
in
,
with
a
table
and
*NL*
a
couple
of
arm-chairs
,
and
could
not
so
readily
fly
off
in
a
*NL*
tangent
,
--
Eugenius
would
then
go
on
with
his
lecture
upon
discretion
in
*NL*
words
to
this
purpose
,
though
somewhat
better
put
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Trust
me
,
dear
Yorick
,
this
unwary
pleasantry
of
thine
will
sooner
or
*NL*
later
bring
thee
into
scrapes
and
difficulties
,
which
no
after-wit
can
*NL*
extricate
thee
out
of
.
--
In
these
sallies
,
too
oft
,
I
see
,
it
happens
,
*NL*
that
a
person
laughed
at
,
considers
himself
in
the
light
of
a
person
*NL*
injured
,
with
all
the
rights
of
such
a
situation
belonging
to
him
;
and
*NL*
when
thou
viewest
him
in
that
light
too
,
and
reckons
up
his
friends
,
*NL*
his
family
,
his
kindred
and
allies
,
--
and
musters
up
with
them
the
many
*NL*
recruits
which
will
list
under
him
from
a
sense
of
common
danger
;
--
't
is
*NL*
no
extravagant
arithmetic
to
say
,
that
for
every
ten
jokes
,
--
thou
hast
*NL*
got
an
hundred
enemies
;
and
till
thou
hast
gone
on
,
and
raised
a
swarm
*NL*
of
wasps
about
thine
ears
,
and
art
half
stung
to
death
by
them
,
thou
*NL*
wilt
never
be
convinced
it
is
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
suspect
it
in
the
man
whom
I
esteem
,
that
there
is
the
least
*NL*
spur
from
spleen
or
malevolence
of
intent
in
these
sallies
--
I
believe
*NL*
and
know
them
to
be
truly
honest
and
sportive
:
--
But
consider
,
my
dear
*NL*
lad
,
that
fools
can
not
distinguish
this
,
--
and
that
knaves
will
not
:
and
*NL*
thou
knowest
not
what
it
is
,
either
to
provoke
the
one
,
or
to
make
merry
*NL*
with
the
other
:
--
whenever
they
associate
for
mutual
defence
,
depend
upon
*NL*
it
,
they
will
carry
on
the
war
in
such
a
manner
against
thee
,
my
dear
*NL*
friend
,
as
to
make
thee
heartily
sick
of
it
,
and
of
thy
life
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Revenge
from
some
baneful
corner
shall
level
a
tale
of
dishonour
at
*NL*
thee
,
which
no
innocence
of
heart
or
integrity
of
conduct
shall
set
*NL*
right
.
--
The
fortunes
of
thy
house
shall
totter
,
--
thy
character
,
which
*NL*
led
the
way
to
them
,
shall
bleed
on
every
side
of
it
,
--
thy
faith
*NL*
questioned
,
--
thy
works
belied
,
--
thy
wit
forgotten
,
--
thy
learning
*NL*
trampled
on
.
To
wind
up
the
last
scene
of
thy
tragedy
,
Cruelty
and
*NL*
Cowardice
,
twin
ruffians
,
hired
and
set
on
by
Malice
in
the
dark
,
shall
*NL*
strike
together
at
all
thy
infirmities
and
mistakes
:
--
The
best
of
us
,
*NL*
my
dear
lad
,
lie
open
there
,
--
and
trust
me
,
--
trust
me
,
Yorick
,
when
to
*NL*
gratify
a
private
appetite
,
it
is
once
resolved
upon
,
that
an
innocent
*NL*
and
an
helpless
creature
shall
be
sacrificed
,
't
is
an
easy
matter
to
*NL*
pick
up
sticks
enough
from
any
thicket
where
it
has
strayed
,
to
make
a
*NL*
fire
to
offer
it
up
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yorick
scarce
ever
heard
this
sad
vaticination
of
his
destiny
read
over
*NL*
to
him
,
but
with
a
tear
stealing
from
his
eye
,
and
a
promissory
look
*NL*
attending
it
,
that
he
was
resolved
,
for
the
time
to
come
,
to
ride
his
*NL*
tit
with
more
sobriety
.
--
But
,
alas
,
too
late
!
--
a
grand
confederacy
*NL*
with
...
and
...
at
the
head
of
it
,
was
formed
before
the
first
prediction
*NL*
of
it
.
--
The
whole
plan
of
the
attack
,
just
as
Eugenius
had
foreboded
,
*NL*
was
put
in
execution
all
at
once
,
--
with
so
little
mercy
on
the
side
of
*NL*
the
allies
,
--
and
so
little
suspicion
in
Yorick
,
of
what
was
carrying
*NL*
on
against
him
,
--
that
when
he
thought
,
good
easy
man
!
full
surely
*NL*
preferment
was
o'ripening
,
--
they
had
smote
his
root
,
and
then
he
fell
,
*NL*
as
many
a
worthy
man
had
fallen
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yorick
,
however
,
fought
it
out
with
all
imaginable
gallantry
for
some
*NL*
time
;
till
,
overpowered
by
numbers
,
and
worn
out
at
length
by
the
*NL*
calamities
of
the
war
,
--
but
more
so
,
by
the
ungenerous
manner
in
which
*NL*
it
was
carried
on
,
--
he
threw
down
the
sword
;
and
though
he
kept
up
*NL*
his
spirits
in
appearance
to
the
last
,
he
died
,
nevertheless
,
as
was
*NL*
generally
thought
,
quite
broken-hearted
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
inclined
Eugenius
to
the
same
opinion
was
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
hours
before
Yorick
breathed
his
last
,
Eugenius
stept
in
with
an
*NL*
intent
to
take
his
last
sight
and
last
farewell
of
him
.
Upon
his
drawing
*NL*
Yorick
's
curtain
,
and
asking
how
he
felt
himself
,
Yorick
looking
up
in
*NL*
his
face
took
hold
of
his
hand
,
--
and
after
thanking
him
for
the
many
*NL*
tokens
of
his
friendship
to
him
,
for
which
,
he
said
,
if
it
was
their
*NL*
fate
to
meet
hereafter
,
--
he
would
thank
him
again
and
again
,
--
he
told
*NL*
him
,
he
was
within
a
few
hours
of
giving
his
enemies
the
slip
for
*NL*
ever
.
--
I
hope
not
,
answered
Eugenius
,
with
tears
trickling
down
his
*NL*
cheeks
,
and
with
the
tenderest
tone
that
ever
man
spoke
.
--
I
hope
not
,
*NL*
Yorick
,
said
he
.
--
Yorick
replied
,
with
a
look
up
,
and
a
gentle
squeeze
*NL*
of
Eugenius
's
hand
,
and
that
was
all
,
--
but
it
cut
Eugenius
to
his
*NL*
heart
.
--
Come
,
--
come
,
Yorick
,
quoth
Eugenius
,
wiping
his
eyes
,
and
*NL*
summoning
up
the
man
within
him
,
--
my
dear
lad
,
be
comforted
,
--
let
not
*NL*
all
thy
spirits
and
fortitude
forsake
thee
at
this
crisis
when
thou
most
*NL*
wants
them
;
--
who
knows
what
resources
are
in
store
,
and
what
the
power
*NL*
of
God
may
yet
do
for
thee
!
--
Yorick
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
*NL*
gently
shook
his
head
;
--
For
my
part
,
continued
Eugenius
,
crying
bitterly
*NL*
as
he
uttered
the
words
,
--
I
declare
I
know
not
,
Yorick
,
how
to
part
with
*NL*
thee
,
and
would
gladly
flatter
my
hopes
,
added
Eugenius
,
chearing
up
*NL*
his
voice
,
that
there
is
still
enough
left
of
thee
to
make
a
bishop
,
*NL*
and
that
I
may
live
to
see
it
.
--
I
beseech
thee
,
Eugenius
,
quoth
Yorick
,
*NL*
taking
off
his
night-cap
as
well
as
he
could
with
his
left
hand
,
--
his
*NL*
right
being
still
grasped
close
in
that
of
Eugenius
,
--
I
beseech
thee
to
*NL*
take
a
view
of
my
head
.
--
I
see
nothing
that
ails
it
,
replied
Eugenius
.
*NL*
Then
,
alas
!
my
friend
,
said
Yorick
,
let
me
tell
you
,
that
't
is
so
*NL*
bruised
and
mis-shapened
with
the
blows
which
...
and
...
,
and
some
others
*NL*
have
so
unhandsomely
given
me
in
the
dark
,
that
I
might
say
with
Sancho
*NL*
Panca
,
that
should
I
recover
,
and
`
Mitres
thereupon
be
suffered
to
*NL*
rain
down
from
heaven
as
thick
as
hail
,
not
one
of
them
would
fit
*NL*
it
.
'
--
Yorick
's
last
breath
was
hanging
upon
his
trembling
lips
ready
to
*NL*
depart
as
he
uttered
this
:
--
yet
still
it
was
uttered
with
something
of
*NL*
a
Cervantick
tone
;
--
and
as
he
spoke
it
,
Eugenius
could
perceive
a
stream
*NL*
of
lambent
fire
lighted
up
for
a
moment
in
his
eyes
;
--
faint
picture
of
*NL*
those
flashes
of
his
spirit
,
which
-LRB-
as
Shakespeare
said
of
his
ancestor
-RRB-
*NL*
were
wont
to
set
the
table
in
a
roar
!
*NL*
*NL*
Eugenius
was
convinced
from
this
,
that
the
heart
of
his
friend
was
*NL*
broke
:
he
squeezed
his
hand
,
--
and
then
walked
softly
out
of
the
room
,
*NL*
weeping
as
he
walked
.
Yorick
followed
Eugenius
with
his
eyes
to
the
*NL*
door
,
--
he
then
closed
them
,
and
never
opened
them
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lies
buried
in
the
corner
of
his
church-yard
,
in
the
parish
of
...
,
*NL*
under
a
plain
marble
slab
,
which
his
friend
Eugenius
,
by
leave
of
his
*NL*
executors
,
laid
upon
his
grave
,
with
no
more
than
these
three
words
of
*NL*
inscription
,
serving
both
for
his
epitaph
and
elegy
.
Alas
,
poor
Yorick
!
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
times
a
day
has
Yorick
's
ghost
the
consolation
to
hear
his
*NL*
monumental
inscription
read
over
with
such
a
variety
of
plaintive
tones
,
*NL*
as
denote
a
general
pity
and

It
is
so
long
since
the
reader
of
this
rhapsodical
work
has
been
parted
*NL*
from
the
midwife
,
that
it
is
high
time
to
mention
her
again
to
him
,
*NL*
merely
to
put
him
in
mind
that
there
is
such
a
body
still
in
the
world
,
*NL*
and
whom
,
upon
the
best
judgment
I
can
form
upon
my
own
plan
at
present
,
*NL*
I
am
going
to
introduce
to
him
for
good
and
all
:
But
as
fresh
matter
may
*NL*
be
started
,
and
much
unexpected
business
fall
out
betwixt
the
reader
and
*NL*
myself
,
which
may
require
immediate
dispatch
;
--
't
was
right
to
take
care
*NL*
that
the
poor
woman
should
not
be
lost
in
the
mean
time
;
--
because
when
*NL*
she
is
wanted
,
we
can
no
way
do
without
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
I
told
you
that
this
good
woman
was
a
person
of
no
small
note
*NL*
and
consequence
throughout
our
whole
village
and
township
;
--
that
her
*NL*
fame
had
spread
itself
to
the
very
out-edge
and
circumference
of
that
*NL*
circle
of
importance
,
of
which
kind
every
soul
living
,
whether
he
has
a
*NL*
shirt
to
his
back
or
no
,
--
has
one
surrounding
him
;
--
which
said
circle
,
*NL*
by
the
way
,
whenever
't
is
said
that
such
a
one
is
of
great
weight
and
*NL*
importance
in
the
world
,
--
I
desire
may
be
enlarged
or
contracted
in
*NL*
your
worship
's
fancy
,
in
a
compound
ratio
of
the
station
,
profession
,
*NL*
knowledge
,
abilities
,
height
and
depth
-LRB-
measuring
both
ways
-RRB-
of
the
*NL*
personage
brought
before
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
present
case
,
if
I
remember
,
I
fixed
it
about
four
or
five
miles
,
*NL*
which
not
only
comprehended
the
whole
parish
,
but
extended
itself
to
two
*NL*
or
three
of
the
adjacent
hamlets
in
the
skirts
of
the
next
parish
;
which
*NL*
made
a
considerable
thing
of
it
.
I
must
add
,
That
she
was
,
moreover
,
*NL*
very
well
looked
on
at
one
large
grange-house
,
and
some
other
odd
houses
*NL*
and
farms
within
two
or
three
miles
,
as
I
said
,
from
the
smoke
of
her
*NL*
own
chimney
:
--
But
I
must
here
,
once
for
all
,
inform
you
,
that
all
this
*NL*
will
be
more
exactly
delineated
and
explain
'd
in
a
map
,
now
in
the
hands
*NL*
of
the
engraver
,
which
,
with
many
other
pieces
and
developements
of
this
*NL*
work
,
will
be
added
to
the
end
of
the
twentieth
volume
,
--
not
to
*NL*
swell
the
work
,
--
I
detest
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
;
--
but
by
way
of
*NL*
commentary
,
scholium
,
illustration
,
and
key
to
such
passages
,
incidents
,
*NL*
or
inuendos
as
shall
be
thought
to
be
either
of
private
interpretation
,
*NL*
or
of
dark
or
doubtful
meaning
,
after
my
life
and
my
opinions
shall
have
*NL*
been
read
over
-LRB-
now
do
n't
forget
the
meaning
of
the
word
-RRB-
by
all
*NL*
the
world
;
--
which
,
betwixt
you
and
me
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
*NL*
gentlemen-reviewers
in
Great
Britain
,
and
of
all
that
their
worships
*NL*
shall
undertake
to
write
or
say
to
the
contrary
,
--
I
am
determined
shall
*NL*
be
the
case
.
--
I
need
not
tell
your
worship
,
that
all
this
is
spoke
in
*NL*
confidence

Upon
looking
into
my
mother
's
marriage
settlement
,
in
order
to
satisfy
*NL*
myself
and
reader
in
a
point
necessary
to
be
cleared
up
,
before
we
could
*NL*
proceed
any
farther
in
this
history
;
--
I
had
the
good
fortune
to
pop
*NL*
upon
the
very
thing
I
wanted
before
I
had
read
a
day
and
a
half
straight
*NL*
forwards
,
--
it
might
have
taken
me
up
a
month
;
--
which
shews
plainly
,
that
*NL*
when
a
man
sits
down
to
write
a
history
,
--
tho
'
it
be
but
the
history
of
*NL*
Jack
Hickathrift
or
Tom
Thumb
,
he
knows
no
more
than
his
heels
what
*NL*
lets
and
confounded
hindrances
he
is
to
meet
with
in
his
way
,
--
or
what
*NL*
a
dance
he
may
be
led
,
by
one
excursion
or
another
,
before
all
is
over
.
*NL*
Could
a
historiographer
drive
on
his
history
,
as
a
muleteer
drives
on
*NL*
his
mule
,
--
straight
forward
;
--
for
instance
,
from
Rome
all
the
way
to
*NL*
Loretto
,
without
ever
once
turning
his
head
aside
,
either
to
the
right
*NL*
hand
or
to
the
left
,
--
he
might
venture
to
foretell
you
to
an
hour
when
*NL*
he
should
get
to
his
journey
's
end
;
--
but
the
thing
is
,
morally
speaking
,
*NL*
impossible
:
For
,
if
he
is
a
man
of
the
least
spirit
,
he
will
have
fifty
*NL*
deviations
from
a
straight
line
to
make
with
this
or
that
party
as
he
*NL*
goes
along
,
which
he
can
no
ways
avoid
.
He
will
have
views
and
prospects
*NL*
to
himself
perpetually
soliciting
his
eye
,
which
he
can
no
more
help
*NL*
standing
still
to
look
at
than
he
can
fly
;
he
will
moreover
have
various
*NL*
*NL*
Accounts
to
reconcile
:
*NL*
Anecdotes
to
pick
up
:
*NL*
Inscriptions
to
make
out
:
*NL*
Stories
to
weave
in
:
*NL*
Traditions
to
sift
:
*NL*
Personages
to
call
upon
:
*NL*
Panegyricks
to
paste
up
at
this
door
;
*NL*
*NL*
Pasquinades
at
that
:
--
All
which
both
the
man
and
his
mule
are
quite
*NL*
exempt
from
.
To
sum
up
all
;
there
are
archives
at
every
stage
to
be
*NL*
look
'd
into
,
and
rolls
,
records
,
documents
,
and
endless
genealogies
,
*NL*
which
justice
ever
and
anon
calls
him
back
to
stay
the
reading
of
:
--
In
*NL*
short
there
is
no
end
of
it
;
--
for
my
own
part
,
I
declare
I
have
been
at
*NL*
it
these
six
weeks
,
making
all
the
speed
I
possibly
could
,
--
and
am
not
*NL*
yet
born
:
--
I
have
just
been
able
,
and
that
's
all
,
to
tell
you
when
it
*NL*
happen
'd
,
but
not
how
;
--
so
that
you
see
the
thing
is
yet
far
from
being
*NL*
accomplished
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
unforeseen
stoppages
,
which
I
own
I
had
no
conception
of
when
I
*NL*
first
set
out
;
--
but
which
,
I
am
convinced
now
,
will
rather
increase
than
*NL*
diminish
as
I
advance
,
--
have
struck
out
a
hint
which
I
am
resolved
to
*NL*
follow
;
--
and
that
is
,
--
not
to
be
in
a
hurry
;
--
but
to
go
on
leisurely
,
*NL*
writing
and
publishing
two
volumes
of
my
life
every
year
;
--
which
,
if
I
*NL*
am
suffered
to
go
on
quietly
,
and
can
make
a
tolerable
bargain
with
my
*NL*
bookseller
,
I
shall
continue
to
do
as
long
as
I
live

The

I
told

*NL*
I

now

In
three
words
,

`
My
mother
was
to
lay
in
-LRB-
if
she
*NL*
chose
it
-RRB-
in
London
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
order
to
put
a
stop
to
the
practice
of
any
unfair
play
on
*NL*
the
part
of
my
mother
,
which
a
marriage-article
of
this
nature
too
*NL*
manifestly
opened
a
door
to
,
and
which
indeed
had
never
been
thought
of
*NL*
at
all
,
but
for
my
uncle
Toby
Shandy
;
--
a
clause
was
added
in
security
of
*NL*
my
father
which
was
this
:
--
`
That
in
case
my
mother
hereafter
should
,
at
*NL*
any
time
,
put
my
father
to
the
trouble
and
expence
of
a
London
journey
,
*NL*
upon
false
cries
and
tokens
;
--
that
for
every
such
instance
,
she
should
*NL*
forfeit
all
the
right
and
title
which
the
covenant
gave
her
to
the
next
*NL*
turn
;
--
but
to
no
more
,
--
and
so
on
,
toties
quoties
,
in
as
effectual
a
*NL*
manner
,
as
if
such
a
covenant
betwixt
them
had
not
been
made
.
'
--
This
,
by
*NL*
the
way
,
was
no
more
than
what
was
reasonable
;
--
and
yet
,
as
reasonable
*NL*
as
it
was
,
I
have
ever
thought
it
hard
that
the
whole
weight
of
the
*NL*
article
should
have
fallen
entirely
,
as
it
did
,
upon
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
was
begot
and
born
to
misfortunes
;
--
for
my
poor
mother
,
whether
*NL*
it
was
wind
or
water
--
or
a
compound
of
both
,
--
or
neither
;
--
or
whether
it
*NL*
was
simply
the
mere
swell
of
imagination
and
fancy
in
her
;
--
or
how
far
*NL*
a
strong
wish
and
desire
to
have
it
so
,
might
mislead
her
judgment
;
--
in
*NL*
short
,
whether
she
was
deceived
or
deceiving
in
this
matter
,
it
no
*NL*
way
becomes
me
to
decide
.
The
fact
was
this
,
That
in
the
latter
end
of
*NL*
September
1717
,
which
was
the
year
before
I
was
born
,
my
mother
having
*NL*
carried
my
father
up
to
town
much
against
the
grain
,
--
he
peremptorily
*NL*
insisted
upon
the
clause
;
--
so
that
I
was
doom
'd
,
by
marriage-articles
,
*NL*
to
have
my
nose
squeez
'd
as
flat
to
my
face
,
as
if
the
destinies
had
*NL*
actually
spun
me
without
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
this
event
came
about
,
--
and
what
a
train
of
vexatious
*NL*
disappointments
,
in
one
stage
or
other
of
my
life
,
have
pursued
me
from
*NL*
the
mere
loss
,
or
rather
compression
,
of
this
one
single
member
,

shall
*NL*
be
laid

*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
as
any
body
may
naturally
imagine
,
came
down
with
my
mother
*NL*
into
the
country
,
in
but
a
pettish
kind
of
a
humour
.
The
first
twenty
*NL*
or
five-and-twenty
miles
he
did
nothing
in
the
world
but
fret
and
teaze
*NL*
himself
,
and
indeed
my
mother
too
,
about
the
cursed
expence
,
which
he
*NL*
said
might
every
shilling
of
it
have
been
saved
;
--
then
what
vexed
him
*NL*
more
than
every
thing
else
was
,
the
provoking
time
of
the
year
,
--
which
,
*NL*
as
I
told
you
,
was
towards
the
end
of
September
,
when
his
wall-fruit
and
*NL*
green
gages
especially
,
in
which
he
was
very
curious
,
were
just
ready
*NL*
for
pulling
:
--
`
Had
he
been
whistled
up
to
London
,
upon
a
Tom
Fool
's
*NL*
errand
,
in
any
other
month
of
the
whole
year
,
he
should
not
have
said
*NL*
three
words
about
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
next
two
whole
stages
,
no
subject
would
go
down
,
but
the
heavy
*NL*
blow
he
had
sustain
'd
from
the
loss
of
a
son
,
whom
it
seems
he
had
fully
*NL*
reckon
'd
upon
in
his
mind
,
and
register
'd
down
in
his
pocket-book
,
as
*NL*
a
second
staff
for
his
old
age
,
in
case
Bobby
should
fail
him
.
`
The
*NL*
disappointment
of
this
,
he
said
,
was
ten
times
more
to
a
wise
man
,
than
*NL*
all
the
money
which
the
journey
,
&
c.
had
cost
him
,
put
together
,
--
rot
*NL*
the
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
,
--
he
did
not
mind
it
a
rush
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
From
Stilton
,
all
the
way
to
Grantham
,
nothing
in
the
whole
affair
*NL*
provoked
him
so
much
as
the
condolences
of
his
friends
,
and
the
foolish
*NL*
figure
they
should
both
make
at
church
,
the
first
Sunday
;
--
of
which
,
in
*NL*
the
satirical
vehemence
of
his
wit
,
now
sharpen
'd
a
little
by
vexation
,
*NL*
he
would
give
so
many
humorous
and
provoking
descriptions
,
--
and
place
*NL*
his
rib
and
self
in
so
many
tormenting
lights
and
attitudes
in
the
face
*NL*
of
the
whole
congregation
;
--
that
my
mother
declared
,
these
two
stages
*NL*
were
so
truly
tragi-comical
,
that
she
did
nothing
but
laugh
and
cry
in
a
*NL*
breath
,
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
them
all
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Grantham
,
till
they
had
cross
'd
the
Trent
,
my
father
was
out
of
all
*NL*
kind
of
patience
at
the
vile
trick
and
imposition
which
he
fancied
my
*NL*
mother
had
put
upon
him
in
this
affair
--
`
Certainly
,
'
he
would
say
*NL*
to
himself
,
over
and
over
again
,
`
the
woman
could
not
be
deceived
*NL*
herself
--
if
she
could
,
--
what
weakness
!
'
--
tormenting
word
!
--
which
led
his
*NL*
imagination
a
thorny
dance
,
and
,
before
all
was
over
,
play
'd
the
duce
*NL*
and
all
with
him
;
--
for
sure
as
ever
the
word
weakness
was
uttered
,
and
*NL*
struck
full
upon
his
brain
--
so
sure
it
set
him
upon
running
divisions
*NL*
upon
how
many
kinds
of
weaknesses
there
were
;
--
that
there
was
such
a
*NL*
thing
as
weakness
of
the
body
,
--
as
well
as
weakness
of
the
mind
,
--
and
*NL*
then
he
would
do
nothing
but
syllogize
within
himself
for
a
stage
or
two
*NL*
together
,
How
far
the
cause
of
all
these
vexations
might
,
or
might
not
,
*NL*
have
arisen
out
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
he
had
so
many
little
subjects
of
disquietude
springing
out
of
*NL*
this
one
affair
,
all
fretting
successively
in
his
mind
as
they
rose
up
*NL*
in
it
,
that
my
mother
,
whatever
was
her
journey
up
,
had
but
an
uneasy
*NL*
journey
of
it
down
.
--
In
a
word
,
as
she
complained
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
he
*NL*
would
have
tired
out
the
patience
of
any
flesh
alive
.

Though
my
father
travelled
homewards
,
as
I
told
you
,
in
none
of
the
*NL*
best
of
moods
,
--
pshawing
and
pishing
all
the
way
down
,
--
yet
he
had
*NL*
the
complaisance
to
keep
the
worst
part
of
the
story
still
to
*NL*
himself
;
--
which
was
the
resolution
he
had
taken
of
doing
himself
*NL*
the
justice
,
which
my
uncle
Toby
's
clause
in
the
marriage-settlement
*NL*
empowered
him
;
nor
was
it
till
the
very
night
in
which
I
was
begot
,
*NL*
which
was
thirteen
months
after
,
that
she
had
the
least
intimation
of
*NL*
his
design
:
when
my
father
,
happening
,
as
you
remember
,
to
be
a
little
*NL*
chagrin
'd
and
out
of
temper
,
--
took
occasion
as
they
lay
chatting
gravely
*NL*
in
bed
afterwards
,
talking
over
what
was
to
come
,
--
to
let
her
know
that
*NL*
she
must
accommodate
herself
as
well
as
she
could
to
the
bargain
made
*NL*
between
them
in
their
marriage-deeds
;
which
was
to
lye-in
of
her
next
*NL*
child
in
the
country
,
to
balance
the
last
year
's
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
was
a
gentleman
of
many
virtues
,
--
but
he
had
a
strong
spice
of
*NL*
that
in
his
temper
,
which
might
,
or
might
not
,
add
to
the
number
.
--
'T
is
*NL*
known
by
the
name
of
perseverance
in
a
good
cause
,
--
and
of
obstinacy
in
*NL*
a
bad
one
:
Of
this
my
mother
had
so
much
knowledge
,
that
she
knew
't
was
*NL*
to
no
purpose
to
make
any
remonstrance
,
--
so
she
e
`
en
resolved
to
sit
*NL*
down
quietly
,
and
make
the
most
of
it
.

As
the
point
was
that
night
agreed
,
or
rather
determined
,
that
my
mother
*NL*
should
lye-in
of
me
in
the
country
,
she
took
her
measures
accordingly
;
*NL*
for
which
purpose
,
when
she
was
three
days
,
or
thereabouts
,
gone
with
*NL*
child
,
she
began
to
cast
her
eyes
upon
the
midwife
,
whom
you
have
so
*NL*
often
heard
me
mention
;
and
before
the
week
was
well
got
round
,
as
*NL*
the
famous
Dr.
Manningham
was
not
to
be
had
,
she
had
come
to
a
final
*NL*
determination
in
her
mind
,
--
notwithstanding
there
was
a
scientific
*NL*
operator
within
so
near
a
call
as
eight
miles
of
us
,
and
who
,
moreover
,
*NL*
had
expressly
wrote
a
five
shillings
book
upon
the
subject
of
midwifery
,
*NL*
in
which
he
had
exposed
,
not
only
the
blunders
of
the
sisterhood
*NL*
itself
,
--
but
had
likewise
super-added
many
curious
improvements
for
the
*NL*
quicker
extraction
of
the
foetus
in
cross
births
,
and
some
other
cases
*NL*
of
danger
,
which
belay
us
in
getting
into
the
world
;
notwithstanding
all
*NL*
this
,
my
mother
,
I
say
,
was
absolutely
determined
to
trust
her
life
,
and
*NL*
mine
with
it
,
into
no
soul
's
hand
but
this
old
woman
's
only
.
--
Now
this
*NL*
I
like
;
--
when
we
can
not
get
at
the
very
thing
we
wish
--
never
to
take
*NL*
up
with
the
next
best
in
degree
to
it
:
--
no
;
that
's
pitiful
beyond
*NL*
description
;
--
it
is
no
more
than
a
week
from
this
very
day
,
in
which
*NL*
I
am
now
writing
this
book
for
the
edification
of
the
world
;
--
which
is
*NL*
March
9
,
1759
,
--
that
my
dear
,
dear
Jenny
,
observing
I
looked
a
little
*NL*
grave
,
as
she
stood
cheapening
a
silk
of
five-and-twenty
shillings
*NL*
a
yard
,
--
told
the
mercer
,
she
was
sorry
she
had
given
him
so
much
*NL*
trouble
;
--
and
immediately
went
and
bought
herself
a
yard-wide
stuff
of
*NL*
ten-pence
a
yard
.
--
'T
is
the
duplication
of
one
and
the
same
greatness
*NL*
of
soul
;
only
what
lessened
the
honour
of
it
,
somewhat
,
in
my
mother
's
*NL*
case
,
was
,
that
she
could
not
heroine
it
into
so
violent
and
hazardous
*NL*
an
extreme
,
as
one
in
her
situation
might
have
wished
,
because
the
old
*NL*
midwife
had
really
some
little
claim
to
be
depended
upon
,
--
as
much
,
at
*NL*
least
,
as
success
could
give
her
;
having
,
in
the
course
of
her
practice
*NL*
of
near
twenty
years
in
the
parish
,
brought
every
mother
's
son
of
them
*NL*
into
the
world
without
any
one
slip
or
accident
which
could
fairly
be
*NL*
laid
to
her
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
facts
,
tho
'
they
had
their
weight
,
yet
did
not
altogether
satisfy
*NL*
some
few
scruples
and
uneasinesses
which
hung
upon
my
father
's
spirits
*NL*
in
relation
to
this
choice
.
--
To
say
nothing
of
the
natural
workings
*NL*
of
humanity
and
justice
--
or
of
the
yearnings
of
parental
and
connubial
*NL*
love
,
all
which
prompted
him
to
leave
as
little
to
hazard
as
possible
in
*NL*
a
case
of
this
kind
;
--
he
felt
himself
concerned
in
a
particular
manner
,
*NL*
that
all
should
go
right
in
the
present
case
;
--
from
the
accumulated
*NL*
sorrow
he
lay
open
to
,
should
any
evil
betide
his
wife
and
child
in
*NL*
lying-in
at
Shandy-Hall
.
--
He
knew
the
world
judged
by
events
,
and
would
*NL*
add
to
his
afflictions
in
such
a
misfortune
,
by
loading
him
with
the
*NL*
whole
blame
of
it
.
--
`
Alas
o'day
;
--
had
Mrs.
Shandy
,
poor
gentlewoman
!
*NL*
had
but
her
wish
in
going
up
to
town
just
to
lye-in
and
come
down
*NL*
again
;
--
which
they
say
,
she
begged
and
prayed
for
upon
her
bare
*NL*
knees
,
--
and
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
considering
the
fortune
which
Mr.
*NL*
Shandy
got
with
her
,
--
was
no
such
mighty
matter
to
have
complied
with
,
*NL*
the
lady
and
her
babe
might
both
of
them
have
been
alive
at
this
hour
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
exclamation
,
my
father
knew
,
was
unanswerable
;
--
and
yet
,
it
was
not
*NL*
merely
to
shelter
himself
,
--
nor
was
it
altogether
for
the
care
of
*NL*
his
offspring
and
wife
that
he
seemed
so
extremely
anxious
about
this
*NL*
point
;
--
my
father
had
extensive
views
of
things
,
--
and
stood
moreover
,
as
*NL*
he
thought
,
deeply
concerned
in
it
for
the
publick
good
,
from
the
dread
*NL*
he
entertained
of
the
bad
uses
an
ill-fated
instance
might
be
put
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
sensible
that
all
political
writers
upon
the
subject
had
*NL*
unanimously
agreed
and
lamented
,
from
the
beginning
of
Queen
Elizabeth
's
*NL*
reign
down
to
his
own
time
,
that
the
current
of
men
and
money
towards
*NL*
the
metropolis
,
upon
one
frivolous
errand
or
another
,
--
set
in
so
*NL*
strong
,
--
as
to
become
dangerous
to
our
civil
rights
,
--
though
,
by
the
*NL*
bye
,

a
current
was
not
the
image
he
took
most
delight
in
,
--
a
distemper
*NL*
was
here
his
favourite
metaphor
,
and
he
would
run
it
down
into
a
*NL*
perfect
allegory
,
by
maintaining
it
was
identically
the
same
in
the
body
*NL*
national
as
in
the
body
natural
,
where
the
blood
and
spirits
were
*NL*
driven
up
into
the
head
faster
than
they
could
find
their
ways
down
;
--
a
*NL*
stoppage
of
circulation
must
ensue
,
which
was
death
in
both
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
little
danger
,
he
would
say
,
of
losing
our
liberties
by
*NL*
French
politicks
or
French
invasions
;
--
nor
was
he
so
much
in
pain
of
a
*NL*
consumption
from
the
mass
of
corrupted
matter
and
ulcerated
humours
in
*NL*
our
constitution
,
which
he
hoped
was
not
so
bad
as
it
was
imagined
;
--
but
*NL*
he
verily
feared
,
that
in
some
violent
push
,
we
should
go
off
,
all
at
*NL*
once
,
in
a
state-apoplexy
;
--
and
then
he
would
say
,
The
Lord
have
mercy
*NL*
upon
us
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
was
never
able
to
give
the
history
of
this
distemper
,
--
without
*NL*
the
remedy
along
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Was
I
an
absolute
prince
,
'
he
would
say
,
pulling
up
his
breeches
with
*NL*
both
his
hands
,
as
he
rose
from
his
arm-chair
,
'
I
would
appoint
able
*NL*
judges
,
at
every
avenue
of
my
metropolis
,
who
should
take
cognizance
of
*NL*
every
fool
's
business
who
came
there
;
--
and
if
,
upon
a
fair
and
candid
*NL*
hearing
,
it
appeared
not
of
weight
sufficient
to
leave
his
own
home
,
and
*NL*
come
up
,
bag
and
baggage
,
with
his
wife
and
children
,
farmer
's
sons
,
*NL*
&
c.
&
c.
at
his
backside
,
they
should
be
all
sent
back
,
from
constable
*NL*
to
constable
,
like
vagrants
as
they
were
,
to
the
place
of
their
legal
*NL*
settlements
.
By
this
means
I
shall
take
care
,
that
my
metropolis
*NL*
totter
'd
not
thro
'
its
own
weight
;
--
that
the
head
be
no
longer
too
big
*NL*
for
the
body
;
--
that
the
extremes
,
now
wasted
and
pinn
'd
in
,
be
restored
*NL*
to
their
due
share
of
nourishment
,
and
regain
with
it
their
natural
*NL*
strength
and
beauty
:
--
I
would
effectually
provide
,
That
the
meadows
and
*NL*
corn
fields
of
my
dominions
,
should
laugh
and
sing
;
--
that
good
chear
and
*NL*
hospitality
flourish
once
more
;
--
and
that
such
weight
and
influence
be
*NL*
put
thereby
into
the
hands
of
the
Squirality
of
my
kingdom
,
as
should
*NL*
counterpoise
what
I
perceive
my
Nobility
are
now
taking
from
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
are
there
so
few
palaces
and
gentlemen
's
seats
,
'
he
would
ask
,
*NL*
with
some
emotion
,
as
he
walked
across
the
room
,
`
throughout
so
many
*NL*
delicious
provinces
in
France
?
Whence
is
it
that
the
few
remaining
*NL*
Chateaus
amongst
them
are
so
dismantled
,
--
so
unfurnished
,
and
in
so
*NL*
ruinous
and
desolate
a
condition
?
--
Because
,
Sir
'
-LRB-
he
would
say
-RRB-
`
in
that
*NL*
kingdom
no
man
has
any
country-interest
to
support
;
--
the
little
interest
*NL*
of
any
kind
which
any
man
has
any
where
in
it
,
is
concentrated
in
the
*NL*
court
,
and
the
looks
of
the
Grand
Monarch
:
by
the
sunshine
of
whose
*NL*
countenance
,
or
the
clouds
which
pass
across
it
,
every
French
man
lives
*NL*
or
dies
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Another
political
reason
which
prompted
my
father
so
strongly
to
*NL*
guard
against
the
least
evil
accident
in
my
mother
's
lying-in
in
the
*NL*
country
,
--
was
,
That
any
such
instance
would
infallibly
throw
a
balance
*NL*
of
power
,
too
great
already
,
into
the
weaker
vessels
of
the
gentry
,
in
*NL*
his
own
,
or
higher
stations
;
--
which
,
with
the
many
other
usurped
rights
*NL*
which
that
part
of
the
constitution
was
hourly
establishing
,
--
would
,
in
*NL*
the
end
,
prove
fatal
to
the
monarchical
system
of
domestick
government
*NL*
established
in
the
first
creation
of
things
by
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
point
he
was
entirely
of
Sir
Robert
Filmer
's
opinion
,
That
the
*NL*
plans
and
institutions
of
the
greatest
monarchies
in
the
eastern
parts
*NL*
of
the
world
,
were
,
originally
,
all
stolen
from
that
admirable
pattern
*NL*
and
prototype
of
this
houshold
and
paternal
power
;
--
which
,
for
a
*NL*
century
,
he
said
,
and
more
,
had
gradually
been
degenerating
away
into
*NL*
a
mix
'd
government
;
--
the
form
of
which
,
however
desirable
in
great
*NL*
combinations
of
the
species
,
--
was
very
troublesome
in
small
ones
,
--
and
*NL*
seldom
produced
any
thing
,
that
he
saw
,
but
sorrow
and
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
these
reasons
,
private
and
publick
,
put
together
,
--
my
father
*NL*
was
for
having
the
man-midwife
by
all
means
,
--
my
mother
,
by
no
means
.
*NL*
My
father
begg
'd
and
intreated
,
she
would
for
once
recede
from
her
*NL*
prerogative
in
this
matter
,
and
suffer
him
to
choose
for
her
;
--
my
*NL*
mother
,
on
the
contrary
,
insisted
upon
her
privilege
in
this
matter
,
*NL*
to
choose
for
herself
,
--
and
have
no
mortal
's
help
but
the
old
*NL*
woman
's
.
--
What
could
my
father
do
?
He
was
almost
at
his
wit
's
*NL*
end
;
--
talked
it
over
with
her
in
all
moods
;
--
placed
his
arguments
in
*NL*
all
lights
;
--
argued
the
matter
with
her
like
a
christian
,
--
like
a
*NL*
heathen
,
--
like
a
husband
,
--
like
a
father
,
--
like
a
patriot
,
--
like
a
*NL*
man
:
--
My
mother
answered
every
thing
only
like
a
woman
;
which
was
a
*NL*
little
hard
upon
her
;
--
for
as
she
could
not
assume
and
fight
it
out
*NL*
behind
such
a
variety
of
characters
,
--
't
was
no
fair
match
:
--
't
was
seven
*NL*
to
one
.
--
What
could
my
mother
do
?
--
She
had
the
advantage
-LRB-
otherwise
*NL*
she
had
been
certainly
overpowered
-RRB-
of
a
small
reinforcement
of
chagrin
*NL*
personal
at
the
bottom
,
which
bore
her
up
,
and
enabled
her
to
dispute
*NL*
the
affair
with
my
father
with
so
equal
an
advantage
,
--
that
both
sides
*NL*
sung
Te
Deum
.
In
a
word
,
my
mother
was
to
have
the
old
woman
,
--
and
the
*NL*
operator
was
to
have
licence
to
drink
a
bottle
of
wine
with
my
father
*NL*
and
my
uncle
Toby
Shandy
in
the
back
parlour
,
--
for
which
he
was
to
be
*NL*
paid
five
guineas
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
beg
leave
,
before
I
finish
this
chapter
,
to
enter
a
caveat
in
the
*NL*
breast
of
my
fair
reader
;
--
and
it
is
this
,
--
Not
to
take
it
absolutely
*NL*
for
granted
,
from
an
unguarded
word
or
two
which
I
have
dropp
'd
in
*NL*
it
,
--
`
That
I
am
a
married
man
.
'
--
I
own
,
the
tender
appellation
of
*NL*
my
dear
,
dear
Jenny
,
--
with
some
other
strokes
of
conjugal
knowledge
,
*NL*
interspersed
here
and
there
,
might
,
naturally
enough
,
have
misled
*NL*
the
most
candid
judge
in
the
world
into
such
a
determination
against
*NL*
me
.
--
All
I
plead
for
,
in
this
case
,
Madam
,
is
strict
justice
,
and
that
*NL*
you
do
so
much
of
it
,
to
me
as
well
as
to
yourself
,
--
as
not
to
prejudge
,
*NL*
or
receive
such
an
impression
of
me
,
till
you
have
better
evidence
,
*NL*
than
,
I
am
positive
,
at
present
can
be
produced
against
me
.
--
Not
that
I
*NL*
can
be
so
vain
or
unreasonable
,
Madam
,
as
to
desire
you
should
therefore
*NL*
think
,
that
my
dear
,
dear
Jenny
is
my
kept
mistress
;
--
no
,
--
that
would
*NL*
be
flattering
my
character
in
the
other
extreme
,
and
giving
it
an
air
of
*NL*
freedom
,
which
,
perhaps
,
it
has
no
kind
of
right
to
.
All
I
contend
for
,
*NL*
is
the
utter
impossibility
,
for
some
volumes
,
that
you
,
or
the
most
*NL*
penetrating
spirit
upon
earth
,
should
know
how
this
matter
really
*NL*
stands
.
--
It
is
not
impossible
,
but
that
my
dear
,
dear
Jenny
!
tender
as
*NL*
the
appellation
is
,
may
be
my
child
.
--
Consider
,
--
I
was
born
in
the
*NL*
year
eighteen
.
--
Nor
is
there
any
thing
unnatural
or
extravagant
in
*NL*
the
supposition
,
that
my
dear
Jenny
may
be
my
friend
.
--
Friend
!
--
My
*NL*
friend
.
--
Surely
,
Madam
,
a
friendship
between
the
two
sexes
may
subsist
,
*NL*
and
be
supported
without
--
Fy
!
Mr.
Shandy
:
--
Without
any
thing
,
Madam
,
*NL*
but
that
tender
and
delicious
sentiment
which
ever
mixes
in
friendship
,
*NL*
where
there
is
a
difference
of
sex
.
Let
me
intreat
you
to
study
the
*NL*
pure
and
sentimental
parts
of
the
best
French
Romances
;
--
it
will
really
,
*NL*
Madam
,
astonish
you
to
see
with
what
a
variety
of
chaste
expressions
*NL*
this
delicious
sentiment
,
which
I
have
the
honour
to
speak
of
,
is
*NL*
dress
'd
out
.

Chapter

XIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
sooner
undertake
to
explain
the
hardest
problem
in
geometry
,
*NL*
than
pretend
to
account
for
it
,
that
a
gentleman
of
my
father
's
great
*NL*
good
sense
,
--
knowing
,
as
the
reader
must
have
observed
him
,
and
curious
*NL*
too
in
philosophy
,
--
wise
also
in
political
reasoning
,
--
and
in
polemical
*NL*
-LRB-
as
he
will
find
-RRB-
no
way
ignorant
,
--
could
be
capable
of
entertaining
a
*NL*
notion
in
his
head
,
so
out
of
the
common
track
,
--
that
I
fear
the
reader
,
*NL*
when
I
come
to
mention
it
to
him
,
if
he
is
the
least
of
a
cholerick
*NL*
temper
,
will
immediately
throw
the
book
by
;
if
mercurial
,
he
will
laugh
*NL*
most
heartily
at
it
;
--
and
if
he
is
of
a
grave
and
saturnine
cast
,
he
*NL*
will
,
at
first
sight
,
absolutely
condemn
as
fanciful
and
extravagant
;
*NL*
and
that
was
in
respect
to
the
choice
and
imposition
of
christian
names
,
*NL*
on
which
he
thought
a
great
deal
more
depended
than
what
superficial
*NL*
minds
were
capable
of
conceiving
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
opinion
,
in
this
matter
,
was
,
That
there
was
a
strange
kind
of
*NL*
magick
bias
,
which
good
or
bad
names
,
as
he
called
them
,
irresistibly
*NL*
impressed
upon
our
characters
and
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hero
of
Cervantes
argued
not
the
point
with
more
seriousness
,
--
nor
*NL*
had
he
more
faith
,
--
or
more
to
say
on
the
powers
of
necromancy
in
*NL*
dishonouring
his
deeds
,
--
or
on
Dulcinea
's
name
,
in
shedding
lustre
upon
*NL*
them
,
than
my
father
had
on
those
of
Trismegistus
or
Archimedes
,
on
*NL*
the
one
hand
--
or
of
Nyky
and
Simkin
on
the
other
.
How
many
Caesars
*NL*
and
Pompeys
,
he
would
say
,
by
mere
inspiration
of
the
names
,
have
been
*NL*
rendered
worthy
of
them
?
And
how
many
,
he
would
add
,
are
there
,
who
*NL*
might
have
done
exceeding
well
in
the
world
,
had
not
their
characters
*NL*
and
spirits
been
totally
depressed
and
Nicodemus
'd
into
nothing
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
see
plainly
,
Sir
,
by
your
looks
,
-LRB-
or
as
the
case
happened
-RRB-
my
father
*NL*
would
say
--
that
you
do
not
heartily
subscribe
to
this
opinion
of
*NL*
mine
,
--
which
,
to
those
,
he
would
add
,
who
have
not
carefully
sifted
it
*NL*
to
the
bottom
,
--
I
own
has
an
air
more
of
fancy
than
of
solid
reasoning
*NL*
in
it
;
--
and
yet
,
my
dear
Sir
,
if
I
may
presume
to
know
your
character
,
I
*NL*
am
morally
assured
,
I
should
hazard
little
in
stating
a
case
to
you
,
not
*NL*
as
a
party
in
the
dispute
,
--
but
as
a
judge
,
and
trusting
my
appeal
upon
*NL*
it
to
your
own
good
sense
and
candid
disquisition
in
this
matter
;
--
you
*NL*
are
a
person
free
from
as
many
narrow
prejudices
of
education
as
*NL*
most
men
;
--
and
,
if
I
may
presume
to
penetrate
farther
into
you
,
--
of
a
*NL*
liberality
of
genius
above
bearing
down
an
opinion
,
merely
because
it
*NL*
wants
friends
.
Your
son
,
--
your
dear
son
,
--
from
whose
sweet
and
open
*NL*
temper
you
have
so
much
to
expect
.
--
Your
Billy
,
Sir
!
--
would
you
,
for
*NL*
the
world
,
have
called
him
Judas
?
--
Would
you
,
my
dear
Sir
,
he
would
say
,
*NL*
laying
his
hand
upon
your
breast
,
with
the
genteelest
address
,
--
and
*NL*
in
that
soft
and
irresistible
piano
of
voice
,
which
the
nature
of
the
*NL*
argumentum
ad
hominem
absolutely
requires
,
--
Would
you
,
Sir
,
if
a
Jew
of
*NL*
a
godfather
had
proposed
the
name
for
your
child
,
and
offered
you
his
*NL*
purse
along
with
it
,
would
you
have
consented
to
such
a
desecration
of
*NL*
him
?
--
O
my
God
!
he
would
say
,
looking
up
,
if
I
know
your
temper
right
,
*NL*
Sir
,
--
you
are
incapable
of
it
;
--
you
would
have
trampled
upon
the
*NL*
offer
;
--
you
would
have
thrown
the
temptation
at
the
tempter
's
head
with
*NL*
abhorrence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
greatness
of
mind
in
this
action
,
which
I
admire
,
with
that
*NL*
generous
contempt
of
money
,
which
you
shew
me
in
the
whole
transaction
,
*NL*
is
really
noble
;
--
and
what
renders
it
more
so
,
is
the
principle
of
*NL*
it
;
--
the
workings
of
a
parent
's
love
upon
the
truth
and
conviction
*NL*
of
this
very
hypothesis
,
namely
,
That
was
your
son
called
Judas
,
--
the
*NL*
forbid
and
treacherous
idea
,
so
inseparable
from
the
name
,
would
have
*NL*
accompanied
him
through
life
like
his
shadow
,
and
,
in
the
end
,
made
a
*NL*
miser
and
a
rascal
of
him
,
in
spite
,
Sir
,
of
your
example
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
knew
a
man
able
to
answer
this
argument
.
--
But
,
indeed
,
to
speak
*NL*
of
my
father
as
he
was
;
--
he
was
certainly
irresistible
;
--
both
in
his
*NL*
orations
and
disputations
;
--
he
was
born
an
orator
;
--
-LRB-
Greek
-RRB-
.
--
Persuasion
*NL*
hung
upon
his
lips
,
and
the
elements
of
Logick
and
Rhetorick
were
*NL*
so
blended
up
in
him
,
--
and
,
withal
,
he
had
so
shrewd
a
guess
at
the
*NL*
weaknesses
and
passions
of
his
respondent
,
--
that
Nature
might
have
stood
*NL*
up
and
said
,
--
`
This
man
is
eloquent
.
'
--
In
short
,
whether
he
was
on
the
*NL*
weak
or
the
strong
side
of
the
question
,
't
was
hazardous
in
either
case
*NL*
to
attack
him
.
--
And
yet
,
't
is
strange
,
he
had
never
read
Cicero
,
nor
*NL*
Quintilian
de
Oratore
,
nor
Isocrates
,
nor
Aristotle
,
nor
Longinus
,
*NL*
amongst
the
antients
;
--
nor
Vossius
,
nor
Skioppius
,
nor
Ramus
,
nor
*NL*
Farnaby
,
amongst
the
moderns
;
--
and
what
is
more
astonishing
,
he
had
*NL*
never
in
his
whole
life
the
least
light
or
spark
of
subtilty
struck
into
*NL*
his
mind
,
by
one
single
lecture
upon
Crackenthorp
or
Burgersdicius
or
*NL*
any
Dutch
logician
or
commentator
;
--
he
knew
not
so
much
as
in
what
the
*NL*
difference
of
an
argument
ad
ignorantiam
,
and
an
argument
ad
hominem
*NL*
consisted
;
so
that
I
well
remember
,
when
he
went
up
along
with
me
to
*NL*
enter
my
name
at
Jesus
College
in
...
,
--
it
was
a
matter
of
just
*NL*
wonder
with
my
worthy
tutor
,
and
two
or
three
fellows
of
that
learned
*NL*
society
,
--
that
a
man
who
knew
not
so
much
as
the
names
of
his
tools
,
*NL*
should
be
able
to
work
after
that
fashion
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
work
with
them
in
the
best
manner
he
could
,
was
what
my
father
*NL*
was
,
however
,
perpetually
forced
upon
;
--
for
he
had
a
thousand
little
*NL*
sceptical
notions
of
the
comick
kind
to
defend
--
most
of
which
notions
,
I
*NL*
verily
believe
,
at
first
entered
upon
the
footing
of
mere
whims
,
and
of
*NL*
a
vive
la
Bagatelle
;
and
as
such
he
would
make
merry
with
them
for
half
*NL*
an
hour
or
so
,
and
having
sharpened
his
wit
upon
them
,
dismiss
them
till
*NL*
another
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
mention
this
,
not
only
as
matter
of
hypothesis
or
conjecture
upon
the
*NL*
progress
and
establishment
of
my
father
's
many
odd
opinions
,
--
but
as
a
*NL*
warning
to
the
learned
reader
against
the
indiscreet
reception
of
such
*NL*
guests
,
who
,
after
a
free
and
undisturbed
entrance
,
for
some
years
,
*NL*
into
our
brains
,
--
at
length
claim
a
kind
of
settlement
there
,
--
working
*NL*
sometimes
like
yeast
;
--
but
more
generally
after
the
manner
of
the
gentle
*NL*
passion
,
beginning
in
jest
,
--
but
ending
in
downright
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
this
was
the
case
of
the
singularity
of
my
father
's
notions
--
or
*NL*
that
his
judgment
,
at
length
,
became
the
dupe
of
his
wit
;
--
or
how
far
,
*NL*
in
many
of
his
notions
,
he
might
,
though
odd
,
be
absolutely
right
;
--
the
*NL*
reader
,
as
he
comes
at
them
,
shall
decide
.
All
that
I
maintain
here
,
is
,
*NL*
that
in
this
one
,
of
the
influence
of
christian
names
,
however
it
gained
*NL*
footing
,
he
was
serious
;
--
he
was
all
uniformity
;
--
he
was
systematical
,
*NL*
and
,
like
all
systematic
reasoners
,
he
would
move
both
heaven
and
earth
,
*NL*
and
twist
and
torture
every
thing
in
nature
to
support
his
hypothesis
.
*NL*
In
a
word
I
repeat
it
over
again
;
--
he
was
serious
;
--
and
,
in
consequence
*NL*
of
it
,
he
would
lose
all
kind
of
patience
whenever
he
saw
people
,
*NL*
especially
of
condition
,
who
should
have
known
better
,
--
as
careless
and
*NL*
as
indifferent
about
the
name
they
imposed
upon
their
child
,
--
or
more
*NL*
so
,
than
in
the
choice
of
Ponto
or
Cupid
for
their
puppy-dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
he
would
say
,
look
'd
ill
;
--
and
had
,
moreover
,
this
particular
*NL*
aggravation
in
it
,
viz
.
That
when
once
a
vile
name
was
wrongfully
or
*NL*
injudiciously
given
,
't
was
not
like
the
case
of
a
man
's
character
,
*NL*
which
,
when
wrong
'd
,
might
hereafter
be
cleared
;
--
and
,
possibly
,
some
*NL*
time
or
other
,
if
not
in
the
man
's
life
,
at
least
after
his
death
,
--
be
,
*NL*
somehow
or
other
,
set
to
rights
with
the
world
:
But
the
injury
of
this
,
*NL*
he
would
say
,
could
never
be
undone
;
--
nay
,
he
doubted
even
whether
an
*NL*
act
of
parliament
could
reach
it
:
--
He
knew
as
well
as
you
,
that
the
*NL*
legislature
assumed
a
power
over
surnames
;
--
but
for
very
strong
reasons
,
*NL*
which
he
could
give
,
it
had
never
yet
adventured
,
he
would
say
,
to
go
a
*NL*
step
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
observable
,
that
tho
'
my
father
,
in
consequence
of
this
opinion
,
*NL*
had
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
the
strongest
likings
and
dislikings
towards
*NL*
certain
names
;
--
that
there
were
still
numbers
of
names
which
hung
so
*NL*
equally
in
the
balance
before
him
,
that
they
were
absolutely
indifferent
*NL*
to
him
.
Jack
,
Dick
,
and
Tom
were
of
this
class
:
These
my
father
called
*NL*
neutral
names
;
--
affirming
of
them
,
without
a
satire
,
That
there
had
*NL*
been
as
many
knaves
and
fools
,
at
least
,
as
wise
and
good
men
,
since
*NL*
the
world
began
,
who
had
indifferently
borne
them
;
--
so
that
,
like
equal
*NL*
forces
acting
against
each
other
in
contrary
directions
,
he
thought
*NL*
they
mutually
destroyed
each
other
's
effects
;
for
which
reason
,
he
would
*NL*
often
declare
,
He
would
not
give
a
cherry-stone
to
choose
amongst
them
.
*NL*
Bob
,
which
was
my
brother
's
name
,
was
another
of
these
neutral
kinds
of
*NL*
christian
names
,
which
operated
very
little
either
way
;
and
as
my
father
*NL*
happen
'd
to
be
at
Epsom
,
when
it
was
given
him
,
--
he
would
oft-times
*NL*
thank
Heaven
it
was
no
worse
.
Andrew
was
something
like
a
*NL*
negative
quantity
in
Algebra
with
him
;
--
't
was
worse
,
he
said
,
than
*NL*
nothing
.
--
William
stood
pretty
high
:
--
Numps
again
was
low
with
him
:
--
and
*NL*
Nick
,
he
said
,
was
the
Devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
of
all
names
in
the
universe
he
had
the
most
unconquerable
aversion
*NL*
for
Tristram
;
--
he
had
the
lowest
and
most
contemptible
opinion
of
it
of
*NL*
any
thing
in
the
world
,
--
thinking
it
could
possibly
produce
nothing
in
*NL*
rerum
natura
,
but
what
was
extremely
mean
and
pitiful
:
So
that
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
a
dispute
on
the
subject
,
in
which
,
by
the
bye
,
he
was
*NL*
frequently
involved
,
--
he
would
sometimes
break
off
in
a
sudden
and
*NL*
spirited
Epiphonema
,
or
rather
Erotesis
,
raised
a
third
,
and
sometimes
a
*NL*
full
fifth
above
the
key
of
the
discourse
,
--
and
demand
it
categorically
*NL*
of
his
antagonist
,
Whether
he
would
take
upon
him
to
say
,
he
had
ever
*NL*
remembered
,
--
whether
he
had
ever
read
,
--
or
even
whether
he
had
ever
*NL*
heard
tell
of
a
man
,
called
Tristram
,
performing
any
thing
great
*NL*
or
worth
recording
?
--
No
,
--
he
would
say
,
--
Tristram
!
--
The
thing
is
*NL*
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
be
wanting
in
my
father
but
to
have
wrote
a
book
to
*NL*
publish
this
notion
of
his
to
the
world
?
Little
boots
it
to
the
subtle
*NL*
speculatist
to
stand
single
in
his
opinions
,
--
unless
he
gives
them
*NL*
proper
vent
:
--
It
was
the
identical
thing
which
my
father
did
:
--
for
in
*NL*
the
year
sixteen
,
which
was
two
years
before
I
was
born
,
he
was
at
*NL*
the
pains
of
writing
an
express
Dissertation
simply
upon
the
word
*NL*
Tristram
,
--
shewing
the
world
,
with
great
candour
and
modesty
,
the
*NL*
grounds
of
his
great
abhorrence
to
the
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
story
is
compared
with
the
title-page
,
--
Will
not
the
*NL*
gentle
reader
pity
my
father
from
his
soul
?
--
to
see
an
orderly
and
*NL*
well-disposed
gentleman
,
who
tho
'
singular
,
--
yet
inoffensive
in
his
*NL*
notions
,
--
so
played
upon
in
them
by
cross
purposes
;
--
to
look
down
upon
*NL*
the
stage
,
and
see
him
baffled
and
overthrown
in
all
his
little
systems
*NL*
and
wishes
;
to
behold
a
train
of
events
perpetually
falling
out
against
*NL*
him
,
and
in
so
critical
and
cruel
a
way
,
as
if
they
had
purposedly
been
*NL*
plann
'd
and
pointed
against
him
,
merely
to
insult
his
speculations
.
--
In
*NL*
a
word
,
to
behold
such
a
one
,
in
his
old
age
,
ill-fitted
for
troubles
,
*NL*
ten
times
in
a
day
suffering
sorrow
;
--
ten
times
in
a
day
calling
the
*NL*
child
of
his
prayers
Tristram
!
--
Melancholy
dissyllable
of
sound
!
which
,
*NL*
to
his
ears
,
was
unison
to
Nincompoop
,
and
every
name
vituperative
*NL*
under
heaven
.
--
By
his
ashes
!
I
swear
it
,
--
if
ever
malignant
spirit
took
*NL*
pleasure
,
or
busied
itself
in
traversing
the
purposes
of
mortal
man
,
--
it
*NL*
must
have
been
here
;
--
and
if
it
was
not
necessary
I
should
be
born
*NL*
before
I
was
christened
,
I
would
this
moment
give
the
reader
an
account
*NL*
of
it
.

Chapter
1
.
XX
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
could
you
,
Madam
,
be
so
inattentive
in
reading
the
last
chapter
?
I
*NL*
told
you
in
it
,
That
my
mother
was
not
a
papist
.
--
Papist
!
You
told
me
*NL*
no
such
thing
,
Sir
.
--
Madam
,
I
beg
leave
to
repeat
it
over
again
,
that
I
*NL*
told
you
as
plain
,
at
least
,
as
words
,
by
direct
inference
,
could
tell
*NL*
you
such
a
thing
.
--
Then
,
Sir
,
I
must
have
miss
'd
a
page
.
--
No
,
Madam
,
*NL*
you
have
not
miss
'd
a
word
.
--
Then
I
was
asleep
,
Sir
.
--
My
pride
,
Madam
,
*NL*
can
not
allow
you
that
refuge
.
--
Then
,
I
declare
,
I
know
nothing
at
all
*NL*
about
the
matter
.
--
That
,
Madam
,
is
the
very
fault
I
lay
to
your
charge
;
*NL*
and
as
a
punishment
for
it
,
I
do
insist
upon
it
,
that
you
immediately
*NL*
turn
back
,
that
is
as
soon
as
you
get
to
the
next
full
stop
,
and
read
*NL*
the
whole
chapter
over
again
.
I
have
imposed
this
penance
upon
the
lady
,
*NL*
neither
out
of
wantonness
nor
cruelty
;
but
from
the
best
of
motives
;
and
*NL*
therefore
shall
make
her
no
apology
for
it
when
she
returns
back
:
--
'T
is
*NL*
to
rebuke
a
vicious
taste
,
which
has
crept
into
thousands
besides
*NL*
herself
,
--
of
reading
straight
forwards
,
more
in
quest
of
the
adventures
,
*NL*
than
of
the
deep
erudition
and
knowledge
which
a
book
of
this
cast
,
if
*NL*
read
over
as
it
should
be
,
would
infallibly
impart
with
them
--
The
*NL*
mind
should
be
accustomed
to
make
wise
reflections
,
and
draw
curious
*NL*
conclusions
as
it
goes
along
;
the
habitude
of
which
made
Pliny
the
*NL*
younger
affirm
,
`
That
he
never
read
a
book
so
bad
,
but
he
drew
some
*NL*
profit
from
it
.
'
The
stories
of
Greece
and
Rome
,
run
over
without
this
*NL*
turn
and
application
,
--
do
less
service
,
I
affirm
it
,
than
the
history
of
*NL*
Parismus
and
Parismenus
,
or
of
the
Seven
Champions
of
England
,
read
with
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
here
comes
my
fair
lady
.
Have
you
read
over
again
the
chapter
,
*NL*
Madam
,
as
I
desired
you
?
--
You
have
:
And
did
you
not
observe
the
passage
,
*NL*
upon
the
second
reading
,
which
admits
the
inference
?
--
Not
a
word
like
*NL*
it
!
Then
,
Madam
,
be
pleased
to
ponder
well
the
last
line
but
one
of
the
*NL*
chapter
,
where
I
take
upon
me
to
say
,
`
It
was
necessary
I
should
be
*NL*
born
before
I
was
christen
'd
.
'
Had
my
mother
,
Madam
,
been
a
Papist
,
that
*NL*
consequence
did
not
follow
.
-LRB-
The
Romish
Rituals
direct
the
baptizing
*NL*
of
the
child
,
in
cases
of
danger
,
before
it
is
born
;
--
but
upon
this
*NL*
proviso
,
That
some
part
or
other
of
the
child
's
body
be
seen
by
the
*NL*
baptizer
:
--
But
the
Doctors
of
the
Sorbonne
,
by
a
deliberation
held
*NL*
amongst
them
,
April
10
,
1733
,
--
have
enlarged
the
powers
of
the
*NL*
midwives
,
by
determining
,
That
though
no
part
of
the
child
's
body
should
*NL*
appear
,
--
that
baptism
shall
,
nevertheless
,
be
administered
to
it
by
*NL*
injection
,
--
par
le
moyen
d'une
petite
canulle
,
--
Anglice
a
squirt
.
--
'T
is
*NL*
very
strange
that
St.
Thomas
Aquinas
,
who
had
so
good
a
mechanical
head
,
*NL*
both
for
tying
and
untying
the
knots
of
school-divinity
,
--
should
,
after
*NL*
so
much
pains
bestowed
upon
this
,
--
give
up
the
point

O

Thomas

*NL*
If
the
reader
has
the
curiosity
to
see
the
question
upon
baptism
by
*NL*
injection
,
as
presented
to
the
Doctors
of
the
Sorbonne
,
with
their
*NL*
consultation
thereupon
,
it
is
as
follows
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
terrible
misfortune
for
this
same
book
of
mine
,
but
more
so
to
*NL*
the
Republick
of
letters
;
--
so
that
my
own
is
quite
swallowed
up
in
*NL*
the
consideration
of
it
,
--
that
this
self-same
vile
pruriency
for
*NL*
fresh
adventures
in
all
things
,
has
got
so
strongly
into
our
habit
and
*NL*
humour
,
--
and
so
wholly
intent
are
we
upon
satisfying
the
impatience
of
*NL*
our
concupiscence
that
way
,
--
that
nothing
but
the
gross
and
more
*NL*
carnal
parts
of
a
composition
will
go
down
:
--
The
subtle
hints
and
sly
*NL*
communications
of
science
fly
off
,
like
spirits
upwards
,
--
the
heavy
*NL*
moral
escapes
downwards
;
and
both
the
one
and
the
other
are
as
much
lost
*NL*
to
the
world
,
as
if
they
were
still
left
in
the
bottom
of
the
ink-horn
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
the
male-reader
has
not
pass
'd
by
many
a
one
,
as
quaint
and
*NL*
curious
as
this
one
,
in
which
the
female-reader
has
been
detected
.
I
*NL*
wish
it
may
have
its
effects
;
--
and
that
all
good
people
,
both
male
and
*NL*
female
,
from
example
,
may
be
taught
to
think
as
well
as

*NL*
*NL*
--
I
wonder
what
's
all
that
noise
,
and
running
backwards
and
forwards
*NL*
for
,
above
stairs
,
quoth
my
father
,
addressing
himself
,
after
an
hour
*NL*
and
a
half
's
silence
,
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
who
,
you
must
know
,
was
sitting
*NL*
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fire
,
smoaking
his
social
pipe
all
the
time
,
*NL*
in
mute
contemplation
of
a
new
pair
of
black
plush-breeches
which
he
*NL*
had
got
on
:
--
What
can
they
be
doing
,
brother
?
--
quoth
my
father
,
--
we
can
*NL*
scarce
hear
ourselves
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
taking
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
and
*NL*
striking
the
head
of
it
two
or
three
times
upon
the
nail
of
his
left
*NL*
thumb
,
as
he
began
his
sentence
,
--
I
think
,
says
he
:
--
But
to
enter
*NL*
rightly
into
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentiments
upon
this
matter
,
you
must
be
*NL*
made
to
enter
first
a
little
into
his
character
,
the
out-lines
of
which
*NL*
I
shall
just
give
you
,
and
then
the
dialogue
between
him
and
my
father
*NL*
will
go
on
as
well
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pray
what
was
that
man
's
name
,
--
for
I
write
in
such
a
hurry
,
I
have
no
*NL*
time
to
recollect
or
look
for
it
,
--
who
first
made
the
observation
,
`
That
*NL*
there
was
great
inconstancy
in
our
air
and
climate
?
'
Whoever
he
was
,
*NL*
't
was
a
just
and
good
observation
in
him
.
--
But
the
corollary
drawn
from
*NL*
it
,
namely
,
`
That
it
is
this
which
has
furnished
us
with
such
a
variety
*NL*
of
odd
and
whimsical
characters
;
'
--
that
was
not
his
;
--
it
was
found
*NL*
out
by
another
man
,
at
least
a
century
and
a
half
after
him
:
Then
*NL*
again
,
--
that
this
copious
store-house
of
original
materials
,
is
the
true
*NL*
and
natural
cause
that
our
Comedies
are
so
much
better
than
those
*NL*
of
France
,
or
any
others
that
either
have
,
or
can
be
wrote
upon
the
*NL*
Continent
:
--
that
discovery
was
not
fully
made
till
about
the
middle
of
*NL*
King
William
's
reign
,
--
when
the
great
Dryden
,
in
writing
one
of
his
long
*NL*
prefaces
,
-LRB-
if
I
mistake
not
-RRB-
most
fortunately
hit
upon
it
.
Indeed
toward
*NL*
the
latter
end
of
queen
Anne
,
the
great
Addison
began
to
patronize
the
*NL*
notion
,
and
more
fully
explained
it
to
the
world
in
one
or
two
of
his
*NL*
Spectators
;
--
but
the
discovery
was
not
his
.
--
Then
,
fourthly
and
lastly
,
*NL*
that
this
strange
irregularity
in
our
climate
,
producing
so
strange
an
*NL*
irregularity
in
our
characters
,
--
doth
thereby
,
in
some
sort
,
make
us
*NL*
amends
,
by
giving
us
somewhat
to
make
us
merry
with
when
the
weather
*NL*
will
not
suffer
us
to
go
out
of
doors
,
--
that
observation
is
my
own
;
--
and
*NL*
was
struck
out
by
me
this
very
rainy
day
,
March
26
,
1759
,
and
betwixt
*NL*
the
hours
of
nine
and
ten
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
--
thus
,
my
fellow-labourers
and
associates
in
this
great
harvest
of
*NL*
our
learning
,
now
ripening
before
our
eyes
;
thus
it
is
,
by
slow
steps
*NL*
of
casual
increase
,
that
our
knowledge
physical
,
metaphysical
,
*NL*
physiological
,
polemical
,
nautical
,
mathematical
,
aenigmatical
,
*NL*
technical
,
biographical
,
romantical
,
chemical
,
and
obstetrical
,
with
*NL*
fifty
other
branches
of
it
,
-LRB-
most
of
'em
ending
as
these
do
,
in
ical
-RRB-
*NL*
have
for
these
two
last
centuries
and
more
,
gradually
been
creeping
*NL*
upwards
towards
that
Akme
of
their
perfections
,
from
which
,
if
we
may
*NL*
form
a
conjecture
from
the
advances
of
these
last
seven
years
,
we
can
not
*NL*
possibly
be
far
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
that
happens
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
,
it
will
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
*NL*
writings
whatsoever
;
--
the
want
of
all
kind
of
writing
will
put
an
end
to
*NL*
all
kind
of
reading
;
--
and
that
in
time
,
As
war
begets
poverty
;
poverty
*NL*
peace
,
--
must
,
in
course
,
put
an
end
to
all
kind
of
knowledge
,
--
and
*NL*
then
--
we
shall
have
all
to
begin
over
again
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
be
*NL*
exactly
where
we
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Happy
!
Thrice
happy
times
!
I
only
wish
that
the
aera
of
my
begetting
,
*NL*
as
well
as
the
mode
and
manner
of
it
,
had
been
a
little
alter
'd
,
--
or
*NL*
that
it
could
have
been
put
off
,
with
any
convenience
to
my
father
or
*NL*
mother
,
for
some
twenty
or
five-and-twenty
years
longer
,
when
a
man
in
*NL*
the
literary
world
might
have
stood
some
chance
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
forget
my
uncle
Toby
,
whom
all
this
while
we
have
left
knocking
*NL*
the
ashes
out
of
his
tobacco-pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
humour
was
of
that
particular
species
,
which
does
honour
to
our
*NL*
atmosphere
;
and
I
should
have
made
no
scruple
of
ranking
him
amongst
*NL*
one
of
the
first-rate
productions
of
it
,
had
not
there
appeared
too
many
*NL*
strong
lines
in
it
of
a
family-likeness
,
which
shewed
that
he
derived
*NL*
the
singularity
of
his
temper
more
from
blood
,
than
either
wind
or
*NL*
water
,
or
any
modifications
or
combinations
of
them
whatever
:
And
I
*NL*
have
,
therefore
,
oft-times
wondered
,
that
my
father
,
tho
'
I
believe
he
*NL*
had
his
reasons
for
it
,
upon
his
observing
some
tokens
of
eccentricity
,
*NL*
in
my
course
,
when
I
was
a
boy
,
--
should
never
once
endeavour
to
account
*NL*
for
them
in
this
way
:
for
all
the
Shandy
Family
were
of
an
original
*NL*
character
throughout
:
--
I
mean
the
males
,
--
the
females
had
no
character
*NL*
at
all
,
--
except
,
indeed
,
my
great
aunt
Dinah
,
who
,
about
sixty
years
*NL*
ago
,
was
married
and
got
with
child
by
the
coachman
,
for
which
my
*NL*
father
,
according
to
his
hypothesis
of
christian
names
,
would
often
say
,
*NL*
She
might
thank
her
godfathers
and
godmothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
seem
strange
,
--
and
I
would
as
soon
think
of
dropping
a
riddle
*NL*
in
the
reader
's
way
,
which
is
not
my
interest
to
do
,
as
set
him
upon
*NL*
guessing
how
it
could
come
to
pass
,
that
an
event
of
this
kind
,
so
many
*NL*
years
after
it
had
happened
,
should
be
reserved
for
the
interruption
of
*NL*
the
peace
and
unity
,
which
otherwise
so
cordially
subsisted
,
between
my
*NL*
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
.
One
would
have
thought
,
that
the
whole
force
*NL*
of
the
misfortune
should
have
spent
and
wasted
itself
in
the
family
at
*NL*
first
,
--
as
is
generally
the
case
.
--
But
nothing
ever
wrought
with
our
*NL*
family
after
the
ordinary
way
.
Possibly
at
the
very
time
this
happened
,
*NL*
it
might
have
something
else
to
afflict
it
;
and
as
afflictions
are
sent
*NL*
down
for
our
good
,
and
that
as
this
had
never
done
the
Shandy
Family
*NL*
any
good
at
all
,
it
might
lie
waiting
till
apt
times
and
circumstances
*NL*
should
give
it
an
opportunity
to
discharge
its
office
.
--
Observe
,
*NL*
I
determine
nothing
upon
this
.
--
My
way
is
ever
to
point
out
to
the
*NL*
curious
,
different
tracts
of
investigation
,
to
come
at
the
first
springs
*NL*
of
the
events
I
tell
;
--
not
with
a
pedantic
Fescue
,
--
or
in
the
decisive
*NL*
manner
or
Tacitus
,
who
outwits
himself
and
his
reader
;
--
but
with
the
*NL*
officious
humility
of
a
heart
devoted
to
the
assistance
merely
of
the
*NL*
inquisitive
;
--
to
them
I
write
,
--
and
by
them
I
shall
be
read
,
--
if
any
*NL*
such
reading
as
this
could
be
supposed
to
hold
out
so
long
,
--
to
the
very
*NL*
end
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
this
cause
of
sorrow
,
therefore
,
was
thus
reserved
for
my
father
and
*NL*
uncle
,
is
undetermined
by
me
.
But
how
and
in
what
direction
it
exerted
*NL*
itself
so
as
to
become
the
cause
of
dissatisfaction
between
them
,
after
*NL*
it
began
to
operate
,
is
what
I
am
able
to
explain
with
great
exactness
,
*NL*
and
is
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
Shandy
,
Madam
,
was
a
gentleman
,
who
,
with
the
virtues
*NL*
which
usually
constitute
the
character
of
a
man
of
honour
and
*NL*
rectitude
,
--
possessed
one
in
a
very
eminent
degree
,
which
is
seldom
*NL*
or
never
put
into
the
catalogue
;
and
that
was
a
most
extreme
and
*NL*
unparallel
'd
modesty
of
nature
;
--
though
I
correct
the
word
nature
,
for
*NL*
this
reason
,
that
I
may
not
prejudge
a
point
which
must
shortly
come
*NL*
to
a
hearing
,
and
that
is
,
Whether
this
modesty
of
his
was
natural
or
*NL*
acquir
'd
.
--
Whichever
way
my
uncle
Toby
came
by
it
,
't
was
nevertheless
*NL*
modesty
in
the
truest
sense
of
it
;
and
that
is
,
Madam
,
not
in
regard
to
*NL*
words
,
for
he
was
so
unhappy
as
to
have
very
little
choice
in
them
,
--
but
*NL*
to
things
;
--
and
this
kind
of
modesty
so
possessed
him
,
and
it
arose
to
*NL*
such
a
height
in
him
,
as
almost
to
equal
,
if
such
a
thing
could
be
,
*NL*
even
the
modesty
of
a
woman
:
That
female
nicety
,
Madam
,
and
inward
*NL*
cleanliness
of
mind
and
fancy
,
in
your
sex
,
which
makes
you
so
much
the
*NL*
awe
of
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
will
imagine
,
Madam
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
had
contracted
all
this
*NL*
from
this
very
source
;
--
that
he
had
spent
a
great
part
of
his
time
in
*NL*
converse
with
your
sex
,
and
that
from
a
thorough
knowledge
of
you
,
and
*NL*
the
force
of
imitation
which
such
fair
examples
render
irresistible
,
he
*NL*
had
acquired
this
amiable
turn
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
I
could
say
so
,
--
for
unless
it
was
with
his
sister-in-law
,
my
*NL*
father
's
wife
and
my
mother
--
my
uncle
Toby
scarce
exchanged
three
words
*NL*
with
the
sex
in
as
many
years
;
--
no
,
he
got
it
,
Madam
,
by
a
blow
.
--
A
*NL*
blow
!
--
Yes
,
Madam
,
it
was
owing
to
a
blow
from
a
stone
,
broke
off
by
a
*NL*
ball
from
the
parapet
of
a
horn-work
at
the
siege
of
Namur
,
which
struck
*NL*
full
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
.
--
Which
way
could
that
effect
it
?
The
*NL*
story
of
that
,
Madam
,
is
long
and
interesting
;
--
but
it
would
be
running
*NL*
my
history
all
upon
heaps
to
give
it
you
here
.
--
'T
is
for
an
episode
*NL*
hereafter
;
and
every
circumstance
relating
to
it
,
in
its
proper
place
,
*NL*
shall
be
faithfully
laid
before
you
:
--
'Till
then
,
it
is
not
in
my
power
*NL*
to
give
farther
light
into
this
matter
,
or
say
more
than
what
I
have
*NL*
said
already
,
--
That
my
uncle
Toby
was
a
gentleman
of
unparallel
'd
*NL*
modesty
,
which
happening
to
be
somewhat
subtilized
and
rarified
by
the
*NL*
constant
heat
of
a
little
family
pride
,
--
they
both
so
wrought
together
*NL*
within
him
,
that
he
could
never
bear
to
hear
the
affair
of
my
aunt
Dinah
*NL*
touch
'd
upon
,
but
with
the
greatest
emotion
.
--
The
least
hint
of
it
was
*NL*
enough
to
make
the
blood
fly
into
his
face
;
--
but
when
my
father
enlarged
*NL*
upon
the
story
in
mixed
companies
,
which
the
illustration
of
his
*NL*
hypothesis
frequently
obliged
him
to
do
,
--
the
unfortunate
blight
of
one
*NL*
of
the
fairest
branches
of
the
family
,
would
set
my
uncle
Toby
's
honour
*NL*
and
modesty
o'bleeding
;
and
he
would
often
take
my
father
aside
,
in
the
*NL*
greatest
concern
imaginable
,
to
expostulate
and
tell
him
,
he
would
give
*NL*
him
any
thing
in
the
world
,
only
to
let
the
story
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
I
believe
,
had
the
truest
love
and
tenderness
for
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
,
that
ever
one
brother
bore
towards
another
,
and
would
have
done
*NL*
any
thing
in
nature
,
which
one
brother
in
reason
could
have
desir
'd
of
*NL*
another
,
to
have
made
my
uncle
Toby
's
heart
easy
in
this
,
or
any
other
*NL*
point
.
But
this
lay
out
of
his
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
father
,
as
I
told
you
was
a
philosopher
in
*NL*
grain
,
--
speculative
,
--
systematical
;
--
and
my
aunt
Dinah
's
affair
was
*NL*
a
matter
of
as
much
consequence
to
him
,
as
the
retrogradation
of
the
*NL*
planets
to
Copernicus
:
--
The
backslidings
of
Venus
in
her
orbit
fortified
*NL*
the
Copernican
system
,
called
so
after
his
name
;
and
the
backslidings
*NL*
of
my
aunt
Dinah
in
her
orbit
,
did
the
same
service
in
establishing
my
*NL*
father
's
system
,
which
,
I
trust
,
will
for
ever
hereafter
be
called
the
*NL*
Shandean
System
,
after
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
any
other
family
dishonour
,
my
father
,
I
believe
,
had
as
nice
a
*NL*
sense
of
shame
as
any
man
whatever
;
--
and
neither
he
,
nor
,
I
dare
say
,
*NL*
Copernicus
,
would
have
divulged
the
affair
in
either
case
,
or
have
taken
*NL*
the
least
notice
of
it
to
the
world
,
but
for
the
obligations
they
*NL*
owed
,
as
they
thought
,
to
truth
.
--
Amicus
Plato
,
my
father
would
say
,
*NL*
construing
the
words
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
he
went
along
,
Amicus
Plato
;
*NL*
that
is
,
Dinah
was
my
aunt
;
--
sed
magis
amica
veritas
--
but
Truth
is
my
*NL*
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
contrariety
of
humours
betwixt
my
father
and
my
uncle
,
was
the
*NL*
source
of
many
a
fraternal
squabble
.
The
one
could
not
bear
to
hear
the
*NL*
tale
of
family
disgrace
recorded
,
--
and
the
other
would
scarce
ever
let
a
*NL*
day
pass
to
an
end
without
some
hint
at
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
God
's
sake
,
my
uncle
Toby
would
cry
,
--
and
for
my
sake
,
and
for
all
*NL*
our
sakes
,
my
dear
brother
Shandy
,
--
do
let
this
story
of
our
aunt
's
*NL*
and
her
ashes
sleep
in
peace
;
--
how
can
you
,
--
how
can
you
have
so
little
*NL*
feeling
and
compassion
for
the
character
of
our
family
?
--
What
is
the
*NL*
character
of
a
family
to
an
hypothesis
?
my
father
would
reply
.
--
Nay
,
*NL*
if
you
come
to
that
--
what
is
the
life
of
a
family
?
--
The
life
of
a
*NL*
family
!
--
my
uncle
Toby
would
say
,
throwing
himself
back
in
his
arm
*NL*
chair
,
and
lifting
up
his
hands
,
his
eyes
,
and
one
leg
--
Yes
,
the
*NL*
life
,
--
my
father
would
say
,
maintaining
his
point
.
How
many
thousands
*NL*
of
'em
are
there
every
year
that
come
cast
away
,
-LRB-
in
all
civilized
*NL*
countries
at
least
-RRB-
--
and
considered
as
nothing
but
common
air
,
in
*NL*
competition
of
an
hypothesis
.
In
my
plain
sense
of
things
,
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
would
answer
,
--
every
such
instance
is
downright
Murder
,
let
who
will
*NL*
commit
it
.
--
There
lies
your
mistake
,
my
father
would
reply
;
--
for
,
in
*NL*
Foro
Scientiae
there
is
no
such
thing
as
Murder
,
--
't
is
only
Death
,
*NL*
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
would
never
offer
to
answer
this
by
any
other
kind
of
*NL*
argument
,
than
that
of
whistling
half
a
dozen
bars
of
Lillebullero
.
--
You
*NL*
must
know
it
was
the
usual
channel
thro
'
which
his
passions
got
vent
,
*NL*
when
any
thing
shocked
or
surprized
him
:
--
but
especially
when
any
thing
,
*NL*
which
he
deem
'd
very
absurd
,
was
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
not
one
of
our
logical
writers
,
nor
any
of
the
commentators
upon
*NL*
them
,
that
I
remember
,
have
thought
proper
to
give
a
name
to
this
*NL*
particular
species
of
argument
.
--
I
here
take
the
liberty
to
do
it
*NL*
myself
,
for
two
reasons
.
First
,
That
,
in
order
to
prevent
all
confusion
*NL*
in
disputes
,
it
may
stand
as
much
distinguished
for
ever
,
from
every
*NL*
other
species
of
argument
--
as
the
Argumentum
ad
Verecundiam
,
ex
Absurdo
,
*NL*
ex
Fortiori
,
or
any
other
argument
whatsoever
:
--
And
,
secondly
,
That
*NL*
it
may
be
said
by
my
children
's
children
,
when
my
head
is
laid
to
*NL*
rest
,
--
that
their
learn
'd
grandfather
's
head
had
been
busied
to
as
*NL*
much
purpose
once
,
as
other
people
's
;
--
That
he
had
invented
a
name
,
and
*NL*
generously
thrown
it
into
the
Treasury
of
the
Ars
Logica
,
for
one
of
*NL*
the
most
unanswerable
arguments
in
the
whole
science
.
And
,
if
the
end
*NL*
of
disputation
is
more
to
silence
than
convince
,
--
they
may
add
,
if
they
*NL*
please
,
to
one
of
the
best
arguments
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
,
therefore
,
by
these
presents
,
strictly
order
and
command
,
That
*NL*
it
be
known
and
distinguished
by
the
name
and
title
of
the
Argumentum
*NL*
Fistulatorium
,
and
no
other
;
--
and
that
it
rank
hereafter
with
the
*NL*
Argumentum
Baculinum
and
the
Argumentum
ad
Crumenam
,
and
for
ever
*NL*
hereafter
be
treated
of
in
the
same
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
Argumentum
Tripodium
,
which
is
never
used
but
by
the
woman
*NL*
against
the
man
;
--
and
the
Argumentum
ad
Rem
,
which
,
contrarywise
,
is
*NL*
made
use
of
by
the
man
only
against
the
woman
;
--
As
these
two
are
enough
*NL*
in
conscience
for
one
lecture
;
--
and
,
moreover
,
as
the
one
is
the
best
*NL*
answer
to
the
other
,
--
let
them
likewise
be
kept
apart
,
and
be
treated
of
*NL*
in
a
place
by
themselves
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
learned
Bishop
Hall
,
I
mean
the
famous
Dr.
Joseph
Hall
,
who
was
*NL*
Bishop
of
Exeter
in
King
James
the
First
's
reign
,
tells
us
in
one
of
*NL*
Decads
,
at
the
end
of
his
divine
art
of
meditation
,
imprinted
at
London
,
*NL*
in
the
year
1610
,
by
John
Beal
,
dwelling
in
Aldersgate-street
,
`
That
*NL*
it
is
an
abominable
thing
for
a
man
to
commend
himself
;
'
--
and
I
really
*NL*
think
it
is
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
on
the
other
hand
,
when
a
thing
is
executed
in
a
masterly
kind
*NL*
of
a
fashion
,
which
thing
is
not
likely
to
be
found
out
;
--
I
think
it
is
*NL*
full
as
abominable
,
that
a
man
should
lose
the
honour
of
it
,
and
go
out
*NL*
of
the
world
with
the
conceit
of
it
rotting
in
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
precisely
my
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
in
this
long
digression
which
I
was
accidentally
led
into
,
as
in
all
*NL*
my
digressions
-LRB-
one
only
excepted
-RRB-
there
is
a
master-stroke
of
*NL*
digressive
skill
,
the
merit
of
which
has
all
along
,
I
fear
,
been
*NL*
over-looked
by
my
reader
,
--
not
for
want
of
penetration
in
him
,
--
but
*NL*
because
't
is
an
excellence
seldom
looked
for
,
or
expected
indeed
,
in
a
*NL*
digression
;
--
and
it
is
this
:
That
tho
'
my
digressions
are
all
fair
,
as
*NL*
you
observe
,
--
and
that
I
fly
off
from
what
I
am
about
,
as
far
,
and
as
*NL*
often
too
,
as
any
writer
in
Great
Britain
;
yet
I
constantly
take
care
*NL*
to
order
affairs
so
that
my
main
business
does
not
stand
still
in
my
*NL*
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
just
going
,
for
example
,
to
have
given
you
the
great
out-lines
of
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
most
whimsical
character
;
--
when
my
aunt
Dinah
and
the
*NL*
coachman
came
across
us
,
and
led
us
a
vagary
some
millions
of
miles
into
*NL*
the
very
heart
of
the
planetary
system
:
Notwithstanding
all
this
,
you
*NL*
perceive
that
the
drawing
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
went
on
gently
*NL*
all
the
time
;
--
not
the
great
contours
of
it
,
--
that
was
impossible
,
--
but
*NL*
some
familiar
strokes
and
faint
designations
of
it
,
were
here
and
there
*NL*
touch
'd
on
,
as
we
went
along
,
so
that
you
are
much
better
acquainted
*NL*
with
my
uncle
Toby
now
than
you
was
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
contrivance
the
machinery
of
my
work
is
of
a
species
by
itself
;
*NL*
two
contrary
motions
are
introduced
into
it
,
and
reconciled
,
which
*NL*
were
thought
to
be
at
variance
with
each
other
.
In
a
word
,
my
work
is
*NL*
digressive
,
and
it
is
progressive
too
,
--
and
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
Sir
,
is
a
very
different
story
from
that
of
the
earth
's
moving
*NL*
round
her
axis
,
in
her
diurnal
rotation
,
with
her
progress
in
her
*NL*
elliptick
orbit
which
brings
about
the
year
,
and
constitutes
that
*NL*
variety
and
vicissitude
of
seasons
we
enjoy
;
--
though
I
own
it
suggested
*NL*
the
thought
,
--
as
I
believe
the
greatest
of
our
boasted
improvements
and
*NL*
discoveries
have
come
from
such
trifling
hints
.
*NL*
*NL*
Digressions
,
incontestably
,
are
the
sunshine
;
--
they
are
the
life
,
the
*NL*
soul
of
reading
!
--
take
them
out
of
this
book
,
for
instance
,
--
you
might
*NL*
as
well
take
the
book
along
with
them
;
--
one
cold
eternal
winter
would
*NL*
reign
in
every
page
of
it
;
restore
them
to
the
writer
;
--
he
steps
forth
*NL*
like
a
bridegroom
,
--
bids
All-hail
;
brings
in
variety
,
and
forbids
the
*NL*
appetite
to
fail
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
dexterity
is
in
the
good
cookery
and
management
of
them
,
so
as
*NL*
to
be
not
only
for
the
advantage
of
the
reader
,
but
also
of
the
author
,
*NL*
whose
distress
,
in
this
matter
,
is
truly
pitiable
:
For
,
if
he
begins
a
*NL*
digression
,
--
from
that
moment
,
I
observe
,
his
whole
work
stands
stock
*NL*
still
;
--
and
if
he
goes
on
with
his
main
work
,
--
then
there
is
an
end
of
*NL*
his
digression
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
is
vile
work
.
--
For
which
reason
,
from
the
beginning
of
this
,
you
*NL*
see
,
I
have
constructed
the
main
work
and
the
adventitious
parts
of
*NL*
it
with
such
intersections
,
and
have
so
complicated
and
involved
the
*NL*
digressive
and
progressive
movements
,
one
wheel
within
another
,
that
the
*NL*
whole
machine
,
in
general
,
has
been
kept
a-going
;
--
and
,
what
's
more
,
it
*NL*
shall
be
kept
a-going
these
forty
years
,
if
it
pleases
the
fountain
of
*NL*
health
to
bless
me
so
long
with
life
and
good
spirits
.

Chapter

XXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
a
strong
propensity
in
me
to
begin
this
chapter
very
*NL*
nonsensically
,
and
I
will
not
balk
my
fancy
.
--
Accordingly
I
set
off
*NL*
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
fixture
of
Momus
's
glass
in
the
human
breast
,
according
to
the
*NL*
proposed
emendation
of
that
arch-critick
,
had
taken
place
,
--
first
,
This
*NL*
foolish
consequence
would
certainly
have
followed
,
--
That
the
very
*NL*
wisest
and
very
gravest
of
us
all
,
in
one
coin
or
other
,
must
have
paid
*NL*
window-money
every
day
of
our
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
secondly
,
that
had
the
said
glass
been
there
set
up
,
nothing
more
*NL*
would
have
been
wanting
,
in
order
to
have
taken
a
man
's
character
,
but
*NL*
to
have
taken
a
chair
and
gone
softly
,
as
you
would
to
a
dioptrical
*NL*
bee-hive
,
and
look
'd
in
,
--
view
'd
the
soul
stark
naked
;
--
observed
all
*NL*
her
motions
,
--
her
machinations
;
--
traced
all
her
maggots
from
their
first
*NL*
engendering
to
their
crawling
forth
;
--
watched
her
loose
in
her
frisks
,
*NL*
her
gambols
,
her
capricios
;
and
after
some
notice
of
her
more
solemn
*NL*
deportment
,
consequent
upon
such
frisks
,
&
c.
--
then
taken
your
pen
and
*NL*
ink
and
set
down
nothing
but
what
you
had
seen
,
and
could
have
sworn
*NL*
to
:
--
But
this
is
an
advantage
not
to
be
had
by
the
biographer
in
this
*NL*
planet
;
--
in
the
planet
Mercury
-LRB-
belike
-RRB-
it
may
be
so
,
if
not
better
*NL*
still
for
him
;
--
for
there
the
intense
heat
of
the
country
,
which
is
*NL*
proved
by
computators
,
from
its
vicinity
to
the
sun
,
to
be
more
than
*NL*
equal
to
that
of
red-hot
iron
,
--
must
,
I
think
,
long
ago
have
vitrified
*NL*
the
bodies
of
the
inhabitants
,
-LRB-
as
the
efficient
cause
-RRB-
to
suit
them
for
*NL*
the
climate
-LRB-
which
is
the
final
cause
;-RRB-
so
that
betwixt
them
both
,
all
*NL*
the
tenements
of
their
souls
,
from
top
to
bottom
,
may
be
nothing
else
,
*NL*
for
aught
the
soundest
philosophy
can
shew
to
the
contrary
,
but
one
fine
*NL*
transparent
body
of
clear
glass
-LRB-
bating
the
umbilical
knot
-RRB-
--
so
that
,
*NL*
till
the
inhabitants
grow
old
and
tolerably
wrinkled
,
whereby
the
rays
*NL*
of
light
,
in
passing
through
them
,
become
so
monstrously
refracted
,
--
or
*NL*
return
reflected
from
their
surfaces
in
such
transverse
lines
to
the
*NL*
eye
,
that
a
man
can
not
be
seen
through
;
--
his
soul
might
as
well
,
unless
*NL*
for
mere
ceremony
,
or
the
trifling
advantage
which
the
umbilical
point
*NL*
gave
her
,
--
might
,
upon
all
other
accounts
,
I
say
,
as
well
play
the
fool
*NL*
out
o'doors
as
in
her
own
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
,
as
I
said
above
,
is
not
the
case
of
the
inhabitants
of
this
*NL*
earth
;
--
our
minds
shine
not
through
the
body
,
but
are
wrapt
up
here
in
*NL*
a
dark
covering
of
uncrystalized
flesh
and
blood
;
so
that
,
if
we
would
*NL*
come
to
the
specific
characters
of
them
,
we
must
go
some
other
way
to
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
,
in
good
truth
,
are
the
ways
,
which
human
wit
has
been
forced
to
*NL*
take
,
to
do
this
thing
with
exactness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
,
for
instance
,
draw
all
their
characters
with
*NL*
wind-instruments
.
--
Virgil
takes
notice
of
that
way
in
the
affair
of
*NL*
Dido
and
Aeneas
;
--
but
it
is
as
fallacious
as
the
breath
of
fame
;
--
and
,
*NL*
moreover
,
bespeaks
a
narrow
genius
.
I
am
not
ignorant
that
the
Italians
*NL*
pretend
to
a
mathematical
exactness
in
their
designations
of
one
*NL*
particular
sort
of
character
among
them
,
from
the
forte
or
piano
of
a
*NL*
certain
wind-instrument
they
use
,
--
which
they
say
is
infallible
.
--
I
dare
*NL*
not
mention
the
name
of
the
instrument
in
this
place
;
--
't
is
sufficient
*NL*
we
have
it
amongst
us
,
--
but
never
think
of
making
a
drawing
by
it
;
--
this
*NL*
is
aenigmatical
,
and
intended
to
be
so
,
at
least
ad
populum
:
--
And
*NL*
therefore
,
I
beg
,
Madam
,
when
you
come
here
,
that
you
read
on
as
fast
as
*NL*
you
can
,
and
never
stop
to
make
any
inquiry
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
others
again
,
who
will
draw
a
man
's
character
from
no
other
*NL*
helps
in
the
world
,
but
merely
from
his
evacuations
;
--
but
this
often
*NL*
gives
a
very
incorrect
outline
,
--
unless
,
indeed
,
you
take
a
sketch
*NL*
of
his
repletions
too
;
and
by
correcting
one
drawing
from
the
other
,
*NL*
compound
one
good
figure
out
of
them
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
no
objection
to
this
method
,
but
that
I
think
it
must
*NL*
smell
too
strong
of
the
lamp
,
--
and
be
render
'd
still
more
operose
,
by
*NL*
forcing
you
to
have
an
eye
to
the
rest
of
his
Non-naturals
.
--
Why
*NL*
the
most
natural
actions
of
a
man
's
life
should
be
called
his
*NL*
Non-naturals
,
--
is
another
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
others
,
fourthly
,
who
disdain
every
one
of
these
*NL*
expedients
;
--
not
from
any
fertility
of
their
own
,
but
from
the
various
*NL*
ways
of
doing
it
,
which
they
have
borrowed
from
the
honourable
devices
*NL*
which
the
Pentagraphic
Brethren
-LRB-
Pentagraph
,
an
instrument
to
copy
*NL*
Prints
and
Pictures
mechanically
,
and
in
any
proportion
.
-RRB-
of
the
brush
*NL*
have
shewn
in
taking
copies
.
--
These
,
you
must
know
,
are
your
great
*NL*
historians
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
you
will
see
drawing
a
full
length
character
against
the
*NL*
light
;
--
that
's
illiberal
,
--
dishonest
,
--
and
hard
upon
the
character
of
*NL*
the
man
who
sits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Others
,
to
mend
the
matter
,
will
make
a
drawing
of
you
in
the
*NL*
Camera
;
--
that
is
most
unfair
of
all
,
because
,
there
you
are
sure
to
be
*NL*
represented
in
some
of
your
most
ridiculous
attitudes
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
avoid
all
and
every
one
of
these
errors
in
giving
you
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
's
character
,
I
am
determined
to
draw
it
by
no
mechanical
help
*NL*
whatever
;
--
nor
shall
my
pencil
be
guided
by
any
one
wind-instrument
*NL*
which
ever
was
blown
upon
,
either
on
this
,
or
on
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
Alps
;
--
nor
will
I
consider
either
his
repletions
or
his
discharges
,
--
or
*NL*
touch
upon
his
Non-naturals
;
but
,
in
a
word
,
I
will
draw
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
character
from
his
Hobby-Horse
.

*NL*
*NL*
If
I
was
not
morally
sure
that
the
reader
must
be
out
of
all
patience
*NL*
for
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
,
--
I
would
here
previously
have
convinced
*NL*
him
that
there
is
no
instrument
so
fit
to
draw
such
a
thing
with
,
as
*NL*
that
which
I
have
pitch
'd
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
and
his
Hobby-Horse
,
tho
'
I
can
not
say
that
they
act
and
re-act
*NL*
exactly
after
the
same
manner
in
which
the
soul
and
body
do
upon
each
*NL*
other
:
Yet
doubtless
there
is
a
communication
between
them
of
some
kind
;
*NL*
and
my
opinion
rather
is
,
that
there
is
something
in
it
more
of
the
*NL*
manner
of
electrified
bodies
,
--
and
that
,
by
means
of
the
heated
parts
*NL*
of
the
rider
,
which
come
immediately
into
contact
with
the
back
of
the
*NL*
Hobby-Horse
,
--
by
long
journies
and
much
friction
,
it
so
happens
,
that
*NL*
the
body
of
the
rider
is
at
length
fill
'd
as
full
of
Hobby-Horsical
*NL*
matter
as
it
can
hold
;
--
so
that
if
you
are
able
to
give
but
a
clear
*NL*
description
of
the
nature
of
the
one
,
you
may
form
a
pretty
exact
notion
*NL*
of
the
genius
and
character
of
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
Hobby-Horse
which
my
uncle
Toby
always
rode
upon
,
was
in
my
*NL*
opinion
an
Hobby-Horse
well
worth
giving
a
description
of
,
if
it
was
*NL*
only
upon
the
score
of
his
great
singularity
;
--
for
you
might
have
*NL*
travelled
from
York
to
Dover
,
--
from
Dover
to
Penzance
in
Cornwall
,
and
*NL*
from
Penzance
to
York
back
again
,
and
not
have
seen
such
another
upon
*NL*
the
road
;
or
if
you
had
seen
such
a
one
,
whatever
haste
you
had
been
in
,
*NL*
you
must
infallibly
have
stopp
'd
to
have
taken
a
view
of
him
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
the
gait
and
figure
of
him
was
so
strange
,
and
so
utterly
unlike
was
he
,
*NL*
from
his
head
to
his
tail
,
to
any
one
of
the
whole
species
,
that
it
*NL*
was
now
and
then
made
a
matter
of
dispute
,
--
whether
he
was
really
a
*NL*
Hobby-Horse
or
no
:
But
as
the
Philosopher
would
use
no
other
argument
to
*NL*
the
Sceptic
,
who
disputed
with
him
against
the
reality
of
motion
,
save
*NL*
that
of
rising
up
upon
his
legs
,
and
walking
across
the
room
;
--
so
would
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
use
no
other
argument
to
prove
his
Hobby-Horse
was
*NL*
a
Hobby-Horse
indeed
,
but
by
getting
upon
his
back
and
riding
him
*NL*
about
;
--
leaving
the
world
,
after
that
,
to
determine
the
point
as
it
*NL*
thought
fit
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
good
truth
,
my
uncle
Toby
mounted
him
with
so
much
pleasure
,
and
he
*NL*
carried
my
uncle
Toby
so
well
,
--
that
he
troubled
his
head
very
little
*NL*
with
what
the
world
either
said
or
thought
about

*NL*
The
wound
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
,
which
he
received
at
the
siege
of
*NL*
Namur
,
rendering
him
unfit
for
the
service
,
it
was
thought
expedient
he
*NL*
should
return
to
England
,
in
order
,
if
possible
,
to
be
set
to
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
four
years
totally
confined
,
--
part
of
it
to
his
bed
,
and
all
of
*NL*
it
to
his
room
:
and
in
the
course
of
his
cure
,
which
was
all
that
*NL*
time
in
hand
,
suffer
'd
unspeakable
miseries
,
--
owing
to
a
succession
of
*NL*
exfoliations
from
the
os
pubis
,
and
the
outward
edge
of
that
part
of
the
*NL*
coxendix
called
the
os
illium
,
--
both
which
bones
were
dismally
crush
'd
,
*NL*
as
much
by
the
irregularity
of
the
stone
,
which
I
told
you
was
broke
off
*NL*
the
parapet
,
--
as
by
its
size
,
--
-LRB-
tho
'
it
was
pretty
large
-RRB-
which
inclined
*NL*
the
surgeon
all
along
to
think
,
that
the
great
injury
which
it
had
*NL*
done
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
,
was
more
owing
to
the
gravity
of
the
stone
*NL*
itself
,
than
to
the
projectile
force
of
it
,
--
which
he
would
often
tell
*NL*
him
was
a
great
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
at
that
time
was
just
beginning
business
in
London
,
and
had
*NL*
taken
a
house
;
--
and
as
the
truest
friendship
and
cordiality
subsisted
*NL*
between
the
two
brothers
,
--
and
that
my
father
thought
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
could
no
where
be
so
well
nursed
and
taken
care
of
as
in
his
own
*NL*
house
,
--
he
assign
'd
him
the
very
best
apartment
in
it
.
--
And
what
was
a
*NL*
much
more
sincere
mark
of
his
affection
still
,
he
would
never
suffer
a
*NL*
friend
or
an
acquaintance
to
step
into
the
house
on
any
occasion
,
but
*NL*
he
would
take
him
by
the
hand
,
and
lead
him
up
stairs
to
see
his
brother
*NL*
Toby
,
and
chat
an
hour
by
his
bed-side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
of
a
soldier
's
wound
beguiles
the
pain
of
it
;
--
my
uncle
's
*NL*
visitors
at
least
thought
so
,
and
in
their
daily
calls
upon
him
,
from
*NL*
the
courtesy
arising
out
of
that
belief
,
they
would
frequently
turn
the
*NL*
discourse
to
that
subject
,
--
and
from
that
subject
the
discourse
would
*NL*
generally
roll
on
to
the
siege
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
conversations
were
infinitely
kind
;
and
my
uncle
Toby
received
*NL*
great
relief
from
them
,
and
would
have
received
much
more
,
but
that
they
*NL*
brought
him
into
some
unforeseen
perplexities
,
which
,
for
three
months
*NL*
together
,
retarded
his
cure
greatly
;
and
if
he
had
not
hit
upon
an
*NL*
expedient
to
extricate
himself
out
of
them
,
I
verily
believe
they
would
*NL*
have
laid
him
in
his
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
these
perplexities
of
my
uncle
Toby
were
,
--
't
is
impossible
for
you
*NL*
to
guess
;
--
if
you
could
,
--
I
should
blush
;
not
as
a
relation
,
--
not
as
a
*NL*
man
,
--
nor
even
as
a
woman
,
--
but
I
should
blush
as
an
author
;
inasmuch
*NL*
as
I
set
no
small
store
by
myself
upon
this
very
account
,
that
my
reader
*NL*
has
never
yet
been
able
to
guess
at
any
thing
.
And
in
this
,
Sir
,
I
am
*NL*
of
so
nice
and
singular
a
humour
,
that
if
I
thought
you
was
able
to
form
*NL*
the
least
judgment
or
probable
conjecture
to
yourself
,
of
what
was
to
*NL*
come
in
the
next
page
,
--
I
would
tear
it
out
of
my
book
.

.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
begun
a
new
book
,
on
purpose
that
I
might
have
room
enough
*NL*
to
explain
the
nature
of
the
perplexities
in
which
my
uncle
Toby
was
*NL*
involved
,
from
the
many
discourses
and
interrogations
about
the
siege
of
*NL*
Namur
,
where
he
received
his
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
remind
the
reader
,
in
case
he
has
read
the
history
of
King
*NL*
William
's
wars
,
--
but
if
he
has
not
,
--
I
then
inform
him
,
that
one
of
the
*NL*
most
memorable
attacks
in
that
siege
,
was
that
which
was
made
by
the
*NL*
English
and
Dutch
upon
the
point
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
,
between
*NL*
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
,
which
inclosed
the
great
sluice
or
water-stop
,
*NL*
where
the
English
were
terribly
exposed
to
the
shot
of
the
counter-guard
*NL*
and
demi-bastion
of
St.
Roch
:
The
issue
of
which
hot
dispute
,
in
*NL*
three
words
,
was
this
;
That
the
Dutch
lodged
themselves
upon
the
*NL*
counter-guard
,
--
and
that
the
English
made
themselves
masters
of
the
*NL*
covered-way
before
St.
Nicolas-gate
,
notwithstanding
the
gallantry
of
*NL*
the
French
officers
,
who
exposed
themselves
upon
the
glacis
sword
in
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
was
the
principal
attack
of
which
my
uncle
Toby
was
an
*NL*
eye-witness
at
Namur
,
--
the
army
of
the
besiegers
being
cut
off
,
by
the
*NL*
confluence
of
the
Maes
and
Sambre
,
from
seeing
much
of
each
other
's
*NL*
operations
,
--
my
uncle
Toby
was
generally
more
eloquent
and
particular
in
*NL*
his
account
of
it
;
and
the
many
perplexities
he
was
in
,
arose
out
of
*NL*
the
almost
insurmountable
difficulties
he
found
in
telling
his
story
*NL*
intelligibly
,
and
giving
such
clear
ideas
of
the
differences
and
*NL*
distinctions
between
the
scarp
and
counterscarp
,
--
the
glacis
and
*NL*
covered-way
,
--
the
half-moon
and
ravelin
,
--
as
to
make
his
company
fully
*NL*
comprehend
where
and
what
he
was
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Writers
themselves
are
too
apt
to
confound
these
terms
;
so
that
you
will
*NL*
the
less
wonder
,
if
in
his
endeavours
to
explain
them
,
and
in
opposition
*NL*
to
many
misconceptions
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
did
oft-times
puzzle
his
*NL*
visitors
,
and
sometimes
himself
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
speak
the
truth
,
unless
the
company
my
father
led
up
stairs
were
*NL*
tolerably
clear-headed
,
or
my
uncle
Toby
was
in
one
of
his
explanatory
*NL*
moods
,
't
was
a
difficult
thing
,
do
what
he
could
,
to
keep
the
discourse
*NL*
free
from
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
rendered
the
account
of
this
affair
the
more
intricate
to
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
,
was
this
,
--
that
in
the
attack
of
the
counterscarp
,
before
the
gate
*NL*
of
St.
Nicolas
,
extending
itself
from
the
bank
of
the
Maes
,
quite
up
*NL*
to
the
great
water-stop
,
--
the
ground
was
cut
and
cross
cut
with
such
a
*NL*
multitude
of
dykes
,
drains
,
rivulets
,
and
sluices
,
on
all
sides
,
--
and
*NL*
he
would
get
so
sadly
bewildered
,
and
set
fast
amongst
them
,
that
*NL*
frequently
he
could
neither
get
backwards
or
forwards
to
save
his
life
;
*NL*
and
was
oft-times
obliged
to
give
up
the
attack
upon
that
very
account
*NL*
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
perplexing
rebuffs
gave
my
uncle
Toby
Shandy
more
perturbations
*NL*
than
you
would
imagine
;
and
as
my
father
's
kindness
to
him
was
*NL*
continually
dragging
up
fresh
friends
and
fresh
enquirers
,
--
he
had
but
a
*NL*
very
uneasy
task
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
my
uncle
Toby
had
great
command
of
himself
,
--
and
could
guard
*NL*
appearances
,
I
believe
,
as
well
as
most
men
;
--
yet
any
one
may
imagine
,
*NL*
that
when
he
could
not
retreat
out
of
the
ravelin
without
getting
into
*NL*
the
half-moon
,
or
get
out
of
the
covered-way
without
falling
down
the
*NL*
counterscarp
,
nor
cross
the
dyke
without
danger
of
slipping
into
*NL*
the
ditch
,
but
that
he
must
have
fretted
and
fumed
inwardly
:
--
He
did
*NL*
so
;
--
and
the
little
and
hourly
vexations
,
which
may
seem
trifling
and
*NL*
of
no
account
to
the
man
who
has
not
read
Hippocrates
,
yet
,
whoever
has
*NL*
read
Hippocrates
,
or
Dr.
James
Mackenzie
,
and
has
considered
well
the
*NL*
effects
which
the
passions
and
affections
of
the
mind
have
upon
the
*NL*
digestion
--
-LRB-
Why
not
of
a
wound
as
well
as
of
a
dinner
?
-RRB-
--
may
easily
*NL*
conceive
what
sharp
paroxysms
and
exacerbations
of
his
wound
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
must
have
undergone
upon
that
score
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
uncle
Toby
could
not
philosophize
upon
it
;
--
't
was
enough
he
felt
*NL*
it
was
so
,
--
and
having
sustained
the
pain
and
sorrows
of
it
for
three
*NL*
months
together
,
he
was
resolved
some
way
or
other
to
extricate
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
one
morning
lying
upon
his
back
in
his
bed
,
the
anguish
and
*NL*
nature
of
the
wound
upon
his
groin
suffering
him
to
lie
in
no
other
*NL*
position
,
when
a
thought
came
into
his
head
,
that
if
he
could
purchase
*NL*
such
a
thing
,
and
have
it
pasted
down
upon
a
board
,
as
a
large
map
of
*NL*
the
fortification
of
the
town
and
citadel
of
Namur
,
with
its
environs
,
*NL*
it
might
be
a
means
of
giving
him
ease
.
--
I
take
notice
of
his
desire
*NL*
to
have
the
environs
along
with
the
town
and
citadel
,
for
this
*NL*
reason
,
--
because
my
uncle
Toby
's
wound
was
got
in
one
of
the
traverses
,
*NL*
about
thirty
toises
from
the
returning
angle
of
the
trench
,
opposite
*NL*
to
the
salient
angle
of
the
demi-bastion
of
St.
Roch
:
--
so
that
he
was
*NL*
pretty
confident
he
could
stick
a
pin
upon
the
identical
spot
of
ground
*NL*
where
he
was
standing
on
when
the
stone
struck
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
succeeded
to
his
wishes
,
and
not
only
freed
him
from
a
world
*NL*
of
sad
explanations
,
but
,
in
the
end
,
it
proved
the
happy
means
,
as
you
*NL*
will
read
,
of
procuring
my
uncle
Toby
his
Hobby-Horse

There
is
nothing
so
foolish
,
when
you
are
at
the
expence
of
making
an
*NL*
entertainment
of
this
kind
,
as
to
order
things
so
badly
,
as
to
let
your
*NL*
criticks
and
gentry
of
refined
taste
run
it
down
:
Nor
is
there
any
thing
*NL*
so
likely
to
make
them
do
it
,
as
that
of
leaving
them
out
of
the
party
,
*NL*
or
,
what
is
full
as
offensive
,
of
bestowing
your
attention
upon
the
rest
*NL*
of
your
guests
in
so
particular
a
way
,
as
if
there
was
no
such
thing
as
*NL*
a
critick
-LRB-
by
occupation
-RRB-
at
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
guard
against
both
;
for
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
have
left
half
a
*NL*
dozen
places
purposely
open
for
them
;
--
and
in
the
next
place
,
I
pay
them
*NL*
all
court
.
--
Gentlemen
,
I
kiss
your
hands
,
I
protest
no
company
could
*NL*
give
me
half
the
pleasure
,
--
by
my
soul
I
am
glad
to
see
you
--
I
beg
*NL*
only
you
will
make
no
strangers
of
yourselves
,
but
sit
down
without
any
*NL*
ceremony
,
and
fall
on
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
I
had
left
six
places
,
and
I
was
upon
the
point
of
carrying
my
*NL*
complaisance
so
far
,
as
to
have
left
a
seventh
open
for
them
,
--
and
in
*NL*
this
very
spot
I
stand
on
;
but
being
told
by
a
Critick
-LRB-
tho
'
not
by
*NL*
occupation
,
--
but
by
nature
-RRB-
that
I
had
acquitted
myself
well
enough
,
*NL*
I
shall
fill
it
up
directly
,
hoping
,
in
the
mean
time
,
that
I
shall
be
*NL*
able
to
make
a
great
deal
of
more
room
next
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
,
in
the
name
of
wonder
!
could
your
uncle
Toby
,
who
,
it
seems
,
was
*NL*
a
military
man
,
and
whom
you
have
represented
as
no
fool
,
--
be
at
the
*NL*
same
time
such
a
confused
,
pudding-headed
,
muddle-headed
,
fellow
,
as
--
Go
*NL*
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
Sir
Critick
,
I
could
have
replied
;
but
I
scorn
it
.
--
'T
is
language
*NL*
unurbane
,
--
and
only
befitting
the
man
who
can
not
give
clear
and
*NL*
satisfactory
accounts
of
things
,
or
dive
deep
enough
into
the
first
*NL*
causes
of
human
ignorance
and
confusion
.
It
is
moreover
the
reply
*NL*
valiant
--
and
therefore
I
reject
it
;
for
tho
'
it
might
have
suited
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
character
as
a
soldier
excellently
well
,
--
and
had
he
not
*NL*
accustomed
himself
,
in
such
attacks
,
to
whistle
the
Lillabullero
,
as
*NL*
he
wanted
no
courage
,
't
is
the
very
answer
he
would
have
given
;
yet
it
*NL*
would
by
no
means
have
done
for
me
.
You
see
as
plain
as
can
be
,
that
I
*NL*
write
as
a
man
of
erudition
;
--
that
even
my
similies
,
my
allusions
,
my
*NL*
illustrations
,
my
metaphors
,
are
erudite
,
--
and
that
I
must
sustain
*NL*
my
character
properly
,
and
contrast
it
properly
too
,
--
else
what
would
*NL*
become
of
me
?
Why
,
Sir
,
I
should
be
undone
;
--
at
this
very
moment
that
*NL*
I
am
going
here
to
fill
up
one
place
against
a
critick
,
--
I
should
have
*NL*
made
an
opening
for
a
couple
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Therefore
I
answer
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
Pray
,
Sir
,
in
all
the
reading
which
you
have
ever
read
,
did
you
ever
*NL*
read
such
a
book
as
Locke
's
Essay
upon
the
Human
Understanding
?
--
Do
n't
*NL*
answer
me
rashly
--
because
many
,
I
know
,
quote
the
book
,
who
have
not
*NL*
read
it
--
and
many
have
read
it
who
understand
it
not
:
--
If
either
of
*NL*
these
is
your
case
,
as
I
write
to
instruct
,
I
will
tell
you
in
three
*NL*
words
what
the
book
is
.
--
It
is
a
history
.
--
A
history
!
of
who
?
what
?
*NL*
where
?
when
?
Do
n't
hurry
yourself
--
It
is
a
history-book
,
Sir
,
-LRB-
which
may
*NL*
possibly
recommend
it
to
the
world
-RRB-
of
what
passes
in
a
man
's
own
mind
;
*NL*
and
if
you
will
say
so
much
of
the
book
,
and
no
more
,
believe
me
,
you
*NL*
will
cut
no
contemptible
figure
in
a
metaphysick
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
if
you
will
venture
to
go
along
with
me
,
and
look
down
into
the
*NL*
bottom
of
this
matter
,
it
will
be
found
that
the
cause
of
obscurity
and
*NL*
confusion
,
in
the
mind
of
a
man
,
is
threefold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dull
organs
,
dear
Sir
,
in
the
first
place
.
Secondly
,
slight
and
*NL*
transient
impressions
made
by
the
objects
,
when
the
said
organs
are
not
*NL*
dull
.
And
thirdly
,
a
memory
like
unto
a
sieve
,
not
able
to
retain
what
*NL*
it
has
received
.
--
Call
down
Dolly
your
chamber-maid
,
and
I
will
give
you
*NL*
my
cap
and
bell
along
with
it
,
if
I
make
not
this
matter
so
plain
that
*NL*
Dolly
herself
should
understand
it
as
well
as
Malbranch
.
--
When
Dolly
has
*NL*
indited
her
epistle
to
Robin
,
and
has
thrust
her
arm
into
the
bottom
*NL*
of
her
pocket
hanging
by
her
right
side
;
--
take
that
opportunity
to
*NL*
recollect
that
the
organs
and
faculties
of
perception
can
,
by
nothing
*NL*
in
this
world
,
be
so
aptly
typified
and
explained
as
by
that
one
thing
*NL*
which
Dolly
's
hand
is
in
search
of
.
--
Your
organs
are
not
so
dull
that
I
*NL*
should
inform
you
--
't
is
an
inch
,
Sir
,
of
red
seal-wax
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
is
melted
and
dropped
upon
the
letter
,
if
Dolly
fumbles
too
*NL*
long
for
her
thimble
,
till
the
wax
is
over
hardened
,
it
will
not
receive
*NL*
the
mark
of
her
thimble
from
the
usual
impulse
which
was
wont
to
imprint
*NL*
it
.
Very
well
.
If
Dolly
's
wax
,
for
want
of
better
,
is
bees-wax
,
or
of
a
*NL*
temper
too
soft
,
--
tho
'
it
may
receive
,
--
it
will
not
hold
the
impression
,
*NL*
how
hard
soever
Dolly
thrusts
against
it
;
and
last
of
all
,
supposing
the
*NL*
wax
good
,
and
eke
the
thimble
,
but
applied
thereto
in
careless
haste
,
as
*NL*
her
Mistress
rings
the
bell
;
--
in
any
one
of
these
three
cases
the
print
*NL*
left
by
the
thimble
will
be
as
unlike
the
prototype
as
a
brass-jack
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
you
must
understand
that
not
one
of
these
was
the
true
cause
of
the
*NL*
confusion
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
discourse
;
and
it
is
for
that
very
reason
*NL*
I
enlarge
upon
them
so
long
,
after
the
manner
of
great
physiologists
--
to
*NL*
shew
the
world
,
what
it
did
not
arise
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
it
did
arise
from
,
I
have
hinted
above
,
and
a
fertile
source
of
*NL*
obscurity
it
is
,
--
and
ever
will
be
,
--
and
that
is
the
unsteady
uses
*NL*
of
words
,
which
have
perplexed
the
clearest
and
most
exalted
*NL*
understandings
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
ten
to
one
-LRB-
at
Arthur
's
-RRB-
whether
you
have
ever
read
the
literary
*NL*
histories
of
past
ages
;
--
if
you
have
,
what
terrible
battles
,
`
yclept
*NL*
logomachies
,
have
they
occasioned
and
perpetuated
with
so
much
gall
*NL*
and
ink-shed
,
--
that
a
good-natured
man
can
not
read
the
accounts
of
them
*NL*
without
tears
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gentle
critick
!
when
thou
hast
weighed
all
this
,
and
considered
within
*NL*
thyself
how
much
of
thy
own
knowledge
,
discourse
,
and
conversation
has
*NL*
been
pestered
and
disordered
,
at
one
time
or
other
,
by
this
,
and
this
*NL*
only
:
--
What
a
pudder
and
racket
in
Councils
about
-LRB-
Greek
-RRB-
;
and
in
the
*NL*
Schools
of
the
learned
about
power
and
about
spirit
;
--
about
essences
,
*NL*
and
about
quintessences
;
--
about
substances
,
and
about
space
.
--
What
*NL*
confusion
in
greater
Theatres
from
words
of
little
meaning
,
and
as
*NL*
indeterminate
a
sense
!
when
thou
considerest
this
,
thou
wilt
not
wonder
*NL*
at
my
uncle
Toby
's
perplexities
,
--
thou
wilt
drop
a
tear
of
pity
upon
*NL*
his
scarp
and
his
counterscarp
;
--
his
glacis
and
his
covered
way
;
--
his
*NL*
ravelin
and
his
half-moon
:
'T
was
not
by
ideas
,
--
by
Heaven
;
his
life
was
*NL*
put
in
jeopardy
by
words
.

*NL*
*NL*
When
my
uncle
Toby
got
his
map
of
Namur
to
his
mind
,
he
began
*NL*
immediately
to
apply
himself
,
and
with
the
utmost
diligence
,
to
the
*NL*
study
of
it
;
for
nothing
being
of
more
importance
to
him
than
his
*NL*
recovery
,
and
his
recovery
depending
,
as
you
have
read
,
upon
the
*NL*
passions
and
affections
of
his
mind
,
it
behoved
him
to
take
the
nicest
*NL*
care
to
make
himself
so
far
master
of
his
subject
,
as
to
be
able
to
talk
*NL*
upon
it
without
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
fortnight
's
close
and
painful
application
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
did
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
wound
,
upon
his
groin
,
no
good
,
--
he
was
enabled
,
by
the
*NL*
help
of
some
marginal
documents
at
the
feet
of
the
elephant
,
together
*NL*
with
Gobesius
's
military
architecture
and
pyroballogy
,
translated
from
*NL*
the
Flemish
,
to
form
his
discourse
with
passable
perspicuity
;
and
before
*NL*
he
was
two
full
months
gone
,
--
he
was
right
eloquent
upon
it
,
and
*NL*
could
make
not
only
the
attack
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
with
great
*NL*
order
;
--
but
having
,
by
that
time
,
gone
much
deeper
into
the
art
,
than
*NL*
what
his
first
motive
made
necessary
,
my
uncle
Toby
was
able
to
cross
*NL*
the
Maes
and
Sambre
;
make
diversions
as
far
as
Vauban
's
line
,
the
abbey
*NL*
of
Salsines
,
&
c.
and
give
his
visitors
as
distinct
a
history
of
each
of
*NL*
their
attacks
,
as
of
that
of
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
,
where
he
had
the
*NL*
honour
to
receive
his
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
desire
of
knowledge
,
like
the
thirst
of
riches
,
increases
ever
with
*NL*
the
acquisition
of
it
.
The
more
my
uncle
Toby
pored
over
his
map
,
*NL*
the
more
he
took
a
liking
to
it
!
--
by
the
same
process
and
electrical
*NL*
assimilation
,
as
I
told
you
,
through
which
I
ween
the
souls
of
*NL*
connoisseurs
themselves
,
by
long
friction
and
incumbition
,
have
the
*NL*
happiness
,
at
length
,
to
get
all
be-virtu
'd
--
be-pictured
,
--
be
-
*NL*
butterflied
,
and
be-fiddled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
my
uncle
Toby
drank
of
this
sweet
fountain
of
science
,
the
*NL*
greater
was
the
heat
and
impatience
of
his
thirst
,
so
that
before
the
*NL*
first
year
of
his
confinement
had
well
gone
round
,
there
was
scarce
a
*NL*
fortified
town
in
Italy
or
Flanders
,
of
which
,
by
one
means
or
other
,
*NL*
he
had
not
procured
a
plan
,
reading
over
as
he
got
them
,
and
carefully
*NL*
collating
therewith
the
histories
of
their
sieges
,
their
demolitions
,
*NL*
their
improvements
,
and
new
works
,
all
which
he
would
read
with
that
*NL*
intense
application
and
delight
,
that
he
would
forget
himself
,
his
*NL*
wound
,
his
confinement
,
his
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
year
my
uncle
Toby
purchased
Ramelli
and
Cataneo
,
*NL*
translated
from
the
Italian
;
--
likewise
Stevinus
,
Moralis
,
the
Chevalier
*NL*
de
Ville
,
Lorini
,
Cochorn
,
Sheeter
,
the
Count
de
Pagan
,
the
Marshal
*NL*
Vauban
,
Mons
.
Blondel
,
with
almost
as
many
more
books
of
military
*NL*
architecture
,
as
Don
Quixote
was
found
to
have
of
chivalry
,
when
the
*NL*
curate
and
barber
invaded
his
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
beginning
of
the
third
year
,
which
was
in
August
,
*NL*
ninety-nine
,
my
uncle
Toby
found
it
necessary
to
understand
a
little
of
*NL*
projectiles
:
--
and
having
judged
it
best
to
draw
his
knowledge
from
the
*NL*
fountain-head
,
he
began
with
N.
Tartaglia
,
who
it
seems
was
the
first
*NL*
man
who
detected
the
imposition
of
a
cannon-ball
's
doing
all
that
*NL*
mischief
under
the
notion
of
a
right
line
--
This
N.
Tartaglia
proved
to
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
to
be
an
impossible
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Endless
is
the
search
of
Truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
was
my
uncle
Toby
satisfied
which
road
the
cannon-ball
did
not
*NL*
go
,
but
he
was
insensibly
led
on
,
and
resolved
in
his
mind
to
enquire
*NL*
and
find
out
which
road
the
ball
did
go
:
For
which
purpose
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
set
off
afresh
with
old
Maltus
,
and
studied
him
devoutly
.
--
He
*NL*
proceeded
next
to
Galileo
and
Torricellius
,
wherein
,
by
certain
*NL*
Geometrical
rules
,
infallibly
laid
down
,
he
found
the
precise
path
to
*NL*
be
a
Parabola
--
or
else
an
Hyperbola
,
--
and
that
the
parameter
,
or
latus
*NL*
rectum
,
of
the
conic
section
of
the
said
path
,
was
to
the
quantity
and
*NL*
amplitude
in
a
direct
ratio
,
as
the
whole
line
to
the
sine
of
double
the
*NL*
angle
of
incidence
,
formed
by
the
breech
upon
an
horizontal
plane
;
--
and
*NL*
that
the
semiparameter
,
--
stop
!
my
dear
uncle
Toby
--
stop
!
--
go
not
one
*NL*
foot
farther
into
this
thorny
and
bewildered
track
,
--
intricate
are
the
*NL*
steps
!
intricate
are
the
mazes
of
this
labyrinth
!
intricate
are
the
*NL*
troubles
which
the
pursuit
of
this
bewitching
phantom
Knowledge
*NL*
will
bring
upon
thee
.
--
O
my
uncle
;
--
fly
--
fly
,
--
fly
from
it
as
from
a
*NL*
serpent
.
--
Is
it
fit
--
goodnatured
man
!
thou
should
`
st
sit
up
,
with
*NL*
the
wound
upon
thy
groin
,
whole
nights
baking
thy
blood
with
*NL*
hectic
watchings
?
--
Alas
!
`
twill
exasperate
thy
symptoms
,
--
check
thy
*NL*
perspirations
--
evaporate
thy
spirits
--
waste
thy
animal
strength
,
dry
up
*NL*
thy
radical
moisture
,
bring
thee
into
a
costive
habit
of
body
,
--
impair
*NL*
thy
health
,

and
hasten
all
the
infirmities
of
thy

*NL*
*NL*
I
would
not
give
a
groat
for
that
man
's
knowledge
in
pen-craft
,
who
does
*NL*
not
understand
this
,
--
That
the
best
plain
narrative
in
the
world
,
tacked
*NL*
very
close
to
the
last
spirited
apostrophe
to
my
uncle
Toby
--
would
*NL*
have
felt
both
cold
and
vapid
upon
the
reader
's
palate
;
--
therefore
I
*NL*
forthwith
put
an
end
to
the
chapter
,
though
I
was
in
the
middle
of
my
*NL*
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Writers
of
my
stamp
have
one
principle
in
common
with
painters
.
Where
*NL*
an
exact
copying
makes
our
pictures
less
striking
,
we
choose
the
less
*NL*
evil
;
deeming
it
even
more
pardonable
to
trespass
against
truth
,
than
*NL*
beauty
.
This
is
to
be
understood
cum
grano
salis
;
but
be
it
as
it
*NL*
will
,
--
as
the
parallel
is
made
more
for
the
sake
of
letting
the
*NL*
apostrophe
cool
,
than
any
thing
else
,
--
't
is
not
very
material
whether
*NL*
upon
any
other
score
the
reader
approves
of
it
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
latter
end
of
the
third
year
,
my
uncle
Toby
perceiving
that
the
*NL*
parameter
and
semi-parameter
of
the
conic
section
angered
his
wound
,
*NL*
he
left
off
the
study
of
projectiles
in
a
kind
of
a
huff
,
and
betook
*NL*
himself
to
the
practical
part
of
fortification
only
;
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
which
,
like
a
spring
held
back
,
returned
upon
him
with
redoubled
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
this
year
that
my
uncle
began
to
break
in
upon
the
daily
*NL*
regularity
of
a
clean
shirt
,
--
to
dismiss
his
barber
unshaven
,
--
and
to
*NL*
allow
his
surgeon
scarce
time
sufficient
to
dress
his
wound
,
concerning
*NL*
himself
so
little
about
it
,
as
not
to
ask
him
once
in
seven
times
*NL*
dressing
,
how
it
went
on
:
when
,
lo
!
--
all
of
a
sudden
,
for
the
change
*NL*
was
quick
as
lightning
,
he
began
to
sigh
heavily
for
his
*NL*
recovery
,
--
complained
to
my
father
,
grew
impatient
with
the
*NL*
surgeon
:
--
and
one
morning
,
as
he
heard
his
foot
coming
up
stairs
,
*NL*
he
shut
up
his
books
,
and
thrust
aside
his
instruments
,
in
order
to
*NL*
expostulate
with
him
upon
the
protraction
of
the
cure
,
which
,
he
told
*NL*
him
,
might
surely
have
been
accomplished
at
least
by
that
time
:
--
He
*NL*
dwelt
long
upon
the
miseries
he
had
undergone
,
and
the
sorrows
of
his
*NL*
four
years
melancholy
imprisonment
;
--
adding
,
that
had
it
not
been
for
*NL*
the
kind
looks
and
fraternal
chearings
of
the
best
of
brothers
,
--
he
*NL*
had
long
since
sunk
under
his
misfortunes
.
--
My
father
was
by
.
My
uncle
*NL*
Toby
's
eloquence
brought
tears
into
his
eyes
;
--
't
was
unexpected
:
--
My
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
by
nature
was
not
eloquent
;
--
it
had
the
greater
effect
:
--
The
*NL*
surgeon
was
confounded
;
--
not
that
there
wanted
grounds
for
such
,
or
*NL*
greater
marks
of
impatience
,
--
but
't
was
unexpected
too
;
in
the
four
*NL*
years
he
had
attended
him
,
he
had
never
seen
any
thing
like
it
in
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
carriage
;
he
had
never
once
dropped
one
fretful
or
*NL*
discontented
word
;
--
he
had
been
all
patience
,
--
all
submission
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
lose
the
right
of
complaining
sometimes
by
forbearing
it
;
--
but
we
*NL*
often
treble
the
force
:
--
The
surgeon
was
astonished
;
but
much
more
so
,
*NL*
when
he
heard
my
uncle
Toby
go
on
,
and
peremptorily
insist
upon
his
*NL*
healing
up
the
wound
directly
,
--
or
sending
for
Monsieur
Ronjat
,
the
*NL*
king
's
serjeant-surgeon
,
to
do
it
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
desire
of
life
and
health
is
implanted
in
man
's
nature
;
--
the
love
of
*NL*
liberty
and
enlargement
is
a
sister-passion
to
it
:
These
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
had
in
common
with
his
species
--
and
either
of
them
had
been
sufficient
*NL*
to
account
for
his
earnest
desire
to
get
well
and
out
of
doors
;
--
but
*NL*
I
have
told
you
before
,
that
nothing
wrought
with
our
family
after
the
*NL*
common
way
;
--
and
from
the
time
and
manner
in
which
this
eager
desire
*NL*
shewed
itself
in
the
present
case
,
the
penetrating
reader
will
suspect
*NL*
there
was
some
other
cause
or
crotchet
for
it
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
head
:
--
There
was
so
,
and
't
is
the
subject
of
the
next
chapter
to
set
*NL*
forth
what
that
cause
and
crotchet
was
.
I
own
,
when
that
's
done
,
`
twill
*NL*
be
time
to
return
back
to
the
parlour
fire-side
,
where
we
left
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
in
the
middle
of
his
sentence
.

XXX
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
man
gives
himself
up
to
the
government
of
a
ruling
passion
,
--
or
,
*NL*
in
other
words
,
when
his
Hobby-Horse
grows
headstrong
,
--
farewell
cool
*NL*
reason
and
fair
discretion
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
's
wound
was
near
well
,
and
as
soon
as
the
surgeon
*NL*
recovered
his
surprize
,
and
could
get
leave
to
say
as
much
--
he
told
*NL*
him
,
't
was
just
beginning
to
incarnate
;
and
that
if
no
fresh
exfoliation
*NL*
happened
,
which
there
was
no
sign
of
,
--
it
would
be
dried
up
in
five
or
*NL*
six
weeks
.
The
sound
of
as
many
Olympiads
,
twelve
hours
before
,
would
*NL*
have
conveyed
an
idea
of
shorter
duration
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
.
--
The
*NL*
succession
of
his
ideas
was
now
rapid
,
--
he
broiled
with
impatience
to
*NL*
put
his
design
in
execution
;
--
and
so
,
without
consulting
farther
with
*NL*
any
soul
living
,
--
which
,
by
the
bye
,
I
think
is
right
,
when
you
are
*NL*
predetermined
to
take
no
one
soul
's
advice
,
--
he
privately
ordered
*NL*
Trim
,
his
man
,
to
pack
up
a
bundle
of
lint
and
dressings
,
and
hire
a
*NL*
chariot-and-four
to
be
at
the
door
exactly
by
twelve
o'clock
that
day
,
*NL*
when
he
knew
my
father
would
be
upon
`
Change
.
--
So
leaving
a
bank-note
*NL*
upon
the
table
for
the
surgeon
's
care
of
him
,
and
a
letter
of
*NL*
tender
thanks
for
his
brother
's
--
he
packed
up
his
maps
,
his
books
of
*NL*
fortification
,
his
instruments
,
&
c.
and
by
the
help
of
a
crutch
on
one
*NL*
side
,
and
Trim
on
the
other
,
--
my
uncle
Toby
embarked
for
Shandy-Hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reason
,
or
rather
the
rise
of
this
sudden
demigration
was
as
*NL*
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
table
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
room
,
and
at
which
,
the
night
before
this
*NL*
change
happened
,
he
was
sitting
with
his
maps
,
&
c.
about
him
--
being
*NL*
somewhat
of
the
smallest
,
for
that
infinity
of
great
and
small
*NL*
instruments
of
knowledge
which
usually
lay
crowded
upon
it
--
he
had
*NL*
the
accident
,
in
reaching
over
for
his
tobacco-box
,
to
throw
down
his
*NL*
compasses
,
and
in
stooping
to
take
the
compasses
up
,
with
his
sleeve
he
*NL*
threw
down
his
case
of
instruments
and
snuffers
;
--
and
as
the
dice
took
*NL*
a
run
against
him
,
in
his
endeavouring
to
catch
the
snuffers
in
*NL*
falling
,
--
he
thrust
Monsieur
Blondel
off
the
table
,
and
Count
de
Pagon
*NL*
o'top
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
to
no
purpose
for
a
man
,
lame
as
my
uncle
Toby
was
,
to
think
*NL*
of
redressing
these
evils
by
himself
,
--
he
rung
his
bell
for
his
man
*NL*
Trim
;
--
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
prithee
see
what
confusion
I
have
here
*NL*
been
making
--
I
must
have
some
better
contrivance
,
Trim
.
--
Can
`
st
not
thou
*NL*
take
my
rule
,
and
measure
the
length
and
breadth
of
this
table
,
and
*NL*
then
go
and
bespeak
me
one
as
big
again
?
--
Yes
,
an
'
please
your
Honour
,
*NL*
replied
Trim
,
making
a
bow
;
but
I
hope
your
Honour
will
be
soon
well
*NL*
enough
to
get
down
to
your
country-seat
,
where
,
--
as
your
Honour
takes
so
*NL*
much
pleasure
in
fortification
,
we
could
manage
this
matter
to
a
T.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
here
inform
you
,
that
this
servant
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
who
went
*NL*
by
the
name
of
Trim
,
had
been
a
corporal
in
my
uncle
's
own
company
,
--
his
*NL*
real
name
was
James
Butler
,
--
but
having
got
the
nick-name
of
Trim
,
in
*NL*
the
regiment
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
unless
when
he
happened
to
be
very
angry
*NL*
with
him
,
would
never
call
him
by
any
other
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
fellow
had
been
disabled
for
the
service
,
by
a
wound
on
his
*NL*
left
knee
by
a
musket-bullet
,
at
the
battle
of
Landen
,
which
was
two
*NL*
years
before
the
affair
of
Namur
;
--
and
as
the
fellow
was
well-beloved
*NL*
in
the
regiment
,
and
a
handy
fellow
into
the
bargain
,
my
uncle
Toby
took
*NL*
him
for
his
servant
;
and
of
an
excellent
use
was
he
,
attending
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
in
the
camp
and
in
his
quarters
as
a
valet
,
groom
,
barber
,
cook
,
*NL*
sempster
,
and
nurse
;
and
indeed
,
from
first
to
last
,
waited
upon
him
and
*NL*
served
him
with
great
fidelity
and
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
loved
the
man
in
return
,
and
what
attached
him
more
to
him
*NL*
still
,
was
the
similitude
of
their
knowledge
.
--
For
Corporal
Trim
,
-LRB-
for
*NL*
so
,
for
the
future
,
I
shall
call
him
-RRB-
by
four
years
occasional
attention
*NL*
to
his
Master
's
discourse
upon
fortified
towns
,
and
the
advantage
of
*NL*
prying
and
peeping
continually
into
his
Master
's
plans
,
&
c.
exclusive
*NL*
and
besides
what
he
gained
Hobby-Horsically
,
as
a
body-servant
,
Non
*NL*
Hobby
Horsical
per
se
;
--
had
become
no
mean
proficient
in
the
science
;
*NL*
and
was
thought
,
by
the
cook
and
chamber-maid
,
to
know
as
much
of
the
*NL*
nature
of
strong-holds
as
my
uncle
Toby
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
but
one
more
stroke
to
give
to
finish
Corporal
Trim
's
*NL*
character
,
--
and
it
is
the
only
dark
line
in
it
.
--
The
fellow
loved
to
*NL*
advise
,
--
or
rather
to
hear
himself
talk
;
his
carriage
,
however
,
was
so
*NL*
perfectly
respectful
,
't
was
easy
to
keep
him
silent
when
you
had
him
*NL*
so
;
but
set
his
tongue
a-going
,
--
you
had
no
hold
of
him
--
he
was
*NL*
voluble
;
--
the
eternal
interlardings
of
your
Honour
,
with
the
*NL*
respectfulness
of
Corporal
Trim
's
manner
,
interceding
so
strong
*NL*
in
behalf
of
his
elocution
,
--
that
though
you
might
have
been
*NL*
incommoded
,
--
you
could
not
well
be
angry
.
My
uncle
Toby
was
seldom
*NL*
either
the
one
or
the
other
with
him
,
--
or
,
at
least
,
this
fault
,
in
*NL*
Trim
,
broke
no
squares
with
them
.
My
uncle
Toby
,
as
I
said
,
loved
the
*NL*
man
;
--
and
besides
,
as
he
ever
looked
upon
a
faithful
servant
,
--
but
as
an
*NL*
humble
friend
,
--
he
could
not
bear
to
stop
his
mouth
.
--
Such
was
Corporal
*NL*
Trim
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
durst
presume
,
continued
Trim
,
to
give
your
Honour
my
advice
,
and
*NL*
speak
my
opinion
in
this
matter
.
--
Thou
art
welcome
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
--
speak
,
--
speak
what
thou
thinkest
upon
the
subject
,
man
,
without
*NL*
fear
.
--
Why
then
,
replied
Trim
,
-LRB-
not
hanging
his
ears
and
scratching
his
*NL*
head
like
a
country-lout
,
but
-RRB-
stroking
his
hair
back
from
his
forehead
,
*NL*
and
standing
erect
as
before
his
division
,
--
I
think
,
quoth
Trim
,
*NL*
advancing
his
left
,
which
was
his
lame
leg
,
a
little
forwards
,
--
and
*NL*
pointing
with
his
right
hand
open
towards
a
map
of
Dunkirk
,
which
was
*NL*
pinned
against
the
hangings
,
--
I
think
,
quoth
Corporal
Trim
,
with
humble
*NL*
submission
to
your
Honour
's
better
judgment
,
--
that
these
ravelins
,
*NL*
bastions
,
curtins
,
and
hornworks
,
make
but
a
poor
,
contemptible
,
*NL*
fiddle-faddle
piece
of
work
of
it
here
upon
paper
,
compared
to
what
your
*NL*
Honour
and
I
could
make
of
it
were
we
in
the
country
by
ourselves
,
and
*NL*
had
but
a
rood
,
or
a
rood
and
a
half
of
ground
to
do
what
we
pleased
*NL*
with
:
As
summer
is
coming
on
,
continued
Trim
,
your
Honour
might
sit
*NL*
out
of
doors
,
and
give
me
the
nography
--
-LRB-
Call
it
ichnography
,
quoth
my
*NL*
uncle
,
-RRB-
--
of
the
town
or
citadel
,
your
Honour
was
pleased
to
sit
down
*NL*
before
,
--
and
I
will
be
shot
by
your
Honour
upon
the
glacis
of
it
,
if
*NL*
I
did
not
fortify
it
to
your
Honour
's
mind
.
--
I
dare
say
thou
would
`
st
,
*NL*
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
.
--
For
if
your
Honour
,
continued
the
Corporal
,
could
*NL*
but
mark
me
the
polygon
,
with
its
exact
lines
and
angles
--
That
I
could
*NL*
do
very
well
,
quoth
my
uncle
.
--
I
would
begin
with
the
fosse
,
and
if
your
*NL*
Honour
could
tell
me
the
proper
depth
and
breadth
--
I
can
to
a
hair
's
*NL*
breadth
,
Trim
,
replied
my
uncle
.
--
I
would
throw
out
the
earth
upon
*NL*
this
hand
towards
the
town
for
the
scarp
,
--
and
on
that
hand
towards
*NL*
the
campaign
for
the
counterscarp
.
--
Very
right
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
:
--
And
when
I
had
sloped
them
to
your
mind
,
--
an
'
please
your
Honour
,
*NL*
I
would
face
the
glacis
,
as
the
finest
fortifications
are
done
in
*NL*
Flanders
,
with
sods
,
--
and
as
your
Honour
knows
they
should
be
,
--
and
I
*NL*
would
make
the
walls
and
parapets
with
sods
too
.
--
The
best
engineers
*NL*
call
them
gazons
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
Whether
they
are
gazons
or
*NL*
sods
,
is
not
much
matter
,
replied
Trim
;
your
Honour
knows
they
are
ten
*NL*
times
beyond
a
facing
either
of
brick
or
stone
.
--
I
know
they
are
,
*NL*
Trim
in
some
respects
,
--
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
nodding
his
head
;
--
for
a
*NL*
cannon-ball
enters
into
the
gazon
right
onwards
,
without
bringing
any
*NL*
rubbish
down
with
it
,
which
might
fill
the
fosse
,
-LRB-
as
was
the
case
at
*NL*
St.
Nicolas
's
gate
-RRB-
and
facilitate
the
passage
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
Honour
understands
these
matters
,
replied
Corporal
Trim
,
better
*NL*
than
any
officer
in
his
Majesty
's
service
;
--
but
would
your
Honour
please
*NL*
to
let
the
bespeaking
of
the
table
alone
,
and
let
us
but
go
into
the
*NL*
country
,
I
would
work
under
your
Honour
's
directions
like
a
horse
,
*NL*
and
make
fortifications
for
you
something
like
a
tansy
,
with
all
their
*NL*
batteries
,
saps
,
ditches
,
and
palisadoes
,
that
it
should
be
worth
all
*NL*
the
world
's
riding
twenty
miles
to
go
and
see
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
blushed
as
red
as
scarlet
as
Trim
went
on
;
--
but
it
was
not
*NL*
a
blush
of
guilt
,
--
of
modesty
,
--
or
of
anger
,
--
it
was
a
blush
of
joy
;
--
he
*NL*
was
fired
with
Corporal
Trim
's
project
and
description
.
--
Trim
!
said
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
,
thou
hast
said
enough
.
--
We
might
begin
the
campaign
,
*NL*
continued
Trim
,
on
the
very
day
that
his
Majesty
and
the
Allies
take
the
*NL*
field
,
and
demolish
them
town
by
town
as
fast
as
--
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
,
say
no
more
.
Your
Honour
,
continued
Trim
,
might
sit
in
your
*NL*
arm-chair
-LRB-
pointing
to
it
-RRB-
this
fine
weather
,
giving
me
your
orders
,
and
*NL*
I
would
--
Say
no
more
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
--
Besides
,
your
Honour
*NL*
would
get
not
only
pleasure
and
good
pastime
--
but
good
air
,
and
good
*NL*
exercise
,
and
good
health
,
--
and
your
Honour
's
wound
would
be
well
in
a
*NL*
month
.
Thou
hast
said
enough
,
Trim
,
--
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
-LRB-
putting
his
*NL*
hand
into
his
breeches-pocket
-RRB-
--
I
like
thy
project
mightily
.
--
And
if
*NL*
your
Honour
pleases
,
I
'll
this
moment
go
and
buy
a
pioneer
's
spade
*NL*
to
take
down
with
us
,
and
I
'll
bespeak
a
shovel
and
a
pick-axe
,
and
a
*NL*
couple
of

Say
no

,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
leaping
up
upon
one
*NL*
leg
,
quite
overcome
with
rapture
,
--
and
thrusting
a
guinea
into
Trim
's
*NL*
hand
,
--
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
say
no
more
;
--
but
go
down
,
Trim
,
this
*NL*
moment
,
my
lad
,
and
bring
up
my
supper
this
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Trim
ran
down
and
brought
up
his
master
's
supper
,
--
to
no
*NL*
purpose
:
--
Trim
's
plan
of
operation
ran
so
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
head
,
he
*NL*
could
not
taste
it
.
--
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
get
me
to
bed
.
--
'T
was
*NL*
all
one
.
--
Corporal
Trim
's
description
had
fired
his
imagination
,
--
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
could
not
shut
his
eyes
.
--
The
more
he
considered
it
,
the
more
*NL*
bewitching
the
scene
appeared
to
him
;
--
so
that
,
two
full
hours
before
*NL*
day-light
,
he
had
come
to
a
final
determination
and
had
concerted
the
*NL*
whole
plan
of
his
and
Corporal
Trim
's
decampment
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
had
a
little
neat
country-house
of
his
own
,
in
the
village
*NL*
where
my
father
's
estate
lay
at
Shandy
,
which
had
been
left
him
by
*NL*
an
old
uncle
,
with
a
small
estate
of
about
one
hundred
pounds
a-year
.
*NL*
Behind
this
house
,
and
contiguous
to
it
,
was
a
kitchen-garden
of
about
*NL*
half
an
acre
,
and
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
,
and
cut
off
from
it
by
*NL*
a
tall
yew
hedge
,
was
a
bowling-green
,
containing
just
about
as
much
*NL*
ground
as
Corporal
Trim
wished
for
;
--
so
that
as
Trim
uttered
the
*NL*
words
,
'
A
rood
and
a
half
of
ground
to
do
what
they
would
with
,
'
--
this
*NL*
identical
bowling-green
instantly
presented
itself
,
and
became
curiously
*NL*
painted
all
at
once
,
upon
the
retina
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
fancy
;
--
which
*NL*
was
the
physical
cause
of
making
him
change
colour
,
or
at
least
of
*NL*
heightening
his
blush
,
to
that
immoderate
degree
I
spoke
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
did
lover
post
down
to
a
beloved
mistress
with
more
heat
and
*NL*
expectation
,
than
my
uncle
Toby
did
,
to
enjoy
this
self-same
thing
in
*NL*
private
;
--
I
say
in
private
;
--
for
it
was
sheltered
from
the
house
,
as
I
*NL*
told
you
,
by
a
tall
yew
hedge
,
and
was
covered
on
the
other
three
sides
,
*NL*
from
mortal
sight
,
by
rough
holly
and
thick-set
flowering
shrubs
:
--
so
*NL*
that
the
idea
of
not
being
seen
,
did
not
a
little
contribute
to
the
*NL*
idea
of
pleasure
pre-conceived
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
.
--
Vain
thought
!
*NL*
however
thick
it
was
planted
about
,
--
or
private
soever
it
might
*NL*
seem
,
--
to
think
,
dear
uncle
Toby
,
of
enjoying
a
thing
which
took
up
a
*NL*
whole
rood
and
a
half
of
ground
,
--
and
not
have
it
known
!
*NL*
*NL*
How
my
uncle
Toby
and
Corporal
Trim
managed
this
matter
,
--
with
the
*NL*
history
of
their
campaigns
,
which
were
no
way
barren
of
events
,
--
may
*NL*
make
no
uninteresting
under-plot
in
the
epitasis
and
working-up
of
this
*NL*
drama
.
--
At
present
the
scene
must
drop
,

and
change
for
the
parlour

fire-side

brother

said
my

.

I
think
,
replied
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
taking
,
as
I
told
you
,
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
and
*NL*
striking
the
ashes
out
of
it
as
he
began
his

;

I

,
replied
*NL*
he
,

it
would
not
be
amiss

if

rung

,
what
's
all
that

over

Obadiah

quoth
my

father
;

my
brother
and
I
can
scarce
hear
ourselves
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
,
answered
Obadiah
,
making
a
bow
towards
his
left
shoulder
,
--
my
*NL*
Mistress
is
taken
very
badly
.
--
And
where
's
Susannah
running
down
the
*NL*
garden
there
,
as
if
they
were
going
to
ravish
her
?
--
Sir
,
she
is
running
*NL*
the
shortest
cut
into
the
town
,
replied
Obadiah
,
to
fetch
the
old
*NL*
midwife
.
--
Then
saddle
a
horse
,
quoth
my
father
,
and
do
you
go
directly
*NL*
for
Dr.
Slop
,
the
man-midwife
,
with
all
our
services
,
--
and
let
him
know
*NL*
your
mistress
is
fallen
into
labour
--
and
that
I
desire
he
will
return
*NL*
with
you
with
all
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
very
strange
,
says
my
father
,
addressing
himself
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
as
Obadiah
shut
the
door
,
--
as
there
is
so
expert
an
operator
as
Dr.
Slop
*NL*
so
near
,
--
that
my
wife
should
persist
to
the
very
last
in
this
obstinate
*NL*
humour
of
hers
,
in
trusting
the
life
of
my
child
,
who
has
had
one
*NL*
misfortune
already
,
to
the
ignorance
of
an
old
woman
;
--
and
not
only
the
*NL*
life
of
my
child
,
brother
,
--
but
her
own
life
,
and
with
it
the
lives
of
*NL*
all
the
children
I
might
,
peradventure
,
have
begot
out
of
her
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mayhap

replied
my

Toby

my
sister
does
it
to
save
the
*NL*
expence
:

A
pudding

replied
my

,
--
the
Doctor
must
be
paid
*NL*
the
same
for
inaction
as
action
,
--
if
not
better
,

to
keep
him
in

Then
it
can
be
out

my

*NL*
in

Modesty

My

I
dare
say
,
*NL*
added
he
,
does
not
care
to
let
a
man
come
so
near
her
...
I
will
not
say
*NL*
whether
my
uncle
Toby
had
completed
the
sentence
or
not
;
--
't
is
for
his
*NL*
advantage
to
suppose
he
had
,
--
as
,
I
think
,
he
could
have
added
no
One
*NL*
Word
which
would
have
improved
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
on
the
contrary
,
my
uncle
Toby
had
not
fully
arrived
at
the
period

*NL*
end
--
then
the
world
stands
indebted
to
the
sudden
snapping
of
my
*NL*
father
's
tobacco-pipe
for
one
of
the
neatest
examples
of
that
ornamental
*NL*
figure
in
oratory
,
which
Rhetoricians
stile

Aposiopesis

Just
*NL*
Heaven

the
Poco

the
Poco

artists
;
--
the
insensible
more

less
,
determine
the
precise
line
of
*NL*
beauty
in

as
well
as
in

How
do
the
slight
*NL*
touches
of

caetera
,

O

never

O

never

small

your

I
dare

ran
so
much
in

that

of

Tho
'
my
father
was
a
good
natural
philosopher
,
--
yet
he
was
something
of
*NL*
a
moral
philosopher
too
;
for
which
reason
,
when
his
tobacco-pipe
snapp
'd
*NL*
short
in
the
middle
,
--
he
had
nothing
to
do
,
as
such
,
but
to
have
taken
*NL*
hold
of
the
two
pieces
,
and
thrown
them
gently
upon
the
back
of
the
*NL*
fire
.
--
He
did
no
such
thing
;
--
he
threw
them
with
all
the
violence
in
the
*NL*
world
;
--
and
,
to
give
the
action
still
more
emphasis
,
--
he
started
upon
*NL*
both
his
legs
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
looked
something
like
heat
;
--
and
the
manner
of
his
reply
to
what
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
was
saying
,
proved
it
was
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
`
Not
choose
,
'
quoth
my
father
,
-LRB-
repeating
my
uncle
Toby
's
words
-RRB-
`
to
*NL*
let
a
man
come
so
near
her
!
'
--
By
Heaven
,
brother
Toby
!
you
would
try
the
*NL*
patience
of
Job
;
--
and
I
think
I
have
the
plagues
of
one
already
without
*NL*
it
.
--
Why
?
--
Where
?
--
Wherein
?
--
Wherefore
?
--
Upon
what
account
?
replied
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
:
in
the
utmost
astonishment
.
--
To
think
,
said
my
father
,
of
a
*NL*
man
living
to
your
age
,
brother
,
and
knowing
so
little
about
women
!
--
I
*NL*
know
nothing
at
all
about
them
,
--
replied
my
uncle
Toby
:
And
I
think
,
*NL*
continued
he
,
that
the
shock
I
received
the
year
after
the
demolition
of
*NL*
Dunkirk
,
in
my
affair
with
widow
Wadman
;
--
which
shock
you
know
I
should
*NL*
not
have
received
,
but
from
my
total
ignorance
of
the
sex
,
--
has
given
me
*NL*
just
cause
to
say
,
That
I
neither
know
nor
do
pretend
to
know
any
thing
*NL*
about
'em
or
their
concerns
either
.
--
Methinks
,
brother
,
replied
my
*NL*
father
,
you
might
,
at
least
,
know
so
much
as
the
right
end
of
a
woman
*NL*
from
the
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
said
in
Aristotle
's
Master
Piece
,
`
That
when
a
man
doth
think
of
*NL*
any
thing
which
is
past
,
--
he
looketh
down
upon
the
ground
;
--
but
that
*NL*
when
he
thinketh
of
something
that
is
to
come
,
he
looketh
up
towards
the
*NL*
heavens
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
,
I
suppose
,
thought
of
neither
,
for
he
look
'd
*NL*
horizontally
.
--
Right
end
!
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
muttering
the
two
words
*NL*
low
to
himself
,
and
fixing
his
two
eyes
insensibly
as
he
muttered
them
,
*NL*
upon
a
small
crevice
,
formed
by
a
bad
joint
in
the
chimney-piece
--
Right
*NL*
end
of
a
woman
!
--
I
declare
,
quoth
my
uncle
,
I
know
no
more
which
it
is
*NL*
than
the
man
in
the
moon
;
--
and
if
I
was
to
think
,
continued
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
-LRB-
keeping
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
the
bad
joint
-RRB-
this
month
*NL*
together
,
I
am
sure
I
should
not
be
able
to
find
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
brother
Toby
,
replied
my
father
,
I
will
tell
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
thing
in
this
world
,
continued
my
father
-LRB-
filling
a
fresh
*NL*
pipe
-RRB-

every
thing
in
this
world
,
my
dear
brother
Toby
,
has
two
*NL*
handles
.

Not
always
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
At
least
,
replied
my
father
,
*NL*
every
one
has
two
hands
,
--
which
comes
to
the
same
thing
.
--
Now
,
if
a
man
*NL*
was
to
sit
down
coolly
,
and
consider
within
himself
the
make
,
the
shape
,
*NL*
the
construction
,
come-at-ability
,
and
convenience
of
all
the
parts
*NL*
which
constitute
the
whole
of
that
animal
,
called
Woman
,
and
compare
*NL*
them
analogically
--
I
never
understood
rightly
the
meaning
of
that
*NL*
word
,
--
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Analogy
,
replied
my
father
,
is
the
certain
relation
and
agreement
*NL*
which
different
--
Here
a
devil
of
a
rap
at
the
door
snapped
my
father
's
*NL*
definition
-LRB-
like
his
tobacco-pipe
-RRB-
in
two
,
--
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
crushed
the
head
of
as
notable
and
curious
a
dissertation
as
ever
was
*NL*
engendered
in
the
womb
of
speculation
;
--
it
was
some
months
before
my
*NL*
father
could
get
an
opportunity
to
be
safely
delivered
of
it
:
--
And
,
at
*NL*
this
hour
,
it
is
a
thing
full
as
problematical
as
the
subject
of
the
*NL*
dissertation
itself
,
--
-LRB-
considering
the
confusion
and
distresses
of
our
*NL*
domestick
misadventures
,
which
are
now
coming
thick
one
upon
the
back
*NL*
of

Obadiah

ordered
to
saddle
a
horse

go

for
Dr.
Slop

;

so
that
no

can
say

If

;
--
and
,
after
finding
it
to
be
no
more
than
*NL*
two
minutes
,
thirteen
seconds
,
and
three-fifths
,
--
should
take
upon
him
*NL*
to
insult
over
me
for
such
a
breach
in
the
unity
,
or
rather
probability
*NL*
of
time
;
--
I
would
remind
him
,
that
the
idea
of
duration
,
and
of
its
*NL*
simple
modes
,
is
got
merely
from
the
train
and
succession
of
our
*NL*
ideas
--
and
is
the
true
scholastic
pendulum
,
--
and
by
which
,
as
a
scholar
,
*NL*
I
will
be
tried
in
this
matter
,
--
abjuring
and
detesting
the
jurisdiction
*NL*
of
all
other
pendulums
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
therefore
desire
him
to
consider
that
it
is
but
poor
eight
miles
*NL*
from
Shandy-Hall
to
Dr.
Slop
,
the
man-midwife
's
house
:
--
and
that
whilst
*NL*
Obadiah
has
been
going
those
said
miles
and
back
,
I
have
brought
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
from
Namur
,
quite
across
all
Flanders
,
into
England
:
--
That
*NL*
I
have
had
him
ill
upon
my
hands
near
four
years
;
--
and
have
since
*NL*
travelled
him
and
Corporal
Trim
in
a
chariot-and-four
,
a
journey
of
near
*NL*
two
hundred
miles
down
into
Yorkshire
.
--
all
which
put
together
,
must
*NL*
have
prepared
the
reader
's
imagination
for
the
entrance
of
Dr.
Slop
upon
*NL*
the
stage
,
--
as
much
,
at
least
-LRB-
I
hope
-RRB-
as
a
dance
,
a
song
,
or
a
concerto
*NL*
between
the
acts
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
my
hypercritick
is
intractable
,
alledging
,
that
two
minutes
*NL*
and
thirteen
seconds
are
no
more
than
two
minutes
and
thirteen
*NL*
seconds
,
--
when
I
have
said
all
I
can
about
them
;
and
that
this
plea
,
*NL*
though
it
might
save
me
dramatically
,
will
damn
me
biographically
,
*NL*
rendering
my
book
from
this
very
moment
,
a
professed
Romance
,
which
,
*NL*
before
,
was
a
book
apocryphal
:
--
If
I
am
thus
pressed
--
I
then
put
an
*NL*
end
to
the
whole
objection
and
controversy
about
it
all
at
once
,
--
by
*NL*
acquainting
him
,
that
Obadiah
had
not
got
above
threescore
yards
from
*NL*
the
stable-yard
,
before
he
met
with
Dr.
Slop
;
--
and
indeed
he
gave
a
*NL*
dirty
proof
that
he
had
met
with
him
,
and
was
within
an
ace
of
giving
a
*NL*
tragical
one
too
.

to
yourself

Imagine
to
yourself
a
little
squat
,
uncourtly
figure
of
a
Doctor
Slop
,
*NL*
of
about
four
feet
and
a
half
perpendicular
height
,
with
a
breadth
of
*NL*
back
,
and
a
sesquipedality
of
belly
,
which
might
have
done
honour
to
a
*NL*
serjeant
in
the
horse-guards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
out-lines
of
Dr.
Slop
's
figure
,
which
--
if
you
have
*NL*
read
Hogarth
's
analysis
of
beauty
,
and
if
you
have
not
,
I
wish
you
*NL*
would
;
--
you
must
know
,
may
as
certainly
be
caricatured
,
and
conveyed
to
*NL*
the
mind
by
three
strokes
as
three
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Imagine
such
a
one
,
--
for
such
,
I
say
,
were
the
outlines
of
Dr.
Slop
's
*NL*
figure
,
coming
slowly
along
,
foot
by
foot
,
waddling
thro
'
the
dirt
upon
*NL*
the
vertebrae
of
a
little
diminutive
pony
,
of
a
pretty
colour
--
but
of
*NL*
strength
,
--
alack
!
--
scarce
able
to
have
made
an
amble
of
it
,
under
such
*NL*
a
fardel
,
had
the
roads
been
in
an
ambling
condition
.
--
They
were
*NL*
not
.
--
Imagine
to
yourself
,
Obadiah
mounted
upon
a
strong
monster
of
*NL*
a
coach-horse
,
pricked
into
a
full
gallop
,
and
making
all
practicable
*NL*
speed
the
adverse
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pray
,
Sir
,
let
me
interest
you
a
moment
in
this
description
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Dr.
Slop
beheld
Obadiah
a
mile
off
,
posting
in
a
narrow
lane
*NL*
directly
towards
him
,
at
that
monstrous
rate
,
--
splashing
and
plunging
*NL*
like
a
devil
thro
'
thick
and
thin
,
as
he
approached
,
would
not
such
a
*NL*
phaenomenon
,
with
such
a
vortex
of
mud
and
water
moving
along
with
it
,
*NL*
round
its
axis
,
--
have
been
a
subject
of
juster
apprehension
to
Dr.
Slop
*NL*
in
his
situation
,
than
the
worst
of
Whiston
's
comets
?
--
To
say
nothing
of
*NL*
the
Nucleus
;
that
is
,
of
Obadiah
and
the
coach-horse
.
--
In
my
idea
,
the
*NL*
vortex
alone
of
'em
was
enough
to
have
involved
and
carried
,
if
not
the
*NL*
doctor
,
at
least
the
doctor
's
pony
,
quite
away
with
it
.
What
then
do
you
*NL*
think
must
the
terror
and
hydrophobia
of
Dr.
Slop
have
been
,
when
you
*NL*
read
-LRB-
which
you
are
just
going
to
do
-RRB-
that
he
was
advancing
thus
warily
*NL*
along
towards
Shandy-Hall
,
and
had
approached
to
within
sixty
yards
of
*NL*
it
,
and
within
five
yards
of
a
sudden
turn
,
made
by
an
acute
angle
*NL*
of
the
garden-wall
,
--
and
in
the
dirtiest
part
of
a
dirty
*NL*
lane
,
--
when
Obadiah
and
his
coach-horse
turned
the
corner
,
rapid
,
*NL*
furious
,
--
pop
,
--
full
upon
him
!
--
Nothing
,
I
think
,
in
nature
,
can
be
*NL*
supposed
more
terrible
than
such
a
rencounter
,
--
so
imprompt
!
so
ill
*NL*
prepared
to
stand
the
shock
of
it
as
Dr.
Slop
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
could
Dr.
Slop
do
?
--
he
crossed
himself
+
--
Pugh
!
--
but
the
doctor
,
*NL*
Sir
,
was
a
Papist
.
--
No
matter
;
he
had
better
have
kept
hold
of
the
*NL*
pummel
.
--
He
had
so
;
--
nay
,
as
it
happened
,
he
had
better
have
done
*NL*
nothing
at
all
;
for
in
crossing
himself
he
let
go
his
whip
,
--
and
in
*NL*
attempting
to
save
his
whip
betwixt
his
knee
and
his
saddle
's
skirt
,
as
*NL*
it
slipped
,
he
lost
his
stirrup
,
--
in
losing
which
he
lost
his
seat
;
--
and
*NL*
in
the
multitude
of
all
these
losses
-LRB-
which
,
by
the
bye
,
shews
what
*NL*
little
advantage
there
is
in
crossing
-RRB-
the
unfortunate
doctor
lost
his
*NL*
presence
of
mind
.
So
that
without
waiting
for
Obadiah
's
onset
,
he
left
*NL*
his
pony
to
its
destiny
,
tumbling
off
it
diagonally
,
something
in
the
*NL*
stile
and
manner
of
a
pack
of
wool
,
and
without
any
other
consequence
*NL*
from
the
fall
,
save
that
of
being
left
-LRB-
as
it
would
have
been
-RRB-
with
the
*NL*
broadest
part
of
him
sunk
about
twelve
inches
deep
in
the
mire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Obadiah
pull
'd
off
his
cap
twice
to
Dr.
Slop
;
--
once
as
he
was
*NL*
falling
,
--
and
then
again
when
he
saw
him
seated
.
--
Ill-timed
*NL*
complaisance
;
--
had
not
the
fellow
better
have
stopped
his
horse
,
and
*NL*
got
off
and
help
'd
him
?
--
Sir
,
he
did
all
that
his
situation
would
*NL*
allow
;
--
but
the
Momentum
of
the
coach-horse
was
so
great
,
that
Obadiah
*NL*
could
not
do
it
all
at
once
;
he
rode
in
a
circle
three
times
round
Dr.
*NL*
Slop
,
before
he
could
fully
accomplish
it
any
how
;
--
and
at
the
last
,
*NL*
when
he
did
stop
his
beast
,
't
was
done
with
such
an
explosion
of
mud
,
*NL*
that
Obadiah
had
better
have
been
a
league
off
.
In
short
,
never
was
a
*NL*
Dr.
Slop
so
beluted
,
and
so
transubstantiated
,
since
that
affair
came
*NL*
into
fashion
.

When
Dr.
Slop
entered
the
back
parlour
,
where
my
father
and
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
were
discoursing
upon
the
nature
of
women
,
--
it
was
hard
to
*NL*
determine
whether
Dr.
Slop
's
figure
,
or
Dr.
Slop
's
presence
,
occasioned
*NL*
more
surprize
to
them
;
for
as
the
accident
happened
so
near
the
house
,
*NL*
as
not
to
make
it
worth
while
for
Obadiah
to
remount
him
,
--
Obadiah
had
*NL*
led
him
in
as
he
was
,
unwiped
,
unappointed
,
unannealed
,
with
all
his
*NL*
stains
and
blotches
on
him
.
--
He
stood
like
Hamlet
's
ghost
,
motionless
*NL*
and
speechless
,
for
a
full
minute
and
a
half
at
the
parlour-door
*NL*
-LRB-
Obadiah
still
holding
his
hand
-RRB-
with
all
the
majesty
of
mud
.
His
hinder
*NL*
parts
,
upon
which
he
had
received
his
fall
,
totally
besmeared
,
--
and
in
*NL*
every
other
part
of
him
,
blotched
over
in
such
a
manner
with
Obadiah
's
*NL*
explosion
,
that
you
would
have
sworn
-LRB-
without
mental
reservation
-RRB-
that
*NL*
every
grain
of
it
had
taken
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
fair
opportunity
for
my
uncle
Toby
to
have
triumphed
over
*NL*
my
father
in
his
turn
;
--
for
no
mortal
,
who
had
beheld
Dr.
Slop
in
that
*NL*
pickle
,
could
have
dissented
from
so
much
,
at
least
,
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
opinion
,
`
That
mayhap
his
sister
might
not
care
to
let
such
a
Dr.
Slop
*NL*
come
so
near
her
...
'
But
it
was
the
Argumentum
ad
hominem
;
and
if
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
was
not
very
expert
at
it
,
you
may
think
,
he
might
not
care
*NL*
to
use
it
.
--
No
;
the
reason
was
,
--
't
was
not
his
nature
to
insult
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Slop
's
presence
at
that
time
,
was
no
less
problematical
than
the
*NL*
mode
of
it
;
tho
'
it
is
certain
,
one
moment
's
reflexion
in
my
father
*NL*
might
have
solved
it
;
for
he
had
apprized
Dr.
Slop
but
the
week
before
,
*NL*
that
my
mother
was
at
her
full
reckoning
;
and
as
the
doctor
had
heard
*NL*
nothing
since
,
't
was
natural
and
very
political
too
in
him
,
to
have
*NL*
taken
a
ride
to
Shandy-Hall
,
as
he
did
,
merely
to
see
how
matters
went
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
father
's
mind
took
unfortunately
a
wrong
turn
in
the
*NL*
investigation
;
running
,
like
the
hypercritick
's
,
altogether
upon
*NL*
the
ringing
of
the
bell
and
the
rap
upon
the
door
,
--
measuring
their
*NL*
distance
,
and
keeping
his
mind
so
intent
upon
the
operation
,
as
to
have
*NL*
power
to
think
of
nothing
else
,
--
common-place
infirmity
of
the
greatest
*NL*
mathematicians
!
working
with
might
and
main
at
the
demonstration
,
and
so
*NL*
wasting
all
their
strength
upon
it
,
that
they
have
none
left
in
them
to
*NL*
draw
the
corollary
,
to
do
good
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ringing
of
the
bell
,
and
the
rap
upon
the
door
,
struck
likewise
*NL*
strong
upon
the
sensorium
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
but
it
excited
a
very
*NL*
different
train
of
thoughts
;
--
the
two
irreconcileable
pulsations
*NL*
instantly
brought
Stevinus
,
the
great
engineer
,
along
with
them
,
into
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
.
What
business
Stevinus
had
in
this
affair
,
--
is
*NL*
the
greatest
problem
of
all
:
--
It
shall
be
solved
,
--
but
not
in
the
next

chapter

Writing

properly
managed

as
you
may
be
sure
I
think
mine
is
-RRB-
is
*NL*
but
a
different
name
for
conversation
.
As
no
one
,
who
knows
what
he
is
*NL*
about
in
good
company
,
would
venture
to
talk
all
;

so
no
author
,
who
*NL*
understands
the
just
boundaries
of
decorum
and
good-breeding
,
would
*NL*
presume
to
think
all
:
The
truest
respect
which
you
can
pay
to
the
*NL*
reader
's
understanding
,
is
to
halve
this
matter
amicably
,
and
leave
him
*NL*
something
to
imagine
,
in
his
turn
,
as
well
as
yourself
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
I
am
eternally
paying
him
compliments
of
this
kind
,
and
*NL*
do
all
that
lies
in
my
power
to
keep
his
imagination
as
busy
as
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
his
turn
now
;
--
I
have
given
an
ample
description
of
Dr.
Slop
's
*NL*
sad
overthrow
,
and
of
his
sad
appearance
in
the
back-parlour
;
--
his
*NL*
imagination
must
now
go
on
with
it
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
the
reader
imagine
then
,
that
Dr.
Slop
has
told
his
tale
--
and
in
*NL*
what
words
,
and
with
what
aggravations
,
his
fancy
chooses
;
--
Let
him
*NL*
suppose
,
that
Obadiah
has
told
his
tale
also
,
and
with
such
rueful
looks
*NL*
of
affected
concern
,
as
he
thinks
best
will
contrast
the
two
figures
as
*NL*
they
stand
by
each
other
.
--
Let
him
imagine
,
that
my
father
has
*NL*
stepped
up
stairs
to
see
my
mother
.
--
And
,
to
conclude
this
work
of
*NL*
imagination
,
--
let
him
imagine
the
doctor
washed
,
--
rubbed
down
,
and
*NL*
condoled
,
--
felicitated
,
--
got
into
a
pair
of
Obadiah
's
pumps
,
stepping
*NL*
forwards
towards
the
door
,
upon
the
very
point
of
entering
upon
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
Truce
!
--
truce
,
good
Dr.
Slop
!
--
stay
thy
obstetrick
hand
;
--
return
it
*NL*
safe
into
thy
bosom
to
keep
it
warm
;
--
little
dost
thou
know
what
*NL*
obstacles
,
--
little
dost
thou
think
what
hidden
causes
,
retard
its
*NL*
operation
!
--
Hast
thou
,
Dr.
Slop
,
--
hast
thou
been
entrusted
with
the
*NL*
secret
articles
of
the
solemn
treaty
which
has
brought
thee
into
this
*NL*
place
?

Art
thou
aware
that
at
this
instant
,
a
daughter
of
Lucina
is
put
*NL*
obstetrically
over
thy
head
?
Alas

't
is
too
true

Besides

what
canst
thou
do
?

Thou
hast
come
forth
unarm

thou
*NL*
hast
left
thy

thy

thy

*NL*
*NL*
Your
sudden
and
unexpected
arrival
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
addressing
*NL*
himself
to
Dr.
Slop
,
-LRB-
all
three
of
them
sitting
down
to
the
fire
*NL*
together
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
began
to
speak
-RRB-
--
instantly
brought
the
great
*NL*
Stevinus
into
my
head
,
who
,
you
must
know
,
is
a
favourite
author
with
*NL*
me
.
--
Then
,
added
my
father
,
making
use
of
the
argument
Ad
Crumenam
,
--
I
*NL*
will
lay
twenty
guineas
to
a
single
crown-piece
-LRB-
which
will
serve
to
*NL*
give
away
to
Obadiah
when
he
gets
back
-RRB-
that
this
same
Stevinus
was
some
*NL*
engineer
or
other
--
or
has
wrote
something
or
other
,
either
directly
or
*NL*
indirectly
,
upon
the
science
of
fortification
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
has
so
,
--
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
I
knew
it
,
said
my
father
,
though
,
*NL*
for
the
soul
of
me
,
I
can
not
see
what
kind
of
connection
there
can
*NL*
be
betwixt
Dr.
Slop
's
sudden
coming
,
and
a
discourse
upon
*NL*
fortification
;
--
yet
I
fear
'd
it
.
--
Talk
of
what
we
will
,
brother
,
--
or
let
*NL*
the
occasion
be
never
so
foreign
or
unfit
for
the
subject
,
--
you
are
*NL*
sure
to
bring
it
in
.
I
would
not
,
brother
Toby
,
continued
my
*NL*
father
,
--
I
declare
I
would
not
have
my
head
so
full
of
curtins
and
*NL*
horn-works
.
--
That
I
dare
say
you
would
not
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
interrupting
*NL*
him
,
and
laughing
most
immoderately
at
his
pun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dennis
the
critic
could
not
detest
and
abhor
a
pun
,
or
the
insinuation
*NL*
of
a
pun
,
more
cordially
than
my
father
;
--
he
would
grow
testy
upon
it
at
*NL*
any
time
;
--
but
to
be
broke
in
upon
by
one
,
in
a
serious
discourse
,
was
*NL*
as
bad
,
he
would
say
,
as
a
fillip
upon
the
nose
;
--
he
saw
no
difference
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
addressing
himself
to
Dr.
Slop
,
--
the
*NL*
curtins
my
brother
Shandy
mentions
here
,
have
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
beadsteads
;
--
tho
'
,
I
know
Du
Cange
says
,
`
That
bed-curtains
,
in
all
*NL*
probability
,
have
taken
their
name
from
them
;
'
--
nor
have
the
horn-works
*NL*
he
speaks
of
,
any
thing
in
the
world
to
do
with
the
horn-works
of
*NL*
cuckoldom
:
But
the
Curtin
,
Sir
,
is
the
word
we
use
in
fortification
,
for
*NL*
that
part
of
the
wall
or
rampart
which
lies
between
the
two
bastions
and
*NL*
joins
them
--
Besiegers
seldom
offer
to
carry
on
their
attacks
directly
*NL*
against
the
curtin
,
for
this
reason
,
because
they
are
so
well
flanked
.
*NL*
-LRB-
'T
is
the
case
of
other
curtains
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
laughing
.
-RRB-
However
,
*NL*
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
make
them
sure
,
we
generally
choose
to
place
*NL*
ravelins
before
them
,
taking
care
only
to
extend
them
beyond
the
fosse
*NL*
or
ditch
:
--
The
common
men
,
who
know
very
little
of
fortification
,
*NL*
confound
the
ravelin
and
the
half-moon
together
,
--
tho
'
they
are
very
*NL*
different
things
;
--
not
in
their
figure
or
construction
,
for
we
make
*NL*
them
exactly
alike
,
in
all
points
;
for
they
always
consist
of
two
faces
,
*NL*
making
a
salient
angle
,
with
the
gorges
,
not
straight
,
but
in
form
of
*NL*
a
crescent
;
--
Where
then
lies
the
difference
?
-LRB-
quoth
my
father
,
a
little
*NL*
testily
.
-RRB-
--
In
their
situations
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
:
--
For
when
a
*NL*
ravelin
,
brother
,
stands
before
the
curtin
,
it
is
a
ravelin
;
and
when
a
*NL*
ravelin
stands
before
a
bastion
,
then
the
ravelin
is
not
a
ravelin
;
--
it
*NL*
is
a
half-moon
;
--
a
half-moon
likewise
is
a
half-moon
,
and
no
more
,
so
*NL*
long
as
it
stands
before
its
bastion
;
--
but
was
it
to
change
place
,
and
*NL*
get
before
the
curtin
,
--
`
twould
be
no
longer
a
half-moon
;
a
half-moon
,
*NL*
in
that
case
,
is
not
a
half-moon
;
--
't
is
no
more
than
a
ravelin
.
--
I
*NL*
think
,
quoth
my
father
,
that
the
noble
science
of
defence
has
its
weak
*NL*
sides
--
as
well
as
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
horn-work
-LRB-
high
!
ho
!
sigh
'd
my
father
-RRB-
which
,
continued
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
my
brother
was
speaking
of
,
they
are
a
very
considerable
*NL*
part
of
an
outwork
;
--
they
are
called
by
the
French
engineers
,
Ouvrage
a
*NL*
corne
,
and
we
generally
make
them
to
cover
such
places
as
we
suspect
*NL*
to
be
weaker
than
the
rest
;
--
't
is
formed
by
two
epaulments
or
*NL*
demi-bastions
--
they
are
very
pretty
,
--
and
if
you
will
take
a
walk
,
I
'll
*NL*
engage
to
shew
you
one
well
worth
your
trouble
.
--
I
own
,
continued
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
when
we
crown
them
,
--
they
are
much
stronger
,
but
then
they
*NL*
are
very
expensive
,
and
take
up
a
great
deal
of
ground
,
so
that
,
in
my
*NL*
opinion
,
they
are
most
of
use
to
cover
or
defend
the
head
of
a
camp
;
*NL*
otherwise
the
double
tenaille
--
By
the
mother
who
bore
us
!
--
brother
Toby
,
*NL*
quoth
my
father
,
not
able
to
hold
out
any
longer
,
--
you
would
provoke
a
*NL*
saint
;
--
here
have
you
got
us
,
I
know
not
how
,
not
only
souse
into
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
old
subject
again
:
--
But
so
full
is
your
head
of
these
*NL*
confounded
works
,
that
though
my
wife
is
this
moment
in
the
pains
of
*NL*
labour
,
and
you
hear
her
cry
out
,
yet
nothing
will
serve
you
but
to
*NL*
carry
off
the
man-midwife
.
--
Accoucheur
,
--
if
you
please
,
quoth
Dr.
*NL*
Slop
.
--
With
all
my
heart
,
replied
my
father
,
I
do
n't
care
what
they
*NL*
call
you
,
--
but
I
wish
the
whole
science
of
fortification
,
with
all
its
*NL*
inventors
,
at
the
devil
;
--
it
has
been
the
death
of
thousands
,
--
and
it
*NL*
will
be
mine
in
the
end
.
--
I
would
not
,
I
would
not
,
brother
Toby
,
*NL*
have
my
brains
so
full
of
saps
,
mines
,
blinds
,
gabions
,
pallisadoes
,
*NL*
ravelins
,
half-moons
,
and
such
trumpery
,
to
be
proprietor
of
Namur
,
and
*NL*
of
all
the
towns
in
Flanders
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
was
a
man
patient
of
injuries
;
--
not
from
want
of
*NL*
courage
,
--
I
have
told
you
in
a
former
chapter
,
`
that
he
was
a
man
of
*NL*
courage
:
'
--
And
will
add
here
,
that
where
just
occasions
presented
,
or
*NL*
called
it
forth
,
--
I
know
no
man
under
whose
arm
I
would
have
sooner
*NL*
taken
shelter
;
--
nor
did
this
arise
from
any
insensibility
or
obtuseness
*NL*
of
his
intellectual
parts
;
--
for
he
felt
this
insult
of
my
father
's
*NL*
as
feelingly
as
a
man
could
do
;
--
but
he
was
of
a
peaceful
,
placid
*NL*
nature
,
--
no
jarring
element
in
it
,
--
all
was
mixed
up
so
kindly
within
*NL*
him
;
my
uncle
Toby
had
scarce
a
heart
to
retaliate
upon
a
fly
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Go
--
says
he
,
one
day
at
dinner
,
to
an
over-grown
one
which
had
buzzed
*NL*
about
his
nose
,
and
tormented
him
cruelly
all
dinner-time
,
--
and
which
*NL*
after
infinite
attempts
,
he
had
caught
at
last
,
as
it
flew
by
him
;
--
I
'll
*NL*
not
hurt
thee
,
says
my
uncle
Toby
,
rising
from
his
chair
,
and
going
*NL*
across
the
room
,
with
the
fly
in
his
hand
,
--
I
'll
not
hurt
a
hair
of
*NL*
thy
head
:
--
Go
,
says
he
,
lifting
up
the
sash
,
and
opening
his
hand
as
he
*NL*
spoke
,
to
let
it
escape
;
--
go
,
poor
devil
,
get
thee
gone
,
why
should
I
*NL*
hurt
thee
?
--
This
world
surely
is
wide
enough
to
hold
both
thee
and
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
but
ten
years
old
when
this
happened
:
but
whether
it
was
,
that
the
*NL*
action
itself
was
more
in
unison
to
my
nerves
at
that
age
of
pity
,
which
*NL*
instantly
set
my
whole
frame
into
one
vibration
of
most
pleasurable
*NL*
sensation
;
--
or
how
far
the
manner
and
expression
of
it
might
go
towards
*NL*
it
;
--
or
in
what
degree
,
or
by
what
secret
magick
,
--
a
tone
of
voice
and
*NL*
harmony
of
movement
,
attuned
by
mercy
,
might
find
a
passage
to
my
heart
,
*NL*
I
know
not
;
--
this
I
know
,
that
the
lesson
of
universal
good-will
then
*NL*
taught
and
imprinted
by
my
uncle
Toby
,
has
never
since
been
worn
out
of
*NL*
my
mind
:
And
tho
'
I
would
not
depreciate
what
the
study
of
the
Literae
*NL*
humaniores
,
at
the
university
,
have
done
for
me
in
that
respect
,
or
*NL*
discredit
the
other
helps
of
an
expensive
education
bestowed
upon
me
,
*NL*
both
at
home
and
abroad
since
;
--
yet
I
often
think
that
I
owe
one
half
of
*NL*
my
philanthropy
to
that
one
accidental
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
to
serve
for
parents
and
governors
instead
of
a
whole
volume
*NL*
upon
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
give
the
reader
this
stroke
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
picture
,
by
*NL*
the
instrument
with
which
I
drew
the
other
parts
of
it
,
--
that
taking
in
*NL*
no
more
than
the
mere
Hobby-Horsical
likeness
:
--
this
is
a
part
of
his
*NL*
moral
character
.
My
father
,
in
this
patient
endurance
of
wrongs
,
which
I
*NL*
mention
,
was
very
different
,
as
the
reader
must
long
ago
have
noted
;
he
*NL*
had
a
much
more
acute
and
quick
sensibility
of
nature
,
attended
with
a
*NL*
little
soreness
of
temper
;
tho
'
this
never
transported
him
to
any
thing
*NL*
which
looked
like
malignancy
:
--
yet
in
the
little
rubs
and
vexations
*NL*
of
life
,
't
was
apt
to
shew
itself
in
a
drollish
and
witty
kind
of
*NL*
peevishness
:
--
He
was
,
however
,
frank
and
generous
in
his
nature
;
--
at
all
*NL*
times
open
to
conviction
;
and
in
the
little
ebullitions
of
this
subacid
*NL*
humour
towards
others
,
but
particularly
towards
my
uncle
Toby
,
whom
he
*NL*
truly
loved
:
--
he
would
feel
more
pain
,
ten
times
told
-LRB-
except
in
the
*NL*
affair
of
my
aunt
Dinah
,
or
where
an
hypothesis
was
concerned
-RRB-
than
what
*NL*
he
ever
gave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
characters
of
the
two
brothers
,
in
this
view
of
them
,
reflected
*NL*
light
upon
each
other
,
and
appeared
with
great
advantage
in
this
affair
*NL*
which
arose
about
Stevinus
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
need
not
tell
the
reader
,
if
he
keeps
a
Hobby-Horse
,
--
that
a
man
's
*NL*
Hobby-Horse
is
as
tender
a
part
as
he
has
about
him
;
and
that
*NL*
these
unprovoked
strokes
at
my
uncle
Toby
's
could
not
be
unfelt
by
*NL*
him
.
--
No
:
--
as
I
said
above
,
my
uncle
Toby
did
feel
them
,
and
very
*NL*
sensibly
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pray
,
Sir
,
what
said
he
?
--
How
did
he
behave
?
--
O
,
Sir
!
--
it
was
great
:
For
*NL*
as
soon
as
my
father
had
done
insulting
his
Hobby-Horse
,
--
he
turned
his
*NL*
head
without
the
least
emotion
,
from
Dr.
Slop
,
to
whom
he
was
addressing
*NL*
his
discourse
,
and
looking
up
into
my
father
's
face
,
with
a
countenance
*NL*
spread
over
with
so
much
good-nature
;
--
so
placid
;
--
so
fraternal
;
--
so
*NL*
inexpressibly
tender
towards
him
:
--
it
penetrated
my
father
to
his
heart
:
*NL*
He
rose
up
hastily
from
his
chair
,
and
seizing
hold
of
both
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
hands
as
he
spoke
:
--
Brother
Toby
,
said
he
:
--
I
beg
thy
*NL*
pardon
;
--
forgive
,
I
pray
thee
,
this
rash
humour
which
my
mother
gave
*NL*
me
.
--
My
dear
,
dear
brother
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
,
rising
up
by
my
*NL*
father
's
help
,
say
no
more
about
it
;
--
you
are
heartily
welcome
,
had
it
*NL*
been
ten
times
as
much
,
brother
.
But
't
is
ungenerous
,
replied
my
father
,
*NL*
to
hurt
any
man
;
--
a
brother
worse
;
--
but
to
hurt
a
brother
of
such
gentle
*NL*
manners
,
--
so
unprovoking
,
--
and
so
unresenting
;
--
't
is
base
:
--
By
Heaven
,
*NL*
't
is
cowardly
.
--
You
are
heartily
welcome
,
brother
,
quoth
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
,
--
had
it
been
fifty
times
as
much
.
--
Besides
,

*NL*
my

Toby

cried
my

either
with
your
amusements
or
your

pleasures
,
unless
it
was
in

it

to
increase

Brother
Shandy
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
wistfully
in
his
*NL*
face
,
--
you
are
much
mistaken
in
this
point
:
--
for
you
do
increase
my
*NL*
pleasure
very
much
,
in
begetting
children
for
the
Shandy
family
at
your
*NL*
time
of
life

But

Not

*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
,
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
were
left
*NL*
both
standing
,
like
Brutus
and
Cassius
,
at
the
close
of
the
scene
,
*NL*
making
up
their
accounts
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
my
father
spoke
the
three
last
words
,
--
he
sat
down
;
--
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
exactly
followed
his
example
,
only
,
that
before
he
took
his
chair
,
he
*NL*
rung
the
bell
,
to
order
Corporal
Trim
,
who
was
in
waiting
,
to
step
*NL*
home
for
Stevinus
:
--
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
being
no
farther
off
than
the
*NL*
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
men
would
have
dropped
the
subject
of
Stevinus
;
--
but
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
had
no
resentment
in
his
heart
,
and
he
went
on
with
the
subject
,
to
shew
*NL*
my
father
that
he
had
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
sudden
appearance
,
Dr.
Slop
,
quoth
my
uncle
,
resuming
the
*NL*
discourse
,
instantly
brought
Stevinus
into
my
head
.
-LRB-
My
father
,
you
*NL*
may
be
sure
,
did
not
offer
to
lay
any
more
wagers
upon
Stevinus
's
*NL*
head
.
-RRB-
--
Because
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
the
celebrated
sailing
*NL*
chariot
,
which
belonged
to
Prince
Maurice
,
and
was
of
such
wonderful
*NL*
contrivance
and
velocity
,
as
to
carry
half
a
dozen
people
thirty
German
*NL*
miles
,
in
I
do
n't
know
how
few
minutes
,
--
was
invented
by
Stevinus
,
that
*NL*
great
mathematician
and
engineer
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
might
have
spared
your
servant
the
trouble
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
-LRB-
as
the
*NL*
fellow
is
lame
-RRB-
of
going
for
Stevinus
's
account
of
it
,
because
in
my
*NL*
return
from
Leyden
thro
'
the
Hague
,
I
walked
as
far
as
Schevling
,
which
*NL*
is
two
long
miles
,
on
purpose
to
take
a
view
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
's
nothing
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
what
the
learned
Peireskius
*NL*
did
,
who
walked
a
matter
of
five
hundred
miles
,
reckoning
from
Paris
to
*NL*
Schevling
,
and
from
Schevling
to
Paris
back
again
,
in
order
to
see
it
,
*NL*
and
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
men
can
not
bear
to
be
out-gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
fool
Peireskius
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
.
But
mark
,
't
was
out
of
no
*NL*
contempt
of
Peireskius
at
all
;
--
but
that
Peireskius
's
indefatigable
*NL*
labour
in
trudging
so
far
on
foot
,
out
of
love
for
the
sciences
,
reduced
*NL*
the
exploit
of
Dr.
Slop
,
in
that
affair
,
to
nothing
:
--
the
more
fool
*NL*
Peireskius
,
said
he
again
.
--
Why
so
?
--
replied
my
father
,
taking
his
*NL*
brother
's
part
,
not
only
to
make
reparation
as
fast
as
he
could
for
the
*NL*
insult
he
had
given
him
,
which
sat
still
upon
my
father
's
mind
;
--
but
*NL*
partly
,
that
my
father
began
really
to
interest
himself
in
the
*NL*
discourse
.
--
Why
so
?
--
said
he
.
Why
is
Peireskius
,
or
any
man
else
,
to
be
*NL*
abused
for
an
appetite
for
that
,
or
any
other
morsel
of
sound
knowledge
:
*NL*
For
notwithstanding
I
know
nothing
of
the
chariot
in
question
,
continued
*NL*
he
,
the
inventor
of
it
must
have
had
a
very
mechanical
head
;
and
tho
'
*NL*
I
can
not
guess
upon
what
principles
of
philosophy
he
has
atchieved
*NL*
it
;
--
yet
certainly
his
machine
has
been
constructed
upon
solid
ones
,
*NL*
be
they
what
they
will
,
or
it
could
not
have
answered
at
the
rate
my
*NL*
brother
mentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
answered
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
well
,
if
not
better
;
for
,
as
*NL*
Peireskius
elegantly
expresses
it
,
speaking
of
the
velocity
of
its
*NL*
motion
,
Tam
citus
erat
,
quam
erat
ventus
;
which
,
unless
I
have
forgot
my
*NL*
Latin
,
is
,
that
it
was
as
swift
as
the
wind
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
pray
,
Dr.
Slop
,
quoth
my
father
,
interrupting
my
uncle
-LRB-
tho
'
not
*NL*
without
begging
pardon
for
it
at
the
same
time
-RRB-
upon
what
principles
was
*NL*
this
self-same
chariot
set
a-going
?
--
Upon
very
pretty
principles
to
*NL*
be
sure
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
:
--
And
I
have
often
wondered
,
continued
he
,
*NL*
evading
the
question
,
why
none
of
our
gentry
,
who
live
upon
large
*NL*
plains
like
this
of
ours
,
--
-LRB-
especially
they
whose
wives
are
not
past
*NL*
child-bearing
-RRB-
attempt
nothing
of
this
kind
;
for
it
would
not
only
*NL*
be
infinitely
expeditious
upon
sudden
calls
,
to
which
the
sex
is
*NL*
subject
,
--
if
the
wind
only
served
,
--
but
would
be
excellent
good
*NL*
husbandry
to
make
use
of
the
winds
,
which
cost
nothing
,
and
which
eat
*NL*
nothing
,
rather
than
horses
,
which
-LRB-
the
devil
take
'em
-RRB-
both
cost
and
*NL*
eat
a
great
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
that
very
reason
,
replied
my
father
,
`
Because
they
cost
nothing
,
and
*NL*
because
they
eat
nothing
,
'
--
the
scheme
is
bad
;
--
it
is
the
consumption
of
*NL*
our
products
,
as
well
as
the
manufactures
of
them
,
which
gives
bread
to
*NL*
the
hungry
,
circulates
trade
,
--
brings
in
money
,
and
supports
the
value
*NL*
of
our
lands
;
--
and
tho
'
,
I
own
,
if
I
was
a
Prince
,
I
would
*NL*
generously
recompense
the
scientifick
head
which
brought
forth
such
*NL*
contrivances
;
--
yet
I
would
as
peremptorily
suppress
the
use
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
here
had
got
into
his
element
,
--
and
was
going
on
as
*NL*
prosperously
with
his
dissertation
upon
trade
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
had
*NL*
before
,
upon
his
of
fortification
;
--
but
to
the
loss
of
much
sound
*NL*
knowledge
,
the
destinies
in
the
morning
had
decreed
that
no
dissertation
*NL*
of
any
kind
should
be
spun
by
my
father
that
day
,

for
as
he
opened
his

mouth
to
begin

sentence

In
popped
Corporal
Trim
with
Stevinus
:
--
But
't
was
too
late
,
--
all
the
*NL*
discourse
had
been
exhausted
without
him
,
and
was
running
into
a
new
*NL*
channel
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
may
take
the
book
home
again
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
nodding
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
prithee
,
Corporal
,
quoth
my
father
,
drolling
,
--
look
first
into
it
,
*NL*
and
see
if
thou
canst
spy
aught
of
a
sailing
chariot
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corporal
Trim
,
by
being
in
the
service
,
had
learned
to
obey
,
--
and
not
to
*NL*
remonstrate
,
--
so
taking
the
book
to
a
side-table
,
and
running
over
*NL*
the
leaves
;
An
'
please
your
Honour
,
said
Trim
,
I
can
see
no
such
*NL*
thing
;
--
however
,
continued
the
Corporal
,
drolling
a
little
in
his
turn
,
*NL*
I
'll
make
sure
work
of
it
,
an
'
please
your
Honour
;
--
so
taking
hold
of
*NL*
the
two
covers
of
the
book
,
one
in
each
hand
,
and
letting
the
leaves
*NL*
fall
down
as
he
bent
the
covers
back
,
he
gave
the
book
a
good
sound
*NL*
shake
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
falling
out
,
however
,
said
Trim
,
an
'
please
your
*NL*
Honour
;
--
but
it
is
not
a
chariot
,
or
any
thing
like
one
:
--
Prithee
,
*NL*
Corporal
,
said
my
father
,
smiling
,
what
is
it
then
?
--
I
think
,
answered
*NL*
Trim
,
stooping
to
take
it
up
,
--
't
is
more
like
a
sermon
,
--
for
it
begins
*NL*
with
a
text
of
scripture
,
and
the
chapter
and
verse
;
--
and
then
goes
on
,
*NL*
not
as
a
chariot
,
but
like
a
sermon
directly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
conceive
how
it
is
possible
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
such
a
*NL*
thing
as
a
sermon
to
have
got
into
my
Stevinus
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
't
is
a
sermon
,
replied
Trim
:
--
but
if
it
please
your
Honours
,
*NL*
as
it
is
a
fair
hand
,
I
will
read
you
a
page
;
--
for
Trim
,
you
must
know
,
*NL*
loved
to
hear
himself
read
almost
as
well
as
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
ever
a
strong
propensity
,
said
my
father
,
to
look
into
things
*NL*
which
cross
my
way
,
by
such
strange
fatalities
as
these
;
--
and
as
we
*NL*
have
nothing
better
to
do
,
at
least
till
Obadiah
gets
back
,
I
shall
be
*NL*
obliged
to
you
,
brother
,
if
Dr.
Slop
has
no
objection
to
it
,
to
order
*NL*
the
Corporal
to
give
us
a
page
or
two
of
it
,

if
he
is
as
able
to
do
it
,
*NL*
as
he
seems
willing
.
An

Trim

I
officiated
*NL*
two
whole
campaigns
,
in
Flanders
,
as
clerk
to
the
chaplain
of
the

He

quoth
my

Toby
,
as
well
as
I
can
.

Trim

*NL*
I
assure
you

was
the
best
scholar
in
my
company
,
and
should
have
had
*NL*
the
next
halberd
,
but
for
the
poor
fellow
's
misfortune
.
Corporal
Trim
*NL*
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
made
an
humble
bow
to
his
master
;
then
*NL*
laying
down
his
hat
upon
the
floor
,
and
taking
up
the
sermon
in
his
*NL*
left
hand
,
in
order
to
have
his
right
at
liberty
,

he
advanced

nothing

doubting

into

If

said
my

addressing
himself
to
Dr.

Slop

Not
in

replied
Dr.
Slop
;

for
it

not
appear
on

which

of

it

so
that

*NL*
*NL*
--
But
before
the
Corporal
begins
,
I
must
first
give
you
a
description
*NL*
of
his
attitude
;
--
otherwise
he
will
naturally
stand
represented
,
by
your
*NL*
imagination
,
in
an
uneasy
posture
,
--
stiff
,
--
perpendicular
,
--
dividing
*NL*
the
weight
of
his
body
equally
upon
both
legs
;
--
his
eye
fixed
,
as
if
on
*NL*
duty
;
--
his
look
determined
,
--
clenching
the
sermon
in
his
left
hand
,
like
*NL*
his
firelock
.
--
In
a
word
,
you
would
be
apt
to
paint
Trim
,
as
if
he
was
*NL*
standing
in
his
platoon
ready
for
action
,
--
His
attitude
was
as
unlike
*NL*
all
this
as
you
can
conceive
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
before
them
with
his
body
swayed
,
and
bent
forwards
just
so
*NL*
far
,
as
to
make
an
angle
of
85
degrees
and
a
half
upon
the
plain
of
the
*NL*
horizon
;
--
which
sound
orators
,
to
whom
I
address
this
,
know
very
well
to
*NL*
be
the
true
persuasive
angle
of
incidence
;
--
in
any
other
angle
you
may
*NL*
talk
and
preach
;
--
't
is
certain
;
--
and
it
is
done
every
day
;
--
but
with
*NL*
what
effect
,
--
I
leave
the
world
to
judge
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
necessity
of
this
precise
angle
of
85
degrees
and
a
half
to
a
*NL*
mathematical
exactness
,
--
does
it
not
shew
us
,
by
the
way
,
how
the
arts
*NL*
and
sciences
mutually
befriend
each
other
?
*NL*
*NL*
How
the
duce
Corporal
Trim
,
who
knew
not
so
much
as
an
acute
angle
from
*NL*
an
obtuse
one
,
came
to
hit
it
so
exactly
;
--
or
whether
it
was
chance
or
*NL*
nature
,
or
good
sense
or
imitation
,
&
c.
shall
be
commented
upon
in
that
*NL*
part
of
the
cyclopaedia
of
arts
and
sciences

where
the
instrumental

parts

bar
,
the
*NL*
coffee-house
,
the
bed-chamber
,
and
fire-side
,
fall
under
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
,
--
for
I
repeat
it
,
to
take
the
picture
of
him
in
at
one
view
,
*NL*
with
his
body
swayed
,
and
somewhat
bent
forwards
,
--
his
right
leg
from
*NL*
under
him
,
sustaining
seven-eighths
of
his
whole
weight
,
--
the
foot
of
*NL*
his
left
leg
,
the
defect
of
which
was
no
disadvantage
to
his
attitude
,
*NL*
advanced
a
little
,
--
not
laterally
,
nor
forwards
,
but
in
a
line
betwixt
*NL*
them
;
--
his
knee
bent
,
but
that
not
violently
,
--
but
so
as
to
fall
within
*NL*
the
limits
of
the
line
of
beauty
;
--
and
I
add
,
of
the
line
of
science
*NL*
too
;
--
for
consider
,
it
had
one
eighth
part
of
his
body
to
bear
up
;
--
so
*NL*
that
in
this
case
the
position
of
the
leg
is
determined
,
--
because
the
*NL*
foot
could
be
no
farther
advanced
,
or
the
knee
more
bent
,
than
what
*NL*
would
allow
him
,
mechanically
to
receive
an
eighth
part
of
his
whole
*NL*
weight
under
it
,
and
to
carry
it
too
.
*NL*
*NL*

This
I
recommend
to
painters
;
--
need
I
add
,
--
to
orators
!
--
I
think
not
;
*NL*
for
unless
they
practise
it
,
--
they
must
fall
upon
their
noses
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
for
Corporal
Trim
's
body
and
legs
.
--
He
held
the
sermon
loosely
,
*NL*
not
carelessly
,
in
his
left
hand
,
raised
something
above
his
stomach
,
*NL*
and
detached
a
little
from
his
breast
;
--
his
right
arm
falling
*NL*
negligently
by
his
side
,
as
nature
and
the
laws
of
gravity
ordered
*NL*
it
,
--
but
with
the
palm
of
it
open
and
turned
towards
his
audience
,
ready
*NL*
to
aid
the
sentiment
in
case
it
stood
in
need
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corporal
Trim
's
eyes
and
the
muscles
of
his
face
were
in
full
harmony
*NL*
with
the
other
parts
of
him
;
--
he
looked
frank
,
--
unconstrained
,
--
*NL*
something
assured
,
--
but
not
bordering
upon
assurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
not
the
critic
ask
how
Corporal
Trim
could
come
by
all
this
.
--
I
've
*NL*
told
him
it
should
be
explained
;
--
but
so
he
stood
before
my
father
,
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
and
Dr.
Slop
,
--
so
swayed
his
body
,
so
contrasted
his
limbs
,
*NL*
and
with
such
an
oratorical
sweep
throughout
the
whole
figure
,
--
a
*NL*
statuary
might
have
modelled
from
it
;
--
nay
,
I
doubt
whether
the
oldest
*NL*
Fellow
of
a
College
,
--
or
the
Hebrew
Professor
himself
,
could
have
much
*NL*
mended
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Trim
made
a
bow
,
and
read
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sermon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hebrews
xiii

*NL*

For
we

we
have
a

Conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Trust
!
--
Trust
we
have
a
good
conscience
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Certainly
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
father
,
interrupting
him
,
you
give
that
*NL*
sentence
a
very
improper
accent
;
for
you
curl
up
your
nose
,
man
,
and
*NL*
read
it
with
such
a
sneering
tone
,
as
if
the
Parson
was
going
to
abuse
*NL*
the
Apostle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
,
an

please
your
Honour
,
replied
Trim
.
Pugh
!
said
my
father
,
*NL*
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
Trim
is
certainly
in
the
right
;
for
the
writer
-LRB-
who
*NL*
I
perceive
is
a
Protestant
-RRB-
by
the
snappish
manner
in
which
he
takes
up
*NL*
the
apostle
,
is
certainly
going
to
abuse
him
;
--
if
this
treatment
of
him
*NL*
has
not
done
it
already
.
But
from
whence
,
replied
my
father
,
have
you
*NL*
concluded
so
soon
,
Dr.
Slop
,
that
the
writer
is
of
our
church
?
--
for
*NL*
aught
I
can
see
yet
,
--
he
may
be
of
any
church
.
--
Because
,
answered
Dr.
*NL*
Slop
,
if
he
was
of
ours
,
--
he
durst
no
more
take
such
a
licence
,
--
than
*NL*
a
bear
by
his
beard
:
--
If
,
in
our
communion
,
Sir
,
a
man
was
to
insult
an
*NL*
apostle
,
--
a
saint
,
--
or
even
the
paring
of
a
saint
's
nail
,
--
he
would
have
*NL*
his
eyes
scratched
out
.
--
What
,
by
the
saint
?
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
No
,
*NL*
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
he
would
have
an
old
house
over
his
head
.
Pray
is
*NL*
the
Inquisition
an
ancient
building
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
,
or
is
it
*NL*
a
modern
one
?
--
I
know
nothing
of
architecture
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
.
--
An
'
*NL*
please
your
Honours
,
quoth
Trim
,
the
Inquisition
is
the
vilest
--
Prithee
*NL*
spare
thy
description
,
Trim
,
I
hate
the
very
name
of
it
,
said
my
*NL*
father
.
--
No
matter
for
that
,
answered
Dr.
Slop
,
--
it
has
its
uses
;
for
*NL*
tho
'
I
'm
no
great
advocate
for
it
,
yet
,
in
such
a
case
as
this
,
he
would
*NL*
soon
be
taught
better
manners
;
and
I
can
tell
him
,
if
he
went
on
at
that
*NL*
rate
,
would
be
flung
into
the
Inquisition
for
his
pains
.
God
help
him
*NL*
then
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
Amen
,
added
Trim
;
for
Heaven
above
knows
,
*NL*
I
have
a
poor
brother
who
has
been
fourteen
years
a
captive
in
it
.
--
I
*NL*
never
heard
one
word
of
it
before
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
hastily
:
--
How
*NL*
came
he
there
,
Trim
?
--
O
,
Sir
,
the
story
will
make
your
heart
bleed
,
--
as
*NL*
it
has
made
mine
a
thousand
times
;
--
but
it
is
too
long
to
be
told
*NL*
now
;
--
your
Honour
shall
hear
it
from
first
to
last
some
day
when
I
am
*NL*
working
beside
you
in
our
fortifications
;
--
but
the
short
of
the
story
*NL*
is
this
;
--
That
my
brother
Tom
went
over
a
servant
to
Lisbon
,
--
and
then
*NL*
married
a
Jew
's
widow
,
who
kept
a
small
shop
,
and
sold
sausages
,
which
*NL*
somehow
or
other
,
was
the
cause
of
his
being
taken
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
night
out
of
his
bed
,
where
he
was
lying
with
his
wife
and
two
small
*NL*
children
,
and
carried
directly
to
the
Inquisition
,
where
,
God
help
him
,
*NL*
continued
Trim
,
fetching
a
sigh
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
--
the
poor
*NL*
honest
lad
lies
confined
at
this
hour
;
he
was
as
honest
a
soul
,
added
*NL*
Trim
,
-LRB-
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
-RRB-
as
ever
blood
warmed
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
tears
trickled
down
Trim
's
cheeks
faster
than
he
could
well
wipe
*NL*
them
away
.
--
A
dead
silence
in
the
room
ensued
for
some
minutes
.
--
Certain
*NL*
proof
of
pity
!
*NL*
*NL*
Come
Trim
,
quoth
my
father
,
after
he
saw
the
poor
fellow
's
grief
had
*NL*
got
a
little
vent
,
--
read
on
,
--
and
put
this
melancholy
story
out
of
thy
*NL*
head
:
--
I
grieve
that
I
interrupted
thee
;
but
prithee
begin
the
sermon
*NL*
again
;
--
for
if
the
first
sentence
in
it
is
matter
of
abuse
,
as
thou
*NL*
sayest
,
I
have
a
great
desire
to
know
what
kind
of
provocation
the
*NL*
apostle
has
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corporal
Trim
wiped
his
face
,
and
returned
his
handkerchief
into
his
*NL*
pocket
,
and
,
making
a
bow
as
he
did
it
,
--
he
began
again
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sermon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hebrews
xiii

18
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
we
trust
we
have
a

Conscience
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Trust
!
trust
we
have
a
good
conscience
!
Surely
if
there
is
any
thing
in
*NL*
this
life
which
a
man
may
depend
upon
,
and
to
the
knowledge
of
which
he
*NL*
is
capable
of
arriving
upon
the
most
indisputable
evidence
,
it
must
be
*NL*
this
very
thing
,
--
whether
he
has
a
good
conscience
or
no
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
I
am
positive
I
am
right
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
a
man
thinks
at
all
,
he
can
not
well
be
a
stranger
to
the
true
state
*NL*
of
this
account
:
--
he
must
be
privy
to
his
own
thoughts
and
desires
;
--
he
*NL*
must
remember
his
past
pursuits
,
and
know
certainly
the
true
springs
and
*NL*
motives
,
which
,
in
general
,
have
governed
the
actions
of
his
life
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
I
defy
him
,
without
an
assistant
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
other
matters
we
may
be
deceived
by
false
appearances
;
and
,
as
the
*NL*
wise
man
complains
,
hardly
do
we
guess
aright
at
the
things
that
are
*NL*
upon
the
earth
,
and
with
labour
do
we
find
the
things
that
are
before
*NL*
us
.
But
here
the
mind
has
all
the
evidence
and
facts
within
herself
;
--
is
*NL*
conscious
of
the
web
she
has
wove
;
--
knows
its
texture
and
fineness
,
and
*NL*
the
exact
share
which
every
passion
has
had
in
working
upon
the
several
*NL*
designs
which
virtue
or
vice
has
planned
before
her
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
The
language
is
good
,
and
I
declare
Trim
reads
very
well
,
quoth
my
*NL*
father
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
--
as
conscience
is
nothing
else
but
the
knowledge
which
the
mind
*NL*
has
within
herself
of
this
;
and
the
judgment
,
either
of
approbation
or
*NL*
censure
,
which
it
unavoidably
makes
upon
the
successive
actions
of
*NL*
our
lives
;
't
is
plain
you
will
say
,
from
the
very
terms
of
the
*NL*
proposition
,
--
whenever
this
inward
testimony
goes
against
a
man
,
and
he
*NL*
stands
self-accused
,
that
he
must
necessarily
be
a
guilty
man
.
--
And
,
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
when
the
report
is
favourable
on
his
side
,
and
his
heart
*NL*
condemns
him
not
:
--
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
trust
,
as
the
apostle
*NL*
intimates
,
but
a
matter
of
certainty
and
fact
,
that
the
conscience
is
*NL*
good
,
and
that
the
man
must
be
good
also
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
Then
the
apostle
is
altogether
in
the
wrong
,
I
suppose
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
*NL*
and
the
Protestant
divine
is
in
the
right
.
Sir
,
have
patience
,
replied
*NL*
my
father
,
for
I
think
it
will
presently
appear
that
St.
Paul
and
the
*NL*
Protestant
divine
are
both
of
an
opinion
.
--
As
nearly
so
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
*NL*
as
east
is
to
west
;
--
but
this
,
continued
he
,
lifting
both
hands
,
comes
*NL*
from
the
liberty
of
the
press
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
no
more
at
the
worst
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
than
the
liberty
of
*NL*
the
pulpit
;
for
it
does
not
appear
that
the
sermon
is
printed
,
or
ever
*NL*
likely
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Go
on
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
father
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
first
sight
this
may
seem
to
be
a
true
state
of
the
case
:
and
I
make
*NL*
no
doubt
but
the
knowledge
of
right
and
wrong
is
so
truly
impressed
*NL*
upon
the
mind
of
man
,
--
that
did
no
such
thing
ever
happen
,
as
that
the
*NL*
conscience
of
a
man
,
by
long
habits
of
sin
,
might
-LRB-
as
the
scripture
*NL*
assures
it
may
-RRB-
insensibly
become
hard
;
--
and
,
like
some
tender
parts
of
*NL*
his
body
,
by
much
stress
and
continual
hard
usage
,
lose
by
degrees
that
*NL*
nice
sense
and
perception
with
which
God
and
nature
endowed
it
:
--
Did
*NL*
this
never
happen
;
--
or
was
it
certain
that
self-love
could
never
hang
*NL*
the
least
bias
upon
the
judgment
;
--
or
that
the
little
interests
below
*NL*
could
rise
up
and
perplex
the
faculties
of
our
upper
regions
,
and
*NL*
encompass
them
about
with
clouds
and
thick
darkness
:
--
Could
no
such
*NL*
thing
as
favour
and
affection
enter
this
sacred
Court
--
Did
Wit
disdain
*NL*
to
take
a
bribe
in
it
;
--
or
was
ashamed
to
shew
its
face
as
an
advocate
*NL*
for
an
unwarrantable
enjoyment
:
Or
,
lastly
,
were
we
assured
that
*NL*
Interest
stood
always
unconcerned
whilst
the
cause
was
hearing
--
and
that
*NL*
Passion
never
got
into
the
judgment-seat
,
and
pronounced
sentence
in
the
*NL*
stead
of
Reason
,
which
is
supposed
always
to
preside
and
determine
upon
*NL*
the
case
:
--
Was
this
truly
so
,
as
the
objection
must
suppose
;
--
no
doubt
*NL*
then
the
religious
and
moral
state
of
a
man
would
be
exactly
what
he
*NL*
himself
esteemed
it
:
--
and
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
every
man
's
life
*NL*
could
be
known
,
in
general
,
by
no
better
measure
,
than
the
degrees
of
*NL*
his
own
approbation
and
censure
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
own
,
in
one
case
,
whenever
a
man
's
conscience
does
accuse
him
-LRB-
as
it
*NL*
seldom
errs
on
that
side
-RRB-
that
he
is
guilty
;
--
and
unless
in
melancholy
*NL*
and
hypocondriac
cases
,
we
may
safely
pronounce
upon
it
,
that
there
is
*NL*
always
sufficient
grounds
for
the
accusation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
the
converse
of
the
proposition
will
not
hold
true
;
--
namely
,
that
*NL*
whenever
there
is
guilt
,
the
conscience
must
accuse
;
and
if
it
does
not
,
*NL*
that
a
man
is
therefore
innocent
.
--
This
is
not
fact
--
So
that
the
common
*NL*
consolation
which
some
good
christian
or
other
is
hourly
administering
*NL*
to
himself
,
--
that
he
thanks
God
his
mind
does
not
misgive
him
;
and
that
,
*NL*
consequently
,
he
has
a
good
conscience
,
because
he
hath
a
quiet
one
,
--
is
*NL*
fallacious
;
--
and
as
current
as
the
inference
is
,
and
as
infallible
as
*NL*
the
rule
appears
at
first
sight
,
yet
when
you
look
nearer
to
it
,
and
try
*NL*
the
truth
of
this
rule
upon
plain
facts
,
--
you
see
it
liable
to
so
much
*NL*
error
from
a
false
application
;
--
the
principle
upon
which
it
goes
so
*NL*
often
perverted
;
--
the
whole
force
of
it
lost
,
and
sometimes
so
vilely
*NL*
cast
away
,
that
it
is
painful
to
produce
the
common
examples
from
human
*NL*
life
,
which
confirm
the
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
man
shall
be
vicious
and
utterly
debauched
in
his
*NL*
principles
;
--
exceptionable
in
his
conduct
to
the
world
;
shall
live
*NL*
shameless
,
in
the
open
commission
of
a
sin
which
no
reason
or
pretence
*NL*
can
justify
,
--
a
sin
by
which
,
contrary
to
all
the
workings
of
humanity
,
*NL*
he
shall
ruin
for
ever
the
deluded
partner
of
his
guilt
;
--
rob
her
of
her
*NL*
best
dowry
;
and
not
only
cover
her
own
head
with
dishonour
;
--
but
involve
*NL*
a
whole
virtuous
family
in
shame
and
sorrow
for
her
sake
.
Surely
,
you
*NL*
will
think
conscience
must
lead
such
a
man
a
troublesome
life
;
he
can
*NL*
have
no
rest
night
and
day
from
its
reproaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Alas
!
Conscience
had
something
else
to
do
all
this
time
,
than
break
*NL*
in
upon
him
;
as
Elijah
reproached
the
god
Baal
,
--
this
domestic
god
was
*NL*
either
talking
,
or
pursuing
,
or
was
in
a
journey
,
or
peradventure
he
*NL*
slept
and
could
not
be
awoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
He
was
gone
out
in
company
with
Honour
to
fight
a
duel
:
to
*NL*
pay
off
some
debt
at
play
;

or
dirty
annuity
,
the
bargain
of
his
lust
;
*NL*
Perhaps
Conscience
all
this
time
was
engaged
at
home
,
talking
aloud
*NL*
against
petty
larceny
,
and
executing
vengeance
upon
some
such
puny
*NL*
crimes
as
his
fortune
and
rank
of
life
secured
him
against
all
*NL*
temptation
of
committing
;
so
that
he
lives
as
merrily

Dr.

turning

It

replied
my

too
often

I
own
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
*NL*
-LRB-
struck
a
little
with
my
father
's
frank
acknowledgment
-RRB-
--
that
a
man
*NL*
in
the
Romish
church
may
live
as
badly
;

but
then
he
can
not
easily
*NL*
die
so
.

'T
is
little
matter
,
replied
my
father
,
with
an
air
of
*NL*
indifference
,
--
how
a
rascal
dies
.
--
I
mean
,
answered
Dr.
Slop
,
he
would
*NL*
be
denied
the
benefits
of
the
last
sacraments

Pray
how
many
have
you
*NL*
in

said
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
for
I
always
forget
?

Seven

answered
*NL*
Dr.
Slop
.
--
Humph
!
--
said
my
uncle
Toby
;
tho
'
not
accented
as
a
note
of
*NL*
acquiescence
,
--
but
as
an
interjection
of
that
particular
species
of
*NL*
surprize
,
when
a
man
in
looking
into
a
drawer
,
finds
more
of
a
thing
*NL*
than
he
expected
.
--
Humph
!
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
Dr.
Slop
,
who
had
an
*NL*
ear

understood
my

Toby
as
well
as
if
he
had
wrote
a
whole
volume
*NL*
against
the
seven

Humph

replied
Dr.
Slop
,
-LRB-
stating
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
argument
over
again
to
him
-RRB-

Why
,
Sir

are
there
not
seven
*NL*
cardinal
virtues
?
--
Seven
mortal
sins
?

Seven
golden
candlesticks

'T
is
more
than
I
know

my

Toby

Are
there

not
seven
wonders
of

Seven

of
the
creation

Seven
*NL*

Seven
plagues

quoth
my

with
a
most
*NL*
affected
gravity
.
But

continued
he
,

on
with
the

Trim

waved

a

strait-hearted

selfish
wretch

incapable
either
of

Take
notice
how
he
passes
by
the
widow

-LRB-
An

cried
Trim

up

When

calls
him
to
look
back
upon
this

black
account

state
it
over
again
with
his
conscience

Conscience

looks
into
the

finds
no
express
law
broken
by
what

done

perceives
no

goods

incurred

sees
no
scourge
waving
over
his
head

prison
opening
his

gates
upon
him
:

What
is
there
to
affright
his
conscience

Conscience

has
got
safely
entrenched
behind
the
Letter

sits
there
*NL*
invulnerable

fortified
with
Cases

strongly
on

-LRB-
Here
Corporal

looks

Aye

my

shaking
his

these

are

Trim

O

very
poor
work

answered
Trim
,
*NL*
to
what
your
Honour

I
make
of
it
.

The
character
of
this
last
man
,
*NL*
said
Dr.
Slop
,
interrupting
Trim
,
is
more
detestable
than
all
the
rest
;
*NL*
and
seems
to
have
been
taken
from
some
pettifogging
Lawyer
amongst
*NL*
you
:

Amongst

a
man

conscience
could
not
possibly
continue
so
long
*NL*
blinded
,
--
three
times
in
a

at

,
he
must
go
to
confession

*NL*
Will
that
restore
it
to

my

Go
on

*NL*
my

back

the

end

thy
sermon

'T

a
very
short
one

replied
Trim
.
--
I
wish
it
was
*NL*
longer

my

Toby
,
for
I

Trim

on

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
fourth
man
shall
want
even
this
refuge
;
--
shall
break
through
all
*NL*
their
ceremony
of
slow
chicane
;
--
scorns
the
doubtful
workings
of
*NL*
secret
plots
and
cautious
trains
to
bring
about
his
purpose

See
*NL*
the
bare-faced
villain
,
how
he
cheats
,
lies
,
perjures
,
robs
,
*NL*
murders
!
--
Horrid
!

But
indeed
much
better
was
not
to
be
expected
,
in
*NL*
the
present
case
--
the
poor
man
was
in
the
dark
!
--
his
priest
had
got
the
*NL*
keeping
of
his
conscience
;
--
and
all
he
would
let
him
know
of
it
,
was
,
*NL*
That
he
must
believe
in
the
Pope
;
--
go
to
Mass
;
--
cross
himself
;
--
tell
his
*NL*
beads
;
--
be
a
good
Catholic
,
and
that
this
,
in
all
conscience
,
was
enough
*NL*
to
carry
him
to
heaven
.
What
;
--
if
he
perjures
?
--
Why
;
--
he
had
a
mental
*NL*
reservation
in
it
.
--
But
if
he
is
so
wicked
and
abandoned
a
wretch
as
you
*NL*
represent
him
;
--
if
he
robs
,
--
if
he
stabs
,
will
not
conscience
,
on
every
*NL*
such
act
,
receive
a
wound
itself
?
--
Aye
,
--
but
the
man
has
carried
it
to
*NL*
confession
;
--
the
wound
digests
there
,
and
will
do
well
enough
,
and
in
a
*NL*
short
time
be
quite
healed
up
by
absolution
.
O
Popery
!
what
hast
thou
to
*NL*
answer
for
!
--
when
not
content
with
the
too
many
natural
and
fatal
ways
,
*NL*
thro
'
which
the
heart
of
man
is
every
day
thus
treacherous
to
itself
*NL*
above
all
things
;
--
thou
hast
wilfully
set
open
the
wide
gate
of
deceit
*NL*
before
the
face
of
this
unwary
traveller
,
too
apt
,
God
knows
,
to
go
*NL*
astray
of
himself
,
and
confidently
speak
peace
to
himself
,
when
there
is
*NL*
no
peace

*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
this
the
common
instances
which
I
have
drawn
out
of
life
,
are
too
*NL*
notorious
to
require
much
evidence
.
If
any
man
doubts
the
reality
*NL*
of
them
,
or
thinks
it
impossible
for
a
man
to
be
such
a
bubble
to
*NL*
himself
,
--
I
must
refer
him
a
moment
to
his
own
reflections
,
and
will
*NL*
then
venture
to
trust
my
appeal
with
his
own
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
him
consider
in
how
different
a
degree
of
detestation
,
numbers
of
*NL*
wicked
actions
stand
there
,
tho
'
equally
bad
and
vicious
in
their
own
*NL*
natures
;
--
he
will
soon
find
,
that
such
of
them
as
strong
inclination
*NL*
and
custom
have
prompted
him
to
commit
,
are
generally
dressed
out
and
*NL*
painted
with
all
the
false
beauties
which
a
soft
and
a
flattering
hand
*NL*
can
give
them
;
--
and
that
the
others
,
to
which
he
feels
no
propensity
,
*NL*
appear
,
at
once
,
naked
and
deformed
,
surrounded
with
all
the
true
*NL*
circumstances
of
folly
and
dishonour
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
David
surprized
Saul
sleeping
in
the
cave
,
and
cut
off
the
skirt
*NL*
of
his
robe
--
we
read
his
heart
smote
him
for
what
he
had
done
:
--
But
in
*NL*
the
matter
of
Uriah
,
where
a
faithful
and
gallant
servant
,
whom
he
*NL*
ought
to
have
loved
and
honoured
,
fell
to
make
way
for
his
lust
,
--
where
*NL*
conscience
had
so
much
greater
reason
to
take
the
alarm
,
his
heart
smote
*NL*
him
not
.
A
whole
year
had
almost
passed
from
first
commission
of
that
*NL*
crime
,
to
the
time
Nathan
was
sent
to
reprove
him
;
and
we
read
not
once
*NL*
of
the
least
sorrow
or
compunction
of
heart
which
he
testified
,
during
*NL*
all
that
time
,
for
what
he
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thus
conscience
,
this
once
able
monitor
,
--
placed
on
high
as
a
judge
*NL*
within
us
,
and
intended
by
our
maker
as
a
just
and
equitable
one
*NL*
too
,
--
by
an
unhappy
train
of
causes
and
impediments
,
takes
often
*NL*
such
imperfect
cognizance
of
what
passes
,
--
does
its
office
so
*NL*
negligently
,
--
sometimes
so
corruptly
,
--
that
it
is
not
to
be
trusted
*NL*
alone
;
and
therefore
we
find
there
is
a
necessity
,
an
absolute
*NL*
necessity
,
of
joining
another
principle
with
it
,
to
aid
,
if
not
govern
,
*NL*
its
determinations
.
*NL*

`
So
that
if

form
a
just
judgment
of
what
is
of
infinite
*NL*
importance
to
you
not
to
be
misled
in

namely
,
in
what
degree
of
real
*NL*
merit
you
stand
either
as
an
honest
man
,
an
useful
citizen
,
a
faithful

subject

your

or
a
good
servant
to
your

in
religion

Look

What
is

what

`
Let
Conscience
determine
the
matter

then

if

A

in

darkest
doubts
it

conduct

safer

a

give
the
state
he
lives
in

a
better
*NL*
security
for
his
behaviour
than
all
the
causes
and
restrictions
put
*NL*
together
,
which
law-makers
are
forced
to
multiply
:
--
Forced
,
I
say
,
as
*NL*
things
stand
;
human
laws
not
being
a
matter
of
original
choice
,
but
of
*NL*
pure
necessity
,
brought
in
to
fence
against
the
mischievous
effects
of
*NL*
those
consciences
which
are
no
law
unto
themselves
;
well
intending
,
by
*NL*
the
many
provisions
made
,
--
that
in
all
such
corrupt
and
misguided
*NL*
cases
,
where
principles
and
the
checks
of
conscience
will
not
make
*NL*
us
upright
,
--
to
supply
their
force
,
and
,
by
the
terrors
of
gaols
and
*NL*
halters
,
oblige
us
to
it

*NL*
-LRB-
I
see
plainly
,
said
my
father
,
that
this
sermon
has
been
composed
to
be
*NL*
preached
at
the
Temple
,
--
or
at
some
Assize
.
--
I
like
the
reasoning
,
--
and
*NL*
am
sorry
that
Dr.
Slop
has
fallen
asleep
before
the
time
of
his
*NL*
conviction
:
--
for
it
is
now
clear
,
that
the
Parson
,
as
I
thought
at
*NL*
first
,
never
insulted
St.
Paul
in
the
least
;
--
nor
has
there
been
,
*NL*
brother
,
the
least
difference
between
them
.
--
A
great
matter
,
if
they
*NL*
had
differed
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
the
best
friends
in
the
world
may
*NL*
differ
sometimes
.
--
True
,
--
brother
Toby
quoth
my
father
,
shaking
hands
*NL*
with
him
,
--
we
'll
fill
our
pipes
,
brother
,
and
then
Trim
shall
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
--
what
dost
thou
think
of
it
?
said
my
father
,
speaking
to
Corporal
*NL*
Trim
,
as
he
reached
his
tobacco-box
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
,
answered
the
Corporal
,
that
the
seven
watch-men
upon
the
tower
,
*NL*
who
,
I
suppose
,
are
all
centinels
there
,
--
are
more
,
an
'
please
your
*NL*
Honour
,
than
were
necessary
;
--
and
,
to
go
on
at
that
rate
,
would
harrass
*NL*
a
regiment
all
to
pieces
,
which
a
commanding
officer
,
who
loves
his
*NL*
men
,
will
never
do
,
if
he
can
help
it
,
because
two
centinels
,
added
*NL*
the
Corporal
,
are
as
good
as
twenty
.
--
I
have
been
a
commanding
officer
*NL*
myself
in
the
Corps
de
Garde
a
hundred
times
,
continued
Trim
,
rising
*NL*
an
inch
higher
in
his
figure
,
as
he
spoke
,
--
and
all
the
time
I
had
*NL*
the
honour
to
serve
his
Majesty
King
William
,
in
relieving
the
most
*NL*
considerable
posts
,
I
never
left
more
than
two
in
my
life
.
--
Very
right
,
*NL*
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
but
you
do
not
consider
,
Trim
,
that
the
*NL*
towers
,
in
Solomon
's
days
,
were
not
such
things
as
our
bastions
,
*NL*
flanked
and
defended
by
other
works
;
--
this
,
Trim
,
was
an
invention
since
*NL*
Solomon
's
death
;
nor
had
they
horn-works
,
or
ravelins
before
the
curtin
,
*NL*
in
his
time
;
--
or
such
a
fosse
as
we
make
with
a
cuvette
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
it
,
and
with
covered
ways
and
counterscarps
pallisadoed
along
it
,
to
*NL*
guard
against
a
Coup
de
main
:
--
So
that
the
seven
men
upon
the
tower
were
*NL*
a
party
,
I
dare
say
,
from
the
Corps
de
Garde
,
set
there
,
not
only
to
*NL*
look
out
,
but
to
defend
it
.
--
They
could
be
no
more
,
an
'
please
your
*NL*
Honour
,
than
a
Corporal
's
Guard
.
--
My
father
smiled
inwardly
,
but
not
*NL*
outwardly
--
the
subject
being
rather
too
serious
,
considering
what
had
*NL*
happened
,
to
make
a
jest
of
.
--
So
putting
his
pipe
into
his
mouth
,
which
*NL*
he
had
just
lighted
,
--
he
contented
himself
with
ordering
Trim
to
read
*NL*
on
.
He
read
on
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
have
the
fear
of
God
before
our
eyes
,
and
,
in
our
mutual
dealings
*NL*
with
each
other
,
to
govern
our
actions
by
the
eternal
measures
of
*NL*
right
and
wrong
:
--
The
first
of
these
will
comprehend
the
duties
of
*NL*
religion
;
--
the
second
,
those
of
morality
,
which
are
so
inseparably
*NL*
connected
together
,
that
you
can
not
divide
these
two
tables
,
even
*NL*
in
imagination
,
-LRB-
tho
'
the
attempt
is
often
made
in
practice
-RRB-
without
*NL*
breaking
and
mutually
destroying
them
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
the
attempt
is
often
made
;
and
so
it
is
;
--
there
being
nothing
*NL*
more
common
than
to
see
a
man
who
has
no
sense
at
all
of
religion
,
and
*NL*
indeed
has
so
much
honesty
as
to
pretend
to
none
,
who
would
take
it
as
*NL*
the
bitterest
affront
,
should
you
but
hint
at
a
suspicion
of
his
moral
*NL*
character
,
--
or
imagine
he
was
not
conscientiously
just
and
scrupulous
to
*NL*
the
uttermost
mite
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
there
is
some
appearance
that
it
is
so
,
--
tho
'
one
is
unwilling
*NL*
even
to
suspect
the
appearance
of
so
amiable
a
virtue
as
moral
honesty
,
*NL*
yet
were
we
to
look
into
the
grounds
of
it
,
in
the
present
case
,
I
am
*NL*
persuaded
we
should
find
little
reason
to
envy
such
a
one
the
honour
of
*NL*
his
motive
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Let
him
declaim
as
pompously
as
he
chooses
upon
the
subject
,
it
will
*NL*
be
found
to
rest
upon
no
better
foundation
than
either
his
interest
,
his
*NL*
pride
,
his
ease
,
or
some
such
little
and
changeable
passion
as
will
give
*NL*
us
but
small
dependence
upon
his
actions
in
matters
of
great
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
illustrate
this
by
an
example
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
know
the
banker
I
deal
with
,
or
the
physician
I
usually
call
*NL*
in
,
'
--
-LRB-
There
is
no
need
,
cried
Dr.
Slop
,
-LRB-
waking
-RRB-
to
call
in
any
*NL*
physician
in
this
case
-RRB-
--
`
to
be
neither
of
them
men
of
much
religion
:
I
*NL*
hear
them
make
a
jest
of
it
every
day
,
and
treat
all
its
sanctions
with
*NL*
so
much
scorn
,
as
to
put
the
matter
past
doubt
.
Well
;
--
notwithstanding
*NL*
this
,
I
put
my
fortune
into
the
hands
of
the
one
:
--
and
what
is
dearer
*NL*
still
to
me
,
I
trust
my
life
to
the
honest
skill
of
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
let
me
examine
what
is
my
reason
for
this
great
confidence
.
Why
,
in
*NL*
the
first
place
,
I
believe
there
is
no
probability
that
either
of
them
*NL*
will
employ
the
power
I
put
into
their
hands
to
my
disadvantage
;
--
I
*NL*
consider
that
honesty
serves
the
purposes
of
this
life
:
--
I
know
their
*NL*
success
in
the
world
depends
upon
the
fairness
of
their
characters
.
--
In
*NL*
a
word
,
I
'm
persuaded
that
they
can
not
hurt
me
without
hurting
*NL*
themselves
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
put
it
otherwise
,
namely
,
that
interest
lay
,
for
once
,
on
the
other
*NL*
side
;
that
a
case
should
happen
,
wherein
the
one
,
without
stain
to
*NL*
his
reputation
,
could
secrete
my
fortune
,
and
leave
me
naked
in
the
*NL*
world
;
--
or
that
the
other
could
send
me
out
of
it
,
and
enjoy
an
estate
*NL*
by
my
death
,
without
dishonour
to
himself
or
his
art
:
--
In
this
case
,
*NL*
what
hold
have
I
of
either
of
them
?
--
Religion
,
the
strongest
of
all
*NL*
motives
,
is
out
of
the
question
;
--
Interest
,
the
next
most
powerful
*NL*
motive
in
the
world
,
is
strongly
against
me
:
--
What
have
I
left
to
*NL*
cast
into
the
opposite
scale
to
balance
this
temptation
?
--
Alas
!
I
have
*NL*
nothing
,
--
nothing
but
what
is
lighter
than
a
bubble
--
I
must
lie
at
the
*NL*
mercy
of
Honour
,
or
some
such
capricious
principle
--
Strait
security
for
*NL*
two
of
the
most
valuable
blessings
!
--
my
property
and
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
,
therefore
,
we
can
have
no
dependence
upon
morality
without
*NL*
religion
;
--
so
,
on
the
other
hand
,
there
is
nothing
better
to
be
expected
*NL*
from
religion
without
morality
;
nevertheless
,
't
is
no
prodigy
to
see
a
*NL*
man
whose
real
moral
character
stands
very
low
,
who
yet
entertains
the
*NL*
highest
notion
of
himself
in
the
light
of
a
religious
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
shall
not
only
be
covetous
,
revengeful
,
implacable
,
--
but
even
*NL*
wanting
in
points
of
common
honesty
;
yet
inasmuch
as
he
talks
aloud
*NL*
against
the
infidelity
of
the
age
,
--
is
zealous
for
some
points
of
*NL*
religion
,
--
goes
twice
a
day
to
church
,
--
attends
the
sacraments
,
--
and
*NL*
amuses
himself
with
a
few
instrumental
parts
of
religion
,
--
shall
cheat
*NL*
his
conscience
into
a
judgment
,
that
,
for
this
,
he
is
a
religious
man
,
*NL*
and
has
discharged
truly
his
duty
to
God
:
And
you
will
find
that
such
a
*NL*
man
,
through
force
of
this
delusion
,
generally
looks
down
with
spiritual
*NL*
pride
upon
every
other
man
who
has
less
affectation
of
piety
,
--
though
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
ten
times
more
real
honesty
than
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
likewise
is
a
sore
evil
under
the
sun
;
and
I
believe
,
there
is
no
*NL*
one
mistaken
principle
,
which
,
for
its
time
,
has
wrought
more
serious
*NL*
mischiefs
.
--
For
a
general
proof
of
this
,
--
examine
the
history
of
the
*NL*
Romish
church
;
'
--
-LRB-
Well
what
can
you
make
of
that
?
cried
Dr.
Slop
-RRB-
--
`
see
*NL*
what
scenes
of
cruelty
,
murder
,
rapine
,
bloodshed
,

-LRB-
They
may
thank
*NL*
their
own
obstinacy
,
cried
Dr.
Slop
-RRB-
--
have
all
been
sanctified
by
a
*NL*
religion
not
strictly
governed
by
morality

*NL*
`
In
how
many
kingdoms

-LRB-
Here
Trim
kept
waving
his
*NL*
right-hand
from
the
sermon
to
the
extent
of
his
arm
,
returning
it
*NL*
backwards
and
forwards
to
the
conclusion
of
the
paragraph
.

*NL*
`
In
how
many
kingdoms
of

the
crusading
sword
of
this
*NL*
misguided
saint-errant
,
spared
neither
age
or
merit
,
or
sex
,
or
*NL*
condition
?
--
and
,
as
he
fought
under
the
banners
of
a
religion
which
*NL*
set
him
loose
from
justice
and
humanity
,
he
shewed
none
;
mercilessly
*NL*
trampled
upon
both
,
--
heard
neither
the
cries
of
the
unfortunate
,
nor
*NL*
pitied
their
distresses

*NL*
-LRB-
I
have
been
in

a

quoth
Trim
,
*NL*
sighing
,
but
never
in
so
melancholy
a
one
as
this
,
--
I
would
not
have
*NL*
drawn
a
tricker
in
it
against
these
poor
souls
,
--
to
have
been
made
a
*NL*
general
officer
.
--
Why
?
what
do
you
understand
of
the
affair
?
said
Dr.
*NL*
Slop
,
looking
towards
Trim
,
with
something
more
of
contempt
than
the
*NL*
Corporal
's
honest
heart
deserved
.
--
What
do
you
know
,
friend
,
about
this
*NL*
battle
you
talk
of
?
--
I
know
,
replied
Trim
,
that
I
never
refused
quarter
*NL*
in
my
life
to
any
man
who
cried
out
for
it
;
--
but
to
a
woman
or
a
child
,
*NL*
continued
Trim
,
before
I
would
level
my
musket
at
them
,
I
would
loose
*NL*
my
life
a
thousand
times
.

Here

for
thee
,
Trim
,
to
drink
with

my

I
'll

another

too

your

replied
Trim

I
had
rather
these
poor

women

children
had
it
.

thou
art
an
honest

quoth
my
uncle

Toby

My
father
nodded
his
head
,
as
much
as
to
say

and
so
he
is
.

*NL*
*NL*
But
prithee
,
Trim
,
said
my
father
,
make
an
end

I

thou

a

If
the

Behold
this

delivered
up

so
wasted
with
*NL*
sorrow

confinement

-LRB-
Oh
!
't
is
my
brother
,
cried
poor
Trim
in
a
*NL*
most
passionate
exclamation
,
dropping
the
sermon
upon
the
ground
,
and
*NL*
clapping
his
hands
together
--
I
fear
't
is
poor
Tom
.
My
father
's
and
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
heart
yearned
with
sympathy
for
the
poor
fellow
's
distress
;
*NL*
even
Slop
himself
acknowledged
pity
for
him
.
--
Why
,
Trim
,
said
my
father
,
*NL*
this
is
not
a
history
,
--
't
is
a
sermon
thou
art
reading

prithee
begin
*NL*
the
sentence
again

-RRB-

`
Behold
this
helpless

delivered
up
to
his

his
body
so
wasted
with
sorrow
and
confinement

you
will
*NL*
see
every
nerve
and
muscle
as
it
suffers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Observe
the
last
movement
of
that
horrid
engine
!
'
--
-LRB-
I
would
rather
face
*NL*
a
cannon
,
quoth
Trim
,
stamping
.
-RRB-
--
`
See
what
convulsions
it
has
thrown
*NL*
him
into
!

Consider
the
nature

exquisite
tortures
he

how

-LRB-
I
would
not
read
another

quoth
Trim
for
all
this

;
--
I
fear
,
an
'
please
your
*NL*
Honours
,
all
this
is
in
Portugal
,
where
my
poor
brother
Tom
is
.
I
*NL*
tell
thee
,
Trim
,
again
,
quoth
my
father
,
't
is
not
an
historical
*NL*
account
,
--
't
is
a
description
.
--
'T
is
only
a
description
,
honest
man
,
*NL*
quoth
Slop
,
there
's
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
.
--
That
's
another
*NL*
story
,
replied
my
father
.
--
However
,
as
Trim
reads
it
with
so
much
*NL*
concern
,
--
't
is
cruelty
to
force
him
to
go
on
with
it
.
--
Give
me
hold
of
*NL*
the
sermon
,
Trim
,
--
I
'll
finish
it
for
thee
,
and
thou
may
`
st
go
.
I
must
*NL*
stay
and
hear
it
too
,
replied
Trim
,
if
your
Honour
will
allow
me
;
--
tho
'
*NL*
I
would
not
read
it
myself
for
a
Colonel
's
pay
.
--
Poor
Trim
!
quoth
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
.
My
father
went
on
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
Consider
the
nature
of
the
posture
in
which
he
now
lies
*NL*
stretched
,
--
what
exquisite
torture
he
endures
by
it
!
--
'T
is
all
nature
*NL*
can
bear
!
Good
God
!
See
how
it
keeps
his
weary
soul
hanging
upon
*NL*
his
trembling
lips
,
--
willing
to
take
its
leave
,
--
but
not
suffered
to
*NL*
depart
!
--
Behold
the
unhappy
wretch
led
back
to
his
cell
!
'
--
-LRB-
Then
,
thank
*NL*
God
,
however
,
quoth
Trim
,
they
have
not
killed
him
.
-RRB-
--
`
See
him
dragged
*NL*
out
of
it
again
to
meet
the
flames
,
and
the
insults
in
his
last
agonies
,
*NL*
which
this
principle
,
--
this
principle
,
that
there
can
be
religion
*NL*
without
mercy
,
has
prepared
for
him
.
'
--
-LRB-
Then
,
thank
God
,
--
he
is
dead
,
*NL*
quoth
Trim
,
--
he
is
out
of
his
pain
,
--
and
they
have
done
their
worst
at
*NL*
him
.
--
O
Sirs
!
--
Hold
your
peace
,
Trim
,
said
my
father
,
going
on
with
the
*NL*
sermon
,
lest
Trim
should
incense
Dr.
Slop
,
--
we
shall
never
have
done
at
*NL*
this
rate
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
surest
way
to
try
the
merit
of
any
disputed
notion
is
,
to
trace
*NL*
down
the
consequences
such
a
notion
has
produced
,
and
compare
them
with
*NL*
the
spirit
of
Christianity
;
--
't
is
the
short
and
decisive
rule
which
our
*NL*
Saviour
hath
left
us
,
for
these
and
such
like
cases
,
and
it
is
worth
a
*NL*
thousand
arguments
--
By
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
add
no
farther
to
the
length
of
this
sermon
,
than
by
two
or
*NL*
three
short
and
independent
rules
deducible
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
First
,
Whenever
a
man
talks
loudly
against
religion
,
always
suspect
*NL*
that
it
is
not
his
reason
,
but
his
passions
,
which
have
got
the
*NL*
better
of
his
Creed
.
A
bad
life
and
a
good
belief
are
disagreeable
and
*NL*
troublesome
neighbours
,
and
where
they
separate
,
depend
upon
it
,
't
is
*NL*
for
no
other
cause
but
quietness
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Secondly
,
When
a
man
,
thus
represented
,
tells
you
in
any
particular
*NL*
instance
,
--
That
such
a
thing
goes
against
his
conscience
,
--
always
*NL*
believe
he
means
exactly
the
same
thing
,
as
when
he
tells
you
such
*NL*
a
thing
goes
against
his
stomach
;
--
a
present
want
of
appetite
being
*NL*
generally
the
true
cause
of
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
a
word
,
--
trust
that
man
in
nothing
,
who
has
not
a
Conscience
in
*NL*
every
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
,
in
your
own
case
,
remember
this
plain
distinction
,
a
mistake
in
*NL*
which
has
ruined
thousands
,
--
that
your
conscience
is
not
a
law
;
--
No
,
*NL*
God
and
reason
made
the
law
,
and
have
placed
conscience
within
you
to
*NL*
determine
;
--
not
,
like
an
Asiatic
Cadi
,
according
to
the
ebbs
and
flows
*NL*
of
his
own
passions
,
--
but
like
a
British
judge
in
this
land
of
liberty
*NL*
and
good
sense
,
who
makes
no
new
law
,
but
faithfully
declares
that
law
*NL*
which
he
knows
already
written
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Finis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thou
hast
read
the
sermon
extremely
well
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
father
.
--
If
he
*NL*
had
spared
his
comments
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
--
he
would
have
read
it
much
*NL*
better
.
I
should
have
read
it
ten
times
better
,
Sir
,
answered
Trim
,
but
*NL*
that
my
heart
was
so
full
.
--
That
was
the
very
reason
,
Trim
,
replied
my
*NL*
father
,
which
has
made
thee
read
the
sermon
as
well
as
thou
hast
done
;
*NL*
and
if
the
clergy
of
our
church
,
continued
my
father
,
addressing
himself
*NL*
to
Dr.
Slop
,
would
take
part
in
what
they
deliver
as
deeply
as
this
poor
*NL*
fellow
has
done
,
--
as
their
compositions
are
fine
;
--
-LRB-
I
deny
it
,
quoth
*NL*
Dr.
Slop
-RRB-
--
I
maintain
it
,
--
that
the
eloquence
of
our
pulpits
,
with
such
*NL*
subjects
to
enflame
it
,
would
be
a
model
for
the
whole
world
:
--
But
alas
!
*NL*
continued
my
father
,
and
I
own
it
,
Sir
,
with
sorrow
,
that
,
like
French
*NL*
politicians
in
this
respect
,
what
they
gain
in
the
cabinet
they
lose
in
*NL*
the
field
.
--
`
Twere
a
pity
,
quoth
my
uncle
,
that
this
should
be
lost
.
I
*NL*
like
the
sermon
well
,
replied
my
father
,
--
't
is
dramatick
,
--
and
there
is
*NL*
something
in
that
way
of
writing
,
when
skilfully
managed
,
which
catches
*NL*
the
attention
.
--
We
preach
much
in
that
way
with
us
,
said
Dr.
Slop
.
--
I
*NL*
know
that
very
well
,
said
my
father
,
--
but
in
a
tone
and
manner
which
*NL*
disgusted
Dr.
Slop
,
full
as
much
as
his
assent
,
simply
,
could
have
*NL*
pleased
him
.
--
But
in
this
,
added
Dr.
Slop
,
a
little
piqued
,
--
our
sermons
*NL*
have
greatly
the
advantage
,
that
we
never
introduce
any
character
*NL*
into
them
below
a
patriarch
or
a
patriarch
's
wife
,
or
a
martyr
or
a
*NL*
saint
.
--
There
are
some
very
bad
characters
in
this
,
however
,
said
my
*NL*
father
,
and
I
do
not
think
the
sermon
a
jot
the
worse
for
'em
.
--
But
*NL*
pray
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
who
's
can
this
be
?
--
How
could
it
get
into
my
*NL*
Stevinus
?
A
man
must
be
as
great
a
conjurer
as
Stevinus
,
said
my
*NL*
father
,
to
resolve
the
second
question
:
--
The
first
,
I
think
,
is
not
*NL*
so
difficult
;
--
for
unless
my
judgment
greatly
deceives
me
,
--
I
know
the
*NL*
author
,
for
't
is
wrote
,
certainly
,
by
the
parson
of
the
parish
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
similitude
of
the
stile
and
manner
of
it
,
with
those
my
father
*NL*
constantly
had
heard
preached
in
his
parish-church
,
was
the
ground
of
*NL*
his
conjecture
,
--
proving
it
as
strongly
,
as
an
argument
a
priori
could
*NL*
prove
such
a
thing
to
a
philosophic
mind
,
That
it
was
Yorick
's
and
no
*NL*
one
's
else
:
--
It
was
proved
to
be
so
,
a
posteriori
,
the
day
after
,
when
*NL*
Yorick
sent
a
servant
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
to
enquire
after
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
that
Yorick
,
who
was
inquisitive
after
all
kinds
of
knowledge
,
*NL*
had
borrowed
Stevinus
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
had
carelesly
popped
his
*NL*
sermon
,
as
soon
as
he
had
made
it
,
into
the
middle
of
Stevinus
;
and
*NL*
by
an
act
of
forgetfulness
,
to
which
he
was
ever
subject
,
he
had
sent
*NL*
Stevinus
home
,
and
his
sermon
to
keep
him
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ill-fated
sermon
!
Thou
wast
lost
,
after
this
recovery
of
thee
,
a
second
*NL*
time
,
dropped
thru
'
an
unsuspected
fissure
in
thy
master
's
pocket
,
down
*NL*
into
a
treacherous
and
a
tattered
lining
,
--
trod
deep
into
the
dirt
by
*NL*
the
left
hind-foot
of
his
Rosinante
inhumanly
stepping
upon
thee
as
*NL*
thou
falledst
;
--
buried
ten
days
in
the
mire
,
--
raised
up
out
of
it
by
*NL*
a
beggar
,
--
sold
for
a
halfpenny
to
a
parish-clerk
,
--
transferred
to
*NL*
his
parson
,
--
lost
for
ever
to
thy
own
,
the
remainder
of
his
days
,
--
nor
*NL*
restored
to
his
restless
Manes
till
this
very
moment
,
that
I
tell
the
*NL*
world
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
Can
the
reader
believe
,
that
this
sermon
of
Yorick
's
was
preached
at
an
*NL*
assize
,
in
the
cathedral
of
York
,
before
a
thousand
witnesses
,
ready
to
*NL*
give
oath
of
it
,
by
a
certain
prebendary
of
that
church
,
and
actually
*NL*
printed
by
him
when
he
had
done
,
--
and
within
so
short
a
space
as
two
*NL*
years
and
three
months
after
Yorick
's
death
?
--
Yorick
indeed
,
was
never
*NL*
better
served
in
his
life
;
--
but
it
was
a
little
hard
to
maltreat
him
*NL*
after
,
and
plunder
him
after
he
was
laid
in
his
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
the
gentleman
who
did
it
was
in
perfect
charity
with
*NL*
Yorick
,
--
and
,
in
conscious
justice
,
printed
but
a
few
copies
to
give
*NL*
away
;
--
and
that
I
am
told
he
could
moreover
have
made
as
good
a
one
*NL*
himself
,
had
he
thought
fit
,
--
I
declare
I
would
not
have
published
this
*NL*
anecdote
to
the
world
;
--
nor
do
I
publish
it
with
an
intent
to
hurt
his
*NL*
character
and
advancement
in
the
church
;
--
I
leave
that
to
others
;
--
but
I
*NL*
find
myself
impelled
by
two
reasons
,
which
I
can
not
withstand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
is
,
That
in
doing
justice
,
I
may
give
rest
to
Yorick
's
*NL*
ghost
;
--
which
--
as
the
country-people
,
and
some
others
believe
,
--
still
*NL*
walks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
reason
is
,
That
,
by
laying
open
this
story
to
the
world
,
*NL*
I
gain
an
opportunity
of
informing
it
,
--
That
in
case
the
character
of
*NL*
parson
Yorick
,
and
this
sample
of
his
sermons
,
is
liked
,
--
there
are
now
*NL*
in
the
possession
of
the
Shandy
family
,
as
many
as
will
make
a
handsome
*NL*
volume
,
at
the
world
's
service
,
--
and
much
good
may
they
do
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
Obadiah
gained
the
two
crowns
without
dispute
;
--
for
he
came
in
jingling
,
*NL*
with
all
the
instruments
in
the
green
baize
bag
we
spoke
of
,
flung
*NL*
across
his
body
,
just
as
Corporal
Trim
went
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
now
proper
,
I
think
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
-LRB-
clearing
up
his
looks
-RRB-
as
*NL*
we
are
in
a
condition
to
be
of
some
service
to
Mrs.
Shandy
,
to
send
up
*NL*
stairs
to
know
how
she
goes
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
ordered
,
answered
my
father
,
the
old
midwife
to
come
down
to
us
*NL*
upon
the
least
difficulty
;
--
for
you
must
know
,
Dr.
Slop
,
continued
my
*NL*
father
,
with
a
perplexed
kind
of
a
smile
upon
his
countenance
,
that
by
*NL*
express
treaty
,
solemnly
ratified
between
me
and
my
wife
,
you
are
no
*NL*
more
than
an
auxiliary
in
this
affair
,
--
and
not
so
much
as
that
,
--
unless
*NL*
the
lean
old
mother
of
a
midwife
above
stairs
can
not
do
without
*NL*
you
.
--
Women
have
their
particular
fancies
,
and
in
points
of
this
nature
,
*NL*
continued
my
father
,
where
they
bear
the
whole
burden
,
and
suffer
so
*NL*
much
acute
pain
for
the
advantage
of
our
families
,
and
the
good
of
*NL*
the
species
,
--
they
claim
a
right
of
deciding
,
en
Souveraines
,
in
whose
*NL*
hands
,
and
in
what
fashion
,
they
choose
to
undergo
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
are
in
the
right
of
it
,

quoth
my

Toby
.
But
Sir
,
replied
Dr.
*NL*
Slop
,
not
taking
notice
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
opinion
,
but
turning
to
my
*NL*
father
,
--
they
had
better
govern
in
other
points
;
--
and
a
father
of
a
*NL*
family
,
who
wishes
its
perpetuity
,
in
my
opinion
,
had
better
exchange
*NL*
this
prerogative
with
them
,
and
give
up
some
other
rights
in
lieu
of
*NL*
it
.
--
I
know
not
,
quoth
my
father
,
answering
a
letter
too
testily
,
to
be
*NL*
quite
dispassionate
in
what
he
said
,
--
I
know
not
,
quoth
he
,
what
we
have
*NL*
left
to
give
up
,
in
lieu
of
who
shall
bring
our
children
into
the
world
,
*NL*
unless
that
,
--
of
who
shall
beget
them
.
--
One
would
almost
give
up
*NL*
any
thing
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
.
--
I
beg
your
pardon
,
--
answered
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
.
--
Sir
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
it
would
astonish
you
to
know
what
*NL*
improvements
we
have
made
of
late
years
in
all
branches
of
obstetrical
*NL*
knowledge
,
but
particularly
in
that
one
single
point
of
the
safe
and
*NL*
expeditious
extraction
of
the
foetus
,
--
which
has
received
such
lights
,
*NL*
that
,
for
my
part
-LRB-
holding
up
his
hand
-RRB-
I
declare
I
wonder
how
the
world
*NL*
has
--
I
wish
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
you
had
seen
what
prodigious
armies
we
*NL*
had
in
Flanders

*NL*
*NL*
I
have
dropped
the
curtain
over
this
scene
for
a
minute
,
--
to
remind
you
*NL*
of
one
thing
,
--
and
to
inform
you
of
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
have
to
inform
you
,
comes
,
I
own
,
a
little
out
of
its
due
*NL*
course
;
--
for
it
should
have
been
told
a
hundred
and
fifty
pages
ago
,
*NL*
but
that
I
foresaw
then
`
twould
come
in
pat
hereafter
,
and
be
of
more
*NL*
advantage
here
than
elsewhere
.
--
Writers
had
need
look
before
them
,
to
*NL*
keep
up
the
spirit
and
connection
of
what
they
have
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
two
things
are
done
,
--
the
curtain
shall
be
drawn
up
again
,
*NL*
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
my
father
,
and
Dr.
Slop
,
shall
go
on
with
their
*NL*
discourse
,
without
any
more
interruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
then
,
the
matter
which
I
have
to
remind
you
of
,
is
this
;
--
that
*NL*
from
the
specimens
of
singularity
in
my
father
's
notions
in
the
point
of
*NL*
Christian-names
,
and
that
other
previous
point
thereto
,
--
you
was
led
,
I
*NL*
think
,
into
an
opinion
,
--
-LRB-
and
I
am
sure
I
said
as
much
-RRB-
that
my
father
*NL*
was
a
gentleman
altogether
as
odd
and
whimsical
in
fifty
other
opinions
.
*NL*
In
truth
,
there
was
not
a
stage
in
the
life
of
man
,
from
the
very
first
*NL*
act
of
his
begetting
,
--
down
to
the
lean
and
slippered
pantaloon
in
*NL*
his
second
childishness
,
but
he
had
some
favourite
notion
to
himself
,
*NL*
springing
out
of
it
,
as
sceptical
,
and
as
far
out
of
the
high-way
of
*NL*
thinking
,
as
these
two
which
have
been
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Mr.
Shandy
,
my
father
,
Sir
,
would
see
nothing
in
the
light
in
which
*NL*
others
placed
it
;
--
he
placed
things
in
his
own
light
;
--
he
would
weigh
*NL*
nothing
in
common
scales
;
--
no
,
he
was
too
refined
a
researcher
to
lie
*NL*
open
to
so
gross
an
imposition
.
--
To
come
at
the
exact
weight
of
things
*NL*
in
the
scientific
steel-yard
,
the
fulcrum
,
he
would
say
,
should
be
*NL*
almost
invisible
,
to
avoid
all
friction
from
popular
tenets
;
--
without
*NL*
this
the
minutiae
of
philosophy
,
which
would
always
turn
the
balance
,
*NL*
will
have
no
weight
at
all
.
Knowledge
,
like
matter
,
he
would
affirm
,
*NL*
was
divisible
in
infinitum
;
--
that
the
grains
and
scruples
were
as
much
a
*NL*
part
of
it
,
as
the
gravitation
of
the
whole
world
.
--
In
a
word
,
he
*NL*
would
say
,
error
was
error
,
--
no
matter
where
it
fell
,
--
whether
in
a
*NL*
fraction
,
--
or
a
pound
,
--
't
was
alike
fatal
to
truth
,
and
she
was
kept
*NL*
down
at
the
bottom
of
her
well
,
as
inevitably
by
a
mistake
in
the
dust
*NL*
of
a
butterfly
's
wing
,
--
as
in
the
disk
of
the
sun
,
the
moon
,
and
all
the
*NL*
stars
of
heaven
put
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
often
lament
that
it
was
for
want
of
considering
this
properly
,
*NL*
and
of
applying
it
skilfully
to
civil
matters
,
as
well
as
to
speculative
*NL*
truths
,
that
so
many
things
in
this
world
were
out
of
joint
;
--
that
the
*NL*
political
arch
was
giving
way
;
--
and
that
the
very
foundations
of
our
*NL*
excellent
constitution
in
church
and
state
,
were
so
sapped
as
estimators
*NL*
had
reported
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
cry
out
,
he
would
say
,
we
are
a
ruined
,
undone
people
.
Why
?
he
would
*NL*
ask
,
making
use
of
the
sorites
or
syllogism
of
Zeno
and
Chrysippus
,
*NL*
without
knowing
it
belonged
to
them
.
--
Why
?
why
are
we
a
ruined
*NL*
people
?
--
Because
we
are
corrupted
.
--
Whence
is
it
,
dear
Sir
,
that
we
*NL*
are
corrupted
?
--
Because
we
are
needy
;
--
our
poverty
,
and
not
our
wills
,
*NL*
consent
.
--
And
wherefore
,
he
would
add
,
are
we
needy
?
--
From
the
neglect
,
*NL*
he
would
answer
,
of
our
pence
and
our
halfpence
:
--
Our
bank
notes
,
Sir
,
*NL*
our
guineas
,
--
nay
our
shillings
take
care
of
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
the
same
,
he
would
say
,
throughout
the
whole
circle
of
the
*NL*
sciences
;
--
the
great
,
the
established
points
of
them
,
are
not
to
*NL*
be
broke
in
upon
.
--
The
laws
of
nature
will
defend
themselves
;
--
but
*NL*
error
--
-LRB-
he
would
add
,
looking
earnestly
at
my
mother
-RRB-
--
error
,
Sir
,
*NL*
creeps
in
thro
'
the
minute
holes
and
small
crevices
which
human
nature
*NL*
leaves
unguarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
turn
of
thinking
in
my
father
,
is
what
I
had
to
remind
you
of
:
--
The
*NL*
point
you
are
to
be
informed
of
,
and
which
I
have
reserved
for
this
*NL*
place
,
is
as
follows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amongst
the
many
and
excellent
reasons
,
with
which
my
father
had
urged
*NL*
my
mother
to
accept
of
Dr.
Slop
's
assistance
preferably
to
that
of
the
*NL*
old
woman
,
--
there
was
one
of
a
very
singular
nature
;
which
,
when
he
had
*NL*
done
arguing
the
matter
with
her
as
a
Christian
,
and
came
to
argue
it
*NL*
over
again
with
her
as
a
philosopher
,
he
had
put
his
whole
strength
to
,
*NL*
depending
indeed
upon
it
as
his
sheet-anchor
.
--
It
failed
him
,
tho
'
from
*NL*
no
defect
in
the
argument
itself
;
but
that
,
do
what
he
could
,
he
was
*NL*
not
able
for
his
soul
to
make
her
comprehend
the
drift
of
it
.
--
Cursed
*NL*
luck
!
--
said
he
to
himself
,
one
afternoon
,
as
he
walked
out
of
the
room
,
*NL*
after
he
had
been
stating
it
for
an
hour
and
a
half
to
her
,
to
no
*NL*
manner
of
purpose
;
--
cursed
luck
!
said
he
,
biting
his
lip
as
he
shut
the
*NL*
door
,
--
for
a
man
to
be
master
of
one
of
the
finest
chains
of
reasoning
*NL*
in
nature
,
--
and
have
a
wife
at
the
same
time
with
such
a
head-piece
,
*NL*
that
he
can
not
hang
up
a
single
inference
within
side
of
it
,
to
save
his
*NL*
soul
from
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
argument
,
though
it
was
entirely
lost
upon
my
mother
,
--
had
more
*NL*
weight
with
him
,
than
all
his
other
arguments
joined
together
:
--
I
will
*NL*
therefore
endeavour
to
do
it
justice
,
--
and
set
it
forth
with
all
the
*NL*
perspicuity
I
am
master
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
set
out
upon
the
strength
of
these
two
following
axioms
:
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
That
an
ounce
of
a
man
's
own
wit
,
was
worth
a
ton
of
other
*NL*
people
's
;
and
,
*NL*
*NL*
Secondly
,
-LRB-
Which
by
the
bye
,
was
the
ground-work
of
the
first
*NL*
axiom
,
--
tho
'
it
comes
last
-RRB-
That
every
man
's
wit
must
come
from
every
*NL*
man
's
own
soul
,
--
and
no
other
body
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
it
was
plain
to
my
father
,
that
all
souls
were
by
nature
*NL*
equal
,
--
and
that
the
great
difference
between
the
most
acute
and
the
*NL*
most
obtuse
understanding
--
was
from
no
original
sharpness
or
bluntness
*NL*
of
one
thinking
substance
above
or
below
another
,
--
but
arose
merely
from
*NL*
the
lucky
or
unlucky
organization
of
the
body
,
in
that
part
where
the
*NL*
soul
principally
took
up
her
residence
,
--
he
had
made
it
the
subject
of
*NL*
his
enquiry
to
find
out
the
identical
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
from
the
best
accounts
he
had
been
able
to
get
of
this
matter
,
he
*NL*
was
satisfied
it
could
not
be
where
Des
Cartes
had
fixed
it
,
upon
the
*NL*
top
of
the
pineal
gland
of
the
brain
;
which
,
as
he
philosophized
,
formed
*NL*
a
cushion
for
her
about
the
size
of
a
marrow
pea
;
tho
'
to
speak
the
*NL*
truth
,
as
so
many
nerves
did
terminate
all
in
that
one
place
,
--
't
was
*NL*
no
bad
conjecture
;
--
and
my
father
had
certainly
fallen
with
that
great
*NL*
philosopher
plumb
into
the
centre
of
the
mistake
,
had
it
not
been
for
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
,
who
rescued
him
out
of
it
,
by
a
story
he
told
him
of
a
*NL*
Walloon
officer
at
the
battle
of
Landen
,
who
had
one
part
of
his
brain
*NL*
shot
away
by
a
musket-ball
,
--
and
another
part
of
it
taken
out
after
by
*NL*
a
French
surgeon
;
and
after
all
,
recovered
,
and
did
his
duty
very
well
*NL*
without
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
death
,
said
my
father
,
reasoning
with
himself
,
is
nothing
but
the
*NL*
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
body
;
--
and
if
it
is
true
that
people
can
*NL*
walk
about
and
do
their
business
without
brains
,
--
then
certes
the
soul
*NL*
does
not
inhabit
there
.
Q.E.D.
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
that
certain
,
very
thin
,
subtle
and
very
fragrant
juice
which
*NL*
Coglionissimo
Borri
,
the
great
Milaneze
physician
affirms
,
in
a
letter
*NL*
to
Bartholine
,
to
have
discovered
in
the
cellulae
of
the
occipital
parts
*NL*
of
the
cerebellum
,
and
which
he
likewise
affirms
to
be
the
principal
*NL*
seat
of
the
reasonable
soul
,
-LRB-
for
,
you
must
know
,
in
these
latter
and
*NL*
more
enlightened
ages
,
there
are
two
souls
in
every
man
living
,
--
the
*NL*
one
,
according
to
the
great
Metheglingius
,
being
called
the
Animus
,
the
*NL*
other
,
the
Anima
;-RRB-
--
as
for
the
opinion
,
I
say
of
Borri
,
--
my
father
*NL*
could
never
subscribe
to
it
by
any
means
;
the
very
idea
of
so
noble
,
so
*NL*
refined
,
so
immaterial
,
and
so
exalted
a
being
as
the
Anima
,
or
even
the
*NL*
Animus
,
taking
up
her
residence
,
and
sitting
dabbling
,
like
a
tad-pole
*NL*
all
day
long
,
both
summer
and
winter
,
in
a
puddle
,
--
or
in
a
liquid
*NL*
of
any
kind
,
how
thick
or
thin
soever
,
he
would
say
,
shocked
his
*NL*
imagination
;
he
would
scarce
give
the
doctrine
a
hearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
,
therefore
,
seemed
the
least
liable
to
objections
of
any
,
was
that
*NL*
the
chief
sensorium
,
or
head-quarters
of
the
soul
,
and
to
which
place
*NL*
all
intelligences
were
referred
,
and
from
whence
all
her
mandates
were
*NL*
issued
,
--
was
in
,
or
near
,
the
cerebellum
,
--
or
rather
somewhere
about
the
*NL*
medulla
oblongata
,
wherein
it
was
generally
agreed
by
Dutch
anatomists
,
*NL*
that
all
the
minute
nerves
from
all
the
organs
of
the
seven
senses
*NL*
concentered
,
like
streets
and
winding
alleys
,
into
a
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
there
was
nothing
singular
in
my
father
's
opinion
,
--
he
had
*NL*
the
best
of
philosophers
,
of
all
ages
and
climates
,
to
go
along
with
*NL*
him
.
--
But
here
he
took
a
road
of
his
own
,
setting
up
another
Shandean
*NL*
hypothesis
upon
these
corner-stones
they
had
laid
for
him
;
--
and
which
*NL*
said
hypothesis
equally
stood
its
ground
;
whether
the
subtilty
and
*NL*
fineness
of
the
soul
depended
upon
the
temperature
and
clearness
of
*NL*
the
said
liquor
,
or
of
the
finer
net-work
and
texture
in
the
cerebellum
*NL*
itself
;
which
opinion
he
favoured
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
maintained
,
that
next
to
the
due
care
to
be
taken
in
the
act
of
*NL*
propagation
of
each
individual
,
which
required
all
the
thought
in
the
*NL*
world
,
as
it
laid
the
foundation
of
this
incomprehensible
contexture
,
*NL*
in
which
wit
,
memory
,
fancy
,
eloquence
,
and
what
is
usually
meant
by
*NL*
the
name
of
good
natural
parts
,
do
consist
;
--
that
next
to
this
and
his
*NL*
Christian-name
,
which
were
the
two
original
and
most
efficacious
causes
*NL*
of
all
;
--
that
the
third
cause
,
or
rather
what
logicians
call
the
Causa
*NL*
sina
qua
non
,
and
without
which
all
that
was
done
was
of
no
manner
of
*NL*
significance
,
--
was
the
preservation
of
this
delicate
and
fine-spun
*NL*
web
,
from
the
havock
which
was
generally
made
in
it
by
the
violent
*NL*
compression
and
crush
which
the
head
was
made
to

by
the
*NL*
nonsensical
method
of
bringing
us
into
the
world
by
that
foremost
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
requires
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
who
dipped
into
all
kinds
of
books
,
upon
looking
into
*NL*
Lithopaedus
Senonesis
de
Portu
difficili
,
-LRB-
The
author
is
here
twice
*NL*
mistaken
;
for
Lithopaedus
should
be
wrote
thus
,
Lithopaedii
Senonensis
*NL*
Icon
.
The
second
mistake
is
,
that
this
Lithopaedus
is
not
an
author
,
*NL*
but
a
drawing
of
a
petrified
child
.
The
account
of
this
,
published
by
*NL*
Athosius
1580
,
may
be
seen
at
the
end
of
Cordaeus
's
works
in
Spachius
.
*NL*
Mr.
Tristram
Shandy
has
been
led
into
this
error
,
either
from
seeing
*NL*
Lithopaedus
's
name
of
late
in
a
catalogue
of
learned
writers
in
Dr.
.
.
,
*NL*
or
by
mistaking
Lithopaedus
for
Trinecavellius
,
--
from
the
too
great
*NL*
similitude
of
the
names
.
-RRB-
published
by
Adrianus
Smelvgot
,
had
found
out
,
*NL*
that
the
lax
and
pliable
state
of
a
child
's
head
in
parturition
,
the
*NL*
bones
of
the
cranium
having
no
sutures
at
that
time
,
was
such
,
--
that
by
*NL*
force
of
the
woman
's
efforts
,
which
,
in
strong
labour-pains
,
was
*NL*
equal
,
upon
an
average
,
to
the
weight
of
470
pounds
avoirdupois
acting
*NL*
perpendicularly
upon
it
;
--
it
so
happened
,
that
in
49
instances
out
of
*NL*
50
,
the
said
head
was
compressed
and
moulded
into
the
shape
of
an
oblong
*NL*
conical
piece
of
dough
,
such
as
a
pastry-cook
generally
rolls
up
in
*NL*
order
to
make
a
pye
of
.
--
Good
God
!
cried
my
father
,
what
havock
and
*NL*
destruction
must
this
make
in
the
infinitely
fine
and
tender
texture
of
*NL*
the
cerebellum
!
--
Or
if
there
is
such
a
juice
as
Borri
pretends
--
is
it
*NL*
not
enough
to
make
the
clearest
liquid
in
the
world
both
seculent
and
*NL*
mothery
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
great
was
his
apprehension
,
when
he
farther
understood
,
that
*NL*
this
force
acting
upon
the
very
vertex
of
the
head
,
not
only
injured
*NL*
the
brain
itself
,
or
cerebrum
,
--
but
that
it
necessarily
squeezed
and
*NL*
propelled
the
cerebrum
towards
the
cerebellum
,
which
was
the
immediate
*NL*
seat
of
the
understanding
!
--
Angels
and
ministers
of
grace
defend
us
!
*NL*
cried
my
father
,
--
can
any
soul
withstand
this
shock
?
--
No
wonder
the
*NL*
intellectual
web
is
so
rent
and
tattered
as
we
see
it
;
and
that
so
*NL*
many
of
our
best
heads
are
no
better
than
a
puzzled
skein
of
silk
,
--
all
*NL*
perplexity
,
--
all
confusion
within-side
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
my
father
read
on
,
and
was
let
into
the
secret
,
that
when
a
*NL*
child
was
turned
topsy-turvy
,
which
was
easy
for
an
operator
to
do
,
and
*NL*
was
extracted
by
the
feet
;
--
that
instead
of
the
cerebrum
being
propelled
*NL*
towards
the
cerebellum
,
the
cerebellum
,
on
the
contrary
,
was
propelled
*NL*
simply
towards
the
cerebrum
,
where
it
could
do
no
manner
of
hurt
:
--
By
*NL*
heavens
!
cried
he
,
the
world
is
in
conspiracy
to
drive
out
what
little
*NL*
wit
God
has
given
us
,
--
and
the
professors
of
the
obstetric
art
are
*NL*
listed
into
the
same
conspiracy
.
--
What
is
it
to
me
which
end
of
my
son
*NL*
comes
foremost
into
the
world
,
provided
all
goes
right
after
,
and
his
*NL*
cerebellum
escapes
uncrushed
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
nature
of
an
hypothesis
,
when
once
a
man
has
conceived
it
,
*NL*
that
it
assimilates
every
thing
to
itself
,
as
proper
nourishment
;
and
,
*NL*
from
the
first
moment
of
your
begetting
it
,
it
generally
grows
the
*NL*
stronger
by
every
thing
you
see
,
hear
,
read
,
or
understand
.
This
is
of
*NL*
great
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
father
was
gone
with
this
about
a
month
,
there
was
scarce
a
*NL*
phaenomenon
of
stupidity
or
of
genius
,
which
he
could
not
readily
solve
*NL*
by
it
;
--
it
accounted
for
the
eldest
son
being
the
greatest
blockhead
in
*NL*
the
family
.
--
Poor
devil
,
he
would
say
,
--
he
made
way
for
the
capacity
of
*NL*
his
younger
brothers
.
--
It
unriddled
the
observations
of
drivellers
and
*NL*
monstrous
heads
,
--
shewing
a
priori
,
it
could
not
be
otherwise
,
--
unless
...
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
.
It
wonderfully
explained
and
accounted
for
the
*NL*
acumen
of
the
Asiatic
genius
,
and
that
sprightlier
turn
,
and
a
more
*NL*
penetrating
intuition
of
minds
,
in
warmer
climates
;
not
from
the
*NL*
loose
and
common-place
solution
of
a
clearer
sky
,
and
a
more
perpetual
*NL*
sunshine
,
&
c.
--
which
for
aught
he
knew
,
might
as
well
rarefy
and
dilute
*NL*
the
faculties
of
the
soul
into
nothing
,
by
one
extreme
,
--
as
they
are
*NL*
condensed
in
colder
climates
by
the
other
;
--
but
he
traced
the
affair
up
*NL*
to
its
spring-head
;
--
shewed
that
,
in
warmer
climates
,
nature
had
laid
*NL*
a
lighter
tax
upon
the
fairest
parts
of
the
creation
;
--
their
pleasures
*NL*
more
;
--
the
necessity
of
their
pains
less
,
insomuch
that
the
pressure
and
*NL*
resistance
upon
the
vertex
was
so
slight
,
that
the
whole
organization
*NL*
of
the
cerebellum
was
preserved
;
--
nay
,
he
did
not
believe
,
in
natural
*NL*
births
,
that
so
much
as
a
single
thread
of
the
net-work
was
broke
or
*NL*
displaced
,
--
so
that
the
soul
might
just
act
as
she
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
father
had
got
so
far
,
--
what
a
blaze
of
light
did
the
accounts
*NL*
of
the
Caesarian
section
,
and
of
the
towering
geniuses
who
had
come
safe
*NL*
into
the
world
by
it
,
cast
upon
this
hypothesis
?
Here
you
see
,
he
would
*NL*
say
,
there
was
no
injury
done
to
the
sensorium
;
--
no
pressure
of
the
*NL*
head
against
the
pelvis
;
--
no
propulsion
of
the
cerebrum
towards
the
*NL*
cerebellum
,
either
by
the
os
pubis
on
this
side
,
or
os
coxygis
on
*NL*
that
;
--
and
pray
,
what
were
the
happy
consequences
?
Why
,
Sir
,
your
Julius
*NL*
Caesar
,
who
gave
the
operation
a
name
;
--
and
your
Hermes
Trismegistus
,
*NL*
who
was
born
so
before
ever
the
operation
had
a
name
;
--
your
Scipio
*NL*
Africanus
;
your
Manlius
Torquatus
;
our
Edward
the
Sixth
,
--
who
,
had
he
*NL*
lived
,
would
have
done
the
same
honour
to
the
hypothesis
:
--
These
,
and
*NL*
many
more
who
figured
high
in
the
annals
of
fame
,
--
all
came
side-way
,
*NL*
Sir
,
into
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
incision
of
the
abdomen
and
uterus
ran
for
six
weeks
together
in
*NL*
my
father
's
head
;
--
he
had
read
,
and
was
satisfied
,
that
wounds
in
the
*NL*
epigastrium
,
and
those
in
the
matrix
,
were
not
mortal
;
--
so
that
the
*NL*
belly
of
the
mother
might
be
opened
extremely
well
to
give
a
passage
to
*NL*
the
child
.
--
He
mentioned
the
thing
one
afternoon
to
my
mother
,
--
merely
*NL*
as
a
matter
of
fact
;
but
seeing
her
turn
as
pale
as
ashes
at
the
very
*NL*
mention
of
it
,
as
much
as
the
operation
flattered
his
hopes
,
--
he
*NL*
thought
it
as
well
to
say
no
more
of
it
,
--
contenting
himself
with
*NL*
admiring
,
--
what
he
thought
was
to
no
purpose
to
propose
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
my
father
Mr.
Shandy
's
hypothesis
;
concerning
which
I
have
only
*NL*
to
add
,
that
my
brother
Bobby
did
as
great
honour
to
it
-LRB-
whatever
he
did
*NL*
to
the
family
-RRB-
as
any
one
of
the
great
heroes
we
spoke
of
:
For
happening
*NL*
not
only
to
be
christened
,
as
I
told
you
,
but
to
be
born
too
,
when
my
*NL*
father
was
at
Epsom
,
--
being
moreover
my
mother
's
first
child
,
--
coming
*NL*
into
the
world
with
his
head
foremost
,
--
and
turning
out
afterwards
a
lad
*NL*
of
wonderful
slow
parts
,
--
my
father
spelt
all
these
together
into
his
*NL*
opinion
:
and
as
he
had
failed
at
one
end
,
--
he
was
determined
to
try
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
to
be
expected
from
one
of
the
sisterhood
,
who
are
not
*NL*
easily
to
be
put
out
of
their
way
,
--
and
was
therefore
one
of
my
father
's
*NL*
great
reasons
in
favour
of
a
man
of
science
,
whom
he
could
better
deal
*NL*
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
men
in
the
world
,
Dr.
Slop
was
the
fittest
for
my
father
's
*NL*
purpose
;
--
for
though
this
new-invented
forceps
was
the
armour
he
*NL*
had
proved
,
and
what
he
maintained
to
be
the
safest
instrument
of
*NL*
deliverance
,
yet
,
it
seems
,
he
had
scattered
a
word
or
two
in
his
book
,
*NL*
in
favour
of
the
very
thing
which
ran
in
my
father
's
fancy
;
--
tho
'
not
*NL*
with
a
view
to
the
soul
's
good
in
extracting
by
the
feet
,
as
was
my
*NL*
father
's
system
,
--
but
for
reasons
merely
obstetrical
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
will
account
for
the
coalition
betwixt
my
father
and
Dr.
Slop
,
*NL*
in
the
ensuing
discourse
,
which
went
a
little
hard
against
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
.
--
In
what
manner
a
plain
man
,
with
nothing
but
common
sense
,
could
*NL*
bear
up
against
two
such
allies
in
science
,
--
is
hard
to
conceive
.
--
You
*NL*
may
conjecture
upon
it
,
if
you
please
,
--
and
whilst
your
imagination
is
*NL*
in
motion
,
you
may
encourage
it
to
go
on
,
and
discover
by
what
causes
*NL*
and
effects
in
nature
it
could
come
to
pass
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
got
his
*NL*
modesty
by
the
wound
he
received
upon
his
groin
.
--
You
may
raise
a
system
*NL*
to
account
for
the
loss
of
my
nose
by
marriage-articles
,
--
and
shew
*NL*
the
world
how
it
could
happen
,
that
I
should
have
the
misfortune
to
be
*NL*
called
Tristram
,
in
opposition
to
my
father
's
hypothesis
,
and
the
wish
*NL*
of
the
whole
family
,
Godfathers
and
Godmothers
not
excepted
.
--
These
,
*NL*
with
fifty
other
points
left
yet
unravelled
,
you
may
endeavour
to
solve
*NL*
if
you
have
time
;
--
but
I
tell
you
beforehand
it
will
be
in
vain
,
for
*NL*
not
the
sage
Alquise
,
the
magician
in
Don
Belianis
of
Greece
,
nor
the
*NL*
no
less
famous
Urganda
,
the
sorceress
his
wife
,
-LRB-
were
they
alive
-RRB-
could
*NL*
pretend
to
come
within
a
league
of
the
truth
.

The

a

these
*NL*
matters
till
the
next

a

laid

My

did
Dr.

a
disservice
which
his

never

intended
any
man
,

Sir

it
confounded
him
--
and
thereby
putting
his
ideas
*NL*
first
into
confusion
,

then
to
flight

he
could
not
rally
them
again
*NL*

In

male

whether
for

it
makes
no
difference

nothing

more
*NL*
dangerous
,
Madam

than
a
wish
coming
sideways
in
this
unexpected
manner
*NL*
upon
a
man
:
the
safest
way
in
general
to
take
off
the
force
of
the
wish
,
*NL*
is
for
the
party
wish
'd
at

instantly
to
get
upon
his
legs

and
wish
the
*NL*
wisher
something
in

of
pretty
near
the

value

so
balancing
*NL*
the
account

spot

you
stand
as
you
were

nay
sometimes
gain
the
*NL*
advantage
of

attack

it

*NL*
*NL*
This
will
be
fully
illustrated
to
the
world
in
my

of

*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Slop
did
not
understand
the
nature
of
this
defence
;
--
he
was
puzzled
*NL*
with
it
,
and
it
put
an
entire
stop
to
the
dispute
for
four
minutes
and
a
*NL*
half
;
--
five
had
been
fatal
to
it
:
--
my
father
saw
the
danger
--
the
dispute
*NL*
was
one
of
the
most
interesting
disputes
in
the
world
,
`
Whether
the
*NL*
child
of
his
prayers
and
endeavours
should
be
born
without
a
head
or
*NL*
with
one
:
'
--
he
waited
to
the
last
moment
,
to
allow
Dr.
Slop
,
in
whose
*NL*
behalf
the
wish
was
made
,
his
right
of
returning
it
;
but
perceiving
,
I
*NL*
say
,
that
he
was
confounded
,
and
continued
looking
with
that
perplexed
*NL*
vacuity
of
eye
which
puzzled
souls
generally
stare
with
--
first
in
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
face

then
in
his

then
up

then
down

then
east

east

*NL*
by
east

so
on

coasting
it
along
by
the
plinth
of
the
wainscot
*NL*
till
he
had
got
to
the
opposite
point
of
the
compass
,
--
and
that
he
had
*NL*
actually
begun
to
count
the
brass
nails
upon
the
arm
of
his
chair
,
--
my
*NL*
father
thought
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
with
my
uncle
Toby
,
so
took
*NL*
up
the
discourse
as

What
prodigious
armies
you
had
in
Flanders
!

*NL*
*NL*
Brother
Toby
,
replied
my
father
,
taking
his
wig
from
off
his
head
*NL*
with
his
right
hand
,
and
with
his
left
pulling
out
a
striped
India
*NL*
handkerchief
from
his
right
coat
pocket
,
in
order
to
rub
his
head
,
as
he
*NL*
argued
the
point
with
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
,
in
this
I
think
my
father
was
much
to
blame
;
and
I
will
give
you
*NL*
my
reasons
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matters
of
no
more
seeming
consequence
in
themselves
than
,
`
Whether
my
*NL*
father
should
have
taken
off
his
wig
with
his
right
hand
or
with
his
*NL*
left
,
'
--
have
divided
the
greatest
kingdoms
,
and
made
the
crowns
of
the
*NL*
monarchs
who
governed
them
,
to
totter
upon
their
heads
.
--
But
need
I
tell
*NL*
you
,
Sir
,
that
the
circumstances
with
which
every
thing
in
this
world
*NL*
is
begirt
,
give
every
thing
in
this
world
its
size
and
shape
!
--
and
by
*NL*
tightening
it
,
or
relaxing
it
,
this
way
or
that
,
make
the
thing
to
be
,
*NL*
what
it
is
--
great
--
little
--
good
--
bad
--
indifferent
or
not
indifferent
,
*NL*
just
as
the
case
happens
?
*NL*
*NL*
As
my
father
's
India
handkerchief
was
in
his
right
coat
pocket
,
he
*NL*
should
by
no
means
have
suffered
his
right
hand
to
have
got
engaged
:
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
instead
of
taking
off
his
wig
with
it
,
as
he
did
,
he
ought
*NL*
to
have
committed
that
entirely
to
the
left
;
and
then
,
when
the
natural
*NL*
exigency
my
father
was
under
of
rubbing
his
head
,
called
out
for
his
*NL*
handkerchief
,
he
would
have
had
nothing
in
the
world
to
have
done
,
*NL*
but
to
have
put
his
right
hand
into
his
right
coat
pocket
and
taken
*NL*
it
out
;
--
which
he
might
have
done
without
any
violence
,
or
the
least
*NL*
ungraceful
twist
in
any
one
tendon
or
muscle
of
his
whole
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
case
,
-LRB-
unless
,
indeed
,
my
father
had
been
resolved
to
make
a
*NL*
fool
of
himself
by
holding
the
wig
stiff
in
his
left
hand
--
or
by
making
*NL*
some
nonsensical
angle
or
other
at
his
elbow-joint
,
or
armpit
-RRB-
--
his
*NL*
whole
attitude
had
been
easy
--
natural
--
unforced
:
Reynolds
himself
,
as
*NL*
great
and
gracefully
as
he
paints
,
might
have
painted
him
as
he
sat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
as
my
father
managed
this
matter
,
--
consider
what
a
devil
of
a
figure
*NL*
my
father
made
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
latter
end
of
Queen
Anne
's
reign
,
and
in
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
reign
of
King
George
the
first
--
`
Coat
pockets
were
cut
very
low
down
*NL*
in
the
skirt
.
'
--
I
need
say
no
more
--
the
father
of
mischief
,
had
he
been
*NL*
hammering
at
it
a
month
,
could
not
have
contrived
a
worse
fashion
for
*NL*
one
in
my
father
's
situation
.

*NL*
It
was
not
an
easy
matter
in
any
king
's
reign
-LRB-
unless
you
were
as
lean
*NL*
a
subject
as
myself
-RRB-
to
have
forced
your
hand
diagonally
,
quite
*NL*
across
your
whole
body
,
so
as
to
gain
the
bottom
of
your
opposite
coat
*NL*
pocket
.

In
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
eighteen
,
when
*NL*
this
happened
,
it
was
extremely
difficult
;
so
that
when
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
discovered
the
transverse
zig-zaggery
of
my
father
's
approaches
towards
*NL*
it
,
it
instantly
brought
into
his
mind
those
he
had
done
duty
in
,
before
*NL*
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
;
--
the
idea
of
which
drew
off
his
attention
so
*NL*
intirely
from
the
subject
in
debate
,
that
he
had
got
his
right
hand
*NL*
to
the
bell
to
ring
up
Trim
to
go
and
fetch
his
map
of
Namur
,
and
his
*NL*
compasses
and
sector
along
with
it
,
to
measure
the
returning
angles
of
*NL*
the
traverses
of
that
attack
,
--
but
particularly
of
that
one
,
where
he
*NL*
received
his
wound
upon
his
groin
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
knit
his
brows
,
and
as
he
knit
them
,
all
the
blood
in
his
body
*NL*
seemed
to
rush
up
into
his
face
--
my
uncle
Toby
dismounted
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*

I
did
not
apprehend
your
uncle
Toby
was
o'horseback

A
man
's
body

his
mind
,
with
the
utmost
reverence
to
both
I
speak
it

are
exactly
like
a
jerkin
,
and
a
jerkin
's
lining
;
--
rumple
the
one
,
--
you
*NL*
rumple
the
other
.
There
is
one
certain
exception
however
in
this
case
,
*NL*
and
that
is
,
when
you
are
so
fortunate
a
fellow
,
as
to
have
had
your
*NL*
jerkin
made
of
gum-taffeta

unthinking
Shandean
people
as
ever
lived

whose
names
I
ca
n't
*NL*
recollect
,
--
all
pretended
that
their
jerkins
were
made
after
this
*NL*
fashion
,

you
might
have
rumpled
and
crumpled
,
and
doubled
and
creased
,
*NL*
and
fretted
and
fridged
the
outside
of
them
all
to
pieces
;

in
short
,
*NL*
you
might
have
played
the
very
devil
with
them
,

at
the

time
,
*NL*
not

insides

would
have
been

the
worse

for
*NL*
all
you
had
done
to
them

*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
in
my
conscience
that
mine
is
made
up
somewhat
after
this
*NL*
sort
:
--
for
never
poor
jerkin
has
been
tickled
off
at
such
a
rate
as
it
*NL*
has
been
these
last
nine
months
together
,

and
yet
I
declare
,
the
lining
*NL*
to
it
,
--
as
far
as
I
am
a
judge
of
the
matter
,
--
is
not
a
three-penny
*NL*
piece
the
worse
;
--
pell-mell
,
helter-skelter
,
ding-dong
,
cut
and
thrust
,
*NL*
back
stroke
and
fore
stroke
,
side
way
and
long-way
,
have
they
*NL*
been
trimming
it
for
me
:
--
had
there
been
the
least
gumminess
in
my
*NL*
lining
,
--
by
heaven
!
it
had
all
of
it
long
ago
been
frayed
and
fretted
to
*NL*
a
thread
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
Messrs.
the
Monthly
Reviewers
!
--
how
could
you
cut
and
slash
my
*NL*
jerkin
as
you
did
?

how
did
you
know

you
would
cut
my
lining
too
?

Heartily

from
my
soul

to
the
protection
of
that
Being
who
will

injure
none

do
I
recommend
you

,

so
God
bless
*NL*
you

only
next
month
,
if
any
one
of
you
should
gnash
his
teeth
,
and
*NL*
storm
and
rage
at
me
,
as
some
of
you
did
last
May
-LRB-
in
which
I
remember
*NL*
the
weather
was
very
hot
-RRB-

do
n't
be
exasperated

I
pass
it
by
again

good
temper

I
live

in

means
the

-RRB-
never
to
give

a

word

than
my

Any

Madam

reasoning
upwards
,
and
observing
the
prodigious
*NL*
suffusion
of
blood
in
my
father
's
countenance
,
--
by
means
of
which
-LRB-
as
*NL*
all
the
blood
in
his
body
seemed
to
rush
into
his
face

as
I
told
you
-RRB-
*NL*
he
must
have
reddened
,
pictorically
and
scientifically
speaking
,
*NL*
six
whole
tints
and
a
half
,
if
not
a
full
octave
above
his
natural
*NL*
colour
:

any
man

my
uncle
Toby
,
who
had
observed
this
,
*NL*
together
with
the
violent
knitting
of
my
father
's
brows
,
and
the
*NL*
extravagant
contortion
of
his
body
during
the
whole
affair
,
--
would
have
*NL*
concluded
my
father
in
a
rage
;
and
taking
that
for
granted
,
--
had
he
*NL*
been
a
lover
of
such
kind
of
concord
as
arises
from
two
such
instruments
*NL*
being
put
in
exact
tune
,
--
he
would
instantly
have
skrew
'd
up
his
,
to
*NL*
the
same
pitch
;
--
and
then
the
devil
and
all
had
broke
loose

the
*NL*
whole
piece
,
Madam

must
have
been
played
off

or
any

hurly
burly
whatever

Any

I
say

Madam

my

Toby

the
benignity
of

heart
*NL*
interpreted
every
motion

body
in

kindest
sense
the
motion
*NL*
would
admit
of
,
would
have
concluded
my

angry
,
and
blamed
*NL*
him
too
.
My
uncle
Toby
blamed
nothing
but
the
taylor
who
cut
the
*NL*
pocket-hole
;

so
sitting
still
till
my
father
had
got
his
handkerchief
*NL*
out
of
it
,
and
looking
all
the
time
up
in
his
face
with
inexpressible

good-will

went

Brother
Toby

quoth
my

I
do
believe
thee
to
be
as
honest
a
*NL*
man
,
and
with
as
good
and
as
upright
a
heart
as
ever
God
created
;

nor
*NL*
is
it
thy
fault
,
if
all
the
children
which
have
been

may
,
can
,
shall
,
*NL*
will
,
or
ought
to
be
begotten
,
come
with
their
heads
foremost
into
*NL*
the
world
:

but
believe
me
,
dear
Toby
,
the
accidents
which
unavoidably
*NL*
way-lay
them
,
not
only
in
the
article
of
our
begetting
'em
--
though
*NL*
these
,
in
my
opinion
,
are
well
worth
considering
,
--
but
the
dangers
and
*NL*
difficulties
our
children
are
beset
with
,
after
they
are
got
forth
into
*NL*
the
world
,
are
enow
--
little
need
is
there
to
expose
them
to
unnecessary
*NL*
ones
in
their
passage
to
it
.
--
Are
these
dangers
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
laying
his
hand
upon
my
father
's
knee
,
and
looking
up
seriously
in
his
*NL*
face
for
an
answer
,
--
are
these
dangers
greater
now
o'days
,
brother
,
*NL*
than
in
times
past
?
Brother
Toby
,
answered
my
father
,
if
a
child
was
but
*NL*
fairly
begot
,
and
born
alive
,
and
healthy
,
and
the
mother
did
well
after

it

never
looked
farther

My
uncle
Toby
instantly
*NL*
withdrew
his
hand
from
off
my
father
's
knee

reclined
his
body
gently
*NL*
back
in
his
chair

raised
his
head
till
he
could
just
see
the
cornice
of
*NL*
the

and
then
directing
the
buccinatory
muscles
along
his
cheeks
,
*NL*
and
the
orbicular
muscles
around
his
lips
to
do
their
duty

whistled

Whilst
my
uncle
Toby
was
whistling
Lillabullero
to
my
father
,
--
Dr.
Slop
*NL*
was
stamping
,
and
cursing
and
damning
at
Obadiah
at
a
most
dreadful
*NL*
rate
,
--
it
would
have
done
your
heart
good
,
and
cured
you
,
Sir
,
for
*NL*
ever
of
the
vile
sin
of
swearing
,
to
have
heard
him
,
I
am
determined
*NL*
therefore
to
relate
the
whole
affair
to
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Dr.
Slop
's
maid
delivered
the
green
baize
bag
with
her
master
's
*NL*
instruments
in
it
,
to
Obadiah
,
she
very
sensibly
exhorted
him
to
put
his
*NL*
head
and
one
arm
through
the
strings
,
and
ride
with
it
slung
across
his
*NL*
body
:
so
undoing
the
bow-knot
,
to
lengthen
the
strings
for
him
,
without
*NL*
any
more
ado
,
she
helped
him
on
with
it
.
However
,
as
this
,
in
some
*NL*
measure
,
unguarded
the
mouth
of
the
bag
,
lest
any
thing
should
bolt
out
*NL*
in
galloping
back
,
at
the
speed
Obadiah
threatened
,
they
consulted
to
*NL*
take
it
off
again
:
and
in
the
great
care
and
caution
of
their
hearts
,
*NL*
they
had
taken
the
two
strings
and
tied
them
close
-LRB-
pursing
up
the
mouth
*NL*
of
the
bag
first
-RRB-
with
half
a
dozen
hard
knots
,
each
of
which
Obadiah
,
*NL*
to
make
all
safe
,
had
twitched
and
drawn
together
with
all
the
strength
*NL*
of
his
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
answered
all
that
Obadiah
and
the
maid
intended
;
but
was
no
remedy
*NL*
against
some
evils
which
neither
he
or
she
foresaw
.
The
instruments
,
it
*NL*
seems
,
as
tight
as
the
bag
was
tied
above
,
had
so
much
room
to
play
in
*NL*
it
,
towards
the
bottom
-LRB-
the
shape
of
the
bag
being
conical
-RRB-
that
Obadiah
*NL*
could
not
make
a
trot
of
it
,
but
with
such
a
terrible
jingle
,
what
with
*NL*
the
tire

and

,
as
would
have
been
enough
,
had
Hymen
*NL*
been
taking
a
jaunt
that
way
,
to
have
frightened
him
out
of
the
country
;
*NL*
but
when
Obadiah
accelerated
his
motion
,
and
from
a
plain
trot
assayed
*NL*
to
prick
his
coach-horse
into
a
full
gallop
--
by
Heaven
!
Sir
,
the
jingle
*NL*
was
incredible
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Obadiah
had
a
wife
and
three
children
--
the
turpitude
of
fornication
,
*NL*
and
the
many
other
political
ill
consequences
of
this
jingling
,
never
*NL*
once
entered
his
brain
,
--
he
had
however
his
objection
,
which
came
home
*NL*
to
himself
,
and
weighed
with
him
,
as
it
has
oft-times
done
with
the
*NL*
greatest
patriots
.

As
Obadiah
loved
wind-music
preferably
to
all
the
instrumental
music
he
*NL*
carried
with
him
,
--
he
very
considerately
set
his
imagination
to
work
,
*NL*
to
contrive
and
to
invent
by
what
means
he
should
put
himself
in
a
*NL*
condition
of
enjoying
it
.

In
all
distresses
-LRB-
except
musical
-RRB-
where
small
cords
are
wanted
,
nothing
*NL*
is
so
apt
to
enter
a
man
's
head
as
his
hat-band
:
--
the
philosophy
of
this
*NL*
is
so
near
the
surface
--
I
scorn
to
enter
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Obadiah
's
was
a
mixed
case
--
mark
,
Sirs
,
--
I
say
,
a
mixed
case
;
for
it
*NL*
was
obstetrical
,
--
scrip-tical
,
squirtical
,
papistical
--
and
as
far
as
*NL*
the
coach-horse
was
concerned
in
it
,
--
caballistical
--
and
only
partly
*NL*
musical
;
--
Obadiah
made
no
scruple
of
availing
himself
of
the
first
*NL*
expedient
which
offered
;
so
taking
hold
of
the
bag
and
instruments
,
and
*NL*
griping
them
hard
together
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
finger
and
thumb
*NL*
of
the
other
putting
the
end
of
the
hat-band
betwixt
his
teeth
,
and
then
*NL*
slipping
his
hand
down
to
the
middle
of
it
,
--
he
tied
and
cross-tied
them
*NL*
all
fast
together
from
one
end
to
the
other
-LRB-
as
you
would
cord
a
trunk
-RRB-
*NL*
with
such
a
multiplicity
of
round-abouts
and
intricate
cross
turns
,
with
*NL*
a
hard
knot
at
every
intersection
or
point
where
the
strings
met
,
--
that
*NL*
Dr.
Slop
must
have
had
three
fifths
of
Job
's
patience
at
least
to
have
*NL*
unloosed
them
.
--
I
think
in
my
conscience
,
that
had
Nature
been
in
one
of
*NL*
her
nimble
moods
,
and
in
humour
for
such
a
contest
--
and
she
and
Dr.
Slop
*NL*
both
fairly
started
together
--
there
is
no
man
living
which
had
seen
the
*NL*
bag
with
all
that
Obadiah
had
done
to
it
,
--
and
known
likewise
the
great
*NL*
speed
the
Goddess
can
make
when
she
thinks
proper
,
who
would
have
had
*NL*
the
least
doubt
remaining
in
his
mind
--
which
of
the
two
would
have
*NL*
carried
off
the
prize
.
My
mother
,
Madam
,
had
been
delivered
sooner
than

the
green
bag
infallibly

it

thy

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Great
wits
jump
:
for
the
moment
Dr.
Slop
cast
his
eyes
upon
his
bag
*NL*
-LRB-
which
he
had
not
done
till
the
dispute
with
my
uncle
Toby
about
*NL*
mid-wifery
put
him
in
mind
of
it
-RRB-
--
the
very
same
thought
occurred
.
--
'T
is
*NL*
God
's
mercy
,
quoth
he
-LRB-
to
himself
-RRB-
that
Mrs.
Shandy
has
had
so
bad
a
*NL*
time
of
it
,
--
else
she
might
have
been
brought
to
bed
seven
times
told
,
*NL*
before
one
half
of
these
knots
could
have
got
untied
.
--
But
here
you
must
*NL*
distinguish
--
the
thought
floated
only
in
Dr.
Slop
's
mind
,
without
sail
*NL*
or
ballast
to
it
,
as
a
simple
proposition
;
millions
of
which
,
as
your
*NL*
worship
knows
,
are
every
day
swimming
quietly
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
thin
juice
of
a
man
's
understanding
,
without
being
carried
backwards
or
*NL*
forwards
,
till
some
little
gusts
of
passion
or
interest
drive
them
to
*NL*
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
trampling
in
the
room
above
,
near
my
mother
's
bed
,
did
*NL*
the
proposition
the
very
service
I
am
speaking
of
.
By
all
that
's
*NL*
unfortunate
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
unless
I
make
haste
,
the
thing
will
*NL*
actually
befall
me
as
it
is
.

*NL*
In
the
case
of
knots
,
--
by
which
,
in
the
first
place
,
I
would
not
be
*NL*
understood
to
mean
slip-knots
--
because
in
the
course
of
my
life
and
*NL*
opinions
--
my
opinions
concerning
them
will
come
in
more
properly
when
I
*NL*
mention
the
catastrophe
of
my
great
uncle
Mr.
Hammond
Shandy
,
--
a
*NL*
little
man
,
--
but
of
high
fancy
:
--
he
rushed
into
the
duke
of
Monmouth
's
*NL*
affair
:
--
nor
,
secondly
,
in
this
place
,
do
I
mean
that
particular
species
*NL*
of
knots
called
bow-knots
;
--
there
is
so
little
address
,
or
skill
,
or
*NL*
patience
required
in
the
unloosing
them
,
that
they
are
below
my
giving
*NL*
any
opinion
at
all
about
them
.
--
But
by
the
knots
I
am
speaking
of
,
may
*NL*
it
please
your
reverences
to
believe
,
that
I
mean
good
,
honest
,
devilish
*NL*
tight
,
hard
knots
,
made
bona
fide
,
as
Obadiah
made
his
;
--
in
which
there
*NL*
is
no
quibbling
provision
made
by
the
duplication
and
return
of
the
*NL*
two
ends
of
the
strings
thro
'
the
annulus
or
noose
made
by
the
second
*NL*
implication
of
them
--
to
get
them
slipp
'd
and
undone
by
.
--
I
hope
you
*NL*
apprehend
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
case
of
these
knots
then
,
and
of
the
several
obstructions
,
which
,
*NL*
may
it
please
your
reverences
,
such
knots
cast
in
our
way
in
getting
*NL*
through
life
--
every
hasty
man
can
whip
out
his
pen-knife
and
cut
through
*NL*
them
.
--
'T
is
wrong
.
Believe
me
,
Sirs
,
the
most
virtuous
way
,
and
which
*NL*
both
reason
and
conscience
dictate
--
is
to
take
our
teeth
or
our
fingers
*NL*
to
them
.
--
Dr.
Slop
had
lost
his
teeth
--
his
favourite
instrument
,
by
*NL*
extracting
in
a
wrong
direction
,
or
by
some
misapplication
of
it
,
*NL*
unfortunately
slipping
,
he
had
formerly
,
in
a
hard
labour
,
knock
'd
*NL*
out
three
of
the
best
of
them
with
the
handle
of
it
:
--
he
tried
his
*NL*
fingers
--
alas
;
the
nails
of
his
fingers
and
thumbs
were
cut
close
.
--
The
*NL*
duce
take
it
!
I
can
make
nothing
of
it
either
way
,
cried
Dr.
Slop
.
--
The
*NL*
trampling
over
head
near
my
mother
's
bed-side
increased
.
--
Pox
take
the
*NL*
fellow
!
I
shall
never
get
the
knots
untied
as
long
as
I
live
.
--
My
mother
*NL*
gave
a
groan
.
--
Lend
me
your
penknife
--
I
must
e
`
en
cut
the
knots
at
*NL*
last
--
pugh
!
--
psha
!
--
Lord
!
I
have
cut
my
thumb
quite
across
to
the
very
*NL*
bone
--
curse
the
fellow
--
if
there
was
not
another
man-midwife
within
*NL*
fifty
miles
--
I
am
undone
for
this
bout
--
I
wish
the
scoundrel
hang
'd
--
I
*NL*
wish
he
was
shot
--
I
wish
all
the
devils
in
hell
had
him
for
a
*NL*
blockhead
--
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
had
a
great
respect
for
Obadiah
,
and
could
not
bear
to
hear
*NL*
him
disposed
of
in
such
a
manner
--
he
had
moreover
some
little
respect
*NL*
for
himself
--
and
could
as
ill
bear
with
the
indignity
offered
to
himself
*NL*
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Dr.
Slop
cut
any
part
about
him
,
but
his
thumb
--
my
father
had
pass
'd
*NL*
it
by
--
his
prudence
had
triumphed
:
as
it
was
,
he
was
determined
to
have
*NL*
his
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Small
curses
,
Dr.
Slop
,
upon
great
occasions
,
quoth
my
father
-LRB-
condoling
*NL*
with
him
first
upon
the
accident
-RRB-
are
but
so
much
waste
of
our
strength
*NL*
and
soul
's
health
to
no
manner
of
purpose
.
--
I
own
it
,
replied
Dr.
*NL*
Slop
.
--
They
are
like
sparrow-shot
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
-LRB-
suspending
his
*NL*
whistling
-RRB-
fired
against
a
bastion
.
--
They
serve
,
continued
my
father
,
*NL*
to
stir
the
humours
--
but
carry
off
none
of
their
acrimony
:
--
for
my
own
*NL*
part
,
I
seldom
swear
or
curse
at
all
--
I
hold
it
bad
--
but
if
I
fall
into
*NL*
it
by
surprize
,
I
generally
retain
so
much
presence
of
mind
-LRB-
right
,
*NL*
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
-RRB-
as
to
make
it
answer
my
purpose
--
that
is
,
I
swear
*NL*
on
till
I
find
myself
easy
.
A
wife
and
a
just
man
however
would
always
*NL*
endeavour
to
proportion
the
vent
given
to
these
humours
,
not
only
to
the
*NL*
degree
of
them
stirring
within
himself
--
but
to
the
size
and
ill
intent
*NL*
of
the
offence
upon
which
they
are
to
fall
.
--
`
Injuries
come
only
from
*NL*
the
heart
,
'
--
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
For
this
reason
,
continued
my
father
,
*NL*
with
the
most
Cervantick
gravity
,
I
have
the
greatest
veneration
in
the
*NL*
world
for
that
gentleman
,
who
,
in
distrust
of
his
own
discretion
in
*NL*
this
point
,
sat
down
and
composed
-LRB-
that
is
at
his
leisure
-RRB-
fit
forms
*NL*
of
swearing
suitable
to
all
cases
,
from
the
lowest
to
the
highest
*NL*
provocation
which
could
possibly
happen
to
him
--
which
forms
being
well
*NL*
considered
by
him
,
and
such
moreover
as
he
could
stand
to
,
he
kept
them
*NL*
ever
by
him
on
the
chimney-piece
,
within
his
reach
,
ready
for
use
.
--
I
*NL*
never
apprehended
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
that
such
a
thing
was
ever
thought
*NL*
of
--
much
less
executed
.
I
beg
your
pardon
,
answered
my
father
;
I
was
*NL*
reading
,
though
not
using
,
one
of
them
to
my
brother
Toby
this
*NL*
morning
,
whilst
he
pour
'd
out
the
tea
--
't
is
here
upon
the
shelf
over
*NL*
my
head
;
--
but
if
I
remember
right
,
't
is
too
violent
for
a
cut
of
the
*NL*
thumb
.
--
Not
at
all
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
--
the
devil
take
the
fellow
.
--
Then
,
*NL*
answered
my
father
,
'T
is
much
at
your
service
,
Dr.
Slop
--
on
condition
*NL*
you
will
read
it
aloud
;
--
so
rising
up
and
reaching
down
a
form
of
*NL*
excommunication
of
the
church
of
Rome
,
a
copy
of
which
,
my
father
-LRB-
who
*NL*
was
curious
in
his
collections
-RRB-
had
procured
out
of
the
leger-book
*NL*
of
the
church
of
Rochester
,
writ
by
Ernulphus
the
bishop
--
with
a
*NL*
most
affected
seriousness
of
look
and
voice
,
which
might
have
cajoled
*NL*
Ernulphus
himself
--
he
put
it
into
Dr.
Slop
's
hands
.
--
Dr.
Slop
wrapt
his
*NL*
thumb
up
in
the
corner
of
his
handkerchief
,
and
with
a
wry
face
,
though
*NL*
without
any
suspicion
,
read
aloud
,
as
follows
--
my
uncle
Toby
whistling
*NL*
Lillabullero
as
loud
as
he
could
all
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
As
the
geniuneness
of
the
consultation
of
the
Sorbonne
upon
the
*NL*
question
of
baptism
,
was
doubted
by
some
,
and
denied
by
others
--
't
was
*NL*
thought
proper
to
print
the
original
of
this
excommunication
;
for
the
*NL*
copy
of
which
Mr.
Shandy
returns

'
I
think
there
is
no
necessity
,
quoth
Dr.
*NL*
Slop
,
dropping
the
paper
down
to
his
knee
,
and
addressing
himself
to
my
*NL*
father
--
as
you
have
read
it
over
,
Sir
,
so
lately
,
to
read
it
aloud
--
and
*NL*
as
Captain
Shandy
seems
to
have
no
great
inclination
to
hear
it
--
I
*NL*
may
as
well
read
it
to
myself
.
That
's
contrary
to
treaty
,
replied
my
*NL*
father
:
--
besides
,
there
is
something
so
whimsical
,
especially
in
the
*NL*
latter
part
of
it
,
I
should
grieve
to
lose
the
pleasure
of
a
second
*NL*
reading
.
Dr.
Slop
did
not
altogether
like
it
,
--
but
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
offering
at
that
instant
to
give
over
whistling
,
and
read
it
himself
to
*NL*
them
;
--
Dr.
Slop
thought
he
might
as
well
read
it
under
the
cover
of
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
whistling
--
as
suffer
my
uncle
Toby
to
read
it
alone
;
--
so
*NL*
raising
up
the
paper
to
his
face
,
and
holding
it
quite
parallel
to
it
,
*NL*
in
order
to
hide
his
chagrin
--
he
read
it
aloud
as
follows

my
uncle
Toby

not

loud

Now
do
n't
let
us
give
ourselves
a
parcel
of
airs
,
and
pretend
that
the
*NL*
oaths
we
make
free
with
in
this
land
of
liberty
of
ours
are
our
own
;
and
*NL*
because
we
have
the
spirit
to
swear
them
,
--
imagine
that
we
have
had
the
*NL*
wit
to
invent
them
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
'll
undertake
this
moment
to
prove
it
to
any
man
in
the
world
,
except
*NL*
to
a
connoisseur
:
--
though
I
declare
I
object
only
to
a
connoisseur
in
*NL*
swearing
,
--
as
I
would
do
to
a
connoisseur
in
painting
,
&
c.
&
c.
the
whole
*NL*
set
of
'em
are
so
hung
round
and
befetish
'd
with
the
bobs
and
trinkets
*NL*
of
criticism
,
--
or
to
drop
my
metaphor
,
which
by
the
bye
is
a
pity
--
for
*NL*
I
have
fetch
'd
it
as
far
as
from
the
coast
of
Guiney
;
--
their
heads
,
*NL*
Sir
,
are
stuck
so
full
of
rules
and
compasses
,
and
have
that
eternal
*NL*
propensity
to
apply
them
upon
all
occasions
,
that
a
work
of
genius
had
*NL*
better
go
to
the
devil
at
once
,
than
stand
to
be
prick
'd
and
tortured
to
*NL*
death
by
'em
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
how
did
Garrick
speak
the
soliloquy
last
night
?
--
Oh
,
against
all
*NL*
rule
,
my
lord
,
--
most
ungrammatically
!
betwixt
the
substantive
and
the
*NL*
adjective
,
which
should
agree
together
in
number
,
case
,
and
gender
,
he
*NL*
made
a
breach
thus
,
--
stopping
,
as
if
the
point
wanted
settling
;
--
and
*NL*
betwixt
the
nominative
case
,
which
your
lordship
knows
should
govern
the
*NL*
verb
,
he
suspended
his
voice
in
the
epilogue
a
dozen
times
three
*NL*
seconds
and
three
fifths
by
a
stop
watch
,
my
lord
,
each
time
.
--
Admirable
*NL*
grammarian
!
--
But
in
suspending
his
voice
--
was
the
sense
suspended
*NL*
likewise
?
Did
no
expression
of
attitude
or
countenance
fill
up
the
*NL*
chasm
?
--
Was
the
eye
silent
?
Did
you
narrowly
look
?
--
I
look
'd
only
at
the
*NL*
stop-watch
,
my
lord
.
--
Excellent
observer
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
of
this
new
book
the
whole
world
makes
such
a
rout
about
?
--
Oh
!
*NL*
't
is
out
of
all
plumb
,
my
lord
,
--
quite
an
irregular
thing
!
--
not
one
of
*NL*
the
angles
at
the
four
corners
was
a
right
angle
.
--
I
had
my
rule
and
*NL*
compasses
,
&
c.
my
lord
,
in
my
pocket
.
--
Excellent
critick
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
for
the
epick
poem
your
lordship
bid
me
look
at
--
upon
taking
the
*NL*
length
,
breadth
,
height
,
and
depth
of
it
,
and
trying
them
at
home
*NL*
upon
an
exact
scale
of
Bossu
's
--
't
is
out
,
my
lord
,
in
every
one
of
its
*NL*
dimensions
.
--
Admirable
connoisseur
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
did
you
step
in
,
to
take
a
look
at
the
grand
picture
in
your
way
*NL*
back
?
--
'T
is
a
melancholy
daub
!
my
lord
;
not
one
principle
of
the
pyramid
*NL*
in
any
one
group
!
--
and
what
a
price
!
--
for
there
is
nothing
of
the
*NL*
colouring
of
Titian
--
the
expression
of
Rubens
--
the
grace
of
Raphael
--
the
*NL*
purity
of
Dominichino
--
the
corregiescity
of
Corregio
--
the
learning
of
*NL*
Poussin
--
the
airs
of
Guido
--
the
taste
of
the
Carrachis
--
or
the
grand
*NL*
contour
of
Angelo
.
--
Grant
me
patience
,
just
Heaven
!
--
Of
all
the
cants
*NL*
which
are
canted
in
this
canting
world
--
though
the
cant
of
hypocrites
*NL*
may
be
the
worst
--
the
cant
of
criticism
is
the
most
tormenting
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
go
fifty
miles
on
foot
,
for
I
have
not
a
horse
worth
riding
on
,
*NL*
to
kiss
the
hand
of
that
man
whose
generous
heart
will
give
up
the
reins
*NL*
of
his
imagination
into
his
author
's
hands
--
be
pleased
he
knows
not
why
,
*NL*
and
cares
not
wherefore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
Apollo
!
if
thou
art
in
a
giving
humour
--
give
me
--
I
ask
no
more
,
*NL*
but
one
stroke
of
native
humour
,
with
a
single
spark
of
thy
own
fire
*NL*
along
with
it
--
and
send
Mercury
,
with
the
rules
and
compasses
,
if
he
can
*NL*
be
spared
,
with
my
compliments
to
--
no
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
to
any
one
else
I
will
undertake
to
prove
,
that
all
the
oaths
and
*NL*
imprecations
which
we
have
been
puffing
off
upon
the
world
for
these
*NL*
two
hundred
and
fifty
years
last
past
as
originals
--
except
St.
Paul
's
*NL*
thumb
--
God
's
flesh
and
God
's
fish
,
which
were
oaths
monarchical
,
and
,
*NL*
considering
who
made
them
,
not
much
amiss
;
and
as
kings
oaths
,
't
is
not
*NL*
much
matter
whether
they
were
fish
or
flesh
;
--
else
I
say
,
there
is
not
*NL*
an
oath
,
or
at
least
a
curse
amongst
them
,
which
has
not
been
copied
*NL*
over
and
over
again
out
of
Ernulphus
a
thousand
times
:
but
,
like
all
*NL*
other
copies
,
how
infinitely
short
of
the
force
and
spirit
of
the
*NL*
original
!
--
it
is
thought
to
be
no
bad
oath
--
and
by
itself
passes
very
*NL*
well
--
`
G-d
damn
you
.
'
--
Set
it
beside
Ernulphus
's
--
`
God
almighty
the
*NL*
Father
damn
you
--
God
the
Son
damn
you
--
God
the
Holy
Ghost
damn
you
'
--
you
*NL*
see
't
is
nothing
.
--
There
is
an
orientality
in
his
,
we
can
not
rise
up
*NL*
to
:
besides
,
he
is
more
copious
in
his
invention
--
possess
'd
more
of
the
*NL*
excellencies
of
a
swearer
--
had
such
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
human
*NL*
frame
,
its
membranes
,
nerves
,
ligaments
,
knittings
of
the
joints
,
and
*NL*
articulations
,
--
that
when
Ernulphus
cursed
--
no
part
escaped
him
.
--
'T
is
*NL*
true
there
is
something
of
a
hardness
in
his
manner
--
and
,
as
in
Michael
*NL*
Angelo
,
a
want
of
grace
--
but
then
there
is
such
a
greatness
of
gusto
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
who
generally
look
'd
upon
every
thing
in
a
light
very
*NL*
different
from
all
mankind
,
would
,
after
all
,
never
allow
this
to
be
an
*NL*
original
.
--
He
considered
rather
Ernulphus
's
anathema
,
as
an
institute
*NL*
of
swearing
,
in
which
,
as
he
suspected
,
upon
the
decline
of
swearing
in
*NL*
some
milder
pontificate
,
Ernulphus
,
by
order
of
the
succeeding
pope
,
*NL*
had
with
great
learning
and
diligence
collected
together
all
the
laws
of
*NL*
it
;
--
for
the
same
reason
that
Justinian
,
in
the
decline
of
the
empire
,
*NL*
had
ordered
his
chancellor
Tribonian
to
collect
the
Roman
or
civil
*NL*
laws
all
together
into
one
code
or
digest
--
lest
,
through
the
rust
of
*NL*
time
--
and
the
fatality
of
all
things
committed
to
oral
tradition
--
they
*NL*
should
be
lost
to
the
world
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
reason
my
father
would
oft-times
affirm
,
there
was
not
an
oath
*NL*
from
the
great
and
tremendous
oath
of
William
the
conqueror
-LRB-
By
the
*NL*
splendour
of
God
-RRB-
down
to
the
lowest
oath
of
a
scavenger
-LRB-
Damn
your
*NL*
eyes
-RRB-
which
was
not
to
be
found
in
Ernulphus
.
--
In
short
,
he
would
add
--
I
*NL*
defy
a
man
to
swear
out
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hypothesis
is
,
like
most
of
my
father
's
,
singular
and
ingenious
*NL*
too
;
--
nor
have
I
any
objection
to
it
,
but
that
it
overturns
my
own
.

Bless

I

cried
Dr.
Slop

-RRB-

the

child
is

Susannah

the

has
fallen
*NL*
backwards
upon
the
edge

bruised
her
hip
as
black
as
*NL*
your
hat
.

I
'll
look
at
it
,
quoth
Dr
Slop
.
--
There
is
no
need
of
that
,
*NL*
replied
Susannah
,
--
you
had
better
look
at
my
mistress
--
but
the
midwife
*NL*
would
gladly
first
give
you
an
account
how
things
are
,
so
desires
you
*NL*
would
go
up
stairs
and
speak
to
her
this
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Human
nature
is

professions

The
midwife
had
just
before
been
put
over
Dr.
Slop

head

He
had
not
*NL*
digested
it

No
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
`
twould
be
full
as
proper
if
*NL*
the
midwife
came
down
to
me
.
--
I
like
subordination
,
quoth
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
,
--
and
but
for
it
,
after
the
reduction
of
Lisle
,
I
know
not
what
*NL*
might
have
become
of
the
garrison
of
Ghent
,
in
the
mutiny
for
bread
,
*NL*
in
the

Ten

--
Nor
,
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
-LRB-
parodying
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
hobby-horsical
reflection
;
though
full
as
hobby-horsical
himself

do

Captain
Shandy

what
might
have
become
of

above

stairs
,
in
the
mutiny
and
confusion
I
find
all
things
are
in
at
present
,
*NL*
but
for
the
subordination
of
fingers
and
thumbs
to
...
--
the
application
*NL*
of
which
,
Sir

under
this
accident
of
mine
,
comes
in
so
a
propos

that
*NL*
without
it

the

upon

Let
us
go

to
the
...
--
in
the
last
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
singular
stroke
of
eloquence
-LRB-
at
least
it
was
so
,
when
eloquence
*NL*
flourished
at
Athens
and
Rome
,
and
would
be
so
now
,
did
orators
wear
*NL*
mantles
-RRB-
not
to
mention
the
name
of
a
thing
,
when
you
had
the
thing
*NL*
about
you
in
petto
,
ready
to
produce
,
pop
,
in
the
place
you
want
it
.
A
*NL*
scar
,
an
axe
,
a
sword
,
a
pink
'd
doublet
,
a
rusty
helmet
,
a
pound
and
a
*NL*
half
of
pot-ashes
in
an
urn
,
or
a
three-halfpenny
pickle
pot
--
but
above
*NL*
all
,
a
tender
infant
royally
accoutred
.
--
Tho
'
if
it
was
too
young
,
and
*NL*
the
oration
as
long
as
Tully
's
second
Philippick
--
it
must
certainly
have
*NL*
beshit
the
orator
's
mantle
.
--
And
then
again
,
if
too
old
,
--
it
must
have
*NL*
been
unwieldly
and
incommodious
to
his
action
--
so
as
to
make
him
lose
*NL*
by
his
child
almost
as
much
as
he
could
gain
by
it
.
--
Otherwise
,
when
a
*NL*
state
orator
has
hit
the
precise
age
to
a
minute
--
hid
his
Bambino
in
his
*NL*
mantle
so
cunningly
that
no
mortal
could
smell
it
--
and
produced
it
so
*NL*
critically
,
that
no
soul
could
say
,
it
came
in
by
head
and
shoulders
--
Oh
*NL*
Sirs
!
it
has
done
wonders
--
It
has
open
'd
the
sluices
,
and
turn
'd
the
*NL*
brains
,
and
shook
the
principles
,
and
unhinged
the
politicks
of
half
a
*NL*
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
feats
however
are
not
to
be
done
,
except
in
those
states
and
*NL*
times
,
I
say
,
where
orators
wore
mantles
--
and
pretty
large
ones
too
,
*NL*
my
brethren
,
with
some
twenty
or
five-and-twenty
yards
of
good
purple
,
*NL*
superfine
,
marketable
cloth
in
them
--
with
large
flowing
folds
and
*NL*
doubles
,
and
in
a
great
style
of
design
.
--
All
which
plainly
shews
,
may
*NL*
it
please
your
worships
,
that
the
decay
of
eloquence
,
and
the
little
*NL*
good
service
it
does
at
present
,
both
within
and
without
doors
,
is
*NL*
owing
to
nothing
else
in
the
world
,
but
short
coats
,
and
the
disuse
of
*NL*
trunk-hose
.

We
can
conceal
nothing
under
ours

Madam

worth
shewing

*NL*
Dr.
Slop
was
within
an
ace
of
being
an
exception
to
all
this
*NL*
argumentation
:
for
happening
to
have
his
green
baize
bag
upon
his
knees
,
*NL*
when
he
began
to
parody
my
uncle
Toby
--
't
was
as
good
as
the
best
mantle
*NL*
in
the
world
to
him
:
for
which
purpose
,
when
he
foresaw
the
sentence
*NL*
would
end
in
his
new-invented
forceps
,
he
thrust
his
hand
into
the
bag
*NL*
in
order
to
have
them
ready
to
clap
in
,
when
your
reverences
took
so
*NL*
much
notice
of
the
...
,
which
had
he
managed
--
my
uncle
Toby
had
certainly
*NL*
been
overthrown
:
the
sentence
and
the
argument
in
that
case
jumping
*NL*
closely
in
one
point
,
so
like
the
two
lines
which
form
the
salient
angle
*NL*
of
a
ravelin
,
--
Dr.
Slop
would
never
have
given
them
up
;
--
and
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
flying
,
as
taking
them
by
force
:
but
*NL*
Dr.
Slop
fumbled
so
vilely
in
pulling
them
out
,
it
took
off
the
whole
*NL*
effect
,
and
what
was
a
ten
times
worse
evil
-LRB-
for
they
seldom
come
alone
*NL*
in
this
life
-RRB-
in
pulling
out
his
forceps
,
his
forceps
unfortunately
drew
*NL*
out
the
squirt
along
with
it
.

When
a

't

the

may
reply
to
which
of

he

pleases
,

finds
most
convenient

This
threw
the
advantage
of
*NL*
the
argument
quite
on
my
uncle
Toby
's
side
.

`
Good

*NL*
*NL*
--
Upon
my
honour
,
Sir
,
you
have
tore
every
bit
of
skin
quite
off
the
*NL*
back
of
both
my
hands
with
your
forceps
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
--
and
you
*NL*
have
crush
'd
all
my
knuckles
into
the
bargain
with
them
to
a
jelly
.
'T
is
*NL*
your
own
fault
,
said
Dr.
Slop
--
you
should
have
clinch
'd
your
two
fists
*NL*
together
into
the
form
of
a
child
's
head
as
I
told
you
,
and
sat
firm
.
--
I
*NL*
did
so
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
Then
the
points
of
my
forceps
have
not
*NL*
been
sufficiently
arm
'd
,
or
the
rivet
wants
closing
--
or
else
the
cut
on
*NL*
my
thumb
has
made
me
a
little
aukward
--
or
possibly
--
'T
is
well
,
quoth
my
*NL*
father
,
interrupting
the
detail
of
possibilities
--
that
the
experiment
*NL*
was
not
first
made
upon
my
child
's
head-piece
.
--
It
would
not
have
been
a
*NL*
cherry-stone
the
worse
,
answered
Dr.
Slop
.
--
I
maintain
it
,
said
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
,
it
would
have
broke
the
cerebellum
-LRB-
unless
indeed
the
skull
*NL*
had
been
as
hard
as
a
granado
-RRB-
and
turn
'd
it
all
into
a
perfect
*NL*
posset
.
--
Pshaw
!
replied
Dr.
Slop
,
a
child
's
head
is
naturally
as
soft
*NL*
as
the
pap
of
an
apple
;
--
the
sutures
give
way
--
and
besides
,
I
could
*NL*
have
extracted
by
the
feet
after
.
--
Not
you
,
said
she
.
--
I
rather
wish
you
*NL*
would
begin
that
way
,
quoth
my
father

And
pray
,
good

,
after
all
,
will
you
take
upon
you
to
say
,
it
*NL*
may
not
be
the
child
's
hip
,
as
well
as
the
child
's
head
?
--
'T
is
most
*NL*
certainly
the
head
,
replied
the
midwife
.
Because
,
continued
Dr.
Slop
*NL*
-LRB-
turning
to
my
father
-RRB-
as
positive
as
these
old
ladies
generally
*NL*
are
--
't
is
a
point
very
difficult
to
know
--
and
yet
of
the
greatest
*NL*
consequence
to
be
known
;
--
because
,
Sir
,
if
the
hip
is
mistaken
for
the
*NL*
head
--
there
is
a
possibility
-LRB-
if
it
is
a
boy
-RRB-
that
the
forceps
...
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
the
possibility
was
,
Dr.
Slop
whispered
very
low
to
my
father
,
*NL*
and
then
to
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
There
is
no
such
danger
,
continued
he
,
with
*NL*
the
head
.
--
No
,
in
truth
quoth
my
father
--
but
when
your
possibility
has
*NL*
taken
place
at
the
hip
--
you
may
as
well
take
off
the
head
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
morally
impossible
the
reader
should
understand
this
--
't
is
*NL*
enough
Dr.
Slop
understood
it
;
--
so
taking
the
green
baize
bag
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
with
the
help
of
Obadiah
's

,
he
tripp
'd
pretty
nimbly

for
*NL*
a
man
of

,
across
the

from

was

cried
my

,
looking

at
his

,
since
Dr.
Slop
and
Obadiah
arrived
--
and
I
know
not
how
it

happens
,
Brother
Toby
--
but
to
my
imagination
it
seems
almost
an

*NL*
*NL*

Here

pray

Sir

take
hold

it

Now
,
Sir

they
are
all
at
your
service
;
and
I
freely
make
you
a
present
*NL*
of
'em
,
on
condition
you
give
me
all
your
attention
to
this
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
my
father
said
,
`
he
knew
not
how
it
happen
'd
,
'
--
yet
he
knew
*NL*
very
well
how
it
happen
'd
;
--
and
at
the
instant
he
spoke
it
,
was
*NL*
pre-determined
in
his
mind
to
give
my
uncle
Toby
a
clear
account
of
the
*NL*
matter
by
a
metaphysical
dissertation
upon
the
subject
of
duration
and
*NL*
its
simple
modes
,
in
order
to
shew
my
uncle
Toby
by
what
mechanism
and
*NL*
mensurations
in
the
brain
it
came
to
pass
,
that
the
rapid
succession
of
*NL*
their
ideas
,
and
the
eternal
scampering
of
the
discourse
from
one
thing
*NL*
to
another
,
since
Dr.
Slop
had
come
into
the
room
,
had
lengthened
out
*NL*
so
short
a
period
to
so
inconceivable
an
extent
.
--
'
I
know
not
how
it
*NL*
happens
--
cried
my
father
,
--
but
it
seems
an
age
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
owing
entirely
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
the
succession
of
our
*NL*
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
who
had
an
itch
,
in
common
with
all
philosophers
,
of
*NL*
reasoning
upon
every
thing
which
happened
,
and
accounting
for
it
*NL*
too
--
proposed
infinite
pleasure
to
himself
in
this
,
of
the
succession
of
*NL*
ideas
,
and
had
not
the
least
apprehension
of
having
it
snatch
'd
out
of
*NL*
his
hands
by
my
uncle
Toby
,
who
-LRB-
honest
man
!
-RRB-
generally
took
every
thing
*NL*
as
it
happened
;
--
and
who
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
,
troubled
his
brain
*NL*
the
least
with
abstruse
thinking
;
--
the
ideas
of
time
and
space
--
or
how
*NL*
we
came
by
those
ideas
--
or
of
what
stuff
they
were
made
--
or
whether
they
*NL*
were
born
with
us
--
or
we
picked
them
up
afterwards
as
we
went
along
--
or
*NL*
whether
we
did
it
in
frocks
--
or
not
till
we
had
got
into
breeches
--
with
*NL*
a
thousand
other
inquiries
and
disputes
about
Infinity
Prescience
,
*NL*
Liberty
,
Necessity
,
and
so
forth
,
upon
whose
desperate
and
unconquerable
*NL*
theories
so
many
fine
heads
have
been
turned
and
cracked
--
never
did
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
the
least
injury
at
all
;
my
father
knew
it
--
and
was
no
less
*NL*
surprized
than
he
was
disappointed
,
with
my
uncle
's
fortuitous
solution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
you
understand
the
theory
of
that
affair
?
replied
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
I
,
quoth
my
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
you
have
some
ideas
,
said
my
father
,
of
what
you
talk
about
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
more
than
my
horse
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gracious

!
cried
my
father
,
looking
upwards
,
and
clasping
his
*NL*
two
hands
together
--
there
is
a
worth
in
thy
honest
ignorance
,
brother
*NL*
Toby
--
`
twere
almost
a
pity
to
exchange
it
for
a
knowledge
.
--
But
I
'll
*NL*
tell
thee
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
To
understand
what
time
is
aright
,
without
which
we
never
can
comprehend
*NL*
infinity
,
insomuch
as
one
is
a
portion
of
the
other
--
we
ought
seriously
*NL*
to
sit
down
and
consider
what
idea
it
is
we
have
of
duration
,
so
as
*NL*
to
give
a
satisfactory
account
how
we
came
by
it
.
--
What
is
that
to
any
*NL*
body
?
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
-LRB-
Vide
Locke

-RRB-
For
if
you
will
turn
your
eyes
*NL*
inwards
upon
your
mind
,
continued
my
father
,
and
observe
attentively
,
*NL*
you
will
perceive
,
brother
,
that
whilst
you
and
I
are
talking
together
,
*NL*
and
thinking
,
and
smoking
our
pipes
,
or
whilst
we
receive
successively
*NL*
ideas
in
our
minds
,
we
know
that
we
do
exist
,
and
so
we
estimate
the
*NL*
existence
,
or
the
continuation
of
the
existence
of
ourselves
,
or
any
*NL*
thing
else
,
commensurate
to
the
succession
of
any
ideas
in
our
minds
,
*NL*
the
duration
of
ourselves
,
or
any
such
other
thing
co-existing
with
our
*NL*
thinking
--
and
so
according
to
that
preconceived
--
You
puzzle
me
to
death
,
*NL*
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
owing
to
this
,
replied
my
father
,
that
in
our
computations
of
*NL*
time
,
we
are
so
used
to
minutes
,
hours
,
weeks
,
and
months
--
and
of
clocks
*NL*
-LRB-
I
wish
there
was
not
a
clock
in
the
kingdom
-RRB-
to
measure
out
their
*NL*
several
portions
to
us
,
and
to
those
who
belong
to
us
--
that
`
twill
be
*NL*
well
,
if
in
time
to
come
,
the
succession
of
our
ideas
be
of
any
use
or
*NL*
service
to
us
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
whether
we
observe
it
or
no
,
continued
my
father
,
in
every
sound
*NL*
man
's
head
,
there
is
a
regular
succession
of
ideas
of
one
sort
or
other
,
*NL*
which
follow
each
other
in
train
just
like
--
A
train
of
artillery
?
said
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
--
A
train
of
a
fiddle-stick
!
--
quoth
my
father
--
which
follow
*NL*
and
succeed
one
another
in
our
minds
at
certain
distances
,
just
like
*NL*
the
images
in
the
inside
of

lanthorn
turned
round
by
the
heat
of
*NL*
a

.

I
declare
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
mine
are
more
like
a
*NL*
smoke-jack

--
Then
,
brother
Toby
,
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
you
upon

moods
--
in
eager
pursuit
of

metaphysical
point
into

the
very

where
clouds

thick
darkness
would

have

my

Toby
in
one

finest
dispositions
*NL*
for
it
in

;

his
head
like

--
the
funnel
unswept

*NL*
and
the
ideas
whirling
round
and
round
about
in

all
obfuscated
and

darkened
over

the
petulancy

out

piqued
as

was
at

there
was
something
in
the
comparison
at
the

bottom

which
hit
his
fancy
;
for
which
purpose
,
resting
his
elbow
upon

the
table
,
and
reclining
the
right
side
of
his
head
upon
the
palm
of
his
*NL*
hand

but
looking
first
stedfastly
in
the
fire
--
he
began
to
commune
with
*NL*
himself
,
and
philosophize
about
it
:
but
his
spirits
being
wore
out
with
*NL*
the
fatigues
of
investigating
new
tracts
,
and
the
constant
exertion
of
*NL*
his
faculties
upon
that
variety
of
subjects
which
had
taken
their
turn
*NL*
in
the
discourse
--
the
idea
of
the
smoke
jack
soon
turned
all
his
ideas
*NL*
upside
down

so
that
he
fell
asleep
almost

knew

was
*NL*
about

As

*NL*
great
Author
and
Bestower
of
them
had
thought
fit
originally
to
give
*NL*
me
--
so
that
,
as
your
worships
see
--
't
is
just
as
God
pleases
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Agalastes
-LRB-
speaking
dispraisingly
-RRB-
sayeth
,
That
there
may
be
some
*NL*
wit
in
it
,
for
aught
he
knows
--
but
no
judgment
at
all
.
And
Triptolemus
*NL*
and
Phutatorius
agreeing
thereto
,
ask
,
How
is
it
possible
there
should
?
*NL*
for
that
wit
and
judgment
in
this
world
never
go
together
;
inasmuch
as
*NL*
they
are
two
operations
differing
from
each
other
as
wide
as
east
from
*NL*
west
--
So
,
says
Locke
--
so
are
farting
and
hickuping
,
say
I
.
But
in
answer
*NL*
to
this
,
Didius
the
great
church
lawyer
,
in
his
code
de
fartendi
et
*NL*
illustrandi
fallaciis
,
doth
maintain
and
make
fully
appear
,
That
*NL*
an
illustration
is
no
argument
--
nor
do
I
maintain
the
wiping
of
a
*NL*
looking-glass
clean
to
be
a
syllogism
;
--
but
you
all
,
may
it
please
your
*NL*
worships
,
see
the
better
for
it
--
so
that
the
main
good
these
things
do
*NL*
is
only
to
clarify
the
understanding
,
previous
to
the
application
of
the
*NL*
argument
itself
,
in
order
to
free
it
from
any
little
motes
,
or
specks
*NL*
of
opacular
matter
,
which
,
if
left
swimming
therein
,
might
hinder
a
*NL*
conception
and
spoil
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
my
dear
anti-Shandeans
,
and
thrice
able
criticks
,
and
*NL*
fellow-labourers
-LRB-
for
to
you
I
write
this
Preface
-RRB-
--
and
to
you
,
most
*NL*
subtle
statesmen
and
discreet
doctors
-LRB-
do
--
pull
off
your
beards
-RRB-
*NL*
renowned
for
gravity
and
wisdom
;
--
Monopolus
,
my
politician
--
Didius
,
my
*NL*
counsel
;
Kysarcius
,
my
friend
;
--
Phutatorius
,
my
guide
;
--
Gastripheres
,
*NL*
the
preserver
of
my
life
;
Somnolentius
,
the
balm
and
repose
of
it
--
not
*NL*
forgetting
all
others
,
as
well
sleeping
as
waking
,
ecclesiastical
as
*NL*
civil
,
whom
for
brevity
,
but
out
of
no
resentment
to
you
,
I
lump
all
*NL*
together
.
--
Believe
me
,
right
worthy
,
*NL*
*NL*
My
most
zealous
wish
and
fervent
prayer
in
your
behalf
,
and
in
my
own
*NL*
too
,
in
case
the
thing
is
not
done
already
for
us
--
is
,
that
the
great
*NL*
gifts
and
endowments
both
of
wit
and
judgment
,
with
every
thing
which
*NL*
usually
goes
along
with
them
--
such
as
memory
,
fancy
,
genius
,
eloquence
,
*NL*
quick
parts
,
and
what
not
,
may
this
precious
moment
,
without
stint
or
*NL*
measure
,
let
or
hindrance
,
be
poured
down
warm
as
each
of
us
could
bear
*NL*
it
--
scum
and
sediment
and
all
-LRB-
for
I
would
not
have
a
drop
lost
-RRB-
into
*NL*
the
several
receptacles
,
cells
,
cellules
,
domiciles
,
dormitories
,
*NL*
refectories
,
and
spare
places
of
our
brains
--
in
such
sort
,
that
they
*NL*
might
continue
to
be
injected
and
tunn
'd
into
,
according
to
the
true
*NL*
intent
and
meaning
of
my
wish
,
until
every
vessel
of
them
,
both
great
*NL*
and
small
,
be
so
replenish
'd
,
saturated
,
and
filled
up
therewith
,
that
*NL*
no
more
,
would
it
save
a
man
's
life
,
could
possibly
be
got
either
in
or
*NL*
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bless
us
!
--
what
noble
work
we
should
make
!
--
how
should
I
tickle
it
*NL*
off
!
--
and
what
spirits
should
I
find
myself
in
,
to
be
writing
away
for
*NL*
such
readers
!
--
and
you
--
just
heaven
!
--
with
what
raptures
would
you
sit
*NL*
and
read
--
but
oh
!
--
't
is
too
much
--
I
am
sick
--
I
faint
away
deliciously
at
*NL*
the
thoughts
of
it
--
't
is
more
than
nature
can
bear
!
--
lay
hold
of
*NL*
me
--
I
am
giddy
--
I
am
stone
blind
--
I
'm
dying
--
I
am
gone
.
--
Help
!
Help
!
*NL*
Help
!
--
But
hold
--
I
grow
something
better
again
,
for
I
am
beginning
to
*NL*
foresee
,
when
this
is
over
,
that
as
we
shall
all
of
us
continue
to
*NL*
be
great
wits
--
we
should
never
agree
amongst
ourselves
,
one
day
to
an
*NL*
end
:
--
there
would
be
so
much
satire
and
sarcasm
--
scoffing
and
flouting
,
*NL*
with
raillying
and
reparteeing
of
it
--
thrusting
and
parrying
in
one
*NL*
corner
or
another
--
there
would
be
nothing
but
mischief
among
us
--
Chaste
*NL*
stars
!
what
biting
and
scratching
,
and
what
a
racket
and
a
clatter
*NL*
we
should
make
,
what
with
breaking
of
heads
,
rapping
of
knuckles
,
and
*NL*
hitting
of
sore
places
--
there
would
be
no
such
thing
as
living
for
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
again
,
as
we
should
all
of
us
be
men
of
great
judgment
,
we
*NL*
should
make
up
matters
as
fast
as
ever
they
went
wrong
;
and
though
*NL*
we
should
abominate
each
other
ten
times
worse
than
so
many
devils
or
*NL*
devilesses
,
we
should
nevertheless
,
my
dear
creatures
,
be
all
courtesy
*NL*
and
kindness
,
milk
and
honey
--
`
twould
be
a
second
land
of
promise
--
a
*NL*
paradise
upon
earth
,
if
there
was
such
a
thing
to
be
had
--
so
that
upon
*NL*
the
whole
we
should
have
done
well
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
I
fret
and
fume
at
,
and
what
most
distresses
my
invention
at
*NL*
present
,
is
how
to
bring
the
point
itself
to
bear
;
for
as
your
worships
*NL*
well
know
,
that
of
these
heavenly
emanations
of
wit
and
judgment
,
which
*NL*
I
have
so
bountifully
wished
both
for
your
worships
and
myself
--
there
*NL*
is
but
a
certain
quantum
stored
up
for
us
all
,
for
the
use
and
behoof
of
*NL*
the
whole
race
of
mankind
;
and
such
small
modicums
of
'em
are
only
sent
*NL*
forth
into
this
wide
world
,
circulating
here
and
there
in
one
bye
corner
*NL*
or
another
--
and
in
such
narrow
streams
,
and
at
such
prodigious
intervals
*NL*
from
each
other
,
that
one
would
wonder
how
it
holds
out
,
or
could
be
*NL*
sufficient
for
the
wants
and
emergencies
of
so
many
great
estates
,
and
*NL*
populous
empires
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
there
is
one
thing
to
be
considered
,
that
in
Nova
Zembla
,
North
*NL*
Lapland
,
and
in
all
those
cold
and
dreary
tracks
of
the
globe
,
which
lie
*NL*
more
directly
under
the
arctick
and
antartick
circles
,
where
the
whole
*NL*
province
of
a
man
's
concernments
lies
for
near
nine
months
together
*NL*
within
the
narrow
compass
of
his
cave
--
where
the
spirits
are
compressed
*NL*
almost
to
nothing
--
and
where
the
passions
of
a
man
,
with
every
thing
*NL*
which
belongs
to
them
,
are
as
frigid
as
the
zone
itself
--
there
the
least
*NL*
quantity
of
judgment
imaginable
does
the
business
--
and
of
wit
--
there
is
*NL*
a
total
and
an
absolute
saving
--
for
as
not
one
spark
is
wanted
--
so
not
*NL*
one
spark
is
given
.
Angels
and
ministers
of
grace
defend
us
!
what
a
*NL*
dismal
thing
would
it
have
been
to
have
governed
a
kingdom
,
to
have
*NL*
fought
a
battle
,
or
made
a
treaty
,
or
run
a
match
,
or
wrote
a
book
,
or
*NL*
got
a
child
,
or
held
a
provincial
chapter
there
,
with
so
plentiful
a
*NL*
lack
of
wit
and
judgment
about
us
!
For
mercy
's
sake
,
let
us
think
*NL*
no
more
about
it
,
but
travel
on
as
fast
as
we
can
southwards
into
*NL*
Norway
--
crossing
over
Swedeland
,
if
you
please
,
through
the
small
*NL*
triangular
province
of
Angermania
to
the
lake
of
Bothmia
;
coasting
along
*NL*
it
through
east
and
west
Bothnia
,
down
to
Carelia
,
and
so
on
,
through
*NL*
all
those
states
and
provinces
which
border
upon
the
far
side
of
the
*NL*
Gulf
of
Finland
,
and
the
north-east
of
the
Baltick
,
up
to
Petersbourg
,
*NL*
and
just
stepping
into
Ingria
;
--
then
stretching
over
directly
from
*NL*
thence
through
the
north
parts
of
the
Russian
empire
--
leaving
Siberia
*NL*
a
little
upon
the
left
hand
,
till
we
got
into
the
very
heart
of
Russian
*NL*
and
Asiatick
Tartary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
through
this
long
tour
which
I
have
led
you
,
you
observe
the
good
*NL*
people
are
better
off
by
far
,
than
in
the
polar
countries
which
we
have
*NL*
just
left
:
--
for
if
you
hold
your
hand
over
your
eyes
,
and
look
very
*NL*
attentively
,
you
may
perceive
some
small
glimmerings
-LRB-
as
it
were
-RRB-
of
*NL*
wit
,
with
a
comfortable
provision
of
good
plain
houshold
judgment
,
*NL*
which
,
taking
the
quality
and
quantity
of
it
together
,
they
make
a
very
*NL*
good
shift
with
--
and
had
they
more
of
either
the
one
or
the
other
,
*NL*
it
would
destroy
the
proper
balance
betwixt
them
,
and
I
am
satisfied
*NL*
moreover
they
would
want
occasions
to
put
them
to
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Sir
,
if
I
conduct
you
home
again
into
this
warmer
and
more
*NL*
luxuriant
island
,
where
you
perceive
the
spring-tide
of
our
blood
and
*NL*
humours
runs
high
--
where
we
have
more
ambition
,
and
pride
,
and
envy
,
*NL*
and
lechery
,
and
other
whoreson
passions
upon
our
hands
to
govern
and
*NL*
subject
to
reason
--
the
height
of
our
wit
,
and
the
depth
of
our
judgment
,
*NL*
you
see
,
are
exactly
proportioned
to
the
length
and
breadth
of
our
*NL*
necessities
--
and
accordingly
we
have
them
sent
down
amongst
us
in
such
a
*NL*
flowing
kind
of
decent
and
creditable
plenty
,
that
no
one
thinks
he
has
*NL*
any
cause
to
complain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
however
be
confessed
on
this
head
,
that
,
as
our
air
blows
hot
*NL*
and
cold
--
wet
and
dry
,
ten
times
in
a
day
,
we
have
them
in
no
regular
*NL*
and
settled
way
;
--
so
that
sometimes
for
near
half
a
century
together
,
*NL*
there
shall
be
very
little
wit
or
judgment
either
to
be
seen
or
heard
of
*NL*
amongst
us
:
--
the
small
channels
of
them
shall
seem
quite
dried
up
--
then
*NL*
all
of
a
sudden
the
sluices
shall
break
out
,
and
take
a
fit
of
running
*NL*
again
like
fury
--
you
would
think
they
would
never
stop
:
--
and
then
it
is
,
*NL*
that
in
writing
,
and
fighting
,
and
twenty
other
gallant
things
,
we
drive
*NL*
all
the
world
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
by
these
observations
,
and
a
wary
reasoning
by
analogy
in
*NL*
that
kind
of
argumentative
process
,
which
Suidas
calls
dialectick
*NL*
induction
--
that
I
draw
and
set
up
this
position
as
most
true
and
*NL*
veritable
;
*NL*
*NL*
That
of
these
two
luminaries
so
much
of
their
irradiations
are
suffered
*NL*
from
time
to
time
to
shine
down
upon
us
,
as
he
,
whose
infinite
wisdom
*NL*
which
dispenses
every
thing
in
exact
weight
and
measure
,
knows
will
just
*NL*
serve
to
light
us
on
our
way
in
this
night
of
our
obscurity
;
so
that
*NL*
your
reverences
and
worships
now
find
out
,
nor
is
it
a
moment
longer
in
*NL*
my
power
to
conceal
it
from
you
,
That
the
fervent
wish
in
your
behalf
*NL*
with
which
I
set
out
,
was
no
more
than
the
first
insinuating
How
d'ye
of
*NL*
a
caressing
prefacer
,
stifling
his
reader
,
as
a
lover
sometimes
does
a
*NL*
coy
mistress
,
into
silence
.
For
alas
!
could
this
effusion
of
light
have
*NL*
been
as
easily
procured
,
as
the
exordium
wished
it
--
I
tremble
to
think
*NL*
how
many
thousands
for
it
,
of
benighted
travellers
-LRB-
in
the
learned
*NL*
sciences
at
least
-RRB-
must
have
groped
and
blundered
on
in
the
dark
,
*NL*
all
the
nights
of
their
lives
--
running
their
heads
against
posts
,
*NL*
and
knocking
out
their
brains
without
ever
getting
to
their
journies
*NL*
end
;
--
some
falling
with
their
noses
perpendicularly
into
sinks
--
others
*NL*
horizontally
with
their
tails
into
kennels
.
Here
one
half
of
a
learned
*NL*
profession
tilting
full
but
against
the
other
half
of
it
,
and
then
*NL*
tumbling
and
rolling
one
over
the
other
in
the
dirt
like
hogs
.
--
Here
*NL*
the
brethren
of
another
profession
,
who
should
have
run
in
opposition
to
*NL*
each
other
,
flying
on
the
contrary
like
a
flock
of
wild
geese
,
all
in
*NL*
a
row
the
same
way
.
--
What
confusion
!
--
what
mistakes
!
--
fiddlers
and
*NL*
painters
judging
by
their
eyes
and
ears
--
admirable
!
--
trusting
to
*NL*
the
passions
excited
--
in
an
air
sung
,
or
a
story
painted
to
the
*NL*
heart
--
instead
of
measuring
them
by
a
quadrant
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fore-ground
of
this
picture
,
a
statesman
turning
the
political
*NL*
wheel
,
like
a
brute
,
the
wrong
way
round
--
against
the
stream
of
*NL*
corruption
--
by
Heaven
!
--
instead
of
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
corner
,
a
son
of
the
divine
Esculapius
,
writing
a
book
against
*NL*
predestination
;
perhaps
worse
--
feeling
his
patient
's
pulse
,
instead
of
*NL*
his
apothecary
's
--
a
brother
of
the
Faculty
in
the
back-ground
upon
his
*NL*
knees
in
tears
--
drawing
the
curtains
of
a
mangled
victim
to
beg
his
*NL*
forgiveness
;
--
offering
a
fee
--
instead
of
taking
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
spacious
Hall
,
a
coalition
of
the
gown
,
from
all
the
bars
of
*NL*
it
,
driving
a
damn
'd
,
dirty
,
vexatious
cause
before
them
,
with
all
*NL*
their
might
and
main
,
the
wrong
way
!
--
kicking
it
out
of
the
great
doors
,
*NL*
instead
of
,
in
--
and
with
such
fury
in
their
looks
,
and
such
a
degree
*NL*
of
inveteracy
in
their
manner
of
kicking
it
,
as
if
the
laws
had
been
*NL*
originally
made
for
the
peace
and
preservation
of
mankind
:
--
perhaps
a
*NL*
more
enormous
mistake
committed
by
them
still
--
a
litigated
point
fairly
*NL*
hung
up
;
--
for
instance
,
Whether
John
o'Nokes
his
nose
could
stand
in
Tom
*NL*
o'Stiles
his
face
,
without
a
trespass
,
or
not
--
rashly
determined
by
*NL*
them
in
five-and-twenty
minutes
,
which
,
with
the
cautious
pros
and
*NL*
cons
required
in
so
intricate
a
proceeding
,
might
have
taken
up
as
many
*NL*
months
--
and
if
carried
on
upon
a
military
plan
,
as
your
honours
know
an
*NL*
Action
should
be
,
with
all
the
stratagems
practicable
therein
,
--
such
as
*NL*
feints
,
--
forced
marches
,
--
surprizes
--
ambuscades
--
mask-batteries
,
and
a
*NL*
thousand
other
strokes
of
generalship
,
which
consist
in
catching
at
*NL*
all
advantages
on
both
sides
--
might
reasonably
have
lasted
them
as
many
*NL*
years
,
finding
food
and
raiment
all
that
term
for
a
centumvirate
of
the
*NL*
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
Clergy
--
No
--
if
I
say
a
word
against
them
,
I
'll
be
shot
.
--
I
*NL*
have
no
desire
;
and
besides
,
if
I
had
--
I
durst
not
for
my
soul
touch
*NL*
upon
the
subject
--
with
such
weak
nerves
and
spirits
,
and
in
the
*NL*
condition
I
am
in
at
present
,
`
twould
be
as
much
as
my
life
was
worth
,
*NL*
to
deject
and
contrist
myself
with
so
bad
and
melancholy
an
account
--
and
*NL*
therefore
't
is
safer
to
draw
a
curtain
across
,
and
hasten
from
it
,
as
*NL*
fast
as
I
can
,
to
the
main
and
principal
point
I
have
undertaken
to
*NL*
clear
up
--
and
that
is
,
How
it
comes
to
pass
,
that
your
men
of
least
wit
*NL*
are
reported
to
be
men
of
most
judgment
.
--
But
mark
--
I
say
,
reported
*NL*
to
be
--
for
it
is
no
more
,
my
dear
Sirs
,
than
a
report
,
and
which
,
like
*NL*
twenty
others
taken
up
every
day
upon
trust
,
I
maintain
to
be
a
vile
and
*NL*
a
malicious
report
into
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
by
the
help
of
the
observation
already
premised
,
and
I
hope
already
*NL*
weighed
and
perpended
by
your
reverences
and
worships
,
I
shall
forthwith
*NL*
make
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hate
set
dissertations
--
and
above
all
things
in
the
world
,
't
is
one
of
*NL*
the
silliest
things
in
one
of
them
,
to
darken
your
hypothesis
by
placing
*NL*
a
number
of
tall
,
opake
words
,
one
before
another
,
in
a
right
line
,
*NL*
betwixt
your
own
and
your
reader
's
conception
--
when
in
all
likelihood
,
*NL*
if
you
had
looked
about
,
you
might
have
seen
something
standing
,
or
*NL*
hanging
up
,
which
would
have
cleared
the
point
at
once
--
`
for
what
*NL*
hindrance
,
hurt
,
or
harm
doth
the
laudable
desire
of
knowledge
bring
to
*NL*
any
man
,
if
even
from
a
sot
,
a
pot
,
a
fool
,
a
stool
,
a
winter-mittain
,
*NL*
a
truckle
for
a
pully
,
the
lid
of
a
goldsmith
's
crucible
,
an
oil
bottle
,
*NL*
an
old
slipper
,
or
a
cane
chair
?
'
--
I
am
this
moment
sitting
upon
one
.
*NL*
Will
you
give
me
leave
to
illustrate
this
affair
of
wit
and
judgment
,
by
*NL*
the
two
knobs
on
the
top
of
the
back
of
it
?
--
they
are
fastened
on
,
you
*NL*
see
,
with
two
pegs
stuck
slightly
into
two
gimlet-holes
,
and
will
place
*NL*
what
I
have
to
say
in
so
clear
a
light
,
as
to
let
you
see
through
the
*NL*
drift
and
meaning
of
my
whole
preface
,
as
plainly
as
if
every
point
and
*NL*
particle
of
it
was
made
up
of
sun-beams
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
enter
now
directly
upon
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
stands
wit
--
and
there
stands
judgment
,
close
beside
it
,
just
like
*NL*
the
two
knobs
I
'm
speaking
of
,
upon
the
back
of
this
self-same
chair
on
*NL*
which
I
am
sitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
see
,
they
are
the
highest
and
most
ornamental
parts
of
its
*NL*
frame
--
as
wit
and
judgment
are
of
ours
--
and
like
them
too
,
indubitably
*NL*
both
made
and
fitted
to
go
together
,
in
order
,
as
we
say
in
all
such
*NL*
cases
of
duplicated
embellishments
--
to
answer
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
for
the
sake
of
an
experiment
,
and
for
the
clearer
illustrating
this
*NL*
matter
--
let
us
for
a
moment
take
off
one
of
these
two
curious
ornaments
*NL*
-LRB-
I
care
not
which
-RRB-
from
the
point
or
pinnacle
of
the
chair
it
now
stands
*NL*
on
--
nay
,
do
n't
laugh
at
it
,
--
but
did
you
ever
see
,
in
the
whole
course
*NL*
of
your
lives
,
such
a
ridiculous
business
as
this
has
made
of
it
?
--
Why
,
*NL*
't
is
as
miserable
a
sight
as
a
sow
with
one
ear
;
and
there
is
just
as
*NL*
much
sense
and
symmetry
in
the
one
as
in
the
other
:
--
do
--
pray
,
get
off
*NL*
your
seats
only
to
take
a
view
of
it
,
--
Now
would
any
man
who
valued
his
*NL*
character
a
straw
,
have
turned
a
piece
of
work
out
of
his
hand
in
such
a
*NL*
condition
?
--
nay
,
lay
your
hands
upon
your
hearts
,
and
answer
this
plain
*NL*
question
,
Whether
this
one
single
knob
,
which
now
stands
here
like
a
*NL*
blockhead
by
itself
,
can
serve
any
purpose
upon
earth
,
but
to
put
one
*NL*
in
mind
of
the
want
of
the
other
?
--
and
let
me
farther
ask
,
in
case
the
*NL*
chair
was
your
own
,
if
you
would
not
in
your
consciences
think
,
rather
*NL*
than
be
as
it
is
,
that
it
would
be
ten
times
better
without
any
knob
at
*NL*
all
?
*NL*
*NL*
Now
these
two
knobs
--
or
top
ornaments
of
the
mind
of
man
,
which
crown
*NL*
the
whole
entablature
--
being
,
as
I
said
,
wit
and
judgment
,
which
of
all
*NL*
others
,
as
I
have
proved
it
,
are
the
most
needful
--
the
most
priz
'd
--
the
*NL*
most
calamitous
to
be
without
,
and
consequently
the
hardest
to
come
*NL*
at
--
for
all
these
reasons
put
together
,
there
is
not
a
mortal
among
us
,
*NL*
so
destitute
of
a
love
of
good
fame
or
feeding
--
or
so
ignorant
of
what
*NL*
will
do
him
good
therein
--
who
does
not
wish
and
stedfastly
resolve
in
*NL*
his
own
mind
,
to
be
,
or
to
be
thought
at
least
,
master
of
the
one
or
the
*NL*
other
,
and
indeed
of
both
of
them
,
if
the
thing
seems
any
way
feasible
,
*NL*
or
likely
to
be
brought
to
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
your
graver
gentry
having
little
or
no
kind
of
chance
in
aiming
at
*NL*
the
one
--
unless
they
laid
hold
of
the
other
,
--
pray
what
do
you
think
*NL*
would
become
of
them
?
--
Why
,
Sirs
,
in
spite
of
all
their
gravities
,
*NL*
they
must
e
`
en
have
been
contented
to
have
gone
with
their
insides
*NL*
naked
--
this
was
not
to
be
borne
,
but
by
an
effort
of
philosophy
not
to
*NL*
be
supposed
in
the
case
we
are
upon
--
so
that
no
one
could
well
have
been
*NL*
angry
with
them
,
had
they
been
satisfied
with
what
little
they
could
*NL*
have
snatched
up
and
secreted
under
their
cloaks
and
great
perriwigs
,
*NL*
had
they
not
raised
a
hue
and
cry
at
the
same
time
against
the
lawful
*NL*
owners
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
need
not
tell
your
worships
,
that
this
was
done
with
so
much
cunning
*NL*
and
artifice
--
that
the
great
Locke
,
who
was
seldom
outwitted
by
false
*NL*
sounds
--
was
nevertheless
bubbled
here
.
The
cry
,
it
seems
,
was
so
deep
*NL*
and
solemn
a
one
,
and
what
with
the
help
of
great
wigs
,
grave
faces
,
and
*NL*
other
implements
of
deceit
,
was
rendered
so
general
a
one
against
the
*NL*
poor
wits
in
this
matter
,
that
the
philosopher
himself
was
deceived
by
*NL*
it
--
it
was
his
glory
to
free
the
world
from
the
lumber
of
a
thousand
*NL*
vulgar
errors
;
--
but
this
was
not
of
the
number
;
so
that
instead
of
*NL*
sitting
down
coolly
,
as
such
a
philosopher
should
have
done
,
to
have
*NL*
examined
the
matter
of
fact
before
he
philosophised
upon
it
--
on
the
*NL*
contrary
he
took
the
fact
for
granted
,
and
so
joined
in
with
the
cry
,
*NL*
and
halloo
'd
it
as
boisterously
as
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
has
been
made
the
Magna
Charta
of
stupidity
ever
since
--
but
your
*NL*
reverences
plainly
see
,
it
has
been
obtained
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
*NL*
title
to
it
is
not
worth
a
groat
:
--
which
by-the-bye
is
one
of
the
many
*NL*
and
vile
impositions
which
gravity
and
grave
folks
have
to
answer
for
*NL*
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
great
wigs
,
upon
which
I
may
be
thought
to
have
spoken
my
mind
*NL*
too
freely
--
I
beg
leave
to
qualify
whatever
has
been
unguardedly
said
to
*NL*
their
dispraise
or
prejudice
,
by
one
general
declaration
--
That
I
have
*NL*
no
abhorrence
whatever
,
nor
do
I
detest
and
abjure
either
great
wigs
or
*NL*
long
beards
,
any
farther
than
when
I
see
they
are
bespoke
and
let
grow
*NL*
on
purpose
to
carry
on
this
self-same
imposture
--
for
any
purpose
--
peace
*NL*
be
with
them
!

mark
only
--
I
write
not
for
them

Every
day
for
at
least
ten
years
together
did
my
father
resolve
to
have
*NL*
it
mended
--
't
is
not
mended
yet
;
--
no
family
but
ours
would
have
borne
*NL*
with
it
an
hour
--
and
what
is
most
astonishing
,
there
was
not
a
subject
*NL*
in
the
world
upon
which
my
father
was
so
eloquent
,
as
upon
that
of
*NL*
door-hinges
.
--
And
yet
at
the
same
time
,
he
was
certainly
one
of
the
*NL*
greatest
bubbles
to
them
,
I
think
,
that
history
can
produce
:
his
*NL*
rhetorick
and
conduct
were
at
perpetual
handy-cuffs
.
--
Never
did
the
*NL*
parlour-door
open
--
but
his
philosophy
or
his
principles
fell
a
victim
to
*NL*
it
;
--
three
drops
of
oil
with
a
feather
,
and
a
smart
stroke
of
a
hammer
,
*NL*
had
saved
his
honour
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Inconsistent
soul
that
man
is
!
--
languishing
under
wounds
,
which
he
*NL*
has
the
power
to
heal
!
--
his
whole
life
a
contradiction
to
his
*NL*
knowledge
!
--
his
reason
,
that
precious
gift
of
God
to
him
--
-LRB-
instead
of
*NL*
pouring
in
oil
-RRB-
serving
but
to
sharpen
his
sensibilities
--
to
multiply
*NL*
his
pains
,
and
render
him
more
melancholy
and
uneasy
under
them
!
--
Poor
*NL*
unhappy
creature
,
that
he
should
do
so
!
--
Are
not
the
necessary
causes
of
*NL*
misery
in
this
life
enow
,
but
he
must
add
voluntary
ones
to
his
stock
of
*NL*
sorrow
;
--
struggle
against
evils
which
can
not
be
avoided
,
and
submit
to
*NL*
others
,
which
a
tenth
part
of
the
trouble
they
create
him
would
remove
*NL*
from
his
heart
for
ever
?
*NL*
*NL*
By
all
that
is
good
and
virtuous
,
if
there
are
three
drops
of
oil
to
*NL*
be
got
,
and
a
hammer
to
be
found
within
ten
miles
of
Shandy
Hall

the
*NL*
parlour
door
hinge
shall
be
mended

When
Corporal
Trim
had
brought
his
two
mortars
to
bear
,
he
was
delighted
*NL*
with
his
handy-work
above
measure
;
and
knowing
what
a
pleasure
it
would
*NL*
be
to
his
master
to
see
them
,
he
was
not
able
to
resist
the
desire
he
*NL*
had
of
carrying
them
directly
into
his
parlour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
next
to
the
moral
lesson
I
had
in
view
in
mentioning
the
affair
of
*NL*
hinges
,
I
had
a
speculative
consideration
arising
out
of
it
,
and
it
is
*NL*
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
parlour
door
opened
and
turn
'd
upon
its
hinges
,
as
a
door
should
*NL*
do
--
*NL*
*NL*
Or
for
example
,
as
cleverly
as
our
government
has
been
turning
upon
*NL*
its
hinges
--
-LRB-
that
is
,
in
case
things
have
all
along
gone
well
with
your
*NL*
worship
,
--
otherwise
I
give
up
my
simile
-RRB-
--
in
this
case
,
I
say
,
there
had
*NL*
been
no
danger
either
to
master
or
man
,
in
corporal
Trim
's
peeping
in
:
*NL*
the
moment
he
had
beheld
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
fast
asleep
--
the
*NL*
respectfulness
of
his
carriage
was
such
,
he
would
have
retired
as
silent
*NL*
as
death
,
and
left
them
both
in
their
arm-chairs
,
dreaming
as
happy
*NL*
as
he
had
found
them
:
but
the
thing
was
,
morally
speaking
,
so
very
*NL*
impracticable
,
that
for
the
many
years
in
which
this
hinge
was
suffered
*NL*
to
be
out
of
order
,
and
amongst
the
hourly
grievances
my
father
*NL*
submitted
to
upon
its
account
--
this
was
one
;
that
he
never
folded
his
*NL*
arms
to
take
his
nap
after
dinner
,
but
the
thoughts
of
being
unavoidably
*NL*
awakened
by
the
first
person
who
should
open
the
door
,
was
always
*NL*
uppermost
in
his
imagination
,
and
so
incessantly
stepp
'd
in
betwixt
him
*NL*
and
the
first
balmy
presage
of
his
repose
,
as
to
rob
him
,
as
he
often
*NL*
declared
,
of
the
whole
sweets
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
things
move
upon
bad
hinges
,
an
'
please
your
lordships
,
how
can
it
*NL*
be
otherwise
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Pray
what
's
the
matter
?
Who
is
there
?
cried
my
father
,
waking
,
the
*NL*
moment
the
door
began
to
creak
.
--
I
wish
the
smith
would
give
a
peep
at
*NL*
that
confounded
hinge
.
--
'T
is
nothing
,
an
please

said
Trim

*NL*
but
two
mortars
I
am
bringing
in
.

They
sha
n't
make
a
clatter
with
them
*NL*
here
,
cried
my
father
hastily
.
--
If
Dr.
Slop
has
any
drugs
to
pound
,
let
*NL*
him
do
it
in
the
kitchen
.
--
May
it
please
your
honour
,
cried
Trim
,
they
*NL*
are
two
mortar-pieces
for
a
siege
next
summer
,
which
I
have
been
making
*NL*
out
of
a
pair
of
jack-boots
,
which
Obadiah
told
me
your
honour
had
left
*NL*
off
wearing
.
--
By
Heaven
!
cried
my
father
,
springing
out
of
his
chair
,
*NL*
as
he
swore
--
I
have
not
one
appointment
belonging
to
me
,
which
I
set
*NL*
so
much
store
by
as
I
do
by
these
jack-boots
--
they
were
our
great
*NL*
grandfather
's
brother
Toby
--
they
were
hereditary
.
Then
I
fear
,
quoth
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
Trim
has
cut
off
the
entail
.
--
I
have
only
cut
off
the
tops
,
*NL*
an

your
honour
,
cried
Trim
--
I
hate
perpetuities
as
much
as
any
*NL*
man
alive
,
cried
my
father
--
but
these
jack-boots
,
continued
he
-LRB-
smiling
,
*NL*
though
very
angry
at
the
same
time
-RRB-
have
been
in
the

,
*NL*
ever
since
the
civil
wars
;
--
Sir
Roger
Shandy
wore
them
at
the
battle
*NL*
of
Marston-Moor
.
--
I
declare
I
would
not
have
taken
ten
pounds
for
*NL*
them
.
--
I
'll
pay
you
the
money
,
brother
Shandy
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
looking
at
the
two
mortars
with
infinite
pleasure
,
and
putting
his
hand
*NL*
into
his
breeches
pocket
as
he
viewed
them
--
I
'll
pay
you
the
ten
pounds
*NL*
this
moment
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Brother
Toby
,
replied
my
father
,
altering
his
tone
,
you
care
not
what
*NL*
money
you
dissipate
and
throw
away
,
provided
,
continued
he
,
't
is
but
*NL*
upon
a
Siege
.
--
Have
I
not
one
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
,
besides
*NL*
my
half
pay
?
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
What
is
that
--
replied
my
father
*NL*
hastily
--
to
ten
pounds
for
a
pair
of
jack-boots
?
--
twelve
guineas
for
*NL*
your
pontoons
?
--
half
as
much
for
your
Dutch
draw-bridge
?
--
to
say
nothing
*NL*
of
the
train
of
little
brass
artillery
you
bespoke
last
week
,
with
*NL*
twenty
other
preparations
for
the
siege
of
Messina
:
believe
me
,
dear
*NL*
brother
Toby
,
continued
my
father
,
taking
him
kindly
by
the
hand
--
these
*NL*
military
operations
of
yours
are
above
your
strength
;
--
you
mean
well
*NL*
brother
--
but
they
carry
you
into
greater
expences
than
you
were
first
*NL*
aware
of
;
--
and
take
my
word
,
dear
Toby
,
they
will
in
the
end
quite
ruin
*NL*
your
fortune
,
and
make
a
beggar
of
you
.
--
What
signifies
it
if
they
do
,
*NL*
brother
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
so
long
as
we
know
't
is
for
the
good
of
*NL*
the
nation
?

*NL*
*NL*
My
father
could
not
help
smiling
for
his
soul
--
his
anger
at
the
worst
*NL*
was
never
more
than
a
spark
;

and
the
zeal
and
simplicity
of
Trim
--
and
*NL*
the
generous
-LRB-
though
hobby-horsical
-RRB-
gallantry
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
brought
*NL*
him
into
perfect
good
humour
with

in

All

my

at

Trim

There

making

as
he
spoke
,
*NL*
except
Dr.
Slop

cried
my
father
-LRB-
getting
upon
his
legs
a
*NL*
second
time
-RRB-

thing
has
gone
right

I
faith
*NL*
in

brother
,
-LRB-
which
,
by
the

,
my
father
had
-RRB-
I
would
have
*NL*
sworn
some
retrograde
planet
was
hanging
over
this
unfortunate
house
of
*NL*
mine
,
and
turning
every
individual
thing
in
it
out
of
its
place
.
--
Why
,
*NL*
I
thought
Dr.
Slop
had
been
above
stairs
with
my
wife
,
and
so
said
*NL*
you
.
--
What
can
the
fellow
be
puzzling
about
in
the
kitchen
!

He
is
busy

replied
Trim
,
in
making

'T

*NL*
obliging
in

quoth
my
uncle
Toby
:

pray
,
give
my
humble
service
to
*NL*
Dr.
Slop
,
Trim
,
and
tell
him
I
thank
him
heartily

*NL*
*NL*
You
must
know
,
my
uncle
Toby
mistook
the
bridge
--
as
widely
as
my
father
*NL*
mistook
the
mortars
:
--
but
to
understand
how
my
uncle
Toby
could
mistake
*NL*
the
bridge
--
I
fear
I
must
give
you
an
exact
account
of
the
road
which
*NL*
led
to
it
;
--
or
to
drop
my
metaphor
-LRB-
for
there
is
nothing
more
dishonest
*NL*
in
an
historian
than
the
use
of
one
-RRB-
--
in
order
to
conceive
the
*NL*
probability
of
this
error
in
my
uncle
Toby
aright
,
I
must
give
you
some
*NL*
account
of
an
adventure
of
Trim
's
,
though
much
against
my
will
,
I
say
*NL*
much
against
my
will
,
only
because
the
story
,
in
one
sense
,
is
certainly
*NL*
out
of
its
place
here
;
for
by
right
it
should
come
in
,
either
amongst
*NL*
the
anecdotes
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
amours
with
widow
Wadman
,
in
which
*NL*
corporal
Trim
was
no
mean
actor
--
or
else
in
the
middle
of
his
and
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
campaigns
on
the
bowling-green
--
for
it
will
do
very
well
in
*NL*
either
place
;

but
then
if
I
reserve
it
for
either
of
those
parts
of
my
*NL*
story
--
I
ruin
the
story
I
'm
upon
;

and
if
I
tell
it
here
--
I
anticipate
*NL*
matters
,
and
ruin
it
there
.
*NL*
*NL*

What
would
your
worship
have
me
to
do
in
this
case
?
*NL*
*NL*

Tell
it
,
Mr.
Shandy

by
all

You

what

*NL*
*NL*
Tho
'
the
shock
my
uncle
Toby
received
the
year
after
the
demolition
of
*NL*
Dunkirk
,
in
his
affair
with
widow
Wadman
,
had
fixed
him
in
a
resolution
*NL*
never
more
to
think
of
the
sex
--
or
of
aught
which
belonged
to
it
;
--
yet
*NL*
corporal
Trim
had
made
no
such
bargain
with
himself
.
Indeed
in
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
case
there
was
a
strange
and
unaccountable
concurrence
of
*NL*
circumstances
,
which
insensibly
drew
him
in
,
to
lay
siege
to
that
fair
*NL*
and
strong
citadel
.
--
In
Trim
's
case
there
was
a
concurrence
of
nothing
*NL*
in
the
world
,
but
of
him
and
Bridget
in
the
kitchen
;
--
though
in
truth
,
*NL*
the
love
and
veneration
he
bore
his
master
was
such
,
and
so
fond
was
he
*NL*
of
imitating
him
in
all
he
did
,
that
had
my
uncle
Toby
employed
his
*NL*
time
and
genius
in
tagging
of
points
--
I
am
persuaded
the
honest
corporal
*NL*
would
have
laid
down
his
arms
,
and
followed
his
example
with
pleasure
.
*NL*
When
therefore
my
uncle
Toby
sat
down
before
the
mistress
--
corporal
Trim
*NL*
incontinently
took
ground
before
the
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
my
dear
friend
Garrick
,
whom
I
have
so
much
cause
to
esteem
*NL*
and
honour
--
-LRB-
why
,
or
wherefore
,
't
is
no
matter
-RRB-
--
can
it
escape
your
*NL*
penetration
--
I
defy
it
--
that
so
many
play-wrights
,
and
opificers
of
*NL*
chit-chat
have
ever
since
been
working
upon
Trim
's
and
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
pattern
.
--
I
care
not
what
Aristotle
,
or
Pacuvius
,
or
Bossu
,
or
*NL*
Ricaboni
say
--
-LRB-
though
I
never
read
one
of
them
-RRB-
--
there
is
not
a
greater
*NL*
difference
between
a
single-horse
chair
and
madam
Pompadour
's
vis-a-vis
;
*NL*
than
betwixt
a
single
amour
,
and
an
amour
thus
nobly
doubled
,
and
going
*NL*
upon
all
four
,
prancing
throughout
a
grand
drama
--
Sir
,
a
simple
,
single
,
*NL*
silly
affair
of
that
kind
--
is
quite
lost
in
five
acts
--
but
that
is
*NL*
neither
here
nor
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
series
of
attacks
and
repulses
in
a
course
of
nine
months
on
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
quarter
,
a
most
minute
account
of
every
particular
of
which
*NL*
shall
be
given
in
its
proper
place
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
honest
man
!
found
*NL*
it
necessary
to
draw
off
his
forces
and
raise
the
siege
somewhat
*NL*
indignantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Corporal
Trim
,
as
I
said
,
had
made
no
such
bargain
either
with
*NL*
himself
--
or
with
any
one
else
--
the
fidelity
however
of
his
heart
not
*NL*
suffering
him
to
go
into
a
house
which
his
master
had
forsaken
with
*NL*
disgust
--
he
contented
himself
with
turning
his
part
of
the
siege
into
a
*NL*
blockade
;
--
that
is
,
he
kept
others
off
;
--
for
though
he
never
after
went
*NL*
to
the
house
,
yet
he
never
met
Bridget
in
the
village
,
but
he
*NL*
would
either
nod
or
wink
,
or
smile
,
or
look
kindly
at
her
--
or
-LRB-
as
*NL*
circumstances
directed
-RRB-
he
would
shake
her
by
the
hand
--
or
ask
her
*NL*
lovingly
how
she
did
--
or
would
give
her
a
ribbon
--
and
now-and-then
,
*NL*
though
never
but
when
it
could
be
done
with
decorum
,
would
give
Bridget
*NL*
a.
.
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Precisely
in
this
situation
,
did
these
things
stand
for
five
years
;
that
*NL*
is
from
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
in
the
year
13
,
to
the
latter
end
of
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaign
in
the
year
18
,
which
was
about
six
or
seven
*NL*
weeks
before
the
time
I
'm
speaking
of
.
--
When
Trim
,
as
his
custom
was
,
*NL*
after
he
had
put
my
uncle
Toby
to
bed
,
going
down
one
moon-shiny
night
*NL*
to
see
that
every
thing
was
right
at
his
fortifications
--
in
the
lane
*NL*
separated
from
the
bowling-green
with
flowering
shrubs
and
holly
--
he
*NL*
espied
his
Bridget
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
corporal
thought
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
so
well
worth
*NL*
shewing
as
the
glorious
works
which
he
and
my
uncle
Toby
had
made
,
Trim
*NL*
courteously
and
gallantly
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
led
her
in
:
this
was
*NL*
not
done
so
privately
,
but
that
the
foul-mouth
'd
trumpet
of
Fame
carried
*NL*
it
from
ear
to
ear
,
till
at
length
it
reach
'd
my
father
's
,
with
this
*NL*
untoward
circumstance
along
with
it
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
's
curious
*NL*
draw-bridge
,
constructed
and
painted
after
the
Dutch
fashion
,
and
*NL*
which
went
quite
across
the
ditch
--
was
broke
down
,
and
somehow
or
other
*NL*
crushed
all
to
pieces
that
very
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
as
you
have
observed
,
had
no
great
esteem
for
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
hobby-horse
;
he
thought
it
the
most
ridiculous
horse
that
ever
gentleman
*NL*
mounted
;
and
indeed
unless
my
uncle
Toby
vexed
him
about
it
,
could
never
*NL*
think
of
it
once
,
without
smiling
at
it
--
so
that
it
could
never
get
lame
*NL*
or
happen
any
mischance
,
but
it
tickled
my
father
's
imagination
beyond
*NL*
measure
;
but
this
being
an
accident
much
more
to
his
humour
than
any
*NL*
one
which
had
yet
befall
'n
it
,
it
proved
an
inexhaustible
fund
of
*NL*
entertainment
to
him
--
Well
--
but
dear
Toby
!
my
father
would
say
,
do
tell
*NL*
me
seriously
how
this
affair
of
the
bridge
happened
.
--
How
can
you
teaze
*NL*
me
so
much
about
it
?
my
uncle
Toby
would
reply
--
I
have
told
it
you
*NL*
twenty
times
,
word
for
word
as
Trim
told
it
me
.
--
Prithee
,
how
was
it
*NL*
then

corporal
?
my
father
would
cry
,
turning
to
Trim
.

It
was
a
mere
*NL*
misfortune
,
an

your

I
was
shewing
Mrs.

*NL*
our

in

of

I
*NL*
unfortunately
slipp

in

my

would
cry

smiling
*NL*
mysteriously
,
and
giving
a

interrupting
him

dragg
'd
her
after
me
,
by

of
which
she
fell
backwards
soss
against
*NL*
the
bridge
--
and
Trim
's
foot
-LRB-
my

Toby
would
cry
,
taking
the
story
*NL*
out
of
his
mouth
-RRB-
getting
into
the
cuvette
,
he
tumbled
full
against
the
*NL*
bridge
too
.
--
It
was
a
thousand
to
one
,
my
uncle
Toby
would
add
,
that
*NL*
the
poor
fellow
did
not
break
his
leg
.
--
Ay
truly
,
my
father
would
say
--
a
*NL*
limb
is
soon
broke
,
brother
Toby
,
in
such
encounters
.
--
And
so
,
an
'
*NL*
please
your
honour
,
the
bridge
,
which
your
honour
knows
was
a
very
*NL*
slight
one
,
was
broke
down
betwixt
us
,
and
splintered
all
to
pieces
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
other
times
,
but
especially
when
my
uncle
Toby
was
so
unfortunate
*NL*
as
to
say
a
syllable
about
cannons
,
bombs
,
or
petards
--
my
father
would
*NL*
exhaust
all
the
stores
of
his
eloquence
-LRB-
which
indeed
were
very
great
-RRB-
*NL*
in
a
panegyric
upon
the
Battering-Rams
of
the
ancients
--
the
Vinea
which
*NL*
Alexander
made
use
of
at
the
siege
of
Troy
.
--
He
would
tell
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
of
the
Catapultae
of
the
Syrians
,
which
threw
such
monstrous
stones
*NL*
so
many
hundred
feet
,
and
shook
the
strongest
bulwarks
from
their
very
*NL*
foundation
:
--
he
would
go
on
and
describe
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
*NL*
the
Ballista
which
Marcellinus
makes
so
much
rout
about
!
--
the
terrible
*NL*
effects
of
the
Pyraboli
,
which
cast
fire
;
--
the
danger
of
the
Terebra
and
*NL*
Scorpio
,
which
cast
javelins
.
--
But
what
are
these
,
would
he
say
,
to
the
*NL*
destructive
machinery
of
corporal
Trim
?
--
Believe
me
,
brother
Toby
,
no
*NL*
bridge
,
or
bastion
,
or
sally-port
,
that
ever
was
constructed
in
this
*NL*
world
,
can
hold
out
against
such
artillery
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
would
never
attempt
any
defence
against
the
force
of
this
*NL*
ridicule
,
but
that
of
redoubling
the
vehemence
of
smoaking
his
pipe
;
in
*NL*
doing
which
,
he
raised
so
dense
a
vapour
one
night
after
supper
,
that
*NL*
it
set
my
father
,
who
was
a
little
phthisical
,
into
a
suffocating
fit
of
*NL*
violent
coughing
:
my
uncle
Toby
leap
'd
up
without
feeling
the
pain
upon
*NL*
his
groin
--
and
,
with
infinite
pity
,
stood
beside
his
brother
's
chair
,
*NL*
tapping
his
back
with
one
hand
,
and
holding
his
head
with
the
other
,
and
*NL*
from
time
to
time
wiping
his
eyes
with
a
clean
cambrick
handkerchief
,
*NL*
which
he
pulled
out
of
his
pocket
.
--
The
affectionate
and
endearing
*NL*
manner
in
which
my
uncle
Toby
did
these
little
offices
--
cut
my
father
*NL*
thro
'
his
reins
,
for
the
pain
he
had
just
been
giving
him
.
--
May
my
*NL*
brains
be
knock
'd
out
with
a
battering-ram
or
a
catapulta
,
I
care
not
*NL*

quoth
my

The
draw-bridge
being
held
irreparable
,
Trim
was
ordered
directly
to
*NL*
set
about
another
--
but
not
upon
the
same
model
:
for
cardinal
Alberoni
's
*NL*
intrigues
at
that
time
being
discovered
,
and
my
uncle
Toby
rightly
*NL*
foreseeing
that
a
flame
would
inevitably
break
out
betwixt
Spain
and
*NL*
the
Empire
,
and
that
the
operations
of
the
ensuing
campaign
must
in
all
*NL*
likelihood
be
either
in
Naples
or
Sicily
--
he
determined
upon
an
*NL*
Italian
bridge
--
-LRB-
my
uncle
Toby
,
by-the-bye
,
was
not
far
out
of
his
*NL*
conjectures
-RRB-
--
but
my
father
,
who
was
infinitely
the
better
politician
,
*NL*
and
took
the
lead
as
far
of
my
uncle
Toby
in
the
cabinet
,
as
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
took
it
of
him
in
the
field
--
convinced
him
,
that
if
the
king
of
*NL*
Spain
and
the
Emperor
went
together
by
the
ears
,
England
and
France
and
*NL*
Holland
must
,
by
force
of
their
pre-engagements
,
all
enter
the
lists
*NL*
too
;
--
and
if
so
,
he
would
say
,
the
combatants
,
brother
Toby
,
as
sure
*NL*
as
we
are
alive
,
will
fall
to
it
again
,
pell-mell
,
upon
the
old
*NL*
prize-fighting
stage
of
Flanders
;
--
then
what
will
you
do
with
your
*NL*
Italian
bridge
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
will
go
on
with
it
then
upon
the
old
model
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
corporal
Trim
had
about
half
finished
it
in
that
style
--
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
found
out
a
capital
defect
in
it
,
which
he
had
never
thoroughly
*NL*
considered
before
.
It
turned
,
it
seems
,
upon
hinges
at
both
ends
of
*NL*
it
,
opening
in
the
middle
,
one
half
of
which
turning
to
one
side
of
the
*NL*
fosse
,
and
the
other
to
the
other
;
the
advantage
of
which
was
this
,
*NL*
that
by
dividing
the
weight
of
the
bridge
into
two
equal
portions
,
it
*NL*
impowered
my
uncle
Toby
to
raise
it
up
or
let
it
down
with
the
end
of
*NL*
his
crutch
,
and
with
one
hand
,
which
,
as
his
garrison
was
weak
,
was
*NL*
as
much
as
he
could
well
spare
--
but
the
disadvantages
of
such
a
*NL*
construction
were
insurmountable
;
--
for
by
this
means
,
he
would
say
,
I
*NL*
leave
one
half
of
my
bridge
in
my
enemy
's
possession
--
and
pray
of
what
*NL*
use
is
the
other
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
natural
remedy
for
this
was
,
no
doubt
,
to
have
his
bridge
fast
only
*NL*
at
one
end
with
hinges
,
so
that
the
whole
might
be
lifted
up
together
,
*NL*
and
stand
bolt
upright
--
but
that
was
rejected
for
the
reason
given
*NL*
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
whole
week
after
he
was
determined
in
his
mind
to
have
one
of
*NL*
that
particular
construction
which
is
made
to
draw
back
horizontally
,
*NL*
to
hinder
a
passage
;
and
to
thrust
forwards
again
to
gain
a
passage
--
of
*NL*
which
sorts
your
worship
might
have
seen
three
famous
ones
at
Spires
*NL*
before
its
destruction
--
and
one
now
at
Brisac
,
if
I
mistake
not
;
--
but
my
*NL*
father
advising
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
great
earnestness
,
to
have
nothing
*NL*
more
to
do
with
thrusting
bridges
--
and
my
uncle
foreseeing
moreover
*NL*
that
it
would
but
perpetuate
the
memory
of
the
Corporal
's
misfortune
--
he
*NL*
changed
his
mind
for
that
of
the
marquis
d'Hopital
's
invention
,
which
*NL*
the
younger
Bernouilli
has
so
well
and
learnedly
described
,

watch

well
as
a

of

as
the
construction
of
them
was
a

line
approximating
to
a

cycloid
--
if
not
a
cycloid
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
understood
the
nature
of
a
parabola
as
well
as
any
man
*NL*
in
England
--
but
was
not
quite
such
a
master
of
the
cycloid
;

he
talked
*NL*
however
about
it
every
day

When

told

that
Dr.
Slop
was
in

kitchen
,
*NL*
and
busy
in
making
a
bridge
--
my

Toby
--
the
affair
of
the
jack-boots
*NL*
having
just
then
raised
a
train
of
military
ideas
in
his
brain

took
it
*NL*
instantly
for
granted
that
Dr.
Slop
was
making
a
model
of
the
marquis
*NL*
d'Hopital
's
bridge

't
is
very

Toby
;

give

tell

him
heartily

peeping

it
could
not
have
given
him
a
more

distinct
conception
of

what

From

I

my

of

and
my

has
a
cloud
insensibly
*NL*
been
gathering
over
my

A
tide
of
little
evils

distresses
*NL*
has
been
setting
in
against
him
.

Not

at

that
*NL*
ever
the

dropp

a

for

The
palm
of
his
right

he
fell
upon

bed

receiving
his
forehead

and
covering
the
greatest
*NL*
part
of
both
his
eyes
,
gently
sunk
down
with
his
head
-LRB-
his
elbow
giving
*NL*
way
backwards
-RRB-
till
his
nose
touch
'd
the

his
left
arm
hung
*NL*
insensible
over

side

bed

his
knuckles
reclining
upon
the
*NL*
handle
of
the
chamber-pot

which
peep

out
beyond
the
valance

his
*NL*
right
leg
-LRB-
his
left
being
drawn
up
towards
his
body

hung
half
over
the
*NL*
side
of
the
bed

the
edge
of
it
pressing
upon
his
shin
bone

He
felt
*NL*
it
not
.
A
fix
'd
,
inflexible
sorrow
took
possession
of
every
line
of
his
*NL*
face

He
sigh

heaved
his
breast
often

uttered
not

An
old

so
that
you
see

*NL*
there
is
but
a
mark
between
these
two
,
as
fine
almost
as
a

for

comforter
to
take
aim
at

my

Toby
was
always
either
on

side

on
that
of
it

would
often
say

he
believed
in

he
could
*NL*
as
soon
hit
the
longitude

for
this
reason
,
when
he
sat
down
in

he
drew
the
curtain
a

having
a
tear
at

every

he
pull

all
--
that
it
laid
him
open
to
some
of
the
oddest
and
most
whimsical
*NL*
distresses
;
of
which
this
particular
one
,
which
he
sunk
under
at
*NL*
present
,
is
as
strong
an
example
as
can
be
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
,
the
breaking
down
of
the
bridge
of
a
child
's
nose
,
by
the
edge
*NL*
of
a
pair
of
forceps
--
however
scientifically
applied
--
would
vex
any
*NL*
man
in
the
world
,
who
was
at
so
much
pains
in
begetting
a
child
,
as
*NL*
my
father
was
--
yet
it
will
not
account
for
the
extravagance
of
his
*NL*
affliction
,
nor
will
it
justify
the
un-christian
manner
he
abandoned
and
*NL*
surrendered
himself
up
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
explain
this
,
I
must
leave
him
upon
the
bed
for
half
an
hour
--
and
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
in
his
old
fringed
chair
sitting
beside
him

*NL*
*NL*
--
I
think
it
a
very
unreasonable
demand
--
cried
my
great-grandfather
,
*NL*
twisting
up
the
paper
,
and
throwing
it
upon
the
table
.
--
By
this
account
,
*NL*
madam
,
you
have
but
two
thousand
pounds
fortune
,
and
not
a
shilling
*NL*
more
--
and
you
insist
upon
having
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
jointure
*NL*
for
it
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
`
Because
,
'
replied
my
great-grandmother
,
`
you
have
little
or
no
nose
,
*NL*
Sir
.
'
--
*NL*
*NL*
Now
before
I
venture
to
make
use
of
the
word
Nose
a
second
time
--
to
*NL*
avoid
all
confusion
in
what
will
be
said
upon
it
,
in
this
interesting
*NL*
part
of
my
story
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
explain
my
own
meaning
,
*NL*
and
define
,
with
all
possible
exactness
and
precision
,
what
I
would
*NL*
willingly
be
understood
to
mean
by
the
term
:
being
of
opinion
,
that
't
is
*NL*
owing
to
the
negligence
and
perverseness
of
writers
in
despising
this
*NL*
precaution
,
and
to
nothing
else
--
that
all
the
polemical
writings
in
*NL*
divinity
are
not
as
clear
and
demonstrative
as
those
upon
a
Will
o
'
the
*NL*
Wisp
,
or
any
other
sound
part
of
philosophy
,
and
natural
pursuit
;
in
*NL*
order
to
which
,
what
have
you
to
do
,
before
you
set
out
,
unless
you
*NL*
intend
to
go
puzzling
on
to
the
day
of
judgment
--
but
to
give
the
world
*NL*
a
good
definition
,
and
stand
to
it
,
of
the
main
word
you
have
most
*NL*
occasion
for
--
changing
it
,
Sir
,
as
you
would
a
guinea
,
into
small
*NL*
coin
?
--
which
done
--
let
the
father
of
confusion
puzzle
you
,
if
he
can
;
or
*NL*
put
a
different
idea
either
into
your
head
,
or
your
reader
's
head
,
if
he
*NL*
knows
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
books
of
strict
morality
and
close
reasoning
,
such
as
I
am
engaged
*NL*
in
--
the
neglect
is
inexcusable
;
and
Heaven
is
witness
,
how
the
world
*NL*
has
revenged
itself
upon
me
for
leaving
so
many
openings
to
equivocal
*NL*
strictures
--
and
for
depending
so
much
as
I
have
done
,
all
along
,
upon
*NL*
the
cleanliness
of
my
readers
imaginations
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
are
two
senses
,
cried
Eugenius
,
as
we
walk
'd
along
,
pointing
*NL*
with
the
fore
finger
of
his
right
hand
to
the
word
Crevice
,
in
the
one
*NL*
hundred
and
seventy-eighth
page
of
the
first
volume
of
this
book
of
*NL*
books
,
--
here
are
two
senses
--
quoth
he
.
--
And
here
are
two
roads
,
replied
*NL*
I
,
turning
short
upon
him
--
a
dirty
and
a
clean
one
--
which
shall
we
*NL*
take
?
--
The
clean
,
by
all
means
,
replied
Eugenius
.
Eugenius
,
said
I
,
*NL*
stepping
before
him
,
and
laying
my
hand
upon
his
breast
--
to
define
--
is
*NL*
to
distrust
.
--
Thus
I
triumph
'd
over
Eugenius
;
but
I
triumph
'd
over
him
*NL*
as
I
always
do
,
like
a
fool
.
--
'T
is
my
comfort
,
however
,
I
am
not
an
*NL*
obstinate
one
:
therefore
*NL*
*NL*
I
define
a
nose
as
follows
--
intreating
only
beforehand
,
and
beseeching
*NL*
my
readers
,
both
male
and
female
,
of
what
age
,
complexion
,
and
condition
*NL*
soever
,
for
the
love
of
God
and
their
own
souls
,
to
guard
against
the
*NL*
temptations
and
suggestions
of
the
devil
,
and
suffer
him
by
no
art
or
*NL*
wile
to
put
any
other
ideas
into
their
minds
,
than
what
I
put
into
my
*NL*
definition
--
For
by
the
word
Nose
,
throughout
all
this
long
chapter
of
*NL*
noses
,
and
in
every
other
part
of
my
work
,
where
the
word
Nose
occurs
--
I
*NL*
declare
,
by
that
word
I
mean
a
nose
,
and
nothing
more
,
or
less
.

*NL*
--
`
Because
,
'
quoth
my
great
grandmother
,
repeating
the
words
again
--
`
you
*NL*
have
little
or
no
nose
,
Sir
.
'
--
*NL*
*NL*
S'death
!
cried
my
great-grandfather
,
clapping
his
hand
upon
his
*NL*
nose
,
--
't
is
not
so
small
as
that
comes
to
;
--
't
is
a
full
inch
longer
than
*NL*
my
father
's
.
--
Now
,
my
great-grandfather
's
nose
was
for
all
the
world
*NL*
like
unto
the
noses
of
all
the
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
whom
Pantagruel
*NL*
found
dwelling
upon
the
island
of
Ennasin
.
--
By
the
way
,
if
you
*NL*
would
know
the
strange
way
of
getting
a-kin
amongst
so
flat-nosed
a
*NL*
people
--
you
must
read
the
book
;
--
find
it
out
yourself
,
you
never
can
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
was
shaped
,
Sir
,
like
an
ace
of
clubs
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
a
full
inch
,
continued
my
grandfather
,
pressing
up
the
ridge
of
*NL*
his
nose
with
his
finger
and
thumb
;
and
repeating
his
assertion
--
't
is
a
*NL*
full
inch
longer
,
madam
,
than
my
father
's
--
You
must
mean
your
uncle
's
,
*NL*
replied
my
great-grandmother
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
great-grandfather
was
convinced
.
--
He
untwisted
the
paper
,
and
*NL*
signed
the
article
.

Chapter

.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
an
unconscionable
jointure
,
my
dear
,
do
we
pay
out
of
this
small
*NL*
estate
of
ours
,
quoth
my
grandmother
to
my
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
replied
my
grandfather
,
had
no
more
nose
,
my
dear
,
saving
the
*NL*
mark
,
than
there
is
upon
the
back
of
my
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
,
you
must
know
,
that
my
great-grandmother
outlived
my
grandfather
*NL*
twelve
years
;
so
that
my
father
had
the
jointure
to
pay
,
a
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
pounds
half-yearly
--
-LRB-
on
Michaelmas
and
Lady-day
,
-RRB-
--
during
all
that
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
man
discharged
pecuniary
obligations
with
a
better
grace
than
my
*NL*
father
.
--
And
as
far
as
a
hundred
pounds
went
,
he
would
fling
it
upon
the
*NL*
table
,
guinea
by
guinea
,
with
that
spirited
jerk
of
an
honest
welcome
,
*NL*
which
generous
souls
,
and
generous
souls
only
,
are
able
to
fling
down
*NL*
money
:
but
as
soon
as
ever
he
enter
'd
upon
the
odd
fifty
--
he
generally
*NL*
gave
a
loud
Hem
!
rubb
'd
the
side
of
his
nose
leisurely
with
the
flat
*NL*
part
of
his
fore
finger
--
inserted
his
hand
cautiously
betwixt
his
head
*NL*
and
the
cawl
of
his
wig
--
look
'd
at
both
sides
of
every
guinea
as
he
*NL*
parted
with
it
--
and
seldom
could
get
to
the
end
of
the
fifty
pounds
,
*NL*
without
pulling
out
his
handkerchief
,
and
wiping
his
temples
.
*NL*
*NL*
Defend
me
,
gracious
Heaven
!
from
those
persecuting
spirits
who
make
no
*NL*
allowances
for
these
workings
within
us
.
--
Never
--
O
never
may
I
lay
down
*NL*
in
their
tents
,
who
can
not
relax
the
engine
,
and
feel
pity
for
the
*NL*
force
of
education
,
and
the
prevalence
of
opinions
long
derived
from
*NL*
ancestors
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
three
generations
at
least
this
tenet
in
favour
of
long
noses
had
*NL*
gradually
been
taking
root
in
our
family
.
--
Tradition
was
all
along
on
*NL*
its
side
,
and
Interest
was
every
half-year
stepping
in
to
strengthen
it
;
*NL*
so
that
the
whimsicality
of
my
father
's
brain
was
far
from
having
*NL*
the
whole
honour
of
this
,
as
it
had
of
almost
all
his
other
strange
*NL*
notions
.
--
For
in
a
great
measure
he
might
be
said
to
have
suck
'd
this
in
*NL*
with
his
mother
's
milk
.
He
did
his
part
however
.
--
If
education
planted
*NL*
the
mistake
-LRB-
in
case
it
was
one
-RRB-
my
father
watered
it
,
and
ripened
it
to
*NL*
perfection
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
often
declare
,
in
speaking
his
thoughts
upon
the
subject
,
that
*NL*
he
did
not
conceive
how
the
greatest
family
in
England
could
stand
*NL*
it
out
against
an
uninterrupted
succession
of
six
or
seven
short
*NL*
noses
.
--
And
for
the
contrary
reason
,
he
would
generally
add
,
That
it
*NL*
must
be
one
of
the
greatest
problems
in
civil
life
,
where
the
same
*NL*
number
of
long
and
jolly
noses
,
following
one
another
in
a
direct
*NL*
line
,
did
not
raise
and
hoist
it
up
into
the
best
vacancies
in
the
*NL*
kingdom
.
--
He
would
often
boast
that
the
Shandy
family
rank
'd
very
*NL*
high
in
king
Harry
the
VIIIth
's
time
,
but
owed
its
rise
to
no
state
*NL*
engine
--
he
would
say
--
but
to
that
only
;
--
but
that
,
like
other
families
,
*NL*
he
would
add
--
it
had
felt
the
turn
of
the
wheel
,
and
had
never
recovered
*NL*
the
blow
of
my
great-grandfather
's
nose
.
--
It
was
an
ace
of
clubs
indeed
,
*NL*
he
would
cry
,
shaking
his
head
--
and
as
vile
a
one
for
an
unfortunate
*NL*
family
as
ever
turn
'd
up
trumps
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Fair
and
softly
,
gentle
reader
!
--
where
is
thy
fancy
carrying
thee
!
--
If
*NL*
there
is
truth
in
man
,
by
my
great-grandfather
's
nose
,
I
mean
the
*NL*
external
organ
of
smelling
,
or
that
part
of
man
which
stands
*NL*
prominent
in
his
face
--
and
which
painters
say
,
in
good
jolly
noses
*NL*
and
well-proportioned
faces
,
should
comprehend
a
full
third
--
that
is
,
*NL*
measured
downwards
from
the
setting
on
of
the
hair
.

It
is
a
singular
blessing
,
that
nature
has
form
'd
the
mind
of
man
with
*NL*
the
same
happy
backwardness
and
renitency
against
conviction
,
which
is
*NL*
observed
in
old
dogs

`
of

What
a
shuttlecock

would
the

that

be
whisk

,
did
he
read
such
books

observe
*NL*
such

and
think
such

as
would

*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
my
father
,
as
I
told
you
last
year
,
detested
all
this
--
He
pick
'd
*NL*
up
an
opinion
,
Sir
,
as
a
man
in
a
state
of
nature
picks
up
an
apple
.
--
It
*NL*
becomes
his
own
--
and
if
he
is
a
man
of
spirit
,
he
would
lose
his
life
*NL*
rather
than
give
it
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
aware
that
Didius
,
the
great
civilian
,
will
contest
this
point
;
*NL*
and
cry
out
against
me
,
Whence
comes
this
man
's
right
to
this
apple
?
ex
*NL*
confesso
,
he
will
say
--
things
were
in
a
state
of
nature
--
The
apple
,
is
*NL*
as
much
Frank
's
apple
as
John
's
.
Pray
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
what
patent
has
he
*NL*
to
shew
for
it
?
and
how
did
it
begin
to
be
his
?
was
it
,
when
he
set
his
*NL*
heart
upon
it
?
or
when
he
gathered
it
?
or
when
he
chew
'd
it
?
or
when
he
*NL*
roasted
it
?
or
when
he
peel
'd
,
or
when
he
brought
it
home
?
or
when
he
*NL*
digested
?
--
or
when
he
--
?
--
For
't
is
plain
,
Sir
,
if
the
first
picking
up
*NL*
of
the
apple
,
made
it
not
his
--
that
no
subsequent
act
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brother
Didius
,
Tribonius
will
answer
--
-LRB-
now
Tribonius
the
civilian
and
*NL*
church
lawyer
's
beard
being
three
inches
and
a
half
and
three
eighths
*NL*
longer
than
Didius
his
beard
--
I
'm
glad
he
takes
up
the
cudgels
for
me
,
*NL*
so
I
give
myself
no
farther
trouble
about
the
answer
.
-RRB-
--
Brother
Didius
,
*NL*
Tribonius
will
say
,
it
is
a
decreed
case
,
as
you
may
find
it
in
the
*NL*
fragments
of
Gregorius
and
Hermogines
's
codes
,
and
in
all
the
codes
from
*NL*
Justinian
's
down
to
the
codes
of
Louis
and
Des
Eaux
--
That
the
sweat
of
a
*NL*
man
's
brows
,
and
the
exsudations
of
a
man
's
brains
,
are
as
much
a
man
's
*NL*
own
property
as
the
breeches
upon
his
backside
;
--
which
said
exsudations
,
*NL*
&
c.
being
dropp
'd
upon
the
said
apple
by
the
labour
of
finding
it
,
*NL*
and
picking
it
up
;
and
being
moreover
indissolubly
wasted
,
and
as
*NL*
indissolubly
annex
'd
,
by
the
picker
up
,
to
the
thing
pick
'd
up
,
carried
*NL*
home
,
roasted
,
peel
'd
,
eaten
,
digested
,
and
so
on
;
--
't
is
evident
that
*NL*
the
gatherer
of
the
apple
,
in
so
doing
,
has
mix
'd
up
something
which
*NL*
was
his
own
,
with
the
apple
which
was
not
his
own
,
by
which
means
he
has
*NL*
acquired
a
property
;
--
or
,
in
other
words
,
the
apple
is
John
's
apple
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
same
learned
chain
of
reasoning
my
father
stood
up
for
all
his
*NL*
opinions
;
he
had
spared
no
pains
in
picking
them
up
,
and
the
more
they
*NL*
lay
out
of
the
common
way
,
the
better
still
was
his
title
.
--
No
mortal
*NL*
claimed
them
;
they
had
cost
him
moreover
as
much
labour
in
cooking
and
*NL*
digesting
as
in
the
case
above
,
so
that
they
might
well
and
truly
be
*NL*
said
to
be
of
his
own
goods
and
chattels
.
--
Accordingly
he
held
fast
by
*NL*
'em
,
both
by
teeth
and
claws
--
would
fly
to
whatever
he
could
lay
his
*NL*
hands
on
--
and
,
in
a
word
,
would
intrench
and
fortify
them
round
with
*NL*
as
many
circumvallations
and
breast-works
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
would
a
*NL*
citadel
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
plaguy
rub
in
the
way
of
this
--
the
scarcity
of
materials
*NL*
to
make
any
thing
of
a
defence
with
,
in
case
of
a
smart
attack
;
inasmuch
*NL*
as
few
men
of
great
genius
had
exercised
their
parts
in
writing
books
*NL*
upon
the
subject
of
great
noses
:
by
the
trotting
of
my
lean
horse
,
the
*NL*
thing
is
incredible
!
and
I
am
quite
lost
in
my
understanding
,
when
I
am
*NL*
considering
what
a
treasure
of
precious
time
and
talents
together
has
*NL*
been
wasted
upon
worse
subjects
--
and
how
many
millions
of
books
in
all
*NL*
languages
and
in
all
possible
types
and
bindings
,
have
been
fabricated
*NL*
upon
points
not
half
so
much
tending
to
the
unity
and
peace-making
of
*NL*
the
world
.
What
was
to
be
had
,
however
,
he
set
the
greater
store
by
;
*NL*
and
though
my
father
would
oft-times
sport
with
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
library
--
which
,
by-the-bye
,
was
ridiculous
enough
--
yet
at
the
very
same
*NL*
time
he
did
it
,
he
collected
every
book
and
treatise
which
had
been
*NL*
systematically
wrote
upon
noses
,
with
as
much
care
as
my
honest
uncle
*NL*
Toby
had
done
those
upon
military
architecture
.
--
'T
is
true
,
a
much
less
*NL*
table
would
have
held
them
--
but
that
was
not
thy
transgression
,
my
dear
*NL*
uncle
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Here
--
but
why
here
--
rather
than
in
any
other
part
of
my
story
--
I
am
not
*NL*
able
to
tell
:
--
but
here
it
is
--
my
heart
stops
me
to
pay
to
thee
,
my
dear
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
once
for
all
,
the
tribute
I
owe
thy
goodness
.
--
Here
let
*NL*
me
thrust
my
chair
aside
,
and
kneel
down
upon
the
ground
,
whilst
I
am
*NL*
pouring
forth
the
warmest
sentiment
of
love
for
thee
,
and
veneration
for
*NL*
the
excellency
of
thy
character
,
that
ever
virtue
and
nature
kindled
*NL*
in
a
nephew
's
bosom
.
--
Peace
and
comfort
rest
for
evermore
upon
*NL*
thy
head
!
--
Thou
enviedst
no
man
's
comforts
--
insultedst
no

opinions
--
Thou
blackenedst
no

devouredst
no

gently
,
with
faithful
Trim
behind
thee
,
didst
thou
amble
*NL*
round
the
little
circle
of
thy
pleasures
,
jostling
no
creature
in
thy
*NL*
way
:
--
for
each
one
's
sorrows
,
thou
hadst
a
tear
,
--
for
each
man
's
need
,
*NL*
thou
hadst
a

Whilst

am
worth

to
pay

thy

from

My
father
's
collection
was
not
great
,
but
to
make
amends
,
it
was
*NL*
curious
;
and
consequently
he
was
some
time
in
making
it
;
he
had
the
*NL*
great
good
fortune
hewever
,
to
set
off
well
,
in
getting
Bruscambille
's
*NL*
prologue
upon
long
noses
,
almost
for
nothing
--
for
he
gave
no
more
for
*NL*
Bruscambille
than
three
half-crowns
;
owing
indeed
to
the
strong
fancy
*NL*
which
the
stall-man
saw
my
father
had
for
the
book
the
moment
he
*NL*
laid
his
hands
upon
it
.
--
There
are
not
three
Bruscambilles
in
*NL*
Christendom
--
said
the
stall-man
,
except
what
are
chain
'd
up
in
the
*NL*
libraries
of
the
curious
.
My
father
flung
down
the
money
as
quick
as
*NL*
lightning
--
took
Bruscambille
into
his
bosom
--
hied
home
from
Piccadilly
*NL*
to
Coleman-street
with
it
,
as
he
would
have
hied
home
with
a
treasure
,
*NL*
without
taking
his
hand
once
off
from
Bruscambille
all
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
those
who
do
not
yet
know
of
which
gender
Bruscambille
is
--
inasmuch
*NL*
as
a
prologue
upon
long
noses
might
easily
be
done
by
either
--
`
twill
be
*NL*
no
objection
against
the
simile
--
to
say
,
That
when
my
father
got
home
,
*NL*
he
solaced
himself
with
Bruscambille
after
the
manner
in
which
,
't
is
ten
*NL*
to
one
,
your
worship
solaced
yourself
with
your
first
mistress
--
that
is
,
*NL*
from
morning
even
unto
night
:
which
,
by-the-bye
,
how
delightful
soever
*NL*
it
may
prove
to
the
inamorato
--
is
of
little
or
no
entertainment
at
*NL*
all
to
by-standers
.
--
Take
notice
,
I
go
no
farther
with
the
simile
--
my
*NL*
father
's
eye
was
greater
than
his
appetite
--
his
zeal
greater
than
his
*NL*
knowledge
--
he
cool
'd
--
his
affections
became
divided
--
he
got
hold
*NL*
of
Prignitz

purchased
Scroderus

Andrea

Of

my

was
at
the
pains
to
procure
and
study
in
*NL*
support
of
his
hypothesis
,
there
was
not
any
one
wherein
he
felt
a
more
*NL*
cruel
disappointment
at
first
,
than
in
the
celebrated
dialogue
between
*NL*
Pamphagus
and
Cocles
,
written
by
the
chaste
pen
of
the
great
and
*NL*
venerable
Erasmus
,
upon
the
various
uses
and
seasonable
applications
of
*NL*
long

Now

rising

astride

break

The
doctrine
,
you
see
,
was
laid
down
by
Erasmus
,
as
my
father
wished
*NL*
it
,
with
the
utmost
plainness
;
but
my
father
's
disappointment
was
,
*NL*
in
finding
nothing
more
from
so
able
a
pen
,
but
the
bare
fact
*NL*
itself
;
without
any
of
that
speculative
subtilty
or
ambidexterity
of
*NL*
argumentation
upon
it
,
which
Heaven
had
bestow
'd
upon
man
on
purpose
to
*NL*
investigate
truth
,
and
fight
for
her
on
all
sides

My

pish

and
*NL*
pugh
'd
at

most
terribly
--
't
is
worth
something
to
have
a
good
name
.
*NL*
As
the
dialogue
was
of
Erasmus
,
my
father
soon
came
to
himself
,
and
read
*NL*
it
over
and
over
again
with
great
application
,
studying
every
word
and
*NL*
every
syllable
of
it
thro
'
and
thro
'
in
its
most
strict
and
literal
*NL*
interpretation
--
he
could
still
make
nothing
of
it
,
that
way
.
Mayhap
*NL*
there
is
more
meant
,
than
is
said
in
it
,
quoth
my
father
.
--
Learned

*NL*

Toby
,
do
n't
write
dialogues
upon
long
noses

'll

Now
I
find
it

to
inform

,
that
*NL*
besides
the
many
nautical
uses
of
long
noses
enumerated
by
Erasmus
,
*NL*
the
dialogist
affirmeth
that
a
long
nose
is
not
without
its
domestic
*NL*
conveniences
also
;
for
that
in
a
case
of
distress
--
and
for
want
of
a
*NL*
pair
of
bellows
,
it
will
do
excellently

Nature
had
been
prodigal

had
sown

seeds

verbal
criticism
as
deep
within
him
,
as
she
*NL*
had
done
the
seeds
of
all
other
knowledge
--
so
that
he
had
got
out
his
*NL*
penknife
,
and
was
trying
experiments
upon
the
sentence
,
to
see
if
he
*NL*
could
not
scratch
some
better

into
it

scratching
on

snapping

conjectures

Slawkenbergius
was
play

*NL*
of

of

it

had
been
practising
upon

all
reasoning
upon

needless

For
in

Slawkenbergius

the

of

writing

spending
so
many
years

one
work

towards
the
end

his
prolegomena

which
*NL*
by-the-bye
should
have
come
first

but
the
bookbinder
has
most
*NL*
injudiciously
placed
it
betwixt
the
analytical
contents
of
the
book
,
and
*NL*
the
book
itself
--
he
informs
his
reader

that
ever

had
arrived
*NL*

able

cooly

not
a
little
prolix
in
this
*NL*
passage
--
ever
since
I
understood
,
quoth
Slawkenbergius
,
any
thing
--
or
*NL*
rather
what
was
what
--
and
could
perceive
that
the
point
of
long
noses
*NL*
had
been
too
loosely
handled
by
all
who
had
gone
before
;
--
have
I
*NL*
Slawkenbergius
,
felt
a
strong
impulse
,
with
a
mighty
and
unresistible
*NL*
call
within
me
,
to
gird
up
myself
to
this
undertaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
to
do
justice
to
Slawkenbergius
,
he
has
entered
the
list
with
a
*NL*
stronger
lance
,
and
taken
a
much
larger
career
in
it
than
any
one
*NL*
man
who
had
ever
entered
it
before
him
--
and
indeed
,
in
many
respects
,
*NL*
deserves
to
be
en-nich
'd
as
a
prototype
for
all
writers
,
of
voluminous
*NL*
works
at
least
,
to
model
their
books
by
--
for
he
has
taken
in
,
Sir
,
the
*NL*
whole
subject
--
examined
every
part
of
it
dialectically
--
then
brought
*NL*
it
into
full
day
;
dilucidating
it
with
all
the
light
which
either
the
*NL*
collision
of
his
own
natural
parts
could
strike
--
or
the
profoundest
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
sciences
had
impowered
him
to
cast
upon
it
--
collating
,
*NL*
collecting
,
and
compiling
--
begging
,
borrowing
,
and
stealing
,
as
he
went
*NL*
along
,
all
that
had
been
wrote
or
wrangled
thereupon
in
the
schools
and
*NL*
porticos
of
the
learned
:
so
that
Slawkenbergius
his
book
may
properly
be
*NL*
considered
,
not
only
as
a
model
--
but
as
a
thorough-stitched
Digest
and
*NL*
regular
institute
of
noses
,
comprehending
in
it
all
that
is
or
can
be
*NL*
needful
to
be
known
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
cause
it
is
that
I
forbear
to
speak
of
so
many
-LRB-
otherwise
-RRB-
*NL*
valuable
books
and
treatises
of
my
father
's
collecting
,
wrote
either
,
*NL*
plump
upon
noses
--
or
collaterally
touching
them
;
--
such
for
instance
*NL*
as
Prignitz
,
now
lying
upon
the
table
before
me
,
who
with
infinite
*NL*
learning
,
and
from
the
most
candid
and
scholar-like
examination
of
above
*NL*
four
thousand
different
skulls
,
in
upwards
of
twenty
charnel-houses
in
*NL*
Silesia
,
which
he
had
rummaged
--
has
informed
us
,
that
the
mensuration
*NL*
and
configuration
of
the
osseous
or
bony
parts
of
human
noses
,
in
any
*NL*
given
tract
of
country
,
except
Crim
Tartary
,
where
they
are
all
crush
'd
*NL*
down
by
the
thumb
,
so
that
no
judgment
can
be
formed
upon
them
--
are
*NL*
much
nearer
alike
,
than
the
world
imagines
;
--
the
difference
amongst
them
*NL*
being
,
he
says
,
a
mere
trifle
,
not
worth
taking
notice
of
;
--
but
that
the
*NL*
size
and
jollity
of
every
individual
nose
,
and
by
which
one
nose
ranks
*NL*
above
another
,
and
bears
a
higher
price
,
is
owing
to
the
cartilaginous
*NL*
and
muscular
parts
of
it
,
into
whose
ducts
and
sinuses
the
blood
and
*NL*
animal
spirits
being
impell
'd
and
driven
by
the
warmth
and
force
of
the
*NL*
imagination
,
which
is
but
a
step
from
it
-LRB-
bating
the
case
of
idiots
,
*NL*
whom
Prignitz
,
who
had
lived
many
years
in
Turky
,
supposes
under
the
*NL*
more
immediate
tutelage
of
Heaven
-RRB-
--
it
so
happens
,
and
ever
must
,
says
*NL*
Prignitz
,
that
the
excellency
of
the
nose
is
in
a
direct
arithmetical
*NL*
proportion
to
the
excellency
of
the
wearer
's
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
for
the
same
reason
,
that
is
,
because
't
is
all
comprehended
in
*NL*
Slawkenbergius
,
that
I
say
nothing
likewise
of
Scroderus
-LRB-
Andrea
-RRB-
*NL*
who
,
all
the
world
knows
,
set
himself
to
oppugn
Prignitz
with
great
*NL*
violence
--
proving
it
in
his
own
way
,
first
logically
,
and
then
by
a
*NL*
series
of
stubborn
facts
,
`
That
so
far
was
Prignitz
from
the
truth
,
in
*NL*
affirming
that
the
fancy
begat
the
nose
,
that
on
the
contrary
--
the
nose
*NL*
begat
the
fancy
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
learned
suspected
Scroderus
of
an
indecent
sophism
in
this
--
and
*NL*
Prignitz
cried
out
aloud
in
the
dispute
,
that
Scroderus
had
shifted
the
*NL*
idea
upon
him
--
but
Scroderus
went
on
,
maintaining
his
thesis
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
was
just
balancing
within
himself
,
which
of
the
two
sides
he
*NL*
should
take
in
this
affair
;
when
Ambrose
Paraeus
decided
it
in
a
moment
,
*NL*
and
by
overthrowing
the
systems
,
both
of
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
,
drove
*NL*
my
father
out
of
both
sides
of
the
controversy
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
witness
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
acquaint
the
learned
reader
--
in
saying
it
,
I
mention
it
only
to
*NL*
shew
the
learned
,
I
know
the
fact
myself
--
*NL*
*NL*
That
this
Ambrose
Paraeus
was
chief
surgeon
and
nose-mender
to
Francis
*NL*
the
ninth
of
France
,
and
in
high
credit
with
him
and
the
two
preceding
,
*NL*
or
succeeding
kings
-LRB-
I
know
not
which
-RRB-
--
and
that
,
except
in
the
slip
he
*NL*
made
in
his
story
of
Taliacotius
's
noses
,
and
his
manner
of
setting
them
*NL*
on
--
he
was
esteemed
by
the
whole
college
of
physicians
at
that
time
,
as
*NL*
more
knowing
in
matters
of
noses
,
than
any
one
who
had
ever
taken
them
*NL*
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Ambrose
Paraeus
convinced
my
father
,
that
the
true
and
efficient
*NL*
cause
of
what
had
engaged
so
much
the
attention
of
the
world
,
and
*NL*
upon
which
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
had
wasted
so
much
learning
and
fine
*NL*
parts
--
was
neither
this
nor
that
--
but
that
the
length
and
goodness
of
*NL*
the
nose
was
owing
simply
to
the
softness
and
flaccidity
in
the
nurse
's
*NL*
breast
--
as
the
flatness
and
shortness
of
puisne
noses
was
to
the
*NL*
firmness
and
elastic
repulsion
of
the
same
organ
of
nutrition
in
the
*NL*
hale
and
lively
--
which
,
tho
'
happy
for
the
woman
,
was
the
undoing
of
the
*NL*
child
,
inasmuch
as
his
nose
was
so
snubb
'd
,
so
rebuff
'd
,
so
rebated
,
*NL*
and
so
refrigerated
thereby
,
as
never
to
arrive
ad
mensuram
suam
*NL*
legitimam
;
--
but
that
in
case
of
the
flaccidity
and
softness
of
the
nurse
*NL*
or
mother
's
breast
--
by
sinking
into
it
,
quoth
Paraeus
,
as
into
so
*NL*
much
butter
,
the
nose
was
comforted
,
nourish
'd
,
plump
'd
up
,
refresh
'd
,
*NL*
refocillated
,
and
set
a
growing
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
but
two
things
to
observe
of
Paraeus
;
first
,
That
he
proves
*NL*
and
explains
all
this
with
the
utmost
chastity
and
decorum
of
*NL*
expression
:
--
for
which
may
his
soul
for
ever
rest
in
peace
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
secondly
,
that
besides
the
systems
of
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
,
which
*NL*
Ambrose
Paraeus
his
hypothesis
effectually
overthrew
--
it
overthrew
at
*NL*
the
same
time
the
system
of
peace
and
harmony
of
our
family
;
and
for
*NL*
three
days
together
,
not
only
embroiled
matters
between
my
father
and
*NL*
my
mother
,
but
turn
'd
likewise
the
whole
house
and
every
thing
in
it
,
*NL*
except
my
uncle
Toby
,
quite
upside
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
ridiculous
tale
of
a
dispute
between
a
man
and
his
wife
,
*NL*
never
surely
in
any
age
or
country
got
vent
through
the
key-hole
of
a
*NL*
street-door
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
,
you
must
know
--
but
I
have
fifty
things
more
necessary
to
let
*NL*
you
know
first
--
I
have
a
hundred
difficulties
which
I
have
promised
to
*NL*
clear
up
,
and
a
thousand
distresses
and
domestick
misadventures
crowding
*NL*
in
upon
me
thick
and
threefold
,
one
upon
the
neck
of
another
.
A
cow
*NL*
broke
in
-LRB-
tomorrow
morning
-RRB-
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
fortifications
,
and
eat
*NL*
up
two
rations
and
a
half
of
dried
grass
,
tearing
up
the
sods
with
it
,
*NL*
which
faced
his
horn-work
and
covered
way
.
--
Trim
insists
upon
*NL*
being
tried
by
a
court-martial
--
the
cow
to
be
shot
--
Slop
to
be
*NL*
crucifix
'd
--
myself
to
be
tristram
'd
and
at
my
very
baptism
made
a
martyr
*NL*
of
;
--
poor
unhappy
devils
that
we
all
are
!
--
I
want
swaddling
--
but
there
*NL*
is
no
time
to
be
lost
in
exclamations
--
I
have
left
my
father
lying
*NL*
across
his
bed
,
and
my
uncle
Toby
in
his
old
fringed
chair
,
sitting
*NL*
beside
him
,
and
promised
I
would
go
back
to
them
in
half
an
hour
;
and
*NL*
five-and-thirty
minutes
are
laps
'd
already
.
--
Of
all
the
perplexities
a
*NL*
mortal
author
was
ever
seen
in
--
this
certainly
is
the
greatest
,
for
I
*NL*
have
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
's
folio
,
Sir
,
to
finish
--
a
dialogue
between
*NL*
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
upon
the
solution
of
Prignitz
,
Scroderus
,
*NL*
Ambrose
Paraeus
,
Panocrates
,
and
Grangousier
to
relate
--
a
tale
out
of
*NL*
Slawkenbergius
to
translate
,
and
all
this
in
five
minutes
less
than
*NL*
no
time
at
all
;
--
such
a

!
--
would
to

my
enemies
only
saw
the

There
was
not
any
one
scene
more
entertaining
in
our
family
--
and
to
do
*NL*
it
justice
in
this
point
;
--
and
I
here
put
off
my
cap
and
lay
it
upon
the
*NL*
table
close
beside
my
ink-horn
,
on
purpose
to
make
my
declaration
to
the
*NL*
world
concerning
this
one
article
the
more
solemn
--
that
I
believe
in
my
*NL*
soul
-LRB-
unless
my
love
and
partiality
to
my
understanding
blinds
me
-RRB-
the
*NL*
hand
of
the
supreme
Maker
and
first
Designer
of
all
things
never
made
*NL*
or
put
a
family
together
-LRB-
in
that
period
at
least
of
it
which
I
have
*NL*
sat
down
to
write
the
story
of
-RRB-
--
where
the
characters
of
it
were
cast
or
*NL*
contrasted
with
so
dramatick
a
felicity
as
ours
was
,
for
this
end
;
or
in
*NL*
which
the
capacities
of
affording
such
exquisite
scenes
,
and
the
powers
*NL*
of
shifting
them
perpetually
from
morning
to
night
,
were
lodged
and
*NL*
intrusted
with
so
unlimited
a
confidence
,
as
in
the
Shandy
Family
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
any
one
of
these
was
more
diverting
,
I
say
,
in
this
whimsical
*NL*
theatre
of
ours
--
than
what
frequently
arose
out
of
this
self-same
*NL*
chapter
of
long
noses
--
especially
when
my
father
's
imagination
was
*NL*
heated
with
the
enquiry
,
and
nothing
would
serve
him
but
to
heat
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
would
give
my
father
all
possible
fair
play
in
this
*NL*
attempt
;
and
with
infinite
patience
would
sit
smoking
his
pipe
for
*NL*
whole
hours
together
,
whilst
my
father
was
practising
upon
his
head
,
*NL*
and
trying
every
accessible
avenue
to
drive
Prignitz
and
Scroderus
's
*NL*
solutions
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
they
were
above
my
uncle
Toby
's
reason
--
or
contrary
to
it
--
or
*NL*
that
his
brain
was
like
damp
timber
,
and
no
spark
could
possibly
take
*NL*
hold
--
or
that
it
was
so
full
of
saps
,
mines
,
blinds
,
curtins
,
and
such
*NL*
military
disqualifications
to
his
seeing
clearly
into
Prignitz
and
*NL*
Scroderus
's
doctrines
--
I
say
not
--
let
schoolmen
--
scullions
,
anatomists
,
*NL*
and
engineers
,
fight
for
it
among
themselves
--
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
some
misfortune
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
in
this
affair
,
that
my
father
*NL*
had
every
word
of
it
to
translate
for
the
benefit
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
and
render
out
of
Slawkenbergius
's
Latin
,
of
which
,
as
he
was
no
great
*NL*
master
,
his
translation
was
not
always
of
the
purest
--
and
generally
*NL*
least
so
where
't
was
most
wanted
.
--
This
naturally
open
'd
a
door
to
a
*NL*
second
misfortune
;
--
that
in
the
warmer
paroxysms
of
his
zeal
to
open
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
eyes
--
my
father
's
ideas
ran
on
as
much
faster
than
the
*NL*
translation
,
as
the
translation
outmoved
my
uncle
Toby
's
--
neither
the
*NL*
one
or
the
other
added
much
to
the
perspicuity
of
my
father
's
lecture

The
gift

ratiocination

making
syllogisms

I
mean
in

for
in

superior

inferior

syllogize
by

there
is
an
island
swimming
in

not
altogether
at
its

ease
-RRB-
whose
inhabitants
,
if
my
intelligence
deceives
me
not
,
are
*NL*
so
wonderfully
gifted

as
to
syllogize
after
the

fashion

oft-times
to
make
very
well
out
too

The
gift
of
doing
it

it

,
or
--
the
great
and
*NL*
principal
act
of
ratiocination
in
man
,
as
logicians
tell
us
,
is
the
*NL*
finding
out
the
agreement

disagreement
of
two
ideas
one
with
another
,
*NL*
by
the
intervention
of
a
third
-LRB-
called
the
medius
terminus
-RRB-
;
just
as
a
*NL*
man
,
as
Locke
well
observes
,
by
a
yard
,
finds
two
mens
nine-pin-alleys
*NL*
to

of

attention
he
gave
to
every
word
--
and
as
oft
as
he
took
his
pipe
from
*NL*
his
mouth
,
with
what
wonderful
seriousness
he
contemplated
the
length
of
*NL*
it
--
surveying
it
transversely
as
he
held
it
betwixt
his
finger
and
*NL*
his
thumb
--
then
fore-right
--
then
this
way
,
and
then
that
,
in
all
its
*NL*
possible
directions
and
fore-shortenings
--
he
would
have
concluded
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
had
got
hold
of
the
medius
terminus
,
and
was
syllogizing
and
*NL*
measuring
with
it
the
truth
of
each
hypothesis
of
long
noses
,
in
order
,
*NL*
as
my
father
laid
them
before
him
.
This
,
by-the-bye
,
was
more
than
my
*NL*
father
wanted
--
his
aim
in
all
the
pains
he
was
at
in
these
philosophick
*NL*
lectures
--
was
to
enable
my
uncle
Toby
not
to
discuss
--
but
comprehend
--
to
*NL*
hold
the
grains
and
scruples
of
learning
--
not
to
weigh
them
.
--
My
uncle
*NL*
Toby
,
as
you

read
in

did
neither
the
one
or
the
*NL*
other

*NL*
'T
is
a
pity
,
cried
my
father
one
winter
's
night
,
after
a
three
hours
*NL*
painful
translation
of
Slawkenbergius
--
't
is
a
pity
,
cried
my
father
,
*NL*
putting
my
mother
's
threadpaper
into
the
book
for
a
mark
,
as
he
*NL*
spoke
--
that
truth
,
brother
Toby
,
should
shut
herself
up
in
such
*NL*
impregnable
fastnesses
,
and
be
so
obstinate
as
not
to
surrender
herself
*NL*
sometimes
up
upon
the
closest
siege
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
happened
then
,
as
indeed
it
had
often
done
before
,
that
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
's
fancy
,
during
the
time
of
my
father
's
explanation
of
Prignitz
to
*NL*
him
--
having
nothing
to
stay
it
there
,
had
taken
a
short
flight
to
the
*NL*
bowling-green
;
--
his
body
might
as
well
have
taken
a
turn
there
too
--
so
*NL*
that
with
all
the
semblance
of
a
deep
school-man
intent
upon
the
medius
*NL*
terminus
--
my
uncle
Toby
was
in
fact
as
ignorant
of
the
whole
lecture
,
*NL*
and
all
its
pros
and
cons
,
as
if
my
father
had
been
translating
Hafen
*NL*
Slawkenbergius
from
the
Latin
tongue
into
the
Cherokee
.
But
the
word
*NL*
siege
,
like
a
talismanic
power
,
in
my
father
's
metaphor
,
wafting
back
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
fancy
,
quick
as
a
note
could
follow
the
touch
--
he
open
'd
*NL*
his
ears
--
and
my
father
observing
that
he
took
his
pipe
out
of
his
*NL*
mouth
,
and
shuffled
his
chair
nearer
the
table
,
as
with
a
desire
to
*NL*
profit
--
my
father
with
great
pleasure
began
his
sentence
again
--
changing
*NL*
only
the
plan
,
and
dropping
the
metaphor
of
the
siege
of
it
,
to
keep
*NL*
clear
of
some
dangers
my
father
apprehended
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
a
pity
,
said
my
father
,
that
truth
can
only
be
on
one
side
,
brother
*NL*
Toby
--
considering
what
ingenuity
these
learned
men
have
all
shewn
in
*NL*
their
solutions
of
noses
.
--
Can
noses
be
dissolved
?
replied
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
father
thrust
back
his
chair
--
rose
up
--
put
on
his
hat
--
took
four
*NL*
long
strides
to
the
door
--
jerked
it
open
--
thrust
his
head
half
way
*NL*
out
--
shut
the
door
again
--
took
no
notice
of
the
bad
hinge
--
returned
*NL*
to
the
table
--
pluck
'd
my
mother
's
thread-paper
out
of
Slawkenbergius
's
*NL*
book
--
went
hastily
to
his
bureau
--
walked
slowly
back
--
twisted
my
*NL*
mother
's
thread-paper
about
his
thumb
--
unbutton
'd
his
waistcoat
--
threw
*NL*
my
mother
's
thread-paper
into
the
fire
--
bit
her
sattin
pin-cushion
in
*NL*
two
,
fill
'd
his
mouth
with
bran
--
confounded
it
;
--
but
mark
!
--
the
oath
of
*NL*
confusion
was
levell
'd
at
my
uncle
Toby
's
brain
--
which
was
e
`
en
confused
*NL*
enough
already
--
the
curse
came
charged
only
with
the
bran
--
the
bran
,
may
*NL*
it
please
your
honours
,
was
no
more
than
powder
to
the
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
well
my
father
's
passions
lasted
not
long
;
for
so
long
as
they
*NL*
did
last
,
they
led
him
a
busy
life
o
n't
;
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
*NL*
unaccountable
problems
that
ever
I
met
with
in
my
observations
of
human
*NL*
nature
,
that
nothing
should
prove
my
father
's
mettle
so
much
,
or
make
*NL*
his
passions
go
off
so
like
gun-powder
,
as
the
unexpected
strokes
*NL*
his
science
met
with
from
the
quaint
simplicity
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
questions
.
--
Had
ten
dozen
of
hornets
stung
him
behind
in
so
many
*NL*
different
places
all
at
one
time
--
he
could
not
have
exerted
more
*NL*
mechanical
functions
in
fewer
seconds
--
or
started
half
so
much
,
as
with
*NL*
one
single
quaere
of
three
words
unseasonably
popping
in
full
upon
him
*NL*
in
his
hobby-horsical
career
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
all
one
to
my
uncle
Toby
--
he
smoked
his
pipe
on
with
unvaried
*NL*
composure
--
his
heart
never
intended
offence
to
his
brother
--
and
as
his
*NL*
head
could
seldom
find
out
where
the
sting
of
it
lay
--
he
always
gave
*NL*
my
father
the
credit
of
cooling
by
himself
.
--
He
was
five
minutes
and
*NL*
thirty-five
seconds
about
it
in
the
present
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
all
that
's
good
!
said
my
father
,
swearing
,
as
he
came
to
himself
,
and
*NL*
taking
the
oath
out
of
Ernulphus
's
digest
of
curses
--
-LRB-
though
to
do
my
*NL*
father
justice
it
was
a
fault
-LRB-
as
he
told
Dr.
Slop
in
the
affair
of
*NL*
Ernulphus
-RRB-
which
he
as
seldom
committed
as
any
man
upon
earth
-RRB-
--
By
all
*NL*
that
's
good
and
great
!
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
if
it
was
not
for
*NL*
the
aids
of
philosophy
,
which
befriend
one
so
much
as
they
do
--
you
would
*NL*
put
a
man
beside
all
temper
.
--
Why
,
by
the
solutions
of
noses
,
of
which
*NL*
I
was
telling
you
,
I
meant
,
as
you
might
have
known
,
had
you
favoured
me
*NL*
with
one
grain
of
attention
,
the
various
accounts
which
learned
men
of
*NL*
different
kinds
of
knowledge
have
given
the
world
of
the
causes
of
short
*NL*
and
long
noses
.
--
There
is
no
cause
but
one
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
--
why
*NL*
one
man
's
nose
is
longer
than
another
's
,
but
because
that
God
pleases
to
*NL*
have
it
so
.
--
That
is
Grangousier
's
solution
,
said
my
father
.
--
'T
is
*NL*
he
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
up
,
and
not
regarding
my
father
's
*NL*
interruption
,
who
makes
us
all
,
and
frames
and
puts
us
together
in
*NL*
such
forms
and
proportions
,
and
for
such
ends
,
as
is
agreeable
to
*NL*
his
infinite
wisdom
,
.
--
'T
is
a
pious
account
,
cried
my
father
,
but
not
*NL*
philosophical
--
there
is
more
religion
in
it
than
sound
science
.
'T
was
no
*NL*
inconsistent
part
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
character
--
that
he
feared
God
,
and
*NL*
reverenced
religion
.
--
So
the
moment
my
father
finished
his
remark
--
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
fell
a
whistling
Lillabullero
with
more
zeal
-LRB-
though
more
out
*NL*
of
tune
-RRB-
than
usual
.

*NL*
*NL*
No
matter
--
as
an
appendage
to
seamstressy
,
the
thread-paper
might
be
*NL*
of
some
consequence
to
my
mother
--
of
none
to
my
father
,
as
a
mark
in
*NL*
Slawkenbergius
.
Slawkenbergius
in
every
page
of
him
was
a
rich
treasure
*NL*
of
inexhaustible
knowledge
to
my
father
--
he
could
not
open
him
amiss
;
*NL*
and
he
would
often
say
in
closing
the
book
,
that
if
all
the
arts
and
*NL*
sciences
in
the
world
,
with
the
books
which
treated
of
them
,
were
*NL*
lost
--
should
the
wisdom
and
policies
of
governments
,
he
would
say
,
*NL*
through
disuse
,
ever
happen
to
be
forgot
,
and
all
that
statesmen
had
*NL*
wrote
or
caused
to
be
written
,
upon
the
strong
or
the
weak
sides
of
*NL*
courts
and
kingdoms
,
should
they
be
forgot
also
--
and
Slawkenbergius
only
*NL*
left
--
there
would
be
enough
in
him
in
all
conscience
,
he
would
say
,
*NL*
to
set
the
world
a-going
again
.
A
treasure
therefore
was
he
indeed
!
*NL*
an
institute
of
all
that
was
necessary
to
be
known
of
noses
,
and
every
*NL*
thing
else
--
at
matin
,
noon
,
and
vespers
was
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
his
*NL*
recreation
and
delight
:
't
was
for
ever
in
his
hands
--
you
would
have
*NL*
sworn
,
Sir
,
it
had
been
a
canon
's
prayer-book
--
so
worn
,
so
glazed
,
so
*NL*
contrited
and
attrited
was
it
with
fingers
and
with
thumbs
in
all
its
*NL*
parts
,
from
one
end
even
unto
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
such
a
bigot
to
Slawkenbergius
as
my
father
;
--
there
is
a
fund
*NL*
in
him
,
no
doubt
:
but
in
my
opinion
,
the
best
,
I
do
n't
say
the
most
*NL*
profitable
,
but
the
most
amusing
part
of
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
,
is
his
*NL*
tales
--
and
,
considering
he
was
a
German
,
many
of
them
told
not
without
*NL*
fancy
:
--
these
take
up
his
second
book
,
containing
nearly
one
half
of
*NL*
his
folio
,
and
are
comprehended
in
ten
decads
,
each
decad
containing
ten
*NL*
tales
--
Philosophy
is
not
built
upon
tales
;
and
therefore
't
was
certainly
*NL*
wrong
in
Slawkenbergius
to
send
them
into
the
world
by
that
name
!
--
there
*NL*
are
a
few
of
them
in
his
eighth
,
ninth
,
and
tenth
decads
,
which
I
own
*NL*
seem
rather
playful
and
sportive
,
than
speculative
--
but
in
general
they
*NL*
are
to
be
looked
upon
by
the
learned
as
a
detail
of
so
many
independent
*NL*
facts
,
all
of
them
turning
round
somehow
or
other
upon
the
main
hinges
*NL*
of
his
subject
,
and
added
to
his
work
as
so
many
illustrations
upon
the
*NL*
doctrines
of
noses
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
leisure
enough
upon
our
hands
--
if
you
give
me
leave
,
madam
,
*NL*
I
'll
tell
you
the
ninth
tale
of
his
tenth
decad
.

As
Hafen
Slawkenbergius

is

scarce
,
it
may
not
be
unacceptable
to
the
learned
reader
to
see
the
*NL*
specimen
of
a
few
pages
of
his
original
;
I
will
make
no
reflection
*NL*
upon
it
,
but
that
his
story-telling
Latin
is
much
more
concise
than
his
*NL*
philosophic
--
and
,
I
think
,
has
more
of
Latinity
in
it
.

Slawkenbergius

Tale
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
cool
refreshing
evening
,
at
the
close
of
a
very
sultry
day
,
*NL*
in
the
latter
end
of
the
month
of
August
,
when
a
stranger
,
mounted
upon
*NL*
a
dark
mule
,
with
a
small
cloak-bag
behind
him
,
containing
a
few
shirts
,
*NL*
a
pair
of
shoes
,
and
a
crimson-sattin
pair
of
breeches
,
entered
the
town
*NL*
of
Strasburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
the
centinel
,
who
questioned
him
as
he
entered
the
gates
,
that
*NL*
he
had
been
at
the
Promontory
of
Noses
--
was
going
on
to
Frankfort
--
and
*NL*
should
be
back
again
at
Strasburg
that
day
month
,
in
his
way
to
the
*NL*
borders
of
Crim
Tartary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
centinel
looked
up
into
the
stranger
's
face
--
he
never
saw
such
a
*NL*
Nose
in
his
life
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
made
a
very
good
venture
of
it
,
quoth
the
stranger
--
so
slipping
*NL*
his
wrist
out
of
the
loop
of
a
black
ribbon
,
to
which
a
short
scymetar
*NL*
was
hung
,
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
,
and
with
great
courtesy
*NL*
touching
the
fore
part
of
his
cap
with
his
left
hand
,
as
he
extended
his
*NL*
right
--
he
put
a
florin
into
the
centinel
's
hand
,
and
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
grieves
,
me
,
said
the
centinel
,
speaking
to
a
little
dwarfish
*NL*
bandy-legg
'd
drummer
,
that
so
courteous
a
soul
should
have
lost
his
*NL*
scabbard
--
he
can
not
travel
without
one
to
his
scymetar
,
and
will
not
*NL*
be
able
to
get
a
scabbard
to
fit
it
in
all
Strasburg
.
--
I
never
had
one
,
*NL*
replied
the
stranger
,
looking
back
to
the
centinel
,
and
putting
his
hand
*NL*
up
to
his
cap
as
he
spoke
--
I
carry
it
,
continued
he
,
thus
--
holding
up
*NL*
his
naked
scymetar
,
his
mule
moving
on
slowly
all
the
time
--
on
purpose
*NL*
to
defend
my
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
well
worth
it
,
gentle
stranger
,
replied
the
centinel
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
not
worth
a
single
stiver
,
said
the
bandy-legg
'd
drummer
--
't
is
a
*NL*
nose
of
parchment
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
am
a
true
catholic
--
except
that
it
is
six
times
as
big
--
't
is
a
*NL*
nose
,
said
the
centinel
,
like
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
heard
it
crackle
,
said
the
drummer
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
dunder
,
said
the
centinel
,
I
saw
it
bleed
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
pity
,
cried
the
bandy-legg
'd
drummer
,
we
did
not
both
touch
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
very
time
that
this
dispute
was
maintaining
by
the
centinel
*NL*
and
the
drummer
--
was
the
same
point
debating
betwixt
a
trumpeter
and
a
*NL*
trumpeter
's
wife
,
who
were
just
then
coming
up
,
and
had
stopped
to
see
*NL*
the
stranger
pass
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Benedicity
!
--
What
a
nose
!
't
is
as
long
,
said
the
trumpeter
's
wife
,
as
a
*NL*
trumpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
of
the
same
metal
said
the
trumpeter
,
as
you
hear
by
its
sneezing
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
as
soft
as
a
flute
,
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
brass
,
said
the
trumpeter
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
a
pudding
's
end
,
said
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
tell
thee
again
,
said
the
trumpeter
,
't
is
a
brazen
nose
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
'll
know
the
bottom
of
it
,
said
the
trumpeter
's
wife
,
for
I
will
touch
*NL*
it
with
my
finger
before
I
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
's
mule
moved
on
at
so
slow
a
rate
,
that
he
heard
every
*NL*
word
of
the
dispute
,
not
only
betwixt
the
centinel
and
the
drummer
,
but
*NL*
betwixt
the
trumpeter
and
trumpeter
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
!
said
he
,
dropping
his
reins
upon
his
mule
's
neck
,
and
laying
both
*NL*
his
hands
upon
his
breast
,
the
one
over
the
other
in
a
saint-like
*NL*
position
-LRB-
his
mule
going
on
easily
all
the
time
-RRB-
No
!
said
he
,
looking
*NL*
up
--
I
am
not
such
a
debtor
to
the
world
--
slandered
and
disappointed
as
*NL*
I
have
been
--
as
to
give
it
that
conviction
--
no
!
said
he
,
my
nose
shall
*NL*
never
be
touched
whilst
Heaven
gives
me
strength
--
To
do
what
?
said
a
*NL*
burgomaster
's
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
took
no
notice
of
the
burgomaster
's
wife
--
he
was
making
*NL*
a
vow
to
Saint
Nicolas
;
which
done
,
having
uncrossed
his
arms
with
the
*NL*
same
solemnity
with
which
he
crossed
them
,
he
took
up
the
reins
of
his
*NL*
bridle
with
his
left-hand
,
and
putting
his
right
hand
into
his
bosom
,
*NL*
with
the
scymetar
hanging
loosely
to
the
wrist
of
it
,
he
rode
on
,
as
*NL*
slowly
as
one
foot
of
the
mule
could
follow
another
,
thro
'
the
principal
*NL*
streets
of
Strasburg
,
till
chance
brought
him
to
the
great
inn
in
the
*NL*
market-place
over-against
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
the
stranger
alighted
,
he
ordered
his
mule
to
be
led
into
the
*NL*
stable
,
and
his
cloak-bag
to
be
brought
in
;
then
opening
,
and
taking
out
*NL*
of
it
his
crimson-sattin
breeches
,
with
a
silver-fringed
--
-LRB-
appendage
to
*NL*
them
,
which
I
dare
not
translate
-RRB-
--
he
put
his
breeches
,
with
his
fringed
*NL*
cod-piece
on
,
and
forth-with
,
with
his
short
scymetar
in
his
hand
,
*NL*
walked
out
to
the
grand
parade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
had
just
taken
three
turns
upon
the
parade
,
when
he
*NL*
perceived
the
trumpeter
's
wife
at
the
opposite
side
of
it
--
so
turning
*NL*
short
,
in
pain
lest
his
nose
should
be
attempted
,
he
instantly
went
back
*NL*
to
his
inn
--
undressed
himself
,
packed
up
his
crimson-sattin
breeches
,
*NL*
&
c.
in
his
cloak-bag
,
and
called
for
his
mule
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
going
forwards
,
said
the
stranger
,
for
Frankfort
--
and
shall
be
back
*NL*
at
Strasburg
this
day
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hope
,
continued
the
stranger
,
stroking
down
the
face
of
his
mule
with
*NL*
his
left
hand
as
he
was
going
to
mount
it
,
that
you
have
been
kind
*NL*
to
this
faithful
slave
of
mine
--
it
has
carried
me
and
my
cloak-bag
,
*NL*
continued
he
,
tapping
the
mule
's
back
,
above
six
hundred
leagues
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
a
long
journey
,
Sir
,
replied
the
master
of
the
inn
--
unless
a
man
*NL*
has
great
business
.
--
Tut
!
tut
!
said
the
stranger
,
I
have
been
at
the
*NL*
promontory
of
Noses
;
and
have
got
me
one
of
the
goodliest
,
thank
Heaven
,
*NL*
that
ever
fell
to
a
single
man
's
lot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
the
stranger
was
giving
this
odd
account
of
himself
,
the
master
*NL*
of
the
inn
and
his
wife
kept
both
their
eyes
fixed
full
upon
the
*NL*
stranger
's
nose
--
By
saint
Radagunda
,
said
the
inn-keeper
's
wife
to
*NL*
herself
,
there
is
more
of
it
than
in
any
dozen
of
the
largest
noses
put
*NL*
together
in
all
Strasburg
!
is
it
not
,
said
she
,
whispering
her
husband
*NL*
in
his
ear
,
is
it
not
a
noble
nose
?
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
an
imposture
,
my
dear
,
said
the
master
of
the
inn
--
't
is
a
false
*NL*
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
a
true
nose
,
said
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
made
of
fir-tree
,
said
he
,
I
smell
the
turpentine
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
There
's
a
pimple
on
it
,
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
a
dead
nose
,
replied
the
inn-keeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
a
live
nose
,
and
if
I
am
alive
myself
,
said
the
inn-keeper
's
,
wife
,
*NL*
I
will
touch
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
made
a
vow
to
saint
Nicolas
this
day
,
said
the
stranger
,
that
my
*NL*
nose
shall
not
be
touched
till
--
Here
the
stranger
suspending
his
voice
,
*NL*
looked
up
.
--
Till
when
?
said
she
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
never
shall
be
touched
,
said
he
,
clasping
his
hands
and
bringing
them
*NL*
close
to
his
breast
,
till
that
hour
--
What
hour
?
cried
the
inn
keeper
's
*NL*
wife
.
--
Never
!
--
never
!
said
the
stranger
,
never
till
I
am
got
--
For
*NL*
Heaven
's
sake
,
into
what
place
?
said
she
--
The
stranger
rode
away
without
*NL*
saying
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
had
not
got
half
a
league
on
his
way
towards
Frankfort
*NL*
before
all
the
city
of
Strasburg
was
in
an
uproar
about
his
nose
.
The
*NL*
Compline
bells
were
just
ringing
to
call
the
Strasburgers
to
their
*NL*
devotions
,
and
shut
up
the
duties
of
the
day
in
prayer
:
--
no
soul
in
all
*NL*
Strasburg
heard
'em
--
the
city
was
like
a
swarm
of
bees
--
men
,
women
,
and
*NL*
children
,
-LRB-
the
Compline
bells
tinkling
all
the
time
-RRB-
flying
here
and
*NL*
there
--
in
at
one
door
,
out
at
another
--
this
way
and
that
way
--
long
ways
*NL*
and
cross
ways
--
up
one
street
,
down
another
street
--
in
at
this
alley
,
*NL*
out
of
that
--
did
you
see
it
?
did
you
see
it
?
did
you
see
it
?
O
!
did
you
*NL*
see
it
?
--
who
saw
it
?
who
did
see
it

for
mercy
's
sake
,
who
saw
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Alack
o'day
!
I
was
at
vespers
!
--
I
was
washing
,
I
was
starching
,
I
was
*NL*
scouring
,
I
was
quilting
--
God
help
me
!
I
never
saw
it
--
I
never

*NL*
it
!
--
would
I
had
been
a
centinel
,
a
bandy-legg
'd
drummer
,
a
trumpeter
,
*NL*
a
trumpeter
's
wife
,
was
the
general
cry
and
lamentation
in
every
street
*NL*
and
corner
of
Strasburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
all
this
confusion
and
disorder
triumphed
throughout
the
great
*NL*
city
of
Strasburg
,
was
the
courteous
stranger
going
on
as
gently
upon
*NL*
his
mule
in
his
way
to
Frankfort
,
as
if
he
had
no
concern
at
all
in
the
*NL*
affair
--
talking
all
the
way
he
rode
in
broken
sentences
,
sometimes
to
*NL*
his
mule
--
sometimes
to
himself
--
sometimes
to
his
Julia
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
Julia
,
my
lovely
Julia
!
--
nay
I
can
not
stop
to
let
thee
bite
that
*NL*
thistle
--
that
ever
the
suspected
tongue
of
a
rival

The

alighted

not

taken
the

*NL*
without
reduction
of
its
bulk
,
had
that
night
been
at
the
pains
of

slitting
and
dividing
it
into

made
such

cries
Slawkenbergius
with
more
gaiety
of
*NL*
thought
than
I
could
have
expected
from
him
-RRB-
that
there
is
many
a
good
*NL*
simile
now
subsisting
in
the
world
which
might
give
my
countrymen
some
*NL*
idea
of
it
;
but
at
the
close
of
such
a
folio
as
this
,
wrote
for
their
*NL*
sakes
,
and
in
which
I
have
spent
the
greatest
part
of
my
life
--
tho
'
I
*NL*
own
to
them
the
simile
is
in
being
,
yet
would
it
not
be
unreasonable
in
*NL*
them
to
expect
I
should
have
either
time
or
inclination
to
search
for
*NL*
it
?
Let
it
suffice
to
say
,
that
the
riot
and
disorder
it
occasioned
*NL*
in
the
Strasburgers
fantasies
was
so
general
--
such
an
overpowering
*NL*
mastership
had
it
got
of
all
the
faculties
of
the
Strasburgers
minds
--
so
*NL*
many
strange
things
,
with
equal
confidence
on
all
sides
,
and
with
equal
*NL*
eloquence
in
all
places
,
were
spoken
and
sworn
to
concerning
it
,
that
*NL*
turned
the
whole
stream
of
all
discourse
and
wonder
towards
it
--
every
*NL*
soul
,
good
and
bad
--
rich
and
poor
--
learned
and
unlearned
--
doctor
and
*NL*
student
--
mistress
and
maid
--
gentle
and
simple
--
nun
's
flesh
and
woman
's
*NL*
flesh
,
in
Strasburg
spent
their
time
in
hearing
tidings
about
it
--
every
*NL*
eye
in
Strasburg
languished
to
see
it
--
every
finger
--
every
thumb
in
*NL*
Strasburg
burned
to
touch
it
.

*NL*
Now
what
might
add
,
if
any
thing
may
be
thought
necessary
to
add
,
to
*NL*
so
vehement
a
desire
--
was
this
,
that
the
centinel
,
the
bandy-legg
'd
*NL*
drummer
,
the
trumpeter
,
the
trumpeter
's
wife
,
the
burgomaster
's
widow
,
*NL*
the
master
of

,
and
the

of

wife
,
how
widely
*NL*
soever
they
all
differed
every
one
from
another
in
their
testimonies
*NL*
and
description
of
the
stranger
's
nose
--
they
all
agreed
together
in
two
*NL*
points
--
namely
,
that
he
was
gone
to
Frankfort
,
and
would
not
return
to
*NL*
Strasburg
till
that
day
month
;
and
secondly
,
whether
his
nose
was
true
*NL*
or
false
,
that
the
stranger
himself
was
one
of
the
most
perfect
paragons
*NL*
of
beauty
--
the
finest-made
man
--
the
most
genteel
!
--
the
most
generous
of
*NL*
his
purse
--
the
most
courteous
in
his
carriage
,
that
had
ever
entered
the
*NL*
gates
of
Strasburg
--
that
as
he
rode
,
with
scymetar
slung
loosely
to
his
*NL*
wrist
,
thro
'
the
streets
--
and
walked
with
his
crimson-sattin
breeches
*NL*
across
the
parade
--
't
was
with
so
sweet
an
air
of
careless
modesty
,
and
*NL*
so
manly
withal
--
as
would
have
put
the
heart
in
jeopardy
-LRB-
had
his
nose
*NL*
not
stood
in
his
way
-RRB-
of
every
virgin
who
had
cast
her
eyes
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
call
not
upon
that
heart
which
is
a
stranger
to
the
throbs
*NL*
and
yearnings
of
curiosity
,
so
excited
,
to
justify
the
abbess
of
*NL*
Quedlingberg
,
the
prioress
,
the
deaness
,
and
sub-chantress
,
for
sending
*NL*
at
noon-day
for
the
trumpeter
's
wife
:
she
went
through
the
streets
of
*NL*
Strasburg
with
her
husband
's
trumpet
in
her
hand
,
--
the
best
apparatus
*NL*
the
straitness
of
the
time
would
allow
her
,
for
the
illustration
of
her
*NL*
theory
--
she
staid
no
longer
than
three
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
centinel
and
bandy-legg
'd
drummer
!
--
nothing
on
this
side
of
old
*NL*
Athens
could
equal
them
!
they
read
their
lectures
under
the
city-gates
*NL*
to
comers
and
goers
,
with
all
the
pomp
of
a
Chrysippus
and
a
Crantor
in
*NL*
their
porticos
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
of
the
inn
,
with
his
ostler
on
his
left-hand
,
read
his
also
*NL*
in
the
same
stile
--
under
the
portico
or
gateway
of
his
stable-yard
--
his
*NL*
wife
,
hers
more
privately
in
a
back
room
:
all
flocked
to
their
lectures
;
*NL*
not
promiscuously
--
but
to
this
or
that
,
as
is
ever
the
way
,
as
faith
and
*NL*
credulity
marshal
'd
them
--
in
a
word
,
each
Strasburger
came
crouding
for
*NL*
intelligence
--
and
every
Strasburger
had
the
intelligence
he
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
worth
remarking
,
for
the
benefit
of
all
demonstrators
in
natural
*NL*
philosophy
,
&
c.
that
as
soon
as
the
trumpeter
's
wife
had
finished
the
*NL*
abbess
of
Quedlingberg
's
private
lecture
,
and
had
begun
to
read
*NL*
in
public
,
which
she
did
upon
a
stool
in
the
middle
of
the
great
*NL*
parade
,
--
she
incommoded
the
other
demonstrators
mainly
,
by
gaining
*NL*
incontinently
the
most
fashionable
part
of
the
city
of
Strasburg
for
her
*NL*
auditory
--
But
when
a
demonstrator
in
philosophy
-LRB-
cries
Slawkenbergius
-RRB-
*NL*
has
a
trumpet
for
an
apparatus
,
pray
what
rival
in
science
can
pretend
*NL*
to
be
heard
besides
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
the
unlearned
,
thro
'
these
conduits
of
intelligence
,
were
all
*NL*
busied
in
getting
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
,
where
Truth
keeps
her
*NL*
little
court
--
were
the
learned
in
their
way
as
busy
in
pumping
her
up
*NL*
thro
'
the
conduits
of
dialect
induction
--
they
concerned
themselves
not
*NL*
with
facts
--
they
reasoned
--
*NL*
*NL*
Not
one
profession
had
thrown
more
light
upon
this
subject
than
the
*NL*
Faculty
--
had
not
all
their
disputes
about
it
run
into
the
affair
of
Wens
*NL*
and
oedematous
swellings
,
they
could
not
keep
clear
of
them
for
their
*NL*
bloods
and
souls
--
the
stranger
's
nose
had
nothing
to
do
either
with
wens
*NL*
or
oedematous
swellings
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
demonstrated
however
very
satisfactorily
,
that
such
a
ponderous
*NL*
mass
of
heterogenous
matter
could
not
be
congested
and
conglomerated
*NL*
to
the
nose
,
whilst
the
infant
was
in
Utera
,
without
destroying
the
*NL*
statical
balance
of
the
foetus
,
and
throwing
it
plump
upon
its
head
nine
*NL*
months
before
the
time
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
opponents
granted
the
theory
--
they
denied
the
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
a
suitable
provision
of
veins
,
arteries
,
&
c.
said
they
,
was
*NL*
not
laid
in
,
for
the
due
nourishment
of
such
a
nose
,
in
the
very
first
*NL*
stamina
and
rudiments
of
its
formation
,
before
it
came
into
the
world
*NL*
-LRB-
bating
the
case
of
Wens
-RRB-
it
could
not
regularly
grow
and
be
sustained
*NL*
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
all
answered
by
a
dissertation
upon
nutriment
,
and
the
effect
*NL*
which
nutriment
had
in
extending
the
vessels
,
and
in
the
increase
and
*NL*
prolongation
of
the
muscular
parts
to
the
greatest
growth
and
expansion
*NL*
imaginable
--
In
the
triumph
of
which
theory
,
they
went
so
far
as
to
*NL*
affirm
,
that
there
was
no
cause
in
nature
,
why
a
nose
might
not
grow
to
*NL*
the
size
of
the
man
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
respondents
satisfied
the
world
this
event
could
never
happen
to
*NL*
them
so
long
as
a
man
had
but
one
stomach
and
one
pair
of
lungs
--
For
the
*NL*
stomach
,
said
they
,
being
the
only
organ
destined
for
the
reception
*NL*
of
food
,
and
turning
it
into
chyle
--
and
the
lungs
the
only
engine
*NL*
of
sanguification
--
it
could
possibly
work
off
no
more
,
than
what
the
*NL*
appetite
brought
it
:
or
admitting
the
possibility
of
a
man
's
overloading
*NL*
his
stomach
,
nature
had
set
bounds
however
to
his
lungs
--
the
engine
was
*NL*
of
a
determined
size
and
strength
,
and
could
elaborate
but
a
certain
*NL*
quantity
in
a
given
time
--
that
is
,
it
could
produce
just
as
much
blood
*NL*
as
was
sufficient
for
one
single
man
,
and
no
more
;
so
that
,
if
there
was
*NL*
as
much
nose
as
man
--
they
proved
a
mortification
must
necessarily
ensue
;
*NL*
and
forasmuch
as
there
could
not
be
a
support
for
both
,
that
the
nose
*NL*
must
either
fall
off
from
the
man
,
or
the
man
inevitably
fall
off
from
*NL*
his
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nature
accommodates
herself
to
these
emergencies
,
cried
the
*NL*
opponents
--
else
what
do
you
say
to
the
case
of
a
whole
stomach
--
a
*NL*
whole
pair
of
lungs
,
and
but
half
a
man
,
when
both
his
legs
have
been
*NL*
unfortunately
shot
off
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
dies
of
a
plethora
,
said
they
--
or
must
spit
blood
,
and
in
a
fortnight
*NL*
or
three
weeks
go
off
in
a
consumption
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
happens
otherwise
--
replied
the
opponents
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
It
ought
not
,
said
they
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
curious
and
intimate
inquirers
after
nature
and
her
doings
,
*NL*
though
they
went
hand
in
hand
a
good
way
together
,
yet
they
all
divided
*NL*
about
the
nose
at
last
,
almost
as
much
as
the
Faculty
itself
*NL*
*NL*
They
amicably
laid
it
down
,
that
there
was
a
just
and
geometrical
*NL*
arrangement
and
proportion
of
the
several
parts
of
the
human
frame
to
*NL*
its
several
destinations
,
offices
,
and
functions
,
which
could
not
*NL*
be
transgressed
but
within
certain
limits
--
that
nature
,
though
she
*NL*
sported
--
she
sported
within
a
certain
circle
;
--
and
they
could
not
agree
*NL*
about
the
diameter
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
logicians
stuck
much
closer
to
the
point
before
them
than
any
of
the
*NL*
classes
of
the
literati
;
--
they
began
and
ended
with
the
word
Nose
;
and
*NL*
had
it
not
been
for
a
petitio
principii
,
which
one
of
the
ablest
of
*NL*
them
ran
his
head
against
in
the
beginning
of
the
combat
,
the
whole
*NL*
controversy
had
been
settled
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
nose
,
argued
the
logician
,
can
not
bleed
without
blood
--
and
not
only
*NL*
blood
--
but
blood
circulating
in
it
to
supply
the
phaenomenon
with
a
*NL*
succession
of
drops
--
-LRB-
a
stream
being
but
a
quicker
succession
of
drops
,
*NL*
that
is
included
,
said
he
.
-RRB-
--
Now
death
,
continued
the
logician
,
being
*NL*
nothing
but
the
stagnation
of
the
blood
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
deny
the
definition
--
Death
is
the
separation
of
the
soul
from
the
*NL*
body
,
said
his
antagonist
--
Then
we
do
n't
agree
about
our
weapons
,
*NL*
said
the
logician
--
Then
there
is
an
end
of
the
dispute
,
replied
the
*NL*
antagonist
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
civilians
were
still
more
concise
:
what
they
offered
being
more
in
*NL*
the
nature
of
a
decree
--
than
a
dispute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
monstrous
nose
,
said
they
,
had
it
been
a
true
nose
,
could
not
*NL*
possibly
have
been
suffered
in
civil
society
--
and
if
false
--
to
impose
*NL*
upon
society
with
such
false
signs
and
tokens
,
was
a
still
greater
*NL*
violation
of
its
rights
,
and
must
have
had
still
less
mercy
shewn
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
objection
to
this
was
,
that
if
it
proved
any
thing
,
it
proved
*NL*
the
stranger
's
nose
was
neither
true
nor
false
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
left
room
for
the
controversy
to
go
on
.
It
was
maintained
by
the
*NL*
advocates
of
the
ecclesiastic
court
,
that
there
was
nothing
to
inhibit
a
*NL*
decree
,
since
the
stranger
ex
mero
motu
had
confessed
he
had
been
at
the
*NL*
Promontory
of
Noses
,
and
had
got
one
of
the
goodliest
,
&
c.
&
c.
--
To
this
*NL*
it
was
answered
,
it
was
impossible
there
should
be
such
a
place
as
*NL*
the
Promontory
of
Noses
,
and
the
learned
be
ignorant
where
it
lay
.
The
*NL*
commissary
of
the
bishop
of
Strasburg
undertook
the
advocates
,
explained
*NL*
this
matter
in
a
treatise
upon
proverbial
phrases
,
shewing
them
,
that
*NL*
the
Promontory
of
Noses
was
a
mere
allegorick
expression
,
importing
no
*NL*
more
than
that
nature
had
given
him
a
long
nose
:
in
proof
of
which
,
*NL*
with
great
learning
,
he
cited
the
underwritten
authorities

-RRB-
which
had
decided
the
point
incontestably
,
had
it
not
*NL*
appeared
that
a
dispute
about
some
franchises
of
dean
and
chapter-lands
*NL*
had
been
determined
by
it
nineteen
years
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
--
I
must
say
unluckily
for
Truth
,
because
they
were
giving
*NL*
her
a
lift
another
way
in
so
doing
;
that
the
two
universities
of
*NL*
Strasburg
--
the
Lutheran
,
founded
in
the
year
1538
by
Jacobus
Surmis
,
*NL*
counsellor
of
the
senate
,
--
and
the
Popish
,
founded
by
Leopold
,
arch-duke
*NL*
of
Austria
,
were
,
during
all
this
time
,
employing
the
whole
depth
*NL*
of
their
knowledge
-LRB-
except
just
what
the
affair
of
the
abbess
of
*NL*
Quedlingberg
's
placket-holes
required
-RRB-
--
in
determining
the
point
of
*NL*
Martin
Luther
's
damnation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Popish
doctors
had
undertaken
to
demonstrate
a
priori
,
that
from
the
*NL*
necessary
influence
of
the
planets
on
the
twenty-second
day
of
October
*NL*
1483
--
when
the
moon
was
in
the
twelfth
house
,
Jupiter
,
Mars
,
and
Venus
*NL*
in
the
third
,
the

Saturn

,
all
got

in
the
*NL*

--
that
he
must
in

,
be
a

man
--
and
*NL*
that
his
doctrines
,
by
a

must
be
damn

too

-RRB-
-LRB-
in
*NL*
reading
this
my
father
would
always
shake
his
head
-RRB-
in
the
ninth
house
,
*NL*
with
the
Arabians
allotted
to
religion
--
it
appeared
that
Martin
Luther
*NL*
did
not
care
one
stiver
about
the
matter
--
and
that
from
the
horoscope
*NL*
directed
to
the
conjunction
of
Mars
--
they
made
it
plain
likewise
he
must
*NL*
die
cursing
and
blaspheming
--
with
the
blast
of
which
his
soul
-LRB-
being
*NL*
steep
'd
in
guilt
-RRB-
sailed
before
the
wind
,
in
the
lake
of
hell-fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
objection
of
the
Lutheran
doctors
to
this
,
was
,
that
it
must
*NL*
certainly
be
the
soul
of
another
man
,
born
Oct.
22
,
83
.
which
was
forced
*NL*
to
sail
down
before
the
wind
in
that
manner
--
inasmuch
as
it
appeared
*NL*
from
the
register
of
Islaben
in
the
county
of
Mansfelt
,
that
Luther
was
*NL*
not
born
in
the
year
1483
,
but
in
84
;
and
not
on
the
22d
day
of
October
,
*NL*
but
on
the
10th
of
November
,
the
eve
of
Martinmas
day
,
from
whence
he
*NL*
had
the
name
of
Martin
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
--
I
must
break
off
my
translation
for
a
moment
;
for
if
I
did
not
,
I
*NL*
know
I
should
no
more
be
able
to
shut
my
eyes
in
bed
,
than
the
abbess
of
*NL*
Quedlingberg
--
It
is
to
tell
the
reader
;
that
my
father
never
read
this
*NL*
passage
of
Slawkenbergius
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
but
with
triumph
--
not
over
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
he
never
opposed
him
in
it
--
but
over
the
whole
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
you
see
,
brother
Toby
,
he
would
say
,
looking
up
,
`
that
christian
*NL*
names
are
not
such
indifferent
things
;
'
--
had
Luther
here
been
called
*NL*
by
any
other
name
but
Martin
,
he
would
have
been
damn
'd
to
all
*NL*
eternity
--
Not
that
I
look
upon
Martin
,
he
would
add
,
as
a
good
name
--
far
*NL*
from
it
--
't
is
something
better
than
a
neutral
,
and
but
a
little
--
yet
*NL*
little
as
it
is
you
see
it
was
of
some
service
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
knew
the
weakness
of
this
prop
to
his
hypothesis
,
as
well
as
*NL*
the
best
logician
could
shew
him
--
yet
so
strange
is
the
weakness
of
man
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
as
it
fell
in
his
way
,
he
could
not
for
his
life
but
*NL*
make
use
of
it
;
and
it
was
certainly
for
this
reason
,
that
though
there
*NL*
are
many
stories
in
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
's
Decades
full
as
entertaining
*NL*
as
this
I
am
translating
,
yet
there
is
not
one
amongst
them
which
*NL*
my
father
read
over
with
half
the
delight
--
it
flattered
two
of
his
*NL*
strangest
hypotheses
together
--
his
Names
and
his
Noses
.
--
I
will
be
bold
*NL*
to
say
,
he
might
have
read
all
the
books
in
the
Alexandrian
Library
,
*NL*
had
not
fate
taken
other
care
of
them
,
and
not
have
met
with
a
book
or
*NL*
passage
in
one
,
which
hit
two
such
nails
as
these
upon
the
head
at
one
*NL*
stroke
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
universities
of
Strasburg
were
hard
tugging
at
this
affair
of
*NL*
Luther
's
navigation
.
The
Protestant
doctors
had
demonstrated
,
that
*NL*
he
had
not
sailed
right
before
the
wind
,
as
the
Popish
doctors
had
*NL*
pretended
;
and
as
every
one
knew
there
was
no
sailing
full
in
the
teeth
*NL*
of
it
--
they
were
going
to
settle
,
in
case
he
had
sailed
,
how
many
points
*NL*
he
was
off
;
whether
Martin
had
doubled
the
cape
,
or
had
fallen
upon
a
*NL*
lee-shore
;
and
no
doubt
,
as
it
was
an
enquiry
of
much
edification
,
at
*NL*
least
to
those
who
understood
this
sort
of
Navigation
,
they
had
gone
on
*NL*
with
it
in
spite
of
the
size
of
the
stranger
's
nose
,
had
not
the
size
of
*NL*
the
stranger
's
nose
drawn
off
the
attention
of
the
world
from
what
they
*NL*
were
about
--
it
was
their
business
to
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbess
of
Quedlingberg
and
her
four
dignitaries
was
no
stop
;
for
the
*NL*
enormity
of
the
stranger
's
nose
running
full
as
much
in
their
fancies
*NL*
as
their
case
of
conscience
--
the
affair
of
their
placket-holes
*NL*
kept
cold
--
in
a
word
,
the
printers
were
ordered
to
distribute
their
*NL*
types
--
all
controversies
dropp
'd
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
a
square
cap
with
a
silver
tassel
upon
the
crown
of
it
--
to
*NL*
a
nut-shell
--
to
have
guessed
on
which
side
of
the
nose
the
two
*NL*
universities
would
split
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
above
reason
,
cried
the
doctors
on
one
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
below
reason
,
cried
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
faith
,
cried
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
a
fiddle-stick
,
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
possible
,
cried
the
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
impossible
,
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
God
's
power
is
infinite
,
cried
the
Nosarians
,
he
can
do
any
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
can
do
nothing
,
replied
the
Anti-nosarians
,
which
implies
*NL*
contradictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
can
make
matter
think
,
said
the
Nosarians
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
certainly
as
you
can
make
a
velvet
cap
out
of
a
sow
's
ear
,
replied
*NL*
the
Anti-nosarians
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
can
not
make
two
and
two
five
,
replied
the
Popish
doctors
.
--
'T
is
*NL*
false
,
said
their
other
opponents
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Infinite
power
is
infinite
power
,
said
the
doctors
who
maintained
the
*NL*
reality
of
the
nose
.
--
It
extends
only
to
all
possible
things
,
replied
*NL*
the
Lutherans
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
God
in
heaven
,
cried
the
Popish
doctors
,
he
can
make
a
nose
,
if
he
*NL*
thinks
fit
,
as
big
as
the
steeple
of
Strasburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
steeple
of
Strasburg
being
the
biggest
and
the
tallest
*NL*
church-steeple
to
be
seen
in
the
whole
world
,
the
Anti-nosarians
denied
*NL*
that
a
nose
of
575
geometrical
feet
in
length
could
be
worn
,
at
least
*NL*
by
a
middle-siz
'd
man
--
The
Popish
doctors
swore
it
could
--
The
Lutheran
*NL*
doctors
said
No
;
--
it
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
at
once
started
a
new
dispute
,
which
they
pursued
a
great
way
,
*NL*
upon
the
extent
and
limitation
of
the
moral
and
natural
attributes
of
*NL*
God
--
That
controversy
led
them
naturally
into
Thomas
Aquinas
,
and
Thomas
*NL*
Aquinas
to
the
devil
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
's
nose
was
no
more
heard
of
in
the
dispute
--
it
just
served
*NL*
as
a
frigate
to
launch
them
into
the
gulph
of
school-divinity
--
and
then
*NL*
they
all
sailed
before
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heat
is
in
proportion
to
the
want
of
true
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
controversy
about
the
attributes
,
&
c.
instead
of
cooling
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
had
inflamed
the
Strasburgers
imaginations
to
a
most
inordinate
*NL*
degree
--
The
less
they
understood
of
the
matter
the
greater
was
their
*NL*
wonder
about
it
--
they
were
left
in
all
the
distresses
of
desire
*NL*
unsatisfied
--
saw
their
doctors
,
the
Parchmentarians
,
the
Brassarians
,
*NL*
the
Turpentarians
,
on
one
side
--
the
Popish
doctors
on
the
other
,
like
*NL*
Pantagruel
and
his
companions
in
quest
of
the
oracle
of
the
bottle
,
all
*NL*
embarked
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
poor
Strasburgers
left
upon
the
beach
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
was
to
be
done
?
--
No
delay
--
the
uproar
increased
--
every
one
in
*NL*
disorder
--
the
city
gates
set
open
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunate
Strasbergers
!
was
there
in
the
store-house
of
nature
--
was
*NL*
there
in
the
lumber-rooms
of
learning
--
was
there
in
the
great
arsenal
*NL*
of
chance
,
one
single
engine
left
undrawn
forth
to
torture
your
*NL*
curiosities
,
and
stretch
your
desires
,
which
was
not
pointed
by
the
*NL*
hand
of
Fate
to
play
upon
your
hearts
?
--
I
dip
not
my
pen
into
my
ink
to
*NL*
excuse
the
surrender
of
yourselves
--
't
is
to
write
your
panegyrick
.
Shew
*NL*
me
a
city
so
macerated
with
expectation
--
who
neither
eat
,
or
drank
,
*NL*
or
slept
,
or
prayed
,
or
hearkened
to
the
calls
either
of
religion
or
*NL*
nature
,
for
seven-and-twenty
days
together
,
who
could
have
held
out
one
*NL*
day
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
twenty-eighth
the
courteous
stranger
had
promised
to
return
to
*NL*
Strasburg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
thousand
coaches
-LRB-
Slawkenbergius
must
certainly
have
made
some
*NL*
mistake
in
his
numeral
characters
-RRB-
7000
coaches
--
15000
single-horse
*NL*
chairs
--
20000
waggons
,
crowded
as
full
as
they
could
all
hold
with
*NL*
senators
,
counsellors
,
syndicks
--
beguines
,
widows
,
wives
,
virgins
,
*NL*
canons
,
concubines
,
all
in
their
coaches
--
The
abbess
of
Quedlingberg
,
*NL*
with
the
prioress
,
the
deaness
and
sub-chantress
,
leading
the
procession
*NL*
in
one
coach
,
and
the
dean
of
Strasburg
,
with
the
four
great
dignitaries
*NL*
of
his
chapter
,
on
her
left-hand
--
the
rest
following
higglety-pigglety
*NL*
as
they
could
;
some
on
horseback
--
some
on

--
some
led
--
some
*NL*
driven
--
some
down
the
Rhine
--
some
this
way
--
some
that
--
all
set
out
at
*NL*
sun-rise
to
meet
the
courteous
stranger
on
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Haste
we
now
towards
the
catastrophe
of
my
tale
--
I
say
Catastrophe
*NL*
-LRB-
cries
Slawkenbergius
-RRB-
inasmuch
as
a
tale
,
with
parts
rightly
disposed
,
*NL*
not
only
rejoiceth
-LRB-
gaudet
-RRB-
in
the
Catastrophe
and
Peripeitia
of
a
*NL*
Drama
,
but
rejoiceth
moreover
in
all
the
essential
and
integrant
parts
*NL*
of
it
--
it
has
its
Protasis
,
Epitasis
,
Catastasis
,
its
Catastrophe
or
*NL*
Peripeitia
growing
one
out
of
the
other
in
it
,
in
the
order
Aristotle
*NL*
first
planted
them
--
without
which
a
tale
had
better
never
be
told
at
*NL*
all
,
says
Slawkenbergius
,
but
be
kept
to
a
man
's
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
my
ten
tales
,
in
all
my
ten
decades
,
have
I
Slawkenbergius
tied
*NL*
down
every
tale
of
them
as
tightly
to
this
rule
,
as
I
have
done
this
of
*NL*
the
stranger
and
his
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
From
his
first
parley
with
the
centinel
,
to
his
leaving
the
city
of
*NL*
Strasburg
,
after
pulling
off
his
crimson-sattin
pair
of
breeches
,
is
*NL*
the
Protasis
or
first
entrance
--
where
the
characters
of
the
Personae
*NL*
Dramatis
are
just
touched
in
,
and
the
subject
slightly
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Epitasis
,
wherein
the
action
is
more
fully
entered
upon
and
*NL*
heightened
,
till
it
arrives
at
its
state
or
height
called
the
*NL*
Catastasis
,
and
which
usually
takes
up
the
2d
and
3d
act
,
is
included
*NL*
within
that
busy
period
of
my
tale
,
betwixt
the
first
night
's
uproar
*NL*
about
the
nose
,
to
the
conclusion
of
the
trumpeter
's
wife
's
lectures
*NL*
upon
it
in
the
middle
of
the
grand
parade
:
and
from
the
first
embarking
*NL*
of
the
learned
in
the
dispute
--
to
the
doctors
finally
sailing
away
,
and
*NL*
leaving
the
Strasburgers
upon
the
beach
in
distress
,
is
the
Catastasis
*NL*
or
the
ripening
of
the
incidents
and
passions
for
their
bursting
forth
*NL*
in
the
fifth
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
commences
with
the
setting
out
of
the
Strasburgers
in
the
Frankfort
*NL*
road
,
and
terminates
in
unwinding
the
labyrinth
and
bringing
the
hero
*NL*
out
of
a
state
of
agitation
-LRB-
as
Aristotle
calls
it
-RRB-
to
a
state
of
rest
*NL*
and
quietness
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
says
Hafen
Slawkenbergius
,
constitutes
the
Catastrophe
or
*NL*
Peripeitia
of
my
tale
--
and
that
is
the
part
of
it
I
am
going
to
relate
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
left
the
stranger
behind
the
curtain
asleep
--
he
enters
now
upon
the
*NL*
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
dost
thou
prick
up
thy
ears
at
?
--
't
is
nothing
but
a
man
upon
a
*NL*
horse
--
was
the
last
word
the
stranger
uttered
to
his
mule
.
It
was
not
*NL*
proper
then
to
tell
the
reader
,
that
the
mule
took
his
master
's
word
for
*NL*
it
;
and
without
any
more
ifs
or
ands
,
let
the
traveller
and
his
horse
*NL*
pass
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
was
hastening
with
all
diligence
to
get
to
Strasburg
that
*NL*
night
.
What
a
fool
am
I
,
said
the
traveller
to
himself
,
when
he
had
*NL*
rode
about
a
league
farther
,
to
think
of
getting
into
Strasburg
this
*NL*
night
.
--
Strasburg
!
--
the
great
Strasburg
!
--
Strasburg
,
the
capital
of
*NL*
all
Alsatia
!
Strasburg
,
an
imperial
city
!
Strasburg
,
a
sovereign
state
!
*NL*
Strasburg
,
garrisoned
with
five
thousand
of
the
best
troops
in
all
the
*NL*
world
!
--
Alas
!
if
I
was
at
the
gates
of
Strasburg
this
moment
,
I
could
*NL*
not
gain
admittance
into
it
for
a
ducat
--
nay
a
ducat
and
half
--
't
is
too
*NL*
much
--
better
go
back
to
the
last
inn
I
have
passed
--
than
lie
I
know
*NL*
not
where
--
or
give
I
know
not
what
.
The
traveller
,
as
he
made
these
*NL*
reflections
in
his
mind
,
turned
his
horse
's
head
about
,
and
three
*NL*
minutes
after
the
stranger
had
been
conducted
into
his
chamber
,
he
*NL*
arrived
at
the
same
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
have
bacon
in
the
house
,
said
the
host
,
and
bread
--
and
till
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
this
night
had
three
eggs
in
it
--
but
a
stranger
,
who
arrived
an
*NL*
hour
ago
,
has
had
them
dressed
into
an
omelet
,
and
we
have
nothing
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
said
the
traveller
,
harassed
as
I
am
,
I
want
nothing
but
a
bed
.
--
I
*NL*
have
one
as
soft
as
is
in
Alsatia
,
said
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
stranger
,
continued
he
,
should
have
slept
in
it
,
for
't
is
my
best
*NL*
bed
,
but
upon
the
score
of
his
nose
.
--
He
has
got
a
defluxion
,
said
the
*NL*
traveller
.
--
Not
that
I
know
,
cried
the
host
.
--
But
't
is
a
camp-bed
,
and
*NL*
Jacinta
,
said
he
,
looking
towards
the
maid
,
imagined
there
was
not
*NL*
room
in
it
to
turn
his
nose
in
.
--
Why
so
?
cried
the
traveller
,
starting
*NL*
back
.
--
It
is
so
long
a
nose
,
replied
the
host
.
--
The
traveller
fixed
*NL*
his
eyes
upon
Jacinta
,
then
upon
the
ground
--
kneeled
upon
his
right
*NL*
knee
--
had
just
got
his
hand
laid
upon
his
breast
--
Trifle
not
with
my
*NL*
anxiety
,
said
he
rising
up
again
.
--
'T
is
no
trifle
,
said
Jacinta
,
't
is
*NL*
the
most
glorious
nose
!
--
The
traveller
fell
upon
his
knee
again
--
laid
*NL*
his
hand
upon
his
breast
--
then
,
said
he
,
looking
up
to
heaven
,
thou
hast
*NL*
conducted
me
to
the
end
of
my
pilgrimage
--
'T
is
Diego
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
was
the
brother
of
the
Julia
,
so
often
invoked
that
night
*NL*
by
the
stranger
as
he
rode
from
Strasburg
upon
his
mule
;
and
was
*NL*
come
,
on
her
part
,
in
quest
of
him
.
He
had
accompanied
his
sister
from
*NL*
Valadolid
across
the
Pyrenean
mountains
through
France
,
and
had
many
an
*NL*
entangled
skein
to
wind
off
in
pursuit
of
him
through
the
many
meanders
*NL*
and
abrupt
turnings
of
a
lover
's
thorny
tracks
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Julia
had
sunk
under
it
--
and
had
not
been
able
to
go
a
step
farther
*NL*
than
to
Lyons
,
where
,
with
the
many
disquietudes
of
a
tender
heart
,
*NL*
which
all
talk
of
--
but
few
feel
--
she
sicken
'd
,
but
had
just
strength
to
*NL*
write
a
letter
to
Diego
;
and
having
conjured
her
brother
never
to
see
*NL*
her
face
till
he
had
found
him
out
,
and
put
the
letter
into
his
hands
,
*NL*
Julia
took
to
her
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fernandez
-LRB-
for
that
was
her
brother
's
name
-RRB-
--
tho
'
the
camp-bed
was
as
*NL*
soft
as
any
one
in
Alsace
,
yet
he
could
not
shut
his
eyes
in
it
.
--
As
*NL*
soon
as
it
was
day
he
rose
,
and
hearing
Diego
was
risen
too
,
he
entered
*NL*
his
chamber
,
and
discharged
his
sister
's
commission
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
Seig
.
Diego
,
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whether
my
suspicions
of
your
nose
were
justly
excited
or
not
--
't
is
*NL*
not
now
to
inquire
--
it
is
enough
I
have
not
had
firmness
to
put
them
to
*NL*
farther
tryal
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
could
I
know
so
little
of
myself
,
when
I
sent
my
Duenna
to
forbid
*NL*
your
coming
more
under
my
lattice
?
or
how
could
I
know
so
little
of
you
,
*NL*
Diego
,
as
to
imagine
you
would
not
have
staid
one
day
in
Valadolid
to
*NL*
have
given
ease
to
my
doubts
?
--
Was
I
to
be
abandoned
,
Diego
,
because
*NL*
I
was
deceived
?
or
was
it
kind
to
take
me
at
my
word
,
whether
my
*NL*
suspicions
were
just
or
no
,
and
leave
me
,
as
you
did
,
a
prey
to
much
*NL*
uncertainty
and
sorrow
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
what
manner
Julia
has
resented
this
--
my
brother
,
when
he
puts
this
*NL*
letter
into
your
hands
,
will
tell
you
;
He
will
tell
you
in
how
few
*NL*
moments
she
repented
of
the
rash
message
she
had
sent
you
--
in
what
*NL*
frantic
haste
she
flew
to
her
lattice
,
and
how
many
days
and
nights
*NL*
together
she
leaned
immoveably
upon
her
elbow
,
looking
through
it
*NL*
towards
the
way
which
Diego
was
wont
to
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
will
tell
you
,
when
she
heard
of
your
departure
--
how
her
spirits
*NL*
deserted
her
--
how
her
heart
sicken
'd
--
how
piteously
she
mourned
--
how
low
*NL*
she
hung
her
head
.
O
Diego
!
how
many
weary
steps
has
my
brother
's
pity
*NL*
led
me
by
the
hand
languishing
to
trace
out
yours
;
how
far
has
desire
*NL*
carried
me
beyond
strength
--
and
how
oft
have
I
fainted
by
the
way
,
and
*NL*
sunk
into
his
arms
,
with
only
power
to
cry
out
--
O
my
Diego
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
the
gentleness
of
your
carriage
has
not
belied
your
heart
,
you
will
*NL*
fly
to
me
,
almost
as
fast
as
you
fled
from
me
--
haste
as
you
will
--
you
*NL*
will
arrive
but
to
see
me
expire
.
--
'T
is
a
bitter
draught
,
Diego
,
but
oh
!
*NL*
't
is
embittered
still
more
by
dying
un

--
'
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
proceed
no
farther
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slawkenbergius
supposes
the
word
intended
was
unconvinced
,
but
her
*NL*
strength
would
not
enable
her
to
finish
her
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heart
of
the
courteous
Diego
over-flowed
as
he
read
the
letter
--
he
*NL*
ordered
his
mule
forthwith
and
Fernandez
's
horse
to
be
saddled
;
and
as
*NL*
no
vent
in
prose
is
equal
to
that
of
poetry
in
such
conflicts
--
chance
,
*NL*
which
as
often
directs
us
to
remedies
as
to
diseases
,
having
thrown
*NL*
a
piece
of
charcoal
into
the
window
--
Diego
availed
himself
of
it
,
and
*NL*
whilst
the
hostler
was
getting
ready
his
mule
,
he
eased
his
mind
against
*NL*
the
wall
as
follows
.

*NL*
*NL*
Ode

*NL*
*NL*
Harsh
and
untuneful
are
the
notes
of
love
,
*NL*
Unless
my
Julia
strikes
the
key
,
*NL*
Her
hand
alone
can
touch
the
part
,
*NL*
Whose
dulcet
movement
charms
the
heart
,

And
governs
all
the
man
with
sympathetick
sway

O
Julia

The
lines
were
very
natural

they
were
nothing
at

the

purpose

Slawkenbergius
,
and
't
is
a
pity
there
were
no
more
*NL*
of
them
;
but
whether
it
was
that
Seig
.
Diego
was
slow
in
composing
*NL*
verses
--
or
the
hostler
quick
in
saddling
mules
--
is
not
averred
;
certain
*NL*
it
was
,
that
Diego
's
mule
and
Fernandez
's
horse
were
ready
at
the
door
*NL*
of
the
inn
,
before
Diego
was
ready
for
his
second
stanza
;
so
without
*NL*
staying
to
finish
his
ode
,
they
both
mounted
,
sallied
forth
,
passed
the
*NL*
Rhine
,
traversed
Alsace
,
shaped
their
course
towards
Lyons
,
and
before
*NL*
the
Strasburgers
and
the
abbess
of
Quedlingberg
had
set
out
on
their
*NL*
cavalcade
,
had
Fernandez
,
Diego
,
and
his
Julia
,
crossed
the
Pyrenean
*NL*
mountains
,
and
got
safe
to
Valadolid
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
needless
to
inform
the
geographical
reader
,
that
when
Diego
was
*NL*
in
Spain
,
it
was
not
possible
to
meet
the
courteous
stranger
in
the
*NL*
Frankfort
road
;
it
is
enough
to
say
,
that
of
all
restless
desires
,
*NL*
curiosity
being
the
strongest
--
the
Strasburgers
felt
the
full
force
of
*NL*
it
;
and
that
for
three
days
and
nights
they
were
tossed
to
and
fro
in
*NL*
the
Frankfort
road
,
with
the
tempestuous
fury
of
this
passion
,
before
*NL*
they
could
submit
to
return
home
.
--
When
alas
!
an
event
was
prepared
for
*NL*
them
,
of
all
other
,
the
most
grievous
that
could
befal
a
free
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
revolution
of
the
Strasburgers
affairs
is
often
spoken
of
,
and
*NL*
little
understood
,
I
will
,
in
ten
words
,
says
Slawkenbergius
,
give
the
*NL*
world
an
explanation
of
it
,
and
with
it
put
an
end
to
my
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
body
knows
of
the
grand
system
of
Universal
Monarchy
,
wrote
by
*NL*
order
of
Mons
.
Colbert
,
and
put
in
manuscript
into
the
hands
of
Lewis
*NL*
the
fourteenth
,
in
the
year
1664
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
as
well
known
,
that
one
branch
out
of
many
of
that
system
,
was
the
*NL*
getting
possession
of
Strasburg
,
to
favour
an
entrance
at
all
times
*NL*
into
Suabia
,
in
order
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
Germany
--
and
that
in
*NL*
consequence
of
this
plan
,
Strasburg
unhappily
fell
at
length
into
their
*NL*
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
lot
of
a
few
to
trace
out
the
true
springs
of
this
and
such
*NL*
like
revolutions
--
The
vulgar
look
too
high
for
them
--
Statesmen
look
too
*NL*
low
--
Truth
-LRB-
for
once
-RRB-
lies
in
the
middle
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
fatal
thing
is
the
popular
pride
of
a
free
city
!
cries
one
*NL*
historian
--
The
Strasburgers
deemed
it
a
diminution
of
their
freedom
to
*NL*
receive
an
imperial
garrison
--
so
fell
a
prey
to
a
French
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fate
,
says
another
,
of
the
Strasburgers
,
may
be
a
warning
to
*NL*
all
free
people
to
save
their
money
.
--
They
anticipated
their
*NL*
revenues
--
brought
themselves
under
taxes
,
exhausted
their
strength
,
and
*NL*
in
the
end
became
so
weak
a
people
,
they
had
not
strength
to
keep
their
*NL*
gates
shut
,
and
so
the
French
pushed
them
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
alas
!
cries
Slawkenbergius
,
't
was
not
the
French
,
--
't
was
Curiosity
*NL*
pushed
them
open
--
The
French
indeed
,
who
are
ever
upon
the
catch
,
when
*NL*
they
saw
the
Strasburgers
,
men
,
women
and
children
,
all
marched
out
to
*NL*
follow
the
stranger
's
nose
--
each
man
followed
his
own
,
and
marched
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Trade
and
manufactures
have
decayed
and
gradually
grown
down
ever
*NL*
since
--
but
not
from
any
cause
which
commercial
heads
have
assigned
;
for
*NL*
it
is
owing
to
this
only
,
that
Noses
have
ever
so
run
in
their
heads
,
*NL*
that
the
Strasburgers
could
not
follow
their
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
alas
!
cries
Slawkenbergius
,
making
an
exclamation
--
it
is
not
the
*NL*
first
--
and
I
fear
will
not
be
the
last
fortress
that
has
been
either
*NL*
won

or
lost
by
Noses

With
all
this
learning
upon
Noses
running
perpetually
in
my
father
's
*NL*
fancy
--
with
so
many
family
prejudices

and
ten
decades
of
such
tales

running
on
for
ever
along
with

how
was
it
possible
with
such

exquisite

was
it
a
true
nose
?

That
a
man
with
such
exquisite
feelings
*NL*
as
my
father
had
,
could
bear
the
shock
at
all
below
stairs
--
or
indeed
*NL*
above
stairs
,
in
any
other
posture
,
but
the
very
posture
I
have
*NL*
described
?

Throw
yourself
down
upon

a
dozen
times

taking
care
only
to
*NL*
place
a
looking-glass
first
in
a
chair
on
one
side
of
it
,
before
you
do
*NL*
it
--
But
was
the
stranger
's
nose
a
true
nose
,
or
was
it
a
false
one
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
tell
that
before-hand
,
madam
,
would
be
to
do
injury
to
one
of
the
*NL*
best
tales
in
the
Christian-world
;
and
that
is
the
tenth
of
the
tenth
*NL*
decade
,
which
immediately
follows
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
tale
,
cried
Slawkenbergius
,
somewhat
exultingly
,
has
been
reserved
*NL*
by
me
for
the
concluding
tale
of
my
whole
work
;
knowing
right
well
,
*NL*
that
when
I
shall
have
told
it
,
and
my
reader
shall
have
read
it
*NL*
thro

--
`
twould
be
even
high
time
for
both
of
us
to
shut
up
the
book
;
*NL*
inasmuch
,
continues
Slawkenbergius
,
as
I
know
of
no
tale
which
could
*NL*
possibly
ever
go
down
after
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
a
tale
indeed
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
sets
out
with
the
first
interview
in
the
inn
at
Lyons
,
when
*NL*
Fernandez
left
the
courteous
stranger
and
his
sister
Julia
alone
in
her
*NL*
chamber
,
and
is
over-written

Intricacies

*NL*
*NL*
Heavens
!
thou
art
a
strange
creature
,
Slawkenbergius
!
what
a
whimsical
*NL*
view
of
the
involutions
of
the
heart
of
woman
hast
thou
opened
!
how
this
*NL*
can
ever
be
translated
,
and
yet
if
this
specimen
of
Slawkenbergius
's
*NL*
tales
,
and
the
exquisitiveness
of
his
moral
,
should
please
the
*NL*
world
--
translated
shall
a
couple
of
volumes
be
.
--
Else
,
how
this
can
ever
*NL*
be
translated
into
good
English
,
I
have
no
sort
of
conception
--
There
*NL*
seems
in
some
passages
to
want
a
sixth
sense
to
do
it
rightly
.
--
What
can
*NL*
he
mean
by
the
lambent
pupilability
of
slow
,
low
,
dry
chat
,
five
notes
*NL*
below
the
natural
tone
--
which
you
know
,
madam
,
is
little
more
than
a
*NL*
whisper
?
The
moment
I
pronounced
the
words
,
I
could
perceive
an
attempt
*NL*
towards
a
vibration
in
the
strings
,
about
the
region
of
the
heart
.
--
The
*NL*
brain
made
no
acknowledgment
.
--
There
's
often
no
good
understanding
*NL*
betwixt
'em
--
I
felt
as
if
I
understood
it
.
--
I
had
no
ideas
.
--
The
*NL*
movement
could
not
be
without
cause
.
--
I
'm
lost
.
I
can
make
nothing
of
*NL*
it
--
unless
,
may
it
please
your
worships
,
the
voice
,
in
that
case
being
*NL*
little
more
than
a
whisper
,
unavoidably
forces
the
eyes
to
approach
not
*NL*
only
within
six
inches
of
each
other
--
but
to
look
into
the
pupils
--
is
*NL*
not
that
dangerous
?
--
But
it
ca
n't
be
avoided
--
for
to
look
up
to
the
*NL*
cieling
,
in
that
case
the
two
chins
unavoidably
meet
--
and
to
look
down
*NL*
into
each
other
's
lap
,
the
foreheads
come
to
immediate
contact
,
which
*NL*
at
once
puts
an
end
to
the
conference
--
I
mean
to
the
sentimental
part
of
*NL*
it
.

What
is
left

,
is
not
worth
stooping
for

My
father
lay
stretched
across
the
bed
as
still
as
if
the
hand
of
death
*NL*
had
pushed
him
down
,
for
a
full
hour
and
a
half
before
he
began
to
play
*NL*
upon
the
floor
with
the
toe
of
that
foot
which
hung
over
the
bed-side
;
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
heart
was
a
pound
lighter
for
it
.
--
In
a
few
moments
,
*NL*
his
left-hand
,
the
knuckles
of
which
had
all
the
time
reclined
upon
the
*NL*
handle
of
the
chamber-pot
,
came
to
its
feeling
--
he
thrust
it
a
little
*NL*
more
within
the
valance
--
drew
up
his
hand
,
when
he
had
done
,
into
his
*NL*
bosom
--
gave
a
hem
!
My
good
uncle
Toby
,
with
infinite
pleasure
,
answered
*NL*
it
;
and
full
gladly
would
have
ingrafted
a
sentence
of
consolation
upon
*NL*
the
opening
it
afforded
:
but
having
no
talents
,
as
I
said
,
that
way
,
and
*NL*
fearing
moreover
that
he
might
set
out
with
something
which
might
make
*NL*
a
bad
matter
worse
,
he
contented
himself
with
resting
his
chin
placidly
*NL*
upon
the
cross
of
his
crutch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
whether
the
compression
shortened
my
uncle
Toby
's
face
into
a
more
*NL*
pleasurable
oval
--
or
that
the
philanthropy
of
his
heart
,
in
seeing
*NL*
his
brother
beginning
to
emerge
out
of
the
sea
of
his
afflictions
,
*NL*
had
braced
up
his
muscles
--
so
that
the
compression
upon
his
chin
only
*NL*
doubled
the
benignity
which
was
there
before
,
is
not
hard
to
decide
.

My
*NL*
father
,
in
turning
his
eyes
,
was
struck
with
such
a
gleam
of
sun-shine
*NL*
in
his
face
,
as
melted
down
the
sullenness
of
his
grief
in
a
moment

broke
silence

I
never

may

continued
Trim

a
tear
stealing
into
the
corner
of
his
eye
as
*NL*
he
spoke
--
to
think
of
two
virtuous

as
warm

as
honest
as
God
could

going
forth
with
gallant
spirits
to
seek
their

poor

to

tortured

nothing

marrying

sold

down

that

goodness

I

thy

is

worth

Trim

*NL*
Trim
attempted
to
thank
my
uncle
Toby
--
but
had
not
power
--
tears
trickled
*NL*
down
his
cheeks
faster
than
he
could
wipe
them
off
--
He
laid
his

*NL*
upon

made
a
bow
to
the

shut

When
my
uncle
Toby
first
mentioned
the
grenadier
,
my
father
,
I
said
,
*NL*
fell
down
with
his
nose
flat
to
the
quilt
,
and
as
suddenly
as
if
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
had
shot
him
;
but
it
was
not
added
that
every
other
limb
*NL*
and
member
of
my
father
instantly
relapsed
with
his
nose
into
the
same
*NL*
precise
attitude
in
which
he
lay
first
described
;
so
that
when
corporal
*NL*
Trim
left
the
room
,
and
my
father
found
himself
disposed
to
rise
off
*NL*
the
bed
--
he
had
all
the
little
preparatory
movements
to
run
over
again
,
*NL*
before
he
could
do
it
.
Attitudes
are
nothing
,
madam
--
't
is
the
transition
*NL*
from
one
attitude
to
another
--
like
the
preparation
and
resolution
of
the
*NL*
discord
into
harmony
,
which
is
all
in
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
which
reason
my
father
played
the
same
jig
over
again
with
his
toe
*NL*
upon
the
floor
--
pushed
the
chamber-pot
still
a
little
farther
within
*NL*
the
valance
--
gave
a
hem
--
raised
himself
up
upon
his
elbow
--
and
was
just
*NL*
beginning
to
address
himself
to
my
uncle
Toby
--
when
recollecting
the
*NL*
unsuccessfulness
of
his
first
effort
in
that
attitude
--
he
got
upon
his
*NL*
legs
,
and
in
making
the
third
turn
across
the
room
,
he
stopped
short
*NL*
before
my
uncle
Toby
;
and
laying
the
three
first
fingers
of
his
*NL*
right-hand
in
the
palm
of
his
left
,
and
stooping
a
little
,
he
addressed
*NL*
himself
to
my
uncle
Toby
as

When
I
reflect
,
brother
Toby
,
upon
Man
;
and
take
a
view
of
that
dark
*NL*
side
of
him
which
represents
his
life
as
open
to
so
many
causes
of
*NL*
trouble
--
when
I
consider
,
brother
Toby
,
how
oft
we
eat
the
bread
*NL*
of
affliction
,
and
that
we
are
born
to
it
,
as
to
the
portion
of
our
*NL*
inheritance
--
I
was
born
to
nothing
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
interrupting
my
*NL*
father
--
but
my
commission
.
Zooks
!
said
my
father
,
did
not
my
uncle
leave
*NL*
you
a
hundred
and
twenty
pounds
a
year
?
--
What
could
I
have
done
without
*NL*
it
?
replied
my
uncle
Toby
--
That
's
another
concern
,
said
my
father
*NL*
testily
--
But
I
say
Toby
,
when
one
runs
over
the
catalogue
of
all
the
*NL*
cross-reckonings
and
sorrowful
Items
with
which
the
heart
of
man
is
*NL*
overcharged
,
't
is
wonderful
by
what
hidden
resources
the
mind
is
enabled
*NL*
to
stand
out
,
and
bear
itself
up
,
as
it
does
,
against
the
impositions
*NL*
laid
upon
our
nature
.
--
'T
is
by
the
assistance
of
Almighty
God
,
cried
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
up
,
and
pressing
the
palms
of
his
hands
close
*NL*
together
--
't
is
not
from
our
own
strength
,
brother
Shandy
--
a
centinel
*NL*
in
a
wooden
centry-box
might
as
well
pretend
to
stand
it
out
against
a
*NL*
detachment
of
fifty
men
.
--
We
are
upheld
by
the
grace
and
the
assistance
*NL*
of
the
best
of
Beings
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
is
cutting
the
knot
,
said
my
father
,
instead
of
untying
it
,
--
But
*NL*
give
me
leave
to
lead
you
,
brother
Toby
,
a
little
deeper
into
the
*NL*
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
my
heart
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
instantly
exchanged
the
attitude
he
was
in
,
for
that
in
which
*NL*
Socrates
is
so
finely
painted
by
Raffael
in
his
school
of
Athens
;
which
*NL*
your
connoisseurship
knows
is
so
exquisitely
imagined
,
that
even
the
*NL*
particular
manner
of
the
reasoning
of
Socrates
is
expressed
by
it
--
for
*NL*
he
holds
the
fore-finger
of
his
left-hand
between
the
fore-finger
and
*NL*
the
thumb
of
his
right
,
and
seems
as
if
he
was
saying
to
the
libertine
*NL*
he
is
reclaiming
--
`
You
grant
me
this
--
and
this
:
and
this
,
and
this
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
ask
of
you
--
they
follow
of
themselves
in
course
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
stood
my
father
,
holding
fast
his
fore-finger
betwixt
his
finger
and
*NL*
his
thumb
,
and
reasoning
with
my
uncle
Toby
as
he
sat
in
his
old
*NL*
fringed
chair
,
valanced
around
with
party-coloured
worsted
bobs
--
O
*NL*
Garrick
!
--
what
a
rich
scene
of
this
would
thy
exquisite
powers
make
!
*NL*
and
how
gladly
would
I
write
such
another
to
avail
myself
of
thy

immortality
,
and
secure
my
own
behind
it

Though
man
is
of
all
others
the
most
curious
vehicle
,
said
my
father
,
*NL*
yet
at
the
same
time
't
is
of
so
slight
a
frame
,
and
so
totteringly
put
*NL*
together
,
that
the
sudden
jerks
and
hard
jostlings
it
unavoidably
meets
*NL*
with
in
this
rugged
journey
,
would
overset
and
tear
it
to
pieces
a
dozen
*NL*
times
a
day
--
was
it
not
,
brother
Toby
,
that
there
is
a
secret
*NL*
spring
within
us
.
--
Which
spring
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
take
to
be
*NL*
Religion
.
--
Will
that
set
my
child
's
nose
on
?
cried
my
father
,
letting
*NL*
go
his
finger
,
and
striking
one
hand
against
the
other
.
--
It
makes
every
*NL*
thing
straight
for
us
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
Figuratively
speaking
,
*NL*
dear
Toby
,
it
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
said
my
father
;
but
the
spring
I
*NL*
am
speaking
of
,
is
that
great
and
elastic
power
within
us
of
*NL*
counterbalancing
evil
,
which
,
like
a
secret
spring
in
a
well-ordered
*NL*
machine
,
though
it
ca
n't
prevent
the
shock
--
at
least
it
imposes
upon
our
*NL*
sense
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
my
dear
brother
,
said
my
father
,
replacing
his
fore-finger
,
as
*NL*
he
was
coming
closer
to
the
point
--
had
my
child
arrived
safe
into
the
*NL*
world
,
unmartyr
'd
in
that
precious
part
of
him
--
fanciful
and
extravagant
*NL*
as
I
may
appear
to
the
world
in
my
opinion
of
christian
names
,
and
of
*NL*
that
magic
bias
which
good
or
bad
names
irresistibly
impress
upon
*NL*
our
characters
and
conducts
--
Heaven
is
witness
!
that
in
the
warmest
*NL*
transports
of
my
wishes
for
the
prosperity
of
my
child
,
I
never
once
*NL*
wished
to
crown
his
head
with
more
glory
and
honour
than
what
George
or
*NL*
Edward
would
have
spread
around
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
alas
!
continued
my
father
,
as
the
greatest
evil
has
befallen
him
--
I
*NL*
must
counteract
and
undo
it
with
the
greatest
good
.

He
shall
be
christened
Trismegistus

What
a

,
said
my

,
turning
himself
about
upon
*NL*
the
first
landing
,
as
he
and
my

Toby
were
going
down
stairs
,
what
*NL*
a
long
chapter
of

do
the
events
of

lay
open
to
us
!
*NL*
Take
pen
and
ink
in
hand
,
brother
Toby
,
and
calculate
it
fairly
--
I
know
*NL*
no
more
of
calculation
than
this
balluster
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
-LRB-
striking
*NL*
short
of
it
with
his
crutch
,
and
hitting
my
father
a
desperate
blow
*NL*
souse
upon
his
shin-bone
-RRB-
--
'T
was
a
hundred
to
one-cried
my
uncle
Toby
--
I
*NL*
thought
,
quoth
my
father
,
-LRB-
rubbing
his
shin
-RRB-
you
had
known
nothing
of
*NL*
calculations
,
brother
Toby
.
A
mere
chance
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
Then
it
*NL*
adds
one
to
the
chapter
--
replied
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
double
success
of
my
father
's
repartees
tickled
off
the
pain
of
his
*NL*
shin
at
once
--
it
was
well
it
so
fell
out
--
-LRB-
chance
!
again
-RRB-
--
or
the
world
*NL*
to
this
day
had
never
known
the
subject
of
my
father
's
calculation
--
to
*NL*
guess
it
--
there
was
no
chance
--
What
a
lucky
chapter
of
chances
has
this
*NL*
turned
out
!
for
it
has
saved
me
the
trouble
of
writing
one
express
,
and
*NL*
in
truth
I
have
enough
already
upon
my
hands
without
it
.
--
Have
not
I
*NL*
promised
the
world
a
chapter
of
knots
?
two
chapters
upon
the
right
*NL*
and
the
wrong
end
of
a
woman
?
a
chapter
upon
whiskers
?
a
chapter
upon
*NL*
wishes
?
--
a

?
--
No
,
I
have
done
that
--
a
chapter
upon
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
modesty
?
to
say
nothing
of
a
chapter
upon

,
which
I
*NL*
will
finish
before
I
sleep
--
by
my
great
grandfather
's
whiskers
,
I
shall
*NL*
never
get
half
of
'em
through

Take
pen
and
ink
in
hand
,
and
calculate
it
fairly

Toby

said
my
*NL*
father
,
and
it
will
turn
out
a
million
to
one
,
that
of
all
the
parts
of
*NL*
the
body
,
the
edge
of
the
forceps
should
have
the
ill
luck
just
to
fall

upon

down

which
should
break
down

may

let

Sir

I
can
no

more
help

A
sudden
impulse
comes
across

--
drop
*NL*
the
curtain

Shandy

I
drop
it

Strike
a

I
strike

The
deuce
of
any
other
rule
have
I
to
govern
myself
by
in
this
*NL*
affair
--
and
if
I
had
one
--
as
I
do
all
things
out
of
all
rule
--
I
would
*NL*
twist
it
and
tear
it
to
pieces
,
and
throw
it
into
the
fire
when
I
had
*NL*
done
--
Am
I
warm

I
am
,
and
the
cause
demands
it
--
a
pretty

is
a

man
to
follow
rules

or
rules
to
follow
him

Now
this
,
you
must
know
,
being
my
chapter
upon
chapters
,
which
I
*NL*
promised
to
write
before
I
went
to
sleep
,
I
thought
it
meet
to
ease
my
*NL*
conscience
entirely
before
I
laid
down
,
by
telling
the
world
all
I
knew
*NL*
about
the
matter
at
once
:
Is
not
this
ten
times
better
than
to
set
out
*NL*
dogmatically
with
a
sententious
parade
of
wisdom
,
and
telling
the
world
*NL*
a
story
of
a
roasted
horse
--
that
chapters
relieve
the
mind
--
that
they
*NL*
assist
--
or
impose
upon
the
imagination
--
and
that
in
a
work
of
this
*NL*
dramatic
cast
they
are
as
necessary
as
the
shifting
of
scenes
--
with
*NL*
fifty
other
cold
conceits
,
enough
to
extinguish
the
fire
which
roasted
*NL*
him
?
--
O
!
but
to
understand
this
,
which
is
a
puff
at
the
fire
of
Diana
's
*NL*
temple
--
you
must
read
Longinus
--
read
away
--
if
you
are
not
a
jot
*NL*
the
wiser
by
reading
him
the
first
time
over
--
never
fear
--
read
him
*NL*
again
--
Avicenna
and
Licetus
read
Aristotle
's
metaphysicks
forty
times
*NL*
through
a-piece
,
and
never
understood
a
single
word
.
--
But
mark
the
*NL*
consequence
--
Avicenna
turned
out
a
desperate
writer
at
all
kinds
of
*NL*
writing
--
for
he
wrote
books
de
omni
scribili
;
and
for
Licetus
-LRB-
Fortunio

though
all
the

was

cried

over

again
from

,
and
calling
to
Susannah
,
whom
he
saw
passing

by
the

of

with
a

pin-cushion
in

--
how
does
*NL*
your

?
As
well
,
said
Susannah
,
tripping
by
,
but
without
looking
*NL*
up
,
as
can
be
expected
.
--
What
a

said
my

drawing
his

back
again
--
let

be

,
brother
Toby

't
is
ever
the

precise
answer
--
And
how
is
the

pray
?

No

And
where
is

Dr.
Slop
?
added
my
father
,
raising
his
voice
aloud
,
and
looking
over
the
*NL*
ballusters
--
Susannah
was
out
of

Of
all

said
my

,
crossing
the
*NL*
landing
in
order
to
set
his
back
against
the
wall
,
whilst
he
propounded
*NL*
it
to
my
uncle
Toby
--
of
all
the
puzzling
riddles
,
said
he
,
in
a
marriage
*NL*
state
,
--
of
which
you
may
trust
me
,
brother
Toby
,
there
are
more
asses
*NL*
loads
than
all
Job
's
stock
of
asses
could
have
carried
--
there
is
not
one
*NL*
that
has
more
intricacies
in
it
than
this
--
that
from
the
very
moment
*NL*
the
mistress
of
the
house
is
brought
to
bed
,
every
female
in
it
,
from
my
*NL*
lady
's
gentlewoman
down
to
the
cinder-wench
,
becomes
an
inch
taller
for
*NL*
it
;
and
give
themselves
more
airs
upon
that
single
inch
,
than
all
their
*NL*
other
inches
put
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
rather

replied
my

Toby
,
that
't

we
who
sink
an

If

Yes

said
my

shaking
his

*NL*
too

never

my

off

put

for
except
a

nap
,
which
they
both
got
*NL*
whilst

was
boring
the

which
,
by-the-bye
,
did
my
*NL*
father
no
sort
of
good
,
upon
the
score
of
the
bad
hinge
--
they
have
not
*NL*
else
shut
their
eyes
,
since
nine
hours
before
the
time
that
doctor
Slop
*NL*
was
led
into
the
back
parlour
in
that
dirty
pickle
by
Obadiah
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
every
day
of
my
life
to
be
as
busy
a

as
this

and
to
take
*NL*
up
--
Truce
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
not
finish
that
sentence
till
I
have
made
an
observation
upon
the
*NL*
strange
state
of
affairs
between
the
reader
and
myself
,
just
as
things
*NL*
stand
at
present
--
an
observation
never
applicable
before
to
any
one
*NL*
biographical
writer
since
the
creation
of
the
world
,
but
to
myself
--
and
*NL*
I
believe
,
will
never
hold
good
to
any
other
,
until
its
final
*NL*
destruction
--
and
therefore
,
for
the
very
novelty
of
it
alone
,
it
must
be
*NL*
worth
your
worships
attending
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
this

one
whole
year
older
than
I
was
this
time
twelve-month
;
*NL*
and
having
got
,
as
you
perceive
,
almost
into
the
middle
of
my
third
*NL*
volume
-LRB-
According
to
the
preceding
Editions
.
-RRB-
--
and
no
farther
than
to
*NL*
my
first
day
's
life
--
't
is
demonstrative
that
I
have
three
hundred
and
*NL*
sixty-four
days
more
life
to
write
just
now
,
than
when
I
first
set
out
;
*NL*
so
that
instead
of
advancing
,
as
a
common
writer
,
in
my
work
with
what
I
*NL*
have
been
doing
at
it
--
on
the
contrary
,
I
am
just
thrown
so
many
volumes
*NL*
back
--
was
every
day
of
my
life
to
be
as
busy
a
day
as
this
--
And
why
*NL*
not
?
--
and
the
transactions
and
opinions
of
it
to
take
up
as
much
*NL*
description
--
And
for
what
reason
should
they
be
cut
short
?
as
at
this
*NL*
rate
I
should
just
live
364
times
faster
than
I
should
write
--
It
must
*NL*
follow
,
an
'
please
your
worships
,
that
the
more
I
write
,
the
more
I
*NL*
shall
have
to
write
--
and
consequently
,
the
more
your
worships
read
,
the
*NL*
more
your

will
have
to

.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
this
be
good
for
your

eyes
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
do
well
for
mine
;
and
,
was
it
not
that
my
Opinions
will
be
*NL*
the
death
of
me
,
I
perceive
I
shall
lead
a
fine
life
of
it
out
of
this
*NL*
self-same
life
of
mine
;
or
,
in
other
words
,
shall
lead
a
couple
of
fine
*NL*
lives
together

*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
proposal
of
twelve
volumes
a
year
,
or
a
volume
a
month
,
it
*NL*
no
way
alters
my
prospect
--
write
as
I
will
,
and
rush
as
I
may
into
*NL*
the
middle
of
things
,
as
Horace
advises
--
I
shall
never
overtake
myself
*NL*
whipp
'd
and
driven
to
the
last
pinch
;
at
the
worst
I
shall
have
one
*NL*
day
the
start
of
my
pen
--
and
one
day
is
enough
for
two
volumes
--
and
two
*NL*
volumes
will
be
enough
for
one
year

*NL*
Heaven
prosper
the

of

under
this
propitious
reign

is
now
opened

I
trust
its
providence
will
prosper
every
*NL*
thing
else
in
it
that
is
taken
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
propagation
of
Geese

I
give
myself
no

Nature

I
shall
never
want
tools

reach

As

what
?
said
*NL*
my
father
,
for
like
all
orators
,
he
was
a
dear
searcher
into
*NL*
comparisons
.
--
Bless
,
me
,
Sir
,
said
Susannah
,
the
child
's
in
a
fit
.
--
And
*NL*
where
's
Mr.
Yorick
?
--
Never
where
he
should
be
,
said
Susannah
,
but
his
*NL*
curate
's
in
the
dressing-room
,
with
the
child
upon
his
arm
,
waiting
*NL*
for
the
name
--
and
my
mistress
bid
me
run
as
fast
as
I
could
to
know
,
as
*NL*
captain
Shandy
is
the
godfather
,
whether
it
should
not
be
called
after
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Were
one
sure
,
said
my
father
to
himself
,
scratching
his
eye-brow
,
that
*NL*
the
child
was
expiring
,
one
might
as
well
compliment
my
brother
Toby
as
*NL*
not
--
and
it
would
be
a
pity
,
in
such
a
case
,
to
throw
away
so
great
a
*NL*
name
as
Trismegistus
upon
him
--
but
he
may
recover
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
no
,
--
said
my
father
to
Susannah
,
I
'll
get
up
--
There
is
no
time
,
*NL*
cried
Susannah
,
the
child
's
as
black
as
my
shoe
.
Trismegistus
,
said
my
*NL*
father
--
But
stay
--
thou
art
a
leaky
vessel
,
Susannah
,
added
my
father
;
*NL*
canst
thou
carry
Trismegistus
in
thy
head
,
the
length
of
the
gallery
*NL*
without
scattering
?
--
Can
I
?
cried
Susannah
,
shutting
the
door
in
a
*NL*
huff
.
--
If
she
can
,
I
'll
be
shot
,
said
my
father
,
bouncing
out
of
bed
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
and
groping
for
his
breeches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susannah
ran
with
all
speed
along
the
gallery
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
made
all
possible
speed
to
find
his
breeches
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susannah
got
the
start
,
and
kept
it
--
'T
is
Tris
--
something
,
cried
*NL*
Susannah
--
There
is
no
christian-name
in
the
world
,
said
the
curate
,
*NL*
beginning
with
Tris
--
but
Tristram
.
Then
't
is
Tristram-gistus
,
quoth
*NL*
Susannah
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
is
no
gistus
to
it
,
noodle
!
--
't
is
my
own
name
,
replied
the
*NL*
curate
,
dipping
his
hand
,
as
he
spoke
,
into
the
bason
--
Tristram
!
said
*NL*
he
,
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
--
so
Tristram
was
I
called
,
and
Tristram
shall
I
be
*NL*
to
the
day
of
my
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
followed
Susannah
,
with
his
night-gown
across
his
arm
,
with
*NL*
nothing
more
than
his
breeches
on
,
fastened
through
haste
with
but
a
*NL*
single
button
,
and
that
button
through
haste
thrust
only
half
into
the
*NL*
button-hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
She
has
not
forgot
the
name
,
cried
my
father
,
half
opening
the
*NL*
door
?
--
No
,
no
,
said
the
curate
,
with
a
tone
of
intelligence
.
--
And
the
*NL*
child
is
better
,
cried
Susannah
.
--
And
how
does
your
mistress
?
As
well
,
*NL*
said
Susannah
,
as
can
be
expected
.
--
Pish
!
said
my
father
,
the
button
*NL*
of
his
breeches
slipping
out
of
the
button-hole
--
So
that
whether
the
*NL*
interjection
was
levelled
at
Susannah
,
or
the
button-hole
--
whether
Pish
*NL*
was
an
interjection
of
contempt
or
an
interjection
of
modesty
,
is
a
*NL*
doubt
,
and
must
be
a
doubt
till
I
shall
have
time
to
write
the
three
*NL*
following
favourite
chapters
,
that
is
,
my
chapter
of
chamber-maids
,
my
*NL*
chapter
of
pishes
,
and
my
chapter
of
button-holes
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
light
I
am
able
to
give
the
reader
at
present
is
this
,
that
*NL*
the
moment
my
father
cried
Pish
!
he
whisk
'd
himself
about
--
and
with
his
*NL*
breeches
held
up
by
one
hand
,
and
his
night-gown
thrown
across
the
arm
*NL*
of
the
other
,
he
turned
along
the
gallery
to
bed
,
something

I

write
a

upon

A
fitter
occasion
could
never
have
presented
itself
,
than
what
this
*NL*
moment
offers
,
when
all
the
curtains
of

are
drawn
--
the
*NL*
candles
put
out

and
no
creature

are

a
single
one

for
*NL*
the

has
been
shut
these

of

*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
fine
subject

And
yet
,
as
fine
as
it
is
,
I
would
undertake
to
write
a
dozen
chapters
*NL*
upon
button-holes
,
both
quicker
and
with
more
fame
,
than
a
single
*NL*
chapter
upon
this

*NL*
*NL*
Button-holes
!
there
is
something
lively
in
the
very
idea
of
'em
--
and
*NL*
trust
me
,
when
I
get
amongst
'em
--
You
gentry
with
great
beards

look
as
*NL*
grave
as
you
will
--
I
'll
make
merry
work
with
my
button-holes
--
I
shall
*NL*
have
'em
all
to
myself
--
't
is
a
maiden
subject

I
shall
run
foul
of
no
*NL*
man
's
wisdom
or
fine
sayings
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
sleep
--
I
know
I
shall
make
nothing
of
it
before
I
begin
--
I
am
no
*NL*
dab
at
your
fine
sayings
in
the
first
place
--
and
in
the
next
,
I
can
not
*NL*
for
my
soul
set
a
grave
face
upon
a
bad
matter
,
and
tell
the
world
--
't
is
*NL*
the
refuge
of
the
unfortunate
--
the
enfranchisement
of
the
prisoner
--
the
*NL*
downy
lap
of
the
hopeless
,
the
weary
,
and
the
broken-hearted
;
nor
could
*NL*
I
set
out
with
a
lye
in
my
mouth
,
by
affirming
,
that
of
all
the
soft
and
*NL*
delicious
functions
of
our
nature
,
by
which
the
great
Author
of
it
,
in
*NL*
his
bounty
,
has
been
pleased
to
recompence
the
sufferings
wherewith
his
*NL*
justice
and
his
good
pleasure
has
wearied
us
--
that
this
is
the
chiefest
*NL*
-LRB-
I
know
pleasures
worth
ten
of

or
what
a
happiness
it
is
to
man
,
*NL*
when
the
anxieties
and
passions
of
the
day
are
over
,
and
he
lies
*NL*
down
upon
his
back
,
that
his
soul
shall
be
so
seated
within
him
,
that
*NL*
whichever
way
she
turns
her
eyes
,
the
heavens
shall
look
calm
and
sweet
*NL*
above
her
--
no
desire
--
or
fear
--
or
doubt
that
troubles
the
air
,
nor
any
*NL*
difficulty
past
,
present
,
or
to
come
,
that
the
imagination
may
not
pass
*NL*
over
without
offence
,
in
that
sweet
secession

Sancho
Panca

upon

invented
*NL*
this
self-same
thing
called
sleep
--
it
covers
a
man
all
over
like
a
*NL*
cloak
.
'
Now
there
is
more
to
me
in
this
,
and
it
speaks
warmer
to
my
*NL*
heart
and
affections
,
than
all
the
dissertations
squeez
'd
out
of
the
*NL*
heads
of
the
learned
together
upon
the
subject

Not

I
altogether
disapprove
of
what
Montaigne
advances
upon

it

is
admirable
in
its
way

-LRB-
I
quote
by
memory
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
world
enjoys
other
pleasures

says
he
,
as
they
do
that
of
sleep
,
*NL*
without
tasting
or
feeling
it
as
it
slips
and
passes
by
.
--
We
should
*NL*
study
and
ruminate
upon
it
,
in
order
to
render
proper
thanks
to
him
*NL*
who
grants
it
to
us
.
--
For
this
end
I
cause
myself
to
be
disturbed
in
my
*NL*
sleep
,
that
I
may
the
better
and
more
sensibly
relish
it
.
--
And
yet
I
*NL*
see
few
,
says
he
again
,
who
live
with
less
sleep
,
when
need
requires
;
my
*NL*
body
is
capable
of
a
firm
,
but
not
of
a
violent
and
sudden
agitation
--
I
*NL*
evade
of
late
all
violent
exercises
--
I
am
never
weary
with
walking
--
but
*NL*
from
my
youth
,
I
never
looked
to
ride
upon
pavements
.
I
love
to
lie
*NL*
hard
and
alone
,
and
even
without
my
wife
--
This
last
word
may
stagger
the
*NL*
faith
of
the
world
--
but
remember

`
La

When
the
misfortune
of
my
Nose
fell
so
heavily
upon
my
father
's

head
;
--
the
reader
remembers
that
he
walked
instantly
up
stairs
,
and
cast
*NL*
himself
down
upon
his
bed
;
and
from
hence
,
unless
he
has
a
great
insight
*NL*
into
human
nature
,
he
will
be
apt
to
expect
a
rotation
of
the
same
*NL*
ascending
and
descending
movements
from
him
,
upon
this
misfortune
of
my
*NL*
Name
;

no

*NL*
The
different
weight
,
dear
Sir
--
nay
even
the
different
package
of
two
*NL*
vexations
of
the
same
weight
--
makes
a
very
wide
difference
in
our
manner
*NL*
of
bearing
and
getting
through
with
them
.
--
It
is
not
half
an
hour
ago
,
*NL*
when
-LRB-
in
the
great
hurry
and
precipitation
of
a
poor
devil
's
writing
*NL*
for
daily
bread
-RRB-
I
threw
a
fair
sheet
,
which
I
had
just
finished
,
and
*NL*
carefully
wrote
out
,
slap
into
the
fire
,
instead
of
the
foul
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
I
snatch
'd
off
my
wig
,
and
threw
it
perpendicularly
,
with
all
*NL*
imaginable
violence
,
up
to
the
top
of
the
room
--
indeed
I
caught
it
as
it
*NL*
fell
--
but
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
;
nor
do
I
think
any
think
else
*NL*
in
Nature
would
have
given
such
immediate
ease
:
She
,
dear
Goddess
,
by
an
*NL*
instantaneous
impulse
,
in
all
provoking
cases
,
determines
us
to
a
sally
*NL*
of
this
or
that
member
--
or
else
she
thrusts
us
into
this
or
that
place
,
*NL*
or
posture
of
body
,
we
know
not
why
--
But
mark
,
madam
,
we
live
amongst
*NL*
riddles
and
mysteries
--
the
most
obvious
things
,
which
come
in
our
way
,
*NL*
have
dark
sides
,
which
the
quickest
sight
can
not
penetrate
into
;
and
*NL*
even
the
clearest
and
most
exalted
understandings
amongst
us
find
*NL*
ourselves
puzzled
and
at
a
loss
in
almost
every
cranny
of
nature
's
*NL*
works
:
so
that
this
,
like
a
thousand
other
things
,
falls
out
for
us
in
*NL*
a
way
,
which
tho
'
we
can
not
reason
upon
it
--
yet
we
find
the
good
of
it
,
*NL*
may
it
please
your
reverences
and
your
worships
--
and
that
's
enough
for
*NL*
us
.

Now
,
my
father
could
not
lie
down
with
this
affliction
for
his
life
--
nor
*NL*
could
he
carry
it
up
stairs
like
the
other
--
he
walked
composedly
out
*NL*
with
it
to
the
fish-pond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
my
father
leaned
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
reasoned
an
hour
which
*NL*
way
to
have
gone
--
reason
,
with
all
her
force
,
could
not
have
directed
*NL*
him
to
any
think
like
it
:
there
is
something
,
Sir
,
in
fish-ponds
--
but
*NL*
what
it
is
,
I
leave
to
system-builders
and
fish-pond-diggers
betwixt
*NL*
'em
to
find
out
--
but
there
is
something
,
under
the
first
disorderly
*NL*
transport
of
the
humours
,
so
unaccountably
becalming
in
an
orderly
and
a
*NL*
sober
walk
towards
one
of
them
,
that
I
have
often
wondered
that
neither
*NL*
Pythagoras
,
nor
Plato
,
nor
Solon
,
nor
Lycurgus

nor
Mahomet

nor
any

ever
gave
order
about

of

it
gives
me
great
concern

I
am
heartily
concerned
*NL*
too
,
but
I
hope
your
honour
,
replied
Trim
,
will
do
me
the
justice
*NL*
to
believe
,
that
it
was
not
in
the

owing
to
me
.

To
*NL*
thee

Trim

cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
kindly
in
his
face
--
't
was
*NL*
Susannah
's
and
the
curate
's
folly
betwixt
them
.

What
business
could
*NL*
they
have
together

garden

In

*NL*
gallery
thou
meanest

replied
my
uncle
Toby

*NL*
*NL*
Trim
found
he
was
upon
a
wrong
scent
,
and
stopped
short
with
a
low
*NL*
bow
--
Two
misfortunes
,
quoth
the
corporal
to
himself
,
are
twice
as
many
*NL*
at
least
as
are
needful
to
be
talked
over
at
one
time
;
--
the
mischief
the
*NL*
cow
has
done
in
breaking
into
the
fortifications
,
may
be
told

honour
*NL*
hereafter
.
--
Trim
's
casuistry
and
address
,
under
the
cover
of
his
low
*NL*
bow
,
prevented
all
suspicion
in
my
uncle
Toby
,
so
he
went
on
with
what
*NL*
he
had
to
say
to
Trim
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
my
own
part
,
Trim
,
though
I
can
see
little
or
no
difference
*NL*
betwixt
my
nephew
's
being
called
Tristram
or
Trismegistus
--
yet
as
the
*NL*
thing
sits
so
near
my
brother
's
heart
,
Trim
--
I
would
freely
have
given
*NL*
a
hundred
pounds
rather
than
it
should
have
happened
.
--
A
hundred
pounds
,
*NL*
an
'
please
your
honour

replied
Trim
,
--
I
would
not
give
a
cherry-stone
*NL*
to
boot
.
--
Nor
would
I
,
Trim
,
upon
my
own
account
,
quoth
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
--
but
my
brother
,
whom
there
is
no
arguing
with
in
this
*NL*
case
--
maintains
that
a
great
deal
more
depends
,
Trim
,
upon
*NL*
christian-names
,
than
what
ignorant
people
imagine
--
for
he
says
there
*NL*
never
was
a
great
or
heroic
action
performed
since
the
world
began
by
*NL*
one
called
Tristram
--
nay
,
he
will
have
it
,
Trim
,
that
a
man
can
*NL*
neither
be
learned
,
or
wise
,
or
brave
.
--
'T
is
all
fancy
,
an
'
please
your
*NL*
honour
--
I
fought
just
as
well
,
replied
the
corporal
,
when
the
regiment
*NL*
called
me
Trim
,
as
when
they
called
me
James
Butler
.

And
for
my
own
*NL*
part
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
though
I
should
blush
to
boast
of
myself
,
*NL*
Trim

yet
had
my
name
been
Alexander
,
I
could
have
done
no
more
at
Namur
*NL*
than
my
duty
.
--
Bless
your
honour
!
cried
Trim
,
advancing
three
steps
as
*NL*
he
spoke
,
does
a
man
think
of
his
christian-name
when
he
goes
upon
the
*NL*
attack
?

Or
when
he
stands
in
the
trench

Trim

cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
looking
firm

Or
when
he
enters

Trim

pushing
in
between

two
chairs

Or
forces
the
lines

cried
my
uncle

rising
up

and
pushing

his
crutch
like
a
pike

Or
facing

cried
Trim

presenting
his

stick
like
a
firelock

Or
when
he
marches
up

glacis

cried
my

looking
warm

setting
his
foot
upon
his
stool

Trim
recovered
his
arms
--
never
was
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
caught
in
riding
at
such
a
desperate
rate
in
his
life
!
Alas
!
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
!
had
not
a
weightier
matter
called
forth
all
the
ready
eloquence
*NL*
of
my
father
--
how
hadst
thou
then
and
thy
poor
Hobby-Horse
too
been
*NL*
insulted
!
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
hung
up
his
hat
with
the
same
air
he
took
it
down
;
and
after
*NL*
giving
a
slight
look
at
the
disorder
of
the
room
,
he
took
hold
of
one
*NL*
of
the
chairs
which
had
formed
the
corporal
's
breach
,
and
placing
*NL*
it
over-against
my
uncle
Toby
,
he
sat
down
in
it
,
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
the
tea-things
were
taken
away
,
and
the
door
shut
,
he
broke
out
in
a
*NL*
lamentation
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
Father
's
Lamentation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
in
vain
longer
,
said
my
father
,
addressing
himself
as
much
*NL*
to
Ernulphus
's
curse
,
which
was
laid
upon
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
--
as
to
my
uncle
Toby
who
sat
under
it
--
it
is
in
vain
*NL*
longer
,
said
my
father
,
in
the
most
querulous
monotony
imaginable
,
*NL*
to
struggle
as
I
have
done
against
this
most
uncomfortable
of
human
*NL*
persuasions
--
I
see
it
plainly
,
that
either
for
my
own
sins
,
brother
*NL*
Toby
,
or
the
sins
and
follies
of
the
Shandy
family
,
Heaven
has
thought
*NL*
fit
to
draw
forth
the
heaviest
of
its
artillery
against
me
;
and
that
the
*NL*
prosperity
of
my
child
is
the
point
upon
which
the
whole
force
of
it
is
*NL*
directed
to
play
.
--
Such
a
thing
would
batter
the
whole
universe
about
*NL*
our
ears
,
brother
Shandy
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
if
it
was
so-Unhappy
*NL*
Tristram
!
child
of
wrath
!
child
of
decrepitude
!
interruption
!
mistake
!
*NL*
and
discontent
!
What
one
misfortune
or
disaster
in
the
book
of
embryotic
*NL*
evils
,
that
could
unmechanize
thy
frame
,
or
entangle
thy
filaments
!
*NL*
which
has
not
fallen
upon
thy
head
,
or
ever
thou
camest
into
the
*NL*
world
--
what
evils
in
thy
passage
into
it
!
--
what
evils
since
!
--
produced
*NL*
into
being
,
in
the
decline
of
thy
father
's
days
--
when
the
powers
of
his
*NL*
imagination
and
of
his
body
were
waxing
feeble
--
when
radical
heat
and
*NL*
radical
moisture
,
the
elements
which
should
have
temper
'd
thine
,
were
*NL*
drying
up
;
and
nothing
left
to
found
thy
stamina
in
,
but
negations
--
't
is
*NL*
pitiful
--
brother
Toby
,
at
the
best
,
and
called
out
for
all
the
little
*NL*
helps
that
care
and
attention
on
both
sides
could
give
it
.
But
how
were
*NL*
we
defeated
!
You
know
the
event
,
brother
Toby
--
't
is
too
melancholy
a
*NL*
one
to
be
repeated
now
--
when
the
few
animal
spirits
I
was
worth
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
with
which
memory
,
fancy
,
and
quick
parts
should
have
been
*NL*
convey
'd
--
were
all
dispersed
,
confused
,
confounded
,
scattered
,
and
sent
*NL*
to
the
devil
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Here
then
was
the
time
to
have
put
a
stop
to
this
persecution
against
*NL*
him
;
--
and
tried
an
experiment
at
least
--
whether
calmness
and
serenity
*NL*
of
mind
in
your
sister
,
with
a
due
attention
,
brother
Toby
,
to
her
*NL*
evacuations
and
repletions
--
and
the
rest
of
her
non-naturals
,
might
not
,
*NL*
in
a
course
of
nine
months
gestation
,
have
set
all
things
to
rights
.
--
My
*NL*
child
was
bereft
of
these
!
--
What
a
teazing
life
did
she
lead
herself
,
*NL*
and
consequently
her
foetus
too
,
with
that
nonsensical
anxiety
of
hers
*NL*
about
lying-in
in
town
?
I
thought
my
sister
submitted
with
the
greatest
*NL*
patience
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
--
I
never
heard
her
utter
one
fretful
*NL*
word
about
it
.
--
She
fumed
inwardly
,
cried
my
father
;
and
that
,
let
me
*NL*
tell
you
,
brother
,
was
ten
times
worse
for
the
child
--
and
then
!
what
*NL*
battles
did
she
fight
with
me
,
and
what
perpetual
storms
about
the
*NL*
midwife
.
--
There
she
gave
vent
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.

Vent

cried
my
*NL*
father
,
looking
up

*NL*

But
what
was
all
this

my
dear
Toby
,
to
the
injuries
done
us
by
my
*NL*
child

coming

when
all
I
wished

With

Still
,

there
was
one

left
for

O

I
gone

As
Francis
the
first
of
France
was
one
winterly
night
warming
himself
*NL*
over
the
embers
of
a
wood
fire
,
and
talking
with

sundry

It
*NL*
would
not
be
amiss
,
said
the
king
,
stirring
up
the
embers
with
his
*NL*
cane
,
if
this
good
understanding
betwixt
ourselves
and
Switzerland
was
*NL*
a
little
strengthened
.
--
There
is
no
end
,
Sire
,
replied
the
minister
,
*NL*
in
giving
money
to
these
people
--
they
would
swallow
up
the
treasury
*NL*
of
France

--
Poo

the
king
--
there
are
more
ways

Mons

*NL*
le
Premier

of

that
of

--
Your

majesty

said
the
minister
,
in
so
doing
,
would
have
all
the
grammarians
*NL*

Europe
upon
your
back
;
--
Switzerland

as
a

being
a
female
,
*NL*
can
in
no
construction
be
godfather

She
may

Francis
hastily

announce
my
intentions

a
courier
to-morrow
*NL*
morning

*NL*
*NL*
I

said

the
First

-LRB-
that

-RRB-
speaking
*NL*
to

he
entered
the

no

replied
the

*NL*
have
the
highest
sense
of
the
honour
your

has
done
them

but
the
*NL*
republick

claims
her
right

of
naming

In

some

the

I

this

we
shall
at
least
know
the
worst
of
this
matter
.
I
hate
these
great
*NL*
dinners
--
said
my
father
--
The
size
of
the
dinner
is
not
the
point
,
*NL*
answered
Yorick
--
we
want
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
to
dive
into
the
bottom
of
this
*NL*
doubt
,
whether
the
name
can
be
changed
or
not
--
and
as
the
beards
of
so
*NL*
many
commissaries
,
officials
,
advocates
,
proctors
,
registers
,
and
of
the
*NL*
most
eminent
of
our
school-divines
,
and
others
,
are
all
to
meet
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
one
table
,
and
Didius
has
so
pressingly
invited
you
--
who
*NL*
in
your
distress
would
miss
such
an
occasion
?
All
that
is
requisite
,
*NL*
continued
Yorick
,
is
to
apprize
Didius
,
and
let
him
manage
a
*NL*
conversation
after
dinner
so
as
to
introduce
the
subject
.
--
Then
my
*NL*
brother
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
clapping
his
two
hands
together
,
shall
go
*NL*
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Let
my
old
tye-wig
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
my
laced
regimentals
,
be
*NL*
hung
to
the
fire
all
night

Chapter

LX
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
doubt
,
Sir
,
--
there
is
a
whole
chapter
wanting
here
--
and
a
chasm
of
*NL*
ten
pages
made
in
the
book
by
it
--
but
the
book-binder
is
neither
a
fool
,
*NL*
or
a
knave
,
or
a
puppy
--
nor
is
the
book
a
jot
more
imperfect
-LRB-
at
least
*NL*
upon
that
score
-RRB-
--
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
the
book
is
more
perfect
and
*NL*
complete
by
wanting
the
chapter
,
than
having
it
,
as
I
shall
demonstrate
*NL*
to
your
reverences
in
this
manner
.
--
I
question
first
,
by-the-bye
,
*NL*
whether
the
same
experiment
might
not
be
made
as
successfully
upon
*NL*
sundry
other
chapters
--
but
there
is
no
end
,
an
'
please
your
reverences
,
*NL*
in
trying
experiments
upon
chapters
--
we
have
had
enough
of
it
--
So
*NL*
there
's
an
end
of
that
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
before
I
begin
my
demonstration
,
let
me
only
tell
you
,
that
the
*NL*
chapter
which
I
have
torn
out
,
and
which
otherwise
you
would
all
have
*NL*
been
reading
just
now
,
instead
of
this
--
was
the
description
of
my
*NL*
father
's
,
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
Trim
's
,
and
Obadiah
's
setting
out
and
*NL*
journeying
to
the
visitation
at
...
*NL*
*NL*
We
'll
go
in
the
coach
,
said
my
father
--
Prithee
,
have
the
arms
been
*NL*
altered
,
Obadiah
?
--
It
would
have
made
my
story
much
better
to
have
begun
*NL*
with
telling
you
,
that
at
the
time
my
mother
's
arms
were
added
to
the
*NL*
Shandy
's
,
when
the
coach
was
re-painted
upon
my
father
's
marriage
,
it
*NL*
had
so
fallen
out
that
the
coach-painter
,
whether
by
performing
all
his
*NL*
works
with
the
left
hand
,
like
Turpilius
the
Roman
,
or
Hans
Holbein
of
*NL*
Basil
--
or
whether
't
was
more
from
the
blunder
of
his
head
than
hand
--
or
*NL*
whether
,
lastly
,
it
was
from
the
sinister
turn
which
every
thing
*NL*
relating
to
our
family
was
apt
to
take
--
it
so
fell
out
,
however
,
to
*NL*
our
reproach
,
that
instead
of
the
bend-dexter
,
which
since
Harry
the
*NL*
Eighth
's
reign
was
honestly
our
due
--
a
bend-sinister
,
by
some
of
these
*NL*
fatalities
,
had
been
drawn
quite
across
the
field
of
the
Shandy
arms
.
*NL*
'T
is
scarce
credible
that
the
mind
of
so
wise
a
man
as
my
father
was
,
*NL*
could
be
so
much
incommoded
with
so
small
a
matter
.
The
word
coach
--
let
*NL*
it
be
whose
it
would
--
or
coach-man
,
or
coach-horse
,
or
coach-hire
,
could
*NL*
never
be
named
in
the
family
,
but
he
constantly
complained
of
carrying
*NL*
this
vile
mark
of
illegitimacy
upon
the
door
of
his
own
;
he
never
once
*NL*
was
able
to
step
into
the
coach
,
or
out
of
it
,
without
turning
round
to
*NL*
take
a
view
of
the
arms
,
and
making
a
vow
at
the
same
time
,
that
it
*NL*
was
the
last
time
he
would
ever
set
his
foot
in
it
again
,
till
the
*NL*
bend-sinister
was
taken
out
--
but
like
the
affair
of
the
hinge
,
it
was
*NL*
one
of
the
many
things
which
the
Destinies
had
set
down
in
their
books
*NL*
ever
to
be
grumbled
at
-LRB-
and
in
wiser
families
than
ours
-RRB-
--
but
never
to
*NL*
be
mended
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Has
the
bend-sinister
been
brush
'd
out
,
I
say
?
said
my
father
.
--
There
*NL*
has
been
nothing
brush
'd
out
,
Sir
,
answered
Obadiah
,
but
the
lining
.
*NL*
We
'll
go
o'horseback
,
said
my
father
,
turning
to
Yorick
--
Of
all
things
*NL*
in
the
world
,
except
politicks
,
the
clergy
know
the
least
of
heraldry
,
*NL*
said
Yorick
.
--
No
matter
for
that
,
cried
my
father
--
I
should
be
sorry
*NL*
to
appear
with
a
blot
in
my
escutcheon
before
them
.
--
Never
mind
the
*NL*
bend-sinister
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
putting
on
his
tye-wig
.
--
No
,
indeed
,
*NL*
said
my
father
--
you
may
go
with
my
aunt
Dinah
to
a
visitation
with
a
*NL*
bend-sinister
,
if
you
think
fit
--
My
poor
uncle
Toby
blush
'd
.
My
father
*NL*
was
vexed
at
himself
.
--
No
--
my
dear
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
*NL*
changing
his
tone
--
but
the
damp
of
the
coach-lining
about
my
loins
,
may
*NL*
give
me
the
sciatica
again
,
as
it
did
December
,
January
,
and
February
*NL*
last
winter
--
so
if
you
please
you
shall
ride
my
wife
's
pad
--
and
as
*NL*
you
are
to
preach
,
Yorick
,
you
had
better
make
the
best
of
your
way
*NL*
before
--
and
leave
me
to
take
care
of
my
brother
Toby
,
and
to
follow
at
*NL*
our
own
rates
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
chapter
I
was
obliged
to
tear
out
,
was
the
description
of
this
*NL*
cavalcade
,
in
which
Corporal
Trim
and
Obadiah
,
upon
two
coach-horses
*NL*
a-breast
,
led
the
way
as
slow
as
a
patrole
--
whilst
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
*NL*
his
laced
regimentals
and
tye-wig
,
kept
his
rank
with
my
father
,
in
deep
*NL*
roads
and
dissertations
alternately
upon
the
advantage
of
learning
and
*NL*
arms
,
as
each
could
get
the
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
the
painting
of
this
journey
,
upon
reviewing
it
,
appears
to
be
so
*NL*
much
above
the
stile
and
manner
of
any
thing
else
I
have
been
able
*NL*
to
paint
in
this
book
,
that
it
could
not
have
remained
in
it
,
without
*NL*
depreciating
every
other
scene
;
and
destroying
at
the
same
time
that
*NL*
necessary
equipoise
and
balance
,
-LRB-
whether
of
good
or
bad
-RRB-
betwixt
*NL*
chapter
and
chapter
,
from
whence
the
just
proportions
and
harmony
of
*NL*
the
whole
work
results
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
am
but
just
set
up
in
the
*NL*
business
,
so
know
little
about
it
--
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
to
write
a
book
*NL*
is
for
all
the
world
like
humming
a
song
--
be
but
in
tune
with
yourself
,
*NL*
madam
,
't
is
no
matter
how
high
or
how
low
you
take
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
is
the
reason
,
may
it
please
your
reverences
,
that
some
of
the
*NL*
lowest
and
flattest
compositions
pass
off
very
well
--
-LRB-
as
Yorick
told
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
one
night
-RRB-
by
siege
.
--
My
uncle
Toby
looked
brisk
at
the
sound
*NL*
of
the
word
siege
,
but
could
make
neither
head
or
tail
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
'm
to
preach
at
court
next
Sunday
,
said
Homenas
--
run
over
my
notes
--
so
*NL*
I
humm
'd
over
doctor
Homenas
's
notes
--
the
modulation
's
very
well
--
`
twill
*NL*
do
,
Homenas
,
if
it
holds
on
at
this
rate
--
so
on
I
humm
'd
--
and
a
*NL*
tolerable
tune
I
thought
it
was
;
and
to
this
hour
,
may
it
please
your
*NL*
reverences
,
had
never
found
out
how
low
,
how
flat
,
how
spiritless
and
*NL*
jejune
it
was
,
but
that
all
of
a
sudden
,
up
started
an
air
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
it
,
so
fine
,
so
rich
,
so
heavenly
,
--
it
carried
my
soul
up
with
it
*NL*
into
the
other
world
;
now
had
I
-LRB-
as
Montaigne
complained
in
a
*NL*
parallel
accident
-RRB-
--
had
I
found
the
declivity
easy
,
or
the
ascent
*NL*
accessible
--
certes
I
had
been
outwitted
.
--
Your
notes
,
Homenas
,
I
should
*NL*
have
said
,
are
good
notes
;
--
but
it
was
so
perpendicular
a
precipice
--
so
*NL*
wholly
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
work
,
that
by
the
first
note
I
*NL*
humm
'd
I
found
myself
flying
into
the
other
world
,
and
from
thence
*NL*
discovered
the
vale
from
whence
I
came
,
so
deep
,
so
low
,
and
dismal
,
*NL*
that
I
shall
never
have
the
heart
to
descend
into
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dwarf
who
brings
a
standard
along
with
him
to
measure
his
own
*NL*
size
--
take
my
word
,
is
a
dwarf
in
more
articles
than
one
.
--
And
so
much
*NL*
for
tearing
out
of
chapters
.

*NL*
*NL*
--
See
if
he
is
not
cutting
it
into
slips
,
and
giving
them
about
him
to
*NL*
light
their
pipes
!
--
'T
is
abominable
,
answered
Didius
;
it
should
not
*NL*
go
unnoticed
,
said
doctor
Kysarcius
--
he
was
of
the
Kysarcii
of
the
Low
*NL*
Countries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Methinks
,
said
Didius
,
half
rising
from
his
chair
,
in
order
to
remove
a
*NL*
bottle
and
a
tall
decanter
,
which
stood
in
a
direct
line
betwixt
him
and
*NL*
Yorick
--
you
might
have
spared
this
sarcastic
stroke
,
and
have
hit
upon
*NL*
a
more
proper
place
,
Mr.
Yorick
--
or
at
least
upon
a
more
proper
occasion
*NL*
to
have
shewn
your
contempt
of
what
we
have
been
about
:
If
the
sermon
is
*NL*
of
no
better
worth
than
to
light
pipes
with
--
't
was
certainly
,
Sir
,
not
*NL*
good
enough
to
be
preached
before
so
learned
a
body
;
and
if
't
was
good
*NL*
enough
to
be
preached
before
so
learned
a
body
--
't
was
certainly
Sir
,
too
*NL*
good
to
light
their
pipes
with
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
got
him
fast
hung
up
,
quoth
Didius
to
himself
,
upon
one
of
the
*NL*
two
horns
of
my
dilemma
--
let
him
get
off
as
he
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
undergone
such
unspeakable
torments
,
in
bringing
forth
this
*NL*
sermon
,
quoth
Yorick
,
upon
this
occasion
--
that
I
declare
,
Didius
,
I
*NL*
would
suffer
martyrdom
--
and
if
it
was
possible
my
horse
with
me
,
a
*NL*
thousand
times
over
,
before
I
would
sit
down
and
make
such
another
:
I
*NL*
was
delivered
of
it
at
the
wrong
end
of
me
--
it
came
from
my
head
instead
*NL*
of
my
heart
--
and
it
is
for
the
pain
it
gave
me
,
both
in
the
writing
and
*NL*
preaching
of
it
,
that
I
revenge
myself
of
it
,
in
this
manner
--
To
preach
,
*NL*
to
shew
the
extent
of
our
reading
,
or
the
subtleties
of
our
wit
--
to
*NL*
parade
in
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
with
the
beggarly
accounts
of
a
little
*NL*
learning
,
tinsel
'd
over
with
a
few
words
which
glitter
,
but
convey
*NL*
little
light
and
less
warmth
--
is
a
dishonest
use
of
the
poor
single
*NL*
half
hour
in
a
week
which
is
put
into
our
hands
--
'T
is
not
preaching
the
*NL*
gospel
--
but
ourselves
--
For
my
own
part
,
continued
Yorick
,
I
had
rather
*NL*
direct
five
words
point-blank
to
the
heart
.
--
As
Yorick
pronounced
*NL*
the
word
point-blank
,
my
uncle
Toby
rose
up
to
say
something
upon
*NL*
projectiles
--
when
a
single
word
and
no
more
uttered
from
the
opposite
*NL*
side
of
the
table
drew
every
one
's
ears
towards
it
--
a
word
of
all
others
*NL*
in
the
dictionary
the
last
in
that
place
to
be
expected
--
a
word
I
am
*NL*
ashamed
to
write
--
yet
must
be
written
--
must
be
read
--
illegal
--
*NL*
uncanonical
--
guess
ten
thousand
guesses
,
multiplied
into
themselves
--
*NL*
rack
--
torture
your
invention
for
ever
,
you
're
where
you
was
--
In
short
,
*NL*
I
'll
tell
it
in
the
next
chapter
.

*NL*
Zounds
!
--
Z.
.
.
ds
!
cried
Phutatorius
,
partly
to
himself
--
and
yet
high
*NL*
enough
to
be
heard
--
and
what
seemed
odd
,
't
was
uttered
in
a
construction
*NL*
of
look
,
and
in
a
tone
of
voice
,
somewhat
between
that
of
a
man
in
*NL*
amazement
and
one
in
bodily
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
or
two
who
had
very
nice
ears
,
and
could
distinguish
the
expression
*NL*
and
mixture
of
the
two
tones
as
plainly
as
a
third
or
a
fifth
,
or
any
*NL*
other
chord
in
musick
--
were
the
most
puzzled
and
perplexed
with
it
--
the
*NL*
concord
was
good
in
itself
--
but
then
't
was
quite
out
of
the
key
,
and
*NL*
no
way
applicable
to
the
subject
started
;
--
so
that
with
all
their
*NL*
knowledge
,
they
could
not
tell
what
in
the
world
to
make
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Others
who
knew
nothing
of
musical
expression
,
and
merely
lent
their
*NL*
ears
to
the
plain
import
of
the
word
,
imagined
that
Phutatorius
,
who
was
*NL*
somewhat
of
a
cholerick
spirit
,
was
just
going
to
snatch
the
cudgels
out
*NL*
of
Didius
's
hands
,
in
order
to
bemaul
Yorick
to
some
purpose
--
and
that
*NL*
the
desperate
monosyllable
Z.
.
.
ds
was
the
exordium
to
an
oration
,
which
,
*NL*
as
they
judged
from
the
sample
,
presaged
but
a
rough
kind
of
handling
of
*NL*
him
;
so
that
my
uncle
Toby
's
good-nature
felt
a
pang
for
what
Yorick
was
*NL*
about
to
undergo
.
But
seeing
Phutatorius
stop
short
,
without
any
attempt
*NL*
or
desire
to
go
on
--
a
third
party
began
to
suppose
,
that
it
was
no
more
*NL*
than
an
involuntary
respiration
,
casually
forming
itself
into
the
shape
*NL*
of
a
twelve-penny
oath
--
without
the
sin
or
substance
of
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Others
,
and
especially
one
or
two
who
sat
next
him
,
looked
upon
it
on
*NL*
the
contrary
as
a
real
and
substantial
oath
,
propensly
formed
against
*NL*
Yorick
,
to
whom
he
was
known
to
bear
no
good
liking
--
which
said
oath
,
*NL*
as
my
father
philosophized
upon
it
,
actually
lay
fretting
and
fuming
at
*NL*
that
very
time
in
the
upper
regions
of
Phutatorius
's
purtenance
;
and
so
*NL*
was
naturally
,
and
according
to
the
due
course
of
things
,
first
squeezed
*NL*
out
by
the
sudden
influx
of
blood
which
was
driven
into
the
right
*NL*
ventricle
of
Phutatorius
's
heart
,
by
the
stroke
of
surprize
which
so
*NL*
strange
a
theory
of
preaching
had
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
finely
we
argue
upon
mistaken
facts
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
not
a
soul
busied
in
all
these
various
reasonings
upon
the
*NL*
monosyllable
which
Phutatorius
uttered
--
who
did
not
take
this
for
*NL*
granted
,
proceeding
upon
it
as
from
an
axiom
,
namely
,
that
Phutatorius
's
*NL*
mind
was
intent
upon
the
subject
of
debate
which
was
arising
between
*NL*
Didius
and
Yorick
;
and
indeed
as
he
looked
first
towards
the
one
and
*NL*
then
towards
the
other
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
listening
to
what
was
*NL*
going
forwards
--
who
would
not
have
thought
the
same
?
But
the
truth
*NL*
was
,
that
Phutatorius
knew
not
one
word
or
one
syllable
of
what
was
*NL*
passing
--
but
his
whole
thoughts
and
attention
were
taken
up
with
a
*NL*
transaction
which
was
going
forwards
at
that
very
instant
within
the
*NL*
precincts
of
his
own
Galligaskins
,
and
in
a
part
of
them
,
where
of
*NL*
all
others
he
stood
most
interested
to
watch
accidents
:
So
that
*NL*
notwithstanding
he
looked
with
all
the
attention
in
the
world
,
and
had
*NL*
gradually
skrewed
up
every
nerve
and
muscle
in
his
face
,
to
the
utmost
*NL*
pitch
the
instrument
would
bear
,
in
order
,
as
it
was
thought
,
to
give
a
*NL*
sharp
reply
to
Yorick
,
who
sat
over-against
him
--
yet
,
I
say
,
was
Yorick
*NL*
never
once
in
any
one
domicile
of
Phutatorius
's
brain
--
but
the
true
*NL*
cause
of
his
exclamation
lay
at
least
a
yard
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
I
will
endeavour
to
explain
to
you
with
all
imaginable
decency
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
must
be
informed
then
,
that
Gastripheres
,
who
had
taken
a
turn
into
*NL*
the
kitchen
a
little
before
dinner
,
to
see
how
things
went
on
--
observing
*NL*
a
wicker-basket
of
fine
chesnuts
standing
upon
the
dresser
,
had
ordered
*NL*
that
a
hundred
or
two
of
them
might
be
roasted
and
sent
in
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
dinner
was
over
--
Gastripheres
inforcing
his
orders
about
them
,
that
*NL*
Didius
,
but
Phutatorius
especially
,
were
particularly
fond
of
'em
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two
minutes
before
the
time
that
my
uncle
Toby
interrupted
*NL*
Yorick
's
harangue
--
Gastripheres
's
chesnuts
were
brought
in
--
and
as
*NL*
Phutatorius
's
fondness
for
'em
was
uppermost
in
the
waiter
's
head
,
he
*NL*
laid
them
directly
before
Phutatorius
,
wrapt
up
hot
in
a
clean
damask
*NL*
napkin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
whether
it
was
physically
impossible
,
with
half
a
dozen
hands
all
*NL*
thrust
into
the
napkin
at
a
time
--
but
that
some
one
chesnut
,
of
more
*NL*
life
and
rotundity
than
the
rest
,
must
be
put
in
motion
--
it
so
fell
*NL*
out
,
however
,
that
one
was
actually
sent
rolling
off
the
table
;
and
*NL*
as
Phutatorius
sat
straddling
under
--
it
fell
perpendicularly
into
that
*NL*
particular
aperture
of
Phutatorius
's
breeches
,
for
which
,
to
the
shame
*NL*
and
indelicacy
of
our
language
be
it
spoke
,
there
is
no
chaste
word
*NL*
throughout
all
Johnson
's
dictionary
--
let
it
suffice
to
say
--
it
was
that
*NL*
particular
aperture
which
,
in
all
good
societies
,
the
laws
of
decorum
*NL*
do
strictly
require
,
like
the
temple
of
Janus
-LRB-
in
peace
at
least
-RRB-
to
be
*NL*
universally
shut
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neglect
of
this
punctilio
in
Phutatorius
-LRB-
which
by-the-bye
should
be
*NL*
a
warning
to
all
mankind
-RRB-
had
opened
a
door
to
this
accident
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Accident
I
call
it
,
in
compliance
to
a
received
mode
of
speaking
--
but
*NL*
in
no
opposition
to
the
opinion
either
of
Acrites
or
Mythogeras
in
*NL*
this
matter
;
I
know
they
were
both
prepossessed
and
fully
persuaded
of
*NL*
it
--
and
are
so
to
this
hour
,
That
there
was
nothing
of
accident
in
the
*NL*
whole
event
--
but
that
the
chesnut
's
taking
that
particular
course
,
*NL*
and
in
a
manner
of
its
own
accord
--
and
then
falling
with
all
its
heat
*NL*
directly
into
that
one
particular
place
,
and
no
other
--
was
a
real
*NL*
judgment
upon
Phutatorius
for
that
filthy
and
obscene
treatise
de
*NL*
Concubinis
retinendis
,
which
Phutatorius
had
published
about
twenty
*NL*
years
ago
--
and
was
that
identical
week
going
to
give
the
world
a
second
*NL*
edition
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
my
business
to
dip
my
pen
in
this
controversy
--
much
*NL*
undoubtedly
may
be
wrote
on
both
sides
of
the
question
--
all
that
*NL*
concerns
me
as
an
historian
,
is
to
represent
the
matter
of
fact
,
and
*NL*
render
it
credible
to
the
reader
,
that
the
hiatus
in
Phutatorius
's
*NL*
breeches
was
sufficiently
wide
to
receive
the
chesnut
;
--
and
that
the
*NL*
chesnut
,
somehow
or
other
,
did
fall
perpendicularly
,
and
piping
hot
into
*NL*
it
,
without
Phutatorius
's
perceiving
it
,
or
any
one
else
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
genial
warmth
which
the
chesnut
imparted
,
was
not
undelectable
for
*NL*
the
first
twenty
or
five-and-twenty
seconds
--
and
did
no
more
than
*NL*
gently
solicit
Phutatorius
's
attention
towards
the
part
:
--
But
the
heat
*NL*
gradually
increasing
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
more
getting
beyond
the
*NL*
point
of
all
sober
pleasure
,
and
then
advancing
with
all
speed
into
the
*NL*
regions
of
pain
,
the
soul
of
Phutatorius
,
together
with
all
his
ideas
,
*NL*
his
thoughts
,
his
attention
,
his
imagination
,
judgment
,
resolution
,
*NL*
deliberation
,
ratiocination
,
memory
,
fancy
,
with
ten
battalions
of
*NL*
animal
spirits
,
all
tumultuously
crowded
down
,
through
different
defiles
*NL*
and
circuits
,
to
the
place
of
danger
,
leaving
all
his
upper
regions
,
as
*NL*
you
may
imagine
,
as
empty
as
my
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
best
intelligence
which
all
these
messengers
could
bring
him
*NL*
back
,
Phutatorius
was
not
able
to
dive
into
the
secret
of
what
was
going
*NL*
forwards
below
,
nor
could
he
make
any
kind
of
conjecture
,
what
the
devil
*NL*
was
the
matter
with
it
:
However
,
as
he
knew
not
what
the
true
cause
*NL*
might
turn
out
,
he
deemed
it
most
prudent
in
the
situation
he
was
in
at
*NL*
present
,
to
bear
it
,
if
possible
,
like
a
Stoick
;
which
,
with
the
help
*NL*
of
some
wry
faces
and
compursions
of
the
mouth
,
he
had
certainly
*NL*
accomplished
,
had
his
imagination
continued
neuter
;
--
but
the
sallies
*NL*
of
the
imagination
are
ungovernable
in
things
of
this
kind
--
a
thought
*NL*
instantly
darted
into
his
mind
,
that
tho
'
the
anguish
had
the
sensation
*NL*
of
glowing
heat
--
it
might
,
notwithstanding
that
,
be
a
bite
as
well
as
a
*NL*
burn
;
and
if
so
,
that
possibly
a
Newt
or
an
Asker
,
or
some
such
detested
*NL*
reptile
,
had
crept
up
,
and
was
fastening
his
teeth
--
the
horrid
idea
of
*NL*
which
,
with
a
fresh
glow
of
pain
arising
that
instant
from
the
chesnut
,
*NL*
seized
Phutatorius
with
a
sudden
panick
,
and
in
the
first
terrifying
*NL*
disorder
of
the
passion
,
it
threw
him
,
as
it
has
done
the
best
generals
*NL*
upon
earth
,
quite
off
his
guard
:
--
the
effect
of
which
was
this
,
that
*NL*
he
leapt
incontinently
up
,
uttering
as
he
rose
that
interjection
of
*NL*
surprise
so
much
descanted
upon
,
with
the
aposiopestic
break
after
it
,
*NL*
marked
thus
,
Z.
.
.
ds
--
which
,
though
not
strictly
canonical
,
was
still
*NL*
as
little
as
any
man
could
have
said
upon
the
occasion
;
--
and
which
,
*NL*
by-the-bye
,
whether
canonical
or
not
,
Phutatorius
could
no
more
help
*NL*
than
he
could
the
cause
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
this
has
taken
up
some
time
in
the
narrative
,
it
took
up
little
*NL*
more
time
in
the
transaction
,
than
just
to
allow
time
for
Phutatorius
*NL*
to
draw
forth
the
chesnut
,
and
throw
it
down
with
violence
upon
the
*NL*
floor
--
and
for
Yorick
to
rise
from
his
chair
,
and
pick
the
chesnut
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
curious
to
observe
the
triumph
of
slight
incidents
over
the
*NL*
mind
:
--
What
incredible
weight
they
have
in
forming
and
governing
our
*NL*
opinions
,
both
of
men
and
things
--
that
trifles
,
light
as
air
,
shall
*NL*
waft
a
belief
into
the
soul
,
and
plant
it
so
immoveably
within
it
--
that
*NL*
Euclid
's
demonstrations
,
could
they
be
brought
to
batter
it
in
breach
,
*NL*
should
not
all
have
power
to
overthrow
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yorick
,
I
said
,
picked
up
the
chesnut
which
Phutatorius
's
wrath
had
*NL*
flung
down
--
the
action
was
trifling
--
I
am
ashamed
to
account
for
it
--
he
*NL*
did
it
,
for
no
reason
,
but
that
he
thought
the
chesnut
not
a
jot
worse
*NL*
for
the
adventure
--
and
that
he
held
a
good
chesnut
worth
stooping
*NL*
for
.
--
But
this
incident
,
trifling
as
it
was
,
wrought
differently
in
*NL*
Phutatorius
's
head
:
He
considered
this
act
of
Yorick
's
in
getting
off
*NL*
his
chair
and
picking
up
the
chesnut
,
as
a
plain
acknowledgment
in
him
,
*NL*
that
the
chesnut
was
originally
his
--
and
in
course
,
that
it
must
have
*NL*
been
the
owner
of
the
chesnut
,
and
no
one
else
,
who
could
have
played
*NL*
him
such
a
prank
with
it
:
What
greatly
confirmed
him
in
this
opinion
,
*NL*
was
this
,
that
the
table
being
parallelogramical
and
very
narrow
,
it
*NL*
afforded
a
fair
opportunity
for
Yorick
,
who
sat
directly
over
against
*NL*
Phutatorius
,
of
slipping
the
chesnut
in
--
and
consequently
that
he
did
*NL*
it
.
The
look
of
something
more
than
suspicion
,
which
Phutatorius
cast
*NL*
full
upon
Yorick
as
these
thoughts
arose
,
too
evidently
spoke
his
*NL*
opinion
--
and
as
Phutatorius
was
naturally
supposed
to
know
more
of
the
*NL*
matter
than
any
person
besides
,
his
opinion
at
once
became
the
general
*NL*
one
;
--
and
for
a
reason
very
different
from
any
which
have
been
yet
*NL*
given
--
in
a
little
time
it
was
put
out
of
all
manner
of
dispute
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
great
or
unexpected
events
fall
out
upon
the
stage
of
this
*NL*
sublunary
world
--
the
mind
of
man
,
which
is
an
inquisitive
kind
of
a
*NL*
substance
,
naturally
takes
a
flight
behind
the
scenes
to
see
what
is
*NL*
the
cause
and
first
spring
of
them
.
--
The
search
was
not
long
in
this
*NL*
instance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
well
known
that
Yorick
had
never
a
good
opinion
of
the
treatise
*NL*
which
Phutatorius
had
wrote
de
Concubinis
retinendis
,
as
a
thing
which
*NL*
he
feared
had
done
hurt
in
the
world
--
and
't
was
easily
found
out
,
that
*NL*
there
was
a
mystical
meaning
in
Yorick
's
prank
--
and
that
his
chucking
*NL*
the
chesnut
hot
into
Phutatorius
's
...
--
...
,
was
a
sarcastical
fling
at
*NL*
his
book
--
the
doctrines
of
which
,
they
said
,
had
enflamed
many
an
honest
*NL*
man
in
the
same
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
conceit
awaken
'd
Somnolentus
--
made
Agelastes
smile
--
and
if
you
can
*NL*
recollect
the
precise
look
and
air
of
a
man
's
face
intent
in
finding
*NL*
out
a
riddle
--
it
threw
Gastripheres
's
into
that
form
--
and
in
short
was
*NL*
thought
by
many
to
be
a
master-stroke
of
arch-wit
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
as
the
reader
has
seen
from
one
end
to
the
other
,
was
as
*NL*
groundless
as
the
dreams
of
philosophy
:
Yorick
,
no
doubt
,
as
Shakespeare
*NL*
said
of
his
ancestor
--
`
was
a
man
of
jest
,
'
but
it
was
temper
'd
with
*NL*
something
which
withheld
him
from
that
,
and
many
other
ungracious
*NL*
pranks
,
of
which
he
as
undeservedly
bore
the
blame
;
--
but
it
was
his
*NL*
misfortune
all
his
life
long
to
bear
the
imputation
of
saying
and
doing
*NL*
a
thousand
things
,
of
which
-LRB-
unless
my
esteem
blinds
me
-RRB-
his
nature
was
*NL*
incapable
.
All
I
blame
him
for
--
or
rather
,
all
I
blame
and
alternately
*NL*
like
him
for
,
was
that
singularity
of
his
temper
,
which
would
never
*NL*
suffer
him
to
take
pains
to
set
a
story
right
with
the
world
,
however
in
*NL*
his
power
.
In
every
ill
usage
of
that
sort
,
he
acted
precisely
as
in
the
*NL*
affair
of
his
lean
horse
--
he
could
have
explained
it
to
his
honour
,
but
*NL*
his
spirit
was
above
it
;
and
besides
,
he
ever
looked
upon
the
inventor
,
*NL*
the
propagator
and
believer
of
an
illiberal
report
alike
so
injurious
*NL*
to
him
--
he
could
not
stoop
to
tell
his
story
to
them
--
and
so
trusted
to
*NL*
time
and
truth
to
do
it
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
heroic
cast
produced
him
inconveniences
in
many
respects
--
in
the
*NL*
present
it
was
followed
by
the
fixed
resentment
of
Phutatorius
,
who
,
*NL*
as
Yorick
had
just
made
an
end
of
his
chesnut
,
rose
up
from
his
chair
*NL*
a
second
time
,
to
let
him
know
it
--
which
indeed
he
did
with
a
smile
;
*NL*
saying
only
--
that
he
would
endeavour
not
to
forget
the
obligation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
you
must
mark
and
carefully
separate
and
distinguish
these
two
*NL*
things
in
your
mind
.
*NL*

The
smile
was
for

--
Can
you
tell
me
,
quoth
Phutatorius
,
speaking
to
Gastripheres
who
*NL*
sat
next
to
him
--
for
one
would
not
apply
to
a
surgeon
in
so
foolish
*NL*
an
affair
--
can
you
tell
me
,
Gastripheres
,
what
is
best
to
take
out
the
*NL*
fire
?
--
Ask
Eugenius
,
said
Gastripheres
.
--
That
greatly
depends
,
said
*NL*
Eugenius
,
pretending
ignorance
of
the
adventure
,
upon
the
nature
of
the
*NL*
part
--
If
it
is
a
tender
part
,
and
a
part
which
can
conveniently
be
wrapt
*NL*
up
--
It
is
both
the
one
and
the
other
,
replied
Phutatorius
,
laying
his
*NL*
hand
as
he
spoke
,
with
an
emphatical
nod
of
his
head
,
upon
the
part
*NL*
in
question
,
and
lifting
up
his
right
leg
at
the
same
time
to
ease
and
*NL*
ventilate
it
.
--
If
that
is
the
case
,
said
Eugenius
,
I
would
advise
you
,
*NL*
Phutatorius
,
not
to
tamper
with
it
by
any
means
;
but
if
you
will
send
to
*NL*
the
next
printer
,
and
trust
your
cure
to
such
a
simple
thing
as
a
soft
*NL*
sheet
of
paper
just
come
off
the
press
--
you
need
do
nothing
more
than
*NL*
twist
it
round
.
--
The
damp
paper
,
quoth
Yorick
-LRB-
who
sat
next
to
his
*NL*
friend
Eugenius
-RRB-
though
I
know
it
has
a
refreshing
coolness
in
it
--
yet
*NL*
I
presume
is
no
more
than
the
vehicle
--
and
that
the
oil
and
*NL*
lamp-black
with
which
the
paper
is
so
strongly
impregnated
,
does
the
*NL*
business
.
--
Right
,
said
Eugenius
,
and
is
,
of
any
outward
application
I
*NL*
would
venture
to
recommend
,
the
most
anodyne
and
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
my
case
,
said
Gastripheres
,
as
the
main
thing
is
the
oil
and
*NL*
lamp-black
,
I
should
spread
them
thick
upon
a
rag
,
and
clap
it
on
*NL*
directly
.
--
That
would
make
a
very
devil
of
it
,
replied
Yorick
.
--
And
*NL*
besides
,
added
Eugenius
,
it
would
not
answer
the
intention
,
which
is
*NL*
the
extreme
neatness
and
elegance
of
the
prescription
,
which
the
Faculty
*NL*
hold
to
be
half
in
half
;
--
for
consider
,
if
the
type
is
a
very
small
one
*NL*
-LRB-
which
it
should
be
-RRB-
the
sanative
particles
,
which
come
into
contact
in
*NL*
this
form
,
have
the
advantage
of
being
spread
so
infinitely
thin
,
and
*NL*
with
such
a
mathematical
equality
-LRB-
fresh
paragraphs
and
large
capitals
*NL*
excepted
-RRB-
as
no
art
or
management
of
the
spatula
can
come
up
to
.
--
It
*NL*
falls
out
very
luckily
,
replied
Phutatorius
,
that
the
second
edition
*NL*
of
my
treatise
de
Concubinis
retinendis
is

this
instant
in

You
may
take

said
Eugenius

Yorick

said
Yorick
;

a
respectful
bow
to

Phutatorius
as
he
spoke

I
think

Phutatorius

Now
,
quoth
Didius
,
rising
up
,
and
laying
his
right
hand
with
*NL*
his
fingers
spread
upon
his
breast
--
had
such
a
blunder
about
a
*NL*
christian-name
happened
before
the
Reformation
--
-LRB-
It
happened
the
day
*NL*
before
yesterday
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
to
himself
-RRB-
--
and
when
baptism
*NL*
was
administer
'd
in
Latin
--
-LRB-
'T
was
all
in
English
,
said
my
uncle
-RRB-
--
many
*NL*
things
might
have
coincided
with
it
,
and
upon
the
authority
of
sundry
*NL*
decreed
cases
,
to
have
pronounced
the
baptism
null
,
with
a
power
of
*NL*
giving
the
child
a
new
name
--
Had
a
priest
,
for
instance
,
which
was
no
*NL*
uncommon
thing
,
through
ignorance
of
the
Latin
tongue
,
baptized
a
child
*NL*
of
Tom-o'Stiles
,
in
nomine
patriae
&
filia
&
spiritum
sanctos
--
the
*NL*
baptism
was
held
null
.
--
I
beg
your
pardon
,
replied
Kysarcius
--
in
*NL*
that
case
,
as
the
mistake
was
only
the
terminations
,
the
baptism
was
*NL*
valid
--
and
to
have
rendered
it
null
,
the
blunder
of
the
priest
should
*NL*
have
fallen
upon
the
first
syllable
of
each
noun
--
and
not
,
as
in
your
*NL*
case
,
upon
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
delighted
in
subtleties
of
this
kind
,
and
listen
'd
with
*NL*
infinite
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gastripheres
,

example

Kysarcius

&
c.
&
c.
instead

Nomine

*NL*
&
c.
--
Is
this
a
baptism
?
No
--
say
the
ablest
canonists
;
in
as
much
as
the
*NL*
radix
of
each
word
is
hereby
torn
up
,
and
the
sense
and
meaning
of
them
*NL*
removed
and
changed
quite
to
another
object
;
for
Gomine
does
not
signify
*NL*
a
name
,
nor
gatris
a
father
.
--
What
do
they
signify
?
said
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
.
--
Nothing
at
all
--
quoth
Yorick
.
--
Ergo
,
such
a
baptism
is
null
,
said
*NL*
Kysarcius
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
In
course
,
answered
Yorick
,
in
a
tone
two
parts
jest
and
one
part
*NL*
earnest
.
--
But
in
the
case
cited
,
continued
Kysarcius
,
where
patriae
is
*NL*
put
for
patris
,
filia
for
filii
,
and
so
on
--
as
it
is
a
fault
only
in
*NL*
the
declension
,
and
the
roots
of
the
words
continue
untouch
'd
,
the
*NL*
inflections
of
their
branches
either
this
way
or
that
,
does
not
in
any
*NL*
sort
hinder
the
baptism
,
inasmuch
as
the
same
sense
continues
in
the
*NL*
words
as
before
.
--
But
then
,
said
Didius
,
the
intention
of
the
priest
's
*NL*
pronouncing
them
grammatically
must
have
been
proved
to
have
gone
along
*NL*
with
it
.
--
Right
,
answered
Kysarcius
;
and
of
this
,
brother
Didius
,
we
*NL*
have
an
instance
in
a
decree
of
the
decretals
of
Pope
Leo
the
IIId
.
--
But
*NL*
my
brother
's
child
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
*NL*
Pope
--
't
is
the
plain
child
of
a
Protestant
gentleman
,
christen
'd
*NL*
Tristram
against
the
wills
and

both
of
his
father
and
mother
,
and
*NL*
all
who
are
a-kin
to
it

--
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
wills
and
wishes

said
Kysarcius
,
interrupting
my
uncle
Toby
,
of
*NL*
those
only
who
stand
related
to
Mr.
Shandy
's
child
,
were
to
have

*NL*
in
this
matter
,
Mrs.
Shandy
,
of
all

,
has
the
least
to
do
in
*NL*
it

My
uncle
Toby
lay
'd
down
his
pipe
,
and
my
father
drew
his
chair
*NL*
still
closer
to
the

to
hear
the
conclusion
of
so
strange
an

,
under
colour
of
whispering
in

the

he

alarmed

he

not

My

gave

resumed

contenting
himself
with
whistling
Lillabullero
inwardly
--
Kysarcius
,
*NL*
Didius
,
and

went
on
with
the
discourse
as

:

*NL*
This
determination
,
continued
Kysarcius
,
how
contrary
soever
it
may
seem
*NL*
to
run
to
the
stream
of
vulgar
ideas
,
yet
had
reason
strongly
on
its
*NL*
side
;
and
has
been
put
out
of
all
manner
of
dispute
from
the
famous
*NL*
case
,
known
commonly
by
the
name
of
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
's
case
.
--
It
*NL*
is
cited
in

,
said
Triptolemus
--
And
taken
notice
of
by
Lord
Coke

added
Didius

--
And
you
may
find
it
in
Swinburn

said
*NL*
Kysarcius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
was
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
reign
of
Edward
the
Sixth
,
Charles
duke
of
Suffolk
having
issue
a
*NL*
son
by
one
venter
,
and
a
daughter
by
another
venter
,
made
his
last
will
,
*NL*
wherein
he
devised
goods
to
his
son
,
and
died
;
after
whose
death
the
son
*NL*
died
also
--
but
without
will
,
without
wife
,
and
without
child
--
his
mother
*NL*
and
his
sister
by
the
father
's
side
-LRB-
for
she
was
born
of
the
former
*NL*
venter
-RRB-
then
living
.
The
mother
took
the
administration
of
her
son
's
*NL*
goods
,
according
to
the
statute
of
the
21st
of
Harry
the
Eighth
,
whereby
*NL*
it
is
enacted
,
That
in
case
any
person
die
intestate
the
administration
*NL*
of
his
goods
shall
be
committed
to
the
next
of
kin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
administration
being
thus
-LRB-
surreptitiously
-RRB-
granted
to
the
*NL*
mother
,
the
sister
by
the
father
's
side
commenced
a
suit
before
the
*NL*
Ecclesiastical
Judge
,
alledging
,
1st
,
That
she
herself
was
next
of
kin
;
*NL*
and
2dly
,
That
the
mother
was
not
of
kin
at
all
to
the
party
deceased
;
*NL*
and
therefore
prayed
the
court
,
that
the
administration
granted
to
the
*NL*
mother
might
be
revoked
,
and
be
committed
unto
her
,
as
next
of
kin
to
*NL*
the
deceased
,
by
force
of
the
said
statute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hereupon
,
as
it
was
a
great
cause
,
and
much
depending
upon
its
*NL*
issue
--
and
many
causes
of
great
property
likely
to
be
decided
in
times
*NL*
to
come
,
by
the
precedent
to
be
then
made
--
the
most
learned
,
as
well
in
*NL*
the

of
this

,
as
in
the
civil
law
,
were
consulted
together
,
*NL*
whether
the
mother
was
of
kin
to
her
son
,
or
no
.
--
Whereunto
not
only

the
temporal
lawyers

*NL*
And
what
said

of

to
it
?
said
my

Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unexpectedness
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
question
,
confounded
Kysarcius
*NL*
more
than
the
ablest
advocate
--
He
stopp
'd
a
full
minute
,
looking
in
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
face
without
replying
--
and
in
that
single
minute
*NL*
Triptolemus
put
by
him
,
and
took
the
lead
as
follows
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
a
ground
and
principle
in
the
law
,
said
Triptolemus
,
that
things
do
*NL*
not
ascend
,
but
descend
in
it
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
't
is
for
this
cause
,
*NL*
that
however
true
it
is
,
that
the
child
may
be
of
the
blood
and
seed
of
*NL*
its
parents
--
that
the
parents
,
nevertheless
,
are
not
of
the
blood
and
*NL*
seed
of
it
;
inasmuch
as
the
parents
are
not
begot
by
the
child
,
but
the
*NL*
child
by
the
parents
--
For
so
they
write
,
Liberi
sunt
de
sanguine
patris
*NL*
&
matris
,
sed
pater
&
mater
non
sunt
de
sanguine
liberorum
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
this
,
Triptolemus
,
cried
Didius
,
proves
too
much
--
for
from
this
*NL*
authority
cited
it
would
follow
,
not
only
what
indeed
is
granted
on
*NL*
all
sides
,
that
the

There
you
push

cried

Didius
--
for
there
is
no

though
there
is
in
the
*NL*
Levitical
law
--
but
that
a

beget

in

case
,
supposing
the

cried
Kysarcius

of

Selden
speaks

not

his

which

is
this
said
affair
of
Tristram

at

settled
by

Very

replied
*NL*
Yorick
;
no
mortal
,
Sir
,
has
any
concern
with
it
--
for
Mrs.
Shandy
the
*NL*
mother
is
nothing
at
all
a-kin
to
him
--
and
as
the
mother
's
is
the
surest
*NL*
side
--
Mr.
Shandy
,
in
course
is
still
less
than
nothing
--
In
short
,
he
is
*NL*
not
as
much
a-kin
to
him

Sir
,
as
I
am

may

*NL*
Though
my
father
was
hugely
tickled
with
the
subtleties
of
these
learned
*NL*
discourses
--
't
was
still
but
like
the
anointing
of
a
broken
bone
--
The
*NL*
moment
he
got
home
,
the
weight
of
his
afflictions
returned
upon
him
but
*NL*
so
much
the
heavier
,
as
is
ever
the
case
when
the
staff
we
lean
on
*NL*
slips
from
under
us
.
--
He
became
pensive
--
walked
frequently
forth
to
*NL*
the
fish-pond
--
let
down
one
loop
of
his
hat
--
sigh
'd
often
--
forbore
to
*NL*
snap
--
and
,
as
the
hasty
sparks
of
temper
,
which
occasion
snapping
,
so
*NL*
much
assist
perspiration
and
digestion
,
as
Hippocrates
tells
us
--
he
had
*NL*
certainly
fallen
ill
with
the
extinction
of
them
,
had
not
his
thoughts
*NL*
been
critically
drawn
off
,
and
his
health
rescued
by
a
fresh
train
of
*NL*
disquietudes
left
him
,
with
a
legacy
of
a
thousand
pounds
,
by
my
aunt
*NL*
Dinah
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
had
scarce
read
the
letter
,
when
taking
the
thing
by
the
right
*NL*
end
,
he
instantly
began
to
plague
and
puzzle
his
head
how
to
lay
it
out
*NL*
mostly
to
the
honour
of
his
family
.
--
A
hundred-and-fifty
odd
projects
*NL*
took
possession
of
his
brains
by
turns
--
he
would
do
this
,
and
that
and
*NL*
t
`
other
--
He
would
go
to
Rome
--
he
would
go
to
law
--
he
would
buy
stock
--
he
*NL*
would
buy
John
Hobson
's
farm
--
he
would
new
fore
front
his
house
,
and
add
*NL*
a
new
wing
to
make
it
even
--
There
was
a
fine
water-mill
on
this
side
,
*NL*
and
he
would
build
a
wind-mill
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
in
full
*NL*
view
to
answer
it
--
But
above
all
things
in
the
world
,
he
would
inclose
*NL*
the
great
Ox-moor
,
and
send
out
my
brother
Bobby
immediately
upon
his
*NL*
travels
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
the
sum
was
finite
,
and
consequently
could
not
do
every
*NL*
thing
--
and
in
truth
very
few
of
these
to
any
purpose
--
of
all
the
*NL*
projects
which
offered
themselves
upon
this
occasion
,
the
two
last
*NL*
seemed
to
make
the
deepest
impression
;
and
he
would
infallibly
have
*NL*
determined
upon
both
at
once
,
but
for
the
small
inconvenience
hinted
at
*NL*
above
,
which
absolutely
put
him
under
a
necessity
of
deciding
in
favour
*NL*
either
of
the
one
or
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
altogether
so
easy
to
be
done
;
for
though
't
is
certain
*NL*
my
father
had
long
before
set
his
heart
upon
this
necessary
part
of
my
*NL*
brother
's
education
,
and
like
a
prudent
man
had
actually
determined
to
*NL*
carry
it
into
execution
,
with
the
first
money
that
returned
from
the
*NL*
second
creation
of
actions
in
the
Missisippi-scheme
,
in
which
he
was
an
*NL*
adventurer
--
yet
the
Ox-moor
,
which
was
a
fine
,
large
,
whinny
,
undrained
,
*NL*
unimproved
common
,
belonging
to
the
Shandy-estate
,
had
almost
as
old
*NL*
a
claim
upon
him
:
he
had
long
and
affectionately
set
his
heart
upon
*NL*
turning
it
likewise
to
some
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
having
never
hitherto
been
pressed
with
such
a
conjuncture
of
*NL*
things
,
as
made
it
necessary
to
settle
either
the
priority
or
justice
of
*NL*
their
claims
--
like
a
wise
man
he
had
refrained
entering
into
any
nice
*NL*
or
critical
examination
about
them
:
so
that
upon
the
dismission
of
every
*NL*
other
project
at
this
crisis
--
the
two
old
projects
,
the
Ox-moor
and
*NL*
my
Brother
,
divided
him
again
;
and
so
equal
a
match
were
they
for
*NL*
each
other
,
as
to
become
the
occasion
of
no
small
contest
in
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
's
mind
--
which
of
the
two
should
be
set
o'going
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
People
may
laugh
as
they
will
--
but
the
case
was
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
ever
been
the
custom
of
the
family
,
and
by
length
of
time
was
*NL*
almost
become
a
matter
of
common
right
,
that
the
eldest
son
of
it
*NL*
should
have
free
ingress
,
egress
,
and
regress
into
foreign
parts
before
*NL*
marriage
--
not
only
for
the
sake
of
bettering
his
own
private
parts
,
by
*NL*
the
benefit
of
exercise
and
change
of
so
much
air
--
but
simply
for
the
*NL*
mere
delectation
of
his
fancy
,
by
the
feather
put
into
his
cap
,
of
*NL*
having
been
abroad
--
tantum
valet
,
my
father
would
say
,
quantum
sonat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
as
this
was
a
reasonable
,
and
in
course
a
most
christian
*NL*
indulgence
--
to
deprive
him
of
it
,
without
why
or
wherefore
--
and
thereby
*NL*
make
an
example
of
him
,
as
the
first
Shandy
unwhirl
'd
about
Europe
in
a
*NL*
post-chaise
,
and
only
because
he
was
a
heavy
lad
--
would
be
using
him
ten
*NL*
times
worse
than
a
Turk
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
the
case
of
the
Ox-moor
was
full
as
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Exclusive
of
the
original
purchase-money
,
which
was
eight
hundred
*NL*
pounds
--
it
had
cost
the
family
eight
hundred
pounds
more
in
a
law-suit
*NL*
about
fifteen
years
before
--
besides
the
Lord
knows
what
trouble
and
*NL*
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
moreover
in
possession
of
the
Shandy-family
ever
since
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
last
century
;
and
though
it
lay
full
in
view
before
the
*NL*
house
,
bounded
on
one
extremity
by
the
water-mill
,
and
on
the
other
*NL*
by
the
projected
wind-mill
spoken
of
above
--
and
for
all
these
reasons
*NL*
seemed
to
have
the
fairest
title
of
any
part
of
the
estate
to
the
care
*NL*
and
protection
of
the
family
--
yet
by
an
unaccountable
fatality
,
common
*NL*
to
men
,
as
well
as
the
ground
they
tread
on
--
it
had
all
along
most
*NL*
shamefully
been
overlook
'd
;
and
to
speak
the
truth
of
it
,
had
suffered
*NL*
so
much
by
it
,
that
it
would
have
made
any
man
's
heart
have
bled
*NL*
-LRB-
Obadiah
said
-RRB-
who
understood
the
value
of
the
land
,
to
have
rode
over
*NL*
it
,
and
only
seen
the
condition
it
was
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
neither
the
purchasing
this
tract
of
ground
--
nor
indeed
the
*NL*
placing
of
it
where
it
lay
,
were
either
of
them
,
properly
speaking
,
of
*NL*
my
father
's
doing
--
he
had
never
thought
himself
any
way
concerned
in
*NL*
the
affair
--
till
the
fifteen
years
before
,
when
the
breaking
out
of
*NL*
that
cursed
law-suit
mentioned
above
-LRB-
and
which
had
arose
about
its
*NL*
boundaries
-RRB-
--
which
being
altogether
my
father
's
own
act
and
deed
,
it
*NL*
naturally
awakened
every
other
argument
in
its
favour
,
and
upon
summing
*NL*
them
all
up
together
,
he
saw
,
not
merely
in
interest
,
but
in
honour
,
he
*NL*
was
bound
to
do
something
for
it
--
and
that
now
or
never
was
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
there
must
certainly
have
been
a
mixture
of
ill-luck
in
it
,
that
*NL*
the
reasons
on
both
sides
should
happen
to
be
so
equally
balanced
*NL*
by
each
other
;
for
though
my
father
weigh
'd
them
in
all
humours
*NL*
and
conditions
--
spent
many
an
anxious
hour
in
the
most
profound
and
*NL*
abstracted
meditation
upon
what
was
best
to
be
done
--
reading
books
of
*NL*
farming
one
day
--
books
of
travels
another
--
laying
aside
all
passion
*NL*
whatever
--
viewing
the
arguments
on
both
sides
in
all
their
lights
and
*NL*
circumstances
--
communing
every
day
with
my
uncle
Toby
--
arguing
*NL*
with
Yorick
,
and
talking
over
the
whole
affair
of
the
Ox-moor
with
*NL*
Obadiah
--
yet
nothing
in
all
that
time
appeared
so
strongly
in
behalf
of
*NL*
the
one
,
which
was
not
either
strictly
applicable
to
the
other
,
or
at
*NL*
least
so
far
counterbalanced
by
some
consideration
of
equal
weight
,
as
*NL*
to
keep
the
scales
even
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
to
be
sure
,
with
proper
helps
,
in
the
hands
of
some
people
,
tho
'
the
*NL*
Ox-moor
would
undoubtedly
have
made
a
different
appearance
in
the
world
*NL*
from
what
it
did
,
or
ever
could
do
in
the
condition
it
lay
--
yet
every
*NL*
tittle
of
this
was
true
,
with
regard
to
my
brother
Bobby
--
let
Obadiah
*NL*
say
what
he
would
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
In
point
of
interest
--
the
contest
,
I
own
,
at
first
sight
,
did
not
appear
*NL*
so
undecisive
betwixt
them
;
for
whenever
my
father
took
pen
and
ink
*NL*
in
hand
,
and
set
about
calculating
the
simple
expence
of
paring
and
*NL*
burning
,
and
fencing
in
the
Ox-moor
,
&
c.
&
c.
--
with
the
certain
profit
it
*NL*
would
bring
him
in
return
--
the
latter
turned
out
so
prodigiously
in
his
*NL*
way
of
working
the
account
,
that
you
would
have
sworn
the
Ox-moor
would
*NL*
have
carried
all
before
it
.
For
it
was
plain
he
should
reap
a
hundred
*NL*
lasts
of
rape
,
at
twenty
pounds
a
last
,
the
very
first
year
--
besides
an
*NL*
excellent
crop
of
wheat
the
year
following
--
and
the
year
after
that
,
*NL*
to
speak
within
bounds
,
a
hundred
--
but
in
all
likelihood
,
a
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
--
if
not
two
hundred
quarters
of
pease
and
beans
--
besides
potatoes
*NL*
without
end
.
--
But
then
,
to
think
he
was
all
this
while
breeding
up
my
*NL*
brother
,
like
a
hog
to
eat
them
--
knocked
all
on
the
head
again
,
and
*NL*
generally
left
the
old
gentleman
in
such
a
state
of
suspense
--
that
,
as
*NL*
he
often
declared
to
my
uncle
Toby
--
he
knew
no
more
than
his
heels
what
*NL*
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
body
,
but
he
who
has
felt
it
,
can
conceive
what
a
plaguing
thing
it
*NL*
is
to
have
a
man
's
mind
torn
asunder
by
two
projects
of
equal
strength
,
*NL*
both
obstinately
pulling
in
a
contrary
direction
at
the
same
time
:
*NL*
for
to
say
nothing
of
the
havock
,
which
by
a
certain
consequence
is
*NL*
unavoidably
made
by
it
all
over
the
finer
system
of
the
nerves
,
which
*NL*
you
know
convey
the
animal
spirits
and
more
subtle
juices
from
the
heart
*NL*
to
the
head
,
and
so
on
--
it
is
not
to
be
told
in
what
a
degree
such
a
*NL*
wayward
kind
of
friction
works
upon
the
more
gross
and
solid
parts
,
*NL*
wasting
the
fat
and
impairing
the
strength
of
a
man
every
time
as
it
*NL*
goes
backwards
and
forwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
had
certainly
sunk
under
this
evil
,
as
certainly
as
he
had
*NL*
done
under
that
of
my
Christian
Name
--
had
he
not
been
rescued
out
of
*NL*
it
,
as
he
was
out
of
that
,
by
a
fresh
evil
--
the
misfortune
of
my
brother
*NL*
Bobby
's
death
.
*NL*

What
is
the
life
of
man

Is
it
not
to
shift
from
side
to
side
?
--
from
*NL*
sorrow
to
sorrow

--
to
button
up
one
cause
of
vexation

and
unbutton
*NL*
another
?

am
to
be
considered
as
heir-apparent
to
the
Shandy
*NL*
family
--
and
it
is
from
this
point
properly
,
that
the
story
of
my
Life
*NL*
and
my
Opinions
sets
out
.
With
all
my
hurry
and
precipitation
,
I
have
*NL*
but
been
clearing
the
ground
to
raise
the
building
--
and
such
a
building
*NL*
do
I
foresee
it
will
turn
out
,
as
never
was
planned
,
and
as
never
was
*NL*
executed
since
Adam
.
In
less
than
five
minutes
I
shall
have
thrown
*NL*
my
pen
into
the
fire
,
and
the
little
drop
of
thick
ink
which
is
left
*NL*
remaining
at
the
bottom
of
my
ink-horn
,
after
it
--
I
have
but
half
a
*NL*
score
things
to
do
in
the
time
--
I
have
a
thing
to
name
--
a
thing
to
*NL*
lament
--
a
thing
to
hope
--
a
thing
to
promise
,
and
a
thing
to
threaten
--
I
*NL*
have
a
thing
to
suppose
--
a
thing
to
declare
--
a
thing
to
conceal
--
a
thing
*NL*
to
choose
,
and
a
thing
to
pray
for
--
This
chapter
,
therefore
,
I
name
the
*NL*
chapter
of
Things
--
and
my
next
chapter
to
it
,
that
is
,
the
first
chapter
*NL*
of
my
next
volume
,
if
I
live
,
shall
be
my
chapter
upon
Whiskers
,
in
*NL*
order
to
keep
up
some
sort
of
connection
in
my
works
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thing
I
lament
is
,
that
things
have
crowded
in
so
thick
upon
me
,
*NL*
that
I
have
not
been
able
to
get
into
that
part
of
my
work
,
towards
*NL*
which
I
have
all
the
way
looked
forwards
,
with
so
much
earnest
desire
;
*NL*
and
that
is
the
Campaigns
,
but
especially
the
amours
of
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
the
events
of
which
are
of
so
singular
a
nature
,
and
so
Cervantick
a
*NL*
cast
,
that
if
I
can
so
manage
it
,
as
to
convey
but
the
same
impressions
*NL*
to
every
other
brain
,
which
the
occurrences
themselves
excite
in
my
*NL*
own
--
I
will
answer
for
it
the
book
shall
make
its
way
in
the
world
,
much
*NL*
better
than
its
master
has
done
before
it
.
--
Oh
Tristram
!
Tristram
!
can
*NL*
this
but
be
once
brought
about
--
the
credit
,
which
will
attend
thee
as
an
*NL*
author
,
shall
counterbalance
the
many
evils
will
have
befallen
thee
as
*NL*
a
man
--
thou
wilt
feast
upon
the
one
--
when
thou
hast
lost
all
sense
and
*NL*
remembrance
of
the
other
--
!
*NL*
*NL*
No
wonder
I
itch
so
much
as
I
do
,
to
get
at
these
amours
--
They
are
the
*NL*
choicest
morsel
of
my
whole
story
!
and
when
I
do
get
at
'em
--
assure
*NL*
yourselves
,
good
folks
--
-LRB-
nor
do
I
value
whose
squeamish
stomach
*NL*
takes
offence
at
it
-RRB-
I
shall
not
be
at
all
nice
in
the
choice
of
my
*NL*
words
!
--
and
that
's
the
thing
I
have
to
declare
.
--
I
shall
never
get
all
*NL*
through
in
five
minutes
,
that
I
fear
--
and
the
thing
I
hope
is
,
that
your
*NL*
worships
and
reverences
are
not
offended
--
if
you
are
,
depend
upo
n't
I
'll
*NL*
give
you
something
,
my
good
gentry
,
next
year
to
be
offended
at
--
that
's
*NL*
my
dear
Jenny
's
way
--
but
who
my
Jenny
is
--
and
which
is
the
right
and
*NL*
which
the
wrong
end
of
a
woman
,
is
the
thing
to
be
concealed
--
it
*NL*
shall
be
told
you
in
the
next
chapter
but
one
to
my
chapter
of
*NL*
Button-holes
--
and
not
one
chapter
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
that
you
have
just
got
to
the
end
of
these
-LRB-
According
to
the
*NL*
preceding
Editions
.
-RRB-
three
volumes
--
the
thing
I
have
to
ask
is
,
how
you
*NL*
feel
your
heads
?
my
own
akes
dismally
!
--
as
for
your
healths
,
I
know
,
*NL*
they
are
much
better
.
--
True
Shandeism
,
think
what
you
will
against
it
,
*NL*
opens
the
heart
and
lungs
,
and
like
all
those
affections
which
partake
*NL*
of
its
nature
,
it
forces
the
blood
and
other
vital
fluids
of
the
body
*NL*
to
run
freely
through
its
channels
,
makes
the
wheel
of
life
run
long
and
*NL*
cheerfully
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
I
left
,
like
Sancho
Panca
,
to
choose
my
kingdom
,
it
should
not
be
*NL*
maritime
--
or
a
kingdom
of
blacks
to
make
a
penny
of
;
--
no
,
it
should
be
*NL*
a
kingdom
of
hearty
laughing
subjects
:
And
as
the
bilious
and
more
*NL*
saturnine
passions
,
by
creating
disorders
in
the
blood
and
humours
,
have
*NL*
as
bad
an
influence
,
I
see
,
upon
the
body
politick
as
body
natural
--
and
*NL*
as
nothing
but
a
habit
of
virtue
can
fully
govern
those
passions
,
and
*NL*
subject
them
to
reason
--
I
should
add
to
my
prayer
--
that
God
would
give
*NL*
my
subjects
grace
to
be
as
Wise
as
they
were
Merry
;
and
then
should
I
be
*NL*
the
happiest
monarch
,
and
they
are
the
happiest
people
under
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
with
this
moral
for
the
present
,
may
it
please
your
worships
and
*NL*
your
reverences
,
I
take
my
leave
of
you
till
this
time
twelve-month
,
*NL*
when
,
-LRB-
unless
this
vile
cough
kills
me
in
the
mean
time
-RRB-
I
'll
have
*NL*
another
pluck
at
your
beards
,
and
lay
open
a
story
to
the

you
*NL*
little
dream
of

offer
you
these

;
they
are

with

*NL*

I

produce
:

had

liberty
I
take
of

inscribing
the

of

for

I

If
it
had
not
been
for
those
two
mettlesome
tits
,
and
that
madcap
of
*NL*
a
postillion
who
drove
them
from
Stilton
to
Stamford
,
the
thought
had
*NL*
never
entered
my
head
.
He
flew
like
lightning
--
there
was
a
slope
of
*NL*
three
miles
and
a
half
--
we
scarce
touched
the
ground
--
the
motion
was
*NL*
most
rapid
--
most
impetuous
--
't
was
communicated
to
my
brain
--
my
heart
*NL*
partook
of
it
--
`
By
the
great
God
of
day
,
'
said
I
,
looking
towards
the
*NL*
sun
,
and
thrusting
my
arm
out
of
the
fore-window
of
the
chaise
,
as
I
*NL*
made
my
vow
,
'
I
will
lock
up
my
study-door
the
moment
I
get
home
,
and
*NL*
throw
the
key
of
it
ninety
feet
below
the
surface
of
the
earth
,
into
the
*NL*
draw-well
at
the
back
of
my
house
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
London
waggon
confirmed
me
in
my
resolution
;
it
hung
tottering
*NL*
upon
the
hill
,
scarce
progressive
,
drag
'd
--
drag
'd
up
by
eight
heavy
*NL*
beasts
--
`
by
main
strength
!
--
quoth
I
,
nodding
--
but
your
betters
draw
the
*NL*
same
way
--
and
something
of
every
body
's
!
--
O
rare
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Tell
me
,
ye
learned
,
shall
we
for
ever
be
adding
so
much
to
the
bulk
--
so
*NL*
little
to
the
stock
?
*NL*
*NL*
Shall
we
for
ever
make
new
books
,
as
apothecaries
make
new
mixtures
,
by
*NL*
pouring
only
out
of
one
vessel
into
another
?
*NL*
*NL*
Are
we
for
ever
to
be
twisting
,
and
untwisting
the
same
rope
?
for
ever
*NL*
in
the
same
track
--
for
ever
at
the
same
pace
?
*NL*
*NL*
Shall
we
be
destined
to
the
days
of
eternity
,
on
holy-days
,
as
well
as
*NL*
working-days
,
to
be
shewing
the
relicks
of
learning
,
as
monks
do
the
*NL*
relicks
of
their
saints
--
without
working
one
--
one
single
miracle
with
*NL*
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
Who
made
Man
,
with
powers
which
dart
him
from
earth
to
heaven
in
a
*NL*
moment
--
that
great
,
that
most
excellent
,
and
most
noble
creature
of
the
*NL*
world
--
the
miracle
of
nature
,
as
Zoroaster
in
his
book
-LRB-
Greek
-RRB-
called
*NL*
him
--
the
Shekinah
of
the
divine
presence
,
as
Chrysostom
--
the
image
of
*NL*
God
,
as
Moses
--
the
ray
of
divinity
,
as
Plato
--
the
marvel
of
marvels
,
*NL*
as
Aristotle
--
to
go
sneaking
on
at
this
pitiful
--
pimping
--
pettifogging
*NL*
rate
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
scorn
to
be
as
abusive
as
Horace
upon
the
occasion
--
but
if
there
is
*NL*
no
catachresis
in
the
wish
,
and
no
sin
in
it
,
I
wish
from
my
soul
,
that
*NL*
every
imitator
in
Great
Britain
,
France
,
and
Ireland
,
had
the
farcy
for
*NL*
his
pains
;
and
that
there
was
a
good
farcical
house
,
large
enough
to
*NL*
hold
--
aye
--
and
sublimate
them
,
shag
rag
and
bob-tail
,
male
and
female
,
*NL*
all
together
:
and
this
leads
me
to
the
affair
of
Whiskers
--
but
,
by
what
*NL*
chain
of
ideas
--
I
leave
as
a
legacy
in
mort-main
to
Prudes
and
Tartufs
,
*NL*
to
enjoy
and
make
the
most
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
Whiskers
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
'm
sorry
I
made
it
--
't
was
as
inconsiderate
a
promise
as
ever
entered
*NL*
a
man
's
head
--
A
chapter
upon
whiskers
!
alas
!
the
world
will
not
*NL*
bear
it
--
't
is
a
delicate
world
--
but
I
knew
not
of
what
mettle
it
was
*NL*
made
--
nor
had
I
ever
seen
the
under-written
fragment
;
otherwise
,
as
*NL*
surely
as
noses
are
noses
,
and
whiskers
are
whiskers
still
-LRB-
let
the
*NL*
world
say
what
it
will
to
the
contrary
-RRB-
;
so
surely
would
I
have
steered
*NL*
clear
of
this
dangerous
chapter
.

*NL*
The
Fragment
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
--
You
are
half
asleep
,
my
good
lady
,
said
the
old
gentleman
,
taking
*NL*
hold
of
the
old
lady
's
hand
,
and
giving
it
a
gentle
squeeze
,
as
he
*NL*
pronounced
the
word
Whiskers
--
shall
we
change
the
subject
?
By
no
means
,
*NL*
replied
the
old
lady
--
I
like
your
account
of
those
matters
;
so
throwing
*NL*
a
thin
gauze
handkerchief
over
her
head
,
and
leaning
it
back
upon
the
*NL*
chair
with
her
face
turned
towards
him
,
and
advancing
her
two
feet
as
*NL*
she
reclined
herself
--
I
desire
,
continued
she
,
you
will
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
went
on
as
follows
:
--
Whiskers
!
cried
the
queen
*NL*
of
Navarre
,
dropping
her
knotting
ball
,
as
La
Fosseuse
uttered
the
*NL*
word
--
Whiskers
,
madam
,
said
La
Fosseuse
,
pinning
the
ball
to
the
queen
's
*NL*
apron
,
and
making
a
courtesy
as
she
repeated
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
La
Fosseuse
's
voice
was
naturally
soft
and
low
,
yet
't
was
an
articulate
*NL*
voice
:
and
every
letter
of
the
word
Whiskers
fell
distinctly
upon
the
*NL*
queen
of
Navarre
's
ear
--
Whiskers
!
cried
the
queen
,
laying
a
greater
*NL*
stress
upon
the
word
,
and
as
if
she
had
still
distrusted
her
*NL*
ears
--
Whiskers
!
replied
La
Fosseuse
,
repeating
the
word
a
third
*NL*
time
--
There
is
not
a
cavalier
,
madam
,
of
his
age
in
Navarre
,
continued
*NL*
the
maid
of
honour
,
pressing
the
page
's
interest
upon
the
queen
,
that
*NL*
has
so
gallant
a
pair
--
Of
what
?
cried
Margaret
,
smiling
--
Of
whiskers
,
*NL*
said
La
Fosseuse
,
with
infinite
modesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
Whiskers
still
stood
its
ground
,
and
continued
to
be
made
*NL*
use
of
in
most
of
the
best
companies
throughout
the
little
kingdom
of
*NL*
Navarre
,
notwithstanding
the
indiscreet
use
which
La
Fosseuse
had
made
*NL*
of
it
:
the
truth
was
,
La
Fosseuse
had
pronounced
the
word
,
not
only
*NL*
before
the
queen
,
but
upon
sundry
other
occasions
at
court
,
with
an
*NL*
accent
which
always
implied
something
of
a
mystery
--
And
as
the
court
*NL*
of
Margaret
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
was
at
that
time
a
mixture
of
*NL*
gallantry
and
devotion
--
and
whiskers
being
as
applicable
to
the
one
,
as
*NL*
the
other
,
the
word
naturally
stood
its
ground
--
it
gained
full
as
much
*NL*
as
it
lost
;
that
is
,
the
clergy
were
for
it
--
the
laity
were
against
*NL*
it
--
and
for
the
women
,
--
they
were
divided
.

was
*NL*
at
that
time
beginning
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
maids
of
honour
*NL*
towards
the
terrace
before
the
palace
gate
,
where
the
guard
was
mounted
.
*NL*
The
lady
De
Baussiere
fell
deeply
in
love
with
him
,
--
La
Battarelle
did
*NL*
the
same
--
it
was
the
finest
weather
for
it
,
that
ever
was
remembered
*NL*
in
Navarre
--
La
Guyol
,
La
Maronette
,
La
Sabatiere
,
fell
in
love
with
the
*NL*
Sieur
De
Croix
also
--
La
Rebours
and
La
Fosseuse
knew
better
--
De
Croix
*NL*
had
failed
in
an
attempt
to
recommend
himself
to
La
Rebours
;
and
La
*NL*
Rebours
and
La
Fosseuse
were
inseparable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
of
Navarre
was
sitting
with
her
ladies
in
the
painted
*NL*
bow-window
,
facing
the
gate
of
the
second
court
,
as
De
Croix
passed
*NL*
through
it
--
He
is
handsome
,
said
the
Lady
Baussiere
--
He
has
a
good
mien
,
*NL*
said
La
Battarelle
--
He
is
finely
shaped
,
said
La
Guyol
--
I
never
saw
an
*NL*
officer
of
the
horse-guards
in
my
life
,
said
La
Maronette
,
with
two
such
*NL*
legs
--
Or
who
stood
so
well
upon
them
,
said
La
Sabatiere
--
But
he
has
no
*NL*
whiskers
,
cried
La
Fosseuse
--
Not
a
pile
,
said
La
Rebours
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
queen
went
directly
to
her
oratory
,
musing
all
the
way
,
as
she
*NL*
walked
through
the
gallery
,
upon
the
subject
;
turning
it
this
way
and
*NL*
that
way
in
her
fancy
--
Ave
Maria
!
--
what
can
La-Fosseuse
mean
?
said
she
,
*NL*
kneeling
down
upon
the
cushion
.
*NL*
*NL*
La
Guyol
,
La
Battarelle
,
La
Maronette
,
La
Sabatiere
,
retired
instantly
*NL*
to
their
chambers
--
Whiskers

said
all
four
of
them
to
themselves
,
as
*NL*
they
bolted
their
doors
on
the
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Lady
Carnavallette
was
counting
her
beads
with
both
hands
,
*NL*
unsuspected
,
under
her
farthingal
--
from
St.
Antony
down
to
St.
Ursula
*NL*
inclusive
,
not
a
saint
passed
through
her
fingers
without
whiskers
;
*NL*
St.
Francis
,
St.
Dominick
,
St.
Bennet
,
St.
Basil

St.

had
all

*NL*
The
Lady
Baussiere
had
got
into
a
wilderness
of
conceits
,
with
*NL*
moralizing
too
intricately
upon
La
Fosseuse
's
text
--
She
mounted
her
*NL*
palfrey
,
her

followed
her

the

the

Baussiere
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
One

the

one

in

of

a

Pity

a

hoary-headed

meekly
*NL*
holding
up
a

begirt
with

in

an

I

said
the

Baussiere
--
The

took
hold
of

her
palfrey

She
dismounted
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
some
trains
of
certain
ideas
which
leave
prints
of
themselves
*NL*
about
our
eyes
and
eye-brows
;
and
there
is
a
consciousness
of
it
,
*NL*
somewhere
about
the
heart
,
which
serves
but
to
make
these

the
*NL*
stronger

cried

looking
close

Ho

La

*NL*
the

Carnavallette

bewhisker
'd
St.

*NL*
*NL*
La
Fosseuse
drew
her
bodkin
from
the
knot
of
her
hair
,
and
having
traced
*NL*
the
outline
of
a
small
whisker
,
with
the
blunt
end
of
it
,
upon
one
side
*NL*
of
her
upper

The
Lady
Baussiere
coughed
thrice
into
the
inside
of
her
muff
--
La
Guyol
*NL*
smiled
--
Fy
,
said
the
Lady
Baussiere
.
The
queen
of
Navarre
touched
her
*NL*
eye
with
the
tip
of
her
fore-finger
--
as
much
as
to
say
,
I
understand
you
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
plain
to
the
whole
court
the
word
was
ruined
:
La
Fosseuse
had
*NL*
given
it
a
wound
,
and
it
was
not
the
better
for
passing
through
all
*NL*
these
defiles
--
It
made
a
faint
stand
,
however
,
for
a
few
months
,
by
the
*NL*
expiration
of
which
,
the
Sieur
De
Croix
,
finding
it
high
time
to
leave
*NL*
Navarre
for
want
of
whiskers
--
the
word
in
course
became
indecent
,
and
*NL*
-LRB-
after
a
few
efforts
-RRB-
absolutely
unfit
for
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
best
word
,
in
the
best
language
of
the
best
world
,
must
have
*NL*
suffered
under
such
combinations
.
--
The
curate
of
d'Estella
wrote
a
book
*NL*
against
them
,
setting
forth
the
dangers
of
accessory
ideas
,
and
warning
*NL*
the
Navarois
against
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Does
not
all
the
world
know
,
said
the
curate
d'Estella
at
the
conclusion
*NL*
of
his
work
,
that
Noses
ran
the
same
fate
some
centuries
ago
in
*NL*
most
parts
of
Europe
,
which
Whiskers
have
now
done
in
the
kingdom
of
*NL*
Navarre
?
--
The
evil
indeed
spread
no
farther
then
--
but
have
not
beds
*NL*
and
bolsters
,
and
night-caps
and
chamber-pots
stood
upon
the
brink
*NL*
of
destruction
ever
since
?
Are
not
trouse
,
and
placket-holes
,
and
*NL*
pump-handles
--
and
spigots
and
faucets
,
in
danger
still
from
the
same
*NL*
association
?
--
Chastity
,
by
nature
,
the
gentlest
of
all
affections
--
give
*NL*
it
but
its
head
--
't
is
like
a
ramping
and
a
roaring
lion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drift
of
the
curate
d'Estella
's
argument
was
not
understood
.
--
They
*NL*
ran
the
scent
the
wrong
way
.
--
The
world
bridled
his
ass
at
the
*NL*
tail
.
--
And
when
the
extremes
of
Delicacy
,
and
the
beginnings
of
*NL*
Concupiscence
,
hold
their
next
provincial
chapter
together
,
they
may
*NL*
decree
that
bawdy
also
.

*NL*
When
my
father
received
the
letter
which
brought
him
the
melancholy
*NL*
account
of
my
brother
Bobby
's
death
,
he
was
busy
calculating
the
expence
*NL*
of
his
riding
post
from
Calais
to
Paris
,
and
so
on
to
Lyons
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
a
most
inauspicious
journey
;
my
father
having
had
every
foot
of
it
*NL*
to
travel
over
again
,
and
his
calculation
to
begin
afresh
,
when
he
had
*NL*
almost
got
to
the
end
of
it
,
by
Obadiah
's
opening
the
door
to
acquaint
*NL*
him
the
family
was
out
of
yeast
--
and
to
ask
whether
he
might
not
*NL*
take
the
great
coach-horse
early
in
the
morning
and
ride
in
search
*NL*
of
some
.
--
With
all
my
heart
,
Obadiah
,
said
my
father
-LRB-
pursuing
his
*NL*
journey
-RRB-
--
take
the
coach-horse
,
and
welcome
.
--
But
he
wants
a
shoe
,
poor
*NL*
creature
!
said
Obadiah
.
--
Poor
creature
!
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
vibrating
*NL*
the
note
back
again
,
like
a
string
in
unison
.
Then
ride
the
Scotch
*NL*
horse
,
quoth
my
father
hastily
.
--
He
can
not
bear
a
saddle
upon
his
back
,
*NL*
quoth
Obadiah
,
for
the
whole
world
.
--
The
devil
's
in
that
horse
;
then
*NL*
take
Patriot
,
cried
my
father
,
and
shut
the
door
.
--
Patriot
is
sold
,
said
*NL*
Obadiah
.
Here
's
for
you
!
cried
my
father
,
making
a
pause
,
and
looking
*NL*
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
face
,
as
if
the
thing
had
not
been
a
matter
*NL*
of
fact
.
--
Your
worship
ordered
me
to
sell
him
last
April
,
said
*NL*
Obadiah
.
--
Then
go
on
foot
for
your
pains
,
cried
my
father
--
I
had
much
*NL*
rather
walk
than
ride
,
said
Obadiah
,
shutting
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
plagues
,
cried
my
father
,
going
on
with
his
calculation
.
--
But
the
*NL*
waters
are
out
,
said
Obadiah
,
--
opening
the
door
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Till
that
moment
,
my
father
,
who
had
a
map
of
Sanson
's
,
and
a
book
*NL*
of
the
post-roads
before
him
,
had
kept
his
hand
upon
the
head
of
his
*NL*
compasses
,
with
one
foot
of
them
fixed
upon
Nevers
,
the
last
stage
he
*NL*
had
paid
for
--
purposing
to
go
on
from
that
point
with
his
journey
and
*NL*
calculation
,
as
soon
as
Obadiah
quitted
the
room
:
but
this
second
attack
*NL*
of
Obadiah
's
,
in
opening
the
door
and
laying
the
whole
country
under
*NL*
water
,
was
too
much
.
--
He
let
go
his
compasses
--
or
rather
with
a
mixed
*NL*
motion
between
accident
and
anger
,
he
threw
them
upon
the
table
;
and
*NL*
then
there
was
nothing
for
him
to
do
,
but
to
return
back
to
Calais
-LRB-
like
*NL*
many
others
-RRB-
as
wise
as
he
had
set
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
letter
was
brought
into
the
parlour
,
which
contained
the
news
*NL*
of
my
brother
's
death
,
my
father
had
got
forwards
again
upon
his
*NL*
journey
to
within
a
stride
of
the
compasses
of
the
very
same
stage
of
*NL*
Nevers
.
--
By
your
leave
,
Mons
.
Sanson
,
cried
my
father
,
striking
the
*NL*
point
of
his
compasses
through
Nevers
into
the
table
--
and
nodding
to
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
to
see
what
was
in
the
letter
--
twice
of
one
night
,
is
too
*NL*
much
for
an
English
gentleman
and
his
son
,
Mons
.
Sanson
,
to
be
turned
*NL*
back
from
so
lousy
a
town
as
Nevers
--
What
think
`
st
thou
,
Toby
?
added
my
*NL*
father
in
a
sprightly
tone
.
--
Unless
it
be
a
garrison
town
,
said
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
--
for
then
--
I
shall
be
a
fool
,
said
my
father
,
smiling
to
himself
,
*NL*
as
long
as
I
live
.
--
So
giving
a
second
nod
--
and
keeping
his
compasses
*NL*
still
upon
Nevers
with
one
hand
,
and
holding
his
book
of
the
post-roads
*NL*
in
the
other
--
half
calculating
and
half
listening
,
he
leaned
forwards
*NL*
upon
the
table
with
both
elbows
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
hummed
over
the
*NL*
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
he
's
gone
!
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
Where
--
Who
?
cried
my
father
.
--
My
*NL*
nephew
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
What
--
without
leave
--
without
money
--
without
*NL*
governor
?
cried
my
father
in
amazement
.
No
:
--
he
is
dead
,
my
dear
*NL*
brother
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
Without
being
ill
?
cried
my
father
*NL*
again
.
--
I
dare
say
not
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
a
low
voice
,
and
fetching
*NL*
a
deep
sigh
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
,
he
has
been
ill
enough
,
poor
*NL*
lad
!
I
'll
answer
for
him
--
for
he
is
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Agrippina
was
told
of
her
son
's
death
,
Tacitus
informs
us
,
that
,
*NL*
not
being
able
to
moderate
the
violence
of
her
passions
,
she
abruptly
*NL*
broke
off
her
work
--
My
father
stuck
his
compasses
into
Nevers
,
but
*NL*
so
much
the
faster
.
--
What
contrarieties
!
his
,
indeed
,
was
matter
of
*NL*
calculation
!
--
Agrippina
's
must
have
been
quite
a
different
affair
;
who
*NL*
else
could
pretend
to
reason
from
history
?
*NL*
*NL*
How
my
father
went
on
,
in
my
opinion
,
deserves
a
chapter
to
itself
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
3

III
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
--
And
a
chapter
it
shall
have
,
and
a
devil
of
a
one
too
--
so
look
to
*NL*
yourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
either
Plato
,
or
Plutarch
,
or
Seneca
,
or
Xenophon
,
or
Epictetus
,
*NL*
or
Theophrastus
,
or
Lucian
--
or
some
one
perhaps
of
later
date
--
either
*NL*
Cardan
,
or
Budaeus
,
or
Petrarch
,
or
Stella
--
or
possibly
it
may
be
some
*NL*
divine
or
father
of
the
church
,
St.
Austin
,
or
St.
Cyprian
,
or
Barnard
,
*NL*
who
affirms
that
it
is
an
irresistible
and
natural
passion
to
weep
for
*NL*
the
loss
of
our
friends
or
children
--
and
Seneca
-LRB-
I
'm
positive
-RRB-
tells
us
*NL*
somewhere
,
that
such
griefs
evacuate
themselves
best
by
that
particular
*NL*
channel
--
And
accordingly
we
find
,
that
David
wept
for
his
son
*NL*
Absalom
--
Adrian
for
his
Antinous
--
Niobe
for
her
children
,
and
that
*NL*
Apollodorus
and
Crito
both
shed
tears
for
Socrates
before
his
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
managed
his
affliction
otherwise
;
and
indeed
differently
from
*NL*
most
men
either
ancient
or
modern
;
for
he
neither
wept
it
away
,
as
the
*NL*
Hebrews
and
the
Romans
--
or
slept
it
off
,
as
the
Laplanders
--
or
hanged
*NL*
it
,
as
the
English
,
or
drowned
it
,
as
the
Germans
,
--
nor
did
he
curse
it
,
*NL*
or
damn
it
,
or
excommunicate
it
,
or
rhyme
it
,
or
lillabullero
it
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
got
rid
of
it
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
your
worships
give
me
leave
to
squeeze
in
a
story
between
these
two
*NL*
pages
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
Tully
was
bereft
of
his
dear
daughter
Tullia
,
at
first
he
laid
it
*NL*
to
his
heart
,
--
he
listened
to
the
voice
of
nature
,
and
modulated
his
*NL*
own
unto
it
.
--
O
my
Tullia
!
my
daughter
!
my
child
!
--
still
,
still
,
*NL*
still
,
--
't
was
O
my
Tullia
!
--
my
Tullia
!
Methinks
I
see
my
Tullia
,
I
hear
*NL*
my
Tullia
,
I
talk
with
my
Tullia
.
--
But
as
soon
as
he
began
to
look
into
*NL*
the
stores
of
philosophy
,
and
consider
how
many
excellent
things
might
*NL*
be
said
upon
the
occasion
--
no
body
upon
earth
can
conceive
,
says
the
*NL*
great
orator
,
how
happy
,
how
joyful
it
made
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
was
as
proud
of
his
eloquence
as
Marcus
Tullius
Cicero
could
*NL*
be
for
his
life
,
and
,
for
aught
I
am
convinced
of
to
the
contrary
*NL*
at
present
,
with
as
much
reason
:
it
was
indeed
his
strength
--
and
his
*NL*
weakness
too
.
--
His
strength
--
for
he
was
by
nature
eloquent
;
and
his
*NL*
weakness
--
for
he
was
hourly
a
dupe
to
it
;
and
,
provided
an
occasion
*NL*
in
life
would
but
permit
him
to
shew
his
talents
,
or
say
either
a
*NL*
wise
thing
,
a
witty
,
or
a
shrewd
one
--
-LRB-
bating
the
case
of
a
systematic
*NL*
misfortune
-RRB-
--
he
had
all
he
wanted
.
--
A
blessing
which
tied
up
my
father
's
*NL*
tongue
,
and
a
misfortune
which
let
it
loose
with
a
good
grace
,
were
*NL*
pretty
equal
:
sometimes
,
indeed
,
the
misfortune
was
the
better
of
the
*NL*
two
;
for
instance
,
where
the
pleasure
of
the
harangue
was
as
ten
,
and
*NL*
the
pain
of
the
misfortune
but
as
five
--
my
father
gained
half
in
half
,
*NL*
and
consequently
was
as
well
again
off
,
as
if
it
had
never
befallen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
clue
will
unravel
what
otherwise
would
seem
very
inconsistent
in
my
*NL*
father
's
domestic
character
;
and
it
is
this
,
that
,
in
the
provocations
*NL*
arising
from
the
neglects
and
blunders
of
servants
,
or
other
mishaps
*NL*
unavoidable
in
a
family
,
his
anger
,
or
rather
the
duration
of
it
,
*NL*
eternally
ran
counter
to
all
conjecture
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
had
a
favourite
little
mare
,
which
he
had
consigned
over
to
a
*NL*
most
beautiful
Arabian
horse
,
in
order
to
have
a
pad
out
of
her
for
his
*NL*
own
riding
:
he
was
sanguine
in
all
his
projects
;
so
talked
about
his
*NL*
pad
every
day
with
as
absolute
a
security
,
as
if
it
had
been
reared
,
*NL*
broke
,
--
and
bridled
and
saddled
at
his
door
ready
for
mounting
.
By
*NL*
some
neglect
or
other
in
Obadiah
,
it
so
fell
out
,
that
my
father
's
*NL*
expectations
were
answered
with
nothing
better
than
a
mule
,
and
as
ugly
*NL*
a
beast
of
the
kind
as
ever
was
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
and
my
uncle
Toby
expected
my
father
would
be
the
death
of
*NL*
Obadiah
--
and
that
there
never
would
be
an
end
of
the
disaster
--
See
*NL*
here
!
you
rascal
,
cried
my
father
,
pointing
to
the
mule
,
what
you
have
*NL*
done
!
--
It
was
not
me
,
said
Obadiah
.
--
How
do
I
know
that
?
replied
my
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Triumph
swam
in
my
father
's
eyes
,
at
the
repartee
--
the
Attic
salt
*NL*
brought
water
into
them
--
and
so
Obadiah
heard
no
more
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
let
us
go
back
to
my
brother
's
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philosophy
has
a
fine
saying
for
every
thing
.
--
For
Death
it
has
an
*NL*
entire
set
;
the
misery
was
,
they
all
at
once
rushed
into
my
father
's
*NL*
head
,
that
't
was
difficult
to
string
them
together
,
so
as
to
make
any
*NL*
thing
of
a
consistent
show
out
of
them
.

He
took
them
as
they
came
.

my

If

My

'T

said
my

But
is
it
not
nonsense
to
break
the

thread
of
such
a
discourse
upon

an

cried
my

he
,
taking

by

do
not

beseech
thee
,

me
at

My

Toby
put
his
pipe
*NL*
into
his

.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Where

Troy

--
continued
my
father
,
taking
up
his
book
of
post-roads
,
*NL*
which
he
had
laid
down
.
--
`
What
is
become
,
brother
Toby
,
of
Nineveh

*NL*
Babylon

of

and
Mitylenae

The

that
ever
the

are
now
no

the

are
left

Returning
out

when
I
sailed
from
Aegina
towards
Megara
,
'
-LRB-
when

can
this
have

thought
my
uncle
Toby
,
-RRB-
'
I
began
to
view
the
country
*NL*
round
about

Aegina
was
behind
me
,
Megara
was
before

Pyraeus
on
the
*NL*
right

Corinth
on

left
.
--
What
flourishing
towns
now
prostrate
*NL*
upon

Alas
!
alas

said
I
to
myself
,
that
man
should
disturb
*NL*
his
soul
for
the
loss
of
a
child
,
when
so
much
as
this
lies
awfully
*NL*
buried
in

Remember

said
I
to
myself
again
--
remember
thou
*NL*
art

*NL*
*NL*
Now
my
uncle
Toby
knew
not
that
this
last
paragraph
was
an
extract
*NL*
of
Servius
Sulpicius
's
consolatory
letter
to
Tully
.
--
He
had
as
little
*NL*
skill
,
honest
man
,
in
the
fragments
,
as
he
had
in
the
whole
pieces
of
*NL*
antiquity
.
--
And
as
my
father
,
whilst
he
was
concerned
in
the
Turkey
*NL*
trade
,
had
been
three
or
four
different
times
in
the
Levant
,
in
one
*NL*
of
which
he
had
stayed
a
whole
year
and
an
half
at
Zant
,
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
naturally
concluded
,
that
,
in
some
one
of
these
periods
,
he
had
taken
a
*NL*
trip
across
the
Archipelago
into
Asia
;
and
that
all
this
sailing
affair
*NL*
with
Aegina
behind
,
and
Megara
before
,
and
Pyraeus
on
the
right
hand
,
*NL*
&
c.
&
c.
was
nothing
more
than
the
true
course
of
my
father
's
voyage
and
*NL*
reflections
.
--
'T
was
certainly
in
his
manner
,
and
many
an
undertaking
*NL*
critic
would
have
built
two
stories
higher
upon
worse
foundations
.
--
And
*NL*
pray
,
brother
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
laying
the
end
of
his
pipe
upon
*NL*
my
father
's
hand
in
a
kindly
way
of
interruption
--
but
waiting
till
he
*NL*
finished
the
account
--
what
year
of
our
Lord
was
this
?
--
'T
was
no
year
*NL*
of
our
Lord
,
replied
my
father
.
--
That
's
impossible
,
cried
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
.
--
Simpleton
!
said
my
father
,
--
't
was
forty
years
before
Christ
was
*NL*
born

*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
had
but
two
things
for
it
;
either
to
suppose
his
brother
*NL*
to
be
the
wandering
Jew
,
or
that
his
misfortunes
had
disordered
his
*NL*
brain
.
--
`
May
the
Lord
God
of
heaven

earth
protect
him

him

said
my

praying
silently
for
my
father
,
and
with
tears
*NL*
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*

My

placed
the
tears
to
a
proper
account

went
on
with
his
*NL*
harangue
with
great
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There

great
odds

my

is
no
terrour

in
its
looks

what
it
borrows

from
groans

Better

smiling

absolutely
forgot

laid
down

consider
the
proposition

my

eloquence
was
too
rapid

stay

along

My
mother
was
going
very
gingerly
in
the
dark
along
the
passage
which
*NL*
led
to
the
parlour
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
pronounced
the
word
wife
.
--
'T
is
a
*NL*
shrill
penetrating
sound
of
itself
,
and
Obadiah
had
helped
it
by
leaving
*NL*
the
door
a
little
a-jar
,
so
that
my
mother
heard
enough
of
it
to
imagine
*NL*
herself
the
subject
of
the
conversation
;
so
laying
the
edge
of
her
*NL*
finger
across
her
two
lips
--
holding
in
her
breath
,
and
bending
her
head
*NL*
a
little
downwards
,
with
a
twist
of
her
neck
--
-LRB-
not
towards
the
door
,
but
*NL*
from
it
,
by
which
means
her
ear
was
brought
to
the
chink
-RRB-
--
she
listened
*NL*
with
all
her
powers
:
--
the
listening
slave
,
with
the
Goddess
of
Silence
*NL*
at
his
back
,
could
not
have
given
a
finer
thought
for
an
intaglio
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
attitude
I
am
determined
to
let
her
stand
for
five
minutes
:
*NL*
till
I
bring
up
the
affairs
of

does

*NL*
Though
in
one
sense
,
our
family
was
certainly
a
simple
machine
,
as
it
*NL*
consisted
of
a
few
wheels
;
yet
there
was
thus
much
to
be
said
for
it
,
*NL*
that
these
wheels
were
set
in
motion
by
so
many
different
springs
,
and
*NL*
acted
one
upon
the
other
from
such
a
variety
of
strange
principles
and
*NL*
impulses
--
that
though
it
was
a
simple
machine
,
it
had
all
the
honour
and
*NL*
advantages
of
a
complex
one
,
--
and
a
number
of
as
odd
movements
within
*NL*
it
,
as
ever
were
beheld
in
the
inside
of
a
Dutch
silk-mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amongst
these
there
was
one
,
I
am
going
to
speak
of
,
in
which
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
it
was
not
altogether
so
singular
,
as
in
many
others
;
and
it
was
*NL*
this
,
that
whatever
motion
,
debate
,
harangue
,
dialogue
,
project
,
or
*NL*
dissertation
,
was
going
forwards
in
the
parlour
,
there
was
generally
*NL*
another
at
the
same
time
,
and
upon
the
same
subject
,
running
parallel
*NL*
along
with
it
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
to
bring
this
about
,
whenever
an
extraordinary
message
,
or
letter
,
*NL*
was
delivered
in
the
parlour
--
or
a
discourse
suspended
till
a
servant
*NL*
went
out
--
or
the
lines
of
discontent
were
observed
to
hang
upon
the
*NL*
brows
of
my
father
or
mother
--
or
,
in
short
,
when
any
thing
was
supposed
*NL*
to
be
upon
the
tapis
worth
knowing
or
listening
to
,
't
was
the
rule
to
*NL*
leave
the
door
,
not
absolutely
shut
,
but
somewhat
a-jar
--
as
it
stands
*NL*
just
now
,
--
which
,
under
covert
of
the
bad
hinge
,
-LRB-
and
that
possibly
*NL*
might
be
one
of
the
many
reasons
why
it
was
never
mended
,
-RRB-
it
was
not
*NL*
difficult
to
manage
;
by
which
means
,
in
all
these
cases
,
a
passage
was
*NL*
generally
left
,
not
indeed
as
wide
as
the
Dardanelles
,
but
wide
enough
,
*NL*
for
all
that
,
to
carry
on
as
much
of
this
windward
trade
,
as
was
*NL*
sufficient
to
save
my
father
the
trouble
of
governing
his
house
;
--
my
*NL*
mother
at
this
moment
stands
profiting
by
it
.
--
Obadiah
did
the
same
*NL*
thing
,
as
soon
as
he
had
left
the
letter
upon
the
table
which
brought
*NL*
the
news
of
my
brother
's
death
,
so
that
before
my
father
had
well
got
*NL*
over
his
surprise
,
and
entered
upon
his
harangue
,
--
had
Trim
got
upon
his
*NL*
legs
,
to
speak
his
sentiments
upon
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
curious
observer
of
nature
,
had
he
been
worth
the
inventory
of
all
*NL*
Job
's
stock
--
though
by
the
bye
,
your
curious
observers
are
seldom
worth
*NL*
a
groat
--
would
have
given
the
half
of
it
,
to
have
heard
Corporal
Trim
*NL*
and
my
father
,
two
orators
so
contrasted
by
nature
and
education
,
*NL*
haranguing
over
the
same
bier
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
--
a
man
of
deep
reading
--
prompt
memory
--
with
Cato
,
and
Seneca
,
*NL*
and
Epictetus
,
at
his
fingers
ends
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
--
with
nothing
--
to
remember
--
of
no
deeper
reading
than
his
*NL*
muster-roll
--
or
greater
names
at
his
fingers
end
,
than
the
contents
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
proceeding
from
period
to
period
,
by
metaphor
and
allusion
,
and
*NL*
striking
the
fancy
as
he
went
along
-LRB-
as
men
of
wit
and
fancy
do
-RRB-
with
*NL*
the
entertainment
and
pleasantry
of
his
pictures
and
images
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
,
without
wit
or
antithesis
,
or
point
,
or
turn
,
this
way
or
*NL*
that
;
but
leaving
the
images
on
one
side
,
and
the
picture
on
the
other
,
*NL*
going
straight
forwards
as
nature
could
lead
him
,
to
the
heart
.
O
Trim
!
*NL*
would
to
heaven
thou
had
`

a

historian

thy

*NL*
--
My
young
master
in
London
is
dead
?
said
Obadiah
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
green
sattin
night-gown
of
my
mother
's
,
which
had
been
twice
*NL*
scoured
,
was
the
first
idea
which
Obadiah
's
exclamation
brought
*NL*
into
Susannah
's
head
.
--
Well
might
Locke
write
a
chapter
upon
the
*NL*
imperfections
of
words
.
--
Then
,
quoth
Susannah
,
we
must
all
go
into
*NL*
mourning
.
--
But
note
a
second
time
:
the
word
mourning
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
Susannah
made
use
of
it
herself
--
failed
also
of
doing
its
office
;
it
*NL*
excited
not
one
single
idea
,
tinged
either
with
grey
or
black
,
--
all
was
*NL*
green
.
--
The
green
sattin
night-gown
hung
there
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
!
`
twill
be
the
death
of
my
poor
mistress
,
cried
Susannah
.
--
My
*NL*
mother
's
whole
wardrobe
followed
.
--
What
a
procession
!
her
red
*NL*
damask
,
--
her
orange
tawney
,
--
her
white
and
yellow
lutestrings
,
--
her
*NL*
brown
taffata
,
--
her
bone-laced
caps
,
her
bed-gowns
,
and
comfortable
*NL*
under-petticoats
.
--
Not
a
rag
was
left
behind
.
--
`
No
,
--
she
will
never
look
*NL*
up
again
,
'
said
Susannah
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
a
fat
,
foolish
scullion
--
my
father
,
I
think
,
kept
her
for
her
*NL*
simplicity
;
--
she
had
been
all
autumn
struggling
with
a
dropsy
.
--
He
*NL*
is
dead
,
said
Obadiah
,
--
he
is
certainly
dead
!
--
So
am
not
I
,
said
the
*NL*
foolish
scullion
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Here
is
sad
news
,
Trim
,
cried
Susannah
,
wiping
her
eyes
as
Trim
*NL*
stepp
'd
into
the
kitchen
,
--
master
Bobby
is
dead
and
buried
--
the
funeral
*NL*
was
an
interpolation
of
Susannah
's
--
we
shall
have
all
to
go
into
*NL*
mourning
,
said
Susannah
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hope
not
,
said
Trim
.
--
You
hope
not
!
cried
Susannah
earnestly
.
--
The
*NL*
mourning
ran
not
in
Trim
's
head
,
whatever
it
did
in
Susannah
's
.
--
I
*NL*
hope
--
said
Trim
,
explaining
himself
,
I
hope
in
God
the
news
is
not
true
.
*NL*
I
heard
the
letter
read
with
my
own
ears
,
answered
Obadiah
;
and
we
shall
*NL*
have
a
terrible
piece
of
work
of
it
in
stubbing
the
ox-moor
.
--
Oh
!
he
's
*NL*
dead
,
said
Susannah
.
--
As
sure
,
said
the
scullion
,
as
I
'm
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lament
for
him
from
my
heart
and
my
soul
,
said
Trim
,
fetching
a
*NL*
sigh
.
--
Poor
creature
!
--
poor
boy
!
--
poor
gentleman
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
was
alive
last
Whitsontide
!
said
the
coachman
.
--
Whitsontide
!
alas
!
*NL*
cried
Trim
,
extending
his
right
arm
,
and
falling
instantly
into
the
same
*NL*
attitude
in
which
he
read
the
sermon
,
--
what
is
Whitsontide
,
Jonathan
*NL*
-LRB-
for
that
was
the
coachman
's
name
-RRB-
,
or
Shrovetide
,
or
any
tide
or
time
*NL*
past
,
to
this
?
Are
we
not
here
now
,
continued
the
corporal
-LRB-
striking
the
*NL*
end
of
his
stick
perpendicularly
upon
the
floor
,
so
as
to
give
an
idea
*NL*
of
health
and
stability
-RRB-
--
and
are
we
not
--
-LRB-
dropping
his
hat
upon
the
*NL*
ground
-RRB-
gone
!
in
a
moment
!
--
'T
was
infinitely
striking
!
Susannah
burst
*NL*
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
--
We
are
not
stocks
and
stones
.
--
Jonathan
,
*NL*
Obadiah
,
the
cook-maid
,
all
melted
.
--
The
foolish
fat
scullion
herself
,
*NL*
who
was
scouring
a
fish-kettle
upon
her
knees
,
was
rous
'd
with
it
.
--
The
*NL*
whole
kitchen
crowded
about
the
corporal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
as
I
perceive
plainly
,
that
the
preservation
of
our
constitution
in
*NL*
church
and
state
,
--
and
possibly
the
preservation
of
the
whole
world
--
or
*NL*
what
is
the
same
thing
,
the
distribution
and
balance
of
its
property
and
*NL*
power
,
may
in
time
to
come
depend
greatly
upon
the
right
understanding
*NL*
of
this
stroke
of
the
corporal
's
eloquence
--
I
do
demand
your
*NL*
attention
--
your
worships
and
reverences
,
for
any
ten
pages
together
,
*NL*
take
them
where
you
will
in
any
other
part
of
the
work
,
shall
sleep
for
*NL*
it
at
your
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
,
`
we
were
not
stocks
and
stones
'
--
't
is
very
well
.
I
should
have
*NL*
added
,
nor
are
we
angels
,
I
wish
we
were
,
--
but
men
clothed
with
bodies
,
*NL*
and
governed
by
our
imaginations
;
--
and
what
a
junketing
piece
of
work
*NL*
of
it
there
is
,
betwixt
these
and
our
seven
senses
,
especially
some
of
*NL*
them
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
own
it
,
I
am
ashamed
to
confess
.
Let
it
suffice
*NL*
to
affirm
,
that
of
all
the
senses
,
the
eye
-LRB-
for
I
absolutely
deny
the
*NL*
touch
,
though
most
of
your
Barbati
,
I
know
,
are
for
it
-RRB-
has
the
quickest
*NL*
commerce
with
the
soul
,
--
gives
a
smarter
stroke
,
and
leaves
something
*NL*
more
inexpressible
upon
the
fancy
,
than
words
can
either
convey
--
or
*NL*
sometimes
get
rid
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
've
gone
a
little
about
--
no
matter
,
't
is
for
health
--
let
us
only
*NL*
carry
it
back
in
our
mind
to
the
mortality
of
Trim
's
hat
--
`
Are
we
*NL*
not
here
now
,
--
and
gone
in
a
moment
?
'
--
There
was
nothing
in
the
*NL*
sentence
--
't
was
one
of
your
self-evident
truths
we
have
the
advantage
of
*NL*
hearing
every
day
;
and
if
Trim
had
not
trusted
more
to
his
hat
than
his
*NL*
head
--
he
made
nothing
at
all
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
`
Are
we
not
here
now
;
'
continued
the
corporal
,
`
and
are
we
*NL*
not
'
--
-LRB-
dropping
his
hat
plumb
upon
the
ground
--
and
pausing
,
before
he
*NL*
pronounced
the
word
-RRB-
--
`
gone
!
in
a
moment
?
'
The
descent
of
the
hat
was
as
*NL*
if
a
heavy
lump
of
clay
had
been
kneaded
into
the
crown
of
it
.
--
Nothing
*NL*
could
have
expressed
the
sentiment
of
mortality
,
of
which
it
was
the
*NL*
type
and
fore-runner
,
like
it
,
--
his
hand
seemed
to
vanish
from
under
*NL*
it
,
--
it
fell
dead
,
--
the
corporal
's
eye
fixed
upon
it
,
as
upon
a
*NL*
corpse
,
--
and
Susannah
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
--
Ten
thousand
,
and
ten
thousand
times
ten
thousand
-LRB-
for
matter
and
*NL*
motion
are
infinite
-RRB-
are
the
ways
by
which
a
hat
may
be
dropped
upon
the
*NL*
ground
,
without
any
effect
.
--
Had
he
flung
it
,
or
thrown
it
,
or
cast
it
,
*NL*
or
skimmed
it
,
or
squirted
it
,
or
let
it
slip
or
fall
in
any
possible
*NL*
direction
under
heaven
,
--
or
in
the
best
direction
that
could
be
given
*NL*
to
it
,
--
had
he
dropped
it
like
a
goose
--
like
a
puppy
--
like
an
ass
--
or
in
*NL*
doing
it
,
or
even

had

looked
like

like

ninny

like

it
had
fail
'd

been
lost

I
have
a
small
account
to
settle
with

before

go

--
I
own
myself
a
debtor
to
the
world
for
two
items
,
--
a
chapter
upon
*NL*
chamber-maids
and
button-holes
,
which
,
in
the
former
part
of
my
work
,
*NL*
I
promised
and
fully
intended
to
pay
off
this
year
:
but
some
of
your
*NL*
worships
and
reverences
telling
me
,
that
the
two
subjects
,
especially
so
*NL*
connected
together
,
might
endanger
the
morals
of
the
world
,
--
I
pray
the
*NL*
chapter
upon
chamber-maids
and
button-holes
may
be
forgiven
me
,
--
and
*NL*
that
they
will
accept
of
the
last
chapter
in
lieu
of
it
;
which
is
*NL*
nothing
,
a
n't
please
your
reverences
,
but
a
chapter
of
chamber-maids
,
*NL*
green
gowns

and

hats

Trim
took
his

off

put

To
us
,
Jonathan
,
who
know
not
what
want
or
care
is
--
who
live
here
in
*NL*
the
service
of
two
of
the
best
of
masters
--
-LRB-
bating
in
my
own
case
his
*NL*
majesty
King
William
the
Third
,
whom
I
had
the
honour
to
serve
both
in
*NL*
Ireland
and
Flanders
-RRB-
--
I
own
it
,
that
from
Whitsontide
to
within
three
*NL*
weeks
of
Christmas
,
--
't
is
not
long
--
't
is
like
nothing
;

but
to
those
,
*NL*
Jonathan
,
who
know
what
death
is
,
and
what
havock
and
destruction
he
*NL*
can
make
,
before
a
man
can
well
wheel
about
--
't
is
like
a
whole
age
.
--
O
*NL*
Jonathan
!
`
twould
make
a
good-natured
man
's
heart
bleed
,
to
consider
,
*NL*
continued
the
corporal
-LRB-
standing
perpendicularly
-RRB-
,
how
low
many
a
brave
*NL*
and
upright
fellow
has
been
laid
since
that
time
!
--
And
trust
me
,
Susy
,
*NL*
added
the
corporal
,
turning
to
Susannah
,
whose
eyes
were
swimming
in
*NL*
water
,
--
before
that
time
comes
round
again
,
--
many
a
bright
eye
will
be
*NL*
dim
.
--
Susannah
placed
it
to
the
right
side
of
the
page
--
she
wept
--
but
*NL*
she
court
`
sied
too
.
--
Are
we
not
,
continued
Trim
,
looking
still
at
*NL*
Susannah
--
are
we
not
like
a
flower
of
the
field
--
a
tear
of
pride
stole
*NL*
in
betwixt
every
two
tears
of
humiliation
--
else
no
tongue
could
*NL*
have
described
Susannah
's
affliction
--
is
not
all
flesh
grass
?
--
Tis
*NL*
clay
,
--
't
is
dirt
.
--
They
all
looked
directly
at
the
scullion
,
--
the
*NL*
scullion
had
just
been
scouring
a
fish-kettle
.
--
It
was
not
fair
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
What
is
the
finest
face
that
ever
man
looked
at
!
--
I
could
hear
Trim
*NL*
talk
so
for
ever
,
cried
Susannah
,
--
what
is
it
!
-LRB-
Susannah
laid
her
hand
*NL*
upon
Trim
's
shoulder
-RRB-
--
but
corruption
?
--
Susannah
took
it
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
love
you
for
this
--
and
't
is
this
delicious
mixture
within
you
*NL*
which
makes
you
dear
creatures
what
you
are
--
and
he
who
hates
you
for
*NL*
it
--
all
I
can
say
of
the
matter
is
--
That
he
has
either
a
pumpkin
for
his
*NL*
head
--
or
a
pippin
for
his
heart
,
--
and
whenever
he
is
dissected
`
twill
be
*NL*
found
so
.

*NL*
Whether
Susannah
,
by
taking
her
hand
too
suddenly
from
off
the
*NL*
corporal
's
shoulder
-LRB-
by
the
whisking
about
of
her
passions
-RRB-
--
broke
a
*NL*
little
the
chain
of
his
reflexions
--
*NL*
*NL*
Or
whether
the
corporal
began
to
be
suspicious
,
he
had
got
into
the
*NL*
doctor
's
quarters
,
and
was
talking
more
like
the
chaplain
than
himself
--
*NL*
*NL*
Or
whether
...
Or
whether
--
for
in
all
such
cases
a
man
of
invention
and
*NL*
parts
may
with
pleasure
fill
a
couple
of
pages
with
suppositions
--
which
*NL*
of
all
these
was
the
cause
,
let
the
curious
physiologist
,
or
the
curious
*NL*
any
body
determine
--
't
is
certain
,
at
least
,
the
corporal
went
on
thus
*NL*
with
his
harangue
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
I
declare
it
,
that
out
of
doors
,
I
value
not
death
at
*NL*
all
:
--
not
this
...
added
the
corporal
,
snapping
his
fingers
,
--
but
with
an
*NL*
air
which
no
one
but
the
corporal
could
have
given
to
the
sentiment
.
--
In
*NL*
battle
,
I
value
death
not
this
...
and
let
him
not
take
me
cowardly
,
*NL*
like
poor
Joe
Gibbins
,
in
scouring
his
gun
.
--
What
is
he
?
A
pull
of
*NL*
a
trigger
--
a
push
of
a
bayonet
an
inch
this
way
or
that
--
makes
the
*NL*
difference
.
--
Look
along
the
line
--
to
the
right
--
see
!
Jack
's
down
!
*NL*
well
,
--
't
is
worth
a
regiment
of
horse
to
him
.
--
No
--
't
is
Dick
.
Then
*NL*
Jack
's
no
worse
.
--
Never
mind
which
,
--
we
pass
on
,
--
in
hot
pursuit
the
*NL*
wound
itself
which
brings
him
is
not
felt
,
--
the
best
way
is
to
stand
up
*NL*
to
him
,
--
the
man
who
flies
,
is
in
ten
times
more
danger
than
the
man
*NL*
who
marches
up
into
his
jaws
.
--
I
've
look
'd
him
,
added
the
corporal
,
an
*NL*
hundred
times
in
the
face
,
--
and
know
what
he
is
.
--
He
's
nothing
,
*NL*
Obadiah
,
at
all
in
the
field
.
--
But
he
's
very
frightful
in
a
house
,
quoth
*NL*
Obadiah
.
--
I
never
mind
it
myself
,
said
Jonathan
,
upon
a
coach-box
.
--
It
*NL*
must
,
in
my
opinion
,
be
most
natural
in
bed
,
replied
Susannah
.
--
And
*NL*
could
I
escape
him
by
creeping
into
the
worst
calf
's
skin
that
ever
*NL*
was
made
into
a
knapsack
,
I
would
do
it
there
--
said
Trim
--
but
that
is
*NL*
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nature
is
nature
,
said
Jonathan
.
--
And
that
is
the
reason
,
cried
*NL*
Susannah
,
I
so
much
pity
my
mistress
.
--
She
will
never
get
the
better
of
*NL*
it
.
--
Now
I
pity
the
captain
the
most
of
any
one
in
the
family
,
answered
*NL*
Trim
.
--
Madam
will
get
ease
of
heart
in
weeping
,
--
and
the
Squire
in
*NL*
talking
about
it
,
--
but
my
poor
master
will
keep
it
all
in
silence
to
*NL*
himself
.
--
I
shall
hear
him
sigh
in
his
bed
for
a
whole
month
together
,
*NL*
as
he
did
for
lieutenant
Le
Fever
.
An
'
please
your
honour
,
do
not
sigh
*NL*
so
piteously
,
I
would
say
to
him
as
I
laid
besides
him
.
I
can
not
help
*NL*
it
,
Trim
,
my
master
would
say
,
--
't
is
so
melancholy
an
accident
--
I
can
not
*NL*
get
it
off
my
heart
.
--
Your
honour
fears
not
death
yourself
.
--
I
hope
,
*NL*
Trim
,
I
fear
nothing
,
he
would
say
,
but
the
doing
a
wrong
thing
.
--
Well
,
*NL*
he
would
add
,
whatever
betides
,
I
will
take
care
of
Le
Fever
's
boy
.
--
And
*NL*
with
that
,
like
a
quieting
draught
,
his
honour
would
fall
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
like
to
hear
Trim
's
stories
about
the
captain
,
said
Susannah
.
--
He
is
*NL*
a
kindly-hearted
gentleman
,
said
Obadiah
,
as
ever
lived
.
--
Aye
,
and
*NL*
as
brave
a
one
too
,
said
the
corporal
,
as
ever
stept
before
a
*NL*
platoon
.
--
There
never
was
a
better
officer
in
the
king
's
army
,
--
or
*NL*
a
better
man
in
God
's
world
;
for
he
would
march
up
to
the
mouth
of
a
*NL*
cannon
,
though
he
saw
the
lighted
match
at
the
very
touch-hole
,
--
and
*NL*
yet
,
for
all
that
,
he
has
a
heart
as
soft
as
a
child
for
other
*NL*
people
.
--
He
would
not
hurt
a
chicken
.
--
I
would
sooner
,
quoth
Jonathan
,
*NL*
drive
such
a
gentleman
for
seven
pounds
a
year
--
than
some
for
*NL*
eight
.
--
Thank
thee
,
Jonathan
!
for
thy
twenty
shillings
,
--
as
much
,
*NL*
Jonathan
,
said
the
corporal
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
,
as
if
thou
hadst
*NL*
put
the
money
into
my
own
pocket
.
--
I
would
serve
him
to
the
day
of
my
*NL*
death
out
of
love
.
He
is
a
friend
and
a
brother
to
me
,
--
and
could
I
be
*NL*
sure
my
poor
brother
Tom
was
dead
,
--
continued
the
corporal
,
taking
out
*NL*
his
handkerchief
,
--
was
I
worth
ten
thousand
pounds
,
I
would
leave
every
*NL*
shilling
of
it
to
the
captain
.
--
Trim
could
not
refrain
from
tears
at
*NL*
this
testamentary
proof
he
gave
of
his
affection
to
his
master
.
--
The
*NL*
whole
kitchen
was
affected
.
--
Do
tell
us
the
story
of
the
poor
*NL*
lieutenant
,
said
Susannah
.

With
all
my
heart

the
corporal

*NL*
Susannah
,
the
cook

Jonathan

Obadiah

Trim

formed

*NL*
I
am
a
Turk
if
I
had
not
as
much
forgot
my
mother
,
as
if
Nature
had
*NL*
plaistered
me
up
,
and
set
me
down
naked
upon
the
banks
of
the
river
*NL*
Nile
,
without

--
Your
most
obedient
servant
,
Madam
--
I
've
cost
you
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
trouble
,
--
I
wish
it
may
answer
;
--
but
you
have
left
a
crack
*NL*
in
my
back
,
--
and
here
's
a
great
piece
fallen
off
here
before
,
--
and
what
*NL*
must
I
do
with
this
foot
?
--
I
shall
never
reach
England
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
I
never
wonder
at
any
thing
;
--
and
so
often
has
my
*NL*
judgment
deceived
me
in
my
life
,
that
I
always
suspect
it
,
right
or
*NL*
wrong
,
--
at
least
I
am
seldom
hot
upon
cold
subjects
.
For
all
this
,
I
*NL*
reverence
truth
as
much
as
any
body
;
and
when
it
has
slipped
us
,
if
a
*NL*
man
will
but
take
me
by
the
hand
,
and
go
quietly
and
search
for
it
,
*NL*
as
for
a
thing
we
have
both
lost
,
and
can
neither
of
us
do
*NL*
well
without
,
--
I
'll
go
to
the
world
's
end
with
him
:
--
But
I
hate
*NL*
disputes
,
--
and
therefore
-LRB-
bating
religious
points
,
or
such
as
touch
*NL*
society
-RRB-
I
would
almost
subscribe
to
any
thing
which
does
not
choak
me
*NL*
in
the
first
passage
,
rather
than
be
drawn
into
one
--
But
I
can
not
*NL*
bear
suffocation
,
--
and
bad
smells
worst
of
all
.
--
For
which
reasons
,
I
*NL*
resolved
from
the
beginning
,
That
if
ever
the
army
of
martyrs
was
to
be
*NL*
augmented
,
--
or
a
new
one
raised
,
--
I
would
have
no
hand
in
it
,
one
way
or
*NL*
t
`
other

But
to
return
to
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
's
opinion
,
Madam
,
`
that
there
could
be
no
harm
in
*NL*
Cornelius
Gallus
,
the
Roman
praetor
's
lying
with
his
wife
;
'
--
or
rather
*NL*
the
last
word
of
that
opinion
,
--
-LRB-
for
it
was
all
my
mother
heard
of
it
-RRB-
*NL*
caught
hold
of
her
by
the
weak
part
of
the
whole
sex
:
--
You
shall
not
*NL*
mistake
me
,
--
I
mean
her
curiosity
,
--
she
instantly
concluded
herself
the
*NL*
subject
of
the
conversation
,
and
with
that
prepossession
upon
her
fancy
,
*NL*
you
will
readily
conceive
every
word
my
father
said
,
was
accommodated
*NL*
either
to
herself
,
or
her
family
concerns
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pray
,
Madam
,
in
what
street
does
the
lady
live
,
who
would
not
have
*NL*
done
the
same
?
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
strange
mode
of
Cornelius
's
death
,
my
father
had
made
a
*NL*
transition
to
that
of
Socrates
,
and
was
giving
my
uncle
Toby
an
abstract
*NL*
of
his
pleading
before
his
judges
;
--
't
was
irresistible
:
--
not
the
oration
*NL*
of
Socrates
,
--
but
my
father
's
temptation
to
it
.
--
He
had
wrote
the
Life
*NL*
of
Socrates
-LRB-
This
book
my
father
would
never
consent
to
publish
;
't
is
in
*NL*
manuscript
,
with
some
other
tracts
of
his
,
in
the
family
,
all
,
or
most
*NL*
of
which
will
be
printed
in
due
time
.
-RRB-
himself
the
year
before
he
left
*NL*
off
trade
,
which
,
I
fear
,
was
the
means
of
hastening
him
out
of
it
;
--
so
*NL*
that
no
one
was
able
to
set
out
with
so
full
a
sail
,
and
in
so
swelling
*NL*
a
tide
of
heroic
loftiness
upon
the
occasion
,
as
my
father
was
.
Not
*NL*
a
period
in
Socrates
's
oration
,
which
closed
with
a
shorter
word
than
*NL*
transmigration
,
or
annihilation
,
--
or
a
worse
thought
in
the
middle
of
it
*NL*
than
to
be
--
or
not
to
be

--
the
entering
upon
a
new
and
untried
state
of
*NL*
things
,
--
or
,
upon
a
long
,
a
profound
and
peaceful
sleep
,
without
dreams
,
*NL*
without
disturbance
?
--
That
we
and
our
children
were
born
to
die
,
--
but
*NL*
neither
of
us
born
to
be
slaves
.
--
No

there
I
mistake
;
that
was
part
of
*NL*
Eleazer
's
oration
,
as
recorded
by
Josephus
-LRB-
de
Bell
.
Judaic
-RRB-
--
Eleazer
*NL*
owns
he
had
it
from
the
philosophers
of
India
;
in
all
likelihood
*NL*
Alexander
the
Great
,
in
his
irruption
into
India
,
after
he
had
over-run
*NL*
Persia
,
amongst
the
many
things
he
stole
,
--
stole
that
sentiment
also
;
*NL*
by
which
means
it
was
carried
,
if
not
all
the
way
by
himself
-LRB-
for
we
*NL*
all
know
he
died
at
Babylon
-RRB-
,
at
least
by
some
of
his
maroders
,
into
*NL*
Greece
,
--
from
Greece
it
got
to
Rome
,
--
from
Rome
to
France
,

from
*NL*
France
to
England
:

So
things
come
round

*NL*
By
land
carriage
,
I
can
conceive
no
other
way
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
By
water
the
sentiment
might
easily
have
come
down
the
Ganges
into
the
*NL*
Sinus
Gangeticus
,
or
Bay
of
Bengal
,
and
so
into
the
Indian
Sea
;
and
*NL*
following
the
course
of
trade
-LRB-
the
way
from
India
by
the
Cape
of
Good
*NL*
Hope
being
then
unknown
-RRB-
,
might
be
carried
with
other
drugs
and
spices
*NL*
up
the
Red
Sea
to
Joddah
,
the
port
of
Mekka
,
or
else
to
Tor
or
Sues
,
*NL*
towns
at
the
bottom
of
the
gulf
;
and
from
thence
by
karrawans
to
Coptos
,
*NL*
but
three
days
journey
distant
,
so
down
the
Nile
directly
to
Alexandria
,
*NL*
where
the
Sentiment
would
be
landed
at
the
very
foot
of
the
great
*NL*
stair-case
of
the
Alexandrian
library
,
--
and
from
that
store-house
it
*NL*
would
be

Now
my

had

a

like
that
of

case
there
*NL*
ever
was
such
a

lived

for

before

to
vote

therefore
,
that
*NL*
he
never
lived

is
a

cruel

is
not
doing

done

My
father
,
I
say
,
had
a
way
,
when
*NL*
things
went
extremely
wrong
with
him
,
especially
upon
the
first
sally
*NL*
of
his
impatience
,
--
of
wondering
why
he
was
begot
,
--
wishing
himself
*NL*
dead
;
--
sometimes
worse
:
--
And
when
the
provocation
ran
high
,
and
grief
*NL*
touched
his
lips
with
more
than
ordinary
powers
--
Sir
,
you
scarce
could
*NL*
have
distinguished
him
from
Socrates
himself
.
--
Every
word
would
breathe
*NL*
the
sentiments
of
a
soul
disdaining
life
,
and
careless
about
all
its
*NL*
issues
;
for
which
reason
,
though
my
mother
was
a
woman
of
no
deep
*NL*
reading
,
yet
the
abstract
of
Socrates
's
oration
,
which
my
father
was
*NL*
giving
my
uncle
Toby
,
was
not
altogether
new
to
her
.
--
She
listened
to
*NL*
it
with
composed
intelligence
,
and
would
have
done
so
to
the
end
of
the
*NL*
chapter
,
had
not
my
father
plunged
-LRB-
which
he
had
no
occasion
to
have
*NL*
done
-RRB-
into
that
part
of
the
pleading
where
the
great
philosopher
*NL*
reckons
up
his
connections
,
his
alliances
,
and
children
;
but
renounces
*NL*
a
security
to
be
so
won
by
working
upon
the
passions
of
his
judges
.

I
*NL*

he

he

*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
which
entered
my
father
's
head
,
after
affairs
were
*NL*
a
little
settled
in
the
family
,
and
Susanna
had
got
possession
of
my
*NL*
mother
's
green
sattin
night-gown
,
--
was
to
sit
down
coolly
,
after
the
*NL*
example
of
Xenophon
,
and
write
a
Tristra-paedia
,
or
system
of
education
*NL*
for
me
;
collecting
first
for
that
purpose
his
own
scattered
thoughts
,
*NL*
counsels
,
and
notions
;
and
binding
them
together
,
so
as
to
form
an
*NL*
Institute
for
the
government
of
my
childhood
and
adolescence
.
I
was
*NL*
my
father
's
last
stake
--
he
had
lost
my
brother
Bobby
entirely
,
--
he
had
*NL*
lost
,
by
his
own
computation
,
full
three-fourths
of
me
--
that
is
,
he
had
*NL*
been
unfortunate
in
his
three
first
great
casts
for
me
--
my
geniture
,
*NL*
nose
,
and
name
,
--
there
was
but
this
one
left
;
and
accordingly
my
father
*NL*
gave
himself
up
to
it
with
as
much
devotion
as
ever
my
uncle
Toby
had
*NL*
done
to
his
doctrine
of
projectils
.
--
The
difference
between
them
was
,
*NL*
that
my
uncle
Toby
drew
his
whole
knowledge
of
projectils
from
Nicholas
*NL*
Tartaglia
--
My
father
spun
his
,
every
thread
of
it
,
out
of
his
own
*NL*
brain
,
--
or
reeled
and
cross-twisted
what
all
other
spinners
and
*NL*
spinsters
had
spun
before
him
,
that
't
was
pretty
near
the
same
torture
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
three
years
,
or
something
more
,
my
father
had
got
advanced
*NL*
almost
into
the
middle
of
his
work
.
--
Like
all
other
writers
,
he
met
with
*NL*
disappointments
.
--
He
imagined
he
should
be
able
to
bring
whatever
he
had
*NL*
to
say
,
into
so
small
a
compass
,
that
when
it
was
finished
and
bound
,
*NL*
it
might
be
rolled
up
in
my
mother
's
hussive
.
--
Matter
grows
under
our
*NL*
hands
.
--
Let
no
man
say
,
--
`
Come
--
I
'll
write
a
duodecimo
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
gave
himself
up
to
it
,
however
,
with
the
most
painful
*NL*
diligence
,
proceeding
step
by
step
in
every
line
,
with
the
same
kind
of
*NL*
caution
and
circumspection
-LRB-
though
I
can
not
say
upon
quite
so
religious
*NL*
a
principle
-RRB-
as
was
used
by
John
de
la
Casse
,
the
lord
archbishop
of
*NL*
Benevento
,
in
compassing
his
Galatea
;
in
which
his
Grace
of
Benevento
*NL*
spent
near
forty
years
of
his
life
;
and
when
the
thing
came
out
,
it
was
*NL*
not
of
above
half
the
size
or
the
thickness
of
a
Rider
's
Almanack
.
--
How
*NL*
the
holy
man
managed
the
affair
,
unless
he
spent
the
greatest
part
*NL*
of
his
time
in
combing
his
whiskers
,
or
playing
at
primero
with
his
*NL*
chaplain
,
--
would
pose
any
mortal
not
let
into
the
true
secret
;
--
and
*NL*
therefore
't
is
worth
explaining
to
the
world
,
was
it
only
for
the
*NL*
encouragement
of
those
few
in
it
,
who
write
not
so
much
to
be
fed
--
as
to
*NL*
be
famous
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
own
had
John
de
la
Casse
,
the
archbishop
of
Benevento
,
for
*NL*
whose
memory
-LRB-
notwithstanding
his
Galatea
,
-RRB-
I
retain
the
highest
*NL*
veneration
,
--
had
he
been
,
Sir
,
a
slender
clerk
--
of
dull
wit
--
slow
*NL*
parts
--
costive
head
,
and
so
forth
,
--
he
and
his
Galatea
might
have
jogged
*NL*
on
together
to
the
age
of
Methuselah
for
me
,
--
the
phaenomenon
had
not
*NL*
been
worth
a
parenthesis
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
reverse
of
this
was
the
truth
:
John
de
la
Casse
was
a
genius
of
*NL*
fine
parts
and
fertile
fancy
;
and
yet
with
all
these
great
advantages
of
*NL*
nature
,
which
should
have
pricked
him
forwards
with
his
Galatea
,
he
lay
*NL*
under
an
impuissance
at
the
same
time
of
advancing
above
a
line
and
*NL*
a
half
in
the
compass
of
a
whole
summer
's
day
:
this
disability
in
his
*NL*
Grace
arose
from
an
opinion
he
was
afflicted
with
,
--
which
opinion
was
*NL*
this
,
--
viz
.
that
whenever
a
Christian
was
writing
a
book
-LRB-
not
for
his
*NL*
private
amusement
,
but
-RRB-
where
his
intent
and
purpose
was
,
bona
fide
,
to
*NL*
print
and
publish
it
to
the
world
,
his
first
thoughts
were
always
the
*NL*
temptations
of
the
evil
one
.
--
This
was
the
state
of
ordinary
writers
:
*NL*
but
when
a
personage
of
venerable
character
and
high
station
,
either
in
*NL*
church
or
state
,
once
turned
author
,
--
he
maintained
,
that
from
the
very
*NL*
moment
he
took
pen
in
hand
--
all
the
devils
in
hell
broke
out
of
their
*NL*
holes
to
cajole
him
.
--
'T
was
Term-time
with
them
,
--
every
thought
,
first
*NL*
and
last
,
was
captious
;
--
how
specious
and
good
soever
,
--
't
was
*NL*
all
one
;
--
in
whatever
form
or
colour
it
presented
itself
to
the
*NL*
imagination
,
--
't
was
still
a
stroke
of
one
or
other
of
'em
levell
'd
at
*NL*
him
,
and
was
to
be
fenced
off
.
--
So
that
the
life
of
a
writer
,
whatever
*NL*
he
might
fancy
to
the
contrary
,
was
not
so
much
a
state
of
composition
,
*NL*
as
a
state
of
warfare
;
and
his
probation
in
it
,
precisely
that
of
any
*NL*
other
man

depending
alike

his
Resistance

*NL*
My
father
was
hugely
pleased
with
this
theory
of
John
de
la
Casse
,
*NL*
archbishop
of
Benevento
;
and
-LRB-
had
it
not
cramped
him
a
little
in
his
*NL*
creed
-RRB-
I
believe
would
have
given
ten
of
the
best
acres
in
the
Shandy
*NL*
estate
,
to
have
been
the
broacher
of
it
.
--
How
far
my
father
actually
*NL*
believed
in
the
devil
,
will
be
seen
,
when
I
come
to
speak
of
my
father
's
*NL*
religious
notions
,
in
the
progress
of
this
work
:
't
is
enough
to
say
*NL*
here
,
as
he
could
not
have
the
honour
of
it
,
in
the
literal
sense
of
*NL*
the
doctrine
--
he
took
up
with
the
allegory
of
it
;
and
would
often
say
,
*NL*
especially
when
his
pen
was
a
little
retrograde
,
there
was
as
much
good
*NL*
meaning
,
truth
,
and
knowledge
,
couched
under
the
veil
of
John
de
la
*NL*
Casse
's
parabolical
representation
,
--
as
was
to
be
found
in
any
one
*NL*
poetic
fiction
or
mystic
record
of
antiquity
.
--
Prejudice
of
education
,
*NL*
he
would
say
,
is
the
devil
,
--
and
the
multitudes
of
them
which
we
suck
*NL*
in
with
our
mother
's
milk
--
are
the
devil
and
all
.
--
We
are
haunted
with
*NL*
them
,
brother
Toby
,
in
all
our
lucubrations
and
researches
;
and
was
a
*NL*
man
fool
enough
to
submit
tamely
to
what
they
obtruded
upon
him
,
--
what
*NL*
would
his
book
be
?
Nothing
,
--
he
would
add
,
throwing
his
pen
away
with
*NL*
a
vengeance
,
--
nothing
but
a
farrago
of
the
clack
of
nurses
,
and
of
the
*NL*
nonsense
of
the
old
women
-LRB-
of
both
sexes
-RRB-
throughout
the
kingdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
best
account
I
am
determined
to
give
of
the
slow
progress
*NL*
my
father
made
in
his
Tristra-paedia
;
at
which
-LRB-
as
I
said
-RRB-
he
was
three
*NL*
years
,
and
something
more
,
indefatigably
at
work
,
and
,
at
last
,
had
*NL*
scarce
completed
,
by
this
own
reckoning
,
one
half
of
his
undertaking
:
*NL*
the
misfortune
was
,
that
I
was
all
that
time
totally
neglected
and
*NL*
abandoned
to
my
mother
;
and
what
was
almost
as
bad
,
by
the
very
delay
,
*NL*
the
first
part
of
the
work
,
upon
which
my
father
had
spent
the
most
*NL*
of
his
pains
,
was
rendered
entirely
useless
,
--
every
day
a
page
or
two
*NL*
became
of
no
consequence
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Certainly
it
was
ordained
as
a
scourge
upon
the
pride
of
human
wisdom
,
*NL*
That
the
wisest
of
us
all
should
thus
outwit
ourselves
,
and
eternally
*NL*
forego
our
purposes
in
the
intemperate
act
of
pursuing
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
my
father
was
so
long
in
all
his
acts
of
resistance
,
--
or
in
*NL*
other
words
,
--
he
advanced
so
very
slow
with
his
work
,
and
I
began
*NL*
to
live
and
get
forwards
at
such
a
rate
,
that
if
an
event
had
not
*NL*
happened
,
--
which
,
when
we
get
to
it
,
if
it
can
be
told
with
decency
,
*NL*
shall
not
be
concealed
a
moment
from
the
reader
--
I
verily
believe
,
I
had
*NL*
put
by
my
father
,
and
left
him
drawing
a
sundial
,
for
no
better
purpose
*NL*
than
to
be
buried
under
ground
.

under

Can

you
contrive

quoth
Susannah
,
lifting
up
the
sash
with
one
*NL*
hand
,
as
she
spoke
,
and
helping
me
up
into
the
window-seat
with

my

,
for

was

Susannah
did
not
consider
that
nothing

hung
in

,

so
slap
came
the
sash
down
like
lightning
upon
*NL*
us
;

Nothing

left
,

cried
Susannah
,
--
nothing
is
left

for
me
,
but
to
*NL*
run
my
country
.

My
uncle
Toby

house
was
a
much
kinder
sanctuary

When

told

the

of
the
sash
,
with
*NL*
all
the
circumstances
which
attended
the
murder
of
me
,

she
called
*NL*
it
,
-RRB-
--
the
blood
forsook
his
cheeks
,
--
all
accessaries
in
murder
being
*NL*
principals
,
--
Trim
's
conscience
told
him
he
was
as
much
to
blame
as
*NL*
Susannah
,
--
and
if
the
doctrine
had
been
true
,
my
uncle
Toby
had
as
much
*NL*
of
the
bloodshed
to
answer
for
to
heaven
,
as
either
of
'em
;
--
so
that
*NL*
neither
reason
or
instinct

separate

together

could
possibly
have
*NL*
guided
Susannah
's
steps
to
so
proper
an
asylum

It

in

to
leave

this

imagination

to
form
any

will
render
these

feasible

he
must
cudgel
his
brains

sore

to
do
it
without
,

he
must
have
such
brains
as
no
reader
ever
*NL*
had
before
him
.

Why
should
I
put
them
either
to
trial

to
torture
?

is

own
affair

'T

,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
resting
with
his
hand
upon
the
*NL*
corporal
's
shoulder
,
as
they
both
stood
surveying
their
works
,
--
that
*NL*
we
have
not
a
couple
of
field-pieces
to
mount
in
the
gorge
of
that
new
*NL*
redoubt
;
--
`
twould
secure
the
lines
all
along
there
,
and
make
the
attack
*NL*
on
that
side
quite
complete
:
--
get
me
a
couple
cast
,
Trim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
honour
shall
have
them
,
replied
Trim
,
before
tomorrow
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
joy
of
Trim
's
heart
,
nor
was
his
fertile
head
ever
at
a
loss
*NL*
for
expedients
in
doing
it
,
to
supply
my
uncle
Toby
in
his
campaigns
,
*NL*
with
whatever
his
fancy
called
for
;
had
it
been
his
last
crown
,
he
would
*NL*
have
sate
down
and
hammered
it
into
a
paderero
,
to
have
prevented
a
*NL*
single
wish
in
his
master
.
The
corporal
had
already
,
--
what
with
cutting
*NL*
off
the
ends
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
spouts
--
hacking
and
chiseling
up
*NL*
the
sides
of
his
leaden
gutters
,
--
melting
down
his
pewter
*NL*
shaving-bason
,
--
and
going
at
last
,
like
Lewis
the
Fourteenth
,
on
to
*NL*
the
top
of
the
church
,
for
spare
ends
,
&
c.
--
he
had
that
very
campaign
*NL*
brought
no
less
than
eight
new
battering
cannons
,
besides
three
*NL*
demi-culverins
,
into
the
field
;
my
uncle
Toby
's
demand
for
two
more
*NL*
pieces
for
the
redoubt
,
had
set
the
corporal
at
work
again
;
and
no
*NL*
better
resource
offering
,
he
had
taken
the
two
leaden
weights
from
the
*NL*
nursery
window
:
and
as
the
sash
pullies
,
when
the
lead
was
gone
,
were
of
*NL*
no
kind
of
use
,
he
had
taken
them
away
also
,
to
make
a
couple
of
wheels
*NL*
for
one
of
their
carriages
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
dismantled
every
sash-window
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
long
*NL*
before
,
in
the
very
same
way
,
--
though
not
always
in
the
same
order
;
for
*NL*
sometimes
the
pullies
have
been
wanted
,
and
not
the
lead
,
--
so
then
he
*NL*
began
with
the
pullies
,
--
and
the
pullies
being
picked
out
,
then
the
lead
*NL*
became
useless
,
--
and
so
the
lead
went
to
pot
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
great
Moral
might
be
picked
handsomely
out
of
this
,
but
I
have
not
*NL*
time
--
't
is
enough
to
say
,
wherever
the
demolition
began
,
't
was
equally
*NL*
fatal
to
the
sash
window
.

The
corporal
had
not
taken
his
measures
so
badly
in
this
stroke
of
*NL*
artilleryship
,
but
that
he
might
have
kept
the
matter
entirely
to
*NL*
himself
,
and
left
Susannah
to
have
sustained
the
whole
weight
of
the
*NL*
attack
,
as
she
could
;
--
true
courage
is
not
content
with
coming
*NL*
off
so
.
--
The
corporal
,
whether
as
general
or
comptroller
of
the
*NL*
train
,
--
't
was
no
matter
,
--
had
done
that
,
without
which
,
as
he
imagined
,
*NL*
the
misfortune
could
never
have
happened
,
--
at
least
in
Susannah
's
*NL*
hands
;
--
How
would
your
honours
have
behaved
?
--
He
determined
at
once
,
*NL*
not
to
take
shelter
behind
Susannah
,
--
but
to
give
it
;
and
with
this
*NL*
resolution
upon
his
mind
,
he
marched
upright
into
the
parlour
,
to
lay
*NL*
the
whole
manoeuvre
before
my
uncle
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
had
just
then
been
giving
Yorick
an
account
of
the
Battle
*NL*
of
Steenkirk
,
and
of
the
strange
conduct
of
count
Solmes
in
ordering
the
*NL*
foot
to
halt
,
and
the
horse
to
march
where
it
could
not
act
;
which
was
*NL*
directly
contrary
to
the
king
's
commands
,
and
proved
the
loss
of
the
*NL*
day
.

There
are
incidents
in

follow

striking

made
a
shift
to

tell
his

Corporal

replied
my

Toby

putting
on
his
hat
which
lay
upon
*NL*
the
table
,
--
if
any
thing
can
be
said
to
be
a
fault
,
when
the
service
*NL*
absolutely
requires
it
should
be
done
,

't
is
I
certainly
who
deserve
the
*NL*
blame
,

you
obeyed
your
orders

Solmes

Trim
,
done
the

at

battle
of

said
*NL*
Yorick
,
drolling
a
little
upon
the
corporal
,
who
had
been
run
over
by
*NL*
a
dragoon
in
the
retreat
,
--
he
had
saved
thee
;
--
Saved
!
cried
Trim
,
*NL*
interrupting
Yorick
,
and
finishing
the
sentence
for
him
after
his
own
*NL*
fashion
,
--
he
had
saved
five
battalions
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
every
*NL*
soul
of
them
:
--
there
was
Cutt
's
,
--
continued
the
corporal
,
clapping
the
*NL*
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
upon
the
thumb
of
his
left
,
and
counting
*NL*
round
his
hand
,
--
there
was
Cutt
's
,
--
Mackay
's
,
--
Angus
's
,
--
Graham
's
,
--
and
*NL*
Leven
's
,
all
cut
to
pieces
;
--
and
so
had
the
English
life-guards
too
,
had
*NL*
it
not
been
for
some
regiments
upon
the
right
,
who
marched
up
boldly
to
*NL*
their
relief
,
and
received
the
enemy
's
fire
in
their
faces
,
before
any
*NL*
one
of
their
own
platoons
discharged
a
musket
,
--
they
'll
go
to
heaven
*NL*
for
it
,
--
added
Trim
.
--
Trim
is
right
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
nodding
to
*NL*
Yorick
,
--
he
's
perfectly
right
.
What
signified
his
marching
the
horse
,
*NL*
continued
the
corporal
,
where
the
ground
was
so
strait
,
that
the
French
*NL*
had
such
a
nation
of
hedges
,
and
copses
,
and
ditches
,
and
fell
'd
trees
*NL*
laid
this
way

that
to
cover
them
-LRB-
as
they
always
have

Count

Solmes
should
have
sent
us

fired

them

There
was
nothing
to
be
done
for
the
horse
:

he
*NL*
had
his
foot
shot
off
however
for
his
pains

continued
the
corporal
,
the
*NL*
very
next
campaign
at
Landen

--
Poor
Trim
got
his
wound
there

quoth
*NL*
my

'T

not

Trim

said
my

the

There

my

a

*NL*
King
William
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
addressing
himself
to
Yorick
,
was
so
*NL*
terribly
provoked
at
count
Solmes
for
disobeying
his
orders
,
that
he
*NL*
would
not
suffer
him
to
come
into
his
presence
for
many
months
after
.
--
I
*NL*
fear
,
answered
Yorick
,
the
squire
will
be
as
much
provoked
at
the
*NL*
corporal
,
as
the
King
at
the
count
.
--
But
`
twould
be
singularly
hard
*NL*
in
this
case
,
continued
be
,
if
corporal
Trim
,
who
has
behaved
so
*NL*
diametrically
opposite
to
count
Solmes
,
should
have
the
fate
to
be
*NL*
rewarded
with
the
same
disgrace
:
--
too
oft
in
this
world
,
do
things
take
*NL*
that
train
.
--
I
would
spring
a
mine
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
rising
up
,
--
and
*NL*
blow
up
my
fortifications
,
and
my
house
with
them
,
and
we
would
perish
*NL*
under
their
ruins
,
ere
I
would
stand
by
and
see
it
.
--
Trim
directed
a
*NL*
slight
,
--
but
a
grateful
bow
towards
his
master
,
--
and
so
the
chapter
*NL*

Then

Yorick

my

you

I
will
lead
the
way

abreast
,

do
you

follow

us

Susannah

please

said
Trim
,

be
put
in

'T

an
excellent
disposition
,

and
in

order
,
without

either
drums
beating

I
had
cut
off
the

thought
to

As
many
pictures
as
have
been
given
of
my
father
,
how
like
him
soever
*NL*
in
different
airs
and
attitudes
,
--
not
one
,
or
all
of
them
,
can
ever
help
*NL*
the
reader
to
any
kind
of
preconception
of
how
my
father
would
think
,
*NL*
speak
,
or
act
,
upon
any
untried
occasion
or
occurrence
of
life
.
--
There
*NL*
was
that
infinitude
of
oddities
in
him
,
and
of
chances
along
with
it
,
*NL*
by
which
handle
he
would
take
a
thing
,
--
it
baffled
,
Sir
,
all
*NL*
calculations
.
--
The
truth
was
,
his
road
lay
so
very
far
on
one
side
,
from
*NL*
that
wherein
most
men
travelled
,
--
that
every
object
before
him
presented
*NL*
a
face
and
section
of
itself
to
his
eye
,
altogether
different
from
the
*NL*
plan
and
elevation
of
it
seen
by
the
rest
of
mankind
.
--
In
other
words
,
*NL*
't
was
a
different
object
,
and
in
course
was
differently
considered
:
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
true
reason
,
that
my
dear
Jenny
and
I
,
as
well
as
all
the
*NL*
world
besides
us
,
have
such
eternal
squabbles
about
nothing
.

She
looks
*NL*

agree

about
her
value
?

,
with

could
not
have
made
so
diabolical
a
scream
of
it
,
as
I
*NL*
did
--
when
the
accident
befel
me
:
it
summoned
up
my
mother
instantly
into
*NL*
the
nursery
,
--
so
that
Susannah
had
but
just
time
to
make
her
escape
down
*NL*
the
back
stairs
,
as
my
mother
came
up
the
fore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
though
I
was
old
enough
to
have
told
the
story
myself
,
--
and
young
*NL*
enough
,
I
hope
,
to
have
done
it
without
malignity
;
yet
Susannah
,
in
*NL*
passing
by
the
kitchen
,
for
fear
of
accidents
,
had
left
it
in
short-hand
*NL*
with
the
cook
--
the
cook
had
told
it
with
a
commentary
to
Jonathan
,
and
*NL*
Jonathan
to
Obadiah
;
so
that
by
the
time
my
father
had
rung
the
bell
*NL*
half
a
dozen
times
,
to
know
what
was
the
matter
above
,
--
was
Obadiah
*NL*
enabled
to
give
him
a
particular
account
of
it
,
just
as
it
had
*NL*
happened
.
--
I
thought
as
much
,
said
my
father
,
tucking
up
his
*NL*
night-gown
;
--
and
so
walked
up
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
imagine
from
this
--
-LRB-
though
for
my
own
part
I
somewhat
*NL*
question
it
-RRB-
--
that
my
father
,
before
that
time
,
had
actually
wrote
that
*NL*
remarkable
character
in
the
Tristra-paedia
,
which
to
me
is
the
most
*NL*
original
and
entertaining
one
in
the
whole
book
;
--
and
that
is
the
*NL*
chapter
upon
sash-windows
,
with
a
bitter
Philippick
at
the
end
of
it
,
*NL*
upon
the
forgetfulness
of
chamber-maids
.
--
I
have
but
two
reasons
for
*NL*
thinking
otherwise
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
,
Had
the
matter
been
taken
into
consideration
,
before
the
event
*NL*
happened
,
my
father
certainly
would
have
nailed
up
the
sash
window
*NL*
for
good
an
'
all
;
--
which
,
considering
with
what
difficulty
he
composed
*NL*
books
,
--
he
might
have
done
with
ten
times
less
trouble
,
than
he
could
*NL*
have
wrote
the
chapter
:
this
argument
I
foresee
holds
good
against
his
*NL*
writing
a
chapter
,
even
after
the
event
;
but
't
is
obviated
under
the
*NL*
second
reason
,
which
I
have
the
honour
to
offer
to
the
world
in
*NL*
support
of
my
opinion
,
that
my
father
did
not
write
the
chapter
upon
*NL*
sash-windows
and
chamber-pots
,
at
the
time
supposed
,
--
and
it
is
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
,
in
order
to
render
the
Tristra-paedia
complete
,
--
I
wrote
the
*NL*
chapter
myself
.

My
father
put
on
his
spectacles

looked
,
--
took
them
off
,
--
put
them
into
*NL*
the
case
--
all
in
less
than
a
statutable
minute
;
and
without
opening
*NL*
his
lips
,
turned
about
and
walked
precipitately
down
stairs
:
my
mother
*NL*
imagined
he
had
stepped
down
for
lint
and
basilicon
;
but
seeing
him
*NL*
return
with
a
couple
of
folios
under
his
arm
,
and
Obadiah
following
him
*NL*
with
a
large
reading-desk
,
she
took
it
for
granted
't
was
an
herbal
,
and
*NL*
so
drew
him
a
chair
to
the
bedside
,
that
he
might
consult
upon
the
case
*NL*
at
his
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
it
be
but
right
done
,
--
said
my
father
,
turning
to
the
Section
--
de
*NL*

vel
subjecto
circumcisionis
,
--
for
he
had
brought
up
Spenser

Legibus

--
and
Maimonides
,
in
order
to
confront
and
*NL*
examine
us
altogether
.

*NL*
*NL*
--
If
it
be

right
done
,
quoth
he
:
--
only
tell
us
,
cried
my
mother
,
*NL*
interrupting
him
,
what
herbs
?
--
For
that
,
replied
my
father
,
you
must
*NL*
send
for
Dr.
Slop
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
went
down
,
and
my
father
went
on
,
reading
the
section
as
*NL*
follows
,
*NL*
*NL*
...
--
Very
well
,
--
said
my
father
,
...
--
nay
,
if
it
has
that
*NL*
convenience
--
and
so
without
stopping
a
moment
to
settle
it
first
in
his
*NL*
mind
,
whether
the
Jews
had
it
from
the
Egyptians
,
or
the
Egyptians
*NL*
from
the
Jews
,
--
he
rose
up
,
and
rubbing
his
forehead
two
or
three
times
*NL*
across
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
,
in
the
manner
we
rub
out
the
footsteps
*NL*
of
care
,
when
evil
has
trod
lighter
upon
us
than
we
foreboded
,
--
he
shut
*NL*
the
book
,
and
walked
down
stairs
.
--
Nay
,
said
he
,
mentioning
the
name
of
*NL*
a
different
great
nation
upon
every
step
as
he
set
his
foot
upon
it

stept
first

into

-RRB-
--
this
Tristram
of

I
find

comes
very
hardly

Never

initiated
into

my

*NL*
know
better
than
us
both

the

have
jumped

the

not

taking

turning
to

are
greatly
divided

still
who
Ilus
was

some

Saturn

some
the

no

Let

said
my

Toby
,
I
know
not

article
of
war
he
could
*NL*
justify
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
controvertists
,
answered
my
father
,
assign
two-and-twenty
different
*NL*
reasons
for
it
:
--
others
,
indeed
,
who
have
drawn
their
pens
on
the
*NL*
opposite
side
of
the
question

have
shewn
the

the
futility

the
*NL*
greatest
part
of

But
then
again
,
our
best
polemic
divines
--
I
wish
*NL*
there
was
not
a
polemic
divine
,
said
Yorick
,
in
the
kingdom
;
--
one
*NL*
ounce
of
practical
divinity
--
is
worth
a
painted
ship-load
of
all
their

reverences
have
imported
these
fifty

Pray

Mr.

do
tell

;
which
I
have
in
my
pocket
.
--
I
beg
I
may
hear
it
,
quoth
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
earnestly
.
--
You
shall
,
said
Yorick
.
--
And
as
the
corporal
*NL*
is
waiting
for
me
at
the
door
,
--
and
I
know
the
description
of
a
battle
*NL*
will
do
the
poor
fellow
more
good
than
his
supper
,
--
I
beg
,
brother
,
*NL*
you
'll
give
him
leave
to
come
in
.
--
With
all
my
soul
,
said
my
*NL*
father
.
--
Trim
came
in
,
erect
and
happy
as
an
emperor
;
and
having
shut
*NL*
the
door
,
Yorick
took
a
book
from
his
right-hand
coat-pocket
,
and
read
,
*NL*
or
pretended
to
read
,
as
follows
.

*NL*
*NL*
--
`
which
words
being
heard
by
all
the
soldiers
which
were
there
,
divers
*NL*
of
them
being
inwardly
terrified
,
did
shrink
back
and
make
room
for
*NL*
the
assailant
:
all
this
did
Gymnast
very
well
remark
and
consider
;
and
*NL*
therefore
,
making
as
if
he
would
have
alighted
from
off
his
horse
,
as
he
*NL*
was
poising
himself
on
the
mounting
side
,
he
most
nimbly
-LRB-
with
his
short
*NL*
sword
by
this
thigh
-RRB-
shifting
his
feet
in
the
stirrup
,
and
performing
*NL*
the
stirrup-leather
feat
,
whereby
,
after
the
inclining
of
his
body
*NL*
downwards
,
he
forthwith
launched
himself
aloft
into
the
air
,
and
placed
*NL*
both
his
feet
together
upon
the
saddle
,
standing
upright
,
with
his
back
*NL*
turned
towards
his
horse
's
head
,
--
Now
,
-LRB-
said
he
-RRB-
my
case
goes
forward
.
*NL*
Then
suddenly
in
the
same
posture
wherein
he
was
,
he
fetched
a
gambol
*NL*
upon
one
foot
,
and
turning
to
the
left-hand
,
failed
not
to
carry
his
*NL*
body
perfectly
round
,
just
into
his
former
position
,
without
missing
one
*NL*
jot
.
--
Ha
!
said
Tripet
,
I
will
not
do
that
at
this
time
,
--
and
not
without
*NL*
cause
.
Well
,
said
Gymnast
,
I
have
failed
,
--
I
will
undo
this
leap
;
then
*NL*
with
a
marvellous
strength
and
agility
,
turning
towards
the
right-hand
,
*NL*
he
fetched
another
striking
gambol
as
before
;
which
done
,
he
set
his
*NL*
right
hand
thumb
upon
the
bow
of
the
saddle
,
raised
himself
up
,
and
*NL*
sprung
into
the
air
,
poising
and
upholding
his
whole
weight
upon
the
*NL*
muscle
and
nerve
of
the
said
thumb
,
and
so
turned
and
whirled
himself
*NL*
about
three
times
:
at
the
fourth
,
reversing
his
body
,
and
overturning
it
*NL*
upside
down
,
and
foreside
back
,
without
touching
any
thing
,
he
brought
*NL*
himself
betwixt
the
horse
's
two
ears
,
and
then
giving
himself
a
jerking
*NL*
swing
,
he
seated
himself
upon
the
crupper
--
'
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
This
ca
n't
be
fighting
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
The
corporal
shook
his
*NL*
head
at
it
.
--
Have
patience
,
said
Yorick
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
-LRB-
Tripet
-RRB-
pass
'd
his
right
leg
over
his
saddle
,
and
placed
himself
*NL*
en
croup
.
--
But
,
said
he
,
`
twere
better
for
me
to
get
into
the
saddle
;
*NL*
then
putting
the
thumbs
of
both
hands
upon
the
crupper
before
him
,
and
*NL*
there-upon
leaning
himself
,
as
upon
the
only
supporters
of
his
body
,
*NL*
he
incontinently
turned
heels
over
head
in
the
air
,
and
strait
found
*NL*
himself
betwixt
the
bow
of
the
saddle
in
a
tolerable
seat
;
then
*NL*
springing
into
the
air
with
a
summerset
,
he
turned
him
about
like
*NL*
a
wind-mill
,
and
made
above
a
hundred
frisks
,
turns
,
and
*NL*
demi-pommadas
.
'
--
Good
God
!
cried
Trim
,
losing
all
patience
,
--
one
home
*NL*
thrust
of
a
bayonet
is
worth
it
all
.
--
I
think
so
too
,
replied
Yorick
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
of
a
contrary
opinion

my
father

*NL*
*NL*
--
No
,
--
I
think
I
have
advanced
nothing
,
replied
my
father
,
making
answer
*NL*
to
a
question
which
Yorick
had
taken
the
liberty
to
put
to
him
,
--
I
have
*NL*
advanced
nothing
in
the
Tristra-paedia
,
but
what
is
as
clear
as
any
*NL*
one
proposition
in
Euclid
.
--
Reach
me
,
Trim
,
that
book
from
off
the
*NL*
scrutoir
:
--
it
has
oft-times
been
in
my
mind
,
continued
my
father
,
to
*NL*
have
read
it
over
both
to
you
,
Yorick
,
and
to
my
brother
Toby
,
and
*NL*
I
think
it
a
little
unfriendly
in
myself
,
in
not
having
done
it
long
*NL*
ago
:
--
shall
we
have
a
short
chapter
or
two
now
,
--
and
a
chapter
or
two
*NL*
hereafter
,
as
occasions
serve
;
and
so
on
,
till
we
get
through
the
whole
?
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
and
Yorick
made
the
obeisance
which
was
proper
;
and
the
*NL*
corporal
,
though
he
was
not
included
in
the
compliment
,
laid
his
hand
*NL*
upon
his
breast
,
and
made
his
bow
at
the
same
time
.
--
The
company
smiled
.
*NL*
Trim
,
quoth
my
father
,
has
paid
the
full
price
for
staying
out
*NL*
the
entertainment
.
--
He
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
play
,
replied
*NL*
Yorick
.
--
'T
was
a
Tom-fool-battle
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
of
captain
*NL*
Tripet
's
and
that
other
officer
,
making
so
many
summersets
,
as
they
*NL*
advanced
;
--
the
French
come
on
capering
now
and
then
in
that
way
,
--
but
*NL*
not
quite
so
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
never
felt
the
consciousness
of
his
existence
with
more
*NL*
complacency
than
what
the
corporal
's
,
and
his
own
reflections
,
made
him
*NL*
do
at
that
moment
;
--
he
lighted
his
pipe
,
--
Yorick
drew
his
chair
closer
*NL*
to
the
table
,
--
Trim
snuff
'd
the
candle
,
--
my
father
stirr
'd
up

*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thirty
pages
,
said
my
father
,
turning
over
the
leaves
,
--
are
a
*NL*
little
dry
;
and
as
they
are
not
closely
connected
with
the
subject
,
--
for
*NL*
the
present
we
'll
pass
them
by
:
't
is
a
prefatory
introduction
,
continued
*NL*
my
father
,
or
an
introductory
preface
-LRB-
for
I
am
not
determined
which
*NL*
name
to
give
it
-RRB-
upon
political
or
civil
government
;
the
foundation
of
*NL*
which
being
laid
in
the
first
conjunction
betwixt
male
and
female
,
*NL*
for
procreation
of
the
species
--
I
was
insensibly
led
into
it
.
--
'T
was
*NL*
natural
,
said
Yorick
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
original
of
society
,
continued
my
father
,
I
'm
satisfied
is
,
what
*NL*
Politian
tells
us
,
i.
e.
merely
conjugal
;
and
nothing
more
than
the
*NL*
getting
together
of
one
man
and
one
woman
;
--
to
which
,
-LRB-
according
to
*NL*
Hesiod
-RRB-
the
philosopher
adds
a
servant
:
--
but
supposing
in
the
first
*NL*
beginning
there
were
no
men
servants
born
--
he
lays
the
foundation
of
*NL*
it
,
in
a
man
,
--
a
woman
--
and
a
bull
.
--
I
believe
't
is
an
ox
,
quoth
Yorick
,
*NL*
quoting
the
passage
-LRB-
Greek
-RRB-
--
A
bull
must
have
given
more
trouble
than
*NL*
his
head
was
worth
.
--
But
there
is
a
better
reason
still
,
said
my
father
*NL*
-LRB-
dipping
his
pen
into
his
ink
-RRB-
;
for
the
ox
being
the
most
patient
of
*NL*
animals
,
and
the
most
useful
withal
in
tilling
the
ground
for
their
*NL*
nourishment
,
--
was
the
properest
instrument
,
and
emblem
too
,
for
the
new
*NL*
joined
couple
,
that
the
creation
could
have
associated
with
them
.
--
And
*NL*
there
is
a
stronger
reason
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
than
them
all
for
the
*NL*
ox
.
--
My
father
had
not
power
to
take
his
pen
out
of
his
ink-horn
,
till
*NL*
he
had
heard
my
uncle
Toby
's
reason
.
--
For
when
the
ground
was
tilled
,
*NL*
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
made
worth
inclosing
,
then
they
began
to
secure
*NL*
it
by
walls
and
ditches
,
which
was
the
origin
of
fortification
.
--
True
,
*NL*
true
,
dear
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
striking
out
the
bull
,
and
putting
the
*NL*
ox
in
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
gave
Trim
a
nod
,
to
snuff
the
candle
,
and
resumed
his
*NL*
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
enter
upon
this
speculation
,
said
my
father
carelessly
,
and
half
*NL*
shutting
the
book
,
as
he
went
on
,
merely
to
shew
the
foundation
of
*NL*
the
natural
relation
between
a
father
and
his
child
;
the
right
and
*NL*
jurisdiction
over
whom
he
acquires
these
several
ways
--
*NL*
*NL*
1st
,
by
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
2d
,
by
adoption
.
*NL*
*NL*
3d
,
by
legitimation
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
4th
,
by
procreation
;
all
which
I
consider
in
their
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
lay
a
slight
stress
upon
one
of
them
,
replied
Yorick
--
the
act
,
*NL*
especially
where
it
ends
there
,
in
my
opinion
lays
as
little
obligation
*NL*
upon
the
child
,
as
it
conveys
power
to
the
father
.
--
You
are
wrong
,
--
said
*NL*
my
father
argutely
,
and
for
this
plain
reason
...
--
I
own
,
added
my
*NL*
father
,
that
the
offspring
,
upon
this
account
,
is
not
so
under
the
power
*NL*
and
jurisdiction
of
the
mother
.
--
But
the
reason
,
replied
Yorick
,
*NL*
equally
holds
good
for
her
.
--
She
is
under
authority
herself
,
said
my
*NL*
father
:
--
and
besides
,
continued
my
father
,
nodding
his
head
,
and
laying
*NL*
his
finger
upon
the
side
of
his
nose
,
as
he
assigned
his
reason
,
--
she
is
*NL*
not
the
principal
agent
,
Yorick
.
--
In
what
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
?
stopping
*NL*
his
pipe
.
--
Though
by
all
means
,
added
my
father
-LRB-
not
attending
to
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
-RRB-
,
`
The
son
ought
to
pay
her
respect
,
'
as
you
may
read
,
*NL*
Yorick
,
at
large
in
the
first
book
of
the
Institutes
of
Justinian
,
*NL*
at
the
eleventh
title
and
the
tenth
section

I
can
read
it

well

Yorick

in

Catechism

my
uncle
Toby

my
father
,
not
caring
to
be
interrupted
with
Trim
's
saying
his
*NL*
Catechism
.
He
can

upon
my
honour

replied
my

Ask

any

Commandment

said
Yorick
,
speaking
mildly

and
with
*NL*
a
gentle
nod

as
to
a
modest
Catechumen
.
The
corporal
stood
silent
.
--
You
*NL*
do
n't
ask
him
right
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
raising
his
voice

giving
*NL*
it
rapidly
like
the
word
of
command
:

my

Toby

I

*NL*
*NL*

Yorick
could
not
forbear
smiling
.
--
Your
reverence
does
not
consider
,
*NL*
said
the
corporal
,
shouldering
his
stick
like
a
musket
,
and
marching
*NL*
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
to
illustrate
his
position
,
--
that
't
is
*NL*
exactly
the
same
thing
,
as
doing
one

exercise
in
the
field
.

*NL*
*NL*
`
Join
your
right-hand

cried
the
corporal
,
giving
the
*NL*
word
of
command
,
and
performing
the
motion
.

*NL*
*NL*
`
Poise
your

cried
the
corporal
,
doing
the
duty
still
both
of
*NL*
adjutant
and
private
man
.

*NL*
`
Rest

my

setting

cried
my

Toby
,
waving
his
tobacco-pipe
,
as
he
would
*NL*
have
done
his
sword
at
the
head
of
a
regiment
.

The
corporal
went
*NL*
through
his
manual
with
exactness
;
and
having
honoured
his
father
and
*NL*
mother
,
made
a
low
bow
,
and
fell
back
to
the
side
of
the
room
.

Every

said
my

said
Yorick

He
*NL*
did
indeed

replied
my

Then

Trim

said
Yorick

springing

out

taking
the

by
the
hand
,
thou
art
the
best

commentator
upon

the
Decalogue
;
and
I
honour
thee
more
for

O
blessed
health

cried
my
father
,
making
an
exclamation
,
as
he
turned
*NL*
over
the
leaves
to
the
next
chapter
,
thou
art
before
all
gold
and
*NL*
treasure
;
't
is
thou
who
enlargest
the
soul
,

and
openest
all
its
powers
*NL*
to
receive
instruction
and
to
relish
virtue
.

He
that
has
thee
,
*NL*
has
little
more
to
wish
for
;
--
and
he
that
is
so
wretched
as
to
want
*NL*
thee
,
--
wants
every
thing
with
thee
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
concentrated
all
that
can
be
said
upon
this
important
head
,
said
*NL*
my
father
,
into
a
very
little
room
,
therefore
we
'll
read
the
chapter
*NL*
quite
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
read
as
follows
:
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
whole
secret
of
health
depending
upon
the
due
contention
for
*NL*
mastery
betwixt
the
radical
heat
and
the
radical
moisture
'
--
You
have
*NL*
proved
that
matter
of
fact
,
I
suppose
,
above
,
said
Yorick
.
Sufficiently
,
*NL*
replied
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
saying
this
,
my
father
shut
the
book
,
--
not
as
if
he
resolved
to
*NL*
read
no
more
of
it
,
for
he
kept
his
fore-finger
in
the
chapter
:
--
nor
*NL*
pettishly
,
--
for
he
shut
the
book
slowly
;
his
thumb
resting
,
when
he
*NL*
had
done
it
,
upon
the
upper-side
of
the
cover
,
as
his
three
fingers
*NL*
supported
the
lower
side
of
it
,
without
the
least
compressive
*NL*
violence
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
demonstrated
the
truth
of
that
point
,
quoth
my
father
,
nodding
to
*NL*
Yorick
,
most
sufficiently
in
the
preceding
chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
could
the
man
in

moon
be
told
,
that
a
man
in
the
earth
had
wrote
*NL*
a
chapter
,
sufficiently
demonstrating
,
That
the
secret
of
all
health
*NL*
depended
upon
the
due
contention
for
mastery
betwixt
the
radical
heat
*NL*
and
the

moisture
,
--
and
that
he
had
managed
the
point
so
well
,
*NL*
that
there
was
not
one
single
word
wet
or
dry
upon
radical
heat
or
*NL*
radical
moisture
,
throughout
the
whole
chapter
,
--
or
a
single
syllable
*NL*
in
it
,
pro

,
directly

upon

With
two
strokes
,
the
one
at
Hippocrates
,
the
other
at
Lord
Verulam
,
did
*NL*
my
father
achieve
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stroke
at
the
prince
of
physicians
,
with
which
he
began
,
was
no
more
*NL*
than
a
short
insult
upon
his
sorrowful
complaint
of
the
Ars
longa
,

and
*NL*
Vita
brevis
.
--
Life
short
,
cried
my
father
,
--
and
the
art
of
healing
*NL*
tedious
!
And
who
are
we
to
thank
for
both
the
one
and
the
other
,
but
*NL*
the
ignorance
of
quacks
themselves
,
--
and
the
stage-loads
of
chymical
*NL*
nostrums
,
and
peripatetic
lumber
,
with
which
,
in
all
ages
,
they
have
*NL*
first
flatter
'd
the
world
,
and
at
last
deceived
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
my
lord
Verulam
!
cried
my
father
,
turning
from
Hippocrates
,
and
*NL*
making
his
second
stroke
at
him
,
as
the
principal
of
nostrum-mongers
,
*NL*
and
the
fittest
to
be
made
an
example
of
to
the
rest
,
--
What
shall
I
*NL*
say
to
thee
,
my
great
lord
Verulam
?
What
shall
I
say
to
thy
internal
*NL*
spirit
,

thy
opium
,
thy
salt-petre
,
--
thy
greasy
unctions

purges
,

thy
nightly
clysters
,
and
succedaneums
?
*NL*
*NL*

My
father
was
never
at
a
loss
what
to
say
to
any
man
,
upon
any
*NL*
subject
;
and
had
the
least
occasion
for
the
exordium
of
any

*NL*
breathing
:
how
he
dealt
with
his
lordship
's
opinion
,

you
shall

see

know
not

's
*NL*
opinion
was

`
The
two
great
causes
,
which
conspire
with
each
other
to
shorten
life
,
*NL*
says
lord
Verulam
,
are
first
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
internal
spirit
,
which
like
a
gentle
flame
wastes
the
body
down
*NL*
to
death
:
--
And
secondly
,
the
external
air
,
that
parches
the
body
up
*NL*
to
ashes
:
--
which
two
enemies
attacking
us
on
both
sides
of
our
bodies
*NL*
together
,
at
length
destroy
our
organs
,
and
render
them
unfit
to
carry
*NL*
on
the
functions
of
life
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
being
the
state
of
the
case
,
the
road
to
longevity
was
plain
;
*NL*
nothing
more
being
required
,
says
his
lordship
,
but
to
repair
the
waste
*NL*
committed
by
the
internal
spirit
,
by
making
the
substance
of
it
more
*NL*
thick
and
dense
,
by
a
regular
course
of
opiates
on
one
side
,
and
by
*NL*
refrigerating
the
heat
of
it
on
the
other
,
by
three
grains
and
a
half
of
*NL*
salt-petre
every
morning
before
you
got
up
.

*NL*
*NL*
Still
this
frame
of
ours
was
left
exposed
to
the
inimical
assaults
of
*NL*
the
air
without
;
--
but
this
was
fenced
off
again
by
a
course
of
greasy
*NL*
unctions
,
which
so
fully
saturated
the
pores
of
the
skin
,
that
no
*NL*
spicula
could
enter
;
--
nor
could
any
one
get
out
.
--
This
put
a
stop
to
all
*NL*
perspiration
,
sensible
and
insensible
,
which
being
the
cause
of
so
*NL*
many
scurvy
distempers
--
a
course
of
clysters
was
requisite
to
carry
off
*NL*
redundant
humours
,

render
the
system
complete

What
my

had
to

to
my

greasy

Sufficeth
it
,
at

to
say
,
my

levelled
the
hypothesis

The
whole
secret
of
health
,
said
my
father
,
beginning
the
sentence
*NL*
again
,
depending
evidently
upon
the
due
contention
betwixt
the
radical
*NL*
heat
and
radical
moisture
within
us
;
--
the
least
imaginable
skill
had
*NL*
been
sufficient
to
have
maintained
it
,
had
not
the
school-men
confounded
*NL*
the
task
,
merely
-LRB-
as
Van
Helmont
,
the
famous
chymist
,
has
proved
-RRB-
by
all
*NL*
along
mistaking
the
radical
moisture
for
the
tallow
and
fat
of
animal
*NL*
bodies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
radical
moisture
is
not
the
tallow
or
fat
of
animals
,
but
an
*NL*
oily
and
balsamous
substance
;
for
the
fat
and
tallow
,
as
also
the
phlegm
*NL*
or
watery
parts
,
are
cold
;
whereas
the
oily
and
balsamous
parts
are
of
a
*NL*
lively
heat
and
spirit
,
which
accounts
for
the
observation
of
Aristotle
,
*NL*
`
Quod
omne
animal
post
coitum
est
triste
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
is
certain
,
that
the
radical
heat
lives
in
the
radical
moisture
,
*NL*
but
whether
vice
versa
,
is
a
doubt
:
however
,
when
the
one
decays
,
the
*NL*
other
decays
also
;
and
then
is
produced
,
either
an
unnatural
heat
,
which
*NL*
causes
an
unnatural
dryness
--
or
an
unnatural
moisture
,
which
causes
*NL*
dropsies
.
--
So
that
if
a
child
,
as
he
grows
up
,
can
but
be
taught
*NL*
to
avoid
running
into
fire
or
water
,
as
either
of
'em
threaten
his
*NL*
destruction
,
--
`
twill
be
all
that
is
needful
to
be
done
upon
that
head

The
description
of
the
siege
of
Jericho
itself
,
could
not
have
*NL*
engaged
the
attention
of
my
uncle
Toby
more
powerfully
than
the

chapter
;

his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
my
father
throughout
it
;

he
never
*NL*
mentioned
radical
heat
and
radical
moisture
,
but
my
uncle
Toby
took
his
*NL*
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
and
shook
his
head
;
and
as
soon
as
the
chapter
*NL*
was
finished
,
he
beckoned
to
the
corporal
to
come
close
to
his
chair
,
*NL*
to
ask
him
the
following
question
,
--
aside
.
--
...
It
was
at
the
siege
of
*NL*
Limerick
,
an

the
corporal
,
making
a
bow
.

The
poor
fellow
and
I
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
addressing
himself
to
my
*NL*
father
,
were
scarce
able
to
crawl
out
of
our
tents
,
at
the
time
the
*NL*
siege
of
Limerick
was
raised
,
upon
the
very
account
you
mention
.
--
Now
*NL*
what
can
have
got
into
that
precious
noddle
of
thine
,
my
dear
brother
*NL*
Toby
?
cried
my
father
,
mentally
.
--
By
Heaven
!
continued
he
,
communing
*NL*
still
with
himself
,
it
would
puzzle
an
Oedipus
to
bring
it
in
point
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
that
if
it
had
*NL*
not
been
for
the
quantity
of
brandy
we
set
fire
to
every
night
,
and
the
*NL*
claret
and
cinnamon
with
which
I
plyed
your
honour
off
;

And
the
geneva
,
*NL*
Trim
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
which
did
us
more
good
than
all

I
verily
*NL*
believe
,
continued
the
corporal
,
we
had
both
,
an

left
our
lives
in

trenches

cried
my

Toby
,
his
eyes
sparkling
as
he
*NL*
spoke
,
that
a
soldier
could
wish
to
lie
down
in

But
a
pitiful
death
*NL*
for
him
!
an

your
honour

replied
the
corporal
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
as
much
Arabick
to
my
father
,
as
the
rites
of
the
Colchi
*NL*
and
Troglodites
had
been
before
to
my

Toby
;
my
father
could
not

whether
he
was
to
frown
or
to
smile

My
uncle
Toby
,
turning
to
Yorick
,
resumed
the
case
at
Limerick
,
more
*NL*
intelligibly
than
he
had
begun
it
,

and
so
settled
the
point
for
my
*NL*
father
at
once

It
was
undoubtedly
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
a
great
happiness
for
myself
*NL*
and
the
corporal
,
that
we
had
all
along
a
burning
fever
,
attended
with
*NL*
a
most
raging
thirst
,
during
the
whole
five-and-twenty
days
the
flux
*NL*
was
upon
us
in
the
camp
;
otherwise
what
my
brother
calls
the
radical
*NL*
moisture
,
must
,
as
I
conceive
it
,
inevitably
have
got
the
better
.
--
My
*NL*
father
drew
in
his
lungs
top-full
of
air
,
and
looking
up
,
blew
it
forth
*NL*
again
,
as
slowly
as
he
possibly
could
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
was
Heaven
's
mercy
to
us
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
which
put
it
*NL*
into
the
corporal
's
head
to
maintain
that
due
contention
betwixt
the
*NL*
radical
heat
and
the
radical
moisture
,
by
reinforceing
the
fever
,
as
he
*NL*
did
all
along
,
with
hot
wine
and
spices
;
whereby
the
corporal
kept
up
*NL*
-LRB-
as
it
were
-RRB-
a
continual
firing
,
so
that
the
radical
heat
stood
its
*NL*
ground
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
,
and
was
a
fair
match
for
the
*NL*
moisture
,
terrible
as
it
was
.
--
Upon
my
honour
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
you
might
have
heard
the
contention
within
our
bodies
,
brother
Shandy
,
*NL*
twenty
toises
.

If
there
was
no
firing

said
Yorick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well

said
my
father
,
with
a
full
aspiration
,
and
pausing
a
while
after
*NL*
the
word
--
Was
I
a
judge
,
and
the
laws
of
the
country
which
made
me
one
*NL*
permitted
it
,
I
would
condemn
some
of
the
worst
malefactors
,
provided
*NL*
they
had
had
their
clergy
...
--
Yorick
,
foreseeing
the
sentence
was
likely
*NL*
to
end
with
no
sort
of
mercy
,
laid
his
hand
upon
my
father
's
breast
,
and
*NL*
begged
he
would
respite
it
for
a
few
minutes
,
till
he
asked
the
corporal
*NL*
a
question
.

Prithee

said
Yorick

staying
for
my
father
's

leave

tell

marched
up

Well

cried
my

sportively

of

his
passions
were
unaccountably
sudden
,

and
what
has
this
whelp
of
mine
*NL*
to
say
to
the
matter
?
*NL*
*NL*
Had
my

been
asking
after
the
amputation
of
the
tail
of
a
*NL*
puppy-dog

he
could
not
have
done
it
in
a
more
careless
air
:
the
system
*NL*
which
Dr.
Slop
had
laid
down
,
to
treat
the
accident
by

no
way
allowed
*NL*
of
such
a

sat
down

Pray

quoth
my

could

in

medical
lecture

The

made

the

of
which
was
begun
under
his

went
into

swampy

country

quite
surrounded
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
the
Shannon
,
*NL*
and
is
,
by
its
situation
,
one
of
the
strongest
fortified
places
in
*NL*
Ireland
.

*NL*
*NL*
I
think
this
is
a
new
fashion
,
quoth
Dr.
Slop
,
of
beginning
a
medical
*NL*
lecture
.
--
'T
is
all
true
,
answered
Trim
.

Then
I
wish
the
faculty
would
*NL*
follow
the
cut
of
it
,
said
Yorick
.

'T
is
all
cut
through

*NL*
your
reverence
,
said
the
corporal
,
with
drains
and
bogs
;
and
besides
,
*NL*
there
was
such
a
quantity
of
rain
fell
during
the
siege
,
the
whole
*NL*
country
was
like
a
puddle
,
--
't
was
that
,
and
nothing
else
,
which
brought
*NL*
on
the
flux
,
and
which
had
like
to
have
killed
both
his
honour
and
*NL*
myself
;
now
there
was
no
such
thing
,
after
the
first
ten
days
,
continued
*NL*
the
corporal
,
for
a
soldier
to
lie
dry
in
his
tent
,
without
cutting
a
*NL*
ditch
round
it
,
to
draw
off
the
water
;
--
nor
was
that
enough
,
for
those
*NL*
who
could
afford
it
,
as
his
honour
could
,
without
setting
fire
every
*NL*
night
to
a
pewter
dish
full
of
brandy
,
which
took
off
the
damp
of
the
*NL*
air
,
and
made
the
inside
of
the
tent
as
warm
as
a
stove
.

*NL*
*NL*
And
what
conclusion
dost
thou
draw
,
corporal
Trim
,
cried
my
father
,
from
*NL*
all
these
premises
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
infer
,
an
'

worship
,
replied
Trim
,
that
the
radical
*NL*
moisture
is
nothing
in
the
world
but
ditch-water
--
and
that
the
radical
*NL*
heat
,
of
those
who
can
go
to
the
expence
of
it
,
is
burnt
brandy
,
--
the
*NL*
radical
heat
and
moisture
of
a
private
man
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
is
*NL*
nothing
but
ditch-water

and
a
dram
of
geneva
--
and
give
us
but
enough
*NL*
of
it
,
with
a
pipe
of
tobacco
,
to
give
us
spirits
,
and
drive
away
the
*NL*
vapours
--
we
know
not
what
it
is
to
fear
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
at
a
loss
,
Captain
Shandy
,
quoth
Doctor
Slop
,
to
determine
in
which
*NL*
branch
of
learning
your
servant
shines
most
,
whether
in
physiology
or
*NL*
divinity
.
--
Slop
had
not
forgot
Trim
's
comment
upon
the
sermon
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
but
an
hour
ago
,
replied
Yorick
,
since
the
corporal
was
examined
*NL*
in
the
latter
,
and
passed
muster
with
great
honour
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
radical
heat
and
moisture
,
quoth
Doctor
Slop
,
turning
to
my
father
,
*NL*
you
must
know
,
is
the
basis
and
foundation
of
our
being
--
as
the
root
of
*NL*
a
tree
is
the
source
and
principle
of
its
vegetation
.
--
It
is
inherent
*NL*
in
the
seeds
of
all
animals
,
and
may
be
preserved
sundry
ways
,
*NL*
but
principally
in
my
opinion
by
consubstantials
,
impriments
,
and
*NL*
occludents
.

Now
this
poor
fellow
,
continued
Dr.
Slop
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
corporal
,
has
had
the
misfortune
to
have
heard
some
superficial
empiric
*NL*
discourse
upon
this
nice
point

That
he
has

said
my

A

lying

and
nothing
done

his

tools
sharpened

Was
not
the
great

Julius
Scaliger
within
an
ace
of
never
getting
his
tools
sharpened
at
*NL*
all
?
--
Forty-four
years
old
was
he
before
he
could
manage
his
Greek
;
--
and
*NL*
Peter
Damianus
,
lord
bishop
of
Ostia
,
as
all
the
world
knows
,
could
not
*NL*
so
much
as
read
,
when
he
was
of
man
's
estate
.
--
And
Baldus
himself
,
as
*NL*
eminent
as
he
turned
out
after
,
entered
upon
the
law
so
late
in
life
,
*NL*
that
every
body
imagined
he
intended
to
be
an
advocate
in
the
other
*NL*
world
:
no
wonder
,
when
Eudamidas
,
the
son
of
Archidamas
,
heard
*NL*
Xenocrates
at
seventy-five
disputing
about
wisdom
,
that
he
asked
*NL*
gravely
,
--
If
the
old
man
be
yet
disputing
and
enquiring
concerning
*NL*
wisdom
,
--
what
time
will
he
have
to
make
use
of
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yorick
listened
to
my
father
with
great
attention
;
there
was
a
seasoning
*NL*
of
wisdom
unaccountably
mixed
up
with
his
strangest
whims
,
and
he
had
*NL*
sometimes
such
illuminations
in
the
darkest
of
his
eclipses
,
as
almost
*NL*
atoned
for
them
:
--
be
wary
,
Sir
,
when
you
imitate
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
convinced
,
Yorick
,
continued
my
father
,
half
reading
and
half
*NL*
discoursing
,
that
there
is
a
North-west
passage
to
the
intellectual
*NL*
world
;
and
that
the
soul
of
man
has
shorter
ways
of
going
to
work
,
in
*NL*
furnishing
itself
with
knowledge
and
instruction
,
than
we
generally
take
*NL*
with
it
.
--
But
,
alack
!
all
fields
have
not
a
river
or
a
spring
running
*NL*
besides
them
;
--
every
child
,
Yorick
,
has
not
a
parent
to
point
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
whole
entirely
depends
,
added
my
father
,
in
a
low
voice
,
upon
the
*NL*
auxiliary
verbs
,
Mr.
Yorick
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Yorick
trod
upon
Virgil
's
snake
,
he
could
not
have
looked
more
*NL*
surprised
.
--
I
am
surprised
too
,
cried
my
father
,
observing
it
,
--
and
*NL*
I
reckon
it
as
one
of
the
greatest
calamities
which
ever
befel
the
*NL*
republic
of
letters
,
That
those
who
have
been
entrusted
with
the
*NL*
education
of
our
children
,
and
whose
business
it
was
to
open
their
*NL*
minds
,
and
stock
them
early
with
ideas
,
in
order
to
set
the
imagination
*NL*
loose
upon
them
,
have
made
so
little
use
of
the
auxiliary
verbs
in
doing
*NL*
it
,
as
they
have
done
--
So
that
,
except
Raymond
Lullius
,
and
the
elder
*NL*
Pelegrini
,
the
last
of
which
arrived
to
such
perfection
in
the
use
of
*NL*
'em
,
with
his
topics
,
that
,
in
a
few
lessons
,
he
could
teach
a
young
*NL*
gentleman
to
discourse
with
plausibility
upon
any
subject
,
pro
and
con
,
*NL*
and
to
say
and
write
all
that
could
be
spoken
or
written
concerning
it
,
*NL*
without
blotting
a
word
,
to
the
admiration
of
all
who
beheld
him
.
--
I
*NL*
should
be
glad
,
said
Yorick
,
interrupting
my
father
,
to
be
made
to
*NL*
comprehend
this
matter
.
You
shall
,
said
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
highest
stretch
of
improvement
a
single
word
is
capable
of
,
is
a
*NL*
high
metaphor
,
--
for
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
the
idea
is
generally
the
*NL*
worse
,
and
not
the
better
;
--
but
be
that
as
it
may
,
--
when
the
mind
*NL*
has
done
that
with
it
--
there
is
an
end
,
--
the
mind
and
the
idea
are
at
*NL*
rest
,
--
until
a
second
idea
enters
;
--
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
use
of
the
Auxiliaries
is
,
at
once
to
set
the
soul
a-going
*NL*
by
herself
upon
the
materials
as
they
are
brought
her
;
and
by
the
*NL*
versability
of
this
great
engine
,
round
which
they
are
twisted
,
to
open
*NL*
new
tracts
of
enquiry
,
and
make
every
idea
engender
millions
.

my

sat

The
verbs
auxiliary
we
are

my

And
these
varied
with

tenses
,
present
,
past
,
future
,
and
conjugated
with
the
verb
see
,

or
*NL*
with
these
questions
added
to
them
;

Is
it
?
Was
it

Will
it
be

Would
it
*NL*
be

May
it

Might
it

And
these
again
put
negatively
,
Is
it
not

*NL*
Was
it
not

Ought
it
not
?

Or
affirmatively
,
--
It
is
;
It
was
;
It
ought
to
*NL*
be
.
Or
chronologically
,
--
Has
it
been
always
?
Lately

How
long
ago
?

Or
*NL*
hypothetically
,

If
it
was

If
it
was
not

What
would
follow

If
the

French
should
beat

If
the

go

*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
by
the
right
use
and
application
of
these
,
continued
my
father
,
*NL*
in
which
a
child
's
memory
should
be
exercised
,
there
is
no
one
idea
can
*NL*
enter
his
brain
,
how
barren
soever
,

a
magazine
of
conceptions
and

conclusions
may
be
drawn
forth
from
it

cried
my

my

Did

How

us
as
we
passed
over

climbed
over

When
my
father
had
danced
his
white
bear
backwards
and
forwards
through
*NL*
half
a
dozen
pages
,
he
closed
the
book
for
good
an
'
all
,
--
and
in
a
kind
*NL*
of
triumph
redelivered
it
into
Trim
's
hand
,
with
a
nod
to
lay
it
upon
*NL*
the
`
scrutoire
,
where
he
found
it
.
--
Tristram
,
said
he
,
shall
be
made
to
*NL*
conjugate
every
word
in
the
dictionary
,
backwards
and
forwards
the
same
*NL*
way
;
--
every
word
,
Yorick
,
by
this
means
,
you
see
,
is
converted
into
a
*NL*
thesis
or
an
hypothesis
;
--
every
thesis
and
hypothesis
have
an
off-spring
*NL*
of
propositions
;
--
and
each
proposition
has
its
own
consequences
and
*NL*
conclusions
;
every
one
of
which
leads
the
mind
on
again
,
into
fresh
*NL*
tracks
of
enquiries
and
doubtings
.
--
The
force
of
this
engine
,
added
my
*NL*
father
,
is
incredible
in
opening
a
child
's
head
.
--
'T
is

Shandy

cried
my

Toby
,
to
burst
it
into

thousand
splinters

*NL*
*NL*
I
presume
,
said
Yorick
,
smiling
,
--
it
must
be
owing
to
this
,
--
-LRB-
for
let
*NL*
logicians
say
what
they
will
,
it
is
not
to
be
accounted
for
sufficiently
*NL*
from
the
bare
use
of
the
ten
predicaments
-RRB-
--
That
the
famous
Vincent
*NL*
Quirino
,
amongst
the
many
other
astonishing
feats
of
his
childhood
,
of
*NL*
which
the
Cardinal
Bembo
has
given
the
world
so
exact
a
story
,
--
should
*NL*
be
able
to
paste
up
in
the
public
schools
at
Rome
,
so
early
as
in
the
*NL*
eighth
year
of
his
age
,
no
less
than
four
thousand
five
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
different
theses
,
upon
the
most
abstruse
points
of
the
most
*NL*
abstruse
theology
;
--
and
to
defend
and
maintain
them
in
such
sort
,
as
to
*NL*
cramp
and
dumbfound
his
opponents
.
--
What
is
that
,
cried
my
father
,
to
*NL*
what
is
told
us
of
Alphonsus
Tostatus
,
who
,
almost
in
his
nurse
's
arms
,
*NL*
learned
all
the
sciences
and
liberal
arts
without
being
taught
any
one
*NL*
of
them
?
--
What
shall
we
say
of
the
great
Piereskius
?
--
That
's
the
very
*NL*
man
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
once
told
you
of
,
brother
Shandy
,
who
walked
*NL*
a
matter
of
five
hundred
miles
,
reckoning
from
Paris
to
Shevling
,
and
*NL*
from
Shevling
back
again
,
merely
to
see
Stevinus
's
flying
chariot
.
--
He
*NL*
was
a
very
great
man
!
added
my
uncle
Toby
-LRB-
meaning
Stevinus
-RRB-
--
He
was
so
,
*NL*
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
-LRB-
meaning
Piereskius
-RRB-
--
and
had
multiplied
*NL*
his
ideas
so
fast
,
and
increased
his
knowledge
to
such
a
prodigious
*NL*
stock
,
that
,
if
we
may
give
credit
to
an
anecdote
concerning
him
,
which
*NL*
we
can
not
withhold
here
,
without
shaking
the
authority
of
all
anecdotes
*NL*
whatever
--
at
seven
years
of
age
,
his
father
committed
entirely
to
*NL*
his
care
the
education
of
his
younger
brother
,
a
boy
of
five
years
*NL*
old
,
--
with
the
sole
management
of
all
his
concerns
.
--
Was
the
father
*NL*
as
wise
as
the
son
?
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
:
--
I
should
think
not
,
said
*NL*
Yorick
:
--
But
what
are
these
,
continued
my
father
--
-LRB-
breaking
out
in
a
*NL*
kind
of
enthusiasm
-RRB-
--
what
are
these
,
to
those
prodigies
of
childhood
*NL*
in
Grotius
,
Scioppius
,
Heinsius
,
Politian
,
Pascal
,
Joseph
Scaliger
,
*NL*
Ferdinand
de
Cordoue
,
and
others
--
some
of
which
left
off
their
*NL*
substantial
forms
at
nine
years
old
,
or
sooner
,
and
went
on
reasoning
*NL*
without
them
;
--
others
went
through
their
classics
at
seven
;
--
wrote
*NL*
tragedies
at
eight
;
--
Ferdinand
de
Cordoue
was
so
wise
at
nine
,
--
't
was
*NL*
thought
the
Devil
was
in
him
;
--
and
at
Venice
gave
such
proofs
of
his
*NL*
knowledge
and
goodness
,
that
the
monks
imagined
he
was
Antichrist
,
or
*NL*
nothing
.
--
Others
were
masters
of
fourteen
languages
at
ten
,
--
finished
*NL*
the
course
of
their
rhetoric
,
poetry
,
logic
,
and
ethics
,
at
eleven
,
--
put
*NL*
forth
their
commentaries
upon
Servius
and
Martianus
Capella
at
*NL*
twelve
,
--
and
at
thirteen
received
their
degrees
in
philosophy

When

a
scruple
of
decorum
had
unseasonably
rose
*NL*
up
in
Susannah
's
conscience
,
about
holding
the
candle
,
whilst
Slop
tied
*NL*
it
on

Slop
had
not
treated
Susannah

with
anodynes

so
*NL*
a
quarrel
had
ensued
betwixt

*NL*
*NL*
--
Oh

said
Slop
,
casting
a
glance
of
undue
freedom
in
Susannah
's
*NL*
face
,
as
she
declined
the
office
;
--
then
,
I
think
I
know
you
,
madam
--
You
*NL*
know
me
,
Sir
!
cried
Susannah
fastidiously
,
and
with
a
toss
of
her
*NL*
head
,
levelled
evidently
,
not
at
his
profession
,
but
at
the
doctor
*NL*
himself
,
--
you
know
me
!
cried
Susannah
again
.
--
Doctor
Slop
clapped
his
*NL*
finger
and
his
thumb
instantly
upon
his
nostrils
;
--
Susannah
's
spleen
*NL*
was
ready
to
burst
at
it
;
--
'T
is
false
,
said
Susannah
.
--
Come
,
come
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Modesty
,
said
Slop
,
not
a
little
elated
with
the
success
of
his
last
*NL*
thrust
,
--
If
you
wo
n't
hold
the
candle
,
and
look
--
you
may
hold
it
and
*NL*
shut
your
eyes
:
--
That
's
one
of
your
popish
shifts
,
cried
Susannah
:
--
'T
is
*NL*
better
,
said
Slop
,
with
a
nod
,
than
no
shift
at
all
,
young
woman
;
--
I
*NL*
defy
you
,
Sir
,
cried
Susannah
,
pulling
her
shift
sleeve
below
her
elbow
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
almost
impossible
for
two
persons
to
assist
each
other
in
a
*NL*
surgical
case
with
a
more
splenetic
cordiality
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slop
snatched
up
the
cataplasm
--
Susannah
snatched
up
the
candle
;
--
A
*NL*
little
this
way
,
said
Slop
;
Susannah
looking
one
way
,
and
rowing
*NL*
another
,
instantly
set
fire
to
Slop
's
wig
,
which
being
somewhat
bushy
*NL*
and
unctuous
withal
,
was
burnt
out
before
it
was
well
kindled
.
--
You
*NL*
impudent
whore
!
cried
Slop
,

-LRB-
for
what
is
passion
,
but
a
wild
*NL*
beast
?
-RRB-
--
you
impudent
whore
,
cried
Slop
,
getting
upright
,
with
the
*NL*
cataplasm
in
his
hand
;
--
I
never
was
the
destruction
of
any
body
's
nose
,
*NL*
said
Susannah
,
--
which
is
more
than
you
can
say
:
--
Is
it
?
cried
Slop
,
*NL*
throwing
the
cataplasm
in
her
face
;
--
Yes
,
it
is

cried
Susannah
,

returning
the
compliment
with
what
was
left
in

pan

Doctor
Slop

filed
cross-bills
against
each
other
in
the
*NL*
parlour
;
which
done
,
as
the
cataplasm
had
failed
,
they
retired
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
to
prepare
a
fomentation
for
me
;
--
and
whilst
that
was
doing
,
my
*NL*
father
determined
the
point
as

read

*NL*
*NL*
You
see
't
is
high
time
,
said
my
father
,
addressing
himself
equally
to
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
and
Yorick
,
to
take
this
young
creature
out
of
these
women
's
*NL*
hands
,
and
put
him
into
those
of
a
private
governor
.
Marcus
Antoninus
*NL*
provided
fourteen
governors
all
at
once
to
superintend
his
son
*NL*
Commodus
's
education
,
--
and
in
six
weeks
he
cashiered
five
of
them
;
--
I
*NL*
know
very
well
,
continued
my
father
,
that
Commodus
's
mother
was
in
love
*NL*
with
a
gladiator
at
the
time
of
her
conception
,
which
accounts
for
a
*NL*
great
many
of
Commodus
's
cruelties
when
he
became
emperor
;
--
but
still
I
*NL*
am
of
opinion
,
that
those
five
whom
Antoninus
dismissed
,
did
Commodus
's
*NL*
temper
,
in
that
short
time
,
more
hurt
than
the
other
nine
were
able
to
*NL*
rectify
all
their
lives
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
as
I
consider
the
person
who
is
to
be
about
my
son
,
as
the
mirror
*NL*
in
which
he
is
to
view
himself
from
morning
to
night
,
by
which
he
is
to
*NL*
adjust
his
looks
,
his
carriage
,
and
perhaps
the
inmost
sentiments
of
his
*NL*
heart
;
--
I
would
have
one
,
Yorick
,
if
possible
,
polished
at
all
points
,
*NL*
fit
for
my
child
to
look
into
.
--
This
is
very
good
sense
,
quoth
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
is
,
continued
my
father
,
a
certain
mien
and
motion
of
the
body
*NL*
and
all
its
parts
,
both
in
acting
and
speaking
,
which
argues
a
man
well
*NL*
within
;
and
I
am
not
at
all
surprised
that
Gregory
of
Nazianzum
,
upon
*NL*
observing
the
hasty
and
untoward
gestures
of
Julian
,
should
foretel
he
*NL*
would
one
day
become
an
apostate
;
--
or
that
St.
Ambrose
should
turn
his
*NL*
Amanuensis
out
of
doors
,
because
of
an
indecent
motion
of
his
head
,
*NL*
which
went
backwards
and
forwards
like
a
flail
;
--
or
that
Democritus
*NL*
should
conceive
Protagoras
to
be
a
scholar
,
from
seeing
him
bind
up
a
*NL*
faggot
,
and
thrusting
,
as
he
did
it
,
the
small
twigs
inwards
.
--
There
*NL*
are
a
thousand
unnoticed
openings
,
continued
my
father
,
which
let
a
*NL*
penetrating
eye
at
once
into
a
man
's
soul
;
and
I
maintain
it
,
added
he
,
*NL*
that
a
man
of
sense
does
not
lay
down
his
hat
in
coming
into
a
room
,
--
or

take
it
up
in
going
out
of

but
something
escapes
,
which
discovers
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
for
these
reasons
,
continued
my
father
,
that
the
governor
I
make
*NL*
choice
of
shall
neither
-LRB-

lisp
,
or
squint
,
or
wink
,
or
*NL*
talk
loud
,
or
look
fierce
,
or
foolish
;
--
or
bite
his
lips
,
or
grind
*NL*
his
teeth
,
or
speak
through
his
nose
,
or
pick
it
,
or
blow
it
with
his
*NL*
fingers
.
--
He
shall
neither
walk
fast
,
--
or
slow
,
or
fold
his
arms
,
--
for
*NL*
that
is
laziness
;
--
or
hang
them
down
,
--
for
that
is
folly
;
or
hide
them
*NL*
in
his
pocket
,
for
that
is
nonsense
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
He
shall
neither
strike
,
or
pinch
,
or
tickle
--
or
bite
,
or
cut
his
*NL*
nails
,
or
hawk
,
or
spit
,
or
snift
,
or
drum
with
his
feet
or
fingers
in
*NL*
company
;
--
nor
-LRB-
according
to
Erasmus
-RRB-
shall
he
speak
to
any
one
in
making
*NL*
water
,
--
nor
shall
he
point
to
carrion
or
excrement
.
--
Now
this
is
all
*NL*
nonsense
again
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
to
himself
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
have
him
,
continued
my
father
,
cheerful
,
facete
,
jovial
;
at
the
*NL*
same
time
,
prudent
,
attentive
to
business
,
vigilant
,
acute
,
argute
,
*NL*
inventive
,
quick
in
resolving
doubts
and
speculative
questions
;
--
he
*NL*
shall
be
wise
,
and
judicious
,
and
learned
:
--
And
why
not
humble
,
and
*NL*
moderate
,
and
gentle-tempered
,
and
good
?
said
Yorick
:
--
And
why
not
,
*NL*
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
free
,
and
generous
,
and
bountiful
,
and
brave
?
--
He
*NL*
shall
,
my
dear
Toby
,
replied
my
father
,
getting
up
and
shaking
him
by
*NL*
his
hand
.
--
Then
,
brother
Shandy
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
,
raising
himself
*NL*
off
the
chair
,
and
laying
down
his
pipe
to
take
hold
of
my
father
's
*NL*
other
hand
,
--
I
humbly
beg
I
may
recommend
poor
Le
Fever
's
son
to
you
;
--
a
*NL*
tear
of
joy
of
the
first
water
sparkled
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
eye
,
and
*NL*
another
,
the
fellow
to
it
,
in
the
corporal
's
,
as
the
proposition
was
*NL*
made
;
--
you
will
see
why
when
you
read
Le
Fever
's
story
:
--
fool
that
I
*NL*
was
!
nor
can
I
recollect
-LRB-
nor
perhaps
you
-RRB-
without
turning
back
to
the
*NL*
place
,
what
it
was
that
hindered
me
from
letting
the
corporal
tell
it
in
*NL*
his
own
words
;
--
but
the
occasion
is
lost
,
--
I
must
tell
it
now
in

*NL*
The
Story
of
Le
Fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
time
in
the
summer
of
that
year
in
which
Dendermond
was
*NL*
taken
by
the
allies
,
--
which
was
about
seven
years
before
my
father
came
*NL*
into
the
country
,
--
and
about
as
many
,
after
the
time
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
and
Trim
had
privately
decamped
from
my
father
's
house
in
town
,
in
order
*NL*
to
lay
some
of
the
finest
sieges
to
some
of
the
finest
fortified
cities
*NL*
in
Europe
--
when
my
uncle
Toby
was
one
evening
getting
his
supper
,
with
*NL*
Trim
sitting
behind
him
at
a
small
sideboard
,
--
I
say
,
sitting
--
for
in
*NL*
consideration
of
the
corporal
's
lame
knee
-LRB-
which
sometimes
gave
him
*NL*
exquisite
pain
-RRB-
--
when
my
uncle
Toby
dined
or
supped
alone
,
he
would
*NL*
never
suffer
the
corporal
to
stand
;
and
the
poor
fellow
's
veneration
for
*NL*
his
master
was
such
,
that
,
with
a
proper
artillery
,
my
uncle
Toby
could
*NL*
have
taken
Dendermond
itself
,
with
less
trouble
than
he
was
able
to
gain
*NL*
this
point
over
him
;
for
many
a
time
when
my
uncle
Toby
supposed
the
*NL*
corporal
's
leg
was
at
rest
,
he
would
look
back
,
and
detect
him
standing
*NL*
behind
him
with
the
most
dutiful
respect
:
this
bred
more
little
*NL*
squabbles
betwixt
them
,
than
all
other
causes
for
five-and-twenty
years
*NL*
together
--
But
this
is
neither
here
nor
there
--
why
do
I
mention
it
?
--
Ask
*NL*
my
pen
,
--
it
governs
me
,
--
I
govern
not
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
one
evening
sitting
thus
at
his
supper
,
when
the
landlord
of
a
*NL*
little
inn
in
the
village
came
into
the
parlour
,
with
an
empty
phial
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
to
beg
a
glass
or
two
of
sack
;
'T
is
for
a
poor
gentleman
,
--
I
*NL*
think
,
of
the
army
,
said
the
landlord
,
who
has
been
taken
ill
at
my
*NL*
house
four
days
ago
,
and
has
never
held
up
his
head
since
,
or
had
a
*NL*
desire
to
taste
any
thing
,
till
just
now
,
that
he
has
a
fancy
for
a
*NL*
glass
of
sack
and
a
thin
toast
,
--
I
think
,
says
he
,
taking
his
hand
from
*NL*
his
forehead
,
it
would
comfort
me
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
If
I
could
neither
beg
,
borrow
,
or
buy
such
a
thing
--
added
the
*NL*
landlord
,
--
I
would
almost
steal
it
for
the
poor
gentleman
,
he
is
so
*NL*
ill
.
--
I
hope
in
God
he
will
still
mend
,
continued
he
,
--
we
are
all
of
us
*NL*
concerned
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thou
art
a
good-natured
soul
,
I
will
answer
for
thee
,
cried
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
;
and
thou
shalt
drink
the
poor
gentleman
's
health
in
a
glass
of
*NL*
sack
thyself
,
--
and
take
a
couple
of
bottles
with
my
service
,
and
tell
*NL*
him
he
is
heartily
welcome
to
them
,
and
to
a
dozen
more
if
they
will
do
*NL*
him
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
I
am
persuaded
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
the
landlord
shut
the
*NL*
door
,
he
is
a
very
compassionate
fellow
--
Trim
,
--
yet
I
can
not
help
*NL*
entertaining
a
high
opinion
of
his
guest
too
;
there
must
be
something
*NL*
more
than
common
in
him
,
that
in
so
short
a
time
should
win
so
much
*NL*
upon
the
affections
of
his
host
;
--
And
of
his
whole
family
,
added
the
*NL*
corporal
,
for
they
are
all
concerned
for
him
,
.
--
Step
after
him
,
said
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
--
do
Trim
,
--
and
ask
if
he
knows
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
have
quite
forgot
it
truly
,
said
the
landlord
,
coming
back
into
the
*NL*
parlour
with
the
corporal
,
--
but
I
can
ask
his
son
again
:
--
Has
he
a
son
*NL*
with
him
then
?
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
A
boy
,
replied
the
landlord
,
of
*NL*
about
eleven
or
twelve
years
of
age
;
--
but
the
poor
creature
has
tasted
*NL*
almost
as
little
as
his
father
;
he
does
nothing
but
mourn
and
lament
for
*NL*
him
night
and
day
:
--
He
has
not
stirred
from
the
bed-side
these
two
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
laid
down
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
thrust
his
plate
from
*NL*
before
him
,
as
the
landlord
gave
him
the
account
;
and
Trim
,
without
*NL*
being
ordered
,
took
away
,
without
saying
one
word
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
*NL*
after
brought
him
his
pipe
and
tobacco
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Stay
in
the
room
a
little
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Trim
!
--
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
after
he
lighted
his
pipe
,
and
smoak
'd
about
*NL*
a
dozen
whiffs
.
--
Trim
came
in
front
of
his
master
,
and
made
his
bow
;
--
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
smoak
'd
on
,
and
said
no
more
.
--
Corporal
!
said
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
--
the
corporal
made
his
bow
.
--
My
uncle
Toby
proceeded
no
farther
,
*NL*
but
finished
his
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Trim
!
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
have
a
project
in
my
head
,
as
it
is
a
bad
*NL*
night
,
of
wrapping
myself
up
warm
in
my
roquelaure
,
and
paying
a
visit
*NL*
to
this
poor
gentleman
.
--
Your
honour
's
roquelaure
,
replied
the
corporal
,
*NL*
has
not
once
been
had
on
,
since
the
night
before
your
honour
received
*NL*
your
wound
,
when
we
mounted
guard
in
the
trenches
before
the
gate
of
St.
*NL*
Nicholas
;
--
and
besides
,
it
is
so
cold
and
rainy
a
night
,
that
what
with
*NL*
the
roquelaure
,
and
what
with
the
weather
,
`
twill
be
enough
to
give
your
*NL*
honour
your
death
,
and
bring
on
your
honour
's
torment
in
your
groin
.
I
*NL*
fear
so
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
;
but
I
am
not
at
rest
in
my
mind
,
Trim
,
*NL*
since
the
account
the
landlord
has
given
me
.
--
I
wish
I
had
not
known
so
*NL*
much
of
this
affair
,
--
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
or
that
I
had
known
more
of
*NL*
it
:
--
How
shall
we
manage
it
?
Leave
it
,
a
n't
please
your
honour
,
to
me
,
*NL*
quoth
the
corporal
;
--
I
'll
take
my
hat
and
stick
and
go
to
the
house
and
*NL*
reconnoitre
,
and
act
accordingly
;
and
I
will
bring
your
honour
a
full
*NL*
account
in
an
hour
.
--
Thou
shalt
go
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
here
's
*NL*
a
shilling
for
thee
to
drink
with
his
servant
.
--
I
shall
get
it
all
out
*NL*
of
him
,
said
the
corporal
,
shutting
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
filled
his
second
pipe
;
and
had
it
not
been
,
that
he
now
*NL*
and
then
wandered
from
the
point
,
with
considering
whether
it
was
not
*NL*
full
as
well
to
have
the
curtain
of
the
tennaile
a
straight
line
,
as
a
*NL*
crooked
one
,
--
he
might
be
said
to
have
thought
of
nothing
else
but
poor
*NL*
Le
Fever
and
his
boy
the
whole
time
he
smoaked
it
.

Continued

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
till
my
uncle
Toby
had
knocked
the
ashes
out
of
his
third
*NL*
pipe
,
that
corporal
Trim
returned
from
the
inn
,
and
gave
him
the
*NL*
following
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
despaired
,
at
first
,
said
the
corporal
,
of
being
able
to
bring
*NL*
back
your
honour
any
kind
of
intelligence
concerning
the
poor
sick
*NL*
lieutenant
--
Is
he
in
the
army
,
then
?
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
He
is
,
said
*NL*
the
corporal
--
And
in
what
regiment
?
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
I
'll
tell
your
*NL*
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
,
every
thing
straight
forwards
,
as
I
learnt
*NL*
it
.
--
Then
,
Trim
,
I
'll
fill
another
pipe
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
not
*NL*
interrupt
thee
till
thou
hast
done
;
so
sit
down
at
thy
ease
,
Trim
,
in
*NL*
the
window-seat
,
and
begin
thy
story
again
.
The
corporal
made
his
old
*NL*
bow
,
which
generally
spoke
as
plain
as
a
bow
could
speak
it
--
Your
honour
*NL*
is
good
:
--
And
having
done
that
,
he
sat
down
,
as
he
was
ordered
,
--
and
*NL*
begun
the
story
to
my
uncle
Toby
over
again
in
pretty
near
the
same
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
despaired
at
first
,
said
the
corporal
,
of
being
able
to
bring
back
any
*NL*
intelligence
to
your
honour
,
about
the
lieutenant
and
his
son
;
for
when
*NL*
I
asked
where
his
servant
was
,
from
whom
I
made
myself
sure
of
knowing
*NL*
every
thing
which
was
proper
to
be
asked
,
--
That
's
a
right
distinction
,
*NL*
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
I
was
answered
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
that
*NL*
he
had
no
servant
with
him
;
--
that
he
had
come
to
the
inn
with
hired
*NL*
horses
,
which
,
upon
finding
himself
unable
to
proceed
-LRB-
to
join
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
the
regiment
-RRB-
,
he
had
dismissed
the
morning
after
he
came
.
--
If
*NL*
I
get
better
,
my
dear
,
said
he
,
as
he
gave
his
purse
to
his
son
to
pay
*NL*
the
man
,
--
we
can
hire
horses
from
hence
.
--
But
alas
!
the
poor
gentleman
*NL*
will
never
get
from
hence
,
said
the
landlady
to
me
,
--
for
I
heard
the
*NL*
death-watch
all
night
long
;
--
and
when
he
dies
,
the
youth
,
his
son
,
will
*NL*
certainly
die
with
him
;
for
he
is
broken-hearted
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
hearing
this
account
,
continued
the
corporal
,
when
the
youth
came
*NL*
into
the
kitchen
,
to
order
the
thin
toast
the
landlord
spoke
of
;
--
but
I
*NL*
will
do
it
for
my
father
myself
,
said
the
youth
.
--
Pray
let
my
save
you
*NL*
the
trouble
,
young
gentleman
,
said
I
,
taking
up
a
fork
for
the
purpose
,
*NL*
and
offering
him
my
chair
to
sit
down
upon
by
the
fire
,
whilst
I
did
*NL*
it
.
--
I
believe
,
Sir
,
said
he
,
very
modestly
,
I
can
please
him
best
*NL*
myself
.
--
I
am
sure
,
said
I
,
his
honour
will
not
like
the
toast
the
worse
*NL*
for
being
toasted
by
an
old
soldier
.
--
The
youth
took
hold
of
my
hand
,
*NL*
and
instantly
burst
into
tears
.
--
Poor
youth
!
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
he
*NL*
has
been
bred
up
from
an
infant
in
the
army
,
and
the
name
of
a
soldier
,
*NL*
Trim
,
sounded
in
his
ears
like
the
name
of
a
friend
;
--
I
wish
I
had
him
*NL*
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
never
,
in
the
longest
march
,
said
the
corporal
,
had
so
great
a
mind
*NL*
to
my
dinner
,
as
I
had
to
cry
with
him
for

What
could
be
the
*NL*
matter
with
me
,
an
'
please
your
honour
?
Nothing
in
the
world
,
Trim
,
*NL*
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
blowing
his
nose
,
--
but
that
thou
art
a
good-natured
*NL*
fellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
gave
him
the
toast
,
continued
the
corporal
,
I
thought
it
was
*NL*
proper
to
tell
him
I
was
captain
Shandy
's
servant
,
and
that
your
honour
*NL*
-LRB-
though
a
stranger
-RRB-
was
extremely
concerned
for
his
father
;
--
and
that
*NL*
if
there
was
any
thing
in
your
house
or
cellar
--
-LRB-
And
thou
might
`
st
have
*NL*
added
my
purse
too
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
-RRB-
,
--
he
was
heartily
welcome
to
*NL*
it
:
--
He
made
a
very
low
bow
-LRB-
which
was
meant
to
your
honour
-RRB-
,
but
no
*NL*
answer
--
for
his
heart
was
full
--
so
he
went
up
stairs
with
the
toast
;
--
I
*NL*
warrant
you
,
my
dear
,
said
I
,
as
I
opened
the
kitchen-door
,
your
father
*NL*
will
be
well
again
.
--
Mr.
Yorick
's
curate
was
smoking
a
pipe
by
the
*NL*
kitchen
fire
,
--
but
said
not
a
word
good
or
bad
to
comfort
the
youth
.
--
I
*NL*
thought
it
wrong
;
added
the
corporal
--
I
think
so
too
,
said
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
lieutenant
had
taken
his
glass
of
sack
and
toast
,
he
felt
*NL*
himself
a
little
revived
,
and
sent
down
into
the
kitchen
,
to
let
me
*NL*
know
,
that
in
about
ten
minutes
he
should
be
glad
if
I
would
step
*NL*
up
stairs
.
--
I
believe
,
said
the
landlord
,
he
is
going
to
say
his
*NL*
prayers
,
--
for
there
was
a
book
laid
upon
the
chair
by
his
bed-side
,
and
*NL*
as
I
shut
the
door
,
I
saw
his
son
take
up
a
cushion
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
,
said
the
curate
,
that
you
gentlemen
of
the
army
,
Mr.
Trim
,
*NL*
never
said
your
prayers
at
all
.
--
I
heard
the
poor
gentleman
say
his
*NL*
prayers
last
night
,
said
the
landlady
,
very
devoutly
,
and
with
my
own
*NL*
ears
,
or
I
could
not
have
believed
it
.
--
Are
you
sure
of
it
?
replied
the
*NL*
curate
.
--
A
soldier
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
said
I
,
prays
as
often
*NL*
-LRB-
of
his
own
accord
-RRB-
as
a
parson
;
--
and
when
he
is
fighting
for
his
king
,
*NL*
and
for
his
own
life
,
and
for
his
honour
too
,
he
has
the
most
reason
*NL*
to
pray
to
God
of
any
one
in
the
whole
world
--
'T
was
well
said
of
thee
,
*NL*
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
But
when
a
soldier
,
said
I
,
an
'
please
your
*NL*
reverence
,
has
been
standing
for
twelve
hours
together
in
the
trenches
,
*NL*
up
to
his
knees
in
cold
water
,
--
or
engaged
,
said
I
,
for
months
*NL*
together
in
long
and
dangerous
marches
;
--
harassed
,
perhaps
,
in
his
rear
*NL*
to-day
;
--
harassing
others
to-morrow
;
--
detached
here
;
--
countermanded
*NL*
there
;
--
resting
this
night
out
upon
his
arms
;
--
beat
up
in
his
shirt
the
*NL*
next
;
--
benumbed
in
his
joints
;
--
perhaps
without
straw
in
his
tent
to
*NL*
kneel
on
;
--
must
say
his
prayers
how
and
when
he
can
.
--
I
believe
,
said
*NL*
I
,
--
for
I
was
piqued
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
for
the
reputation
of
the
*NL*
army
,
--
I
believe
,
an
'
please
your
reverence
,
said
I
,
that
when
a
soldier
*NL*
gets
time
to
pray
,
--
he
prays
as
heartily
as
a
parson
,
--
though
not
with
*NL*
all
his
fuss
and
hypocrisy
.
--
Thou
shouldst
not
have
said
that
,
Trim
,
*NL*
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
for
God
only
knows
who
is
a
hypocrite
,
and
who
is
*NL*
not
:
--
At
the
great
and
general
review
of
us
all
,
corporal
,
at
the
day
of
*NL*
judgment
-LRB-
and
not
till
then
-RRB-
--
it
will
be
seen
who
has
done
their
*NL*
duties
in
this
world
,
--
and
who
has
not
;
and
we
shall
be
advanced
,
Trim
,
*NL*
accordingly
.
--
I
hope
we
shall
,
said
Trim
.
--
It
is
in
the
Scripture
,
said
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
;
and
I
will
shew
it
thee
to-morrow
:
--
In
the
mean
time
we
*NL*
may
depend
upon
it
,
Trim
,
for
our
comfort
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
God
*NL*
Almighty
is
so
good
and
just
a
governor
of
the
world
,
that
if
we
have
*NL*
but
done
our
duties
in
it
,
--
it
will
never
be
enquired
into
,
whether
*NL*
we
have
done
them
in
a
red
coat
or
a
black
one
:
--
I
hope
not
,
said
the
*NL*
corporal
--
But
go
on
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
thy
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
went
up
,
continued
the
corporal
,
into
the
lieutenant
's
room
,
*NL*
which
I
did
not
do
till
the
expiration
of
the
ten
minutes
,
--
he
was
lying
*NL*
in
his
bed
with
his
head
raised
upon
his
hand
,
with
his
elbow
upon
the
*NL*
pillow
,
and
a
clean
white
cambrick
handkerchief
beside
it
:
--
The
youth
*NL*
was
just
stooping
down
to
take
up
the
cushion
,
upon
which
I
supposed
he
*NL*
had
been
kneeling
,
--
the
book
was
laid
upon
the
bed
,
--
and
,
as
he
rose
,
in
*NL*
taking
up
the
cushion
with
one
hand
,
he
reached
out
his
other
to
take
*NL*
it
away
at
the
same
time
.
--
Let
it
remain
there
,
my
dear
,
said
the
*NL*
lieutenant
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
offer
to
speak
to
me
,
till
I
had
walked
up
close
to
his
*NL*
bed-side
:
--
If
you
are
captain
Shandy
's
servant
,
said
he
,
you
must
*NL*
present
my
thanks
to
your
master
,
with
my
little
boy
's
thanks
along
*NL*
with
them
,
for
his
courtesy
to
me
;
--
if
he
was
of
Levens
's
--
said
the
*NL*
lieutenant
.
--
I
told
him
your
honour
was
--
Then
,
said
he
,
I
served
three
*NL*
campaigns
with
him
in
Flanders
,
and
remember
him
,
--
but
't
is
most
likely
,
*NL*
as
I
had
not
the
honour
of
any
acquaintance
with
him
,
that
he
knows
*NL*
nothing
of
me
.
--
You
will
tell
him
,
however
,
that
the
person
his
*NL*
good-nature
has
laid
under
obligations
to
him
,
is
one
Le
Fever
,
a
*NL*
lieutenant
in
Angus
's
--
but
he
knows
me
not
,
--
said
he
,
a
second
time
,
*NL*
musing
;
--
possibly
he
may
my
story
--
added
he
--
pray
tell
the
captain
,
I
*NL*
was
the
ensign
at
Breda
,
whose
wife
was
most
unfortunately
killed
with
*NL*
a
musket-shot
,
as
she
lay
in
my
arms
in
my
tent
.
--
I
remember
the
story
,
*NL*
a
n't
please
your
honour
,
said
I
,
very
well
.
--
Do
you
so
?
said
he
,
wiping
*NL*
his
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
--
then
well
may
I.
--
In
saying
this
,
he
*NL*
drew
a
little
ring
out
of
his
bosom
,
which
seemed
tied
with
a
black
*NL*
ribband
about
his
neck
,
and
kiss
'd
it
twice
--
Here
,
Billy
,
said
he
,
--
the
*NL*
boy
flew
across
the
room
to
the
bed-side
,
--
and
falling
down
upon
his
*NL*
knee
,
took
the
ring
in
his
hand
,
and
kissed
it
too
,
--
then
kissed
his
*NL*
father
,
and
sat
down
upon
the
bed
and
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
a
deep
sigh
,
--
I
wish
,
Trim
,
I
was
*NL*
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
,
is
too
much
concerned
;
--
shall
I
pour
*NL*
your
honour
out
a
glass
of
sack
to
your
pipe
?
--
Do
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
sighing
again
,
the
story
of
the
ensign
*NL*
and
his
wife
,
with
a
circumstance
his
modesty
omitted
;
--
and
particularly
*NL*
well
that
he
,
as
well
as
she
,
upon
some
account
or
other
-LRB-
I
forget
what
-RRB-
*NL*
was
universally
pitied
by
the
whole
regiment
;
--
but
finish
the
story
thou
*NL*
art
upon
:
--
'T
is
finished
already
,
said
the
corporal
,
--
for
I
could
stay
*NL*
no
longer
,
--
so
wished
his
honour
a
good
night
;
young
Le
Fever
rose
from
*NL*
off
the
bed
,
and
saw
me
to
the
bottom
of
the
stairs
;
and
as
we
went
down
*NL*
together
,
told
me
,
they
had
come
from
Ireland
,
and
were
on
their
route
*NL*
to
join
the
regiment
in
Flanders
.
--
But
alas
!
said
the
corporal
,
--
the
*NL*
lieutenant
's
last
day
's
march
is
over
.
--
Then
what
is
to
become
of
his
*NL*
poor
boy
?

The

Continued

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
eternal
honour
,

though
I
tell
it
only
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
those
,
who
,
when
coop

law

know
not
,
for
their
souls
,
which
way
in
the
world
to
turn
*NL*
themselves
--
That
notwithstanding
my
uncle
Toby
was
warmly
engaged
at
*NL*
that
time
in
carrying
on
the
siege
of
Dendermond
,
parallel
with
the
*NL*
allies
,
who
pressed
theirs
on
so
vigorously
,
that
they
scarce
allowed
*NL*
him
time
to
get
his
dinner
--
that
nevertheless
he
gave
up
Dendermond
,
*NL*
though
he
had
already
made
a
lodgment
upon
the
counterscarp
;
--
and
bent
*NL*
his
whole
thoughts
towards
the
private
distresses
at
the
inn
;
and
except
*NL*
that
he
ordered
the
garden
gate
to
be
bolted
up
,
by
which
he
might
be
*NL*
said
to
have
turned
the
siege
of
Dendermond
into
a
blockade
,
--
he
left
*NL*
Dendermond
to
itself
--
to
be
relieved
or
not
by
the
French
king
,
as
the
*NL*
French
king
thought
good
;
and
only
considered
how
he
himself
should
*NL*
relieve
the
poor
lieutenant
and
his
son
.

That

Being

shall
recompence
*NL*
thee
for
this

*NL*
*NL*
Thou
hast
left
this

short
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
to
the
corporal
,
as
*NL*
he
was
putting
him
to
bed
,

and
I
will
tell
thee
in
what
,
Trim
.
--
In
the
*NL*
first
place
,
when
thou
madest
an
offer
of
my
services
to
Le
Fever
,
--
as
*NL*
sickness
and
travelling
are
both
expensive
,
and
thou
knowest
he
was
but
*NL*
a
poor
lieutenant
,
with
a
son
to
subsist
as
well
as
himself
out
of
his
*NL*
pay
,
--
that
thou
didst
not
make
an
offer
to
him
of
my
purse
;
because
,
had
*NL*
he
stood
in
need
,
thou
knowest
,
Trim
,
he
had
been
as
welcome
to
it
as
*NL*
myself
.

Your

knows

said
the
corporal
,
I
had
no
orders
;

True
,
*NL*
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
thou
didst
very
right
,
Trim
,
as
a
soldier
,
--
but
*NL*
certainly
very
wrong
as
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
place
,
for
which
,
indeed
,
thou
hast
the
same
excuse
,
*NL*
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
when
thou
offeredst
him
whatever
was
in
my
*NL*
house
,

thou
shouldst
have
offered
him
my
house
too
:
--
A
sick
brother
*NL*
officer
should
have
the
best
quarters
,
Trim
,
and
if
we
had
him
with
*NL*
us
,

we
could
tend
and
look
to
him
:

Thou
art
an
excellent
nurse
*NL*
thyself
,
Trim

and
what
with
thy
care
of
him
,
and
the
old
woman
's
and
*NL*
his
boy
's
,
and
mine
together

we
might
recruit
him
again
at
once

*NL*
set
him
upon
his
legs

In

added
my

He

marching
the

He

said
my

A-well-o'day

The
Story
of
Le
Fever
Continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
looked
bright
the
morning
after
,
to
every
eye
in
the
village
but
*NL*
Le
Fever
's
and
his
afflicted
son
's
;
the
hand
of
death
pressed
heavy
upon
*NL*
his
eye-lids
,
--
and
hardly
could
the
wheel
at
the
cistern
turn
round
its
*NL*
circle
,
--
when
my
uncle
Toby
,
who
had
rose
up
an
hour
before
his
wonted
*NL*
time
,
entered
the
lieutenant
's
room
,
and
without
preface
or
apology
,
sat
*NL*
himself
down
upon
the
chair
by
the
bed-side
,
and
,
independently
of
all
*NL*
modes
and
customs
,
opened
the
curtain
in
the
manner
an
old
friend
and
*NL*
brother
officer
would
have
done
it
,
and
asked
him
how
he
did
,
--
how
*NL*
he
had
rested
in
the
night
,
--
what
was
his
complaint
,
--
where
was
his
*NL*
pain
,
--
and
what
he
could
do
to
help
him
:
--
and
without
giving
him
time
*NL*
to
answer
any
one
of
the
enquiries
,
went
on
,
and
told
him
of
the
little
*NL*
plan
which
he
had
been
concerting
with
the
corporal
the
night
before
for
*NL*
him
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
shall
go
home
directly
,
Le
Fever
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
my
*NL*
house
,
--
and
we
'll
send
for
a
doctor
to
see
what
's
the
matter
,
--
and
we
'll
*NL*
have
an
apothecary
,
--
and
the
corporal
shall
be
your
nurse
;
--
and
I
'll
be
*NL*
your
servant
,
Le
Fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
frankness
in
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
not
the
effect
of
*NL*
familiarity
,
--
but
the
cause
of
it
,
--
which
let
you
at
once
into
his
soul
,
*NL*
and
shewed
you
the
goodness
of
his
nature
;
to
this
there
was
something
*NL*
in
his
looks
,
and
voice
,
and
manner
,
superadded
,
which
eternally
*NL*
beckoned
to
the
unfortunate
to
come
and
take
shelter
under
him
,
so
that
*NL*
before
my
uncle
Toby
had
half
finished
the
kind
offers
he
was
making
to
*NL*
the
father
,
had
the
son
insensibly
pressed
up
close
to
his
knees
,
and
*NL*
had
taken
hold
of
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
and
was
pulling
it
towards
*NL*
him
.
--
The
blood
and
spirits
of
Le
Fever
,
which
were
waxing
cold
and
*NL*
slow
within
him
,
and
were
retreating
to
their
last
citadel
,
the
*NL*
heart
--
rallied
back
,
--
the
film
forsook
his
eyes
for
a
moment
,
--
he
*NL*
looked
up
wishfully
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
face
,
--
then
cast
a
look
upon
his
*NL*
boy
,
--
and
that
ligament
,
fine
as
it
was
,
--
was
never
broken
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Nature
instantly
ebb
'd
again
,
--
the
film
returned
to
its
*NL*
place
,
--
the
pulse
fluttered
--
stopp
'd
--
went
on
--
throbb
'd
--
stopp
'd
*NL*
again
--
moved
--
stopp
'd
--
shall
I
go
on
?
--
No

*NL*
I
am
so
impatient
to
return
to
my
own
story
,
that
what
remains
of
young
*NL*
Le
Fever
's
,
that
is
,
from
this
turn
of
his
fortune
,
to
the
time
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
recommended
him
for
my
preceptor
,
shall
be
told
in
a
very
few
words
*NL*
in
the
next
chapter
.
--
All
that
is
necessary
to
be
added
to
this
chapter
*NL*
is
as
follows
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
That
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
young
Le
Fever
in
his
hand
,
attended
the
poor
*NL*
lieutenant
,
as
chief
mourners
,
to
his
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
governor
of
Dendermond
paid
his
obsequies
all
military
*NL*
honours
,
--
and
that
Yorick
,
not
to
be
behind-hand
--
paid
him
all
*NL*
ecclesiastic
--
for
he
buried
him
in
his
chancel
:
--
And
it
appears
*NL*
likewise
,
he
preached
a
funeral
sermon
over
him
--
I
say
it
appears
,
--
for
*NL*
it
was
Yorick
's
custom
,
which
I
suppose
a
general
one
with
those
of
*NL*
his
profession
,
on
the
first
leaf
of
every
sermon
which
he
composed
,
*NL*
to
chronicle
down
the
time
,
the
place
,
and
the
occasion
of
its
being
*NL*
preached
:
to
this
,
he
was
ever
wont
to
add
some
short
comment
*NL*
or
stricture
upon
the
sermon
itself
,
seldom
,
indeed
,
much
to
its
*NL*
credit
:
--
For
instance
,
This
sermon
upon
the
Jewish
dispensation
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
it
at
all
;
--
Though
I
own
there
is
a
world
of
Water-Landish
*NL*
knowledge
in
it
;
--
but
't
is
all
tritical
,
and
most
tritically
put
*NL*
together
.
--
This
is
but
a
flimsy
kind
of
a
composition
;
what
was
in
my
*NL*
head
when
I
made
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
N.B.
.
The
excellency
of
this
text
is
,
that
it
will
suit
any
*NL*
sermon
,
--
and
of
this
sermon
,
--
that
it
will
suit
any
text
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
this
sermon
I
shall
be
hanged
,
--
for
I
have
stolen
the
greatest
*NL*
part
of
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
On
the
back
of
half
a
dozen
I
find
written
,
So
,
so
,
and
no
more
--
and
*NL*
upon
a
couple
Moderato
;
by
which
,
as
far
as
one
may
gather
from
*NL*
Altieri
's
Italian
dictionary
,
--
but
mostly
from
the
authority
of
a
piece
*NL*
of
green
whipcord
,
which
seemed
to
have
been
the
unravelling
of
Yorick
's
*NL*
whip-lash
,
with
which
he
has
left
us
the
two
sermons
marked
Moderato
,
*NL*
and
the
half
dozen
of
So
,
so
,
tied
fast
together
in
one
bundle
by
*NL*
themselves
,
--
one
may
safely
suppose
he
meant
pretty
near
the
same
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
but
one
difficulty
in
the
way
of
this
conjecture
,
which
is
*NL*
this
,
that
the
moderato
's
are
five
times
better
than
the
so
,
so
's
;
--
show
*NL*
ten
times
more
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
;
--
have
seventy
times
*NL*
more
wit
and
spirit
in
them
;
--
-LRB-
and
,
to
rise
properly
in
my
*NL*
climax
-RRB-
--
discovered
a
thousand
times
more
genius
;
--
and
to
crown
all
,
are
*NL*
infinitely
more
entertaining
than
those
tied
up
with
them
:
--
for
which
*NL*
reason
,
whene'er
Yorick
's
dramatic
sermons
are
offered
to
the
world
,
*NL*
though
I
shall
admit
but
one
out
of
the
whole
number
of
the
so
,
so
's
,
I
*NL*
shall
,
nevertheless
,
adventure
to
print
the
two
moderato
's
without
any
*NL*
sort
of
scruple
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Yorick
could
mean
by
the
words
lentamente
,
--
tenute
,
--
grave
,
--
and
*NL*
sometimes
adagio
,
--
as
applied
to
theological
compositions
,
and
with
*NL*
which
he
has
characterised
some
of
these
sermons
,
I
dare
not
venture
*NL*
to
guess
.
--
I
am
more
puzzled
still
upon
finding
a
l'octava
alta
!
*NL*
upon
one
;
--
Con
strepito
upon
the
back
of
another
;
--
Scicilliana
upon
a
*NL*
third
;
--
Alla
capella
upon
a
fourth
;
--
Con
l'arco
upon
this
;
--
Senza
l'arco
*NL*
upon
that
.
--
All
I
know
is
,
that
they
are
musical
terms
,
and
have
a
*NL*
meaning
;
--
and
as
he
was
a
musical
man
,
I
will
make
no
doubt
,
but
that
by
*NL*
some
quaint
application
of
such
metaphors
to
the
compositions
in
hand
,
*NL*
they
impressed
very
distinct
ideas
of
their
several
characters
upon
his
*NL*
fancy
,
--
whatever
they
may
do
upon
that
of
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amongst
these
,
there
is
that
particular
sermon
which
has
unaccountably
*NL*
led
me
into
this
digression
--
The
funeral
sermon
upon
poor
Le
Fever
,
*NL*
wrote
out
very
fairly
,
as
if
from
a
hasty
copy
.
--
I
take
notice
of
it
*NL*
the
more
,
because
it
seems
to
have
been
his
favourite
composition
--
It
*NL*
is
upon
mortality
;
and
is
tied
length-ways
and
cross-ways
with
a
yarn
*NL*
thrum
,
and
then
rolled
up
and
twisted
round
with
a
half-sheet
of
dirty
*NL*
blue
paper
,
which
seems
to
have
been
once
the
cast
cover
of
a
general
*NL*
review
,
which
to
this
day
smells
horribly
of
horse
drugs
.
--
Whether
these
*NL*
marks
of
humiliation
were
designed
,
--
I
something
doubt
;
--
because
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
sermon
-LRB-
and
not
at
the
beginning
of
it
-RRB-
--
very
different
from
*NL*
his
way
of
treating
the
rest
,
he
had
wrote
--
Bravo
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
Though
not
very
offensively
,
--
for
it
is
at
two
inches
,
at
least
,
and
*NL*
a
half
's
distance
from
,
and
below
the
concluding
line
of
the
sermon
,
*NL*
at
the
very
extremity
of
the
page
,
and
in
that
right
hand
corner
of
it
,
*NL*
which
,
you
know
,
is
generally
covered
with
your
thumb
;
and
,
to
do
it
*NL*
justice
,
it
is
wrote
besides
with
a
crow
's
quill
so
faintly
in
a
small
*NL*
Italian
hand
,
as
scarce
to
solicit
the
eye
towards
the
place
,
whether
*NL*
your
thumb
is
there
or
not
,
--
so
that
from
the
manner
of
it
,
it
stands
*NL*
half
excused
;
and
being
wrote
moreover
with
very
pale
ink
,
diluted
*NL*
almost
to
nothing
,
--
't
is
more
like
a
ritratto
of
the
shadow
of
vanity
,
*NL*
than
of
Vanity
herself
--
of
the
two
;
resembling
rather
a
faint
thought
of
*NL*
transient
applause
,
secretly
stirring
up
in
the
heart
of
the
composer
;
*NL*
than
a
gross
mark
of
it
,
coarsely
obtruded
upon
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
all
these
extenuations
,
I
am
aware
,
that
in
publishing
this
,
I
*NL*
do
no
service
to
Yorick
's
character
as
a
modest
man
;
--
but
all
men
have
*NL*
their
failings
!
and
what
lessens
this
still
farther
,
and
almost
wipes
it
*NL*
away
,
is
this
;
that
the
word
was
struck
through
sometime
afterwards
-LRB-
as
*NL*
appears
from
a
different
tint
of
the
ink
-RRB-
with
a
line
quite
across
it
in
*NL*
this
manner
,
BRAVO
-LRB-
crossed
out
-RRB-
--
as
if
he
had
retracted
,
or
was
ashamed
*NL*
of
the
opinion
he
had
once
entertained
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
short
characters
of
his
sermons
were
always
written
,
excepting
in
*NL*
this
one
instance
,
upon
the
first
leaf
of
his
sermon
,
which
served
as
a
*NL*
cover
to
it
;
and
usually
upon
the
inside
of
it
,
which
was
turned
towards
*NL*
the
text
;
--
but
at
the
end
of
his
discourse
,
where
,
perhaps
,
he
had
five
*NL*
or
six
pages
,
and
sometimes
,
perhaps
,
a
whole
score
to
turn
himself
*NL*
in
,
--
he
took
a
large
circuit
,
and
,
indeed
,
a
much
more
mettlesome
*NL*
one
;
--
as
if
he
had
snatched
the
occasion
of
unlacing
himself
with
a
*NL*
few
more
frolicksome
strokes
at
vice
,
than
the
straitness
of
the
pulpit
*NL*
allowed
.
--
These
,
though
hussar-like
,
they
skirmish
lightly
and
out
of
*NL*
all
order
,
are
still
auxiliaries
on
the
side
of
virtue
;
--
tell
me
then
,
*NL*
Mynheer
Vander
Blonederdondergewdenstronke
,
why
they
should
not
be
*NL*
printed
together
?

Chapter

LV
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
uncle
Toby
had
turned
every
thing
into
money
,
and
settled
all
*NL*
accounts
betwixt
the
agent
of
the
regiment
and
Le
Fever
,
and
betwixt
Le
*NL*
Fever
and
all
mankind
,
--
there
remained
nothing
more
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
hands
,
than
an
old
regimental
coat
and
a
sword
;
so
that
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
found
little
or
no
opposition
from
the
world
in
taking
administration
.
*NL*
The
coat
my
uncle
Toby
gave
the
corporal
;
--
Wear
it
,
Trim
,
said
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
as
long
as
it
will
hold
together
,
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
*NL*
lieutenant
--
And
this
,
--
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
taking
up
the
sword
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
drawing
it
out
of
the
scabbard
as
he
spoke
--
and
this
,
Le
*NL*
Fever
,
I
'll
save
for
thee
,
--
't
is
all
the
fortune
,
continued
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
,
hanging
it
up
upon
a
crook
,
and
pointing
to
it
,
--
't
is
all
the
*NL*
fortune
,
my
dear
Le
Fever
,
which
God
has
left
thee
;
but
if
he
has
given
*NL*
thee
a
heart
to
fight
thy
way
with
it
in
the
world
,
--
and
thou
doest
it
*NL*
like
a
man
of
honour
,
--
't
is
enough
for
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
my
uncle
Toby
had
laid
a
foundation
,
and
taught
him
to
*NL*
inscribe
a
regular
polygon
in
a
circle
,
he
sent
him
to
a
public
school
,
*NL*
where
,
excepting
Whitsontide
and
Christmas
,
at
which
times
the
corporal
*NL*
was
punctually
dispatched
for
him
,
--
he
remained
to
the
spring
of
the
*NL*
year
,
seventeen
;
when
the
stories
of
the
emperor
's
sending
his
army
into
*NL*
Hungary
against
the
Turks
,
kindling
a
spark
of
fire
in
his
bosom
,
he
*NL*
left
his
Greek
and
Latin
without
leave
,
and
throwing
himself
upon
his
*NL*
knees
before
my
uncle
Toby
,
begged
his
father
's
sword
,
and
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
leave
along
with
it
,
to
go
and
try
his
fortune
under
*NL*
Eugene
.
--
Twice
did
my
uncle
Toby
forget
his
wound
and
cry
out
,
Le
Fever
!
*NL*
I
will
go
with
thee
,
and
thou
shalt
fight
beside
me
--
And
twice
he
*NL*
laid
his
hand
upon
his
groin
,
and
hung
down
his
head
in
sorrow
and
*NL*
disconsolation
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
took
down
the
sword
from
the
crook
,
where
it
had
hung
*NL*
untouched
ever
since
the
lieutenant
's
death
,
and
delivered
it
to
*NL*
the
corporal
to
brighten
up
;
--
and
having
detained
Le
Fever

he
*NL*
put
the

into

If

Le

said
my

this
will
not

added
my

embracing

him
,
come

and
we
will
shape

another

The
greatest
injury
could
not
have
oppressed
the
heart
of
Le
Fever
more
*NL*
than
my
uncle
Toby
's
paternal
kindness
;
--
he
parted
from
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
as
the
best
of
sons
from
the
best
of
fathers
--
both
dropped
tears
--
and
as
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
gave
him
his
last
kiss
,
he
slipped
sixty
guineas
,
tied
up
*NL*
in
an
old
purse
of
his

in

was
his

Le
Fever
got
up
to
the
Imperial
army
just
time
enough
to
try
what
metal
*NL*
his
sword
was
made
of
,
at
the
defeat
of
the
Turks
before
Belgrade
;
but
*NL*
a
series
of
unmerited
mischances
had
pursued
him
from
that
moment
,
*NL*
and
trod
close
upon
his
heels
for
four
years
together
after
;
he
had
*NL*
withstood
these
buffetings
to
the
last
,
till
sickness
overtook
him
at
*NL*
Marseilles
,
from
whence
he
wrote
my
uncle
Toby
word
,
he
had
lost
his
*NL*
time
,
his
services
,
his
health
,
and
,
in
short
,
every
thing
but
his
*NL*
sword
;

was
waiting

to
return
back

As
this
letter
came
to
hand
about
six
weeks
before
Susannah

accident
,
*NL*
Le
Fever
was
hourly
expected
;
and
was
uppermost
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
*NL*
all
the
time
my
father
was
giving
him
and
Yorick
a
description
of
what
*NL*
kind
of
a
person
he
would
chuse
for
a
preceptor
to
me
:
but
as
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
thought
my
father
at
first
somewhat
fanciful
in
the
accomplishments
*NL*
he
required
,
he
forbore
mentioning
Le
Fever
's
name
,
--
till
the
character
,
*NL*
by
Yorick
's
inter-position
,
ending
unexpectedly
,
in
one
,
who
should
be
*NL*
gentle-tempered
,
and
generous
,
and
good
,
it
impressed
the
image
of
*NL*
Le
Fever
,
and
his
interest
,
upon
my
uncle
Toby
so
forcibly
,
he
rose
*NL*
instantly
off
his
chair
;
and
laying
down
his

in

to

my

every

yet
to

was
to

in

to
make

was
to

of

,
though
they
*NL*
have
carried
all
the
appearance
in

of
being
taken

entered
upon
in

hasty

hare-brained

unadvised
manner

and
could
you

have
got
into

we
should
have
found

weighed

poized

perpended

canvassed

entered

Of
the
number
of
these
was
my

resolution

putting
me
into

breeches

,
though
determined
at

in
a
kind

huff

and
a
*NL*
defiance
of
all
mankind
,
had
,
nevertheless

been
pro

conn

*NL*
judicially
talked
over

my

about
a

*NL*
in
two
several
beds
of
justice
,
which
my

had
held
for
that

purpose

step

behind

only
to
hear
in
what
kind

manner
my
*NL*
father
and
my
mother
debated
between
themselves
,
this
affair
of
the
*NL*
breeches
,

from
which
you
may
form
an
idea
,
how
they
debated
all
lesser
*NL*
matters

*NL*
The
ancient
Goths
of
Germany
,
who
-LRB-
the
learned
Cluverius
is
positive
-RRB-
*NL*
were
first
seated
in
the
country
between
the
Vistula
and
the
Oder
,
and
*NL*
who
afterwards
incorporated
the
Herculi
,
the
Bugians
,
and
some
other
*NL*
Vandallick
clans
to
'em
--
had
all
of
them
a
wise
custom
of
debating
every
*NL*
thing
of
importance
to
their
state
,
twice
,
that
is
,
--
once
drunk
,
and
*NL*
once
sober
:
--
Drunk
--
that
their
councils
might
not
want
vigour
;
--
and
*NL*
sober
--
that
they
might
not
want
discretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
my
father
being
entirely
a
water-drinker
,
--
was
a
long
time
gravelled
*NL*
almost
to
death
,
in
turning
this
as
much
to
his
advantage
,
as
he
did
*NL*
every
other
thing
which
the
ancients
did
or
said
;
and
it
was
not
till
*NL*
the
seventh
year
of
his
marriage
,
after
a
thousand
fruitless
experiments
*NL*
and
devices
,
that
he
hit
upon
an
expedient
which
answered
the
*NL*
purpose
;
--
and
that
was
,
when
any
difficult
and
momentous
point
was
to
be
*NL*
settled
in
the
family
,
which
required
great
sobriety
,
and
great
spirit
*NL*
too
,
in
its
determination
,
--
he
fixed
and
set
apart
the
first
Sunday
*NL*
night
in
the
month
,
and
the
Saturday
night
which
immediately
preceded
*NL*
it
,
to
argue
it
over
,
in
bed
with
my
mother
:
By
which
contrivance
,
if
*NL*
you
consider
,
Sir
,
with
yourself
,
.
.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
my
father
,
humorously
enough
,
called
his
beds
of
justice
;
--
for
*NL*
from
the
two
different
counsels
taken
in
these
two
different
humours
,
a
*NL*
middle
one
was
generally
found
out
which
touched
the
point
of
wisdom
as
*NL*
well
,
as
if
he
had
got
drunk
and
sober
a
hundred
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
not
be
made
a
secret
of
to
the
world
,
that
this
answers
full
as
*NL*
well
in
literary
discussions
,
as
either
in
military
or
conjugal
;
but
it
*NL*
is
not
every
author
that
can
try
the
experiment
as
the
Goths
and
Vandals
*NL*
did
it
--
or
,
if
he
can
,
may
it
be
always
for
his
body
's
health
;
and
to
do
*NL*
it
,
as
my
father
did
it
,
--
am
I
sure
it
would
be
always
for
his
soul
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
way
is
this
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
nice
and
ticklish
discussions
,
--
-LRB-
of
which
,
heaven
knows
,
there
*NL*
are
but
too
many
in
my
book
-RRB-
--
where
I
find
I
can
not
take
a
step
without
*NL*
the
danger
of
having
either
their
worships
or
their
reverences
upon
*NL*
my
back
--
I
write
one-half
full
,
--
and
t
`
other
fasting
;
--
or
write
it
all
*NL*
full
,
--
and
correct
it
fasting
;
--
or
write
it
fasting
,
--
and
correct
*NL*
it
full
,
for
they
all
come
to
the
same
thing
:
--
So
that
with
a
less
*NL*
variation
from
my
father
's
plan
,
than
my
father
's
from
the
Gothick
--
I
*NL*
feel
myself
upon
a
par
with
him
in
his
first
bed
of
justice
,
--
and
no
*NL*
way
inferior
to
him
in
his
second
.
--
These
different
and
almost
*NL*
irreconcileable
effects
,
flow
uniformly
from
the
wise
and
wonderful
*NL*
mechanism
of
nature
,
--
of
which
,
--
be
her
's
the
honour
.
--
All
that
we
*NL*
can
do
,
is
to
turn
and
work
the
machine
to
the
improvement
and
better
*NL*
manufactory
of
the
arts
and
sciences
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
when
I
write
full
,
--
I
write
as
if
I
was
never
to
write
fasting
*NL*
again
as
long
as
I
live
;
--
that
is
,
I
write
free
from
the
cares
as
well
*NL*
as
the
terrors
of
the
world
.
--
I
count
not
the
number
of
my
scars
,
--
nor
*NL*
does
my
fancy
go
forth
into
dark
entries
and
bye-corners
to
ante-date
my
*NL*
stabs
.
--
In
a
word
,
my
pen
takes
its
course
;
and
I
write
on
as
much
from
*NL*
the
fulness
of
my
heart
,
as
my
stomach
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
,
an
'
please
your
honours
,
I
indite
fasting
,
't
is
a
different
*NL*
history
.
--
I
pay
the
world
all
possible
attention
and
respect
,
--
and
have
*NL*
as
great
a
share
-LRB-
whilst
it
lasts
-RRB-
of
that
under
strapping
virtue
of
*NL*
discretion
as
the
best
of
you
.
--
So
that
betwixt
both
,
I
write
a
careless
*NL*
kind
of
a
civil
,
nonsensical
,
good-humoured
Shandean
book
,
which
will
do
*NL*
all
your
hearts
good
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
all
your
heads
too
,
--
provided
you
understand
it

turning
himself
half
round

shifting
his
pillow
a
little
towards
my
mother
's
,
as
he
opened

debate

begin

think

should
so

we
do

said

Not

looks

said

in

He
does
look
very
well

replied
my
mother

And
for
that
reason
it
would
be
almost
a
sin

added
my
father

to
take
*NL*
him
out
of
'em
.

*NL*
*NL*

It
would
so

said
my
mother

But
indeed
he
is
growing
a
very
tall

lad

rejoined
my
father

He
is

dialogue
ceased
for
a
moment
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
am
very
short
myself
,
--
continued
my
father
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
are
very
short
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
--
said
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Humph
!
quoth
my
father
to
himself
,
a
second
time
:
in
muttering
which
,
he
*NL*
plucked
his
pillow
a
little
further
from
my
mother
's
,
--
and
turning
about
*NL*
again
,
there
was
an
end
of
the
debate
for
three
minutes
and
a
half
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
When
he
gets
these
breeches
made
,
cried
my
father
in
a
higher
tone
,
*NL*
he
'll
look
like
a
beast
in
'em
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
will
be
very
awkward
in
them
at
first
,
replied
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
`
twill
be
lucky
,
if
that
's
the
worst
o
n't
,
added
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
very
lucky
,
answered
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
,
replied
my
father
,
--
making
some
pause
first
,
--
he
'll
be
*NL*
exactly
like
other
people
's
children
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Exactly
,
said
my
mother
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Though
I
shall
be
sorry
for
that
,
added
my
father
:
and
so
the
debate
*NL*
stopp
'd
again
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
should
be
of
leather
,
said
my
father
,
turning
him
about
again
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
They
will
last
him
,
said
my
mother
,
the
longest
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
can
have
no
linings
to
'em
,
replied
my
father
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
He
can
not
,
said
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Twere
better
to
have
them
of
fustian
,
quoth
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
can
be
better
,
quoth
my
mother
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Except
dimity
,
--
replied
my
father
:
--
'T
is
best
of
all
,
--
replied
my
*NL*
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
One
must
not
give
him
his
death
,
however
,
--
interrupted
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
no
means
,
said
my
mother
:
--
and
so
the
dialogue
stood
still
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
resolved
,
however
,
quoth
my
father
,
breaking
silence
the
fourth
*NL*
time
,
he
shall
have
no
pockets
in
them
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
is
no
occasion
for
any
,
said
my
mother
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
mean
in
his
coat
and
waistcoat
,
--
cried
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
mean
so
too
,
--
replied
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Though
if
he
gets
a
gig
or
top
--
Poor
souls
!
it
is
a
crown
and
a
*NL*
sceptre
to
them
,
--
they
should
have
where
to
secure
it
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Order
it
as
you
please
,
Mr.
Shandy
,
replied
my
mother
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
do
n't
you
think
it
right
?
added
my
father
,
pressing
the
point
home
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perfectly
,
said
my
mother
,
if
it
pleases
you
,
Mr.
Shandy
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
's
for
you
!
cried
my
father
,
losing
his
temper
--
Pleases
me
!
--
You
*NL*
never
will
distinguish
,
Mrs.
Shandy
,
nor
shall
I
ever
teach
you
to
do
*NL*
it
,
betwixt
a
point
of
pleasure
and
a
point
of
convenience
.

LXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
my
father
had
debated
the
affair
of
the
breeches
with
my
*NL*
mother
,
--
he
consulted
Albertus
Rubenius
upon
it
;
and
Albertus
Rubenius
*NL*
used
my
father
ten
times
worse
in
the
consultation
-LRB-
if
possible
-RRB-
than
*NL*
even
my
father
had
used
my
mother
:
For
as
Rubenius
had
wrote
a
quarto
*NL*
express
,
De
re
Vestiaria
Veterum
,
--
it
was
Rubenius
's
business
to
have
*NL*
given
my
father
some
lights
.
--
On
the
contrary
,
my
father
might
as
well
*NL*
have
thought
of
extracting
the
seven
cardinal
virtues
out
of
a
long
*NL*
beard
,
--
as
of
extracting
a
single
word
out
of
Rubenius
upon
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
every
other
article
of
ancient
dress
,
Rubenius
was
very
*NL*
communicative
to
my
father
;
--
gave
him
a
full
satisfactory
account
of
*NL*
*NL*
The
Toga
,
or
loose
gown
.
*NL*
The
Chlamys
.
*NL*
The
Ephod
.
*NL*
The
Tunica
,
or
Jacket
.
*NL*
The
Synthesis
.
*NL*
The
Paenula
.
*NL*
The
Lacema
,
with
its
Cucullus
.
*NL*
The
Paludamentum
.
*NL*
The
Praetexta
.
*NL*
The
Sagum
,
or
soldier
's
jerkin
.
*NL*
The
Trabea
:
of
which
,
according
to
Suetonius
,
there
was
three
kinds
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
what
are
all
these
to
the
breeches
?
said
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rubenius
threw
him
down
upon
the
counter
all
kinds
of
shoes
which
had
*NL*
been
in
fashion
with
the
Romans
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
*NL*
The
open
shoe
.
*NL*
The
close
shoe
.
*NL*
The
slip
shoe
.
*NL*
The
wooden
shoe
.
*NL*
The
soc
.
*NL*
The
buskin
.
*NL*
And
The
military
shoe
with
hobnails
in
it
,
which
Juvenal
takes
*NL*
notice
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
,
*NL*
The
clogs
.
*NL*
The
pattins
.
*NL*
The
pantoufles
.
*NL*
The
brogues
.
*NL*
The
sandals
,
with
latchets
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
*NL*
The
felt
shoe
.
*NL*
The
linen
shoe
.
*NL*
The
laced
shoe
.
*NL*
The
braided
shoe
.
*NL*
The
calceus
incisus
.
*NL*
And
The
calceus
rostratus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rubenius
shewed
my
father
how
well
they
all
fitted
,
--
in
what
manner
they
*NL*
laced
on
,
--
with
what
points
,
straps
,
thongs
,
latchets
,
ribbands
,
jaggs
,
*NL*
and
ends
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
I
want
to
be
informed
about
the
breeches
,
said
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Albertus
Rubenius
informed
my
father
that
the
Romans
manufactured
*NL*
stuffs
of
various
fabrics
,
--
some
plain
,
--
some
striped
,
--
others
diapered
*NL*
throughout
the
whole
contexture
of
the
wool
,
with
silk
and
gold
--
That
*NL*
linen
did
not
begin
to
be
in
common
use
till
towards
the
declension
of
*NL*
the
empire
,
when
the
Egyptians
coming
to
settle
amongst
them
,
brought
it
*NL*
into
vogue
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
persons
of
quality
and
fortune
distinguished
themselves
by
the
*NL*
fineness
and
whiteness
of
their
clothes
;
which
colour
-LRB-
next
to
purple
,
*NL*
which
was
appropriated
to
the
great
offices
-RRB-
they
most
affected
,
and
*NL*
wore
on
their
birth-days
and
public
rejoicings
.
--
That
it
appeared
from
*NL*
the
best
historians
of
those
times
,
that
they
frequently
sent
their
*NL*
clothes
to
the
fuller
,
to
be
clean
'd
and
whitened
:
--
but
that
the
*NL*
inferior
people
,
to
avoid
that
expence
,
generally
wore
brown
clothes
,
*NL*
and
of
a
something
coarser
texture
,
--
till
towards
the
beginning
of
*NL*
Augustus
's
reign
,
when
the
slave
dressed
like
his
master
,
and
almost
*NL*
every
distinction
of
habiliment
was
lost
,
but
the
Latus
Clavus
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
what
was
the
Latus
Clavus
?
said
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rubenius
told
him
,
that
the
point
was
still
litigating
amongst
the
*NL*
learned
:
--
That
Egnatius
,
Sigonius
,
Bossius
Ticinensis
,
Bayfius
Budaeus
,
*NL*
Salmasius
,
Lipsius
,
Lazius
,
Isaac
Casaubon
,
and
Joseph
Scaliger
,
all
*NL*
differed
from
each
other
,
--
and
he
from
them
:
That
some
took
it
to
be
the
*NL*
button
,
--
some
the
coat
itself
,
--
others
only
the
colour
of
it
;
--
That
the
*NL*
great
Bayfuis
in
his
Wardrobe
of
the
Ancients
,
chap
.
12
--
honestly
said
,
*NL*
he
knew
not
what
it
was
,
--
whether
a
tibula
,
--
a
stud
,
--
a
button
,
--
a
*NL*
loop
,
--
a
buckle
,
--
or
clasps
and
keepers
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
father
lost
the
horse
,
but
not
the
saddle
--
They
are
hooks
and
eyes
,
*NL*
said
my
father
--
and
with
hooks
and
eyes
he
ordered
my
breeches
to
be
*NL*
made
.

We

of

*NL*
*NL*

Leave
we
then
the
breeches
in
the
taylor
's
hands
,
with
my
father
*NL*
standing
over
him
with
his
cane
,
reading
him
as
he
sat
at
work
a
*NL*
lecture
upon
the
latus
clavus
,
and
pointing
to
the
precise
part
of
the
*NL*
waistband
,
where
he
was
determined
to
have
it
sewed
on

Leave

my

-LRB-
truest
of

the
Poco-curante
's
of
her
*NL*
sex
!
-RRB-
--
careless
about
it
,
as
about
every
thing
else
in
the
world
which
*NL*
concerned
her
;

that
is

indifferent
whether

If
the
reader
has
not
a
clear
conception
of
the
rood
and
the
half
of
*NL*
ground
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
kitchen-garden
,
and
*NL*
which
was
the
scene
of
so
many
of
his
delicious
hours
,
--
the
fault
is
not
*NL*
in
me
,
--
but
in
his
imagination
;
--
for
I
am
sure
I
gave
him
so
minute
a
*NL*
description
,
I
was
almost
ashamed
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Fate
was
looking
forwards
one
afternoon
,
into
the
great
*NL*
transactions
of
future
times
,
--
and
recollected
for
what
purposes
*NL*
this
little
plot
,
by
a
decree
fast
bound
down
in
iron
,
had
been
*NL*
destined
,
--
she
gave
a
nod
to
Nature
,
--
't
was
enough
--
Nature
threw
half
a
*NL*
spade
full
of
her
kindliest
compost
upon
it
,
with
just
so
much
clay
in
*NL*
it
,
as
to
retain
the
forms
of
angles
and
indentings
,
--
and
so
little
of
*NL*
it
too
,
as
not
to
cling
to
the
spade
,
and
render
works
of
so
much
glory
,
*NL*
nasty
in
foul
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
came
down
,
as
the
reader
has
been
informed
,
with
plans
*NL*
along
with
him
,
of
almost
every
fortified
town
in
Italy
and
Flanders
;
*NL*
so
let
the
duke
of
Marlborough
,
or
the
allies
,
have
set
down
before
what
*NL*
town
they
pleased
,
my
uncle
Toby
was
prepared
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
way
,
which
was
the
simplest
one
in
the
world
,
was
this
;
as
soon
as
*NL*
ever
a
town
was
invested
--
-LRB-
but
sooner
when
the
design
was
known
-RRB-
to
take
*NL*
the
plan
of
it
-LRB-
let
it
be
what
town
it
would
-RRB-
,
and
enlarge
it
upon
a
*NL*
scale
to
the
exact
size
of
his
bowling-green
;
upon
the
surface
of
which
,
*NL*
by
means
of
a
large
role
of
packthread
,
and
a
number
of
small
piquets
*NL*
driven
into
the
ground
,
at
the
several
angles
and
redans
,
he
transferred
*NL*
the
lines
from
his
paper
;
then
taking
the
profile
of
the
place
,
with
its
*NL*
works
,
to
determine
the
depths
and
slopes
of
the
ditches
,
--
the
talus
of
*NL*
the
glacis
,
and
the
precise
height
of
the
several
banquets
,
parapets
,
*NL*
&
c.
--
he
set
the
corporal
to
work
--
and
sweetly
went
it
on
:
--
The
nature
*NL*
of
the
soil
,
--
the
nature
of
the
work
itself
,
--
and
above
all
,
the
*NL*
good-nature
of
my
uncle
Toby
sitting
by
from
morning
to
night
,
and
*NL*
chatting
kindly
with
the
corporal
upon
past-done
deeds
,
--
left
Labour
*NL*
little
else
but
the
ceremony
of
the
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
place
was
finished
in
this
manner
,
and
put
into
a
proper
*NL*
posture
of
defence
,
--
it
was
invested
,
--
and
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
*NL*
corporal
began
to
run
their
first
parallel
.
--
I
beg
I
may
not
be
*NL*
interrupted
in
my
story
,
by
being
told
,
That
the
first
parallel
should
*NL*
be
at
least
three
hundred
toises
distant
from
the
main
body
of
the
*NL*
place
,
--
and
that
I
have
not
left
a
single
inch
for
it
;
--
for
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
took
the
liberty
of
incroaching
upon
his
kitchen-garden
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
enlarging
his
works
on
the
bowling-green
,
and
for
that
reason
*NL*
generally
ran
his
first
and
second
parallels
betwixt
two
rows
of
his
*NL*
cabbages
and
his
cauliflowers
;
the
conveniences
and
inconveniences
of
*NL*
which
will
be
considered
at
large
in
the
history
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
and
the
corporal
's
campaigns
,
of
which
,
this
I
'm
now
writing
is
but
a
*NL*
sketch
,
and
will
be
finished
,
if
I
conjecture
right
,
in
three
pages
-LRB-
but
*NL*
there
is
no
guessing
-RRB-
--
The
campaigns
themselves
will
take
up
as
many
*NL*
books
;
and
therefore
I
apprehend
it
would
be
hanging
too
great
a
weight
*NL*
of
one
kind
of
matter
in
so
flimsy
a
performance
as
this
,
to
rhapsodize
*NL*
them
,
as
I
once
intended
,
into
the
body
of
the
work
--
surely
they
*NL*
had
better
be
printed
apart
,
--
we
'll
consider
the
affair
--
so
take
the
*NL*
following
sketch
of
them
in
the
mean

When
the
town
,
with
its
works
,
was
finished
,
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
*NL*
corporal
began
to
run
their
first
parallel
--
not
at
random
,
or
any
*NL*
how
--
but
from
the
same
points
and
distances
the
allies
had
begun
to
run
*NL*
theirs
;
and
regulating
their
approaches
and
attacks
,
by
the
accounts
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
received
from
the
daily
papers
,
--
they
went
on
,
during
the
*NL*
whole
siege
,
step
by
step
with
the
allies
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
duke
of
Marlborough
made
a
lodgment
,
--
my
uncle
Toby
made
a
*NL*
lodgment
too
.
--
And
when
the
face
of
a
bastion
was
battered
down
,
or
a
*NL*
defence
ruined
,
--
the
corporal
took
his
mattock
and
did
as
much
,
--
and
*NL*
so
on
;
--
gaining
ground
,
and
making
themselves
masters
of
the
works
one
*NL*
after
another
,
till
the
town
fell
into
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
one
who
took
pleasure
in
the
happy
state
of
others
,
--
there
could
not
*NL*
have
been
a
greater
sight
in
world
,
than
on
a
post
morning
,
in
which
a
*NL*
practicable
breach
had
been
made
by
the
duke
of
Marlborough
,
in
the
*NL*
main
body
of
the
place
,
--
to
have
stood
behind
the
horn-beam
hedge
,
and
*NL*
observed
the
spirit
with
which
my
uncle
Toby
,
with
Trim
behind
him
,
*NL*
sallied
forth
;
--
the
one
with
the
Gazette
in
his
hand
,
--
the
other
with
a
*NL*
spade
on
his
shoulder
to
execute
the
contents
.
--
What
an
honest
triumph
*NL*
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
looks
as
he
marched
up
to
the
ramparts
!
What
intense
*NL*
pleasure
swimming
in
his
eye
as
he
stood
over
the
corporal
,
reading
the
*NL*
paragraph
ten
times
over
to
him
,
as
he
was
at
work
,
lest
,
peradventure
,
*NL*
he
should
make
the
breach
an
inch
too
wide
,
--
or
leave
it
an
inch
too
*NL*
narrow
.
--
But
when
the
chamade
was
beat
,
and
the
corporal
helped
my
uncle
*NL*
up
it
,
and
followed
with
the
colours
in
his
hand
,
to
fix
them
upon
the
*NL*
ramparts
--
Heaven
!
Earth
!
Sea
!
--
but
what
avails
apostrophes
?
--
with
*NL*
all
your
elements
,
wet
or
dry
,
ye
never
compounded
so
intoxicating
a
*NL*
draught
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
track
of
happiness
for
many
years
,
without
one
interruption
to
*NL*
it
,
except
now
and
then
when
the
wind
continued
to
blow
due
west
for
a
*NL*
week
or
ten
days
together
,
which
detained
the
Flanders
mail
,
and
kept
*NL*
them
so
long
in
torture
,
--
but
still
't
was
the
torture
of
the
happy
--
In
*NL*
this
track
,
I
say
,
did
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
move
for
many
years
,
every
*NL*
year
of
which
,
and
sometimes
every
month
,
from
the
invention
of
either
*NL*
the
one
or
the
other
of
them
,
adding
some
new
conceit
or
quirk
of
*NL*
improvement
to
their
operations
,
which
always
opened
fresh
springs
of
*NL*
delight
in
carrying
them
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
year
's
campaign
was
carried
on
from
beginning
to
end
,
in
the
*NL*
plain
and
simple
method
I
've
related
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
year
,
in
which
my
uncle
Toby
took
Liege
and
Ruremond
,
he
*NL*
thought
he
might
afford
the
expence
of
four
handsome
draw-bridges
;
of
*NL*
two
of
which
I
have
given
an
exact
description
in
the
former
part
of
my
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
latter
end
of
the
same
year
he
added
a
couple
of
gates
with
*NL*
port-cullises
:
--
These
last
were
converted
afterwards
into
orgues
,
as
*NL*
the
better
thing
;
and
during
the
winter
of
the
same
year
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
instead
of
a
new
suit
of
clothes
,
which
he
always
had
at
Christmas
,
*NL*
treated
himself
with
a
handsome
sentry-box
,
to
stand
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
the
bowling-green
,
betwixt
which
point
and
the
foot
of
the
glacis
,
*NL*
there
was
left
a
little
kind
of
an
esplanade
for
him
and
the
corporal
to
*NL*
confer
and
hold
councils
of
war
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
sentry-box
was
in
case
of
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
were
painted
white
three
times
over
the
ensuing
spring
,
which
*NL*
enabled
my
uncle
Toby
to
take
the
field
with
great
splendour
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
would
often
say
to
Yorick
,
that
if
any
mortal
in
the
whole
*NL*
universe
had
done
such
a
thing
except
his
brother
Toby
,
it
would
have
*NL*
been
looked
upon
by
the
world
as
one
of
the
most
refined
satires
upon
*NL*
the
parade
and
prancing
manner
in
which
Lewis
XIV
.
from
the
beginning
of
*NL*
the
war
,
but
particularly
that
very
year
,
had
taken
the
field
--
But
't
is
*NL*
not
my
brother
Toby
's
nature
,
kind
soul
!
my
father
would
add
,
to
insult
*NL*
any
one
.
*NL*

But
let
us
go
on

Chapter

LXVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
must
observe
,
that
although
in
the
first
year
's
campaign
,
the
word
*NL*
town
is
often
mentioned
,
--
yet
there
was
no
town
at
that
time
within
the
*NL*
polygon
;
that
addition
was
not
made
till
the
summer
following
the
spring
*NL*
in
which
the
bridges
and
sentry-box
were
painted
,
which
was
the
third
*NL*
year
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaigns
,
--
when
upon
his
taking
Amberg
,
Bonn
,
*NL*
and
Rhinberg
,
and
Huy
and
Limbourg
,
one
after
another
,
a
thought
came
*NL*
into
the
corporal
's
head
,
that
to
talk
of
taking
so
many
towns
,
without
*NL*
one
Town
to
shew
for
it
,
--
was
a
very
nonsensical
way
of
going
to
work
,
*NL*
and
so
proposed
to
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
they
should
have
a
little
model
*NL*
of
a
town
built
for
them
,
--
to
be
run
up
together
of
slit
deals
,
and
then
*NL*
painted
,
and
clapped
within
the
interior
polygon
to
serve
for
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
felt
the
good
of
the
project
instantly
,
and
instantly
*NL*
agreed
to
it
,
but
with
the
addition
of
two
singular
improvements
,
of
*NL*
which
he
was
almost
as
proud
as
if
he
had
been
the
original
inventor
of
*NL*
the
project
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
was
,
to
have
the
town
built
exactly
in
the
style
of
those
of
*NL*
which
it
was
most
likely
to
be
the
representative
:
--
with
grated
windows
,
*NL*
and
the
gable
ends
of
the
houses
,
facing
the
streets
,
&
c.
&
c.
--
as
those
*NL*
in
Ghent
and
Bruges
,
and
the
rest
of
the
towns
in
Brabant
and
Flanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
was
,
not
to
have
the
houses
run
up
together
,
as
the
corporal
*NL*
proposed
,
but
to
have
every
house
independent
,
to
hook
on
,
or
off
,
so
*NL*
as
to
form
into
the
plan
of
whatever
town
they
pleased
.
This
was
put
*NL*
directly
into
hand
,
and
many
and
many
a
look
of
mutual
congratulation
*NL*
was
exchanged
between
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
,
as
the
carpenter
*NL*
did
the
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
answered
prodigiously
the
next
summer
--
the
town
was
a
perfect
*NL*
Proteus
--
It
was
Landen
,
and
Trerebach
,
and
Santvliet
,
and
Drusen
,
and
*NL*
Hagenau
,
--
and
then
it
was
Ostend
and
Menin
,
and
Aeth
and
Dendermond
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Surely
never
did
any
Town
act
so
many
parts
,
since
Sodom
and
Gomorrah
,
*NL*
as
my
uncle
Toby
's
town
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fourth
year
,
my
uncle
Toby
thinking
a
town
looked
foolishly
*NL*
without
a
church
,
added
a
very
fine
one
with
a
steeple
.
--
Trim
was
for
*NL*
having
bells
in
it
;
--
my
uncle
Toby
said
,
the
metal
had
better
be
cast
*NL*
into
cannon
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
led
the
way
the
next
campaign
for
half
a
dozen
brass
field-pieces
,
*NL*
to
be
planted
three
and
three
on
each
side
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
sentry-box
;
and
in
a
short
time
,
these
led
the
way
for
a
train
*NL*
of
somewhat
larger
,
--
and
so
on
--
-LRB-
as
must
always
be
the
case
in
*NL*
hobby-horsical
affairs
-RRB-
from
pieces
of
half
an
inch
bore
,
till
it
came
*NL*
at
last
to
my
father
's
jack
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
year
,
which
was
that
in
which
Lisle
was
besieged
,
and
at
the
*NL*
close
of
which
both
Ghent
and
Bruges
fell
into
our
hands
,
--
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
was
sadly
put
to
it
for
proper
ammunition
;
--
I
say
proper
*NL*
ammunition
--
because
his
great
artillery
would
not
bear
powder
;
and
't
was
*NL*
well
for
the
Shandy
family
they
would
not
--
For
so
full
were
the
papers
,
*NL*
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
siege
,
of
the
incessant
firings
*NL*
kept
up
by
the
besiegers
,
--
and
so
heated
was
my
uncle
Toby
's
imagination
*NL*
with
the
accounts
of
them
,
that
he
had
infallibly
shot
away
all
his
*NL*
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
therefore
was
wanting
as
a
succedaneum
,
especially
in
one
or
*NL*
two
of
the
more
violent
paroxysms
of
the
siege
,
to
keep
up
something
*NL*
like
a
continual
firing
in
the
imagination
,
--
and
this
something
,
the
*NL*
corporal
,
whose
principal
strength
lay
in
invention
,
supplied
by
an
*NL*
entire
new
system
of
battering
of
his
own
,
--
without
which
,
this
had
been
*NL*
objected
to
by
military
critics
,
to
the
end
of
the
world
,
as
one
of
the
*NL*
great
desiderata
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
apparatus
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
will
not
be
explained
the
worse
,
for
setting
off
,
as
I
generally
*NL*
do
,
at
a
little
distance
from
the
subject
.

*NL*
*NL*
With
two
or
three
other
trinkets
,
small
in
themselves
,
but
of
great
*NL*
regard
,
which
poor
Tom
,
the
corporal
's
unfortunate
brother
,
had
sent
him
*NL*
over
,
with
the
account
of
his
marriage
with
the
Jew
's
widow
--
there
was
*NL*
*NL*
A
Montero-cap
and
two
Turkish
tobacco-pipes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Montero-cap
I
shall
describe
by
and
bye
.
--
The
Turkish
tobacco-pipes
*NL*
had
nothing
particular
in
them
,
they
were
fitted
up
and
ornamented
as
*NL*
usual
,
with
flexible
tubes
of
Morocco
leather
and
gold
wire
,
and
mounted
*NL*
at
their
ends
,
the
one
of
them
with
ivory
,
--
the
other
with
black
ebony
,
*NL*
tipp
'd
with
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
who
saw
all
things
in
lights
different
from
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
world
,
would
say
to
the
corporal
,
that
he
ought
to
look
upon
these
*NL*
two
presents
more
as
tokens
of
his
brother
's
nicety
,
than
his
*NL*
affection
.
--
Tom
did
not
care
,
Trim
,
he
would
say
,
to
put
on
the
cap
,
*NL*
or
to
smoke
in
the
tobacco-pipe
of
a
Jew
.
--
God
bless
your
honour
,
the
*NL*
corporal
would
say
-LRB-
giving
a
strong
reason
to
the
contrary
-RRB-
--
how
can
*NL*
that
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
Montero-cap
was
scarlet
,
of
a
superfine
Spanish
cloth
,
dyed
in
*NL*
grain
,
and
mounted
all
round
with
fur
,
except
about
four
inches
in
the
*NL*
front
,
which
was
faced
with
a
light
blue
,
slightly
embroidered
,
--
and
*NL*
seemed
to
have
been
the
property
of
a
Portuguese
quarter-master
,
not
of
*NL*
foot
,
but
of
horse
,
as
the
word
denotes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
was
not
a
little
proud
of
it
,
as
well
for
its
own
sake
,
as
*NL*
the
sake
of
the
giver
,
so
seldom
or
never
put
it
on
but
upon
Gala-days
;
*NL*
and
yet
never
was
a
Montero-cap
put
to
so
many
uses
;
for
in
all
*NL*
controverted
points
,
whether
military
or
culinary
,
provided
the
corporal
*NL*
was
sure
he
was
in
the
right
,
--
it
was
either
his
oath
,
--
his
wager
,
--
or
*NL*
his
gift
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
was
his
gift
in
the
present
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
'll
be
bound
,
said
the
corporal
,
speaking
to
himself
,
to
give
away
*NL*
my
Montero-cap
to
the
first
beggar
who
comes
to
the
door
,
if
I
do
not
*NL*
manage
this
matter
to
his
honour
's
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
completion
was
no
further
off
,
than
the
very
next
morning
;
which
was
*NL*
that
of
the
storm
of
the
counterscarp
betwixt
the
Lower
Deule
,
to
the
*NL*
right
,
and
the
gate
St.
Andrew
,
--
and
on
the
left
,
between
St.
Magdalen
's
*NL*
and
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
was
the
most
memorable
attack
in
the
whole
war
,
--
the
most
*NL*
gallant
and
obstinate
on
both
sides
,
--
and
I
must
add
the
most
bloody
*NL*
too
,
for
it
cost
the
allies
themselves
that
morning
above
eleven
hundred
*NL*
men
,
--
my
uncle
Toby
prepared
himself
for
it
with
a
more
than
ordinary
*NL*
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eve
which
preceded
,
as
my
uncle
Toby
went
to
bed
,
he
ordered
his
*NL*
ramallie
wig
,
which
had
laid
inside
out
for
many
years
in
the
corner
of
*NL*
an
old
campaigning
trunk
,
which
stood
by
his
bedside
,
to
be
taken
out
*NL*
and
laid
upon
the
lid
of
it
,
ready
for
the
morning
;
--
and
the
very
first
*NL*
thing
he
did
in
his
shirt
,
when
he
had
stepped
out
of
bed
,
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
,
after
he
had
turned
the
rough
side
outwards
,
--
put
it
on
:
--
This
*NL*
done
,
he
proceeded
next
to
his
breeches
,
and
having
buttoned
the
*NL*
waist-band
,
he
forthwith
buckled
on
his
sword-belt
,
and
had
got
his
*NL*
sword
half
way
in
,
--
when
he
considered
he
should
want
shaving
,
and
that
*NL*
it
would

it
with

took
it
*NL*
off
:

In
essaying
to
put
on
his
regimental
coat
and
waistcoat
,
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
found
the
same
objection
in
his
wig

so
that
went
off
too
:

So
*NL*
that
what
with
one

what
with
another
,
as
always
falls
out
when
*NL*
a

is
in

most
haste

't
was
ten

My
uncle
Toby
had
scarce
turned
the
corner
of
his
yew
hedge
,
which
*NL*
separated
his
kitchen-garden
from
his
bowling-green
,
when
he
perceived
*NL*
the
corporal
had
begun
the
attack
without
him
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
Let
me
stop
and
give
you
a
picture
of
the
corporal
's
apparatus
;
and
of
*NL*
the
corporal
himself
in
the
height
of
his
attack
,
just
as
it
struck
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
as
he
turned
towards
the
sentry-box
,
where
the
corporal
*NL*
was
at
work
,
--
for
in
nature
there
is
not
such
another
,
--
nor
can
any
*NL*
combination
of
all
that
is
grotesque
and
whimsical
in
her
works
produce
*NL*
its
equal

The
corporal
--

Tread
lightly
on
his
ashes
,
ye
men
of
genius
,

for
he
was
your
*NL*
kinsman
:
*NL*
*NL*
Weed
his
grave
clean
,
ye
men
of
goodness
,

for
he
was
your

--
Oh
*NL*
corporal
!
had
I
thee
,
but
now
,
--
now
,
that
I
am
able
to
give
thee
a
*NL*
dinner
and
protection
,

how
would
I
cherish
thee
!
thou
should

wear
*NL*
thy
Montero-cap
every

of
the
day
,
and
every

of
the

and
*NL*
when
it
was
worn
out
,
I
would
purchase
thee
a
couple
like
it
:

But
alas

*NL*
alas
!
alas

now
that
I
can
do
this
in
spite
of
their
reverences
--
the
*NL*
occasion
is
lost
--
for
thou
art
gone
;
--
thy
genius
fled
up
to
the

*NL*
from
whence
it
came
;

and
that
warm
heart
of
thine
,
with
all
its

generous

compressed
into
a
clod
of

But
what

is
this
,
to
that
future

dreaded

where
I
look
*NL*
towards
the
velvet
pall

decorated
with
the
military
ensigns

thy

the
first

the
foremost
of

I

see
*NL*
thee

faithful

laying
his
sword
and
scabbard
with
a
trembling
*NL*
hand
across
his
coffin
,
and
then
returning
pale
as
ashes
to
the
door
,
*NL*
to
take
his
mourning
horse
by
the
bridle
,
to
follow
his
hearse
,

*NL*
directed
thee
;

all
my

's
systems
shall
be
baffled
by
his

sorrows
;

,
in

his

I
shall
behold
him
,
as
he
*NL*
inspects
the
lackered
plate

twice
taking
his
spectacles
from
off
his
*NL*
nose
,
to
wipe
away
the
dew
which
nature
has
shed
upon
them
--
When
I
see
*NL*
him
cast
in
the
rosemary
with
an
air
of
disconsolation
,
which
cries
*NL*
through
my
ears
,
--
O
Toby

in

I
seek
thy
*NL*
fellow

Gracious

plain

*NL*
The
corporal
,
who
the
night
before
had
resolved
in
his
mind
to
supply
*NL*
the
grand
desideratum
,
of
keeping
up
something
like
an
incessant
firing
*NL*
upon
the
enemy
during
the
heat
of
the
attack
,
--
had
no
further
idea
in
*NL*
his
fancy
at
that
time
,
than
a
contrivance
of
smoking
tobacco
against
*NL*
the
town
,
out
of
one
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
six
field-pieces
,
which
were
*NL*
planted
on
each
side
of
his
sentry-box
;
the
means
of
effecting
which
*NL*
occurring
to
his
fancy
at
the
same
time
,
though
he
had
pledged
his
cap
,
*NL*
he
thought
it
in
no
danger
from
the
miscarriage
of
his
projects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
turning
it
this
way
,
and
that
,
a
little
in
his
mind
,
he
soon
began
*NL*
to
find
out
,
that
by
means
of
his
two
Turkish
tobacco-pipes
,
with
the
*NL*
supplement
of
three
smaller
tubes
of
wash-leather
at
each
of
their
*NL*
lower
ends
,
to
be
tagg
'd
by
the
same
number
of
tin-pipes
fitted
to
*NL*
the
touch-holes
,
and
sealed
with
clay
next
the
cannon
,
and
then
tied
*NL*
hermetically
with
waxed
silk
at
their
several
insertions
into
the
*NL*
Morocco
tube
,
--
he
should
be
able
to
fire
the
six
field-pieces
all
*NL*
together
,
and
with
the
same
ease
as
to
fire
one
.
--
*NL*

Let
no
man
say
from
what
taggs
and
jaggs
hints
may
not
be
cut
out
for
*NL*
the
advancement
of
human
knowledge
.
Let
no
man
,
who
has
read
my
father
's
*NL*
first
and
second
beds
of
justice
,
ever
rise
up

say
again
,
from
*NL*
collision
of
what
kinds
of
bodies
light
may
or
may
not
be
struck
out
,
to
*NL*
carry
the
arts
and
sciences
up
to
perfection

Heaven

thou
knowest
how
*NL*
I
love
them
;

thou
knowest
the
secrets
of
my
heart
,
and

I
would
*NL*
this
moment
give
my
shirt

*NL*
No
matter

Eugenius
;
I
would
give
the
shirt
off
my
back
to
be
*NL*
burnt
into

,
were
it
only
to
satisfy
one
feverish
enquirer
,
how
*NL*
many
sparks
at
one
good
stroke
,
a
good
flint
and
steel
could
strike
*NL*
into
the
tail
of
it
.

Think
ye
not
that
in
striking
these
in
,

he
might
,
*NL*
per-adventure
,
strike
something
out
?
as
sure
as
a
gun

But
this
project
,
by

bye

*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
sat
up
the
best
part
of
the
night
,
in
bringing
his
to
*NL*
perfection
;
and
having
made
a
sufficient
proof
of
his
cannon
,
with
*NL*
charging
them
to
the
top
with
tobacco
,

he
went
with
contentment
to

The

had
slipped
out
about
ten
minutes
before
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
*NL*
order
to
fix
his
apparatus
,
and
just
give
the
enemy
a
shot
or
two
before
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
drawn
the
six
field-pieces
for
this
end
,
all
close
up
together
in
*NL*
front
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentry-box
,
leaving
only
an
interval
of
about
*NL*
a
yard
and
a
half
betwixt
the
three
,
on
the
right
and
left
,
for
the
*NL*
convenience
of
charging
,
&
c.
--
and
the
sake
possibly
of
two
batteries
,
*NL*
which
he
might
think
double
the
honour
of
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
rear
and
facing
this
opening
,
with
his
back
to
the
door
of
the
*NL*
sentry-box
,
for
fear
of
being
flanked
,
had
the
corporal
wisely
taken
his
*NL*
post
:
--
He
held
the
ivory
pipe
,
appertaining
to
the
battery
on
the
right
,
*NL*
betwixt
the
finger
and
thumb
of
his
right
hand
,

and
the
ebony
pipe
*NL*
tipp
'd
with
silver
,
which
appertained
to
the
battery
on
the
left
,
*NL*
betwixt
the
finger
and
thumb
of
the
other
--
and
with
his
right
knee
fixed
*NL*
firm
upon
the
ground
,
as
if
in
the
front
rank
of
his
platoon
,
was
the
*NL*
corporal
,
with
his
Montero-cap
upon
his
head
,
furiously
playing
off
his
*NL*
two
cross
batteries
at
the
same
time
against
the
counter-guard
,
which
*NL*
faced
the
counterscarp
,
where
the
attack
was
to
be
made
that
morning
.
*NL*
His
first
intention
,
as
I
said
,
was
no
more
than
giving
the
enemy
a
*NL*
single
puff
or
two
;
--
but
the
pleasure
of
the
puffs
,
as
well
as
the
*NL*
puffing
,
had
insensibly
got
hold
of
the
corporal
,
and
drawn
him
on
from
*NL*
puff
to
puff
,
into
the
very
height
of
the
attack
,
by
the
time
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
joined
him
.

'T

*NL*
*NL*
Amongst
the
many
ill
consequences
of
the
treaty
of
Utrecht
,
it
was
*NL*
within
a
point
of
giving
my
uncle
Toby
a
surfeit
of
sieges
;
and
though
*NL*
he
recovered
his
appetite
afterwards
,
yet
Calais
itself
left
not
a
*NL*
deeper
scar
in
Mary
's
heart
,
than
Utrecht
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
.
To
the
*NL*
end
of
his
life
he
never
could
hear
Utrecht
mentioned
upon
any
account
*NL*
whatever
,
--
or
so
much
as
read
an
article
of
news
extracted
out
of
the
*NL*
Utrecht
Gazette
,
without
fetching
a
sigh
,
as
if
his
heart
would
break
in
*NL*
twain
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
who
was
a
great
Motive-Monger
,
and
consequently
a
very
*NL*
dangerous
person
for
a
man
to
sit
by
,
either
laughing
or
crying
,
--
for
he
*NL*
generally
knew
your
motive
for
doing
both
,
much
better
than
you
knew
it
*NL*
yourself
--
would
always
console
my
uncle
Toby
upon
these
occasions
,
in
a
*NL*
way
,
which
shewed
plainly
,
he
imagined
my
uncle
Toby
grieved
for
nothing
*NL*
in
the
whole
affair
,
so
much
as
the
loss
of
his
hobby-horse
.
--
Never
*NL*
mind
,
brother
Toby
,
he
would
say
,
--
by
God
's
blessing
we
shall
have
*NL*
another
war
break
out
again
some
of
these
days
;
and
when
it
does
,
--
the
*NL*
belligerent
powers
,
if
they
would
hang
themselves
,
can
not
keep
us
out
of
*NL*
play
.
--
I
defy
'em
,
my
dear
Toby
,
he
would
add
,
to
take
countries
without
*NL*
taking
towns
,
--
or
towns
without
sieges
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
never
took
this
back-stroke
of
my
father
's
at
his
*NL*
hobby-horse
kindly
.
--
He
thought
the
stroke
ungenerous
;
and
the
more
*NL*
so
,
because
in
striking
the
horse
he
hit
the
rider
too
,
and
in
the
most
*NL*
dishonourable
part
a
blow
could
fall
;
so
that
upon
these
occasions
,
*NL*
he
always
laid
down
his
pipe
upon
the
table
with
more
fire
to
defend
*NL*
himself
than
common
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
told
the
reader
,
this
time
two
years
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
was
not
*NL*
eloquent
;
and
in
the
very
same
page
gave
an
instance
to
the
contrary
:
--
I
*NL*
repeat
the
observation
,
and
a
fact
which
contradicts
it
again
.
--
He
*NL*
was
not
eloquent
,
--
it
was
not
easy
to
my
uncle
Toby
to
make
long
*NL*
harangues
,
--
and
he
hated
florid
ones
;
but
there
were
occasions
where
the
*NL*
stream
overflowed
the
man
,
and
ran
so
counter
to
its
usual
course
,
*NL*
that
in
some
parts
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
a
time
,
was
at
least
equal
to
*NL*
Tertullus
--
but
in
others
,
in
my
own
opinion
,
infinitely
above
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
was
so
highly
pleased
with
one
of
these
apologetical
orations
*NL*
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
which
he
had
delivered
one
evening
before
him
and
*NL*
Yorick
,
that
he
wrote
it
down
before
he
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
it
amongst
my
father
's
papers
,
*NL*
with
here
and
there
an
insertion
of
his
own
,
betwixt
two
crooks

I
may
safely
say
,
I
have
read
over
this
apologetical
oration
of
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
's
a
hundred
times
,
and
think
it
so
fine
a
model
of
defence
,
--
and
*NL*
shews
so
sweet
a
temperament
of
gallantry
and
good
principles
in
him
,
*NL*
that
I
give
it

*NL*
My
Uncle
Toby
's
Apologetical
Oration
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
insensible
,
brother
Shandy
,
that
when
a
man
whose
profession
*NL*
is
arms
,
wishes
,
as
I
have
done
,
for
war
,
--
it
has
an
ill
aspect
to
the
*NL*
world
;
--
and
that
,
how
just
and
right
soever
his
motives
the
intentions
*NL*
may
be
,
--
he
stands
in
an
uneasy
posture
in
vindicating
himself
from
*NL*
private
views
in
doing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
cause
,
if
a
soldier
is
a
prudent
man
,
which
he
may
be
without
*NL*
being
a
jot
the
less
brave
,
he
will
be
sure
not
to
utter
his
wish
in
*NL*
the
hearing
of
an
enemy
;
for
say
what
he
will
,
an
enemy
will
not
believe
*NL*
him
.
--
He
will
be
cautious
of
doing
it
even
to
a
friend
,
--
lest
he
may
*NL*
suffer
in
his
esteem
:
--
But
if
his
heart
is
overcharged
,
and
a
secret
*NL*
sigh
for
arms
must
have
its
vent
,
he
will
reserve
it
for
the
ear
of
*NL*
a
brother
,
who
knows
his
character
to
the
bottom
,
and
what
his
true
*NL*
notions
,
dispositions
,
and
principles
of
honour
are
:
What
,
I
hope
,
I
*NL*
have
been
in
all
these
,
brother
Shandy
,
would
be
unbecoming
in
me
to
*NL*
say
:
--
much
worse
,
I
know
,
have
I
been
than
I
ought
,
--
and
something
*NL*
worse
,
perhaps
,
than
I
think
:
But
such
as
I
am
,
you
,
my
dear
brother
*NL*
Shandy
,
who
have
sucked
the
same
breasts
with
me
,
--
and
with
whom
I
have
*NL*
been
brought
up
from
my
cradle
,
--
and
from
whose
knowledge
,
from
the
*NL*
first
hours
of
our
boyish
pastimes
,
down
to
this
,
I
have
concealed
*NL*
no
one
action
of
my
life
,
and
scarce
a
thought
in
it
--
Such
as
I
am
,
*NL*
brother
,
you
must
by
this
time
know
me
,
with
all
my
vices
,
and
with
*NL*
all
my
weaknesses
too
,
whether
of
my
age
,
my
temper
,
my
passions
,
or
my
*NL*
understanding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tell
me
then
,
my
dear
brother
Shandy
,
upon
which
of
them
it
is
,
that
*NL*
when
I
condemned
the
peace
of
Utrecht
,
and
grieved
the
war
was
not
*NL*
carried
on
with
vigour
a
little
longer
,
you
should
think
your
brother
*NL*
did
it
upon
unworthy
views
;
or
that
in
wishing
for
war
,
he
should
be
bad
*NL*
enough
to
wish
more
of
his
fellow-creatures
slain
,
--
more
slaves
made
,
*NL*
and
more
families
driven
from
their
peaceful
habitations
,
merely
for
his
*NL*
own
pleasure
:
--
Tell
me
,
brother
Shandy
,
upon
what
one
deed
of
mine
do
*NL*
you
ground
it
?
-LRB-
The
devil
a
deed
do
I
know
of
,
dear
Toby
,
but
one
for
a
*NL*
hundred
pounds
,
which
I
lent
thee
to
carry
on
these
cursed
sieges
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
If
,
when
I
was
a
school-boy
,
I
could
not
hear
a
drum
beat
,
but
my
heart
*NL*
beat
with
it
--
was
it
my
fault
?
--
Did
I
plant
the
propensity
there
?
--
Did
I
*NL*
sound
the
alarm
within
,
or
Nature
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
Guy
,
Earl
of
Warwick
,
and
Parismus
and
Parismenus
,
and
Valentine
*NL*
and
Orson
,
and
the
Seven
Champions
of
England
,
were
handed
around
the
*NL*
school
,
--
were
they
not
all
purchased
with
my
own
pocket-money
?
Was
that
*NL*
selfish
,
brother
Shandy
?
When
we
read
over
the
siege
of
Troy
,
which
*NL*
lasted
ten
years
and
eight
months
,
--
though
with
such
a
train
of
*NL*
artillery
as
we
had
at
Namur
,
the
town
might
have
been
carried
in
a
*NL*
week
--
was
I
not
as
much
concerned
for
the
destruction
of
the
Greeks
and
*NL*
Trojans
as
any
boy
of
the
whole
school
?
Had
I
not
three
strokes
of
a
*NL*
ferula
given
me
,
two
on
my
right
hand
,
and
one
on
my
left
,
for
calling
*NL*
Helena
a
bitch
for
it
?
Did
any
one
of
you
shed
more
tears
for
Hector
?
*NL*
And
when
king
Priam
came
to
the
camp
to
beg
his
body
,
and
returned
*NL*
weeping
back
to
Troy
without
it
,
--
you
know
,
brother
,
I
could
not
eat
my
*NL*
dinner
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Did
that
bespeak
me
cruel
?
Or
because
,
brother
Shandy
,
my
blood
flew
*NL*
out
into
the
camp
,
and
my
heart
panted
for
war
,
--
was
it
a
proof
it
could
*NL*
not
ache
for
the
distresses
of
war
too
?
*NL*
*NL*
O
brother
!
't
is
one
thing
for
a
soldier
to
gather
laurels
,
--
and
't
is
*NL*
another
to
scatter
cypress
.
--
-LRB-
Who
told
thee
,
my
dear
Toby
,
that
cypress
*NL*
was
used
by
the
antients
on
mournful
occasions
?
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
one
thing
,
brother
Shandy
,
for
a
soldier
to
hazard
his
own
*NL*
life
--
to
leap
first
down
into
the
trench
,
where
he
is
sure
to
be
cut
in
*NL*
pieces
:
--
'T
is
one
thing
,
from
public
spirit
and
a
thirst
of
glory
,
to
*NL*
enter
the
breach
the
first
man
,
--
to
stand
in
the
foremost
rank
,
and
*NL*
march
bravely
on
with
drums
and
trumpets
,
and
colours
flying
about
his
*NL*
ears
:
--
'T
is
one
thing
,
I
say
,
brother
Shandy
,
to
do
this
,
--
and
*NL*
't
is
another
thing
to
reflect
on
the
miseries
of
war
;
--
to
view
the
*NL*
desolations
of
whole
countries
,
and
consider
the
intolerable
fatigues
*NL*
and
hardships
which
the
soldier
himself
,
the
instrument
who
works
them
,
*NL*
is
forced
-LRB-
for
sixpence
a
day
,
if
he
can
get
it
-RRB-
to
undergo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Need
I
be
told
,
dear
Yorick
,
as
I
was
by
you
,
in
Le
Fever
's
funeral
*NL*
sermon
,
That
so
soft
and
gentle
a
creature
,
born
to
love
,
to
mercy
,
and
*NL*
kindness
,
as
man
is
,
was
not
shaped
for
this
?
--
But
why
did
you
not
add
,
*NL*
Yorick
,
--
if
not
by
Nature
--
that
he
is
so
by
Necessity
?
--
For
what
is
war
?
*NL*
what
is
it
,
Yorick
,
when
fought
as
ours
has
been
,
upon
principles
of
*NL*
liberty
,
and
upon
principles
of
honour
--
what
is
it
,
but
the
getting
*NL*
together
of
quiet
and
harmless
people
,
with
their
swords
in
their
hands
,
*NL*
to
keep
the
ambitious
and
the
turbulent
within
bounds
?
And
heaven
is
*NL*
my
witness
,
brother
Shandy
,
that
the
pleasure
I
have
taken
in
these
*NL*
things
,
--
and
that
infinite
delight
,
in
particular
,
which
has
attended
*NL*
my
sieges
in
my
bowling-green
,
has
arose
within
me
,
and
I
hope
in
the
*NL*
corporal
too
,
from
the
consciousness
we
both
had
,
that
in
carrying
them
*NL*
on
,
we
were
answering
the
great
ends
of
our
creation

hoping

if

I

only
beg

not
lay

told

for
in
good
truth
,
when
a
man
is
telling
a
story
in
the
*NL*
strange
way
I
do
mine
,
he
is
obliged
continually
to
be
going
backwards
*NL*
and
forwards
to
keep
all
tight
together
in
the
reader
's
fancy
--
which
,
*NL*
for
my
own
part
,
if
I
did
not
take
heed
to
do
more
than
at
first
,
there
*NL*
is
so
much
unfixed
and
equivocal
matter
starting
up
,
with
so
many
breaks
*NL*
and
gaps
in
it
,
--
and
so
little
service
do
the
stars
afford
,
which
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
I
hang
up
in
some
of
the
darkest
passages
,
knowing
that
*NL*
the
world
is
apt
to
lose
its
way
,
with
all
the
lights
the
sun
itself
at

noon-day
can
give
it

now
you
see

I
am

myself

But
't
is
my

fault

and
whenever
my
brains
come
to
be

dissected
,
you
will
perceive
,
without
spectacles

that
he
has
left
a

large
uneven
thread

you
sometimes
see
in
an
unsaleable
piece
of

cambrick

running
along

untowardly

you

not
so

cut
out

in

apologetical
oration
,

though
in
a
different

trope
from
what
I
should
make
use
of
now

That
the
peace
of
Utrecht
was
*NL*
within
an
ace

creating
the

shyness

indignant
way

dismounts

horse

as

as
says
to
him
,
`
I
'll
go
afoot

Toby
could
not
be
said
to
dismount
his
horse
in
this
manner
;
for
*NL*
in
strictness
of
language
,
he
could
not
be
said
to
dismount
his
horse
at
*NL*
all
--
his
horse
rather
flung
him
--
and
somewhat
viciously
,
which
made
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
take
it
ten
times
more
unkindly
.
Let
this
matter
be
settled
*NL*
by
state-jockies
as
they
like
.
--
It
created
,
I
say
,
a
sort
of
shyness
*NL*
betwixt
my
uncle
Toby
and
his
hobby-horse
.
--
He
had
no
occasion
for
him
*NL*
from
the
month
of
March
to
November
,
which
was
the
summer
after
the
*NL*
articles
were
signed
,
except
it
was
now
and
then
to
take
a
short
ride
*NL*
out
,
just
to
see
that
the
fortifications
and
harbour
of
Dunkirk
were
*NL*
demolished
,
according
to
stipulation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
were
so
backwards
all
that
summer
in
setting
about
that
*NL*
affair
,
and
Monsieur
Tugghe
,
the
deputy
from
the
magistrates
of
Dunkirk
,
*NL*
presented
so
many
affecting
petitions
to
the
queen
,
--
beseeching
her
*NL*
majesty
to
cause
only
her
thunderbolts
to
fall
upon
the
martial
works
,
*NL*
which
might
have
incurred
her
displeasure
,
--
but
to
spare
--
to
spare
the
*NL*
mole
,
for
the
mole
's
sake
;
which
,
in
its
naked
situation
,
could
be
no
*NL*
more
than
an
object
of
pity
--
and
the
queen
-LRB-
who
was
but
a
woman
-RRB-
being
*NL*
of
a
pitiful
disposition
,
--
and
her
ministers
also
,
they
not
wishing
*NL*
in
their
hearts
to
have
the
town
dismantled
,
for
these
private
*NL*
reasons
,
...
--
...
;
so
that
the
whole
went
heavily
on
with
my
uncle
Toby
;
*NL*
insomuch
,
that
it
was
not
within
three
full
months
,
after
he
and
the
*NL*
corporal
had
constructed
the
town
,
and
put
it
in
a
condition
to
be
*NL*
destroyed
,
that
the
several
commandants
,
commissaries
,
deputies
,
*NL*
negociators
,
and
intendants
,
would
permit
him
to
set
about
it
.
--
Fatal
*NL*
interval
of
inactivity
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
was
for
beginning
the
demolition
,
by
making
a
breach
in
the
*NL*
ramparts
,
or
main
fortifications
of
the
town
--
No
,
--
that
will
never
do
,
*NL*
corporal
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
in
going
that
way
to
work
with
the
*NL*
town
,
the
English
garrison
will
not
be
safe
in
it
an
hour
;
because
*NL*
if
the
French
are
treacherous
--
They
are
as
treacherous
as
devils
,
an
'
*NL*
please
your
honour
,
said
the
corporal
--
It
gives
me
concern
always
when
*NL*
I
hear
it
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
;
--
for
they
do
n't
want
personal
*NL*
bravery
;
and
if
a
breach
is
made
in
the
ramparts
,
they
may
enter
it
,
and
*NL*
make
themselves
masters
of
the
place
when
they
please
:
--
Let
them
enter
*NL*
it
,
said
the
corporal
,
lifting
up
his
pioneer
's
spade
in
both
his
hands
,
*NL*
as
if
he
was
going
to
lay
about
him
with
it
,
--
let
them
enter
,
an
'
please
*NL*
your
honour
,
if
they
dare
.
--
In
cases
like
this
,
corporal
,
said
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
slipping
his
right
hand
down
to
the
middle
of
his
cane
,
*NL*
and
holding
it
afterwards
truncheon-wise
with
his
fore-finger
*NL*
extended
,
--
't
is
no
part
of
the
consideration
of
a
commandant
,
what
the
*NL*
enemy
dare
,
--
or
what
they
dare
not
do
;
he
must
act
with
prudence
.
We
*NL*
will
begin
with
the
outworks
both
towards
the
sea
and
the
land
,
and
*NL*
particularly
with
fort
Louis
,
the
most
distant
of
them
all
,
and
demolish
*NL*
it
first
,
--
and
the
rest
,
one
by
one
,
both
on
our
right
and
left
,
as
we
*NL*
retreat
towards
the
town
;
--
then
we
'll
demolish
the
mole
,
--
next
fill
up
*NL*
the
harbour
,
--
then
retire
into
the
citadel
,
and
blow
it
up
into
the
air
:
*NL*
and
having
done
that
,
corporal
,
we
'll
embark
for
England
.
--
We
are
there
,
*NL*
quoth
the
corporal
,
recollecting
himself
--
Very

my

Toby

at

A
delusive
,
delicious
consultation
or
two
of
this
kind
,
betwixt
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
and
Trim
,
upon
the
demolition
of
Dunkirk
,
--
for
a
moment
rallied
*NL*
back
the
ideas
of
those
pleasures
,
which
were
slipping
from
under
*NL*
him
:
--
still
--
still
all
went
on
heavily
--
the
magic
left
the
mind
the
*NL*
weaker
--
Stillness
,
with
Silence
at
her
back
,
entered
the
solitary
*NL*
parlour
,
and
drew
their
gauzy
mantle
over
my
uncle
Toby
's
head
;
--
and
*NL*
Listlessness
,
with
her
lax
fibre
and
undirected
eye
,
sat
quietly
*NL*
down
beside
him
in
his
arm-chair
.
--
No
longer
Amberg
and
Rhinberg
,
and
*NL*
Limbourg
,
and
Huy
,
and
Bonn
,
in
one

,

and
the
prospect
of
Landen
,
*NL*
and
Trerebach
,
and
Drusen
,
and
Dendermond
,
the
next
,
--
hurried
on
the
*NL*
blood
:
--
No
longer
did
saps
,
and
mines
,
and
blinds
,
and
gabions
,
and
*NL*
palisadoes
,
keep
out
this
fair
enemy
of
man
's
repose
:
--
No
more
could
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
after
passing
the
French
lines
,
as
he
eat
his
egg
at
supper
,
*NL*
from
thence
break
into
the
heart
of
France
,

cross
over
the
Oyes
,
and
*NL*
with
all
Picardie
open
behind
him
,
march
up
to
the
gates
of
Paris
,
and
*NL*
fall
asleep
with
nothing
but
ideas
of
glory
:
--
No
more
was
he
to
dream
,
*NL*
he
had
fixed
the
royal
standard
upon
the
tower
of
the
Bastile
,

awake
*NL*
with
it
streaming
in
his
head
.

Softer

stole
sweetly

of
war
fell
out

he
took
up
the
*NL*
lute
,
sweet
instrument

of
all
others
the
most

the

difficult

Now
,
because
I
have
once
or
twice
said
,
in
my
inconsiderate
way
of
*NL*
talking
,
That
I
was
confident
the
following
memoirs
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
courtship
of
widow
Wadman
,
whenever
I
got
time
to
write
them
,
would
*NL*
turn
out
one
of
the
most
complete
systems
,
both
of
the
elementary
and
*NL*
practical
part
of
love
and
love-making
,
that
ever
was
addressed
to
*NL*
the
world
--
are
you
to
imagine
from
thence
,
that
I
shall
set
out
with
*NL*
a
description
of
what
love
is
?
whether
part
God
and
part
Devil
,
as
*NL*
Plotinus
will
have
it
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Or
by
a
more
critical
equation
,
and
supposing
the
whole
of
love
to
be
*NL*
as
ten
--
to
determine
with
Ficinus
,
`
How
many
parts
of
it
--
the
one
,
--
and
*NL*
how
many
the
other
;
'
--
or
whether
it
is
all
of
it
one
great
Devil
,
from
*NL*
head
to
tail
,
as
Plato
has
taken
upon
him
to
pronounce
;
concerning
which
*NL*
conceit
of
his
,
I
shall
not
offer
my
opinion
:
--
but
my
opinion
of
Plato
*NL*
is
this
;
that
he
appears
,
from
this
instance
,
to
have
been
a
man
of
much
*NL*
the
same
temper
and
way
of
reasoning
with
doctor
Baynyard
,
who
being
a
*NL*
great
enemy
to
blisters
,
as
imagining
that
half
a
dozen
of
'em
at
once
,
*NL*
would
draw
a
man
as
surely
to
his
grave
,
as
a
herse
and
six
--
rashly
*NL*
concluded
,
that
the
Devil
himself
was
nothing
in
the
world
,
but
one
*NL*
great
bouncing
Cantharidis
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
people
who
allow
themselves
this
monstrous
*NL*
liberty
in
arguing
,
but
what
Nazianzen
cried
out
-LRB-
that
is
,
polemically
-RRB-
*NL*
to
Philagrius
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
-LRB-

-RRB-

'
O

't

,

-LRB-

'
and
most
*NL*
nobly
do
you
aim
at
truth
,
when
you
philosophize
about
it
in
your
moods
*NL*
and
passions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
is
it
to
be
imagined
,
for
the
same
reason
,
I
should
stop
to
*NL*
inquire
,
whether
love
is
a
disease
,
--
or
embroil
myself
with
Rhasis
and
*NL*
Dioscorides
,
whether
the
seat
of
it
is
in
the
brain
or
liver
;
--
because
*NL*
this
would
lead
me
on
,
to
an
examination
of
the
two
very
opposite
*NL*
manners
,
in
which
patients
have
been
treated
--
the
one
,
of
Aoetius
,
*NL*
who
always
begun
with
a
cooling
clyster
of
hempseed
and
bruised
*NL*
cucumbers
;
--
and
followed
on
with
thin
potations
of
water-lilies
and
*NL*
purslane
--
to
which
he
added
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
of
the
herb
Hanea
;
--
and
*NL*
where
Aoetius
durst
venture
it
,
--
his
topaz-ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
other
,
that
of
Gordonius
,
who
-LRB-
in
his
cap

de

directs
*NL*
they
should
be
thrashed

`

stink
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
are
disquisitions
which
my
father
,
who
had
laid
in
a
great
stock
*NL*
of
knowledge
of
this
kind
,
will
be
very
busy
with
in
the
progress
of
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
affairs
:
I
must
anticipate
thus
much
,
That
from
his
*NL*
theories
of
love
,
-LRB-
with
which
,
by
the
way
,
he
contrived
to
crucify
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
mind
,
almost
as
much
as
his
amours
themselves
,
-RRB-
--
he
took
*NL*
a
single
step
into
practice
;
--
and
by
means
of
a
camphorated
cerecloth
,
*NL*
which
he
found
means
to
impose
upon
the
taylor
for
buckram
,
whilst
he
*NL*
was
making
my
uncle
Toby
a
new
pair
of
breeches
,
he
produced
Gordonius
's
*NL*
effect
upon
my
uncle
Toby
without
the
disgrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
changes
this
produced
,
will
be
read
in
its
proper
place
:
all
that
*NL*
is
needful
to
be
added
to
the
anecdote
,
is
this
--
That
whatever
effect
it
*NL*
had
upon
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
it
had
a
vile
effect
upon

house
;

if

not
smoaked

down

what

why

telling

my

fell
in
love
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
that
the
phrase
is
at
all
to
my
liking
:
for
to
say
a
man
is
fallen
*NL*
in
love
,
--
or
that
he
is
deeply
in
love
,
--
or
up
to
the
ears
in
love
,
--
and
*NL*
sometimes
even
over
head
and
ears
in
it
,
--
carries
an
idiomatical
kind
of
*NL*
implication
,
that
love
is
a
thing
below
a
man
:
--
this
is
recurring
again
*NL*
to
Plato
's
opinion
,
which
,
with
all
his
divinityship
,
--
I
hold
to
be
*NL*
damnable
and
heretical
:

and
so
much
for
that

Let
love
therefore
be
what
it
will

my

fell
into

And
possibly
,
gentle

with
such
a
temptation

so
wouldst

For
never
did
thy

concupiscence
covet

one
of
his
second
beds
of
justice
,
and
*NL*
was
musing
within
himself
about
the
hardships
of
matrimony
,
as
my
mother
*NL*
broke
silence
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
My
brother
Toby
,
'
quoth
she
,
`
is
going
to
be
married
to
Mrs.
Wadman
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
--
Then
he
will
never
,
quoth
my
father
,
be
able
to
lie
diagonally
in
his
*NL*
bed
again
as
long
as
he
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
consuming
vexation
to
my
father
,
that
my
mother
never
asked
the
*NL*
meaning
of
a
thing
she
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
she
is
not
a
woman
of
science
,
my
father
would
say
--
is
her
*NL*
misfortune
--
but
she
might
ask
a
question
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
never
did
.
--
In
short
,
she
went
out
of
the
world
at
last
*NL*
without
knowing
whether
it
turned
round
,
or
stood
still
.
--
My
father
had
*NL*
officiously
told
her
above
a
thousand
times
which
way
it
was
,
--
but
she
*NL*
always
forgot
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
these
reasons
,
a
discourse
seldom
went
on
much
further
betwixt
them
,
*NL*
than
a
proposition
,
--
a
reply
,
and
a
rejoinder
;
at
the
end
of
which
,
*NL*
it
generally
took
breath
for
a
few
minutes
-LRB-
as
in
the
affair
of
the
*NL*
breeches
-RRB-
,
and
then
went
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
marries
,
`
twill
be
the
worse
for
us
,
--
quoth
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
cherry-stone
,
said
my
father
,
--
he
may
as
well
batter
away
his
*NL*
means
upon
that
,
as
any
thing
else
,
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
be
sure
,
said
my
mother
:
so
here
ended
the
proposition
--
the
*NL*
reply
,
--
and
the
rejoinder
,
I
told
you
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
some
amusement
to
him
,
too
,
--
said
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
great
one
,
answered
my
mother
,
if
he
should
have
children
.

Lord
have
mercy
upon
me

I
am
now
beginning
to
get
fairly
into

;
and
by
the
help
of
a
*NL*
vegetable
diet
,
with
a
few
of
the
cold
seeds
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
I
*NL*
shall
be
able
to
go
on
with
my
uncle
Toby
's
story
,
and
my
own
,
in
a
*NL*
tolerable
straight
line
.
Now
,
*NL*
*NL*

four
very
squiggly
lines
across
the

signed
Inv.T.S

These
were
the
four
lines
I
moved
in
through
my
first

second
,
third
,
*NL*
and
fourth
volumes
-LRB-
Alluding
to
the
first
edition

In
the
fifth
volume
*NL*
I
have
been
very
good
,
--
the
precise
line
I
have
described
in
it
being
*NL*
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
one
very
squiggly
line
across
the
page
with
loops
marked

it
appears

that
except
at
the
curve
,
marked
A.
where
I
took
*NL*
a
trip
to
Navarre
,
--
and
the
indented
curve
B.
which
is
the
short
airing
*NL*
when
I
was
there
with
the
Lady
Baussiere
and
her
page
,
--
I
have
not
taken
*NL*
the
least
frisk
of
a
digression
,
till
John
de
la
Casse
's
devils
led
me
*NL*
the
round
you
see
marked
D.
--
for
as
for
C
C
C
C
C
they
are
nothing
but
*NL*
parentheses
,
and
the
common
ins
and
outs
incident
to
the
lives
of
*NL*
the
greatest
ministers
of
state
;
and
when
compared
with
what
men
have
*NL*
done
,
--
or
with
my
own
transgressions
at
the
letters
ABD
--
they
vanish
*NL*
into
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
last
volume
I
have
done
better
still
--
for
from
the
end
of
Le
*NL*
Fever
's
episode
,
to
the
beginning
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
campaigns
,
--
I
have
*NL*
scarce
stepped
a
yard
out
of
my
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
I
mend
at
this
rate
,
it
is
not
impossible
--
by
the
good
leave
of
*NL*
his
grace
of
Benevento
's
devils
--
but
I
may
arrive
hereafter
at
the
*NL*
excellency
of
going
on
even
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
straight
line
across
the
page
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
which
is
a
line
drawn
as
straight
as
I
could
draw
it
,
by
a
*NL*
writing-master
's
ruler
-LRB-
borrowed
for
that
purpose
-RRB-
,
turning
neither
to
*NL*
the
right
hand
or
to
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
right
line
,
--
the
path-way
for
Christians
to
walk
in
!

The
emblem
of
moral
rectitude
!
says
Cicero
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
best
line

say
cabbage
planters

is
the
shortest
line

says
*NL*
Archimedes
,
which
can
be
drawn
from
one
given
point
to
another

wish

lay
this
matter
to

What
a
journey

Pray
can
you
tell
me
,

that
is
,
without
anger
,
before
I
write
my
chapter
*NL*
upon
straight
lines
--
by
what
mistake

who
told
them
so
--
or
how
it
has
*NL*
come
to
pass
,

your

No

I
think

I
said

I
would
write
two
volumes
every
year
,
provided
the
*NL*
vile
cough
which
then
tormented
me
,
and
which
to
this
hour
I
dread
worse
*NL*
than
the
devil
,
would
but
give
me
leave
--
and
in
another
place
--
-LRB-
but
*NL*
where
,
I
ca
n't
recollect
now
-RRB-
speaking
of
my
book
as
a
machine
,
and
*NL*
laying
my
pen
and
ruler
down
cross-wise
upon
the
table
,
in
order
to
gain
*NL*
the
greater
credit
to
it
--
I
swore
it
should
be
kept
a
going
at
that
rate
*NL*
these
forty
years
,
if
it
pleased
but
the
fountain
of
life
to
bless
me
so
*NL*
long
with
health
and
good
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
as
for
my
spirits
,
little
have
I
to
lay
to
their
charge
--
nay
so
very
*NL*
little
-LRB-
unless
the
mounting
me
upon
a
long
stick
and
playing
the
fool
*NL*
with
me
nineteen
hours
out
of
the
twenty-four
,
be
accusations
-RRB-
that
on
*NL*
the
contrary
,
I
have
much
--
much
to
thank
'em
for
:
cheerily
have
ye
made
*NL*
me
tread
the
path
of
life
with
all
the
burthens
of
it
-LRB-
except
its
cares
-RRB-
*NL*
upon
my
back
;
in
no
one
moment
of
my
existence
,
that
I
remember
,
have
*NL*
ye
once
deserted
me
,
or
tinged
the
objects
which
came
in
my
way
,
either
*NL*
with
sable
,
or
with
a
sickly
green
;
in
dangers
ye
gilded
my
horizon
with
*NL*
hope
,
and
when
Death
himself
knocked
at
my
door
--
ye
bad
him
come
again
;
*NL*
and
in
so
gay
a
tone
of
careless
indifference
,
did
ye
do
it
,
that
he
*NL*
doubted
of
his
commission
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
There
must
certainly
be
some
mistake
in
this
matter

quoth
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
there
is
nothing
in
this
world
I
abominate
worse
,
than
to
be
*NL*
interrupted
in
a
story
--
and
I
was
that
moment
telling
Eugenius
a
most
*NL*
tawdry
one
in
my
way
,
of
a
nun
who
fancied
herself
a
shell-fish
,
and
of
*NL*
a
monk
damn
'd
for
eating
a
muscle
,
and
was
shewing
him
the
grounds
and
*NL*
justice
of
the
procedure
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
Did
ever
so
grave
a
personage
get
into
so
vile
a
scrape
?
'
quoth
*NL*
Death
.
Thou
hast
had
a
narrow
escape
,
Tristram
,
said
Eugenius
,
taking
*NL*
hold
of
my
hand
as
I
finished
my
story
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
is
no
living
,
Eugenius
,
replied
I
,
at
this
rate
;
for
as
this
*NL*
son
of
a
whore
has
found
out
my
lodgings
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
You
call
him
rightly
,
said
Eugenius
,
--
for
by
sin
,
we
are
told
,
he
*NL*
enter
'd
the
world
--
I
care
not
which
way
he
enter
'd
,
quoth
I
,
provided
he
*NL*
be
not
in
such
a
hurry
to
take
me
out
with
him
--
for
I
have
forty
volumes
*NL*
to
write
,
and
forty
thousand
things
to
say
and
do
which
no
body
in
the
*NL*
world
will
say
and
do
for
me
,
except
thyself
;
and
as
thou
seest
he
has
*NL*
got
me
by
the
throat
-LRB-
for
Eugenius
could
scarce
hear
me
speak
across
*NL*
the
table
-RRB-
,
and
that
I
am
no
match
for
him
in
the
open
field
,
had
I
not
*NL*
better
,
whilst
these
few
scatter
'd
spirits
remain
,
and
these
two
spider
*NL*
legs
of
mine
-LRB-
holding
one
of
them
up
to
him
-RRB-
are
able
to
support
*NL*
me
--
had
I
not
better
,
Eugenius
,
fly
for
my
life
?
'T
is
my
advice
,
my
*NL*
dear
Tristram
,
said
Eugenius
--
Then
by
heaven
!
I
will
lead
him
a
dance
*NL*
he
little
thinks
of
--
for
I
will
gallop
,
quoth
I
,
without
looking
once
*NL*
behind
me
,
to
the
banks
of
the
Garonne
;
and
if
I
hear
him
clattering
at
*NL*
my
heels
--
I
'll
scamper
away
to
mount
Vesuvius
--
from
thence
to
Joppa
,
and
*NL*
from
Joppa
to
the
world
's
end
;
where
,
if
he
follows
me
,
I
pray
God
he
*NL*
may
break
his
neck
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
runs
more
risk
there
,
said
Eugenius
,
than
thou
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eugenius
's
wit
and
affection
brought
blood
into
the
cheek
from
whence
it
*NL*
had
been
some
months
banish
'd
--
't
was
a
vile
moment
to
bid
adieu
in

he
*NL*
led
me
to
my
chaise

Allons

said
I
;
the
post-boy
gave
a
crack
with
*NL*
his
whip

off
I
went
like

got

I

*NL*
know
something
of
his

I
*NL*

took
notice
of

to
give
some
account
of
it
.
'
--
Now
I
think
it
very
much
amiss
--
that
*NL*
a
man
can
not
go
quietly
through
a
town
and
let
it
alone
,
when
it
does
*NL*
not
meddle
with
him
,
but
that
he
must
be
turning
about
and
drawing
his
*NL*
pen
at
every
kennel
he
crosses
over
,
merely
o
'
my
conscience
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
drawing
it
;
because
,
if
we
may
judge
from
what
has
been
wrote
of
*NL*
these
things
,
by
all
who
have
wrote
and
gallop
'd
--
or
who
have
gallop
'd
*NL*
and
wrote
,
which
is
a
different
way
still
;
or
who
,
for
more
expedition
*NL*
than
the
rest
,
have
wrote
galloping
,
which
is
the
way
I
do
at
*NL*
present
--
from
the
great
Addison
,
who
did
it
with
his
satchel
of
school
*NL*
books
hanging
at
his
a.
.
.
,
and
galling
his
beast
's
crupper
at
every
*NL*
stroke
--
there
is
not
a
gallopper
of
us
all
who
might
not
have
gone
on
*NL*
ambling
quietly
in
his
own
ground
-LRB-
in
case
he
had
any
-RRB-
,
and
have
wrote
*NL*
all
he
had
to
write
,
dry-shod
,
as
well
as
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
as
heaven
is
my
judge
,
and
to
which
I
shall
ever
make
*NL*
my
last
appeal
--
I
know
no
more
of
Calais
-LRB-
except
the
little
my
barber
*NL*
told
me
of
it
as
he
was
whetting
his
razor
-RRB-
than
I
do
this
moment
of
*NL*
Grand
Cairo
;
for
it
was
dusky
in
the
evening
when
I
landed
,
and
dark
as
*NL*
pitch
in
the
morning
when
I
set
out
,
and
yet
by
merely
knowing
what
*NL*
is
what
,
and
by
drawing
this
from
that
in
one
part
of
the
town
,
and
by
*NL*
spelling
and
putting
this
and
that
together
in
another
--
I
would
lay
any
*NL*
travelling
odds
,
that
I
this
moment
write
a
chapter
upon
Calais
as
long
*NL*
as
my
arm
;
and
with
so
distinct
and
satisfactory
a
detail
of
every
item
,
*NL*
which
is
worth
a
stranger
's
curiosity
in
the
town
--
that
you
would
take
*NL*
me
for
the
town-clerk
of
Calais
itself
--
and
where
,
sir
,
would
be
*NL*
the
wonder
?
was
not
Democritus
,
who
laughed
ten
times
more
than
*NL*
I
--
town-clerk
of
Abdera
?
and
was
not
-LRB-
I
forget
his
name
-RRB-
who
had
more
*NL*
discretion
than
us
both
,
town-clerk
of
Ephesus
?

it
should
be
penn
'd

with

This
town
,
if
we
may
trust
its
archives
,
the
authority
of
which
I
see
no
*NL*
reason
to
call
in
question
in
this
place
--
was
once
no
more
than
a
small
*NL*
village
belonging
to
one
of
the
first
Counts
de
Guignes
;
and
as
it
*NL*
boasts
at
present
of
no
less
than
fourteen
thousand
inhabitants
,
*NL*
exclusive
of
four
hundred
and
twenty
distinct
families
in
the
basse
*NL*
ville
,
or
suburbs
--
it
must
have
grown
up
by
little
and
little
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
to
its
present
size
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
there
are
four
convents
,
there
is
but
one
parochial
church
in
the
*NL*
whole
town
;
I
had
not
an
opportunity
of
taking
its
exact
dimensions
,
but
*NL*
it
is
pretty
easy
to
make
a
tolerable
conjecture
of
'em
--
for
as
there
*NL*
are
fourteen
thousand
inhabitants
in
the
town
,
if
the
church
holds
them
*NL*
all
it
must
be
considerably
large
--
and
if
it
will
not
--
't
is
a
very
*NL*
great
pity
they
have
not
another
--
it
is
built
in
form
of
a
cross
,
and
*NL*
dedicated
to
the
Virgin
Mary
;
the
steeple
,
which
has
a
spire
to
it
,
is
*NL*
placed
in
the
middle
of
the
church
,
and
stands
upon
four
pillars
elegant
*NL*
and
light
enough
,
but
sufficiently
strong
at
the
same
time
--
it
is
*NL*
decorated
with
eleven
altars
,
most
of
which
are
rather
fine
than
*NL*
beautiful
.
The
great
altar
is
a
master-piece
in
its
kind
;
't
is
of
white
*NL*
marble
,
and
,
as
I
was
told
,
near
sixty
feet
high
--
had
it
been
much
*NL*
higher
,
it
had
been
as
high
as
mount
Calvary
itself
--
therefore
,
I
*NL*
suppose
it
must
be
high
enough
in
all
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
struck
me
more
than
the
great
Square
;
tho
'
I
can
not
*NL*
say
't
is
either
well
paved
or
well
built
;
but
't
is
in
the
heart
of
the
*NL*
town
,
and
most
of
the
streets
,
especially
those
in
that
quarter
,
all
*NL*
terminate
in
it
;
could
there
have
been
a
fountain
in
all
Calais
,
*NL*
which
it
seems
there
can
not
,
as
such
an
object
would
have
been
a
great
*NL*
ornament
,
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
,
but
that
the
inhabitants
would
have
*NL*
had
it
in
the
very
centre
of
this
square
,
--
not
that
it
is
properly
a
*NL*
square
,
--
because
't
is
forty
feet
longer
from
east
to
west
,
than
from
*NL*
north
to
south
;
so
that
the
French
in
general
have
more
reason
on
their
*NL*
side
in
calling
them
Places
than
Squares
,
which
,
strictly
speaking
,
to
*NL*
be
sure
,
they
are
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
town-house
seems
to
be
but
a
sorry
building
,
and
not
to
be
kept
in
*NL*
the
best
repair
;
otherwise
it
had
been
a
second
great
ornament
to
this
*NL*
place
;
it
answers
however
its
destination
,
and
serves
very
well
for
the
*NL*
reception
of
the
magistrates
,
who
assemble
in
it
from
time
to
time
;
so
*NL*
that
't
is
presumable
,
justice
is
regularly
distributed
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
heard
much
of
it
,
but
there
is
nothing
at
all
curious
in
the
*NL*
Courgain
;
't
is
a
distinct
quarter
of
the
town
,
inhabited
solely
by
*NL*
sailors
and
fishermen
;
it
consists
of
a
number
of
small
streets
,
neatly
*NL*
built
and
mostly
of
brick
;
't
is
extremely
populous
,
but
as
that
may
*NL*
be
accounted
for
,
from
the
principles
of
their
diet
,
--
there
is
nothing
*NL*
curious
in
that
neither
.
--
A
traveller
may
see
it
to
satisfy
himself
--
he
*NL*
must
not
omit
however
taking
notice
of
La
Tour
de
Guet
,
upon
any
*NL*
account
;
't
is
so
called
from
its
particular
destination
,
because
in
war
*NL*
it
serves
to
discover
and
give
notice
of
the
enemies
which
approach
the
*NL*
place
,
either
by
sea
or
land
;
--
but
't
is
monstrous
high
,
and
catches
the
*NL*
eye
so
continually
,
you
can
not
avoid
taking
notice
of
it
if
you
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
singular
disappointment
to
me
,
that
I
could
not
have
permission
*NL*
to
take
an
exact
survey
of
the
fortifications
,
which
are
the
strongest
*NL*
in
the
world
,
and
which
,
from
first
to
last
,
that
is
,
for
the
time
they
*NL*
were
set
about
by
Philip
of
France
,
Count
of
Bologne
,
to
the
present
*NL*
war
,
wherein
many
reparations
were
made
,
have
cost
-LRB-
as
I
learned
*NL*
afterwards
from
an
engineer
in
Gascony
-RRB-
--
above
a
hundred
millions
of
*NL*
livres
.
It
is
very
remarkable
,
that
at
the
Tete
de
Gravelenes
,
and
where
*NL*
the
town
is
naturally
the
weakest
,
they
have
expended
the
most
money
;
*NL*
so
that
the
outworks
stretch
a
great
way
into
the
campaign
,
and
*NL*
consequently
occupy
a
large
tract
of
ground
--
However
,
after
all
that
is
*NL*
said
and
done
,
it
must
be
acknowledged
that
Calais
was
never
upon
any
*NL*
account
so
considerable
from
itself
,
as
from
its
situation
,
and
that
*NL*
easy
entrance
which
it
gave
our
ancestors
,
upon
all
occasions
,
into
*NL*
France
:
it
was
not
without
its
inconveniences
also
;
being
no
less
*NL*
troublesome
to
the
English
in
those
times
,
than
Dunkirk
has
been
to
*NL*
us
,
in
ours
;
so
that
it
was
deservedly
looked
upon
as
the
key
to
both
*NL*
kingdoms
,
which
no
doubt
is
the
reason
that
there
have
arisen
so
many
*NL*
contentions
who
should
keep
it
:
of
these
,
the
siege
of
Calais
,
or
rather
*NL*
the
blockade
-LRB-
for
it
was
shut
up
both
by
land
and
sea
-RRB-
,
was
the
most
*NL*
memorable
,
as
it
with-stood
the
efforts
of
Edward
the
Third
a
whole
*NL*
year
,
and
was
not
terminated
at
last
but
by
famine
and
extreme
misery
;
*NL*
the
gallantry
of
Eustace
de
St.
Pierre
,
who
first
offered
himself
a
*NL*
victim
for
his
fellow-citizens
,
has
rank
'd
his
name
with
heroes
.
As
it
*NL*
will
not
take
up
above
fifty
pages
,
it
would
be
injustice
to
the
reader
,
*NL*
not
to
give
him
a
minute
account
of
that
romantic
transaction
,
as
well
*NL*
as
of
the
siege
itself
,
in
Rapin

in
these
words
;
*NL*
*NL*
That
something
is
always
wrong
in
a
French
post-chaise
,
upon
first
*NL*
setting
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
the
proposition
may
stand
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
A
French
postilion
has
always
to
alight
before
he
has
got
three
hundred
*NL*
yards
out
of
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
's
wrong
now
?
--
Diable
!
--
a
rope
's
broke
!
--
a
knot
has
slipt
!
--
a
*NL*
staple
's
drawn
!
--
a
bolt
's
to
whittle
!
--
a
tag
,
a
rag
,
a
jag
,
a
strap
,
a
*NL*
buckle
,
or
a
buckle
's
tongue
,
want
altering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
true
as
all
this
is
,
I
never
think
myself
impowered
to
excommunicate
*NL*
thereupon
either
the
post-chaise
,
or
its
driver
--
nor
do
I
take
it
*NL*
into
my
head
to
swear
by
the
living
G.
.
,
I
would
rather
go
a-foot
*NL*
ten
thousand
times
--
or
that
I
will
be
damn
'd
,
if
ever
I
get
into
*NL*
another
--
but
I
take
the
matter
coolly
before
me
,
and
consider
,
that
some
*NL*
tag
,
or
rag
,
or
jag
,
or
bolt
,
or
buckle
,
or
buckle
's
tongue
,
will
ever
*NL*
be
a
wanting
or
want
altering
,
travel
where
I
will
--
so
I
never
chaff
,
*NL*
but
take
the
good
and
the
bad
as
they
fall
in
my
road
,
and
get
on
:
--
Do
*NL*
so
,
my
lad
!
said
I
;
he
had
lost
five
minutes
already
,
in
alighting
in
*NL*
order
to
get
at
a
luncheon
of
black
bread
,
which
he
had
cramm
'd
into
the
*NL*
chaise-pocket
,
and
was
remounted
,
and
going
leisurely
on
,
to
relish
it
*NL*
the
better
.
--
Get
on
,
my
lad
,
said
I
,
briskly
--
but
in
the
most
persuasive
*NL*
tone
imaginable
,
for
I
jingled
a
four-and-twenty
sous
piece
against
the
*NL*
glass
,
taking
care
to
hold
the
flat
side
towards
him
,
as
he
look
'd
back
:
*NL*
the
dog
grinn
'd
intelligence
from
his
right
ear
to
his
left
,
and
behind
*NL*
his
sooty
muzzle
discovered
such
a
pearly
row
of
teeth
,
that
Sovereignty
*NL*
would
have
pawn
'd
her
jewels
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
heaven
!
What
masticators
!
--
/
What
bread
--
!
*NL*
*NL*
and
so
as
he
finished
the
last
mouthful
of
it
,
we
entered
the
town
of
*NL*
Montreuil
.

*NL*
There
is
not
a
town
in
all
France
which
,
in
my
opinion
,
looks
better
in
*NL*
the
map
,
than
Montreuil
;
--
I
own
,
it
does
not
look
so
well
in
the
book
*NL*
of
post-roads
;
but
when
you
come
to
see
it
--
to
be
sure
it
looks
most
*NL*
pitifully
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
one
thing
,
however
,
in
it
at
present
very
handsome
;
and
that
*NL*
is
,
the
inn-keeper
's
daughter
:
She
has
been
eighteen
months
at
Amiens
,
*NL*
and
six
at
Paris
,
in
going
through
her
classes
;
so
knits
,
and
sews
,
and
*NL*
dances
,
and
does
the
little
coquetries
very
well
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
slut
!
in
running
them
over
within
these
five
minutes
that
I
have
*NL*
stood
looking
at
her
,
she
has
let
fall
at
least
a
dozen
loops
in
a
white
*NL*
thread
stocking
--
yes
,
yes
--
I
see
,
you
cunning
gipsy
!
--
't
is
long
and
*NL*
taper
--
you
need
not
pin
it
to
your
knee
--
and
that
't
is
your
own
--
and
*NL*
fits
you
exactly
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
Nature
should
have
told
this
creature
a
word
about
a
statue
's
*NL*
thumb
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
as
this
sample
is
worth
all
their
thumbs
--
besides
,
I
have
her
*NL*
thumbs
and
fingers
in
at
the
bargain
,
if
they
can
be
any
guide
to
*NL*
me
,
--
and
as
Janatone
withal
-LRB-
for
that
is
her
name
-RRB-
stands
so
well
for
*NL*
a
drawing
--
may
I
never
draw
more
,
or
rather
may
I
draw
like
a
*NL*
draught-horse
,
by
main
strength
all
the
days
of
my
life
,
--
if
I
do
not
*NL*
draw
her
in
all
her
proportions
,
and
with
as
determined
a
pencil
,
as
if
*NL*
I
had
her
in
the
wettest
drapery
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
your
worships
chuse
rather
that
I
give
you
the
length
,
breadth
,
*NL*
and
perpendicular
height
of
the
great
parish-church
,
or
drawing
of
the
*NL*
facade
of
the
abbey
of
Saint
Austreberte
which
has
been
transported
*NL*
from
Artois
hither
--
every
thing
is
just
I
suppose
as
the
masons
and
*NL*
carpenters
left
them
,
--
and
if
the
belief
in
Christ
continues
so
long
,
*NL*
will
be
so
these
fifty
years
to
come
--
so
your
worships
and
reverences
*NL*
may
all
measure
them
at
your
leisures
--
but
he
who
measures
thee
,
*NL*
Janatone
,
must
do
it
now
--
thou
carriest
the
principles
of
change
within
*NL*
thy
frame
;
and
considering
the
chances
of
a
transitory
life
,
I
would
not
*NL*
answer
for
thee
a
moment
;
ere
twice
twelve
months
are
passed
and
gone
,
*NL*
thou
mayest
grow
out
like
a
pumpkin
,
and
lose
thy
shapes
--
or
thou
mayest
*NL*
go
off
like
a
flower
,
and
lose
thy
beauty
--
nay
,
thou
mayest
go
off
like
*NL*
a
hussy
--
and
lose
thyself
.
--
I
would
not
answer
for
my
aunt
Dinah
,
*NL*
was
she
alive
--
`
faith
,
scarce
for
her
picture
--
were
it
but
painted
by
*NL*
Reynolds
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
if
I
go
on
with
my
drawing
,
after
naming
that
son
of
Apollo
,
I
'll
be
*NL*
shot
--

So
you
must
e
`

be
content
with
the
original
;
which
,
if
the
evening
is
*NL*
fine
in
passing
thro

Montreuil
,
you
will
see
at
your
chaise-door
,
as
*NL*
you
change
horses
:
but
unless
you
have
as
bad
a
reason
for
haste
as
I
*NL*
have
--
you
had
better
stop
:

Was
I
in
a
condition
to
stipulate
with
Death
,
as
I
am
this
moment
with
*NL*
my
apothecary
,
how
and
where
I
will
take
his
clyster
--
I
should
certainly
*NL*
declare
against
submitting
to
it
before
my
friends
;
and
therefore
*NL*
I
never
seriously
think
upon
the
mode
and
manner
of
this
great
*NL*
catastrophe
,
which
generally
takes
up
and
torments
my
thoughts
as
much
*NL*
as
the
catastrophe
itself
;
but
I
constantly
draw
the
curtain
across
it
*NL*
with
this
wish
,
that
the
Disposer
of
all
things
may
so
order
it
,
that
*NL*
it
happen
not
to
me
in
my
own
house
--
but
rather
in
some
decent
inn
--
at
*NL*
home
,
I
know
it
,
--
the
concern
of
my
friends
,
and
the
last
services
of
*NL*
wiping
my
brows
,
and
smoothing
my
pillow
,
which
the
quivering
hand
of
*NL*
pale
affection
shall
pay
me
,
will
so
crucify
my
soul
,
that
I
shall
die
*NL*
of
a
distemper
which
my
physician
is
not
aware
of
:
but
in
an
inn
,
the
*NL*
few
cold
offices
I
wanted
,
would
be
purchased
with
a
few
guineas
,
and
*NL*
paid
me
with
an
undisturbed
,
but
punctual
attention
--
but
mark
.
This
inn
*NL*
should
not
be
the
inn
at
Abbeville
--
if
there
was
not
another
inn
in
the
*NL*
universe
,
I
would
strike
that
inn
out
of
the
capitulation
:
so
*NL*

Let
the
horses
be

Yes

'll

`
Make
them
like
unto
a
wheel
,
'
is
a
bitter
sarcasm
,
as
all
the
learned
*NL*
know
,
against
the
grand
tour
,
and
that
restless
spirit
for
making
it
,
*NL*
which
David
prophetically
foresaw
would
haunt
the
children
of
men
in
the
*NL*
latter
days
;
and
therefore
,
as
thinketh
the
great
bishop
Hall
,
't
is
*NL*
one
of
the
severest
imprecations
which
David
ever
utter
'd
against
the
*NL*
enemies
of
the
Lord
--
and
,
as
if
he
had
said
,
'
I
wish
them
no
worse
luck
*NL*
than
always
to
be
rolling
about
.
'
--
So
much
motion
,
continues
he
-LRB-
for
he
*NL*
was
very
corpulent
-RRB-
--
is
so
much
unquietness
;
and
so
much
of
rest
,
by
the
*NL*
same
analogy
,
is
so
much
of
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
I
-LRB-
being
very
thin
-RRB-
think
differently
;
and
that
so
much
of
motion
,
*NL*
is
so
much
of
life
,
and
so
much
of
joy
--
and
that
to
stand
still
,
or
get
*NL*
on
but
slowly
,
is
death
and
the
devil
--
*NL*
*NL*
Hollo

Ho
!
--
the
whole
world
's
asleep

--
bring
out
the
horses
--
grease
the
*NL*
wheels
--
tie
on
the
mail

and
drive
a
nail
into
that
moulding

'll
not

lose
a

Now
the
wheel
we
are
talking

that
would
make
an
Ixion

of
it
-RRB-
he
curseth
his
enemies
,
*NL*
according
to
the
bishop
's
habit
of
body
,
should
certainly
be
a
*NL*
post-chaise
wheel
,
whether
they
were
set
up
in
Palestine
at
that
time
*NL*
or
not
--
and
my
wheel
,
for
the
contrary
reasons
,
must
as
certainly
be
a
*NL*
cart-wheel
groaning
round
its
revolution
once
in
an
age
;
and
of
which
*NL*
sort
,
were
I
to
turn
commentator
,
I
should
make
no
scruple
to
affirm
,
*NL*
they
had
great
store
in
that
hilly
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
love
the
Pythagoreans
-LRB-
much
more
than
ever
I
dare
tell
my
dear
Jenny
-RRB-
*NL*
for
their

-LRB-
Greek
-RRB-

--

their
-RRB-
`

in

to

*NL*
well

'
No
man
thinks
right
,
whilst
he
is
in
it
;
blinded
as
he
must
be
,
*NL*
with
his
congenial
humours
,
and
drawn
differently
aside
,
as
the
bishop
*NL*
and
myself
have
been
,
with
too
lax
or
too
tense
a
fibre
--
Reason
is

half
*NL*
of
it

Sense

and
the
measure
of
heaven
itself
is
but
the
measure
of
our
*NL*
present
appetites
and
concoctions
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
which
of
the
two
,
in
the
present
case
,
do
you
think
to
be
mostly
*NL*
in
the
wrong

she
did
not

I
was
under

not
to
shave
my
beard
till
I
*NL*
got
to
Paris
;
--
yet
I
hate
to
make
mysteries
of
nothing
;
--
't
is
the
cold
*NL*
cautiousness
of
one
of
those
little
souls
from
which
Lessius
-LRB-
lib
.
13
.
*NL*
de
moribus
divinis
,
cap
.
24
.
-RRB-
hath
made
his
estimate
,
wherein
he
setteth
*NL*
forth
,
That
one
Dutch
mile
,
cubically
multiplied
,
will
allow
room
*NL*
enough
,
and
to
spare
,
for
eight
hundred
thousand
millions
,
which
he
*NL*
supposes
to
be
as
great
a
number
of
souls
-LRB-
counting
from
the
fall
of
*NL*
Adam
-RRB-
as
can
possibly
be
damn
'd
to
the
end
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
what
he
has
made
this
second
estimate
--
unless
from
the
parental
*NL*
goodness
of
God
--
I
do
n't
know
--
I
am
much
more
at
a
loss
what
could
be
in
*NL*
Franciscus
Ribbera
's
head
,
who
pretends
that
no
less
a
space
than
one
of
*NL*
two
hundred
Italian
miles
multiplied
into
itself
,
will
be
sufficient
to
*NL*
hold
the
like
number
--
he
certainly
must
have
gone
upon
some
of
the
old
*NL*
Roman
souls
,
of
which
he
had
read
,
without
reflecting
how
much
,
by
a
*NL*
gradual
and
most
tabid
decline
,
in
the
course
of
eighteen
hundred
years
,
*NL*
they
must
unavoidably
have
shrunk
so
as
to
have
come
,
when
he
wrote
,
*NL*
almost
to
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Lessius
's
time
,
who
seems
the
cooler
man
,
they
were
as
little
as
can
*NL*
be
imagined
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
We
find
them
less
now

*NL*
*NL*
And
next
winter
we
shall
find
them
less
again
;
so
that
if
we
go
on
from
*NL*
little
to
less
,
and
from
less
to
nothing
,
I
hesitate
not
one
moment
to

So
hating
,
I
say
,
to
make
mysteries
of
nothing
'
--
I
intrusted
it
with
*NL*
the
post-boy
,
as
soon
as
ever
I
got
off
the
stones
;
he
gave
a
crack
with
*NL*
his
whip
to
balance
the
compliment
;
and
with
the
thill-horse
trotting
,
*NL*
and
a
sort
of
an
up
and
a
down
of
the
other
,
we
danced
it
along
to
Ailly
*NL*
au
clochers
,
famed
in
days
of
yore
for
the
finest
chimes
in
the
world
;
*NL*
but
we
danced
through
it
without
music
--
the
chimes
being
greatly
out
of
*NL*
order
--
-LRB-
as
in

they
were
through

so
making

from

Ailly

I
got
to
Hixcourt

from
Hixcourt
I
got

Pequignay

from

I
got
to
Amiens

concerning

I

nothing

In
the
whole
catalogue
of
those
whiffling
vexations
which
come
*NL*
puffing
across
a

's

,
there
is
not
one
of
a
more
teasing
*NL*

tormenting
nature
,
than
this
particular
one
which
I
am
going
to
*NL*
describe
--
and
for
which
-LRB-
unless
you
travel
with
an
avance-courier
,
which
*NL*
numbers
do
in
order
to
prevent
it
-RRB-
--
there
is
no
help
:
and
it
is
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
be
you
in
never
so
kindly
a
propensity
to
sleep
--
though
you
are
*NL*
passing
perhaps
through
the
finest
country
--
upon
the
best
roads
,
and
in
*NL*
the
easiest
carriage
for
doing
it
in
the
world
--
nay
,
was
you
sure
you
*NL*
could
sleep
fifty
miles
straight
forwards
,
without
once
opening
your
*NL*
eyes
--
nay
,
what
is
more
,
was
you
as
demonstratively
satisfied
as
you
can
*NL*
be
of
any
truth
in
Euclid
,
that
you
should
upon
all
accounts
be
full
as
*NL*
well
asleep
as
awake
--
nay
,
perhaps
better
--
Yet
the
incessant
returns
of
*NL*
paying
for
the
horses
at
every
stage
,
--
with
the
necessity
thereupon
of
*NL*
putting
your
hand
into
your
pocket
,
and
counting
out
from
thence
three
*NL*
livres
fifteen
sous
-LRB-
sous
by
sous
-RRB-
,
puts
an
end
to
so
much
of
the
*NL*
project
,
that
you
can
not
execute
above
six
miles
of
it
-LRB-
or
supposing
it
*NL*
is
a
post
and
a
half
,
that
is
but
nine
-RRB-
--
were
it
to
save
your
soul
from
*NL*
destruction
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
be
even
with
'em
,
quoth
I
,
for
I
'll
put
the
precise
sum
into
a
*NL*
piece
of
paper
,
and
hold
it
ready
in
my
hand
all
the
way
:
`
Now
I
shall
*NL*
have
nothing
to
do
,
'
said
I
-LRB-
composing
myself
to
rest
-RRB-
,
`
but
to
drop
*NL*
this
gently
into
the
post-boy
's
hat
,
and
not
say
a
word
.
'
--
Then
there
*NL*
wants
two
sous
more
to
drink
--
or
there
is
a
twelve
sous
piece
of
Louis
*NL*
XIV
.
which
will
not
pass
--
or
a
livre
and
some
odd
liards
to
be
brought
*NL*
over
from
the
last
stage
,
which
Monsieur
had
forgot
;
which
altercations
*NL*
-LRB-
as
a
man
can
not
dispute
very
well
asleep
-RRB-
rouse
him
:
still
is
sweet
*NL*
sleep
retrievable
;
and
still
might
the
flesh
weigh
down
the
spirit
,
and
*NL*
recover
itself
of
these
blows
--
but
then
,
by
heaven
!
you
have
paid
but
*NL*
for
a
single
post
--
whereas
't
is
a
post
and
a
half
;
and
this
obliges
*NL*
you
to
pull
out
your
book
of
post-roads
,
the
print
of
which
is
so
very
*NL*
small
,
it
forces
you
to
open
your
eyes
,
whether
you
will
or
no
:
Then
*NL*
Monsieur
le
Cure
offers
you
a
pinch
of
snuff
--
or
a
poor
soldier
shews
*NL*
you
his
leg
--
or
a
shaveling
his
box
--
or
the
priestesse
of
the
cistern
*NL*
will
water
your
wheels
--
they
do
not
want
it
--
but
she
swears
by
her
*NL*
priesthood
-LRB-
throwing
it
back
-RRB-
that
they
do
:
--
then
you
have
all
these
*NL*
points
to
argue
,
or
consider
over
in
your
mind
;
in
doing
of
which
,
the
*NL*
rational
powers
get
so
thoroughly
awakened
--
you
may
get
'em
to
sleep
*NL*
again
as
you
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
entirely
owing
to
one
of
these
misfortunes
,
or
I
had
pass
'd
clean
*NL*
by
the
stables
of
Chantilly
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
the
postillion
first
affirming
,
and
then
persisting
in
it
to
my
*NL*
face
,
that
there
was
no
mark
upon
the
two
sous
piece
,
I
open
'd
my
eyes
*NL*
to
be
convinced
--
and
seeing
the
mark
upon
it
as
plain
as
my
nose
--
I
*NL*
leap
'd
out
of
the
chaise
in
a
passion
,
and
so
saw
every
thing
at
*NL*
Chantilly
in
spite
.
--
I
tried
it
but
for
three
posts
and
a
half
,
but
*NL*
believe
't
is
the
best
principle
in
the
world
to
travel
speedily
upon
;
*NL*
for
as
few
objects
look
very
inviting
in
that
mood
--
you
have
little
or
*NL*
nothing
to
stop
you
;
by
which
means
it
was
that
I
passed
through
St.
*NL*
Dennis
,
without
turning
my
head
so
much
as
on
one
side
towards
the
*NL*
Abby
--
*NL*
*NL*

Richness
of
their
treasury

stuff

bating
their

*NL*
which
are
all
false
,
I
would
not
give
three
sous
for
any
one
thing
in
*NL*
it
,
but
Jaidas
's
lantern
--
nor
for
that
either
,
only
as
it
grows
dark

it
*NL*
might
be
of

we

The

are
certainly
misunderstood

whether
the

theirs

in
not
sufficiently
explaining
themselves

speaking
with
that

exact
limitation

precision

which
,

is

not
*NL*
understanding

always
so
critically
as

know
`

I

I
have
said

there
was

depending

I
repeat
it
again

not
because
the

sharp

confounded

that
there
is
neither

that
's
not

it
is

uncertain

up

the
five
hundred
good

at
a

modest
computation
-LRB-
for
't
is
only
allowing
one
good

by

In
mentioning
the

gay
-LRB-
as
in
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
-RRB-
it
puts
*NL*
one
-LRB-
i.e.
an
author
-RRB-
in
mind
of
the
word
spleen
--
especially
if
he
has
*NL*
any
thing
to
say
upon
it
:
not
that
by
any
analysis
--
or
that
from
any
*NL*
table
of
interest
or
genealogy
,
there
appears
much
more
ground
of
*NL*
alliance
betwixt
them
,
than
betwixt
light
and
darkness
,
or
any
two
of
*NL*
the
most
unfriendly
opposites
in
nature
--
only
't
is
an
undercraft
of
*NL*
authors
to
keep
up
a
good
understanding
amongst
words
,
as
politicians
*NL*
do
amongst
men
--
not
knowing
how
near
they
may
be
under
a
necessity
of
*NL*
placing
them
to
each
other
--
which
point
being
now
gain
'd
,
and
that
I
may
*NL*
place
mine
exactly
to
my
mind
,
I
write
it
down
here
--
*NL*
*NL*
Spleen
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
upon
leaving
Chantilly
,
I
declared
to
be
the
best
principle
in
the
*NL*
world
to
travel
speedily
upon
;
but
I
gave
it
only
as
matter
of
opinion
.
*NL*
I
still
continue
in
the
same
sentiments
--
only
I
had
not
then
experience
*NL*
enough
of
its
working
to
add
this
,
that
though
you
do
get
on
at
a
*NL*
tearing
rate
,
yet
you
get
on
but
uneasily
to
yourself
at
the
same
*NL*
time
;
for
which
reason
I
here
quit
it
entirely
,
and
for
ever
,
and
't
is
*NL*
heartily
at
any
one
's
service
--
it
has
spoiled
me
the
digestion
of
a
good
*NL*
supper
,
and
brought
on
a
bilious
diarrhoea
,
which
has
brought
me
back
*NL*
again
to
my
first
principle
on
which
I
set
out
--
and
with
which
I
shall
*NL*
now
scamper
it
away
to
the
banks
of
the
Garonne
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
No

I
can
not

A
Dedication
to
a
Great
Man

*NL*
*NL*
Having
,
a
priori
,
intended
to
dedicate
The
Amours
of
my
Uncle
Toby
to
*NL*
Mr.
...
--
I
see
more
reasons
,
a
posteriori
,
for
doing
it
to
Lord
...
...
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
lament
from
my
soul
,
if
this
exposed
me
to
the
jealousy
of
*NL*
their
Reverences
;
because
a
posteriori
,
in
Court-latin
,
signifies
the
*NL*
kissing
hands
for
preferment
--
or
any
thing
else
--
in
order
to
get
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
opinion
of
Lord
...
.
.
is
neither
better
nor
worse
,
than
it
was
of
*NL*
Mr.
...
Honours
,
like
impressions
upon
coin
,
may
give
an
ideal
and
*NL*
local
value
to
a
bit
of
base
metal
;
but
Gold
and
Silver
will
pass
all
*NL*
the
world
over
without
any
other
recommendation
than
their
own
weight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
good-will
that
made
me
think
of
offering
up
half
an
hour
's
*NL*
amusement
to
Mr.
...
when
out
of
place
--
operates
more
forcibly
at
*NL*
present
,
as
half
an
hour
's
amusement
will
be
more
serviceable
and
*NL*
refreshing
after
labour
and
sorrow
,
than
after
a
philosophical
repast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
so
perfectly
amusement
as
a
total
change
of
ideas
;
no
ideas
*NL*
are
so
totally
different
as
those
of
Ministers
,
and
innocent
Lovers
:
*NL*
for
which
reason
,
when
I
come
to
talk
of
Statesmen
and
Patriots
,
and
set
*NL*
such
marks
upon
them
as
will
prevent
confusion
and
mistakes
concerning
*NL*
them
for
the
future
--
I
propose
to
dedicate
that
Volume
to
some
gentle
*NL*
Shepherd
,
*NL*
*NL*
Whose
thoughts
proud
Science
never
taught
to
stray
,
*NL*
Far
as
the
Statesman
's
walk
or
Patriot-way
;
*NL*
Yet
simple
Nature
to
his
hopes
had
given
*NL*
Out
of
a
cloud-capp
'd
head
a
humbler
heaven
;
*NL*
Some
untam
'd
World
in
depths
of
wood
embraced
--
*NL*
Some
happier
Island
in
the
wat
`
ry-waste
--
*NL*
And
where
admitted
to
that
equal
sky
,
*NL*
His
faithful
Dogs
should
bear
him
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
word
,
by
thus
introducing
an
entire
new
set
of
objects
to
his
*NL*
Imagination
,
I
shall
unavoidably
give
a
Diversion
to
his
passionate
and
*NL*
love-sick
Contemplations

I
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
hate
to
hear
a
person
,
especially
if
he
be
a
traveller
,
complain
*NL*
that
we
do
not
get
on
so
fast
in
France
as
we
do
in
England
;
whereas
we
*NL*
get
on
much
faster
,
consideratis
considerandis
;
thereby
always
meaning
,
*NL*
that
if
you
weigh
their
vehicles
with
the
mountains
of
baggage
which
*NL*
you
lay
both
before
and
behind
upon
them
--
and
then
consider
their
puny
*NL*
horses
,
with
the
very
little
they
give
them
--
't
is
a
wonder
they
get
on
*NL*
at
all
:
their
suffering
is
most
unchristian
,
and
't
is
evident
thereupon
*NL*
to
me
,
that
a
French
post-horse
would
not
know
what
in
the
world
to
do
,
*NL*
was
it
not
for
the
two
words
...
.
and
...
.
in
which
there
is
as
much
*NL*
sustenance
,
as
if
you
give
him
a
peck
of
corn
:
now
as
these
words
cost
*NL*
nothing
,
I
long
from
my
soul
to
tell
the
reader
what
they
are
;
but
*NL*
here
is
the
question
--
they
must
be
told
him
plainly
,
and
with
the
most
*NL*
distinct
articulation
,
or
it
will
answer
no
end
--
and
yet
to
do
it
*NL*
in
that
plain
way
--
though
their
reverences
may
laugh
at
it
in
the
*NL*
bed-chamber
--
full
well
I
wot
,
they
will
abuse
it
in
the
parlour
:
for
*NL*
which
cause
,
I
have
been
volving
and
revolving
in
my
fancy
some
time
,
*NL*
but
to
no
purpose
,
by
what
clean
device
or
facette
contrivance
I
might
*NL*
so
modulate
them
,
that
whilst
I
satisfy
that
ear
which
the
reader
chuses
*NL*
to
lend
me
--
I
might
not
dissatisfy
the
other
which
he
keeps
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
ink
burns
my
finger
to
try
--
and
when
I
have
--
`
twill
have
a
worse

consequence
--
It
will
burn

fear

my

if
you
wish
to
know
how
the
abbess
of
Andouillets
and
a
novice
*NL*
of
her
convent
got
over
the
difficulty
-LRB-
only
first
wishing
myself
all

success

*NL*
*NL*
The
abbess
of
Andouillets
,
which
if
you
look
into
the
large
set
of
*NL*
provincial
maps
now
publishing
at
Paris
,
you
will
find
situated
amongst
*NL*
the
hills
which
divide
Burgundy
from
Savoy
,
being
in
danger
of
an
*NL*
Anchylosis
or
stiff
joint
-LRB-
the
sinovia
of
her
knee
becoming
hard
by
long
*NL*
matins
-RRB-
,
and
having
tried
every
remedy
--
first
,
prayers
and
thanksgiving
;
*NL*
then
invocations
to
all
the
saints
in
heaven
promiscuously
--
then
*NL*
particularly
to
every
saint
who
had
ever
had
a
stiff
leg
before
*NL*
her
--
then
touching
it
with
all
the
reliques
of
the
convent
,
principally
*NL*
with
the
thigh-bone
of
the
man
of
Lystra
,
who
had
been
impotent
from
*NL*
his
youth
--
then
wrapping
it
up
in
her
veil
when
she
went
to
bed
--
then
*NL*
cross-wise
her
rosary
--
then
bringing
in
to
her
aid
the
secular
arm
,
and
*NL*
anointing
it
with
oils
and
hot
fat
of
animals
--
then
treating
it
*NL*
with
emollient
and
resolving
fomentations
--
then
with
poultices
*NL*
of
marsh-mallows
,
mallows
,
bonus
Henricus
,
white
lillies
and
*NL*
fenugreek
--
then
taking
the
woods
,
I
mean
the
smoak
of
'em
,
holding
*NL*
her
scapulary
across
her
lap
--
then
decoctions
of
wild
chicory
,
*NL*
water-cresses
,
chervil
,
sweet
cecily
and
cochlearia
--
and
nothing
all
*NL*
this
while
answering
,
was
prevailed
on
at
last
to
try
the
hot-baths
of
*NL*
Bourbon
--
so
having
first
obtained
leave
of
the
visitor-general
to
take
*NL*
care
of
her
existence
--
she
ordered
all
to
be
got
ready
for
her
journey
:
*NL*
a
novice
of
the
convent
of
about
seventeen
,
who
had
been
troubled
with
*NL*
a
whitloe
in
her
middle
finger
,
by
sticking
it
constantly
into
the
*NL*
abbess
's
cast
poultices
,
&
c.
--
had
gained
such
an
interest
,
that
*NL*
overlooking
a
sciatical
old
nun
,
who
might
have
been
set
up
for
ever
by
*NL*
the
hot-baths
of
Bourbon
,
Margarita
,
the
little
novice
,
was
elected
as
*NL*
the
companion
of
the
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
calesh
,
belonging
to
the
abbesse
,
lined
with
green
frize
,
was
*NL*
ordered
to
be
drawn
out
into
the
sun
--
the
gardener
of
the
convent
being
*NL*
chosen
muleteer
,
led
out
the
two
old
mules
,
to
clip
the
hair
from
the
*NL*
rump-ends
of
their
tails
,
whilst
a
couple
of
lay-sisters
were
busied
,
*NL*
the
one
in
darning
the
lining
,
and
the
other
in
sewing
on
the
shreds
*NL*
of
yellow
binding
,
which
the
teeth
of
time
had
unravelled
--
the
*NL*
under-gardener
dress
'd
the
muleteer
's
hat
in
hot
wine-lees
--
and
a
taylor
*NL*
sat
musically
at
it
,
in
a
shed
over-against
the
convent
,
in
assorting
*NL*
four
dozen
of
bells
for
the
harness
,
whistling
to
each
bell
,
as
he
tied
*NL*
it
on
with
a
thong
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
carpenter
and
the
smith
of
Andouillets
held
a
council
of
wheels
;
*NL*
and
by
seven
,
the
morning
after
,
all
look
'd
spruce
,
and
was
ready
at
*NL*
the
gate
of
the
convent
for
the
hot-baths
of
Bourbon
--
two
rows
of
the
*NL*
unfortunate
stood
ready
there
an
hour
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abbess
of
Andouillets
,
supported
by
Margarita
the
novice
,
advanced
*NL*
slowly
to
the
calesh
,
both
clad
in
white
,
with
their
black
rosaries
*NL*
hanging
at
their
breasts
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
was
a
simple
solemnity
in
the
contrast
:
they
entered
the
calesh
;
*NL*
the
nuns
in
the
same
uniform
,
sweet
emblem
of
innocence
,
each
occupied
*NL*
a
window
,
and
as
the
abbess
and
Margarita
look
'd
up
--
each
-LRB-
the
sciatical
*NL*
poor
nun
excepted
-RRB-
--
each
stream
'd
out
the
end
of
her
veil
in
the
*NL*
air
--
then
kiss
'd
the
lilly
hand
which
let
it
go
:
the
good
abbess
and
*NL*
Margarita
laid
their
hands
saint-wise
upon
their
breasts
--
look
'd
up
to
*NL*
heaven
--
then
to
them
--
and
look
'd
`
God
bless
you
,
dear
sisters
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
declare
I
am
interested
in
this
story
,
and
wish
I
had
been
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gardener
,
whom
I
shall
now
call
the
muleteer
,
was
a
little
,
hearty
,
*NL*
broad-set
,
good-natured
,
chattering
,
toping
kind
of
a
fellow
,
who
*NL*
troubled
his
head
very
little
with
the
hows
and
whens
of
life
;
so
had
*NL*
mortgaged
a
month
of
his
conventical
wages
in
a
borrachio
,
or
leathern
*NL*
cask
of
wine
,
which
he
had
disposed
behind
the
calesh
,
with
a
large
*NL*
russet-coloured
riding-coat
over
it
,
to
guard
it
from
the
sun
;
and
as
*NL*
the
weather
was
hot
,
and
he
not
a
niggard
of
his
labours
,
walking
ten
*NL*
times
more
than
he
rode
--
he
found
more
occasions
than
those
of
nature
,
*NL*
to
fall
back
to
the
rear
of
his
carriage
;
till
by
frequent
coming
and
*NL*
going
,
it
had
so
happen
'd
,
that
all
his
wine
had
leak
'd
out
at
the
legal
*NL*
vent
of
the
borrachio
,
before
one
half
of
the
journey
was
finish
'd

*NL*
evening
was
delicious
--
the
wine
was
generous
--
the
Burgundian
hill
on
*NL*
which
it
grew
was
steep
--
a
little
tempting
bush
over
the
door
of
a
*NL*
cool
cottage
at
the
foot
of
it
,
hung
vibrating
in
full
harmony
with
*NL*
the
passions
--
a
gentle
air
rustled
distinctly
through
the
*NL*
leaves
--
`
Come
--
come
,
thirsty
muleteer
,
--
come

'
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
muleteer
was
a
son
of
Adam
,
I
need
not
say
a
word
more
.
He
gave
*NL*
the
mules
,
each
of
'em
,
a
sound
lash
,
and
looking
in
the
abbess
's
and
*NL*
Margarita
's
faces
-LRB-
as
he
did
it
-RRB-
--
as
much
as
to
say
`
here
I
am
'
--
he
*NL*
gave
a
second
good
crack
--
as
much
as
to
say
to
his
mules
,
`
get
on
'
--
so
*NL*
slinking
behind
,
he
enter
'd
the
little
inn
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
muleteer
,
as
I
told
you
,
was
a
little
,
joyous
,
chirping
fellow
,
who
*NL*
thought
not
of
to-morrow
,
nor
of
what
had
gone
before
,
or
what
was
to
*NL*
follow
it
,
provided
he
got
but
his
scantling
of
Burgundy
,
and
a
little
*NL*
chit-chat
along
with
it
;
so
entering
into
a
long
conversation
,
as
how
*NL*
he
was
chief
gardener
to
the
convent
of
Andouillets
,
&
c.
&
c.
and
out
of
*NL*
friendship
for
the
abbess
and
Mademoiselle
Margarita
,
who
was
only
in
*NL*
her
noviciate
,
he
had
come
along
with
them
from
the
confines
of
Savoy
,
*NL*
&
c.
&
c.
--
and
as
how
she
had
got
a
white
swelling
by
her
devotions
--
and
*NL*
what
a
nation
of
herbs
he
had
procured
to
mollify
her
humours
,
&
c.
&
c.
*NL*
and
that
if
the
waters
of
Bourbon
did
not
mend
that
leg
--
she
might
*NL*
as
well
be
lame
of
both
--
&
c.
&
c.
&
c.
--
He
so
contrived
his
story
,
as
*NL*
absolutely
to
forget
the
heroine
of
it
--
and
with
her
the
little
novice
,
*NL*
and
what
was
a
more
ticklish
point
to
be
forgot
than
both
--
the
two
*NL*
mules
;
who
being
creatures
that
take
advantage
of
the
world
,
inasmuch
*NL*
as
their
parents
took
it
of
them
--
and
they
not
being
in
a
condition
to
*NL*
return
the
obligation
downwards
-LRB-
as
men
and
women
and
beasts
are
-RRB-
--
they
*NL*
do
it
side-ways
,
and
long-ways
,
and
back-ways
--
and
up
hill
,
and
down
*NL*
hill
,
and
which
way
they
can
.
--
Philosophers
,
with
all
their
ethicks
,
*NL*
have
never
considered
this
rightly
--
how
should
the
poor
muleteer
,
then
*NL*
in
his
cups
,
consider
it
at
all
?
he
did
not
in
the
least
--
't
is
time
we
*NL*
do
;
let
us
leave
him
then
in
the
vortex
of
his
element
,
the
happiest
and
*NL*
most
thoughtless
of
mortal
men
--
and
for
a
moment
let
us
look
after
the
*NL*
mules
,
the
abbess
,
and
Margarita
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
virtue
of
the
muleteer
's
two
last
strokes
the
mules
had
gone
quietly
*NL*
on
,
following
their
own
consciences
up
the
hill
,
till
they
had
conquer
'd
*NL*
about
one
half
of
it
;
when
the
elder
of
them
,
a
shrewd
crafty
old
devil
,
*NL*
at
the
turn
of
an
angle
,
giving
a
side
glance
,
and
no
muleteer
behind
*NL*
them
,
--

By

said
she
,
swearing
,
I
'll
go
no
further
--
And
if
I
do

replied
*NL*
the
other
,
they
shall
make
a

My

quoth
the
novice
,
coming
a
little
to
herself
,
--
there
are
*NL*
two
certain
words
,
which
I
have
been
told
will
force
any
horse
,
or
ass
,
*NL*
or
mule
,
to
go
up
a

whether
he
will
or
no
;
be
he
never
so
obstinate
*NL*
or
ill-will
'd
,
the
moment
he
hears
them
utter
'd
,
he
obeys
.
They
*NL*
are
words
magic
!
cried
the
abbess
in
the
utmost
horror
--
No
;
replied
*NL*
Margarita
calmly
--
but
they
are
words
sinful
--
What
are
they
?
quoth
the
*NL*
abbess
,
interrupting
her
:
They
are
sinful
in
the
first
degree
,
answered
*NL*
Margarita
,
--
they
are
mortal
--
and
if
we
are
ravished
and
die
unabsolved
*NL*
of
them
,
we
shall
both-but
you
may
pronounce
them
to
me
,
quoth
the
*NL*
abbess
of
Andouillets
--
They
can
not

my
dear
mother

said
the
novice
,
*NL*

pronounced

they
will
make
all

But

*NL*
Heaven

hadst
thou
no

was
there
no

*NL*
unemployed

no

in

by
some
monitory
shivering
,
creeping
*NL*
along
the
artery
which
led
to
his

to
rouse
the
muleteer

All

whatever

quoth
the
abbess
,
turning
casuist
in
the
distress
*NL*
they
were
under
,
are
held
by
the
confessor
of
our
convent
to
be
either
*NL*
mortal
or
venial
:
there
is
no
further
division
.
Now
a
venial
sin
being
*NL*
the
slightest
and
least
of
all
sins
--
being
halved
--
by
taking
either
only
*NL*
the
half
of
it
,
and
leaving
the
rest
--
or
,
by
taking
it
all
,
and
amicably
*NL*
halving
it
betwixt
yourself
and
another
person
--
in
course
becomes
*NL*
diluted
into
no
sin
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
see
no
sin
in
saying

bou

a

continued
the
abbess
of
Andouillets
--
I
will
say
bou

*NL*

thou

then
alternately

there
is
no

one
says
of
it
the
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
Auxerre
--
I
could
go
on
for
ever
:
for
in
my
grand
tour
through
*NL*
Europe
,
in
which
,
after
all
,
my
father
-LRB-
not
caring
to
trust
me
with
any
*NL*
one
-RRB-
attended
me
himself
,
with
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
Trim
,
and
Obadiah
,
and
*NL*
indeed
most
of
the
family
,
except
my
mother
,
who
being
taken
up
with
*NL*
a
project
of
knitting
my
father
a
pair
of
large
worsted
breeches
--
-LRB-
the
*NL*
thing
is
common
sense
-RRB-
--
and
she
not
caring
to
be
put
out
of
her
way
,
*NL*
she
staid
at
home
,
at
Shandy
Hall
,
to
keep
things
right
during
the
*NL*
expedition
;
in
which
,
I
say
,
my
father
stopping
us
two
days
at
Auxerre
,
*NL*
and
his
researches
being
ever
of
such
a
nature
,
that
they
would
have
*NL*
found
fruit
even
in
a
desert
--
he
has
left
me
enough
to
say
upon
Auxerre
:
*NL*
in
short
,
wherever
my
father
went
--
but
't
was
more
remarkably
so
,
in
*NL*
this
journey
through
France
and
Italy
,
than
in
any
other
stages
of
his
*NL*
life
--
his
road
seemed
to
lie
so
much
on
one
side
of
that
,
wherein
all
*NL*
other
travellers
have
gone
before
him
--
he
saw
kings
and
courts
and
silks
*NL*
of
all
colours
,
in
such
strange
lights
--
and
his
remarks
and
reasonings
*NL*
upon
the
characters
,
the
manners
,
and
customs
of
the
countries
we
pass
'd
*NL*
over
,
were
so
opposite
to
those
of
all
other
mortal
men
,
particularly
*NL*
those
of
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
--
-LRB-
to
say
nothing
of
myself
-RRB-
--
and
to
*NL*
crown
all
--
the
occurrences
and
scrapes
which
we
were
perpetually
meeting
*NL*
and
getting
into
,
in
consequence
of
his
systems
and
opiniotry
--
they
were
*NL*
of
so
odd
,
so
mix
'd
and
tragi-comical
a
contexture
--
That
the
whole
put
*NL*
together
,
it
appears
of
so
different
a
shade
and
tint
from
any
tour
of
*NL*
Europe
,
which
was
ever
executed
--
that
I
will
venture
to
pronounce
--
the
*NL*
fault
must
be
mine
and
mine
only
--
if
it
be
not
read
by
all
travellers
*NL*
and
travel-readers
,
till
travelling
is
no
more
,
--
or
which
comes
to
the
*NL*
same
point
--
till
the
world
,
finally
,
takes
it
into
its
head
to
stand
*NL*
still
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
this
rich
bale
is
not
to
be
open
'd
now
;
except
a
small
thread
or
*NL*
two
of
it
,
merely
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
my
father
's
stay
at
Auxerre
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
As
I
have
mentioned
it
--
't
is
too
slight
to
be
kept
suspended
;
and
when
*NL*
't
is
wove
in
,
there
is
an
end
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
'll
go
,
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
whilst
dinner
is
coddling
--
to
*NL*
the
abbey
of
Saint
Germain
,
if
it
be
only
to
see
these
bodies
,
of
which
*NL*
Monsieur
Sequier
has
given
such
a
recommendation
.
--
I
'll
go
see
any
body
,
*NL*
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
;
for
he
was
all
compliance
through
every
step
of
the
*NL*
journey
--
Defend
me
!
said
my
father
--
they
are
all
mummies
--
Then
one
need
*NL*
not
shave
;
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
--
Shave
!
no
--
cried
my
father
--
`
twill
be
*NL*
more
like
relations
to
go
with
our
beards
on
--
So
out
we
sallied
,
the
*NL*
corporal
lending
his
master
his
arm
,
and
bringing
up
the
rear
,
to
the
*NL*
abbey
of
Saint
Germain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
thing
is
very
fine
,
and
very
rich
,
and
very
superb
,
and
very
*NL*
magnificent
,
said
my
father
,
addressing
himself
to
the
sacristan
,
who
*NL*
was
a
younger
brother
of
the
order
of
Benedictines
--
but
our
curiosity
*NL*
has
led
us
to
see
the
bodies
,
of
which
Monsieur
Sequier
has
given
the
*NL*
world
so
exact
a
description
.
--
The
sacristan
made
a
bow
,
and
lighting
a
*NL*
torch
first
,
which
he
had
always
in
the
vestry
ready
for
the
purpose
;
he
*NL*
led
us
into
the
tomb
of
St.
Heribald
--
This
,
said
the
sacristan
,
laying
*NL*
his
hand
upon
the
tomb
,
was
a
renowned
prince
of
the
house
of
Bavaria
,
*NL*
who
under
the
successive
reigns
of
Charlemagne
,
Louis
le
Debonnair
,
*NL*
and
Charles
the
Bald
,
bore
a
great
sway
in
the
government
,
and
had
a
*NL*
principal
hand
in
bringing
every
thing
into
order
and
discipline
--
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
has
been
as
great
,
said
my
uncle
,
in
the
field
,
as
in
the
*NL*
cabinet
--
I
dare
say
he
has
been
a
gallant
soldier
--
He
was
a
monk
--
said
*NL*
the
sacristan
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
sought
comfort
in
each
other
's
faces
--
but
found
*NL*
it
not
:
my
father
clapped
both
his
hands
upon
his
cod-piece
,
which
was
a
*NL*
way
he
had
when
any
thing
hugely
tickled
him
:
for
though
he
hated
a
monk
*NL*
and
the
very
smell
of
a
monk
worse
than
all
the
devils
in
hell
--
yet
the
*NL*
shot
hitting
my
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
so
much
harder
than
him
,
't
was
a
*NL*
relative
triumph
;
and
put
him
into
the
gayest
humour
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
pray
what
do
you
call
this
gentleman
?
quoth
my
father
,
rather
*NL*
sportingly
:
This
tomb
,
said
the
young
Benedictine
,
looking
downwards
,
*NL*
contains
the
bones
of
Saint
Maxima
,
who
came
from
Ravenna
on
purpose
to
*NL*
touch
the
body
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Of
Saint
Maximus
,
said
my
father
,
popping
in
with
his
saint
before
*NL*
him
,
--
they
were
two
of
the
greatest
saints
in
the
whole
martyrology
,
*NL*
added
my
father
--
Excuse
me
,
said
the
sacristan
--
't
was
to
touch
the
bones
*NL*
of
Saint
Germain
,
the
builder
of
the
abbey
--
And
what
did
she
get
by
*NL*
it
?
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
What
does
any
woman
get
by
it
?
said
my
*NL*
father
--
Martyrdome
;
replied
the
young
Benedictine
,
making
a
bow
down
*NL*
to
the
ground
,
and
uttering
the
word
with
so
humble
,
but
decisive
a
*NL*
cadence
,
it
disarmed
my
father
for
a
moment
.
'T
is
supposed
,
continued
*NL*
the
Benedictine
,
that
St.
Maxima
has
lain
in
this
tomb
four
hundred
*NL*
years
,
and
two
hundred
before
her
canonization
--
'T
is
but
a
slow
rise
,
*NL*
brother
Toby
,
quoth
my
father
,
in
this
self-same
army
of
martyrs
.
--
A
*NL*
desperate
slow
one
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
said
Trim
,
unless
one
could
*NL*
purchase
--
I
should
rather
sell
out
entirely
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
--
I
am
*NL*
pretty
much
of
your
opinion
,
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Poor
St.
Maxima
!
said
my
uncle
Toby
low
to
himself
,
as
we
turn
'd
from
*NL*
her
tomb
:
She
was
one
of
the
fairest
and
most
beautiful
ladies
either
of
*NL*
Italy
or
France
,
continued
the
sacristan
--
But
who
the
duce
has
got
lain
*NL*
down
here
,
besides
her
?
quoth
my
father
,
pointing
with
his
cane
to
*NL*
a
large
tomb
as
we
walked
on
--
It
is
Saint
Optat
,
Sir
,
answered
the
*NL*
sacristan
--
And
properly
is
Saint
Optat
plac
'd
!
said
my
father
:
And
*NL*
what
is
Saint
Optat
's
story
?
continued
he
.
Saint
Optat
,
replied
the
*NL*
sacristan
,
was
a
bishop
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
thought
so
,
by
heaven
!
cried
my
father
,
interrupting
him
--
Saint
*NL*
Optat
!
--
how
should
Saint
Optat
fail
?
so
snatching
out
his
pocket-book
,
*NL*
and
the
young
Benedictine
holding
him
the
torch
as
he
wrote
,
he
set
it
*NL*
down
as
a
new
prop
to
his
system
of
Christian
names
,
and
I
will
be
bold
*NL*
to
say
,
so
disinterested
was
he
in
the
search
of
truth
,
that
had
he
*NL*
found
a
treasure
in
Saint
Optat
's
tomb
,
it
would
not
have
made
him
half
*NL*
so
rich
:
'T
was
as
successful
a
short
visit
as
ever
was
paid
to
the
*NL*
dead
;
and
so
highly
was
his
fancy
pleas
'd
with
all
that
had
passed
in
*NL*
it
,
--
that
he
determined
at
once
to
stay
another
day
in
Auxerre
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
see
the
rest
of
these
good
gentry
to-morrow
,
said
my
father
,
as
*NL*
we
cross
'd
over
the
square
--
And
while
you
are
paying
that
visit
,
brother
*NL*
Shandy
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
--
the
corporal
and
I
will
mount
the
ramparts

IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
this
is
the
most
puzzled
skein
of
all
--
for
in
this
last
chapter
,
*NL*
as
far
at
least
as
it
has
help
'd
me
through
Auxerre
,
I
have
been
getting
*NL*
forwards
in
two
different
journies
together
,
and
with
the
same
dash
of
*NL*
the
pen
--
for
I
have
got
entirely
out
of
Auxerre
in
this
journey
which
*NL*
I
am
writing
now
,
and
I
am
got
half
way
out
of
Auxerre
in
that
which
I
*NL*
shall
write
hereafter
--
There
is
but
a
certain
degree
of
perfection
in
*NL*
every
thing
;
and
by
pushing
at
something
beyond
that
,
I
have
brought
*NL*
myself
into
such
a
situation
,
as
no
traveller
ever
stood
before
me
;
*NL*
for
I
am
this
moment
walking
across
the
market-place
of
Auxerre
with
*NL*
my
father
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
our
way
back
to
dinner
--
and
I
am
this
*NL*
moment
also
entering
Lyons
with
my
post-chaise
broke
into
a
thousand
*NL*
pieces
--
and
I
am
moreover
this
moment
in
a
handsome
pavillion
built
by
*NL*
Pringello
-LRB-
The
same
Don
Pringello
,
the
celebrated
Spanish
architect
,
of
*NL*
whom
my
cousin
Antony
has
made
such
honourable
mention
in

.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
glad
of
it
,
said
I
,
settling
the
account
with
myself
,
as
I
walk
'd
*NL*
into
Lyons
--
my
chaise
being
all
laid
higgledy-piggledy
with
my
baggage
*NL*
in
a
cart
,
which
was
moving
slowly
before
me
--
I
am
heartily
glad
,
said
*NL*
I
,
that
't
is
all
broke
to
pieces
;
for
now
I
can
go
directly
by
water
*NL*
to
Avignon
,
which
will
carry
me
on
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
of
my
*NL*
journey
,
and
not
cost
me
seven
livres
--
and
from
thence
,
continued
I
,
*NL*
bringing
forwards
the
account
,
I
can
hire
a
couple
of
mules
--
or
asses
,
*NL*
if
I
like
,
-LRB-
for
nobody
knows
me
,
-RRB-
and
cross
the
plains
of
Languedoc
for
*NL*
almost
nothing
--
I
shall
gain
four
hundred
livres
by
the
misfortune
clear
*NL*
into
my
purse
:
and
pleasure
!
worth
--
worth
double
the
money
by
it
.
With
*NL*
what
velocity
,
continued
I
,
clapping
my
two
hands
together
,
shall
I
fly
*NL*
down
the
rapid
Rhone
,
with
the
Vivares
on
my
right
hand
,
and
Dauphiny
*NL*
on
my
left
,
scarce
seeing
the
ancient
cities
of
Vienne
,
Valence
,
*NL*
and
Vivieres
.
What
a
flame
will
it
rekindle
in
the
lamp
,
to
snatch
a
*NL*
blushing
grape
from
the
Hermitage
and
Cote
roti
,
as
I
shoot
by
the
foot
*NL*
of
them
!
and
what
a
fresh
spring
in
the
blood
!
to
behold
upon
the
banks
*NL*
advancing
and
retiring
,
the
castles
of
romance
,
whence
courteous
knights
*NL*
have
whilome
rescued
the
distress
'd
--
and
see
vertiginous
,
the
rocks
,
the
*NL*
mountains
,
the
cataracts
,
and
all
the
hurry
which
Nature
is
in
with
all
*NL*
her
great
works
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
went
on
thus
,
methought
my
chaise
,
the
wreck
of
which
look
'd
*NL*
stately
enough
at
the
first
,
insensibly
grew
less
and
less
in
its
*NL*
size
;
the
freshness
of
the
painting
was
no
more
--
the
gilding
lost
its
*NL*
lustre
--
and
the
whole
affair
appeared
so
poor
in
my
eyes
--
so
sorry
!
--
so
*NL*
contemptible
!
and
,
in
a
word
,
so
much
worse
than
the
abbess
of
*NL*
Andouillets
'
itself
--
that
I
was
just
opening
my
mouth
to
give
it
to
the
*NL*
devil
--
when
a
pert
vamping
chaise-undertaker
,
stepping
nimbly
across
*NL*
the
street
,
demanded
if
Monsieur
would
have
his
chaise
refitted
--
No
,
*NL*
no
,
said
I
,
shaking
my
head
sideways
--
Would
Monsieur
choose
to
sell
*NL*
it
?
rejoined
the
undertaker
--
With
all
my
soul
,
said
I
--
the
iron
work
is
*NL*
worth
forty
livres
--
and
the
glasses
worth
forty
more
--
and
the
leather
*NL*
you
may
take
to
live
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
mine
of
wealth
,
quoth
I
,
as
he
counted
me
the
money
,
has
this
*NL*
post-chaise
brought
me
in
?
And
this
is
my
usual
method
of
book-keeping
,
*NL*
at
least
with
the
disasters
of
life
--
making
a
penny
of
every
one
of
'em
*NL*
as
they
happen
to
me

Do
,
my

tell
the

how
I
behaved
under

the

most
oppressive
of

which
could
befal
me

proud
as

ought
to
be
of

'T

thou

coming
close
up
to

as
I
stood
with

garters
in
my

reflecting
upon
what
had
not

I
am

thou

whispering
these
words
in
my

ear
,

any
other
man
would
have
sunk
down

the

*NL*
--
Every
thing
is
good
for
something
,
quoth
I.
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
'll
go
into
Wales
for
six
weeks
,
and
drink
goat
's
whey
--
and
I
'll
*NL*
gain
seven
years
longer
life
for
the
accident
.
For
which
reason
I
think
*NL*
myself
inexcusable
,
for
blaming
Fortune
so
often
as
I
have
done
,
for
*NL*
pelting
me
all
my
life
long
,
like
an
ungracious
duchess
,
as
I
call
'd
*NL*
her
,
with
so
many
small
evils
:
surely
,
if
I
have
any
cause
to
be
angry
*NL*
with
her
,
't
is
that
she
has
not
sent
me
great
ones
--
a
score
of
good
*NL*
cursed
,
bouncing
losses
,
would
have
been
as
good
as
a
pension
to
me
.

*NL*

One
of

so
,
is
all
I
wish

I
would
not

To
those
who
call
vexations

Vexations
,
as
knowing
what
they
are
,
there
*NL*
could
not
be
a
greater
,
than
to
be
the
best
part
of
a
day
at
Lyons
,
*NL*
the
most
opulent
and
flourishing
city
in
France
,
enriched
with
the
most
*NL*
fragments
of
antiquity
--
and
not
be
able
to
see
it
.
To
be
withheld
upon
*NL*
any
account
,
must
be
a
vexation
;
but
to
be
withheld
by
a
vexation
--
must
*NL*
certainly
be
,
what
philosophy
justly
calls
Vexation
upon
Vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
got
my
two
dishes
of
milk
coffee
-LRB-
which
by
the
bye
is
excellently
*NL*
good
for
a
consumption
,
but
you
must
boil
the
milk
and
coffee
*NL*
together
--
otherwise
't
is
only
coffee
and
milk
-RRB-
--
and
as
it
was
no
more
*NL*
than
eight
in
the
morning
,
and
the
boat
did
not
go
off
till
noon
,
I
had
*NL*
time
to
see
enough
of
Lyons
to
tire
the
patience
of
all
the
friends
I
*NL*
had
in
the
world
with
it
.
I
will
take
a
walk
to
the
cathedral
,
said
I
,
*NL*
looking
at
my
list
,
and
see
the
wonderful
mechanism
of
this
great
clock
*NL*
of
Lippius
of
Basil
,
in
the
first
place
--
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
,
I
understand
the
least
of
mechanism
--
I
*NL*
have
neither
genius
,
or
taste
,
or
fancy
--
and
have
a
brain
so
entirely
*NL*
unapt
for
every
thing
of
that
kind
,
that
I
solemnly
declare
I
was
never
*NL*
yet
able
to
comprehend
the
principles
of
motion
of
a
squirrel
cage
,
or
a
*NL*
common
knife-grinder
's
wheel
--
tho
'
I
have
many
an
hour
of
my
life
look
'd
*NL*
up
with
great
devotion
at
the
one
--
and
stood
by
with
as
much
patience
as
*NL*
any
christian
ever
could
do
,
at
the
other
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
'll
go
see
the
surprising
movements
of
this
great
clock
,
said
I
,
the
*NL*
very
first
thing
I
do
:
and
then
I
will
pay
a
visit
to
the
great
library
*NL*
of
the
Jesuits
,
and
procure
,
if
possible
,
a
sight
of
the
thirty
volumes
*NL*
of
the
general
history
of
China
,
wrote
-LRB-
not
in
the
Tartarean
,
but
-RRB-
in
*NL*
the
Chinese
language
,
and
in
the
Chinese
character
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
almost
know
as
little
of
the
Chinese
language
,
as
I
do
of
the
*NL*
mechanism
of
Lippius
's
clock-work
;
so
,
why
these
should
have
jostled
*NL*
themselves
into
the
two
first
articles
of
my
list
--
I
leave
to
the
*NL*
curious
as
a
problem
of
Nature
.
I
own
it
looks
like
one
of
her
*NL*
ladyship
's
obliquities
;
and
they
who
court
her
,
are
interested
in
*NL*
finding
out
her
humour
as
much
as
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
curiosities
are
seen
,
quoth
I
,
half
addressing
myself
to
my
*NL*
valet
de
place
,
who
stood
behind
me
--
`
twill
be
no
hurt
if
we
go
to
the
*NL*
church
of
St.
Irenaeus
,
and
see
the
pillar
to
which
Christ
was
tied
--
and
*NL*
after
that
,
the
house
where
Pontius
Pilate
lived
--
'T
was
at
the
next
*NL*
town
,
said
the
valet
de
place
--
at
Vienne
;
I
am
glad
of
it
,
said
I
,
*NL*
rising
briskly
from
my
chair
,
and
walking
across
the
room
with
strides
*NL*
twice
as
long
as
my
usual
pace
--
`
for
so
much
the
sooner
shall
I
be
at
*NL*
the
Tomb
of
the
two
lovers
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
the
cause
of
this
movement
,
and
why
I
took
such
long
strides
in
*NL*
uttering
this
--
I
might
leave
to
the
curious
too
;
but
as
no
principle
*NL*
of
clock-work
is
concerned
in
it
--
`
twill
be
as
well
for
the
reader
if
I
*NL*
explain
it
myself
.

O

there

aera
in
the
life
of

,
when

the
brain
being
*NL*
tender
and
fibrillous
,
and
more
like
pap
than
any
thing
else
-RRB-
--
a
story
*NL*
read
of
two
fond
lovers
,
separated
from
each
other
by
cruel
parents
,
and
*NL*
by
still
more
cruel
destiny

Amandus

*NL*
Amandus
taken
captive
by
the
Turks
,
and
carried
to
the
emperor
of
*NL*
Morocco
's
court
,
where
the
princess
of
Morocco
falling
in
love
with
him
,
*NL*
keeps
him
twenty
years
in
prison
for
the
love
of
his
Amanda
.
--

*NL*
She
--
-LRB-
Amanda
-RRB-
all
the
time
wandering
barefoot
,
and
with
dishevell
'd

hair
,
o'er
rocks
and
mountains
,
enquiring
for
Amandus
!
--
Amandus

Amandus
!
--
making
every
hill
and
valley
to
echo
back
his
name

Amandus
!
at
every
town
and

,
sitting
down
forlorn
at
the
gate
--
Has
*NL*
Amandus

--
has
my
Amandus
enter
'd
?
--
till
,
--
going
round

and

round

chance
unexpected
bringing
them
at
the
same
moment
of
*NL*
the
night
,
though
by
different
ways
,
to
the
gate
of
Lyons
,
their
native
*NL*
city
,
and
each
in
well-known
accents
calling
out
aloud
,
*NL*
*NL*
Is
Amandus
/
Is
my
Amanda
still
alive
?
*NL*
*NL*
they
fly
into
each
other
's
arms
,
and
both
drop
down
dead
for
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
soft
aera
in
every
gentle
mortal
's
life
,
where
such
a
story
*NL*
affords
more
pabulum
to
the
brain
,
than
all
the
Frusts
,
and
Crusts
,
and
*NL*
Rusts
of
antiquity
,
which
travellers
can
cook
up
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
was
all
that
stuck
on
the
right
side
of
the
cullender
in
my
own
,
of
*NL*
what
Spon
and
others
,
in
their
accounts
of
Lyons
,
had
strained
into
it
;
*NL*
and
finding
,
moreover
,
in
some
Itinerary
,
but
in
what
God
knows
--
That
*NL*
sacred
to
the
fidelity
of
Amandus
and
Amanda
,
a
tomb
was
built
without
*NL*
the
gates
,
where
,
to
this
hour
,
lovers
called
upon
them
to
attest
their
*NL*
truths
--
I
never
could
get
into
a
scrape
of
that
kind
in
my
life
,
*NL*
but
this
tomb
of
the
lovers
would
,
somehow
or
other
,
come
in
at
the
*NL*
close
--
nay
such
a
kind
of
empire
had
it
establish
'd
over
me
,
that
I
*NL*
could
seldom
think
or
speak
of
Lyons
--
and
sometimes
not
so
much
as
see
*NL*
even
a
Lyons-waistcoat
,
but
this
remnant
of
antiquity
would
present
*NL*
itself
to
my
fancy
;
and
I
have
often
said
in
my
wild
way
of
running
*NL*
on
--
tho
'
I
fear
with
some
irreverence
--
'
I
thought
this
shrine
-LRB-
neglected
*NL*
as
it
was
-RRB-
as
valuable
as
that
of
Mecca
,
and
so
little
short
,
except
in
*NL*
wealth
,
of
the
Santa
Casa
itself
,
that
some
time
or
other
,
I
would
go
a
*NL*
pilgrimage
-LRB-
though
I
had
no
other
business
at
Lyons
-RRB-
on
purpose
to
pay
*NL*
it
a
visit
.

In

therefore

of
Videnda
at

this

last

was
not
,
*NL*
you
see

least
;
so
taking
a
dozen
or
two
of
longer
strides
than
usual
*NL*
cross
my
room
,
just
whilst
it
passed
my
brain
,
I
walked
down
calmly
*NL*
into
the
basse
cour
,
in
order
to
sally
forth
;
and
having
called
for
my
*NL*
bill
--
as
it
was
uncertain
whether
I
should
return
to
my
inn
,
I
had
paid
*NL*
it
--
had
moreover
given
the
maid
ten
sous
,
and
was
just
receiving
the
*NL*
dernier
compliments
of
Monsieur
Le
Blanc
,
for
a
pleasant
voyage
down
the
*NL*
Rhone

was
stopped
at

*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
was
by
a
poor
ass
,
who
had
just
turned
in
with
a
couple
of
large
*NL*
panniers
upon
his
back
,
to
collect
eleemosynary
turnip-tops
and
*NL*
cabbage-leaves
;
and
stood
dubious
,
with
his
two
fore-feet
on
the
inside
*NL*
of
the
threshold
,
and
with
his
two
hinder
feet
towards
the
street
,
as
*NL*
not
knowing
very
well
whether
he
was
to
go
in
or
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
't
is
an
animal
-LRB-
be
in
what
hurry
I
may
-RRB-
I
can
not
bear
to
*NL*
strike
--
there
is
a
patient
endurance
of
sufferings
,
wrote
so
*NL*
unaffectedly
in
his
looks
and
carriage
,
which
pleads
so
mightily
for
*NL*
him
,
that
it
always
disarms
me
;
and
to
that
degree
,
that
I
do
not
*NL*
like
to
speak
unkindly
to
him
:
on
the
contrary
,
meet
him
where
I
*NL*
will
--
whether
in
town
or
country
--
in
cart
or
under
panniers
--
whether
*NL*
in
liberty
or
bondage
--
I
have
ever
something
civil
to
say
to
him
on
my
*NL*
part
;
and
as
one
word
begets
another
-LRB-
if
he
has
as
little
to
do
as
*NL*
I
-RRB-
--
I
generally
fall
into
conversation
with
him
;
and
surely
never
is
my
*NL*
imagination
so
busy
as
in
framing
his
responses
from
the
etchings
of
his
*NL*
countenance
--
and
where
those
carry
me
not
deep
enough
--
in
flying
from
my
*NL*
own
heart
into
his
,
and
seeing
what
is
natural
for
an
ass
to
think
--
as
*NL*
well
as
a
man
,
upon
the
occasion
.
In
truth
,
it
is
the
only
creature
*NL*
of
all
the
classes
of
beings
below
me
,
with
whom
I
can
do
this
:
for
*NL*
parrots
,
jackdaws
,
&
c.
--
I
never
exchange
a
word
with
them
--
nor
with
*NL*
the
apes
,
&
c.
for
pretty
near
the
same
reason
;
they
act
by
rote
,
as
the
*NL*
others
speak
by
it
,
and
equally
make
me
silent
:
nay
my
dog
and
my
*NL*
cat
,
though
I
value
them
both
--
-LRB-
and
for
my
dog
he
would
speak
if
he
*NL*
could
-RRB-
--
yet
somehow
or
other
,
they
neither
of
them
possess
the
talents
*NL*
for
conversation
--
I
can
make
nothing
of
a
discourse
with
them
,
beyond
*NL*
the
proposition
,
the
reply
,
and
rejoinder
,
which
terminated
my
father
's
*NL*
and
my
mother
's
conversations
,
in
his
beds
of
justice
--
and
those
*NL*
utter
'd
--
there
's
an
end
of
the
dialogue
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
with
an
ass
,
I
can
commune
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Come
,
Honesty
!
said
I
,
--
seeing
it
was
impracticable
to
pass
betwixt
him
*NL*
and
the
gate
--
art
thou
for
coming
in
,
or
going
out
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
ass
twisted
his
head
round
to
look
up
the
street
--
*NL*
*NL*
Well
--
replied
I
--
we
'll
wait
a
minute
for
thy
driver
:
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
turned
his
head
thoughtful
about
,
and
looked
wistfully
the
opposite
*NL*
way
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
understand
thee
perfectly
,
answered
I
--
If
thou
takest
a
wrong
step
*NL*
in
this
affair
,
he
will
cudgel
thee
to
death
--
Well
!
a
minute
is
but
a
*NL*
minute
,
and
if
it
saves
a
fellow-creature
a
drubbing
,
it
shall
not
be
*NL*
set
down
as
ill-spent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
eating
the
stem
of
an
artichoke
as
this
discourse
went
on
,
and
*NL*
in
the
little
peevish
contentions
of
nature
betwixt
hunger
and
*NL*
unsavouriness
,
had
dropt
it
out
of
his
mouth
half
a
dozen
times
,
and
*NL*
pick
'd
it
up
again
--
God
help
thee
,
Jack
!
said
I
,
thou
hast
a
bitter
*NL*
breakfast
o
n't
--
and
many
a
bitter
day
's
labour
,
--
and
many
a
bitter
blow
,
*NL*
I
fear
,
for
its
wages
--
't
is
all
--
all
bitterness
to
thee
,
whatever
life
*NL*
is
to
others
.
--
And
now
thy
mouth
,
if
one
knew
the
truth
of
it
,
is
as
*NL*
bitter
,
I
dare
say
,
as
soot
--
-LRB-
for
he
had
cast
aside
the
stem
-RRB-
and
thou
*NL*
hast
not
a
friend
perhaps
in
all
this
world
,
that
will
give
thee
a
*NL*
macaroon
.
--
In
saying
this
,
I
pull
'd
out
a
paper
of
'em
,
which
I
had
just
*NL*
purchased
,
and
gave
him
one
--
and
at
this
moment
that
I
am
telling
it
,
*NL*
my
heart
smites
me
,
that
there
was
more
of
pleasantry
in
the
conceit
,
*NL*
of
seeing
how
an
ass
would
eat
a
macaroon
--
than
of
benevolence
in
giving
*NL*
him
one
,
which
presided
in
the
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ass

his

seem

hung

rather
backwards

as

it
broke
short
in

look

up

coming

let

fall
a

*NL*
Out

cried
I

but
the
interjection
was
equivocal

and
,
I
think
,
*NL*
wrong
placed
too
--
for
the
end
of
an
osier
which
had
started
out
from
the
*NL*
contexture
of
the
ass

had
caught
hold
of
my

,
*NL*
as
he
rush
'd
by
me

rent
it
in
the
most
disastrous
direction
you
can

imagine

so
that

Out

in

should
have
come
in

this
I
leave

I
came
down

into

my

de

,
in
order
to
sally
out
towards
the
tomb
of
the

two

,

and
was
a

stopp
'd
at

not

by
the
person

struck

who
,
by

had
taken
*NL*
possession
-LRB-
as
is

of
the
very
spot
of

It
was
a

me

in

for
the

'T

continued
I
,
addressing
myself
to
the
*NL*
commissary

changing
only
the
form
of
my
asseveration
--
that
I
owe
the
*NL*
king
of

nothing
but
my
good
will
;
for
he
is
a
very
honest
man
,

I
wish
him
all
health

pastime
in

Pardonnez

replied
the

,
you
are

to
him
six

for
the
next
post
from

to
St.

in

being
a
post
royal
,
you
pay
double
for
the
*NL*
horses

postillion

otherwise

have
amounted

making
him

The

made
me

I

was
standing

collecting
myself

As
I
perceived
the
commissary
of

post-office
would
have
his
six
*NL*
livres
four
sous
,
I
had
nothing
else
for
it

but
to
say
some
smart
thing
*NL*
upon
the
occasion
,
worth
the
money
:
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
I
set
off
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
pray
,
Mr.
Commissary
,
by
what
law
of
courtesy
is
a
defenceless
*NL*
stranger
to
be
used
just
the
reverse
from
what
you
use
a
Frenchman
in
*NL*
this
matter
?
*NL*
*NL*
By
no
means
;
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excuse
me
;
said
I
--
for
you
have
begun
,
Sir
,
with
first
tearing
off
my
*NL*
breeches-and
now
you
want
my
pocket
--
*NL*
*NL*
Whereas
--
had
you
first
taken
my
pocket
,
as
you
do
with
your
own
*NL*
people
--
and
then
left
me
bare
a.
.
'd
after
--
I
had
been
a
beast
to
have
*NL*
complain
'd
--
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
is
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
contrary

of

'T
is

*NL*
*NL*

'T

not

'T

I

read
on

*NL*
*NL*
--
By
all
which
it
appears
,
quoth
I
,
having
read
it
over
,
a
little
too
*NL*
rapidly
,
that
if
a
man
sets
out
in
a
post-chaise
from
Paris
--
he
must
go
*NL*
on
travelling
in
one
,
all
the
days
of
his
life
--
or
pay
for
it
.
--
Excuse
*NL*
me
,
said
the
commissary
,
the
spirit
of
the
ordinance
is
this
--
That
if
*NL*
you
set
out
with
an
intention
of
running
post
from
Paris
to
Avignon
,
&
c.
*NL*
you
shall
not
change
that
intention
or
mode
of
travelling
,
without
first
*NL*
satisfying
the
fermiers
for
two
posts
further
than
the
place
you
repent
*NL*
at
--
and
't
is
founded
,
continued
he
,
upon
this
,
that
the
Revenues
are
not
*NL*
to
fall
short
through
your
fickleness
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
O
by
heavens
!
cried
I
--
if
fickleness
is
taxable
in
France
--
we
have
*NL*
nothing
to
do
but
to
make
the
best
peace
with
you
we
can
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
So
the
Peace
Was
Made
;
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
if
it
is
a
bad
one
--
as
Tristram
Shandy
laid
the
corner-stone
of
*NL*
it
--
nobody
but
Tristram
Shandy
ought
to
be
hanged

came

I

note
down

my

putting

may

take

what
I
should

when

*NL*
The
wife
of

chaise-vamper
stepp
'd
in

I
told
you
,
to
take
the
*NL*
papilliotes
from
off
her
hair
--
the
toilet
stands
still
for
no

so
*NL*
she
jerk
'd
off
her
cap
,
to
begin
with
them
as
she
open
'd
the
door
,
in
*NL*
doing
which
,
one
of
them
fell
upon
the
ground
--
I
instantly
saw
it
was
my
*NL*
own
writing
--
*NL*
*NL*
O
Seigneur

cried
I
--
you
have
got
all
my
remarks
upon

*NL*
Madam

--
J'en

mortifiee

said
she
--
't
is
well
,
thinks
I
,
they
*NL*
have
stuck
there
--
for
could
they
have
gone
deeper
,
they
would
have
made
*NL*
such
confusion
in
a
French
woman

noddle

She
had
better
have
gone
with
*NL*
it
unfrizled
,
to
the

*NL*
*NL*
Tenez

said
she
--
so
without
any
idea
of
the
nature
of
my
suffering
,
*NL*
she
took
them
from
her
curls
,
and
put
them
gravely
one
by
one
into
my
*NL*
hat
--
one
was
twisted
this
way

another
twisted
that

ey

by
my
faith
;
*NL*
and
when

I

They
will
be
worse
twisted
still

And
now
for
Lippius
's
clock
!
said
I
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
,
who
had
got
*NL*
thro
'
all
his
difficulties
--
nothing
can
prevent
us
seeing
that
,
and
the
*NL*
Chinese
history
,
&
c.
except
the
time
,
said
Francois
--
for
't
is
almost
*NL*
eleven
--
then
we
must
speed
the
faster
,
said
I
,
striding
it
away
to
the
*NL*
cathedral
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
say
,
in
my
heart
,
that
it
gave
me
any
concern
in
being
told
*NL*
by
one
of
the
minor
canons
,
as
I
was
entering
the
west
door
,
--
That
*NL*
Lippius
's
great
clock
was
all
out
of
joints
,
and
had
not
gone
for
some
*NL*
years
--
It
will
give
me
the
more
time
,
thought
I
,
to
peruse
the
Chinese
*NL*
history
;
and
besides
I
shall
be
able
to
give
the
world
a
better
account
*NL*
of
the
clock
in
its
decay
,
than
I
could
have
done
in
its
flourishing
*NL*
condition
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
so
away
I
posted
to
the
college
of
the
Jesuits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
is
with
the
project
of
getting
a
peep
at
the
history
of
China
in
*NL*
Chinese
characters
--
as
with
many
others
I
could
mention
,
which
strike
*NL*
the
fancy
only
at
a
distance
;
for
as
I
came
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
*NL*
point
--
my
blood
cool
'd
--
the
freak
gradually
went
off
,
till
at
length
I
*NL*
would
not
have
given
a
cherry-stone
to
have
it
gratified
--
The
truth
was
,
*NL*
my
time
was
short
,
and
my
heart
was
at
the
Tomb
of
the
Lovers
--
I
wish
to
*NL*
God
,
said
I
,
as
I
got
the
rapper
in
my
hand
,
that
the
key
of
the
library
*NL*
may
be
but
lost
;
it
fell
out
as
well
--
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
the
Jesuits
had
got
the
cholic
--
and
to
that
degree
,
as
never
was
*NL*
known
in
the
memory
of
the
oldest

As
I
knew
the
geography
of
the
Tomb
of
the
Lovers
,
as
well
as
if
I
had
*NL*
lived
twenty
years
in
Lyons
,
namely
,
that
it
was
upon
the
turning
of
my
*NL*
right
hand
,
just
without
the
gate
,
leading
to
the
Fauxbourg
de
Vaise
--
I
*NL*
dispatched
Francois
to
the
boat
,
that
I
might
pay
the
homage
I
so
long
*NL*
ow
'd
it
,
without
a
witness
of
my
weakness
--
I
walk
'd
with
all
imaginable
*NL*
joy
towards
the
place
--
when
I
saw
the
gate
which
intercepted
the
tomb
,
*NL*
my
heart
glowed
within
me
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tender
and
faithful
spirits
!
cried
I
,
addressing
myself
to
Amandus
and
*NL*
Amanda
--
long

long
have
I
tarried
to
drop
this
tear
upon
your
tomb

come

I
came

there
was
no

to
drop
it
upon

*NL*
*NL*
No
matter
how
,
or
in
what
mood
--
but
I
flew
from
the
tomb
of
the
*NL*
lovers
--
or
rather
I
did
not
fly
from
it
--
-LRB-
for
there
was
no
such
thing
*NL*
existing
-RRB-
and
just
got
time
enough
to
the
boat
to
save
my
passage
;
--
and
*NL*
ere
I
had
sailed
a
hundred
yards
,
the
Rhone
and
the
Saon
met
together
,
*NL*
and
carried
me
down
merrily
betwixt
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
have
described
this
voyage
down
the
Rhone
,
before
I
made
it
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
So
now
I
am
at
Avignon
,
and
as
there
is
nothing
to
see
but
the
old
*NL*
house
,
in
which
the
duke
of
Ormond
resided
,
and
nothing
to
stop
me
but
*NL*
a
short
remark
upon
the
place
,
in
three
minutes
you
will
see
me
crossing
*NL*
the
bridge
upon
a
mule
,
with
Francois
upon
a
horse
with
my
portmanteau
*NL*
behind
him
,
and
the
owner
of
both
,
striding
the
way
before
us
,
with
a
*NL*
long
gun
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
a
sword
under
his
arm
,
lest
peradventure
*NL*
we
should
run
away
with
his
cattle
.
Had
you
seen
my
breeches
in
entering
*NL*
Avignon
,
--
Though
you
'd
have
seen
them
better
,
I
think
,
as
I
mounted
--
you
*NL*
would
not
have
thought
the
precaution
amiss
,
or
found
in
your
heart
to
*NL*
have
taken
it
in
dudgeon
;
for
my
own
part
,
I
took
it
most
kindly
;
and
*NL*
determined
to
make
him
a
present
of
them
,
when
we
got
to
the
end
of
our
*NL*
journey
,
for
the
trouble
they
had
put
him
to
,
of
arming
himself
at
all
*NL*
points
against
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
go
further
,
let
me
get
rid
of
my
remark
upon
Avignon
,
which
is
*NL*
this
:
That
I
think
it
wrong
,
merely
because
a
man
's
hat
has
been
blown
*NL*
off
his
head
by
chance
the
first
night
he
comes
to
Avignon
,
--
that
he
*NL*
should
therefore
say
,
`
Avignon
is
more
subject
to
high
winds
than
any
*NL*
town
in
all
France
:
'
for
which
reason
I
laid
no
stress
upon
the
accident
*NL*
till
I
had
enquired
of
the
master
of
the
inn
about
it
,
who
telling
me
*NL*
seriously
it
was
so
--
and
hearing
,
moreover
,
the
windiness
of
Avignon
*NL*
spoke
of
in
the
country
about
as
a
proverb
--
I
set
it
down
,
merely
to
ask
*NL*
the
learned
what
can
be
the
cause
--
the
consequence
I
saw
--
for
they
*NL*
are
all
Dukes
,
Marquisses
,
and
Counts
,
there
--
the
duce
a
Baron
,
in
all
*NL*
Avignon
--
so
that
there
is
scarce
any
talking
to
them
on
a
windy
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Prithee
,
friend
,
said
I
,
take
hold
of
my
mule
for
a
moment
--
for
I
*NL*
wanted
to
pull
off
one
of
my
jack-boots
,
which
hurt
my
heel
--
the
man
was
*NL*
standing
quite
idle
at
the
door
of
the
inn
,
and
as
I
had
taken
it
into
*NL*
my
head
,
he
was
someway
concerned
about
the
house
or
stable
,
I
put
the
*NL*
bridle
into
his
hand
--
so
begun
with
the
boot
:
--
when
I
had
finished
the
*NL*
affair
,
I
turned
about
to
take
the
mule
from
the
man
,
and
thank
him
--

But
Monsieur
le
Marquis
had
walked
in

*NL*
*NL*
I
had
now
the
whole
south
of
France
,
from
the
banks
of
the
Rhone
to
*NL*
those
of
the
Garonne
,
to
traverse
upon
my
mule
at
my
own
leisure
--
at
my
*NL*
own
leisure
--
for
I
had
left
Death
,
the
Lord
knows
--
and
He
only
--
how
far
*NL*
behind
me
--
'
I
have
followed
many
a
man
thro
'
France
,
quoth
he
--
but
never
*NL*
at
this
mettlesome
rate
.
'
--
Still
he
followed
,
--
and
still
I
fled
him
--
but
*NL*
I
fled
him
cheerfully
--
still
he
pursued
--
but
,
like
one
who
pursued
*NL*
his
prey
without
hope
--
as
he
lagg
'd
,
every
step
he
lost
,
softened
his
*NL*
looks
--
why
should
I
fly
him
at
this
rate
?
*NL*
*NL*
So
notwithstanding
all
the
commissary
of
the
post-office
had
said
,
I
*NL*
changed
the
mode
of
my
travelling
once
more
;
and
,
after
so
precipitate
*NL*
and
rattling
a
course
as
I
had
run
,
I
flattered
my
fancy
with
thinking
*NL*
of
my
mule
,
and
that
I
should
traverse
the
rich
plains
of
Languedoc
upon
*NL*
his
back
,
as
slowly
as
foot
could
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
more
pleasing
to
a
traveller
--
or
more
terrible
to
*NL*
travel-writers
,
than
a
large
rich
plain
;
especially
if
it
is
without
*NL*
great
rivers
or
bridges
;
and
presents
nothing
to
the
eye
,
but
one
*NL*
unvaried
picture
of
plenty
:
for
after
they
have
once
told
you
,
that
*NL*
't
is
delicious
!
or
delightful
!
-LRB-
as
the
case
happens
-RRB-
--
that
the
soil
was
*NL*
grateful
,
and
that
nature
pours
out
all
her
abundance
,
&
c.
.
.
they
have
*NL*
then
a
large
plain
upon
their
hands
,
which
they
know
not
what
to
do
*NL*
with
--
and
which
is
of
little
or
no
use
to
them
but
to
carry
them
to
some
*NL*
town
;
and
that
town
,
perhaps
of
little
more
,
but
a
new
place
to
start
*NL*
from
to
the
next
plain
--
and
so
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
This
is
most
terrible
work
;
judge
if
I
do
n't
manage
my
plains
better
.

*NL*
I
had
not
gone
above
two
leagues
and
a
half
,
before
the
man
with
his
gun
*NL*
began
to
look
at
his
priming
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
three
several
times
loiter
'd
terribly
behind
;
half
a
mile
at
least
*NL*
every
time
;
once
,
in
deep
conference
with
a
drum-maker
,
who
was
making
*NL*
drums
for
the
fairs
of
Baucaira
and
Tarascone
--
I
did
not
understand
the
*NL*
principles
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
time
,
I
can
not
so
properly
say
,
I
stopp
'd
--
for
meeting
a
*NL*
couple
of
Franciscans
straitened
more
for
time
than
myself
,
and
not
*NL*
being
able
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
I
was
about
--
I
had
turn
'd
back
*NL*
with
them
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
third
,
was
an
affair
of
trade
with
a
gossip
,
for
a
hand-basket
of
*NL*
Provence
figs
for
four
sous
;
this
would
have
been
transacted
at
once
;
*NL*
but
for
a
case
of
conscience
at
the
close
of
it
;
for
when
the
figs
were
*NL*
paid
for
,
it
turn
'd
out
,
that
there
were
two
dozen
of
eggs
covered
over
*NL*
with
vine-leaves
at
the
bottom
of
the
basket
--
as
I
had
no
intention
of
*NL*
buying
eggs
--
I
made
no
sort
of
claim
of
them
--
as
for
the
space
they
had
*NL*
occupied
--
what
signified
it
?
I
had
figs
enow
for
my
money
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
it
was
my
intention
to
have
the
basket
--
it
was
the
gossip
's
*NL*
intention
to
keep
it
,
without
which
,
she
could
do
nothing
with
her
*NL*
eggs
--
and
unless
I
had
the
basket
,
I
could
do
as
little
with
my
figs
,
*NL*
which
were
too
ripe
already
,
and
most
of
'em
burst
at
the
side
:
this
*NL*
brought
on
a
short
contention
,
which
terminated
in
sundry
proposals
,
*NL*
what
we
should
both
do
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
How
we
disposed
of
our
eggs
and
figs
,
I
defy
you
,
or
the
Devil
*NL*
himself
,
had
he
not
been
there
-LRB-
which
I
am
persuaded
he
was
-RRB-
,
to
form
*NL*
the
least
probable
conjecture
:
You
will
read
the
whole
of
it
--
not
this
*NL*
year
,
for
I
am
hastening
to
the
story
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
amours
--
but
*NL*
you
will
read
it
in
the
collection
of
those
which
have
arose
out
of
the
*NL*
journey
across
this
plain
--
and
which
,
therefore
,
I
call
my
*NL*
*NL*
Plain
Stories
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
far
my
pen
has
been
fatigued
,
like
those
of
other
travellers
,
in
*NL*
this
journey
of
it
,
over
so
barren
a
track
--
the
world
must
judge
--
but
*NL*
the
traces
of
it
,
which
are
now
all
set
o
'
vibrating
together
this
*NL*
moment
,
tell
me
't
is
the
most
fruitful
and
busy
period
of
my
life
;
for
*NL*
as
I
had
made
no
convention
with
my
man
with
the
gun
,
as
to
time
--
by
*NL*
stopping
and
talking
to
every
soul
I
met
,
who
was
not
in
a
full
*NL*
trot
--
joining
all
parties
before
me
--
waiting
for
every
soul
*NL*
behind
--
hailing
all
those
who
were
coming
through
cross-roads
--
arresting
*NL*
all
kinds
of
beggars
,
pilgrims
,
fiddlers
,
friars
--
not
passing
by
a
woman
*NL*
in
a
mulberry-tree
without
commending
her
legs
,
and
tempting
her
into
*NL*
conversation
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
--
In
short
,
by
seizing
every
handle
,
*NL*
of
what
size
or
shape
soever
,
which
chance
held
out
to
me
in
this
*NL*
journey
--
I
turned
my
plain
into
a
city
--
I
was
always
in

with

variety

as
my

loved
society

myself

had
some
proposals
always
on
his

offer
to
every

met

I
am
confident
we
could
have
passed
through
Pall-Mall

St.
*NL*
James

Street
,
for
a

together

fewer

*NL*
O

there
is
that
sprightly
frankness
,
which
at
once
unpins
every
plait
*NL*
of
a
Languedocian
's
dress
--
that
whatever
is
beneath
it
,
it
looks
so
*NL*
like
the
simplicity
which
poets
sing
of
in
better
days

I
will
delude
my
*NL*
fancy
,

believe
it
is
so

'T

wine

which
by

belongs
to

The

had
tied
up
*NL*
their

afresh

and
the
swains
were
preparing
for
a
carousal

my

*NL*
made
a
dead
point

I
never

argue
a

leaping
off

A

rose
up

I
advanced
towards

her
hair

which
was
a

chesnut
approaching

was
tied
up

letting

leading

up

A
lame
youth

whom
Apollo
had
recompensed
with
a
pipe
,
and
to
which
he
*NL*
had
added
a
tabourin
of
his
own
accord
,
ran
sweetly
over
the
prelude
,
*NL*
as
he
sat
upon
the
bank

Tie
me
up

instantly

said
Nannette

*NL*
putting
a
piece
of
string
into

It
taught
me
to
forget
I
was
a

stranger

The
whole
knot
fell
down
--
We
had
been
seven
years
acquainted

*NL*
The
youth
struck
the
note
upon

followed

The

Capriciously
did
she
bend

dance
up
insidious

But
now
I
am
talking
of
beginning
a

and
have
long
had
a
thing
upon
*NL*
my
mind
to
be
imparted
to
the
reader
,
which
,
if
not
imparted
now

can
*NL*
never

the
Comparison
may
*NL*
be
imparted
to

any
hour
in

-RRB-
--
I
'll
just
mention
it
,
and
begin
*NL*
in
good
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thing
is
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
of
all
the
several
ways
of
beginning
a
book
which
are
now
in
*NL*
practice
throughout
the
known
world
,
I
am
confident
my
own
way
of
doing
*NL*
it
is
the
best
--
I
'm
sure
it
is
the
most
religious
--
for
I
begin
with
*NL*
writing
the
first
sentence
--
and
trusting
to
Almighty
God
for
the
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Twould
cure
an
author
for
ever
of
the
fuss
and
folly
of
opening
his
*NL*
street-door
,
and
calling
in
his
neighbours
and
friends
,
and
kinsfolk
,
*NL*
with
the
devil
and
all
his
imps
,
with
their
hammers
and
engines
,
&
c.
*NL*
only
to
observe
how
one
sentence
of
mine
follows
another
,
and
how
the
*NL*
plan
follows
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
you
saw
me
half
starting
out
of
my
chair
,
with
what
confidence
,
*NL*
as
I
grasp
the
elbow
of
it
,
I
look
up
--
catching
the
idea
,
even
sometimes
*NL*
before
it
half
way
reaches
me
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
in
my
conscience
I
intercept
many
a
thought
which
heaven
*NL*
intended
for
another
man
.

*NL*
Pope

his
Portrait

Pope

fools

me

no

ever
so
full

faith
or
fire

I
wish
I
could
say
of
good
works
*NL*
too

I
have
no

Zeal

errantest

in
science

in
politics

shall
*NL*
never
kindle
a

within
me

have
a

to
wear

could

seen

was
as
bad

I
wish
my
uncle
Toby
had
been
a
water-drinker
;
for
then
the
thing
had
*NL*
been
accounted
for
,
That
the
first
moment
Widow
Wadman
saw
him
,
she
felt
*NL*
something
stirring
within
her
in
his
favour
--
Something
!
--
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Something
perhaps
more
than
friendship
--
less
than
love
--
something
--
no
*NL*
matter
what
--
no
matter
where
--
I
would
not
give
a
single
hair
off
my
*NL*
mule
's
tail
,
and
be
obliged
to
pluck
it
off
myself
-LRB-
indeed
the
villain
*NL*
has
not
many
to
spare
,
and
is
not
a
little
vicious
into
the
bargain
-RRB-
,
to
*NL*
be
let
by
your
worships
into
the
secret
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
truth
is
,
my
uncle
Toby
was
not
a
water-drinker
;
he
drank
it
*NL*
neither
pure
nor
mix
'd
,
or
any
how
,
or
any
where
,
except
fortuitously
*NL*
upon
some
advanced
posts
,
where
better
liquor
was
not
to
be
had
--
or
*NL*
during
the
time
he
was
under
cure
;
when
the
surgeon
telling
him
it
would
*NL*
extend
the
fibres
,
and
bring
them
sooner
into
contact
--
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
drank
it
for
quietness
sake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
as
all
the
world
knows
,
that
no
effect
in
nature
can
be
produced
*NL*
without
a
cause
,
and
as
it
is
as
well
known
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
was
*NL*
neither
a
weaver
--
a
gardener
,
or
a
gladiator
--
unless
as
a
captain
,
you
*NL*
will
needs
have
him
one
--
but
then
he
was
only
a
captain
of
foot
--
and
*NL*
besides
,
the
whole
is
an
equivocation
--
There
is
nothing
left
for
us
to
*NL*
suppose
,
but
that
my
uncle
Toby
's
leg
--
but
that
will
avail
us
little
in
*NL*
the
present
hypothesis
,
unless
it
had
proceeded
from
some
ailment
in
*NL*
the
foot
--
whereas
his
leg
was
not
emaciated
from
any
disorder
in
his
*NL*
foot
--
for
my
uncle
Toby
's
leg
was
not
emaciated
at
all
.
It
was
a
little
*NL*
stiff
and
awkward
,
from
a
total
disuse
of
it
,
for
the
three
years
he
lay
*NL*
confined
at
my
father
's
house
in
town
;
but
it
was
plump
and
muscular
,
*NL*
and
in
all
other
respects
as
good
and
promising
a
leg
as
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
declare
,
I
do
not
recollect
any
one
opinion
or
passage
of
my
life
,
*NL*
where
my
understanding
was
more
at
a
loss
to
make
ends
meet
,
and
torture
*NL*
the
chapter
I
had
been
writing
,
to
the
service
of
the
chapter
following
*NL*
it
,
than
in
the
present
case
:
one
would
think
I
took
a
pleasure
in
*NL*
running
into
difficulties
of
this
kind
,
merely
to
make
fresh
experiments
*NL*
of
getting
out
of
'em
--
Inconsiderate
soul
that
thou
art
!
What
!
are
not
*NL*
the
unavoidable
distresses
with
which
,
as
an
author
and
a
man
,
thou
art
*NL*
hemm
'd
in
on
every
side
of
thee
--
are
they
,
Tristram
,
not
sufficient
,
but
*NL*
thou
must
entangle
thyself
still
more
?
*NL*
*NL*
Is
it
not
enough
that
thou
art
in
debt
,
and
that
thou
hast
ten
*NL*
cart-loads
of
thy
fifth

sixth
volumes
-LRB-
Alluding
to
the
first
*NL*
edition

-RRB-
still
--
still
unsold
,
and
art
almost
at
thy
wit
's
ends
,
how
to
*NL*
get
them
off
thy
hands
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
hour
art
thou
not
tormented
with
the
vile
asthma
that
thou
*NL*
gattest
in
skating
against
the
wind
in
Flanders
?
and
is
it
but
two
*NL*
months
ago
,
that
in
a
fit
of
laughter
,
on
seeing
a
cardinal
make
water
*NL*
like
a
quirister
-LRB-
with
both
hands
-RRB-
thou
brakest
a
vessel
in
thy
lungs
,
*NL*
whereby
,
in
two
hours
,
thou
lost
as
many
quarts
of
blood
;
and
hadst
thou
*NL*
lost
as
much
more
,
did
not
the
faculty
tell
thee
--
it
would
have
amounted
*NL*
to
a
gallon

My
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
had
posted
down
with
so
much
heat
and
*NL*
precipitation
,
to
take
possession
of
the
spot
of
ground
we
have
so
often
*NL*
spoke
of
,
in
order
to
open
their
campaign
as
early
as
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
allies
;
that
they
had
forgot
one
of
the
most
necessary
articles
of
the
*NL*
whole
affair
,
it
was
neither
a
pioneer
's
spade
,
a
pickax
,
or
a
shovel
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
was
a
bed
to
lie
on
:
so
that
as
Shandy-Hall
was
at
that
time
*NL*
unfurnished
;
and
the
little
inn
where
poor
Le
Fever
died
,
not
yet
built
;
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
was
constrained
to
accept
of
a
bed
at
Mrs.
Wadman
's
,
for
*NL*
a
night
or
two
,
till
corporal
Trim
-LRB-
who
to
the
character
of
an
excellent
*NL*
valet
,
groom
,
cook
,
sempster
,
surgeon
,
and
engineer
,
super-added
that
of
*NL*
an
excellent
upholsterer
too
-RRB-
,
with
the
help
of
a
carpenter
and
a
couple
*NL*
of
taylors
,
constructed
one
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
daughter
of
Eve
,
for
such
was
widow
Wadman
,
and
't
is
all
the
character
*NL*
I
intend
to
give
of
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
`
That
she
was
a
perfect
woman
--
'
had
better
be
fifty
leagues
off
--
or
*NL*
in
her
warm
bed
--
or
playing
with
a
case-knife
--
or
any
thing
you
*NL*
please
--
than
make
a
man
the
object
of
her
attention
,
when
the
house
and
*NL*
all
the
furniture
is
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
in
it
out
of
doors
and
in
broad
day-light
,
where
a
*NL*
woman
has
a
power
,
physically
speaking
,
of
viewing
a
man
in
more
lights
*NL*
than
one
--
but
here
,
for
her
soul
,
she
can
see
him
in
no
light
without
*NL*
mixing
something
of
her
own
goods
and
chattels
along
with
him
--
till
*NL*
by
reiterated
acts
of
such
combination
,
he
gets
foisted
into
her
*NL*
inventory
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
then
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
is
not
matter
of
System
;
for
I
have
delivered
that
above
--
nor
*NL*
is
it
matter
of
Breviary
--
for
I
make
no
man
's
creed
but
my
own
--
nor
*NL*
matter
of
Fact
--
at
least
that
I
know
of

't
is

copulative

*NL*
introductory

I
do
not
speak
it
with
regard
to
the
coarseness
or
cleanness
of
them
--
or
*NL*
the
strength
of
their
gussets
--
but
pray
do
not
night-shifts
differ
*NL*
from
day-shifts
as
much
in
this
particular
,
as
in
any
thing
else
in
the
*NL*
world
;
that
they
so
far
exceed
the
others
in
length
,
that
when
you
*NL*
are
laid
down
in
them
,
they
fall
almost
as
much
below
the
feet
,
as
the
*NL*
day-shifts
fall
short
of
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
Widow
Wadman
's
night-shifts
-LRB-
as
was
the
mode
I
suppose
in
King
William
's
*NL*
and
Queen
Anne
's
reigns
-RRB-
were
cut
however
after
this
fashion
;
and
if
the
*NL*
fashion
is
changed
-LRB-
for
in
Italy
they
are
come
to
nothing
-RRB-
--
so
much
the
*NL*
worse
for
the
public
;
they
were
two
Flemish
ells
and
a
half
in
length
,
*NL*
so
that
allowing
a
moderate
woman
two
ells
,
she
had
half
an
ell
to
*NL*
spare
,
to
do
what
she
would
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
from
one
little
indulgence
gained
after
another
,
in
the
many
*NL*
bleak
and
decemberley
nights
of
a
seven
years
widow-hood
,
things
*NL*
had
insensibly
come
to
this
pass
,
and
for
the
two
last
years
had
got
*NL*
establish
'd
into
one
of
the
ordinances
of
the
bed-chamber
--
That
as
soon
*NL*
as
Mrs.
Wadman
was
put
to
bed
,
and
had
got
her
legs
stretched
down
to
*NL*
the
bottom
of
it
,
of
which
she
always
gave
Bridget
notice
--
Bridget
,
with
*NL*
all
suitable
decorum
,
having
first
open
'd
the
bed-clothes
at
the
feet
,
*NL*
took
hold
of
the
half-ell
of
cloth
we
are
speaking
of
,
and
having
*NL*
gently
,
and
with
both
her
hands
,
drawn
it
downwards
to
its
furthest
*NL*
extension
,
and
then
contracted
it
again
side-long
by
four
or
five
even
*NL*
plaits
,
she
took
a
large
corking-pin
out
of
her
sleeve
,
and
with
the
*NL*
point
directed
towards
her
,
pinn
'd
the
plaits
all
fast
together
a
little
*NL*
above
the
hem
;
which
done
,
she
tuck
'd
all
in
tight
at
the
feet
,
and
*NL*
wish
'd
her
mistress
a
good
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
constant
,
and
without
any
other
variation
than
this
;
that
on
*NL*
shivering
and
tempestuous
nights
,
when
Bridget
untuck
'd
the
feet
of
the
*NL*
bed
,
&
c.
to
do
this
--
she
consulted
no
thermometer
but
that
of
her
*NL*
own
passions
;
and
so
performed
it
standing
--
kneeling
--
or
squatting
,
*NL*
according
to
the
different
degrees
of
faith
,
hope
,
and
charity
,
she
was
*NL*
in
,
and
bore
towards
her
mistress
that
night
.
In
every
other
respect
,
*NL*
the
etiquette
was
sacred
,
and
might
have
vied
with
the
most
mechanical
*NL*
one
of
the
most
inflexible
bed-chamber
in
Christendom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
night
,
as
soon
as
the
corporal
had
conducted
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
up
stairs
,
which
was
about
ten
--
Mrs.
Wadman
threw
herself
into
her
*NL*
arm-chair
,
and
crossing
her
left
knee
with
her
right
,
which
formed
a
*NL*
resting-place
for
her
elbow
,
she
reclin
'd
her
cheek
upon
the
palm
of
her
*NL*
hand
,
and
leaning
forwards
,
ruminated
till
midnight
upon
both
sides
of
*NL*
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
night
she
went
to
her
bureau
,
and
having
ordered
Bridget
to
*NL*
bring
her
up
a
couple
of
fresh
candles
and
leave
them
upon
the
table
,
*NL*
she
took
out
her
marriage-settlement
,
and
read
it
over
with
great
*NL*
devotion
:
and
the
third
night
-LRB-
which
was
the
last
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
stay
-RRB-
when
Bridget
had
pull
'd
down
the
night-shift
,
and
was
assaying
to
*NL*
stick
in
the
corking
pin
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
With
a
kick
of
both
heels
at
once
,
but
at
the
same
time
the
*NL*
most
natural
kick
that
could
be
kick
'd
in
her
situation
--
for
*NL*
supposing
...
...
to
be
the
sun
in
its
meridian
,
it
was
a
north-east
*NL*
kick
--
she
kick
'd
the
pin
out
of
her
fingers
--
the
etiquette
which
hung
*NL*
upon
it
,
down
--
down
it
fell
to
the
ground
,
and
was
shiver
'd
into
a
*NL*
thousand
atoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
all
which
it
was
plain
that
widow
Wadman
was
in
love
with
my
uncle

Toby

This
is
not
a
distinction
without
a
difference
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
like
the
affair
of
an
old
hat
cock

--
and
a
cock
'd
old
*NL*
hat
,
about
which
your
reverences
have
so
often
been
at
odds
with
one
*NL*
another
--
but
there
is
a
difference
here
in
the
nature
of
things

*NL*

And
let
me
tell
you

gentry

a
wide
one
too

Now
as
widow
Wadman
did
love
my
uncle
Toby
--
and
my
uncle
Toby
did
not
*NL*
love
widow
Wadman
,
there
was
nothing
for
widow
Wadman
to
do
,
but
to
go
*NL*
on
and
love
my
uncle
Toby
--
or
let
it
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Widow
Wadman
would
do
neither
the
one
or
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Gracious
heaven
!
--
but
I
forget
I
am
a
little
of
her
temper
myself
;
for
*NL*
whenever
it
so
falls
out
,
which
it
sometimes
does
about
the
equinoxes
,
*NL*
that
an
earthly
goddess
is
so
much
this
,
and
that
,
and
t
`
other
,
that
I
*NL*
can
not
eat
my
breakfast
for
her
--
and
that
she
careth
not
three
halfpence
*NL*
whether
I
eat
my
breakfast
or
no
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Curse
on
her
!
and
so
I
send
her
to
Tartary
,
and
from
Tartary
to
Terra
*NL*
del
Fuogo
,
and
so
on
to
the
devil
:
in
short
,
there
is
not
an
infernal
*NL*
nitch
where
I
do
not
take
her
divinityship
and
stick
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
the
heart
is
tender
,
and
the
passions
in
these
tides
ebb
and
flow
*NL*
ten
times
in
a
minute
,
I
instantly
bring
her
back
again
;
and
as
I
do
all
*NL*
things
in
extremes
,
I
place
her
in
the
very
center
of
the
milky-way
--
*NL*
*NL*
Brightest
of
stars
!
thou
wilt
shed
thy
influence
upon
some
one
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
duce
take
her
and
her
influence
too
--
for
at
that
word
I
lose
all
*NL*
patience
--
much
good
may
it
do
him
!
--
By
all
that
is
hirsute
and
gashly
!
I
*NL*
cry
,
taking
off
my
furr
'd
cap
,
and
twisting
it
round
my
finger
--
I
would
*NL*
not
give
sixpence
for
a
dozen
such
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
't
is
an
excellent
cap
too
-LRB-
putting
it
upon
my
head
,
and
pressing
*NL*
it
close
to
my
ears
-RRB-
--
and
warm
--
and
soft
;
especially
if
you
stroke
*NL*
it
the
right
way
--
but
alas
!
that
will
never
be
my
luck
--
-LRB-
so
here
my
*NL*
philosophy
is
shipwreck
'd
again
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
;
I
shall
never
have
a
finger
in
the
pye
-LRB-
so
here
I
break
my
*NL*
metaphor
-RRB-
--
Crust
and
Crumb
*NL*
Inside
and
out
*NL*
*NL*
Top
and
bottom
--
I
detest
it
,
I
hate
it
,
I
repudiate
it
--
I
'm
sick
at
the
*NL*
sight
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
'T

by

who
does
nothing

I
*NL*
think
,
from
morning
to
night
,
but
sit
down
by
the
fire-side
and
invent
*NL*
inflammatory

I
would
not

my

once
told
my

Toby
upon
the
close
of
a
*NL*
long
dissertation
upon
the
subject
--
`
You

said

,
`
combine
*NL*

upon

cried
my

Toby

*NL*
*NL*
Nothing

quoth
my
father
,
but
to
get
in

let
it

*NL*
*NL*
Now
widow

as
I
told

The
Fates
,
who
certainly
all
fore-knew
of
these
amours
of
widow
Wadman
*NL*
and
my
uncle
Toby
,
had
,
from
the
first
creation
of
matter
and
motion
*NL*
-LRB-
and
with
more
courtesy
than
they
usually
do
things
of
this
kind
-RRB-
,
*NL*
established
such
a
chain
of
causes
and
effects
hanging
so
fast
to
one
*NL*
another
,
that
it
was
scarce
possible
for
my
uncle
Toby
to
have
dwelt
in
*NL*
any
other
house
in
the
world
,
or
to
have
occupied
any
other
garden
*NL*
in
Christendom
,
but
the
very
house
and
garden
which
join
'd
and
laid
*NL*
parallel
to
Mrs.
Wadman
's
;
this
,
with
the
advantage
of
a
thickset
*NL*
arbour
in
Mrs.
Wadman
's
garden
,
but
planted
in
the
hedge-row
of
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
,
put
all
the
occasions
into
her
hands
which
Love-militancy
*NL*
wanted
;
she
could
observe
my
uncle
Toby
's
motions
,
and
was
mistress
*NL*
likewise
of
his
councils
of
war
;
and
as
his
unsuspecting
heart
had
given
*NL*
leave
to
the
corporal
,
through
the
mediation
of
Bridget
,
to
make
her
*NL*
a
wicker-gate
of
communication
to
enlarge
her
walks
,
it
enabled
her
*NL*
to
carry
on
her
approaches
to
the
very
door
of
the
sentry-box
;
and
*NL*
sometimes
out
of
gratitude
,
to
make
an
attack
,
and
endeavour
to
blow
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
up
in
the
very
sentry-box
itself

It
is
a
great
pity
--
but
't
is
certain
from
every
day
's
observation
of
*NL*
man
,
that
he
may
be
set
on
fire
like
a
candle
,
at
either
end
--
provided
*NL*
there
is
a
sufficient
wick
standing
out
;
if
there
is
not
--
there
's
an
*NL*
end
of
the
affair
;
and
if
there
is
--
by
lighting
it
at
the
bottom
,
as
*NL*
the
flame
in
that
case
has
the
misfortune
generally
to
put
out
*NL*
itself
--
there
's
an
end
of
the
affair
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
part
,
could
I
always
have
the
ordering
of
it
which
way
I
would
*NL*
be
burnt
myself
--
for
I
can
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
being
burnt
like
a
*NL*
beast
--
I
would
oblige
a
housewife
constantly
to
light
me
at
the
top
;
for
*NL*
then
I
should
burn
down
decently
to
the
socket
;
that
is
,
from
my
head
to
*NL*
my
heart
,
from
my
heart
to
my
liver
,
from
my
liver
to
my
bowels
,
and
*NL*
so
on
by
the
meseraick
veins
and
arteries
,
through
all
the
turns
and
*NL*
lateral
insertions
of
the
intestines
and
their
tunicles
to
the
blind
*NL*
gut
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
beseech
you
,
doctor
Slop
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
interrupting
him
as
*NL*
he
mentioned
the
blind
gut
,
in
a
discourse
with
my
father
the
night
my
*NL*
mother
was
brought
to
bed
of
me
--
I
beseech
you
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
*NL*
tell
me
which
is
the
blind
gut
;
for
,
old
as
I
am
,
I
vow
I
do
not
know
to
*NL*
this
day
where
it
lies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blind
gut
,
answered
doctor
Slop
,
lies
betwixt
the
Ilion
and
Colon
--
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
man
?
said
my
father

*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
precisely
the
same
,
cried
doctor
Slop
,
in
a

's
more
than
I
know

And
so
to
make
sure
of
both
systems
,
Mrs.
Wadman
predetermined
to
*NL*
light
my
uncle
Toby
neither
at
this
end
or
that
;
but
,
like
a
prodigal
's
*NL*
candle
,
to
light
him
,
if
possible
,
at
both
ends
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
through
all
the
lumber
rooms
of
military
furniture
,
including
both
*NL*
of
horse
and
foot
,
from
the
great
arsenal
of
Venice
to
the
Tower
of
*NL*
London
-LRB-
exclusive
-RRB-
,
if
Mrs.
Wadman
had
been
rummaging
for
seven
years
*NL*
together
,
and
with
Bridget
to
help
her
,
she
could
not
have
found
any
one
*NL*
blind
or
mantelet
so
fit
for
her
purpose
,
as
that
which
the
expediency
*NL*
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
affairs
had
fix
'd
up
ready
to
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
believe
I
have
not
told
you
--
but
I
do
n't
know
--
possibly
I
have
--
be
it
*NL*
as
it
will
,
't
is
one
of
the
number
of
those
many
things
,
which
a
man
*NL*
had
better
do
over
again
,
than
dispute
about
it
--
That
whatever
town
*NL*
or
fortress
the
corporal
was
at
work
upon
,
during
the
course
of
*NL*
their
campaign
,
my
uncle
Toby
always
took
care
,
on
the
inside
of
his
*NL*
sentry-box
,
which
was
towards
his
left
hand
,
to
have
a
plan
of
the
*NL*
place
,
fasten
'd
up
with
two
or
three
pins
at
the
top
,
but
loose
at
*NL*
the
bottom
,
for
the
conveniency
of
holding
it
up
to
the
eye
,
&
c.
.
.
as
*NL*
occasions
required
;
so
that
when
an
attack
was
resolved
upon
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Wadman
had
nothing
more
to
do
,
when
she
had
got
advanced
to
the
door
*NL*
of
the
sentry-box
,
but
to
extend
her
right
hand
;
and
edging
in
her
left
*NL*
foot
at
the
same
movement
,
to
take
hold
of
the
map
or
plan
,
or
upright
,
*NL*
or
whatever
it
was
,
and
with
out-stretched
neck
meeting
it
half
way
,
--
to
*NL*
advance
it
towards
her
;
on
which
my
uncle
Toby
's
passions
were
sure
to
*NL*
catch
fire
--
for
he
would
instantly
take
hold
of
the
other
corner
of
the
*NL*
map
in
his
left
hand
,
and
with
the
end
of
his
pipe
in
the
other
,
begin
*NL*
an
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
attack
was
advanced
to
this
point
;
--
the
world
will
*NL*
naturally
enter
into
the
reasons
of
Mrs.
Wadman
's
next
stroke
of
*NL*
generalship
--
which
was
,
to
take
my
uncle
Toby
's
tobacco-pipe
out
of
his
*NL*
hand
as
soon
as
she
possibly
could
;
which
,
under
one
pretence
or
other
,
*NL*
but
generally
that
of
pointing
more
distinctly
at
some
redoubt
or
*NL*
breastwork
in
the
map
,
she
would
effect
before
my
uncle
Toby
-LRB-
poor
*NL*
soul
!
-RRB-
had
well
march
'd
above
half
a
dozen
toises
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
obliged
my
uncle
Toby
to
make
use
of
his
forefinger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
difference
it
made
in
the
attack
was
this
;
That
in
going
upon
it
,
as
*NL*
in
the
first
case
,
with
the
end
of
her
fore-finger
against
the
end
of
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
tobacco-pipe
,
she
might
have
travelled
with
it
,
along
the
*NL*
lines
,
from
Dan
to
Beersheba
,
had
my
uncle
Toby
's
lines
reach
'd
so
far
,
*NL*
without
any
effect
:
For
as
there
was
no
arterial
or
vital
heat
in
the
*NL*
end
of
the
tobacco-pipe
,
it
could
excite
no
sentiment
--
it
could
neither
*NL*
give
fire
by
pulsation
--
or
receive
it
by
sympathy
--
't
was
nothing
but
*NL*
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whereas
,
in
following
my
uncle
Toby
's
forefinger
with
hers
,
close
thro
'
*NL*
all
the
little
turns
and
indentings
of
his
works
--
pressing
sometimes
*NL*
against
the
side
of
it
--
then
treading
upon
its
nail
--
then
tripping
it
*NL*
up
--
then
touching
it
here
--
then
there
,
and
so
on
--
it
set
something
at
*NL*
least
in
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
tho
'
slight
skirmishing
,
and
at
a
distance
from
the
main
body
,
yet
*NL*
drew
on
the
rest
;
for
here
,
the
map
usually
falling
with
the
back
of
it
,
*NL*
close
to
the
side
of
the
sentry-box
,
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
the
simplicity
*NL*
of
his
soul
,
would
lay
his
hand
flat
upon
it
,
in
order
to
go
on
with
his
*NL*
explanation
;
and
Mrs.
Wadman
,
by
a
manoeuvre
as
quick
as
thought
,
*NL*
would
as
certainly
place
her
's
close
beside
it
;
this
at
once
opened
a
*NL*
communication
,
large
enough
for
any
sentiment
to
pass
or
re-pass
,
which
*NL*
a
person
skill
'd
in
the
elementary
and
practical
part
of
love-making
,
*NL*
has
occasion

unavoidably

*NL*
Thine
,
dear
uncle
Toby

was
never
now
in

right
place
--
Mrs.
Wadman
*NL*
had
it
ever
to
take
up
,
or
,
with
the
gentlest
pushings
,
protrusions
,
*NL*
and
equivocal
compressions
,
that
a
hand
to
be
removed
is
capable
of
*NL*
receiving
--
to
get
it
press
'd
a
hair
breadth
of
one
side
out
of
her
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
this
was
doing
,
how
could
she
forget
to
make
him
sensible
,
that
*NL*
it
was
her
leg
-LRB-
and
no
one
's
else
-RRB-
at
the
bottom
of
the
sentry-box
,
*NL*
which
slightly
press
'd
against
the
calf
of
his
--
So
that
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
being
thus
attack
'd
and
sore
push
'd
on
both
his
wings
--
was
it
a
wonder
,
*NL*
if
now
and
then
,
it
put
his
centre
into
disorder

*NL*
*NL*
These
attacks
of
Mrs.
Wadman
,
you
will
readily
conceive
to
be
of
*NL*
different
kinds
;
varying
from
each
other
,
like
the
attacks
which
history
*NL*
is
full
of
,
and
from
the
same
reasons
.
A
general
looker-on
would
scarce
*NL*
allow
them
to
be
attacks
at
all
--
or
if
he
did
,
would
confound
them
all
*NL*
together
--
but
I
write
not
to
them
:
it
will
be
time
enough
to
be
a
little
*NL*
more
exact
in
my
descriptions
of
them
,
as
I
come
up
to
them
,
which
will
*NL*
not
be
for
some
chapters
;
having
nothing
more
to
add
in
this
,
but
that
*NL*
in
a
bundle
of
original
papers
and
drawings
which
my
father
took
care
*NL*
to
roll
up
by
themselves
,
there
is
a
plan
of
Bouchain
in
perfect
*NL*
preservation
-LRB-
and
shall
be
kept
so
,
whilst
I
have
power
to
preserve
any
*NL*
thing
-RRB-
,
upon
the
lower
corner
of
which
,
on
the
right
hand
side
,
there
is
*NL*
still
remaining
the
marks
of
a
snuffy
finger
and
thumb
,
which
there
*NL*
is
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
imagine
,
were
Mrs.
Wadman
's
;
for
*NL*
the
opposite
side
of
the
margin
,
which
I
suppose
to
have
been
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
's
,
is
absolutely
clean
:
This
seems
an
authenticated
record
of
one
*NL*
of
these
attacks
;
for
there
are
vestigia
of
the
two
punctures
partly
*NL*
grown
up
,
but
still
visible
on
the
opposite
corner
of
the
map
,
which
are
*NL*
unquestionably
the
very
holes
,
through
which
it
has
been
pricked
up
in
*NL*
the
sentry-box
--
*NL*
*NL*
By
all
that
is
priestly
!
I
value
this
precious
relick
,
with
its
stigmata
*NL*
and
pricks
,
more
than
all
the
relicks
of
the
Romish
church
--
always
*NL*
excepting
,
when
I
am
writing
upon
these
matters
,
the
pricks
which
*NL*
entered
the
flesh
of
St.
Radagunda
in
the
desert
,
which
in
your
road
*NL*
from
Fesse
to
Cluny
,
the
nuns
of
that
name
will
shew
you
for
love
.

I
think

an
'
please
your

,
quoth
Trim
,
the
fortifications
are
*NL*
quite
destroyed
--
and
the
bason
is
upon
a
level
with
the
mole
--
I
think
*NL*
so
too
;
replied
my
uncle
Toby
with
a
sigh
half
suppress
'd
--
but
step
into
*NL*
the
parlour
,
Trim
,
for
the
stipulation
--
it
lies
upon
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
lain
there
these
six
weeks
,
replied
the
corporal
,
till
this
very
*NL*
morning
that
the
old
woman
kindled
the
fire
with
it
--
*NL*
*NL*

Then
,
said
my

Toby
,
there
is
no
further
occasion
for
our
*NL*
services
.
The
more
,
an
'
please

,
the
pity
,
said
the
corporal
;
*NL*
in
uttering
which
he
cast
his
spade
into
the
wheel-barrow
,
which
was
*NL*
beside
him
,
with
an
air
the
most
expressive
of
disconsolation
that
can
*NL*
be
imagined
,
and
was
heavily
turning
about
to
look
for
his
pickax
,
his
*NL*
pioneer
's
shovel
,
his
picquets
,
and
other
little
military
stores
,
in
*NL*
order
to
carry
them
off
the
field
--
when
a
heigh-ho
!
from
the
sentry-box
,
*NL*
which
being
made
of
thin
slit
deal
,
reverberated
the
sound
more
*NL*
sorrowfully
to
his
ear
,
forbad
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
No
;
said
the
corporal
to
himself
,
I
'll
do
it
before
his
honour
rises
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
;
so
taking
his
spade
out
of
the
wheel-barrow
again
,
*NL*
with
a
little
earth
in
it
,
as
if
to
level
something
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
glacis
--
but
with
a
real
intent
to
approach
nearer
to
his
master
,
in
*NL*
order
to
divert
him
--
he
loosen
'd
a
sod
or
two
--
pared
their
edges
with
*NL*
his
spade
,
and
having
given
them
a
gentle
blow
or
two
with
the
back
*NL*
of
it
,
he
sat
himself
down
close
by
my

Toby

feet

began
as

It

pities

though
I
believe
,
an
'

your

I
am

going
to

a

kind
of

for

A

cried
my

,
interrupting
the

,
is
no
more
*NL*
exempt
from
saying
a

Trim

than
a
man
of

But
not

so
often
,
an

replied
the
corporal
--
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
gave
a
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
thousand
pities
then
,
said
the
corporal
,
casting
his
eye
upon
*NL*
Dunkirk
,
and
the
mole
,
as
Servius
Sulpicius
,
in
returning
out
of
Asia
*NL*
-LRB-
when
he
sailed
from
Aegina
towards
Megara
-RRB-
,
did
upon
Corinth
and

Pyreus
--
*NL*
*NL*

`
It
was

,

to
destroy
these

pities
to

let

--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thou
art
right
,
Trim
,
in
both
cases
;
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
--
This
,
*NL*
continued
the
corporal
,
is
the
reason
,
that
from
the
beginning
of
their
*NL*
demolition
to
the
end
--
I
have
never
once
whistled
,
or
sung
,
or
laugh
'd
,
*NL*
or
cry
'd
,
or
talk
'd
of

done
deeds

told
your
honour
one
story
*NL*
good
or
bad
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Thou
hast
many
excellencies
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
I
hold
it
*NL*
not
the
least
of
them
,
as
thou
happenest
to
be
a
story-teller
,
that
of
*NL*
the
number
thou
hast
told
me
,
either
to
amuse
me
in
my
painful
hours
,
or
*NL*
divert
me
in
my
grave
ones
--
thou
hast
seldom
told
me
a
bad
one
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Because
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
except
one
of
a
King
of
Bohemia
and
*NL*
his
seven
castles
,
--
they
are
all
true
;
for
they
are
about
myself
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
like
the
subject
the
worse
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
on
that
*NL*
score
:
But
prithee
what
is
this
story
?
thou
hast
excited
my
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
'll
tell
it
your
honour
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
directly
--
Provided
,
*NL*
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
earnestly
towards
Dunkirk
and
the
mole
*NL*
again
--
provided
it
is
not
a
merry
one
;
to
such
,
Trim
,
a
man
should
ever
*NL*
bring
one
half
of
the
entertainment
along
with
him
;
and
the
disposition
*NL*
I
am
in
at
present
would
wrong
both
thee
,
Trim
,
and
thy
story
--
It
is
*NL*
not
a
merry
one
by
any
means
,
replied
the
corporal
--
Nor
would
I
have
it
*NL*
altogether
a
grave
one
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
--
It
is
neither
the
one
nor
*NL*
the
other
,
replied
the
corporal
,
but
will
suit
your
honour
exactly
--
Then
*NL*
I
'll
thank
thee
for
it
with
all
my
heart
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
;
so
*NL*
prithee
begin
it
,
Trim
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
made
his
reverence
;
and
though
it
is
not
so
easy
a
matter
*NL*
as
the
world
imagines
,
to
pull
off
a
lank
Montero-cap
with
grace
--
or
a
*NL*
whit
less
difficult
,
in
my
conceptions
,
when
a
man
is
sitting
squat
upon
*NL*
the
ground
,
to
make
a
bow
so
teeming
with
respect
as
the
corporal
was
*NL*
wont
;
yet
by
suffering
the
palm
of
his
right
hand
,
which
was
towards
his
*NL*
master
,
to
slip
backwards
upon
the
grass
,
a
little
beyond
his
body
,
in
*NL*
order
to
allow
it
the
greater
sweep
--
and
by
an
unforced
compression
,
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
of
his
cap
with
the
thumb
and
the
two
forefingers
of
his
*NL*
left
,
by
which
the
diameter
of
the
cap
became
reduced
,
so
that
it
*NL*
might
be
said
,
rather
to
be
insensibly
squeez
'd
--
than
pull
'd
off
with
a
*NL*
flatus
--
the
corporal
acquitted
himself
of
both
in
a
better
manner
than
*NL*
the
posture
of
his
affairs
promised
;
and
having
hemmed
twice
,
to
find
in
*NL*
what
key
his
story
would
best
go
,
and
best
suit
his
master
's
humour
,
--
he
*NL*
exchanged
a
single
look
of
kindness
with
him
,
and
set
off
thus

There

he
--
As
the
corporal
was
entering
the
*NL*
confines
of
Bohemia
,
my
uncle
Toby
obliged
him
to
halt
for
a
single
*NL*
moment
;
he
had
set
out
bare-headed
,
having
,
since
he
pull
'd
off
his
*NL*
Montero-cap
in
the
latter
end
of
the
last
chapter
,
left
it
lying
beside
*NL*
him
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
eye
of
Goodness
espieth
all
things
--
so
that
before
the
corporal
*NL*
had
well
got
through
the
first
five
words
of
his
story
,
had
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
twice
touch
'd
his
Montero-cap
with
the
end
of
his
cane
,
*NL*
interrogatively
--
as
much
as
to
say
,
Why
do
n't
you
put
it
on
,
Trim
?
Trim
*NL*
took
it
up
with
the
most
respectful
slowness
,
and
casting
a
glance
of
*NL*
humiliation
as
he
did
it
,
upon
the
embroidery
of
the
fore-part
,
which
*NL*
being
dismally
tarnish
'd
and
fray
'd
moreover
in
some
of
the
principal
*NL*
leaves
and
boldest
parts
of
the
pattern
,
he
lay
'd
it
down
again
between
*NL*
his
two
feet
,
in
order
to
moralize
upon
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
every
word
of
it
but
too
true
,
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
thou
art
*NL*
about
to
observe
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
in
this
world
,
Trim
,
is
made
to
last
for
ever
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
when
tokens
,
dear
Tom
,
of
thy
love
and
remembrance
wear
out
,
said
*NL*
Trim
,
what
shall
we
say
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
occasion
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
to
say
any
thing
else
;
*NL*
and
was
a
man
to
puzzle
his
brains
till
Doom
's
day
,
I
believe
,
Trim
,
it
*NL*
would
be
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
,
perceiving
my
uncle
Toby
was
in
the
right
,
and
that
it
*NL*
would
be
in
vain
for
the
wit
of
man
to
think
of
extracting
a
purer
moral
*NL*
from
his
cap
,
without
further
attempting
it
,
he
put
it
on
;
and
passing
*NL*
his
hand
across
his
forehead
to
rub
out
a
pensive
wrinkle
,
which
the
*NL*
text
and
the
doctrine
between
them
had
engender
'd
,
he
return
'd
,
with
the
*NL*
same
look
and
tone
of
voice
,
to
his
story
of
the
king
of

the

himself

I

tell
you
plainly
it
was

from
a
different
reason
than
you
wot
of

It

To

Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
any
other
date
would
*NL*
have
pleased
me
much
better
,
not
only
on
account
of
the
sad
stain
upon
*NL*
our
history
that
year
,
in
marching
off
our
troops
,
and
refusing
to
cover
*NL*
the
siege
of
Quesnoi
,
though
Fagel
was
carrying
on
the
works
with
such
*NL*
incredible
vigour
--
but
likewise
on
the
score
,
Trim
,
of
thy

;
*NL*
because
if
there
are

and
which
,
from
what
thou
hast
dropt
,
I
partly
*NL*
suspect
to
be
the
fact

if

in

*NL*
There

'T
is
as

as

replied
my

Toby

thou
should

have
*NL*
carried
him
back
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
years
out
of

,
*NL*
both
of

thee

it
again

said
my

but
with
accents
of
such
sweet
*NL*
encouragement
did
he
utter
it
,
that
the

went

Leave

leaning

laying
his

gently
upon

to

Right

answered
my

it

not

,
Trim

for

thou

I

who
seldom
looks

to

the

of
his

,
or
backwards
beyond
his
knapsack
,
to
know
much
*NL*
about
this

God
bless
your

said
the
corporal
,
won
by
the
*NL*
manner
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
reasoning
,
as
much
as
by
the
reasoning
itself
,
*NL*
he
has
something
else
to
do
;
if
not
on
action

upon

in

himself

so

added
the

triumphantly

has

*NL*
--
Thou
would
`

have
said
chronology
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
;
for
*NL*
as
for
geography
,
't
is
of
absolute
use
to
him
;
he
must
be
acquainted
*NL*
intimately
with
every
country
and
its
boundaries
where
his
profession
*NL*
carries
him
;
he
should
know
every
town
and
city
,
and
village
and
hamlet
,
*NL*
with
the
canals
,
the
roads
,
and
hollow
ways
which
lead
up
to
them
;
there
*NL*
is
not
a
river
or
a
rivulet
he
passes
,
Trim
,
but
he
should
be
able
at
*NL*
first
sight
to
tell
thee
what
is
its
name
--
in
what
mountains
it
*NL*
takes
its
rise
--
what
is
its
course
--
how
far
it
is
navigable
--
where
*NL*
fordable
--
where
not
;
he
should
know
the
fertility
of
every
valley
,
as
*NL*
well
as
the
hind
who
ploughs
it
;
and
be
able
to
describe
,
or
,
if
it
is
*NL*
required
,
to
give
thee
an
exact
map
of
all
the
plains
and
defiles
,
the
*NL*
forts
,
the
acclivities
,
the
woods
and
morasses
,
thro
'
and
by
which
his
*NL*
army
is
to
march
;
he
should
know
their
produce
,
their
plants
,
their
*NL*
minerals
,
their
waters
,
their
animals
,
their
seasons
,
their

*NL*
their

their

their

their

*NL*
Is
it
else
to
be
conceived

corporal
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
rising
*NL*
up
in
his
sentry-box
,
as
he
began
to
warm
in
this
part
of
his
*NL*
discourse
--
how
Marlborough
could
have
marched
his
army
from
the
banks
of
*NL*
the
Maes
to
Belburg
;
from
Belburg
to
Kerpenord
--
-LRB-
here
the
corporal
*NL*
could
sit
no
longer
-RRB-
from
Kerpenord
,
Trim
,
to
Kalsaken
;
from
Kalsaken
*NL*
to
Newdorf
;
from
Newdorf
to
Landenbourg
;
from
Landenbourg
to
Mildenheim
;
*NL*
from
Mildenheim
to
Elchingen
;
from
Elchingen
to
Gingen
;
from
Gingen
to
*NL*
Balmerchoffen
;
from
Balmerchoffen
to
Skellenburg
,
where
he
broke
in
*NL*
upon
the
enemy
's
works
;
forced
his
passage
over
the
Danube
;
cross
'd
the
*NL*
Lech
--
push
'd
on
his
troops
into
the
heart
of
the
empire
,
marching
at
the
*NL*
head
of
them
through
Fribourg
,
Hokenwert
,
and
Schonevelt
,
to
the
plains
*NL*
of
Blenheim
and
Hochstet
?
--
Great
as
he
was
,
corporal
,
he
could
not
have
*NL*
advanced
a
step
,
or
made
one
single
day
's
march
without
the
aids
of
*NL*
Geography
.
--
As
for
Chronology
,
I
own
,
Trim
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
sitting
down
again
coolly
in
his
sentry-box
,
that
of
all
others
,
it
*NL*
seems
a
science
which
the
soldier
might
best
spare
,
was
it
not
for
the
*NL*
lights
which
that
science
must
one
day
give
him
,
in
determining
the
*NL*
invention
of
powder
;
the
furious
execution
of
which
,
renversing
every
*NL*
thing
like
thunder
before
it
,
has
become
a
new
aera
to
us
of
military
*NL*
improvements
,
changing
so
totally
the
nature
of
attacks
and
defences
*NL*
both
by
sea
and
land
,
and
awakening
so
much
art
and
skill
in
doing
it
,
*NL*
that
the
world
can
not
be
too
exact
in
ascertaining
the
precise
time
*NL*
of
its
discovery
,
or
too
inquisitive
in
knowing
what
great
man
was
the
*NL*
discoverer
,
and
what
occasions
gave
birth
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
far
from
controverting
,
continued
my
uncle
Toby
,
what
historians
*NL*
agree
in
,
that
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
1380
,
under
the
reign
of
*NL*
Wencelaus
,
son
of
Charles
the
Fourth
--
a
certain
priest
,
whose
name
*NL*
was
Schwartz
,
shew
'd
the
use
of
powder
to
the
Venetians
,
in
their
wars
*NL*
against
the
Genoese
;
but
't
is
certain
he
was
not
the
first
;
because
if
*NL*
we
are
to
believe
Don
Pedro
,
the
bishop
of
Leon
--
How
came
priests
and
*NL*
bishops
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
to
trouble
their
heads
so
much
about
*NL*
gun-powder
?
God
knows
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
his
providence
brings
good
*NL*
out
of
every
thing
--
and
he
avers
,
in
his
chronicle
of
King
Alphonsus
,
*NL*
who
reduced
Toledo
,
That
in
the
year
1343
,
which
was
full
thirty-seven
*NL*
years
before
that
time
,
the
secret
of
powder
was
well
known
,
and
*NL*
employed
with
success
,
both
by
Moors
and
Christians
,
not
only
in
their
*NL*
sea-combats
,
at
that
period
,
but
in
many
of
their
most
memorable
sieges
*NL*
in
Spain
and
Barbary
--
And
all
the
world
knows
,
that
Friar
Bacon
had
*NL*
wrote
expressly
about
it
,
and
had
generously
given
the
world
a
receipt
*NL*
to
make
it
by
,
above
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
before
even
Schwartz
was
*NL*
born
--
And
that
the
Chinese
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
embarrass
us
,
and
all
*NL*
accounts
of
it
,
still
more
,
by
boasting
of
the
invention
some
hundreds
*NL*
of
years
even
before
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
They
are
a
pack
of
liars
,
I
believe
,
cried
Trim
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
are
somehow
or
other
deceived
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
this
*NL*
matter
,
as
is
plain
to
me
from
the
present
miserable
state
of
military
*NL*
architecture
amongst
them
;
which
consists
of
nothing
more
than
a
fosse
*NL*
with
a
brick
wall
without
flanks
--
and
for
what
they
gave
us
as
a
bastion
*NL*
at
each
angle
of
it
,
't
is
so
barbarously
constructed
,
that
it
looks
for
*NL*
all
the
world
--
Like
one
of
my
seven
castles
,
an
'
please
your
honour

*NL*
quoth
Trim
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
,
tho
'
in
the
utmost
distress
for
a
comparison
,
most
*NL*
courteously
refused
Trim
's
offer
--
till
Trim
telling
him
,
he
had
half
a
*NL*
dozen
more
in
Bohemia
,
which
he
knew
not
how
to
get
off
his
hands
--
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
was
so
touch
'd
with
the
pleasantry
of
heart
of
the
*NL*
corporal
--
that
he
discontinued
his
dissertation
upon
gun-powder
--
and
*NL*
begged
the
corporal
forthwith
to
go
on
with
his
story
of
the
King
of

Bohemia
and
his

This
unfortunate
King
of
Bohemia
,
said
Trim
,
--
Was
he
unfortunate
,
then
?
*NL*
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
for
he
had
been
so
wrapt
up
in
his
dissertation
*NL*
upon
gun-powder
,
and
other
military
affairs
,
that
tho
'
he
had
desired
*NL*
the
corporal
to
go
on
,
yet
the
many
interruptions
he
had
given
,
dwelt
*NL*
not
so
strong
upon
his
fancy
as
to
account
for
the
epithet
--
Was
he
*NL*
unfortunate
,
then
,
Trim
?
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
pathetically
--
The
corporal
,
*NL*
wishing
first
the
word
and
all
its
synonimas
at
the
devil
,
forthwith
*NL*
began
to
run
back
in
his
mind
,
the
principal
events
in
the
King
of
*NL*
Bohemia
's
story
;
from
every
one
of
which
,
it
appearing
that
he
was
the
*NL*
most
fortunate
man
that
ever
existed
in
the
world
--
it
put
the
corporal
*NL*
to
a
stand
:
for
not
caring
to
retract
his
epithet
--
and
less
to
explain
*NL*
it
--
and
least
of
all
,
to
twist
his
tale
-LRB-
like
men
of
lore
-RRB-
to
serve
a
*NL*
system
--
he
looked
up
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
face
for
assistance
--
but
seeing
*NL*
it
was
the
very
thing
my
uncle
Toby
sat
in
expectation
of
himself
--
after
*NL*
a
hum
and
a
haw
,
he
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
King
of
Bohemia
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
replied
the
corporal
,
*NL*
was
unfortunate
,
as
thus
--
That
taking
great
pleasure
and
delight
in
*NL*
navigation
and
all
sort
of
sea
affairs
--
and
there
happening
throughout
*NL*
the
whole
kingdom
of
Bohemia
,
to
be
no
sea-port
town
whatever
--
*NL*
*NL*
How
the
duce
should
there
--
Trim
?
cried
my
uncle
Toby
;
for
Bohemia
being
*NL*
totally
inland
,
it
could
have
happen
'd
no
otherwise
--
It
might
,
said
*NL*
Trim
,
if
it
had
pleased
God
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
never
spoke
of
the
being
and
natural
attributes
of
God
,
*NL*
but
with
diffidence
and
hesitation
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
believe
not
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
after
some
pause
--
for
being
*NL*
inland
,
as
I
said
,
and
having
Silesia
and
Moravia
to
the
east
;
Lusatia
*NL*
and
Upper
Saxony
to
the
north
;
Franconia
to
the
west
;
and
Bavaria
to
the
*NL*
south
;
Bohemia
could
not
have
been
propell
'd
to
the
sea
without
ceasing
*NL*
to
be
Bohemia
--
nor
could
the
sea
,
on
the
other
hand
,
have
come
up
to
*NL*
Bohemia
,
without
overflowing
a
great
part
of
Germany
,
and
destroying
*NL*
millions
of
unfortunate
inhabitants
who
could
make
no
defence
against
*NL*
it
--
Scandalous
!
cried
Trim
--
Which
would
bespeak
,
added
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
mildly
,
such
a
want
of
compassion
in
him
who
is
the
father
of
it
--
that
,
*NL*
I
think
,
Trim
--
the
thing
could
have
happen
'd
no
way
.
*NL*

The
corporal
made
the
bow
of
unfeign

conviction

and
went
on

Now
the

of

Aye

there
the

*NL*
Trim

cried
my

Toby
;
for
the
King
of
Bohemia

his
queen
might

have
walk

out

ordered
it

King
William
was
of
an
opinion
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
quoth
Trim
,
*NL*
that
every
thing
was
predestined
for
us
in
this
world
;
insomuch
,
that
*NL*
he
would
often
say
to
his
soldiers
,
that
`
every
ball
had
its
billet
.
'
He
*NL*
was
a
great
man
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
And
I
believe
,
continued
Trim
,
to
*NL*
this
day
,
that
the
shot
which
disabled
me
at
the
battle
of
Landen
,
*NL*
was
pointed
at
my
knee
for
no
other
purpose
,
but
to
take
me
out
of
his
*NL*
service
,
and
place
me
in
your
honour
's
,
where
I
should
be
taken
so
*NL*
much
better
care
of
in
my
old
age
--
It
shall
never
,
Trim
,
be
construed
*NL*
otherwise
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heart
,
both
of
the
master
and
the
man
,
were
alike
subject
to
sudden
*NL*
over-flowings
;
--
a
short
silence
ensued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
said
the
corporal
,
resuming
the
discourse
--
but
in
a
gayer
*NL*
accent
--
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
single
shot
,
I
had
never
,
`
an

*NL*
your
honour
,
been
in
love
--
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
thou
wast
once
in
love

Trim

said
my
uncle
Toby
,
smiling
--
*NL*
*NL*
Souse
!
replied
the
corporal
--
over
head
and
ears
!
an
'
please
your
honour
.
*NL*
Prithee
when
?
where
?
--
and
how
came
it
to
pass
?
--
I
never
heard
one
word
*NL*
of
it
before
;
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
:
--
I
dare
say
,
answered
Trim
,
that
*NL*
every
drummer
and
serjeant
's
son
in
the
regiment
knew
of
it
--
It
's
high
*NL*
time
I
should
--
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
honour
remembers
with
concern
,
said
the
corporal
,
the
total
rout
*NL*
and
confusion
of
our
camp
and
army
at
the
affair
of
Landen
;
every
one
*NL*
was
left
to
shift
for
himself
;
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
regiments
*NL*
of
Wyndham
,
Lumley
,
and
Galway
,
which
covered
the
retreat
over
the
*NL*
bridge
Neerspeeken
,
the
king
himself
could
scarce
have
gained
it
--
he
was
*NL*
press
'd
hard
,
as
your
honour
knows
,
on
every
side
of
him
--
*NL*
*NL*
Gallant
mortal
!
cried
my
uncle
Toby
,
caught
up
with
enthusiasm
--
this
*NL*
moment
,
now
that
all
is
lost
,
I
see
him
galloping
across
me
,
corporal
,
*NL*
to
the
left
,
to
bring
up
the
remains
of
the
English
horse
along
with
him
*NL*
to
support
the
right
,
and
tear
the
laurel
from
Luxembourg
's
brows
,
if
*NL*
yet
't
is
possible
--
I
see
him
with
the
knot
of
his
scarfe
just
shot
off
,
*NL*
infusing
fresh
spirits
into
poor
Galway
's
regiment
--
riding
along
the
*NL*
line
--
then
wheeling
about
,
and
charging
Conti
at
the
head
of
it
--
Brave
,
*NL*
brave
,
by
heaven
!
cried
my
uncle
Toby
--
he
deserves
a
crown
--
As
richly
,
*NL*
as
a
thief
a
halter
;
shouted
Trim
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
knew
the
corporal
's
loyalty
;
--
otherwise
the
comparison
*NL*
was
not
at
all
to
his
mind
--
it
did
not
altogether
strike
the
corporal
's
*NL*
fancy
when
he
had
made
it
--
but
it
could
not
be
recall
'd
--
so
he
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
,
but
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
number
of
wounded
was
prodigious
,
and
no
one
had
time
to
think
*NL*
of
any
thing
but
his
own
safety
--
Though
Talmash
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
brought
off
the
foot
with
great
prudence
--
But
I
was
left
upon
the
field
,
*NL*
said
the
corporal
.
Thou
wast
so
;
poor
fellow
!
replied
my
uncle
Toby
--
So
*NL*
that
it
was
noon
the
next
day
,
continued
the
corporal
,
before
I
was
*NL*
exchanged
,
and
put
into
a
cart
with
thirteen
or
fourteen
more
,
in
order
*NL*
to
be
convey
'd
to
our
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
part
of
the
body
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
where
a
wound
*NL*
occasions
more
intolerable
anguish
than
upon
the
knee
--
*NL*
*NL*
Except
the
groin
;
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
An
'
please
your
honour
,
replied
*NL*
the
corporal
,
the
knee
,
in
my
opinion
,
must
certainly
be
the
most
acute
,
*NL*
there
being
so
many
tendons
and
what-d'ye-call
-
'em
s
all
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
for
that
reason
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
the
groin
is
*NL*
infinitely
more
sensible
--
there
being
not
only
as
many
tendons
*NL*
and
what-d'ye-call
-
'em
s
-LRB-
for
I
know
their
names
as
little
as
thou
*NL*
dost
-RRB-
--
about
it
--
but
moreover
...
--
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wadman
,
who
had
been
all
the
time
in
her
arbour
--
instantly
stopp
'd
*NL*
her
breath
--
unpinn
'd
her
mob
at
the
chin
,
and
stood
upon
one
leg
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
dispute
was
maintained
with
amicable
and
equal
force
betwixt
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
and
Trim
for
some
time
;
till
Trim
at
length
recollecting
that
*NL*
he
had
often
cried
at
his
master
's
sufferings
,
but
never
shed
a
tear
*NL*
at
his
own
--
was
for
giving
up
the
point
,
which
my
uncle
Toby
would
not
*NL*
allow
--
'T
is
a
proof
of
nothing
,
Trim
,
said
he
,
but
the
generosity
of
thy
*NL*
temper
--
*NL*
*NL*
So
that
whether
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
groin
-LRB-
caeteris
paribus
-RRB-
is
*NL*
greater
than
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
knee
--
or
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
the
pain
of
a
wound
in
the
knee
is
not
greater
than
the
pain
of
*NL*
a
wound
in
the
groin

are
points
which
to
this
day
remain
unsettled

The
anguish
of
my
knee
,
continued
the
corporal
,
was
excessive
in
itself
;
*NL*
and
the
uneasiness
of
the
cart
,
with
the
roughness
of
the
roads
,
which
*NL*
were
terribly
cut
up
--
making
bad
still
worse
--
every
step
was
death
to
*NL*
me
:
so
that
with
the
loss
of
blood
,
and
the
want
of
care-taking
of
*NL*
me
,
and
a
fever
I
felt
coming
on
besides
--
-LRB-
Poor
soul
!
said
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
-RRB-
--
all
together
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
was
more
than
I
could
*NL*
sustain
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
telling
my
sufferings
to
a
young
woman
at
a
peasant
's
house
,
where
*NL*
our
cart
,
which
was
the
last
of
the
line
,
had
halted
;
they
had
help
'd
*NL*
me
in
,
and
the
young
woman
had
taken
a
cordial
out
of
her
pocket
and
*NL*
dropp
'd
it
upon
some
sugar
,
and
seeing
it
had
cheer
'd
me
,
she
had
given
*NL*
it
me
a
second
and
a
third
time
--
So
I
was
telling
her
,
an
'
please
your
*NL*
honour
,
the
anguish
I
was
in
,
and
was
saying
it
was
so
intolerable
*NL*
to
me
,
that
I
had
much
rather
lie
down
upon
the
bed
,
turning
my
face
*NL*
towards
one
which
was
in
the
corner
of
the
room
--
and
die
,
than
go
*NL*
on
--
when
,
upon
her
attempting
to
lead
me
to
it
,
I
fainted
away
in
her
*NL*
arms
.
She
was
a
good
soul
!
as
your
honour
,
said
the
corporal
,
wiping
his
*NL*
eyes
,
will
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
love
had
been
a
joyous
thing
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
the
most
serious
thing
,
an
'
please
your
honour
-LRB-
sometimes
-RRB-
,
that
is
*NL*
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
persuasion
of
the
young
woman
,
continued
the
corporal
,
the
cart
*NL*
with
the
wounded
men
set
off
without
me
:
she
had
assured
them
I
should
*NL*
expire
immediately
if
I
was
put
into
the
cart
.
So
when
I
came
to
*NL*
myself
--
I
found
myself
in
a
still
quiet
cottage
,
with
no
one
but
the
*NL*
young
woman
,
and
the
peasant
and
his
wife
.
I
was
laid
across
the
bed
in
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
room
,
with
my
wounded
leg
upon
a
chair
,
and
the
*NL*
young
woman
beside
me
,
holding
the
corner
of
her
handkerchief
dipp
'd
in
*NL*
vinegar
to
my
nose
with
one
hand
,
and
rubbing
my
temples
with
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
took
her
at
first
for
the
daughter
of
the
peasant
-LRB-
for
it
was
no
*NL*
inn
-RRB-
--
so
had
offer
'd
her
a
little
purse
with
eighteen
florins
,
which
my
*NL*
poor
brother
Tom
-LRB-
here
Trim
wip
'd
his
eyes
-RRB-
had
sent
me
as
a
token
,
by
a
*NL*
recruit
,
just
before
he
set
out
for
Lisbon
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
never
told
your
honour
that
piteous
story
yet
--
here
Trim
wiped
his
*NL*
eyes
a
third
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
call
'd
the
old
man
and
his
wife
into
the
room
,
to
shew
*NL*
them
the
money
,
in
order
to
gain
me
credit
for
a
bed
and
what
little
*NL*
necessaries
I
should
want
,
till
I
should
be
in
a
condition
to
be
got
to
*NL*
the
hospital
--
Come
then
!
said
she
,
tying
up
the
little
purse
--
I
'll
be
*NL*
your
banker
--
but
as
that
office
alone
will
not
keep
me
employ
'd
,
I
'll
be
*NL*
your
nurse
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
thought
by
her
manner
of
speaking
this
,
as
well
as
by
her
dress
,
which
*NL*
I
then
began
to
consider
more
attentively
--
that
the
young
woman
could
*NL*
not
be
the
daughter
of
the
peasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
black
down
to
her
toes
,
with
her
hair
conceal
'd
under
a
*NL*
cambric
border
,
laid
close
to
her
forehead
:
she
was
one
of
those
kind
of
*NL*
nuns
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
of
which
,
your
honour
knows
,
there
are
*NL*
a
good
many
in
Flanders
,
which
they
let
go
loose
--
By
thy
description
,
*NL*
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
dare
say
she
was
a
young
Beguine
,
of
*NL*
which
there
are
none
to
be
found
any
where
but
in
the
Spanish
*NL*
Netherlands
--
except
at
Amsterdam
--
they
differ
from
nuns
in
this
,
that
*NL*
they
can
quit
their
cloister
if
they
choose
to
marry
;
they
visit
and
*NL*
take
care
of
the
sick
by
profession
--
I
had
rather
,
for
my
own
part
,
they
*NL*
did
it
out
of
good-nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
She
often
told
me
,
quoth
Trim
,
she
did
it
for
the
love
of
Christ
--
I
*NL*
did
not
like
it
.
--
I
believe
,
Trim
,
we
are
both
wrong
,
said
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
--
we
'll
ask
Mr.
Yorick
about
it
to-night
at
my
brother
Shandy
's
--
so
*NL*
put
me
in
mind
;
added
my
uncle
Toby
.

*NL*
The
young
Beguine
,
continued
the
corporal
,
had
scarce
given
herself
time
*NL*
to
tell
me
`
she
would
be
my
nurse
,
'
when
she
hastily
turned
about
to
*NL*
begin
the
office
of
one
,
and
prepare
something
for
me
--
and
in
a
short
*NL*
time
--
though
I
thought
it
a
long
one
--
she
came
back
with
flannels
,
&
c.
*NL*
&
c.
and
having
fomented
my
knee
soundly
for
a
couple
of
hours
,
&
c.
and
*NL*
made
me
a
thin
bason
of
gruel
for
my
supper
--
she
wish
'd
me
rest
,
and
*NL*
promised
to
be
with
me
early
in
the
morning
.
--
She
wish
'd
me
,
an
'
*NL*
please
your
honour
,
what
was
not
to
be
had
.
My
fever
ran
very
high
that
*NL*
night
--
her
figure
made
sad
disturbance
within
me
--
I
was
every
moment
*NL*
cutting
the
world
in
two
--
to
give
her
half
of
it
--
and
every
moment
was
I
*NL*
crying
,
That
I
had
nothing
but
a
knapsack
and
eighteen
florins
to
share
*NL*
with
her
--
The
whole
night
long
was
the
fair
Beguine
,
like
an
angel
,
*NL*
close
by
my
bed-side
,
holding
back
my
curtain
and
offering
me
*NL*
cordials
--
and
I
was
only
awakened
from
my
dream
by
her
coming
there
at
*NL*
the
hour
promised
,
and
giving
them
in
reality
.
In
truth
,
she
was
scarce
*NL*
ever
from
me
;
and
so
accustomed
was
I
to
receive
life
from
her
hands
,
*NL*
that
my
heart
sickened
,
and
I
lost
colour
when
she
left
the
room
:
and
*NL*
yet
,
continued
the
corporal
-LRB-
making
one
of
the
strangest
reflections
*NL*
upon
it
in
the
world
-RRB-
--
`
It
was
not
love
'
--
for
during
the
three
weeks
*NL*
she
was
almost
constantly
with
me
,
fomenting
my
knee
with
her
hand
,
*NL*
night
and
day
--
I
can
honestly
say
,
an
'

that

once

*NL*
*NL*
That
was

I
prithee

quoth

inform

how

happened

With

*NL*
*NL*
I
had
escaped
,
continued
the
corporal
,
all
that
time
from
falling
*NL*
in
love
,
and
had
gone
on
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
,
had
it
not
been
*NL*
predestined
otherwise
--
there
is
no
resisting
our
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
a
Sunday
,
in
the
afternoon
,
as
I
told
your
honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
and
his
wife
had
walked
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
Every
thing
was
still
and
hush
as
midnight
about
the
house
--
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
not
so
much
as
a
duck
or
a
duckling
about
the
yard
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
When
the
fair
Beguine
came
in
to
see
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
wound
was
then
in
a
fair
way
of
doing
well
--
the
inflammation
had
been
*NL*
gone
off
for
some
time
,
but
it
was
succeeded
with
an
itching
both
above
*NL*
and
below
my
knee
,
so
insufferable
,
that
I
had
not
shut
my
eyes
the
*NL*
whole
night
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
me
see
it
,
said
she
,
kneeling
down
upon
the
ground
parallel
to
my
*NL*
knee
,
and
laying
her
hand
upon
the
part
below
it
--
it
only
wants
rubbing
*NL*
a
little
,
said
the
Beguine
;
so
covering
it
with
the
bed-clothes
,
she
*NL*
began
with
the
fore-finger
of
her
right
hand
to
rub
under
my
knee
,
*NL*
guiding
her
fore-finger
backwards
and
forwards
by
the
edge
of
the
*NL*
flannel
which
kept
on
the
dressing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
five
or
six
minutes
I
felt
slightly
the
end
of
her
second
finger
--
and
*NL*
presently
it
was
laid
flat
with
the
other
,
and
she
continued
rubbing
in
*NL*
that
way
round
and
round
for
a
good
while
;
it
then
came
into
my
head
,
*NL*
that
I
should
fall
in
love
--
I
blush
'd
when
I
saw
how
white
a
hand
she
*NL*
had
--
I
shall
never
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
behold
another
hand
so
white
*NL*
whilst
I
live
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
in
that
place
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
*NL*
*NL*
Though
it
was
the
most
serious
despair
in
nature
to
the
corporal
--
he
*NL*
could
not
forbear
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
Beguine
,
continued
the
corporal
,
perceiving
it
was
of
great
*NL*
service
to
me
--
from
rubbing
for
some
time
,
with
two
fingers
--
proceeded
*NL*
to
rub
at
length
,
with
three
--
till
by
little
and
little
she
brought
*NL*
down
the
fourth
,
and
then
rubb
'd
with
her
whole
hand
:
I
will
never
*NL*
say
another
word
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
upon
hands
again
--
but
it
was
*NL*
softer
than
sattin
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Prithee
,
Trim
,
commend
it
as
much
as
thou
wilt
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
;
*NL*
I
shall
hear
thy
story
with
the
more
delight
--
The
corporal
thank
'd
his
*NL*
master
most
unfeignedly
;
but
having
nothing
to
say
upon
the
Beguine
's
*NL*
hand
but
the
same
over
again
--
he
proceeded
to
the
effects
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fair
Beguine
,
said
the
corporal
,
continued
rubbing
with
her
whole
*NL*
hand
under
my
knee
--
till
I
fear
'd
her
zeal
would
weary
her
--
'
I
would
do
*NL*
a
thousand
times
more
,
'
said
she
,
`
for
the
love
of
Christ
'
--
In
saying
*NL*
which
,
she
pass
'd
her
hand
across
the
flannel
,
to
the
part
above
my
*NL*
knee
,
which
I
had
equally
complain
'd
of
,
and
rubb
'd
it
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
perceiv
'd
,
then
,
I
was
beginning
to
be
in
love
--
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
continued
rub-rub-rubbing
--
I
felt
it
spread
from
under
her
hand
,
*NL*
an
'
please
your
honour
,
to
every
part
of
my
frame
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
she
rubb
'd
,
and
the
longer
strokes
she
took
--
the
more
the
fire
*NL*
kindled
in
my
veins
--
till
at
length
,
by
two
or
three
strokes
longer
than
*NL*
the
rest
--
my
passion
rose
to
the
highest
pitch
--
I
seiz
'd
her
hand
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
then
thou
clapped
`
st
it
to
thy
lips
,
Trim
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
and
*NL*
madest
a
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
the
corporal
's
amour
terminated
precisely
in
the
way
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
described
it
,
is
not
material
;
it
is
enough
that
it
contained
in
*NL*
it
the
essence
of
all
the
love
romances
which
ever
have
been
wrote
since
*NL*
the
beginning
of
the

As
soon
as
the
corporal
had
finished
the
story
of
his
amour
--
or
rather
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
for
him
--
Mrs.
Wadman
silently
sallied
forth
from
her
*NL*
arbour
,
replaced
the
pin
in
her
mob
,
pass
'd
the
wicker
gate
,
and
*NL*
advanced
slowly
towards
my
uncle
Toby
's
sentry-box
:
the
disposition
*NL*
which
Trim
had
made
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
mind
,
was
too
favourable
a
crisis
*NL*
to
be
let
slipp
'd
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
attack
was
determin
'd
upon
:
it
was
facilitated
still
more
by
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
's
having
ordered
the
corporal
to
wheel
off
the
pioneer
's
*NL*
shovel
,
the
spade
,
the
pick-axe
,
the
picquets
,
and
other
military
stores
*NL*
which
lay
scatter
'd
upon
the
ground
where
Dunkirk
stood
--
The
corporal
*NL*
had
march
'd
--
the
field
was
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
consider
,
sir
,
what
nonsense
it
is
,
either
in
fighting
,
or
writing
,
*NL*
or
any
thing
else
-LRB-
whether
in
rhyme
to
it
,
or
not
-RRB-
which
a
man
has
*NL*
occasion
to
do
--
to
act
by
plan
:
for
if
ever
Plan
,
independent
of
all
*NL*
circumstances
,
deserved
registering
in
letters
of
gold
-LRB-
I
mean
in
the
*NL*
archives
of
Gotham
-RRB-
--
it
was
certainly
the
Plan
of
Mrs.
Wadman
's
attack
*NL*
of
my
uncle
Toby
in
his
sentry-box
,
By
Plan
--
Now
the
plan
hanging
up
in
*NL*
it
at
this
juncture
,
being
the
Plan
of
Dunkirk
--
and
the
tale
of
Dunkirk
*NL*
a
tale
of
relaxation
,
it
opposed
every
impression
she
could
make
:
and
*NL*
besides
,
could
she
have
gone
upon
it
--
the
manoeuvre
of
fingers
and
hands
*NL*
in
the
attack
of
the
sentry-box
,
was
so
outdone
by
that
of
the
fair
*NL*
Beguine
's
,
in
Trim
's
story
--
that
just
then
,
that
particular
attack
,
*NL*
however
successful
before
--
became
the
most
heartless
attack
that
could
*NL*
be
made
--
*NL*
*NL*
O
!
let
woman
alone
for
this
.
Mrs.
Wadman
had
scarce
open
'd
the
*NL*
wicker-gate
,
when
her
genius
sported
with
the
change
of
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*

She
formed
a
new
attack
in
a
moment

holding

handkerchief
to

as
she
approach
'd
the

I

has
got
into
this
eye
of

do
look
into

it
is
not

*NL*
*NL*
In
saying
which
,
Mrs.
Wadman
edged
herself
close
in
beside
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
,
and
squeezing
herself
down
upon
the
corner
of
his
bench
,
she
gave
*NL*
him
an
opportunity
of
doing
it
without
rising
up
--
Do
look
into
it
--
said
*NL*
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Honest
soul

thou
didst
look
into
it
with
as
much
innocency
of
heart
,
*NL*
as
ever
child
look
'd
into

raree-shew-box

and
`
twere
as
much
a
sin
to
*NL*
have
hurt
thee
.

*NL*
--
If
a
man
will
be
peeping
of
his
own
accord
into
things
of
that
*NL*
nature
--
I
've
nothing
to
say
to
it
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
never
did
:
and
I
will
answer
for
him
,
that
he
would
have
*NL*
sat
quietly
upon
a
sofa
from
June
to
January
-LRB-
which
,
you
know
,
takes
*NL*
in
both
the
hot
and
cold
months
-RRB-
,
with
an
eye
as
fine
as

Thracian

my

'T

And

I

pendulous

the
ashes
*NL*
falling
out

looking

looking

then
rubbing
his

*NL*
looking
again

with

In

Widow
Wadman

shines

There

furtively
shooting
out
from

in

all

into

If

An

is
for

exactly
like
a
cannon

in
this
respect

That
*NL*
it
is
not
so
much
the
eye
or
the
cannon
,
in
themselves

as
it
is
the

placed

I

that
whenever
I
speak
of
Mrs.

eyes
-LRB-
except
once
in

next
*NL*

-RRB-
,
that
you
keep
it
in

I
protest

Madam

said

I
can
see
nothing
whatever
in
your

main
into

Now
of
all
the
eyes
which
ever
were
created

from
your
own
,
Madam
,
up
to
*NL*
those
of
Venus
herself
,
which
certainly
were
as
venereal
a
pair
of
eyes
*NL*
as
ever
stood
in

head
--
there
never
was
an
eye
of
them
all

so
fitted
*NL*
to
rob
my
uncle
Toby
of
his
repose
,
as
the
very
eye
,
at
which
he
was
*NL*
looking
--
it
was
not
,
Madam
a
rolling
eye
--
a
romping
or
a
wanton
one
--
nor
*NL*
was
it
an
eye
sparkling
--
petulant
or
imperious
--
of
high
claims
and
*NL*
terrifying
exactions
,
which
would
have
curdled
at
once
that
milk
of
*NL*
human
nature
,
of
which
my
uncle
Toby
was
made
up
--
but
't
was
an
eye
*NL*
full
of
gentle
salutations
--
and
soft
responses
--
speaking
--
not
like
the
*NL*
trumpet
stop
of
some
ill-made
organ
,
in
which
many
an
eye
I
talk
to
,
*NL*
holds
coarse
converse
--
but
whispering
soft
--
like
the
last
low
accent
of
*NL*
an
expiring
saint
--
`
How
can
you
live
comfortless
,
captain
Shandy

alone

on

their

I

My

as
appears
from

was
very
subject
to
this

passion

before
he
married

from
a
little
subacid
kind
of
drollish
*NL*
impatience
in
his
nature
,
whenever
it
befell
him
,
he
would
never
submit
*NL*
to
it
like
a
christian
;
but
would
pish
,
and
huff
,
and
bounce
,
and
kick
,
*NL*
and
play
the
Devil
,
and
write
the
bitterest
Philippicks
against
the
eye
*NL*
that
ever
man
wrote
--
there
is
one
in
verse
upon
somebody
's
eye
or
other
,
*NL*
that
for
two
or
three
nights
together
,
had
put
him
by
his
rest
;
which
in
*NL*
his
first
transport
of
resentment
against
it
,
he
begins
thus
:
*NL*

'
A
Devil
't

and
mischief
such
doth
work

As
never

In
short
,
during
the
whole
paroxism
,
my
father
was
all
abuse
and
foul
*NL*
language
,
approaching
rather
towards
malediction
--
only
he
did
not
do
*NL*
it
with
as
much
method
as
Ernulphus
--
he
was
too
impetuous
;
nor
with
*NL*
Ernulphus
's
policy
--
for
tho
'
my
father
,
with
the
most
intolerant
spirit
,
*NL*
would
curse
both
this
and
that
,
and
every
thing
under
heaven
,
which
was
*NL*
either
aiding
or
abetting
to
his
love
--
yet
never
concluded
his
chapter
*NL*
of
curses
upon
it
,
without
cursing
himself
in
at
the
bargain
,
as
one
of
*NL*
the
most
egregious
fools
and
cox-combs
,
he
would
say
,
that
ever
was
let
*NL*
loose
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
,
on
the
contrary
,
took
it
like
a
lamb
--
sat
still
and
*NL*
let
the
poison
work
in
his
veins
without
resistance
--
in
the
sharpest
*NL*
exacerbations
of
his
wound
-LRB-
like
that
on
his
groin
-RRB-
he
never
dropt
one
*NL*
fretful
or
discontented
word
--
he
blamed
neither
heaven
nor
earth
--
or
*NL*
thought
or
spoke
an
injurious
thing
of
any
body
,
or
any
part
of
it
;
he
*NL*
sat
solitary
and
pensive
with
his
pipe
--
looking
at
his
lame
leg
--
then
*NL*
whiffing
out
a
sentimental
heigh
ho
!
which
mixing
with
the
smoke
,
*NL*
incommoded
no
one
mortal
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
it
like
a
lamb
--
I
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
truth
he
had
mistook
it
at
first
;
for
having
taken
a
ride
with
my
*NL*
father
,
that
very
morning
,
to
save
if
possible
a
beautiful
wood
,
which
*NL*
the
dean
and

were
hewing
down
to
give
to
the
poor
-LRB-
Mr.
Shandy
*NL*
must
mean
the
poor
in

;
inasmuch
as
they
divided
the
money
amongst

themselves
.
-RRB-
;
which
said
wood
being
in
full
view
of
my

house
,
and
of
singular
service
to
him
in
his
description
of
the
battle
*NL*
of
Wynnendale
--
by
trotting
on
too
hastily
to
save
it
--
upon
an
uneasy
*NL*
saddle
--
worse
horse
,
&
c.

c.
.

it
had
so
happened
,
that
the
serous
part
*NL*
of
the
blood
had
got
betwixt
the
two
skins
,
in
the
nethermost
part
of
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
--
the
first
shootings
of
which
-LRB-
as
my
uncle
Toby
had
no
*NL*
experience
of
love
-RRB-
he
had
taken
for
a
part
of
the
passion
--
till
the
*NL*
blister
breaking
in
the
one
case
--
and
the
other
remaining
--
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
was
presently
convinced
,
that
his
wound
was
not
a
skin-deep
wound
--
but
*NL*
that
it
had
gone
to
his
heart
.

therefore
when

he

no

your

was
very

musing

What
became
*NL*
of

Trim

*NL*
*NL*

We
lost
it
,
an

somehow
betwixt

but
your

honour
was
as
free
from

then
,
as
I
am

't
was
just
whilst
thou
*NL*
went

off
with
the
wheel-barrow

with
Mrs.
Wadman

quoth
my

She

left
a

added
my

pointing

She

stand

But
as
we

Trim

the
best

I

is
to

Mrs.

had
told

with
all
its

to
Mrs.

*NL*
twenty-four
hours
before

and
was
at
that
very
moment
sitting
in
council
*NL*
with
her
,
touching
some
slight
misgivings
with
regard
to
the
issue
of

,
which
the

I

said

in

that

be
so
very
large

replied
Bridget

as
you
think

I
believe
,
besides

added
she

that
't
is
dried
up

I
could
like
to

merely

We

know

of

in

answered
Mrs.

Bridget
,
for
whilst
the
captain
is
paying
his
addresses
to
you
--
I
'm
*NL*
confident
Mr.

will
be
for
making
love
to

I
'll
let
him
as

much
as

added
Bridget

to
get
it
all
out
of
him

*NL*

The
measures
were
taken

If
any
thing
in

,
which
my

said
,
could
have
provoked
my
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
during
the
time
he
was
in

,
it
was
the
perverse
use
my
*NL*
father
was
always
making
of
an
expression
of
Hilarion
the
hermit
;
who
,
*NL*
in
speaking
of
his
abstinence
,
his
watchings
,
flagellations
,
and
*NL*
other
instrumental
parts
of

would
say

tho
'
with
more

than
became

`
That
they
were
the
means
he
used

make

his

leave
off
kicking

*NL*
*NL*
It
pleased
my
father
well
;
it
was
not
only
a
laconick
way
of
*NL*
expressing
--
but
of
libelling
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
desires
and
*NL*
appetites
of
the
lower
part
of
us
;
so
that
for
many
years
of
my
father
's
*NL*
life
,
't
was
his
constant
mode
of
expression
--
he
never
used
the
word
*NL*
passions
once
--
but
ass
always
instead
of
them
--
So
that
he
might
be
said
*NL*
truly
,
to
have
been
upon
the
bones
,
or
the
back
of
his
own
ass

or
else
*NL*
of
some
other
man

during
all
that
time

*NL*
*NL*
I
must
here
observe
to
you
the
difference
betwixt
My
father
's
ass
and
my
*NL*
hobby-horse
--
in
order
to
keep
characters
as
separate
as
may
be

in

fancies

*NL*
*NL*
For
my
hobby-horse
,
if
you
recollect
a
little

is
no
way
a
vicious
*NL*
beast
;
he
has
scarce
one
hair
or
lineament
of
the
ass
about
him
--
'T
is
*NL*
the
sporting
little
filly-folly
which
carries
you
out
for
the

hour

a
maggot

a

,
a

a
fiddlestick
--
an
uncle
Toby

siege

or
an
any
thing

which
a

makes
a
shift
to
get
a-stride
on

to
*NL*
canter
it
away
from
the

and
solicitudes
of
life

'T
is
as
useful
*NL*
a

as
is
in

creation

nor
do
I
really
see
how
the

*NL*
could
do
without
it

But
for

Now
my

thinking
more
of
the
part
where
he
had
had
the

blister
,
than
of
Hilarion

metaphor
--
and
our
preconceptions
having

know

as
great
a
power
over
the
sounds
of
words
as
the
shapes
of

*NL*
he
had
imagined
,
that
my
father

who
was
not
very
ceremonious
in
his
*NL*
choice
of
words

had
enquired
after
the

so
*NL*
notwithstanding
my
mother
,
doctor
Slop
,
and
Mr.
Yorick

were
sitting

he
thought
it

conform

made
use

than
not

When

commit
one
of

I

let
him
chuse
which
he
will

*NL*
the

will
blame
him

*NL*
Asse
off

the
laugh
then
becoming
general
--
there
was
no
*NL*
bringing
him
back
to
the
charge
,
for
some
time
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
the
discourse
went
on
without
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
body
,
said
my
mother
,
says
you
are
in
love
,
brother
Toby
,
--
and
we
*NL*
hope
it
is
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
as
much
in
love
,
sister
,
I
believe
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
as
any
*NL*
man
usually
is
--
Humph
!
said
my
father
--
and
when
did
you
know
it
?
quoth
*NL*
my
mother

When
the

broke

replied
my

My

LVII

*NL*
*NL*
As
the
ancients
agree
,
brother
Toby
,
said
my
father
,
that
there
are
two
*NL*
different
and
distinct
kinds
of
love
,
according
to
the
different
parts
*NL*
which
are
affected
by
it
--
the
Brain
or
Liver
--
I
think
when
a
man
is
in
*NL*
love
,
it
behoves
him
a
little
to
consider
which
of
the
two
he
is
fallen
*NL*
into
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
signifies
it
,
brother
Shandy
,
replied
my
uncle
Toby
,
which
of
the
*NL*
two
it
is
,
provided
it
will
but
make
a
man
marry
,
and
love
his
wife
,
and
*NL*
get
a
few
children
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
few
children
!
cried
my
father
,
rising
out
of
his
chair
,
and
looking
*NL*
full
in
my
mother
's
face
,
as
he
forced
his
way
betwixt
her
's
and
doctor
*NL*
Slop
's
--
a
few
children
!
cried
my
father
,
repeating
my
uncle
Toby
's
words
*NL*
as
he
walk
'd
to
and
fro
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Not
,
my
dear
brother
Toby
,
cried
my
father
,
recovering
himself
all
at
*NL*
once
,
and
coming
close
up
to
the
back
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
chair
--
not
*NL*
that
I
should
be
sorry
hadst
thou
a
score
--
on
the
contrary
,
I
should
*NL*
rejoice
--
and
be
as
kind
,
Toby
,
to
every
one
of
them
as
a
father
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
stole
his
hand
unperceived
behind
his
chair
,
to
give
my
*NL*
father
's
a
squeeze
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Nay
,
moreover
,
continued
he
,
keeping
hold
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
hand
--
so
*NL*
much
dost
thou
possess
,
my
dear
Toby
,
of
the
milk
of
human
nature
,
and
*NL*
so
little
of
its
asperities
--
't
is
piteous
the
world
is
not
peopled
by
*NL*
creatures
which
resemble
thee
;
and
was
I
an
Asiatic
monarch
,
added
*NL*
my
father
,
heating
himself
with
his
new
project
--
I
would
oblige
thee
,
*NL*
provided
it
would
not
impair
thy
strength
--
or
dry
up
thy
radical
*NL*
moisture
too
fast
--
or
weaken
thy
memory
or
fancy
,
brother
Toby
,
which
*NL*
these
gymnics
inordinately
taken
are
apt
to
do
--
else
,
dear
Toby
,
I
would
*NL*
procure
thee
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
my
empire
,
and
I
would
oblige
*NL*
thee
,
nolens
,
volens
,
to
beget
for
me
one
subject
every
month
--
*NL*
*NL*
As
my
father
pronounced
the
last
word
of
the
sentence
--
my
mother
took
a
*NL*
pinch
of
snuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
would
not
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
get
a
child
,
nolens
,
volens
,
that
*NL*
is
,
whether
I
would
or
no
,
to
please
the
greatest
prince
upon
earth
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
`
twould
be
cruel
in
me
,
brother
Toby
,
to
compel
thee
;
said
my
*NL*
father
--
but
't
is
a
case
put
to
shew
thee
,
that
it
is
not
thy
begetting
*NL*
a
child
--
in
case
thou
should
`
st
be
able
--
but
the
system
of
Love
and
*NL*
Marriage
thou
goest
upon
,
which
I
would
set
thee
right
in
--
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
at
least
,
said
Yorick
,
a
great
deal
of
reason
and
plain
sense
*NL*
in
captain
Shandy
's
opinion
of
love
;
and
't
is
amongst
the
ill-spent
*NL*
hours
of
my
life
,
which
I
have
to
answer
for
,
that
I
have
read
so
many
*NL*
flourishing
poets
and
rhetoricians
in
my
time
,
from
whom
I
never
could
*NL*
extract
so
much
--
I
wish
,
Yorick
,
said
my
father
,
you
had
read
Plato
;
*NL*
for
there
you
would
have
learnt
that
there
are
two
Loves
--
I
know
there
*NL*
were
two
Religions
,
replied
Yorick
,
amongst
the
ancients
--
one
--
for
the
*NL*
vulgar
,
and
another
for
the
learned
;
--
but
I
think
One
Love
might
have
*NL*
served
both
of
them
very
well
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
;
replied
my
father
--
and
for
the
same
reasons
:
for
of
*NL*
these
Loves
,
according
to
Ficinus
's
comment
upon
Velasius
,
the
one
is
*NL*
rational
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
the
other
is
natural
--
the
first
ancient
--
without
mother
--
where
Venus
*NL*
had
nothing
to
do
:
the
second
,
begotten
of
Jupiter
and
Dione
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Pray
,
brother
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
what
has
a
man
who
believes
in
*NL*
God
to
do
with
this
?
My
father
could
not
stop
to
answer
,
for
fear
of
*NL*
breaking
the
thread
of
his
discourse
--
*NL*
*NL*
This
latter
,
continued
he
,
partakes
wholly
of
the
nature
of
Venus
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
,
which
is
the
golden
chain
let
down
from
heaven
,
excites
*NL*
to
love
heroic
,
which
comprehends
in
it
,
and
excites
to
the
desire
of
*NL*
philosophy
and
truth
--
the
second
,
excites
to
desire
,
simply
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
think
the
procreation
of
children
as
beneficial
to
the
world
,
said
*NL*
Yorick
,
as
the
finding
out
the
longitude
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
To
be
sure
,
said
my
mother
,
love
keeps
peace
in
the
world
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
In
the
house
--
my
dear
,
I
own
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
replenishes
the
earth
;
said
my
mother
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
keeps
heaven
empty
--
my
dear
;
replied
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
Virginity
,
cried
Slop
,
triumphantly
,
which
fills
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
push
'd
nun
!

my
father

Chapter

LVIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
had
such
a
skirmishing
,
cutting
kind
of
a
slashing
way
with
*NL*
him
in
his
disputations
,
thrusting
and
ripping
,
and
giving
every
one
a
*NL*
stroke
to
remember
him
by
in
his
turn
--
that
if
there
were
twenty
people
*NL*
in
company
--
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
was
sure
to
have
every
one
of
*NL*
'em
against
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
not
a
little
contribute
to
leave
him
thus
without
an
ally
,
was
,
*NL*
that
if
there
was
any
one
post
more
untenable
than
the
rest
,
he
would
be
*NL*
sure
to
throw
himself
into
it
;
and
to
do
him
justice
,
when
he
was
*NL*
once
there
,
he
would
defend
it
so
gallantly
,
that
`
twould
have
been
a
*NL*
concern
,
either
to
a
brave
man
or
a
good-natured
one
,
to
have
seen
him
*NL*
driven
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yorick
,
for
this
reason
,
though
he
would
often
attack
him
--
yet
could
*NL*
never
bear
to
do
it
with
all
his
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Slop
's
Virginity
,
in
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
,
had
got
him
*NL*
for
once
on
the
right
side
of
the
rampart
;
and
he
was
beginning
to
blow
*NL*
up
all
the
convents
in
Christendom
about
Slop
's
ears
,
when
corporal
Trim
*NL*
came
into
the
parlour
to
inform
my
uncle
Toby
,
that
his
thin
scarlet
*NL*
breeches
,
in
which
the
attack
was
to
be
made
upon
Mrs.
Wadman
,
would
not
*NL*
do
;
for
that
the
taylor
,
in
ripping
them
up
,
in
order
to
turn
them
,
had
*NL*
found
they
had
been
turn
'd
before
--
Then
turn
them
again
,
brother
,
said
*NL*
my
father
,
rapidly
,
for
there
will
be
many
a
turning
of
'em
yet
*NL*
before
all
's
done
in
the
affair
--
They
are
as
rotten
as
dirt
,
said
*NL*
the
corporal
--
Then
by
all
means
,
said
my
father
,
bespeak
a
new
pair
,
*NL*
brother
--
for
though
I
know
,
continued
my
father
,
turning
himself
to
the
*NL*
company
,
that
widow
Wadman
has
been
deeply
in
love
with
my
brother
Toby
*NL*
for
many
years
,
and
has
used
every
art
and
circumvention
of
woman
to
*NL*
outwit
him
into
the
same
passion
,
yet
now
that
she
has
caught
him
--
her
*NL*
fever
will
be
pass
'd
its
height
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
She
has
gained
her
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
case
,
continued
my
father
,
which
Plato
,
I
am
persuaded
,
never
*NL*
thought
of
--
Love
,
you
see
,
is
not
so
much
a
Sentiment
as
a
Situation
,
*NL*
into
which
a
man
enters
,
as
my
brother
Toby
would
do
,
into
a
corps
--
no
*NL*
matter
whether
he
loves
the
service
or
no
--
being
once
in
it
--
he
acts
as
*NL*
if
he
did
;
and
takes
every
step
to
shew
himself
a
man
of
prowesse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hypothesis
,
like
the
rest
of
my
father
's
,
was
plausible
enough
,
and
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
had
but
a
single
word
to
object
to
it
--
in
which
Trim
stood
*NL*
ready
to
second
him
--
but
my
father
had
not
drawn
his
conclusion
--
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
reason
,
continued
my
father
-LRB-
stating
the
case
over
*NL*
again
-RRB-
--
notwithstanding
all
the
world
knows
,
that
Mrs.
Wadman
affects
my
*NL*
brother
Toby
--
and
my
brother
Toby
contrariwise
affects
Mrs.
Wadman
,
and
*NL*
no
obstacle
in
nature
to
forbid
the
music
striking
up
this
very
night
,
*NL*
yet
will
I
answer
for
it
,
that
this
self-same
tune
will
not
be
play
'd
*NL*
this
twelvemonth
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
taken
our
measures
badly
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
up
*NL*
interrogatively
in
Trim
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
would
lay
my
Montero-cap
,
said
Trim
--
Now
Trim
's
Montero-cap
,
as
I
once
*NL*
told
you
,
was
his
constant
wager
;
and
having
furbish
'd
it
up
that
*NL*
very
night
,
in
order
to
go
upon
the
attack
--
it
made
the
odds
look
more
*NL*
considerable
--
I
would
lay
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
my
Montero-cap
to
a
*NL*
shilling
--
was
it
proper
,
continued
Trim
-LRB-
making
a
bow
-RRB-
,
to
offer
a
wager
*NL*
before
your
honours
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
There
is
nothing
improper
in
it
,
said
my
father
--
't
is
a
mode
of
*NL*
expression
;
for
in
saying
thou
would
`
st
lay
thy
Montero-cap
to
a
*NL*
shilling
--
all
thou
meanest
is
this
--
that
thou
believest
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
,
What
do
`
st
thou
believe
?
*NL*
*NL*
That
widow
Wadman
,
an
'
please
your
worship
,
can
not
hold
it
out
ten
*NL*
days
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
whence
,
cried
Slop
,
jeeringly
,
hast
thou
all
this
knowledge
of
*NL*
woman
,
friend
?
*NL*
*NL*
By
falling
in
love
with
a
popish
clergy-woman
;
said
Trim
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
was
a
Beguine
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Slop
was
too
much
in
wrath
to
listen
to
the
distinction
;
and
my
*NL*
father
taking
that
very
crisis
to
fall
in
helter-skelter
upon
the
whole
*NL*
order
of
Nuns
and
Beguines
,
a
set
of
silly
,
fusty
,
baggages
--
Slop
could
*NL*
not
stand
it
--
and
my
uncle
Toby
having
some
measures
to
take
about
his
*NL*
breeches
--
and
Yorick
about
his
fourth
general
division
--
in
order
for
*NL*
their
several
attacks
next
day
--
the
company
broke
up
:
and
my
father
*NL*
being
left
alone
,
and
having
half
an
hour
upon
his
hands
betwixt
that
*NL*
and
bed-time
;
he
called
for
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
and
wrote
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
the
following
letter
of
instructions
:
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
brother
Toby
,
*NL*
*NL*
What
I
am
going
to
say
to
thee
is
upon
the
nature
of
women
,
and
of
*NL*
love-making
to
them
;
and
perhaps
it
is
as
well
for
thee
--
tho
'
not
so
*NL*
well
for
me
--
that
thou
hast
occasion
for
a
letter
of
instructions
upon
*NL*
that
head
,
and
that
I
am
able
to
write
it
to
thee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
it
been
the
good
pleasure
of
him
who
disposes
of
our
lots
--
and
*NL*
thou
no
sufferer
by
the
knowledge
,
I
had
been
well
content
that
thou
*NL*
should
`
st
have
dipp
'd
the
pen
this
moment
into
the
ink
,
instead
of
*NL*
myself
;
but
that
not
being
the
case
--
Mrs.
Shandy
being
now
close
beside
*NL*
me
,
preparing
for
bed
--
I
have
thrown
together
without
order
,
and
just
as
*NL*
they
have
come
into
my
mind
,
such
hints
and
documents
as
I
deem
may
be
*NL*
of
use
to
thee
;
intending
,
in
this
,
to
give
thee
a
token
of
my
love
;
not
*NL*
doubting
,
my
dear
Toby
,
of
the
manner
in
which
it
will
be
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
with
regard
to
all
which
concerns
religion
in
the
*NL*
affair
--
though
I
perceive
from
a
glow
in
my
cheek
,
that
I
blush
as
*NL*
I
begin
to
speak
to
thee
upon
the
subject
,
as
well
knowing
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
thy
unaffected
secrecy
,
how
few
of
its
offices
thou
*NL*
neglectest
--
yet
I
would
remind
thee
of
one
-LRB-
during
the
continuance
of
*NL*
thy
courtship
-RRB-
in
a
particular
manner
,
which
I
would
not
have
omitted
;
*NL*
and
that
is
,
never
to
go
forth
upon
the
enterprize
,
whether
it
be
in
*NL*
the
morning
or
the
afternoon

without
first
recommending
thyself
to
the
*NL*
protection
of
Almighty
God

may
defend
thee
from

one

*NL*
*NL*
Shave
the

clean
once
at
least
every
four
or
five
*NL*
days
,
but
oftner
if
convenient
;
lest
in
taking
off
thy
wig
before
her
,
*NL*
thro

absence
of

,
she
should
be
able
to
discover
how
much
has
been

cut
away
by

how
much
by

Twere

carry

*NL*
*NL*
`
That
women
are
timid
:

And
't
is
well
they
are
--
else
there
would
be
no
*NL*
dealing
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
not
thy
breeches
be
too
tight
,
or
hang
too
loose
about
thy
thighs
,
*NL*
like
the
trunk-hose
of
our

.
*NL*
*NL*
--
A
just
medium
prevents
all
conclusions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
thou
hast
to
say
,
be
it
more
or
less
,
forget
not
to
utter
it
*NL*
in
a
low
soft
tone
of
voice
.
Silence
,
and
whatever
approaches
it
,
weaves
*NL*
dreams
of
midnight
secrecy
into
the
brain
:
For
this
cause
,
if
thou
canst
*NL*
help
it
,
never
throw
down
the
tongs
and
poker
.
*NL*
*NL*
Avoid
all
kinds
of
pleasantry
and
facetiousness
in
thy
discourse
with
*NL*
her
,
and
do
whatever
lies
in
thy
power
at
the
same
time
,
to
keep
*NL*
her
from
all
books
and
writings
which
tend
thereto
:
there
are
some
*NL*
devotional
tracts
,
which
if
thou
canst
entice
her
to
read
over
--
it
will
*NL*
be
well
:
but
suffer
her
not
to
look
into
Rabelais
,
or
Scarron
,
or
Don
*NL*
Quixote
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
are
all
books
which
excite
laughter
;
and
thou
knowest
,
dear
Toby

*NL*
that
there
is
no
passion
so
serious
as
lust

*NL*
*NL*
Stick
a
pin
in
the
bosom
of
thy
shirt
,
before
thou
enterest
her
parlour
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
thou
art
permitted
to
sit

she
*NL*
gives
thee
occasion

lay
thy

upon

beware
of
taking
it
--
thou
*NL*
canst
not
lay
thy
hand
on
hers
,
but
she
will
feel
the
temper
of
thine
.
*NL*
Leave
that
and
as
many
other
things
as
thou
canst
,
quite
undetermined
;
*NL*
by
so
doing
,
thou
wilt
have
her
curiosity
on
thy
side
;
and
if
she
is
not
*NL*
conquered
by
that
,
and
thy
Asse
continues
still
kicking
,
which
there
is
*NL*
great
reason
to
suppose
--
Thou
must
begin
,
with
first
losing
a
few
*NL*
ounces
of
blood
below
the
ears
,
according
to
the
practice
of
the
ancient
*NL*
Scythians
,
who
cured
the
most
intemperate
fits
of
the
appetite
by
that
*NL*
means

Avicenna

is
for
having

anointed

of

hellebore

using
proper
evacuations

purges
--
and
I
believe
rightly

But
thou
must
eat
little

no

flesh

nor
red
deer

thou

,
from

coots

water-hens
--
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
thy
drink

I
need
not
tell
thee
,
it
must
be
the
infusion
of
*NL*
Vervain
and
the
herb
Hanea
,
of
which
Aelian
relates
such
effects
--
but
*NL*
if
thy
stomach
palls
with
it
--
discontinue
it
from
time

,
taking
*NL*
cucumbers

water-lillies

in

the
stead

There
is
nothing

which
occurs

me
at

Whilst
my

was
writing
his
letter
of
instructions
,
my
uncle
Toby
*NL*
and
the
corporal
were
busy
in
preparing
every
thing
for
the
attack
.
As
*NL*
the
turning
of
the
thin
scarlet
breeches
was
laid
aside
-LRB-
at
least
for
*NL*
the
present
-RRB-
,
there
was
nothing
which
should
put
it
off
beyond
the
next
*NL*
morning
;
so
accordingly
it
was
resolv
'd
upon
,
for
eleven
o'clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Come
,
my
dear
,
said
my
father
to
my

--
`
twill
be
but
like
a
brother
*NL*
and
sister
,
if
you
and
I
take
a
walk
down
to
my
brother
Toby
's
--
to
*NL*
countenance
him
in
this
attack
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
had
been
accoutred
both
some
time
,
when
*NL*
my
father
and
mother
enter
'd
,
and
the
clock
striking
eleven
,
were
that
*NL*
moment
in
motion
to
sally
forth
--
but
the
account
of
this
is
worth
more
*NL*
than
to
be
wove
into
the
fag
end
of
the
eighth

such
a

this

My
father
had
no
time
but
to
*NL*
put
the
letter
of
instructions
into
my
uncle
Toby
's
coat-pocket
--
and
*NL*
join
with
my
mother
in
wishing
his
attack
prosperous
.

*NL*
I
could
like

said
my

to

all

check
us
in

stated

a
different
impulse

in

*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
but
the
fermentation
of
that
little
subacid
humour
,
which
I
*NL*
have
often
spoken
of
,
in
my
father
's
habit
,
could
have
vented
such
an
*NL*
insinuation
--
he
was
however
frank
and
generous
in
his
nature
,
and
at
all
*NL*
times
open
to
conviction
;
so
that
he
had
scarce
got
to
the
last
word
of
*NL*
this
ungracious
retort
,
when
his
conscience
smote
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mother
was
then
conjugally
swinging
with
her
left
arm
twisted
under
*NL*
his
right
,
in
such
wise
,
that
the
inside
of
her
hand
rested
upon
the
*NL*
back
of
his
--
she
raised
her
fingers
,
and
let
them
fall
--
it
could
scarce
*NL*
be
call
'd
a
tap
;
or
if
it
was
a
tap
--
`
twould
have
puzzled
a
casuist
to
*NL*
say
,
whether
't
was
a
tap
of
remonstrance
,
or
a
tap
of
confession
:
*NL*
my
father
,
who
was
all
sensibilities
from
head
to
foot
,
class
'd
it
*NL*
right
--
Conscience
redoubled
her
blow
--
he
turn
'd
his
face
suddenly
the
*NL*
other
way
,
and
my
mother
supposing
his
body
was
about
to
turn
with
it
in
*NL*
order
to
move
homewards
,
by
a
cross
movement
of
her
right
leg
,
keeping
*NL*
her
left
as
its
centre
,
brought
herself
so
far
in
front
,
that
as
he
*NL*
turned
his
head
,
he
met
her
eye
--
Confusion
again
!
he
saw
a
thousand
*NL*
reasons
to
wipe
out
the
reproach
,
and
as
many
to
reproach
himself
--
a
*NL*
thin
,
blue
,
chill
,
pellucid
chrystal
with
all
its
humours
so
at
rest
,
*NL*
the
least
mote
or
speck
of
desire
might
have
been
seen
,
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
it
,
had
it
existed
--
it
did
not
--
and
how
I
happen
to
be
so
lewd
myself
,
*NL*
particularly
a
little
before
the
vernal
and
autumnal
equinoxes
--
Heaven
*NL*
above
knows
--
My
mother
--
madam
--
was
so
at
no
time
,
either
by
nature
,
by
*NL*
institution
,
or
example
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
temperate
current
of
blood
ran
orderly
through
her
veins
in
all
months
*NL*
of
the
year
,
and
in
all
critical
moments
both
of
the
day
and
night
*NL*
alike
;
nor
did
she
superinduce
the
least
heat
into
her
humours
from
the
*NL*
manual
effervescencies
of
devotional
tracts
,
which
having
little
or
no
*NL*
meaning
in
them
,
nature
is
oft-times
obliged
to
find
one
--
And
as
for
*NL*
my
father
's
example
!
't
was
so
far
from
being
either
aiding
or
abetting
*NL*
thereunto
,
that
't
was
the
whole
business
of
his
life
,
to
keep
all
*NL*
fancies
of
that
kind
out
of
her
head
--
Nature
had
done
her
part
,
to
have
*NL*
spared
him
this
trouble
;
and
what
was
not
a
little
inconsistent
,
my
*NL*
father
knew
it
--
And
here
am
I
sitting
,
this
12th
day
of
August
1766
,
in
*NL*
a
purple
jerkin
and
yellow
pair
of
slippers
,
without
either
wig
or
cap
*NL*
on
,
a
most
tragicomical
completion
of
his
prediction
,
`
That
I
should
*NL*
neither
think
,
nor
act
like
any
other
man
's
child
,
upon
that
very
*NL*
account
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
mistake
in
my
father
,
was
in
attacking
my
mother
's
motive
,
instead
*NL*
of
the
act
itself
;
for
certainly
key-holes
were
made
for
other
purposes
;
*NL*
and
considering
the
act
,
as
an
act
which
interfered
with
a
true
*NL*
proposition
,
and
denied
a
key-hole
to
be
what
it
was
--
it
became
a
*NL*
violation
of
nature
;
and
was
so
far
,
you
see
,
criminal
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
for
this
reason
,
an
'
please
your
Reverences
,
That
key-holes
are
*NL*
the
occasions
of
more
sin
and
wickedness
,
than
all
other
holes
in
this
*NL*
world
put
together
.

Though
the
corporal
had
been
as
good
as
his
word
in
putting
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
's
great
ramallie-wig
into
pipes
,
yet
the
time
was
too
short
to
*NL*
produce
any
great
effects
from
it
:
it
had
lain
many
years
squeezed
up
in
*NL*
the
corner
of
his
old
campaign
trunk
;
and
as
bad
forms
are
not
so
*NL*
easy
to
be
got
the
better
of
,
and
the
use
of
candle-ends
not
so
well
*NL*
understood
,
it
was
not
so
pliable
a
business
as
one
would
have
wished
.
*NL*
The
corporal
with
cheary
eye
and
both
arms
extended
,
had
fallen
back
*NL*
perpendicular
from
it
a
score
times
,
to
inspire
it
,
if
possible
,
with
*NL*
a
better
air
--
had
Spleen
given
a
look
at
it
,
`
twould
have
cost
her
*NL*
ladyship
a
smile
--
it
curl
'd
every
where
but
where
the
corporal
would
*NL*
have
it
;
and
where
a
buckle
or
two
,
in
his
opinion
,
would
have
done
it
*NL*
honour
,
he
could
as
soon
have
raised
the
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
it
was
--
or
rather
such
would
it
have
seem
'd
upon
any
other
*NL*
brow
;
but
the
sweet
look
of
goodness
which
sat
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
*NL*
assimilated
every
thing
around
it
so
sovereignly
to
itself
,
and
Nature
*NL*
had
moreover
wrote
Gentleman
with
so
fair
a
hand
in
every
line
of
his
*NL*
countenance
,
that
even
his
tarnish
'd
gold-laced
hat
and
huge
cockade
of
*NL*
flimsy
taffeta
became
him
;
and
though
not
worth
a
button
in
themselves
,
*NL*
yet
the
moment
my
uncle
Toby
put
them
on
,
they
became
serious
objects
,
*NL*
and
altogether
seem
'd
to
have
been
picked
up
by
the
hand
of
Science
to
*NL*
set
him
off
to
advantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
in
this
world
could
have
co-operated
more
powerfully
towards
*NL*
this
,
than
my
uncle
Toby
's
blue
and
gold
--
had
not
Quantity
in
some
*NL*
measure
been
necessary
to
Grace
:
in
a
period
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
*NL*
since
they
had
been
made
,
by
a
total
inactivity
in
my
uncle
Toby
's
life
,
*NL*
for
he
seldom
went
further
than
the
bowling-green
--
his
blue
and
gold
had
*NL*
become
so
miserably
too
straight
for
him
,
that
it
was
with
the
utmost
*NL*
difficulty
the
corporal
was
able
to
get
him
into
them
;
the
taking
them
*NL*
up
at
the
sleeves
,
was
of
no
advantage
.
--
They
were
laced
however
*NL*
down
the
back
,
and
at
the
seams
of
the
sides
,
&
c.
in
the
mode
of
King
*NL*
William
's
reign
;
and
to
shorten
all
description
,
they
shone
so
bright
*NL*
against
the
sun
that
morning
,
and
had
so
metallick
and
doughty
an
*NL*
air
with
them
,
that
had
my
uncle
Toby
thought
of
attacking
in
armour
,
*NL*
nothing
could
have
so
well
imposed
upon
his
imagination
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
thin
scarlet
breeches
,
they
had
been
unripp
'd
by
the
taylor
*NL*
between
the
legs
,
and
left
at
sixes
and
sevens
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Yes
,
Madam
,
--
but
let
us
govern
our
fancies
.
It
is
enough
they
were
*NL*
held
impracticable
the
night
before
,
and
as
there
was
no
alternative
in
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
's
wardrobe
,
he
sallied
forth
in
the
red
plush
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
had
array
'd
himself
in
poor
Le
Fever
's
regimental
coat
;
and
*NL*
with
his
hair
tuck
'd
up
under
his
Montero-cap
,
which
he
had
furbish
'd
up
*NL*
for
the
occasion
,
march
'd
three
paces
distant
from
his
master
:
a
whiff
*NL*
of
military
pride
had
puff
'd

his

upon

in

leather
thong
clipp
'd
into
a

beyond

hung
the
*NL*
corporal
's
stick

my

Toby
carried
his
cane
like
a

It
looks
well
at

My
uncle
Toby
turn
'd
his
head
more
than
once
behind
him
,
to
see
how
he
*NL*
was
supported
by
the
corporal
;
and
the
corporal
as
oft
as
he
did
it
,
*NL*
gave
a
slight
flourish
with
his
stick
--
but
not
vapouringly
;
and
with
the
*NL*
sweetest
accent
of
most
respectful
encouragement
,
bid
his
honour
`
never
*NL*
fear
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Now
my
uncle
Toby
did
fear
;
and
grievously
too
;
he
knew
not
-LRB-
as
my
*NL*
father
had
reproach
'd
him
-RRB-
so
much
as
the
right
end
of
a
Woman
from
the
*NL*
wrong
,
and
therefore
was
never
altogether
at
his
ease
near
any
one
of
*NL*
them
--
unless
in
sorrow
or
distress
;
then
infinite
was
his
pity
;
nor
*NL*
would
the
most
courteous
knight
of
romance
have
gone
further
,
at
least
*NL*
upon
one
leg
,
to
have
wiped
away
a
tear
from
a
woman
's
eye
;
and
yet
*NL*
excepting
once
that
he
was
beguiled
into
it
by
Mrs.
Wadman
,
he
had
*NL*
never
looked
stedfastly
into
one
;
and
would
often
tell
my
father
in
the
*NL*
simplicity
of
his
heart
,
that
it
was
almost
-LRB-
if
not
about
-RRB-
as
bad
as
*NL*
taking
bawdy
.
--
*NL*

And

it
is

would
say

up

She

said
the

,
just
as
*NL*
the
Jew
's
widow
at
Lisbon
took
it
of
my

Tom
.
--

*NL*

And
how
was
that
?
quoth
my

Toby
,
facing
quite
about
to
the
*NL*
corporal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your

replied
the
corporal
,
knows
of
Tom
's
misfortunes
;
but
this
*NL*
affair
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
any
further
than
this
,
That
if
Tom
*NL*
had
not
married
the
widow
--
or
had
it
pleased
God
after
their
marriage
,
*NL*
that
they
had
but
put
pork
into
their
sausages
,
the
honest
soul
*NL*
had
never
been
taken
out
of
his
warm
bed
,
and
dragg
'd
to
the
*NL*
inquisition
--
'T
is
a
cursed
place

added
the
corporal
,
shaking
his
*NL*
head
,
--
when
once
a
poor
creature
is
in
,
he
is
in

an
'

your

honour

for

*NL*
*NL*
'T
is
very
true
;
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
looking
gravely
at
Mrs.
Wadman
's
*NL*
house
,
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
,
continued
the
corporal
,
can
be
so
sad
as
confinement
for

life

or
so
sweet
,
an

said
my

musing

Whilst
a

cried
the
corporal
,
giving
a
flourish
with
his

stick
thus

My

look

earnestly
towards

The
corporal
had
unwarily
conjured
up
the
Spirit
of
calculation
with
his
*NL*
wand
;
and
he
had
nothing
to
do
,
but
to
conjure
him
down
again
with
his
*NL*
story
,
and
in
this
form
of
Exorcism

most
un-ecclesiastically
did
the

do
it

As
Tom
's
place
,
an
'

your

,
was
easy
--
and
the
weather
*NL*
warm
--
it
put
him
upon
thinking
seriously
of
settling
himself
in
the
*NL*
world
;
and
as
it
fell
out
about
that
time
,
that
a
Jew
who
kept
a
sausage
*NL*
shop
in
the
same
street
,
had
the
ill
luck
to
die
of
a
strangury
,
and
*NL*
leave
his
widow
in
possession
of
a
rousing
trade
--
Tom
thought
-LRB-
as
every
*NL*
body
in
Lisbon
was
doing
the
best
he
could
devise
for
himself
-RRB-
there
*NL*
could
be
no
harm
in
offering
her
his
service
to
carry
it
on
:
so
without
*NL*
any
introduction
to
the
widow
,
except
that
of
buying
a
pound
of
sausages
*NL*
at
her
shop
--
Tom
set
out
--
counting
the
matter
thus
within
himself
,
as
*NL*
he
walk
'd
along
;
that
let
the
worst
come
of
it
that
could
,
he
should
at
*NL*
least
get
a
pound
of
sausages
for
their
worth
--
but
,
if
things
went
*NL*
well
,
he
should
be
set
up
;
inasmuch
as
he
should
get
not
only
a
pound
of
*NL*
sausages
--
but
a
wife
and
--
a
sausage
shop
,
an
'

your

,
into
*NL*
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
servant
in

family
,
from
high
to

,
wish
'd
Tom
success
;
and
I

can
fancy

an
'

I
see
him
this
moment
with
his
white
*NL*
dimity
waist-coat
and
breeches
,
and
hat
a
little
o
'
one
side
,
passing
*NL*
jollily
along
the
street
,
swinging
his
stick
,
with
a
smile
and
a
*NL*
chearful
word
for
every
body
he
met
:
--
But
alas
!
Tom
!
thou
smilest
no
*NL*
more
,
cried
the
corporal
,
looking
on
one
side
of
him
upon
the
ground
,
as
*NL*
if
he
apostrophised
him
in
his
dungeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
fellow
!
said
my
uncle

,
feelingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was

light-hearted
lad

an

Then

resembled
thee

said
my

rapidly

The

blush
'd
down
to
his
fingers
ends

a
tear
of
sentimental

bashfulness

another
of
gratitude
to
my
uncle
Toby

and
a
tear
of
sorrow
*NL*
for
his
brother

misfortunes

started
into
his
eye
,
and
ran
sweetly
*NL*
down
his
cheek
together
;
my

Toby

kindled
as

at

taking

of

coat
-LRB-
which
had
been

that
of

as
if
to
ease
his

leg
,
but
in
reality
to

gratify
a

feeling

he
stood
silent
for
a
minute
and
a
half
;
at
the
*NL*
end
of
which
he
took
his
hand
away
,
and
the
corporal
making
a
bow

went

When
Tom

got
to
the
shop

there
was
nobody
in

it
,
but
a

negro
girl
,
with
a
bunch
of
white
feathers
slightly
tied
*NL*
to
the
end
of
a

cane
,
flapping
away
flies

not
killing
them

'T

my

Toby
--
she
had
suffered
persecution

Trim

and
had
learnt
mercy

She
was
good
,
an
'

from
nature
,
as
well
as
from
*NL*
hardships
;
and
there
are
circumstances
in
the
story
of
that
poor
*NL*
friendless
slut
,
that
would
melt
a
heart
of
stone
,
said
Trim
;
and
some
*NL*
dismal
winter
's
evening
,
when
your
honour
is
in
the
humour
,
they
shall
*NL*
be
told
you
with
the
rest
of
Tom
's
story
,
for
it
makes
a
part
of

Then
do
not
forget

my

Toby

*NL*
A
negro
has
a
soul
?

said
the
corporal
*NL*
-LRB-
doubtingly
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
not
much
versed
,
corporal
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
things
of
that
*NL*
kind
;
but
I
suppose
,
God
would
not
leave
him
without
one
,
any
more
than
*NL*
thee
or
me
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
would
be
putting
one
sadly
over
the
head
of
another
,
quoth
the
*NL*
corporal
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
so
;
said
my
uncle
Toby
.
Why
then
,
an
'
please

is
a
*NL*
black
wench
to
be
used
worse
than
a
white
one
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
give
no
reason
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Only
,
cried
the
corporal
,
shaking
his
head
,
because
she
has
no
one
to
*NL*
stand
up
for
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
'T
is
that
very
thing
,
Trim
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
--
which
recommends
her
*NL*
to
protection
--
and
her
brethren
with
her
;
't
is
the
fortune
of
war
which
*NL*
has
put
the
whip
into
our
hands
now
--
where
it
may
be
hereafter
,
heaven
*NL*
knows
!
--
but
be
it
where
it
will
,
the
brave
,
Trim
!
will
not
use
it
*NL*
unkindly
.
*NL*
*NL*

God
forbid

said
the
corporal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amen
,
responded
my
uncle
Toby
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
.

*NL*
The
corporal
returned
to
his
story
,
and
went
on
--
but
with
an
*NL*
embarrassment
in
doing
it
,
which
here
and
there
a
reader
in
this
world
*NL*
will
not
be
able
to
comprehend
;
for
by
the
many
sudden
transitions
all
*NL*
along
,
from
one
kind
and
cordial
passion
to
another
,
in
getting
thus
far
*NL*
on
his
way
,
he
had
lost
the
sportable
key
of
his
voice
,
which
gave
sense
*NL*
and
spirit
to
his
tale
:
he
attempted
twice
to
resume
it
,
but
could
not
*NL*
please
himself
;
so
giving
a
stout
hem
!
to
rally
back
the
retreating
*NL*
spirits
,
and
aiding
nature
at
the
same
time
with
his
left
arm
a
kimbo
*NL*
on
one
side
,
and
with
his
right
a
little
extended
,
supporting
her
on
*NL*
the
other
--
the
corporal
got
as
near
the
note
as
he
could
;
and
in
that
*NL*
attitude
,
continued
his
story

As
Tom
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
had
no
business
at
that
time
with
the
*NL*
Moorish
girl
,
he
passed
on
into
the
room
beyond
,
to
talk
to
the
Jew
's
*NL*
widow
about
love
--
and
this
pound
of
sausages
;
and
being
,
as
I
have
told
*NL*
your
honour
,
an
open
cheary-hearted
lad
,
with
his
character
wrote
in
his
*NL*
looks
and
carriage
,
he
took
a
chair
,
and
without
much
apology
,
but
with
*NL*
great
civility
at
the
same
time
,
placed
it
close
to
her
at
the
table
,
*NL*
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
so
awkward
,
as
courting
a
woman
,
an
'
please
your
*NL*
honour
,
whilst
she
is
making
sausages
--
So
Tom
began
a
discourse
upon
*NL*
them
;
first
,
gravely
,
--
`
as
how
they
were
made
--
with
what
meats
,
herbs
,
*NL*
and
spices
.
'
--
Then
a
little
gayly
,
--
as
,
`
With
what
skins
--
and
if
they
*NL*
never
burst
--
Whether
the
largest
were
not
the
best
?
'
--
and
so
on
--
taking
*NL*
care
only
as
he
went
along
,
to
season
what
he
had
to
say
upon
sausages
,
*NL*
rather
under
than
over
;
--
that
he
might
have
room
to
act
in
--
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
owing
to
the
neglect
of
that
very
precaution
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
*NL*
laying
his
hand
upon
Trim
's
shoulder
,
that
Count
De
la
Motte
lost
the
*NL*
battle
of
Wynendale
:
he
pressed
too
speedily
into
the
wood
;
which
if
he
*NL*
had
not
done
,
Lisle
had
not
fallen
into
our
hands
,
nor
Ghent
and
Bruges
,
*NL*
which
both
followed
her
example
;
it
was
so
late
in
the
year
,
continued
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
so
terrible
a
season
came
on
,
that
if
things
had
*NL*
not
fallen
out
as
they
did
,
our
troops
must
have
perish
'd
in
the
open
*NL*
field
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
,
therefore
,
may
not
battles
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
as
well
as
*NL*
marriages
,
be
made
in
heaven
?
--
my
uncle
Toby
mused
--
*NL*
*NL*
Religion
inclined
him
to
say
one
thing
,
and
his
high
idea
of
military
*NL*
skill
tempted
him
to
say
another
;
so
not
being
able
to
frame
a
reply
*NL*
exactly
to
his
mind
--
my
uncle
Toby
said
nothing
at
all
;
and
the
corporal
*NL*
finished
his
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Tom
perceived
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
that
he
gained
ground
,
and
*NL*
that
all
he
had
said
upon
the
subject
of
sausages
was
kindly
taken
,
he
*NL*
went
on
to
help
her
a
little
in
making
them
.
--
First
,
by
taking
hold
of
*NL*
the
ring
of
the
sausage
whilst
she
stroked
the
forced
meat
down
with
her
*NL*
hand
--
then
by
cutting
the
strings
into
proper
lengths
,
and
holding
them
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
whilst
she
took
them
out
one
by
one
--
then
,
by
putting
them
*NL*
across
her
mouth
,
that
she
might
take
them
out
as
she
wanted
them
--
and
*NL*
so
on
from
little
to
more
,
till
at
last
he
adventured
to
tie
the
sausage
*NL*
himself
,
whilst
she
held
the
snout
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
a
widow
,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
always
chuses
a
second
husband
as
*NL*
unlike
the
first
as
she
can
:
so
the
affair
was
more
than
half
settled
in
*NL*
her
mind

She
made
a

snatching
up

laid

Trim

-LRB-

upon
his
story

from

the

to
the

,
an
'
please
your
honour
,
love
jokes
;
the
*NL*
difficulty
is
to
know
how
they
chuse
to
have
them
cut
;
and
there
is
no
*NL*
knowing
that
,
but
by
trying
,
as
we
do
with
our
artillery
in
the
field
,
*NL*
by
raising
or
letting
down
their
breeches
,
till
we
hit
the
mark
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
like
the
comparison
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
better
than
the
thing
*NL*
itself
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Because
your
honour
,
quoth
the
corporal
,
loves
glory
,
more
than
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
hope
,
Trim
,
answered
my
uncle
Toby
,
I
love
mankind
more
than
either
;
*NL*
and
as
the
knowledge
of
arms
tends
so
apparently
to
the
good
and
quiet
*NL*
of
the
world
--
and
particularly
that
branch
of
it
which
we
have
practised
*NL*
together
in
our
bowling-green
,
has
no
object
but
to
shorten
the
strides
*NL*
of
Ambition
,
and
intrench
the
lives
and
fortunes
of
the
few
,
from
the
*NL*
plunderings
of
the
many
--
whenever
that
drum
beats
in
our
ears
,
I
*NL*
trust
,
corporal
,
we
shall
neither
of
us
want
so
much
humanity
and
*NL*
fellow-feeling
,
as
to
face
about
and
march
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
pronouncing
this
,
my
uncle
Toby
faced
about
,
and
march
'd
firmly
as
*NL*
at
the
head
of
his
company
--
and
the
faithful
corporal
,
shouldering
his
*NL*
stick
,
and
striking
his
hand
upon
his
coat-skirt
as
he
took
his
first
*NL*
step
--
march
'd
close
behind
him
down
the
avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
what
can
their
two
noddles
be
about
?
cried
my
father
to
my
*NL*
mother
--
by
all
that
's
strange
,
they
are
besieging
Mrs.
Wadman
in
*NL*
form
,
and
are
marching
round
her
house
to
mark
out
the
lines
of
*NL*
circumvallation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dare
say
,
quoth
my
mother
--
But
stop
,
dear
Sir
--
for
what
my
mother
*NL*
dared
to
say
upon
the
occasion
--
and
what
my
father
did
say
upon
it
--
with
*NL*
her
replies
and
his
rejoinders
,
shall
be
read
,
perused
,
paraphrased
,
*NL*
commented
,
and
descanted
upon
--
or
to
say
it
all
in
a
word
,
shall
be
*NL*
thumb
'd
over
by
Posterity
in
a
chapter
apart
--
I
say
,
by
Posterity
--
and
*NL*
care
not
,
if
I
repeat
the
word
again
--
for
what
has
this
book
done
more
*NL*
than
the
Legation
of
Moses
,
or
the
Tale
of
a
Tub
,
that
it
may
not
swim
*NL*
down
the
gutter
of
Time
along
with
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
not
argue
the
matter
:
Time
wastes
too
fast
:
every
letter
I
trace
*NL*
tells
me
with
what
rapidity
Life
follows
my
pen
:
the
days
and
hours
of
*NL*
it
,
more
precious
,
my
dear
Jenny
!
than
the
rubies
about
thy
neck
,
are
*NL*
flying
over
our
heads
like
light
clouds
of
a
windy
day
,
never
to
return
*NL*
more
--
every
thing
presses
on
--
whilst
thou
art
twisting
that
lock
,
--
see
!
*NL*
it
grows
grey
;
and
every
time
I
kiss
thy
hand
to
bid
adieu
,
and
every
*NL*
absence
which
follows
it
,
are
preludes
to
that
eternal
separation
which
*NL*
we
are
shortly
to
make

My
mother
had
gone
with
her
left
arm
twisted
in
my
father
's
right
,
till
*NL*
they
had
got
to
the
fatal
angle
of
the
old
garden
wall
,
where
Doctor
*NL*
Slop
was
overthrown
by
Obadiah
on
the
coach-horse
:
as
this
was
directly
*NL*
opposite
to
the
front
of
Mrs.
Wadman
's
house
,
when
my
father
came
to
it
,
*NL*
he
gave
a
look
across
;
and
seeing
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
within
*NL*
ten
paces
of
the
door
,
he
turn
'd
about
--
`
Let
us
just
stop
a
moment
,
*NL*
quoth
my
father
,
and
see
with
what
ceremonies
my
brother
Toby
and
his
*NL*
man
Trim
make
their
first
entry
--
it
will
not
detain
us
,
added
my
father
,
*NL*
a
single
minute
:

*NL*
*NL*
--
No
matter
,
if
it
be
ten
minutes

quoth
my
mother

*NL*
*NL*
--
It
will
not
detain
us
half
one
;
said
my
father
.
*NL*

The
corporal
was
just
then
setting
in
with
the
story
of
his
brother
*NL*
Tom
and
the
Jew
's
widow
:
the
story
went
on
--
and
on
--
it
had
episodes
in
*NL*
it
--
it
came
back
,
and
went
on
--
and
on
again
;
there
was
no
end
of
it
--
the
*NL*
reader
found
it
very
long
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
G.
.
help
my
father
!
he
pish
'd
fifty
times
at
every
new
attitude
,
and
*NL*
gave
the
corporal
's
stick
,
with
all
its
flourishings
and
danglings
,
to
*NL*
as
many
devils
as
chose
to
accept
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
issues
of
events
like
these
my
father
is
waiting
for
,
are
hanging
*NL*
in
the
scales
of
fate
,
the
mind
has
the
advantage
of
changing
the
*NL*
principle
of
expectation
three
times
,
without
which
it
would
not
have
*NL*
power
to
see
it
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curiosity
governs
the
first
moment
;
and
the
second
moment
is
all
*NL*
oeconomy
to
justify
the
expence
of
the
first
--
and
for
the
third
,
fourth
,
*NL*
fifth
,
and
sixth
moments
,
and
so
on
to
the
day
of
judgment
--
't
is
a
point
*NL*
of
Honour
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
need
not
be
told
,
that
the
ethic
writers
have
assigned
this
all
to
*NL*
Patience
;
but
that
Virtue
,
methinks
,
has
extent
of
dominion
sufficient
*NL*
of
her
own
,
and
enough
to
do
in
it
,
without
invading
the
few
dismantled
*NL*
castles
which
Honour
has
left
him
upon
the
earth

My
father
stood
it
out
as
well
as
he
could
with
these
three
auxiliaries
*NL*
to
the
end
of
Trim
's
story
;
and
from
thence
to
the
end
of
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
's
panegyrick
upon
arms
,
in
the
chapter
following
it
;
when
seeing
,
*NL*
that
instead
of
marching
up
to
Mrs.
Wadman
's
door
,
they
both
faced
*NL*
about
and
march
'd
down
the
avenue
diametrically
opposite
to
his
*NL*
expectation
--
he
broke
out
at
once
with
that
little
subacid
soreness
of
*NL*
humour
,
which
,
in
certain
situations
,
distinguished
his
character
from
*NL*
that
of
all
other
men

I

said

they
are
making
fortifications

Not
on

cried
my

stepping
back
--
*NL*
*NL*
I
suppose
not
:
quoth
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
wish
,
said
my

,
raising
his
voice
,
the
whole
science
of
*NL*
fortification
at
the
devil
,
with
all
its
trumpery
of
saps
,
mines
,
*NL*
blinds
,
gabions
,
fausse-brays
and
cuvetts
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
are
foolish
things
--
said
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
had
a
way
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
I
would
this
moment
give
away
my
*NL*
purple
jerkin
,
and
my
yellow
slippers
into
the
bargain
,
if
some
of
your
*NL*
reverences
would
imitate
--
and
that
was
,
never
to
refuse
her
assent
and
*NL*
consent
to
any
proposition
my
father
laid
before
her
,
merely
because
she
*NL*
did
not
understand
it
,
or
had
no
ideas
of
the
principal
word
or
term
of
*NL*
art
,
upon
which
the
tenet
or
proposition
rolled
.
She
contented
herself
*NL*
with
doing
all
that
her
godfathers
and
godmothers
promised
for
her
--
but
*NL*
no
more
;
and
so
would
go
on
using
a
hard
word
twenty
years
together
--
and
*NL*
replying
to
it
too
,
if
it
was
a
verb
,
in
all
its
moods
and
tenses
,
*NL*
without
giving
herself
any
trouble
to
enquire
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
eternal
source
of
misery
to
my
father
,
and
broke
the
neck
,
*NL*
at
the
first
setting
out
,
of
more
good
dialogues
between
them
,
than
*NL*
could
have
done
the
most
petulant
contradiction
--
the
few
which
survived
*NL*
were
the
better
for
the
cuvetts
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
`
They
are
foolish
things
;
'
said
my
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Particularly
the
cuvetts
;
replied
my
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
'T
is

he
tasted
the
sweet
of
triumph

went
on

Not
that

properly
speaking

Mrs.
Wadman

said
my
*NL*
father
,
partly
correcting
himself
--
because
she
is
but
tenant
for
life

*NL*
*NL*

That
makes
a
great
difference

said
my

In

replied
my

*NL*
Unless
she

said
my

But
she

persuade
my

Mr.
Shandy

quoth
my

*NL*
*NL*

Though

persuasion

said
my

again

with
such
a
sighing
cadence
of
personal
*NL*
pity
at
the
end
of
it
,
as
discomfited
every
fibre
about
my
father

he
*NL*
instantly
took
out
his
almanack

but
before
he
could
untie
it
,
Yorick

*NL*
congregation
coming
out

church

became
a
full
answer
to
one
half
*NL*
of
his
business
with

my

telling
him
it
was

left
him

Upon
looking
back
from
the
end
of
the
last
chapter
,
and
surveying
the
*NL*
texture
of
what
has
been
wrote
,
it
is
necessary
,
that
upon
this
page
and
*NL*
the
three
following
,
a
good
quantity
of
heterogeneous
matter
be
inserted
*NL*
to
keep
up
that
just
balance
betwixt
wisdom
and
folly
,
without
which
a
*NL*
book
would
not
hold
together
a
single
year
:
nor
is
it
a
poor
creeping
*NL*
digression
-LRB-
which
but
for
the
name
of
,
a
man
might
continue
as
well
*NL*
going
on
in
the
king
's
highway
-RRB-
which
will
do
the
business
--
no
;
if
it
*NL*
is
to
be
a
digression
,
it
must
be
a
good
frisky
one
,
and
upon
a
frisky
*NL*
subject
too
,
where
neither
the
horse
or
his
rider
are
to
be
caught
,
but
*NL*
by
rebound
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
difficulty
,
is
raising
powers
suitable
to
the
nature
of
*NL*
the
service
:
Fancy
is
capricious
--
Wit
must
not
be
searched
for
--
and
*NL*
Pleasantry
-LRB-
good-natured
slut
as
she
is
-RRB-
will
not
come
in
at
a
call
,
was
*NL*
an
empire
to
be
laid
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
best
way
for
a
man
,
is
to
say
his
prayers
--
*NL*
*NL*
Only
if
it
puts
him
in
mind
of
his
infirmities
and
defects
as
well
*NL*
ghostly
as
bodily
--
for
that
purpose
,
he
will
find
himself
rather
worse
*NL*
after
he
has
said
them
than
before
--
for
other
purposes
,
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
there
is
not
a
way
either
moral
or
mechanical
under
*NL*
heaven
that
I
could
think
of
,
which
I
have
not
taken
with
myself
in
this
*NL*
case
:
sometimes
by
addressing
myself
directly
to
the
soul
herself
,
and
*NL*
arguing
the
point
over
and
over
again
with
her
upon
the
extent
of
her
*NL*
own
faculties
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
never
could
make
them
an
inch
the
wider
--
*NL*
*NL*
Then
by
changing
my
system
,
and
trying
what
could
be
made
of
it
upon
the
*NL*
body
,
by
temperance
,
soberness
,
and
chastity
:
These
are
good
,
quoth
*NL*
I
,
in
themselves
--
they
are
good
,
absolutely
;
--
they
are
good
,
*NL*
relatively
;
--
they
are
good
for
health
--
they
are
good
for
happiness
in
*NL*
this
world
--
they
are
good
for
happiness
in
the
next
--
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
they
were
good
for
every
thing
but
the
thing
wanted
;
and
there
*NL*
they
were
good
for
nothing
,
but
to
leave
the
soul
just
as
heaven
made
*NL*
it
:
as
for
the
theological
virtues
of
faith
and
hope
,
they
give
it
*NL*
courage
;
but
then
that
snivelling
virtue
of
Meekness
-LRB-
as
my
father
would
*NL*
always
call
it
-RRB-
takes
it
quite
away
again
,
so
you
are
exactly
where
you
*NL*
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
in
all
common
and
ordinary
cases
,
there
is
nothing
which
I
have
*NL*
found
to
answer
so
well
as
this
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Certainly
,
if
there
is
any
dependence
upon

that

something

about
me
,
*NL*
merely
upon
this
symptom
of
it

that
I
do
not
know
what
envy
is
:

for
never
do
I
hit
upon
any
invention
or
device
which
tendeth
to
the
*NL*
furtherance
of
good
writing
,
but
I
instantly
make
it
public
;
willing
*NL*
that
all
mankind
should
write
as
well
as
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*

Which
they
certainly
will

they
think

Now
in
ordinary
cases
,
that
is
,
when
I
am
only
stupid
,
and
the
thoughts
*NL*
rise
heavily
and
pass
gummous
through
my
pen
--
*NL*
*NL*
Or
that
I
am
got
,
I
know
not
how
,
into
a
cold
unmetaphorical
vein
of
*NL*
infamous
writing
,
and
can
not
take
a
plumb-lift
out
of
it
for
my
soul
;
so
*NL*
must
be
obliged
to
go
on
writing
like
a
Dutch
commentator
to
the
end
of
*NL*
the
chapter
,
unless
something
be
done
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
never
stand
conferring
with
pen
and
ink
one
moment
;
for
if
a
pinch
*NL*
of
snuff
,
or
a
stride
or
two
across
the
room
will
not
do
the
business
*NL*
for
me
--
I
take
a
razor
at
once
;
and
having
tried
the
edge
of
it
upon
*NL*
the
palm
of
my
hand
,
without
further
ceremony
,
except
that
of
first
*NL*
lathering
my
beard
,
I
shave
it
off
;
taking
care
only
if
I
do
leave
a
*NL*
hair
,
that
it
be
not
a
grey
one
:
this
done
,
I
change
my
shirt
--
put
on
a
*NL*
better
coat
--
send
for
my
last
wig
--
put
my
topaz
ring
upon
my
finger
;
and
*NL*
in
a
word
,
dress
myself
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
me
,
after
my
best
*NL*
fashion

Now
the

in

this
does
not
do

consider

*NL*
Sir
,
as
every
man
chuses
to
be
present
at
the
shaving
of
his
own
beard
*NL*
-LRB-
though
there
is
no
rule
without
an
exception
-RRB-
,
and
unavoidably
sits
*NL*
over-against
himself
the
whole
time
it
is
doing
,
in
case
he
has
a
hand
*NL*
in
it
--
the
Situation
,
like
all
others
,
has
notions
of
her
own
to
put
*NL*
into
the
brain
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
maintain
it
,
the
conceits
of
a
rough-bearded
man
,
are
seven
years
*NL*
more
terse
and
juvenile
for
one
single
operation
;
and
if
they
did
not
*NL*
run
a
risk
of
being
quite
shaved
away
,
might
be
carried
up
by
continual
*NL*
shavings
,
to
the
highest
pitch
of
sublimity
--
How
Homer
could
write
with
*NL*
so
long
a
beard
,
I
do
n't
know
--
and
as
it
makes
against
my
hypothesis
,
I
*NL*
as
little
care
--
But
let
us
return
to
the
Toilet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ludovicus
Sorbonensis
makes
this
entirely
an
affair
of
the
body
-LRB-
Greek
-RRB-
*NL*
as
he
calls
it
--
but
he
is
deceived
:
the
soul
and
body
are
joint-sharers
*NL*
in
every
thing
they
get
:
A
man
can
not
dress
,
but
his
ideas
get
cloth
'd
*NL*
at
the
same
time
;
and
if
he
dresses
like
a
gentleman
,
every
one
of
them
*NL*
stands
presented
to
his
imagination
,
genteelized
along
with
him
--
so
that
*NL*
he
has
nothing
to
do
,
but
take
his
pen
,
and
write
like
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
cause
,
when
your
honours
and
reverences
would
know
whether
I
*NL*
writ
clean
and
fit
to
be
read
,
you
will
be
able
to
judge
full
as
well
by
*NL*
looking
into
my
Laundress
's
bill
,
as
my
book
:
there
is
one
single
month
*NL*
in
which
I
can
make
it
appear
,
that
I
dirtied
one
and
thirty
shirts
with
*NL*
clean
writing
;
and
after
all
,
was
more
abus
'd
,
cursed
,
criticis
'd
,
and
*NL*
confounded
,
and
had
more
mystic
heads
shaken
at
me
,
for
what
I
had
*NL*
wrote
in
that
one
month
,
than
in
all
the
other
months
of
that
year
put
*NL*
together
.

their
honours

had
not
seen

*NL*
As
I
never
had
any
intention
of
beginning
the
Digression
,
I
am
making
*NL*
all
this
preparation
for
,
till
I
come
to
the
74th
chapter
--
I
have
this
*NL*
chapter
to
put
to
whatever
use
I
think
proper
--
I
have
twenty
this
moment
*NL*
ready
for
it
--
I
could
write
my
chapter
of
Button-holes
in
it
--
*NL*
*NL*
Or
my
chapter
of
Pishes
,
which
should
follow
them
--
*NL*
*NL*
Or
my
chapter
of
Knots
,
in
case
their
reverences
have
done
with
*NL*
them
--
they
might
lead
me
into
mischief
:
the
safest
way
is
to
follow
*NL*
the
track
of
the
learned
,
and
raise
objections
against
what
I
have
been
*NL*
writing
,
tho
'
I
declare
before-hand
,
I
know
no
more
than
my
heels
how
to
*NL*
answer
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
first
,
it
may
be
said
,
there
is
a
pelting
kind
of
thersitical
*NL*
satire
,
as
black
as
the
very
ink
't
is
wrote
with
--
-LRB-
and
by
the
bye
,
*NL*
whoever
says
so
,
is
indebted
to
the
muster-master
general
of
the
Grecian
*NL*
army
,
for
suffering
the
name
of
so
ugly
and
foul-mouth
'd
a
man
as
*NL*
Thersites
to
continue
upon
his
roll
--
for
it
has
furnish
'd
him
with
an
*NL*
epithet
-RRB-
--
in
these
productions
he
will
urge
,
all
the
personal
washings
*NL*
and
scrubbings
upon
earth
do
a
sinking
genius
no
sort
of
good
--
but
*NL*
just
the
contrary
,
inasmuch
as
the
dirtier
the
fellow
is
,
the
better
*NL*
generally
he
succeeds
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
,
I
have
no
other
answer
--
at
least
ready
--
but
that
the
Archbishop
*NL*
of
Benevento
wrote
his
nasty
Romance
of
the
Galatea
,
as
all
the
world
*NL*
knows
,
in
a
purple
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
purple
pair
of
breeches
;
and
*NL*
that
the
penance
set
him
of
writing
a
commentary
upon
the
book
of
the
*NL*
Revelations
,
as
severe
as
it
was
look
'd
upon
by
one
part
of
the
world
,
*NL*
was
far
from
being
deem
'd
so
,
by
the
other
,
upon
the
single
account
of
*NL*
that
Investment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
objection
,
to
all
this
remedy
,
is
its
want
of
universality
;
*NL*
forasmuch
as
the
shaving
part
of
it
,
upon
which
so
much
stress
is
*NL*
laid
,
by
an
unalterable
law
of
nature
excludes
one
half
of
the
species
*NL*
entirely
from
its
use
:
all
I
can
say
is
,
that
female
writers
,
whether
of
*NL*
England
,
or
of
France
,
must
e
`
en
go
without
it
--

for

am

When
my
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
had
marched
down
to
the
bottom
of
*NL*
the
avenue
,
they
recollected
their
business
lay
the
other
way
;
so
they
*NL*
faced
about
and
marched
up
straight
to
Mrs.
Wadman
's
door
.

*NL*
I
warrant
your
honour

said
the
corporal
,
touching
his
Montero-cap
with
*NL*
his
hand
,
as
he
passed
him
in
order
to
give
a
knock
at
the
door
--
My
*NL*
uncle
Toby
,
contrary
to
his
invariable
way
of
treating
his
faithful
*NL*
servant
,
said
nothing
good
or
bad
:
the
truth
was
,
he
had
not
altogether
*NL*
marshal
'd
his
ideas
;
he
wish
'd
for
another
conference
,
and
as
the
*NL*
corporal
was
mounting
up
the
three
steps
before
the
door
--
he
hem
'd
*NL*
twice
--
a
portion
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
most
modest
spirits
fled
,
at
each
*NL*
expulsion
,
towards
the
corporal
;
he
stood
with
the
rapper
of
the
door
*NL*
suspended
for
a
full
minute
in
his
hand
,
he
scarce
knew
why
.
Bridget
*NL*
stood
perdue
within
,
with
her
finger
and
her
thumb
upon
the
latch
,
*NL*
benumb
'd
with
expectation
;
and
Mrs.
Wadman
,
with
an
eye
ready
to
be
*NL*
deflowered
again
,
sat
breathless
behind
the
window-curtain
of
her
*NL*
bed-chamber
,
watching
their
approach
.

said
my

Toby

but
as
he
articulated
the
word
,
the
minute
*NL*
expired

Trim
let
fall
the
rapper
.

My
uncle
Toby
perceiving
that
all
hopes
of
a
conference
were
knock

on

it

whistled

As
Mrs.

were
upon

the
corporal
did
*NL*
not
knock
as
often
as
perchance
your
honour

taylor
--
I
might
have
taken
*NL*
my
example
something
nearer
home

for
I
owe
mine

some
five
and
twenty
*NL*
pounds
at
least
,
and
wonder
at
the
man
's
patience
--
*NL*

But
this
is
nothing
at
all
to
the
world
:
only
't
is
a
cursed
thing
to
*NL*
be
in
debt
;
and
there
seems
to
be
a
fatality
in
the
exchequers
of
some
*NL*
poor
princes
,
particularly
those
of
our
house
,
which
no
Economy
can
*NL*
bind
down
in

for
my

I
'm

there

not
any
one
*NL*
prince

prelate

pope

or
potentate

great

small
upon

more

desirous

heart
of
keeping
straight
with
the
world
than
I
am
--
or
*NL*
who
takes
more
likely
means
for
it

I
never
give
above
half
a
guinea

or
*NL*
walk
with
boots
--
or
cheapen
tooth-picks

or
lay
out
a

upon
a
*NL*
band-box
the
year
round
;
and
for
the
six
months
I
'm
in
the
country
,
I
'm
*NL*
upon
so
small
a
scale
,
that
with
all
the
good
temper
in
the
world
,
I
*NL*
outdo
Rousseau
,
a
bar
length
--
for
I
keep
neither
man
or
boy

or
horse

*NL*
or
cow

or
any

except
a

thin
poor
piece
of

to
keep
my
fire
in

myself

but
if
you
think
this
makes
a

Whilst
all
this
was
running
through

my

Toby
had
risen
from
the
sopha
,
and
got
to
the
other
side
of
the
parlour

door
,
to
give
Trim
an
order
about
it
in
the
passage
--
*NL*
*NL*
...
--
I
believe
it
is
in

said
my

I

answered
Trim

Then
prithee
,
*NL*
step
directly
for
it

Trim

said
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
bring
it
into
the
*NL*
parlour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
did
not
approve
of
the
orders
,
but
most
cheerfully
obeyed
*NL*
them
.
The
first
was
not
an
act
of
his
will
--
the
second
was
;
so
he
put
*NL*
on
his
Montero-cap
,
and
went
as
fast
as
his
lame
knee
would
let
him
.
My
*NL*
uncle
Toby
returned
into
the
parlour

and
sat
himself
down
again
upon

the
sopha

As
there
are
fifty
different
ends
-LRB-
counting
all
ends
in
--
as
well
civil
*NL*
as
religious
-RRB-
for
which
a
woman
takes
a
husband
,
the
first
sets
about
*NL*

carefully
weighs
,
then
separates
and
distinguishes
in
her
mind
,
*NL*
which
of
all
that
number
of
ends
is
hers
;
then
by
discourse
,
enquiry
,
*NL*
argumentation
,
and
inference
,
she
investigates
and
finds
out
whether
*NL*
she
has
got
hold
of
the
right
one
--
and
if
she
has
--
then
,
by
pulling
it
*NL*
gently
this
way
and
that
way
,
she
further
forms
a
judgment

whether
it
*NL*

The
imagery
under
which
Slawkenbergius
impresses
this
upon
the
reader
's
*NL*
fancy
,
in
the
beginning
of
his
third
Decad
,
is
so
ludicrous
,
that
the
*NL*
honour
I
bear

will
not
suffer
me
to
quote
it

otherwise
it
is

not

`
She
first
,
saith
Slawkenbergius
,
stops
the
asse
,
and
holding
his
halter
*NL*
in
her
left
hand
-LRB-
lest
he
should
get
away
-RRB-
she
thrusts
her
right
hand
*NL*
into
the
very
bottom
of
his
pannier
to
search
for
it
--
For
what
?
--
you
'll
*NL*
not
know
the
sooner
,
quoth
Slawkenbergius
,
for
interrupting
me
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
nothing
,
good
Lady

but
empty
bottles

says
the

*NL*
*NL*
`
I

loaded
with

says
the

*NL*
*NL*

And
thou
art
little
better

quoth
she
to
the
third
;
for
nothing
is
*NL*
there
in
thy
panniers
but
trunk-hose
and
pantofles
--
and
so
to
the
fourth
*NL*
and
fifth
,
going
on
one
by
one
through
the
whole
string
,
till
coming
to
*NL*
the
asse
which
carries
it
,
she
turns
the
pannier
upside
down
,
looks
at
*NL*
it
--
considers
it
--
samples
it
--
measures
it

stretches
it

wets
it

dries
*NL*
it

then
takes
her
teeth
both
to

Of

for

We
live
in
a
world
beset
on
all
sides
with
mysteries
and
riddles
--
and
*NL*
so
't
is
no
matter

else
it
seems
strange
,
that
Nature
,
who
makes
every
*NL*
thing
so
well
to
answer
its
destination
,
and
seldom
or
never
errs
,
*NL*
unless
for
pastime
,
in
giving
such
forms
and
aptitudes
to
whatever
*NL*
passes
through
her
hands
,
that
whether
she
designs
for
the
plough
,
the
*NL*
caravan
,
the
cart
--
or
whatever
other
creature
she
models
,
be
it
but
an
*NL*
asse

foal
,
you
are
sure
to
have
the
thing
you
wanted
;
and
yet
at
the
*NL*
same
time
should
so
eternally
bungle
it
as
she
does
,
in
making
so
simple
*NL*
a
thing
as
a
married
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
is
in
the
choice
of
the
clay
--
or
that
it
is
frequently
*NL*
spoiled
in
the
baking
;
by
an
excess
of
which
a
husband
may
turn
out
too
*NL*
crusty
-LRB-
you
know
-RRB-
on
one
hand
--
or
not
enough
so
,
through
defect
of
heat
,
*NL*
on

or
whether
this
great
Artificer
is
not
so
attentive
to
the
*NL*
little
Platonic
exigences
of
that
part
of
the
species
,
for
whose
use
she
*NL*
is
fabricating
this
--
or
that
her
Ladyship
sometimes
scarce
knows
what
*NL*
sort
of
a
husband
will
do
--
I
know
not
:
we
will
discourse
about
it
after
*NL*
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
enough
,
that
neither
the
observation
itself
,
or
the
reasoning
upon
*NL*
it
,
are
at
all
to
the
purpose
--
but
rather
against
it
;
since
with
regard
*NL*
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
fitness
for
the
marriage
state
,
nothing
was
ever
*NL*
better
:
she
had
formed
him
of
the
best
and
kindliest
clay
--
had
temper
'd
*NL*
it
with
her
own
milk
,
and
breathed
into
it
the
sweetest
spirit
--
she
had
*NL*
made
him
all
gentle
,
generous
,
and
humane
--
she
had
filled
his
heart
with
*NL*
trust
and
confidence
,
and
disposed
every
passage
which
led
to
it
,
for
*NL*
the
communication
of
the
tenderest
offices
--
she
had
moreover
considered
*NL*
the
other
causes
for
which
matrimony
was
ordained
--
*NL*
*NL*
And
accordingly
...
*NL*

The
Donation
was
not
defeated
by
my
uncle
Toby
's
wound

Now
this

apocryphal
;
and
the

had
raised
scruples
in
Mrs.

about
it
;

like
a
true

he
was

had
done
his

work
at

by
turning

Mrs.

had
pawn
'd
all
the
little
stock
of
honour
a
poor
*NL*
chamber-maid
was
worth
in
the
world
,
that
she
would
get
to
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
affair
in
ten
days
;
and
it
was
built
upon
one
of
the
most
*NL*
concessible
postulata
in
nature
:
namely
,
that
whilst
my
uncle
Toby
was
*NL*
making
love
to
her
mistress
,
the
corporal
could
find
nothing
better
to
*NL*
do
,
than
make
love
to
her
--

And
I
'll
let
him
as
much
as
he
will
,
said
*NL*
Bridget
,
to
get
it
out
of
him

Bridget
was

serving
her

in
the
one
--
and
doing
the
thing
which
*NL*
most
pleased
herself
in
the
other
:
so
had
as
many
stakes
depending
*NL*
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
wound
,
as
the
Devil
himself
--
Mrs.
Wadman
had
but
*NL*
one
--
and
as
it
possibly
might
be
her
last
-LRB-
without
discouraging
Mrs.
*NL*
Bridget
,
or
discrediting
her
talents
-RRB-
was
determined
to
play
her
cards
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
not
encouragement
:
a
child
might
have
look
'd
into
his
*NL*
hand
--
there
was
such
a
plainness
and
simplicity
in
his
playing
out
what
*NL*
trumps
he
had
--
with
such
an
unmistrusting
ignorance
of
the
ten-ace
--
and
*NL*
so
naked
and
defenceless
did
he
sit
upon
the
same
sopha
with
widow

Wadman

a
generous
heart
would
have
wept

have
won

And
the

too

if
you
please

for
though
I
have
all

been
*NL*
hastening
towards
this

with
so
much
earnest
desire
,
as
*NL*
well
knowing
it
to
be
the
choicest
morsel
of
what
I
had
to
offer
to
the
*NL*
world
,
yet
now
that
I
am
got
to
it
,
any
one
is
welcome
to
take
my
pen
,
*NL*
and
go
on
with
the
story
for
me
that
will
--
I
see
the
difficulties
of
the
*NL*
descriptions
I
'm
going
to
give
--
and
feel
my
want

powers

It
is
one
comfort
at

to
me

that
I
lost
some
fourscore
ounces

of
blood
this

in
a
most
uncritical
fever
which
attacked
me
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
this
chapter

so
that
I
have
still
some
hopes
remaining
,
*NL*
it
may
be
more
in
the
serous
or
globular
parts
of
the
blood
,
than
in
the
*NL*
subtile
aura
of
the
brain
--
be
it
which
it
will
--
an
Invocation
can
do
no
*NL*
hurt

and
I
leave
the
affair
entirely
to
the
invoked
,
to
inspire
or
to
*NL*
inject
me
according
as
he
sees
good

Gentle

Cervantes

who
glidedst
daily
through

lattice

*NL*
turned
`
st
the
twilight
of
his
prison
into
noon-day
brightness
by
thy
*NL*
presence

tinged
`

his
little
urn
of
water
with
heaven-sent
nectar

and
*NL*
all
the
time
he
wrote
of
Sancho

his
master

didst
cast
thy
mystic
*NL*
mantle
o'er

wither

never

six

a
cunning
gypsey
of
a
laundress
at
Milan
cut
me
off
the
fore-laps
of
*NL*
five

To
do
her
justice

she
did
it
with
some
consideration

for

was

returning

And

notwithstanding
all

a

tinder-box

filch

not

you
get
a
sisterly
kiss

worth

at

I
*NL*
did

--
For
my
uncle
Toby
's
amours
running
all
the
way
in
my
head
,
they
had
*NL*
the
same
effect
upon
me
as
if
they
had
been
my
own
--
I
was
in
the
most
*NL*
perfect
state
of
bounty
and
good-will
;
and
felt
the
kindliest
harmony
*NL*
vibrating
within
me
,
with
every
oscillation
of
the
chaise
alike
;
so
that
*NL*
whether
the
roads
were
rough
or
smooth
,
it
made
no
difference
;
every
*NL*
thing
I
saw
or
had
to
do
with
,
touch
'd
upon
some
secret
spring
either
of
*NL*
sentiment
or
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
were
the
sweetest
notes
I
ever
heard
;
and
I
instantly
let
down
*NL*
the
fore-glass
to
hear
them
more
distinctly
--
'T
is
Maria
;
said
the
*NL*
postillion
,
observing
I
was
listening
--
Poor
Maria
,
continued
he
-LRB-
leaning
*NL*
his
body
on
one
side
to
let
me
see
her
,
for
he
was
in
a
line
betwixt
*NL*
us
-RRB-
,
is
sitting
upon
a
bank
playing
her
vespers
upon
her
pipe
,
with
her
*NL*
little
goat
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
fellow
utter
'd
this
with
an
accent
and
a
look
so
perfectly
in
*NL*
tune
to
a
feeling
heart
,
that
I
instantly
made
a
vow
,
I
would
give
him
a
*NL*
four-and-twenty
sous
piece
,
when
I
got
to
Moulins
--
*NL*
*NL*

And
who
is
poor
Maria
?
said
I
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
love
and
piety
of
all
the
villages
around
us
;
said
the
*NL*
postillion
--
it
is
but
three
years
ago
,
that
the
sun
did
not
shine
upon
*NL*
so
fair
,
so
quick-witted
and
amiable
a
maid
;
and
better
fate
did
Maria
*NL*
deserve
,
than
to
have
her
Banns
forbid
,
by
the
intrigues
of
the
curate
*NL*
of
the
parish
who
published
them
--
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
going
on
,
when
Maria
,
who
had
made
a
short
pause
,
put
the
pipe
to
*NL*
her
mouth
,
and
began
the
air
again
--
they
were
the
same
notes
;
--
yet
were
*NL*
ten
times
sweeter
:
It
is
the
evening
service
to
the
Virgin
,
said
the
*NL*
young
man
--
but
who
has
taught
her
to
play
it
--
or
how
she
came
by
her
*NL*
pipe
,
no
one
knows
;
we
think
that
heaven
has
assisted
her
in
both
;
*NL*
for
ever
since
she
has
been
unsettled
in
her
mind
,
it
seems
her
only
*NL*
consolation
--
she
has
never
once
had
the
pipe
out
of
her
hand
,
but
plays
*NL*
that
service
upon
it
almost
night
and
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
postillion
delivered
this
with
so
much
discretion
and
natural
*NL*
eloquence
,
that
I
could
not
help
decyphering
something
in
his
face
above
*NL*
his
condition
,
and
should
have
sifted
out
his
history
,
had
not
poor
*NL*
Maria
taken
such
full
possession
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
got
up
by
this
time
almost
to
the
bank
where
Maria
was
sitting
:
*NL*
she
was
in
a
thin
white
jacket
,
with
her
hair
,
all
but
two
tresses
,
*NL*
drawn
up
into
a
silk-net
,
with
a
few
olive
leaves
twisted
a
little
*NL*
fantastically
on
one
side
--
she
was
beautiful
;
and
if
ever
I
felt
the
*NL*
full
force
of
an
honest
heart-ache
,
it
was
the
moment
I
saw
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
God
help
her
!
poor
damsel
!
above
a
hundred
masses
,
said
the
*NL*
postillion
,
have
been
said
in
the
several
parish
churches
and
convents
*NL*
around
,
for
her
,
--
but
without
effect
;
we
have
still
hopes
,
as
she
is
*NL*
sensible
for
short
intervals
,
that
the
Virgin
at
last
will
restore
her
*NL*
to
herself
;
but
her
parents
,
who
know
her
best
,
are
hopeless
upon
that
*NL*
score
,
and
think
her
senses
are
lost
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
postillion
spoke
this
,
Maria
made
a
cadence
so
melancholy
,
so
*NL*
tender
and
querulous
,
that
I
sprung
out
of
the
chaise
to
help
her
,
and
*NL*
found
myself
sitting
betwixt
her
and
her
goat
before
I
relapsed
from
my
*NL*
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
look
'd
wistfully
for
some
time
at
me
,
and
then
at
her
goat
--
and
*NL*
then
at
me
--
and
then
at
her
goat
again
,
and
so
on
,
alternately
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Well
,
Maria
,
said
I
softly
--
What
resemblance
do
you
find
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
entreat
the
candid
reader
to
believe
me
,
that
it
was
from
the
*NL*
humblest
conviction
of
what
a
Beast
man
is
,
--
that
I
asked
the
question
;
*NL*
and
that
I
would
not
have
let
fallen
an
unseasonable
pleasantry
in
the
*NL*
venerable
presence
of
Misery
,
to
be
entitled
to
all
the
wit
that
ever
*NL*
Rabelais
scatter
'd
--
and
yet
I
own
my
heart
smote
me
,
and
that
I
so
*NL*
smarted
at
the
very
idea
of
it
,
that
I
swore
I
would
set
up
for
Wisdom
,
*NL*
and
utter
grave
sentences
the
rest
of
my
days
--
and
never
--
never
attempt
*NL*
again
to
commit
mirth
with
man
,
woman
,
or
child
,
the
longest
day
I
had
*NL*
to
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
writing
nonsense
to
them
--
I
believe
there
was
a
reserve
--
but
that
*NL*
I
leave
to
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Adieu
,
Maria
!
--
adieu
,
poor
hapless
damsel
!
--
some
time
,
but
not
now
,
I
*NL*
may
hear
thy
sorrows
from
thy
own
lips
--
but
I
was
deceived
;
for
that
*NL*
moment
she
took
her
pipe
and
told
me
such
a
tale
of
woe
with
it
,
that
I
*NL*
rose
up
,
and
with
broken
and
irregular
steps
walk
'd
softly
to
my
chaise
.

*NL*
*NL*
When
we
have
got
to
the
end
of
this
chapter
-LRB-
but
not
before
-RRB-
we
must
all
*NL*
turn
back
to
the
two
blank
chapters
,
on
the
account
of
which
my
honour
*NL*
has
lain
bleeding
this
half
hour
--
I
stop
it
,
by
pulling
off
one
of
my
*NL*
yellow
slippers
and
throwing
it
with
all
my
violence
to
the
opposite
*NL*
side
of
my
room
,
with
a
declaration
at
the
heel
of
it
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
whatever
resemblance
it
may
bear
to
half
the
chapters
which
are
*NL*
written
in
the
world
,
or
for
aught
I
know
may
be
now
writing
in
it
--
that
*NL*
it
was
as
casual
as
the
foam
of
Zeuxis
his
horse
;
besides
,
I
look
upon
a
*NL*
chapter
which
has
only
nothing
in
it
,
with
respect
;
and
considering
what
*NL*
worse
things
there
are
in
the
world
--
That
it
is
no
way
a
proper
subject
*NL*
for
satire
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Why
then
was
it
left
so
?
And
here
without
staying
for
my
reply
,
shall
*NL*
I
be
called
as
many
blockheads
,
numsculs
,
doddypoles
,
dunderheads
,
*NL*
ninny-hammers
,
goosecaps
,
joltheads
,
nincompoops
,
and
sh..t-a-beds
--
and
*NL*
other
unsavoury
appellations
,
as
ever
the
cake-bakers
of
Lerne
cast
in
*NL*
the
teeth
of
King
Garangantan
's
shepherds
--
And
I
'll
let
them
do
it
,
*NL*
as
Bridget
said
,
as
much
as
they
please
;
for
how
was
it
possible
they
*NL*
should
foresee
the
necessity
I
was
under
of
writing
the
84th
chapter
of
*NL*
my
book
,
before
the
77th
,
&

*NL*

So
I
do
n't
take
it
amiss
--
All
I
wish
is
,
that
it
may
be
a
lesson
to
*NL*
the
world
,
`
to
let
people
tell
their

The
Seventy-seventh
Chapter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Mrs.
Bridget
opened
the
door
before
the
corporal
had
well
given
the
*NL*
rap
,
the
interval
betwixt
that
and
my
uncle
Toby
's
introduction
into
the
*NL*
parlour
,
was
so
short
,
that
Mrs.
Wadman
had
but
just
time
to
get
from
*NL*
behind
the
curtain
--
lay
a
Bible
upon
the
table
,
and
advance
a
step
or
*NL*
two
towards
the
door
to
receive
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
saluted
Mrs.
Wadman
,
after
the
manner
in
which
women
were
*NL*
saluted
by
men
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
God
one
thousand
seven
hundred
*NL*
and
thirteen
--
then
facing
about
,
he
march
'd
up
abreast
with
her
to
the
*NL*
sopha
,
and
in
three
plain
words
--
though
not
before
he
was
sat
down
--
nor
*NL*
after
he
was
sat
down
--
but
as
he
was
sitting
down
,
told
her
,
`
he
was
in
*NL*
love
'
--
so
that
my
uncle
Toby
strained
himself
more
in
the
declaration
*NL*
than
he
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wadman
naturally
looked
down
,
upon
a
slit
she
had
been
darning
up
*NL*
in
her
apron
,
in
expectation
every
moment
,
that
my
uncle
Toby
would
go
*NL*
on
;
but
having
no
talents
for
amplification
,
and
Love
moreover
of
all
*NL*
others
being
a
subject
of
which
he
was
the
least
a
master
--
When
he
had
*NL*
told
Mrs.
Wadman
once
that
he
loved
her
,
he
let
it
alone
,
and
left
the
*NL*
matter
to
work
after
its
own
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
was
always
in
raptures
with
this
system
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
,
as
*NL*
he
falsely
called
it
,
and
would
often
say
,
that
could
his
brother
Toby
*NL*
to
his
processe
have
added
but
a
pipe
of
tobacco
--
he
had
wherewithal
to
*NL*
have
found
his
way
,
if
there
was
faith
in
a
Spanish
proverb
,
towards
the
*NL*
hearts
of
half
the
women
upon
the
globe
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
never
understood
what
my
father
meant
;
nor
will
I
presume
*NL*
to
extract
more
from
it
,
than
a
condemnation
of
an
error
which
the
bulk
*NL*
of
the
world
lie
under
--
but
the
French
,
every
one
of
'em
to
a
man
,
who
*NL*
believe
in
it
,
almost
as
much
as
the
Real
Presence
,
`
That
talking
of
*NL*
love
,
is
making
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
--
I
would
as
soon
set
about
making
a
black-pudding
by
the
same
receipt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
go
on
:
Mrs.
Wadman
sat
in
expectation
my
uncle
Toby
would
do
so
,
*NL*
to
almost
the
first
pulsation
of
that
minute
,
wherein
silence
on
one
*NL*
side
or
the
other
,
generally
becomes
indecent
:
so
edging
herself
a
*NL*
little
more
towards
him
,
and
raising
up
her
eyes
,
sub
blushing
,
as
*NL*
she
did
it
--
she
took
up
the
gauntlet
--
or
the
discourse
-LRB-
if
you
like
it
*NL*
better
-RRB-
and
communed
with
my
uncle
Toby
,
thus
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
cares
and
disquietudes
of
the
marriage
state
,
quoth
Mrs.
Wadman
,
*NL*
are
very
great
.
I
suppose
so
--
said
my
uncle
Toby
:
and
therefore
when
*NL*
a
person
,
continued
Mrs.
Wadman
,
is
so
much
at
his
ease
as
you
are
--
so
*NL*
happy
,
captain
Shandy
,
in
yourself
,
your
friends
and
your
amusements
--
I
*NL*
wonder
,
what
reasons
can
incline
you
to
the
state
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
They
are
written
,
quoth
my
uncle
Toby
,
in
the
Common-Prayer
Book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
far
my
uncle
Toby
went
on
warily
,
and
kept
within
his
depth
,
*NL*
leaving
Mrs.
Wadman
to
sail
upon
the
gulph
as
she
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
As
for
children
--
said
Mrs.
Wadman
--
though
a
principal
end
perhaps
of
*NL*
the
institution
,
and
the
natural
wish
,
I
suppose
,
of
every
parent
--
yet
*NL*
do
not
we
all
find
,
they
are
certain
sorrows
,
and
very
uncertain
*NL*
comforts
?
and
what
is
there
,
dear
sir
,
to
pay
one
for
the
*NL*
heart-achs
--
what
compensation
for
the
many
tender
and
disquieting
*NL*
apprehensions
of
a
suffering
and
defenceless
mother
who
brings
them
into
*NL*
life
?
I
declare
,
said
my
uncle
Toby
,
smit
with
pity
,
I
know
of
none
;
*NL*
unless
it
be
the
pleasure
which
it
has
pleased
God
--

A

Now
there
are
such
an
infinitude
of
notes
,
tunes
,
cants
,
chants
,
airs
,
*NL*
looks
,
and
accents
with
which
the
word
fiddlestick
may
be
pronounced
in
*NL*
all
such
causes
as
this
,
every
one
of
'em
impressing
a
sense
and
meaning
*NL*
as
different
from
the
other
,
as
dirt
from
cleanliness
--
That
Casuists
*NL*
-LRB-
for
it
is
an
affair
of
conscience
on
that
score
-RRB-
reckon
up
no
less
than
*NL*
fourteen
thousand
in
which
you
may
do
either
right
or
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Wadman
hit
upon
the
fiddlestick
,
which
summoned
up
all
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
's
modest
blood
into
his
cheeks
--
so
feeling
within
himself
that
he
*NL*
had
somehow
or
other
got
beyond
his
depth
,
he
stopt
short
;
and
without
*NL*
entering
further
either
into
the
pains
or
pleasures
of
matrimony
,
he
*NL*
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
made
an
offer
to
take
them
as
they
*NL*
were
,
and
share
them
along
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
my
uncle
Toby
had
said
this
,
he
did
not
care
to
say
it
again
;
*NL*
so
casting
his
eye
upon
the
Bible
which
Mrs.
Wadman
had
laid
upon
the
*NL*
table
,
he
took
it
up
;
and
popping
,
dear
soul
!
upon
a
passage
in
it
,
*NL*
of
all
others
the
most
interesting
to
him
--
which
was
the
siege
of
*NL*
Jericho
--
he
set
himself
to
read
it
over
--
leaving
his
proposal
of
*NL*
marriage
,
as
he
had
done
his
declaration
of
love
,
to
work
with
her
after
*NL*
its
own
way
.
Now
it
wrought
neither
as
an
astringent
or
a
loosener
;
nor
*NL*
like
opium
,
or
bark
,
or
mercury
,
or
buckthorn
,
or
any
one
drug
which
*NL*
nature
had
bestowed
upon
the
world
--
in
short
,
it
work
'd
not
at
all
in
*NL*
her
;
and
the
cause
of
that
was
,
that
there
was
something
working
there
*NL*
before
--
Babbler
that
I
am

I
have
anticipated
what
it
was
a
dozen
times

there
is

Chapter

LXXXV
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
natural
for
a
perfect
stranger
who
is
going
from
London
to
*NL*
Edinburgh
,
to
enquire
before
he
sets
out
,
how
many
miles
to
York
;
which
*NL*
is
about
the
half
way
--
nor
does
any
body
wonder
,
if
he
goes
on
and
asks
*NL*
about
the
corporation
,
&
c.
...
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
as
natural
for
Mrs.
Wadman
,
whose
first
husband
was
all
his
*NL*
time
afflicted
with
a
Sciatica
,
to
wish
to
know
how
far
from
the
hip
*NL*
to
the
groin
;
and
how
far
she
was
likely
to
suffer
more
or
less
in
her
*NL*
feelings
,
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
accordingly
read
Drake
's
anatomy
from
one
end
to
the
other
.
She
*NL*
had
peeped
into
Wharton
upon
the
brain
,
and
borrowed
Graaf
-LRB-
This
must
be
*NL*
a
mistake
in
Mr.
Shandy
;
for
Graaf
wrote
upon
the
pancreatick
juice
,
*NL*
and
the
parts
of
generation
.
-RRB-
upon
the
bones
and
muscles
;
but
could
make
*NL*
nothing
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
reason
'd
likewise
from
her
own
powers
--
laid
down
theorems
--
drawn
*NL*
consequences
,
and
come
to
no
conclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
clear
up
all
,
she
had
twice
asked
Doctor
Slop
,
`
if
poor
captain
*NL*
Shandy
was
ever
likely
to
recover
of
his
wound
--
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
--
He
is
recovered
,
Doctor
Slop
would
say
--
*NL*
*NL*
What
!
quite
?
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
:
madam
--
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
do
you
mean
by
a
recovery
?
Mrs.
Wadman
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Doctor
Slop
was
the
worst
man
alive
at
definitions
;
and
so
Mrs.
Wadman
*NL*
could
get
no
knowledge
:
in
short
,
there
was
no
way
to
extract
it
,
but
*NL*
from
my
uncle
Toby
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
an
accent
of
humanity
in
an
enquiry
of
this
kind
which
lulls
*NL*
Suspicion
to
rest
--
and
I
am
half
persuaded
the
serpent
got
pretty
near
*NL*
it
,
in
his
discourse
with
Eve
;
for
the
propensity
in
the
sex
to
be
*NL*
deceived
could
not
be
so
great
,
that
she
should
have
boldness
to
hold
*NL*
chat
with
the
devil
,
without
it
--
But
there
is
an
accent
of
humanity
--
how
*NL*
shall
I
describe
it
?
--
't
is
an
accent
which
covers
the
part
with
a
*NL*
garment
,
and
gives
the
enquirer
a
right
to
be
as
particular
with
it
,
as
*NL*
your
body-surgeon
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
Was
it
without
remission
?
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
--
Was
it
more
tolerable
in
bed
?
*NL*
*NL*
'
--

et

were
so
tenderly
spoke
to
,
and
so
*NL*
directed
towards
my
uncle
Toby
's
heart
,
that
every
item
of
them
sunk
*NL*
ten
times
deeper
into
it
than
the
evils
themselves
--
but
when
Mrs.
Wadman
*NL*
went
round
about
by
Namur
to
get
at
my
uncle
Toby
's
groin
;
and
engaged
*NL*
him
to
attack
the
point
of
the
advanced
counterscarp
,
and
pele
mele
with
*NL*
the
Dutch
to
take
the
counterguard
of
St.
Roch
sword
in
hand
--
and
then
*NL*
with
tender
notes
playing
upon
his
ear
,
led
him
all
bleeding
by
the
*NL*
hand
out
of
the
trench
,
wiping
her
eye
,
as
he
was
carried
to
his
*NL*
tent
--
Heaven
!
Earth
!
Sea
!
--
all
was
lifted
up
--
the
springs
of
nature
rose
*NL*
above
their
levels
--
an
angel
of
mercy
sat
besides
him
on
the
sopha
--
his
*NL*
heart
glow
'd
with
fire
--
and
had
he
been
worth
a
thousand
,
he
had
lost
*NL*
every
heart
of
them
to
Mrs.
Wadman
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
And
whereabouts
,
dear
sir
,
quoth
Mrs.
Wadman
,
a
little
categorically
,
*NL*
did
you
receive
this
sad
blow
?
--
In
asking
this
question
,
Mrs.
Wadman
*NL*
gave
a
slight
glance
towards
the
waistband
of
my
uncle
Toby
's
red
plush
*NL*
breeches
,
expecting
naturally
,
as
the
shortest
reply
to
it
,
that
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
would
lay
his
fore-finger
upon
the
place
--
It
fell
out
*NL*
otherwise
--
for
my
uncle
Toby
having
got
his
wound
before
the
gate
of
St.
*NL*
Nicolas
,
in
one
of
the
traverses
of
the
trench
opposite
to
the
salient
*NL*
angle
of
the
demibastion
of
St.
Roch
;
he
could
at
any
time
stick
a
pin
*NL*
upon
the
identical
spot
of
ground
where
he
was
standing
when
the
stone
*NL*
struck
him
:
this
struck
instantly
upon
my
uncle
Toby
's
sensorium
--
and
*NL*
with
it
,
struck
his
large
map
of
the
town
and
citadel
of
Namur
and
its
*NL*
environs
,
which
he
had
purchased
and
pasted
down
upon
a
board
,
by
the
*NL*
corporal
's
aid
,
during
his
long
illness
--
it
had
lain
with
other
military
*NL*
lumber
in
the
garret
ever
since
,
and
accordingly
the
corporal
was
*NL*
detached
to
the
garret
to
fetch
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
uncle
Toby
measured
off
thirty
toises
,
with
Mrs.
Wadman
's
scissars
,
*NL*
from
the
returning
angle
before
the
gate
of
St.
Nicolas
;
and
with
such
*NL*
a
virgin
modesty
laid
her
finger
upon
the
place
,
that
the
goddess
of
*NL*
Decency
,
if
then
in
being
--
if
not
,
't
was
her
shade
--
shook
her
head
,
*NL*
and
with
a
finger
wavering
across
her
eyes
--
forbid
her
to
explain
the
*NL*
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unhappy
Mrs.
Wadman
!
*NL*
*NL*
--
For
nothing
can
make
this
chapter
go
off
with
spirit
but
an
apostrophe
*NL*
to
thee
--
but
my
heart
tells
me
,
that
in
such
a
crisis
an
apostrophe
*NL*
is
but
an
insult
in
disguise
,
and
ere
I
would
offer
one
to
a
woman
in
*NL*
distress
--
let
the
chapter
go
to
the
devil
;
provided
any

critic
in

keeping
will
be
but
at

trouble
to
take
it
with

And

the

pointing
with

extended
a
little
towards
the

,
and
his
*NL*
left
upon

not
the

him

this

there

Mrs.

,
quoth
the
corporal
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
,
did
he
*NL*
receive
the
wound
which
crush
'd
him
so
miserably
here
.
--
In
pronouncing
*NL*
which
,
he
slightly
press
'd
the
back
of
her
hand
towards
the
part
he
felt
*NL*
for
--
and
let
it
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
thought
,
Mr.
Trim
,
it
had
been
more
in

--
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Bridget
--
*NL*
*NL*
That

have
undone

said
the
corporal
.

And
left
my
poor
mistress
undone
too

said
Bridget

*NL*
The
corporal
made
no
reply
to
the
repartee
,
but
by
giving
Mrs.
Bridget
a
*NL*
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Come

--
said
Bridget
--
holding
the
palm
of
her
left
hand
parallel
to
*NL*
the
plane
of
the
horizon
,
and
sliding
the
fingers
of
the

over
it
,
*NL*
in
a

which
could
not
have
been
done
,
had
there
been
the
least
wart
*NL*
or

--
'T
is

cried
the

*NL*
before
she
had
half
finished
the
sentence
--

*NL*
--
I
know
it
to
be

said
Bridget
,
from
credible
witnesses
.

*NL*
--
Upon
my
honour
,
said
the
corporal
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
*NL*
and
blushing
,
as
he
spoke
,
with
honest
resentment
--
't
is
a
story
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Bridget
,
as
false
as
hell
--
Not
,
said
Bridget
,
interrupting
him
,
that
*NL*
either
I
or
my
mistress
care
a
halfpenny
about
it
,
whether
't
is
so
or
*NL*
no

only
that
when

is

would
chuse
to
have
such
a
thing
*NL*
by

at

--

It
was
somewhat
unfortunate
for

It
was

momentary
contest
in

moist
eye-lids
of

April
*NL*

,
`
Whether

should
laugh

snatch

up

She
laid

down

she
cried

had
one
single
tear
of
'em

tasted
*NL*
of
bitterness
,
full
sorrowful
would
the
corporal
's
heart
have
been
that
*NL*
he
had
used
the
argument
;

the
corporal
understood
the
sex

a
quart
*NL*
major
to
a
terce
at

,
better
than
my
uncle
Toby
,
and
accordingly
he
*NL*
assailed
Mrs.
Bridget
after
this
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know

Mrs.
Bridget

said
the
corporal
,
giving
her
a
most
respectful
*NL*
kiss
,
that
thou
art
good
and
modest
by
nature
,
and
art
withal
so
*NL*
generous
a
girl
in
thyself
,
that
,
if
I
know
thee
rightly

thou
would
`
st
*NL*
not
wound
an
insect

much
less
the
honour
of
so
gallant
and
worthy
a
*NL*
soul
as
my
master
,
wast
thou
sure
to
be
made
a
countess
of

but
thou
*NL*
hast
been
set
on
,
and
deluded
,
dear
Bridget

as
is
often
a
woman
's
case
,
*NL*
`
to
please
others
more
than
themselves

'
*NL*
*NL*
Bridget
's
eyes
poured
down
at
the
sensations
the
corporal
excited
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Tell
me
--
tell
me
,
then
,
my
dear
Bridget
,
continued
the
corporal
,
*NL*
taking
hold
of
her
hand
,
which
hung
down
dead
by
her
side
,
--
and
giving
a
*NL*
second
kiss
--
whose
suspicion

misled
thee
?
*NL*
*NL*
Bridget
sobb
'd
a
sob

the

wiped

'em
with

My
uncle
Toby
and
the
corporal
had
gone
on
separately
with
their
*NL*
operations
the
greatest
part
of
the
campaign
,
and
as
effectually
cut
*NL*
off
from
all
communication
of
what
either
the
one
or
the
other
had
been
*NL*
doing

My

had
presented
himself
every

in

*NL*
red

silver
,

blue
and
gold
alternately
,
and
sustained
an
infinity
*NL*
of
attacks
in
them
,
without
knowing
them
to
be
attacks
--
and
so
had
*NL*
nothing
to
communicate

*NL*
*NL*
The
corporal
,
on
his
side

in
taking
Bridget
,
by
it
had
gain
'd
*NL*
considerable
advantages
--
and
consequently
had
much
to
communicate

but
*NL*
what
were
the
advantages
--
as
well
as
what
was
the
manner
by
which
he
had
*NL*
seiz
'd
them
,
required
so
nice
an
historian
,
that
the
corporal
durst
not
*NL*
venture
upon
it
;
and
as
sensible
as
he
was
of
glory
,
would
rather
have
*NL*
been
contented
to
have
gone
bareheaded
and
without
laurels
for
ever

torture
his

counting
over

ends

beginning
at

-RRB-
all
Mrs.
Wadman
's

one

;

happening
two
or
*NL*
three
times
together
,
either
by
omitting
some
,
or
counting
others
twice
*NL*
over
,
to
puzzle
himself
sadly
before
he
could
get
beyond
his
middle
*NL*
finger
--
Prithee

said
he
,
taking
up
his
pipe
again

bring
me
a

pen

ink

Trim
brought
paper
also

making
a
sign
with
his
pipe
*NL*
at

time
to
take
a
chair
and
sit
down
close
by
him
at

obeyed

placed
the
paper

But
they
must
be
taken
in

ranks

replied
my
uncle
Toby
;
for
of
*NL*
them
all
,
Trim
,
that
which
wins
me
most
,
and
which
is
a
security
for
*NL*
all

is
the
compassionate
turn
and
singular
humanity
of
her
*NL*
character

I
protest

added
my

Toby
,
looking
up

as
he
protested
*NL*
it

top

tender
enquiries

no

made
no
reply

protestation

by
a
*NL*
short
cough

he
dipp
'd
the
pen
a
second
time
into

inkhorn

my

uncle
Toby
,
pointing
with
the
end
of
his
pipe
as
close
to
the
top
of
the
*NL*
sheet
at
the
left
hand
corner
of

could
get
it

the

wrote
down

Prithee

said
my

as
soon

Trim
had
done
it
--
how
*NL*

does
Mrs.
Bridget
enquire
after

wound
on

cap
of
thy
knee

*NL*
which
thou
received

at

of

She
never

enquires

That

corporal
,
said
my

Toby
,
with
all
the
triumph
the
goodness
of

his
nature
would
permit
--
That
shews
the
difference
in
the
character
*NL*

mistress

maid

the
fortune
of
war
allotted
the

mischance

me

Mrs.

have
enquired
into

enquired

an

The

Compassion

compassion
to
do
with

wound
upon
the
cap

shot
into

Mrs.

troubled

added
the

lowering
his
voice
,

speaking
very

distinctly
,
as
he
assigned
his
reason
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
knee
is
such
a
distance
from

main
body

whereas
the
groin

your

honour
knows

is
upon

My

whistle

could
scarce

and
Trim
are
walking
to
*NL*
my
father
's
,
to
inform
you
that
Mrs.
Wadman
had
,
some
moons
before
this
,
*NL*
made
a
confident
of
my
mother
;
and
that
Mrs.
Bridget
,
who
had
the
burden
*NL*
of
her
own
,
as
well
as
her
mistress
's
secret
to
carry
,
had
got
happily
*NL*
delivered
of
both
to
Susannah
behind
the
garden-wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
my
mother
,
she
saw
nothing
at
all
in
it
,
to
make
the
least
bustle
*NL*
about
--
but
Susannah
was
sufficient
by
herself
for
all
the
ends
and
*NL*
purposes
you
could
possibly
have
,
in
exporting
a
family
secret
;
for
she
*NL*
instantly
imparted
it
by
signs
to
Jonathan
--
and
Jonathan
by
tokens
to
*NL*
the
cook
as
she
was
basting
a
loin
of
mutton
;
the
cook
sold
it
with
some
*NL*
kitchen-fat
to
the
postillion
for
a
groat
,
who
truck
'd
it
with
the
dairy
*NL*
maid
for
something
of
about
the
same
value
--
and
though
whisper
'd
in
the
*NL*
hay-loft
,
Fame
caught
the
notes
with
her
brazen
trumpet
,
and
sounded
*NL*
them
upon
the
house-top
--
In
a
word
,
not
an
old
woman
in
the
village
or
*NL*
five
miles
round
,
who
did
not
understand
the
difficulties
of
my
uncle
*NL*
Toby
's
siege
,
and
what
were
the
secret
articles
which
had
delayed
the
*NL*
surrender
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
whose
way
was
to
force
every
event
in
nature
into
an
*NL*
hypothesis
,
by
which
means
never
man
crucified
Truth
at
the
rate
he
*NL*
did
--
had
but
just
heard
of
the
report
as
my
uncle
Toby
set
out
;
and
*NL*
catching
fire
suddenly
at
the
trespass
done
his
brother
by
it
,
was
*NL*
demonstrating
to
Yorick
,
notwithstanding
my
mother
was
sitting
by
--
not
*NL*
only
,
`
That
the
devil
was
in
women
,
and
that
the
whole
of
the
affair
was
*NL*
lust
;
'
but
that
every
evil
and
disorder
in
the
world
,
of
what
kind
or
*NL*
nature
soever
,
from
the
first
fall
of
Adam
,
down
to
my
uncle
Toby
's
*NL*
-LRB-
inclusive
-RRB-
,
was
owing
one
way
or
other
to
the
same
unruly
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yorick
was
just
bringing
my
father
's
hypothesis
to
some
temper
,
when
*NL*
my
uncle
Toby
entering
the
room
with
marks
of
infinite
benevolence
and
*NL*
forgiveness
in
his
looks
,
my
father
's
eloquence
re-kindled
against
the
*NL*
passion
--
and
as
he
was
not
very
nice
in
the
choice
of
his
words
when
*NL*
he
was
wroth
--
as
soon
as
my
uncle
Toby
was
seated
by
the
fire
,
and
had
*NL*
filled
his
pipe
,
my
father
broke
out
in
this
manner
.

Chapter

XCII
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
That
provision
should
be
made
for
continuing
the
race
of
so
great
,
*NL*
so
exalted
and
godlike
a
Being
as
man
--
I
am
far
from
denying
--
but
*NL*
philosophy
speaks
freely
of
every
thing
;
and
therefore
I
still
think
*NL*
and
do
maintain
it
to
be
a
pity
,
that
it
should
be
done
by
means
of
*NL*
a
passion
which
bends
down
the
faculties
,
and
turns
all
the
wisdom
,
*NL*
contemplations
,
and
operations
of
the
soul
backwards
--
a
passion
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
continued
my
father
,
addressing
himself
to
my
mother
,
which
*NL*
couples
and
equals
wise
men
with
fools
,
and
makes
us
come
out
of
our
*NL*
caverns
and
hiding-places
more
like
satyrs
and
four-footed
beasts
than
*NL*
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
it
will
be
said
,
continued
my
father
-LRB-
availing
himself
of
the
*NL*
Prolepsis
-RRB-
,
that
in
itself
,
and
simply
taken
--
like
hunger
,
or
thirst
,
*NL*
or
sleep
--
't
is
an
affair
neither
good
or
bad
--
or
shameful
or
*NL*
otherwise
.
--
Why
then
did
the
delicacy
of
Diogenes
and
Plato
so
*NL*
recalcitrate
against
it
?
and
wherefore
,
when
we
go
about
to
make
and
*NL*
plant
a
man
,
do
we
put
out
the
candle
?
and
for
what
reason
is
it
,
*NL*
that
all
the
parts
thereof
--
the
congredients
--
the
preparations
--
the
*NL*
instruments
,
and
whatever
serves
thereto
,
are
so
held
as
to
be
conveyed
*NL*
to
a
cleanly
mind
by
no
language
,
translation
,
or
periphrasis
whatever
?
*NL*
*NL*
--
The
act
of
killing
and
destroying
a
man
,
continued
my
father
,
raising
*NL*
his
voice
--
and
turning
to
my
uncle
Toby
--
you
see
,
is
glorious
--
and
the
*NL*
weapons
by
which
we
do
it
are
honourable
--
We
march
with
them
upon
our
*NL*
shoulders
--
We
strut
with
them
by
our
sides
--
We
gild
them
--
We
carve
*NL*
them
--
We
in-lay
them
--
We
enrich
them
--
Nay
,
if
it
be
but
a
scoundrel
*NL*
cannon
,
we
cast
an
ornament
upon
the
breach
of
it
.
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
My
uncle
Toby
laid
down
his
pipe
to
intercede
for
a
better
*NL*
epithet
--
and
Yorick
was
rising
up
to
batter
the
whole
hypothesis
to
*NL*
pieces
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
When
Obadiah
broke
into
the
middle
of
the
room
with
a
complaint
,
which
*NL*
cried
out
for
an
immediate
hearing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
was
this
:
*NL*
*NL*
My
father
,
whether
by
ancient
custom
of
the
manor
,
or
as
impropriator
*NL*
of
the
great
tythes
,
was
obliged
to
keep
a
Bull
for
the
service
of
the
*NL*
Parish
,
and
Obadiah
had
led
his
cow
upon
a
pop-visit
to
him
one
day
or
*NL*
other
the
preceding
summer
--
I
say
,
one
day
or
other
--
because
as
chance
*NL*
would
have
it
,
it
was
the
day
on
which
he
was
married
to
my
father
's
*NL*
house-maid
--
so
one
was
a
reckoning
to
the
other
.
Therefore
when
*NL*
Obadiah
's
wife
was
brought
to
bed
--
Obadiah
thanked
God
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
Now
,
said
Obadiah
,
I
shall
have
a
calf
:
so
Obadiah
went
daily
to
visit
*NL*
his
cow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
'll
calve
on
Monday
--
on
Tuesday
--
on
Wednesday
at
the
farthest
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
cow
did
not
calve
--
no
--
she
'll
not
calve
till
next
week
--
the
cow
put
*NL*
it
off
terribly
--
till
at
the
end
of
the
sixth
week
Obadiah
's
suspicions
*NL*
-LRB-
like
a
good
man
's
-RRB-
fell
upon
the
Bull
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
parish
being
very
large
,
my
father
's
Bull
,
to
speak
the
truth
of
*NL*
him
,
was
no
way
equal
to
the
department
;
he
had
,
however
,
got
himself
,
*NL*
somehow
or
other
,
thrust
into
employment
--
and
as
he
went
through
the
*NL*
business
with
a
grave
face
,
my
father
had
a
high
opinion
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
--
Most
of
the
townsmen
,
an
'
please
your
worship
,
quoth
Obadiah
,
believe
*NL*
that
't
is
all
the
Bull
's
fault
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
But
may
not
a
cow
be
barren
?
replied
my
father
,
turning
to
Doctor
*NL*
Slop
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
never
happens
:
said
Dr.
Slop
,
but
the
man
's
wife
may
have
come
*NL*
before
her
time
naturally
enough
--
Prithee
has
the
child
hair
upon
his
*NL*
head
?
--
added
Dr.
Slop
--
*NL*
*NL*
--
It
is
as
hairy
as
I
am
;
said
Obadiah
.
--
Obadiah
had
not
been
shaved
for
*NL*
three
weeks
--
Wheu
...
u.
.
.
u.
.
.
cried
my
father
;
beginning
the
sentence
with
*NL*
an
exclamatory
whistle
--
and
so
,
brother
Toby
,
this
poor
Bull
of
mine
,
*NL*
who
is
as
good
a
Bull
as
ever
p.
.
ss
'd
,
and
might
have
done
for
Europa
*NL*
herself
in
purer
times
--
had
he
but
two
legs
less
,
might
have
been
driven
*NL*
into
Doctors
Commons
and
lost
his
character
--
which
to
a
Town
Bull
,
*NL*
brother
Toby
,
is
the
very
same
thing
as
his
life
--
*NL*
*NL*
L.

said
my
mother
,
what
is
all
this
story
about
?
--
*NL*
*NL*
A
Cock
and
a
Bull
,
said
Yorick
--
And
one
of
the
best
of
its
kind
,
I
ever
*NL*
heard
