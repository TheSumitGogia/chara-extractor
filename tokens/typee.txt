A
ROMANCE
OF
THE
SOUTH
SEAS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
Herman
Melville
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
MORE
than
three
years
have
elapsed
since
the
occurrence
of
the
events
*NL*
recorded
in
this
volume
.
The
interval
,
with
the
exception
of
the
last
*NL*
few
months
,
has
been
chiefly
spent
by
the
author
tossing
about
on
*NL*
the
wide
ocean
.
Sailors
are
the
only
class
of
men
who
now-a-days
see
*NL*
anything
like
stirring
adventure
;
and
many
things
which
to
fire-side
*NL*
people
appear
strange
and
romantic
,
to
them
seem
as
common-place
as
a
*NL*
jacket
out
at
elbows
.
Yet
,
notwithstanding
the
familiarity
of
sailors
*NL*
with
all
sorts
of
curious
adventure
,
the
incidents
recorded
in
the
*NL*
following
pages
have
often
served
,
when
`
spun
as
a
yarn
,
'
not
only
to
*NL*
relieve
the
weariness
of
many
a
night-watch
at
sea
,
but
to
excite
the
*NL*
warmest
sympathies
of
the
author
's
shipmates
.
He
has
been
,
therefore
,
*NL*
led
to
think
that
his
story
could
scarcely
fail
to
interest
those
who
*NL*
are
less
familiar
than
the
sailor
with
a
life
of
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
account
of
the
singular
and
interesting
people
among
whom
he
was
*NL*
thrown
,
it
will
be
observed
that
he
chiefly
treats
of
their
more
obvious
*NL*
peculiarities
;
and
,
in
describing
their
customs
,
refrains
in
most
cases
*NL*
from
entering
into
explanations
concerning
their
origin
and
purposes
.
*NL*
As
writers
of
travels
among
barbarous
communities
are
generally
very
*NL*
diffuse
on
these
subjects
,
he
deems
it
right
to
advert
to
what
may
be
*NL*
considered
a
culpable
omission
.
No
one
can
be
more
sensible
than
the
*NL*
author
of
his
deficiencies
in
this
and
many
other
respects
;
but
when
the
*NL*
very
peculiar
circumstances
in
which
he
was
placed
are
understood
,
he
*NL*
feels
assured
that
all
these
omissions
will
be
excused
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
very
many
published
narratives
no
little
degree
of
attention
is
*NL*
bestowed
upon
dates
;
but
as
the
author
lost
all
knowledge
of
the
days
of
*NL*
the
week
,
during
the
occurrence
of
the
scenes
herein
related
,
he
hopes
*NL*
that
the
reader
will
charitably
pass
over
his
shortcomings
in
this
*NL*
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Polynesian
words
used
in
this
volume
,
--
except
in
those
cases
*NL*
where
the
spelling
has
been
previously
determined
by
others
,
--
that
form
*NL*
of
orthography
has
been
employed
,
which
might
be
supposed
most
easily
*NL*
to
convey
their
sound
to
a
stranger
.
In
several
works
descriptive
of
the
*NL*
islands
in
the
Pacific
,
many
of
the
most
beautiful
combinations
of
*NL*
vocal
sounds
have
been
altogether
lost
to
the
ear
of
the
reader
by
an
*NL*
over-attention
to
the
ordinary
rules
of
spelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
a
few
passages
in
the
ensuing
chapters
which
may
be
thought
*NL*
to
bear
rather
hard
upon
a
reverend
order
of
men
,
the
account
of
whose
*NL*
proceedings
in
different
quarters
of
the
globe
--
transmitted
to
us
*NL*
through
their
own
hands
--
very
generally
,
and
often
very
deservedly
,
*NL*
receives
high
commendation
.
Such
passages
will
be
found
,
however
,
to
*NL*
be
based
upon
facts
admitting
of
no
contradiction
,
and
which
have
come
*NL*
immediately
under
the
writer
's
cognizance
.
The
conclusions
deduced
from
*NL*
these
facts
are
unavoidable
,
and
in
stating
them
the
author
has
been
*NL*
influenced
by
no
feeling
of
animosity
,
either
to
the
individuals
*NL*
themselves
,
or
to
that
glorious
cause
which
has
not
always
been
served
*NL*
by
the
proceedings
of
some
of
its
advocates
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
interest
with
which
the
important
events
lately
occurring
*NL*
at
the
Sandwich
,
Marquesas
,
and
Society
Islands
,
have
been
regarded
in
*NL*
America
and
England
,
and
indeed
throughout
the
world
,
will
,
he
trusts
,
*NL*
justify
a
few
otherwise
unwarrantable
digressions
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
some
things
related
in
the
narrative
which
will
be
sure
to
*NL*
appear
strange
,
or
perhaps
entirely
incomprehensible
,
to
the
reader
;
*NL*
but
they
can
not
appear
more
so
to
him
than
they
did
to
the
author
at
the
*NL*
time
.
He
has
stated
such
matters
just
as
they
occurred
,
and
leaves
every
*NL*
one
to
form
his
own
opinion
concerning
them
;
trusting
that
his
anxious
*NL*
desire
to
speak
the
unvarnished
truth
will
gain
for
him
the
confidence
*NL*
of
his
readers
.

INTRODUCTION
TO
THE
EDITION
OF
1892
*NL*
*NL*
By
Arthur
Stedman
*NL*
*NL*
OF
the
trinity
of
American
authors
whose
births
made
the
year
1819
a
*NL*
notable
one
in
our
literary
history
,
--
Lowell
,
Whitman
,
and
Melville
,
--
it
*NL*
is
interesting
to
observe
that
the
two
latter
were
both
descended
,
on
*NL*
the
fathers
'
and
mothers
'
sides
respectively
,
from
have
families
of
*NL*
British
New
England
and
Dutch
New
York
extraction
.
Whitman
and
Van
*NL*
Velsor
,
Melville
and
Gansevoort
,
were
the
several
combinations
which
*NL*
produced
these
men
;
and
it
is
easy
to
trace
in
the
life
and
character
*NL*
of
each
author
the
qualities
derived
from
his
joint
ancestry
.
Here
,
*NL*
however
,
the
resemblance
ceases
,
for
Whitman
's
forebears
,
while
worthy
*NL*
country
people
of
good
descent
,
were
not
prominent
in
public
or
private
*NL*
life
.
Melville
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
of
distinctly
patrician
birth
,
*NL*
his
paternal
and
maternal
grandfathers
having
been
leading
characters
in
*NL*
the
Revolutionary
War
;
their
descendants
still
maintaining
a
dignified
*NL*
social
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
Allan
Melville
,
great-grandfather
of
Herman
Melville
,
removed
from
*NL*
Scotland
to
America
in
1748
,
and
established
himself
as
a
merchant
*NL*
in
Boston
.
His
son
,
Major
Thomas
Melville
,
was
a
leader
in
the
famous
*NL*
`
Boston
Tea
Party
'
of
1773
and
afterwards
became
an
officer
in
the
*NL*
Continental
Army
.
He
is
reported
to
have
been
a
Conservative
in
all
*NL*
matters
except
his
opposition
to
unjust
taxation
,
and
he
wore
the
*NL*
old-fashioned
cocked
hat
and
knee-breeches
until
his
death
,
in
1832
,
*NL*
thus
becoming
the
original
of
Doctor
Holmes
's
poem
,
`
The
Last
Leaf
'
.
*NL*
Major
Melville
's
son
Allan
,
the
father
of
Herman
,
was
an
importing
*NL*
merchant
,
--
first
in
Boston
,
and
later
in
New
York
.
He
was
a
man
of
much
*NL*
culture
,
and
was
an
extensive
traveller
for
his
time
.
He
married
Maria
*NL*
Gansevoort
,
daughter
of
General
Peter
Gansevoort
,
best
known
as
`
the
*NL*
hero
of
Fort
Stanwix
.
'
This
fort
was
situated
on
the
present
site
of
*NL*
Rome
,
N.Y.
;
and
there
Gansevoort
,
with
a
small
body
of
men
,
held
in
*NL*
check
reinforcements
on
their
way
to
join
Burgoyne
,
until
the
disastrous
*NL*
ending
of
the
latter
's
campaign
of
1777
was
insured
.
The
Gansevoorts
,
it
*NL*
should
be
said
,
were
at
that
time
and
subsequently
residents
of
Albany
,
*NL*
N.Y.
*NL*
*NL*
Herman
Melville
was
born
in
New
York
on
August
1,1819
,
and
received
*NL*
his
early
education
in
that
city
.
There
he
imbibed
his
first
love
of
*NL*
adventure
,
listening
,
as
he
says
in
`
Redburn
,
'
while
his
father
`
of
*NL*
winter
evenings
,
by
the
well-remembered
sea-coal
fire
in
old
Greenwich
*NL*
Street
,
used
to
tell
my
brother
and
me
of
the
monstrous
waves
at
sea
,
*NL*
mountain
high
,
of
the
masts
bending
like
twigs
,
and
all
about
Havre
*NL*
and
Liverpool
.
'
The
death
of
his
father
in
reduced
circumstances
*NL*
necessitated
the
removal
of
his
mother
and
the
family
of
eight
brothers
*NL*
and
sisters
to
the
village
of
Lansingburg
,
on
the
Hudson
River
.
There
*NL*
Herman
remained
until
1835
,
when
he
attended
the
Albany
Classical
School
*NL*
for
some
months
.
Dr.
Charles
E.
West
,
the
well-known
Brooklyn
educator
,
*NL*
was
then
in
charge
of
the
school
,
and
remembers
the
lad
's
deftness
in
*NL*
English
composition
,
and
his
struggles
with
mathematics
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
year
was
passed
at
Pittsfield
,
Mass.
,
where
he
engaged
in
*NL*
work
on
his
uncle
's
farm
,
long
known
as
the
`
Van
Schaack
place
.
'
This
*NL*
uncle
was
Thomas
Melville
,
president
of
the
Berkshire
Agricultural
*NL*
Society
,
and
a
successful
gentleman
farmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Herman
's
roving
disposition
,
and
a
desire
to
support
himself
*NL*
independently
of
family
assistance
,
soon
led
him
to
ship
as
cabin
boy
*NL*
in
a
New
York
vessel
bound
for
Liverpool
.
He
made
the
voyage
,
visited
*NL*
London
,
and
returned
in
the
same
ship
.
`
Redburn
:
His
First
Voyage
,
'
*NL*
published
in
1849
,
is
partly
founded
on
the
experiences
of
this
trip
,
*NL*
which
was
undertaken
with
the
full
consent
of
his
relatives
,
and
which
*NL*
seems
to
have
satisfied
his
nautical
ambition
for
a
time
.
As
told
in
the
*NL*
book
,
Melville
met
with
more
than
the
usual
hardships
of
a
sailor-boy
's
*NL*
first
venture
.
It
does
not
seem
difficult
in
`
Redburn
'
to
separate
the
*NL*
author
's
actual
experiences
from
those
invented
by
him
,
this
being
the
*NL*
case
in
some
of
his
other
writings
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
good
part
of
the
succeeding
three
years
,
from
1837
to
1840
,
was
*NL*
occupied
with
school-teaching
.
While
so
engaged
at
Greenbush
,
now
*NL*
East
Albany
,
N.Y.
,
he
received
the
munificent
salary
of
`
six
dollars
*NL*
a
quarter
and
board
.
'
He
taught
for
one
term
at
Pittsfield
,
Mass.
,
*NL*
`
boarding
around
'
with
the
families
of
his
pupils
,
in
true
American
*NL*
fashion
,
and
easily
suppressing
,
on
one
memorable
occasion
,
the
efforts
*NL*
of
his
larger
scholars
to
inaugurate
a
rebellion
by
physical
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
fancy
that
it
was
the
reading
of
Richard
Henry
Dana
's
`
Two
Years
*NL*
Before
the
Mast
'
which
revived
the
spirit
of
adventure
in
Melville
's
*NL*
breast
.
That
book
was
published
in
1840
,
and
was
at
once
talked
of
*NL*
everywhere
.
Melville
must
have
read
it
at
the
time
,
mindful
of
his
*NL*
own
experience
as
a
sailor
.
At
any
rate
,
he
once
more
signed
a
ship
's
*NL*
articles
,
and
on
January
1
,
1841
,
sailed
from
New
Bedford
harbour
in
the
*NL*
whaler
Acushnet
,
bound
for
the
Pacific
Ocean
and
the
sperm
fishery
.
*NL*
He
has
left
very
little
direct
information
as
to
the
events
of
this
*NL*
eighteen
months
'
cruise
,
although
his
whaling
romance
,
`
Moby
Dick
;
or
,
*NL*
the
Whale
,
'
probably
gives
many
pictures
of
life
on
board
the
Acushnet
.
*NL*
In
the
present
volume
he
confines
himself
to
a
general
account
of
*NL*
the
captain
's
bad
treatment
of
the
crew
,
and
of
his
non-fulfilment
of
*NL*
agreements
.
Under
these
considerations
,
Melville
decided
to
abandon
the
*NL*
vessel
on
reaching
the
Marquesas
Islands
;
and
the
narrative
of
`
Typee
'
*NL*
begins
at
this
point
.
However
,
he
always
recognised
the
immense
*NL*
influence
the
voyage
had
had
upon
his
career
,
and
in
regard
to
its
*NL*
results
has
said
in
`
Moby
Dick
,
'
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
If
I
shall
ever
deserve
any
real
repute
in
that
small
but
high
hushed
*NL*
world
which
I
might
not
be
unreasonably
ambitious
of
;
if
hereafter
I
*NL*
shall
do
anything
that
on
the
whole
a
man
might
rather
have
done
than
to
*NL*
have
left
undone
...
then
here
I
prospectively
ascribe
all
the
honour
*NL*
and
the
glory
to
whaling
;
for
a
whale-ship
was
my
Yale
College
and
my
*NL*
Harvard
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
record
,
then
,
of
Melville
's
escape
from
the
Dolly
,
otherwise
the
*NL*
Acushnet
,
the
sojourn
of
his
companion
Toby
and
himself
in
the
Typee
*NL*
Valley
on
the
island
of
Nukuheva
,
Toby
's
mysterious
disappearance
,
and
*NL*
Melville
's
own
escape
,
is
fully
given
in
the
succeeding
pages
;
and
rash
*NL*
indeed
would
he
be
who
would
enter
into
a
descriptive
contest
with
these
*NL*
inimitable
pictures
of
aboriginal
life
in
the
`
Happy
Valley
.
'
So
great
*NL*
an
interest
has
always
centred
in
the
character
of
Toby
,
whose
actual
*NL*
existence
has
been
questioned
,
that
I
am
glad
to
be
able
to
declare
him
*NL*
an
authentic
personage
,
by
name
Richard
T.
Greene
.
He
was
enabled
to
*NL*
discover
himself
again
to
Mr.
Melville
through
the
publication
of
the
*NL*
present
volume
,
and
their
acquaintance
was
renewed
,
lasting
for
quite
*NL*
a
long
period
.
I
have
seen
his
portrait
,
--
a
rare
old
daguerrotype
,
--
and
*NL*
some
of
his
letters
to
our
author
.
One
of
his
children
was
named
for
the
*NL*
latter
,
but
Mr.
Melville
lost
trace
of
him
in
recent
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
author
's
rescue
from
what
Dr.
T.
M.
Coan
has
styled
his
*NL*
`
anxious
paradise
,
'
`
Typee
'
ends
,
and
its
sequel
,
`
Omoo
,
'
begins
.
Here
,
*NL*
again
,
it
seems
wisest
to
leave
the
remaining
adventures
in
the
South
*NL*
Seas
to
the
reader
's
own
discovery
,
simply
stating
that
,
after
a
sojourn
*NL*
at
the
Society
Islands
,
Melville
shipped
for
Honolulu
.
There
he
remained
*NL*
for
four
months
,
employed
as
a
clerk
.
He
joined
the
crew
of
the
American
*NL*
frigate
United
States
,
which
reached
Boston
,
stopping
on
the
way
at
one
*NL*
of
the
Peruvian
ports
,
in
October
of
1844
.
Once
more
was
a
narrative
*NL*
of
his
experiences
to
be
preserved
in
`
White
Jacket
;
or
,
the
World
in
*NL*
a
Man-of-War
.
'
Thus
,
of
Melville
's
four
most
important
books
,
three
,
*NL*
`
Typee
,
'
`
Omoo
,
'
and
`
White-Jacket
,
'
are
directly
auto
biographical
,
*NL*
and
`
Moby
Dick
'
is
partially
so
;
while
the
less
important
`
Redburn
'
is
*NL*
between
the
two
classes
in
this
respect
.
Melville
's
other
prose
works
,
*NL*
as
will
be
shown
,
were
,
with
some
exceptions
,
unsuccessful
efforts
at
*NL*
creative
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
our
author
entered
on
his
whaling
adventures
in
the
South
Seas
*NL*
with
a
determination
to
make
them
available
for
literary
purposes
,
may
*NL*
never
be
certainly
known
.
There
was
no
such
elaborate
announcement
or
*NL*
advance
preparation
as
in
some
later
cases
.
I
am
inclined
to
believe
*NL*
that
the
literary
prospect
was
an
after-thought
,
and
that
this
insured
*NL*
a
freshness
and
enthusiasm
of
style
not
otherwise
to
be
attained
.
*NL*
Returning
to
his
mother
's
home
at
Lansingburg
,
Melville
soon
began
the
*NL*
writing
of
`
Typee
,
'
which
was
completed
by
the
autumn
of
1845
.
Shortly
*NL*
after
this
his
older
brother
,
Gansevoort
Melville
,
sailed
for
England
*NL*
as
secretary
of
legation
to
Ambassador
McLane
,
and
the
manuscript
was
*NL*
intrusted
to
Gansevoort
for
submission
to
John
Murray
.
Its
immediate
*NL*
acceptance
and
publication
followed
in
1846
.
`
Typee
'
was
dedicated
to
*NL*
Chief
Justice
Lemuel
Shaw
of
Massachusetts
,
an
old
friendship
between
*NL*
the
author
's
family
and
that
of
Justice
Shaw
having
been
renewed
about
*NL*
this
time
.
Mr.
Melville
became
engaged
to
Miss
Elizabeth
Shaw
,
the
only
*NL*
daughter
of
the
Chief
Justice
,
and
their
marriage
followed
on
August
4
,
*NL*
1847
,
in
Boston
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wanderings
of
our
nautical
Othello
were
thus
brought
to
a
*NL*
conclusion
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Melville
resided
in
New
York
City
until
1850
,
*NL*
when
they
purchased
a
farmhouse
at
Pittsfield
,
their
farm
adjoining
that
*NL*
formerly
owned
by
Mr.
Melville
's
uncle
,
which
had
been
inherited
by
the
*NL*
latter
's
son
.
The
new
place
was
named
`
Arrow
Head
,
'
from
the
numerous
*NL*
Indian
antiquities
found
in
the
neighbourhood
.
The
house
was
so
situated
*NL*
as
to
command
an
uninterrupted
view
of
Greylock
Mountain
and
the
*NL*
adjacent
hills
.
Here
Melville
remained
for
thirteen
years
,
occupied
*NL*
with
his
writing
,
and
managing
his
farm
.

Hawthorne

set
forth
.
The
*NL*
letter
is
dated
June
1
,
1851
.

*NL*
`
Since
you
have
been
here
I
have
been
building
some
shanties
of
houses
*NL*

connected
with
the
old
one
-RRB-
,
and
likewise
some
shanties
of
chapters
and
*NL*
essays
.
I
have
been
ploughing
and
sowing
and
raising
and
printing
and
*NL*
praying
,
and
now
begin
to
come
out
upon
a

and
to

enjoy
the
calm
prospect
of
things
from
a
fair
piazza
at
the
north
of
the
*NL*
old
farmhouse
here

Not

am
I
without
something

be
urgent
with

wearied

and
disgusted
with
the
heat
*NL*
and
dust
of
the
Babylonish
brick-kiln
of
New
York
,
I
came
back
to
the
*NL*
country
to
feel
the
grass
,
and
end
the
book
reclining
on
it
,
if
I
may

*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Hawthorne
,
who
was
then
living
in
the
red
cottage
at
Lenox
,
had
*NL*
a
week
at
Arrow
Head
with
his
daughter
Una
the
previous
spring
.
It
is
*NL*
recorded
that
the
friends
`
spent
most
of
the
time
in
the
barn
,
bathing
*NL*
in
the
early
spring
sunshine
,
which
streamed
through
the
open
doors
,
*NL*
and
talking
philosophy
.
'
According
to
Mr.
J.
E.
A.
Smith
's
volume
on
the
*NL*
Berkshire
Hills
,
these
gentlemen
,
both
reserved
in
nature
,
though
near
*NL*
neighbours
and
often
in
the
same
company
,
were
inclined
to
be
shy
of
*NL*
each
other
,
partly
,
perhaps
,
through
the
knowledge
that
Melville
had
*NL*
written
a
very
appreciative
review
of
`
Mosses
from
an
Old
Manse
'
for
the
*NL*
New
York
Literary
World
,
edited
by
their
mutual
friends
,
the
Duyckincks
.
*NL*
`
But
one
day
,
'
writes
Mr.
Smith
,
`
it
chanced
that
when
they
were
out
on
*NL*
a
picnic
excursion
,
the
two
were
compelled
by
a
thundershower
to
take
*NL*
shelter
in
a
narrow
recess
of
the
rocks
of
Monument
Mountain
.
Two
hours
*NL*
of
this
enforced
intercourse
settled
the
matter
.
They
learned
so
much
*NL*
of
each
other
's
character
,
...
that
the
most
intimate
friendship
for
*NL*
the
future
was
inevitable
.
'
A
passage
in
Hawthorne
's
`
Wonder
Book
'
*NL*
is
noteworthy
as
describing
the
number
of
literary
neighbours
in
*NL*
Berkshire
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
For
my
part
,
I
wish
I
had
Pegasus
here
at
this
moment
,
'
said
the
*NL*
student
.
'
I
would
mount
him
forthwith
,
and
gallop
about
the
country
*NL*
within
a
circumference
of
a
few
miles
,
making
literary
calls
on
my
*NL*
brother
authors
.
Dr.
Dewey
would
be
within
ray
reach
,
at
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
Taconic
.
In
Stockbridge
,
yonder
,
is
Mr.
James
-LSB-
G.
P.
R.
James
-RSB-
,
*NL*
conspicuous
to
all
the
world
on
his
mountain-pile
of
history
and
*NL*
romance
.
Longfellow
,
I
believe
,
is
not
yet
at
the
Oxbow
,
else
the
winged
*NL*
horse
would
neigh
at
him
.
But
here
in
Lenox
I
should
find
our
most
*NL*
truthful
novelist
-LSB-
Miss
Sedgwick
-RSB-
,
who
has
made
the
scenery
and
life
*NL*
of
Berkshire
all
her
own
.
On
the
hither
side
of
Pittsfield
sits
Herman
*NL*
Melville
,
shaping
out
the
gigantic
conception
of
his
`
White
Whale
,
'
*NL*
while
the
gigantic
shadow
of
Greylock
looms
upon
him
from
his
study
*NL*
window
.
Another
bound
of
my
flying
steed
would
bring
me
to
the
door
of
*NL*
Holmes
,
whom
I
mention
last
,
because
Pegasus
would
certainly
unseat
me
*NL*
the
next
minute
,
and
claim
the
poet
as
his
rider
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
While
at
Pittsfield
,
Mr.
Melville
was
induced
to
enter
the
lecture
*NL*
field
.
From
1857
to
1860
he
filled
many
engagements
in
the
lyceums
,
*NL*
chiefly
speaking
of
his
adventures
in
the
South
Seas
.
He
lectured
*NL*
in
cities
as
widely
apart
as
Montreal
,
Chicago
,
Baltimore
,
and
San
*NL*
Francisco
,
sailing
to
the
last-named
place
in
1860
,
by
way
of
Cape
*NL*
Horn
,
on
the
Meteor
,
commanded
,
by
his
younger
brother
,
Captain
Thomas
*NL*
Melville
,
afterward
governor
of
the
`
Sailor
's
Snug
Harbor
'
at
Staten
*NL*
Island
,
N.Y.
Besides
his
voyage
to
San
Francisco
,
he
had
,
in
1849
and
*NL*
1856
,
visited
England
,
the
Continent
,
and
the
Holy
Land
,
partly
to
*NL*
superintend
the
publication
of
English
editions
of
his
works
,
and
partly
*NL*
for
recreation
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
pronounced
feature
of
Melville
's
character
was
his
unwillingness
to
*NL*
speak
of
himself
,
his
adventures
,
or
his
writings
in
conversation
.
He
*NL*
was
,
however
,
able
to
overcome
this
reluctance
on
the
lecture
platform
.
*NL*
Our
author
's
tendency
to
philosophical
discussion
is
strikingly
set
*NL*
forth
in
a
letter
from
Dr.
Titus
Munson
Coan
to
the
latter
's
mother
,
*NL*
written
while
a
student
at
Williams
College
over
thirty
years
ago
,
*NL*
and
fortunately
preserved
by
her
.
Dr.
Coan
enjoyed
the
friendship
and
*NL*
confidence
of
Mr.
Melville
during
most
of
his
residence
in
New
York
.
The
*NL*
letter
reads
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
made
my
first
literary
pilgrimage
,
a
call
upon
Herman
Melville
,
*NL*
the
renowned
author
of
`
Typee
,
'
etc.
.
He
lives
in
a
spacious
farmhouse
*NL*
about
two
miles
from
Pittsfield
,
a
weary
walk
through
the
dust
.
But
it
*NL*
as
well
repaid
.
I
introduced
myself
as
a
Hawaiian-American
,
and
soon
*NL*
found
myself
in
full
tide
of
talk
,
or
rather
of
monologue
.
But
he
would
*NL*
not
repeat
the
experiences
of
which
I
had
been
reading
with
rapture
in
*NL*
his
books
.
In
vain
I
sought
to
hear
of
Typee
and
those
paradise
islands
,
*NL*
but
he
preferred
to
pour
forth
his
philosophy
and
his
theories
of
*NL*
life
.
The
shade
of
Aristotle
arose
like
a
cold
mist
between
myself
and
*NL*
Fayaway
.
We
have
quite
enough
of
deep
philosophy
at
Williams
College
,
*NL*
and
I
confess
I
was
disappointed
in
this
trend
of
the
talk
.
But
what
*NL*
a
talk
it
was
!
Melville
is
transformed
from
a
Marquesan
to
a
gypsy
*NL*
student
,
the
gypsy
element
still
remaining
strong
within
him
.
And
this
*NL*
contradiction
gives
him
the
air
of
one
who
has
suffered
from
opposition
,
*NL*
both
literary
and
social
.
With
his
liberal
views
,
he
is
apparently
*NL*
considered
by
the
good
people
of
Pittsfield
as
little
better
than
a
*NL*
cannibal
or
a
`
beach-comber
.
'
His
attitude
seemed
to
me
something
like
*NL*
that
of
Ishmael
;
but
perhaps
I
judged
hastily
.
I
managed
to
draw
him
out
*NL*
very
freely
on
everything
but
the
Marquesas
Islands
,
and
when
I
left
him
*NL*
he
was
in
full
tide
of
discourse
on
all
things
sacred
and
profane
.
But
*NL*
he
seems
to
put
away
the
objective
side
of
his
life
,
and
to
shut
himself
*NL*
up
in
this
cold
north
as
a
cloistered
thinker
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
been
told
by
Dr.
Coan
that
his
father
,
the
Rev.
Titus
Coan
,
of
*NL*
the
Hawaiian
Islands
,
personally
visited
the
Marquesas
group
,
found
*NL*
the
Typee
Valley
,
and
verified
in
all
respects
the
statements
made
*NL*
in
`
Typee
.
'
It
is
known
that
Mr.
Melville
from
early
manhood
indulged
*NL*
deeply
in
philosophical
studies
,
and
his
fondness
for
discussing
such
*NL*
matters
is
pointed
out
by
Hawthorne
also
,
in
the
`
English
Note
Books
.
'
*NL*
This
habit
increased
as
he
advanced
in
years
,
if
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
event
of
the
residence
in
Pittsfield
was
the
completion
and
*NL*
publication
of
`
Moby
Dick
;
or
,
the
Whale
,
'
in
1851
.
How
many
young
men
*NL*
have
been
drawn
to
sea
by
this
book
is
a
question
of
interest
.
Meeting
*NL*
with
Mr.
Charles
Henry
Webb
-LRB-
`
John
Paul
'
-RRB-
the
day
after
Mr.
Melville
's
*NL*
death
,
I
asked
him
if
he
were
not
familiar
with
that
author
's
writings
.
*NL*
He
replied
that
`
Moby
Dick
'
was
responsible
for
his
three
years
of
life
*NL*
before
the
mast
when
a
lad
,
and
added
that
while
`
gamming
'
on
board
*NL*
another
vessel
he
had
once
fallen
in
with
a
member
of
the
boat
's
crew
*NL*
which
rescued
Melville
from
his
friendly
imprisonment
among
the
Typees
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
at
Pittsfield
,
besides
his
own
family
,
Mr.
Melville
's
mother
*NL*
and
sisters
resided
with
him
.
As
his
four
children
grew
up
he
found
*NL*
it
necessary
to
obtain
for
them
better
facilities
for
study
than
the
*NL*
village
school
afforded
;
and
so
,
several
years
after
,
the
household
was
*NL*
broken
up
,
and
he
removed
with
his
wife
and
children
to
the
New
York
*NL*
house
that
was
afterwards
his
home
.
This
house
belonged
to
his
brother
*NL*
Allan
,
and
was
exchanged
for
the
estate
at
Pittsfield
.
In
December
,
*NL*
1866
,
he
was
appointed
by
Mr.
H.
A.
Smyth
,
a
former
travelling
companion
*NL*
in
Europe
,
a
district
officer
in
the
New
York
Custom
House
.
He
held
the
*NL*
position
until
1886
,
preferring
it
to
in-door
clerical
work
,
and
then
*NL*
resigned
,
the
duties
becoming
too
arduous
for
his
failing
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
his
philosophical
studies
,
Mr.
Melville
was
much
*NL*
interested
in
all
matters
relating
to
the
fine
arts
,
and
devoted
most
of
*NL*
his
leisure
hours
to
the
two
subjects
.
A
notable
collection
of
etchings
*NL*
and
engravings
from
the
old
masters
was
gradually
made
by
him
,
those
*NL*
from
Claude
's
paintings
being
a
specialty
.
After
he
retired
from
the
*NL*
Custom
House
,
his
tall
,
stalwart
figure
could
be
seen
almost
daily
*NL*
tramping
through
the
Fort
George
district
or
Central
Park
,
his
roving
*NL*
inclination
leading
him
to
obtain
as
much
out-door
life
as
possible
.
*NL*
His
evenings
were
spent
at
home
with
his
books
,
his
pictures
,
and
his
*NL*
family
,
and
usually
with
them
alone
;
for
,
in
spite
of
the
melodramatic
*NL*
declarations
of
various
English
gentlemen
,
Melville
's
seclusion
in
his
*NL*
latter
years
,
and
in
fact
throughout
his
life
,
was
a
matter
of
personal
*NL*
choice
.
More
and
more
,
as
he
grew
older
,
he
avoided
every
action
on
his
*NL*
part
,
and
on
the
part
of
his
family
,
that
might
tend
to
keep
his
name
*NL*
and
writings
before
the
public
.
A
few
friends
felt
at
liberty
to
visit
*NL*
the
recluse
,
and
were
kindly
welcomed
,
but
he
himself
sought
no
one
.
His
*NL*
favorite
companions
were
his
grandchildren
,
with
whom
he
delighted
to
*NL*
pass
his
time
,
and
his
devoted
wife
,
who
was
a
constant
assistant
and
*NL*
adviser
in
his
literary
work
,
chiefly
done
at
this
period
for
his
*NL*
own
amusement
.
To
her
he
addressed
his
last
little
poem
,
the
touching
*NL*
`
Return
of
the
Sire
de
Nesle
.
'
Various
efforts
were
made
by
the
New
York
*NL*
literary
colony
to
draw
him
from
his
retirement
,
but
without
success
.
*NL*
It
has
been
suggested
that
he
might
have
accepted
a
magazine
editorship
,
*NL*
but
this
is
doubtful
,
as
he
could
not
bear
business
details
or
routine
*NL*
work
of
any
sort
.
His
brother
Allan
was
a
New
York
lawyer
,
and
until
his
*NL*
death
,
in
1872
,
managed
Melville
's
affairs
with
ability
,
particularly
*NL*
the
literary
accounts
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
these
later
years
he
took
great
pleasure
in
a
friendly
*NL*
correspondence
with
Mr.
W.
Clark
Russell
.
Mr.
Russell
had
taken
many
*NL*
occasions
to
mention
Melville
's
sea-tales
,
his
interest
in
them
,
and
his
*NL*
indebtedness
to
them
.
The
latter
felt
impelled
to
write
Mr.
Russell
in
*NL*
regard
to
one
of
his
newly
published
novels
,
and
received
in
answer
the
*NL*
following
letter
:
*NL*
*NL*
July
21
,
1886
.
*NL*
*NL*
MY
DEAR
Mr.
MELVILLE
,
Your
letter
has
given
me
a
very
great
and
singular
*NL*
pleasure
.
Your
delightful
books
carry
the
imagination
into
a
maritime
*NL*
period
so
remote
that
,
often
as
you
have
been
in
my
mind
,
I
could
*NL*
never
satisfy
myself
that
you
were
still
amongst
the
living
.
I
am
glad
,
*NL*
indeed
,
to
learn
from
Mr.
Toft
that
you
are
still
hale
and
hearty
,
and
I
*NL*
do
most
heartily
wish
you
many
years
yet
of
health
and
vigour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
books
I
have
in
the
American
edition
.
I
have
`
Typee
,
`
Omoo
,
'
*NL*
`
Redburn
,
'
and
that
noble
piece
`
Moby
Dick
.
'
These
are
all
I
have
been
*NL*
able
to
obtain
.
There
have
been
many
editions
of
your
works
in
this
*NL*
country
,
particularly
the
lovely
South
Sea
sketches
;
but
the
editions
*NL*
are
not
equal
to
those
of
the
American
publishers
.
Your
reputation
here
*NL*
is
very
great
.
It
is
hard
to
meet
a
man
whose
opinion
as
a
reader
is
*NL*
worth
leaving
who
does
not
speak
of
your
works
in
such
terms
as
he
*NL*
might
hesitate
to
employ
,
with
all
his
patriotism
,
toward
many
renowned
*NL*
English
writers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dana
is
,
indeed
,
great
.
There
is
nothing
in
literature
more
remarkable
*NL*
than
the
impression
produced
by
Dana
's
portraiture
of
the
homely
inner
*NL*
life
of
a
little
brig
's
forecastle
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
beg
that
you
will
accept
my
thanks
for
the
kindly
spirit
in
which
you
*NL*
have
read
my
books
.
I
wish
it
were
in
my
power
to
cross
the
Atlantic
,
*NL*
for
you
assuredly
would
be
the
first
whom
it
would
be
my
happiness
to
*NL*
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
condition
of
my
right
hand
obliges
me
to
dictate
this
to
my
son
;
*NL*
but
painful
as
it
is
to
me
to
hold
a
pen
,
I
can
not
suffer
this
letter
*NL*
to
reach
the
hands
of
a
man
of
so
admirable
genitis
as
Herman
Melville
*NL*
without
begging
him
to
believe
me
to
be
,
with
my
own
hand
,
his
most
*NL*
respectful
and
hearty
admirer
,
W.
Clark
Russell
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
should
be
noted
here
that
Melville
's
increased
reputation
in
England
*NL*
at
the
period
of
this
letter
was
chiefly
owing
to
a
series
of
articles
*NL*
on
his
work
written
by
Mr.
Russell
.
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
few
English
*NL*
papers
made
more
than
a
passing
reference
to
Melville
's
death
.
The
*NL*
American
press
discussed
his
life
and
work
in
numerous
and
lengthy
*NL*
reviews
.
At
the
same
time
,
there
always
has
been
a
steady
sale
of
his
*NL*
books
in
England
,
and
some
of
them
never
have
been
out
of
print
in
that
*NL*
country
since
the
publication
of
`
Typee
.
'
One
result
of
this
friendship
*NL*
between
the
two
authors
was
the
dedication
of
new
volumes
to
each
other
*NL*
in
highly
complimentary
terms
--
Mr.
Melville
's
`
John
Marr
and
Other
*NL*
Sailors
,
'
of
which
twenty-five
copies
only
were
printed
,
on
the
one
*NL*
hand
,
and
Mr.
Russell
's
`
An
Ocean
Tragedy
,
'
on
the
other
,
of
which
many
*NL*
thousand
have
been
printed
,
not
to
mention
unnumbered
pirated
copies
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
Hawthorne
,
Mr.
Richard
Henry
Stoddard
,
of
American
writers
,
*NL*
specially
knew
and
appreciated
Herman
Melville
.
Mr.
Stoddard
was
*NL*
connected
with
the
New
York
dock
department
at
the
time
of
Mr.
*NL*
Melville
's
appointment
to
a
custom-house
position
,
and
they
at
once
*NL*
became
acquainted
.
For
a
good
many
years
,
during
the
period
in
which
*NL*
our
author
remained
in
seclusion
,
much
that
appeared
in
print
in
America
*NL*
concerning
Melville
came
from
the
pen
of
Mr.
Stoddard
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
the
sailor
author
's
presence
in
New
York
was
well
known
to
the
literary
*NL*
guild
.
He
was
invited
to
join
in
all
new
movements
,
but
as
often
felt
*NL*
obliged
to
excuse
himself
from
doing
so
.
The
present
writer
lived
for
*NL*
some
time
within
a
short
distance
of
his
house
,
but
found
no
opportunity
*NL*
to
meet
him
until
it
became
necessary
to
obtain
his
portrait
for
an
*NL*
anthology
in
course
of
publication
.
The
interview
was
brief
,
and
the
*NL*
interviewer
could
not
help
feeling
although
treated
with
pleasant
*NL*
courtesy
,
that
more
important
matters
were
in
hand
than
the
perpetuation
*NL*
of
a
romancer
's
countenance
to
future
generations
;
but
a
friendly
family
*NL*
acquaintance
grew
up
from
the
incident
,
and
will
remain
an
abiding
*NL*
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Melville
died
at
his
home
in
New
York
City
early
on
the
morning
of
*NL*
September
28
,
1891
.
His
serious
illness
had
lasted
a
number
of
*NL*
months
,
so
that
the
end
came
as
a
release
.
True
to
his
ruling
passion
,
*NL*
philosophy
had
claimed
him
to
the
last
,
a
set
of
Schopenhauer
's
works
*NL*
receiving
his
attention
when
able
to
study
;
but
this
was
varied
with
*NL*
readings
in
the
`
Mermaid
Series
'
of
old
plays
,
in
which
he
took
much
*NL*
pleasure
.
His
library
,
in
addition
to
numerous
works
on
philosophy
and
*NL*
the
fine
arts
,
was
composed
of
standard
books
of
all
classes
,
including
,
*NL*
of
course
,
a
proportion
of
nautical
literature
.
Especially
interesting
*NL*
are
fifteen
or
twenty
first
editions
of
Hawthorne
's
books
inscribed
to
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Melville
by
the
author
and
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
immediate
acceptance
of
`
Typee
'
by
John
Murray
was
followed
by
an
*NL*
arrangement
with
the
London
agent
of
an
American
publisher
,
for
its
*NL*
simultaneous
publication
in
the
United
States
.
I
understand
that
Murray
*NL*
did
not
then
publish
fiction
.
At
any
rate
,
the
book
was
accepted
by
him
*NL*
on
the
assurance
of
Gansevoort
Melville
that
it
contained
nothing
not
*NL*
actually
experienced
by
his
brother
.
Murray
brought
it
out
early
in
*NL*
1846
,
in
his
Colonial
and
Home
Library
,
as
'
A
Narrative
of
a
Four
*NL*
Months
'
Residence
among
the
Natives
of
a
Valley
of
the
Marquesas
*NL*
Islands
;
or
,
a
Peep
at
Polynesian
Life
,
'
or
,
more
briefly
,
`
Melville
's
*NL*
Marquesas
Islands
.
'
It
was
issued
in
America
with
the
author
's
own
*NL*
title
,
`
Typee
,
'
and
in
the
outward
shape
of
a
work
of
fiction
.
Mr.
*NL*
Melville
found
himself
famous
at
once
.
Many
discussions
were
carried
on
*NL*
as
to
the
genuineness
of
the
author
's
name
and
the
reality
of
the
events
*NL*
portrayed
,
but
English
and
American
critics
alike
recognised
the
book
's
*NL*
importance
as
a
contribution
to
literature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Melville
,
in
a
letter
to
Hawthorne
,
speaks
of
himself
as
having
no
*NL*
development
at
all
until
his
twenty-fifth
year
,
the
time
of
his
return
*NL*
from
the
Pacific
;
but
surely
the
process
of
development
must
have
been
*NL*
well
advanced
to
permit
of
so
virile
and
artistic
a
creation
as
`
Typee
.
'
*NL*
While
the
narrative
does
not
always
run
smoothly
,
yet
the
style
for
the
*NL*
most
part
is
graceful
and
alluring
,
so
that
we
pass
from
one
scene
of
*NL*
Pacific
enchantment
to
another
quite
oblivious
of
the
vast
amount
of
*NL*
descriptive
detail
which
is
being
poured
out
upon
us
.
It
is
the
varying
*NL*
fortune
of
the
hero
which
engrosses
our
attention
.
We
follow
his
*NL*
adventures
with
breathless
interest
,
or
luxuriate
with
him
in
the
leafy
*NL*
bowers
of
the
`
Happy
Valley
,
'
surrounded
by
joyous
children
of
nature
.
*NL*
When
all
is
ended
,
we
then
for
the
first
time
realise
that
we
know
these
*NL*
people
and
their
ways
as
if
we
too
had
dwelt
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
believe
that
`
Typee
'
will
ever
lose
its
position
as
a
classic
*NL*
of
American
Literature
.
The
pioneer
in
South
Sea
romance
--
for
*NL*
the
mechanical
descriptions
of
earlier
voyagers
are
not
worthy
of
*NL*
comparison
--
this
book
has
as
yet
met
with
no
superior
,
even
in
French
*NL*
literature
;
nor
has
it
met
with
a
rival
in
any
other
language
than
the
*NL*
French
.
The
character
of
`
Fayaway
,
'
and
,
no
less
,
William
S.
Mayo
's
*NL*
`
Kaloolah
,
'
the
enchanting
dreams
of
many
a
youthful
heart
,
will
retain
*NL*
their
charm
;
and
this
in
spite
of
endless
variations
by
modern
explorers
*NL*
in
the
same
domain
.
A
faint
type
of
both
characters
may
be
found
in
the
*NL*
Surinam
Yarico
of
Captain
John
Gabriel
Stedman
,
whose
`
Narrative
of
a
*NL*
Five
Years
'
Expedition
'
appeared
in
1796
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Typee
,
'
as
written
,
contained
passages
reflecting
with
considerable
*NL*
severity
on
the
methods
pursued
by
missionaries
in
the
South
Seas
.
The
*NL*
manuscript
was
printed
in
a
complete
form
in
England
,
and
created
much
*NL*
discussion
on
this
account
,
Melville
being
accused
of
bitterness
;
but
he
*NL*
asserted
his
lack
of
prejudice
.
The
passages
referred
to
were
omitted
in
*NL*
the
first
and
all
subsequent
American
editions
.
They
have
been
restored
*NL*
in
the
present
issue
,
which
is
complete
save
for
a
few
paragraphs
*NL*
excluded
by
written
direction
of
the
author
.
I
have
,
with
the
consent
*NL*
of
his
family
,
changed
the
long
and
cumbersome
sub-title
of
the
book
,
*NL*
calling
it
a
`
Real-Romance
of
the
South
Seas
,
'
as
best
expressing
its
*NL*
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
success
of
his
first
volume
encouraged
Melville
to
proceed
in
his
*NL*
work
,
and
`
Omoo
,
'
the
sequel
to
`
Typee
,
'
appeared
in
England
and
America
*NL*
in
1847
.
Here
we
leave
,
for
the
most
part
,
the
dreamy
pictures
of
island
*NL*
life
,
and
find
ourselves
sharing
the
extremely
realistic
discomforts
of
*NL*
a
Sydney
whaler
in
the
early
forties
.
The
rebellious
crew
's
experiences
*NL*
in
the
Society
Islands
are
quite
as
realistic
as
events
on
board
ship
*NL*
and
very
entertaining
,
while
the
whimsical
character
,
Dr.
Long
Ghost
,
*NL*
next
to
Captain
Ahab
in
`
Moby
Dick
,
'
is
Melville
's
most
striking
*NL*
delineation
.
The
errors
of
the
South
Sea
missions
are
pointed
out
with
*NL*
even
more
force
than
in
`
Typee
,
'
and
it
is
a
fact
that
both
these
books
*NL*
have
ever
since
been
of
the
greatest
value
to
outgoing
missionaries
on
*NL*
account
of
the
exact
information
contained
in
them
with
respect
to
the
*NL*
islanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Melville
's
power
in
describing
and
investing
with
romance
scenes
and
*NL*
incidents
witnessed
and
participated
in
by
himself
,
and
his
frequent
*NL*
failure
of
success
as
an
inventor
of
characters
and
situations
,
were
*NL*
early
pointed
out
by
his
critics
.
More
recently
Mr.
Henry
S.
Salt
*NL*
has
drawn
the
same
distinction
very
carefully
in
an
excellent
article
*NL*
contributed
to
the
Scottish
Art
Review
.
In
a
prefatory
note
to
`
Mardi
'
*NL*
-LRB-
1849
-RRB-
,
Melville
declares
that
,
as
his
former
books
have
been
received
*NL*
as
romance
instead
of
reality
,
he
will
now
try
his
hand
at
pure
fiction
.
*NL*
`
Mardi
'
may
be
called
a
splendid
failure
.
It
must
have
been
soon
after
*NL*
the
completion
of
`
Omoo
'
that
Melville
began
to
study
the
writings
of
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
Browne
.
Heretofore
our
author
's
style
was
rough
in
places
,
*NL*
but
marvellously
simple
and
direct
.
`
Mardi
'
is
burdened
with
an
*NL*
over-rich
diction
,
which
Melville
never
entirely
outgrew
.
The
scene
*NL*
of
this
romance
,
which
opens
well
,
is
laid
in
the
South
Seas
,
but
*NL*
everything
soon
becomes
overdrawn
and
fantastical
,
and
the
thread
of
the
*NL*
story
loses
itself
in
a
mystical
allegory
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Redburn
,
'
already
mentioned
,
succeeded
`
Mardi
'
in
the
same
year
,
and
*NL*
was
a
partial
return
to
the
author
's
earlier
style
.
In
`
White-Jacket
;
*NL*
or
,
the
World
in
a
Man-of-War
'
-LRB-
1850
-RRB-
,
Melville
almost
regained
it
.
This
*NL*
book
has
no
equal
as
a
picture
of
life
aboard
a
sailing
man-of-war
,
the
*NL*
lights
and
shadows
of
naval
existence
being
well
contrasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
`
Moby
Dick
;
or
,
the
Whale
'
-LRB-
1851
-RRB-
,
Melville
reached
the
topmost
*NL*
notch
of
his
fame
.
The
book
represents
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
the
*NL*
conflict
between
the
author
's
earlier
and
later
methods
of
composition
,
*NL*
but
the
gigantic
conception
of
the
`
White
Whale
,
'
as
Hawthorne
expressed
*NL*
it
,
permeates
the
whole
work
,
and
lifts
it
bodily
into
the
highest
*NL*
domain
of
romance
.
`
Moby
Dick
'
contains
an
immense
amount
of
information
*NL*
concerning
the
habits
of
the
whale
and
the
methods
of
its
capture
,
but
*NL*
this
is
characteristically
introduced
in
a
way
not
to
interfere
with
*NL*
the
narrative
.
The
chapter
entitled
`
Stubb
Kills
a
Whale
'
ranks
with
the
*NL*
choicest
examples
of
descriptive
literature
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Moby
Dick
'
appeared
,
and
Melville
enjoyed
to
the
full
the
enhanced
*NL*
reputation
it
brought
him
.
He
did
not
,
however
,
take
warning
from
*NL*
`
Mardi
,
'
but
allowed
himself
to
plunge
more
deeply
into
the
sea
of
*NL*
philosophy
and
fantasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pierre
;
or
,
the
Ambiguities
'
-LRB-
1852
-RRB-
was
published
,
and
there
ensued
*NL*
a
long
series
of
hostile
criticisms
,
ending
with
a
severe
,
though
*NL*
impartial
,
article
by
Fitz-James
O'Brien
in
Putnam
's
Monthly
.
About
the
*NL*
same
time
the
whole
stock
of
the
author
's
books
was

and
public

*NL*
which
until
then
had
been
on
the
increase

began

.

*NL*
After
this
Mr.
Melville
contributed
several
short
stories
to
Putnam
's
*NL*
Monthly
and
Harper
's
Magazine
.
Those
in
the
former
periodical
were
*NL*
collected
in
a
volume
as
Piazza
Tales
-LRB-
1856
-RRB-
;
and
of
these
`
Benito
*NL*
Cereno
'
and
`
The
Bell
Tower
'
are
equal
to
his
best
previous
efforts

'
-LRB-
1855
-RRB-
,
first
printed
as
a
*NL*
serial
in
Putnam
's
,
is
an
historical
romance
of
the
American
Revolution
,
*NL*
based
on
the
hero
's
own
account
of
his
adventures
,
as
given
in
a
little
*NL*
volume
picked
up
by
Mr.
Melville
at
a
book-stall
.
The
story
is
well
*NL*
told
,
but
the
book
is
hardly
worthy
of
the
author
of
`
Typee
.

The

*NL*
not

*NL*
Mr.
Melville
's
pen
had
rested
for
nearly
ten
years
,
when
it
was
again
*NL*
taken
up
to
celebrate
the
events
of
the
Civil
War
.
`
Battle
Pieces
and
*NL*
Aspects
of
the
War
'
appeared
in
1866
.
Most
of
these
poems
originated
,
*NL*
according
to
the
author
,
in
an
impulse
imparted
by
the
fall
of
Richmond
;
*NL*
but
they
have
as
subjects
all
the
chief
incidents
of
the
struggle
.
The
*NL*
best
of
them
are
`
The
Stone
Fleet
,
'
`
In
the
Prison
Pen
,
'
`
The
College
*NL*
Colonel
,
'
`
The
March
to
the
Sea
,
'
`
Running
the
Batteries
,
'
and
`
Sheridan
*NL*
at
Cedar
Creek
.
'
Some
of
these
had
a
wide
circulation
in
the
press
,
and
*NL*
were
preserved
in
various
anthologies
.
`
Clarel
,
a
Poem
and
Pilgrimage
*NL*
in
the
Holy
Land
'
-LRB-
1876
-RRB-
,
is
a
long
mystical
poem
requiring
,
as
some
one
*NL*
has
said
,
a
dictionary
,
a
cyclopaedia
,
and
a
copy
of
the
Bible
for
its
*NL*
elucidation
.
In
the
two
privately
printed
volumes
,
the
arrangement
of
*NL*
which
occupied
Mr.
Melville
during
his
last
illness
,
there
are
several
*NL*
fine
lyrics
.
The
titles
of
these
books
are
,
`
John
Marr
and
Other
*NL*
Sailors
'
-LRB-

,
and
`
Timoleon

.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
question
that
Mr.
Melville
's
absorption
in
philosophical
*NL*
studies
was
quite
as
responsible
as
the
failure
of
his
later
books
for
*NL*
his
cessation
from
literary
productiveness
.
That
he
sometimes
realised
*NL*
the
situation
will
be
seen
by
a
passage
in
`
Moby
Dick
'
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Did
n't
I
tell
you
so
?
'
said
Flask
.
`
Yes
,
you
'll
soon
see
this
right
*NL*
whale
's
head
hoisted
up
opposite
that
parmacetti
's
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
good
time
Flask
's
saying
proved
true
.
As
before
,
the
Pequod
steeply
*NL*
leaned
over
towards
the
sperm
whale
's
head
,
now
,
by
the
counterpoise
of
*NL*
both
heads
,
she
regained
her
own
keel
,
though
sorely
strained
,
you
may
*NL*
well
believe
.
So
,
when
on
one
side
you
hoist
in
Locke
's
head
,
you
go
*NL*
over
that
way
;
but
now
,
on
the
other
side
,
hoist
in
Kant
's
and
you
*NL*
come
back
again
;
but
in
very
poor
plight
.
Thus
,
some
minds
forever
keep
*NL*
trimming
boat
.
Oh
,
ye
foolish
!
throw
all
these
thunderheads
overboard
,
*NL*
and
then
you
will
float
right
and
light
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Melville
would
have
been
more
than
mortal
if
he
had
been
indifferent
*NL*
to
his
loss
of
popularity
.
Yet
he
seemed
contented
to
preserve
an
*NL*
entirely
independent
attitude
,
and
to
trust
to
the
verdict
of
the
*NL*
future
.
The
smallest
amount
of
activity
would
have
kept
him
before
the
*NL*
public
;
but
his
reserve
would
not
permit
this
.
That
reinstatement
of
his
*NL*
reputation
can
not
be
doubted
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
editing
of
this
reissue
of
`
Melville
's
Works
,
'
I
have
been
*NL*
much
indebted
to
the
scholarly
aid
of
Dr.
Titus
Munson
Coan
,
whose
*NL*
familiarity
with
the
languages
of
the
Pacific
has
enabled
me
to
*NL*
harmonise
the
spelling
of
foreign
words
in
`
Typee
'
and
`
Omoo
,
'
though
*NL*
without
changing
the
phonetic
method
of
printing
adopted
by
Mr.
*NL*
Melville
.
Dr.
Coan
has
also
been
most
helpful
with
suggestions
in
other
*NL*
directions
.
Finally
,
the
delicate
fancy
of
La
Fargehas
supplemented
the
*NL*
immortal
pen-portrait
of
the
Typee
maiden
with
a
speaking
impersonation
*NL*
of
her
beauty
.

Six
months
at
sea
!
Yes
,
reader
,
as
I
live
,
six
months
out
of
sight
of
*NL*
land
;
cruising
after
the
sperm-whale
beneath
the
scorching
sun
of
the
*NL*
Line
,
and
tossed
on
the
billows
of
the
wide-rolling
Pacific
--
the
sky
*NL*
above
,
the
sea
around
,
and
nothing
else
!
Weeks
and
weeks
ago
our
fresh
*NL*
provisions
were
all
exhausted
.
There
is
not
a
sweet
potato
left
;
not
a
*NL*
single
yam
.
Those
glorious
bunches
of
bananas
,
which
once
decorated
*NL*
our
stern
and
quarter-deck
,
have
,
alas
,
disappeared
!
and
the
delicious
*NL*
oranges
which
hung
suspended
from
our
tops
and
stays
--
they
,
too
,
are
*NL*
gone
!
Yes
,
they
are
all
departed
,
and
there
is
nothing
left
us
but
*NL*
salt-horse
and
sea-biscuit
.
Oh
!
ye
state-room
sailors
,
who
make
so
*NL*
much
ado
about
a
fourteen-days
'
passage
across
the
Atlantic
;
who
so
*NL*
pathetically
relate
the
privations
and
hardships
of
the
sea
,
where
,
*NL*
after
a
day
of
breakfasting
,
lunching
,
dining
off
five
courses
,
*NL*
chatting
,
playing
whist
,
and
drinking
champagne-punch
,
it
was
your
hard
*NL*
lot
to
be
shut
up
in
little
cabinets
of
mahogany
and
maple
,
and
sleep
*NL*
for
ten
hours
,
with
nothing
to
disturb
you
but
`
those
good-for-nothing
*NL*
tars
,
shouting
and
tramping
overhead
'
,
--
what
would
ye
say
to
our
six
*NL*
months
out
of
sight
of
land
?
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
for
a
refreshing
glimpse
of
one
blade
of
grass
--
for
a
snuff
at
the
*NL*
fragrance
of
a
handful
of
the
loamy
earth
!
Is
there
nothing
fresh
around
*NL*
us
?
Is
there
no
green
thing
to
be
seen
?
Yes
,
the
inside
of
our
bulwarks
*NL*
is
painted
green
;
but
what
a
vile
and
sickly
hue
it
is
,
as
if
nothing
*NL*
bearing
even
the
semblance
of
verdure
could
flourish
this
weary
way
from
*NL*
land
.
Even
the
bark
that
once
clung
to
the
wood
we
use
for
fuel
has
been
*NL*
gnawed
off
and
devoured
by
the
captain
's
pig
;
and
so
long
ago
,
too
,
that
*NL*
the
pig
himself
has
in
turn
been
devoured
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
but
one
solitary
tenant
in
the
chicken-coop
,
once
a
gay
and
*NL*
dapper
young
cock
,
bearing
him
so
bravely
among
the
coy
hens
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
look
at
him
now
;
there
he
stands
,
moping
all
the
day
long
on
that
*NL*
everlasting
one
leg
of
his
.
He
turns
with
disgust
from
the
mouldy
corn
*NL*
before
him
,
and
the
brackish
water
in
his
little
trough
.
He
mourns
no
*NL*
doubt
his
lost
companions
,
literally
snatched
from
him
one
by
one
,
and
*NL*
never
seen
again
.
But
his
days
of
mourning
will
be
few
for
Mungo
,
our
*NL*
black
cook
,
told
me
yesterday
that
the
word
had
at
last
gone
forth
,
and
*NL*
poor
Pedro
's
fate
was
sealed
.
His
attenuated
body
will
be
laid
out
upon
*NL*
the
captain
's
table
next
Sunday
,
and
long
before
night
will
be
buried
*NL*
with
all
the
usual
ceremonies
beneath
that
worthy
individual
's
vest
.
Who
*NL*
would
believe
that
there
could
be
any
one
so
cruel
as
to
long
for
the
*NL*
decapitation
of
the
luckless
Pedro
;
yet
the
sailors
pray
every
minute
,
*NL*
selfish
fellows
,
that
the
miserable
fowl
may
be
brought
to
his
end
.
They
*NL*
say
the
captain
will
never
point
the
ship
for
the
land
so
long
as
he
*NL*
has
in
anticipation
a
mess
of
fresh
meat
.
This
unhappy
bird
can
alone
*NL*
furnish
it
;
and
when
he
is
once
devoured
,
the
captain
will
come
to
his
*NL*
senses
.
I
wish
thee
no
harm
,
Pedro
;
but
as
thou
art
doomed
,
sooner
or
*NL*
later
,
to
meet
the
fate
of
all
thy
race
;
and
if
putting
a
period
to
*NL*
thy
existence
is
to
be
the
signal
for
our
deliverance
,
why
--
truth
to
*NL*
speak
--
I
wish
thy
throat
cut
this
very
moment
;
for
,
oh
!
how
I
wish
to
*NL*
see
the
living
earth
again
!
The
old
ship
herself
longs
to
look
out
upon
*NL*
the
land
from
her
hawse-holes
once
more
,
and
Jack
Lewis
said
right
the
*NL*
other
day
when
the
captain
found
fault
with
his
steering
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
d'ye
see
,
Captain
Vangs
,
'
says
bold
Jack
,
`
I
'm
as
good
a
helmsman
*NL*
as
ever
put
hand
to
spoke
;
but
none
of
us
can
steer
the
old
lady
now
.
We
*NL*
ca
n't
keep
her
full
and
bye
,
sir
;
watch
her
ever
so
close
,
she
will
fall
*NL*
off
and
then
,
sir
,
when
I
put
the
helm
down
so
gently
,
and
try
like
to
*NL*
coax
her
to
the
work
,
she
wo
n't
take
it
kindly
,
but
will
fall
round
off
*NL*
again
;
and
it
's
all
because
she
knows
the
land
is
under
the
lee
,
sir
,
*NL*
and
she
wo
n't
go
any
more
to
windward
.
'
Aye
,
and
why
should
she
,
Jack
?
*NL*
did
n't
every
one
of
her
stout
timbers
grow
on
shore
,
and
has
n't
she
*NL*
sensibilities
;
as
well
as
we
?
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
old
ship
!
Her
very
looks
denote
her
desires
!
how
deplorably
she
*NL*
appears
!
The
paint
on
her
sides
,
burnt
up
by
the
scorching
sun
,
is
*NL*
puffed
out
and
cracked
.
See
the
weeds
she
trails
along
with
her
,
and
*NL*
what
an
unsightly
bunch
of
those
horrid
barnacles
has
formed
about
her
*NL*
stern-piece
;
and
every
time
she
rises
on
a
sea
,
she
shows
her
copper
*NL*
torn
away
,
or
hanging
in
jagged
strips
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
old
ship
!
I
say
again
:
for
six
months
she
has
been
rolling
and
*NL*
pitching
about
,
never
for
one
moment
at
rest
.
But
courage
,
old
lass
,
I
*NL*
hope
to
see
thee
soon
within
a
biscuit
's
toss
of
the
merry
land
,
riding
*NL*
snugly
at
anchor
in
some
green
cove
,
and
sheltered
from
the
boisterous
*NL*
winds
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hurra
,
my
lads
!
It
's
a
settled
thing
;
next
week
we
shape
our
course
to
*NL*
the
Marquesas
!
'
The
Marquesas
!
What
strange
visions
of
outlandish
things
*NL*
does
the
very
name
spirit
up
!
Naked
houris
--
cannibal
banquets
--
groves
*NL*
of
cocoanut
--
coral
reefs
--
tattooed
chiefs
--
and
bamboo
temples
;
sunny
*NL*
valleys
planted
with
bread-fruit-trees
--
carved
canoes
dancing
on
*NL*
the
flashing
blue
waters
--
savage
woodlands
guarded
by
horrible
*NL*
idols
--
HEATHENISH
RITES
AND
HUMAN
SACRIFICES
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
strangely
jumbled
anticipations
that
haunted
me
during
our
*NL*
passage
from
the
cruising
ground
.
I
felt
an
irresistible
curiosity
to
*NL*
see
those
islands
which
the
olden
voyagers
had
so
glowingly
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
group
for
which
we
were
now
steering
-LRB-
although
among
the
earliest
of
*NL*
European
discoveries
in
the
South
Seas
,
having
been
first
visited
in
*NL*
the
year
1595
-RRB-
still
continues
to
be
tenanted
by
beings
as
strange
*NL*
and
barbarous
as
ever
.
The
missionaries
sent
on
a
heavenly
errand
,
had
*NL*
sailed
by
their
lovely
shores
,
and
had
abandoned
them
to
their
idols
of
*NL*
wood
and
stone
.
How
interesting
the
circumstances
under
which
they
were
*NL*
discovered
!
In
the
watery
path
of
Mendanna
,
cruising
in
quest
of
some
*NL*
region
of
gold
,
these
isles
had
sprung
up
like
a
scene
of
enchantment
,
*NL*
and
for
a
moment
the
Spaniard
believed
his
bright
dream
was
realized
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
honour
of
the
Marquess
de
Mendoza
,
then
viceroy
of
Peru
--
under
whose
*NL*
auspices
the
navigator
sailed
--
he
bestowed
upon
them
the
name
which
*NL*
denoted
the
rank
of
his
patron
,
and
gave
to
the
world
on
his
return
*NL*
a
vague
and
magnificent
account
of
their
beauty
.
But
these
islands
,
*NL*
undisturbed
for
years
,
relapsed
into
their
previous
obscurity
;
and
it
is
*NL*
only
recently
that
anything
has
been
known
concerning
them
.
Once
in
the
*NL*
course
of
a
half
century
,
to
be
sure
,
some
adventurous
rover
would
break
*NL*
in
upon
their
peaceful
repose
,
and
astonished
at
the
unusual
scene
,
*NL*
would
be
almost
tempted
to
claim
the
merit
of
a
new
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
interesting
group
,
but
little
account
has
ever
been
given
,
if
*NL*
we
except
the
slight
mention
made
of
them
in
the
sketches
of
South-Sea
*NL*
voyages
.
Cook
,
in
his
repeated
circumnavigations
of
the
globe
,
barely
*NL*
touched
at
their
shores
;
and
all
that
we
know
about
them
is
from
a
few
*NL*
general
narratives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
these
,
there
are
two
that
claim

Porter

`
Journal
of
the
Cruise
of
the
U.S.
frigate
Essex
,
in
the
Pacific
,
*NL*
during
the
late
War
'
,
is
said
to
contain
some
interesting
particulars
*NL*
concerning
the
islanders
.
This
is
a
work
,
however
,
which
I
have
never
*NL*
happened
to
meet
with
;
and
Stewart
,
the
chaplain
of
the
American
sloop
*NL*
of
war
Vincennes
,
has
likewise
devoted
a
portion
of
his
book
,
entitled
*NL*
'
A
Visit
to
the
South
Seas
'
,
to
the
same
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
the
last
few
,
years
American
and
English
vessels
engaged
in
the
*NL*
extensive
whale
fisheries
of
the
Pacific
have
occasionally
,
when
short
*NL*
of
provisions
,
put
into
the
commodious
harbour
which
there
is
in
one
of
*NL*
the
islands
;
but
a
fear
of
the
natives
,
founded
on
the
recollection
of
*NL*
the
dreadful
fate
which
many
white
men
have
received
at
their
hands
,
has
*NL*
deterred
their
crews
from
intermixing
with
the
population
sufficiently
*NL*
to
gain
any
insight
into
their
peculiar
customs
and
manners
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Protestant
Missions
appear
to
have
despaired
of
reclaiming
these
*NL*
islands
from
heathenism
.
The
usage
they
have
in
every
case
received
from
*NL*
the
natives
has
been
such
as
to
intimidate
the
boldest
of
their
number
.
*NL*
Ellis
,
in
his
`
Polynesian
Researches
'
,
gives
some
interesting
accounts
*NL*
of
the
abortive
attempts
made
by
the
''
Tahiti
Mission
''
to
establish
a
*NL*
branch
Mission
upon
certain
islands
of
the
group
.
A
short
time
before
*NL*
my
visit
to
the
Marquesas
,
a
somewhat
amusing
incident
took
place
in
*NL*
connection
with
these
efforts
,
which
I
can
not
avoid
relating
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
intrepid
missionary
,
undaunted
by
the
ill-success
that
had
attended
*NL*
all
previous
endeavours
to
conciliate
the
savages
,
and
believing
much
*NL*
in
the
efficacy
of
female
influence
,
introduced
among
them
his
young
and
*NL*
beautiful
wife
,
the
first
white
woman
who
had
ever
visited
their
shores
.
*NL*
The
islanders
at
first
gazed
in
mute
admiration
at
so
unusual
a
prodigy
,
*NL*
and
seemed
inclined
to
regard
it
as
some
new
divinity
.
But
after
a
short
*NL*
time
,
becoming
familiar
with
its
charming
aspect
,
and
jealous
of
the
*NL*
folds
which
encircled
its
form
,
they
sought
to
pierce
the
sacred
veil
*NL*
of
calico
in
which
it
was
enshrined
,
and
in
the
gratification
of
their
*NL*
curiosity
so
far
overstepped
the
limits
of
good
breeding
,
as
deeply
*NL*
to
offend
the
lady
's
sense
of
decorum
.
Her
sex
once
ascertained
,
their
*NL*
idolatry
was
changed
into
contempt
and
there
was
no
end
to
the
contumely
*NL*
showered
upon
her
by
the
savages
,
who
were
exasperated
at
the
deception
*NL*
which
they
conceived
had
been
practised
upon
them
.
To
the
horror
of
*NL*
her
affectionate
spouse
,
she
was
stripped
of
her
garments
,
and
given
to
*NL*
understand
that
she
could
no
longer
carry
on
her
deceits
with
impunity
.
*NL*
The
gentle
dame
was
not
sufficiently
evangelical
to
endure
this
,
and
,
*NL*
fearful
of
further
improprieties
,
she
forced
her
husband
to
relinquish
*NL*
his
undertaking
,
and
together
they
returned
to
Tahiti
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
thus
shy
of
exhibiting
her
charms
was
the
Island
Queen
herself
,
the
*NL*
beauteous
wife
of
Movianna
,
the
king
of
Nukuheva
.
Between
two
and
three
*NL*
years
after
the
adventures
recorded
in
this
volume
,
I
chanced
,
while
*NL*
aboard
of
a
man-of-war
to
touch
at
these
islands
.
The
French
had
*NL*
then
held
possession
of
the
Marquesas
some
time
,
and
already
prided
*NL*
themselves
upon
the
beneficial
effects
of
their
jurisdiction
,
as
*NL*
discernible
in
the
deportment
of
the
natives
.
To
be
sure
,
in
one
of
*NL*
their
efforts
at
reform
they
had
slaughtered
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
*NL*
of
them
at
Whitihoo
--
but
let
that
pass
.
At
the
time
I
mention
,
the
*NL*
French
squadron
was
rendezvousing
in
the
bay
of
Nukuheva
,
and
during
an
*NL*
interview
between
one
of
their
captains
and
our
worthy
Commodore
,
it
*NL*
was
suggested
by
the
former
,
that
we
,
as
the
flag-ship
of
the
American
*NL*
squadron
,
should
receive
,
in
state
,
a
visit
from
the
royal
pair
.
The
*NL*
French
officer
likewise
represented
,
with
evident
satisfaction
,
that
*NL*
under
their
tuition
the
king
and
queen
had
imbibed
proper
notions
of
*NL*
their
elevated
station
,
and
on
all
ceremonious
occasions
conducted
*NL*
themselves
with
suitable
dignity
.
Accordingly
,
preparations
were
made
to
*NL*
give
their
majesties
a
reception
on
board
in
a
style
corresponding
with
*NL*
their
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
bright
afternoon
,
a
gig
,
gaily
bedizened
with
streamers
,
was
*NL*
observed
to
shove
off
from
the
side
of
one
of
the
French
frigates
,
and
*NL*
pull
directly
for
our
gangway
.
In
the
stern
sheets
reclined
Mowanna
and
*NL*
his
consort
.
As
they
approached
,
we
paid
them
all
the
honours
due
to
*NL*
royalty
;
--
manning
our
yards
,
firing
a
salute
,
and
making
a
prodigious
*NL*
hubbub
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
ascended
the
accommodation
ladder
,
were
greeted
by
the
Commodore
,
*NL*
hat
in
hand
,
and
passing
along
the
quarter-deck
,
the
marine
guard
*NL*
presented
arms
,
while
the
band
struck
up
`
The
King
of
the
Cannibal
*NL*
Islands
'
.
So
far
all
went
well
.
The
French
officers
grimaced
and
smiled
*NL*
in
exceedingly
high
spirits
,
wonderfully
pleased
with
the
discreet
*NL*
manner
in
which
these
distinguished
personages
behaved
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
appearance
was
certainly
calculated
to
produce
an
effect
.
His
*NL*
majesty
was
arrayed
in
a
magnificent
military
uniform
,
stiff
with
gold
*NL*
lace
and
embroidery
,
while
his
shaven
crown
was
concealed
by
a
huge
*NL*
chapeau
bras
,
waving
with
ostrich
plumes
.
There
was
one
slight
blemish
,
*NL*
however
,
in
his
appearance
.
A
broad
patch
of
tattooing
stretched
*NL*
completely
across
his
face
,
in
a
line
with
his
eyes
,
making
him
look
as
*NL*
if
he
wore
a
huge
pair
of
goggles
;
and
royalty
in
goggles
suggested
some
*NL*
ludicrous
ideas
.
But
it
was
in
the
adornment
of
the
fair
person
of
his
*NL*
dark-complexioned
spouse
that
the
tailors
of
the
fleet
had
evinced
the
*NL*
gaiety
of
their
national
taste
.
She
was
habited
in
a
gaudy
tissue
of
*NL*
scarlet
cloth
,
trimmed
with
yellow
silk
,
which
,
descending
a
little
*NL*
below
the
knees
,
exposed
to
view
her
bare
legs
,
embellished
with
spiral
*NL*
tattooing
,
and
somewhat
resembling
two
miniature
Trajan
's
columns
.
Upon
*NL*
her
head
was
a
fanciful
turban
of
purple
velvet
,
figured
with
silver
*NL*
sprigs
,
and
surmounted
by
a
tuft
of
variegated
feathers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ship
's
company
,
crowding
into
the
gangway
to
view
the
sight
,
soon
*NL*
arrested
her
majesty
's
attention
.
She
singled
out
from
their
number
an
*NL*
old
salt
,
whose
bare
arms
and
feet
,
and
exposed
breast
,
were
covered
*NL*
with
as
many
inscriptions
in
India
ink
as
the
lid
of
an
Egyptian
*NL*
sarcophagus
.
Notwithstanding
all
the
sly
hints
and
remonstrances
of
the
*NL*
French
officers
,
she
immediately
approached
the
man
,
and
pulling
further
*NL*
open
the
bosom
of
his
duck
frock
,
and
rolling
up
the
leg
of
his
wide
*NL*
trousers
,
she
gazed
with
admiration
at
the
bright
blue
and
vermilion
*NL*
pricking
thus
disclosed
to
view
.
She
hung
over
the
fellow
,
caressing
*NL*
him
,
and
expressing
her
delight
in
a
variety
of
wild
exclamations
and
*NL*
gestures
.
The
embarrassment
of
the
polite
Gauls
at
such
an
unlooked-for
*NL*
occurrence
may
be
easily
imagined
,
but
picture
their
consternation
,
when
*NL*
all
at
once
the
royal
lady
,
eager
to
display
the
hieroglyphics
on
her
*NL*
own
sweet
form
,
bent
forward
for
a
moment
,
and
turning
sharply
round
,
*NL*
threw
up
the
skirt
of
her
mantle
and
revealed
a
sight
from
which
the
*NL*
aghast
Frenchmen
retreated
precipitately
,
and
tumbling
into
their
boats
,
*NL*
fled
the
scene
of
so
shocking
a
catastrophe
.

STATE
OF
AFFAIRS
THAT
ENSUE
*NL*
*NL*
I
CAN
never
forget
the
eighteen
or
twenty
days
during
which
the
light
*NL*
trade-winds
were
silently
sweeping
us
towards
the
islands
.
In
pursuit
of
*NL*
the
sperm
whale
,
we
had
been
cruising
on
the
line
some
twenty
degrees
*NL*
to
the
westward
of
the
Gallipagos
;
and
all
that
we
had
to
do
,
when
our
*NL*
course
was
determined
on
,
was
to
square
in
the
yards
and
keep
the
vessel
*NL*
before
the
breeze
,
and
then
the
good
ship
and
the
steady
gale
did
the
*NL*
rest
between
them
.
The
man
at
the
wheel
never
vexed
the
old
lady
with
*NL*
any
superfluous
steering
,
but
comfortably
adjusting
his
limbs
at
the
*NL*
tiller
,
would
doze
away
by
the
hour
.
True
to
her
work
,
the
Dolly
headed
*NL*
to
her
course
,
and
like
one
of
those
characters
who
always
do
best
when
*NL*
let
alone
,
she
jogged
on
her
way
like
a
veteran
old
sea-pacer
as
she
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
delightful
,
lazy
,
languid
time
we
had
whilst
we
were
thus
gliding
*NL*
along
!
There
was
nothing
to
be
done
;
a
circumstance
that
happily
*NL*
suited
our
disinclination
to
do
anything
.
We
abandoned
the
fore-peak
*NL*
altogether
,
and
spreading
an
awning
over
the
forecastle
,
slept
,
ate
,
*NL*
and
lounged
under
it
the
live-long
day
.
Every
one
seemed
to
be
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
some
narcotic
.
Even
the
officers
aft
,
whose
duty
required
*NL*
them
never
to
be
seated
while
keeping
a
deck
watch
,
vainly
endeavoured
*NL*
to
keep
on
their
pins
;
and
were
obliged
invariably
to
compromise
the
*NL*
matter
by
leaning
up
against
the
bulwarks
,
and
gazing
abstractedly
over
*NL*
the
side
.
Reading
was
out
of
the
question
;
take
a
book
in
your
hand
,
and
*NL*
you
were
asleep
in
an
instant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
could
not
avoid
yielding
in
a
great
measure
to
the
general
*NL*
languor
,
still
at
times
I
contrived
to
shake
off
the
spell
,
and
to
*NL*
appreciate
the
beauty
of
the
scene
around
me
.
The
sky
presented
a
*NL*
clear
expanse
of
the
most
delicate
blue
,
except
along
the
skirts
of
the
*NL*
horizon
,
where
you
might
see
a
thin
drapery
of
pale
clouds
which
never
*NL*
varied
their
form
or
colour
.
The
long
,
measured
,
dirge-like
well
of
*NL*
the
Pacific
came
rolling
along
,
with
its
surface
broken
by
little
tiny
*NL*
waves
,
sparkling
in
the
sunshine
.
Every
now
and
then
a
shoal
of
flying
*NL*
fish
,
scared
from
the
water
under
the
bows
,
would
leap
into
the
air
,
*NL*
and
fall
the
next
moment
like
a
shower
of
silver
into
the
sea
.
Then
you
*NL*
would
see
the
superb
albicore
,
with
his
glittering
sides
,
sailing
aloft
,
*NL*
and
often
describing
an
arc
in
his
descent
,
disappear
on
the
surface
of
*NL*
the
water
.
Far
off
,
the
lofty
jet
of
the
whale
might
be
seen
,
and
nearer
*NL*
at
hand
the
prowling
shark
,
that
villainous
footpad
of
the
seas
,
would
*NL*
come
skulking
along
,
and
,
at
a
wary
distance
,
regard
us
with
his
evil
*NL*
eye
.
At
times
,
some
shapeless
monster
of
the
deep
,
floating
on
the
*NL*
surface
,
would
,
as
we
approached
,
sink
slowly
into
the
blue
waters
,
and
*NL*
fade
away
from
the
sight
.
But
the
most
impressive
feature
of
the
*NL*
scene
was
the
almost
unbroken
silence
that
reigned
over
sky
and
water
.
*NL*
Scarcely
a
sound
could
be
heard
but
the
occasional
breathing
of
the
*NL*
grampus
,
and
the
rippling
at
the
cut-water
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
drew
nearer
the
land
,
I
hailed
with
delight
the
appearance
of
*NL*
innumerable
sea-fowl
.
Screaming
and
whirling
in
spiral
tracks
,
they
*NL*
would
accompany
the
vessel
,
and
at
times
alight
on
our
yards
and
*NL*
stays
.
That
piratical-looking
fellow
,
appropriately
named
the
*NL*
man-of-war
's
-
hawk
,
with
his
blood-red
bill
and
raven
plumage
,
would
*NL*
come
sweeping
round
us
in
gradually
diminishing
circles
,
till
you
*NL*
could
distinctly
mark
the
strange
flashings
of
his
eye
;
and
then
,
as
if
*NL*
satisfied
with
his
observation
,
would
sail
up
into
the
air
and
disappear
*NL*
from
the
view
.
Soon
,
other
evidences
of
our
vicinity
to
the
land
were
*NL*
apparent
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
glad
announcement
of
its
being
*NL*
in
sight
was
heard
from
aloft
,
--
given
with
that
peculiar
prolongation
of
*NL*
sound
that
a
sailor
loves
--
`
Land
ho
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
,
darting
on
deck
from
the
cabin
,
bawled
lustily
for
his
*NL*
spy-glass
;
the
mate
in
still
louder
accents
hailed
the
masthead
with
a
*NL*
tremendous
`
where-away
?
'
The
black
cook
thrust
his
woolly
head
from
the
*NL*
galley
,
and
Boatswain
,
the
dog
,
leaped
up
between
the
knight-heads
,
and
*NL*
barked
most
furiously
.
Land
ho
!
Aye
,
there
it
was
.
A
hardly
perceptible
*NL*
blue
irregular
outline
,
indicating
the
bold
contour
of
the
lofty
heights
*NL*
of
Nukuheva
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
island
,
although
generally
called
one
of
the
Marquesas
,
is
by
some
*NL*
navigators
considered
as
forming
one
of
a
distinct
cluster
,
comprising
*NL*
the
islands
of
Ruhooka
,
Ropo
,
and
Nukuheva
;
upon
which
three
the
*NL*
appellation
of
the
Washington
Group
has
been
bestowed
.
They
form
a
*NL*
triangle
,
and
lie
within
the
parallels
of
8
degrees
38
''
and
9
degrees
*NL*
32
''
South
latitude
and
139
degrees
20
''
and
140
degrees
10
''
West
*NL*
longitude
from
Greenwich
.
With
how
little
propriety
they
are
to
be
*NL*
regarded
as
forming
a
separate
group
will
be
at
once
apparent
,
when
*NL*
it
is
considered
that
they
lie
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
other
*NL*
islands
,
that
is
to
say
,
less
than
a
degree
to
the
northwest
of
them
;
*NL*
that
their
inhabitants
speak
the
Marquesan
dialect
,
and
that
their
laws
,
*NL*
religion
,
and
general
customs
are
identical
.
The
only
reason
why
they
*NL*
were
ever
thus
arbitrarily
distinguished
may
be
attributed
to
the
*NL*
singular
fact
,
that
their
existence
was
altogether
unknown
to
the
world
*NL*
until
the
year
1791
,
when
they
were
discovered
by
Captain
Ingraham
,
of
*NL*
Boston
,
Massachusetts
,
nearly
two
centuries
after
the
discovery
of
the
*NL*
adjacent
islands
by
the
agent
of
the
Spanish
Viceroy
.
Notwithstanding
*NL*
this
,
I
shall
follow
the
example
of
most
voyagers
,
and
treat
of
them
as
*NL*
forming
part
and
parcel
of
Marquesas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nukuheva
is
the
most
important
of
these
islands
,
being
the
only
one
*NL*
at
which
ships
are
much
in
the
habit
of
touching
,
and
is
celebrated
as
*NL*
being
the
place
where
the
adventurous
Captain
Porter
refitted
his
ships
*NL*
during
the
late
war
between
England
and
the
United
States
,
and
whence
he
*NL*
sallied
out
upon
the
large
whaling
fleet
then
sailing
under
the
enemy
's
*NL*
flag
in
the
surrounding
seas
.
This
island
is
about
twenty
miles
in
*NL*
length
and
nearly
as
many
in
breadth
.
It
has
three
good
harbours
on
its
*NL*
coast
;
the
largest
and
best
of
which
is
called
by
the
people
living
*NL*
in
its
vicinity
`
Taiohae
'
,
and
by
Captain
Porter
was
denominated
*NL*
Massachusetts
Bay
.
Among
the
adverse
tribes
dwelling
about
the
shores
of
*NL*
the
other
bays
,
and
by
all
voyagers
,
it
is
generally
known
by
the
name
*NL*
bestowed
upon
the
island
itself
--
Nukuheva
.
Its
inhabitants
have
become
*NL*
somewhat
corrupted
,
owing
to
their
recent
commerce
with
Europeans
,
but
*NL*
so
far
as
regards
their
peculiar
customs
and
general
mode
of
life
,
they
*NL*
retain
their
original
primitive
character
,
remaining
very
nearly
in
the
*NL*
same
state
of
nature
in
which
they
were
first
beheld
by
white
men
.
The
*NL*
hostile
clans
,
residing
in
the
more
remote
sections
of
the
island
,
and
*NL*
very
seldom
holding
any
communication
with
foreigners
,
are
in
every
*NL*
respect
unchanged
from
their
earliest
known
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
bay
of
Nukuheva
was
the
anchorage
we
desired
to
reach
.
We
had
*NL*
perceived
the
loom
of
the
mountains
about
sunset
;
so
that
after
running
*NL*
all
night
with
a
very
light
breeze
,
we
found
ourselves
close
in
with
*NL*
the
island
the
next
morning
,
but
as
the
bay
we
sought
lay
on
its
farther
*NL*
side
,
we
were
obliged
to
sail
some
distance
along
the
shore
,
catching
,
*NL*
as
we
proceeded
,
short
glimpses
of
blooming
valleys
,
deep
glens
,
*NL*
waterfalls
,
and
waving
groves
hidden
here
and
there
by
projecting
and
*NL*
rocky
headlands
,
every
moment
opening
to
the
view
some
new
and
startling
*NL*
scene
of
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
for
the
first
time
visit
the
South
Sea
,
generally
are
*NL*
surprised
at
the
appearance
of
the
islands
when
beheld
from
the
sea
.
*NL*
From
the
vague
accounts
we
sometimes
have
of
their
beauty
,
many
people
*NL*
are
apt
to
picture
to
themselves
enamelled
and
softly
swelling
plains
,
*NL*
shaded
over
with
delicious
groves
,
and
watered
by
purling
brooks
,
and
*NL*
the
entire
country
but
little
elevated
above
the
surrounding
ocean
.
The
*NL*
reality
is
very
different
;
bold
rock-bound
coasts
,
with
the
surf
beating
*NL*
high
against
the
lofty
cliffs
,
and
broken
here
and
there
into
deep
*NL*
inlets
,
which
open
to
the
view
thickly-wooded
valleys
,
separated
by
the
*NL*
spurs
of
mountains
clothed
with
tufted
grass
,
and
sweeping
down
towards
*NL*
the
sea
from
an
elevated
and
furrowed
interior
,
form
the
principal
*NL*
features
of
these
islands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
noon
we
drew
abreast
the
entrance
go
the
harbour
,
and
at
last
*NL*
we
slowly
swept
by
the
intervening
promontory
,
and
entered
the
bay
of
*NL*
Nukuheva
.
No
description
can
do
justice
to
its
beauty
;
but
that
beauty
*NL*
was
lost
to
me
then
,
and
I
saw
nothing
but
the
tri-coloured
flag
of
*NL*
France
trailing
over
the
stern
of
six
vessels
,
whose
black
hulls
and
*NL*
bristling
broadsides
proclaimed
their
warlike
character
.
There
they
*NL*
were
,
floating
in
that
lovely
bay
,
the
green
eminences
of
the
shore
*NL*
looking
down
so
tranquilly
upon
them
,
as
if
rebuking
the
sternness
of
*NL*
their
aspect
.
To
my
eye
nothing
could
be
more
out
of
keeping
than
the
*NL*
presence
of
these
vessels
;
but
we
soon
learnt
what
brought
them
*NL*
there
.
The
whole
group
of
islands
had
just
been
taken
possession
of
*NL*
by
Rear-Admiral
Du
Petit
Thouars
,
in
the
name
of
the
invincible
French
*NL*
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
item
of
information
was
imparted
to
us
by
a
most
extraordinary
*NL*
individual
,
a
genuine
South-Sea
vagabond
,
who
came
alongside
of
us
in
*NL*
a
whale-boat
as
soon
as
we
entered
the
bay
,
and
,
by
the
aid
of
some
*NL*
benevolent
persons
at
the
gangway
,
was
assisted
on
board
,
for
our
*NL*
visitor
was
in
that
interesting
stage
of
intoxication
when
a
man
is
*NL*
amiable
and
helpless
.
Although
he
was
utterly
unable
to
stand
erect
or
*NL*
to
navigate
his
body
across
the
deck
,
he
still
magnanimously
proffered
*NL*
his
services
to
pilot
the
ship
to
a
good
and
secure
anchorage
.
Our
*NL*
captain
,
however
,
rather
distrusted
his
ability
in
this
respect
,
and
*NL*
refused
to
recognize
his
claim
to
the
character
he
assumed
;
but
*NL*
our
gentleman
was
determined
to
play
his
part
,
for
,
by
dint
of
much
*NL*
scrambling
,
he
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
weather-quarter
boat
,
*NL*
where
he
steadied
himself
by
holding
on
to
a
shroud
,
and
then
commenced
*NL*
issuing
his
commands
with
amazing
volubility
and
very
peculiar
gestures
.
*NL*
Of
course
no
one
obeyed
his
orders
;
but
as
it
was
impossible
to
quiet
*NL*
him
,
we
swept
by
the
ships
of
the
squadron
with
this
strange
fellow
*NL*
performing
his
antics
in
full
view
of
all
the
French
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
afterwards
learned
that
our
eccentric
friend
had
been
a
lieutenant
in
*NL*
the
English
navy
;
but
having
disgraced
his
flag
by
some
criminal
conduct
*NL*
in
one
of
the
principal
ports
on
the
main
,
he
had
deserted
his
ship
,
*NL*
and
spent
many
years
wandering
among
the
islands
of
the
Pacific
,
until
*NL*
accidentally
being
at
Nukuheva
when
the
French
took
possession
of
*NL*
the
place
,
he
had
been
appointed
pilot
of
the
harbour
by
the
newly
*NL*
constituted
authorities
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
slowly
advanced
up
the
bay
,
numerous
canoes
pushed
off
from
the
*NL*
surrounding
shores
,
and
we
were
soon
in
the
midst
of
quite
a
flotilla
*NL*
of
them
,
their
savage
occupants
struggling
to
get
aboard
of
us
,
and
*NL*
jostling
one
another
in
their
ineffectual
attempts
.
Occasionally
the
*NL*
projecting
out-riggers
of
their
slight
shallops
running
foul
of
one
*NL*
another
,
would
become
entangled
beneath
the
water
,
threatening
to
*NL*
capsize
the
canoes
,
when
a
scene
of
confusion
would
ensue
that
baffles
*NL*
description
.
Such
strange
outcries
and
passionate
gesticulations
I
never
*NL*
certainly
heard
or
saw
before
.
You
would
have
thought
the
islanders
were
*NL*
on
the
point
of
flying
at
each
other
's
throats
,
whereas
they
were
only
*NL*
amicably
engaged
in
disentangling
their
boats
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scattered
here
and
there
among
the
canoes
might
be
seen
numbers
of
*NL*
cocoanuts
floating
closely
together
in
circular
groups
,
and
bobbing
up
*NL*
and
down
with
every
wave
.
By
some
inexplicable
means
these
cocoanuts
*NL*
were
all
steadily
approaching
towards
the
ship
.
As
I
leaned
curiously
*NL*
over
the
side
,
endeavouring
to
solve
their
mysterious
movements
,
one
*NL*
mass
far
in
advance
of
the
rest
attracted
my
attention
.
In
its
centre
*NL*
was
something
I
could
take
for
nothing
else
than
a
cocoanut
,
but
which
*NL*
I
certainly
considered
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
specimens
of
the
*NL*
fruit
I
had
ever
seen
.
It
kept
twirling
and
dancing
about
among
the
rest
*NL*
in
the
most
singular
manner
,
and
as
it
drew
nearer
I
thought
it
bore
a
*NL*
remarkable
resemblance
to
the
brown
shaven
skull
of
one
of
the
savages
.
*NL*
Presently
it
betrayed
a
pair
of
eyes
,
and
soon
I
became
aware
that
what
*NL*
I
had
supposed
to
have
been
one
of
the
fruit
was
nothing
else
than
the
*NL*
head
of
an
islander
,
who
had
adopted
this
singular
method
of
bringing
*NL*
his
produce
to
market
.
The
cocoanuts
were
all
attached
to
one
another
*NL*
by
strips
of
the
husk
,
partly
torn
from
the
shell
and
rudely
fastened
*NL*
together
.
Their
proprietor
inserting
his
head
into
the
midst
of
them
,
*NL*
impelled
his
necklace
of
cocoanuts
through
the
water
by
striking
out
*NL*
beneath
the
surface
with
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
somewhat
astonished
to
perceive
that
among
the
number
of
natives
*NL*
that
surrounded
us
,
not
a
single
female
was
to
be
seen
.
At
that
time
I
*NL*
was
ignorant
of
the
fact
that
by
the
operation
of
the
`
taboo
'
the
use
of
*NL*
canoes
in
all
parts
of
the
island
is
rigorously
prohibited
to
the
entire
*NL*
sex
,
for
whom
it
is
death
even
to
be
seen
entering
one
when
hauled
on
*NL*
shore
;
consequently
,
whenever
a
Marquesan
lady
voyages
by
water
,
she
*NL*
puts
in
requisition
the
paddles
of
her
own
fair
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
approached
within
a
mile
and
a
half
perhaps
of
this
foot
of
*NL*
the
bay
,
when
some
of
the
islanders
,
who
by
this
time
had
managed
to
*NL*
scramble
aboard
of
us
at
the
risk
of
swamping
their
canoes
,
directed
our
*NL*
attention
to
a
singular
commotion
in
the
water
ahead
of
the
vessel
.
At
*NL*
first
I
imagined
it
to
be
produced
by
a
shoal
of
fish
sporting
on
the
*NL*
surface
,
but
our
savage
friends
assured
us
that
it
was
caused
by
a
shoal
*NL*
of
`
whinhenies
'
-LRB-
young
girls
-RRB-
,
who
in
this
manner
were
coming
off
from
*NL*
the
shore
to
welcome
is
.
As
they
drew
nearer
,
and
I
watched
the
rising
*NL*
and
sinking
of
their
forms
,
and
beheld
the
uplifted
right
arm
bearing
*NL*
above
the
water
the
girdle
of
tappa
,
and
their
long
dark
hair
trailing
*NL*
beside
them
as
they
swam
,
I
almost
fancied
they
could
be
nothing
else
*NL*
than
so
many
mermaids
--
and
very
like
mermaids
they
behaved
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
still
some
distance
from
the
beach
,
and
under
slow
headway
,
*NL*
when
we
sailed
right
into
the
midst
of
these
swimming
nymphs
,
and
they
*NL*
boarded
us
at
every
quarter
;
many
seizing
hold
of
the
chain-plates
and
*NL*
springing
into
the
chains
;
others
,
at
the
peril
of
being
run
over
by
*NL*
the
vessel
in
her
course
,
catching
at
the
bob-stays
,
and
wreathing
their
*NL*
slender
forms
about
the
ropes
,
hung
suspended
in
the
air
.
All
of
them
*NL*
at
length
succeeded
in
getting
up
the
ship
's
side
,
where
they
clung
*NL*
dripping
with
the
brine
and
glowing
from
the
bath
,
their
jet-black
*NL*
tresses
streaming
over
their
shoulders
,
and
half
enveloping
their
*NL*
otherwise
naked
forms
.
There
they
hung
,
sparkling
with
savage
vivacity
,
*NL*
laughing
gaily
at
one
another
,
and
chattering
away
with
infinite
glee
.
*NL*
Nor
were
they
idle
the
while
,
for
each
one
performed
the
simple
offices
*NL*
of
the
toilette
for
the
other
.
Their
luxuriant
locks
,
wound
up
and
*NL*
twisted
into
the
smallest
possible
compass
,
were
freed
from
the
briny
*NL*
element
;
the
whole
person
carefully
dried
,
and
from
a
little
round
*NL*
shell
that
passed
from
hand
to
hand
,
anointed
with
a
fragrant
oil
:
their
*NL*
adornments
were
completed
by
passing
a
few
loose
folds
of
white
tappa
,
*NL*
in
a
modest
cincture
,
around
the
waist
.
Thus
arrayed
they
no
longer
*NL*
hesitated
,
but
flung
themselves
lightly
over
the
bulwarks
,
and
were
*NL*
quickly
frolicking
about
the
decks
.
Many
of
them
went
forward
,
perching
*NL*
upon
the
headrails
or
running
out
upon
the
bowsprit
,
while
others
seated
*NL*
themselves
upon
the
taffrail
,
or
reclined
at
full
length
upon
the
boats
.
*NL*
What
a
sight
for
us
bachelor
sailors
!
How
avoid
so
dire
a
temptation
?
*NL*
For
who
could
think
of
tumbling
these
artless
creatures
overboard
,
when
*NL*
they
had
swum
miles
to
welcome
us
?
*NL*
*NL*
Their
appearance
perfectly
amazed
me
;
their
extreme
youth
,
the
*NL*
light
clear
brown
of
their
complexions
,
their
delicate
features
,
and
*NL*
inexpressibly
graceful
figures
,
their
softly
moulded
limbs
,
and
free
*NL*
unstudied
action
,
seemed
as
strange
as
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dolly
was
fairly
captured
;
and
never
I
will
say
was
vessel
carried
*NL*
before
by
such
a
dashing
and
irresistible
party
of
boarders
!
The
ship
*NL*
taken
,
we
could
not
do
otherwise
than
yield
ourselves
prisoners
,
and
for
*NL*
the
whole
period
that
she
remained
in
the
bay
,
the
Dolly
,
as
well
as
her
*NL*
crew
,
were
completely
in
the
hands
of
the
mermaids
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
after
we
had
come
to
an
anchor
the
deck
was
illuminated
*NL*
with
lanterns
,
and
this
picturesque
band
of
sylphs
,
tricked
out
with
*NL*
flowers
,
and
dressed
in
robes
of
variegated
tappa
,
got
up
a
ball
in
*NL*
great
style
.
These
females
are
passionately
fond
of
dancing
,
and
in
the
*NL*
wild
grace
and
spirit
of
the
style
excel
everything
I
have
ever
seen
.
*NL*
The
varied
dances
of
the
Marquesan
girls
are
beautiful
in
the
extreme
,
*NL*
but
there
is
an
abandoned
voluptuousness
in
their
character
which
I
dare
*NL*
not
attempt
to
describe
.

SPIRITED
*NL*
CONDUCT
OF
AN
ENGLISH
LADY
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
in
the
summer
of
1842
that
we
arrived
at
the
islands
;
the
French
*NL*
had
then
held
possession
of
them
for
several
weeks
.
During
this
time
*NL*
they
had
visited
some
of
the
principal
places
in
the
group
,
and
had
*NL*
disembarked
at
various
points
about
five
hundred
troops
.
These
were
*NL*
employed
in
constructing
works
of
defence
,
and
otherwise
providing
*NL*
against
the
attacks
of
the
natives
,
who
at
any
moment
might
be
expected
*NL*
to
break
out
in
open
hostility
.
The
islanders
looked
upon
the
people
who
*NL*
made
this
cavalier
appropriation
of
their
shores
with
mingled
feelings
*NL*
of
fear
and
detestation
.
They
cordially
hated
them
;
but
the
impulses
*NL*
of
their
resentment
were
neutralized
by
their
dread
of
the
floating
*NL*
batteries
,
which
lay
with
their
fatal
tubes
ostentatiously
pointed
,
*NL*
not
at
fortifications
and
redoubts
,
but
at
a
handful
of
bamboo
sheds
,
*NL*
sheltered
in
a
grove
of
cocoanuts
!
A
valiant
warrior
doubtless
,
but
*NL*
a
prudent
one
too
,
was
this
same
Rear-Admiral
Du
Petit
Thouars
.
Four
*NL*
heavy
,
doublebanked
frigates
and
three
corvettes
to
frighten
a
parcel
of
*NL*
naked
heathen
into
subjection
!
Sixty-eight
pounders
to
demolish
huts
of
*NL*
cocoanut
boughs
,
and
Congreve
rockets
to
set
on
fire
a
few
canoe
sheds
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
Nukuheva
,
there
were
about
one
hundred
soldiers
ashore
.
They
were
*NL*
encamped
in
tents
,
constructed
of
the
old
sails
and
spare
spars
of
*NL*
the
squadron
,
within
the
limits
of
a
redoubt
mounted
with
a
few
*NL*
nine-pounders
,
and
surrounded
with
a
fosse
.
Every
other
day
,
these
*NL*
troops
were
marched
out
in
martial
array
,
to
a
level
piece
of
ground
*NL*
in
the
vicinity
,
and
there
for
hours
went
through
all
sorts
of
military
*NL*
evolutions
,
surrounded
by
flocks
of
the
natives
,
who
looked
on
with
*NL*
savage
admiration
at
the
show
,
and
as
savage
a
hatred
of
the
actors
.
*NL*
A
regiment
of
the
Old
Guard
,
reviewed
on
a
summer
's
day
in
the
Champs
*NL*
Elysees
,
could
not
have
made
a
more
critically
correct
appearance
.
The
*NL*
officers
'
regimentals
,
resplendent
with
gold
lace
and
embroidery
as
if
*NL*
purposely
calculated
to
dazzle
the
islanders
,
looked
as
if
just
unpacked
*NL*
from
their
Parisian
cases
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sensation
produced
by
the
presence
of
the
strangers
had
not
in
the
*NL*
least
subsided
at
the
period
of
our
arrival
at
the
islands
.
The
natives
*NL*
still
flocked
in
numbers
about
the
encampment
,
and
watched
with
the
*NL*
liveliest
curiosity
everything
that
was
going
forward
.
A
blacksmith
's
*NL*
forge
,
which
had
been
set
up
in
the
shelter
of
a
grove
near
the
beach
,
*NL*
attracted
so
great
a
crowd
,
that
it
required
the
utmost
efforts
of
the
*NL*
sentries
posted
around
to
keep
the
inquisitive
multitude
at
a
sufficient
*NL*
distance
to
allow
the
workmen
to
ply
their
vocation
.
But
nothing
gained
*NL*
so
large
a
share
of
admiration
as
a
horse
,
which
had
been
brought
from
*NL*
Valparaiso
by
the
Achille
,
one
of
the
vessels
of
the
squadron
.
The
*NL*
animal
,
a
remarkably
fine
one
,
had
been
taken
ashore
,
and
stabled
in
a
*NL*
hut
of
cocoanut
boughs
within
the
fortified
enclosure
.
Occasionally
it
*NL*
was
brought
out
,
and
,
being
gaily
caparisoned
,
was
ridden
by
one
of
the
*NL*
officers
at
full
speed
over
the
hard
sand
beach
.
This
performance
was
*NL*
sure
to
be
hailed
with
loud
plaudits
,
and
the
`
puarkee
nuee
'
-LRB-
big
hog
-RRB-
*NL*
was
unanimously
pronounced
by
the
islanders
to
be
the
most
extraordinary
*NL*
specimen
of
zoology
that
had
ever
come
under
their
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
expedition
for
the
occupation
of
the
Marquesas
had
sailed
from
Brest
*NL*
in
the
spring
of
1842
,
and
the
secret
of
its
destination
was
solely
in
*NL*
the
possession
of
its
commander
.
No
wonder
that
those
who
contemplated
*NL*
such
a
signal
infraction
of
the
rights
of
humanity
should
have
sought
to
*NL*
veil
the
enormity
from
the
eyes
of
the
world
.
And
yet
,
notwithstanding
*NL*
their
iniquitous
conduct
in
this
and
in
other
matters
,
the
French
*NL*
have
ever
plumed
themselves
upon
being
the
most
humane
and
polished
of
*NL*
nations
.
A
high
degree
of
refinement
,
however
,
does
not
seem
to
subdue
*NL*
our
wicked
propensities
so
much
after
all
;
and
were
civilization
itself
*NL*
to
be
estimated
by
some
of
its
results
,
it
would
seem
perhaps
better
for
*NL*
what
we
call
the
barbarous
part
of
the
world
to
remain
unchanged
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
example
of
the
shameless
subterfuges
under
which
the
French
stand
*NL*
prepared
to
defend
whatever
cruelties
they
may
hereafter
think
fit
to
*NL*
commit
in
bringing
the
Marquesan
natives
into
subjection
is
well
worthy
*NL*
of
being
recorded
.
On
some
flimsy
pretext
or
other
Mowanna
,
the
king
of
*NL*
Nukuheva
,
whom
the
invaders
by
extravagant
presents
had
cajoled
over
to
*NL*
their
interests
,
and
moved
about
like
a
mere
puppet
,
has
been
set
up
*NL*
as
the
rightful
sovereign
of
the
entire
island
--
the
alleged
ruler
by
*NL*
prescription
of
various
clans
,
who
for
ages
perhaps
have
treated
with
*NL*
each
other
as
separate
nations
.
To
reinstate
this
much-injured
prince
in
*NL*
the
assumed
dignities
of
his
ancestors
,
the
disinterested
strangers
have
*NL*
come
all
the
way
from
France
:
they
are
determined
that
his
title
shall
*NL*
be
acknowledged
.
If
any
tribe
shall
refuse
to
recognize
the
authority
*NL*
of
the
French
,
by
bowing
down
to
the
laced
chapeau
of
Mowanna
,
let
them
*NL*
abide
the
consequences
of
their
obstinacy
.
Under
cover
of
a
similar
*NL*
pretence
,
have
the
outrages
and
massacres
at
Tahiti
the
beautiful
,
the
*NL*
queen
of
the
South
Seas
,
been
perpetrated
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
buccaneering
expedition
,
Rear
Admiral
Du
Petit
Thouars
,
leaving
*NL*
the
rest
of
his
squadron
at
the
Marquesas
,
--
which
had
then
been
occupied
*NL*
by
his
forces
about
five
months
--
set
sail
for
the
doomed
island
in
*NL*
the
Reine
Blanche
frigate
.
On
his
arrival
,
as
an
indemnity
for
alleged
*NL*
insults
offered
to
the
flag
of
his
country
,
he
demanded
some
twenty
*NL*
or
thirty
thousand
dollars
to
be
placed
in
his
hands
forthwith
,
and
in
*NL*
default
of
payment
,
threatened
to
land
and
take
possession
of
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
frigate
,
immediately
upon
coming
to
an
anchor
,
got
springs
on
her
*NL*
cables
,
and
with
her
guns
cast
loose
and
her
men
at
their
quarters
,
lay
*NL*
in
the
circular
basin
of
Papeete
,
with
her
broadside
bearing
upon
the
*NL*
devoted
town
;
while
her
numerous
cutters
,
hauled
in
order
alongside
,
*NL*
were
ready
to
effect
a
landing
,
under
cover
of
her
batteries
.
She
*NL*
maintained
this
belligerent
attitude
for
several
days
,
during
which
time
*NL*
a
series
of
informal
negotiations
were
pending
,
and
wide
alarm
spread
*NL*
over
the
island
.
Many
of
the
Tahitians
were
at
first
disposed
to
resort
*NL*
to
arms
,
and
drive
the
invaders
from
their
shores
;
but
more
pacific
and
*NL*
feebler
counsels
ultimately
prevailed
.
The
unfortunate
queen
Pomare
,
*NL*
incapable
of
averting
the
impending
calamity
,
terrified
at
the
arrogance
*NL*
of
the
insolent
Frenchman
,
and
driven
at
last
to
despair
,
fled
by
night
*NL*
in
a
canoe
to
Emio
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
continuance
of
the
panic
there
occurred
an
instance
of
*NL*
feminine
heroism
that
I
can
not
omit
to
record
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
grounds
of
the
famous
missionary
consul
,
Pritchard
,
then
absent
*NL*
in
London
,
the
consular
flag
of
Britain
waved
as
usual
during
the
day
,
*NL*
from
a
lofty
staff
planted
within
a
few
yards
of
the
beach
,
and
in
full
*NL*
view
of
the
frigate
.
One
morning
an
officer
,
at
the
head
of
a
party
*NL*
of
men
,
presented
himself
at
the
verandah
of
Mr
Pritchard
's
house
,
and
*NL*
inquired
in
broken
English
for
the
lady
his
wife
.
The
matron
soon
made
*NL*
her
appearance
;
and
the
polite
Frenchman
,
making
one
of
his
best
bows
,
*NL*
and
playing
gracefully
with
the
aiguillettes
that
danced
upon
his
*NL*
breast
,
proceeded
in
courteous
accents
to
deliver
his
mission
.
`
The
*NL*
admiral
desired
the
flag
to
be
hauled
down
--
hoped
it
would
be
perfectly
*NL*
agreeable
--
and
his
men
stood
ready
to
perform
the
duty
.
'
`
Tell
the
*NL*
Pirate
your
master
,
'
replied
the
spirited
Englishwoman
,
pointing
to
*NL*
the
staff
,
`
that
if
he
wishes
to
strike
these
colours
,
he
must
come
and
*NL*
perform
the
act
himself
;
I
will
suffer
no
one
else
to
do
it
.
'
The
lady
*NL*
then
bowed
haughtily
and
withdrew
into
the
house
.
As
the
discomfited
*NL*
officer
slowly
walked
away
,
he
looked
up
to
the
flag
,
and
perceived
that
*NL*
the
cord
by
which
it
was
elevated
to
its
place
,
led
from
the
top
of
the
*NL*
staff
,
across
the
lawn
,
to
an
open
upper
window
of
the
mansion
,
where
*NL*
sat
the
lady
from
whom
he
had
just
parted
,
tranquilly
engaged
in
*NL*
knitting
.
Was
that
flag
hauled
down
?
Mrs
Pritchard
thinks
not
;
and
*NL*
Rear-Admiral
Du
Petit
Thouars
is
believed
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
.

INTERVIEW
BETWEEN
THE

*NL*
KING
AND
THE
FRENCH
ADMIRAL
*NL*
*NL*
OUR
ship
had
not
been
many
days
in
the
harbour
of
Nukuheva
before
I
came
*NL*
to
the
determination
of
leaving
her
.
That
my
reasons
for
resolving
to
*NL*
take
this
step
were
numerous
and
weighty
,
may
be
inferred
from
the
fact
*NL*
that
I
chose
rather
to
risk
my
fortunes
among
the
savages
of
the
island
*NL*
than
to
endure
another
voyage
on
board
the
Dolly
.
To
use
the
concise
,
*NL*
pointblank
phrase
of
the
sailors
.
I
had
made
up
my
mind
to
`
run
away
'
.
*NL*
Now
as
a
meaning
is
generally
attached
to
these
two
words
no
way
*NL*
flattering
to
the
individual
to
whom
they
are
applied
,
it
behoves
*NL*
me
,
for
the
sake
of
my
own
character
,
to
offer
some
explanation
of
my
*NL*
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
entered
on
board
the
Dolly
,
I
signed
as
a
matter
of
course
the
*NL*
ship
's
articles
,
thereby
voluntarily
engaging
and
legally
binding
*NL*
myself
to
serve
in
a
certain
capacity
for
the
period
of
the
voyage
;
*NL*
and
,
special
considerations
apart
,
I
was
of
course
bound
to
fulfill
the
*NL*
agreement
.
But
in
all
contracts
,
if
one
party
fail
to
perform
his
share
*NL*
of
the
compact
,
is
not
the
other
virtually
absolved
from
his
liability
?
*NL*
Who
is
there
who
will
not
answer
in
the
affirmative
?
*NL*
*NL*
Having
settled
the
principle
,
then
,
let
me
apply
it
to
the
particular
*NL*
case
in
question
.
In
numberless
instances
had
not
only
the
implied
but
*NL*
the
specified
conditions
of
the
articles
been
violated
on
the
part
of
*NL*
the
ship
in
which
I
served
.
The
usage
on
board
of
her
was
tyrannical
;
*NL*
the
sick
had
been
inhumanly
neglected
;
the
provisions
had
been
doled
out
*NL*
in
scanty
allowance
;
and
her
cruises
were
unreasonably
protracted
.
The
*NL*
captain
was
the
author
of
the
abuses
;
it
was
in
vain
to
think
that
he
*NL*
would
either
remedy
them
,
or
alter
his
conduct
,
which
was
arbitrary
*NL*
and
violent
in
the
extreme
.
His
prompt
reply
to
all
complaints
and
*NL*
remonstrances
was
--
the
butt-end
of
a
handspike
,
so
convincingly
*NL*
administered
as
effectually
to
silence
the
aggrieved
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
whom
could
we
apply
for
redress
?
We
had
left
both
law
and
equity
*NL*
on
the
other
side
of
the
Cape
;
and
unfortunately
,
with
a
very
few
*NL*
exceptions
,
our
crew
was
composed
of
a
parcel
of
dastardly
and
*NL*
meanspirited
wretches
,
divided
among
themselves
,
and
only
united
in
*NL*
enduring
without
resistance
the
unmitigated
tyranny
of
the
captain
.
*NL*
It
would
have
been
mere
madness
for
any
two
or
three
of
the
number
,
*NL*
unassisted
by
the
rest
,
to
attempt
making
a
stand
against
his
ill
*NL*
usage
.
They
would
only
have
called
down
upon
themselves
the
particular
*NL*
vengeance
of
this
`
Lord
of
the
Plank
'
,
and
subjected
their
shipmates
to
*NL*
additional
hardships
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
after
all
,
these
things
could
have
been
endured
awhile
,
had
we
*NL*
entertained
the
hope
of
being
speedily
delivered
from
them
by
the
due
*NL*
completion
of
the
term
of
our
servitude
.
But
what
a
dismal
prospect
*NL*
awaited
us
in
this
quarter
!
The
longevity
of
Cape
Horn
whaling
voyages
*NL*
is
proverbial
,
frequently
extending
over
a
period
of
four
or
five
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
long-haired
,
bare-necked
youths
,
who
,
forced
by
the
united
*NL*
influences
of
Captain
Marryatt
and
hard
times
,
embark
at
Nantucket
for
*NL*
a
pleasure
excursion
to
the
Pacific
,
and
whose
anxious
mothers
provide
*NL*
them
,
with
bottled
milk
for
the
occasion
,
oftentimes
return
very
*NL*
respectable
middle-aged
gentlemen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
preparations
made
for
one
of
these
expeditions
are
enough
to
*NL*
frighten
one
.
As
the
vessel
carries
out
no
cargo
,
her
hold
is
filled
*NL*
with
provisions
for
her
own
consumption
.
The
owners
,
who
officiate
*NL*
as
caterers
for
the
voyage
,
supply
the
larder
with
an
abundance
*NL*
of
dainties
.
Delicate
morsels
of
beef
and
pork
,
cut
on
scientific
*NL*
principles
from
every
part
of
the
animal
,
and
of
all
conceivable
shapes
*NL*
and
sizes
,
are
carefully
packed
in
salt
,
and
stored
away
in
barrels
;
*NL*
affording
a
never-ending
variety
in
their
different
degrees
of
*NL*
toughness
,
and
in
the
peculiarities
of
their
saline
properties
.
Choice
*NL*
old
water
too
,
decanted
into
stout
six-barrel-casks
,
and
two
pints
of
*NL*
which
is
allowed
every
day
to
each
soul
on
board
;
together
with
ample
*NL*
store
of
sea-bread
,
previously
reduced
to
a
state
of
petrifaction
,
with
*NL*
a
view
to
preserve
it
either
from
decay
or
consumption
in
the
ordinary
*NL*
mode
,
are
likewise
provided
for
the
nourishment
and
gastronomic
*NL*
enjoyment
of
the
crew
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
to
speak
of
the
quality
of
these
articles
of
sailors
'
fare
,
*NL*
the
abundance
in
which
they
are
put
onboard
a
whaling
vessel
is
almost
*NL*
incredible
.
Oftentimes
,
when
we
had
occasion
to
break
out
in
the
hold
,
*NL*
and
I
beheld
the
successive
tiers
of
casks
and
barrels
,
whose
contents
*NL*
were
all
destined
to
be
consumed
in
due
course
by
the
ship
's
company
,
my
*NL*
heart
has
sunk
within
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
,
as
a
general
case
,
a
ship
unlucky
in
falling
in
with
*NL*
whales
continues
to
cruise
after
them
until
she
has
barely
sufficient
*NL*
provisions
remaining
to
take
her
home
,
turning
round
then
quietly
and
*NL*
making
the
best
of
her
way
to
her
friends
,
yet
there
are
instances
when
*NL*
even
this
natural
obstacle
to
the
further
prosecution
of
the
voyage
*NL*
is
overcome
by
headstrong
captains
,
who
,
bartering
the
fruits
of
their
*NL*
hard-earned
toils
for
a
new
supply
of
provisions
in
some
of
the
ports
*NL*
of
Chili
or
Peru
,
begin
the
voyage
afresh
with
unabated
zeal
and
*NL*
perseverance
.
It
is
in
vain
that
the
owners
write
urgent
letters
to
him
*NL*
to
sail
for
home
,
and
for
their
sake
to
bring
back
the
ship
,
since
it
*NL*
appears
he
can
put
nothing
in
her
.
Not
he
.
He
has
registered
a
vow
:
he
*NL*
will
fill
his
vessel
with
good
sperm
oil
,
or
failing
to
do
so
,
never
*NL*
again
strike
Yankee
soundings
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
heard
of
one
whaler
,
which
after
many
years
'
absence
was
given
up
for
*NL*
lost
.
The
last
that
had
been
heard
of
her
was
a
shadowy
report
of
her
*NL*
having
touched
at
some
of
those
unstable
islands
in
the
far
Pacific
,
*NL*
whose
eccentric
wanderings
are
carefully
noted
in
each
new
edition
*NL*
of
the
South-Sea
charts
.
After
a
long
interval
,
however
,
`
The
*NL*
Perseverance
'
--
for
that
was
her
name
--
was
spoken
somewhere
in
the
*NL*
vicinity
of
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
cruising
along
as
leisurely
as
ever
,
*NL*
her
sails
all
bepatched
and
be
quilted
with
rope-yarns
,
her
spars
fished
*NL*
with
old
pipe
staves
,
and
her
rigging
knotted
and
spliced
in
every
*NL*
possible
direction
.
Her
crew
was
composed
of
some
twenty
venerable
*NL*
Greenwich-pensioner-looking
old
salts
,
who
just
managed
to
hobble
about
*NL*
deck
.
The
ends
of
all
the
running
ropes
,
with
the
exception
of
the
*NL*
signal
halyards
and
poop-down-haul
,
were
rove
through
snatch-blocks
,
and
*NL*
led
to
the
capstan
or
windlass
,
so
that
not
a
yard
was
braced
or
a
sail
*NL*
set
without
the
assistance
of
machinery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hull
was
encrusted
with
barnacles
,
which
completely
encased
her
.
*NL*
Three
pet
sharks
followed
in
her
wake
,
and
every
day
came
alongside
to
*NL*
regale
themselves
from
the
contents
of
the
cook
's
bucket
,
which
were
*NL*
pitched
over
to
them
.
A
vast
shoal
of
bonetas
and
albicores
always
kept
*NL*
her
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
account
I
heard
of
this
vessel
and
the
remembrance
of
it
*NL*
always
haunted
me
;
what
eventually
became
of
her
I
never
learned
;
at
*NL*
any
rate
:
he
never
reached
home
,
and
I
suppose
she
is
still
regularly
*NL*
tacking
twice
in
the
twenty-four
hours
somewhere
off
Desolate
Island
,
or
*NL*
the
Devil
's
-
Tail
Peak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
said
thus
much
touching
the
usual
length
of
these
voyages
,
when
I
*NL*
inform
the
reader
that
ours
had
as
it
were
just
commenced
,
we
being
only
*NL*
fifteen
months
out
,
and
even
at
that
time
hailed
as
a
late
arrival
and
*NL*
boarded
for
news
,
he
will
readily
perceive
that
there
was
little
to
*NL*
encourage
one
in
looking
forward
to
the
future
,
especially
as
I
had
*NL*
always
had
a
presentiment
that
we
should
make
an
unfortunate
voyage
,
and
*NL*
our
experience
so
far
had
justified
the
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
may
here
state
,
and
on
my
faith
as
an
honest
man
,
that
though
more
*NL*
than
three
years
have
elapsed
since
I
left
this
same
identical
vessel
,
*NL*
she
still
continues
;
in
the
Pacific
,
and
but
a
few
days
since
I
saw
*NL*
her
reported
in
the
papers
as
having
touched
at
the
Sandwich
Islands
*NL*
previous
to
going
on
the
coast
of
Japan
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
my
narrative
.
Placed
in
these
circumstances
then
,
with
*NL*
no
prospect
of
matters
mending
if
I
remained
aboard
the
Dolly
,
I
at
once
*NL*
made
up
my
mind
to
leave
her
:
to
be
sure
it
was
rather
an
inglorious
*NL*
thing
to
steal
away
privily
from
those
at
whose
hands
I
had
received
*NL*
wrongs
and
outrages
that
I
could
not
resent
;
but
how
was
such
a
course
*NL*
to
be
avoided
when
it
was
the
only
alternative
left
me
?
Having
made
*NL*
up
my
mind
,
I
proceeded
to
acquire
all
the
information
I
could
obtain
*NL*
relating
to
the
island
and
its
inhabitants
,
with
a
view
of
shaping
my
*NL*
plans
of
escape
accordingly
.
The
result
of
these
inquiries
I
will
now
*NL*
state
,
in
order
that
the
ensuing
narrative
may
be
the
better
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bay
of
Nukuheva
in
which
we
were
then
lying
is
an
expanse
of
*NL*
water
not
unlike
in
figure
the
space
included
within
the
limits
of
a
*NL*
horse-shoe
.
It
is
,
perhaps
,
nine
miles
in
circumference
.
You
approach
*NL*
it
from
the
sea
by
a
narrow
entrance
,
flanked
on
each
side
by
two
small
*NL*
twin
islets
which
soar
conically
to
the
height
of
some
five
hundred
*NL*
feet
.
From
these
the
shore
recedes
on
both
hands
,
and
describes
a
deep
*NL*
semicircle
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
verge
of
the
water
the
land
rises
uniformly
on
all
sides
,
with
*NL*
green
and
sloping
acclivities
,
until
from
gently
rolling
hill-sides
*NL*
and
moderate
elevations
it
insensibly
swells
into
lofty
and
majestic
*NL*
heights
,
whose
blue
outlines
,
ranged
all
around
,
close
in
the
view
.
The
*NL*
beautiful
aspect
of
the
shore
is
heightened
by
deep
and
romantic
*NL*
glens
,
which
come
down
to
it
at
almost
equal
distances
,
all
apparently
*NL*
radiating
from
a
common
centre
,
and
the
upper
extremities
of
which
are
*NL*
lost
to
the
eye
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
mountains
.
Down
each
of
these
*NL*
little
valleys
flows
a
clear
stream
,
here
and
there
assuming
the
form
*NL*
of
a
slender
cascade
,
then
stealing
invisibly
along
until
it
bursts
*NL*
upon
the
sight
again
in
larger
and
more
noisy
waterfalls
,
and
at
last
*NL*
demurely
wanders
along
to
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
houses
of
the
natives
,
constructed
of
the
yellow
bamboo
,
tastefully
*NL*
twisted
together
in
a
kind
of
wicker-work
,
and
thatched
with
the
long
*NL*
tapering
leaves
of
the
palmetto
,
are
scattered
irregularly
along
these
*NL*
valleys
beneath
the
shady
branches
of
the
cocoanut
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
can
exceed
the
imposing
scenery
of
this
bay
.
Viewed
from
our
*NL*
ship
as
she
lay
at
anchor
in
the
middle
of
the
harbour
,
it
presented
the
*NL*
appearance
of
a
vast
natural
amphitheatre
in
decay
,
and
overgrown
with
*NL*
vines
,
the
deep
glens
that
furrowed
it
's
sides
appearing
like
enormous
*NL*
fissures
caused
by
the
ravages
of
time
.
Very
often
when
lost
in
*NL*
admiration
at
its
beauty
,
I
have
experienced
a
pang
of
regret
that
a
*NL*
scene
so
enchanting
should
be
hidden
from
the
world
in
these
remote
*NL*
seas
,
and
seldom
meet
the
eyes
of
devoted
lovers
of
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
bay
the
shores
of
the
island
are
indented
by
several
other
*NL*
extensive
inlets
,
into
which
descend
broad
and
verdant
valleys
.
These
*NL*
are
inhabited
by
as
many
distinct
tribes
of
savages
,
who
,
although
*NL*
speaking
kindred
dialects
of
a
common
language
,
and
having
the
same
*NL*
religion
and
laws
,
have
from
time
immemorial
waged
hereditary
warfare
*NL*
against
each
other
.
The
intervening
mountains
generally
two
or
three
*NL*
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
geographically
define
the
*NL*
territories
of
each
of
these
hostile
tribes
,
who
never
cross
them
,
save
*NL*
on
some
expedition
of
war
or
plunder
.
Immediately
adjacent
to
Nukuheva
,
*NL*
and
only
separated
from
it
by
the
mountains
seen
from
the
harbour
,
lies
*NL*
the
lovely
valley
of
Happar
,
whose
inmates
cherish
the
most
friendly
*NL*
relations
with
the
inhabitants
of
Nukuheva
.
On
the
other
side
of
Happar
,
*NL*
and
closely
adjoining
it
,
is
the
magnificent
valley
of
the
dreaded
*NL*
Typees
,
the
unappeasable
enemies
of
both
these
tribes
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
celebrated
warriors
appear
to
inspire
the
other
islanders
with
*NL*
unspeakable
terrors
.
Their
very
name
is
a
frightful
one
;
for
the
word
*NL*
`
Typee
'
in
the
Marquesan
dialect
signifies
a
lover
of
human
flesh
.
It
*NL*
is
rather
singular
that
the
title
should
have
been
bestowed
upon
them
*NL*
exclusively
,
inasmuch
as
the
natives
of
all
this
group
are
irreclaimable
*NL*
cannibals
.
The
name
may
,
perhaps
,
have
been
given
to
denote
the
peculiar
*NL*
ferocity
of
this
clan
,
and
to
convey
a
special
stigma
along
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
same
Typees
enjoy
a
prodigious
notoriety
all
over
the
islands
.
The
*NL*
natives
of
Nukuheva
would
frequently
recount
in
pantomime
to
our
ship
's
*NL*
company
their
terrible
feats
,
and
would
show
the
marks
of
wounds
they
*NL*
had
received
in
desperate
encounters
with
them
.
When
ashore
they
would
*NL*
try
to
frighten
us
by
pointing
,
to
one
of
their
own
number
,
and
calling
*NL*
him
a
Typee
,
manifesting
no
little
surprise
that
we
did
not
take
to
our
*NL*
heels
at
so
terrible
an
announcement
.
It
was
quite
amusing
,
too
,
to
see
*NL*
with
what
earnestness
they
disclaimed
all
cannibal
propensities
on
their
*NL*
own
part
,
while
they
denounced
their
enemies
--
the
Typees
--
as
inveterate
*NL*
gourmandizers
of
human
flesh
;
but
this
is
a
peculiarity
to
which
I
shall
*NL*
hereafter
have
occasion
to
allude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
was
convinced
that
the
inhabitants
of
our
bay
were
as
arrant
*NL*
cannibals
as
any
of
the
other
tribes
on
the
island
,
still
I
could
not
*NL*
but
feel
a
particular
and
most
unqualified
repugnance
to
the
aforesaid
*NL*
Typees
.
Even
before
visiting
the
Marquesas
,
I
had
heard
from
men
who
*NL*
had
touched
at
the
group
on
former
voyages
some
revolting
stories
in
*NL*
connection
with
these
savages
;
and
fresh
in
my
remembrance
was
the
*NL*
adventure
of
the
master
of
the
Katherine
,
who
only
a
few
months
*NL*
previous
,
imprudently
venturing
into
this
bay
in
an
armed
boat
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
barter
,
was
seized
by
the
natives
,
carried
back
a
little
*NL*
distance
into
their
valley
,
and
was
only
saved
from
a
cruel
death
by
the
*NL*
intervention
of
a
young
girl
,
who
facilitated
his
escape
by
night
along
*NL*
the
beach
to
Nukuheva
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
heard
too
of
an
English
vessel
that
many
years
ago
,
after
a
weary
*NL*
cruise
,
sought
to
enter
the
bay
of
Nukuheva
,
and
arriving
within
two
or
*NL*
three
miles
of
the
land
,
was
met
by
a
large
canoe
filled
with
natives
,
*NL*
who
offered
to
lead
the
way
to
the
place
of
their
destination
.
The
*NL*
captain
,
unacquainted
with
the
localities
of
the
island
,
joyfully
*NL*
acceded
to
the
proposition
--
the
canoe
paddled
on
,
the
ship
followed
.
She
*NL*
was
soon
conducted
to
a
beautiful
inlet
,
and
dropped
her
anchor
in
*NL*
its
waters
beneath
the
shadows
of
the
lofty
shore
.
That
same
night
the
*NL*
perfidious
Typees
,
who
had
thus
inveigled
her
into
their
fatal
bay
,
*NL*
flocked
aboard
the
doomed
vessel
by
hundreds
,
and
at
a
given
signal
*NL*
murdered
every
soul
on
board
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
never
forget
the
observation
of
one
of
our
crew
as
we
were
*NL*
passing
slowly
by
the
entrance
of
the
bay
in
our
way
to
Nukuheva
.
As
we
*NL*
stood
gazing
over
the
side
at
the
verdant
headlands
,
Ned
,
pointing
*NL*
with
his
hand
in
the
direction
of
the
treacherous
valley
,
exclaimed
,
*NL*
`
There
--
there
's
Typee
.
Oh
,
the
bloody
cannibals
,
what
a
meal
they
'd
make
*NL*
of
us
if
we
were
to
take
it
into
our
heads
to
land
!
but
they
say
they
*NL*
do
n't
like
sailor
's
flesh
,
it
's
too
salt
.
I
say
,
maty
,
how
should
you
*NL*
like
to
be
shoved
ashore
there
,
eh
?
'
I
little
thought
,
as
I
shuddered
*NL*
at
the
question
,
that
in
the
space
of
a
few
weeks
I
should
actually
be
a
*NL*
captive
in
that
self-same
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
,
although
they
had
gone
through
the
ceremony
of
hoisting
*NL*
their
colours
for
a
few
hours
at
all
the
principal
places
of
the
*NL*
group
,
had
not
as
yet
visited
the
bay
of
Typee
,
anticipating
a
fierce
*NL*
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
savages
there
,
which
for
the
present
at
*NL*
least
they
wished
to
avoid
.
Perhaps
they
were
not
a
little
influenced
in
*NL*
the
adoption
of
this
unusual
policy
from
a
recollection
of
the
warlike
*NL*
reception
given
by
the
Typees
to
the
forces
of
Captain
Porter
,
about
*NL*
the
year
1814
,
when
that
brave
and
accomplished
officer
endeavoured
to
*NL*
subjugate
the
clan
merely
to
gratify
the
mortal
hatred
of
his
allies
the
*NL*
Nukuhevas
and
Happars
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
occasion
I
have
been
told
that
a
considerable
detachment
of
*NL*
sailors
and
marines
from
the
frigate
Essex
,
accompanied
by
at
least
two
*NL*
thousand
warriors
of
Happar
and
Nukuheva
,
landed
in
boats
and
canoes
at
*NL*
the
head
of
the
bay
,
and
after
penetrating
a
little
distance
into
the
*NL*
valley
,
met
with
the
stoutest
resistance
from
its
inmates
.
Valiantly
,
*NL*
although
with
much
loss
,
the
Typees
disputed
every
inch
of
ground
,
and
*NL*
after
some
hard
fighting
obliged
their
assailants
to
retreat
and
abandon
*NL*
their
design
of
conquest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
invaders
,
on
their
march
back
to
the
sea
,
consoled
themselves
for
*NL*
their
repulse
by
setting
fire
to
every
house
and
temple
in
their
route
;
*NL*
and
a
long
line
of
smoking
ruins
defaced
the
once-smiling
bosom
of
the
*NL*
valley
,
and
proclaimed
to
its
pagan
inhabitants
the
spirit
that
reigned
*NL*
in
the
breasts
of
Christian
soldiers
.
Who
can
wonder
at
the
deadly
*NL*
hatred
of
the
Typees
to
all
foreigners
after
such
unprovoked
atrocities
?
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
is
that
they
whom
we
denominate
`
savages
'
are
made
to
deserve
*NL*
the
title
.
When
the
inhabitants
of
some
sequestered
island
first
descry
*NL*
the
`
big
canoe
'
of
the
European
rolling
through
the
blue
waters
towards
*NL*
their
shores
,
they
rush
down
to
the
beach
in
crowds
,
and
with
open
arms
*NL*
stand
ready
to
embrace
the
strangers
.
Fatal
embrace
!
They
fold
to
their
*NL*
bosom
the
vipers
whose
sting
is
destined
to
poison
all
their
joys
;
and
*NL*
the
instinctive
feeling
of
love
within
their
breast
is
soon
converted
*NL*
into
the
bitterest
hate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
enormities
perpetrated
in
the
South
Seas
upon
some
of
the
*NL*
inoffensive
islanders
will
nigh
pass
belief
.
These
things
are
seldom
*NL*
proclaimed
at
home
;
they
happen
at
the
very
ends
of
the
earth
;
they
*NL*
are
done
in
a
corner
,
and
there
are
none
to
reveal
them
.
But
there
is
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
many
a
petty
trader
that
has
navigated
the
Pacific
whose
*NL*
course
from
island
to
island
might
be
traced
by
a
series
of
cold-blooded
*NL*
robberies
,
kidnappings
,
and
murders
,
the
iniquity
of
which
might
be
*NL*
considered
almost
sufficient
to
sink
her
guilty
timbers
to
the
bottom
of
*NL*
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
vague
accounts
of
such
thing
's
reach
our
firesides
,
and
*NL*
we
coolly
censure
them
as
wrong
,
impolitic
,
needlessly
severe
,
and
*NL*
dangerous
to
the
crews
of
other
vessels
.
How
different
is
our
tone
when
*NL*
we
read
the
highly-wrought
description
of
the
massacre
of
the
crew
of
*NL*
the
Hobomak
by
the
Feejees
;
how
we
sympathize
for
the
unhappy
victims
,
*NL*
and
with
what
horror
do
we
regard
the
diabolical
heathens
,
who
,
after
*NL*
all
,
have
but
avenged
the
unprovoked
injuries
which
they
have
received
.
*NL*
We
breathe
nothing
but
vengeance
,
and
equip
armed
vessels
to
traverse
*NL*
thousands
of
miles
of
ocean
in
order
to
execute
summary
punishment
upon
*NL*
the
offenders
.
On
arriving
at
their
destination
,
they
burn
,
slaughter
,
*NL*
and
destroy
,
according
to
the
tenor
of
written
instructions
,
and
sailing
*NL*
away
from
the
scene
of
devastation
,
call
upon
all
Christendom
to
applaud
*NL*
their
courage
and
their
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
often
is
the
term
`
savages
'
incorrectly
applied
!
None
really
*NL*
deserving
of
it
were
ever
yet
discovered
by
voyagers
or
by
travellers
.
*NL*
They
have
discovered
heathens
and
barbarians
whom
by
horrible
cruelties
*NL*
they
have
exasperated
into
savages
.
It
may
be
asserted
without
fear
*NL*
of
contradictions
that
in
all
the
cases
of
outrages
committed
by
*NL*
Polynesians
,
Europeans
have
at
some
time
or
other
been
the
aggressors
,
*NL*
and
that
the
cruel
and
bloodthirsty
disposition
of
some
of
the
islanders
*NL*
is
mainly
to
be
ascribed
to
the
influence
of
such
examples
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
.
Owing
to
the
mutual
hostilities
of
the
different
tribes
*NL*
I
have
mentioned
,
the
mountainous
tracts
which
separate
their
respective
*NL*
territories
remain
altogether
uninhabited
;
the
natives
invariably
*NL*
dwelling
in
the
depths
of
the
valleys
,
with
a
view
of
securing
*NL*
themselves
from
the
predatory
incursions
of
their
enemies
,
who
often
*NL*
lurk
along
their
borders
,
ready
to
cut
off
any
imprudent
straggler
,
*NL*
or
make
a
descent
upon
the
inmates
of
some
sequestered
habitation
.
I
*NL*
several
times
met
with
very
aged
men
,
who
from
this
cause
had
never
*NL*
passed
the
confines
of
their
native
vale
,
some
of
them
having
never
even
*NL*
ascended
midway
up
the
mountains
in
the
whole
course
of
their
lives
,
and
*NL*
who
,
accordingly
had
little
idea
of
the
appearance
of
any
other
part
of
*NL*
the
island
,
the
whole
of
which
is
not
perhaps
more
than
sixty
miles
in
*NL*
circuit
.
The
little
space
in
which
some
of
these
clans
pass
away
their
*NL*
days
would
seem
almost
incredible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
glen
of
the
Tior
will
furnish
a
curious
illustration
of
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inhabited
part
is
not
more
than
four
miles
in
length
,
and
varies
*NL*
in
breadth
from
half
a
mile
to
less
than
a
quarter
.
The
rocky
vine-clad
*NL*
cliffs
on
one
side
tower
almost
perpendicularly
from
their
base
to
*NL*
the
height
of
at
least
fifteen
hundred
feet
;
while
across
the
vale
--
in
*NL*
striking
contrast
to
the
scenery
opposite
--
grass-grown
elevations
rise
*NL*
one
above
another
in
blooming
terraces
.
Hemmed
in
by
these
stupendous
*NL*
barriers
,
the
valley
would
be
altogether
shut
out
from
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
world
,
were
it
not
that
it
is
accessible
from
the
sea
at
one
end
,
and
by
*NL*
a
narrow
defile
at
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
impression
produced
upon
the
mind
,
when
I
first
visited
this
*NL*
beautiful
glen
,
will
never
be
obliterated
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
come
from
Nukuheva
by
water
in
the
ship
's
boat
,
and
when
we
*NL*
entered
the
bay
of
Tior
it
was
high
noon
.
The
heat
had
been
intense
,
as
*NL*
we
had
been
floating
upon
the
long
smooth
swell
of
the
ocean
,
for
there
*NL*
was
but
little
wind
.
The
sun
's
rays
had
expended
all
their
fury
upon
us
;
*NL*
and
to
add
to
our
discomfort
,
we
had
omitted
to
supply
ourselves
with
*NL*
water
previous
to
starting
.
What
with
heat
and
thirst
together
,
I
became
*NL*
so
impatient
to
get
ashore
,
that
when
at
last
we
glided
towards
it
,
*NL*
I
stood
up
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
ready
for
a
spring
.
As
she
shot
*NL*
two-thirds
of
her
length
high
upon
the
beach
,
propelled
by
three
or
four
*NL*
strong
strokes
of
the
oars
,
I
leaped
among
a
parcel
of
juvenile
savages
,
*NL*
who
stood
prepared
to
give
us
a
kind
reception
;
and
with
them
at
my
*NL*
heels
,
yelling
like
so
many
imps
,
I
rushed
forward
across
the
open
*NL*
ground
in
the
vicinity
of
the
sea
,
and
plunged
,
diver
fashion
,
into
the
*NL*
recesses
of
the
first
grove
that
offered
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
delightful
sensation
did
I
experience
!
I
felt
as
if
floating
in
*NL*
some
new
element
,
while
all
sort
of
gurgling
,
trickling
,
liquid
sounds
*NL*
fell
upon
my
ear
.
People
may
say
what
they
will
about
the
refreshing
*NL*
influences
of
a
coldwater
bath
,
but
commend
me
when
in
a
perspiration
to
*NL*
the
shade
baths
of
Tior
,
beneath
the
cocoanut
trees
,
and
amidst
the
cool
*NL*
delightful
atmosphere
which
surrounds
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
shall
I
describe
the
scenery
that
met
my
eye
,
as
I
looked
out
*NL*
from
this
verdant
recess
!
The
narrow
valley
,
with
its
steep
and
close
*NL*
adjoining
sides
draperied
with
vines
,
and
arched
overhead
with
a
*NL*
fret-work
of
interlacing
boughs
,
nearly
hidden
from
view
by
masses
*NL*
of
leafy
verdure
,
seemed
from
where
I
stood
like
an
immense
arbour
*NL*
disclosing
its
vista
to
the
eye
,
whilst
as
I
advanced
it
insensibly
*NL*
widened
into
the
loveliest
vale
eye
ever
beheld
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
the
very
day
I
was
in
Tior
the
French
admiral
,
*NL*
attended
by
all
the
boats
of
his
squadron
,
came
down
in
state
from
*NL*
Nukuheva
to
take
formal
possession
of
the
place
.
He
remained
in
the
*NL*
valley
about
two
hours
,
during
which
time
he
had
a
ceremonious
interview
*NL*
with
the
king
.
The
patriarch-sovereign
of
Tior
was
a
man
very
far
*NL*
advanced
in
years
;
but
though
age
had
bowed
his
form
and
rendered
him
*NL*
almost
decrepid
,
his
gigantic
frame
retained
its
original
magnitude
and
*NL*
grandeur
of
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
advanced
slowly
and
with
evident
pain
,
assisting
his
tottering
steps
*NL*
with
the
heavy
warspear
he
held
in
his
hand
,
and
attended
by
a
group
of
*NL*
grey-bearded
chiefs
,
on
one
of
whom
he
occasionally
leaned
for
support
.
*NL*
The
admiral
came
forward
with
head
uncovered
and
extended
hand
,
while
*NL*
the
old
king
saluted
him
by
a
stately
flourish
of
his
weapon
.
The
*NL*
next
moment
they
stood
side
by
side
,
these
two
extremes
of
the
social
*NL*
scale
,
--
the
polished
,
splendid
Frenchman
,
and
the
poor
tattooed
savage
.
*NL*
They
were
both
tall
and
noble-looking
men
;
but
in
other
respects
how
*NL*
strikingly
contrasted
!
Du
Petit
Thouars
exhibited
upon
his
person
*NL*
all
the
paraphernalia
of
his
naval
rank
.
He
wore
a
richly
decorated
*NL*
admiral
's
frock-coat
,
a
laced
chapeau
bras
,
and
upon
his
breast
were
*NL*
a
variety
of
ribbons
and
orders
;
while
the
simple
islander
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
a
slight
cincture
about
his
loins
,
appeared
in
all
the
*NL*
nakedness
of
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
what
an
immeasurable
distance
,
thought
I
,
are
these
two
beings
*NL*
removed
from
each
other
.
In
the
one
is
shown
the
result
of
long
*NL*
centuries
of
progressive
Civilization
and
refinement
,
which
have
*NL*
gradually
converted
the
mere
creature
into
the
semblance
of
all
that
is
*NL*
elevated
and
grand
;
while
the
other
,
after
the
lapse
of
the
same
period
,
*NL*
has
not
advanced
one
step
in
the
career
of
improvement
,
`
Yet
,
after
*NL*
all
,
'
quoth
I
to
myself
,
`
insensible
as
he
is
to
a
thousand
wants
,
and
*NL*
removed
from
harassing
cares
,
may
not
the
savage
be
the
happier
man
of
*NL*
the
two
?
'
Such
were
the
thoughts
that
arose
in
my
mind
as
I
gazed
upon
*NL*
the
novel
spectacle
before
me
.
In
truth
it
was
an
impressive
one
,
*NL*
and
little
likely
to
be
effaced
.
I
can
recall
even
now
with
vivid
*NL*
distinctness
every
feature
of
the
scene
.
The
umbrageous
shades
where
*NL*
the
interview
took
place
--
the
glorious
tropical
vegetation
around
--
the
*NL*
picturesque
grouping
of
the
mingled
throng
of
soldiery
and
natives
--
and
*NL*
even
the
golden-hued
bunch
of
bananas
that
I
held
in
my
hand
at
the
*NL*
time
,
and
of
which
I
occasionally
partook
while
making
the
aforesaid
*NL*
philosophical
reflections
.

CHAPTER
FIVE
*NL*
*NL*
THOUGHTS
PREVIOUS
TO
ATTEMPTING
AN
ESCAPE
--
TOBY
,
A
FELLOW
SAILOR
,
AGREES
*NL*
TO
SHARE
THE
ADVENTURE
--
LAST
NIGHT
ABOARD
THE
SHIP
*NL*
*NL*
HAVING
fully
resolved
to
leave
the
vessel
clandestinely
,
and
having
*NL*
acquired
all
the
knowledge
concerning
the
bay
that
I
could
obtain
under
*NL*
the
circumstances
in
which
I
was
placed
,
I
now
deliberately
turned
over
*NL*
in
my
mind
every
plan
to
escape
that
suggested
itself
,
being
determined
*NL*
to
act
with
all
possible
prudence
in
an
attempt
where
failure
would
be
*NL*
attended
with
so
many
disagreeable
consequences
.
The
idea
of
being
*NL*
taken
and
brought
back
ignominiously
to
the
ship
was
so
inexpressibly
*NL*
repulsive
to
me
,
that
I
was
determined
by
no
hasty
and
imprudent
*NL*
measures
to
render
such
an
event
probable
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
that
our
worthy
captain
,
who
felt
,
such
a
paternal
solicitude
*NL*
for
the
welfare
of
his
crew
,
would
not
willingly
consent
that
one
of
his
*NL*
best
hands
should
encounter
the
perils
of
a
sojourn
among
the
natives
*NL*
of
a
barbarous
island
;
and
I
was
certain
that
in
the
event
of
my
*NL*
disappearance
,
his
fatherly
anxiety
would
prompt
him
to
offer
,
by
way
of
*NL*
a
reward
,
yard
upon
yard
of
gaily
printed
calico
for
my
apprehension
.
*NL*
He
might
even
have
appreciated
my
services
at
the
value
of
a
musket
,
in
*NL*
which
case
I
felt
perfectly
certain
that
the
whole
population
of
the
*NL*
bay
would
be
immediately
upon
my
track
,
incited
by
the
prospect
of
so
*NL*
magnificent
a
bounty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
ascertained
the
fact
before
alluded
to
,
that
the
islanders
,
--
from
*NL*
motives
of
precaution
,
dwelt
altogether
in
the
depths
of
the
valleys
,
*NL*
and
avoided
wandering
about
the
more
elevated
portions
of
the
shore
,
*NL*
unless
bound
on
some
expedition
of
war
or
plunder
,
I
concluded
that
if
*NL*
I
could
effect
unperceived
a
passage
to
the
mountain
,
I
might
easily
*NL*
remain
among
them
,
supporting
myself
by
such
fruits
as
came
in
my
way
*NL*
until
the
sailing
of
the
ship
,
an
event
of
which
I
could
not
fail
to
be
*NL*
immediately
apprised
,
as
from
my
lofty
position
I
should
command
a
view
*NL*
of
the
entire
harbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
pleased
me
greatly
.
It
seemed
to
combine
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
practicability
with
no
inconsiderable
enjoyment
in
a
quiet
way
;
for
how
*NL*
delightful
it
would
be
to
look
down
upon
the
detested
old
vessel
from
*NL*
the
height
of
some
thousand
feet
,
and
contrast
the
verdant
scenery
about
*NL*
me
with
the
recollection
of
her
narrow
decks
and
gloomy
forecastle
!
Why
,
*NL*
it
was
really
refreshing
even
to
think
of
it
;
and
so
I
straightway
fell
*NL*
to
picturing
myself
seated
beneath
a
cocoanut
tree
on
the
brow
of
the
*NL*
mountain
,
with
a
cluster
of
plantains
within
easy
reach
,
criticizing
her
*NL*
nautical
evolutions
as
she
was
working
her
way
out
of
the
harbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
there
was
one
rather
unpleasant
drawback
to
these
agreeable
*NL*
anticipations
--
the
possibility
of
falling
in
with
a
foraging
party
of
*NL*
these
same
bloody-minded
Typees
,
whose
appetites
,
edged
perhaps
by
the
*NL*
air
of
so
elevated
a
region
,
might
prompt
them
to
devour
one
.
This
,
I
*NL*
must
confess
,
was
a
most
disagreeable
view
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
to
think
of
a
party
of
these
unnatural
gourmands
taking
it
into
*NL*
their
heads
to
make
a
convivial
meal
of
a
poor
devil
,
who
would
have
*NL*
no
means
of
escape
or
defence
:
however
,
there
was
no
help
for
it
.
I
was
*NL*
willing
to
encounter
some
risks
in
order
to
accomplish
my
object
,
and
*NL*
counted
much
upon
my
ability
to
elude
these
prowling
cannibals
amongst
*NL*
the
many
coverts
which
the
mountains
afforded
.
Besides
,
the
chances
*NL*
were
ten
to
one
in
my
favour
that
they
would
none
of
them
quit
their
own
*NL*
fastnesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
determined
not
to
communicate
my
design
of
withdrawing
from
the
*NL*
vessel
to
any
of
my
shipmates
,
and
least
of
all
to
solicit
any
one
to
*NL*
accompany
me
in
my
flight
.
But
it
so
happened
one
night
,
that
being
upon
*NL*
deck
,
revolving
over
in
my
mind
various
plans
of
escape
,
I
perceived
one
*NL*
of
the
ship
's
company
leaning
over
the
bulwarks
,
apparently
plunged
in
a
*NL*
profound
reverie
.
He
was
a
young
fellow
about
my
own
age
,
for
whom
I
*NL*
had
all
along
entertained
a
great
regard
;
and
Toby
,
such
was
the
name
*NL*
by
which
he
went
among
us
,
for
his
real
name
he
would
never
tell
us
,
was
*NL*
every
way
worthy
of
it
.
He
was
active
,
ready
and
obliging
,
of
dauntless
*NL*
courage
,
and
singularly
open
and
fearless
in
the
expression
of
his
*NL*
feelings
.
I
had
on
more
than
one
occasion
got
him
out
of
scrapes
into
*NL*
which
this
had
led
him
;
and
I
know
not
whether
it
was
from
this
cause
,
*NL*
or
a
certain
congeniality
of
sentiment
between
us
,
that
he
had
always
*NL*
shown
a
partiality
for
my
society
.
We
had
battled
out
many
a
long
watch
*NL*
together
,
beguiling
the
weary
hours
with
chat
,
song
,
and
story
,
mingled
*NL*
with
a
good
many
imprecations
upon
the
hard
destiny
it
seemed
our
common
*NL*
fortune
to
encounter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
,
like
myself
,
had
evidently
moved
in
a
different
sphere
of
life
,
*NL*
and
his
conversation
at
times
betrayed
this
,
although
he
was
anxious
*NL*
to
conceal
it
.
He
was
one
of
that
class
of
rovers
you
sometimes
meet
*NL*
at
sea
,
who
never
reveal
their
origin
,
never
allude
to
home
,
and
go
*NL*
rambling
over
the
world
as
if
pursued
by
some
mysterious
fate
they
*NL*
can
not
possibly
elude
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
much
even
in
the
appearance
of
Toby
calculated
to
draw
me
*NL*
towards
him
,
for
while
the
greater
part
of
the
crew
were
as
coarse
in
*NL*
person
as
in
mind
,
Toby
was
endowed
with
a
remarkably
prepossessing
*NL*
exterior
.
Arrayed
in
his
blue
frock
and
duck
trousers
,
he
was
as
smart
a
*NL*
looking
sailor
as
ever
stepped
upon
a
deck
;
he
was
singularly
small
*NL*
and
slightly
made
,
with
great
flexibility
of
limb
.
His
naturally
dark
*NL*
complexion
had
been
deepened
by
exposure
to
the
tropical
sun
,
and
a
mass
*NL*
of
jetty
locks
clustered
about
his
temples
,
and
threw
a
darker
shade
*NL*
into
his
large
black
eyes
.
He
was
a
strange
wayward
being
,
moody
,
*NL*
fitful
,
and
melancholy
--
at
times
almost
morose
.
He
had
a
quick
and
fiery
*NL*
temper
too
,
which
,
when
thoroughly
roused
,
transported
him
into
a
state
*NL*
bordering
on
delirium
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
strange
the
power
that
a
mind
of
deep
passion
has
over
feebler
*NL*
natures
.
I
have
seen
a
brawny
,
fellow
,
with
no
lack
of
ordinary
courage
,
*NL*
fairly
quail
before
this
slender
stripling
,
when
in
one
of
his
curious
*NL*
fits
.
But
these
paroxysms
seldom
occurred
,
and
in
them
my
big-hearted
*NL*
shipmate
vented
the
bile
which
more
calm-tempered
individuals
get
rid
of
*NL*
by
a
continual
pettishness
at
trivial
annoyances
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
ever
saw
Toby
laugh
.
I
mean
in
the
hearty
abandonment
of
*NL*
broad-mouthed
mirth
.
He
did
smile
sometimes
,
it
is
true
;
and
there
was
*NL*
a
good
deal
of
dry
,
sarcastic
humour
about
him
,
which
told
the
more
from
*NL*
the
imperturbable
gravity
of
his
tone
and
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Latterly
I
had
observed
that
Toby
's
melancholy
had
greatly
increased
,
*NL*
and
I
had
frequently
seen
him
since
our
arrival
at
the
island
gazing
*NL*
wistfully
upon
the
shore
,
when
the
remainder
of
the
crew
would
be
*NL*
rioting
below
.
I
was
aware
that
he
entertained
a
cordial
detestation
*NL*
of
the
ship
,
and
believed
that
,
should
a
fair
chance
of
escape
present
*NL*
itself
,
he
would
embrace
it
willingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
attempt
was
so
perilous
in
the
place
where
we
then
lay
,
that
*NL*
I
supposed
myself
the
only
individual
on
board
the
ship
who
was
*NL*
sufficiently
reckless
to
think
of
it
.
In
this
,
however
,
I
was
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
perceived
Toby
leaning
,
as
I
have
mentioned
,
against
the
bulwarks
*NL*
and
buried
in
thought
,
it
struck
me
at
once
that
the
subject
of
his
*NL*
meditations
might
be
the
same
as
my
own
.
And
if
it
be
so
,
thought
I
,
*NL*
is
he
not
the
very
one
of
all
my
shipmates
whom
I
would
choose
:
for
the
*NL*
partner
of
my
adventure
?
and
why
should
I
not
have
some
comrade
with
me
*NL*
to
divide
its
dangers
and
alleviate
its
hardships
?
Perhaps
I
might
be
*NL*
obliged
to
lie
concealed
among
the
mountains
for
weeks
.
In
such
an
event
*NL*
what
a
solace
would
a
companion
be
?
*NL*
*NL*
These
thoughts
passed
rapidly
through
my
mind
,
and
I
wondered
why
I
had
*NL*
not
before
considered
the
matter
in
this
light
.
But
it
was
not
too
late
.
*NL*
A
tap
upon
the
shoulder
served
to
rouse
Toby
from
his
reverie
;
I
found
*NL*
him
ripe
for
the
enterprise
,
and
a
very
few
words
sufficed
for
a
mutual
*NL*
understanding
between
us
.
In
an
hour
's
time
we
had
arranged
all
the
*NL*
preliminaries
,
and
decided
upon
our
plan
of
action
.
We
then
ratified
our
*NL*
engagement
with
an
affectionate
wedding
of
palms
,
and
to
elude
suspicion
*NL*
repaired
each
to
his
hammock
,
to
spend
the
last
night
on
board
the
*NL*
Dolly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
the
starboard
watch
,
to
which
we
both
belonged
,
was
to
be
*NL*
sent
ashore
on
liberty
;
and
,
availing
ourselves
of
this
opportunity
,
*NL*
we
determined
,
as
soon
after
landing
as
possible
,
to
separate
ourselves
*NL*
from
the
rest
of
the
men
without
exciting
their
suspicions
,
and
strike
*NL*
back
at
once
for
the
mountains
.
Seen
from
the
ship
,
their
summits
*NL*
appeared
inaccessible
,
but
here
and
there
sloping
spurs
extended
from
*NL*
them
almost
into
the
sea
,
buttressing
the
lofty
elevations
with
which
*NL*
they
were
connected
,
and
forming
those
radiating
valleys
I
have
before
*NL*
described
.
One
of
these
ridges
,
which
appeared
more
practicable
than
the
*NL*
rest
,
we
determined
to
climb
,
convinced
that
it
would
conduct
us
to
*NL*
the
heights
beyond
.
Accordingly
,
we
carefully
observed
its
bearings
and
*NL*
locality
from
the
ship
,
so
that
when
ashore
we
should
run
no
chance
of
*NL*
missing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
this
the
leading
object
we
had
in
view
was
to
seclude
ourselves
*NL*
from
sight
until
the
departure
of
the
vessel
;
then
to
take
our
chance
as
*NL*
to
the
reception
the
Nukuheva
natives
might
give
us
;
and
after
remaining
*NL*
upon
the
island
as
long
as
we
found
our
stay
agreeable
,
to
leave
it
the
*NL*
first
favourable
opportunity
that
offered
.

CHAPTER
SIX
*NL*
*NL*
A
SPECIMEN
OF
NAUTICAL
ORATORY
--
CRITICISMS
OF
THE
SAILORS
--
THE
STARBOARD
*NL*
WATCH
ARE
GIVEN
A
HOLIDAY
--
THE
ESCAPE
TO
THE
MOUNTAINS
*NL*
*NL*
EARLY
the
next
morning
the
starboard
watch
were
mustered
upon
the
*NL*
quarter-deck
,
and
our
worthy
captain
,
standing
in
the
cabin
gangway
,
*NL*
harangued
us
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
men
,
as
we
are
just
off
a
six
months
'
cruise
,
and
have
got
through
*NL*
most
all
our
work
in
port
here
,
I
suppose
you
want
to
go
ashore
.
Well
,
I
*NL*
mean
to
give
your
watch
liberty
today
,
so
you
may
get
ready
as
soon
all
*NL*
you
please
,
and
go
;
but
understand
this
,
I
am
going
to
give
you
liberty
*NL*
because
I
suppose
you
would
growl
like
so
many
old
quarter
gunners
if
I
*NL*
did
n't
;
at
the
same
time
,
if
you
'll
take
my
advice
,
every
mother
's
son
*NL*
of
you
will
stay
aboard
and
keep
out
of
the
way
of
the
bloody
cannibals
*NL*
altogether
.
Ten
to
one
,
men
,
if
you
go
ashore
,
you
will
get
into
some
*NL*
infernal
row
,
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
you
;
for
if
those
tattooed
*NL*
scoundrels
get
you
a
little
ways
back
into
their
valleys
,
they
'll
nab
*NL*
you
--
that
you
may
be
certain
of
.
Plenty
of
white
men
have
gone
ashore
*NL*
here
and
never
been
seen
any
more
.
There
was
the
old
Dido
,
she
put
in
*NL*
here
about
two
years
ago
,
and
sent
one
watch
off
on
liberty
;
they
never
*NL*
were
heard
of
again
for
a
week
--
the
natives
swore
they
did
n't
know
where
*NL*
they
were
--
and
only
three
of
them
ever
got
back
to
the
ship
again
,
and
*NL*
one
with
his
face
damaged
for
life
,
for
the
cursed
heathens
tattooed
a
*NL*
broad
patch
clean
across
his
figure-head
.
But
it
will
be
no
use
talking
*NL*
to
you
,
for
go
you
will
,
that
I
see
plainly
;
so
all
I
have
to
say
is
,
*NL*
that
you
need
not
blame
me
if
the
islanders
make
a
meal
of
you
.
You
may
*NL*
stand
some
chance
of
escaping
them
though
,
if
you
keep
close
about
the
*NL*
French
encampment
,
--
and
are
back
to
the
ship
again
before
sunset
.
Keep
*NL*
that
much
in
your
mind
,
if
you
forget
all
the
rest
I
've
been
saying
to
*NL*
you
.
There
,
go
forward
:
bear
a
hand
and
rig
yourselves
,
and
stand
by
for
*NL*
a
call
.
At
two
bells
the
boat
will
be
manned
to
take
you
off
,
and
the
*NL*
Lord
have
mercy
on
you
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Various
were
the
emotions
depicted
upon
the
countenances
of
the
*NL*
starboard
watch
whilst
listening
to
this
address
;
but
on
its
conclusion
*NL*
there
was
a
general
move
towards
the
forecastle
,
and
we
soon
were
*NL*
all
busily
engaged
in
getting
ready
for
the
holiday
so
auspiciously
*NL*
announced
by
the
skipper
.
During
these
preparations
his
harangue
was
*NL*
commented
upon
in
no
very
measured
terms
;
and
one
of
the
party
,
after
*NL*
denouncing
him
as
a
lying
old
son
of
a
seacook
who
begrudged
a
fellow
a
*NL*
few
hours
'
liberty
,
exclaimed
with
an
oath
,
`
But
you
do
n't
bounce
me
out
*NL*
of
my
liberty
,
old
chap
,
for
all
your
yarns
;
for
I
would
go
ashore
if
*NL*
every
pebble
on
the
beach
was
a
live
coal
,
and
every
stick
a
gridiron
,
*NL*
and
the
cannibals
stood
ready
to
broil
me
on
landing
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirit
of
this
sentiment
was
responded
to
by
all
hands
,
and
we
*NL*
resolved
that
in
spite
of
the
captain
's
croakings
we
would
make
a
*NL*
glorious
day
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Toby
and
I
had
our
own
game
to
play
,
and
we
availed
ourselves
of
*NL*
the
confusion
which
always
reigns
among
a
ship
's
company
preparatory
to
*NL*
going
ashore
,
to
confer
together
and
complete
our
arrangements
.
As
our
*NL*
object
was
to
effect
as
rapid
a
flight
as
possible
to
the
mountains
,
we
*NL*
determined
not
to
encumber
ourselves
with
any
superfluous
apparel
;
and
*NL*
accordingly
,
while
the
rest
were
rigging
themselves
out
with
some
idea
*NL*
of
making
a
display
,
we
were
content
to
put
on
new
stout
duck
trousers
,
*NL*
serviceable
pumps
,
and
heavy
Havre-frocks
,
which
with
a
Payta
hat
*NL*
completed
our
equipment
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
our
shipmates
wondered
at
this
,
Toby
exclaimed
in
his
odd
grave
way
*NL*
that
the
rest
might
do
,
as
they
liked
,
but
that
he
for
one
preserved
*NL*
his
go-ashore
traps
for
the
Spanish
main
,
where
the
tie
of
a
sailor
's
*NL*
neckerchief
might
make
some
difference
;
but
as
for
a
parcel
of
*NL*
unbreeched
heathen
,
he
would
n't
go
to
the
bottom
of
his
chest
for
any
*NL*
of
them
,
and
was
half
disposed
to
appear
among
them
in
buff
himself
.
The
*NL*
men
laughed
at
what
they
thought
was
one
of
his
strange
conceits
,
and
so
*NL*
we
escaped
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
appear
singular
that
we
should
have
been
thus
on
our
guard
with
*NL*
our
own
shipmates
;
but
there
were
some
among
us
who
,
had
they
possessed
*NL*
the
least
inkling
of
our
project
,
would
,
for
a
paltry
hope
of
reward
,
*NL*
have
immediately
communicated
it
to
the
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
two
bells
were
struck
,
the
word
was
passed
for
the
*NL*
liberty-men
to
get
into
the
boat
.
I
lingered
behind
in
the
forecastle
a
*NL*
moment
to
take
a
parting
glance
at
its
familiar
features
,
and
just
as
*NL*
I
was
about
to
ascend
to
the
deck
my
eye
happened
to
light
on
the
*NL*
bread-barge
and
beef-kid
,
which
contained
the
remnants
of
our
last
hasty
*NL*
meal
.
Although
I
had
never
before
thought
of
providing
anything
in
the
*NL*
way
of
food
for
our
expedition
,
as
I
fully
relied
upon
the
fruits
of
the
*NL*
island
to
sustain
us
wherever
we
might
wander
,
yet
I
could
not
resist
*NL*
the
inclination
I
felt
to
provide
luncheon
from
the
relics
before
me
.
*NL*
Accordingly
I
took
a
double
handful
of
those
small
,
broken
,
flinty
bits
*NL*
of
biscuit
which
generally
go
by
the
name
of
`
midshipmen
's
nuts
'
,
and
*NL*
thrust
them
into
the
bosom
of
my
frock
in
which
same
simple
receptacle
I
*NL*
had
previously
stowed
away
several
pounds
of
tobacco
and
a
few
yards
of
*NL*
cotton
cloth
--
articles
with
which
I
intended
to
purchase
the
good-will
*NL*
of
the
natives
,
as
soon
as
we
should
appear
among
them
after
the
*NL*
departure
of
our
vessel
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
last
addition
to
my
stock
caused
a
considerable
protuberance
in
*NL*
front
,
which
I
abated
in
a
measure
by
shaking
the
bits
of
bread
around
*NL*
my
waist
,
and
distributing
the
plugs
of
tobacco
among
the
folds
of
the
*NL*
garment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
I
completed
these
arrangements
when
my
name
was
sung
out
by
a
*NL*
dozen
voices
,
and
I
sprung
upon
the
deck
,
where
I
found
all
the
party
in
*NL*
the
boat
,
and
impatient
to
shove
off
.
I
dropped
over
the
side
and
seated
*NL*
myself
with
the
rest
of
the
watch
in
the
stern
sheets
,
while
the
poor
*NL*
larboarders
shipped
their
oars
,
and
commenced
pulling
us
ashore
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
happened
to
be
the
rainy
season
at
the
islands
,
and
the
heavens
*NL*
had
nearly
the
whole
morning
betokened
one
of
those
heavy
showers
which
*NL*
during
this
period
so
frequently
occur
.
The
large
drops
fell
bubbling
*NL*
into
the
water
shortly
after
our
leaving
the
ship
,
and
by
the
time
we
*NL*
had
affected
a
landing
it
poured
down
in
torrents
.
We
fled
for
shelter
*NL*
under
cover
of
an
immense
canoe-house
which
stood
hard
by
the
beach
,
and
*NL*
waited
for
the
first
fury
of
the
storm
to
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
continued
,
however
,
without
cessation
;
and
the
monotonous
beating
of
*NL*
the
rain
over
head
began
to
exert
a
drowsy
influence
upon
the
men
,
who
,
*NL*
throwing
themselves
here
and
there
upon
the
large
war-canoes
,
after
*NL*
chatting
awhile
,
all
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
opportunity
we
desired
,
and
Toby
and
I
availed
ourselves
*NL*
of
it
at
once
by
stealing
out
of
the
canoe-house
and
plunging
into
the
*NL*
depths
of
an
extensive
grove
that
was
in
its
rear
.
After
ten
minutes
'
*NL*
rapid
progress
we
gained
an
open
space
from
which
we
could
just
descry
*NL*
the
ridge
we
intended
to
mount
looming
dimly
through
the
mists
of
the
*NL*
tropical
shower
,
and
distant
from
us
,
as
we
estimated
,
something
more
*NL*
than
a
mile
.
Our
direct
course
towards
it
lay
through
a
rather
populous
*NL*
part
of
the
bay
;
but
desirous
as
we
were
of
evading
the
natives
and
*NL*
securing
an
unmolested
retreat
to
the
mountains
,
we
determined
,
by
*NL*
taking
a
circuit
through
some
extensive
thickets
,
to
avoid
their
*NL*
vicinity
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heavy
rain
that
still
continued
to
fall
without
intermission
*NL*
favoured
our
enterprise
,
as
it
drove
the
islanders
into
their
houses
,
*NL*
and
prevented
any
casual
meeting
with
them
.
Our
heavy
frocks
soon
became
*NL*
completely
saturated
with
water
,
and
by
their
weight
,
and
that
of
*NL*
the
articles
we
had
concealed
beneath
them
,
not
a
little
impeded
our
*NL*
progress
.
But
it
was
no
time
to
pause
when
at
any
moment
we
might
be
*NL*
surprised
by
a
body
of
the
savages
,
and
forced
at
the
very
outset
to
*NL*
relinquish
our
undertaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
leaving
the
canoe-house
we
had
scarcely
exchanged
a
single
*NL*
syllable
with
one
another
;
but
when
we
entered
a
second
narrow
opening
*NL*
in
the
wood
,
and
again
caught
sight
of
the
ridge
before
us
,
I
took
Toby
*NL*
by
the
arm
,
and
pointing
along
its
sloping
outline
to
the
lofty
heights
*NL*
at
its
extremity
,
said
in
a
low
tone
,
`
Now
,
Toby
,
not
a
word
,
nor
a
*NL*
glance
backward
,
till
we
stand
on
the
summit
of
yonder
mountain
--
so
no
*NL*
more
lingering
but
let
us
shove
ahead
while
we
can
,
and
in
a
few
hours
'
*NL*
time
we
may
laugh
aloud
.
You
are
the
lightest
and
the
nimblest
,
so
lead
*NL*
on
,
and
I
will
follow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
right
,
brother
,
'
said
Toby
,
`
quick
's
our
play
;
only
lets
keep
close
*NL*
together
,
that
's
all
;
'
and
so
saying
with
a
bound
like
a
young
roe
,
he
*NL*
cleared
a
brook
which
ran
across
our
path
,
and
rushed
forward
with
a
*NL*
quick
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
arrived
within
a
short
distance
of
the
ridge
,
we
were
stopped
by
*NL*
a
mass
of
tall
yellow
reeds
,
growing
together
as
thickly
as
they
could
*NL*
stand
,
and
as
tough
and
stubborn
as
so
many
rods
of
steel
;
and
we
*NL*
perceived
,
to
our
chagrin
,
that
they
extended
midway
up
the
elevation
we
*NL*
proposed
to
ascend
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
we
gazed
about
us
in
quest
of
a
more
practicable
route
;
it
*NL*
was
,
however
,
at
once
apparent
that
there
was
no
resource
but
to
pierce
*NL*
this
thicket
of
canes
at
all
hazards
.
We
now
reversed
our
order
of
*NL*
march
,
I
,
being
the
heaviest
,
taking
the
lead
,
with
a
view
of
breaking
a
*NL*
path
through
the
obstruction
,
while
Toby
fell
into
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
or
three
times
I
endeavoured
to
insinuate
myself
between
the
canes
,
*NL*
and
by
dint
of
coaxing
and
bending
them
to
make
some
progress
;
but
a
*NL*
bull-frog
might
as
well
have
tried
to
work
a
passage
through
the
teeth
*NL*
of
a
comb
,
and
I
gave
up
the
attempt
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
wild
with
meeting
an
obstacle
we
had
so
little
anticipated
,
I
threw
*NL*
myself
desperately
against
it
,
crushing
to
the
ground
the
canes
with
*NL*
which
I
came
in
contact
,
and
,
rising
to
my
feet
again
,
repeated
the
*NL*
action
with
like
effect
.
Twenty
minutes
of
this
violent
exercise
almost
*NL*
exhausted
me
,
but
it
carried
us
some
way
into
the
thicket
;
when
Toby
,
*NL*
who
had
been
reaping
the
benefit
of
my
labours
by
following
close
at
my
*NL*
heels
,
proposed
to
become
pioneer
in
turn
,
and
accordingly
passed
ahead
*NL*
with
a
view
of
affording
me
a
respite
from
my
exertions
.
As
however
*NL*
with
his
slight
frame
he
made
but
bad
work
of
it
,
I
was
soon
obliged
to
*NL*
resume
my
old
place
again
.
On
we
toiled
,
the
perspiration
starting
from
*NL*
our
bodies
in
floods
,
our
limbs
torn
and
lacerated
with
the
splintered
*NL*
fragments
of
the
broken
canes
,
until
we
had
proceeded
perhaps
as
far
*NL*
as
the
middle
of
the
brake
,
when
suddenly
it
ceased
raining
,
and
the
*NL*
atmosphere
around
us
became
close
and
sultry
beyond
expression
.
The
*NL*
elasticity
of
the
reeds
quickly
recovering
from
the
temporary
pressure
*NL*
of
our
bodies
,
caused
them
to
spring
back
to
their
original
position
;
*NL*
so
that
they
closed
in
upon
us
as
we
advanced
,
and
prevented
the
*NL*
circulation
of
little
air
which
might
otherwise
have
reached
us
.
*NL*
Besides
this
,
their
great
height
completely
shut
us
out
from
the
view
of
*NL*
surrounding
objects
,
and
we
were
not
certain
but
that
we
might
have
been
*NL*
going
all
the
time
in
a
wrong
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fatigued
with
my
long-continued
efforts
,
and
panting
for
breath
,
I
felt
*NL*
myself
completely
incapacitated
for
any
further
exertion
.
I
rolled
up
*NL*
the
sleeve
of
my
frock
,
and
squeezed
the
moisture
it
contained
into
*NL*
my
parched
mouth
.
But
the
few
drops
I
managed
to
obtain
gave
me
little
*NL*
relief
,
and
I
sank
down
for
a
moment
with
a
sort
of
dogged
apathy
,
from
*NL*
which
I
was
aroused
by
Toby
,
who
had
devised
a
plan
to
free
us
from
the
*NL*
net
in
which
we
had
become
entangled
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
laying
about
him
lustily
with
his
sheath-knive
,
lopping
the
canes
*NL*
right
and
left
,
like
a
reaper
,
and
soon
made
quite
a
clearing
around
us
.
*NL*
This
sight
reanimated
me
;
and
seizing
my
own
knife
,
I
hacked
and
hewed
*NL*
away
without
mercy
.
But
alas
!
the
farther
we
advanced
the
thicker
and
*NL*
taller
,
and
apparently
the
more
interminable
,
the
reeds
became
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
began
to
think
we
were
fairly
snared
,
and
had
almost
made
up
my
mind
*NL*
that
without
a
pair
of
wings
we
should
never
be
able
to
escape
from
the
*NL*
toils
;
when
all
at
once
I
discerned
a
peep
of
daylight
through
the
canes
*NL*
on
my
right
,
and
,
communicating
the
joyful
tidings
to
Toby
,
we
both
fell
*NL*
to
with
fresh
spirit
,
and
speedily
opening
the
passage
towards
it
we
*NL*
found
ourselves
clear
of
perplexities
,
and
in
the
near
vicinity
of
the
*NL*
ridge
.
After
resting
for
a
few
moments
we
began
the
ascent
,
and
after
*NL*
a
little
vigorous
climbing
found
ourselves
close
to
its
summit
.
Instead
*NL*
however
of
walking
along
its
ridge
,
where
we
should
have
been
in
full
*NL*
view
of
the
natives
in
the
vales
beneath
,
and
at
a
point
where
they
*NL*
could
easily
intercept
us
were
they
so
inclined
,
we
cautiously
advanced
*NL*
on
one
side
,
crawling
on
our
hands
and
knees
,
and
screened
from
*NL*
observation
by
the
grass
through
which
we
glided
,
much
in
the
fashion
of
*NL*
a
couple
of
serpents
.
After
an
hour
employed
in
this
unpleasant
kind
*NL*
of
locomotion
,
we
started
to
our
feet
again
and
pursued
our
way
boldly
*NL*
along
the
crest
of
the
ridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
salient
spur
of
the
lofty
elevations
that
encompassed
the
bay
rose
*NL*
with
a
sharp
angle
from
the
valleys
at
its
base
,
and
presented
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
a
few
steep
acclivities
,
the
appearance
of
a
vast
inclined
*NL*
plane
,
sweeping
down
towards
the
sea
from
the
heights
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
We
had
ascended
it
near
the
place
of
its
termination
and
at
its
lowest
*NL*
point
,
and
now
saw
our
route
to
the
mountains
distinctly
defined
along
*NL*
its
narrow
crest
,
which
was
covered
with
a
soft
carpet
of
verdure
,
and
*NL*
was
in
many
parts
only
a
few
feet
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Elated
with
the
success
which
had
so
far
attended
our
enterprise
,
and
*NL*
invigorated
by
the
refreshing
atmosphere
we
now
inhaled
,
Toby
and
I
in
*NL*
high
spirits
were
making
our
way
rapidly
along
the
ridge
,
when
suddenly
*NL*
from
the
valleys
below
which
lay
on
either
side
of
us
we
heard
the
*NL*
distant
shouts
of
the
natives
,
who
had
just
descried
us
,
and
to
whom
our
*NL*
figures
,
brought
in
bold
relief
against
the
sky
,
were
plainly
revealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Glancing
our
eyes
into
these
valleys
,
we
perceived
their
savage
*NL*
inhabitants
hurrying
to
and
fro
,
seemingly
under
the
influence
of
some
*NL*
sudden
alarm
,
and
appearing
to
the
eye
scarcely
bigger
than
so
many
*NL*
pigmies
;
while
their
white
thatched
dwellings
,
dwarfed
by
the
distance
,
*NL*
looked
like
baby-houses
.
As
we
looked
down
upon
the
islanders
from
our
*NL*
lofty
elevation
,
we
experienced
a
sense
of
security
;
feeling
confident
*NL*
that
,
should
they
undertake
a
pursuit
,
it
would
,
from
the
start
we
*NL*
now
had
,
prove
entirely
fruitless
,
unless
they
followed
us
into
the
*NL*
mountains
,
where
we
knew
they
cared
not
to
venture
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
we
thought
it
as
well
to
make
the
most
of
our
time
;
and
*NL*
accordingly
,
where
the
ground
would
admit
of
it
,
we
ran
swiftly
along
*NL*
the
summit
of
the
ridge
,
until
we
were
brought
to
a
stand
by
a
steep
*NL*
cliff
,
which
at
first
seemed
to
interpose
an
effectual
barrier
to
our
*NL*
farther
advance
.
By
dint
of
much
hard
scrambling
however
,
and
at
some
*NL*
risk
to
our
necks
,
we
at
last
surmounted
it
,
and
continued
our
fight
*NL*
with
unabated
celerity
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
left
the
beach
early
in
the
morning
,
and
after
an
uninterrupted
,
*NL*
though
at
times
difficult
and
dangerous
ascent
,
during
which
we
had
*NL*
never
once
turned
our
faces
to
the
sea
,
we
found
ourselves
,
about
*NL*
three
hours
before
sunset
,
standing
on
the
top
of
what
seemed
to
be
the
*NL*
highest
land
on
the
island
,
an
immense
overhanging
cliff
composed
of
*NL*
basaltic
rocks
,
hung
round
with
parasitical
plants
.
We
must
have
been
*NL*
more
than
three
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
,
and
the
*NL*
scenery
viewed
from
this
height
was
magnificent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lonely
bay
of
Nukuheva
,
dotted
here
and
there
with
the
black
hulls
*NL*
of
the
vessels
composing
the
French
squadron
,
lay
reposing
at
the
base
*NL*
of
a
circular
range
of
elevations
,
whose
verdant
sides
,
perforated
with
*NL*
deep
glens
or
diversified
with
smiling
valleys
,
formed
altogether
the
*NL*
loveliest
view
I
ever
beheld
,
and
were
I
to
live
a
hundred
years
,
I
*NL*
shall
never
forget
the
feeling
of
admiration
which
I
then
experienced
.

LANDSCAPE
*NL*
*NL*
MY
curiosity
had
been
not
a
little
raised
with
regard
to
the
description
*NL*
of
country
we
should
meet
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountains
;
and
I
had
*NL*
supposed
,
with
Toby
,
that
immediately
on
gaining
the
heights
we
should
*NL*
be
enabled
to
view
the
large
bays
of
Happar
and
Typee
reposing
at
our
*NL*
feet
on
one
side
,
in
the
same
way
that
Nukuheva
lay
spread
out
below
*NL*
on
the
other
.
But
here
we
were
disappointed
.
Instead
of
finding
the
*NL*
mountain
we
had
ascended
sweeping
down
in
the
opposite
direction
into
*NL*
broad
and
capacious
valleys
,
the
land
appeared
to
retain
its
general
*NL*
elevation
,
only
broken
into
a
series
of
ridges
and
inter-vales
which
*NL*
so
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
stretched
away
from
us
,
with
their
*NL*
precipitous
sides
covered
with
the
brightest
verdure
,
and
waving
here
*NL*
and
there
with
the
foliage
of
clumps
of
woodland
;
among
which
,
however
,
*NL*
we
perceived
none
of
those
trees
upon
whose
fruit
we
had
relied
with
*NL*
such
certainty
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
most
unlooked-for
discovery
,
and
one
that
promised
to
defeat
*NL*
our
plans
altogether
,
for
we
could
not
think
of
descending
the
mountain
*NL*
on
the
Nukuheva
side
in
quest
of
food
.
Should
we
for
this
purpose
*NL*
be
induced
to
retrace
our
steps
,
we
should
run
no
small
chance
of
*NL*
encountering
the
natives
,
who
in
that
case
,
if
they
did
nothing
worse
to
*NL*
us
,
would
be
certain
to
convey
us
back
to
the
ship
for
the
sake
of
the
*NL*
reward
in
calico
and
trinkets
,
which
we
had
no
doubt
our
skipper
would
*NL*
hold
out
to
them
as
an
inducement
to
our
capture
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
to
be
done
?
The
Dolly
would
not
sail
perhaps
for
ten
days
,
and
*NL*
how
were
we
to
sustain
life
during
this
period
?
I
bitterly
repented
our
*NL*
improvidence
in
not
providing
ourselves
,
as
we
easily
might
have
done
,
*NL*
with
a
supply
of
biscuits
.
With
a
rueful
visage
I
now
bethought
me
of
*NL*
the
scanty
handful
of
bread
I
had
stuffed
into
the
bosom
of
my
frock
,
*NL*
and
felt
somewhat
desirous
to
ascertain
what
part
of
it
had
weathered
*NL*
the
rather
rough
usage
it
had
experienced
in
ascending
the
mountain
.
*NL*
I
accordingly
proposed
to
Toby
that
we
should
enter
into
a
joint
*NL*
examination
of
the
various
articles
we
had
brought
from
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
intent
we
seated
ourselves
upon
the
grass
;
and
a
little
*NL*
curious
to
see
with
what
kind
of
judgement
my
companion
had
filled
*NL*
his
frock
--
which
I
remarked
seemed
about
as
well
lined
as
my
own
--
I
*NL*
requested
him
to
commence
operations
by
spreading
out
its
contents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thrusting
his
hand
,
then
,
into
the
bosom
of
this
capacious
receptacle
,
*NL*
he
first
brought
to
light
about
a
pound
of
tobacco
,
whose
component
*NL*
parts
still
adhered
together
,
the
whole
outside
being
covered
with
*NL*
soft
particles
of
sea-bread
.
Wet
and
dripping
,
it
had
the
appearance
of
*NL*
having
been
just
recovered
from
the
bottom
of
the
sea
.
But
I
paid
*NL*
slight
attention
to
a
substance
of
so
little
value
to
us
in
our
present
*NL*
situation
,
as
soon
as
I
perceived
the
indications
it
gave
of
Toby
's
*NL*
foresight
in
laying
in
a
supply
of
food
for
the
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
eagerly
inquired
what
quantity
he
had
brought
with
him
,
when
rummaging
*NL*
once
more
beneath
his
garment
,
he
produced
a
small
handful
of
something
*NL*
so
soft
,
pulpy
,
and
discoloured
,
that
for
a
few
moments
he
was
as
*NL*
much
puzzled
as
myself
to
tell
by
what
possible
instrumentality
such
*NL*
a
villainous
compound
had
become
engendered
in
his
bosom
.
I
can
only
*NL*
describe
it
as
a
hash
of
soaked
bread
and
bits
of
tobacco
,
brought
to
*NL*
a
doughy
consistency
by
the
united
agency
of
perspiration
and
rain
.
*NL*
But
repulsive
as
it
might
otherwise
have
been
,
I
now
regarded
it
as
*NL*
an
invaluable
treasure
,
and
proceeded
with
great
care
to
transfer
this
*NL*
paste-like
mass
to
a
large
leaf
which
I
had
plucked
from
a
bush
beside
*NL*
me
.
Toby
informed
me
that
in
the
morning
he
had
placed
two
whole
*NL*
biscuits
in
his
bosom
,
with
a
view
of
munching
them
,
should
he
feel
so
*NL*
inclined
,
during
our
flight
.
These
were
now
reduced
to
the
equivocal
*NL*
substance
which
I
had
just
placed
on
the
leaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
dive
into
the
frock
brought
to
view
some
four
or
five
yards
of
*NL*
calico
print
,
whose
tasteful
pattern
was
rather
disfigured
by
the
yellow
*NL*
stains
of
the
tobacco
with
which
it
had
been
brought
in
contact
.
In
*NL*
drawing
this
calico
slowly
from
his
bosom
inch
by
inch
,
Toby
reminded
*NL*
me
of
a
juggler
performing
the
feat
of
the
endless
ribbon
.
The
next
*NL*
cast
was
a
small
one
,
being
a
sailor
's
little
`
ditty
bag
'
,
containing
*NL*
needles
,
thread
,
and
other
sewing
utensils
,
then
came
a
razor-case
,
*NL*
followed
by
two
or
three
separate
plugs
of
negro-head
,
which
were
fished
*NL*
up
from
the
bottom
of
the
now
empty
receptacle
.
These
various
matters
,
*NL*
being
inspected
,
I
produced
the
few
things
which
I
had
myself
brought
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
might
have
been
anticipated
from
the
state
of
my
companion
's
edible
*NL*
supplies
,
I
found
my
own
in
a
deplorable
condition
,
and
diminished
to
a
*NL*
quantity
that
would
not
have
formed
half
a
dozen
mouthfuls
for
a
hungry
*NL*
man
who
was
partial
enough
to
tobacco
not
to
mind
swallowing
it
.
A
*NL*
few
morsels
of
bread
,
with
a
fathom
or
two
of
white
cotton
cloth
,
and
*NL*
several
pounds
of
choice
pigtail
,
composed
the
extent
of
my
possessions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
joint
stock
of
miscellaneous
articles
were
now
made
up
into
a
*NL*
compact
bundle
,
which
it
was
agreed
we
should
carry
alternately
.
But
the
*NL*
sorry
remains
of
the
biscuit
were
not
to
be
disposed
of
so
summarily
:
*NL*
the
precarious
circumstances
in
which
we
were
placed
made
us
regard
them
*NL*
as
something
on
which
very
probably
,
depended
the
fate
of
our
adventure
.
*NL*
After
a
brief
discussion
,
in
which
we
both
of
us
expressed
our
*NL*
resolution
of
not
descending
into
the
bay
until
the
ship
's
departure
,
*NL*
I
suggested
to
my
companion
that
little
of
it
as
there
was
,
we
should
*NL*
divide
the
bread
into
six
equal
portions
,
each
of
which
should
be
a
*NL*
day
's
allowance
for
both
of
us
.
This
proposition
he
assented
to
;
so
I
*NL*
took
the
silk
kerchief
from
my
neck
,
and
cutting
it
with
my
knife
into
*NL*
half
a
dozen
equal
pieces
,
proceeded
to
make
an
exact
division
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
Toby
with
a
degree
of
fastidiousness
that
seemed
to
me
*NL*
ill-timed
,
was
for
picking
out
the
minute
particles
of
tobacco
*NL*
with
which
the
spongy
mass
was
mixed
;
but
against
this
proceeding
I
*NL*
protested
,
as
by
such
an
operation
we
must
have
greatly
diminished
its
*NL*
quantity
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
division
was
accomplished
,
we
found
that
a
day
's
allowance
for
*NL*
the
two
was
not
a
great
deal
more
than
what
a
table-spoon
might
hold
.
*NL*
Each
separate
portion
we
immediately
rolled
up
in
the
bit
of
silk
*NL*
prepared
for
it
,
and
joining
them
all
together
into
a
small
package
,
I
*NL*
committed
them
,
with
solemn
injunctions
of
fidelity
,
to
the
custody
of
*NL*
Toby
.
For
the
remainder
of
that
day
we
resolved
to
fast
,
as
we
had
been
*NL*
fortified
by
a
breakfast
in
the
morning
;
and
now
starting
again
to
our
*NL*
feet
,
we
looked
about
us
for
a
shelter
during
the
night
,
which
,
from
the
*NL*
appearance
of
the
heavens
,
promised
to
be
a
dark
and
tempestuous
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
place
near
us
which
would
in
any
way
answer
our
purpose
,
*NL*
so
turning
our
backs
upon
Nukuheva
,
we
commenced
exploring
the
unknown
*NL*
regions
which
lay
upon
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
direction
,
as
far
as
our
vision
extended
,
not
a
sign
of
life
,
*NL*
nor
anything
that
denoted
even
the
transient
residence
of
man
,
could
be
*NL*
seen
.
The
whole
landscape
seemed
one
unbroken
solitude
,
the
interior
of
*NL*
the
island
having
apparently
been
untenanted
since
the
morning
of
the
*NL*
creation
;
and
as
we
advanced
through
this
wilderness
,
our
voices
*NL*
sounded
strangely
in
our
ears
,
as
though
human
accents
had
never
before
*NL*
disturbed
the
fearful
silence
of
the
place
,
interrupted
only
by
the
low
*NL*
murmurings
of
distant
waterfalls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
disappointment
,
however
,
in
not
finding
the
various
fruits
with
*NL*
which
we
had
intended
to
regale
ourselves
during
our
stay
in
these
*NL*
wilds
,
was
a
good
deal
lessened
by
the
consideration
that
from
this
very
*NL*
circumstance
we
should
be
much
less
exposed
to
a
casual
meeting
with
the
*NL*
savage
tribes
about
us
,
who
we
knew
always
dwelt
beneath
the
shadows
of
*NL*
those
trees
which
supplied
them
with
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
wandered
along
,
casting
eager
glances
into
every
bush
we
passed
,
*NL*
until
just
as
we
had
succeeded
in
mounting
one
of
the
many
ridges
that
*NL*
intersected
the
ground
,
I
saw
in
the
grass
before
me
something
like
an
*NL*
indistinctly
traced
footpath
,
which
appeared
to
lead
along
the
top
of
*NL*
the
ridge
,
and
to
descend
--
with
it
into
a
deep
ravine
about
half
a
mile
*NL*
in
advance
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robinson
Crusoe
could
not
have
been
more
startled
at
the
footprint
in
*NL*
the
sand
than
we
were
at
this
unwelcome
discovery
.
My
first
impulse
was
*NL*
to
make
as
rapid
a
retreat
as
possible
,
and
bend
our
steps
in
some
*NL*
other
direction
;
but
our
curiosity
to
see
whither
this
path
might
lead
,
*NL*
prompted
us
to
pursue
it
.
So
on
we
went
,
the
track
becoming
more
and
*NL*
more
visible
the
farther
we
proceeded
,
until
it
conducted
us
to
the
*NL*
verge
of
the
ravine
,
where
it
abruptly
terminated
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
so
,
'
said
Toby
,
peering
down
into
the
chasm
,
`
everyone
that
travels
*NL*
this
path
takes
a
jump
here
,
eh
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Not
so
,
'
said
I
,
`
for
I
think
they
might
manage
to
descend
without
it
;
*NL*
what
say
you
,
--
shall
we
attempt
the
feat
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
what
,
in
the
name
of
caves
and
coal-holes
,
do
you
expect
to
find
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
that
gulf
but
a
broken
neck
--
why
it
looks
blacker
than
our
*NL*
ship
's
hold
,
and
the
roar
of
those
waterfalls
down
there
would
batter
*NL*
one
's
brains
to
pieces
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
no
,
Toby
,
'
I
exclaimed
,
laughing
;
`
but
there
's
something
to
be
seen
*NL*
here
,
that
's
plain
,
or
there
would
have
been
no
path
,
and
I
am
resolved
*NL*
to
find
out
what
it
is
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
will
tell
you
what
,
my
pleasant
fellow
,
'
rejoined
Toby
quickly
,
`
if
*NL*
you
are
going
to
pry
into
everything
you
meet
with
here
that
excites
*NL*
your
curiosity
,
you
will
marvellously
soon
get
knocked
on
the
head
;
to
*NL*
a
dead
certainty
you
will
come
bang
upon
a
party
of
these
savages
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
your
discovery-makings
,
and
I
doubt
whether
such
an
event
would
*NL*
particularly
delight
you
,
just
take
my
advice
for
once
,
and
let
us
`
bout
*NL*
ship
and
steer
in
some
other
direction
;
besides
,
it
's
getting
late
and
*NL*
we
ought
to
be
mooring
ourselves
for
the
night
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
is
just
the
thing
I
have
been
driving
at
,
'
replied
I
;
`
and
I
am
*NL*
thinking
that
this
ravine
will
exactly
answer
our
purpose
,
for
it
is
*NL*
roomy
,
secluded
,
well
watered
,
and
may
shelter
us
from
the
weather
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aye
,
and
from
sleep
too
,
and
by
the
same
token
will
give
us
sore
*NL*
throats
,
and
rheumatisms
into
the
bargain
,
'
cried
Toby
,
with
evident
*NL*
dislike
at
the
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
very
well
then
,
my
lad
,
'
said
I
,
`
since
you
will
not
accompany
me
,
*NL*
here
I
go
alone
.
You
will
see
me
in
the
morning
;
'
and
advancing
to
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
cliff
upon
which
we
had
been
standing
,
I
proceeded
to
lower
*NL*
myself
down
by
the
tangled
roots
which
clustered
about
all
the
crevices
*NL*
of
the
rock
.
As
I
had
anticipated
,
Toby
,
in
spite
of
his
previous
*NL*
remonstrances
,
followed
my
example
,
and
dropping
himself
with
the
*NL*
activity
of
a
squirrel
from
point
to
point
,
he
quickly
outstripped
*NL*
me
and
effected
a
landing
at
the
bottom
before
I
had
accomplished
*NL*
two-thirds
of
the
descent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sight
that
now
greeted
us
was
one
that
will
ever
be
vividly
*NL*
impressed
upon
my
mind
.
Five
foaming
streams
,
rushing
through
as
many
*NL*
gorges
,
and
swelled
and
turbid
by
the
recent
rains
,
united
together
in
*NL*
one
mad
plunge
of
nearly
eighty
feet
,
and
fell
with
wild
uproar
into
a
*NL*
deep
black
pool
scooped
out
of
the
gloomy
looking
rocks
that
lay
piled
*NL*
around
,
and
thence
in
one
collected
body
dashed
down
a
narrow
sloping
*NL*
channel
which
seemed
to
penetrate
into
the
very
bowels
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
Overhead
,
vast
roots
of
trees
hung
down
from
the
sides
of
the
ravine
*NL*
dripping
with
moisture
,
and
trembling
with
the
concussions
produced
by
*NL*
the
fall
.
It
was
now
sunset
,
and
the
feeble
uncertain
light
that
found
*NL*
its
way
into
these
caverns
and
woody
depths
heightened
their
strange
*NL*
appearance
,
and
reminded
us
that
in
a
short
time
we
should
find
*NL*
ourselves
in
utter
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
had
satisfied
my
curiosity
by
gazing
at
this
scene
,
I
fell
*NL*
to
wondering
how
it
was
that
what
we
had
taken
for
a
path
should
have
*NL*
conducted
us
to
so
singular
a
place
,
and
began
to
suspect
that
after
all
*NL*
I
might
have
been
deceived
in
supposing
it
to
have
been
a
trick
*NL*
formed
by
the
islanders
.
This
was
rather
an
agreeable
reflection
than
*NL*
otherwise
,
for
it
diminished
our
dread
of
accidentally
meeting
with
any
*NL*
of
them
,
and
I
came
to
the
conclusion
that
perhaps
we
could
not
have
*NL*
selected
a
more
secure
hiding-place
than
this
very
spot
we
had
so
*NL*
accidentally
hit
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
agreed
with
me
in
this
view
of
the
matter
,
and
we
immediately
began
*NL*
gathering
together
the
limbs
of
trees
which
lay
scattered
about
,
with
*NL*
the
view
of
constructing
a
temporary
hut
for
the
night
.
This
we
were
*NL*
obliged
to
build
close
to
the
foot
of
the
cataract
,
for
the
current
of
*NL*
water
extended
very
nearly
to
the
sides
of
the
gorge
.
The
few
moments
*NL*
of
light
that
remained
we
employed
in
covering
our
hut
with
a
species
of
*NL*
broad-bladed
grass
that
grew
in
every
fissure
of
the
ravine
.
Our
hut
,
*NL*
if
it
deserved
to
be
called
one
,
consisted
of
six
or
eight
of
the
*NL*
straightest
branches
we
could
find
laid
obliquely
against
the
steep
wall
*NL*
of
rock
,
with
their
lower
ends
within
a
foot
of
the
stream
.
Into
the
*NL*
space
thus
covered
over
we
managed
to
crawl
,
and
dispose
our
wearied
*NL*
bodies
as
best
we
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shall
I
ever
forget
that
horrid
night
!
As
for
poor
Toby
,
I
could
*NL*
scarcely
get
a
word
out
of
him
.
It
would
have
been
some
consolation
to
*NL*
have
heard
his
voice
,
but
he
lay
shivering
the
live-long
night
like
a
*NL*
man
afflicted
with
the
palsy
,
with
his
knees
drawn
up
to
his
head
,
while
*NL*
his
back
was
supported
against
the
dripping
side
of
the
rock
.
During
*NL*
this
wretched
night
there
seemed
nothing
wanting
to
complete
the
perfect
*NL*
misery
of
our
condition
.
The
rain
descended
in
such
torrents
that
our
*NL*
poor
shelter
proved
a
mere
mockery
.
In
vain
did
I
try
to
elude
the
*NL*
incessant
streams
that
poured
upon
me
;
by
protecting
one
part
I
only
*NL*
exposed
another
,
and
the
water
was
continually
finding
some
new
opening
*NL*
through
which
to
drench
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
had
many
a
ducking
in
the
course
of
my
life
,
and
in
general
*NL*
cared
little
about
it
;
but
the
accumulated
horrors
of
that
night
,
the
*NL*
deathlike
coldness
of
the
place
,
the
appalling
darkness
and
the
dismal
*NL*
sense
of
our
forlorn
condition
,
almost
unmanned
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
not
be
doubted
that
the
next
morning
we
were
early
risers
,
and
*NL*
as
soon
as
I
could
catch
the
faintest
glimpse
of
anything
like
daylight
*NL*
I
shook
my
companion
by
the
arm
,
and
told
him
it
was
sunrise
.
Poor
Toby
*NL*
lifted
up
his
head
,
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
said
,
in
a
husky
voice
,
*NL*
`
Then
,
shipmate
,
my
toplights
have
gone
out
,
for
it
appears
darker
now
*NL*
with
my
eyes
open
that
it
did
when
they
were
shut
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nonsense
!
'
exclaimed
I
;
`
You
are
not
awake
yet
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Awake
!
'
roared
Toby
in
a
rage
,
`
awake
!
You
mean
to
insinuate
I
've
been
*NL*
asleep
,
do
you
?
It
is
an
insult
to
a
man
to
suppose
he
could
sleep
in
*NL*
such
an
infernal
place
as
this
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
I
had
apologized
to
my
friend
for
having
misconstrued
his
*NL*
silence
,
it
had
become
somewhat
more
light
,
and
we
crawled
out
of
our
*NL*
lair
.
The
rain
had
ceased
,
but
everything
around
us
was
dripping
with
*NL*
moisture
.
We
stripped
off
our
saturated
garments
,
and
wrung
them
as
dry
*NL*
as
we
could
.
We
contrived
to
make
the
blood
circulate
in
our
benumbed
*NL*
limbs
by
rubbing
them
vigorously
with
our
hands
;
and
after
performing
*NL*
our
ablutions
in
the
stream
,
and
putting
on
our
still
wet
clothes
,
*NL*
we
began
to
think
it
advisable
to
break
our
long
fast
,
it
being
now
*NL*
twenty-four
hours
since
we
had
tasted
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
our
day
's
ration
was
brought
out
,
and
seating
ourselves
on
a
*NL*
detached
fragment
of
rock
,
we
proceeded
to
discuss
it
.
First
we
divided
*NL*
it
into
two
equal
portions
,
and
carefully
rolling
one
of
them
up
for
our
*NL*
evening
's
repast
,
divided
the
remainder
again
as
equally
as
possible
,
*NL*
and
then
drew
lots
for
the
first
choice
.
I
could
have
placed
the
morsel
*NL*
that
fell
to
my
share
upon
the
tip
of
my
finger
;
but
notwithstanding
*NL*
this
I
took
care
that
it
should
be
full
ten
minutes
before
I
had
*NL*
swallowed
the
last
crumb
.
What
a
true
saying
it
is
that
`
appetite
*NL*
furnishes
the
best
sauce
.
'
There
was
a
flavour
and
a
relish
to
this
*NL*
small
particle
of
food
that
under
other
circumstances
it
would
have
*NL*
been
impossible
for
the
most
delicate
viands
to
have
imparted
.
A
copious
*NL*
draught
of
the
pure
water
which
flowed
at
our
feet
served
to
complete
*NL*
the
meal
,
and
after
it
we
rose
sensibly
refreshed
,
and
prepared
for
*NL*
whatever
might
befall
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
now
carefully
examined
the
chasm
in
which
we
had
passed
the
night
.
*NL*
We
crossed
the
stream
,
and
gaining
the
further
side
of
the
pool
I
have
*NL*
mentioned
,
discovered
proofs
that
the
spot
must
have
been
visited
by
*NL*
some
one
but
a
short
time
previous
to
our
arrival
.
Further
observation
*NL*
convinced
us
that
it
had
been
regularly
frequented
,
and
,
as
we
*NL*
afterwards
conjectured
from
particular
indications
,
for
the
purpose
*NL*
of
obtaining
a
certain
root
,
from
which
the
natives
obtained
a
kind
of
*NL*
ointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
discoveries
immediately
determined
us
to
abandon
a
place
which
*NL*
had
presented
no
inducement
for
us
to
remain
,
except
the
promise
of
*NL*
security
;
and
as
we
looked
about
us
for
the
means
of
ascending
again
*NL*
into
the
upper
regions
,
we
at
last
found
a
practicable
part
of
the
rock
,
*NL*
and
half
an
hour
's
toil
carried
us
to
the
summit
of
the
same
cliff
from
*NL*
which
the
preceding
evening
we
had
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
proposed
to
Toby
that
instead
of
rambling
about
the
island
,
*NL*
exposing
ourselves
to
discovery
at
every
turn
,
we
should
select
some
*NL*
place
as
our
fixed
abode
for
as
long
a
period
as
our
food
should
*NL*
hold
out
,
build
ourselves
a
comfortable
hut
,
and
be
as
prudent
and
*NL*
circumspect
as
possible
.
To
all
this
my
companion
assented
,
and
we
at
*NL*
once
set
about
carrying
the
plan
into
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
view
,
after
exploring
without
success
a
little
glen
near
us
,
*NL*
we
crossed
several
of
the
ridges
of
which
I
have
before
spoken
;
and
*NL*
about
noon
found
ourselves
ascending
a
long
and
gradually
rising
slope
,
*NL*
but
still
without
having
discovered
any
place
adapted
to
our
purpose
.
*NL*
Low
and
heavy
clouds
betokened
an
approaching
storm
,
and
we
hurried
on
*NL*
to
gain
a
covert
in
a
clump
of
thick
bushes
,
which
appeared
to
terminate
*NL*
the
long
ascent
.
We
threw
ourselves
under
the
lee
of
these
bushes
,
and
*NL*
pulling
up
the
long
grass
that
grew
around
,
covered
ourselves
completely
*NL*
with
it
,
and
awaited
the
shower
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
did
not
come
as
soon
as
we
had
expected
,
and
before
many
minutes
*NL*
my
companion
was
fast
asleep
,
and
I
was
rapidly
falling
into
the
same
*NL*
state
of
happy
forgetfulness
.
Just
at
this
juncture
,
however
,
down
came
*NL*
the
rain
with
the
violence
that
put
all
thoughts
of
slumber
to
flight
.
*NL*
Although
in
some
measure
sheltered
,
our
clothes
soon
became
as
wet
*NL*
as
ever
;
this
,
after
all
the
trouble
we
had
taken
to
dry
them
,
was
*NL*
provoking
enough
:
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
;
and
I
recommend
all
*NL*
adventurous
youths
who
abandon
vessels
in
romantic
islands
during
the
*NL*
rainy
season
to
provide
themselves
with
umbrellas
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
hour
or
so
the
shower
passed
away
.
My
companion
slept
through
*NL*
it
all
,
or
at
least
appeared
so
to
do
;
and
now
that
it
was
over
I
had
*NL*
not
the
heart
to
awaken
him
.
As
I
lay
on
my
back
completely
shrouded
*NL*
with
verdure
,
the
leafy
branches
drooping
over
me
,
my
limbs
buried
*NL*
in
grass
,
I
could
not
avoid
comparing
our
situation
with
that
of
the
*NL*
interesting
babes
in
the
wood
.
Poor
little
sufferers
!
--
no
wonder
their
*NL*
constitutions
broke
down
under
the
hardships
to
which
they
were
exposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
hour
or
two
spent
under
the
shelter
of
these
bushes
,
I
began
*NL*
to
feel
symptoms
which
I
at
once
attributed
to
the
exposure
of
the
*NL*
preceding
night
.
Cold
shiverings
and
a
burning
fever
succeeded
one
*NL*
another
at
intervals
,
while
one
of
my
legs
was
swelled
to
such
a
degree
,
*NL*
and
pained
me
so
acutely
,
that
I
half
suspected
I
had
been
bitten
by
*NL*
some
venomous
reptile
,
the
congenial
inhabitant
of
the
chasm
from
which
*NL*
we
had
lately
emerged
.
I
may
here
remark
by
the
way
--
what
I
subsequently
*NL*
gleamed
--
that
all
the
islands
of
Polynesia
enjoy
the
reputation
,
in
*NL*
common
with
the
Hibernian
isle
,
of
being
free
from
the
presence
of
any
*NL*
vipers
;
though
whether
Saint
Patrick
ever
visited
them
,
is
a
question
I
*NL*
shall
not
attempt
to
decide
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
feverish
sensation
increased
upon
me
I
tossed
about
,
still
*NL*
unwilling
to
disturb
my
slumbering
companion
,
from
whose
side
I
removed
*NL*
two
or
three
yards
.
I
chanced
to
push
aside
a
branch
,
and
by
so
doing
*NL*
suddenly
disclosed
to
my
view
a
scene
which
even
now
I
can
recall
with
*NL*
all
the
vividness
of
the
first
impression
.
Had
a
glimpse
of
the
gardens
*NL*
of
Paradise
been
revealed
to
me
,
I
could
scarcely
have
been
more
*NL*
ravished
with
the
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
spot
where
I
lay
transfixed
with
surprise
and
delight
,
I
looked
*NL*
straight
down
into
the
bosom
of
a
valley
,
which
swept
away
in
long
wavy
*NL*
undulations
to
the
blue
waters
in
the
distance
.
Midway
towards
the
*NL*
sea
,
and
peering
here
and
there
amidst
the
foliage
,
might
be
seen
the
*NL*
palmetto-thatched
houses
of
its
inhabitants
glistening
in
the
sun
that
*NL*
had
bleached
them
to
a
dazzling
whiteness
.
The
vale
was
more
than
three
*NL*
leagues
in
length
,
and
about
a
mile
across
at
its
greatest
width
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
either
side
it
appeared
hemmed
in
by
steep
and
green
acclivities
,
*NL*
which
,
uniting
near
the
spot
where
I
lay
,
formed
an
abrupt
and
*NL*
semicircular
termination
of
grassy
cliffs
and
precipices
hundreds
of
*NL*
feet
in
height
,
over
which
flowed
numberless
small
cascades
.
But
the
*NL*
crowning
beauty
of
the
prospect
was
its
universal
verdure
;
and
in
this
*NL*
indeed
consists
,
I
believe
,
the
peculiar
charm
of
every
Polynesian
*NL*
landscape
.
Everywhere
below
me
,
from
the
base
of
the
precipice
upon
*NL*
whose
very
verge
I
had
been
unconsciously
reposing
,
the
surface
of
the
*NL*
vale
presented
a
mass
of
foliage
,
spread
with
such
rich
profusion
*NL*
that
it
was
impossible
to
determine
of
what
description
of
trees
it
*NL*
consisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
perhaps
there
was
nothing
about
the
scenery
I
beheld
more
impressive
*NL*
than
those
silent
cascades
,
whose
slender
threads
of
water
,
after
*NL*
leaping
down
the
steep
cliffs
,
were
lost
amidst
the
rich
herbage
of
the
*NL*
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
all
the
landscape
there
reigned
the
most
hushed
repose
,
which
I
*NL*
almost
feared
to
break
,
lest
,
like
the
enchanted
gardens
in
the
fairy
*NL*
tale
,
a
single
syllable
might
dissolve
the
spell
.
For
a
long
time
,
*NL*
forgetful
alike
of
my
own
situation
,
and
the
vicinity
of
my
still
*NL*
slumbering
companion
,
I
remained
gazing
around
me
,
hardly
able
to
*NL*
comprehend
by
what
means
I
had
thus
suddenly
been
made
a
spectator
of
*NL*
such
a
scene
.

*NL*
*NL*
RECOVERING
from
my
astonishment
at
the
beautiful
scene
before
me
,
I
*NL*
quickly
awakened
Toby
,
and
informed
him
of
the
discovery
I
had
made
.
*NL*
Together
we
now
repaired
to
the
border
of
the
precipice
,
and
my
*NL*
companion
's
admiration
was
equal
to
my
own
.
A
little
reflection
,
*NL*
however
,
abated
our
surprise
at
coming
so
unexpectedly
upon
this
valley
,
*NL*
since
the
large
vales
of
Happar
and
Typee
,
lying
upon
this
side
of
*NL*
Nukuheva
,
and
extending
a
considerable
distance
from
the
sea
towards
the
*NL*
interior
,
must
necessarily
terminate
somewhere
about
this
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
now
was
as
to
which
of
those
two
places
we
were
looking
*NL*
down
upon
.
Toby
insisted
that
it
was
the
abode
of
the
Happar
,
and
I
that
*NL*
it
was
tenanted
by
their
enemies
the
ferocious
Typees
.
To
be
sure
I
was
*NL*
not
entirely
convinced
by
my
own
arguments
,
but
Toby
's
proposition
to
*NL*
descend
at
once
into
the
valley
,
and
partake
of
the
hospitality
of
its
*NL*
inmates
,
seemed
to
me
to
be
risking
so
much
upon
the
strength
of
a
mere
*NL*
supposition
,
that
I
resolved
to
oppose
it
until
we
had
more
evidence
to
*NL*
proceed
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
point
was
one
of
vital
importance
,
as
the
natives
of
Happar
were
*NL*
not
only
at
peace
with
Nukuheva
,
but
cultivated
with
its
inhabitants
the
*NL*
most
friendly
relations
,
and
enjoyed
besides
a
reputation
for
gentleness
*NL*
and
humanity
which
led
us
to
expect
from
them
,
if
not
a
cordial
*NL*
reception
,
at
least
a
shelter
during
the
short
period
we
should
remain
*NL*
in
their
territory
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
the
very
name
of
Typee
struck
a
panic
into
my
heart
*NL*
which
I
did
not
attempt
to
disguise
.
The
thought
of
voluntarily
throwing
*NL*
ourselves
into
the
hands
of
these
cruel
savages
,
seemed
to
me
an
act
*NL*
of
mere
madness
;
and
almost
equally
so
the
idea
of
venturing
into
the
*NL*
valley
,
uncertain
by
which
of
these
two
tribes
it
was
inhabited
.
That
*NL*
the
vale
at
our
feet
was
tenanted
by
one
of
them
,
was
a
point
that
*NL*
appeared
to
us
past
all
doubt
,
since
we
knew
that
they
resided
in
this
*NL*
quarter
,
although
our
information
did
not
enlighten
us
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
,
however
,
incapable
of
resisting
the
tempting
prospect
*NL*
which
the
place
held
out
of
an
abundant
supply
of
food
and
other
means
*NL*
of
enjoyment
,
still
clung
to
his
own
inconsiderate
view
of
the
subject
,
*NL*
nor
could
all
my
reasoning
shake
it
.
When
I
reminded
him
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
either
of
us
to
know
anything
with
certainty
,
and
when
*NL*
I
dwelt
upon
the
horrible
fate
we
should
encounter
were
we
rashly
*NL*
to
descend
into
the
valley
,
and
discover
too
late
the
error
we
had
*NL*
committed
,
he
replied
by
detailing
all
the
evils
of
our
present
*NL*
condition
,
and
the
sufferings
we
must
undergo
should
we
continue
to
*NL*
remain
where
we
then
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anxious
to
draw
him
away
from
the
subject
,
if
possible
--
for
I
saw
*NL*
that
it
would
be
in
vain
to
attempt
changing
his
mind
--
I
directed
his
*NL*
attention
to
a
long
bright
unwooded
tract
of
land
which
,
sweeping
down
*NL*
from
the
elevations
in
the
interior
,
descended
into
the
valley
before
*NL*
us
.
I
then
suggested
to
him
that
beyond
this
ridge
might
lie
a
capacious
*NL*
and
untenanted
valley
,
abounding
with
all
manner
of
delicious
fruits
;
*NL*
for
I
had
heard
that
there
were
several
such
upon
the
island
,
and
*NL*
proposed
that
we
should
endeavour
to
reach
it
,
and
if
we
found
our
*NL*
expectations
realized
we
should
at
once
take
refuge
in
it
and
remain
*NL*
there
as
long
as
we
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
acquiesced
in
the
suggestion
;
and
we
immediately
,
therefore
,
began
*NL*
surveying
the
country
lying
before
us
,
with
a
view
of
determining
upon
*NL*
the
best
route
for
us
to
pursue
;
but
it
presented
little
choice
,
the
*NL*
whole
interval
being
broken
into
steep
ridges
,
divided
by
dark
ravines
,
*NL*
extending
in
parallel
lines
at
right
angles
to
our
direct
course
.
All
*NL*
these
we
would
be
obliged
to
cross
before
we
could
hope
to
arrive
at
our
*NL*
destination
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
weary
journey
!
But
we
decided
to
undertake
it
,
though
,
for
my
own
*NL*
part
,
I
felt
little
prepared
to
encounter
its
fatigues
,
shivering
and
*NL*
burning
by
turns
with
the
ague
and
fever
;
for
I
know
not
how
else
to
*NL*
describe
the
alternate
sensations
I
experienced
,
and
suffering
not
*NL*
a
little
from
the
lameness
which
afflicted
me
.
Added
to
this
was
the
*NL*
faintness
consequent
on
our
meagre
diet
--
a
calamity
in
which
Toby
*NL*
participated
to
the
same
extent
as
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
circumstances
,
however
,
only
augmented
my
anxiety
to
reach
a
place
*NL*
which
promised
us
plenty
and
repose
,
before
I
should
be
reduced
to
a
*NL*
state
which
would
render
me
altogether
unable
to
perform
the
journey
.
*NL*
Accordingly
we
now
commenced
it
by
descending
the
almost
perpendicular
*NL*
side
of
a
steep
and
narrow
gorge
,
bristling
with
a
thick
growth
of
*NL*
reeds
.
Here
there
was
but
one
mode
for
us
to
adopt
.
We
seated
ourselves
*NL*
upon
the
ground
,
and
guided
our
descent
by
catching
at
the
canes
in
our
*NL*
path
.
This
velocity
with
which
we
thus
slid
down
the
side
of
the
ravine
*NL*
soon
brought
us
to
a
point
where
we
could
use
our
feet
,
and
in
a
short
*NL*
time
we
arrived
at
the
edge
of
the
torrent
,
which
rolled
impetuously
*NL*
along
the
bed
of
the
chasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
taking
a
refreshing
draught
from
the
water
of
the
stream
,
we
*NL*
addressed
ourselves
to
a
much
more
difficult
undertaking
than
the
last
.
*NL*
Every
foot
of
our
late
descent
had
to
be
regained
in
ascending
the
*NL*
opposite
side
of
the
gorge
--
an
operation
rendered
the
less
agreeable
*NL*
from
the
consideration
that
in
these
perpendicular
episodes
we
did
not
*NL*
progress
a
hundred
yards
on
our
journey
.
But
,
ungrateful
as
the
task
*NL*
was
,
we
set
about
it
with
exemplary
patience
,
and
after
a
snail-like
*NL*
progress
of
an
hour
or
more
,
had
scaled
perhaps
one
half
of
the
*NL*
distance
,
when
the
fever
which
had
left
me
for
a
while
returned
with
*NL*
such
violence
,
and
accompanied
by
so
raging
a
thirst
,
that
it
required
*NL*
all
the
entreaties
of
Toby
to
prevent
me
from
losing
all
the
fruits
of
*NL*
my
late
exertion
,
by
precipitating
myself
madly
down
the
cliffs
we
had
*NL*
just
climbed
,
in
quest
of
the
water
which
flowed
so
temptingly
at
their
*NL*
base
.
At
the
moment
all
my
hopes
and
fears
appeared
to
be
merged
in
*NL*
this
one
desire
,
careless
of
the
consequences
that
might
result
from
its
*NL*
gratification
.
I
am
aware
of
no
feeling
,
either
of
pleasure
or
of
pain
,
*NL*
that
so
completely
deprives
one
of
an
power
to
resist
its
impulses
,
as
*NL*
this
same
raging
thirst
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
earnestly
conjured
me
to
continue
the
ascent
,
assuring
me
that
a
*NL*
little
more
exertion
would
bring
us
to
the
summit
,
and
that
then
in
less
*NL*
than
five
minutes
we
should
find
ourselves
at
the
brink
of
the
stream
,
*NL*
which
must
necessarily
flow
on
the
other
side
of
the
ridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
not
,
'
he
exclaimed
,
`
turn
back
,
now
that
we
have
proceeded
thus
far
;
*NL*
for
I
tell
you
that
neither
of
us
will
have
the
courage
to
repeat
the
*NL*
attempt
,
if
once
more
we
find
ourselves
looking
up
to
where
we
now
are
*NL*
from
the
bottom
of
these
rocks
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
yet
so
perfectly
beside
myself
as
to
be
heedless
of
these
*NL*
representations
,
and
therefore
toiled
on
,
ineffectually
endeavouring
to
*NL*
appease
the
thirst
which
consumed
me
,
by
thinking
that
in
a
short
time
I
*NL*
should
be
able
to
gratify
it
to
my
heart
's
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
we
gained
the
top
of
the
second
elevation
,
the
loftiest
of
*NL*
those
I
have
described
as
extending
in
parallel
lines
between
us
and
the
*NL*
valley
we
desired
to
reach
.
It
commanded
a
view
of
the
whole
intervening
*NL*
distance
;
and
,
discouraged
as
I
was
by
other
circumstances
,
this
*NL*
prospect
plunged
me
into
the
very
depths
of
despair
.
Nothing
but
dark
*NL*
and
fearful
chasms
,
separated
by
sharp-crested
and
perpendicular
ridges
*NL*
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
.
Could
we
have
stepped
from
summit
*NL*
to
summit
of
these
steep
but
narrow
elevations
we
could
easily
have
*NL*
accomplished
the
distance
;
but
we
must
penetrate
to
the
bottom
of
every
*NL*
yawning
gulf
,
and
scale
in
succession
every
one
of
the
eminences
before
*NL*
us
.
Even
Toby
,
although
not
suffering
as
I
did
,
was
not
proof
against
*NL*
the
disheartening
influences
of
the
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
we
did
not
long
stand
to
contemplate
it
,
impatient
as
I
was
to
reach
*NL*
the
waters
of
the
torrent
which
flowed
beneath
us
.
With
an
insensibility
*NL*
to
danger
which
I
can
not
call
to
mind
without
shuddering
,
we
threw
*NL*
ourselves
down
the
depths
of
the
ravine
,
startling
its
savage
solitudes
*NL*
with
the
echoes
produced
by
the
falling
fragments
of
rock
we
every
*NL*
moment
dislodged
from
their
places
,
careless
of
the
insecurity
of
our
*NL*
footing
,
and
reckless
whether
the
slight
roots
and
twigs
we
clutched
at
*NL*
sustained
us
for
the
while
,
or
treacherously
yielded
to
our
grasp
.
For
*NL*
my
own
part
,
I
scarcely
knew
whether
I
was
helplessly
falling
from
the
*NL*
heights
above
,
or
whether
the
fearful
rapidity
with
which
I
descended
*NL*
was
an
act
of
my
own
volition
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
we
reached
the
foot
of
the
gorge
,
and
kneeling
upon
*NL*
a
small
ledge
of
dripping
rocks
,
I
bent
over
to
the
stream
.
What
a
*NL*
delicious
sensation
was
I
now
to
experience
!
I
paused
for
a
second
to
*NL*
concentrate
all
my
capabilities
of
enjoyment
,
and
then
immerged
my
lips
*NL*
in
the
clear
element
before
me
.
Had
the
apples
of
Sodom
turned
to
ashes
*NL*
in
my
mouth
,
I
could
not
have
felt
a
more
startling
revulsion
.
A
single
*NL*
drop
of
the
cold
fluid
seemed
to
freeze
every
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
;
*NL*
the
fever
that
had
been
burning
in
my
veins
gave
place
on
the
instant
to
*NL*
death-like
chills
,
which
shook
me
one
after
another
like
so
many
shocks
*NL*
of
electricity
,
while
the
perspiration
produced
by
my
late
violent
*NL*
exertions
congealed
in
icy
beads
upon
my
forehead
.
My
thirst
was
gone
,
*NL*
and
I
fairly
loathed
the
water
.
Starting
to
my
feet
,
the
sight
of
those
*NL*
dank
rocks
,
oozing
forth
moisture
at
every
crevice
,
and
the
dark
*NL*
stream
shooting
along
its
dismal
channel
,
sent
fresh
chills
through
*NL*
my
shivering
frame
,
and
I
felt
as
uncontrollable
a
desire
to
climb
up
*NL*
towards
the
genial
sunlight
as
I
before
had
to
descend
the
ravine
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
two
hours
'
perilous
exertions
we
stood
upon
the
summit
of
another
*NL*
ridge
,
and
it
was
with
difficulty
I
could
bring
myself
to
believe
that
*NL*
we
had
ever
penetrated
the
black
and
yawning
chasm
which
then
gaped
at
*NL*
our
feet
.
Again
we
gazed
upon
the
prospect
which
the
height
commanded
,
*NL*
but
it
was
just
as
depressing
as
the
one
which
had
before
met
our
eyes
.
*NL*
I
now
felt
that
in
our
present
situation
it
was
in
vain
for
us
to
think
*NL*
of
ever
overcoming
the
obstacles
in
our
way
,
and
I
gave
up
all
thoughts
*NL*
of
reaching
the
vale
which
lay
beyond
this
series
of
impediments
;
while
*NL*
at
the
same
time
I
could
not
devise
any
scheme
to
extricate
ourselves
*NL*
from
the
difficulties
in
which
we
were
involved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
remotest
idea
of
returning
to
Nukuheva
,
unless
assured
of
our
*NL*
vessel
's
departure
,
never
once
entered
my
mind
,
and
indeed
it
was
*NL*
questionable
whether
we
could
have
succeeded
in
reaching
it
,
divided
as
*NL*
we
were
from
the
bay
by
a
distance
we
could
not
compute
,
and
perplexed
*NL*
too
in
our
remembrance
of
localities
by
our
recent
wanderings
.
Besides
,
*NL*
it
was
unendurable
the
thought
of
retracing
our
steps
and
rendering
all
*NL*
our
painful
exertions
of
no
avail
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
scarcely
anything
when
a
man
is
in
difficulties
that
he
is
*NL*
more
disposed
to
look
upon
with
abhorrence
than
a
rightabout
retrograde
*NL*
movement
--
a
systematic
going
over
of
the
already
trodden
ground
:
*NL*
and
especially
if
he
has
a
love
of
adventure
,
such
a
course
appears
*NL*
indescribably
repulsive
,
so
long
as
there
remains
the
least
hope
to
be
*NL*
derived
from
braving
untried
difficulties
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
feeling
that
prompted
us
to
descend
the
opposite
side
of
the
*NL*
elevation
we
had
just
scaled
,
although
with
what
definite
object
in
view
*NL*
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
either
of
us
to
tell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
exchanging
a
syllable
upon
the
subject
,
Toby
and
myself
*NL*
simultaneously
renounced
the
design
which
had
lured
us
thus
*NL*
far
--
perceiving
in
each
other
's
countenances
that
desponding
expression
*NL*
which
speaks
more
eloquently
than
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Together
we
stood
towards
the
close
of
this
weary
day
in
the
cavity
of
*NL*
the
third
gorge
we
had
entered
,
wholly
incapacitated
for
any
further
*NL*
exertion
,
until
restored
to
some
degree
of
strength
by
food
and
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
seated
ourselves
upon
the
least
uncomfortable
spot
we
could
select
,
*NL*
and
Toby
produced
from
the
bosom
of
his
frock
the
sacred
package
.
In
*NL*
silence
we
partook
of
the
small
morsel
of
refreshment
that
had
been
left
*NL*
from
the
morning
's
repast
,
and
without
once
proposing
to
violate
the
*NL*
sanctity
of
our
engagement
with
respect
to
the
remainder
,
we
rose
to
*NL*
our
feet
,
and
proceeded
to
construct
some
sort
of
shelter
under
which
we
*NL*
might
obtain
the
sleep
we
so
greatly
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
the
spot
was
better
adapted
to
our
purpose
than
the
one
in
*NL*
which
we
had
passed
the
last
wretched
night
.
We
cleared
away
the
tall
*NL*
reeds
from
the
small
but
almost
level
bit
of
ground
,
and
twisted
them
*NL*
into
a
low
basket-like
hut
,
which
we
covered
with
a
profusion
of
long
*NL*
thick
leaves
,
gathered
from
a
tree
near
at
hand
.
We
disposed
them
*NL*
thickly
all
around
,
reserving
only
a
slight
opening
that
barely
*NL*
permitted
us
to
crawl
under
the
shelter
we
had
thus
obtained
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
deep
recesses
,
though
protected
from
the
winds
that
assail
the
*NL*
summits
of
their
lofty
sides
,
are
damp
and
chill
to
a
degree
that
one
*NL*
would
hardly
anticipate
in
such
a
climate
;
and
being
unprovided
with
*NL*
anything
but
our
woollen
frocks
and
thin
duck
trousers
to
resist
the
*NL*
cold
of
the
place
,
we
were
the
more
solicitous
to
render
our
habitation
*NL*
for
the
night
as
comfortable
as
we
could
.
Accordingly
,
in
addition
to
*NL*
what
we
had
already
done
,
we
plucked
down
all
the
leaves
within
our
*NL*
reach
and
threw
them
in
a
heap
over
our
little
hut
,
into
which
we
now
*NL*
crept
,
raking
after
us
a
reserved
supply
to
form
our
couch
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
nothing
but
the
pain
I
suffered
prevented
me
from
sleeping
*NL*
most
refreshingly
.
As
it
was
,
I
caught
two
or
three
naps
,
while
Toby
*NL*
slept
away
at
my
side
as
soundly
as
though
he
had
been
sandwiched
*NL*
between
two
Holland
sheets
.
Luckily
it
did
not
rain
,
and
we
were
*NL*
preserved
from
the
misery
which
a
heavy
shower
would
have
occasioned
*NL*
us
.
In
the
morning
I
was
awakened
by
the
sonorous
voice
of
my
companion
*NL*
ringing
in
my
ears
and
bidding
me
rise
.
I
crawled
out
from
our
heap
of
*NL*
leaves
,
and
was
astonished
at
the
change
which
a
good
night
's
rest
had
*NL*
wrought
in
his
appearance
.
He
was
as
blithe
and
joyous
as
a
young
bird
,
*NL*
and
was
staying
the
keenness
of
his
morning
's
appetite
by
chewing
the
*NL*
soft
bark
of
a
delicate
branch
he
held
in
his
hand
,
and
he
recommended
*NL*
the
like
to
me
as
an
admirable
antidote
against
the
gnawings
of
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
though
feeling
materially
better
than
I
had
done
the
*NL*
preceding
evening
,
I
could
not
look
at
the
limb
that
had
pained
me
*NL*
so
violently
at
intervals
during
the
last
twenty-four
hours
,
without
*NL*
experiencing
a
sense
of
alarm
that
I
strove
in
vain
to
shake
off
.
*NL*
Unwilling
to
disturb
the
flow
of
my
comrade
's
spirits
,
I
managed
to
*NL*
stifle
the
complaints
to
which
I
might
otherwise
have
given
vent
,
and
*NL*
calling
upon
him
good-humouredly
to
speed
our
banquet
,
I
prepared
myself
*NL*
for
it
by
washing
in
the
stream
.
This
operation
concluded
,
we
swallowed
,
*NL*
or
rather
absorbed
,
by
a
peculiar
kind
of
slow
sucking
process
,
our
*NL*
respective
morsels
of
nourishment
,
and
then
entered
into
a
discussion
as
*NL*
to
the
steps
is
was
necessary
for
us
to
pursue
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
to
be
done
now
?
'
inquired
I
,
rather
dolefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Descend
into
that
same
valley
we
descried
yesterday
.
'
rejoined
Toby
,
*NL*
with
a
rapidity
and
loudness
of
utterance
that
almost
led
me
to
suspect
*NL*
he
had
been
slyly
devouring
the
broadside
of
an
ox
in
some
of
the
*NL*
adjoining
thickets
.
`
What
else
,
'
he
continued
,
`
remains
for
us
to
do
but
*NL*
that
,
to
be
sure
?
Why
,
we
shall
both
starve
to
a
certainty
if
we
remain
*NL*
here
;
and
as
to
your
fears
of
those
Typees
--
depend
upon
it
,
it
is
all
*NL*
nonsense
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
impossible
that
the
inhabitants
of
such
a
lovely
place
as
we
*NL*
saw
can
be
anything
else
but
good
fellows
;
and
if
you
choose
rather
to
*NL*
perish
with
hunger
in
one
of
these
soppy
caverns
,
I
for
one
prefer
to
*NL*
chance
a
bold
descent
into
the
valley
,
and
risk
the
consequences
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
who
is
to
pilot
us
thither
,
'
I
asked
,
`
even
if
we
should
decide
*NL*
upon
the
measure
you
propose
?
Are
we
to
go
again
up
and
down
those
*NL*
precipices
that
we
crossed
yesterday
,
until
we
reach
the
place
we
*NL*
started
from
,
and
then
take
a
flying
leap
from
the
cliffs
to
the
*NL*
valley
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Faith
,
I
did
n't
think
of
that
,
'
said
Toby
;
`
sure
enough
,
both
sides
of
*NL*
the
valley
appeared
to
be
hemmed
in
by
precipices
,
did
n't
they
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
answered
I
,
`
as
steep
as
the
sides
of
a
line-of-battle
ship
,
*NL*
and
about
a
hundred
times
as
high
.
'
My
companion
sank
his
head
upon
his
*NL*
breast
,
and
remained
for
a
while
in
deep
thought
.
Suddenly
he
sprang
to
*NL*
his
feet
,
while
his
eyes
lighted
up
with
that
gleam
of
intelligence
that
*NL*
marks
the
presence
of
some
bright
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
yes
,
'
he
exclaimed
;
`
the
streams
all
run
in
the
same
direction
,
*NL*
and
must
necessarily
flow
into
the
valley
before
they
reach
the
sea
;
all
*NL*
we
have
to
do
is
just
to
follow
this
stream
,
and
sooner
or
later
it
will
*NL*
lead
us
into
the
vale
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
right
,
Toby
,
'
I
exclaimed
,
`
you
are
right
;
it
must
conduct
us
*NL*
thither
,
and
quickly
too
;
for
,
see
with
what
a
steep
inclination
the
*NL*
water
descends
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
does
,
indeed
,
'
burst
forth
my
companion
,
overjoyed
at
my
*NL*
verification
of
his
theory
,
`
it
does
indeed
;
why
,
it
is
as
plain
as
a
*NL*
pike-staff
.
Let
us
proceed
at
once
;
come
,
throw
away
all
those
stupid
*NL*
ideas
about
the
Typees
,
and
hurrah
for
the
lovely
valley
of
the
*NL*
Happars
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
will
have
it
to
be
Happar
,
I
see
,
my
dear
fellow
;
pray
Heaven
you
*NL*
may
not
find
yourself
deceived
,
'
observed
I
,
with
a
shake
of
my
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Amen
to
all
that
,
and
much
more
,
'
shouted
Toby
,
rushing
forward
;
`
but
*NL*
Happar
it
is
,
for
nothing
else
than
Happar
can
it
be
.
So
glorious
a
*NL*
valley
--
such
forests
of
bread-fruit
trees
--
such
groves
of
cocoanut
--
such
*NL*
wilderness
of
guava-bushes
!
Ah
!
shipmate
!
do
n't
linger
behind
:
in
the
*NL*
name
of
all
delightful
fruits
,
I
am
dying
to
be
at
them
.
Come
on
,
come
*NL*
on
;
shove
ahead
,
there
's
a
lively
lad
;
never
mind
the
rocks
;
kick
them
*NL*
out
of
the
way
,
as
I
do
;
and
tomorrow
,
old
fellow
,
take
my
word
for
*NL*
it
,
we
shall
be
in
clover
.
Come
on
;
'
and
so
saying
,
he
dashed
along
the
*NL*
ravine
like
a
madman
,
forgetting
my
inability
to
keep
up
with
him
.
In
a
*NL*
few
minutes
,
however
,
the
exuberance
of
his
spirits
abated
,
and
,
pausing
*NL*
for
a
while
,
he
permitted
me
to
overtake
him
.

CHAPTER
NINE
*NL*
*NL*
PERILOUS
PASSAGE
OF
THE
RAVINE
--
DESCENT
INTO
THE
VALLEY
*NL*
*NL*
The
fearless
confidence
of
Toby
was
contagious
,
and
I
began
to
adopt
the
*NL*
Happar
side
of
the
question
.
I
could
not
,
however
,
overcome
a
certain
*NL*
feeling
of
trepidation
as
we
made
our
way
along
these
gloomy
solitudes
.
*NL*
Our
progress
,
at
first
comparatively
easy
,
became
more
and
more
*NL*
difficult
.
The
bed
of
the
watercourse
was
covered
with
fragments
of
*NL*
broken
rocks
,
which
had
fallen
from
above
,
offering
so
many
obstructions
*NL*
to
the
course
of
the
rapid
stream
,
which
vexed
and
fretted
about
*NL*
them
,
--
forming
at
intervals
small
waterfalls
,
pouring
over
into
deep
*NL*
basins
,
or
splashing
wildly
upon
heaps
of
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
narrowness
of
the
gorge
,
and
the
steepness
of
its
sides
,
there
*NL*
was
no
mode
of
advancing
but
by
wading
through
the
water
;
stumbling
*NL*
every
moment
over
the
impediments
which
lay
hidden
under
its
surface
,
*NL*
or
tripping
against
the
huge
roots
of
trees
.
But
the
most
annoying
*NL*
hindrance
we
encountered
was
from
a
multitude
of
crooked
boughs
,
which
,
*NL*
shooting
out
almost
horizontally
from
the
sides
of
the
chasm
,
twisted
*NL*
themselves
together
in
fantastic
masses
almost
to
the
surface
of
the
*NL*
stream
,
affording
us
no
passage
except
under
the
low
arches
which
they
*NL*
formed
.
Under
these
we
were
obliged
to
crawl
on
our
hands
and
feet
,
*NL*
sliding
along
the
oozy
surface
of
the
rocks
,
or
slipping
into
the
deep
*NL*
pools
,
and
with
scarce
light
enough
to
guide
us
.
Occasionally
we
would
*NL*
strike
our
heads
against
some
projecting
limb
of
a
tree
;
and
while
*NL*
imprudently
engaged
in
rubbing
the
injured
part
,
would
fall
sprawling
*NL*
amongst
flinty
fragments
,
cutting
and
bruising
ourselves
,
whilst
the
*NL*
unpitying
waters
flowed
over
our
prostrate
bodies
.
Belzoni
,
worming
*NL*
himself
through
the
subterranean
passages
of
the
Egyptian
catacombs
,
*NL*
could
not
have
met
with
great
impediments
than
those
we
here
*NL*
encountered
.
But
we
struggled
against
them
manfully
,
well
knowing
our
*NL*
only
hope
lay
in
advancing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
sunset
we
halted
at
a
spot
where
we
made
preparations
for
*NL*
passing
the
night
.
Here
we
constructed
a
hut
,
in
much
the
same
way
as
*NL*
before
,
and
crawling
into
it
,
endeavoured
to
forget
our
sufferings
.
My
*NL*
companion
,
I
believe
,
slept
pretty
soundly
;
but
at
day
break
,
when
we
*NL*
rolled
out
of
our
dwelling
,
I
felt
nearly
disqualified
for
any
further
*NL*
efforts
.
Toby
prescribed
as
a
remedy
for
my
illness
the
contents
of
one
*NL*
of
our
little
silk
packages
,
to
be
taken
at
once
in
a
single
dose
.
To
*NL*
this
species
of
medical
treatment
,
however
,
I
would
by
no
means
accede
,
*NL*
much
as
he
insisted
upon
it
;
and
so
we
partook
of
our
usual
morsel
,
and
*NL*
silently
resumed
our
journey
.
It
was
now
the
fourth
day
since
we
left
*NL*
Nukuheva
,
and
the
gnawings
of
hunger
became
painfully
acute
.
We
were
*NL*
fain
to
pacify
them
by
chewing
the
tender
bark
of
roots
and
twigs
,
*NL*
which
,
if
they
did
not
afford
us
nourishment
,
were
at
least
sweet
and
*NL*
pleasant
to
the
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
progress
along
the
steep
watercourse
was
necessarily
slow
,
and
by
*NL*
noon
we
had
not
advanced
more
than
a
mile
.
It
was
somewhere
near
this
*NL*
part
of
the
day
that
the
noise
of
falling
waters
,
which
we
had
faintly
*NL*
caught
in
the
early
morning
,
became
more
distinct
;
and
it
was
not
long
*NL*
before
we
were
arrested
by
a
rocky
precipice
of
nearly
a
hundred
feet
*NL*
in
depth
,
that
extended
all
across
the
channel
,
and
over
which
the
wild
*NL*
stream
poured
in
an
unbroken
leap
.
On
each
hand
the
walls
of
the
*NL*
ravine
presented
their
overhanging
sides
both
above
and
below
the
fall
,
*NL*
affording
no
means
whatever
of
avoiding
the
cataract
by
taking
a
circuit
*NL*
round
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
's
to
be
done
now
,
Toby
?
'
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
'
rejoined
he
,
`
as
we
can
not
retreat
,
I
suppose
we
must
keep
*NL*
shoving
along
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
true
,
my
dear
Toby
;
but
how
do
you
purpose
accomplishing
that
*NL*
desirable
object
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
jumping
from
the
top
of
the
fall
,
if
there
be
no
other
way
,
'
*NL*
unhesitatingly
replied
my
companion
:
`
it
will
be
much
the
quickest
way
*NL*
of
descent
;
but
as
you
are
not
quite
as
active
as
I
am
,
we
will
try
some
*NL*
other
way
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
so
saying
,
he
crept
cautiously
along
and
peered
over
into
the
*NL*
abyss
,
while
I
remained
wondering
by
what
possible
means
we
could
*NL*
overcome
this
apparently
insuperable
obstruction
.
As
soon
as
my
*NL*
companion
had
completed
his
survey
,
I
eagerly
inquired
the
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
result
of
my
observations
you
wish
to
know
,
do
you
?
'
began
Toby
,
*NL*
deliberately
,
with
one
of
his
odd
looks
:
`
well
,
my
lad
,
the
result
of
my
*NL*
observations
is
very
quickly
imparted
.
It
is
at
present
uncertain
which
*NL*
of
our
two
necks
will
have
the
honour
to
be
broken
first
;
but
about
a
*NL*
hundred
to
one
would
be
a
fair
bet
in
favour
of
the
man
who
takes
the
*NL*
first
jump
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
it
is
an
impossible
thing
,
is
it
?
'
inquired
I
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
shipmate
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
is
the
easiest
thing
in
life
:
the
*NL*
only
awkward
point
is
the
sort
of
usage
which
our
unhappy
limbs
may
*NL*
receive
when
we
arrive
at
the
bottom
,
and
what
sort
of
travelling
trim
*NL*
we
shall
be
in
afterwards
.
But
follow
me
now
,
and
I
will
show
you
the
*NL*
only
chance
we
have
.
'
With
this
he
conducted
me
to
the
verge
of
the
*NL*
cataract
,
and
pointed
along
the
side
of
the
ravine
to
a
number
of
*NL*
curious
looking
roots
,
some
three
or
four
inches
in
thickness
,
and
*NL*
several
feet
long
,
which
,
after
twisting
among
the
fissures
of
the
rock
,
*NL*
shot
perpendicularly
from
it
and
ran
tapering
to
a
point
in
the
air
,
*NL*
hanging
over
the
gulf
like
so
many
dark
icicles
.
They
covered
nearly
*NL*
the
entire
surface
of
one
side
of
the
gorge
,
the
lowest
of
them
*NL*
reaching
even
to
the
water
.
Many
were
moss
grown
and
decayed
,
with
their
*NL*
extremities
snapped
short
off
,
and
those
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
*NL*
the
fall
were
slippery
with
moisture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
's
scheme
,
and
it
was
a
desperate
one
,
was
to
entrust
ourselves
*NL*
to
these
treacherous-looking
roots
,
and
by
slipping
down
from
one
to
*NL*
another
to
gain
the
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Are
you
ready
to
venture
it
?
'
asked
Toby
,
looking
at
me
earnestly
but
*NL*
without
saying
a
word
as
to
the
practicability
of
the
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
,
'
was
my
reply
;
for
I
saw
it
was
our
only
resource
if
we
wished
to
*NL*
advance
,
and
as
for
retreating
,
all
thoughts
of
that
sort
had
been
long
*NL*
abandoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
I
had
signified
my
assent
,
Toby
,
without
uttering
a
a
single
word
,
*NL*
crawled
along
the
dripping
ledge
until
he
gained
a
point
from
whence
*NL*
he
could
just
reach
one
of
the
largest
of
the
pendant
roots
;
he
shook
*NL*
it
--
it
quivered
in
his
grasp
,
and
when
he
let
it
go
it
twanged
in
the
*NL*
air
like
a
strong
,
wire
sharply
struck
.
Satisfied
by
his
scrutiny
,
my
*NL*
light
limbed
companion
swung
himself
nimbly
upon
it
,
and
twisting
his
*NL*
legs
round
it
in
sailor
fashion
,
slipped
down
eight
or
ten
feet
,
where
*NL*
his
weight
gave
it
a
motion
not
un-like
that
of
a
pendulum
.
He
could
not
*NL*
venture
to
descend
any
further
;
so
holding
on
with
one
hand
,
he
with
the
*NL*
other
shook
one
by
one
all
the
slender
roots
around
him
,
and
at
last
,
*NL*
finding
one
which
he
thought
trustworthy
,
shifted
him
self
to
it
and
*NL*
continued
his
downward
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
so
well
;
but
I
could
not
avoid
comparing
my
heavier
frame
and
*NL*
disabled
condition
with
his
light
figure
and
remarkable
activity
;
*NL*
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
,
and
in
less
than
a
minute
's
time
I
was
*NL*
swinging
directly
over
his
head
.
As
soon
as
his
upturned
eyes
caught
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
me
,
he
exclaimed
in
his
usual
dry
tone
,
for
the
danger
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
daunt
him
in
the
least
,
`
Mate
,
do
me
the
kindness
not
to
*NL*
fall
until
I
get
out
of
your
way
;
'
and
then
swinging
himself
more
on
*NL*
one
side
,
he
continued
his
descent
.
In
the
mean
time
I
cautiously
*NL*
transferred
myself
from
the
limb
down
which
I
had
been
slipping
to
a
*NL*
couple
of
others
that
were
near
it
,
deeming
two
strings
to
my
bow
better
*NL*
than
one
,
and
taking
care
to
test
their
strength
before
I
trusted
my
*NL*
weight
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
towards
the
end
of
the
second
stage
in
this
vertical
*NL*
journey
,
and
shaking
the
long
roots
which
were
round
me
,
to
my
*NL*
consternation
they
snapped
off
one
after
another
like
so
many
pipe
*NL*
stems
,
and
fell
in
fragments
against
the
side
of
the
gulf
,
splashing
at
*NL*
last
into
the
waters
beneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
one
after
another
the
treacherous
roots
yielded
to
my
grasp
,
and
fell
*NL*
into
the
torrent
,
my
heart
sunk
within
me
.
The
branches
on
which
I
was
*NL*
suspended
over
the
yawning
chasm
swang
to
and
fro
in
the
air
,
and
I
*NL*
expected
them
every
moment
to
snap
in
twain
.
Appalled
at
the
dreadful
*NL*
fate
that
menaced
me
,
I
clutched
frantically
at
the
only
large
root
*NL*
which
remained
near
me
,
but
in
vain
;
I
could
not
reach
it
,
though
my
*NL*
fingers
were
within
a
few
inches
of
it
.
Again
and
again
I
tried
to
reach
*NL*
it
,
until
at
length
,
maddened
with
the
thought
of
my
situation
,
I
swayed
*NL*
myself
violently
by
striking
my
foot
against
the
side
of
the
rock
,
and
*NL*
at
the
instant
that
I
approached
the
large
root
caught
desperately
at
*NL*
it
,
and
transferred
myself
to
it
.
It
vibrated
violently
under
the
sudden
*NL*
weight
,
but
fortunately
did
not
give
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
brain
grew
dizzy
with
the
idea
of
the
frightful
risk
I
had
just
run
,
*NL*
and
I
involuntarily
closed
my
eyes
to
shut
out
the
view
of
the
*NL*
depth
beneath
me
.
For
the
instant
I
was
safe
,
and
I
uttered
a
devout
*NL*
ejaculation
of
thanksgiving
for
my
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Pretty
well
done
,
'
shouted
Toby
underneath
me
;
`
you
are
nimbler
than
*NL*
I
thought
you
to
be
--
hopping
about
up
there
from
root
to
root
like
any
*NL*
young
squirrel
.
As
soon
as
you
have
diverted
yourself
sufficiently
,
I
*NL*
would
advise
you
to
proceed
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Aye
,
aye
,
Toby
,
all
in
good
time
:
two
or
three
more
such
famous
roots
*NL*
as
this
,
and
I
shall
be
with
you
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
residue
of
my
downward
progress
was
comparatively
easy
;
the
roots
*NL*
were
in
greater
abundance
,
and
in
one
or
two
places
jutting
out
points
*NL*
of
rock
assisted
me
greatly
.
In
a
few
moments
I
was
standing
by
the
side
*NL*
of
my
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Substituting
a
stout
stick
for
the
one
I
had
thrown
aside
at
the
top
of
*NL*
the
precipice
,
we
now
continued
our
course
along
the
bed
of
the
ravine
.
*NL*
Soon
we
were
saluted
by
a
sound
in
advance
,
that
grew
by
degrees
*NL*
louder
and
louder
,
as
the
noise
of
the
cataract
we
were
leaving
behind
*NL*
gradually
died
on
our
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Another
precipice
for
us
,
Toby
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Very
good
;
we
can
descend
them
,
you
know
--
come
on
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
indeed
appeared
to
depress
or
intimidate
this
intrepid
fellow
.
*NL*
Typees
or
Niagaras
,
he
was
as
ready
to
engage
one
as
the
other
,
and
I
*NL*
could
not
avoid
a
thousand
times
congratulating
myself
upon
having
such
*NL*
a
companion
in
an
enterprise
like
the
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
hour
's
painful
progress
,
we
reached
the
verge
of
another
fall
,
*NL*
still
loftier
than
the
preceding
and
flanked
both
above
and
below
with
*NL*
the
same
steep
masses
of
rock
,
presenting
,
however
,
here
and
there
*NL*
narrow
irregular
ledges
,
supporting
a
shallow
soil
,
on
which
grew
a
*NL*
variety
of
bushes
and
trees
,
whose
bright
verdure
contrasted
beautifully
*NL*
with
the
foamy
waters
that
flowed
between
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
,
who
invariably
acted
as
pioneer
,
now
proceeded
to
reconnoitre
.
*NL*
On
his
return
,
he
reported
that
the
shelves
of
rock
on
our
right
*NL*
would
enable
us
to
gain
with
little
risk
the
bottom
of
the
cataract
.
*NL*
Accordingly
,
leaving
the
bed
of
the
stream
at
the
very
point
where
it
*NL*
thundered
down
,
we
began
crawling
along
one
of
those
sloping
ledges
*NL*
until
it
carried
us
to
within
a
few
feet
of
another
that
inclined
*NL*
downwards
at
a
still
sharper
angle
,
and
upon
which
,
by
assisting
each
*NL*
other
we
managed
to
alight
in
safety
.
We
warily
crept
along
this
,
*NL*
steadying
ourselves
by
the
naked
roots
of
the
shrubs
that
clung
to
every
*NL*
fissure
.
As
we
proceeded
,
the
narrow
path
became
still
more
contracted
,
*NL*
rendering
it
difficult
for
us
to
maintain
our
footing
,
until
suddenly
,
*NL*
as
we
reached
an
angle
of
the
wall
of
rock
where
we
had
expected
it
to
*NL*
widen
,
we
perceived
to
our
consternation
that
a
yard
or
two
further
on
*NL*
it
abruptly
terminated
at
a
place
we
could
not
possibly
hope
to
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
as
usual
led
the
van
,
and
in
silence
I
waited
to
learn
from
him
how
*NL*
he
proposed
to
extricate
us
from
this
new
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
my
boy
,
'
I
exclaimed
,
after
the
expiration
of
several
minutes
,
*NL*
during
which
time
my
companion
had
not
uttered
a
word
,
`
what
's
to
be
*NL*
done
now
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
in
a
tranquil
tone
,
that
probably
the
best
thing
we
could
do
*NL*
in
our
present
strait
was
to
get
out
of
it
as
soon
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
my
dear
Toby
,
but
tell
me
how
we
are
to
get
out
of
it
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Something
in
this
sort
of
style
,
'
he
replied
,
and
at
the
same
moment
to
*NL*
my
horror
he
slipped
sideways
off
the
rocks
and
,
as
I
then
thought
,
by
*NL*
good
fortune
merely
,
alighted
among
the
spreading
branches
of
a
species
*NL*
of
palm
tree
,
that
shooting
its
hardy
roots
along
a
ledge
below
,
curved
*NL*
its
trunk
upwards
into
the
air
,
and
presented
a
thick
mass
of
foliage
*NL*
about
twenty
feet
below
the
spot
where
we
had
thus
suddenly
been
brought
*NL*
to
a
standstill
.
I
involuntarily
held
my
breath
,
expecting
to
see
the
*NL*
form
of
my
companion
,
after
being
sustained
for
a
moment
by
the
branches
*NL*
of
the
tree
,
sink
through
their
frail
support
,
and
fall
headlong
to
*NL*
the
bottom
.
To
my
surprise
and
joy
,
however
,
he
recovered
himself
,
and
*NL*
disentangling
his
limbs
from
the
fractured
branches
,
he
peered
out
from
*NL*
his
leafy
bed
,
and
shouted
lustily
,
`
Come
on
,
my
hearty
there
is
no
*NL*
other
alternative
!
'
and
with
this
he
ducked
beneath
the
foliage
,
and
*NL*
slipping
down
the
trunk
,
stood
in
a
moment
at
least
fifty
feet
beneath
*NL*
me
,
upon
the
broad
shelf
of
rock
from
which
sprung
the
tree
he
had
*NL*
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
I
not
have
given
at
that
moment
to
have
been
by
his
side
.
The
*NL*
feat
he
had
just
accomplished
seemed
little
less
than
miraculous
,
and
*NL*
I
could
hardly
credit
the
evidence
of
my
senses
when
I
saw
the
wide
*NL*
distance
that
a
single
daring
act
had
so
suddenly
placed
between
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
's
animating
`
come
on
'
again
sounded
in
my
ears
,
and
dreading
to
*NL*
lose
all
confidence
in
myself
if
I
remained
meditating
upon
the
step
,
*NL*
I
once
more
gazed
down
to
assure
myself
of
the
relative
bearing
of
the
*NL*
tree
and
my
own
position
,
and
then
closing
my
eyes
and
uttering
one
*NL*
comprehensive
ejaculation
of
prayer
,
I
inclined
myself
over
towards
the
*NL*
abyss
,
and
after
one
breathless
instant
fell
with
a
crash
into
the
tree
,
*NL*
the
branches
snapping
and
cracking
with
my
weight
,
as
I
sunk
lower
and
*NL*
lower
among
them
,
until
I
was
stopped
by
coming
in
contact
with
a
sturdy
*NL*
limb
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
moments
I
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
manipulating
*NL*
myself
all
over
with
a
view
of
ascertaining
the
extent
of
the
injuries
*NL*
I
had
received
.
To
my
surprise
the
only
effects
of
my
feat
were
a
few
*NL*
slight
contusions
too
trifling
to
care
about
.
The
rest
of
our
descent
*NL*
was
easily
accomplished
,
and
in
half
an
hour
after
regaining
the
ravine
*NL*
we
had
partaken
of
our
evening
morsel
,
built
our
hut
as
usual
,
and
*NL*
crawled
under
its
shelter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
in
spite
of
our
debility
and
the
agony
of
hunger
under
*NL*
which
we
were
now
suffering
,
though
neither
of
us
confessed
to
the
fact
,
*NL*
we
struggled
along
our
dismal
and
still
difficult
and
dangerous
path
,
*NL*
cheered
by
the
hope
of
soon
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
valley
before
*NL*
us
,
and
towards
evening
the
voice
of
a
cataract
which
had
for
some
time
*NL*
sounded
like
a
low
deep
bass
to
the
music
of
the
smaller
waterfalls
,
*NL*
broke
upon
our
ears
in
still
louder
tones
,
and
assured
us
that
we
were
*NL*
approaching
its
vicinity
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
we
stood
on
the
brink
of
a
precipice
,
over
which
the
dark
*NL*
stream
bounded
in
one
final
leap
of
full
300
feet
.
The
sheer
descent
*NL*
terminated
in
the
region
we
so
long
had
sought
.
On
each
side
of
the
*NL*
fall
,
two
lofty
and
perpendicular
bluffs
buttressed
the
sides
of
the
*NL*
enormous
cliff
,
and
projected
into
the
sea
of
verdure
with
which
the
*NL*
valley
waved
,
and
a
range
of
similar
projecting
eminences
stood
disposed
*NL*
in
a
half
circle
about
the
head
if
the
vale
.
A
thick
canopy
of
trees
*NL*
hung
over
the
very
verge
of
the
fall
,
leaving
an
arched
aperture
for
the
*NL*
passage
of
the
waters
,
which
imparted
a
strange
picturesqueness
to
the
*NL*
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
valley
was
now
before
us
;
but
instead
of
being
conducted
into
its
*NL*
smiling
bosom
by
the
gradual
descent
of
the
deep
watercourse
we
had
thus
*NL*
far
pursued
,
all
our
labours
now
appeared
to
have
been
rendered
futile
*NL*
by
its
abrupt
termination
.
But
,
bitterly
disappointed
,
we
did
not
*NL*
entirely
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
was
now
near
sunset
we
determined
to
pass
the
night
where
we
were
,
*NL*
and
on
the
morrow
,
refreshed
by
sleep
,
and
by
eating
at
one
meal
all
our
*NL*
stock
of
food
,
to
accomplish
a
descent
into
the
valley
,
or
perish
in
the
*NL*
attempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
laid
ourselves
down
that
night
on
a
spot
,
the
recollection
of
which
*NL*
still
makes
me
shudder
.
A
small
table
of
rock
which
projected
over
the
*NL*
precipice
on
one
side
of
the
stream
,
and
was
drenched
by
the
spray
*NL*
of
the
fall
,
sustained
a
huge
trunk
of
a
tree
which
must
have
been
*NL*
deposited
there
by
some
heavy
freshet
.
It
lay
obliquely
,
with
one
end
*NL*
resting
on
the
rock
and
the
other
supported
by
the
side
of
the
ravine
.
*NL*
Against
it
we
placed
in
a
sloping
direction
a
number
of
the
half
decayed
*NL*
boughs
that
were
strewn
about
,
and
covering
the
whole
with
twigs
and
*NL*
leaves
,
awaited
the
morning
's
light
beneath
such
shelter
as
it
afforded
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
of
this
night
the
continual
roaring
of
the
*NL*
cataract
--
the
dismal
moaning
of
the
gale
through
the
trees
--
the
*NL*
pattering
of
the
rain
,
and
the
profound
darkness
,
affected
my
spirits
to
*NL*
a
degree
which
nothing
had
ever
before
produced
.
Wet
,
half
famished
,
*NL*
and
chilled
to
the
heart
with
the
dampness
of
the
place
,
and
nearly
wild
*NL*
with
the
pain
I
endured
,
I
fairly
cowered
down
to
the
earth
under
*NL*
this
multiplication
of
hardships
,
and
abandoned
myself
to
frightful
*NL*
anticipations
of
evil
;
and
my
companion
,
whose
spirit
at
last
was
a
good
*NL*
deal
broken
,
scarcely
uttered
a
word
during
the
whole
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
day
dawned
upon
us
,
and
rising
from
our
miserable
pallet
,
*NL*
we
stretched
our
stiffened
joints
,
and
after
eating
all
that
remained
*NL*
of
our
bread
,
prepared
for
the
last
stage
of
our
journey
.
I
will
not
*NL*
recount
every
hair-breadth
escape
,
and
every
fearful
difficulty
that
*NL*
occurred
before
we
succeeded
in
reaching
the
bosom
of
the
valley
.
As
I
*NL*
have
already
described
similar
scenes
,
it
will
be
sufficient
to
say
that
*NL*
at
length
,
after
great
toil
and
great
dangers
,
we
both
stood
with
no
*NL*
limbs
broken
at
the
head
of
that
magnificent
vale
which
five
days
before
*NL*
had
so
suddenly
burst
upon
my
sight
,
and
almost
beneath
the
shadow
of
*NL*
those
very
cliffs
from
whose
summits
we
had
gazed
upon
the
prospect
.

at
the
hands
of
the
fiercest
of
*NL*
cannibals
,
or
a
kindly
reception
from
a
gentler
race
of
savages
?
Which
?
*NL*
But
it
was
too
late
now
to
discuss
a
question
which
would
so
soon
be
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
part
of
the
valley
in
which
we
found
ourselves
appeared
to
be
*NL*
altogether
uninhabited
.
An
almost
impenetrable
thicket
extended
*NL*
from
side
to
side
,
without
presenting
a
single
plant
affording
the
*NL*
nourishment
we
had
confidently
calculated
upon
;
and
with
this
object
,
we
*NL*
followed
the
course
of
the
stream
,
casting
quick
glances
as
we
*NL*
proceeded
into
the
thick
jungles
on
each
hand
.
My
companion
--
to
whose
*NL*
solicitations
I
had
yielded
in
descending
into
the
valley
--
now
that
*NL*
the
step
was
taken
,
began
to
manifest
a
degree
of
caution
I
had
little
*NL*
expected
from
him
.
He
proposed
that
in
the
event
of
our
finding
an
*NL*
adequate
supply
of
fruit
,
we
should
remain
in
this
unfrequented
portion
*NL*
of
the
country
--
where
we
should
run
little
chance
of
being
surprised
by
*NL*
its
occupants
,
whoever
they
might
be
--
until
sufficiently
recruited
to
*NL*
resume
our
journey
;
when
laying
a
store
of
food
equal
to
our
wants
,
we
*NL*
might
easily
regain
the
bay
of
Nukuheva
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
sufficient
*NL*
interval
to
ensure
the
departure
of
our
vessel
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
objected
strongly
to
this
proposition
,
plausible
as
it
was
,
as
the
*NL*
difficulties
of
the
route
would
be
almost
insurmountable
,
unacquainted
*NL*
as
we
were
with
the
general
bearings
of
the
country
,
and
I
reminded
*NL*
my
companion
of
the
hardships
which
we
had
already
encountered
in
our
*NL*
uncertain
wanderings
;
in
a
word
,
I
said
that
since
we
had
deemed
*NL*
it
advisable
to
enter
the
valley
,
we
ought
manfully
to
face
the
*NL*
consequences
,
whatever
they
might
be
;
the
more
especially
as
I
was
*NL*
convinced
there
was
no
alternative
left
us
but
to
fall
in
with
the
*NL*
natives
at
once
,
and
boldly
risk
the
reception
they
might
give
us
;
and
*NL*
that
as
to
myself
,
I
felt
the
necessity
of
rest
and
shelter
,
and
that
*NL*
until
I
had
obtained
them
,
I
should
be
wholly
unable
to
encounter
such
*NL*
sufferings
as
we
had
lately
passed
through
.
To
the
justice
of
these
*NL*
observations
Toby
somewhat
reluctantly
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
surprised
that
,
after
moving
as
far
as
we
had
along
the
valley
,
*NL*
we
should
still
meet
with
the
same
impervious
thickets
;
and
thinking
,
*NL*
that
although
the
borders
of
the
stream
might
be
lined
for
some
distance
*NL*
with
them
,
yet
beyond
there
might
be
more
open
ground
,
I
requested
Toby
*NL*
to
keep
a
bright
look-out
upon
one
side
,
while
I
did
the
same
on
the
*NL*
other
,
in
order
to
discover
some
opening
in
the
bushes
,
and
especially
*NL*
to
watch
for
the
slightest
appearance
of
a
path
or
anything
else
that
*NL*
might
indicate
the
vicinity
of
the
islanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
furtive
and
anxious
glances
we
cast
into
those
dim-looking
shadows
!
*NL*
With
what
apprehensions
we
proceeded
,
ignorant
at
what
moment
we
might
*NL*
be
greeted
by
the
javelin
of
some
ambushed
savage
.
At
last
my
companion
*NL*
paused
,
and
directed
my
attention
to
a
narrow
opening
in
the
foliage
.
We
*NL*
struck
into
it
,
and
it
soon
brought
us
by
an
indistinctly
traced
path
to
*NL*
a
comparatively
clear
space
,
at
the
further
end
of
which
we
descried
*NL*
a
number
of
the
trees
,
the
native
name
of
which
is
`
annuee
'
,
and
which
*NL*
bear
a
most
delicious
fruit
.
What
a
race
!
I
hobbling
over
the
ground
*NL*
like
some
decrepid
wretch
,
and
Toby
leaping
forward
like
a
greyhound
.
He
*NL*
quickly
cleared
one
of
the
trees
on
which
there
were
two
or
three
of
*NL*
the
fruit
,
but
to
our
chagrin
they
proved
to
be
much
decayed
;
the
rinds
*NL*
partly
opened
by
the
birds
,
and
their
hearts
half
devoured
.
However
,
we
*NL*
quickly
despatched
them
,
and
no
ambrosia
could
have
been
more
delicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
looked
about
us
uncertain
whither
to
direct
our
steps
,
since
the
path
*NL*
we
had
so
far
followed
appeared
to
be
lost
in
the
open
space
around
us
.
*NL*
At
last
we
resolved
to
enter
a
grove
near
at
hand
,
and
had
advanced
a
*NL*
few
rods
,
when
,
just
upon
its
skirts
,
I
picked
up
a
slender
bread-fruit
*NL*
shoot
perfectly
green
,
and
with
the
tender
bark
freshly
stripped
from
*NL*
it
.
It
was
still
slippery
with
moisture
,
and
appeared
as
if
it
had
been
*NL*
but
that
moment
thrown
aside
.
I
said
nothing
,
but
merely
held
it
up
to
*NL*
Toby
,
who
started
at
this
undeniable
evidence
of
the
vicinity
of
the
*NL*
savages
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
plot
was
now
thickening
.
--
A
short
distance
further
lay
a
little
*NL*
faggot
of
the
same
shoots
bound
together
with
a
strip
of
bark
.
Could
it
*NL*
have
been
thrown
down
by
some
solitary
native
,
who
,
alarmed
at
seeing
*NL*
us
,
had
hurried
forward
to
carry
the
tidings
of
our
approach
to
his
*NL*
countrymen
?
--
Typee
or
Happar
?
--
But
it
was
too
late
to
recede
,
so
we
*NL*
moved
on
slowly
,
my
companion
in
advance
casting
eager
glances
under
the
*NL*
trees
on
each
side
,
until
all
at
once
I
saw
him
recoil
as
if
stung
by
*NL*
an
adder
.
Sinking
on
his
knee
,
he
waved
me
off
with
one
hand
,
while
with
*NL*
the
other
he
held
aside
some
intervening
leaves
,
and
gazed
intently
at
*NL*
some
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
Disregarding
his
injunction
,
I
quickly
approached
him
and
caught
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
two
figures
partly
hidden
by
the
dense
foliage
;
they
were
*NL*
standing
close
together
,
and
were
perfectly
motionless
.
They
must
have
*NL*
previously
perceived
us
,
and
withdrawn
into
the
depths
of
the
wood
to
*NL*
elude
our
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
mind
was
at
once
made
up
.
Dropping
my
staff
,
and
tearing
open
the
*NL*
package
of
things
we
had
brought
from
the
ship
,
I
unrolled
the
cotton
*NL*
cloth
,
and
holding
it
in
one
hand
picked
with
the
other
a
twig
from
the
*NL*
bushes
beside
me
,
and
telling
Toby
to
follow
my
example
,
I
broke
through
*NL*
the
covert
and
advanced
,
waving
the
branch
in
token
of
peace
towards
*NL*
the
shrinking
forms
before
me
.
They
were
a
boy
and
a
girl
,
slender
and
*NL*
graceful
,
and
completely
naked
,
with
the
exception
of
a
slight
girdle
of
*NL*
bark
,
from
which
depended
at
opposite
points
two
of
the
russet
leaves
of
*NL*
the
bread-fruit
tree
.
An
arm
of
the
boy
,
half
screened
from
sight
by
*NL*
her
wild
tresses
,
was
thrown
about
the
neck
of
the
girl
,
while
with
the
*NL*
other
he
held
one
of
her
hands
in
his
;
and
thus
they
stood
together
,
*NL*
their
heads
inclined
forward
,
catching
the
faint
noise
we
made
in
our
*NL*
progress
,
and
with
one
foot
in
advance
,
as
if
half
inclined
to
fly
from
*NL*
our
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
drew
near
,
their
alarm
evidently
increased
.
Apprehensive
that
*NL*
they
might
fly
from
us
altogether
,
I
stopped
short
and
motioned
them
*NL*
to
advance
and
receive
the
gift
I
extended
towards
them
,
but
they
would
*NL*
not
;
I
then
uttered
a
few
words
of
their
language
with
which
I
was
*NL*
acquainted
,
scarcely
expected
that
they
would
understand
me
,
but
to
show
*NL*
that
we
had
not
dropped
from
the
clouds
upon
them
.
This
appeared
to
give
*NL*
them
a
little
confidence
,
so
I
approached
nearer
,
presenting
the
cloth
*NL*
with
one
hand
,
and
holding
the
bough
with
the
other
,
while
they
slowly
*NL*
retreated
.
At
last
they
suffered
us
to
approach
so
near
to
them
that
we
*NL*
were
enabled
to
throw
the
cotton
cloth
across
their
shoulders
,
giving
*NL*
them
to
understand
that
it
was
theirs
,
and
by
a
variety
of
gestures
*NL*
endeavouring
to
make
them
understand
that
we
entertained
the
highest
*NL*
possible
regard
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
frightened
pair
now
stood
still
,
whilst
we
endeavoured
to
make
them
*NL*
comprehend
the
nature
of
our
wants
.
In
doing
this
Toby
went
through
with
*NL*
a
complete
series
of
pantomimic
illustrations
--
opening
his
mouth
from
*NL*
ear
to
ear
,
and
thrusting
his
fingers
down
his
throat
,
gnashing
his
*NL*
teeth
and
rolling
his
eyes
about
,
till
I
verily
believe
the
poor
*NL*
creatures
took
us
for
a
couple
of
white
cannibals
who
were
about
to
*NL*
make
a
meal
of
them
.
When
,
however
,
they
understood
us
,
they
showed
*NL*
no
inclination
to
relieve
our
wants
.
At
this
juncture
it
began
to
rain
*NL*
violently
,
and
we
motioned
them
to
lead
us
to
some
place
of
shelter
.
*NL*
With
this
request
they
appeared
willing
to
comply
,
but
nothing
could
*NL*
evince
more
strongly
the
apprehension
with
which
they
regarded
us
,
*NL*
than
the
way
in
which
,
whilst
walking
before
us
,
they
kept
their
eyes
*NL*
constantly
turned
back
to
watch
every
movement
we
made
,
and
even
our
*NL*
very
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Typee
or
Happar
,
Toby
?
'
asked
I
as
we
walked
after
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
Happar
,
'
he
replied
,
with
a
show
of
confidence
which
was
*NL*
intended
to
disguise
his
doubts
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
shall
soon
know
,
'
I
exclaimed
;
and
at
the
same
moment
I
*NL*
stepped
forward
towards
our
guides
,
and
pronouncing
the
two
names
*NL*
interrogatively
and
pointing
to
the
lowest
part
of
the
valley
,
*NL*
endeavoured
to
come
to
the
point
at
once
.
They
repeated
the
words
after
*NL*
me
again
and
again
,
but
without
giving
any
peculiar
emphasis
to
either
,
*NL*
so
that
I
was
completely
at
a
loss
to
understand
them
;
for
a
couple
of
*NL*
wilier
young
things
than
we
afterwards
found
them
to
have
been
on
this
*NL*
particular
occasion
never
probably
fell
in
any
traveller
's
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
and
more
curious
to
ascertain
our
fate
,
I
now
threw
together
in
the
*NL*
form
of
a
question
the
words
`
Happar
'
and
`
Motarkee
'
,
the
latter
being
*NL*
equivalent
to
the
word
`
good
'
.
The
two
natives
interchanged
glances
*NL*
of
peculiar
meaning
with
one
another
at
this
,
and
manifested
no
little
*NL*
surprise
;
but
on
the
repetition
of
the
question
after
some
consultation
*NL*
together
,
to
the
great
joy
of
Toby
,
they
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
*NL*
Toby
was
now
in
ecstasies
,
especially
as
the
young
savages
continued
*NL*
to
reiterate
their
answer
with
great
energy
,
as
though
desirous
of
*NL*
impressing
us
with
the
idea
that
being
among
the
Happars
,
we
ought
to
*NL*
consider
ourselves
perfectly
secure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
had
some
lingering
doubts
,
I
feigned
great
delight
with
Toby
*NL*
at
this
announcement
,
while
my
companion
broke
out
into
a
pantomimic
*NL*
abhorrence
of
Typee
,
and
immeasurable
love
for
the
particular
valley
in
*NL*
which
we
were
;
our
guides
all
the
while
gazing
uneasily
at
one
another
*NL*
as
if
at
a
loss
to
account
for
our
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
hurried
on
,
and
we
followed
them
;
until
suddenly
they
set
up
a
*NL*
strange
halloo
,
which
was
answered
from
beyond
the
grove
through
which
*NL*
we
were
passing
,
and
the
next
moment
we
entered
upon
some
open
ground
,
*NL*
at
the
extremity
of
which
we
descried
a
long
,
low
hut
,
and
in
front
of
*NL*
it
were
several
young
girls
.
As
soon
as
they
perceived
us
they
fled
with
*NL*
wild
screams
into
the
adjoining
thickets
,
like
so
many
startled
fawns
.
*NL*
A
few
moments
after
the
whole
valley
resounded
with
savage
outcries
,
and
*NL*
the
natives
came
running
towards
us
from
every
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
an
army
of
invaders
made
an
irruption
into
their
territory
they
*NL*
could
not
have
evinced
greater
excitement
.
We
were
soon
completely
*NL*
encircled
by
a
dense
throng
,
and
in
their
eager
desire
to
behold
us
they
*NL*
almost
arrested
our
progress
;
an
equal
number
surrounded
our
youthful
*NL*
guides
,
who
with
amazing
volubility
appeared
to
be
detailing
the
*NL*
circumstances
which
had
attended
their
meeting
with
us
.
Every
item
of
*NL*
intelligence
appeared
to
redouble
the
astonishment
of
the
islanders
,
and
*NL*
they
gazed
at
us
with
inquiring
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
we
reached
a
large
and
handsome
building
of
bamboos
,
and
were
by
*NL*
signs
told
to
enter
it
,
the
natives
opening
a
lane
for
us
through
which
*NL*
to
pass
;
on
entering
without
ceremony
,
we
threw
our
exhausted
frames
*NL*
upon
the
mats
that
covered
the
floor
.
In
a
moment
the
slight
tenement
*NL*
was
completely
full
of
people
,
whilst
those
who
were
unable
to
obtain
*NL*
admittance
gazed
at
us
through
its
open
cane-work
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
evening
,
and
by
the
dim
light
we
could
just
discern
the
*NL*
savage
countenances
around
us
,
gleaming
with
wild
curiosity
and
wonder
;
*NL*
the
naked
forms
and
tattooed
limbs
of
brawny
warriors
,
with
here
and
*NL*
there
the
slighter
figures
of
young
girls
,
all
engaged
in
a
perfect
*NL*
storm
of
conversation
,
of
which
we
were
of
course
the
one
only
*NL*
theme
,
whilst
our
recent
guides
were
fully
occupied
in
answering
the
*NL*
innumerable
questions
which
every
one
put
to
them
.
Nothing
can
exceed
*NL*
the
fierce
gesticulation
of
these
people
when
animated
in
conversation
,
*NL*
and
on
this
occasion
they
gave
loose
to
all
their
natural
vivacity
,
*NL*
shouting
and
dancing
about
in
a
manner
that
well
nigh
intimidated
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Close
to
where
we
lay
,
squatting
upon
their
haunches
,
were
some
eight
or
*NL*
ten
noble-looking
chiefs
--
for
such
they
subsequently
proved
to
be
--
who
,
*NL*
more
reserved
than
the
rest
,
regarded
us
with
a
fixed
and
stern
*NL*
attention
,
which
not
a
little
discomposed
our
equanimity
.
One
of
them
*NL*
in
particular
,
who
appeared
to
be
the
highest
in
rank
,
placed
himself
*NL*
directly
facing
me
,
looking
at
me
with
a
rigidity
of
aspect
under
which
*NL*
I
absolutely
quailed
.
He
never
once
opened
his
lips
,
but
maintained
his
*NL*
severe
expression
of
countenance
,
without
turning
his
face
aside
for
*NL*
a
single
moment
.
Never
before
had
I
been
subjected
to
so
strange
and
*NL*
steady
a
glance
;
it
revealed
nothing
of
the
mind
of
the
savage
,
but
it
*NL*
appeared
to
be
reading
my
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
undergoing
this
scrutiny
till
I
grew
absolutely
nervous
,
with
a
*NL*
view
of
diverting
it
if
possible
,
and
conciliating
the
good
opinion
of
*NL*
the
warrior
,
I
took
some
tobacco
from
the
bosom
of
my
frock
and
*NL*
offered
it
to
him
.
He
quietly
rejected
the
proffered
gift
,
and
,
without
*NL*
speaking
,
motioned
me
to
return
it
to
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
previous
intercourse
with
the
natives
of
Nukuheva
and
Tior
,
I
had
*NL*
found
that
the
present
of
a
small
piece
of
tobacco
would
have
rendered
*NL*
any
of
them
devoted
to
my
service
.
Was
this
act
of
the
chief
a
token
of
*NL*
his
enmity
?
Typee
or
Happar
?
I
asked
within
myself
.
I
started
,
for
at
*NL*
the
same
moment
this
identical
question
was
asked
by
the
strange
being
*NL*
before
me
.
I
turned
to
Toby
,
the
flickering
light
of
a
native
taper
*NL*
showed
me
his
countenance
pale
with
trepidation
at
this
fatal
question
.
*NL*
I
paused
for
a
second
,
and
I
know
not
by
what
impulse
it
was
that
I
*NL*
answered
`
Typee
'
.
The
piece
of
dusky
statuary
nodded
in
approval
,
and
*NL*
then
murmured
`
Motarkee
!
'
`
Motarkee
,
'
said
I
,
without
further
hesitation
*NL*
`
Typee
motarkee
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
transition
!
The
dark
figures
around
us
leaped
to
their
feet
,
*NL*
clapped
their
hands
in
transport
,
and
shouted
again
and
again
the
*NL*
talismanic
syllables
,
the
utterance
of
which
appeared
to
have
settled
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
commotion
had
a
little
subsided
,
the
principal
chief
squatted
*NL*
once
more
before
me
,
and
throwing
himself
into
a
sudden
rage
,
poured
*NL*
forth
a
string
of
philippics
,
which
I
was
at
no
loss
to
understand
,
from
*NL*
the
frequent
recurrence
of
the
word
Happar
,
as
being
directed
against
*NL*
the
natives
of
the
adjoining
valley
.
In
all
these
denunciations
my
*NL*
companion
and
I
acquiesced
,
while
we
extolled
the
character
of
the
*NL*
warlike
Typees
.
To
be
sure
our
panegyrics
were
somewhat
laconic
,
*NL*
consisting
in
the
repetition
of
that
name
,
united
with
the
potent
*NL*
adjective
`
motarkee
'
.
But
this
was
sufficient
,
and
served
to
conciliate
*NL*
the
good
will
of
the
natives
,
with
whom
our
congeniality
of
sentiment
on
*NL*
this
point
did
more
towards
inspiring
a
friendly
feeling
than
anything
*NL*
else
that
could
have
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
wrath
of
the
chief
evaporated
,
and
in
a
few
moments
he
*NL*
was
as
placid
as
ever
.
Laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
he
gave
me
to
*NL*
understand
that
his
name
was
`
Mehevi
'
,
and
that
,
in
return
,
he
wished
me
*NL*
to
communicate
my
appellation
.
I
hesitated
for
an
instant
,
thinking
that
*NL*
it
might
be
difficult
for
him
to
pronounce
my
real
name
,
and
then
with
*NL*
the
most
praiseworthy
intentions
intimated
that
I
was
known
as
`
Tom
'
.
*NL*
But
I
could
not
have
made
a
worse
selection
;
the
chief
could
not
master
*NL*
it
.
`
Tommo
,
'
`
Tomma
'
,
`
Tommee
'
,
everything
but
plain
`
Tom
'
.
As
he
*NL*
persisted
in
garnishing
the
word
with
an
additional
syllable
,
I
*NL*
compromised
the
matter
with
him
at
the
word
`
Tommo
'
;
and
by
that
name
*NL*
I
went
during
the
entire
period
of
my
stay
in
the
valley
.
The
same
*NL*
proceeding
was
gone
through
with
Toby
,
whose
mellifluous
appellation
was
*NL*
more
easily
caught
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
exchange
of
names
is
equivalent
to
a
ratification
of
good
will
and
*NL*
amity
among
these
simple
people
;
and
as
we
were
aware
of
this
fact
,
we
*NL*
were
delighted
that
it
had
taken
place
on
the
present
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reclining
upon
our
mats
,
we
now
held
a
kind
of
levee
,
giving
audience
*NL*
to
successive
troops
of
the
natives
,
who
introduced
themselves
to
us
by
*NL*
pronouncing
their
respective
names
,
and
retired
in
high
good
humour
on
*NL*
receiving
ours
in
return
.
During
this
ceremony
the
greatest
merriment
*NL*
prevailed
nearly
every
announcement
on
the
part
of
the
islanders
being
*NL*
followed
by
a
fresh
sally
of
gaiety
,
which
induced
me
to
believe
that
*NL*
some
of
them
at
least
were
innocently
diverting
the
company
at
our
*NL*
expense
,
by
bestowing
upon
themselves
a
string
of
absurd
titles
,
of
the
*NL*
humour
of
which
we
were
of
course
entirely
ignorant
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
occupied
about
an
hour
,
when
the
throng
having
a
little
*NL*
diminished
,
I
turned
to
Mehevi
and
gave
him
to
understand
that
we
were
*NL*
in
need
of
food
and
sleep
.
Immediately
the
attentive
chief
addressed
a
*NL*
few
words
to
one
of
the
crowd
,
who
disappeared
,
and
returned
in
a
few
*NL*
moments
with
a
calabash
of
`
poee-poee
'
,
and
two
or
three
young
cocoanuts
*NL*
stripped
of
their
husks
,
and
with
their
shells
partly
broken
.
We
both
*NL*
of
us
forthwith
placed
one
of
these
natural
goblets
to
our
lips
,
and
*NL*
drained
it
in
a
moment
of
the
refreshing
draught
it
contained
.
The
*NL*
poee-poee
was
then
placed
before
us
,
and
even
famished
as
I
was
,
I
*NL*
paused
to
consider
in
what
manner
to
convey
it
to
my
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
staple
article
of
food
among
the
Marquese
islanders
is
manufactured
*NL*
from
the
produce
of
the
bread-fruit
tree
.
It
somewhat
resembles
in
*NL*
its
plastic
nature
our
bookbinders
'
paste
,
is
of
a
yellow
colour
,
and
*NL*
somewhat
tart
to
the
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
dish
,
the
merits
of
which
I
was
now
eager
to
discuss
.
I
*NL*
eyed
it
wistfully
for
a
moment
,
and
then
,
unable
any
longer
to
stand
on
*NL*
ceremony
,
plunged
my
hand
into
the
yielding
mass
,
and
to
the
boisterous
*NL*
mirth
of
the
natives
drew
it
forth
laden
with
the
poee-poee
,
which
*NL*
adhered
in
lengthy
strings
to
every
finger
.
So
stubborn
was
its
*NL*
consistency
,
that
in
conveying
my
heavily-weighted
hand
to
my
mouth
,
the
*NL*
connecting
links
almost
raised
the
calabash
from
the
mats
on
which
it
*NL*
had
been
placed
.
This
display
of
awkwardness
--
in
which
,
by-the-bye
,
Toby
*NL*
kept
me
company
--
convulsed
the
bystanders
with
uncontrollable
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
their
merriment
had
somewhat
subsided
,
Mehevi
,
motioning
us
*NL*
to
be
attentive
,
dipped
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
in
the
dish
,
*NL*
and
giving
it
a
rapid
and
scientific
twirl
,
drew
it
out
coated
smoothly
*NL*
with
the
preparation
.
With
a
second
peculiar
flourish
he
prevented
the
*NL*
poee-poee
from
dropping
to
the
ground
as
he
raised
it
to
his
mouth
,
into
*NL*
which
the
finger
was
inserted
and
drawn
forth
perfectly
free
from
any
*NL*
adhesive
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
performance
was
evidently
intended
for
our
instruction
;
so
I
*NL*
again
essayed
the
feat
on
the
principles
inculcated
,
but
with
very
ill
*NL*
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
starving
man
,
however
,
little
heeds
conventional
proprieties
,
*NL*
especially
on
a
South-Sea
Island
,
and
accordingly
Toby
and
I
partook
of
*NL*
the
dish
after
our
own
clumsy
fashion
,
beplastering
our
faces
all
over
*NL*
with
the
glutinous
compound
,
and
daubing
our
hands
nearly
to
the
*NL*
wrist
.
This
kind
of
food
is
by
no
means
disagreeable
to
the
palate
of
a
*NL*
European
,
though
at
first
the
mode
of
eating
it
may
be
.
For
my
own
*NL*
part
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
days
I
became
accustomed
to
its
singular
*NL*
flavour
,
and
grew
remarkably
fond
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
for
the
first
course
;
several
other
dishes
followed
it
,
some
of
*NL*
which
were
positively
delicious
.
We
concluded
our
banquet
by
tossing
*NL*
off
the
contents
of
two
more
young
cocoanuts
,
after
which
we
regaled
*NL*
ourselves
with
the
soothing
fumes
of
tobacco
,
inhaled
from
a
quaintly
*NL*
carved
pipe
which
passed
round
the
circle
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
repast
,
the
natives
eyed
us
with
intense
curiosity
,
observing
*NL*
our
minutest
motions
,
and
appearing
to
discover
abundant
matter
for
*NL*
comment
in
the
most
trifling
occurrence
.
Their
surprise
mounted
the
*NL*
highest
,
when
we
began
to
remove
our
uncomfortable
garments
,
which
were
*NL*
saturated
with
rain
.
They
scanned
the
whiteness
of
our
limbs
,
and
seemed
*NL*
utterly
unable
to
account
for
the
contrast
they
presented
to
the
swarthy
*NL*
hue
of
our
faces
embrowned
from
a
six
months
'
exposure
to
the
scorching
*NL*
sun
of
the
Line
.
They
felt
our
skin
,
much
in
the
same
way
that
a
silk
*NL*
mercer
would
handle
a
remarkably
fine
piece
of
satin
;
and
some
of
them
*NL*
went
so
far
in
their
investigation
as
to
apply
the
olfactory
organ
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
singular
behaviour
almost
led
me
to
imagine
that
they
never
before
*NL*
had
beheld
a
white
man
;
but
a
few
moments
'
reflection
convinced
me
that
*NL*
this
could
not
have
been
the
case
;
and
a
more
satisfactory
reason
for
*NL*
their
conduct
has
since
suggested
itself
to
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Deterred
by
the
frightful
stories
related
of
its
inhabitants
,
ships
*NL*
never
enter
this
bay
,
while
their
hostile
relations
with
the
tribes
in
*NL*
the
adjoining
valleys
prevent
the
Typees
from
visiting
that
section
of
*NL*
the
island
where
vessels
occasionally
lie
.
At
long
intervals
,
however
,
*NL*
some
intrepid
captain
will
touch
on
the
skirts
of
the
bay
,
with
two
or
*NL*
three
armed
boats
'
crews
and
accompanied
by
interpreters
.
The
natives
*NL*
who
live
near
the
sea
descry
the
strangers
long
before
they
reach
their
*NL*
waters
,
and
aware
of
the
purpose
for
which
they
come
,
proclaim
loudly
*NL*
the
news
of
their
approach
.
By
a
species
of
vocal
telegraph
the
*NL*
intelligence
reaches
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
vale
in
an
inconceivably
*NL*
short
space
of
time
,
drawing
nearly
its
whole
population
down
to
*NL*
the
beach
laden
with
every
variety
of
fruit
.
The
interpreter
,
who
is
*NL*
invariably
a
`
tabooed
Kanaka
'
*
,
leaps
ashore
with
the
goods
intended
for
*NL*
barter
,
while
the
boats
,
with
their
oars
shipped
,
and
every
man
on
his
*NL*
thwart
,
lie
just
outside
the
surf
,
heading
off
the
shore
,
in
readiness
*NL*
at
the
first
untoward
event
to
escape
to
the
open
sea
.
As
soon
as
the
*NL*
traffic
is
concluded
,
one
of
the
boats
pulls
in
under
cover
of
the
*NL*
muskets
of
the
others
,
the
fruit
is
quickly
thrown
into
her
,
and
the
*NL*
transient
visitors
precipitately
retire
from
what
they
justly
consider
*NL*
so
dangerous
a
vicinity
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
word
`
Kanaka
'
is
at
the
present
day
universally
used
in
the
South
*NL*
Seas
by
Europeans
to
designate
the
Islanders
.
In
the
various
dialects
*NL*
of
the
principal
groups
it
is
simply
a
sexual
designation
applied
to
*NL*
the
males
;
but
it
is
now
used
by
the
natives
in
their
intercourse
with
*NL*
foreigners
in
the
same
sense
in
which
the
latter
employ
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
`
Tabooed
Kanaka
'
is
an
islander
whose
person
has
been
made
to
a
*NL*
certain
extent
sacred
by
the
operation
of
a
singular
custom
hereafter
to
*NL*
be
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
intercourse
occurring
with
Europeans
being
so
restricted
,
no
wonder
*NL*
that
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
manifested
so
much
curiosity
with
*NL*
regard
to
us
,
appearing
as
we
did
among
them
under
such
singular
*NL*
circumstances
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
we
were
the
first
white
men
who
ever
*NL*
penetrated
thus
far
back
into
their
territories
,
or
at
least
the
first
*NL*
who
had
ever
descended
from
the
head
of
the
vale
.
What
had
brought
us
*NL*
thither
must
have
appeared
a
complete
mystery
to
them
,
and
from
our
*NL*
ignorance
of
the
language
it
was
impossible
for
us
to
enlighten
them
.
In
*NL*
answer
to
inquiries
which
the
eloquence
of
their
gestures
enabled
us
to
*NL*
comprehend
,
all
that
we
could
reply
was
,
that
we
had
come
from
Nukuheva
,
*NL*
a
place
,
be
it
remembered
,
with
which
they
were
at
open
war
.
This
*NL*
intelligence
appeared
to
affect
them
with
the
most
lively
emotions
.
*NL*
`
Nukuheva
motarkee
?
'
they
asked
.
Of
course
we
replied
most
energetically
*NL*
in
the
negative
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
plied
us
with
a
thousand
questions
,
of
which
we
could
*NL*
understand
nothing
more
than
that
they
had
reference
to
the
recent
*NL*
movements
of
the
French
,
against
whom
they
seemed
to
cherish
the
most
*NL*
fierce
hatred
.
So
eager
were
they
to
obtain
information
on
this
point
,
*NL*
that
they
still
continued
to
propound
their
queries
long
after
we
had
*NL*
shown
that
we
were
utterly
unable
to
answer
them
.
Occasionally
we
caught
*NL*
some
indistinct
idea
of
their
meaning
,
when
we
would
endeavour
by
every
*NL*
method
in
our
power
to
communicate
the
desired
intelligence
.
At
such
*NL*
times
their
gratification
was
boundless
,
and
they
would
redouble
their
*NL*
efforts
to
make
us
comprehend
them
more
perfectly
.
But
all
in
vain
;
and
*NL*
in
the
end
they
looked
at
us
despairingly
,
as
if
we
were
the
receptacles
*NL*
of
invaluable
information
;
but
how
to
come
at
it
they
knew
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
the
group
around
us
gradually
dispersed
,
and
we
were
*NL*
left
about
midnight
-LRB-
as
we
conjectured
-RRB-
with
those
who
appeared
to
be
*NL*
permanent
residents
of
the
house
.
These
individuals
now
provided
us
with
*NL*
fresh
mats
to
lie
upon
,
covered
us
with
several
folds
of
tappa
,
and
then
*NL*
extinguishing
the
tapers
that
had
been
burning
,
threw
themselves
down
*NL*
beside
us
,
and
after
a
little
desultory
conversation
were
soon
sound
*NL*
asleep

VARIOUS
and
conflicting
were
the
thoughts
which
oppressed
me
during
the
*NL*
silent
hours
that
followed
the
events
related
in
the
preceding
chapter
.
*NL*
Toby
,
wearied
with
the
fatigues
of
the
day
,
slumbered
heavily
by
my
*NL*
side
;
but
the
pain
under
which
I
was
suffering
effectually
prevented
*NL*
my
sleeping
,
and
I
remained
distressingly
alive
to
all
the
fearful
*NL*
circumstances
of
our
present
situation
.
Was
it
possible
that
,
after
all
*NL*
our
vicissitudes
,
we
were
really
in
the
terrible
valley
of
Typee
,
and
*NL*
at
the
mercy
of
its
inmates
,
a
fierce
and
unrelenting
tribe
of
savages
?
*NL*
Typee
or
Happar
?
I
shuddered
when
I
reflected
that
there
was
no
longer
*NL*
any
room
for
doubt
;
and
that
,
beyond
all
hope
of
escape
,
we
were
now
*NL*
placed
in
those
very
circumstances
from
the
bare
thought
of
which
I
had
*NL*
recoiled
with
such
abhorrence
but
a
few
days
before
.
What
might
not
*NL*
be
our
fearful
destiny
?
To
be
sure
,
as
yet
we
had
been
treated
with
no
*NL*
violence
;
nay
,
had
been
even
kindly
and
hospitably
entertained
.
But
what
*NL*
dependence
could
be
placed
upon
the
fickle
passions
which
sway
the
bosom
*NL*
of
a
savage
?
His
inconstancy
and
treachery
are
proverbial
.
Might
it
*NL*
not
be
that
beneath
these
fair
appearances
the
islanders
covered
some
*NL*
perfidious
design
,
and
that
their
friendly
reception
of
us
might
only
*NL*
precede
some
horrible
catastrophe
?
How
strongly
did
these
forebodings
*NL*
spring
up
in
my
mind
as
I
lay
restlessly
upon
a
couch
of
mats
surrounded
*NL*
by
the
dimly
revealed
forms
of
those
whom
I
so
greatly
dreaded
!
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
excitement
of
these
fearful
thoughts
I
sank
towards
morning
*NL*
into
an
uneasy
slumber
;
and
on
awaking
,
with
a
start
,
in
the
midst
of
an
*NL*
appalling
dream
,
looked
up
into
the
eager
countenance
of
a
number
of
the
*NL*
natives
,
who
were
bending
over
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
broad
day
;
and
the
house
was
nearly
filled
with
young
females
,
*NL*
fancifully
decorated
with
flowers
,
who
gazed
upon
me
as
I
rose
with
*NL*
faces
in
which
childish
delight
and
curiosity
were
vividly
portrayed
.
*NL*
After
waking
Toby
,
they
seated
themselves
round
us
on
the
mats
,
and
gave
*NL*
full
play
to
that
prying
inquisitiveness
which
time
out
of
mind
has
been
*NL*
attributed
to
the
adorable
sex
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
these
unsophisticated
young
creatures
were
attended
by
no
jealous
*NL*
duennas
,
their
proceedings
were
altogether
informal
,
and
void
of
*NL*
artificial
restraint
.
Long
and
minute
was
the
investigation
with
which
*NL*
they
honoured
us
,
and
so
uproarious
their
mirth
,
that
I
felt
infinitely
*NL*
sheepish
;
and
Toby
was
immeasurably
outraged
at
their
familiarity
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
lively
young
ladies
were
at
the
same
time
wonderfully
polite
*NL*
and
humane
;
fanning
aside
the
insects
that
occasionally
lighted
on
our
*NL*
brows
;
presenting
us
with
food
;
and
compassionately
regarding
me
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
my
afflictions
.
But
in
spite
of
all
their
blandishments
,
my
*NL*
feelings
of
propriety
were
exceedingly
shocked
,
for
I
could
but
consider
*NL*
them
as
having
overstepped
the
due
limits
of
female
decorum
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
diverted
themselves
to
their
hearts
'
content
,
our
young
visitants
*NL*
now
withdrew
,
and
gave
place
to
successive
troops
of
the
other
sex
,
who
*NL*
continued
flocking
towards
the
house
until
near
noon
;
by
which
time
I
*NL*
have
no
doubt
that
the
greater
part
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
had
*NL*
bathed
themselves
in
the
light
of
our
benignant
countenances
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
when
their
numbers
began
to
diminish
,
a
superb-looking
warrior
*NL*
stooped
the
towering
plumes
of
his
head-dress
beneath
the
low
portal
,
*NL*
and
entered
the
house
.
I
saw
at
once
that
he
was
some
distinguished
*NL*
personage
,
the
natives
regarding
him
with
the
utmost
deference
,
and
*NL*
making
room
for
him
as
he
approached
.
His
aspect
was
imposing
.
The
*NL*
splendid
long
drooping
tail-feathers
of
the
tropical
bird
,
thickly
*NL*
interspersed
with
the
gaudy
plumage
of
the
cock
,
were
disposed
in
an
*NL*
immense
upright
semicircle
upon
his
head
,
their
lower
extremities
being
*NL*
fixed
in
a
crescent
of
guinea-heads
which
spanned
the
forehead
.
Around
*NL*
his
neck
were
several
enormous
necklaces
of
boar
's
tusks
,
polished
like
*NL*
ivory
,
and
disposed
in
such
a
manner
as
that
the
longest
and
largest
*NL*
were
upon
his
capacious
chest
.
Thrust
forward
through
the
large
*NL*
apertures
in
his
ears
were
two
small
and
finely-shaped
sperm
whale
*NL*
teeth
,
presenting
their
cavities
in
front
,
stuffed
with
freshly-plucked
*NL*
leaves
,
and
curiously
wrought
at
the
other
end
into
strange
little
*NL*
images
and
devices
.
These
barbaric
trinkets
,
garnished
in
this
manner
at
*NL*
their
open
extremities
,
and
tapering
and
curving
round
to
a
point
behind
*NL*
the
ear
,
resembled
not
a
little
a
pair
of
cornucopias
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
loins
of
the
warrior
were
girt
about
with
heavy
folds
of
a
*NL*
dark-coloured
tappa
,
hanging
before
and
behind
in
clusters
of
braided
*NL*
tassels
,
while
anklets
and
bracelets
of
curling
human
hair
completed
*NL*
his
unique
costume
.
In
his
right
hand
he
grasped
a
beautifully
carved
*NL*
paddle-spear
,
nearly
fifteen
feet
in
length
,
made
of
the
bright
*NL*
koar-wood
,
one
end
sharply
pointed
,
and
the
other
flattened
like
an
*NL*
oar-blade
.
Hanging
obliquely
from
his
girdle
by
a
loop
of
sinnate
was
*NL*
a
richly
decorated
pipe
;
the
slender
reed
forming
its
stem
was
coloured
*NL*
with
a
red
pigment
,
and
round
it
,
as
well
as
the
idol-bowl
,
fluttered
*NL*
little
streamers
of
the
thinnest
tappa
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
which
was
most
remarkable
in
the
appearance
of
this
splendid
*NL*
islander
was
the
elaborate
tattooing
displayed
on
every
noble
limb
.
All
*NL*
imaginable
lines
and
curves
and
figures
were
delineated
over
his
whole
*NL*
body
,
and
in
their
grotesque
variety
and
infinite
profusion
I
could
only
*NL*
compare
them
to
the
crowded
groupings
of
quaint
patterns
we
sometimes
*NL*
see
in
costly
pieces
of
lacework
.
The
most
simple
and
remarkable
of
all
*NL*
these
ornaments
was
that
which
decorated
the
countenance
of
the
chief
.
*NL*
Two
broad
stripes
of
tattooing
,
diverging
from
the
centre
of
his
shaven
*NL*
crown
,
obliquely
crossed
both
eyes
--
staining
the
lids
--
to
a
little
*NL*
below
each
ear
,
where
they
united
with
another
stripe
which
swept
in
a
*NL*
straight
line
along
the
lips
and
formed
the
base
of
the
triangle
.
*NL*
The
warrior
,
from
the
excellence
of
his
physical
proportions
,
might
*NL*
certainly
have
been
regarded
as
one
of
Nature
's
noblemen
,
and
the
lines
*NL*
drawn
upon
his
face
may
possibly
have
denoted
his
exalted
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
warlike
personage
,
upon
entering
the
house
,
seated
himself
at
some
*NL*
distance
from
the
spot
where
Toby
and
myself
reposed
,
while
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
savages
looked
alternately
from
us
to
him
,
as
if
in
expectation
of
*NL*
something
they
were
disappointed
in
not
perceiving
.
Regarding
the
chief
*NL*
attentively
,
I
thought
his
lineaments
appeared
familiar
to
me
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
his
full
face
was
turned
upon
me
,
and
I
again
beheld
its
*NL*
extraordinary
embellishment
,
and
met
the
strange
gaze
to
which
I
had
*NL*
been
subjected
the
preceding
night
,
I
immediately
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
alteration
in
his
appearance
,
recognized
the
noble
Mehevi
.
On
addressing
*NL*
him
,
he
advanced
at
once
in
the
most
cordial
manner
,
and
greeting
me
*NL*
warmly
,
seemed
to
enjoy
not
a
little
the
effect
his
barbaric
costume
had
*NL*
produced
upon
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
forthwith
determined
to
secure
,
if
possible
,
the
good-will
of
this
*NL*
individual
,
as
I
easily
perceived
he
was
a
man
of
great
authority
in
his
*NL*
tribe
,
and
one
who
might
exert
a
powerful
influence
upon
our
subsequent
*NL*
fate
.
In
the
endeavour
I
was
not
repulsed
;
for
nothing
could
surpass
*NL*
the
friendliness
he
manifested
towards
both
my
companion
and
myself
.
*NL*
He
extended
his
sturdy
limbs
by
our
side
,
and
endeavoured
to
make
*NL*
us
comprehend
the
full
extent
of
the
kindly
feelings
by
which
he
was
*NL*
actuated
.
The
almost
insuperable
difficulty
in
communicating
to
one
*NL*
another
our
ideas
affected
the
chief
with
no
little
mortification
.
He
*NL*
evinced
a
great
desire
to
be
enlightened
with
regard
to
the
customs
and
*NL*
peculiarities
of
the
far-off
country
we
had
left
behind
us
,
and
to
which
*NL*
under
the
name
of
Maneeka
he
frequently
alluded
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
which
more
than
any
other
subject
engaged
his
attention
was
*NL*
the
late
proceedings
of
the
`
Frannee
'
as
he
called
the
French
,
in
the
*NL*
neighbouring
bay
of
Nukuheva
.
This
seemed
a
never-ending
theme
with
him
,
*NL*
and
one
concerning
which
he
was
never
weary
of
interrogating
us
.
All
the
*NL*
information
we
succeeded
in
imparting
to
him
on
this
subject
was
little
*NL*
more
than
that
we
had
seen
six
men-of-war
lying
in
the
hostile
bay
at
*NL*
the
time
we
had
left
it
.
When
he
received
this
intelligence
,
Mehevi
,
by
*NL*
the
aid
of
his
fingers
,
went
through
a
long
numerical
calculation
,
as
if
*NL*
estimating
the
number
of
Frenchmen
the
squadron
might
contain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
just
after
employing
his
faculties
in
this
way
that
he
happened
*NL*
to
notice
the
swelling
in
my
limb
.
He
immediately
examined
it
with
the
*NL*
utmost
attention
,
and
after
doing
so
,
despatched
a
boy
who
happened
to
*NL*
be
standing
by
with
some
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
lapse
of
a
few
moments
the
stripling
re-entered
the
house
with
*NL*
an
aged
islander
,
who
might
have
been
taken
for
old
Hippocrates
himself
.
*NL*
His
head
was
as
bald
as
the
polished
surface
of
a
cocoanut
shell
,
which
*NL*
article
it
precisely
resembled
in
smoothness
and
colour
,
while
a
long
*NL*
silvery
beard
swept
almost
to
his
girdle
of
bark
.
Encircling
his
temples
*NL*
was
a
bandeau
of
the
twisted
leaves
of
the
Omoo
tree
,
pressed
closely
*NL*
over
the
brows
to
shield
his
feeble
vision
from
the
glare
of
the
sun
.
*NL*
His
tottering
steps
were
supported
by
a
long
slim
staff
,
resembling
the
*NL*
wand
with
which
a
theatrical
magician
appears
on
the
stage
,
and
in
*NL*
one
hand
he
carried
a
freshly
plaited
fan
of
the
green
leaflets
of
the
*NL*
cocoanut
tree
.
A
flowing
robe
of
tappa
,
knotted
over
the
shoulder
,
hung
*NL*
loosely
round
his
stooping
form
,
and
heightened
the
venerableness
of
his
*NL*
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mehevi
,
saluting
this
old
gentleman
,
motioned
him
to
a
seat
between
us
,
*NL*
and
then
uncovering
my
limb
,
desired
him
to
examine
it
.
The
leech
*NL*
gazed
intently
from
me
to
Toby
,
and
then
proceeded
to
business
.
After
*NL*
diligently
observing
the
ailing
member
,
he
commenced
manipulating
it
;
*NL*
and
on
the
supposition
probably
that
the
complaint
had
deprived
the
leg
*NL*
of
all
sensation
,
began
to
pinch
and
hammer
it
in
such
a
manner
that
I
*NL*
absolutely
roared
with
pain
.
Thinking
that
I
was
as
capable
of
making
*NL*
an
application
of
thumps
and
pinches
to
the
part
as
any
one
else
,
I
*NL*
endeavoured
to
resist
this
species
of
medical
treatment
.
But
it
was
*NL*
not
so
easy
a
matter
to
get
out
of
the
clutches
of
the
old
wizard
;
he
*NL*
fastened
on
the
unfortunate
limb
as
if
it
were
something
for
which
he
*NL*
had
been
long
seeking
,
and
muttering
some
kind
of
incantation
continued
*NL*
his
discipline
,
pounding
it
after
a
fashion
that
set
me
well
nigh
crazy
;
*NL*
while
Mehevi
,
upon
the
same
principle
which
prompts
an
affectionate
*NL*
mother
to
hold
a
struggling
child
in
a
dentist
's
chair
,
restrained
me
*NL*
in
his
powerful
grasp
,
and
actually
encouraged
the
wretch
in
this
*NL*
infliction
of
torture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
frantic
with
rage
and
pain
,
I
yelled
like
a
bedlamite
;
while
*NL*
Toby
,
throwing
himself
into
all
the
attitudes
of
a
posture-master
,
*NL*
vainly
endeavoured
to
expostulate
with
the
natives
by
signs
and
*NL*
gestures
.
To
have
looked
at
my
companion
,
as
,
sympathizing
with
my
*NL*
sufferings
,
he
strove
to
put
an
end
to
them
,
one
would
have
thought
*NL*
that
he
was
the
deaf
and
dumb
alphabet
incarnated
.
Whether
my
tormentor
*NL*
yielded
to
Toby
's
entreaties
,
or
paused
from
sheer
exhaustion
,
I
do
not
*NL*
know
;
but
all
at
once
he
ceased
his
operations
,
and
at
the
same
time
the
*NL*
chief
relinquishing
his
hold
upon
me
,
I
fell
back
,
faint
and
breathless
*NL*
with
the
agony
I
had
endured
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
unfortunate
limb
was
now
left
much
in
the
same
condition
as
a
*NL*
rump-steak
after
undergoing
the
castigating
process
which
precedes
*NL*
cooking
.
My
physician
,
having
recovered
from
the
fatigues
of
his
*NL*
exertions
,
as
if
anxious
to
make
amends
for
the
pain
to
which
he
had
*NL*
subjected
me
,
now
took
some
herbs
out
of
a
little
wallet
that
was
*NL*
suspended
from
his
waist
,
and
moistening
them
in
water
,
applied
them
*NL*
to
the
inflamed
part
,
stooping
over
it
at
the
same
time
,
and
either
*NL*
whispering
a
spell
,
or
having
a
little
confidential
chat
with
some
*NL*
imaginary
demon
located
in
the
calf
of
my
leg
.
My
limb
was
now
swathed
*NL*
in
leafy
bandages
,
and
grateful
to
Providence
for
the
cessation
of
*NL*
hostilities
,
I
was
suffered
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mehevi
shortly
after
rose
to
depart
;
but
before
he
went
he
spoke
*NL*
authoritatively
to
one
of
the
natives
whom
he
addressed
as
Kory-Kory
;
*NL*
and
from
the
little
I
could
understand
of
what
took
place
,
pointed
*NL*
him
out
to
me
as
a
man
whose
peculiar
business
thenceforth
would
be
to
*NL*
attend
upon
my
person
.
I
am
not
certain
that
I
comprehended
as
much
as
*NL*
this
at
the
time
,
but
the
subsequent
conduct
of
my
trusty
body-servant
*NL*
fully
assured
me
that
such
must
have
been
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
but
be
amused
at
the
manner
in
which
the
chief
addressed
me
*NL*
upon
this
occasion
,
talking
to
me
for
at
least
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
*NL*
as
calmly
as
if
I
could
understand
every
word
that
he
said
.
I
remarked
*NL*
this
peculiarity
very
often
afterwards
in
many
other
of
the
islanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mehevi
having
now
departed
,
and
the
family
physician
having
likewise
*NL*
made
his
exit
,
we
were
left
about
sunset
with
ten
or
twelve
natives
,
who
*NL*
by
this
time
I
had
ascertained
composed
the
household
of
which
Toby
and
*NL*
I
were
members
.
As
the
dwelling
to
which
we
had
been
first
introduced
*NL*
was
the
place
of
my
permanent
abode
while
I
remained
in
the
valley
,
*NL*
and
as
I
was
necessarily
placed
upon
the
most
intimate
footing
with
its
*NL*
occupants
,
I
may
as
well
here
enter
into
a
little
description
of
it
*NL*
and
its
inhabitants
.
This
description
will
apply
also
to
nearly
all
the
*NL*
other
dwelling-places
in
the
vale
,
and
will
furnish
some
idea
of
the
*NL*
generality
of
the
natives
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
one
side
of
the
valley
,
and
about
midway
up
the
ascent
of
a
rather
*NL*
abrupt
rise
of
ground
waving
with
the
richest
verdure
,
a
number
of
large
*NL*
stones
were
laid
in
successive
courses
,
to
the
height
of
nearly
*NL*
eight
feet
,
and
disposed
in
such
a
manner
that
their
level
surface
*NL*
corresponded
in
shape
with
the
habitation
which
was
perched
upon
it
.
A
*NL*
narrow
space
,
however
,
was
reserved
in
front
of
the
dwelling
,
upon
the
*NL*
summit
of
this
pile
of
stones
-LRB-
called
by
the
natives
a
`
pi-pi
'
-RRB-
,
*NL*
which
being
enclosed
by
a
little
picket
of
canes
,
gave
it
somewhat
the
*NL*
appearance
of
a
verandah
.
The
frame
of
the
house
was
constructed
of
*NL*
large
bamboos
planted
uprightly
,
and
secured
together
at
intervals
by
*NL*
transverse
stalks
of
the
light
wood
of
the
habiscus
,
lashed
with
thongs
*NL*
of
bark
.
The
rear
of
the
tenement
--
built
up
with
successive
ranges
of
*NL*
cocoanut
boughs
bound
one
upon
another
,
with
their
leaflets
cunningly
*NL*
woven
together
--
inclined
a
little
from
the
vertical
,
and
extended
from
*NL*
the
extreme
edge
of
the
`
pi-pi
'
to
about
twenty
feet
from
its
surface
;
*NL*
whence
the
shelving
roof
--
thatched
with
the
long
tapering
leaves
of
the
*NL*
palmetto
--
sloped
steeply
off
to
within
about
five
feet
of
the
floor
;
*NL*
leaving
the
eaves
drooping
with
tassel-like
appendages
over
the
front
*NL*
of
the
habitation
.
This
was
constructed
of
light
and
elegant
canes
in
a
*NL*
kind
of
open
screenwork
,
tastefully
adorned
with
bindings
of
variegated
*NL*
sinnate
,
which
served
to
hold
together
its
various
parts
.
The
sides
of
*NL*
the
house
were
similarly
built
;
thus
presenting
three
quarters
for
the
*NL*
circulation
of
the
air
,
while
the
whole
was
impervious
to
the
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
length
this
picturesque
building
was
perhaps
twelve
yards
,
while
*NL*
in
breadth
it
could
not
have
exceeded
as
many
feet
.
So
much
for
the
*NL*
exterior
;
which
,
with
its
wire-like
reed-twisted
sides
,
not
a
little
*NL*
reminded
me
of
an
immense
aviary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stooping
a
little
,
you
passed
through
a
narrow
aperture
in
its
front
;
*NL*
and
facing
you
,
on
entering
,
lay
two
long
,
perfectly
straight
,
and
*NL*
well-polished
trunks
of
the
cocoanut
tree
,
extending
the
full
length
of
*NL*
the
dwelling
;
one
of
them
placed
closely
against
the
rear
,
and
the
other
*NL*
lying
parallel
with
it
some
two
yards
distant
,
the
interval
between
*NL*
them
being
spread
with
a
multitude
of
gaily-worked
mats
,
nearly
all
of
a
*NL*
different
pattern
.
This
space
formed
the
common
couch
and
lounging
place
*NL*
of
the
natives
,
answering
the
purpose
of
a
divan
in
Oriental
countries
.
*NL*
Here
would
they
slumber
through
the
hours
of
the
night
,
and
recline
*NL*
luxuriously
during
the
greater
part
of
the
day
.
The
remainder
of
the
*NL*
floor
presented
only
the
cool
shining
surfaces
of
the
large
stones
of
*NL*
which
the
`
pi-pi
'
was
composed
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
ridge-pole
of
the
house
hung
suspended
a
number
of
large
*NL*
packages
enveloped
in
coarse
tappa
;
some
of
which
contained
festival
*NL*
dresses
,
and
various
other
matters
of
the
wardrobe
,
held
in
high
*NL*
estimation
.
These
were
easily
accessible
by
means
of
a
line
,
which
,
*NL*
passing
over
the
ridge-pole
,
had
one
end
attached
to
a
bundle
,
while
*NL*
with
the
other
,
which
led
to
the
side
of
the
dwelling
and
was
there
*NL*
secured
,
the
package
could
be
lowered
or
elevated
at
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Against
the
farther
wall
of
the
house
were
arranged
in
tasteful
figures
*NL*
a
variety
of
spears
and
javelins
,
and
other
implements
of
savage
*NL*
warfare
.
Outside
of
the
habitation
,
and
built
upon
the
piazza-like
area
*NL*
in
its
front
,
was
a
little
shed
used
as
a
sort
of
larder
or
pantry
,
and
*NL*
in
which
were
stored
various
articles
of
domestic
use
and
convenience
.
*NL*
A
few
yards
from
the
pi-pi
was
a
large
shed
built
of
cocoanut
boughs
,
*NL*
where
the
process
of
preparing
the
`
poee-poee
'
was
carried
on
,
and
all
*NL*
culinary
operations
attended
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
much
for
the
house
,
and
its
appurtenances
;
and
it
will
be
readily
*NL*
acknowledged
that
a
more
commodious
and
appropriate
dwelling
for
the
*NL*
climate
and
the
people
could
not
possibly
be
devised
.
It
was
cool
,
free
*NL*
to
admit
the
air
,
scrupulously
clean
,
and
elevated
above
the
dampness
*NL*
and
impurities
of
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
now
to
sketch
the
inmates
;
and
here
I
claim
for
my
tried
servitor
*NL*
and
faithful
valet
Kory-Kory
the
precedence
of
a
first
description
.
As
*NL*
his
character
will
be
gradually
unfolded
in
the
course
of
my
narrative
,
*NL*
I
shall
for
the
present
content
myself
with
delineating
his
personal
*NL*
appearance
.
Kory-Kory
,
though
the
most
devoted
and
best
natured
*NL*
serving-man
in
the
world
,
was
,
alas
!
a
hideous
object
to
look
upon
.
He
*NL*
was
some
twenty-five
years
of
age
,
and
about
six
feet
in
height
,
robust
*NL*
and
well
made
,
and
of
the
most
extraordinary
aspect
.
His
head
was
*NL*
carefully
shaven
with
the
exception
of
two
circular
spots
,
about
the
*NL*
size
of
a
dollar
,
near
the
top
of
the
cranium
,
where
the
hair
,
permitted
*NL*
to
grow
of
an
amazing
length
,
was
twisted
up
in
two
prominent
knots
,
*NL*
that
gave
him
the
appearance
of
being
decorated
with
a
pair
of
horns
.
*NL*
His
beard
,
plucked
out
by
the
root
from
every
other
part
of
his
face
,
*NL*
was
suffered
to
droop
in
hairy
pendants
,
two
of
which
garnished
his
*NL*
under
lip
,
and
an
equal
number
hung
from
the
extremity
of
his
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kory-Kory
,
with
a
view
of
improving
the
handiwork
of
nature
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
prompted
by
a
desire
to
add
to
the
engaging
expression
of
*NL*
his
countenance
,
had
seen
fit
to
embellish
his
face
with
three
broad
*NL*
longitudinal
stripes
of
tattooing
,
which
,
like
those
country
roads
that
*NL*
go
straight
forward
in
defiance
of
all
obstacles
,
crossed
his
nasal
*NL*
organ
,
descended
into
the
hollow
of
his
eyes
,
and
even
skirted
the
*NL*
borders
of
his
mouth
.
Each
completely
spanned
his
physiognomy
;
one
*NL*
extending
in
a
line
with
his
eyes
,
another
crossing
the
face
in
the
*NL*
vicinity
of
the
nose
,
and
the
third
sweeping
along
his
lips
from
ear
*NL*
to
ear
.
His
countenance
thus
triply
hooped
,
as
it
were
,
with
tattooing
,
*NL*
always
reminded
me
of
those
unhappy
wretches
whom
I
have
sometimes
*NL*
observed
gazing
out
sentimentally
from
behind
the
grated
bars
of
a
*NL*
prison
window
;
whilst
the
entire
body
of
my
savage
valet
,
covered
all
*NL*
over
with
representations
of
birds
and
fishes
,
and
a
variety
of
most
*NL*
unaccountable-looking
creatures
,
suggested
to
me
the
idea
of
a
pictorial
*NL*
museum
of
natural
history
,
or
an
illustrated
copy
of
`
Goldsmith
's
*NL*
Animated
Nature
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
seems
really
heartless
in
me
to
write
thus
of
the
poor
islander
,
*NL*
when
I
owe
perhaps
to
his
unremitting
attentions
the
very
existence
I
*NL*
now
enjoy
.
Kory-Kory
,
I
mean
thee
no
harm
in
what
I
say
in
regard
to
*NL*
thy
outward
adornings
;
but
they
were
a
little
curious
to
my
unaccustomed
*NL*
sight
,
and
therefore
I
dilate
upon
them
.
But
to
underrate
or
forget
thy
*NL*
faithful
services
is
something
I
could
never
be
guilty
of
,
even
in
the
*NL*
giddiest
moment
of
my
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
of
my
attached
follower
was
a
native
of
gigantic
frame
,
and
*NL*
had
once
possessed
prodigious
physical
powers
;
but
the
lofty
form
was
*NL*
now
yielding
to
the
inroads
of
time
,
though
the
hand
of
disease
seemed
*NL*
never
to
have
been
laid
upon
the
aged
warrior
.
Marheyo
--
for
such
was
*NL*
his
name
--
appeared
to
have
retired
from
all
active
participation
in
the
*NL*
affairs
of
the
valley
,
seldom
or
never
accompanying
the
natives
in
*NL*
their
various
expeditions
;
and
employing
the
greater
part
of
his
time
*NL*
in
throwing
up
a
little
shed
just
outside
the
house
,
upon
which
he
was
*NL*
engaged
to
my
certain
knowledge
for
four
months
,
without
appearing
*NL*
to
make
any
sensible
advance
.
I
suppose
the
old
gentleman
was
in
his
*NL*
dotage
,
for
he
manifested
in
various
ways
the
characteristics
which
mark
*NL*
this
particular
stage
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
in
particular
his
having
a
choice
pair
of
ear-ornaments
,
*NL*
fabricated
from
the
teeth
of
some
sea-monster
.
These
he
would
*NL*
alternately
wear
and
take
off
at
least
fifty
times
in
the
course
of
the
*NL*
day
,
going
and
coming
from
his
little
hut
on
each
occasion
with
all
the
*NL*
tranquillity
imaginable
.
Sometimes
slipping
them
through
the
slits
*NL*
in
his
ears
,
he
would
seize
his
spear
--
which
in
length
and
slightness
*NL*
resembled
a
fishing-pole
--
and
go
stalking
beneath
the
shadows
of
the
*NL*
neighbouring
groves
,
as
if
about
to
give
a
hostile
meeting
to
some
*NL*
cannibal
knight
.
But
he
would
soon
return
again
,
and
hiding
his
weapon
*NL*
under
the
projecting
eaves
of
the
house
,
and
rolling
his
clumsy
trinkets
*NL*
carefully
in
a
piece
of
tappa
,
would
resume
his
more
pacific
operations
*NL*
as
quietly
as
if
he
had
never
interrupted
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
despite
his
eccentricities
,
Marheyo
was
a
most
paternal
and
*NL*
warm-hearted
old
fellow
,
and
in
this
particular
not
a
little
resembled
*NL*
his
son
Kory-Kory
.
The
mother
of
the
latter
was
the
mistress
of
the
*NL*
family
,
and
a
notable
housewife
,
and
a
most
industrious
old
lady
she
*NL*
was
.
If
she
did
not
understand
the
art
of
making
jellies
,
jams
,
custard
,
*NL*
tea-cakes
,
and
such
like
trashy
affairs
,
she
was
profoundly
skilled
in
*NL*
the
mysteries
of
preparing
`
amar
'
,
`
poee-poee
'
,
and
`
kokoo
'
,
with
other
*NL*
substantial
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
genuine
busy-body
;
bustling
about
the
house
like
a
country
*NL*
landlady
at
an
unexpected
arrival
;
for
ever
giving
the
young
girls
tasks
*NL*
to
perform
,
which
the
little
hussies
as
often
neglected
;
poking
into
*NL*
every
corner
,
and
rummaging
over
bundles
of
old
tappa
,
or
making
a
*NL*
prodigious
clatter
among
the
calabashes
.
Sometimes
she
might
have
been
*NL*
seen
squatting
upon
her
haunches
in
front
of
a
huge
wooden
basin
,
and
*NL*
kneading
poee-poee
with
terrific
vehemence
,
dashing
the
stone
pestle
*NL*
about
as
if
she
would
shiver
the
vessel
into
fragments
;
on
other
*NL*
occasions
,
galloping
about
the
valley
in
search
of
a
particular
kind
*NL*
of
leaf
,
used
in
some
of
her
recondite
operations
,
and
returning
home
,
*NL*
toiling
and
sweating
,
with
a
bundle
of
it
,
under
which
most
women
would
*NL*
have
sunk
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
tell
the
truth
,
Kory-Kory
's
mother
was
the
only
industrious
person
*NL*
in
all
the
valley
of
Typee
;
and
she
could
not
have
employed
herself
more
*NL*
actively
had
she
been
left
an
exceedingly
muscular
and
destitute
widow
,
*NL*
with
an
inordinate
ate
supply
of
young
children
,
in
the
bleakest
part
*NL*
of
the
civilized
world
.
There
was
not
the
slightest
necessity
for
the
*NL*
greater
portion
of
the
labour
performed
by
the
old
lady
:
but
she
seemed
*NL*
to
work
from
some
irresistible
impulse
;
her
limbs
continually
swaying
to
*NL*
and
fro
,
as
if
there
were
some
indefatigable
engine
concealed
within
her
*NL*
body
which
kept
her
in
perpetual
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
suppose
that
she
was
a
termagant
or
a
shrew
for
all
this
;
she
had
*NL*
the
kindliest
heart
in
the
world
,
and
acted
towards
me
in
particular
*NL*
in
a
truly
maternal
manner
,
occasionally
putting
some
little
morsel
of
*NL*
choice
food
into
my
hand
,
some
outlandish
kind
of
savage
sweetmeat
or
*NL*
pastry
,
like
a
doting
mother
petting
a
sickly
urchin
with
tarts
*NL*
and
sugar
plums
.
Warm
indeed
are
my
remembrances
of
the
dear
,
good
,
*NL*
affectionate
old
Tinor
!
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
individuals
I
have
mentioned
,
there
belonged
to
the
*NL*
household
three
young
men
,
dissipated
,
good-for-nothing
,
roystering
*NL*
blades
of
savages
,
who
were
either
employed
in
prosecuting
love
affairs
*NL*
with
the
maidens
of
the
tribe
,
or
grew
boozy
on
`
arva
'
and
tobacco
in
*NL*
the
company
of
congenial
spirits
,
the
scapegraces
of
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
permanent
inmates
of
the
house
were
likewise
several
lovely
*NL*
damsels
,
who
instead
of
thrumming
pianos
and
reading
novels
,
like
*NL*
more
enlightened
young
ladies
,
substituted
for
these
employments
the
*NL*
manufacture
of
a
fine
species
of
tappa
;
but
for
the
greater
portion
of
*NL*
the
time
were
skipping
from
house
to
house
,
gadding
and
gossiping
with
*NL*
their
acquaintances
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
rest
of
these
,
however
,
I
must
except
the
beauteous
nymph
*NL*
Fayaway
,
who
was
my
peculiar
favourite
.
Her
free
pliant
figure
was
the
*NL*
very
perfection
of
female
grace
and
beauty
.
Her
complexion
was
a
rich
*NL*
and
mantling
olive
,
and
when
watching
the
glow
upon
her
cheeks
I
could
*NL*
almost
swear
that
beneath
the
transparent
medium
there
lurked
the
*NL*
blushes
of
a
faint
vermilion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
of
this
girl
was
a
rounded
oval
,
and
each
feature
as
perfectly
*NL*
formed
as
the
heart
or
imagination
of
man
could
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
full
lips
,
when
parted
with
a
smile
,
disclosed
teeth
of
dazzling
*NL*
whiteness
and
when
her
rosy
mouth
opened
with
a
burst
of
merriment
,
they
*NL*
looked
like
the
milk-white
seeds
of
the
`
arta
,
'
a
fruit
of
the
valley
,
*NL*
which
,
when
cleft
in
twain
,
shows
them
reposing
in
rows
on
each
side
,
*NL*
imbedded
in
the
red
and
juicy
pulp
.
Her
hair
of
the
deepest
brown
,
*NL*
parted
irregularly
in
the
middle
,
flowed
in
natural
ringlets
over
her
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
whenever
she
chanced
to
stoop
,
fell
over
and
hid
from
*NL*
view
her
lovely
bosom
.
Gazing
into
the
depths
of
her
strange
blue
*NL*
eyes
,
when
she
was
in
a
contemplative
mood
,
they
seemed
most
placid
yet
*NL*
unfathomable
;
but
when
illuminated
by
some
lively
emotion
,
they
beamed
*NL*
upon
the
beholder
like
stars
.
The
hands
of
Fayaway
were
as
soft
and
*NL*
delicate
as
those
of
any
countess
;
for
an
entire
exemption
from
rude
*NL*
labour
marks
the
girlhood
and
even
prime
of
a
Typee
woman
's
life
.
Her
*NL*
feet
,
though
wholly
exposed
,
were
as
diminutive
and
fairly
shaped
as
*NL*
those
which
peep
from
beneath
the
skirts
of
a
Lima
lady
's
dress
.
The
*NL*
skin
of
this
young
creature
,
from
continual
ablutions
and
the
use
of
*NL*
mollifying
ointments
,
was
inconceivably
smooth
and
soft
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
may
succeed
,
perhaps
,
in
particularizing
some
of
the
individual
*NL*
features
of
Fayaway
's
beauty
,
but
that
general
loveliness
of
appearance
*NL*
which
they
all
contributed
to
produce
I
will
not
attempt
to
describe
.
*NL*
The
easy
unstudied
graces
of
a
child
of
nature
like
this
,
breathing
from
*NL*
infancy
an
atmosphere
of
perpetual
summer
,
and
nurtured
by
the
simple
*NL*
fruits
of
the
earth
;
enjoying
a
perfect
freedom
from
care
and
anxiety
,
*NL*
and
removed
effectually
from
all
injurious
tendencies
,
strike
the
eye
in
*NL*
a
manner
which
can
not
be
pourtrayed
.
This
picture
is
no
fancy
sketch
;
it
*NL*
is
drawn
from
the
most
vivid
recollections
of
the
person
delineated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Were
I
asked
if
the
beauteous
form
of
Fayaway
was
altogether
free
from
*NL*
the
hideous
blemish
of
tattooing
,
I
should
be
constrained
to
answer
that
*NL*
it
was
not
.
But
the
practitioners
of
the
barbarous
art
,
so
remorseless
*NL*
in
their
inflictions
upon
the
brawny
limbs
of
the
warriors
of
the
tribe
,
*NL*
seem
to
be
conscious
that
it
needs
not
the
resources
of
their
profession
*NL*
to
augment
the
charms
of
the
maidens
of
the
vale
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
females
are
very
little
embellished
in
this
way
,
and
Fayaway
,
and
*NL*
all
the
other
young
girls
of
her
age
,
were
even
less
so
than
those
of
*NL*
their
sex
more
advanced
in
years
.
The
reason
of
this
peculiarity
will
*NL*
be
alluded
to
hereafter
.
All
the
tattooing
that
the
nymph
in
question
*NL*
exhibited
upon
her
person
may
be
easily
described
.
Three
minute
dots
,
no
*NL*
bigger
than
pin-heads
,
decorated
each
lip
,
and
at
a
little
distance
were
*NL*
not
at
all
discernible
.
Just
upon
the
fall
of
the
shoulder
were
drawn
*NL*
two
parallel
lines
half
an
inch
apart
,
and
perhaps
three
inches
in
*NL*
length
,
the
interval
being
filled
with
delicately
executed
figures
.
*NL*
These
narrow
bands
of
tattooing
,
thus
placed
,
always
reminded
me
of
*NL*
those
stripes
of
gold
lace
worn
by
officers
in
undress
,
and
which
are
in
*NL*
lieu
of
epaulettes
to
denote
their
rank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
much
was
Fayaway
tattooed
.
The
audacious
hand
which
had
gone
so
far
*NL*
in
its
desecrating
work
stopping
short
,
apparently
wanting
the
heart
to
*NL*
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
I
have
omitted
to
describe
the
dress
worn
by
this
nymph
of
the
*NL*
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fayaway
--
I
must
avow
the
fact
--
for
the
most
part
clung
to
the
primitive
*NL*
and
summer
garb
of
Eden
.
But
how
becoming
the
costume
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
showed
her
fine
figure
to
the
best
possible
advantage
;
and
nothing
*NL*
could
have
been
better
adapted
to
her
peculiar
style
of
beauty
.
On
*NL*
ordinary
occasions
she
was
habited
precisely
as
I
have
described
the
two
*NL*
youthful
savages
whom
we
had
met
on
first
entering
the
valley
.
At
other
*NL*
times
,
when
rambling
among
the
groves
,
or
visiting
at
the
houses
of
her
*NL*
acquaintances
,
she
wore
a
tunic
of
white
tappa
,
reaching
from
her
waist
*NL*
to
a
little
below
the
knees
;
and
when
exposed
for
any
length
of
time
to
*NL*
the
sun
,
she
invariably
protected
herself
from
its
rays
by
a
floating
*NL*
mantle
of
--
the
same
material
,
loosely
gathered
about
the
person
.
Her
*NL*
gala
dress
will
be
described
hereafter
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
beauties
of
our
own
land
delight
in
bedecking
themselves
with
*NL*
fanciful
articles
of
jewellery
,
suspending
them
from
their
ears
,
hanging
*NL*
them
about
their
necks
,
and
clasping
them
around
their
wrists
;
so
*NL*
Fayaway
and
her
companions
were
in
the
habit
of
ornamenting
themselves
*NL*
with
similar
appendages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Flora
was
their
jeweller
.
Sometimes
they
wore
necklaces
of
small
*NL*
carnation
flowers
,
strung
like
rubies
upon
a
fibre
of
tappa
,
or
*NL*
displayed
in
their
ears
a
single
white
bud
,
the
stem
thrust
backward
*NL*
through
the
aperture
,
and
showing
in
front
the
delicate
petals
folded
*NL*
together
in
a
beautiful
sphere
,
and
looking
like
a
drop
of
the
purest
*NL*
pearl
.
Chaplets
too
,
resembling
in
their
arrangement
the
strawberry
*NL*
coronal
worn
by
an
English
peeress
,
and
composed
of
intertwined
leaves
*NL*
and
blossoms
,
often
crowned
their
temples
;
and
bracelets
and
anklets
*NL*
of
the
same
tasteful
pattern
were
frequently
to
be
seen
.
Indeed
,
the
*NL*
maidens
of
the
island
were
passionately
fond
of
flowers
,
and
never
*NL*
wearied
of
decorating
their
persons
with
them
;
a
lovely
trait
in
their
*NL*
character
,
and
one
that
ere
long
will
be
more
fully
alluded
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
in
my
eyes
,
at
least
,
Fayaway
was
indisputably
the
loveliest
*NL*
female
I
saw
in
Typee
,
yet
the
description
I
have
given
of
her
will
in
*NL*
some
measure
apply
to
nearly
all
the
youthful
portion
of
her
sex
in
the
*NL*
valley
.
Judge
ye
then
,
reader
,
what
beautiful
creatures
they
must
have
*NL*
been
.

STRANGE
PROCESSION
AND
*NL*
RETURN
TO
THE
HOUSE
OF
MARHEYO
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
Mehevi
had
departed
from
the
house
,
as
related
in
the
preceding
*NL*
chapter
,
Kory-Kory
commenced
the
functions
of
the
post
assigned
him
.
*NL*
He
brought
out
,
various
kinds
of
food
;
and
,
as
if
I
were
an
infant
,
*NL*
insisted
upon
feeding
me
with
his
own
hands
.
To
this
procedure
I
,
of
*NL*
course
,
most
earnestly
objected
,
but
in
vain
;
and
having
laid
a
calabash
*NL*
of
kokoo
before
me
,
he
washed
his
fingers
in
a
vessel
of
water
,
and
then
*NL*
putting
his
hands
into
the
dish
and
rolling
the
food
into
little
balls
,
*NL*
put
them
one
after
another
into
my
mouth
.
All
my
remonstrances
against
*NL*
this
measure
only
provoked
so
great
a
clamour
on
his
part
,
that
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
acquiesce
;
and
the
operation
of
feeding
being
thus
*NL*
facilitated
,
the
meal
was
quickly
despatched
.
As
for
Toby
,
he
was
*NL*
allowed
to
help
himself
after
his
own
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
repast
over
,
my
attendant
arranged
the
mats
for
repose
,
and
,
bidding
*NL*
me
lie
down
,
covered
me
with
a
large
robe
of
tappa
,
at
the
same
time
*NL*
looking
approvingly
upon
me
,
and
exclaiming
`
Ki-Ki
,
nuee
nuee
,
ah
!
moee
*NL*
moee
motarkee
'
-LRB-
eat
plenty
,
ah
!
sleep
very
good
-RRB-
.
The
philosophy
of
*NL*
this
sentiment
I
did
not
pretend
to
question
;
for
deprived
of
sleep
for
*NL*
several
preceding
nights
,
and
the
pain
of
my
limb
having
much
abated
,
I
*NL*
now
felt
inclined
to
avail
myself
of
the
opportunity
afforded
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
on
waking
,
I
found
Kory-Kory
stretched
out
on
one
side
*NL*
of
me
,
while
my
companion
lay
upon
the
other
.
I
felt
sensibly
refreshed
*NL*
after
a
night
of
sound
repose
,
and
immediately
agreed
to
the
proposition
*NL*
of
my
valet
that
I
should
repair
to
the
water
and
wash
,
although
*NL*
dreading
the
suffering
that
the
exertion
might
produce
.
From
this
*NL*
apprehension
,
however
,
I
was
quickly
relieved
;
for
Kory-Kory
,
leaping
*NL*
from
the
pi-pi
,
and
then
backing
himself
up
against
it
,
like
a
porter
*NL*
in
readiness
to
shoulder
a
trunk
,
with
loud
vociferations
and
a
*NL*
superabundance
of
gestures
,
gave
me
to
understand
that
I
was
to
mount
*NL*
upon
his
back
and
be
thus
transported
to
the
stream
,
which
flowed
*NL*
perhaps
two
hundred
yards
from
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
appearance
upon
the
verandah
in
front
of
the
habitation
drew
*NL*
together
quite
a
crowd
,
who
stood
looking
on
and
conversing
with
one
*NL*
another
in
the
most
animated
manner
.
They
reminded
one
of
a
group
of
*NL*
idlers
gathered
about
the
door
of
a
village
tavern
when
the
equipage
*NL*
of
some
distinguished
traveller
is
brought
round
previously
to
his
*NL*
departure
.
As
soon
as
I
clasped
my
arms
about
the
neck
of
the
devoted
*NL*
fellow
,
and
he
jogged
off
with
me
,
the
crowd
--
composed
chiefly
of
young
*NL*
girls
and
boys
--
followed
after
,
shouting
and
capering
with
infinite
*NL*
glee
,
and
accompanied
us
to
the
banks
of
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
gaining
it
,
Kory-Kory
,
wading
up
to
his
hips
in
the
water
,
carried
me
*NL*
half
way
across
,
and
deposited
me
on
a
smooth
black
stone
which
rose
a
*NL*
few
inches
above
the
surface
.
The
amphibious
rabble
at
our
heels
plunged
*NL*
in
after
us
,
and
climbing
to
the
summit
of
the
grass-grown
rocks
with
*NL*
which
the
bed
of
the
brook
was
here
and
there
broken
,
waited
curiously
*NL*
to
witness
our
morning
ablutions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somewhat
embarrassed
by
the
presence
of
the
female
portion
of
the
*NL*
company
,
and
feeling
my
cheeks
burning
with
bashful
timidity
,
I
formed
*NL*
a
primitive
basin
by
joining
my
hands
together
,
and
cooled
my
blushes
*NL*
in
the
water
it
contained
;
then
removing
my
frock
,
bent
over
and
washed
*NL*
myself
down
to
my
waist
in
the
stream
.
As
soon
as
Kory-Kory
comprehended
*NL*
from
my
motions
that
this
was
to
be
the
extent
of
my
performance
,
he
*NL*
appeared
perfectly
aghast
with
astonishment
,
and
rushing
towards
me
,
*NL*
poured
out
a
torrent
of
words
in
eager
deprecation
of
so
limited
an
*NL*
operation
,
enjoining
me
by
unmistakable
signs
to
immerse
my
whole
body
.
*NL*
To
this
I
was
forced
to
consent
;
and
the
honest
fellow
regarding
me
as
a
*NL*
froward
,
inexperienced
child
,
whom
it
was
his
duty
to
serve
at
the
risk
*NL*
of
offending
,
lifted
me
from
the
rocks
,
and
tenderly
bathed
my
limbs
.
*NL*
This
over
,
and
resuming
my
seat
,
I
could
not
avoid
bursting
into
*NL*
admiration
of
the
scene
around
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
verdant
surfaces
of
the
large
stones
that
lay
scattered
about
,
*NL*
the
natives
were
now
sliding
off
into
the
water
,
diving
and
ducking
*NL*
beneath
the
surface
in
all
directions
--
the
young
girls
springing
*NL*
buoyantly
into
the
air
,
and
revealing
their
naked
forms
to
the
waist
,
*NL*
with
their
long
tresses
dancing
about
their
shoulders
,
their
eyes
*NL*
sparkling
like
drops
of
dew
in
the
sun
,
and
their
gay
laughter
pealing
*NL*
forth
at
every
frolicsome
incident
.
On
the
afternoon
of
the
day
that
I
*NL*
took
my
first
bath
in
the
valley
,
we
received
another
visit
from
Mehevi
.
*NL*
The
noble
savage
seemed
to
be
in
the
same
pleasant
mood
,
and
was
quite
*NL*
as
cordial
in
his
manner
as
before
.
After
remaining
about
an
hour
,
he
*NL*
rose
from
the
mats
,
and
motioning
to
leave
the
house
,
invited
Toby
and
*NL*
myself
to
accompany
him
.
I
pointed
to
my
leg
;
but
Mehevi
in
his
turn
*NL*
pointed
to
Kory-Kory
,
and
removed
that
objection
;
so
,
mounting
upon
the
*NL*
faithful
fellow
's
shoulders
again
--
like
the
old
man
of
the
sea
astride
*NL*
of
Sindbad
--
I
followed
after
the
chief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nature
of
the
route
we
now
pursued
struck
me
more
forcibly
than
*NL*
anything
I
had
yet
seen
,
as
illustrating
the
indolent
disposition
of
*NL*
the
islanders
.
The
path
was
obviously
the
most
beaten
one
in
the
*NL*
valley
,
several
others
leading
from
each
side
into
it
,
and
perhaps
for
*NL*
successive
generations
it
had
formed
the
principal
avenue
of
the
place
.
*NL*
And
yet
,
until
I
grew
more
familiar
with
its
impediments
,
it
seemed
as
*NL*
difficult
to
travel
as
the
recesses
of
a
wilderness
.
Part
of
it
swept
*NL*
around
an
abrupt
rise
of
ground
,
the
surface
of
which
was
broken
by
*NL*
frequent
inequalities
,
and
thickly
strewn
with
projecting
masses
of
*NL*
rocks
,
whose
summits
were
often
hidden
from
view
by
the
drooping
foliage
*NL*
of
the
luxurious
vegetation
.
Sometimes
directly
over
,
sometimes
evading
*NL*
these
obstacles
with
a
wide
circuit
,
the
path
wound
along
;
--
one
moment
*NL*
climbing
over
a
sudden
eminence
smooth
with
continued
wear
,
then
*NL*
descending
on
the
other
side
into
a
steep
glen
,
and
crossing
the
flinty
*NL*
channel
of
a
brook
.
Here
it
pursued
the
depths
of
a
glade
,
occasionally
*NL*
obliging
you
to
stoop
beneath
vast
horizontal
branches
;
and
now
you
*NL*
stepped
over
huge
trunks
and
boughs
that
lay
rotting
across
the
track
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
grand
thoroughfare
of
Typee
.
After
proceeding
a
little
*NL*
distance
along
it
--
Kory-Kory
panting
and
blowing
with
the
weight
of
*NL*
his
burden
--
I
dismounted
from
his
back
,
and
grasping
the
long
spear
of
*NL*
Mehevi
in
my
hand
,
assisted
my
steps
over
the
numerous
obstacles
of
*NL*
the
road
;
preferring
this
mode
of
advance
to
one
which
,
from
the
*NL*
difficulties
of
the
way
,
was
equally
painful
to
myself
and
my
wearied
*NL*
servitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
journey
was
soon
at
an
end
;
for
,
scaling
a
sudden
height
,
we
came
*NL*
abruptly
upon
the
place
of
our
destination
.
I
wish
that
it
were
possible
*NL*
to
sketch
in
words
this
spot
as
vividly
as
I
recollect
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
were
situated
the
Taboo
groves
of
the
valley
--
the
scene
of
many
a
*NL*
prolonged
feast
,
of
many
a
horrid
rite
.
Beneath
the
dark
shadows
of
*NL*
the
consecrated
bread-fruit
trees
there
reigned
a
solemn
twilight
--
a
*NL*
cathedral-like
gloom
.
The
frightful
genius
of
pagan
worship
seemed
to
*NL*
brood
in
silence
over
the
place
,
breathing
its
spell
upon
every
object
*NL*
around
.
Here
and
there
,
in
the
depths
of
these
awful
shades
,
half
*NL*
screened
from
sight
by
masses
of
overhanging
foliage
,
rose
the
*NL*
idolatrous
altars
of
the
savages
,
built
of
enormous
blocks
of
black
and
*NL*
polished
stone
,
placed
one
upon
another
,
without
cement
,
to
the
height
*NL*
of
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
,
and
surmounted
by
a
rustic
open
temple
,
*NL*
enclosed
with
a
low
picket
of
canes
,
within
which
might
be
seen
,
in
*NL*
various
stages
of
decay
,
offerings
of
bread-fruit
and
cocoanuts
,
and
the
*NL*
putrefying
relics
of
some
recent
sacrifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
wood
was
the
hallowed
`
Hoolah
Hoolah
'
ground
--
set
*NL*
apart
for
the
celebration
of
the
fantastical
religious
ritual
of
these
*NL*
people
--
comprising
an
extensive
oblong
pi-pi
,
terminating
at
either
end
*NL*
in
a
lofty
terraced
altar
,
guarded
by
ranks
of
hideous
wooden
idols
,
and
*NL*
with
the
two
remaining
sides
flanked
by
ranges
of
bamboo
sheds
,
opening
*NL*
towards
the
interior
of
the
quadrangle
thus
formed
.
Vast
trees
,
standing
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
this
space
,
and
throwing
over
it
an
umbrageous
shade
,
*NL*
had
their
massive
trunks
built
round
with
slight
stages
,
elevated
a
few
*NL*
feet
above
the
ground
,
and
railed
in
with
canes
,
forming
so
many
rustic
*NL*
pulpits
,
from
which
the
priests
harangued
their
devotees
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
holiest
of
spots
was
defended
from
profanation
by
the
strictest
*NL*
edicts
of
the
all-pervading
`
taboo
'
,
which
condemned
to
instant
death
*NL*
the
sacrilegious
female
who
should
enter
or
touch
its
sacred
precincts
,
*NL*
or
even
so
much
as
press
with
her
feet
the
ground
made
holy
by
the
*NL*
shadows
that
it
cast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Access
was
had
to
the
enclosure
through
an
embowered
entrance
,
on
one
*NL*
side
,
facing
a
number
of
towering
cocoanut
trees
,
planted
at
intervals
*NL*
along
a
level
area
of
a
hundred
yards
.
At
the
further
extremity
of
this
*NL*
space
was
to
be
seen
a
building
of
considerable
size
,
reserved
for
the
*NL*
habitation
of
the
priests
and
religious
attendants
of
the
groves
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
its
vicinity
was
another
remarkable
edifice
,
built
as
usual
upon
the
*NL*
summit
of
a
pi-pi
,
and
at
least
two
hundred
feet
in
length
,
though
not
*NL*
more
than
twenty
in
breadth
.
The
whole
front
of
this
latter
structure
*NL*
was
completely
open
,
and
from
one
end
to
the
other
ran
a
narrow
*NL*
verandah
,
fenced
in
on
the
edge
of
the
pi-pi
with
a
picket
of
canes
.
*NL*
Its
interior
presented
the
appearance
of
an
immense
lounging
place
,
the
*NL*
entire
floor
being
strewn
with
successive
layers
of
mats
,
lying
between
*NL*
parallel
trunks
of
cocoanut
trees
,
selected
for
the
purpose
from
the
*NL*
straightest
and
most
symmetrical
the
vale
afforded
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
building
,
denominated
in
the
language
of
the
natives
the
`
Ti
'
,
*NL*
Mehevi
now
conducted
us
.
Thus
far
we
had
been
accompanied
by
a
troop
of
*NL*
the
natives
of
both
sexes
;
but
as
soon
as
we
approached
its
vicinity
,
*NL*
the
females
gradually
separated
themselves
from
the
crowd
,
and
standing
*NL*
aloof
,
permitted
us
to
pass
on
.
The
merciless
prohibitions
of
the
*NL*
taboo
extended
likewise
to
this
edifice
,
and
were
enforced
by
the
*NL*
same
dreadful
penalty
that
secured
the
Hoolah-Hoolah
ground
from
the
*NL*
imaginary
pollution
of
a
woman
's
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
the
house
,
I
was
surprised
to
see
six
muskets
ranged
against
*NL*
the
bamboo
on
one
side
,
from
the
barrels
of
which
depended
as
many
small
*NL*
canvas
pouches
,
partly
filled
with
powder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Disposed
about
these
muskets
,
like
the
cutlasses
that
decorate
the
*NL*
bulkhead
of
a
man-of-war
's
cabin
,
were
a
great
variety
of
rude
spears
*NL*
and
paddles
,
javelins
,
and
war-clubs
.
This
then
,
said
I
to
Toby
,
must
be
*NL*
the
armoury
of
the
tribe
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
advanced
further
along
the
building
,
we
were
struck
with
the
*NL*
aspect
of
four
or
five
hideous
old
wretches
,
on
whose
decrepit
forms
*NL*
time
and
tattooing
seemed
to
have
obliterated
every
trace
of
humanity
.
*NL*
Owing
to
the
continued
operation
of
this
latter
process
,
which
only
*NL*
terminates
among
the
warriors
of
the
island
after
all
the
figures
*NL*
stretched
upon
their
limbs
in
youth
have
been
blended
together
--
an
*NL*
effect
,
however
,
produced
only
in
cases
of
extreme
longevity
--
the
bodies
*NL*
of
these
men
were
of
a
uniform
dull
green
colour
--
the
hue
which
the
*NL*
tattooing
gradually
assumes
as
the
individual
advances
in
age
.
Their
*NL*
skin
had
a
frightful
scaly
appearance
,
which
,
united
with
its
singular
*NL*
colour
,
made
their
limbs
not
a
little
resemble
dusty
specimens
of
*NL*
verde-antique
.
Their
flesh
,
in
parts
,
hung
upon
them
in
huge
folds
,
like
*NL*
the
overlapping
plaits
on
the
flank
of
a
rhinoceros
.
Their
heads
were
*NL*
completely
bald
,
whilst
their
faces
were
puckered
into
a
thousand
*NL*
wrinkles
,
and
they
presented
no
vestige
of
a
beard
.
But
the
most
*NL*
remarkable
peculiarity
about
them
was
the
appearance
of
their
feet
;
*NL*
the
toes
,
like
the
radiating
lines
of
the
mariner
's
compass
,
pointed
*NL*
to
every
quarter
of
the
horizon
.
This
was
doubtless
attributable
to
*NL*
the
fact
,
that
during
nearly
a
hundred
years
of
existence
the
said
toes
*NL*
never
had
been
subjected
to
any
artificial
confinement
,
and
in
their
*NL*
old
age
,
being
averse
to
close
neighbourhood
,
bid
one
another
keep
open
*NL*
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
repulsive-looking
creatures
appeared
to
have
lost
the
use
of
their
*NL*
lower
limbs
altogether
;
sitting
upon
the
floor
cross-legged
in
a
state
*NL*
of
torpor
.
They
never
heeded
us
in
the
least
,
scarcely
looking
conscious
*NL*
of
our
presence
,
while
Mehevi
seated
us
upon
the
mats
,
and
Kory-Kory
*NL*
gave
utterance
to
some
unintelligible
gibberish
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
moments
a
boy
entered
with
a
wooden
trencher
of
poee-poee
;
and
*NL*
in
regaling
myself
with
its
contents
I
was
obliged
again
to
submit
to
*NL*
the
officious
intervention
of
my
indefatigable
servitor
.
Various
other
*NL*
dishes
followed
,
the
chief
manifesting
the
most
hospitable
importunity
*NL*
in
pressing
us
to
partake
,
and
to
remove
all
bashfulness
on
our
part
,
*NL*
set
us
no
despicable
example
in
his
own
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
repast
concluded
,
a
pipe
was
lighted
,
which
passed
from
mouth
to
*NL*
mouth
,
and
yielding
to
its
soporific
influence
,
the
quiet
of
the
place
,
*NL*
and
the
deepening
shadows
of
approaching
night
,
my
companion
and
I
sank
*NL*
into
a
kind
of
drowsy
repose
,
while
the
chief
and
Kory-Kory
seemed
to
be
*NL*
slumbering
beside
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
awoke
from
an
uneasy
nap
,
about
midnight
,
as
I
supposed
;
and
,
raising
*NL*
myself
partly
from
the
mat
,
became
sensible
that
we
were
enveloped
*NL*
in
utter
darkness
.
Toby
lay
still
asleep
,
but
our
late
companions
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
The
only
sound
that
interrupted
the
silence
of
the
place
*NL*
was
the
asthmatic
breathing
of
the
old
men
I
have
mentioned
,
who
reposed
*NL*
at
a
little
distance
from
us
.
Besides
them
,
as
well
as
I
could
judge
,
*NL*
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apprehensive
of
some
evil
,
I
roused
my
comrade
,
and
we
were
engaged
in
a
*NL*
whispered
conference
concerning
the
unexpected
withdrawal
of
the
natives
*NL*
when
all
at
once
,
from
the
depths
of
the
grove
,
in
full
view
of
us
*NL*
where
we
lay
,
shoots
of
flame
were
seen
to
rise
,
and
in
a
few
moments
*NL*
illuminated
the
surrounding
trees
,
casting
,
by
contrast
,
into
still
*NL*
deeper
gloom
the
darkness
around
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
we
continued
gazing
at
this
sight
,
dark
figures
appeared
moving
*NL*
to
and
fro
before
the
flames
;
while
others
,
dancing
and
capering
about
,
*NL*
looked
like
so
many
demons
.
*NL*
*NL*
Regarding
this
new
phenomenon
with
no
small
degree
of
trepidation
,
I
*NL*
said
to
my
companion
,
`
What
can
all
this
mean
,
Toby
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
nothing
,
'
replied
he
;
`
getting
the
fire
ready
,
I
suppose
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fire
!
'
exclaimed
I
,
while
my
heart
took
to
beating
like
a
trip-hammer
,
*NL*
`
what
fire
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
the
fire
to
cook
us
,
to
be
sure
,
what
else
would
the
cannibals
be
*NL*
kicking
up
such
a
row
about
if
it
were
not
for
that
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
,
Toby
!
have
done
with
your
jokes
;
this
is
no
time
for
them
;
*NL*
something
is
about
to
happen
,
I
feel
confident
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jokes
,
indeed
?
'
exclaimed
Toby
indignantly
.
`
Did
you
ever
hear
me
joke
?
*NL*
Why
,
for
what
do
you
suppose
the
devils
have
been
feeding
us
up
in
this
*NL*
kind
of
style
during
the
last
three
days
,
unless
it
were
for
something
*NL*
that
you
are
too
much
frightened
at
to
talk
about
?
Look
at
that
*NL*
Kory-Kory
there
!
--
has
he
not
been
stuffing
you
with
his
confounded
*NL*
mushes
,
just
in
the
way
they
treat
swine
before
they
kill
them
?
Depend
*NL*
upon
it
,
we
will
be
eaten
this
blessed
night
,
and
there
is
the
fire
we
*NL*
shall
be
roasted
by
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
view
of
the
matter
was
not
at
all
calculated
to
allay
my
*NL*
apprehensions
,
and
I
shuddered
when
I
reflected
that
we
were
indeed
at
*NL*
the
mercy
of
a
tribe
of
cannibals
,
and
that
the
dreadful
contingency
*NL*
to
which
Toby
had
alluded
was
by
no
means
removed
beyond
the
bounds
of
*NL*
possibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
!
I
told
you
so
!
they
are
coming
for
us
!
'
exclaimed
my
companion
*NL*
the
next
moment
,
as
the
forms
of
four
of
the
islanders
were
seen
in
*NL*
bold
relief
against
the
illuminated
back-ground
mounting
the
pi-pi
and
*NL*
approaching
towards
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
on
noiselessly
,
nay
stealthily
,
and
glided
along
through
the
*NL*
gloom
that
surrounded
us
as
if
about
to
spring
upon
some
object
they
*NL*
were
fearful
of
disturbing
before
they
should
make
sure
of
it
.
--
Gracious
*NL*
heaven
!
the
horrible
reflections
which
crowded
upon
me
that
moment
.
--
A
*NL*
cold
sweat
stood
upon
my
brow
,
and
spell-bound
with
terror
I
awaited
my
*NL*
fate
!
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
silence
was
broken
by
the
well-remembered
tones
of
Mehevi
,
*NL*
and
at
the
kindly
accents
of
his
voice
my
fears
were
immediately
*NL*
dissipated
.
`
Tommo
,
Toby
,
ki
ki
!
'
-LRB-
eat
-RRB-
.
He
had
waited
to
address
us
,
*NL*
until
he
had
assured
himself
that
we
were
both
awake
,
at
which
he
seemed
*NL*
somewhat
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Ki
ki
!
is
it
?
'
said
Toby
in
his
gruff
tones
;
`
Well
,
cook
us
first
,
will
*NL*
you
--
but
what
's
this
?
'
he
added
,
as
another
savage
appeared
,
bearing
*NL*
before
him
a
large
trencher
of
wood
containing
some
kind
of
steaming
*NL*
meat
,
as
appeared
from
the
odours
it
diffused
,
and
which
he
deposited
at
*NL*
the
feet
of
Mehevi
.
'
A
baked
baby
,
I
dare
say
I
but
I
will
have
none
*NL*
of
it
,
never
mind
what
it
is
.
--
A
pretty
fool
I
should
make
of
myself
,
*NL*
indeed
,
waked
up
here
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
stuffing
and
guzzling
,
*NL*
and
all
to
make
a
fat
meal
for
a
parcel
of
booby-minded
cannibals
one
*NL*
of
these
mornings
!
--
No
,
I
see
what
they
are
at
very
plainly
,
so
I
am
*NL*
resolved
to
starve
myself
into
a
bunch
of
bones
and
gristle
,
and
then
,
*NL*
if
they
serve
me
up
,
they
are
welcome
!
But
I
say
,
Tommo
,
you
are
not
*NL*
going
to
eat
any
of
that
mess
there
,
in
the
dark
,
are
you
?
Why
,
how
can
*NL*
you
tell
what
it
is
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
tasting
it
,
to
be
sure
,
'
said
I
,
masticating
a
morsel
that
Kory-Kory
*NL*
had
just
put
in
my
mouth
,
`
and
excellently
good
it
is
,
too
,
very
much
*NL*
like
veal
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
baked
baby
,
by
the
soul
of
Captain
Cook
!
'
burst
forth
Toby
,
with
*NL*
amazing
vehemence
;
`
Veal
?
why
there
never
was
a
calf
on
the
island
*NL*
till
you
landed
.
I
tell
you
you
are
bolting
down
mouthfuls
from
a
dead
*NL*
Happar
's
carcass
,
as
sure
as
you
live
,
and
no
mistake
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
Emetics
and
lukewarm
water
!
What
a
sensation
in
the
abdominal
region
!
*NL*
Sure
enough
,
where
could
the
fiends
incarnate
have
obtained
meat
?
But
I
*NL*
resolved
to
satisfy
myself
at
all
hazards
;
and
turning
to
Mehevi
,
I
soon
*NL*
made
the
ready
chief
understand
that
I
wished
a
light
to
be
brought
.
*NL*
When
the
taper
came
,
I
gazed
eagerly
into
the
vessel
,
and
recognized
the
*NL*
mutilated
remains
of
a
juvenile
porker
!
`
Puarkee
!
'
exclaimed
Kory-Kory
,
*NL*
looking
complacently
at
the
dish
;
and
from
that
day
to
this
I
have
never
*NL*
forgotten
that
such
is
the
designation
of
a
pig
in
the
Typee
lingo
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
after
being
again
abundantly
feasted
by
the
hospitable
*NL*
Mehevi
,
Toby
and
myself
arose
to
depart
.
But
the
chief
requested
us
to
*NL*
postpone
our
intention
.
`
Abo
,
abo
'
-LRB-
Wait
,
wait
-RRB-
,
he
said
and
accordingly
*NL*
we
resumed
our
seats
,
while
,
assisted
by
the
zealous
Kory-Kory
,
he
*NL*
appeared
to
be
engaged
in
giving
directions
to
a
number
of
the
natives
*NL*
outside
,
who
were
busily
employed
in
making
arrangements
,
the
nature
*NL*
of
which
we
could
not
comprehend
.
But
we
were
not
left
long
in
our
*NL*
ignorance
,
for
a
few
moments
only
had
elapsed
,
when
the
chief
beckoned
*NL*
us
to
approach
,
and
we
perceived
that
he
had
been
marshalling
a
kind
of
*NL*
guard
of
honour
to
escort
us
on
our
return
to
the
house
of
Marheyo
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
procession
was
led
off
by
two
venerable-looking
savages
,
each
*NL*
provided
with
a
spear
,
from
the
end
of
which
streamed
a
pennon
of
*NL*
milk-white
tappa
.
After
them
went
several
youths
,
bearing
aloft
*NL*
calabashes
of
poee-poee
,
and
followed
in
their
turn
by
four
stalwart
*NL*
fellows
,
sustaining
long
bamboos
,
from
the
tops
of
which
hung
*NL*
suspended
,
at
least
twenty
feet
from
the
ground
,
large
baskets
of
*NL*
green
bread-fruits
.
Then
came
a
troop
of
boys
,
carrying
bunches
of
ripe
*NL*
bananas
,
and
baskets
made
of
the
woven
leaflets
of
cocoanut
boughs
,
*NL*
filled
with
the
young
fruit
of
the
tree
,
the
naked
shells
stripped
of
*NL*
their
husks
peeping
forth
from
the
verdant
wicker-work
that
surrounded
*NL*
them
.
Last
of
all
came
a
burly
islander
,
holding
over
his
head
a
wooden
*NL*
trencher
,
in
which
lay
disposed
the
remnants
of
our
midnight
feast
,
*NL*
hidden
from
view
,
however
,
by
a
covering
of
bread-fruit
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Astonished
as
I
was
at
this
exhibition
,
I
could
not
avoid
smiling
at
*NL*
its
grotesque
appearance
,
and
the
associations
it
naturally
called
*NL*
up
.
Mehevi
,
it
seemed
,
was
bent
on
replenishing
old
Marheyo
's
larder
,
*NL*
fearful
perhaps
that
without
this
precaution
his
guests
might
not
fare
*NL*
as
well
as
they
could
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
descended
from
the
pi-pi
,
the
procession
formed
anew
,
*NL*
enclosing
us
in
its
centre
;
where
I
remained
part
of
the
time
,
carried
*NL*
by
Kory-Kory
,
and
occasionally
relieving
him
from
his
burden
by
limping
*NL*
along
with
spear
.
When
we
moved
off
in
this
order
,
the
natives
struck
*NL*
up
a
musical
recitative
,
which
with
various
alternations
,
they
continued
*NL*
until
we
arrived
at
the
place
of
our
destination
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
proceeded
on
our
way
,
bands
of
young
girls
,
darting
from
the
*NL*
surrounding
groves
,
hung
upon
our
skirts
,
and
accompanied
us
with
shouts
*NL*
of
merriment
and
delight
,
which
almost
drowned
the
deep
notes
of
the
*NL*
recitative
.
On
approaching
old
Marheyo
's
domicile
,
its
inmates
rushed
*NL*
out
to
receive
us
;
and
while
the
gifts
of
Mehevi
were
being
disposed
of
,
*NL*
the
superannuated
warrior
did
the
honours
of
his
mansion
with
all
the
*NL*
warmth
of
hospitality
evinced
by
an
English
squire
when
he
regales
his
*NL*
friends
at
some
fine
old
patrimonial
mansion
.

CHAPTER
THIRTEEN
*NL*
*NL*
ATTEMPT
TO
PROCURE
RELIEF
FROM
NUKUHEVA
--
PERILOUS
ADVENTURE
OF
TOBY
IN
*NL*
THE
HAPPAR
MOUNTAINS
--
ELOQUENCE
OF
KORY-KORY
*NL*
*NL*
AMIDST
these
novel
scenes
a
week
passed
away
almost
imperceptibly
.
The
*NL*
natives
,
actuated
by
some
mysterious
impulse
,
day
after
day
redoubled
*NL*
their
attentions
to
us
.
Their
manner
towards
us
was
unaccountable
.
*NL*
Surely
,
thought
I
,
they
would
not
act
thus
if
they
meant
us
any
harm
.
*NL*
But
why
this
excess
of
deferential
kindness
,
or
what
equivalent
can
they
*NL*
imagine
us
capable
of
rendering
them
for
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
were
fairly
puzzled
.
But
despite
the
apprehensions
I
could
not
*NL*
dispel
,
the
horrible
character
imputed
to
these
Typees
appeared
to
be
*NL*
wholly
undeserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
,
they
are
cannibals
!
'
said
Toby
on
one
occasion
when
I
eulogized
*NL*
the
tribe
.
`
Granted
,
'
I
replied
,
`
but
a
more
humane
,
gentlemanly
and
*NL*
amiable
set
of
epicures
do
not
probably
exist
in
the
Pacific
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
notwithstanding
the
kind
treatment
we
received
,
I
was
too
familiar
*NL*
with
the
fickle
disposition
of
savages
not
to
feel
anxious
to
withdraw
*NL*
from
the
valley
,
and
put
myself
beyond
the
reach
of
that
fearful
death
*NL*
which
,
under
all
these
smiling
appearances
,
might
yet
menace
us
.
But
*NL*
here
there
was
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
doing
so
.
It
was
idle
for
me
*NL*
to
think
of
moving
from
the
place
until
I
should
have
recovered
from
the
*NL*
severe
lameness
that
afflicted
me
;
indeed
my
malady
began
seriously
to
*NL*
alarm
me
;
for
,
despite
the
herbal
remedies
of
the
natives
,
it
continued
*NL*
to
grow
worse
and
worse
.
Their
mild
applications
,
though
they
soothed
*NL*
the
pain
,
did
not
remove
the
disorder
,
and
I
felt
convinced
that
without
*NL*
better
aid
I
might
anticipate
long
and
acute
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
was
this
aid
to
be
procured
?
From
the
surgeons
of
the
French
*NL*
fleet
,
which
probably
still
lay
in
the
bay
of
Nukuheva
,
it
might
easily
*NL*
have
been
obtained
,
could
I
have
made
my
case
known
to
them
.
But
how
*NL*
could
that
be
effected
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
in
the
exigency
to
which
I
was
reduced
,
I
proposed
to
Toby
that
*NL*
he
should
endeavour
to
go
round
to
Nukuheva
,
and
if
he
could
not
*NL*
succeed
in
returning
to
the
valley
by
water
,
in
one
of
the
boats
of
the
*NL*
squadron
,
and
taking
me
off
,
he
might
at
least
procure
me
some
proper
*NL*
medicines
,
and
effect
his
return
overland
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
listened
to
me
in
silence
,
and
at
first
did
not
appear
to
*NL*
relish
the
idea
.
The
truth
was
,
he
felt
impatient
to
escape
from
the
*NL*
place
,
and
wished
to
avail
himself
of
our
present
high
favour
with
*NL*
the
natives
to
make
good
our
retreat
,
before
we
should
experience
some
*NL*
sudden
alteration
in
their
behaviour
.
As
he
could
not
think
of
leaving
*NL*
me
in
my
helpless
condition
,
he
implored
me
to
be
of
good
cheer
;
assured
*NL*
me
that
I
should
soon
be
better
,
and
enabled
in
a
few
days
to
return
*NL*
with
him
to
Nukuheva
.
*NL*
*NL*
Added
to
this
,
he
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
again
returning
to
this
*NL*
dangerous
place
;
and
as
for
the
expectation
of
persuading
the
Frenchmen
*NL*
to
detach
a
boat
's
crew
for
the
purpose
of
rescuing
me
from
the
Typees
,
*NL*
he
looked
upon
it
as
idle
;
and
with
arguments
that
I
could
not
answer
,
*NL*
urged
the
improbability
of
their
provoking
the
hostilities
of
the
clan
*NL*
by
any
such
measure
;
especially
,
as
for
the
purpose
of
quieting
its
*NL*
apprehensions
,
they
had
as
yet
refrained
from
making
any
visit
to
the
*NL*
bay
.
`
And
even
should
they
consent
,
'
said
Toby
,
`
they
would
only
produce
*NL*
a
commotion
in
the
valley
,
in
which
we
might
both
be
sacrificed
by
these
*NL*
ferocious
islanders
.
'
This
was
unanswerable
;
but
still
I
clung
to
the
*NL*
belief
that
he
might
succeed
in
accomplishing
the
other
part
of
my
plan
;
*NL*
and
at
last
I
overcame
his
scruples
,
and
he
agreed
to
make
the
attempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
we
succeeded
in
making
the
natives
understand
our
intention
,
*NL*
they
broke
out
into
the
most
vehement
opposition
to
the
measure
,
and
*NL*
for
a
while
I
almost
despaired
of
obtaining
their
consent
.
At
the
bare
*NL*
thought
of
one
of
us
leaving
them
,
they
manifested
the
most
lively
*NL*
concern
.
The
grief
and
consternation
of
Kory-Kory
,
in
particular
,
was
*NL*
unbounded
;
he
threw
himself
into
a
perfect
paroxysm
of
gestures
which
*NL*
were
intended
to
convey
to
us
not
only
his
abhorrence
of
Nukuheva
*NL*
and
its
uncivilized
inhabitants
,
but
also
his
astonishment
that
after
*NL*
becoming
acquainted
with
the
enlightened
Typees
,
we
should
evince
the
*NL*
least
desire
to
withdraw
,
even
for
a
time
,
from
their
agreeable
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
I
overbore
his
objections
by
appealing
to
my
lameness
;
from
*NL*
which
I
assured
the
natives
I
should
speedily
recover
if
Toby
were
*NL*
permitted
to
obtain
the
supplies
I
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
agreed
that
on
the
following
morning
my
companion
should
depart
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
some
one
or
two
of
the
household
,
who
should
point
out
to
*NL*
him
an
easy
route
,
by
which
the
bay
might
be
reached
before
sunset
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
early
dawn
of
the
next
day
,
our
habitation
was
astir
.
One
of
the
*NL*
young
men
mounted
into
an
adjoining
cocoanut
tree
,
and
threw
down
a
*NL*
number
of
the
young
fruit
,
which
old
Marheyo
quickly
stripped
of
the
*NL*
green
husks
,
and
strung
together
upon
a
short
pole
.
These
were
intended
*NL*
to
refresh
Toby
on
his
route
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
preparations
being
completed
,
with
no
little
emotion
I
bade
my
*NL*
companion
adieu
.
He
promised
to
return
in
three
days
at
farthest
;
and
,
*NL*
bidding
me
keep
up
my
spirits
in
the
interval
,
turned
round
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
pi-pi
,
and
,
under
the
guidance
of
the
venerable
Marheyo
,
was
*NL*
soon
out
of
sight
.
His
departure
oppressed
me
with
melancholy
,
and
,
*NL*
re-entering
the
dwelling
,
I
threw
myself
almost
in
despair
upon
the
*NL*
matting
of
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
two
hours
'
time
the
old
warrior
returned
,
and
gave
me
to
understand
*NL*
that
after
accompanying
my
companion
a
little
distance
,
and
showing
him
*NL*
the
route
,
he
had
left
him
journeying
on
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
noon
of
this
same
day
,
a
season
which
these
people
are
wont
*NL*
to
pass
in
sleep
,
that
I
lay
in
the
house
,
surrounded
by
its
slumbering
*NL*
inmates
,
and
painfully
affected
by
the
strange
silence
which
prevailed
.
*NL*
All
at
once
I
thought
I
heard
a
faint
shout
,
as
if
proceeding
from
*NL*
some
persons
in
the
depth
of
the
grove
which
extended
in
front
of
our
*NL*
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sounds
grew
louder
and
nearer
,
and
gradually
the
whole
valley
rang
*NL*
with
wild
outcries
.
The
sleepers
around
me
started
to
their
feet
in
*NL*
alarm
,
and
hurried
outside
to
discover
the
cause
of
the
commotion
.
*NL*
Kory-Kory
,
who
had
been
the
first
to
spring
up
,
soon
returned
almost
*NL*
breathless
,
and
nearly
frantic
with
the
excitement
under
which
he
seemed
*NL*
to
be
labouring
.
All
that
I
could
understand
from
him
was
that
some
*NL*
accident
had
happened
to
Toby
.
Apprehensive
of
some
dreadful
calamity
,
*NL*
I
rushed
out
of
the
house
,
and
caught
sight
of
a
tumultuous
crowd
,
who
,
*NL*
with
shrieks
and
lamentations
,
were
just
emerging
from
the
grove
*NL*
bearing
in
their
arms
some
object
,
the
sight
of
which
produced
all
this
*NL*
transport
of
sorrow
.
As
they
drew
near
,
the
men
redoubled
their
*NL*
cries
,
while
the
girls
,
tossing
their
bare
arms
in
the
air
,
exclaimed
*NL*
plaintively
,
`
Awha
!
awha
!
Toby
mukee
moee
!
'
--
Alas
!
alas
!
Toby
is
killed
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
the
crowd
opened
,
and
disclosed
the
apparently
lifeless
body
*NL*
of
my
companion
home
between
two
men
,
the
head
hanging
heavily
against
*NL*
the
breast
of
the
foremost
.
The
whole
face
,
neck
,
back
,
and
bosom
were
*NL*
covered
with
blood
,
which
still
trickled
slowly
from
a
wound
behind
the
*NL*
temple
.
In
the
midst
of
the
greatest
uproar
and
confusion
the
body
was
*NL*
carried
into
the
house
and
laid
on
a
mat
.
Waving
the
natives
off
to
give
*NL*
room
and
air
,
I
bent
eagerly
over
Toby
,
and
,
laying
my
hand
upon
the
*NL*
breast
,
ascertained
that
the
heart
still
beat
.
Overjoyed
at
this
,
I
*NL*
seized
a
calabash
of
water
,
and
dashed
its
contents
upon
his
face
,
then
*NL*
wiping
away
the
blood
,
anxiously
examined
the
wound
.
It
was
about
three
*NL*
inches
long
,
and
on
removing
the
clotted
hair
from
about
it
,
showed
the
*NL*
skull
laid
completely
bare
.
Immediately
with
my
knife
I
cut
away
the
*NL*
heavy
locks
,
and
bathed
the
part
repeatedly
in
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
moments
Toby
revived
,
and
opening
his
eyes
for
a
second
--
closed
*NL*
them
again
without
speaking
.
Kory-Kory
,
who
had
been
kneeling
beside
me
,
*NL*
now
chafed
his
limbs
gently
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
,
while
a
young
*NL*
girl
at
his
head
kept
fanning
him
,
and
I
still
continued
to
moisten
his
*NL*
lips
and
brow
.
Soon
my
poor
comrade
showed
signs
of
animation
,
and
I
*NL*
succeeded
in
making
him
swallow
from
a
cocoanut
shell
a
few
mouthfuls
of
*NL*
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Tinor
now
appeared
,
holding
in
her
hand
some
simples
she
had
*NL*
gathered
,
the
juice
of
which
she
by
signs
besought
me
to
squeeze
into
*NL*
the
wound
.
Having
done
so
,
I
thought
it
best
to
leave
Toby
undisturbed
*NL*
until
he
should
have
had
time
to
rally
his
faculties
.
Several
times
he
*NL*
opened
his
lips
,
but
fearful
for
his
safety
I
enjoined
silence
.
In
the
*NL*
course
of
two
or
three
hours
,
however
,
he
sat
up
,
and
was
sufficiently
*NL*
recovered
to
tell
me
what
had
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
leaving
the
house
with
Marheyo
,
'
said
Toby
,
`
we
struck
across
the
*NL*
valley
,
and
ascended
the
opposite
heights
.
Just
beyond
them
,
my
guide
*NL*
informed
me
,
lay
the
valley
of
Happar
,
while
along
their
summits
,
and
*NL*
skirting
the
head
of
the
vale
,
was
my
route
to
Nukuheva
.
After
mounting
*NL*
a
little
way
up
the
elevation
my
guide
paused
,
and
gave
me
to
understand
*NL*
that
he
could
not
accompany
me
any
farther
,
and
by
various
signs
*NL*
intimated
that
he
was
afraid
to
approach
any
nearer
the
territories
of
*NL*
the
enemies
of
his
tribe
.
He
however
pointed
out
my
path
,
which
now
*NL*
lay
clearly
before
me
,
and
bidding
me
farewell
,
hastily
descended
the
*NL*
mountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
elated
at
being
so
near
the
Happars
,
I
pushed
up
the
acclivity
,
*NL*
and
soon
gained
its
summit
.
It
tapered
to
a
sharp
ridge
,
from
whence
*NL*
I
beheld
both
the
hostile
valleys
.
Here
I
sat
down
and
rested
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
refreshing
myself
with
my
cocoanuts
.
I
was
soon
again
pursuing
*NL*
my
way
along
the
height
,
when
suddenly
I
saw
three
of
the
islanders
,
who
*NL*
must
have
just
come
out
of
Happar
valley
,
standing
in
the
path
ahead
of
*NL*
me
.
They
were
each
armed
with
a
heavy
spear
,
and
one
from
his
appearance
*NL*
I
took
to
be
a
chief
.
They
sung
out
something
,
I
could
not
understand
*NL*
what
,
and
beckoned
me
to
come
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Without
the
least
hesitation
I
advanced
towards
them
,
and
had
*NL*
approached
within
about
a
yard
of
the
foremost
,
when
,
pointing
angrily
*NL*
into
the
Typee
valley
,
and
uttering
some
savage
exclamation
,
he
wheeled
*NL*
round
his
weapon
like
lightning
,
and
struck
me
in
a
moment
to
the
*NL*
ground
.
The
blow
inflicted
this
wound
,
and
took
away
my
senses
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
I
came
to
myself
,
I
perceived
the
three
islanders
standing
a
little
*NL*
distance
off
,
and
apparently
engaged
in
some
violent
altercation
*NL*
respecting
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
first
impulse
was
to
run
for
it
;
but
,
in
endeavouring
to
rise
,
I
*NL*
fell
back
,
and
rolled
down
a
little
grassy
precipice
.
The
shock
seemed
*NL*
to
rally
my
faculties
;
so
,
starting
to
my
feet
,
I
fled
down
the
path
I
*NL*
had
just
ascended
.
I
had
no
need
to
look
behind
me
,
for
,
from
the
yells
*NL*
I
heard
,
I
knew
that
my
enemies
were
in
full
pursuit
.
Urged
on
by
their
*NL*
fearful
outcries
,
and
heedless
of
the
injury
I
had
received
--
though
*NL*
the
blood
flowing
from
the
wound
trickled
over
into
my
eyes
and
almost
*NL*
blinded
me
--
I
rushed
down
the
mountain
side
with
the
speed
of
the
wind
.
*NL*
In
a
short
time
I
had
descended
nearly
a
third
of
the
distance
,
and
the
*NL*
savages
had
ceased
their
cries
,
when
suddenly
a
terrific
howl
burst
upon
*NL*
my
ear
,
and
at
the
same
moment
a
heavy
javelin
darted
past
me
as
I
fled
,
*NL*
and
stuck
quivering
in
a
tree
close
to
me
.
Another
yell
followed
,
and
*NL*
a
second
spear
and
a
third
shot
through
the
air
within
a
few
feet
of
my
*NL*
body
,
both
of
them
piercing
the
ground
obliquely
in
advance
of
me
.
The
*NL*
fellows
gave
a
roar
of
rage
and
disappointment
;
but
they
were
afraid
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
of
coming
down
further
into
the
Typee
valley
,
and
so
abandoned
*NL*
the
chase
.
I
saw
them
recover
their
weapons
and
turn
back
;
and
I
*NL*
continued
my
descent
as
fast
as
I
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
could
have
caused
this
ferocious
attack
on
the
part
of
these
*NL*
Happars
I
could
not
imagine
,
unless
it
were
that
they
had
seen
me
*NL*
ascending
the
mountain
with
Marheyo
,
and
that
the
mere
fact
of
coming
*NL*
from
the
Typee
valley
was
sufficient
to
provoke
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
long
as
I
was
in
danger
I
scarcely
felt
the
wound
I
had
received
;
*NL*
but
when
the
chase
was
over
I
began
to
suffer
from
it
.
I
had
lost
my
*NL*
hat
in
the
flight
,
and
the
run
scorched
my
bare
head
.
I
felt
faint
*NL*
and
giddy
;
but
,
fearful
of
falling
to
the
ground
beyond
the
reach
of
*NL*
assistance
,
I
staggered
on
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
at
last
gained
the
*NL*
level
of
the
valley
,
and
then
down
I
sank
;
and
I
knew
nothing
more
until
*NL*
I
found
myself
lying
upon
these
mats
,
and
you
stooping
over
me
with
the
*NL*
calabash
of
water
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
Toby
's
account
of
this
sad
affair
.
I
afterwards
learned
that
,
*NL*
fortunately
,
he
had
fallen
close
to
a
spot
where
the
natives
go
for
*NL*
fuel
.
A
party
of
them
caught
sight
of
him
as
he
fell
,
and
sounding
*NL*
the
alarm
,
had
lifted
him
up
;
and
after
ineffectually
endeavouring
to
*NL*
restore
him
at
the
brook
,
had
hurried
forward
with
him
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
incident
threw
a
dark
cloud
over
our
prospects
.
It
reminded
us
that
*NL*
we
were
hemmed
in
by
hostile
tribes
,
whose
territories
we
could
not
hope
*NL*
to
pass
,
on
our
route
to
Nukuheva
,
without
encountering
the
effects
of
*NL*
their
savage
resentment
.
There
appeared
to
be
no
avenue
opened
to
our
*NL*
escape
but
the
sea
,
which
washed
the
lower
extremities
of
the
vale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
Typee
friends
availed
themselves
of
the
recent
disaster
of
Toby
to
*NL*
exhort
us
to
a
due
appreciation
of
the
blessings
we
enjoyed
among
them
,
*NL*
contrasting
their
own
generous
reception
of
us
with
the
animosity
of
*NL*
their
neighbours
.
They
likewise
dwelt
upon
the
cannibal
propensities
of
*NL*
the
Happars
,
a
subject
which
they
were
perfectly
aware
could
not
fail
*NL*
to
alarm
us
;
while
at
the
same
time
they
earnestly
disclaimed
all
*NL*
participation
in
so
horrid
a
custom
.
Nor
did
they
omit
to
call
upon
*NL*
us
to
admire
the
natural
loveliness
of
their
own
abode
,
and
the
lavish
*NL*
abundance
with
which
it
produced
all
manner
of
luxuriant
fruits
;
*NL*
exalting
it
in
this
particular
above
any
of
the
surrounding
valleys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kory-Kory
seemed
to
experience
so
heartfelt
a
desire
to
infuse
into
our
*NL*
minds
proper
views
on
these
subjects
,
that
,
assisted
in
his
endeavours
*NL*
by
the
little
knowledge
of
the
language
we
had
acquired
,
he
actually
*NL*
made
us
comprehend
a
considerable
part
of
what
he
said
.
To
facilitate
*NL*
our
correct
apprehension
of
his
meaning
,
he
at
first
condensed
his
ideas
*NL*
into
the
smallest
possible
compass
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Happar
keekeeno
nuee
,
'
he
exclaimed
,
`
nuee
,
nuee
,
ki
ki
*NL*
kannaka
!
--
ah
!
owle
motarkee
!
'
which
signifies
,
`
Terrible
fellows
those
*NL*
Happars
!
--
devour
an
amazing
quantity
of
men
!
--
ah
,
shocking
bad
!
'
*NL*
Thus
far
he
explained
himself
by
a
variety
of
gestures
,
during
*NL*
the
performance
of
which
he
would
dart
out
of
the
house
,
and
point
*NL*
abhorrently
towards
the
Happar
valley
;
running
in
to
us
again
with
*NL*
a
rapidity
that
showed
he
was
fearful
he
would
lose
one
part
of
*NL*
his
meaning
before
he
could
complete
the
other
;
and
continuing
his
*NL*
illustrations
by
seizing
the
fleshy
part
of
my
arm
in
his
teeth
,
*NL*
intimating
by
the
operation
that
the
people
who
lived
over
in
that
*NL*
direction
would
like
nothing
better
than
to
treat
me
in
that
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
assured
himself
that
we
were
fully
enlightened
on
this
point
,
he
*NL*
proceeded
to
another
branch
of
his
subject
.
`
Ah
!
Typee
mortakee
!
--
nuee
,
*NL*
nuee
mioree
--
nuee
,
nuee

--

--
ah

*NL*
nuee
,
nuee

--
ah
!
nuee
,
nuee
,

'
Which
literally
interpreted
*NL*
as
before
,
would
imply
,
`
Ah
,
Typee
!
is
n't
it
a
fine
place
though
!
--
no
*NL*
danger
of
starving

,
I
tell
you
!
--
plenty
of
bread-fruit
--
plenty
of
*NL*
water
--
plenty
of
pudding
--
ah
!
plenty
of
everything
!
ah
!
heaps
,
heaps
*NL*
heaps
!
'
All
this
was
accompanied
by
a
running
commentary
of
signs
and
*NL*
gestures
which
it
was
impossible
not
to
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
continued
his
harangue
,
however
,
Kory-Kory
,
in
emulation
of
our
*NL*
more
polished
orators
,
began
to
launch
out
rather
diffusely
into
other
*NL*
branches
of
his
subject
,
enlarging
probably
upon
the
moral
reflections
*NL*
it
suggested
;
and
proceeded
in
such
a
strain
of
unintelligible
and
*NL*
stunning
gibberish
,
that
he
actually
gave
me
the
headache
for
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
day
.

*NL*
*NL*
IN
the
course
of
a
few
days
Toby
had
recovered
from
the
effects
of
*NL*
his
adventure
with
the
Happar
warriors
;
the
wound
on
his
head
rapidly
*NL*
healing
under
the
vegetable
treatment
of
the
good
Tinor
.
Less
fortunate
*NL*
than
my
companion
however
,
I
still
continued
to
languish
under
a
*NL*
complaint
,
the
origin
and
nature
of
which
were
still
a
mystery
.
Cut
off
*NL*
as
I
was
from
all
intercourse
with
the
civilized
world
,
and
feeling
the
*NL*
inefficacy
of
anything
the
natives
could
do
to
relieve
me
;
knowing
,
*NL*
too
,
that
so
long
as
I
remained
in
my
present
condition
,
it
would
*NL*
be
impossible
for
me
to
leave
the
valley
,
whatever
opportunity
might
*NL*
present
itself
;
and
apprehensive
that
ere
long
we
might
be
exposed
to
*NL*
some
caprice
on
the
part
of
the
islanders
,
I
now
gave
up
all
hopes
*NL*
of
recovery
,
and
became
a
prey
to
the
most
gloomy
thoughts
.
A
deep
*NL*
dejection
fell
upon
me
,
which
neither
the
friendly
remonstrances
of
*NL*
my
companion
,
the
devoted
attentions
of
Kory-Kory
nor
all
the
soothing
*NL*
influences
of
Fayaway
could
remove
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
as
I
lay
on
the
mats
in
the
house
,
plunged
in
melancholy
*NL*
reverie
,
and
regardless
of
everything
around
me
,
Toby
,
who
had
left
me
*NL*
about
an
hour
,
returned
in
haste
,
and
with
great
glee
told
me
to
cheer
*NL*
up
and
be
of
good
heart
;
for
he
believed
,
from
what
was
going
on
among
*NL*
the
natives
,
that
there
were
boats
approaching
the
bay
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
tidings
operated
upon
me
like
magic
.
The
hour
of
our
deliverance
*NL*
was
at
hand
,
and
starting
up
,
I
was
soon
convinced
that
something
*NL*
unusual
was
about
to
occur
.
The
word
`
botee
!
botee
!
'
was
vociferated
in
*NL*
all
directions
;
and
shouts
were
heard
in
the
distance
,
at
first
*NL*
feebly
and
faintly
;
but
growing
louder
and
nearer
at
each
successive
*NL*
repetition
,
until
they
were
caught
up
by
a
fellow
in
a
cocoanut
tree
a
*NL*
few
yards
off
,
who
sounding
them
in
turn
,
they
were
reiterated
from
a
*NL*
neighbouring
grove
,
and
so
died
away
gradually
from
point
to
point
,
as
*NL*
the
intelligence
penetrated
into
the
farthest
recess
of
the
valley
.
This
*NL*
was
the
vocal
telegraph
of
the
islanders
;
by
means
of
which
condensed
*NL*
items
of
information
could
be
carried
in
a
very
few
minutes
from
the
*NL*
sea
to
their
remotest
habitation
,
a
distance
of
at
least
eight
or
nine
*NL*
miles
.
On
the
present
occasion
it
was
in
active
operation
;
one
piece
of
*NL*
information
following
another
with
inconceivable
rapidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greatest
commotion
now
appeared
to
prevail
.
At
every
fresh
item
of
*NL*
intelligence
the
natives
betrayed
the
liveliest
interest
,
and
redoubled
*NL*
the
energy
with
which
they
employed
themselves
in
collecting
fruit
to
*NL*
sell
to
the
expected
visitors
.
Some
were
tearing
off
the
husks
from
*NL*
cocoanuts
;
some
perched
in
the
trees
were
throwing
down
bread-fruit
*NL*
to
their
companions
,
who
gathered
them
into
heaps
as
they
fell
;
while
*NL*
others
were
plying
their
fingers
rapidly
in
weaving
leafen
baskets
in
*NL*
which
to
carry
the
fruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
other
matters
too
going
on
at
the
same
time
.
Here
you
would
*NL*
see
a
stout
warrior
polishing
his
spear
with
a
bit
of
old
tappa
,
or
*NL*
adjusting
the
folds
of
the
girdle
about
his
waist
;
and
there
you
might
*NL*
descry
a
young
damsel
decorating
herself
with
flowers
,
as
if
having
*NL*
in
her
eye
some
maidenly
conquest
;
while
,
as
in
all
cases
of
hurry
*NL*
and
confusion
in
every
part
of
the
world
,
a
number
of
individuals
kept
*NL*
hurrying
to
and
fro
,
with
amazing
vigour
and
perseverance
,
doing
nothing
*NL*
themselves
,
and
hindering
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
before
had
we
seen
the
islanders
in
such
a
state
of
bustle
and
*NL*
excitement
;
and
the
scene
furnished
abundant
evidence
of
the
fact
--
that
*NL*
it
was
only
at
long
intervals
any
such
events
occur
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
thought
of
the
length
of
time
that
might
intervene
before
a
*NL*
similar
chance
of
escape
would
be
presented
,
I
bitterly
lamented
that
*NL*
I
had
not
the
power
of
availing
myself
effectually
of
the
present
*NL*
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
all
that
we
could
gather
,
it
appeared
that
the
natives
were
fearful
*NL*
of
arriving
too
late
upon
the
beach
,
unless
they
made
extraordinary
*NL*
exertions
.
Sick
and
lame
as
I
was
,
I
would
have
started
with
Toby
at
*NL*
once
,
had
not
Kory-Kory
not
only
refused
to
carry
me
,
but
manifested
*NL*
the
most
invincible
repugnance
to
our
leaving
the
neighbourhood
of
the
*NL*
house
.
The
rest
of
the
savages
were
equally
opposed
to
our
wishes
,
and
*NL*
seemed
grieved
and
astonished
at
the
earnestness
of
my
solicitations
.
*NL*
I
clearly
perceived
that
while
my
attendant
avoided
all
appearance
of
*NL*
constraining
my
movements
,
he
was
nevertheless
determined
to
thwart
my
*NL*
wishes
.
He
seemed
to
me
on
this
particular
occasion
,
as
well
as
often
*NL*
afterwards
,
to
be
executing
the
orders
of
some
other
person
with
regard
*NL*
to
me
,
though
at
the
same
time
feeling
towards
me
the
most
lively
*NL*
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
,
who
had
made
up
his
mind
to
accompany
the
islanders
if
possible
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
they
were
in
readiness
to
depart
,
and
who
for
that
reason
had
*NL*
refrained
from
showing
the
same
anxiety
that
I
had
done
,
now
represented
*NL*
to
me
that
it
was
idle
for
me
to
entertain
the
hope
of
reaching
the
*NL*
beach
in
time
to
profit
by
any
opportunity
that
might
then
be
presented
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Do
you
not
see
,
'
said
he
,
`
the
savages
themselves
are
fearful
of
being
*NL*
too
late
,
and
I
should
hurry
forward
myself
at
once
did
I
not
think
that
*NL*
if
I
showed
too
much
eagerness
I
should
destroy
all
our
hopes
of
reaping
*NL*
any
benefit
from
this
fortunate
event
.
If
you
will
only
endeavour
to
*NL*
appear
tranquil
or
unconcerned
,
you
will
quiet
their
suspicions
,
and
I
*NL*
have
no
doubt
they
will
then
let
me
go
with
them
to
the
beach
,
supposing
*NL*
that
I
merely
go
out
of
curiosity
.
Should
I
succeed
in
getting
down
to
*NL*
the
boats
,
I
will
make
known
the
condition
in
which
I
have
left
you
,
and
*NL*
measures
may
then
be
taken
to
secure
our
escape
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
expediency
of
this
I
could
not
but
acquiesce
;
and
as
the
natives
*NL*
had
now
completed
their
preparations
,
I
watched
with
the
liveliest
*NL*
interest
the
reception
that
Toby
's
application
might
meet
with
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
they
understood
from
my
companion
that
I
intended
to
remain
,
they
*NL*
appeared
to
make
no
objection
to
his
proposition
,
and
even
hailed
it
*NL*
with
pleasure
.
Their
singular
conduct
on
this
occasion
not
a
little
*NL*
puzzled
me
at
the
time
,
and
imparted
to
subsequent
events
an
additional
*NL*
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
islanders
were
now
to
be
seen
hurrying
along
the
path
which
led
to
*NL*
the
sea
.
I
shook
Toby
warmly
by
the
hand
,
and
gave
him
my
Payta
hat
*NL*
to
shield
his
wounded
head
from
the
sun
,
as
he
had
lost
his
own
.
He
*NL*
cordially
returned
the
pressure
of
my
hand
,
and
solemnly
promising
to
*NL*
return
as
soon
as
the
boats
should
leave
the
shore
,
sprang
from
my
side
,
*NL*
and
the
next
minute
disappeared
in
a
turn
of
the
grove
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
unpleasant
reflections
that
crowded
upon
my
mind
,
I
*NL*
could
not
but
be
entertained
by
the
novel
and
animated
sight
which
by
*NL*
now
met
my
view
.
One
after
another
the
natives
crowded
along
the
narrow
*NL*
path
,
laden
with
every
variety
of
fruit
.
Here
,
you
might
have
seen
one
,
*NL*
who
,
after
ineffectually
endeavouring
to
persuade
a
surly
porker
to
be
*NL*
conducted
in
leading
strings
,
was
obliged
at
last
to
seize
the
perverse
*NL*
animal
in
his
arms
,
and
carry
him
struggling
against
his
naked
breast
,
*NL*
and
squealing
without
intermission
.
There
went
two
,
who
at
a
little
*NL*
distance
might
have
been
taken
for
the
Hebrew
spies
,
on
their
return
to
*NL*
Moses
with
the
goodly
bunch
of
grape
.
One
trotted
before
the
other
at
a
*NL*
distance
of
a
couple
of
yards
,
while
between
them
,
from
a
pole
resting
*NL*
on
the
shoulders
,
was
suspended
a
huge
cluster
of
bananas
,
which
swayed
*NL*
to
and
fro
with
the
rocking
gait
at
which
they
proceeded
.
Here
ran
*NL*
another
,
perspiring
with
his
exertions
,
and
bearing
before
him
a
*NL*
quantity
of
cocoanuts
,
who
,
fearful
of
being
too
late
,
heeded
not
the
*NL*
fruit
that
dropped
from
his
basket
,
and
appeared
solely
intent
upon
*NL*
reaching
his
destination
,
careless
how
many
of
his
cocoanuts
kept
*NL*
company
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
short
time
the
last
straggler
was
seen
hurrying
on
his
way
,
and
the
*NL*
faint
shouts
of
those
in
advance
died
insensibly
upon
the
ear
.
Our
*NL*
part
of
the
valley
now
appeared
nearly
deserted
by
its
inhabitants
,
*NL*
Kory-Kory
,
his
aged
father
,
and
a
few
decrepit
old
people
,
being
all
*NL*
that
were
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
sunset
the
islanders
in
small
parties
began
to
return
from
*NL*
the
beach
,
and
among
them
,
as
they
drew
near
to
the
house
,
I
sought
to
*NL*
descry
the
form
of
my
companion
.
But
one
after
another
they
passed
the
*NL*
dwelling
,
and
I
caught
no
glimpse
of
him
.
Supposing
,
however
,
that
he
*NL*
would
soon
appear
with
some
of
the
members
of
the
household
,
I
quieted
*NL*
my
apprehensions
,
and
waited
patiently
to
see
him
advancing
in
company
*NL*
with
the
beautiful
Fayaway
.
At
last
,
I
perceived
Tinor
coming
forward
,
*NL*
followed
by
the
girls
and
young
men
who
usually
resided
in
the
house
of
*NL*
Marheyo
;
but
with
them
came
not
my
comrade
,
and
,
filled
with
a
thousand
*NL*
alarms
,
I
eagerly
sought
to
discover
the
cause
of
his
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
earnest
questions
appeared
to
embarrass
the
natives
greatly
.
All
*NL*
their
accounts
were
contradictory
:
one
giving
me
to
understand
that
*NL*
Toby
would
be
with
me
in
a
very
short
time
;
another
that
he
did
not
know
*NL*
where
he
was
;
while
a
third
,
violently
inveighing
,
against
him
,
assured
*NL*
me
that
he
had
stolen
away
,
and
would
never
come
back
.
It
appeared
*NL*
to
me
,
at
the
time
,
that
in
making
these
various
statements
they
*NL*
endeavoured
to
conceal
from
me
some
terrible
disaster
,
lest
the
*NL*
knowledge
of
it
should
overpower
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fearful
lest
some
fatal
calamity
had
overtaken
him
,
I
sought
out
young
*NL*
Fayaway
,
and
endeavoured
to
learn
from
her
,
if
possible
,
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gentle
being
had
early
attracted
my
regard
,
not
only
from
her
*NL*
extraordinary
beauty
,
but
from
the
attractive
cast
of
her
countenance
,
*NL*
singularly
expressive
of
intelligence
and
humanity
.
Of
all
the
natives
*NL*
she
alone
seemed
to
appreciate
the
effect
which
the
peculiarity
of
the
*NL*
circumstances
in
which
we
were
placed
had
produced
upon
the
minds
of
my
*NL*
companion
and
myself
.
In
addressing
me
--
especially
when
I
lay
reclining
*NL*
upon
the
mats
suffering
from
pain
--
there
was
a
tenderness
in
her
manner
*NL*
which
it
was
impossible
to
misunderstand
or
resist
.
Whenever
she
entered
*NL*
the
house
,
the
expression
of
her
face
indicated
the
liveliest
sympathy
*NL*
for
me
;
and
moving
towards
the
place
where
I
lay
,
with
one
arm
slightly
*NL*
elevated
in
a
gesture
of
pity
,
and
her
large
glistening
eyes
gazing
*NL*
intently
into
mine
,
she
would
murmur
plaintively
,
`
Awha
!
awha
!
Tommo
,
'
*NL*
and
seat
herself
mournfully
beside
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
manner
convinced
me
that
she
deeply
compassionated
my
situation
,
as
*NL*
being
removed
from
my
country
and
friends
,
and
placed
beyond
the
reach
*NL*
of
all
relief
.
Indeed
,
at
times
I
was
almost
led
to
believe
that
her
*NL*
mind
was
swayed
by
gentle
impulses
hardly
to
be
anticipated
from
one
in
*NL*
her
condition
;
that
she
appeared
to
be
conscious
there
were
ties
rudely
*NL*
severed
,
which
had
once
bound
us
to
our
homes
;
that
there
were
sisters
*NL*
and
brothers
anxiously
looking
forward
to
our
return
,
who
were
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
never
more
to
behold
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
amiable
light
did
Fayaway
appear
in
my
eyes
;
and
reposing
full
*NL*
confidence
in
her
candour
and
intelligence
,
I
now
had
recourse
to
her
,
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
my
alarm
,
with
regard
to
my
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
questions
evidently
distressed
her
.
She
looked
round
from
one
to
*NL*
another
of
the
bystanders
,
as
if
hardly
knowing
what
answer
to
give
me
.
*NL*
At
last
,
yielding
to
my
importunities
,
she
overcame
her
scruples
,
and
*NL*
gave
me
to
understand
that
Toby
had
gone
away
with
the
boats
which
had
*NL*
visited
the
bay
,
but
had
promised
to
return
at
the
expiration
of
three
*NL*
days
.
At
first
I
accused
him
of
perfidiously
deserting
me
;
but
as
I
grew
*NL*
more
composed
,
I
upbraided
myself
for
imputing
so
cowardly
an
action
*NL*
to
him
,
and
tranquillized
myself
with
the
belief
that
he
had
availed
*NL*
himself
,
of
the
opportunity
to
go
round
to
Nukuheva
,
in
order
to
make
*NL*
some
arrangement
by
which
I
could
be
removed
from
the
valley
.
At
any
*NL*
rate
,
thought
I
,
he
will
return
with
the
medicines
I
require
,
and
then
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
I
recover
,
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
the
way
of
our
*NL*
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Consoling
myself
with
these
reflections
,
I
lay
down
that
night
in
a
*NL*
happier
frame
of
mind
than
I
had
done
for
some
time
.
The
next
day
passed
*NL*
without
any
allusion
to
Toby
on
the
part
of
the
natives
,
who
seemed
*NL*
desirous
of
avoiding
all
reference
to
the
subject
.
This
raised
some
*NL*
apprehensions
in
my
breast
;
but
when
night
came
,
I
congratulated
myself
*NL*
that
the
second
day
had
now
gone
by
,
and
that
on
the
morrow
Toby
would
*NL*
again
be
with
me
.
But
the
morrow
came
and
went
,
and
my
companion
did
*NL*
not
appear
.
Ah
!
thought
I
,
he
reckons
three
days
from
the
morning
of
his
*NL*
departure
,
--
tomorrow
he
will
arrive
.
But
that
weary
day
also
closed
upon
*NL*
me
,
without
his
return
.
Even
yet
I
would
not
despair
;
I
thought
that
*NL*
something
detained
him
--
that
he
was
waiting
for
the
sailing
of
a
boat
,
*NL*
at
Nukuheva
,
and
that
in
a
day
or
two
at
farthest
I
should
see
him
*NL*
again
.
But
day
after
day
of
renewed
disappointment
passed
by
;
at
last
*NL*
hope
deserted
me
,
and
I
fell
a
victim
to
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
;
thought
I
,
gloomily
,
he
has
secured
his
own
escape
,
and
cares
not
*NL*
what
calamity
may
befall
his
unfortunate
comrade
.
Fool
that
I
was
,
*NL*
to
suppose
that
any
one
would
willingly
encounter
the
perils
of
this
*NL*
valley
,
after
having
once
got
beyond
its
limits
!
He
has
gone
,
and
has
*NL*
left
me
to
combat
alone
all
the
dangers
by
which
I
am
surrounded
.
Thus
*NL*
would
I
sometimes
seek
to
derive
a
desperate
consolation
from
dwelling
*NL*
upon
the
perfidity
of
Toby
:
whilst
at
other
times
I
sunk
under
the
*NL*
bitter
remorse
which
I
felt
as
having
by
my
own
imprudence
brought
upon
*NL*
myself
the
fate
which
I
was
sure
awaited
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
other
times
I
thought
that
perhaps
after
all
these
treacherous
*NL*
savages
had
made
away
with
him
,
and
thence
the
confusion
into
which
*NL*
they
were
thrown
by
my
questions
,
and
their
contradictory
answers
,
or
he
*NL*
might
be
a
captive
in
some
other
part
of
the
valley
,
or
,
more
dreadful
*NL*
still
,
might
have
met
with
that
fate
at
which
my
very
soul
shuddered
.
*NL*
But
all
these
speculations
were
vain
;
no
tidings
of
Toby
ever
reached
*NL*
me
;
he
had
gone
never
to
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conduct
of
the
islanders
appeared
inexplicable
.
All
reference
to
my
*NL*
lost
comrade
was
carefully
evaded
,
and
if
at
any
time
they
were
forced
*NL*
to
make
some
reply
to
my
frequent
inquiries
on
the
subject
,
they
would
*NL*
uniformly
denounce
him
as
an
ungrateful
runaway
,
who
had
deserted
*NL*
his
friend
,
and
taken
himself
off
to
that
vile
and
detestable
place
*NL*
Nukuheva
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whatever
might
have
been
his
fate
,
now
that
he
was
gone
the
natives
*NL*
multiplied
their
acts
of
kindness
and
attention
towards
myself
,
treating
*NL*
me
with
a
degree
of
deference
which
could
hardly
have
been
surpassed
had
*NL*
I
been
some
celestial
visitant
.
Kory-Kory
never
for
one
moment
left
my
*NL*
side
,
unless
it
were
to
execute
my
wishes
.
The
faithful
fellow
,
twice
*NL*
every
day
,
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
and
in
the
evening
,
insisted
upon
*NL*
carrying
me
to
the
stream
,
and
bathing
me
in
its
refreshing
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frequently
in
the
afternoon
he
would
carry
me
to
a
particular
part
of
*NL*
the
stream
,
where
the
beauty
of
the
scene
produced
a
soothing
influence
*NL*
upon
my
mind
.
At
this
place
the
waters
flowed
between
grassy
banks
,
*NL*
planted
with
enormous
bread-fruit
trees
,
whose
vast
branches
interlacing
*NL*
overhead
,
formed
a
leafy
canopy
;
near
the
stream
were
several
smooth
*NL*
black
rocks
.
One
of
these
,
projecting
several
feet
above
the
surface
*NL*
of
the
water
,
had
upon
its
summit
a
shallow
cavity
,
which
,
filled
with
*NL*
freshly-gathered
leaves
,
formed
a
delightful
couch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
often
lay
for
hours
,
covered
with
a
gauze-like
veil
of
tappa
,
*NL*
while
Fayaway
,
seated
beside
me
,
and
holding
in
her
hand
a
fan
woven
*NL*
from
the
leaflets
of
a
young
cocoanut
bough
,
brushed
aside
the
insects
*NL*
that
occasionally
lighted
on
my
face
,
and
Kory-Kory
,
with
a
view
of
*NL*
chasing
away
my
melancholy
,
performed
a
thousand
antics
in
the
water
*NL*
before
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
my
eye
wandered
along
this
romantic
stream
,
it
would
fall
upon
the
*NL*
half-immersed
figure
of
a
beautiful
girl
,
standing
in
the
transparent
*NL*
water
,
and
catching
in
a
little
net
a
species
of
diminutive
shell-fish
,
*NL*
of
which
these
people
are
extraordinarily
fond
.
Sometimes
a
chattering
*NL*
group
would
be
seated
upon
the
edge
of
a
low
rock
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
brook
,
busily
engaged
in
thinning
and
polishing
the
shells
of
cocoanuts
,
*NL*
by
rubbing
them
briskly
with
a
small
stone
in
the
water
,
an
operation
*NL*
which
soon
converts
them
into
a
light
and
elegant
drinking
vessel
,
*NL*
somewhat
resembling
goblets
made
of
tortoise
shell
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
tranquillizing
influence
of
beautiful
scenery
,
and
the
*NL*
exhibition
of
human
life
under
so
novel
and
charming
an
aspect
were
not
*NL*
my
only
sources
of
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
evening
the
girls
of
the
house
gathered
about
me
on
the
mats
,
and
*NL*
after
chasing
away
Kory-Kory
from
my
side
--
who
nevertheless
,
retired
*NL*
only
to
a
little
distance
and
watched
their
proceedings
with
the
most
*NL*
jealous
attention
--
would
anoint
my
whole
body
with
a
fragrant
oil
,
*NL*
squeezed
from
a
yellow
root
,
previously
pounded
between
a
couple
of
*NL*
stones
,
and
which
in
their
language
is
denominated
`
aka
'
.
And
most
*NL*
refreshing
and
agreeable
are
the
juices
of
the
`
aka
'
,
when
applied
to
*NL*
ones
,
limbs
by
the
soft
palms
of
sweet
nymphs
,
whose
bright
eyes
are
*NL*
beaming
upon
you
with
kindness
;
and
I
used
to
hail
with
delight
the
*NL*
daily
recurrence
of
this
luxurious
operation
,
in
which
I
forgot
all
my
*NL*
troubles
,
and
buried
for
the
time
every
feeling
of
sorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
my
devoted
servitor
would
lead
me
*NL*
out
upon
the
pi-pi
in
front
of
the
house
,
and
seating
me
near
its
edge
,
*NL*
protect
my
body
from
the
annoyance
of
the
insects
which
occasionally
*NL*
hovered
in
the
air
,
by
wrapping
me
round
with
a
large
roll
of
tappa
.
*NL*
He
then
bustled
about
,
and
employed
himself
at
least
twenty
minutes
in
*NL*
adjusting
everything
to
secure
my
personal
comfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
perfected
his
arrangements
,
he
would
get
my
pipe
,
and
,
lighting
*NL*
it
,
would
hand
it
to
me
.
Often
he
was
obliged
to
strike
a
light
for
the
*NL*
occasion
,
and
as
the
mode
he
adopted
was
entirely
different
from
what
I
*NL*
had
ever
seen
or
heard
of
before
I
will
describe
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
straight
,
dry
,
and
partly
decayed
stick
of
the
Hibiscus
,
about
six
*NL*
feet
in
length
,
and
half
as
many
inches
in
diameter
,
with
a
small
,
bit
*NL*
of
wood
not
more
than
a
foot
long
,
and
scarcely
an
inch
wide
,
is
as
*NL*
invariably
to
be
met
with
in
every
house
in
Typee
as
a
box
of
lucifer
*NL*
matches
in
the
corner
of
a
kitchen
cupboard
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
islander
,
placing
the
larger
stick
obliquely
against
some
object
,
*NL*
with
one
end
elevated
at
an
angle
of
forty-five
degrees
,
mounts
astride
*NL*
of
it
like
an
urchin
about
to
gallop
off
upon
a
cane
,
and
then
grasping
*NL*
the
smaller
one
firmly
in
both
hands
,
he
rubs
its
pointed
end
slowly
*NL*
up
and
down
the
extent
of
a
few
inches
on
the
principal
stick
,
until
at
*NL*
last
he
makes
a
narrow
groove
in
the
wood
,
with
an
abrupt
termination
*NL*
at
the
point
furthest
from
him
,
where
all
the
dusty
particles
which
the
*NL*
friction
creates
are
accumulated
in
a
little
heap
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Kory-Kory
goes
to
work
quite
leisurely
,
but
gradually
quickens
*NL*
his
pace
,
and
waxing
warm
in
the
employment
,
drives
the
stick
furiously
*NL*
along
the
smoking
channel
,
plying
his
hands
to
and
fro
with
amazing
*NL*
rapidity
,
the
perspiration
starting
from
every
pore
.
As
he
approaches
*NL*
the
climax
of
his
effort
,
he
pants
and
gasps
for
breath
,
and
his
eyes
*NL*
almost
start
from
their
sockets
with
the
violence
of
his
exertions
.
This
*NL*
is
the
critical
stage
of
the
operation
;
all
his
previous
labours
*NL*
are
vain
if
he
can
not
sustain
the
rapidity
of
the
movement
until
the
*NL*
reluctant
spark
is
produced
.
Suddenly
he
stops
,
becoming
perfectly
*NL*
motionless
.
His
hands
still
retain
their
hold
of
the
smaller
stick
,
*NL*
which
is
pressed
convulsively
against
the
further
end
of
the
channel
*NL*
among
the
fine
powder
there
accumulated
,
as
if
he
had
just
pierced
*NL*
through
and
through
some
little
viper
that
was
wriggling
and
struggling
*NL*
to
escape
from
his
clutches
.
The
next
moment
a
delicate
wreath
of
smoke
*NL*
curls
spirally
into
the
air
,
the
heap
of
dusty
particles
glows
with
*NL*
fire
,
and
Kory-Kory
,
almost
breathless
,
dismounts
from
his
steed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
operation
appeared
to
me
to
be
the
most
laborious
species
of
work
*NL*
performed
in
Typee
;
and
had
I
possessed
a
sufficient
intimacy
with
the
*NL*
language
to
have
conveyed
my
ideas
upon
the
subject
,
I
should
certainly
*NL*
have
suggested
to
the
most
influential
of
the
natives
the
expediency
of
*NL*
establishing
a
college
of
vestals
to
be
centrally
located
in
the
valley
,
*NL*
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
alive
the
indispensable
article
of
fire
;
so
*NL*
as
to
supersede
the
necessity
of
such
a
vast
outlay
of
strength
and
*NL*
good
temper
,
as
were
usually
squandered
on
these
occasions
.
There
might
,
*NL*
however
,
be
special
difficulties
in
carrying
this
plan
into
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
striking
evidence
does
this
operation
furnish
of
the
wide
*NL*
difference
between
the
extreme
of
savage
and
civilized
life
.
A
gentleman
*NL*
of
Typee
can
bring
up
a
numerous
family
of
children
and
give
them
all
*NL*
a
highly
respectable
cannibal
education
,
with
infinitely
less
toil
*NL*
and
anxiety
than
he
expends
in
the
simple
process
of
striking
a
light
;
*NL*
whilst
a
poor
European
artisan
,
who
through
the
instrumentality
of
a
*NL*
lucifer
performs
the
same
operation
in
one
second
,
is
put
to
his
wit
's
*NL*
end
to
provide
for
his
starving
offspring
that
food
which
the
children
*NL*
of
a
Polynesian
father
,
without
troubling
their
parents
,
pluck
from
the
*NL*
branches
of
every
tree
around
them
.

KINDNESS
OF
MARHEYO
AND
THE
REST
OF
THE
ISLANDERS
--
A
FULL
DESCRIPTION
OF
*NL*
THE
BREAD-FRUIT
TREE
--
DIFFERENT
MODES
OF
PREPARING
THE
FRUIT
*NL*
*NL*
ALL
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
treated
me
with
great
kindness
;
but
as
*NL*
to
the
household
of
Marheyo
,
with
whom
I
was
now
permanently
domiciled
,
*NL*
nothing
could
surpass
their
efforts
to
minister
to
my
comfort
.
To
the
*NL*
gratification
of
my
palate
they
paid
the
most
unwearied
attention
.
*NL*
They
continually
invited
me
to
partake
of
food
,
and
when
after
eating
*NL*
heartily
I
declined
the
viands
they
continued
to
offer
me
,
they
seemed
*NL*
to
think
that
my
appetite
stood
in
need
of
some
piquant
stimulant
to
*NL*
excite
its
activity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
pursuance
of
this
idea
,
old
Marheyo
himself
would
hie
him
away
to
*NL*
the
sea-shore
by
the
break
of
day
,
for
the
purpose
of
collecting
*NL*
various
species
of
rare
sea-weed
;
some
of
which
among
these
people
are
*NL*
considered
a
great
luxury
.
After
a
whole
day
spent
in
this
employment
,
*NL*
he
would
return
about
nightfall
with
several
cocoanut
shells
filled
with
*NL*
different
descriptions
of
kelp
.
In
preparing
these
for
use
he
manifested
*NL*
all
the
ostentation
of
a
professed
cook
,
although
the
chief
mystery
of
*NL*
the
affair
appeared
to
consist
in
pouring
water
in
judicious
quantities
*NL*
upon
the
slimy
contents
of
his
cocoanut
shells
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
time
he
submitted
one
of
these
saline
salads
to
my
critical
*NL*
attention
I
naturally
thought
that
anything
collected
at
such
pains
must
*NL*
possess
peculiar
merits
;
but
one
mouthful
was
a
complete
dose
;
and
great
*NL*
was
the
consternation
of
the
old
warrior
at
the
rapidity
with
which
I
*NL*
ejected
his
Epicurean
treat
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
true
it
is
,
that
the
rarity
of
any
particular
article
enhances
*NL*
its
value
amazingly
.
In
some
part
of
the
valley
--
I
know
not
where
,
but
*NL*
probably
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
sea
--
the
girls
were
sometimes
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
procuring
small
quantities
of
salt
,
a
thimble-full
or
*NL*
so
being
the
result
of
the
united
labours
of
a
party
of
five
or
six
*NL*
employed
for
the
greater
part
of
the
day
.
This
precious
commodity
they
*NL*
brought
to
the
house
,
enveloped
in
multitudinous
folds
of
leaves
;
and
*NL*
as
a
special
mark
of
the
esteem
in
which
they
held
me
,
would
spread
*NL*
an
immense
leaf
on
the
ground
,
and
dropping
one
by
one
a
few
minute
*NL*
particles
of
the
salt
upon
it
,
invite
me
to
taste
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
extravagant
value
placed
upon
the
article
,
I
verily
believe
,
*NL*
that
with
a
bushel
of
common
Liverpool
salt
all
the
real
estate
in
Typee
*NL*
might
have
been
purchased
.
With
a
small
pinch
of
it
in
one
hand
,
and
a
*NL*
quarter
section
of
a
bread-fruit
in
the
other
,
the
greatest
chief
in
the
*NL*
valley
would
have
laughed
at
all
luxuries
of
a
Parisian
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
celebrity
of
the
bread-fruit
tree
,
and
the
conspicuous
place
it
*NL*
occupies
in
a
Typee
bill
of
fare
,
induces
me
to
give
at
some
length
*NL*
a
general
description
of
the
tree
,
and
the
various
modes
in
which
the
*NL*
fruit
is
prepared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bread-fruit
tree
,
in
its
glorious
prime
,
is
a
grand
and
towering
*NL*
object
,
forming
the
same
feature
in
a
Marquesan
landscape
that
the
*NL*
patriarchal
elm
does
in
New
England
scenery
.
The
latter
tree
it
not
a
*NL*
little
resembles
in
height
,
in
the
wide
spread
of
its
stalwart
branches
,
*NL*
and
in
its
venerable
and
imposing
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
leaves
of
the
bread-fruit
are
of
great
size
,
and
their
edges
are
cut
*NL*
and
scolloped
as
fantastically
as
those
of
a
lady
's
lace
collar
.
As
they
*NL*
annually
tend
towards
decay
,
they
almost
rival
in
brilliant
variety
*NL*
of
their
gradually
changing
hues
the
fleeting
shades
of
the
expiring
*NL*
dolphin
.
The
autumnal
tints
of
our
American
forests
,
glorious
as
they
*NL*
are
,
sink
into
nothing
in
comparison
with
this
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
leaf
,
in
one
particular
stage
,
when
nearly
all
the
prismatic
colours
*NL*
are
blended
on
its
surface
,
is
often
converted
by
the
natives
into
*NL*
a
superb
and
striking
head-dress
.
The
principal
fibre
traversing
its
*NL*
length
being
split
open
a
convenient
distance
,
and
the
elastic
sides
of
*NL*
the
aperture
pressed
apart
,
the
head
is
inserted
between
them
,
the
leaf
*NL*
drooping
on
one
side
,
with
its
forward
half
turned
jauntily
up
on
the
*NL*
brows
,
and
the
remaining
part
spreading
laterally
behind
the
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fruit
somewhat
resembles
in
magnitude
and
general
appearance
one
of
*NL*
our
citron
melons
of
ordinary
size
;
but
,
unlike
the
citron
,
it
has
no
*NL*
sectional
lines
drawn
along
the
outside
.
Its
surface
is
dotted
all
over
*NL*
with
little
conical
prominences
,
looking
not
unlike
the
knobs
,
on
an
*NL*
antiquated
church
door
.
The
rind
is
perhaps
an
eighth
of
an
inch
in
*NL*
thickness
;
and
denuded
of
this
at
the
time
when
it
is
in
the
greatest
*NL*
perfection
,
the
fruit
presents
a
beautiful
globe
of
white
pulp
,
the
*NL*
whole
of
which
may
be
eaten
,
with
the
exception
of
a
slender
core
,
which
*NL*
is
easily
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bread-fruit
,
however
,
is
never
used
,
and
is
indeed
altogether
unfit
*NL*
to
be
eaten
,
until
submitted
in
one
form
or
other
to
the
action
of
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
simple
manner
in
which
this
operation
is
performed
,
and
I
*NL*
think
,
the
best
,
consists
in
placing
any
number
of
the
freshly
plucked
*NL*
fruit
,
when
in
a
particular
state
of
greenness
,
among
the
embers
of
a
*NL*
fire
,
in
the
same
way
that
you
would
roast
a
potato
.
After
the
lapse
*NL*
of
ten
or
fifteen
minutes
,
the
green
rind
embrowns
and
cracks
,
showing
*NL*
through
the
fissures
in
its
sides
the
milk-white
interior
.
As
soon
as
it
*NL*
cools
the
rind
drops
off
,
and
you
then
have
the
soft
round
pulp
in
its
*NL*
purest
and
most
delicious
state
.
Thus
eaten
,
it
has
a
mild
and
pleasing
*NL*
flavour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
after
having
been
roasted
in
the
fire
,
the
natives
snatch
it
*NL*
briskly
from
the
embers
,
and
permitting
it
to
slip
out
of
the
yielding
*NL*
rind
into
a
vessel
of
cold
water
,
stir
up
the
mixture
,
which
they
*NL*
call
`
bo-a-sho
'
.
I
never
could
endure
this
compound
,
and
indeed
the
*NL*
preparation
is
not
greatly
in
vogue
among
the
more
polite
Typees
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
one
form
,
however
,
in
which
the
fruit
is
occasionally
served
,
*NL*
that
renders
it
a
dish
fit
for
a
king
.
As
soon
as
it
is
taken
from
the
*NL*
fire
the
exterior
is
removed
,
the
core
extracted
,
and
the
remaining
part
*NL*
is
placed
in
a
sort
of
shallow
stone
mortar
,
and
briskly
worked
with
*NL*
a
pestle
of
the
same
substance
.
While
one
person
is
performing
this
*NL*
operation
,
another
takes
a
ripe
cocoanut
,
and
breaking
it
in
halves
,
*NL*
which
they
also
do
very
cleverly
,
proceeds
to
grate
the
juicy
meat
into
*NL*
fine
particles
.
This
is
done
by
means
of
a
piece
of
mother-of-pearl
*NL*
shell
,
lashed
firmly
to
the
extreme
end
of
a
heavy
stick
,
with
its
*NL*
straight
side
accurately
notched
like
a
saw
.
The
stick
is
sometimes
a
*NL*
grotesquely-formed
limb
of
a
tree
,
with
three
or
four
branches
twisting
*NL*
from
its
body
like
so
many
shapeless
legs
,
and
sustaining
it
two
or
*NL*
three
feet
from
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
native
,
first
placing
a
calabash
beneath
the
nose
,
as
it
were
,
of
*NL*
his
curious-looking
log-steed
,
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
the
*NL*
grated
fragments
as
they
fall
,
mounts
astride
of
it
as
if
it
were
a
*NL*
hobby-horse
,
and
twirling
the
inside
of
his
hemispheres
of
cocoanut
*NL*
around
the
sharp
teeth
of
the
mother-of-pearl
shell
,
the
pure
white
meat
*NL*
falls
in
snowy
showers
into
the
receptacle
provided
.
Having
obtained
a
*NL*
quantity
sufficient
for
his
purpose
,
he
places
it
in
a
bag
made
of
*NL*
the
net-like
fibrous
substance
attached
to
all
cocoanut
trees
,
and
*NL*
compressing
it
over
the
bread-fruit
,
which
being
now
sufficiently
*NL*
pounded
,
is
put
into
a
wooden
bowl
--
extracts
a
thick
creamy
milk
.
The
*NL*
delicious
liquid
soon
bubbles
round
the
fruit
,
and
leaves
it
at
last
*NL*
just
peeping
above
its
surface
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
preparation
is
called
`
kokoo
'
,
and
a
most
luscious
preparation
it
*NL*
is
.
The
hobby-horse
and
the
pestle
and
mortar
were
in
great
requisition
*NL*
during
the
time
I
remained
in
the
house
of
Marheyo
,
and
Kory-Kory
had
*NL*
frequent
occasion
to
show
his
skill
in
their
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
great
staple
articles
of
food
into
which
the
bread-fruit
is
*NL*
converted
by
these
natives
are
known
respectively
by
the
names
of
Amar
*NL*
and
Poee-Poee
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
certain
season
of
the
year
,
when
the
fruit
of
the
hundred
groves
*NL*
of
the
valley
has
reached
its
maturity
,
and
hangs
in
golden
spheres
from
*NL*
every
branch
,
the
islanders
assemble
in
harvest
groups
,
and
garner
in
*NL*
the
abundance
which
surrounds
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trees
are
stripped
of
their
nodding
burdens
,
which
,
easily
freed
*NL*
from
the
rind
and
core
,
are
gathered
together
in
capacious
wooden
*NL*
vessels
,
where
the
pulpy
fruit
is
soon
worked
by
a
stone
pestle
,
*NL*
vigorously
applied
,
into
a
blended
mass
of
a
doughy
consistency
,
called
*NL*
by
the
natives
`
Tutao
'
.
This
is
then
divided
into
separate
parcels
,
*NL*
which
,
after
being
made
up
into
stout
packages
,
enveloped
in
successive
*NL*
folds
of
leaves
,
and
bound
round
with
thongs
of
bark
,
are
stored
away
in
*NL*
large
receptacles
hollowed
in
the
earth
,
from
whence
they
are
drawn
as
*NL*
occasion
may
require
.
In
this
condition
the
Tutao
sometimes
remains
for
*NL*
years
,
and
even
is
thought
to
improve
by
age
.
Before
it
is
fit
to
be
*NL*
eaten
,
however
,
it
has
to
undergo
an
additional
process
.
A
primitive
*NL*
oven
is
scooped
in
the
ground
,
and
its
bottom
being
loosely
covered
*NL*
with
stones
,
a
large
fire
is
kindled
within
it
.
As
soon
as
the
requisite
*NL*
degree
of
heat
is
attained
,
the
embers
are
removed
,
and
the
surface
of
*NL*
the
stones
being
covered
with
thick
layers
of
leaves
,
one
of
the
large
*NL*
packages
of
Tutao
is
deposited
upon
them
and
overspread
with
another
*NL*
layer
of
leaves
.
The
whole
is
then
quickly
heaped
up
with
earth
,
and
*NL*
forms
a
sloping
mound
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Tutao
thus
baked
is
called
`
Amar
'
;
the
action
of
the
oven
having
*NL*
converted
it
into
an
amber-coloured
caky
substance
,
a
little
tart
,
but
*NL*
not
at
all
disagreeable
to
the
taste
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
another
and
final
process
the
`
Amar
'
is
changed
into
`
Poee-Poee
'
.
*NL*
This
transition
is
rapidly
effected
.
The
Amar
is
placed
in
a
vessel
,
and
*NL*
mixed
with
water
until
it
gains
a
proper
pudding-like
consistency
,
when
,
*NL*
without
further
preparation
,
it
is
in
readiness
for
use
.
This
is
the
*NL*
form
in
which
the
`
Tutao
'
is
generally
consumed
.
The
singular
mode
of
*NL*
eating
it
I
have
already
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
Were
it
not
that
the
bread-fruit
is
thus
capable
of
being
preserved
for
*NL*
a
length
of
time
,
the
natives
might
be
reduced
to
a
state
of
starvation
;
*NL*
for
owing
to
some
unknown
cause
the
trees
sometimes
fail
to
bear
fruit
;
*NL*
and
on
such
occasions
the
islanders
chiefly
depend
upon
the
supplies
*NL*
they
have
been
enabled
to
store
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
stately
tree
,
which
is
rarely
met
with
upon
the
Sandwich
Islands
,
*NL*
and
then
only
of
a
very
inferior
quality
,
and
at
Tahiti
does
not
abound
*NL*
to
a
degree
that
renders
its
fruit
the
principal
article
of
food
,
*NL*
attains
its
greatest
excellence
in
the
genial
climate
of
the
Marquesan
*NL*
group
,
where
it
grows
to
an
enormous
magnitude
,
and
flourishes
in
the
*NL*
utmost
abundance
.

CHAPTER
SIXTEEN
*NL*
*NL*
MELANCHOLY
CONDITION
--
OCCURRENCE
AT
THE
TI
--
ANECDOTE
OF
MARHEYO
--
SHAVING
*NL*
THE
HEAD
OF
A
WARRIOR
*NL*
*NL*
IN
looking
back
to
this
period
,
and
calling
to
remembrance
the
*NL*
numberless
proofs
of
kindness
and
respect
which
I
received
from
the
*NL*
natives
of
the
valley
,
I
can
scarcely
understand
how
it
was
that
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
so
many
consolatory
circumstances
,
my
mind
should
still
have
*NL*
been
consumed
by
the
most
dismal
forebodings
,
and
have
remained
a
*NL*
prey
to
the
profoundest
melancholy
.
It
is
true
that
the
suspicious
*NL*
circumstances
which
had
attended
the
disappearance
of
Toby
were
enough
*NL*
of
themselves
to
excite
distrust
with
regard
to
the
savages
,
in
whose
*NL*
power
I
felt
myself
to
be
entirely
placed
,
especially
when
it
was
*NL*
combined
with
the
knowledge
that
these
very
men
,
kind
and
respectful
*NL*
as
they
were
to
me
,
were
,
after
all
,
nothing
better
than
a
set
of
*NL*
cannibals
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
my
chief
source
of
anxiety
,
and
that
which
poisoned
every
temporary
*NL*
enjoyment
,
was
the
mysterious
disease
in
my
leg
,
which
still
remained
*NL*
unabated
.
All
the
herbal
applications
of
Tinor
,
united
with
the
severer
*NL*
discipline
of
the
old
leech
,
and
the
affectionate
nursing
of
Kory-Kory
,
*NL*
had
failed
to
relieve
me
.
I
was
almost
a
cripple
,
and
the
pain
I
endured
*NL*
at
intervals
was
agonizing
.
The
unaccountable
malady
showed
no
signs
*NL*
of
amendment
:
on
the
contrary
,
its
violence
increased
day
by
day
,
and
*NL*
threatened
the
most
fatal
results
,
unless
some
powerful
means
were
*NL*
employed
to
counteract
it
.
It
seemed
as
if
I
were
destined
to
sink
*NL*
under
this
grievous
affliction
,
or
at
least
that
it
would
hinder
me
from
*NL*
availing
myself
of
any
opportunity
of
escaping
from
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
incident
which
occurred
as
nearly
as
I
can
estimate
about
three
weeks
*NL*
after
the
disappearance
of
Toby
,
convinced
me
that
the
natives
,
from
*NL*
some
reason
or
other
,
would
interpose
every
possible
obstacle
to
my
*NL*
leaving
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
there
was
no
little
excitement
evinced
by
the
people
near
*NL*
my
abode
,
and
which
I
soon
discovered
proceeded
from
a
vague
report
*NL*
that
boats
,
had
been
seen
at
a
great
distance
approaching
the
bay
.
*NL*
Immediately
all
was
bustle
and
animation
.
It
so
happened
that
day
that
*NL*
the
pain
I
suffered
having
somewhat
abated
,
and
feeling
in
much
better
*NL*
spirits
than
usual
,
I
had
complied
with
Kory-Kory
's
invitation
to
visit
*NL*
the
chief
Mehevi
at
the
place
called
the
`
Ti
'
,
which
I
have
before
*NL*
described
as
being
situated
within
the
precincts
of
the
Taboo
Groves
.
*NL*
These
sacred
recesses
were
at
no
great
distance
from
Marheyo
's
*NL*
habitation
,
and
lay
between
it
and
the
sea
;
the
path
that
conducted
to
*NL*
the
beach
passing
directly
in
front
of
the
Ti
,
and
thence
skirting
along
*NL*
the
border
of
the
groves
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
reposing
upon
the
mats
,
within
the
sacred
building
,
in
company
*NL*
with
Mehevi
and
several
other
chiefs
,
when
the
announcement
was
first
*NL*
made
.
It
sent
a
thrill
of
joy
through
my
whole
frame
;
--
perhaps
Toby
was
*NL*
about
to
return
.
I
rose
at
once
to
my
feet
,
and
my
instinctive
impulse
*NL*
was
to
hurry
down
to
the
beach
,
equally
regardless
of
the
distance
that
*NL*
separated
me
from
it
,
and
of
my
disabled
condition
.
As
soon
as
Mehevi
*NL*
noticed
the
effect
the
intelligence
had
produced
upon
me
,
and
the
*NL*
impatience
I
betrayed
to
reach
the
sea
,
his
countenance
assumed
that
*NL*
inflexible
rigidity
of
expression
which
had
so
awed
me
on
the
afternoon
*NL*
of
our
arrival
at
the
house
of
Marheyo
.
As
I
was
proceeding
to
leave
*NL*
the
Ti
,
he
laid
his
hand
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
said
gravely
,
`
abo
,
abo
'
*NL*
-LRB-
wait
,
wait
-RRB-
.
Solely
intent
upon
the
one
thought
that
occupied
my
mind
,
*NL*
and
heedless
of
his
request
,
I
was
brushing
past
him
,
when
suddenly
he
*NL*
assumed
a
tone
of
authority
,
and
told
me
to
`
moee
'
-LRB-
sit
down
-RRB-
.
Though
*NL*
struck
by
the
alteration
in
his
demeanour
,
the
excitement
under
which
I
*NL*
laboured
was
too
strong
to
permit
me
to
obey
the
unexpected
command
,
*NL*
and
I
was
still
limping
towards
the
edge
of
the
pi-pi
with
Kory-Kory
*NL*
clinging
to
one
arm
in
his
efforts
to
restrain
me
,
when
the
natives
*NL*
around
started
to
their
feet
,
ranged
themselves
along
the
open
front
of
*NL*
the
building
,
while
Mehevi
looked
at
me
scowlingly
,
and
reiterated
his
*NL*
commands
still
more
sternly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
moment
,
when
fifty
savage
countenances
were
glaring
upon
*NL*
me
,
that
I
first
truly
experienced
I
was
indeed
a
captive
in
the
*NL*
valley
.
The
conviction
rushed
upon
me
with
staggering
force
,
and
I
was
*NL*
overwhelmed
by
this
confirmation
of
my
worst
fears
.
I
saw
at
once
that
*NL*
it
was
useless
for
me
to
resist
,
and
sick
at
heart
,
I
reseated
myself
*NL*
upon
the
mats
,
and
for
the
moment
abandoned
myself
to
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
perceived
the
natives
one
after
the
other
hurrying
past
the
Ti
and
*NL*
pursuing
the
route
that
conducted
to
the
sea
.
These
savages
,
thought
*NL*
I
,
will
soon
be
holding
communication
with
some
of
my
own
countrymen
*NL*
perhaps
,
who
with
ease
could
restore
me
to
liberty
did
they
know
of
the
*NL*
situation
I
was
in
.
No
language
can
describe
the
wretchedness
which
I
*NL*
felt
;
and
in
the
bitterness
of
my
soul
I
imprecated
a
thousand
curses
on
*NL*
the
perfidious
Toby
,
who
had
thus
abandoned
me
to
destruction
.
It
was
in
*NL*
vain
that
Kory-Kory
tempted
me
with
food
,
or
lighted
my
pipe
,
or
sought
*NL*
to
attract
my
attention
by
performing
the
uncouth
antics
that
*NL*
had
sometimes
diverted
me
.
I
was
fairly
knocked
down
by
this
last
*NL*
misfortune
,
which
,
much
as
I
had
feared
it
,
I
had
never
before
had
the
*NL*
courage
calmly
to
contemplate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Regardless
of
everything
but
my
own
sorrow
,
I
remained
in
the
Ti
for
*NL*
several
hours
,
until
shouts
proceeding
at
intervals
from
the
groves
*NL*
beyond
the
house
proclaimed
the
return
of
the
natives
from
the
beach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
any
boats
visited
the
bay
that
morning
or
not
,
I
never
could
*NL*
ascertain
.
The
savages
assured
me
that
there
had
not
--
but
I
was
inclined
*NL*
to
believe
that
by
deceiving
me
in
this
particular
they
sought
to
allay
*NL*
the
violence
of
my
grief
.
However
that
might
be
,
this
incident
showed
*NL*
plainly
that
the
Typees
intended
to
hold
me
a
prisoner
.
As
they
still
*NL*
treated
me
with
the
same
sedulous
attention
as
before
,
I
was
utterly
*NL*
at
a
loss
how
to
account
for
their
singular
conduct
.
Had
I
been
in
a
*NL*
situation
to
instruct
them
in
any
of
the
rudiments
of
the
mechanic
arts
,
*NL*
or
had
I
manifested
a
disposition
to
render
myself
in
any
way
useful
*NL*
among
them
,
their
conduct
might
have
been
attributed
to
some
adequate
*NL*
motive
,
but
as
it
was
,
the
matter
seemed
to
me
inexplicable
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
my
whole
stay
on
the
island
there
occurred
but
two
or
three
*NL*
instances
where
the
natives
applied
to
me
with
the
view
of
availing
*NL*
themselves
of
my
superior
information
;
and
these
now
appear
so
ludicrous
*NL*
that
I
can
not
forbear
relating
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
few
things
we
had
brought
from
Nukuheva
had
been
done
up
into
a
*NL*
small
bundle
which
we
had
carried
with
us
in
our
descent
to
the
valley
.
*NL*
This
bundle
,
the
first
night
of
our
arrival
,
I
had
used
as
a
pillow
,
but
*NL*
on
the
succeeding
morning
,
opening
it
for
the
inspection
of
the
natives
,
*NL*
they
gazed
upon
the
miscellaneous
contents
as
though
I
had
just
revealed
*NL*
to
them
a
casket
of
diamonds
,
and
they
insisted
that
so
precious
a
*NL*
treasure
should
be
properly
secured
.
A
line
was
accordingly
attached
to
*NL*
it
,
and
the
other
end
being
passed
over
the
ridge-pole
of
the
house
,
it
*NL*
was
hoisted
up
to
the
apex
of
the
roof
,
where
it
hung
suspended
directly
*NL*
over
the
mats
where
I
usually
reclined
.
When
I
desired
anything
from
it
*NL*
I
merely
raised
my
finger
to
a
bamboo
beside
me
,
and
taking
hold
of
*NL*
the
string
which
was
there
fastened
,
lowered
the
package
.
This
was
*NL*
exceedingly
handy
,
and
I
took
care
to
let
the
natives
understand
how
*NL*
much
I
applauded
the
invention
.
Of
this
package
the
chief
contents
were
*NL*
a
razor
with
its
case
,
a
supply
of
needles
and
thread
,
a
pound
or
two
of
*NL*
tobacco
and
a
few
yards
of
bright-coloured
calico
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
have
mentioned
that
shortly
after
Toby
's
disappearance
,
*NL*
perceiving
the
uncertainty
of
the
time
I
might
be
obliged
to
remain
in
*NL*
the
valley
--
if
,
indeed
,
I
ever
should
escape
from
it
--
and
considering
*NL*
that
my
whole
wardrobe
consisted
of
a
shirt
and
a
pair
of
trousers
,
I
*NL*
resolved
to
doff
these
garments
at
once
,
in
order
to
preserve
them
in
*NL*
a
suitable
condition
for
wear
should
I
again
appear
among
civilized
*NL*
beings
.
I
was
consequently
obliged
to
assume
the
Typee
costume
,
a
little
*NL*
altered
,
however
,
to
suit
my
own
views
of
propriety
,
and
in
which
I
have
*NL*
no
doubt
I
appeared
to
as
much
advantage
as
a
senator
of
Rome
enveloped
*NL*
in
the
folds
of
his
toga
.
A
few
folds
of
yellow
tappa
tucked
about
my
*NL*
waist
,
descended
to
my
feet
in
the
style
of
a
lady
's
petticoat
,
only
*NL*
I
did
not
have
recourse
to
those
voluminous
paddings
in
the
rear
with
*NL*
which
our
gentle
dames
are
in
the
habit
of
augmenting
the
sublime
*NL*
rotundity
of
their
figures
.
This
usually
comprised
my
in-door
dress
;
*NL*
whenever
I
walked
out
,
I
superadded
to
it
an
ample
robe
of
the
same
*NL*
material
,
which
completely
enveloped
my
person
,
and
screened
it
from
the
*NL*
rays
of
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
I
made
a
rent
in
this
mantle
;
and
to
show
the
islanders
with
*NL*
what
facility
it
could
be
repaired
,
I
lowered
my
bundle
,
and
taking
*NL*
from
it
a
needle
and
thread
,
proceeded
to
stitch
up
the
opening
.
They
*NL*
regarded
this
wonderful
application
of
science
with
intense
admiration
;
*NL*
and
whilst
I
was
stitching
away
,
old
Marheyo
,
who
was
one
of
the
*NL*
lookers-on
,
suddenly
clapped
his
hand
to
his
forehead
,
and
rushing
to
*NL*
a
corner
of
the
house
,
drew
forth
a
soiled
and
tattered
strip
of
faded
*NL*
calico
which
he
must
have
procured
some
time
or
other
in
traffic
on
the
*NL*
beach
--
and
besought
me
eagerly
to
exercise
a
little
of
my
art
upon
it
.
*NL*
I
willingly
complied
,
though
certainly
so
stumpy
a
needle
as
mine
never
*NL*
took
such
gigantic
strides
over
calico
before
.
The
repairs
completed
,
*NL*
old
Marheyo
gave
me
a
paternal
hug
;
and
divesting
himself
of
his
`
maro
'
*NL*
-LRB-
girdle
-RRB-
,
swathed
the
calico
about
his
loins
,
and
slipping
the
beloved
*NL*
ornaments
into
his
ears
,
grasped
his
spear
and
sallied
out
of
the
house
,
*NL*
like
a
valiant
Templar
arrayed
in
a
new
and
costly
suit
of
armour
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
used
my
razor
during
my
stay
in
the
island
,
but
although
a
*NL*
very
subordinate
affair
,
it
had
been
vastly
admired
by
the
Typees
;
and
*NL*
Narmonee
,
a
great
hero
among
them
,
who
was
exceedingly
precise
in
the
*NL*
arrangements
of
his
toilet
and
the
general
adjustment
of
is
person
,
*NL*
being
the
most
accurately
tattooed
and
laboriously
horrified
individual
*NL*
in
all
the
valley
,
thought
it
would
be
a
great
advantage
to
have
it
*NL*
applied
to
the
already
shaven
crown
of
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
implement
they
usually
employ
is
a
shark
's
tooth
,
which
is
about
as
*NL*
well
adapted
to
the
purpose
as
a
one-pronged
fork
for
pitching
hay
.
No
*NL*
wonder
,
then
,
that
the
acute
Narmonee
perceived
the
advantage
my
razor
*NL*
possessed
over
the
usual
implement
.
Accordingly
,
one
day
he
requested
as
*NL*
a
personal
favour
that
I
would
just
run
over
his
head
with
the
razor
.
In
*NL*
reply
,
I
gave
him
to
understand
that
it
was
too
dull
,
and
could
not
be
*NL*
used
to
any
purpose
without
being
previously
sharpened
.
To
assist
my
*NL*
meaning
,
I
went
through
an
imaginary
honing
process
on
the
palm
of
my
*NL*
hand
.
Narmonee
took
my
meaning
in
an
instant
,
and
running
out
of
the
*NL*
house
,
returned
the
next
moment
with
a
huge
rough
mass
of
rock
as
big
*NL*
as
a
millstone
,
and
indicated
to
me
that
that
was
exactly
the
thing
*NL*
I
wanted
.
Of
course
there
was
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
proceed
to
*NL*
business
,
and
I
began
scraping
away
at
a
great
rate
.
He
writhed
and
*NL*
wriggled
under
the
infliction
,
but
,
fully
convinced
of
my
skill
,
endured
*NL*
the
pain
like
a
martyr
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
I
never
saw
Narmonee
in
battle
I
will
,
from
what
I
then
observed
,
*NL*
stake
my
life
upon
his
courage
and
fortitude
.
Before
commencing
*NL*
operations
,
his
head
had
presented
a
surface
of
short
bristling
hairs
,
*NL*
and
by
the
time
I
had
concluded
my
unskilful
operation
it
resembled
not
*NL*
a
little
a
stubble
field
after
being
gone
over
with
a
harrow
.
However
,
*NL*
as
the
chief
expressed
the
liveliest
satisfaction
at
the
result
,
I
was
*NL*
too
wise
to
dissent
from
his
opinion
.

AND

TYPEES

ENJOYMENTS

PEOPLE
--
A
SKIRMISH
IN
THE
MOUNTAIN
WITH
THE
WARRIORS
OF
HAPPAR
*NL*
*NL*
DAY
after
day
wore
on
,
and
still
there
was
no
perceptible
change
in
the
*NL*
conduct
of
the
islanders
towards
me
.
Gradually
I
lost
all
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
regular
recurrence
of
the
days
of
the
week
,
and
sunk
insensibly
into
*NL*
that
kind
of
apathy
which
ensues
after
some
violent
outburst
of
despair
.
*NL*
My
limb
suddenly
healed
,
the
swelling
went
down
,
the
pain
subsided
,
and
*NL*
I
had
every
reason
to
suppose
I
should
soon
completely
recover
from
the
*NL*
affliction
that
had
so
long
tormented
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
I
was
enabled
to
ramble
about
the
valley
in
company
with
the
*NL*
natives
,
troops
of
whom
followed
me
whenever
I
sallied
out
of
the
house
,
*NL*
I
began
to
experience
an
elasticity
of
mind
which
placed
me
beyond
the
*NL*
reach
of
those
dismal
forebodings
to
which
I
had
so
lately
been
a
prey
.
*NL*
Received
wherever
I
went
with
the
most
deferential
kindness
;
regaled
*NL*
perpetually
with
the
most
delightful
fruits
;
ministered
to
by
dark-eyed
*NL*
nymphs
,
and
enjoying
besides
all
the
services
of
the
devoted
Kory-Kory
,
*NL*
I
thought
that
,
for
a
sojourn
among
cannibals
,
no
man
could
have
well
*NL*
made
a
more
agreeable
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
sure
there
were
limits
set
to
my
wanderings
.
Toward
the
sea
my
*NL*
progress
was
barred
by
an
express
prohibition
of
the
savages
;
and
after
*NL*
having
made
two
or
three
ineffectual
attempts
to
reach
it
,
as
much
to
*NL*
gratify
my
curiosity
as
anything
else
,
I
gave
up
the
idea
.
It
was
in
*NL*
vain
to
think
of
reaching
it
by
stealth
,
since
the
natives
escorted
me
*NL*
in
numbers
wherever
I
went
,
and
not
for
one
single
moment
that
I
can
*NL*
recall
to
mind
was
I
ever
permitted
to
be
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
green
and
precipitous
elevations
that
stood
ranged
around
the
*NL*
head
of
the
vale
where
Marheyo
's
habitation
was
situated
effectually
*NL*
precluded
all
hope
of
escape
in
that
quarter
,
even
if
I
could
have
*NL*
stolen
away
from
the
thousand
eyes
of
the
savages
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
reflections
now
seldom
obtruded
upon
me
;
I
gave
myself
up
to
*NL*
the
passing
hour
,
and
if
ever
disagreeable
thoughts
arose
in
my
mind
,
I
*NL*
drove
them
away
.
When
I
looked
around
the
verdant
recess
in
which
I
was
*NL*
buried
,
and
gazed
up
to
the
summits
of
the
lofty
eminence
that
hemmed
me
*NL*
in
,
I
was
well
disposed
to
think
that
I
was
in
the
`
Happy
Valley
'
,
*NL*
and
that
beyond
those
heights
there
was
naught
but
a
world
of
care
*NL*
and
anxiety
.
As
I
extended
my
wanderings
in
the
valley
and
grew
more
*NL*
familiar
with
the
habits
of
its
inmates
,
I
was
fain
to
confess
that
,
*NL*
despite
the
disadvantages
of
his
condition
,
the
Polynesian
savage
,
*NL*
surrounded
by
all
the
luxurious
provisions
of
nature
,
enjoyed
an
*NL*
infinitely
happier
,
though
certainly
a
less
intellectual
existence
than
*NL*
the
self-complacent
European
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
naked
wretch
who
shivers
beneath
the
bleak
skies
,
and
starves
among
*NL*
the
inhospitable
wilds
of
Tierra-del-Fuego
,
might
indeed
be
made
happier
*NL*
by
civilization
,
for
it
would
alleviate
his
physical
wants
.
But
the
*NL*
voluptuous
Indian
,
with
every
desire
supplied
,
whom
Providence
has
*NL*
bountifully
provided
with
all
the
sources
of
pure
and
natural
enjoyment
,
*NL*
and
from
whom
are
removed
so
many
of
the
ills
and
pains
of
life
--
what
*NL*
has
he
to
desire
at
the
hands
of
Civilization
?
She
may
`
cultivate
his
*NL*
mind
--
may
elevate
his
thoughts
,
'
--
these
I
believe
are
the
established
*NL*
phrases
--
but
will
he
be
the
happier
?
Let
the
once
smiling
and
populous
*NL*
Hawaiian
islands
,
with
their
now
diseased
,
starving
,
and
dying
natives
,
*NL*
answer
the
question
.
The
missionaries
may
seek
to
disguise
the
matter
*NL*
as
they
will
,
but
the
facts
are
incontrovertible
;
and
the
devoutest
*NL*
Christian
who
visits
that
group
with
an
unbiased
mind
,
must
go
away
*NL*
mournfully
asking
--
`
Are
these
,
alas
!
the
fruits
of
twenty-five
years
of
*NL*
enlightening
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
primitive
state
of
society
,
the
enjoyments
of
life
,
though
few
*NL*
and
simple
,
are
spread
over
a
great
extent
,
and
are
unalloyed
;
but
*NL*
Civilization
,
for
every
advantage
she
imparts
,
holds
a
hundred
evils
in
*NL*
reserve
;
--
the
heart-burnings
,
the
jealousies
,
the
social
rivalries
,
*NL*
the
family
dissentions
,
and
the
thousand
self-inflicted
discomforts
of
*NL*
refined
life
,
which
make
up
in
units
the
swelling
aggregate
of
human
*NL*
misery
,
are
unknown
among
these
unsophisticated
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
will
be
urged
that
these
shocking
unprincipled
wretches
are
*NL*
cannibals
.
Very
true
;
and
a
rather
bad
trait
in
their
character
it
must
*NL*
be
allowed
.
But
they
are
such
only
when
they
seek
to
gratify
the
passion
*NL*
of
revenge
upon
their
enemies
;
and
I
ask
whether
the
mere
eating
of
*NL*
human
flesh
so
very
far
exceeds
in
barbarity
that
custom
which
only
*NL*
a
few
years
since
was
practised
in
enlightened
England
:
--
a
convicted
*NL*
traitor
,
perhaps
a
man
found
guilty
of
honesty
,
patriotism
,
and
suchlike
*NL*
heinous
crimes
,
had
his
head
lopped
off
with
a
huge
axe
,
his
bowels
*NL*
dragged
out
and
thrown
into
a
fire
;
while
his
body
,
carved
into
four
*NL*
quarters
,
was
with
his
head
exposed
upon
pikes
,
and
permitted
to
rot
and
*NL*
fester
among
the
public
haunts
of
men
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
fiend-like
skill
we
display
in
the
invention
of
all
manner
of
*NL*
death-dealing
engines
,
the
vindictiveness
with
which
we
carry
on
our
*NL*
wars
,
and
the
misery
and
desolation
that
follow
in
their
train
,
are
*NL*
enough
of
themselves
to
distinguish
the
white
civilized
man
as
the
most
*NL*
ferocious
animal
on
the
face
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
remorseless
cruelty
is
seen
in
many
of
the
institutions
of
our
own
*NL*
favoured
land
.
There
is
one
in
particular
lately
adopted
in
one
of
the
*NL*
States
of
the
Union
,
which
purports
to
have
been
dictated
by
the
most
*NL*
merciful
considerations
.
To
destroy
our
malefactors
piece-meal
,
drying
*NL*
up
in
their
veins
,
drop
by
drop
,
the
blood
we
are
too
chicken-hearted
*NL*
to
shed
by
a
single
blow
which
would
at
once
put
a
period
to
their
*NL*
sufferings
,
is
deemed
to
be
infinitely
preferable
to
the
old-fashioned
*NL*
punishment
of
gibbeting
--
much
less
annoying
to
the
victim
,
and
more
in
*NL*
accordance
with
the
refined
spirit
of
the
age
;
and
yet
how
feeble
is
all
*NL*
language
to
describe
the
horrors
we
inflict
upon
these
wretches
,
whom
we
*NL*
mason
up
in
the
cells
of
our
prisons
,
and
condemn
to
perpetual
solitude
*NL*
in
the
very
heart
of
our
population
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
is
needless
to
multiply
the
examples
of
civilized
barbarity
;
they
*NL*
far
exceed
in
the
amount
of
misery
they
cause
the
crimes
which
we
regard
*NL*
with
such
abhorrence
in
our
less
enlightened
fellow-creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
term
`
Savage
'
is
,
I
conceive
,
often
misapplied
,
and
indeed
,
when
I
*NL*
consider
the
vices
,
cruelties
,
and
enormities
of
every
kind
that
spring
*NL*
up
in
the
tainted
atmosphere
of
a
feverish
civilization
,
I
am
inclined
*NL*
to
think
that
so
far
as
the
relative
wickedness
of
the
parties
is
*NL*
concerned
,
four
or
five
Marquesan
Islanders
sent
to
the
United
States
*NL*
as
Missionaries
might
be
quite
as
useful
as
an
equal
number
of
Americans
*NL*
despatched
to
the
Islands
in
a
similar
capacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
once
heard
it
given
as
an
instance
of
the
frightful
depravity
of
a
*NL*
certain
tribe
in
the
Pacific
that
they
had
no
word
in
their
language
*NL*
to
express
the
idea
of
virtue
.
The
assertion
was
unfounded
;
but
were
*NL*
it
otherwise
,
it
might
be
met
by
stating
that
their
language
is
almost
*NL*
entirely
destitute
of
terms
to
express
the
delightful
ideas
conveyed
by
*NL*
our
endless
catalogue
of
civilized
crimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
altered
frame
of
mind
to
which
I
have
referred
,
every
object
that
*NL*
presented
itself
to
my
notice
in
the
valley
struck
me
in
a
new
light
,
*NL*
and
the
opportunities
I
now
enjoyed
of
observing
the
manners
of
its
*NL*
inmates
,
tended
to
strengthen
my
favourable
impressions
.
One
peculiarity
*NL*
that
fixed
my
admiration
was
the
perpetual
hilarity
reigning
through
the
*NL*
whole
extent
of
the
vale
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
seemed
to
be
no
cares
,
griefs
,
troubles
,
or
vexations
,
in
all
*NL*
Typee
.
The
hours
tripped
along
as
gaily
as
the
laughing
couples
down
a
*NL*
country
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
none
of
those
thousand
sources
of
irritation
that
the
*NL*
ingenuity
of
civilized
man
has
created
to
mar
his
own
felicity
.
There
*NL*
were
no
foreclosures
of
mortgages
,
no
protested
notes
,
no
bills
payable
,
*NL*
no
debts
of
honour
in
Typee
;
no
unreasonable
tailors
and
shoemakers
*NL*
perversely
bent
on
being
paid
;
no
duns
of
any
description
and
battery
*NL*
attorneys
,
to
foment
discord
,
backing
their
clients
up
to
a
quarrel
,
*NL*
and
then
knocking
their
heads
together
;
no
poor
relations
,
everlastingly
*NL*
occupying
the
spare
bed-chamber
,
and
diminishing
the
elbow
room
at
the
*NL*
family
table
;
no
destitute
widows
with
their
children
starving
on
the
*NL*
cold
charities
of
the
world
;
no
beggars
;
no
debtors
'
prisons
;
no
proud
*NL*
and
hard-hearted
nabobs
in
Typee
;
or
to
sum
up
all
in
one
word
--
no
*NL*
Money
!
`
That
root
of
all
evil
'
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
secluded
abode
of
happiness
there
were
no
cross
old
women
,
no
*NL*
cruel
step-dames
,
no
withered
spinsters
,
no
lovesick
maidens
,
no
sour
*NL*
old
bachelors
,
no
inattentive
husbands
,
no
melancholy
young
men
,
no
*NL*
blubbering
youngsters
,
and
no
squalling
brats
.
All
was
mirth
,
fun
and
*NL*
high
good
humour
.
Blue
devils
,
hypochondria
,
and
doleful
dumps
,
went
and
*NL*
hid
themselves
among
the
nooks
and
crannies
of
the
rocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
you
would
see
a
parcel
of
children
frolicking
together
the
*NL*
live-long
day
,
and
no
quarrelling
,
no
contention
,
among
them
.
The
same
*NL*
number
in
our
own
land
could
not
have
played
together
for
the
space
of
*NL*
an
hour
without
biting
or
scratching
one
another
.
There
you
might
have
*NL*
seen
a
throng
of
young
females
,
not
filled
with
envyings
of
each
other
's
*NL*
charms
,
nor
displaying
the
ridiculous
affectations
of
gentility
,
nor
*NL*
yet
moving
in
whalebone
corsets
,
like
so
many
automatons
,
but
free
,
*NL*
inartificially
happy
,
and
unconstrained
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
some
spots
in
that
sunny
vale
where
they
would
frequently
*NL*
resort
to
decorate
themselves
with
garlands
of
flowers
.
To
have
seen
*NL*
them
reclining
beneath
the
shadows
of
one
of
the
beautiful
groves
;
*NL*
the
ground
about
them
strewn
with
freshly
gathered
buds
and
blossoms
,
*NL*
employed
in
weaving
chaplets
and
necklaces
,
one
would
have
thought
*NL*
that
all
the
train
of
Flora
had
gathered
together
to
keep
a
festival
in
*NL*
honour
of
their
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
young
men
there
seemed
almost
always
some
matter
of
diversion
*NL*
or
business
on
hand
that
afforded
a
constant
variety
of
enjoyment
.
But
*NL*
whether
fishing
,
or
carving
canoes
,
or
polishing
their
ornaments
,
never
*NL*
was
there
exhibited
the
least
sign
of
strife
or
contention
among
them
.
*NL*
As
for
the
warriors
,
they
maintained
a
tranquil
dignity
of
demeanour
,
*NL*
journeying
occasionally
from
house
to
house
,
where
they
were
always
sure
*NL*
to
be
received
with
the
attention
bestowed
upon
distinguished
guests
.
*NL*
The
old
men
,
of
whom
there
were
many
in
the
vale
,
seldom
stirred
from
*NL*
their
mats
,
where
they
would
recline
for
hours
and
hours
,
smoking
and
*NL*
talking
to
one
another
with
all
the
garrulity
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
continual
happiness
,
which
so
far
as
I
was
able
to
judge
*NL*
appeared
to
prevail
in
the
valley
,
sprang
principally
from
that
*NL*
all-pervading
sensation
which
Rousseau
has
told
us
be
at
one
time
*NL*
experienced
,
the
mere
buoyant
sense
of
a
healthful
physical
existence
.
*NL*
And
indeed
in
this
particular
the
Typees
had
ample
reason
to
felicitate
*NL*
themselves
,
for
sickness
was
almost
unknown
.
During
the
whole
period
of
*NL*
my
stay
I
saw
but
one
invalid
among
them
;
and
on
their
smooth
skins
you
*NL*
observed
no
blemish
or
mark
of
disease
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
repose
,
however
,
upon
which
I
have
just
been
descanting
,
*NL*
was
broken
in
upon
about
this
time
by
an
event
which
proved
that
the
*NL*
islanders
were
not
entirely
exempt
from
those
occurrences
which
disturb
*NL*
the
quiet
of
more
civilized
communities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
now
been
a
considerable
time
in
the
valley
,
I
began
to
feel
*NL*
surprised
that
the
violent
hostility
subsisting
between
its
inhabitants
,
*NL*
and
those
of
the
adjoining
bay
of
Happar
,
should
never
have
manifested
*NL*
itself
in
any
warlike
encounter
.
Although
the
valiant
Typees
would
often
*NL*
by
gesticulations
declare
their
undying
hatred
against
their
enemies
,
*NL*
and
the
disgust
they
felt
at
their
cannibal
propensities
;
although
they
*NL*
dilated
upon
the
manifold
injuries
they
had
received
at
their
hands
,
yet
*NL*
with
a
forbearance
truly
commendable
,
they
appeared
to
sit
down
under
*NL*
their
grievances
,
and
to
refrain
from
making
any
reprisals
.
The
Happars
,
*NL*
entrenched
behind
their
mountains
,
and
never
even
showing
themselves
on
*NL*
their
summits
,
did
not
appear
to
me
to
furnish
adequate
cause
for
that
*NL*
excess
of
animosity
evinced
towards
them
by
the
heroic
tenants
of
our
*NL*
vale
,
and
I
was
inclined
to
believe
that
the
deeds
of
blood
attributed
*NL*
to
them
had
been
greatly
exaggerated
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
as
the
clamours
of
war
had
not
up
to
this
period
*NL*
disturbed
the
serenity
of
the
tribe
,
I
began
to
distrust
the
truth
of
*NL*
those
reports
which
ascribed
so
fierce
and
belligerent
a
character
to
*NL*
the
Typee
nation
.
Surely
,
thought
I
,
all
these
terrible
stories
I
have
*NL*
heard
about
the
inveteracy
with
which
they
carried
on
the
feud
,
their
*NL*
deadly
intensity
,
of
hatred
and
the
diabolical
malice
with
which
they
*NL*
glutted
their
revenge
upon
the
inanimate
forms
of
the
slain
,
are
nothing
*NL*
more
than
fables
,
and
I
must
confess
that
I
experienced
something
like
a
*NL*
sense
of
regret
at
having
my
hideous
anticipations
thus
disappointed
.
*NL*
I
felt
in
some
sort
like
a
`
prentice
boy
who
,
going
to
the
play
in
the
*NL*
expectation
of
being
delighted
with
a
cut-and-thrust
tragedy
,
is
almost
*NL*
moved
to
tears
of
disappointment
at
the
exhibition
of
a
genteel
comedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
avoid
thinking
that
I
had
fallen
in
with
a
greatly
traduced
*NL*
people
,
and
I
moralized
not
a
little
upon
the
disadvantage
of
having
a
*NL*
bad
name
,
which
in
this
instance
had
given
a
tribe
of
savages
,
who
*NL*
were
as
pacific
as
so
many
lambkins
,
the
reputation
of
a
confederacy
of
*NL*
giant-killers
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
subsequent
events
proved
that
I
had
been
a
little
too
premature
in
*NL*
coming
to
this
conclusion
.
One
,
day
about
noon
,
happening
to
be
at
the
*NL*
Ti
,
I
had
lain
down
on
the
mats
with
several
of
the
chiefs
,
and
had
*NL*
gradually
sunk
into
a
most
luxurious
siesta
,
when
I
was
awakened
by
*NL*
a
tremendous
outcry
,
and
starting
up
beheld
the
natives
seizing
their
*NL*
spears
and
hurrying
out
,
while
the
most
puissant
of
the
chiefs
,
grasping
*NL*
the
six
muskets
which
were
ranged
against
the
bamboos
,
followed
after
,
*NL*
and
soon
disappeared
in
the
groves
.
These
movements
were
accompanied
*NL*
by
wild
shouts
,
in
which
`
Happar
,
Happar
,
'
greatly
predominated
.
The
*NL*
islanders
were
now
seen
running
past
the
Ti
,
and
striking
across
the
*NL*
valley
to
the
Happar
side
.
Presently
I
heard
the
sharp
report
of
a
*NL*
musket
from
the
adjoining
hills
,
and
then
a
burst
of
voices
in
the
same
*NL*
direction
.
At
this
the
women
who
had
congregated
in
the
groves
,
set
up
*NL*
the
most
violent
clamours
,
as
they
invariably
do
here
as
elsewhere
on
*NL*
every
occasion
of
excitement
and
alarm
,
with
a
view
of
tranquillizing
*NL*
their
own
minds
and
disturbing
other
people
.
On
this
particular
*NL*
occasion
they
made
such
an
outrageous
noise
,
and
continued
it
with
such
*NL*
perseverance
,
that
for
awhile
,
had
entire
volleys
of
musketry
been
fired
*NL*
off
in
the
neighbouring
mountains
,
I
should
not
have
been
able
to
have
*NL*
heard
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
female
commotion
had
a
little
subsided
I
listened
eagerly
for
*NL*
further
information
.
At
last
bang
went
another
shot
,
and
then
a
second
*NL*
volley
of
yells
from
the
hills
.
Again
all
was
quiet
,
and
continued
so
*NL*
for
such
a
length
of
time
that
I
began
to
think
the
contending
armies
*NL*
had
agreed
upon
a
suspension
of
hostilities
;
when
pop
went
a
third
gun
,
*NL*
followed
as
before
with
a
yell
.
After
this
,
for
nearly
two
hours
*NL*
nothing
occurred
worthy
of
comment
,
save
some
straggling
shouts
from
the
*NL*
hillside
,
sounding
like
the
halloos
of
a
parcel
of
truant
boys
who
had
*NL*
lost
themselves
in
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
interval
I
had
remained
standing
on
the
piazza
of
the
`
Ti
,
'
*NL*
which
directly
fronted
the
Happar
mountain
,
and
with
no
one
near
me
*NL*
but
Kory-Kory
and
the
old
superannuated
savages
I
have
described
.
These
*NL*
latter
never
stirred
from
their
mats
,
and
seemed
altogether
unconscious
*NL*
that
anything
unusual
was
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Kory-Kory
,
he
appeared
to
think
that
we
were
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
great
events
,
and
sought
most
zealously
to
impress
me
with
a
due
sense
*NL*
of
their
importance
.
Every
sound
that
reached
us
conveyed
some
momentous
*NL*
item
of
intelligence
to
him
.
At
such
times
,
as
if
he
were
gifted
with
*NL*
second
sight
,
he
would
go
through
a
variety
of
pantomimic
illustrations
,
*NL*
showing
me
the
precise
manner
in
which
the
redoubtable
Typees
were
at
*NL*
that
very
moment
chastising
the
insolence
of
the
enemy
.
`
Mehevi
hanna
*NL*
pippee
nuee
Happar
,
'
he
exclaimed
every
five
minutes
,
giving
me
to
*NL*
understand
that
under
that
distinguished
captain
the
warriors
of
his
*NL*
nation
were
performing
prodigies
of
valour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
heard
only
four
reports
from
the
muskets
,
I
was
led
to
believe
*NL*
that
they
were
worked
by
the
islanders
in
the
same
manner
as
the
Sultan
*NL*
Solyman
's
ponderous
artillery
at
the
siege
of
Byzantium
,
one
of
them
*NL*
taking
an
hour
or
two
to
load
and
train
.
At
last
,
no
sound
whatever
*NL*
proceeding
from
the
mountains
,
I
concluded
that
the
contest
had
been
*NL*
determined
one
way
or
the
other
.
Such
appeared
,
indeed
,
to
be
the
case
,
*NL*
for
in
a
little
while
a
courier
arrived
at
the
`
Ti
'
,
almost
breathless
*NL*
with
his
exertions
,
and
communicated
the
news
of
a
great
victory
having
*NL*
been
achieved
by
his
countrymen
:
`
Happar
poo
arva
!
--
Happar
poo
arva
!
'
*NL*
-LRB-
the
cowards
had
fled
-RRB-
.
Kory-Kory
was
in
ecstasies
,
and
commenced
a
*NL*
vehement
harangue
,
which
,
so
far
as
I
understood
it
,
implied
that
the
*NL*
result
exactly
agreed
with
his
expectations
,
and
which
,
moreover
,
*NL*
was
intended
to
convince
me
that
it
would
be
a
perfectly
useless
*NL*
undertaking
,
even
for
an
army
of
fire-eaters
,
to
offer
battle
to
the
*NL*
irresistible
heroes
of
our
valley
.
In
all
this
I
of
course
acquiesced
,
*NL*
and
looked
forward
with
no
little
interest
to
the
return
of
the
*NL*
conquerors
,
whose
victory
I
feared
might
not
have
been
purchased
without
*NL*
cost
to
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
I
was
again
mistaken
;
for
Mehevi
,
in
conducting
his
warlike
*NL*
operations
,
rather
inclined
to
the
Fabian
than
to
the
Bonapartean
*NL*
tactics
,
husbanding
his
resources
and
exposing
his
troops
to
no
*NL*
unnecessary
hazards
.
The
total
loss
of
the
victors
in
this
obstinately
*NL*
contested
affair
was
,
in
killed
,
wounded
,
and
missing
--
one
forefinger
*NL*
and
part
of
a
thumb-nail
-LRB-
which
the
late
proprietor
brought
along
with
*NL*
him
in
his
hand
-RRB-
,
a
severely
contused
arm
,
and
a
considerable
effusion
*NL*
of
blood
flowing
from
the
thigh
of
a
chief
,
who
had
received
an
ugly
*NL*
thrust
from
a
Happar
spear
.
What
the
enemy
had
suffered
I
could
not
*NL*
discover
,
but
I
presume
they
had
succeeded
in
taking
off
with
them
the
*NL*
bodies
of
their
slain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
issue
of
the
battle
,
as
far
as
its
results
came
under
my
*NL*
observation
:
and
as
it
appeared
to
be
considered
an
event
of
prodigious
*NL*
importance
,
I
reasonably
concluded
that
the
wars
of
the
natives
were
*NL*
marked
by
no
very
sanguinary
traits
.
I
afterwards
learned
how
the
*NL*
skirmish
had
originated
.
A
number
of
the
Happars
had
been
discovered
*NL*
prowling
for
no
good
purpose
on
the
Typee
side
of
the
mountain
;
the
*NL*
alarm
sounded
,
and
the
invaders
,
after
a
protracted
resistance
,
had
been
*NL*
chased
over
the
frontier
.
But
why
had
not
the
intrepid
Mehevi
carried
*NL*
the
war
into
Happar
?
Why
had
he
not
made
a
descent
into
the
hostile
*NL*
vale
,
and
brought
away
some
trophy
of
his
victory
--
some
materials
for
*NL*
the
cannibal
entertainment
which
I
had
heard
usually
terminated
every
*NL*
engagement
?
After
all
,
I
was
much
inclined
to
believe
that
these
*NL*
shocking
festivals
must
occur
very
rarely
among
the
islanders
,
if
,
*NL*
indeed
,
they
ever
take
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
or
three
days
the
late
event
was
the
theme
of
general
comment
;
*NL*
after
which
the
excitement
gradually
wore
away
,
and
the
valley
resumed
*NL*
its
accustomed
tranquility
.

RETURNING
health
and
peace
of
mind
gave
a
new
interest
to
everything
*NL*
around
me
.
I
sought
to
diversify
my
time
by
as
many
enjoyments
as
lay
*NL*
within
my
reach
.
Bathing
in
company
with
troops
of
girls
formed
one
of
*NL*
my
chief
amusements
.
We
sometimes
enjoyed
the
recreation
in
the
waters
*NL*
of
a
miniature
lake
,
to
which
the
central
stream
of
the
valley
expanded
.
*NL*
This
lovely
sheet
of
water
was
almost
circular
in
figure
,
and
about
*NL*
three
hundred
yards
across
.
Its
beauty
was
indescribable
.
All
around
*NL*
its
banks
waved
luxuriant
masses
of
tropical
foliage
,
soaring
high
above
*NL*
which
were
seen
,
here
and
there
,
the
symmetrical
shaft
of
the
cocoanut
*NL*
tree
,
surmounted
by
its
tufts
of
graceful
branches
,
drooping
in
the
air
*NL*
like
so
many
waving
ostrich
plumes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ease
and
grace
with
which
the
maidens
of
the
valley
propelled
*NL*
themselves
through
the
water
,
and
their
familiarity
with
the
element
,
*NL*
were
truly
astonishing
.
Sometimes
they
might
be
seen
gliding
along
just
*NL*
under
the
surface
,
without
apparently
moving
hand
or
foot
--
then
throwing
*NL*
themselves
on
their
sides
,
they
darted
through
the
water
,
revealing
*NL*
glimpses
of
their
forms
,
as
,
in
the
course
of
their
rapid
progress
,
they
*NL*
shot
for
an
instant
partly
into
the
air
--
at
one
moment
they
dived
deep
*NL*
down
into
the
water
,
and
the
next
they
rose
bounding
to
the
surface
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
remember
upon
one
occasion
plunging
in
among
a
parcel
of
these
*NL*
river-nymphs
,
and
counting
vainly
on
my
superior
strength
,
sought
to
*NL*
drag
some
of
them
under
the
water
,
but
I
quickly
repented
my
temerity
.
*NL*
The
amphibious
young
creatures
swarmed
about
me
like
a
shoal
of
*NL*
dolphins
,
and
seizing
hold
of
my
devoted
limbs
,
tumbled
me
about
and
*NL*
ducked
me
under
the
surface
,
until
from
the
strange
noises
which
rang
in
*NL*
my
ears
,
and
the
supernatural
visions
dancing
before
my
eyes
,
I
thought
*NL*
I
was
in
the
land
of
the
spirits
.
I
stood
indeed
as
little
chance
among
*NL*
them
as
a
cumbrous
whale
attacked
on
all
sides
by
a
legion
of
swordfish
.
*NL*
When
at
length
they
relinquished
their
hold
of
me
,
they
swam
away
in
*NL*
every
direction
,
laughing
at
my
clumsy
endeavours
to
reach
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
boat
on
the
lake
;
but
at
my
solicitation
and
for
my
special
*NL*
use
,
some
of
the
young
men
attached
to
Marheyo
's
household
,
under
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
indefatigable
Kory-Kory
,
brought
up
a
light
and
*NL*
tastefully
carved
canoe
from
the
sea
.
It
was
launched
upon
the
sheet
*NL*
of
water
,
and
floated
there
as
gracefully
as
a
swan
.
But
,
melancholy
to
*NL*
relate
,
it
produced
an
effect
I
had
not
anticipated
.
The
sweet
nymphs
,
*NL*
who
had
sported
with
me
before
on
the
lake
,
now
all
fled
its
vicinity
.
*NL*
The
prohibited
craft
,
guarded
by
the
edicts
of
the
`
taboo
,
'
extended
the
*NL*
prohibition
to
the
waters
in
which
it
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
few
days
,
Kory-Kory
,
with
one
or
two
other
youths
,
accompanied
*NL*
me
in
my
excursions
to
the
lake
,
and
while
I
paddled
about
in
my
light
*NL*
canoe
,
would
swim
after
me
shouting
and
gambolling
in
pursuit
.
But
I
*NL*
as
ever
partial
to
what
is
termed
in
the
`
Young
Men
's
Own
Book
'
--
`
the
*NL*
society
of
virtuous
and
intelligent
young
ladies
;
'
and
in
the
absence
*NL*
of
the
mermaids
,
the
amusement
became
dull
and
insipid
.
One
morning
*NL*
I
expressed
to
my
faithful
servitor
my
desire
for
the
return
of
the
*NL*
nymphs
.
The
honest
fellow
looked
at
me
bewildered
for
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
then
shook
his
head
solemnly
,
and
murmured
`
taboo
!
taboo
!
'
giving
me
to
*NL*
understand
that
unless
the
canoe
was
removed
I
could
not
expect
to
have
*NL*
the
young
ladies
back
again
.
But
to
this
procedure
I
was
averse
;
I
not
*NL*
only
wanted
the
canoe
to
stay
where
it
was
,
but
I
wanted
the
beauteous
*NL*
Fayaway
to
get
into
it
,
and
paddle
with
me
about
the
lake
.
This
latter
*NL*
proposition
completely
horrified
Kory-Kory
's
notions
of
propriety
.
He
*NL*
inveighed
against
it
,
as
something
too
monstrous
to
be
thought
of
.
It
*NL*
not
only
shocked
their
established
notions
of
propriety
,
but
was
at
*NL*
variance
with
all
their
religious
ordinances
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
although
the
`
taboo
'
was
a
ticklish
thing
to
meddle
with
,
I
*NL*
determined
to
test
its
capabilities
of
resisting
an
attack
.
I
consulted
*NL*
the
chief
Mehevi
,
who
endeavoured
to
dissuade
me
from
my
object
;
but
*NL*
I
was
not
to
be
repulsed
;
and
accordingly
increased
the
warmth
of
my
*NL*
solicitations
.
At
last
he
entered
into
a
long
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
a
*NL*
very
learned
and
eloquent
exposition
of
the
history
and
nature
of
the
*NL*
`
taboo
'
as
affecting
this
particular
case
;
employing
a
variety
of
most
*NL*
extraordinary
words
,
which
,
from
their
amazing
length
and
sonorousness
,
*NL*
I
have
every
reason
to
believe
were
of
a
theological
nature
.
But
all
*NL*
that
he
said
failed
to
convince
me
:
partly
,
perhaps
,
because
I
could
not
*NL*
comprehend
a
word
that
he
uttered
;
but
chiefly
,
that
for
the
life
of
me
*NL*
I
could
not
understand
why
a
woman
would
not
have
as
much
right
to
*NL*
enter
a
canoe
as
a
man
.
At
last
he
became
a
little
more
rational
,
and
*NL*
intimated
that
,
out
of
the
abundant
love
he
bore
me
,
he
would
consult
*NL*
with
the
priests
and
see
what
could
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
it
was
that
the
priesthood
of
Typee
satisfied
the
affair
with
their
*NL*
consciences
,
I
know
not
;
but
so
it
was
,
and
Fayaway
dispensation
from
*NL*
this
portion
of
the
taboo
was
at
length
procured
.
Such
an
event
I
*NL*
believe
never
before
had
occurred
in
the
valley
;
but
it
was
high
time
*NL*
the
islanders
should
be
taught
a
little
gallantry
,
and
I
trust
that
the
*NL*
example
I
set
them
may
produce
beneficial
effects
.
Ridiculous
,
indeed
,
*NL*
that
the
lovely
creatures
should
be
obliged
to
paddle
about
in
the
*NL*
water
,
like
so
many
ducks
,
while
a
parcel
of
great
strapping
fellows
*NL*
skimmed
over
its
surface
in
their
canoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
day
after
Fayaway
's
emancipation
,
I
had
a
delightful
little
*NL*
party
on
the
lake
--
the
damsels
'
Kory-Kory
,
and
myself
.
My
zealous
*NL*
body-servant
brought
from
the
house
a
calabash
of
poee-poee
,
half
a
*NL*
dozen
young
cocoanuts
--
stripped
of
their
husks
--
three
pipes
,
as
many
*NL*
yams
,
and
me
on
his
back
a
part
of
the
way
.
Something
of
a
load
;
but
*NL*
Kory-Kory
was
a
very
strong
man
for
his
size
,
and
by
no
means
brittle
in
*NL*
the
spine
.
We
had
a
very
pleasant
day
;
my
trusty
valet
plied
the
paddle
*NL*
and
swept
us
gently
along
the
margin
of
the
water
,
beneath
the
shades
*NL*
of
the
overhanging
thickets
.
Fayaway
and
I
reclined
in
the
stern
of
*NL*
the
canoe
,
on
the
very
best
terms
possible
with
one
another
;
the
gentle
*NL*
nymph
occasionally
placing
her
pipe
to
her
lip
,
and
exhaling
the
mild
*NL*
fumes
of
the
tobacco
,
to
which
her
rosy
breath
added
a
fresh
perfume
.
*NL*
Strange
as
it
may
seem
,
there
is
nothing
in
which
a
young
and
beautiful
*NL*
female
appears
to
more
advantage
than
in
the
act
of
smoking
.
How
*NL*
captivating
is
a
Peruvian
lady
,
swinging
in
her
gaily-woven
hammock
of
*NL*
grass
,
extended
between
two
orange-trees
,
and
inhaling
the
fragrance
of
*NL*
a
choice
cigarro
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fayaway
,
holding
in
her
delicately
formed
olive
hand
the
long
yellow
*NL*
reed
of
her
pipe
,
with
its
quaintly
carved
bowl
,
and
every
few
moments
*NL*
languishingly
giving
forth
light
wreaths
of
vapour
from
her
mouth
and
*NL*
nostrils
,
looked
still
more
engaging
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
floated
about
thus
for
several
hours
,
when
I
looked
up
to
the
warm
,
*NL*
glowing
,
tropical
sky
,
and
then
down
into
the
transparent
depths
below
;
*NL*
and
when
my
eye
,
wandering
from
the
bewitching
scenery
around
,
fell
upon
*NL*
the
grotesquely-tattooed
form
of
Kory-Kory
,
and
finally
,
encountered
the
*NL*
pensive
gaze
of
Fayaway
,
I
thought
I
had
been
transported
to
some
fairy
*NL*
region
,
so
unreal
did
everything
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
lovely
piece
of
water
was
the
coolest
spot
in
all
the
valley
,
and
I
*NL*
now
made
it
a
place
of
continual
resort
during
the
hottest
period
of
*NL*
the
day
.
One
side
of
it
lay
near
the
termination
of
a
long
gradually
*NL*
expanding
gorge
,
which
mounted
to
the
heights
that
environed
the
vale
.
*NL*
The
strong
trade
wind
,
met
in
its
course
by
these
elevations
,
circled
*NL*
and
eddied
about
their
summits
,
and
was
sometimes
driven
down
the
*NL*
steep
ravine
and
swept
across
the
valley
,
ruffling
in
its
passage
the
*NL*
otherwise
tranquil
surface
of
the
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
after
we
had
been
paddling
about
for
some
time
,
I
disembarked
*NL*
Kory-Kory
,
and
paddled
the
canoe
to
the
windward
side
of
the
lake
.
As
*NL*
I
turned
the
canoe
,
Fayaway
,
who
was
with
me
,
seemed
all
at
once
to
be
*NL*
struck
with
some
happy
idea
.
With
a
wild
exclamation
of
delight
,
she
*NL*
disengaged
from
her
person
the
ample
robe
of
tappa
which
was
knotted
*NL*
over
her
shoulder
-LRB-
for
the
purpose
of
shielding
her
from
the
sun
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
spreading
it
out
like
a
sail
,
stood
erect
with
upraised
arms
in
the
head
*NL*
of
the
canoe
.
We
American
sailors
pride
ourselves
upon
our
straight
,
*NL*
clean
spars
,
but
a
prettier
little
mast
than
Fayaway
made
was
never
*NL*
shipped
aboard
of
any
craft
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
moment
the
tappa
was
distended
by
the
breeze
--
the
long
brown
*NL*
tresses
of
Fayaway
streamed
in
the
air
--
and
the
canoe
glided
rapidly
*NL*
through
the
water
,
and
shot
towards
the
shore
.
Seated
in
the
stern
,
I
*NL*
directed
its
course
with
my
paddle
until
it
dashed
up
the
soft
sloping
*NL*
bank
,
and
Fayaway
,
with
a
light
spring
alighted
on
the
ground
;
whilst
*NL*
Kory-Kory
,
who
had
watched
our
manoeuvres
with
admiration
,
now
*NL*
clapped
his
hands
in
transport
,
and
shouted
like
a
madman
.
Many
a
time
*NL*
afterwards
was
this
feat
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
reader
has
not
observed
ere
this
that
I
was
the
declared
admirer
*NL*
of
Miss
Fayaway
,
all
I
can
say
is
that
he
is
little
conversant
with
*NL*
affairs
of
the
heart
,
and
I
certainly
shall
not
trouble
myself
to
*NL*
enlighten
him
any
farther
.
Out
of
the
calico
I
had
brought
from
the
ship
*NL*
I
made
a
dress
for
this
lovely
girl
.
In
it
she
looked
,
I
must
confess
,
*NL*
something
like
an
opera-dancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drapery
of
the
latter
damsel
generally
commences
a
little
above
*NL*
the
elbows
,
but
my
island
beauty
's
began
at
the
waist
,
and
terminated
*NL*
sufficiently
far
above
the
ground
to
reveal
the
most
bewitching
ankle
in
*NL*
the
universe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
that
Fayaway
first
wore
this
robe
was
rendered
memorable
by
a
*NL*
new
acquaintance
being
introduced
to
me
.
In
the
afternoon
I
was
lying
*NL*
in
the
house
when
I
heard
a
great
uproar
outside
;
but
being
by
this
time
*NL*
pretty
well
accustomed
to
the
wild
halloos
which
were
almost
continually
*NL*
ringing
through
the
valley
,
I
paid
little
attention
to
it
,
until
old
*NL*
Marheyo
,
under
the
influence
of
some
strange
excitement
,
rushed
into
my
*NL*
presence
and
communicated
the
astounding
tidings
,
`
Marnoo
pemi
!
'
which
*NL*
being
interpreted
,
implied
that
an
individual
by
the
name
of
Marnoo
was
*NL*
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
worthy
old
friend
evidently
expected
that
this
intelligence
would
*NL*
produce
a
great
effect
upon
me
,
and
for
a
time
he
stood
earnestly
*NL*
regarding
me
,
as
if
curious
to
see
how
I
should
conduct
myself
,
but
as
*NL*
I
remained
perfectly
unmoved
,
the
old
gentleman
darted
out
of
the
house
*NL*
again
,
in
as
great
a
hurry
as
he
had
entered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Marnoo
,
Marnoo
,
'
cogitated
I
,
'
I
have
never
heard
that
name
before
.
*NL*
Some
distinguished
character
,
I
presume
,
from
the
prodigious
riot
the
*NL*
natives
are
making
;
'
the
tumultuous
noise
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
*NL*
every
moment
,
while
`
Marnoo
!
--
Marnoo
!
'
was
shouted
by
every
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
made
up
my
mind
that
some
savage
warrior
of
consequence
,
who
had
*NL*
not
yet
enjoyed
the
honour
of
an
audience
,
was
desirous
of
paying
his
*NL*
respects
on
the
present
occasion
.
So
vain
had
I
become
by
the
lavish
*NL*
attention
to
which
I
had
been
accustomed
,
that
I
felt
half
inclined
,
*NL*
as
a
punishment
for
such
neglect
,
to
give
this
Marnoo
a
cold
reception
,
*NL*
when
the
excited
throng
came
within
view
,
convoying
one
of
the
most
*NL*
striking
specimens
of
humanity
that
I
ever
beheld
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
could
not
have
been
more
than
twenty-five
years
of
age
,
and
*NL*
was
a
little
above
the
ordinary
height
;
had
he
a
single
hair
's
breadth
*NL*
taller
,
the
matchless
symmetry
of
his
form
would
have
been
destroyed
.
*NL*
His
unclad
limbs
were
beautifully
formed
;
whilst
the
elegant
outline
of
*NL*
his
figure
,
together
with
his
beardless
cheeks
,
might
have
entitled
him
*NL*
to
the
distinction
of
standing
for
the
statue
of
the
Polynesian
Apollo
;
*NL*
and
indeed
the
oval
of
his
countenance
and
the
regularity
of
every
*NL*
feature
reminded
one
of
an
antique
bust
.
But
the
marble
repose
of
art
*NL*
was
supplied
by
a
warmth
and
liveliness
of
expression
only
to
be
seen
in
*NL*
the
South
Sea
Islander
under
the
most
favourable
developments
of
nature
.
*NL*
The
hair
of
Marnoo
was
a
rich
curling
brown
,
and
twined
about
his
*NL*
temples
and
neck
in
little
close
curling
ringlets
,
which
danced
up
and
*NL*
down
continually
,
when
he
was
animated
in
conversation
.
His
cheek
was
*NL*
of
a
feminine
softness
,
and
his
face
was
free
from
the
least
blemish
*NL*
of
tattooing
,
although
the
rest
of
his
body
was
drawn
all
over
with
*NL*
fanciful
figures
,
which
--
unlike
the
unconnected
sketching
usual
among
*NL*
these
natives
--
appeared
to
have
been
executed
in
conformity
with
some
*NL*
general
design
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tattooing
on
his
back
in
particular
attracted
my
attention
.
The
*NL*
artist
employed
must
indeed
have
excelled
in
his
profession
.
Traced
*NL*
along
the
course
of
the
spine
was
accurately
delineated
the
slender
,
*NL*
tapering
and
diamond
checkered
shaft
of
the
beautiful
`
artu
'
tree
.
*NL*
Branching
from
the
stem
on
each
side
,
and
disposed
alternately
,
were
*NL*
the
graceful
branches
drooping
with
leaves
all
correctly
drawn
and
*NL*
elaborately
finished
.
Indeed
the
best
specimen
of
the
Fine
Arts
I
had
*NL*
yet
seen
in
Typee
.
A
rear
view
of
the
stranger
might
have
suggested
the
*NL*
idea
of
a
spreading
vine
tacked
against
a
garden
wall
.
Upon
his
breast
,
*NL*
arms
and
legs
,
were
exhibited
an
infinite
variety
of
figures
;
every
*NL*
one
of
which
,
however
,
appeared
to
have
reference
to
the
general
*NL*
effect
sought
to
be
produced
.
The
tattooing
I
have
described
was
of
the
*NL*
brightest
blue
,
and
when
contrasted
with
the
light
olive-colour
of
the
*NL*
skin
,
produced
an
unique
and
even
elegant
effect
.
A
slight
girdle
of
*NL*
white
tappa
,
scarcely
two
inches
in
width
,
but
hanging
before
and
behind
*NL*
in
spreading
tassels
,
composed
the
entire
costume
of
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
advanced
surrounded
by
the
islanders
,
carrying
under
one
arm
a
small
*NL*
roll
of
native
cloth
,
and
grasping
in
his
other
hand
a
long
and
richly
*NL*
decorated
spear
.
His
manner
was
that
of
a
traveller
conscious
that
he
is
*NL*
approaching
a
comfortable
stage
in
his
journey
.
Every
moment
he
turned
*NL*
good-humouredly
on
the
throng
around
him
,
and
gave
some
dashing
sort
of
*NL*
reply
to
their
incessant
queries
,
which
appeared
to
convulse
them
with
*NL*
uncontrollable
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Struck
by
his
demeanour
,
and
the
peculiarity
of
his
appearance
,
so
*NL*
unlike
that
of
the
shaven-crowned
and
face-tattooed
natives
in
general
,
*NL*
I
involuntarily
rose
as
he
entered
the
house
,
and
proffered
him
a
seat
*NL*
on
the
mats
beside
me
.
But
without
deigning
to
notice
the
civility
,
or
*NL*
even
the
more
incontrovertible
fact
of
my
existence
,
the
stranger
passed
*NL*
on
,
utterly
regardless
of
me
,
and
flung
himself
upon
the
further
end
*NL*
of
the
long
couch
that
traversed
the
sole
apartment
of
Marheyo
's
*NL*
habitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
belle
of
the
season
,
in
the
pride
of
her
beauty
and
power
,
been
*NL*
cut
in
a
place
of
public
resort
by
some
supercilious
exquisite
,
she
*NL*
could
not
have
felt
greater
indignation
than
I
did
at
this
unexpected
*NL*
slight
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
thrown
into
utter
astonishment
.
The
conduct
of
the
savages
had
*NL*
prepared
me
to
anticipate
from
every
newcomer
the
same
extravagant
*NL*
expressions
of
curiosity
and
regard
.
The
singularity
of
his
conduct
,
*NL*
however
,
only
roused
my
desire
to
discover
who
this
remarkable
personage
*NL*
might
be
,
who
now
engrossed
the
attention
of
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tinor
placed
before
him
a
calabash
of
poee-poee
,
from
which
the
stranger
*NL*
regaled
himself
,
alternating
every
mouthful
with
some
rapid
exclamation
,
*NL*
which
was
eagerly
caught
up
and
echoed
by
the
crowd
that
completely
*NL*
filled
the
house
.
When
I
observed
the
striking
devotion
of
the
natives
*NL*
to
him
,
and
their
temporary
withdrawal
of
all
attention
from
myself
,
I
*NL*
felt
not
a
little
piqued
.
The
glory
of
Tommo
is
departed
,
thought
I
,
and
*NL*
the
sooner
he
removes
from
the
valley
the
better
.
These
were
my
feelings
*NL*
at
the
moment
,
and
they
were
prompted
by
that
glorious
principle
*NL*
inherent
in
all
heroic
natures
--
the
strong-rooted
determination
to
have
*NL*
the
biggest
share
of
the
pudding
or
to
go
without
any
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marnoo
,
that
all-attractive
personage
,
having
satisfied
his
hunger
and
*NL*
inhaled
a
few
whiffs
from
a
pipe
which
was
handed
to
him
,
launched
*NL*
out
into
an
harangue
which
completely
enchained
the
attention
of
his
*NL*
auditors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
as
I
understood
of
the
language
,
yet
from
his
animated
gestures
*NL*
and
the
varying
expression
of
his
features
--
reflected
as
from
so
many
*NL*
mirrors
in
the
countenances
around
him
,
I
could
easily
discover
the
*NL*
nature
of
those
passions
which
he
sought
to
arouse
.
From
the
frequent
*NL*
recurrence
of
the
words
`
Nukuheva
'
and
`
Frannee
'
-LRB-
French
-RRB-
,
and
some
*NL*
others
with
the
meaning
of
which
I
was
acquainted
,
he
appeared
to
be
*NL*
rehearsing
to
his
auditors
events
which
had
recently
occurred
in
the
*NL*
neighbouring
bays
.
But
how
he
had
gained
the
knowledge
of
these
matters
*NL*
I
could
not
understand
,
unless
it
were
that
he
had
just
come
from
*NL*
Nukuheva
--
a
supposition
which
his
travel-stained
appearance
not
a
little
*NL*
supported
.
But
,
if
a
native
of
that
region
,
I
could
not
account
for
his
*NL*
friendly
reception
at
the
hands
of
the
Typees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
,
certainly
,
had
I
beheld
so
powerful
an
exhibition
of
natural
*NL*
eloquence
as
Marnoo
displayed
during
the
course
of
his
oration
.
The
*NL*
grace
of
the
attitudes
into
which
he
threw
his
flexible
figure
,
the
*NL*
striking
gestures
of
his
naked
arms
,
and
above
all
,
the
fire
which
shot
*NL*
from
his
brilliant
eyes
,
imparted
an
effect
to
the
continually
changing
*NL*
accents
of
his
voice
,
of
which
the
most
accomplished
orator
might
have
*NL*
been
proud
.
At
one
moment
reclining
sideways
upon
the
mat
,
and
leaning
*NL*
calmly
upon
his
bended
arm
,
he
related
circumstantially
the
aggressions
*NL*
of
the
French
--
their
hostile
visits
to
the
surrounding
bays
,
enumerating
*NL*
each
one
in
succession
--
Happar
,
Puerka
,
Nukuheva
,
Tior
,
--
and
then
*NL*
starting
to
his
feet
and
precipitating
himself
forward
with
clenched
*NL*
hands
and
a
countenance
distorted
with
passion
,
he
poured
out
a
tide
of
*NL*
invectives
.
Falling
back
into
an
attitude
of
lofty
command
,
he
exhorted
*NL*
the
Typees
to
resist
these
encroachments
;
reminding
them
,
with
a
fierce
*NL*
glance
of
exultation
,
that
as
yet
the
terror
of
their
name
had
preserved
*NL*
them
from
attack
,
and
with
a
scornful
sneer
he
sketched
in
ironical
*NL*
terms
the
wondrous
intrepidity
of
the
French
,
who
,
with
five
war-canoes
*NL*
and
hundreds
of
men
,
had
not
dared
to
assail
the
naked
warriors
of
their
*NL*
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
effect
he
produced
upon
his
audience
was
electric
;
one
and
all
they
*NL*
stood
regarding
him
with
sparkling
eyes
and
trembling
limbs
,
as
though
*NL*
they
were
listening
to
the
inspired
voice
of
a
prophet
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
soon
appeared
that
Marnoo
's
powers
were
as
versatile
as
they
*NL*
were
extraordinary
.
As
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
vehement
harangue
,
he
*NL*
threw
himself
again
upon
the
mats
,
and
,
singling
out
individuals
in
the
*NL*
crowd
,
addressed
them
by
name
,
in
a
sort
of
bantering
style
,
the
humour
*NL*
of
which
,
though
nearly
hidden
from
me
filled
the
whole
assembly
with
*NL*
uproarious
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
word
for
everybody
;
and
,
turning
rapidly
from
one
to
another
,
*NL*
gave
utterance
to
some
hasty
witticism
,
which
was
sure
to
be
followed
*NL*
by
peals
of
laughter
.
To
the
females
as
well
as
to
the
men
,
he
addressed
*NL*
his
discourse
.
Heaven
only
knows
what
he
said
to
them
,
but
he
caused
*NL*
smiles
and
blushes
to
mantle
their
ingenuous
faces
.
I
am
,
indeed
,
very
*NL*
much
inclined
to
believe
that
Marnoo
,
with
his
handsome
person
and
*NL*
captivating
manners
,
was
a
sad
deceiver
among
the
simple
maidens
of
the
*NL*
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
this
time
he
had
never
,
for
one
moment
,
deigned
to
regard
me
.
*NL*
He
appeared
,
indeed
,
to
be
altogether
unconscious
of
my
presence
.
I
*NL*
was
utterly
at
a
loss
how
to
account
for
this
extraordinary
conduct
.
I
*NL*
easily
perceived
that
he
was
a
man
of
no
little
consequence
among
the
*NL*
islanders
;
that
he
possessed
uncommon
talents
;
and
was
gifted
with
a
*NL*
higher
degree
of
knowledge
than
the
inmates
of
the
valley
.
For
these
*NL*
reasons
,
I
therefore
greatly
feared
lest
having
,
from
some
cause
or
*NL*
other
,
unfriendly
feelings
towards
me
,
he
might
exert
his
powerful
*NL*
influence
to
do
me
mischief
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
evident
that
he
was
not
a
permanent
resident
of
the
vale
,
and
*NL*
yet
,
whence
could
he
have
come
?
On
all
sides
the
Typees
were
girt
in
by
*NL*
hostile
tribes
,
and
how
could
he
possibly
,
if
belonging
to
any
of
these
,
*NL*
be
received
with
so
much
cordiality
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
personal
appearance
of
the
enigmatical
stranger
suggested
additional
*NL*
perplexities
.
The
face
,
free
from
tattooing
,
and
the
unshaven
crown
,
*NL*
were
peculiarities
I
had
never
before
remarked
in
any
part
of
the
*NL*
island
,
and
I
had
always
heard
that
the
contrary
were
considered
the
*NL*
indispensable
distinction
of
a
Marquesan
warrior
.
Altogether
the
matter
*NL*
was
perfectly
incomprehensible
to
me
,
and
I
awaited
its
solution
with
no
*NL*
small
degree
of
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
from
certain
indications
,
I
suspected
that
he
was
making
me
*NL*
the
subject
of
his
remarks
,
although
he
appeared
cautiously
to
avoid
*NL*
either
pronouncing
my
name
,
or
looking
in
the
direction
where
I
lay
.
All
*NL*
at
once
he
rose
from
the
mats
where
he
had
been
reclining
,
and
,
still
*NL*
conversing
,
moved
towards
me
,
his
eye
purposely
evading
mine
,
and
seated
*NL*
himself
within
less
than
a
yard
of
me
.
I
had
hardly
recovered
from
my
*NL*
surprise
,
when
he
suddenly
turned
round
,
and
,
with
a
most
benignant
*NL*
countenance
extended
his
right
hand
gracefully
towards
me
.
Of
course
I
*NL*
accepted
the
courteous
challenge
,
and
,
as
soon
as
our
palms
met
,
he
bent
*NL*
towards
me
,
and
murmured
in
musical
accents
--
`
How
you
do
?
'
`
How
long
you
*NL*
been
in
this
bay
?
'
`
You
like
this
bay
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
Had
I
been
pierced
simultaneously
by
three
Happar
spears
,
I
could
not
*NL*
have
started
more
than
I
did
at
hearing
these
simple
questions
.
For
a
*NL*
moment
I
was
overwhelmed
with
astonishment
,
and
then
answered
something
*NL*
I
know
not
what
;
but
as
soon
as
I
regained
my
self-possession
,
the
*NL*
thought
darted
through
my
mind
that
from
this
individual
I
might
obtain
*NL*
that
information
regarding
Toby
which
I
suspected
the
natives
had
*NL*
purposely
withheld
from
me
.
Accordingly
I
questioned
him
concerning
*NL*
the
disappearance
of
my
companion
,
but
he
denied
all
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
matter
.
I
then
inquired
from
whence
he
had
come
?
He
replied
,
from
*NL*
Nukuheva
.
When
I
expressed
my
surprise
,
he
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
as
if
enjoying
my
perplexity
,
and
then
with
his
strange
vivacity
,
*NL*
exclaimed
,
--
`
Ah
!
Me
taboo
,
--
me
go
Nukuheva
,
--
me
go
Tior
,
--
me
go
*NL*
Typee
,
--
me
go
everywhere
,
--
nobody
harm
me
,
--
me
taboo
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
This
explanation
would
have
been
altogether
unintelligible
to
me
,
had
*NL*
it
not
recalled
to
my
mind
something
I
had
previously
heard
concerning
*NL*
a
singular
custom
among
these
islanders
.
Though
the
country
is
possessed
*NL*
by
various
tribes
,
whose
mutual
hostilities
almost
wholly
prelude
any
*NL*
intercourse
between
them
;
yet
there
are
instances
where
a
person
having
*NL*
ratified
friendly
relations
with
some
individual
belonging
longing
to
*NL*
the
valley
,
whose
inmates
are
at
war
with
his
own
,
may
,
under
particular
*NL*
restrictions
,
venture
with
impunity
into
the
country
of
his
friend
,
*NL*
where
,
under
other
circumstances
,
he
would
have
been
treated
as
an
*NL*
enemy
.
In
this
light
are
personal
friendships
regarded
among
them
,
and
*NL*
the
individual
so
protected
is
said
to
be
`
taboo
'
,
and
his
person
,
to
a
*NL*
certain
extent
,
is
held
as
sacred
.
Thus
the
stranger
informed
me
he
had
*NL*
access
to
all
the
valleys
in
the
island
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curious
to
know
how
he
had
acquired
his
knowledge
of
English
,
I
*NL*
questioned
him
on
the
subject
.
At
first
,
for
some
reason
or
other
,
he
*NL*
evaded
the
inquiry
,
but
afterwards
told
me
that
,
when
a
boy
,
he
had
*NL*
been
carried
to
sea
by
the
captain
of
a
trading
vessel
,
with
whom
he
*NL*
had
stayed
three
years
,
living
part
of
the
time
with
him
at
Sidney
in
*NL*
Australia
,
and
that
at
a
subsequent
visit
to
the
island
,
the
captain
*NL*
had
,
at
his
own
request
,
permitted
him
to
remain
among
his
countrymen
.
*NL*
The
natural
quickness
of
the
savage
had
been
wonderfully
improved
by
his
*NL*
intercourse
with
the
white
men
,
and
his
partial
knowledge
of
a
foreign
*NL*
language
gave
him
a
great
ascendancy
over
his
less
accomplished
*NL*
countrymen
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
asked
the
now
affable
Marnoo
why
it
was
that
he
had
not
*NL*
previously
spoken
to
me
,
he
eagerly
inquired
what
I
had
been
led
to
*NL*
think
of
him
from
his
conduct
in
that
respect
.
I
replied
,
that
I
had
*NL*
supposed
him
to
be
some
great
chief
or
warrior
,
who
had
seen
plenty
*NL*
of
white
men
before
,
and
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
notice
a
poor
*NL*
sailor
.
At
this
declaration
of
the
exalted
opinion
I
had
formed
of
him
,
*NL*
he
appeared
vastly
gratified
,
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
he
had
*NL*
purposely
behaved
in
that
manner
,
in
order
to
increase
my
astonishment
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
he
should
see
proper
to
address
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marnoo
now
sought
to
learn
my
version
of
the
story
as
to
how
I
came
*NL*
to
be
an
inmate
of
the
Typee
valley
.
When
I
related
to
him
the
*NL*
circumstances
under
which
Toby
and
I
had
entered
it
,
he
listened
*NL*
with
evident
interest
;
but
as
soon
as
I
alluded
to
the
absence
,
yet
*NL*
unaccounted
for
,
of
my
comrade
,
he
endeavoured
to
change
the
subject
,
as
*NL*
if
it
were
something
he
desired
not
to
agitate
.
It
seemed
,
indeed
,
as
*NL*
if
everything
connected
with
Toby
was
destined
to
beget
distrust
and
*NL*
anxiety
in
my
bosom
.
Notwithstanding
Marnoo
's
denial
of
any
knowledge
*NL*
of
his
fate
,
I
could
not
avoid
suspecting
that
he
was
deceiving
me
;
and
*NL*
this
suspicion
revived
those
frightful
apprehensions
with
regard
to
my
*NL*
own
fate
,
which
,
for
a
short
time
past
,
had
subsided
in
my
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Influenced
by
these
feelings
,
I
now
felt
a
strong
desire
to
avail
myself
*NL*
of
the
stranger
's
protection
,
and
under
his
safeguard
to
return
to
*NL*
Nukuheva
.
But
as
soon
as
I
hinted
at
this
,
he
unhesitatingly
pronounced
*NL*
it
to
be
entirely
impracticable
;
assuring
me
that
the
Typees
would
never
*NL*
consent
to
my
leaving
the
valley
.
Although
what
he
said
merely
confirmed
*NL*
the
impression
which
I
had
before
entertained
,
still
it
increased
*NL*
my
anxiety
to
escape
from
a
captivity
which
,
however
endurable
,
nay
,
*NL*
delightful
it
might
be
in
some
respects
,
involved
in
its
issues
a
fate
*NL*
marked
by
the
most
frightful
contingencies
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
could
not
conceal
from
my
mind
that
Toby
had
been
treated
in
the
same
*NL*
friendly
manner
as
I
had
been
,
and
yet
all
their
kindness
terminated
*NL*
with
his
mysterious
disappearance
.
Might
not
the
same
fate
await
me
?
--
a
*NL*
fate
too
dreadful
to
think
of
.
Stimulated
by
these
considerations
,
*NL*
I
urged
anew
my
request
to
Marnoo
;
but
he
only
set
forth
in
stronger
*NL*
colours
the
impossibility
of
my
escape
,
and
repeated
his
previous
*NL*
declaration
that
the
Typees
would
never
be
brought
to
consent
to
my
*NL*
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
endeavoured
to
learn
from
him
the
motives
which
prompted
them
to
*NL*
hold
me
a
prisoner
,
Marnoo
again
presumed
that
mysterious
tone
which
had
*NL*
tormented
me
with
apprehension
when
I
had
questioned
him
with
regard
to
*NL*
the
fate
of
my
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
repulsed
,
in
a
manner
which
only
served
,
by
arousing
the
most
*NL*
dreadful
forebodings
,
to
excite
me
to
renewed
attempts
,
I
conjured
him
*NL*
to
intercede
for
me
with
the
natives
,
and
endeavour
to
procure
their
*NL*
consent
to
my
leaving
them
.
To
this
he
appeared
strongly
averse
;
but
,
*NL*
yielding
at
last
to
my
importunities
,
he
addressed
several
of
the
*NL*
chiefs
,
who
with
the
rest
had
been
eyeing
us
intently
during
the
whole
*NL*
of
our
conversation
.
His
petition
,
however
,
was
at
once
met
with
the
*NL*
most
violent
disapprobation
,
manifesting
itself
in
angry
glances
and
*NL*
gestures
,
and
a
perfect
torrent
of
passionate
words
,
directed
to
both
*NL*
him
and
myself
.
Marnoo
,
evidently
repenting
the
step
he
had
taken
,
*NL*
earnestly
deprecated
the
resentment
of
the
crowd
,
and
,
in
a
few
moments
*NL*
succeeded
in
pacifying
to
some
extent
the
clamours
which
had
broken
out
*NL*
as
soon
as
his
proposition
had
been
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
most
intense
interest
had
I
watched
the
reception
his
*NL*
intercession
might
receive
;
and
a
bitter
pang
shot
through
my
heart
*NL*
at
the
additional
evidence
,
now
furnished
,
of
the
unchangeable
*NL*
determination
of
the
islanders
.
Marnoo
told
me
with
evident
alarm
in
his
*NL*
countenance
,
that
although
admitted
into
the
bay
on
a
friendly
footing
*NL*
with
its
inhabitants
,
he
could
not
presume
to
meddle
with
their
*NL*
concerns
,
as
such
procedure
,
if
persisted
in
,
would
at
once
absolve
*NL*
the
Typees
from
the
restraints
of
the
`
taboo
'
,
although
so
long
as
*NL*
he
refrained
from
such
conduct
,
it
screened
him
effectually
from
the
*NL*
consequences
of
the
enmity
they
bore
his
tribe
.
At
this
moment
,
Mehevi
,
*NL*
who
was
present
,
angrily
interrupted
him
;
and
the
words
which
he
uttered
*NL*
in
a
commanding
tone
,
evidently
meant
that
he
must
at
once
cease
talking
*NL*
to
me
and
withdraw
to
the
other
part
of
the
house
.
Marnoo
immediately
*NL*
started
up
,
hurriedly
enjoining
me
not
to
address
him
again
,
and
as
I
*NL*
valued
my
safety
,
to
refrain
from
all
further
allusion
to
the
subject
of
*NL*
my
departure
;
and
then
,
in
compliance
with
the
order
of
the
determined
*NL*
chief
,
but
not
before
it
had
again
been
angrily
repeated
,
he
withdrew
to
*NL*
a
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
now
perceived
,
with
no
small
degree
of
apprehension
,
the
same
savage
*NL*
expression
in
the
countenances
of
the
natives
,
which
had
startled
me
*NL*
during
the
scene
at
the
Ti
.
They
glanced
their
eyes
suspiciously
from
*NL*
Marnoo
to
me
,
as
if
distrusting
the
nature
of
an
intercourse
carried
on
,
*NL*
as
it
was
,
in
a
language
they
could
not
understand
,
and
they
seemed
to
*NL*
harbour
the
belief
that
already
we
had
concerted
measures
calculated
to
*NL*
elude
their
vigilance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lively
countenances
of
these
people
are
wonderfully
indicative
of
*NL*
the
emotions
of
the
soul
,
and
the
imperfections
of
their
oral
language
*NL*
are
more
than
compensated
for
by
the
nervous
eloquence
of
their
looks
*NL*
and
gestures
.
I
could
plainly
trace
,
in
every
varying
expression
of
*NL*
their
faces
,
all
those
passions
which
had
been
thus
unexpectedly
aroused
*NL*
in
their
bosoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
required
no
reflection
to
convince
me
,
from
what
was
going
on
,
that
*NL*
the
injunction
of
Marnoo
was
not
to
be
rashly
slighted
;
and
accordingly
,
*NL*
great
as
was
the
effort
to
suppress
my
feelings
,
I
accosted
Mehevi
in
*NL*
a
good-humoured
tone
,
with
a
view
of
dissipating
any
ill
impression
*NL*
he
might
have
received
.
But
the
ireful
,
angry
chief
was
not
so
easily
*NL*
mollified
.
He
rejected
my
advances
with
that
peculiarly
stern
expression
*NL*
I
have
before
described
,
and
took
care
by
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
*NL*
towards
me
to
show
the
displeasure
and
resentment
which
he
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marnoo
,
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
house
,
apparently
desirous
of
*NL*
making
a
diversion
in
my
favour
,
exerted
himself
to
amuse
with
his
*NL*
pleasantries
the
crowd
about
him
;
but
his
lively
attempts
were
not
so
*NL*
successful
as
they
had
previously
been
,
and
,
foiled
in
his
efforts
,
he
*NL*
rose
gravely
to
depart
.
No
one
expressed
any
regret
at
this
movement
,
*NL*
so
seizing
his
roll
of
tappa
,
and
grasping
his
spear
,
he
advanced
to
*NL*
the
front
of
the
pi-pi
,
and
waving
his
hand
in
adieu
to
the
now
silent
*NL*
throng
,
cast
upon
me
a
glance
of
mingled
pity
and
reproach
,
and
flung
*NL*
himself
into
the
path
which
led
from
the
house
.
I
watched
his
receding
*NL*
figure
until
it
was
lost
in
the
obscurity
of
the
grove
,
and
then
gave
*NL*
myself
up
to
the
most
desponding
reflections
.

CHAPTER
NINETEEN
*NL*
*NL*
REFLECTIONS
AFTER
MARNOO
'S
DEPARTURE-BATTLE
OF
THE
POP-GUNS
--
STRANGE
*NL*
CONCEIT
OF
MARHEYO
--
PROCESS
OF
MAKING
TAPPA
*NL*
*NL*
THE
knowledge
I
had
now
obtained
as
to
the
intention
of
the
savages
*NL*
deeply
affected
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marnoo
,
I
perceived
,
was
a
man
who
,
by
reason
of
his
superior
*NL*
acquirements
,
and
the
knowledge
he
possessed
of
the
events
which
were
*NL*
taking
place
in
the
different
bays
of
the
island
,
was
held
in
no
little
*NL*
estimation
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
.
He
had
been
received
with
*NL*
the
most
cordial
welcome
and
respect
.
The
natives
had
hung
upon
the
*NL*
accents
of
his
voice
,
and
,
had
manifested
the
highest
gratification
at
*NL*
being
individually
noticed
by
him
.
And
yet
despite
all
this
,
a
few
*NL*
words
urged
in
my
behalf
,
with
the
intent
of
obtaining
my
release
from
*NL*
captivity
,
had
sufficed
not
only
to
banish
all
harmony
and
good-will
;
*NL*
but
,
if
I
could
believe
what
he
told
me
,
had
gone
on
to
endanger
his
own
*NL*
personal
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
strongly
rooted
,
then
,
must
be
the
determination
of
the
Typees
*NL*
with
regard
to
me
,
and
how
suddenly
could
they
display
the
strangest
*NL*
passions
!
The
mere
suggestion
of
my
departure
had
estranged
from
me
,
*NL*
for
the
time
at
least
,
Mehevi
,
who
was
the
most
influential
of
all
*NL*
the
chiefs
,
and
who
had
previously
exhibited
so
many
instances
of
his
*NL*
friendly
sentiments
.
The
rest
of
the
natives
had
likewise
evinced
their
*NL*
strong
repugnance
to
my
wishes
,
and
even
Kory-Kory
himself
seemed
to
*NL*
share
in
the
general
disapprobation
bestowed
upon
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
I
racked
my
invention
to
find
out
some
motive
for
them
,
but
I
*NL*
could
discover
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
however
this
might
be
,
the
scene
which
had
just
occurred
admonished
*NL*
me
of
the
danger
of
trifling
with
the
wayward
and
passionate
spirits
*NL*
against
whom
it
was
vain
to
struggle
,
and
might
even
be
fatal
to
do
go
.
*NL*
My
only
hope
was
to
induce
the
natives
to
believe
that
I
was
reconciled
*NL*
to
my
detention
in
the
valley
,
and
by
assuming
a
tranquil
and
cheerful
*NL*
demeanour
,
to
allay
the
suspicions
which
I
had
so
unfortunately
aroused
.
*NL*
Their
confidence
revived
,
they
might
in
a
short
time
remit
in
some
*NL*
degree
their
watchfulness
over
my
movements
,
and
I
should
then
be
the
*NL*
better
enabled
to
avail
myself
of
any
opportunity
which
presented
itself
*NL*
for
escape
.
I
determined
,
therefore
,
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
*NL*
bargain
,
and
to
bear
up
manfully
against
whatever
might
betide
.
In
this
*NL*
endeavour
,
I
succeeded
beyond
my
own
expectations
.
At
the
period
*NL*
of
Marnoo
's
visit
,
I
had
been
in
the
valley
,
as
nearly
as
I
could
*NL*
conjecture
,
some
two
months
.
Although
not
completely
recovered
from
my
*NL*
strange
illness
,
which
still
lingered
about
me
,
I
was
free
from
pain
*NL*
and
able
to
take
exercise
.
In
short
,
I
had
every
reason
to
anticipate
a
*NL*
perfect
recovery
.
Freed
from
apprehension
on
this
point
,
and
resolved
*NL*
to
regard
the
future
without
flinching
,
I
flung
myself
anew
into
all
the
*NL*
social
pleasures
of
the
valley
,
and
sought
to
bury
all
regrets
,
and
*NL*
all
remembrances
of
my
previous
existence
in
the
wild
enjoyments
it
*NL*
afforded
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
my
various
wanderings
through
the
vale
,
and
as
I
became
better
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
character
of
its
inhabitants
,
I
was
more
and
more
*NL*
struck
with
the
light-hearted
joyousness
that
everywhere
prevailed
.
The
*NL*
minds
of
these
simple
savages
,
unoccupied
by
matters
of
graver
moment
,
*NL*
were
capable
of
deriving
the
utmost
delight
from
circumstances
which
*NL*
would
have
passed
unnoticed
in
more
intelligent
communities
.
All
their
*NL*
enjoyment
,
indeed
,
seemed
to
be
made
up
of
the
little
trifling
incidents
*NL*
of
the
passing
hour
;
but
these
diminutive
items
swelled
altogether
to
an
*NL*
amount
of
happiness
seldom
experienced
by
more
enlightened
individuals
,
*NL*
whose
pleasures
are
drawn
from
more
elevated
but
rarer
sources
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
community
,
for
instance
,
of
refined
and
intellectual
mortals
*NL*
would
derive
the
least
satisfaction
from
shooting
pop-guns
?
The
*NL*
mere
supposition
of
such
a
thing
being
possible
would
excite
their
*NL*
indignation
,
and
yet
the
whole
population
of
Typee
did
little
else
for
*NL*
ten
days
but
occupy
themselves
with
that
childish
amusement
,
fairly
*NL*
screaming
,
too
,
with
the
delight
it
afforded
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
I
was
frolicking
with
a
little
spirited
urchin
,
some
six
years
*NL*
old
,
who
chased
me
with
a
piece
of
bamboo
about
three
feet
long
,
with
*NL*
which
he
occasionally
belaboured
me
.
Seizing
the
stick
from
him
,
the
*NL*
idea
happened
to
suggest
itself
,
that
I
might
make
for
the
youngster
,
*NL*
out
of
the
slender
tube
,
one
of
those
nursery
muskets
with
which
I
had
*NL*
sometimes
seen
children
playing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
with
my
knife
I
made
two
parallel
slits
in
the
cane
several
*NL*
inches
in
length
,
and
cutting
loose
at
one
end
the
elastic
strip
between
*NL*
them
,
bent
it
back
and
slipped
the
point
into
a
little
notch
made
for
*NL*
the
purse
.
Any
small
substance
placed
against
this
would
be
projected
*NL*
with
considerable
force
through
the
tube
,
by
merely
springing
the
bent
*NL*
strip
out
of
the
notch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
I
possessed
the
remotest
idea
of
the
sensation
this
piece
of
*NL*
ordnance
was
destined
to
produce
,
I
should
certainly
have
taken
out
a
*NL*
patent
for
the
invention
.
The
boy
scampered
away
with
it
,
half
delirious
*NL*
with
ecstasy
,
and
in
twenty
minutes
afterwards
I
might
have
been
seen
*NL*
surrounded
by
a
noisy
crowd
--
venerable
old
graybeards
--
responsible
*NL*
fathers
of
families
--
valiant
warriors
--
matrons
--
young
men
--
girls
and
*NL*
children
,
all
holding
in
their
hands
bits
of
bamboo
,
and
each
clamouring
*NL*
to
be
served
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
three
or
four
hours
I
was
engaged
in
manufacturing
pop-guns
,
but
*NL*
at
last
made
over
my
good-will
and
interest
in
the
concern
to
a
lad
of
*NL*
remarkably
quick
parts
,
whom
I
soon
initiated
into
the
art
and
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pop
,
Pop
,
Pop
,
Pop
,
now
resounded
all
over
the
valley
.
Duels
,
*NL*
skirmishes
,
pitched
battles
,
and
general
engagements
were
to
be
seen
*NL*
on
every
side
.
Here
,
as
you
walked
along
a
path
which
led
through
a
*NL*
thicket
,
you
fell
into
a
cunningly
laid
ambush
,
and
became
a
target
for
*NL*
a
body
of
musketeers
whose
tattooed
limbs
you
could
just
see
peeping
*NL*
into
view
through
the
foliage
.
There
you
were
assailed
by
the
intrepid
*NL*
garrison
of
a
house
,
who
levelled
their
bamboo
rifles
at
you
from
*NL*
between
the
upright
canes
which
composed
its
sides
.
Farther
on
you
were
*NL*
fired
upon
by
a
detachment
of
sharpshooters
,
mounted
upon
the
top
of
a
*NL*
pi-pi
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pop
,
Pop
,
Pop
,
Pop
!
green
guavas
,
seeds
,
and
berries
were
flying
about
*NL*
in
every
direction
,
and
during
this
dangerous
state
of
affairs
I
was
*NL*
half
afraid
that
,
like
the
man
and
his
brazen
bull
,
I
should
fall
*NL*
a
victim
to
my
own
ingenuity
.
Like
everything
else
,
however
,
the
*NL*
excitement
gradually
wore
away
,
though
ever
after
occasionally
pop-guns
*NL*
might
be
heard
at
all
hours
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
towards
the
close
of
the
pop-gun
war
,
that
I
was
infinitely
*NL*
diverted
with
a
strange
freak
of
Marheyo
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
worn
,
when
I
quitted
the
ship
,
a
pair
of
thick
pumps
,
which
,
from
*NL*
the
rough
usage
they
had
received
in
scaling
precipices
and
sliding
down
*NL*
gorges
,
were
so
dilapidated
as
to
be
altogether
unfit
for
use
--
so
,
at
*NL*
least
,
would
have
thought
the
generality
of
people
,
and
so
they
most
*NL*
certainly
were
,
when
considered
in
the
light
of
shoes
.
But
things
*NL*
unservicable
in
one
way
,
may
with
advantage
be
applied
in
another
,
*NL*
that
is
,
if
one
have
genius
enough
for
the
purpose
.
This
genius
Marheyo
*NL*
possessed
in
a
superlative
degree
,
as
he
abundantly
evinced
by
the
use
*NL*
to
which
he
put
those
sorely
bruised
and
battered
old
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
article
,
however
trivial
,
which
belonged
to
me
,
the
natives
*NL*
appeared
to
regard
as
sacred
;
and
I
observed
that
for
several
days
*NL*
after
becoming
an
inmate
of
the
house
,
my
pumps
were
suffered
to
remain
,
*NL*
untouched
,
where
I
had
first
happened
to
throw
them
.
I
remembered
,
*NL*
however
,
that
after
awhile
I
had
missed
them
from
their
accustomed
*NL*
place
;
but
the
matter
gave
me
no
concern
,
supposing
that
Tinor
--
like
any
*NL*
other
tidy
housewife
,
having
come
across
them
in
some
of
her
domestic
*NL*
occupations
--
had
pitched
the
useless
things
out
of
the
house
.
But
I
was
*NL*
soon
undeceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
I
observed
old
Marheyo
bustling
about
me
with
unusual
activity
,
*NL*
and
to
such
a
degree
as
almost
to
supersede
Kory-Kory
in
the
functions
*NL*
of
his
office
.
One
moment
he
volunteered
to
trot
off
with
me
on
his
back
*NL*
to
the
stream
;
and
when
I
refused
,
noways
daunted
by
the
repulse
,
he
*NL*
continued
to
frisk
about
me
like
a
superannuated
house-dog
.
I
could
not
*NL*
for
the
life
of
me
conjecture
what
possessed
the
old
gentleman
,
until
*NL*
all
at
once
,
availing
himself
of
the
temporary
absence
of
the
household
,
*NL*
he
went
through
a
variety
of
of
uncouth
gestures
,
pointing
eagerly
down
*NL*
to
my
feet
,
then
up
to
a
little
bundle
,
which
swung
from
the
ridge
pole
*NL*
overhead
.
At
last
I
caught
a
faint
idea
of
his
meaning
,
and
motioned
him
*NL*
to
lower
the
package
.
He
executed
the
order
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
*NL*
and
unrolling
a
piece
of
tappa
,
displayed
to
my
astonished
gaze
the
*NL*
identical
pumps
which
I
thought
had
been
destroyed
long
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
immediately
comprehended
his
desire
,
and
very
generously
gave
him
the
*NL*
shoes
,
which
had
become
quite
mouldy
,
wondering
for
what
earthly
purpose
*NL*
he
could
want
them
.
The
same
afternoon
I
descried
the
venerable
warrior
*NL*
approaching
the
house
,
with
a
slow
,
stately
gait
,
ear-rings
in
ears
,
and
*NL*
spear
in
hand
,
with
this
highly
ornamental
pair
of
shoes
suspended
from
*NL*
his
neck
by
a
strip
of
bark
,
and
swinging
backwards
and
forwards
on
*NL*
his
capacious
chest
.
In
the
gala
costume
of
the
tasteful
Marheyo
,
these
*NL*
calf-skin
pendants
ever
after
formed
the
most
striking
feature
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
turn
to
something
a
little
more
important
.
Although
the
whole
*NL*
existence
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
seemed
to
pass
away
exempt
*NL*
from
toil
,
yet
there
were
some
light
employments
which
,
although
amusing
*NL*
rather
than
laborious
as
occupations
,
contributed
to
their
comfort
and
*NL*
luxury
.
Among
these
the
most
important
was
the
manufacture
of
the
native
*NL*
cloth
,
--
`
tappa
'
,
--
so
well
known
,
under
various
modifications
,
throughout
*NL*
the
whole
Polynesian
Archipelago
.
As
is
generally
understood
,
this
*NL*
useful
and
sometimes
elegant
article
is
fabricated
from
the
bark
*NL*
of
different
trees
.
But
,
as
I
believe
that
no
description
of
its
*NL*
manufacture
has
ever
been
given
,
I
shall
state
what
I
know
regarding
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
manufacture
of
the
beautiful
white
tappa
generally
worn
on
the
*NL*
Marquesan
Islands
,
the
preliminary
operation
consists
in
gathering
a
*NL*
certain
quantity
of
the
young
branches
of
the
cloth-tree
.
The
exterior
*NL*
green
bark
being
pulled
off
as
worthless
,
there
remains
a
slender
*NL*
fibrous
substance
,
which
is
carefully
stripped
from
the
stick
,
to
which
*NL*
it
closely
adheres
.
When
a
sufficient
quantity
of
it
has
been
collected
,
*NL*
the
various
strips
are
enveloped
in
a
covering
of
large
leaves
,
which
*NL*
the
natives
use
precisely
as
we
do
wrapping-paper
,
and
which
are
secured
*NL*
by
a
few
turns
of
a
line
passed
round
them
.
The
package
is
then
laid
in
*NL*
the
bed
of
some
running
stream
,
with
a
heavy
stone
placed
over
it
,
to
*NL*
prevent
its
being
swept
away
.
After
it
has
remained
for
two
or
three
*NL*
days
in
this
state
,
it
is
drawn
out
,
and
exposed
,
for
a
short
time
,
to
*NL*
the
action
of
the
air
,
every
distinct
piece
being
attentively
inspected
,
*NL*
with
a
view
of
ascertaining
whether
it
has
yet
been
sufficiently
*NL*
affected
by
the
operation
.
This
is
repeated
again
and
again
,
until
the
*NL*
desired
result
is
obtained
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
substance
is
in
a
proper
state
for
the
next
process
,
it
*NL*
betrays
evidences
of
incipient
decomposition
;
the
fibres
are
relaxed
and
*NL*
softened
,
and
rendered
perfectly
malleable
.
The
different
strips
are
*NL*
now
extended
,
one
by
one
,
in
successive
layers
,
upon
some
smooth
*NL*
surface
--
generally
the
prostrate
trunk
of
a
cocoanut
tree
--
and
the
heap
*NL*
thus
formed
is
subjected
,
at
every
new
increase
,
to
a
moderate
beating
,
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
wooden
mallet
,
leisurely
applied
.
The
mallet
is
made
of
a
*NL*
hard
heavy
wood
resembling
ebony
,
is
about
twelve
inches
in
length
,
and
*NL*
perhaps
two
in
breadth
,
with
a
rounded
handle
at
one
end
,
and
in
shape
*NL*
is
the
exact
counterpart
of
one
of
our
four-sided
razor-strops
.
The
flat
*NL*
surfaces
of
the
implement
are
marked
with
shallow
parallel
indentations
,
*NL*
varying
in
depth
on
the
different
sides
,
so
as
to
be
adapted
to
the
*NL*
several
stages
of
the
operation
.
These
marks
produce
the
corduroy
sort
*NL*
of
stripes
discernible
in
the
tappa
in
its
finished
state
.
After
being
*NL*
beaten
in
the
manner
I
have
described
,
the
material
soon
becomes
blended
*NL*
in
one
mass
,
which
,
moistened
occasionally
with
water
,
is
at
intervals
*NL*
hammered
out
,
by
a
kind
of
gold-beating
process
,
to
any
degree
of
*NL*
thinness
required
.
In
this
way
the
cloth
is
easily
made
to
vary
in
*NL*
strength
and
thickness
,
so
as
to
suit
the
numerous
purposes
to
which
it
*NL*
is
applied
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
operation
last
described
has
been
concluded
,
the
new-made
tappa
*NL*
is
spread
out
on
the
grass
to
bleach
and
dry
,
and
soon
becomes
of
a
*NL*
dazzling
whiteness
.
Sometimes
,
in
the
first
stages
of
the
manufacture
,
*NL*
the
substance
is
impregnated
with
a
vegetable
juice
,
which
gives
it
*NL*
a
permanent
colour
.
A
rich
brown
and
a
bright
yellow
are
occasionally
*NL*
seen
,
but
the
simple
taste
of
the
Typee
people
inclines
them
to
prefer
*NL*
the
natural
tint
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
notable
wife
of
Kamehameha
,
the
renowned
conqueror
and
king
of
the
*NL*
Sandwich
Islands
,
used
to
pride
herself
in
the
skill
she
displayed
in
*NL*
dyeing
her
tappa
with
contrasting
colours
disposed
in
regular
figures
;
*NL*
and
,
in
the
midst
of
the
innovations
of
the
times
,
was
regarded
,
towards
*NL*
the
decline
of
her
life
,
as
a
lady
of
the
old
school
,
clinging
as
she
*NL*
did
to
the
national
cloth
,
in
preference
to
the
frippery
of
the
*NL*
European
calicoes
.
But
the
art
of
printing
the
tappa
is
unknown
upon
the
*NL*
Marquesan
Islands
.
In
passing
along
the
valley
,
I
was
often
attracted
by
*NL*
the
noise
of
the
mallet
,
which
,
when
employed
in
the
manufacture
of
*NL*
the
cloth
produces
at
every
stroke
of
its
hard
,
heavy
wood
,
a
clear
,
*NL*
ringing
,
and
musical
sound
,
capable
of
being
heard
at
a
great
distance
.
*NL*
When
several
of
these
implements
happen
to
be
in
operation
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
near
one
another
,
the
effect
upon
the
ear
of
a
person
,
at
a
little
*NL*
distance
,
is
really
charming
.

CHAPTER
TWENTY
*NL*
*NL*
HISTORY
OF
A
DAY
AS
USUALLY
SPENT
IN
TYPEE
VALLEY
--
DANCES
OF
THE
*NL*
MARQUESAN
GIRLS
*NL*
*NL*
NOTHING
can
be
more
uniform
and
undiversified
than
the
life
of
the
*NL*
Typees
;
one
tranquil
day
of
ease
and
happiness
follows
another
in
quiet
*NL*
succession
;
and
with
these
unsophisicated
savages
the
history
of
a
*NL*
day
is
the
history
of
a
life
.
I
will
,
therefore
,
as
briefly
as
I
can
,
*NL*
describe
one
of
our
days
in
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
begin
with
the
morning
.
We
were
not
very
early
risers
--
the
sun
would
*NL*
be
shooting
his
golden
spikes
above
the
Happar
mountain
,
ere
I
threw
*NL*
aside
my
tappa
robe
,
and
girding
my
long
tunic
about
my
waist
,
sallied
*NL*
out
with
Fayaway
and
Kory-Kory
,
and
the
rest
of
the
household
,
and
bent
*NL*
my
steps
towards
the
stream
.
Here
we
found
congregated
all
those
who
*NL*
dwelt
in
our
section
of
the
valley
;
and
here
we
bathed
with
them
.
The
*NL*
fresh
morning
air
and
the
cool
flowing
waters
put
both
soul
and
body
in
*NL*
a
glow
,
and
after
a
half-hour
employed
in
this
recreation
,
we
sauntered
*NL*
back
to
the
house
--
Tinor
and
Marheyo
gathering
dry
sticks
by
the
way
*NL*
for
fire-wood
;
some
of
the
young
men
laying
the
cocoanut
trees
under
*NL*
contribution
as
they
passed
beneath
them
;
while
Kory-Kory
played
his
*NL*
outlandish
pranks
for
my
particular
diversion
,
and
Fayaway
and
I
,
not
*NL*
arm
in
arm
to
be
sure
,
but
sometimes
hand
in
hand
,
strolled
along
,
with
*NL*
feelings
of
perfect
charity
for
all
the
world
,
and
especial
good-will
*NL*
towards
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
morning
meal
was
soon
prepared
.
The
islanders
are
somewhat
*NL*
abstemious
at
this
repast
;
reserving
the
more
powerful
efforts
of
*NL*
their
appetite
to
a
later
period
of
the
day
.
For
my
own
part
,
with
the
*NL*
assistance
of
my
valet
,
who
,
as
I
have
before
stated
,
always
officiated
*NL*
as
spoon
on
these
occasions
,
I
ate
sparingly
from
one
of
Tinor
's
*NL*
trenchers
,
of
poee-poee
;
which
was
devoted
exclusively
for
my
own
use
,
*NL*
being
mixed
with
the
milky
meat
of
ripe
cocoanut
.
A
section
of
a
roasted
*NL*
bread-fruit
,
a
small
cake
of
`
Amar
'
,
or
a
mess
of
`
Cokoo
,
'
two
or
three
*NL*
bananas
,
or
a
mammee-apple
;
an
annuee
,
or
some
other
agreeable
and
*NL*
nutritious
fruit
served
from
day
to
day
to
diversify
the
meal
,
which
was
*NL*
finished
by
tossing
off
the
liquid
contents
of
a
young
cocoanut
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
partaking
of
this
simple
repast
,
the
inmates
of
Marheyo
's
house
,
*NL*
after
the
style
of
the
ancient
Romans
,
reclined
in
sociable
groups
upon
*NL*
the
divan
of
mats
,
and
digestion
was
promoted
by
cheerful
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
morning
meal
was
concluded
,
pipes
were
lighted
;
and
among
them
*NL*
my
own
especial
pipe
,
a
present
from
the
noble
Mehevi
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
islanders
,
who
only
smoke
a
whiff
or
two
at
a
time
,
and
at
long
*NL*
intervals
,
and
who
keep
their
pipes
going
from
hand
to
hand
continually
,
*NL*
regarded
my
systematic
smoking
of
four
or
five
pipefuls
of
tobacco
in
*NL*
succession
,
as
something
quite
wonderful
.
When
two
or
three
pipes
had
*NL*
circulated
freely
,
the
company
gradually
broke
up
.
Marheyo
went
to
the
*NL*
little
hut
he
was
forever
building
.
Tinor
began
to
inspect
her
rolls
of
*NL*
tappa
,
or
employed
her
busy
fingers
in
plaiting
grass-mats
.
The
girls
*NL*
anointed
themselves
with
their
fragrant
oils
,
dressed
their
hair
,
or
*NL*
looked
over
their
curious
finery
,
and
compared
together
their
ivory
*NL*
trinkets
,
fashioned
out
of
boar
's
tusks
or
whale
's
teeth
.
The
young
men
*NL*
and
warriors
produced
their
spears
,
paddles
,
canoe-gear
,
battle-clubs
,
*NL*
and
war-conchs
,
and
occupied
themselves
in
carving
,
all
sorts
of
figures
*NL*
upon
them
with
pointed
bits
of
shell
or
flint
,
and
adorning
them
,
*NL*
especially
the
war-conchs
,
with
tassels
of
braided
bark
and
tufts
of
*NL*
human
hair
.
Some
,
immediately
after
eating
,
threw
themselves
once
more
*NL*
upon
the
inviting
mats
,
and
resumed
the
employment
of
the
previous
*NL*
night
,
sleeping
as
soundly
as
if
they
had
not
closed
their
eyes
for
a
*NL*
week
.
Others
sallied
out
into
the
groves
,
for
the
purpose
of
gathering
*NL*
fruit
or
fibres
of
bark
and
leaves
;
the
last
two
being
in
constant
*NL*
requisition
,
and
applied
to
a
hundred
uses
.
A
few
,
perhaps
,
among
the
*NL*
girls
,
would
slip
into
the
woods
after
flowers
,
or
repair
to
the
stream
*NL*
will
;
small
calabashes
and
cocoanut
shells
,
in
order
to
polish
them
*NL*
by
friction
with
a
smooth
stone
in
the
water
.
In
truth
these
innocent
*NL*
people
seemed
to
be
at
no
loss
for
something
to
occupy
their
time
;
and
*NL*
it
would
be
no
light
task
to
enumerate
all
their
employments
,
or
rather
*NL*
pleasures
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
own
mornings
I
spent
in
a
variety
of
ways
.
Sometimes
I
rambled
about
*NL*
from
house
to
house
,
sure
of
receiving
a
cordial
welcome
wherever
I
*NL*
went
;
or
from
grove
to
grove
,
and
from
one
shady
place
to
another
,
in
*NL*
company
with
Kory-Kory
and
Fayaway
,
and
a
rabble
rout
of
merry
young
*NL*
idlers
.
Sometimes
I
was
too
indolent
for
exercise
,
and
accepting
one
of
*NL*
the
many
invitations
I
was
continually
receiving
,
stretched
myself
out
*NL*
on
the
mats
of
some
hospitable
dwelling
,
and
occupied
myself
pleasantly
*NL*
either
in
watching
the
proceedings
of
those
around
me
or
taking
part
*NL*
in
them
myself
.
Whenever
I
chose
to
do
the
latter
,
the
delight
of
the
*NL*
islanders
was
boundless
;
and
there
was
always
a
throng
of
competitors
*NL*
for
the
honour
of
instructing
me
in
any
particular
craft
.
I
soon
became
*NL*
quite
an
accomplished
hand
at
making
tappa
--
could
braid
a
grass
sling
as
*NL*
well
as
the
best
of
them
--
and
once
,
with
my
knife
,
carved
the
handle
of
*NL*
a
javelin
so
exquisitely
,
that
I
have
no
doubt
,
to
this
day
,
Karnoonoo
,
*NL*
its
owner
,
preserves
it
as
a
surprising
specimen
of
my
skill
.
As
noon
*NL*
approached
,
all
those
who
had
wandered
forth
from
our
habitation
,
began
*NL*
to
return
;
and
when
midday
was
fairly
come
scarcely
a
sound
was
to
be
*NL*
heard
in
the
valley
:
a
deep
sleep
fell
upon
all
.
The
luxurious
siesta
*NL*
was
hardly
ever
omitted
,
except
by
old
Marheyo
,
who
was
so
eccentric
*NL*
a
character
,
that
he
seemed
to
be
governed
by
no
fixed
principles
*NL*
whatever
;
but
acting
just
according
to
the
humour
of
the
moment
,
*NL*
slept
,
ate
,
or
tinkered
away
at
his
little
hut
,
without
regard
to
the
*NL*
proprieties
of
time
or
place
.
Frequently
he
might
have
been
seen
taking
*NL*
a
nap
in
the
sun
at
noon-day
,
or
a
bath
in
the
stream
of
mid-night
.
*NL*
Once
I
beheld
him
perched
eighty
feet
from
the
ground
,
in
the
tuft
of
a
*NL*
cocoanut
tree
,
smoking
;
and
often
I
saw
him
standing
up
to
the
waist
*NL*
in
water
,
engaged
in
plucking
out
the
stray
hairs
of
his
beard
,
using
a
*NL*
piece
of
muscle-shell
for
tweezers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noon-tide
slumber
lasted
generally
an
hour
and
a
half
:
very
often
*NL*
longer
;
and
after
the
sleepers
had
arisen
from
their
mats
they
again
*NL*
had
recourse
to
their
pipes
,
and
then
made
preparations
for
the
most
*NL*
important
meal
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
,
however
,
like
those
gentlemen
of
leisure
who
breakfast
at
home
and
*NL*
dine
at
their
club
,
almost
invariably
,
during
my
intervals
of
health
,
*NL*
enjoyed
the
afternoon
repast
with
the
bachelor
chiefs
of
the
Ti
,
who
*NL*
were
always
rejoiced
to
see
me
,
and
lavishly
spread
before
me
all
the
*NL*
good
things
which
their
larder
afforded
.
Mehevi
generally
introduced
*NL*
among
other
dainties
a
baked
pig
,
an
article
which
I
have
every
reason
*NL*
to
suppose
was
provided
for
my
sole
gratification
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Ti
was
a
right
jovial
place
.
It
did
my
heart
,
as
well
as
my
body
,
*NL*
good
to
visit
it
.
Secure
from
female
intrusion
,
there
was
no
restraint
*NL*
upon
the
hilarity
of
the
warriors
,
who
,
like
the
gentlemen
of
Europe
*NL*
after
the
cloth
is
drawn
and
the
ladies
retire
,
freely
indulged
their
*NL*
mirth
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
spending
a
considerable
portion
of
the
afternoon
at
the
Ti
,
I
*NL*
usually
found
myself
,
as
the
cool
of
the
evening
came
on
,
either
sailing
*NL*
on
the
little
lake
with
Fayaway
,
or
bathing
in
the
waters
of
the
*NL*
stream
with
a
number
of
the
savages
,
who
,
at
this
hour
,
always
repaired
*NL*
thither
.
As
the
shadows
of
night
approached
Marheyo
's
household
were
*NL*
once
more
assembled
under
his
roof
:
tapers
were
lit
,
long
curious
chants
*NL*
were
raised
,
interminable
stories
were
told
-LRB-
for
which
one
present
was
*NL*
little
the
wiser
-RRB-
,
and
all
sorts
of
social
festivities
served
to
while
*NL*
away
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girls
very
often
danced
by
moonlight
in
front
of
their
*NL*
dwellings
.
There
are
a
great
variety
of
these
dances
,
in
which
,
however
,
*NL*
I
never
saw
the
men
take
part
.
They
all
consist
of
active
,
romping
,
*NL*
mischievous
evolutions
,
in
which
every
limb
is
brought
into
requisition
.
*NL*
Indeed
,
the
Marquesan
girls
dance
all
over
,
as
it
were
;
not
only
do
*NL*
their
feet
dance
,
but
their
arms
,
hands
,
fingers
,
ay
,
their
very
eyes
,
*NL*
seem
to
dance
in
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
damsels
wear
nothing
but
flowers
and
their
compendious
gala
tunics
;
*NL*
and
when
they
plume
themselves
for
the
dance
,
they
look
like
a
band
of
*NL*
olive-coloured
Sylphides
on
the
point
of
taking
wing
.
In
good
sooth
,
*NL*
they
so
sway
their
floating
forms
,
arch
their
necks
,
toss
aloft
their
*NL*
naked
arms
,
and
glide
,
and
swim
,
and
whirl
,
that
it
was
almost
too
much
*NL*
for
a
quiet
,
sober-minded
,
modest
young
man
like
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unless
some
particular
festivity
was
going
forward
,
the
inmates
of
*NL*
Marheyo
's
house
retired
to
their
mats
rather
early
in
the
evening
;
but
*NL*
not
for
the
night
,
since
,
after
slumbering
lightly
for
a
while
,
they
*NL*
rose
again
,
relit
their
tapers
,
partook
of
the
third
and
last
meal
of
*NL*
the
day
,
at
which
poee-poee
alone
was
eaten
,
and
then
,
after
inhaling
a
*NL*
narcotic
whiff
from
a
pipe
of
tobacco
,
disposed
themselves
for
the
great
*NL*
business
of
night
,
sleep
.
With
the
Marquesans
it
might
almost
most
be
*NL*
styled
the
great
business
of
life
,
for
they
pass
a
large
portion
*NL*
of
their
time
in
the
arms
of
Somnus
.
The
native
strength
of
their
*NL*
constitution
is
no
way
shown
more
emphatically
than
in
the
quantity
of
*NL*
sleep
they
can
endure
.
To
many
of
them
,
indeed
,
life
is
little
else
than
*NL*
an
often
interrupted
and
luxurious
nap
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
THE
SPRING
OF
ARVA
WAI
--
REMARKABLE
MONUMENTAL
REMAINS
--
SOME
IDEAS
WITH
*NL*
REGARD
TO
THE
HISTORY
OF
THE
PI-PIS
FOUND
IN
THE
VALLEY
*NL*
*NL*
ALMOST
every
country
has
its
medicinal
springs
famed
for
their
healing
*NL*
virtues
.
The
Cheltenham
of
Typee
is
embosomed
in
the
deepest
solitude
,
*NL*
and
but
seldom
receives
a
visitor
.
It
is
situated
remote
from
any
*NL*
dwelling
,
a
little
way
up
the
mountain
,
near
the
head
of
the
valley
;
and
*NL*
you
approach
it
by
a
pathway
shaded
by
the
most
beautiful
foliage
,
and
*NL*
adorned
with
a
thousand
fragrant
plants
.
The
mineral
waters
of
Arva
Wai
*
*NL*
ooze
forth
from
the
crevices
of
a
rock
,
and
gliding
down
its
mossy
side
,
*NL*
fall
at
last
,
in
many
clustering
drops
,
into
a
natural
basin
of
stone
*NL*
fringed
round
with
grass
and
dewy-looking
little
violet-coloured
*NL*
flowers
,
as
fresh
and
beautiful
as
the
perpetual
moisture
they
enjoy
can
*NL*
make
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
I
presume
this
might
be
translated
into
`
Strong
Waters
'
.
Arva
is
the
*NL*
name
bestowed
upon
a
root
the
properties
of
which
are
both
inebriating
*NL*
and
medicinal
.
`
Wai
'
is
the
Marquesan
word
for
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
is
held
in
high
estimation
by
the
islanders
,
some
of
whom
*NL*
consider
it
an
agreeable
as
well
as
a
medicinal
beverage
;
they
bring
it
*NL*
from
the
mountain
in
their
calabashes
,
and
store
it
away
beneath
heaps
*NL*
of
leaves
in
some
shady
nook
near
the
house
.
Old
Marheyo
had
a
great
*NL*
love
for
the
waters
of
the
spring
.
Every
now
and
then
he
lugged
off
to
*NL*
the
mountain
a
great
round
demijohn
of
a
calabash
,
and
,
panting
with
his
*NL*
exertions
,
brought
it
back
filled
with
his
darling
fluid
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
tasted
like
a
solution
of
a
dozen
disagreeable
things
,
and
was
*NL*
sufficiently
nauseous
to
have
made
the
fortune
of
the
proprietor
,
had
*NL*
the
spa
been
situated
in
the
midst
of
any
civilized
community
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
am
no
chemist
,
I
can
not
give
a
scientific
analysis
of
the
water
.
*NL*
All
I
know
about
the
matter
is
,
that
one
day
Marheyo
in
my
presence
*NL*
poured
out
the
last
drop
from
his
huge
calabash
,
and
I
observed
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
vessel
a
small
quantity
of
gravelly
sediment
very
much
*NL*
resembling
our
common
sand
.
Whether
this
is
always
found
in
the
water
,
*NL*
and
gives
it
its
peculiar
flavour
and
virtues
,
or
whether
its
presence
*NL*
was
merely
incidental
,
I
was
not
able
to
ascertain
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
in
returning
from
this
spring
by
a
circuitous
path
,
I
came
upon
*NL*
a
scene
which
reminded
me
of
Stonehenge
and
the
architectural
labours
of
*NL*
the
Druids
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
base
of
one
of
the
mountains
,
and
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
*NL*
dense
groves
,
a
series
of
vast
terraces
of
stone
rises
,
step
by
step
,
*NL*
for
a
considerable
distance
up
the
hill
side
.
These
terraces
can
not
*NL*
be
less
than
one
hundred
yards
in
length
and
twenty
in
width
.
Their
*NL*
magnitude
,
however
,
is
less
striking
than
the
immense
size
of
the
blocks
*NL*
composing
them
.
Some
of
the
stones
,
of
an
oblong
shape
,
are
from
ten
*NL*
to
fifteen
feet
in
length
,
and
five
or
six
feet
thick
.
Their
sides
are
*NL*
quite
smooth
,
but
though
square
,
and
of
pretty
regular
formation
,
they
*NL*
bear
no
mark
of
the
chisel
.
They
are
laid
together
without
cement
,
and
*NL*
here
and
there
show
gaps
between
.
The
topmost
terrace
and
the
lower
*NL*
one
are
somewhat
peculiar
in
their
construction
.
They
have
both
a
*NL*
quadrangular
depression
in
the
centre
,
leaving
the
rest
of
the
terrace
*NL*
elevated
several
feet
above
it
.
In
the
intervals
of
the
stones
immense
*NL*
trees
have
taken
root
,
and
their
broad
boughs
stretching
far
over
,
and
*NL*
interlacing
together
,
support
a
canopy
almost
impenetrable
to
the
sun
.
*NL*
Overgrowing
the
greater
part
of
them
,
and
climbing
from
one
to
another
,
*NL*
is
a
wilderness
of
vines
,
in
whose
sinewy
embrace
many
of
the
stones
*NL*
lie
half-hidden
,
while
in
some
places
a
thick
growth
of
bushes
entirely
*NL*
covers
them
.
There
is
a
wild
pathway
which
obliquely
crosses
two
of
*NL*
these
terraces
;
and
so
profound
is
the
shade
,
so
dense
the
vegetation
,
*NL*
that
a
stranger
to
the
place
might
pass
along
it
without
being
aware
of
*NL*
their
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
structures
bear
every
indication
of
a
very
high
antiquity
and
*NL*
Kory-Kory
,
who
was
my
authority
in
all
matters
of
scientific
research
,
*NL*
gave
me
to
understand
that
they
were
coeval
with
the
creation
of
the
*NL*
world
;
that
the
great
gods
themselves
were
the
builders
;
and
that
they
*NL*
would
endure
until
time
shall
be
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kory-Kory
's
prompt
explanation
and
his
attributing
the
work
to
a
*NL*
divine
origin
,
at
once
convinced
me
that
neither
he
nor
the
rest
of
his
*NL*
country-men
knew
anything
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
gazed
upon
this
monument
,
doubtless
the
work
of
an
extinct
and
*NL*
forgotten
race
,
thus
buried
in
the
green
nook
of
an
island
at
the
ends
*NL*
of
the
earth
,
the
existence
of
which
was
yesterday
unknown
,
a
stronger
*NL*
feeling
of
awe
came
over
me
than
if
I
had
stood
musing
at
the
mighty
*NL*
base
of
the
Pyramid
of
Cheops
.
There
are
no
inscriptions
,
no
sculpture
,
*NL*
no
clue
,
by
which
to
conjecture
its
history
;
nothing
but
the
dumb
*NL*
stones
.
How
many
generations
of
the
majestic
trees
which
overshadow
them
*NL*
have
grown
and
flourished
and
decayed
since
first
they
were
erected
!
*NL*
*NL*
These
remains
naturally
suggest
many
interesting
reflections
.
They
*NL*
establish
the
great
age
of
the
island
,
an
opinion
which
the
builders
*NL*
of
theories
concerning
,
the
creation
of
the
various
groups
in
the
South
*NL*
Seas
are
not
always
inclined
to
admit
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
think
it
*NL*
just
as
probable
that
human
beings
were
living
in
the
valleys
of
the
*NL*
Marquesas
three
thousand
years
ago
as
that
they
were
inhabiting
the
land
*NL*
of
Egypt
.
The
origin
of
the
island
of
Nukuheva
can
not
be
imputed
to
the
*NL*
coral
insect
;
for
indefatigable
as
that
wonderful
creature
is
,
it
would
*NL*
be
hardly
muscular
enough
to
pile
rocks
one
upon
the
other
more
than
*NL*
three
thousand
feet
above
the
level
of
the
sea
.
That
the
land
may
have
*NL*
been
thrown
up
by
a
submarine
volcano
is
as
possible
as
anything
else
.
*NL*
No
one
can
make
an
affidavit
to
the
contrary
,
and
therefore
I
still
say
*NL*
nothing
against
the
supposition
:
indeed
,
were
geologists
to
assert
that
*NL*
the
whole
continent
of
America
had
in
like
manner
been
formed
by
the
*NL*
simultaneous
explosion
of
a
train
of
Etnas
laid
under
the
water
all
the
*NL*
way
from
the
North
Pole
to
the
parallel
of
Cape
Horn
,
I
am
the
last
man
*NL*
in
the
world
to
contradict
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
already
mentioned
that
the
dwellings
of
the
islanders
were
almost
*NL*
invariably
built
upon
massive
stone
foundations
,
which
they
call
pi-pis
.
*NL*
The
dimensions
of
these
,
however
,
as
well
as
of
the
stones
composing
*NL*
them
,
are
comparatively
small
:
but
there
are
other
and
larger
erections
*NL*
of
a
similar
description
comprising
the
`
morais
'
,
or
burying
grounds
,
*NL*
and
festival-places
,
in
nearly
all
the
valleys
of
the
island
.
Some
of
*NL*
these
piles
are
so
extensive
,
and
so
great
a
degree
of
labour
and
skill
*NL*
must
have
been
requisite
in
constructing
them
,
that
I
can
scarcely
*NL*
believe
they
were
built
by
the
ancestors
of
the
present
inhabitants
.
If
*NL*
indeed
they
were
,
the
race
has
sadly
deteriorated
in
their
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
mechanic
arts
.
To
say
nothing
of
their
habitual
indolence
,
by
what
*NL*
contrivance
within
the
reach
of
so
simple
a
people
could
such
enormous
*NL*
masses
have
been
moved
or
fixed
in
their
places
?
and
how
could
they
with
*NL*
their
rude
implements
have
chiselled
and
hammered
them
into
shape
?
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
these
larger
pi-pis
--
like
that
of
the
Hoolah
Hoolah
ground
in
the
*NL*
Typee
valley
--
bore
incontestible
marks
of
great
age
;
and
I
am
disposed
*NL*
to
believe
that
their
erection
may
be
ascribed
to
the
same
race
of
men
*NL*
who
were
the
builders
of
the
still
more
ancient
remains
I
have
just
*NL*
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
Kory-Kory
's
account
,
the
pi-pi
upon
which
stands
the
Hoolah
*NL*
Hoolah
ground
was
built
a
great
many
moons
ago
,
under
the
direction
of
*NL*
Monoo
,
a
great
chief
and
warrior
,
and
,
as
it
would
appear
,
master-mason
*NL*
among
the
Typees
.
It
was
erected
for
the
express
purpose
to
which
it
is
*NL*
at
present
devoted
,
in
the
incredibly
short
period
of
one
sun
;
and
was
*NL*
dedicated
to
the
immortal
wooden
idols
by
a
grand
festival
,
which
lasted
*NL*
ten
days
and
nights
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
smaller
pi-pis
,
upon
which
stand
the
dwelling-houses
of
the
*NL*
natives
,
I
never
observed
any
which
intimated
a
recent
erection
.
There
*NL*
are
in
every
part
of
the
valley
a
great
many
of
these
massive
stone
*NL*
foundations
which
have
no
houses
upon
them
.
This
is
vastly
convenient
,
*NL*
for
whenever
an
enterprising
islander
chooses
to
emigrate
a
few
hundred
*NL*
yards
from
the
place
where
he
was
born
,
all
he
has
to
do
in
order
to
*NL*
establish
himself
in
some
new
locality
,
is
to
select
one
of
the
many
*NL*
unappropriated
pi-pis
,
and
without
further
ceremony
pitch
his
bamboo
*NL*
tent
upon
it
.

CHAPTER
TWENTY-TWO
*NL*
*NL*
PREPARATIONS
FOR
A
GRAND
FESTIVAL
IN
THE
VALLEY
--
STRANGE
DOINGS
IN
*NL*

OF

*NL*
DAMSELS
--
DEPARTURE
FOR
THE
FESTIVAL
*NL*
*NL*
FROM
the
time
that
my
lameness
had
decreased
I
had
made
a
daily
practice
*NL*
of
visiting
Mehevi
at
the
Ti
,
who
invariably
gave
me
a
most
cordial
*NL*
reception
.
I
was
always
accompanied
in
these
excursions
by
Fayaway
*NL*
and
the
ever-present
Kory-Kory
.
The
former
,
as
soon
as
we
reached
the
*NL*
vicinity
of
the
Ti
--
which
was
rigorously
tabooed
to
the
whole
female
*NL*
sex
--
withdrew
to
a
neighbouring
hut
,
as
if
her
feminine
delicacy
*NL*
`
restricted
'
her
from
approaching
a
habitation
which
might
be
regarded
*NL*
as
a
sort
of
Bachelor
's
Hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
good
truth
it
might
well
have
been
so
considered
.
Although
it
*NL*
was
the
permanent
residence
of
several
distinguished
chiefs
,
and
of
*NL*
the
noble
Mehevi
in
particular
,
it
was
still
at
certain
seasons
the
*NL*
favourite
haunt
of
all
the
jolly
,
talkative
,
and
elderly
savages
of
*NL*
the
vale
,
who
resorted
thither
in
the
same
way
that
similar
characters
*NL*
frequent
a
tavern
in
civilized
countries
.
There
they
would
remain
hour
*NL*
after
hour
,
chatting
,
smoking
,
eating
poee-poee
,
or
busily
engaged
in
*NL*
sleeping
for
the
good
of
their
constitutions
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
building
appeared
to
be
the
head-quarters
of
the
valley
,
where
all
*NL*
flying
rumours
concentrated
;
and
to
have
seen
it
filled
with
a
crowd
*NL*
of
the
natives
,
all
males
,
conversing
in
animated
clusters
,
while
*NL*
multitudes
were
continually
coming
and
going
,
one
would
have
thought
it
*NL*
a
kind
of
savage
Exchange
,
where
the
rise
and
fall
of
Polynesian
Stock
*NL*
was
discussed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mehevi
acted
as
supreme
lord
over
the
place
,
spending
the
greater
*NL*
portion
of
his
time
there
:
and
often
when
,
at
particular
hours
of
the
*NL*
day
,
it
was
deserted
by
nearly
every
one
else
except
the
verd-antique
*NL*
looking
centenarians
,
who
were
fixtures
in
the
building
,
the
chief
*NL*
himself
was
sure
to
be
found
enjoying
his
`
otium
cum
dignitate
'
--
upon
*NL*
the
luxurious
mats
which
covered
the
floor
.
Whenever
I
made
my
*NL*
appearance
he
invariably
rose
,
and
like
a
gentleman
doing
the
honours
of
*NL*
his
mansion
,
invited
me
to
repose
myself
wherever
I
pleased
,
and
calling
*NL*
out
`
tamaree
!
'
-LRB-
boy
-RRB-
,
a
little
fellow
would
appear
,
and
then
retiring
*NL*
for
an
instant
,
return
with
some
savoury
mess
,
from
which
the
chief
*NL*
would
press
me
to
regale
myself
.
To
tell
the
truth
,
Mehevi
was
indebted
*NL*
to
the
excellence
of
his
viands
for
the
honour
of
my
repeated
visits
--
a
*NL*
matter
which
can
not
appear
singular
,
when
it
is
borne
in
mind
that
*NL*
bachelors
,
all
the
world
over
,
are
famous
for
serving
up
unexceptionable
*NL*
repasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
on
drawing
near
to
the
Ti
,
I
observed
that
extensive
*NL*
preparations
were
going
forward
,
plainly
betokening
some
approaching
*NL*
festival
.
Some
of
the
symptoms
reminded
me
of
the
stir
produced
among
*NL*
the
scullions
of
a
large
hotel
,
where
a
grand
jubilee
dinner
is
about
to
*NL*
be
given
.
The
natives
were
hurrying
about
hither
and
thither
,
engaged
in
*NL*
various
duties
,
some
lugging
off
to
the
stream
enormous
hollow
*NL*
bamboos
,
for
the
purpose
of
filling
them
with
water
;
others
chasing
*NL*
furious-looking
hogs
through
the
bushes
,
in
their
endeavours
to
capture
*NL*
them
;
and
numbers
employed
in
kneading
great
mountains
of
poee-poee
*NL*
heaped
up
in
huge
wooden
vessels
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
observing
these
lively
indications
for
a
while
,
I
was
attracted
to
*NL*
a
neighbouring
grove
by
a
prodigious
squeaking
which
I
heard
there
.
On
*NL*
reaching
the
spot
I
found
it
proceeded
from
a
large
hog
which
a
number
*NL*
of
natives
were
forcibly
holding
to
the
earth
,
while
a
muscular
fellow
,
*NL*
armed
with
a
bludgeon
,
was
ineffectually
aiming
murderous
blows
at
the
*NL*
skull
of
the
unfortunate
porker
.
Again
and
again
he
missed
his
*NL*
writhing
and
struggling
victim
,
but
though
puffing
and
panting
with
*NL*
his
exertions
,
he
still
continued
them
;
and
after
striking
a
sufficient
*NL*
number
of
blows
to
have
demolished
an
entire
drove
of
oxen
,
with
one
*NL*
crashing
stroke
he
laid
him
dead
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
letting
any
blood
from
the
body
,
it
was
immediately
carried
to
a
*NL*
fire
which
had
been
kindled
near
at
hand
and
four
savages
taking
hold
of
*NL*
the
carcass
by
its
legs
,
passed
it
rapidly
to
and
fro
in
the
flames
.
*NL*
In
a
moment
the
smell
of
burning
bristles
betrayed
the
object
of
this
*NL*
procedure
.
Having
got
thus
far
in
the
matter
,
the
body
was
removed
to
a
*NL*
little
distance
and
,
being
disembowelled
,
the
entrails
were
laid
aside
*NL*
as
choice
parts
,
and
the
whole
carcass
thoroughly
washed
with
water
.
An
*NL*
ample
thick
green
cloth
,
composed
of
the
long
thick
leaves
of
a
species
*NL*
of
palm-tree
,
ingeniously
tacked
together
with
little
pins
of
bamboo
,
*NL*
was
now
spread
upon
the
ground
,
in
which
the
body
being
carefully
*NL*
rolled
,
it
was
borne
to
an
oven
previously
prepared
to
receive
it
.
Here
*NL*
it
was
at
once
laid
upon
the
heated
stones
at
the
bottom
,
and
covered
*NL*
with
thick
layers
of
leaves
,
the
whole
being
quickly
hidden
from
sight
*NL*
by
a
mound
of
earth
raised
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
the
summary
style
in
which
the
Typees
convert
perverse-minded
*NL*
and
rebellious
hogs
into
the
most
docile
and
amiable
pork
;
a
morsel
*NL*
of
which
placed
on
the
tongue
melts
like
a
soft
smile
from
the
lips
of
*NL*
Beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
commend
their
peculiar
mode
of
proceeding
to
the
consideration
of
all
*NL*
butchers
,
cooks
,
and
housewives
.
The
hapless
porker
whose
fate
I
have
*NL*
just
rehearsed
,
was
not
the
only
one
who
suffered
in
that
memorable
day
.
*NL*
Many
a
dismal
grunt
,
many
an
imploring
squeak
,
proclaimed
what
was
going
*NL*
on
throughout
the
whole
extent
of
the
valley
;
and
I
verily
believe
the
*NL*
first-born
of
every
litter
perished
before
the
setting
of
that
fatal
*NL*
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
around
the
Ti
was
now
most
animated
.
Hogs
and
poee-poee
were
*NL*
baking
in
numerous
ovens
,
which
,
heaped
up
with
fresh
earth
into
slight
*NL*
elevations
,
looked
like
so
many
ant-hills
.
Scores
of
the
savages
were
*NL*
vigorously
plying
their
stone
pestles
in
preparing
masses
of
poee-poee
,
*NL*
and
numbers
were
gathering
green
bread-fruit
and
young
cocoanuts
in
the
*NL*
surrounding
groves
;
when
an
exceeding
great
multitude
,
with
a
view
of
*NL*
encouraging
the
rest
in
their
labours
,
stood
still
,
and
kept
shouting
*NL*
most
lustily
without
intermission
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
peculiarity
among
these
people
,
that
,
when
engaged
in
an
*NL*
employment
,
they
always
make
a
prodigious
fuss
about
it
.
So
seldom
do
*NL*
they
ever
exert
themselves
,
that
when
they
do
work
they
seem
determined
*NL*
that
so
meritorious
an
action
shall
not
escape
the
observation
of
those
*NL*
around
if
,
for
example
,
they
have
occasion
to
remove
a
stone
to
a
little
*NL*
distance
,
which
perhaps
might
be
carried
by
two
able-bodied
men
,
a
whole
*NL*
swarm
gather
about
it
,
and
,
after
a
vast
deal
of
palavering
,
lift
it
*NL*
up
among
them
,
every
one
struggling
to
get
hold
of
it
,
and
bear
it
off
*NL*
yelling
and
panting
as
if
accomplishing
some
mighty
achievement
.
Seeing
*NL*
them
on
these
occasions
,
one
is
reminded
of
an
infinity
of
black
ants
*NL*
clustering
about
and
dragging
away
to
some
hole
the
leg
of
a
deceased
*NL*
fly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
for
some
time
attentively
observed
these
demonstrations
of
good
*NL*
cheer
,
I
entered
the
Ti
,
where
Mehevi
sat
complacently
looking
out
upon
*NL*
the
busy
scene
,
and
occasionally
issuing
his
orders
.
The
chief
appeared
*NL*
to
be
in
an
extraordinary
flow
of
spirits
and
gave
me
to
understand
that
*NL*
on
the
morrow
there
would
be
grand
doings
in
the
Groves
generally
,
and
*NL*
at
the
Ti
in
particular
;
and
urged
me
by
no
means
to
absent
myself
.
In
*NL*
commemoration
of
what
event
,
however
,
or
in
honour
of
what
*NL*
distinguished
personage
,
the
feast
was
to
be
given
,
altogether
passed
my
*NL*
comprehension
.
Mehevi
sought
to
enlighten
my
ignorance
,
but
he
failed
as
*NL*
signally
as
when
he
had
endeavoured
to
initiate
me
into
the
perplexing
*NL*
arcana
of
the
taboo
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
leaving
the
Ti
,
Kory-Kory
,
who
had
as
a
matter
of
course
accompanied
*NL*
me
,
observing
that
my
curiosity
remained
unabated
,
resolved
to
make
*NL*
everything
plain
and
satisfactory
.
With
this
intent
,
he
escorted
*NL*
me
through
the
Taboo
Groves
,
pointing
out
to
my
notice
a
variety
of
*NL*
objects
,
and
endeavoured
to
explain
them
in
such
an
indescribable
jargon
*NL*
of
words
,
that
it
almost
put
me
in
bodily
pain
to
listen
to
him
.
In
*NL*
particular
,
he
led
me
to
a
remarkable
pyramidical
structure
some
three
*NL*
yards
square
at
the
base
,
and
perhaps
ten
feet
in
height
,
which
had
*NL*
lately
been
thrown
up
,
and
occupied
a
very
conspicuous
position
.
It
*NL*
was
composed
principally
of
large
empty
calabashes
,
with
a
few
polished
*NL*
cocoanut
shells
,
and
looked
not
unlike
a
cenotaph
of
skulls
.
My
cicerone
*NL*
perceived
the
astonishment
with
which
I
gazed
at
this
monument
of
savage
*NL*
crockery
,
and
immediately
addressed
himself
in
the
task
of
enlightening
*NL*
me
:
but
all
in
vain
;
and
to
this
hour
the
nature
of
the
monument
remains
*NL*
a
complete
mystery
to
me
.
As
,
however
,
it
formed
so
prominent
a
feature
*NL*
in
the
approaching
revels
,
I
bestowed
upon
the
latter
,
in
my
own
mind
,
*NL*
the
title
of
the
`
Feast
of
Calabashes
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
morning
,
awaking
rather
late
,
I
perceived
the
whole
of
*NL*
Marheyo
's
family
busily
engaged
in
preparing
for
the
festival
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
warrior
himself
was
arranging
in
round
balls
the
two
grey
locks
*NL*
of
hair
that
were
suffered
to
grow
from
the
crown
of
his
head
;
his
*NL*
earrings
and
spear
,
both
well
polished
,
lay
beside
him
,
while
the
highly
*NL*
decorative
pair
of
shoes
hung
suspended
from
a
projecting
cane
against
*NL*
the
side
of
the
house
.
The
young
men
were
similarly
employed
;
and
the
*NL*
fair
damsels
,
including
Fayaway
,
were
anointing
themselves
with
`
aka
'
,
*NL*
arranging
their
long
tresses
,
and
performing
other
matters
connected
*NL*
with
the
duties
of
the
toilet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
completed
their
preparations
,
the
girls
now
exhibited
themselves
*NL*
in
gala
costume
;
the
most
conspicuous
feature
of
which
was
a
necklace
*NL*
of
beautiful
white
flowers
,
with
the
stems
removed
,
and
strung
closely
*NL*
together
upon
a
single
fibre
of
tappa
.
Corresponding
ornaments
were
*NL*
inserted
in
their
ears
,
and
woven
garlands
upon
their
heads
.
About
their
*NL*
waist
they
wore
a
short
tunic
of
spotless
white
tappa
,
and
some
of
them
*NL*
super-added
to
this
a
mantle
of
the
same
material
,
tied
in
an
elaborate
*NL*
bow
upon
the
left
shoulder
,
and
falling
about
the
figure
in
picturesque
*NL*
folds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
arrayed
,
I
would
have
matched
the
charming
Fayaway
against
any
*NL*
beauty
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
may
say
what
they
will
about
the
taste
evinced
by
our
fashionable
*NL*
ladies
in
dress
.
Their
jewels
,
their
feathers
,
their
silks
,
and
*NL*
their
furbelows
,
would
have
sunk
into
utter
insignificance
beside
the
*NL*
exquisite
simplicity
of
attire
adopted
by
the
nymphs
of
the
vale
on
this
*NL*
festive
occasion
.
I
should
like
to
have
seen
a
gallery
of
coronation
*NL*
beauties
,
at
Westminster
Abbey
,
confronted
for
a
moment
by
this
band
of
*NL*
island
girls
;
their
stiffness
,
formality
,
and
affectation
,
contrasted
*NL*
with
the
artless
vivacity
and
unconcealed
natural
graces
of
these
savage
*NL*
maidens
.
It
would
be
the
Venus
de
'
Medici
placed
beside
a
milliner
's
*NL*
doll
.
It
was
not
long
before
Kory-Kory
and
myself
were
left
alone
in
the
*NL*
house
,
the
rest
of
its
inmates
having
departed
for
the
Taboo
Groves
.
*NL*
My
valet
was
all
impatience
to
follow
them
;
and
was
as
fidgety
about
my
*NL*
dilatory
movements
as
a
diner
out
waiting
hat
in
hand
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
stairs
for
some
lagging
companion
.
At
last
,
yielding
to
his
*NL*
importunities
,
I
set
out
for
the
Ti
.
As
we
passed
the
houses
peeping
out
*NL*
from
the
groves
through
which
our
route
lay
,
I
noticed
that
they
were
*NL*
entirely
deserted
by
their
inhabitants
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
reached
the
rock
that
abruptly
terminated
the
path
,
and
*NL*
concealed
from
us
the
festive
scene
,
wild
shouts
and
a
confused
blending
*NL*
of
voices
assured
me
that
the
occasion
,
whatever
it
might
be
,
had
*NL*
drawn
together
a
great
multitude
.
Kory-Kory
,
previous
to
mounting
the
*NL*
elevation
,
paused
for
a
moment
,
like
a
dandy
at
a
ball-room
door
,
to
put
*NL*
a
hasty
finish
to
his
toilet
.
During
this
short
interval
,
the
thought
*NL*
struck
me
that
I
ought
myself
perhaps
to
be
taking
some
little
pains
*NL*
with
my
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
I
had
no
holiday
raiment
,
I
was
not
a
little
puzzled
to
devise
*NL*
some
means
of
decorating
myself
.
However
,
as
I
felt
desirous
to
create
a
*NL*
sensation
,
I
determined
to
do
all
that
lay
in
my
power
;
and
knowing
that
*NL*
I
could
not
delight
the
savages
more
than
by
conforming
to
their
style
*NL*
of
dress
,
I
removed
from
my
person
the
large
robe
of
tappa
which
I
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
wear
over
my
shoulders
whenever
I
sallied
into
the
open
*NL*
air
,
and
remained
merely
girt
about
with
a
short
tunic
descending
from
*NL*
my
waist
to
my
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
quick-witted
attendant
fully
appreciated
the
compliment
I
was
paying
*NL*
to
the
costume
of
his
race
,
and
began
more
sedulously
to
arrange
the
*NL*
folds
of
the
one
only
garment
which
remained
to
me
.
Whilst
he
was
doing
*NL*
this
,
I
caught
sight
of
a
knot
of
young
lasses
,
who
were
sitting
near
us
*NL*
on
the
grass
surrounded
by
heaps
of
flowers
which
they
were
forming
into
*NL*
garlands
.
I
motioned
to
them
to
bring
some
of
their
handywork
to
me
;
*NL*
and
in
an
instant
a
dozen
wreaths
were
at
my
disposal
.
One
of
them
I
*NL*
put
round
the
apology
for
a
hat
which
I
had
been
forced
to
construct
for
*NL*
myself
out
of
palmetto-leaves
,
and
some
of
the
others
I
converted
into
a
*NL*
splendid
girdle
.
These
operations
finished
,
with
the
slow
and
dignified
*NL*
step
of
a
full-dressed
beau
I
ascended
the
rock
.

CHAPTER
TWENTY-THREE
*NL*
*NL*
THE
FEAST
OF
CALABASHES
*NL*
*NL*
THE
whole
population
of
the
valley
seemed
to
be
gathered
within
the
*NL*
precincts
of
the
grove
.
In
the
distance
could
be
seen
the
long
front
of
*NL*
the
Ti
,
its
immense
piazza
swarming
with
men
,
arrayed
in
every
variety
*NL*
of
fantastic
costume
,
and
all
vociferating
with
animated
gestures
;
while
*NL*
the
whole
interval
between
it
and
the
place
where
I
stood
was
enlivened
*NL*
by
groups
of
females
fancifully
decorated
,
dancing
,
capering
,
and
*NL*
uttering
wild
exclamations
.
As
soon
as
they
descried
me
they
set
up
a
*NL*
shout
of
welcome
;
and
a
band
of
them
came
dancing
towards
me
,
chanting
*NL*
as
they
approached
some
wild
recitative
.
The
change
in
my
garb
seemed
to
*NL*
transport
them
with
delight
,
and
clustering
about
me
on
all
sides
,
they
*NL*
accompanied
me
towards
the
Ti
.
When
however
we
drew
near
it
these
joyous
*NL*
nymphs
paused
in
their
career
,
and
parting
on
either
side
,
permitted
me
*NL*
to
pass
on
to
the
now
densely
thronged
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
soon
as
I
mounted
to
the
pi-pi
I
saw
at
a
glance
that
the
revels
were
*NL*
fairly
under
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
lavish
plenty
reigned
around
?
--
Warwick
feasting
his
retainers
with
*NL*
beef
and
ale
,
was
a
niggard
to
the
noble
Mehevi
!
--
All
along
the
piazza
*NL*
of
the
Ti
were
arranged
elaborately
carved
canoe-shaped
vessels
,
some
*NL*
twenty
feet
in
length
,
tied
with
newly
made
poee-poee
,
and
sheltered
*NL*
from
the
sun
by
the
broad
leaves
of
the
banana
.
At
intervals
were
heaps
*NL*
of
green
bread-fruit
,
raised
in
pyramidical
stacks
,
resembling
the
*NL*
regular
piles
of
heavy
shot
to
be
seen
in
the
yard
of
an
arsenal
.
*NL*
Inserted
into
the
interstices
of
the
huge
stones
which
formed
the
pi-pi
*NL*
were
large
boughs
of
trees
;
hanging
from
the
branches
of
which
,
and
*NL*
screened
from
the
sun
by
their
foliage
,
were
innumerable
little
packages
*NL*
with
leafy
coverings
,
containing
the
meat
of
the
numerous
hogs
which
*NL*
had
been
slain
,
done
up
in
this
manner
to
make
it
more
accessible
to
the
*NL*
crowd
.
Leaning
against
the
railing
on
the
piazza
were
an
immense
*NL*
number
of
long
,
heavy
bamboos
,
plugged
at
the
lower
end
,
and
with
their
*NL*
projecting
muzzles
stuffed
with
a
wad
of
leaves
.
These
were
filled
with
*NL*
water
from
the
stream
,
and
each
of
them
might
hold
from
four
to
five
*NL*
gallons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
banquet
being
thus
spread
,
naught
remained
but
for
everyone
to
*NL*
help
himself
at
his
pleasure
.
Accordingly
not
a
moment
passed
but
the
*NL*
transplanted
boughs
I
have
mentioned
were
rifled
by
the
throng
of
the
*NL*
fruit
they
certainly
had
never
borne
before
.
Calabashes
of
poee-poee
*NL*
were
continually
being
replenished
from
the
extensive
receptacle
in
*NL*
which
that
article
was
stored
,
and
multitudes
of
little
fires
were
*NL*
kindled
about
the
Ti
for
the
purpose
of
roasting
the
bread-fruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
the
building
itself
was
presented
a
most
extraordinary
scene
.
The
*NL*
immense
lounge
of
mats
lying
between
the
parallel
rows
of
the
trunks
of
*NL*
cocoanut
trees
,
and
extending
the
entire
length
of
the
house
,
at
least
*NL*
two
hundred
feet
,
was
covered
by
the
reclining
forms
of
a
host
of
chiefs
*NL*
and
warriors
who
were
eating
at
a
great
rate
,
or
soothing
the
cares
of
*NL*
Polynesian
life
in
the
sedative
fumes
of
tobacco
.
The
smoke
was
inhaled
*NL*
from
large
pipes
,
the
bowls
of
which
,
made
out
of
small
cocoanut
shells
,
*NL*
were
curiously
carved
in
strange
heathenish
devices
.
These
were
passed
*NL*
from
mouth
to
mouth
by
the
recumbent
smokers
,
each
of
whom
,
taking
two
*NL*
or
three
prodigious
whiffs
,
handed
the
pipe
to
his
neighbour
;
sometimes
*NL*
for
that
purpose
stretching
indolently
across
the
body
of
some
dozing
*NL*
individual
whose
exertions
at
the
dinner-table
had
already
induced
*NL*
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tobacco
used
among
the
Typees
was
of
a
very
mild
and
pleasing
*NL*
flavour
,
and
as
I
always
saw
it
in
leaves
,
and
the
natives
appeared
*NL*
pretty
well
supplied
with
it
,
I
was
led
to
believe
that
it
must
have
*NL*
been
the
growth
of
the
valley
.
Indeed
Kory-Kory
gave
me
to
understand
*NL*
that
this
was
the
case
;
but
I
never
saw
a
single
plant
growing
on
the
*NL*
island
.
At
Nukuheva
,
and
,
I
believe
,
in
all
the
other
valleys
,
the
weed
*NL*
is
very
scarce
,
being
only
obtained
in
small
quantities
from
foreigners
,
*NL*
and
smoking
is
consequently
with
the
inhabitants
of
these
places
a
very
*NL*
great
luxury
.
How
it
was
that
the
Typees
were
so
well
furnished
with
*NL*
it
I
can
not
divine
.
I
should
think
them
too
indolent
to
devote
any
*NL*
attention
to
its
culture
;
and
,
indeed
,
as
far
as
my
observation
*NL*
extended
,
not
a
single
atom
of
the
soil
was
under
any
other
cultivation
*NL*
than
that
of
shower
and
sunshine
.
The
tobacco-plant
,
however
,
like
the
*NL*
sugar-cane
,
may
grow
wild
in
some
remote
part
of
the
vale
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
many
in
the
Ti
for
whom
the
tobacco
did
not
furnish
a
*NL*
sufficient
stimulus
,
and
who
accordingly
had
recourse
to
`
arva
'
,
as
a
*NL*
more
powerful
agent
in
producing
the
desired
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Arva
'
is
a
root
very
generally
dispersed
over
the
South
Seas
,
and
from
*NL*
it
is
extracted
a
juice
,
the
effects
of
which
upon
the
system
are
at
*NL*
first
stimulating
in
a
moderate
degree
;
but
it
soon
relaxes
the
muscles
,
*NL*
and
exerting
a
narcotic
influence
produces
a
luxurious
sleep
.
In
*NL*
the
valley
this
beverage
was
universally
prepared
in
the
following
*NL*
way
:
--
Some
half-dozen
young
boys
seated
themselves
in
a
circle
around
*NL*
an
empty
wooden
vessel
,
each
one
of
them
being
supplied
with
a
certain
*NL*
quantity
of
the
roots
of
the
`
arva
'
,
broken
into
small
bits
and
laid
*NL*
by
his
side
.
A
cocoanut
goblet
of
water
was
passed
around
the
juvenile
*NL*
company
,
who
rinsing
their
mouths
with
its
contents
,
proceeded
to
the
*NL*
business
before
them
.
This
merely
consisted
in
thoroughly
masticating
*NL*
the
`
arva
'
,
and
throwing
it
mouthful
after
mouthful
into
the
receptacle
*NL*
provided
.
When
a
sufficient
quantity
had
been
thus
obtained
water
was
*NL*
poured
upon
the
mass
,
and
being
stirred
about
with
the
forefinger
of
the
*NL*
right
hand
,
the
preparation
was
soon
in
readiness
for
use
.
The
`
arva
'
*NL*
has
medicinal
qualities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
the
Sandwich
Islands
it
has
been
employed
with
no
small
success
in
*NL*
the
treatment
of
scrofulous
affections
,
and
in
combating
the
ravages
*NL*
of
a
disease
for
whose
frightful
inroads
the
ill-starred
inhabitants
of
*NL*
that
group
are
indebted
to
their
foreign
benefactors
.
But
the
tenants
of
*NL*
the
Typee
valley
,
as
yet
exempt
from
these
inflictions
,
generally
employ
*NL*
the
`
arva
'
as
a
minister
to
social
enjoyment
,
and
a
calabash
of
the
*NL*
liquid
circulates
among
them
as
the
bottle
with
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mehevi
,
who
was
greatly
delighted
with
the
change
in
my
costume
,
gave
*NL*
me
a
cordial
welcome
.
He
had
reserved
for
me
a
most
delectable
mess
*NL*
of
`
cokoo
'
,
well
knowing
my
partiality
for
that
dish
;
and
had
likewise
*NL*
selected
three
or
four
young
cocoanuts
,
several
roasted
bread-fruit
,
*NL*
and
a
magnificent
bunch
of
bananas
,
for
my
especial
comfort
and
*NL*
gratification
.
These
various
matters
were
at
once
placed
before
me
;
but
*NL*
Kory-Kory
deemed
the
banquet
entirely
insufficient
for
my
wants
until
*NL*
he
had
supplied
me
with
one
of
the
leafy
packages
of
pork
,
which
,
*NL*
notwithstanding
the
somewhat
hasty
manner
in
which
it
had
been
prepared
,
*NL*
possessed
a
most
excellent
flavour
,
and
was
surprisingly
sweet
and
*NL*
tender
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pork
is
not
a
staple
article
of
food
among
the
people
of
the
Marquesas
;
*NL*
consequently
they
pay
little
attention
to
the
BREEDING
of
the
swine
.
The
*NL*
hogs
are
permitted
to
roam
at
large
on
the
groves
,
where
they
obtain
*NL*
no
small
part
of
their
nourishment
from
the
cocoanuts
which
continually
*NL*
fall
from
the
trees
.
But
it
is
only
after
infinite
labour
and
*NL*
difficulty
,
that
the
hungry
animal
can
pierce
the
husk
and
shell
so
as
*NL*
to
get
at
the
meat
.
I
have
frequently
been
amused
at
seeing
one
of
*NL*
them
,
after
crunching
the
obstinate
nut
with
his
teeth
for
a
long
time
*NL*
unsuccessfully
,
get
into
a
violent
passion
with
it
.
He
would
then
root
*NL*
furiously
under
the
cocoanut
,
and
,
with
a
fling
of
his
snout
,
toss
it
*NL*
before
him
on
the
ground
.
Following
it
up
,
he
would
crunch
at
it
again
*NL*
savagely
for
a
moment
,
and
then
next
knock
it
on
one
side
,
pausing
*NL*
immediately
after
,
as
if
wondering
how
it
could
so
suddenly
have
*NL*
disappeared
.
In
this
way
the
persecuted
cocoanuts
were
often
chased
half
*NL*
across
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
day
of
the
Feast
of
Calabashes
was
ushered
in
by
still
more
*NL*
uproarious
noises
than
the
first
.
The
skins
of
innumerable
sheep
seemed
*NL*
to
be
resounding
to
the
blows
of
an
army
of
drummers
.
Startled
from
my
*NL*
slumbers
by
the
din
,
I
leaped
up
,
and
found
the
whole
household
engaged
*NL*
in
making
preparations
for
immediate
departure
.
Curious
to
discover
of
*NL*
what
strange
events
these
novel
sounds
might
be
the
precursors
,
and
not
*NL*
a
little
desirous
to
catch
a
sight
of
the
instruments
which
produced
*NL*
the
terrific
noise
,
I
accompanied
the
natives
as
soon
as
they
were
in
*NL*
readiness
to
depart
for
the
Taboo
Groves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
comparatively
open
space
that
extended
from
the
Ti
toward
the
rock
,
*NL*
to
which
I
have
before
alluded
as
forming
the
ascent
to
the
place
,
was
,
*NL*
with
the
building
itself
,
now
altogether
deserted
by
the
men
;
the
whole
*NL*
distance
being
filled
by
bands
of
females
,
shouting
and
dancing
under
*NL*
the
influence
of
some
strange
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
amused
at
the
appearance
of
four
or
five
old
women
who
,
in
a
state
*NL*
of
utter
nudity
,
with
their
arms
extended
flatly
down
their
sides
,
and
*NL*
holding
themselves
perfectly
erect
,
were
leaping
stiffly
into
the
*NL*
air
,
like
so
many
sticks
bobbing
to
the
surface
,
after
being
pressed
*NL*
perpendicularly
into
the
water
.
They
preserved
the
utmost
gravity
of
*NL*
countenance
,
and
continued
their
extraordinary
movements
without
*NL*
a
single
moment
's
cessation
.
They
did
not
appear
to
attract
the
*NL*
observation
of
the
crowd
around
them
,
but
I
must
candidly
confess
that
*NL*
for
my
own
part
,
I
stared
at
them
most
pertinaciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Desirous
of
being
enlightened
in
regard
to
the
meaning
of
this
peculiar
*NL*
diversion
,
I
turned
,
inquiringly
to
Kory-Kory
;
that
learned
Typee
*NL*
immediately
proceeded
to
explain
the
whole
matter
thoroughly
.
But
all
*NL*
that
I
could
comprehend
from
what
he
said
was
,
that
the
leaping
figures
*NL*
before
me
were
bereaved
widows
,
whose
partners
had
been
slain
in
battle
*NL*
many
moons
previously
;
and
who
,
at
every
festival
,
gave
public
evidence
*NL*
in
this
manner
of
their
calamities
.
It
was
evident
that
Kory-Kory
*NL*
considered
this
an
all-sufficient
reason
for
so
indecorous
a
custom
;
but
*NL*
I
must
say
that
it
did
not
satisfy
me
as
to
its
propriety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
these
afflicted
females
,
we
passed
on
to
the
Hoolah
Hoolah
*NL*
ground
.
Within
the
spacious
quadrangle
,
the
whole
population
of
the
*NL*
valley
seemed
to
be
assembled
,
and
the
sight
presented
was
truly
*NL*
remarkable
.
Beneath
the
sheds
of
bamboo
which
opened
towards
the
*NL*
interior
of
the
square
reclined
the
principal
chiefs
and
warriors
,
while
*NL*
a
miscellaneous
throng
lay
at
their
ease
under
the
enormous
trees
which
*NL*
spread
a
majestic
canopy
overhead
.
Upon
the
terraces
of
the
gigantic
*NL*
altars
,
at
each
end
,
were
deposited
green
bread-fruit
in
baskets
of
*NL*
cocoanut
leaves
,
large
rolls
of
tappa
,
bunches
of
ripe
bananas
,
clusters
*NL*
of
mammee-apples
,
the
golden-hued
fruit
of
the
artu-tree
,
and
baked
*NL*
hogs
,
laid
out
in
large
wooden
trenchers
,
fancifully
decorated
with
*NL*
freshly
plucked
leaves
,
whilst
a
variety
of
rude
implements
of
war
were
*NL*
piled
in
confused
heaps
before
the
ranks
of
hideous
idols
.
Fruits
of
*NL*
various
kinds
were
likewise
suspended
in
leafen
baskets
,
from
the
tops
*NL*
of
poles
planted
uprightly
,
and
at
regular
intervals
,
along
the
lower
*NL*
terraces
of
both
altars
.
At
their
base
were
arranged
two
parallel
rows
*NL*
of
cumbersome
drums
,
standing
at
least
fifteen
feet
in
height
,
and
*NL*
formed
from
the
hollow
trunks
of
large
trees
.
Their
heads
were
covered
*NL*
with
shark
skins
,
and
their
barrels
were
elaborately
carved
with
various
*NL*
quaint
figures
and
devices
.
At
regular
intervals
they
were
bound
round
*NL*
by
a
species
of
sinnate
of
various
colours
,
and
strips
of
native
cloth
*NL*
flattened
upon
them
here
and
there
.
Behind
these
instruments
were
built
*NL*
slight
platforms
,
upon
which
stood
a
number
of
young
men
who
,
beating
*NL*
violently
with
the
palms
of
their
hands
upon
the
drum-heads
,
produced
*NL*
those
outrageous
sounds
which
had
awakened
me
in
the
morning
.
Every
few
*NL*
minutes
these
musical
performers
hopped
down
from
their
elevation
into
*NL*
the
crowd
below
,
and
their
places
were
immediately
supplied
by
fresh
*NL*
recruits
.
Thus
an
incessant
din
was
kept
up
that
might
have
startled
*NL*
Pandemonium
.
*NL*
*NL*
Precisely
in
the
middle
of
the
quadrangle
were
placed
perpendicularly
*NL*
in
the
ground
,
a
hundred
or
more
slender
,
fresh-cut
poles
,
stripped
of
*NL*
their
bark
,
and
decorated
at
the
end
with
a
floating
pennon
of
white
*NL*
tappa
;
the
whole
being
fenced
about
with
a
little
picket
of
canes
.
For
*NL*
what
purpose
these
angular
ornaments
were
intended
I
in
vain
endeavoured
*NL*
to
discover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
most
striking
feature
of
the
performance
was
exhibited
by
a
*NL*
score
of
old
men
,
who
sat
cross-legged
in
the
little
pulpits
,
which
*NL*
encircled
the
trunks
of
the
immense
trees
growing
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
enclosure
.
These
venerable
gentlemen
,
who
I
presume
were
the
priests
,
*NL*
kept
up
an
uninterrupted
monotonous
chant
,
which
was
partly
drowned
in
*NL*
the
roar
of
drums
.
In
the
right
hand
they
held
a
finely
woven
grass
fan
,
*NL*
with
a
heavy
black
wooden
handle
curiously
chased
:
these
fans
they
kept
*NL*
in
continual
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
no
attention
whatever
seemed
to
be
paid
to
the
drummers
or
to
the
*NL*
old
priests
;
the
individuals
who
composed
the
vast
crowd
present
being
*NL*
entirely
taken
up
in
chanting
and
laughing
with
one
another
,
smoking
,
*NL*
drinking
`
arva
'
,
and
eating
.
For
all
the
observation
it
attracted
,
*NL*
or
the
good
it
achieved
,
the
whole
savage
orchestra
might
with
great
*NL*
advantage
to
its
own
members
and
the
company
in
general
,
have
ceased
the
*NL*
prodigious
uproar
they
were
making
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
I
questioned
Kory-Kory
and
others
of
the
natives
,
as
to
the
*NL*
meaning
of
the
strange
things
that
were
going
on
;
all
their
explanations
*NL*
were
conveyed
in
such
a
mass
of
outlandish
gibberish
and
gesticulation
*NL*
that
I
gave
up
the
attempt
in
despair
.
All
that
day
the
drums
resounded
,
*NL*
the
priests
chanted
,
and
the
multitude
feasted
and
roared
till
sunset
,
*NL*
when
the
throng
dispersed
,
and
the
Taboo
Groves
were
again
abandoned
to
*NL*
quiet
and
repose
.
The
next
day
the
same
scene
was
repeated
until
night
,
*NL*
when
this
singular
festival
terminated
.

*NL*
ALTHOUGH
I
had
been
baffled
in
my
attempts
to
learn
the
origin
of
*NL*
the
Feast
of
Calabashes
,
yet
it
seemed
very
plain
to
me
that
it
was
*NL*
principally
,
if
not
wholly
,
of
a
religious
character
.
As
a
religious
*NL*
solemnity
,
however
,
it
had
not
at
all
corresponded
with
the
horrible
*NL*
descriptions
of
Polynesian
worship
which
we
have
received
in
some
*NL*
published
narratives
,
and
especially
in
those
accounts
of
the
*NL*
evangelized
islands
with
which
the
missionaries
have
favoured
us
.
Did
*NL*
not
the
sacred
character
of
these
persons
render
the
purity
of
their
*NL*
intentions
unquestionable
,
I
should
certainly
be
led
to
suppose
that
*NL*
they
had
exaggerated
the
evils
of
Paganism
,
in
order
to
enhance
the
*NL*
merit
of
their
own
disinterested
labours
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
certain
work
incidentally
treating
of
the
`
Washington
,
or
Northern
*NL*
Marquesas
Islands
,
'
I
have
seen
the
frequent
immolation
of
human
victims
*NL*
upon
the
altars
of
their
gods
,
positively
and
repeatedly
charged
upon
*NL*
the
inhabitants
.
The
same
work
gives
also
a
rather
minute
account
of
*NL*
their
religion
--
enumerates
a
great
many
of
their
superstitions
--
and
*NL*
makes
known
the
particular
designations
of
numerous
orders
of
the
*NL*
priesthood
.
One
would
almost
imagine
from
the
long
list
that
is
given
*NL*
of
cannibal
primates
,
bishops
,
arch-deacons
,
prebendaries
,
and
other
*NL*
inferior
ecclesiastics
,
that
the
sacerdotal
order
far
outnumbered
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
population
,
and
that
the
poor
natives
were
more
severely
*NL*
priest-ridden
than
even
the
inhabitants
of
the
papal
states
.
These
*NL*
accounts
are
likewise
calculated
to
leave
upon
the
reader
's
mind
an
*NL*
impression
that
human
victims
are
daily
cooked
and
served
up
upon
the
*NL*
altars
;
that
heathenish
cruelties
of
every
description
are
continually
*NL*
practised
;
and
that
these
ignorant
Pagans
are
in
a
state
of
the
*NL*
extremest
wretchedness
in
consequence
of
the
grossness
of
their
*NL*
superstitions
.
Be
it
observed
,
however
,
that
all
this
information
is
*NL*
given
by
a
man
who
,
according
to
his
own
statement
,
was
only
at
one
of
*NL*
the
islands
,
and
remained
there
but
two
weeks
,
sleeping
every
night
on
*NL*
board
his
ship
,
and
taking
little
kid-glove
excursions
ashore
in
the
*NL*
daytime
,
attended
by
an
armed
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
all
I
can
say
is
,
that
in
all
my
excursions
through
the
valley
of
*NL*
Typee
,
I
never
saw
any
of
these
alleged
enormities
.
If
any
of
them
are
*NL*
practised
upon
the
Marquesas
Islands
they
must
certainly
have
come
to
*NL*
my
knowledge
while
living
for
months
with
a
tribe
of
savages
,
wholly
*NL*
unchanged
from
their
original
primitive
condition
,
and
reputed
the
most
*NL*
ferocious
in
the
South
Seas
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
is
,
that
there
is
a
vast
deal
of
unintentional
humbuggery
*NL*
in
some
of
the
accounts
we
have
from
scientific
men
concerning
the
*NL*
religious
institutions
of
Polynesia
.
These
learned
tourists
generally
*NL*
obtain
the
greater
part
of
their
information
from
retired
old
South-Sea
*NL*
rovers
,
who
have
domesticated
themselves
among
the
barbarous
tribes
of
*NL*
the
Pacific
.
Jack
,
who
has
long
been
accustomed
to
the
long-bow
,
and
*NL*
to
spin
tough
yarns
on
the
ship
's
forecastle
,
invariably
officiates
as
*NL*
showman
of
the
island
on
which
he
has
settled
,
and
having
mastered
a
few
*NL*
dozen
words
of
the
language
,
is
supposed
to
know
all
about
the
people
*NL*
who
speak
it
.
A
natural
desire
to
make
himself
of
consequence
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
strangers
,
prompts
him
to
lay
claim
to
a
much
greater
*NL*
knowledge
of
such
matters
than
he
actually
possesses
.
In
reply
to
*NL*
incessant
queries
,
he
communicates
not
only
all
he
knows
but
a
good
deal
*NL*
more
,
and
if
there
be
any
information
deficient
still
he
is
at
no
*NL*
loss
to
supply
it
.
The
avidity
with
which
his
anecdotes
are
noted
*NL*
down
tickles
his
vanity
,
and
his
powers
of
invention
increase
with
the
*NL*
credulity
auditors
.
He
knows
just
the
sort
of
information
wanted
,
and
*NL*
furnishes
it
to
any
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
not
a
supposed
case
;
I
have
met
with
several
individuals
like
*NL*
the
one
described
,
and
I
have
been
present
at
two
or
three
of
their
*NL*
interviews
with
strangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
when
the
scientific
voyager
arrives
at
home
with
his
collection
*NL*
of
wonders
,
he
attempts
,
perhaps
,
to
give
a
description
of
some
of
the
*NL*
strange
people
he
has
been
visiting
.
Instead
of
representing
them
as
*NL*
a
community
of
lusty
savages
,
who
are
leading
a
merry
,
idle
,
innocent
*NL*
life
,
he
enters
into
a
very
circumstantial
and
learned
narrative
of
*NL*
certain
unaccountable
superstitions
and
practices
,
about
which
he
knows
*NL*
as
little
as
the
islanders
themselves
.
Having
had
little
time
,
and
*NL*
scarcely
any
opportunity
,
to
become
acquainted
with
the
customs
he
*NL*
pretends
to
describe
,
he
writes
them
down
one
after
another
in
an
*NL*
off-hand
,
haphazard
style
;
and
were
the
book
thus
produced
to
be
*NL*
translated
into
the
tongue
of
the
people
of
whom
it
purports
to
give
the
*NL*
history
,
it
would
appear
quite
as
wonderful
to
them
as
it
does
to
the
*NL*
American
public
,
and
much
more
improbable
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
I
am
free
to
confess
my
almost
entire
inability
to
*NL*
gratify
any
curiosity
that
may
be
felt
with
regard
to
the
theology
of
*NL*
the
valley
.
I
doubt
whether
the
inhabitants
themselves
could
do
so
.
They
*NL*
are
either
too
lazy
or
too
sensible
to
worry
themselves
about
abstract
*NL*
points
of
religious
belief
.
While
I
was
among
them
,
they
never
held
any
*NL*
synods
or
councils
to
settle
the
principles
of
their
faith
by
agitating
*NL*
them
.
An
unbounded
liberty
of
conscience
seemed
to
prevail
.
Those
*NL*
who
pleased
to
do
so
were
allowed
to
repose
implicit
faith
in
an
*NL*
ill-favoured
god
with
a
large
bottle-nose
and
fat
shapeless
arms
crossed
*NL*
upon
his
breast
;
whilst
others
worshipped
an
image
which
,
having
no
*NL*
likeness
either
in
heaven
or
on
earth
,
could
hardly
be
called
an
idol
.
*NL*
As
the
islanders
always
maintained
a
discreet
reserve
with
regard
to
*NL*
my
own
peculiar
views
on
religion
,
I
thought
it
would
be
excessively
*NL*
ill-bred
of
me
to
pry
into
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
although
my
knowledge
of
the
religious
faith
of
the
Typees
was
*NL*
unavoidably
limited
,
one
of
their
superstitious
observances
with
which
I
*NL*
became
acquainted
interested
me
greatly
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
the
most
secluded
portions
of
the
valley
within
a
stone
's
*NL*
cast
of
Fayaway
's
lake
--
for
so
I
christened
the
scene
of
our
island
*NL*
yachting
--
and
hard
by
a
growth
of
palms
,
which
stood
ranged
in
order
*NL*
along
both
banks
of
the
stream
,
waving
their
green
arms
as
if
to
do
*NL*
honour
to
its
passage
,
was
the
mausoleum
of
a
deceased
,
warrior
chief
.
*NL*
Like
all
the
other
edifices
of
any
note
,
it
was
raised
upon
a
small
*NL*
pi-pi
of
stones
,
which
,
being
of
unusual
height
,
was
a
conspicuous
*NL*
object
from
a
distance
.
A
light
thatching
of
bleached
palmetto-leaves
*NL*
hung
over
it
like
a
self
supported
canopy
;
for
it
was
not
until
you
*NL*
came
very
near
that
you
saw
it
was
supported
by
four
slender
columns
of
*NL*
bamboo
rising
at
each
corner
to
a
little
more
than
the
height
of
a
man
.
*NL*
A
clear
area
of
a
few
yards
surrounded
the
pi-pi
,
and
was
enclosed
by
*NL*
four
trunks
of
cocoanut
trees
resting
at
the
angles
on
massive
blocks
of
*NL*
stone
.
The
place
was
sacred
.
The
sign
of
the
inscrutable
Taboo
was
seen
*NL*
in
the
shape
of
a
mystic
roll
of
white
tappa
,
suspended
by
a
twisted
*NL*
cord
of
the
same
material
from
the
top
of
a
slight
pole
planted
within
*NL*
the
enclosure
*
.
The
sanctity
of
the
spot
appeared
never
to
have
been
*NL*
violated
.
The
stillness
of
the
grave
was
there
,
and
the
calm
solitude
*NL*
around
was
beautiful
and
touching
.
The
soft
shadows
of
those
lofty
*NL*
palm-trees
!
--
I
can
see
them
now
--
hanging
over
the
little
temple
,
as
if
*NL*
to
keep
out
the
intrusive
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
White
appears
to
be
the
sacred
colour
among
the
Marquesans
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
all
sides
as
you
approached
this
silent
spot
you
caught
sight
of
the
*NL*
dead
chief
's
effigy
,
seated
in
the
stern
of
a
canoe
,
which
was
raised
on
*NL*
a
light
frame
a
few
inches
above
the
level
of
the
pi-pi
.
The
canoe
was
*NL*
about
seven
feet
in
length
;
of
a
rich
,
dark
coloured
wood
,
handsomely
*NL*
carved
and
adorned
in
many
places
with
variegated
bindings
of
stained
*NL*
sinnate
,
into
which
were
ingeniously
wrought
a
number
of
sparkling
*NL*
seashells
,
and
a
belt
of
the
same
shells
ran
all
round
it
.
The
body
*NL*
of
the
figure
--
of
whatever
material
it
might
have
been
made
--
was
*NL*
effectually
concealed
in
a
heavy
robe
of
brown
tappa
,
revealing
;
only
*NL*
the
hands
and
head
;
the
latter
skilfully
carved
in
wood
,
and
surmounted
*NL*
by
a
superb
arch
of
plumes
.
These
plumes
,
in
the
subdued
and
gentle
*NL*
gales
which
found
access
to
this
sequestered
spot
,
were
never
for
one
*NL*
moment
at
rest
,
but
kept
nodding
and
waving
over
the
chief
's
brow
.
The
*NL*
long
leaves
of
the
palmetto
drooped
over
the
eaves
,
and
through
them
you
*NL*
saw
the
warrior
holding
his
paddle
with
both
hands
in
the
act
of
rowing
,
*NL*
leaning
forward
and
inclining
his
head
,
as
if
eager
to
hurry
on
his
*NL*
voyage
.
Glaring
at
him
forever
,
and
face
to
face
,
was
a
polished
human
*NL*
skull
,
which
crowned
the
prow
of
the
canoe
.
The
spectral
figurehead
,
*NL*
reversed
in
its
position
,
glancing
backwards
,
seemed
to
mock
the
*NL*
impatient
attitude
of
the
warrior
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
first
visited
this
singular
place
with
Kory-Kory
,
he
told
me
--
or
*NL*
at
least
I
so
understood
him
--
that
the
chief
was
paddling
his
way
to
*NL*
the
realms
of
bliss
,
and
bread-fruit
--
the
Polynesian
heaven
--
where
*NL*
every
moment
the
bread-fruit
trees
dropped
their
ripened
spheres
to
the
*NL*
ground
,
and
where
there
was
no
end
to
the
cocoanuts
and
bananas
:
there
*NL*
they
reposed
through
the
livelong
eternity
upon
mats
much
finer
than
*NL*
those
of
Typee
;
and
every
day
bathed
their
glowing
limbs
in
rivers
*NL*
of
cocoanut
oil
.
In
that
happy
land
there
were
plenty
of
plumes
and
*NL*
feathers
,
and
boars
'
-
tusks
and
sperm-whale
teeth
,
far
preferable
to
all
*NL*
the
shining
trinkets
and
gay
tappa
of
the
white
men
;
and
,
best
of
all
,
*NL*
women
far
lovelier
than
the
daughters
of
earth
were
there
in
abundance
.
*NL*
'
A
very
pleasant
place
,
'
Kory-Kory
said
it
was
;
`
but
after
all
,
not
much
*NL*
pleasanter
,
he
thought
,
than
Typee
.
'
`
Did
he
not
then
,
'
I
asked
him
,
*NL*
`
wish
to
accompany
the
warrior
?
'
`
Oh
no
:
he
was
very
happy
where
he
was
;
*NL*
but
supposed
that
some
time
or
other
he
would
go
in
his
own
canoe
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
far
,
I
think
,
I
clearly
comprehended
Kory-Kory
.
But
there
was
a
*NL*
singular
expression
he
made
use
of
at
the
time
,
enforced
by
as
singular
*NL*
a
gesture
,
the
meaning
of
which
I
would
have
given
much
to
penetrate
.
*NL*
I
am
inclined
to
believe
it
must
have
been
a
proverb
he
uttered
;
for
I
*NL*
afterwards
heard
him
repeat
the
same
words
several
times
,
and
in
what
*NL*
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
somewhat
:
similar
sense
.
Indeed
,
Kory-Kory
had
*NL*
a
great
variety
of
short
,
smart-sounding
sentences
,
with
which
he
*NL*
frequently
enlivened
his
discourse
;
and
he
introduced
them
with
an
air
*NL*
which
plainly
intimated
,
that
in
his
opinion
,
they
settled
the
matter
in
*NL*
question
,
whatever
it
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Could
it
have
been
then
,
that
when
I
asked
him
whether
he
desired
to
go
*NL*
to
this
heaven
of
bread-fruit
,
cocoanuts
,
and
young
ladies
,
which
he
had
*NL*
been
describing
,
he
answered
by
saying
something
equivalent
to
our
*NL*
old
adage
--
'
A
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
'
?
--
if
he
did
,
*NL*
Kory-Kory
was
a
discreet
and
sensible
fellow
,
and
I
can
not
sufficiently
*NL*
admire
his
shrewdness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
,
in
the
course
of
my
rambles
through
the
valley
I
happened
to
*NL*
be
near
the
chief
's
mausoleum
,
I
always
turned
aside
to
visit
it
.
The
*NL*
place
had
a
peculiar
charm
for
me
;
I
hardly
know
why
,
but
so
it
was
.
As
*NL*
I
leaned
over
the
railing
and
gazed
upon
the
strange
effigy
and
watched
*NL*
the
play
of
the
feathery
head-dress
,
stirred
by
the
same
breeze
which
in
*NL*
low
tones
breathed
amidst
the
lofty
palm-trees
,
I
loved
to
yield
myself
*NL*
up
to
the
fanciful
superstition
of
the
islanders
,
and
could
almost
*NL*
believe
that
the
grim
warrior
was
bound
heavenward
.
In
this
mood
when
*NL*
I
turned
to
depart
,
I
bade
him
`
God
speed
,
and
a
pleasant
voyage
.
'
Aye
,
*NL*
paddle
away
,
brave
chieftain
,
to
the
land
of
spirits
!
To
the
material
*NL*
eye
thou
makest
but
little
progress
;
but
with
the
eye
of
faith
,
I
see
*NL*
thy
canoe
cleaving
the
bright
waves
,
which
die
away
on
those
dimly
*NL*
looming
shores
of
Paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
strange
superstition
affords
another
evidence
of
the
fact
,
that
*NL*
however
ignorant
man
may
be
,
he
still
feels
within
him
his
immortal
*NL*
spirit
yearning
,
after
the
unknown
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
the
religious
theories
of
the
islands
were
a
complete
mystery
*NL*
to
me
,
their
practical
every-day
operation
could
not
be
concealed
.
I
*NL*
frequently
passed
the
little
temples
reposing
in
the
shadows
of
the
*NL*
taboo
groves
and
beheld
the
offerings
--
mouldy
fruit
spread
out
upon
*NL*
a
rude
altar
,
or
hanging
in
half-decayed
baskets
around
some
uncouth
*NL*
jolly-looking
image
;
I
was
present
during
the
continuance
of
the
*NL*
festival
;
I
daily
beheld
the
grinning
idols
marshalled
rank
and
file
in
*NL*
the
Hoolah
Hoolah
ground
,
and
was
often
in
the
habit
of
meeting
*NL*
those
whom
I
supposed
to
be
the
priests
.
But
the
temples
seemed
to
be
*NL*
abandoned
to
solitude
;
the
festival
had
been
nothing
more
than
a
jovial
*NL*
mingling
of
the
tribe
;
the
idols
were
quite
harmless
as
any
other
logs
*NL*
of
wood
;
and
the
priests
were
the
merriest
dogs
in
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
religious
affairs
in
Typee
were
at
a
very
low
ebb
:
all
such
*NL*
matters
sat
very
lightly
upon
the
thoughtless
inhabitants
;
and
,
in
the
*NL*
celebration
of
many
of
their
strange
rites
,
they
appeared
merely
to
seek
*NL*
a
sort
of
childish
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
curious
evidence
of
this
was
given
in
a
remarkable
ceremony
in
which
I
*NL*
frequently
saw
Mehevi
and
several
other
chefs
and
warriors
of
note
take
*NL*
part
;
but
never
a
single
female
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
those
whom
I
looked
upon
as
forming
the
priesthood
of
the
valley
,
*NL*
there
was
one
in
particular
who
often
attracted
my
notice
,
and
whom
*NL*
I
could
not
help
regarding
as
the
head
of
the
order
.
He
was
a
noble
*NL*
looking
man
,
in
the
prime
of
his
life
,
and
of
a
most
benignant
aspect
.
*NL*
The
authority
this
man
,
whose
name
was
Kolory
,
seemed
to
exercise
over
*NL*
the
rest
,
the
episcopal
part
he
took
in
the
Feast
of
Calabashes
,
his
*NL*
sleek
and
complacent
appearance
,
the
mystic
characters
which
were
*NL*
tattooed
upon
his
chest
,
and
above
all
the
mitre
he
frequently
wore
,
*NL*
in
the
shape
of
a
towering
head-dress
,
consisting
of
part
of
a
cocoanut
*NL*
branch
,
the
stalk
planted
uprightly
on
his
brow
,
and
the
leaflets
*NL*
gathered
together
and
passed
round
the
temples
and
behind
the
ears
,
all
*NL*
these
pointed
him
out
as
Lord
Primate
of
Typee
.
Kolory
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
Knight
Templar
--
a
soldier-priest
;
for
he
often
wore
the
dress
of
a
*NL*
Marquesan
warrior
,
and
always
carried
a
long
spear
,
which
,
instead
of
*NL*
terminating
in
a
paddle
at
the
lower
end
,
after
the
general
fashion
of
*NL*
these
weapons
,
was
curved
into
a
heathenish-looking
little
image
.
This
*NL*
instrument
,
however
,
might
perhaps
have
been
emblematic
of
his
double
*NL*
functions
.
With
one
end
in
carnal
combat
he
transfixed
the
enemies
of
*NL*
his
tribe
;
and
with
the
other
as
a
pastoral
crook
he
kept
in
order
his
*NL*
spiritual
flock
.
But
this
is
not
all
I
have
to
say
about
Kolory
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
martial
grace
very
often
carried
about
with
him
what
seemed
to
me
*NL*
the
half
of
a
broken
war-club
.
It
was
swathed
round
with
ragged
bits
of
*NL*
white
tappa
,
and
the
upper
part
,
which
was
intended
to
represent
a
*NL*
human
head
,
was
embellished
with
a
strip
of
scarlet
cloth
of
European
*NL*
manufacture
.
It
required
little
observation
to
discover
that
this
*NL*
strange
object
was
revered
as
a
god
.
By
the
side
of
the
big
and
lusty
*NL*
images
standing
sentinel
over
the
altars
of
the
Hoolah
Hoolah
ground
,
it
*NL*
seemed
a
mere
pigmy
in
tatters
.
But
appearances
all
the
world
over
are
*NL*
deceptive
.
Little
men
are
sometimes
very
potent
,
and
rags
sometimes
*NL*
cover
very
extensive
pretensions
.
In
fact
,
this
funny
little
image
was
*NL*
the
`
crack
'
god
of
the
island
;
lording
it
over
all
the
wooden
lubbers
*NL*
who
looked
so
grim
and
dreadful
;
its
name
was
Moa
Artua
*
.
And
it
was
in
*NL*
honour
of
Moa
Artua
,
and
for
the
entertainment
of
those
who
believe
in
*NL*
him
,
that
the
curious
ceremony
I
am
about
to
describe
was
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
word
`
Artua
'
,
although
having
some
other
significations
,
is
in
*NL*
nearly
all
the
Polynesian
dialects
used
as
the
general
designation
of
*NL*
the
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mehevi
and
the
chieftains
of
the
Ti
have
just
risen
from
their
noontide
*NL*
slumbers
.
There
are
no
affairs
of
state
to
dispose
of
;
and
having
eaten
*NL*
two
or
three
breakfasts
in
the
course
of
the
morning
,
the
magnates
of
*NL*
the
valley
feel
no
appetite
as
yet
for
dinner
.
How
are
their
leisure
*NL*
moments
to
be
occupied
?
They
smoke
,
they
chat
,
and
at
last
one
of
their
*NL*
number
makes
a
proposition
to
the
rest
,
who
joyfully
acquiescing
,
he
*NL*
darts
out
of
the
house
,
leaps
from
the
pi-pi
,
and
disappears
in
the
*NL*
grove
.
Soon
you
see
him
returning
with
Kolory
,
who
bears
the
god
Moa
*NL*
Artua
in
his
arms
,
and
carries
in
one
hand
a
small
trough
,
hollowed
out
*NL*
in
the
likeness
of
a
canoe
.
The
priest
comes
along
dandling
his
charge
*NL*
as
if
it
were
a
lachrymose
infant
he
was
endeavouring
to
put
into
a
*NL*
good
humour
.
Presently
entering
the
Ti
,
he
seats
himself
on
the
mats
as
*NL*
composedly
as
a
juggler
about
to
perform
his
sleight-of-hand
tricks
;
and
*NL*
with
the
chiefs
disposed
in
a
circle
around
him
,
commences
his
ceremony
.
*NL*
In
the
first
place
he
gives
Moa
Artua
an
affectionate
hug
,
then
*NL*
caressingly
lays
him
to
his
breast
,
and
,
finally
,
whispers
something
in
*NL*
his
ear
;
the
rest
of
the
company
listening
eagerly
for
a
reply
.
But
*NL*
the
baby-god
is
deaf
or
dumb
,
--
perhaps
both
,
for
never
a
word
does
,
he
*NL*
utter
.
At
last
Kolory
speaks
a
little
louder
,
and
soon
growing
angry
,
*NL*
comes
boldly
out
with
what
he
has
to
say
and
bawls
to
him
.
He
put
me
in
*NL*
mind
of
a
choleric
fellow
,
who
,
after
trying
in
vain
to
communicated
a
*NL*
secret
to
a
deaf
man
,
all
at
once
flies
into
a
passion
and
screams
it
*NL*
out
so
that
every
one
may
hear
.
Still
Moa
Artua
remains
as
quiet
as
*NL*
ever
;
and
Kolory
,
seemingly
losing
his
temper
,
fetches
him
a
box
over
*NL*
the
head
,
strips
him
of
his
tappa
and
red
cloth
,
and
laying
him
in
*NL*
a
state
of
nudity
in
a
little
trough
,
covers
him
from
sight
.
At
this
*NL*
proceeding
all
present
loudly
applaud
and
signify
their
approval
by
*NL*
uttering
the
adjective
`
motarkee
'
with
violent
emphasis
.
Kolory
however
,
*NL*
is
so
desirous
his
conduct
should
meet
with
unqualified
approbation
,
*NL*
that
he
inquires
of
each
individual
separately
whether
under
existing
*NL*
circumstances
he
has
not
done
perfectly
right
in
shutting
up
Moa
Artua
.
*NL*
The
invariable
response
is
`
Aa
,
Aa
'
-LRB-
yes
,
yes
-RRB-
,
repeated
over
again
*NL*
and
again
in
a
manner
which
ought
to
quiet
the
scruples
of
the
most
*NL*
conscientious
.
After
a
few
moments
Kolory
brings
forth
his
doll
again
,
*NL*
and
while
arraying
it
very
carefully
in
the
tappa
and
red
cloth
,
*NL*
alternately
fondles
and
chides
it
.
The
toilet
being
completed
,
he
once
*NL*
more
speaks
to
it
aloud
.
The
whole
company
hereupon
show
the
greatest
*NL*
interest
;
while
the
priest
holding
Moa
Artua
to
his
ear
interprets
to
*NL*
them
what
he
pretends
the
god
is
confidentially
communicating
to
him
.
*NL*
Some
items
intelligence
appear
to
tickle
all
present
amazingly
;
for
one
*NL*
claps
his
hands
in
a
rapture
;
another
shouts
with
merriment
;
and
a
third
*NL*
leaps
to
his
feet
and
capers
about
like
a
madman
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
under
the
sun
Moa
Artua
on
these
occasions
had
to
say
to
Kolory
*NL*
I
never
could
find
out
;
but
I
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
former
*NL*
showed
a
sad
want
of
spirit
in
being
disciplined
into
making
those
*NL*
disclosures
,
which
at
first
he
seemed
bent
on
withholding
.
Whether
the
*NL*
priest
honestly
interpreted
what
he
believed
the
divinity
said
to
him
,
*NL*
or
whether
he
was
not
all
the
while
guilty
of
a
vile
humbug
,
I
shall
*NL*
not
presume
to
decide
.
At
any
rate
,
whatever
as
coming
from
the
god
*NL*
was
imparted
to
those
present
seemed
to
be
generally
of
a
complimentary
*NL*
nature
:
a
fact
which
illustrates
the
sagacity
of
Kolory
,
or
else
the
*NL*
timeserving
disposition
of
this
hardly
used
deity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moa
Artua
having
nothing
more
to
say
,
his
bearer
goes
to
nursing
*NL*
him
again
,
in
which
occupation
,
however
,
he
is
soon
interrupted
by
a
*NL*
question
put
by
one
of
the
warriors
to
the
god
.
Kolory
hereupon
snatches
*NL*
it
up
to
his
ear
again
,
and
after
listening
attentively
,
once
more
*NL*
officiates
as
the
organ
of
communication
.
A
multitude
of
questions
and
*NL*
answers
having
passed
between
the
parties
,
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
*NL*
those
who
propose
them
,
the
god
is
put
tenderly
to
bed
in
the
trough
,
*NL*
and
the
whole
company
unite
in
a
long
chant
,
led
off
by
Kolory
.
This
*NL*
ended
,
the
ceremony
is
over
;
the
chiefs
rise
to
their
feet
in
high
good
*NL*
humour
,
and
my
Lord
Archbishop
,
after
chatting
awhile
,
and
regaling
*NL*
himself
with
a
whiff
or
two
from
a
pipe
of
tobacco
,
tucks
the
canoe
*NL*
under
his
arm
and
marches
off
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
these
proceedings
were
like
those
of
a
parcel
of
children
*NL*
playing
with
dolls
and
baby
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
youngster
scarcely
ten
inches
high
,
and
with
so
few
early
*NL*
advantages
as
he
doubtless
had
had
,
Moa
Artua
was
certainly
a
precocious
*NL*
little
fellow
if
he
really
said
all
that
was
imputed
to
him
;
but
for
*NL*
what
reason
this
poor
devil
of
a
deity
,
thus
cuffed
about
,
cajoled
,
and
*NL*
shut
up
in
a
box
,
was
held
in
greater
estimation
than
the
full-grown
*NL*
and
dignified
personages
of
the
Taboo
Groves
,
I
can
not
divine
.
And
yet
*NL*
Mehevi
,
and
other
chiefs
of
unquestionable
veracity
--
to
say
nothing
of
*NL*
the
Primate
himself
--
assured
me
over
and
over
again
that
Moa
Artua
was
*NL*
the
tutelary
deity
of
Typee
,
and
was
more
to
be
held
in
honour
than
a
*NL*
whole
battalion
of
the
clumsy
idols
in
the
Hoolah
Hoolah
grounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kory-Kory
--
who
seemed
to
have
devoted
considerable
attention
to
the
*NL*
study
of
theology
,
as
he
knew
the
names
of
all
the
graven
images
in
the
*NL*
valley
,
and
often
repeated
them
over
to
me
--
likewise
entertained
some
*NL*
rather
enlarged
ideas
with
regard
to
the
character
and
pretensions
of
*NL*
Moa
Artua
.
He
once
gave
me
to
understand
,
with
a
gesture
there
was
no
*NL*
misconceiving
,
that
if
he
-LRB-
Moa
Artua
-RRB-
were
so
minded
he
could
cause
a
*NL*
cocoanut
tree
to
sprout
out
of
his
-LRB-
Kory-Kory
's
-RRB-
head
;
and
that
it
*NL*
would
be
the
easiest
thing
in
life
for
him
-LRB-
Moa
Artua
-RRB-
to
take
the
whole
*NL*
island
of
Nukuheva
in
his
mouth
and
dive
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
*NL*
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
sober
seriousness
,
I
hardly
knew
what
to
make
of
the
religion
*NL*
of
the
valley
.
There
was
nothing
that
so
much
perplexed
the
illustrious
*NL*
Cook
,
in
his
intercourse
with
the
South
Sea
islanders
,
as
their
sacred
*NL*
rites
.
Although
this
prince
of
navigators
was
in
many
instances
assisted
*NL*
by
interpreters
in
the
prosecution
of
his
researches
,
he
still
frankly
*NL*
acknowledges
that
he
was
at
a
loss
to
obtain
anything
like
a
clear
*NL*
insight
into
the
puzzling
arcana
of
their
faith
.
A
similar
admission
has
*NL*
been
made
by
other
eminent
voyagers
:
by
Carteret
,
Byron
,
Kotzebue
,
and
*NL*
Vancouver
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
although
hardly
a
day
passed
while
I
remained
upon
the
*NL*
island
that
I
did
not
witness
some
religious
ceremony
or
other
,
it
was
*NL*
very
much
like
seeing
a
parcel
of
`
Freemasons
'
making
secret
signs
to
*NL*
each
other
;
I
saw
everything
,
but
could
comprehend
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
whole
,
I
am
inclined
to
believe
,
that
the
islanders
in
the
*NL*
Pacific
have
no
fixed
and
definite
ideas
whatever
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
religion
.
I
am
persuaded
that
Kolory
himself
would
be
effectually
posed
*NL*
were
he
called
upon
to
draw
up
the
articles
of
his
faith
and
pronounce
*NL*
the
creed
by
which
he
hoped
to
be
saved
.
In
truth
,
the
Typees
,
so
far
*NL*
as
their
actions
evince
,
submitted
to
no
laws
human
or
divine
--
always
*NL*
excepting
the
thrice
mysterious
Taboo
.
The
`
independent
electors
'
of
the
*NL*
valley
were
not
to
be
brow-beaten
by
chiefs
,
priests
,
idol
or
devils
.
*NL*
As
for
the
luckless
idols
,
they
received
more
hard
knocks
than
*NL*
supplications
.
I
do
not
wonder
that
some
of
them
looked
so
grim
,
and
*NL*
stood
so
bolt
upright
as
if
fearful
of
looking
to
the
right
or
the
left
*NL*
lest
they
should
give
any
one
offence
.
The
fact
is
,
they
had
to
*NL*
carry
themselves
`
PRETTY
STRAIGHT
,
'
or
suffer
the
consequences
.
Their
*NL*
worshippers
were
such
a
precious
set
of
fickle-minded
and
irreverent
*NL*
heathens
,
that
there
was
no
telling
when
they
might
topple
one
of
them
*NL*
over
,
break
it
to
pieces
,
and
making
a
fire
with
it
on
the
very
altar
*NL*
itself
,
fall
to
roasting
the
offerings
of
bread-fruit
,
and
at
them
in
*NL*
spite
of
its
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
how
little
reverence
these
unfortunate
deities
were
held
by
the
*NL*
natives
was
on
one
occasion
most
convincingly
proved
to
me
.
--
Walking
*NL*
with
Kory-Kory
through
the
deepest
recesses
of
the
groves
,
I
perceived
*NL*
a
curious
looking
image
,
about
six
feet
in
height
which
originally
had
*NL*
been
placed
upright
against
a
low
pi-pi
,
surmounted
by
a
ruinous
bamboo
*NL*
temple
,
but
having
become
fatigued
and
weak
in
the
knees
,
was
now
*NL*
carelessly
leaning
against
it
.
The
idol
was
partly
concealed
by
the
*NL*
foliage
of
a
tree
which
stood
near
,
and
whose
leafy
boughs
drooped
over
*NL*
the
pile
of
stones
,
as
if
to
protect
the
rude
fane
from
the
decay
to
*NL*
which
it
was
rapidly
hastening
.
The
image
itself
was
nothing
more
than
*NL*
a
grotesquely
shaped
log
,
carved
in
the
likeness
of
a
portly
naked
man
*NL*
with
the
arms
clasped
over
the
head
,
the
jaws
thrown
wide
apart
,
and
its
*NL*
thick
shapeless
legs
bowed
into
an
arch
.
It
was
much
decayed
.
The
*NL*
lower
part
was
overgrown
with
a
bright
silky
moss
.
Thin
spears
of
grass
*NL*
sprouted
from
the
distended
mouth
,
and
fringed
the
outline
of
the
head
*NL*
and
arms
.
His
godship
had
literally
attained
a
green
old
age
.
All
its
*NL*
prominent
points
were
bruised
and
battered
,
or
entirely
rotted
away
.
*NL*
The
nose
had
taken
its
departure
,
and
from
the
general
appearance
of
the
*NL*
head
it
might
have
,
been
supposed
that
the
wooden
divinity
,
in
despair
*NL*
at
the
neglect
of
its
worshippers
,
had
been
trying
to
beat
its
own
*NL*
brains
out
against
the
surrounding
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
drew
near
to
inspect
more
closely
this
strange
object
of
idolatry
,
but
*NL*
halted
reverently
at
the
distance
of
two
or
three
paces
,
out
of
regard
*NL*
to
the
religious
prejudices
of
my
valet
.
As
soon
,
however
,
as
Kory-Kory
*NL*
perceived
that
I
was
in
one
of
my
inquiring
,
scientific
moods
,
to
my
*NL*
astonishment
,
he
sprang
to
the
side
of
the
idol
,
and
pushing
it
away
*NL*
from
the
stones
against
which
it
rested
,
endeavoured
to
make
it
stand
*NL*
upon
its
legs
.
But
the
divinity
had
lost
the
use
of
them
altogether
;
and
*NL*
while
Kory-Kory
was
trying
to
prop
it
up
,
placing
a
stick
between
it
*NL*
and
the
pi-pi
,
the
monster
fell
clumsily
to
the
ground
,
and
would
have
*NL*
infallibly
have
broken
its
neck
had
not
Kory-Kory
providentially
broken
*NL*
its
fall
by
receiving
its
whole
weight
on
his
own
half-crushed
back
.
I
*NL*
never
saw
the
honest
fellow
in
such
a
rage
before
.
He
leaped
furiously
*NL*
to
his
feet
,
and
seizing
the
stick
,
began
beating
the
poor
image
:
every
*NL*
moment
,
or
two
pausing
and
talking
to
it
in
the
most
violent
manner
,
as
*NL*
if
upbraiding
it
for
the
accident
.
When
his
indignation
had
subsided
*NL*
a
little
he
whirled
the
idol
about
most
profanely
,
so
as
to
give
me
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
examining
it
on
all
sides
.
I
am
quite
sure
I
never
should
*NL*
have
presumed
to
have
taken
such
liberties
with
the
god
myself
,
and
I
*NL*
was
not
a
little
shocked
at
Kory-Kory
's
impiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
anecdote
speaks
for
itself
.
When
one
of
the
inferior
order
of
*NL*
natives
could
show
such
contempt
for
a
venerable
and
decrepit
God
of
the
*NL*
Groves
,
what
the
state
of
religion
must
be
among
the
people
in
general
*NL*
is
easy
to
be
imagined
.
In
truth
,
I
regard
the
Typees
as
a
back-slidden
*NL*
generation
.
They
are
sunk
in
religious
sloth
,
and
require
a
spiritual
*NL*
revival
.
A
long
prosperity
of
bread-fruit
and
cocoanuts
has
rendered
*NL*
them
remiss
in
the
performance
of
their
higher
obligations
.
The
wood-rot
*NL*
malady
is
spreading
among
the
idols
--
the
fruit
upon
their
altars
*NL*
is
becoming
offensive
--
the
temples
themselves
need
rethatching
--
the
*NL*
tattooed
clergy
are
altogether
too
light-hearted
and
lazy
--
and
their
*NL*
flocks
are
going
astray
.

ALTHOUGH
I
had
been
unable
during
the
late
festival
to
obtain
*NL*
information
on
many
interesting
subjects
which
had
much
excited
my
*NL*
curiosity
,
still
that
important
event
had
not
passed
by
without
adding
*NL*
materially
to
my
general
knowledge
of
the
islanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
especially
struck
by
the
physical
strength
and
beauty
which
*NL*
they
displayed
,
by
their
great
superiority
in
these
respects
over
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
the
neighbouring
bay
of
Nukuheva
,
and
by
the
singular
*NL*
contrasts
they
presented
among
themselves
in
their
various
shades
of
*NL*
complexion
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
beauty
of
form
they
surpassed
anything
I
had
ever
seen
.
Not
a
single
*NL*
instance
of
natural
deformity
was
observable
in
all
the
throng
attending
*NL*
the
revels
.
Occasionally
I
noticed
among
the
men
the
scars
of
wounds
*NL*
they
had
received
in
battle
;
and
sometimes
,
though
very
seldom
,
the
loss
*NL*
of
a
finger
,
an
eye
,
or
an
arm
,
attributable
to
the
same
cause
.
With
*NL*
these
exceptions
,
every
individual
appeared
free
from
those
blemishes
*NL*
which
sometimes
mar
the
effect
of
an
otherwise
perfect
form
.
But
their
*NL*
physical
excellence
did
not
merely
consist
in
an
exemption
from
these
*NL*
evils
;
nearly
every
individual
of
their
number
might
have
been
taken
for
*NL*
a
sculptor
's
model
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
remembered
that
these
islanders
derived
no
advantage
from
dress
,
*NL*
but
appeared
in
all
the
naked
simplicity
of
nature
,
I
could
not
avoid
*NL*
comparing
them
with
the
fine
gentlemen
and
dandies
who
promenade
such
*NL*
unexceptionable
figures
in
our
frequented
thoroughfares
.
Stripped
of
*NL*
the
cunning
artifices
of
the
tailor
,
and
standing
forth
in
the
garb
*NL*
of
Eden
--
what
a
sorry
,
set
of
round-shouldered
,
spindle-shanked
,
*NL*
crane-necked
varlets
would
civilized
men
appear
!
Stuffed
calves
,
*NL*
padded
breasts
,
and
scientifically
cut
pantaloons
would
then
avail
them
*NL*
nothing
,
and
the
effect
would
be
truly
deplorable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
in
the
appearance
of
the
islanders
struck
me
more
forcibly
*NL*
than
the
whiteness
of
their
teeth
.
The
novelist
always
compares
the
*NL*
masticators
of
his
heroine
to
ivory
;
but
I
boldly
pronounce
the
teeth
*NL*
of
the
Typee
to
be
far
more
beautiful
than
ivory
itself
.
The
jaws
of
the
*NL*
oldest
graybeards
among
them
were
much
better
garnished
than
those
of
*NL*
most
of
the
youths
of
civilized
countries
;
while
the
teeth
of
the
young
*NL*
and
middle-aged
,
in
their
purity
and
whiteness
,
were
actually
dazzling
*NL*
to
the
eye
.
Their
marvellous
whiteness
of
the
teeth
is
to
be
ascribed
*NL*
to
the
pure
vegetable
diet
of
these
people
,
and
the
uninterrupted
*NL*
healthfulness
of
their
natural
mode
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
,
in
almost
every
instance
,
are
of
lofty
stature
,
scarcely
*NL*
ever
less
than
six
feet
in
height
,
while
the
other
sex
are
uncommonly
*NL*
diminutive
.
The
early
period
of
life
at
which
the
human
form
arrives
*NL*
at
maturity
in
this
generous
tropical
climate
,
likewise
deserves
to
be
*NL*
mentioned
.
A
little
creature
,
not
more
than
thirteen
years
of
age
,
and
*NL*
who
in
other
particulars
might
be
regarded
as
a
mere
child
,
is
often
*NL*
seen
nursing
her
own
baby
,
whilst
lads
who
,
under
less
ripening
skies
,
*NL*
would
be
still
at
school
,
are
here
responsible
fathers
of
families
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
first
entering
the
Typee
Valley
,
I
had
been
struck
with
the
marked
*NL*
contrast
presented
by
its
inhabitants
with
those
of
the
bay
I
had
*NL*
previously
left
.
In
the
latter
place
,
I
had
not
been
favourably
*NL*
impressed
with
the
personal
appearance
of
the
male
portion
of
the
*NL*
population
;
although
with
the
females
,
excepting
in
some
truly
*NL*
melancholy
instances
,
I
had
been
wonderfully
pleased
.
I
had
observed
*NL*
that
even
the
little
intercourse
Europeans
had
carried
on
with
the
*NL*
Nukuheva
natives
had
not
failed
to
leave
its
traces
amongst
them
.
One
of
*NL*
the
most
dreadful
curses
under
which
humanity
labours
had
commenced
its
*NL*
havocks
,
and
betrayed
,
as
it
ever
does
among
the
South
Sea
islanders
,
*NL*
the
most
aggravated
symptoms
.
From
this
,
as
from
all
other
foreign
*NL*
inflictions
,
the
yet
uncontaminated
tenants
of
the
Typee
Valley
were
*NL*
wholly
exempt
;
and
long
may
they
continue
so
.
Better
will
it
be
for
them
*NL*
for
ever
to
remain
the
happy
and
innocent
heathens
and
barbarians
*NL*
that
they
now
are
,
than
,
like
the
wretched
inhabitants
of
the
Sandwich
*NL*
Islands
,
to
enjoy
the
mere
name
of
Christians
without
experiencing
any
*NL*
of
the
vital
operations
of
true
religion
,
whilst
,
at
the
same
time
,
they
*NL*
are
made
the
victims
of
the
worst
vices
and
evils
of
civilized
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apart
,
however
,
from
these
considerations
,
I
am
inclined
to
believe
that
*NL*
there
exists
a
radical
difference
between
the
two
tribes
,
if
indeed
*NL*
they
are
not
distinct
races
of
men
.
To
those
who
have
merely
touched
at
*NL*
Nukuheva
Bay
,
without
visiting
other
portions
of
the
island
,
it
would
*NL*
hardly
appear
credible
the
diversities
presented
between
the
various
*NL*
small
clans
inhabiting
so
diminutive
a
spot
.
But
the
hereditary
*NL*
hostility
which
has
existed
between
them
for
ages
,
fully
accounts
for
*NL*
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
so
easy
,
however
,
is
it
to
assign
an
adequate
cause
for
the
endless
*NL*
variety
of
complexions
to
be
seen
in
the
Typee
Valley
.
During
the
*NL*
festival
,
I
had
noticed
several
young
females
whose
skins
were
almost
as
*NL*
white
as
any
Saxon
damsel
's
;
a
slight
dash
of
the
mantling
brown
being
*NL*
all
that
marked
the
difference
.
This
comparative
fairness
of
complexion
,
*NL*
though
in
a
great
degree
perfectly
natural
,
is
partly
the
result
of
an
*NL*
artificial
process
,
and
of
an
entire
exclusion
from
the
sun
.
The
juice
*NL*
of
the
`
papa
'
root
found
in
great
abundance
at
the
head
of
the
valley
,
*NL*
is
held
in
great
esteem
as
a
cosmetic
,
with
which
many
of
the
females
*NL*
daily
anoint
their
whole
person
.
The
habitual
use
of
it
whitens
and
*NL*
beautifies
the
skin
.
Those
of
the
young
girls
who
resort
to
this
method
*NL*
of
heightening
their
charms
,
never
expose
themselves
selves
to
the
*NL*
rays
of
the
sun
;
an
observance
,
however
,
that
produces
little
or
no
*NL*
inconvenience
,
since
there
are
but
few
of
the
inhabited
portions
of
the
*NL*
vale
which
are
not
shaded
over
with
a
spreading
canopy
of
boughs
,
so
*NL*
that
one
may
journey
from
house
to
house
,
scarcely
deviating
from
the
*NL*
direct
course
,
and
yet
never
once
see
his
shadow
cast
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
`
papa
'
,
when
used
,
is
suffered
to
remain
upon
the
skin
for
several
*NL*
hours
;
being
of
a
light
green
colour
,
it
consequently
imparts
for
*NL*
the
time
a
similar
hue
to
the
complexion
.
Nothing
,
therefore
,
can
be
*NL*
imagined
more
singular
than
the
appearance
of
these
nearly
naked
damsels
*NL*
immediately
after
the
application
of
the
cosmetic
.
To
look
at
one
of
*NL*
them
you
would
almost
suppose
she
was
some
vegetable
in
an
unripe
state
;
*NL*
and
that
,
instead
of
living
in
the
shade
for
ever
,
she
ought
to
be
*NL*
placed
out
in
the
sun
to
ripen
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
islanders
are
more
or
less
in
the
habit
of
anointing
themselves
;
*NL*
the
women
preferring
the
`
aker
'
to
`
papa
'
,
and
the
men
using
the
oil
*NL*
of
the
cocoanut
.
Mehevi
was
remarkable
fond
of
mollifying
his
entire
*NL*
cuticle
with
this
ointment
.
Sometimes
he
might
be
seen
,
with
his
whole
*NL*
body
fairly
reeking
with
the
perfumed
oil
of
the
nut
,
looking
as
if
he
*NL*
had
just
emerged
from
a
soap-boiler
's
vat
,
or
had
undergone
the
process
*NL*
of
dipping
in
a
tallow-chandlery
.
To
this
cause
perhaps
,
united
to
their
*NL*
frequent
bathing
and
extreme
cleanliness
,
is
ascribable
,
in
a
great
*NL*
measure
,
the
marvellous
purity
and
smoothness
of
skin
exhibited
by
the
*NL*
natives
in
general
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prevailing
tint
among
the
women
of
the
valley
was
a
light
olive
,
and
*NL*
of
this
style
of
complexion
Fayaway
afforded
the
most
beautiful
example
.
*NL*
Others
were
still
darker
;
while
not
a
few
were
of
a
genuine
golden
*NL*
colour
,
and
some
of
a
swarthy
hue
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
agreeing
with
much
previously
mentioned
in
this
narrative
I
may
*NL*
here
observe
that
Mendanna
,
their
discoverer
,
in
his
account
of
the
*NL*
Marquesas
,
described
the
natives
as
wondrously
beautiful
to
behold
,
and
*NL*
as
nearly
resembling
the
people
of
southern
Europe
.
The
first
of
these
*NL*
islands
seen
by
Mendanna
was
La
Madelena
,
which
is
not
far
distant
from
*NL*
Nukuheva
;
and
its
inhabitants
in
every
respect
resemble
those
dwelling
*NL*
on
that
and
the
other
islands
of
the
group
.
Figueroa
,
the
chronicler
of
*NL*
Mendanna
's
voyage
,
says
,
that
on
the
morning
the
land
was
descried
,
*NL*
when
the
Spaniards
drew
near
the
shore
,
there
sallied
forth
,
in
rude
*NL*
progression
,
about
seventy
canoes
,
and
at
the
same
time
many
of
the
*NL*
inhabitants
-LRB-
females
I
presume
-RRB-
made
towards
the
ships
by
swimming
.
He
*NL*
adds
,
that
`
in
complexion
they
were
nearly
white
;
of
good
stature
,
*NL*
and
finely
formed
;
and
on
their
faces
and
bodies
were
delineated
*NL*
representations
of
fishes
and
other
devices
'
.
The
old
Don
then
goes
on
*NL*
to
say
,
`
There
came
,
among
others
,
two
lads
paddling
their
canoe
,
whose
*NL*
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
ship
;
they
had
beautiful
faces
and
the
most
*NL*
promising
animation
of
countenance
;
and
were
in
all
things
so
becoming
,
*NL*
that
the
pilot-mayor
Quiros
affirmed
,
nothing
in
his
life
ever
caused
*NL*
him
so
much
regret
as
the
leaving
such
fine
creatures
to
be
lost
in
that
*NL*
country
.
'
*
More
than
two
hundred
years
have
gone
by
since
the
passage
of
*NL*
which
the
above
is
a
translation
was
written
;
and
it
appears
to
me
*NL*
now
,
as
I
read
it
,
as
fresh
and
true
as
if
written
but
yesterday
.
The
*NL*
islanders
are
still
the
same
;
and
I
have
seen
boys
in
the
Typee
Valley
*NL*
of
whose
`
beautiful
faces
'
and
promising
`
animation
of
countenance
'
no
*NL*
one
who
has
not
beheld
them
can
form
any
adequate
idea
.
Cook
,
in
the
*NL*
account
of
his
voyage
,
pronounces
the
Marquesans
as
by
far
the
most
*NL*
splendid
islanders
in
the
South
Seas
.
Stewart
,
the
chaplain
of
the
U.S.
*NL*
ship
Vincennes
,
in
his
`
Scenes
in
the
South
Seas
'
,
expresses
,
in
more
*NL*
than
one
place
,
his
amazement
at
the
surpassing
loveliness
of
the
women
;
*NL*
and
says
that
many
of
the
Nukuheva
damsels
reminded
him
forcibly
of
the
*NL*
most
celebrated
beauties
in
his
own
land
.
Fanning
,
a
Yankee
mariner
of
*NL*
some
reputation
,
likewise
records
his
lively
impressions
of
the
physical
*NL*
appearance
of
these
people
;
and
Commodore
David
Porter
of
the
U.S.
*NL*
frigate
Essex
,
is
said
to
have
been
vastly
smitten
by
the
beauty
of
the
*NL*
ladies
.
Their
great
superiority
over
all
other
Polynesians
can
not
fail
*NL*
to
attract
the
notice
of
those
who
visit
the
principal
groups
in
the
*NL*
Pacific
.
The
voluptuous
Tahitians
are
the
only
people
who
at
all
deserve
*NL*
to
be
compared
with
them
;
while
the
dark-haired
Hawaiians
and
*NL*
the
woolly-headed
Feejees
are
immeasurably
inferior
to
them
.
The
*NL*
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
Marquesan
islanders
,
and
that
*NL*
which
at
once
strikes
you
,
is
the
European
cast
of
their
features
--
a
*NL*
peculiarity
seldom
observable
among
other
uncivilized
people
.
Many
of
*NL*
their
faces
present
profiles
classically
beautiful
,
and
in
the
valley
of
*NL*
Typee
I
saw
several
who
,
like
the
stranger
Marnoo
,
were
in
every
respect
*NL*
models
of
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
This
passage
,
which
is
cited
as
an
almost
literal
translation
from
the
*NL*
original
,
I
found
in
a
small
volume
entitled
`
Circumnavigation
of
the
*NL*
Globe
,
in
which
volume
are
several
extracts
from
`
Dalrymple
's
Historical
*NL*
Collections
'
.
The
last-mentioned
work
I
have
never
seen
,
but
it
is
said
*NL*
to
contain
a
very
correct
English
version
of
great
part
of
the
learned
*NL*
Doctor
Christoval
Suaverde
da
Figueroa
's
History
of
Mendanna
's
Voyage
,
*NL*
published
at
Madrid
,
A.D.
1613
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
natives
present
at
the
Feast
of
Calabashes
had
displayed
a
*NL*
few
articles
of
European
dress
;
disposed
however
,
about
their
persons
*NL*
after
their
own
peculiar
fashion
.
Among
these
I
perceived
two
pieces
of
*NL*
cotton-cloth
which
poor
Toby
and
myself
had
bestowed
upon
our
youthful
*NL*
guides
the
afternoon
we
entered
the
valley
.
They
were
evidently
reserved
*NL*
for
gala
days
;
and
during
those
of
the
festival
they
rendered
the
young
*NL*
islanders
who
wore
them
very
distinguished
characters
.
The
small
number
*NL*
who
were
similarly
adorned
,
and
the
great
value
they
appeared
to
place
*NL*
upon
the
most
common
and
most
trivial
articles
,
furnished
ample
evidence
*NL*
of
the
very
restricted
intercourse
they
held
with
vessels
touching
at
*NL*
the
island
.
A
few
cotton
handkerchiefs
,
of
a
gay
pattern
,
tied
about
the
*NL*
neck
,
and
suffered
to
fall
over
the
shoulder
;
strips
of
fanciful
calico
,
*NL*
swathed
about
the
loins
,
were
nearly
all
I
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Indeed
,
throughout
the
valley
,
there
were
few
things
of
any
kind
to
*NL*
be
seen
of
European
origin
.
All
I
ever
saw
,
besides
the
articles
just
*NL*
alluded
to
,
were
the
six
muskets
preserved
in
the
Ti
,
and
three
or
four
*NL*
similar
implements
of
warfare
hung
up
in
other
houses
;
some
small
*NL*
canvas
bags
,
partly
filled
with
bullets
and
powder
,
and
half
a
dozen
old
*NL*
hatchet-heads
,
with
the
edges
blunted
and
battered
to
such
a
degree
*NL*
as
to
render
them
utterly
useless
.
These
last
seemed
to
be
regarded
as
*NL*
nearly
worthless
by
the
natives
;
and
several
times
they
held
up
,
one
*NL*
of
them
before
me
,
and
throwing
it
aside
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
,
*NL*
manifested
their
contempt
for
anything
that
could
so
soon
become
*NL*
unserviceable
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
muskets
,
the
powder
,
and
the
bullets
were
held
in
most
*NL*
extravagant
esteem
.
The
former
,
from
their
great
age
and
the
*NL*
peculiarities
they
exhibited
,
were
well
worthy
a
place
in
any
*NL*
antiquarian
's
armoury
.
I
remember
in
particular
one
that
hung
in
the
*NL*
Ti
,
and
which
Mehevi
--
supposing
as
a
matter
of
course
that
I
was
able
to
*NL*
repair
it
--
had
put
into
my
hands
for
that
purpose
.
It
was
one
of
those
*NL*
clumsy
,
old-fashioned
,
English
pieces
known
generally
as
Tower
Hill
*NL*
muskets
,
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
might
have
been
left
on
the
island
by
*NL*
Wallace
,
Carteret
,
Cook
,
or
Vancouver
.
The
stock
was
half
rotten
and
*NL*
worm-eaten
;
the
lock
was
as
rusty
and
about
as
well
adapted
to
its
*NL*
ostensible
purpose
as
an
old
door-hinge
;
the
threading
of
the
screws
*NL*
about
the
trigger
was
completely
worn
away
;
while
the
barrel
shook
in
*NL*
the
wood
.
Such
was
the
weapon
the
chief
desired
me
to
restore
to
its
*NL*
original
condition
.
As
I
did
not
possess
the
accomplishments
of
a
*NL*
gunsmith
,
and
was
likewise
destitute
of
the
necessary
tools
,
I
was
*NL*
reluctantly
obliged
to
signify
my
inability
to
perform
the
task
.
At
this
*NL*
unexpected
communication
Mehevi
regarded
me
,
for
a
moment
,
as
if
he
half
*NL*
suspected
I
was
some
inferior
sort
of
white
man
,
who
after
all
did
not
*NL*
know
much
more
than
a
Typee
.
However
,
after
a
most
laboured
explanation
*NL*
of
the
matter
,
I
succeeded
in
making
him
understand
the
extreme
*NL*
difficulty
of
the
task
.
Scarcely
satisfied
with
my
apologies
,
however
,
*NL*
he
marched
off
with
the
superannuated
musket
in
something
of
a
huff
,
as
*NL*
if
he
would
no
longer
expose
it
to
the
indignity
of
being
manipulated
by
*NL*
such
unskilful
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
festival
I
had
not
failed
to
remark
the
simplicity
of
manner
,
*NL*
the
freedom
from
all
restraint
,
and
,
to
certain
degree
,
the
equality
*NL*
of
condition
manifested
by
the
natives
in
general
.
No
one
appeared
to
*NL*
assume
any
arrogant
pretensions
.
There
was
little
more
than
a
slight
*NL*
difference
in
costume
to
distinguish
the
chiefs
from
the
other
natives
.
*NL*
All
appeared
to
mix
together
freely
,
and
without
any
reserve
;
although
*NL*
I
noticed
that
the
wishes
of
a
chief
,
even
when
delivered
in
the
mildest
*NL*
tone
,
received
the
same
immediate
obedience
which
elsewhere
would
have
*NL*
been
only
accorded
to
a
peremptory
command
.
What
may
be
the
extent
*NL*
of
the
authority
of
the
chiefs
over
the
rest
of
the
tribe
,
I
will
not
*NL*
venture
to
assert
;
but
from
all
I
saw
during
my
stay
in
the
valley
,
I
*NL*
was
induced
to
believe
that
in
matters
concerning
the
general
welfare
*NL*
it
was
very
limited
.
The
required
degree
of
deference
towards
them
,
*NL*
however
,
was
willingly
and
cheerfully
yielded
;
and
as
all
authority
is
*NL*
transmitted
from
father
to
son
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
one
of
the
effects
*NL*
here
,
as
elsewhere
,
of
high
birth
,
is
to
induce
respect
and
obedience
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
civil
institutions
of
the
Marquesas
Islands
appear
to
be
in
this
,
*NL*
as
in
other
respects
,
directly
the
reverse
of
those
of
the
Tahitian
and
*NL*
Hawaiian
groups
,
where
the
original
power
of
the
king
and
chiefs
was
far
*NL*
more
despotic
than
that
of
any
tyrant
in
civilized
countries
.
At
Tahiti
*NL*
it
used
to
be
death
for
one
of
the
inferior
orders
to
approach
,
without
*NL*
permission
,
under
the
shadow
,
of
the
king
's
house
;
or
to
fail
in
paying
*NL*
the
customary
reverence
when
food
destined
for
the
king
was
borne
past
*NL*
them
by
his
messengers
.
At
the
Sandwich
Islands
,
Kaahumanu
,
the
gigantic
*NL*
old
dowager
queen
--
a
woman
of
nearly
four
hundred
pounds
weight
,
and
*NL*
who
is
said
to
be
still
living
at
Mowee
--
was
accustomed
,
in
some
of
her
*NL*
terrific
gusts
of
temper
,
to
snatch
up
an
ordinary
sized
man
who
had
*NL*
offended
her
,
and
snap
his
spine
across
her
knee
.
Incredible
as
this
*NL*
may
seem
,
it
is
a
fact
.
While
at
Lahainaluna
--
the
residence
of
this
*NL*
monstrous
Jezebel
--
a
humpbacked
wretch
was
pointed
out
to
me
,
who
,
some
*NL*
twenty-five
years
previously
,
had
had
the
vertebrae
of
his
backbone
very
*NL*
seriously
discomposed
by
his
gentle
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
particular
grades
of
rank
existing
among
the
chiefs
of
Typee
,
I
*NL*
could
not
in
all
cases
determine
.
Previous
to
the
Feast
of
Calabashes
*NL*
I
had
been
puzzled
what
particular
station
to
assign
to
Mehevi
.
But
the
*NL*
important
part
he
took
upon
that
occasion
convinced
me
that
he
had
no
*NL*
superior
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
valley
.
I
had
invariably
noticed
a
*NL*
certain
degree
of
deference
paid
to
him
by
all
with
whom
I
had
ever
seen
*NL*
him
brought
in
contact
;
but
when
I
remembered
that
my
wanderings
had
*NL*
been
confined
to
a
limited
portion
of
the
valley
,
and
that
towards
*NL*
the
sea
a
number
of
distinguished
chiefs
resided
,
some
of
whom
had
*NL*
separately
visited
me
at
Marheyo
's
house
,
and
whom
,
until
the
Festival
,
*NL*
I
had
never
seen
in
the
company
of
Mehevi
,
I
felt
disposed
to
believe
*NL*
that
his
rank
after
all
might
not
be
particularly
elevated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
revels
,
however
,
had
brought
together
all
the
warriors
whom
I
had
*NL*
seen
individually
and
in
groups
at
different
times
and
places
.
Among
*NL*
them
Mehevi
moved
with
an
easy
air
of
superiority
which
was
not
to
be
*NL*
mistaken
;
and
he
whom
I
had
only
looked
at
as
the
hospitable
host
of
the
*NL*
Ti
,
and
one
of
the
military
leaders
of
the
tribe
,
now
assumed
in
my
eyes
*NL*
the
dignity
of
royal
station
.
His
striking
costume
,
no
less
than
his
*NL*
naturally
commanding
figure
,
seemed
indeed
to
give
him
pre-eminence
over
*NL*
the
rest
.
The
towering
helmet
of
feathers
that
he
wore
raised
him
*NL*
in
height
above
all
who
surrounded
him
;
and
though
some
others
were
*NL*
similarly
adorned
,
the
length
and
luxuriance
of
their
plumes
were
*NL*
inferior
to
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mehevi
was
in
fact
the
greatest
of
the
chiefs
--
the
head
of
his
clan
--
the
*NL*
sovereign
of
the
valley
;
and
the
simplicity
of
the
social
institutions
*NL*
of
the
people
could
not
have
been
more
completely
proved
than
by
the
*NL*
fact
,
that
after
having
been
several
weeks
in
the
valley
,
and
almost
in
*NL*
daily
intercourse
with
Mehevi
,
I
should
have
remained
until
the
time
of
*NL*
the
festival
ignorant
of
his
regal
character
.
But
a
new
light
had
now
*NL*
broken
in
upon
me
.
The
Ti
was
the
palace
--
and
Mehevi
the
king
.
Both
the
*NL*
one
and
the
other
of
a
most
simple
and
patriarchal
nature
:
it
must
be
*NL*
allowed
,
and
wholly
unattended
by
the
ceremonious
pomp
which
usually
*NL*
surrounds
the
purple
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
having
made
this
discovery
I
could
not
avoid
congratulating
myself
*NL*
that
Mehevi
had
from
the
first
taken
me
as
it
were
under
his
royal
*NL*
protection
,
and
that
he
still
continued
to
entertain
for
me
the
warmest
*NL*
regard
,
as
far
at
least
as
I
was
enabled
to
judge
from
appearances
.
For
*NL*
the
future
I
determined
to
pay
most
assiduous
court
to
him
,
hoping
that
*NL*
eventually
through
his
kindness
I
might
obtain
my
liberty
.

KING

--
A

sounding
title
--
and
why
should
I
not
bestow
*NL*
it
upon
the
foremost
man
in
the
valley
of
Typee
?
The
republican
*NL*
missionaries
of
Oahu
cause
to
be
gazetted
in
the
Court
Journal
,
*NL*
published
at
Honolulu
,
the
most
trivial
movement
of
`
his
gracious
*NL*
majesty
'
King
Kammehammaha
III
,
and
`
their
highnesses
the
princes
of
the
*NL*
blood
royal
'
.
*
And
who
is
his
`
gracious
majesty
'
,
and
what
the
*NL*
quality
of
this
blood
royal
'
?
--
His
`
gracious
majesty
'
is
a
fat
,
lazy
,
*NL*
negro-looking
blockhead
,
with
as
little
character
as
power
.
He
has
*NL*
lost
the
noble
traits
of
the
barbarian
,
without
acquiring
the
redeeming
*NL*
graces
of
a
civilized
being
;
and
,
although
a
member
of
the
Hawiian
*NL*
Temperance
Society
,
is
a
most
inveterate
dram-drinker
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
Accounts
like
these
are
sometimes
copied
into
English
and
American
*NL*
journals
.
They
lead
the
reader
to
infer
that
the
arts
and
customs
of
*NL*
civilized
life
are
rapidly
refining
the
natives
of
the
Sandwich
Islands
.
*NL*
But
let
no
one
be
deceived
by
these
accounts
.
The
chiefs
swagger
about
*NL*
in
gold
lace
and
broadcloth
,
while
the
great
mass
of
the
common
people
*NL*
are
nearly
as
primitive
in
their
appearance
as
in
the
days
of
Cook
.
In
*NL*
the
progress
of
events
at
these
islands
,
the
two
classes
are
receding
*NL*
from
each
other
;
the
chiefs
are
daily
becoming
more
luxurious
and
*NL*
extravagant
in
their
style
of
living
,
and
the
common
people
more
and
*NL*
more
destitute
of
the
necessaries
and
decencies
of
life
.
But
the
end
*NL*
to
which
both
will
arrive
at
last
will
be
the
same
:
the
one
are
fast
*NL*
destroying
themselves
by
sensual
indulgences
,
and
the
other
are
*NL*
fast
being
destroyed
by
a
complication
of
disorders
,
and
the
want
of
*NL*
wholesome
food
.
The
resources
of
the
domineering
chiefs
are
wrung
from
*NL*
the
starving
serfs
,
and
every
additional
bauble
with
which
they
bedeck
*NL*
themselves
is
purchased
by
the
sufferings
of
their
bondsmen
;
so
that
the
*NL*
measure
of
gew-gaw
refinement
attained
by
the
chiefs
is
only
an
index
*NL*
to
the
actual
state
in
which
the
greater
portion
of
the
population
lie
*NL*
grovelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
`
blood
royal
'
is
an
extremely
thick
,
depraved
fluid
;
formed
*NL*
principally
of
raw
fish
,
bad
brandy
,
and
European
sweetmeats
,
and
is
*NL*
charged
with
a
variety
of
eruptive
humours
,
which
are
developed
in
*NL*
sundry
blotches
and
pimples
upon
the
august
face
of
`
majesty
itself
'
,
*NL*
and
the
angelic
countenances
of
the
`
princes
and
princesses
of
the
blood
*NL*
royal
'
!
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
if
the
farcical
puppet
of
a
chief
magistrate
in
the
Sandwich
*NL*
Islands
be
allowed
the
title
of
King
,
why
should
it
be
withheld
from
*NL*
the
noble
savage
Mehevi
,
who
is
a
thousand
times
more
worthy
of
the
*NL*
appellation
?
All
hail
,
therefore
,
Mehevi
,
King
of
the
Cannibal
Valley
,
*NL*
and
long
life
and
prosperity
to
his
Typeean
majesty
!
May
Heaven
for
many
*NL*
a
year
preserve
him
,
the
uncompromising
foe
of
Nukuheva
and
the
French
,
*NL*
if
a
hostile
attitude
will
secure
his
lovely
domain
from
the
remorseless
*NL*
inflictions
of
South
Sea
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
Previously
to
seeing
the
Dancing
Widows
I
had
little
idea
that
there
*NL*
were
any
matrimonial
relations
subsisting
in
Typee
,
and
I
should
as
soon
*NL*
have
thought
of
a
Platonic
affection
being
cultivated
between
the
sexes
,
*NL*
as
of
the
solemn
connection
of
man
and
wife
.
To
be
sure
,
there
were
old
*NL*
Marheyo
and
Tinor
,
who
seemed
to
have
a
sort
of
nuptial
understanding
*NL*
with
one
another
;
but
for
all
that
,
I
had
sometimes
observed
a
*NL*
comical-looking
old
gentleman
dressed
in
a
suit
of
shabby
tattooing
,
who
*NL*
had
the
audacity
to
take
various
liberties
with
the
lady
,
and
that
too
*NL*
in
the
very
presence
of
the
old
warrior
her
husband
,
who
looked
on
*NL*
as
good-naturedly
as
if
nothing
was
happening
.
This
behaviour
,
until
*NL*
subsequent
discoveries
enlightened
me
,
puzzled
me
more
than
anything
*NL*
else
I
witnessed
in
Typee
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Mehevi
,
I
had
supposed
him
a
confirmed
bachelor
,
as
well
as
most
*NL*
of
the
principal
chiefs
.
At
any
rate
,
if
they
had
wives
and
families
,
*NL*
they
ought
to
have
been
ashamed
of
themselves
;
for
sure
I
am
,
they
never
*NL*
troubled
themselves
about
any
domestic
affairs
.
In
truth
,
Mehevi
seemed
*NL*
to
be
the
president
of
a
club
of
hearty
fellows
,
who
kept
`
Bachelor
's
*NL*
Hall
'
in
fine
style
at
the
Ti
.
I
had
no
doubt
but
that
they
regarded
*NL*
children
as
odious
incumbrances
;
and
their
ideas
of
domestic
felicity
*NL*
were
sufficiently
shown
in
the
fact
,
that
they
allowed
no
meddlesome
*NL*
housekeepers
to
turn
topsy-turvy
those
snug
little
arrangements
they
had
*NL*
made
in
their
comfortable
dwelling
.
I
strongly
suspected
however
,
that
*NL*
some
of
these
jolly
bachelors
were
carrying
on
love
intrigues
with
*NL*
the
maidens
of
the
tribe
;
although
they
did
not
appear
publicly
to
*NL*
acknowledge
them
.
I
happened
to
pop
upon
Mehevi
three
or
four
times
when
*NL*
he
was
romping
--
in
a
most
undignified
manner
for
a
warrior
king
--
with
*NL*
one
of
the
prettiest
little
witches
in
the
valley
.
She
lived
with
an
*NL*
old
woman
and
a
young
man
,
in
a
house
near
Marheyo
's
;
and
although
in
*NL*
appearance
a
mere
child
herself
,
had
a
noble
boy
about
a
year
old
,
who
*NL*
bore
a
marvellous
resemblance
to
Mehevi
,
whom
I
should
certainly
have
*NL*
believed
to
have
been
the
father
,
were
it
not
that
the
little
fellow
*NL*
had
no
triangle
on
his
face
--
but
on
second
thoughts
,
tattooing
is
not
*NL*
hereditary
.
Mehevi
,
however
,
was
not
the
only
person
upon
whom
the
*NL*
damsel
Moonoony
smiled
--
the
young
fellow
of
fifteen
,
who
permanently
*NL*
resided
in
the
home
with
her
,
was
decidedly
in
her
good
graces
.
I
*NL*
sometimes
beheld
both
him
and
the
chief
making
love
at
the
same
time
.
Is
*NL*
it
possible
,
thought
I
,
that
the
valiant
warrior
can
consent
to
give
*NL*
up
a
corner
in
the
thing
he
loves
?
This
too
was
a
mystery
which
,
with
*NL*
others
of
the
same
kind
,
was
afterwards
satisfactorily
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
second
day
of
the
Feast
of
Calabashes
,
Kory-Kory
--
being
*NL*
determined
that
I
should
have
some
understanding
on
these
matters
--
had
,
*NL*
in
the
course
of
his
explanations
,
directed
my
attention
to
*NL*
a
peculiarity
I
had
frequently
remarked
among
many
of
the
*NL*
females
;
--
principally
those
of
a
mature
age
and
rather
matronly
*NL*
appearance
.
This
consisted
in
having
the
right
hand
and
the
left
foot
*NL*
most
elaborately
tattooed
;
whilst
the
rest
of
the
body
was
wholly
free
*NL*
from
the
operation
of
the
art
,
with
the
exception
of
the
minutely
dotted
*NL*
lips
and
slight
marks
on
the
shoulders
,
to
which
I
have
previously
*NL*
referred
as
comprising
the
sole
tattooing
exhibited
by
Fayaway
,
in
*NL*
common
with
other
young
girls
of
her
age
.
The
hand
and
foot
thus
*NL*
embellished
were
,
according
to
Kory-Kory
,
the
distinguishing
badge
of
*NL*
wedlock
,
so
far
as
that
social
and
highly
commendable
institution
is
*NL*
known
among
those
people
.
It
answers
,
indeed
,
the
same
purpose
as
the
*NL*
plain
gold
ring
worn
by
our
fairer
spouses
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
Kory-Kory
's
explanation
of
the
subject
,
I
was
for
some
time
*NL*
studiously
respectful
in
the
presence
of
all
females
thus
distinguished
,
*NL*
and
never
ventured
to
indulge
in
the
slightest
approach
to
flirtation
*NL*
with
any
of
their
number
.
Married
women
,
to
be
sure
!
--
I
knew
better
than
*NL*
to
offend
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
further
insight
,
however
,
into
the
peculiar
domestic
customs
of
the
*NL*
inmates
of
the
valley
did
away
in
a
measure
with
the
severity
of
my
*NL*
scruples
,
and
convinced
me
that
I
was
deceived
in
some
at
least
of
my
*NL*
conclusions
.
A
regular
system
of
polygamy
exists
among
the
islanders
;
*NL*
but
of
a
most
extraordinary
nature
,
--
a
plurality
of
husbands
,
instead
of
*NL*
wives
!
and
this
solitary
fact
speaks
volumes
for
the
gentle
disposition
*NL*
of
the
male
population
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
else
,
indeed
,
could
such
a
practice
exist
,
even
for
a
single
*NL*
day
?
--
Imagine
a
revolution
brought
about
in
a
Turkish
seraglio
,
and
*NL*
the
harem
rendered
the
abode
of
bearded
men
;
or
conceive
some
beautiful
*NL*
woman
in
our
own
country
running
distracted
at
the
sight
of
her
numerous
*NL*
lovers
murdering
one
another
before
her
eyes
,
out
of
jealousy
for
the
*NL*
unequal
distribution
of
her
favours
!
--
Heaven
defend
us
from
such
a
state
*NL*
of
things
!
--
We
are
scarcely
amiable
and
forbearing
enough
to
submit
to
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
not
able
to
learn
what
particular
ceremony
was
observed
in
forming
*NL*
the
marriage
contract
,
but
am
inclined
to
think
that
it
must
have
been
*NL*
of
a
very
simple
nature
.
Perhaps
the
mere
`
popping
the
question
'
,
as
*NL*
it
is
termed
with
us
,
might
have
been
followed
by
an
immediate
nuptial
*NL*
alliance
.
At
any
rate
,
I
have
more
than
one
reason
to
believe
that
*NL*
tedious
courtships
are
unknown
in
the
valley
of
Typee
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
males
considerably
outnumber
the
females
.
This
holds
true
of
many
*NL*
of
the
islands
of
Polynesia
,
although
the
reverse
of
what
is
the
case
in
*NL*
most
civilized
countries
.
The
girls
are
first
wooed
and
won
,
at
a
very
*NL*
tender
age
,
by
some
stripling
in
the
household
in
which
they
reside
.
*NL*
This
,
however
,
is
a
mere
frolic
of
the
affections
,
and
no
formal
*NL*
engagement
is
contracted
.
By
the
time
this
first
love
has
a
little
*NL*
subsided
,
a
second
suitor
presents
himself
,
of
graver
years
,
and
carries
*NL*
both
boy
and
girl
away
to
his
own
habitation
.
This
disinterested
and
*NL*
generous-hearted
fellow
now
weds
the
young
couple
--
marrying
damsel
*NL*
and
lover
at
the
same
time
--
and
all
three
thenceforth
live
together
*NL*
as
harmoniously
as
so
many
turtles
.
I
have
heard
of
some
men
who
in
*NL*
civilized
countries
rashly
marry
large
families
with
their
wives
,
but
*NL*
had
no
idea
that
there
was
any
place
where
people
married
supplementary
*NL*
husbands
with
them
.
Infidelity
on
either
side
is
very
rare
.
No
man
*NL*
has
more
than
one
wife
,
and
no
wife
of
mature
years
has
less
than
two
*NL*
husbands
,
--
sometimes
she
has
three
,
but
such
instances
are
not
*NL*
frequent
.
The
marriage
tie
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
does
not
appear
to
be
*NL*
indissoluble
;
for
separations
occasionally
happen
.
These
,
however
,
*NL*
when
they
do
take
place
,
produce
no
unhappiness
,
and
are
preceded
by
no
*NL*
bickerings
;
for
the
simple
reason
,
that
an
ill-used
wife
or
a
henpecked
*NL*
husband
is
not
obliged
to
file
a
bill
in
Chancery
to
obtain
a
divorce
.
*NL*
As
nothing
stands
in
the
way
of
a
separation
,
the
matrimonial
yoke
sits
*NL*
easily
and
lightly
,
and
a
Typee
wife
lives
on
very
pleasant
and
sociable
*NL*
terms
with
her
husband
.
On
the
whole
,
wedlock
,
as
known
among
these
*NL*
Typees
,
seems
to
be
of
a
more
distinct
and
enduring
nature
than
*NL*
is
usually
the
case
with
barbarous
people
.
A
baneful
promiscuous
*NL*
intercourse
of
the
sexes
is
hereby
avoided
,
and
virtue
,
without
being
*NL*
clamorously
invoked
,
is
,
as
it
were
,
unconsciously
practised
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
contrast
exhibited
between
the
Marquesas
and
other
islands
of
the
*NL*
Pacific
in
this
respect
,
is
worthy
of
being
noticed
.
At
Tahiti
the
*NL*
marriage
tie
was
altogether
unknown
;
and
the
relation
of
husband
*NL*
and
wife
,
father
and
son
,
could
hardly
be
said
to
exist
.
The
Arreory
*NL*
Society
--
one
of
the
most
singular
institutions
that
ever
existed
in
any
*NL*
part
of
the
world
--
spread
universal
licentiousness
over
the
island
.
It
*NL*
was
the
voluptuous
character
of
these
people
which
rendered
the
disease
*NL*
introduced
among
them
by
De
Bougainville
's
ships
,
in
1768
,
doubly
*NL*
destructive
.
It
visited
them
like
a
plague
,
sweeping
them
off
by
*NL*
hundreds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Notwithstanding
the
existence
of
wedlock
among
the
Typees
,
the
*NL*
Scriptural
injunction
to
increase
and
multiply
seems
to
be
but
*NL*
indifferently
attended
to
.
I
never
saw
any
of
those
large
families
in
*NL*
arithmetical
or
step-ladder
progression
which
one
often
meets
with
at
*NL*
home
.
I
never
knew
of
more
than
two
youngsters
living
together
in
the
*NL*
same
home
,
and
but
seldom
even
that
number
.
As
for
the
women
,
it
was
*NL*
very
plain
that
the
anxieties
of
the
nursery
but
seldom
disturbed
the
*NL*
serenity
of
their
souls
;
and
they
were
never
seen
going
about
the
valley
*NL*
with
half
a
score
of
little
ones
tagging
at
their
apron-strings
,
or
*NL*
rather
at
the
bread-fruit-leaf
they
usually
wore
in
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ratio
of
increase
among
all
the
Polynesian
nations
is
very
small
;
*NL*
and
in
some
places
as
yet
uncorrupted
by
intercourse
with
Europeans
,
*NL*
the
births
would
appear
not
very
little
to
outnumber
the
deaths
;
the
*NL*
population
in
such
instances
remaining
nearly
the
same
for
several
*NL*
successive
generations
,
even
upon
those
islands
seldom
or
never
*NL*
desolated
by
wars
,
and
among
people
with
whom
the
crime
of
infanticide
*NL*
is
altogether
unknown
.
This
would
seem
expressively
ordained
by
*NL*
Providence
to
prevent
the
overstocking
of
the
islands
with
a
race
too
*NL*
indolent
to
cultivate
the
ground
,
and
who
,
for
that
reason
alone
,
would
,
*NL*
by
any
considerable
increase
in
their
numbers
,
be
exposed
to
the
most
*NL*
deplorable
misery
.
During
the
entire
period
of
my
stay
in
the
valley
of
*NL*
Typee
,
I
never
saw
more
than
ten
or
twelve
children
under
the
age
of
six
*NL*
months
,
and
only
became
aware
of
two
births
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
to
the
absence
of
the
marriage
tie
that
the
late
rapid
decrease
*NL*
of
the
population
of
the
Sandwich
Islands
and
of
Tahiti
is
in
part
to
be
*NL*
ascribed
.
The
vices
and
diseases
introduced
among
these
unhappy
people
*NL*
annually
swell
the
ordinary
mortality
of
the
islands
,
while
,
from
the
*NL*
same
cause
,
the
originally
small
number
of
births
is
proportionally
*NL*
decreased
.
Thus
the
progress
of
the
Hawaiians
and
Tahitians
to
utter
*NL*
extinction
is
accelerated
in
a
sort
of
compound
ratio
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
before
had
occasion
to
remark
,
that
I
never
saw
any
of
the
*NL*
ordinary
signs
of
a
pace
of
sepulture
in
the
valley
,
a
circumstance
*NL*
which
I
attributed
,
at
the
time
,
to
my
living
in
a
particular
part
*NL*
of
it
,
and
being
forbidden
to
extend
my
rambles
to
any
considerable
*NL*
distance
towards
the
sea
.
I
have
since
thought
it
probable
,
however
,
*NL*
that
the
Typees
,
either
desirous
of
removing
from
their
sight
the
*NL*
evidences
of
mortality
,
or
prompted
by
a
taste
for
rural
beauty
,
may
*NL*
have
some
charming
cemetery
situation
in
the
shadowy
recesses
along
*NL*
the
base
of
the
mountains
.
At
Nukuheva
,
two
or
three
large
quadrangular
*NL*
`
pi-pis
'
,
heavily
flagged
,
enclosed
with
regular
stone
walls
,
and
shaded
*NL*
over
and
almost
hidden
from
view
by
the
interlacing
branches
of
*NL*
enormous
trees
,
were
pointed
out
to
me
as
burial-places
.
The
bodies
,
I
*NL*
understood
,
were
deposited
in
rude
vaults
beneath
the
flagging
,
and
were
*NL*
suffered
to
remain
there
without
being
disinterred
.
Although
nothing
*NL*
could
be
more
strange
and
gloomy
than
the
aspect
of
these
places
,
where
*NL*
the
lofty
trees
threw
their
dark
shadows
over
rude
blocks
of
stone
,
*NL*
a
stranger
looking
at
them
would
have
discerned
none
of
the
ordinary
*NL*
evidences
of
a
place
of
sepulture
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
my
stay
in
the
valley
,
as
none
of
its
inmates
were
so
*NL*
accommodating
as
to
die
and
be
buried
in
order
to
gratify
my
curiosity
*NL*
with
regard
to
their
funeral
rites
,
I
was
reluctantly
obliged
to
*NL*
remain
in
ignorance
of
them
.
As
I
have
reason
to
believe
,
however
,
the
*NL*
observances
of
the
Typees
in
these
matters
are
the
same
with
those
of
*NL*
all
the
other
tribes
in
the
island
,
I
will
here
relate
a
scene
I
chanced
*NL*
to
witness
at
Nukuheva
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
man
had
died
,
about
daybreak
,
in
a
house
near
the
beach
.
I
had
*NL*
been
sent
ashore
that
morning
,
and
saw
a
good
deal
of
the
preparations
*NL*
they
were
making
for
his
obsequies
.
The
body
,
neatly
wrapped
in
a
new
*NL*
white
tappa
,
was
laid
out
in
an
open
shed
of
cocoanut
boughs
,
upon
a
*NL*
bier
constructed
of
elastic
bamboos
ingeniously
twisted
together
.
This
*NL*
was
supported
about
two
feet
from
the
ground
,
by
large
canes
planted
*NL*
uprightly
in
the
earth
.
Two
females
,
of
a
dejected
appearance
,
watched
*NL*
by
its
side
,
plaintively
chanting
and
beating
the
air
with
large
grass
*NL*
fans
whitened
with
pipe-clay
.
In
the
dwelling-house
adjoining
a
numerous
*NL*
company
we
assembled
,
and
various
articles
of
food
were
being
prepared
*NL*
for
consumption
.
Two
or
three
individuals
,
distinguished
by
head-dresses
*NL*
of
beautiful
tappa
,
and
wearing
a
great
number
of
ornaments
,
appeared
*NL*
to
officiate
as
masters
of
the
ceremonies
.
By
noon
the
entertainment
had
*NL*
fairly
begun
and
we
were
told
that
it
would
last
during
the
whole
of
*NL*
the
two
following
days
.
With
the
exception
of
those
who
mourned
by
*NL*
the
corpse
,
every
one
seemed
disposed
to
drown
the
sense
of
the
late
*NL*
bereavement
in
convivial
indulgence
.
The
girls
,
decked
out
in
their
*NL*
savage
finery
,
danced
;
the
old
men
chanted
;
the
warriors
smoked
and
*NL*
chatted
;
and
the
young
and
lusty
,
of
both
sexes
,
feasted
plentifully
,
*NL*
and
seemed
to
enjoy
themselves
as
pleasantly
as
they
could
have
done
had
*NL*
it
been
a
wedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
islanders
understand
the
art
of
embalming
,
and
practise
it
with
such
*NL*
success
that
the
bodies
of
their
great
chiefs
are
frequently
preserved
*NL*
for
many
years
in
the
very
houses
where
they
died
.
I
saw
three
of
these
*NL*
in
my
visit
to
the
Bay
of
Tior
.
One
was
enveloped
in
immense
folds
of
*NL*
tappa
,
with
only
the
face
exposed
,
and
hung
erect
against
the
side
of
*NL*
the
dwelling
.
The
others
were
stretched
out
upon
biers
of
bamboo
,
in
*NL*
open
,
elevated
temples
,
which
seemed
consecrated
to
their
memory
.
The
*NL*
heads
of
enemies
killed
in
battle
are
invariably
preserved
and
hung
up
*NL*
as
trophies
in
the
house
of
the
conqueror
.
I
am
not
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
process
which
is
in
use
,
but
believe
that
fumigation
is
the
principal
*NL*
agency
employed
.
All
the
remains
which
I
saw
presented
the
appearance
of
*NL*
a
ham
after
being
suspended
for
some
time
in
a
smoky
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
from
the
dead
to
the
living
.
The
late
festival
had
drawn
*NL*
together
,
as
I
had
every
reason
to
believe
,
the
whole
population
of
the
*NL*
vale
,
and
consequently
I
was
enabled
to
make
some
estimate
with
regard
*NL*
to
its
numbers
.
I
should
imagine
that
there
were
about
two
thousand
*NL*
inhabitants
in
Typee
;
and
no
number
could
have
been
better
adapted
to
*NL*
the
extent
of
the
valley
.
The
valley
is
some
nine
miles
in
length
,
*NL*
and
may
average
one
in
breadth
;
the
houses
being
distributed
at
wide
*NL*
intervals
throughout
its
whole
extent
,
principally
,
however
,
towards
the
*NL*
head
of
the
vale
.
There
are
no
villages
;
the
houses
stand
here
and
there
*NL*
in
the
shadow
of
the
groves
,
or
are
scattered
along
the
banks
of
the
*NL*
winding
stream
;
their
golden-hued
bamboo
sides
and
gleaming
white
thatch
*NL*
forming
a
beautiful
contrast
to
the
perpetual
verdure
in
which
they
are
*NL*
embowered
.
There
are
no
roads
of
any
kind
in
the
valley
.
Nothing
but
a
*NL*
labyrinth
of
footpaths
twisting
and
turning
among
the
thickets
without
*NL*
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
penalty
of
the
Fall
presses
very
lightly
upon
the
valley
of
Typee
;
*NL*
for
,
with
the
one
solitary
exception
of
striking
a
light
,
I
scarcely
saw
*NL*
any
piece
of
work
performed
there
which
caused
the
sweat
to
stand
upon
*NL*
a
single
brow
.
As
for
digging
and
delving
for
a
livelihood
,
the
thing
is
*NL*
altogether
unknown
.
Nature
has
planted
the
bread-fruit
and
the
banana
,
*NL*
and
in
her
own
good
time
she
brings
them
to
maturity
,
when
the
idle
*NL*
savage
stretches
forth
his
hand
,
and
satisfies
his
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ill-fated
people
!
I
shudder
when
I
think
of
the
change
a
few
years
*NL*
will
produce
in
their
paradisaical
abode
;
and
probably
when
the
most
*NL*
destructive
vices
,
and
the
worst
attendances
on
civilization
,
shall
have
*NL*
driven
all
peace
and
happiness
from
the
valley
,
the
magnanimous
*NL*
French
will
proclaim
to
the
world
that
the
Marquesas
Islands
have
been
*NL*
converted
to
Christianity
!
and
this
the
Catholic
world
will
doubtless
*NL*
consider
as
a
glorious
event
.
Heaven
help
the
`
Isles
of
the
Sea
'
!
--
The
*NL*
sympathy
which
Christendom
feels
for
them
,
has
,
alas
!
in
too
many
*NL*
instances
proved
their
bane
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
little
do
some
of
these
poor
islanders
comprehend
when
they
look
*NL*
around
them
,
that
no
inconsiderable
part
of
their
disasters
originate
*NL*
in
certain
tea-party
excitements
,
under
the
influence
of
which
*NL*
benevolent-looking
gentlemen
in
white
cravats
solicit
alms
,
and
old
*NL*
ladies
in
spectacles
,
and
young
ladies
in
sober
russet
gowns
,
contribute
*NL*
sixpences
towards
the
creation
of
a
fund
,
the
object
of
which
is
to
*NL*
ameliorate
the
spiritual
condition
of
the
Polynesians
,
but
whose
end
has
*NL*
almost
invariably
been
to
accomplish
their
temporal
destruction
!
*NL*
*NL*
Let
the
savages
be
civilized
,
but
civilize
them
with
benefits
,
and
not
*NL*
with
evils
;
and
let
heathenism
be
destroyed
,
but
not
by
destroying
the
*NL*
heathen
.
The
Anglo-Saxon
hive
have
extirpated
Paganism
from
the
greater
*NL*
part
of
the
North
American
continent
;
but
with
it
they
have
likewise
*NL*
extirpated
the
greater
portion
of
the
Red
race
.
Civilization
is
*NL*
gradually
sweeping
from
the
earth
the
lingering
vestiges
of
Paganism
,
*NL*
and
at
the
same
time
the
shrinking
forms
of
its
unhappy
worshippers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
islands
of
Polynesia
,
no
sooner
are
the
images
overturned
,
the
*NL*
temples
demolished
,
and
the
idolators
converted
into
NOMINAL
Christians
,
*NL*
that
disease
,
vice
,
and
premature
death
make
their
appearance
.
The
*NL*
depopulated
land
is
then
recruited
from
the
rapacious
,
hordes
of
*NL*
enlightened
individuals
who
settle
themselves
within
its
borders
,
*NL*
and
clamorously
announce
the
progress
of
the
Truth
.
Neat
villas
,
trim
*NL*
gardens
,
shaven
lawns
,
spires
,
and
cupolas
arise
,
while
the
poor
savage
*NL*
soon
finds
himself
an
interloper
in
the
country
of
his
fathers
,
and
*NL*
that
too
on
the
very
site
of
the
hut
where
he
was
born
.
The
spontaneous
*NL*
fruits
of
the
earth
,
which
God
in
his
wisdom
had
ordained
for
the
*NL*
support
of
the
indolent
natives
,
remorselessly
seized
upon
and
*NL*
appropriated
by
the
stranger
,
are
devoured
before
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
starving
inhabitants
,
or
sent
on
board
the
numerous
vessels
which
now
*NL*
touch
at
their
shores
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
famished
wretches
are
cut
off
in
this
manner
from
their
natural
*NL*
supplies
,
they
are
told
by
their
benefactors
to
work
and
earn
their
*NL*
support
by
the
sweat
of
their
brows
!
But
to
no
fine
gentleman
born
to
*NL*
hereditary
opulence
,
does
this
manual
labour
come
more
unkindly
than
*NL*
to
the
luxurious
Indian
when
thus
robbed
of
the
bounty
of
heaven
.
*NL*
Habituated
to
a
life
of
indolence
,
he
can
not
and
will
not
exert
himself
;
*NL*
and
want
,
disease
,
and
vice
,
all
evils
of
foreign
growth
,
soon
terminate
*NL*
his
miserable
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
matters
all
this
?
Behold
the
glorious
result
!
--
The
abominations
*NL*
of
Paganism
have
given
way
to
the
pure
rites
of
the
Christian
*NL*
worship
,
--
the
ignorant
savage
has
been
supplanted
by
the
refined
*NL*
European
!
Look
at
Honolulu
,
the
metropolis
of
the
Sandwich
Islands
!
--
A
*NL*
community
of
disinterested
merchants
,
and
devoted
self-exiled
heralds
of
*NL*
the
Cross
,
located
on
the
very
spot
that
twenty
years
ago
was
defiled
by
*NL*
the
presence
of
idolatry
.
What
a
subject
for
an
eloquent
Bible-meeting
*NL*
orator
!
Nor
has
such
an
opportunity
for
a
display
of
missionary
rhetoric
*NL*
been
allowed
to
pass
by
unimproved
!
--
But
when
these
philanthropists
send
*NL*
us
such
glowing
accounts
of
one
half
of
their
labours
,
why
does
their
*NL*
modesty
restrain
them
from
publishing
the
other
half
of
the
good
they
*NL*
have
wrought
?
--
Not
until
I
visited
Honolulu
was
I
aware
of
the
fact
that
*NL*
the
small
remnant
of
the
natives
had
been
civilized
into
draught-horses
;
*NL*
and
evangelized
into
beasts
of
burden
.
But
so
it
is
.
They
have
been
*NL*
literally
broken
into
the
traces
,
and
are
harnessed
to
the
vehicles
of
*NL*
their
spiritual
instructors
like
so
many
dumb
brutes
!
*NL*
*NL*
...
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lest
the
slightest
misconception
should
arise
from
anything
thrown
out
*NL*
in
this
chapter
,
or
indeed
in
any
other
part
of
the
volume
,
let
me
here
*NL*
observe
that
against
the
cause
of
missions
in
,
the
abstract
no
Christian
*NL*
can
possibly
be
opposed
:
it
is
in
truth
a
just
and
holy
cause
.
But
*NL*
if
the
great
end
proposed
by
it
be
spiritual
,
the
agency
employed
to
*NL*
accomplish
that
end
is
purely
earthly
;
and
,
although
the
object
in
*NL*
view
be
the
achievement
of
much
good
,
that
agency
may
nevertheless
be
*NL*
productive
of
evil
.
In
short
,
missionary
undertaking
,
however
it
may
*NL*
blessed
of
heaven
,
is
in
itself
but
human
;
and
subject
,
like
everything
*NL*
else
,
to
errors
and
abuses
.
And
have
not
errors
and
abuses
crept
into
*NL*
the
most
sacred
places
,
and
may
there
not
be
unworthy
or
incapable
*NL*
missionaries
abroad
,
as
well
as
ecclesiastics
of
similar
character
*NL*
at
home
?
May
not
the
unworthiness
or
incapacity
of
those
who
assume
*NL*
apostolic
functions
upon
the
remote
islands
of
the
sea
more
easily
*NL*
escape
detection
by
the
world
at
large
than
if
it
were
displayed
in
*NL*
the
heart
of
a
city
?
An
unwarranted
confidence
in
the
sanctity
of
its
*NL*
apostles
--
a
proneness
to
regard
them
as
incapable
of
guile
--
and
*NL*
an
impatience
of
the
least
suspicion
to
their
rectitude
as
men
or
*NL*
Christians
,
have
ever
been
prevailing
faults
in
the
Church
.
Nor
is
this
*NL*
to
be
wondered
at
:
for
subject
as
Christianity
is
to
the
assaults
of
*NL*
unprincipled
foes
,
we
are
naturally
disposed
to
regard
everything
like
*NL*
an
exposure
of
ecclesiastical
misconduct
as
the
offspring
of
malevolence
*NL*
or
irreligious
feeling
.
Not
even
this
last
consideration
,
however
shall
*NL*
deter
me
from
the
honest
expression
of
my
sentiments
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
apparently
wrong
in
the
practical
operations
of
*NL*
the
Sandwich
Islands
Mission
.
Those
who
from
pure
religious
motives
*NL*
contribute
to
the
support
of
this
enterprise
should
take
care
to
*NL*
ascertain
that
their
donations
,
flowing
through
many
devious
channels
,
*NL*
at
last
effect
their
legitimate
object
,
the
conversion
of
the
Hawaiians
.
*NL*
I
urge
this
not
because
I
doubt
the
moral
probity
of
those
who
disburse
*NL*
the
funds
,
but
because
I
know
that
they
are
not
rightly
applied
.
To
read
*NL*
pathetic
accounts
of
missionary
hardships
,
and
glowing
descriptions
of
*NL*
conversion
,
and
baptisms
,
taking
place
beneath
palm-trees
,
is
one
thing
;
*NL*
and
to
go
to
the
Sandwich
Islands
and
see
the
missionaries
dwelling
*NL*
in
picturesque
and
prettily
furnished
coral-rock
villas
,
whilst
the
*NL*
miserable
natives
are
committing
all
sorts
of
immorality
around
them
,
is
*NL*
quite
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
justice
to
the
missionaries
,
however
,
I
will
willingly
admit
,
that
*NL*
where-ever
evils
may
have
resulted
from
their
collective
mismanagement
*NL*
of
the
business
of
the
mission
,
and
from
the
want
of
vital
piety
evinced
*NL*
by
some
of
their
number
,
still
the
present
deplorable
condition
of
the
*NL*
Sandwich
Islands
is
by
no
means
wholly
chargeable
against
them
.
The
*NL*
demoralizing
influence
of
a
dissolute
foreign
population
,
and
the
*NL*
frequent
visits
of
all
descriptions
of
vessels
,
have
tended
not
a
little
*NL*
to
increase
the
evils
alluded
to
.
In
a
word
,
here
,
as
in
every
case
*NL*
where
civilization
has
in
any
way
been
introduced
among
those
whom
we
*NL*
call
savages
,
she
has
scattered
her
vices
,
and
withheld
her
blessings
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
wise
a
man
as
Shakespeare
has
said
,
that
the
bearer
of
evil
tidings
*NL*
hath
but
a
losing
office
;
and
so
I
suppose
will
it
prove
with
me
,
in
*NL*
communicating
to
the
trusting
friends
of
the
Hawiian
Mission
what
has
*NL*
been
disclosed
in
various
portions
of
this
narrative
.
I
am
persuaded
,
*NL*
however
,
that
as
these
disclosures
will
by
their
very
nature
attract
*NL*
attention
,
so
they
will
lead
to
something
which
will
not
be
without
*NL*
ultimate
benefit
to
the
cause
of
Christianity
in
the
Sandwich
Islands
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
but
one
more
thing
to
add
in
connection
with
this
subject
--
those
*NL*
things
which
I
have
stated
as
facts
will
remain
facts
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
whatever
the
bigoted
or
incredulous
may
say
or
write
against
them
.
My
*NL*
reflections
,
however
,
on
those
facts
may
not
be
free
from
error
.
If
such
*NL*
be
the
case
,
I
claim
no
further
indulgence
than
should
be
conceded
to
*NL*
every
man
whose
object
is
to
do
good
.

CHAPTER
TWENTY-SEVEN
*NL*
*NL*
THE
SOCIAL
CONDITION
AND
GENERAL
CHARACTER
OF
THE
TYPEES
*NL*
*NL*
I
HAVE
already
mentioned
that
the
influence
exerted
over
the
people
*NL*
of
the
valley
by
their
chiefs
was
mild
in
the
extreme
;
and
as
to
any
*NL*
general
rule
or
standard
of
conduct
by
which
the
commonality
were
*NL*
governed
in
their
intercourse
with
each
other
,
so
far
as
my
observation
*NL*
extended
,
I
should
be
almost
tempted
to
say
,
that
none
existed
on
the
*NL*
island
,
except
,
indeed
,
the
mysterious
`
Taboo
'
be
considered
as
such
.
*NL*
During
the
time
I
lived
among
the
Typees
,
no
one
was
ever
put
upon
his
*NL*
trial
for
any
offence
against
the
public
.
To
all
appearance
there
*NL*
were
no
courts
of
law
or
equity
.
There
was
no
municipal
police
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
apprehending
vagrants
and
disorderly
characters
.
In
*NL*
short
,
there
were
no
legal
provisions
whatever
for
the
well-being
and
*NL*
conservation
of
society
,
the
enlightened
end
of
civilized
legislation
.
*NL*
And
yet
everything
went
on
in
the
valley
with
a
harmony
and
smoothness
*NL*
unparalleled
,
I
will
venture
to
assert
,
in
the
most
select
,
refined
,
and
*NL*
pious
associations
of
mortals
in
Christendom
.
How
are
we
to
explain
this
*NL*
enigma
?
These
islanders
were
heathens
!
savages
!
ay
,
cannibals
!
and
how
*NL*
came
they
without
the
aid
of
established
law
,
to
exhibit
,
in
so
eminent
*NL*
a
degree
,
that
social
order
which
is
the
greatest
blessing
and
highest
*NL*
pride
of
the
social
state
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
reasonably
be
inquired
,
how
were
these
people
governed
?
how
were
*NL*
their
passions
controlled
in
their
everyday
transactions
?
It
must
have
*NL*
been
by
an
inherent
principle
of
honesty
and
charity
towards
each
other
.
*NL*
They
seemed
to
be
governed
by
that
sort
of
tacit
common-sense
law
which
,
*NL*
say
what
they
will
of
the
inborn
lawlessness
of
the
human
race
,
has
*NL*
its
precepts
graven
on
every
breast
.
The
grand
principles
of
virtue
and
*NL*
honour
,
however
they
may
be
distorted
by
arbitrary
codes
,
are
the
same
*NL*
all
the
world
over
:
and
where
these
principles
are
concerned
,
the
right
*NL*
or
wrong
of
any
action
appears
the
same
to
the
uncultivated
as
to
the
*NL*
enlightened
mind
.
It
is
to
this
indwelling
,
this
universally
diffused
*NL*
perception
of
what
is
just
and
noble
,
that
the
integrity
of
the
*NL*
Marquesans
in
their
intercourse
with
each
other
,
is
to
be
attributed
.
*NL*
In
the
darkest
nights
they
slept
securely
,
with
all
their
worldly
wealth
*NL*
around
them
,
in
houses
the
doors
of
which
were
never
fastened
.
The
*NL*
disquieting
ideas
of
theft
or
assassination
never
disturbed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
islander
reposed
beneath
his
own
palmetto
thatching
,
or
sat
under
*NL*
his
own
bread-fruit
trees
,
with
none
to
molest
or
alarm
him
.
There
was
*NL*
not
a
padlock
in
the
valley
,
nor
anything
that
answered
the
purpose
*NL*
of
one
:
still
there
was
no
community
of
goods
.
This
long
spear
,
so
*NL*
elegantly
carved
,
and
highly
polished
,
belongs
to
Wormoonoo
:
it
is
far
*NL*
handsomer
than
the
one
which
old
Marheyo
so
greatly
prizes
;
it
is
the
*NL*
most
valuable
article
belonging
to
its
owner
.
And
yet
I
have
seen
it
*NL*
leaning
against
a
cocoanut
tree
in
the
grove
,
and
there
it
was
found
*NL*
when
sought
for
.
Here
is
a
sperm-whale
tooth
,
graven
all
over
with
*NL*
cunning
devices
:
it
is
the
property
of
Karluna
;
it
is
the
most
precious
*NL*
of
the
damsel
's
ornaments
.
In
her
estimation
its
price
is
far
above
*NL*
rubies
--
and
yet
there
hangs
the
dental
jewel
by
its
cord
of
braided
*NL*
bark
,
in
the
girl
's
house
,
which
is
far
back
in
the
valley
;
the
door
is
*NL*
left
open
,
and
all
the
inmates
have
gone
off
to
bathe
in
the
stream
.
*
*NL*
*NL*
*
The
strict
honesty
which
the
inhabitants
of
nearly
all
the
Polynesian
*NL*
Islands
manifest
toward
each
other
,
is
in
striking
contrast
with
the
*NL*
thieving
propensities
some
of
them
evince
in
their
intercourse
with
*NL*
foreigners
.
It
would
almost
seem
that
,
according
to
their
peculiar
code
*NL*
of
morals
,
the
pilfering
of
a
hatchet
or
a
wrought
nail
from
a
European
,
*NL*
is
looked
upon
as
a
praiseworthy
action
.
Or
rather
,
it
may
be
presumed
,
*NL*
that
bearing
in
mind
the
wholesale
forays
made
upon
them
by
their
*NL*
nautical
visitors
,
they
consider
the
property
of
the
latter
as
a
fair
*NL*
object
of
reprisal
.
This
consideration
,
while
it
serves
to
reconcile
an
*NL*
apparent
contradiction
in
the
moral
character
of
the
islanders
,
should
*NL*
in
some
measure
alter
that
low
opinion
of
it
which
the
reader
of
South
*NL*
Sea
voyages
is
too
apt
to
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
So
much
for
the
respect
in
which
`
personal
property
'
is
held
in
Typee
;
*NL*
how
secure
an
investment
of
`
real
property
'
may
be
,
I
can
not
take
upon
*NL*
me
to
say
.
Whether
the
land
of
the
valley
was
the
joint
property
of
its
*NL*
inhabitants
,
or
whether
it
was
parcelled
out
among
a
certain
number
of
*NL*
landed
proprietors
who
allowed
everybody
to
`
squat
'
and
`
poach
'
as
*NL*
much
as
he
or
she
pleased
,
I
never
could
ascertain
.
At
any
rate
,
musty
*NL*
parchments
and
title-deeds
there
were
none
on
the
island
;
and
I
am
half
*NL*
inclined
to
believe
that
its
inhabitants
hold
their
broad
valleys
in
fee
*NL*
simple
from
Nature
herself
;
to
have
and
to
hold
,
so
long
as
grass
grows
*NL*
and
water
runs
;
or
until
their
French
visitors
,
by
a
summary
mode
of
*NL*
conveyancing
,
shall
appropriate
them
to
their
own
benefit
and
behoof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yesterday
I
saw
Kory-Kory
hie
him
away
,
armed
with
a
long
pole
,
with
*NL*
which
,
standing
on
the
ground
,
he
knocked
down
the
fruit
from
the
*NL*
topmost
boughs
of
the
trees
,
and
brought
them
home
in
his
basket
of
*NL*
cocoanut
leaves
.
Today
I
see
an
islander
,
whom
I
know
to
reside
in
a
*NL*
distant
part
of
the
valley
,
doing
the
self-same
thing
.
On
the
sloping
*NL*
bank
of
the
stream
are
a
number
of
banana-trees
I
have
often
seen
a
*NL*
score
or
two
of
young
people
making
a
merry
foray
on
the
great
golden
*NL*
clusters
,
and
bearing
them
off
,
one
after
another
,
to
different
parts
*NL*
of
the
vale
,
shouting
and
trampling
as
they
went
.
No
churlish
old
*NL*
curmudgeon
could
have
been
the
owner
of
that
grove
of
bread-fruit
trees
,
*NL*
or
of
these
gloriously
yellow
bunches
of
bananas
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
what
I
have
said
it
will
be
perceived
that
there
is
a
vast
*NL*
difference
between
`
personal
property
'
and
`
real
estate
'
in
the
valley
*NL*
of
Typee
.
Some
individuals
,
of
course
,
are
more
wealthy
than
others
.
*NL*
For
example
,
the
ridge-pole
of
Marheyo
's
house
bends
under
the
weight
of
*NL*
many
a
huge
packet
of
tappa
;
his
long
couch
is
laid
with
mats
placed
one
*NL*
upon
the
other
seven
deep
.
Outside
,
Tinor
has
ranged
along
in
her
*NL*
bamboo
cupboard
--
or
whatever
the
place
may
be
called
--
a
goodly
array
of
*NL*
calabashes
and
wooden
trenchers
.
Now
,
the
house
just
beyond
the
grove
,
*NL*
and
next
to
Marheyo
's
,
occupied
by
Ruaruga
,
is
not
quite
so
well
*NL*
furnished
.
There
are
only
three
moderate-sized
packages
swinging
*NL*
overhead
:
there
are
only
two
layers
of
mats
beneath
;
and
the
calabashes
*NL*
and
trenchers
are
not
so
numerous
,
nor
so
tastefully
stained
and
carved
.
*NL*
But
then
,
Ruaruga
has
a
house
--
not
so
pretty
a
one
,
to
be
sure
--
but
just
*NL*
as
commodious
as
Marheyo
's
;
and
,
I
suppose
,
if
he
wished
to
vie
with
*NL*
his
neighbour
's
establishment
,
he
could
do
so
with
very
little
trouble
.
*NL*
These
,
in
short
,
constituted
the
chief
differences
perceivable
in
the
*NL*
relative
wealth
of
the
people
in
Typee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Civilization
does
not
engross
all
the
virtues
of
humanity
:
she
has
not
*NL*
even
her
full
share
of
them
.
They
flourish
in
greater
abundance
and
*NL*
attain
greater
strength
among
many
barbarous
people
.
The
hospitality
*NL*
of
the
wild
Arab
,
the
courage
of
the
North
American
Indian
,
and
the
*NL*
faithful
friendship
of
some
of
the
Polynesian
nations
,
far
surpass
*NL*
anything
of
a
similar
kind
among
the
polished
communities
of
Europe
.
If
*NL*
truth
and
justice
,
and
the
better
principles
of
our
nature
,
can
not
*NL*
exist
unless
enforced
by
the
statute-book
,
how
are
we
to
account
for
the
*NL*
social
condition
of
the
Typees
?
So
pure
and
upright
were
they
in
all
the
*NL*
relations
of
life
,
that
entering
their
valley
,
as
I
did
,
under
the
most
*NL*
erroneous
impressions
of
their
character
,
I
was
soon
led
to
exclaim
in
*NL*
amazement
:
`
Are
these
the
ferocious
savages
,
the
blood-thirsty
cannibals
*NL*
of
whom
I
have
heard
such
frightful
tales
!
They
deal
more
kindly
with
*NL*
each
other
,
and
are
more
humane
than
many
who
study
essays
on
virtue
and
*NL*
benevolence
,
and
who
repeat
every
night
that
beautiful
prayer
breathed
*NL*
first
by
the
lips
of
the
divine
and
gentle
Jesus
.
'
I
will
frankly
*NL*
declare
that
after
passing
a
few
weeks
in
this
valley
of
the
Marquesas
,
*NL*
I
formed
a
higher
estimate
of
human
nature
than
I
had
ever
before
*NL*
entertained
.
But
alas
!
since
then
I
have
been
one
of
the
crew
of
a
*NL*
man-of-war
,
and
the
pent-up
wickedness
of
five
hundred
men
has
nearly
*NL*
overturned
all
my
previous
theories
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
admirable
trait
in
the
general
character
of
the
Typees
*NL*
which
,
more
than
anything
else
,
secured
my
admiration
:
it
was
the
*NL*
unanimity
of
feeling
they
displayed
on
every
occasion
.
With
them
*NL*
there
hardly
appeared
to
be
any
difference
of
opinion
upon
any
subject
*NL*
whatever
.
They
all
thought
and
acted
alike
.
I
do
not
conceive
that
they
*NL*
could
support
a
debating
society
for
a
single
night
:
there
would
be
*NL*
nothing
to
dispute
about
;
and
were
they
to
call
a
convention
to
take
*NL*
into
consideration
the
state
of
the
tribe
,
its
session
would
be
a
*NL*
remarkably
short
one
.
They
showed
this
spirit
of
unanimity
in
every
*NL*
action
of
life
;
everything
was
done
in
concert
and
good
fellowship
.
I
*NL*
will
give
an
instance
of
this
fraternal
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
in
returning
with
Kory-Kory
from
my
accustomed
visit
to
the
*NL*
Ti
,
we
passed
by
a
little
opening
in
the
grove
;
on
one
side
of
which
,
*NL*
my
attendant
informed
me
,
was
that
afternoon
to
be
built
a
dwelling
of
*NL*
bamboo
.
At
least
a
hundred
of
the
natives
were
bringing
materials
to
the
*NL*
ground
,
some
carrying
in
their
hands
one
or
two
of
the
canes
which
were
*NL*
to
form
the
sides
,
others
slender
rods
of
the
habiscus
,
strung
with
*NL*
palmetto
leaves
,
for
the
roof
.
Every
one
contributed
something
to
the
*NL*
work
;
and
by
the
united
,
but
easy
,
and
even
indolent
,
labours
of
all
,
*NL*
the
entire
work
was
completed
before
sunset
.
The
islanders
,
while
*NL*
employed
in
erecting
this
tenement
,
reminded
me
of
a
colony
of
beavers
*NL*
at
work
.
To
be
sure
,
they
were
hardly
as
silent
and
demure
as
those
*NL*
wonderful
creatures
,
nor
were
they
by
any
means
as
diligent
.
To
tell
the
*NL*
truth
they
were
somewhat
inclined
to
be
lazy
,
but
a
perfect
tumult
of
*NL*
hilarity
prevailed
;
and
they
worked
together
so
unitedly
,
and
seemed
*NL*
actuated
by
such
an
instinct
of
friendliness
,
that
it
was
truly
*NL*
beautiful
to
behold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
single
female
took
part
in
this
employment
:
and
if
the
degree
of
*NL*
consideration
in
which
the
ever-adorable
sex
is
held
by
the
men
be
--
as
*NL*
the
philosophers
affirm
--
a
just
criterion
of
the
degree
of
refinement
*NL*
among
a
people
,
then
I
may
truly
pronounce
the
Typees
to
be
as
polished
*NL*
a
community
as
ever
the
sun
shone
upon
.
The
religious
restrictions
of
*NL*
the
taboo
alone
excepted
,
the
women
of
the
valley
were
allowed
every
*NL*
possible
indulgence
.
Nowhere
are
the
ladies
more
assiduously
courted
;
*NL*
nowhere
are
they
better
appreciated
as
the
contributors
to
our
highest
*NL*
enjoyments
;
and
nowhere
are
they
more
sensible
of
their
power
.
Far
*NL*
different
from
their
condition
among
many
rude
nations
,
where
the
women
*NL*
are
made
to
perform
all
the
work
while
their
ungallant
lords
and
masters
*NL*
lie
buried
in
sloth
,
the
gentle
sex
in
the
valley
of
Typee
were
exempt
*NL*
from
toil
,
if
toil
it
might
be
called
that
,
even
in
the
tropical
*NL*
climate
,
never
distilled
one
drop
of
perspiration
.
Their
light
household
*NL*
occupations
,
together
with
the
manufacture
of
tappa
,
the
platting
of
*NL*
mats
,
and
the
polishing
of
drinking-vessels
,
were
the
only
employments
*NL*
pertaining
to
the
women
.
And
even
these
resembled
those
pleasant
*NL*
avocations
which
fill
up
the
elegant
morning
leisure
of
our
fashionable
*NL*
ladies
at
home
.
But
in
these
occupations
,
slight
and
agreeable
though
*NL*
they
were
,
the
giddy
young
girls
very
seldom
engaged
.
Indeed
these
*NL*
wilful
care-killing
damsels
were
averse
to
all
useful
employment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
so
many
spoiled
beauties
,
they
ranged
through
the
groves
--
bathed
*NL*
in
the
stream
--
danced
--
flirted
--
played
all
manner
of
mischievous
pranks
,
*NL*
and
passed
their
days
in
one
merry
round
of
thoughtless
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
my
whole
stay
on
the
island
I
never
witnessed
a
single
quarrel
,
*NL*
nor
anything
that
in
the
slightest
degree
approached
even
to
a
dispute
.
*NL*
The
natives
appeared
to
form
one
household
,
whose
members
were
bound
*NL*
together
by
the
ties
of
strong
affection
.
The
love
of
kindred
I
did
not
*NL*
so
much
perceive
,
for
it
seemed
blended
in
the
general
love
;
and
where
*NL*
all
were
treated
as
brothers
and
sisters
,
it
was
hard
to
tell
who
were
*NL*
actually
related
to
each
other
by
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
it
not
be
supposed
that
I
have
overdrawn
this
picture
.
I
have
*NL*
not
done
so
.
Nor
let
it
be
urged
,
that
the
hostility
of
this
tribe
*NL*
to
foreigners
,
and
the
hereditary
feuds
they
carry
on
against
their
*NL*
fellow-islanders
beyond
the
mountains
,
are
facts
which
contradict
me
.
*NL*
Not
so
;
these
apparent
discrepancies
are
easily
reconciled
.
By
many
a
*NL*
legendary
tale
of
violence
and
wrong
,
as
well
as
by
events
which
have
*NL*
passed
before
their
eyes
,
these
people
have
been
taught
to
look
upon
*NL*
white
men
with
abhorrence
.
The
cruel
invasion
of
their
country
by
Porter
*NL*
has
alone
furnished
them
with
ample
provocation
;
and
I
can
sympathize
*NL*
in
the
spirit
which
prompts
the
Typee
warrior
to
guard
all
the
passes
to
*NL*
his
valley
with
the
point
of
his
levelled
spear
,
and
,
standing
upon
*NL*
the
beach
,
with
his
back
turned
upon
his
green
home
,
to
hold
at
bay
the
*NL*
intruding
European
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
origin
of
the
enmity
of
this
particular
clan
towards
the
*NL*
neighbouring
tribes
,
I
can
not
so
confidently
speak
.
I
will
not
say
that
*NL*
their
foes
are
the
aggressors
,
nor
will
I
endeavour
to
palliate
their
*NL*
conduct
.
But
surely
,
if
our
evil
passions
must
find
vent
,
it
is
far
*NL*
better
to
expend
them
on
strangers
and
aliens
,
than
in
the
bosom
of
*NL*
the
community
in
which
we
dwell
.
In
many
polished
countries
civil
*NL*
contentions
,
as
well
as
domestic
enmities
,
are
prevalent
,
and
the
same
*NL*
time
that
the
most
atrocious
foreign
wars
are
waged
.
How
much
less
*NL*
guilty
,
then
,
are
our
islanders
,
who
of
these
three
sins
are
only
*NL*
chargeable
with
one
,
and
that
the
least
criminal
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
ere
long
have
reason
to
suspect
that
the
Typees
are
not
*NL*
free
from
the
guilt
of
cannibalism
;
and
he
will
then
,
perhaps
,
charge
me
*NL*
with
admiring
a
people
against
whom
so
odious
a
crime
is
chargeable
.
But
*NL*
this
only
enormity
in
their
character
is
not
half
so
horrible
as
it
*NL*
is
usually
described
.
According
to
the
popular
fictions
,
the
crews
of
*NL*
vessels
,
shipwrecked
on
some
barbarous
coast
,
are
eaten
alive
like
so
*NL*
many
dainty
joints
by
the
uncivil
inhabitants
;
and
unfortunate
voyagers
*NL*
are
lured
into
smiling
and
treacherous
bays
;
knocked
on
the
head
with
*NL*
outlandish
war-clubs
;
and
served
up
without
any
prelimary
dressing
.
In
*NL*
truth
,
so
horrific
and
improbable
are
these
accounts
,
that
many
sensible
*NL*
and
well-informed
people
will
not
believe
that
any
cannibals
exist
;
and
*NL*
place
every
book
of
voyages
which
purports
to
give
any
account
of
them
,
*NL*
on
the
same
shelf
with
Blue
Beard
and
Jack
the
Giant-Killer
.
While
*NL*
others
,
implicitly
crediting
the
most
extravagant
fictions
,
firmly
*NL*
believe
that
there
are
people
in
the
world
with
tastes
so
depraved
that
*NL*
they
would
infinitely
prefer
a
single
mouthful
of
material
humanity
to
*NL*
a
good
dinner
of
roast
beef
and
plum
pudding
.
But
here
,
Truth
,
who
loves
*NL*
to
be
centrally
located
,
is
again
found
between
the
two
extremes
;
for
*NL*
cannibalism
to
a
certain
moderate
extent
is
practised
among
several
of
*NL*
the
primitive
tribes
in
the
Pacific
,
but
it
is
upon
the
bodies
of
slain
*NL*
enemies
alone
,
and
horrible
and
fearful
as
the
custom
is
,
immeasurably
*NL*
as
it
is
to
be
abhorred
and
condemned
,
still
I
assert
that
those
who
*NL*
indulge
in
it
are
in
other
respects
humane
and
virtuous
.

CHAPTER
TWENTY-EIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
FISHING
PARTIES
--
MODE
OF
DISTRIBUTING
THE
FISH
--
MIDNIGHT
*NL*
BANQUET
--
TIME-KEEPING
TAPERS
--
UNCEREMONIOUS
STYLE
OF
EATING
THE
FISH
*NL*
*NL*
THERE
was
no
instance
in
which
the
social
and
kindly
dispositions
of
the
*NL*
Typees
were
more
forcibly
evinced
than
in
the
manner
the
conducted
their
*NL*
great
fishing
parties
.
Four
times
during
my
stay
in
the
valley
the
young
*NL*
men
assembled
near
the
full
of
the
moon
,
and
went
together
on
these
*NL*
excursions
.
As
they
were
generally
absent
about
forty-eight
hours
,
I
was
*NL*
led
to
believe
that
they
went
out
towards
the
open
sea
,
some
distance
*NL*
from
the
bay
.
The
Polynesians
seldom
use
a
hook
and
line
,
almost
always
*NL*
employing
large
well-made
nets
,
most
ingeniously
fabricated
from
the
*NL*
twisted
fibres
of
a
certain
bark
.
I
examined
several
of
them
which
had
*NL*
been
spread
to
dry
upon
the
beach
at
Nukuheva
.
They
resemble
very
much
*NL*
our
own
seines
,
and
I
should
think
they
were
nearly
as
durable
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
South
Sea
Islanders
are
passionately
fond
of
fish
;
but
none
*NL*
of
them
can
be
more
so
than
the
inhabitants
of
Typee
.
I
could
not
*NL*
comprehend
,
therefore
,
why
they
so
seldom
sought
it
in
their
waters
,
for
*NL*
it
was
only
at
stated
times
that
the
fishing
parties
were
formed
,
and
*NL*
these
occasions
were
always
looked
forward
to
with
no
small
degree
of
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
their
absence
the
whole
population
of
the
place
were
in
a
*NL*
ferment
,
and
nothing
was
talked
of
but
`
pehee
,
pehee
'
-LRB-
fish
,
fish
-RRB-
.
*NL*
Towards
the
time
when
they
were
expected
to
return
the
vocal
telegraph
*NL*
was
put
into
operation
--
the
inhabitants
,
who
were
scattered
throughout
*NL*
the
length
of
the
valley
,
leaped
upon
rocks
and
into
trees
,
shouting
*NL*
with
delight
at
the
thoughts
of
the
anticipated
treat
.
As
soon
as
the
*NL*
approach
of
the
party
was
announced
,
there
was
a
general
rush
of
the
*NL*
men
towards
the
beach
;
some
of
them
remaining
,
however
,
about
the
Ti
in
*NL*
order
to
get
matters
in
readiness
for
the
reception
of
the
fish
,
which
*NL*
were
brought
to
the
Taboo
Groves
in
immense
packages
of
leaves
,
each
one
*NL*
of
them
being
suspended
from
a
pole
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
two
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
present
at
the
Ti
on
one
of
these
occasions
,
and
the
sight
was
*NL*
most
interesting
.
After
all
the
packages
had
arrived
,
they
were
laid
in
*NL*
a
row
under
the
verandah
of
the
building
and
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fish
were
all
quite
small
,
generally
about
the
size
of
a
herring
,
*NL*
and
of
every
variety
.
About
one-eighth
of
the
whole
being
reserved
*NL*
for
the
use
of
the
Ti
itself
,
the
remainder
was
divided
into
numerous
*NL*
smaller
packages
,
which
were
immediately
dispatched
in
every
direction
*NL*
to
the
remotest
parts
of
the
valley
.
Arrived
at
their
destination
,
these
*NL*
were
in
turn
portioned
out
,
and
equally
distributed
among
the
various
*NL*
houses
of
each
particular
district
.
The
fish
were
under
a
strict
Taboo
,
*NL*
until
the
distribution
was
completed
,
which
seemed
to
be
effected
in
the
*NL*
most
impartial
manner
.
By
the
operation
of
this
system
every
man
,
woman
,
*NL*
and
child
in
the
vale
,
were
at
one
and
the
same
time
partaking
of
this
*NL*
favourite
article
of
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
I
remember
the
party
arrived
at
midnight
;
but
the
unseasonableness
*NL*
of
the
tour
did
not
repress
the
impatience
of
the
islanders
.
The
*NL*
carriers
dispatched
from
the
Ti
were
to
be
seen
hurrying
in
all
*NL*
directions
through
the
deep
groves
;
each
individual
preceded
by
a
boy
*NL*
bearing
a
flaming
torch
of
dried
cocoanut
boughs
,
which
from
time
to
*NL*
time
was
replenished
from
the
materials
scattered
along
the
path
.
The
*NL*
wild
glare
of
these
enormous
flambeaux
,
lighting
up
with
a
startling
*NL*
brilliancy
the
innermost
recesses
of
the
vale
,
and
seen
moving
rapidly
*NL*
along
beneath
the
canopy
of
leaves
,
the
savage
shout
of
the
excited
*NL*
messengers
sounding
the
news
of
their
approach
,
which
was
answered
*NL*
on
all
sides
,
and
the
strange
appearance
of
their
naked
bodies
,
seen
*NL*
against
the
gloomy
background
,
produced
altogether
an
effect
upon
my
*NL*
mind
that
I
shall
long
remember
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
this
same
occasion
that
Kory-Kory
awakened
me
at
the
dead
*NL*
hour
of
night
,
and
in
a
sort
of
transport
communicated
the
intelligence
*NL*
contained
in
the
words
`
pehee
perni
'
-LRB-
fish
come
-RRB-
.
As
I
happened
to
have
*NL*
been
in
a
remarkably
sound
and
refreshing
slumber
,
I
could
not
imagine
*NL*
why
the
information
had
not
been
deferred
until
morning
,
indeed
,
I
felt
*NL*
very
much
inclined
to
fly
into
a
passion
and
box
my
valet
's
ears
;
but
on
*NL*
second
thoughts
I
got
quietly
up
,
and
on
going
outside
the
house
was
not
*NL*
a
little
interested
by
the
moving
illumination
which
I
beheld
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
old
Marheyo
received
his
share
of
the
spoils
,
immediate
*NL*
preparations
were
made
for
a
midnight
banquet
;
calabashes
of
poee-poee
*NL*
were
filled
to
the
brim
;
green
bread-fruit
were
roasted
;
and
a
huge
cake
*NL*
of
`
amar
'
was
cut
up
with
a
sliver
of
bamboo
and
laid
out
on
an
immense
*NL*
banana-leaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
supper
we
were
lighted
by
several
of
the
native
tapers
,
held
in
*NL*
the
hands
of
young
girls
.
These
tapers
are
most
ingeniously
made
.
There
*NL*
is
a
nut
abounding
in
the
valley
,
called
by
the
Typees
`
armor
'
,
closely
*NL*
resembling
our
common
horse-chestnut
.
The
shell
is
broken
,
and
the
*NL*
contents
extracted
whole
.
Any
number
of
these
are
strung
at
pleasure
*NL*
upon
the
long
elastic
fibre
that
traverses
the
branches
of
the
cocoanut
*NL*
tree
.
Some
of
these
tapers
are
eight
or
ten
feet
in
length
;
but
being
*NL*
perfectly
flexible
,
one
end
is
held
in
a
coil
,
while
the
other
is
*NL*
lighted
.
The
nut
burns
with
a
fitful
bluish
flame
,
and
the
oil
that
it
*NL*
contains
is
exhausted
in
about
ten
minutes
.
As
one
burns
down
,
the
next
*NL*
becomes
ignited
,
and
the
ashes
of
the
former
are
knocked
into
a
cocoanut
*NL*
shell
kept
for
the
purpose
.
This
primitive
candle
requires
continual
*NL*
attention
,
and
must
be
constantly
held
in
the
hand
.
The
person
so
*NL*
employed
marks
the
lapse
of
time
by
the
number
of
nuts
consumed
,
which
*NL*
is
easily
learned
by
counting
the
bits
of
tappa
distributed
at
regular
*NL*
intervals
along
the
string
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
grieve
to
state
so
distressing
a
fact
,
but
the
inhabitants
of
*NL*
Typee
were
in
the
habit
of
devouring
fish
much
in
the
same
way
that
*NL*
a
civilized
being
would
eat
a
radish
,
and
without
any
more
previous
*NL*
preparation
.
They
eat
it
raw
;
scales
,
bones
,
gills
,
and
all
the
inside
.
*NL*
The
fish
is
held
by
the
tail
,
and
the
head
being
introduced
into
the
*NL*
mouth
,
the
animal
disappears
with
a
rapidity
that
would
at
first
nearly
*NL*
lead
one
to
imagine
it
had
been
launched
bodily
down
the
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raw
fish
!
Shall
I
ever
forget
my
sensations
when
I
first
saw
my
island
*NL*
beauty
devour
one
.
Oh
,
heavens
!
Fayaway
,
how
could
you
ever
have
*NL*
contracted
so
vile
a
habit
?
However
,
after
the
first
shock
had
subsided
,
*NL*
the
custom
grew
less
odious
in
my
eyes
,
and
I
soon
accustomed
myself
to
*NL*
the
sight
.
Let
no
one
imagine
,
however
,
that
the
lovely
Fayaway
was
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
swallowing
great
vulgar-looking
fishes
:
oh
,
no
;
with
her
*NL*
beautiful
small
hand
she
would
clasp
a
delicate
,
little
,
golden-hued
*NL*
love
of
a
fish
and
eat
it
as
elegantly
and
as
innocently
as
though
it
*NL*
were
a
Naples
biscuit
.
But
alas
!
it
was
after
all
a
raw
fish
;
and
all
I
*NL*
can
say
is
,
that
Fayaway
ate
it
in
a
more
ladylike
manner
than
any
other
*NL*
girl
of
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
at
Rome
do
as
the
Romans
do
,
I
held
to
be
so
good
a
proverb
,
that
*NL*
being
in
Typee
I
made
a
point
of
doing
as
the
Typees
did
.
Thus
I
*NL*
ate
poee-poee
as
they
did
;
I
walked
about
in
a
garb
striking
for
its
*NL*
simplicity
;
and
I
reposed
on
a
community
of
couches
;
besides
doing
many
*NL*
other
things
in
conformity
with
their
peculiar
habits
;
but
the
farthest
*NL*
I
ever
went
in
the
way
of
conformity
,
was
on
several
occasions
to
regale
*NL*
myself
with
raw
fish
.
These
being
remarkably
tender
,
and
quite
small
,
*NL*
the
undertaking
was
not
so
disagreeable
in
the
main
,
and
after
a
few
*NL*
trials
I
positively
began
to
relish
them
;
however
,
I
subjected
them
to
a
*NL*
slight
operation
with
a
knife
previously
to
making
my
repast
.

*NL*
*NL*
I
THINK
I
must
enlighten
the
reader
a
little
about
the
natural
history
*NL*
of
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whence
,
in
the
name
of
Count
Buffon
and
Baron
Cuvier
,
came
those
dogs
*NL*
that
I
saw
in
Typee
?
Dogs
!
--
Big
hairless
rats
rather
;
all
with
smooth
,
*NL*
shining
speckled
hides
--
fat
sides
,
and
very
disagreeable
faces
.
Whence
*NL*
could
they
have
come
?
That
they
were
not
the
indigenous
production
of
*NL*
the
region
,
I
am
firmly
convinced
.
Indeed
they
seemed
aware
of
their
*NL*
being
interlopers
,
looking
fairly
ashamed
,
and
always
trying
to
hide
*NL*
themselves
in
some
dark
corner
.
It
was
plain
enough
they
did
not
feel
at
*NL*
home
in
the
vale
--
that
they
wished
themselves
well
out
of
it
,
and
back
*NL*
to
the
ugly
country
from
which
they
must
have
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scurvy
curs
!
they
were
my
abhorrence
;
I
should
have
liked
nothing
*NL*
better
than
to
have
been
the
death
of
every
one
of
them
.
In
fact
,
on
one
*NL*
occasion
,
I
intimated
the
propriety
of
a
canine
crusade
to
Mehevi
;
but
*NL*
the
benevolent
king
would
not
consent
to
it
.
He
heard
me
very
patiently
;
*NL*
but
when
I
had
finished
,
shook
his
head
,
and
told
me
in
confidence
that
*NL*
they
were
`
taboo
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
animal
that
made
the
fortune
of
the
ex-lord-mayor
*NL*
Whittington
,
I
shall
never
forget
the
day
that
I
was
lying
in
the
house
*NL*
about
noon
,
everybody
else
being
fast
asleep
;
and
happening
to
raise
*NL*
my
eyes
,
met
those
of
a
big
black
spectral
cat
,
which
sat
erect
in
the
*NL*
doorway
,
looking
at
me
with
its
frightful
goggling
green
orbs
,
like
one
*NL*
of
those
monstrous
imps
that
torment
some
of
Teniers
'
saints
!
I
am
one
*NL*
of
those
unfortunate
persons
to
whom
the
sight
of
these
animals
are
,
at
*NL*
any
time
an
insufferable
annoyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
constitutionally
averse
to
cats
in
general
,
the
unexpected
*NL*
apparition
of
this
one
in
particular
utterly
confounded
me
.
When
I
had
*NL*
a
little
recovered
from
the
fascination
of
its
glance
,
I
started
up
;
the
*NL*
cat
fled
,
and
emboldened
by
this
,
I
rushed
out
of
the
house
in
pursuit
;
*NL*
but
it
had
disappeared
.
It
was
the
only
time
I
ever
saw
one
in
the
*NL*
valley
,
and
how
it
got
there
I
can
not
imagine
.
It
is
just
possible
that
*NL*
it
might
have
escaped
from
one
of
the
ships
at
Nukuheva
.
It
was
in
vain
*NL*
to
seek
information
on
the
subject
from
the
natives
,
since
none
of
them
*NL*
had
seen
the
animal
,
the
appearance
of
which
remains
a
mystery
to
me
to
*NL*
this
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
few
animals
which
are
to
be
met
with
in
Typee
,
there
was
none
*NL*
which
I
looked
upon
with
more
interest
than
a
beautiful
golden-hued
*NL*
species
of
lizard
.
It
measured
perhaps
five
inches
from
head
to
tail
,
*NL*
and
was
most
gracefully
proportioned
.
Numbers
of
those
creatures
were
*NL*
to
be
seen
basking
in
the
sunshine
upon
the
thatching
of
the
houses
,
and
*NL*
multitudes
at
all
hours
of
the
day
showed
their
glittering
sides
as
they
*NL*
ran
frolicking
between
the
spears
of
grass
or
raced
in
troops
up
and
*NL*
down
the
tall
shafts
of
the
cocoanut
trees
.
But
the
remarkable
beauty
*NL*
of
these
little
animals
and
their
lively
ways
were
not
their
only
claims
*NL*
upon
my
admiration
.
They
were
perfectly
tame
and
insensible
to
fear
.
*NL*
Frequently
,
after
seating
myself
upon
the
ground
in
some
shady
place
*NL*
during
the
heat
of
the
day
,
I
would
be
completely
overrun
with
them
.
*NL*
If
I
brushed
one
off
my
arm
,
it
would
leap
perhaps
into
my
hair
:
when
I
*NL*
tried
to
frighten
it
away
by
gently
pinching
its
leg
,
it
would
turn
for
*NL*
protection
to
the
very
hand
that
attacked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
birds
are
also
remarkably
tame
.
If
you
happened
to
see
one
perched
*NL*
upon
a
branch
within
reach
of
your
arm
,
and
advanced
towards
it
,
it
did
*NL*
not
fly
away
immediately
,
but
waited
quietly
looking
at
you
,
until
you
*NL*
could
almost
touch
it
,
and
then
took
wing
slowly
,
less
alarmed
at
your
*NL*
presence
,
it
would
seem
,
than
desirous
of
removing
itself
from
your
*NL*
path
.
Had
salt
been
less
scarce
in
the
valley
than
it
was
,
this
was
the
*NL*
very
place
to
have
gone
birding
with
it
.
I
remember
that
once
,
on
an
*NL*
uninhabited
island
of
the
Gallipagos
,
a
bird
alighted
on
my
outstretched
*NL*
arm
,
while
its
mate
chirped
from
an
adjoining
tree
.
Its
tameness
,
far
*NL*
from
shocking
me
,
as
a
similar
occurrence
did
Selkirk
,
imparted
to
*NL*
me
the
most
exquisite
thrill
of
delight
I
ever
experienced
,
and
with
*NL*
somewhat
of
the
same
pleasure
did
I
afterwards
behold
the
birds
and
*NL*
lizards
of
the
valley
show
their
confidence
in
the
kindliness
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
numerous
afflictions
which
the
Europeans
have
entailed
upon
*NL*
some
of
the
natives
of
the
South
Seas
,
is
the
accidental
introduction
*NL*
among
them
of
that
enemy
of
all
repose
and
ruffler
of
even
tempers
--
the
*NL*
Mosquito
.
At
the
Sandwich
Islands
and
at
two
or
three
of
the
Society
*NL*
group
,
there
are
now
thriving
colonies
of
these
insects
,
who
promise
ere
*NL*
long
to
supplant
altogether
the
aboriginal
sand-flies
.
They
sting
,
buzz
,
*NL*
and
torment
,
from
one
end
of
the
year
to
the
other
,
and
by
incessantly
*NL*
exasperating
the
natives
materially
obstruct
the
benevolent
labours
of
*NL*
the
missionaries
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
grievous
visitation
,
however
the
Typees
are
as
yet
wholly
*NL*
exempt
;
but
its
place
is
unfortunately
in
some
degree
supplied
by
the
*NL*
occasional
presence
of
a
minute
species
of
fly
,
which
,
without
stinging
,
*NL*
is
nevertheless
productive
of
no
little
annoyance
.
The
tameness
of
the
*NL*
birds
and
lizards
is
as
nothing
when
compared
to
the
fearless
confidence
*NL*
of
this
insect
.
He
will
perch
upon
one
of
your
eye-lashes
,
and
go
to
*NL*
roost
there
if
you
do
not
disturb
him
,
or
force
his
way
through
your
*NL*
hair
,
or
along
the
cavity
of
the
nostril
,
till
you
almost
fancy
he
is
*NL*
resolved
to
explore
the
very
brain
itself
.
On
one
occasion
I
was
so
*NL*
inconsiderate
as
to
yawn
while
a
number
of
them
were
hovering
around
*NL*
me
.
I
never
repeated
the
act
.
Some
half-dozen
darted
into
the
open
*NL*
apartment
,
and
began
walking
about
its
ceiling
;
the
sensation
was
*NL*
dreadful
.
I
involuntarily
closed
my
mouth
,
and
the
poor
creatures
being
*NL*
enveloped
in
inner
darkness
,
must
in
their
consternation
have
stumbled
*NL*
over
my
palate
,
and
been
precipitated
into
the
gulf
beneath
.
At
any
*NL*
rate
,
though
I
afterwards
charitably
held
my
mouth
open
for
at
least
*NL*
five
minutes
,
with
a
view
of
affording
egress
to
the
stragglers
,
none
of
*NL*
them
ever
availed
themselves
of
the
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
no
wild
animals
of
any
kind
on
the
island
unless
it
be
decided
*NL*
that
the
natives
themselves
are
such
.
The
mountains
and
the
interior
*NL*
present
to
the
eye
nothing
but
silent
solitudes
,
unbroken
by
the
roar
*NL*
of
beasts
of
prey
,
and
enlivened
by
few
tokens
even
of
minute
animated
*NL*
existence
.
There
are
no
venomous
reptiles
,
and
no
snakes
of
any
*NL*
description
to
be
found
in
any
of
the
valleys
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
company
of
Marquesan
natives
the
weather
affords
no
topic
of
*NL*
conversation
.
It
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
any
vicissitudes
.
The
rainy
*NL*
season
,
it
is
true
,
brings
frequent
showers
,
but
they
are
intermitting
*NL*
and
refreshing
.
When
an
islander
bound
on
some
expedition
rises
from
his
*NL*
couch
in
the
morning
,
he
is
never
solicitous
to
peep
out
and
see
how
the
*NL*
sky
looks
,
or
ascertain
from
what
quarter
the
wind
blows
.
He
is
always
*NL*
sure
of
a
`
fine
day
'
,
and
the
promise
of
a
few
genial
showers
he
hails
*NL*
with
pleasure
.
There
is
never
any
of
that
`
remarkable
weather
'
on
the
*NL*
islands
which
from
time
immemorial
has
been
experienced
in
America
,
and
*NL*
still
continues
to
call
forth
the
wondering
conversational
exclamations
*NL*
of
its
elderly
citizens
.
Nor
do
there
even
occur
any
of
those
eccentric
*NL*
meteorological
changes
which
elsewhere
surprise
us
.
In
the
valley
of
*NL*
Typee
ice-creams
would
never
be
rendered
less
acceptable
by
sudden
*NL*
frosts
,
nor
would
picnic
parties
be
deferred
on
account
of
inauspicious
*NL*
snowstorms
:
for
there
day
follows
day
in
one
unvarying
round
of
summer
*NL*
and
sunshine
,
and
the
whole
year
is
one
long
tropical
month
of
June
just
*NL*
melting
into
July
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
this
genial
climate
which
causes
the
cocoanuts
to
flourish
as
they
*NL*
do
.
This
invaluable
fruit
,
brought
to
perfection
by
the
rich
soil
of
the
*NL*
Marquesas
,
and
home
aloft
on
a
stately
column
more
than
a
hundred
feet
*NL*
from
the
ground
,
would
seem
at
first
almost
inaccessible
to
the
simple
*NL*
natives
.
Indeed
the
slender
,
smooth
,
and
soaring
shaft
,
without
a
single
*NL*
limb
or
protuberance
of
any
kind
to
assist
one
in
mounting
it
,
presents
*NL*
an
obstacle
only
to
be
overcome
by
the
surprising
agility
and
ingenuity
*NL*
of
the
islanders
.
It
might
be
supposed
that
their
indolence
would
lead
*NL*
them
patiently
to
await
the
period
when
the
ripened
nuts
,
slowly
parting
*NL*
from
their
stems
,
fall
one
by
one
to
the
ground
.
This
certainly
would
*NL*
be
the
case
,
were
it
not
that
the
young
fruit
,
encased
in
a
soft
green
*NL*
husk
,
with
the
incipient
meat
adhering
in
a
jelly-like
pellicle
to
its
*NL*
sides
,
and
containing
a
bumper
of
the
most
delicious
nectar
,
is
what
*NL*
they
chiefly
prize
.
They
have
at
least
twenty
different
terms
to
express
*NL*
as
many
progressive
stages
in
the
growth
of
the
nut
.
Many
of
them
reject
*NL*
the
fruit
altogether
except
at
a
particular
period
of
its
growth
,
which
,
*NL*
incredible
as
it
may
appear
,
they
seemed
to
me
to
be
able
to
ascertain
*NL*
within
an
hour
or
two
.
Others
are
still
more
capricious
in
their
*NL*
tastes
;
and
after
gathering
together
a
heap
of
the
nuts
of
all
ages
,
and
*NL*
ingeniously
tapping
them
,
will
first
sip
from
one
and
then
from
another
,
*NL*
as
fastidiously
as
some
delicate
wine-bibber
experimenting
glass
in
hand
*NL*
among
his
dusty
demi-johns
of
different
vintages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
young
men
,
with
more
flexible
frames
than
their
comrades
,
*NL*
and
perhaps
with
more
courageous
souls
,
had
a
way
of
walking
up
*NL*
the
trunk
of
the
cocoanut
trees
which
to
me
seemed
little
less
than
*NL*
miraculous
;
and
when
looking
at
them
in
the
act
,
I
experienced
that
*NL*
curious
perplexity
a
child
feels
when
he
beholds
a
fly
moving
feet
*NL*
uppermost
along
a
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
will
endeavour
to
describe
the
way
in
which
Narnee
,
a
noble
young
*NL*
chief
,
sometimes
performed
this
feat
for
my
peculiar
gratification
;
but
*NL*
his
preliminary
performances
must
also
be
recorded
.
Upon
my
signifying
*NL*
my
desire
that
he
should
pluck
me
the
young
fruit
of
some
particular
*NL*
tree
,
the
handsome
savage
,
throwing
himself
into
a
sudden
attitude
of
*NL*
surprise
,
feigns
astonishment
at
the
apparent
absurdity
of
the
request
.
*NL*
Maintaining
this
position
for
a
moment
,
the
strange
emotions
depicted
on
*NL*
his
countenance
soften
down
into
one
of
humorous
resignation
to
my
will
,
*NL*
and
then
looking
wistfully
up
to
the
tufted
top
of
the
tree
,
he
*NL*
stands
on
tip-toe
,
straining
his
neck
and
elevating
his
arm
,
as
though
*NL*
endeavouring
to
reach
the
fruit
from
the
ground
where
he
stands
.
As
*NL*
if
defeated
in
this
childish
attempt
,
he
now
sinks
to
the
earth
*NL*
despondingly
,
beating
his
breast
in
well-acted
despair
;
and
then
,
*NL*
starting
to
his
feet
all
at
once
,
and
throwing
back
his
head
,
raises
*NL*
both
hands
,
like
a
school-boy
about
to
catch
a
falling
ball
.
After
*NL*
continuing
this
for
a
moment
or
two
,
as
if
in
expectation
that
the
fruit
*NL*
was
going
to
be
tossed
down
to
him
by
some
good
spirit
in
the
tree-top
,
*NL*
he
turns
wildly
round
in
another
fit
of
despair
,
and
scampers
off
to
the
*NL*
distance
of
thirty
or
forty
yards
.
Here
he
remains
awhile
,
eyeing
the
*NL*
tree
,
the
very
picture
of
misery
;
but
the
next
moment
,
receiving
,
as
it
*NL*
were
,
a
flash
of
inspiration
,
he
rushes
again
towards
it
,
and
clasping
*NL*
both
arms
about
the
trunk
,
with
one
elevated
a
little
above
the
other
,
*NL*
he
presses
the
soles
of
his
feet
close
together
against
the
tree
,
*NL*
extending
his
legs
from
it
until
they
are
nearly
horizontal
,
and
his
*NL*
body
becomes
doubled
into
an
arch
;
then
,
hand
over
hand
and
foot
over
*NL*
foot
,
he
rises
from
the
earth
with
steady
rapidity
,
and
almost
before
*NL*
you
are
aware
of
it
,
has
gained
the
cradled
and
embowered
nest
of
nuts
,
*NL*
and
with
boisterous
glee
flings
the
fruit
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
mode
of
walking
the
tree
is
only
practicable
where
the
trunk
*NL*
declines
considerably
from
the
perpendicular
.
This
,
however
,
is
almost
*NL*
always
the
case
;
some
of
the
perfectly
straight
shafts
of
the
trees
*NL*
leaning
at
an
angle
of
thirty
degrees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
less
active
among
the
men
,
and
many
of
the
children
of
the
valley
*NL*
have
another
method
of
climbing
.
They
take
a
broad
and
stout
piece
of
*NL*
bark
,
and
secure
each
end
of
it
to
their
ankles
,
so
that
when
the
feet
*NL*
thus
confined
are
extended
apart
,
a
space
of
little
more
than
twelve
*NL*
inches
is
left
between
them
.
This
contrivance
greatly
facilitates
*NL*
the
act
of
climbing
.
The
band
pressed
against
the
tree
,
and
closely
*NL*
embracing
it
,
yields
a
pretty
firm
support
;
while
with
the
arms
clasped
*NL*
about
the
trunk
,
and
at
regular
intervals
sustaining
the
body
,
the
feet
*NL*
are
drawn
up
nearly
a
yard
at
a
time
,
and
a
corresponding
elevation
of
*NL*
the
hands
immediately
succeeds
.
In
this
way
I
have
seen
little
children
,
*NL*
scarcely
five
years
of
age
,
fearlessly
climbing
the
slender
pole
of
*NL*
a
young
cocoanut
tree
,
and
while
hanging
perhaps
fifty
feet
from
the
*NL*
ground
,
receiving
the
plaudits
of
their
parents
beneath
,
who
clapped
*NL*
their
hands
,
and
encouraged
them
to
mount
still
higher
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
,
thought
I
,
on
first
witnessing
one
of
these
exhibitions
,
would
*NL*
the
nervous
mothers
of
America
and
England
say
to
a
similar
display
of
*NL*
hardihood
in
any
of
their
children
?
The
Lacedemonian
nation
might
have
*NL*
approved
of
it
,
but
most
modern
dames
would
have
gone
into
hysterics
at
*NL*
the
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
top
of
the
cocoanut
tree
the
numerous
branches
,
radiating
on
*NL*
all
sides
from
a
common
centre
,
form
a
sort
of
green
and
waving
*NL*
basket
,
between
the
leaflets
of
which
you
just
discern
the
nuts
thickly
*NL*
clustering
together
,
and
on
the
loftier
trees
looking
no
bigger
from
*NL*
the
ground
than
bunches
of
grapes
.
I
remember
one
adventurous
little
*NL*
fellow
--
Too-Too
was
the
rascal
's
name
--
who
had
built
himself
a
sort
of
*NL*
aerial
baby-house
in
the
picturesque
tuft
of
a
tree
adjoining
Marheyo
's
*NL*
habitation
.
He
used
to
spend
hours
there
,
--
rustling
among
the
branches
,
*NL*
and
shouting
with
delight
every
time
the
strong
gusts
of
wind
rushing
*NL*
down
from
the
mountain
side
,
swayed
to
and
fro
the
tall
and
flexible
*NL*
column
on
which
he
was
perched
.
Whenever
I
heard
Too-Too
's
musical
voice
*NL*
sounding
strangely
to
the
ear
from
so
great
a
height
,
and
beheld
him
*NL*
peeping
down
upon
me
from
out
his
leafy
covert
,
he
always
recalled
to
my
*NL*
mind
Dibdin
's
lines
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
a
sweet
little
cherub
that
sits
up
aloft
,
*NL*
To
look
out
for
the
life
of
poor
Jack
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Birds
--
bright
and
beautiful
birds
--
fly
over
the
valley
of
Typee
.
You
*NL*
see
them
perched
aloft
among
the
immovable
boughs
of
the
majestic
*NL*
bread-fruit
trees
,
or
gently
swaying
on
the
elastic
branches
of
the
*NL*
Omoo
;
skimming
over
the
palmetto
thatching
of
the
bamboo
huts
;
passing
*NL*
like
spirits
on
the
wing
through
the
shadows
of
the
grove
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
descending
into
the
bosom
of
the
valley
in
gleaming
flights
from
the
*NL*
mountains
.
Their
plumage
is
purple
and
azure
,
crimson
and
white
,
black
*NL*
and
gold
;
with
bills
of
every
tint
:
bright
bloody
red
,
jet
black
,
and
*NL*
ivory
white
,
and
their
eyes
are
bright
and
sparkling
;
they
go
sailing
*NL*
through
the
air
in
starry
throngs
;
but
,
alas
!
the
spell
of
dumbness
is
*NL*
upon
them
all
--
there
is
not
a
single
warbler
in
the
valley
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
not
why
it
was
,
but
the
sight
of
these
birds
,
generally
the
*NL*
ministers
of
gladness
,
always
oppressed
me
with
melancholy
.
As
in
their
*NL*
dumb
beauty
they
hovered
by
me
whilst
I
was
walking
,
or
looked
down
upon
*NL*
me
with
steady
curious
eyes
from
out
the
foliage
,
I
was
almost
inclined
*NL*
to
fancy
that
they
knew
they
were
gazing
upon
a
stranger
,
and
that
they
*NL*
commiserated
his
fate
.

A
*NL*
FEW
THOUGHTS
ON
THE
TYPEE
DIALECT
*NL*
*NL*
IN
one
of
my
strolls
with
Kory-Kory
,
in
passing
along
the
border
of
a
*NL*
thick
growth
of
bushes
,
my
attention
was
arrested
by
a
singular
noise
.
*NL*
On
entering
the
thicket
I
witnessed
for
the
first
time
the
operation
of
*NL*
tattooing
as
performed
by
these
islanders
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
beheld
a
man
extended
flat
upon
his
back
on
the
ground
,
and
,
despite
*NL*
the
forced
composure
of
his
countenance
,
it
was
evident
that
he
was
*NL*
suffering
agony
.
His
tormentor
bent
over
him
,
working
away
for
all
the
*NL*
world
like
a
stone-cutter
with
mallet
and
chisel
.
In
one
hand
he
held
a
*NL*
short
slender
stick
,
pointed
with
a
shark
's
tooth
,
on
the
upright
end
of
*NL*
which
he
tapped
with
a
small
hammer-like
piece
of
wood
,
thus
puncturing
*NL*
the
skin
,
and
charging
it
with
the
colouring
matter
in
which
the
*NL*
instrument
was
dipped
.
A
cocoanut
shell
containing
this
fluid
was
placed
*NL*
upon
the
ground
.
It
is
prepared
by
mixing
with
a
vegetable
juice
the
*NL*
ashes
of
the
`
armor
'
,
or
candle-nut
,
always
preserved
for
the
purpose
.
*NL*
Beside
the
savage
,
and
spread
out
upon
a
piece
of
soiled
tappa
,
were
*NL*
a
great
number
of
curious
black-looking
little
implements
of
bone
and
*NL*
wood
,
used
in
the
various
divisions
of
his
art
.
A
few
terminated
in
a
*NL*
single
fine
point
,
and
,
like
very
delicate
pencils
,
were
employed
in
*NL*
giving
the
finishing
touches
,
or
in
operating
upon
the
more
sensitive
*NL*
portions
of
the
body
,
as
was
the
case
in
the
present
instance
.
Others
*NL*
presented
several
points
distributed
in
a
line
,
somewhat
resembling
the
*NL*
teeth
of
a
saw
.
These
were
employed
in
the
coarser
parts
of
the
work
,
*NL*
and
particularly
in
pricking
in
straight
marks
.
Some
presented
their
*NL*
points
disposed
in
small
figures
,
and
being
placed
upon
the
body
,
*NL*
were
,
by
a
single
blow
of
the
hammer
,
made
to
leave
their
indelible
*NL*
impression
.
I
observed
a
few
the
handles
of
which
were
mysteriously
*NL*
curved
,
as
if
intended
to
be
introduced
into
the
orifice
of
the
ear
,
*NL*
with
a
view
perhaps
of
beating
the
tattoo
upon
the
tympanum
.
Altogether
*NL*
the
sight
of
these
strange
instruments
recalled
to
mind
that
display
*NL*
of
cruel-looking
mother-of-pearl-handled
things
which
one
sees
in
their
*NL*
velvet-lined
cases
at
the
elbow
of
a
dentist
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
artist
was
not
at
this
time
engaged
on
an
original
sketch
,
his
*NL*
subject
being
a
venerable
savage
,
whose
tattooing
had
become
somewhat
*NL*
faded
with
age
and
needed
a
few
repairs
,
and
accordingly
he
was
merely
*NL*
employed
in
touching
up
the
works
of
some
of
the
old
masters
of
the
*NL*
Typee
school
,
as
delineated
upon
the
human
canvas
before
him
.
The
parts
*NL*
operated
upon
were
the
eyelids
,
where
a
longitudinal
streak
,
like
the
*NL*
one
which
adorned
Kory-Kory
,
crossed
the
countenance
of
the
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
the
poor
old
man
,
sundry
twitchings
and
*NL*
screwings
of
the
muscles
of
the
face
denoted
the
exquisite
sensibility
*NL*
of
these
shutters
to
the
windows
of
his
soul
,
which
he
was
now
having
*NL*
repainted
.
But
the
artist
,
with
a
heart
as
callous
as
that
of
an
army
*NL*
surgeon
,
continued
his
performance
,
enlivening
his
labours
with
a
wild
*NL*
chant
,
tapping
away
the
while
as
merrily
as
a
woodpecker
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
deeply
engaged
was
he
in
his
work
,
that
he
had
not
observed
our
*NL*
approach
,
until
,
after
having
,
enjoyed
an
unmolested
view
of
the
*NL*
operation
,
I
chose
to
attract
his
attention
.
As
soon
as
he
perceived
me
,
*NL*
supposing
that
I
sought
him
in
his
professional
capacity
,
he
seized
hold
*NL*
of
me
in
a
paroxysm
of
delight
,
and
was
an
eagerness
to
begin
the
work
.
*NL*
When
,
however
,
I
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
had
altogether
mistaken
*NL*
my
views
,
nothing
could
exceed
his
grief
and
disappointment
.
But
*NL*
recovering
from
this
,
he
seemed
determined
not
to
credit
my
assertion
,
*NL*
and
grasping
his
implements
,
he
flourished
them
about
in
fearful
*NL*
vicinity
to
my
face
,
going
through
an
imaginary
performance
of
his
art
,
*NL*
and
every
moment
bursting
into
some
admiring
exclamation
at
the
beauty
*NL*
of
his
designs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Horrified
at
the
bare
thought
of
being
rendered
hideous
for
life
if
the
*NL*
wretch
were
to
execute
his
purpose
upon
me
,
I
struggled
to
get
away
*NL*
from
him
,
while
Kory-Kory
,
turning
traitor
,
stood
by
,
and
besought
me
*NL*
to
comply
with
the
outrageous
request
.
On
my
reiterated
refusals
the
*NL*
excited
artist
got
half
beside
himself
,
and
was
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
*NL*
at
losing
so
noble
an
opportunity
of
distinguishing
himself
in
his
*NL*
profession
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
of
engrafting
his
tattooing
upon
my
white
skin
filled
him
*NL*
with
all
a
painter
's
enthusiasm
;
again
and
again
he
gazed
into
my
*NL*
countenance
,
and
every
fresh
glimpse
seemed
to
add
to
the
vehemence
*NL*
of
his
ambition
.
Not
knowing
to
what
extremities
he
might
proceed
,
*NL*
and
shuddering
at
the
ruin
he
might
inflict
upon
my
figure-head
,
I
now
*NL*
endeavoured
to
draw
off
his
attention
from
it
,
and
holding
out
my
arm
*NL*
in
a
fit
of
desperation
,
signed
to
him
to
commence
operations
.
But
he
*NL*
rejected
the
compromise
indignantly
,
and
still
continued
his
attack
on
*NL*
my
face
,
as
though
nothing
short
of
that
would
satisfy
him
.
When
his
*NL*
forefinger
swept
across
my
features
,
in
laying
out
the
borders
of
those
*NL*
parallel
bands
which
were
to
encircle
my
countenance
,
the
flesh
fairly
*NL*
crawled
upon
my
bones
.
At
last
,
half
wild
with
terror
and
indignation
,
I
*NL*
succeeded
in
breaking
away
from
the
three
savages
,
and
fled
towards
old
*NL*
Marheyo
's
house
,
pursued
by
the
indomitable
artist
,
who
ran
after
me
,
*NL*
implements
in
hand
.
Kory-Kory
,
however
,
at
last
interfered
and
drew
him
*NL*
off
from
the
chase
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
incident
opened
my
eyes
to
a
new
danger
;
and
I
now
felt
convinced
*NL*
that
in
some
luckless
hour
I
should
be
disfigured
in
such
a
manner
as
*NL*
never
more
to
have
the
FACE
to
return
to
my
countrymen
,
even
should
an
*NL*
opportunity
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
apprehensions
were
greatly
increased
by
the
desire
which
King
*NL*
Mehevi
and
several
of
the
inferior
chiefs
now
manifested
that
I
should
*NL*
be
tattooed
.
The
pleasure
of
the
king
was
first
signified
to
me
some
*NL*
three
days
after
my
casual
encounter
with
Karky
the
artist
.
Heavens
!
*NL*
what
imprecations
I
showered
upon
that
Karky
.
Doubtless
he
had
plotted
a
*NL*
conspiracy
against
me
and
my
countenance
,
and
would
never
rest
until
his
*NL*
diabolical
purpose
was
accomplished
.
Several
times
I
met
him
in
various
*NL*
parts
of
the
valley
,
and
,
invariably
,
whenever
he
descried
me
,
he
came
*NL*
running
after
me
with
his
mallet
and
chisel
,
flourishing
them
about
my
*NL*
face
as
if
he
longed
to
begin
.
What
an
object
he
would
have
made
of
me
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
king
first
expressed
his
wish
to
me
,
I
made
known
to
him
my
*NL*
utter
abhorrence
of
the
measure
,
and
worked
myself
into
such
a
state
of
*NL*
excitement
,
that
he
absolutely
stared
at
me
in
amazement
.
It
evidently
*NL*
surpassed
his
majesty
's
comprehension
how
any
sober-minded
and
*NL*
sensible
individual
could
entertain
the
least
possible
objection
to
so
*NL*
beautifying
an
operation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
afterwards
he
repeated
his
suggestion
,
and
meeting
with
a
little
*NL*
repulse
,
showed
some
symptoms
of
displeasure
at
my
obduracy
.
On
his
a
*NL*
third
time
renewing
his
request
,
I
plainly
perceived
that
something
must
*NL*
be
done
,
or
my
visage
was
ruined
for
ever
;
I
therefore
screwed
up
my
*NL*
courage
to
the
sticking
point
,
and
declared
my
willingness
to
have
both
*NL*
arms
tattooed
from
just
above
the
wrist
to
the
shoulder
.
His
majesty
was
*NL*
greatly
pleased
at
the
proposition
,
and
I
was
congratulating
myself
with
*NL*
having
thus
compromised
the
matter
,
when
he
intimated
that
as
a
thing
of
*NL*
course
my
face
was
first
to
undergo
the
operation
.
I
was
fairly
driven
*NL*
to
despair
;
nothing
but
the
utter
ruin
of
my
`
face
divine
'
,
as
the
*NL*
poets
call
it
,
would
,
I
perceived
,
satisfy
the
inexorable
Mehevi
and
his
*NL*
chiefs
,
or
rather
,
that
infernal
Karky
,
for
he
was
at
the
bottom
of
it
*NL*
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
consolation
afforded
me
was
a
choice
of
patterns
:
I
was
at
*NL*
perfect
liberty
to
have
my
face
spanned
by
three
horizontal
bars
,
after
*NL*
the
fashion
of
my
serving-man
's
;
or
to
have
as
many
oblique
stripes
*NL*
slanting
across
it
;
or
if
,
like
a
true
courtier
,
I
chose
to
model
my
*NL*
style
on
that
of
royalty
,
I
might
wear
a
sort
of
freemason
badge
upon
*NL*
my
countenance
in
the
shape
of
a
mystic
triangle
.
However
,
I
would
have
*NL*
none
of
these
,
though
the
king
most
earnestly
impressed
upon
my
mind
*NL*
that
my
choice
was
wholly
unrestricted
.
At
last
,
seeing
my
unconquerable
*NL*
repugnance
,
he
ceased
to
importune
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
so
some
other
of
the
savages
.
Hardly
a
day
passed
but
I
was
*NL*
subjected
to
their
annoying
requests
,
until
at
last
my
existence
*NL*
became
a
burden
to
me
;
the
pleasures
I
had
previously
enjoyed
no
longer
*NL*
afforded
me
delight
,
and
all
my
former
desire
to
escape
from
the
valley
*NL*
now
revived
with
additional
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fact
which
I
soon
afterwards
learned
augmented
my
apprehension
.
The
*NL*
whole
system
of
tattooing
was
,
I
found
,
connected
with
their
religion
;
*NL*
and
it
was
evident
,
therefore
,
that
they
were
resolved
to
make
a
convert
*NL*
of
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
decoration
of
the
chiefs
it
seems
to
be
necessary
to
exercise
the
*NL*
most
elaborate
pencilling
;
while
some
of
the
inferior
natives
looked
*NL*
as
if
they
had
been
daubed
over
indiscriminately
with
a
house-painter
's
*NL*
brush
.
I
remember
one
fellow
who
prided
himself
hugely
upon
a
great
*NL*
oblong
patch
,
placed
high
upon
his
back
,
and
who
always
reminded
me
of
*NL*
a
man
with
a
blister
of
Spanish
flies
,
stuck
between
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
Another
whom
I
frequently
met
had
the
hollow
of
his
eyes
tattooed
in
two
*NL*
regular
squares
and
his
visual
organs
being
remarkably
brilliant
,
they
*NL*
gleamed
forth
from
out
this
setting
like
a
couple
of
diamonds
inserted
*NL*
in
ebony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
convinced
that
tattooing
was
a
religious
observance
,
still
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
connection
between
it
and
the
superstitious
idolatry
of
*NL*
the
people
was
a
point
upon
which
I
could
never
obtain
any
information
.
*NL*
Like
the
still
more
important
system
of
the
`
Taboo
'
,
it
always
appeared
*NL*
inexplicable
to
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
marked
similarity
,
almost
an
identity
,
between
the
religious
*NL*
institutions
of
most
of
the
Polynesian
islands
,
and
in
all
exists
the
*NL*
mysterious
`
Taboo
'
,
restricted
in
its
uses
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
.
*NL*
So
strange
and
complex
in
its
arrangements
is
this
remarkable
system
,
*NL*
that
I
have
in
several
cases
met
with
individuals
who
,
after
residing
*NL*
for
years
among
the
islands
in
the
Pacific
,
and
acquiring
a
considerable
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
language
,
have
nevertheless
been
altogether
unable
to
*NL*
give
any
satisfactory
account
of
its
operations
.
Situated
as
I
was
*NL*
in
the
Typee
valley
,
I
perceived
every
hour
the
effects
of
this
*NL*
all-controlling
power
,
without
in
the
least
comprehending
it
.
Those
*NL*
effects
were
,
indeed
,
wide-spread
and
universal
,
pervading
the
most
*NL*
important
as
well
as
the
minutest
transactions
of
life
.
The
savage
,
in
*NL*
short
,
lives
in
the
continual
observance
of
its
dictates
,
which
guide
*NL*
and
control
every
action
of
his
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
days
after
entering
the
valley
I
had
been
saluted
at
least
*NL*
fifty
times
in
the
twenty-four
hours
with
the
talismanic
word
`
Taboo
'
*NL*
shrieked
in
my
ears
,
at
some
gross
violation
of
its
provisions
,
of
which
*NL*
I
had
unconsciously
been
guilty
.
The
day
after
our
arrival
I
happened
to
*NL*
hand
some
tobacco
to
Toby
over
the
head
of
a
native
who
sat
between
*NL*
us
.
He
started
up
,
as
if
stung
by
an
adder
;
while
the
whole
company
,
*NL*
manifesting
an
equal
degree
of
horror
,
simultaneously
screamed
out
*NL*
`
Taboo
!
'
I
never
again
perpetrated
a
similar
piece
of
ill-manners
,
*NL*
which
,
indeed
,
was
forbidden
by
the
canons
of
good
breeding
,
as
well
as
*NL*
by
the
mandates
of
the
taboo
.
But
it
was
not
always
so
easy
to
perceive
*NL*
wherein
you
had
contravened
the
spirit
of
this
institution
.
I
was
many
*NL*
times
called
to
order
,
if
I
may
use
the
phrase
,
when
I
could
not
for
the
*NL*
life
of
me
conjecture
what
particular
offence
I
had
committed
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
I
was
strolling
through
a
secluded
portion
of
the
valley
,
and
*NL*
hearing
the
musical
sound
of
the
cloth-mallet
at
a
little
distance
,
I
*NL*
turned
down
a
path
that
conducted
me
in
a
few
moments
to
a
house
where
*NL*
there
were
some
half-dozen
girls
employed
in
making
tappa
.
This
was
an
*NL*
operation
I
had
frequently
witnessed
,
and
had
handled
the
bark
in
all
*NL*
the
various
stages
of
its
preparation
.
On
the
present
occasion
the
*NL*
females
were
intent
upon
their
occupation
,
and
after
looking
up
and
*NL*
talking
gaily
to
me
for
a
few
moments
,
they
resumed
their
employment
.
I
*NL*
regarded
them
for
a
while
in
silence
,
and
then
carelessly
picking
up
a
*NL*
handful
of
the
material
that
lay
around
,
proceeded
unconsciously
to
pick
*NL*
it
apart
.
While
thus
engaged
,
I
was
suddenly
startled
by
a
scream
,
like
*NL*
that
of
a
whole
boarding-school
of
young
ladies
just
on
the
point
of
*NL*
going
into
hysterics
.
Leaping
up
with
the
idea
of
seeing
a
score
of
*NL*
Happar
warriors
about
to
perform
anew
the
Sabine
atrocity
,
I
found
*NL*
myself
confronted
by
the
company
of
girls
,
who
,
having
dropped
their
*NL*
work
,
stood
before
me
with
starting
eyes
,
swelling
bosoms
,
and
fingers
*NL*
pointed
in
horror
towards
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
that
some
venomous
reptile
must
be
concealed
in
the
bark
which
*NL*
I
held
in
my
hand
,
I
began
cautiously
to
separate
and
examine
it
.
Whilst
*NL*
I
did
so
the
horrified
girls
re-doubled
their
shrieks
.
Their
wild
cries
*NL*
and
frightened
motions
actually
alarmed
me
,
and
throwing
down
the
tappa
,
*NL*
I
was
about
to
rush
from
the
house
,
when
in
the
same
instant
their
*NL*
clamours
ceased
,
and
one
of
them
,
seizing
me
by
the
arm
,
pointed
to
the
*NL*
broken
fibres
that
had
just
fallen
from
my
grasp
,
and
screamed
in
my
*NL*
ears
the
fatal
word
Taboo
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
subsequently
found
out
that
the
fabric
they
were
engaged
in
making
was
*NL*
of
a
peculiar
kind
,
destined
to
be
worn
on
the
heads
of
the
females
,
and
*NL*
through
every
stage
of
its
manufacture
was
guarded
by
a
rigorous
taboo
,
*NL*
which
interdicted
the
whole
masculine
gender
from
even
so
much
as
*NL*
touching
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frequently
in
walking
through
the
groves
I
observed
bread-fruit
and
*NL*
cocoanut
trees
,
with
a
wreath
of
leaves
twined
in
a
peculiar
fashion
*NL*
about
their
trunks
.
This
was
the
mark
of
the
taboo
.
The
trees
*NL*
themselves
,
their
fruit
,
and
even
the
shadows
they
cast
upon
the
ground
,
*NL*
were
consecrated
by
its
presence
.
In
the
same
way
a
pipe
,
which
the
king
*NL*
had
bestowed
upon
me
,
was
rendered
sacred
in
the
eyes
of
the
natives
,
*NL*
none
of
whom
could
I
ever
prevail
upon
to
smoke
from
it
.
The
bowl
was
*NL*
encircled
by
a
woven
band
of
grass
,
somewhat
resembling
those
Turks
'
*NL*
heads
occasionally
worked
in
the
handles
of
our
whip-stalks
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
similar
badge
was
once
braided
about
my
wrist
by
the
royal
hand
*NL*
of
Mehevi
himself
,
who
,
as
soon
as
he
had
concluded
the
operation
,
*NL*
pronounced
me
`
Taboo
'
.
This
occurred
shortly
after
Toby
's
disappearance
;
*NL*
and
,
were
it
not
that
from
the
first
moment
I
had
entered
the
valley
*NL*
the
natives
had
treated
me
with
uniform
kindness
,
I
should
have
supposed
*NL*
that
their
conduct
afterwards
was
to
be
ascribed
to
the
fact
that
I
had
*NL*
received
this
sacred
investiture
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
capricious
operations
of
the
taboo
are
not
its
least
remarkable
*NL*
feature
:
to
enumerate
them
all
would
be
impossible
.
Black
hogs
--
infants
*NL*
to
a
certain
age
--
women
in
an
interesting
situation
--
young
men
while
the
*NL*
operation
of
tattooing
their
faces
is
going
on
--
and
certain
parts
of
the
*NL*
valley
during
the
continuance
of
a
shower
--
are
alike
fenced
about
by
the
*NL*
operation
of
the
taboo
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
witnessed
a
striking
instance
of
its
effects
in
the
bay
of
Tior
,
*NL*
my
visit
to
which
place
has
been
alluded
to
in
a
former
part
of
this
*NL*
narrative
.
On
that
occasion
our
worthy
captain
formed
one
of
the
party
.
*NL*
He
was
a
most
insatiable
sportsman
.
Outward
bound
,
and
off
the
pitch
of
*NL*
Cape
Horn
,
he
used
to
sit
on
the
taffrail
,
and
keep
the
steward
loading
*NL*
three
or
four
old
fowling
pieces
,
with
which
he
would
bring
down
*NL*
albatrosses
,
Cape
pigeons
,
jays
,
petrels
,
and
divers
other
marine
fowl
,
*NL*
who
followed
chattering
in
our
wake
.
The
sailors
were
struck
aghast
at
*NL*
his
impiety
,
and
one
and
all
attributed
our
forty
days
'
beating
about
*NL*
that
horrid
headland
to
his
sacrilegious
slaughter
of
these
inoffensive
*NL*
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Tior
he
evinced
the
same
disregard
for
the
religious
prejudices
of
*NL*
the
islanders
,
as
he
had
previously
shown
for
the
superstitions
of
the
*NL*
sailors
.
Having
heard
that
there
were
a
considerable
number
of
fowls
in
*NL*
the
valley
the
progeny
of
some
cocks
and
hens
accidentally
left
there
by
*NL*
an
English
vessel
,
and
which
,
being
strictly
tabooed
,
flew
about
almost
*NL*
in
a
wild
state
--
he
determined
to
break
through
all
restraints
,
and
*NL*
be
the
death
of
them
.
Accordingly
,
he
provided
himself
with
a
most
*NL*
formidable
looking
gun
,
and
announced
his
landing
on
the
beach
by
*NL*
shooting
down
a
noble
cock
that
was
crowing
what
proved
to
be
his
own
*NL*
funeral
dirge
,
on
the
limb
of
an
adjoining
tree
.
`
Taboo
'
,
shrieked
the
*NL*
affrighted
savages
.
`
Oh
,
hang
your
taboo
,
'
says
the
nautical
sportsman
;
*NL*
`
talk
taboo
to
the
marines
'
;
and
bang
went
the
piece
again
,
and
down
*NL*
came
another
victim
.
At
this
the
natives
ran
scampering
through
the
*NL*
groves
,
horror-struck
at
the
enormity
of
the
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
afternoon
the
rocky
sides
of
the
valley
rang
with
successive
*NL*
reports
,
and
the
superb
plumage
of
many
a
beautiful
fowl
was
ruffled
by
*NL*
the
fatal
bullet
.
Had
it
not
been
that
the
French
admiral
,
with
a
large
*NL*
party
,
was
then
in
the
glen
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
the
natives
,
although
*NL*
their
tribe
was
small
and
dispirited
,
would
have
inflicted
summary
*NL*
vengeance
upon
the
man
who
thus
outraged
their
most
sacred
institutions
;
*NL*
as
it
was
,
they
contrived
to
annoy
him
not
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thirsting
with
his
exertions
,
the
skipper
directed
his
steps
to
*NL*
a
stream
;
but
the
savages
,
who
had
followed
at
a
little
distance
,
*NL*
perceiving
his
object
,
rushed
towards
him
and
forced
him
away
from
its
*NL*
bank
--
his
lips
would
have
polluted
it
.
Wearied
at
last
,
he
sought
to
*NL*
enter
a
house
that
he
might
rest
for
a
while
on
the
mats
;
its
inmates
*NL*
gathered
tumultuously
about
the
door
and
denied
him
admittance
.
He
*NL*
coaxed
and
blustered
by
turns
,
but
in
vain
;
the
natives
were
neither
*NL*
to
be
intimidated
nor
appeased
,
and
as
a
final
resort
he
was
obliged
*NL*
to
call
together
his
boat
's
crew
,
and
pull
away
from
what
he
termed
the
*NL*
most
infernal
place
he
ever
stepped
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lucky
was
it
for
him
and
for
us
that
we
were
not
honoured
on
our
*NL*
departure
by
a
salute
of
stones
from
the
hands
of
the
exasperated
Tiors
.
*NL*
In
this
way
,
on
the
neighbouring
island
of
Ropo
,
were
killed
,
but
a
few
*NL*
weeks
previously
,
and
for
a
nearly
similar
offence
,
the
master
and
three
*NL*
of
the
crew
of
the
K
--
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
determine
with
anything
approaching
to
certainty
,
what
power
*NL*
it
is
that
imposes
the
taboo
.
When
I
consider
the
slight
disparity
*NL*
of
condition
among
the
islanders
--
the
very
limited
and
inconsiderable
*NL*
prerogatives
of
the
king
and
chiefs
--
and
the
loose
and
indefinite
*NL*
functions
of
the
priesthood
,
most
of
whom
were
hardly
to
be
*NL*
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
their
countrymen
,
I
am
wholly
at
a
loss
*NL*
where
to
look
for
the
authority
which
regulates
this
potent
institution
.
*NL*
It
is
imposed
upon
something
today
,
and
withdrawn
tomorrow
;
while
its
*NL*
operations
in
other
cases
are
perpetual
.
Sometimes
its
restrictions
only
*NL*
affect
a
single
individual
--
sometimes
a
particular
family
--
sometimes
*NL*
a
whole
tribe
;
and
in
a
few
instances
they
extend
not
merely
over
the
*NL*
various
clans
on
a
single
island
,
but
over
all
the
inhabitants
of
an
*NL*
entire
group
.
In
illustration
of
this
latter
peculiarity
,
I
may
cite
*NL*
the
law
which
forbids
a
female
to
enter
a
canoe
--
a
prohibition
which
*NL*
prevails
upon
all
the
northern
Marquesas
Islands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
itself
-LRB-
taboo
-RRB-
is
used
in
more
than
one
signification
.
It
*NL*
is
sometimes
used
by
a
parent
to
his
child
,
when
in
the
exercise
*NL*
of
parental
authority
he
forbids
it
to
perform
a
particular
action
.
*NL*
Anything
opposed
to
the
ordinary
customs
of
the
islanders
,
although
not
*NL*
expressly
prohibited
,
is
said
to
be
`
taboo
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Typee
language
is
one
very
difficult
to
be
acquired
;
it
bears
a
*NL*
close
resemblance
to
the
other
Polynesian
dialects
,
all
of
which
show
a
*NL*
common
origin
.
The
duplication
of
words
,
as
`
lumee
lumee
'
,
`
poee
poee
'
,
*NL*
`
muee
muee
'
,
is
one
of
their
peculiar
features
.
But
another
,
and
a
more
*NL*
annoying
one
,
is
the
different
senses
in
which
one
and
the
same
word
is
*NL*
employed
;
its
various
meanings
all
have
a
certain
connection
,
which
*NL*
only
makes
the
matter
more
puzzling
.
So
one
brisk
,
lively
little
word
*NL*
is
obliged
,
like
a
servant
in
a
poor
family
,
to
perform
all
sorts
of
*NL*
duties
;
for
instance
,
one
particular
combination
of
syllables
expresses
*NL*
the
ideas
of
sleep
,
rest
,
reclining
,
sitting
,
leaning
,
and
all
other
*NL*
things
anywise
analogous
thereto
,
the
particular
meaning
being
shown
*NL*
chiefly
by
a
variety
of
gestures
and
the
eloquent
expression
of
the
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
intricacy
of
these
dialects
is
another
peculiarity
.
In
the
*NL*
Missionary
College
at
Lahainaluna
,
on
Mowee
,
one
of
the
Sandwich
*NL*
Islands
,
I
saw
a
tabular
exhibition
of
a
Hawiian
verb
,
conjugated
*NL*
through
all
its
moods
and
tenses
.
It
covered
the
side
of
a
considerable
*NL*
apartment
,
and
I
doubt
whether
Sir
William
Jones
himself
would
not
have
*NL*
despaired
of
mastering
it
.

*NL*
SADLY
discursive
as
I
have
already
been
,
I
must
still
further
entreat
*NL*
the
reader
's
patience
,
as
I
am
about
to
string
together
,
without
any
*NL*
attempt
at
order
,
a
few
odds
and
ends
of
things
not
hitherto
mentioned
,
*NL*
but
which
are
either
curious
in
themselves
or
peculiar
to
the
Typees
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
singular
custom
observed
in
old
Marheyo
's
domestic
*NL*
establishment
,
which
often
excited
my
surprise
.
Every
night
,
before
*NL*
retiring
,
the
inmates
of
the
house
gathered
together
on
the
mats
,
and
*NL*
so
squatting
upon
their
haunches
,
after
the
universal
practice
of
*NL*
these
islanders
,
would
commence
a
low
,
dismal
and
monotonous
chant
,
*NL*
accompanying
the
voice
with
the
instrumental
melody
produced
by
two
*NL*
small
half-rotten
sticks
tapped
slowly
together
,
a
pair
of
which
*NL*
were
held
in
the
hands
of
each
person
present
.
Thus
would
they
employ
*NL*
themselves
for
an
hour
or
two
,
sometimes
longer
.
Lying
in
the
gloom
*NL*
which
wrapped
the
further
end
of
the
house
,
I
could
not
avoid
looking
*NL*
at
them
,
although
the
spectacle
suggested
nothing
but
unpleasant
*NL*
reflection
.
The
flickering
rays
of
the
`
armor
'
nut
just
served
to
reveal
*NL*
their
savage
lineaments
,
without
dispelling
the
darkness
that
hovered
*NL*
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
when
,
after
falling
into
a
kind
of
doze
,
and
awaking
suddenly
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
these
doleful
chantings
,
my
eye
would
fall
upon
the
*NL*
wild-looking
group
engaged
in
their
strange
occupation
,
with
their
naked
*NL*
tattooed
limbs
,
and
shaven
heads
disposed
in
a
circle
,
I
was
almost
*NL*
tempted
to
believe
that
I
gazed
upon
a
set
of
evil
beings
in
the
act
of
*NL*
working
at
a
frightful
incantation
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
the
meaning
or
purpose
of
this
custom
,
whether
it
was
practiced
*NL*
merely
as
a
diversion
,
or
whether
it
was
a
religious
exercise
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
family
prayers
,
I
never
could
discover
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sounds
produced
by
the
natives
on
these
occasions
were
of
a
most
*NL*
singular
description
;
and
had
I
not
actually
been
present
,
I
never
would
*NL*
have
believed
that
such
curious
noises
could
have
been
produced
by
human
*NL*
beings
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
savages
generally
is
imputed
a
guttural
articulation
.
This
however
,
*NL*
is
not
always
the
case
,
especially
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
*NL*
Polynesian
Archipelago
.
The
labial
melody
with
which
the
Typee
girls
*NL*
carry
on
an
ordinary
conversation
,
giving
a
musical
prolongation
to
the
*NL*
final
syllable
of
every
sentence
,
and
chirping
out
some
of
the
words
*NL*
with
a
liquid
,
bird-like
accent
,
was
singularly
pleasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
however
,
are
not
quite
so
harmonious
in
their
utterance
,
and
*NL*
when
excited
upon
any
subject
,
would
work
themselves
up
into
a
sort
of
*NL*
wordy
paroxysm
,
during
which
all
descriptions
of
rough-sided
sounds
*NL*
were
projected
from
their
mouths
,
with
a
force
and
rapidity
which
was
*NL*
absolutely
astonishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
these
savages
are
remarkably
fond
of
chanting
,
still
they
*NL*
appear
to
have
no
idea
whatever
of
singing
,
at
least
as
the
art
is
*NL*
practised
in
other
nations
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
never
forget
the
first
time
I
happened
to
roar
out
a
stave
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
noble
Mehevi
.
It
was
a
stanza
from
the
`
Bavarian
*NL*
broom-seller
'
.
His
Typeean
majesty
,
with
all
his
court
,
gazed
upon
me
in
*NL*
amazement
,
as
if
I
had
displayed
some
preternatural
faculty
which
Heaven
*NL*
had
denied
to
them
.
The
King
was
delighted
with
the
verse
;
but
the
*NL*
chorus
fairly
transported
him
.
At
his
solicitation
I
sang
it
again
and
*NL*
again
,
and
nothing
could
be
more
ludicrous
than
his
vain
attempts
to
*NL*
catch
the
air
and
the
words
.
The
royal
savage
seemed
to
think
that
by
*NL*
screwing
all
the
features
of
his
face
into
the
end
of
his
nose
he
*NL*
might
possibly
succeed
in
the
undertaking
,
but
it
failed
to
answer
the
*NL*
purpose
;
and
in
the
end
he
gave
it
up
,
and
consoled
himself
by
listening
*NL*
to
my
repetition
of
the
sounds
fifty
times
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Previous
to
Mehevi
's
making
the
discovery
,
I
had
never
been
aware
that
*NL*
there
was
anything
of
the
nightingale
about
me
;
but
I
was
now
promoted
*NL*
to
the
place
of
court-minstrel
,
in
which
capacity
I
was
afterwards
*NL*
perpetually
called
upon
to
officiate
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
sticks
and
the
drums
,
there
are
no
other
musical
instruments
*NL*
among
the
Typees
,
except
one
which
might
appropriately
be
denominated
a
*NL*
nasal
flute
.
It
is
somewhat
longer
than
an
ordinary
fife
;
is
made
of
*NL*
a
beautiful
scarlet-coloured
reed
;
and
has
four
or
five
stops
,
with
*NL*
a
large
hole
near
one
end
,
which
latter
is
held
just
beneath
the
left
*NL*
nostril
.
The
other
nostril
being
closed
by
a
peculiar
movement
of
the
*NL*
muscles
about
the
nose
,
the
breath
is
forced
into
the
tube
,
and
produces
*NL*
a
soft
dulcet
sound
which
is
varied
by
the
fingers
running
at
random
*NL*
over
the
stops
.
This
is
a
favourite
recreation
with
the
females
and
one
*NL*
in
which
Fayaway
greatly
excelled
.
Awkward
as
such
an
instrument
may
*NL*
appear
,
it
was
,
in
Fayaway
's
delicate
little
hands
,
one
of
the
most
*NL*
graceful
I
have
ever
seen
.
A
young
lady
,
in
the
act
of
tormenting
a
*NL*
guitar
strung
about
her
neck
by
a
couple
of
yards
of
blue
ribbon
,
is
not
*NL*
half
so
engaging
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Singing
was
not
the
only
means
I
possessed
of
diverting
the
royal
Mehevi
*NL*
and
his
easy-going
subject
.
Nothing
afforded
them
more
pleasure
than
to
*NL*
see
me
go
through
the
attitude
of
pugilistic
encounter
.
As
not
one
of
*NL*
the
natives
had
soul
enough
in
him
to
stand
up
like
a
man
,
and
allow
me
*NL*
to
hammer
away
at
him
,
for
my
own
personal
gratification
and
that
of
*NL*
the
king
,
I
was
necessitated
to
fight
with
an
imaginary
enemy
,
whom
I
*NL*
invariably
made
to
knock
under
to
my
superior
prowess
.
Sometimes
when
*NL*
this
sorely
battered
shadow
retreated
precipitately
towards
a
group
of
*NL*
the
savages
,
and
,
following
him
up
,
I
rushed
among
them
dealing
my
*NL*
blows
right
and
left
,
they
would
disperse
in
all
directions
much
to
the
*NL*
enjoyment
of
Mehevi
,
the
chiefs
,
and
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noble
art
of
self-defence
appeared
to
be
regarded
by
them
as
the
*NL*
peculiar
gift
of
the
white
man
;
and
I
make
little
doubt
that
they
*NL*
supposed
armies
of
Europeans
were
drawn
up
provided
with
nothing
else
*NL*
but
bony
fists
and
stout
hearts
,
with
which
they
set
to
in
column
,
and
*NL*
pummelled
one
another
at
the
word
of
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
in
company
with
Kory-Kory
,
I
had
repaired
to
the
stream
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
bathing
,
when
I
observed
a
woman
sitting
upon
a
rock
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
the
current
,
and
watching
with
the
liveliest
interest
the
*NL*
gambols
of
something
,
which
at
first
I
took
to
be
an
uncommonly
large
*NL*
species
of
frog
that
was
sporting
in
the
water
near
her
.
Attracted
by
*NL*
the
novelty
of
the
sight
,
I
waded
towards
the
spot
where
she
sat
,
and
*NL*
could
hardly
credit
the
evidence
of
my
senses
when
I
beheld
a
little
*NL*
infant
,
the
period
of
whose
birth
could
not
have
extended
back
many
*NL*
days
,
paddling
about
as
if
it
had
just
risen
to
the
surface
,
after
being
*NL*
hatched
into
existence
at
the
bottom
.
Occasionally
,
the
delighted
parent
*NL*
reached
out
her
hand
towards
it
,
when
the
little
thing
,
uttering
a
faint
*NL*
cry
,
and
striking
out
its
tiny
limbs
,
would
sidle
for
the
rock
,
and
the
*NL*
next
moment
be
clasped
to
its
mother
's
bosom
.
This
was
repeated
again
*NL*
and
again
,
the
baby
remaining
in
the
stream
about
a
minute
at
a
time
.
*NL*
Once
or
twice
it
made
wry
faces
at
swallowing
a
mouthful
of
water
,
and
*NL*
choked
a
spluttered
as
if
on
the
point
of
strangling
.
At
such
times
*NL*
however
,
the
mother
snatched
it
up
and
by
a
process
scarcely
to
be
*NL*
mentioned
obliged
it
to
eject
the
fluid
.
For
several
weeks
afterwards
*NL*
I
observed
this
woman
bringing
her
child
down
to
the
stream
regularly
*NL*
every
day
,
in
the
cool
of
the
morning
and
evening
and
treating
it
to
a
*NL*
bath
.
No
wonder
that
the
South
Sea
Islanders
are
so
amphibious
a
race
,
*NL*
when
they
are
thus
launched
into
the
water
as
soon
as
they
see
the
*NL*
light
.
I
am
convinced
that
it
is
as
natural
for
a
human
being
to
swim
as
*NL*
it
is
for
a
duck
.
And
yet
in
civilized
communities
how
many
able-bodied
*NL*
individuals
die
,
like
so
many
drowning
kittens
,
from
the
occurrence
of
*NL*
the
most
trivial
accidents
!
*NL*
*NL*
...
.
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
long
luxuriant
and
glossy
tresses
of
the
Typee
damsels
often
*NL*
attracted
my
admiration
.
A
fine
head
of
hair
is
the
pride
and
joy
of
*NL*
every
woman
's
heart
.
Whether
against
the
express
will
of
Providence
,
it
*NL*
is
twisted
upon
the
crown
of
the
head
and
there
coiled
away
like
a
rope
*NL*
on
a
ship
's
deck
;
whether
it
be
stuck
behind
the
ears
and
hangs
down
*NL*
like
the
swag
of
a
small
window-curtain
;
or
whether
it
be
permitted
to
*NL*
flow
over
the
shoulders
in
natural
ringlets
,
it
is
always
the
pride
of
*NL*
the
owner
,
and
the
glory
of
the
toilette
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Typee
girls
devote
much
of
their
time
to
the
dressing
of
their
fair
*NL*
and
redundant
locks
.
After
bathing
,
as
they
sometimes
do
five
or
six
*NL*
times
every
day
,
the
hair
is
carefully
dried
,
and
if
they
have
been
in
*NL*
the
sea
,
invariably
washed
in
fresh
water
,
and
anointed
with
a
highly
*NL*
scented
oil
extracted
from
the
meat
of
the
cocoanut
.
This
oil
is
*NL*
obtained
in
great
abundance
by
the
following
very
simple
process
:
*NL*
*NL*
A
large
vessel
of
wood
,
with
holes
perforated
in
the
bottom
,
is
filled
*NL*
with
the
pounded
meat
,
and
exposed
to
the
rays
of
the
sun
.
As
the
*NL*
oleaginous
matter
exudes
,
it
falls
in
drops
through
the
apertures
into
a
*NL*
wide-mouthed
calabash
placed
underneath
.
After
a
sufficient
quantity
has
*NL*
thus
been
collected
,
the
oil
undergoes
a
purifying
process
,
and
is
then
*NL*
poured
into
the
small
spherical
shells
of
the
nuts
of
the
moo-tree
,
*NL*
which
are
hollowed
out
to
receive
it
.
These
nuts
are
then
hermetically
*NL*
sealed
with
a
resinous
gum
,
and
the
vegetable
fragrance
of
their
green
*NL*
rind
soon
imparts
to
the
oil
a
delightful
odour
.
After
the
lapse
of
a
*NL*
few
weeks
the
exterior
shell
of
the
nuts
becomes
quite
dry
and
hard
,
and
*NL*
assumes
a
beautiful
carnation
tint
;
and
when
opened
they
are
found
to
*NL*
be
about
two-thirds
full
of
an
ointment
of
a
light
yellow
colour
and
*NL*
diffusing
the
sweetest
perfume
.
This
elegant
little
odorous
globe
would
*NL*
not
be
out
of
place
even
upon
the
toilette
of
a
queen
.
Its
merits
as
a
*NL*
preparation
for
the
hair
are
undeniable
--
it
imparts
to
it
a
superb
gloss
*NL*
and
a
silky
fineness
.

SUBSEQUENT
DISCLOSURES
*NL*
*NL*
FROM
the
time
of
my
casual
encounter
with
Karky
the
artist
,
my
life
was
*NL*
one
of
absolute
wretchedness
.
Not
a
day
passed
but
I
was
persecuted
by
*NL*
the
solicitations
of
some
of
the
natives
to
subject
myself
to
the
odious
*NL*
operation
of
tattooing
.
Their
importunities
drove
me
half
wild
,
for
I
*NL*
felt
how
easily
they
might
work
their
will
upon
me
regarding
this
or
*NL*
anything
else
which
they
took
into
their
heads
.
Still
,
however
,
the
*NL*
behaviour
of
the
islanders
towards
me
was
as
kind
as
ever
.
Fayaway
was
*NL*
quite
as
engaging
;
Kory-Kory
as
devoted
;
and
Mehevi
the
king
just
as
*NL*
gracious
and
condescending
as
before
.
But
I
had
now
been
three
months
in
*NL*
their
valley
,
as
nearly
as
I
could
estimate
;
I
had
grown
familiar
with
*NL*
the
narrow
limits
to
which
my
wandering
had
been
confined
;
and
I
began
*NL*
bitterly
to
feel
the
state
of
captivity
in
which
I
was
held
.
There
*NL*
was
no
one
with
whom
I
could
freely
converse
;
no
one
to
whom
I
could
*NL*
communicate
my
thoughts
;
no
one
who
could
sympathize
with
my
sufferings
.
*NL*
A
thousand
times
I
thought
how
much
more
endurable
would
have
been
my
*NL*
lot
had
Toby
still
been
with
me
.
But
I
was
left
alone
,
and
the
thought
*NL*
was
terrible
to
me
.
Still
,
despite
my
griefs
,
I
did
all
in
my
power
*NL*
to
appear
composed
and
cheerful
,
well
knowing
that
by
manifesting
any
*NL*
uneasiness
,
or
any
desire
to
escape
,
I
should
only
frustrate
my
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
during
the
period
I
was
in
this
unhappy
frame
of
mind
that
the
*NL*
painful
malady
under
which
I
had
been
labouring
--
after
having
almost
*NL*
completely
subsided
--
began
again
to
show
itself
,
and
with
symptoms
as
*NL*
violent
as
ever
.
This
added
calamity
nearly
unmanned
me
;
the
recurrence
*NL*
of
the
complaint
proved
that
without
powerful
remedial
applications
*NL*
all
hope
of
cure
was
futile
;
and
when
I
reflected
that
just
beyond
the
*NL*
elevations
,
which
bound
me
in
,
was
the
medical
relief
I
needed
,
and
that
*NL*
although
so
near
,
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
avail
myself
of
it
,
the
*NL*
thought
was
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
wretched
situation
,
every
circumstance
which
evinced
the
*NL*
savage
nature
of
the
beings
at
whose
mercy
I
was
,
augmented
the
fearful
*NL*
apprehensions
that
consumed
me
.
An
occurrence
which
happened
about
this
*NL*
time
affected
me
most
powerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
already
mentioned
that
from
the
ridge-pole
of
Marheyo
's
house
*NL*
were
suspended
a
number
of
packages
enveloped
in
tappa
.
Many
of
these
I
*NL*
had
often
seen
in
the
hands
of
the
natives
,
and
their
contents
had
been
*NL*
examined
in
my
presence
.
But
there
were
three
packages
hanging
*NL*
very
nearly
over
the
place
where
I
lay
,
which
from
their
remarkable
*NL*
appearance
had
often
excited
my
curiosity
.
Several
times
I
had
asked
*NL*
Kory-Kory
to
show
me
their
contents
,
but
my
servitor
,
who
,
in
almost
*NL*
every
other
particular
had
acceded
to
my
wishes
,
refused
to
gratify
me
*NL*
in
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
returning
unexpectedly
from
the
`
Ti
'
,
my
arrival
seemed
to
*NL*
throw
the
inmates
of
the
house
into
the
greatest
confusion
.
They
were
*NL*
seated
together
on
the
mats
,
and
by
the
lines
which
extended
from
the
*NL*
roof
to
the
floor
I
immediately
perceived
that
the
mysterious
packages
*NL*
were
for
some
purpose
or
another
under
inspection
.
The
evident
alarm
*NL*
the
savages
betrayed
filled
me
with
forebodings
of
evil
,
and
with
an
*NL*
uncontrollable
desire
to
penetrate
the
secret
so
jealously
guarded
.
*NL*
Despite
the
efforts
of
Marheyo
and
Kory-Kory
to
restrain
me
,
I
forced
*NL*
my
way
into
the
midst
of
the
circle
,
and
just
caught
a
glimpse
of
three
*NL*
human
heads
,
which
others
of
the
party
were
hurriedly
enveloping
in
the
*NL*
coverings
from
which
they
had
been
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
three
I
distinctly
saw
.
It
was
in
a
state
of
perfect
*NL*
preservation
,
and
from
the
slight
glimpse
I
had
of
it
,
seemed
to
have
*NL*
been
subjected
to
some
smoking
operation
which
had
reduced
it
to
the
*NL*
dry
,
hard
,
and
mummy-like
appearance
it
presented
.
The
two
long
scalp
*NL*
locks
were
twisted
up
into
balls
upon
the
crown
of
the
head
in
the
same
*NL*
way
that
the
individual
had
worn
them
during
life
.
The
sunken
cheeks
*NL*
were
rendered
yet
more
ghastly
by
the
rows
of
glistening
teeth
which
*NL*
protruded
from
between
the
lips
,
while
the
sockets
of
the
eyes
--
filled
*NL*
with
oval
bits
of
mother-of-pearl
shell
,
with
a
black
spot
in
the
*NL*
centre
--
heightened
the
hideousness
of
its
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
of
the
three
were
heads
of
the
islanders
;
but
the
third
,
to
my
*NL*
horror
,
was
that
of
a
white
man
.
Although
it
had
been
quickly
removed
*NL*
from
my
sight
,
still
the
glimpse
I
had
of
it
was
enough
to
convince
me
*NL*
that
I
could
not
be
mistaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gracious
God
!
what
dreadful
thoughts
entered
my
head
;
in
solving
this
*NL*
mystery
perhaps
I
had
solved
another
,
and
the
fate
of
my
lost
companion
*NL*
might
be
revealed
in
the
shocking
spectacle
I
had
just
witnessed
.
I
*NL*
longed
to
have
torn
off
the
folds
of
cloth
and
satisfied
the
awful
*NL*
doubts
under
which
I
laboured
.
But
before
I
had
recovered
from
the
*NL*
consternation
into
which
I
had
been
thrown
,
the
fatal
packages
were
*NL*
hoisted
aloft
,
and
once
more
swung
over
my
head
.
The
natives
now
*NL*
gathered
round
me
tumultuously
,
and
laboured
to
convince
me
that
what
*NL*
I
had
just
seen
were
the
heads
of
three
Happar
warriors
,
who
had
been
*NL*
slain
in
battle
.
This
glaring
falsehood
added
to
my
alarm
,
and
it
was
*NL*
not
until
I
reflected
that
I
had
observed
the
packages
swinging
from
*NL*
their
elevation
before
Toby
's
disappearance
,
that
I
could
at
all
recover
*NL*
my
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
although
this
horrible
apprehension
had
been
dispelled
,
I
had
*NL*
discovered
enough
to
fill
me
,
in
my
present
state
of
mind
,
with
the
most
*NL*
bitter
reflections
.
It
was
plain
that
I
had
seen
the
last
relic
of
some
*NL*
unfortunate
wretch
,
who
must
have
been
massacred
on
the
beach
by
the
*NL*
savages
,
in
one
of
those
perilous
trading
adventures
which
I
have
before
*NL*
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
,
however
,
alone
the
murder
of
the
stranger
that
overcame
me
*NL*
with
gloom
.
I
shuddered
at
the
idea
of
the
subsequent
fate
his
inanimate
*NL*
body
might
have
met
with
.
Was
the
same
doom
reserved
for
me
?
Was
I
*NL*
destined
to
perish
like
him
--
like
him
perhaps
,
to
be
devoured
and
my
*NL*
head
to
be
preserved
as
a
fearful
memento
of
the
events
?
My
imagination
*NL*
ran
riot
in
these
horrid
speculations
,
and
I
felt
certain
that
the
*NL*
worst
possible
evils
would
befall
me
.
But
whatever
were
my
misgivings
,
I
*NL*
studiously
concealed
them
from
the
islanders
,
as
well
as
the
full
extent
*NL*
of
the
discovery
I
had
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
the
assurances
which
the
Typees
had
often
given
me
,
that
they
*NL*
never
eat
human
flesh
,
had
not
convinced
me
that
such
was
the
case
,
yet
,
*NL*
having
been
so
long
a
time
in
the
valley
without
witnessing
anything
*NL*
which
indicated
the
existence
of
the
practice
,
I
began
to
hope
that
it
*NL*
was
an
event
of
very
rare
occurrence
,
and
that
I
should
be
spared
the
*NL*
horror
of
witnessing
it
during
my
stay
among
them
:
but
,
alas
,
these
*NL*
hopes
were
soon
destroyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
singular
fact
,
that
in
all
our
accounts
of
cannibal
tribes
we
*NL*
have
seldom
received
the
testimony
of
an
eye-witness
account
to
this
*NL*
revolting
practice
.
The
horrible
conclusion
has
almost
always
been
*NL*
derived
from
the
second-hand
evidence
of
Europeans
,
or
else
from
the
*NL*
admissions
of
the
savages
themselves
,
after
they
have
in
some
degree
*NL*
become
civilized
.
The
Polynesians
are
aware
of
the
detestation
in
which
*NL*
Europeans
hold
this
custom
,
and
therefore
invariably
deny
its
existence
,
*NL*
and
with
the
craft
peculiar
to
savages
,
endeavour
to
conceal
every
trace
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
excessive
unwillingness
betrayed
by
the
Sandwich
Islanders
,
even
at
*NL*
the
present
day
,
to
allude
to
the
unhappy
fate
of
Cook
,
has
often
been
*NL*
remarked
.
And
so
well
have
they
succeeded
in
covering
the
event
with
*NL*
mystery
,
that
to
this
very
hour
,
despite
all
that
has
been
said
and
*NL*
written
on
the
subject
,
it
still
remains
doubtful
whether
they
wreaked
*NL*
upon
his
murdered
body
the
vengeance
they
sometimes
inflicted
upon
their
*NL*
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Kealakekau
,
the
scene
of
that
tragedy
,
a
strip
of
ship
's
copper
*NL*
nailed
against
an
upright
post
in
the
ground
used
to
inform
*NL*
the
traveller
that
beneath
reposed
the
`
remains
'
of
the
great
*NL*
circumnavigator
.
But
I
am
strongly
inclined
to
believe
not
only
the
*NL*
corpse
was
refused
Christian
burial
,
but
that
the
heart
which
was
*NL*
brought
to
Vancouver
some
time
after
the
event
,
and
which
the
Hawaiians
*NL*
stoutly
maintained
was
that
of
Captain
Cook
,
was
no
such
thing
;
and
that
*NL*
the
whole
affair
was
a
piece
of
imposture
which
was
sought
to
be
palmed
*NL*
off
upon
the
credulous
Englishman
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
years
since
there
was
living
on
the
island
of
Maui
-LRB-
one
of
the
*NL*
Sandwich
group
-RRB-
an
old
chief
,
who
,
actuated
by
a
morbid
desire
for
*NL*
notoriety
,
gave
himself
out
among
the
foreign
residents
of
the
place
*NL*
as
the
living
tomb
of
Captain
Cook
's
big
toe
!
--
affirming
that
at
the
*NL*
cannibal
entertainment
which
ensued
after
the
lamented
Briton
's
death
,
*NL*
that
particular
portion
of
his
body
had
fallen
to
his
share
.
His
*NL*
indignant
countrymen
actually
caused
him
to
be
prosecuted
in
the
native
*NL*
courts
,
on
a
charge
nearly
equivalent
to
what
we
term
defamation
of
*NL*
character
;
but
the
old
fellow
persisting
in
his
assertion
,
and
no
*NL*
invalidating
proof
being
adduced
,
the
plaintiffs
were
cast
in
the
suit
,
*NL*
and
the
cannibal
reputation
of
the
defendant
firmly
established
.
This
*NL*
result
was
the
making
of
his
fortune
;
ever
afterwards
he
was
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
giving
very
profitable
audiences
to
all
curious
travellers
who
*NL*
were
desirous
of
beholding
the
man
who
had
eaten
the
great
navigator
's
*NL*
great
toe
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
week
after
my
discovery
of
the
contents
of
the
mysterious
*NL*
packages
,
I
happened
to
be
at
the
Ti
,
when
another
war-alarm
was
*NL*
sounded
,
and
the
natives
rushing
to
their
arms
,
sallied
out
to
resist
*NL*
a
second
incursion
of
the
Happar
invaders
.
The
same
scene
was
again
*NL*
repeated
,
only
that
on
this
occasion
I
heard
at
least
fifteen
reports
of
*NL*
muskets
from
the
mountains
during
the
time
that
the
skirmish
lasted
.
*NL*
An
hour
or
two
after
its
termination
,
loud
paeans
chanted
through
the
*NL*
valley
announced
the
approach
of
the
victors
.
I
stood
with
Kory-Kory
*NL*
leaning
against
the
railing
of
the
pi-pi
awaiting
their
advance
,
when
*NL*
a
tumultuous
crowd
of
islanders
emerged
with
wild
clamours
from
*NL*
the
neighbouring
groves
.
In
the
midst
of
them
marched
four
men
,
one
*NL*
preceding
the
other
at
regular
intervals
of
eight
or
ten
feet
,
with
*NL*
poles
of
a
corresponding
length
,
extending
from
shoulder
to
shoulder
,
*NL*
to
which
were
lashed
with
thongs
of
bark
three
long
narrow
bundles
,
*NL*
carefully
wrapped
in
ample
coverings
of
freshly
plucked
palm-leaves
,
*NL*
tacked
together
with
slivers
of
bamboo
.
Here
and
there
upon
these
green
*NL*
winding-sheets
might
be
seen
the
stains
of
blood
,
while
the
warriors
who
*NL*
carried
the
frightful
burdens
displayed
upon
their
naked
limbs
similar
*NL*
sanguinary
marks
.
The
shaven
head
of
the
foremost
had
a
deep
gash
upon
*NL*
it
,
and
the
clotted
gore
which
had
flowed
from
the
wound
remained
in
dry
*NL*
patches
around
it
.
The
savage
seemed
to
be
sinking
under
the
weight
*NL*
he
bore
.
The
bright
tattooing
upon
his
body
was
covered
with
blood
*NL*
and
dust
;
his
inflamed
eyes
rolled
in
their
sockets
,
and
his
whole
*NL*
appearance
denoted
extraordinary
suffering
and
exertion
;
yet
sustained
*NL*
by
some
powerful
impulse
,
he
continued
to
advance
,
while
the
throng
*NL*
around
him
with
wild
cheers
sought
to
encourage
him
.
The
other
three
men
*NL*
were
marked
about
the
arms
and
breasts
with
several
slight
wounds
,
which
*NL*
they
somewhat
ostentatiously
displayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
four
individuals
,
having
been
the
most
active
in
the
late
*NL*
encounter
,
claimed
the
honour
of
bearing
the
bodies
of
their
slain
*NL*
enemies
to
the
Ti
.
Such
was
the
conclusion
I
drew
from
my
own
*NL*
observations
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
could
understand
,
from
the
explanation
*NL*
which
Kory-Kory
gave
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
royal
Mehevi
walked
by
the
side
of
these
heroes
.
He
carried
in
one
*NL*
hand
a
musket
,
from
the
barrel
of
which
was
suspended
a
small
canvas
*NL*
pouch
of
powder
,
and
in
the
other
he
grasped
a
short
javelin
,
which
he
*NL*
held
before
him
and
regarded
with
fierce
exultation
.
This
javelin
he
had
*NL*
wrested
from
a
celebrated
champion
of
the
Happars
,
who
had
ignominiously
*NL*
fled
,
and
was
pursued
by
his
foes
beyond
the
summit
of
the
mountain
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
within
a
short
distance
of
the
Ti
,
the
warrior
with
the
wounded
*NL*
head
,
who
proved
to
be
Narmonee
,
tottered
forward
two
or
three
steps
,
*NL*
and
fell
helplessly
to
the
ground
;
but
not
before
another
had
caught
the
*NL*
end
of
the
pole
from
his
shoulder
,
and
placed
it
upon
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
excited
throng
of
islanders
,
who
surrounded
the
person
of
the
king
*NL*
and
the
dead
bodies
of
the
enemy
,
approached
the
spot
where
I
stood
,
*NL*
brandishing
their
rude
implements
of
warfare
,
many
of
which
were
bruised
*NL*
and
broken
,
and
uttering
continual
shouts
of
triumph
.
When
the
crowd
*NL*
drew
up
opposite
the
Ti
,
I
set
myself
to
watch
their
proceedings
most
*NL*
attentively
;
but
scarcely
had
they
halted
when
my
servitor
,
who
had
left
*NL*
my
side
for
an
instant
,
touched
my
arm
and
proposed
our
returning
to
*NL*
Marheyo
's
house
.
To
this
I
objected
;
but
,
to
my
surprise
,
Kory-Kory
*NL*
reiterated
his
request
,
and
with
an
unusual
vehemence
of
manner
.
Still
,
*NL*
however
,
I
refused
to
comply
,
and
was
retreating
before
him
,
as
in
his
*NL*
importunity
he
pressed
upon
me
,
when
I
felt
a
heavy
hand
laid
upon
my
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
turning
round
,
encountered
the
bulky
form
of
Mow-Mow
,
a
*NL*
one-eyed
chief
,
who
had
just
detached
himself
from
the
crowd
below
,
and
*NL*
had
mounted
the
rear
of
the
pi-pi
upon
which
we
stood
.
His
cheek
had
*NL*
been
pierced
by
the
point
of
a
spear
,
and
the
wound
imparted
a
still
*NL*
more
frightful
expression
to
his
hideously
tattooed
face
,
already
*NL*
deformed
by
the
loss
of
an
eye
.
The
warrior
,
without
uttering
a
*NL*
syllable
,
pointed
fiercely
in
the
direction
of
Marheyo
's
house
,
while
*NL*
Kory-Kory
,
at
the
same
time
presenting
his
back
,
desired
me
to
mount
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
declined
this
offer
,
but
intimated
my
willingness
to
withdraw
,
and
*NL*
moved
slowly
along
the
piazza
,
wondering
what
could
be
the
cause
of
this
*NL*
unusual
treatment
.
A
few
minutes
'
consideration
convinced
me
that
the
*NL*
savages
were
about
to
celebrate
some
hideous
rite
in
connection
with
*NL*
their
peculiar
customs
,
and
at
which
they
were
determined
I
should
not
*NL*
be
present
.
I
descended
from
the
pi-pi
,
and
attended
by
Kory-Kory
,
who
*NL*
on
this
occasion
did
not
show
his
usual
commiseration
for
my
lameness
,
*NL*
but
seemed
only
anxious
to
hurry
me
on
,
walked
away
from
the
place
.
As
I
*NL*
passed
through
the
noisy
throng
,
which
by
this
time
completely
environed
*NL*
the
Ti
,
I
looked
with
fearful
curiosity
at
the
three
packages
,
which
now
*NL*
were
deposited
upon
the
ground
;
but
although
I
had
no
doubt
as
to
their
*NL*
contents
,
still
their
thick
coverings
prevented
my
actually
detecting
*NL*
the
form
of
a
human
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
shortly
after
sunrise
,
the
same
thundering
sounds
*NL*
which
had
awakened
me
from
sleep
on
the
second
day
of
the
Feast
of
*NL*
Calabashes
,
assured
me
that
the
savages
were
on
the
eve
of
celebrating
*NL*
another
,
and
,
as
I
fully
believed
,
a
horrible
solemnity
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
inmates
of
the
house
,
with
the
exception
of
Marheyo
,
his
son
,
*NL*
and
Tinor
,
after
assuming
their
gala
dresses
,
departed
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
the
Taboo
Groves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
I
did
not
anticipate
a
compliance
with
my
request
,
still
,
with
*NL*
a
view
of
testing
the
truth
of
my
suspicions
,
I
proposed
to
Kory-Kory
*NL*
that
,
according
to
our
usual
custom
in
the
morning
,
we
should
take
a
*NL*
stroll
to
the
Ti
:
he
positively
refused
;
and
when
I
renewed
the
request
,
*NL*
he
evinced
his
determination
to
prevent
my
going
there
;
and
,
to
divert
*NL*
my
mind
from
the
subject
,
he
offered
to
accompany
me
to
the
stream
.
We
*NL*
accordingly
went
,
and
bathed
.
On
our
coming
back
to
the
house
,
I
was
*NL*
surprised
to
find
that
all
its
inmates
had
returned
,
and
were
lounging
*NL*
upon
the
mats
as
usual
,
although
the
drums
still
sounded
from
the
*NL*
groves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
day
I
spent
with
Kory-Kory
and
Fayaway
,
wandering
about
*NL*
a
part
of
the
valley
situated
in
an
opposite
direction
from
the
Ti
,
*NL*
and
whenever
I
so
much
as
looked
towards
that
building
,
although
it
was
*NL*
hidden
from
view
by
intervening
trees
,
and
at
the
distance
of
more
than
*NL*
a
mile
,
my
attendant
would
exclaim
,
`
Taboo
,
taboo
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
various
houses
where
we
stopped
,
I
found
many
of
the
inhabitants
*NL*
reclining
at
their
ease
,
or
pursuing
some
light
occupation
,
as
if
*NL*
nothing
unusual
were
going
forward
;
but
amongst
them
all
I
did
not
*NL*
perceive
a
single
chief
or
warrior
.
When
I
asked
several
of
the
people
*NL*
why
they
were
not
at
the
`
Hoolah
Hoolah
'
-LRB-
the
feast
-RRB-
,
their
uniformly
*NL*
answered
the
question
in
a
manner
which
implied
that
it
was
not
intended
*NL*
for
them
,
but
for
Mehevi
,
Narmonee
,
Mow-Mow
,
Kolor
,
Womonoo
,
Kalow
,
*NL*
running
over
,
in
their
desire
to
make
me
comprehend
their
meaning
,
the
*NL*
names
of
all
the
principal
chiefs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
,
in
short
,
strengthened
my
suspicions
with
regard
to
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
festival
they
were
now
celebrating
;
and
which
amounted
*NL*
almost
to
a
certainty
.
While
in
Nukuheva
I
had
frequently
been
informed
*NL*
that
the
whole
tribe
were
never
present
at
these
cannibal
banquets
,
but
*NL*
the
chiefs
and
priests
only
;
and
everything
I
now
observed
agreed
with
*NL*
the
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
the
drums
continued
without
intermission
the
whole
day
,
and
*NL*
falling
continually
upon
my
ear
,
caused
me
a
sensation
of
horror
which
I
*NL*
am
unable
to
describe
.
On
the
following
day
,
hearing
none
of
those
*NL*
noisy
indications
of
revelry
,
I
concluded
that
the
inhuman
feast
was
*NL*
terminated
;
and
feeling
a
kind
of
morbid
curiosity
to
discover
whether
*NL*
the
Ti
might
furnish
any
evidence
of
what
had
taken
place
there
,
I
*NL*
proposed
to
Kory-Kory
to
walk
there
.
To
this
proposition
he
replied
*NL*
by
pointing
with
his
finger
to
the
newly
risen
sun
,
and
then
up
to
the
*NL*
zenith
,
intimating
that
our
visit
must
be
deferred
until
noon
.
Shortly
*NL*
after
that
hour
we
accordingly
proceeded
to
the
Taboo
Groves
,
and
as
*NL*
soon
as
we
entered
their
precincts
,
I
looked
fearfully
round
in
,
quest
*NL*
of
some
memorial
of
the
scene
which
had
so
lately
been
acted
there
;
but
*NL*
everything
appeared
as
usual
.
On
reaching
the
Ti
,
we
found
Mehevi
and
a
*NL*
few
chiefs
reclining
on
the
mats
,
who
gave
me
as
friendly
a
reception
as
*NL*
ever
.
No
allusions
of
any
kind
were
made
by
them
to
the
recent
events
;
*NL*
and
I
refrained
,
for
obvious
reasons
,
from
referring
to
them
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
staying
a
short
time
I
took
my
leave
.
In
passing
along
the
piazza
,
*NL*
previously
to
descending
from
the
pi-pi
,
I
observed
a
curiously
carved
*NL*
vessel
of
wood
,
of
considerable
size
,
with
a
cover
placed
over
it
,
of
*NL*
the
same
material
,
and
which
resembled
in
shape
a
small
canoe
.
It
was
*NL*
surrounded
by
a
low
railing
of
bamboos
,
the
top
of
which
was
scarcely
*NL*
a
foot
from
the
ground
.
As
the
vessel
had
been
placed
in
its
present
*NL*
position
since
my
last
visit
,
I
at
once
concluded
that
it
must
have
*NL*
some
connection
with
the
recent
festival
,
and
,
prompted
by
a
curiosity
*NL*
I
could
not
repress
,
in
passing
it
I
raised
one
end
of
the
cover
;
at
the
*NL*
same
moment
the
chiefs
,
perceiving
my
design
,
loudly
ejaculated
,
`
Taboo
!
*NL*
taboo
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
slight
glimpse
sufficed
;
my
eyes
fell
upon
the
disordered
*NL*
members
of
a
human
skeleton
,
the
bones
still
fresh
with
moisture
,
and
*NL*
with
particles
of
flesh
clinging
to
them
here
and
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
Kory-Kory
,
who
had
been
a
little
in
advance
of
me
,
attracted
by
*NL*
the
exclamations
of
the
chiefs
,
turned
round
in
time
to
witness
the
*NL*
expression
of
horror
on
my
countenance
.
He
now
hurried
towards
me
,
*NL*
pointing
at
the
same
time
to
the
canoe
,
and
exclaiming
rapidly
,
*NL*
`
Puarkee
!
puarkee
!
'
-LRB-
Pig
,
pig
-RRB-
.
I
pretended
to
yield
to
the
deception
,
*NL*
and
repeated
the
words
after
him
several
times
,
as
though
acquiescing
*NL*
in
what
he
said
.
The
other
savages
,
either
deceived
by
my
conduct
*NL*
or
unwilling
to
manifest
their
displeasure
at
what
could
not
now
be
*NL*
remedied
,
took
no
further
notice
of
the
occurrence
,
and
I
immediately
*NL*
left
the
Ti
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
night
I
lay
awake
,
revolving
in
my
mind
the
fearful
situation
*NL*
in
which
I
was
placed
.
The
last
horrid
revelation
had
now
been
made
,
and
*NL*
the
full
sense
of
my
condition
rushed
upon
my
mind
with
a
force
I
had
*NL*
never
before
experienced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
,
thought
I
,
desponding
,
is
there
the
slightest
prospect
of
escape
?
*NL*
The
only
person
who
seemed
to
possess
the
ability
to
assist
me
was
the
*NL*
stranger
Marnoo
;
but
would
he
ever
return
to
the
valley
?
and
if
he
did
,
*NL*
should
I
be
permitted
to
hold
any
communication
with
him
?
It
seemed
as
*NL*
if
I
were
cut
off
from
every
source
of
hope
,
and
that
nothing
remained
*NL*
but
passively
to
await
whatever
fate
was
in
store
for
me
.
A
thousand
*NL*
times
I
endeavoured
to
account
for
the
mysterious
conduct
of
the
*NL*
natives
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
what
conceivable
purpose
did
they
thus
retain
me
a
captive
?
What
*NL*
could
be
their
object
in
treating
me
with
such
apparent
kindness
,
and
*NL*
did
it
not
cover
some
treacherous
scheme
?
Or
,
if
they
had
no
other
*NL*
design
than
to
hold
me
a
prisoner
,
how
should
I
be
able
to
pass
away
my
*NL*
days
in
this
narrow
valley
,
deprived
of
all
intercourse
with
civilized
*NL*
beings
,
and
for
ever
separated
from
friends
and
home
?
*NL*
*NL*
One
only
hope
remained
to
me
.
The
French
could
not
long
defer
a
visit
*NL*
to
the
bay
,
and
if
they
should
permanently
locate
any
of
their
troops
*NL*
in
the
valley
,
the
savages
could
not
for
any
length
of
time
conceal
my
*NL*
existence
from
them
.
But
what
reason
had
I
to
suppose
that
I
should
be
*NL*
spared
until
such
an
event
occurred
,
an
event
which
might
be
postponed
*NL*
by
a
hundred
different
contingencies
?

'
Such
were
the
welcome
sounds
which
fell
upon
my
*NL*
ear
some
ten
days
after
the
events
related
in
the
preceding
chapter
.
*NL*
Once
more
the
approach
of
the
stranger
was
heralded
,
and
the
*NL*
intelligence
operated
upon
me
like
magic
.
Again
I
should
be
able
to
*NL*
converse
with
him
in
my
own
language
;
and
I
resolve
at
all
hazards
to
*NL*
concert
with
him
some
scheme
,
however
desperate
,
to
rescue
me
from
a
*NL*
condition
that
had
now
become
insupportable
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
drew
near
,
I
remembered
with
many
misgivings
the
inauspicious
*NL*
termination
of
our
former
interview
,
and
when
he
entered
the
house
,
I
*NL*
watched
with
intense
anxiety
the
reception
he
met
with
from
its
inmates
.
*NL*
To
my
joy
,
his
appearance
was
hailed
with
the
liveliest
pleasure
;
and
*NL*
accosting
me
kindly
,
he
seated
himself
by
my
side
,
and
entered
into
*NL*
conversation
with
the
natives
around
him
.
It
soon
appeared
however
,
*NL*
that
on
this
occasion
he
had
not
any
intelligence
of
importance
to
*NL*
communicate
.
I
inquired
of
him
from
whence
he
had
just
come
?
He
replied
*NL*
from
Pueearka
,
his
native
valley
,
and
that
he
intended
to
return
to
it
*NL*
the
same
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
once
it
struck
me
that
,
could
I
but
reach
that
valley
under
his
*NL*
protection
,
I
might
easily
from
thence
reach
Nukuheva
by
water
;
and
*NL*
animated
by
the
prospect
which
this
plan
held
,
out
I
disclosed
it
in
*NL*
a
few
brief
words
to
the
stranger
,
and
asked
him
how
it
could
be
best
*NL*
accomplished
.
My
heart
sunk
within
me
,
when
in
his
broken
English
he
*NL*
answered
me
that
it
could
never
be
effected
.
`
Kanaka
no
let
you
go
*NL*
nowhere
,
'
he
said
;
`
you
taboo
.
Why
you
no
like
to
stay
?
Plenty
moee-moee
*NL*
-LRB-
sleep
-RRB-
--
plenty
ki-ki
-LRB-
eat
-RRB-
--
plenty
wahenee
-LRB-
young

-RRB-
--
Oh
,
very
good
*NL*
place
Typee
!
Suppose
you
no
like
this
bay
,
why
you
come
?
You
no
hear
*NL*
about
Typee
?
All
white
men
afraid
Typee
,
so
no
white
men
come
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
distressed
me
beyond
belief
;
and
when
I
had
again
related
to
*NL*
him
the
circumstances
under
which
I
had
descended
into
the
valley
,
and
*NL*
sought
to
enlist
his
sympathies
in
my
behalf
by
appealing
to
the
bodily
*NL*
misery
I
had
endure
,
he
listened
with
impatience
,
and
cut
me
short
by
*NL*
exclaiming
passionately
,
`
Me
no
hear
you
talk
any
more
;
by
by
Kanaka
*NL*
get
mad
,
kill
you
and
me
too
.
No
you
see
he
no
want
you
to
speak
at
*NL*
all
?
--
you
see
--
ah
!
by
by
you
no
mind
--
you
get
well
,
he
kill
you
,
eat
*NL*
you
,
hang
you
head
up
there
,
like
Happar
Kanaka
.
--
Now
you
listen
--
but
no
*NL*
talk
any
more
.
By
by
I
go
;
--
you
see
way
I
go
--
Ah
!
then
some
night
Kanaka
*NL*
all
moee-moee
-LRB-
sleep
-RRB-
--
you
run
away
,
you
come
Pueearka
.
I
speak
Pueearka
*NL*
Kanaka
--
he
no
harm
you
--
ah
!
then
I
take
you
my
canoe
Nukuheva
--
and
you
*NL*
run
away
ship
no
more
.
'
With
these
words
,
enforced
by
a
vehemence
of
*NL*
gesture
I
can
not
describe
,
Marnoo
started
from
my
side
,
and
immediately
*NL*
engaged
in
conversation
with
some
of
the
chiefs
who
had
entered
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
idle
for
me
to
have
attempted
resuming
the
interview
*NL*
so
peremptorily
terminated
by
Marnoo
,
who
was
evidently
little
disposed
*NL*
to
compromise
his
own
safety
by
any
rash
endeavour
to
ensure
mine
.
*NL*
But
the
plan
he
had
suggested
struck
me
as
one
which
might
possibly
be
*NL*
accomplished
,
and
I
resolved
to
act
upon
it
as
speedily
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
when
he
arose
to
depart
,
I
accompanied
him
with
the
natives
*NL*
outside
of
the
house
,
with
a
view
of
carefully
noting
the
path
he
*NL*
would
take
in
leaving
the
valley
.
Just
before
leaping
from
the
pi-pi
he
*NL*
clasped
my
hand
,
and
looking
significantly
at
me
,
exclaimed
,
`
Now
you
*NL*
see
--
you
do
what
I
tell
you
--
ah
!
then
you
do
good
;
--
you
no
do
so
--
ah
!
*NL*
then
you
die
.
'
The
next
moment
he
waved
his
spear
to
the
islanders
,
and
*NL*
following
the
route
that
conducted
to
a
defile
in
the
mountains
lying
*NL*
opposite
the
Happar
side
,
was
soon
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mode
of
escape
was
now
presented
to
me
,
but
how
was
I
to
avail
myself
*NL*
of
it
?
I
was
continually
surrounded
by
the
savages
;
I
could
not
stir
*NL*
from
one
house
to
another
without
being
attended
by
some
of
them
;
and
*NL*
even
during
the
hours
devoted
to
slumber
,
the
slightest
movement
which
I
*NL*
made
seemed
to
attract
the
notice
of
those
who
shared
the
mats
with
me
.
*NL*
In
spite
of
these
obstacles
,
however
,
I
determined
forthwith
to
make
the
*NL*
attempt
.
To
do
so
with
any
prospect
of
success
,
it
was
necessary
that
*NL*
I
should
have
at
least
two
hours
start
before
the
islanders
should
*NL*
discover
my
absence
;
for
with
such
facility
was
any
alarm
spread
through
*NL*
the
valley
,
and
so
familiar
,
of
course
,
were
the
inhabitants
with
the
*NL*
intricacies
of
the
groves
,
that
I
could
not
hope
,
lame
and
feeble
as
I
*NL*
was
,
and
ignorant
of
the
route
,
to
secure
my
escape
unless
I
had
this
*NL*
advantage
.
It
was
also
by
night
alone
that
I
could
hope
to
accomplish
my
*NL*
object
,
and
then
only
by
adopting
the
utmost
precaution
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
to
Marheyo
's
habitation
was
through
a
low
narrow
opening
*NL*
in
its
wicker-work
front
.
This
passage
,
for
no
conceivable
reason
that
I
*NL*
could
devise
,
was
always
closed
after
the
household
had
retired
to
rest
,
*NL*
by
drawing
a
heavy
slide
across
it
,
composed
of
a
dozen
or
more
bits
of
*NL*
wood
,
ingeniously
fastened
together
by
seizings
of
sinnate
.
When
any
of
*NL*
the
inmates
chose
to
go
outside
,
the
noise
occasioned
by
the
removing
of
*NL*
this
rude
door
awakened
every
body
else
;
and
on
more
than
one
occasion
*NL*
I
had
remarked
that
the
islanders
were
nearly
as
irritable
as
more
*NL*
civilized
beings
under
similar
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
difficulty
thus
placed
in
my
way
I
,
determined
to
obviate
in
the
*NL*
following
manner
.
I
would
get
up
boldly
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
and
*NL*
drawing
the
slide
,
issue
from
the
house
,
and
pretend
that
my
object
was
*NL*
merely
to
procure
a
drink
from
the
calabash
,
which
always
stood
*NL*
without
the
dwelling
on
the
corner
of
the
pi-pi
.
On
re-entering
I
would
*NL*
purposely
omit
closing
the
passage
after
me
,
and
trusting
that
the
*NL*
indolence
of
the
savages
would
prevent
them
from
repairing
my
neglect
,
*NL*
would
return
to
my
mat
,
and
waiting
patiently
until
all
were
again
*NL*
asleep
,
I
would
then
steal
forth
,
and
at
once
take
the
route
to
*NL*
Pueearka
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
very
night
which
followed
Marnoo
's
departure
,
I
proceeded
to
put
*NL*
this
project
into
execution
.
About
midnight
,
as
I
imagined
,
I
arose
and
*NL*
drew
the
slide
.
The
natives
,
just
as
I
had
expected
,
started
up
,
while
*NL*
some
of
them
asked
,
`
Arware
poo
awa
,
Tommo
?
'
-LRB-
where
are
you
going
,
*NL*
Tommo
?
-RRB-
`
Wai
'
-LRB-
water
-RRB-
I
laconically
answered
,
grasping
the
calabash
.
On
*NL*
hearing
my
reply
they
sank
back
again
,
and
in
a
minute
or
two
I
returned
*NL*
to
my
mat
,
anxiously
awaiting
the
result
of
the
experiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
after
another
the
savages
,
turning
restlessly
,
appeared
to
resume
*NL*
their
slumbers
,
and
rejoicing
at
the
stillness
which
prevailed
,
I
was
*NL*
about
to
rise
again
from
my
couch
,
when
I
heard
a
slight
rustling
--
a
*NL*
dark
form
was
intercepted
between
me
and
the
doorway
--
the
slide
was
*NL*
drawn
across
it
,
and
the
individual
,
whoever
he
was
,
returned
to
*NL*
his
mat
.
This
was
a
sad
blow
to
me
;
but
as
it
might
have
aroused
the
*NL*
suspicions
of
the
islanders
to
have
made
another
attempt
that
night
,
I
*NL*
was
reluctantly
obliged
to
defer
it
until
the
next
.
Several
times
after
*NL*
I
repeated
the
same
manoeuvre
,
but
with
as
little
success
as
before
.
*NL*
As
my
pretence
for
withdrawing
from
the
house
was
to
allay
my
thirst
,
*NL*
Kory-Kory
either
suspecting
some
design
on
my
part
,
or
else
prompted
*NL*
by
a
desire
to
please
me
,
regularly
every
evening
placed
a
calabash
of
*NL*
water
by
my
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
,
under
these
inauspicious
circumstances
I
again
and
again
renewed
*NL*
the
attempt
,
but
when
I
did
so
,
my
valet
always
rose
with
me
,
as
if
*NL*
determined
I
should
not
remove
myself
from
his
observation
.
For
*NL*
the
present
,
therefore
,
I
was
obliged
to
abandon
the
attempt
;
but
I
*NL*
endeavoured
to
console
myself
with
the
idea
that
by
this
mode
I
might
*NL*
yet
effect
my
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
after
Marnoo
's
visit
I
was
reduced
to
such
a
state
that
it
was
*NL*
with
extreme
difficulty
I
could
walk
,
even
with
the
assistance
of
a
*NL*
spear
,
and
Kory-Kory
,
as
formerly
,
was
obliged
to
carry
me
daily
to
the
*NL*
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
hours
and
hours
during
the
warmest
part
of
the
day
I
lay
upon
my
*NL*
mat
,
and
while
those
around
me
were
nearly
all
dozing
away
in
careless
*NL*
ease
,
I
remained
awake
,
gloomily
pondering
over
the
fate
which
it
*NL*
appeared
now
idle
for
me
to
resist
,
when
I
thought
of
the
loved
friends
*NL*
who
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
miles
from
the
savage
island
in
*NL*
which
I
was
held
a
captive
,
when
I
reflected
that
my
dreadful
fate
would
*NL*
for
ever
be
concealed
from
them
,
and
that
with
hope
deferred
they
might
*NL*
continue
to
await
my
return
long
after
my
inanimate
form
had
blended
*NL*
with
the
dust
of
the
valley
--
I
could
not
repress
a
shudder
of
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
vividly
is
impressed
upon
my
mind
every
minute
feature
of
the
scene
*NL*
which
met
my
view
during
those
long
days
of
suffering
and
sorrow
.
At
my
*NL*
request
my
mats
were
always
spread
directly
facing
the
door
,
opposite
*NL*
which
,
and
at
a
little
distance
,
was
the
hut
of
boughs
that
Marheyo
was
*NL*
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whenever
my
gentle
Fayaway
and
Kory-Kory
,
laying
themselves
down
beside
*NL*
me
,
would
leave
me
awhile
to
uninterrupted
repose
,
I
took
a
strange
*NL*
interest
in
the
slightest
movements
of
the
eccentric
old
warrior
.
All
*NL*
alone
during
the
stillness
of
the
tropical
mid-day
,
he
would
pursue
his
*NL*
quiet
work
,
sitting
in
the
shade
and
weaving
together
the
leaflets
of
*NL*
his
cocoanut
branches
,
or
rolling
upon
his
knee
the
twisted
fibres
of
*NL*
bark
to
form
the
cords
with
which
he
tied
together
the
thatching
of
*NL*
his
tiny
house
.
Frequently
suspending
his
employment
,
and
noticing
my
*NL*
melancholy
eye
fixed
upon
him
,
he
would
raise
his
hand
with
a
gesture
*NL*
expressive
of
deep
commiseration
,
and
then
moving
towards
me
slowly
,
*NL*
would
enter
on
tip-toes
,
fearful
of
disturbing
the
slumbering
natives
,
*NL*
and
,
taking
the
fan
from
my
hand
,
would
sit
before
me
,
swaying
it
gently
*NL*
to
and
fro
,
and
gazing
earnestly
into
my
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
beyond
the
pi-pi
,
and
disposed
in
a
triangle
before
the
entrance
*NL*
of
the
house
,
were
three
magnificent
bread-fruit
trees
.
At
this
moment
I
*NL*
can
recap
to
my
mind
their
slender
shafts
,
and
the
graceful
inequalities
*NL*
of
their
bark
,
on
which
my
eye
was
accustomed
to
dwell
day
after
day
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
my
solitary
musings
.
It
is
strange
how
inanimate
objects
*NL*
will
twine
themselves
into
our
affections
,
especially
in
the
hour
of
*NL*
affliction
.
Even
now
,
amidst
all
the
bustle
and
stir
of
the
proud
and
*NL*
busy
city
in
which
I
am
dwelling
,
the
image
of
those
three
trees
seems
*NL*
to
come
as
vividly
before
my
eyes
as
if
they
were
actually
present
,
and
*NL*
I
still
feel
the
soothing
quiet
pleasure
which
I
then
had
in
watching
*NL*
hour
after
hour
their
topmost
boughs
waving
gracefully
in
the
breeze
.

*NL*
THE
ESCAPE
*NL*
*NL*
NEARLY
three
weeks
had
elapsed
since
the
second
visit
of
Marnoo
,
and
it
*NL*
must
have
been
more
than
four
months
since
I
entered
the
valley
,
when
*NL*
one
day
about
noon
,
and
whilst
everything
was
in
profound
silence
,
*NL*
Mow-Mow
,
the
one-eyed
chief
,
suddenly
appeared
at
the
door
,
and
leaning
*NL*
towards
me
as
I
lay
directly
facing
him
,
said
in
a
low
tone
,
`
Toby
pemi
*NL*
ena
'
-LRB-
Toby
has
arrived
here
-RRB-
.
Gracious
heaven
!
What
a
tumult
of
emotions
*NL*
rushed
upon
me
at
this
startling
intelligence
!
Insensible
to
the
pain
*NL*
that
had
before
distracted
me
,
I
leaped
to
my
feet
,
and
called
wildly
*NL*
to
Kory-Kory
who
was
reposing
by
my
side
.
The
startled
islanders
sprang
*NL*
from
their
mats
;
the
news
was
quickly
communicated
to
them
;
and
the
*NL*
next
moment
I
was
making
my
way
to
the
Ti
on
the
back
of
Kory-Kory
;
and
*NL*
surrounded
by
the
excited
savages
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
I
could
comprehend
of
the
particulars
which
Mow-Mow
rehearsed
*NL*
to
his
audience
as
we
proceeded
,
was
that
my
long-lost
companion
had
*NL*
arrived
in
a
boat
which
had
just
entered
the
bay
.
These
tidings
made
*NL*
me
most
anxious
to
be
carried
at
once
to
the
sea
,
lest
some
untoward
*NL*
circumstance
should
prevent
our
meeting
;
but
to
this
they
would
not
*NL*
consent
,
and
continued
their
course
towards
the
royal
abode
.
As
we
*NL*
approached
it
,
Mehevi
and
several
chiefs
showed
themselves
from
the
*NL*
piazza
,
and
called
upon
us
loudly
to
come
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
we
had
approached
,
I
endeavoured
to
make
them
understand
that
*NL*
I
was
going
down
to
the
sea
to
meet
Toby
.
To
this
the
king
objected
,
and
*NL*
motioned
Kory-Kory
to
bring
me
into
the
house
.
It
was
in
vain
to
resist
;
*NL*
and
in
a
few
moments
I
found
myself
within
the
Ti
,
surrounded
by
a
noisy
*NL*
group
engaged
in
discussing
the
recent
intelligence
.
Toby
's
name
was
*NL*
frequently
repeated
,
coupled
with
violent
exclamations
of
astonishment
.
*NL*
It
seemed
as
if
they
yet
remained
in
doubt
with
regard
to
the
fact
of
*NL*
his
arrival
,
at
at
every
fresh
report
that
was
brought
from
the
shore
*NL*
they
betrayed
the
liveliest
emotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
frenzied
at
being
held
in
this
state
of
suspense
,
I
passionately
*NL*
besought
Mehevi
to
permit
me
to
proceed
.
Whether
my
companion
had
*NL*
arrived
or
not
,
I
felt
a
presentiment
that
my
own
fate
was
about
to
be
*NL*
decided
.
Again
and
again
I
renewed
my
petition
to
Mehevi
.
He
regarded
me
*NL*
with
a
fixed
and
serious
eye
,
but
at
length
yielding
to
my
importunity
,
*NL*
reluctantly
granted
my
request
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accompanied
by
some
fifty
of
the
natives
,
I
now
rapidly
continued
my
*NL*
journey
;
every
few
moments
being
transferred
from
the
back
of
one
*NL*
to
another
,
and
urging
my
bearer
forward
all
the
while
with
earnest
*NL*
entreaties
.
As
I
thus
hurried
forward
,
no
doubt
as
to
the
truth
of
the
*NL*
information
I
had
received
ever
crossed
my
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
alive
only
to
the
one
overwhelming
idea
,
that
a
chance
of
*NL*
deliverance
was
now
afforded
me
,
if
the
jealous
opposition
of
the
*NL*
savages
could
be
overcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
been
prohibited
from
approaching
the
sea
during
the
whole
of
my
*NL*
stay
in
the
valley
,
I
had
always
associated
with
it
the
idea
of
escape
.
*NL*
Toby
too
--
if
indeed
he
had
ever
voluntarily
deserted
me
--
must
have
*NL*
effected
this
flight
by
the
sea
;
and
now
that
I
was
drawing
near
to
*NL*
it
myself
,
I
indulged
in
hopes
which
I
had
never
felt
before
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
a
boat
had
entered
the
bay
,
and
I
saw
little
reason
to
*NL*
doubt
the
truth
of
the
report
that
it
had
brought
my
companion
.
Every
*NL*
time
therefore
that
we
gained
an
elevation
,
I
looked
eagerly
around
,
*NL*
hoping
to
behold
him
.
In
the
midst
of
an
excited
throng
,
who
by
their
*NL*
violent
gestures
and
wild
cries
appeared
to
be
under
the
influence
of
*NL*
some
excitement
as
strong
as
my
own
,
I
was
now
borne
along
at
a
rapid
*NL*
trot
,
frequently
stooping
my
head
to
avoid
the
branches
which
crossed
*NL*
the
path
,
and
never
ceasing
to
implore
those
who
carried
me
to
*NL*
accelerate
their
already
swift
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
we
had
proceeded
about
four
or
five
miles
,
when
we
were
*NL*
met
by
a
party
of
some
twenty
islanders
,
between
whom
and
those
who
*NL*
accompanied
me
ensued
an
animated
conference
.
Impatient
of
the
delay
*NL*
occasioned
by
this
interruption
,
I
was
beseeching
the
man
who
carried
me
*NL*
to
proceed
without
his
loitering
companions
,
when
Kory-Kory
,
running
*NL*
to
my
side
,
informed
me
,
in
three
fatal
words
,
that
the
news
had
all
*NL*
proved
,
false
--
that
Toby
had
not
arrived
--
`
Toby
owlee
pemi
'
.
Heaven
only
*NL*
knows
how
,
in
the
state
of
mind
and
body
I
then
was
,
I
ever
sustained
*NL*
the
agony
which
this
intelligence
caused
me
;
not
that
the
news
was
*NL*
altogether
unexpected
;
but
I
had
trusted
that
the
fact
might
not
have
*NL*
been
made
known
until
we
should
have
arrived
upon
the
beach
.
As
it
was
,
*NL*
I
at
once
foresaw
the
course
the
savages
would
pursue
.
They
had
only
*NL*
yielded
thus
far
to
my
entreaties
,
that
I
might
give
a
joyful
welcome
to
*NL*
my
long-lost
comrade
;
but
now
that
it
was
known
he
had
not
arrived
they
*NL*
would
at
once
oblige
me
to
turn
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
anticipations
were
but
too
correct
.
In
spite
of
the
resistance
I
*NL*
made
,
they
carried
me
into
a
house
which
was
near
the
spot
,
and
left
me
*NL*
upon
the
mats
.
Shortly
afterwards
several
of
those
who
had
accompanied
*NL*
me
from
the
Ti
,
detaching
themselves
from
the
others
,
proceeded
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
sea
.
Those
who
remained
--
among
whom
were
Marheyo
,
*NL*
Mow-Mow
,
Kory-Kory
,
and
Tinor
--
gathered
about
the
dwelling
,
and
appeared
*NL*
to
be
awaiting
their
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
convinced
me
that
strangers
--
perhaps
some
of
my
own
countrymen
--
had
*NL*
for
some
cause
or
other
entered
the
bay
.
Distracted
at
the
idea
of
their
*NL*
vicinity
,
and
reckless
of
the
pain
which
I
suffered
,
I
heeded
not
the
*NL*
assurances
of
the
islanders
,
that
there
were
no
boats
at
the
beach
,
but
*NL*
starting
to
my
feet
endeavoured
to
gain
the
door
.
Instantly
the
passage
*NL*
was
blocked
up
by
several
men
,
who
commanded
me
to
resume
my
seat
.
The
*NL*
fierce
looks
of
the
irritated
savages
admonished
me
that
I
could
gain
*NL*
nothing
by
force
,
and
that
it
was
by
entreaty
alone
that
I
could
hope
to
*NL*
compass
my
object
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guided
by
this
consideration
,
I
turned
to
Mow-Mow
,
the
only
chief
*NL*
present
whom
I
had
been
much
in
the
habit
of
seeing
,
and
carefully
*NL*
concealing
,
my
real
design
,
tried
to
make
him
comprehend
that
I
still
*NL*
believed
Toby
to
have
arrived
on
the
shore
,
and
besought
him
to
allow
me
*NL*
to
go
forward
to
welcome
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
all
his
repeated
assertions
,
that
my
companion
had
not
been
seen
,
*NL*
I
pretended
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
,
while
I
urged
my
solicitations
with
an
*NL*
eloquence
of
gesture
which
the
one-eyed
chief
appeared
unable
to
resist
.
*NL*
He
seemed
indeed
to
regard
me
as
a
forward
child
,
to
whose
wishes
he
had
*NL*
not
the
heart
to
oppose
force
,
and
whom
he
must
consequently
humour
.
He
*NL*
spoke
a
few
words
to
the
natives
,
who
at
once
retreated
from
the
door
,
*NL*
and
I
immediately
passed
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
I
looked
earnestly
round
for
Kory-Kory
;
but
that
hitherto
faithful
*NL*
servitor
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
.
Unwilling
to
linger
even
for
a
single
*NL*
instant
when
every
moment
might
be
so
important
,
I
motioned
to
a
*NL*
muscular
fellow
near
me
to
take
me
upon
his
back
;
to
my
surprise
he
*NL*
angrily
refused
.
I
turned
to
another
,
but
with
a
like
result
.
A
third
*NL*
attempt
was
as
unsuccessful
,
and
I
immediately
perceived
what
had
*NL*
induced
Mow-Mow
to
grant
my
request
,
and
why
the
other
natives
conducted
*NL*
themselves
in
so
strange
a
manner
.
It
was
evident
that
the
chief
had
*NL*
only
given
me
liberty
to
continue
my
progress
towards
the
sea
,
because
*NL*
he
supposed
that
I
was
deprived
of
the
means
of
reaching
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Convinced
by
this
of
their
determination
to
retain
me
a
captive
,
I
*NL*
became
desperate
;
and
almost
insensible
to
the
pain
which
I
suffered
,
*NL*
I
seized
a
spear
which
was
leaning
against
the
projecting
eaves
of
the
*NL*
house
,
and
supporting
myself
with
it
,
resumed
the
path
that
swept
by
*NL*
the
dwelling
.
To
my
surprise
,
I
was
suffered
to
proceed
alone
;
all
*NL*
the
natives
remaining
in
front
of
the
house
,
and
engaging
in
earnest
*NL*
conversation
,
which
every
moment
became
more
loud
and
vehement
;
and
to
*NL*
my
unspeakable
delight
,
I
perceived
that
some
difference
of
opinion
*NL*
had
arisen
between
them
;
that
two
parties
,
in
short
,
were
formed
,
and
*NL*
consequently
that
in
their
divided
counsels
there
was
some
chance
of
my
*NL*
deliverance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
I
had
proceeded
a
hundred
yards
I
was
again
surrounded
by
the
*NL*
savages
,
who
were
still
in
all
the
heat
of
argument
,
and
appeared
every
*NL*
moment
as
if
they
would
come
to
blows
.
In
the
midst
of
this
tumult
*NL*
old
Marheyo
came
to
my
side
,
and
I
shall
never
forget
the
benevolent
*NL*
expression
of
his
countenance
.
He
placed
his
arm
upon
my
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
emphatically
pronounced
the
only
two
English
words
I
had
taught
him
*NL*
`
Home
'
and
`
Mother
'
.
I
at
once
understood
what
he
meant
,
and
eagerly
*NL*
expressed
my
thanks
to
him
.
Fayaway
and
Kory-Kory
were
by
his
side
,
both
*NL*
weeping
violently
;
and
it
was
not
until
the
old
man
had
twice
repeated
*NL*
the
command
that
his
son
could
bring
himself
to
obey
him
,
and
take
me
*NL*
again
upon
his
back
.
The
one-eyed
chief
opposed
his
doing
so
,
but
he
was
*NL*
overruled
,
and
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
by
some
of
his
own
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
proceeded
onwards
,
and
never
shall
I
forget
the
ecstasy
I
felt
when
I
*NL*
first
heard
the
roar
of
the
surf
breaking
upon
the
beach
.
Before
long
*NL*
I
saw
the
flashing
billows
themselves
through
the
opening
between
the
*NL*
trees
.
Oh
glorious
sight
and
sound
of
ocean
!
with
what
rapture
did
I
*NL*
hail
you
as
familiar
friends
!
By
this
time
the
shouts
of
the
crowd
*NL*
upon
the
beach
were
distinctly
audible
,
and
in
the
blended
confusion
*NL*
of
sounds
I
almost
fancied
I
could
distinguish
the
voices
of
my
own
*NL*
countrymen
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
we
reached
the
open
space
which
lay
between
the
groves
and
the
sea
,
*NL*
the
first
object
that
met
my
view
was
an
English
whale-boat
,
lying
with
*NL*
her
bow
pointed
from
the
shore
,
and
only
a
few
fathoms
distant
from
it
.
*NL*
It
was
manned
by
five
islanders
,
dressed
in
shirt
tunics
of
calico
.
My
*NL*
first
impression
was
that
they
were
in
the
very
act
of
pulling
out
from
*NL*
the
bay
;
and
that
,
after
all
my
exertions
,
I
had
come
too
late
.
My
soul
*NL*
sunk
within
me
:
but
a
second
glance
convinced
me
that
the
boat
was
only
*NL*
hanging
off
to
keep
out
of
the
surf
;
and
the
next
moment
I
heard
my
own
*NL*
name
shouted
out
by
a
voice
from
the
midst
of
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
,
I
perceived
,
to
my
indescribable
*NL*
joy
,
the
tall
figure
of
Karakoee
,
an
Oahu
Kanaka
,
who
had
often
been
*NL*
aboard
the
`
Dolly
'
,
while
she
lay
in
Nukuheva
.
He
wore
the
green
*NL*
shooting-jacket
with
gilt
buttons
,
which
had
been
given
to
him
by
an
*NL*
officer
of
the
Reine
Blanche
--
the
French
flag-ship
--
and
in
which
I
had
*NL*
always
seen
him
dressed
.
I
now
remembered
the
Kanaka
had
frequently
told
*NL*
me
that
his
person
was
tabooed
in
all
the
valleys
of
the
island
,
and
the
*NL*
sight
of
him
at
such
a
moment
as
this
filled
my
heart
with
a
tumult
of
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Karakoee
stood
near
the
edge
of
the
water
with
a
large
roll
of
*NL*
cotton-cloth
thrown
over
one
arm
,
and
holding
two
or
three
canvas
bags
*NL*
of
powder
,
while
with
the
other
hand
he
grasped
a
musket
,
which
he
*NL*
appeared
to
be
proffering
to
several
of
the
chiefs
around
him
.
But
they
*NL*
turned
with
disgust
from
his
offers
and
seemed
to
be
impatient
at
*NL*
his
presence
,
with
vehement
gestures
waving
him
off
to
his
boat
,
and
*NL*
commanding
him
to
depart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Kanaka
,
however
,
still
maintained
his
ground
,
and
I
at
once
*NL*
perceived
that
he
was
seeking
to
purchase
my
freedom
.
Animated
by
the
*NL*
idea
,
I
called
upon
him
loudly
to
come
to
me
;
but
he
replied
,
in
broken
*NL*
English
,
that
the
islanders
had
threatened
to
pierce
him
with
their
*NL*
spears
,
if
he
stirred
a
foot
towards
me
.
At
this
time
I
was
still
*NL*
advancing
,
surrounded
by
a
dense
throng
of
the
natives
,
several
of
whom
*NL*
had
their
hands
upon
me
,
and
more
than
one
javelin
was
threateningly
*NL*
pointed
at
me
.
Still
I
perceived
clearly
that
many
of
those
least
*NL*
friendly
towards
me
looked
irresolute
and
anxious
.
I
was
still
some
*NL*
thirty
yards
from
Karakoee
when
my
farther
progress
was
prevented
by
the
*NL*
natives
,
who
compelled
me
to
sit
down
upon
the
ground
,
while
they
still
*NL*
retained
their
hold
upon
my
arms
.
The
din
and
tumult
now
became
tenfold
,
*NL*
and
I
perceived
that
several
of
the
priests
were
on
the
spot
,
all
of
*NL*
whom
were
evidently
urging
Mow-Mow
and
the
other
chiefs
to
prevent
my
*NL*
departure
;
and
the
detestable
word
`
Roo-ne
!
Roo-ne
!
'
which
I
had
heard
*NL*
repeated
a
thousand
times
during
the
day
,
was
now
shouted
out
on
every
*NL*
side
of
me
.
Still
I
saw
that
the
Kanaka
continued
his
exertions
in
my
*NL*
favour
--
that
he
was
boldly
debating
the
matter
with
the
savages
,
and
was
*NL*
striving
to
entice
them
by
displaying
his
cloth
and
powder
,
and
snapping
*NL*
the
lock
of
his
musket
.
But
all
he
said
or
did
appeared
only
to
augment
*NL*
the
clamours
of
those
around
him
,
who
seemed
bent
upon
driving
him
into
*NL*
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
remembered
the
extravagant
value
placed
by
these
people
upon
the
*NL*
articles
which
were
offered
to
them
in
exchange
for
me
,
and
which
*NL*
were
so
indignantly
rejected
,
I
saw
a
new
proof
of
the
same
fixed
*NL*
determination
of
purpose
they
had
all
along
manifested
with
regard
*NL*
to
me
,
and
in
despair
,
and
reckless
of
consequences
,
I
exerted
all
my
*NL*
strength
,
and
shaking
myself
free
from
the
grasp
of
those
who
held
me
,
I
*NL*
sprang
upon
my
feet
and
rushed
towards
Karakoee
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rash
attempt
nearly
decided
my
fate
;
for
,
fearful
that
I
might
slip
*NL*
from
them
,
several
of
the
islanders
now
raised
a
simultaneous
shout
,
*NL*
and
pressing
upon
Karakoee
,
they
menaced
him
with
furious
gestures
,
and
*NL*
actually
forced
him
into
the
sea
.
Appalled
at
their
violence
,
the
poor
*NL*
fellow
,
standing
nearly
to
the
waist
in
the
surf
,
endeavoured
to
pacify
*NL*
them
;
but
at
length
fearful
that
they
would
do
him
some
fatal
violence
,
*NL*
he
beckoned
to
his
comrades
to
pull
in
at
once
,
and
take
him
into
the
*NL*
boat
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
agonizing
moment
,
when
I
thought
all
hope
was
ended
,
that
*NL*
a
new
contest
arose
between
the
two
parties
who
had
accompanied
me
to
*NL*
the
shore
;
blows
were
struck
,
wounds
were
given
,
and
blood
flowed
.
In
*NL*
the
interest
excited
by
the
fray
,
every
one
had
left
me
except
Marheyo
,
*NL*
Kory-Kory
and
poor
dear
Fayaway
,
who
clung
to
me
,
sobbing
indignantly
.
*NL*
I
saw
that
now
or
never
was
the
moment
.
Clasping
my
hands
together
,
I
*NL*
looked
imploringly
at
Marheyo
,
and
move
towards
the
now
almost
deserted
*NL*
beach
.
The
tears
were
in
the
old
man
's
eyes
,
but
neither
he
nor
*NL*
Kory-Kory
attempted
to
hold
me
,
and
I
soon
reached
the
Kanaka
,
who
had
*NL*
anxiously
watched
my
movements
;
the
rowers
pulled
in
as
near
as
they
*NL*
dared
to
the
edge
of
the
surf
;
I
gave
one
parting
embrace
to
Fayaway
,
*NL*
who
seemed
speechless
with
sorrow
,
and
the
next
instant
I
found
myself
*NL*
safe
in
the
boat
,
and
Karakoee
by
my
side
,
who
told
the
rowers
at
once
*NL*
to
give
way
.
Marheyo
and
Kory-Kory
,
and
a
great
many
of
the
women
,
*NL*
followed
me
into
the
water
,
and
I
was
determined
,
as
the
only
mark
of
*NL*
gratitude
I
could
show
,
to
give
them
the
articles
which
had
been
brought
*NL*
as
my
ransom
.
I
handed
the
musket
to
Kory-Kory
,
with
a
rapid
gesture
*NL*
which
was
equivalent
to
a
`
Deed
of
Gift
'
;
threw
the
roll
of
cotton
to
*NL*
old
Marheyo
,
pointing
as
I
did
so
to
poor
Fayaway
,
who
had
retired
from
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
water
and
was
sitting
down
disconsolate
on
the
shingles
;
*NL*
and
tumbled
the
powder-bags
out
to
the
nearest
young
ladies
,
all
of
whom
*NL*
were
vastly
willing
to
take
them
.
This
distribution
did
not
occupy
ten
*NL*
seconds
,
and
before
it
was
over
the
boat
was
under
full
way
;
the
Kanaka
*NL*
all
the
while
exclaiming
loudly
against
what
he
considered
a
useless
*NL*
throwing
away
of
valuable
property
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
it
was
clear
that
my
movements
had
been
noticed
by
several
of
*NL*
the
natives
,
still
they
had
not
suspended
the
conflict
in
which
they
*NL*
were
engaged
,
and
it
was
not
until
the
boat
was
above
fifty
yards
from
*NL*
the
shore
that
Mow-Mow
and
some
six
or
seven
other
warriors
rushed
into
*NL*
the
sea
and
hurled
their
javelins
at
us
.
Some
of
the
weapons
passed
*NL*
quite
as
close
to
us
as
was
desirable
,
but
no
one
was
wounded
,
and
the
*NL*
men
pulled
away
gallantly
.
But
although
soon
out
of
the
reach
of
the
*NL*
spears
,
our
progress
was
extremely
slow
;
it
blew
strong
upon
the
shore
,
*NL*
and
the
tide
was
against
us
;
and
I
saw
Karakoee
,
who
was
steering
the
*NL*
boat
,
give
many
a
look
towards
a
jutting
point
of
the
bay
round
which
we
*NL*
had
to
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
minute
or
two
after
our
departure
,
the
savages
,
who
had
formed
*NL*
into
different
groups
,
remained
perfectly
motionless
and
silent
.
All
*NL*
at-once
the
enraged
chief
showed
by
his
gestures
that
he
had
resolved
*NL*
what
course
he
would
take
.
Shouting
loudly
to
his
companions
,
and
*NL*
pointing
with
his
tomahawk
towards
the
headland
,
he
set
off
at
full
*NL*
speed
in
that
direction
,
and
was
followed
by
about
thirty
of
the
*NL*
natives
,
among
whom
were
several
of
the
priests
,
all
yelling
out
*NL*
`
Roo-ne
!
Roo-ne
!
'
at
the
very
top
of
their
voices
.
Their
intention
was
*NL*
evidently
to
swim
off
from
the
headland
and
intercept
us
in
our
course
.
*NL*
The
wind
was
freshening
every
minute
,
and
was
right
in
our
teeth
,
and
it
*NL*
was
one
of
those
chopping
angry
seas
in
which
it
is
so
difficult
to
*NL*
row
.
Still
the
chances
seemed
in
our
favour
,
but
when
we
came
within
a
*NL*
hundred
yards
of
the
point
,
the
active
savages
were
already
dashing
into
*NL*
the
water
,
and
we
all
feared
that
within
five
minutes
'
time
we
should
*NL*
have
a
score
of
the
infuriated
wretches
around
us
.
If
so
our
doom
*NL*
was
sealed
,
for
these
savages
,
unlike
the
feeble
swimmer
of
civilized
*NL*
countries
,
are
,
if
anything
,
more
formidable
antagonists
in
the
water
*NL*
than
when
on
the
land
.
It
was
all
a
trial
of
strength
;
our
natives
*NL*
pulled
till
their
oars
bent
again
,
and
the
crowd
of
swimmers
shot
*NL*
through
the
water
despite
its
roughness
,
with
fearful
rapidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
we
had
reached
the
headland
,
the
savages
were
spread
right
*NL*
across
our
course
.
Our
rowers
got
out
their
knives
and
held
them
ready
*NL*
between
their
teeth
,
and
I
seized
the
boat-hook
.
We
were
all
aware
that
*NL*
if
they
succeeded
in
intercepting
us
they
would
practise
upon
us
the
*NL*
manoeuvre
which
has
proved
so
fatal
to
many
a
boat
's
crew
in
these
seas
.
*NL*
They
would
grapple
the
oars
,
and
seizing
hold
of
the
gunwhale
,
capsize
*NL*
the
boat
,
and
then
we
should
be
entirely
at
their
mercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
breathless
moments
discerned
Mow-Mow
.
The
athletic
islander
,
*NL*
with
his
tomahawk
between
his
teeth
,
was
dashing
the
water
before
him
*NL*
till
it
foamed
again
.
He
was
the
nearest
to
us
,
and
in
another
instant
*NL*
he
would
have
seized
one
of
the
oars
.
Even
at
the
moment
I
felt
horror
*NL*
at
the
act
I
was
about
to
commit
;
but
it
was
no
time
for
pity
or
*NL*
compunction
,
and
with
a
true
aim
,
and
exerting
all
my
strength
,
I
dashed
*NL*
the
boat-hook
at
him
.
It
struck
him
just
below
the
throat
,
and
forced
*NL*
him
downwards
.
I
had
no
time
to
repeat
the
blow
,
but
I
saw
him
rise
*NL*
to
the
surface
in
the
wake
of
the
boat
,
and
never
shall
I
forget
the
*NL*
ferocious
expression
of
his
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
one
other
of
the
savages
reached
the
boat
.
He
seized
the
gunwhale
,
*NL*
but
the
knives
of
our
rowers
so
mauled
his
wrists
,
that
he
was
forced
to
*NL*
quit
his
hold
,
and
the
next
minute
we
were
past
them
all
,
and
in
safety
.
*NL*
The
strong
excitement
which
had
thus
far
kept
me
up
,
now
left
me
,
and
I
*NL*
fell
back
fainting
into
the
arms
of
Karakoee
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
...
*NL*
*NL*
The
circumstances
connected
with
my
most
unexpected
escape
may
be
very
*NL*
briefly
stated
.
The
captain
of
an
Australian
vessel
,
being
in
distress
*NL*
for
men
in
these
remote
seas
,
had
put
into
Nukuheva
in
order
to
recruit
*NL*
his
ship
's
company
;
but
not
a
single
man
was
to
be
obtained
;
and
the
*NL*
barque
was
about
to
get
under
weigh
,
when
she
was
boarded
by
Karakoee
,
*NL*
who
informed
the
disappointed
Englishman
that
an
American
sailor
*NL*
was
detained
by
the
savages
in
the
neighbouring
bay
of
Typee
;
and
he
*NL*
offered
,
if
supplied
with
suitable
articles
of
traffic
,
to
undertake
his
*NL*
release
.
The
Kanaka
had
gained
his
intelligence
from
Marnoo
,
to
whom
,
*NL*
after
all
,
I
was
indebted
for
my
escape
.
The
proposition
was
acceded
to
;
*NL*
and
Karakoee
,
taking
with
him
five
tabooed
natives
of
Nukuheva
,
again
*NL*
repaired
aboard
the
barque
,
which
in
a
few
hours
sailed
to
that
part
of
*NL*
the
island
,
and
threw
her
main-top-sail
aback
right
off
the
entrance
*NL*
to
the
Typee
bay
.
The
whale-boat
,
manned
by
the
tabooed
crew
,
pulled
*NL*
towards
the
head
of
the
inlet
,
while
the
ship
lay
`
off
and
on
'
awaiting
*NL*
its
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
events
which
ensued
have
already
been
detailed
,
and
little
more
*NL*
remains
to
be
related
.
On
reaching
the
`
Julia
'
I
was
lifted
over
the
*NL*
side
,
and
my
strange
appearance
and
remarkable
adventure
occasioned
the
*NL*
liveliest
interest
.
Every
attention
was
bestowed
upon
me
that
humanity
*NL*
could
suggest
.
But
to
such
a
state
was
I
reduced
,
that
three
months
*NL*
elapsed
before
I
recovered
my
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mystery
which
hung
over
the
fate
of
my
friend
and
companion
Toby
has
*NL*
never
been
cleared
up
.
I
still
remain
ignorant
whether
he
succeeded
in
*NL*
leaving
the
valley
,
or
perished
at
the
hands
of
the
islanders
.

THE
STORY
OF
TOBY
*NL*
*NL*
THE
morning
my
comrade
left
me
,
as
related
in
the
narrative
,
he
was
*NL*
accompanied
by
a
large
party
of
the
natives
,
some
of
them
carrying
fruit
*NL*
and
hogs
for
the
purposes
of
traffic
,
as
the
report
had
spread
that
*NL*
boats
had
touched
at
the
bay
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
proceeded
through
the
settled
parts
of
the
valley
,
numbers
*NL*
joined
them
from
every
side
,
running
with
animated
cries
from
every
*NL*
pathway
.
So
excited
were
the
whole
party
,
that
eager
as
Toby
was
to
gain
*NL*
the
beach
,
it
was
almost
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
keep
up
with
them
.
*NL*
Making
the
valley
ring
with
their
shouts
,
they
hurried
along
on
a
swift
*NL*
trot
,
those
in
advance
pausing
now
and
then
,
and
flourishing
their
*NL*
weapons
to
urge
the
rest
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
they
came
to
a
place
where
the
paths
crossed
a
bend
of
the
*NL*
main
stream
of
the
valley
.
Here
a
strange
sound
came
through
the
grove
*NL*
beyond
,
and
the
Islanders
halted
.
It
was
Mow-Mow
,
the
one-eyed
chief
,
*NL*
who
had
gone
on
before
;
he
was
striking
his
heavy
lance
against
the
*NL*
hollow
bough
of
a
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
signal
of
alarm
;
--
for
nothing
was
now
heard
but
shouts
*NL*
of
`
Happar
!
Happar
!
'
--
the
warriors
tilting
with
their
spears
and
*NL*
brandishing
them
in
the
air
,
and
the
women
and
boys
shouting
to
each
*NL*
other
,
and
picking
up
the
stones
in
the
bed
of
the
stream
.
In
a
moment
*NL*
or
two
Mow-Mow
and
two
or
three
other
chiefs
ran
out
from
the
grove
,
and
*NL*
the
din
increased
ten
fold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
thought
Toby
,
for
a
fray
;
and
being
unarmed
,
he
besought
one
of
the
*NL*
young
men
domiciled
with
Marheyo
for
the
loan
of
his
spear
.
But
he
was
*NL*
refused
;
the
youth
roguishly
telling
him
that
the
weapon
was
very
good
*NL*
for
him
-LRB-
the
Typee
-RRB-
,
but
that
a
white
man
could
fight
much
better
with
*NL*
his
fists
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
merry
humour
of
this
young
wag
seemed
to
be
shared
by
the
rest
,
for
*NL*
in
spite
of
their
warlike
cries
and
gestures
,
everybody
was
capering
*NL*
and
laughing
,
as
if
it
was
one
of
the
funniest
things
in
the
world
to
be
*NL*
awaiting
the
flight
of
a
score
or
two
of
Happar
javelins
from
an
ambush
*NL*
in
the
thickets
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
my
comrade
was
in
vain
trying
to
make
out
the
meaning
of
all
this
,
*NL*
a
good
number
of
the
natives
separated
themselves
from
the
rest
and
ran
*NL*
off
into
the
grove
on
one
side
,
the
others
now
keeping
perfectly
still
,
*NL*
as
if
awaiting
the
result
.
After
a
little
while
,
however
,
Mow-Mow
,
who
*NL*
stood
in
advance
,
motioned
them
to
come
on
stealthily
,
which
they
did
,
*NL*
scarcely
rustling
a
leaf
.
Thus
they
crept
along
for
ten
or
fifteen
*NL*
minutes
,
every
now
and
then
pausing
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toby
by
no
means
relished
this
sort
of
skulking
;
if
there
was
going
to
*NL*
be
a
fight
,
he
wanted
it
to
begin
at
once
.
But
all
in
good
time
,
--
for
*NL*
just
then
,
as
they
went
prowling
into
the
thickest
of
the
wood
,
terrific
*NL*
howls
burst
upon
them
on
all
sides
,
and
volleys
of
darts
and
stones
flew
*NL*
across
the
path
.
Not
an
enemy
was
to
be
seen
,
and
what
was
still
more
*NL*
surprising
,
not
a
single
man
dropped
,
though
the
pebbles
fell
among
the
*NL*
leaves
like
hail
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
's
pause
,
when
the
Typees
,
with
wild
shrieks
,
flung
*NL*
themselves
into
the
covert
,
spear
in
hand
;
nor
was
Toby
behindhand
.
*NL*
Coming
so
near
getting
his
skull
broken
by
the
stones
,
and
animated
by
*NL*
an
old
grudge
he
bore
the
Happars
,
he
was
among
the
first
to
dash
at
*NL*
them
.
As
he
broke
his
way
through
the
underbush
,
trying
,
as
he
did
*NL*
so
,
to
wrest
a
spear
from
a
young
chief
,
the
shouts
of
battle
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
ceased
,
and
the
wood
was
as
still
as
death
.
The
next
moment
,
the
*NL*
party
who
had
left
them
so
mysteriously
rushed
out
from
behind
every
*NL*
bush
and
tree
,
and
united
with
the
rest
in
long
and
merry
peals
of
*NL*
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
a
sham
,
and
Toby
,
who
was
quite
out
of
breath
with
*NL*
excitement
,
was
much
incensed
at
being
made
a
fool
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
afterwards
turned
out
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
concerted
for
*NL*
his
particular
benefit
,
though
with
what
precise
view
it
would
be
hard
*NL*
to
tell
.
My
comrade
was
the
more
enraged
at
this
boys
'
play
,
since
it
*NL*
had
consumed
so
much
time
,
every
moment
of
which
might
be
precious
.
*NL*
Perhaps
,
however
,
it
was
partly
intended
for
this
very
purpose
;
and
he
*NL*
was
led
to
think
so
,
because
when
the
natives
started
again
,
he
observed
*NL*
that
they
did
not
seem
to
be
in
so
great
a
hurry
as
before
.
At
last
,
*NL*
after
they
had
gone
some
distance
,
Toby
,
thinking
all
the
while
that
*NL*
they
never
would
get
to
the
sea
,
two
men
came
running
towards
them
,
*NL*
and
a
regular
halt
ensued
,
followed
by
a
noisy
discussion
,
during
which
*NL*
Toby
's
name
was
often
repeated
.
All
this
made
him
more
and
more
anxious
*NL*
to
learn
what
was
going
on
at
the
beach
;
but
it
was
in
vain
that
he
now
*NL*
tried
to
push
forward
;
the
natives
held
him
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
moments
the
conference
ended
,
and
many
of
them
ran
down
the
*NL*
path
in
the
direction
of
the
water
,
the
rest
surrounding
Toby
,
and
*NL*
entreating
him
to
`
Moee
'
,
or
sit
down
and
rest
himself
.
As
an
additional
*NL*
inducement
,
several
calabashes
of
food
,
which
had
been
brought
along
,
*NL*
were
now
placed
on
the
ground
,
and
opened
,
and
pipes
also
were
lighted
.
*NL*
Toby
bridled
his
impatience
a
while
,
but
at
last
sprang
to
his
feet
*NL*
and
dashed
forward
again
.
He
was
soon
overtaken
nevertheless
,
and
again
*NL*
surrounded
,
but
without
further
detention
was
then
permitted
to
go
down
*NL*
to
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
out
upon
a
bright
green
space
between
the
groves
and
the
*NL*
water
,
and
close
under
the
shadow
of
the
Happar
mountain
,
where
a
path
*NL*
was
seen
winding
out
of
sight
through
a
gorge
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sign
of
a
boat
,
however
,
was
beheld
,
nothing
but
a
tumultuous
crowd
*NL*
of
men
and
women
,
and
some
one
in
their
midst
,
earnestly
talking
to
*NL*
them
.
As
my
comrade
advanced
,
this
person
came
forward
and
proved
to
*NL*
be
no
stranger
.
He
was
an
old
grizzled
sailor
,
whom
Toby
and
myself
had
*NL*
frequently
seen
in
Nukuheva
,
where
he
lived
an
easy
devil-may-care
life
*NL*
in
the
household
of
Mowanna
the
king
,
going
by
the
name
of
`
Jimmy
'
.
*NL*
In
fact
he
was
the
royal
favourite
,
and
had
a
good
deal
to
say
in
his
*NL*
master
's
councils
.
He
wore
a
Manilla
hat
and
a
sort
of
tappa
morning
*NL*
gown
,
sufficiently
loose
and
negligent
to
show
the
verse
of
a
song
*NL*
tattooed
upon
his
chest
,
and
a
variety
of
spirited
cuts
by
native
*NL*
artists
in
other
parts
of
his
body
.
He
sported
a
fishing
rod
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
carried
a
sooty
old
pipe
slung
about
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
old
rover
having
retired
from
active
life
,
had
resided
in
Nukuheva
*NL*
some
time
--
could
speak
the
language
,
and
for
that
reason
was
frequently
*NL*
employed
by
the
French
as
an
interpreter
.
He
was
an
arrant
old
gossip
*NL*
too
;
for
ever
coming
off
in
his
canoe
to
the
ships
in
the
bay
,
and
*NL*
regaling
their
crews
with
choice
little
morsels
of
court
scandal
--
such
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
as
a
shameful
intrigue
of
his
majesty
with
a
Happar
*NL*
damsel
,
a
public
dancer
at
the
feasts
--
and
otherwise
relating
some
*NL*
incredible
tales
about
the
Marquesas
generally
.
I
remember
in
particular
*NL*
his
telling
the
Dolly
's
crew
what
proved
to
be
literally
a
cock-and-bull
*NL*
story
,
about
two
natural
prodigies
which
he
said
were
then
on
the
*NL*
island
.
One
was
an
old
monster
of
a
hermit
,
having
a
marvellous
*NL*
reputation
for
sanctity
,
and
reputed
a
famous
sorcerer
,
who
lived
away
*NL*
off
in
a
den
among
the
mountains
,
where
he
hid
from
the
world
a
*NL*
great
pair
of
horns
that
grew
out
of
his
temples
.
Notwithstanding
his
*NL*
reputation
for
piety
,
this
horrid
old
fellow
was
the
terror
of
all
the
*NL*
island
round
,
being
reported
to
come
out
from
his
retreat
,
and
go
a
*NL*
man-hunting
every
dark
night
.
Some
anonymous
Paul
Pry
,
too
,
coming
down
*NL*
the
mountain
,
once
got
a
peep
at
his
den
,
and
found
it
full
of
bones
.
In
*NL*
short
,
he
was
a
most
unheard-of
monster
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
prodigy
Jimmy
told
us
about
was
the
younger
son
of
a
chief
,
*NL*
who
,
although
but
just
turned
of
ten
,
had
entered
upon
holy
orders
,
*NL*
because
his
superstitious
countrymen
thought
him
especially
intended
*NL*
for
the
priesthood
from
the
fact
of
his
having
a
comb
on
his
head
like
*NL*
a
rooster
.
But
this
was
not
all
;
for
still
more
wonderful
to
relate
,
the
*NL*
boy
prided
himself
upon
his
strange
crest
,
being
actually
endowed
with
a
*NL*
cock
's
voice
,
and
frequently
crowing
over
his
peculiarity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
to
return
to
Toby
.
The
moment
he
saw
the
old
rover
on
the
beach
,
he
*NL*
ran
up
to
him
,
the
natives
following
after
,
and
forming
a
circle
round
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
welcoming
him
to
the
shore
,
Jimmy
went
on
to
tell
him
how
that
he
*NL*
knew
all
about
our
having
run
away
from
the
ship
,
and
being
among
the
*NL*
Typees
.
Indeed
,
he
had
been
urged
by
Mowanna
to
come
over
to
the
valley
,
*NL*
and
after
visiting
his
friends
there
,
to
bring
us
back
with
him
,
his
*NL*
royal
master
being
exceedingly
anxious
to
share
with
him
the
reward
*NL*
which
had
been
held
out
for
our
capture
.
He
,
however
,
assured
Toby
that
*NL*
he
had
indignantly
spurned
the
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
astonished
my
comrade
not
a
little
,
as
neither
of
us
had
*NL*
entertained
the
least
idea
that
any
white
man
ever
visited
the
Typees
*NL*
sociably
.
But
Jimmy
told
him
that
such
was
the
case
nevertheless
,
*NL*
although
he
seldom
came
into
the
bay
,
and
scarcely
ever
went
back
*NL*
from
the
beach
.
One
of
the
priests
of
the
valley
,
in
some
way
or
other
*NL*
connected
with
an
old
tattooed
divine
in
Nukuheva
,
was
a
friend
of
his
,
*NL*
and
through
him
he
was
`
taboo
'
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
,
moreover
,
that
he
was
sometimes
employed
to
come
round
to
the
*NL*
bay
,
and
engage
fruit
for
ships
lying
in
Nukuheva
.
In
fact
,
he
was
now
*NL*
on
that
very
errand
,
according
to
his
own
account
,
having
just
come
*NL*
across
the
mountains
by
the
way
of
Happar
.
By
noon
of
the
next
day
the
*NL*
fruit
would
be
heaped
up
in
stacks
on
the
beach
,
in
readiness
for
the
*NL*
boats
which
he
then
intended
to
bring
into
the
bay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmy
now
asked
Toby
whether
he
wished
to
leave
the
island
--
if
he
did
,
*NL*
there
was
a
ship
in
want
of
men
lying
in
the
other
harbour
,
and
he
would
*NL*
be
glad
to
take
him
over
,
and
see
him
on
board
that
very
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
'
said
Toby
,
'
I
can
not
leave
the
island
unless
my
comrade
goes
with
*NL*
me
.
I
left
him
up
the
valley
because
they
would
not
let
him
come
down
.
*NL*
Let
us
go
now
and
fetch
him
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
how
is
he
to
cross
the
mountain
with
us
,
'
replied
Jimmy
,
`
even
if
*NL*
we
get
him
down
to
the
beach
?
Better
let
him
stay
till
tomorrow
,
and
I
*NL*
will
bring
him
round
to
Nukuheva
in
the
boats
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
will
never
do
,
'
said
Toby
,
`
but
come
along
with
me
now
,
and
let
*NL*
us
get
him
down
here
at
any
rate
,
'
and
yielding
to
the
impulse
of
the
*NL*
moment
,
he
started
to
hurry
back
into
the
valley
.
But
hardly
was
his
*NL*
back
turned
,
when
a
dozen
hands
were
laid
on
him
,
and
he
learned
that
he
*NL*
could
not
go
a
step
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
he
fought
with
them
;
they
would
not
hear
of
his
*NL*
stirring
from
the
beach
.
Cut
to
the
heart
at
this
unexpected
repulse
,
*NL*
Toby
now
conjured
the
sailor
to
go
after
me
alone
.
But
Jimmy
replied
,
*NL*
that
in
the
mood
the
Typees
then
were
they
would
not
permit
him
so
to
*NL*
do
,
though
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
afraid
of
their
offering
him
any
*NL*
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
did
Toby
then
think
,
as
he
afterwards
had
good
reason
to
suspect
,
*NL*
that
this
very
Jimmy
was
a
heartless
villain
,
who
,
by
his
arts
,
had
just
*NL*
incited
the
natives
to
restrain
him
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
going
after
*NL*
me
.
Well
must
the
old
sailor
have
known
,
too
,
that
the
natives
would
*NL*
never
consent
to
our
leaving
together
,
and
he
therefore
wanted
to
get
*NL*
Toby
off
alone
,
for
a
purpose
which
he
afterwards
made
plain
.
Of
all
*NL*
this
,
however
,
my
comrade
now
knew
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
struggling
with
the
islanders
when
Jimmy
again
came
up
to
*NL*
him
,
and
warned
him
against
irritating
them
,
saying
that
he
was
only
*NL*
making
matters
worse
for
both
of
us
,
and
if
they
became
enraged
,
there
*NL*
was
no
telling
what
might
happen
.
At
last
he
made
Toby
sit
down
on
a
*NL*
broken
canoe
by
a
pile
of
stones
,
upon
which
was
a
ruinous
little
shrine
*NL*
supported
by
four
upright
poles
,
and
in
front
partly
screened
by
a
net
.
*NL*
The
fishing
parties
met
there
,
when
they
came
in
from
the
sea
,
for
their
*NL*
offerings
were
laid
before
an
image
,
upon
a
smooth
black
stone
within
.
*NL*
This
spot
Jimmy
said
was
strictly
`
taboo
'
,
and
no
one
would
molest
or
*NL*
come
near
him
while
he
stayed
by
its
shadow
.
The
old
sailor
then
went
*NL*
off
,
and
began
speaking
very
earnestly
to
Mow-Mow
and
some
other
chiefs
,
*NL*
while
all
the
rest
formed
a
circle
round
the
taboo
place
,
looking
*NL*
intently
at
Toby
,
and
talking
to
each
other
without
ceasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
notwithstanding
what
Jimmy
had
just
told
him
,
there
presently
came
*NL*
up
to
my
comrade
an
old
woman
,
who
seated
herself
beside
him
on
the
*NL*
canoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Typee
motarkee
?
'
said
she
.
`
Motarkee
nuee
,
'
said
Toby
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
then
asked
him
whether
he
was
going
to
Nukuheva
;
he
nodded
yes
;
and
*NL*
with
a
plaintive
wail
and
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
she
rose
and
left
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
old
woman
,
the
sailor
afterwards
said
,
was
the
wife
of
an
aged
king
*NL*
of
a
small
island
valley
,
communicating
by
a
deep
pass
with
the
country
*NL*
of
the
Typees
.
The
inmates
of
the
two
valleys
were
related
to
each
other
*NL*
by
blood
,
and
were
known
by
the
same
name
.
The
old
woman
had
gone
down
*NL*
into
the
Typee
valley
the
day
before
,
and
was
now
with
three
chiefs
,
her
*NL*
sons
,
on
a
visit
to
her
kinsmen
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
old
king
's
wife
left
him
,
Jimmy
again
came
up
to
Toby
,
and
told
*NL*
him
that
he
had
just
talked
the
whole
matter
over
with
the
natives
,
and
*NL*
there
was
only
one
course
for
him
to
follow
.
They
would
not
allow
him
to
*NL*
go
back
into
the
valley
,
and
harm
would
certainly
come
to
both
him
and
*NL*
me
,
if
he
remained
much
longer
on
the
beach
.
`
So
,
'
said
he
,
`
you
and
I
*NL*
had
better
go
to
Nukuheva
now
overland
,
and
tomorrow
I
will
bring
Tommo
,
*NL*
as
they
call
him
,
by
water
;
they
have
promised
to
carry
him
down
to
the
*NL*
sea
for
me
early
in
the
morning
,
so
that
there
will
be
no
delay
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
,
no
,
'
said
Toby
desperately
,
'
I
will
not
leave
him
that
way
;
we
must
*NL*
escape
together
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
there
is
no
hope
for
you
,
'
exclaimed
the
sailor
,
`
for
if
I
leave
*NL*
you
here
on
the
beach
,
as
soon
as
I
am
gone
you
will
be
carried
back
*NL*
into
the
valley
,
and
then
neither
of
you
will
ever
look
upon
the
*NL*
sea
again
.
'
And
with
many
oaths
he
swore
that
if
he
would
only
go
to
*NL*
Nukuheva
with
him
that
day
,
he
would
be
sure
to
have
me
there
the
very
*NL*
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
how
do
you
know
they
will
bring
him
down
to
the
beach
tomorrow
,
*NL*
when
they
will
not
do
so
today
?
'
said
Toby
.
But
the
sailor
had
many
*NL*
reasons
,
all
of
which
were
so
mixed
up
with
the
mysterious
customs
*NL*
of
the
islanders
,
that
he
was
none
the
wiser
.
Indeed
,
their
conduct
,
*NL*
especially
in
preventing
him
from
returning
into
the
valley
,
was
*NL*
absolutely
unaccountable
to
him
;
and
added
to
everything
else
,
was
the
*NL*
bitter
reflection
,
that
the
old
sailor
,
after
all
,
might
possibly
be
*NL*
deceiving
him
.
And
then
again
he
had
to
think
of
me
,
left
alone
with
the
*NL*
natives
,
and
by
no
means
well
.
If
he
went
with
Jimmy
,
he
might
at
least
*NL*
hope
to
procure
some
relief
for
me
.
But
might
not
the
savages
who
had
*NL*
acted
so
strangely
,
hurry
me
off
somewhere
before
his
return
?
Then
,
even
*NL*
if
he
remained
,
perhaps
they
would
not
let
him
go
back
into
the
valley
*NL*
where
I
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
perplexed
was
my
poor
comrade
;
he
knew
not
what
to
do
,
and
his
*NL*
courageous
spirit
was
of
no
use
to
him
now
.
There
he
was
,
all
by
*NL*
himself
,
seated
upon
the
broken
canoe
--
the
natives
grouped
around
him
at
*NL*
a
distance
,
and
eyeing
him
more
and
more
fixedly
.
`
It
is
getting
late
:
*NL*
said
Jimmy
,
who
was
standing
behind
the
rest
.
`
Nukuheva
is
far
off
,
and
*NL*
I
can
not
cross
the
Happar
country
by
night
.
You
see
how
it
is
;
--
if
you
*NL*
come
along
with
me
,
all
will
be
well
;
if
you
do
not
,
depend
upon
it
,
*NL*
neither
of
you
will
ever
escape
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
no
help
for
it
,
'
said
Toby
,
at
last
,
with
a
heavy
heart
,
'
I
*NL*
will
have
to
trust
you
,
'
and
he
came
out
from
the
shadow
of
the
little
*NL*
shrine
,
and
cast
a
long
look
up
the
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
keep
close
to
my
side
,
'
said
the
sailor
,
`
and
let
us
be
moving
*NL*
quickly
.
'
Tinor
and
Fayaway
here
appeared
;
the
kindhearted
old
woman
*NL*
embracing
Toby
's
knees
,
and
giving
way
to
a
flood
of
tears
;
while
*NL*
Fayaway
,
hardly
less
moved
,
spoke
some
few
words
of
English
she
had
*NL*
learned
,
and
held
up
three
fingers
before
him
--
in
so
many
days
he
would
*NL*
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Jimmy
pulled
Toby
out
of
the
crowd
,
and
after
calling
to
a
*NL*
young
Typee
who
was
standing
by
with
a
young
pig
in
his
arms
,
all
three
*NL*
started
for
the
mountains
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
told
them
that
you
are
coming
back
again
,
'
said
the
old
fellow
,
*NL*
laughing
,
as
they
began
the
ascent
,
`
but
they
'll
have
to
wait
a
long
*NL*
time
.
'
Toby
turned
,
and
saw
the
natives
all
in
motion
--
the
girls
waving
*NL*
their
tappas
in
adieu
,
and
the
men
their
spears
.
As
the
last
figure
*NL*
entered
the
grove
with
one
arm
raised
,
and
the
three
fingers
spread
,
his
*NL*
heart
smote
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
natives
had
at
last
consented
to
his
going
,
it
might
have
been
,
*NL*
that
some
of
them
,
at
least
,
really
counted
upon
his
speedy
return
;
*NL*
probably
supposing
,
as
indeed
he
had
told
them
when
they
were
coming
*NL*
down
the
valley
,
that
his
only
object
in
leaving
them
was
to
procure
the
*NL*
medicines
I
needed
.
This
,
Jimmy
also
must
have
told
them
.
And
as
they
*NL*
had
done
before
,
when
my
comrade
,
to
oblige
me
,
started
on
his
perilous
*NL*
journey
to
Nukuheva
,
they
looked
upon
me
,
in
his
absence
,
as
one
of
two
*NL*
inseparable
friends
who
was
a
sure
guaranty
for
the
other
's
return
.
*NL*
This
is
only
my
own
supposition
,
however
,
for
as
to
all
their
strange
*NL*
conduct
,
it
is
still
a
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
see
what
sort
of
a
taboo
man
I
am
,
'
said
the
sailor
,
after
for
some
*NL*
time
silently
following
the
path
which
led
up
the
mountain
.
`
Mow-Mow
*NL*
made
me
a
present
of
this
pig
here
,
and
the
man
who
carries
it
will
*NL*
go
right
through
Happar
,
and
down
into
Nukuheva
with
us
.
So
long
as
he
*NL*
stays
by
me
he
is
safe
,
and
just
so
it
will
be
with
you
,
and
tomorrow
*NL*
with
Tommo
.
Cheer
up
,
then
,
and
rely
upon
me
,
you
will
see
him
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
ascent
of
the
mountain
was
not
very
difficult
,
owing
to
its
being
*NL*
near
to
the
sea
,
where
the
island
ridges
are
comparatively
low
;
the
*NL*
path
,
too
,
was
a
fine
one
,
so
that
in
a
short
time
all
three
were
*NL*
standing
on
the
summit
with
the
two
valleys
at
their
feet
.
The
white
*NL*
cascade
marking
the
green
head
of
the
Typee
valley
first
caught
Toby
's
*NL*
eye
;
Marheyo
's
house
could
easily
be
traced
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Jimmy
led
the
way
along
the
ridge
,
Toby
observed
that
the
valley
of
*NL*
the
Happars
did
not
extend
near
so
far
inland
as
that
of
the
Typees
.
*NL*
This
accounted
for
our
mistake
in
entering
the
latter
valley
as
we
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
path
leading
down
from
the
mountain
was
soon
seen
,
and
,
following
it
,
*NL*
the
party
were
in
a
short
time
fairly
in
the
Happar
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Now
,
'
said
Jimmy
,
as
they
hurried
on
,
`
we
taboo
men
have
wives
in
all
*NL*
the
bays
,
and
I
am
going
to
show
you
the
two
I
have
here
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
when
they
came
to
the
house
where
he
said
they
lived
,
--
which
was
*NL*
close
by
the
base
of
the
mountain
in
a
shady
nook
among
the
groves
--
he
*NL*
went
in
,
and
was
quite
furious
at
finding
it
empty
--
the
ladies
,
had
gone
*NL*
out
.
However
,
they
soon
made
their
appearance
,
and
to
tell
the
truth
,
*NL*
welcomed
Jimmy
quite
cordially
,
as
well
as
Toby
,
about
whom
they
were
*NL*
very
inquisitive
.
Nevertheless
,
as
the
report
of
their
arrival
spread
,
*NL*
and
the
Happars
began
to
assemble
,
it
became
evident
that
the
appearance
*NL*
of
a
white
stranger
among
them
was
not
by
any
means
deemed
so
wonderful
*NL*
an
event
as
in
the
neighbouring
valley
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
sailor
now
bade
his
wives
prepare
something
to
eat
,
as
he
must
*NL*
be
in
Nukuheva
before
dark
.
A
meal
of
fish
,
bread-fruit
,
and
bananas
,
*NL*
was
accordingly
served
up
,
the
party
regaling
themselves
on
the
mats
,
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
a
numerous
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Happars
put
many
questions
to
Jimmy
about
Toby
;
and
Toby
himself
*NL*
looked
sharply
at
them
,
anxious
to
recognize
the
fellow
who
gave
him
the
*NL*
wound
from
which
he
was
still
suffering
.
But
this
fiery
gentleman
,
so
*NL*
handy
with
his
spear
,
had
the
delicacy
,
it
seemed
,
to
keep
out
of
view
.
*NL*
Certainly
the
sight
of
him
would
not
have
been
any
added
inducement
to
*NL*
making
a
stay
in
the
valley
,
--
some
of
the
afternoon
loungers
in
Happar
*NL*
having
politely
urged
Toby
to
spend
a
few
days
with
them
,
--
there
was
a
*NL*
feast
coming
on
.
He
,
however
,
declined
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
the
young
Typee
stuck
to
Jimmy
like
his
shadow
,
and
*NL*
though
as
lively
a
dog
as
any
of
his
tribe
,
he
was
now
as
meek
as
*NL*
a
lamb
,
never
opening
his
mouth
except
to
eat
.
Although
some
of
the
*NL*
Happars
looked
queerly
at
him
,
others
were
more
civil
,
and
seemed
*NL*
desirous
of
taking
him
abroad
and
showing
him
the
valley
.
But
the
Typee
*NL*
was
not
to
be
cajoled
in
that
way
.
How
many
yards
he
would
have
to
*NL*
remove
from
Jimmy
before
the
taboo
would
be
powerless
,
it
would
be
hard
*NL*
to
tell
,
but
probably
he
himself
knew
to
a
fraction
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
promise
of
a
red
cotton
handkerchief
,
and
something
else
which
he
*NL*
kept
secret
,
this
poor
fellow
had
undertaken
a
rather
ticklish
journey
,
*NL*
though
,
as
far
as
Toby
could
ascertain
,
it
was
something
that
had
never
*NL*
happened
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
island-punch
--
arva
--
was
brought
in
at
the
conclusion
of
the
repast
,
*NL*
and
passed
round
in
a
shallow
calabash
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
my
comrade
,
while
seated
in
the
Happar
house
,
began
to
feel
more
*NL*
troubled
than
ever
at
leaving
me
;
indeed
,
so
sad
did
he
feel
that
he
*NL*
talked
about
going
back
to
the
valley
,
and
wanted
Jimmy
to
escort
him
*NL*
as
far
as
the
mountains
.
But
the
sailor
would
not
listen
to
him
,
and
,
by
*NL*
way
of
diverting
his
thoughts
,
pressed
him
to
drink
of
the
arva
.
Knowing
*NL*
its
narcotic
nature
,
he
refused
;
but
Jimmy
said
he
would
have
something
*NL*
mixed
with
it
,
which
would
convert
it
into
an
innocent
beverage
that
*NL*
would
inspirit
them
for
the
rest
of
their
journey
.
So
at
last
he
was
*NL*
induced
to
drink
of
it
,
and
its
effects
were
just
as
the
sailor
had
*NL*
predicted
;
his
spirits
rose
at
once
,
and
all
his
gloomy
thoughts
left
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
rover
now
began
to
reveal
his
true
character
,
though
he
was
*NL*
hardly
suspected
at
the
time
.
`
If
I
get
you
off
to
a
ship
,
'
said
he
,
*NL*
`
you
will
surely
give
a
poor
fellow
something
for
saving
you
.
'
In
short
,
*NL*
before
they
left
the
house
,
he
made
Toby
promise
that
he
would
give
him
*NL*
five
Spanish
dollars
if
he
succeeded
in
getting
any
part
of
his
wages
*NL*
advanced
from
the
vessel
,
aboard
of
which
they
were
going
;
Toby
,
*NL*
moreover
,
engaging
to
reward
him
still
further
,
as
soon
as
my
*NL*
deliverance
was
accomplished
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
while
after
this
they
started
again
,
accompanied
by
many
of
the
*NL*
natives
,
and
going
up
the
valley
,
took
a
steep
path
near
its
head
,
*NL*
which
led
to
Nukuheva
.
Here
the
Happars
paused
and
watched
them
as
they
*NL*
ascended
the
mountain
,
one
group
of
bandit-looking
fellows
,
shaking
*NL*
their
spears
and
casting
threatening
glances
at
the
poor
Typee
,
whose
*NL*
heart
as
well
as
heels
seemed
much
the
lighter
when
he
came
to
look
down
*NL*
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
gaining
the
heights
once
more
,
their
way
led
for
a
time
along
several
*NL*
ridges
covered
with
enormous
ferns
.
At
last
they
entered
upon
a
wooded
*NL*
tract
,
and
here
they
overtook
a
party
of
Nukuheva
natives
,
well
armed
,
*NL*
and
carrying
bundles
of
long
poles
.
Jimmy
seemed
to
know
them
all
very
*NL*
well
,
and
stopped
for
a
while
,
and
had
a
talk
about
the
`
Wee-Wees
'
,
as
*NL*
the
people
of
Nukuheva
call
the
Monsieurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
party
with
the
poles
were
King
Mowanna
's
men
,
and
by
his
orders
they
*NL*
had
been
gathering
them
in
the
ravines
for
his
allies
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
these
fellows
to
trudge
on
with
their
loads
,
Toby
and
his
*NL*
companions
now
pushed
forward
again
,
as
the
sun
was
already
low
in
the
*NL*
west
.
They
came
upon
the
valleys
of
Nukuheva
on
one
side
of
the
bay
,
*NL*
where
the
highlands
slope
off
into
the
sea
.
The
men-of-war
were
still
*NL*
lying
in
the
harbour
,
and
as
Toby
looked
down
upon
them
,
the
strange
*NL*
events
which
had
happened
so
recently
,
seemed
all
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
soon
descended
towards
the
beach
,
and
found
themselves
in
Jimmy
's
*NL*
house
before
it
was
well
dark
.
Here
he
received
another
welcome
from
*NL*
his
Nukuheva
wives
,
and
after
some
refreshments
in
the
shape
of
cocoanut
*NL*
milk
and
poee-poee
,
they
entered
a
canoe
-LRB-
the
Typee
of
course
going
*NL*
along
-RRB-
and
paddled
off
to
a
whaleship
which
was
anchored
near
the
shore
.
*NL*
This
was
the
vessel
in
want
of
men
.
Our
own
had
sailed
some
time
before
.
*NL*
The
captain
professed
great
pleasure
at
seeing
Toby
,
but
thought
from
*NL*
his
exhausted
appearance
that
he
must
be
unfit
for
duty
.
However
,
he
*NL*
agreed
to
ship
him
,
as
well
as
his
comrade
,
as
soon
as
he
should
arrive
.
*NL*
Toby
begged
hard
for
an
armed
boat
,
in
which
to
go
round
to
Typee
and
*NL*
rescue
me
,
notwithstanding
the
promises
of
Jimmy
.
But
this
the
captain
*NL*
would
not
hear
of
,
and
told
him
to
have
patience
,
for
the
sailor
would
*NL*
be
faithful
to
his
word
.
When
,
too
,
he
demanded
the
five
silver
dollars
*NL*
for
Jimmy
,
the
captain
was
unwilling
to
give
them
.
But
Toby
insisted
*NL*
upon
it
,
as
he
now
began
to
think
that
Jimmy
might
be
a
mere
mercenary
,
*NL*
who
would
be
sure
to
prove
faithless
if
not
well
paid
.
Accordingly
he
*NL*
not
only
gave
him
the
money
,
but
took
care
to
assure
him
,
over
and
over
*NL*
again
,
that
as
soon
as
he
brought
me
aboard
he
would
receive
a
still
*NL*
larger
sum
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
sun-rise
the
next
day
,
Jimmy
and
the
Typee
started
in
two
of
the
*NL*
ship
's
boats
,
which
were
manned
by
tabooed
natives
.
Toby
,
of
course
,
was
*NL*
all
eagerness
to
go
along
,
but
the
sailor
told
him
that
if
he
did
,
it
*NL*
would
spoil
all
;
so
,
hard
as
it
was
,
he
was
obliged
to
remain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
evening
he
was
on
the
watch
,
and
descried
the
boats
turning
the
*NL*
headland
and
entering
the
bay
.
He
strained
his
eyes
,
and
thought
he
saw
*NL*
me
;
but
I
was
not
there
.
Descending
from
the
mast
almost
distracted
,
he
*NL*
grappled
Jimmy
as
he
struck
the
deck
,
shouting
in
a
voice
that
startled
*NL*
him
,
`
Where
is
Tommo
?
'
The
old
fellow
faltered
,
but
soon
recovering
,
*NL*
did
all
he
could
to
soothe
him
,
assuring
him
that
it
had
proved
to
be
*NL*
impossible
to
get
me
down
to
the
shore
that
morning
;
assigning
many
*NL*
plausible
reasons
,
and
adding
that
early
on
the
morrow
he
was
going
to
*NL*
visit
the
bay
again
in
a
French
boat
,
when
,
if
he
did
not
find
me
on
the
*NL*
beach
--
as
this
time
he
certainly
expected
to
--
he
would
march
right
back
*NL*
into
the
valley
,
and
carry
me
away
at
all
hazards
.
He
,
however
,
again
*NL*
refused
to
allow
Toby
to
accompany
him
.
Now
,
situated
as
Toby
was
,
his
*NL*
sole
dependence
for
the
present
was
upon
this
Jimmy
,
and
therefore
he
*NL*
was
fain
to
comfort
himself
as
well
as
he
could
with
what
the
old
sailor
*NL*
told
him
.
The
next
morning
,
however
,
he
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
*NL*
the
French
boat
start
with
Jimmy
in
it
.
Tonight
,
then
,
I
will
see
him
,
*NL*
thought
Toby
;
but
many
a
long
day
passed
before
he
ever
saw
Tommo
again
.
*NL*
Hardly
was
the
boat
out
of
sight
,
when
the
captain
came
forward
and
*NL*
ordered
the
anchor
weighed
;
he
was
going
to
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vain
were
all
Toby
's
ravings
--
they
were
disregarded
;
and
when
he
came
to
*NL*
himself
,
the
sails
were
set
,
and
the
ship
fast
leaving
the
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
`
Oh
!
'
said
he
to
me
at
our
meeting
,
`
what
sleepless
nights
were
*NL*
mine
.
Often
I
started
from
my
hammock
,
dreaming
you
were
before
me
,
and
*NL*
upbraiding
me
for
leaving
you
on
the
island
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
...
.
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
little
more
to
be
related
.
Toby
left
this
vessel
at
New
*NL*
Zealand
,
and
after
some
further
adventures
,
arrived
home
in
less
than
*NL*
two
years
after
leaving
the
Marquesas
.
He
always
thought
of
me
as
*NL*
dead
--
and
I
had
every
reason
to
suppose
that
he
too
was
no
more
;
but
a
*NL*
strange
meeting
was
in
store
for
us
,
one
which
made
Toby
's
heart
all
the
*NL*
lighter
.

NOTE
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
author
was
more
than
two
years
in
the
South
Seas
,
after
escaping
*NL*
from
the
valley
,
as
recounted
in
the
last
chapter
.
Some
time
after
*NL*
returning
home
the
foregoing
narrative
was
published
,
though
it
was
*NL*
little
thought
at
the
time
that
this
would
be
the
means
of
revealing
*NL*
the
existence
of
Toby
,
who
had
long
been
given
up
for
lost
.
But
so
it
*NL*
proved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
of
his
escape
supplies
a
natural
sequel
to
the
adventure
,
and
*NL*
as
such
it
is
now
added
to
the
volume
.
It
was
related
to
the
author
by
*NL*
Toby
himself
,
not
ten
days
since
.
